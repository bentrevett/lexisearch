  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:04.580\n The following is a conversation with Stephen Kotkin, a professor of history at Princeton\n\n00:04.580 --> 00:10.360\n University and one of the great historians of our time, specializing in Russian and Soviet\n\n00:10.360 --> 00:11.360\n history.\n\n00:11.360 --> 00:15.640\n He has written many books on Stalin and the Soviet Union, including the first two of a\n\n00:15.640 --> 00:21.000\n three volume work on Stalin, and he is currently working on volume three.\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:25.400\n You may have noticed that I've been speaking with not just computer scientists, but physicists,\n\n00:25.400 --> 00:29.720\n engineers, historians, neuroscientists, and soon much more.\n\n00:29.720 --> 00:34.160\n To me, artificial intelligence is much bigger than deep learning, bigger than computing.\n\n00:34.160 --> 00:40.120\n It is our civilization's journey into understanding the human mind and creating echoes of it in\n\n00:40.120 --> 00:41.560\n the machine.\n\n00:41.560 --> 00:50.380\n To me, that journey must include a deep historical and psychological understanding of power.\n\n00:50.380 --> 00:53.840\n Technology puts some of the greatest power in the history of our civilization into the\n\n00:53.840 --> 00:56.720\n hands of engineers and computer scientists.\n\n00:56.720 --> 00:59.340\n This power must not be abused.\n\n00:59.340 --> 01:04.880\n And the best way to understand how such abuse can be avoided is to not be blind to the lessons\n\n01:04.880 --> 01:05.880\n of history.\n\n01:05.880 --> 01:12.760\n As Stephen Kotkin brilliantly articulates, Stalin was arguably one of the most powerful\n\n01:12.760 --> 01:14.360\n humans in history.\n\n01:14.360 --> 01:20.280\n I've read many books on Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Putin, and the wars of the 20th century.\n\n01:20.280 --> 01:25.920\n I hope you understand the value of such knowledge to all of us, especially to engineers and\n\n01:25.920 --> 01:31.160\n scientists who built the tools of power in the 21st century.\n\n01:31.160 --> 01:33.200\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:33.200 --> 01:39.560\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it 5 stars on Apple Podcast, follow on Spotify,\n\n01:39.560 --> 01:44.300\n support on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F R\n\n01:44.300 --> 01:46.800\n I D M A N.\n\n01:46.800 --> 01:51.000\n I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction, I'll do one or two minutes\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:55.280\n after introducing the episode, and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow\n\n01:55.280 --> 01:56.280\n of the conversation.\n\n01:56.280 --> 02:01.520\n I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n02:01.520 --> 02:06.000\n This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:10.640\n I personally use Cash App to send money to friends, but you can also use it to buy, sell,\n\n02:10.640 --> 02:13.160\n and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.\n\n02:13.160 --> 02:15.240\n Cash App also has an investing feature.\n\n02:15.240 --> 02:21.120\n You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is.\n\n02:21.120 --> 02:27.520\n Your services are provided by Cash App Investing, a subsidiary of Square, and member SIPC.\n\n02:27.520 --> 02:31.440\n I'm excited to be working with Cash App to support one of my favorite organizations\n\n02:31.440 --> 02:36.160\n called FIRST, best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.\n\n02:36.160 --> 02:41.440\n They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students in over 110 countries and have\n\n02:41.440 --> 02:46.520\n a perfect rating on Charity Navigator, which means the donated money is used to maximum\n\n02:46.520 --> 02:48.200\n effectiveness.\n\n02:48.200 --> 02:53.160\n When you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play, and use code LexPodcast, you'll\n\n02:53.160 --> 02:58.680\n get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, which again, is an organization\n\n02:58.680 --> 03:05.560\n that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering a better world.\n\n03:05.560 --> 03:11.060\n And now, here's my conversation with Stephen Kotkin.\n\n03:11.060 --> 03:13.880\n Do all human beings crave power?\n\n03:13.880 --> 03:15.340\n No.\n\n03:15.340 --> 03:18.100\n Human beings crave security.\n\n03:18.100 --> 03:20.160\n They crave love.\n\n03:20.160 --> 03:22.880\n They crave adventure.\n\n03:22.880 --> 03:26.580\n They crave power, but not equally.\n\n03:26.580 --> 03:29.880\n Some human beings nevertheless do crave power.\n\n03:29.880 --> 03:30.880\n For sure.\n\n03:30.880 --> 03:34.780\n What words is that deeply in the psychology of people?\n\n03:34.780 --> 03:36.500\n Is it something you're born with?\n\n03:36.500 --> 03:38.820\n Is it something you develop?\n\n03:38.820 --> 03:49.500\n Some people crave a position of leadership or of standing out, of being recognized, and\n\n03:49.500 --> 03:53.400\n that could be starting out in the school years on the schoolyard.\n\n03:53.400 --> 03:58.760\n It could be within their own family, not just in their peer group.\n\n03:58.760 --> 04:04.520\n Those kind of people we often see craving leadership positions from a young age often\n\n04:04.520 --> 04:06.960\n end up in positions of power.\n\n04:06.960 --> 04:09.700\n But they can be varied positions of power.\n\n04:09.700 --> 04:15.400\n You can have power in an institution where your power is purposefully limited.\n\n04:15.400 --> 04:21.180\n For example, there's a board or a consultative body or a separation of powers.\n\n04:21.180 --> 04:27.620\n Not everyone craves power whereby they're the sole power or they're their unconstrained\n\n04:27.620 --> 04:29.020\n power.\n\n04:29.020 --> 04:30.760\n That's a little bit less usual.\n\n04:30.760 --> 04:35.840\n We may think that everybody does, but not everybody does.\n\n04:35.840 --> 04:44.300\n Those people who do crave that kind of power, unconstrained, the ability to decide as much\n\n04:44.300 --> 04:49.660\n as life or death of other people, those people are not everyday people.\n\n04:49.660 --> 04:54.840\n They're not the people you encounter in your daily life for the most part.\n\n04:54.840 --> 04:57.460\n Those are extraordinary people.\n\n04:57.460 --> 05:01.500\n Most of them don't have the opportunity to live that dream.\n\n05:01.500 --> 05:05.460\n Very few of them, in fact, end up with the opportunity to live that dream.\n\n05:05.460 --> 05:13.100\n So percentage wise, in your sense, if we think of George Washington, for example, would most\n\n05:13.100 --> 05:20.620\n people given the choice of absolute power over a country versus maybe the capped power\n\n05:20.620 --> 05:27.380\n that the United States presidential role, at least at the founding of the country represented,\n\n05:27.380 --> 05:29.340\n what do you think most people would choose?\n\n05:29.340 --> 05:36.260\n Well, Washington was in a position to exercise far greater power than he did.\n\n05:36.260 --> 05:40.500\n And in fact, he didn't take that option.\n\n05:40.500 --> 05:49.780\n He was more interested in seeing institutionalization, of seeing the country develop strong institutions\n\n05:49.780 --> 05:54.340\n rather than an individual leader like himself have excess power.\n\n05:54.340 --> 05:56.460\n So that's very important.\n\n05:56.460 --> 06:01.660\n So like I said, not everyone craves unconstrained power, even if they're very ambitious.\n\n06:01.660 --> 06:03.860\n And of course, Washington was very ambitious.\n\n06:03.860 --> 06:08.900\n He was a successful general before he was a president.\n\n06:08.900 --> 06:14.100\n So that clearly comes from the influences on your life, where you grow up, how you grow\n\n06:14.100 --> 06:20.800\n up, how you raised, what kind of values are imparted to you along the way.\n\n06:20.800 --> 06:27.060\n You can understand power as the ability to share, or you can understand or the ability\n\n06:27.060 --> 06:34.180\n to advance something for the collective in a collective process, not an individual process.\n\n06:34.180 --> 06:38.060\n So power comes in many different varieties.\n\n06:38.060 --> 06:43.420\n And ambition doesn't always equate to despotic power.\n\n06:43.420 --> 06:51.580\n Right power is something different from ordinary institutional power that we see.\n\n06:51.580 --> 06:55.500\n The president of MIT does not have unconstrained power.\n\n06:55.500 --> 07:01.980\n The president of MIT rightly must consult with other members of the administration,\n\n07:01.980 --> 07:07.260\n with the faculty members, to a certain extent with the student body and certainly with the\n\n07:07.260 --> 07:10.300\n trustees of MIT.\n\n07:10.300 --> 07:17.620\n Those constraints make the institution strong and enduring and make the decisions better\n\n07:17.620 --> 07:21.020\n than they would be if he had unconstrained power.\n\n07:21.020 --> 07:24.180\n But you can't say that the president is not ambitious.\n\n07:24.180 --> 07:27.080\n Of course, the president is ambitious.\n\n07:27.080 --> 07:29.640\n We worry about unconstrained power.\n\n07:29.640 --> 07:33.900\n We worry about executive authority that's not limited.\n\n07:33.900 --> 07:37.740\n That's the definition of authoritarianism or tyranny.\n\n07:37.740 --> 07:42.740\n Unlimited or barely limited executive authority.\n\n07:42.740 --> 07:46.300\n Executive authority is necessary to carry out many functions.\n\n07:46.300 --> 07:47.540\n We all understand that.\n\n07:47.540 --> 07:51.780\n That's why MIT has an executive, has a president.\n\n07:51.780 --> 08:00.560\n But unlimited or largely unconstrained executive power is detrimental to even the person who\n\n08:00.560 --> 08:02.700\n exercises that power.\n\n08:02.700 --> 08:04.500\n So what do you think?\n\n08:04.500 --> 08:06.140\n It's an interesting notion.\n\n08:06.140 --> 08:11.740\n We kind of take it for granted that constraints on executive power is a good thing.\n\n08:11.740 --> 08:14.200\n But why is that necessarily true?\n\n08:14.200 --> 08:21.920\n So what is it about absolute power that does something bad to the human mind?\n\n08:21.920 --> 08:27.220\n So you know, the popular saying of absolute power corrupts absolutely.\n\n08:27.220 --> 08:28.900\n Is that the case?\n\n08:28.900 --> 08:35.220\n That the power in itself is the thing that corrupts the mind in some kind of way where\n\n08:35.220 --> 08:39.020\n it leads to a bad leadership over time?\n\n08:39.020 --> 08:42.420\n People make more mistakes when they're not challenged.\n\n08:42.420 --> 08:48.240\n When they don't have to explain things and get others to vote and go along with it.\n\n08:48.240 --> 08:54.740\n When they can make a decision without anybody being able to block their decision or to have\n\n08:54.740 --> 08:57.580\n input necessarily on their decision.\n\n08:57.580 --> 08:59.660\n You're more prone to mistakes.\n\n08:59.660 --> 09:02.060\n You're more prone to extremism.\n\n09:02.060 --> 09:04.080\n There's a temptation there.\n\n09:04.080 --> 09:08.400\n For example, we have separation of powers in the United States.\n\n09:08.400 --> 09:15.540\n The Congress, right, has authority that the president doesn't have.\n\n09:15.540 --> 09:19.500\n As for example, in budgeting, the so called power of the purse.\n\n09:19.500 --> 09:21.820\n This can be very frustrating.\n\n09:21.820 --> 09:26.300\n People want to see things happen and they complain that there's a do nothing Congress\n\n09:26.300 --> 09:30.340\n or that the situation is stalemated.\n\n09:30.340 --> 09:33.860\n But actually that's potentially a good thing.\n\n09:33.860 --> 09:37.140\n In fact, that's how our system was designed.\n\n09:37.140 --> 09:42.100\n Our system was designed to prevent things happening in government.\n\n09:42.100 --> 09:47.500\n And there's frustration with that, but ultimately that's the strength of the institutions we\n\n09:47.500 --> 09:48.500\n have.\n\n09:48.500 --> 09:54.220\n And so when you see unconstrained executive authority, there can be a lot of dynamism.\n\n09:54.220 --> 09:57.300\n A lot of things can get done quickly.\n\n09:57.300 --> 10:02.220\n But those things can be like, for example, what happened in China under Mao or what happened\n\n10:02.220 --> 10:08.700\n in the Soviet Union under Stalin or what happened in Haiti under Papa Doc and then Baby Doc\n\n10:08.700 --> 10:10.880\n or fill in the blank, right?\n\n10:10.880 --> 10:18.540\n What happens sometimes in corporations where a corporate leader is not constrained by the\n\n10:18.540 --> 10:21.660\n shareholders, by the board or by anything.\n\n10:21.660 --> 10:26.720\n And they can seem to be a genius for a while, but eventually it catches up to them.\n\n10:26.720 --> 10:32.280\n And so the idea of constraints on executive power is absolutely fundamental to the American\n\n10:32.280 --> 10:35.600\n system, American way of thinking.\n\n10:35.600 --> 10:42.780\n And not only America, obviously large other parts of the world that have a similar system,\n\n10:42.780 --> 10:48.440\n not an identical system, but a similar system of checks and balances on executive power.\n\n10:48.440 --> 10:56.980\n And so the case that I study, the only checks and balances on executive power are circumstantial.\n\n10:56.980 --> 11:04.060\n So for example, distances in the country, it's hard to do something over 5,000 miles\n\n11:04.060 --> 11:09.300\n or the amount of time in a day, it's hard for a leader to get to every single thing\n\n11:09.300 --> 11:13.380\n the leader wants to get to because there are only 24 hours in a day.\n\n11:13.380 --> 11:16.740\n Those are circumstantial constraints on executive power.\n\n11:16.740 --> 11:20.740\n They're not institutional constraints on executive power.\n\n11:20.740 --> 11:27.160\n One of the constraints on executive power that United States has versus Russia, maybe\n\n11:27.160 --> 11:30.940\n something you've implied and actually spoke directly to is there's something in the Russian\n\n11:30.940 --> 11:38.980\n people and the Soviet people that are attracted to authoritarian power, psychologically speaking,\n\n11:38.980 --> 11:45.420\n or at least the kind of leaders that sought authoritarian power throughout its history.\n\n11:45.420 --> 11:51.100\n And that desire for that kind of human is a lack of a constraint.\n\n11:51.100 --> 11:58.060\n In America, it seems as people, we desire somebody not like Stalin, somebody more like\n\n11:58.060 --> 11:59.100\n George Washington.\n\n11:59.100 --> 12:04.540\n So that's another constraint, the belief of the people, what they admire in a leader,\n\n12:04.540 --> 12:06.740\n what they seek in a leader.\n\n12:06.740 --> 12:14.340\n So maybe you can speak to, well, first of all, can you speak briefly to that psychology\n\n12:14.340 --> 12:20.340\n of, is there a difference between the Russian people and the American people in terms of\n\n12:20.340 --> 12:24.220\n just what we find attractive in a leader?\n\n12:24.220 --> 12:27.820\n Not as great a difference as it might seem.\n\n12:27.820 --> 12:34.500\n There are unfortunately many Americans who would be happy with an authoritarian leader\n\n12:34.500 --> 12:35.500\n in the country.\n\n12:35.500 --> 12:38.600\n It's by no means a majority.\n\n12:38.600 --> 12:44.060\n It's not even a plurality, but nonetheless, it's a real sentiment in the population.\n\n12:44.060 --> 12:48.660\n Sometimes because they feel frustrated because things are not getting done.\n\n12:48.660 --> 12:54.180\n Sometimes because they're against something that's happening in the political realm and\n\n12:54.180 --> 12:57.060\n they feel it has to be corrected and corrected quickly.\n\n12:57.060 --> 12:59.460\n It's a kind of impulse.\n\n12:59.460 --> 13:05.940\n People can regret the impulse later on, that the impulse is motivated by reaction to their\n\n13:05.940 --> 13:07.260\n environment.\n\n13:07.260 --> 13:13.020\n In the Russian case, we have also people who crave, sometimes known as a strong hand, an\n\n13:13.020 --> 13:18.580\n iron hand, an authoritarian leader, because they want things to be done and be done more\n\n13:18.580 --> 13:23.420\n quickly that align with their desires.\n\n13:23.420 --> 13:28.220\n But I'm not sure it's a majority in the country today.\n\n13:28.220 --> 13:34.880\n Certainly in Stalin's time, this was a widespread sentiment and people had few alternatives\n\n13:34.880 --> 13:37.620\n that they understood or could appeal to.\n\n13:37.620 --> 13:43.980\n Nowadays in the globalized world, the citizens of Russia can see how other systems have constraints\n\n13:43.980 --> 13:47.900\n on executive power and the life isn't so bad there.\n\n13:47.900 --> 13:50.780\n In fact, the life might even be better.\n\n13:50.780 --> 13:58.940\n So the impatience, the impulsive quality, the frustration does sometimes in people reinforce\n\n13:58.940 --> 14:05.580\n their craving for the unconstrained executive to quote, get things done or shake things\n\n14:05.580 --> 14:06.580\n up.\n\n14:06.580 --> 14:08.540\n Yes, that's true.\n\n14:08.540 --> 14:12.100\n But in the Russian case, I'm not sure it's cultural today.\n\n14:12.100 --> 14:20.700\n I think it might be more having to do with the failures, the functional failures of the\n\n14:20.700 --> 14:27.220\n kind of political system that they tried to institute after the Soviet collapse.\n\n14:27.220 --> 14:34.260\n And so it may be frustration with the version of constraints on executive power they got\n\n14:34.260 --> 14:43.580\n and how it didn't work the way it was imagined, which has led to a sense in which nonconstrained\n\n14:43.580 --> 14:45.820\n executive power could fix things.\n\n14:45.820 --> 14:51.040\n But I'm not sure that that's a majority sentiment in the Russian case, although it's hard to\n\n14:51.040 --> 15:00.100\n measure because under authoritarian regimes, a public opinion is shaped by the environment\n\n15:00.100 --> 15:04.820\n in which people live, which is very constrained in terms of public opinion.\n\n15:04.820 --> 15:11.740\n But on that point, why at least from a distance does there seem to nevertheless be support\n\n15:11.740 --> 15:15.860\n for the current Russian president Vladimir Putin?\n\n15:15.860 --> 15:23.060\n Is that have to do with the fact that measuring, getting good metrics and statistics on support\n\n15:23.060 --> 15:28.460\n is difficult in authoritarian governments, or is there still something appealing to that\n\n15:28.460 --> 15:30.660\n kind of power to the people?\n\n15:30.660 --> 15:36.740\n I think we have to give credit to President Putin for understanding the psychology of\n\n15:36.740 --> 15:41.880\n the Russians to whom he appeals.\n\n15:41.880 --> 15:46.340\n Many of them were the losers in the transition from communism.\n\n15:46.340 --> 15:52.280\n They were the ones whose pensions were destroyed by inflation or whose salaries didn't go up\n\n15:52.280 --> 15:55.420\n or whose regions were abandoned.\n\n15:55.420 --> 16:00.580\n They were not the winners for the most part, and so I think there's an understanding on\n\n16:00.580 --> 16:02.900\n his part of their psychology.\n\n16:02.900 --> 16:04.400\n Putin has grown in the position.\n\n16:04.400 --> 16:08.180\n He was not a public politician when he first started out.\n\n16:08.180 --> 16:10.900\n He was quite poor in public settings.\n\n16:10.900 --> 16:14.880\n He didn't have the kind of political instincts that he has now.\n\n16:14.880 --> 16:20.640\n He didn't have the appeal to traditional values and the Orthodox Church and some of the other\n\n16:20.640 --> 16:24.100\n dimensions of his rule today.\n\n16:24.100 --> 16:31.820\n So yes, we have to give some credit to Putin himself for this in addition to the frustrations\n\n16:31.820 --> 16:34.220\n and the mass of the people.\n\n16:34.220 --> 16:39.220\n But let's think about it this way in addition, without taking away the fact that he's become\n\n16:39.220 --> 16:46.720\n a better retail politician over time and that sentiment has shifted because of the disappointments\n\n16:46.720 --> 16:51.500\n with the transition with the population.\n\n16:51.500 --> 16:57.020\n When I ask my kids, am I a good dad?\n\n16:57.020 --> 17:01.980\n My kids don't have any other dad to measure me against.\n\n17:01.980 --> 17:08.700\n I'm the only dad they know, and I'm the only dad they can choose or not choose.\n\n17:08.700 --> 17:13.180\n If they don't choose me, they still get me as dad, right?\n\n17:13.180 --> 17:18.860\n So with Putin today, he's the only dad that the Russian people have.\n\n17:18.860 --> 17:24.600\n Now, if my kids were introduced to alternative fathers, they might be better than me.\n\n17:24.600 --> 17:32.100\n They might be more loving, more giving, funnier, richer, whatever it might be.\n\n17:32.100 --> 17:34.300\n They might be more appealing.\n\n17:34.300 --> 17:39.260\n There are some blood ties there for sure that I have with my kids, but they would at least\n\n17:39.260 --> 17:47.260\n be able to choose alternatives and then I would have to win their favor in that constellation\n\n17:47.260 --> 17:48.800\n of alternatives.\n\n17:48.800 --> 17:55.420\n If President Putin were up against real alternatives, if the population had real choice and that\n\n17:55.420 --> 18:01.220\n choice could express itself and have resources and have media and everything else the way\n\n18:01.220 --> 18:08.460\n he does, maybe he would be very popular and maybe his popularity would not be as great\n\n18:08.460 --> 18:10.540\n as it currently is.\n\n18:10.540 --> 18:18.780\n So the absence of alternatives is another factor that reinforces his authority and his\n\n18:18.780 --> 18:19.780\n popularity.\n\n18:19.780 --> 18:25.340\n Having said that, there are many authoritarian leaders who deny any alternatives to the\n\n18:25.340 --> 18:29.260\n population and are not very popular.\n\n18:29.260 --> 18:33.760\n So denial of alternatives doesn't guarantee you the popularity.\n\n18:33.760 --> 18:39.180\n You still have to figure out the mass psychology and be able to appeal to it.\n\n18:39.180 --> 18:49.540\n So in the Russian case, the winners from the transition live primarily in the big cities\n\n18:49.540 --> 18:56.780\n and are self employed or entrepreneurial.\n\n18:56.780 --> 19:00.940\n Even if they're not self employed, they're able to change careers.\n\n19:00.940 --> 19:08.980\n They have tremendous skills and talent and education and knowledge as well as these entrepreneurial\n\n19:08.980 --> 19:12.140\n or dynamic personalities.\n\n19:12.140 --> 19:13.900\n Putin also appealed to them.\n\n19:13.900 --> 19:18.820\n He did that with Medvedev and it was a very clever ruse.\n\n19:18.820 --> 19:27.300\n He himself appealed to the losers from the transition, the small towns, the rural, the\n\n19:27.300 --> 19:32.740\n people who were not well off and he had them for the most part.\n\n19:32.740 --> 19:33.740\n Not all.\n\n19:33.740 --> 19:36.840\n We don't want to generalize to say that he had every one of them because those people\n\n19:36.840 --> 19:42.380\n have views of their own, sometimes in contradiction with the president of Russia.\n\n19:42.380 --> 19:47.800\n And then he appealed to the opposite people, the successful urban base through the so called\n\n19:47.800 --> 19:54.980\n reformer Medvedev, the new generation, the technically literate prime minister who for\n\n19:54.980 --> 19:56.940\n a time was president.\n\n19:56.940 --> 19:59.220\n And so that worked very successfully for Putin.\n\n19:59.220 --> 20:07.100\n He was able to bridge a big divide in the society and gain a greater mass support than\n\n20:07.100 --> 20:09.260\n he would otherwise have had by himself.\n\n20:09.260 --> 20:17.780\n That ruse only worked through the time that Medvedev was temporarily president for a few\n\n20:17.780 --> 20:25.100\n years because of the Constitution, Putin couldn't do three consecutive terms and stepped aside\n\n20:25.100 --> 20:30.540\n in what they call castling in chess.\n\n20:30.540 --> 20:35.300\n When this was over, Putin had difficulty with his popularity.\n\n20:35.300 --> 20:41.620\n There were mass protests in the urban areas, precisely that group of the population that\n\n20:41.620 --> 20:48.980\n he had been able to win in part because of the Medvedev castling and now had had their\n\n20:48.980 --> 20:55.620\n delusions exposed and were disillusioned, and there were these mass protests in the\n\n20:55.620 --> 20:59.060\n urban areas, not just in the capital, by the way.\n\n20:59.060 --> 21:03.820\n And Putin had to, as it were, come up with a new way to fix his popularity, which happened\n\n21:03.820 --> 21:10.420\n to be the annexation of Crimea, from which he got a very significant bump.\n\n21:10.420 --> 21:15.500\n However, the trend is back in the other direction.\n\n21:15.500 --> 21:21.380\n It's diminishing again, although it's still high relative to other leaders around the\n\n21:21.380 --> 21:22.380\n world.\n\n21:22.380 --> 21:28.300\n So I wouldn't say that he's unpopular with the mass in Russia.\n\n21:28.300 --> 21:32.980\n There is some popularity there, there is some success, but I would say it's tough for us\n\n21:32.980 --> 21:36.580\n to gauge because of the lack of alternatives.\n\n21:36.580 --> 21:42.340\n And Putin is unpopular inside the state administration.\n\n21:42.340 --> 21:45.500\n At every level, the bureaucracy of the leadership.\n\n21:45.500 --> 21:51.260\n Because those people are well informed, and they understand that the country is declining,\n\n21:51.260 --> 21:57.180\n that the human capital is declining, the infrastructure is declining, the economy is not really growing,\n\n21:57.180 --> 22:02.060\n it's not really diversifying, Russia's not investing in its future.\n\n22:02.060 --> 22:07.860\n The state officials understand all of that, and then they see that the Putin clique is\n\n22:07.860 --> 22:10.260\n stealing everything in sight.\n\n22:10.260 --> 22:16.820\n So between the failure to invest in a future and the corruption of a narrow group around\n\n22:16.820 --> 22:22.380\n the president, there's disillusionment in the state apparatus because they see this\n\n22:22.380 --> 22:27.420\n more clearly or more closely than the mass of the population.\n\n22:27.420 --> 22:38.020\n They can't necessarily yet oppose this in public because they're people, they have families,\n\n22:38.020 --> 22:43.020\n they have careers, they have children who want to go to school or want a job.\n\n22:43.020 --> 22:49.220\n And so there are constraints on their ability to oppose the regime based upon what we might\n\n22:49.220 --> 22:52.580\n call cowardice or other people might call realism.\n\n22:52.580 --> 22:59.980\n I don't know how courageous people can be when their family, children, career are on\n\n22:59.980 --> 23:01.960\n the line.\n\n23:01.960 --> 23:06.420\n So it's very interesting dynamic to see the disillusionment inside the government with\n\n23:06.420 --> 23:13.140\n the president, which is not yet fully public for the most part, but could become public.\n\n23:13.140 --> 23:17.500\n And once again, if there's an alternative, if an alternative appears, things could shift\n\n23:17.500 --> 23:18.580\n quickly.\n\n23:18.580 --> 23:22.220\n And that alternative could come from inside the regime.\n\n23:22.220 --> 23:23.220\n From inside the regime.\n\n23:23.220 --> 23:29.540\n But the leadership, the party, the people that are now, as you're saying, opposed to\n\n23:29.540 --> 23:37.420\n Putin, nevertheless, maybe you can correct me, but it feels like there's, structurally\n\n23:37.420 --> 23:39.260\n is deeply corrupt.\n\n23:39.260 --> 23:47.780\n So each of the people we're talking about are, don't feel like a George Washington.\n\n23:47.780 --> 23:53.060\n Once again, the circumstances don't permit them to act that way necessarily, right?\n\n23:53.060 --> 23:57.660\n George Washington did great things, but in certain circumstances.\n\n23:57.660 --> 24:03.220\n A lot of the state officials in Russia for certain are corrupt.\n\n24:03.220 --> 24:04.780\n There's no question.\n\n24:04.780 --> 24:12.540\n Many of them, however, are patriotic and many of them feel badly about where the country\n\n24:12.540 --> 24:14.300\n has been going.\n\n24:14.300 --> 24:17.180\n They would prefer that the country was less corrupt.\n\n24:17.180 --> 24:24.240\n They would prefer that there were greater investment in all sorts of areas of Russia.\n\n24:24.240 --> 24:30.400\n They might even themselves steal less if they could be guaranteed that everybody else would\n\n24:30.400 --> 24:32.140\n steal less.\n\n24:32.140 --> 24:40.540\n There's a deep and abiding patriotism inside Russia, as well as inside the Russian regime.\n\n24:40.540 --> 24:46.060\n So they understand that Putin in many ways rescued the Russian state from the chaos of\n\n24:46.060 --> 24:47.900\n the 1990s.\n\n24:47.900 --> 24:55.780\n They understand that Russia was in very bad shape as an incoherent failing state almost\n\n24:55.780 --> 25:03.260\n when Putin took over and that he did some important things for Russia's stability and\n\n25:03.260 --> 25:05.540\n consolidation.\n\n25:05.540 --> 25:12.940\n There's also some appreciation that Putin stood up to the West and stood up to more\n\n25:12.940 --> 25:19.380\n powerful countries and regained a sense of pride and maneuverability for Russia in the\n\n25:19.380 --> 25:21.520\n international system.\n\n25:21.520 --> 25:23.760\n People appreciate that and it's real.\n\n25:23.760 --> 25:27.700\n It's not imagined that Putin accomplished that.\n\n25:27.700 --> 25:32.020\n The problem is the methods that he accomplished it with.\n\n25:32.020 --> 25:37.700\n He used the kind of methods, that is to say, taking other people's property, putting other\n\n25:37.700 --> 25:40.740\n people in jail for political reasons.\n\n25:40.740 --> 25:46.160\n He used the kind of methods that are not conducive to long term growth and stability.\n\n25:46.160 --> 25:50.960\n So he fixed the problem, but he fixed the problem and then created even bigger long\n\n25:50.960 --> 25:53.500\n term problems potentially.\n\n25:53.500 --> 26:00.300\n And moreover, all authoritarian regimes that use those methods are tempted to keep using\n\n26:00.300 --> 26:05.980\n them and using them and using them until they're the only ones who are the beneficiaries and\n\n26:05.980 --> 26:08.360\n the group narrows and narrows.\n\n26:08.360 --> 26:11.500\n The elite gets smaller and narrower.\n\n26:11.500 --> 26:18.940\n The interest groups get excluded from power and their ability to continue enjoying the\n\n26:18.940 --> 26:22.600\n fruits of the system and the resentment grows.\n\n26:22.600 --> 26:28.060\n And so that's the situation we have in Russia is a place that is stuck.\n\n26:28.060 --> 26:31.900\n It was to a certain extent rescued.\n\n26:31.900 --> 26:37.900\n It was rescued with methods that were not conducive to long term success and stability.\n\n26:37.900 --> 26:43.100\n The rescue you're referring to is the sort of the economic growth when Putin first took\n\n26:43.100 --> 26:44.100\n office.\n\n26:44.100 --> 26:45.100\n Yes, they had 10 years.\n\n26:45.100 --> 26:50.460\n They had a full decade of an average of 7% growth a year, which was phenomenal and is\n\n26:50.460 --> 26:55.220\n not attributable predominantly to oil prices.\n\n26:55.220 --> 27:03.180\n During President Putin's first term as president, the average price of oil was $35 a barrel.\n\n27:03.180 --> 27:08.660\n During his second term as president, the average price was $70 a barrel.\n\n27:08.660 --> 27:16.540\n So during those two terms, when Russia was growing at about 7% a year, oil prices were\n\n27:16.540 --> 27:24.180\n averaging somewhere around $50 a barrel, which is fine, but is not the reason because later\n\n27:24.180 --> 27:30.920\n on when oil prices were over $100 a barrel, Russia stagnated.\n\n27:30.920 --> 27:34.220\n So the initial growth, do you think Putin deserves some credit for that?\n\n27:34.220 --> 27:40.280\n Yes, he does because he introduced some important liberalizing measures.\n\n27:40.280 --> 27:42.220\n He lowered taxes.\n\n27:42.220 --> 27:45.960\n He allowed land to be bought and sold.\n\n27:45.960 --> 27:50.340\n He deregulated many areas of the economy.\n\n27:50.340 --> 27:57.700\n And so there was a kind of entrepreneurial burst that was partly attributable, partly\n\n27:57.700 --> 28:01.900\n attributable to government policy during his first term.\n\n28:01.900 --> 28:05.240\n But also he was consolidating political power.\n\n28:05.240 --> 28:12.480\n And as I said, the methods he used overall for the long term were not able to continue\n\n28:12.480 --> 28:14.980\n sustain that success.\n\n28:14.980 --> 28:21.200\n In addition, we have to remember that China played a really big role in the success of\n\n28:21.200 --> 28:30.540\n Russia in the first two terms of Putin's presidency because China's phenomenal growth created\n\n28:30.540 --> 28:37.300\n insatiable demand for just about everything that the Soviet Union used to produce.\n\n28:37.300 --> 28:46.660\n So fertilizers, cement, fill in the blank, chemicals, metals, China had insatiable demand\n\n28:46.660 --> 28:50.260\n for everything the Soviet Union once produced.\n\n28:50.260 --> 29:00.480\n And so China's raising of global demand overall brought Soviet era industry back from the\n\n29:00.480 --> 29:02.240\n dead.\n\n29:02.240 --> 29:04.880\n And so there was something that happened.\n\n29:04.880 --> 29:09.000\n Soviet era industry fell off a cliff in the 1990s.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:14.780\n There was a decline in manufacturing and industrial production greater than in the Great Depression\n\n29:14.780 --> 29:16.940\n in the US.\n\n29:16.940 --> 29:21.220\n But a lot of that came back online in the 2000s.\n\n29:21.220 --> 29:23.980\n And that had to do with China's phenomenal growth.\n\n29:23.980 --> 29:28.380\n The trade between China and Russia was not always direct.\n\n29:28.380 --> 29:30.700\n So this was an indirect effect.\n\n29:30.700 --> 29:38.100\n But raising global prices for the commodities and the products, the kind of lower end, lower\n\n29:38.100 --> 29:45.020\n value products in manufacturing, not high end stuff, but lower end stuff like steel\n\n29:45.020 --> 29:53.700\n or iron or cement or fertilizer, where the value added is not spectacular, but nonetheless,\n\n29:53.700 --> 29:59.340\n which had been destroyed by the 1990s and after the Soviet collapse, this was brought\n\n29:59.340 --> 30:00.340\n back to life.\n\n30:00.340 --> 30:02.580\n Now, you can do that once.\n\n30:02.580 --> 30:06.660\n You can bring Soviet era industry back to life once.\n\n30:06.660 --> 30:12.540\n And that happened during Putin's first two terms, in addition to the liberalizing policies,\n\n30:12.540 --> 30:17.000\n which spurred entrepreneurialism in some small and medium business.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:24.220\n The crash of the ruble in 1998, which made Russian products much cheaper abroad and made\n\n30:24.220 --> 30:31.380\n imports much more expensive, also facilitated the resuscitation, the revival of domestic\n\n30:31.380 --> 30:33.540\n manufacturing.\n\n30:33.540 --> 30:43.180\n So all of this came together for that spectacular 10 year, 7% on average economic growth.\n\n30:43.180 --> 30:51.020\n And moreover, people's wages after inflation, their disposable income grew more even than\n\n30:51.020 --> 30:52.620\n GDP grew.\n\n30:52.620 --> 30:59.140\n So disposable income after inflation, that is real income, was growing greater than 7%.\n\n30:59.140 --> 31:01.860\n In some cases, 10% a year.\n\n31:01.860 --> 31:06.920\n So there was a boom, and the Russian people felt it, and it happened during Putin's first\n\n31:06.920 --> 31:12.940\n two terms, and people were grateful, rightly so, for that.\n\n31:12.940 --> 31:19.820\n And those who don't want to give Putin credit, give oil prices all the credit.\n\n31:19.820 --> 31:23.700\n But I don't think that oil prices can explain this.\n\n31:23.700 --> 31:29.540\n Having said that, that doesn't mean that this was sustainable over the long term.\n\n31:29.540 --> 31:35.940\n So you've briefly mentioned, sort of implying the possibility, you know, Stalin held power\n\n31:35.940 --> 31:38.640\n for, let's say, 30 years.\n\n31:38.640 --> 31:45.300\n You briefly mentioned that as a question, will Putin be able to beat that record, to\n\n31:45.300 --> 31:46.300\n beat that?\n\n31:46.300 --> 31:52.700\n So can you talk about your sense of, is it possible that Putin holds power for that kind\n\n31:52.700 --> 31:54.200\n of duration?\n\n31:54.200 --> 31:55.900\n Let's hope not.\n\n31:55.900 --> 31:59.540\n Let's hope not for Russia's sake.\n\n31:59.540 --> 32:05.420\n The primary victims of President Putin's power are Russians.\n\n32:05.420 --> 32:11.180\n They're not Ukrainians, although to a certain extent, Ukraine has suffered because of Putin's\n\n32:11.180 --> 32:12.180\n actions.\n\n32:12.180 --> 32:15.700\n And they're not Americans, they're Russians.\n\n32:15.700 --> 32:20.660\n Moreover, Russia has lost a great deal of human talent.\n\n32:20.660 --> 32:27.340\n Tens of millions of people have left Russia since 1991 overall.\n\n32:27.340 --> 32:33.320\n Somewhere between five and 10 million people have left the country and are beyond the borders\n\n32:33.320 --> 32:35.660\n of the former Soviet Union.\n\n32:35.660 --> 32:38.260\n So they left the Soviet space entirely.\n\n32:38.260 --> 32:41.860\n Moreover, the people who left are not the poor people.\n\n32:41.860 --> 32:44.320\n They're not the uneducated.\n\n32:44.320 --> 32:45.780\n They're not the losers.\n\n32:45.780 --> 32:50.100\n The people who've left are the more dynamic parts of the population.\n\n32:50.100 --> 32:53.120\n The better educated, the more entrepreneurial.\n\n32:53.120 --> 32:58.440\n So that human capital loss that Russia has suffered is phenomenal.\n\n32:58.440 --> 33:04.560\n And in fact, right here where we're sitting at MIT, we have examples of people who are\n\n33:04.560 --> 33:10.380\n qualified good enough for MIT and have left Russia to come to MIT.\n\n33:10.380 --> 33:12.200\n You're looking at one of them.\n\n33:12.200 --> 33:19.980\n And the other aspect, just to quickly comment, is those same people like me, I'm not welcome\n\n33:19.980 --> 33:20.980\n back.\n\n33:20.980 --> 33:22.420\n No, you're not under the current regime.\n\n33:22.420 --> 33:28.860\n It was a big loss for Russia if you're patriotic, but not from the point of view of the Putin\n\n33:28.860 --> 33:29.860\n regime.\n\n33:29.860 --> 33:33.660\n That has to do, also factors into popularity.\n\n33:33.660 --> 33:39.620\n If the people who don't like you leave, they're not there to complain, to protest, to vote\n\n33:39.620 --> 33:41.160\n against you.\n\n33:41.160 --> 33:46.300\n And so your opposition declines when you let them leave.\n\n33:46.300 --> 33:49.180\n However, it's very costly in human capital terms.\n\n33:49.180 --> 33:55.060\n Hemorrhaging that much human capital is damaging, it's self damaging.\n\n33:55.060 --> 33:57.040\n And we've seen it accelerate.\n\n33:57.040 --> 34:04.740\n It was already high, but we've seen it accelerate in the last seven to eight years of President\n\n34:04.740 --> 34:07.340\n Putin's rule.\n\n34:07.340 --> 34:11.940\n And those people are not going back of their own volition.\n\n34:11.940 --> 34:15.840\n But even if they wanted to go back, as you just said, they'd be unwelcome.\n\n34:15.840 --> 34:19.180\n That's a big cost to pay for this regime.\n\n34:19.180 --> 34:25.100\n And so whatever benefits this regime might or might not have given to the country, the\n\n34:25.100 --> 34:30.280\n disadvantages, the downside, the costs are also really high.\n\n34:30.280 --> 34:34.540\n So we don't want Putin lasting in power as long as Stalin.\n\n34:34.540 --> 34:40.520\n It would be better if Russia were able to choose among options, to choose a new leader\n\n34:40.520 --> 34:42.940\n among options.\n\n34:42.940 --> 34:48.300\n Many people speculate that President Putin will name a successor the way Yeltsin named\n\n34:48.300 --> 34:52.720\n Putin as his successor, President Boris Yeltsin.\n\n34:52.720 --> 34:58.500\n And then Putin will leave the stage and allow the successor to take over.\n\n34:58.500 --> 35:05.100\n That might seem like a good solution, but once again, we don't need a system where you\n\n35:05.100 --> 35:09.700\n hang on for as long as possible and then nominate who's going to take over.\n\n35:09.700 --> 35:17.820\n We need a system that has the kind of corrective mechanisms that democracies and markets have\n\n35:17.820 --> 35:19.580\n along with rule of law.\n\n35:19.580 --> 35:25.620\n A corrective mechanism is really important because all leaders make mistakes.\n\n35:25.620 --> 35:32.060\n But when you can't correct for the mistakes, then the mistakes get compounded.\n\n35:32.060 --> 35:38.340\n Putin could well, he seems to be healthy, he could well last as many years as Stalin.\n\n35:38.340 --> 35:44.860\n It's hard to predict because events intercede sometimes and create circumstances that are\n\n35:44.860 --> 35:51.660\n unforeseen and leaders get overthrown or have a heart attack or whatever.\n\n35:51.660 --> 35:59.140\n There's a palace insurrection where ambitious leaders on the inside for both personal power\n\n35:59.140 --> 36:04.020\n and patriotic reasons try to push aside an aging leader.\n\n36:04.020 --> 36:09.820\n There are many scenarios in which Putin could not last that long, but unfortunately, right\n\n36:09.820 --> 36:16.460\n now, you could also imagine potentially him lasting that long, which as I said, is not\n\n36:16.460 --> 36:21.740\n an outcome if you're patriotic about Russia, it's not an outcome you would wish out to\n\n36:21.740 --> 36:22.740\n the country.\n\n36:22.740 --> 36:29.380\n It's, I guess, a very difficult question, but what practically do you feel is a way\n\n36:29.380 --> 36:38.860\n out of the Putin regime, is a way out of the corruption that's deeply underlies the state?\n\n36:38.860 --> 36:44.300\n Is a, if you look from a history perspective, is a revolution required?\n\n36:44.300 --> 36:47.700\n Is violence required?\n\n36:47.700 --> 36:54.060\n Is from violence within or external to the country?\n\n36:54.060 --> 37:05.380\n Do you see, or is a powerful, is a inspiring leader enough to step in and bring democracy\n\n37:05.380 --> 37:09.140\n and kind of the free world to Russia?\n\n37:09.140 --> 37:11.180\n So Russia is not a failed country.\n\n37:11.180 --> 37:17.780\n It's a middle income country with tremendous potential and has proven many times in the\n\n37:17.780 --> 37:24.700\n past that when it gets in a bad way, it can reverse its trajectory.\n\n37:24.700 --> 37:29.340\n Moreover, violence is rarely ever a solution.\n\n37:29.340 --> 37:35.300\n Violence rarely, it may break an existing trend, but it's rare that violence produces\n\n37:35.300 --> 37:38.840\n a nonviolent, sustainable, positive outcome.\n\n37:38.840 --> 37:42.900\n It happens, but it doesn't happen frequently.\n\n37:42.900 --> 37:53.540\n Mental upheaval is not a way always to institutionalize a better path forward because you need institutions.\n\n37:53.540 --> 37:59.140\n People can protest as they did throughout the Middle East, and the protests didn't necessarily\n\n37:59.140 --> 38:08.380\n lead to better systems because the step from protest to new, strong, consolidated institutions\n\n38:08.380 --> 38:11.900\n is a colossal leap, not a small step.\n\n38:11.900 --> 38:18.300\n What we need and what we see from history and situations like this is a group within\n\n38:18.300 --> 38:25.280\n the power structures, which is a patriotic that sees things going down.\n\n38:25.280 --> 38:31.360\n That is to say that sees things not being developing relative to neighbors, relative\n\n38:31.360 --> 38:38.640\n to richer countries, relative to more successful countries, and they want to change the trajectory\n\n38:38.640 --> 38:40.460\n of Russia.\n\n38:40.460 --> 38:49.420\n And if they can, in a coalition fashion, unseat the current regime for a new power sharing\n\n38:49.420 --> 38:56.180\n arrangement, which once again can be frustrating because you can't do changes immediately,\n\n38:56.180 --> 39:00.460\n you can't do things overnight, but that's the point.\n\n39:00.460 --> 39:04.860\n Constraints on your ability to change everything immediately and to force change overnight\n\n39:04.860 --> 39:08.900\n is what leads to long term success potentially.\n\n39:08.900 --> 39:12.120\n That's the sustainability of change.\n\n39:12.120 --> 39:14.940\n So Russia needs stronger institutions.\n\n39:14.940 --> 39:20.500\n It needs court system as well as democratic institutions.\n\n39:20.500 --> 39:26.340\n It needs functioning, open, dynamic markets rather than monopolies.\n\n39:26.340 --> 39:33.580\n It needs meritocracy and banks to award loans on the basis of business plans, not on the\n\n39:33.580 --> 39:39.960\n basis of political criteria or corrupt bribery or whatever it might be.\n\n39:39.960 --> 39:47.340\n So Russia needs those kind of functioning institutions that take time, are sometimes\n\n39:47.340 --> 39:55.140\n slow, don't lead to a revolutionary transformation, but lead to potentially long term sustainable\n\n39:55.140 --> 40:01.340\n growth without upheaval, without violence, without getting into a situation where all\n\n40:01.340 --> 40:04.700\n of a sudden you need a miracle again.\n\n40:04.700 --> 40:11.780\n Every time Russia seems to need a miracle, and that's the problem, the solution would\n\n40:11.780 --> 40:14.380\n be not needing a miracle.\n\n40:14.380 --> 40:17.940\n Now having said that, the potential is there.\n\n40:17.940 --> 40:22.400\n The civilization that we call Russia is amazingly impressive.\n\n40:22.400 --> 40:28.360\n It has delivered world class culture, world class science.\n\n40:28.360 --> 40:30.100\n It's a great power.\n\n40:30.100 --> 40:34.700\n It's not a great power with a strong base right now, but nonetheless it is a great power\n\n40:34.700 --> 40:36.580\n as it acts in the world.\n\n40:36.580 --> 40:41.660\n So I wouldn't underestimate Russia's abilities here and I wouldn't write off Russia.\n\n40:41.660 --> 40:46.580\n I don't see it under the current regime, a renewal of the country.\n\n40:46.580 --> 40:52.920\n But if we can have from within the regime an evolution rather than a revolution in a\n\n40:52.920 --> 41:00.420\n positive direction, and maybe get a George Washington figure who is strong enough to\n\n41:00.420 --> 41:06.200\n push through institutionalization rather than personalism.\n\n41:06.200 --> 41:12.100\n So if I could ask about one particular individual, it'd be just interesting to get your comment,\n\n41:12.100 --> 41:16.100\n but also as a representative of potential leaders, I just on this podcast talked to\n\n41:16.100 --> 41:23.300\n Gary Kasparov, who I'm not sure if you're familiar with his, his ongoings.\n\n41:23.300 --> 41:28.700\n So besides being a world class chess player, he's also a very outspoken activist, sort\n\n41:28.700 --> 41:38.740\n of seeing Putin, truly seeing Putin as an enemy of the free world of democracy, of balanced\n\n41:38.740 --> 41:40.240\n government in Russia.\n\n41:40.240 --> 41:47.460\n What do you think of people like him specifically, or just people like him trying as leaders\n\n41:47.460 --> 41:55.320\n to step in, to run for president, to symbolize a new chapter in Russia's future?\n\n41:55.320 --> 41:58.100\n So we don't need individuals.\n\n41:58.100 --> 42:04.180\n Some individuals are very impressive and they have courage and they protest and they criticize\n\n42:04.180 --> 42:07.060\n and they organize.\n\n42:07.060 --> 42:08.900\n We need institutions.\n\n42:08.900 --> 42:12.380\n We need a Duma or a parliament that functions.\n\n42:12.380 --> 42:15.320\n We need a court system that functions.\n\n42:15.320 --> 42:24.100\n That is to say where there are a separation of powers, impartial professional civil service,\n\n42:24.100 --> 42:28.140\n impartial professional judiciary.\n\n42:28.140 --> 42:30.480\n Those are the things Russia needs.\n\n42:30.480 --> 42:35.260\n It's rare that you get that from an individual, no matter how impressive, right?\n\n42:35.260 --> 42:43.100\n We had Andrei Sakharov, who was an extraordinary individual, who developed the hydrogen bomb\n\n42:43.100 --> 42:53.620\n under a Soviet regime, was a world class physicist, was then upset about how his scientific knowledge\n\n42:53.620 --> 43:01.580\n and scientific achievements were being put to use and rebelled to try to put limits,\n\n43:01.580 --> 43:08.380\n constraints, civilizing humane limits and constraints on some of the implications of\n\n43:08.380 --> 43:10.820\n his extraordinary science.\n\n43:10.820 --> 43:16.660\n But Sakharov, even if he had become the leader of the country, which he did not become, he\n\n43:16.660 --> 43:22.640\n was more of a moral or spiritual leader, it still wouldn't have given you a judiciary.\n\n43:22.640 --> 43:25.200\n It still wouldn't have given you a civil service.\n\n43:25.200 --> 43:29.140\n It still wouldn't have given you a Duma or functioning parliament.\n\n43:29.140 --> 43:32.820\n You need a leader in coalition with other leaders.\n\n43:32.820 --> 43:39.000\n You need a bunch of leaders, a whole group, and they have to be divided a little bit so\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:42.580\n that not one of them can destroy all the others.\n\n43:42.580 --> 43:50.000\n And they have to be interested in creating institutions, not solely or predominantly\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.240\n in their personal power.\n\n43:52.240 --> 43:58.700\n And so I have no objection to outstanding individuals and to the work that they do.\n\n43:58.700 --> 44:04.180\n But I think in institutional terms, and they need to think that way too in order to be\n\n44:04.180 --> 44:05.180\n successful.\n\n44:05.180 --> 44:11.260\n So if we go back to the echoes of that after the Russian Revolution with Stalin, with Lenin\n\n44:11.260 --> 44:18.580\n and Stalin, maybe you can correct me, but there was a group of people there in that\n\n44:18.580 --> 44:30.820\n same kind of way looking to establish institutions that were beautifully built around an ideology\n\n44:30.820 --> 44:34.580\n that they believed is good for the world.\n\n44:34.580 --> 44:41.260\n So sort of echoing that idea of what we're talking about, what Russia needs now, can\n\n44:41.260 --> 44:48.880\n you, first of all, you've described a fascinating thought, which is Stalin is having amassed\n\n44:48.880 --> 44:54.500\n arguably more power than any man in history, which is an interesting thing to think about.\n\n44:54.500 --> 45:00.620\n But can you tell about his journey to getting that power after the Russian Revolution?\n\n45:00.620 --> 45:08.740\n How does that perhaps echo to our current discussion about institutions and so on?\n\n45:08.740 --> 45:14.560\n And just in general, the story I think is fascinating of how one man is able to get\n\n45:14.560 --> 45:17.220\n more power than any other man in history.\n\n45:17.220 --> 45:24.080\n It is a great story, not necessarily from a moral point of view, but if you're interested\n\n45:24.080 --> 45:27.620\n in power, for sure it's an incredible story.\n\n45:27.620 --> 45:34.260\n So we have to remember that Stalin is also a product of circumstances, not solely his\n\n45:34.260 --> 45:38.760\n own individual drive, which is very strong.\n\n45:38.760 --> 45:46.020\n For example, World War I breaks the czarist regime, the czarist order, imperial Russian\n\n45:46.020 --> 45:47.620\n state.\n\n45:47.620 --> 45:51.740\n Stalin has no participation whatsoever in World War I.\n\n45:51.740 --> 45:56.220\n He spends World War I in exile in Siberia.\n\n45:56.220 --> 46:06.020\n Until the downfall of the czarist autocracy in February 1917, Stalin is in Eastern Siberian\n\n46:06.020 --> 46:07.460\n exile.\n\n46:07.460 --> 46:12.440\n He's only able to leave Eastern Siberia when that regime falls.\n\n46:12.440 --> 46:15.140\n He never fights in the war.\n\n46:15.140 --> 46:21.420\n He's called up briefly towards the end of the war and is disqualified on physical grounds\n\n46:21.420 --> 46:25.880\n because of physical deformities from being drafted.\n\n46:25.880 --> 46:32.860\n The war continues after the czarist regime has been toppled in the capital and there's\n\n46:32.860 --> 46:35.520\n been a revolution.\n\n46:35.520 --> 46:40.700\n The war continues and that war is very radicalizing.\n\n46:40.700 --> 46:47.100\n The peasants begin to seize the land after the czar falls, essentially destroying much\n\n46:47.100 --> 46:49.180\n of the gentry class.\n\n46:49.180 --> 46:50.540\n Stalin has nothing to do with that.\n\n46:50.540 --> 46:57.660\n The peasants have their own revolution, seizing the land, not in law, but in fact, de facto\n\n46:57.660 --> 47:00.160\n not de jure land ownership.\n\n47:00.160 --> 47:08.420\n So there are these really large processes underway that Stalin is alive during, but\n\n47:08.420 --> 47:10.980\n not a driver of.\n\n47:10.980 --> 47:17.340\n The most improbable thing happens, which is a very small group of people around the figure\n\n47:17.340 --> 47:23.620\n of Vladimir Lenin announces that it has seized power.\n\n47:23.620 --> 47:30.660\n Now by this time in October 1917, the government that has replaced the czar, the so called\n\n47:30.660 --> 47:34.220\n provisional government, has failed.\n\n47:34.220 --> 47:39.280\n And so there's not so much power to seize from the provisional government.\n\n47:39.280 --> 47:43.220\n What Lenin does is he does a coup on the left.\n\n47:43.220 --> 47:51.020\n That is to say, Soviets or councils, as we would call them in English, which represent\n\n47:51.020 --> 47:56.120\n people's power or the masses participating in politics, a kind of radical grassroots\n\n47:56.120 --> 48:04.140\n democracy are extremely popular all over the country and not dominated by any one group,\n\n48:04.140 --> 48:09.500\n but predominantly socialist or predominantly leftist.\n\n48:09.500 --> 48:16.180\n Russia has an election during the war, a free and fair election for the most part, despite\n\n48:16.180 --> 48:24.700\n the war at the end of 1917, in December 1917, and three quarters plus of the country votes\n\n48:24.700 --> 48:27.980\n socialist in some form or another.\n\n48:27.980 --> 48:34.460\n So the battle was over the definition of socialism and who had the right to participate in defining\n\n48:34.460 --> 48:39.460\n socialism, not only what it would be, but who had the right to decide.\n\n48:39.460 --> 48:47.400\n So there's a coup by Lenin's group known as the Bolsheviks against all the other socialists.\n\n48:47.400 --> 48:54.780\n And so Lenin declares a seizure of power whereby the old government has failed, people's power,\n\n48:54.780 --> 49:01.420\n the councils known as the Soviets are going to take their place, and Lenin seizes power\n\n49:01.420 --> 49:03.540\n in the name of the Soviets.\n\n49:03.540 --> 49:09.340\n So it's a coup against the left, against the rest of the left, not against the provisional\n\n49:09.340 --> 49:13.220\n government that has replaced the czar, which has already failed.\n\n49:13.220 --> 49:21.700\n And so Stalin is able to come to power along with Lenin in this crazy seizure of power\n\n49:21.700 --> 49:27.360\n on the left against the rest of the left in October 1917, which we know is the October\n\n49:27.360 --> 49:35.020\n Revolution, and I call the October coup as many other historians call.\n\n49:35.020 --> 49:38.740\n The October Revolution happened after the seizure of power.\n\n49:38.740 --> 49:44.500\n What's interesting about this episode is that the leftists who seize power in the name of\n\n49:44.500 --> 49:49.860\n the Soviets, in the name of the masses, in the name of people's power, they retain their\n\n49:49.860 --> 49:51.560\n hold.\n\n49:51.560 --> 49:56.760\n Many times in history, there's a seizure of power by the left, and they fail.\n\n49:56.760 --> 49:58.260\n They collapse.\n\n49:58.260 --> 50:03.580\n They're cleaned out by an army or what we call forces of order, by counter revolutionary\n\n50:03.580 --> 50:04.980\n forces.\n\n50:04.980 --> 50:09.020\n Lenin's revolution, Lenin's coup is successful.\n\n50:09.020 --> 50:12.660\n It is able to hold power, not just seize power.\n\n50:12.660 --> 50:21.780\n They win a civil war, and they're entrenched in the heart of the country already by 1921.\n\n50:21.780 --> 50:23.940\n Stalin is part of that group.\n\n50:23.940 --> 50:26.660\n Lenin needs somebody to run.\n\n50:26.660 --> 50:32.580\n This new regime in the kind of nitty gritty way, Lenin is the leader, the undisputed leader\n\n50:32.580 --> 50:38.260\n in the Bolshevik party, which changes their name to communists in 1918.\n\n50:38.260 --> 50:45.620\n He makes Stalin the general secretary of the communist party.\n\n50:45.620 --> 50:52.900\n He creates a new position, which hadn't existed before, a kind of day to day political manager,\n\n50:52.900 --> 50:54.980\n a right hand man.\n\n50:54.980 --> 50:57.660\n Not because Lenin is looking to replace himself.\n\n50:57.660 --> 51:02.340\n He's looking to institutionalize a helpmate, a right hand man.\n\n51:02.340 --> 51:08.060\n He does this in the spring of 1922.\n\n51:08.060 --> 51:12.600\n Stalin is named to this position, which Lenin has created expressly for Stalin.\n\n51:12.600 --> 51:19.060\n So there has been a coup on the left whereby the Bolsheviks who become communists have\n\n51:19.060 --> 51:25.580\n seized power against the rest of the socialists and anarchists and the entire left.\n\n51:25.580 --> 51:30.660\n And then there's an institutionalization of a position known as general secretary of the\n\n51:30.660 --> 51:34.420\n communist party, right hand man of Lenin.\n\n51:34.420 --> 51:40.220\n Less than six weeks after Lenin has created this position and installed Stalin, Lenin\n\n51:40.220 --> 51:50.060\n has a stroke, a major stroke, and never really returns as a full actor to power before he\n\n51:50.060 --> 51:55.100\n dies of a fourth stroke in January 1924.\n\n51:55.100 --> 52:00.340\n So a position is created for Stalin to run things on Lenin's behalf.\n\n52:00.340 --> 52:02.860\n And then Lenin has a stroke.\n\n52:02.860 --> 52:09.780\n And so Stalin now has this new position general secretary, but he's the right hand of a person\n\n52:09.780 --> 52:15.500\n who's no longer exercising day to day control over affairs.\n\n52:15.500 --> 52:21.420\n Stalin then uses this new position to create a personal dictatorship inside the Bolshevik\n\n52:21.420 --> 52:25.780\n dictatorship, which is the remarkable story I tried to tell.\n\n52:25.780 --> 52:30.540\n So is there anything nefarious about any of what you just described?\n\n52:30.540 --> 52:37.100\n So it seems conveniently that the position is created just for Stalin.\n\n52:37.100 --> 52:42.060\n There was a few other brilliant people, arguably more brilliant than Stalin in the vicinity\n\n52:42.060 --> 52:43.060\n of Lenin.\n\n52:43.060 --> 52:45.720\n Why was Stalin chosen?\n\n52:45.720 --> 52:51.300\n Why did Lenin all of a sudden fall ill?\n\n52:51.300 --> 52:56.940\n It's perhaps a conspiratorial question, but is there anything nefarious about any of this\n\n52:56.940 --> 53:02.780\n historical trajectory to power that Stalin took in creating the personal dictatorship?\n\n53:02.780 --> 53:07.500\n So history is full of contingency and surprise.\n\n53:07.500 --> 53:11.620\n After something happens, we all think it's inevitable.\n\n53:11.620 --> 53:14.040\n It had to happen that way.\n\n53:14.040 --> 53:16.260\n Everything was leading up to it.\n\n53:16.260 --> 53:24.820\n So Hitler seizes power in Germany in 1933, and the Nazi regime gets institutionalized\n\n53:24.820 --> 53:29.220\n by several of his moves after being named chancellor.\n\n53:29.220 --> 53:34.260\n And so all German history becomes a story of the Nazi rise to power, Hitler's rise to\n\n53:34.260 --> 53:35.460\n power.\n\n53:35.460 --> 53:40.780\n Every trend tendency is bent into that outcome.\n\n53:40.780 --> 53:46.800\n Things which don't seem related to that outcome all of a sudden get bent in that direction.\n\n53:46.800 --> 53:51.900\n And other trends that were going on are no longer examined because they didn't lead to\n\n53:51.900 --> 53:53.500\n that outcome.\n\n53:53.500 --> 53:58.740\n But Hitler's becoming chancellor of Germany in 1933 was not inevitable.\n\n53:58.740 --> 54:00.440\n It was contingent.\n\n54:00.440 --> 54:04.660\n He was offered the position by the traditional conservatives.\n\n54:04.660 --> 54:09.820\n He's part of the radical right and the traditional right named him chancellor.\n\n54:09.820 --> 54:15.580\n The Nazi party never outright won an election that was free and fair before Hitler came\n\n54:15.580 --> 54:16.780\n to power.\n\n54:16.780 --> 54:22.180\n And in fact, its votes on the eve of Hitler becoming chancellor declined relative to the\n\n54:22.180 --> 54:24.380\n previous election.\n\n54:24.380 --> 54:33.980\n So there's contingency in history, and so Lenin's illness, his stroke, the neurological\n\n54:33.980 --> 54:40.100\n and blood problems that he had were not a structure in history.\n\n54:40.100 --> 54:45.720\n In other words, if Lenin had been a healthier figure, Stalin might never have become the\n\n54:45.720 --> 54:47.940\n Stalin that we know.\n\n54:47.940 --> 54:53.020\n That's not to say that all history is accidental, just that we need to relate the structural,\n\n54:53.020 --> 54:57.820\n the larger structural factors to the contingent factors.\n\n54:57.820 --> 54:59.540\n Why did Lenin pick Stalin?\n\n54:59.540 --> 55:06.700\n Well, Stalin was a very effective organizer, and the position was an organizational position.\n\n55:06.700 --> 55:08.420\n Stalin could get things done.\n\n55:08.420 --> 55:11.620\n He would carry out assignments no matter how difficult.\n\n55:11.620 --> 55:16.100\n He wouldn't complain that it was hard work or too much work.\n\n55:16.100 --> 55:22.420\n He wouldn't go off womanizing and drinking and ignore his responsibilities.\n\n55:22.420 --> 55:28.140\n Lenin chose Stalin among other options because he thought Stalin was the better option.\n\n55:28.140 --> 55:32.140\n Once again, he wasn't choosing his successor because he didn't know he was going to have\n\n55:32.140 --> 55:34.020\n this stroke.\n\n55:34.020 --> 55:40.780\n Lenin had some serious illnesses, but he had never had a major stroke before.\n\n55:40.780 --> 55:50.340\n So the choice was made based upon Stalin's organizational skills and promise against\n\n55:50.340 --> 55:52.660\n the others who were in the regime.\n\n55:52.660 --> 55:57.900\n Now, they can seem more brilliant than Stalin, but he was more effective, and I'm not sure\n\n55:57.900 --> 55:59.100\n they were very brilliant.\n\n55:59.100 --> 56:04.420\n Well, he was exceptionally competent actually at the tasks for running a government, the\n\n56:04.420 --> 56:07.020\n executive branch, right, of a dictator.\n\n56:07.020 --> 56:08.020\n Yes.\n\n56:08.020 --> 56:11.780\n He turned out to be very adept at being a dictator.\n\n56:11.780 --> 56:18.160\n And so if he had been chosen by Lenin and had not been very good, he would have been\n\n56:18.160 --> 56:20.060\n pushed aside by others.\n\n56:20.060 --> 56:21.780\n Yeah.\n\n56:21.780 --> 56:24.780\n You can get a position by accident.\n\n56:24.780 --> 56:30.700\n You can be named because you're someone's friend or someone's relative, but to hold\n\n56:30.700 --> 56:36.860\n that position, to hold that position in difficult circumstances, and then to build effectively\n\n56:36.860 --> 56:44.060\n a superpower on all that bloodshed, right, you have to be skilled in some way.\n\n56:44.060 --> 56:49.620\n It can't be just the accident that brings you to power because if accident brings you\n\n56:49.620 --> 56:52.340\n to power, it won't last.\n\n56:52.340 --> 56:57.220\n Just like we discovered with Putin, he had some qualities that we didn't foresee at the\n\n56:57.220 --> 57:02.780\n beginning, and he's been able to hold power, not just be named.\n\n57:02.780 --> 57:06.260\n Now, Putin and Stalin are very different people.\n\n57:06.260 --> 57:08.100\n These are very different regimes.\n\n57:08.100 --> 57:10.940\n I wouldn't put them in the same sentence.\n\n57:10.940 --> 57:14.480\n My point is not that one resembles the other.\n\n57:14.480 --> 57:20.980\n My point is that when people come to power for contingent reasons, they don't stay in\n\n57:20.980 --> 57:23.980\n power unless they're able to manage it.\n\n57:23.980 --> 57:29.340\n And Stalin was able to build a personal dictatorship inside that dictatorship.\n\n57:29.340 --> 57:33.700\n He was cunning, he was ruthless, and he was a workaholic.\n\n57:33.700 --> 57:35.260\n He was very diligent.\n\n57:35.260 --> 57:41.560\n He had a phenomenal memory, and so he could remember people's names and faces and events.\n\n57:41.560 --> 57:48.100\n And this was very advantageous for him as he built the machine that became the Soviet\n\n57:48.100 --> 57:50.540\n state and bureaucracy.\n\n57:50.540 --> 57:54.660\n One of the things, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, what you've made me realize\n\n57:54.660 --> 58:02.960\n is this wasn't some kind of manipulative personality trying to gain more power solely, like kind\n\n58:02.960 --> 58:10.460\n of an evil picture of a person, but he truly believed in communism.\n\n58:10.460 --> 58:13.740\n As far as I can understand, again, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but he wanted to\n\n58:13.740 --> 58:26.160\n build a better world by infusing communism into the country, perhaps into the whole world.\n\n58:26.160 --> 58:35.260\n So maybe my question is what role does communism as an idea, as an ideology play in all of\n\n58:35.260 --> 58:36.260\n this?\n\n58:36.260 --> 58:41.100\n What was the power in the people of the time, in the Russian people, actually just the whole\n\n58:41.100 --> 58:43.380\n 20th century?\n\n58:43.380 --> 58:44.880\n You're right.\n\n58:44.880 --> 58:48.180\n Stalin was a true believer, and this is very important.\n\n58:48.180 --> 58:54.260\n He was also hungry for power and for personal power, but just as you said, not for power's\n\n58:54.260 --> 58:57.080\n sake, not only for power.\n\n58:57.080 --> 59:04.720\n He was interested in enacting communism in reality and also in building a powerful state.\n\n59:04.720 --> 59:11.800\n He was a statist, a traditional Russian statist in the imperial sense, and this won him a\n\n59:11.800 --> 59:14.000\n lot of followers.\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:19.140\n The fact that they knew he was a hardcore true believing communist won him a lot of\n\n59:19.140 --> 59:26.000\n followers among the communists, and the fact that he was a hardcore defender of Russian\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:32.000\n state interests now in the Soviet guise also won him a lot of followers.\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:37.740\n Sometimes those groups overlapped, the communists and the Russian patriots, and sometimes they\n\n59:37.740 --> 59:43.660\n were completely different groups, but both of them shared an admiration for Stalin's\n\n59:43.660 --> 59:48.620\n dedication to those goals and his abilities to enact them.\n\n59:48.620 --> 59:55.260\n And so it's very important to understand that however thirsty he was for power, and he was\n\n59:55.260 --> 1:00:02.560\n very thirsty for power, that he was also driven by ideals.\n\n1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:11.380\n Now I don't necessarily think that everyone around Stalin shared those ideals.\n\n1:00:11.380 --> 1:00:16.260\n We have to be careful not to make everybody into a communist true believer, not to make\n\n1:00:16.260 --> 1:00:25.980\n everybody into a great statist Russian patriot, but they were widespread and powerful attractions\n\n1:00:25.980 --> 1:00:27.900\n for a lot of people.\n\n1:00:27.900 --> 1:00:35.520\n And so Stalin's ability to communicate to people that he was dedicated to those pursuits\n\n1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:40.220\n and his ability to drive towards them were part of his appeal.\n\n1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:47.780\n Where he also resorted to manipulation, he also resorted to violence, he lied, he spoke\n\n1:00:47.780 --> 1:00:55.660\n out of all sides of his mouth, he slandered other people, he sabotaged potential rivals.\n\n1:00:55.660 --> 1:01:03.640\n He used every underhanded method, and then some, in order to build his personal dictatorship.\n\n1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:09.060\n Now he justified this, as you said, by appeals to communism and to Soviet power.\n\n1:01:09.060 --> 1:01:10.700\n To himself as well too.\n\n1:01:10.700 --> 1:01:12.680\n To himself and to others.\n\n1:01:12.680 --> 1:01:20.220\n And so he justified it in his own mind and to others, but certainly any means, right,\n\n1:01:20.220 --> 1:01:24.840\n were acceptable to him to achieve these ends.\n\n1:01:24.840 --> 1:01:31.460\n And he identified his personal power with communism and with Russian glory in the world.\n\n1:01:31.460 --> 1:01:37.780\n So he felt that he was the only one who could be trusted, who could be relied upon to build\n\n1:01:37.780 --> 1:01:38.780\n these things.\n\n1:01:38.780 --> 1:01:43.980\n Now, we put ourselves back in that time period.\n\n1:01:43.980 --> 1:01:48.660\n The Great Depression was a very difficult time for the capitalist system.\n\n1:01:48.660 --> 1:01:58.860\n There was mass unemployment, a lot of hardship, fascism, Nazism, Imperial Japan.\n\n1:01:58.860 --> 1:02:04.900\n There were a lot of associations that were negative with the kind of capitalist system\n\n1:02:04.900 --> 1:02:14.420\n that was not a hundred percent, not a monolith, but had a lot of authoritarian incarnations.\n\n1:02:14.420 --> 1:02:21.040\n There was imperialism, colonies that even the democratic rule of law capitalist states\n\n1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:25.900\n had non democratic, non rule of law colonies under their rule.\n\n1:02:25.900 --> 1:02:32.920\n So the image and reality of capitalism during that time period between World War I and World\n\n1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:37.540\n War II was very different from how it would become later.\n\n1:02:37.540 --> 1:02:43.620\n And so in that time period, in that interwar conjuncture after World War I, before World\n\n1:02:43.620 --> 1:02:51.800\n War II, communism held some appeal inside the Soviet Union for sure, but even outside\n\n1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:56.740\n the Soviet Union because the image and reality of capitalism disappointed many people.\n\n1:02:56.740 --> 1:03:01.020\n Now, in the end, communism was significantly worse.\n\n1:03:01.020 --> 1:03:06.700\n Many more victims and the system of course would eventually implode.\n\n1:03:06.700 --> 1:03:11.200\n But nonetheless, there were real problems that communism tried to address.\n\n1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:12.980\n It didn't solve those problems.\n\n1:03:12.980 --> 1:03:17.220\n It was not a solution, but it didn't come out of nowhere.\n\n1:03:17.220 --> 1:03:20.860\n It came out of the context of that interwar period.\n\n1:03:20.860 --> 1:03:29.500\n And so Stalin's rule, some people saw it as potentially a better option than imperialism,\n\n1:03:29.500 --> 1:03:32.740\n fascism and Great Depression.\n\n1:03:32.740 --> 1:03:34.980\n Having said that, they were wrong.\n\n1:03:34.980 --> 1:03:40.300\n It turned out that Stalin wasn't a better alternative to markets and private property\n\n1:03:40.300 --> 1:03:43.540\n and rule of law and democracy.\n\n1:03:43.540 --> 1:03:51.580\n However, that didn't become clearer to people until after World War II, after Nazism had\n\n1:03:51.580 --> 1:03:58.500\n been defeated, Imperial Japan had been defeated, a fascist Italy had been defeated and decolonization\n\n1:03:58.500 --> 1:04:04.620\n had happened around the world, and there was a middle class economic boom in the period\n\n1:04:04.620 --> 1:04:11.100\n from the late 40s through the 70s that created a kind of mass middle class in many societies.\n\n1:04:11.100 --> 1:04:21.660\n So capitalism rose from the ashes as it were, and this changed the game for Stalin and communism.\n\n1:04:21.660 --> 1:04:29.700\n Capitalism is about an alternative to capitalism, and if that alternative is not superior, there's\n\n1:04:29.700 --> 1:04:32.780\n no reason for communism to exist.\n\n1:04:32.780 --> 1:04:41.500\n But if capitalism is in foul odor, if people have a bad opinion, a strong critique of capitalism,\n\n1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:47.020\n there can be appeal to alternatives, and that's kind of what happened with Stalin's rule.\n\n1:04:47.020 --> 1:04:52.980\n But after World War II, the context changed a lot, capitalism was very different, much\n\n1:04:52.980 --> 1:05:00.300\n more successful, nonviolent compared to what it was in the interwar period.\n\n1:05:00.300 --> 1:05:05.620\n And the Soviet Union had a tough time competing against that new context.\n\n1:05:05.620 --> 1:05:12.180\n Now today we see similarly that the image and reality of capitalism is on the question\n\n1:05:12.180 --> 1:05:19.860\n again, which leads some people to find an answer in socialism as an alternative.\n\n1:05:19.860 --> 1:05:23.220\n So you just kind of painted a beautiful picture of comparison.\n\n1:05:23.220 --> 1:05:29.080\n This is the way we think about ideologies because we, is what's working better.\n\n1:05:29.080 --> 1:05:34.660\n Do you separate in your mind the ideals of communism to the Stalinist implementation\n\n1:05:34.660 --> 1:05:41.540\n of communism, and again, capitalism and American implementation of capitalism?\n\n1:05:41.540 --> 1:05:51.940\n And as we look at now the 21st century where, yes, this idea of socialism being a potential\n\n1:05:51.940 --> 1:05:56.240\n political system that we would, or economic system we would operate under in the United\n\n1:05:56.240 --> 1:05:59.580\n States rising up again as an idea.\n\n1:05:59.580 --> 1:06:05.740\n So how do we think about that again in the 21st century, about these ideas, fundamental\n\n1:06:05.740 --> 1:06:07.780\n deep ideas of communism and capitalism?\n\n1:06:07.780 --> 1:06:14.860\n Yeah, so in the Marxist schema, there was something called feudalism, which was supposedly\n\n1:06:14.860 --> 1:06:19.300\n destroyed by the bourgeoisie who created capitalism.\n\n1:06:19.300 --> 1:06:25.020\n And then the working class was supposed to destroy capitalism and create socialism.\n\n1:06:25.020 --> 1:06:27.020\n But socialism wasn't the end stage.\n\n1:06:27.020 --> 1:06:29.780\n The end stage was going to be communism.\n\n1:06:29.780 --> 1:06:37.620\n So that's why the communist party in the Soviet Union first built socialism transcending capitalism.\n\n1:06:37.620 --> 1:06:43.640\n The next stage was socialism and the end game, the final stage was communism.\n\n1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:47.540\n So their version of socialism was derived from Marx.\n\n1:06:47.540 --> 1:06:57.420\n And Marx argued that the problem was capitalism had been very beneficial for a while.\n\n1:06:57.420 --> 1:07:03.700\n It had produced greater wealth and greater opportunity than feudalism had.\n\n1:07:03.700 --> 1:07:08.740\n But then it had come to serve only the narrow interests of the so called bourgeoisie or\n\n1:07:08.740 --> 1:07:11.220\n the capitalists themselves.\n\n1:07:11.220 --> 1:07:17.560\n And so for humanity's sake, the universal class, the working class needed to overthrow\n\n1:07:17.560 --> 1:07:24.660\n capitalism in order for greater productivity, greater wealth to be produced for all of humanity\n\n1:07:24.660 --> 1:07:27.940\n to flourish and on a higher level.\n\n1:07:27.940 --> 1:07:32.920\n So you couldn't have socialism unless you destroyed capitalism.\n\n1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:40.660\n So that meant no markets, no private property, no so called parliaments or bourgeois parliaments\n\n1:07:40.660 --> 1:07:42.300\n as they were called.\n\n1:07:42.300 --> 1:07:50.240\n So you got socialism in Marx's schema by transcending, by eliminating capitalism.\n\n1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:55.440\n Now Marx also called for freedom.\n\n1:07:55.440 --> 1:08:00.540\n He said that this elimination of markets and private property and bourgeois parliaments\n\n1:08:00.540 --> 1:08:04.340\n would produce greater freedom in addition to greater abundance.\n\n1:08:04.340 --> 1:08:15.860\n However, everywhere this was tried, it produced tyranny and mass violence, death and shortages.\n\n1:08:15.860 --> 1:08:16.860\n Everywhere it was tried.\n\n1:08:16.860 --> 1:08:19.820\n There's no exception in historical terms.\n\n1:08:19.820 --> 1:08:22.300\n And so it's very interesting.\n\n1:08:22.300 --> 1:08:26.820\n Marx insisted that capitalism had to be eliminated.\n\n1:08:26.820 --> 1:08:28.900\n You couldn't have markets.\n\n1:08:28.900 --> 1:08:29.900\n Markets were chaos.\n\n1:08:29.900 --> 1:08:31.260\n You needed planning.\n\n1:08:31.260 --> 1:08:35.780\n You couldn't have hiring of wage labor.\n\n1:08:35.780 --> 1:08:37.980\n That was wage slavery.\n\n1:08:37.980 --> 1:08:43.020\n You couldn't have private property because that was a form of theft.\n\n1:08:43.020 --> 1:08:50.540\n So in the Marxist scheme, somehow you were going to eliminate capitalism and get to freedom.\n\n1:08:50.540 --> 1:08:52.280\n It turned out you didn't get to freedom.\n\n1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:58.660\n So then people said, well, you can't blame Marx because he said we needed freedom.\n\n1:08:58.660 --> 1:09:00.580\n He was pro freedom.\n\n1:09:00.580 --> 1:09:04.580\n So it's kind of like dropping a nuclear bomb.\n\n1:09:04.580 --> 1:09:13.960\n You say you're going to drop a nuclear bomb, but you want to minimize civilian casualties.\n\n1:09:13.960 --> 1:09:18.300\n So the dropping of the nuclear bomb is the elimination of markets, private property and\n\n1:09:18.300 --> 1:09:21.180\n parliaments.\n\n1:09:21.180 --> 1:09:25.760\n But you're going to bring freedom or you're going to minimize civilian casualties.\n\n1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:34.860\n So you drop the nuclear bomb, you eliminate the capitalism and you get famine, deportation,\n\n1:09:34.860 --> 1:09:40.880\n no constraints on executive power and not abundance, but shortages.\n\n1:09:40.880 --> 1:09:43.500\n And people say, well, that's not what Mark said.\n\n1:09:43.500 --> 1:09:44.660\n That's not what I said.\n\n1:09:44.660 --> 1:09:47.820\n I said, I wanted to minimize civilian casualties.\n\n1:09:47.820 --> 1:09:52.260\n The nuclear bomb goes off and there's mass civilian casualties.\n\n1:09:52.260 --> 1:09:58.620\n And you keep saying, but I said, drop the bomb, but minimize civilian casualties.\n\n1:09:58.620 --> 1:09:59.680\n So that's where we are.\n\n1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:01.860\n That's history, not philosophy.\n\n1:10:01.860 --> 1:10:07.360\n I'm speaking about historical examples, all the cases that we have.\n\n1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:11.900\n Marx was not a theorist of inequality.\n\n1:10:11.900 --> 1:10:22.240\n Marx was a theorist of alienation, of dehumanization, of fundamental constraints or what he called\n\n1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:29.620\n fetters on productivity and on wealth, which he all attributed to capitalism.\n\n1:10:29.620 --> 1:10:31.880\n Marx wasn't bothered by inequality.\n\n1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:37.060\n He was bothered by something deeper, something worse, right?\n\n1:10:37.060 --> 1:10:44.540\n Those socialists who figured this out, who understood that if you drop the nuclear bomb,\n\n1:10:44.540 --> 1:10:48.380\n there was no way to minimize civilian casualties.\n\n1:10:48.380 --> 1:10:54.820\n All socialists who came to understand that if you eliminated capitalism, markets, private\n\n1:10:54.820 --> 1:11:00.420\n property and parliaments, if you eliminated that, you wouldn't get freedom.\n\n1:11:00.420 --> 1:11:07.960\n Those Marxists, those socialists became what we would call social Democrats or people who\n\n1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:14.520\n would use the state to regulate the market, not to eliminate the market.\n\n1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:22.100\n They would use the state to redistribute income, not to destroy private property and markets.\n\n1:11:22.100 --> 1:11:29.460\n And so this in the Marxist schema was apostasy because they were accepting markets and private\n\n1:11:29.460 --> 1:11:30.460\n property.\n\n1:11:30.460 --> 1:11:33.580\n They were accepting alienation and wage slavery.\n\n1:11:33.580 --> 1:11:38.500\n They were accepting capitalism in principle, but they wanted to fix it.\n\n1:11:38.500 --> 1:11:40.100\n They wanted to ameliorate.\n\n1:11:40.100 --> 1:11:42.240\n They wanted to regulate.\n\n1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:50.340\n And so they became what was denounced as revisionists, not true Marxists, not real revolutionaries,\n\n1:11:50.340 --> 1:11:54.460\n but parliamentary road, parliamentarians.\n\n1:11:54.460 --> 1:12:01.060\n We know this as normal politics, normal social democratic politics from the European case\n\n1:12:01.060 --> 1:12:09.180\n or from the American case, but they are not asking to eliminate capitalism, blaming capitalism,\n\n1:12:09.180 --> 1:12:11.880\n blaming markets and private property.\n\n1:12:11.880 --> 1:12:20.540\n So this rift among the socialists, the ones who are for elimination of capitalism, transcending\n\n1:12:20.540 --> 1:12:27.060\n capitalism, otherwise you could never, ever get to abundance and freedom in the Marxist\n\n1:12:27.060 --> 1:12:34.260\n schema versus those who accept capitalism, but want to regulate and redistribute.\n\n1:12:34.260 --> 1:12:39.220\n That rift on the left has been with us almost from the beginning.\n\n1:12:39.220 --> 1:12:45.820\n It's a kind of civil war on the left between the Leninists and the social democrats or\n\n1:12:45.820 --> 1:12:50.580\n the revisionists as they're known pejoratively by the Leninists.\n\n1:12:50.580 --> 1:13:00.380\n We have the same confusion today in the world today where people also cite Marx saying capitalism\n\n1:13:00.380 --> 1:13:08.820\n is a dead end and we need to drop that nuclear bomb and get freedom, get no civilian casualties\n\n1:13:08.820 --> 1:13:13.940\n versus those who say, yes, there are inequities.\n\n1:13:13.940 --> 1:13:18.340\n There's a lack of equality of opportunity.\n\n1:13:18.340 --> 1:13:22.460\n There are many other issues that we need to deal with and we can fix those issues.\n\n1:13:22.460 --> 1:13:24.980\n We can regulate, we can redistribute.\n\n1:13:24.980 --> 1:13:27.980\n I'm not advocating this as a political position.\n\n1:13:27.980 --> 1:13:30.860\n I'm not taking a political position myself.\n\n1:13:30.860 --> 1:13:36.260\n I'm just saying that there's a confusion on the left between those who accept capitalism\n\n1:13:36.260 --> 1:13:42.220\n and want to regulate it versus those who think capitalism is inherently evil and if we eliminate\n\n1:13:42.220 --> 1:13:48.380\n it we'll get to a better world when in fact history shows that if you eliminate capitalism\n\n1:13:48.380 --> 1:13:50.360\n you get to a worse world.\n\n1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:54.660\n The problems might be real, but the solutions are worse.\n\n1:13:54.660 --> 1:14:00.780\n From history's lessons, now we have deep painful lessons, but there's not that many of them.\n\n1:14:00.780 --> 1:14:04.880\n You know, our history is relatively short as a human species.\n\n1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:13.660\n Do we have a good answer on the left of Leninist, Marxist versus Social Democrat versus capitalism\n\n1:14:13.660 --> 1:14:18.340\n versus any anarchy?\n\n1:14:18.340 --> 1:14:23.660\n Do we have sufficient samples from history to make better decisions about the future\n\n1:14:23.660 --> 1:14:25.580\n of our politics and economics?\n\n1:14:25.580 --> 1:14:26.700\n For sure.\n\n1:14:26.700 --> 1:14:34.020\n We have the American Revolution, which was a revolution not about class, not about workers,\n\n1:14:34.020 --> 1:14:39.140\n not about a so called universal class of the working class, elimination of capitalism markets\n\n1:14:39.140 --> 1:14:44.060\n and the bourgeoisie, but was about the category citizen.\n\n1:14:44.060 --> 1:14:52.040\n It was about universal humanity where everyone in theory could be part of it as a citizen.\n\n1:14:52.040 --> 1:14:55.540\n The revolution fell short of its own ideals.\n\n1:14:55.540 --> 1:14:58.220\n Not everyone was a citizen.\n\n1:14:58.220 --> 1:15:03.220\n For example, if you didn't own property, you were a male but didn't own property.\n\n1:15:03.220 --> 1:15:06.000\n You didn't have full rights of a citizen.\n\n1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:11.300\n If you were a female, whether you own property or not, you weren't a full citizen.\n\n1:15:11.300 --> 1:15:18.940\n If you were imported from Africa against your will, you were a slave and not a citizen.\n\n1:15:18.940 --> 1:15:27.660\n And so not everyone was afforded the rights in actuality that were declared in principle.\n\n1:15:27.660 --> 1:15:35.500\n However, over time, the category citizen could expand and slaves could be emancipated and\n\n1:15:35.500 --> 1:15:37.180\n they could get the right to vote.\n\n1:15:37.180 --> 1:15:40.500\n They could become citizens.\n\n1:15:40.500 --> 1:15:45.900\n Nonproperty owning males could get the right to vote and become full citizens.\n\n1:15:45.900 --> 1:15:49.240\n Females could get the right to vote and become full citizens.\n\n1:15:49.240 --> 1:15:55.980\n In fact, eventually my mother was able to get a credit card in her own name in the 1970s\n\n1:15:55.980 --> 1:15:59.660\n without my father having to co sign the paperwork.\n\n1:15:59.660 --> 1:16:02.140\n It took a long time.\n\n1:16:02.140 --> 1:16:09.300\n But nonetheless, the category citizen can expand and it can become a universal category.\n\n1:16:09.300 --> 1:16:17.360\n So we have that, the citizen universal humanity model of the American Revolution, which was\n\n1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:23.860\n deeply flawed at the time it was introduced, but fixable over time.\n\n1:16:23.860 --> 1:16:28.500\n We also had that separation of powers and constraint on executive power that we began\n\n1:16:28.500 --> 1:16:30.260\n this conversation with.\n\n1:16:30.260 --> 1:16:37.160\n That was also institutionalized in the American Revolution because they were afraid of tyranny.\n\n1:16:37.160 --> 1:16:41.080\n They were afraid of unconstrained executive power.\n\n1:16:41.080 --> 1:16:48.260\n So they built a system that would contain that, constrain it institutionally, not circumstantially.\n\n1:16:48.260 --> 1:16:50.500\n So that's a great gift.\n\n1:16:50.500 --> 1:16:58.040\n Within that universal category of citizen, which has over time come closer to fulfilling\n\n1:16:58.040 --> 1:17:00.260\n its original promise.\n\n1:17:00.260 --> 1:17:05.900\n And within those institutional constraints, that separation of powers, constraint on executive\n\n1:17:05.900 --> 1:17:14.080\n power, within that we've developed what we might call normal politics, left right politics.\n\n1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:20.980\n People can be in favor of redistribution, and government action and people can be in\n\n1:17:20.980 --> 1:17:29.520\n favor of small government, hands off government, no redistribution or less redistribution.\n\n1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:35.260\n That's the normal left right political spectrum, where you respect the institutions and separation\n\n1:17:35.260 --> 1:17:37.340\n of powers.\n\n1:17:37.340 --> 1:17:42.680\n And you respect the universal category of citizenship and equality before the law and\n\n1:17:42.680 --> 1:17:44.620\n everything else.\n\n1:17:44.620 --> 1:17:49.220\n I don't see any problems with that whatsoever.\n\n1:17:49.220 --> 1:17:55.460\n I see that as a great gift, not just to this country, but around the world and other places\n\n1:17:55.460 --> 1:18:00.020\n besides the United States have developed this.\n\n1:18:00.020 --> 1:18:07.020\n The problems arise at the extremes, the far left and the far right that don't recognize\n\n1:18:07.020 --> 1:18:14.180\n the legitimacy either of capitalism or of democratic rule of law institutions.\n\n1:18:14.180 --> 1:18:17.700\n And they want to eliminate constraints on executive power.\n\n1:18:17.700 --> 1:18:23.660\n They want to control the public sphere or diminish the independence of the media.\n\n1:18:23.660 --> 1:18:28.700\n They want to take away markets or private property and redistribution becomes something\n\n1:18:28.700 --> 1:18:30.660\n bigger than just redistribution.\n\n1:18:30.660 --> 1:18:37.380\n It becomes actually that original Marxist idea of transcending capitalism.\n\n1:18:37.380 --> 1:18:41.740\n So I'm not bothered by the left or the right.\n\n1:18:41.740 --> 1:18:45.220\n I think they're normal and we should have that debate.\n\n1:18:45.220 --> 1:18:50.980\n We're a gigantic, diverse country of many different political points of view.\n\n1:18:50.980 --> 1:18:57.900\n I'm troubled only by the extremes that are against the system qua system that want to\n\n1:18:57.900 --> 1:19:03.900\n get rid of it and supposedly that will be the bright path to the future.\n\n1:19:03.900 --> 1:19:08.500\n History tells us that the far left and the far right are wrong about that.\n\n1:19:08.500 --> 1:19:13.140\n But once again, this doesn't mean that you have to be a social democrat.\n\n1:19:13.140 --> 1:19:15.420\n You could be a libertarian.\n\n1:19:15.420 --> 1:19:17.380\n You could be a conservative.\n\n1:19:17.380 --> 1:19:19.160\n You could be a centrist.\n\n1:19:19.160 --> 1:19:24.060\n You could be conservative on some issues and liberal on other issues.\n\n1:19:24.060 --> 1:19:28.300\n All of that comes under what I would presume to be normal politics.\n\n1:19:28.300 --> 1:19:31.920\n And I see that as the important corrective mechanism.\n\n1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:39.580\n Normal politics and market economies, non monopolistic, open, free and dynamic market\n\n1:19:39.580 --> 1:19:40.580\n economies.\n\n1:19:40.580 --> 1:19:47.380\n I don't like concentrations of power politically and I don't like concentrations of power economically.\n\n1:19:47.380 --> 1:19:50.020\n I like competition in the political realm.\n\n1:19:50.020 --> 1:19:53.580\n I like competition in the economic realm.\n\n1:19:53.580 --> 1:19:55.260\n This is not perfect.\n\n1:19:55.260 --> 1:20:03.900\n It's constantly needs to be protected and reinvented and there are flaws that are fundamental\n\n1:20:03.900 --> 1:20:11.260\n and need to be adjusted and addressed and everything else, especially equality of opportunity.\n\n1:20:11.260 --> 1:20:18.480\n Equality of outcome is unreachable and is a mistake because it produces perverse and\n\n1:20:18.480 --> 1:20:20.900\n unintended consequences.\n\n1:20:20.900 --> 1:20:27.620\n Equality of outcome attempts, attempts to make people equal on the outcome side, but\n\n1:20:27.620 --> 1:20:33.060\n attempts to make them more equal on the front end, on the opportunity side.\n\n1:20:33.060 --> 1:20:36.380\n That's really, really important for a healthy society.\n\n1:20:36.380 --> 1:20:38.740\n That's where we've fallen down.\n\n1:20:38.740 --> 1:20:46.780\n Our schools are not providing equality of opportunity for the majority of people in\n\n1:20:46.780 --> 1:20:49.180\n all of our school systems.\n\n1:20:49.180 --> 1:20:51.260\n And so I see problems there.\n\n1:20:51.260 --> 1:20:59.820\n I see a need to invest in ourselves, invest in infrastructure, invest in human capital,\n\n1:20:59.820 --> 1:21:05.860\n create greater equality of opportunity, but also to make sure that we have good governance\n\n1:21:05.860 --> 1:21:11.260\n because governance is the variable that enables you to do all these other things.\n\n1:21:11.260 --> 1:21:17.220\n I've watched quite a bit, returning back to Putin, I've watched quite a few interviews\n\n1:21:17.220 --> 1:21:24.140\n with Putin and conversations, especially because I speak Russian fluently, I can understand\n\n1:21:24.140 --> 1:21:30.780\n often the translations lose a lot.\n\n1:21:30.780 --> 1:21:40.620\n I find the man putting morality aside very deep and interesting.\n\n1:21:40.620 --> 1:21:46.820\n And I found almost no interview with him to get at that depth.\n\n1:21:46.820 --> 1:21:54.820\n I was very hopeful for the Oliver Stone documentary and with him, and to me, because I deeply\n\n1:21:54.820 --> 1:22:00.660\n respect Oliver Stone as a filmmaker in general, but it was a complete failure in my eyes,\n\n1:22:00.660 --> 1:22:03.300\n that interview.\n\n1:22:03.300 --> 1:22:11.740\n The lack of, I mean, I suppose you could toss it up to a language barrier, but a complete\n\n1:22:11.740 --> 1:22:16.340\n lack of diving deep into the person is what I saw.\n\n1:22:16.340 --> 1:22:25.340\n My question is a strange one, but if you were to sit down with Putin and have a conversation,\n\n1:22:25.340 --> 1:22:30.660\n or perhaps if you were to sit down with Stalin and have a conversation, what kind of questions\n\n1:22:30.660 --> 1:22:32.900\n would you ask?\n\n1:22:32.900 --> 1:22:36.460\n This wouldn't be televised unless you want it to be.\n\n1:22:36.460 --> 1:22:43.020\n So this is only you, so you're allowed to ask about some of the questions that are sort\n\n1:22:43.020 --> 1:22:49.740\n of not socially acceptable, meaning putting morality aside, getting into depth of the\n\n1:22:49.740 --> 1:22:50.820\n human character.\n\n1:22:50.820 --> 1:22:52.820\n What would you ask?\n\n1:22:52.820 --> 1:22:57.460\n So once again, they're very different personalities and very different time periods and very different\n\n1:22:57.460 --> 1:22:58.460\n regimes.\n\n1:22:58.460 --> 1:23:08.180\n So what I would talk to Stalin about and Putin about are not in the same category necessarily.\n\n1:23:08.180 --> 1:23:11.120\n So let's take Putin.\n\n1:23:11.120 --> 1:23:16.500\n So I would ask him where he thinks this is going, where he thinks Russia is going to\n\n1:23:16.500 --> 1:23:20.340\n be in 25 years or 50 years.\n\n1:23:20.340 --> 1:23:23.140\n What's the long term vision?\n\n1:23:23.140 --> 1:23:26.700\n What does he anticipate the current trends are going to produce?\n\n1:23:26.700 --> 1:23:35.040\n Is he under the illusion that Russia is on the upswing, that things are actually going\n\n1:23:35.040 --> 1:23:41.740\n pretty well, that in 25 years Russia is going to still be a great power with a tremendous\n\n1:23:41.740 --> 1:23:48.920\n dynamic economy and a lot of high tech and a lot of human capital and wonderful infrastructure\n\n1:23:48.920 --> 1:23:56.420\n and a very high standard of living and a secure borders and sense of security at home.\n\n1:23:56.420 --> 1:24:05.340\n Does he think the current path is leading in that direction and if not, if he understands\n\n1:24:05.340 --> 1:24:12.180\n that the current trajectory does not provide for those kinds of circumstances, does it\n\n1:24:12.180 --> 1:24:14.740\n bother him?\n\n1:24:14.740 --> 1:24:16.540\n Does he worry about that?\n\n1:24:16.540 --> 1:24:20.020\n Does he care about the future 25 or 50 years from now?\n\n1:24:20.020 --> 1:24:22.340\n Deep down, what do you think his answer is?\n\n1:24:22.340 --> 1:24:23.340\n The honest answer?\n\n1:24:23.340 --> 1:24:29.660\n He thinks he's on that trajectory already or he doesn't care about that long term trajectory.\n\n1:24:29.660 --> 1:24:31.760\n So that's the mystery for me with him.\n\n1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:33.340\n He's clever.\n\n1:24:33.340 --> 1:24:36.360\n He has tremendous sources of information.\n\n1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:42.880\n He has great experience now as a world leader having served for effectively longer than\n\n1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:47.720\n Leonid Brezhnev's long 18 year reign.\n\n1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:53.560\n And so Putin has accumulated a great deal of experience at the highest level compared\n\n1:24:53.560 --> 1:24:55.740\n to where he started.\n\n1:24:55.740 --> 1:25:03.000\n And so I'm interested to understand how he sees this long term evolution or non evolution\n\n1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:10.680\n of Russia and whether he believes he's got them on the right trajectory or whether if\n\n1:25:10.680 --> 1:25:12.480\n he doesn't believe that he cares.\n\n1:25:12.480 --> 1:25:16.760\n I have no idea because I've never spoken to him about this, but I would love to hear the\n\n1:25:16.760 --> 1:25:18.700\n answer.\n\n1:25:18.700 --> 1:25:23.360\n Sometimes you have to ask questions not directly like that, but you have to come a little bit\n\n1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:25.280\n sideways.\n\n1:25:25.280 --> 1:25:30.000\n You can elicit answers from people by making them feel comfortable and coming sideways\n\n1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.000\n with them.\n\n1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.080\n And just a quick question.\n\n1:25:33.080 --> 1:25:38.160\n So that's talking about Russia, Putin's role in Russia.\n\n1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:43.820\n Do you think it's interesting to ask, and you could say the same for Stalin, the more\n\n1:25:43.820 --> 1:25:50.640\n personal question of how do you feel yourself about this whole thing?\n\n1:25:50.640 --> 1:25:59.000\n About your life, about your legacy, looking at the person that's one of the most powerful\n\n1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:04.760\n and important people in the history of civilization, both Putin and Stalin, you could argue.\n\n1:26:04.760 --> 1:26:05.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:11.480\n Once you experience power at that level, it becomes something that's almost necessary\n\n1:26:11.480 --> 1:26:14.280\n for you as a human being.\n\n1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:15.400\n It's a drug.\n\n1:26:15.400 --> 1:26:17.360\n It's an aphrodisiac.\n\n1:26:17.360 --> 1:26:18.920\n It's a feeling.\n\n1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:26.560\n You know, you go to the gym to exercise and the endorphins, the chemicals get released.\n\n1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:34.680\n And even if you're tired or you're sore, you get this massive chemical change, which has\n\n1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:39.640\n very dynamic effects on how you feel and the kind of level of energy you have for the rest\n\n1:26:39.640 --> 1:26:41.120\n of the day.\n\n1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:46.680\n And if you do that for a long time and then you don't do it for a while, you're like a\n\n1:26:46.680 --> 1:26:49.760\n drug addict not getting your fix.\n\n1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:50.760\n You miss it.\n\n1:26:50.760 --> 1:26:55.200\n Your body misses that release of endorphins to a certain extent.\n\n1:26:55.200 --> 1:26:58.000\n That's how power works for people like Putin.\n\n1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:04.640\n That's how power works for people who run universities or are secretaries of state or\n\n1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:08.360\n run corporations, fill in the blank.\n\n1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:14.720\n In whatever ways power is exercised, it becomes almost a drug for people.\n\n1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:17.940\n It becomes something that's difficult for them to give up.\n\n1:27:17.940 --> 1:27:20.360\n It becomes a part of who they are.\n\n1:27:20.360 --> 1:27:25.720\n It becomes necessary for their sense of self and well being.\n\n1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:30.840\n The greatest people, the people I admire the most are the ones that can step away from\n\n1:27:30.840 --> 1:27:40.520\n power, can give up the drug, can be satisfied, can be stronger even by walking away from\n\n1:27:40.520 --> 1:27:45.360\n continued power when they had the option to continue.\n\n1:27:45.360 --> 1:27:51.000\n So with a person like Putin, once again, I don't know him personally, so I have no basis\n\n1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:52.680\n to judge this.\n\n1:27:52.680 --> 1:28:00.240\n This is a general statement observable with many people and in historical terms.\n\n1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:05.800\n With a person like Putin who's exercised this much power for this long, it's something that\n\n1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:11.980\n becomes a part of who you are and you have a hard time imagining yourself without it.\n\n1:28:11.980 --> 1:28:17.160\n You begin to conflate your personal power with the well being of the nation.\n\n1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:22.920\n You begin to think that the more power you have, the better off the country is this conflation.\n\n1:28:22.920 --> 1:28:30.040\n You begin to be able to not imagine, you can no longer imagine what it would be like just\n\n1:28:30.040 --> 1:28:38.000\n to be an ordinary citizen or an ordinary person running a company even, something much smaller\n\n1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:39.960\n than a country.\n\n1:28:39.960 --> 1:28:47.840\n So I anticipate that without knowing for sure that he would be in that category of person,\n\n1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:56.360\n but you'd want to explore that with questions with him about, so what's his day look like\n\n1:28:56.360 --> 1:28:57.360\n from beginning to end?\n\n1:28:57.360 --> 1:28:59.640\n Just take me through a typical day of yours.\n\n1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:00.720\n What do you do on a day?\n\n1:29:00.720 --> 1:29:02.280\n How does it start?\n\n1:29:02.280 --> 1:29:03.280\n What are the ups?\n\n1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:04.280\n What are the downs?\n\n1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:07.400\n What are the parts of the day you look forward to the most?\n\n1:29:07.400 --> 1:29:11.140\n What are the parts of the day you don't look forward to that much?\n\n1:29:11.140 --> 1:29:13.520\n What do you consider a good day?\n\n1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:16.460\n What do you consider a bad day?\n\n1:29:16.460 --> 1:29:22.240\n How do you know that what you're doing is having the effects that you intend?\n\n1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:23.760\n How do you follow up?\n\n1:29:23.760 --> 1:29:26.680\n How do you gather the information, the reaction?\n\n1:29:26.680 --> 1:29:31.920\n How do you get people to tell you to your face things that they know are uncomfortable\n\n1:29:31.920 --> 1:29:34.400\n or that you might not want to hear?\n\n1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:35.400\n Those kind of questions.\n\n1:29:35.400 --> 1:29:40.120\n And through that window, through that kind of questioning, you get a window into a man\n\n1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:42.000\n with power.\n\n1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:48.000\n So let me ask about Stalin because you've done more research, there's another amazing\n\n1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:56.960\n interview you've had, the introduction was that you know more about Stalin than Stalin\n\n1:29:56.960 --> 1:29:57.960\n himself.\n\n1:29:57.960 --> 1:30:00.200\n You've done an incredible amount of research on Stalin.\n\n1:30:00.200 --> 1:30:07.640\n So if you could talk to him, get sort of direct research, what question would you ask of Stalin?\n\n1:30:07.640 --> 1:30:12.240\n I have so many questions, I don't even know where I would begin.\n\n1:30:12.240 --> 1:30:18.400\n The thing about studying a person like Stalin, who's an immense creature, right?\n\n1:30:18.400 --> 1:30:23.660\n He's exercising the power of life and death over hundreds of millions of people.\n\n1:30:23.660 --> 1:30:31.720\n He's making decisions about novels and films and turbines and submarines and packs with\n\n1:30:31.720 --> 1:30:39.600\n Hitler or deals with Churchill and Roosevelt and occupation of Mongolia or occupation of\n\n1:30:39.600 --> 1:30:41.320\n North Korea.\n\n1:30:41.320 --> 1:30:49.880\n He's making phenomenally consequential decisions over all spheres of life, all areas of endeavor\n\n1:30:49.880 --> 1:30:56.420\n and over much of the globe, much of the landmass of the earth.\n\n1:30:56.420 --> 1:30:59.760\n And so what's that like?\n\n1:30:59.760 --> 1:31:06.320\n Does he sometimes reflect on the amount of power and responsibility he has that he can\n\n1:31:06.320 --> 1:31:07.800\n exercise?\n\n1:31:07.800 --> 1:31:14.200\n Does he sometimes think about what it means that a single person has that kind of power?\n\n1:31:14.200 --> 1:31:20.120\n And does it have an effect on his relations with others, his sense of self, the kinds\n\n1:31:20.120 --> 1:31:22.660\n of things he values in life?\n\n1:31:22.660 --> 1:31:27.420\n Does he sometimes think it's a mistake that he's accumulated this much power?\n\n1:31:27.420 --> 1:31:30.960\n Does he sometimes wish he had a simpler life?\n\n1:31:30.960 --> 1:31:41.240\n Or is he once again so drunk, so enamored, so caught up with chemically and spiritually\n\n1:31:41.240 --> 1:31:45.500\n with exercising this kind of power that he couldn't live without it?\n\n1:31:45.500 --> 1:31:51.200\n And then what were you thinking, I would ask him, in certain decisions that he made?\n\n1:31:51.200 --> 1:31:56.620\n What were you thinking on certain dates and certain circumstances where you made a decision\n\n1:31:56.620 --> 1:31:59.180\n and could have made a different decision?\n\n1:31:59.180 --> 1:32:02.500\n Can you recall your thought processes?\n\n1:32:02.500 --> 1:32:04.320\n Can you bring the decision back?\n\n1:32:04.320 --> 1:32:06.180\n Was it seat of the pants?\n\n1:32:06.180 --> 1:32:08.400\n Was it something you'd been planning?\n\n1:32:08.400 --> 1:32:12.760\n Did you just improvise or did you have a strategy?\n\n1:32:12.760 --> 1:32:15.000\n What were you guided by?\n\n1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:17.240\n Whose examples did you look to?\n\n1:32:17.240 --> 1:32:20.960\n When you picked up these books that you read and you read the books and you made pencil\n\n1:32:20.960 --> 1:32:25.000\n marks in them, is it because you absorbed the lesson there?\n\n1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:29.640\n Or did it really not become a permanent lesson and it was just something that you checked\n\n1:32:29.640 --> 1:32:32.400\n and it was like a reflex?\n\n1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:39.400\n So I have many specific questions about many specific events and people and circumstances\n\n1:32:39.400 --> 1:32:47.800\n that I have tried to figure out with the surviving source materials that we have in abundance.\n\n1:32:47.800 --> 1:32:53.840\n But I would still like to delve into his mindset and reconstruct his mind.\n\n1:32:53.840 --> 1:33:00.980\n The closer you get to Stalin, in some ways, the more elusive he can become.\n\n1:33:00.980 --> 1:33:06.080\n And especially around World War II, you've already illuminated a lot of interesting aspects\n\n1:33:06.080 --> 1:33:11.160\n about Stalin's role in the war, but it would be interesting to ask even more questions\n\n1:33:11.160 --> 1:33:15.580\n about how seat of the pants or deliberate some of the decisions have been.\n\n1:33:15.580 --> 1:33:23.080\n If I could ask just one quick question, one last quick question, and you're constrained\n\n1:33:23.080 --> 1:33:28.680\n in time and answering it, do you think there will always be evil in the world?\n\n1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:31.200\n Do you think there will always be war?\n\n1:33:31.200 --> 1:33:33.800\n Unfortunately, yes.\n\n1:33:33.800 --> 1:33:40.560\n There are conflicting interests, conflicting goals that people have.\n\n1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:44.960\n Most of the time, those conflicts can be resolved peacefully.\n\n1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:50.520\n That's why we build strong institutions to resolve different interests and conflicts\n\n1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:52.120\n peacefully.\n\n1:33:52.120 --> 1:34:02.200\n But the fact, the enduring fact of conflicting interests and conflicting desires, that can\n\n1:34:02.200 --> 1:34:04.640\n never be changed.\n\n1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:14.040\n So the job that we have for humanity's sake is to make those conflicting interests, those\n\n1:34:14.040 --> 1:34:20.440\n conflicting desires, to make them, to put them in a context where they can be resolved\n\n1:34:20.440 --> 1:34:25.600\n peacefully, and not in a zero sum fashion.\n\n1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:30.480\n So we can't get there on the global scale.\n\n1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:37.080\n So there's always going to be the kind of conflict that sometimes gets violent.\n\n1:34:37.080 --> 1:34:43.280\n What we don't want is a conflict among the strongest powers.\n\n1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:48.240\n Great power conflict is unbelievably bad.\n\n1:34:48.240 --> 1:34:50.320\n There are no words to describe it.\n\n1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:55.920\n At least 55 million people died in World War II.\n\n1:34:55.920 --> 1:35:01.080\n If we have a World War III, a war between the United States and China, or whatever it\n\n1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:05.160\n might be, who knows what the number could be?\n\n1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:14.000\n 155 million, 255 million, 555 million, I don't even want to think about it.\n\n1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:20.120\n And so it's horrible when wars break out in the humanitarian catastrophes.\n\n1:35:20.120 --> 1:35:26.280\n For example, Yemen and Syria and several other places I could name today.\n\n1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:28.640\n It's just horrible what you see there.\n\n1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:32.060\n And the scale is colossal for those places.\n\n1:35:32.060 --> 1:35:34.660\n But it's not planetary scale.\n\n1:35:34.660 --> 1:35:41.000\n And so avoiding planetary scale destruction is really important for us.\n\n1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:49.120\n And so having those different interests be somehow managed in a way that they don't,\n\n1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:54.400\n that no one sees advantage in a violent resolution.\n\n1:35:54.400 --> 1:35:58.200\n And a part of that is remembering history, so they should read your books.\n\n1:35:58.200 --> 1:35:59.440\n Stephen, thank you so much.\n\n1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:01.240\n It was a huge honor talking to you today.\n\n1:36:01.240 -->
