Wright Mills\n\n03:04.740 --> 03:07.340\n called the sociological imagination,\n\n03:07.340 --> 03:11.140\n which is to put that individual biography\n\n03:11.140 --> 03:15.580\n into the long historical sweep of humanity,\n\n03:15.580 --> 03:17.540\n if at all possible.\n\n03:17.540 --> 03:21.020\n My goals are typically more modest than C. Wright Mills's.\n\n03:21.020 --> 03:26.020\n And to then put that biography in the larger social structure\n\n03:26.820 --> 03:29.580\n to try to understand that person's life\n\n03:29.580 --> 03:31.900\n and the way they see the world,\n\n03:31.900 --> 03:34.340\n their decisions in light of their interests\n\n03:34.340 --> 03:36.740\n relative to others and conflict and power\n\n03:36.740 --> 03:38.700\n and all these things that I find interesting.\n\n03:38.700 --> 03:40.180\n And conflict and power.\n\n03:40.180 --> 03:41.020\n And interesting.\n\n03:41.020 --> 03:43.860\n In the context of society and in the context of history.\n\n03:43.860 --> 03:44.700\n Yeah.\n\n03:44.700 --> 03:47.940\n And the small tangent, what does it take to do that,\n\n03:47.940 --> 03:52.940\n to capture this particular group, the spirit, the music,\n\n03:54.500 --> 03:56.340\n the full landscape of experiences\n\n03:56.340 --> 03:58.900\n that a particular group goes through\n\n03:58.900 --> 04:00.780\n in the context of everything else?\n\n04:00.780 --> 04:02.500\n You only have a limited amount of time\n\n04:02.500 --> 04:06.060\n and you come to the table probably with preconceived notions\n\n04:06.060 --> 04:08.820\n that are then quickly destroyed, all that whole process.\n\n04:08.820 --> 04:11.500\n So I don't know if it's more art or science,\n\n04:11.500 --> 04:13.620\n but what does it take to be great at this?\n\n04:14.500 --> 04:18.580\n I do think my first book was a success\n\n04:18.580 --> 04:22.740\n relative to my goals of trying to really get at the heart\n\n04:22.740 --> 04:25.140\n of sort of the central issues\n\n04:25.140 --> 04:28.100\n and the lives being led by people.\n\n04:28.100 --> 04:32.580\n If I have a resource, a talent,\n\n04:32.580 --> 04:34.220\n it's that I'm a good listener.\n\n04:34.220 --> 04:38.900\n I can talk with anybody.\n\n04:38.900 --> 04:41.860\n My wife loves to remark on this\n\n04:41.860 --> 04:44.540\n that I can sort of sit down with anyone.\n\n04:45.460 --> 04:49.020\n I think I learned that from my dad who worked at a factory\n\n04:49.020 --> 04:51.660\n and actually had a lot of truckers go through\n\n04:51.660 --> 04:53.740\n the gate that he operated.\n\n04:53.740 --> 04:57.100\n And he always had a story, a joke for everybody,\n\n04:57.100 --> 04:59.420\n kind of got to know everyone individually.\n\n04:59.420 --> 05:02.460\n And he just taught me that essentially\n\n05:02.460 --> 05:04.740\n everyone has something to teach you.\n\n05:04.740 --> 05:06.500\n And I try to embody that.\n\n05:06.500 --> 05:11.500\n Like that's the rule is for me is every single person\n\n05:11.700 --> 05:14.740\n I interact with can teach me something.\n\n05:14.740 --> 05:16.780\n I gotta ask you, I'm sorry to interrupt\n\n05:16.780 --> 05:19.660\n because I'm clearly of the two of us, the poorer listener.\n\n05:19.660 --> 05:23.060\n I think you're a great listener.\n\n05:23.060 --> 05:23.900\n Thank you.\n\n05:23.900 --> 05:24.940\n I've been listening to the podcast.\n\n05:24.940 --> 05:26.300\n I think you're a great listener.\n\n05:26.300 --> 05:28.420\n I really appreciate that.\n\n05:28.420 --> 05:30.380\n You've done a large number of interviews,\n\n05:30.380 --> 05:32.700\n like you said, of truckers for this book.\n\n05:33.860 --> 05:38.460\n I'm just curious, what are some lessons you've learned\n\n05:38.460 --> 05:43.220\n about what it takes to listen to a person enough,\n\n05:43.220 --> 05:46.380\n maybe guide the conversation enough\n\n05:46.380 --> 05:49.220\n to get to the core of the person, the idea,\n\n05:49.220 --> 05:54.020\n again, the ethnographer goal to get to the core?\n\n05:54.020 --> 05:58.540\n Yeah, I think it doesn't happen in the moment, right?\n\n05:58.540 --> 06:01.900\n So I'm a ruminator.\n\n06:01.900 --> 06:05.780\n I just sit with the data for years.\n\n06:05.780 --> 06:10.300\n I sat with the trucking data for almost 10 full years\n\n06:10.300 --> 06:13.860\n and just thought about the problems and the questions\n\n06:13.860 --> 06:16.900\n using everything that I possibly could.\n\n06:16.900 --> 06:21.900\n And so in the moment, my ideal interview is I open up\n\n06:22.100 --> 06:24.820\n and I say, tell me about your life as a trucker.\n\n06:24.820 --> 06:26.900\n And they never shut up.\n\n06:26.900 --> 06:29.740\n And they keep telling me the things that I'm interested in.\n\n06:29.740 --> 06:32.100\n Now, it never works out that way\n\n06:32.100 --> 06:34.500\n because they don't know what you're interested in, right?\n\n06:34.500 --> 06:38.620\n And so a lot of it is the, as you know,\n\n06:38.620 --> 06:41.620\n I think you're a great interviewer, prep, right?\n\n06:41.620 --> 06:45.060\n So you try to get to know a little bit about the person\n\n06:45.060 --> 06:48.580\n and sort of understand kind of the central questions\n\n06:48.580 --> 06:51.660\n you're interested in that they can help you explore.\n\n06:52.820 --> 06:56.820\n And so I've done hundreds of interviews with truck drivers\n\n06:56.820 --> 06:59.940\n at this point and I should really go back\n\n06:59.940 --> 07:01.220\n and read the original ones.\n\n07:01.220 --> 07:02.460\n They were probably terrible.\n\n07:02.460 --> 07:03.380\n What's the process like?\n\n07:03.380 --> 07:05.460\n You're sitting down, do you have an audio recorder\n\n07:05.460 --> 07:08.900\n and also taking notes or do you do no audio, just notes or?\n\n07:08.900 --> 07:11.980\n Yeah, audio recorder and social scientists\n\n07:11.980 --> 07:13.980\n always have to struggle with sampling, right?\n\n07:13.980 --> 07:15.140\n Like who do you interview?\n\n07:15.140 --> 07:15.980\n Where do you find them?\n\n07:15.980 --> 07:17.540\n How do you recruit them?\n\n07:17.540 --> 07:21.020\n I just happened to have a sort of natural place to go\n\n07:21.020 --> 07:23.140\n that gave me essentially the population\n\n07:23.140 --> 07:24.900\n that I was interested in.\n\n07:24.900 --> 07:27.660\n So all these long haul truck drivers that I was interested in\n\n07:27.660 --> 07:29.380\n they have to stop and get fuel\n\n07:29.380 --> 07:31.900\n and get services at truck stops.\n\n07:31.900 --> 07:35.100\n So I picked a truck stop at the juncture\n\n07:35.100 --> 07:36.980\n of a couple of major interstates,\n\n07:36.980 --> 07:40.460\n went into the lounge that drivers have to walk through\n\n07:40.460 --> 07:44.140\n with my clipboard and everybody who came through,\n\n07:44.140 --> 07:46.660\n I said, hey, are you on break?\n\n07:46.660 --> 07:49.540\n And that was sort of the first criteria was,\n\n07:49.540 --> 07:50.740\n do you have time, right?\n\n07:51.740 --> 07:53.460\n And if they said, yes, I said,\n\n07:53.460 --> 07:57.580\n I'd say, I'm a graduate student at Indiana University.\n\n07:57.580 --> 07:59.260\n I'm doing a study,\n\n07:59.260 --> 08:01.460\n trying to understand more about truck drivers.\n\n08:01.460 --> 08:02.460\n Will you sit down with me?\n\n08:02.460 --> 08:04.940\n And I think the first,\n\n08:04.940 --> 08:08.380\n I think I probably asked like 104 or 103 people\n\n08:08.380 --> 08:09.940\n to get the first 100 interviews.\n\n08:10.820 --> 08:11.860\n That's pretty good odds.\n\n08:11.860 --> 08:13.660\n It's amazing, right?\n\n08:13.660 --> 08:16.700\n For any response rate like that for interviewing,\n\n08:16.700 --> 08:19.580\n these are people who sat down and gave me an hour\n\n08:19.580 --> 08:21.580\n or sometimes more of their time,\n\n08:21.580 --> 08:23.100\n just randomly at a truck stop.\n\n08:23.100 --> 08:26.300\n And it just tells you something about like,\n\n08:26.300 --> 08:28.140\n truckers have something to say.\n\n08:28.140 --> 08:30.220\n They're alone a lot.\n\n08:30.220 --> 08:33.020\n And so I had to figure out how to kind of\n\n08:33.020 --> 08:35.260\n turn the spigot on, you know?\n\n08:35.260 --> 08:38.540\n And I got pretty good at it, I think, yeah.\n\n08:38.540 --> 08:40.180\n So they have good stories to tell\n\n08:40.180 --> 08:41.860\n and they have an active life in the mind\n\n08:41.860 --> 08:43.660\n because they spend so much time on the road\n\n08:43.660 --> 08:45.300\n just basically thinking.\n\n08:45.300 --> 08:47.940\n Yeah, there's a lot of reflection,\n\n08:49.140 --> 08:50.540\n a lot of struggles, you know?\n\n08:50.540 --> 08:53.860\n And they take different forms.\n\n08:53.860 --> 08:55.100\n One of the things that they talk about\n\n08:55.100 --> 08:56.860\n is the impact on their families.\n\n08:56.860 --> 08:59.220\n They say truckers have the same rate of divorce\n\n08:59.220 --> 09:00.380\n as everybody else.\n\n09:00.380 --> 09:03.060\n And that's because trucking saves so many marriages\n\n09:03.060 --> 09:05.220\n because you're not around and ruins so many.\n\n09:05.220 --> 09:06.980\n And so it ends up being a wash.\n\n09:08.900 --> 09:12.820\n So I had this experience.\n\n09:12.820 --> 09:16.420\n I met another person and he recognized me from a podcast.\n\n09:16.420 --> 09:18.980\n And he said, you know, I'm a fan of yours\n\n09:18.980 --> 09:22.660\n and a fan of Joe Rogan, but you guys never talk.\n\n09:22.660 --> 09:24.980\n You always talk to people with Nobel Prizes.\n\n09:24.980 --> 09:27.140\n You always talk to these kinds of people.\n\n09:27.140 --> 09:30.180\n You never talk to us regular folk.\n\n09:31.100 --> 09:33.500\n And that guy really stuck with me.\n\n09:33.500 --> 09:36.620\n First of all, the idea of regular folk is a silly notion.\n\n09:36.620 --> 09:39.260\n I think people that win Nobel Prizes\n\n09:39.260 --> 09:42.260\n are often more boring than the people, these regular folks\n\n09:42.260 --> 09:45.780\n in terms of stories, in terms of richness of experience,\n\n09:45.780 --> 09:48.020\n in terms of the ups and downs of life.\n\n09:48.020 --> 09:51.460\n And, you know, that really stuck with me\n\n09:51.460 --> 09:53.700\n because I set that as a goal for myself\n\n09:53.700 --> 09:56.620\n to make sure I talked to regular folk.\n\n09:57.900 --> 10:02.900\n And you did just this talking, again, regular folk.\n\n10:03.140 --> 10:04.860\n It's human beings.\n\n10:05.940 --> 10:07.500\n All of them have experiences.\n\n10:08.700 --> 10:13.700\n If you were to recommend to talk some of these folks\n\n10:14.340 --> 10:16.900\n with stories, how would you find them?\n\n10:16.900 --> 10:19.620\n Yeah, so I do do this sometimes for journalists\n\n10:19.620 --> 10:21.660\n who will come and they want to write about\n\n10:21.660 --> 10:25.020\n sort of what's happening right now in trucking, you know.\n\n10:25.020 --> 10:26.660\n And I send them to truck stops.\n\n10:26.660 --> 10:29.140\n I say, you know, yeah, there's a town\n\n10:29.140 --> 10:31.460\n called Effingham, Illinois.\n\n10:31.460 --> 10:34.060\n And it's just this place where, you know,\n\n10:34.060 --> 10:36.460\n bunch of huge truck stops, tons of trucks\n\n10:36.460 --> 10:38.740\n and really nothing else out there.\n\n10:38.740 --> 10:41.740\n You know, it's in the middle of corn country.\n\n10:41.740 --> 10:44.660\n And, you know, again, truckers in this, you know,\n\n10:44.660 --> 10:48.100\n sadly, I think, you know, the politics of the day,\n\n10:48.100 --> 10:50.300\n it's changing a little bit.\n\n10:50.300 --> 10:54.060\n I think there's a little, the polarization is getting\n\n10:54.060 --> 10:57.660\n to the trucking industry in ways that, you know,\n\n10:57.660 --> 11:02.420\n maybe we're seeing in other parts of our social world.\n\n11:02.420 --> 11:04.420\n But truckers are generally, you know,\n\n11:04.420 --> 11:07.700\n real open sort of friendly folks.\n\n11:07.700 --> 11:11.380\n Some of them ultimately like to work alone and be alone.\n\n11:11.380 --> 11:15.400\n That's a relatively small subset, I think.\n\n11:15.400 --> 11:17.500\n But all of them are generally, you know,\n\n11:17.500 --> 11:20.140\n kind of open, you know, trusting,\n\n11:20.140 --> 11:21.500\n willing to have a conversation.\n\n11:21.500 --> 11:23.820\n And so, you know, you go to the truck stop\n\n11:23.820 --> 11:26.340\n and you go in the lounge and they're usually,\n\n11:26.340 --> 11:27.460\n there's usually a booth down there\n\n11:27.460 --> 11:28.900\n and somebody is sitting at their laptop\n\n11:28.900 --> 11:32.140\n or on their phone and willing to strike up a conversation.\n\n11:32.140 --> 11:32.980\n You should try that.\n\n11:32.980 --> 11:33.800\n You should, you know.\n\n11:33.800 --> 11:35.060\n That 100% will try this.\n\n11:35.060 --> 11:36.340\n Yeah.\n\n11:36.340 --> 11:38.700\n Just again, we're just going from tangent to tangent.\n\n11:38.700 --> 11:40.720\n We'll return to the main question,\n\n11:40.720 --> 11:43.220\n but what do they listen to?\n\n11:43.220 --> 11:45.700\n Do they listen to talk radio?\n\n11:45.700 --> 11:47.700\n Do they listen to podcasts, audio books?\n\n11:47.700 --> 11:48.820\n Do they listen to music?\n\n11:48.820 --> 11:50.940\n Do they listen to silence?\n\n11:50.940 --> 11:51.780\n Everything.\n\n11:51.780 --> 11:52.600\n Everything.\n\n11:52.600 --> 11:53.440\n Everything.\n\n11:53.440 --> 11:55.440\n Some, I mean, and some still listen to the CB,\n\n11:55.440 --> 11:59.420\n which, you know, it's a ever dwindling group.\n\n11:59.420 --> 12:02.200\n They'll call it the Original Internet Citizens Band.\n\n12:02.200 --> 12:03.860\n You know, back in the 70s,\n\n12:03.860 --> 12:07.300\n they thought it was going to be the medium of democracy.\n\n12:07.300 --> 12:08.980\n And they love to just get on there\n\n12:08.980 --> 12:13.060\n and, you know, cruise along one truck after the other\n\n12:13.060 --> 12:13.900\n and chat away.\n\n12:13.900 --> 12:15.580\n Usually, you know, it's guys who know each other\n\n12:15.580 --> 12:18.620\n from the same company or happen to run into each other.\n\n12:18.620 --> 12:21.860\n But other than that, it's everything under the sun.\n\n12:21.860 --> 12:24.620\n You know, and that's, it's probably one of the stereotypes\n\n12:24.620 --> 12:28.140\n and it's, I think it was more true in the past, you know,\n\n12:28.140 --> 12:32.260\n about the sort of heterogeneity of truck drivers.\n\n12:32.260 --> 12:33.860\n They're a really diverse group now.\n\n12:33.860 --> 12:37.060\n You know, there's definitely a large,\n\n12:37.060 --> 12:40.140\n still a large component of rural white guys\n\n12:40.140 --> 12:42.420\n who work in the industry,\n\n12:42.420 --> 12:45.580\n but there's a huge growing chunk of the industry\n\n12:45.580 --> 12:50.120\n that's immigrants, people of color, and even some women.\n\n12:50.120 --> 12:52.700\n Still huge barriers to women entering it,\n\n12:52.700 --> 12:55.900\n but it's a much more diverse place than most people think.\n\n12:57.060 --> 13:00.140\n So let's return to your journey as a truck driver.\n\n13:00.140 --> 13:03.500\n What did it take to become a truck driver?\n\n13:03.500 --> 13:05.100\n What were the early days like?\n\n13:05.100 --> 13:07.140\n Yeah, so this is, I mean, this is a central part\n\n13:07.140 --> 13:09.900\n of the story, right, that I uncovered.\n\n13:09.900 --> 13:12.000\n And the good part was that I went in\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.300\n without knowing what was gonna happen.\n\n13:14.300 --> 13:19.120\n So I was able to experience it as a new truck driver would.\n\n13:19.120 --> 13:20.880\n It's one of the important stories in the book\n\n13:20.880 --> 13:24.620\n is how that experience is constructed by employers\n\n13:24.620 --> 13:28.060\n to sort of, you know, help you think the way\n\n13:28.060 --> 13:29.900\n that they would like you to think about the job\n\n13:29.900 --> 13:32.980\n and about the industry and about the social relations of it.\n\n13:32.980 --> 13:35.640\n So it's super intimidating.\n\n13:37.280 --> 13:40.080\n I say in the book, you know, pretty handy guy,\n\n13:40.080 --> 13:41.840\n you know, familiar with tools, machines,\n\n13:41.840 --> 13:44.000\n like, you know, comfortable operating stuff,\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:46.780\n like from time I was a kid.\n\n13:46.780 --> 13:50.560\n The truck was just like a whole nother experience.\n\n13:50.560 --> 13:52.840\n I mean, as I think most people think about it,\n\n13:52.840 --> 13:55.320\n it's this big, huge vehicle, right?\n\n13:55.320 --> 13:58.120\n It's really long, it's 70 feet long,\n\n13:58.120 --> 14:00.520\n it can weigh 80,000 pounds.\n\n14:00.520 --> 14:02.640\n You know, it does not stop like a car.\n\n14:02.640 --> 14:04.420\n It does not turn like a car.\n\n14:05.920 --> 14:10.520\n But at least when I started, and this has changed\n\n14:10.520 --> 14:13.120\n and it's part of the technology story of trucking,\n\n14:13.120 --> 14:15.840\n the first thing you had to do was learn how to shift it.\n\n14:15.840 --> 14:19.560\n And it doesn't shift like a manual car.\n\n14:19.560 --> 14:21.080\n The clutch isn't synchronized.\n\n14:21.080 --> 14:24.040\n So you have to do what's called double clutch.\n\n14:24.040 --> 14:26.920\n And it's basically the foundational skill\n\n14:26.920 --> 14:29.560\n that a truck driver used to have to learn.\n\n14:29.560 --> 14:33.640\n So you would, you know, accelerate, say you're in first gear,\n\n14:33.640 --> 14:35.040\n you push in the clutch,\n\n14:35.040 --> 14:37.640\n you pull the shifter out of first gear,\n\n14:37.640 --> 14:39.080\n you let the clutch out,\n\n14:39.080 --> 14:44.080\n and then you let the RPMs of the engine drop an exact amount.\n\n14:44.480 --> 14:46.480\n Then you push the clutch back in\n\n14:46.480 --> 14:48.360\n and you put it in second gear.\n\n14:48.360 --> 14:50.380\n If your timing is off,\n\n14:50.380 --> 14:52.600\n those gears aren't gonna go together.\n\n14:52.600 --> 14:54.800\n So if you're in an intersection,\n\n14:54.800 --> 14:57.280\n you're just gonna get this horrible grinding sound\n\n14:57.280 --> 15:00.720\n as you coast, you know, to a dead stop in the,\n\n15:00.720 --> 15:03.200\n you know, underneath the stoplight or whatever it is.\n\n15:03.200 --> 15:06.240\n So the first thing you have to do is learn to shift it.\n\n15:06.240 --> 15:09.600\n And so at least for me and a lot of drivers\n\n15:09.600 --> 15:12.260\n who are going to private company CDL schools,\n\n15:12.260 --> 15:14.640\n what happens is it's kind of like a bootcamp.\n\n15:14.640 --> 15:17.600\n They ship me three states away from home,\n\n15:17.600 --> 15:19.240\n send you a bus ticket and say,\n\n15:19.240 --> 15:21.580\n ''Hey, we'll put you up for two weeks.''\n\n15:21.580 --> 15:22.860\n You sit in a classroom,\n\n15:22.860 --> 15:25.280\n you sort of learn the theory of shifting,\n\n15:25.280 --> 15:29.400\n the theory of kind of how you fill out your log book,\n\n15:29.400 --> 15:32.680\n rules of the road, you know, you do that maybe half the day.\n\n15:32.680 --> 15:35.500\n And then the other half you're in this giant parking lot\n\n15:35.500 --> 15:38.220\n with one of these old trucks and just like, you know,\n\n15:38.220 --> 15:41.140\n destroying what's left of the thing, you know,\n\n15:41.140 --> 15:43.420\n and it's lurching and belching smoke\n\n15:43.420 --> 15:45.960\n and just making horrible noises and like rattling.\n\n15:45.960 --> 15:48.400\n I mean, in these things, like there's a lot of torque.\n\n15:48.400 --> 15:51.000\n And so if you do manage to get it into gear,\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:52.240\n but the engine's lugging,\n\n15:52.240 --> 15:54.520\n I mean, it can throw you right out of the seat, right?\n\n15:54.520 --> 15:56.560\n So it's this, it's like, you know, it's bull,\n\n15:56.560 --> 15:59.600\n you're trying to ride and it's super intimidating.\n\n16:00.540 --> 16:04.100\n And the thing about it is that for everybody there,\n\n16:04.100 --> 16:07.680\n it's almost everybody there, it's super high stakes.\n\n16:07.680 --> 16:11.080\n So trucking has become a job of last resort\n\n16:11.080 --> 16:12.820\n for a lot of people.\n\n16:12.820 --> 16:16.840\n And so they, you know, they lose a job in manufacturing,\n\n16:16.840 --> 16:20.480\n they get too old to do construction any longer, right?\n\n16:20.480 --> 16:22.320\n The knees can no longer handle it.\n\n16:22.320 --> 16:25.200\n And they get replaced by a machine,\n\n16:25.200 --> 16:27.480\n their job gets, you know, offshored\n\n16:27.480 --> 16:30.080\n and they end up going to trucking because it's a place\n\n16:30.080 --> 16:31.600\n where they can maintain their income.\n\n16:31.600 --> 16:34.540\n And so it's super high stress.\n\n16:34.540 --> 16:36.360\n Like they've left their family behind,\n\n16:36.360 --> 16:38.200\n maybe they quit another job.\n\n16:38.200 --> 16:40.160\n They're typically being charged a lot of money.\n\n16:40.160 --> 16:41.920\n So that first couple of weeks,\n\n16:41.920 --> 16:45.080\n like you might get charged $8,000 by the company\n\n16:45.080 --> 16:47.740\n that you have to pay back if you don't get hired.\n\n16:47.740 --> 16:50.580\n And so the stakes are high and this machine is huge\n\n16:50.580 --> 16:52.460\n and it's intimidating.\n\n16:52.460 --> 16:53.840\n And so it's super stressful.\n\n16:53.840 --> 16:57.660\n I mean, I watched, you know, grown men break down crying\n\n16:57.660 --> 17:00.660\n about like how they couldn't go home and tell their son\n\n17:00.660 --> 17:02.520\n that they had been telling they were gonna, you know,\n\n17:02.520 --> 17:05.200\n go become a long haul truck driver that they'd failed.\n\n17:05.200 --> 17:08.240\n And it's kind of this super high stress system.\n\n17:08.240 --> 17:09.580\n And it's designed that way partly\n\n17:09.580 --> 17:11.960\n because as one of my trainers later told me,\n\n17:11.960 --> 17:14.440\n it's basically a two week job interview.\n\n17:14.440 --> 17:16.520\n Like they're testing you, they're seeing like, you know,\n\n17:16.520 --> 17:19.960\n how's this person gonna respond when it's tough, you know,\n\n17:19.960 --> 17:22.760\n when they have to do the right thing and it's slow\n\n17:22.760 --> 17:24.580\n and, you know, they need to learn something,\n\n17:24.580 --> 17:26.640\n are they gonna rush, you know,\n\n17:26.640 --> 17:29.740\n or are they gonna kind of stay calm, figure it out,\n\n17:29.740 --> 17:31.560\n you know, nose to the grindstone.\n\n17:31.560 --> 17:34.020\n Cause when you're a new truck driver, you're unsupervised,\n\n17:34.020 --> 17:35.780\n you know, and that's what they're really looking for\n\n17:35.780 --> 17:39.600\n is that kind of quality of conscientious work\n\n17:39.600 --> 17:41.160\n that's gonna carry through to the job.\n\n17:41.160 --> 17:43.700\n Well, so the truck is such an imposing part\n\n17:43.700 --> 17:45.880\n of a traffic scenario.\n\n17:45.880 --> 17:49.320\n So you said like turning, it stresses me out every time\n\n17:49.320 --> 17:51.000\n I look at a truck cause they, I mean,\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.840\n the geometry of the problem is so tricky.\n\n17:53.840 --> 17:56.280\n And so if you combine the fact that they have to,\n\n17:56.280 --> 17:58.240\n like everybody, basically all the cars in the scene\n\n17:58.240 --> 17:59.960\n are staring at the truck and they're waiting,\n\n17:59.960 --> 18:02.080\n often in frustration.\n\n18:02.080 --> 18:06.920\n And in that mode, you have to then shift gears perfectly\n\n18:06.920 --> 18:08.420\n and move perfectly.\n\n18:08.420 --> 18:11.080\n And if, when you're new, especially,\n\n18:11.080 --> 18:12.700\n like you'll probably, for somebody like me,\n\n18:12.700 --> 18:15.580\n it feels like it would take years to become calm\n\n18:15.580 --> 18:17.360\n and comfortable in that situation\n\n18:17.360 --> 18:20.600\n as opposed to be exceptionally stressed under the eyes\n\n18:20.600 --> 18:24.360\n of the road, everybody looking at you, waiting for you.\n\n18:24.360 --> 18:27.280\n Is that the psychological pressure of that?\n\n18:27.280 --> 18:28.960\n Is that something that was really difficult?\n\n18:28.960 --> 18:30.080\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n18:30.080 --> 18:33.200\n Again, just, I saw people freeze up, you know,\n\n18:33.200 --> 18:36.380\n in that intersection as, you know, horns are blaring\n\n18:36.380 --> 18:38.800\n and the truck's grinding, you know, gears\n\n18:38.800 --> 18:40.720\n and you just can't, you know, and they just shut down.\n\n18:40.720 --> 18:42.980\n They're like, this isn't for me, I can't do it.\n\n18:42.980 --> 18:45.160\n You're right, it takes years.\n\n18:45.160 --> 18:47.920\n If, you know, trucking is not considered\n\n18:47.920 --> 18:52.360\n a skilled occupation, but, you know, my six months there,\n\n18:52.360 --> 18:54.920\n and I was a pretty good rookie, but when I finished,\n\n18:54.920 --> 18:59.800\n I was still a rookie, even shifting, definitely backing,\n\n18:59.800 --> 19:02.120\n tight corners and situations, you know,\n\n19:02.120 --> 19:05.480\n I could drive competently, but the difference between me\n\n19:05.480 --> 19:08.000\n and someone who had, you know, two, three years\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:13.000\n of experience was, it was a giant gulf between us.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.780\n And between that and the really skilled drivers\n\n19:16.780 --> 19:19.540\n who've been doing it for 20 years, you know,\n\n19:19.540 --> 19:21.180\n it's still another step beyond that.\n\n19:21.180 --> 19:22.660\n So it is highly skilled.\n\n19:22.660 --> 19:25.580\n Would it be fair to break trucking into the task\n\n19:25.580 --> 19:28.420\n of driving a truck into two categories?\n\n19:28.420 --> 19:31.320\n One is like the local stuff, getting out of the parking lot,\n\n19:31.320 --> 19:35.060\n getting into, you know, driving down local streets\n\n19:35.060 --> 19:38.780\n and then highway driving, those two tasks.\n\n19:38.780 --> 19:41.640\n What are the challenges associated with each task?\n\n19:41.640 --> 19:43.900\n You kind of emphasized the first one.\n\n19:43.900 --> 19:48.040\n What about the actual like long haul highway driving?\n\n19:48.040 --> 19:51.540\n Yeah, so, I mean, and they are very different, right?\n\n19:51.540 --> 19:56.540\n And the key with the long haul driving is really a set of,\n\n19:58.340 --> 20:03.260\n the way I came to understand it was a set of habits, right?\n\n20:03.260 --> 20:07.080\n We have a sense of driving, particularly men, I think,\n\n20:07.080 --> 20:10.180\n have a sense of driving as like being really skilled,\n\n20:10.180 --> 20:13.260\n is like the goal and you can kind of maneuver yourself\n\n20:13.260 --> 20:16.540\n out of in and out of tight spaces with great speed\n\n20:16.540 --> 20:18.820\n and breaking and acceleration, you know.\n\n20:20.080 --> 20:22.240\n For a really good truck driver,\n\n20:22.240 --> 20:26.860\n it's about understanding traffic and traffic patterns\n\n20:26.860 --> 20:28.100\n and making good decisions\n\n20:28.100 --> 20:30.380\n so you never have to use those skills.\n\n20:30.380 --> 20:33.740\n And the really good drivers, you know,\n\n20:33.740 --> 20:37.600\n the mantra is always leave yourself an out, right?\n\n20:37.600 --> 20:40.980\n So always have that safe place that you can put that truck\n\n20:40.980 --> 20:43.740\n in case that four wheeler in front of you\n\n20:43.740 --> 20:45.620\n who's texting loses control.\n\n20:46.620 --> 20:50.140\n You know, what are you gonna do in that situation?\n\n20:50.140 --> 20:54.740\n And what really good truck drivers do on the highway\n\n20:54.740 --> 20:56.800\n is they just keep themselves\n\n20:56.800 --> 20:59.500\n out of those situations entirely.\n\n20:59.500 --> 21:03.480\n They see it, they slow down, you know, they avoid it.\n\n21:04.440 --> 21:06.940\n And then the local driving is really something\n\n21:06.940 --> 21:10.540\n that takes just practice and routine to learn.\n\n21:10.540 --> 21:12.260\n You know, this quarter turn,\n\n21:12.260 --> 21:15.900\n it feels like the back of the truck sometimes is on delay\n\n21:15.900 --> 21:16.740\n when you're backing it up.\n\n21:16.740 --> 21:18.480\n So it's like, all right, I'm gonna do a quarter turn\n\n21:18.480 --> 21:22.060\n of the wheel now to get the effect that I want\n\n21:22.060 --> 21:24.060\n like five seconds from now\n\n21:24.060 --> 21:26.780\n in where that tail of that trailer is gonna be.\n\n21:26.780 --> 21:28.260\n And there's just no,\n\n21:28.260 --> 21:30.520\n I mean, some people have a natural talent for that,\n\n21:30.520 --> 21:32.440\n you know, spatial visualization\n\n21:32.440 --> 21:35.060\n and kind of calculating those angles and everything,\n\n21:35.060 --> 21:37.900\n but there's really no escaping the fact\n\n21:37.900 --> 21:40.500\n that you've gotta just do it over and over again\n\n21:40.500 --> 21:42.900\n before you're gonna learn how to do it well.\n\n21:42.900 --> 21:46.500\n Do you mind sharing how much you were getting paid,\n\n21:46.500 --> 21:48.740\n how much you were making as a truck driver\n\n21:48.740 --> 21:50.580\n in your time as a truck driver?\n\n21:50.580 --> 21:54.140\n Yeah, I started out at 25 cents a mile\n\n21:54.140 --> 21:56.780\n and then I got bumped up to 26 cents a mile.\n\n21:56.780 --> 22:01.340\n So we had a minimum pay,\n\n22:01.340 --> 22:03.580\n which was sort of a new pay scheme\n\n22:03.580 --> 22:07.060\n that the industry had started to introduce to, you know,\n\n22:07.060 --> 22:10.180\n because there's lots of unpaid work and time.\n\n22:10.180 --> 22:12.660\n And so we had a minimum pay of $500 a week\n\n22:12.660 --> 22:13.940\n that you would get\n\n22:13.940 --> 22:16.340\n if you didn't drive enough miles to exceed that.\n\n22:17.300 --> 22:19.540\n You get paid in sort of,\n\n22:19.540 --> 22:21.740\n so you get paid when you turn the bills in,\n\n22:21.740 --> 22:24.340\n which is the paperwork that goes with the load.\n\n22:24.340 --> 22:28.480\n So, you know, you have to get that back to your company\n\n22:28.480 --> 22:30.340\n and then that's how they bill the customer.\n\n22:30.340 --> 22:32.460\n And so you might get a bunch of those bills\n\n22:32.460 --> 22:34.420\n that kind of bunch up in one week.\n\n22:34.420 --> 22:38.300\n So, you know, I might get a paycheck for, you know, $1,200.\n\n22:38.300 --> 22:40.980\n And I mean, I was a poor graduate student.\n\n22:40.980 --> 22:44.020\n So this was real, real money to me.\n\n22:44.020 --> 22:47.780\n And so I had this sort of natural incentive to,\n\n22:47.780 --> 22:51.420\n you know, earn a lot or to maximize my pay.\n\n22:51.420 --> 22:54.660\n Some weeks were that minimum, 500, very few.\n\n22:54.660 --> 22:57.340\n And then some I'd get 1200, 1300 bucks.\n\n22:58.220 --> 23:00.660\n Pay has gone up, you know,\n\n23:00.660 --> 23:03.420\n typical drivers now starting in the 30s, you know,\n\n23:03.420 --> 23:05.420\n in the kind of job that I was in.\n\n23:05.420 --> 23:09.020\n 30 cents per mile, 30 to 35.\n\n23:09.020 --> 23:12.020\n So can we try to reverse engineer that math,\n\n23:12.020 --> 23:14.540\n how that maps to the actual hours?\n\n23:14.540 --> 23:19.020\n So the hours connected to driving are so widely dispersed,\n\n23:19.020 --> 23:21.540\n as you said, some of them don't count as actual work,\n\n23:21.540 --> 23:22.780\n some of it does.\n\n23:22.780 --> 23:24.220\n That's a very interesting discussion\n\n23:24.220 --> 23:25.660\n that we'll then continue\n\n23:25.660 --> 23:28.020\n when we start talking about autonomous trucking.\n\n23:28.020 --> 23:31.140\n But, you know, you're saying all these cents per mile\n\n23:31.140 --> 23:31.980\n kind of thing.\n\n23:31.980 --> 23:36.980\n What, how does that map to like average hourly wage?\n\n23:38.060 --> 23:41.100\n Yeah, so, I mean, and this is kind of the,\n\n23:41.100 --> 23:44.020\n this is also an interesting technology story in the end.\n\n23:44.020 --> 23:46.980\n And it's the technology story that didn't happen.\n\n23:46.980 --> 23:49.420\n So pay per mile was, you know,\n\n23:49.420 --> 23:52.500\n invented by companies when you couldn't surveil drivers,\n\n23:52.500 --> 23:53.660\n you didn't know what they were doing, right?\n\n23:53.660 --> 23:56.020\n And you wanted them to have some skin in the game.\n\n23:56.020 --> 23:58.460\n And so you'd say, you know, here's the load,\n\n23:58.460 --> 24:00.780\n it's going from, you know, for me,\n\n24:00.780 --> 24:03.340\n I might start in, you know, the Northeast,\n\n24:03.340 --> 24:05.700\n maybe in upstate New York with a load of beer,\n\n24:05.700 --> 24:07.540\n and say, here's this load of beer,\n\n24:07.540 --> 24:09.420\n bring it to this address in Michigan,\n\n24:09.420 --> 24:11.420\n we're gonna pay you by the mile, right?\n\n24:11.420 --> 24:12.900\n If I was being paid by the hour,\n\n24:12.900 --> 24:16.420\n I might just pull over at the diner and have breakfast.\n\n24:16.420 --> 24:19.060\n So you're paid by the mile,\n\n24:19.060 --> 24:22.500\n but increasingly over time,\n\n24:22.500 --> 24:26.860\n the typical driver is spending more and more time\n\n24:26.860 --> 24:28.300\n doing non driving tasks.\n\n24:28.300 --> 24:30.260\n There's lots of reasons for that.\n\n24:30.260 --> 24:32.980\n One of which is railroads captured a lot of freight\n\n24:32.980 --> 24:34.540\n that goes long distances now.\n\n24:34.540 --> 24:37.380\n Another one is traffic congestion.\n\n24:37.380 --> 24:39.620\n And the other one is that drivers are pretty cheap.\n\n24:39.620 --> 24:41.860\n And they're almost always the low people\n\n24:41.860 --> 24:44.380\n on the totem pole in some segments.\n\n24:44.380 --> 24:48.420\n And so their time is used really inefficiently.\n\n24:48.420 --> 24:51.260\n So I might go to that brewery\n\n24:51.260 --> 24:54.700\n to pick up that load of Bud Light.\n\n24:54.700 --> 24:58.700\n And, you know, their dock staff may be busy\n\n24:58.700 --> 25:00.860\n loading up five other trucks.\n\n25:00.860 --> 25:03.420\n And they'll say, you know, go over there and sit and wait,\n\n25:03.420 --> 25:05.780\n and we'll call you on the CB when the dock's ready.\n\n25:05.780 --> 25:08.900\n So you wait there a couple hours, they bring you in,\n\n25:08.900 --> 25:10.780\n you know, you never know what's happening in the truck.\n\n25:10.780 --> 25:12.660\n Sometimes they're loading it with a forklift,\n\n25:12.660 --> 25:16.260\n maybe they're throwing 14 pallets on there full of kegs.\n\n25:16.260 --> 25:18.420\n But sometimes it'll take them hours, you know,\n\n25:18.420 --> 25:19.860\n and you're sitting in that truck.\n\n25:19.860 --> 25:22.700\n And you're essentially unpaid.\n\n25:22.700 --> 25:26.140\n You know, then you pull out, you've got control\n\n25:26.140 --> 25:27.820\n over what you're gonna get paid\n\n25:27.820 --> 25:29.500\n based on how you drive that load.\n\n25:29.500 --> 25:31.500\n And then on the other end,\n\n25:31.500 --> 25:34.260\n you got a similar situation of kind of waiting, so.\n\n25:34.260 --> 25:37.220\n So if that's the way truck drivers are paid,\n\n25:37.220 --> 25:40.500\n then there's a low incentive for the optimization\n\n25:40.500 --> 25:43.380\n of the supply chain to make them more efficient, right?\n\n25:43.380 --> 25:46.980\n To utilize truck labor more efficiently.\n\n25:46.980 --> 25:48.420\n Absolutely.\n\n25:48.420 --> 25:51.660\n So that's a technology problem that,\n\n25:51.660 --> 25:55.160\n one of several technology problems that could be addressed.\n\n25:57.300 --> 26:01.940\n I mean, so what did, if we just linger on it,\n\n26:01.940 --> 26:06.580\n what are we talking about in terms of dollars per hour?\n\n26:06.580 --> 26:08.260\n Is it close to minimum wage?\n\n26:08.260 --> 26:10.660\n Is it, you know, there's something you talk about,\n\n26:10.660 --> 26:15.660\n there was a conception or a misconception\n\n26:15.660 --> 26:19.780\n that truckers get paid a lot for their work.\n\n26:19.780 --> 26:21.760\n Do they get paid a lot for their work?\n\n26:21.760 --> 26:23.300\n Some do.\n\n26:23.300 --> 26:26.020\n And I think that's part of the complexity.\n\n26:26.020 --> 26:28.900\n So, you know, what interested me as an ethnographer\n\n26:28.900 --> 26:31.020\n about this was, you know, I'm interested\n\n26:31.020 --> 26:32.780\n in the kind of economic conceptions\n\n26:32.780 --> 26:34.300\n that people have in their heads\n\n26:34.300 --> 26:38.380\n and how they lead to certain decisions in labor markets.\n\n26:38.380 --> 26:40.540\n You know, why some people become an entrepreneur\n\n26:40.540 --> 26:43.120\n and other people become a wage laborer,\n\n26:43.120 --> 26:45.700\n or, you know, why some people wanna be doctors\n\n26:45.700 --> 26:47.540\n and other people wanna be truck drivers.\n\n26:47.540 --> 26:50.620\n That conception, right, is getting shaped\n\n26:50.620 --> 26:53.820\n in these labor markets is the argument of the book.\n\n26:53.820 --> 26:57.420\n And the fact that drivers can hear,\n\n26:57.420 --> 26:59.780\n or potential drivers can hear about these, you know,\n\n26:59.780 --> 27:01.940\n workers who make $100,000 plus,\n\n27:01.940 --> 27:04.420\n which happens regularly in the trucking industry.\n\n27:04.420 --> 27:06.700\n There are many truck drivers who make more\n\n27:06.700 --> 27:10.900\n than $100,000 a year, you know, is an attraction.\n\n27:10.900 --> 27:13.780\n But the industry is highly segmented.\n\n27:13.780 --> 27:16.380\n And so the entry level segment,\n\n27:16.380 --> 27:18.500\n and we can probably get into this,\n\n27:18.500 --> 27:20.860\n but, you know, the industry is dominated\n\n27:20.860 --> 27:24.940\n by a few dozen really large companies\n\n27:24.940 --> 27:28.580\n that are self insured and can train new drivers.\n\n27:28.580 --> 27:30.200\n So if you want those good jobs,\n\n27:30.200 --> 27:32.740\n you've gotta have several years,\n\n27:32.740 --> 27:35.020\n up until recently, now the labor market's becoming tighter,\n\n27:35.020 --> 27:38.060\n but you had to have several years of accident free,\n\n27:38.060 --> 27:40.620\n you know, perfectly clean record driving\n\n27:40.620 --> 27:41.760\n to get into them.\n\n27:42.660 --> 27:44.480\n The other part of the segment, you know,\n\n27:44.480 --> 27:46.780\n those drivers often don't make minimum wage.\n\n27:47.820 --> 27:50.340\n But this leads to one of the sort of central issues\n\n27:50.340 --> 27:52.020\n that has been in the courts,\n\n27:52.020 --> 27:56.340\n and in the legislature, in some states,\n\n27:56.340 --> 27:59.260\n is, you know, what should truck drivers get paid for?\n\n27:59.260 --> 28:01.100\n Right, the industry, you know,\n\n28:01.100 --> 28:04.300\n for the last 30 years or so has said, essentially,\n\n28:04.300 --> 28:07.540\n it's the hours that they log for safety reasons\n\n28:07.540 --> 28:11.220\n for the Department of Transportation, right?\n\n28:11.220 --> 28:14.500\n Now, since the drivers are paid by the mile,\n\n28:14.500 --> 28:15.920\n they try to minimize those,\n\n28:15.920 --> 28:19.020\n because those hours are limited by the federal government.\n\n28:19.020 --> 28:19.940\n So the federal government says,\n\n28:19.940 --> 28:22.580\n you can't drive more than 60 hours in a week\n\n28:22.580 --> 28:24.180\n as a long haul truck driver.\n\n28:24.180 --> 28:26.520\n And so you wanna drive as many miles as you can\n\n28:26.520 --> 28:31.460\n in those 60 hours, and so you under report them, right?\n\n28:31.460 --> 28:34.460\n And so what happens is the companies say,\n\n28:34.460 --> 28:38.100\n well, that guy, you know, he only said he logged 45 hours\n\n28:38.100 --> 28:40.580\n of work that week, or 50 hours of work.\n\n28:40.580 --> 28:43.620\n That's all we have to pay him minimum wage for.\n\n28:43.620 --> 28:47.140\n When in fact, typical truck driver in these jobs will work,\n\n28:47.140 --> 28:49.500\n according to most people, would sort of define it as like,\n\n28:49.500 --> 28:51.580\n okay, I'm at the customer location, I'm waiting to load,\n\n28:51.580 --> 28:53.500\n I'm doing some paperwork, you know,\n\n28:53.500 --> 28:55.820\n inspecting the truck, I'm fueling it,\n\n28:55.820 --> 28:58.160\n just waiting to, you know, get put in the dock,\n\n28:58.160 --> 29:01.980\n 80 to 90 hours would be sort of a typical work week\n\n29:01.980 --> 29:04.620\n for one of these drivers.\n\n29:04.620 --> 29:05.900\n And just when you look at that,\n\n29:05.900 --> 29:07.340\n they don't make minimum wage oftentimes.\n\n29:07.340 --> 29:10.420\n Right, just to be clear, what we're dancing around here\n\n29:10.420 --> 29:14.180\n is that a little bit over, a little bit under minimum wage\n\n29:14.180 --> 29:17.500\n is nevertheless most truck drivers seem to be making\n\n29:17.500 --> 29:19.380\n close to minimum wage.\n\n29:19.380 --> 29:23.980\n Like this is the, so like we maybe haven't made that clear.\n\n29:23.980 --> 29:27.180\n There's a few that make quite a bit of money,\n\n29:27.180 --> 29:31.220\n but like you're as an entry and for years,\n\n29:31.220 --> 29:35.500\n you're operating essentially minimum wage\n\n29:35.500 --> 29:37.820\n and potentially far less than minimum wage\n\n29:37.820 --> 29:39.980\n if you actually count the number of hours\n\n29:40.900 --> 29:42.780\n that are taken out of your life\n\n29:42.780 --> 29:44.700\n due to your dedication to trucking.\n\n29:45.780 --> 29:49.420\n Well, if you count like the hours taken out of your life,\n\n29:49.420 --> 29:52.780\n then you gotta go, you know, maybe a full 24.\n\n29:52.780 --> 29:54.340\n That's right, yeah, from family,\n\n29:54.340 --> 29:59.340\n from the high quality of life parts of your life.\n\n29:59.340 --> 30:01.940\n Yeah, and there's a whole nother set of rules\n\n30:01.940 --> 30:03.820\n that the Department of Labor has,\n\n30:03.820 --> 30:06.460\n which basically say that a truck driver\n\n30:06.460 --> 30:09.780\n who's dispatched away from home for more than a day\n\n30:09.780 --> 30:13.300\n should get minimum wage 24 hours a day.\n\n30:13.300 --> 30:16.460\n And that could be a state minimum wage,\n\n30:16.460 --> 30:19.620\n but typically what it would work out to for most drivers\n\n30:19.620 --> 30:22.940\n is that, you know, the minimum wage for a truck driver\n\n30:22.940 --> 30:26.900\n should be 50s of thousands, you know, 55, $60,000\n\n30:26.900 --> 30:28.860\n should be the minimum wage of a truck driver.\n\n30:28.860 --> 30:31.500\n And you've probably heard about the truck driver shortage.\n\n30:31.500 --> 30:34.660\n If, you know, which I hope we can talk about,\n\n30:35.740 --> 30:37.660\n if the minimum wage for truck drivers\n\n30:37.660 --> 30:40.260\n is as it should be on the books at, you know,\n\n30:40.260 --> 30:44.220\n around $60,000, we wouldn't have a shortage of truck drivers.\n\n30:44.220 --> 30:45.420\n Oh, wow.\n\n30:46.340 --> 30:49.300\n And to me, 60,000 is not a lot of money\n\n30:49.300 --> 30:51.340\n for this kind of job.\n\n30:51.340 --> 30:56.340\n Cause you're, this isn't, this is essentially two jobs\n\n30:56.500 --> 30:58.620\n and two jobs where you don't get to sleep\n\n30:58.620 --> 31:03.420\n with your wife or see your kids at night.\n\n31:03.420 --> 31:06.500\n That's 60,000 is a very little money for that.\n\n31:06.500 --> 31:09.540\n But you're saying if it was 60,000,\n\n31:09.540 --> 31:11.300\n you wouldn't even have the shortage.\n\n31:11.300 --> 31:12.540\n If that was the minimum.\n\n31:12.540 --> 31:13.460\n If that was the minimum.\n\n31:13.460 --> 31:14.780\n And I think that's what,\n\n31:14.780 --> 31:17.020\n now we have drivers who start in the 30s.\n\n31:18.180 --> 31:19.580\n Wow, but yeah.\n\n31:19.580 --> 31:22.100\n And I mean, so we're talking two, three jobs really,\n\n31:22.100 --> 31:23.340\n when you look at the total hours\n\n31:23.340 --> 31:25.540\n that people are working at, you know,\n\n31:25.540 --> 31:26.700\n they can work over a hundred.\n\n31:26.700 --> 31:28.540\n If they're a trainer, you know,\n\n31:28.540 --> 31:29.660\n training other truck drivers,\n\n31:29.660 --> 31:31.780\n well over a hundred hours a week.\n\n31:31.780 --> 31:34.260\n So a job of last resort.\n\n31:34.260 --> 31:37.500\n Maybe you can jump around from tangent to tangent.\n\n31:37.500 --> 31:41.540\n This is such a fascinating and difficult topic.\n\n31:41.540 --> 31:46.420\n I heard that there's a shortage of truck drivers.\n\n31:46.420 --> 31:48.300\n So there's more jobs than truck drivers\n\n31:48.300 --> 31:49.780\n willing to take on the job.\n\n31:49.780 --> 31:53.260\n Is that the state of affairs currently?\n\n31:53.260 --> 31:57.460\n I mean, I think the way that you just put that is right.\n\n31:57.460 --> 31:59.820\n We don't have a shortage of people\n\n31:59.820 --> 32:02.860\n who are currently licensed to do the jobs.\n\n32:02.860 --> 32:05.220\n So I'm working on a project for the state of California\n\n32:05.220 --> 32:07.100\n to look at the shortage of agricultural drivers.\n\n32:07.100 --> 32:11.420\n And the first thing that the DMV commissioner of the state\n\n32:11.420 --> 32:13.660\n wanted to look at was, you know,\n\n32:13.660 --> 32:15.700\n is there actually a shortage of licensed drivers?\n\n32:15.700 --> 32:17.740\n He's like, I've got a database here\n\n32:17.740 --> 32:20.020\n of all the people who have a commercial driver's license\n\n32:20.020 --> 32:24.180\n who could potentially have the credential to do this.\n\n32:24.180 --> 32:28.380\n There are about 145,000 jobs in California\n\n32:28.380 --> 32:31.460\n that require a class A CDL,\n\n32:31.460 --> 32:33.580\n which would be that commercial driver's license\n\n32:33.580 --> 32:36.340\n that you need for the big trucks.\n\n32:36.340 --> 32:37.940\n About 145,000 jobs.\n\n32:37.940 --> 32:39.940\n The industry in their, you know,\n\n32:39.940 --> 32:43.820\n regular promotion of the idea that there's a shortage\n\n32:43.820 --> 32:45.900\n is always projecting forward and says,\n\n32:45.900 --> 32:48.540\n you know, we're gonna need 165,000 or so\n\n32:48.540 --> 32:50.500\n in the next 10 years.\n\n32:50.500 --> 32:53.820\n They're currently like 435,000 people licensed\n\n32:53.820 --> 32:57.260\n in the state of California to drive one of these big trucks.\n\n32:57.260 --> 33:01.780\n So it is not at all an absence of people who,\n\n33:01.780 --> 33:03.340\n I mean, and again, going back\n\n33:03.340 --> 33:05.300\n to what we were talking about before,\n\n33:05.300 --> 33:07.180\n getting that license is not something\n\n33:07.180 --> 33:10.460\n that you just walk down to the DMV and take the test.\n\n33:10.460 --> 33:13.940\n Like this is somebody who probably quit another job,\n\n33:13.940 --> 33:18.940\n was unemployed, and took months to go to a training school,\n\n33:19.700 --> 33:22.060\n paid for that training school oftentimes,\n\n33:22.060 --> 33:24.140\n left their family for months,\n\n33:24.140 --> 33:26.540\n invested in what they thought was gonna be\n\n33:26.540 --> 33:28.780\n a long term career, and then said,\n\n33:28.780 --> 33:31.280\n you know what, forget it, I can't, I can't do it.\n\n33:33.540 --> 33:35.460\n So yeah, so it's not just skill,\n\n33:35.460 --> 33:37.540\n it's like they were psychologically invested\n\n33:37.540 --> 33:39.340\n potentially for months, if not years,\n\n33:39.340 --> 33:42.660\n into this kinds of position as perhaps a position\n\n33:42.660 --> 33:46.220\n that if they lose their current job, they could fall too.\n\n33:46.220 --> 33:47.940\n Okay, so that's an indication\n\n33:47.940 --> 33:50.420\n that there's something deeply wrong with the job,\n\n33:50.420 --> 33:53.300\n if so many licensed people are not willing to take it.\n\n33:53.300 --> 33:55.300\n What are the biggest problems\n\n33:55.300 --> 33:59.180\n of the job of truck driver currently?\n\n33:59.180 --> 34:01.540\n Yeah, the job, the problems with the job\n\n34:01.540 --> 34:02.700\n and the labor market, right?\n\n34:02.700 --> 34:07.420\n But let's start with the job, which is, you know, again,\n\n34:07.420 --> 34:11.020\n just so much time that's not compensated directly\n\n34:11.020 --> 34:12.980\n for the amount of time.\n\n34:12.980 --> 34:15.140\n And that's just psychologically,\n\n34:15.140 --> 34:17.980\n and this was a big part of what I studied\n\n34:17.980 --> 34:20.420\n for the first book was, you know,\n\n34:20.420 --> 34:24.460\n that conception of like, what's my time worth, right?\n\n34:24.460 --> 34:28.720\n And like, what truck drivers love is oftentimes,\n\n34:28.720 --> 34:32.980\n is that tangible outcome based compensation.\n\n34:32.980 --> 34:37.020\n So they say, you know what, you know, honest days work,\n\n34:37.020 --> 34:38.820\n I work hard, I get paid for what I do,\n\n34:38.820 --> 34:40.540\n I drive 500 miles today,\n\n34:40.540 --> 34:42.580\n that's what I'm gonna get paid for.\n\n34:42.580 --> 34:44.060\n And then you get to that dock,\n\n34:44.060 --> 34:46.940\n and they tell you, sorry, the load's not ready,\n\n34:46.940 --> 34:49.700\n go sit over there, and you stew.\n\n34:49.700 --> 34:51.580\n And that weight can break you psychologically\n\n34:51.580 --> 34:56.580\n because your time every second becomes more worthless.\n\n34:57.860 --> 34:58.700\n Yeah.\n\n34:58.700 --> 35:00.060\n Or worth less.\n\n35:00.060 --> 35:04.500\n Yeah, and again, the industry is gonna say, for instance,\n\n35:04.500 --> 35:06.300\n okay, well, you know, they've got skin in the game, right?\n\n35:06.300 --> 35:08.060\n That argument about sort of compensation\n\n35:08.060 --> 35:10.700\n based on sort of output, right?\n\n35:10.700 --> 35:12.180\n But that's a holdover from when you couldn't\n\n35:12.180 --> 35:13.020\n observe truckers.\n\n35:13.020 --> 35:15.740\n Now they all have, you know, satellite linked computers\n\n35:15.740 --> 35:18.580\n in the trucks that tell these large companies,\n\n35:18.580 --> 35:21.120\n this driver was, you know, at this GPS location\n\n35:21.120 --> 35:22.780\n for four and a half hours, right?\n\n35:22.780 --> 35:25.900\n So if you wanted to compensate them for that time directly,\n\n35:25.900 --> 35:28.060\n and the trucker can't control what's happening\n\n35:28.060 --> 35:29.740\n on that customer location, you know,\n\n35:29.740 --> 35:31.860\n they're waiting for that, you know, firm,\n\n35:31.860 --> 35:35.100\n that customer to tell them, hey, pull in there.\n\n35:35.100 --> 35:38.260\n And so what it becomes is just a way to shift\n\n35:38.260 --> 35:43.260\n the inefficiencies and the cost of that onto that driver.\n\n35:43.580 --> 35:45.580\n Now it's competitive for customers.\n\n35:45.580 --> 35:48.500\n So if you're Walmart, you might have your choice\n\n35:48.500 --> 35:50.620\n of a dozen different trucking companies\n\n35:50.620 --> 35:52.140\n that could move your stuff.\n\n35:52.140 --> 35:54.500\n And if one of them tells you, hey, you're not moving\n\n35:54.500 --> 35:57.660\n our trucks in and out of your docks fast enough,\n\n35:57.660 --> 35:59.660\n we're gonna charge you for how long our truck\n\n35:59.660 --> 36:01.220\n is sitting on your lot.\n\n36:01.220 --> 36:02.220\n If you're Walmart, you're gonna say,\n\n36:02.220 --> 36:04.580\n I'll go see what the other guy says, right?\n\n36:04.580 --> 36:08.160\n And so companies are gonna allow that customer\n\n36:08.160 --> 36:11.540\n to essentially waste that driver's time, you know,\n\n36:11.540 --> 36:13.440\n in order to keep that business.\n\n36:14.700 --> 36:16.820\n Can you try to describe the economics,\n\n36:16.820 --> 36:18.420\n the labor market of the situation?\n\n36:18.420 --> 36:20.940\n You mentioned freight and railroad.\n\n36:20.940 --> 36:25.940\n What is the sort of the dynamic financials,\n\n36:27.180 --> 36:32.180\n the economics of this that allow for such low salaries\n\n36:32.180 --> 36:35.520\n to be paid to truckers?\n\n36:35.520 --> 36:37.340\n Like what's the competition?\n\n36:37.340 --> 36:41.780\n What's the alternative to transporting goods via trucks?\n\n36:41.780 --> 36:43.340\n Like what seems to be broken here\n\n36:43.340 --> 36:44.860\n from an economics perspective?\n\n36:44.860 --> 36:47.280\n Yeah, so it's, well, nothing.\n\n36:47.280 --> 36:50.560\n It's a perfect market, right?\n\n36:50.560 --> 36:53.400\n I mean, so for economists, this is how it should work, right?\n\n36:53.400 --> 36:55.080\n But the inefficiencies, like you said,\n\n36:55.080 --> 36:59.200\n sorry to interrupt, are pushed to the truck driver.\n\n36:59.200 --> 37:02.280\n Doesn't that like spiral, doesn't that lead to\n\n37:02.280 --> 37:04.480\n a poor performance on the part of the truck driver\n\n37:04.480 --> 37:08.000\n and just like make the whole thing more and more inefficient\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:10.840\n and it results in lower payment\n\n37:10.840 --> 37:12.760\n to the truck driver and so on.\n\n37:12.760 --> 37:17.000\n It just feels like in capitalism,\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.720\n you should have a competing solution\n\n37:19.720 --> 37:21.680\n in terms of truck drivers.\n\n37:21.680 --> 37:25.840\n Like another company that provides transportation via trucks\n\n37:25.840 --> 37:28.640\n that creates a much better experience for truck drivers,\n\n37:28.640 --> 37:32.320\n making them more efficient, all those kinds of things.\n\n37:32.320 --> 37:34.800\n How is the competition being suppressed here?\n\n37:34.800 --> 37:39.320\n Yeah, so it is, the competition is based on who's cheaper.\n\n37:39.320 --> 37:42.040\n And this is the cheapest way to move the freight.\n\n37:42.040 --> 37:44.320\n Now, there are externalities, right?\n\n37:44.320 --> 37:46.800\n I mean, so this is the explanation\n\n37:46.800 --> 37:49.620\n that I think is obvious for this, right?\n\n37:49.620 --> 37:53.820\n There are lots of costs that,\n\n37:53.820 --> 37:55.000\n whether it's that driver's time,\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:57.880\n whether it's the time without their family,\n\n37:57.880 --> 38:02.640\n whether it's the fact that they drive through congestion\n\n38:02.640 --> 38:06.940\n and spew lots of diesel particulates into cities\n\n38:06.940 --> 38:09.760\n where kids have asthma and make our commutes longer\n\n38:09.760 --> 38:11.960\n rather than more efficiently use their time\n\n38:11.960 --> 38:14.800\n by sort of routing them around congestion\n\n38:14.800 --> 38:17.320\n and rush hour and things like that.\n\n38:17.320 --> 38:21.080\n This is the cheapest way to move freight.\n\n38:21.080 --> 38:23.600\n And so it's the most competitive.\n\n38:23.600 --> 38:26.720\n A big part of this is public subsidy of training.\n\n38:26.720 --> 38:31.240\n So when those workers are not paying for the training,\n\n38:31.240 --> 38:32.840\n you and I often are.\n\n38:32.840 --> 38:37.840\n So if you lose your job because of foreign trade\n\n38:38.480 --> 38:43.480\n or you're a veteran using your GI benefits,\n\n38:44.200 --> 38:48.360\n you may very well be offered training,\n\n38:48.360 --> 38:50.640\n publicly subsidized training to become a truck driver.\n\n38:50.640 --> 38:53.200\n And so all of these are externalities\n\n38:53.200 --> 38:55.920\n that the companies don't have to pay for.\n\n38:55.920 --> 38:58.680\n And so this makes it the most profitable way to move freight.\n\n38:58.680 --> 39:02.960\n So trucks is way cheaper than trains?\n\n39:02.960 --> 39:03.920\n Well, over the long,\n\n39:03.920 --> 39:07.720\n so one of the big stories for these companies\n\n39:07.720 --> 39:10.040\n is that the average length of haul,\n\n39:10.040 --> 39:12.960\n which becomes very important for self driving trucks,\n\n39:12.960 --> 39:16.040\n the average length of haul has been steadily declining.\n\n39:17.200 --> 39:19.400\n Over the last 15 years or so,\n\n39:19.400 --> 39:21.080\n and this is industry collected data\n\n39:21.080 --> 39:23.200\n from sort of the big firms that report it,\n\n39:23.200 --> 39:26.640\n but roughly been cut in half from typically\n\n39:26.640 --> 39:30.560\n about a thousand miles to under 500.\n\n39:30.560 --> 39:35.560\n And under 500 is what a driver can move in a day, right?\n\n39:36.200 --> 39:40.960\n So you can get loaded, drive and unload,\n\n39:40.960 --> 39:43.120\n around 400 miles or something like that.\n\n39:44.520 --> 39:48.000\n I wanna steal a good question from the Penn Gazette\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:49.960\n interview you did, which people should read.\n\n39:49.960 --> 39:51.480\n It's a great interview.\n\n39:51.480 --> 39:55.320\n Was there a golden age for long haul truckers in America?\n\n39:55.320 --> 39:58.280\n And if so, this is just a journalistic question.\n\n39:58.280 --> 40:02.560\n And if so, what enabled it and what brought it to an end?\n\n40:02.560 --> 40:05.320\n Wow, I might have to have you read my answer to that.\n\n40:05.320 --> 40:07.600\n That was a few years ago,\n\n40:07.600 --> 40:10.800\n be interesting to compare what I'll say, but.\n\n40:10.800 --> 40:12.880\n I mean, one bigger question to ask, I guess,\n\n40:12.880 --> 40:17.880\n is like Johnny Cash wrote a lot of songs about truckers.\n\n40:17.880 --> 40:22.120\n There used to be a time when perhaps falsely,\n\n40:22.120 --> 40:24.320\n perhaps it's part of the kind of perception\n\n40:24.320 --> 40:26.480\n that you study with the labor markets and so on.\n\n40:26.480 --> 40:28.960\n There was a perception of truckers being,\n\n40:28.960 --> 40:30.320\n first of all, a lucrative job\n\n40:30.320 --> 40:34.440\n and second of all, a job to be desired.\n\n40:34.440 --> 40:37.560\n Yeah, so I mean, this is,\n\n40:37.560 --> 40:40.280\n the trucking industry to me is fascinating,\n\n40:40.280 --> 40:43.600\n but I think it should be fascinating to a lot of people.\n\n40:43.600 --> 40:47.800\n So the golden age was really two different kinds\n\n40:47.800 --> 40:51.080\n of markets as well, right?\n\n40:51.080 --> 40:54.520\n Today we have really good jobs and some really bad jobs.\n\n40:54.520 --> 40:55.760\n We had the Teamsters Union\n\n40:55.760 --> 41:00.760\n that controlled the vast majority of employee jobs.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.360\n And even where they had something called\n\n41:03.360 --> 41:05.480\n the National Master Freight Agreement.\n\n41:05.480 --> 41:10.400\n And this was Jimmy Hoffa who led the union\n\n41:10.400 --> 41:15.400\n through its sort of critical period by the mid 60s\n\n41:15.400 --> 41:19.000\n had unified essentially the entire nation's\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:22.080\n trucking labor force under one contract.\n\n41:22.080 --> 41:26.000\n Now you were either covered by that contract\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:29.040\n or your employer paid a lot of attention to it.\n\n41:29.040 --> 41:32.920\n And so by the end of the 1970s,\n\n41:32.920 --> 41:34.720\n the typical truck driver was making\n\n41:34.720 --> 41:36.360\n well more than $100,000,\n\n41:36.360 --> 41:39.080\n typical truck driver was making more than $100,000\n\n41:39.080 --> 41:41.840\n in today's dollars and was home every night.\n\n41:41.840 --> 41:46.480\n That was without a doubt and even more\n\n41:46.480 --> 41:49.600\n than unionized auto workers, steel workers,\n\n41:49.600 --> 41:52.920\n 10, 20% more than those workers made.\n\n41:53.800 --> 41:56.360\n That was the golden age for sort of job quality,\n\n41:56.360 --> 41:57.680\n wages, teamster power.\n\n41:57.680 --> 42:00.360\n They were without a doubt the most powerful union\n\n42:00.360 --> 42:03.160\n in the United States at that time.\n\n42:03.160 --> 42:05.240\n At the same time in the 1970s,\n\n42:05.240 --> 42:09.160\n you had the mythic long haul trucker.\n\n42:09.160 --> 42:13.240\n And these were the guys who were kind of on the margins\n\n42:13.240 --> 42:15.000\n of the regulated market,\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:16.720\n which is what the teamsters controlled.\n\n42:16.720 --> 42:17.960\n A lot of them were in agriculture,\n\n42:17.960 --> 42:19.560\n which was never regulated.\n\n42:19.560 --> 42:22.360\n So in the new deal, when they decided to regulate trucking,\n\n42:22.360 --> 42:23.760\n they didn't regulate agriculture\n\n42:23.760 --> 42:25.960\n because they didn't wanna drive up food prices,\n\n42:25.960 --> 42:28.240\n which would hurt workers in urban areas.\n\n42:28.240 --> 42:32.280\n So they essentially left agricultural truckers out of it.\n\n42:32.280 --> 42:34.480\n And that's where a lot of the kind of outlaw,\n\n42:34.480 --> 42:39.480\n you know, asphalt cowboy imagery that we get.\n\n42:40.440 --> 42:44.320\n And I grew up, I know you didn't grow up in the US\n\n42:44.320 --> 42:47.280\n at this sort of, you know, as a young child.\n\n42:47.280 --> 42:51.120\n And I'm a bit older than you, but in the late 70s,\n\n42:51.120 --> 42:54.920\n there were movies and TV shows and CBs were a craze.\n\n42:54.920 --> 42:57.600\n And it was all these kind of outlaw truckers\n\n42:57.600 --> 43:00.360\n who were out there hauling some unregulated freight.\n\n43:00.360 --> 43:02.600\n They weren't supposed to be trying to avoid the bears,\n\n43:02.600 --> 43:03.760\n you know, who are the cops.\n\n43:03.760 --> 43:07.080\n And, you know, with all this salty language\n\n43:07.080 --> 43:10.560\n and these like, you know, terms that only they understood\n\n43:10.560 --> 43:13.480\n and, you know, the partying at diners and popping pills,\n\n43:13.480 --> 43:15.600\n you know, the California turnarounds.\n\n43:15.600 --> 43:17.960\n So asphalt cowboys, truly.\n\n43:17.960 --> 43:20.960\n So it's like another form of cowboy movies.\n\n43:20.960 --> 43:22.520\n Oh, absolutely, absolutely.\n\n43:22.520 --> 43:27.520\n And I think that sort of masculine ethos of like,\n\n43:27.920 --> 43:30.080\n you got 40,000 pounds of something you care about,\n\n43:30.080 --> 43:31.280\n I'm your guy, you know,\n\n43:31.280 --> 43:33.360\n you needed to go from New York to California,\n\n43:33.360 --> 43:34.920\n don't worry about it, I got it.\n\n43:34.920 --> 43:37.000\n That's appealing and it's tangible, right?\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.600\n And you think about people who don't wanna be paper pusher\n\n43:39.600 --> 43:41.360\n and sit in the, I deal with office politics,\n\n43:41.360 --> 43:42.840\n like just give me what you care about\n\n43:42.840 --> 43:44.800\n and I'll take care of it, you know, just pay me fair,\n\n43:44.800 --> 43:46.760\n you know, and that appeals.\n\n43:46.760 --> 43:49.560\n You mentioned unions, Teamsters, Jimmy Hoffa.\n\n43:51.040 --> 43:53.320\n Big question, maybe difficult question.\n\n43:53.320 --> 43:56.200\n What are some pros and cons of unions historically\n\n43:56.200 --> 43:58.600\n and today in the trucking space?\n\n43:58.600 --> 44:03.600\n Yeah, well, if you're a worker, there are a lot of pros.\n\n44:03.600 --> 44:04.760\n And I don't, you know,\n\n44:04.760 --> 44:06.680\n and this was one of the things I talked to truckers about\n\n44:06.680 --> 44:07.520\n a lot.\n\n44:07.520 --> 44:09.400\n Yeah, what's their perception of Jimmy Hoffa,\n\n44:09.400 --> 44:11.600\n for example, of unions?\n\n44:11.600 --> 44:15.200\n Yeah, so, and this was probably one of the central\n\n44:15.200 --> 44:16.840\n hypotheses that I had going in there.\n\n44:16.840 --> 44:19.280\n And it may sound, you know,\n\n44:19.280 --> 44:21.040\n someone who does hard science, right?\n\n44:21.040 --> 44:23.640\n You may hear a social scientist, you know,\n\n44:23.640 --> 44:24.840\n sort of use that terminology,\n\n44:24.840 --> 44:26.040\n even other social scientists.\n\n44:26.040 --> 44:26.880\n Hypothesis?\n\n44:26.880 --> 44:28.360\n Yeah, you know, they don't like it,\n\n44:28.360 --> 44:31.040\n but I do like to think that way.\n\n44:31.040 --> 44:33.720\n And my initial hypothesis was that, you know,\n\n44:33.720 --> 44:35.120\n and it's very simple,\n\n44:35.120 --> 44:39.400\n that, you know, the tenure of the driver in the industry\n\n44:39.400 --> 44:43.040\n would have a strong effect on how they viewed unions.\n\n44:43.040 --> 44:45.920\n That, you know, somebody who had experienced unions\n\n44:45.920 --> 44:48.040\n would be more favorable\n\n44:48.040 --> 44:50.880\n and someone who had not would not be, right?\n\n44:51.880 --> 44:55.440\n And that turned out to be the case without a doubt.\n\n44:55.440 --> 44:57.720\n But in an interesting way,\n\n44:57.720 --> 44:59.680\n which was that even the drivers\n\n44:59.680 --> 45:01.680\n who were not part of the union,\n\n45:02.760 --> 45:07.760\n who in the kind of public debate of deregulation\n\n45:09.640 --> 45:12.600\n were portrayed as these kind of small business truckers\n\n45:12.600 --> 45:16.120\n who were getting shut out by the big regulated monopolies\n\n45:16.120 --> 45:17.520\n and the Teamsters Union, you know,\n\n45:17.520 --> 45:19.400\n the corrupt Teamsters Union.\n\n45:19.400 --> 45:22.680\n Even those drivers longed for the days of the Teamsters\n\n45:22.680 --> 45:27.040\n because they recognized the overall market impact\n\n45:27.040 --> 45:27.880\n that they had.\n\n45:27.880 --> 45:31.040\n That trucking just naturally\n\n45:31.040 --> 45:33.680\n tended toward excessive competition\n\n45:33.680 --> 45:36.800\n that meant that there was no profit to be made\n\n45:36.800 --> 45:39.160\n and oftentimes you'd be operating at a loss.\n\n45:39.160 --> 45:41.480\n And so even these, you know,\n\n45:41.480 --> 45:44.480\n the asphalt cowboy owner operators from back in the day\n\n45:44.480 --> 45:47.640\n would tell me when the Teamsters were in power,\n\n45:47.640 --> 45:48.960\n I made a lot more money.\n\n45:48.960 --> 45:51.800\n And, you know, this is, you know, unions,\n\n45:51.800 --> 45:55.360\n at least those kinds of unions, like the Teamsters,\n\n45:55.360 --> 45:58.720\n you know, there's, I think a lot of misconceptions today\n\n45:58.720 --> 46:01.960\n sort of popularly about what unions did back then.\n\n46:01.960 --> 46:04.240\n They tied wages to productivity.\n\n46:04.240 --> 46:08.920\n Like that was the central thing that the Teamsters Union did.\n\n46:08.920 --> 46:11.320\n And, you know, there were great accounts\n\n46:11.320 --> 46:13.960\n of sort of Jimmy Hoffa's perspective\n\n46:13.960 --> 46:17.000\n for all his portrayal as sort of corrupt\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:19.720\n and criminal, and there's, you know, I'm not disputing that.\n\n46:19.720 --> 46:21.200\n He broke a lot of laws.\n\n46:22.600 --> 46:27.600\n He was remarkably open about who he was and what he did.\n\n46:27.600 --> 46:30.400\n He actually invited a pair, a husband and wife team\n\n46:30.400 --> 46:34.000\n of Harvard economists to follow him around\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:37.200\n and like opened up the Teamsters books to them\n\n46:37.200 --> 46:40.240\n so that they could see how he was, you know,\n\n46:40.240 --> 46:43.520\n thinking about negotiating with the employers.\n\n46:43.520 --> 46:46.440\n And the Teamsters, and this goes back to the beginning,\n\n46:46.440 --> 46:48.760\n and this goes back well before Hoffa,\n\n46:48.760 --> 46:52.840\n back to the, you know, 1800s,\n\n46:52.840 --> 46:55.840\n they understood that workers did better\n\n46:55.840 --> 46:57.440\n if their employers did better.\n\n46:57.440 --> 46:59.400\n And the only way the employers would do better\n\n46:59.400 --> 47:01.800\n was if they controlled the market.\n\n47:01.800 --> 47:04.520\n And so oftentimes the corruption in trucking\n\n47:04.520 --> 47:07.720\n was initiated by employers who wanted to limit competition\n\n47:07.720 --> 47:09.560\n and they knew they couldn't limit competition\n\n47:09.560 --> 47:10.880\n without the support of labor.\n\n47:10.880 --> 47:12.920\n And so you'd get these collusive arrangements\n\n47:12.920 --> 47:17.280\n between employers and labor to say no new trucking companies.\n\n47:17.280 --> 47:19.000\n There are 10 of us, that's enough.\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.960\n We control Seattle, we're gonna set the price\n\n47:21.960 --> 47:23.680\n and we're not gonna be undercut.\n\n47:24.720 --> 47:27.200\n When there's a shortage of trucks around, it's great,\n\n47:27.200 --> 47:30.160\n rates go up, but you get too many trucks.\n\n47:30.160 --> 47:33.200\n It's very often that you end up operating at a loss\n\n47:33.200 --> 47:35.400\n just to keep the doors open.\n\n47:35.400 --> 47:36.520\n You know, you don't have any choice.\n\n47:36.520 --> 47:39.520\n You can't, it's what economists called derived demand.\n\n47:39.520 --> 47:41.720\n You can't like make up a bunch of trucking services\n\n47:41.720 --> 47:43.040\n and store it in a warehouse, right?\n\n47:43.040 --> 47:46.040\n You gotta keep those trucks moving to pay the bills.\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:50.400\n Can we also lay out the kind of jobs that are in trucking?\n\n47:50.400 --> 47:52.200\n What are the best jobs in trucking?\n\n47:52.200 --> 47:53.760\n What are the worst jobs in trucking?\n\n47:53.760 --> 47:56.880\n What are we, how many jobs are we talking about today?\n\n47:56.880 --> 47:57.720\n Yeah.\n\n47:57.720 --> 47:59.800\n And what kind of jobs are there?\n\n48:00.880 --> 48:04.200\n So there are a number of different segments\n\n48:04.200 --> 48:08.080\n and the first part would be, you know, are you offering,\n\n48:08.080 --> 48:08.920\n the first question would be,\n\n48:08.920 --> 48:11.280\n are you offering services to the public\n\n48:11.280 --> 48:13.080\n or are you moving your own freight, right?\n\n48:13.080 --> 48:17.680\n So are you a retailer, say Walmart or, you know,\n\n48:17.680 --> 48:19.160\n a paper company or something like that\n\n48:19.160 --> 48:22.080\n that's operating your own fleet of trucks?\n\n48:22.080 --> 48:25.760\n That's private trucking.\n\n48:25.760 --> 48:28.600\n For hire are the folks who, you know,\n\n48:28.600 --> 48:31.080\n offer their services out to other customers.\n\n48:31.080 --> 48:33.000\n So you have private and for hire.\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:37.920\n In general, for hire pays less.\n\n48:37.920 --> 48:40.400\n Is that because of the, something you talk about\n\n48:40.400 --> 48:43.720\n with employee versus contractor situation\n\n48:43.720 --> 48:48.720\n or are they all tricked or led to become contractors?\n\n48:48.840 --> 48:52.040\n That can become a part of it as a strategy,\n\n48:52.040 --> 48:54.840\n but the fundamental reason is competition.\n\n48:54.840 --> 48:58.800\n So those private carriers aren't in competition\n\n48:58.800 --> 49:00.320\n with other trucking fleets, right?\n\n49:00.320 --> 49:02.160\n For their own in house services.\n\n49:02.160 --> 49:05.440\n So, you know, they tend to, and this, you know,\n\n49:05.440 --> 49:07.920\n the question of why private versus for hire\n\n49:07.920 --> 49:09.840\n because for hire is cheaper, right?\n\n49:09.840 --> 49:14.000\n And so if you need that, if that trucking service\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:17.200\n is central to what you do and you cannot afford disruptions\n\n49:17.200 --> 49:19.840\n or volatility in the price of it, you keep it in house.\n\n49:19.840 --> 49:21.440\n You should be willing to pay more for that\n\n49:21.440 --> 49:22.560\n because it's more valuable too\n\n49:22.560 --> 49:23.840\n and you keep it in house and that.\n\n49:23.840 --> 49:25.480\n So that's an interesting distinction.\n\n49:25.480 --> 49:27.400\n What about, and this is kind of moving towards\n\n49:27.400 --> 49:30.200\n our conversation of what can and can't be automated.\n\n49:31.840 --> 49:36.160\n How else does it divide the different trucking jobs?\n\n49:36.160 --> 49:38.160\n So the next big chunk is kind of\n\n49:38.160 --> 49:40.320\n how much stuff are you moving, right?\n\n49:40.320 --> 49:43.520\n And so we have what's called truckload\n\n49:43.520 --> 49:45.960\n and truckload means, you know, you can fill up a trailer\n\n49:45.960 --> 49:50.400\n either by volume or by weight and then less than truckload.\n\n49:50.400 --> 49:52.560\n Less than truckload, the official definition\n\n49:52.560 --> 49:54.280\n is like less than 10,000 pounds.\n\n49:55.600 --> 49:57.360\n You know, this is gonna be a couple of pallets of this,\n\n49:57.360 --> 49:58.720\n a couple of pallets of that.\n\n49:58.720 --> 50:00.960\n The process looks really different, right?\n\n50:00.960 --> 50:04.160\n So that truckload is, you know, point A to point B,\n\n50:04.160 --> 50:08.480\n I'm buying, you know, a truckload of bounty paper towels,\n\n50:08.480 --> 50:11.720\n I'm bringing it into, you know, my distribution center,\n\n50:11.720 --> 50:13.880\n go pick it up at the bounty plant,\n\n50:13.880 --> 50:15.640\n bring it to my distribution center, right?\n\n50:15.640 --> 50:18.000\n Nowhere in between do you stop.\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:19.520\n At least process that freight.\n\n50:19.520 --> 50:22.800\n Less than truckload, what you've got is terminal systems.\n\n50:22.800 --> 50:26.080\n And this is what you had under regulation too.\n\n50:26.080 --> 50:27.880\n And so these terminal systems, what you do is you do\n\n50:27.880 --> 50:29.600\n a bunch of local pickup and delivery,\n\n50:29.600 --> 50:31.160\n maybe with smaller trucks,\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:33.560\n and you pick up two pallets of this here,\n\n50:33.560 --> 50:36.200\n four pallets of this there, you bring it to the terminal,\n\n50:36.200 --> 50:38.360\n you combine it based on the destination,\n\n50:38.360 --> 50:43.040\n you then create a full truckload, you know, trailer,\n\n50:43.040 --> 50:44.560\n and you send it to another terminal\n\n50:44.560 --> 50:46.000\n where it gets broken back down,\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:47.960\n and then out for local delivery.\n\n50:47.960 --> 50:52.240\n That's gonna look a lot like if you send a package by UPS,\n\n50:52.240 --> 50:54.640\n right, they pick all these parcels, right,\n\n50:54.640 --> 50:55.800\n figure out where they're all going,\n\n50:55.800 --> 50:57.640\n put them on planes or in trailers\n\n50:57.640 --> 50:58.720\n going to the same destination,\n\n50:58.720 --> 50:59.720\n then break them out to put them\n\n50:59.720 --> 51:01.440\n in what they call package cars.\n\n51:01.440 --> 51:06.240\n So, before I ask you about autonomous trucks,\n\n51:06.240 --> 51:09.840\n let's just pause for your experience as a trucker.\n\n51:11.080 --> 51:12.480\n Did it get lonely?\n\n51:12.480 --> 51:15.080\n Like, can you talk about some of your experiences\n\n51:15.080 --> 51:16.760\n of what it was actually like?\n\n51:16.760 --> 51:17.920\n Did it get lonely?\n\n51:17.920 --> 51:21.280\n Yeah, no, I mean, it was, I didn't have kids at the time.\n\n51:21.280 --> 51:23.520\n Now I have kids, I can't even imagine it.\n\n51:25.640 --> 51:29.600\n You know, I've been married for five years at the time.\n\n51:29.600 --> 51:31.800\n My wife hated it, I hated it.\n\n51:31.800 --> 51:34.520\n You know, I describe in the book\n\n51:34.520 --> 51:37.080\n the experience of being stuck,\n\n51:37.080 --> 51:39.240\n if I remember correctly, it was like Ohio\n\n51:40.280 --> 51:42.520\n at this truck stop in the middle of nowhere\n\n51:42.520 --> 51:46.320\n and like, you know, sitting on this concrete barrier\n\n51:46.320 --> 51:48.720\n and just watching fireworks in the distance\n\n51:48.720 --> 51:51.960\n and like eating Chinese food on the 4th of July.\n\n51:51.960 --> 51:55.480\n And you know, my wife calls me from like the family barbecue\n\n51:55.480 --> 51:57.400\n and our anniversary is July 8th.\n\n51:57.400 --> 51:59.080\n And she's like, are you gonna be home?\n\n51:59.080 --> 52:01.760\n And I'm like, I don't know, you know.\n\n52:03.200 --> 52:08.200\n I have a cousin whose husband drove truck\n\n52:09.400 --> 52:12.000\n as a truck driver would say, drove truck for a while.\n\n52:13.520 --> 52:15.360\n And he told me before I went into it,\n\n52:15.360 --> 52:18.600\n he was like, the advantage you have is that you know\n\n52:18.600 --> 52:21.000\n that you're not gonna be doing this long term.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:24.480\n Like, and Lex, I can't even like,\n\n52:24.480 --> 52:27.800\n the emotional content of some of these interviews,\n\n52:27.800 --> 52:30.440\n I mean, I would sit down at a truck stop with somebody\n\n52:30.440 --> 52:33.920\n I had never met before and you know, you open the spicket\n\n52:33.920 --> 52:37.560\n and the last question I would ask drivers\n\n52:37.560 --> 52:40.720\n was that by the time I really sort of figured out\n\n52:40.720 --> 52:43.160\n how to do it, the last question I would ask them is,\n\n52:43.160 --> 52:45.800\n you know, what advice would you give to somebody,\n\n52:45.800 --> 52:50.200\n like your nephew, you know, a family friend asks you\n\n52:50.200 --> 52:52.200\n about what it's like to be a driver and should they do it?\n\n52:52.200 --> 52:54.120\n What advice would you give them?\n\n52:54.120 --> 52:57.120\n And this question, some of these, you know,\n\n52:57.120 --> 53:00.800\n grizzled old drivers, you know, tough, tough guys,\n\n53:00.800 --> 53:04.400\n would that question would like, some of them would break down\n\n53:04.400 --> 53:06.920\n and they would say, I would say to them,\n\n53:06.920 --> 53:08.680\n you better have everything\n\n53:08.680 --> 53:11.680\n that you ever wanted in life already.\n\n53:11.680 --> 53:15.280\n Because I've had a car that I've had for 10 years,\n\n53:15.280 --> 53:17.080\n it's got 7,000 miles on it.\n\n53:17.080 --> 53:21.800\n I own a boat that hasn't seen the water in five years.\n\n53:21.800 --> 53:24.200\n My kids, I didn't raise them.\n\n53:24.200 --> 53:27.360\n Like I'd be out for two weeks at a time,\n\n53:27.360 --> 53:31.480\n I'd come home, my wife would give me two kids to punish,\n\n53:31.480 --> 53:34.560\n a list of things to do, you know, on Saturday night\n\n53:34.560 --> 53:37.400\n and I might leave out Sunday night or Monday morning.\n\n53:37.400 --> 53:39.480\n You know, I come home dead tired,\n\n53:39.480 --> 53:41.840\n my kids don't know who I am.\n\n53:41.840 --> 53:43.840\n And you know, it was just like,\n\n53:44.720 --> 53:46.920\n it was heartbreaking to hear those stories.\n\n53:46.920 --> 53:49.400\n And then before you know it, you know,\n\n53:49.400 --> 53:52.520\n life is short and just the years run away.\n\n53:52.520 --> 53:54.840\n Yeah.\n\n53:54.840 --> 53:56.600\n Hard question to ask in that context,\n\n53:56.600 --> 53:58.440\n but what's the best,\n\n53:58.440 --> 54:02.200\n what was the best part of being a truck driver?\n\n54:04.120 --> 54:08.160\n Was there moments that you truly enjoyed on the road?\n\n54:08.160 --> 54:09.000\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:13.120\n There was, there's definitely a pride and mastery of,\n\n54:13.120 --> 54:14.600\n you know, even basic competence\n\n54:14.600 --> 54:17.080\n of sort of piloting this thing safely.\n\n54:17.080 --> 54:18.600\n There's a lot of responsibility to it.\n\n54:18.600 --> 54:21.320\n That thing's dangerous and you know it.\n\n54:21.320 --> 54:23.280\n So there's some pride there.\n\n54:23.280 --> 54:26.320\n For me personally, and I know for a lot of other drivers,\n\n54:26.320 --> 54:29.320\n it's just like seeing these behind the scenes places\n\n54:29.320 --> 54:32.280\n that you know exist in our economy.\n\n54:32.280 --> 54:35.840\n And I think we're all much more aware of them now\n\n54:35.840 --> 54:38.960\n after COVID and supply chain mess that we have.\n\n54:38.960 --> 54:40.360\n I don't know if we'll talk about that,\n\n54:40.360 --> 54:42.800\n but you know, you get to see those places.\n\n54:42.800 --> 54:44.320\n You know, you get to see those ports.\n\n54:44.320 --> 54:47.840\n You get to see the place where they make the cardboard boxes\n\n54:47.840 --> 54:49.600\n that the Huggies diapers go in.\n\n54:49.600 --> 54:52.320\n Or the warehouse full of Bud Light.\n\n54:52.320 --> 54:55.400\n I moved Bud Light from like upstate New York\n\n54:55.400 --> 54:58.680\n and the first load like went to Atlanta, you know?\n\n54:58.680 --> 55:00.240\n And then a couple months later,\n\n55:00.240 --> 55:02.360\n I circled back through that same brewery\n\n55:02.360 --> 55:07.040\n and I brought a load of Bud Light out to Michigan.\n\n55:07.040 --> 55:09.720\n And I was like, holy shit, all the Bud Light,\n\n55:09.720 --> 55:12.280\n like, you know, for this whole giant swath\n\n55:12.280 --> 55:14.320\n of the United States comes from this one plant,\n\n55:14.320 --> 55:16.560\n this cavernous plant with like kegs of beer.\n\n55:16.560 --> 55:18.760\n And you see that part of the economy\n\n55:18.760 --> 55:22.680\n and it's like, you're almost like you're an economic tourist.\n\n55:22.680 --> 55:25.760\n And I think all, everybody kind of appreciates that.\n\n55:25.760 --> 55:28.560\n Like kind of, it's almost like a behind the scenes tour.\n\n55:29.440 --> 55:31.240\n That wears off after a few months, you know?\n\n55:31.240 --> 55:34.320\n You start to see new things less and less frequently.\n\n55:34.320 --> 55:37.240\n At first, everything's novel and sort of life on the road.\n\n55:37.240 --> 55:40.600\n And then it becomes just endless miles of white lines\n\n55:40.600 --> 55:43.000\n and yellow lines and truck stops.\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:46.280\n And the days just blur together.\n\n55:46.280 --> 55:47.760\n You know, it's one loading dock.\n\n55:47.760 --> 55:49.640\n It's one loading dock after another.\n\n55:49.640 --> 55:52.440\n So you lose the magic of being on the road.\n\n55:52.440 --> 55:55.080\n Yeah, it's very rare the driver that doesn't.\n\n55:58.320 --> 56:00.480\n You mentioned COVID and supply chain.\n\n56:01.320 --> 56:04.880\n While being this, for a brief time,\n\n56:04.880 --> 56:06.960\n this member of the supply chain,\n\n56:06.960 --> 56:11.320\n what have you come to understand about our supply chain,\n\n56:11.320 --> 56:14.800\n United States and global and its resilience\n\n56:14.800 --> 56:18.680\n against strategies, catastrophic in the world?\n\n56:18.680 --> 56:20.240\n Like COVID, for example.\n\n56:20.240 --> 56:24.360\n Yeah, I mean, we have built really long,\n\n56:24.360 --> 56:26.840\n really lean supply chains.\n\n56:26.840 --> 56:30.400\n And just by definition, they're fragile.\n\n56:31.520 --> 56:34.320\n You know, the current mess that we have,\n\n56:34.320 --> 56:37.240\n it's not gonna clear by Christmas.\n\n56:37.240 --> 56:39.960\n It will be lucky if it clears by next Christmas.\n\n56:39.960 --> 56:42.000\n Can you describe the current mess in supply chain\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:43.080\n that you're referring to?\n\n56:43.080 --> 56:46.960\n Yeah, so we've got pile ups of ships\n\n56:46.960 --> 56:50.240\n off the coast of California, Long Beach,\n\n56:50.240 --> 56:54.840\n and LA in particular, in bad shape.\n\n56:54.840 --> 56:56.880\n You know, last I checked, it was around 60 ships,\n\n56:56.880 --> 57:00.560\n all of which are holding thousands of containers\n\n57:00.560 --> 57:02.720\n full of stuff that retailers were hoping\n\n57:02.720 --> 57:06.180\n was gonna be on shelves for the holiday season.\n\n57:07.380 --> 57:10.460\n Meanwhile, the port itself has stacks and stacks\n\n57:10.460 --> 57:12.760\n of containers that they can't get rid of.\n\n57:12.760 --> 57:15.760\n The truckers aren't showing up to pick up\n\n57:15.760 --> 57:17.560\n the containers that are there,\n\n57:17.560 --> 57:21.620\n so they can't offload the ships that are waiting.\n\n57:22.820 --> 57:26.240\n And why aren't the truckers picking it up?\n\n57:26.240 --> 57:28.280\n Partly because there's a long history of inefficiency\n\n57:28.280 --> 57:29.600\n in making them wait,\n\n57:29.600 --> 57:31.940\n but it's because the warehouses are full.\n\n57:31.940 --> 57:36.500\n So we've had all these perverse outcomes\n\n57:36.500 --> 57:38.040\n that no one really expected.\n\n57:38.040 --> 57:40.360\n Like in the middle of all these shortages,\n\n57:40.360 --> 57:43.320\n people are stockpiling stuff.\n\n57:43.320 --> 57:47.240\n So there are suppliers who used to keep two months\n\n57:47.240 --> 57:50.640\n of supply of bottled water on hand.\n\n57:50.640 --> 57:53.600\n And after going through COVID and not having supply\n\n57:53.600 --> 57:55.520\n to send to their customers,\n\n57:55.520 --> 57:58.280\n they're like, we need three months.\n\n57:58.280 --> 58:02.520\n Well, our system is not designed for major storage of goods\n\n58:02.520 --> 58:04.680\n to go up 50% in a category.\n\n58:04.680 --> 58:05.720\n It's lean.\n\n58:05.720 --> 58:07.040\n If you're a warehouse operator,\n\n58:07.040 --> 58:08.660\n you know, you wanna be 90% plus.\n\n58:08.660 --> 58:10.740\n You don't want a lot of open bays sitting around.\n\n58:10.740 --> 58:15.740\n So we don't have 10% extra capacity in warehouses.\n\n58:16.280 --> 58:18.080\n We don't have 10% of them.\n\n58:18.080 --> 58:19.780\n Trucking capacity can fluctuate a bit,\n\n58:19.780 --> 58:23.600\n but you don't have that kind of slack.\n\n58:23.600 --> 58:26.000\n And now, I mean, and we saw this\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:28.280\n right when people shifted consumption.\n\n58:28.280 --> 58:32.760\n And I get a little mad when people talk about panic buying\n\n58:32.760 --> 58:36.680\n as kind of the reason that we had all these shortages.\n\n58:36.680 --> 58:40.320\n It really, like it's preventing us from understanding,\n\n58:40.320 --> 58:42.360\n you know, the real problem there,\n\n58:42.360 --> 58:44.940\n which is that lean supply chain.\n\n58:44.940 --> 58:46.800\n Sure, there was some panic buying, you know,\n\n58:46.800 --> 58:47.920\n no doubt about it,\n\n58:47.920 --> 58:51.840\n but we had an enormous shift in people's behavior.\n\n58:51.840 --> 58:55.320\n So with my sister and brother in law,\n\n58:55.320 --> 58:58.560\n I own a couple of small businesses and we serve food, right?\n\n58:58.560 --> 59:01.540\n So we get, you know, food from Cisco.\n\n59:02.760 --> 59:04.720\n Cisco couldn't get rid of food, right?\n\n59:04.720 --> 59:05.960\n Because nobody's eating out.\n\n59:05.960 --> 59:09.520\n So they've got, you know, 50 pounds sacks of flour,\n\n59:09.520 --> 59:11.080\n you know, sitting in their warehouse\n\n59:11.080 --> 59:11.920\n that they can't get rid of.\n\n59:11.920 --> 59:14.960\n They've got cases of lettuce and meat and everything else\n\n59:14.960 --> 59:16.220\n that's just gonna go bad.\n\n59:17.360 --> 59:20.800\n So that panic buying certainly exacerbated some things\n\n59:20.800 --> 59:22.000\n like toilet paper and whatever,\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:25.640\n but we saw just a massive change in demand.\n\n59:25.640 --> 59:28.760\n And our supply chains are based on historical data, right?\n\n59:28.760 --> 59:31.440\n So, you know, that stuff leaves Asia,\n\n59:31.440 --> 59:34.480\n you know, months before you wanna have it on the shelves\n\n59:34.480 --> 59:37.000\n and you're predicting based on last year, you know,\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.820\n what you want on that shelf.\n\n59:39.820 --> 59:43.280\n And so it's a, you know, I guess at its best,\n\n59:43.280 --> 59:47.000\n it's a beautiful symphony of lots of moving parts,\n\n59:48.520 --> 59:52.760\n but now everyone can't get on the same page of music.\n\n59:52.760 --> 59:54.440\n But it's not resilient to changes\n\n59:54.440 --> 59:59.440\n in on mass human behavior.\n\n59:59.520 --> 1:00:03.400\n So even like I read somewhere,\n\n1:00:03.400 --> 1:00:06.400\n maybe you can tell me if it's true in relation to food,\n\n1:00:06.400 --> 1:00:08.280\n it's just the change of human behavior\n\n1:00:08.280 --> 1:00:11.880\n between going out to restaurants versus eating at home.\n\n1:00:11.880 --> 1:00:15.520\n As a species, we consume a lot less food that way.\n\n1:00:15.520 --> 1:00:18.440\n Apparently what I read in restaurants,\n\n1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:20.600\n like there's a lot of food just thrown out.\n\n1:00:20.600 --> 1:00:23.080\n It's part of the business model.\n\n1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:26.200\n And so like you then have to move a lot more food\n\n1:00:26.200 --> 1:00:28.040\n through the whole supply chain.\n\n1:00:28.040 --> 1:00:31.560\n And now because you're consuming, you know,\n\n1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:32.900\n there's leftovers at home,\n\n1:00:32.900 --> 1:00:37.160\n you're consuming much more of the food you're getting\n\n1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:38.620\n when you're eating at home,\n\n1:00:38.620 --> 1:00:41.000\n that's creating these bottleneck situations,\n\n1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:42.540\n problems as you're referring to,\n\n1:00:42.540 --> 1:00:45.240\n too much in a certain place, not enough in another place.\n\n1:00:45.240 --> 1:00:47.880\n And it's just the supply chain is not robust\n\n1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:52.880\n those kinds of dynamic shifts in who gets what where.\n\n1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:54.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:54.140 --> 1:00:57.440\n Yeah, I mean, so, and I have worked in agriculture a bit\n\n1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:01.200\n on sort of the supply side, you know,\n\n1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:03.120\n and there are product categories, right?\n\n1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:07.440\n Where 30% of the crop raised does not get used, right?\n\n1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:09.960\n Just gets plowed under or wasted.\n\n1:01:09.960 --> 1:01:12.200\n But here's the importance of this\n\n1:01:12.200 --> 1:01:14.440\n in sort of getting this right, you know, like that,\n\n1:01:14.440 --> 1:01:16.540\n not that like panic buying, you know,\n\n1:01:16.540 --> 1:01:18.960\n blame the irrational consumer, you know,\n\n1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:21.240\n look at the hard sort of truth\n\n1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:24.240\n of the way we've set up our economy.\n\n1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:29.240\n And I'll ask you this, Lex, I know you're a hopeful,\n\n1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:30.600\n optimistic person.\n\n1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:31.940\n 100%, yes.\n\n1:01:31.940 --> 1:01:32.960\n Yeah, I am too.\n\n1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:34.800\n I mean, I write about problems all the time.\n\n1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:36.560\n And so people think I'm sort of like a,\n\n1:01:36.560 --> 1:01:39.960\n just a Debbie Downer, you know, pessimist,\n\n1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:43.080\n but I'm a glass half full kind of guy.\n\n1:01:43.080 --> 1:01:47.360\n Like I want to identify problems so we can solve them.\n\n1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:48.340\n So let me ask you this,\n\n1:01:48.340 --> 1:01:52.020\n we've got these long lean supply chains.\n\n1:01:52.020 --> 1:01:57.020\n In the future, do you see more environmental problems\n\n1:01:57.020 --> 1:02:00.480\n that could disrupt them,\n\n1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:05.480\n more geopolitical problems that could disrupt trade\n\n1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:10.560\n from Asia, you know, other institutional failures?\n\n1:02:10.920 --> 1:02:13.840\n Do those things seem, you know,\n\n1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:16.280\n potentially more likely in the future\n\n1:02:16.280 --> 1:02:18.640\n than they have been in say the last 20 years?\n\n1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:21.860\n Yeah, it almost absolutely seems to be the case.\n\n1:02:21.860 --> 1:02:24.400\n So you then have to ask the question of\n\n1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:28.960\n how do we change our supply chains?\n\n1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:31.040\n Whether it's making more resilient\n\n1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:34.140\n or make them less densely connected,\n\n1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:38.760\n you know, building a, it's like a, what is it?\n\n1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:43.400\n You know, the Tesla model for in the automotive sector\n\n1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:45.040\n of like trying to build everything,\n\n1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:48.600\n like trying to get the factory to do as much as possible\n\n1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:53.480\n with as little reliance on widely distributed sources\n\n1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:55.000\n of the supply chain as possible.\n\n1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:58.640\n So maybe like rethinking how much we rely\n\n1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:00.840\n on the infrastructure of the supply chain.\n\n1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:03.760\n Yeah, I mean, you know, there's some basic,\n\n1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:08.160\n and I assume, right, that there are a lot of folks\n\n1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:10.600\n in corporate boardrooms looking at risk\n\n1:03:10.600 --> 1:03:13.080\n and saying that didn't go well,\n\n1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:15.140\n and maybe it could have even gone worse.\n\n1:03:16.500 --> 1:03:19.720\n Maybe we need to think about reshoring, right?\n\n1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:22.760\n At the very least, one of the things\n\n1:03:22.760 --> 1:03:24.120\n that I'm hearing about anecdotally\n\n1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:26.320\n is that they're starting stuff up, you know,\n\n1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:28.080\n when they can, right?\n\n1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:31.360\n Which is, that's probably not sustainable, right?\n\n1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:34.080\n I mean, at some point, somebody in that corporate boardroom\n\n1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:36.660\n is gonna say, you know, guys, inventory is getting\n\n1:03:36.660 --> 1:03:38.160\n kind of heavy and the cost of that is like,\n\n1:03:38.160 --> 1:03:40.040\n do we, can we really justify that much longer\n\n1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:41.780\n to the shareholders, right?\n\n1:03:41.780 --> 1:03:43.560\n We can back off and start, you know,\n\n1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:45.520\n back, things are back to normal, let's lean out.\n\n1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:48.400\n Well, my hope is that there's a technology solution\n\n1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:49.600\n to a lot of aspects of this.\n\n1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:51.440\n So one of them on the supply chain side\n\n1:03:51.440 --> 1:03:53.080\n is collecting a lot more data,\n\n1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:57.040\n like having much more integrated\n\n1:03:57.040 --> 1:03:59.380\n and accurate representation of the inventory\n\n1:03:59.380 --> 1:04:00.680\n all over the place,\n\n1:04:00.680 --> 1:04:03.400\n and the available transportation mechanisms,\n\n1:04:03.400 --> 1:04:06.080\n the trucks, the all kinds of freight,\n\n1:04:06.080 --> 1:04:08.660\n and how in the different models\n\n1:04:08.660 --> 1:04:13.240\n of the possible catastrophes that can happen,\n\n1:04:14.660 --> 1:04:15.960\n like how will the system respond?\n\n1:04:15.960 --> 1:04:19.300\n So having a really solid model that you're operating under\n\n1:04:19.300 --> 1:04:23.500\n as opposed to just kind of being in emergency response mode\n\n1:04:23.500 --> 1:04:26.160\n under poor, incomplete information,\n\n1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:30.480\n which is what seems like is more commonly the case,\n\n1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:34.100\n except for things like you said, Walmart and Amazon,\n\n1:04:34.100 --> 1:04:36.740\n they're trying to internally get their stuff together\n\n1:04:36.740 --> 1:04:38.640\n on that front, but that doesn't help\n\n1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:40.240\n the rest of the economy.\n\n1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:44.920\n So another exciting technological development\n\n1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:48.080\n as you write about, as you think about is autonomous trucks.\n\n1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:52.320\n So these are often brought up in different contexts\n\n1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:57.320\n as the examples of AI and robots taking our jobs.\n\n1:04:57.440 --> 1:04:58.720\n How true is this?\n\n1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:00.300\n Should we be concerned?\n\n1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:03.760\n I think they've really come to epitomize\n\n1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:06.400\n this anxiety over automation, right?\n\n1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:09.560\n It's such a simple idea, right?\n\n1:05:09.560 --> 1:05:11.800\n Truck that drives itself,\n\n1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:15.240\n classic blue collar job that pays well,\n\n1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:20.240\n guy maybe with not a lot of other good options, right?\n\n1:05:20.440 --> 1:05:22.840\n To sort of make that same income easily,\n\n1:05:23.720 --> 1:05:27.380\n and you build a robot to take his job away, right?\n\n1:05:28.700 --> 1:05:32.420\n So I think 2016 or so,\n\n1:05:32.420 --> 1:05:35.280\n that was the sort of big question out there,\n\n1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:38.380\n and that's actually how I started studying it, right?\n\n1:05:38.380 --> 1:05:40.080\n I just wrapped up the book,\n\n1:05:40.080 --> 1:05:43.200\n just so happened that somebody was working at Uber,\n\n1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:45.760\n Uber had just bought auto, saw the book and was like,\n\n1:05:45.760 --> 1:05:48.840\n hey, can you come out and talk to our engineering teams\n\n1:05:48.840 --> 1:05:51.760\n about what life is like for truck drivers\n\n1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:54.700\n and maybe how our technology could make it better.\n\n1:05:54.700 --> 1:05:58.620\n And at that time, there were a lot of different ideas\n\n1:05:58.620 --> 1:06:00.220\n about how they were gonna play out, right?\n\n1:06:00.220 --> 1:06:03.400\n So while the press was saying,\n\n1:06:03.400 --> 1:06:05.280\n all truckers are gonna lose their jobs,\n\n1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:08.120\n there were a lot of people in these engineering teams\n\n1:06:08.120 --> 1:06:11.240\n who thought, okay, if we've got an individual owner operator\n\n1:06:11.240 --> 1:06:15.920\n and they can only drive eight or 10 hours a day,\n\n1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:19.880\n they hop in the back, they get their rest,\n\n1:06:19.880 --> 1:06:23.000\n and the asset that they own works for them, right?\n\n1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:24.740\n Sort of perfect, right?\n\n1:06:25.800 --> 1:06:28.620\n And at that time, there were a bunch of reports\n\n1:06:28.620 --> 1:06:30.480\n that came out and sort of basically what people did\n\n1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:33.080\n was they took the category of truck driver.\n\n1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:35.840\n Some people took a larger category from BLS\n\n1:06:35.840 --> 1:06:37.640\n of sales and delivery workers\n\n1:06:37.640 --> 1:06:40.180\n that was about three and a half million workers\n\n1:06:40.180 --> 1:06:43.560\n and others took the heavy duty truck driver category,\n\n1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:46.720\n which was at the time about 1.8 million or so.\n\n1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:49.400\n And they picked a start date and a slope\n\n1:06:49.400 --> 1:06:52.280\n and said, let's assume that all these jobs\n\n1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:53.480\n are just gonna disappear.\n\n1:06:53.480 --> 1:06:57.560\n And really smart researcher, Annette Bernhardt\n\n1:06:57.560 --> 1:07:00.680\n at the Labor Center at UC Berkeley\n\n1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:03.720\n was sort of looking around for people\n\n1:07:03.720 --> 1:07:06.600\n who were sort of deeply into industries\n\n1:07:06.600 --> 1:07:10.240\n to complicate those analyses, right?\n\n1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:11.660\n And reached out to me and was like,\n\n1:07:11.660 --> 1:07:12.540\n what do you think of this?\n\n1:07:12.540 --> 1:07:15.240\n And I said, the industry is super diverse.\n\n1:07:15.240 --> 1:07:17.920\n I haven't given a ton of thought, but it can't be that.\n\n1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:21.200\n It's not that simple, it never is.\n\n1:07:21.200 --> 1:07:23.800\n And so she was like, will you do this?\n\n1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:26.280\n And I was like ready to move on to another topic.\n\n1:07:26.280 --> 1:07:28.720\n I had like been in trucking for 10 years\n\n1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:31.000\n and that's how I started looking at it.\n\n1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.640\n And it is, it's a lot more complicated.\n\n1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:38.560\n And the initial impacts, and here's the challenge I think,\n\n1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:40.640\n and it's not just a research challenge,\n\n1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:43.600\n it's the fundamental public policy challenge\n\n1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:46.920\n is we look at the existing industry\n\n1:07:46.920 --> 1:07:50.040\n and the impacts, the potential impacts,\n\n1:07:50.040 --> 1:07:53.040\n they're not, you know, nothing.\n\n1:07:53.040 --> 1:07:56.240\n For some communities and some kinds of drivers,\n\n1:07:56.240 --> 1:07:57.200\n they're gonna be hard.\n\n1:07:57.200 --> 1:07:59.280\n And there are a significant number of them.\n\n1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:00.920\n Nowhere near what people thought.\n\n1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:04.280\n You know, I estimate it's like around 300,000,\n\n1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:08.060\n but that's a static picture of the existing industry.\n\n1:08:08.060 --> 1:08:13.060\n And here's the key with this is, at least in my conclusion\n\n1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:17.060\n is this is a transformative technology.\n\n1:08:17.060 --> 1:08:20.860\n We are not going to swap in self driving trucks\n\n1:08:20.860 --> 1:08:24.200\n for human driven trucks and all else stays the same.\n\n1:08:24.200 --> 1:08:27.420\n This is gonna reshape our supply chains.\n\n1:08:27.420 --> 1:08:29.360\n It's gonna reshape landscapes.\n\n1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:32.440\n It's gonna affect our ability to fight climate change.\n\n1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:37.680\n This is a really important technology in this space.\n\n1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:40.140\n Do you think it's possible to predict the future\n\n1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:44.400\n of the kind of opportunities it will create,\n\n1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:46.720\n how it will change the world?\n\n1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:48.520\n So like when you have the internet,\n\n1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:53.120\n you can start saying like all the kinds of ways\n\n1:08:53.120 --> 1:08:55.420\n that office work, all jobs will be lost\n\n1:08:55.420 --> 1:08:57.040\n because it's easy to network.\n\n1:08:57.040 --> 1:08:59.760\n And then software engineering allows you to automate\n\n1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:03.320\n a lot of the tasks like Microsoft Excel does, you know.\n\n1:09:04.800 --> 1:09:08.040\n But it opened up so many opportunities,\n\n1:09:08.040 --> 1:09:10.220\n even with things that are difficult to imagine,\n\n1:09:10.220 --> 1:09:12.680\n like with the internet, I don't know, Wikipedia,\n\n1:09:12.680 --> 1:09:15.920\n which is widely making accessible information.\n\n1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:20.920\n And that increased the general education globally by a lot,\n\n1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:22.760\n all those kinds of things.\n\n1:09:22.760 --> 1:09:25.400\n And then the ripple effects of that\n\n1:09:25.400 --> 1:09:29.080\n in terms of your ability to find other jobs\n\n1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:31.000\n is probably immeasurable.\n\n1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.720\n So is it just a hopeless pursuit to try to predict\n\n1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.480\n if you talk about these six different trajectories\n\n1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:44.360\n that we might take in automating trucks,\n\n1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:47.660\n but like as a result of taking those trajectories,\n\n1:09:47.660 --> 1:09:49.180\n is it a hopeless pursuit to predict\n\n1:09:49.180 --> 1:09:50.840\n what the future will result in?\n\n1:09:50.840 --> 1:09:52.160\n Yeah, it is.\n\n1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:54.680\n It absolutely is.\n\n1:09:54.680 --> 1:09:56.900\n Because it's the wrong question.\n\n1:09:56.900 --> 1:09:59.280\n The question is, what do we want the future to be\n\n1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:01.960\n and let's shape it, right?\n\n1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:06.000\n And I think this is, and this is the only point\n\n1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.360\n that I really wanna make in my work\n\n1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:10.240\n for the foreseeable future,\n\n1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:15.240\n is that we have got to get out of this mindset\n\n1:10:16.500 --> 1:10:20.400\n that we're just gonna let technology kind of go\n\n1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:22.520\n and it's a natural process and whatever pops out\n\n1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:24.360\n will fix the problems on the backside.\n\n1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:28.160\n And we've got to recognize that one,\n\n1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:30.920\n that's not what we do, right?\n\n1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:33.320\n You know, and self driving vehicles\n\n1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:35.120\n is just such a perfect example, right?\n\n1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:37.200\n We would not be sitting here today\n\n1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:38.520\n if the Defense Department, right?\n\n1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:43.520\n If Congress in 2000 had not written into legislation\n\n1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:46.760\n funding for the DARPA challenges,\n\n1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:49.080\n which followed, actually I think the funding came\n\n1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:50.060\n a couple of years later,\n\n1:10:50.060 --> 1:10:52.040\n but the priority that they wrote in 2000\n\n1:10:52.040 --> 1:10:55.540\n was let's get a third of all ground vehicles\n\n1:10:55.540 --> 1:10:58.440\n in our military forces unmanned, right?\n\n1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:01.440\n And this was before aerial unmanned vehicles\n\n1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:02.840\n had really sort of proven their worth.\n\n1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:04.480\n They would come to be incredibly,\n\n1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:07.880\n like, you know, just blow people's minds\n\n1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:09.760\n in terms of their additional capabilities,\n\n1:11:09.760 --> 1:11:10.880\n the lower costs, you know,\n\n1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:13.680\n keeping soldiers out of harm's way.\n\n1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:15.480\n Now, of course they raised other problems\n\n1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:17.640\n and considerations that I think we're still wrestling with,\n\n1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:21.140\n but that was even before that they had this priority.\n\n1:11:21.140 --> 1:11:22.720\n We would not be sitting here today\n\n1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:26.500\n if Congress in 2000 had not said, let's bring this about.\n\n1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:29.080\n So they already had that vision, actually.\n\n1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:30.020\n I didn't know about that.\n\n1:11:30.020 --> 1:11:32.700\n So for people who don't know the DARPA challenges\n\n1:11:32.700 --> 1:11:36.320\n is the events that were just kind of like\n\n1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:39.640\n these seemingly small scale challenges\n\n1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:41.800\n that brought together some of the smartest roboticists\n\n1:11:41.800 --> 1:11:45.480\n in the world, and that somehow created enough of a magic\n\n1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:49.000\n where ideas flourished,\n\n1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.600\n both engineering and scientific,\n\n1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:54.700\n that eventually then was the catalyst\n\n1:11:54.700 --> 1:11:56.320\n for creating all these different companies\n\n1:11:56.320 --> 1:11:57.200\n that took on the challenge.\n\n1:11:57.200 --> 1:11:58.800\n Some failed, some succeeded,\n\n1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:01.040\n some are still fighting the good fight.\n\n1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:03.440\n And that somehow just that little bit of challenge\n\n1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:07.420\n was the essential spark of progress\n\n1:12:07.420 --> 1:12:10.840\n that now resulted in this beautiful up and down wave\n\n1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:15.180\n of hype and profit and all this kind of weird dance\n\n1:12:15.180 --> 1:12:18.080\n where the B word, billions of dollars\n\n1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:21.120\n have been thrown around and we still don't know.\n\n1:12:21.120 --> 1:12:23.380\n And the T word, trillions of dollars\n\n1:12:23.380 --> 1:12:25.700\n in terms of transformative effects of autonomous vehicles.\n\n1:12:25.700 --> 1:12:27.360\n And all that started from DARPA\n\n1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:31.320\n and that initial vision of, I guess, as you're saying,\n\n1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:35.320\n of automating part of the military supply chain.\n\n1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:36.240\n I did not know that.\n\n1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:37.080\n That's interesting.\n\n1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:39.940\n So they had the same kind of vision for the military\n\n1:12:39.940 --> 1:12:43.340\n as we're not talking about a vision for the civilian,\n\n1:12:43.340 --> 1:12:45.740\n whether it's trucking or whether it's autonomous vehicle,\n\n1:12:45.740 --> 1:12:48.400\n sort of a ride sharing kind of application.\n\n1:12:48.400 --> 1:12:51.880\n Yeah, I mean, what an incredible spark, right?\n\n1:12:53.100 --> 1:12:57.760\n And just the story of what it produced, right?\n\n1:12:57.760 --> 1:13:01.260\n I mean, your own work on self driving, right?\n\n1:13:01.260 --> 1:13:04.120\n I mean, you've studied it as an academic, right?\n\n1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:08.460\n How many great researchers and minds have been harnessed\n\n1:13:08.460 --> 1:13:11.340\n by this outcome of that spark, right?\n\n1:13:11.340 --> 1:13:14.200\n And I think this is sort of theoretically about technology,\n\n1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:15.920\n right, this is what makes it sort of so great\n\n1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:18.480\n is that this is what makes us human, in my opinion, right?\n\n1:13:18.480 --> 1:13:21.360\n Is that you conceive of something in your mind\n\n1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:23.580\n and then you bring it into reality, right?\n\n1:13:23.580 --> 1:13:26.560\n I mean, that's what is so great about it.\n\n1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:29.880\n Sometimes you're too dumb to realize how difficult it is\n\n1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:30.720\n so you take it.\n\n1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:31.960\n Right.\n\n1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:36.760\n And then eventually you're in too deep.\n\n1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:38.760\n You might as well solve the problem.\n\n1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:41.360\n Well, and maybe we're in that situation right now\n\n1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:42.320\n with self driving.\n\n1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:44.320\n But, you know, and so let me throw this out there.\n\n1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:46.340\n I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on it.\n\n1:13:46.340 --> 1:13:50.160\n But truck drivers always ask me, like, is this for real?\n\n1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:52.840\n Like, is this really, like, it's harder than they think,\n\n1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:55.760\n like, right, and they can't really do this.\n\n1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:59.320\n And, you know, at first I was like, look, you know,\n\n1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:01.560\n this is like the defense department\n\n1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:04.320\n and like basically the top computer science\n\n1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:07.740\n and robotics departments in the world.\n\n1:14:07.740 --> 1:14:12.740\n And now Silicon Valley with billions of dollars in funding\n\n1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:17.380\n and just, you know, some of the smartest, hardest working,\n\n1:14:17.380 --> 1:14:21.200\n most visionary people focused on what is clearly,\n\n1:14:21.200 --> 1:14:24.660\n you know, a gigantic market, right?\n\n1:14:24.660 --> 1:14:26.780\n And what I tell them is like,\n\n1:14:26.780 --> 1:14:31.200\n if self driving vehicles don't happen,\n\n1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:34.640\n I think this will be the biggest technology failure story\n\n1:14:34.640 --> 1:14:35.680\n in human history.\n\n1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:39.880\n I don't know of anything else that is just galvanized.\n\n1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:42.800\n I mean, you've had people in garages or weird inventors\n\n1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:44.960\n work on things their whole lives and come really close\n\n1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:48.140\n and it never happens and it's a great failure story, right?\n\n1:14:48.140 --> 1:14:50.320\n But never have we had like whole,\n\n1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:53.040\n I mean, we're talking about GM, right?\n\n1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:55.840\n And these are not, you know, these are not tech companies,\n\n1:14:55.840 --> 1:14:58.200\n right, these are industrial giants, right?\n\n1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:00.440\n What were in the 20th century,\n\n1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:03.240\n the pinnacle of industrial production in the world\n\n1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:05.280\n in human history, right?\n\n1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:07.280\n And they're focused on it now.\n\n1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:11.320\n So if we don't pull this off, it's like, wow.\n\n1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:12.560\n It's fascinating to think about.\n\n1:15:12.560 --> 1:15:14.500\n I've never thought of it that way.\n\n1:15:14.500 --> 1:15:18.400\n There was a mass hysteria on a level\n\n1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:20.640\n in terms of excitement and hype\n\n1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:23.640\n on a level that's probably unparalleled in technology space.\n\n1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:26.400\n Like I've seen that kind of hysteria just studying history\n\n1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:28.740\n when you talk about military conflict.\n\n1:15:28.740 --> 1:15:32.680\n So we often wage war with a dream of making a better world\n\n1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:34.800\n and then realize it costs trillions of dollars\n\n1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:37.800\n and then we step back and like, and go, wait a minute,\n\n1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:40.120\n what do we actually get for this?\n\n1:15:40.120 --> 1:15:41.600\n But in the space of technology,\n\n1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:44.080\n it seems like all these kinds of large efforts\n\n1:15:44.080 --> 1:15:45.620\n have paid off.\n\n1:15:45.620 --> 1:15:47.100\n This, you're right.\n\n1:15:47.100 --> 1:15:51.360\n It seems like, it seems like even GM and Ford\n\n1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:54.520\n and all these companies now are a little bit like,\n\n1:15:54.520 --> 1:15:58.720\n hey, or Toyota and even Tesla,\n\n1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:01.800\n like, are we sure about this?\n\n1:16:01.800 --> 1:16:02.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:04.320\n And it's fascinating to think about\n\n1:16:04.320 --> 1:16:06.100\n when you tell the story of this,\n\n1:16:06.100 --> 1:16:10.120\n this could be one of the big first, perhaps,\n\n1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:14.120\n but by far the biggest failures of the dream\n\n1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:16.200\n in the space of technology.\n\n1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:17.880\n That's really interesting to think about.\n\n1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:19.840\n I was a skeptic for a long time\n\n1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:22.880\n because of the human factor.\n\n1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:25.160\n Because for business to work in the space,\n\n1:16:25.160 --> 1:16:26.320\n you have to work with humans\n\n1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:29.240\n and you have to work with humans at every level.\n\n1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:30.520\n So in the truck driving space,\n\n1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:32.480\n you have to work with the truck driver,\n\n1:16:32.480 --> 1:16:34.320\n but you also have to work with the society\n\n1:16:34.320 --> 1:16:37.000\n that has a certain conception of what driving means.\n\n1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:38.760\n And also you have to have work with businesses\n\n1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:43.760\n that are not used to this extreme level of technology,\n\n1:16:44.240 --> 1:16:48.620\n you know, in the basic operation of their business.\n\n1:16:48.620 --> 1:16:50.120\n So I thought it would be really difficult\n\n1:16:50.120 --> 1:16:53.160\n to move to autonomous vehicles in that way.\n\n1:16:53.160 --> 1:16:56.200\n But then I realized that there's certain companies\n\n1:16:56.200 --> 1:16:58.960\n that are just willing to take big risks\n\n1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:00.280\n and really innovate.\n\n1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:04.320\n I think the first impressive company to me was Waymo\n\n1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:07.000\n or what was used to be the Google self driving car.\n\n1:17:07.840 --> 1:17:11.080\n And I saw, okay, here's a company\n\n1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:13.480\n that's willing to really think longterm\n\n1:17:13.480 --> 1:17:17.240\n and really try to solve this problem, hire great engineers.\n\n1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:22.640\n Then I saw Tesla with Mobileye when they first had.\n\n1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:25.760\n I thought, actually Mobileye is the thing that impressed me.\n\n1:17:25.760 --> 1:17:27.160\n When I sat down, I thought,\n\n1:17:27.160 --> 1:17:28.400\n because I'm a computer vision person,\n\n1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:33.400\n I thought there's no way a system could keep me in lane\n\n1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:36.680\n long enough for it to be a pleasant experience for me.\n\n1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:38.120\n So from a computer vision perspective,\n\n1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:39.520\n I thought there'd be too many failures.\n\n1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:40.640\n It'd be really annoying.\n\n1:17:40.640 --> 1:17:42.280\n It'd be a gimmick, a toy.\n\n1:17:42.280 --> 1:17:44.840\n It wouldn't actually create a pleasant experience.\n\n1:17:44.840 --> 1:17:47.520\n And when I first was gotten Tesla with Mobileye,\n\n1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:49.080\n the initial Mobileye system,\n\n1:17:49.080 --> 1:17:52.560\n it actually held to lane for quite a long time\n\n1:17:52.560 --> 1:17:54.560\n to where I could relax a little bit.\n\n1:17:54.560 --> 1:17:56.080\n And it was a really pleasant experience.\n\n1:17:56.080 --> 1:17:58.600\n I couldn't exactly explain why it's pleasant\n\n1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:01.080\n because it's not like I still have to really pay attention,\n\n1:18:01.080 --> 1:18:03.200\n but I can relax my shoulders a little bit.\n\n1:18:05.440 --> 1:18:07.000\n I can look around a little bit more.\n\n1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:10.600\n And for some reason that was really reducing the stress.\n\n1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:15.000\n And then over time, Tesla with a lot of the revolutionary\n\n1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:17.400\n stuff they're doing on the machine learning space\n\n1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:22.000\n made me believe that there's opportunities here to innovate,\n\n1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:23.840\n to come up with totally new ideas.\n\n1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:27.720\n Another very sad story that I was really excited about\n\n1:18:27.720 --> 1:18:29.520\n is Cadillac SuperCruise system.\n\n1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:32.880\n It is a sad story because I think I vaguely read in the news\n\n1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:36.120\n they just said they're discontinuing SuperCruise,\n\n1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:39.040\n but it's a nice innovative way\n\n1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:41.320\n of doing driver attention monitoring\n\n1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:43.280\n and also doing lane keeping.\n\n1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:45.680\n And it just innovation could solve this\n\n1:18:45.680 --> 1:18:47.360\n in ways we don't predict.\n\n1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:49.600\n And same with in the trucking space,\n\n1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:52.760\n it might not be as simple as like journalists envision\n\n1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:55.680\n a few years ago, where everything's just automated.\n\n1:18:55.680 --> 1:19:00.120\n It might be gradually helping out the truck driver\n\n1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:03.360\n in some ways that make their life more efficient,\n\n1:19:03.360 --> 1:19:05.920\n more effective, more pleasant,\n\n1:19:07.720 --> 1:19:09.240\n remove some of the inefficiencies\n\n1:19:09.240 --> 1:19:12.520\n that we've been talking about in totally innovative ways.\n\n1:19:12.520 --> 1:19:14.840\n And that I still have that dream\n\n1:19:14.840 --> 1:19:18.680\n that I believe to solve the fully autonomous driving problem\n\n1:19:18.680 --> 1:19:20.400\n we're still many years away,\n\n1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:22.880\n but on the way to solving that problem,\n\n1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:25.040\n it feels like there could be,\n\n1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:29.400\n if there's bold risk takers and innovators in this space,\n\n1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:30.760\n there's an opportunity to come up\n\n1:19:30.760 --> 1:19:35.760\n with like subtle technologies that make all the difference.\n\n1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:38.840\n That's actually just what I realized\n\n1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:41.400\n is sometimes little design decisions\n\n1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:42.920\n make all the difference.\n\n1:19:42.920 --> 1:19:45.080\n It's the Blackberry versus the iPhone.\n\n1:19:45.080 --> 1:19:50.080\n Why is it that you have a glass and you're using your finger\n\n1:19:50.760 --> 1:19:52.800\n for all of the work versus the buttons\n\n1:19:52.800 --> 1:19:54.280\n makes all the difference.\n\n1:19:54.280 --> 1:19:57.200\n This idea that now that you have a giant screen\n\n1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:00.120\n so that every part of the experience\n\n1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:01.960\n is now a digital experience.\n\n1:20:01.960 --> 1:20:05.040\n So you can have things like apps that change everything.\n\n1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:07.600\n You can't, when you first thinking about\n\n1:20:07.600 --> 1:20:10.120\n do I want a keyboard or not on a smartphone,\n\n1:20:10.120 --> 1:20:13.360\n you think it's just the keyboard decision.\n\n1:20:13.360 --> 1:20:17.840\n But then you later realize by removing the keyboard,\n\n1:20:17.840 --> 1:20:21.920\n you're enabling a whole ecosystem of technologies\n\n1:20:21.920 --> 1:20:23.120\n that are inside the phone.\n\n1:20:23.120 --> 1:20:25.480\n And now you're making the smartphone into a computer.\n\n1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:27.360\n And that same way,\n\n1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:30.480\n who knows how you can transform trucks, right?\n\n1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:32.520\n By like automating some parts of it,\n\n1:20:32.520 --> 1:20:36.480\n maybe adding some displays,\n\n1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:37.640\n maybe allows you to,\n\n1:20:37.640 --> 1:20:40.840\n maybe giving the truck driver some control\n\n1:20:40.840 --> 1:20:43.160\n in the supply chain to make decisions\n\n1:20:43.160 --> 1:20:44.440\n all those kinds of things.\n\n1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:45.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:45.800 --> 1:20:46.960\n So, I don't know.\n\n1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:51.640\n So where are you on the spectrum of hope\n\n1:20:51.640 --> 1:20:55.280\n for the role of automation in trucking?\n\n1:20:56.960 --> 1:20:59.520\n I think automation is inevitable.\n\n1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:04.520\n And again, I think this is really going to be transformative\n\n1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:06.160\n and it's gonna be,\n\n1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:09.680\n I've studied the history of trucking technology\n\n1:21:09.680 --> 1:21:11.000\n as much as I can.\n\n1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:12.960\n There's not a lot of great stuff written\n\n1:21:12.960 --> 1:21:14.960\n and you kind of have to,\n\n1:21:14.960 --> 1:21:16.880\n there isn't a lot of data and places to know\n\n1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:19.240\n sort of volumes of stuff and how they're changing, et cetera.\n\n1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:24.240\n But the big revolutionary changes in trucking\n\n1:21:24.480 --> 1:21:27.960\n are because of constellations of factors.\n\n1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:29.640\n It's not just one thing, right?\n\n1:21:29.640 --> 1:21:32.040\n So Daimler builds a motorized truck\n\n1:21:32.040 --> 1:21:35.320\n and I think it's 1896, right?\n\n1:21:35.320 --> 1:21:37.560\n Intercity trucking.\n\n1:21:37.560 --> 1:21:39.080\n So basically what they use that truck for\n\n1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:41.800\n is just to swap out horses, right?\n\n1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:42.960\n They basically do the same thing.\n\n1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:45.960\n The service doesn't really change, you know?\n\n1:21:45.960 --> 1:21:48.760\n And then World War I really spurs the development\n\n1:21:48.760 --> 1:21:50.720\n of sort of bigger, larger trucks,\n\n1:21:50.720 --> 1:21:54.600\n like spreads air filled tires.\n\n1:21:54.600 --> 1:21:57.880\n And then we start paving roads, right?\n\n1:21:57.880 --> 1:22:00.440\n And paved roads, right?\n\n1:22:00.440 --> 1:22:04.440\n Air filled tires and the internal combustion engine.\n\n1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:05.720\n Now you got a winning mix.\n\n1:22:05.720 --> 1:22:09.360\n Now it met with demand for people who wanted to get out\n\n1:22:09.360 --> 1:22:12.160\n from under the thumb of the railroads, right?\n\n1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:14.680\n So there was all of this pent up demand\n\n1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:18.360\n to get cheaper freight from the countryside\n\n1:22:18.360 --> 1:22:20.760\n into cities and between cities\n\n1:22:20.760 --> 1:22:22.800\n that typically had to go by rail.\n\n1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:25.840\n And so now, you know, 40 years\n\n1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:28.320\n after that internal combustion engine,\n\n1:22:28.320 --> 1:22:30.960\n it becomes this absolutely essential, right?\n\n1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:34.320\n This necessary but not sufficient piece of technology\n\n1:22:34.320 --> 1:22:38.840\n to create the modern trucking industry in the 1930s.\n\n1:22:38.840 --> 1:22:41.600\n And I think self driving is gonna be,\n\n1:22:41.600 --> 1:22:43.600\n self driving trucks are gonna be part of that.\n\n1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:47.640\n And the idea, I guess we credit Jeff Bezos.\n\n1:22:47.640 --> 1:22:52.240\n The idea is, you know, okay, so Sam Walton,\n\n1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:54.000\n if we can do it like a slight tangent\n\n1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:57.000\n on sort of the importance of trucking to business strategy\n\n1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:59.520\n and sort of how it has transformed our world.\n\n1:23:00.760 --> 1:23:03.440\n The central insight that Sam Walton had\n\n1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:06.120\n that made him the giant that he was\n\n1:23:06.120 --> 1:23:10.440\n in influencing the way that so many people get stuff\n\n1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:12.560\n was a trucking insight.\n\n1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:17.560\n And so if you look at the way that he developed his system,\n\n1:23:17.840 --> 1:23:19.600\n you build a distribution center\n\n1:23:19.600 --> 1:23:22.360\n and then you ring it with stores.\n\n1:23:22.360 --> 1:23:24.960\n Those stores are never further out\n\n1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:26.200\n from that distribution center\n\n1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:28.040\n than a human driven truck\n\n1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:30.800\n can drive back and forth in one day.\n\n1:23:31.760 --> 1:23:34.880\n And so rather than the way all of his competitors\n\n1:23:34.880 --> 1:23:37.920\n were doing it with sending trucks all over the place\n\n1:23:37.920 --> 1:23:39.480\n and having people sleep overnight\n\n1:23:39.480 --> 1:23:43.240\n and sort of making the trucking service fit\n\n1:23:43.240 --> 1:23:45.200\n where they had stores,\n\n1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:48.280\n he designed the layout of the stores\n\n1:23:49.320 --> 1:23:51.360\n to fit what trucks could do.\n\n1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:53.920\n And so transportation and logistics\n\n1:23:53.920 --> 1:23:57.320\n become Walmart's edge\n\n1:23:57.320 --> 1:23:59.360\n and allows them to dominate the space.\n\n1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:02.040\n That's the challenge that Amazon has now.\n\n1:24:02.040 --> 1:24:05.720\n They've mastered the digital part of it.\n\n1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:07.480\n And now they got to figure out\n\n1:24:07.480 --> 1:24:11.600\n how do we dominate the actual physical movement\n\n1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:14.240\n that complements that.\n\n1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:16.680\n Others are obviously gonna follow.\n\n1:24:16.680 --> 1:24:18.800\n But the capabilities of these trucks\n\n1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:20.440\n is completely different\n\n1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:22.840\n than the capability of a human driven truck.\n\n1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:25.760\n So if you're Smith packing\n\n1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:30.240\n and you've got a bunch of meat in a warehouse\n\n1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:33.800\n and it's going to grocery distribution centers,\n\n1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:37.280\n you have that trucker probably come in the night before\n\n1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:38.360\n and you make him wait\n\n1:24:38.360 --> 1:24:41.440\n so that he has a full 10 hour break,\n\n1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:42.680\n which is what the law requires\n\n1:24:42.680 --> 1:24:45.680\n so that he can get to the furthest reaches\n\n1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:48.240\n that he can of one of those stores.\n\n1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:50.440\n So he can drive his full 11 hours\n\n1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:51.600\n and bring that meat\n\n1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:53.280\n so it doesn't have to sit overnight\n\n1:24:53.280 --> 1:24:55.480\n in that refrigerated trailer.\n\n1:24:55.480 --> 1:24:57.440\n And so their system is based on that.\n\n1:24:57.440 --> 1:25:00.680\n Now, what happens when that truck\n\n1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:04.120\n can now travel two times as far, right?\n\n1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:05.840\n Three times as far.\n\n1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:08.800\n Now you don't need the warehouses where they were.\n\n1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:11.680\n Now you can go super lean with your inventory.\n\n1:25:11.680 --> 1:25:14.440\n Instead of having meat here, meat there, meat there,\n\n1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:16.200\n you can put it all right here.\n\n1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:18.120\n And if it's cheap enough,\n\n1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:20.360\n substitute those transportation costs\n\n1:25:20.360 --> 1:25:22.400\n for all that warehousing costs, right?\n\n1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:24.680\n So this is gonna remake landscapes\n\n1:25:24.680 --> 1:25:29.240\n in the same way that big box supply chains did, right?\n\n1:25:29.240 --> 1:25:32.920\n And then of course, the further compliment of that is,\n\n1:25:32.920 --> 1:25:37.600\n how do you then get it to two people at their door, right?\n\n1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:39.480\n And the big box supply chain,\n\n1:25:39.480 --> 1:25:44.280\n it moves very few items in really large quantities\n\n1:25:44.280 --> 1:25:48.360\n to very few locations pretty slowly, right?\n\n1:25:49.440 --> 1:25:53.640\n Ecommerce aspires to do something completely different,\n\n1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:57.720\n move huge varieties of things in small quantities,\n\n1:25:57.720 --> 1:26:01.080\n virtually everywhere as fast as possible, right?\n\n1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:05.560\n And so that is like that intercity trucking\n\n1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:10.360\n under the, in the era of railroad monopolies, right?\n\n1:26:10.360 --> 1:26:14.240\n The demand for that is potentially enormous, right?\n\n1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:16.840\n And so there's such a,\n\n1:26:16.840 --> 1:26:20.400\n so right now I think a lot of the business plans\n\n1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:22.200\n for sort of automated trucks, right?\n\n1:26:22.200 --> 1:26:24.920\n And sort of the way that the journalistic accounts portray it\n\n1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:28.720\n is like, okay, if we swap out a human for a computer,\n\n1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:30.280\n what are the labor costs per mile?\n\n1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:31.800\n And like, oh, here's the profitability\n\n1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:34.200\n of self driving trucks, uh uh.\n\n1:26:34.200 --> 1:26:36.320\n Like this is transformative technology.\n\n1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:39.040\n We're gonna change the way we get stuff.\n\n1:26:39.040 --> 1:26:41.920\n So we could actually get a lot more trucks period\n\n1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:43.160\n with like with autonomous trucks\n\n1:26:43.160 --> 1:26:45.840\n because they would enable a very different kind\n\n1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:47.560\n of transportation networks you think.\n\n1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:50.240\n Yeah, here's, and this is where it's like, uh oh.\n\n1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:54.640\n Like, yeah, so we really thought\n\n1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:57.400\n we were gonna be electrifying trucks.\n\n1:26:57.400 --> 1:26:59.040\n If they're going twice as far,\n\n1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:01.480\n if they're moving three times as much,\n\n1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:03.320\n if they're going three times as far, right?\n\n1:27:03.320 --> 1:27:05.480\n What does that mean for how far we are\n\n1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:06.800\n behind on batteries, right?\n\n1:27:06.800 --> 1:27:09.360\n We've got sort of these, you know, ideas about like, man,\n\n1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:10.360\n we, you know, here's how far,\n\n1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:12.800\n how close we could get to meet this demand.\n\n1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:15.040\n That demand is gonna radically change, right?\n\n1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:17.720\n These trucks are, you know, so then we've got to think\n\n1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:20.720\n about, all right, if it's not batteries, you know,\n\n1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:22.600\n how are we powering these things?\n\n1:27:22.600 --> 1:27:25.280\n And how many of them are they're gonna be?\n\n1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:28.440\n Like right now we've got 5 million containers\n\n1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:33.440\n that move from LA and Long Beach to Chicago on rail.\n\n1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:38.520\n Rail is three or four times at least more efficient\n\n1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:42.600\n than trucks in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:45.720\n And on that lane, it varies a lot depending on demand,\n\n1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:50.040\n but maybe rail has a 20% advantage in cost, maybe 25%,\n\n1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:52.120\n but it's a couple of days slower.\n\n1:27:52.120 --> 1:27:54.600\n So now you cut the cost of that truck,\n\n1:27:54.600 --> 1:27:57.480\n transportation per mile by 30%.\n\n1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:00.640\n Now it's cheaper than rail and it gets the stuff there\n\n1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:02.520\n five days faster than rail.\n\n1:28:02.520 --> 1:28:05.640\n How many millions of containers are gonna leave LA\n\n1:28:05.640 --> 1:28:08.840\n and Long Beach on self driving trucks and go to Chicago?\n\n1:28:08.840 --> 1:28:10.920\n And it might look very much like a train\n\n1:28:10.920 --> 1:28:14.060\n if we go with the platooning solution,\n\n1:28:14.060 --> 1:28:18.540\n where you have these rows of like,\n\n1:28:18.540 --> 1:28:21.660\n imagine like rows of like 10, like dozens of trucks\n\n1:28:21.660 --> 1:28:25.180\n or like hundreds of trucks, like some absurd situation.\n\n1:28:25.180 --> 1:28:29.620\n Just going from LA to Chicago, just this train,\n\n1:28:29.620 --> 1:28:31.780\n but taking up a highway.\n\n1:28:31.780 --> 1:28:34.780\n I mean, this is probably a good place\n\n1:28:34.780 --> 1:28:37.980\n to talk about various scenarios.\n\n1:28:37.980 --> 1:28:39.300\n Well, before we get there,\n\n1:28:39.300 --> 1:28:41.740\n can I just make one interesting observation\n\n1:28:41.740 --> 1:28:44.820\n that I made as a driver?\n\n1:28:44.820 --> 1:28:46.620\n When you're in a truck, you're up higher.\n\n1:28:46.620 --> 1:28:50.020\n So you can see further and you can see the traffic patterns\n\n1:28:50.020 --> 1:28:54.140\n and cars move in packs.\n\n1:28:54.140 --> 1:28:56.460\n I'm sure there's academic research on this, right?\n\n1:28:56.460 --> 1:28:57.340\n But they move in packs.\n\n1:28:57.340 --> 1:28:59.620\n They kind of bunch up behind a slower car\n\n1:28:59.620 --> 1:29:01.200\n and then a bunch of them break free.\n\n1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:03.880\n And this is sort of on almost free flowing highways.\n\n1:29:03.880 --> 1:29:05.160\n They kind of move in packs\n\n1:29:05.160 --> 1:29:07.540\n and you can kind of see them in the truck.\n\n1:29:07.540 --> 1:29:09.220\n So, rather than platoons,\n\n1:29:09.220 --> 1:29:11.940\n we might have like hives of trucks, right?\n\n1:29:11.940 --> 1:29:13.940\n So you have like 20 trucks moving\n\n1:29:13.940 --> 1:29:15.900\n in some coordinated fashion, right?\n\n1:29:15.900 --> 1:29:18.440\n And then maybe the self driving cars are,\n\n1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:19.980\n cause people don't like to be around them\n\n1:29:19.980 --> 1:29:21.340\n or whatever it is, right?\n\n1:29:21.340 --> 1:29:24.080\n You might have a pod of 20 self driving cars\n\n1:29:24.080 --> 1:29:26.540\n sort of moving in a packet behind them.\n\n1:29:26.540 --> 1:29:28.840\n This is what, if the aliens came down\n\n1:29:28.840 --> 1:29:30.900\n or we're just observing cars,\n\n1:29:30.900 --> 1:29:34.620\n which is one of the sort of prevalent characteristics\n\n1:29:34.620 --> 1:29:37.340\n of human civilization is there seems to be these cars\n\n1:29:37.340 --> 1:29:40.260\n like moving around that would do this kind of analysis\n\n1:29:40.260 --> 1:29:42.480\n of like, huh, what's the interesting clustering\n\n1:29:42.480 --> 1:29:43.680\n of situations here,\n\n1:29:46.020 --> 1:29:48.660\n especially with autonomous vehicles, I like this.\n\n1:29:48.660 --> 1:29:52.180\n Okay, so what technologically speaking\n\n1:29:52.180 --> 1:29:55.200\n do you see are the different scenarios\n\n1:29:55.200 --> 1:29:58.120\n of increasing automation in trucks?\n\n1:29:58.120 --> 1:30:00.860\n What are some ideas that you think about?\n\n1:30:00.860 --> 1:30:04.840\n For the most part, I have no influence\n\n1:30:04.840 --> 1:30:06.360\n on sort of what these ideas were.\n\n1:30:06.360 --> 1:30:11.220\n So what the project was that I did was I said,\n\n1:30:11.220 --> 1:30:14.380\n technology is created by people, they solve for X\n\n1:30:14.380 --> 1:30:17.660\n and they have some conception of what they wanna do.\n\n1:30:17.660 --> 1:30:19.940\n And that's where we should start in sort of thinking\n\n1:30:19.940 --> 1:30:22.160\n about what the impacts might be.\n\n1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:25.200\n So I went and I talked to everybody I could find\n\n1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:28.620\n who was thinking about developing a self driving truck.\n\n1:30:28.620 --> 1:30:31.280\n And the question was essentially,\n\n1:30:31.280 --> 1:30:32.780\n what are you trying to build?\n\n1:30:32.780 --> 1:30:35.700\n Like, what do you envision this thing doing?\n\n1:30:35.700 --> 1:30:39.140\n It turned out that that for a lot of them\n\n1:30:39.140 --> 1:30:40.440\n was an afterthought.\n\n1:30:40.440 --> 1:30:43.780\n They knew the sort of technological capabilities\n\n1:30:43.780 --> 1:30:45.380\n that a self driving vehicle would have.\n\n1:30:45.380 --> 1:30:48.220\n And those were the problems that they were tackling.\n\n1:30:48.220 --> 1:30:50.300\n They were engineers and computer scientists and...\n\n1:30:50.300 --> 1:30:53.580\n Oh, robotics people, I love you so much.\n\n1:30:53.580 --> 1:30:56.700\n This is, I could talk forever about this,\n\n1:30:56.700 --> 1:30:58.300\n but yes, there's a technology problem,\n\n1:30:58.300 --> 1:30:59.700\n let's focus on that and we'll figure out\n\n1:30:59.700 --> 1:31:02.380\n the actual impact on society,\n\n1:31:02.380 --> 1:31:03.780\n how it's actually going to be applied,\n\n1:31:03.780 --> 1:31:05.600\n how it's actually going to be integrated\n\n1:31:05.600 --> 1:31:08.300\n from a policy and from a human perspective,\n\n1:31:08.300 --> 1:31:09.820\n from a business perspective later.\n\n1:31:09.820 --> 1:31:11.540\n First, let's solve the technology problem.\n\n1:31:11.540 --> 1:31:14.380\n That's not how life works, friends, but okay, I'm sorry.\n\n1:31:14.380 --> 1:31:16.180\n Yeah, yeah, so I mean,\n\n1:31:16.180 --> 1:31:18.060\n I'm sure you know the division of labor\n\n1:31:18.060 --> 1:31:18.980\n in these companies, right?\n\n1:31:18.980 --> 1:31:21.060\n There's sort of a business development side,\n\n1:31:21.060 --> 1:31:22.900\n you know, and then there's the engineering side, right?\n\n1:31:22.900 --> 1:31:24.420\n And the engineers are like, oh my God,\n\n1:31:24.420 --> 1:31:26.340\n what are these business development people, you know,\n\n1:31:26.340 --> 1:31:30.100\n why are they involved in this process?\n\n1:31:30.100 --> 1:31:34.420\n So I ended up sort of coming up with a few different ideas\n\n1:31:34.420 --> 1:31:36.980\n that people seem to be batting around\n\n1:31:36.980 --> 1:31:39.580\n and then really tried to zero in\n\n1:31:39.580 --> 1:31:42.700\n on a layman's understanding of the limitations, right?\n\n1:31:42.700 --> 1:31:47.500\n And it turns out that's really obvious and quite simple.\n\n1:31:47.500 --> 1:31:49.940\n Highway driving's a lot simpler, right?\n\n1:31:49.940 --> 1:31:53.580\n So, you know, the plan is simplify the problem, right?\n\n1:31:53.580 --> 1:31:56.180\n And focus on highways because city driving\n\n1:31:56.180 --> 1:31:59.820\n is so much more complicated.\n\n1:31:59.820 --> 1:32:04.260\n So from that, I came up with basically six scenarios,\n\n1:32:04.260 --> 1:32:06.620\n actually I came up with five\n\n1:32:06.620 --> 1:32:08.620\n that the developers were talking about.\n\n1:32:08.620 --> 1:32:11.380\n And then one that I thought was a good idea\n\n1:32:11.380 --> 1:32:16.380\n that I had read about, I think in like 2013 or 2014,\n\n1:32:16.820 --> 1:32:18.260\n which was actually something\n\n1:32:18.260 --> 1:32:20.500\n that the US military was looking at.\n\n1:32:20.500 --> 1:32:23.140\n I actually first heard about the idea\n\n1:32:23.140 --> 1:32:27.620\n of this kind of automation, at least in sketched out form\n\n1:32:27.620 --> 1:32:30.780\n in like 2011, I guess it was with Peloton,\n\n1:32:30.780 --> 1:32:33.940\n which was this sort of early technology entrant\n\n1:32:33.940 --> 1:32:35.940\n into the trucking industry,\n\n1:32:35.940 --> 1:32:39.220\n which was working on platooning trucks.\n\n1:32:39.220 --> 1:32:41.220\n And all they were doing was, you know,\n\n1:32:41.220 --> 1:32:43.100\n a cooperative adaptive cruise control\n\n1:32:43.100 --> 1:32:44.600\n as they came to call it.\n\n1:32:45.740 --> 1:32:48.240\n And we ended up on a panel together.\n\n1:32:48.240 --> 1:32:52.020\n And it's kind of interesting because I was on that panel\n\n1:32:52.020 --> 1:32:55.660\n because I was thinking about how we got the best return\n\n1:32:55.660 --> 1:32:58.380\n on investment for fuel efficient technologies.\n\n1:32:58.380 --> 1:33:01.180\n And if it's cool, I'll sort of set this up\n\n1:33:01.180 --> 1:33:03.500\n because it does, it comes into sort of the story\n\n1:33:03.500 --> 1:33:05.700\n of some of these scenarios.\n\n1:33:05.700 --> 1:33:09.260\n So when I studied the drivers,\n\n1:33:09.260 --> 1:33:14.260\n you had this like complete difference in the driving tasks,\n\n1:33:15.160 --> 1:33:16.260\n like we were talking about before\n\n1:33:16.260 --> 1:33:18.860\n with long haul and city, right?\n\n1:33:18.860 --> 1:33:21.500\n And you're not paid in the city,\n\n1:33:21.500 --> 1:33:24.500\n you've got congestion, the turns are tight.\n\n1:33:25.540 --> 1:33:27.900\n There's lots of, you know, pedestrians, you know,\n\n1:33:27.900 --> 1:33:29.900\n all the things that self driving trucks don't like,\n\n1:33:29.900 --> 1:33:31.920\n truckers don't like, right?\n\n1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:35.700\n And they're not paid, there's lots of waiting time.\n\n1:33:35.700 --> 1:33:37.900\n And then in the highway, they get to cruise,\n\n1:33:37.900 --> 1:33:39.780\n they're getting paid, they have control,\n\n1:33:39.780 --> 1:33:41.180\n they go at their own pace,\n\n1:33:41.180 --> 1:33:43.180\n they're making money, they're happy.\n\n1:33:43.180 --> 1:33:45.980\n Well, it turned out, I guess it was around 2010,\n\n1:33:45.980 --> 1:33:47.380\n this is still when we were thinking\n\n1:33:47.380 --> 1:33:48.980\n about regenerative braking, you know,\n\n1:33:48.980 --> 1:33:51.420\n and hybrid trucks being sort of like the solution.\n\n1:33:53.260 --> 1:33:56.140\n The problems with them sort of,\n\n1:33:56.140 --> 1:33:57.660\n and the advantages, you know,\n\n1:33:57.660 --> 1:33:59.380\n also split on what I was thinking of\n\n1:33:59.380 --> 1:34:01.660\n as kind of the rural urban divide at that time, right?\n\n1:34:01.660 --> 1:34:05.140\n So, like you got the regenerative braking, right?\n\n1:34:05.140 --> 1:34:06.540\n You can make the truck lighter,\n\n1:34:06.540 --> 1:34:08.420\n you can keep it local, right?\n\n1:34:08.420 --> 1:34:10.780\n You don't get any benefit from that, you know,\n\n1:34:10.780 --> 1:34:15.700\n hybrid electric on the rural highway,\n\n1:34:15.700 --> 1:34:17.940\n you want aerodynamics, right?\n\n1:34:17.940 --> 1:34:20.460\n There, you want low rolling resistance tires\n\n1:34:20.460 --> 1:34:23.140\n and these super aerodynamic sleek trucks, right?\n\n1:34:23.140 --> 1:34:26.220\n Where we know with off the shelf technology today,\n\n1:34:26.220 --> 1:34:27.820\n we could double the fuel economy,\n\n1:34:27.820 --> 1:34:30.380\n more than double the fuel economy of the typical truck\n\n1:34:30.380 --> 1:34:32.300\n in that highway segment,\n\n1:34:32.300 --> 1:34:34.620\n if we segmented the duty cycle, right?\n\n1:34:34.620 --> 1:34:36.580\n And so in the urban environment,\n\n1:34:36.580 --> 1:34:37.780\n you want a clean burning truck,\n\n1:34:37.780 --> 1:34:39.460\n so you're not giving kids asthma,\n\n1:34:39.460 --> 1:34:40.300\n you want it lighter,\n\n1:34:40.300 --> 1:34:45.140\n so it's not destroying those less strong pavements, right?\n\n1:34:45.140 --> 1:34:47.020\n You're not, you can make tighter turns,\n\n1:34:47.020 --> 1:34:48.360\n you don't need a sleeper cab,\n\n1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:49.260\n because the driver, you know,\n\n1:34:49.260 --> 1:34:51.260\n hopefully is getting home at night, right?\n\n1:34:51.260 --> 1:34:54.160\n In the long haul, you want that super aerodynamic stuff.\n\n1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:55.760\n Now that doesn't get you anything in the city,\n\n1:34:55.760 --> 1:34:57.360\n and in fact, it causes all kinds of problems,\n\n1:34:57.360 --> 1:34:58.540\n because you turn too tight,\n\n1:34:58.540 --> 1:35:00.060\n you crunch up all the aerodynamics\n\n1:35:00.060 --> 1:35:02.900\n that connect the tractor and the trailer.\n\n1:35:02.900 --> 1:35:05.820\n So the idea that I had was like, okay,\n\n1:35:05.820 --> 1:35:08.100\n what if we deliberately segmented it?\n\n1:35:08.100 --> 1:35:12.480\n Like, what if we created these droplets outside cities,\n\n1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:16.580\n where, you know, a local city driver who's paid by the hour\n\n1:35:16.580 --> 1:35:18.940\n kind of runs these trailers out once they're loaded,\n\n1:35:18.940 --> 1:35:20.780\n you know, doesn't sit there and wait while it's being loaded,\n\n1:35:20.780 --> 1:35:23.080\n they drop off a trailer, they go pick up one that's loaded,\n\n1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:25.140\n they run it out, when it's loaded, they call them,\n\n1:35:25.140 --> 1:35:27.260\n and they just run them out there and stage them.\n\n1:35:27.260 --> 1:35:30.180\n It's like an Uber driver, but for truckloads.\n\n1:35:30.180 --> 1:35:32.020\n Yeah, and we have like intermodal.\n\n1:35:32.020 --> 1:35:34.660\n We have like, basically this would be the equivalent\n\n1:35:34.660 --> 1:35:37.180\n of like rail to truck intermodal, right?\n\n1:35:37.180 --> 1:35:38.780\n So you put it on the rail, and then, you know,\n\n1:35:38.780 --> 1:35:40.500\n a trucker picks it up and delivers it, right?\n\n1:35:40.500 --> 1:35:42.140\n So instead of having the rail,\n\n1:35:42.140 --> 1:35:44.900\n you'd have these super aerodynamic, hopefully platoons,\n\n1:35:44.900 --> 1:35:48.780\n or what at the time was called long combination vehicles,\n\n1:35:48.780 --> 1:35:51.020\n which is basically two trailers connected together, right?\n\n1:35:51.020 --> 1:35:54.060\n Because this is like a huge productivity gain, right?\n\n1:35:54.060 --> 1:35:56.220\n And then instead of that driver like me,\n\n1:35:56.220 --> 1:35:57.740\n I would pick up something in upstate New York,\n\n1:35:57.740 --> 1:35:59.940\n drive to Michigan, drive to Alabama, you know,\n\n1:35:59.940 --> 1:36:01.820\n drive to Wisconsin, drive to Florida, you know,\n\n1:36:01.820 --> 1:36:03.180\n I'd get home every two weeks.\n\n1:36:03.180 --> 1:36:08.020\n If I'm just running that, you know, that double trailer,\n\n1:36:08.020 --> 1:36:09.540\n I might be able to go back and forth\n\n1:36:09.540 --> 1:36:11.680\n from Chicago to Detroit, right?\n\n1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:14.340\n Take two trailers there, pick up two trailers going back,\n\n1:36:14.340 --> 1:36:16.120\n right, and be home every night.\n\n1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:17.580\n Now, the problem with that at the time,\n\n1:36:17.580 --> 1:36:20.360\n or one of them was, you know, bridge weights.\n\n1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:23.080\n So you can't, not all bridges can handle\n\n1:36:23.080 --> 1:36:25.320\n that much weight on them.\n\n1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:26.620\n They can't handle these doubles, right?\n\n1:36:26.620 --> 1:36:28.560\n And some places can, some places can't.\n\n1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:31.660\n And so this platooning idea was happening at the same time,\n\n1:36:31.660 --> 1:36:33.220\n and we ended up on the same panel,\n\n1:36:33.220 --> 1:36:35.180\n and the founders were like,\n\n1:36:35.180 --> 1:36:37.420\n hey, so what's it like to follow\n\n1:36:37.420 --> 1:36:39.040\n really close behind another truck?\n\n1:36:39.040 --> 1:36:41.300\n Which was kind of the stage that they were at was like,\n\n1:36:41.300 --> 1:36:43.380\n you know, what's that experience gonna be like?\n\n1:36:43.380 --> 1:36:46.360\n And I was like, truckers aren't gonna like it, you know?\n\n1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:48.540\n I mean, that's just like the cardinal rule\n\n1:36:48.540 --> 1:36:49.760\n is following distance.\n\n1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:52.940\n Like that's the one you really shouldn't violate, right?\n\n1:36:52.940 --> 1:36:54.060\n And when you're out on the road,\n\n1:36:54.060 --> 1:36:56.220\n like you have that trucker like right on your ass,\n\n1:36:56.220 --> 1:36:58.200\n you know, people remember that.\n\n1:36:58.200 --> 1:37:01.280\n They don't remember the 99.9% of truckers\n\n1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:03.200\n that are not on their ass, you know?\n\n1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:05.360\n Like they're very careful about that.\n\n1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:07.560\n But when the trucks are really close together,\n\n1:37:07.560 --> 1:37:10.120\n there's benefits in terms of aerodynamics.\n\n1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:11.600\n So that's the idea.\n\n1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:16.520\n So like if you want to get some benefits of a platoon,\n\n1:37:16.520 --> 1:37:17.800\n you want them to be close together,\n\n1:37:17.800 --> 1:37:20.240\n but you're saying that's very uncomfortable for truckers.\n\n1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:22.200\n Yeah, so I mean, I think that ended up at the,\n\n1:37:22.200 --> 1:37:25.260\n I mean, Peloton I think is sort of winding down\n\n1:37:25.260 --> 1:37:27.400\n their work on this.\n\n1:37:27.400 --> 1:37:31.000\n And I think that ended up being still an open question.\n\n1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:33.440\n Like, and I had a chance to interview a couple drivers\n\n1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:36.040\n who at least one, maybe two of which\n\n1:37:36.040 --> 1:37:37.840\n had actually driven in their platoons.\n\n1:37:38.740 --> 1:37:41.280\n And I got completely different experiences.\n\n1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:43.360\n Some of them were like, it's really cool.\n\n1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:46.460\n You know, I'm like in communication with that other driver.\n\n1:37:46.460 --> 1:37:49.680\n You know, I can see on a screen what's out,\n\n1:37:49.680 --> 1:37:51.400\n you know, the front of his truck.\n\n1:37:51.400 --> 1:37:53.920\n And then some were like, it's too close.\n\n1:37:53.920 --> 1:37:55.280\n And it might be one of those things that's just,\n\n1:37:55.280 --> 1:37:57.960\n you know, it takes an adjustment to sort of get there.\n\n1:37:57.960 --> 1:37:59.440\n So you get the aerodynamic advantage,\n\n1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:01.940\n which, you know, saves fuel.\n\n1:38:01.940 --> 1:38:03.360\n There's some problems though, right?\n\n1:38:03.360 --> 1:38:07.000\n So, you know, you're getting that aerodynamic advantage\n\n1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:08.360\n because there's a low pressure system\n\n1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:10.400\n in front of that following truck.\n\n1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:14.480\n But the engine is designed with higher pressure\n\n1:38:14.480 --> 1:38:15.960\n feeding that engine, right?\n\n1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:18.120\n So there are sort of adjustments that you need to make\n\n1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:21.880\n and, you know, still the benefits are there.\n\n1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:22.960\n That's one scenario.\n\n1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:24.120\n And that's just the automation\n\n1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:26.920\n of that acceleration and braking.\n\n1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:29.620\n Starsky, which, you know,\n\n1:38:29.620 --> 1:38:32.340\n probably a lot of your listeners heard about,\n\n1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:34.820\n was working on another scenario,\n\n1:38:34.820 --> 1:38:38.200\n which was, you know, to solve that local problem\n\n1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:40.480\n was gonna do teleoperation, right?\n\n1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:41.900\n Sort of remote piloting.\n\n1:38:42.840 --> 1:38:44.280\n I had the chance to, you know,\n\n1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:46.320\n sort of watch them do that.\n\n1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:49.640\n You know, they drove a truck in Florida\n\n1:38:49.640 --> 1:38:53.640\n from San Francisco in one of their offices.\n\n1:38:53.640 --> 1:38:54.840\n That was really interesting.\n\n1:38:54.840 --> 1:38:55.680\n And then...\n\n1:38:55.680 --> 1:38:56.500\n In case it's not clear,\n\n1:38:56.500 --> 1:38:59.480\n teleoperation means you're controlling the truck remotely,\n\n1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:00.780\n like it's a video game.\n\n1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:05.020\n So you've gotten the chance to witness it.\n\n1:39:05.020 --> 1:39:06.840\n Does it actually work?\n\n1:39:06.840 --> 1:39:08.840\n Yeah, I mean, so it's a...\n\n1:39:08.840 --> 1:39:10.200\n What are the pros and cons?\n\n1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:12.680\n You know, one of the problems with doing research like this\n\n1:39:12.680 --> 1:39:16.560\n with all these Silicon Valley folks is the NDAs.\n\n1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:17.760\n Oh, right.\n\n1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:20.560\n So, you know, I don't know what I'm able to say\n\n1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:21.960\n about sort of watching it,\n\n1:39:21.960 --> 1:39:24.160\n but obviously they're public statements\n\n1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:25.520\n about sort of what the challenges are, right?\n\n1:39:25.520 --> 1:39:27.680\n And it's about the latency\n\n1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:31.200\n and the ability to sort of in real time.\n\n1:39:31.200 --> 1:39:32.140\n There's challenges there.\n\n1:39:32.140 --> 1:39:33.640\n Let me say one thing.\n\n1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:36.200\n So I'm talking to the...\n\n1:39:36.200 --> 1:39:38.440\n You know, I've talked to the Waymo CTO.\n\n1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:39.720\n I'm in conversations with them.\n\n1:39:39.720 --> 1:39:43.920\n I'm talking to the head of trucking, Boris Softman,\n\n1:39:43.920 --> 1:39:45.540\n in next month, actually.\n\n1:39:45.540 --> 1:39:48.120\n I'm a huge fan of his because he was,\n\n1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:49.320\n I think the founder of Anki,\n\n1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:52.300\n which is a toy robotics company.\n\n1:39:52.300 --> 1:39:55.640\n So I love human robot interaction.\n\n1:39:55.640 --> 1:39:58.840\n And he created one of the most effective\n\n1:39:58.840 --> 1:40:02.120\n and beautiful toy robots.\n\n1:40:03.080 --> 1:40:07.320\n Anyway, I keep complaining to them on email privately\n\n1:40:07.320 --> 1:40:11.960\n that there's way too much marketing in these conversations\n\n1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:14.960\n and not enough showing off both the challenge\n\n1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:16.840\n and the beauty of the engineering efforts.\n\n1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:18.160\n And that seems to be the case\n\n1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:21.300\n for a lot of these Silicon Valley tech companies.\n\n1:40:21.300 --> 1:40:24.200\n They put up this, you're talking about NDAs.\n\n1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:29.640\n For some reason, rightfully or wrongfully,\n\n1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:31.040\n because there's been so much hype\n\n1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:33.120\n and so much money being made,\n\n1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:38.120\n they don't see the upside in being transparent\n\n1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:43.300\n and educating the public about how difficult the problem is.\n\n1:40:43.300 --> 1:40:45.520\n It's much more effective for them to say,\n\n1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:46.720\n we have everything solved.\n\n1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:47.840\n This will change everything.\n\n1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:49.440\n This will change society as we know it.\n\n1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:51.120\n And just kind of wave their hands\n\n1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:53.040\n as opposed to exploring together\n\n1:40:53.040 --> 1:40:54.340\n like these different scenarios.\n\n1:40:54.340 --> 1:40:55.880\n What are the pros and cons?\n\n1:40:55.880 --> 1:40:57.700\n Why is it really difficult?\n\n1:40:57.700 --> 1:41:00.000\n You know, what are the gray areas\n\n1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:01.760\n of where it works and doesn't?\n\n1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:03.880\n What's the role of the human in this picture\n\n1:41:03.880 --> 1:41:06.480\n of the both sort of the operators\n\n1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:08.000\n and the other humans on the road?\n\n1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:11.520\n All of that, which are fascinating human problems,\n\n1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:12.960\n fascinating engineering problems\n\n1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:15.320\n that I wish we could have a conversation about\n\n1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:19.160\n as opposed to always feeling like it's just marketing talk.\n\n1:41:19.160 --> 1:41:22.480\n Because a lot of what we're talking about now,\n\n1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:26.700\n even you with having private conversations under NDA,\n\n1:41:26.700 --> 1:41:29.520\n you still don't have the full picture of everything,\n\n1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:31.240\n of how difficult this problem is.\n\n1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:34.400\n One of the big questions I've had,\n\n1:41:34.400 --> 1:41:37.000\n still have is how difficult is driving?\n\n1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:41.020\n I disagree with Elon Musk and Jim Keller on this point.\n\n1:41:41.020 --> 1:41:44.440\n I have a sense that driving is really difficult.\n\n1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:47.680\n You know, the task of driving, just broadly.\n\n1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:49.400\n This is like philosophy talk.\n\n1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:54.300\n How much intelligence is required to drive a car?\n\n1:41:55.360 --> 1:41:58.000\n So from like a Jim Keller,\n\n1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.340\n who used to be the head of autopilot,\n\n1:42:00.340 --> 1:42:03.080\n the idea is that it's just a collision avoidance problem.\n\n1:42:03.080 --> 1:42:04.320\n It's like billiard balls.\n\n1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:06.960\n It's like you have to convert the drive.\n\n1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:08.600\n You have to do some basic perception,\n\n1:42:08.600 --> 1:42:13.080\n a computer vision to convert driving into a game of pool.\n\n1:42:13.080 --> 1:42:15.880\n And then you just have to get everything into a pocket.\n\n1:42:15.880 --> 1:42:19.160\n To me, there just seems to be some game theoretic dance\n\n1:42:19.160 --> 1:42:21.820\n combined with the fact that people's life is at stake.\n\n1:42:21.820 --> 1:42:24.480\n And then when people die at the hands of a robot,\n\n1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:26.500\n the reaction is going to be much more complicated.\n\n1:42:26.500 --> 1:42:28.880\n So all of that, but that's still an open question.\n\n1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:31.920\n And the cool thing is all of these companies\n\n1:42:31.920 --> 1:42:34.160\n are struggling with this question\n\n1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:38.000\n of how difficult is it to solve this problem sufficiently\n\n1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:39.880\n such that we can build a business on top of it\n\n1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:41.720\n and have a product that's going to make\n\n1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:42.880\n a huge amount of money\n\n1:42:42.880 --> 1:42:46.680\n and compete with the manually driven vehicles.\n\n1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:49.680\n And so their teleoperation from Starsky's\n\n1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:50.800\n is really interesting idea.\n\n1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:53.560\n How much can, I mean,\n\n1:42:53.560 --> 1:42:55.320\n there's a few autonomous vehicle companies\n\n1:42:55.320 --> 1:42:59.000\n that tried to integrate teleoperation in the picture.\n\n1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:02.220\n Can we reduce some of the costs\n\n1:43:02.220 --> 1:43:04.640\n while still having reliability,\n\n1:43:04.640 --> 1:43:09.640\n like catch when the vehicle fails\n\n1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:11.680\n by having teleoperation?\n\n1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:12.840\n It's an open question.\n\n1:43:13.800 --> 1:43:17.020\n So that's for you scenario number two\n\n1:43:17.020 --> 1:43:20.080\n is to use teleoperation as part of the picture.\n\n1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:22.240\n Yeah, let me follow up on that question\n\n1:43:22.240 --> 1:43:23.380\n of how hard driving is,\n\n1:43:23.380 --> 1:43:26.560\n because this becomes a big question for researchers\n\n1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:28.520\n who are thinking about labor market impacts,\n\n1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:31.520\n because we start from a perspective\n\n1:43:31.520 --> 1:43:33.800\n of what's hard or easy for humans.\n\n1:43:34.840 --> 1:43:39.840\n And so if you were to look at truck driving prior to a lot,\n\n1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:41.920\n I mean, there's been a lot of thinking and debate\n\n1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:45.040\n in academic research circles\n\n1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:47.760\n around sort of how you estimate labor impacts,\n\n1:43:47.760 --> 1:43:49.000\n what these models look like.\n\n1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:52.120\n And a lot of it is about how automatable is a job,\n\n1:43:52.120 --> 1:43:54.960\n object recognition, really easy for people, right?\n\n1:43:54.960 --> 1:43:56.400\n Really hard for computers.\n\n1:43:56.400 --> 1:43:58.440\n And so there's a whole bunch of things\n\n1:43:58.440 --> 1:44:03.440\n that truck drivers do that we see as super easy\n\n1:44:03.840 --> 1:44:07.040\n and as it would have been characterized 10 years ago,\n\n1:44:07.040 --> 1:44:10.520\n routine, and it's not for a computer, right?\n\n1:44:10.520 --> 1:44:13.560\n It turns out to be something that we do naturally\n\n1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:16.480\n that is sort of cutting edge, right?\n\n1:44:16.480 --> 1:44:17.920\n Computer science.\n\n1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:20.160\n So on the teleoperation question,\n\n1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:23.960\n I think this is a more interesting one\n\n1:44:23.960 --> 1:44:28.060\n than people would like to sort of let on, I think, publicly.\n\n1:44:29.860 --> 1:44:32.160\n There are gonna be problems, right?\n\n1:44:32.160 --> 1:44:33.680\n And this is one of the complexities\n\n1:44:33.680 --> 1:44:35.480\n of sort of putting these things out in the world.\n\n1:44:35.480 --> 1:44:37.880\n And if you see the real world of trucking,\n\n1:44:37.880 --> 1:44:40.900\n you realize, wow, it's rough.\n\n1:44:40.900 --> 1:44:42.480\n There are dirt lots, there's gravel,\n\n1:44:42.480 --> 1:44:44.720\n there's salt and ice and cold weather,\n\n1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:46.720\n and there's equipment that just gets left out\n\n1:44:46.720 --> 1:44:47.680\n in the middle of nowhere,\n\n1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:49.580\n and the brakes don't get maintained,\n\n1:44:49.580 --> 1:44:51.560\n and somebody was supposed to service something\n\n1:44:51.560 --> 1:44:53.200\n and they didn't, you know?\n\n1:44:53.200 --> 1:44:56.000\n And so you imagine, okay, we've got this vehicle\n\n1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:57.140\n that can drive itself,\n\n1:44:57.140 --> 1:44:59.040\n which is gonna require a whole lot of sensors\n\n1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:02.120\n to tell it that the doors are still closed\n\n1:45:02.120 --> 1:45:03.600\n and the trailer's still hooked up\n\n1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:05.760\n and each of the tires has adequate pressure,\n\n1:45:05.760 --> 1:45:09.100\n and any number of, probably hundreds of sensors\n\n1:45:09.100 --> 1:45:11.880\n that are gonna be sort of relaying information.\n\n1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:15.800\n And one of them, after 500,000 miles or whatever,\n\n1:45:15.800 --> 1:45:17.060\n it goes out.\n\n1:45:17.060 --> 1:45:20.280\n Now, do we have some fleet of technicians\n\n1:45:20.280 --> 1:45:22.460\n sort of continually cruising the highways\n\n1:45:22.460 --> 1:45:25.120\n and sort of servicing these things as they do what?\n\n1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:27.240\n Pull themselves off to the side of the road\n\n1:45:27.240 --> 1:45:30.120\n and say, I've got a sensor fault, I'm pulling over,\n\n1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:32.960\n or maybe there's some level of safety critical faults\n\n1:45:32.960 --> 1:45:36.280\n or whatever it might be.\n\n1:45:36.280 --> 1:45:40.640\n So that suggests that there might be a role\n\n1:45:40.640 --> 1:45:43.760\n for teleoperation even with self driving.\n\n1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:47.920\n And when I push people on it in the conversations,\n\n1:45:47.920 --> 1:45:50.240\n they all are like, yeah, we kind of have that\n\n1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:52.000\n on the bottom of the list,\n\n1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:54.440\n figure out how to rescue truck, you know?\n\n1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:56.760\n I guess on the to do list, right?\n\n1:45:56.760 --> 1:46:00.100\n After solving the self driving question is like,\n\n1:46:00.100 --> 1:46:02.600\n yeah, what do we do with the problems, right?\n\n1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:04.920\n I mean, no, we could imagine like, all right,\n\n1:46:04.920 --> 1:46:08.440\n we have some protocol that the truck is not,\n\n1:46:08.440 --> 1:46:11.540\n realizes the system says not safe for operation,\n\n1:46:11.540 --> 1:46:13.160\n pull to the side.\n\n1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:15.720\n Good, you have a crash, but now you got a truck stranded\n\n1:46:15.720 --> 1:46:17.020\n on the side of the road.\n\n1:46:17.020 --> 1:46:19.920\n You're gonna send out somebody to like calibrate things\n\n1:46:19.920 --> 1:46:21.240\n and check out what's going on,\n\n1:46:21.240 --> 1:46:23.200\n or that sounds like expensive labor,\n\n1:46:23.200 --> 1:46:26.280\n it sounds like downtime, it sounds like the kind of things\n\n1:46:26.280 --> 1:46:28.840\n that shippers don't like to happen to their freight,\n\n1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:30.920\n you know, in a just in time world.\n\n1:46:30.920 --> 1:46:33.660\n And so wouldn't it be great if you could just sort of,\n\n1:46:33.660 --> 1:46:36.960\n you know, loop your way into the controls of that truck\n\n1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:38.920\n and say, all right, we've got a sensor out,\n\n1:46:38.920 --> 1:46:40.600\n says that the tire is bad,\n\n1:46:40.600 --> 1:46:43.280\n but I can see visually from the camera, looks fine,\n\n1:46:43.280 --> 1:46:45.560\n I'm gonna drive it to our next depot,\n\n1:46:45.560 --> 1:46:48.560\n you know, maybe the next rider or Penske location, right?\n\n1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:50.480\n Sort of all these service locations around\n\n1:46:50.480 --> 1:46:52.680\n and have a technician take a look at it.\n\n1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:57.000\n So teleoperation often gets this, you know,\n\n1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:02.000\n so dismissive, you know, commentary from other folks\n\n1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:04.040\n working on other scenarios.\n\n1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:07.000\n But I think it's potentially more relevant\n\n1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:09.880\n than we hear publicly.\n\n1:47:09.880 --> 1:47:11.800\n But it's a hard problem.\n\n1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:16.800\n And, you know, for me, I've gotten a chance\n\n1:47:17.640 --> 1:47:19.680\n to interact with people that take on hard problems\n\n1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:21.520\n and solve them and they're rare.\n\n1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:24.480\n What Tesla has done with their data engine.\n\n1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:29.440\n So I thought autonomous driving cannot be solved\n\n1:47:29.440 --> 1:47:31.320\n without collecting a huge amount of data\n\n1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:32.280\n and organizing it well,\n\n1:47:32.280 --> 1:47:34.800\n not just collecting, but organizing it.\n\n1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:37.300\n And exactly what Tesla is doing now\n\n1:47:37.300 --> 1:47:38.640\n is what I thought it would be,\n\n1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:40.600\n like I couldn't see car companies doing that,\n\n1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:42.200\n including Tesla.\n\n1:47:42.200 --> 1:47:44.640\n And now that they're doing that, it's like, oh, okay.\n\n1:47:44.640 --> 1:47:48.160\n So it's possible to take on this huge effort seriously.\n\n1:47:48.160 --> 1:47:51.880\n To me, teleoperation is another huge effort like that.\n\n1:47:51.880 --> 1:47:56.880\n It's like taking seriously what happens when it fails.\n\n1:47:56.960 --> 1:48:00.840\n What's the, in the case of Waymo for the consumer,\n\n1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:04.320\n like ride sharing, what's the customer experience like?\n\n1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:06.000\n There's a bunch of videos online now\n\n1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:09.200\n where people are like the car fails and it pulls off\n\n1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:11.600\n to the side and you call like customer service\n\n1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:13.880\n and you're basically sitting there for a long time\n\n1:48:13.880 --> 1:48:15.000\n and there's confusion.\n\n1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:17.000\n And then there's a rescue that comes\n\n1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:17.840\n and they start to drive.\n\n1:48:17.840 --> 1:48:19.760\n I mean, just the whole experience is a mess\n\n1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:23.360\n that has a ripple effect to how you trust\n\n1:48:23.360 --> 1:48:25.400\n in the entirety of the experience.\n\n1:48:25.400 --> 1:48:27.560\n But like actually taking on the problem\n\n1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:32.080\n of that failure case and revolutionizing that experience,\n\n1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:34.400\n both for trucking and for ride sharing,\n\n1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:35.920\n that's an amazing opportunity there\n\n1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:40.080\n because that feels like it would change everything.\n\n1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:42.720\n If you can reliably know when the failures happen,\n\n1:48:42.720 --> 1:48:45.120\n which they will, you have a clear plan\n\n1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:47.800\n that doesn't significantly affect the efficiency\n\n1:48:47.800 --> 1:48:51.720\n of the whole process, that could be the game changer.\n\n1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:53.200\n And if teleoperation is part of that,\n\n1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:54.880\n it could be just like you're saying,\n\n1:48:54.880 --> 1:48:57.920\n it could be teleoperation or it could be like a fleet\n\n1:48:57.920 --> 1:49:01.400\n of rescuers that can come in, which is a similar idea.\n\n1:49:01.400 --> 1:49:04.360\n But teleoperation, obviously that allows you\n\n1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:07.360\n to just have a network of monitors\n\n1:49:07.360 --> 1:49:10.680\n of people monitoring this giant fleet of trucks\n\n1:49:10.680 --> 1:49:12.760\n and taking over when needed.\n\n1:49:12.760 --> 1:49:14.720\n And it's a beautiful vision of the future\n\n1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:18.160\n where there's millions of robots\n\n1:49:18.160 --> 1:49:20.920\n and only thousands of humans monitoring\n\n1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:22.720\n those millions of robots.\n\n1:49:22.720 --> 1:49:27.360\n That seems like a perfect dance\n\n1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:29.560\n of allowing humans to do what they do best\n\n1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:31.960\n and allowing robots to do what they do best.\n\n1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:34.760\n Yeah, yeah, so I mean, I think there are,\n\n1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:37.840\n and we just applied for an NSF we didn't get,\n\n1:49:37.840 --> 1:49:41.560\n anybody's watching, but with some folks from Wisconsin\n\n1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:43.640\n who do teleoperation, right?\n\n1:49:43.640 --> 1:49:46.000\n And some of this is used for like rovers\n\n1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:50.480\n and I mean, really high stakes, difficult problems.\n\n1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:52.120\n But one of the things we wanted to study\n\n1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:55.480\n were these mines, these Rio Tinto mines in Australia\n\n1:49:55.480 --> 1:49:59.520\n where they remotely pilot the trucks.\n\n1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:01.600\n And there's some autonomy, I guess,\n\n1:50:01.600 --> 1:50:05.160\n but it's overseen by a remote operator\n\n1:50:05.160 --> 1:50:09.360\n and it's near Perth and it's quite remote\n\n1:50:09.360 --> 1:50:13.400\n and they retrained the truck drivers\n\n1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:15.800\n to be the remote operators, right?\n\n1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:18.320\n There's autonomy in the port of Rotterdam\n\n1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:21.040\n and places like that where there are jobs there.\n\n1:50:21.040 --> 1:50:24.000\n And so I think, and maybe we'll get to this later,\n\n1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:25.400\n but there's a real policy question\n\n1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:28.760\n about sort of who's gonna lose and what we do about it\n\n1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:31.280\n and whether or not there are opportunities there\n\n1:50:31.280 --> 1:50:33.760\n that maybe we need to put our thumb on the scale\n\n1:50:33.760 --> 1:50:38.640\n a little bit to make sure that there's some give back\n\n1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:41.720\n to the community that's taking the hit.\n\n1:50:41.720 --> 1:50:45.120\n So for instance, if there were teleoperation centers,\n\n1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:46.800\n maybe they go in these communities\n\n1:50:46.800 --> 1:50:50.480\n that we disproportionately source truck drivers from today.\n\n1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:52.000\n Now, I mean, what does that mean?\n\n1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:53.560\n It may not be the cheapest place to do it\n\n1:50:53.560 --> 1:50:55.160\n if they don't have great connectivity\n\n1:50:55.160 --> 1:50:58.520\n and it may not be where the upper level managers wanna be\n\n1:50:58.520 --> 1:51:01.080\n and places like that, issues like that, right?\n\n1:51:01.080 --> 1:51:04.880\n So I do think it's an interesting question,\n\n1:51:04.880 --> 1:51:09.760\n both from sort of a practical scenario situation\n\n1:51:09.760 --> 1:51:13.960\n of how it's gonna work, but also from a policy perspective.\n\n1:51:13.960 --> 1:51:16.960\n So there's platoons, there's teleoperation,\n\n1:51:16.960 --> 1:51:20.040\n and this is taking care of some of the highway driving\n\n1:51:20.040 --> 1:51:21.160\n that we're talking about.\n\n1:51:21.160 --> 1:51:22.900\n Is there other ideas like,\n\n1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:26.880\n is there other ideas, scenarios\n\n1:51:26.880 --> 1:51:28.840\n that you have for autonomous trucks?\n\n1:51:28.840 --> 1:51:31.560\n Yeah, so I mean, the most obvious one actually\n\n1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:34.760\n is just facility to facility, right?\n\n1:51:34.760 --> 1:51:37.640\n The sort of, it can't go everywhere,\n\n1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:40.480\n but a lot of logistics facilities\n\n1:51:40.480 --> 1:51:42.120\n are very close to interstates\n\n1:51:42.120 --> 1:51:45.140\n and they're on big commercial roads\n\n1:51:45.140 --> 1:51:48.900\n without bikes and parked cars and all that stuff.\n\n1:51:48.900 --> 1:51:51.740\n And some of the jobs that I think are really first\n\n1:51:51.740 --> 1:51:54.520\n on the chopping block are these LTL,\n\n1:51:54.520 --> 1:51:57.180\n that less than truckload, what's called line haul, right?\n\n1:51:57.180 --> 1:51:59.880\n So these are the drivers who go from terminal to terminal\n\n1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:01.520\n with those full trailers.\n\n1:52:02.360 --> 1:52:05.000\n And those facilities are often located strategically\n\n1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:07.080\n to avoid congestion, right?\n\n1:52:07.080 --> 1:52:10.120\n And to be in big industrial facilities.\n\n1:52:10.120 --> 1:52:14.200\n So you could imagine that being the first place\n\n1:52:14.200 --> 1:52:17.640\n you see a Waymo self driving truck rollout\n\n1:52:17.640 --> 1:52:21.800\n might be sort of direct facility to facility\n\n1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:25.640\n for UPS or FedEx or less than truckload care.\n\n1:52:25.640 --> 1:52:27.320\n And the idea there is fully driverless,\n\n1:52:27.320 --> 1:52:30.120\n so potentially not even a driver in the truck,\n\n1:52:30.120 --> 1:52:33.360\n it's just going from facility to facility empty,\n\n1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:34.900\n zero occupancy.\n\n1:52:34.900 --> 1:52:38.020\n Yeah, and those, because that labor is expensive,\n\n1:52:38.020 --> 1:52:39.520\n they don't keep those drivers out overnight,\n\n1:52:39.520 --> 1:52:42.520\n those drivers do a run back and forth typically,\n\n1:52:42.520 --> 1:52:45.800\n or in a team go back and forth in one day.\n\n1:52:47.020 --> 1:52:49.840\n So from the people you've spoken with so far,\n\n1:52:49.840 --> 1:52:50.660\n what's your sense?\n\n1:52:50.660 --> 1:52:53.920\n How far are we away from, which scenario is closest\n\n1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:56.960\n and how far away are we from that scenario\n\n1:52:56.960 --> 1:53:01.960\n of autonomy being a big part of our trucking fleet?\n\n1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:05.680\n Most folks are focused on another scenario,\n\n1:53:05.680 --> 1:53:07.740\n which is the exit to exit, right?\n\n1:53:07.740 --> 1:53:10.920\n Which looks like that urban truck ports thing\n\n1:53:10.920 --> 1:53:12.820\n that I laid out earlier.\n\n1:53:12.820 --> 1:53:14.280\n So you have a human driven truck\n\n1:53:14.280 --> 1:53:16.940\n that comes out to a drop lot,\n\n1:53:16.940 --> 1:53:19.820\n it meets up with an autonomous truck,\n\n1:53:19.820 --> 1:53:23.880\n that truck then drives it on the interstate to another lot,\n\n1:53:23.880 --> 1:53:27.920\n and then a human driver picks it up.\n\n1:53:27.920 --> 1:53:31.160\n There are a couple variations maybe on that.\n\n1:53:32.420 --> 1:53:36.040\n So, or let me just run through the last two scenarios.\n\n1:53:36.040 --> 1:53:36.880\n Sure.\n\n1:53:37.740 --> 1:53:39.920\n The other thing you could do, right,\n\n1:53:39.920 --> 1:53:43.880\n is to say, all right, I've got a truck that can drive itself,\n\n1:53:43.880 --> 1:53:46.200\n and I refer to this one as autopilot,\n\n1:53:46.200 --> 1:53:49.900\n but you have a human drive it out to the interstate,\n\n1:53:49.900 --> 1:53:52.640\n but rather than have that transaction\n\n1:53:52.640 --> 1:53:55.920\n where the human driven truck detaches the trailer\n\n1:53:55.920 --> 1:53:58.760\n and it gets coupled up to a self driving truck,\n\n1:53:58.760 --> 1:54:01.840\n they just, that human driver just hops on the interstate\n\n1:54:01.840 --> 1:54:05.560\n with that truck and goes in back and goes off duty\n\n1:54:05.560 --> 1:54:07.200\n while the truck drives itself.\n\n1:54:07.200 --> 1:54:09.120\n And so you have a self driving truck\n\n1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:11.360\n that's not driverless, right?\n\n1:54:11.360 --> 1:54:12.360\n And just to clarify,\n\n1:54:12.360 --> 1:54:15.480\n because Tesla uses the term autopilot instead of airplanes,\n\n1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:17.720\n and so everybody uses the word autopilot,\n\n1:54:17.720 --> 1:54:20.620\n we're referring to essentially full autonomy,\n\n1:54:20.620 --> 1:54:22.100\n but because it's exit to exit,\n\n1:54:22.100 --> 1:54:24.640\n the truck driver is onboard the truck,\n\n1:54:24.640 --> 1:54:26.800\n but they're sleeping in the back or whatever.\n\n1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:30.720\n Yeah, and this gets to the really weedy policy questions,\n\n1:54:30.720 --> 1:54:31.560\n right?\n\n1:54:31.560 --> 1:54:34.160\n So basically for the Department of Transportation,\n\n1:54:34.160 --> 1:54:36.360\n for you to be off duty for safety reasons,\n\n1:54:36.360 --> 1:54:39.340\n you have to be completely relieved of all responsibility.\n\n1:54:39.340 --> 1:54:44.340\n So that truck has to not encounter a construction site\n\n1:54:44.340 --> 1:54:47.820\n or inclement weather or whatever it might be,\n\n1:54:47.820 --> 1:54:49.980\n and call to you and say, hey, you know,\n\n1:54:49.980 --> 1:54:51.140\n or I mean, obviously, right,\n\n1:54:51.140 --> 1:54:53.460\n we're imagining connected vehicles as well, right?\n\n1:54:53.460 --> 1:54:55.700\n So you're in a self driving truck,\n\n1:54:55.700 --> 1:54:58.980\n you're in the back and trucks 20 miles ahead\n\n1:54:58.980 --> 1:55:01.740\n experience some problem, right?\n\n1:55:01.740 --> 1:55:04.380\n That may require teleoperation or whatever it is, right?\n\n1:55:04.380 --> 1:55:05.680\n And it signals to your truck,\n\n1:55:05.680 --> 1:55:08.620\n hey, you know, tell the driver 20 miles ahead,\n\n1:55:08.620 --> 1:55:10.660\n he's got to hop in the seat.\n\n1:55:10.660 --> 1:55:12.140\n That would mean that they're on duty\n\n1:55:12.140 --> 1:55:14.220\n according to the way that the current rules are written,\n\n1:55:14.220 --> 1:55:15.700\n they have some responsibility.\n\n1:55:15.700 --> 1:55:17.140\n And part of that is, you know,\n\n1:55:17.140 --> 1:55:19.300\n we need them to get rest, right?\n\n1:55:19.300 --> 1:55:22.540\n They need to have uninterrupted sleep.\n\n1:55:22.540 --> 1:55:25.420\n So that's what I call autopilot.\n\n1:55:25.420 --> 1:55:30.420\n The final scenario is one that I thought was actually\n\n1:55:30.540 --> 1:55:34.500\n the one scenario that was good for labor, you know,\n\n1:55:34.500 --> 1:55:38.260\n which I proposed is I was like, well, here's an idea,\n\n1:55:38.260 --> 1:55:41.460\n you know, that would be like, actually good for workers.\n\n1:55:41.460 --> 1:55:45.620\n And just another brief aside here.\n\n1:55:46.940 --> 1:55:51.300\n The history of trucking over the last, you know, 40 years,\n\n1:55:51.300 --> 1:55:53.100\n there's been a lot of technological change.\n\n1:55:53.100 --> 1:55:55.700\n So when I learned to drive the truck,\n\n1:55:55.700 --> 1:55:57.900\n I had to learn to manually shift it like I was describing,\n\n1:55:57.900 --> 1:56:00.620\n you had to read these fairly complicated, you know,\n\n1:56:00.620 --> 1:56:02.940\n big sets of laminated maps to figure out\n\n1:56:02.940 --> 1:56:04.820\n where the truck can go and where it couldn't,\n\n1:56:04.820 --> 1:56:06.180\n which is a big deal, you know,\n\n1:56:06.180 --> 1:56:07.820\n I mean, you take these trucks on the wrong road\n\n1:56:07.820 --> 1:56:09.380\n and you're destroying a bridge\n\n1:56:09.380 --> 1:56:10.460\n or you're doing a can opener,\n\n1:56:10.460 --> 1:56:12.820\n which is where you try to drive it under a bridge too low.\n\n1:56:12.820 --> 1:56:14.420\n You've probably seen that on YouTube,\n\n1:56:14.420 --> 1:56:17.540\n if not, you know, check it out, you know, truck can opener.\n\n1:56:18.660 --> 1:56:20.660\n You know, there's some bridges that are famous for it,\n\n1:56:20.660 --> 1:56:23.180\n right, and there's one I think called the can opener\n\n1:56:23.180 --> 1:56:24.740\n and you can find on YouTube.\n\n1:56:26.580 --> 1:56:30.180\n And, you know, you had to log those hours like manually\n\n1:56:30.180 --> 1:56:34.260\n and sort of do the math and plan your work routine.\n\n1:56:34.260 --> 1:56:35.300\n And I would do this every day.\n\n1:56:35.300 --> 1:56:37.340\n I'd say like, okay, I'm gonna get up at five.\n\n1:56:37.340 --> 1:56:40.020\n I've got to think about Buffalo and there's traffic there.\n\n1:56:40.020 --> 1:56:43.420\n So I wanna be through Buffalo by 6.30, you know,\n\n1:56:43.420 --> 1:56:47.300\n and then that'll put me, you know, in Cleveland at,\n\n1:56:47.300 --> 1:56:51.820\n you know, 9.30, which means I'll miss that rush hour, right,\n\n1:56:51.820 --> 1:56:53.580\n which is gonna put me in Chicago, you know,\n\n1:56:53.580 --> 1:56:57.420\n and so you do this and now today, you know,\n\n1:56:57.420 --> 1:57:00.620\n 15 years later, truck drivers don't have to do any of that.\n\n1:57:01.620 --> 1:57:03.780\n You know, you don't have to shift the truck,\n\n1:57:03.780 --> 1:57:05.940\n you don't have to map, you know,\n\n1:57:05.940 --> 1:57:09.460\n you can figure out the least congested route\n\n1:57:09.460 --> 1:57:12.660\n to go on and your hours of service are recorded\n\n1:57:12.660 --> 1:57:17.060\n or a good portion of them are reported automatically.\n\n1:57:17.060 --> 1:57:19.860\n All of that has been a substantial de skilling\n\n1:57:19.860 --> 1:57:23.300\n that has, you know, put downward pressure on wages\n\n1:57:23.300 --> 1:57:26.220\n and allowed companies to kind of speed up, monitor\n\n1:57:26.220 --> 1:57:29.820\n and direct, I mean, the key technology, you know,\n\n1:57:29.820 --> 1:57:32.500\n that I did work under is satellite linked computers.\n\n1:57:32.500 --> 1:57:34.820\n So before you could kind of go out and plan your own work\n\n1:57:34.820 --> 1:57:36.860\n and the boss really couldn't see what you were doing\n\n1:57:36.860 --> 1:57:39.460\n and push you and say, you know, you've been on break\n\n1:57:39.460 --> 1:57:41.260\n for 10 hours, why aren't you moving?\n\n1:57:41.260 --> 1:57:43.860\n You know, and you might tell them, you know,\n\n1:57:43.860 --> 1:57:45.940\n cause I'm tired, you know, like I didn't sleep well,\n\n1:57:45.940 --> 1:57:48.380\n I've got to get a couple more hours, you know,\n\n1:57:48.380 --> 1:57:50.380\n they're only gonna accept that so many times\n\n1:57:50.380 --> 1:57:51.980\n or at least some of those dispatchers are.\n\n1:57:51.980 --> 1:57:56.060\n So all this technology has made the job sort of, you know,\n\n1:57:56.060 --> 1:57:58.740\n de skilled the job, you know, hurt drivers\n\n1:57:58.740 --> 1:58:01.740\n in the labor market, made the work worse.\n\n1:58:01.740 --> 1:58:06.740\n So I think the burden it's really on the technologists\n\n1:58:07.100 --> 1:58:09.940\n who are like, oh, this will make truck driver jobs better\n\n1:58:09.940 --> 1:58:11.500\n and sort of envision ways that it would.\n\n1:58:11.500 --> 1:58:14.780\n It's like, the burden's really, a proof is really on you\n\n1:58:14.780 --> 1:58:17.540\n to sort of really clearly lay out what that\n\n1:58:17.540 --> 1:58:21.820\n is gonna look like because it's 30 or 40 years of history\n\n1:58:21.820 --> 1:58:25.180\n suggests that that technology into labor markets\n\n1:58:25.180 --> 1:58:29.580\n where workers are really weak and cheap is what wins\n\n1:58:29.580 --> 1:58:31.700\n that new technology doesn't help workers\n\n1:58:31.700 --> 1:58:33.060\n or raise their wages.\n\n1:58:33.940 --> 1:58:36.620\n So it lowers the bar of entry in terms of skill.\n\n1:58:36.620 --> 1:58:38.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:58:38.140 --> 1:58:41.140\n So that's really, that's tough.\n\n1:58:43.860 --> 1:58:46.420\n That's tough to know what to do with because yeah,\n\n1:58:46.420 --> 1:58:48.980\n from a technology perspective, you wanna make the life\n\n1:58:48.980 --> 1:58:51.700\n of the people doing the job today easier.\n\n1:58:51.700 --> 1:58:52.740\n Is it?\n\n1:58:52.740 --> 1:58:54.020\n Is that what you want?\n\n1:58:54.020 --> 1:58:58.660\n No, but that like, when you think about like what exactly,\n\n1:58:58.660 --> 1:59:01.940\n because the reality is you will make their life\n\n1:59:01.940 --> 1:59:04.100\n potentially a little bit easier,\n\n1:59:04.100 --> 1:59:07.340\n but that will allow the companies to then hire people\n\n1:59:07.340 --> 1:59:10.060\n that are less skilled, get those people\n\n1:59:10.060 --> 1:59:13.740\n that were previously working there fired or lower wages.\n\n1:59:13.740 --> 1:59:18.740\n And so the result of this easier is a lower quality of life.\n\n1:59:19.620 --> 1:59:20.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:59:20.460 --> 1:59:21.460\n That's dark actually.\n\n1:59:21.460 --> 1:59:23.260\n I know, I'm sorry.\n\n1:59:23.260 --> 1:59:27.140\n But you were saying that was for you initially the hopeful.\n\n1:59:27.140 --> 1:59:28.860\n Oh no, so I'll get to that.\n\n1:59:28.860 --> 1:59:31.220\n But one more thing, cause this is not stopping.\n\n1:59:31.220 --> 1:59:32.900\n And this is another interesting question\n\n1:59:32.900 --> 1:59:34.020\n about the sort of automation.\n\n1:59:34.020 --> 1:59:38.460\n And I think Uber is an interesting example here\n\n1:59:38.460 --> 1:59:40.900\n where it's like, okay, if we had self driving trucks\n\n1:59:40.900 --> 1:59:43.780\n or self driving cars, we could automate\n\n1:59:43.780 --> 1:59:46.060\n what used to be taxi service.\n\n1:59:46.060 --> 1:59:46.980\n There's a whole bunch of stuff\n\n1:59:46.980 --> 1:59:49.540\n that's already been automated, like the dispatching.\n\n1:59:49.540 --> 1:59:52.980\n So the dispatchers are already out of work in rideshare\n\n1:59:52.980 --> 1:59:55.180\n and the payment is already automated.\n\n1:59:55.180 --> 1:59:57.460\n So you have to automate steps like this.\n\n1:59:57.460 --> 2:00:00.820\n So you have to have that initial link to dispatch the truck.\n\n2:00:00.820 --> 2:00:04.140\n You have to have the automated mapping.\n\n2:00:04.140 --> 2:00:07.780\n So we're sort of done all this incremental automation\n\n2:00:07.780 --> 2:00:11.460\n that could make the truck completely driverless.\n\n2:00:11.460 --> 2:00:13.980\n There's some important things happening right now\n\n2:00:13.980 --> 2:00:15.260\n with the remaining good jobs.\n\n2:00:15.260 --> 2:00:17.340\n So what you're really paying for\n\n2:00:17.340 --> 2:00:20.340\n when you get a good truck driver is, like I said,\n\n2:00:20.340 --> 2:00:22.580\n you get those kind of local skills\n\n2:00:22.580 --> 2:00:26.300\n of like backing and congested traffic.\n\n2:00:26.300 --> 2:00:28.660\n Those, it's really impressive to watch\n\n2:00:28.660 --> 2:00:30.340\n and there's some value on it certainly,\n\n2:00:30.340 --> 2:00:33.580\n but it's relatively low value\n\n2:00:33.580 --> 2:00:35.940\n in the actual driving technique, right?\n\n2:00:35.940 --> 2:00:39.100\n So you bump something backing into the dock,\n\n2:00:39.100 --> 2:00:41.300\n it might be a couple of thousand dollars\n\n2:00:41.300 --> 2:00:43.500\n because you ruin a canopy or something over a dock\n\n2:00:43.500 --> 2:00:44.500\n or tear up a trailer.\n\n2:00:45.380 --> 2:00:46.460\n What you really want,\n\n2:00:46.460 --> 2:00:50.500\n those highly skilled conscientious drivers,\n\n2:00:50.500 --> 2:00:52.060\n and that's really what it is.\n\n2:00:52.060 --> 2:00:53.900\n And that's what computers are really good at\n\n2:00:53.900 --> 2:00:55.780\n is about being conscientious, right?\n\n2:00:55.780 --> 2:00:59.140\n In the sense of like, they pay attention continually, right?\n\n2:00:59.140 --> 2:01:02.220\n And how I was describing those long haul segments\n\n2:01:02.220 --> 2:01:06.540\n where the driver just keeps out of the situations\n\n2:01:06.540 --> 2:01:08.820\n that could become problematic\n\n2:01:08.820 --> 2:01:10.780\n and just, they don't look at their phone.\n\n2:01:10.780 --> 2:01:13.300\n I mean, they take the job seriously and they're safe\n\n2:01:13.300 --> 2:01:16.820\n and you can give somebody a skills test, right?\n\n2:01:16.820 --> 2:01:19.100\n As a CDL examiner, you could take them out and say,\n\n2:01:19.100 --> 2:01:20.580\n all right, I need you to go around these cones\n\n2:01:20.580 --> 2:01:24.180\n and drive safely through this school zone.\n\n2:01:24.180 --> 2:01:27.020\n But what really proves that you're a safe driver\n\n2:01:27.020 --> 2:01:29.580\n is two years without an accident, right?\n\n2:01:29.580 --> 2:01:31.740\n Because that means that day after day,\n\n2:01:31.740 --> 2:01:34.180\n hour after hour, mile after mile,\n\n2:01:34.180 --> 2:01:36.580\n you did the right thing, right?\n\n2:01:36.580 --> 2:01:39.340\n And not when it was like, oh, some situations emerging,\n\n2:01:39.340 --> 2:01:41.340\n but just consistently over time\n\n2:01:41.340 --> 2:01:43.660\n kept yourself out of accident situations.\n\n2:01:43.660 --> 2:01:46.180\n And you can see this with drivers who are a million\n\n2:01:46.180 --> 2:01:47.980\n or 2 million safe miles.\n\n2:01:47.980 --> 2:01:50.300\n The value of those drivers for Walmart\n\n2:01:50.300 --> 2:01:52.780\n is they don't run over minivans.\n\n2:01:52.780 --> 2:01:54.780\n The company I worked for,\n\n2:01:54.780 --> 2:01:57.180\n they ran over minivans on a regular basis.\n\n2:01:57.180 --> 2:02:00.540\n So when I was trained, they said, we kill 20 people a year.\n\n2:02:03.100 --> 2:02:04.780\n We send someone to the funeral,\n\n2:02:04.780 --> 2:02:08.700\n there's a big check involved, don't be that.\n\n2:02:08.700 --> 2:02:10.460\n We don't wanna go to your funeral\n\n2:02:10.460 --> 2:02:15.220\n and you don't wanna be the person who caused that funeral.\n\n2:02:15.220 --> 2:02:18.340\n Okay, so they just write that off.\n\n2:02:18.340 --> 2:02:20.780\n Okay, that's just part of the business model.\n\n2:02:20.780 --> 2:02:23.700\n Now, forward collision avoidance\n\n2:02:25.340 --> 2:02:29.500\n can basically eliminate the vast majority\n\n2:02:29.500 --> 2:02:30.980\n of those accidents.\n\n2:02:30.980 --> 2:02:33.260\n That's what the value of a really expensive\n\n2:02:33.260 --> 2:02:35.020\n conscientious driver is based on.\n\n2:02:35.020 --> 2:02:37.060\n They don't run over minivans.\n\n2:02:37.060 --> 2:02:40.340\n So as soon as you have that forward collision avoidance,\n\n2:02:40.340 --> 2:02:43.460\n what's gonna happen to the wages of those drivers?\n\n2:02:43.460 --> 2:02:48.460\n By way of a therapy session, help me understand,\n\n2:02:48.500 --> 2:02:51.060\n is a collision avoidance,\n\n2:02:52.660 --> 2:02:55.300\n automated collision avoidance systems,\n\n2:02:55.300 --> 2:02:57.820\n are they good or bad for society?\n\n2:02:57.820 --> 2:03:02.220\n Yeah, I mean, this is, they're good.\n\n2:03:02.220 --> 2:03:03.540\n Right. They're good.\n\n2:03:03.540 --> 2:03:08.540\n But what do we do about the pain of a workforce\n\n2:03:08.540 --> 2:03:13.540\n in the short term because their wages are gonna go down\n\n2:03:13.740 --> 2:03:16.740\n because the job starts requiring less and less skill?\n\n2:03:18.140 --> 2:03:20.340\n Is there a hopeful message here\n\n2:03:20.340 --> 2:03:22.660\n where other jobs are created?\n\n2:03:22.660 --> 2:03:24.660\n So I'm a sociologist, right?\n\n2:03:24.660 --> 2:03:28.380\n So I'm gonna think about what's the structure behind that\n\n2:03:28.380 --> 2:03:30.140\n that creates that pain, right?\n\n2:03:30.140 --> 2:03:32.860\n And it's ownership, right?\n\n2:03:32.860 --> 2:03:35.660\n We don't call it capitalism for nothing.\n\n2:03:35.660 --> 2:03:39.100\n What capitalists do is they figure out cheaper,\n\n2:03:39.100 --> 2:03:40.700\n more efficient ways to do stuff.\n\n2:03:40.700 --> 2:03:43.260\n And they use technology to do that oftentimes, right?\n\n2:03:43.260 --> 2:03:47.620\n This is the remarkable history of the last couple centuries\n\n2:03:47.620 --> 2:03:50.620\n and all the productivity gains is,\n\n2:03:50.620 --> 2:03:54.460\n people who were in a competitive market saying,\n\n2:03:54.460 --> 2:03:56.500\n if I have to do it, right?\n\n2:03:56.500 --> 2:03:57.460\n I don't have a choice.\n\n2:03:57.460 --> 2:04:00.420\n Cause like my competitor over there is gonna eat my lunch\n\n2:04:00.420 --> 2:04:02.420\n if I'm not on my game.\n\n2:04:03.540 --> 2:04:04.500\n I don't have a choice.\n\n2:04:04.500 --> 2:04:06.780\n I've got to invest in this technology\n\n2:04:06.780 --> 2:04:10.860\n to make it more efficient, to make it cheaper.\n\n2:04:10.860 --> 2:04:12.300\n And what do you look for?\n\n2:04:12.300 --> 2:04:16.060\n You look for oftentimes, you look for labor costs, right?\n\n2:04:16.060 --> 2:04:17.460\n You look for high value labor.\n\n2:04:17.460 --> 2:04:19.740\n If I can take a hundred and,\n\n2:04:19.740 --> 2:04:21.060\n a lot of these truck drivers make good money,\n\n2:04:21.060 --> 2:04:22.660\n a hundred thousand dollars, good benefits,\n\n2:04:22.660 --> 2:04:25.340\n vacation, retirement.\n\n2:04:25.340 --> 2:04:28.460\n If I can replace them with a $35,000 worker\n\n2:04:28.460 --> 2:04:32.340\n when I'm competing with maybe a low wage retail employer\n\n2:04:32.340 --> 2:04:34.700\n rather than some other more expensive employers\n\n2:04:34.700 --> 2:04:39.020\n for skilled blue collar workers, I'm gonna do that.\n\n2:04:39.020 --> 2:04:41.700\n And that's just, that's what we do.\n\n2:04:41.700 --> 2:04:45.620\n And so I think those are the bigger questions\n\n2:04:45.620 --> 2:04:46.820\n around this technology, right?\n\n2:04:46.820 --> 2:04:50.140\n Is like, are workers gonna get screwed by this?\n\n2:04:50.140 --> 2:04:51.580\n Like, yeah, most likely.\n\n2:04:51.580 --> 2:04:54.060\n Like that's what we do.\n\n2:04:54.060 --> 2:04:55.180\n So one of the things you say is,\n\n2:04:55.180 --> 2:04:56.860\n I mean, first of all, the numbers of workers\n\n2:04:56.860 --> 2:05:00.020\n that will feel this pain is not perhaps as large\n\n2:05:00.020 --> 2:05:02.780\n as the journalists kind of articulate,\n\n2:05:02.780 --> 2:05:05.260\n but nevertheless, the pain is real.\n\n2:05:05.260 --> 2:05:10.260\n And I guess my question here is,\n\n2:05:11.500 --> 2:05:12.860\n do you have an optimistic vision\n\n2:05:12.860 --> 2:05:14.380\n about the transformative effects\n\n2:05:14.380 --> 2:05:16.500\n of autonomous trucks on society?\n\n2:05:17.420 --> 2:05:21.380\n Like if you look 20 years from now\n\n2:05:21.380 --> 2:05:24.500\n and perhaps see maybe 30 years from now,\n\n2:05:24.500 --> 2:05:26.580\n perhaps see these autonomous trucks\n\n2:05:26.580 --> 2:05:30.260\n doing the various parts of the scenarios you listed.\n\n2:05:30.260 --> 2:05:33.380\n And there's just hundreds of thousands of them,\n\n2:05:33.380 --> 2:05:38.380\n just like veins, like blood flowing through veins\n\n2:05:38.380 --> 2:05:40.420\n on the interstate system.\n\n2:05:43.580 --> 2:05:46.300\n What kind of world do you see that's a better world\n\n2:05:46.300 --> 2:05:48.460\n than today that involves such trucks?\n\n2:05:48.460 --> 2:05:51.020\n Yeah, can I defend myself first?\n\n2:05:51.020 --> 2:05:53.740\n Because I'm reading the comments right now\n\n2:05:53.740 --> 2:05:56.020\n of people, of the economists who are telling me.\n\n2:05:56.020 --> 2:05:59.500\n Another commenter, dear PhD in economics.\n\n2:05:59.500 --> 2:06:02.540\n Yes, yes, dear PhD in economics,\n\n2:06:02.540 --> 2:06:05.300\n I know that higher skilled jobs\n\n2:06:05.300 --> 2:06:09.060\n are created by technological advancement, right?\n\n2:06:09.060 --> 2:06:11.580\n I mean, there are big questions about how many of them,\n\n2:06:11.580 --> 2:06:14.060\n right, so the idea that we would create\n\n2:06:14.060 --> 2:06:19.060\n more expensive labor positions, right,\n\n2:06:19.500 --> 2:06:20.660\n with a new technology, right?\n\n2:06:20.660 --> 2:06:22.540\n You better check your business plan\n\n2:06:22.540 --> 2:06:26.300\n if your idea is to take a bunch of low wage labor\n\n2:06:26.300 --> 2:06:28.700\n and replace it with the same amount of high wage labor,\n\n2:06:28.700 --> 2:06:31.740\n right, so there's a question about how many of those jobs.\n\n2:06:31.740 --> 2:06:34.060\n And there's the really important social\n\n2:06:34.060 --> 2:06:38.140\n and political question of are they the same people, right?\n\n2:06:38.140 --> 2:06:39.700\n And do they live in the same places?\n\n2:06:39.700 --> 2:06:42.460\n And I think that kind of geography\n\n2:06:42.460 --> 2:06:45.380\n is a huge issue here with the impacts, right?\n\n2:06:45.380 --> 2:06:47.540\n Lots of rural workers.\n\n2:06:47.540 --> 2:06:50.020\n Interesting politically, lots of red state workers, right?\n\n2:06:50.020 --> 2:06:51.940\n Lots of blue state, maybe union folks\n\n2:06:51.940 --> 2:06:53.980\n who are gonna try to slow autonomy\n\n2:06:53.980 --> 2:06:57.260\n and lots of red state representatives in the house maybe\n\n2:06:57.260 --> 2:07:01.460\n who wanna stand up for their trucker constituents.\n\n2:07:01.460 --> 2:07:03.220\n So just to defend myself.\n\n2:07:03.220 --> 2:07:06.620\n Yeah, and to elaborate, I think economics as a field\n\n2:07:06.620 --> 2:07:08.300\n is not good at measuring the landscape\n\n2:07:08.300 --> 2:07:10.220\n of human pain and suffering.\n\n2:07:10.220 --> 2:07:13.780\n So sometimes you can forget in the numbers\n\n2:07:13.780 --> 2:07:15.380\n that it's real lives that are at stake.\n\n2:07:15.380 --> 2:07:18.460\n That's what I suppose sociology is better at doing.\n\n2:07:18.460 --> 2:07:20.660\n So we try sometimes, sometimes.\n\n2:07:20.660 --> 2:07:22.140\n Well, the problem with, I mean,\n\n2:07:22.140 --> 2:07:25.940\n I'm somebody who loves psychology and psychiatry\n\n2:07:25.940 --> 2:07:28.820\n and a little bit, I guess, of sociology.\n\n2:07:28.820 --> 2:07:33.260\n I realize how little, how tragically flawed the field is,\n\n2:07:33.260 --> 2:07:34.740\n not because of lack of trying,\n\n2:07:34.740 --> 2:07:37.420\n but just how difficult the problems are.\n\n2:07:37.420 --> 2:07:39.740\n To do really thorough studies\n\n2:07:39.740 --> 2:07:42.380\n that understand the fundamentals of human behavior\n\n2:07:42.380 --> 2:07:45.740\n and this, yes, landscape of human suffering,\n\n2:07:45.740 --> 2:07:48.700\n it's almost an impossible task without the data.\n\n2:07:48.700 --> 2:07:53.540\n And we currently don't, not everybody's richly integrated\n\n2:07:53.540 --> 2:07:54.900\n to where they're fully connected\n\n2:07:54.900 --> 2:07:58.700\n and all their information is being recorded\n\n2:07:58.700 --> 2:08:00.580\n for sociologists to study.\n\n2:08:00.580 --> 2:08:02.260\n So you have to make a lot of inferences.\n\n2:08:02.260 --> 2:08:03.460\n You have to talk to people.\n\n2:08:03.460 --> 2:08:05.140\n You have to do the interviews as you're doing.\n\n2:08:05.140 --> 2:08:07.860\n And through that really difficult work,\n\n2:08:07.860 --> 2:08:11.660\n try to understand, hear the music\n\n2:08:11.660 --> 2:08:13.420\n that nobody else is hearing,\n\n2:08:13.420 --> 2:08:15.820\n the music of what people are feeling,\n\n2:08:15.820 --> 2:08:19.780\n their hopes, their dreams, and the crushing of their dreams\n\n2:08:19.780 --> 2:08:22.300\n due to some kind of economic forces.\n\n2:08:22.300 --> 2:08:24.660\n Yeah, I mean, we've just lived that\n\n2:08:24.660 --> 2:08:28.620\n for four and a half years of probably elites,\n\n2:08:28.620 --> 2:08:30.820\n let me just go out on a limb and say,\n\n2:08:30.820 --> 2:08:33.740\n not understanding the sort of emotional\n\n2:08:33.740 --> 2:08:35.020\n and psychological currents\n\n2:08:35.020 --> 2:08:37.780\n of a large portion of the population, right?\n\n2:08:37.780 --> 2:08:41.180\n And just being stunned by it and confused, right?\n\n2:08:41.180 --> 2:08:46.180\n It wasn't confusing for me after having talked to truckers.\n\n2:08:46.180 --> 2:08:48.860\n Again, trucking is a job of last resort.\n\n2:08:48.860 --> 2:08:50.540\n These are people who've already lost\n\n2:08:50.540 --> 2:08:52.380\n that manufacturing job oftentimes,\n\n2:08:52.380 --> 2:08:57.380\n already lost that construction job to just aging, right?\n\n2:08:57.380 --> 2:08:59.500\n So what can we do, right?\n\n2:08:59.500 --> 2:09:01.100\n What's sort of the positive vision?\n\n2:09:01.100 --> 2:09:04.140\n Because like, we've got tons of highway deaths.\n\n2:09:04.140 --> 2:09:09.140\n We've got, and just the big picture is,\n\n2:09:09.140 --> 2:09:12.180\n and this is the opportunity, I guess, for investors,\n\n2:09:13.060 --> 2:09:15.660\n it's a hugely inefficient system.\n\n2:09:15.660 --> 2:09:17.340\n So we buy this truck,\n\n2:09:17.340 --> 2:09:19.660\n there's this low wage worker in it oftentimes.\n\n2:09:19.660 --> 2:09:21.900\n And again, I'm setting aside those really good\n\n2:09:21.900 --> 2:09:24.640\n line haul jobs in LTL, those are a different case.\n\n2:09:26.140 --> 2:09:30.540\n That low wage worker is driving a truck that they might,\n\n2:09:30.540 --> 2:09:32.460\n the wheels might roll seven to eight hours a day.\n\n2:09:32.460 --> 2:09:33.940\n That's what the truck is designed to do\n\n2:09:33.940 --> 2:09:36.300\n and that's what makes the money for the company.\n\n2:09:36.300 --> 2:09:37.980\n In other seven, eight hours a day,\n\n2:09:37.980 --> 2:09:39.860\n the driver's doing other kinds of work\n\n2:09:39.860 --> 2:09:41.940\n that is not driving.\n\n2:09:41.940 --> 2:09:42.820\n And then the rest of the day,\n\n2:09:42.820 --> 2:09:45.540\n they're basically living out of the truck.\n\n2:09:45.540 --> 2:09:49.020\n You really can't find a more inefficient use of an asset\n\n2:09:49.020 --> 2:09:51.140\n than that, right?\n\n2:09:51.140 --> 2:09:53.020\n Now, a big part of that is we pay for the roads\n\n2:09:53.020 --> 2:09:55.660\n and we pay for the rest areas and all this other stuff.\n\n2:09:55.660 --> 2:09:59.100\n So the way that I work and the way that I think\n\n2:09:59.100 --> 2:10:01.380\n about these problems is I try to find analogies, right?\n\n2:10:01.380 --> 2:10:04.620\n Sort of labor processes and things that make economic sense\n\n2:10:04.620 --> 2:10:09.620\n that seem in the same area of the economy,\n\n2:10:11.580 --> 2:10:15.420\n but have some different characteristics for workers, right?\n\n2:10:15.420 --> 2:10:17.020\n And sort of try to figure out\n\n2:10:17.020 --> 2:10:19.540\n why does the economics work there, right?\n\n2:10:19.540 --> 2:10:24.460\n And so if you look at those really good jobs,\n\n2:10:24.460 --> 2:10:29.100\n the most likely way that you as a passenger car driver\n\n2:10:29.100 --> 2:10:30.820\n would know that it's one of those drivers\n\n2:10:30.820 --> 2:10:33.060\n is that there are multiple trailers, right?\n\n2:10:33.060 --> 2:10:35.580\n So you see these, like maybe it's three small trailers,\n\n2:10:35.580 --> 2:10:37.860\n maybe it's two sort of medium sized trailers.\n\n2:10:37.860 --> 2:10:39.020\n Some places you might even see\n\n2:10:39.020 --> 2:10:40.700\n two really big trailers together.\n\n2:10:42.260 --> 2:10:44.500\n You do that because labor is expensive, right?\n\n2:10:44.500 --> 2:10:45.660\n And it's highly skilled.\n\n2:10:45.660 --> 2:10:48.740\n And so you use it efficiently and you say, all right,\n\n2:10:48.740 --> 2:10:51.340\n rather than having you haul that little trailer\n\n2:10:51.340 --> 2:10:54.020\n out of the ports, that sort of half size container,\n\n2:10:54.020 --> 2:10:55.100\n we're gonna wait till we get three\n\n2:10:55.100 --> 2:10:56.540\n or we're gonna coordinate the movement\n\n2:10:56.540 --> 2:10:57.780\n so that they're three ready.\n\n2:10:57.780 --> 2:11:00.580\n You go do what truckers call make a set,\n\n2:11:00.580 --> 2:11:03.140\n put them together, right, and you go.\n\n2:11:04.020 --> 2:11:06.060\n That's a massive productivity gain, right?\n\n2:11:06.060 --> 2:11:09.860\n Because you're hauling two, three times as much freight.\n\n2:11:09.860 --> 2:11:13.820\n So the positive scenario that I threw out in 2018\n\n2:11:13.820 --> 2:11:18.740\n was why not have a human driven truck\n\n2:11:18.740 --> 2:11:20.660\n with a self driving truck that follows it, right?\n\n2:11:20.660 --> 2:11:21.940\n Just a drone unit.\n\n2:11:23.180 --> 2:11:28.180\n And to me, this seemed as a non computer scientist,\n\n2:11:28.180 --> 2:11:31.180\n a non computer scientist, a sociologist, right?\n\n2:11:31.180 --> 2:11:33.620\n This made a lot of sense because when I got done talking\n\n2:11:33.620 --> 2:11:36.740\n to the computer scientists and the engineers,\n\n2:11:36.740 --> 2:11:38.940\n they were like, well, it's like object recognition,\n\n2:11:38.940 --> 2:11:40.740\n decision making algorithm, all this stuff.\n\n2:11:40.740 --> 2:11:43.460\n It's like, all right, so why don't you leave\n\n2:11:43.460 --> 2:11:46.820\n the human brain in the lead vehicle, right?\n\n2:11:46.820 --> 2:11:50.620\n You got all that processing and then all that following.\n\n2:11:50.620 --> 2:11:54.620\n Now, again, this is sort of me being a lay person.\n\n2:11:54.620 --> 2:11:57.140\n I said, why don't, then that following truck, right,\n\n2:11:57.140 --> 2:11:58.380\n makes direction from the front.\n\n2:11:58.380 --> 2:12:01.140\n It uses the rear of the trailer as a reference point.\n\n2:12:01.140 --> 2:12:02.220\n It maintains the lane.\n\n2:12:02.220 --> 2:12:04.740\n You've got cooperative adaptive cruise control\n\n2:12:04.740 --> 2:12:08.700\n and that you double the productivity of that driver.\n\n2:12:08.700 --> 2:12:11.620\n You solve that problem that I hated\n\n2:12:11.620 --> 2:12:15.700\n in my urban truck ports thing about the bridge weight.\n\n2:12:15.700 --> 2:12:17.500\n Cause when you get to the bridges,\n\n2:12:17.500 --> 2:12:20.380\n the two trucks can just spread out just enough\n\n2:12:20.380 --> 2:12:21.500\n to make the bridge weight, right?\n\n2:12:21.500 --> 2:12:22.740\n And you can just program that in\n\n2:12:22.740 --> 2:12:24.580\n and they're 50 feet further apart,\n\n2:12:24.580 --> 2:12:28.420\n 100 feet further apart.\n\n2:12:28.420 --> 2:12:32.500\n So interesting sort of, I think, story about this\n\n2:12:32.500 --> 2:12:35.220\n that leads to kind of, I think, the policy questions.\n\n2:12:36.700 --> 2:12:41.700\n In, I guess, 2017, Jack Reed and Susan Collins\n\n2:12:42.260 --> 2:12:44.580\n and requested from the Senate,\n\n2:12:44.580 --> 2:12:47.180\n the Senate requested research on what the impacts\n\n2:12:47.180 --> 2:12:48.820\n of self driving trucks would be.\n\n2:12:48.820 --> 2:12:51.780\n And the first stage of that was for the GAO\n\n2:12:51.780 --> 2:12:56.780\n to do a report, sort of looking at the lay of the land,\n\n2:12:56.940 --> 2:12:58.260\n talking to some experts.\n\n2:12:59.420 --> 2:13:03.180\n And I was working on my 2018 report,\n\n2:13:03.180 --> 2:13:06.260\n help contribute to that GAO report.\n\n2:13:06.260 --> 2:13:08.940\n And I had the six scenarios, right?\n\n2:13:08.940 --> 2:13:12.180\n I'm like, okay, here's what Starsky's doing.\n\n2:13:12.180 --> 2:13:16.060\n Here's what Embark and Uber are doing.\n\n2:13:16.060 --> 2:13:18.580\n Here's what Waymo might be doing.\n\n2:13:18.580 --> 2:13:20.700\n Nobody really knows, right?\n\n2:13:20.700 --> 2:13:22.300\n Here's what Peloton's doing.\n\n2:13:23.340 --> 2:13:25.300\n Here's the autopilot scenario.\n\n2:13:25.300 --> 2:13:27.180\n And then here's this one that I think\n\n2:13:27.180 --> 2:13:29.500\n actually could be good for drivers.\n\n2:13:29.500 --> 2:13:31.900\n So now you've got that driver who's got\n\n2:13:31.900 --> 2:13:34.460\n two times the freight.\n\n2:13:34.460 --> 2:13:35.700\n Their decisions are more important.\n\n2:13:35.700 --> 2:13:37.660\n They're managing a more complex system, right?\n\n2:13:37.660 --> 2:13:38.620\n They're probably gonna have to have\n\n2:13:38.620 --> 2:13:40.620\n some global understanding of how to,\n\n2:13:40.620 --> 2:13:42.540\n the environments in which it can operate safely, right?\n\n2:13:42.540 --> 2:13:44.580\n Now we're talking upskilling, right?\n\n2:13:44.580 --> 2:13:49.580\n And so the GAO sort of writes up these different scenarios\n\n2:13:52.260 --> 2:13:54.340\n and the idea is that it's gonna prepare\n\n2:13:54.340 --> 2:13:56.020\n for this Department of Transportation,\n\n2:13:56.020 --> 2:13:58.780\n Department of Labor set of processes\n\n2:13:58.780 --> 2:14:03.780\n to engage stakeholders and sort of get industry perspectives\n\n2:14:05.300 --> 2:14:07.700\n and then do a study on the labor impacts.\n\n2:14:07.700 --> 2:14:12.700\n So that DOT, DOL process starts to happen\n\n2:14:12.700 --> 2:14:17.700\n and I get to the workshop and a friend was sitting\n\n2:14:18.180 --> 2:14:22.460\n at the table next to me and he holds up the scenarios\n\n2:14:22.460 --> 2:14:24.980\n that they're gonna have us discuss at this workshop.\n\n2:14:24.980 --> 2:14:27.900\n And he's like, hey, these look really familiar, right?\n\n2:14:27.900 --> 2:14:30.740\n They were the scenarios from the report,\n\n2:14:30.740 --> 2:14:33.740\n but there were only five instead of six.\n\n2:14:33.740 --> 2:14:34.860\n Interesting.\n\n2:14:34.860 --> 2:14:37.900\n The sixth scenario, which was the upskilling labor,\n\n2:14:37.900 --> 2:14:42.180\n good for workers scenario, wasn't discussed.\n\n2:14:42.180 --> 2:14:45.700\n So to clarify that the integral piece of technology\n\n2:14:45.700 --> 2:14:47.420\n there is platooning.\n\n2:14:47.420 --> 2:14:50.020\n Yeah, I mean, in a sense it's platooning,\n\n2:14:50.020 --> 2:14:54.940\n but, and in fairness, right, as I pitched that idea\n\n2:14:54.940 --> 2:14:58.660\n or sort of ran that idea by the computer scientists\n\n2:14:58.660 --> 2:15:01.540\n and engineers and product managers that I would talk to,\n\n2:15:01.540 --> 2:15:05.340\n they would say, we thought about that,\n\n2:15:05.340 --> 2:15:09.660\n but that following truck, it's not that simple.\n\n2:15:09.660 --> 2:15:12.620\n That thing, basically we had to engineer that\n\n2:15:12.620 --> 2:15:15.980\n to be capable of independent self driving,\n\n2:15:15.980 --> 2:15:17.660\n because what if there was a cut in\n\n2:15:17.660 --> 2:15:21.660\n or any number of scenarios in which it lost\n\n2:15:21.660 --> 2:15:25.260\n that connection to the lead truck for whatever reason.\n\n2:15:25.260 --> 2:15:26.340\n Now, I mean, I don't know.\n\n2:15:26.340 --> 2:15:29.700\n Boo hoo, platooning is hard.\n\n2:15:29.700 --> 2:15:30.700\n There's edge cases.\n\n2:15:30.700 --> 2:15:33.740\n I guarantee the number of edge cases in platooning\n\n2:15:33.740 --> 2:15:37.380\n is orders of magnitude lower than the number of edge cases\n\n2:15:37.380 --> 2:15:40.660\n in the general solo full self drive.\n\n2:15:40.660 --> 2:15:43.860\n You do not need to solve the full self driving problem.\n\n2:15:43.860 --> 2:15:46.300\n I mean, if you're talking about\n\n2:15:46.300 --> 2:15:49.340\n probability of dangerous events,\n\n2:15:49.340 --> 2:15:50.860\n it just seems with platooning,\n\n2:15:50.860 --> 2:15:54.780\n then like you can deal with cut ins.\n\n2:15:54.780 --> 2:15:56.820\n Yeah, so this is beyond,\n\n2:15:56.820 --> 2:15:59.180\n this is one of the challenge obviously of being a researcher\n\n2:15:59.180 --> 2:16:02.140\n who doesn't really have any background\n\n2:16:02.140 --> 2:16:04.500\n in the technology, right?\n\n2:16:04.500 --> 2:16:05.780\n So I can dream this up.\n\n2:16:05.780 --> 2:16:08.140\n I don't, you know, I have no idea if it's feasible.\n\n2:16:08.140 --> 2:16:10.700\n Well, let me speak, you spoke to the PhDs in economics.\n\n2:16:10.700 --> 2:16:12.940\n Let me speak to the PhDs in computer science.\n\n2:16:12.940 --> 2:16:14.580\n If you think platooning is as hard\n\n2:16:14.580 --> 2:16:16.220\n as the full self driving problem,\n\n2:16:17.940 --> 2:16:20.380\n we need to talk, because I think that's ridiculous.\n\n2:16:20.380 --> 2:16:22.820\n I think platooning, and in fact,\n\n2:16:22.820 --> 2:16:24.500\n I think platooning is an interesting idea\n\n2:16:24.500 --> 2:16:26.700\n for ride sharing as well,\n\n2:16:26.700 --> 2:16:28.420\n for the general autonomous driving problem,\n\n2:16:28.420 --> 2:16:30.380\n not just trucking, but obviously trucking\n\n2:16:30.380 --> 2:16:32.140\n is the big, big benefit,\n\n2:16:32.140 --> 2:16:35.380\n because the number of A to B points in trucking\n\n2:16:35.380 --> 2:16:38.100\n is much, much lower than the general ride sharing problem.\n\n2:16:38.100 --> 2:16:40.460\n But anyway, I think that's a great idea,\n\n2:16:40.460 --> 2:16:42.660\n but you're saying it was removed.\n\n2:16:42.660 --> 2:16:44.980\n Yeah, and so you can go, you know,\n\n2:16:44.980 --> 2:16:47.180\n and listeners could go to these reports.\n\n2:16:47.180 --> 2:16:48.700\n They're publicly available.\n\n2:16:48.700 --> 2:16:51.540\n And they explain why in the footnote.\n\n2:16:51.540 --> 2:16:54.980\n And they note that there was this other scenario\n\n2:16:54.980 --> 2:16:56.140\n suggested by at least me,\n\n2:16:56.140 --> 2:16:58.980\n and I can't remember if they said someone else did too.\n\n2:16:58.980 --> 2:17:01.920\n But they said, you know, we didn't include it\n\n2:17:01.920 --> 2:17:04.980\n because no developers were working on it.\n\n2:17:04.980 --> 2:17:05.860\n Interesting.\n\n2:17:05.860 --> 2:17:07.460\n Full disclosure,\n\n2:17:07.460 --> 2:17:11.100\n that was the approach that I took in my research, right?\n\n2:17:11.100 --> 2:17:13.380\n Which was to go to the developers and say,\n\n2:17:13.380 --> 2:17:14.860\n what's your vision, right?\n\n2:17:14.860 --> 2:17:16.980\n What are you trying to develop?\n\n2:17:17.820 --> 2:17:19.020\n That's what I was trying to do.\n\n2:17:19.020 --> 2:17:20.140\n And maybe, you know,\n\n2:17:20.140 --> 2:17:22.220\n and then I tried to think outside the box at the end\n\n2:17:22.220 --> 2:17:23.300\n by adding that one, right?\n\n2:17:23.300 --> 2:17:24.460\n Like, here's one that I have, you know,\n\n2:17:24.460 --> 2:17:25.960\n people aren't talking about that could be cool.\n\n2:17:25.960 --> 2:17:29.100\n Now, again, it had been proposed in like 2014\n\n2:17:29.100 --> 2:17:31.340\n for like fuel convoys.\n\n2:17:31.340 --> 2:17:35.060\n So you could just have like one super armored lead fuel\n\n2:17:35.060 --> 2:17:35.900\n truck, right?\n\n2:17:35.900 --> 2:17:38.180\n In a, you know, bringing fuel to forward operating bases\n\n2:17:38.180 --> 2:17:39.140\n in Afghanistan.\n\n2:17:39.140 --> 2:17:41.980\n And then you wouldn't need, you know, the super heavy,\n\n2:17:41.980 --> 2:17:43.280\n you know, you wouldn't have to protect the human life\n\n2:17:43.280 --> 2:17:44.120\n in the following truck.\n\n2:17:44.120 --> 2:17:44.960\n So that's interesting.\n\n2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:46.540\n You're saying like, when you talk to Waymo,\n\n2:17:46.540 --> 2:17:48.540\n when you talk to these kinds of companies,\n\n2:17:48.540 --> 2:17:52.100\n they weren't at least openly saying they're working on this.\n\n2:17:52.100 --> 2:17:56.100\n So then it doesn't make sense to include in the list.\n\n2:17:56.100 --> 2:17:56.940\n Yeah.\n\n2:17:56.940 --> 2:17:58.620\n And so, but here's the thing, right?\n\n2:17:58.620 --> 2:18:01.060\n This is the Department of Transportation, right?\n\n2:18:01.060 --> 2:18:03.100\n And the Department of Labor.\n\n2:18:03.100 --> 2:18:04.740\n Maybe they could consider some scenarios.\n\n2:18:04.740 --> 2:18:07.560\n Like maybe we could say, you know, this, we,\n\n2:18:07.560 --> 2:18:08.960\n this technology has got a lot of potential.\n\n2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:10.580\n Here's what we'd like it to do.\n\n2:18:10.580 --> 2:18:12.700\n You know, we'd like it to reduce highway deaths,\n\n2:18:12.700 --> 2:18:14.880\n help us fight climate change, reduce congestion,\n\n2:18:14.880 --> 2:18:16.740\n you know, all these other, other things.\n\n2:18:16.740 --> 2:18:19.100\n But that's not how our policy conversation\n\n2:18:19.100 --> 2:18:20.520\n around technology is happening.\n\n2:18:20.520 --> 2:18:24.660\n We're not, and people don't think that we should.\n\n2:18:24.660 --> 2:18:26.420\n And I think that's the fundamental shift\n\n2:18:26.420 --> 2:18:27.820\n that we need to have, right?\n\n2:18:27.820 --> 2:18:31.740\n I've been involved with this a little bit like NHTSA and DOT.\n\n2:18:31.740 --> 2:18:33.340\n The approach they took is saying,\n\n2:18:33.340 --> 2:18:34.900\n we don't know what the heck we're doing.\n\n2:18:34.900 --> 2:18:38.300\n So we're going to just let the innovators do their thing\n\n2:18:38.300 --> 2:18:41.360\n and not regulate it for a while, just to see.\n\n2:18:41.360 --> 2:18:42.820\n You don't, you think that's,\n\n2:18:43.680 --> 2:18:46.500\n you think DOT should provide ideas themselves.\n\n2:18:46.500 --> 2:18:49.900\n Well, so this is the, this is the great trick\n\n2:18:49.900 --> 2:18:53.660\n in policy of private actors,\n\n2:18:53.660 --> 2:18:58.660\n is you get narrow mandates for government agencies, right?\n\n2:18:58.680 --> 2:19:01.900\n So, you know, the safety case will be handled\n\n2:19:01.900 --> 2:19:04.780\n by organizations whose mandate is safety.\n\n2:19:04.780 --> 2:19:07.780\n So the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration,\n\n2:19:07.780 --> 2:19:11.180\n who is, you know, going to be a key player,\n\n2:19:11.180 --> 2:19:13.540\n I argue in an article that I wrote, you know,\n\n2:19:13.540 --> 2:19:15.620\n they're going to be a key player in actually determining\n\n2:19:15.620 --> 2:19:17.980\n which scenario is most profitable\n\n2:19:17.980 --> 2:19:20.140\n by setting the rules for truck drivers.\n\n2:19:20.140 --> 2:19:22.380\n Their mandate is safety, right?\n\n2:19:22.380 --> 2:19:25.060\n Now they have lots of good people there who want,\n\n2:19:25.060 --> 2:19:26.460\n you know, who care about truck drivers\n\n2:19:26.460 --> 2:19:29.340\n and who wish truck drivers jobs were better,\n\n2:19:29.340 --> 2:19:32.860\n but they don't have the authority to say,\n\n2:19:32.860 --> 2:19:34.020\n hey, we're going to write this rule\n\n2:19:34.020 --> 2:19:35.580\n because it's good for truck drivers, right?\n\n2:19:35.580 --> 2:19:40.300\n And so when you, you know, we need to say,\n\n2:19:40.300 --> 2:19:44.020\n you know, as a society, we need to not restrict technology,\n\n2:19:44.020 --> 2:19:45.620\n not stand in the way of things.\n\n2:19:45.620 --> 2:19:48.860\n We need to harness it towards the goals that matter, right?\n\n2:19:48.860 --> 2:19:52.060\n Not whatever comes out the end of the pipeline\n\n2:19:52.060 --> 2:19:53.780\n because it's the easiest thing to develop\n\n2:19:53.780 --> 2:19:57.060\n or whatever is most profitable for the first actor\n\n2:19:57.060 --> 2:19:58.740\n or whatever, but, you know, and we do,\n\n2:19:58.740 --> 2:20:00.740\n the thing is we do that, right?\n\n2:20:00.740 --> 2:20:04.220\n I mean, like when we sent people to the moon,\n\n2:20:04.220 --> 2:20:06.140\n you know, we did that,\n\n2:20:06.140 --> 2:20:07.820\n and there were tremendous benefits\n\n2:20:07.820 --> 2:20:09.380\n that followed from it, right?\n\n2:20:09.380 --> 2:20:11.420\n And we do this all the time in, you know,\n\n2:20:11.420 --> 2:20:13.580\n trying to cure cancer or whatever it is, right?\n\n2:20:13.580 --> 2:20:17.220\n I mean, we can do this, right?\n\n2:20:17.220 --> 2:20:21.940\n Now the interesting sort of epilogue to that story is,\n\n2:20:21.940 --> 2:20:25.180\n you know, six months or so, I don't know how long it was,\n\n2:20:25.180 --> 2:20:28.220\n after those meetings in which that sixth scenario\n\n2:20:28.220 --> 2:20:32.780\n was not considered, a company called Locomation,\n\n2:20:33.780 --> 2:20:36.660\n you know, ends up using that,\n\n2:20:36.660 --> 2:20:39.940\n essentially that basic scenario with a slight variation.\n\n2:20:39.940 --> 2:20:43.780\n So they leave the human driver in both trucks\n\n2:20:43.780 --> 2:20:46.100\n and then that following driver goes off duty.\n\n2:20:46.100 --> 2:20:50.020\n And then, you know, I've been trying to think\n\n2:20:50.020 --> 2:20:50.940\n of what the term is, they kind of,\n\n2:20:50.940 --> 2:20:52.860\n I think of it as like slingshotting,\n\n2:20:52.860 --> 2:20:54.460\n they sort of, when one runs out of hours,\n\n2:20:54.460 --> 2:20:56.500\n you know, the one who's off duty goes in front and,\n\n2:20:56.500 --> 2:21:00.540\n you know, and so, you know, if only they had been,\n\n2:21:01.380 --> 2:21:04.380\n you know, around six months earlier,\n\n2:21:04.380 --> 2:21:06.460\n that might've been considered by the OT,\n\n2:21:06.460 --> 2:21:08.620\n but it just says, you know, who has the authority\n\n2:21:08.620 --> 2:21:10.820\n to propose what these visions of the future are?\n\n2:21:10.820 --> 2:21:13.740\n Well, some of it is also just the company stepping up\n\n2:21:13.740 --> 2:21:16.300\n and just doing it, screw the authority,\n\n2:21:16.300 --> 2:21:18.020\n and showing that it's possible,\n\n2:21:18.020 --> 2:21:19.660\n and then the authority follows.\n\n2:21:19.660 --> 2:21:24.660\n So that's why I really love innovators in the space.\n\n2:21:24.740 --> 2:21:29.460\n The criticism I have, the very sort of real,\n\n2:21:29.460 --> 2:21:31.020\n I don't know, harsh criticism I have\n\n2:21:31.020 --> 2:21:34.380\n towards autonomous vehicle companies in the space\n\n2:21:34.380 --> 2:21:37.140\n is they've gotten culturally,\n\n2:21:38.140 --> 2:21:41.380\n they've, it's become acceptable somehow\n\n2:21:42.780 --> 2:21:45.380\n to do demos and videos,\n\n2:21:46.260 --> 2:21:48.740\n as opposed to the old school American way\n\n2:21:48.740 --> 2:21:50.580\n of solving problems.\n\n2:21:50.580 --> 2:21:53.220\n There's a culture in Silicon Valley\n\n2:21:53.220 --> 2:21:54.820\n where you're talking to VCs\n\n2:21:56.100 --> 2:22:01.100\n that have lost that kind of love of solving problems.\n\n2:22:01.860 --> 2:22:03.700\n They kind of like envision,\n\n2:22:03.700 --> 2:22:07.340\n if the story you told me in your PowerPoint presentation\n\n2:22:07.340 --> 2:22:09.380\n is true, how many trillions of dollars\n\n2:22:09.380 --> 2:22:10.700\n might I be able to make?\n\n2:22:10.700 --> 2:22:13.220\n There's something lost in that conversation\n\n2:22:13.220 --> 2:22:16.900\n where you're not really taking on like the problem\n\n2:22:16.900 --> 2:22:19.660\n in a real way, so these autonomous vehicle companies\n\n2:22:19.660 --> 2:22:21.020\n realize we don't need to,\n\n2:22:21.020 --> 2:22:24.140\n we just need to make nice PowerPoint presentations\n\n2:22:24.140 --> 2:22:26.020\n and not actually deliver products\n\n2:22:26.020 --> 2:22:29.380\n that like everybody looks outside and says,\n\n2:22:29.380 --> 2:22:31.980\n holy shit, this is life changing.\n\n2:22:31.980 --> 2:22:34.180\n This is where I have to give props to Waymo\n\n2:22:34.180 --> 2:22:37.980\n is they put driverless cars on the road\n\n2:22:37.980 --> 2:22:41.500\n and like forget PowerPoint slide presentations,\n\n2:22:41.500 --> 2:22:42.540\n actual cars on the road.\n\n2:22:42.540 --> 2:22:43.980\n Then you can criticize like,\n\n2:22:43.980 --> 2:22:45.580\n is that actually going to work?\n\n2:22:45.580 --> 2:22:48.300\n Who knows, but the thing is they have cars on the road\n\n2:22:48.300 --> 2:22:49.780\n and that's why I have to give props to Tesla.\n\n2:22:49.780 --> 2:22:52.940\n They have whatever you want to say about risk\n\n2:22:52.940 --> 2:22:54.180\n and all those kinds of things,\n\n2:22:54.180 --> 2:22:55.700\n they have cars on the road\n\n2:22:55.700 --> 2:22:57.380\n that have some level of automation\n\n2:22:57.380 --> 2:23:00.260\n and soon they have trucks on the road as well.\n\n2:23:00.260 --> 2:23:03.900\n And that kind of, that component,\n\n2:23:03.900 --> 2:23:06.780\n I think is important part of the policy conversation\n\n2:23:06.780 --> 2:23:10.300\n because you start getting data from these companies\n\n2:23:10.300 --> 2:23:12.140\n that are willing to take the big risks\n\n2:23:12.140 --> 2:23:14.380\n as opposed to making slide decks,\n\n2:23:14.380 --> 2:23:16.620\n they're actually putting cars on the road\n\n2:23:16.620 --> 2:23:19.340\n and like real lives are at stake.\n\n2:23:19.340 --> 2:23:21.980\n They could be lost and they could bankrupt the company\n\n2:23:21.980 --> 2:23:23.500\n if they make the wrong decisions.\n\n2:23:23.500 --> 2:23:25.900\n And that's deeply admirable to me.\n\n2:23:25.900 --> 2:23:28.940\n Speaking of which I have to ask Waymo trucks,\n\n2:23:28.940 --> 2:23:31.020\n I think it's called Waymo Via.\n\n2:23:31.980 --> 2:23:34.660\n So I'm talking to the head of trucking at Waymo.\n\n2:23:34.660 --> 2:23:35.620\n I don't know if you've gotten a chance\n\n2:23:35.620 --> 2:23:37.380\n to interact with them.\n\n2:23:37.380 --> 2:23:39.500\n What's a good question to ask the guy?\n\n2:23:39.500 --> 2:23:41.340\n What's a good question of Waymo?\n\n2:23:41.340 --> 2:23:45.060\n Because they seem to be one of the leaders in the space.\n\n2:23:45.060 --> 2:23:47.700\n They have the zen like calm\n\n2:23:47.700 --> 2:23:51.540\n of like being willing to stick with it for the longterm\n\n2:23:51.540 --> 2:23:53.340\n in order to solve the problem.\n\n2:23:53.340 --> 2:23:55.860\n Yeah, and I guess they have that luxury, right?\n\n2:23:56.860 --> 2:23:58.420\n Which I don't think I,\n\n2:23:59.380 --> 2:24:01.860\n if I had another life as a researcher,\n\n2:24:01.860 --> 2:24:05.380\n I would love to just study the business strategies\n\n2:24:05.380 --> 2:24:10.020\n of startups and Silicon Valley sort of structure.\n\n2:24:10.020 --> 2:24:12.180\n Would you consider Waymo a startup?\n\n2:24:12.180 --> 2:24:13.020\n No.\n\n2:24:13.020 --> 2:24:13.860\n No.\n\n2:24:13.860 --> 2:24:14.700\n No, right?\n\n2:24:14.700 --> 2:24:16.260\n I mean, it's at least not in the things\n\n2:24:16.260 --> 2:24:18.940\n that seem to matter in this self driving space.\n\n2:24:18.940 --> 2:24:20.700\n So you mentioned the demos,\n\n2:24:21.980 --> 2:24:24.340\n and I don't have enough data as a sociologist\n\n2:24:24.340 --> 2:24:27.260\n to really say like, oh, this is why they do what they do.\n\n2:24:27.260 --> 2:24:30.020\n But my hypothesis is,\n\n2:24:30.020 --> 2:24:33.500\n there's a real scarcity of talent and money for this.\n\n2:24:33.500 --> 2:24:36.260\n And there certainly was a scarcity of like partnerships\n\n2:24:36.260 --> 2:24:39.940\n with OEMs and the big trucking companies.\n\n2:24:39.940 --> 2:24:42.020\n And there was a race for it, right?\n\n2:24:42.020 --> 2:24:47.020\n And the way that if you don't have the backing of Alphabet,\n\n2:24:47.900 --> 2:24:49.820\n you do a demo, right?\n\n2:24:49.820 --> 2:24:52.060\n And you get a few more good engineers who say,\n\n2:24:52.060 --> 2:24:54.060\n hey, look, they did that cool thing.\n\n2:24:54.060 --> 2:24:56.700\n Like Anthony Levandowski did with Otto\n\n2:24:56.700 --> 2:25:00.140\n and that resulted in the Uber purchase of that program.\n\n2:25:01.700 --> 2:25:03.220\n So what would I ask?\n\n2:25:03.220 --> 2:25:06.580\n I mean, I think I would ask a lot of questions,\n\n2:25:06.580 --> 2:25:07.420\n but I think the markets.\n\n2:25:07.420 --> 2:25:09.780\n Well, there's also on record and off record conversations\n\n2:25:09.780 --> 2:25:11.420\n which unfortunately,\n\n2:25:11.420 --> 2:25:14.300\n I'm asking for an on record conversation.\n\n2:25:14.300 --> 2:25:18.700\n And that I don't know if these companies\n\n2:25:18.700 --> 2:25:21.780\n are willing to have interesting on record conversations.\n\n2:25:21.780 --> 2:25:24.780\n Yeah, I mean, I assume that like there are questions\n\n2:25:24.780 --> 2:25:26.180\n that I don't think you'd have to ask.\n\n2:25:26.180 --> 2:25:28.620\n Like I assume they're gonna be actually driverless, right?\n\n2:25:28.620 --> 2:25:31.220\n They're not gonna like keep the driver in there.\n\n2:25:31.220 --> 2:25:33.460\n So I mean, for the industry,\n\n2:25:33.460 --> 2:25:35.660\n I think it would be interesting to know\n\n2:25:36.580 --> 2:25:39.380\n where they see that first adopter, right?\n\n2:25:39.380 --> 2:25:42.020\n Oh, you mean from like the scenarios that laid out\n\n2:25:42.020 --> 2:25:44.060\n which one are they going to take on?\n\n2:25:44.060 --> 2:25:45.820\n Yeah, I mean, cause that's gonna,\n\n2:25:45.820 --> 2:25:48.500\n again, it's those really expensive good jobs, right?\n\n2:25:48.500 --> 2:25:51.380\n So those LTL jobs, the like UPS jobs.\n\n2:25:51.380 --> 2:25:54.060\n Now that's gonna be, that's where labor is too, right?\n\n2:25:54.060 --> 2:25:54.980\n That's where the teamsters are.\n\n2:25:54.980 --> 2:25:57.220\n That's the only place they are left, right?\n\n2:25:57.220 --> 2:26:00.460\n So that's gonna be the big fight on the hill\n\n2:26:00.460 --> 2:26:03.300\n and if labor can muster it, right?\n\n2:26:03.300 --> 2:26:04.140\n I don't know.\n\n2:26:04.940 --> 2:26:06.460\n There's a really cool,\n\n2:26:06.460 --> 2:26:10.340\n like one thing I would recommend to you and your listeners,\n\n2:26:10.340 --> 2:26:13.180\n if you really wanna see some like a remarkable page\n\n2:26:13.180 --> 2:26:15.860\n in sort of the history of labor and automation,\n\n2:26:15.860 --> 2:26:18.780\n there's a report that Harry Bridges,\n\n2:26:18.780 --> 2:26:23.620\n who was the socialist leader of the Longshoremen\n\n2:26:23.620 --> 2:26:26.300\n on the West Coast and just, you know, galvanize that union\n\n2:26:26.300 --> 2:26:28.340\n and they still control the ports today\n\n2:26:28.340 --> 2:26:31.860\n because of the sort of vision that he laid down.\n\n2:26:31.860 --> 2:26:35.780\n In the 1960s, he put out a photo journal report\n\n2:26:35.780 --> 2:26:39.220\n called Men and Machines and basically what it was,\n\n2:26:39.220 --> 2:26:42.060\n was it was an internal education campaign\n\n2:26:42.060 --> 2:26:44.020\n to convince the membership\n\n2:26:44.020 --> 2:26:46.700\n that they had to go along with automation.\n\n2:26:46.700 --> 2:26:48.260\n Machines were coming for their jobs\n\n2:26:48.260 --> 2:26:49.900\n and what the photo journal,\n\n2:26:49.900 --> 2:26:51.900\n it's almost like a hundred pages or something like that\n\n2:26:51.900 --> 2:26:54.100\n is like, here's how we used to do it.\n\n2:26:54.100 --> 2:26:56.140\n Some of you old timers remember it.\n\n2:26:56.140 --> 2:26:58.620\n Like we used to take the barrels of olive oil\n\n2:26:58.620 --> 2:27:01.500\n and we'd stack them in the hold and we'd roll them by hand\n\n2:27:01.500 --> 2:27:03.340\n and we'd put the timber in and we'd, you know,\n\n2:27:03.340 --> 2:27:05.620\n stack the crates tight, you know,\n\n2:27:05.620 --> 2:27:07.620\n and that was the pride of the Longshoremen,\n\n2:27:07.620 --> 2:27:09.980\n was a tight stow.\n\n2:27:09.980 --> 2:27:12.020\n And now you all know, you know,\n\n2:27:12.020 --> 2:27:13.300\n there are cranes that come down\n\n2:27:13.300 --> 2:27:15.540\n and there's no longer any, you know, rope slings\n\n2:27:15.540 --> 2:27:17.740\n and we're loading bulldozers into the hold\n\n2:27:17.740 --> 2:27:19.660\n to push the ore up into piles\n\n2:27:19.660 --> 2:27:21.180\n and then clamshells are coming down\n\n2:27:21.180 --> 2:27:25.140\n and he made this case to them and he said,\n\n2:27:25.140 --> 2:27:27.820\n this is why we're signing this agreement\n\n2:27:27.820 --> 2:27:32.820\n to basically allow the employer to automate\n\n2:27:33.140 --> 2:27:34.740\n and we're gonna lose jobs,\n\n2:27:34.740 --> 2:27:37.660\n but we're gonna get a share of the benefits.\n\n2:27:37.660 --> 2:27:39.300\n And so our wages are gonna go up.\n\n2:27:39.300 --> 2:27:41.100\n We're gonna continue to control the hiring\n\n2:27:41.100 --> 2:27:42.620\n and training of workers.\n\n2:27:42.620 --> 2:27:44.060\n Our numbers are gonna go down,\n\n2:27:44.060 --> 2:27:46.500\n but you know, basically that last son of a bitch\n\n2:27:46.500 --> 2:27:48.060\n who's working at the ports,\n\n2:27:48.060 --> 2:27:51.500\n he's gonna be one really well paid son of a bitch,\n\n2:27:51.500 --> 2:27:53.900\n you know, he may just be one standing,\n\n2:27:53.900 --> 2:27:55.580\n but he's gonna love his job.\n\n2:27:56.660 --> 2:27:57.860\n You should check out that report.\n\n2:27:57.860 --> 2:27:59.700\n That's an interesting vision of a future\n\n2:27:59.700 --> 2:28:01.940\n that probably still holds.\n\n2:28:01.940 --> 2:28:04.140\n That is, I mean, there is some level\n\n2:28:04.140 --> 2:28:07.100\n to which you have to embrace the automation.\n\n2:28:07.100 --> 2:28:08.540\n Yeah, I mean, and who gets, you know,\n\n2:28:08.540 --> 2:28:09.500\n it's the benefits, right?\n\n2:28:09.500 --> 2:28:12.060\n It's like, I mean, think of the public dollars\n\n2:28:12.060 --> 2:28:14.020\n that went into developing self driving vehicles\n\n2:28:14.020 --> 2:28:14.900\n in the early days, right?\n\n2:28:14.900 --> 2:28:16.260\n Not just the vision of it, right?\n\n2:28:16.260 --> 2:28:18.860\n Which was a public vision to, you know,\n\n2:28:18.860 --> 2:28:20.500\n take soldiers out of harm's way,\n\n2:28:21.580 --> 2:28:24.780\n but you know, a lot of money.\n\n2:28:24.780 --> 2:28:27.340\n And there's some way if you are a business\n\n2:28:27.340 --> 2:28:29.660\n that's leveraging the technology\n\n2:28:29.660 --> 2:28:33.780\n from a broad historical ethical perspective,\n\n2:28:33.780 --> 2:28:38.780\n you do owe it to the bigger community to pay back,\n\n2:28:41.260 --> 2:28:44.940\n like for all the investment that was paid\n\n2:28:44.940 --> 2:28:47.180\n to make that technology a reality.\n\n2:28:47.180 --> 2:28:50.940\n In some sense, I don't know how to make that right, right?\n\n2:28:50.940 --> 2:28:54.300\n On one, there's this pure capitalism\n\n2:28:54.300 --> 2:28:57.300\n and then there's communism and I'm not sure,\n\n2:28:57.300 --> 2:29:02.300\n I'm not sure how to get that balance right.\n\n2:29:04.380 --> 2:29:06.260\n You know, I don't have all the answers in here,\n\n2:29:06.260 --> 2:29:09.100\n you know, and I wouldn't expect, you know,\n\n2:29:09.100 --> 2:29:11.940\n individual private companies to kind of kick back, right?\n\n2:29:11.940 --> 2:29:14.060\n That's, capitalism doesn't allow that, right?\n\n2:29:14.060 --> 2:29:15.820\n Unless you have a huge monopoly, right?\n\n2:29:15.820 --> 2:29:17.540\n And then you can on the backside,\n\n2:29:17.540 --> 2:29:20.260\n create music halls and libraries and things like that.\n\n2:29:21.260 --> 2:29:23.500\n But you know, here's what I think, you know,\n\n2:29:23.500 --> 2:29:28.500\n the basic obligation is, is, you know, come to the table,\n\n2:29:28.860 --> 2:29:31.820\n like, and have an honest conversation\n\n2:29:31.820 --> 2:29:35.820\n with the policymakers, with the truck drivers, you know,\n\n2:29:35.820 --> 2:29:37.940\n with the communities that are at risk.\n\n2:29:37.940 --> 2:29:41.860\n Like, at least let's talk about these things, you know,\n\n2:29:41.860 --> 2:29:43.500\n in a way that doesn't look like\n\n2:29:43.500 --> 2:29:45.340\n the way lobbying works right now.\n\n2:29:45.340 --> 2:29:49.140\n Where you send a well paid lobbyist to the Hill\n\n2:29:49.140 --> 2:29:52.580\n to, you know, convince some representative or Senator\n\n2:29:52.580 --> 2:29:55.300\n to stick a sentence or two in that favors you into the,\n\n2:29:55.300 --> 2:29:57.780\n like, let's have a real conversation.\n\n2:29:57.780 --> 2:29:58.620\n Real human conversation.\n\n2:29:58.620 --> 2:29:59.460\n Can we just do that?\n\n2:29:59.460 --> 2:30:01.420\n Yeah, don't play games.\n\n2:30:01.420 --> 2:30:03.220\n Real, real human conversation.\n\n2:30:03.220 --> 2:30:06.500\n Let me ask you, mention Autopilot.\n\n2:30:06.500 --> 2:30:10.100\n Gotta ask you about Tesla, this renegade little company\n\n2:30:10.100 --> 2:30:12.220\n that seems to be, from my perspective,\n\n2:30:12.220 --> 2:30:13.820\n revolutionizing autonomous driving\n\n2:30:13.820 --> 2:30:15.020\n or semi autonomous driving,\n\n2:30:15.020 --> 2:30:18.540\n or at least the problem of perception and control.\n\n2:30:19.820 --> 2:30:22.140\n They've got a semi on the way.\n\n2:30:22.140 --> 2:30:24.300\n They got a truck on the way.\n\n2:30:24.300 --> 2:30:26.580\n What are your thoughts about Tesla Semi?\n\n2:30:26.580 --> 2:30:29.140\n You know, I, and I did have\n\n2:30:29.140 --> 2:30:31.180\n some very preliminary conversations\n\n2:30:31.180 --> 2:30:35.020\n with, you know, policy folks there.\n\n2:30:35.020 --> 2:30:37.260\n You know, nothing really in the tech\n\n2:30:37.260 --> 2:30:39.980\n or business side of it too much.\n\n2:30:39.980 --> 2:30:40.980\n And here's why.\n\n2:30:40.980 --> 2:30:43.900\n I think because electrification and autonomy\n\n2:30:43.900 --> 2:30:45.260\n run in opposite directions.\n\n2:30:46.140 --> 2:30:49.980\n And I just, you know, I don't see the application,\n\n2:30:49.980 --> 2:30:52.580\n the value in self driving for the truck\n\n2:30:52.580 --> 2:30:55.500\n that Tesla's gonna produce in the near term.\n\n2:30:55.500 --> 2:30:58.820\n You know, they're just, you're not gonna have the battery.\n\n2:30:58.820 --> 2:31:01.220\n And now you could have wonderful safety systems\n\n2:31:01.220 --> 2:31:03.900\n and, you know, reinforcing, you know, the auto,\n\n2:31:03.900 --> 2:31:08.900\n you know, self driving features supporting a skilled driver,\n\n2:31:08.900 --> 2:31:11.140\n but you're not gonna be able to pull that driver out\n\n2:31:11.140 --> 2:31:12.940\n for long stretches the way that you are\n\n2:31:12.940 --> 2:31:14.260\n with driverless trucks.\n\n2:31:14.260 --> 2:31:18.460\n So do you think, I mean, the reason,\n\n2:31:18.460 --> 2:31:21.020\n so yeah, the electrification\n\n2:31:22.380 --> 2:31:24.740\n is not obviously coupled with the automation.\n\n2:31:27.780 --> 2:31:29.860\n They have a very interesting approach\n\n2:31:29.860 --> 2:31:34.860\n to semi autonomous pushing towards autonomous driving.\n\n2:31:35.060 --> 2:31:36.780\n All right, it's very unique.\n\n2:31:37.900 --> 2:31:41.260\n No LIDAR, now no radar.\n\n2:31:41.260 --> 2:31:44.260\n It's computer vision alone from a large,\n\n2:31:44.260 --> 2:31:47.100\n they're collecting huge amounts of data from a large fleet.\n\n2:31:47.100 --> 2:31:49.460\n It's an interesting, unique approach,\n\n2:31:49.460 --> 2:31:51.740\n bold and fearless in this direction.\n\n2:31:51.740 --> 2:31:55.260\n If I were to guess whether this approach would work,\n\n2:31:55.260 --> 2:31:58.260\n I would say, no, it started.\n\n2:31:59.380 --> 2:32:01.500\n One, you would need a lot of data\n\n2:32:01.500 --> 2:32:05.100\n and two, because you have actual cars deployed on the road\n\n2:32:05.100 --> 2:32:07.940\n using a beta version of this product,\n\n2:32:07.940 --> 2:32:11.980\n you're going to have a system that's far less safe\n\n2:32:11.980 --> 2:32:13.380\n and you're going to run into trouble.\n\n2:32:13.380 --> 2:32:17.580\n It's horrible PR, like it just seems like a nightmare,\n\n2:32:17.580 --> 2:32:20.620\n but it seems to not be the case, at least up to this point.\n\n2:32:20.620 --> 2:32:25.620\n It seems to be not, you know, on par, if not safer\n\n2:32:26.420 --> 2:32:27.740\n and it seems to work really well\n\n2:32:27.740 --> 2:32:32.020\n and the human factor somehow manages,\n\n2:32:32.020 --> 2:32:33.820\n like drivers still pay attention.\n\n2:32:33.820 --> 2:32:36.660\n Now there's a selection of who is inside\n\n2:32:36.660 --> 2:32:39.820\n the Tesla autopilot user base, right?\n\n2:32:39.820 --> 2:32:42.140\n There could be a self selection mechanism there,\n\n2:32:42.140 --> 2:32:43.820\n but however it works,\n\n2:32:43.820 --> 2:32:47.300\n these things are not running off the road all the time.\n\n2:32:47.300 --> 2:32:50.580\n So it's very interesting whether that can sort of creep\n\n2:32:50.580 --> 2:32:52.100\n into the trucking space.\n\n2:32:52.940 --> 2:32:57.940\n Yes, at first the long haul problem is not solved.\n\n2:32:57.980 --> 2:33:01.260\n They need to charge, but maybe you can solve, you know,\n\n2:33:01.260 --> 2:33:06.260\n a lot of your scenarios involved small distances\n\n2:33:06.940 --> 2:33:10.220\n and you know, that last mile aspect,\n\n2:33:10.220 --> 2:33:12.140\n which is exactly what Tesla is trying to solve\n\n2:33:12.140 --> 2:33:17.140\n for the regular passenger vehicle space\n\n2:33:18.620 --> 2:33:20.420\n is the city driving.\n\n2:33:20.420 --> 2:33:22.620\n It's possible that you have these trucks.\n\n2:33:22.620 --> 2:33:27.620\n It's almost like, yeah, you solved the last mile delivery\n\n2:33:28.220 --> 2:33:31.300\n part of some of the scenarios that you mentioned\n\n2:33:31.300 --> 2:33:32.780\n in autonomous driving space.\n\n2:33:32.780 --> 2:33:35.940\n Is that, do you think that's from the people you've spoken\n\n2:33:35.940 --> 2:33:37.580\n with too difficult of a problem?\n\n2:33:37.580 --> 2:33:41.540\n The thing that, you know, keeps me so interested\n\n2:33:41.540 --> 2:33:43.580\n in this space and thinking that it's so important,\n\n2:33:43.580 --> 2:33:46.900\n you know, is again, that efficiency question,\n\n2:33:46.900 --> 2:33:50.940\n that safety question and the way that these economics\n\n2:33:50.940 --> 2:33:53.180\n can push us potentially, you know,\n\n2:33:53.180 --> 2:33:54.780\n toward a more efficient system.\n\n2:33:54.780 --> 2:33:58.140\n So I wanna see those Tesla electric trucks running out\n\n2:33:58.140 --> 2:34:01.380\n to those truck ports where you've got those two,\n\n2:34:01.380 --> 2:34:05.620\n you know, two trucks with a human driver in front, right?\n\n2:34:05.620 --> 2:34:08.500\n You know, I think that's now what's powering those\n\n2:34:08.500 --> 2:34:11.300\n is that hydrogen, you know, I mean, I don't, you know,\n\n2:34:11.300 --> 2:34:13.100\n again, it's very interesting as a researcher\n\n2:34:13.100 --> 2:34:14.620\n who does not have a background in technology\n\n2:34:14.620 --> 2:34:18.500\n and doesn't have a horse, you know, in this race.\n\n2:34:18.500 --> 2:34:20.620\n I mean, you know, for all I know,\n\n2:34:20.620 --> 2:34:22.780\n self driving trucks will ultimately be achieved\n\n2:34:22.780 --> 2:34:26.580\n by some biomechanical sensor that uses echolocation\n\n2:34:26.580 --> 2:34:28.460\n because we took stem cells of bats.\n\n2:34:28.460 --> 2:34:30.980\n And you know, I mean, I don't, I don't,\n\n2:34:30.980 --> 2:34:35.540\n I am completely unable to assess who's, you know,\n\n2:34:35.540 --> 2:34:37.820\n who's the head or who's behind or who makes sense.\n\n2:34:37.820 --> 2:34:39.940\n But I think one key component there,\n\n2:34:39.940 --> 2:34:42.580\n and this is what I see with Tesla often,\n\n2:34:42.580 --> 2:34:45.600\n and it's quite sad to me that other companies\n\n2:34:45.600 --> 2:34:49.580\n don't do this enough, is that first principles thinking,\n\n2:34:49.580 --> 2:34:51.180\n like, wait, wait, wait, okay.\n\n2:34:51.180 --> 2:34:54.140\n It's looking at the inefficiencies as opposed to,\n\n2:34:54.140 --> 2:34:57.060\n I've worked with quite a few car companies\n\n2:34:57.060 --> 2:35:00.300\n and they basically have a lot of meetings.\n\n2:35:00.300 --> 2:35:01.820\n There's a lot of meetings.\n\n2:35:01.820 --> 2:35:03.300\n And the discussion is like,\n\n2:35:03.300 --> 2:35:05.580\n how can we make this cheaper, this cheaper, this cheaper,\n\n2:35:05.580 --> 2:35:07.420\n this component cheaper, this cheaper,\n\n2:35:07.420 --> 2:35:10.260\n the cheapification of everything, just like you said,\n\n2:35:10.260 --> 2:35:13.180\n as opposed to saying, wait a minute, let's step back.\n\n2:35:13.180 --> 2:35:15.780\n Let's look at the entirety of the inefficiencies\n\n2:35:15.780 --> 2:35:17.260\n in the system.\n\n2:35:17.260 --> 2:35:19.220\n Like, why have we been doing this like this\n\n2:35:19.220 --> 2:35:20.940\n for the last few decades?\n\n2:35:20.940 --> 2:35:22.620\n Like, start from scratch.\n\n2:35:22.620 --> 2:35:25.420\n Can this be 10X, 100X cheaper?\n\n2:35:25.420 --> 2:35:29.780\n Like, if we not just decrease the cost\n\n2:35:29.780 --> 2:35:32.260\n of one component here or this component here\n\n2:35:32.260 --> 2:35:33.620\n or this component here,\n\n2:35:33.620 --> 2:35:37.900\n but like, let's like redesign everything.\n\n2:35:37.900 --> 2:35:42.900\n Let's infrastructure, let's have special lanes\n\n2:35:42.900 --> 2:35:45.180\n or in terms of truck ports,\n\n2:35:45.180 --> 2:35:47.540\n as opposed to having regular human control truck ports,\n\n2:35:47.540 --> 2:35:51.700\n have some kind of weird like sensors,\n\n2:35:51.700 --> 2:35:56.020\n like where everything about the truck connecting\n\n2:35:56.020 --> 2:35:58.780\n at that final destination is automated fully\n\n2:35:58.780 --> 2:35:59.780\n from the ground up.\n\n2:35:59.780 --> 2:36:01.620\n You build the facility from the ground up\n\n2:36:01.620 --> 2:36:03.460\n for the autonomous truck.\n\n2:36:03.460 --> 2:36:06.820\n All those kinds of sort of questions are platooning.\n\n2:36:06.820 --> 2:36:08.140\n Let's say, wait a minute.\n\n2:36:08.140 --> 2:36:11.260\n Okay, I know we think platooning is hard,\n\n2:36:11.260 --> 2:36:14.380\n but can we think through exactly why it's hard\n\n2:36:14.380 --> 2:36:15.980\n and can we actually solve it?\n\n2:36:15.980 --> 2:36:19.140\n Like if we collect a huge amount of data, can we solve it?\n\n2:36:20.460 --> 2:36:23.380\n And then teleoperation, like, okay, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:36:23.380 --> 2:36:25.460\n It's difficult to have good signal,\n\n2:36:25.460 --> 2:36:27.740\n but can we actually, can we have,\n\n2:36:27.740 --> 2:36:31.300\n can we consider the probability of those edge cases\n\n2:36:31.300 --> 2:36:32.420\n and what to do in the edge cases\n\n2:36:32.420 --> 2:36:34.220\n when the teleoperation fails?\n\n2:36:34.220 --> 2:36:35.300\n Like how difficult is this?\n\n2:36:35.300 --> 2:36:36.300\n What are the costs?\n\n2:36:36.300 --> 2:36:39.580\n How do we actually construct a teleoperation center\n\n2:36:39.580 --> 2:36:41.740\n full of humans that are able to pay attention\n\n2:36:41.740 --> 2:36:44.700\n to a large fleet where the average number of vehicles\n\n2:36:44.700 --> 2:36:46.700\n per human is like 10 or a hundred?\n\n2:36:47.700 --> 2:36:52.100\n Like having that conversation as opposed to kind of having,\n\n2:36:52.100 --> 2:36:54.340\n you show up to work and say, all right,\n\n2:36:55.820 --> 2:36:58.580\n it seems like because of COVID,\n\n2:36:58.580 --> 2:37:00.540\n we are not making as much money.\n\n2:37:00.540 --> 2:37:02.220\n Can we have a cheaper,\n\n2:37:02.220 --> 2:37:04.660\n can we give less salary to the trucker?\n\n2:37:04.660 --> 2:37:09.660\n And can we build like decrease the cost\n\n2:37:11.020 --> 2:37:14.580\n or decrease the frequency at which we buy new trucks?\n\n2:37:14.580 --> 2:37:16.300\n And when we do buy new trucks,\n\n2:37:16.300 --> 2:37:18.540\n make them cheaper by making them crappier,\n\n2:37:18.540 --> 2:37:20.140\n like this kind of discussion.\n\n2:37:20.140 --> 2:37:23.220\n This is why, to me, it's like Tesla is like rare on this.\n\n2:37:23.220 --> 2:37:26.180\n And there's some sectors in which innovation\n\n2:37:26.180 --> 2:37:27.580\n is part of the culture.\n\n2:37:27.580 --> 2:37:29.260\n In the automotive sector, for some reason,\n\n2:37:29.260 --> 2:37:31.180\n it's not as much.\n\n2:37:31.180 --> 2:37:33.780\n This is obviously the problem that Ford and GM\n\n2:37:33.780 --> 2:37:34.620\n are struggling with.\n\n2:37:34.620 --> 2:37:39.300\n It's like, they're really good at making cars at scale cheap.\n\n2:37:39.300 --> 2:37:41.220\n And they're like legit good.\n\n2:37:41.220 --> 2:37:42.580\n Like Toyota at this,\n\n2:37:42.580 --> 2:37:44.500\n they're some of the greatest manufacturing people\n\n2:37:44.500 --> 2:37:45.340\n in the world, right?\n\n2:37:45.340 --> 2:37:46.180\n That's incredible.\n\n2:37:46.180 --> 2:37:48.820\n But then when it comes to hiring software people,\n\n2:37:48.820 --> 2:37:49.660\n they're horrible.\n\n2:37:49.660 --> 2:37:52.940\n So it's culture.\n\n2:37:52.940 --> 2:37:55.140\n And then it's such a difficult thing\n\n2:37:55.140 --> 2:37:57.060\n for them to sort of embrace,\n\n2:37:57.060 --> 2:38:00.220\n but greatness requires that they embrace this,\n\n2:38:01.340 --> 2:38:03.100\n embrace whatever is required\n\n2:38:03.100 --> 2:38:04.980\n to remove the inefficiencies in the system.\n\n2:38:04.980 --> 2:38:07.620\n And that may require you to do things very differently\n\n2:38:07.620 --> 2:38:09.420\n than you've done in the past.\n\n2:38:09.420 --> 2:38:12.020\n Yeah, I mean, there are certain things\n\n2:38:12.020 --> 2:38:13.260\n that the market can do well.\n\n2:38:13.260 --> 2:38:15.500\n And this is how I see the world, right?\n\n2:38:17.620 --> 2:38:21.460\n That's the best way to organize certain kinds of activities\n\n2:38:21.460 --> 2:38:24.260\n is the market and private interest.\n\n2:38:24.260 --> 2:38:28.780\n But I think we go too far in some areas.\n\n2:38:28.780 --> 2:38:30.140\n Transportation is,\n\n2:38:30.140 --> 2:38:35.140\n if we can't have a public debate about the roads\n\n2:38:35.860 --> 2:38:37.700\n that we all pay for,\n\n2:38:39.100 --> 2:38:39.940\n forget about it.\n\n2:38:39.940 --> 2:38:41.820\n Private factories and all these other,\n\n2:38:41.820 --> 2:38:43.060\n healthcare and other places,\n\n2:38:43.060 --> 2:38:45.300\n it's gonna be way harder there.\n\n2:38:45.300 --> 2:38:49.620\n Healthcare I guess has some direct contact\n\n2:38:49.620 --> 2:38:52.900\n with the consumer where we're probably gonna have lots of\n\n2:38:52.900 --> 2:38:54.660\n sort of hands on public policy\n\n2:38:54.660 --> 2:38:57.780\n about concerns around patient rights and things like that.\n\n2:38:57.780 --> 2:39:00.060\n But if we can't figure out\n\n2:39:00.060 --> 2:39:02.580\n how to have a public policy conversation\n\n2:39:02.580 --> 2:39:06.980\n around how technology is gonna reform our public roadways\n\n2:39:06.980 --> 2:39:08.740\n and our transportation system,\n\n2:39:10.300 --> 2:39:13.940\n we're really leaving way too much to private companies.\n\n2:39:13.940 --> 2:39:17.380\n And it's just, it's not in there.\n\n2:39:17.380 --> 2:39:19.540\n I get asked this question, like, what should companies do?\n\n2:39:19.540 --> 2:39:22.340\n And I'm like, just go about doing what you're doing.\n\n2:39:22.340 --> 2:39:24.420\n I mean, please come to the table and talk about it,\n\n2:39:24.420 --> 2:39:26.420\n but it's not their role.\n\n2:39:26.420 --> 2:39:29.940\n I mean, I appreciate Ilan's attempts\n\n2:39:29.940 --> 2:39:34.700\n to have species level goals,\n\n2:39:34.700 --> 2:39:36.380\n like, we're gonna go to Mars.\n\n2:39:36.380 --> 2:39:37.660\n I mean, that's amazing.\n\n2:39:37.660 --> 2:39:42.660\n And that's incredible that someone can realize that,\n\n2:39:42.940 --> 2:39:44.620\n have a chance at realizing that vision.\n\n2:39:44.620 --> 2:39:46.020\n It's amazing.\n\n2:39:46.020 --> 2:39:50.180\n But when it comes to so many areas of our economy,\n\n2:39:50.180 --> 2:39:52.540\n we can't wait for a hero.\n\n2:39:52.540 --> 2:39:53.860\n We have to have,\n\n2:39:53.860 --> 2:39:56.500\n and there are way too many interests involved.\n\n2:39:56.500 --> 2:39:58.420\n It's who builds the roads.\n\n2:39:58.420 --> 2:40:02.100\n I mean, the money that sloshes around on Capitol Hill\n\n2:40:02.100 --> 2:40:05.420\n to decide what happens in these infrastructure bills\n\n2:40:05.420 --> 2:40:09.060\n and the transportation bill is just obscene, right?\n\n2:40:09.060 --> 2:40:12.100\n See, I think it's an interesting view of markets.\n\n2:40:12.940 --> 2:40:16.980\n Correct me if I'm wrong, let me propose a theory to you.\n\n2:40:16.980 --> 2:40:21.980\n That progress in the world is made by heroes\n\n2:40:22.020 --> 2:40:24.020\n and the markets remove the inefficiencies\n\n2:40:24.020 --> 2:40:26.180\n from the work the heroes did.\n\n2:40:26.180 --> 2:40:30.420\n So going to Mars from the perspective of markets\n\n2:40:30.420 --> 2:40:32.220\n probably has no value.\n\n2:40:32.220 --> 2:40:34.060\n Maybe you can argue it's good for hiring\n\n2:40:34.060 --> 2:40:35.860\n to have a vision or something like that,\n\n2:40:35.860 --> 2:40:37.940\n but like those big projects\n\n2:40:37.940 --> 2:40:40.500\n don't seem to have an obvious value,\n\n2:40:40.500 --> 2:40:45.500\n but our world progresses by those big leaps.\n\n2:40:45.500 --> 2:40:48.660\n And then after the leaps are taken,\n\n2:40:48.660 --> 2:40:50.500\n then the markets are very good\n\n2:40:50.500 --> 2:40:52.980\n at removing sort of inefficiencies.\n\n2:40:52.980 --> 2:40:55.940\n But it just feels like the autonomous vehicle space\n\n2:40:55.940 --> 2:40:59.300\n and the autonomous trucking space requires leaps.\n\n2:40:59.300 --> 2:41:03.860\n It doesn't feel like we can sneak up into a good solution\n\n2:41:03.860 --> 2:41:05.700\n that is ultimately good for labor,\n\n2:41:05.700 --> 2:41:07.980\n like for human beings in the system.\n\n2:41:07.980 --> 2:41:12.980\n It feels like some, like probably a bad example,\n\n2:41:12.980 --> 2:41:15.660\n but like a Henry Ford type of character steps in\n\n2:41:15.660 --> 2:41:18.460\n and say like, we need to do stuff completely differently.\n\n2:41:20.260 --> 2:41:24.140\n Yeah, and you said we can't hope for a hero,\n\n2:41:24.140 --> 2:41:27.780\n but it's like, no, but we can say we need a hero.\n\n2:41:27.780 --> 2:41:29.260\n We need more heroes.\n\n2:41:29.260 --> 2:41:31.740\n So if you're a young kid right now listening to this,\n\n2:41:31.740 --> 2:41:33.220\n we need you to be a hero.\n\n2:41:33.220 --> 2:41:34.980\n It's not like we need you to start a company\n\n2:41:34.980 --> 2:41:36.700\n that makes a lot of money, no.\n\n2:41:36.700 --> 2:41:38.900\n You need to start a company that makes a lot of money\n\n2:41:38.900 --> 2:41:41.420\n so that you can feed your family\n\n2:41:41.420 --> 2:41:43.300\n as you become a hero and take huge risks\n\n2:41:43.300 --> 2:41:45.220\n and potentially go bankrupt.\n\n2:41:45.220 --> 2:41:49.180\n Those risks is how we move society forward, I think.\n\n2:41:49.180 --> 2:41:51.340\n Maybe that's a romantic view, I don't know.\n\n2:41:51.340 --> 2:41:52.420\n I totally disagree.\n\n2:41:52.420 --> 2:41:53.940\n You disagree, goddammit.\n\n2:41:53.940 --> 2:41:54.780\n I mean, I...\n\n2:41:54.780 --> 2:41:57.620\n And out of the two of us, you're the knowledgeable one.\n\n2:41:57.620 --> 2:41:58.860\n No, no.\n\n2:41:58.860 --> 2:42:01.940\n No, no, I think it's a matter of like,\n\n2:42:01.940 --> 2:42:02.940\n do we need those heroes?\n\n2:42:02.940 --> 2:42:04.060\n Absolutely.\n\n2:42:04.060 --> 2:42:09.060\n I mean, I saw the boosters come down from space,\n\n2:42:09.060 --> 2:42:12.900\n boosters come down from SpaceX's rockets\n\n2:42:12.900 --> 2:42:18.020\n and land nearly simultaneously with my kids\n\n2:42:18.020 --> 2:42:19.820\n after school one day.\n\n2:42:19.820 --> 2:42:21.700\n And I thought, oh my god,\n\n2:42:21.700 --> 2:42:25.580\n like science fiction has been made real.\n\n2:42:25.580 --> 2:42:26.620\n It's incredible.\n\n2:42:26.620 --> 2:42:29.740\n And it's a pinnacle of human achievement, right?\n\n2:42:29.740 --> 2:42:32.620\n It's like, this is what we're capable of.\n\n2:42:32.620 --> 2:42:37.140\n But we need to have those heroes oriented.\n\n2:42:37.140 --> 2:42:42.140\n We need to allow them to orient toward the goals, right?\n\n2:42:42.940 --> 2:42:43.780\n We gotta...\n\n2:42:43.780 --> 2:42:45.700\n Climate change, you know?\n\n2:42:45.700 --> 2:42:48.860\n I mean, all the heroes out there, right?\n\n2:42:48.860 --> 2:42:50.940\n I mean, it's time.\n\n2:42:50.940 --> 2:42:52.140\n The clock is ticking.\n\n2:42:52.140 --> 2:42:53.900\n It's past time.\n\n2:42:53.900 --> 2:42:55.780\n I've been working on climate change issues\n\n2:42:55.780 --> 2:42:58.100\n since the mid 90s.\n\n2:42:59.500 --> 2:43:04.300\n I still remember the first time in 2010\n\n2:43:04.300 --> 2:43:08.580\n when I got a grant that was completely focused\n\n2:43:08.580 --> 2:43:11.060\n on adaptation rather than prevention.\n\n2:43:12.060 --> 2:43:17.060\n And just when it hit me, that like, wow.\n\n2:43:18.580 --> 2:43:22.180\n So adaptation versus prevention is like acceptance\n\n2:43:22.180 --> 2:43:25.420\n that there's going to be catastrophic impact.\n\n2:43:25.420 --> 2:43:28.660\n We need to figure out how do we at least live with that.\n\n2:43:28.660 --> 2:43:29.500\n Yeah.\n\n2:43:29.500 --> 2:43:30.340\n And you know, the grant was like,\n\n2:43:30.340 --> 2:43:32.700\n okay, our agriculture system is gonna move,\n\n2:43:32.700 --> 2:43:34.900\n our breadbasket is no longer gonna be California,\n\n2:43:34.900 --> 2:43:36.460\n it's gonna be Illinois.\n\n2:43:36.460 --> 2:43:38.580\n What does that mean for truck transportation?\n\n2:43:38.580 --> 2:43:42.060\n So it's like, so in terms of a big philosophical\n\n2:43:42.060 --> 2:43:44.660\n societal level, that's kind of like giving up.\n\n2:43:44.660 --> 2:43:45.500\n Yeah.\n\n2:43:45.500 --> 2:43:47.020\n In terms of the big heroic actions.\n\n2:43:47.020 --> 2:43:47.860\n Yeah.\n\n2:43:47.860 --> 2:43:51.300\n You know, failures in human history, yeah.\n\n2:43:51.300 --> 2:43:56.180\n That's gonna be, let's hope not the biggest, but could be.\n\n2:43:56.180 --> 2:43:57.020\n Do you...\n\n2:43:57.020 --> 2:43:59.540\n So let me say why I disagree, right?\n\n2:43:59.540 --> 2:44:02.500\n Henry Ford, amazing, right?\n\n2:44:02.500 --> 2:44:04.500\n To sort of mass produce cars, right?\n\n2:44:04.500 --> 2:44:07.500\n Daimler to put that first truck on the road\n\n2:44:07.500 --> 2:44:09.220\n without the roads, right?\n\n2:44:09.220 --> 2:44:11.460\n So there's like, we need that innovation.\n\n2:44:11.460 --> 2:44:12.500\n There's no doubt about it.\n\n2:44:12.500 --> 2:44:14.220\n And there are rules for that,\n\n2:44:14.220 --> 2:44:19.220\n but there's big public stuff that sets the stage.\n\n2:44:19.540 --> 2:44:20.380\n It's critical.\n\n2:44:20.380 --> 2:44:22.420\n And you know, and what it really is,\n\n2:44:22.420 --> 2:44:25.060\n it's a sociological problem, right?\n\n2:44:25.060 --> 2:44:26.020\n It's a political problem.\n\n2:44:26.020 --> 2:44:26.860\n It's a social problem.\n\n2:44:26.860 --> 2:44:29.900\n We have to say, and we have these screwed up ideas, right?\n\n2:44:29.900 --> 2:44:31.900\n So we have this politics right now\n\n2:44:31.900 --> 2:44:34.340\n where like everybody feels like they're getting screwed\n\n2:44:34.340 --> 2:44:37.980\n and someone undeserving is benefiting.\n\n2:44:37.980 --> 2:44:40.260\n When in fact, like, you know, at least in the middle, right?\n\n2:44:40.260 --> 2:44:41.100\n They're huge.\n\n2:44:41.100 --> 2:44:43.500\n I used to teach this course in rich and poor,\n\n2:44:43.500 --> 2:44:45.140\n you know, in economic inequality.\n\n2:44:45.140 --> 2:44:49.100\n And I would go through public housing subsidies\n\n2:44:49.100 --> 2:44:53.260\n in Philadelphia, you know, section eight subsidies,\n\n2:44:53.260 --> 2:44:57.140\n you know, and then I would go through my housing subsidies\n\n2:44:57.140 --> 2:45:00.300\n for my mortgage interest deduction.\n\n2:45:00.300 --> 2:45:02.900\n And it worked out to basically the average payment\n\n2:45:02.900 --> 2:45:06.780\n for a section eight housing voucher in my neighborhood.\n\n2:45:06.780 --> 2:45:08.060\n I'm not a welfare recipient\n\n2:45:08.060 --> 2:45:10.220\n according to the dominant discourse.\n\n2:45:10.220 --> 2:45:13.180\n And so we have this completely screwed up sense\n\n2:45:13.180 --> 2:45:15.540\n of like where our dollars go and you know,\n\n2:45:15.540 --> 2:45:17.620\n who benefits from the investment.\n\n2:45:17.620 --> 2:45:20.980\n And you know, we need to, you know,\n\n2:45:20.980 --> 2:45:21.900\n I don't know that we can do it,\n\n2:45:21.900 --> 2:45:24.700\n but you know, if we're gonna survive,\n\n2:45:24.700 --> 2:45:28.900\n we need to figure out how to have honest conversations\n\n2:45:28.900 --> 2:45:32.660\n where private interest is where we need it to be\n\n2:45:32.660 --> 2:45:35.380\n in fostering innovation and, you know,\n\n2:45:35.380 --> 2:45:37.620\n and rewarding the people who do incredible things.\n\n2:45:37.620 --> 2:45:41.100\n Please, you know, we don't wanna squash that,\n\n2:45:41.100 --> 2:45:42.820\n but we need to harness that power\n\n2:45:42.820 --> 2:45:45.340\n to solve what I think are some pretty big,\n\n2:45:45.340 --> 2:45:47.500\n you know, existential problems.\n\n2:45:47.500 --> 2:45:50.660\n So you think there's a like government level,\n\n2:45:50.660 --> 2:45:53.180\n national level collaboration required\n\n2:45:53.180 --> 2:45:54.460\n for infrastructure project.\n\n2:45:54.460 --> 2:45:59.460\n Like there's, we should really have large moonshot projects\n\n2:46:01.300 --> 2:46:04.860\n that are funded by our governments.\n\n2:46:04.860 --> 2:46:06.420\n At least guided by, I mean,\n\n2:46:06.420 --> 2:46:08.140\n I think there are ways to finance them\n\n2:46:08.140 --> 2:46:08.980\n and you know, other things,\n\n2:46:08.980 --> 2:46:10.860\n but we gotta be careful, right?\n\n2:46:10.860 --> 2:46:13.140\n Cause that's where you get all these sort of perverse,\n\n2:46:13.140 --> 2:46:15.220\n you know, unintended consequences and whatnot.\n\n2:46:15.220 --> 2:46:18.380\n But if you look at transportation in the United States\n\n2:46:18.380 --> 2:46:21.900\n and it is the foundation of the, you know,\n\n2:46:21.900 --> 2:46:24.900\n manifest destiny, economic growth, right?\n\n2:46:24.900 --> 2:46:29.020\n That built the United States into the world superpower\n\n2:46:29.020 --> 2:46:30.980\n that it became and the industrial power that it became.\n\n2:46:30.980 --> 2:46:33.540\n It rested on transportation, right?\n\n2:46:33.540 --> 2:46:35.580\n It was like, you know, the Erie Canal,\n\n2:46:35.580 --> 2:46:38.380\n I grew up a few miles from where they dug\n\n2:46:38.380 --> 2:46:40.540\n the first shovel full of the Erie Canal\n\n2:46:40.540 --> 2:46:44.060\n and everyone thought it was, you know, crazy, right?\n\n2:46:44.060 --> 2:46:46.660\n But those public infrastructure projects,\n\n2:46:46.660 --> 2:46:49.020\n the canals, right, the railroads, yeah,\n\n2:46:49.020 --> 2:46:50.100\n they were privately built,\n\n2:46:50.100 --> 2:46:52.500\n but they wouldn't have been privately built without,\n\n2:46:52.500 --> 2:46:55.020\n you know, Lincoln funding them essentially\n\n2:46:55.020 --> 2:46:59.060\n and giving, you know, the railroads, you know, land\n\n2:46:59.060 --> 2:47:01.140\n in exchange for building them.\n\n2:47:01.140 --> 2:47:03.500\n The highway system, the Eisenhower,\n\n2:47:03.500 --> 2:47:06.740\n the payback that the US economy got\n\n2:47:06.740 --> 2:47:09.700\n from the Dwight D. Eisenhower interstate system\n\n2:47:09.700 --> 2:47:12.140\n is phenomenal, right?\n\n2:47:12.140 --> 2:47:14.020\n No private entity was gonna do that.\n\n2:47:14.020 --> 2:47:17.060\n Electrification, dams, water, you know,\n\n2:47:17.060 --> 2:47:21.580\n we need to do these infrastructure, infrastructure.\n\n2:47:21.580 --> 2:47:24.340\n And now more than ever, it's been really upsetting to me\n\n2:47:24.340 --> 2:47:25.820\n on the COVID front.\n\n2:47:27.220 --> 2:47:29.660\n There's one of the solutions to COVID,\n\n2:47:29.660 --> 2:47:32.500\n which seems obvious to me from the very beginning\n\n2:47:32.500 --> 2:47:34.940\n that nobody's opposed to.\n\n2:47:34.940 --> 2:47:39.820\n It's one of the only bipartisan things is at home testing,\n\n2:47:39.820 --> 2:47:41.540\n rapid at home testing.\n\n2:47:41.540 --> 2:47:45.260\n There's no reason why at the government level,\n\n2:47:45.260 --> 2:47:47.860\n we couldn't manufacture hundreds of millions of tests\n\n2:47:47.860 --> 2:47:48.820\n a month.\n\n2:47:48.820 --> 2:47:51.300\n There's no reason starting in May, 2020.\n\n2:47:51.300 --> 2:47:55.220\n And that gives power to a country that values freedom,\n\n2:47:55.220 --> 2:47:57.140\n that gives power information to each individual\n\n2:47:57.140 --> 2:47:59.260\n to know whether they have COVID or not.\n\n2:47:59.260 --> 2:48:04.260\n So it's possible to manufacture them for under a dollar.\n\n2:48:04.260 --> 2:48:05.820\n It's like an obvious thing.\n\n2:48:05.820 --> 2:48:07.140\n It's kind of like the roads.\n\n2:48:07.140 --> 2:48:08.980\n It's like, everybody's invested.\n\n2:48:08.980 --> 2:48:11.580\n Let's put countless tests in the hands\n\n2:48:11.580 --> 2:48:13.500\n of every single American citizen,\n\n2:48:13.500 --> 2:48:16.580\n maybe every citizen of the world.\n\n2:48:16.580 --> 2:48:19.500\n The fact that we haven't done that today\n\n2:48:19.500 --> 2:48:21.860\n and there's some regulation stuff with the FDA,\n\n2:48:21.860 --> 2:48:24.380\n all the kind of dragging of feet,\n\n2:48:24.380 --> 2:48:26.060\n but there's not actually a good explanation\n\n2:48:26.060 --> 2:48:31.060\n except our leaders and culturally,\n\n2:48:31.460 --> 2:48:35.940\n we've lost the sort of, not lost,\n\n2:48:35.940 --> 2:48:38.020\n but it's a little bit dormant.\n\n2:48:38.020 --> 2:48:42.100\n The will to do these big projects that better the world.\n\n2:48:43.140 --> 2:48:45.980\n I still have the hope that when faced\n\n2:48:45.980 --> 2:48:50.980\n with catastrophic events, the more dramatic,\n\n2:48:51.980 --> 2:48:53.860\n the more damaging, the more painful they are,\n\n2:48:53.860 --> 2:48:56.700\n the higher we will rise to meet those.\n\n2:48:56.700 --> 2:48:58.900\n And that's where the infrastructure style projects\n\n2:48:58.900 --> 2:48:59.740\n are really important.\n\n2:48:59.740 --> 2:49:03.860\n But it's certainly a little bit challenging\n\n2:49:03.860 --> 2:49:06.620\n to remain an optimist in the times of COVID\n\n2:49:06.620 --> 2:49:10.420\n because the response of our leaders has not been as great\n\n2:49:10.420 --> 2:49:14.300\n and as historic as I would have hoped.\n\n2:49:14.300 --> 2:49:17.420\n I would hope that the actions of leaders\n\n2:49:17.420 --> 2:49:19.740\n in the past few years in response to COVID\n\n2:49:20.700 --> 2:49:23.180\n would be ones that are written in the history books.\n\n2:49:23.180 --> 2:49:25.820\n And we talk about it as we talk about FDR,\n\n2:49:25.820 --> 2:49:27.580\n but sadly, I don't know.\n\n2:49:27.580 --> 2:49:29.380\n I think the history books will forget\n\n2:49:30.780 --> 2:49:32.300\n the actions of our leaders.\n\n2:49:32.300 --> 2:49:37.300\n So let me just, to wrap up autonomy,\n\n2:49:42.020 --> 2:49:43.900\n when you look into the future,\n\n2:49:45.780 --> 2:49:50.780\n are you excited about automation in the space of trucking?\n\n2:49:52.020 --> 2:49:55.540\n Is it, when you go to bed at night,\n\n2:49:57.580 --> 2:50:01.740\n do you see a beautiful world in your vision\n\n2:50:01.740 --> 2:50:03.220\n that involves autonomous trucks?\n\n2:50:03.220 --> 2:50:07.020\n Like all of the truckers you've become close with,\n\n2:50:07.020 --> 2:50:10.340\n you've talked to, do you see a better world for them\n\n2:50:10.340 --> 2:50:11.780\n because of autonomous trucks?\n\n2:50:13.140 --> 2:50:14.100\n Damn you, Alex.\n\n2:50:15.140 --> 2:50:15.980\n You know why?\n\n2:50:15.980 --> 2:50:19.140\n Because I mean, I want to be an optimist,\n\n2:50:19.140 --> 2:50:21.380\n and I want to think of myself, I guess,\n\n2:50:21.380 --> 2:50:23.780\n as a half glass bowl kind of person.\n\n2:50:23.780 --> 2:50:25.580\n But when you ask it like that,\n\n2:50:25.580 --> 2:50:27.820\n and I think about like,\n\n2:50:27.820 --> 2:50:32.820\n when I look at the challenges to harnessing that for,\n\n2:50:36.820 --> 2:50:40.660\n just let's take just labor and climate, right?\n\n2:50:40.660 --> 2:50:41.580\n There are other issues,\n\n2:50:41.580 --> 2:50:43.420\n congestion, et cetera, infrastructure,\n\n2:50:43.420 --> 2:50:45.500\n that are gonna be affected by this,\n\n2:50:45.500 --> 2:50:48.660\n again, those big transformational issues.\n\n2:50:50.100 --> 2:50:53.300\n I think it's gonna take the best of us.\n\n2:50:53.300 --> 2:50:58.300\n Like it's gonna take the best of our policy approaches.\n\n2:50:59.660 --> 2:51:03.660\n We need to start investing in building those,\n\n2:51:03.660 --> 2:51:05.180\n rebuilding those institutions.\n\n2:51:05.180 --> 2:51:07.700\n I mean, that's what we've seen in the last four years, right?\n\n2:51:07.700 --> 2:51:11.420\n And the erosion of that was so clear\n\n2:51:11.420 --> 2:51:12.460\n among these truck drivers.\n\n2:51:12.460 --> 2:51:16.260\n Like when Trump came in and said like,\n\n2:51:17.420 --> 2:51:20.060\n free trades, good for workers, like, yeah, right.\n\n2:51:20.060 --> 2:51:23.420\n I grew up in the Rust Belt.\n\n2:51:23.420 --> 2:51:25.540\n I watched factory after factory close.\n\n2:51:25.540 --> 2:51:28.300\n All of my ancestors worked at the same factory.\n\n2:51:28.300 --> 2:51:30.020\n It's still holding on by a thread.\n\n2:51:30.020 --> 2:51:35.020\n Like, the Democratic Party told blue collar workers\n\n2:51:35.780 --> 2:51:38.300\n for years, I don't worry about free trade.\n\n2:51:38.300 --> 2:51:39.460\n It's not bad for you.\n\n2:51:39.460 --> 2:51:40.860\n And I know the economists will probably\n\n2:51:40.860 --> 2:51:42.220\n get in the comment box now.\n\n2:51:44.020 --> 2:51:45.620\n We'll look forward to your comments.\n\n2:51:45.620 --> 2:51:46.580\n Look forward to your comments\n\n2:51:46.580 --> 2:51:48.580\n about how free trade benefits everybody.\n\n2:51:48.580 --> 2:51:53.580\n But, you know, immigration, you know, you go,\n\n2:51:54.020 --> 2:51:56.060\n and I think immigration is great.\n\n2:51:56.060 --> 2:51:59.820\n The United States benefits from it tremendously, right?\n\n2:51:59.820 --> 2:52:01.700\n But there are costs, right?\n\n2:52:01.700 --> 2:52:05.860\n Go down to South Philadelphia and find a drywaller\n\n2:52:05.860 --> 2:52:08.740\n and tell him that immigration hasn't hurt him, right?\n\n2:52:08.740 --> 2:52:12.500\n You know, go to these places where there's competition,\n\n2:52:12.500 --> 2:52:13.340\n right?\n\n2:52:13.340 --> 2:52:15.540\n And yes, we benefit overall,\n\n2:52:15.540 --> 2:52:19.300\n but we have a system that allows some people\n\n2:52:19.300 --> 2:52:21.980\n to pay really high costs.\n\n2:52:21.980 --> 2:52:24.180\n And Trump tapped into that, you know?\n\n2:52:24.180 --> 2:52:26.540\n And there was no, you know,\n\n2:52:26.540 --> 2:52:28.540\n there's more than that too, obviously.\n\n2:52:28.540 --> 2:52:30.900\n And there's lots of really dark stuff\n\n2:52:30.900 --> 2:52:32.820\n that goes along with it, you know,\n\n2:52:32.820 --> 2:52:35.540\n the sort of racialization of others and things like that.\n\n2:52:35.540 --> 2:52:40.220\n But he hit on those core, you know, issues that, you know,\n\n2:52:40.220 --> 2:52:42.380\n if you were to go back over my trucking interviews\n\n2:52:42.380 --> 2:52:44.740\n for 15 years, you would have heard those stories\n\n2:52:44.740 --> 2:52:47.660\n over and over and over again, that sense of voicelessness,\n\n2:52:47.660 --> 2:52:49.020\n that sense of powerlessness,\n\n2:52:49.020 --> 2:52:50.780\n that sense that there's no difference\n\n2:52:50.780 --> 2:52:52.300\n between the Democrats and the Republicans\n\n2:52:52.300 --> 2:52:54.780\n because they're all gonna screw us over.\n\n2:52:54.780 --> 2:52:56.380\n And that was there, you know?\n\n2:52:56.380 --> 2:52:58.220\n And you just ignore it as long as you want\n\n2:52:58.220 --> 2:53:00.220\n and tell people, don't worry, trade's good for you.\n\n2:53:00.220 --> 2:53:01.860\n Don't worry, immigration's good for you.\n\n2:53:01.860 --> 2:53:04.060\n As their communities lose factories.\n\n2:53:04.060 --> 2:53:05.900\n And I mean, a lot of them were lost to the South\n\n2:53:05.900 --> 2:53:07.940\n before they were lost to overseas, whatever,\n\n2:53:07.940 --> 2:53:10.660\n but tapped into that, you know?\n\n2:53:10.660 --> 2:53:13.580\n And there's a fundamental distrust of,\n\n2:53:13.580 --> 2:53:16.300\n you know, you look at these like pupils on like,\n\n2:53:16.300 --> 2:53:17.740\n you know, whether people trust the media, right?\n\n2:53:17.740 --> 2:53:21.180\n But whether or not they trust higher education, you know,\n\n2:53:21.180 --> 2:53:24.180\n these institutions that I find magical, right?\n\n2:53:24.180 --> 2:53:27.940\n I mean, you look at the vaccine research and stuff,\n\n2:53:27.940 --> 2:53:30.820\n that, you know, just, you know, brilliant, you know,\n\n2:53:30.820 --> 2:53:33.740\n people doing incredible things for humanity.\n\n2:53:33.740 --> 2:53:36.260\n Like, you know, the idea that like, you know,\n\n2:53:36.260 --> 2:53:39.420\n we can take these viruses that, you know,\n\n2:53:39.420 --> 2:53:42.100\n used to ravage through the human population\n\n2:53:42.100 --> 2:53:44.180\n that we had to be terrified of.\n\n2:53:44.180 --> 2:53:47.660\n And, you know, we've suffered, but, you know,\n\n2:53:47.660 --> 2:53:52.500\n we have such power now to defend ourselves, right?\n\n2:53:52.500 --> 2:53:54.580\n Behind these programs, right?\n\n2:53:54.580 --> 2:53:56.740\n And to see those, people would be like,\n\n2:53:56.740 --> 2:53:58.300\n eh, I'm not sure if higher education's good\n\n2:53:58.300 --> 2:54:00.980\n for the country or not, you know, it's like,\n\n2:54:00.980 --> 2:54:02.140\n where are we, you know?\n\n2:54:02.140 --> 2:54:04.140\n So we need to rebuild the faith and trust\n\n2:54:04.140 --> 2:54:05.580\n in those institutions and have these,\n\n2:54:05.580 --> 2:54:07.340\n but we need to have honest conversations\n\n2:54:07.340 --> 2:54:09.900\n before people are gonna buy it, you know?\n\n2:54:09.900 --> 2:54:11.980\n Do you have ideas for rebuilding the trust\n\n2:54:11.980 --> 2:54:13.460\n and giving a voice to the voices?\n\n2:54:13.460 --> 2:54:18.060\n So is the, many of the things we've been talking about\n\n2:54:18.060 --> 2:54:21.460\n is so sort of deeply integrated.\n\n2:54:21.460 --> 2:54:24.380\n You think like, this is the trouble I have\n\n2:54:24.380 --> 2:54:27.020\n with people that work on AI and autonomous vehicles\n\n2:54:27.020 --> 2:54:30.980\n and so on, it's not just a technology problem.\n\n2:54:30.980 --> 2:54:35.980\n It's this human pain problem.\n\n2:54:36.100 --> 2:54:39.780\n It's the robot essentially silencing the voice\n\n2:54:39.780 --> 2:54:43.100\n of a human being because it's lowering their wage,\n\n2:54:43.100 --> 2:54:46.020\n making them suffer more and giving them no tools\n\n2:54:46.020 --> 2:54:48.820\n of how to escape that suffering.\n\n2:54:48.820 --> 2:54:53.460\n Is there something, I mean, it even gets\n\n2:54:53.460 --> 2:54:55.540\n into the question of meaning, you know?\n\n2:54:55.540 --> 2:54:59.800\n So if money is one thing, but it's also\n\n2:54:59.800 --> 2:55:01.260\n what makes us happy in life.\n\n2:55:01.260 --> 2:55:06.260\n You know, a lot of those truckers,\n\n2:55:06.340 --> 2:55:08.300\n the set of jobs they've had in their life\n\n2:55:08.300 --> 2:55:10.900\n were defining to them as human beings.\n\n2:55:12.460 --> 2:55:14.740\n And so, and the question with automation\n\n2:55:14.740 --> 2:55:19.740\n is not just how do we have a job that gives you money\n\n2:55:21.020 --> 2:55:24.740\n to feed your family, but also a job that gives you meaning,\n\n2:55:24.740 --> 2:55:26.020\n that gives you pride.\n\n2:55:26.020 --> 2:55:26.860\n Yeah.\n\n2:55:27.780 --> 2:55:32.780\n And for me, the hope is that AI and automation\n\n2:55:32.780 --> 2:55:37.780\n will provide other jobs that will be a source of meaning.\n\n2:55:43.980 --> 2:55:47.020\n But coupled with that hope is that there will not\n\n2:55:47.020 --> 2:55:49.380\n be too much suffering in the transition.\n\n2:55:49.380 --> 2:55:53.500\n And that's not obvious from the people you've spoken with.\n\n2:55:53.500 --> 2:55:55.580\n I mean, I think we need to differentiate\n\n2:55:55.580 --> 2:55:57.020\n between the effects of technology\n\n2:55:57.020 --> 2:55:58.560\n and the effects of capitalism, right?\n\n2:55:58.560 --> 2:56:02.740\n And they are, you know, the fact that workers\n\n2:56:02.740 --> 2:56:06.740\n don't have a lot of power, right, in the system matters.\n\n2:56:06.740 --> 2:56:08.140\n Now, we had a system, right?\n\n2:56:08.140 --> 2:56:09.380\n And that's why I would say, you know,\n\n2:56:09.380 --> 2:56:12.940\n go to that, you know, Harry Bridges report.\n\n2:56:12.940 --> 2:56:16.740\n And, you know, those were workers who had a sense of power.\n\n2:56:16.740 --> 2:56:18.560\n They said, you know what, we can demand\n\n2:56:18.560 --> 2:56:21.180\n some of the benefits, like, yeah, automate our jobs away,\n\n2:56:21.180 --> 2:56:24.300\n but, you know, kick a little down to us, right?\n\n2:56:24.300 --> 2:56:28.860\n And we had, in the golden era of American industrialism\n\n2:56:28.860 --> 2:56:32.340\n in post World War II, that was the contract.\n\n2:56:32.340 --> 2:56:35.200\n The contract was employers can do what they want\n\n2:56:35.200 --> 2:56:37.020\n in automation and all these things.\n\n2:56:37.020 --> 2:56:38.440\n Yeah, sure, there's some union rules\n\n2:56:38.440 --> 2:56:40.980\n that make things less efficient in places,\n\n2:56:40.980 --> 2:56:45.460\n but the key compromise is tie wages to productivity.\n\n2:56:45.460 --> 2:56:46.300\n That's what we did.\n\n2:56:46.300 --> 2:56:47.780\n We tied, that's what unions did.\n\n2:56:47.780 --> 2:56:50.700\n They tied wages to productivity, kept demand up, right?\n\n2:56:50.700 --> 2:56:54.220\n It was good for the economy, some economists think, right?\n\n2:56:54.220 --> 2:56:57.540\n And that's what, you know, we need to,\n\n2:56:57.540 --> 2:56:59.820\n I think we need to acknowledge that.\n\n2:56:59.820 --> 2:57:02.740\n We need to acknowledge the fact\n\n2:57:02.740 --> 2:57:04.560\n that it's not just technology,\n\n2:57:04.560 --> 2:57:08.900\n it's technology in a social context\n\n2:57:08.900 --> 2:57:10.540\n in which some people have a lot of power\n\n2:57:10.540 --> 2:57:12.620\n to determine what happens.\n\n2:57:12.620 --> 2:57:14.420\n For me, I don't have all the answers,\n\n2:57:14.420 --> 2:57:15.940\n but I know what my answer is.\n\n2:57:15.940 --> 2:57:19.220\n And my answer is, and I think I started with this, you know,\n\n2:57:19.220 --> 2:57:24.220\n I can learn from every single person, you know?\n\n2:57:24.280 --> 2:57:26.580\n Did I have to talk to the 200th truck driver?\n\n2:57:27.560 --> 2:57:31.680\n In my opinion, yes, because I was gonna learn something\n\n2:57:31.680 --> 2:57:33.920\n from that 200th truck driver.\n\n2:57:33.920 --> 2:57:38.920\n Now, people with more power might talk to none,\n\n2:57:39.680 --> 2:57:41.720\n or they might talk to five and say, okay, I got it.\n\n2:57:41.720 --> 2:57:46.720\n You know, people are amazing\n\n2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:49.100\n and every one of them has a life experience\n\n2:57:49.100 --> 2:57:53.920\n and concerns and, you know, can teach us something.\n\n2:57:53.920 --> 2:57:57.180\n And they're not in the conversation, you know?\n\n2:57:57.180 --> 2:58:00.720\n And I know this because I'm the expert, you know?\n\n2:58:00.720 --> 2:58:02.720\n So I get pulled in to these conversations\n\n2:58:02.720 --> 2:58:04.260\n and people wanna know, you know,\n\n2:58:04.260 --> 2:58:06.040\n what's gonna happen to labor, you know?\n\n2:58:06.040 --> 2:58:10.200\n It's like, well, so I try to be a sounding board\n\n2:58:10.200 --> 2:58:14.000\n and I feel a tremendous weight of responsibility,\n\n2:58:14.960 --> 2:58:16.240\n you know, for that.\n\n2:58:16.240 --> 2:58:21.240\n So, but I'm not those workers, you know?\n\n2:58:21.640 --> 2:58:24.920\n And they may listen to this or, you know,\n\n2:58:24.920 --> 2:58:27.120\n walk in the door sometime, it's about to be like,\n\n2:58:27.120 --> 2:58:29.600\n that guy's full of shit, that's not what I think at all.\n\n2:58:29.600 --> 2:58:30.440\n You know?\n\n2:58:31.440 --> 2:58:34.680\n And they don't get heard over and over and over.\n\n2:58:34.680 --> 2:58:36.920\n But in a small way, you are providing a voice to them\n\n2:58:36.920 --> 2:58:40.600\n and that's kind of the, if at scale,\n\n2:58:40.600 --> 2:58:43.980\n we apply that empathy and listening,\n\n2:58:43.980 --> 2:58:46.120\n that we could provide the voice to the voiceless\n\n2:58:46.120 --> 2:58:47.980\n through our votes, through our money, through,\n\n2:58:47.980 --> 2:58:50.920\n I mean, that's one way to make capitalism work\n\n2:58:50.920 --> 2:58:55.920\n at not making the powerless more powerless,\n\n2:58:56.000 --> 2:58:58.440\n is by all of us being a community\n\n2:58:58.440 --> 2:58:59.880\n that listens to the pain of others\n\n2:58:59.880 --> 2:59:01.160\n and tries to minimize that,\n\n2:59:01.160 --> 2:59:03.320\n to try to give a voice to the voiceless,\n\n2:59:03.320 --> 2:59:05.480\n to give power to the powerless.\n\n2:59:05.480 --> 2:59:08.520\n I have to ask you on, by way of advice,\n\n2:59:09.640 --> 2:59:12.080\n young people, high school students, college students,\n\n2:59:12.080 --> 2:59:15.080\n entering this world full of automation,\n\n2:59:17.400 --> 2:59:22.400\n full of these complex labor markets and markets period,\n\n2:59:23.540 --> 2:59:25.600\n what would you, what kind of advice would you give\n\n2:59:25.600 --> 2:59:28.960\n to that person about how to have a career?\n\n2:59:28.960 --> 2:59:31.280\n How to have a life they can be proud of?\n\n2:59:32.520 --> 2:59:35.280\n Yeah, I think, you know, this is such a great question.\n\n2:59:35.280 --> 2:59:42.280\n I don't, it's okay to quote Steve Jobs, right?\n\n2:59:42.280 --> 2:59:45.600\n Always.\n\n2:59:45.600 --> 2:59:49.520\n Yeah, I mean, so, and I just heard this recently.\n\n2:59:49.520 --> 2:59:51.600\n It was a commencement speech that he gave\n\n2:59:51.600 --> 2:59:53.080\n and I can't remember where it was.\n\n2:59:53.080 --> 2:59:55.240\n And he was talking about, you know,\n\n2:59:55.240 --> 2:59:56.660\n he had famously dropped out of school,\n\n2:59:56.660 --> 2:59:58.980\n but continued to take classes, right?\n\n2:59:59.840 --> 3:00:02.100\n And he took a calligraphy class\n\n3:00:02.100 --> 3:00:06.040\n that influenced the design of the Mac and sort of fonts.\n\n3:00:06.040 --> 3:00:09.520\n And, you know, just was something that he had no,\n\n3:00:09.520 --> 3:00:11.400\n you know, sense of what it was gonna be useful for.\n\n3:00:11.400 --> 3:00:13.600\n And his lesson was, you know,\n\n3:00:13.600 --> 3:00:16.760\n you can't connect the dots looking forward.\n\n3:00:16.760 --> 3:00:19.920\n You know, looking back, you can see all the pieces\n\n3:00:19.920 --> 3:00:22.500\n that sort of led you to where you ended up.\n\n3:00:22.500 --> 3:00:24.900\n And for me, studying truck driving,\n\n3:00:24.900 --> 3:00:27.120\n like, I mean, I literally went to graduate school\n\n3:00:27.120 --> 3:00:28.880\n because I was worried about climate change.\n\n3:00:28.880 --> 3:00:31.240\n And like, you know, I had a whole other dissertation plan\n\n3:00:31.240 --> 3:00:32.520\n and then was like driving home.\n\n3:00:32.520 --> 3:00:35.800\n And like, I had read about all this management literature\n\n3:00:35.800 --> 3:00:37.680\n and sort of like how you get workers to work hard\n\n3:00:37.680 --> 3:00:39.000\n for my qualifying exams.\n\n3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:41.000\n And then read a popular article\n\n3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:44.000\n on satellite linked computers.\n\n3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:45.880\n And the story in the literature was,\n\n3:00:45.880 --> 3:00:47.160\n you know, a sense of autonomy.\n\n3:00:47.160 --> 3:00:48.640\n And I was like, well,\n\n3:00:48.640 --> 3:00:51.300\n that monitoring must affect the sense of autonomy.\n\n3:00:51.300 --> 3:00:54.160\n And it's just this question that I found interesting.\n\n3:00:54.160 --> 3:00:55.480\n And it never in a million years\n\n3:00:55.480 --> 3:00:57.160\n that I ever thought I was gonna like study, you know,\n\n3:00:57.160 --> 3:01:01.580\n spend 15 years of my life studying truck driving.\n\n3:01:02.640 --> 3:01:07.080\n And it was like, if you were to map out a career path\n\n3:01:07.080 --> 3:01:10.440\n in academia or research, like, you know,\n\n3:01:10.440 --> 3:01:14.160\n you would do none of the things that I did\n\n3:01:14.160 --> 3:01:15.940\n that many people advise me against.\n\n3:01:15.940 --> 3:01:17.720\n Where like, you can't like go spend a year\n\n3:01:17.720 --> 3:01:20.880\n working as a truck driver, you know, like that's crazy.\n\n3:01:20.880 --> 3:01:23.000\n Or, you know, you can't, you know, spend all this time\n\n3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:26.160\n trying to write like one huge book and, you know.\n\n3:01:26.160 --> 3:01:28.120\n But by the way, if I could just interrupt,\n\n3:01:28.120 --> 3:01:32.600\n what was the fire that got you to take the leap\n\n3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:34.560\n and go and work as a truck driver\n\n3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:36.840\n and go interview truck drivers?\n\n3:01:36.840 --> 3:01:39.720\n This is what a lot of people would be incapable of doing,\n\n3:01:39.720 --> 3:01:41.320\n just took that leap.\n\n3:01:41.320 --> 3:01:43.800\n What the heck is up with your mind\n\n3:01:43.800 --> 3:01:46.080\n that allowed you to take that big leap?\n\n3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:50.080\n So I think it's probably like Tolkien.\n\n3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:51.320\n And Lord of the Rings, you know.\n\n3:01:51.320 --> 3:01:54.120\n I mean, I think as a teenager, you know,\n\n3:01:54.120 --> 3:01:58.400\n I sort of adopted some sense of needing to, you know,\n\n3:01:58.400 --> 3:02:01.960\n heroically go out in the world and, you know,\n\n3:02:01.960 --> 3:02:03.640\n which I've done at various points in my life\n\n3:02:03.640 --> 3:02:07.200\n and like looking back in absolutely stupid ways\n\n3:02:07.200 --> 3:02:08.880\n that, you know, where I could have completely,\n\n3:02:08.880 --> 3:02:11.200\n I ended up dead and traumatized my family,\n\n3:02:11.200 --> 3:02:14.720\n including like, I took a couple week trip in the Pacific,\n\n3:02:14.720 --> 3:02:16.280\n like a solo trip on a kayak.\n\n3:02:16.280 --> 3:02:19.280\n And basically my kayak experience up till that, you know,\n\n3:02:19.280 --> 3:02:21.480\n point had been, you know, on a fairly calm lake\n\n3:02:21.480 --> 3:02:22.320\n and like class one rapids on a river.\n\n3:02:22.320 --> 3:02:24.560\n Solo trip on a kayak in the Pacific.\n\n3:02:24.560 --> 3:02:25.400\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n3:02:25.400 --> 3:02:28.560\n So I was working on forestry issues\n\n3:02:28.560 --> 3:02:30.520\n and we were starting a campaign\n\n3:02:30.520 --> 3:02:33.080\n up in really remote British Columbia.\n\n3:02:33.080 --> 3:02:35.280\n And I was like, okay, if I'm gonna work on this,\n\n3:02:35.280 --> 3:02:36.720\n I've got to actually go there myself\n\n3:02:36.720 --> 3:02:38.120\n and see what this is all about\n\n3:02:38.120 --> 3:02:40.720\n and see whether it's worth like devoting my sort of,\n\n3:02:40.720 --> 3:02:42.480\n you know, life right now too.\n\n3:02:42.480 --> 3:02:45.240\n And just drove up there with this kayak\n\n3:02:45.240 --> 3:02:49.400\n and, you know, put into the Pacific and it was insane.\n\n3:02:49.400 --> 3:02:52.080\n You know, like the tides are huge\n\n3:02:52.080 --> 3:02:54.160\n and, you know, there was one point\n\n3:02:54.160 --> 3:02:56.400\n in which I was going down a fjord\n\n3:02:56.400 --> 3:03:00.480\n and two fjords kind of came up and there was a cross channel\n\n3:03:00.480 --> 3:03:03.360\n and I had hit the timing completely wrong\n\n3:03:03.360 --> 3:03:05.800\n and the tide was sort of rushing up like, you know,\n\n3:03:05.800 --> 3:03:08.600\n rivers in these, you know, two fjords\n\n3:03:08.600 --> 3:03:11.560\n and then coming through this cross channel and met\n\n3:03:11.560 --> 3:03:14.320\n and created this giant standing wave\n\n3:03:14.320 --> 3:03:16.320\n that I had to paddle through.\n\n3:03:16.320 --> 3:03:18.440\n And now actually very recently,\n\n3:03:18.440 --> 3:03:20.200\n I've gone out on whitewater with some people\n\n3:03:20.200 --> 3:03:21.760\n who know what the hell they're doing\n\n3:03:21.760 --> 3:03:26.240\n and I realized like just how absolutely stupid\n\n3:03:26.240 --> 3:03:28.320\n and, you know, ill fit I was,\n\n3:03:28.320 --> 3:03:31.120\n but that's just, I think I've always had that.\n\n3:03:31.120 --> 3:03:33.480\n Were you afraid when you had that wave before you?\n\n3:03:33.480 --> 3:03:35.120\n That wave scared the shit out of me, yeah.\n\n3:03:35.120 --> 3:03:39.080\n Okay, what about taking a leap and becoming a trucker?\n\n3:03:39.080 --> 3:03:41.040\n Yeah, there was some nervousness for sure.\n\n3:03:41.040 --> 3:03:44.080\n I mean, and, you know, I guess my advantage\n\n3:03:44.080 --> 3:03:48.920\n as an ethnographer is I grew up in a blue collar environment.\n\n3:03:48.920 --> 3:03:52.840\n You know, again, all my ancestors were factory workers.\n\n3:03:52.840 --> 3:03:56.600\n So I can move through spaces.\n\n3:03:56.600 --> 3:04:01.480\n I'm really, I feel, I can become comfortable\n\n3:04:01.480 --> 3:04:03.880\n in lots and lots of places, you know, not everywhere,\n\n3:04:03.880 --> 3:04:07.080\n but, you know, along class lines for sort of white,\n\n3:04:07.080 --> 3:04:09.200\n you know, even white ethnic workers,\n\n3:04:09.200 --> 3:04:10.720\n like that's, you know,\n\n3:04:10.720 --> 3:04:13.080\n I can move in those spaces fairly easily.\n\n3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:16.200\n I mean, not entirely, there was one time\n\n3:04:16.200 --> 3:04:17.440\n where I was like, okay, you know,\n\n3:04:17.440 --> 3:04:19.360\n and I grew up around people who worked on cars.\n\n3:04:19.360 --> 3:04:21.120\n I'd been to drag races in NASCAR\n\n3:04:21.120 --> 3:04:24.520\n and I'd been to, you know, Colgate University.\n\n3:04:24.520 --> 3:04:26.720\n And so I'd, and I think that was probably\n\n3:04:26.720 --> 3:04:28.360\n my initial training was, you know,\n\n3:04:28.360 --> 3:04:32.480\n being this just working class kid who ends up in this,\n\n3:04:32.480 --> 3:04:36.160\n you know, sort of blue blood, small liberal arts college\n\n3:04:36.160 --> 3:04:39.600\n and just feeling like, you know,\n\n3:04:39.600 --> 3:04:41.960\n both having the entire world opened up to me,\n\n3:04:41.960 --> 3:04:43.840\n like philosophy and Buddhism\n\n3:04:43.840 --> 3:04:46.720\n and things that I had never heard of, you know,\n\n3:04:46.720 --> 3:04:48.920\n and just became totally obsessed with\n\n3:04:48.920 --> 3:04:52.400\n and just like, you know, just following my interests.\n\n3:04:52.400 --> 3:04:55.400\n But also culturally perhaps didn't feel like you fit in.\n\n3:04:55.400 --> 3:04:57.800\n Feeling like just a fish out of water.\n\n3:04:57.800 --> 3:04:59.840\n I just, you know, but, and at the same time\n\n3:04:59.840 --> 3:05:02.120\n that sort of drove me in the sense\n\n3:05:02.120 --> 3:05:04.320\n that it drove an opening of my mind\n\n3:05:04.320 --> 3:05:06.080\n because I couldn't understand it.\n\n3:05:06.080 --> 3:05:09.800\n You know, I was like, I didn't know that this world existed.\n\n3:05:09.800 --> 3:05:11.720\n I don't understand.\n\n3:05:11.720 --> 3:05:14.640\n And I think maybe that's where my real first step\n\n3:05:14.640 --> 3:05:17.120\n in trying to understand other people\n\n3:05:17.120 --> 3:05:18.560\n because they were my friends, you know?\n\n3:05:18.560 --> 3:05:19.880\n I mean, they were my teammates.\n\n3:05:19.880 --> 3:05:21.240\n I played lacrosse in college.\n\n3:05:21.240 --> 3:05:22.760\n So like, you know, I was close to people\n\n3:05:22.760 --> 3:05:25.840\n who came from such different backgrounds than I did.\n\n3:05:25.840 --> 3:05:29.320\n And I just, I was so confused, you know?\n\n3:05:29.320 --> 3:05:31.960\n And so I think I learned to learn\n\n3:05:31.960 --> 3:05:34.160\n and then, you know, sort of went from there.\n\n3:05:34.160 --> 3:05:36.000\n And then develop your fascination with people.\n\n3:05:36.000 --> 3:05:38.960\n And the funny thing is you went from trucking now\n\n3:05:38.960 --> 3:05:40.240\n to autonomous trucks.\n\n3:05:40.240 --> 3:05:41.720\n I mean, this is speaking of not being able\n\n3:05:41.720 --> 3:05:44.000\n to connect the dots and, you know,\n\n3:05:44.000 --> 3:05:46.560\n your life in the next 10 years\n\n3:05:46.560 --> 3:05:48.920\n could take very interesting directions\n\n3:05:48.920 --> 3:05:50.200\n that are very difficult to,\n\n3:05:50.200 --> 3:05:53.320\n first of all, us meeting is a funny little thing\n\n3:05:53.320 --> 3:05:57.280\n given the things I'm working on with robots currently.\n\n3:05:57.280 --> 3:06:00.720\n But, you know, it may not relate to trucks at all.\n\n3:06:00.720 --> 3:06:03.280\n There's a, at a certain point,\n\n3:06:03.280 --> 3:06:06.600\n autonomous trucks are just robots.\n\n3:06:06.600 --> 3:06:08.680\n And then it starts getting into a conversation\n\n3:06:08.680 --> 3:06:11.600\n about the roles of robots in society.\n\n3:06:11.600 --> 3:06:15.560\n Yeah, and the roles of humans and robots.\n\n3:06:15.560 --> 3:06:18.360\n And that interplay is right up your alley.\n\n3:06:19.240 --> 3:06:20.080\n Yeah.\n\n3:06:20.080 --> 3:06:21.960\n As somebody who deeply cares about humans\n\n3:06:21.960 --> 3:06:25.080\n and have somehow found themselves studying robots.\n\n3:06:25.080 --> 3:06:26.160\n Yeah, no, it's crazy.\n\n3:06:26.160 --> 3:06:28.680\n I mean, even four or five years ago,\n\n3:06:28.680 --> 3:06:30.440\n I would, if you had asked me\n\n3:06:30.440 --> 3:06:32.120\n if I was gonna be studying trucking still,\n\n3:06:32.120 --> 3:06:33.560\n I would have said no.\n\n3:06:33.560 --> 3:06:36.840\n And so my advice is, I think if I was gonna give advice,\n\n3:06:36.840 --> 3:06:38.520\n you know, is, you know,\n\n3:06:38.520 --> 3:06:40.560\n you can't connect the dots looking forward.\n\n3:06:40.560 --> 3:06:43.440\n You just gotta follow what interests you, you know?\n\n3:06:43.440 --> 3:06:47.480\n And I think we downplay, right,\n\n3:06:47.480 --> 3:06:50.600\n that when we talk to, you know, kids,\n\n3:06:50.600 --> 3:06:52.360\n especially, you know, if you have some bright gifted kid\n\n3:06:52.360 --> 3:06:54.560\n that gets identified as like, oh, you could go somewhere.\n\n3:06:54.560 --> 3:06:55.960\n Then we're like, we feed them stuff.\n\n3:06:55.960 --> 3:06:57.080\n You're like, we'll learn the piano\n\n3:06:57.080 --> 3:06:58.640\n and learn another language, right?\n\n3:06:58.640 --> 3:06:59.560\n Or learn robotics.\n\n3:07:00.880 --> 3:07:02.840\n And then we tell other kids like,\n\n3:07:02.840 --> 3:07:04.080\n oh, learn a trade, you know,\n\n3:07:04.080 --> 3:07:05.320\n like figure out what's gonna pay well.\n\n3:07:05.320 --> 3:07:06.800\n And not that there's anything against trades.\n\n3:07:06.800 --> 3:07:10.040\n I think everyone should learn like manual skills\n\n3:07:10.040 --> 3:07:10.880\n to make things.\n\n3:07:10.880 --> 3:07:13.720\n I think it's incredibly satisfying and wonderful,\n\n3:07:13.720 --> 3:07:15.080\n and we need more of that.\n\n3:07:15.080 --> 3:07:18.200\n But also, you know, tell, you know, all kids,\n\n3:07:18.200 --> 3:07:20.720\n it's okay to like take a class in something random\n\n3:07:20.720 --> 3:07:22.040\n that you don't think you're gonna get\n\n3:07:22.040 --> 3:07:23.920\n any economic return on.\n\n3:07:23.920 --> 3:07:26.440\n Well, because maybe you will end up going into a trade,\n\n3:07:26.440 --> 3:07:30.040\n but that class that you took in studio art\n\n3:07:30.040 --> 3:07:31.960\n is gonna mean that, you know,\n\n3:07:31.960 --> 3:07:33.640\n you look at buildings differently, right?\n\n3:07:33.640 --> 3:07:36.440\n Or you end up sort of putting your own stamp on,\n\n3:07:36.440 --> 3:07:38.160\n you know, woodworking, you know?\n\n3:07:38.160 --> 3:07:40.760\n It just, I think that's the key is like,\n\n3:07:40.760 --> 3:07:43.040\n follow, you know, it's cheesy\n\n3:07:43.040 --> 3:07:44.520\n because everybody says, follow your passion.\n\n3:07:44.520 --> 3:07:48.680\n But you know, we say that, and then we just, you know,\n\n3:07:48.680 --> 3:07:51.440\n the 90% of what people hear is, you know,\n\n3:07:51.440 --> 3:07:54.160\n what's the return on investment for that, you know?\n\n3:07:54.160 --> 3:07:55.880\n It's like, you're a human being.\n\n3:07:55.880 --> 3:07:58.360\n Like things interest you, music interests you,\n\n3:07:58.360 --> 3:08:00.800\n literature interests you, video games interests you,\n\n3:08:00.800 --> 3:08:02.360\n like follow it, you know?\n\n3:08:02.360 --> 3:08:04.680\n Go grab a kayak and go into the pool.\n\n3:08:04.680 --> 3:08:07.240\n Go do something really, no, don't do that.\n\n3:08:07.240 --> 3:08:10.960\n Go do something stupid and something you'll regret\n\n3:08:10.960 --> 3:08:11.800\n a lot later.\n\n3:08:11.800 --> 3:08:13.760\n My poor mother, thank God she didn't know.\n\n3:08:13.760 --> 3:08:16.760\n Well, let me ask, because for a lot of people work,\n\n3:08:16.760 --> 3:08:20.360\n for me it is, quote unquote, work is a source of meaning.\n\n3:08:20.360 --> 3:08:23.520\n And at the core of something we've been talking about\n\n3:08:24.400 --> 3:08:27.200\n with jobs is meaning.\n\n3:08:27.200 --> 3:08:28.640\n So the big ridiculous question,\n\n3:08:28.640 --> 3:08:31.400\n what do you think is the meaning of life?\n\n3:08:31.400 --> 3:08:36.240\n Do you think work for us humans in modern society\n\n3:08:36.240 --> 3:08:38.760\n is as core to that meaning?\n\n3:08:38.760 --> 3:08:42.200\n Is that something you think about in your work?\n\n3:08:42.200 --> 3:08:43.760\n So the deeper question of meaning,\n\n3:08:43.760 --> 3:08:46.680\n not just financial wellbeing and the quality of life,\n\n3:08:46.680 --> 3:08:49.120\n but the deeper search for meaning.\n\n3:08:50.120 --> 3:08:53.680\n Yeah, the meaning of life is love\n\n3:08:53.680 --> 3:08:56.800\n and you can find love in your work.\n\n3:08:57.720 --> 3:09:00.280\n Now, and I don't think everybody can.\n\n3:09:00.280 --> 3:09:02.880\n There are a lot of jobs out there that just, you know,\n\n3:09:02.880 --> 3:09:04.120\n you do it for a paycheck.\n\n3:09:04.120 --> 3:09:08.480\n And I think we do have to be honest about that.\n\n3:09:08.480 --> 3:09:11.200\n There are a lot of people who don't love their jobs\n\n3:09:11.200 --> 3:09:14.480\n and we don't have jobs that they're gonna love.\n\n3:09:15.880 --> 3:09:18.440\n And maybe that's not a sort of realistic,\n\n3:09:18.440 --> 3:09:20.520\n that's a utopia, right?\n\n3:09:20.520 --> 3:09:23.600\n But for those of us that have the luxury,\n\n3:09:23.600 --> 3:09:28.600\n I mean, I think you love what you do that people say that.\n\n3:09:28.600 --> 3:09:33.600\n I think the key for real happiness\n\n3:09:34.280 --> 3:09:36.920\n is to love what you're trying to achieve\n\n3:09:36.920 --> 3:09:39.280\n and maybe love trying to build a company\n\n3:09:39.280 --> 3:09:41.800\n and make a lot of money just for the sake of doing that.\n\n3:09:41.800 --> 3:09:44.400\n But I think the people who are really happy\n\n3:09:44.400 --> 3:09:47.600\n and have great impacts, they love what they do\n\n3:09:47.600 --> 3:09:49.160\n because it has an impact on the world\n\n3:09:49.160 --> 3:09:52.920\n that they think is, it expresses that love, right?\n\n3:09:52.920 --> 3:09:56.600\n And that could be at a counseling center,\n\n3:09:56.600 --> 3:09:59.480\n that could be in your community,\n\n3:09:59.480 --> 3:10:03.160\n that could be sending people to Mars, you know.\n\n3:10:03.160 --> 3:10:05.120\n Well, I also think it doesn't necessarily,\n\n3:10:05.120 --> 3:10:06.960\n the expression of love isn't necessary\n\n3:10:06.960 --> 3:10:09.400\n about helping other people directly.\n\n3:10:09.400 --> 3:10:11.400\n There's something about craftsmanship and skill\n\n3:10:11.400 --> 3:10:12.920\n as we've talked about,\n\n3:10:12.920 --> 3:10:15.720\n that's almost like you're celebrating humanity\n\n3:10:15.720 --> 3:10:20.720\n by like searching for mastery in the task,\n\n3:10:21.400 --> 3:10:25.600\n in the simple, like, especially tasks that people outside me\n\n3:10:25.600 --> 3:10:30.000\n see as menial, as not important.\n\n3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:33.160\n Nevertheless, searching for mastery,\n\n3:10:33.160 --> 3:10:34.760\n for excellence in that task.\n\n3:10:34.760 --> 3:10:36.320\n There's something deeply human to that\n\n3:10:36.320 --> 3:10:40.520\n and also fulfilling that just like driving a truck\n\n3:10:40.520 --> 3:10:42.840\n and getting damn good at it.\n\n3:10:42.840 --> 3:10:45.440\n Like, you know, the best who's ever lived\n\n3:10:45.440 --> 3:10:48.400\n and driving the truck and taking pride in that,\n\n3:10:48.400 --> 3:10:50.760\n that's deeply meaningful.\n\n3:10:50.760 --> 3:10:55.320\n And also like a real celebration of humanity\n\n3:10:55.320 --> 3:10:59.120\n and a real show of love, I think, for humanity.\n\n3:10:59.120 --> 3:11:00.640\n Yeah.\n\n3:11:00.640 --> 3:11:01.960\n Yeah, I just had my floors redone\n\n3:11:01.960 --> 3:11:04.160\n and the guy who did it was an artist.\n\n3:11:04.160 --> 3:11:06.120\n You know, he sanded these old 100 year old floors\n\n3:11:06.120 --> 3:11:08.760\n and made them look gorgeous and this is craft.\n\n3:11:08.760 --> 3:11:10.360\n That's love right there.\n\n3:11:10.360 --> 3:11:12.560\n Yeah, I mean, he showed us some love.\n\n3:11:12.560 --> 3:11:17.320\n The product was just like, is enriching our lives.\n\n3:11:17.320 --> 3:11:19.440\n Steve, this was an amazing conversation.\n\n3:11:19.440 --> 3:11:21.840\n We've covered a lot of ground, your work,\n\n3:11:21.840 --> 3:11:24.760\n just like you said, impossible to connect the dots,\n\n3:11:24.760 --> 3:11:28.240\n but I'm glad you did all the amazing work you did.\n\n3:11:28.240 --> 3:11:31.240\n You're exploring human nature at the core\n\n3:11:31.240 --> 3:11:35.000\n of what America is, the blue collar America.\n\n3:11:35.000 --> 3:11:36.360\n So thank you for your work.\n\n3:11:36.360 --> 3:11:38.720\n Thank you for the care and the love you put in your work.\n\n3:11:38.720 --> 3:11:40.240\n And thank you so much for spending\n\n3:11:40.240 --> 3:11:42.320\n your valuable time with me.\n\n3:11:42.320 --> 3:11:43.440\n I appreciate it, Lex.\n\n3:11:43.440 --> 3:11:45.960\n I'm a big fan, so it's just been great to be on.\n\n3:11:47.120 --> 3:11:49.000\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n3:11:49.000 --> 3:11:50.560\n with Steve Vasile.\n\n3:11:50.560 --> 3:11:52.000\n To support this podcast,\n\n3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:54.760\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n3:11:54.760 --> 3:11:56.720\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n3:11:56.720 --> 3:11:58.440\n from Napoleon Hill.\n\n3:11:58.440 --> 3:12:00.800\n If you cannot do great things,\n\n3:12:00.800 --> 3:12:03.760\n do small things in a great way.\n\n3:12:03.760 --> 3:12:21.280\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
