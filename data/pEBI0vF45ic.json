00:10.640\n that's generally recognized as the Nobel Prize of Computing.\n\n00:10.640 --> 00:12.400\n He's one of the seminal figures\n\n00:12.400 --> 00:14.440\n in the field of artificial intelligence,\n\n00:14.440 --> 00:16.640\n computer science, and statistics.\n\n00:16.640 --> 00:19.960\n He has developed and championed probabilistic approaches\n\n00:19.960 --> 00:22.680\n to AI, including Beijing networks,\n\n00:22.680 --> 00:26.040\n and profound ideas in causality in general.\n\n00:26.040 --> 00:29.080\n These ideas are important not just to AI,\n\n00:29.080 --> 00:32.800\n but to our understanding and practice of science.\n\n00:32.800 --> 00:35.840\n But in the field of AI, the idea of causality,\n\n00:35.840 --> 00:39.400\n cause and effect, to many, lie at the core\n\n00:39.400 --> 00:42.080\n of what is currently missing and what must be developed\n\n00:42.080 --> 00:45.060\n in order to build truly intelligent systems.\n\n00:46.080 --> 00:48.000\n For this reason, and many others,\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:50.760\n his work is worth returning to often.\n\n00:50.760 --> 00:54.200\n I recommend his most recent book called Book of Why\n\n00:54.200 --> 00:57.160\n that presents key ideas from a lifetime of work\n\n00:57.160 --> 01:00.440\n in a way that is accessible to the general public.\n\n01:00.440 --> 01:03.480\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:03.480 --> 01:05.880\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:05.880 --> 01:07.840\n give it five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n01:07.840 --> 01:11.360\n support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter\n\n01:11.360 --> 01:15.320\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n01:15.320 --> 01:18.200\n If you leave a review on Apple Podcasts especially,\n\n01:18.200 --> 01:20.960\n but also a cast box or comment on YouTube,\n\n01:20.960 --> 01:23.920\n consider mentioning topics, people, ideas, questions,\n\n01:23.920 --> 01:26.120\n quotes, and science, tech, and philosophy\n\n01:26.120 --> 01:29.560\n you find interesting, and I'll read them on this podcast.\n\n01:29.560 --> 01:31.960\n I won't call out names, but I love comments\n\n01:31.960 --> 01:33.880\n with kindness and thoughtfulness in them,\n\n01:33.880 --> 01:35.760\n so I thought I'd share them with you.\n\n01:35.760 --> 01:37.840\n Someone on YouTube highlighted a quote\n\n01:37.840 --> 01:40.040\n from the conversation with Noam Chomsky,\n\n01:40.040 --> 01:42.800\n where he said that the significance of your life\n\n01:42.800 --> 01:44.780\n is something you create.\n\n01:44.780 --> 01:46.600\n I like this line as well.\n\n01:46.600 --> 01:49.880\n On most days, the existentialist approach to life\n\n01:49.880 --> 01:53.660\n is one I find liberating and fulfilling.\n\n01:53.660 --> 01:55.040\n I recently started doing ads\n\n01:55.040 --> 01:56.640\n at the end of the introduction.\n\n01:56.640 --> 01:59.400\n I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode,\n\n01:59.400 --> 02:01.080\n and never any ads in the middle\n\n02:01.080 --> 02:03.280\n that break the flow of the conversation.\n\n02:03.280 --> 02:04.760\n I hope that works for you\n\n02:04.760 --> 02:07.160\n and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n02:08.280 --> 02:10.600\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n02:10.600 --> 02:13.040\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n02:13.040 --> 02:15.520\n I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,\n\n02:15.520 --> 02:17.420\n but you can also use it to buy, sell,\n\n02:17.420 --> 02:20.100\n and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.\n\n02:20.100 --> 02:22.800\n Cash App also has a new investing feature.\n\n02:22.800 --> 02:25.860\n You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,\n\n02:25.860 --> 02:28.040\n no matter what the stock price is.\n\n02:28.040 --> 02:30.720\n Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,\n\n02:30.720 --> 02:34.280\n a subsidiary of Square, a member of SIPC.\n\n02:34.280 --> 02:36.600\n I'm excited to be working with Cash App\n\n02:36.600 --> 02:39.940\n to support one of my favorite organizations called First,\n\n02:39.940 --> 02:43.440\n best known for their first robotics and Lego competitions.\n\n02:43.440 --> 02:47.120\n They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students\n\n02:47.120 --> 02:49.000\n in over 110 countries,\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:51.760\n and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,\n\n02:51.760 --> 02:53.120\n which means the donated money\n\n02:53.120 --> 02:56.000\n is used to the maximum effectiveness.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.680\n When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play,\n\n02:58.680 --> 03:02.640\n and use the code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10,\n\n03:02.640 --> 03:05.600\n and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,\n\n03:05.600 --> 03:07.560\n which again, is an organization\n\n03:07.560 --> 03:10.120\n that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys\n\n03:10.120 --> 03:12.800\n to dream of engineering a better world.\n\n03:12.800 --> 03:16.940\n And now, here's my conversation with Judea Pearl.\n\n03:18.080 --> 03:19.720\n You mentioned in an interview\n\n03:19.720 --> 03:21.840\n that science is not a collection of facts,\n\n03:21.840 --> 03:23.960\n but a constant human struggle\n\n03:23.960 --> 03:25.560\n with the mysteries of nature.\n\n03:26.700 --> 03:29.240\n What was the first mystery that you can recall\n\n03:29.240 --> 03:30.800\n that hooked you, that kept you in the creaset?\n\n03:30.800 --> 03:33.480\n Oh, the first mystery, that's a good one.\n\n03:34.440 --> 03:36.240\n Yeah, I remember that.\n\n03:37.840 --> 03:40.000\n I had a fever for three days.\n\n03:41.440 --> 03:45.680\n And when I learned about Descartes, analytic geometry,\n\n03:45.680 --> 03:49.880\n and I found out that you can do all the construction\n\n03:49.880 --> 03:51.820\n in geometry using algebra.\n\n03:52.880 --> 03:54.480\n And I couldn't get over it.\n\n03:54.480 --> 03:56.360\n I simply couldn't get out of bed.\n\n03:58.280 --> 04:01.900\n So what kind of world does analytic geometry unlock?\n\n04:02.800 --> 04:05.580\n Well, it connects algebra with geometry.\n\n04:07.320 --> 04:09.360\n Okay, so Descartes had the idea\n\n04:09.360 --> 04:14.360\n that geometrical construction and geometrical theorems\n\n04:14.360 --> 04:17.520\n and assumptions can be articulated\n\n04:17.520 --> 04:19.520\n in the language of algebra,\n\n04:19.520 --> 04:24.520\n which means that all the proof that we did in high school,\n\n04:24.840 --> 04:28.560\n and trying to prove that the three bisectors\n\n04:28.560 --> 04:32.360\n meet at one point, and that, okay,\n\n04:33.640 --> 04:38.640\n all this can be proven by just shuffling around notation.\n\n04:39.440 --> 04:43.560\n Yeah, that was a traumatic experience.\n\n04:43.560 --> 04:44.400\n That was a traumatic experience.\n\n04:44.400 --> 04:45.520\n For me, it was, I'm telling you.\n\n04:45.520 --> 04:46.960\n So it's the connection\n\n04:46.960 --> 04:49.120\n between the different mathematical disciplines,\n\n04:49.120 --> 04:49.960\n that they all.\n\n04:49.960 --> 04:52.960\n Not in between two different languages.\n\n04:52.960 --> 04:53.800\n Languages.\n\n04:53.800 --> 04:54.640\n Yeah.\n\n04:54.640 --> 04:57.200\n So which mathematic discipline is most beautiful?\n\n04:57.200 --> 04:58.560\n Is geometry it for you?\n\n04:58.560 --> 04:59.440\n Both are beautiful.\n\n04:59.440 --> 05:02.400\n They have almost the same power.\n\n05:02.400 --> 05:04.920\n But there's a visual element to geometry, being a.\n\n05:04.920 --> 05:08.080\n Visually, it's more transparent.\n\n05:08.080 --> 05:10.680\n But once you get over to algebra,\n\n05:10.680 --> 05:14.400\n then the linear equation is a straight line.\n\n05:14.400 --> 05:18.160\n This translation is easily absorbed, okay?\n\n05:18.160 --> 05:22.760\n And to pass a tangent to a circle,\n\n05:22.760 --> 05:25.480\n you know, you have the basic theorems,\n\n05:25.480 --> 05:27.480\n and you can do it with algebra.\n\n05:27.480 --> 05:31.520\n So but the transition from one to another was really,\n\n05:31.520 --> 05:34.120\n I thought that Descartes was the greatest mathematician\n\n05:34.120 --> 05:35.160\n of all times.\n\n05:35.160 --> 05:40.160\n So you have been at the, if you think of engineering\n\n05:40.840 --> 05:43.240\n and mathematics as a spectrum.\n\n05:43.240 --> 05:44.080\n Yes.\n\n05:44.080 --> 05:49.080\n You have been, you have walked casually along this spectrum\n\n05:49.200 --> 05:51.520\n throughout your life.\n\n05:51.520 --> 05:53.000\n You know, a little bit of engineering,\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:54.920\n and then, you know,\n\n05:55.920 --> 05:58.800\n you've done a little bit of mathematics here and there.\n\n05:58.800 --> 05:59.640\n Not a little bit.\n\n05:59.640 --> 06:04.080\n I mean, we got a very solid background in mathematics,\n\n06:04.080 --> 06:07.080\n because our teachers were geniuses.\n\n06:07.080 --> 06:09.720\n Our teachers came from Germany in the 1930s,\n\n06:09.720 --> 06:11.880\n running away from Hitler.\n\n06:11.880 --> 06:15.080\n They left their careers in Heidelberg and Berlin,\n\n06:15.080 --> 06:17.840\n and came to teach high school in Israel.\n\n06:17.840 --> 06:21.600\n And we were the beneficiary of that experiment.\n\n06:21.600 --> 06:25.200\n So I, and they taught us math the good way.\n\n06:25.200 --> 06:26.720\n What's the good way to teach math?\n\n06:26.720 --> 06:27.720\n Chronologically.\n\n06:29.040 --> 06:29.880\n The people.\n\n06:29.880 --> 06:33.320\n The people behind the theorems, yeah.\n\n06:33.320 --> 06:37.720\n Their cousins, and their nieces, and their faces.\n\n06:39.040 --> 06:41.520\n And how they jumped from the bathtub when they scream,\n\n06:41.520 --> 06:42.360\n Eureka!\n\n06:43.480 --> 06:45.160\n And ran naked in town.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:49.240\n So you're almost educated as a historian of math.\n\n06:49.240 --> 06:51.920\n No, we just got a glimpse of that history\n\n06:51.920 --> 06:53.760\n together with a theorem,\n\n06:53.760 --> 06:58.200\n so every exercise in math was connected with a person.\n\n06:59.600 --> 07:01.040\n And the time of the person.\n\n07:01.040 --> 07:03.520\n The period.\n\n07:03.520 --> 07:05.600\n The period, also mathematically speaking.\n\n07:05.600 --> 07:06.880\n Mathematically speaking, yes.\n\n07:06.880 --> 07:09.040\n Not the politics, no.\n\n07:09.040 --> 07:14.000\n So, and then in university,\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.240\n you have gone on to do engineering.\n\n07:16.240 --> 07:17.200\n Yeah.\n\n07:17.200 --> 07:20.680\n I get a B.S. in engineering and a technical, right?\n\n07:20.680 --> 07:25.600\n And then I moved here for graduate work,\n\n07:25.600 --> 07:30.280\n and I got, I did engineering in addition to physics\n\n07:30.280 --> 07:35.280\n in Rutgers, and it combined very nicely with my thesis,\n\n07:35.840 --> 07:39.280\n which I did in RCA Laboratories in superconductivity.\n\n07:40.480 --> 07:43.760\n And then somehow thought to switch\n\n07:43.760 --> 07:46.720\n to almost computer science, software,\n\n07:46.720 --> 07:50.800\n even, not switch, but long to become,\n\n07:50.800 --> 07:53.000\n to get into software engineering a little bit.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:53.840\n Yes.\n\n07:53.840 --> 07:56.200\n And programming, if you can call it that in the 70s.\n\n07:56.200 --> 07:58.120\n So there's all these disciplines.\n\n07:58.120 --> 07:58.960\n Yeah.\n\n07:58.960 --> 08:02.880\n So to pick a favorite, in terms of engineering\n\n08:02.880 --> 08:07.120\n and mathematics, which path do you think has more beauty?\n\n08:07.120 --> 08:08.600\n Which path has more power?\n\n08:08.600 --> 08:10.560\n It's hard to choose, no.\n\n08:10.560 --> 08:14.640\n I enjoy doing physics, and even have a vortex\n\n08:14.640 --> 08:16.000\n named on my name.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:20.840\n So I have investment in immortality.\n\n08:23.400 --> 08:25.160\n So what is a vortex?\n\n08:25.160 --> 08:27.000\n Vortex is in superconductivity.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:27.840\n In the superconductivity, yeah.\n\n08:27.840 --> 08:30.880\n You have permanent current swirling around.\n\n08:30.880 --> 08:34.560\n One way or the other, you can have a store one or zero\n\n08:34.560 --> 08:35.400\n for a computer.\n\n08:35.400 --> 08:39.680\n That's what we worked on in the 1960 in RCA.\n\n08:39.680 --> 08:44.080\n And I discovered a few nice phenomena with the vortices.\n\n08:44.080 --> 08:44.920\n You push current and they move.\n\n08:44.920 --> 08:46.600\n So that's a pearl vortex.\n\n08:46.600 --> 08:50.240\n Pearl vortex, right, you can Google it, right?\n\n08:50.240 --> 08:52.360\n I didn't know about it, but the physicists,\n\n08:52.360 --> 08:57.200\n they picked up on my thesis, on my PhD thesis,\n\n08:57.200 --> 09:02.200\n and it becomes popular when thin film superconductors\n\n09:03.240 --> 09:06.920\n became important for high temperature superconductors.\n\n09:06.920 --> 09:10.840\n So they called it pearl vortex without my knowledge.\n\n09:10.840 --> 09:13.800\n I discovered it only about 15 years ago.\n\n09:14.760 --> 09:17.560\n You have footprints in all of the sciences.\n\n09:17.560 --> 09:20.960\n So let's talk about the universe a little bit.\n\n09:20.960 --> 09:23.880\n Is the universe at the lowest level deterministic\n\n09:23.880 --> 09:27.400\n or stochastic in your amateur philosophy view?\n\n09:27.400 --> 09:30.120\n Put another way, does God play dice?\n\n09:30.120 --> 09:33.000\n We know it is stochastic, right?\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.160\n Today, today we think it is stochastic.\n\n09:35.160 --> 09:36.000\n Yes.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:40.120\n We think because we have the Heisenberg uncertainty principle\n\n09:40.120 --> 09:44.680\n and we have some experiments to confirm that.\n\n09:45.760 --> 09:47.960\n All we have is experiments to confirm it.\n\n09:47.960 --> 09:49.240\n We don't understand why.\n\n09:50.400 --> 09:51.440\n Why is already?\n\n09:51.440 --> 09:52.960\n You wrote a book about why.\n\n09:52.960 --> 09:57.240\n Yeah, it's a puzzle.\n\n09:57.240 --> 10:02.240\n It's a puzzle that you have the dice flipping machine,\n\n10:02.400 --> 10:07.400\n oh God, and the result of the flipping\n\n10:08.560 --> 10:12.280\n propagate with the speed faster than the speed of light.\n\n10:12.280 --> 10:14.240\n We can't explain it, okay?\n\n10:14.240 --> 10:19.240\n So, but it only governs microscopic phenomena.\n\n10:19.240 --> 10:21.320\n Microscopic phenomena.\n\n10:21.320 --> 10:23.560\n So you don't think of quantum mechanics\n\n10:23.560 --> 10:28.240\n as useful for understanding the nature of reality?\n\n10:28.240 --> 10:30.400\n No, diversionary.\n\n10:30.400 --> 10:34.520\n So in your thinking, the world might\n\n10:34.520 --> 10:36.000\n as well be deterministic.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.480\n The world is deterministic,\n\n10:38.480 --> 10:42.800\n and as far as the neuron firing is concerned,\n\n10:42.800 --> 10:47.240\n it is deterministic to first approximation.\n\n10:47.240 --> 10:48.920\n What about free will?\n\n10:48.920 --> 10:52.920\n Free will is also a nice exercise.\n\n10:52.920 --> 10:57.920\n Free will is an illusion that we AI people are gonna solve.\n\n10:59.320 --> 11:01.800\n So what do you think once we solve it,\n\n11:01.800 --> 11:03.360\n that solution will look like?\n\n11:03.360 --> 11:04.200\n Once we put it in the page.\n\n11:04.200 --> 11:06.240\n The solution will look like,\n\n11:06.240 --> 11:08.920\n first of all, it will look like a machine.\n\n11:08.920 --> 11:12.560\n A machine that act as though it has free will.\n\n11:12.560 --> 11:14.760\n It communicates with other machines\n\n11:14.760 --> 11:17.160\n as though they have free will,\n\n11:17.160 --> 11:19.480\n and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference\n\n11:19.480 --> 11:21.560\n between a machine that does\n\n11:21.560 --> 11:24.680\n and a machine that doesn't have free will, okay?\n\n11:24.680 --> 11:26.840\n So the illusion, it propagates the illusion\n\n11:26.840 --> 11:28.960\n of free will amongst the other machines.\n\n11:28.960 --> 11:33.120\n And faking it is having it, okay?\n\n11:33.120 --> 11:35.120\n That's what Turing test is all about.\n\n11:35.120 --> 11:37.160\n Faking intelligence is intelligent\n\n11:37.160 --> 11:41.080\n because it's not easy to fake.\n\n11:41.080 --> 11:43.200\n It's very hard to fake,\n\n11:43.200 --> 11:45.200\n and you can only fake if you have it.\n\n11:45.200 --> 11:50.200\n So that's such a beautiful statement.\n\n11:54.080 --> 11:57.960\n Yeah, you can't fake it if you don't have it, yeah.\n\n11:59.520 --> 12:04.520\n So let's begin at the beginning with probability,\n\n12:06.800 --> 12:09.360\n both philosophically and mathematically.\n\n12:09.360 --> 12:11.560\n What does it mean to say the probability\n\n12:11.560 --> 12:15.160\n of something happening is 50%?\n\n12:15.160 --> 12:16.960\n What is probability?\n\n12:16.960 --> 12:18.680\n It's a degree of uncertainty\n\n12:18.680 --> 12:22.400\n that an agent has about the world.\n\n12:22.400 --> 12:24.760\n You're still expressing some knowledge in that statement.\n\n12:24.760 --> 12:26.000\n Of course.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.840\n If the probability is 90%,\n\n12:27.840 --> 12:29.800\n it's absolutely a different kind of knowledge\n\n12:29.800 --> 12:32.480\n than if it is 10%.\n\n12:32.480 --> 12:36.080\n But it's still not solid knowledge, it's...\n\n12:36.080 --> 12:38.520\n It is solid knowledge, but hey,\n\n12:38.520 --> 12:43.520\n if you tell me that 90% assurance smoking\n\n12:43.520 --> 12:48.520\n will give you lung cancer in five years versus 10%,\n\n12:48.880 --> 12:52.400\n it's a piece of useful knowledge.\n\n12:52.400 --> 12:56.120\n So the statistical view of the universe,\n\n12:56.120 --> 12:57.600\n why is it useful?\n\n12:57.600 --> 13:00.760\n So we're swimming in complete uncertainty,\n\n13:00.760 --> 13:01.600\n most of everything around us.\n\n13:01.600 --> 13:06.120\n It allows you to predict things with a certain probability,\n\n13:06.120 --> 13:09.240\n and computing those probabilities are very useful.\n\n13:09.240 --> 13:14.160\n That's the whole idea of prediction.\n\n13:15.080 --> 13:18.160\n And you need prediction to be able to survive.\n\n13:18.160 --> 13:19.640\n If you can't predict the future,\n\n13:19.640 --> 13:22.320\n then you're just crossing the street,\n\n13:22.320 --> 13:25.040\n will be extremely fearful.\n\n13:26.080 --> 13:28.840\n And so you've done a lot of work in causation,\n\n13:28.840 --> 13:32.120\n and so let's think about correlation.\n\n13:32.120 --> 13:34.320\n I started with probability.\n\n13:34.320 --> 13:35.640\n You started with probability.\n\n13:35.640 --> 13:38.760\n You've invented the Bayesian networks.\n\n13:38.760 --> 13:39.600\n Yeah.\n\n13:39.600 --> 13:43.880\n And so we'll dance back and forth\n\n13:43.880 --> 13:47.480\n between these levels of uncertainty.\n\n13:47.480 --> 13:49.320\n But what is correlation?\n\n13:49.320 --> 13:50.360\n What is it?\n\n13:50.360 --> 13:54.000\n So probability of something happening is something,\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.480\n but then there's a bunch of things happening.\n\n13:56.480 --> 13:58.680\n And sometimes they happen together,\n\n13:58.680 --> 14:00.760\n sometimes not, they're independent or not.\n\n14:00.760 --> 14:03.640\n So how do you think about correlation of things?\n\n14:03.640 --> 14:06.280\n Correlation occurs when two things vary together\n\n14:06.280 --> 14:09.720\n over a very long time is one way of measuring it.\n\n14:09.720 --> 14:11.840\n Or when you have a bunch of variables\n\n14:11.840 --> 14:14.560\n that they all vary cohesively,\n\n14:15.880 --> 14:18.600\n then because we have a correlation here.\n\n14:18.600 --> 14:21.720\n And usually when we think about correlation,\n\n14:21.720 --> 14:24.400\n we really think causally.\n\n14:24.400 --> 14:27.960\n Things cannot be correlated unless there is a reason\n\n14:27.960 --> 14:30.280\n for them to vary together.\n\n14:30.280 --> 14:32.040\n Why should they vary together?\n\n14:32.040 --> 14:35.560\n If they don't see each other, why should they vary together?\n\n14:35.560 --> 14:38.240\n So underlying it somewhere is causation.\n\n14:38.240 --> 14:39.240\n Yes.\n\n14:39.240 --> 14:43.160\n Hidden in our intuition, there is a notion of causation\n\n14:43.160 --> 14:48.160\n because we cannot grasp any other logic except causation.\n\n14:48.600 --> 14:53.600\n And how does conditional probability differ from causation?\n\n14:55.600 --> 14:57.920\n So what is conditional probability?\n\n14:57.920 --> 15:00.560\n Conditional probability, how things vary\n\n15:00.560 --> 15:05.040\n when one of them stays the same.\n\n15:05.040 --> 15:09.320\n Now staying the same means that I have chosen\n\n15:09.320 --> 15:11.720\n to look only at those incidents\n\n15:11.720 --> 15:16.120\n where the guy has the same value as previous one.\n\n15:16.120 --> 15:19.280\n It's my choice as an experimenter.\n\n15:19.280 --> 15:22.280\n So things that are not correlated before\n\n15:22.280 --> 15:24.240\n could become correlated.\n\n15:24.240 --> 15:26.840\n Like for instance, if I have two coins\n\n15:26.840 --> 15:29.240\n which are uncorrelated, okay,\n\n15:29.240 --> 15:33.760\n and I choose only those flippings, experiments\n\n15:33.760 --> 15:36.680\n in which a bell rings, and the bell rings\n\n15:36.680 --> 15:40.760\n when at least one of them is a tail, okay,\n\n15:40.760 --> 15:44.360\n then suddenly I see correlation between the two coins\n\n15:44.360 --> 15:48.400\n because I only look at the cases where the bell rang.\n\n15:49.280 --> 15:53.680\n You see, it's my design, with my ignorance essentially,\n\n15:53.680 --> 15:58.680\n with my audacity to ignore certain incidents,\n\n15:58.680 --> 16:03.680\n I suddenly create a correlation\n\n16:04.760 --> 16:06.760\n where it doesn't exist physically.\n\n16:07.760 --> 16:11.400\n Right, so that's, you just outlined one of the flaws\n\n16:11.400 --> 16:14.960\n of observing the world and trying to infer something\n\n16:14.960 --> 16:16.080\n from the math about the world\n\n16:16.080 --> 16:17.520\n from looking at the correlation.\n\n16:17.520 --> 16:20.960\n I don't look at it as a flaw, the world works like that.\n\n16:20.960 --> 16:24.960\n But the flaws comes if we try to impose\n\n16:24.960 --> 16:29.960\n causal logic on correlation, it doesn't work too well.\n\n16:34.680 --> 16:36.320\n I mean, but that's exactly what we do.\n\n16:36.320 --> 16:40.040\n That's what, that has been the majority of science.\n\n16:40.040 --> 16:45.040\n The majority of naive science, the decisions know it.\n\n16:45.040 --> 16:47.840\n The decisions know that if you condition\n\n16:47.840 --> 16:50.960\n on a third variable, then you can destroy\n\n16:50.960 --> 16:55.640\n or create correlations among two other variables.\n\n16:55.640 --> 16:57.360\n They know it, it's in their data.\n\n16:58.480 --> 17:01.120\n It's nothing surprising, that's why they all dismiss\n\n17:01.120 --> 17:04.120\n the Simpson Paradox, ah, we know it.\n\n17:04.120 --> 17:05.880\n They don't know anything about it.\n\n17:07.280 --> 17:09.680\n Well, there's disciplines like psychology\n\n17:09.680 --> 17:12.880\n where all the variables are hard to account for.\n\n17:12.880 --> 17:15.200\n And so oftentimes there's a leap\n\n17:15.200 --> 17:17.520\n between correlation to causation.\n\n17:17.520 --> 17:18.840\n You're imposing.\n\n17:18.840 --> 17:21.120\n You're implying a leap.\n\n17:21.120 --> 17:24.440\n Who is trying to get causation from correlation?\n\n17:26.520 --> 17:27.960\n You're not proving causation,\n\n17:27.960 --> 17:31.680\n but you're sort of discussing it,\n\n17:31.680 --> 17:35.360\n implying, sort of hypothesizing with our ability to prove.\n\n17:35.360 --> 17:37.040\n Which discipline you have in mind?\n\n17:37.040 --> 17:40.440\n I'll tell you if they are obsolete,\n\n17:40.440 --> 17:44.240\n or if they are outdated, or they are about to get outdated.\n\n17:44.240 --> 17:45.440\n Yes, yes.\n\n17:45.440 --> 17:46.760\n Tell me which one you have in mind.\n\n17:46.760 --> 17:48.160\n Oh, psychology, you know.\n\n17:48.160 --> 17:50.760\n Psychology, what, is it SEM, structural equation?\n\n17:50.760 --> 17:54.280\n No, no, I was thinking of applied psychology studying.\n\n17:54.280 --> 17:57.200\n For example, we work with human behavior\n\n17:57.200 --> 18:00.360\n in semi autonomous vehicles, how people behave.\n\n18:00.360 --> 18:02.560\n And you have to conduct these studies\n\n18:02.560 --> 18:03.960\n of people driving cars.\n\n18:03.960 --> 18:05.520\n Everything starts with the question.\n\n18:05.520 --> 18:07.800\n What is the research question?\n\n18:07.800 --> 18:09.400\n What is the research question?\n\n18:10.400 --> 18:14.320\n The research question, do people fall asleep\n\n18:14.320 --> 18:18.560\n when the car is driving itself?\n\n18:18.560 --> 18:22.240\n Do they fall asleep, or do they tend to fall asleep\n\n18:22.240 --> 18:23.160\n more frequently?\n\n18:23.160 --> 18:24.000\n More frequently.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.960\n Than the car not driving itself.\n\n18:25.960 --> 18:26.880\n Not driving itself.\n\n18:26.880 --> 18:28.720\n That's a good question, okay.\n\n18:28.720 --> 18:32.480\n And so you measure, you put people in the car\n\n18:32.480 --> 18:33.720\n because it's real world.\n\n18:33.720 --> 18:35.160\n You can't conduct an experiment\n\n18:35.160 --> 18:36.320\n where you control everything.\n\n18:36.320 --> 18:37.840\n Why can't you control?\n\n18:37.840 --> 18:38.680\n You could.\n\n18:38.680 --> 18:43.680\n Why can't you control the automatic module on and off?\n\n18:44.760 --> 18:47.720\n Because it's on road, public.\n\n18:47.720 --> 18:52.680\n I mean, there's aspects to it that's unethical.\n\n18:52.680 --> 18:54.920\n Because it's testing on public roads.\n\n18:54.920 --> 18:56.640\n So you can only use vehicle.\n\n18:56.640 --> 19:00.240\n They have to, the people, the drivers themselves\n\n19:00.240 --> 19:02.840\n have to make that choice themselves.\n\n19:02.840 --> 19:05.080\n And so they regulate that.\n\n19:05.080 --> 19:09.040\n And so you just observe when they drive autonomously\n\n19:09.040 --> 19:10.320\n and when they don't.\n\n19:10.320 --> 19:11.160\n And then.\n\n19:11.160 --> 19:13.120\n But maybe they turn it off when they were very tired.\n\n19:13.120 --> 19:14.520\n Yeah, that kind of thing.\n\n19:14.520 --> 19:16.600\n But you don't know those variables.\n\n19:16.600 --> 19:19.360\n Okay, so that you have now uncontrolled experiment.\n\n19:19.360 --> 19:20.680\n Uncontrolled experiment.\n\n19:20.680 --> 19:23.200\n We call it observational study.\n\n19:23.200 --> 19:27.160\n And we form the correlation detected.\n\n19:27.160 --> 19:30.520\n We have to infer causal relationship.\n\n19:30.520 --> 19:33.440\n Whether it was the automatic piece\n\n19:33.440 --> 19:35.960\n has caused them to fall asleep, or.\n\n19:35.960 --> 19:40.960\n So that is an issue that is about 120 years old.\n\n19:45.440 --> 19:48.640\n I should only go 100 years old, okay.\n\n19:51.400 --> 19:52.840\n Well, maybe it's not.\n\n19:52.840 --> 19:55.240\n Actually I should say it's 2,000 years old.\n\n19:55.240 --> 19:58.520\n Because we have this experiment by Daniel.\n\n19:58.520 --> 20:03.520\n But the Babylonian king that wanted the exiled,\n\n20:07.440 --> 20:12.440\n the people from Israel that were taken in exile\n\n20:12.760 --> 20:14.720\n to Babylon to serve the king.\n\n20:14.720 --> 20:18.080\n He wanted to serve them king's food, which was meat.\n\n20:18.080 --> 20:22.760\n And Daniel as a good Jew couldn't eat non kosher food.\n\n20:22.760 --> 20:26.640\n So he asked them to eat vegetarian food.\n\n20:26.640 --> 20:29.320\n But the king overseer says, I'm sorry,\n\n20:29.320 --> 20:34.320\n but if the king sees that your performance falls below\n\n20:34.760 --> 20:39.360\n that of other kids, he's going to kill me.\n\n20:39.360 --> 20:41.600\n Daniel said, let's make an experiment.\n\n20:41.600 --> 20:44.320\n Let's take four of us from Jerusalem, okay.\n\n20:44.320 --> 20:46.440\n Give us vegetarian food.\n\n20:46.440 --> 20:50.280\n Let's take the other guys to eat the king's food.\n\n20:50.280 --> 20:54.080\n And in about a week's time, we'll test our performance.\n\n20:54.080 --> 20:55.440\n And you know the answer.\n\n20:55.440 --> 20:57.840\n Of course he did the experiment.\n\n20:57.840 --> 21:02.120\n And they were so much better than the others.\n\n21:02.120 --> 21:07.120\n And the kings nominated them to super position in his king.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:10.160\n So it was a first experiment, yes.\n\n21:10.160 --> 21:12.760\n So there was a very simple,\n\n21:12.760 --> 21:15.520\n it's also the same research questions.\n\n21:15.520 --> 21:17.440\n We want to know if vegetarian food\n\n21:18.640 --> 21:23.480\n assist or obstruct your mental ability.\n\n21:23.480 --> 21:28.480\n And okay, so the question is very old one.\n\n21:30.440 --> 21:35.440\n Even Democritus said, if I could discover one cause\n\n21:38.040 --> 21:41.480\n of things, I would rather discover one cause\n\n21:41.480 --> 21:43.720\n and be a king of Persia, okay.\n\n21:43.720 --> 21:48.720\n The task of discovering causes was in the mind\n\n21:48.720 --> 21:53.480\n of ancient people from many, many years ago.\n\n21:53.480 --> 21:58.360\n But the mathematics of doing that was only developed\n\n21:58.360 --> 22:00.480\n in the 1920s.\n\n22:00.480 --> 22:05.120\n So science has left us orphan, okay.\n\n22:05.120 --> 22:08.320\n Science has not provided us with the mathematics\n\n22:08.320 --> 22:12.000\n to capture the idea of X causes Y\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.320\n and Y does not cause X.\n\n22:14.320 --> 22:17.400\n Because all the question of physics are symmetrical,\n\n22:17.400 --> 22:20.660\n algebraic, the equality sign goes both ways.\n\n22:21.680 --> 22:23.120\n Okay, let's look at machine learning.\n\n22:23.120 --> 22:26.880\n Machine learning today, if you look at deep neural networks,\n\n22:26.880 --> 22:31.880\n you can think of it as kind of conditional probability\n\n22:32.840 --> 22:33.680\n estimators.\n\n22:33.680 --> 22:35.520\n Correct, beautiful.\n\n22:35.520 --> 22:38.120\n So where did you say that?\n\n22:39.280 --> 22:41.520\n Conditional probability estimators.\n\n22:41.520 --> 22:44.440\n None of the machine learning people clevered you?\n\n22:45.360 --> 22:46.840\n Attacked you?\n\n22:46.840 --> 22:51.840\n Listen, most people, and this is why today's conversation\n\n22:52.400 --> 22:55.800\n I think is interesting, is most people would agree with you.\n\n22:55.800 --> 22:58.680\n There's certain aspects that are just effective today,\n\n22:58.680 --> 23:02.440\n but we're going to hit a wall and there's a lot of ideas.\n\n23:02.440 --> 23:05.400\n I think you're very right that we're gonna have to return to\n\n23:05.400 --> 23:10.400\n about causality and it would be, let's try to explore it.\n\n23:11.560 --> 23:13.160\n Let's even take a step back.\n\n23:13.160 --> 23:18.160\n You've invented Bayesian networks that look awfully a lot\n\n23:19.800 --> 23:22.040\n like they express something like causation,\n\n23:22.040 --> 23:24.020\n but they don't, not necessarily.\n\n23:25.280 --> 23:28.600\n So how do we turn Bayesian networks\n\n23:28.600 --> 23:30.840\n into expressing causation?\n\n23:30.840 --> 23:33.160\n How do we build causal networks?\n\n23:33.160 --> 23:36.480\n This A causes B, B causes C,\n\n23:36.480 --> 23:38.840\n how do we start to infer that kind of thing?\n\n23:38.840 --> 23:41.460\n We start asking ourselves question,\n\n23:41.460 --> 23:44.520\n what are the factors that would determine\n\n23:44.520 --> 23:46.360\n the value of X?\n\n23:46.360 --> 23:51.360\n X could be blood pressure, death, hunger.\n\n23:53.820 --> 23:56.240\n But these are hypotheses that we propose for ourselves.\n\n23:56.240 --> 23:59.040\n Hypothesis, everything which has to do with causality\n\n23:59.040 --> 24:00.780\n comes from a theory.\n\n24:03.400 --> 24:06.960\n The difference is only how you interrogate\n\n24:06.960 --> 24:09.080\n the theory that you have in your mind.\n\n24:09.080 --> 24:14.080\n So it still needs the human expert to propose.\n\n24:14.280 --> 24:19.280\n You need the human expert to specify the initial model.\n\n24:20.980 --> 24:24.040\n Initial model could be very qualitative.\n\n24:24.040 --> 24:27.040\n Just who listens to whom?\n\n24:27.040 --> 24:31.240\n By whom listen to, I mean one variable listen to the other.\n\n24:31.240 --> 24:34.720\n So I say, okay, the tide is listening to the moon.\n\n24:34.720 --> 24:39.720\n And not to the rooster crow.\n\n24:42.280 --> 24:43.120\n And so forth.\n\n24:43.120 --> 24:46.840\n This is our understanding of the world in which we live.\n\n24:46.840 --> 24:50.340\n Scientific understanding of reality.\n\n24:51.540 --> 24:53.480\n We have to start there.\n\n24:53.480 --> 24:56.960\n Because if we don't know how to handle\n\n24:56.960 --> 24:58.560\n cause and effect relationship,\n\n24:58.560 --> 25:01.240\n when we do have a model,\n\n25:01.240 --> 25:03.720\n and we certainly do not know how to handle it\n\n25:03.720 --> 25:05.400\n when we don't have a model.\n\n25:05.400 --> 25:07.240\n So let's start first.\n\n25:07.240 --> 25:12.160\n In AI, slogan is representation first, discovery second.\n\n25:13.440 --> 25:17.240\n But if I give you all the information that you need,\n\n25:17.240 --> 25:19.840\n can you do anything useful with it?\n\n25:19.840 --> 25:21.520\n That is the first, representation.\n\n25:21.520 --> 25:22.520\n How do you represent it?\n\n25:22.520 --> 25:24.560\n I give you all the knowledge in the world.\n\n25:24.560 --> 25:25.760\n How do you represent it?\n\n25:26.920 --> 25:30.680\n When you represent it, I ask you,\n\n25:30.680 --> 25:33.200\n can you infer X or Y or Z?\n\n25:33.200 --> 25:35.240\n Can you answer certain queries?\n\n25:35.240 --> 25:36.920\n Is it complex?\n\n25:36.920 --> 25:37.840\n Is it polynomial?\n\n25:39.280 --> 25:42.040\n All the computer science exercises we do,\n\n25:42.040 --> 25:47.040\n once you give me a representation for my knowledge,\n\n25:47.260 --> 25:48.280\n then you can ask me,\n\n25:48.280 --> 25:51.680\n now I understand how to represent things.\n\n25:51.680 --> 25:52.800\n How do I discover them?\n\n25:52.800 --> 25:54.040\n It's a secondary thing.\n\n25:54.920 --> 25:57.040\n So first of all, I should echo the statement\n\n25:57.040 --> 25:59.840\n that mathematics and the current,\n\n25:59.840 --> 26:04.280\n much of the machine learning world has not considered\n\n26:04.280 --> 26:07.880\n causation that A causes B, just in anything.\n\n26:07.880 --> 26:12.880\n So that seems like a non obvious thing\n\n26:15.360 --> 26:18.280\n that you think we would have really acknowledged it,\n\n26:18.280 --> 26:19.200\n but we haven't.\n\n26:19.200 --> 26:21.080\n So we have to put that on the table.\n\n26:21.080 --> 26:26.080\n So knowledge, how hard is it to create a knowledge\n\n26:26.420 --> 26:28.480\n from which to work?\n\n26:28.480 --> 26:31.280\n In certain area, it's easy,\n\n26:31.280 --> 26:36.080\n because we have only four or five major variables,\n\n26:37.400 --> 26:41.560\n and an epidemiologist or an economist can put them down,\n\n26:43.440 --> 26:48.440\n what, minimum wage, unemployment, policy, X, Y, Z,\n\n26:52.040 --> 26:54.320\n and start collecting data,\n\n26:54.320 --> 26:59.160\n and quantify the parameters that were left unquantified\n\n27:00.240 --> 27:01.560\n with the initial knowledge.\n\n27:01.560 --> 27:06.560\n That's the routine work that you find\n\n27:07.680 --> 27:12.680\n in experimental psychology, in economics, everywhere.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:16.600\n In the health science, that's a routine thing.\n\n27:16.600 --> 27:18.800\n But I should emphasize,\n\n27:18.800 --> 27:21.240\n you should start with the research question.\n\n27:21.240 --> 27:24.880\n What do you want to estimate?\n\n27:24.880 --> 27:27.480\n Once you have that, you have to have a language\n\n27:27.480 --> 27:30.200\n of expressing what you want to estimate.\n\n27:30.200 --> 27:31.680\n You think it's easy?\n\n27:31.680 --> 27:32.760\n No.\n\n27:32.760 --> 27:34.880\n So we can talk about two things, I think.\n\n27:35.840 --> 27:40.840\n One is how the science of causation is very useful\n\n27:42.920 --> 27:47.360\n for answering certain questions.\n\n27:47.360 --> 27:51.240\n And then the other is, how do we create intelligent systems\n\n27:51.240 --> 27:53.600\n that need to reason with causation?\n\n27:53.600 --> 27:55.200\n So if my research question is,\n\n27:55.200 --> 27:58.640\n how do I pick up this water bottle from the table?\n\n28:00.920 --> 28:03.560\n All of the knowledge that is required\n\n28:03.560 --> 28:05.280\n to be able to do that,\n\n28:05.280 --> 28:07.960\n how do we construct that knowledge base?\n\n28:07.960 --> 28:11.000\n Do we return back to the problem\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.580\n that we didn't solve in the 80s with expert systems?\n\n28:13.580 --> 28:15.440\n Do we have to solve that problem\n\n28:15.440 --> 28:17.860\n of automated construction of knowledge?\n\n28:19.680 --> 28:23.560\n You're talking about the task\n\n28:23.560 --> 28:26.560\n of eliciting knowledge from an expert.\n\n28:26.560 --> 28:28.520\n Task of eliciting knowledge from an expert,\n\n28:28.520 --> 28:31.540\n or the self discovery of more knowledge,\n\n28:32.720 --> 28:34.240\n more and more knowledge.\n\n28:34.240 --> 28:38.600\n So automating the building of knowledge as much as possible.\n\n28:38.600 --> 28:42.400\n It's a different game in the causal domain,\n\n28:42.400 --> 28:46.480\n because it's essentially the same thing.\n\n28:46.480 --> 28:48.680\n You have to start with some knowledge,\n\n28:48.680 --> 28:51.520\n and you're trying to enrich it.\n\n28:51.520 --> 28:56.460\n But you don't enrich it by asking for more rules.\n\n28:56.460 --> 28:58.960\n You enrich it by asking for the data,\n\n28:58.960 --> 29:01.800\n to look at the data and quantifying,\n\n29:01.800 --> 29:05.520\n and ask queries that you couldn't answer when you started.\n\n29:06.480 --> 29:11.480\n You couldn't because the question is quite complex,\n\n29:11.480 --> 29:16.480\n and it's not within the capability\n\n29:16.600 --> 29:19.840\n of ordinary cognition, of ordinary person,\n\n29:19.840 --> 29:22.320\n or ordinary expert even, to answer.\n\n29:23.200 --> 29:24.920\n So what kind of questions do you think\n\n29:24.920 --> 29:26.960\n we can start to answer?\n\n29:26.960 --> 29:27.800\n Even a simple one.\n\n29:27.800 --> 29:31.200\n Suppose, yeah, I'll start with easy one.\n\n29:31.200 --> 29:32.040\n Let's do it.\n\n29:32.040 --> 29:35.880\n Okay, what's the effect of a drug on recovery?\n\n29:37.520 --> 29:39.500\n What is the aspirin that caused my headache\n\n29:39.500 --> 29:44.500\n to be cured, or what did the television program,\n\n29:44.640 --> 29:46.320\n or the good news I received?\n\n29:47.680 --> 29:49.920\n This is already, you see, it's a difficult question,\n\n29:49.920 --> 29:52.840\n because it's find the cause from effect.\n\n29:53.680 --> 29:55.880\n The easy one is find the effect from cause.\n\n29:56.760 --> 29:57.720\n That's right.\n\n29:57.720 --> 29:59.180\n So first you construct a model,\n\n29:59.180 --> 30:01.280\n saying that this is an important research question.\n\n30:01.280 --> 30:02.840\n This is an important question.\n\n30:02.840 --> 30:04.320\n Then you do.\n\n30:04.320 --> 30:05.520\n I didn't construct a model yet.\n\n30:05.520 --> 30:07.680\n I just said it's an important question.\n\n30:07.680 --> 30:12.280\n And the first exercise is express it mathematically.\n\n30:12.280 --> 30:13.800\n What do you want to do?\n\n30:13.800 --> 30:17.000\n Like, if I tell you what will be the effect\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:21.320\n of taking this drug, you have to say that in mathematics.\n\n30:21.320 --> 30:22.880\n How do you say that?\n\n30:22.880 --> 30:23.720\n Yes.\n\n30:23.720 --> 30:26.400\n Can you write down the question, not the answer?\n\n30:27.720 --> 30:32.420\n I want to find the effect of the drug on my headache.\n\n30:32.420 --> 30:33.260\n Right.\n\n30:33.260 --> 30:34.680\n Write down, write it down.\n\n30:34.680 --> 30:35.920\n That's where the do calculus comes in.\n\n30:35.920 --> 30:36.760\n Yes.\n\n30:36.760 --> 30:38.240\n The do operator, what is the do operator?\n\n30:38.240 --> 30:40.080\n Do operator, yeah.\n\n30:40.080 --> 30:40.920\n Which is nice.\n\n30:40.920 --> 30:43.280\n It's the difference in association and intervention.\n\n30:43.280 --> 30:45.760\n Very beautifully sort of constructed.\n\n30:45.760 --> 30:48.880\n Yeah, so we have a do operator.\n\n30:48.880 --> 30:52.560\n So the do calculus connected on the do operator itself\n\n30:52.560 --> 30:55.560\n connects the operation of doing\n\n30:55.560 --> 30:57.880\n to something that we can see.\n\n30:57.880 --> 30:58.720\n Right.\n\n30:58.720 --> 31:01.740\n So as opposed to the purely observing,\n\n31:01.740 --> 31:05.920\n you're making the choice to change a variable.\n\n31:05.920 --> 31:08.240\n That's what it expresses.\n\n31:08.240 --> 31:10.960\n And then the way that we interpret it,\n\n31:11.840 --> 31:15.400\n the mechanism by which we take your query\n\n31:15.400 --> 31:18.640\n and we translate it into something that we can work with\n\n31:18.640 --> 31:21.040\n is by giving it semantics,\n\n31:21.040 --> 31:23.320\n saying that you have a model of the world\n\n31:23.320 --> 31:26.840\n and you cut off all the incoming error into X\n\n31:26.840 --> 31:30.680\n and you're looking now in the modified mutilated model,\n\n31:30.680 --> 31:33.660\n you ask for the probability of Y.\n\n31:33.660 --> 31:36.360\n That is interpretation of doing X\n\n31:36.360 --> 31:40.240\n because by doing things, you've liberated them\n\n31:40.240 --> 31:45.200\n from all influences that acted upon them earlier\n\n31:45.200 --> 31:49.200\n and you subject them to the tyranny of your muscles.\n\n31:50.080 --> 31:54.040\n So you remove all the questions about causality\n\n31:54.040 --> 31:55.740\n by doing them.\n\n31:55.740 --> 31:56.580\n So you're now.\n\n31:56.580 --> 31:58.160\n There's one level of questions.\n\n31:58.160 --> 31:59.000\n Yeah.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.920\n Answer questions about what will happen if you do things.\n\n32:01.920 --> 32:03.320\n If you do, if you drink the coffee,\n\n32:03.320 --> 32:04.160\n if you take the aspirin.\n\n32:04.160 --> 32:05.320\n Right.\n\n32:05.320 --> 32:10.100\n So how do we get the doing data?\n\n32:11.360 --> 32:15.660\n Now the question is, if we cannot run experiments,\n\n32:16.560 --> 32:20.960\n then we have to rely on observational study.\n\n32:20.960 --> 32:22.560\n So first we could, sorry to interrupt,\n\n32:22.560 --> 32:25.880\n we could run an experiment where we do something,\n\n32:25.880 --> 32:28.200\n where we drink the coffee and this,\n\n32:28.200 --> 32:31.120\n the do operator allows you to sort of be systematic\n\n32:31.120 --> 32:31.960\n about expressing.\n\n32:31.960 --> 32:34.560\n So imagine how the experiment will look like\n\n32:34.560 --> 32:36.880\n even though we cannot physically\n\n32:36.880 --> 32:38.760\n and technologically conduct it.\n\n32:38.760 --> 32:40.600\n I'll give you an example.\n\n32:40.600 --> 32:43.680\n What is the effect of blood pressure on mortality?\n\n32:44.960 --> 32:47.360\n I cannot go down into your vein\n\n32:47.360 --> 32:49.400\n and change your blood pressure,\n\n32:49.400 --> 32:50.800\n but I can ask the question,\n\n32:52.060 --> 32:55.120\n which means I can even have a model of your body.\n\n32:55.120 --> 32:58.600\n I can imagine the effect of your,\n\n32:58.600 --> 33:03.600\n how the blood pressure change will affect your mortality.\n\n33:04.720 --> 33:05.560\n How?\n\n33:05.560 --> 33:09.760\n I go into the model and I conduct this surgery\n\n33:09.760 --> 33:12.080\n about the blood pressure,\n\n33:12.080 --> 33:15.840\n even though physically I can do, I cannot do it.\n\n33:17.200 --> 33:19.760\n Let me ask the quantum mechanics question.\n\n33:19.760 --> 33:22.240\n Does the doing change the observation?\n\n33:23.720 --> 33:28.240\n Meaning the surgery of changing the blood pressure is,\n\n33:28.240 --> 33:29.080\n I mean.\n\n33:29.080 --> 33:31.160\n No, the surgery is,\n\n33:31.160 --> 33:35.440\n I call the very delicate.\n\n33:35.440 --> 33:37.840\n It's very delicate, infinitely delicate.\n\n33:37.840 --> 33:40.760\n Incisive and delicate, which means,\n\n33:40.760 --> 33:44.720\n do means, do X means,\n\n33:44.720 --> 33:46.480\n I'm gonna touch only X.\n\n33:46.480 --> 33:47.320\n Only X.\n\n33:47.320 --> 33:48.760\n Directly into X.\n\n33:50.160 --> 33:52.800\n So that means that I change only things\n\n33:52.800 --> 33:56.800\n which depends on X by virtue of X changing,\n\n33:56.800 --> 34:00.400\n but I don't depend things which are not depend on X.\n\n34:00.400 --> 34:04.240\n Like I wouldn't change your sex or your age,\n\n34:04.240 --> 34:06.080\n I just change your blood pressure.\n\n34:06.880 --> 34:08.720\n So in the case of blood pressure,\n\n34:08.720 --> 34:11.160\n it may be difficult or impossible\n\n34:11.160 --> 34:12.800\n to construct such an experiment.\n\n34:12.800 --> 34:16.560\n No, physically yes, but hypothetically no.\n\n34:16.560 --> 34:17.400\n Hypothetically no.\n\n34:17.400 --> 34:20.720\n If we have a model, that is what the model is for.\n\n34:20.720 --> 34:24.640\n So you conduct surgeries on a model,\n\n34:24.640 --> 34:26.880\n you take it apart, put it back,\n\n34:26.880 --> 34:28.880\n that's the idea of a model.\n\n34:28.880 --> 34:31.640\n It's the idea of thinking counterfactually, imagining,\n\n34:31.640 --> 34:35.120\n and that's the idea of creativity.\n\n34:35.120 --> 34:36.400\n So by constructing that model,\n\n34:36.400 --> 34:41.400\n you can start to infer if the higher the blood pressure\n\n34:43.040 --> 34:47.320\n leads to mortality, which increases or decreases by.\n\n34:47.320 --> 34:50.800\n I construct the model, I still cannot answer it.\n\n34:50.800 --> 34:53.800\n I have to see if I have enough information in the model\n\n34:53.800 --> 34:58.360\n that would allow me to find out the effects of intervention\n\n34:58.360 --> 35:03.360\n from a noninterventional study, hence of study.\n\n35:04.520 --> 35:06.240\n So what's needed?\n\n35:06.240 --> 35:11.240\n You need to have assumptions about who affects whom.\n\n35:13.480 --> 35:16.400\n If the graph had a certain property,\n\n35:16.400 --> 35:20.560\n the answer is yes, you can get it from observational study.\n\n35:20.560 --> 35:23.760\n If the graph is too mushy, bushy, bushy,\n\n35:23.760 --> 35:25.680\n the answer is no, you cannot.\n\n35:25.680 --> 35:30.680\n Then you need to find either different kind of observation\n\n35:30.680 --> 35:34.120\n that you haven't considered, or one experiment.\n\n35:35.120 --> 35:38.880\n So basically, that puts a lot of pressure on you\n\n35:38.880 --> 35:41.920\n to encode wisdom into that graph.\n\n35:41.920 --> 35:42.960\n Correct.\n\n35:42.960 --> 35:47.520\n But you don't have to encode more than what you know.\n\n35:47.520 --> 35:49.680\n God forbid, if you put the,\n\n35:49.680 --> 35:51.400\n like economists are doing this,\n\n35:51.400 --> 35:52.880\n they call identifying assumption.\n\n35:52.880 --> 35:55.120\n They put assumptions, even if they don't prevail\n\n35:55.120 --> 35:56.840\n in the world, they put assumptions\n\n35:56.840 --> 35:59.240\n so they can identify things.\n\n35:59.240 --> 36:01.480\n But the problem is, yes, beautifully put,\n\n36:01.480 --> 36:04.440\n but the problem is you don't know what you don't know.\n\n36:04.440 --> 36:05.920\n So.\n\n36:05.920 --> 36:07.560\n You know what you don't know.\n\n36:07.560 --> 36:10.600\n Because if you don't know, you say it's possible.\n\n36:10.600 --> 36:15.600\n It's possible that X affect the traffic tomorrow.\n\n36:17.720 --> 36:18.640\n It's possible.\n\n36:18.640 --> 36:20.880\n You put down an arrow which says it's possible.\n\n36:20.880 --> 36:23.960\n Every arrow in the graph says it's possible.\n\n36:23.960 --> 36:28.000\n So there's not a significant cost to adding arrows that.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:32.240\n The more arrow you add, the less likely you are\n\n36:32.240 --> 36:36.420\n to identify things from purely observational data.\n\n36:37.680 --> 36:39.520\n So if the whole world is bushy,\n\n36:41.360 --> 36:45.400\n and everybody affect everybody else,\n\n36:45.400 --> 36:49.160\n the answer is, you can answer it ahead of time.\n\n36:49.160 --> 36:54.160\n I cannot answer my query from observational data.\n\n36:54.240 --> 36:55.680\n I have to go to experiments.\n\n36:56.640 --> 36:58.360\n So you talk about machine learning\n\n36:58.360 --> 37:01.600\n is essentially learning by association,\n\n37:01.600 --> 37:03.120\n or reasoning by association,\n\n37:03.120 --> 37:07.120\n and this do calculus is allowing for intervention.\n\n37:07.120 --> 37:07.960\n I like that word.\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:09.840\n Action.\n\n37:09.840 --> 37:12.400\n So you also talk about counterfactuals.\n\n37:12.400 --> 37:13.220\n Yeah.\n\n37:13.220 --> 37:15.880\n And trying to sort of understand the difference\n\n37:15.880 --> 37:19.360\n between counterfactuals and intervention.\n\n37:19.360 --> 37:22.320\n First of all, what is counterfactuals,\n\n37:22.320 --> 37:25.120\n and why are they useful?\n\n37:26.200 --> 37:29.700\n Why are they especially useful,\n\n37:29.700 --> 37:34.700\n as opposed to just reasoning what effect actions have?\n\n37:34.880 --> 37:37.040\n Well, counterfactual contains\n\n37:37.040 --> 37:40.280\n what we normally call explanations.\n\n37:40.280 --> 37:41.600\n Can you give an example of a counterfactual?\n\n37:41.600 --> 37:45.240\n If I tell you that acting one way affects something else,\n\n37:45.240 --> 37:46.840\n I didn't explain anything yet.\n\n37:47.720 --> 37:52.720\n But if I ask you, was it the aspirin that cured my headache?\n\n37:55.400 --> 37:58.640\n I'm asking for explanation, what cured my headache?\n\n37:58.640 --> 38:03.640\n And putting a finger on aspirin provide an explanation.\n\n38:04.640 --> 38:08.160\n It was aspirin that was responsible\n\n38:08.160 --> 38:11.560\n for your headache going away.\n\n38:11.560 --> 38:14.420\n If you didn't take the aspirin,\n\n38:14.420 --> 38:16.000\n you would still have a headache.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:20.280\n So by saying if I didn't take aspirin,\n\n38:20.280 --> 38:22.760\n I would have a headache, you're thereby saying\n\n38:22.760 --> 38:26.360\n that aspirin is the thing that removes the headache.\n\n38:26.360 --> 38:30.440\n But you have to have another important information.\n\n38:30.440 --> 38:33.680\n I took the aspirin, and my headache is gone.\n\n38:34.560 --> 38:36.400\n It's very important information.\n\n38:36.400 --> 38:38.080\n Now I'm reasoning backward,\n\n38:38.080 --> 38:40.520\n and I said, was it the aspirin?\n\n38:40.520 --> 38:42.080\n Yeah.\n\n38:42.080 --> 38:44.440\n By considering what would have happened\n\n38:44.440 --> 38:47.000\n if everything else is the same, but I didn't take aspirin.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:47.840\n That's right.\n\n38:47.840 --> 38:49.560\n So you know that things took place.\n\n38:51.040 --> 38:56.040\n Joe killed Schmoe, and Schmoe would be alive\n\n38:56.360 --> 38:59.320\n had John not used his gun.\n\n38:59.320 --> 39:02.080\n Okay, so that is the counterfactual.\n\n39:02.080 --> 39:06.640\n It had the conflict here, or clash,\n\n39:06.640 --> 39:09.600\n between observed fact,\n\n39:09.600 --> 39:13.600\n but he did shoot, okay?\n\n39:13.600 --> 39:16.600\n And the hypothetical predicate,\n\n39:16.600 --> 39:18.800\n which says had he not shot,\n\n39:18.800 --> 39:21.540\n you have a logical clash.\n\n39:21.540 --> 39:23.820\n They cannot exist together.\n\n39:23.820 --> 39:24.920\n That's the counterfactual.\n\n39:24.920 --> 39:28.280\n And that is the source of our explanation\n\n39:28.280 --> 39:33.280\n of the idea of responsibility, regret, and free will.\n\n39:34.820 --> 39:37.200\n Yeah, so it certainly seems\n\n39:37.200 --> 39:39.760\n that's the highest level of reasoning, right?\n\n39:39.760 --> 39:41.880\n Yeah, and physicists do it all the time.\n\n39:41.880 --> 39:42.760\n Who does it all the time?\n\n39:42.760 --> 39:43.580\n Physicists.\n\n39:43.580 --> 39:44.920\n Physicists.\n\n39:44.920 --> 39:47.120\n In every equation of physics,\n\n39:47.120 --> 39:49.560\n let's say you have a Hooke's law,\n\n39:49.560 --> 39:52.240\n and you put one kilogram on the spring,\n\n39:52.240 --> 39:54.680\n and the spring is one meter,\n\n39:54.680 --> 39:58.400\n and you say, had this weight been two kilogram,\n\n39:58.400 --> 40:00.400\n the spring would have been twice as long.\n\n40:02.060 --> 40:05.560\n It's no problem for physicists to say that,\n\n40:05.560 --> 40:10.240\n except that mathematics is only in the form of equation,\n\n40:10.240 --> 40:13.280\n okay, equating the weight,\n\n40:14.680 --> 40:18.520\n proportionality constant, and the length of the string.\n\n40:18.520 --> 40:22.080\n So you don't have the asymmetry\n\n40:22.080 --> 40:23.280\n in the equation of physics,\n\n40:23.280 --> 40:26.840\n although every physicist thinks counterfactually.\n\n40:26.840 --> 40:29.160\n Ask the high school kids,\n\n40:29.160 --> 40:31.120\n had the weight been three kilograms,\n\n40:31.120 --> 40:33.360\n what would be the length of the spring?\n\n40:33.360 --> 40:35.160\n They can answer it immediately,\n\n40:35.160 --> 40:38.760\n because they do the counterfactual processing in their mind,\n\n40:38.760 --> 40:41.120\n and then they put it into equation,\n\n40:41.120 --> 40:44.280\n algebraic equation, and they solve it, okay?\n\n40:44.280 --> 40:46.720\n But a robot cannot do that.\n\n40:46.720 --> 40:51.000\n How do you make a robot learn these relationships?\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.240\n Well, why you would learn?\n\n40:53.240 --> 40:55.560\n Suppose you tell him, can you do it?\n\n40:55.560 --> 40:57.520\n So before you go learning,\n\n40:57.520 --> 40:59.360\n you have to ask yourself,\n\n40:59.360 --> 41:01.820\n suppose I give you all the information, okay?\n\n41:01.820 --> 41:06.820\n Can the robot perform the task that I ask him to perform?\n\n41:07.820 --> 41:10.980\n Can he reason and say, no, it wasn't the aspirin.\n\n41:10.980 --> 41:13.320\n It was the good news you received on the phone.\n\n41:15.500 --> 41:19.620\n Right, because, well, unless the robot had a model,\n\n41:19.620 --> 41:23.620\n a causal model of the world.\n\n41:23.620 --> 41:24.740\n Right, right.\n\n41:24.740 --> 41:26.260\n I'm sorry I have to linger on this.\n\n41:26.260 --> 41:27.860\n But now we have to linger and we have to say,\n\n41:27.860 --> 41:29.100\n how do we do it?\n\n41:29.100 --> 41:29.940\n How do we build it?\n\n41:29.940 --> 41:30.760\n Yes.\n\n41:30.760 --> 41:32.180\n How do we build a causal model\n\n41:32.180 --> 41:37.180\n without a team of human experts running around?\n\n41:37.260 --> 41:39.560\n Why don't you go to learning right away?\n\n41:39.560 --> 41:41.180\n You're too much involved with learning.\n\n41:41.180 --> 41:42.100\n Because I like babies.\n\n41:42.100 --> 41:43.140\n Babies learn fast.\n\n41:43.140 --> 41:45.140\n I'm trying to figure out how they do it.\n\n41:45.140 --> 41:45.980\n Good.\n\n41:45.980 --> 41:47.660\n So that's another question.\n\n41:47.660 --> 41:50.340\n How do the babies come out with a counterfactual\n\n41:50.340 --> 41:51.760\n model of the world?\n\n41:51.760 --> 41:53.540\n And babies do that.\n\n41:53.540 --> 41:56.860\n They know how to play in the crib.\n\n41:56.860 --> 41:59.500\n They know which balls hit another one.\n\n41:59.500 --> 42:04.500\n And they learn it by playful manipulation of the world.\n\n42:06.820 --> 42:07.660\n Yes.\n\n42:07.660 --> 42:11.880\n The simple world involves only toys and balls and chimes.\n\n42:13.620 --> 42:17.260\n But if you think about it, it's a complex world.\n\n42:17.260 --> 42:20.700\n We take for granted how complicated.\n\n42:20.700 --> 42:23.740\n And kids do it by playful manipulation\n\n42:23.740 --> 42:28.740\n plus parents guidance, peer wisdom, and hearsay.\n\n42:30.860 --> 42:34.780\n They meet each other and they say,\n\n42:34.780 --> 42:38.940\n you shouldn't have taken my toy.\n\n42:38.940 --> 42:39.780\n Right.\n\n42:40.820 --> 42:43.540\n And these multiple sources of information,\n\n42:43.540 --> 42:44.900\n they're able to integrate.\n\n42:45.780 --> 42:49.260\n So the challenge is about how to integrate,\n\n42:49.260 --> 42:52.620\n how to form these causal relationships\n\n42:52.620 --> 42:54.260\n from different sources of data.\n\n42:54.260 --> 42:55.600\n Correct.\n\n42:55.600 --> 42:59.980\n So how much information is it to play,\n\n42:59.980 --> 43:03.060\n how much causal information is required\n\n43:03.060 --> 43:06.900\n to be able to play in the crib with different objects?\n\n43:06.900 --> 43:08.260\n I don't know.\n\n43:08.260 --> 43:11.340\n I haven't experimented with the crib.\n\n43:11.340 --> 43:12.700\n Okay, not a crib.\n\n43:12.700 --> 43:15.860\n Picking up, manipulating physical objects\n\n43:15.860 --> 43:19.800\n on this very, opening the pages of a book,\n\n43:19.800 --> 43:23.740\n all the tasks, the physical manipulation tasks.\n\n43:23.740 --> 43:25.260\n Do you have a sense?\n\n43:25.260 --> 43:27.980\n Because my sense is the world is extremely complicated.\n\n43:27.980 --> 43:29.420\n It's extremely complicated.\n\n43:29.420 --> 43:31.260\n I agree, and I don't know how to organize it\n\n43:31.260 --> 43:34.660\n because I've been spoiled by easy problems\n\n43:34.660 --> 43:37.240\n such as cancer and death, okay?\n\n43:37.240 --> 43:39.820\n And I'm a, but she's a.\n\n43:39.820 --> 43:41.060\n First we have to start trying to.\n\n43:41.060 --> 43:42.660\n No, but it's easy.\n\n43:42.660 --> 43:46.980\n There is in a sense that you have only 20 variables.\n\n43:46.980 --> 43:51.060\n And they are just variables and not mechanics.\n\n43:51.060 --> 43:52.300\n Okay, it's easy.\n\n43:52.300 --> 43:56.060\n You just put them on the graph and they speak to you.\n\n43:57.980 --> 44:00.540\n Yeah, and you're providing a methodology\n\n44:00.540 --> 44:02.380\n for letting them speak.\n\n44:02.380 --> 44:03.220\n Yeah.\n\n44:03.220 --> 44:05.140\n I'm working only in the abstract.\n\n44:05.140 --> 44:08.980\n The abstract was knowledge in, knowledge out,\n\n44:08.980 --> 44:10.740\n data in between.\n\n44:11.820 --> 44:15.100\n Now, can we take a leap to trying to learn\n\n44:15.100 --> 44:18.140\n in this very, when it's not 20 variables,\n\n44:18.140 --> 44:23.140\n but 20 million variables, trying to learn causation\n\n44:23.180 --> 44:24.060\n in this world?\n\n44:24.060 --> 44:27.180\n Not learn, but somehow construct models.\n\n44:27.180 --> 44:29.620\n I mean, it seems like you would only have to be able\n\n44:29.620 --> 44:33.920\n to learn because constructing it manually\n\n44:33.920 --> 44:35.580\n would be too difficult.\n\n44:35.580 --> 44:36.900\n Do you have ideas of?\n\n44:37.900 --> 44:41.220\n I think it's a matter of combining simple models\n\n44:41.220 --> 44:45.460\n from many, many sources, from many, many disciplines,\n\n44:45.460 --> 44:46.980\n and many metaphors.\n\n44:48.220 --> 44:51.940\n Metaphors are the basics of human intelligence, basis.\n\n44:51.940 --> 44:53.940\n Yeah, so how do you think of about a metaphor\n\n44:53.940 --> 44:56.180\n in terms of its use in human intelligence?\n\n44:56.180 --> 45:00.280\n Metaphors is an expert system.\n\n45:01.900 --> 45:05.700\n An expert, it's mapping problem\n\n45:05.700 --> 45:09.580\n from a problem with which you are not familiar\n\n45:09.580 --> 45:13.800\n to a problem with which you are familiar.\n\n45:13.800 --> 45:15.980\n Like, I'll give you a good example.\n\n45:15.980 --> 45:20.980\n The Greek believed that the sky is an opaque shell.\n\n45:22.240 --> 45:25.940\n It's not really infinite space.\n\n45:25.940 --> 45:29.340\n It's an opaque shell, and the stars are holes\n\n45:30.580 --> 45:32.980\n poked in the shells through which you see\n\n45:32.980 --> 45:34.260\n the eternal light.\n\n45:34.260 --> 45:35.940\n That was a metaphor.\n\n45:35.940 --> 45:36.960\n Why?\n\n45:36.960 --> 45:41.000\n Because they understand how you poke holes in the shells.\n\n45:42.800 --> 45:45.760\n They were not familiar with infinite space.\n\n45:47.260 --> 45:52.260\n And we are walking on a shell of a turtle,\n\n45:52.780 --> 45:54.520\n and if you get too close to the edge,\n\n45:54.520 --> 45:56.940\n you're gonna fall down to Hades or wherever.\n\n45:58.940 --> 45:59.900\n That's a metaphor.\n\n46:00.780 --> 46:02.180\n It's not true.\n\n46:02.180 --> 46:07.180\n But this kind of metaphor enabled Aristoteles\n\n46:07.220 --> 46:10.680\n to measure the radius of the Earth,\n\n46:10.680 --> 46:15.140\n because he said, Kamal, if we are walking on a turtle shell,\n\n46:15.140 --> 46:18.140\n then the ray of light coming to this place\n\n46:20.700 --> 46:23.040\n will be a different angle than coming to this place.\n\n46:23.040 --> 46:26.420\n I know the distance, I'll measure the two angles,\n\n46:26.420 --> 46:31.420\n and then I have the radius of the shell of the turtle.\n\n46:33.640 --> 46:38.460\n And he did, and he found his measurement\n\n46:38.460 --> 46:42.320\n very close to the measurements we have today,\n\n46:43.300 --> 46:48.300\n through the, what, 6,700 kilometers of the Earth.\n\n46:52.020 --> 46:55.060\n That's something that would not occur\n\n46:55.060 --> 46:59.760\n to Babylonian astronomer,\n\n46:59.760 --> 47:01.900\n even though the Babylonian experiment\n\n47:01.900 --> 47:04.600\n were the machine learning people of the time.\n\n47:04.600 --> 47:07.900\n They fit curves, and they could predict\n\n47:07.900 --> 47:12.220\n the eclipse of the moon much more accurately\n\n47:12.220 --> 47:14.800\n than the Greek, because they fit curve.\n\n47:17.160 --> 47:19.220\n That's a different metaphor.\n\n47:19.220 --> 47:20.580\n Something that you're familiar with,\n\n47:20.580 --> 47:21.820\n a game, a turtle shell.\n\n47:21.820 --> 47:22.660\n Okay?\n\n47:24.380 --> 47:27.520\n What does it mean if you are familiar?\n\n47:27.520 --> 47:31.900\n Familiar means that answers to certain questions\n\n47:31.900 --> 47:33.460\n are explicit.\n\n47:33.460 --> 47:35.580\n You don't have to derive them.\n\n47:35.580 --> 47:39.700\n And they were made explicit because somewhere in the past\n\n47:39.700 --> 47:42.400\n you've constructed a model of that.\n\n47:43.540 --> 47:44.940\n Yeah, you're familiar with,\n\n47:44.940 --> 47:48.340\n so the child is familiar with billiard balls.\n\n47:48.340 --> 47:51.420\n So the child could predict that if you let loose\n\n47:51.420 --> 47:54.180\n of one ball, the other one will bounce off.\n\n47:55.740 --> 48:00.180\n You obtain that by familiarity.\n\n48:00.180 --> 48:02.920\n Familiarity is answering questions,\n\n48:02.920 --> 48:05.880\n and you store the answer explicitly.\n\n48:05.880 --> 48:08.020\n You don't have to derive them.\n\n48:08.020 --> 48:09.620\n So this is the idea of a metaphor.\n\n48:09.620 --> 48:11.620\n All our life, all our intelligence\n\n48:11.620 --> 48:13.420\n is built around metaphors,\n\n48:13.420 --> 48:16.220\n mapping from the unfamiliar to the familiar.\n\n48:16.220 --> 48:20.540\n But the marriage between the two is a tough thing,\n\n48:20.540 --> 48:24.740\n which we haven't yet been able to algorithmatize.\n\n48:24.740 --> 48:29.300\n So you think of that process of using metaphor\n\n48:29.300 --> 48:31.180\n to leap from one place to another,\n\n48:31.900 --> 48:33.540\n we can call it reasoning?\n\n48:34.540 --> 48:35.900\n Is it a kind of reasoning?\n\n48:35.900 --> 48:39.500\n It is reasoning by metaphor, metaphorical reasoning.\n\n48:39.500 --> 48:43.060\n Do you think of that as learning?\n\n48:44.220 --> 48:46.500\n So learning is a popular terminology today\n\n48:46.500 --> 48:47.620\n in a narrow sense.\n\n48:47.620 --> 48:49.780\n It is, it is, it is definitely a form.\n\n48:49.780 --> 48:51.620\n So you may not, okay, right.\n\n48:51.620 --> 48:53.780\n It's one of the most important learnings,\n\n48:53.780 --> 48:57.620\n taking something which theoretically is derivable\n\n48:57.620 --> 49:01.700\n and store it in accessible format.\n\n49:01.700 --> 49:05.580\n I'll give you an example, chess, okay?\n\n49:07.780 --> 49:12.780\n Finding the winning starting move in chess is hard.\n\n49:12.780 --> 49:17.780\n It is hard, but there is an answer.\n\n49:21.260 --> 49:23.780\n Either there is a winning move for white\n\n49:23.780 --> 49:26.820\n or there isn't, or there is a draw, okay?\n\n49:26.820 --> 49:30.260\n So it is, the answer to that\n\n49:30.260 --> 49:33.700\n is available through the rule of the games.\n\n49:33.700 --> 49:35.460\n But we don't know the answer.\n\n49:35.460 --> 49:38.500\n So what does a chess master have that we don't have?\n\n49:38.500 --> 49:41.780\n He has stored explicitly an evaluation\n\n49:41.780 --> 49:45.340\n of certain complex pattern of the board.\n\n49:45.340 --> 49:46.180\n We don't have it.\n\n49:46.180 --> 49:50.020\n Ordinary people like me, I don't know about you,\n\n49:50.940 --> 49:52.820\n I'm not a chess master.\n\n49:52.820 --> 49:57.820\n So for me, I have to derive things that for him is explicit.\n\n49:58.620 --> 50:02.500\n He has seen it before, or he has seen the pattern before,\n\n50:02.500 --> 50:05.100\n or similar pattern, you see metaphor, yeah?\n\n50:05.100 --> 50:12.100\n And he generalize and said, don't move, it's a dangerous move.\n\n50:13.460 --> 50:15.540\n It's just that not in the game of chess,\n\n50:15.540 --> 50:18.940\n but in the game of billiard balls,\n\n50:18.940 --> 50:22.420\n we humans are able to initially derive very effectively\n\n50:22.420 --> 50:25.100\n and then reason by metaphor very effectively\n\n50:25.100 --> 50:28.700\n and make it look so easy that it makes one wonder\n\n50:28.700 --> 50:31.260\n how hard is it to build it in a machine.\n\n50:31.260 --> 50:36.260\n So in your sense, how far away are we\n\n50:38.260 --> 50:40.660\n to be able to construct?\n\n50:40.660 --> 50:42.780\n I don't know, I'm not a futurist.\n\n50:42.780 --> 50:47.780\n All I can tell you is that we are making tremendous progress\n\n50:48.380 --> 50:51.260\n in the causal reasoning domain.\n\n50:52.100 --> 50:57.100\n Something that I even dare to call it revolution,\n\n50:57.100 --> 51:02.100\n the code of revolution, because what we have achieved\n\n51:02.780 --> 51:07.780\n in the past three decades is something that dwarf\n\n51:09.660 --> 51:13.660\n everything that was derived in the entire history.\n\n51:13.660 --> 51:15.860\n So there's an excitement about\n\n51:15.860 --> 51:18.700\n current machine learning methodologies,\n\n51:18.700 --> 51:22.100\n and there's really important good work you're doing\n\n51:22.100 --> 51:24.620\n in causal inference.\n\n51:24.620 --> 51:29.620\n Where does the future, where do these worlds collide\n\n51:32.980 --> 51:35.060\n and what does that look like?\n\n51:35.060 --> 51:37.780\n First, they're gonna work without collision.\n\n51:37.780 --> 51:40.580\n It's gonna work in harmony.\n\n51:40.580 --> 51:41.740\n Harmony, it's not collision.\n\n51:41.740 --> 51:46.740\n The human is going to jumpstart the exercise\n\n51:46.740 --> 51:53.740\n by providing qualitative, noncommitting models\n\n51:55.060 --> 52:00.060\n of how the universe works, how in reality\n\n52:00.300 --> 52:03.780\n the domain of discourse works.\n\n52:03.780 --> 52:06.820\n The machine is gonna take over from that point of view\n\n52:06.820 --> 52:11.820\n and derive whatever the calculus says can be derived.\n\n52:11.820 --> 52:15.100\n Namely, quantitative answer to our questions.\n\n52:15.100 --> 52:18.420\n Now, these are complex questions.\n\n52:18.420 --> 52:21.220\n I'll give you some example of complex questions\n\n52:21.220 --> 52:26.220\n that will bug your mind if you think about it.\n\n52:27.580 --> 52:32.580\n You take result of studies in diverse population\n\n52:33.660 --> 52:38.660\n under diverse condition, and you infer the cause effect\n\n52:38.660 --> 52:43.140\n of a new population which doesn't even resemble\n\n52:43.140 --> 52:48.140\n any of the ones studied, and you do that by do calculus.\n\n52:48.300 --> 52:52.660\n You do that by generalizing from one study to another.\n\n52:52.660 --> 52:54.940\n See, what's common with Berto?\n\n52:54.940 --> 52:57.020\n What is different?\n\n52:57.020 --> 53:01.180\n Let's ignore the differences and pull out the commonality,\n\n53:01.180 --> 53:06.140\n and you do it over maybe 100 hospitals around the world.\n\n53:06.140 --> 53:11.140\n From that, you can get really mileage from big data.\n\n53:11.140 --> 53:15.060\n It's not only that you have many samples,\n\n53:15.060 --> 53:18.740\n you have many sources of data.\n\n53:18.740 --> 53:21.340\n So that's a really powerful thing, I think,\n\n53:21.340 --> 53:23.420\n especially for medical applications.\n\n53:23.420 --> 53:25.860\n I mean, cure cancer, right?\n\n53:25.860 --> 53:28.580\n That's how from data you can cure cancer.\n\n53:28.580 --> 53:30.100\n So we're talking about causation,\n\n53:30.100 --> 53:35.100\n which is the temporal relationships between things.\n\n53:35.180 --> 53:38.700\n Not only temporal, it's both structural and temporal.\n\n53:38.700 --> 53:43.020\n Temporal enough, temporal precedence by itself\n\n53:43.020 --> 53:45.220\n cannot replace causation.\n\n53:46.820 --> 53:50.900\n Is temporal precedence the arrow of time in physics?\n\n53:50.900 --> 53:52.220\n It's important, necessary.\n\n53:52.220 --> 53:53.060\n It's important.\n\n53:53.060 --> 53:54.260\n It's efficient, yes.\n\n53:54.260 --> 53:55.780\n Is it?\n\n53:55.780 --> 54:00.220\n Yes, I never seen cause propagate backward.\n\n54:00.220 --> 54:03.940\n But if we use the word cause,\n\n54:03.940 --> 54:07.060\n but there's relationships that are timeless.\n\n54:07.060 --> 54:10.380\n I suppose that's still forward in the arrow of time.\n\n54:10.380 --> 54:14.860\n But are there relationships, logical relationships,\n\n54:14.860 --> 54:17.140\n that fit into the structure?\n\n54:18.580 --> 54:21.980\n Sure, the whole do calculus is logical relationship.\n\n54:21.980 --> 54:23.780\n That doesn't require a temporal.\n\n54:23.780 --> 54:25.540\n It has just the condition that\n\n54:26.940 --> 54:28.580\n you're not traveling back in time.\n\n54:28.580 --> 54:31.180\n Yes, correct.\n\n54:31.180 --> 54:34.020\n So it's really a generalization of,\n\n54:34.020 --> 54:39.020\n a powerful generalization of what?\n\n54:39.740 --> 54:40.700\n Of Boolean logic.\n\n54:40.700 --> 54:41.700\n Yeah, Boolean logic.\n\n54:41.700 --> 54:42.540\n Yes.\n\n54:43.460 --> 54:46.260\n That is sort of simply put,\n\n54:46.260 --> 54:51.260\n and allows us to reason about the order of events,\n\n54:53.620 --> 54:54.460\n the source, the.\n\n54:54.460 --> 54:58.020\n Not about, between, we're not deriving the order of events.\n\n54:58.020 --> 55:01.340\n We are given cause effects relationship, okay?\n\n55:01.340 --> 55:06.340\n They ought to be obeying the time presidents relationship.\n\n55:08.900 --> 55:09.940\n We are given it.\n\n55:09.940 --> 55:12.500\n And now that we ask questions about\n\n55:12.500 --> 55:14.260\n other causes of relationship,\n\n55:14.260 --> 55:17.860\n that could be derived from the initial ones,\n\n55:17.860 --> 55:19.980\n but were not given to us explicitly.\n\n55:20.940 --> 55:25.940\n Like the case of the firing squad I gave you\n\n55:26.260 --> 55:28.220\n in the first chapter.\n\n55:28.220 --> 55:33.220\n And I ask, what if rifleman A declined to shoot?\n\n55:33.860 --> 55:36.100\n Would the prisoner still be dead?\n\n55:37.940 --> 55:42.020\n To decline to shoot, it means that he disobey order.\n\n55:42.020 --> 55:46.700\n And the rule of the games were that he is a\n\n55:48.180 --> 55:51.820\n obedient marksman, okay?\n\n55:51.820 --> 55:52.660\n That's how you start.\n\n55:52.660 --> 55:53.500\n That's the initial order.\n\n55:53.500 --> 55:56.540\n But now you ask question about breaking the rules.\n\n55:56.540 --> 56:00.420\n What if he decided not to pull the trigger?\n\n56:00.420 --> 56:02.140\n He just became a pacifist.\n\n56:03.620 --> 56:06.020\n And you and I can answer that.\n\n56:06.020 --> 56:09.220\n The other rifleman would have killed him, okay?\n\n56:09.220 --> 56:10.740\n I want the machine to do that.\n\n56:12.300 --> 56:15.420\n Is it so hard to ask a machine to do that?\n\n56:15.420 --> 56:16.740\n It's such a simple task.\n\n56:16.740 --> 56:19.380\n You have to have a calculus for that.\n\n56:19.380 --> 56:21.180\n Yes, yeah.\n\n56:21.180 --> 56:24.300\n But the curiosity, the natural curiosity for me is\n\n56:24.300 --> 56:27.980\n that yes, you're absolutely correct and important.\n\n56:27.980 --> 56:31.060\n And it's hard to believe that we haven't done this\n\n56:31.060 --> 56:35.380\n seriously extensively already a long time ago.\n\n56:35.380 --> 56:37.020\n So this is really important work.\n\n56:37.020 --> 56:41.340\n But I also wanna know, maybe you can philosophize\n\n56:41.340 --> 56:43.340\n about how hard is it to learn.\n\n56:43.340 --> 56:44.420\n Okay, let's assume we're learning.\n\n56:44.420 --> 56:45.620\n We wanna learn it, okay?\n\n56:45.620 --> 56:46.460\n We wanna learn.\n\n56:46.460 --> 56:47.280\n So what do we do?\n\n56:47.280 --> 56:51.980\n We put a learning machine that watches execution trials\n\n56:51.980 --> 56:56.980\n in many countries and many locations, okay?\n\n56:57.220 --> 57:01.040\n All the machine can learn is to see shut or not shut.\n\n57:01.040 --> 57:02.920\n Dead, not dead.\n\n57:02.920 --> 57:05.620\n A court issued an order or didn't, okay?\n\n57:05.620 --> 57:07.340\n Just the facts.\n\n57:07.340 --> 57:10.140\n For the fact you don't know who listens to whom.\n\n57:10.140 --> 57:13.740\n You don't know that the condemned person\n\n57:13.740 --> 57:15.280\n listened to the bullets,\n\n57:15.280 --> 57:19.300\n that the bullets are listening to the captain, okay?\n\n57:19.300 --> 57:24.300\n All we hear is one command, two shots, dead, okay?\n\n57:24.300 --> 57:27.100\n A triple of variable.\n\n57:27.100 --> 57:29.300\n Yes, no, yes, no.\n\n57:29.300 --> 57:32.140\n Okay, that you can learn who listens to whom\n\n57:32.140 --> 57:33.980\n and you can answer the question, no.\n\n57:33.980 --> 57:35.220\n Definitively no.\n\n57:35.220 --> 57:39.120\n But don't you think you can start proposing ideas\n\n57:39.120 --> 57:40.460\n for humans to review?\n\n57:41.660 --> 57:44.380\n You want machine to learn, you want a robot.\n\n57:44.380 --> 57:49.380\n So robot is watching trials like that, 200 trials,\n\n57:50.780 --> 57:52.580\n and then he has to answer the question,\n\n57:52.580 --> 57:56.920\n what if rifleman A refrain from shooting?\n\n57:56.920 --> 57:57.760\n Yeah.\n\n57:58.660 --> 58:00.260\n How do I do that?\n\n58:00.260 --> 58:03.620\n That's exactly my point.\n\n58:03.620 --> 58:04.900\n It's looking at the facts,\n\n58:04.900 --> 58:07.140\n don't give you the strings behind the facts.\n\n58:07.140 --> 58:11.860\n Absolutely, but do you think of machine learning\n\n58:11.860 --> 58:15.220\n as it's currently defined as only something\n\n58:15.220 --> 58:17.620\n that looks at the facts and tries to do?\n\n58:17.620 --> 58:19.180\n Right now, they only look at the facts, yeah.\n\n58:19.180 --> 58:23.500\n So is there a way to modify, in your sense?\n\n58:23.500 --> 58:25.140\n Playful manipulation.\n\n58:25.140 --> 58:26.140\n Playful manipulation.\n\n58:26.140 --> 58:26.980\n Yes, once in a while.\n\n58:26.980 --> 58:29.700\n Doing the interventionist kind of thing, intervention.\n\n58:29.700 --> 58:31.140\n But it could be at random.\n\n58:31.140 --> 58:34.540\n For instance, the rifleman is sick that day\n\n58:34.540 --> 58:37.260\n or he just vomits or whatever.\n\n58:37.260 --> 58:41.240\n So machine can observe this unexpected event\n\n58:41.240 --> 58:43.580\n which introduce noise.\n\n58:43.580 --> 58:46.420\n The noise still have to be random\n\n58:46.420 --> 58:51.420\n to be able to relate it to randomized experiment.\n\n58:51.660 --> 58:55.460\n And then you have observational studies\n\n58:55.460 --> 58:59.940\n from which to infer the strings behind the facts.\n\n58:59.940 --> 59:02.980\n It's doable to a certain extent.\n\n59:02.980 --> 59:06.260\n But now that we are expert in what you can do\n\n59:06.260 --> 59:09.080\n once you have a model, we can reason back and say,\n\n59:09.080 --> 59:13.020\n what kind of data you need to build a model.\n\n59:13.020 --> 59:17.300\n Got it, so I know you're not a futurist,\n\n59:17.300 --> 59:19.760\n but are you excited?\n\n59:19.760 --> 59:22.500\n Have you, when you look back at your life,\n\n59:22.500 --> 59:24.540\n longed for the idea of creating\n\n59:24.540 --> 59:25.940\n a human level intelligence system?\n\n59:25.940 --> 59:28.340\n Yeah, I'm driven by that.\n\n59:28.340 --> 59:30.500\n All my life, I'm driven just by one thing.\n\n59:33.780 --> 59:34.900\n But I go slowly.\n\n59:34.900 --> 59:39.380\n I go from what I know to the next step incrementally.\n\n59:39.380 --> 59:42.440\n So without imagining what the end goal looks like.\n\n59:42.440 --> 59:44.860\n Do you imagine what an eight?\n\n59:44.860 --> 59:47.780\n The end goal is gonna be a machine\n\n59:47.780 --> 59:50.900\n that can answer sophisticated questions,\n\n59:50.900 --> 59:53.860\n counterfactuals of regret, compassion,\n\n59:55.500 --> 59:57.840\n responsibility, and free will.\n\n59:59.380 --> 1:00:01.620\n So what is a good test?\n\n1:00:01.620 --> 1:00:04.980\n Is a Turing test a reasonable test?\n\n1:00:04.980 --> 1:00:06.780\n A test of free will doesn't exist yet.\n\n1:00:08.380 --> 1:00:09.940\n How would you test free will?\n\n1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:12.540\n So far, we know only one thing.\n\n1:00:14.940 --> 1:00:19.940\n If robots can communicate with reward and punishment\n\n1:00:20.500 --> 1:00:25.420\n among themselves and hitting each other on the wrist\n\n1:00:25.420 --> 1:00:27.820\n and say, you shouldn't have done that, okay?\n\n1:00:27.820 --> 1:00:32.260\n Playing better soccer because they can do that.\n\n1:00:33.900 --> 1:00:35.940\n What do you mean, because they can do that?\n\n1:00:35.940 --> 1:00:38.100\n Because they can communicate among themselves.\n\n1:00:38.100 --> 1:00:40.100\n Because of the communication they can do.\n\n1:00:40.100 --> 1:00:42.660\n Because they communicate like us.\n\n1:00:42.660 --> 1:00:44.580\n Reward and punishment, yes.\n\n1:00:44.580 --> 1:00:47.580\n You didn't pass the ball at the right time,\n\n1:00:47.580 --> 1:00:50.060\n and so therefore you're gonna sit on the bench\n\n1:00:50.060 --> 1:00:51.540\n for the next two.\n\n1:00:51.540 --> 1:00:53.660\n If they start communicating like that,\n\n1:00:53.660 --> 1:00:56.380\n the question is, will they play better soccer?\n\n1:00:56.380 --> 1:00:57.660\n As opposed to what?\n\n1:00:57.660 --> 1:00:59.660\n As opposed to what they do now?\n\n1:00:59.660 --> 1:01:04.660\n Without this ability to reason about reward and punishment.\n\n1:01:04.980 --> 1:01:06.420\n Responsibility.\n\n1:01:06.420 --> 1:01:07.940\n And?\n\n1:01:07.940 --> 1:01:08.780\n Artifactions.\n\n1:01:08.780 --> 1:01:11.700\n So far, I can only think about communication.\n\n1:01:11.700 --> 1:01:15.380\n Communication is, and not necessarily natural language,\n\n1:01:15.380 --> 1:01:16.380\n but just communication.\n\n1:01:16.380 --> 1:01:17.580\n Just communication.\n\n1:01:17.580 --> 1:01:21.980\n And that's important to have a quick and effective means\n\n1:01:21.980 --> 1:01:24.100\n of communicating knowledge.\n\n1:01:24.100 --> 1:01:26.460\n If the coach tells you you should have passed the ball,\n\n1:01:26.460 --> 1:01:28.740\n pink, he conveys so much knowledge to you\n\n1:01:28.740 --> 1:01:30.460\n as opposed to what?\n\n1:01:30.460 --> 1:01:32.540\n Go down and change your software.\n\n1:01:33.420 --> 1:01:35.300\n That's the alternative.\n\n1:01:35.300 --> 1:01:37.700\n But the coach doesn't know your software.\n\n1:01:37.700 --> 1:01:39.580\n So how can the coach tell you\n\n1:01:39.580 --> 1:01:41.540\n you should have passed the ball?\n\n1:01:41.540 --> 1:01:44.260\n But our language is very effective.\n\n1:01:44.260 --> 1:01:45.580\n You should have passed the ball.\n\n1:01:45.580 --> 1:01:47.020\n You know your software.\n\n1:01:47.020 --> 1:01:50.940\n You tweak the right module, and next time you don't do it.\n\n1:01:52.180 --> 1:01:53.620\n Now that's for playing soccer,\n\n1:01:53.620 --> 1:01:55.180\n the rules are well defined.\n\n1:01:55.180 --> 1:01:57.420\n No, no, no, no, they're not well defined.\n\n1:01:57.420 --> 1:01:58.820\n When you should pass the ball.\n\n1:01:58.820 --> 1:02:00.020\n Is not well defined.\n\n1:02:00.020 --> 1:02:04.420\n No, it's very soft, very noisy.\n\n1:02:04.420 --> 1:02:06.700\n Yes, you have to do it under pressure.\n\n1:02:06.700 --> 1:02:07.820\n It's art.\n\n1:02:07.820 --> 1:02:11.340\n But in terms of aligning values\n\n1:02:11.340 --> 1:02:14.340\n between computers and humans,\n\n1:02:15.260 --> 1:02:20.220\n do you think this cause and effect type of thinking\n\n1:02:20.220 --> 1:02:22.300\n is important to align the values,\n\n1:02:22.300 --> 1:02:25.540\n values, morals, ethics under which the machines\n\n1:02:25.540 --> 1:02:28.500\n make decisions, is the cause effect\n\n1:02:28.500 --> 1:02:32.100\n where the two can come together?\n\n1:02:32.100 --> 1:02:34.780\n Cause and effect is necessary component\n\n1:02:34.780 --> 1:02:38.300\n to build an ethical machine.\n\n1:02:38.300 --> 1:02:40.460\n Because the machine has to empathize\n\n1:02:40.460 --> 1:02:42.660\n to understand what's good for you,\n\n1:02:42.660 --> 1:02:47.180\n to build a model of you as a recipient,\n\n1:02:47.180 --> 1:02:50.900\n which should be very much, what is compassion?\n\n1:02:50.900 --> 1:02:55.900\n They imagine that you suffer pain as much as me.\n\n1:02:56.020 --> 1:02:57.020\n As much as me.\n\n1:02:57.020 --> 1:03:00.300\n I do have already a model of myself, right?\n\n1:03:00.300 --> 1:03:02.780\n So it's very easy for me to map you to mine.\n\n1:03:02.780 --> 1:03:04.620\n I don't have to rebuild the model.\n\n1:03:04.620 --> 1:03:06.940\n It's much easier to say, oh, you're like me.\n\n1:03:06.940 --> 1:03:09.620\n Okay, therefore I would not hate you.\n\n1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:12.100\n And the machine has to imagine,\n\n1:03:12.100 --> 1:03:14.540\n has to try to fake to be human essentially\n\n1:03:14.540 --> 1:03:19.420\n so you can imagine that you're like me, right?\n\n1:03:19.420 --> 1:03:21.660\n And moreover, who is me?\n\n1:03:21.660 --> 1:03:24.180\n That's the first, that's consciousness.\n\n1:03:24.180 --> 1:03:25.740\n They have a model of yourself.\n\n1:03:26.860 --> 1:03:28.100\n Where do you get this model?\n\n1:03:28.100 --> 1:03:30.980\n You look at yourself as if you are a part\n\n1:03:30.980 --> 1:03:32.380\n of the environment.\n\n1:03:32.380 --> 1:03:33.940\n If you build a model of yourself\n\n1:03:33.940 --> 1:03:36.100\n versus the environment, then you can say,\n\n1:03:36.100 --> 1:03:38.220\n I need to have a model of myself.\n\n1:03:38.220 --> 1:03:41.820\n I have abilities, I have desires and so forth, okay?\n\n1:03:41.820 --> 1:03:44.340\n I have a blueprint of myself though.\n\n1:03:44.340 --> 1:03:46.140\n Not the full detail because I cannot\n\n1:03:46.140 --> 1:03:49.220\n get the whole thing problem.\n\n1:03:49.220 --> 1:03:50.700\n But I have a blueprint.\n\n1:03:50.700 --> 1:03:54.220\n So on that level of a blueprint, I can modify things.\n\n1:03:54.220 --> 1:03:56.580\n I can look at myself in the mirror and say,\n\n1:03:56.580 --> 1:03:59.180\n hmm, if I change this model, tweak this model,\n\n1:03:59.180 --> 1:04:01.140\n I'm gonna perform differently.\n\n1:04:02.340 --> 1:04:04.340\n That is what we mean by free will.\n\n1:04:05.740 --> 1:04:06.940\n And consciousness.\n\n1:04:06.940 --> 1:04:08.260\n And consciousness.\n\n1:04:08.260 --> 1:04:10.380\n What do you think is consciousness?\n\n1:04:10.380 --> 1:04:11.820\n Is it simply self awareness?\n\n1:04:11.820 --> 1:04:14.660\n So including yourself into the model of the world?\n\n1:04:14.660 --> 1:04:15.500\n That's right.\n\n1:04:15.500 --> 1:04:19.620\n Some people tell me, no, this is only part of consciousness.\n\n1:04:19.620 --> 1:04:21.460\n And then they start telling me what they really mean\n\n1:04:21.460 --> 1:04:23.180\n by consciousness, and I lose them.\n\n1:04:24.740 --> 1:04:29.420\n For me, consciousness is having a blueprint\n\n1:04:29.420 --> 1:04:30.420\n of your software.\n\n1:04:31.580 --> 1:04:36.580\n Do you have concerns about the future of AI?\n\n1:04:37.020 --> 1:04:39.660\n All the different trajectories of all of our research?\n\n1:04:39.660 --> 1:04:40.700\n Yes.\n\n1:04:40.700 --> 1:04:43.300\n Where's your hope, where the movement has,\n\n1:04:43.300 --> 1:04:44.380\n where are your concerns?\n\n1:04:44.380 --> 1:04:49.380\n I'm concerned, because I know we are building a new species\n\n1:04:49.500 --> 1:04:54.500\n that has a capability of exceeding our, exceeding us,\n\n1:04:56.820 --> 1:05:01.300\n exceeding our capabilities, and can breed itself\n\n1:05:01.300 --> 1:05:02.540\n and take over the world.\n\n1:05:02.540 --> 1:05:03.580\n Absolutely.\n\n1:05:03.580 --> 1:05:07.660\n It's a new species that is uncontrolled.\n\n1:05:07.660 --> 1:05:10.140\n We don't know the degree to which we control it.\n\n1:05:10.140 --> 1:05:12.660\n We don't even understand what it means\n\n1:05:12.660 --> 1:05:15.180\n to be able to control this new species.\n\n1:05:16.500 --> 1:05:17.740\n So I'm concerned.\n\n1:05:18.660 --> 1:05:21.100\n I don't have anything to add to that,\n\n1:05:21.100 --> 1:05:26.100\n because it's such a gray area, it's unknown.\n\n1:05:26.100 --> 1:05:27.740\n It never happened in history.\n\n1:05:29.820 --> 1:05:34.260\n The only time it happened in history\n\n1:05:34.260 --> 1:05:35.980\n was evolution with human beings.\n\n1:05:37.580 --> 1:05:39.420\n It wasn't very successful, was it?\n\n1:05:39.420 --> 1:05:42.700\n Some people say it was a great success.\n\n1:05:42.700 --> 1:05:46.380\n For us it was, but a few people along the way,\n\n1:05:46.380 --> 1:05:49.340\n a few creatures along the way would not agree.\n\n1:05:49.340 --> 1:05:53.100\n So it's just because it's such a gray area,\n\n1:05:53.100 --> 1:05:54.980\n there's nothing else to say.\n\n1:05:54.980 --> 1:05:56.820\n We have a sample of one.\n\n1:05:56.820 --> 1:05:58.100\n Sample of one.\n\n1:05:58.100 --> 1:05:58.940\n It's us.\n\n1:05:59.860 --> 1:06:04.860\n But some people would look at you and say,\n\n1:06:04.860 --> 1:06:09.780\n yeah, but we were looking to you to help us\n\n1:06:09.780 --> 1:06:13.180\n make sure that the sample two works out okay.\n\n1:06:13.180 --> 1:06:14.860\n We have more than a sample of one.\n\n1:06:14.860 --> 1:06:18.700\n We have theories, and that's a good.\n\n1:06:18.700 --> 1:06:20.740\n We don't need to be statisticians.\n\n1:06:20.740 --> 1:06:25.420\n So sample of one doesn't mean poverty of knowledge.\n\n1:06:25.420 --> 1:06:26.460\n It's not.\n\n1:06:26.460 --> 1:06:30.540\n Sample of one plus theory, conjectural theory,\n\n1:06:30.540 --> 1:06:31.780\n of what could happen.\n\n1:06:32.940 --> 1:06:34.380\n That we do have.\n\n1:06:34.380 --> 1:06:38.260\n But I really feel helpless in contributing\n\n1:06:38.260 --> 1:06:41.980\n to this argument, because I know so little,\n\n1:06:41.980 --> 1:06:46.640\n and my imagination is limited,\n\n1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:50.140\n and I know how much I don't know,\n\n1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:54.480\n and I, but I'm concerned.\n\n1:06:55.540 --> 1:06:57.780\n You were born and raised in Israel.\n\n1:06:57.780 --> 1:06:59.260\n Born and raised in Israel, yes.\n\n1:06:59.260 --> 1:07:03.900\n And later served in Israel military,\n\n1:07:03.900 --> 1:07:05.220\n defense forces.\n\n1:07:05.220 --> 1:07:07.980\n In the Israel Defense Force.\n\n1:07:07.980 --> 1:07:08.820\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:09.720 --> 1:07:13.820\n What did you learn from that experience?\n\n1:07:13.820 --> 1:07:15.140\n From this experience?\n\n1:07:16.540 --> 1:07:18.140\n There's a kibbutz in there as well.\n\n1:07:18.140 --> 1:07:20.540\n Yes, because I was in the nachal,\n\n1:07:20.540 --> 1:07:25.540\n which is a combination of agricultural work\n\n1:07:26.140 --> 1:07:28.540\n and military service.\n\n1:07:28.540 --> 1:07:31.220\n We were supposed, I was really idealist.\n\n1:07:31.220 --> 1:07:36.180\n I wanted to be a member of the kibbutz throughout my life,\n\n1:07:36.180 --> 1:07:38.700\n and to live a communal life,\n\n1:07:38.700 --> 1:07:43.700\n and so I prepared myself for that.\n\n1:07:46.060 --> 1:07:49.980\n Slowly, slowly, I wanted a greater challenge.\n\n1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:55.340\n So that's a far world away, both.\n\n1:07:55.340 --> 1:07:57.780\n What I learned from that, what I can add,\n\n1:07:57.780 --> 1:08:00.300\n it was a miracle.\n\n1:08:01.340 --> 1:08:05.700\n It was a miracle that I served in the 1950s.\n\n1:08:07.700 --> 1:08:09.460\n I don't know how we survived.\n\n1:08:11.380 --> 1:08:13.720\n The country was under austerity.\n\n1:08:15.380 --> 1:08:20.380\n It tripled its population from 600,000 to a million point eight\n\n1:08:21.460 --> 1:08:23.320\n when I finished college.\n\n1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:24.860\n No one went hungry.\n\n1:08:24.860 --> 1:08:28.040\n And austerity, yes.\n\n1:08:29.380 --> 1:08:34.220\n When you wanted to make an omelet in a restaurant,\n\n1:08:34.220 --> 1:08:35.620\n you had to bring your own egg.\n\n1:08:38.140 --> 1:08:43.140\n And they imprisoned people from bringing the food\n\n1:08:43.740 --> 1:08:47.940\n from farming here, from the villages, to the city.\n\n1:08:49.380 --> 1:08:50.780\n But no one went hungry.\n\n1:08:50.780 --> 1:08:53.620\n And I always add to it,\n\n1:08:53.620 --> 1:08:58.620\n and higher education did not suffer any budget cut.\n\n1:09:00.220 --> 1:09:05.220\n They still invested in me, in my wife, in our generation\n\n1:09:05.460 --> 1:09:09.700\n to get the best education that they could, okay?\n\n1:09:09.700 --> 1:09:14.700\n So I'm really grateful for the opportunity,\n\n1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:18.620\n and I'm trying to pay back now, okay?\n\n1:09:18.620 --> 1:09:22.900\n It's a miracle that we survived the war of 1948.\n\n1:09:22.900 --> 1:09:26.340\n We were so close to a second genocide.\n\n1:09:27.260 --> 1:09:29.080\n It was all planned.\n\n1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:32.180\n But we survived it by miracle,\n\n1:09:32.180 --> 1:09:33.580\n and then the second miracle\n\n1:09:33.580 --> 1:09:37.780\n that not many people talk about, the next phase.\n\n1:09:37.780 --> 1:09:40.280\n How no one went hungry,\n\n1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:43.940\n and the country managed to triple its population.\n\n1:09:43.940 --> 1:09:45.300\n You know what it means to triple?\n\n1:09:45.300 --> 1:09:50.220\n Imagine United States going from what, 350 million\n\n1:09:50.220 --> 1:09:53.860\n to a trillion, unbelievable.\n\n1:09:53.860 --> 1:09:57.020\n So it's a really tense part of the world.\n\n1:09:57.020 --> 1:09:59.060\n It's a complicated part of the world,\n\n1:09:59.060 --> 1:10:00.740\n Israel and all around.\n\n1:10:01.820 --> 1:10:06.820\n Religion is at the core of that complexity.\n\n1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:09.460\n One of the components.\n\n1:10:09.460 --> 1:10:12.420\n Religion is a strong motivating cause\n\n1:10:12.420 --> 1:10:16.500\n to many, many people in the Middle East, yes.\n\n1:10:16.500 --> 1:10:21.020\n In your view, looking back, is religion good for society?\n\n1:10:23.180 --> 1:10:25.500\n That's a good question for robotic, you know?\n\n1:10:26.900 --> 1:10:28.300\n There's echoes of that question.\n\n1:10:28.300 --> 1:10:30.980\n Equip robot with religious belief.\n\n1:10:32.260 --> 1:10:34.660\n Suppose we find out, or we agree\n\n1:10:34.660 --> 1:10:37.940\n that religion is good to you, to keep you in line, okay?\n\n1:10:37.940 --> 1:10:42.940\n Should we give the robot the metaphor of a god?\n\n1:10:43.340 --> 1:10:46.460\n As a matter of fact, the robot will get it without us also.\n\n1:10:47.340 --> 1:10:48.180\n Why?\n\n1:10:48.180 --> 1:10:51.020\n The robot will reason by metaphor.\n\n1:10:51.020 --> 1:10:56.020\n And what is the most primitive metaphor\n\n1:10:56.380 --> 1:10:57.580\n a child grows with?\n\n1:10:58.940 --> 1:11:02.940\n Mother smile, father teaching,\n\n1:11:02.940 --> 1:11:05.380\n father image and mother image, that's god.\n\n1:11:05.380 --> 1:11:08.800\n So, whether you want it or not,\n\n1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:12.560\n the robot will, well, assuming that the robot\n\n1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:14.800\n is gonna have a mother and a father,\n\n1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:16.360\n it may only have a programmer,\n\n1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:20.960\n which doesn't supply warmth and discipline.\n\n1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:22.440\n Well, discipline it does.\n\n1:11:22.440 --> 1:11:26.220\n So the robot will have a model of the trainer,\n\n1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:29.320\n and everything that happens in the world,\n\n1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:32.280\n cosmology and so on, is going to be mapped\n\n1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:36.520\n into the programmer, it's god.\n\n1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:41.380\n Man, the thing that represents the origin\n\n1:11:41.380 --> 1:11:43.960\n of everything for that robot.\n\n1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:46.340\n It's the most primitive relationship.\n\n1:11:46.340 --> 1:11:48.680\n So it's gonna arrive there by metaphor.\n\n1:11:48.680 --> 1:11:51.880\n And so the question is if overall\n\n1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:56.200\n that metaphor has served us well as humans.\n\n1:11:56.200 --> 1:11:58.000\n I really don't know.\n\n1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:01.680\n I think it did, but as long as you keep\n\n1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:03.160\n in mind it's only a metaphor.\n\n1:12:05.160 --> 1:12:10.160\n So, if you think we can, can we talk about your son?\n\n1:12:11.580 --> 1:12:13.240\n Yes, yes.\n\n1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:15.080\n Can you tell his story?\n\n1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:15.920\n His story?\n\n1:12:17.180 --> 1:12:18.020\n Daniel?\n\n1:12:18.020 --> 1:12:21.200\n His story is known, he was abducted\n\n1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:26.200\n in Pakistan by Al Qaeda driven sect,\n\n1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:31.200\n and under various pretenses.\n\n1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:35.200\n I don't even pay attention to what the pretence was.\n\n1:12:35.200 --> 1:12:39.840\n Originally they wanted to have the United States\n\n1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:46.120\n deliver some promised airplanes.\n\n1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:51.520\n It was all made up, and all these demands were bogus.\n\n1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:56.520\n Bogus, I don't know really, but eventually\n\n1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:02.000\n he was executed in front of a camera.\n\n1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:07.400\n At the core of that is hate and intolerance.\n\n1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:10.000\n At the core, yes, absolutely, yes.\n\n1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:15.000\n We don't really appreciate the depth of the hate\n\n1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:20.000\n at which billions of peoples are educated.\n\n1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:27.560\n We don't understand it.\n\n1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:31.360\n I just listened recently to what they teach you\n\n1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:32.320\n in Mogadishu.\n\n1:13:32.320 --> 1:13:37.320\n Okay, okay, when the water stopped in the tap,\n\n1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:49.360\n we knew exactly who did it, the Jews.\n\n1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:50.600\n The Jews.\n\n1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:54.020\n We didn't know how, but we knew who did it.\n\n1:13:55.280 --> 1:13:58.080\n We don't appreciate what it means to us.\n\n1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:00.440\n The depth is unbelievable.\n\n1:14:00.440 --> 1:14:04.680\n Do you think all of us are capable of evil?\n\n1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:09.840\n And the education, the indoctrination\n\n1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:10.680\n is really what creates evil.\n\n1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:12.240\n Absolutely we are capable of evil.\n\n1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:17.240\n If you're indoctrinated sufficiently long and in depth,\n\n1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:23.800\n you're capable of ISIS, you're capable of Nazism.\n\n1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:28.400\n Yes, we are, but the question is whether we,\n\n1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:32.840\n after we have gone through some Western education\n\n1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:35.680\n and we learn that everything is really relative.\n\n1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:37.680\n It is not absolute God.\n\n1:14:37.680 --> 1:14:40.120\n It's only a belief in God.\n\n1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:43.520\n Whether we are capable now of being transformed\n\n1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:47.520\n under certain circumstances to become brutal.\n\n1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:50.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:55.080\n I'm worried about it because some people say yes,\n\n1:14:55.080 --> 1:14:57.360\n given the right circumstances,\n\n1:14:57.360 --> 1:15:02.360\n given bad economical crisis,\n\n1:15:04.120 --> 1:15:06.160\n you are capable of doing it too.\n\n1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:07.240\n That worries me.\n\n1:15:08.420 --> 1:15:10.520\n I want to believe it, I'm not capable.\n\n1:15:12.200 --> 1:15:14.560\n So seven years after Daniel's death,\n\n1:15:14.560 --> 1:15:16.800\n you wrote an article at the Wall Street Journal\n\n1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:19.760\n titled Daniel Pearl and the Normalization of Evil.\n\n1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:20.580\n Yes.\n\n1:15:20.580 --> 1:15:23.040\n What was your message back then\n\n1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:27.560\n and how did it change today over the years?\n\n1:15:27.560 --> 1:15:28.840\n I lost.\n\n1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:31.840\n What was the message?\n\n1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:36.840\n The message was that we are not treating terrorism\n\n1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:40.800\n as a taboo.\n\n1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:46.840\n We are treating it as a bargaining device that is accepted.\n\n1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:51.840\n People have grievance and they go and bomb restaurants.\n\n1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.240\n It's normal.\n\n1:15:55.240 --> 1:15:58.180\n Look, you're even not surprised when I tell you that.\n\n1:15:59.600 --> 1:16:01.640\n 20 years ago you say, what?\n\n1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:04.060\n For grievance you go and blow a restaurant?\n\n1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:06.960\n Today it's becoming normalized.\n\n1:16:07.960 --> 1:16:09.820\n The banalization of evil.\n\n1:16:11.080 --> 1:16:16.080\n And we have created that to ourselves by normalizing,\n\n1:16:16.080 --> 1:16:21.080\n by making it part of political life.\n\n1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:26.800\n It's a political debate.\n\n1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:32.760\n Every terrorist yesterday becomes a freedom fighter today\n\n1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:36.600\n and tomorrow it becomes terrorist again.\n\n1:16:36.600 --> 1:16:37.680\n It's switchable.\n\n1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:42.220\n Right, and so we should call out evil when there's evil.\n\n1:16:42.220 --> 1:16:46.860\n If we don't want to be part of it.\n\n1:16:46.860 --> 1:16:47.700\n Becoming.\n\n1:16:49.020 --> 1:16:52.300\n Yeah, if we want to separate good from evil,\n\n1:16:52.300 --> 1:16:54.100\n that's one of the first things that,\n\n1:16:55.060 --> 1:16:57.540\n what was it, in the Garden of Eden,\n\n1:16:57.540 --> 1:17:02.540\n remember the first thing that God told him was,\n\n1:17:02.900 --> 1:17:07.380\n hey, you want some knowledge, here's a tree of good and evil.\n\n1:17:07.380 --> 1:17:12.260\n Yeah, so this evil touched your life personally.\n\n1:17:12.260 --> 1:17:17.260\n Does your heart have anger, sadness, or is it hope?\n\n1:17:20.300 --> 1:17:25.300\n Look, I see some beautiful people coming from Pakistan.\n\n1:17:26.140 --> 1:17:29.420\n I see beautiful people everywhere.\n\n1:17:29.420 --> 1:17:34.420\n But I see horrible propagation of evil in this country too.\n\n1:17:38.700 --> 1:17:42.780\n It shows you how populistic slogans\n\n1:17:42.780 --> 1:17:47.260\n can catch the mind of the best intellectuals.\n\n1:17:48.220 --> 1:17:50.100\n Today is Father's Day.\n\n1:17:50.100 --> 1:17:51.060\n I didn't know that.\n\n1:17:51.060 --> 1:17:56.060\n Yeah, what's a fond memory you have of Daniel?\n\n1:17:56.060 --> 1:17:58.380\n What's a fond memory you have of Daniel?\n\n1:17:58.380 --> 1:18:01.760\n Oh, very good memories, immense.\n\n1:18:02.660 --> 1:18:03.920\n He was my mentor.\n\n1:18:06.100 --> 1:18:11.100\n He had a sense of balance that I didn't have.\n\n1:18:15.340 --> 1:18:17.540\n He saw the beauty in every person.\n\n1:18:19.460 --> 1:18:22.020\n He was not as emotional as I am,\n\n1:18:22.020 --> 1:18:26.220\n the more looking things in perspective.\n\n1:18:26.220 --> 1:18:29.340\n He really liked every person.\n\n1:18:29.340 --> 1:18:33.420\n He really grew up with the idea that a foreigner\n\n1:18:34.740 --> 1:18:39.740\n is a reason for curiosity, not for fear.\n\n1:18:42.780 --> 1:18:45.280\n That one time we went in Berkeley,\n\n1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:49.220\n and a homeless came out from some dark alley,\n\n1:18:49.220 --> 1:18:51.180\n and said, hey, man, can you spare a dime?\n\n1:18:51.180 --> 1:18:54.620\n I retreated back, two feet back,\n\n1:18:54.620 --> 1:18:56.220\n and then I just hugged him and say,\n\n1:18:56.220 --> 1:18:58.420\n here's a dime, enjoy yourself.\n\n1:18:58.420 --> 1:19:03.420\n Maybe you want some money to take a bus or whatever.\n\n1:19:05.340 --> 1:19:06.580\n Where did you get it?\n\n1:19:06.580 --> 1:19:07.420\n Not from me.\n\n1:19:10.460 --> 1:19:12.400\n Do you have advice for young minds today,\n\n1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:16.200\n dreaming about creating as you have dreamt,\n\n1:19:16.200 --> 1:19:17.880\n creating intelligent systems?\n\n1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:21.380\n What is the best way to arrive at new breakthrough ideas\n\n1:19:21.380 --> 1:19:23.820\n and carry them through the fire of criticism\n\n1:19:23.820 --> 1:19:27.020\n and past conventional ideas?\n\n1:19:28.780 --> 1:19:33.720\n Ask your questions freely.\n\n1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:36.640\n Your questions are never dumb.\n\n1:19:37.660 --> 1:19:39.380\n And solve them your own way.\n\n1:19:40.700 --> 1:19:42.680\n And don't take no for an answer.\n\n1:19:42.680 --> 1:19:46.240\n Look, if they are really dumb,\n\n1:19:46.240 --> 1:19:49.880\n you will find out quickly by trying an arrow\n\n1:19:49.880 --> 1:19:52.420\n to see that they're not leading any place.\n\n1:19:52.420 --> 1:19:57.420\n But follow them and try to understand things your way.\n\n1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:01.600\n That is my advice.\n\n1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:03.980\n I don't know if it's gonna help anyone.\n\n1:20:03.980 --> 1:20:05.520\n Not as brilliantly.\n\n1:20:05.520 --> 1:20:10.520\n There is a lot of inertia in science, in academia.\n\n1:20:15.120 --> 1:20:17.460\n It is slowing down science.\n\n1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:23.320\n Yeah, those two words, your way, that's a powerful thing.\n\n1:20:23.320 --> 1:20:27.000\n It's against inertia, potentially, against the flow.\n\n1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:28.640\n Against your professor.\n\n1:20:28.640 --> 1:20:30.440\n Against your professor.\n\n1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:34.840\n I wrote the Book of Why in order to democratize\n\n1:20:34.840 --> 1:20:35.960\n common sense.\n\n1:20:38.680 --> 1:20:43.680\n In order to instill rebellious spirit in students\n\n1:20:45.460 --> 1:20:50.000\n so they wouldn't wait until the professor get things right.\n\n1:20:53.720 --> 1:20:56.640\n So you wrote the manifesto of the rebellion\n\n1:20:56.640 --> 1:20:58.360\n against the professor.\n\n1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:00.360\n Against the professor, yes.\n\n1:21:00.360 --> 1:21:02.840\n So looking back at your life of research,\n\n1:21:02.840 --> 1:21:06.200\n what ideas do you hope ripple through the next many decades?\n\n1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:09.460\n What do you hope your legacy will be?\n\n1:21:10.600 --> 1:21:13.600\n I already have a tombstone carved.\n\n1:21:19.880 --> 1:21:21.560\n Oh, boy.\n\n1:21:21.560 --> 1:21:24.840\n The fundamental law of counterfactuals.\n\n1:21:25.840 --> 1:21:29.800\n That's what, it's a simple equation.\n\n1:21:29.800 --> 1:21:34.460\n Counterfactual in terms of a model surgery.\n\n1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:37.960\n That's it, because everything follows from that.\n\n1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:45.000\n If you get that, all the rest, I can die in peace.\n\n1:21:46.600 --> 1:21:49.640\n And my student can derive all my knowledge\n\n1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:51.920\n by mathematical means.\n\n1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:53.520\n The rest follows.\n\n1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:55.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:21:55.040 --> 1:21:56.420\n Thank you so much for talking today.\n\n1:21:56.420 --> 1:21:57.260\n I really appreciate it.\n\n1:21:57.260 --> 1:22:02.260\n Thank you for being so attentive and instigating.\n\n1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:05.240\n We did it.\n\n1:22:05.240 --> 1:22:06.080\n We did it.\n\n1:22:06.080 --> 1:22:07.520\n The coffee helped.\n\n1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:11.280\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Judea Pearl.\n\n1:22:11.280 --> 1:22:14.280\n And thank you to our presenting sponsor, Cash App.\n\n1:22:14.280
