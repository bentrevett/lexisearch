Prize\n\n00:07.000 --> 00:09.620\n for the co discovery of asymptotic freedom\n\n00:09.620 --> 00:12.160\n in the theory of strong interaction.\n\n00:12.160 --> 00:14.040\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:14.040 --> 00:18.700\n the Information, NetSuite, ExpressVPN, Blinkist,\n\n00:18.700 --> 00:20.420\n and Aidsleep.\n\n00:20.420 --> 00:23.600\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:23.600 --> 00:26.900\n As a side note, let me say a word about asymptotic freedom.\n\n00:26.900 --> 00:30.000\n Protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of an atom.\n\n00:30.000 --> 00:31.800\n Strong interaction is responsible\n\n00:31.800 --> 00:34.160\n for the strong nuclear force that binds them.\n\n00:34.160 --> 00:37.700\n But strong interaction also holds together the quarks\n\n00:37.700 --> 00:40.040\n that make up the protons and neutrons.\n\n00:40.040 --> 00:43.240\n Frank Wilczek, David Gross, and David Politzer\n\n00:43.240 --> 00:45.280\n came up with a theory postulating\n\n00:45.280 --> 00:48.040\n that when quarks come really close to one another,\n\n00:48.040 --> 00:51.440\n the attraction abates and they behave like free particles.\n\n00:51.440 --> 00:54.420\n This is called asymptotic freedom.\n\n00:54.420 --> 00:57.860\n This happens at very, very high energies,\n\n00:57.860 --> 01:00.640\n which is also where all the fun is.\n\n01:00.640 --> 01:02.880\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,\n\n01:02.880 --> 01:06.540\n and here is my conversation with Frank Wilczek.\n\n01:07.600 --> 01:10.960\n What is the most beautiful idea in physics?\n\n01:10.960 --> 01:13.520\n The most beautiful idea in physics\n\n01:13.520 --> 01:18.520\n is that we can get a compact description of the world\n\n01:19.080 --> 01:22.760\n that's very precise and very full\n\n01:22.760 --> 01:26.900\n at the level of the operating system of the world.\n\n01:28.520 --> 01:32.100\n That's an extraordinary gift.\n\n01:32.100 --> 01:37.100\n And we get worried when we find discrepancies\n\n01:38.160 --> 01:41.080\n between our description of the world\n\n01:41.080 --> 01:42.800\n and what's actually observed\n\n01:43.760 --> 01:46.780\n at the level even of a part in a billion.\n\n01:46.780 --> 01:49.440\n You actually have this quote from Einstein\n\n01:49.440 --> 01:51.880\n that the most incomprehensible thing\n\n01:51.880 --> 01:54.920\n about the universe is that it is comprehensible,\n\n01:54.920 --> 01:55.760\n something like that.\n\n01:55.760 --> 01:58.320\n Yes, so that's the most beautiful surprise\n\n01:58.320 --> 02:03.320\n that I think that really was to me the most profound result\n\n02:05.160 --> 02:08.640\n of the scientific revolution of the 17th century\n\n02:08.640 --> 02:13.120\n with the shining example of Newtonian physics\n\n02:13.120 --> 02:17.320\n that you could aspire to completeness, precision,\n\n02:17.320 --> 02:20.120\n and a concise description of the world,\n\n02:20.120 --> 02:21.360\n of the operating system.\n\n02:21.360 --> 02:25.280\n And it's gotten better and better over the years\n\n02:25.280 --> 02:27.920\n and that's the continuing miracle.\n\n02:27.920 --> 02:30.880\n Now, there are a lot of beautiful sub miracles too.\n\n02:30.880 --> 02:33.600\n The form of the equations is governed\n\n02:33.600 --> 02:35.760\n by high degrees of symmetry\n\n02:35.760 --> 02:39.000\n and they have a very surprising kind\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:40.800\n of mind expanding structure,\n\n02:40.800 --> 02:42.920\n especially in quantum mechanics.\n\n02:42.920 --> 02:47.920\n But if I had to say the single most beautiful revelation\n\n02:47.920 --> 02:52.920\n is that, in fact, the world is comprehensible.\n\n02:53.640 --> 02:56.480\n Would you say that's a fact or a hope?\n\n02:56.480 --> 02:58.160\n It's a fact.\n\n02:58.160 --> 03:01.280\n We can do, you can point to things like\n\n03:02.360 --> 03:07.360\n the rise of gross national products per capita\n\n03:11.400 --> 03:14.220\n around the world as a result of the scientific revolution.\n\n03:14.220 --> 03:15.720\n You can see it all around you.\n\n03:15.720 --> 03:20.720\n And recent developments with exponential production\n\n03:21.420 --> 03:26.420\n of wealth, control of nature at a very profound level\n\n03:27.480 --> 03:31.800\n where we do things like sense tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny\n\n03:31.800 --> 03:35.560\n vibrations to tell that there are black holes\n\n03:35.560 --> 03:40.560\n colliding far away or we test laws as I alluded to\n\n03:40.560 --> 03:45.400\n whether it's part in a billion and do things\n\n03:45.400 --> 03:47.660\n in what appear on the surface\n\n03:47.660 --> 03:49.820\n to be entirely different conceptual universes.\n\n03:49.820 --> 03:52.040\n I mean, on the one hand, pencil and paper\n\n03:52.040 --> 03:55.520\n are nowadays computers that calculate abstractions\n\n03:55.520 --> 03:58.660\n and on the other hand, magnets and accelerators\n\n03:58.660 --> 04:00.840\n and detectors that look at the behavior\n\n04:00.840 --> 04:05.160\n of fundamental particles and these different universes\n\n04:05.160 --> 04:08.200\n have to agree or else we get very upset\n\n04:08.200 --> 04:12.760\n and that's an amazing thing if you think about it.\n\n04:12.760 --> 04:17.760\n And it's telling us that we do understand a lot\n\n04:18.040 --> 04:20.480\n about nature at a very profound level\n\n04:21.400 --> 04:25.520\n and there are still things we don't understand of course\n\n04:25.520 --> 04:28.940\n but as we get better and better answers\n\n04:28.940 --> 04:32.720\n and better and better ability to address difficult questions\n\n04:32.720 --> 04:35.560\n we can ask more and more ambitious questions.\n\n04:35.560 --> 04:38.320\n Well, I guess the hope part of that is because\n\n04:38.320 --> 04:40.280\n we are surrounded by mystery.\n\n04:40.280 --> 04:45.040\n So one way to say it, if you look at the growth GDP\n\n04:45.040 --> 04:47.200\n over time that we figured out quite a lot\n\n04:47.200 --> 04:50.340\n and we're able to improve the quality of life\n\n04:50.340 --> 04:53.160\n because of that and we've figured out some fundamental things\n\n04:53.160 --> 04:55.400\n about this universe but we still don't know\n\n04:55.400 --> 04:58.720\n how much mystery there is and it's also possible\n\n04:58.720 --> 05:03.360\n that there's some things that are in fact incomprehensible\n\n05:03.360 --> 05:07.400\n to both our minds and the tools of science.\n\n05:07.400 --> 05:11.600\n Like the sad thing is we may not know it\n\n05:11.600 --> 05:14.320\n because in fact they are incomprehensible\n\n05:14.320 --> 05:16.480\n and that's the open question is how much\n\n05:16.480 --> 05:18.180\n of the universe is comprehensible?\n\n05:18.180 --> 05:23.180\n If we figured out everything what's inside the black hole\n\n05:23.480 --> 05:26.760\n and everything that happened at the moment of the Big Bang\n\n05:26.760 --> 05:28.880\n does that still give us the key\n\n05:28.880 --> 05:30.740\n to understanding the human mind\n\n05:30.740 --> 05:33.880\n and the emergence of all the beautiful complexity\n\n05:33.880 --> 05:35.020\n we see around us?\n\n05:35.020 --> 05:38.120\n That's not like when I see these objects\n\n05:38.120 --> 05:41.480\n like I don't know if you've seen them like cellular automata\n\n05:41.480 --> 05:44.920\n all these kinds of objects where the from simple rules\n\n05:44.920 --> 05:48.920\n emerges complexity, it makes you wonder maybe\n\n05:48.920 --> 05:52.400\n it's not reducible to simple beautiful equations\n\n05:52.400 --> 05:54.900\n the whole thing only parts of it.\n\n05:54.900 --> 05:57.680\n That's the tension I was getting at with the hope.\n\n05:57.680 --> 06:00.240\n Well, when we say the universe is comprehensible\n\n06:00.240 --> 06:04.980\n we have to kind of draw careful distinctions\n\n06:04.980 --> 06:09.980\n about or definitions about what we mean by that.\n\n06:12.640 --> 06:15.280\n Both the universe and the kind of and the comprehensive.\n\n06:15.280 --> 06:20.280\n Exactly, right so the so in certain areas\n\n06:22.160 --> 06:27.160\n of understanding reality we've made extraordinary progress\n\n06:27.160 --> 06:32.160\n I would say in understanding fundamental physical processes\n\n06:32.560 --> 06:35.780\n and getting very precise equations that really work\n\n06:35.780 --> 06:40.560\n and allow us to do the profound sculpting of matter\n\n06:40.560 --> 06:43.280\n to make computers and iPhones and everything else\n\n06:43.280 --> 06:46.080\n and they really work and they're extraordinary productions\n\n06:48.160 --> 06:51.720\n on the other but and that's all based\n\n06:51.720 --> 06:53.120\n on the laws of quantum mechanics\n\n06:53.120 --> 06:58.120\n and they really work and they give us tremendous control\n\n06:59.760 --> 07:04.760\n of nature on the other hand as we get better answers\n\n07:04.840 --> 07:07.260\n we can also ask more ambitious questions\n\n07:07.260 --> 07:11.200\n and there are certainly things that have been observed\n\n07:11.200 --> 07:15.360\n even in what would be usually called the realm of physics\n\n07:15.360 --> 07:19.640\n that aren't understood for instance there seems to be\n\n07:19.640 --> 07:21.840\n another source of mass in the universe\n\n07:21.840 --> 07:25.120\n the so called dark matter that we don't know what it is\n\n07:25.120 --> 07:29.600\n and it's a very interesting question what it is then\n\n07:30.420 --> 07:34.040\n but also as you were alluding to there's it's one thing\n\n07:34.040 --> 07:38.040\n to know the basic equations it's another thing\n\n07:38.040 --> 07:42.280\n to be able to solve them in important cases\n\n07:42.280 --> 07:45.520\n so we run up against the limits of that\n\n07:45.520 --> 07:48.600\n in things like chemistry where we'd like to be able\n\n07:48.600 --> 07:51.280\n to design molecules and predict their behavior\n\n07:51.280 --> 07:54.480\n from the equations we think the equations could do that\n\n07:54.480 --> 07:59.480\n in principle but in practice it's very challenging\n\n07:59.880 --> 08:02.580\n to solve them in all but very simple cases\n\n08:04.280 --> 08:07.200\n and then there's the other thing which is that a lot\n\n08:07.200 --> 08:11.520\n of what we're interested in is historically conditioned\n\n08:11.520 --> 08:15.460\n it's not a matter of the fundamental equations\n\n08:15.460 --> 08:19.960\n but about what has evolved or come out\n\n08:19.960 --> 08:23.640\n of the early universe and formed into people and frogs\n\n08:23.640 --> 08:27.160\n and societies and things and the laws of physics\n\n08:27.160 --> 08:30.160\n the basic laws of physics only take you so far\n\n08:30.160 --> 08:32.680\n in that it kind of provides a foundation\n\n08:32.680 --> 08:35.760\n but doesn't really that you need entirely different concepts\n\n08:35.760 --> 08:39.780\n to deal with those kind of systems\n\n08:39.780 --> 08:44.780\n and one thing I can say about that is that the laws\n\n08:46.360 --> 08:48.920\n themselves point out their limitations\n\n08:48.920 --> 08:53.360\n that they kind of their laws for dynamical evolution\n\n08:53.360 --> 08:55.600\n so they tell you what happens if you have\n\n08:55.600 --> 08:57.540\n a certain starting point but they don't tell you\n\n08:57.540 --> 09:01.720\n what the starting point should be at least yeah\n\n09:01.720 --> 09:05.000\n and the other thing that emerges\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:09.600\n from the equations themselves is the phenomena\n\n09:09.600 --> 09:14.600\n of chaos and sensitivity to initial conditions\n\n09:14.600 --> 09:19.600\n which tells us that you have that there are intrinsic\n\n09:20.760 --> 09:24.600\n limitations on how well we can spell out the consequences\n\n09:24.600 --> 09:26.360\n of the laws if we try to apply them.\n\n09:26.360 --> 09:28.900\n It's the old apple pie if you want to what is it\n\n09:28.900 --> 09:32.520\n make an apple pie from scratch you have to build\n\n09:32.520 --> 09:34.280\n the universe or something like that.\n\n09:34.280 --> 09:37.280\n Well you're much better off starting with apples\n\n09:37.280 --> 09:39.800\n than starting with quarks let's put it that way.\n\n09:39.800 --> 09:42.320\n In your book A Beautiful Question you ask\n\n09:42.320 --> 09:44.960\n does the world embody beautiful ideas?\n\n09:44.960 --> 09:48.080\n So the book is centered around this very interesting\n\n09:48.080 --> 09:50.520\n question it's like Shakespeare you can like dig in\n\n09:50.520 --> 09:52.400\n and read into all the different interpretations\n\n09:52.400 --> 09:56.280\n of this question but at the high level what to use\n\n09:56.280 --> 09:59.520\n the connection between beauty of the world\n\n09:59.520 --> 10:02.240\n and physics of the world.\n\n10:02.240 --> 10:05.320\n In a sense we now have a lot of insight into what\n\n10:05.320 --> 10:09.260\n the laws are the form they take that allow us\n\n10:09.260 --> 10:13.080\n to understand matter in great depth and control it\n\n10:13.080 --> 10:18.080\n as we've discussed and it's an extraordinary thing\n\n10:19.460 --> 10:24.460\n how mathematically ideal those equations turn out to be.\n\n10:26.620 --> 10:31.620\n In the early days of Greek philosophy Plato had this model\n\n10:33.260 --> 10:37.020\n of atoms built out of the five perfectly symmetrical\n\n10:37.020 --> 10:39.480\n platonic solids so there was somehow the idea\n\n10:39.480 --> 10:44.000\n that mathematical symmetry should govern the world\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:49.000\n and we've out Platoed Plato by far in modern physics\n\n10:49.040 --> 10:52.320\n because we have symmetries that are much more extensive\n\n10:52.320 --> 10:56.720\n much more powerful that turn out to be the ingredients\n\n10:56.720 --> 10:59.160\n out of which we construct our theory of the world\n\n10:59.160 --> 11:04.160\n and it works and so that's certainly beautiful.\n\n11:04.160 --> 11:09.160\n So the idea of symmetry which is a driving inspiration\n\n11:13.840 --> 11:18.800\n in much of human art especially decorative art\n\n11:18.800 --> 11:22.420\n like the Alhambra or wallpaper designs or things\n\n11:22.420 --> 11:26.680\n you see around you everywhere also turns out to be\n\n11:26.680 --> 11:30.480\n the dominant theme in modern fundamental physics\n\n11:30.480 --> 11:33.500\n symmetry and its manifestations the laws turn out\n\n11:33.500 --> 11:36.600\n to be very to have these tremendous amounts of symmetry\n\n11:36.600 --> 11:38.920\n you can change the symbols and move them around\n\n11:38.920 --> 11:42.420\n in different ways and they still have the same consequences.\n\n11:45.180 --> 11:50.180\n So that's beautiful that these concepts that humans\n\n11:59.040 --> 12:03.220\n find appealing also turn out to be the concepts\n\n12:03.220 --> 12:05.660\n that govern how the world actually works.\n\n12:07.720 --> 12:09.080\n I don't think that's an accident.\n\n12:09.080 --> 12:13.720\n I think humans were evolved to be able to interact\n\n12:13.720 --> 12:17.740\n with the world in ways that are advantageous\n\n12:17.740 --> 12:21.600\n and to learn from it and so we are naturally evolved\n\n12:21.600 --> 12:24.880\n or designed to enjoy beauty and it's a symmetry\n\n12:24.880 --> 12:29.880\n and the world has it and that's why we resonate with it.\n\n12:29.880 --> 12:33.180\n Well it's interesting that the ideas of symmetry\n\n12:33.180 --> 12:38.180\n emerge at many levels of the hierarchy of the universe.\n\n12:40.860 --> 12:44.420\n So you're talking about particles but it also is\n\n12:44.420 --> 12:47.280\n at the level of chemistry and biology\n\n12:47.280 --> 12:52.280\n and the fact that our cognitive sort of our perception\n\n12:55.060 --> 12:59.060\n system and whatever our cognition is also finds\n\n12:59.060 --> 13:02.980\n it appealing or somehow our sense of what is beautiful\n\n13:02.980 --> 13:05.180\n is grounded in this idea of symmetry\n\n13:05.180 --> 13:06.760\n or the breaking of symmetry.\n\n13:06.760 --> 13:09.540\n Symmetry is at the core of our conception of beauty\n\n13:09.540 --> 13:11.620\n whether it's the breaking or the non breaking\n\n13:11.620 --> 13:12.980\n of the symmetry.\n\n13:12.980 --> 13:16.400\n It makes you wonder why.\n\n13:17.740 --> 13:18.580\n Why?\n\n13:20.340 --> 13:23.780\n So I come from Russia and the question of Dostoevsky\n\n13:23.780 --> 13:27.020\n he has said that beauty will save the world.\n\n13:27.020 --> 13:29.540\n Maybe as a physicist you can tell me\n\n13:29.540 --> 13:31.380\n what do you think he meant by that?\n\n13:31.380 --> 13:32.980\n I don't know if it saves the world\n\n13:32.980 --> 13:35.700\n but it does turn out to be a tremendous source\n\n13:35.700 --> 13:37.500\n of insight into the world.\n\n13:37.500 --> 13:42.500\n When we investigate kind of the most fundamental\n\n13:42.840 --> 13:46.100\n interactions, things that are hard to access\n\n13:46.100 --> 13:48.460\n because they occur at very short distances\n\n13:48.460 --> 13:53.460\n between very special kinds of particles\n\n13:53.460 --> 13:58.460\n whose properties are only revealed at high energies.\n\n14:01.280 --> 14:04.000\n We don't have much to go on from everyday life\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:06.600\n but so we have when we guess what the,\n\n14:06.600 --> 14:08.640\n and the experiments are difficult to do\n\n14:08.640 --> 14:13.640\n so you can't really follow a very wholly empirical procedure\n\n14:14.760 --> 14:19.760\n to sort of in the Baconian style figure out the laws\n\n14:20.140 --> 14:23.200\n kind of step by step just by accumulating a lot of data\n\n14:23.200 --> 14:25.960\n what we actually do is guess.\n\n14:25.960 --> 14:29.440\n And the guesses are kind of aesthetic really.\n\n14:29.440 --> 14:31.540\n What would be a nice description\n\n14:31.540 --> 14:34.180\n that's consistent with what we know\n\n14:34.180 --> 14:36.320\n and then you try it out and see if it works\n\n14:36.320 --> 14:41.320\n and by gosh it does in many profound cases.\n\n14:42.800 --> 14:46.080\n So there's that but there's another source of symmetry\n\n14:46.080 --> 14:51.080\n which I didn't talk so much about in a beautiful question\n\n14:51.080 --> 14:56.080\n but does relate to your comments\n\n14:56.880 --> 15:01.880\n and I think very much relates to the source of symmetry\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:07.000\n that we find in biology and in our heads, you know,\n\n15:08.440 --> 15:13.440\n in our brain which is that, well it is discussed a bit\n\n15:15.860 --> 15:20.480\n in a beautiful question and also in fundamentals\n\n15:20.480 --> 15:25.480\n is that when you have, symmetry is also a very important\n\n15:28.240 --> 15:30.340\n means of construction.\n\n15:30.340 --> 15:34.540\n So when you have for instance simple viruses\n\n15:34.540 --> 15:39.380\n that need to construct their coat, their protein coat,\n\n15:39.380 --> 15:42.180\n the coats often take the form of platonic solids\n\n15:43.500 --> 15:47.100\n and the reason is that the viruses are really dumb\n\n15:47.100 --> 15:49.020\n and they only know how to do one thing\n\n15:49.020 --> 15:51.620\n so they make a pentagon then they make another pentagon\n\n15:51.620 --> 15:52.640\n and they make another pentagon\n\n15:52.640 --> 15:55.420\n and they all glue together in the same way\n\n15:55.420 --> 15:58.980\n and that makes a very symmetrical object sort of.\n\n15:58.980 --> 16:02.060\n So the rules of development when you have simple rules\n\n16:02.060 --> 16:07.060\n and they work again and again, you get symmetrical patterns.\n\n16:07.060 --> 16:09.740\n That's kind of, in fact it's a recipe also\n\n16:09.740 --> 16:14.740\n for generating fractals, like the kind of broccoli\n\n16:14.740 --> 16:19.300\n that has all this internal structure\n\n16:19.300 --> 16:20.740\n and I wish I had a picture to show\n\n16:20.740 --> 16:23.740\n but maybe people remember it from the supermarket\n\n16:26.660 --> 16:30.020\n and you say how did a vegetable get so intelligent\n\n16:30.020 --> 16:31.620\n to make such a beautiful object\n\n16:31.620 --> 16:33.480\n with all this fractal structure\n\n16:33.480 --> 16:35.940\n and the secret is stupidity.\n\n16:35.940 --> 16:38.560\n You just do the same thing over and over again\n\n16:38.560 --> 16:43.100\n and in our brains also, you know, we came out,\n\n16:43.100 --> 16:47.500\n we start from single cells and they reproduce\n\n16:47.500 --> 16:51.840\n and each one does basically roughly the same thing.\n\n16:54.140 --> 16:56.780\n The program evolves in time, of course,\n\n16:56.780 --> 17:01.660\n different modules get turned on and off,\n\n17:01.660 --> 17:03.460\n different regions of the genetic code\n\n17:03.460 --> 17:06.700\n get turned on and off but basically,\n\n17:06.700 --> 17:08.800\n a lot of the same things are going on\n\n17:08.800 --> 17:09.740\n and they're simple things\n\n17:09.740 --> 17:12.460\n and so you produce the same patterns over and over again\n\n17:12.460 --> 17:14.540\n and that's a recipe for producing symmetry\n\n17:14.540 --> 17:17.180\n because you're getting the same thing in many, many places\n\n17:17.180 --> 17:20.860\n and if you look at, for instance,\n\n17:20.860 --> 17:24.860\n the beautiful drawings of Roman Icahal,\n\n17:24.860 --> 17:29.220\n the great neuroanatomist who drew the structure\n\n17:29.220 --> 17:33.380\n of different organs like the hippocampus,\n\n17:33.380 --> 17:37.860\n you see it's very regular and very intricate\n\n17:37.860 --> 17:42.860\n and it's symmetry in that sense\n\n17:43.940 --> 17:46.860\n because it's many repeated units\n\n17:46.860 --> 17:49.620\n that you can take from one place to the other\n\n17:49.620 --> 17:51.860\n and see that they look more or less the same.\n\n17:51.860 --> 17:54.300\n But what you're describing, this kind of beauty\n\n17:54.300 --> 17:58.940\n that we're talking about now is a very small sample\n\n17:58.940 --> 18:01.860\n in terms of space time in a very big world\n\n18:01.860 --> 18:06.860\n in a very short, brief moment in this long history.\n\n18:08.260 --> 18:11.420\n In your book, Fundamentals, 10 Keys to Reality,\n\n18:11.420 --> 18:13.460\n I'd really recommend people read it.\n\n18:14.580 --> 18:19.580\n You say that space and time are pretty big or very big.\n\n18:20.340 --> 18:21.660\n How big are we talking about?\n\n18:21.660 --> 18:26.660\n Can you tell a brief history of space and time?\n\n18:26.660 --> 18:30.660\n It's easy to tell a brief history, but the details get very\n\n18:30.660 --> 18:33.780\n involved, of course, but one thing I'd like to say\n\n18:33.780 --> 18:37.140\n is that if you take a broad enough view,\n\n18:37.140 --> 18:38.820\n the history of the universe is simpler\n\n18:38.820 --> 18:40.660\n than the history of Sweden, say,\n\n18:40.660 --> 18:43.900\n because your standards are lower.\n\n18:45.900 --> 18:49.620\n But just to make it quantitative,\n\n18:49.620 --> 18:51.500\n I'll just give a few highlights.\n\n18:51.500 --> 18:55.500\n And it's a little bit easier to talk about time,\n\n18:55.500 --> 18:57.420\n so let's start with that.\n\n18:57.420 --> 19:00.100\n The Big Bang occurred, we think.\n\n19:00.100 --> 19:03.820\n The universe was much hotter and denser and more uniform\n\n19:03.820 --> 19:07.060\n about 13.8 billion years ago,\n\n19:07.060 --> 19:08.860\n and that's what we call the Big Bang.\n\n19:10.740 --> 19:12.540\n And it's been expanding and cooling,\n\n19:12.540 --> 19:16.100\n the matter in it has been expanding and cooling ever since.\n\n19:16.100 --> 19:20.660\n So in a real sense, the universe is 13.8 billion years old.\n\n19:20.660 --> 19:24.060\n That's a big number, kind of hard to think about.\n\n19:24.060 --> 19:26.260\n A nice way to think about it, though,\n\n19:26.260 --> 19:29.260\n is to map it onto one year.\n\n19:29.260 --> 19:32.980\n So let's say the universe just linearly mapped\n\n19:32.980 --> 19:37.620\n the time intervals from 13.8 billion years onto one year.\n\n19:37.620 --> 19:42.620\n So the Big Bang then is on January 1st at 12 a.m.\n\n19:43.980 --> 19:48.980\n And you wait for quite a long time\n\n19:49.980 --> 19:51.660\n before the dinosaurs emerge.\n\n19:51.660 --> 19:55.100\n The dinosaurs emerge on Christmas, it turns out.\n\n19:55.100 --> 19:55.940\n And...\n\n19:55.940 --> 19:57.900\n 12 months, almost 12 months later.\n\n19:57.900 --> 19:59.220\n Getting close to the end, yes.\n\n19:59.220 --> 20:01.060\n Getting close to the end.\n\n20:01.060 --> 20:05.580\n And the extinction event that let the mammals\n\n20:05.580 --> 20:08.900\n and ultimately humans inherit the Earth\n\n20:08.900 --> 20:13.540\n from the dinosaurs occurred on December 30th.\n\n20:13.540 --> 20:18.380\n And all of human history is a small part of the last day.\n\n20:18.380 --> 20:23.380\n And so, yes, so we're occupying only,\n\n20:23.380 --> 20:26.860\n and a human lifetime is a very, very infinitesimal part\n\n20:26.860 --> 20:31.860\n of this interval of these gigantic cosmic reaches of time.\n\n20:35.300 --> 20:39.300\n And in space, we can tell a very similar story.\n\n20:39.300 --> 20:44.300\n In fact, it's convenient to think that the size\n\n20:44.300 --> 20:48.820\n of the universe is the distance that light can travel\n\n20:48.820 --> 20:50.700\n in 13.8 billion years.\n\n20:50.700 --> 20:54.420\n So it's 13.8 billion light years.\n\n20:54.420 --> 20:56.940\n That's how far you can see out.\n\n20:56.940 --> 21:01.380\n That's how far signals can reach us.\n\n21:01.380 --> 21:06.380\n And that is a big distance.\n\n21:06.380 --> 21:13.380\n That is a big distance because compared to that, the Earth\n\n21:14.780 --> 21:18.180\n is a fraction of a light second.\n\n21:18.180 --> 21:21.580\n So again, it's really, really big.\n\n21:21.580 --> 21:26.580\n And so if we wanna think about the universe\n\n21:27.020 --> 21:29.380\n as a whole in space and time,\n\n21:30.420 --> 21:35.060\n we really need a different kind of imagination.\n\n21:35.060 --> 21:38.860\n It's not something you can grasp\n\n21:41.900 --> 21:44.380\n in terms of psychological time in a useful way.\n\n21:44.380 --> 21:47.460\n You have to think, you have to use exponential notation\n\n21:47.460 --> 21:51.820\n and abstract concepts to really get any hold\n\n21:51.820 --> 21:54.980\n on these vast times and spaces.\n\n21:56.340 --> 21:58.140\n On the other hand, let me hasten to add\n\n21:58.140 --> 22:00.460\n that that doesn't make us small\n\n22:00.460 --> 22:05.460\n or make the time that we have to us small.\n\n22:06.900 --> 22:10.660\n Because again, looking at those pictures\n\n22:10.660 --> 22:15.500\n of what our minds are and some of the components\n\n22:15.500 --> 22:18.620\n of our minds, these beautiful drawings\n\n22:18.620 --> 22:21.180\n of the cellular patterns inside the brain,\n\n22:21.180 --> 22:24.820\n you see that there are many, many, many processing units.\n\n22:24.820 --> 22:29.740\n And if you analyze how fast they operate,\n\n22:29.740 --> 22:31.660\n I tried to estimate how many thoughts\n\n22:31.660 --> 22:33.340\n a person can have in a lifetime.\n\n22:33.340 --> 22:34.740\n That's kind of a fuzzy question,\n\n22:34.740 --> 22:36.740\n but I'm very proud that I was able\n\n22:36.740 --> 22:39.460\n to define it pretty precisely.\n\n22:39.460 --> 22:43.620\n And it turns out we have time for billions\n\n22:43.620 --> 22:46.940\n of meaningful thoughts in a lifetime.\n\n22:46.940 --> 22:48.540\n So it's a lot.\n\n22:48.540 --> 22:51.820\n We shouldn't think of ourselves as terribly small\n\n22:51.820 --> 22:53.300\n either in space or in time,\n\n22:53.300 --> 22:57.460\n because although we're small in those dimensions\n\n22:57.460 --> 23:01.380\n compared to the universe, we're large compared\n\n23:01.380 --> 23:05.980\n to meaningful units of processing information\n\n23:05.980 --> 23:10.200\n and being able to conceptualize and understand things.\n\n23:11.620 --> 23:15.100\n Yeah, but 99% of those thoughts are probably food,\n\n23:15.100 --> 23:16.820\n sex, or internet related.\n\n23:16.820 --> 23:20.540\n Well, yeah, well, they're not necessarily, that's right.\n\n23:20.540 --> 23:24.100\n Only like point one is Nobel Prize winning ideas.\n\n23:24.100 --> 23:26.340\n That's true, but there's more to life\n\n23:26.340 --> 23:27.740\n than winning Nobel Prizes.\n\n23:27.740 --> 23:29.860\n How did you do that calculate?\n\n23:29.860 --> 23:31.380\n Can you maybe break that apart a little bit,\n\n23:31.380 --> 23:34.020\n just kind of for fun, sort of an intuition\n\n23:34.020 --> 23:35.940\n of how we calculate the number of thoughts?\n\n23:35.940 --> 23:37.900\n The number of thoughts, right.\n\n23:37.900 --> 23:40.940\n It's necessarily imprecise because a lot of things\n\n23:40.940 --> 23:43.260\n are going on in different ways and what is a thought.\n\n23:43.260 --> 23:45.900\n But there are several things that point\n\n23:45.900 --> 23:50.900\n to more or less the same rate of being able\n\n23:50.900 --> 23:52.700\n to have meaningful thoughts.\n\n23:52.700 --> 23:57.700\n For instance, the one that I think is maybe\n\n23:57.700 --> 24:01.420\n the most penetrating is how fast\n\n24:01.420 --> 24:04.420\n we can process visual images.\n\n24:04.420 --> 24:05.720\n How do we do that?\n\n24:07.820 --> 24:11.380\n If you've ever watched old movies,\n\n24:11.380 --> 24:15.700\n you can see that, well, any movie, in fact,\n\n24:15.700 --> 24:18.080\n a motion picture is really not a motion picture.\n\n24:18.080 --> 24:20.540\n It's a series of snapshots that are playing\n\n24:20.540 --> 24:25.120\n one after the other and it's because our brains\n\n24:25.120 --> 24:26.540\n also work that way.\n\n24:26.540 --> 24:29.940\n We take snapshots of the world, integrate over a certain time\n\n24:29.940 --> 24:33.500\n and then go on to the next one and then by post processing,\n\n24:33.500 --> 24:37.020\n create the illusion of continuity and flow,\n\n24:37.020 --> 24:38.380\n we can deal with that.\n\n24:38.380 --> 24:43.380\n And if the flicker rate is too slow,\n\n24:44.540 --> 24:48.640\n then you start to see that it's a series of snapshots\n\n24:48.640 --> 24:51.060\n and you can ask, what is the crossover?\n\n24:51.060 --> 24:53.100\n When does it change from being something\n\n24:53.100 --> 24:57.440\n that is matched to our processing speed versus too fast?\n\n24:57.440 --> 25:00.460\n And it turns out about 40 per second.\n\n25:00.460 --> 25:04.820\n And then if you take 40 per second as how well,\n\n25:04.820 --> 25:06.900\n how fast we can process visual images,\n\n25:06.900 --> 25:09.460\n you get to several billions of thoughts.\n\n25:10.820 --> 25:14.700\n If you, similarly, if you ask what are some\n\n25:14.700 --> 25:16.980\n of the fastest things that people can do?\n\n25:16.980 --> 25:18.700\n Well, they can play video games,\n\n25:18.700 --> 25:22.500\n they can play the piano very fast if they're skilled at it.\n\n25:22.500 --> 25:25.320\n And again, you get to similar units\n\n25:25.320 --> 25:27.260\n or how fast can people talk?\n\n25:27.260 --> 25:28.420\n You get to similar, you know,\n\n25:28.420 --> 25:30.140\n within a couple of orders of magnitude,\n\n25:30.140 --> 25:33.020\n you get more or less to the same idea.\n\n25:33.020 --> 25:38.020\n So that's how you can say that there's billions\n\n25:38.660 --> 25:40.780\n of meaningful, there's room for billions\n\n25:40.780 --> 25:42.140\n of meaningful thoughts.\n\n25:42.140 --> 25:47.140\n I won't argue for exactly two billion versus 1.8 billion.\n\n25:47.620 --> 25:49.100\n It's not that kind of question,\n\n25:49.100 --> 25:52.820\n but I think any estimate that's reasonable\n\n25:52.820 --> 25:57.820\n will come out within, say, 100 billion and 100 million.\n\n25:58.180 --> 25:59.880\n So it's a lot.\n\n26:01.700 --> 26:04.140\n It would be interesting to map out\n\n26:04.140 --> 26:07.300\n for an individual human being the landscape of thoughts\n\n26:07.300 --> 26:09.320\n that they've sort of traveled.\n\n26:09.320 --> 26:12.960\n If you think of thoughts as a set of trajectories,\n\n26:14.340 --> 26:16.400\n what that landscape looks like.\n\n26:16.400 --> 26:19.620\n I mean, I've been recently really thinking\n\n26:19.620 --> 26:24.620\n about this Richard Dawkins idea of memes\n\n26:24.780 --> 26:27.840\n and just all this ideas and the evolution of ideas\n\n26:27.840 --> 26:29.900\n inside of one particular human mind\n\n26:30.780 --> 26:33.740\n and how they're then changed and evolved\n\n26:33.740 --> 26:36.520\n by interaction with other human beings.\n\n26:36.520 --> 26:38.100\n It's interesting to think about.\n\n26:38.100 --> 26:41.500\n So if you think the number is billions,\n\n26:41.500 --> 26:44.340\n you think there's also social interaction.\n\n26:44.340 --> 26:48.660\n So these aren't like there's interaction\n\n26:48.660 --> 26:50.740\n in the same way you have interaction with particles.\n\n26:50.740 --> 26:53.500\n There's interaction between human thoughts\n\n26:53.500 --> 26:56.380\n that perhaps that interaction in itself\n\n26:56.380 --> 26:59.140\n is fundamental to the process of thinking.\n\n26:59.140 --> 27:01.380\n Like without social interaction,\n\n27:01.380 --> 27:04.100\n we would be like stuck, like walking in a circle.\n\n27:04.100 --> 27:07.380\n We need the perturbation of other humans\n\n27:07.380 --> 27:09.620\n to create change and evolution.\n\n27:09.620 --> 27:13.300\n Once you bring in concepts of interactions\n\n27:13.300 --> 27:15.880\n and correlations and relations,\n\n27:15.880 --> 27:19.220\n then you have what's called a combinatorial explosion\n\n27:20.260 --> 27:24.300\n that the number of possibilities expands exponentially\n\n27:24.300 --> 27:28.900\n technically with the number of things you're considering.\n\n27:28.900 --> 27:33.900\n And it can easily rapidly outstrip these billions\n\n27:34.700 --> 27:36.740\n of thoughts that we're talking about.\n\n27:36.740 --> 27:41.700\n So we definitely cannot by brute force\n\n27:41.700 --> 27:44.460\n master complex situations\n\n27:45.500 --> 27:48.920\n or think of all the possibilities in a complex situations.\n\n27:48.920 --> 27:52.500\n I mean, even something as relatively simple as chess\n\n27:53.500 --> 27:56.300\n is still something that human beings\n\n27:56.300 --> 27:57.860\n can't comprehend completely.\n\n27:57.860 --> 28:00.940\n Even the best players lose, still sometimes lose\n\n28:00.940 --> 28:05.140\n and they consistently lose to computers these days.\n\n28:05.140 --> 28:08.860\n And in computer science, there's a concept of NP complete.\n\n28:08.860 --> 28:12.260\n So large classes of problems when you scale them up\n\n28:12.260 --> 28:16.100\n beyond a few individuals become intractable.\n\n28:16.100 --> 28:21.020\n And so that in that sense, the world is inexhaustible.\n\n28:21.020 --> 28:25.920\n And that makes it beautiful that we can make any laws\n\n28:25.920 --> 28:29.660\n that generalize efficiently and well\n\n28:29.660 --> 28:32.780\n can compress all of that combinatorial complexity\n\n28:32.780 --> 28:33.980\n just like a simple rule.\n\n28:33.980 --> 28:35.380\n That in itself is beautiful.\n\n28:35.380 --> 28:36.660\n It's a happy situation.\n\n28:36.660 --> 28:41.660\n And I think that we can find general principles\n\n28:43.300 --> 28:45.780\n of sort of of the operating system\n\n28:45.780 --> 28:49.940\n that are comprehensible, simple, extremely powerful\n\n28:49.940 --> 28:52.740\n and let us control things very well\n\n28:52.740 --> 28:55.460\n and ask profound questions.\n\n28:55.460 --> 28:56.380\n And on the other hand,\n\n28:56.380 --> 28:59.100\n that the world is going to be inexhaustible.\n\n28:59.100 --> 29:03.300\n That once we start asking about relationships\n\n29:03.300 --> 29:06.940\n and how they evolve and social interactions\n\n29:06.940 --> 29:10.620\n and we'll never have a theory of everything\n\n29:10.620 --> 29:13.580\n in any meaningful sense because that.\n\n29:13.580 --> 29:16.620\n Of everything, everything, truly everything is.\n\n29:17.860 --> 29:19.940\n Can I ask you about the Big Bang?\n\n29:19.940 --> 29:23.460\n So we talked about the space and time are really big.\n\n29:24.380 --> 29:27.780\n But then, and we humans give a lot of meaning\n\n29:27.780 --> 29:32.780\n to the word space and time in our like daily lives.\n\n29:33.660 --> 29:37.300\n But then can we talk about this moment of beginning\n\n29:37.300 --> 29:39.340\n and how we're supposed to think about it?\n\n29:40.480 --> 29:42.460\n That at the moment of the Big Bang,\n\n29:42.460 --> 29:46.660\n everything was what, like infinitely small\n\n29:46.660 --> 29:48.740\n and then it just blew up?\n\n29:48.740 --> 29:49.820\n We have to be careful here\n\n29:49.820 --> 29:53.480\n because there's a common misconception\n\n29:53.480 --> 29:58.480\n that the Big Bang is like the explosion of a bomb\n\n29:58.580 --> 30:02.980\n in empty space that fills up the surrounding place.\n\n30:02.980 --> 30:03.940\n It is space.\n\n30:03.940 --> 30:05.300\n It is, yeah.\n\n30:05.300 --> 30:08.960\n As we understand it, it's the fact,\n\n30:08.960 --> 30:12.260\n it's the fact or the hypothesis,\n\n30:12.260 --> 30:14.820\n but well supported up to a point\n\n30:14.820 --> 30:19.820\n that everywhere in the whole universe,\n\n30:19.820 --> 30:23.180\n early in the history,\n\n30:24.180 --> 30:28.140\n matter came together into a very hot, very dense,\n\n30:28.140 --> 30:29.940\n if you run it backwards in time,\n\n30:29.940 --> 30:32.740\n matter comes together into a very hot, very dense\n\n30:32.740 --> 30:36.260\n and yet very homogeneous plasma\n\n30:36.260 --> 30:39.500\n of all the different kinds of elementary particles\n\n30:39.500 --> 30:41.260\n and quarks and anti quarks and gluons\n\n30:41.260 --> 30:43.340\n and photons and electrons and anti electrons,\n\n30:43.340 --> 30:45.160\n everything, all of that stuff.\n\n30:45.160 --> 30:46.940\n Like really hot.\n\n30:46.940 --> 30:49.140\n Really, really, really hot.\n\n30:49.140 --> 30:52.100\n We're talking about way, way hotter\n\n30:52.100 --> 30:53.660\n than the surface of the sun.\n\n30:56.140 --> 31:00.660\n Well, in fact, if you take the equations as they come,\n\n31:00.660 --> 31:02.940\n the prediction is that the temperature\n\n31:02.940 --> 31:04.020\n just goes to infinity,\n\n31:04.020 --> 31:06.920\n but then the equations break down.\n\n31:06.920 --> 31:10.620\n We don't really, there are various,\n\n31:10.620 --> 31:12.980\n the equations become infinity equals infinity,\n\n31:12.980 --> 31:15.120\n so they don't feel that it's called a singularity.\n\n31:15.120 --> 31:16.240\n We don't really know.\n\n31:16.240 --> 31:19.660\n This is running the equations backwards,\n\n31:19.660 --> 31:21.780\n so you can't really get a sensible idea\n\n31:21.780 --> 31:23.940\n of what happened before the Big Bang.\n\n31:23.940 --> 31:25.660\n So we need different equations\n\n31:25.660 --> 31:28.380\n to address the very earliest moments.\n\n31:31.580 --> 31:35.660\n But so things were hotter and denser.\n\n31:35.660 --> 31:40.140\n We don't really know why things started out that way.\n\n31:40.140 --> 31:43.980\n We have a lot of evidence that they did start out that way.\n\n31:43.980 --> 31:47.840\n But since most of the,\n\n31:51.180 --> 31:55.420\n we don't get to visit there and do controlled experiments.\n\n31:55.420 --> 31:59.580\n Most of the record is very, very processed\n\n31:59.580 --> 32:04.580\n and we have to use very subtle techniques\n\n32:05.560 --> 32:09.500\n and powerful instruments to get information\n\n32:09.500 --> 32:11.140\n that has survived.\n\n32:11.140 --> 32:14.220\n Get closer and closer to the Big Bang.\n\n32:14.220 --> 32:16.460\n Get closer and closer to the beginning of things.\n\n32:16.460 --> 32:21.460\n And what's revealed there is that, as I said,\n\n32:22.900 --> 32:25.180\n there undoubtedly was a period\n\n32:25.180 --> 32:26.940\n when everything in the universe\n\n32:26.940 --> 32:30.900\n that we have been able to look at and understand,\n\n32:30.900 --> 32:33.420\n and that's consistent with everything,\n\n32:33.420 --> 32:41.420\n is in a condition where it was much, much hotter\n\n32:41.420 --> 32:43.020\n and much, much denser,\n\n32:44.220 --> 32:46.340\n but still obeying the laws of physics\n\n32:46.340 --> 32:48.180\n as we know them today.\n\n32:48.180 --> 32:51.100\n And then you start with that.\n\n32:51.100 --> 32:53.180\n So all the matter is in equilibrium.\n\n32:54.300 --> 32:57.960\n And then with small quantum fluctuations\n\n32:57.960 --> 32:59.460\n and run it forward,\n\n32:59.460 --> 33:04.020\n and then it produces, at least in broad strokes,\n\n33:04.020 --> 33:06.620\n the universe we see around us today.\n\n33:06.620 --> 33:09.180\n Do you think we'll ever be able to,\n\n33:09.180 --> 33:12.640\n with the tools of physics, with the way science is,\n\n33:12.640 --> 33:14.020\n with the way the human mind is,\n\n33:14.020 --> 33:17.700\n we'll ever be able to get to the moment of the Big Bang\n\n33:17.700 --> 33:21.700\n in our understanding or even the moment before the Big Bang?\n\n33:21.700 --> 33:24.700\n Can we understand what happened before the Big Bang?\n\n33:24.700 --> 33:29.700\n I'm optimistic both that we'll be able to measure more,\n\n33:31.620 --> 33:33.460\n so observe more,\n\n33:33.460 --> 33:36.640\n and that we'll be able to figure out more.\n\n33:36.640 --> 33:40.660\n So they're very, very tangible prospects\n\n33:40.660 --> 33:45.660\n for observing the extremely early universe,\n\n33:45.660 --> 33:48.540\n so even much earlier than we can observe now\n\n33:49.420 --> 33:52.220\n through looking at gravitational waves.\n\n33:52.220 --> 33:55.700\n Gravitational waves, since they interact so weakly\n\n33:55.700 --> 33:57.340\n with ordinary matter,\n\n33:58.820 --> 34:03.660\n sort of send a minimally processed signal from the Big Bang.\n\n34:03.660 --> 34:05.860\n It's a very weak signal\n\n34:05.860 --> 34:07.380\n because it's traveled a long way\n\n34:07.380 --> 34:09.460\n and diffused over long spaces,\n\n34:09.460 --> 34:13.360\n but people are gearing up to try to detect\n\n34:13.360 --> 34:15.220\n gravitational waves that could have come\n\n34:15.220 --> 34:16.340\n from the early universe.\n\n34:16.340 --> 34:19.140\n Yeah, LIGO's an incredible engineering project.\n\n34:19.140 --> 34:24.140\n It's the most sensitive, precise devices on Earth.\n\n34:24.660 --> 34:27.500\n The fact that humans can build something like that\n\n34:27.500 --> 34:31.340\n is truly awe inspiring from an engineering perspective.\n\n34:31.340 --> 34:34.820\n Right, but these gravitational waves from the early universe\n\n34:34.820 --> 34:38.420\n will probably be of a much longer wavelength\n\n34:38.420 --> 34:41.500\n than LIGO is capable of sensing,\n\n34:41.500 --> 34:44.620\n so there's a beautiful project\n\n34:44.620 --> 34:49.620\n that's contemplated to put lasers\n\n34:51.120 --> 34:54.980\n in different locations in the solar system.\n\n34:54.980 --> 34:56.420\n We really, really separate it\n\n34:56.420 --> 34:59.900\n by solar system scale differences,\n\n34:59.900 --> 35:03.400\n like artificial planets or moons in different places\n\n35:03.400 --> 35:06.060\n and see the tiny motions of those\n\n35:06.060 --> 35:07.220\n relative to one another\n\n35:07.220 --> 35:10.100\n as a signal of radiation from the Big Bang.\n\n35:10.100 --> 35:15.100\n We can also maybe indirectly see the imprint\n\n35:15.300 --> 35:18.340\n of gravitational waves from the early universe\n\n35:18.340 --> 35:23.040\n on the photons, the microwave background radiation.\n\n35:23.040 --> 35:27.240\n That is our present way of seeing into the earliest universe,\n\n35:27.240 --> 35:31.180\n but those photons interact much more strongly with matter.\n\n35:31.180 --> 35:32.980\n They're much more strongly processed,\n\n35:32.980 --> 35:37.980\n so they don't give us directly such an unprocessed view\n\n35:37.980 --> 35:41.100\n of the early universe, of the very early universe,\n\n35:41.100 --> 35:45.700\n but if gravitational waves leave some imprint on that\n\n35:45.700 --> 35:49.380\n as they move through, we could detect that too,\n\n35:49.380 --> 35:53.180\n and people are trying, as we speak,\n\n35:53.180 --> 35:56.860\n working very hard towards that goal.\n\n35:56.860 --> 35:58.980\n It's so exciting to think about a sensor\n\n35:58.980 --> 36:01.180\n the size of the solar system.\n\n36:01.180 --> 36:03.180\n That would be a fantastic,\n\n36:03.180 --> 36:06.100\n I mean, that would be a pinnacle artifact\n\n36:06.100 --> 36:08.100\n of human endeavor to me.\n\n36:08.100 --> 36:11.900\n It would be such an inspiring thing\n\n36:11.900 --> 36:14.220\n that just we want to know,\n\n36:15.140 --> 36:17.460\n and we go to these extraordinary lengths\n\n36:17.460 --> 36:20.860\n of making gigantic things that are also very sophisticated\n\n36:20.860 --> 36:22.260\n because what you're trying to do,\n\n36:22.260 --> 36:24.960\n you have to understand how they move.\n\n36:24.960 --> 36:28.020\n You have to understand the properties of light\n\n36:28.020 --> 36:30.900\n that are being used, the interference between light,\n\n36:30.900 --> 36:34.180\n and you have to be able to make the light with lasers\n\n36:34.180 --> 36:35.740\n and understand the quantum theory\n\n36:35.740 --> 36:38.300\n and get the timing exactly right.\n\n36:38.300 --> 36:40.100\n It's an extraordinary endeavor\n\n36:40.100 --> 36:42.100\n involving all kinds of knowledge\n\n36:42.100 --> 36:45.100\n from the very small to the very large,\n\n36:45.100 --> 36:49.060\n and all in the service of curiosity\n\n36:49.060 --> 36:51.380\n and built on a grand scale, so.\n\n36:52.540 --> 36:57.540\n Yeah, it would make me proud to be a human if we did that.\n\n36:58.340 --> 37:01.340\n I love that you're inspired both by the power of theory\n\n37:01.340 --> 37:02.580\n and the power of experiment.\n\n37:02.580 --> 37:07.580\n So both, I think, are exceptionally impressive\n\n37:07.860 --> 37:10.500\n that the human mind can come up with theories\n\n37:10.500 --> 37:13.200\n that give us a peek into how the universe works,\n\n37:13.200 --> 37:16.900\n but also construct tools that are way bigger\n\n37:16.900 --> 37:20.720\n than the evolutionary origins we came from.\n\n37:20.720 --> 37:22.060\n Right, and by the way,\n\n37:22.060 --> 37:25.740\n the fact that we can design such things and they work\n\n37:25.740 --> 37:28.200\n is an extraordinary demonstration\n\n37:28.200 --> 37:30.620\n that we really do understand a lot.\n\n37:30.620 --> 37:33.260\n And then in some ways.\n\n37:33.260 --> 37:36.220\n And it's our ability to answer questions\n\n37:36.220 --> 37:37.820\n that also leads us to be able\n\n37:37.820 --> 37:39.820\n to address more ambitious questions.\n\n37:39.820 --> 37:44.180\n So you mentioned at the Big Bang in the early days,\n\n37:45.140 --> 37:46.860\n things are pretty homogeneous.\n\n37:46.860 --> 37:47.820\n Yes.\n\n37:47.820 --> 37:51.660\n But here we are, sitting on Earth,\n\n37:51.660 --> 37:56.660\n two hairless apes, you could say, with microphones.\n\n37:57.040 --> 37:58.820\n In talking about the brief history of things,\n\n37:58.820 --> 38:00.780\n you said it's much harder to describe Sweden\n\n38:00.780 --> 38:03.780\n than it is the universe.\n\n38:03.780 --> 38:05.340\n So there's a lot of complexity.\n\n38:05.340 --> 38:07.420\n There was a lot of interesting details here.\n\n38:07.420 --> 38:11.260\n So how does this complexity come to be, do you think?\n\n38:11.260 --> 38:13.500\n It seems like there's these pockets.\n\n38:13.500 --> 38:14.340\n Yeah.\n\n38:14.340 --> 38:18.840\n We don't know how rare of like where hairless apes emerge.\n\n38:18.840 --> 38:19.680\n Yeah.\n\n38:19.680 --> 38:22.100\n And then that came from the initial soup\n\n38:22.100 --> 38:23.500\n that was homogeneous.\n\n38:23.500 --> 38:26.460\n Was that an accident?\n\n38:26.460 --> 38:31.460\n Well, we understand in broad outlines\n\n38:31.620 --> 38:33.660\n how it could happen.\n\n38:33.660 --> 38:36.380\n We certainly don't understand why it happened exactly\n\n38:36.380 --> 38:37.300\n in the way it did.\n\n38:40.180 --> 38:42.620\n Or there are certainly open questions\n\n38:42.620 --> 38:44.120\n about the origins of life\n\n38:44.120 --> 38:47.940\n and how inevitable the emergence of intelligence was\n\n38:47.940 --> 38:48.940\n and how that happened.\n\n38:48.940 --> 38:52.180\n But in the very broadest terms,\n\n38:52.180 --> 38:57.180\n the universe early on was quite homogeneous,\n\n38:58.020 --> 39:00.160\n but not completely homogeneous.\n\n39:01.020 --> 39:06.020\n There were part in 10,000 fluctuations in density\n\n39:07.060 --> 39:09.540\n within this primordial plasma.\n\n39:10.580 --> 39:15.580\n And as time goes on, there's an instability\n\n39:16.860 --> 39:20.140\n which causes those density contrasts to increase.\n\n39:20.140 --> 39:21.700\n There's a gravitational instability\n\n39:21.700 --> 39:24.620\n where it's denser, the gravitational attractions\n\n39:24.620 --> 39:25.580\n are stronger.\n\n39:25.580 --> 39:27.300\n And so that brings in more matter\n\n39:27.300 --> 39:29.780\n and it gets even denser and so on and so on.\n\n39:29.780 --> 39:34.380\n So there's a natural tendency of matter to clump\n\n39:34.380 --> 39:37.180\n because of gravitational interactions.\n\n39:37.180 --> 39:39.860\n And then the equation is complicated.\n\n39:39.860 --> 39:42.900\n We have lots of things clumping together.\n\n39:43.980 --> 39:47.060\n Then we know what the laws are,\n\n39:47.060 --> 39:50.020\n but we have to a certain extent wave our hands\n\n39:50.020 --> 39:51.900\n about what happens.\n\n39:51.900 --> 39:56.220\n But basic understanding of chemistry\n\n39:56.220 --> 40:00.140\n says that if things and the physics of radiation\n\n40:00.140 --> 40:02.840\n tells us that as things start to clump together,\n\n40:02.840 --> 40:05.540\n they can radiate, give off some energy.\n\n40:05.540 --> 40:07.900\n So they don't just, they slow down.\n\n40:07.900 --> 40:09.300\n As a result, they lose energy.\n\n40:09.300 --> 40:12.340\n They can collaborate together, cool down,\n\n40:12.340 --> 40:16.220\n form things like stars, form things like planets.\n\n40:16.220 --> 40:19.260\n And so in broad terms, there's no mystery.\n\n40:19.260 --> 40:22.300\n There's, that's what the scenario,\n\n40:22.300 --> 40:25.580\n that's what the equations tell you should happen.\n\n40:25.580 --> 40:30.580\n But because it's a process involving\n\n40:30.580 --> 40:33.720\n many, many fundamental individual units,\n\n40:37.100 --> 40:40.620\n the application of the laws that govern individual units\n\n40:40.620 --> 40:44.740\n to these things is very delicate,\n\n40:46.100 --> 40:48.220\n computationally very difficult.\n\n40:48.220 --> 40:52.020\n And more profoundly, the equations have\n\n40:52.020 --> 40:54.260\n this probability of chaos or sensitivity\n\n40:54.260 --> 40:57.380\n to initial conditions, which tells you tiny differences\n\n40:57.380 --> 41:00.700\n in the initial state can lead to enormous differences\n\n41:00.700 --> 41:02.440\n in the subsequent behavior.\n\n41:02.440 --> 41:07.440\n So physics, fundamental physics at some point says,\n\n41:08.340 --> 41:11.760\n okay, chemists, biologists, this is your problem.\n\n41:11.760 --> 41:16.680\n And then again, in broad terms,\n\n41:16.680 --> 41:21.680\n we know how it's conceivable that the humans\n\n41:23.100 --> 41:28.140\n and things like that, how complex structure can emerge.\n\n41:28.140 --> 41:33.140\n It's a matter of having the right kind of temperature\n\n41:34.040 --> 41:36.300\n and the right kind of stuff.\n\n41:36.300 --> 41:41.300\n So you need to be able to make chemical bonds\n\n41:41.300 --> 41:42.860\n that are reasonably stable\n\n41:42.860 --> 41:45.380\n and be able to make complex structures.\n\n41:45.380 --> 41:48.700\n And we're very fortunate that carbon has this ability\n\n41:48.700 --> 41:53.700\n to make backbones and elaborate branchings and things.\n\n41:54.220 --> 41:57.580\n So you can get complex things that we call biochemistry.\n\n41:57.580 --> 42:01.140\n And yet the bonds can be broken a little bit\n\n42:01.140 --> 42:04.760\n with the help of energetic injections from the sun.\n\n42:04.760 --> 42:07.440\n So you have to have both the possibility of changing,\n\n42:07.440 --> 42:10.580\n but also the useful degree of stability.\n\n42:10.580 --> 42:15.580\n And we know at that very, very broad level, physics\n\n42:15.820 --> 42:17.780\n can tell you that it's conceivable.\n\n42:17.780 --> 42:22.780\n If you want to know what really happened,\n\n42:23.140 --> 42:26.260\n what really can happen, then you have to work a bit,\n\n42:26.260 --> 42:27.100\n go to chemistry.\n\n42:27.100 --> 42:29.820\n If you want to know what actually happened,\n\n42:29.820 --> 42:32.260\n then you really have to consult the fossil record\n\n42:32.260 --> 42:33.220\n and biologists.\n\n42:33.220 --> 42:38.220\n And so these ways of addressing the issue\n\n42:41.220 --> 42:43.400\n are complimentary in a sense.\n\n42:43.400 --> 42:48.400\n They use different kinds of concepts,\n\n42:49.660 --> 42:52.480\n they use different languages\n\n42:52.480 --> 42:54.340\n and they address different kinds of questions,\n\n42:54.340 --> 42:59.340\n but they're not inconsistent, they're just complimentary.\n\n42:59.340 --> 43:03.740\n It's kind of interesting to think about those early fluctuations\n\n43:03.740 --> 43:07.140\n as our earliest ancestors.\n\n43:07.140 --> 43:08.180\n Yes, that's right.\n\n43:08.180 --> 43:13.180\n So it's amazing to think that this is the modern answer\n\n43:15.900 --> 43:20.900\n to the, or the modern version of what the Hindu philosophers\n\n43:24.100 --> 43:25.740\n had, that art thou.\n\n43:25.740 --> 43:30.480\n If you ask what, okay, those little quantum fluctuations\n\n43:30.480 --> 43:34.480\n in the early universe are the seeds out of which complexity,\n\n43:36.380 --> 43:40.900\n including plausibly humans, really evolve.\n\n43:40.900 --> 43:42.260\n You don't need anything else.\n\n43:42.260 --> 43:47.260\n That brings up the question of asking for a friend here\n\n43:47.260 --> 43:52.140\n if there's other pockets of complexity,\n\n43:52.140 --> 43:57.140\n commonly called as alien intelligent civilizations out there.\n\n43:59.420 --> 44:00.900\n Well, we don't know for sure,\n\n44:00.900 --> 44:05.740\n but I have a strong suspicion that the answer is yes\n\n44:05.740 --> 44:10.740\n because the one case we do have at hand to study\n\n44:13.500 --> 44:17.720\n here on Earth, we sort of know what the conditions were\n\n44:17.720 --> 44:18.880\n that were helpful to life,\n\n44:18.880 --> 44:21.700\n the right kind of temperature, the right kind of star\n\n44:21.700 --> 44:24.260\n that keeps, maintains that temperature for a long time,\n\n44:24.260 --> 44:26.420\n the liquid environment of water.\n\n44:28.420 --> 44:33.420\n And once those conditions emerged on Earth,\n\n44:33.800 --> 44:36.060\n which was roughly four and a half billion years ago,\n\n44:36.060 --> 44:39.700\n it wasn't very long before what we call life\n\n44:39.700 --> 44:41.580\n started to leave relics.\n\n44:41.580 --> 44:46.580\n So we can find forms of life, primitive forms of life\n\n44:47.060 --> 44:49.980\n that are almost as old as the Earth itself\n\n44:49.980 --> 44:54.980\n in the sense that once the Earth was turned\n\n44:55.180 --> 44:58.660\n from a very hot boiling thing\n\n44:58.660 --> 45:02.340\n and cooled off into a solid mass with water,\n\n45:02.340 --> 45:03.940\n life emerged very, very quickly.\n\n45:03.940 --> 45:07.820\n So it seems that these general conditions for life\n\n45:09.180 --> 45:13.860\n are enough to make it happen relatively quickly.\n\n45:13.860 --> 45:18.860\n Now, the other lesson I think that one can draw\n\n45:21.500 --> 45:24.580\n from this one example, it's dangerous to draw lessons\n\n45:24.580 --> 45:27.620\n from one example, but that's all we've got,\n\n45:27.620 --> 45:32.020\n and that the emergence of intelligent life\n\n45:32.020 --> 45:34.220\n is a different issue altogether.\n\n45:35.340 --> 45:40.340\n That took a long time and seems to have been\n\n45:40.340 --> 45:45.340\n pretty contingent for a long time.\n\n45:47.300 --> 45:50.580\n Well, for most of the history of life,\n\n45:50.580 --> 45:54.060\n it was single celled things.\n\n45:55.060 --> 45:58.020\n Even multicellular life only rose\n\n45:58.020 --> 46:01.620\n about 600 million years ago, so much after.\n\n46:01.620 --> 46:06.620\n And then intelligence is kind of a luxury.\n\n46:12.540 --> 46:17.540\n Many more kinds of creatures have big stomachs\n\n46:18.100 --> 46:20.220\n than big brains.\n\n46:20.220 --> 46:25.180\n In fact, most have no brains at all in any reasonable sense.\n\n46:25.180 --> 46:30.140\n And the dinosaurs ruled for a long, long time\n\n46:30.140 --> 46:31.500\n and some of them were pretty smart,\n\n46:31.500 --> 46:35.300\n but they were at best bird brains\n\n46:35.300 --> 46:37.700\n because birds came from the dinosaurs.\n\n46:37.700 --> 46:41.540\n And it could have stayed that way.\n\n46:41.540 --> 46:46.260\n And then the emergence of humans was very contingent\n\n46:46.260 --> 46:49.620\n and kind of a very, very recent development\n\n46:49.620 --> 46:51.900\n on evolutionary timescales.\n\n46:51.900 --> 46:55.100\n And you can argue about the level of human intelligence,\n\n46:55.100 --> 46:58.460\n but I think that's what we're talking about.\n\n46:58.460 --> 47:02.260\n It's very impressive and can ask these kinds of questions\n\n47:02.260 --> 47:04.020\n and discuss them intelligently.\n\n47:07.020 --> 47:12.020\n So I guess my, so this is a long winded answer\n\n47:13.380 --> 47:16.940\n or justification of my feeling\n\n47:16.940 --> 47:21.940\n is that the conditions for life in some form\n\n47:21.940 --> 47:26.940\n are probably satisfied many, many places\n\n47:28.700 --> 47:32.140\n around the universe and even within our galaxy.\n\n47:33.260 --> 47:36.020\n I'm not so sure about the emergence of intelligent life\n\n47:36.980 --> 47:41.500\n or the emergence of technological civilizations.\n\n47:41.500 --> 47:46.500\n That seems much more contingent and special.\n\n47:47.420 --> 47:50.380\n And we might, it's conceivable to me\n\n47:50.380 --> 47:52.820\n that we're the only example in the galaxy.\n\n47:54.460 --> 47:56.660\n Although, yeah, I don't know one way or the other.\n\n47:56.660 --> 47:59.660\n I have different opinions on different days of the week.\n\n47:59.660 --> 48:01.420\n But one of the things that worries me\n\n48:01.420 --> 48:04.700\n in the spirit of being humble,\n\n48:04.700 --> 48:08.060\n that our particular kind of intelligence\n\n48:09.060 --> 48:10.700\n is not very special.\n\n48:10.700 --> 48:13.700\n So there's all kinds of different intelligences.\n\n48:13.700 --> 48:15.020\n And even more broadly,\n\n48:15.020 --> 48:19.060\n there could be many different kinds of life.\n\n48:19.060 --> 48:22.420\n So the basic definition, and I just had,\n\n48:22.420 --> 48:24.860\n I think somebody that you know, Sarah Walker,\n\n48:24.860 --> 48:27.260\n I just had a very long conversation with her\n\n48:27.260 --> 48:29.380\n about even just the very basic question\n\n48:29.380 --> 48:34.380\n of trying to define what is life from a physics perspective.\n\n48:34.580 --> 48:36.060\n Even that question within itself,\n\n48:36.060 --> 48:38.180\n I think one of the most fundamental questions\n\n48:38.180 --> 48:41.100\n in science and physics and everything\n\n48:41.100 --> 48:43.860\n is just trying to get a hold,\n\n48:43.860 --> 48:45.500\n trying to get some universal laws\n\n48:45.500 --> 48:47.420\n around the ideas of what is life\n\n48:47.420 --> 48:49.660\n because that kind of unlocks a bunch of things\n\n48:49.660 --> 48:52.460\n around life, intelligence, consciousness,\n\n48:52.460 --> 48:53.420\n all those kinds of things.\n\n48:53.420 --> 48:55.060\n I agree with you in a sense,\n\n48:55.060 --> 48:56.580\n but I think that's a dangerous question\n\n48:56.580 --> 49:01.580\n because the answer can't be any more precise\n\n49:01.740 --> 49:02.940\n than the question.\n\n49:02.940 --> 49:06.220\n And the question, what is life,\n\n49:07.980 --> 49:11.340\n kind of assumes that we have a definition of life\n\n49:11.340 --> 49:12.900\n and that it's a natural phenomena\n\n49:12.900 --> 49:14.660\n that can be distinguished.\n\n49:14.660 --> 49:17.580\n But really there are edge cases like viruses\n\n49:17.580 --> 49:20.740\n and some people would like to say\n\n49:20.740 --> 49:25.020\n that electrons have consciousness.\n\n49:25.020 --> 49:28.700\n So you can't, if you really have fuzzy concepts,\n\n49:28.700 --> 49:33.700\n it's very hard to reach precise kinds of scientific answers.\n\n49:34.060 --> 49:37.020\n But I think there's a very fruitful question\n\n49:37.020 --> 49:39.020\n that's adjacent to it,\n\n49:39.020 --> 49:42.060\n which has been pursued in different forms\n\n49:42.060 --> 49:44.980\n for quite a while\n\n49:44.980 --> 49:47.820\n and is now becoming very sophisticated\n\n49:47.820 --> 49:50.020\n in reaching in new directions.\n\n49:50.020 --> 49:53.900\n And that is, what are the states of matter\n\n49:53.900 --> 49:55.100\n that are possible?\n\n49:55.100 --> 49:58.460\n So in high school or grade school,\n\n49:58.460 --> 50:01.740\n you learn about solids, liquids and gases,\n\n50:01.740 --> 50:04.700\n but that really just scratches the surface\n\n50:04.700 --> 50:07.820\n of different ways that are distinguishable,\n\n50:07.820 --> 50:12.820\n that matter can form into macroscopically different,\n\n50:15.060 --> 50:17.420\n meaningful patterns that we call phases.\n\n50:17.420 --> 50:19.460\n And then there are precise definitions\n\n50:19.460 --> 50:21.660\n of what we mean by phases of matter\n\n50:21.660 --> 50:26.100\n and that have been worked out fruitful over the decades.\n\n50:26.100 --> 50:29.820\n And we're discovering new states of matter all the time\n\n50:29.820 --> 50:33.260\n and kind of having to work at what we mean by matter.\n\n50:33.260 --> 50:35.980\n We're discovering the capabilities of matter\n\n50:35.980 --> 50:39.580\n to organize in interesting ways.\n\n50:39.580 --> 50:44.580\n And some of them, like liquid crystals,\n\n50:46.020 --> 50:49.060\n are important ingredients of life.\n\n50:49.060 --> 50:51.740\n Our cell membranes are liquid crystals,\n\n50:51.740 --> 50:54.100\n and that's very important to the way they work.\n\n50:55.500 --> 50:57.340\n Recently, there's been a development\n\n50:57.340 --> 51:01.500\n in where we're talking about states of matter\n\n51:01.500 --> 51:06.500\n that are not static, but that have dynamics,\n\n51:06.580 --> 51:09.620\n that have characteristic patterns,\n\n51:09.620 --> 51:11.540\n not only in space, but in time.\n\n51:11.540 --> 51:12.860\n These are called time crystals,\n\n51:12.860 --> 51:14.460\n and that's been a development\n\n51:14.460 --> 51:17.580\n that's just in the last decade or so.\n\n51:17.580 --> 51:20.820\n It's just really, really flourishing.\n\n51:20.820 --> 51:25.820\n And so is there a state of matter\n\n51:25.820 --> 51:30.820\n or a group of states of matter that corresponds to life?\n\n51:31.580 --> 51:34.460\n Maybe, but the answer can't be any more definite\n\n51:34.460 --> 51:35.900\n than the question.\n\n51:35.900 --> 51:38.620\n I mean, I gotta push back on the,\n\n51:38.620 --> 51:39.940\n those are just words.\n\n51:39.940 --> 51:41.980\n I mean, I disagree with you.\n\n51:41.980 --> 51:45.940\n The question points to a direction.\n\n51:45.940 --> 51:49.180\n The answer might be able to be more precise\n\n51:49.180 --> 51:53.300\n than the question, because just as you're saying,\n\n51:53.300 --> 51:56.660\n there is a, we could be discovering\n\n51:56.660 --> 51:59.740\n certain characteristics and patterns\n\n51:59.740 --> 52:02.860\n that are associated with a certain type of matter,\n\n52:02.860 --> 52:04.420\n macroscopically speaking,\n\n52:04.420 --> 52:09.420\n and that we can then be able to post facto say,\n\n52:10.620 --> 52:14.420\n this is, let's assign the word life to this kind of matter.\n\n52:14.420 --> 52:17.580\n I agree with that completely, that's what that's,\n\n52:17.580 --> 52:19.780\n but that's, so it's not a disagreement.\n\n52:19.780 --> 52:23.380\n It's very frequent in physics that, or in science,\n\n52:23.380 --> 52:26.820\n that words that are in common use\n\n52:26.820 --> 52:31.380\n get refined and reprocessed into scientific terms\n\n52:31.380 --> 52:34.280\n that's happened for things like force and energy.\n\n52:35.800 --> 52:38.780\n And so we, in a way, we find out\n\n52:38.780 --> 52:43.780\n what the useful definition is, or symmetry, for instance.\n\n52:43.900 --> 52:47.260\n And the common usage may be quite different\n\n52:47.260 --> 52:48.460\n from the scientific usage,\n\n52:48.460 --> 52:52.020\n but the scientific usage is special\n\n52:52.020 --> 52:53.340\n and takes on a life of its own,\n\n52:53.340 --> 52:57.700\n and we find out what the useful version of it is,\n\n52:59.820 --> 53:02.060\n the fruitful version of it is.\n\n53:02.060 --> 53:05.340\n So I do think, so in that spirit,\n\n53:05.340 --> 53:10.340\n I think if we can identify states of matter\n\n53:10.340 --> 53:15.340\n or linked states of matter that can carry on processes\n\n53:18.540 --> 53:22.420\n of self reproduction and development\n\n53:23.940 --> 53:27.380\n and information processing,\n\n53:28.260 --> 53:33.260\n we might be tempted to classify those things as life.\n\n53:34.260 --> 53:36.860\n Well, can I ask you about the craziest one,\n\n53:36.860 --> 53:41.540\n which is the one we know maybe least about,\n\n53:41.540 --> 53:42.700\n which is consciousness.\n\n53:42.700 --> 53:44.940\n Is it possible that there are certain kinds of matter\n\n53:44.940 --> 53:49.940\n would be able to classify as conscious,\n\n53:50.340 --> 53:54.380\n meaning like, so there's the panpsychists, right,\n\n53:54.380 --> 53:57.900\n who are the philosophers who kind of try to imply\n\n53:57.900 --> 54:01.220\n that all matter has some degree of consciousness,\n\n54:01.220 --> 54:04.220\n and you can almost construct like a physics of consciousness.\n\n54:04.220 --> 54:09.220\n Do you, again, we're in such early days of this,\n\n54:09.260 --> 54:13.100\n but nevertheless, it seems useful to talk about it.\n\n54:13.100 --> 54:15.860\n Is there some sense from a physics perspective\n\n54:15.860 --> 54:17.380\n to make sense of consciousness?\n\n54:18.860 --> 54:19.700\n Is there some hope?\n\n54:19.700 --> 54:24.700\n Well, again, consciousness is a very imprecise word\n\n54:24.820 --> 54:28.620\n and loaded with connotations that I think we should,\n\n54:28.620 --> 54:31.900\n we don't wanna start a scientific analysis with that,\n\n54:31.900 --> 54:34.260\n I don't think.\n\n54:34.260 --> 54:38.340\n It's often been important in science\n\n54:38.340 --> 54:41.700\n to start with simple cases and work up.\n\n54:43.020 --> 54:45.860\n Consciousness, I think what most people think of\n\n54:45.860 --> 54:47.740\n when you talk about consciousness is,\n\n54:47.740 --> 54:52.740\n okay, what am I doing in the world?\n\n54:52.980 --> 54:53.900\n This is my experience.\n\n54:53.900 --> 54:57.180\n I have a rich inner life and experience,\n\n54:57.180 --> 54:59.900\n and where is that in the equations?\n\n54:59.900 --> 55:02.220\n And I think that's a great question,\n\n55:02.220 --> 55:03.420\n a great, great question,\n\n55:03.420 --> 55:07.740\n and actually, I think I'm gearing up to spend part of,\n\n55:07.740 --> 55:10.980\n I mean, to try to address that in coming years.\n\n55:10.980 --> 55:12.660\n One version of asking that question,\n\n55:12.660 --> 55:14.420\n just as you said now,\n\n55:14.420 --> 55:19.060\n is what is the simplest formulation of that to study?\n\n55:19.060 --> 55:20.740\n I think I'm much more comfortable\n\n55:20.740 --> 55:23.780\n with the idea of studying self awareness\n\n55:23.780 --> 55:25.420\n as opposed to consciousness,\n\n55:25.420 --> 55:30.260\n because that sort of gets rid of the mystical aura of the thing.\n\n55:30.260 --> 55:33.780\n And self awareness is in simple,\n\n55:33.780 --> 55:38.780\n you know, I think contiguous at least\n\n55:38.980 --> 55:41.580\n with ideas about feedback.\n\n55:41.580 --> 55:45.380\n So if you have a system that looks at its own state\n\n55:45.380 --> 55:48.820\n and responds to it, that's a kind of self awareness.\n\n55:50.820 --> 55:54.460\n And more sophisticated versions\n\n55:54.460 --> 55:57.380\n could be like in information processing things,\n\n55:57.380 --> 56:00.540\n computers that look into their own internal state\n\n56:00.540 --> 56:02.060\n and do something about it.\n\n56:03.220 --> 56:08.220\n And I think that could also be done in neural nets.\n\n56:08.300 --> 56:10.260\n This is called recurrent neural nets,\n\n56:10.260 --> 56:12.860\n which are hard to understand and kind of a frontier.\n\n56:15.340 --> 56:18.340\n So I think understanding those\n\n56:18.340 --> 56:23.340\n and gradually building up a kind of profound ability\n\n56:26.500 --> 56:31.500\n to conceptualize different levels of self awareness.\n\n56:32.220 --> 56:33.540\n What do you have to not know?\n\n56:33.540 --> 56:34.620\n And what do you have to know?\n\n56:34.620 --> 56:36.740\n And when do you know that you don't know it?\n\n56:36.740 --> 56:38.180\n Or when do you, what do you think you know\n\n56:38.180 --> 56:39.220\n that you don't really know?\n\n56:39.220 --> 56:44.220\n And these, I think clarifying those issues,\n\n56:44.220 --> 56:47.300\n when we clarify those issues\n\n56:47.300 --> 56:51.420\n and get a rich theory around self awareness,\n\n56:51.420 --> 56:55.780\n I think that will illuminate the questions\n\n56:55.780 --> 56:58.180\n about consciousness in a way that, you know,\n\n56:58.180 --> 57:00.860\n scratching your chin and talking about qualia\n\n57:00.860 --> 57:04.260\n and blah, blah, blah, blah is never gonna do.\n\n57:04.260 --> 57:06.860\n Well, I also have a different approach to the whole thing.\n\n57:06.860 --> 57:09.060\n So there's, from a robotics perspective,\n\n57:09.060 --> 57:13.260\n you can engineer things that exhibit qualities\n\n57:13.260 --> 57:18.260\n of consciousness without understanding how things work.\n\n57:19.780 --> 57:24.780\n And from that perspective, you, it's like a back door,\n\n57:25.620 --> 57:28.020\n like enter through the psychology door.\n\n57:28.020 --> 57:32.180\n Precisely, I think we're on the same wavelength here.\n\n57:32.180 --> 57:35.300\n I think that, and let me just add one comment,\n\n57:35.300 --> 57:40.300\n which is I think we should try to understand consciousness\n\n57:40.300 --> 57:45.300\n as we experience it as, in evolutionary terms,\n\n57:48.940 --> 57:53.020\n and ask ourselves, why, why does it happen?\n\n57:53.020 --> 57:54.380\n This thing seems useful.\n\n57:54.380 --> 57:55.220\n Why is it useful?\n\n57:55.220 --> 57:56.340\n Why is it useful?\n\n57:56.340 --> 57:57.180\n Interesting question.\n\n57:57.180 --> 58:01.540\n I think we've got a conscious eyewatch here.\n\n58:01.540 --> 58:02.380\n Interesting question.\n\n58:02.380 --> 58:03.500\n Thank you, Siri.\n\n58:03.500 --> 58:04.340\n Okay.\n\n58:08.100 --> 58:09.660\n I'll get back to you later.\n\n58:09.660 --> 58:14.660\n The, and I think what we're gonna,\n\n58:14.820 --> 58:18.500\n I'm morally certain that what's gonna emerge\n\n58:18.500 --> 58:21.500\n from analyzing recurrent neural nets\n\n58:21.500 --> 58:26.380\n and robotic design and advanced computer design\n\n58:26.380 --> 58:31.380\n is that having this kind of looking at the internal state\n\n58:33.940 --> 58:38.420\n in a structured way that doesn't look at everything,\n\n58:38.420 --> 58:40.580\n this guy's has, it's encapsulated,\n\n58:40.580 --> 58:42.260\n looks at highly processed information,\n\n58:42.260 --> 58:44.380\n is very selective and makes choices\n\n58:44.380 --> 58:45.620\n without knowing how they're made.\n\n58:45.620 --> 58:47.360\n There's, there'll also be an unconscious.\n\n58:47.360 --> 58:49.460\n I think that that is gonna be,\n\n58:49.460 --> 58:51.940\n turn out to be really essential\n\n58:51.940 --> 58:55.460\n to doing efficient information processing.\n\n58:55.460 --> 58:59.340\n And that's why it evolved,\n\n58:59.340 --> 59:03.420\n because it's, it's, it's, it's helpful in,\n\n59:03.420 --> 59:06.240\n because brains come at a high cost.\n\n59:06.240 --> 59:09.480\n So there has to be, there has to be a good why.\n\n59:09.480 --> 59:10.960\n And there's a reason, yeah.\n\n59:10.960 --> 59:15.960\n They're rare in evolution and big brains\n\n59:16.640 --> 59:19.920\n are rare in evolution and they, they come at a big cost.\n\n59:19.920 --> 59:22.480\n You mean, if you, you, they, they,\n\n59:22.480 --> 59:25.960\n they have high metabolic demands.\n\n59:27.160 --> 59:30.640\n They require, you know, very active lifestyle,\n\n59:30.640 --> 59:35.640\n warm bloodedness and take, take away from the ability\n\n59:36.880 --> 59:39.160\n to support metabolism of digestion.\n\n59:39.160 --> 59:42.280\n And so, so it's, it's, it comes at a high cost.\n\n59:42.280 --> 59:44.320\n It has to, it has to pay back.\n\n59:44.320 --> 59:47.160\n Yeah, I think it has a lot of value in social interaction.\n\n59:47.160 --> 59:49.600\n So I actually am spending the rest of the day today\n\n59:49.600 --> 59:54.600\n and with our friends that are,\n\n59:54.960 --> 59:58.280\n our legged friends in robotic form at Boston Dynamics.\n\n59:58.280 --> 1:00:03.280\n And I think, so my probably biggest passion\n\n1:00:03.760 --> 1:00:05.760\n is human robot interaction.\n\n1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:09.480\n And it seems that consciousness from the perspective\n\n1:00:09.480 --> 1:00:12.920\n of the robot is very useful to improve\n\n1:00:12.920 --> 1:00:15.260\n the human robot interaction experience.\n\n1:00:16.560 --> 1:00:18.520\n The first, the display of consciousness,\n\n1:00:18.520 --> 1:00:20.200\n but then to me, there's a gray area\n\n1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:23.620\n between the display of consciousness and consciousness itself.\n\n1:00:23.620 --> 1:00:24.920\n If you think of consciousness\n\n1:00:24.920 --> 1:00:26.900\n from an evolutionary perspective,\n\n1:00:26.900 --> 1:00:29.880\n it seems like a useful tool in human communication, so.\n\n1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:32.040\n Yes, it's certainly, well,\n\n1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:35.240\n whatever consciousness is will turn out to be.\n\n1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:39.680\n I think addressing it through its use\n\n1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:42.060\n and working up from simple cases\n\n1:00:42.060 --> 1:00:45.680\n and also working up from engineering experience\n\n1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:48.760\n in trying to do efficient computation,\n\n1:00:48.760 --> 1:00:53.380\n including efficient management of social interactions\n\n1:00:53.380 --> 1:00:56.260\n is going to really shed light on these questions.\n\n1:00:56.260 --> 1:00:59.680\n As I said, in a way that sort of musing abstractly\n\n1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:01.640\n about consciousness never would.\n\n1:01:01.640 --> 1:01:04.060\n So as I mentioned, I talked to Sarah Walker\n\n1:01:04.060 --> 1:01:07.560\n and first of all, she says, hi, spoke very highly of you.\n\n1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:12.400\n One of her concerns about physics and physicists and humans\n\n1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:16.960\n is that we may not fully understand the system\n\n1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:18.980\n that we're inside of.\n\n1:01:18.980 --> 1:01:22.880\n Meaning like, there may be limits\n\n1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:24.440\n to the kind of physics we do\n\n1:01:24.440 --> 1:01:28.760\n in trying to understand the system of which we're part of.\n\n1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:33.760\n So like, the observer is also the observed.\n\n1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:36.720\n In that sense, it seems like\n\n1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:42.760\n our tools of understanding the world,\n\n1:01:42.760 --> 1:01:44.840\n I mean, this is mostly centered around the questions\n\n1:01:44.840 --> 1:01:47.520\n of what is life, trying to understand the patterns\n\n1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:51.320\n that are characteristic of life and intelligence,\n\n1:01:51.320 --> 1:01:53.280\n all those kinds of things.\n\n1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:57.320\n We're not using the right tools because we're in the system.\n\n1:01:57.320 --> 1:02:01.320\n Is there something that resonates with you there?\n\n1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:02.160\n Almost like...\n\n1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:07.160\n Well, yes, we have limitations, of course,\n\n1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:11.720\n in the amount of information we can process.\n\n1:02:12.680 --> 1:02:16.800\n On the other hand, we can get help from our Silicon friends\n\n1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:21.420\n and we can get help from all kinds of instruments\n\n1:02:21.420 --> 1:02:24.220\n that make up for our perceptual deficits.\n\n1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:30.040\n And we can use, at a conceptual level,\n\n1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:32.760\n we can use different kinds of concepts\n\n1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:35.360\n to address different kinds of questions.\n\n1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:40.280\n So I'm not sure exactly what problem she's talking about.\n\n1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:45.280\n It's a problem akin to an organism living in a 2D plane\n\n1:02:45.600 --> 1:02:47.800\n trying to understand a three dimensional world.\n\n1:02:47.800 --> 1:02:48.920\n Well, we can do that.\n\n1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:53.360\n I mean, in fact, for practical purposes,\n\n1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:55.840\n most of our experience is two dimensional.\n\n1:02:55.840 --> 1:02:57.680\n It's hard to move vertically.\n\n1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:00.400\n And yet we've produced conceptually\n\n1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:01.800\n a three dimensional symmetry\n\n1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:04.440\n and in fact, four dimensional space time.\n\n1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:10.440\n So by thinking in appropriate ways and using instruments\n\n1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:14.860\n and getting consistent accounts and rich accounts,\n\n1:03:14.860 --> 1:03:19.200\n we find out what concepts are necessary.\n\n1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:25.960\n And I don't see any end in sight of the process\n\n1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:30.960\n or any showstoppers because, let me give you an example.\n\n1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:35.400\n I mean, for instance, QCD,\n\n1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:37.360\n our theory of the strong interaction,\n\n1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:40.360\n has nice equations, which I helped to discover.\n\n1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:41.280\n What's QCD?\n\n1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:42.880\n Quantum chromodynamics.\n\n1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:47.480\n So it's our theory of the strong interaction,\n\n1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:51.400\n the interaction that is responsible for nuclear physics.\n\n1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:53.120\n So it's the interaction that governs\n\n1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:55.340\n how quarks and gluons interact with each other\n\n1:03:55.340 --> 1:03:59.360\n and make protons and neutrons\n\n1:03:59.360 --> 1:04:03.120\n and all the strong, the related particles\n\n1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:05.360\n and many things in physics.\n\n1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:07.960\n It's one of the four basic forces of nature\n\n1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:09.800\n as we presently understand it.\n\n1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:14.800\n And so we have beautiful equations,\n\n1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:20.800\n which we can test in very special circumstances\n\n1:04:22.620 --> 1:04:25.680\n using at high energies, at accelerators.\n\n1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:28.700\n So we're certain that these equations are correct.\n\n1:04:28.700 --> 1:04:30.520\n Prizes are given for it and so on.\n\n1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:32.760\n And people try to knock it down and they can't.\n\n1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:37.760\n Yeah, but the situations in which we can calculate\n\n1:04:43.020 --> 1:04:46.280\n the consequences of these equations are very limited.\n\n1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:51.280\n So for instance, no one has been able to demonstrate\n\n1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:57.080\n that this theory, which is built on quarks and gluons,\n\n1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:01.080\n which no one, which you don't observe,\n\n1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:03.360\n actually produces protons and neutrons\n\n1:05:03.360 --> 1:05:04.560\n and the things you do observe.\n\n1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:06.760\n This is called the problem of confinement.\n\n1:05:07.640 --> 1:05:11.000\n So no one's been able to prove that analytically\n\n1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.520\n in a way that a human can understand.\n\n1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:16.640\n On the other hand, we can take these equations\n\n1:05:16.640 --> 1:05:20.400\n to a computer, to gigantic computers and compute.\n\n1:05:20.400 --> 1:05:25.440\n And by God, you get the world from it.\n\n1:05:25.440 --> 1:05:30.440\n So these equations in a way that we don't understand\n\n1:05:32.120 --> 1:05:36.760\n in terms of human concepts, we can't do the calculations,\n\n1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:39.020\n but our machines can do them.\n\n1:05:39.020 --> 1:05:43.480\n So with the help of what I like to call our silicon friends\n\n1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:46.600\n and their descendants in the future,\n\n1:05:46.600 --> 1:05:50.720\n we can understand in a different way\n\n1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:53.000\n that allows us to understand more.\n\n1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:56.480\n But I don't think we'll ever, no human is ever going\n\n1:05:56.480 --> 1:06:00.560\n to be able to solve those equations in the same way.\n\n1:06:00.560 --> 1:06:04.760\n So, but I think that's, you know,\n\n1:06:04.760 --> 1:06:09.560\n when we find limitations to our natural abilities,\n\n1:06:09.560 --> 1:06:12.880\n we can try to find workarounds.\n\n1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:15.160\n And sometimes that's appropriate concepts.\n\n1:06:15.160 --> 1:06:17.320\n Sometimes it's appropriate instruments.\n\n1:06:17.320 --> 1:06:19.800\n Sometimes it's a combination of the two.\n\n1:06:19.800 --> 1:06:24.800\n But I think it's premature to get defeatist about it.\n\n1:06:26.220 --> 1:06:31.220\n I don't see any logical contradiction\n\n1:06:32.480 --> 1:06:35.040\n or paradox or limitation\n\n1:06:35.040 --> 1:06:38.320\n that will bring this process to a halt.\n\n1:06:38.320 --> 1:06:40.960\n Well, I think the idea is to continue thinking\n\n1:06:40.960 --> 1:06:42.880\n outside the box in different directions,\n\n1:06:42.880 --> 1:06:45.880\n meaning just like how the math allows us\n\n1:06:45.880 --> 1:06:47.280\n to think in multiple dimensions\n\n1:06:47.280 --> 1:06:52.280\n outside of our perception system, sort of thinking,\n\n1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:55.720\n you know, coming up with new tools\n\n1:06:55.720 --> 1:06:58.320\n of mathematics or computation or all those kinds of things\n\n1:06:58.320 --> 1:07:03.320\n to take different perspectives on our universe.\n\n1:07:04.220 --> 1:07:05.440\n Well, I'm all for that.\n\n1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:08.840\n You know, and I kind of have even elevated into a principle\n\n1:07:08.840 --> 1:07:11.520\n which is of complementarity following Bohr\n\n1:07:11.520 --> 1:07:16.520\n that you need different ways of thinking\n\n1:07:16.520 --> 1:07:18.600\n even about the same things\n\n1:07:18.600 --> 1:07:21.080\n in order to do justice to their reality\n\n1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:23.880\n and answer different kinds of questions about them.\n\n1:07:23.880 --> 1:07:27.480\n I mean, we've several times alluded to the fact\n\n1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:30.280\n that human beings are hard to understand\n\n1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:34.560\n and the concepts that you use to understand human beings\n\n1:07:34.560 --> 1:07:37.640\n if you wanna prescribe drugs for them\n\n1:07:37.640 --> 1:07:42.560\n or see what's gonna happen if they move very fast\n\n1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:45.160\n or are exposed to radiation.\n\n1:07:45.160 --> 1:07:47.200\n And so that requires one kind of thinking\n\n1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:52.080\n that's very physical based on the fact\n\n1:07:52.080 --> 1:07:55.480\n that the materials that were made out of.\n\n1:07:55.480 --> 1:07:57.680\n On the other hand, if you want to understand\n\n1:07:57.680 --> 1:07:59.440\n how a person's going to behave\n\n1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:01.280\n in a different kind of situation,\n\n1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:06.120\n you need entirely different concepts from psychology\n\n1:08:06.120 --> 1:08:08.480\n and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\n1:08:08.480 --> 1:08:09.760\n You can have very different ways\n\n1:08:09.760 --> 1:08:11.840\n of addressing the same material\n\n1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:14.920\n that are useful for different purposes, right?\n\n1:08:14.920 --> 1:08:16.120\n Can you describe this idea\n\n1:08:16.120 --> 1:08:18.920\n which is fascinating of complementarity a little bit?\n\n1:08:18.920 --> 1:08:23.920\n Sort of first of all, what state is the principle?\n\n1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:26.800\n What is it?\n\n1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:29.160\n And second of all, what are good examples\n\n1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:30.960\n starting from quantum mechanics?\n\n1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:32.720\n You used to mention psychology.\n\n1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:33.560\n Let's talk about this more.\n\n1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:34.920\n It's like in your new book\n\n1:08:34.920 --> 1:08:37.120\n one of the most fascinating ideas actually.\n\n1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.280\n I think it's a wonderful, yeah.\n\n1:08:40.280 --> 1:08:43.160\n To me it's, well, it's the culminating chapter of the book\n\n1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:48.160\n and I think since the whole book is about the big lessons\n\n1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:52.520\n or big takeaways from profound understanding\n\n1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:55.520\n of the physical world that we've achieved,\n\n1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:59.000\n including that it's mysterious in some ways,\n\n1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:06.040\n this was the final overarching lesson, complementarity.\n\n1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:11.040\n Lesson, complementarity and it's a approach.\n\n1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:18.520\n So unlike some of these other things\n\n1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:20.640\n which are just facts about the world,\n\n1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:22.480\n like the world is both big and small\n\n1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:26.320\n and different sizes and is big but we're not small,\n\n1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:28.440\n things we talked about earlier\n\n1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:30.800\n and the fact that the universe is comprehensible\n\n1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:33.600\n and how complexity could emerge from simplicity\n\n1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:37.880\n and so those things are in the broad sense\n\n1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:39.760\n facts about the world.\n\n1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:42.560\n Complementarity is more an attitude towards the world\n\n1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:46.320\n than encouraged by the facts about the world.\n\n1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:51.320\n And it's the concept or the approach\n\n1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:59.320\n or the realization that it can be appropriate\n\n1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:02.880\n and useful and inevitable and unavoidable\n\n1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:07.880\n to use very different descriptions of the same object\n\n1:10:08.440 --> 1:10:11.680\n or the same system or the same situation\n\n1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:15.520\n to answer different kinds of questions\n\n1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:17.960\n that may be very different\n\n1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:22.560\n and even mutually uninterpretable,\n\n1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:27.720\n immutually incomprehensible.\n\n1:10:27.720 --> 1:10:28.960\n But both correct somehow.\n\n1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:32.720\n But both correct and sources of different kinds of insight\n\n1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:33.880\n which is so weird.\n\n1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:36.640\n But it seems to work in so many cases.\n\n1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:41.080\n It works in many cases and I think it's a deep fact\n\n1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:44.600\n about the world and how we should approach it.\n\n1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:49.600\n It's most rigorous form where it's actually a theorem\n\n1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:53.520\n if quantum mechanics is correct,\n\n1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:55.360\n occurs in quantum mechanics\n\n1:10:55.360 --> 1:11:00.360\n where the primary description of the world\n\n1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:03.400\n is in terms of wave functions.\n\n1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:04.720\n But let's not talk about the world.\n\n1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:07.480\n Let's just talk about a particle, an electron.\n\n1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:12.600\n The primary description of that electron\n\n1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:14.440\n is its wave function.\n\n1:11:14.440 --> 1:11:18.720\n And the wave function can be used to predict\n\n1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:21.840\n where it's gonna be.\n\n1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:24.200\n If you observe, it'll be in different places\n\n1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:27.520\n with different probabilities or how fast it's moving.\n\n1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:31.280\n And it'll also be moving in different ways\n\n1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:32.760\n with different probabilities.\n\n1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:35.240\n That's what quantum mechanics says.\n\n1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:38.920\n And you can predict either set of probabilities\n\n1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:40.160\n if you know what's gonna happen\n\n1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:45.160\n if I make an observation of the position or the velocity.\n\n1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:51.600\n So the wave function gives you ways of doing both of those.\n\n1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:54.480\n But to do it, to get those predictions,\n\n1:11:54.480 --> 1:11:57.320\n you have to process the wave function in different ways.\n\n1:11:57.320 --> 1:11:59.120\n You process it one way for position\n\n1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:01.520\n and in a different way for momentum.\n\n1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:05.400\n And those ways are mathematically incompatible.\n\n1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:08.480\n It's like you have a stone\n\n1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:11.120\n and you can sculpt it into a Venus de Milo\n\n1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:14.360\n or you can sculpt it into David, but you can't do both.\n\n1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:20.680\n And that's an example of complementarity.\n\n1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:22.560\n To answer different kinds of questions,\n\n1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:25.920\n you have to analyze the system in different ways\n\n1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:29.200\n that are mutually incompatible,\n\n1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:32.800\n but both valid to answer different kinds of questions.\n\n1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:34.880\n So in that case, it's a theorem,\n\n1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:38.920\n but I think it's a much more widespread phenomena\n\n1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:40.440\n that applies to many cases\n\n1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:42.400\n where we can't prove it as a theorem,\n\n1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:46.520\n but it's a piece of wisdom, if you like,\n\n1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:51.520\n and appears to be a very important insight.\n\n1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:53.840\n And if you ignore it,\n\n1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:58.840\n you can get very confused and misguided.\n\n1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:06.960\n Do you think this is a useful hack\n\n1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:10.560\n for ideas that we don't fully understand?\n\n1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:13.720\n Or is this somehow a fundamental property\n\n1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:16.760\n of all or many ideas,\n\n1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:19.360\n that you can take multiple perspectives\n\n1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:20.820\n and they're both true?\n\n1:13:20.820 --> 1:13:24.420\n Well, I think it's both.\n\n1:13:24.420 --> 1:13:26.040\n So it's both the answer to all questions.\n\n1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:27.400\n Yes, that's right.\n\n1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:28.920\n It's not either or, it's both.\n\n1:13:28.920 --> 1:13:32.760\n It's paralyzing to think that we live in a world\n\n1:13:32.760 --> 1:13:37.440\n that's fundamentally surrounded by complementary ideas.\n\n1:13:39.540 --> 1:13:44.040\n Because we somehow want to attach ourselves\n\n1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:45.720\n to absolute truths,\n\n1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:48.440\n and absolute truths certainly don't like the idea\n\n1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:50.080\n of complementarity.\n\n1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:53.160\n Yes, Einstein was very uncomfortable with complementarity.\n\n1:13:53.160 --> 1:13:55.280\n And in a broad sense,\n\n1:13:55.280 --> 1:13:57.420\n the famous Bohr Einstein debates\n\n1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:00.760\n revolved around this question\n\n1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:03.040\n of whether the complementarity\n\n1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:08.040\n that is a foundational feature of quantum mechanics,\n\n1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:09.240\n as we have it,\n\n1:14:10.620 --> 1:14:15.620\n is a permanent feature of the universe\n\n1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:19.040\n and our description of nature.\n\n1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:22.960\n And so far, quantum mechanics wins.\n\n1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:26.480\n And it's gone from triumph to triumph.\n\n1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:28.720\n Whether complementarity is rock bottom,\n\n1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:31.560\n I guess, you can never be sure.\n\n1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:34.220\n I mean, but it looks awfully good\n\n1:14:34.220 --> 1:14:35.560\n and it's been very successful.\n\n1:14:35.560 --> 1:14:40.400\n And certainly, complementarity has been extremely useful\n\n1:14:40.400 --> 1:14:43.460\n and fruitful in that domain,\n\n1:14:43.460 --> 1:14:48.460\n including some of Einstein's attempts to challenge it\n\n1:14:50.780 --> 1:14:55.460\n with the famous Einstein Podolsky Rosen experiment\n\n1:14:55.460 --> 1:14:57.380\n turned out to be confirmations\n\n1:14:57.380 --> 1:15:02.380\n that have been useful in themselves.\n\n1:15:03.300 --> 1:15:05.180\n But so thinking about these things was fruitful,\n\n1:15:05.180 --> 1:15:07.920\n but not in the way that Einstein hoped.\n\n1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:12.920\n Yeah, so as I said, in the case of quantum mechanics\n\n1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:24.640\n and this dilemma or dichotomy\n\n1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:29.280\n between processing the wave function in different ways,\n\n1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:30.120\n it's a theorem.\n\n1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:31.200\n They're mutually incompatible\n\n1:15:31.200 --> 1:15:32.880\n and the physical correlate of that\n\n1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:35.080\n is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle\n\n1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:38.880\n you can't have position and momentum determined at once.\n\n1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:46.600\n But in other cases, like one that I like to think about\n\n1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:50.120\n or like to point out as an example\n\n1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:52.980\n is free will and determinism.\n\n1:15:52.980 --> 1:15:57.240\n It's much less of a theorem\n\n1:15:57.240 --> 1:16:02.240\n and more a kind of way of thinking about things\n\n1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:10.680\n that I think is reassuring\n\n1:16:10.680 --> 1:16:15.680\n and avoids a lot of unnecessary quarreling and confusion.\n\n1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:17.480\n The quarreling I'm okay with\n\n1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:18.960\n and the confusion I'm okay with,\n\n1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:21.640\n I mean, people debate about difficult ideas,\n\n1:16:21.640 --> 1:16:24.560\n but the question is whether it could be\n\n1:16:24.560 --> 1:16:26.880\n almost a fundamental truth.\n\n1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:28.280\n I think it is a fundamental truth.\n\n1:16:28.280 --> 1:16:32.640\n That free will is both an illusion and not.\n\n1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:34.240\n Yes, I think that's correct.\n\n1:16:35.960 --> 1:16:39.280\n There's a reason why people say quantum mechanics is weird\n\n1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:42.840\n and complementarity is a big part of that.\n\n1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:48.760\n To say that our actual whole world is weird,\n\n1:16:48.760 --> 1:16:52.140\n the whole hierarchy of the universe is weird\n\n1:16:52.140 --> 1:16:54.440\n in this kind of particular way,\n\n1:16:54.440 --> 1:16:59.440\n and it's quite profound, but it's also humbling\n\n1:17:03.240 --> 1:17:06.720\n because it's like we're never going to be on sturdy ground\n\n1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:09.280\n in the way that humans like to be.\n\n1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:13.760\n It's like you have to embrace that this whole thing\n\n1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:18.080\n is like unsteady mess.\n\n1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:21.560\n It's one of many lessons in humility\n\n1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:26.560\n that we run into in profound understanding of the world.\n\n1:17:28.600 --> 1:17:30.720\n The Copernican revolution was one,\n\n1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:35.200\n that the earth is not the center of the universe.\n\n1:17:35.200 --> 1:17:36.960\n Darwinian evolution is another,\n\n1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:53.960\n that humans are not the pinnacle of God's creation and the apparent result\n\n1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:57.640\n of deep understanding of physical reality,\n\n1:17:57.640 --> 1:18:05.520\n that mind emerges from matter and there's no call\n\n1:18:05.520 --> 1:18:07.960\n on special life forces or souls.\n\n1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:11.440\n These are all lessons in humility,\n\n1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:19.120\n and I actually find complementarity a liberating concept.\n\n1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:21.560\n It's, okay, you know, we...\n\n1:18:21.560 --> 1:18:22.640\n Yeah, it is in a way.\n\n1:18:22.640 --> 1:18:28.080\n That is what I remember.\n\n1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:30.880\n There's a story about Dr. Johnson,\n\n1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:32.640\n and he's talking with Boswell,\n\n1:18:32.640 --> 1:18:36.400\n and Boswell was, they were discussing a sermon\n\n1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:37.800\n that they'd both heard,\n\n1:18:37.800 --> 1:18:43.600\n and the sort of culmination of the sermon was the speaker saying,\n\n1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:45.440\n I accept the universe.\n\n1:18:45.440 --> 1:18:50.720\n And Dr. Johnson said, well, damn well better.\n\n1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:55.720\n And there's a certain joy in accepting the universe\n\n1:18:55.720 --> 1:18:57.760\n because it's mind expanding.\n\n1:18:57.760 --> 1:19:10.160\n And to me, complementarity also suggests tolerance,\n\n1:19:10.160 --> 1:19:15.880\n suggests opportunities for understanding things\n\n1:19:15.880 --> 1:19:22.760\n in different ways that add to rather than detract\n\n1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:25.120\n from understanding.\n\n1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:29.960\n So I think it's an opportunity for mind expansion\n\n1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:33.160\n and demanding that there's only one way\n\n1:19:33.160 --> 1:19:36.720\n to think about things can be very limiting.\n\n1:19:36.720 --> 1:19:38.840\n On the free will one, that's a trippy one, though.\n\n1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:43.520\n To think like I am the decider of my own actions\n\n1:19:43.520 --> 1:19:49.760\n and at the same time I'm not is tricky to think about,\n\n1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:53.840\n but there does seem to be some kind of profound truth in that.\n\n1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:56.880\n I get, well, I think it is tied up.\n\n1:19:56.880 --> 1:20:00.320\n It will turn out to be tied up when we understand things better\n\n1:20:00.320 --> 1:20:04.640\n with these issues of self awareness and where we get,\n\n1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:06.960\n what we perceive as making choices,\n\n1:20:06.960 --> 1:20:12.120\n what does that really mean and what's going on under the hood.\n\n1:20:12.120 --> 1:20:15.000\n But I'm speculating about a future understanding\n\n1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:17.000\n that's not in place at present.\n\n1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:19.960\n Your sense there will always be,\n\n1:20:19.960 --> 1:20:22.880\n like as you dig into the self awareness thing,\n\n1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:24.600\n there'll always be some places\n\n1:20:24.600 --> 1:20:26.640\n where complementarity is gonna show up.\n\n1:20:26.640 --> 1:20:28.040\n Oh, definitely, yeah.\n\n1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:31.560\n I mean, there will be, how should I say?\n\n1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:33.720\n There'll be kind of a God's eye view\n\n1:20:33.720 --> 1:20:37.400\n which sees everything that's going on\n\n1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:40.120\n in the computer or the brain.\n\n1:20:40.120 --> 1:20:42.280\n And then there's the brain's own view\n\n1:20:42.280 --> 1:20:46.240\n or the central processor or whatever it is,\n\n1:20:46.240 --> 1:20:50.760\n what we call the self, the consciousness,\n\n1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:53.480\n that's only aware of a very small part of it.\n\n1:20:53.480 --> 1:20:54.800\n And those are very different.\n\n1:20:54.800 --> 1:20:59.720\n Those are, so the God's eye view can be deterministic\n\n1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:04.720\n while the self view sees free will.\n\n1:21:07.880 --> 1:21:11.440\n I'm pretty sure that's how it's gonna work out actually.\n\n1:21:11.440 --> 1:21:15.160\n But as it stands, free will is a concept\n\n1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:19.280\n that we definitely, at least I feel I definitely experience,\n\n1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:21.600\n I can choose to do one thing then another.\n\n1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:24.920\n And other people I think are sufficiently similar to me\n\n1:21:24.920 --> 1:21:28.420\n that I trust that they feel the same way.\n\n1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:33.600\n And it's an essential concept in psychology\n\n1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:35.680\n and law and so forth.\n\n1:21:35.680 --> 1:21:40.680\n But at the same time, I think that mind emerges from matter\n\n1:21:42.520 --> 1:21:47.360\n and that there's an alternative description of matter\n\n1:21:47.360 --> 1:21:51.160\n that's up to subtleties about quantum mechanics,\n\n1:21:51.160 --> 1:21:53.960\n which I don't think are relevant here,\n\n1:21:53.960 --> 1:21:56.180\n really is deterministic.\n\n1:21:56.180 --> 1:21:57.960\n Let me ask you about some particles.\n\n1:21:57.960 --> 1:21:59.200\n Okay.\n\n1:21:59.200 --> 1:22:00.880\n First the absurd question,\n\n1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:04.980\n almost like a question that like Plato would ask.\n\n1:22:04.980 --> 1:22:07.740\n What is the smallest thing in the universe?\n\n1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:13.520\n As far as we know, the fundamental particles\n\n1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:17.480\n out of which we build our most successful description\n\n1:22:17.480 --> 1:22:20.040\n of nature are points.\n\n1:22:20.040 --> 1:22:24.880\n They don't have any internal structure.\n\n1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:29.980\n So that's as small as can be.\n\n1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:34.000\n So what does that mean operationally?\n\n1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:39.000\n That means that they obey equations that describe entities\n\n1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:44.000\n that are singular concentrations of energy,\n\n1:22:46.240 --> 1:22:47.720\n momentum, angular momentum,\n\n1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:50.080\n the things that particles have,\n\n1:22:50.080 --> 1:22:53.460\n but localized at individual points.\n\n1:22:53.460 --> 1:22:57.960\n Now that mathematical structure\n\n1:22:57.960 --> 1:23:01.420\n is only revealed partially in the world\n\n1:23:01.420 --> 1:23:04.600\n because to process the wave function\n\n1:23:04.600 --> 1:23:09.360\n in a way that accesses information about the precise\n\n1:23:09.360 --> 1:23:12.080\n position of things, you have to apply a lot of energy\n\n1:23:12.080 --> 1:23:14.960\n and that's an idealization\n\n1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:16.720\n and you can apply infinite amount of energy\n\n1:23:16.720 --> 1:23:19.880\n to determine a precise position.\n\n1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:22.440\n But at the mathematical level,\n\n1:23:23.560 --> 1:23:26.560\n we build the world out of particles that are points.\n\n1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:29.280\n So do they actually exist and what are we talking about?\n\n1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:30.120\n Oh, they exist.\n\n1:23:30.120 --> 1:23:33.000\n So let me ask sort of do quarks exist?\n\n1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:36.200\n Yes, do electrons exist?\n\n1:23:36.200 --> 1:23:37.720\n Yes, do photons exist?\n\n1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:38.540\n Yes.\n\n1:23:38.540 --> 1:23:39.720\n But what does it mean for them to exist?\n\n1:23:39.720 --> 1:23:43.520\n Okay, so well, the hard answer to that,\n\n1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:48.520\n the precise answer is that we construct the world\n\n1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:51.880\n out of equations that contain entities\n\n1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:56.720\n that are reproducible,\n\n1:23:56.720 --> 1:24:00.860\n that exist in vast numbers throughout the universe,\n\n1:24:00.860 --> 1:24:05.860\n that have definite properties of mass,\n\n1:24:05.900 --> 1:24:10.900\n spin and a few others that we call electrons\n\n1:24:13.420 --> 1:24:17.220\n and what an electron is is defined by the equations\n\n1:24:17.220 --> 1:24:19.920\n that it satisfies theoretically\n\n1:24:19.920 --> 1:24:24.160\n and we find that there are many, many exemplars\n\n1:24:24.160 --> 1:24:28.860\n of that entity in the physical world.\n\n1:24:28.860 --> 1:24:31.300\n So in the case of electrons,\n\n1:24:31.300 --> 1:24:34.260\n we can isolate them and study them\n\n1:24:34.260 --> 1:24:36.740\n and individual ones in great detail\n\n1:24:36.740 --> 1:24:41.100\n and we can check that they all actually are identical\n\n1:24:42.100 --> 1:24:45.420\n and that's why chemistry works and yes.\n\n1:24:45.420 --> 1:24:49.820\n So in that case, it's very tangible.\n\n1:24:49.820 --> 1:24:51.020\n Similarly with photons,\n\n1:24:51.020 --> 1:24:55.180\n you can study them individually, the units of light\n\n1:24:55.180 --> 1:24:59.900\n and nowadays, it's very practical\n\n1:24:59.900 --> 1:25:01.560\n to study individual photons\n\n1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:05.660\n and determine their spin and their other basic properties\n\n1:25:05.660 --> 1:25:10.660\n and check out the equations in great detail.\n\n1:25:11.100 --> 1:25:13.480\n For quarks and gluons,\n\n1:25:13.480 --> 1:25:16.780\n which are the other two main ingredients\n\n1:25:16.780 --> 1:25:21.780\n of our model of matter that's so successful,\n\n1:25:22.300 --> 1:25:23.580\n it's a little more complicated\n\n1:25:23.580 --> 1:25:28.320\n because the quarks and gluons that appear in our equations\n\n1:25:29.300 --> 1:25:33.340\n don't appear directly as particles you can isolate\n\n1:25:33.340 --> 1:25:35.720\n and study individually.\n\n1:25:35.720 --> 1:25:40.720\n They always occur within what are called bound states\n\n1:25:41.820 --> 1:25:43.980\n or structures like protons.\n\n1:25:43.980 --> 1:25:48.060\n A proton, roughly speaking, is composed of three quarks\n\n1:25:48.060 --> 1:25:50.620\n and a lot of gluons but we can detect them\n\n1:25:50.620 --> 1:25:54.420\n in a remarkably direct way actually nowadays,\n\n1:25:54.420 --> 1:25:57.280\n whereas at relatively low energies,\n\n1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:00.820\n the behavior of quarks is complicated.\n\n1:26:00.820 --> 1:26:05.500\n At high energies, they can propagate through space\n\n1:26:05.500 --> 1:26:10.500\n relatively freely for a while and we can see their tracks.\n\n1:26:11.740 --> 1:26:14.820\n So ultimately, they get recaptured into protons\n\n1:26:14.820 --> 1:26:17.940\n and other mesons and funny things\n\n1:26:17.940 --> 1:26:21.020\n but for a short time, they propagate freely\n\n1:26:21.020 --> 1:26:25.260\n and while that happens, we can take snapshots\n\n1:26:25.260 --> 1:26:27.440\n and see their manifestations.\n\n1:26:29.620 --> 1:26:31.700\n Actually, this kind of thing is exactly\n\n1:26:31.700 --> 1:26:33.140\n what I got the Nobel Prize for,\n\n1:26:33.140 --> 1:26:35.060\n predicting that this would work.\n\n1:26:35.060 --> 1:26:36.540\n And similarly for gluons,\n\n1:26:36.540 --> 1:26:41.540\n although you can't isolate them as individual particles\n\n1:26:41.660 --> 1:26:43.900\n and study them in the same way that we study electrons,\n\n1:26:43.900 --> 1:26:48.900\n say, you can use them theoretically as entities\n\n1:26:51.820 --> 1:26:54.820\n out of which you build tangible things\n\n1:26:57.060 --> 1:26:58.500\n that we actually do observe\n\n1:26:59.560 --> 1:27:03.820\n but also you can, at accelerators at high energy,\n\n1:27:03.820 --> 1:27:06.340\n you can liberate them for brief periods of time\n\n1:27:06.340 --> 1:27:10.860\n and study and get convincing evidence\n\n1:27:10.860 --> 1:27:15.460\n that they leave tracks and you can get convincing evidence\n\n1:27:15.460 --> 1:27:17.900\n that they were there and have the properties\n\n1:27:17.900 --> 1:27:19.580\n that we wanted them to have.\n\n1:27:19.580 --> 1:27:21.260\n Can we talk about asymptotic freedom,\n\n1:27:21.260 --> 1:27:24.020\n this very idea that you won the Nobel Prize for?\n\n1:27:24.020 --> 1:27:25.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:25.300 --> 1:27:29.660\n So it describes a very weird effect to me,\n\n1:27:30.820 --> 1:27:33.220\n the weird in the following way.\n\n1:27:33.220 --> 1:27:38.220\n So the way I think of most forces or interactions,\n\n1:27:38.220 --> 1:27:43.220\n the closer you are, the stronger the effect,\n\n1:27:43.820 --> 1:27:46.300\n the stronger the force, right?\n\n1:27:46.300 --> 1:27:50.540\n With quarks, the close they are,\n\n1:27:50.540 --> 1:27:53.900\n the less so the strong interaction.\n\n1:27:53.900 --> 1:27:58.600\n And in fact, they're basically act like free particles\n\n1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:00.700\n when they're very close.\n\n1:28:00.700 --> 1:28:01.900\n That's right, yes.\n\n1:28:01.900 --> 1:28:04.540\n But this requires a huge amount of energy.\n\n1:28:04.540 --> 1:28:09.540\n Like can you describe me why, how does this even work?\n\n1:28:11.740 --> 1:28:12.580\n How weird it is?\n\n1:28:12.580 --> 1:28:17.580\n A proper description must bring in quantum mechanics\n\n1:28:18.220 --> 1:28:20.620\n and relativity and it's,\n\n1:28:21.660 --> 1:28:25.460\n so a proper description and equations,\n\n1:28:25.460 --> 1:28:29.860\n so a proper description really is probably more\n\n1:28:29.860 --> 1:28:34.140\n than we have time for and require quite a bit of patience\n\n1:28:34.140 --> 1:28:35.980\n on your part, but.\n\n1:28:35.980 --> 1:28:37.700\n How does relativity come into play?\n\n1:28:37.700 --> 1:28:39.220\n Wait, wait a minute.\n\n1:28:39.220 --> 1:28:44.220\n Relativity is important because when we talk about\n\n1:28:48.980 --> 1:28:51.580\n trying to think about short distances,\n\n1:28:51.580 --> 1:28:55.060\n we have to think about very large momenta\n\n1:28:55.060 --> 1:28:56.580\n and very large momenta are connected\n\n1:28:56.580 --> 1:28:59.180\n to very large energy in relativity.\n\n1:28:59.180 --> 1:29:02.460\n And so the connection between how things behave\n\n1:29:02.460 --> 1:29:06.180\n at short distances and how things behave at high energy\n\n1:29:06.180 --> 1:29:09.340\n really is connected through relativity\n\n1:29:09.340 --> 1:29:13.000\n in sort of a slightly backhanded way.\n\n1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:16.180\n Quantum mechanics indicates that short,\n\n1:29:16.180 --> 1:29:18.980\n to get to analyze short distances,\n\n1:29:20.120 --> 1:29:25.120\n you need to bring in probes that carry a lot of momentum.\n\n1:29:26.460 --> 1:29:29.140\n This again is related to uncertainty\n\n1:29:29.140 --> 1:29:31.980\n because it's the fact that you have to bring in\n\n1:29:31.980 --> 1:29:36.060\n a lot of momentum that interferes with the possibility\n\n1:29:36.060 --> 1:29:40.220\n of determining position and momentum at the same time.\n\n1:29:40.220 --> 1:29:41.980\n If you want to determine position,\n\n1:29:41.980 --> 1:29:45.140\n you have to use instruments that bring in a lot of momentum.\n\n1:29:45.140 --> 1:29:48.580\n And because of that, those same instruments\n\n1:29:48.580 --> 1:29:50.060\n can't also measure momentum\n\n1:29:50.060 --> 1:29:52.460\n because they're disturbing the momentum that,\n\n1:29:53.620 --> 1:29:56.220\n and then the momentum brings in energy and yeah.\n\n1:29:56.220 --> 1:29:59.540\n So that there's also the effect that asymptotic freedom\n\n1:29:59.540 --> 1:30:04.540\n comes from the possibility of spontaneously making\n\n1:30:08.460 --> 1:30:12.140\n quarks and gluons for short amounts of time\n\n1:30:12.140 --> 1:30:15.480\n that fluctuate into existence and out of existence.\n\n1:30:16.600 --> 1:30:21.600\n And the fact that that can be done\n\n1:30:21.860 --> 1:30:23.800\n with a very little amount of energy\n\n1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:26.660\n and uncertainty and energy translates\n\n1:30:26.660 --> 1:30:27.620\n into uncertainty and time.\n\n1:30:27.620 --> 1:30:31.460\n So if you do that for a short time, you can do that.\n\n1:30:31.460 --> 1:30:34.040\n Well, it's all comes in a package.\n\n1:30:35.340 --> 1:30:39.500\n So I told you it would take a while to really explain,\n\n1:30:39.500 --> 1:30:44.100\n but the results can be understood.\n\n1:30:44.100 --> 1:30:48.100\n I mean, we can state the results pretty simply, I think.\n\n1:30:48.100 --> 1:30:53.100\n So in everyday life, we do encounter some forces\n\n1:30:53.100 --> 1:30:56.380\n that increase with distance\n\n1:30:56.380 --> 1:30:59.320\n and kind of turn off at short distances.\n\n1:30:59.320 --> 1:31:02.140\n That's the way rubber bands work, if you think about it,\n\n1:31:02.140 --> 1:31:06.980\n or if you pull them hard, they resist,\n\n1:31:06.980 --> 1:31:11.620\n but they get flabby if the rubber band is not pulled.\n\n1:31:12.940 --> 1:31:17.660\n And so there are, that can happen in the physical world,\n\n1:31:17.660 --> 1:31:19.860\n but what's really difficult is to see\n\n1:31:19.860 --> 1:31:21.820\n how that could be a fundamental force\n\n1:31:21.820 --> 1:31:24.400\n that's consistent with everything else we know.\n\n1:31:24.400 --> 1:31:28.500\n And that's what asymptotic freedom is.\n\n1:31:28.500 --> 1:31:33.500\n It says that there's a very particular kind\n\n1:31:33.620 --> 1:31:37.480\n of fundamental force that involves special particles\n\n1:31:37.480 --> 1:31:40.340\n called gluons with very special properties\n\n1:31:40.340 --> 1:31:43.080\n that enables that kind of behavior.\n\n1:31:43.080 --> 1:31:47.380\n So there were experiment, at the time we did our work,\n\n1:31:47.380 --> 1:31:49.300\n there were experimental indications\n\n1:31:49.300 --> 1:31:54.180\n that quarks and gluons did have this kind of property,\n\n1:31:54.180 --> 1:31:56.780\n but there were no equations\n\n1:31:56.780 --> 1:31:59.600\n that were capable of capturing it.\n\n1:31:59.600 --> 1:32:02.580\n And we found the equations and showed how they work\n\n1:32:02.580 --> 1:32:06.240\n and showed how they, that they were basically unique.\n\n1:32:06.240 --> 1:32:08.300\n And this led to a complete theory\n\n1:32:08.300 --> 1:32:09.980\n of how the strong interaction works,\n\n1:32:09.980 --> 1:32:14.220\n which is the quantum chromodynamics we mentioned earlier.\n\n1:32:14.220 --> 1:32:19.220\n And so that's the phenomenon that quarks and gluons\n\n1:32:23.140 --> 1:32:26.500\n interact very, very weakly when they're close together.\n\n1:32:26.500 --> 1:32:29.100\n That's connected through relativity\n\n1:32:29.100 --> 1:32:32.520\n with the fact that they also interact very, very weakly\n\n1:32:32.520 --> 1:32:34.000\n at high energies.\n\n1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:36.680\n So if you have, so at high energies,\n\n1:32:37.740 --> 1:32:42.220\n the simplicity of the fundamental interaction gets revealed.\n\n1:32:42.220 --> 1:32:43.820\n At the time we did our work,\n\n1:32:43.820 --> 1:32:46.580\n the clues were very subtle,\n\n1:32:46.580 --> 1:32:50.140\n but nowadays at what are now high energy accelerators,\n\n1:32:50.140 --> 1:32:51.100\n it's all obvious.\n\n1:32:51.100 --> 1:32:52.900\n So we would have had a much,\n\n1:32:52.900 --> 1:32:55.540\n well, somebody would have had a much easier time\n\n1:32:55.540 --> 1:32:57.700\n 20 years later, looking at the data,\n\n1:32:57.700 --> 1:32:59.940\n you can sort of see the quarks and gluons.\n\n1:32:59.940 --> 1:33:02.140\n As I mentioned, they leave these short tracks\n\n1:33:02.140 --> 1:33:04.380\n that would have been much, much easier,\n\n1:33:04.380 --> 1:33:08.700\n but from fundamental, from indirect clues,\n\n1:33:08.700 --> 1:33:10.260\n we were able to piece together enough\n\n1:33:10.260 --> 1:33:13.240\n to make that behavior a prediction\n\n1:33:13.240 --> 1:33:15.900\n rather than a post diction, right?\n\n1:33:15.900 --> 1:33:17.960\n So it becomes obvious at high energies.\n\n1:33:17.960 --> 1:33:19.240\n It becomes very obvious.\n\n1:33:19.240 --> 1:33:21.560\n When we first did this work,\n\n1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:24.820\n it was frontiers of high energy physics\n\n1:33:24.820 --> 1:33:27.780\n and at big international conferences,\n\n1:33:27.780 --> 1:33:30.900\n there would always be sessions on testing QCD\n\n1:33:30.900 --> 1:33:34.380\n and whether this proposed description\n\n1:33:34.380 --> 1:33:37.660\n of the strong interaction was in fact correct and so forth.\n\n1:33:37.660 --> 1:33:39.740\n And it was very exciting.\n\n1:33:39.740 --> 1:33:44.740\n But nowadays the same kind of work,\n\n1:33:44.740 --> 1:33:48.920\n but much more precise with calculations\n\n1:33:48.920 --> 1:33:50.700\n to more accuracy and experiments\n\n1:33:50.700 --> 1:33:53.500\n that are much more precise\n\n1:33:54.380 --> 1:33:57.160\n and comparisons that are very precise.\n\n1:33:57.160 --> 1:33:59.100\n Now it's called calculating backgrounds\n\n1:33:59.100 --> 1:34:03.040\n because people take this for granted\n\n1:34:03.040 --> 1:34:06.660\n and wanna see deviations from the theory,\n\n1:34:06.660 --> 1:34:09.740\n which would be the new discoveries.\n\n1:34:09.740 --> 1:34:11.700\n Yeah, the cutting edge becomes a foundation\n\n1:34:11.700 --> 1:34:13.100\n and the foundation becomes boring.\n\n1:34:13.100 --> 1:34:13.940\n Yes.\n\n1:34:15.340 --> 1:34:19.100\n Is there some, for basic explanation purposes,\n\n1:34:19.100 --> 1:34:23.300\n is there something to be said about strong interactions\n\n1:34:23.300 --> 1:34:26.260\n in the context of the strong nuclear force\n\n1:34:26.260 --> 1:34:30.800\n for the attraction between protons and neutrons\n\n1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:35.340\n versus the interaction between quarks within protons?\n\n1:34:35.340 --> 1:34:40.340\n Well, quarks and gluons have the same relation\n\n1:34:40.620 --> 1:34:43.700\n basically to nuclear physics\n\n1:34:43.700 --> 1:34:46.700\n as electrons and photons have\n\n1:34:46.700 --> 1:34:49.780\n to atomic and molecular physics.\n\n1:34:49.780 --> 1:34:54.780\n So atoms and photons are the dynamic entities\n\n1:34:56.780 --> 1:35:01.580\n that really come into play in chemistry and atomic physics.\n\n1:35:01.580 --> 1:35:03.220\n Of course, you have to have the atomic nuclei,\n\n1:35:03.220 --> 1:35:07.060\n but those are small and relatively inert,\n\n1:35:07.060 --> 1:35:09.440\n really the dynamical part.\n\n1:35:09.440 --> 1:35:12.100\n And for most purposes of chemistry,\n\n1:35:12.100 --> 1:35:14.200\n you just say that you have this tiny little nucleus,\n\n1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:17.120\n which QCD gives you.\n\n1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:17.960\n Don't worry about it.\n\n1:35:17.960 --> 1:35:19.700\n It just, it's there.\n\n1:35:19.700 --> 1:35:22.660\n The real action is the electrons moving around\n\n1:35:22.660 --> 1:35:24.460\n and exchanging and things like that.\n\n1:35:26.900 --> 1:35:29.340\n Okay, but we want it to understand the nucleus too.\n\n1:35:29.340 --> 1:35:34.340\n And so atoms are sort of quantum mechanical clouds\n\n1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.880\n of electrons held together by electrical forces,\n\n1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:39.780\n which is photons.\n\n1:35:39.780 --> 1:35:40.820\n And then this radiation,\n\n1:35:40.820 --> 1:35:43.300\n which is another aspect of photons.\n\n1:35:43.300 --> 1:35:44.560\n That's where all the fun happens\n\n1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:45.900\n is the electrons and the photons.\n\n1:35:45.900 --> 1:35:47.000\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:49.160\n And the nucleus are kind of the,\n\n1:35:51.180 --> 1:35:53.920\n well, they give the positive charge\n\n1:35:53.920 --> 1:35:55.760\n and most of the mass of matter,\n\n1:35:55.760 --> 1:36:00.760\n but they don't, since they're so heavy,\n\n1:36:01.180 --> 1:36:03.800\n they don't move very much in chemistry.\n\n1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:07.920\n And I'm oversimplifying drastically.\n\n1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:12.240\n They're not contributing much to the interaction in chemistry.\n\n1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:13.680\n For most purposes in chemistry,\n\n1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:16.120\n you can just idealize them as concentrations\n\n1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:18.720\n of positive mass and charge that are,\n\n1:36:20.720 --> 1:36:22.120\n you don't have to look inside,\n\n1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:24.260\n but people are curious what's inside.\n\n1:36:24.260 --> 1:36:29.260\n And that was a big thing on the agenda\n\n1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:32.520\n of 20th century physics starting in the 19,\n\n1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:34.520\n well, starting with the 20th century\n\n1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:38.240\n and unfolding throughout of trying to understand\n\n1:36:38.240 --> 1:36:41.600\n what forces held the atomic nucleus together,\n\n1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:42.700\n what it was and so.\n\n1:36:44.640 --> 1:36:49.640\n Anyway, the story that emerges from QCD\n\n1:36:49.640 --> 1:36:54.640\n is that very similar to the way that,\n\n1:36:55.560 --> 1:36:57.120\n well, broadly similar to the way\n\n1:36:57.120 --> 1:37:01.080\n that clouds of electrons held together\n\n1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:04.480\n by electrical forces give you atoms\n\n1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:07.320\n and ultimately molecules.\n\n1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:13.740\n Protons and neutrons are like atoms\n\n1:37:13.740 --> 1:37:17.820\n made now out of quarks, quark clouds held together\n\n1:37:17.820 --> 1:37:20.960\n by gluons, which are like the photons\n\n1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:23.580\n that give the electric forces,\n\n1:37:23.580 --> 1:37:26.480\n but this is giving a different force, the strong force.\n\n1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:31.480\n And the residual forces between protons and neutrons\n\n1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:36.800\n that are leftover from the basic binding\n\n1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:40.120\n are like the residual forces between atoms\n\n1:37:40.120 --> 1:37:43.560\n that give molecules, but in the case of protons and neutrons,\n\n1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:45.400\n it gives you atomic nuclei.\n\n1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:48.400\n So again, for definitional purposes,\n\n1:37:48.400 --> 1:37:51.000\n QCD, quantum chromodynamics,\n\n1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:54.040\n is basically the physics of strong interaction.\n\n1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:56.580\n Yeah, we understand, we now would understand,\n\n1:37:56.580 --> 1:37:58.680\n I think most physicists would say\n\n1:37:58.680 --> 1:38:02.000\n it's the theory of quarks and gluons\n\n1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:03.160\n and how they interact.\n\n1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:07.840\n But it's a very precise, and I think it's fair to say,\n\n1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:11.920\n very beautiful theory based on mathematical symmetry\n\n1:38:11.920 --> 1:38:16.600\n of a high order, and another thing that's beautiful\n\n1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:19.200\n about it is that it's kind of\n\n1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:26.280\n in the same family as electrodynamics.\n\n1:38:26.280 --> 1:38:31.200\n The conceptual structure of the equations are very similar.\n\n1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:34.880\n They're based on having particles that respond to charge\n\n1:38:34.880 --> 1:38:37.160\n in a very symmetric way.\n\n1:38:37.160 --> 1:38:39.660\n In the case of electrodynamics,\n\n1:38:39.660 --> 1:38:42.040\n it's photons that respond to electric charge.\n\n1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:44.520\n In the case of quantum chromodynamics,\n\n1:38:44.520 --> 1:38:47.520\n there are three kinds of charge that we call colors,\n\n1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:49.320\n but they're nothing like colors.\n\n1:38:49.320 --> 1:38:51.900\n They really are like different kinds of charge.\n\n1:38:51.900 --> 1:38:54.560\n But they rhyme with the same kind of,\n\n1:38:54.560 --> 1:38:56.600\n like it's similar kind of dynamics.\n\n1:38:56.600 --> 1:38:57.920\n Similar kind of dynamics.\n\n1:38:57.920 --> 1:39:02.920\n I'd like to say that QCD is like QED on steroids.\n\n1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:05.920\n And instead of one photon, you have eight gluons.\n\n1:39:05.920 --> 1:39:09.200\n Instead of one charge, you have three color charges.\n\n1:39:09.200 --> 1:39:13.120\n But there's a strong family resemblance between them.\n\n1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:16.880\n But the context in which QCD does this thing\n\n1:39:16.880 --> 1:39:19.360\n is it's much higher energies.\n\n1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:20.480\n Like that's where it comes to life.\n\n1:39:20.480 --> 1:39:22.320\n Well, it's a stronger force,\n\n1:39:22.320 --> 1:39:27.320\n so that to access how it works and kind of pry things apart,\n\n1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:30.360\n you have to inject more energy.\n\n1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:35.320\n And so that gives us, in some sense,\n\n1:39:35.320 --> 1:39:39.440\n a hint of how things were in the earlier universe.\n\n1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:41.120\n Yeah, well, in that regard,\n\n1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:43.760\n asymptotic freedom is a tremendous blessing\n\n1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:48.280\n because it means things get simpler at high energy.\n\n1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:50.040\n The universe was born free.\n\n1:39:50.040 --> 1:39:50.880\n Born free.\n\n1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:52.640\n That's very good, yes.\n\n1:39:52.640 --> 1:39:53.560\n Universe was born.\n\n1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:56.560\n So in atomic physics,\n\n1:39:56.560 --> 1:39:59.360\n a similar thing happens in the theory of stars.\n\n1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:03.380\n Stars are hot enough that the interactions\n\n1:40:03.380 --> 1:40:07.520\n between electrons and photons, they're liberated.\n\n1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:08.680\n They don't form atoms anymore.\n\n1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:09.640\n They make a plasma,\n\n1:40:09.640 --> 1:40:12.320\n which in some ways is simpler to understand.\n\n1:40:12.320 --> 1:40:14.640\n You don't have complicated chemistry.\n\n1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:18.120\n And in the early universe, according to QCD,\n\n1:40:18.120 --> 1:40:20.480\n similarly atomic nuclei dissolved\n\n1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:22.880\n and take the constituent quarks and gluons,\n\n1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:24.480\n which are moving around very fast\n\n1:40:24.480 --> 1:40:27.020\n and interacting in relatively simple ways.\n\n1:40:27.020 --> 1:40:30.560\n And so this opened up the early universe\n\n1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:33.560\n to scientific calculation.\n\n1:40:33.560 --> 1:40:35.840\n Can I ask you about some other weird particles\n\n1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:37.920\n that make up our universe?\n\n1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:39.740\n What are axions?\n\n1:40:39.740 --> 1:40:42.640\n And what is the strong CP problem?\n\n1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:47.640\n Okay, so let me start with what the strong CP problem is.\n\n1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:53.720\n First of all, well, C is charge conjugation,\n\n1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:57.600\n which is the transformation,\n\n1:40:57.600 --> 1:40:59.940\n the notional transformation, if you like,\n\n1:40:59.940 --> 1:41:03.360\n that changes all particles into their antiparticles.\n\n1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:08.360\n And the concept of C symmetry,\n\n1:41:09.140 --> 1:41:12.240\n charge conjugation symmetry, is that if you do that,\n\n1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:15.440\n you find the same laws that would work.\n\n1:41:16.760 --> 1:41:20.720\n So the laws are symmetric if the behavior\n\n1:41:20.720 --> 1:41:22.800\n that particles exhibit is the same\n\n1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:27.160\n as the behavior you get with all their antiparticles.\n\n1:41:27.160 --> 1:41:31.360\n And then P is parity,\n\n1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:35.260\n which is also called spatial inversion.\n\n1:41:35.260 --> 1:41:39.040\n It's basically looking at a mirror universe\n\n1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:41.960\n and saying that the laws that are obeyed\n\n1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:44.160\n in a mirror universe, when you look,\n\n1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:46.780\n that the mirror images obey the same laws\n\n1:41:46.780 --> 1:41:50.480\n as the sources of their images.\n\n1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:52.840\n There's no way of telling left from right, for instance,\n\n1:41:52.840 --> 1:41:55.640\n that the laws don't distinguish between left and right.\n\n1:41:55.640 --> 1:42:00.380\n Now, in the mid 20th century,\n\n1:42:00.380 --> 1:42:03.620\n people discovered that both of those are not quite true.\n\n1:42:05.160 --> 1:42:08.960\n Really, the equation that the mirror universe,\n\n1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:13.960\n the universe that you see in a mirror\n\n1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:18.480\n is not gonna obey the same laws\n\n1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:23.480\n as the universe that we actually interpret.\n\n1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:26.880\n You would be able to tell\n\n1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:28.980\n if you did the right kind of experiments,\n\n1:42:28.980 --> 1:42:31.520\n which was the mirror and which was the real thing.\n\n1:42:33.700 --> 1:42:34.840\n Anyway, that.\n\n1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:36.080\n That's the parity and they show\n\n1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:37.920\n that the parity doesn't necessarily hold.\n\n1:42:37.920 --> 1:42:39.080\n It doesn't quite hold.\n\n1:42:41.200 --> 1:42:45.680\n Examining what the exceptions are turned out to be,\n\n1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:47.400\n to lead to all kinds of insight\n\n1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:49.840\n about the nature of fundamental interactions,\n\n1:42:49.840 --> 1:42:51.640\n especially properties of neutrinos\n\n1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:53.840\n and the weak interaction, it's a long story.\n\n1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:55.480\n But it's a very, it's a.\n\n1:42:55.480 --> 1:42:57.680\n So you just define the C and the P,\n\n1:42:57.680 --> 1:42:59.480\n the conjugation, the charge conjugation.\n\n1:42:59.480 --> 1:43:00.880\n Now that I've done that, I wanna.\n\n1:43:00.880 --> 1:43:01.720\n What's the problem?\n\n1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:02.560\n Shove them off.\n\n1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:04.040\n Okay, great.\n\n1:43:04.040 --> 1:43:06.520\n Because it's easier to talk about T,\n\n1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:08.920\n which is time reversal symmetry.\n\n1:43:08.920 --> 1:43:13.200\n We have very good reasons to think CPT\n\n1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:17.180\n is an accurate symmetry of nature.\n\n1:43:17.180 --> 1:43:19.400\n It's on the same level as relativity\n\n1:43:19.400 --> 1:43:20.960\n and quantum mechanics, basically.\n\n1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:22.600\n So that better be true.\n\n1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:24.800\n Or else we.\n\n1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:26.000\n So it's symmetric when you.\n\n1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:26.840\n When you do.\n\n1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:28.000\n When you do conjugation parity and time.\n\n1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:30.960\n And time and space reversal.\n\n1:43:30.960 --> 1:43:32.320\n If you do all three,\n\n1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:35.320\n then you get the same physical consequences.\n\n1:43:35.320 --> 1:43:39.700\n Now, so, but that means that CP is equivalent to T.\n\n1:43:39.700 --> 1:43:41.640\n But what's observed in the world\n\n1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:45.640\n is that T is not quite an accurate symmetry of nature,\n\n1:43:45.640 --> 1:43:46.720\n either.\n\n1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:51.720\n So most phenomena of, at the fundamental level.\n\n1:43:52.320 --> 1:43:54.700\n So interactions among elementary particles\n\n1:43:54.700 --> 1:43:57.540\n and the basic gravitational interaction.\n\n1:43:59.240 --> 1:44:02.420\n If you ran them backwards in time,\n\n1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:05.400\n you'd get the same laws.\n\n1:44:05.400 --> 1:44:08.920\n So if, again, going back.\n\n1:44:08.920 --> 1:44:11.500\n This time we don't talk about a mirror,\n\n1:44:11.500 --> 1:44:13.220\n but we talk about a movie.\n\n1:44:13.220 --> 1:44:17.940\n If you take a movie and then run it backwards,\n\n1:44:18.820 --> 1:44:20.340\n that's the time reversal.\n\n1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:23.400\n It's good to think about a mirror in time.\n\n1:44:23.400 --> 1:44:25.220\n Yeah, it's like a mirror in time.\n\n1:44:25.220 --> 1:44:29.120\n If you run the movie backwards,\n\n1:44:29.120 --> 1:44:30.680\n it would look very strange\n\n1:44:30.680 --> 1:44:32.800\n if you were looking at complicated objects\n\n1:44:32.800 --> 1:44:37.360\n and a Charlie Chaplin movie or whatever.\n\n1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:40.240\n It would look very strange if you ran it backwards in time.\n\n1:44:40.240 --> 1:44:43.800\n But at the level of basic interactions,\n\n1:44:43.800 --> 1:44:46.000\n if you were able to look at the atoms\n\n1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:49.960\n and the quarks involved, they would obey the same laws.\n\n1:44:49.960 --> 1:44:53.360\n They do a very good approximation, but not exactly.\n\n1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:55.960\n So this is not exactly, that means you could tell.\n\n1:44:55.960 --> 1:44:59.800\n You could tell, but you'd have to do very, very\n\n1:44:59.800 --> 1:45:04.680\n subtle experiments with at high energy accelerators\n\n1:45:04.680 --> 1:45:06.760\n to take a movie that looked different\n\n1:45:06.760 --> 1:45:08.760\n when you ran it backwards.\n\n1:45:08.760 --> 1:45:13.760\n This was a discovery by two great physicists\n\n1:45:13.800 --> 1:45:18.800\n named Jim Cronin and Val Fitch in the mid 1960s.\n\n1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:22.520\n Previous to that, over all the centuries\n\n1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:25.260\n of development of physics with all its precise laws,\n\n1:45:25.260 --> 1:45:28.920\n they did seem to have this gratuitous property\n\n1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:33.040\n that they look the same if you run the equations backwards.\n\n1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:35.320\n It's kind of an embarrassing property actually\n\n1:45:35.320 --> 1:45:38.560\n because life isn't like that.\n\n1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:41.880\n So empirical reality does not have this imagery\n\n1:45:41.880 --> 1:45:42.900\n in any obvious way.\n\n1:45:42.900 --> 1:45:44.960\n And yet the laws did.\n\n1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:46.320\n It's almost like the laws of physics\n\n1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:48.740\n are missing something fundamental about life\n\n1:45:48.740 --> 1:45:51.400\n if it holds that property, right?\n\n1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:54.360\n Well, that's the embarrassing nature of it.\n\n1:45:54.360 --> 1:45:55.240\n Yeah, it's embarrassing.\n\n1:45:55.240 --> 1:46:00.240\n Well, people worked hard at what's,\n\n1:46:01.080 --> 1:46:04.840\n this is a problem that's thought to belong\n\n1:46:04.840 --> 1:46:07.160\n to the foundations of statistical mechanics\n\n1:46:07.160 --> 1:46:10.560\n or the foundations of thermodynamics\n\n1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:14.960\n to understand how behavior,\n\n1:46:14.960 --> 1:46:18.780\n which is grossly not symmetric\n\n1:46:18.780 --> 1:46:21.280\n with respect to reversing the direction of time\n\n1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:24.360\n in large objects, how that can emerge from equations\n\n1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:28.120\n which are symmetric with respect to changing\n\n1:46:28.120 --> 1:46:31.080\n the direction of time to a very good approximation.\n\n1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:33.200\n And that's still an interesting endeavor.\n\n1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:35.200\n That's interesting.\n\n1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:38.640\n And actually it's an exciting frontier of physics now\n\n1:46:38.640 --> 1:46:40.200\n to sort of explore the boundary\n\n1:46:40.200 --> 1:46:42.360\n between when that's true and when it's not true.\n\n1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:44.520\n When you get to smaller objects\n\n1:46:44.520 --> 1:46:46.680\n and exceptions like time crystals.\n\n1:46:47.600 --> 1:46:49.480\n I definitely have to ask you about time crystals\n\n1:46:49.480 --> 1:46:50.320\n in a second here.\n\n1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:53.680\n But so the CP problem and T,\n\n1:46:53.680 --> 1:46:55.680\n so there's all of these.\n\n1:46:55.680 --> 1:46:57.580\n We're in danger of infinite regress,\n\n1:46:57.580 --> 1:46:59.240\n but we have to convert soon.\n\n1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:00.080\n So.\n\n1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:02.160\n Can't possibly be turtles all the way down.\n\n1:47:02.160 --> 1:47:03.440\n We're gonna get to the bottom turtle.\n\n1:47:03.440 --> 1:47:06.280\n So it became,\n\n1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:08.880\n so it got to be a real,\n\n1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:11.200\n I mean, it's a really puzzling thing\n\n1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:15.340\n why the laws should have this very odd property\n\n1:47:15.340 --> 1:47:16.840\n that we don't need.\n\n1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:20.000\n And in fact, it's kind of an embarrassment\n\n1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:22.180\n in addressing empirical reality.\n\n1:47:22.180 --> 1:47:24.680\n But it seemed to be almost,\n\n1:47:24.680 --> 1:47:26.960\n it seemed to be exactly true for a long time.\n\n1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:29.280\n And then almost true.\n\n1:47:29.280 --> 1:47:33.760\n And in way, almost true is even,\n\n1:47:33.760 --> 1:47:35.600\n is more disturbing than exactly true\n\n1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:37.400\n because exactly true,\n\n1:47:37.400 --> 1:47:39.800\n it could have been just a fundamental feature of the world.\n\n1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:42.300\n And at some level you just have to take it as it is.\n\n1:47:42.300 --> 1:47:47.300\n And if it's a beautiful, easily articulatable regularity,\n\n1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:48.700\n you could say that, okay,\n\n1:47:48.700 --> 1:47:51.760\n that's fine as a fundamental law of nature.\n\n1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:53.440\n But to say that it's approximately true,\n\n1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:56.400\n but not exactly, that's weird.\n\n1:47:56.400 --> 1:48:00.920\n So, and then, so there was great progress\n\n1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:05.220\n in the late part of the 20th century\n\n1:48:06.860 --> 1:48:09.260\n in getting to an understanding\n\n1:48:09.260 --> 1:48:11.680\n of fundamental interactions in general\n\n1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:13.680\n that shed light on this issue.\n\n1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:19.800\n It turns out that the basic principles of relativity\n\n1:48:20.900 --> 1:48:22.240\n and quantum mechanics,\n\n1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:27.240\n plus the kind of high degree of symmetry that we found,\n\n1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:28.960\n the so called gauge symmetry\n\n1:48:28.960 --> 1:48:31.980\n that characterizes the fundamental interactions,\n\n1:48:31.980 --> 1:48:33.800\n when you put all that together,\n\n1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:36.560\n it's a very, very constraining framework.\n\n1:48:37.620 --> 1:48:40.560\n And it has some indirect consequences\n\n1:48:42.500 --> 1:48:45.960\n because the possible interactions are so constrained.\n\n1:48:45.960 --> 1:48:48.640\n And one of the indirect consequences\n\n1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:53.640\n is that the possibilities for violating the symmetry\n\n1:48:54.360 --> 1:48:57.920\n between forwards and backwards in time are very limited.\n\n1:48:57.920 --> 1:48:59.400\n They're basically only two.\n\n1:49:01.040 --> 1:49:05.120\n And one of them occurs and leads to a very rich theory\n\n1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:07.600\n that explains the Cronin Fish experiment\n\n1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:09.700\n and a lot of things that have been done subsequently\n\n1:49:09.700 --> 1:49:13.680\n has been used to make all kinds of successful predictions.\n\n1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:18.680\n So that's turned out to be a very rich interaction.\n\n1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:23.160\n It's esoteric and the effects only show up at accelerators\n\n1:49:23.160 --> 1:49:24.360\n and are small and so on,\n\n1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:26.480\n but they might've been very important in the early universe\n\n1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:29.760\n and lead to them be connected to the asymmetry\n\n1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:32.560\n between matter and antimatter in the present universe.\n\n1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:35.420\n And so, but that's another digression.\n\n1:49:36.380 --> 1:49:40.080\n The point is that that was fine.\n\n1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:41.620\n That was a triumph to say\n\n1:49:41.620 --> 1:49:44.920\n that there was one possible kind of interaction\n\n1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:47.320\n that would violate time reversal symmetry.\n\n1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:49.500\n And sure enough, there it is.\n\n1:49:49.500 --> 1:49:54.500\n But the other kind doesn't occur.\n\n1:49:54.760 --> 1:49:55.920\n So we still got a problem.\n\n1:49:55.920 --> 1:49:57.040\n Why doesn't it occur?\n\n1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:01.800\n So we're close to really finally understanding\n\n1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:04.760\n this profound gratuitous feature of the world\n\n1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:08.380\n that is almost but not quite symmetric\n\n1:50:08.380 --> 1:50:12.240\n under reversing the direction of time, but not quite there.\n\n1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:17.080\n And to understand that last bit\n\n1:50:18.520 --> 1:50:21.820\n is a challenging frontier of physics today.\n\n1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:27.520\n And we have a promising proposal for how it works,\n\n1:50:27.520 --> 1:50:29.940\n which is a kind of theory of evolution.\n\n1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:35.600\n So there's this possible interaction,\n\n1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:37.320\n which we call a coupling,\n\n1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:39.120\n and there's a numerical quantity\n\n1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:41.480\n that tells us how strong that is.\n\n1:50:41.480 --> 1:50:43.640\n And traditionally in physics,\n\n1:50:43.640 --> 1:50:46.400\n we think of these kinds of numerical quantities\n\n1:50:46.400 --> 1:50:51.400\n as constants of nature that you just have to put them in.\n\n1:50:54.220 --> 1:50:57.040\n From experiment, they have a certain value and that's it.\n\n1:50:57.040 --> 1:51:01.760\n And who am I to question what God doing?\n\n1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:02.720\n They're just constant.\n\n1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:04.620\n Well, they seem to be just constants.\n\n1:51:04.620 --> 1:51:06.060\n I'm just wondering.\n\n1:51:06.060 --> 1:51:10.340\n But in this case,\n\n1:51:10.340 --> 1:51:15.140\n it's been fruitful to think and work out a theory\n\n1:51:15.140 --> 1:51:20.140\n where that strength of interaction\n\n1:51:22.260 --> 1:51:23.900\n is actually not a constant.\n\n1:51:23.900 --> 1:51:27.220\n It's a fun, it's a field.\n\n1:51:27.220 --> 1:51:31.560\n It's a, fields are the fundamental ingredients\n\n1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:32.420\n of modern physics.\n\n1:51:32.420 --> 1:51:34.060\n Like there's an electron field,\n\n1:51:34.060 --> 1:51:35.180\n there's a photon field,\n\n1:51:35.180 --> 1:51:37.180\n which is also called the electromagnetic field.\n\n1:51:37.180 --> 1:51:39.240\n And so all of these particles\n\n1:51:39.240 --> 1:51:41.700\n are manifestations of different fields.\n\n1:51:41.700 --> 1:51:45.300\n And there could be a field,\n\n1:51:45.300 --> 1:51:47.740\n something that depends on space and time.\n\n1:51:47.740 --> 1:51:52.740\n So a dynamical entity instead of just a constant here.\n\n1:51:53.100 --> 1:51:57.660\n And if you do things in a nice way,\n\n1:51:57.660 --> 1:51:58.720\n that's very symmetric,\n\n1:51:58.720 --> 1:52:02.200\n very much suggested aesthetically by the theory.\n\n1:52:02.200 --> 1:52:05.160\n But the theory we do have,\n\n1:52:05.160 --> 1:52:10.080\n then you find that you get a field\n\n1:52:11.160 --> 1:52:15.580\n which as it evolves from the early universe,\n\n1:52:17.240 --> 1:52:20.840\n settles down to a value\n\n1:52:22.160 --> 1:52:27.160\n that's just right to make the laws\n\n1:52:27.160 --> 1:52:32.160\n very nearly exact, invariant or symmetric\n\n1:52:32.240 --> 1:52:33.640\n with respect to reversal of time.\n\n1:52:33.640 --> 1:52:34.760\n It might appear as a constant,\n\n1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:36.640\n but it's actually a field that evolved over time.\n\n1:52:36.640 --> 1:52:38.500\n It evolved over time, okay.\n\n1:52:38.500 --> 1:52:42.160\n But when you examine this proposal in detail,\n\n1:52:42.160 --> 1:52:47.160\n you find that it hasn't quite settled down to exactly zero.\n\n1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:48.720\n There it's still,\n\n1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:52.040\n the field is still moving around a little bit.\n\n1:52:52.040 --> 1:52:55.660\n And because the motion is so,\n\n1:52:55.660 --> 1:52:59.460\n the motion is so difficult.\n\n1:52:59.460 --> 1:53:00.820\n The material is so rigid.\n\n1:53:00.820 --> 1:53:01.660\n And this material,\n\n1:53:01.660 --> 1:53:03.980\n the field that fills all space is so rigid.\n\n1:53:03.980 --> 1:53:07.200\n Even small amounts of motion can involve lots of energy.\n\n1:53:08.200 --> 1:53:13.200\n And that energy takes the form of particles,\n\n1:53:14.740 --> 1:53:16.740\n fields that are in motion\n\n1:53:16.740 --> 1:53:18.500\n are always associated with particles.\n\n1:53:18.500 --> 1:53:20.500\n And those are the axioms.\n\n1:53:20.500 --> 1:53:23.380\n And if you calculate how much energy\n\n1:53:23.380 --> 1:53:26.620\n is in these residual oscillations,\n\n1:53:26.620 --> 1:53:30.260\n this axiom gas that fills all the universe,\n\n1:53:30.260 --> 1:53:32.300\n if this fundamental theory is correct,\n\n1:53:32.300 --> 1:53:36.460\n you get just the right amount\n\n1:53:36.460 --> 1:53:39.300\n to make the dark matter that astronomers want.\n\n1:53:39.300 --> 1:53:41.780\n And it has just the right properties.\n\n1:53:41.780 --> 1:53:44.260\n So I'd love to believe that.\n\n1:53:44.260 --> 1:53:47.680\n So that might be a thing that unlocks,\n\n1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:50.180\n might be the key to understanding dark matter.\n\n1:53:50.180 --> 1:53:51.540\n Yeah, I'd like to think so.\n\n1:53:51.540 --> 1:53:53.380\n And many, many physicists are coming around\n\n1:53:53.380 --> 1:53:54.220\n to this point of view,\n\n1:53:54.220 --> 1:53:58.100\n which I've been a voice in the wilderness.\n\n1:53:58.100 --> 1:54:00.620\n I was a voice in the wilderness for a long time,\n\n1:54:00.620 --> 1:54:04.620\n but now it's become very popular, maybe even dominant.\n\n1:54:04.620 --> 1:54:05.460\n So almost like,\n\n1:54:05.460 --> 1:54:10.460\n so this axion particle slash field\n\n1:54:10.660 --> 1:54:13.980\n would be the thing that explains dark matter.\n\n1:54:13.980 --> 1:54:14.820\n It explains, yeah,\n\n1:54:14.820 --> 1:54:17.940\n would solve this fundamental question of finally,\n\n1:54:17.940 --> 1:54:22.940\n of why the laws are almost, but not quite exactly the same\n\n1:54:24.620 --> 1:54:26.540\n if you run them backwards in time.\n\n1:54:26.540 --> 1:54:30.380\n And then seemingly in a totally different\n\n1:54:30.380 --> 1:54:31.880\n conceptual universe,\n\n1:54:32.740 --> 1:54:35.300\n it would also provide,\n\n1:54:35.300 --> 1:54:38.020\n give us an understanding of the dark matter.\n\n1:54:38.020 --> 1:54:41.580\n That's not what it was designed for.\n\n1:54:41.580 --> 1:54:45.060\n And the theory wasn't proposed with that in mind,\n\n1:54:45.060 --> 1:54:47.940\n but when you work out the equations, that's what you get.\n\n1:54:47.940 --> 1:54:49.060\n That's always a good sign.\n\n1:54:49.060 --> 1:54:49.900\n Yes.\n\n1:54:51.020 --> 1:54:53.840\n I think I vaguely read somewhere\n\n1:54:53.840 --> 1:54:58.840\n that there may be early experimental validation of axion.\n\n1:54:59.600 --> 1:55:03.120\n Is that, am I reading the wrong?\n\n1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:05.580\n Well, there've been quite a few false alarms\n\n1:55:05.580 --> 1:55:08.100\n and I think there are some of them still,\n\n1:55:08.100 --> 1:55:10.100\n people desperately wanna find this thing.\n\n1:55:10.100 --> 1:55:15.100\n And, but I don't think any of them are convincing\n\n1:55:15.300 --> 1:55:16.140\n at this point,\n\n1:55:16.140 --> 1:55:20.460\n but there are very ambitious experiments\n\n1:55:20.460 --> 1:55:23.000\n and kind of new,\n\n1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:24.940\n you have to design new kinds of antennas\n\n1:55:24.940 --> 1:55:28.340\n that are capable of detecting these predicted particles.\n\n1:55:28.340 --> 1:55:29.900\n And it's very difficult.\n\n1:55:29.900 --> 1:55:31.380\n They interact very, very weakly.\n\n1:55:31.380 --> 1:55:33.740\n If it were easy, it would have been done already.\n\n1:55:33.740 --> 1:55:37.060\n But I think there's good hope\n\n1:55:37.060 --> 1:55:40.980\n that we can get down to the required sensitivity\n\n1:55:40.980 --> 1:55:43.180\n and actually test whether these ideas are right\n\n1:55:44.740 --> 1:55:47.420\n in coming years or maybe decades.\n\n1:55:47.420 --> 1:55:50.460\n And then understand one of the big mysteries,\n\n1:55:50.460 --> 1:55:53.940\n like literally big in terms of its fraction\n\n1:55:53.940 --> 1:55:55.460\n of the universe is dark matter.\n\n1:55:55.460 --> 1:55:56.620\n Yes.\n\n1:55:56.620 --> 1:55:59.020\n Let me ask you about, you mentioned a few times,\n\n1:55:59.020 --> 1:56:00.020\n time crystals.\n\n1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:02.860\n What are they?\n\n1:56:02.860 --> 1:56:05.340\n These things are, it's a very beautiful idea\n\n1:56:05.340 --> 1:56:08.820\n when we start to treat space and time\n\n1:56:10.100 --> 1:56:13.740\n as similar frameworks.\n\n1:56:13.740 --> 1:56:14.580\n Yes, right.\n\n1:56:14.580 --> 1:56:15.420\n Physical phenomena.\n\n1:56:15.420 --> 1:56:17.500\n Right, that's what motivated it.\n\n1:56:17.500 --> 1:56:19.220\n First of all, what are crystals?\n\n1:56:19.220 --> 1:56:20.060\n Yeah.\n\n1:56:20.060 --> 1:56:20.900\n And what are time crystals?\n\n1:56:20.900 --> 1:56:24.540\n Okay, so crystals are orderly arrangements\n\n1:56:24.540 --> 1:56:27.340\n of atoms in space.\n\n1:56:27.340 --> 1:56:30.740\n And many materials,\n\n1:56:30.740 --> 1:56:35.740\n if you cool them down gently, will form crystals.\n\n1:56:38.580 --> 1:56:43.580\n And so we say that that's a state of matter\n\n1:56:43.900 --> 1:56:45.940\n that forms spontaneously.\n\n1:56:45.940 --> 1:56:50.220\n And an important feature of that state of matter\n\n1:56:50.220 --> 1:56:53.900\n is that the end result, the crystal,\n\n1:56:53.900 --> 1:56:58.900\n has less symmetry than the equations\n\n1:57:01.460 --> 1:57:03.100\n that give rise to the crystal.\n\n1:57:03.100 --> 1:57:07.500\n So the equations, the basic equations of physics\n\n1:57:09.260 --> 1:57:12.740\n are the same if you move a little bit.\n\n1:57:12.740 --> 1:57:15.620\n So you can move, they're homogeneous,\n\n1:57:15.620 --> 1:57:16.820\n but crystals aren't.\n\n1:57:16.820 --> 1:57:18.540\n The atoms are in particular place,\n\n1:57:18.540 --> 1:57:20.260\n so they have less symmetry.\n\n1:57:20.260 --> 1:57:25.260\n And time crystals are the same thing in time, basically.\n\n1:57:27.060 --> 1:57:30.220\n But of course, so it's not positions of atoms,\n\n1:57:30.220 --> 1:57:35.220\n but it's orderly behavior that certain states of matter\n\n1:57:38.220 --> 1:57:41.020\n will arrange themselves into spontaneously\n\n1:57:41.020 --> 1:57:44.780\n if you treat them gently\n\n1:57:44.780 --> 1:57:46.780\n and let them do what they want to do.\n\n1:57:46.780 --> 1:57:50.040\n But repeat in that same way indefinitely.\n\n1:57:50.040 --> 1:57:51.460\n That's the crystalline form.\n\n1:57:51.460 --> 1:57:54.940\n You can also have time liquids,\n\n1:57:54.940 --> 1:57:57.420\n or you can have all kinds of other states of matter.\n\n1:57:57.420 --> 1:57:58.960\n You can also have space time crystals\n\n1:57:58.960 --> 1:58:03.740\n where the pattern only repeats if with each step of time,\n\n1:58:03.740 --> 1:58:07.300\n you also move at a certain direction in space.\n\n1:58:07.300 --> 1:58:12.300\n So yeah, basically it's states of matter\n\n1:58:12.680 --> 1:58:17.680\n that displace structure in time spontaneously.\n\n1:58:17.680 --> 1:58:21.120\n So here's the difference.\n\n1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:22.800\n When it happens in time,\n\n1:58:24.900 --> 1:58:27.800\n it sure looks a lot like it's motion,\n\n1:58:27.800 --> 1:58:29.480\n and if it repeats indefinitely,\n\n1:58:29.480 --> 1:58:32.040\n it sure looks a lot like perpetual motion.\n\n1:58:32.040 --> 1:58:32.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:58:32.880 --> 1:58:35.080\n Like looks like free lunch.\n\n1:58:35.080 --> 1:58:39.280\n And I was told that there's no such thing as free lunch.\n\n1:58:39.280 --> 1:58:42.480\n Does this violate laws of thermodynamics?\n\n1:58:42.480 --> 1:58:45.640\n No, but it requires a critical examination\n\n1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:47.920\n of the laws of thermodynamics.\n\n1:58:47.920 --> 1:58:49.840\n I mean, let me say on background\n\n1:58:49.840 --> 1:58:51.560\n that the laws of thermodynamics\n\n1:58:51.560 --> 1:58:55.420\n are not fundamental laws of physics.\n\n1:58:55.420 --> 1:58:56.760\n There are things we prove\n\n1:58:58.920 --> 1:59:01.160\n under certain circumstances emerge\n\n1:59:01.160 --> 1:59:03.400\n from the fundamental laws of physics.\n\n1:59:03.400 --> 1:59:06.680\n They're not, we don't posit them separately.\n\n1:59:06.680 --> 1:59:08.300\n They're meant to be deduced,\n\n1:59:08.300 --> 1:59:10.600\n and they can be deduced under limited circumstances,\n\n1:59:10.600 --> 1:59:12.820\n but not necessarily universally.\n\n1:59:12.820 --> 1:59:15.560\n And we're finding some of the subtleties\n\n1:59:15.560 --> 1:59:18.360\n and sort of accept edge cases\n\n1:59:18.360 --> 1:59:21.060\n where they don't apply in a straightforward way.\n\n1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:23.560\n And this is one.\n\n1:59:25.200 --> 1:59:27.680\n So time crystals do obey,\n\n1:59:27.680 --> 1:59:30.400\n do have this structure in time,\n\n1:59:30.400 --> 1:59:31.980\n but it's not a free lunch\n\n1:59:31.980 --> 1:59:35.740\n because although in a sense, things are moving,\n\n1:59:36.680 --> 1:59:39.100\n they're already doing what they want to do.\n\n1:59:39.100 --> 1:59:40.400\n They're in the,\n\n1:59:40.400 --> 1:59:44.080\n so if you want to extract energy from it,\n\n1:59:44.080 --> 1:59:44.920\n you're gonna be foiled\n\n1:59:44.920 --> 1:59:47.880\n because there's no spare energy there.\n\n1:59:50.360 --> 1:59:53.900\n So you can add energy to it and kind of disturb it,\n\n1:59:53.900 --> 1:59:58.380\n but you can't extract energy from this motion\n\n1:59:58.380 --> 2:00:00.400\n because it's gonna, it wants to do,\n\n2:00:00.400 --> 2:00:03.420\n that's the lowest energy configuration that there is,\n\n2:00:03.420 --> 2:00:06.120\n so you can't get further energy out of it.\n\n2:00:06.120 --> 2:00:08.680\n So in theory, I guess perpetual motion,\n\n2:00:10.200 --> 2:00:13.080\n you would be able to extract energy from it\n\n2:00:13.080 --> 2:00:15.080\n if such a thing was to be created,\n\n2:00:15.080 --> 2:00:17.080\n you can then milk it for energy.\n\n2:00:17.080 --> 2:00:20.320\n Well, what's usually meant\n\n2:00:20.320 --> 2:00:23.040\n in the literature of perpetual motion\n\n2:00:23.040 --> 2:00:27.560\n is a kind of macroscopic motion\n\n2:00:27.560 --> 2:00:29.400\n that you could extract energy from\n\n2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:33.540\n and somehow it would crank back up.\n\n2:00:33.540 --> 2:00:35.160\n That's not the case here.\n\n2:00:35.160 --> 2:00:36.760\n If you want to extract energy,\n\n2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:42.160\n this motion is not something you can extract energy from.\n\n2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:45.400\n If you intervene in the behavior,\n\n2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:48.960\n you can change it, but only by injecting energy,\n\n2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:51.120\n not by taking away energy.\n\n2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:54.160\n You mentioned that a theory of everything\n\n2:00:54.160 --> 2:00:56.480\n may be quite difficult to come by.\n\n2:00:56.480 --> 2:00:58.520\n A theory of everything broadly defined\n\n2:00:58.520 --> 2:01:00.760\n meaning like truly a theory of everything,\n\n2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:03.120\n but let's look at a more narrow theory of everything,\n\n2:01:03.120 --> 2:01:07.160\n which is the way it's used often in physics\n\n2:01:07.160 --> 2:01:12.160\n is a theory that unifies our current laws of physics,\n\n2:01:16.400 --> 2:01:19.480\n general relativity, quantum field theory.\n\n2:01:19.480 --> 2:01:22.680\n Do you have thoughts on this dream\n\n2:01:22.680 --> 2:01:25.380\n of a theory of everything in physics?\n\n2:01:25.380 --> 2:01:26.640\n How close are we?\n\n2:01:26.640 --> 2:01:29.480\n Is there any promising ideas out there in your view?\n\n2:01:29.480 --> 2:01:31.120\n Well, it would be nice to have.\n\n2:01:32.380 --> 2:01:34.080\n It would be aesthetically pleasing.\n\n2:01:35.480 --> 2:01:36.780\n Will it be useful?\n\n2:01:36.780 --> 2:01:38.520\n No, probably not.\n\n2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:43.220\n Well, I shouldn't, it's dangerous to say that,\n\n2:01:43.220 --> 2:01:45.040\n but probably not.\n\n2:01:45.040 --> 2:01:50.040\n I think we, certainly not in the foreseeable future.\n\n2:01:52.160 --> 2:01:54.240\n Maybe to understand black holes.\n\n2:01:54.240 --> 2:01:57.520\n Yeah, but that's, yes, maybe to understand black holes,\n\n2:01:57.520 --> 2:02:00.400\n but that's not useful.\n\n2:02:00.400 --> 2:02:02.700\n That's my book.\n\n2:02:02.700 --> 2:02:04.960\n And well, not only, I mean,\n\n2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:08.320\n to understand it's worse,\n\n2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:09.520\n it's not useful in the sense\n\n2:02:09.520 --> 2:02:12.880\n that we're not gonna be basing any technology anytime soon\n\n2:02:12.880 --> 2:02:16.020\n on black holes, but it's more severe than that,\n\n2:02:16.020 --> 2:02:19.840\n I would say it's that the kinds of questions\n\n2:02:19.840 --> 2:02:24.200\n about black holes that we can't answer\n\n2:02:24.200 --> 2:02:26.480\n within the framework of existing theory\n\n2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:33.480\n are ones that are not going to be susceptible\n\n2:02:33.480 --> 2:02:37.620\n to astronomical observation in the foreseeable future.\n\n2:02:37.620 --> 2:02:41.480\n They're questions about very, very small black holes\n\n2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:44.960\n when quantum effects come into play\n\n2:02:46.720 --> 2:02:48.000\n so that black holes are,\n\n2:02:50.280 --> 2:02:54.900\n not black holes, they're emitting this discovery\n\n2:02:54.900 --> 2:02:57.100\n of Hawking called Hawking radiation,\n\n2:02:57.100 --> 2:03:01.040\n which for astronomical black holes is a tiny, tiny effect\n\n2:03:01.040 --> 2:03:03.600\n that no one has ever observed, it's a prediction\n\n2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:04.440\n that's never been checked.\n\n2:03:04.440 --> 2:03:06.720\n So like supermassive black holes, that doesn't apply?\n\n2:03:06.720 --> 2:03:11.240\n No, no, the predicted rate of radiation\n\n2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:13.600\n from those black holes is so tiny\n\n2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:15.480\n that it's absolutely unobservable\n\n2:03:15.480 --> 2:03:17.920\n and is overwhelmed by all kinds of other effects.\n\n2:03:21.480 --> 2:03:24.420\n So it's not practical in the sense of technology,\n\n2:03:24.420 --> 2:03:26.400\n it's not even practical in the sense\n\n2:03:26.400 --> 2:03:31.400\n of application to astronomy, our existing theory\n\n2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:37.800\n of general relativity and quantum theory\n\n2:03:37.800 --> 2:03:41.680\n and our theory of the different fundamental forces\n\n2:03:41.680 --> 2:03:46.680\n is perfectly adequate to all problems of technology,\n\n2:03:46.680 --> 2:03:51.680\n of technology, for sure, and almost all problems\n\n2:03:58.080 --> 2:04:03.080\n of astrophysics and cosmology that appear\n\n2:04:03.080 --> 2:04:06.560\n except with the notable exception\n\n2:04:06.560 --> 2:04:09.480\n of the extremely early universe, if you want to ask,\n\n2:04:09.480 --> 2:04:11.120\n what happened before the Big Bang\n\n2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:13.020\n or what happened right at the Big Bang,\n\n2:04:13.020 --> 2:04:17.300\n which would be a great thing to understand, of course.\n\n2:04:17.300 --> 2:04:19.140\n Yes. We don't, but.\n\n2:04:19.140 --> 2:04:21.100\n But what about the engineering question?\n\n2:04:21.100 --> 2:04:23.900\n So if we look at space travel,\n\n2:04:23.900 --> 2:04:28.420\n so I think you've spoken with him, Eric Weinstein.\n\n2:04:28.420 --> 2:04:31.900\n Oh, yeah. Really, you know,\n\n2:04:31.900 --> 2:04:36.020\n he says things like we want to get off this planet.\n\n2:04:36.020 --> 2:04:39.140\n His intuition is almost motivated\n\n2:04:39.140 --> 2:04:42.300\n for the engineering project of space exploration\n\n2:04:42.300 --> 2:04:44.700\n in order for us to crack this problem\n\n2:04:44.700 --> 2:04:47.460\n of becoming a multi planetary species,\n\n2:04:47.460 --> 2:04:49.320\n we have to solve the physics problem.\n\n2:04:49.320 --> 2:04:51.460\n His intuition is like, if we figure out this,\n\n2:04:51.460 --> 2:04:55.020\n what he calls the source code, which is like,\n\n2:04:55.980 --> 2:05:00.660\n like a theory of everything might give us clues\n\n2:05:00.660 --> 2:05:04.260\n on how to start hacking the fabric of reality,\n\n2:05:04.260 --> 2:05:06.460\n like getting shortcuts, right?\n\n2:05:06.460 --> 2:05:08.820\n It might. I can't say that, you know,\n\n2:05:08.820 --> 2:05:10.100\n I can't say that it won't,\n\n2:05:10.100 --> 2:05:15.100\n but I can say that in the 1970s and early 1980s,\n\n2:05:16.380 --> 2:05:21.380\n we achieved huge steps in understanding matter.\n\n2:05:23.860 --> 2:05:28.780\n QCD, much better understanding of the weak interaction,\n\n2:05:28.780 --> 2:05:32.460\n much better understanding of quantum mechanics in general.\n\n2:05:32.460 --> 2:05:36.460\n And it's had minimal impact on technology.\n\n2:05:36.460 --> 2:05:38.180\n On rocket design, on propulsion.\n\n2:05:38.180 --> 2:05:42.620\n On rocket design, on anything, any technology whatsoever.\n\n2:05:42.620 --> 2:05:46.360\n And now we're talking about much more esoteric things.\n\n2:05:46.360 --> 2:05:48.800\n And since I don't know what they are,\n\n2:05:48.800 --> 2:05:51.180\n I can't say for sure that they won't affect technology,\n\n2:05:51.180 --> 2:05:52.700\n but I'm very, very skeptical\n\n2:05:52.700 --> 2:05:55.000\n that they would affect technology.\n\n2:05:57.780 --> 2:05:59.680\n Because, you know, to access them,\n\n2:05:59.680 --> 2:06:02.460\n you need very exotic circumstances\n\n2:06:02.460 --> 2:06:04.620\n to make new kinds of particles with high energy.\n\n2:06:04.620 --> 2:06:07.860\n You need accelerators that are very expensive\n\n2:06:07.860 --> 2:06:09.780\n and you don't produce many of them, and so forth.\n\n2:06:09.780 --> 2:06:13.060\n You know, it's just, it's a pipe dream, I think.\n\n2:06:13.060 --> 2:06:15.380\n Yeah, about space exploration.\n\n2:06:15.380 --> 2:06:18.140\n I'm not sure exactly what he has in mind,\n\n2:06:18.140 --> 2:06:23.140\n but to me, it's more a problem of,\n\n2:06:26.700 --> 2:06:29.380\n I don't know, something between biology and...\n\n2:06:29.380 --> 2:06:34.380\n And information processing.\n\n2:06:34.380 --> 2:06:36.980\n Processing, what you mean, how should I...\n\n2:06:37.980 --> 2:06:42.140\n I think human bodies are not well adapted to space.\n\n2:06:43.700 --> 2:06:46.380\n Even Mars, which is the closest thing\n\n2:06:46.380 --> 2:06:49.140\n to a kind of human environment\n\n2:06:49.140 --> 2:06:51.140\n that we're gonna find anywhere close by.\n\n2:06:52.340 --> 2:06:55.880\n Very, very difficult to maintain humans on Mars.\n\n2:06:57.300 --> 2:07:02.300\n And it's gonna be very expensive and very unstable.\n\n2:07:02.300 --> 2:07:07.300\n But I think, however, if we take a broader view\n\n2:07:09.520 --> 2:07:14.520\n of what it means to bring human civilization\n\n2:07:17.460 --> 2:07:20.660\n outside of the Earth, if we're satisfied\n\n2:07:20.660 --> 2:07:25.380\n with sending mines out there that we can converse with\n\n2:07:25.380 --> 2:07:29.180\n and actuators that we can manipulate\n\n2:07:29.180 --> 2:07:33.780\n and sensors that we can get feedback from,\n\n2:07:33.780 --> 2:07:37.180\n I think that's where it's at.\n\n2:07:37.180 --> 2:07:41.580\n And I think that's so much more realistic.\n\n2:07:41.580 --> 2:07:45.820\n And I think that's the long term future\n\n2:07:45.820 --> 2:07:48.180\n of space exploration.\n\n2:07:48.180 --> 2:07:50.660\n It's not hauling human bodies all over the place.\n\n2:07:50.660 --> 2:07:52.840\n That's just silly.\n\n2:07:54.100 --> 2:07:56.780\n It's possible that human bodies...\n\n2:07:56.780 --> 2:07:59.100\n So like you said, it's a biology problem.\n\n2:07:59.100 --> 2:08:03.540\n What's possible is that we extend human life span\n\n2:08:03.540 --> 2:08:07.540\n in some way, we have to look at a bigger picture.\n\n2:08:07.540 --> 2:08:09.420\n It could be just like you're saying,\n\n2:08:09.420 --> 2:08:12.420\n by sending robots with actuators\n\n2:08:12.420 --> 2:08:16.540\n and kind of extending our limbs.\n\n2:08:16.540 --> 2:08:19.180\n But it could also be extending some aspect of our minds,\n\n2:08:19.180 --> 2:08:20.380\n some information, all those kinds of things.\n\n2:08:20.380 --> 2:08:23.820\n And it could be cyborgs, it could be, it could be...\n\n2:08:23.820 --> 2:08:26.620\n No, we're talking, not getting the fun.\n\n2:08:26.620 --> 2:08:31.620\n It could be, you know, it could be human brains\n\n2:08:32.140 --> 2:08:34.340\n or cells that realize something\n\n2:08:34.340 --> 2:08:36.860\n like human brain architecture\n\n2:08:36.860 --> 2:08:41.860\n within artificial environments,\n\n2:08:42.580 --> 2:08:44.860\n you know, shells, if you like,\n\n2:08:44.860 --> 2:08:47.780\n that are more adapted to the conditions of space.\n\n2:08:47.780 --> 2:08:52.780\n And that, yeah, so that's entirely man machine hybrids,\n\n2:08:52.780 --> 2:08:57.780\n as well as sort of remote outposts\n\n2:08:57.940 --> 2:08:59.220\n that we can communicate with.\n\n2:08:59.220 --> 2:09:01.660\n I think those will happen.\n\n2:09:02.500 --> 2:09:05.300\n Yeah, to me, there's some sense in which,\n\n2:09:05.300 --> 2:09:07.340\n as opposed to understanding the physics\n\n2:09:07.340 --> 2:09:12.340\n of the fundamental fabric of the universe,\n\n2:09:15.100 --> 2:09:17.380\n I think getting to the physics of life,\n\n2:09:17.380 --> 2:09:18.740\n the physics of intelligence,\n\n2:09:18.740 --> 2:09:20.860\n the physics of consciousness will,\n\n2:09:20.860 --> 2:09:25.860\n the physics of information that brings,\n\n2:09:27.900 --> 2:09:29.380\n from which life emerges,\n\n2:09:29.380 --> 2:09:32.140\n that will allow us to do space exploration.\n\n2:09:32.140 --> 2:09:34.700\n Yeah, well, I think physics in the larger sense\n\n2:09:34.700 --> 2:09:36.860\n has a lot to contribute here.\n\n2:09:36.860 --> 2:09:39.980\n Not the physics of finding fundamental new laws\n\n2:09:39.980 --> 2:09:44.820\n in the sense of another quark or axions even.\n\n2:09:44.820 --> 2:09:49.820\n But physics in the sense of,\n\n2:09:51.460 --> 2:09:53.500\n physics has a lot of experience\n\n2:09:53.500 --> 2:09:56.660\n in analyzing complex situations\n\n2:09:56.660 --> 2:09:58.260\n and analyzing new states of matter\n\n2:09:58.260 --> 2:10:00.180\n and devising new kinds of instruments\n\n2:10:00.180 --> 2:10:01.580\n that do clever things.\n\n2:10:01.580 --> 2:10:05.940\n Physics in that sense has enormous amounts\n\n2:10:05.940 --> 2:10:09.980\n to contribute to this kind of endeavor.\n\n2:10:09.980 --> 2:10:13.180\n But I don't think that looking\n\n2:10:13.180 --> 2:10:16.620\n for a so called theory of everything\n\n2:10:16.620 --> 2:10:19.020\n has much to do with it at all.\n\n2:10:19.020 --> 2:10:24.020\n What advice would you give to a young person today\n\n2:10:24.820 --> 2:10:26.380\n with a bit of fire in their eyes,\n\n2:10:26.380 --> 2:10:28.100\n high school student, college student,\n\n2:10:28.100 --> 2:10:30.460\n thinking about what to do with their life,\n\n2:10:30.460 --> 2:10:35.060\n maybe advice about career or bigger advice\n\n2:10:35.060 --> 2:10:36.220\n about life in general?\n\n2:10:37.460 --> 2:10:38.900\n Well, first read fundamentals\n\n2:10:38.900 --> 2:10:43.900\n because there I've tried to give some coherent deep advice.\n\n2:10:45.780 --> 2:10:50.140\n That's fundamentals, 10 keys to reality by Frank Kulczyk.\n\n2:10:50.140 --> 2:10:50.980\n So that's a good place to start.\n\n2:10:50.980 --> 2:10:52.260\n Available everywhere.\n\n2:10:52.260 --> 2:10:55.180\n If you wanna learn what I can tell you.\n\n2:10:56.820 --> 2:10:57.740\n Is there an audio book?\n\n2:10:57.740 --> 2:10:58.580\n I read that ebook.\n\n2:10:58.580 --> 2:10:59.420\n Yes, there is an audio book.\n\n2:10:59.420 --> 2:11:00.860\n There's an audio book, that's awesome.\n\n2:11:00.860 --> 2:11:05.220\n I think it's, I can give three pieces of wise advice\n\n2:11:05.220 --> 2:11:08.340\n that I think are generally applicable.\n\n2:11:08.340 --> 2:11:11.780\n One is to cast a wide net,\n\n2:11:13.580 --> 2:11:18.580\n to really look around and see what looks promising,\n\n2:11:19.460 --> 2:11:22.460\n what catches your imagination and promising.\n\n2:11:25.860 --> 2:11:28.380\n Yeah, and those, you have to balance those two things.\n\n2:11:28.380 --> 2:11:30.060\n You could have things that catch your imagination,\n\n2:11:30.060 --> 2:11:32.420\n but don't look promising in the sense\n\n2:11:32.420 --> 2:11:34.580\n that the questions aren't ripe or,\n\n2:11:34.580 --> 2:11:37.900\n and things that you,\n\n2:11:37.900 --> 2:11:42.340\n and part of what makes things attractive is that,\n\n2:11:42.340 --> 2:11:43.940\n whether you thought you liked them or not,\n\n2:11:43.940 --> 2:11:45.980\n is if you can see that there's ferment\n\n2:11:45.980 --> 2:11:47.660\n and new ideas coming up that become,\n\n2:11:47.660 --> 2:11:49.420\n that's attractive in itself.\n\n2:11:49.420 --> 2:11:52.340\n So when I started out, I thought I was,\n\n2:11:52.340 --> 2:11:53.580\n and when I was an undergraduate,\n\n2:11:53.580 --> 2:11:55.420\n I intended to study philosophy\n\n2:11:55.420 --> 2:11:57.660\n or questions of how mind emerges from matter.\n\n2:11:57.660 --> 2:12:00.300\n But I thought that that wasn't really right.\n\n2:12:00.300 --> 2:12:01.260\n Timing isn't right yet.\n\n2:12:01.260 --> 2:12:03.020\n The right, the timing wasn't right\n\n2:12:03.020 --> 2:12:05.220\n for the kind of mathematical thinking\n\n2:12:05.220 --> 2:12:10.220\n and conceptualization that I really enjoy and am good at.\n\n2:12:12.340 --> 2:12:17.260\n But, so that's one thing, cast a wide net, look around.\n\n2:12:18.780 --> 2:12:23.780\n And that's a pretty easy thing to do today\n\n2:12:25.260 --> 2:12:27.060\n because of the internet.\n\n2:12:27.060 --> 2:12:30.060\n You can look at all kinds of things.\n\n2:12:30.060 --> 2:12:30.940\n You have to be careful though\n\n2:12:30.940 --> 2:12:33.460\n because there's a lot of crap also.\n\n2:12:33.460 --> 2:12:36.620\n But you can sort of tell the difference\n\n2:12:36.620 --> 2:12:38.780\n if you do a little digging.\n\n2:12:42.460 --> 2:12:44.940\n So don't settle on just,\n\n2:12:44.940 --> 2:12:46.780\n what your thesis advisor tells you to do\n\n2:12:46.780 --> 2:12:49.100\n or what your teacher tells you to do.\n\n2:12:49.100 --> 2:12:54.100\n Look for yourself and get a sense of what seems promising,\n\n2:12:54.100 --> 2:12:59.100\n not what seemed promising 10 years ago or, so that's one.\n\n2:13:03.620 --> 2:13:08.620\n Another thing is to, is kind of complimentary to that.\n\n2:13:09.980 --> 2:13:11.740\n Well, they're all complimentary.\n\n2:13:12.860 --> 2:13:17.860\n Complimentary to that is to read history\n\n2:13:18.260 --> 2:13:19.860\n and read the masters,\n\n2:13:19.860 --> 2:13:22.300\n the history of ideas and masters of ideas.\n\n2:13:22.300 --> 2:13:27.300\n I'd benefited enormously from, as early in my career,\n\n2:13:28.420 --> 2:13:33.420\n from reading in physics, Einstein in the original\n\n2:13:34.420 --> 2:13:39.420\n and Feynman's lectures as they were coming out and Darwin.\n\n2:13:39.620 --> 2:13:43.540\n You know, these, you can learn what it, and Galileo,\n\n2:13:43.540 --> 2:13:46.700\n you can learn what it is to wrestle with difficult ideas\n\n2:13:46.700 --> 2:13:48.180\n and how great minds did that.\n\n2:13:48.180 --> 2:13:51.220\n You can learn a lot about style,\n\n2:13:51.220 --> 2:13:56.220\n how to write your ideas up and express them in clear ways.\n\n2:13:57.740 --> 2:14:00.180\n And also just a couple of that with,\n\n2:14:00.180 --> 2:14:02.300\n I also enjoy reading biographies.\n\n2:14:02.300 --> 2:14:04.660\n And biographies, yes, similarly, right, yeah.\n\n2:14:04.660 --> 2:14:08.100\n So it gives you the context of the human being\n\n2:14:08.100 --> 2:14:08.940\n that created those ideas.\n\n2:14:08.940 --> 2:14:11.860\n Right, and brings it down to earth in the sense that,\n\n2:14:11.860 --> 2:14:14.100\n you know, it was really human beings who did this.\n\n2:14:14.100 --> 2:14:17.180\n It's not, and they made mistakes.\n\n2:14:17.180 --> 2:14:22.180\n And yeah, I also got inspiration from Bertrand Russell\n\n2:14:22.980 --> 2:14:25.460\n who was a big hero and H.G. Wells and yeah.\n\n2:14:25.460 --> 2:14:30.460\n So read the masters, make contact with great minds.\n\n2:14:31.420 --> 2:14:33.900\n And when you are sort of narrowing down on a subject,\n\n2:14:33.900 --> 2:14:35.460\n learn about the history of the subject\n\n2:14:35.460 --> 2:14:38.380\n because that really puts in context\n\n2:14:38.380 --> 2:14:43.380\n what you're trying to do and also gives a sense of community\n\n2:14:43.980 --> 2:14:46.020\n and grandeur to the whole enterprise.\n\n2:14:46.020 --> 2:14:48.900\n And then the third piece of advice\n\n2:14:48.900 --> 2:14:51.860\n is complimentary to both those,\n\n2:14:51.860 --> 2:14:56.860\n which is sort of to get the basics under control\n\n2:14:58.860 --> 2:15:00.420\n as soon as possible.\n\n2:15:00.420 --> 2:15:04.220\n So if you wanna do theoretical work in science,\n\n2:15:04.220 --> 2:15:08.420\n you know, you have to learn calculus,\n\n2:15:08.420 --> 2:15:11.600\n multivariable calculus, complex variables, group theory.\n\n2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:15.300\n Nowadays, you have to be highly computer literate\n\n2:15:15.300 --> 2:15:16.540\n if you want to do experimental work.\n\n2:15:16.540 --> 2:15:17.980\n You also have to be computer literate\n\n2:15:17.980 --> 2:15:19.660\n and you have to learn about electronics\n\n2:15:19.660 --> 2:15:22.260\n and optics and instruments.\n\n2:15:22.260 --> 2:15:26.860\n So get that under control as soon as possible\n\n2:15:26.860 --> 2:15:31.860\n because it's like learning a language to produce great works\n\n2:15:32.640 --> 2:15:35.580\n and express yourself fluently and with confidence.\n\n2:15:37.980 --> 2:15:39.460\n It should be your native language.\n\n2:15:39.460 --> 2:15:41.420\n These things should be like your native language.\n\n2:15:41.420 --> 2:15:44.660\n So you're not wondering what is the derivative?\n\n2:15:44.660 --> 2:15:49.660\n This is just part of your, it's in your bones,\n\n2:15:50.300 --> 2:15:53.380\n so to speak, and the sooner that you can do that,\n\n2:15:53.380 --> 2:15:55.060\n then the better.\n\n2:15:55.060 --> 2:15:57.980\n So all those things can be done in parallel and should be.\n\n2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:04.520\n You've accomplished some incredible things in your life,\n\n2:16:04.520 --> 2:16:09.520\n but the sad thing about this thing we have is it ends.\n\n2:16:09.520 --> 2:16:14.520\n Do you think about your mortality?\n\n2:16:15.240 --> 2:16:16.440\n Are you afraid of death?\n\n2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:20.440\n Well, afraid is the wrong word.\n\n2:16:20.440 --> 2:16:23.960\n I mean, I wish it weren't going to happen\n\n2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:25.760\n and I'd like to, but.\n\n2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:28.040\n Do you think about it?\n\n2:16:28.040 --> 2:16:30.460\n I, you know, occasionally I think about,\n\n2:16:30.460 --> 2:16:32.400\n well, I think about it very operationally\n\n2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:35.480\n in the sense that there's always a trade off\n\n2:16:35.480 --> 2:16:39.480\n between exploration and exploitation.\n\n2:16:39.480 --> 2:16:42.580\n This is a classic subject in computer science,\n\n2:16:42.580 --> 2:16:46.280\n actually in machine learning that when you're\n\n2:16:46.280 --> 2:16:50.600\n in an unusual circumstance, you want to explore\n\n2:16:50.600 --> 2:16:54.700\n to see what the landscape is and what, and gather data.\n\n2:16:54.700 --> 2:16:57.680\n But then at some point you want to use that,\n\n2:16:57.680 --> 2:17:00.000\n make, decide, make choices and say,\n\n2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:02.040\n this is what I'm going to do and exploit the knowledge\n\n2:17:02.040 --> 2:17:03.360\n you've accumulated.\n\n2:17:03.360 --> 2:17:08.360\n And the longer the period of exploitation you anticipate,\n\n2:17:10.480 --> 2:17:14.600\n the more exploration you should do in new directions.\n\n2:17:14.600 --> 2:17:18.760\n And so for me, I've had to sort of adjust the balance\n\n2:17:18.760 --> 2:17:21.760\n of exploration and exploitation and.\n\n2:17:25.880 --> 2:17:28.180\n That's it, you've explored quite a lot.\n\n2:17:28.180 --> 2:17:31.960\n Yeah, well, I haven't shut off the exploitation at all.\n\n2:17:31.960 --> 2:17:34.000\n I'm still hoping for. The exploration.\n\n2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:35.200\n The exploration, right.\n\n2:17:35.200 --> 2:17:38.280\n I'm still hoping for 10 or 15 years\n\n2:17:38.280 --> 2:17:39.560\n of top flight performance.\n\n2:17:39.560 --> 2:17:44.560\n But the, several years ago now when I was 50 years old,\n\n2:17:47.480 --> 2:17:49.540\n I was at the Institute for Advanced Study\n\n2:17:49.540 --> 2:17:52.500\n and my office was right under Freeman Dyson's office\n\n2:17:52.500 --> 2:17:53.920\n and we were kind of friendly.\n\n2:17:53.920 --> 2:17:58.760\n And, you know, he found out it was my 50th birthday\n\n2:17:58.760 --> 2:18:00.960\n and said, congratulations.\n\n2:18:00.960 --> 2:18:05.040\n And you should feel liberated because no one expects much\n\n2:18:05.040 --> 2:18:07.480\n of a 50 year old theoretical physicist.\n\n2:18:07.480 --> 2:18:10.120\n And he, and he obviously had felt liberated\n\n2:18:10.120 --> 2:18:13.160\n by reaching a certain age.\n\n2:18:13.160 --> 2:18:15.680\n And yeah, there is something to that.\n\n2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:19.280\n I feel, you know, I feel I don't have to catch,\n\n2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:21.640\n I don't have to keep in touch\n\n2:18:21.640 --> 2:18:25.000\n with the latest hypertechnical developments\n\n2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:27.600\n in particle physics or string theory or something.\n\n2:18:27.600 --> 2:18:31.560\n I, because I'm not gonna, I'm really not gonna\n\n2:18:31.560 --> 2:18:33.280\n be exploiting that.\n\n2:18:33.280 --> 2:18:37.640\n But I, but where I am exploring in these directions\n\n2:18:37.640 --> 2:18:40.120\n of machine learning and things like that.\n\n2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:43.040\n And, but then, but I'm also concentrating\n\n2:18:43.040 --> 2:18:46.480\n within physics on exploiting directions\n\n2:18:46.480 --> 2:18:48.000\n that I've already established\n\n2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:50.040\n and the laws that we already have\n\n2:18:50.040 --> 2:18:52.260\n and doing things like,\n\n2:18:52.260 --> 2:18:57.260\n I'm very actively involved in trying to design,\n\n2:18:58.300 --> 2:19:02.620\n helping people, experimentalists and engineers even\n\n2:19:02.620 --> 2:19:07.620\n to design antennas that are capable of detecting axions.\n\n2:19:08.300 --> 2:19:10.980\n So there, and that's, there we're deep\n\n2:19:10.980 --> 2:19:13.140\n in the exploitation stage.\n\n2:19:13.140 --> 2:19:14.940\n It's not a matter of finding the new laws,\n\n2:19:14.940 --> 2:19:17.860\n but of really, you know, using the laws we have\n\n2:19:17.860 --> 2:19:20.860\n to kind of finish the story off.\n\n2:19:20.860 --> 2:19:24.660\n So it's complicated, but I'm, you know,\n\n2:19:25.500 --> 2:19:27.900\n I'm very happy with my life right now\n\n2:19:27.900 --> 2:19:31.700\n and I'm enjoying it and I don't wanna cloud that\n\n2:19:31.700 --> 2:19:36.700\n by thinking too much that it's gonna come to an end.\n\n2:19:39.780 --> 2:19:42.060\n You know, it's a gift I didn't earn.\n\n2:19:42.060 --> 2:19:45.100\n Is there a good thing to say about\n\n2:19:45.100 --> 2:19:50.100\n why this gift that you've gotten\n\n2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:53.120\n and didn't deserve is so damn enjoyable?\n\n2:19:53.120 --> 2:19:57.240\n So like, what's the meaning of this thing, of life?\n\n2:19:57.240 --> 2:20:01.600\n To me, interacting with people I love, my family,\n\n2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:04.920\n and I have a very wide circle of friends now\n\n2:20:04.920 --> 2:20:08.960\n and I'm trying to produce some institutions\n\n2:20:08.960 --> 2:20:12.000\n that will survive me as well as my work\n\n2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:17.000\n and it's just, it's, how should I say?\n\n2:20:18.760 --> 2:20:23.760\n It's a positive feedback loop when you do something\n\n2:20:24.720 --> 2:20:28.360\n and people appreciate it and then you wanna do more\n\n2:20:28.360 --> 2:20:32.220\n and you get rewarded and it's just, how should I say?\n\n2:20:32.220 --> 2:20:34.040\n This is another gift that I didn't earn\n\n2:20:34.040 --> 2:20:37.520\n and don't understand, but I have a dopamine system\n\n2:20:37.520 --> 2:20:42.280\n and yeah, I'm happy to use it.\n\n2:20:42.280 --> 2:20:47.280\n It seems to get energized by the creative process,\n\n2:20:47.360 --> 2:20:48.920\n by the process of exploration.\n\n2:20:48.920 --> 2:20:49.760\n Very much so.\n\n2:20:49.760 --> 2:20:54.240\n And all of that started from the little fluctuations\n\n2:20:56.160 --> 2:20:58.640\n shortly after the Big Bang.\n\n2:20:58.640 --> 2:21:01.640\n Frank, well, whatever those initial conditions\n\n2:21:01.640 --> 2:21:04.600\n and fluctuations did that created you, I'm glad they did.\n\n2:21:04.600 --> 2:21:07.640\n This is, thank you for all the work you've done,\n\n2:21:07.640 --> 2:21:09.280\n for the many people you've inspired,\n\n2:21:09.280 --> 2:21:12.740\n for the many, of the billion, most of your ideas\n\n2:21:12.740 --> 2:21:15.080\n were pretty useless of the several billions,\n\n2:21:16.480 --> 2:21:20.040\n as it is for all humans, but you had quite a few\n\n2:21:20.040 --> 2:21:23.140\n truly special ideas and thank you for bringing those\n\n2:21:23.140 --> 2:21:25.680\n to the world and thank you for wasting your valuable time\n\n2:21:25.680 --> 2:21:27.760\n with me today, it's truly an honor.\n\n2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:31.840\n It's been a joy and I hope people enjoy it\n\n2:21:31.840 --> 2:21:36.840\n and I think the kind of mind expansion that I've enjoyed\n\n2:21:37.120 --> 2:21:41.240\n by interacting with physical reality at this deep level,\n\n2:21:41.240 --> 2:21:45.540\n I think can be conveyed to and enjoyed by many, many people\n\n2:21:45.540 --> 2:21:48.040\n and that's one of my missions in life, to share it.\n\n2:21:48.040 --> 2:21:49.360\n Beautiful.\n\n2:21:49.360 --> 2:21:50.880\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:21:50.880 --> 2:21:54.040\n with Frank Wilczek and thank you to The Information,\n\n2:21:54.040 --> 2:21:58.500\n NatSuite, ExpressVPN, Blinkist and 8sleep.\n\n2:21:58.500 --> 2:22:01.720\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast\n\n2:22:01.720 --> 2:22:03.320\n and now let me leave you with some words\n\n2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:08.100\n from Albert Einstein, nothing happens until something moves.\n\n2:22:08.100 --> 2:22:31.100\n Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
