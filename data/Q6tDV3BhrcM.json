economic power.\n\n00:09.360 --> 00:14.000\n If you have economic power, no one messes with you.\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:15.840\n Or if they're gonna do it, they're gonna have to think twice\n\n00:15.840 --> 00:18.640\n and when they do, they're gonna have to pay consequences.\n\n00:20.640 --> 00:23.560\n The following is a conversation with Magat Wade,\n\n00:23.560 --> 00:25.920\n an entrepreneur who's passionate\n\n00:25.920 --> 00:28.120\n about creating positive change in Africa\n\n00:28.120 --> 00:31.000\n through economic empowerment.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:33.000\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:34.880\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:34.880 --> 00:36.120\n in the description.\n\n00:36.120 --> 00:39.680\n And now, dear friends, here's Magat Wade.\n\n00:40.520 --> 00:42.940\n You were born in Senegal.\n\n00:42.940 --> 00:45.480\n You have lived and traveled across the world.\n\n00:45.480 --> 00:48.360\n So let me ask you, what is the soul of Senegal?\n\n00:48.360 --> 00:51.840\n Like, its people, its culture, its history.\n\n00:51.840 --> 00:55.880\n Can you try to sneak up on telling us\n\n00:55.880 --> 00:58.160\n what is the spirit of its people?\n\n00:58.160 --> 01:00.720\n Taranga, Taranga.\n\n01:00.720 --> 01:02.840\n Taranga, it's a Wolof word.\n\n01:02.840 --> 01:05.680\n Wolof is the main indigenous language of Senegal\n\n01:05.680 --> 01:07.840\n and it means hospitality.\n\n01:07.840 --> 01:11.560\n That is what us, the people of Senegal, are known for.\n\n01:11.560 --> 01:14.160\n And it transpires in everything that we do,\n\n01:15.360 --> 01:16.960\n everything that we say.\n\n01:16.960 --> 01:19.880\n It's a place where, I guess with hospitality,\n\n01:19.880 --> 01:21.700\n goes this concept of warmth.\n\n01:21.700 --> 01:25.320\n So we are a very warm people.\n\n01:25.320 --> 01:26.440\n So in a nutshell, that's us.\n\n01:26.440 --> 01:28.600\n That's us, the place where you come\n\n01:28.600 --> 01:31.440\n and everybody will just embrace you,\n\n01:31.440 --> 01:32.920\n make you feel very comfortable,\n\n01:32.920 --> 01:35.320\n make you feel like you're the only person in the world\n\n01:35.320 --> 01:37.720\n and that we've been waiting for you our whole life, right?\n\n01:37.720 --> 01:39.360\n So that's my country.\n\n01:39.360 --> 01:43.160\n So that's for people in Senegal, people in Africa,\n\n01:43.160 --> 01:45.720\n or also people across the world,\n\n01:45.720 --> 01:47.680\n weird strangers from all walks of life.\n\n01:47.680 --> 01:49.360\n So hospitality towards everyone.\n\n01:49.360 --> 01:51.320\n For everyone, for everyone.\n\n01:51.320 --> 01:54.280\n Especially towards the foreigner\n\n01:54.280 --> 01:57.920\n because it's very ingrained in us,\n\n01:57.920 --> 02:00.900\n this understanding that especially the foreigner,\n\n02:00.900 --> 02:01.960\n the foreigner is called foreigner\n\n02:01.960 --> 02:03.780\n because the foreigner is coming from somewhere else.\n\n02:03.780 --> 02:07.080\n So if someone has taken the time and the energy,\n\n02:07.080 --> 02:11.200\n whether in a forced manner or because it's a choice\n\n02:11.200 --> 02:14.880\n to travel so far to come to a place that's not theirs,\n\n02:14.880 --> 02:17.600\n to start where that's where the foreigners again,\n\n02:17.600 --> 02:20.640\n then it is your duty to welcome them,\n\n02:20.640 --> 02:23.080\n to be uber welcoming to them.\n\n02:23.080 --> 02:24.960\n So there's not a fear of the foreigner.\n\n02:24.960 --> 02:26.680\n There's not a suspicion of the foreigner.\n\n02:26.680 --> 02:28.400\n No, no, no.\n\n02:28.400 --> 02:31.320\n And I think this goes with the other way around.\n\n02:31.320 --> 02:34.080\n Maybe it has to do with just,\n\n02:34.080 --> 02:36.080\n you know, when you feel good about yourself,\n\n02:36.080 --> 02:37.760\n when you're very grounded yourself,\n\n02:37.760 --> 02:39.880\n it's very easy to open yourself to others.\n\n02:39.880 --> 02:42.880\n And I'm wondering if that's not, you know,\n\n02:42.880 --> 02:45.580\n the other side of the equation in a way.\n\n02:45.580 --> 02:49.560\n So no, we don't have a fear towards a foreigner.\n\n02:49.560 --> 02:50.400\n That's just no.\n\n02:50.400 --> 02:53.880\n When you have a pride of your culture,\n\n02:53.880 --> 02:56.840\n pride of your own people, it's easier to sort of embrace.\n\n02:56.840 --> 02:59.120\n I mean, it's interesting how these kind of cultures emerge\n\n02:59.120 --> 03:02.720\n because, you know, the Slavic countries\n\n03:02.720 --> 03:05.460\n are sometimes colder.\n\n03:05.460 --> 03:07.840\n They're slower to trust others.\n\n03:07.840 --> 03:09.360\n We're now here in Austin, Texas.\n\n03:09.360 --> 03:11.160\n One of the reasons I fell in love with this place\n\n03:11.160 --> 03:13.860\n when I showed up is there's that same hospitality\n\n03:13.860 --> 03:17.240\n as compared to other cities I've lived in,\n\n03:17.240 --> 03:22.000\n sort of Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:26.560\n There's a hesitation to open up, to be fragile,\n\n03:26.560 --> 03:31.280\n to be caring before understanding\n\n03:31.280 --> 03:34.920\n what I can gain from you kind of calculation.\n\n03:34.920 --> 03:35.760\n It's really interesting.\n\n03:35.760 --> 03:39.200\n And I wonder how those kinds of dynamics emerge\n\n03:39.200 --> 03:41.820\n because they're certainly parts of the world.\n\n03:41.820 --> 03:43.240\n Like Austin is one of them\n\n03:43.240 --> 03:45.040\n where you just feel the kindness,\n\n03:45.040 --> 03:48.280\n just radiate without knowing kindness from strangers.\n\n03:49.640 --> 03:52.760\n You know, if I were to advance one thing,\n\n03:52.760 --> 03:54.920\n and I had the same experience\n\n03:56.360 --> 03:59.520\n after having lived in San Francisco first,\n\n03:59.520 --> 04:02.600\n then we went to New York, then we came to Austin.\n\n04:02.600 --> 04:04.300\n And when we came to Austin, I felt,\n\n04:04.300 --> 04:06.360\n it took me a while to put my finger on it,\n\n04:06.360 --> 04:10.480\n but what I found in Austin, people just hang.\n\n04:10.480 --> 04:11.940\n People, right?\n\n04:11.940 --> 04:13.000\n They're real.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:13.840\n They're real.\n\n04:13.840 --> 04:15.400\n And like what you were saying, I feel like\n\n04:15.400 --> 04:18.640\n in these other places, people are,\n\n04:18.640 --> 04:21.320\n it's a destination for people who want to come and perform.\n\n04:21.320 --> 04:24.440\n I think maybe the early San Francisco people,\n\n04:24.440 --> 04:25.740\n it was different for them.\n\n04:26.960 --> 04:30.520\n But later as prosperity starts to come in\n\n04:30.520 --> 04:34.040\n and success comes in, then you attract a different breed.\n\n04:34.040 --> 04:36.160\n At first, we're the people who made it,\n\n04:36.160 --> 04:38.920\n who made this place be what it is.\n\n04:38.920 --> 04:41.960\n And then it attracts all the bling followers\n\n04:41.960 --> 04:43.800\n and the bling attracted people.\n\n04:43.800 --> 04:45.120\n And when those people show up,\n\n04:45.120 --> 04:47.240\n it's time for all of us to get out.\n\n04:47.240 --> 04:49.200\n And that's one of my worries about Austin too.\n\n04:49.200 --> 04:51.400\n And I guess I'm one of, I count myself in it,\n\n04:51.400 --> 04:54.840\n but you know, because we're also new arrivees,\n\n04:54.840 --> 04:56.200\n always been furious now.\n\n04:56.200 --> 04:58.920\n But how are we gonna protect this place?\n\n04:58.920 --> 05:00.200\n Yeah.\n\n05:00.200 --> 05:02.820\n Yeah, these are, you know, the best possible version\n\n05:02.820 --> 05:04.300\n of the Austin history.\n\n05:04.300 --> 05:07.120\n This is the early days of Silicon Valley in Austin.\n\n05:07.120 --> 05:09.400\n And so you get a chance to build\n\n05:09.400 --> 05:12.940\n on top of this culture that's already been here\n\n05:12.940 --> 05:17.940\n of the weirdos, the artists, the sort of the characters,\n\n05:18.760 --> 05:21.880\n but also the general kindness and love\n\n05:21.880 --> 05:23.100\n that just permeates the whole place,\n\n05:23.100 --> 05:27.500\n build on top of that entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n05:27.500 --> 05:30.600\n So like the tech companies, new startups,\n\n05:30.600 --> 05:31.760\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n05:31.760 --> 05:35.440\n And then you get a chance to build totally new ideas,\n\n05:35.440 --> 05:38.160\n totally revolutionary ideas and make them a reality\n\n05:38.160 --> 05:40.280\n and dream big and build it here.\n\n05:40.280 --> 05:44.400\n I think Elon represents that with all the people\n\n05:44.400 --> 05:49.400\n that kind of try to do the cutting edge stuff\n\n05:50.120 --> 05:52.460\n they're doing at Tesla and SpaceX.\n\n05:52.460 --> 05:53.600\n But there's a bunch of other companies,\n\n05:53.600 --> 05:54.980\n they're just like coming up.\n\n05:54.980 --> 05:56.480\n I get to talk to a bunch of tech people\n\n05:56.480 --> 05:58.120\n and they're just incredible.\n\n05:58.120 --> 06:03.120\n Versus San Francisco, there's a cynicism a bit.\n\n06:03.400 --> 06:06.420\n And also some of the interaction with strangers,\n\n06:06.420 --> 06:08.200\n there's always a bit of a calculation,\n\n06:08.200 --> 06:11.160\n like how good is this going to be for my career?\n\n06:11.160 --> 06:12.080\n Or how can, yeah.\n\n06:12.080 --> 06:14.720\n How can hanging out with this person can advance me?\n\n06:14.720 --> 06:18.280\n You go to a party, they're seizing up.\n\n06:18.280 --> 06:19.680\n It's like, I'm not gonna talk to so and so\n\n06:19.680 --> 06:21.200\n because that's not gonna advance me.\n\n06:21.200 --> 06:22.520\n Who's gonna advance me next?\n\n06:22.520 --> 06:27.200\n And so this is what I would not wanna see here in Austin.\n\n06:27.200 --> 06:30.120\n And I think maybe there's one way to try to,\n\n06:30.120 --> 06:31.720\n I really would like to see Austin\n\n06:31.720 --> 06:33.720\n not go the way San Francisco did\n\n06:33.720 --> 06:34.560\n and other towns before.\n\n06:34.560 --> 06:36.840\n I like how you pronounce San Francisco with a French accent.\n\n06:36.840 --> 06:37.680\n San Francisco?\n\n06:37.680 --> 06:39.880\n Yeah, that's great.\n\n06:39.880 --> 06:42.080\n That's the one word you go with a French accent.\n\n06:42.080 --> 06:42.920\n You have to.\n\n06:42.920 --> 06:43.740\n It sounds beautiful.\n\n06:43.740 --> 06:44.580\n San Francisco.\n\n06:44.580 --> 06:45.760\n San Francisco.\n\n06:45.760 --> 06:50.320\n But you know, so now that you find that cute,\n\n06:50.320 --> 06:53.120\n you're gonna have to forgive me when I mess up my English\n\n06:53.120 --> 06:55.240\n because English is not my first language.\n\n06:55.240 --> 06:58.160\n So I always try to make sure people know that.\n\n06:58.160 --> 07:01.040\n But you know Lex, this is why I am very interested\n\n07:01.040 --> 07:03.760\n in what some folks here are working on.\n\n07:03.760 --> 07:05.440\n And I'm just gonna be very selfish here\n\n07:05.440 --> 07:07.880\n because I wanna help her with what she's doing.\n\n07:07.880 --> 07:11.680\n It's someone like, you know, Nicole Nodzak and her project,\n\n07:11.680 --> 07:14.500\n you know, with the housing project that they have right now,\n\n07:14.500 --> 07:16.720\n making sure that Austin remains a town\n\n07:16.720 --> 07:20.400\n that's affordable for people of all walks of lives.\n\n07:20.400 --> 07:24.060\n If we can accomplish making sure that all walks of lives,\n\n07:24.060 --> 07:28.260\n doesn't matter how little or big you're making money wise,\n\n07:28.260 --> 07:29.560\n that you can stay in this town\n\n07:29.560 --> 07:32.000\n so the diversity at that level can remain,\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.960\n then I think Austin stands a chance to really show the world\n\n07:34.960 --> 07:36.280\n how to do things differently.\n\n07:36.280 --> 07:38.600\n And what I love about, you know, her initiative\n\n07:38.600 --> 07:42.800\n is just how they're really trying, you know,\n\n07:42.800 --> 07:46.920\n to again work on keeping affordability down for most people.\n\n07:46.920 --> 07:48.840\n I think it's important to,\n\n07:48.840 --> 07:50.360\n because it seems like it matters to you,\n\n07:50.360 --> 07:51.840\n I know that it matters to me.\n\n07:51.840 --> 07:55.320\n I absolutely would not wanna see Austin go away\n\n07:55.320 --> 07:56.160\n that San Francisco did.\n\n07:56.160 --> 07:58.560\n And I think the key to that is making sure\n\n07:58.560 --> 07:59.480\n that true diversity,\n\n07:59.480 --> 08:02.240\n not like the fluff, fluff crap diversity we're hearing over there.\n\n08:02.240 --> 08:03.600\n And that's another thing by the way,\n\n08:03.600 --> 08:05.720\n because San Francisco likes to pride itself in,\n\n08:05.720 --> 08:09.200\n oh, you know, we are so into diversity,\n\n08:09.200 --> 08:13.040\n but I'm like, if diversity for you means gender,\n\n08:13.040 --> 08:16.560\n difference of gender, skin color, you know,\n\n08:16.560 --> 08:18.120\n maybe the different accents we have,\n\n08:18.120 --> 08:19.760\n and you think check, check, check, check, check,\n\n08:19.760 --> 08:21.720\n I'm like, it's not enough.\n\n08:21.720 --> 08:24.160\n Can we also add diversity of thoughts?\n\n08:24.160 --> 08:26.040\n And that's the other problem I have with that place,\n\n08:26.040 --> 08:26.880\n you know?\n\n08:26.880 --> 08:29.920\n And I know some folks who are scared of saying much\n\n08:29.920 --> 08:31.960\n around people, that's also another thing.\n\n08:31.960 --> 08:33.680\n So not only they're sizing you up,\n\n08:33.680 --> 08:36.720\n but everybody's also, there is this invisible,\n\n08:36.720 --> 08:40.520\n this invisible, how should I say this?\n\n08:40.520 --> 08:43.280\n There's this invisible agreement\n\n08:43.280 --> 08:46.000\n that they all seem to have to stay on script.\n\n08:47.080 --> 08:48.520\n Yeah, there's a feeling like you're following\n\n08:48.520 --> 08:51.640\n a certain kind of script that's very kind of shallow.\n\n08:51.640 --> 08:54.160\n And there is a bit of a categorization going on,\n\n08:54.160 --> 08:55.720\n which category do you belong to?\n\n08:55.720 --> 08:58.720\n And let's put this into a simple math equation,\n\n08:58.720 --> 09:03.600\n what comes out, as opposed to just the free, open embrace\n\n09:03.600 --> 09:06.840\n of people, the weirdos, the characters, the interesting,\n\n09:06.840 --> 09:09.800\n the full, deep sense of diversity.\n\n09:09.800 --> 09:14.800\n Not just ideas, but backgrounds, and rich and poor.\n\n09:16.200 --> 09:17.400\n Artists, engineers.\n\n09:17.400 --> 09:20.520\n High school dropouts, PhDs, all of this.\n\n09:20.520 --> 09:24.520\n Yes, yes, that's what makes for a rich society\n\n09:24.520 --> 09:25.760\n if it's gonna get ahead.\n\n09:25.760 --> 09:27.520\n I'm glad you mentioned Nicole's efforts,\n\n09:27.520 --> 09:29.400\n I know she really is passionate about.\n\n09:30.800 --> 09:32.720\n I don't know how complicated that work is,\n\n09:32.720 --> 09:37.720\n because there's probably a big force trying to increase\n\n09:40.080 --> 09:42.080\n how much it costs to live in Austin.\n\n09:42.960 --> 09:45.160\n I don't know how you resist that.\n\n09:45.160 --> 09:47.040\n Whenever I go to New York City,\n\n09:47.040 --> 09:50.720\n just the fact that there's a giant park in the middle of it,\n\n09:50.720 --> 09:53.240\n I wonder, how did they pull this off?\n\n09:53.240 --> 09:54.680\n This is amazing.\n\n09:54.680 --> 09:59.240\n It's like to resist the force of the increasing price\n\n09:59.240 --> 10:02.200\n of the land, and still to protect this idea\n\n10:02.200 --> 10:05.040\n of having a park.\n\n10:05.040 --> 10:08.560\n And then in the same way, protecting the ability\n\n10:08.560 --> 10:10.360\n for people from all walks of life to live\n\n10:10.360 --> 10:13.240\n in the center of the city, to live around the city,\n\n10:13.240 --> 10:16.880\n to chase a dream when they don't get any money\n\n10:16.880 --> 10:17.720\n in their pocket.\n\n10:17.720 --> 10:18.560\n Absolutely.\n\n10:18.560 --> 10:19.400\n I don't know how you do that.\n\n10:19.400 --> 10:22.280\n It's partly political, probably, regulation,\n\n10:22.280 --> 10:23.120\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n10:23.120 --> 10:25.800\n A lot of it has to do with regulations.\n\n10:25.800 --> 10:30.800\n And this is where her and I also very much see eye to eye\n\n10:31.120 --> 10:35.560\n in terms of the free markets and also prosperity building,\n\n10:35.560 --> 10:38.840\n because it's always the same problems most of the time,\n\n10:38.840 --> 10:40.200\n most places.\n\n10:40.200 --> 10:43.240\n Here, what you have is some people in the name of,\n\n10:43.240 --> 10:47.440\n we gotta stand for, and I don't like to use this word,\n\n10:47.440 --> 10:49.680\n but maybe you help me find a better one,\n\n10:49.680 --> 10:51.840\n but at least that's a word that people can understand.\n\n10:51.840 --> 10:54.440\n We gotta stand for the lesser fortunate among us.\n\n10:54.440 --> 10:57.040\n Some people would call them, maybe oftentimes use the word,\n\n10:57.040 --> 10:58.360\n maybe the underdogs, whatever it is.\n\n10:58.360 --> 11:01.400\n I will just say maybe the lesser fortunate among us, right?\n\n11:02.440 --> 11:04.280\n In the name of standing up for them,\n\n11:04.280 --> 11:07.640\n you're promoting policies that are actually gonna backfire\n\n11:07.640 --> 11:10.000\n and where they end up being the first ones\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.080\n to suffer from it.\n\n11:11.080 --> 11:14.040\n So let's take this whole housing issue\n\n11:14.040 --> 11:16.200\n that Nicole and her team are working on.\n\n11:17.360 --> 11:20.320\n We find that oftentimes the cost at the end of the day,\n\n11:20.320 --> 11:25.320\n it's the good old supply and demand equation.\n\n11:26.160 --> 11:29.280\n If you're gonna make it so hard\n\n11:29.280 --> 11:33.200\n that the supply level of housing remains\n\n11:33.200 --> 11:34.960\n below a certain threshold,\n\n11:34.960 --> 11:38.560\n remains lower than the demand of people who need,\n\n11:38.560 --> 11:41.480\n especially affordable housing, housing altogether,\n\n11:41.480 --> 11:45.600\n what's gonna happen is scarcity, prices go up,\n\n11:45.600 --> 11:47.360\n and who gets kicked out first?\n\n11:47.360 --> 11:49.360\n The lesser fortunate among us.\n\n11:49.360 --> 11:52.480\n And so, but I find that oftentimes people\n\n11:52.480 --> 11:55.400\n in the name of We Care don't engage their mind.\n\n11:55.400 --> 11:57.840\n And a friend of mine said this, and he said it so well.\n\n11:57.840 --> 12:02.840\n He said, having a heart for the poor, that's easy.\n\n12:03.360 --> 12:06.200\n Having a mind for the poor, that's the challenge.\n\n12:06.200 --> 12:09.920\n And oftentimes we all have a heart for the poor.\n\n12:09.920 --> 12:13.200\n But when it comes then to, then what do we do\n\n12:13.200 --> 12:17.000\n to have a real impact on making sure\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:20.800\n that people get a chance at going up,\n\n12:20.800 --> 12:23.280\n then that's where everything starts falling apart.\n\n12:23.280 --> 12:25.640\n And then you have people who,\n\n12:25.640 --> 12:28.480\n then they start pushing for policies, housing policies,\n\n12:28.480 --> 12:30.760\n making it super hard for you to even renovate\n\n12:30.760 --> 12:33.720\n or add one more store to your home or anything like that.\n\n12:33.720 --> 12:36.000\n By doing that, you're messing up with the supply,\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:39.120\n with the supply of housing.\n\n12:39.120 --> 12:43.000\n And therefore the people who can't afford,\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.080\n people get priced out of the market.\n\n12:45.080 --> 12:47.080\n And so what people like Nicole are doing\n\n12:47.080 --> 12:49.280\n are going back to where all of this is taking place\n\n12:49.280 --> 12:51.200\n and they're going back to the regulation side.\n\n12:51.200 --> 12:53.360\n And just like, I'm sure we'll talk about it here,\n\n12:53.360 --> 12:56.120\n but people wonder today, why is Africa\n\n12:56.120 --> 12:57.920\n the poorest region in the world?\n\n12:57.920 --> 12:59.960\n We go back to the same culprit.\n\n12:59.960 --> 13:04.560\n Bad laws and tons of senseless regulations.\n\n13:04.560 --> 13:06.920\n If you make it so hard that in Berkeley,\n\n13:06.920 --> 13:09.320\n for someone to build one more store to their home,\n\n13:09.320 --> 13:11.800\n which means maybe one more unit\n\n13:11.800 --> 13:13.360\n that could be rented out to someone.\n\n13:13.360 --> 13:14.560\n And if many more people do that,\n\n13:14.560 --> 13:16.520\n then you have a much bigger supply,\n\n13:16.520 --> 13:18.240\n which means the prices will go down,\n\n13:18.240 --> 13:20.680\n which means more people have access and among them,\n\n13:20.680 --> 13:22.880\n especially the lesser fortunate among us,\n\n13:22.880 --> 13:25.480\n then we're starting to see a winning proposal, aren't we?\n\n13:25.480 --> 13:27.360\n But instead, if you go the other way around,\n\n13:27.360 --> 13:29.320\n then all of a sudden you're pricing them out of the market.\n\n13:29.320 --> 13:30.320\n Same thing was done with us.\n\n13:30.320 --> 13:33.480\n So oftentimes when I see problems of this nature,\n\n13:33.480 --> 13:37.040\n you can betcha that regulations and census laws\n\n13:37.040 --> 13:37.880\n are the heart of it.\n\n13:37.880 --> 13:39.480\n And that's what they're tackling.\n\n13:39.480 --> 13:41.640\n It's not popular, it's not fun.\n\n13:41.640 --> 13:43.280\n And people tend to not even understand\n\n13:43.280 --> 13:44.440\n where you're coming from.\n\n13:44.440 --> 13:45.480\n But this is a problem we have\n\n13:45.480 --> 13:48.800\n with people not understanding economic econ 101.\n\n13:48.800 --> 13:50.440\n Well, so it's the regulation and the laws\n\n13:50.440 --> 13:51.760\n and the system that props them up\n\n13:51.760 --> 13:53.840\n and increases the span of those laws.\n\n13:53.840 --> 13:55.160\n And we'll talk about that,\n\n13:55.160 --> 13:57.880\n the fascinating way those kinds of things develop\n\n13:57.880 --> 13:59.680\n when it works, when it doesn't.\n\n13:59.680 --> 14:01.480\n Let me sort of step back\n\n14:01.480 --> 14:03.160\n and ask you a question about Africa.\n\n14:03.160 --> 14:06.920\n In the West, in many places in the world,\n\n14:06.920 --> 14:10.600\n Africa is almost talked about like it's one country,\n\n14:10.600 --> 14:12.200\n like it's one place.\n\n14:12.200 --> 14:16.640\n So in what ways is Africa one community?\n\n14:16.640 --> 14:20.040\n And in what ways is it many, many, many communities?\n\n14:20.040 --> 14:24.600\n Just from your perspective from in Senegal and beyond.\n\n14:24.600 --> 14:25.880\n Right.\n\n14:25.880 --> 14:30.880\n So at the most basic of what makes us one\n\n14:30.880 --> 14:33.240\n goes back to even what makes you African.\n\n14:33.240 --> 14:34.880\n You are African, I'm African.\n\n14:34.880 --> 14:36.440\n We're one big family.\n\n14:36.440 --> 14:38.240\n Africa is very much at the end of the day,\n\n14:38.240 --> 14:43.240\n the foundation and the birth of the human race.\n\n14:44.280 --> 14:47.600\n So from that standpoint, at the most basic level,\n\n14:47.600 --> 14:48.440\n we're all Africans.\n\n14:48.440 --> 14:50.040\n Where this whole thing started.\n\n14:50.040 --> 14:51.640\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n14:51.640 --> 14:53.160\n Where this whole thing started\n\n14:53.160 --> 14:56.600\n and how at some point humanity was hanging\n\n14:56.600 --> 14:57.600\n by its fingernails.\n\n14:57.600 --> 14:59.880\n Only 2000 of us were left on this earth.\n\n14:59.880 --> 15:02.200\n And eventually we started, we went for survival.\n\n15:02.200 --> 15:04.280\n And that's how we started to spread around\n\n15:04.280 --> 15:07.360\n and some going up north, some going this way, that way.\n\n15:07.360 --> 15:09.680\n And as you're traveling to different places\n\n15:09.680 --> 15:11.920\n then features start to change to adapt\n\n15:11.920 --> 15:13.640\n to where you are, right?\n\n15:13.640 --> 15:16.160\n So hair gets lighter for some people,\n\n15:16.160 --> 15:19.160\n eyes get different shape for others to adjust\n\n15:19.160 --> 15:21.280\n to our new natural habitat.\n\n15:21.280 --> 15:22.720\n You know, the genomics program,\n\n15:22.720 --> 15:26.960\n I think at the National Geographic did that so well\n\n15:26.960 --> 15:28.200\n for people who are interested in going back\n\n15:28.200 --> 15:30.320\n to that work with Spencer Wells and such.\n\n15:30.320 --> 15:34.040\n But yeah, so at the very basic, most basic level,\n\n15:34.040 --> 15:37.040\n that's what unites us all first of all.\n\n15:37.040 --> 15:41.560\n And then I would say that the continent, especially here\n\n15:41.560 --> 15:45.080\n I will group it into black Africa, you know, black Africa.\n\n15:47.480 --> 15:50.600\n Unfortunately our common stories, you know,\n\n15:50.600 --> 15:54.240\n of having gone through this terrible, horrible period\n\n15:54.240 --> 15:56.720\n of around the same time the whole continent being,\n\n15:56.720 --> 15:58.480\n you know, enslaved and colonized.\n\n15:58.480 --> 16:02.200\n So that in a way forms, not that we were ever\n\n16:02.200 --> 16:05.120\n the first people or only people ever, you know,\n\n16:05.120 --> 16:06.320\n enslaved in this world.\n\n16:06.320 --> 16:09.240\n As a matter of fact, I mean, the word slaves comes\n\n16:09.240 --> 16:13.320\n from esclav, you know, esclav, slave, slavs, les slavs,\n\n16:13.320 --> 16:15.040\n right, from the Eastern block.\n\n16:15.040 --> 16:17.000\n So the first slaves were actually people looking\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.360\n more like you than looking like me, right?\n\n16:19.360 --> 16:22.560\n So, but we don't necessarily remember all of that\n\n16:22.560 --> 16:27.560\n because in our human psyche, the closest to us in history\n\n16:28.160 --> 16:32.640\n of a big mass of people being enslaved is African people.\n\n16:32.640 --> 16:35.760\n We were the last, you know, group like that.\n\n16:35.760 --> 16:39.080\n You know, the pain of World War I and World War II\n\n16:39.080 --> 16:43.720\n permeates Europe, but it certainly does\n\n16:43.720 --> 16:46.360\n for the former Soviet Union, the countries\n\n16:46.360 --> 16:48.200\n that made up the former Soviet Union.\n\n16:48.200 --> 16:53.200\n Does in the same way, the pain of slavery\n\n16:56.760 --> 17:01.240\n and empires using Africa, does that permeate the culture?\n\n17:01.240 --> 17:02.960\n Is there still echoes of that?\n\n17:02.960 --> 17:06.440\n In a way, yes, especially the fact that, you know,\n\n17:06.440 --> 17:10.280\n in many different places, whether it's Ghana\n\n17:10.280 --> 17:15.080\n or my country or Benin, where you have these places\n\n17:15.080 --> 17:17.640\n that we call the door of no return or the places\n\n17:17.640 --> 17:22.440\n of no return, which this was the last place\n\n17:22.440 --> 17:25.800\n where the slaves were standing or, you know,\n\n17:25.800 --> 17:29.040\n this is in Senegal, we call it the door of no return.\n\n17:29.040 --> 17:31.680\n There is this one door, you're there in the slave house.\n\n17:31.680 --> 17:34.600\n And once they go, they go, that's it.\n\n17:34.600 --> 17:37.160\n That's gonna be the last time they see back home.\n\n17:38.600 --> 17:43.360\n So, you know, those, of course, of course,\n\n17:43.360 --> 17:48.360\n it creates for a common lived experience,\n\n17:48.680 --> 17:52.640\n which becomes a common lived history.\n\n17:54.720 --> 17:56.760\n And of course, it's gonna tire us up.\n\n17:56.760 --> 18:00.480\n Is there a resentment, because you mentioned hospitality,\n\n18:00.480 --> 18:03.520\n is there a kind of a resentment of the foreigner\n\n18:03.520 --> 18:07.040\n that there's a rich, vibrant land?\n\n18:07.040 --> 18:10.480\n There's many resources, there's powerful cultures.\n\n18:10.480 --> 18:14.000\n Are they just going to show up and use us?\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.960\n That's a way to see geopolitics in this modern world.\n\n18:16.960 --> 18:19.800\n This is, okay, so where it plays very differently is,\n\n18:19.800 --> 18:21.360\n so if you came to Senegal today,\n\n18:21.360 --> 18:23.960\n there is not really a problem at that level.\n\n18:23.960 --> 18:28.280\n Where people's resentment start to come from is,\n\n18:28.280 --> 18:31.160\n of course, when bad behavior shows up,\n\n18:31.160 --> 18:33.840\n meaning like you have so many white people who can show up\n\n18:33.840 --> 18:35.320\n and just in the attitude,\n\n18:35.320 --> 18:38.640\n they have an entitlement attitude, right?\n\n18:38.640 --> 18:43.240\n And they think that in a way, we're all still servants.\n\n18:43.240 --> 18:46.080\n Some people in your face, some people more,\n\n18:46.080 --> 18:48.320\n but that can cause some little resentment,\n\n18:48.320 --> 18:50.160\n but where really the resentment is.\n\n18:51.320 --> 18:53.520\n And that can, the entitlement can take different forms,\n\n18:53.520 --> 18:55.160\n like even pity.\n\n18:55.160 --> 18:57.440\n Yes, don't even get me going on that one.\n\n18:57.440 --> 18:59.120\n I was trying to be polite today.\n\n18:59.120 --> 19:01.840\n So just don't, Lex, do not.\n\n19:01.840 --> 19:03.080\n You know, sometimes I tell myself,\n\n19:03.080 --> 19:04.760\n my God, today you're going to be all composed.\n\n19:04.760 --> 19:06.720\n You know, Lex is all composed.\n\n19:06.720 --> 19:08.280\n So don't go there and make a fool of yourself.\n\n19:08.280 --> 19:09.320\n Just behave.\n\n19:09.320 --> 19:12.400\n But if you get me on some grounds,\n\n19:12.400 --> 19:15.120\n that's when it's all going to go to hell.\n\n19:15.120 --> 19:17.840\n So yeah, let's move beyond that too.\n\n19:17.840 --> 19:20.080\n So resentment, there's a dance\n\n19:20.080 --> 19:21.440\n between hospitality and resentment.\n\n19:21.440 --> 19:22.400\n And resentment.\n\n19:22.400 --> 19:25.240\n So when you come in, you're you, you live your life.\n\n19:25.240 --> 19:26.840\n You're just a normal human being\n\n19:26.840 --> 19:27.880\n and you treat me decently\n\n19:27.880 --> 19:30.120\n like you would treat a friend, normal people.\n\n19:30.120 --> 19:31.200\n I have no problem with you.\n\n19:31.200 --> 19:32.280\n I'm not going to come back and be like,\n\n19:32.280 --> 19:35.680\n well, you and your ancestors have enslaved me.\n\n19:35.680 --> 19:38.240\n You, you're not going to see that stuff.\n\n19:38.240 --> 19:40.520\n Sometimes I'm in this country where I feel like that's,\n\n19:40.520 --> 19:42.560\n you know, it might look like that,\n\n19:42.560 --> 19:45.560\n but we in Africa don't do that.\n\n19:45.560 --> 19:48.640\n Now, if you come, you have this nasty attitude.\n\n19:48.640 --> 19:50.240\n You think you're still serving servants around.\n\n19:50.240 --> 19:52.000\n Well, you can have a problem with someone like me.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\n I might even grab you by the back of your neck\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.040\n and, you know, take you back to the airport.\n\n19:56.040 --> 19:57.240\n That's when you're lucky.\n\n19:58.560 --> 19:59.960\n I'll be you very quickly.\n\n19:59.960 --> 20:00.800\n Exactly.\n\n20:00.800 --> 20:05.000\n But where things come up is,\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.760\n especially nowadays with the African youth,\n\n20:07.760 --> 20:10.520\n when we have to be reminded of the World Bank,\n\n20:10.520 --> 20:13.360\n when we have to be reminded of even the world,\n\n20:13.360 --> 20:14.640\n places like the World Economic Forum,\n\n20:14.640 --> 20:17.640\n you know, like all of these places that seem to constitute,\n\n20:19.880 --> 20:22.120\n they would, the way they describe them,\n\n20:22.120 --> 20:26.200\n when I say they, it's primarily my Pan African friends.\n\n20:26.200 --> 20:29.280\n So here maybe terms are worth describing.\n\n20:30.480 --> 20:35.480\n So the Pan African movement goes way back when,\n\n20:37.280 --> 20:39.680\n we're talking about, you know, way back when,\n\n20:39.680 --> 20:44.680\n started in the thirties going on all the way from there.\n\n20:44.760 --> 20:47.800\n So what you have there is people\n\n20:47.800 --> 20:50.680\n who have started coming together\n\n20:50.680 --> 20:54.240\n and dreaming up an emancipated Africa\n\n20:54.240 --> 20:55.840\n away from the colonies,\n\n20:55.840 --> 20:57.960\n because at that point there were still colonies\n\n20:57.960 --> 20:59.440\n and dreaming up all of that.\n\n20:59.440 --> 21:02.560\n So we're talking about people like Kwame Kuma of Ghana,\n\n21:02.560 --> 21:04.840\n we're talking about Julius Nyerere of Tanzania,\n\n21:04.840 --> 21:06.920\n talking about Blaise Diagne of Senegal\n\n21:06.920 --> 21:09.520\n and other people like that, Bandi of Malawi.\n\n21:09.520 --> 21:12.960\n So anyway, so, and the African youth of today,\n\n21:12.960 --> 21:15.240\n we're still hanging on to those,\n\n21:15.240 --> 21:16.800\n onto some of these ideas of,\n\n21:16.800 --> 21:19.880\n and on some of these dreams of a reunited Africa.\n\n21:19.880 --> 21:22.880\n So when you were talking about what seems to unite you,\n\n21:22.880 --> 21:25.200\n there is that, you know, also,\n\n21:25.200 --> 21:27.960\n meaning like we all feel like we're part of the same family.\n\n21:27.960 --> 21:29.320\n Is it only in our heads?\n\n21:29.320 --> 21:30.160\n Is it in reality?\n\n21:30.160 --> 21:31.640\n Many, for many different reasons,\n\n21:31.640 --> 21:34.400\n there is definitely what we call a Pan African movement.\n\n21:34.400 --> 21:38.400\n And I very much myself, consider myself one of them.\n\n21:38.400 --> 21:40.480\n I don't agree all the time with our,\n\n21:40.480 --> 21:42.880\n where we want to go and how we want to go there,\n\n21:42.880 --> 21:45.320\n but not where we want to go.\n\n21:45.320 --> 21:46.920\n Where we want to go is we would love to see\n\n21:46.920 --> 21:48.640\n a united Africa for sure.\n\n21:48.640 --> 21:50.360\n But how to get that accomplished,\n\n21:50.360 --> 21:52.440\n that's where oftentimes we have issues.\n\n21:52.440 --> 21:54.440\n So on something like that,\n\n21:55.440 --> 21:57.760\n so this Pan African, especially the Pan African youth,\n\n21:57.760 --> 21:59.840\n but it's beyond the Pan African youth,\n\n21:59.840 --> 22:02.440\n it's the youth in general in Africa,\n\n22:02.440 --> 22:04.960\n World Bank, UN, all of these organizations\n\n22:04.960 --> 22:09.600\n that they tend to qualify as imperialist organizations.\n\n22:09.600 --> 22:12.320\n And it's not always a correct way to describe them,\n\n22:12.320 --> 22:14.440\n but I'm sure you get the sentiment.\n\n22:14.440 --> 22:19.440\n And from that place, there is tons of resentment\n\n22:19.800 --> 22:22.000\n because for the longest time,\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.680\n these groups, organizations,\n\n22:24.680 --> 22:27.160\n and some that preceded them,\n\n22:27.160 --> 22:30.600\n have proceeded to actually decide\n\n22:30.600 --> 22:32.600\n what even our new frontiers would be.\n\n22:33.520 --> 22:35.640\n You see, when you go to a place like Senegal,\n\n22:35.640 --> 22:37.720\n Mali, all of that, different countries,\n\n22:37.720 --> 22:39.040\n but we were one people,\n\n22:40.160 --> 22:42.400\n one group, one kingdom.\n\n22:42.400 --> 22:45.400\n And then at some point they decided just,\n\n22:45.400 --> 22:46.240\n when you look at Africa,\n\n22:46.240 --> 22:48.960\n have you looked at how straight some of these borders are?\n\n22:48.960 --> 22:51.320\n You're like, did a robot just draw these?\n\n22:51.320 --> 22:52.160\n Really?\n\n22:52.160 --> 22:53.000\n No offense to robots.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.520\n No offense to robot, especially this one,\n\n22:54.520 --> 22:55.400\n he looks so cute.\n\n22:55.400 --> 22:56.520\n But you know what I mean?\n\n22:56.520 --> 23:01.520\n So they have continued deciding\n\n23:02.680 --> 23:06.440\n what it would be to be us,\n\n23:06.440 --> 23:08.440\n to live on our land,\n\n23:08.440 --> 23:10.240\n and how do we even progress?\n\n23:10.240 --> 23:11.880\n And it just keeps on going.\n\n23:11.880 --> 23:16.800\n They get to decide how are we gonna,\n\n23:16.800 --> 23:19.120\n which type of even economic development path\n\n23:19.120 --> 23:20.440\n are we gonna choose or not?\n\n23:20.440 --> 23:22.600\n So it's very, so from that standpoint,\n\n23:22.600 --> 23:23.920\n yes, there's a lot of resentment,\n\n23:23.920 --> 23:25.680\n including even from people like me.\n\n23:25.680 --> 23:27.520\n Yeah, and it's interesting that the invader\n\n23:27.520 --> 23:29.520\n and the oppressor and the empires\n\n23:29.520 --> 23:33.240\n have actually created a force for unity.\n\n23:33.240 --> 23:36.920\n I've seen that in Ukraine and the invasion of Ukraine,\n\n23:36.920 --> 23:38.760\n where it was a pretty divided,\n\n23:38.760 --> 23:41.680\n not a pretty, a very divided country with many factions.\n\n23:41.680 --> 23:45.800\n But the invasion really forced everyone to think\n\n23:45.800 --> 23:48.760\n about the identity of this nation together,\n\n23:48.760 --> 23:51.200\n beyond factions, beyond all of that.\n\n23:51.200 --> 23:54.800\n It allowed it to look at its history and its future.\n\n23:54.800 --> 23:57.520\n Like they all say that all great nations\n\n23:57.520 --> 24:00.560\n have had to have a war of independence.\n\n24:00.560 --> 24:04.640\n And this is our war to find our own identity.\n\n24:04.640 --> 24:09.360\n And so in that sense, Africa as one place,\n\n24:09.360 --> 24:14.360\n as one continent had to find multiple times its identity\n\n24:14.800 --> 24:17.200\n through the resistance of the oppressor.\n\n24:17.200 --> 24:18.840\n Especially subterranean Africa,\n\n24:18.840 --> 24:20.680\n especially subterranean Africa, yes.\n\n24:20.680 --> 24:22.080\n And there's an interesting aspect to this\n\n24:22.080 --> 24:23.920\n because the president of Senegal is also\n\n24:23.920 --> 24:26.880\n the head of the African Union.\n\n24:26.880 --> 24:30.120\n So we'll talk about the fascinating geopolitics\n\n24:30.120 --> 24:33.520\n of that whole situation.\n\n24:33.520 --> 24:36.120\n But let me ask in general,\n\n24:36.120 --> 24:41.120\n you talk about this question, this fascinating question,\n\n24:41.200 --> 24:43.440\n what does it take for a country to prosper?\n\n24:44.880 --> 24:48.000\n What does it take for a country to prosper?\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:51.960\n You see many countries in the world that really struggle\n\n24:51.960 --> 24:54.520\n and many that flourish.\n\n24:54.520 --> 24:56.880\n And it's not always obvious why\n\n24:56.880 --> 25:00.360\n because some have natural resources, some don't.\n\n25:00.360 --> 25:04.960\n Some have wars, some don't.\n\n25:04.960 --> 25:09.960\n Some have sort of authoritarian regimes, some don't.\n\n25:11.080 --> 25:13.480\n And some have democracies and all that kind of stuff.\n\n25:13.480 --> 25:16.160\n So the dynamics aren't exactly obvious.\n\n25:16.160 --> 25:18.200\n Is there commonalities?\n\n25:18.200 --> 25:22.720\n Is there fundamental ideas that result\n\n25:22.720 --> 25:24.800\n in a prosperity of a nation?\n\n25:24.800 --> 25:27.440\n Today, I can confidently say yes,\n\n25:27.440 --> 25:29.880\n despite all the differences that you talked about.\n\n25:29.880 --> 25:33.320\n And I think then this is where it becomes very important\n\n25:33.320 --> 25:37.320\n that we are very clear about the question you asked me.\n\n25:37.320 --> 25:41.720\n You said, what does it take to make a country prosperous?\n\n25:41.720 --> 25:44.240\n So I'm just gonna stick to prosperity\n\n25:44.240 --> 25:46.960\n because prosperity doesn't necessarily mean,\n\n25:46.960 --> 25:50.080\n sometimes it has nothing to do with maybe how\n\n25:50.080 --> 25:55.080\n you conduct yourself otherwise, socially speaking, right?\n\n25:56.080 --> 25:58.680\n So you can be prosperous.\n\n25:58.680 --> 26:02.080\n And still when it comes to your family laws,\n\n26:02.080 --> 26:04.560\n all the way you approach the other aspects of your life,\n\n26:04.560 --> 26:07.760\n maybe you're running a very communist lifestyle\n\n26:08.960 --> 26:13.960\n or you're in a very liberal society.\n\n26:14.760 --> 26:16.560\n So for me, when we talk about prosperity,\n\n26:16.560 --> 26:18.480\n I just want to make sure that we're clear on that\n\n26:18.480 --> 26:19.920\n because some people might say that,\n\n26:19.920 --> 26:21.400\n might be somewhere and be like,\n\n26:21.400 --> 26:25.000\n well, because I know what I'm gonna talk to you about next.\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:26.080\n And some people are gonna sit there and be like,\n\n26:26.080 --> 26:27.640\n well, China is not like that.\n\n26:27.640 --> 26:32.560\n Or even Dubai is not like that.\n\n26:32.560 --> 26:34.520\n No, so what I'm talking about is this thing.\n\n26:34.520 --> 26:35.600\n And that's what I love about this.\n\n26:35.600 --> 26:37.600\n If we just stick to the word prosperity.\n\n26:37.600 --> 26:38.920\n To me, I see prosperity as this.\n\n26:38.920 --> 26:40.400\n It's like, economically speaking,\n\n26:40.400 --> 26:43.040\n what are we gonna be to be a prosperous nation?\n\n26:43.040 --> 26:46.680\n Meaning we are a middle to high income nation.\n\n26:46.680 --> 26:50.160\n I'm not talking about what are the rights of your women\n\n26:50.160 --> 26:54.200\n to vote or can people live like this?\n\n26:54.200 --> 26:56.600\n Or I'm not talking about any of that.\n\n26:56.600 --> 27:00.200\n Economic, fundamentally economic prosperity.\n\n27:00.200 --> 27:01.960\n Because I think that distinction is very important\n\n27:01.960 --> 27:03.000\n because over the years,\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.200\n I've seen people push back on all types of things\n\n27:05.200 --> 27:06.320\n and it occurred to me\n\n27:06.320 --> 27:08.720\n that that's what the misunderstanding was there.\n\n27:08.720 --> 27:11.120\n So if we're gonna talk about prosperity,\n\n27:11.120 --> 27:13.160\n making sure that the country can make money\n\n27:13.160 --> 27:15.000\n so that it can take care of its needs\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.320\n and the needs of its citizens,\n\n27:17.320 --> 27:22.320\n then what I have come to find is that at the root of that\n\n27:22.640 --> 27:25.400\n is gonna be what we call economic freedom\n\n27:25.400 --> 27:28.280\n and what I call the toolkit of the entrepreneur.\n\n27:28.280 --> 27:30.360\n In that you can put the rule of law,\n\n27:30.360 --> 27:32.120\n you can put the concept of clear\n\n27:32.120 --> 27:34.080\n and transferable property rights.\n\n27:34.960 --> 27:37.840\n Economic freedom is at all the levels\n\n27:37.840 --> 27:41.600\n that which will allow entrepreneurs\n\n27:42.600 --> 27:46.960\n and business people to create value\n\n27:46.960 --> 27:48.840\n and create value entrepreneurially.\n\n27:48.840 --> 27:51.040\n We're not talking about rent seeking or anything like that.\n\n27:51.040 --> 27:53.400\n It's like you found a pie to be this big\n\n27:53.400 --> 27:55.680\n and you make it this big.\n\n27:55.680 --> 27:56.640\n So that's what we're talking about.\n\n27:56.640 --> 27:57.560\n Create value.\n\n27:57.560 --> 27:59.600\n Create value, yes.\n\n28:00.560 --> 28:02.560\n So when it comes to that,\n\n28:02.560 --> 28:07.360\n we have found that whether you're looking at two countries\n\n28:07.360 --> 28:08.520\n that start out the same,\n\n28:08.520 --> 28:10.240\n we're talking the same people,\n\n28:10.240 --> 28:12.760\n East Germany, West Germany,\n\n28:12.760 --> 28:15.000\n South Korea, North Korea,\n\n28:15.920 --> 28:18.960\n very similar people to start with, right?\n\n28:18.960 --> 28:23.840\n But yet radical outcomes.\n\n28:23.840 --> 28:26.040\n I know that today Germany is united,\n\n28:26.040 --> 28:27.440\n but we're talking about back in the days\n\n28:27.440 --> 28:29.320\n when you had East and Western block.\n\n28:30.480 --> 28:32.720\n Same people, very different outcomes.\n\n28:32.720 --> 28:35.760\n Like I said, South Korea, North Korea,\n\n28:35.760 --> 28:36.800\n and so on and so forth.\n\n28:36.800 --> 28:39.800\n And at the same time, very different nations.\n\n28:40.720 --> 28:45.720\n Dubai compared to Singapore or to England,\n\n28:45.720 --> 28:48.800\n very different yet the same outcome.\n\n28:48.800 --> 28:51.880\n So it seems to me like whenever we're looking at prosperity,\n\n28:51.880 --> 28:53.800\n if a nation is prosperous,\n\n28:53.800 --> 28:57.160\n regardless of whatever other shenanigan\n\n28:57.160 --> 28:58.120\n they might be running,\n\n28:58.120 --> 29:01.280\n whatever other operating software\n\n29:01.280 --> 29:03.080\n they might be running for anything\n\n29:03.080 --> 29:05.600\n that's not related to business,\n\n29:05.600 --> 29:07.400\n if on the business side,\n\n29:08.200 --> 29:11.200\n they are proponents of a free markets\n\n29:11.200 --> 29:16.200\n or at least a base level of free markets,\n\n29:16.600 --> 29:19.880\n we know that such countries will create prosperity.\n\n29:19.880 --> 29:21.760\n So what are the aspects of the operating systems\n\n29:21.760 --> 29:25.240\n that lead to Singapore and to South Korea\n\n29:25.240 --> 29:26.200\n and all that kind of stuff?\n\n29:26.200 --> 29:28.440\n So can you speak to different elements\n\n29:28.440 --> 29:30.320\n that enable the toolkit for entrepreneurs?\n\n29:30.320 --> 29:31.800\n Sure, sure.\n\n29:31.800 --> 29:33.200\n And maybe here,\n\n29:34.080 --> 29:36.560\n let me just maybe illustrate it with my own story\n\n29:36.560 --> 29:38.640\n and then I can take you back to...\n\n29:38.640 --> 29:39.480\n Yeah, what's your...\n\n29:39.480 --> 29:42.480\n Oh my God, tell us your story.\n\n29:42.480 --> 29:43.320\n No, no.\n\n29:43.320 --> 29:44.160\n Who are you?\n\n29:44.160 --> 29:45.640\n It's just because it started with me coming here.\n\n29:45.640 --> 29:46.720\n You showed me the robot and everything\n\n29:46.720 --> 29:49.000\n and now it looks like we know each other for too long.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:50.800\n And then you're like, tell people.\n\n29:50.800 --> 29:51.640\n No, no, no.\n\n29:51.640 --> 29:54.720\n But so this is where this question,\n\n29:54.720 --> 29:55.760\n even when you asked me,\n\n29:55.760 --> 29:59.160\n how do some countries become prosperous?\n\n30:00.160 --> 30:05.160\n That question, Lex, I had it when I was seven or so.\n\n30:05.160 --> 30:09.440\n That's when my family moved me to South Korea\n\n30:09.440 --> 30:12.120\n to from Senegal for the first time of my life,\n\n30:12.120 --> 30:14.400\n I left my country, I left my continent\n\n30:14.400 --> 30:17.360\n and I was headed to Europe to go join my people,\n\n30:17.360 --> 30:21.800\n my family, my parents who were there as economic migrants.\n\n30:21.800 --> 30:24.600\n My parents had migrated for a better life\n\n30:24.600 --> 30:27.080\n as so many people have to,\n\n30:27.080 --> 30:29.880\n so many people have to coming from poorer places,\n\n30:29.880 --> 30:31.360\n coming from low income countries.\n\n30:31.360 --> 30:32.680\n You saw the difference?\n\n30:32.680 --> 30:33.520\n Yes.\n\n30:33.520 --> 30:34.680\n Between the two places.\n\n30:35.800 --> 30:37.240\n How else would you call it?\n\n30:37.240 --> 30:38.960\n Here you are in Senegal,\n\n30:38.960 --> 30:40.120\n minding your own business,\n\n30:40.120 --> 30:42.160\n causing tons of trouble everywhere,\n\n30:42.160 --> 30:45.440\n just being a happy free wrench kid that I was.\n\n30:45.440 --> 30:48.440\n Yeah, so you were always a troublemaker, not just now.\n\n30:48.440 --> 30:49.280\n Okay, great.\n\n30:49.280 --> 30:50.120\n Life wouldn't be fun without it.\n\n30:50.120 --> 30:51.680\n Yeah, of course, I agree.\n\n30:51.680 --> 30:52.520\n Right?\n\n30:52.520 --> 30:53.360\n So, because even you,\n\n30:53.360 --> 30:55.720\n and you're all put together front,\n\n30:55.720 --> 30:57.920\n I know there's a lot of troublemaking behind you.\n\n30:57.920 --> 30:59.840\n Desperately trying to keep it together.\n\n30:59.840 --> 31:01.280\n I know you are, but with me,\n\n31:01.280 --> 31:02.600\n I'm gonna totally bring it out.\n\n31:02.600 --> 31:03.920\n So just, yeah.\n\n31:03.920 --> 31:04.760\n So.\n\n31:04.760 --> 31:05.600\n So you saw the difference.\n\n31:05.600 --> 31:06.600\n Right, I saw the difference.\n\n31:06.600 --> 31:09.320\n I'm walking in here, back home,\n\n31:09.320 --> 31:10.360\n and I tell people this story\n\n31:10.360 --> 31:13.400\n because to me it's a defining story.\n\n31:13.400 --> 31:18.240\n Back home, to take a shower, it takes time.\n\n31:18.240 --> 31:21.760\n Grandma has to make the charcoal catch\n\n31:21.760 --> 31:25.680\n on a little stove like you use when you go camping.\n\n31:25.680 --> 31:28.640\n And then she puts a pot of water on it, it boils.\n\n31:28.640 --> 31:30.640\n She takes it, puts it in a bigger bucket,\n\n31:30.640 --> 31:32.400\n mixes it with some colder water.\n\n31:32.400 --> 31:34.400\n Then we put a little pot in it,\n\n31:34.400 --> 31:36.080\n and a stronger member of the family\n\n31:36.080 --> 31:37.720\n has to drag it to the shower.\n\n31:37.720 --> 31:40.760\n And then there, finally, I can proceed to take my shower.\n\n31:42.040 --> 31:43.760\n Here I'm in Germany in the middle of the winter,\n\n31:43.760 --> 31:44.600\n and my mom's like,\n\n31:44.600 --> 31:45.680\n my god, time for your shower.\n\n31:45.680 --> 31:47.400\n I'm like, I'm not getting naked.\n\n31:47.400 --> 31:48.240\n Where is the bottle?\n\n31:48.240 --> 31:51.240\n Where is the bucket of hot water?\n\n31:51.240 --> 31:53.640\n She's like, oh, you silly, come on, just jump in.\n\n31:53.640 --> 31:55.760\n And I jump in the shower, turn the buttons,\n\n31:55.760 --> 31:56.960\n the water is coming down temperature.\n\n31:56.960 --> 31:58.280\n I'm like playing with.\n\n31:58.280 --> 32:00.240\n It's like, are you kidding me?\n\n32:00.240 --> 32:01.080\n So amazing.\n\n32:01.080 --> 32:03.520\n I've been cheated out of life my whole life.\n\n32:03.520 --> 32:05.040\n So that's what happened.\n\n32:05.040 --> 32:08.480\n And then I'm like, oh, and all of these roads,\n\n32:08.480 --> 32:09.360\n they're paved roads.\n\n32:09.360 --> 32:11.920\n And like back home, everything is like sandy,\n\n32:11.920 --> 32:13.640\n and my feet are always ash.\n\n32:13.640 --> 32:16.160\n I always have to wash off when I go back home,\n\n32:16.160 --> 32:18.480\n and your shoes get ruined most of the time.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.200\n And it started, and I had this question,\n\n32:22.200 --> 32:25.160\n and it was just like, wow, how come they have this?\n\n32:25.160 --> 32:26.720\n And we don't.\n\n32:26.720 --> 32:28.840\n So I was not being like, oh, you know,\n\n32:28.840 --> 32:30.440\n how come they have all of this money?\n\n32:30.440 --> 32:32.600\n I was not, it was just like, how come?\n\n32:32.600 --> 32:34.760\n And I think what I was alluding to was,\n\n32:34.760 --> 32:39.240\n how come life is so easy here, and back home it's not?\n\n32:39.240 --> 32:43.240\n And easy, not in a negative sense, in a beautiful sense.\n\n32:43.240 --> 32:46.200\n Sometimes I get, you know, just having traveled\n\n32:46.200 --> 32:48.120\n through the war zone, just to come back,\n\n32:48.120 --> 32:50.640\n traveling through Europe, back to America,\n\n32:50.640 --> 32:53.040\n it just, I'll just get emotional just looking\n\n32:53.040 --> 32:56.520\n at the efficiency of things, like how easy it is,\n\n32:56.520 --> 33:00.400\n how we can, first of all, in Ukraine,\n\n33:00.400 --> 33:02.320\n you currently can't fly, right?\n\n33:02.320 --> 33:03.200\n It's a war zone.\n\n33:03.200 --> 33:06.360\n Just even the transportation, you said roads.\n\n33:06.360 --> 33:09.480\n Yeah, the quality of roads in the United States is amazing.\n\n33:09.480 --> 33:11.680\n Just not, you know, many of the places\n\n33:11.680 --> 33:14.880\n that drive in Ukraine, you're talking about,\n\n33:14.880 --> 33:19.240\n I mean, really bad conditions of roads.\n\n33:19.240 --> 33:21.240\n And I'm sure in many parts of Africa\n\n33:21.240 --> 33:23.680\n and many parts of the world, the roads are even worse.\n\n33:23.680 --> 33:24.680\n Right, right.\n\n33:24.680 --> 33:28.320\n And outdoor, you know, having an indoor toilet\n\n33:28.320 --> 33:32.400\n is a fascinatingly awesome luxury to have.\n\n33:32.400 --> 33:33.600\n It is, it is.\n\n33:33.600 --> 33:35.400\n And don't take me wrong, Lex.\n\n33:35.400 --> 33:40.400\n Do we have some great roads now in many parts of Africa?\n\n33:41.360 --> 33:44.040\n Yes, main arteries, great roads,\n\n33:44.040 --> 33:45.760\n you're like, whoa, this is moving.\n\n33:46.880 --> 33:48.640\n Yes, we do.\n\n33:48.640 --> 33:52.600\n But definitely more today than in my time growing up.\n\n33:53.960 --> 33:58.120\n Do we have, you know, a country like Nigeria\n\n33:58.120 --> 34:02.200\n that just birthed six unicorns last year alone?\n\n34:02.200 --> 34:03.200\n Yes.\n\n34:03.200 --> 34:06.440\n Do we have the African youth out there\n\n34:06.440 --> 34:10.080\n being so amazing and, you know, living their lives?\n\n34:10.080 --> 34:12.440\n Yes, we have all of that.\n\n34:12.440 --> 34:14.760\n But it is still, unfortunately,\n\n34:14.760 --> 34:18.320\n just like we're scratching the surface.\n\n34:18.320 --> 34:21.360\n And those people still are getting all of that accomplished\n\n34:21.360 --> 34:23.320\n literally swimming through molasses.\n\n34:23.320 --> 34:27.120\n This is some of the most gross,\n\n34:27.120 --> 34:32.120\n immoral, unfair waste of human capital.\n\n34:35.840 --> 34:40.840\n And so that is the, started with you as a seven year old\n\n34:41.360 --> 34:43.320\n asking, wait a minute,\n\n34:43.320 --> 34:48.320\n how do amazing people in Europe do this\n\n34:48.320 --> 34:50.560\n and the amazing people in Africa don't?\n\n34:50.560 --> 34:52.200\n Yeah, and that's a key word, amazing.\n\n34:52.200 --> 34:55.160\n Because that's what I realized later\n\n34:55.160 --> 34:57.520\n because it was not always like that for me,\n\n34:57.520 --> 34:59.160\n amazing and amazing, right?\n\n34:59.160 --> 35:02.720\n I knew instinctively that of course we are amazing too.\n\n35:02.720 --> 35:06.960\n But so eventually the question became how,\n\n35:06.960 --> 35:09.440\n so I went from how come they have this and we don't\n\n35:09.440 --> 35:11.840\n to the country as I'm growing up and researching\n\n35:11.840 --> 35:12.960\n because it stayed with me.\n\n35:12.960 --> 35:14.880\n When I tell you I'm obsessed, I'm haunted.\n\n35:14.880 --> 35:16.000\n I am haunted.\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:18.520\n So you can laugh all you want, but it's,\n\n35:19.680 --> 35:23.080\n so the question became, the question became,\n\n35:23.080 --> 35:27.760\n how come some countries like the United States,\n\n35:27.760 --> 35:32.600\n Singapore are rich and some others like mine\n\n35:32.600 --> 35:35.040\n and many others in Africa are poor?\n\n35:35.040 --> 35:37.000\n That became the question.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:41.280\n And along the line, like along the road,\n\n35:41.280 --> 35:44.720\n I continued on living my life, wondering about this question.\n\n35:45.840 --> 35:50.400\n And I've heard all types of reasons\n\n35:50.400 --> 35:53.840\n as to supposedly why that might be the case.\n\n35:53.840 --> 35:56.120\n Some people with a very straight face\n\n35:56.120 --> 36:00.360\n are still peddling the IQ fury, according to which,\n\n36:00.360 --> 36:03.000\n come on, darling, it's not your fault.\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.520\n You know, your skin color goes with a gene sequence\n\n36:05.520 --> 36:07.840\n that just doesn't allow you to be as smart\n\n36:07.840 --> 36:09.880\n as white people are.\n\n36:09.880 --> 36:12.920\n And it's not your fault, but just accept it.\n\n36:12.920 --> 36:14.320\n That stuff is still out there.\n\n36:14.320 --> 36:15.160\n It's very real.\n\n36:16.040 --> 36:17.800\n I and I have to hear it.\n\n36:17.800 --> 36:21.240\n And others would say to me, oh, it's just because,\n\n36:21.240 --> 36:25.480\n you know, you guys don't have adequate level of education.\n\n36:25.480 --> 36:28.240\n And I say, you know, maybe you gotta go say that\n\n36:29.400 --> 36:33.160\n to most of the street sellers you go see in Senegal.\n\n36:33.160 --> 36:34.520\n You go up to any of these,\n\n36:34.520 --> 36:37.680\n to many of these street sellers in Senegal,\n\n36:37.680 --> 36:41.800\n they are wading through cars and moving cars\n\n36:41.800 --> 36:48.160\n under the hot sun, fumes thrown at their face,\n\n36:48.160 --> 36:51.800\n trying to sell you anything that you think\n\n36:51.800 --> 36:53.400\n you might be able to use.\n\n36:53.400 --> 36:56.920\n Whether we're talking about an ironing board\n\n36:56.920 --> 36:59.800\n to an umbrella, to Q tips,\n\n36:59.800 --> 37:02.880\n to, you know, toothpicks,\n\n37:02.880 --> 37:04.840\n selling you whatever you need from your car,\n\n37:04.840 --> 37:06.400\n these are street sellers.\n\n37:06.400 --> 37:10.800\n And you ask them, dear, do you have any degree?\n\n37:10.800 --> 37:14.520\n Yeah, I have this great degree in math\n\n37:14.520 --> 37:17.560\n or in literature or whatever.\n\n37:17.560 --> 37:20.280\n Some very, very educated people.\n\n37:20.280 --> 37:22.520\n Yet they're right there, this is what they're doing.\n\n37:22.520 --> 37:27.520\n So that's just at scale wasted human potential.\n\n37:28.560 --> 37:29.400\n Thank you.\n\n37:29.400 --> 37:32.440\n So that has to do, the wasted human potential\n\n37:32.440 --> 37:35.000\n has to do now with the system,\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.320\n with something about the laws.\n\n37:37.320 --> 37:38.880\n Which is, yeah.\n\n37:38.880 --> 37:43.560\n Something about sort of the things that limit\n\n37:43.560 --> 37:45.680\n or enable the entrepreneur.\n\n37:45.680 --> 37:48.880\n Yes, because at that point I've heard this,\n\n37:48.880 --> 37:50.360\n you know, I heard people say,\n\n37:50.360 --> 37:52.520\n yeah, your IQ is no good.\n\n37:52.520 --> 37:54.440\n Yeah, you don't have enough degrees\n\n37:54.440 --> 37:56.000\n or you're not educated.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:57.280\n Yeah, some people would even say,\n\n37:57.280 --> 37:58.680\n it's because you guys are malnourished,\n\n37:58.680 --> 38:01.400\n you're malnourished, you need to be fed.\n\n38:01.400 --> 38:03.800\n Others, oh, well, maybe I'll give you some shoes\n\n38:03.800 --> 38:06.000\n and maybe something is gonna change, whatever.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:08.840\n And then, so I heard all of this nonsense, Lex,\n\n38:08.840 --> 38:09.920\n but you guess what, but guess what?\n\n38:09.920 --> 38:10.760\n None of them made sense.\n\n38:10.760 --> 38:12.040\n You know why it didn't make sense?\n\n38:12.040 --> 38:14.600\n Because if any of that crap was true,\n\n38:14.600 --> 38:19.080\n why, oh, why is it that my parents\n\n38:19.080 --> 38:22.720\n or any other people from these places,\n\n38:22.720 --> 38:23.960\n and oh, and by the way,\n\n38:23.960 --> 38:28.080\n some people call those places God forsaken land.\n\n38:28.080 --> 38:31.480\n That's also the type of cred you always have to hear\n\n38:31.480 --> 38:33.280\n when it's not just flat out,\n\n38:33.280 --> 38:36.360\n SHIT whole countries from, you know,\n\n38:36.360 --> 38:40.240\n one person a few years ago, president of this country.\n\n38:40.240 --> 38:42.520\n That sentiment is sometimes there.\n\n38:42.520 --> 38:44.240\n It is, it is.\n\n38:44.240 --> 38:45.600\n As I go on with my life,\n\n38:45.600 --> 38:48.560\n trying to find the answer to why are some countries\n\n38:48.560 --> 38:50.160\n like mine poor while others are rich,\n\n38:50.160 --> 38:53.000\n I'm hearing all of these reasons thrown at me.\n\n38:53.880 --> 38:57.440\n And then they make no sense because then how come then\n\n38:57.440 --> 39:01.800\n if my parents move as it is usually anyone else\n\n39:01.800 --> 39:04.920\n who moves from a poorer nation\n\n39:04.920 --> 39:07.040\n to a nation that supposedly is rich,\n\n39:07.040 --> 39:11.640\n all of a sudden they get to manifest the greatest potential.\n\n39:12.560 --> 39:14.280\n So I'm starting to think this has nothing to do\n\n39:14.280 --> 39:16.080\n with a person per se,\n\n39:16.080 --> 39:17.600\n because we're talking about the same person,\n\n39:17.600 --> 39:20.960\n same background, same name, features, everything.\n\n39:20.960 --> 39:22.040\n Now I'm starting to think\n\n39:22.040 --> 39:24.160\n maybe it doesn't have to do with a person.\n\n39:24.160 --> 39:26.720\n Maybe we're talking about something that has to do\n\n39:26.720 --> 39:28.400\n with a place that they came from\n\n39:28.400 --> 39:30.160\n or the place that they're going to.\n\n39:30.160 --> 39:33.400\n So this little thing is starting to be in my mind.\n\n39:33.400 --> 39:34.840\n Again, remember, this is not something\n\n39:34.840 --> 39:36.240\n that I woke up to overnight.\n\n39:36.240 --> 39:38.240\n I'm like, voila, I got my question.\n\n39:38.240 --> 39:39.560\n It took me for a long time.\n\n39:39.560 --> 39:42.240\n And I had to face off\n\n39:42.240 --> 39:44.880\n to have many different ideologies face each other.\n\n39:44.880 --> 39:46.360\n I had to really have a reckoning\n\n39:46.360 --> 39:48.720\n literally in my heart and in my mind.\n\n39:50.120 --> 39:53.400\n And so then that's what I'm thinking.\n\n39:53.400 --> 39:57.440\n It cannot be, no, no, no, it's the same people.\n\n39:57.440 --> 39:58.280\n It has to be about the place.\n\n39:58.280 --> 40:00.960\n It has to be about the place, but then what about this place?\n\n40:00.960 --> 40:05.200\n But then even about the place, you're thinking,\n\n40:05.200 --> 40:07.920\n again, two countries, different backgrounds, same outcome,\n\n40:07.920 --> 40:09.600\n same background, different outcome.\n\n40:10.800 --> 40:11.960\n What is this?\n\n40:11.960 --> 40:13.880\n And then I go on.\n\n40:13.880 --> 40:17.520\n I start, I am in Silicon Valley\n\n40:17.520 --> 40:21.720\n in the late 90s, early 2000s,\n\n40:21.720 --> 40:23.720\n that come boom, all of that.\n\n40:23.720 --> 40:26.600\n And I'm starting to discover this concept\n\n40:26.600 --> 40:28.680\n of this thing called entrepreneurship.\n\n40:28.680 --> 40:30.200\n You know, I'm in Silicon Valley\n\n40:30.200 --> 40:34.720\n and just getting to experience what seems so cliche by now,\n\n40:34.720 --> 40:37.000\n but you know, people getting together\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:39.600\n in the back of a napkin, talking about an idea,\n\n40:39.600 --> 40:40.960\n putting it out, and then they go out\n\n40:40.960 --> 40:43.040\n and they talk to some of these investors\n\n40:43.040 --> 40:44.080\n who's gonna invest in it.\n\n40:44.080 --> 40:45.040\n Then they have the lawyers\n\n40:45.040 --> 40:47.320\n who get to put all of this stuff together.\n\n40:47.320 --> 40:49.760\n And then they have the big four CPA firms,\n\n40:49.760 --> 40:52.960\n this whole ecosystem of what they call entrepreneurship.\n\n40:52.960 --> 40:54.920\n And then eventually this concept of entrepreneurship\n\n40:54.920 --> 40:59.320\n being this idea of creating something out of nothing.\n\n40:59.320 --> 41:00.760\n So there I am.\n\n41:00.760 --> 41:03.040\n And at some point I become an entrepreneur myself.\n\n41:03.040 --> 41:04.680\n And the way I became an entrepreneur was not like,\n\n41:04.680 --> 41:06.440\n I woke up and I'm like,\n\n41:06.440 --> 41:09.200\n I wanna make money, so I'm gonna become an entrepreneur.\n\n41:09.200 --> 41:12.080\n No, and this is also another problem I have with people\n\n41:12.080 --> 41:15.120\n who have a problem with entrepreneurs or business people.\n\n41:15.120 --> 41:19.840\n Most entrepreneurs do not start a business to become rich.\n\n41:19.840 --> 41:22.640\n Most entrepreneurs start a business\n\n41:22.640 --> 41:25.040\n because they have found, identified a problem\n\n41:25.040 --> 41:26.720\n that bothered them enough,\n\n41:26.720 --> 41:28.920\n that they said, enough is enough.\n\n41:28.920 --> 41:30.480\n I'm gonna do something about it.\n\n41:30.480 --> 41:34.600\n What entrepreneurs are are people who criticize by creating.\n\n41:34.600 --> 41:35.880\n Do they always get it right?\n\n41:35.880 --> 41:37.400\n No, as a matter of fact,\n\n41:37.400 --> 41:40.440\n the failure in entrepreneurship is humongous.\n\n41:40.440 --> 41:45.440\n It's kamikaze path to take the entrepreneurship path.\n\n41:45.520 --> 41:46.920\n We lose our spouses.\n\n41:46.920 --> 41:48.760\n My first husband passed away\n\n41:48.760 --> 41:51.960\n as soon as I was about to sign my first term sheet.\n\n41:51.960 --> 41:54.640\n And yet I had to keep going.\n\n41:54.640 --> 41:57.400\n What force can keep you going\n\n41:57.400 --> 41:59.920\n after you just lost the love of your life?\n\n41:59.920 --> 42:01.680\n What force keeps you going?\n\n42:01.680 --> 42:04.640\n The force of, oh, I just wanna be rich, really?\n\n42:04.640 --> 42:07.120\n When your whole world is upside down,\n\n42:08.560 --> 42:12.280\n your whole world is upside down and you just want to quit.\n\n42:12.280 --> 42:15.360\n You just want to go meet him and join him in death.\n\n42:16.320 --> 42:17.400\n I stayed, why?\n\n42:17.400 --> 42:20.720\n Because of the same reason why I started my company.\n\n42:20.720 --> 42:22.920\n I stayed because of the women\n\n42:22.920 --> 42:25.800\n whom I had put back to work by then.\n\n42:25.800 --> 42:27.680\n We're talking about some of the most vulnerable women\n\n42:27.680 --> 42:28.960\n in my country.\n\n42:28.960 --> 42:31.200\n These are women who grow the hibiscus,\n\n42:31.200 --> 42:33.120\n which we need to make the bisap,\n\n42:33.120 --> 42:35.240\n which is the juice of taranga, remember?\n\n42:35.240 --> 42:37.840\n This is our national identity drink.\n\n42:37.840 --> 42:40.200\n And for the longest time, women grow this hibiscus\n\n42:40.200 --> 42:43.160\n that we use for the national drink, for this drink.\n\n42:43.160 --> 42:45.400\n And now that Coca Cola, Pepsi, and all that\n\n42:45.400 --> 42:46.880\n had made it through the marketing\n\n42:46.880 --> 42:49.560\n that it is more cool to drink those beverages,\n\n42:49.560 --> 42:52.240\n now there is no more market for the hibiscus.\n\n42:52.240 --> 42:54.760\n And with that goes the livelihoods of these women.\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.480\n And for me, that bothered me enough\n\n42:58.480 --> 43:00.760\n because in that force, I saw two things.\n\n43:00.760 --> 43:03.680\n One was a part of my culture.\n\n43:03.680 --> 43:06.080\n We're talking about, I mean,\n\n43:06.080 --> 43:10.120\n part of my cultural identity, for Christ's sake,\n\n43:10.120 --> 43:11.280\n the juice of taranga.\n\n43:11.280 --> 43:12.560\n You asked me, what defines you?\n\n43:12.560 --> 43:14.880\n I said, taranga, there's a juice for it.\n\n43:14.880 --> 43:16.760\n So my culture is disappearing.\n\n43:16.760 --> 43:19.600\n And at the same time, these women\n\n43:20.680 --> 43:22.880\n are sliding into abject poverty\n\n43:22.880 --> 43:25.880\n because what they used to make no one needs anymore.\n\n43:25.880 --> 43:30.880\n So that is what got me to start a company.\n\n43:31.040 --> 43:34.000\n And the company was created just because of that.\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:38.640\n I wanted to build a company that would allow me\n\n43:38.640 --> 43:42.600\n to not only preserve this very important aspect\n\n43:42.600 --> 43:44.160\n of my cultural identity,\n\n43:44.160 --> 43:48.440\n and at the same time, put these women back to work.\n\n43:48.440 --> 43:51.440\n And maybe it's more difficult to put into words,\n\n43:51.440 --> 43:55.840\n but there's a kind of, it's a basic human spirit\n\n43:55.840 --> 43:58.880\n where you see the place where you came from\n\n44:00.480 --> 44:03.120\n breaking apart in some kind of way,\n\n44:03.120 --> 44:06.480\n and you have the entrepreneurial fire\n\n44:06.480 --> 44:08.640\n that dreams of helping.\n\n44:08.640 --> 44:09.480\n Yes.\n\n44:09.480 --> 44:13.480\n And that, sometimes it's hard to convert that into words.\n\n44:13.480 --> 44:15.120\n You have to tell nice stories and so on,\n\n44:15.120 --> 44:17.360\n but it's the basic human desire to help.\n\n44:17.360 --> 44:18.200\n Yes.\n\n44:18.200 --> 44:21.320\n And like I said, criticized by creating.\n\n44:21.320 --> 44:22.920\n Especially when you've been,\n\n44:22.920 --> 44:25.200\n especially when, and let's face it,\n\n44:26.560 --> 44:29.760\n do we all, are we all a bundle of circumstances,\n\n44:29.760 --> 44:31.480\n some happy, some worse?\n\n44:31.480 --> 44:32.640\n Yes, we are.\n\n44:32.640 --> 44:37.120\n And oftentimes I ask myself, my God, why you?\n\n44:37.120 --> 44:42.120\n Why did you get to have the opportunities that you have?\n\n44:42.120 --> 44:44.200\n What makes you different from, let's say,\n\n44:44.200 --> 44:49.200\n even your cousin that couldn't, that is still home, trapped?\n\n44:49.200 --> 44:51.640\n Because we call ourselves trapped citizens.\n\n44:51.640 --> 44:54.520\n When you're trapped in these countries that go nowhere,\n\n44:54.520 --> 44:57.240\n we're like a bunch of trapped citizens.\n\n44:57.240 --> 45:02.240\n So you see, Lex, when my husband passed away\n\n45:02.440 --> 45:04.840\n and I wanted nothing more to do than to quit\n\n45:04.840 --> 45:07.440\n and to send, investors had already said,\n\n45:07.440 --> 45:09.200\n we understand if you want to stop.\n\n45:09.200 --> 45:11.440\n Whatever you decide to do, we'll do that.\n\n45:11.440 --> 45:15.360\n And I wanted to quit and I was actually on my way.\n\n45:15.360 --> 45:17.920\n I was in Senegal for a month,\n\n45:17.920 --> 45:20.520\n trying to really get a bearing over myself.\n\n45:20.520 --> 45:25.520\n And by the end of the month, I had decided I'm letting go.\n\n45:25.720 --> 45:26.560\n There's no way.\n\n45:26.560 --> 45:30.200\n The pain was too great, nothing made sense anymore.\n\n45:30.200 --> 45:31.760\n It was too much.\n\n45:31.760 --> 45:36.760\n So I went to see this woman and I talked to the one who,\n\n45:36.920 --> 45:39.160\n you know, we're talking back then,\n\n45:39.160 --> 45:43.520\n there were 400 of them, later on we grew to 9,000.\n\n45:43.520 --> 45:47.800\n And I told the representative of all of them,\n\n45:47.800 --> 45:51.160\n and I told her, this is very, this is her old lady.\n\n45:51.160 --> 45:53.320\n And just looking at her,\n\n45:53.320 --> 45:54.920\n I knew I was going through some pain,\n\n45:54.920 --> 45:57.600\n but this woman has probably gone through 10 times,\n\n45:57.600 --> 46:00.320\n not that pain is, you know, like measurable,\n\n46:00.320 --> 46:02.880\n but you could tell this woman probably lost a child\n\n46:02.880 --> 46:05.240\n as oftentimes happen in places, you know,\n\n46:05.240 --> 46:07.880\n that are lower income countries.\n\n46:07.880 --> 46:11.600\n Probably lost a husband also, probably who knows,\n\n46:11.600 --> 46:13.560\n so many people, loss is part of our lives.\n\n46:13.560 --> 46:14.400\n You can see the pain.\n\n46:14.400 --> 46:18.080\n You can see the pain, yet she's so, so dignified.\n\n46:18.080 --> 46:19.840\n She's so dignified.\n\n46:19.840 --> 46:22.120\n And that already kind of made me like,\n\n46:22.120 --> 46:23.520\n my God, stop crying.\n\n46:23.520 --> 46:27.040\n But, and I told her that I was quitting.\n\n46:28.080 --> 46:29.560\n I could not look her in the eyes.\n\n46:29.560 --> 46:33.720\n And she said, look at me.\n\n46:33.720 --> 46:34.880\n I could not look her in the eyes.\n\n46:34.880 --> 46:36.280\n She said, look at me, child.\n\n46:36.280 --> 46:40.520\n And I looked at her and she said,\n\n46:41.560 --> 46:44.840\n you know, I know you're in pain,\n\n46:44.840 --> 46:48.240\n but where your husband is, where your beloved is,\n\n46:48.240 --> 46:51.200\n is absolutely nothing that you can do for him.\n\n46:51.200 --> 46:54.080\n But for us, you can change everything.\n\n46:54.080 --> 46:55.800\n And I went back.\n\n46:55.800 --> 47:00.800\n So that's what entrepreneurs are at their best.\n\n47:01.320 --> 47:03.200\n Did she help you find your strength?\n\n47:03.200 --> 47:08.200\n Yes, and I was weak still,\n\n47:08.280 --> 47:11.040\n but I said, you put that aside.\n\n47:11.040 --> 47:12.320\n There's a job to do here.\n\n47:13.240 --> 47:16.920\n And I went back and I fought with everything that I had.\n\n47:16.920 --> 47:19.120\n And this company that I started in my kitchen\n\n47:20.480 --> 47:22.520\n became this company that had the who's who\n\n47:22.520 --> 47:23.720\n of the beverage world,\n\n47:24.800 --> 47:27.680\n with at some point, Roger Enrico, the chairman of PepsiCo\n\n47:27.680 --> 47:30.360\n sitting on my board.\n\n47:30.360 --> 47:34.400\n And yeah, I went back because of that.\n\n47:34.400 --> 47:37.680\n So the reason why I tell this story for me is important\n\n47:37.680 --> 47:40.360\n because the world needs to understand\n\n47:43.120 --> 47:48.120\n that there is a viable way of caring\n\n47:50.040 --> 47:53.640\n and of being part of a solution\n\n47:54.560 --> 47:57.320\n for the lesser fortunate\n\n47:57.320 --> 48:00.480\n in terms of not keeping them where they are\n\n48:00.480 --> 48:02.240\n and we're like the saviors coming\n\n48:02.240 --> 48:03.880\n and giving them food and all that.\n\n48:03.880 --> 48:05.000\n No, no, no, no, no.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.760\n But it's just like the leg up I got in my life.\n\n48:07.760 --> 48:09.160\n Give somebody else a leg up.\n\n48:10.640 --> 48:14.000\n What are the things you're fighting against in Africa\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:17.360\n when you try to build a business like that?\n\n48:17.360 --> 48:19.200\n So then we're building this company.\n\n48:20.200 --> 48:24.760\n And back then, this was in 2004\n\n48:24.760 --> 48:28.720\n that was when I built my first company.\n\n48:28.720 --> 48:32.280\n We had to have two sister companies, one there, one here.\n\n48:32.280 --> 48:35.840\n So the one in Africa was about the whole supply chain.\n\n48:36.920 --> 48:41.920\n And the one in America was research and development,\n\n48:42.320 --> 48:44.520\n sales and marketing, all of that good stuff.\n\n48:45.680 --> 48:48.440\n And then at some point I look around,\n\n48:48.440 --> 48:50.120\n I'm like, wait a second.\n\n48:50.120 --> 48:52.680\n Here, back in the days before we had the,\n\n48:52.680 --> 48:55.080\n they would talk, they would say, oh, we have this one stop shop\n\n48:55.080 --> 48:56.440\n for business registration.\n\n48:56.440 --> 49:00.120\n But the truth is very quickly\n\n49:00.120 --> 49:01.760\n you can set up an LLC in the US.\n\n49:01.760 --> 49:05.000\n We're talking about less than, even then less than,\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:07.840\n today it's super fast, 20 minutes online, done.\n\n49:07.840 --> 49:12.760\n Back then it was less than few hours to get it done,\n\n49:13.600 --> 49:14.680\n cost you almost nothing.\n\n49:14.680 --> 49:16.560\n We're talking about a few hundred dollars,\n\n49:16.560 --> 49:19.360\n three, two to 350 depending which state you are.\n\n49:19.360 --> 49:23.800\n So LLC, starting a basic company takes almost no time.\n\n49:23.800 --> 49:25.680\n No time, no time, no money, almost.\n\n49:25.680 --> 49:29.120\n You don't have to know a guy that knows a guy\n\n49:29.120 --> 49:33.240\n that slipped some money to the politician and so on.\n\n49:33.240 --> 49:35.560\n No, none of that stuff, none of that stuff.\n\n49:35.560 --> 49:39.960\n And so at the same time, also things like,\n\n49:39.960 --> 49:42.600\n and this I can take you even to today's day.\n\n49:42.600 --> 49:44.760\n Okay, Lex, I don't know if you have employees\n\n49:44.760 --> 49:46.600\n on payroll or anything like that,\n\n49:46.600 --> 49:50.560\n but do you have to go every month\n\n49:50.560 --> 49:52.760\n or anybody listening to us right now,\n\n49:52.760 --> 49:56.840\n do they have to go every single month\n\n49:56.840 --> 49:59.000\n to three different type of agencies,\n\n50:02.040 --> 50:07.040\n like governmental agencies to do one step?\n\n50:07.440 --> 50:10.160\n This one is basically you're gonna go\n\n50:10.160 --> 50:14.000\n and give them your retirement money,\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.240\n like the pension part of the salary\n\n50:16.240 --> 50:18.400\n that you took out from your employee.\n\n50:18.400 --> 50:20.080\n You have to go to this agency\n\n50:20.080 --> 50:22.040\n and put that application through.\n\n50:22.040 --> 50:23.840\n So you leave that money behind,\n\n50:23.840 --> 50:25.360\n then you go to another agency.\n\n50:25.360 --> 50:28.360\n This one is for the health, care, whatever.\n\n50:28.360 --> 50:30.000\n You have three of those places\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:33.560\n where you have to literally go to in person,\n\n50:33.560 --> 50:36.800\n three times, three places every single month\n\n50:37.680 --> 50:40.080\n to drop off these paperwork.\n\n50:41.320 --> 50:42.600\n Do you have to do that anywhere in the US?\n\n50:42.600 --> 50:45.080\n I mean, do we have that situation\n\n50:45.080 --> 50:47.120\n anywhere that you know of right now?\n\n50:47.120 --> 50:48.200\n No, no.\n\n50:48.200 --> 50:50.120\n And do you think that's a business friendly\n\n50:50.120 --> 50:52.160\n or do you think it's cumbersome in business?\n\n50:52.160 --> 50:55.160\n And that's not just cumbersome sort of physically,\n\n50:55.160 --> 50:57.320\n it's cumbersome psychologically,\n\n50:57.320 --> 51:01.880\n that there's a feeling like the system around you,\n\n51:01.880 --> 51:03.760\n yeah, there's a feeling like you're trapped.\n\n51:03.760 --> 51:07.200\n It's a feeling like the system doesn't want you to succeed\n\n51:07.200 --> 51:09.520\n versus a system that does want you to succeed.\n\n51:09.520 --> 51:10.840\n Exactly.\n\n51:10.840 --> 51:13.880\n You're in a country like we're in Texas.\n\n51:13.880 --> 51:18.040\n If you make less than a million bucks in revenues a year,\n\n51:18.040 --> 51:19.800\n all you do, five minutes it takes you,\n\n51:19.800 --> 51:24.800\n you're filing your franchise tax, that's it.\n\n51:27.080 --> 51:29.280\n It's below that number, tell them what it is,\n\n51:29.280 --> 51:30.720\n then you have nothing to give them\n\n51:30.720 --> 51:33.160\n or anything like that, you move on.\n\n51:33.160 --> 51:36.880\n Us, even if I make this much,\n\n51:38.040 --> 51:40.120\n there is a minimum tax that you have to pay,\n\n51:40.120 --> 51:42.560\n which is $1,000 in Senegal right now.\n\n51:42.560 --> 51:46.480\n For the listener, my guy was holding up a zero.\n\n51:47.560 --> 51:49.040\n You make no money.\n\n51:49.040 --> 51:49.880\n You still have to pay.\n\n51:49.880 --> 51:52.720\n You still have to pay.\n\n51:52.720 --> 51:55.560\n And then, oh, let me walk you through what happened to me\n\n51:55.560 --> 51:59.120\n when we had to try to get the electricity hooked up\n\n51:59.120 --> 52:00.800\n on our first office.\n\n52:00.800 --> 52:03.320\n So we go, they say, oh, first you have to apply,\n\n52:03.320 --> 52:05.800\n you know, like you normally you have to apply.\n\n52:05.800 --> 52:08.280\n Then we apply, we pay the money.\n\n52:08.280 --> 52:10.040\n Remember again, here you have to also go,\n\n52:10.040 --> 52:13.320\n this was like, you know, you go to the office and you pay.\n\n52:13.320 --> 52:16.520\n And then we wait, and we wait, and we wait.\n\n52:16.520 --> 52:17.840\n And when I say we wait, I'm not talking about\n\n52:17.840 --> 52:20.400\n we waited 24 hours, we waited 48 hours.\n\n52:20.400 --> 52:24.200\n A month, two months, three months, four months,\n\n52:24.200 --> 52:26.960\n five months, you go, you send your assistant,\n\n52:26.960 --> 52:28.760\n she goes, she comes back.\n\n52:28.760 --> 52:30.160\n Well, they say we send it to wait.\n\n52:30.160 --> 52:31.800\n At some point I'm like, I gotta go there.\n\n52:31.800 --> 52:34.520\n So I go there and I asked to speak\n\n52:34.520 --> 52:38.240\n to the head of the district for, you know,\n\n52:38.240 --> 52:41.920\n and I'm just like going on and on and on and on\n\n52:41.920 --> 52:43.240\n about how we've been delayed.\n\n52:43.240 --> 52:44.280\n This is gonna be a problem.\n\n52:44.280 --> 52:46.560\n We have to produce, everything is delayed.\n\n52:46.560 --> 52:49.080\n And I risk losing my business.\n\n52:49.080 --> 52:53.000\n We already presold some of these products to our customers.\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:54.800\n I gotta, something needs to happen.\n\n52:55.880 --> 52:58.000\n So at some point the gentleman looks at me,\n\n52:58.000 --> 52:59.520\n he's like, lady, look over there.\n\n52:59.520 --> 53:03.880\n I look over there, I see a pile of paper this high.\n\n53:03.880 --> 53:07.240\n We're talking about maybe hundreds of applications.\n\n53:07.240 --> 53:10.240\n Each one of them is a single sheet.\n\n53:10.240 --> 53:12.280\n Each single sheet is an application\n\n53:12.280 --> 53:14.760\n for getting the electricity.\n\n53:15.600 --> 53:16.920\n And he says, do you see that?\n\n53:16.920 --> 53:17.760\n I said, yeah.\n\n53:17.760 --> 53:18.720\n And he said, look over there.\n\n53:18.720 --> 53:20.680\n I look over there to the other side.\n\n53:20.680 --> 53:22.400\n I see two meters.\n\n53:22.400 --> 53:26.280\n He's like, each of these applications needs one of those.\n\n53:26.280 --> 53:27.120\n How many do you see?\n\n53:27.120 --> 53:28.160\n I said, two.\n\n53:28.160 --> 53:29.600\n Then I knew I was in trouble.\n\n53:31.320 --> 53:33.680\n And then I said, what do I do?\n\n53:33.680 --> 53:37.480\n And he said, lady, it's not at our level.\n\n53:37.480 --> 53:38.480\n And I agreed with him.\n\n53:38.480 --> 53:40.040\n It was not on his level.\n\n53:40.040 --> 53:41.880\n But eventually, by now you can tell\n\n53:41.880 --> 53:44.120\n that I pretty much get what I need because,\n\n53:44.120 --> 53:46.000\n and at that point what I did was not threaten him\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:46.840\n or anything like that.\n\n53:46.840 --> 53:47.840\n I didn't even pay a bribe or anything,\n\n53:47.840 --> 53:50.160\n but you could see why people pay bribes.\n\n53:50.160 --> 53:52.080\n Because when you have a pile like that,\n\n53:52.080 --> 53:53.960\n then the only way to advance your file,\n\n53:53.960 --> 53:56.920\n and that by the way happens even at the passport office.\n\n53:56.920 --> 54:00.720\n You come, you apply for your passport, which is your right.\n\n54:00.720 --> 54:02.000\n They forced us to have passports.\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:03.880\n It's your right as a citizen to have a passport.\n\n54:03.880 --> 54:06.280\n And even there, if you want yours\n\n54:06.280 --> 54:07.480\n to keep going through the process,\n\n54:07.480 --> 54:09.120\n you have to bribe somebody so it can go\n\n54:09.120 --> 54:11.880\n even the pace it's supposed to go, let alone faster.\n\n54:11.880 --> 54:15.160\n So here, I'm thinking I have a problem.\n\n54:15.160 --> 54:17.360\n And at that point, I did what I do.\n\n54:17.360 --> 54:19.760\n I talked to him about all the things I was trying to do.\n\n54:19.760 --> 54:22.960\n I explained to him why I'm here, why I'm trying to do this.\n\n54:22.960 --> 54:25.320\n And even him said, lady, someone like you,\n\n54:25.320 --> 54:28.360\n you have no reason to even be here.\n\n54:28.360 --> 54:30.960\n You could be back in America, living your life,\n\n54:30.960 --> 54:32.640\n la vida loca, you don't have to be here.\n\n54:32.640 --> 54:35.240\n So that I think gained a lot of his respect.\n\n54:35.240 --> 54:38.320\n And I said, if you don't do, if you don't help me with this,\n\n54:38.320 --> 54:40.920\n I understand I shouldn't be of a priority\n\n54:40.920 --> 54:43.600\n or anything like that, but I beg you, I beg of you.\n\n54:43.600 --> 54:46.440\n I need for this to go on this week.\n\n54:46.440 --> 54:48.680\n And he said, okay, that's how I got my meter.\n\n54:48.680 --> 54:50.640\n One of those two meters became mine.\n\n54:50.640 --> 54:52.520\n So then he said, but we have a problem.\n\n54:52.520 --> 54:53.920\n And I said, what?\n\n54:53.920 --> 54:57.720\n He said, well, the truck, we need a truck to be here\n\n54:57.720 --> 55:00.880\n to do it because of where you are from the poll,\n\n55:00.880 --> 55:05.360\n we need long cable lines to get it all done.\n\n55:05.360 --> 55:06.760\n But the truck is, I don't know,\n\n55:06.760 --> 55:07.800\n I don't know where the truck was\n\n55:07.800 --> 55:08.680\n because they had this one truck\n\n55:08.680 --> 55:10.640\n for I don't know how many customers.\n\n55:10.640 --> 55:11.920\n So I go to the mayor of a town\n\n55:11.920 --> 55:15.920\n with whom I'm quite friends, but you see, I know people,\n\n55:15.920 --> 55:17.360\n but it shouldn't be this way.\n\n55:17.360 --> 55:21.240\n So I go to the mayor of a town and I said, mayor,\n\n55:21.240 --> 55:22.760\n he happens to have the same name as me,\n\n55:22.760 --> 55:25.520\n first, last name, same, but except he's the ugly one,\n\n55:25.520 --> 55:28.600\n I'm the pretty one because, you know, he's, you know.\n\n55:28.600 --> 55:32.400\n That's so people can tell you apart, she's the pretty one.\n\n55:32.400 --> 55:34.920\n Exactly, I'm the pretty one and he's the whatever.\n\n55:34.920 --> 55:37.360\n So I got to the mayor and I'm like, mayor,\n\n55:37.360 --> 55:38.960\n I need your help, you need to help me with this.\n\n55:38.960 --> 55:40.320\n He's like, now what?\n\n55:40.320 --> 55:42.120\n And I explained to him and he's like, okay,\n\n55:42.120 --> 55:45.280\n you can take the truck from the city hall.\n\n55:45.280 --> 55:47.640\n I'll tell the guys that they can allow you to have it.\n\n55:47.640 --> 55:50.200\n And then they come and then you guys can do this.\n\n55:50.200 --> 55:51.560\n And then we arrived there.\n\n55:51.560 --> 55:52.400\n Guess what?\n\n55:52.400 --> 55:54.720\n I thought I was done, Lex, but I was not done.\n\n55:54.720 --> 55:56.680\n Because now the electricity company, by the way,\n\n55:56.680 --> 55:59.000\n whom we paid, everything was there.\n\n55:59.000 --> 56:02.360\n They've been sitting on our money for nine months by now.\n\n56:02.360 --> 56:06.440\n Well, we need a ladder long enough to, you know,\n\n56:06.440 --> 56:08.160\n like one of the super, super professional ladders\n\n56:08.160 --> 56:10.960\n that normally the electricity companies have.\n\n56:10.960 --> 56:15.040\n Theirs was in some other village and they didn't know\n\n56:15.040 --> 56:16.720\n if it was going to be back for another three days\n\n56:16.720 --> 56:17.560\n or four days.\n\n56:18.640 --> 56:20.520\n I said, are you kidding me?\n\n56:20.520 --> 56:21.760\n He's like, no.\n\n56:21.760 --> 56:23.080\n So I call mayor again.\n\n56:23.080 --> 56:25.240\n I'm just like, mayor, do you have a ladder?\n\n56:25.240 --> 56:26.680\n And I explained and he said,\n\n56:26.680 --> 56:30.640\n and that's how I got my electricity hooked up.\n\n56:30.640 --> 56:33.240\n Otherwise I probably would still be waiting.\n\n56:33.240 --> 56:36.240\n So Lex, you add all of these things together.\n\n56:36.240 --> 56:38.360\n And also the fact that in my country, by the way,\n\n56:38.360 --> 56:41.200\n the labor laws are so stringent.\n\n56:41.200 --> 56:44.240\n Basically you are married to employees for good or for bad.\n\n56:44.240 --> 56:45.960\n And some people say, oh no,\n\n56:45.960 --> 56:47.560\n you're not married for good or for bad,\n\n56:47.560 --> 56:50.520\n except that it will just cost you a lot of time and money\n\n56:50.520 --> 56:52.520\n to get rid of any of them.\n\n56:52.520 --> 56:54.080\n It doesn't matter the circumstances.\n\n56:54.080 --> 56:56.080\n Do you think I really, an entrepreneur really need\n\n56:56.080 --> 56:57.520\n to hear something like that?\n\n56:57.520 --> 56:58.760\n You know, the head of the ILO,\n\n56:58.760 --> 57:01.240\n I had an argument with him at the UN.\n\n57:01.240 --> 57:04.680\n And I said to him, listen, and you listened to me very well.\n\n57:04.680 --> 57:09.680\n The reason, if you want to protect employees,\n\n57:10.320 --> 57:13.800\n as you claim, everything you're doing is to protect employees.\n\n57:13.800 --> 57:17.240\n A, you know better of a human being than I am\n\n57:17.240 --> 57:18.720\n in terms of wanting to make sure\n\n57:18.720 --> 57:21.160\n that people are treated right and fairly.\n\n57:21.160 --> 57:24.880\n But last time I checked, Google, for example,\n\n57:24.880 --> 57:28.320\n is not offering their employees chef cooked meals,\n\n57:28.320 --> 57:31.440\n super healthy, anything they want,\n\n57:31.440 --> 57:34.200\n feeding them from morning till evening,\n\n57:34.200 --> 57:39.200\n having some babysitters, having childcare on site,\n\n57:39.440 --> 57:44.360\n all of these perks that come on top of really cozy salaries.\n\n57:44.360 --> 57:46.600\n It did not happen because you, the ILO, told them,\n\n57:46.600 --> 57:47.920\n you have to do this.\n\n57:47.920 --> 57:51.640\n It happened because there are enough jobs created around\n\n57:51.640 --> 57:54.960\n that now you're in an employee's market\n\n57:54.960 --> 57:57.760\n and employers have to fall all over themselves\n\n57:57.760 --> 58:00.680\n to attract the best talent among us.\n\n58:00.680 --> 58:01.800\n That's how it's done.\n\n58:01.800 --> 58:05.320\n And not with your nonsense that you're imposing me right now,\n\n58:05.320 --> 58:07.240\n which the only results you're gonna get,\n\n58:07.240 --> 58:09.640\n like in my country, do you know what we have to show\n\n58:09.640 --> 58:12.440\n for all of these, the fact that the Senegalese employees,\n\n58:12.440 --> 58:15.560\n the most protected employee on paper in the world?\n\n58:15.560 --> 58:19.200\n Well, we're one of the 25 poorest countries in the world.\n\n58:19.200 --> 58:20.560\n That's what it got us.\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:26.520\n So let's try to just untangle this.\n\n58:26.520 --> 58:28.360\n So there's a system in place.\n\n58:28.360 --> 58:30.720\n There's a momentum with that system.\n\n58:30.720 --> 58:33.560\n Like you said, ladies, it's not my level,\n\n58:33.560 --> 58:37.040\n which is for somebody who grew up in the Soviet Union,\n\n58:38.240 --> 58:42.120\n at least echoes some of the same sounds I heard\n\n58:42.120 --> 58:45.720\n from people I knew there.\n\n58:45.720 --> 58:48.040\n It's kind of this helpless feeling like,\n\n58:48.040 --> 58:50.200\n well, this is just part of the system,\n\n58:50.200 --> 58:52.520\n this gigantic bureaucracy.\n\n58:52.520 --> 58:56.720\n And the corruption that happens is just like the only way\n\n58:56.720 --> 58:58.920\n to get around, to get anything done.\n\n58:58.920 --> 59:01.240\n And so the corruption grows.\n\n59:01.240 --> 59:03.160\n Maybe could you speak to the corruption?\n\n59:03.160 --> 59:06.920\n Is there, to what degree is there corruption\n\n59:06.920 --> 59:11.920\n in Senegal and Africa, and how do we fix it?\n\n59:13.040 --> 59:16.000\n So when you said to which degrees there is corruption,\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:18.240\n I will respond to you the same I respond to people.\n\n59:18.240 --> 59:19.880\n I say, yeah, we have corruption,\n\n59:19.880 --> 59:23.320\n and it's almost as bad as in Chicago, right?\n\n59:23.320 --> 59:27.000\n So now what I want people to understand\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:28.800\n when it comes to corruption,\n\n59:28.800 --> 59:33.200\n it's because we are misguided with corruption.\n\n59:33.200 --> 59:35.640\n We think corruption is the root cause of problems.\n\n59:35.640 --> 59:38.400\n When corruption is simply a symptom\n\n59:38.400 --> 59:41.040\n of the deeper root problem.\n\n59:42.200 --> 59:47.200\n In this case, if you make the laws so senseless,\n\n59:52.200 --> 59:55.960\n meaning, let me give you an example of senseless laws.\n\n59:55.960 --> 59:59.080\n Every time I have to import something in my country,\n\n59:59.080 --> 1:00:02.280\n I have a business, we're making lip balms in this case\n\n1:00:02.280 --> 1:00:06.440\n and all those skincare products.\n\n1:00:06.440 --> 1:00:09.080\n Some ingredients I'm able to find in the country\n\n1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:13.440\n at the standard that I need in order to remain competitive.\n\n1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:14.920\n Because for example, our products are sold\n\n1:00:14.920 --> 1:00:16.040\n at Whole Foods Market.\n\n1:00:16.040 --> 1:00:18.440\n You can understand it's a pretty sophisticated\n\n1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:22.520\n and really, they don't just put anybody on the shelves.\n\n1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:25.960\n But the thing is, it means that on the other end,\n\n1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:28.960\n my inputs has to be right.\n\n1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:32.920\n So out of those, some, we have seven ingredients,\n\n1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:35.320\n seven items that need to come from abroad\n\n1:00:36.440 --> 1:00:38.560\n to go into the making of this product.\n\n1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:40.960\n Some packaging and some raw material.\n\n1:00:42.200 --> 1:00:45.960\n But guess what, Lex, for five of them,\n\n1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:48.760\n I am paying a 40% tariff\n\n1:00:48.760 --> 1:00:51.440\n and for the other two, almost 70% tariff.\n\n1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:54.800\n That I call senseless laws.\n\n1:00:54.800 --> 1:00:57.920\n These tariffs are senseless.\n\n1:00:57.920 --> 1:00:59.960\n Yeah, corruption is just a symptom.\n\n1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:02.960\n They reveal that something was broken about the laws.\n\n1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:05.960\n And the laws are, so taxation,\n\n1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:10.720\n this kind of restricting laws,\n\n1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:14.520\n like laws that slow down the entrepreneurial momentum.\n\n1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:15.960\n They do, they do.\n\n1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:19.240\n Because in this case, when my product comes,\n\n1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:21.600\n what do people have to do?\n\n1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:25.400\n Because every time, if you add 40%,\n\n1:01:25.400 --> 1:01:26.680\n you're basically on the other end.\n\n1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:28.400\n So every time you add,\n\n1:01:28.400 --> 1:01:31.640\n if let's say my product normally costs a dollar\n\n1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:33.880\n and with your 40%, by the time I'm done,\n\n1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:36.640\n I had to pay, now it's costing me 140.\n\n1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:39.000\n By the time it arrives in my warehouse,\n\n1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.520\n in my manufacturing facility, it's now at 140\n\n1:01:42.520 --> 1:01:44.800\n because of a tariff I left behind.\n\n1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:47.200\n That 40% you added to it,\n\n1:01:47.200 --> 1:01:49.960\n do you know how much it's gonna add to my final cost\n\n1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:51.160\n that once the product is finished,\n\n1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:53.160\n I have to sell it to the customer?\n\n1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:57.240\n I have to sell it for $1.60 more because of that 40 cents\n\n1:01:57.240 --> 1:01:58.920\n extra you took from me.\n\n1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:00.880\n In order for me at the end of the day\n\n1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:02.520\n to have some type of profits,\n\n1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:05.920\n because profits at the end of the day\n\n1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:08.280\n is the blood of a business.\n\n1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:09.960\n There are two people are misguided.\n\n1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:13.800\n They say, oh, you dirty, greedy business people.\n\n1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:16.320\n And it's all about profit, profit, profit, profit.\n\n1:02:17.840 --> 1:02:20.560\n You know, I belong to this organization called,\n\n1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:23.080\n I'm a board member on the conscious capitalism.\n\n1:02:23.080 --> 1:02:27.760\n It is the largest organization of purpose driven\n\n1:02:27.760 --> 1:02:29.760\n businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\n1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:31.080\n The type of people I told you about,\n\n1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:34.160\n we've started our businesses because we see something\n\n1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:36.640\n that needs to be taken care of in society.\n\n1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:38.600\n Whole Foods Market is one of them.\n\n1:02:38.600 --> 1:02:40.600\n The Container Store, you know,\n\n1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:43.080\n all of these companies that are beloved in the US\n\n1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:44.800\n that you can hear of.\n\n1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:49.800\n We believe that the end goal of business is purpose.\n\n1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:52.120\n But in order to do purpose,\n\n1:02:52.120 --> 1:02:57.120\n you have to have profits to stay alive.\n\n1:02:57.280 --> 1:02:59.840\n And the best way for people to think of profits\n\n1:02:59.840 --> 1:03:02.560\n so that they're not all twisted about it.\n\n1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:07.040\n Lex, if I asked you, what's your goal in the world?\n\n1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:09.520\n You're probably gonna tell me your dream.\n\n1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:11.880\n You're gonna talk to me about what you're doing right now\n\n1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:13.840\n and how you want to be uniting,\n\n1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:15.240\n or you want a more harmonious world.\n\n1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:16.920\n You want human flourishing.\n\n1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:18.720\n That's what you're working towards.\n\n1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:20.080\n That's what you say to me.\n\n1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:23.040\n You're not gonna say, well, my biggest goal in the world\n\n1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:25.720\n is to produce as many red blood cells as I can.\n\n1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:28.840\n Except you need to produce those, otherwise no Lex.\n\n1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:31.960\n And if no Lex, no one working.\n\n1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:32.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:33.640\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:34.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:35.800\n So that's how people need to stop\n\n1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:37.800\n with this whole profit, non profit.\n\n1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:40.400\n Do we have some psychopaths among us?\n\n1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:42.720\n Yeah, one person of us in this world are psychopaths\n\n1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:45.200\n in every field, anywhere you look.\n\n1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:48.480\n And surely you'll find that in the entrepreneurial field.\n\n1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:50.080\n Entrepreneurs world as well.\n\n1:03:50.080 --> 1:03:50.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:53.800\n So we have one person of us who are psychopath for sure.\n\n1:03:53.800 --> 1:03:55.240\n But do they define the rest of us?\n\n1:03:55.240 --> 1:03:56.080\n Absolutely not.\n\n1:03:56.080 --> 1:03:57.320\n And thankfully not.\n\n1:03:57.320 --> 1:03:59.920\n So let's just be clear on that.\n\n1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:04.120\n So here, you know, you charge me 40% tariff,\n\n1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:05.880\n which is outrageous.\n\n1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:09.080\n Then you're forcing me to sell it for $1.60 more\n\n1:04:09.080 --> 1:04:10.800\n than my competitor who does not have to go\n\n1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:12.920\n through that nonsense because she's an American woman\n\n1:04:12.920 --> 1:04:14.080\n who is operating in America.\n\n1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:16.200\n And she doesn't have that nonsense put on her.\n\n1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:18.720\n So now I'm on this market competing against this woman\n\n1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:20.320\n eye to eye.\n\n1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:23.640\n So if we're selling the same value product,\n\n1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:27.000\n mine costs $1.60 more simply because of some stupid rules\n\n1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.680\n from back home, then guess who is going to stay in business\n\n1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:30.520\n and who doesn't?\n\n1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:33.680\n See, they want to talk about equality.\n\n1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:35.680\n That's the type of equality I want to see.\n\n1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:39.120\n The playing field has to be leveled.\n\n1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:41.240\n Told you English is my fourth language.\n\n1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:44.520\n It was two people talking between us.\n\n1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:46.480\n Maybe we'll have this English thing figured out.\n\n1:04:46.480 --> 1:04:48.360\n We'll have it figured out.\n\n1:04:48.360 --> 1:04:50.680\n So the idea of capitalism,\n\n1:04:50.680 --> 1:04:53.520\n the idea of conscious capitalism is the thing\n\n1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:57.840\n that in large part enables this level playing field.\n\n1:04:57.840 --> 1:04:58.920\n That's what we want.\n\n1:04:58.920 --> 1:05:01.080\n So what you're trying to say, so here,\n\n1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:03.240\n so when I talked about census laws, that's an example.\n\n1:05:03.240 --> 1:05:05.960\n So when you make the tariff so high\n\n1:05:05.960 --> 1:05:10.960\n that you're going to render me, you know, noncompetitive,\n\n1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:14.360\n then that's where, for people who might make sense,\n\n1:05:14.360 --> 1:05:17.760\n when the product arrives at port, they say,\n\n1:05:17.760 --> 1:05:20.400\n hey, I give you this.\n\n1:05:20.400 --> 1:05:23.600\n What I give you, maybe it's 10% of the price or 5%.\n\n1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:27.280\n It's surely not 40%, but you are happy with it.\n\n1:05:27.280 --> 1:05:28.800\n You're the government official.\n\n1:05:28.800 --> 1:05:30.440\n That's what we call a bribe.\n\n1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:33.240\n And me, I'm like, hey, I saved myself money.\n\n1:05:33.240 --> 1:05:35.720\n And also I saved myself time.\n\n1:05:36.920 --> 1:05:40.040\n But you see, if the laws where you pay 5%\n\n1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:43.320\n or even the 10% that I just left behind or nothing,\n\n1:05:43.320 --> 1:05:45.080\n you come, you pay it, you move on.\n\n1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:46.880\n Because who has a business of fooling around\n\n1:05:46.880 --> 1:05:47.720\n and staying behind?\n\n1:05:47.720 --> 1:05:51.240\n And no, you do that when it's actually makes sense to do that.\n\n1:05:51.240 --> 1:05:52.920\n So I'm not sitting here telling people\n\n1:05:52.920 --> 1:05:55.880\n I engage in unlawful practices in my case,\n\n1:05:55.880 --> 1:05:58.480\n because I'm around saying the things I'm saying right now.\n\n1:05:58.480 --> 1:06:00.280\n So I'm a target.\n\n1:06:00.280 --> 1:06:01.520\n You have to do things cleanly.\n\n1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:03.120\n And I believe in doing things that way.\n\n1:06:03.120 --> 1:06:07.480\n So what I had to do was go to the ask again mayor.\n\n1:06:07.480 --> 1:06:08.640\n We have a problem.\n\n1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:10.840\n Mayors, whenever he sees me, he's like, now what?\n\n1:06:10.840 --> 1:06:13.760\n So I'm like, we've got a problem.\n\n1:06:13.760 --> 1:06:15.960\n You're best friends now.\n\n1:06:15.960 --> 1:06:18.440\n So I say, now it's the customs.\n\n1:06:18.440 --> 1:06:20.480\n And he's like, what do you want me to do?\n\n1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:21.880\n I said, do you know anybody at customs?\n\n1:06:21.880 --> 1:06:23.080\n I need to hire up at customs,\n\n1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:25.960\n because I got to explain to them what's going on here.\n\n1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:27.280\n They all know, of course,\n\n1:06:27.280 --> 1:06:29.960\n but I think they're not always maybe understanding\n\n1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:30.800\n or maybe they understand.\n\n1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:33.200\n And in this case, he understood.\n\n1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:37.040\n So we went and he's like, yeah, I know this is not,\n\n1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:39.880\n this is not very, yeah, this.\n\n1:06:39.880 --> 1:06:41.400\n And I said, what do we do now?\n\n1:06:41.400 --> 1:06:44.240\n And I saw him going through binders and binders\n\n1:06:44.240 --> 1:06:47.600\n in his office, because he's going to try to go and look\n\n1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:51.520\n where in the law can we find something\n\n1:06:51.520 --> 1:06:55.520\n that can help me escape these rules.\n\n1:06:55.520 --> 1:06:58.200\n And you know, the best he found Lex was,\n\n1:06:58.200 --> 1:07:00.800\n oh, well here, see this one.\n\n1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:03.040\n If you've been in business for two years,\n\n1:07:03.040 --> 1:07:06.720\n then we can allow you, there's a special term for it.\n\n1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:08.400\n It's French, it's technical.\n\n1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:10.880\n We can allow you to bring your raw material,\n\n1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:15.200\n but you have to tell us exactly how much you're bringing.\n\n1:07:15.200 --> 1:07:17.240\n And it has to match your formulation because, you know,\n\n1:07:17.240 --> 1:07:19.920\n they don't want you to bring in more that we need\n\n1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:21.960\n and maybe sell some of that to the rest of the market\n\n1:07:21.960 --> 1:07:24.120\n and they didn't make their money on it.\n\n1:07:24.120 --> 1:07:27.040\n So there, it means I have to give them my recipe.\n\n1:07:27.040 --> 1:07:30.800\n Imagine Coca Cola being asked to give their secret sauce\n\n1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:34.000\n to government officials in a country\n\n1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:36.320\n that you can't even know what might happen,\n\n1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:37.960\n let alone even in business, you don't do that.\n\n1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:40.000\n I mean, trade secrets are trade secrets,\n\n1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:42.480\n but here you're asked to be putting it in front\n\n1:07:42.480 --> 1:07:43.320\n of some people you don't know\n\n1:07:43.320 --> 1:07:44.600\n where it's going to go after that.\n\n1:07:44.600 --> 1:07:46.080\n Because there they get to see, okay,\n\n1:07:46.080 --> 1:07:50.080\n her recipe calls for X amount of Candelilla Wax,\n\n1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:56.000\n X amount of coconut oil.\n\n1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:57.680\n Okay, and on top of that,\n\n1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:00.360\n we have to think about how much foliage might there be or not\n\n1:08:00.360 --> 1:08:03.480\n because again, we don't want her to buffer it over there.\n\n1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:05.480\n So you have to get naked in front of them\n\n1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:06.520\n in terms of your recipe,\n\n1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:08.760\n which might end up only God knows where tomorrow,\n\n1:08:08.760 --> 1:08:11.040\n maybe competition or maybe even them,\n\n1:08:11.040 --> 1:08:12.560\n they start a business and they compete with you\n\n1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:13.640\n because we've seen that.\n\n1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:15.240\n So you have to do that.\n\n1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:18.000\n And then each time fill out a paperwork,\n\n1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:19.480\n get the approval, then it can come in.\n\n1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:21.840\n So when it can come in, you don't have to pay the tax.\n\n1:08:21.840 --> 1:08:24.040\n Oh, and by the way, you have one year,\n\n1:08:24.040 --> 1:08:26.920\n one year to make this product and get it out.\n\n1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:28.760\n And all of it needs to be back out\n\n1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:30.560\n because if any of it stays here,\n\n1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:33.200\n you're going to pay the taxes that we held up.\n\n1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:38.200\n So you're basically forced by these census laws\n\n1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:41.920\n to be dishonest if you want to succeed.\n\n1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:43.680\n All of this is so cumbersome\n\n1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:47.320\n because it means more paperwork, paperwork everywhere,\n\n1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:48.960\n maybe having to disclose your things.\n\n1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:53.800\n So me, in my case, what I did is this person said,\n\n1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:56.920\n okay, we're going to see how we can work with you.\n\n1:08:56.920 --> 1:08:58.560\n But for the first two years,\n\n1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:00.640\n we were more or less in the gray area.\n\n1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:04.200\n Yeah, so even gray area is good.\n\n1:09:04.200 --> 1:09:05.800\n Yeah, but what does it mean?\n\n1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:07.160\n In a situation like that,\n\n1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:09.240\n whenever they want to mess with you,\n\n1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:11.520\n it means they can come and they will look\n\n1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:13.240\n and they will find something.\n\n1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:15.640\n So it means that every day I'm trying to do business,\n\n1:09:15.640 --> 1:09:17.920\n I'm running the risk of being harassed\n\n1:09:17.920 --> 1:09:21.360\n and or maybe even put in jail, depending on what it is.\n\n1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:24.840\n I mean, you're an incredible person\n\n1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:28.660\n because it seems like there's two ways to change this.\n\n1:09:28.660 --> 1:09:33.660\n One is to become president or gain power in the country\n\n1:09:34.340 --> 1:09:37.120\n and to try to change the laws,\n\n1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:39.780\n which seems really difficult to do.\n\n1:09:39.780 --> 1:09:43.180\n And the other way is fight through the laws\n\n1:09:43.180 --> 1:09:45.040\n and create the business anyway,\n\n1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:47.880\n build the business community and through that method,\n\n1:09:47.880 --> 1:09:50.900\n create a huge amount of pressure to change the laws.\n\n1:09:50.900 --> 1:09:53.860\n You're totally getting it with your last part\n\n1:09:53.860 --> 1:09:55.420\n because this is the other thing.\n\n1:09:55.420 --> 1:09:58.500\n And this is where I get so upset sometimes\n\n1:09:58.500 --> 1:10:00.460\n with my fellow Africans\n\n1:10:00.460 --> 1:10:04.460\n because they get so disgusted by what they're seeing, right?\n\n1:10:04.460 --> 1:10:08.180\n And they think the answer is to go for politics.\n\n1:10:08.180 --> 1:10:09.340\n Let's go be president.\n\n1:10:09.340 --> 1:10:10.180\n Let's go be this.\n\n1:10:10.180 --> 1:10:11.000\n Let's go be that.\n\n1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:12.020\n And we're gonna change everything.\n\n1:10:12.020 --> 1:10:13.540\n I see that in the US too.\n\n1:10:13.540 --> 1:10:15.980\n People thinking that presidents have all this power.\n\n1:10:15.980 --> 1:10:17.580\n Do you know who has the least power in government?\n\n1:10:17.580 --> 1:10:18.660\n The president.\n\n1:10:18.660 --> 1:10:20.580\n I mean, people don't get that.\n\n1:10:20.580 --> 1:10:23.620\n Your best bet, if you insist on going into politics,\n\n1:10:23.620 --> 1:10:25.380\n stick to the local level.\n\n1:10:25.380 --> 1:10:28.380\n That's where all the skeletons are buried and hidden.\n\n1:10:28.380 --> 1:10:31.220\n And that's where you can make the most impact, local level.\n\n1:10:31.220 --> 1:10:32.140\n I know it's not shiny.\n\n1:10:32.140 --> 1:10:34.640\n I know it's not exciting, but that's where it's at.\n\n1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:37.920\n So if you must go into politics, but there's another way.\n\n1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:40.140\n So in my case, what I do is two things.\n\n1:10:40.140 --> 1:10:41.920\n I preach and I practice.\n\n1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:44.260\n I preach, when I'm here talking to you about this,\n\n1:10:44.260 --> 1:10:45.380\n I'm preaching.\n\n1:10:45.380 --> 1:10:48.140\n I am sharing with people that is which I found.\n\n1:10:48.140 --> 1:10:51.300\n And by the way, the answer was there.\n\n1:10:51.300 --> 1:10:52.900\n I was doing these two businesses,\n\n1:10:52.900 --> 1:10:54.880\n realizing the difference in treatment\n\n1:10:54.880 --> 1:10:58.140\n of the doing business environment\n\n1:10:58.140 --> 1:11:00.980\n of the US compared to the doing business environment\n\n1:11:00.980 --> 1:11:02.180\n of Senegal.\n\n1:11:02.180 --> 1:11:04.460\n And at first I was like, of course, us,\n\n1:11:04.460 --> 1:11:05.660\n everything is messed up.\n\n1:11:05.660 --> 1:11:07.480\n It's because we're a poor country.\n\n1:11:07.480 --> 1:11:09.660\n But when I started to put two and two together,\n\n1:11:09.660 --> 1:11:12.020\n I'm like, you're poor because you have no money,\n\n1:11:12.020 --> 1:11:14.740\n at least not enough money to take care of your basic needs.\n\n1:11:14.740 --> 1:11:17.700\n You have no money because you have no source of income.\n\n1:11:17.700 --> 1:11:21.100\n Where does a source of income come from for most of us?\n\n1:11:21.100 --> 1:11:23.540\n It comes from a job, doesn't it?\n\n1:11:23.540 --> 1:11:26.220\n And then some people, sometimes at my UC Berkeley class,\n\n1:11:26.220 --> 1:11:29.100\n they say, oh no, it comes from government too.\n\n1:11:29.100 --> 1:11:30.980\n I'm like, I would like to think that even if you work\n\n1:11:30.980 --> 1:11:32.500\n for government, you're going to be paid something, right?\n\n1:11:32.500 --> 1:11:33.340\n And they're like, yeah.\n\n1:11:33.340 --> 1:11:35.780\n And then even before I can say something, they're like,\n\n1:11:35.780 --> 1:11:39.420\n yeah, because that money we use to pay our public officials\n\n1:11:39.420 --> 1:11:43.680\n comes from taxes, you know, employers, employees,\n\n1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:45.980\n we go back to the private sector for most of it,\n\n1:11:45.980 --> 1:11:47.940\n from where this whole thing is created.\n\n1:11:47.940 --> 1:11:52.060\n So it's clear, you're poor because you have no money,\n\n1:11:52.060 --> 1:11:53.580\n no money because no source of income,\n\n1:11:53.580 --> 1:11:55.340\n source of income for most of us is a job.\n\n1:11:55.340 --> 1:11:57.940\n We're talking about, so where do jobs come from?\n\n1:11:57.940 --> 1:12:00.020\n The private sector, primarily small\n\n1:12:00.020 --> 1:12:01.540\n and medium sized enterprises.\n\n1:12:01.540 --> 1:12:06.500\n Then don't you think that we should make it easy,\n\n1:12:06.500 --> 1:12:11.500\n that we should have a friendly doing business environment.\n\n1:12:12.660 --> 1:12:17.660\n And also a lot of it comes not just from the small\n\n1:12:17.780 --> 1:12:21.900\n and medium sized businesses, but I think a lot\n\n1:12:21.900 --> 1:12:26.300\n of the values created from new ones being launched, right?\n\n1:12:26.300 --> 1:12:29.220\n It's not just like me, like saving somehow\n\n1:12:29.220 --> 1:12:32.540\n through regulation, the ones that are already there.\n\n1:12:32.540 --> 1:12:35.460\n It's like letting the market,\n\n1:12:35.460 --> 1:12:38.940\n letting the new better ideas flourish.\n\n1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:42.100\n It's about what I mean by doing business environment\n\n1:12:42.100 --> 1:12:45.420\n is all the things that you and I talked about earlier.\n\n1:12:45.420 --> 1:12:47.860\n Even the access of electricity is part\n\n1:12:47.860 --> 1:12:49.700\n of a doing business, but doing business.\n\n1:12:49.700 --> 1:12:52.060\n So basically when I discovered all of that,\n\n1:12:52.060 --> 1:12:54.180\n when I put all of those dots together,\n\n1:12:54.180 --> 1:12:56.540\n then I'm like, well, I guess the business,\n\n1:12:56.540 --> 1:12:58.060\n and it makes sense, Lex.\n\n1:12:58.060 --> 1:12:59.780\n If you want to grow tomatoes,\n\n1:12:59.780 --> 1:13:01.220\n you're gonna have to have two things.\n\n1:13:01.220 --> 1:13:05.940\n One is a good seed, right, that has good attributes.\n\n1:13:05.940 --> 1:13:09.580\n And then you're gonna have to have a good environment\n\n1:13:09.580 --> 1:13:10.580\n for it.\n\n1:13:10.580 --> 1:13:12.420\n Is the soil the right one?\n\n1:13:12.420 --> 1:13:14.180\n What's your pH level?\n\n1:13:14.180 --> 1:13:16.100\n All of those good nutrients that you're gonna put in it.\n\n1:13:16.100 --> 1:13:18.180\n Is it in a place that has tons of sun?\n\n1:13:18.180 --> 1:13:19.940\n How much sun exposure or not?\n\n1:13:19.940 --> 1:13:21.500\n The climate in general, is it gonna be cold?\n\n1:13:21.500 --> 1:13:22.460\n Not, not.\n\n1:13:22.460 --> 1:13:25.140\n You can have some beautiful tomatoes\n\n1:13:25.140 --> 1:13:27.340\n in the middle of Siberia, last time I checked.\n\n1:13:27.340 --> 1:13:28.500\n So same thing here.\n\n1:13:28.500 --> 1:13:33.060\n You know, Mohammed Yunus, the Nobel Laureate for Peace,\n\n1:13:33.060 --> 1:13:36.620\n said, poor people are bonsai people.\n\n1:13:38.460 --> 1:13:40.380\n They're the same people.\n\n1:13:40.380 --> 1:13:44.860\n If you put them in the normal, natural, friendly habitat\n\n1:13:44.860 --> 1:13:48.220\n where they can thrive, they become the tallest tree\n\n1:13:48.220 --> 1:13:49.620\n in the forest.\n\n1:13:49.620 --> 1:13:51.380\n Poor people are bonsai people.\n\n1:13:51.380 --> 1:13:55.460\n So you see that tiny pot you put around the bonsai tree?\n\n1:13:55.460 --> 1:13:57.940\n That's the tiny pot that's created\n\n1:13:57.940 --> 1:14:02.020\n by giving me such a hostile business environment\n\n1:14:02.020 --> 1:14:05.420\n that basically we're put together by the set of laws\n\n1:14:05.420 --> 1:14:08.980\n that you have put, that basically I have to jump through\n\n1:14:08.980 --> 1:14:12.820\n as a business person, practicing business in my country.\n\n1:14:12.820 --> 1:14:17.820\n If you turn that environment into a friendly environment\n\n1:14:18.100 --> 1:14:20.660\n where I am not married to my employees,\n\n1:14:20.660 --> 1:14:24.180\n I have flexibility of the labor laws\n\n1:14:24.180 --> 1:14:26.900\n are simple, straightforward, clean,\n\n1:14:26.900 --> 1:14:29.580\n where the tax code is very simple.\n\n1:14:29.580 --> 1:14:32.500\n It's not worth truckloads of laws like in my country.\n\n1:14:32.500 --> 1:14:33.580\n It's so complicated.\n\n1:14:33.580 --> 1:14:36.060\n You have to hire a CPA, which costs more money.\n\n1:14:36.060 --> 1:14:38.620\n And even them tell them, girl, we're gonna make some mistakes.\n\n1:14:38.620 --> 1:14:39.940\n They don't talk to me like that.\n\n1:14:39.940 --> 1:14:43.500\n They don't tell me, girl, they shouldn't, they better not.\n\n1:14:43.500 --> 1:14:45.460\n But they say, whatever they say.\n\n1:14:45.460 --> 1:14:46.300\n They say.\n\n1:14:46.300 --> 1:14:47.140\n I'm scared.\n\n1:14:47.140 --> 1:14:47.980\n You know.\n\n1:14:47.980 --> 1:14:51.420\n You know, they're like, we're gonna,\n\n1:14:51.420 --> 1:14:53.700\n but bottom line is we're gonna make mistakes.\n\n1:14:53.700 --> 1:14:55.460\n This thing is so complicated, we're gonna make mistakes.\n\n1:14:55.460 --> 1:14:57.940\n So, which means my ass is on the line.\n\n1:14:57.940 --> 1:15:02.020\n So anyway, so if the tax code was so simple,\n\n1:15:02.020 --> 1:15:04.540\n straightforward, like it is maybe in Texas,\n\n1:15:04.540 --> 1:15:07.380\n where up till a threshold, you owe me nothing,\n\n1:15:07.380 --> 1:15:10.380\n go online, five minutes, fill out your taxes,\n\n1:15:10.380 --> 1:15:13.660\n you're compliant, keep building your business\n\n1:15:13.660 --> 1:15:15.100\n because that's what we need from you.\n\n1:15:15.100 --> 1:15:19.860\n If you made it so easy and straightforward,\n\n1:15:19.860 --> 1:15:20.820\n then you know what?\n\n1:15:20.820 --> 1:15:22.740\n That's when you get all of these people,\n\n1:15:22.740 --> 1:15:25.740\n Lex, that you're talking about saying, you know what?\n\n1:15:25.740 --> 1:15:28.380\n My name is Aminata,\n\n1:15:28.380 --> 1:15:30.580\n and I live in the middle of nowhere, Senegal.\n\n1:15:30.580 --> 1:15:31.420\n But you know what?\n\n1:15:31.420 --> 1:15:33.500\n I've got this great idea for this really hot,\n\n1:15:33.500 --> 1:15:35.860\n nice hot sauce that I know the Americans are gonna love.\n\n1:15:35.860 --> 1:15:38.460\n I'm hearing that hot sauce is a big thing.\n\n1:15:38.460 --> 1:15:39.900\n Let me bring it to them.\n\n1:15:39.900 --> 1:15:41.620\n But everything is there for you to jump\n\n1:15:41.620 --> 1:15:44.020\n into the ring of entrepreneurship.\n\n1:15:44.020 --> 1:15:47.220\n You don't have to know someone like my God.\n\n1:15:47.220 --> 1:15:50.300\n You don't have to even have the ability\n\n1:15:50.300 --> 1:15:53.260\n to sell yourself maybe like I can sometimes.\n\n1:15:53.260 --> 1:15:57.180\n You are someone with a great idea.\n\n1:15:57.180 --> 1:15:59.340\n You're willing to work hard for it\n\n1:15:59.340 --> 1:16:00.860\n and pour everything you got into it.\n\n1:16:00.860 --> 1:16:01.700\n Guess what?\n\n1:16:03.260 --> 1:16:04.100\n It's there.\n\n1:16:04.100 --> 1:16:05.380\n You can get into the race.\n\n1:16:05.380 --> 1:16:07.020\n You can be a dreamer,\n\n1:16:07.020 --> 1:16:09.780\n and you can be a dreamer in a rural little village.\n\n1:16:09.780 --> 1:16:11.580\n And then that has ripple effects\n\n1:16:11.580 --> 1:16:12.660\n throughout the entire country.\n\n1:16:12.660 --> 1:16:14.180\n Young kids growing up, you know,\n\n1:16:14.180 --> 1:16:16.820\n I wanna be the next X, whatever.\n\n1:16:16.820 --> 1:16:19.860\n And it doesn't have to be the next Steve Jobs.\n\n1:16:19.860 --> 1:16:21.980\n That seems really far, far away.\n\n1:16:21.980 --> 1:16:23.660\n It's at all levels.\n\n1:16:23.660 --> 1:16:28.660\n You create local heroes because representation matters.\n\n1:16:29.740 --> 1:16:30.580\n Right?\n\n1:16:30.580 --> 1:16:33.900\n So, and we are so badly in need of that.\n\n1:16:33.900 --> 1:16:36.140\n And so that's what all the things\n\n1:16:36.140 --> 1:16:37.340\n that have been stolen from us\n\n1:16:37.340 --> 1:16:39.300\n as long as things remain the same.\n\n1:16:39.300 --> 1:16:42.820\n So Lex, once I found out that basically at the end of the day\n\n1:16:42.820 --> 1:16:45.060\n the answer is economic freedom.\n\n1:16:45.060 --> 1:16:46.460\n And that when it comes to that,\n\n1:16:46.460 --> 1:16:48.980\n the indexes, economic indexes that measure that,\n\n1:16:48.980 --> 1:16:50.620\n whether it's the doing business index ranking\n\n1:16:50.620 --> 1:16:51.580\n of the World Bank,\n\n1:16:51.580 --> 1:16:54.380\n or the Fraser Economic Freedom Index\n\n1:16:54.380 --> 1:16:56.060\n of the Heritage Foundation.\n\n1:16:56.060 --> 1:16:58.740\n When you look at all of those indexes and others,\n\n1:16:58.740 --> 1:17:00.540\n what do they have in common?\n\n1:17:00.540 --> 1:17:02.100\n One after another they show you\n\n1:17:02.100 --> 1:17:04.340\n that it is harder to do business\n\n1:17:04.340 --> 1:17:06.340\n in almost anywhere in Sub Saharan Africa\n\n1:17:06.340 --> 1:17:10.340\n than it is per se anywhere in Scandinavia.\n\n1:17:10.340 --> 1:17:13.740\n So it is telling you that Scandinavian nations,\n\n1:17:13.740 --> 1:17:16.260\n that socialist Americans tend to love so much\n\n1:17:16.260 --> 1:17:17.340\n and take as an example,\n\n1:17:17.340 --> 1:17:18.500\n although there too they're showing you\n\n1:17:18.500 --> 1:17:19.340\n that they don't understand\n\n1:17:19.340 --> 1:17:21.940\n what's going on really in Scandinavia,\n\n1:17:21.940 --> 1:17:25.180\n that Scandinavia is more capitalist.\n\n1:17:25.180 --> 1:17:27.140\n Scandinavian nations are more capitalist\n\n1:17:27.140 --> 1:17:30.260\n than almost any Sub Saharan African nations.\n\n1:17:30.260 --> 1:17:32.820\n Ultimately, the political systems\n\n1:17:32.820 --> 1:17:35.940\n actually don't even matter nearly as much\n\n1:17:35.940 --> 1:17:39.660\n as the private sector being able\n\n1:17:39.660 --> 1:17:42.220\n to operate the machinery of capitalism.\n\n1:17:42.220 --> 1:17:45.100\n There you go, there you go, there you go.\n\n1:17:45.100 --> 1:17:47.140\n And it's almost like, like I said,\n\n1:17:47.140 --> 1:17:49.660\n it's almost like its own little widget within it.\n\n1:17:49.660 --> 1:17:51.380\n You can have whatever type of society\n\n1:17:51.380 --> 1:17:52.220\n you want to practice,\n\n1:17:52.220 --> 1:17:55.420\n you want to exercise at whatever level you want to.\n\n1:17:55.420 --> 1:17:59.420\n But if you're serious about becoming a capitalist,\n\n1:17:59.420 --> 1:18:03.660\n becoming a middle to high income nation,\n\n1:18:03.660 --> 1:18:07.740\n there is no other pathway that we know of at this point.\n\n1:18:07.740 --> 1:18:11.300\n And you know what made me super excited about that\n\n1:18:11.300 --> 1:18:15.220\n beyond having finally found my answer.\n\n1:18:16.700 --> 1:18:18.700\n I have to tell you when I found that answer,\n\n1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:21.180\n I literally fell to my knees.\n\n1:18:21.180 --> 1:18:23.260\n It was the type of feeling that,\n\n1:18:24.540 --> 1:18:28.340\n you know, if something is not well with you,\n\n1:18:28.340 --> 1:18:30.460\n whether it's physical or mental,\n\n1:18:30.460 --> 1:18:32.820\n something is not well, you're not well.\n\n1:18:32.820 --> 1:18:35.540\n And you go around and you go to the so called specialists,\n\n1:18:35.540 --> 1:18:37.260\n some of them, you know,\n\n1:18:37.260 --> 1:18:39.180\n but you're going around for years,\n\n1:18:39.180 --> 1:18:42.860\n going around trying to get help for your ailment.\n\n1:18:42.860 --> 1:18:45.700\n And here they don't know.\n\n1:18:45.700 --> 1:18:48.500\n Here they tell you things that you can't tell why,\n\n1:18:48.500 --> 1:18:50.340\n but you just know it's not true.\n\n1:18:50.340 --> 1:18:51.940\n They're this, they're that.\n\n1:18:51.940 --> 1:18:54.340\n And it's going on for years after year after year.\n\n1:18:54.340 --> 1:18:56.740\n And finally you meet this one person\n\n1:18:56.740 --> 1:19:00.020\n and boom, it's there.\n\n1:19:01.620 --> 1:19:02.940\n Not only the liberation,\n\n1:19:05.260 --> 1:19:07.860\n but also this whole new world that comes with it.\n\n1:19:07.860 --> 1:19:12.860\n You know, I'm still ill, but guess what?\n\n1:19:13.020 --> 1:19:14.620\n There's a path forward.\n\n1:19:14.620 --> 1:19:16.300\n We know that.\n\n1:19:16.300 --> 1:19:20.020\n I'm going to have a lot of work to do, but there's hope.\n\n1:19:20.020 --> 1:19:23.900\n Yeah, and you're the beacon of hope actually,\n\n1:19:23.900 --> 1:19:25.820\n for a lot of people in that part of the world.\n\n1:19:25.820 --> 1:19:28.260\n And those beacons are actually really necessary.\n\n1:19:28.260 --> 1:19:32.540\n So not only is there hope, but you can become,\n\n1:19:32.540 --> 1:19:37.540\n I mean, the beacon for your people, your home,\n\n1:19:37.900 --> 1:19:40.820\n this power that you see that you feel all around\n\n1:19:40.820 --> 1:19:45.820\n to become, to escape the feeling of being trapped.\n\n1:19:46.500 --> 1:19:51.260\n Is there a device you can give to people that,\n\n1:19:51.260 --> 1:19:56.260\n to young girls and boys dreaming somewhere in Africa\n\n1:19:56.820 --> 1:19:58.900\n of how to change the world?\n\n1:19:58.900 --> 1:19:59.740\n That's right.\n\n1:19:59.740 --> 1:20:03.060\n And by the way, I want to say there are bigger beacons.\n\n1:20:03.060 --> 1:20:05.180\n There are better beacons than me.\n\n1:20:05.180 --> 1:20:08.940\n I just happen to be someone who has the chance\n\n1:20:08.940 --> 1:20:10.340\n of talking to you right now.\n\n1:20:11.620 --> 1:20:14.540\n And one of my goals is to open the same doors\n\n1:20:14.540 --> 1:20:17.500\n that were opened for me, because together, our voice,\n\n1:20:17.500 --> 1:20:20.180\n there's such amazing stories out there.\n\n1:20:20.180 --> 1:20:25.180\n And so bigger beacons, better beacons out there.\n\n1:20:26.460 --> 1:20:31.460\n One thing here for me, the reason why I do\n\n1:20:32.140 --> 1:20:34.860\n what I'm doing right now, and it's almost to a point\n\n1:20:34.860 --> 1:20:36.660\n of self destructing my own health.\n\n1:20:37.740 --> 1:20:41.100\n I feel invested with such the mission of,\n\n1:20:41.100 --> 1:20:43.620\n I have been afforded the truth.\n\n1:20:43.620 --> 1:20:45.980\n So it is my moral duty to try to take it around.\n\n1:20:45.980 --> 1:20:48.260\n I know I sound, people sometimes say,\n\n1:20:48.260 --> 1:20:51.900\n when I listen to you, I feel like I'm talking to a priest.\n\n1:20:51.900 --> 1:20:56.900\n And I'm like, because the gospel, I receive the gospel.\n\n1:20:56.900 --> 1:20:59.660\n So anyway, but the thing is, Lex,\n\n1:20:59.660 --> 1:21:03.140\n who tells you these things to this day?\n\n1:21:03.140 --> 1:21:04.980\n When they talk about the poverty of Africa,\n\n1:21:04.980 --> 1:21:06.220\n what do they talk about?\n\n1:21:06.220 --> 1:21:07.140\n They sit in front telling you,\n\n1:21:07.140 --> 1:21:08.580\n oh yeah, it's because of colonialism.\n\n1:21:08.580 --> 1:21:09.980\n It's because of racism.\n\n1:21:09.980 --> 1:21:11.260\n It's because of imperialism.\n\n1:21:11.260 --> 1:21:14.580\n It's because they're stealing raw material, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:21:14.580 --> 1:21:19.580\n Is any of those guilty to some level of where we are today?\n\n1:21:21.220 --> 1:21:23.820\n Maybe part of the reason where we are today?\n\n1:21:23.820 --> 1:21:25.740\n Maybe, maybe.\n\n1:21:25.740 --> 1:21:29.420\n Is that the only reason or the overwhelming reasons?\n\n1:21:29.420 --> 1:21:30.420\n No.\n\n1:21:30.420 --> 1:21:31.900\n Is that insurmountable?\n\n1:21:31.900 --> 1:21:33.340\n Absolutely not.\n\n1:21:33.340 --> 1:21:36.020\n So for me, don't stay in that place\n\n1:21:36.020 --> 1:21:40.100\n that steals and robs you of your agency.\n\n1:21:40.100 --> 1:21:43.140\n So I think it's important for people to A,\n\n1:21:43.140 --> 1:21:45.820\n get the right diagnosis as to why we are where we are.\n\n1:21:45.820 --> 1:21:48.020\n Because what you and I just talked about,\n\n1:21:48.020 --> 1:21:50.660\n the mainstream does not talk about this\n\n1:21:50.660 --> 1:21:52.580\n when they even talk about Africa\n\n1:21:52.580 --> 1:21:55.580\n in terms that are not the usual suspect of,\n\n1:21:55.580 --> 1:21:57.580\n oh, famine is building over there.\n\n1:21:57.580 --> 1:21:58.660\n War is building over here.\n\n1:21:58.660 --> 1:22:00.180\n Oh, we're having Ebola is coming.\n\n1:22:00.180 --> 1:22:01.020\n All of that stuff.\n\n1:22:01.020 --> 1:22:02.780\n Even when they were talking about the monkeypox,\n\n1:22:02.780 --> 1:22:05.540\n which at first, in this wave,\n\n1:22:05.540 --> 1:22:07.620\n it started with white people in Europe.\n\n1:22:07.620 --> 1:22:09.820\n Well, even in the many newspapers you pull out,\n\n1:22:09.820 --> 1:22:13.660\n it's black people with monkeypox on their skin.\n\n1:22:13.660 --> 1:22:14.580\n I'm like, wait a second.\n\n1:22:14.580 --> 1:22:17.020\n This time around, it did not start with us.\n\n1:22:17.020 --> 1:22:18.820\n So why are you always showing us\n\n1:22:18.820 --> 1:22:21.780\n when it's right now happening to white people?\n\n1:22:21.780 --> 1:22:24.060\n So all of that is happening.\n\n1:22:24.060 --> 1:22:26.380\n So for me, the thing is,\n\n1:22:26.380 --> 1:22:29.380\n we, the world simply right now,\n\n1:22:29.380 --> 1:22:32.060\n does not have the right diagnosis\n\n1:22:32.060 --> 1:22:34.260\n as to why this continent right now,\n\n1:22:34.260 --> 1:22:36.180\n despite all of its riches,\n\n1:22:36.180 --> 1:22:37.900\n because Lord knows it's got riches\n\n1:22:37.900 --> 1:22:40.140\n starting it with its young population.\n\n1:22:40.140 --> 1:22:42.020\n 75% of the population in my country\n\n1:22:42.020 --> 1:22:44.260\n is below the age of 25 years old.\n\n1:22:44.260 --> 1:22:47.660\n So when we're talking, I know we're talking about,\n\n1:22:47.660 --> 1:22:50.540\n repopulation, it's an important,\n\n1:22:50.540 --> 1:22:52.220\n we're gonna have to go for that.\n\n1:22:53.220 --> 1:22:54.580\n Maybe you'll get me going about comments,\n\n1:22:54.580 --> 1:22:57.060\n I don't know, but anyway.\n\n1:22:57.060 --> 1:22:58.380\n So here, my point is,\n\n1:22:58.380 --> 1:22:59.820\n A, we need the right diagnosis\n\n1:22:59.820 --> 1:23:02.220\n as to why this continent is the poorest continent\n\n1:23:02.220 --> 1:23:03.780\n in the world, despite its riches\n\n1:23:03.780 --> 1:23:05.700\n starting with its young people,\n\n1:23:05.700 --> 1:23:08.540\n all the natural resources, diversity in land,\n\n1:23:08.540 --> 1:23:10.500\n people, cultures, languages,\n\n1:23:10.500 --> 1:23:15.380\n everything that make for great ingredient for awesomeness.\n\n1:23:15.380 --> 1:23:16.540\n Despite all of that,\n\n1:23:16.540 --> 1:23:18.300\n we are the poorest region in the world.\n\n1:23:18.300 --> 1:23:21.500\n People need to know that the reason why that is,\n\n1:23:21.500 --> 1:23:23.660\n it's because we also happen to be\n\n1:23:23.660 --> 1:23:27.420\n the most overregulated region in the world.\n\n1:23:27.420 --> 1:23:30.140\n At the end of the day, what Africa,\n\n1:23:30.140 --> 1:23:32.060\n and I dare to say Africa here,\n\n1:23:32.060 --> 1:23:34.020\n and treated as one,\n\n1:23:34.020 --> 1:23:37.220\n we are 54 countries, 55 depending on how you count,\n\n1:23:37.220 --> 1:23:42.220\n yet we almost for a tiny minority of these countries,\n\n1:23:43.220 --> 1:23:48.100\n we almost all lack one of the most crucial freedoms\n\n1:23:48.100 --> 1:23:49.300\n that there are.\n\n1:23:49.300 --> 1:23:51.700\n If you're serious about prosperity building,\n\n1:23:51.700 --> 1:23:54.300\n we lack economic freedom.\n\n1:23:54.300 --> 1:23:55.820\n And economic freedom is the thing\n\n1:23:55.820 --> 1:23:58.740\n that unlocks that human potential of the young people just.\n\n1:23:58.740 --> 1:24:01.220\n Yes, for them to run,\n\n1:24:01.220 --> 1:24:05.140\n to run with their ideas, to start businesses,\n\n1:24:05.140 --> 1:24:06.340\n or to start initiative.\n\n1:24:06.340 --> 1:24:08.900\n It doesn't have to be for profit all the time, right?\n\n1:24:08.900 --> 1:24:12.660\n But it is this thing that gets you to get up\n\n1:24:12.660 --> 1:24:15.980\n and go and do something, criticize by creating.\n\n1:24:15.980 --> 1:24:17.620\n Young people are naturally wired\n\n1:24:17.620 --> 1:24:19.300\n to wanna criticize by creating.\n\n1:24:19.300 --> 1:24:21.900\n They're not sitting around waiting or complaining usually,\n\n1:24:21.900 --> 1:24:23.260\n unless you put them in a tiny box\n\n1:24:23.260 --> 1:24:24.740\n and they have no other way to go.\n\n1:24:24.740 --> 1:24:26.940\n And in this situation, what they do,\n\n1:24:26.940 --> 1:24:29.180\n let's talk about precolonial Africa,\n\n1:24:29.180 --> 1:24:33.060\n of four favors before slavery ever happened.\n\n1:24:33.060 --> 1:24:35.300\n There were black people on the continent.\n\n1:24:35.300 --> 1:24:37.660\n You see, when we talk about the story of black people\n\n1:24:37.660 --> 1:24:40.980\n and Africans, black people in Africa,\n\n1:24:40.980 --> 1:24:42.700\n for most of us, even me,\n\n1:24:43.860 --> 1:24:46.980\n I noticed that unconsciously it starts with slavery.\n\n1:24:46.980 --> 1:24:49.140\n But you're like, no, we were there before,\n\n1:24:49.140 --> 1:24:50.340\n before white men ever set foot.\n\n1:24:50.340 --> 1:24:51.340\n Who were we?\n\n1:24:51.340 --> 1:24:54.460\n What were we doing in our diversity?\n\n1:24:54.460 --> 1:24:58.500\n What economic systems were we running on?\n\n1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:00.420\n And then you realize that for most of them,\n\n1:25:00.420 --> 1:25:02.060\n they were free marketeers\n\n1:25:02.060 --> 1:25:03.620\n and they were very much on the free trade,\n\n1:25:03.620 --> 1:25:05.340\n on the free enterprise side.\n\n1:25:05.340 --> 1:25:07.300\n So even that is a reinforcement.\n\n1:25:07.300 --> 1:25:11.820\n This is a place where we do not understand our history.\n\n1:25:11.820 --> 1:25:14.940\n So proper diagnosis, Africa is a poorest region in the world\n\n1:25:14.940 --> 1:25:16.260\n because it happens to be\n\n1:25:16.260 --> 1:25:19.060\n the most overregulated region in the world,\n\n1:25:19.060 --> 1:25:20.820\n lacks economic freedom.\n\n1:25:20.820 --> 1:25:22.540\n Number two, what do we do about that?\n\n1:25:22.540 --> 1:25:25.940\n We gotta become serious about reforms, economic reforms,\n\n1:25:25.940 --> 1:25:30.940\n so that we can become beacons of free markets.\n\n1:25:30.940 --> 1:25:32.420\n Just like the Asian tigers,\n\n1:25:32.420 --> 1:25:33.980\n that's what the Asian tigers did.\n\n1:25:33.980 --> 1:25:35.300\n They had to become serious.\n\n1:25:35.300 --> 1:25:38.780\n Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea,\n\n1:25:38.780 --> 1:25:43.140\n those guys had to become serious about the free markets.\n\n1:25:43.140 --> 1:25:48.140\n Lee Kuan Woo, he's just like, we gotta do something.\n\n1:25:48.740 --> 1:25:51.900\n And he looked around and he realized at some point,\n\n1:25:51.900 --> 1:25:53.220\n we gotta make these reforms.\n\n1:25:53.220 --> 1:25:56.180\n And he went onto that journey of reforms,\n\n1:25:56.180 --> 1:25:59.060\n making his country one of the most free market countries\n\n1:25:59.060 --> 1:26:02.100\n in the world, and voila, the magic happened.\n\n1:26:02.100 --> 1:26:05.860\n Back in the 30s, the stock market crash\n\n1:26:05.860 --> 1:26:08.100\n and the Great Depression and everything,\n\n1:26:08.100 --> 1:26:11.300\n the world and with all the lies that were told\n\n1:26:11.300 --> 1:26:15.020\n to the world coming from the Soviet Union, Stalin,\n\n1:26:15.020 --> 1:26:17.380\n while they were starving and dying over there,\n\n1:26:17.380 --> 1:26:20.660\n but oh no, I mean, Durante was telling the world that,\n\n1:26:20.660 --> 1:26:22.140\n oh no, no, everything is going well,\n\n1:26:22.140 --> 1:26:24.100\n nobody's dying when we know now\n\n1:26:24.100 --> 1:26:26.460\n and getting political prices based on this stuff.\n\n1:26:26.460 --> 1:26:29.060\n But then the world went on believing that,\n\n1:26:29.060 --> 1:26:31.580\n oh no, capitalism failed.\n\n1:26:31.580 --> 1:26:36.580\n This crash that you had in the stock market\n\n1:26:37.780 --> 1:26:40.820\n is proof this is what late stage capitalism produces.\n\n1:26:40.820 --> 1:26:42.900\n You guys always have your big ups and downs.\n\n1:26:42.900 --> 1:26:44.740\n And by that time, it was so hard on people\n\n1:26:44.740 --> 1:26:46.300\n that they're like, we're done with this.\n\n1:26:46.300 --> 1:26:48.180\n And at the same time, we were told the lies\n\n1:26:48.180 --> 1:26:49.020\n coming out of the Soviet Union,\n\n1:26:49.020 --> 1:26:51.780\n that supposedly the communism was doing just fine.\n\n1:26:51.780 --> 1:26:54.500\n And you're at the point where the free market concept\n\n1:26:54.500 --> 1:26:59.500\n almost died and it's the Asian tigers\n\n1:26:59.780 --> 1:27:04.460\n who kind of helped bring that idea back to life, right?\n\n1:27:04.460 --> 1:27:06.740\n Their success having used the free markets.\n\n1:27:06.740 --> 1:27:11.580\n And so for me, we gotta make a new commitment\n\n1:27:11.580 --> 1:27:12.980\n to the free markets on this continent\n\n1:27:12.980 --> 1:27:15.620\n if we wanna go anywhere, if we wanna go anywhere.\n\n1:27:15.620 --> 1:27:18.660\n And the timing is perfect because the young people,\n\n1:27:18.660 --> 1:27:22.660\n there is a kind of freedom\n\n1:27:22.660 --> 1:27:25.740\n for the revolutionary free markets in this whole space.\n\n1:27:25.740 --> 1:27:28.980\n Exactly, and you said something, oh, say that again,\n\n1:27:28.980 --> 1:27:30.780\n because I wanna tell you what I'm hearing in that,\n\n1:27:30.780 --> 1:27:31.700\n because something's really cool.\n\n1:27:31.700 --> 1:27:32.940\n Say it again, come on, Lex.\n\n1:27:32.940 --> 1:27:36.460\n I don't know which part, English is my second language too.\n\n1:27:36.460 --> 1:27:40.620\n No, you said there's something revolutionary in that.\n\n1:27:40.620 --> 1:27:41.900\n Because you know how young people are attached\n\n1:27:41.900 --> 1:27:45.140\n to the revolution and how, I understand,\n\n1:27:45.140 --> 1:27:49.540\n look Lex, I understand and I am willing\n\n1:27:49.540 --> 1:27:51.900\n to give the benefits of a doubt\n\n1:27:51.900 --> 1:27:55.700\n to some of these socialists who came to it\n\n1:27:55.700 --> 1:27:58.260\n because they had to witness\n\n1:27:58.260 --> 1:28:02.020\n some of the horrors of their times.\n\n1:28:03.300 --> 1:28:05.180\n There's a revolutionary spirit behind that.\n\n1:28:05.180 --> 1:28:08.740\n It's ultimately criticized by creating.\n\n1:28:08.740 --> 1:28:11.300\n Exactly, exactly, but violent revolution\n\n1:28:11.300 --> 1:28:12.660\n is never the answer.\n\n1:28:12.660 --> 1:28:15.380\n But that's what they went for in 1789 in France,\n\n1:28:15.380 --> 1:28:19.260\n the French Revolution, and Marx and Engels,\n\n1:28:19.260 --> 1:28:21.820\n they're promoting these ideas that usually,\n\n1:28:21.820 --> 1:28:24.060\n for them, justifies violent revolution.\n\n1:28:24.060 --> 1:28:25.540\n Then in all of these people,\n\n1:28:27.020 --> 1:28:30.020\n I am with them when they say that they want\n\n1:28:30.020 --> 1:28:32.020\n to see equal rights for people.\n\n1:28:32.020 --> 1:28:33.420\n Of course, I don't agree with their,\n\n1:28:33.420 --> 1:28:36.980\n therefore, we need to push for equal outcomes.\n\n1:28:36.980 --> 1:28:39.740\n Equal rights is right, but equal outcomes is not right.\n\n1:28:39.740 --> 1:28:43.060\n But I am with them for all the way to equal rights,\n\n1:28:43.060 --> 1:28:45.780\n but this is where the two paths go this way.\n\n1:28:45.780 --> 1:28:50.220\n And also, the fact that they have no issue\n\n1:28:50.220 --> 1:28:53.460\n with violent revolution, people get killed.\n\n1:28:53.460 --> 1:28:57.500\n People get put in gulags and people get, that's not right.\n\n1:28:57.500 --> 1:28:59.820\n So what you just said here, just give me goosebumps,\n\n1:28:59.820 --> 1:29:02.860\n because there is revolution in the free markets,\n\n1:29:02.860 --> 1:29:04.740\n but that's the type of revolution we want.\n\n1:29:04.740 --> 1:29:07.220\n The revolution that comes from people creating,\n\n1:29:07.220 --> 1:29:09.620\n criticizing by creating, it's one of the best forms\n\n1:29:09.620 --> 1:29:10.500\n of revolution.\n\n1:29:10.500 --> 1:29:14.820\n If you ask me, that's the most sexy way of revolution.\n\n1:29:14.820 --> 1:29:16.340\n Criticize by creating, but what,\n\n1:29:16.340 --> 1:29:18.540\n you're gonna go shoot people or be like,\n\n1:29:18.540 --> 1:29:22.700\n what's his name, Che Guevara, who tells you,\n\n1:29:22.700 --> 1:29:25.140\n I love, it's in writing, I love nothing more\n\n1:29:25.140 --> 1:29:30.140\n than to fry the brain of a man with his gun, really?\n\n1:29:30.780 --> 1:29:35.620\n Well, in terms of sexy, there is power in that message\n\n1:29:35.620 --> 1:29:40.620\n of the oppressor, the abuser, the enemy that has abused\n\n1:29:41.060 --> 1:29:44.260\n their power, they need to be destroyed,\n\n1:29:44.260 --> 1:29:47.620\n and there's power in the message of that violence.\n\n1:29:47.620 --> 1:29:49.420\n Unfortunately, the lessons of history show\n\n1:29:49.420 --> 1:29:53.140\n that the violence, one, doesn't work,\n\n1:29:53.140 --> 1:29:55.900\n but it does the following.\n\n1:29:55.900 --> 1:29:57.460\n There is something about human nature,\n\n1:29:57.460 --> 1:29:59.580\n as the old cliche goes, that power corrupts\n\n1:29:59.580 --> 1:30:01.660\n and absolute power corrupts absolutely,\n\n1:30:01.660 --> 1:30:05.580\n is the people who are in charge of committing that violence\n\n1:30:05.580 --> 1:30:07.780\n it does something to their head.\n\n1:30:07.780 --> 1:30:10.940\n The first person you kill, the second person you kill,\n\n1:30:10.940 --> 1:30:13.940\n for some reason, you lose your ability,\n\n1:30:13.940 --> 1:30:16.140\n the compassion for other humans.\n\n1:30:16.140 --> 1:30:18.580\n Even if you began as a revolutionary,\n\n1:30:18.580 --> 1:30:21.340\n as the Soviets did, fighting for the worker,\n\n1:30:21.340 --> 1:30:26.020\n for the rights and the basic humanity of the people\n\n1:30:26.020 --> 1:30:31.020\n that really do the work, you lose the plot somehow\n\n1:30:31.620 --> 1:30:33.620\n because of the violence.\n\n1:30:33.620 --> 1:30:36.620\n So in that way, it seems like the lesson,\n\n1:30:36.620 --> 1:30:38.780\n at least of this part of the human history,\n\n1:30:38.780 --> 1:30:42.820\n until the robots take over, is that the economic freedom,\n\n1:30:44.340 --> 1:30:46.860\n free markets, and protecting those,\n\n1:30:46.860 --> 1:30:51.860\n and allowing anyone from your country to dream\n\n1:30:53.420 --> 1:30:56.340\n and to make that dream a reality by creating it\n\n1:30:56.340 --> 1:31:01.340\n with as few sort of roadblocks as possible.\n\n1:31:01.340 --> 1:31:05.780\n Exactly, so that's why for me, the message is very clear,\n\n1:31:05.780 --> 1:31:07.500\n is what we talked about today.\n\n1:31:07.500 --> 1:31:09.500\n The reason why Africa is the poorest region in the world\n\n1:31:09.500 --> 1:31:13.060\n is because it happens to be the most overregulated region\n\n1:31:13.060 --> 1:31:17.980\n in the world, and for some people who might be put off by it\n\n1:31:17.980 --> 1:31:20.500\n because they're like, oh, she's talking about laissez faire!\n\n1:31:20.500 --> 1:31:24.740\n No, let me put it maybe in a way that you can understand.\n\n1:31:24.740 --> 1:31:28.100\n Do you think that it should be as easy\n\n1:31:28.100 --> 1:31:30.820\n for any person in Africa, for any entrepreneur in Africa\n\n1:31:30.820 --> 1:31:35.020\n to enterprise than it is for any person in Scandinavia\n\n1:31:35.020 --> 1:31:36.100\n to enterprise?\n\n1:31:36.100 --> 1:31:38.940\n If your answer is yes, which I would hope it is,\n\n1:31:38.940 --> 1:31:42.860\n then you have a moral obligation to work with me\n\n1:31:42.860 --> 1:31:47.060\n to make my country, and as a whole, my continent,\n\n1:31:47.060 --> 1:31:48.260\n more free markets.\n\n1:31:48.260 --> 1:31:49.180\n It's that simple.\n\n1:31:49.180 --> 1:31:51.180\n At that point, there's no like, yes,\n\n1:31:51.180 --> 1:31:53.540\n but on the other hand, uh uh, no.\n\n1:31:53.540 --> 1:31:54.580\n And for me, on that question,\n\n1:31:54.580 --> 1:31:57.020\n and I yet have to find somebody who claims to say no.\n\n1:31:57.020 --> 1:31:59.220\n If you say no, then we have a whole nother problem\n\n1:31:59.220 --> 1:32:01.260\n that I'm not even talking to at that point anymore.\n\n1:32:01.260 --> 1:32:02.100\n So yeah.\n\n1:32:02.100 --> 1:32:06.860\n So just to clarify, there's a perception in some reality\n\n1:32:06.860 --> 1:32:10.220\n that the Scandinavian countries have elements of socialism\n\n1:32:10.220 --> 1:32:12.260\n in their politics, in their society,\n\n1:32:12.260 --> 1:32:14.340\n even in their economics.\n\n1:32:14.340 --> 1:32:18.620\n So at the very least, Africa should have,\n\n1:32:18.620 --> 1:32:23.140\n in terms of economic indices, should be as free\n\n1:32:23.140 --> 1:32:24.700\n as the Scandinavian countries.\n\n1:32:24.700 --> 1:32:25.540\n You're just giving that example.\n\n1:32:25.540 --> 1:32:27.100\n As economically free, yes.\n\n1:32:27.100 --> 1:32:29.740\n Because see, the Scandinavian, they do have\n\n1:32:32.140 --> 1:32:34.540\n a subsidized, you know, like a welfare system,\n\n1:32:34.540 --> 1:32:37.620\n that's what, a more socialized welfare system,\n\n1:32:37.620 --> 1:32:39.220\n but the way they make their money\n\n1:32:39.220 --> 1:32:41.420\n is very much the way of the free markets.\n\n1:32:41.420 --> 1:32:43.220\n So there is how you make your money,\n\n1:32:43.220 --> 1:32:44.700\n and then there's how you maybe decide\n\n1:32:44.700 --> 1:32:49.060\n as a country to redistribute it, right?\n\n1:32:49.060 --> 1:32:54.060\n And so even there, even in Scandinavia,\n\n1:32:54.220 --> 1:32:56.540\n again, yes, they have more economic freedom.\n\n1:32:56.540 --> 1:33:00.820\n So then from there, Lex, where we go is my job\n\n1:33:00.820 --> 1:33:05.820\n and my goal is for every single African, young and old,\n\n1:33:08.500 --> 1:33:12.140\n to know what I have come to learn.\n\n1:33:13.060 --> 1:33:14.260\n We are not doomed.\n\n1:33:16.980 --> 1:33:18.620\n It's not over for us.\n\n1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:21.220\n We will never catch up.\n\n1:33:21.220 --> 1:33:24.740\n The time for catch up is gone, but guess what?\n\n1:33:24.740 --> 1:33:27.580\n We've got a strong, strong possibility\n\n1:33:27.580 --> 1:33:32.180\n and chance to leapfrog, and leapfrog we will.\n\n1:33:33.100 --> 1:33:35.660\n It is still time, but for that to happen,\n\n1:33:35.660 --> 1:33:36.980\n like I said, we need to know\n\n1:33:36.980 --> 1:33:38.140\n what we just talked about today\n\n1:33:38.140 --> 1:33:40.460\n because that is not what the mainstream\n\n1:33:40.460 --> 1:33:41.860\n keeps us abreast with.\n\n1:33:41.860 --> 1:33:43.780\n When you go to the World Bank,\n\n1:33:43.780 --> 1:33:46.420\n they don't necessarily work along these lines.\n\n1:33:46.420 --> 1:33:51.260\n They're still, it's not, when you go to universities,\n\n1:33:51.260 --> 1:33:54.540\n I will ask you, MIT, the MIT Econ Department,\n\n1:33:54.540 --> 1:33:57.020\n or even some, most of the professors,\n\n1:33:57.020 --> 1:33:58.260\n are they free market oriented?\n\n1:33:58.260 --> 1:34:01.100\n We find that oftentimes in academia,\n\n1:34:01.100 --> 1:34:03.860\n there is a strong anti capitalist bias.\n\n1:34:03.860 --> 1:34:06.940\n There is a strong anti free market bias.\n\n1:34:06.940 --> 1:34:08.860\n So this is a problem.\n\n1:34:08.860 --> 1:34:09.820\n This is a problem.\n\n1:34:09.820 --> 1:34:11.860\n Nobody cares about the economists anyway.\n\n1:34:11.860 --> 1:34:14.380\n Yeah, so we move forward.\n\n1:34:14.380 --> 1:34:18.860\n In MIT, the spirit of the entrepreneur burns bright,\n\n1:34:18.860 --> 1:34:20.980\n not in the economics department\n\n1:34:20.980 --> 1:34:23.940\n because they just write op ed articles,\n\n1:34:23.940 --> 1:34:26.380\n but in the dreamers, the young undergrads\n\n1:34:26.380 --> 1:34:27.980\n that actually build something.\n\n1:34:27.980 --> 1:34:28.820\n No, I get that.\n\n1:34:28.820 --> 1:34:32.420\n But then we cannot be stifling their efforts\n\n1:34:32.420 --> 1:34:37.340\n by putting these artificially made regulations and laws\n\n1:34:37.340 --> 1:34:39.180\n that stand in the way and clip their wings.\n\n1:34:39.180 --> 1:34:41.060\n So that's why when you were saying,\n\n1:34:41.060 --> 1:34:43.180\n what advice do you give to them?\n\n1:34:43.180 --> 1:34:47.140\n The advice I give to them is each one of them,\n\n1:34:47.140 --> 1:34:51.540\n they have to pay attention to this discourse we just had.\n\n1:34:51.540 --> 1:34:55.420\n I don't ask anybody to agree with me on face value.\n\n1:34:55.420 --> 1:34:57.140\n Go back, do like I had to do.\n\n1:34:57.140 --> 1:34:58.620\n I come very much from the left of the left,\n\n1:34:58.620 --> 1:34:59.900\n if you can believe that.\n\n1:34:59.900 --> 1:35:02.380\n But I had to have my own intellectual journey.\n\n1:35:02.380 --> 1:35:04.260\n And in this case, my intellectual journey\n\n1:35:04.260 --> 1:35:08.100\n was very much complimented by my own life.\n\n1:35:08.100 --> 1:35:12.620\n Having to build these companies on two separate continents\n\n1:35:12.620 --> 1:35:17.180\n and having to, I had front row seat of the differences.\n\n1:35:17.180 --> 1:35:20.100\n At first, I thought it was this way just because we're poor\n\n1:35:20.100 --> 1:35:22.700\n and therefore we must stop and therefore it's like this.\n\n1:35:22.700 --> 1:35:24.380\n But eventually I learned that no,\n\n1:35:24.380 --> 1:35:26.300\n we're poor because we lack academic freedom.\n\n1:35:26.300 --> 1:35:28.100\n And if a country allows its citizens\n\n1:35:28.100 --> 1:35:31.500\n the academic freedom to enterprise, then they become rich.\n\n1:35:31.500 --> 1:35:33.540\n So yeah, I had it upside down, you see.\n\n1:35:33.540 --> 1:35:35.380\n And so it's important for people to know that.\n\n1:35:35.380 --> 1:35:38.260\n So number one, know your facts\n\n1:35:38.260 --> 1:35:41.740\n because your facts will empower you.\n\n1:35:41.740 --> 1:35:43.580\n In this case, I like to use that word,\n\n1:35:43.580 --> 1:35:46.140\n facts will empower you and they will even furthermore,\n\n1:35:46.140 --> 1:35:49.260\n they will power you, empower and power you.\n\n1:35:49.260 --> 1:35:50.740\n Because empower is like inside\n\n1:35:50.740 --> 1:35:53.780\n and power is like I push you forward and up.\n\n1:35:53.780 --> 1:35:56.860\n So that's what it does to know the facts.\n\n1:35:56.860 --> 1:36:00.380\n And then go on and look around you.\n\n1:36:00.380 --> 1:36:02.540\n Where are the best practices of this?\n\n1:36:02.540 --> 1:36:05.780\n Who is at the cutting edge of a free markets?\n\n1:36:05.780 --> 1:36:07.340\n Where it's done in a way there,\n\n1:36:08.460 --> 1:36:10.420\n people don't necessarily be left behind\n\n1:36:10.420 --> 1:36:11.500\n or anything like that.\n\n1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:13.740\n We're in 2022 for Christ's sake.\n\n1:36:13.740 --> 1:36:15.860\n We don't have to do entrepreneurship\n\n1:36:15.860 --> 1:36:17.860\n the same way maybe it was done 50 years ago,\n\n1:36:17.860 --> 1:36:20.340\n 100 years ago when as a community, as a people,\n\n1:36:20.340 --> 1:36:23.220\n we were maybe less enlightened because of our times, right?\n\n1:36:23.220 --> 1:36:26.380\n We can update this thing and move forward,\n\n1:36:26.380 --> 1:36:29.580\n but update is definitely not build back,\n\n1:36:29.580 --> 1:36:30.420\n what do they call it?\n\n1:36:30.420 --> 1:36:33.420\n Build back new or whatever they're calling it at the WF,\n\n1:36:33.420 --> 1:36:36.620\n whatever nonsense and stuff they're smoking over there.\n\n1:36:36.620 --> 1:36:37.460\n It's not that.\n\n1:36:37.460 --> 1:36:39.700\n There are some principles that are universal\n\n1:36:39.700 --> 1:36:41.900\n and that stand the test of time.\n\n1:36:41.900 --> 1:36:46.900\n Those we have to keep and on top add the new things\n\n1:36:46.900 --> 1:36:49.380\n we learned from our times and from life.\n\n1:36:49.380 --> 1:36:51.460\n So that's what I want them to know.\n\n1:36:51.460 --> 1:36:54.780\n Learn your facts, be empowered and powered,\n\n1:36:54.780 --> 1:36:57.060\n and then look around, think about it\n\n1:36:57.060 --> 1:37:00.420\n and look to see where the best practices are\n\n1:37:00.420 --> 1:37:02.500\n around the world because the world is yours.\n\n1:37:02.500 --> 1:37:04.620\n You might be African, but the world is yours.\n\n1:37:04.620 --> 1:37:06.860\n So stop this nonsense of, oh, well,\n\n1:37:06.860 --> 1:37:09.060\n it's done by white people, so we're not gonna do it.\n\n1:37:09.060 --> 1:37:12.860\n Get the best that exists in humanity\n\n1:37:12.860 --> 1:37:15.020\n for what you're trying to solve.\n\n1:37:15.020 --> 1:37:19.060\n And on top of that, put your own twist, right?\n\n1:37:19.060 --> 1:37:22.340\n Bitcoin is all of ours to take.\n\n1:37:22.340 --> 1:37:24.060\n Bitcoin is not the white man's thing,\n\n1:37:24.060 --> 1:37:25.380\n so therefore, oh, come on, you know,\n\n1:37:25.380 --> 1:37:27.100\n because we have a misguided pride,\n\n1:37:27.100 --> 1:37:29.180\n we're not gonna use Bitcoin because it's white man's time.\n\n1:37:29.180 --> 1:37:30.860\n Bitcoin is math, you idiot.\n\n1:37:30.860 --> 1:37:34.140\n Math is universal, so it belongs to all of us.\n\n1:37:34.140 --> 1:37:35.100\n There's no color.\n\n1:37:35.100 --> 1:37:35.940\n Exactly.\n\n1:37:35.940 --> 1:37:40.580\n In the space of economics, in the space of ideas.\n\n1:37:40.580 --> 1:37:43.180\n And there's a chance to leapfrog too,\n\n1:37:43.180 --> 1:37:44.740\n which is really, really powerful.\n\n1:37:44.740 --> 1:37:47.540\n Exactly, because here we will leapfrog,\n\n1:37:47.540 --> 1:37:50.700\n and let's, I'm not crazy, this is gonna happen.\n\n1:37:50.700 --> 1:37:53.540\n You mark my words, but it's gonna happen\n\n1:37:53.540 --> 1:37:56.660\n if as many people hear what we're talking about today,\n\n1:37:56.660 --> 1:38:00.140\n because at some point, the solution is not gonna come.\n\n1:38:00.140 --> 1:38:02.740\n It's not me, it's not,\n\n1:38:02.740 --> 1:38:04.660\n it's gonna come from the wisdom of a crowd.\n\n1:38:04.660 --> 1:38:06.860\n This is why I love the crowd.\n\n1:38:06.860 --> 1:38:08.500\n There's no better wisdom than the crowd,\n\n1:38:08.500 --> 1:38:10.500\n and that's also why I believe in the free markets.\n\n1:38:10.500 --> 1:38:13.660\n This concept of emergent order, there's no way,\n\n1:38:13.660 --> 1:38:16.460\n there's no central planning that is smart enough,\n\n1:38:16.460 --> 1:38:20.380\n that has the level of intel that street level people have,\n\n1:38:21.540 --> 1:38:22.820\n trying to create something.\n\n1:38:22.820 --> 1:38:24.620\n It's just, we just have to be humble.\n\n1:38:24.620 --> 1:38:27.420\n There's just something at the bottom of a pyramid\n\n1:38:27.420 --> 1:38:29.660\n that just bubbles up and happens.\n\n1:38:29.660 --> 1:38:31.300\n They're the best.\n\n1:38:31.300 --> 1:38:34.540\n I think the cynicism, the idea that people are dumb\n\n1:38:34.540 --> 1:38:37.820\n is at the core of a lot of things\n\n1:38:37.820 --> 1:38:41.060\n that prevent the flourishing of society.\n\n1:38:41.060 --> 1:38:42.340\n You know, this kind of anecdotally,\n\n1:38:42.340 --> 1:38:44.260\n people are like, ah, everyone is stupid,\n\n1:38:44.260 --> 1:38:45.940\n and people say that jokingly.\n\n1:38:45.940 --> 1:38:49.540\n But the reality is, people are incredible.\n\n1:38:49.540 --> 1:38:53.140\n They have the capacity for kindness, for love,\n\n1:38:53.140 --> 1:38:57.500\n for innovation, for brilliance, in all kinds of dimensions.\n\n1:38:57.500 --> 1:38:59.620\n You might suck at math,\n\n1:38:59.620 --> 1:39:02.060\n but you might be amazing at carpentry.\n\n1:39:02.060 --> 1:39:03.500\n You have to find that thing,\n\n1:39:03.500 --> 1:39:05.380\n and there's something about,\n\n1:39:05.380 --> 1:39:07.300\n when there's a freedom to find that thing,\n\n1:39:07.300 --> 1:39:10.020\n and people interact, they get excited about shit together,\n\n1:39:10.020 --> 1:39:11.980\n and then they build.\n\n1:39:11.980 --> 1:39:14.740\n If you look at authoritarian,\n\n1:39:14.740 --> 1:39:18.540\n at places that limit that freedom,\n\n1:39:18.540 --> 1:39:22.340\n at the core, I think, is the idea that people are dumb.\n\n1:39:22.340 --> 1:39:24.140\n Let us take care of everything.\n\n1:39:24.140 --> 1:39:26.260\n We'll come up with the rules and the regulations,\n\n1:39:26.260 --> 1:39:28.940\n because people are too dumb to manage things themselves.\n\n1:39:28.940 --> 1:39:33.020\n And then that idea builds on top of itself,\n\n1:39:33.020 --> 1:39:35.820\n where you think that the entire populace\n\n1:39:35.820 --> 1:39:39.620\n is much lesser than the wise sages sitting at the top.\n\n1:39:39.620 --> 1:39:41.220\n Then you add violence on top of that,\n\n1:39:41.220 --> 1:39:43.620\n and that leads to corruption,\n\n1:39:43.620 --> 1:39:46.340\n to corrupting of just the human mind of the leaders,\n\n1:39:46.340 --> 1:39:49.780\n and the whole thing becomes a giant mess.\n\n1:39:49.780 --> 1:39:54.500\n The antidote to that is economic freedom.\n\n1:39:54.500 --> 1:39:56.420\n For people to have a freedom to enterprise.\n\n1:39:56.420 --> 1:40:01.420\n And look, Lex, when we allow for that to happen,\n\n1:40:01.540 --> 1:40:02.780\n have you looked around lately\n\n1:40:02.780 --> 1:40:06.020\n and looked at the level of niche\n\n1:40:06.020 --> 1:40:08.020\n that has happened in this country?\n\n1:40:08.020 --> 1:40:11.380\n I mean, you have clubs where, you have places\n\n1:40:11.380 --> 1:40:13.100\n where people are into guitar strings,\n\n1:40:13.100 --> 1:40:14.140\n you know, like some of the,\n\n1:40:14.140 --> 1:40:16.780\n like it's all about guitar strings.\n\n1:40:16.780 --> 1:40:19.780\n And others, it's all about these best cupcakes.\n\n1:40:19.780 --> 1:40:23.500\n And others, it's all about this new crypto thing over here.\n\n1:40:23.500 --> 1:40:27.980\n And others, like hair, best, you know, weight.\n\n1:40:27.980 --> 1:40:32.980\n It's, when you allow us, because seven billion geniuses,\n\n1:40:34.060 --> 1:40:35.380\n each one of us, I believe,\n\n1:40:35.380 --> 1:40:38.260\n came to this world with something,\n\n1:40:38.260 --> 1:40:41.580\n something that only he or her possesses.\n\n1:40:41.580 --> 1:40:43.060\n And that is the genius,\n\n1:40:43.060 --> 1:40:47.340\n and it is their contribution to the human problem.\n\n1:40:47.340 --> 1:40:49.460\n When you think about your identity today,\n\n1:40:49.460 --> 1:40:52.020\n so it all started in Africa,\n\n1:40:52.020 --> 1:40:55.260\n just like it did for the entirety of the human species.\n\n1:40:55.260 --> 1:40:57.100\n There's a bit of European flavor in there,\n\n1:40:57.100 --> 1:41:00.900\n a little French, Silicon Valley.\n\n1:41:00.900 --> 1:41:05.100\n You're now, in part, a Texan.\n\n1:41:05.100 --> 1:41:08.460\n There's, you really are an American,\n\n1:41:08.460 --> 1:41:10.420\n but you're also an African.\n\n1:41:11.540 --> 1:41:13.740\n Who are you, when you look in the mirror,\n\n1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:15.020\n when you think about yourself,\n\n1:41:15.020 --> 1:41:17.540\n when you listen, when everything gets quiet\n\n1:41:17.540 --> 1:41:20.420\n and you listen to your heart, who are you?\n\n1:41:20.420 --> 1:41:22.980\n Can you figure out that puzzle?\n\n1:41:23.860 --> 1:41:25.140\n That's a very interesting question,\n\n1:41:25.140 --> 1:41:30.140\n because it's been a long time I haven't asked myself.\n\n1:41:30.140 --> 1:41:35.140\n I have before.\n\n1:41:42.700 --> 1:41:44.340\n What I have found is,\n\n1:41:47.460 --> 1:41:50.980\n I think who I am today has been, for sure,\n\n1:41:50.980 --> 1:41:54.980\n shaped by, I call it Dakar, Paris, San Francisco.\n\n1:41:54.980 --> 1:41:59.020\n Dakar is Senegal, Paris, France,\n\n1:41:59.020 --> 1:42:01.020\n and San Francisco, primarily.\n\n1:42:01.020 --> 1:42:02.700\n And now, yeah, I think I might want to ask,\n\n1:42:02.700 --> 1:42:04.660\n there's a little bit of Texan in there.\n\n1:42:04.660 --> 1:42:07.060\n How do you say Texas in French?\n\n1:42:07.060 --> 1:42:07.900\n Texas.\n\n1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:08.740\n Texas.\n\n1:42:08.740 --> 1:42:09.580\n Texas.\n\n1:42:09.580 --> 1:42:10.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:10.420 --> 1:42:11.620\n Austin, Texas.\n\n1:42:11.620 --> 1:42:12.540\n Austin, Texas.\n\n1:42:12.540 --> 1:42:13.380\n Austin.\n\n1:42:13.380 --> 1:42:14.220\n Austin, Texas.\n\n1:42:14.220 --> 1:42:15.540\n It's easy.\n\n1:42:15.540 --> 1:42:16.620\n Not quite as good as San Francisco.\n\n1:42:16.620 --> 1:42:17.740\n Austin, Texas.\n\n1:42:17.740 --> 1:42:18.700\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:42:18.700 --> 1:42:19.820\n Us, Texas.\n\n1:42:19.820 --> 1:42:20.660\n Us.\n\n1:42:20.660 --> 1:42:22.140\n Texas, yeah.\n\n1:42:22.140 --> 1:42:22.980\n So,\n\n1:42:22.980 --> 1:42:27.980\n you, I was formed by those three.\n\n1:42:30.260 --> 1:42:35.260\n I have to say that what I enjoy from my Senegalese roots\n\n1:42:35.500 --> 1:42:40.500\n are our commitment to peace, love, and tolerance very much.\n\n1:42:44.780 --> 1:42:46.300\n And Taranga, obviously.\n\n1:42:48.220 --> 1:42:50.500\n And I like that it's a culture\n\n1:42:50.500 --> 1:42:53.300\n that's very much about reverence.\n\n1:42:53.300 --> 1:42:54.740\n It's, we're big on reverence.\n\n1:42:56.420 --> 1:43:00.700\n I don't think you could ever hear me tell an older person,\n\n1:43:00.700 --> 1:43:04.260\n especially not my parents or my grandma or anybody like that,\n\n1:43:04.260 --> 1:43:08.540\n for us to be able to tell an older person that's not true\n\n1:43:08.540 --> 1:43:11.500\n or you're lying would never cross my mind\n\n1:43:11.500 --> 1:43:12.900\n because that's the most disrespectful thing\n\n1:43:12.900 --> 1:43:13.740\n you can think of,\n\n1:43:13.740 --> 1:43:15.780\n the most irreverent thing you can think of.\n\n1:43:15.780 --> 1:43:17.100\n It doesn't mean that you have to agree\n\n1:43:17.100 --> 1:43:19.260\n with everything that's said,\n\n1:43:19.260 --> 1:43:21.860\n but there is a way to disagree.\n\n1:43:21.860 --> 1:43:23.420\n There is a way to push back\n\n1:43:23.420 --> 1:43:25.700\n that doesn't have to rob this person\n\n1:43:25.700 --> 1:43:26.940\n who happens to be older than you,\n\n1:43:26.940 --> 1:43:31.940\n especially from the dignity that older age normally provides.\n\n1:43:31.980 --> 1:43:33.740\n And there's wisdom to their words\n\n1:43:33.740 --> 1:43:36.300\n that you yourself may not see.\n\n1:43:36.300 --> 1:43:40.340\n So the reverence is for the idea of wisdom, of tradition.\n\n1:43:40.340 --> 1:43:42.580\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n1:43:42.580 --> 1:43:46.980\n And again, so that is something that I really enjoy,\n\n1:43:46.980 --> 1:43:49.060\n especially, and something I'm very attached to,\n\n1:43:49.060 --> 1:43:52.900\n to this day, and then from France,\n\n1:43:52.900 --> 1:43:56.580\n what I really came to enjoy, of course,\n\n1:43:56.580 --> 1:44:00.300\n is all the fineness that one can find\n\n1:44:00.300 --> 1:44:02.100\n within French culture.\n\n1:44:02.100 --> 1:44:03.340\n The fineness?\n\n1:44:03.340 --> 1:44:04.380\n Yeah, the fineness.\n\n1:44:04.380 --> 1:44:05.700\n Foods.\n\n1:44:05.700 --> 1:44:08.740\n You mean like the intricacies, like the very...\n\n1:44:08.740 --> 1:44:11.620\n Yeah, the soft sophistication in there.\n\n1:44:11.620 --> 1:44:14.100\n I mean, French lingerie, for example.\n\n1:44:14.100 --> 1:44:18.060\n I mean, la dentelle, the laces, all of that,\n\n1:44:18.060 --> 1:44:22.580\n it's super, it's exquisite.\n\n1:44:22.580 --> 1:44:23.540\n So the...\n\n1:44:23.540 --> 1:44:24.380\n The fashion, the food.\n\n1:44:24.380 --> 1:44:26.020\n The fashion, the food.\n\n1:44:26.020 --> 1:44:27.500\n I mean, there's something to be said about all of that,\n\n1:44:27.500 --> 1:44:29.460\n and it's very beautiful.\n\n1:44:29.460 --> 1:44:32.660\n And I love also, even when I talk about fineness,\n\n1:44:32.660 --> 1:44:34.740\n it's like a meal is not about this big thing\n\n1:44:34.740 --> 1:44:36.020\n they put in front of you,\n\n1:44:36.020 --> 1:44:39.180\n but smaller portions, enjoy what you're eating\n\n1:44:39.180 --> 1:44:40.220\n and spend time at a table.\n\n1:44:40.220 --> 1:44:42.380\n Like the eating time is not necessarily\n\n1:44:42.380 --> 1:44:44.260\n just this function of feeding yourself,\n\n1:44:44.260 --> 1:44:46.460\n which I understand it,\n\n1:44:46.460 --> 1:44:49.540\n but this is something that they share\n\n1:44:49.540 --> 1:44:51.540\n with Senegalese culture,\n\n1:44:51.540 --> 1:44:55.180\n is eating is a moment of communion.\n\n1:44:55.180 --> 1:44:57.940\n It's a moment of friendship, family.\n\n1:44:57.940 --> 1:45:00.580\n It's a precious moment.\n\n1:45:00.580 --> 1:45:03.780\n To this day, and my husband is American,\n\n1:45:03.780 --> 1:45:07.220\n we eat our meals together all the time.\n\n1:45:07.220 --> 1:45:09.100\n I would not have it any other way.\n\n1:45:09.100 --> 1:45:11.100\n And there's a prep time, all of that stuff.\n\n1:45:11.100 --> 1:45:13.820\n It doesn't matter how busy I am, but we're doing it.\n\n1:45:13.820 --> 1:45:15.500\n Actually, to push back a little bit,\n\n1:45:15.500 --> 1:45:16.460\n it's interesting, because yeah,\n\n1:45:16.460 --> 1:45:20.140\n the camaraderie over a meal is a beautiful thing.\n\n1:45:20.140 --> 1:45:22.940\n I got, I mean, I was in a pretty dark place\n\n1:45:22.940 --> 1:45:24.260\n because on the way to Ukraine,\n\n1:45:24.260 --> 1:45:26.300\n I traveled to Paris, I stayed in Paris,\n\n1:45:26.300 --> 1:45:30.500\n and I wasn't able to enjoy the fineness\n\n1:45:31.740 --> 1:45:33.620\n because it was almost a distraction\n\n1:45:33.620 --> 1:45:36.340\n from the humanity for some reason to me,\n\n1:45:36.340 --> 1:45:39.140\n because there's such a focus on the art of it all\n\n1:45:40.020 --> 1:45:42.540\n that you lose the basic connection to humanity.\n\n1:45:42.540 --> 1:45:44.260\n Now, that said.\n\n1:45:44.260 --> 1:45:45.620\n Depends what you're talking about.\n\n1:45:45.620 --> 1:45:48.700\n I think some of the lack of connection over humanity\n\n1:45:48.700 --> 1:45:51.700\n was the fact that while I did know how to speak French\n\n1:45:51.700 --> 1:45:54.380\n for a long time, I forgot most of the language.\n\n1:45:55.260 --> 1:45:58.100\n And so part of it, there is a barrier.\n\n1:45:58.100 --> 1:45:59.540\n You said hospitality.\n\n1:46:00.540 --> 1:46:03.340\n There is a bit of a barrier in French culture\n\n1:46:03.340 --> 1:46:05.900\n to where in order to be welcomed in,\n\n1:46:05.900 --> 1:46:09.380\n you have to hear the music\n\n1:46:09.380 --> 1:46:12.220\n and be able to play the music of the people.\n\n1:46:12.220 --> 1:46:16.380\n And if you don't, there's a bit of a barrier.\n\n1:46:16.380 --> 1:46:18.940\n I must admit on that end that it is true.\n\n1:46:19.780 --> 1:46:21.580\n You would feel less that\n\n1:46:21.580 --> 1:46:24.060\n if you were with a group of Senegalese people per se,\n\n1:46:24.060 --> 1:46:27.460\n or I would even say if a group of Spanish people.\n\n1:46:28.380 --> 1:46:31.060\n And I think this is maybe the other side\n\n1:46:31.060 --> 1:46:32.580\n of it for the French people.\n\n1:46:32.580 --> 1:46:35.140\n They can be a little bit uppity up there.\n\n1:46:35.140 --> 1:46:38.340\n And I think maybe that's what you're sensing there.\n\n1:46:38.340 --> 1:46:40.260\n If you don't have the codes,\n\n1:46:40.260 --> 1:46:42.860\n which is what you call if you don't sing the music,\n\n1:46:42.860 --> 1:46:45.420\n then it's hard for you to be part of it.\n\n1:46:45.420 --> 1:46:48.580\n But I was speaking here from the standpoint of your inn.\n\n1:46:48.580 --> 1:46:51.020\n Yeah, from the inside.\n\n1:46:51.020 --> 1:46:54.940\n Also, come on, coming from Texas and also Ukraine,\n\n1:46:54.940 --> 1:46:58.500\n Ukraine, I should say some of the best steak and meat\n\n1:46:58.500 --> 1:47:00.580\n I've ever had, cheap.\n\n1:47:01.660 --> 1:47:03.140\n Texas, some of the greatest.\n\n1:47:03.140 --> 1:47:06.940\n And the size of the meals in France,\n\n1:47:06.940 --> 1:47:08.500\n it's like, what are we doing here?\n\n1:47:08.500 --> 1:47:11.820\n I mean, I get it's art.\n\n1:47:11.820 --> 1:47:14.580\n I'd like to look at my art on the wall\n\n1:47:14.580 --> 1:47:16.540\n and then eat my damn steak.\n\n1:47:16.540 --> 1:47:17.380\n I just wanna cut the shit.\n\n1:47:17.380 --> 1:47:18.980\n Did you go, so maybe, okay, no, no, no, no.\n\n1:47:18.980 --> 1:47:20.300\n Okay, now here I have to defend them,\n\n1:47:20.300 --> 1:47:22.060\n although sometimes I'm the worst.\n\n1:47:22.060 --> 1:47:25.420\n Now, did you go to some Michelin star restaurant?\n\n1:47:25.420 --> 1:47:26.260\n Maybe that's why.\n\n1:47:26.260 --> 1:47:27.100\n Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.\n\n1:47:27.100 --> 1:47:29.580\n That's why, because next time you go to France,\n\n1:47:29.580 --> 1:47:34.580\n I'll take you to the countryside or any French home.\n\n1:47:35.740 --> 1:47:38.020\n They will serve you multiple times.\n\n1:47:38.020 --> 1:47:41.260\n I mean, by the time you're done,\n\n1:47:41.260 --> 1:47:43.220\n even if the portions are smaller,\n\n1:47:43.220 --> 1:47:44.060\n they're smaller if you want to,\n\n1:47:44.060 --> 1:47:45.860\n but because that way you get a chance\n\n1:47:45.860 --> 1:47:48.620\n to really feel what you're eating and then have more\n\n1:47:48.620 --> 1:47:50.620\n and then all of that stuff, but not be like, ah, like this.\n\n1:47:50.620 --> 1:47:52.900\n And then, but no, you'll eat plenty,\n\n1:47:52.900 --> 1:47:54.980\n but it's because you went to the Michelin places\n\n1:47:54.980 --> 1:47:55.820\n where they were like.\n\n1:47:55.820 --> 1:47:58.100\n I'm sure the warmth of the people is there.\n\n1:47:58.100 --> 1:48:00.580\n It almost makes me sad that sometimes,\n\n1:48:00.580 --> 1:48:02.460\n I think to properly be in a place,\n\n1:48:02.460 --> 1:48:05.060\n you really should spend a long time there.\n\n1:48:05.060 --> 1:48:06.620\n And also be emotionally ready.\n\n1:48:06.620 --> 1:48:09.340\n Again, I was emotionally unavailable.\n\n1:48:09.340 --> 1:48:10.180\n I was just like.\n\n1:48:10.180 --> 1:48:11.380\n Well, I would imagine on the way to the Ukraine,\n\n1:48:11.380 --> 1:48:13.180\n I'm like, who can think about food?\n\n1:48:13.180 --> 1:48:16.180\n But in your identity, a bit of Texas,\n\n1:48:16.180 --> 1:48:18.860\n a bit of San Francisco, a bit of Africa.\n\n1:48:18.860 --> 1:48:20.540\n Yeah, San Francisco.\n\n1:48:20.540 --> 1:48:23.620\n And I guess from the America,\n\n1:48:23.620 --> 1:48:27.980\n the defining thing for me for America is,\n\n1:48:27.980 --> 1:48:32.980\n it's the freedom and the entrepreneurial mindset.\n\n1:48:33.100 --> 1:48:35.860\n See, very quickly when I moved from France\n\n1:48:35.860 --> 1:48:37.420\n to the United States,\n\n1:48:37.420 --> 1:48:40.540\n and I started becoming successful in the United States,\n\n1:48:40.540 --> 1:48:42.460\n I found myself, me and my husband,\n\n1:48:42.460 --> 1:48:45.860\n he was French and my first husband who passed away.\n\n1:48:45.860 --> 1:48:47.180\n We found ourselves at some point,\n\n1:48:47.180 --> 1:48:50.500\n we stopped talking to our friends in France\n\n1:48:50.500 --> 1:48:52.260\n who stayed in France,\n\n1:48:53.420 --> 1:48:55.820\n because we were talking to them about things\n\n1:48:55.820 --> 1:49:00.340\n that were so outside of their comprehension.\n\n1:49:00.340 --> 1:49:04.260\n What do you mean you're in your twenties\n\n1:49:04.260 --> 1:49:09.260\n and you just raised, I don't know,\n\n1:49:09.260 --> 1:49:10.700\n a million dollars or $2 million,\n\n1:49:10.700 --> 1:49:11.860\n especially from back in those days.\n\n1:49:11.860 --> 1:49:13.500\n Today, it's easy here and there.\n\n1:49:13.500 --> 1:49:14.540\n So even in France,\n\n1:49:14.540 --> 1:49:16.740\n that entrepreneurial spirit didn't burn quite as bright.\n\n1:49:16.740 --> 1:49:19.540\n I mean, don't take me wrong.\n\n1:49:19.540 --> 1:49:21.500\n Do you have some entrepreneurial people in France?\n\n1:49:21.500 --> 1:49:23.820\n Yeah, but to the level that you have it in the US,\n\n1:49:23.820 --> 1:49:24.940\n absolutely not.\n\n1:49:24.940 --> 1:49:28.060\n It's just, I mean, in France, it's still very much,\n\n1:49:28.060 --> 1:49:29.540\n you're born in this area,\n\n1:49:29.540 --> 1:49:30.980\n you go to school in that area,\n\n1:49:30.980 --> 1:49:32.220\n your parents live around,\n\n1:49:32.220 --> 1:49:35.020\n eventually you'll marry and be where your parents are\n\n1:49:35.020 --> 1:49:38.220\n or maybe go to where your spouse's parents are\n\n1:49:38.220 --> 1:49:40.660\n and you buy your house and you buy it once\n\n1:49:40.660 --> 1:49:42.580\n and you're not gonna do like the Americans,\n\n1:49:42.580 --> 1:49:44.700\n two years later, I sell my house, I go somewhere else.\n\n1:49:44.700 --> 1:49:45.940\n You don't have any of anything.\n\n1:49:45.940 --> 1:49:48.940\n What do you mean, just stopping from nowhere,\n\n1:49:48.940 --> 1:49:50.340\n you're gonna do what?\n\n1:49:50.340 --> 1:49:52.620\n Start a business and you have nothing to back you up\n\n1:49:52.620 --> 1:49:53.460\n or whatever.\n\n1:49:53.460 --> 1:49:57.740\n Oh, and even this idea of going and fundraising,\n\n1:49:57.740 --> 1:49:59.700\n this venture cap, especially back in the days,\n\n1:49:59.700 --> 1:50:02.020\n venture cap, all of that, it's very American.\n\n1:50:02.020 --> 1:50:03.540\n We take it for granted, but it's very American.\n\n1:50:03.540 --> 1:50:06.420\n Who would have made a bet on me in France?\n\n1:50:06.420 --> 1:50:07.620\n The same person.\n\n1:50:07.620 --> 1:50:09.460\n I would not have found the same people.\n\n1:50:09.460 --> 1:50:13.740\n I would never in France have been able to raise,\n\n1:50:13.740 --> 1:50:16.020\n at some point it was $32 million for my first business,\n\n1:50:16.020 --> 1:50:18.420\n never would have been able to do that in France.\n\n1:50:18.420 --> 1:50:19.900\n And it doesn't mean that French people are bad people\n\n1:50:19.900 --> 1:50:20.740\n or anything like that.\n\n1:50:20.740 --> 1:50:24.540\n It's just something that's just not so in the culture.\n\n1:50:24.540 --> 1:50:27.100\n Just like this whole concept of philanthropy,\n\n1:50:27.100 --> 1:50:29.180\n it's not that the French people don't do philanthropy,\n\n1:50:29.180 --> 1:50:31.620\n but philanthropy in America is very different\n\n1:50:31.620 --> 1:50:34.260\n from the level and also the magnitude\n\n1:50:34.260 --> 1:50:35.900\n of maybe what the French people do.\n\n1:50:35.900 --> 1:50:37.940\n And also they have this always like,\n\n1:50:37.940 --> 1:50:39.660\n oh, let's do it behind the scene.\n\n1:50:39.660 --> 1:50:42.420\n Money is suspicious, success is suspicious.\n\n1:50:42.420 --> 1:50:44.500\n So at some point my husband and I just felt like\n\n1:50:44.500 --> 1:50:46.020\n our friends actually were maybe thinking\n\n1:50:46.020 --> 1:50:47.860\n that we're maybe some drug dealers or something.\n\n1:50:47.860 --> 1:50:51.020\n So we just stopped because it just was not flowing anymore.\n\n1:50:51.020 --> 1:50:56.020\n And so yes, in America I found this entrepreneurial spirit,\n\n1:50:56.020 --> 1:50:59.020\n but then I was able to link it with something\n\n1:50:59.020 --> 1:51:01.220\n that I'm very familiar with in my country.\n\n1:51:01.220 --> 1:51:04.700\n See, back home in Senegal, I'm part of this,\n\n1:51:04.700 --> 1:51:07.020\n you have what we call the Mourid, I'm a Mourid.\n\n1:51:07.020 --> 1:51:11.060\n So what it is is one of the four brotherhoods in Senegal,\n\n1:51:11.060 --> 1:51:13.380\n Mouridism is the most influential of them\n\n1:51:13.380 --> 1:51:14.580\n and the biggest one.\n\n1:51:14.580 --> 1:51:17.900\n And us, it's all about entrepreneurship as well.\n\n1:51:17.900 --> 1:51:21.020\n I mean, of course there's the whole religious part,\n\n1:51:21.020 --> 1:51:23.700\n but our mantra is,\n\n1:51:23.700 --> 1:51:26.020\n pray as if you will die tomorrow\n\n1:51:26.020 --> 1:51:28.180\n and work as if you will never die.\n\n1:51:28.180 --> 1:51:29.780\n And the way we say,\n\n1:51:29.780 --> 1:51:32.300\n the way somebody will say that somebody passed away,\n\n1:51:32.300 --> 1:51:34.940\n we say, somebody has retired.\n\n1:51:34.940 --> 1:51:36.940\n Somebody has retired from their work.\n\n1:51:36.940 --> 1:51:37.780\n Right?\n\n1:51:37.780 --> 1:51:38.620\n Beautiful.\n\n1:51:38.620 --> 1:51:39.460\n Right?\n\n1:51:39.460 --> 1:51:44.460\n So, I think it's funny because in that community,\n\n1:51:44.620 --> 1:51:46.860\n we're very much entrepreneurial,\n\n1:51:46.860 --> 1:51:50.220\n left to our own devices, we're entrepreneurial.\n\n1:51:50.220 --> 1:51:52.620\n But then what happens is the minute that we die,\n\n1:51:52.620 --> 1:51:55.500\n then what happens is the minute people start going to,\n\n1:51:55.500 --> 1:51:57.860\n they're being educated through the education system,\n\n1:51:57.860 --> 1:51:59.900\n you know, like the French, especially the system,\n\n1:51:59.900 --> 1:52:01.700\n but tend to breed more like, you know,\n\n1:52:01.700 --> 1:52:03.380\n the French bureaucrat mindset,\n\n1:52:03.380 --> 1:52:05.580\n then you can see all the entrepreneurial mindset\n\n1:52:05.580 --> 1:52:07.940\n kind of starting to dwindle down.\n\n1:52:07.940 --> 1:52:09.460\n So it's kind of very interesting.\n\n1:52:09.460 --> 1:52:13.060\n So in a way, America helped me reunite\n\n1:52:13.060 --> 1:52:15.260\n with that side of my roots,\n\n1:52:15.260 --> 1:52:20.260\n where America tells me, reinforces that side of my roots\n\n1:52:20.260 --> 1:52:22.940\n and also gives me more tools to practice\n\n1:52:22.940 --> 1:52:25.820\n that side of my roots, if that makes any sense.\n\n1:52:25.820 --> 1:52:29.060\n Through all of that, that's what brings out\n\n1:52:29.060 --> 1:52:31.460\n the heart of a cheetah, which I think is a beautiful,\n\n1:52:31.460 --> 1:52:36.460\n beautiful thing that encapsulates that whole trajectory,\n\n1:52:36.580 --> 1:52:38.820\n which I think is the best possible answer\n\n1:52:38.820 --> 1:52:39.780\n anyone could give.\n\n1:52:39.780 --> 1:52:44.180\n It makes me want to really think about who I am,\n\n1:52:44.180 --> 1:52:47.100\n because you really have brought together\n\n1:52:47.100 --> 1:52:49.220\n so many cultures within yourself\n\n1:52:49.220 --> 1:52:52.220\n that just talking to you makes you feel like\n\n1:52:52.220 --> 1:52:54.260\n we are just all one people.\n\n1:52:54.260 --> 1:52:56.660\n Because at the end we are, at the end we are.\n\n1:52:58.220 --> 1:53:00.660\n And, you know, when you come from,\n\n1:53:00.660 --> 1:53:03.420\n at the end we are, and also I think for me,\n\n1:53:03.420 --> 1:53:05.500\n if people can take anything from my story,\n\n1:53:05.500 --> 1:53:07.700\n it's at the end of the day, I am very clear about it.\n\n1:53:07.700 --> 1:53:11.260\n And I'm all for harmony among people\n\n1:53:11.260 --> 1:53:13.820\n and among us peoples.\n\n1:53:13.820 --> 1:53:18.820\n If we can accept that we're all,\n\n1:53:20.020 --> 1:53:23.300\n I know this sounds so cliche, but for me it's so true,\n\n1:53:23.300 --> 1:53:24.860\n that we're all humans.\n\n1:53:24.860 --> 1:53:27.660\n You know, when I left Senegal,\n\n1:53:27.660 --> 1:53:30.060\n when I was about to leave Senegal for the first time\n\n1:53:30.060 --> 1:53:33.340\n and to go to Europe to be reunited with my parents,\n\n1:53:33.340 --> 1:53:35.500\n because now they had emigrated\n\n1:53:35.500 --> 1:53:37.500\n and things were going to be fine.\n\n1:53:37.500 --> 1:53:40.900\n And I was going to be, things were stable for them.\n\n1:53:40.900 --> 1:53:43.780\n Now they're like, it's time to be reunited with her.\n\n1:53:43.780 --> 1:53:46.300\n They brought me over, but before I left Senegal,\n\n1:53:46.300 --> 1:53:47.780\n my grandma sat me down.\n\n1:53:47.780 --> 1:53:50.180\n She actually, she lowered herself down to my level\n\n1:53:50.180 --> 1:53:54.060\n and she said, my god, you're about to go to this place\n\n1:53:54.060 --> 1:53:56.060\n where most people will not look like you.\n\n1:53:57.980 --> 1:53:59.900\n And most people speak a language\n\n1:53:59.900 --> 1:54:02.220\n that's going to be different from yours.\n\n1:54:02.220 --> 1:54:03.580\n And you're going to realize that all the kids\n\n1:54:03.580 --> 1:54:05.740\n are going to school and you've never been to school\n\n1:54:05.740 --> 1:54:07.660\n because, you know, I was, like I said, a free range kid\n\n1:54:07.660 --> 1:54:09.660\n and I was just living my life.\n\n1:54:09.660 --> 1:54:13.700\n And she said, but I don't want for any of that,\n\n1:54:13.700 --> 1:54:14.820\n and she showed her words, she said,\n\n1:54:14.820 --> 1:54:18.420\n I don't want for any of that to intimidate you.\n\n1:54:18.420 --> 1:54:21.340\n She said, you can be impressed by some of it if you want,\n\n1:54:21.340 --> 1:54:23.260\n but no intimidation.\n\n1:54:23.260 --> 1:54:24.980\n And she said, because the fact\n\n1:54:24.980 --> 1:54:26.020\n that they might be different from you,\n\n1:54:26.020 --> 1:54:28.060\n yeah, they're going to have a different skin color from you,\n\n1:54:28.060 --> 1:54:30.940\n but it is still human skin.\n\n1:54:30.940 --> 1:54:32.860\n You're human, they're human.\n\n1:54:32.860 --> 1:54:35.300\n And she said, this language you're going to speak,\n\n1:54:35.300 --> 1:54:37.420\n it's a different language from yours,\n\n1:54:37.420 --> 1:54:41.020\n but it is still a language that humans speak.\n\n1:54:41.020 --> 1:54:42.340\n You're human, they're human.\n\n1:54:42.340 --> 1:54:44.660\n Therefore, you're going to speak it.\n\n1:54:44.660 --> 1:54:47.540\n And lastly, they have gone to school.\n\n1:54:47.540 --> 1:54:49.620\n Going to school is what little humans do.\n\n1:54:49.620 --> 1:54:52.740\n You're a little human, so you'll be just fine.\n\n1:54:52.740 --> 1:54:54.860\n And I went and grandma was right.\n\n1:54:54.860 --> 1:54:56.540\n Right, she was right.\n\n1:54:56.540 --> 1:54:58.500\n And that helped me.\n\n1:54:58.500 --> 1:55:03.220\n And I think when you internalize that so early on,\n\n1:55:05.260 --> 1:55:07.220\n it just makes you belong to the human family\n\n1:55:07.220 --> 1:55:08.220\n that you're part of.\n\n1:55:08.220 --> 1:55:10.260\n I am part of a human family.\n\n1:55:10.260 --> 1:55:12.860\n And I would have no problem going to Russia, for example,\n\n1:55:12.860 --> 1:55:16.260\n let's take, and be totally open.\n\n1:55:16.260 --> 1:55:17.620\n Maybe don't go right now, but.\n\n1:55:17.620 --> 1:55:18.460\n No, not now.\n\n1:55:18.460 --> 1:55:19.460\n Maybe not now, you're right.\n\n1:55:19.460 --> 1:55:20.300\n But what I just.\n\n1:55:20.300 --> 1:55:22.820\n Or at least don't bring weed if you go on the plane.\n\n1:55:22.820 --> 1:55:25.820\n No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, right.\n\n1:55:25.820 --> 1:55:28.500\n That girl, I don't know what she was thinking, but.\n\n1:55:28.500 --> 1:55:30.900\n No, so, but what I'm trying to say, Lex,\n\n1:55:30.900 --> 1:55:34.260\n is I feel like I can go anywhere in the world,\n\n1:55:34.260 --> 1:55:38.380\n including some of the most unfriendly places in the world\n\n1:55:38.380 --> 1:55:41.460\n to someone like me, because there are places like that.\n\n1:55:41.460 --> 1:55:46.460\n And yet I know, I know that somehow, somewhere,\n\n1:55:47.260 --> 1:55:48.860\n someone will take care of me.\n\n1:55:48.860 --> 1:55:50.460\n Someone will help me.\n\n1:55:50.460 --> 1:55:52.100\n When I first came to this country,\n\n1:55:54.980 --> 1:55:59.980\n I came as a tourist, but you had this amazing family\n\n1:56:00.420 --> 1:56:03.940\n who had a business, a family business in Indiana,\n\n1:56:03.940 --> 1:56:08.700\n Columbus, Indiana, the Wences, Carolyn Eldon Wence,\n\n1:56:08.700 --> 1:56:10.700\n I owe them everything that I have in this country,\n\n1:56:10.700 --> 1:56:12.380\n that I am in this country.\n\n1:56:12.380 --> 1:56:17.380\n They are Americans in the mid America\n\n1:56:17.420 --> 1:56:19.340\n from a place that most other Americans\n\n1:56:19.340 --> 1:56:22.020\n would maybe look down on because,\n\n1:56:22.020 --> 1:56:23.620\n and some people would be like, oh, you're going to this place\n\n1:56:23.620 --> 1:56:26.460\n where they have more churches and cows than people,\n\n1:56:26.460 --> 1:56:30.820\n that type of behavior, because the elite coastal elites,\n\n1:56:30.820 --> 1:56:35.820\n but it is in Midwest, in the Midwest that I found,\n\n1:56:35.900 --> 1:56:40.900\n that I, black young women coming out of nowhere,\n\n1:56:41.300 --> 1:56:43.100\n found support.\n\n1:56:43.100 --> 1:56:44.540\n They all rallied around me.\n\n1:56:44.540 --> 1:56:47.420\n I didn't even come from the same faith as they are from,\n\n1:56:47.420 --> 1:56:49.860\n yet their whole church rallied around me\n\n1:56:49.860 --> 1:56:52.580\n to find me an apartment.\n\n1:56:52.580 --> 1:56:55.540\n My host family found me, got me a job,\n\n1:56:55.540 --> 1:56:57.500\n and it was not a pity job.\n\n1:56:57.500 --> 1:56:59.980\n They were like, we need, we are in serious needs\n\n1:56:59.980 --> 1:57:02.260\n of getting our accounting under control\n\n1:57:02.260 --> 1:57:03.460\n and our marketing and all of that.\n\n1:57:03.460 --> 1:57:07.380\n And I had to catch up years of accounting like to the cent\n\n1:57:07.380 --> 1:57:09.940\n and come up with marketing, all of that.\n\n1:57:09.940 --> 1:57:11.660\n And I did it way faster than they thought\n\n1:57:11.660 --> 1:57:13.100\n I would ever be able to do that.\n\n1:57:13.100 --> 1:57:14.460\n At some point they look at me and they're like,\n\n1:57:14.460 --> 1:57:17.260\n look, there is a future for you.\n\n1:57:17.260 --> 1:57:19.780\n And we are too small for that future.\n\n1:57:19.780 --> 1:57:23.220\n And now we could be selfish and keep you here with us.\n\n1:57:23.220 --> 1:57:25.540\n And we would want nothing more than that\n\n1:57:25.540 --> 1:57:27.540\n because really they're like my parents to this day.\n\n1:57:27.540 --> 1:57:29.180\n I just came back from seeing them.\n\n1:57:29.180 --> 1:57:32.260\n And they said, but there's so much more for you\n\n1:57:32.260 --> 1:57:33.620\n and we don't have it.\n\n1:57:33.620 --> 1:57:36.140\n So we want you to go and find out what it is.\n\n1:57:36.140 --> 1:57:37.940\n And that's eventually when I,\n\n1:57:37.940 --> 1:57:41.180\n because something was brewing up in San Francisco\n\n1:57:41.180 --> 1:57:43.500\n when I say I left my heart in San Francisco\n\n1:57:43.500 --> 1:57:47.340\n because the man who would become my husband,\n\n1:57:47.340 --> 1:57:48.820\n we went to the same business school in France,\n\n1:57:48.820 --> 1:57:50.180\n but then he was older than me.\n\n1:57:50.180 --> 1:57:53.380\n So he had come to San Francisco and started a business there.\n\n1:57:53.380 --> 1:57:55.140\n And it just looked like there was something there.\n\n1:57:55.140 --> 1:57:57.220\n And Scarola was like, you gotta go to San Francisco\n\n1:57:57.220 --> 1:57:59.180\n and find out with Emmanuel what's going on.\n\n1:57:59.180 --> 1:58:00.580\n So I went and I left my heart in San Francisco.\n\n1:58:00.580 --> 1:58:02.460\n I came back and I'm like, okay, I'm leaving.\n\n1:58:02.460 --> 1:58:03.700\n Here's the keys to my apartment.\n\n1:58:03.700 --> 1:58:04.900\n What, I don't understand.\n\n1:58:04.900 --> 1:58:06.660\n But I'm like, I'm out of here.\n\n1:58:06.660 --> 1:58:08.940\n So no, but Carol, so this is it.\n\n1:58:08.940 --> 1:58:11.180\n This is what I'm saying, especially in these times\n\n1:58:11.180 --> 1:58:13.420\n when this country loves to dwell on,\n\n1:58:14.820 --> 1:58:16.620\n you're bad because you have this skin color.\n\n1:58:16.620 --> 1:58:18.540\n Here are people with a completely different skin color\n\n1:58:18.540 --> 1:58:20.820\n than mine, completely different faith than mine,\n\n1:58:20.820 --> 1:58:25.820\n yet embraced me, protected me, paid for my visa,\n\n1:58:25.820 --> 1:58:29.820\n you know, for my lawyer, for my H1B, everything,\n\n1:58:29.820 --> 1:58:33.660\n and also played emotional support for me.\n\n1:58:33.660 --> 1:58:36.580\n And no one, no one asked them to do that.\n\n1:58:36.580 --> 1:58:38.020\n They didn't have to do it.\n\n1:58:38.020 --> 1:58:38.860\n They didn't.\n\n1:58:38.860 --> 1:58:39.700\n So what I'm saying is,\n\n1:58:39.700 --> 1:58:41.780\n and this has been the story of my life,\n\n1:58:41.780 --> 1:58:45.060\n everywhere I go, regardless of the hostility around me,\n\n1:58:46.100 --> 1:58:48.180\n you betcha that there's always,\n\n1:58:48.180 --> 1:58:51.300\n always gonna be somebody who shows up for you.\n\n1:58:51.300 --> 1:58:53.540\n And somebody who's at the extremes,\n\n1:58:53.540 --> 1:58:56.820\n at the antipodes of where you are and who you are.\n\n1:58:56.820 --> 1:58:58.220\n And that tells me something.\n\n1:58:59.300 --> 1:59:01.020\n In the end, we are good people.\n\n1:59:01.020 --> 1:59:02.620\n Most people are good people.\n\n1:59:02.620 --> 1:59:04.620\n And there's so much power to that,\n\n1:59:05.500 --> 1:59:10.500\n the internalizing of this idea that we're all just human\n\n1:59:10.620 --> 1:59:13.100\n and there's human kindness all around us.\n\n1:59:13.100 --> 1:59:17.780\n I've seen it a lot where people internalize that\n\n1:59:17.780 --> 1:59:21.420\n and they're able to walk lightly amidst hate\n\n1:59:21.420 --> 1:59:26.420\n and walk past it and it doesn't stick to them\n\n1:59:29.020 --> 1:59:33.060\n in a way that they build resentment and it paralyzes them.\n\n1:59:33.060 --> 1:59:35.940\n If they internalize the world as human,\n\n1:59:35.940 --> 1:59:37.820\n they can be in the, just like you said,\n\n1:59:37.820 --> 1:59:40.620\n in the worst places in the world for them.\n\n1:59:40.620 --> 1:59:44.420\n And someone, somewhere that human magic and touch is there.\n\n1:59:44.420 --> 1:59:46.820\n Yeah, it will find them.\n\n1:59:46.820 --> 1:59:48.460\n It will find, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:59:48.460 --> 1:59:50.300\n And you know, the other thing too, Lex is,\n\n1:59:50.300 --> 1:59:53.060\n especially in these times we're walking in,\n\n1:59:53.060 --> 1:59:55.620\n it is to remind yourself,\n\n1:59:55.620 --> 1:59:58.300\n I think this is where we all are called\n\n1:59:58.300 --> 2:00:01.300\n to practice more courage.\n\n2:00:01.300 --> 2:00:03.260\n I call it courage.\n\n2:00:03.260 --> 2:00:07.140\n It's the courage to show up with curiosity,\n\n2:00:07.140 --> 2:00:09.300\n with empathy and with love.\n\n2:00:09.300 --> 2:00:13.500\n To me, those three are the antidote to pretty much anything.\n\n2:00:13.500 --> 2:00:14.780\n Curiosity and love.\n\n2:00:14.780 --> 2:00:19.700\n In the face of fear, can you show up with curiosity?\n\n2:00:19.700 --> 2:00:22.940\n In the face of hate, can you say,\n\n2:00:22.940 --> 2:00:25.460\n I'm gonna engage with love?\n\n2:00:25.460 --> 2:00:26.620\n Even if I'm scared to death\n\n2:00:26.620 --> 2:00:29.380\n and even if I'm pissed off to death by this,\n\n2:00:29.380 --> 2:00:30.700\n but can you do that?\n\n2:00:30.700 --> 2:00:35.060\n In the face of just like, you know, judgment or whatever,\n\n2:00:35.060 --> 2:00:36.820\n can you show up with empathy?\n\n2:00:36.820 --> 2:00:40.940\n And I had just found that when you try to do that,\n\n2:00:40.940 --> 2:00:44.100\n you engage very different parts of your brain.\n\n2:00:44.100 --> 2:00:46.580\n That's proven by the way, by the brain scientists,\n\n2:00:46.580 --> 2:00:48.860\n but you also can feel it in your body\n\n2:00:48.860 --> 2:00:51.420\n that you're engaging very different parts of your soul.\n\n2:00:51.420 --> 2:00:54.980\n And so I try myself, I'm not always good at it,\n\n2:00:54.980 --> 2:00:57.700\n but it's a practice that I try to honor,\n\n2:00:57.700 --> 2:00:59.700\n which is curiosity, empathy and love.\n\n2:00:59.700 --> 2:01:01.780\n As I told you offline,\n\n2:01:01.780 --> 2:01:04.620\n those, I agree with you 100% on that,\n\n2:01:04.620 --> 2:01:07.900\n but there is, you know, when you go to Ukraine\n\n2:01:07.900 --> 2:01:12.500\n and you can say, you can speak about the power of love,\n\n2:01:12.500 --> 2:01:16.260\n but when you lose your family, when you lose your home,\n\n2:01:16.260 --> 2:01:18.060\n all you have in your heart is hate.\n\n2:01:18.060 --> 2:01:21.540\n Even if you know it, you're not supposed to have it.\n\n2:01:21.540 --> 2:01:22.940\n You still, all you have is hate.\n\n2:01:22.940 --> 2:01:27.940\n So sometimes it's a very human thing\n\n2:01:27.940 --> 2:01:30.500\n to have resentment, to have hate.\n\n2:01:30.500 --> 2:01:33.820\n But it is about trying not to stay there.\n\n2:01:33.820 --> 2:01:36.460\n And it's okay if it takes you years,\n\n2:01:36.460 --> 2:01:40.340\n but it is about trying, and I mean the word trying,\n\n2:01:40.340 --> 2:01:42.820\n it is about trying not to stay there.\n\n2:01:44.460 --> 2:01:45.780\n Let me ask you about some of the things\n\n2:01:45.780 --> 2:01:48.700\n you see in this country from your perspective\n\n2:01:48.700 --> 2:01:50.660\n of everywhere you've been in the world.\n\n2:01:50.660 --> 2:01:53.860\n What do you think about the Black Lives Matter movement\n\n2:01:53.860 --> 2:01:57.260\n here in America that does struggle\n\n2:01:58.580 --> 2:02:03.580\n with the role of skin color today\n\n2:02:04.580 --> 2:02:07.820\n and throughout the history of this country,\n\n2:02:07.820 --> 2:02:10.340\n maybe even throughout the history of the world?\n\n2:02:10.340 --> 2:02:14.740\n Well, Black Lives Matter has been a very hard one for me,\n\n2:02:14.740 --> 2:02:16.780\n because do Black Lives Matter,\n\n2:02:16.780 --> 2:02:18.620\n those three words together in that order,\n\n2:02:18.620 --> 2:02:21.580\n what they mean, they mean everything,\n\n2:02:21.580 --> 2:02:23.580\n because Black Lives do matter,\n\n2:02:23.580 --> 2:02:25.900\n as any other lives do matter.\n\n2:02:25.900 --> 2:02:28.340\n But I know in this case why they say Black Lives Matter,\n\n2:02:28.340 --> 2:02:31.100\n because some of the context we have had.\n\n2:02:31.100 --> 2:02:34.660\n Now, while I agree with the principles\n\n2:02:34.660 --> 2:02:36.100\n that Black Lives Matter,\n\n2:02:36.100 --> 2:02:39.340\n I have a big problem with the organization.\n\n2:02:39.340 --> 2:02:43.060\n With the organization and what it stands for.\n\n2:02:44.860 --> 2:02:47.580\n When I have an organization that pretends\n\n2:02:47.580 --> 2:02:51.220\n to want to stand for Black lives to matter,\n\n2:02:51.220 --> 2:02:56.220\n yet you are self proclaimed Marxist socialists,\n\n2:02:58.740 --> 2:02:59.580\n I pause.\n\n2:03:00.700 --> 2:03:01.620\n Why?\n\n2:03:01.620 --> 2:03:04.180\n I pause and then I'm like, have we learned nothing?\n\n2:03:05.580 --> 2:03:07.860\n Have we learned nothing?\n\n2:03:07.860 --> 2:03:09.980\n And the reason why I say that, Lex,\n\n2:03:09.980 --> 2:03:13.460\n is because 60 some years ago,\n\n2:03:15.740 --> 2:03:18.340\n it started before even 60 some years ago,\n\n2:03:22.980 --> 2:03:24.820\n Black people, in this case,\n\n2:03:24.820 --> 2:03:27.100\n I'm talking about the African people,\n\n2:03:28.380 --> 2:03:32.740\n I'm talking about the Black Africans\n\n2:03:32.740 --> 2:03:37.180\n who would go on to really cement\n\n2:03:37.180 --> 2:03:41.340\n this concept of African emancipation\n\n2:03:41.340 --> 2:03:43.220\n and African liberation.\n\n2:03:43.220 --> 2:03:46.380\n And here I'm taking us back to 1945.\n\n2:03:46.380 --> 2:03:49.180\n They had four of them before that.\n\n2:03:49.180 --> 2:03:53.300\n But in 1945, in Manchester, UK,\n\n2:03:54.340 --> 2:03:56.380\n happened something that would become major\n\n2:03:56.380 --> 2:04:00.100\n for Africa and its future,\n\n2:04:00.100 --> 2:04:01.820\n especially subterranean Africa.\n\n2:04:02.900 --> 2:04:04.860\n In Manchester, UK,\n\n2:04:04.860 --> 2:04:07.780\n people like Blaise Diagne of my country,\n\n2:04:08.740 --> 2:04:13.740\n Nyerere, Tanzania, Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana,\n\n2:04:14.620 --> 2:04:19.060\n and others and others from different parts of the continent\n\n2:04:19.060 --> 2:04:24.060\n got together with Marcus Garvey and W.E.B. Dubois.\n\n2:04:25.580 --> 2:04:27.860\n And I say Dubois because that's how we say it in French.\n\n2:04:27.860 --> 2:04:30.780\n He has a French name, French sounding name at least.\n\n2:04:30.780 --> 2:04:33.620\n And Americans would say, so for Americans listening,\n\n2:04:33.620 --> 2:04:36.940\n I know you say Duboy, but it's Dubois.\n\n2:04:36.940 --> 2:04:38.060\n No, because just in case they're like,\n\n2:04:38.060 --> 2:04:39.140\n who is he talking about?\n\n2:04:39.140 --> 2:04:40.340\n That's who I'm talking about.\n\n2:04:40.340 --> 2:04:44.340\n So all of those people got together in the UK\n\n2:04:45.460 --> 2:04:50.140\n and with W.E.B. Dubois and Marcus Garvey,\n\n2:04:50.140 --> 2:04:53.780\n big top African American intellectuals of their times.\n\n2:04:55.780 --> 2:04:58.620\n W.E.B. Dubois had so many things happen to him,\n\n2:04:58.620 --> 2:04:59.740\n starting from the North,\n\n2:04:59.740 --> 2:05:01.740\n being more or more or less a liberal type guy.\n\n2:05:01.740 --> 2:05:06.740\n You know, came to the South just to see at this time,\n\n2:05:06.780 --> 2:05:08.980\n you know, people, black people being lynched\n\n2:05:08.980 --> 2:05:13.220\n and some of the body parts been shown in store windows.\n\n2:05:13.220 --> 2:05:17.420\n I mean, just for a second, we put ourselves in his shoes.\n\n2:05:17.420 --> 2:05:19.820\n I put myself in his shoes.\n\n2:05:19.820 --> 2:05:22.500\n And that's when he started to become radicalized, right?\n\n2:05:22.500 --> 2:05:24.140\n Because at first it was like, oh, reforms,\n\n2:05:24.140 --> 2:05:25.460\n and I was like, God darn it.\n\n2:05:25.460 --> 2:05:27.100\n And I mean, these people, we don't talk to them.\n\n2:05:27.100 --> 2:05:28.100\n We force, you know.\n\n2:05:28.100 --> 2:05:31.100\n And eventually, little by little, things going through.\n\n2:05:32.940 --> 2:05:34.420\n Yeah, you have these people,\n\n2:05:34.420 --> 2:05:37.860\n they're very much on the Marxist socialist train.\n\n2:05:37.860 --> 2:05:40.860\n So do you think the sort of,\n\n2:05:40.860 --> 2:05:44.220\n it's the political movements that are just using?\n\n2:05:44.220 --> 2:05:48.180\n Yeah, because what happened back in those days, it is true.\n\n2:05:49.180 --> 2:05:52.980\n But to their credit, communist socialists\n\n2:05:52.980 --> 2:05:55.020\n were fighting for equal rights.\n\n2:05:55.020 --> 2:05:56.860\n They were fighting for equal rights.\n\n2:05:56.860 --> 2:05:58.900\n They were fighting for the rights of black people\n\n2:05:58.900 --> 2:06:00.780\n to have equal rights.\n\n2:06:00.780 --> 2:06:05.140\n So of course, I could see why one could say,\n\n2:06:05.140 --> 2:06:09.340\n especially in this times, you've been lynched,\n\n2:06:10.380 --> 2:06:15.380\n bodies burnt, body parts showcased at window stores.\n\n2:06:15.380 --> 2:06:20.380\n Meanwhile, in Africa, under colonization,\n\n2:06:22.140 --> 2:06:25.140\n in your own country, in your own land.\n\n2:06:29.420 --> 2:06:32.020\n And you have this group that's saying,\n\n2:06:34.140 --> 2:06:38.140\n your fight is part of what we fight.\n\n2:06:39.580 --> 2:06:42.220\n And you have this group that's saying,\n\n2:06:42.220 --> 2:06:45.540\n your fight is part of what we fight.\n\n2:06:48.540 --> 2:06:51.180\n Of course, you're gonna say I side with you,\n\n2:06:51.180 --> 2:06:54.380\n especially if this is all happening at a time\n\n2:06:56.180 --> 2:07:01.180\n where, you know, so 1945, these guys who would be\n\n2:07:01.940 --> 2:07:04.300\n the liberators of various African nations,\n\n2:07:04.300 --> 2:07:08.820\n they're meeting with Garvey, with W. E. B. Du Bois.\n\n2:07:08.820 --> 2:07:11.620\n And that's where this meeting is very important.\n\n2:07:11.620 --> 2:07:13.740\n It's the fifth Pan African Congress meeting.\n\n2:07:13.740 --> 2:07:14.900\n It's very important.\n\n2:07:14.900 --> 2:07:17.540\n It's gonna be the last one, but it's the most important one\n\n2:07:17.540 --> 2:07:19.300\n because that's when they formed their plans\n\n2:07:19.300 --> 2:07:22.100\n and really rallied around this concept\n\n2:07:22.100 --> 2:07:26.220\n of African emancipation and African liberation.\n\n2:07:26.220 --> 2:07:28.020\n We're gonna liberate our countries.\n\n2:07:29.100 --> 2:07:31.580\n Then later, so that's how all of these movements\n\n2:07:31.580 --> 2:07:32.900\n started to happen.\n\n2:07:32.900 --> 2:07:35.820\n And from there, Gandhi was already making some progress\n\n2:07:35.820 --> 2:07:39.220\n with India, you know, getting them out of British rule\n\n2:07:39.220 --> 2:07:40.060\n and all of that.\n\n2:07:40.060 --> 2:07:41.460\n So all of this was happening and it really like,\n\n2:07:41.460 --> 2:07:43.340\n this whole thing was bubbling, bubbling, bubbling,\n\n2:07:43.340 --> 2:07:46.260\n you know, like there's like a new force going on.\n\n2:07:46.260 --> 2:07:48.700\n And then we arrive in the late fifties\n\n2:07:48.700 --> 2:07:52.300\n and, you know, Kuma with, you know,\n\n2:07:52.300 --> 2:07:53.340\n them with the British as well,\n\n2:07:53.340 --> 2:07:58.340\n they might manage to become their colonization is over.\n\n2:07:59.740 --> 2:08:02.100\n They're the first one to go in, 57.\n\n2:08:02.100 --> 2:08:04.740\n Then from there, it's what we call the independences.\n\n2:08:04.740 --> 2:08:06.820\n That's what most of Sub Saharan African nation\n\n2:08:06.820 --> 2:08:08.580\n are getting their independence is different dates.\n\n2:08:08.580 --> 2:08:11.060\n Mine, April 4th, 1960.\n\n2:08:11.060 --> 2:08:13.220\n So all over, so this is happening.\n\n2:08:13.220 --> 2:08:14.060\n And now think about it.\n\n2:08:14.060 --> 2:08:16.660\n You're talking 57, you're talking 60.\n\n2:08:16.660 --> 2:08:21.420\n We're like at this time now with the middle of a Cold War.\n\n2:08:21.420 --> 2:08:22.780\n Because we have to put things in context\n\n2:08:22.780 --> 2:08:24.380\n if we wanna understand what's going on.\n\n2:08:24.380 --> 2:08:26.740\n Because people today ask me, why do you think,\n\n2:08:26.740 --> 2:08:28.100\n because even now when they understand,\n\n2:08:28.100 --> 2:08:30.220\n oh, you're right, it makes sense.\n\n2:08:30.220 --> 2:08:32.580\n If you have no economic freedom, you're gonna be poor.\n\n2:08:32.580 --> 2:08:35.020\n But why, why, why did they go for this?\n\n2:08:35.020 --> 2:08:35.860\n Why did they go for this?\n\n2:08:35.860 --> 2:08:37.020\n And then they don't understand.\n\n2:08:37.020 --> 2:08:37.900\n So that's what happened.\n\n2:08:37.900 --> 2:08:41.980\n So beginning of day of times, pre colonial Africans\n\n2:08:41.980 --> 2:08:44.340\n were free marketeers, free enterprise.\n\n2:08:44.340 --> 2:08:47.220\n It's pretty well recorded by someone like George Aite.\n\n2:08:47.220 --> 2:08:49.340\n That's where I got the cheat I think from\n\n2:08:49.340 --> 2:08:50.740\n and Ghanaian economist.\n\n2:08:50.740 --> 2:08:52.980\n And then slavery happened, colonialism happened.\n\n2:08:52.980 --> 2:08:55.860\n And then the independences, late fifties, early sixties\n\n2:08:55.860 --> 2:08:58.940\n for most sub Saharan African countries.\n\n2:08:58.940 --> 2:09:00.740\n So there what you have is,\n\n2:09:00.740 --> 2:09:02.100\n but then what happened there?\n\n2:09:02.100 --> 2:09:05.580\n So I told you in 45, fifth Pan African Congress in the UK\n\n2:09:05.580 --> 2:09:10.580\n with the liberators of Africa under the leadership\n\n2:09:11.500 --> 2:09:14.820\n because he was the wise, you know, eldest man.\n\n2:09:15.860 --> 2:09:17.860\n Dubois was, he was in his seventies back in the day.\n\n2:09:17.860 --> 2:09:19.220\n So he's older than them, you know,\n\n2:09:19.220 --> 2:09:21.460\n and he's coming with all of his ideas and everything.\n\n2:09:21.460 --> 2:09:22.540\n So they're like, ooh.\n\n2:09:22.540 --> 2:09:23.780\n So there they are.\n\n2:09:23.780 --> 2:09:25.540\n Now we're in the late fifties, early sixties.\n\n2:09:25.540 --> 2:09:28.020\n We're starting to make progress with the independences.\n\n2:09:28.020 --> 2:09:29.660\n You know, India has gone there before.\n\n2:09:29.660 --> 2:09:31.580\n So all of that is starting to happen.\n\n2:09:32.780 --> 2:09:35.300\n And at that time, remember,\n\n2:09:35.300 --> 2:09:37.700\n they already were being introduced\n\n2:09:37.700 --> 2:09:40.340\n to the concept of socialism, Marxism,\n\n2:09:40.340 --> 2:09:44.820\n all of that way before by some of these, you know,\n\n2:09:44.820 --> 2:09:48.060\n black African American intellectuals of their time\n\n2:09:48.060 --> 2:09:51.260\n who were very socialist Marxist by that time.\n\n2:09:51.260 --> 2:09:54.140\n So now they're becoming independent\n\n2:09:54.140 --> 2:09:56.620\n because I do independent like this\n\n2:09:56.620 --> 2:10:00.700\n because I reckon that there's still neocolonism going on.\n\n2:10:00.700 --> 2:10:04.020\n So now this is happening, they're becoming free.\n\n2:10:04.020 --> 2:10:06.220\n But then you look around, what do you see?\n\n2:10:07.260 --> 2:10:10.500\n That now most of these liberators of their nations\n\n2:10:10.500 --> 2:10:12.380\n become the president of the nations.\n\n2:10:12.380 --> 2:10:13.740\n But remember what I told you?\n\n2:10:13.740 --> 2:10:18.740\n Most of them have dranken the Marxist socialism Koolaid.\n\n2:10:21.740 --> 2:10:25.460\n So as these African nations become independent\n\n2:10:25.460 --> 2:10:27.660\n with their first independent governments\n\n2:10:27.660 --> 2:10:31.540\n and, you know, presidents, most of them,\n\n2:10:31.540 --> 2:10:34.620\n most of them are socialist,\n\n2:10:34.620 --> 2:10:37.300\n various forms of statist type of government.\n\n2:10:38.220 --> 2:10:40.220\n And this is because at that point,\n\n2:10:40.220 --> 2:10:43.220\n we had made a fatal mistake of going,\n\n2:10:43.220 --> 2:10:48.220\n of saying we are Marxist socialist\n\n2:10:48.260 --> 2:10:51.700\n because you guys fight for equal rights.\n\n2:10:51.700 --> 2:10:53.340\n So in this case, there should be no colonialism\n\n2:10:53.340 --> 2:10:54.940\n or anything like that.\n\n2:10:54.940 --> 2:10:58.700\n So not only you have that going on and the people,\n\n2:10:58.700 --> 2:11:01.980\n so right now you had this battle of ideology going on\n\n2:11:01.980 --> 2:11:04.780\n because on one end represented by freedom\n\n2:11:04.780 --> 2:11:06.020\n and the economic, what do you call it?\n\n2:11:06.020 --> 2:11:08.380\n The economic system they were using is capitalism.\n\n2:11:08.380 --> 2:11:12.100\n And these are represented by the Western nations\n\n2:11:12.100 --> 2:11:14.260\n facing off with Eastern block,\n\n2:11:14.260 --> 2:11:16.220\n practicing various forms of statism,\n\n2:11:16.220 --> 2:11:19.060\n socialism, communism, various forms of statism.\n\n2:11:19.060 --> 2:11:21.460\n And these two are fighting for influence.\n\n2:11:21.460 --> 2:11:25.180\n So, and we also have, it's also not, so two things there.\n\n2:11:25.180 --> 2:11:27.300\n One is we're at a time where,\n\n2:11:27.300 --> 2:11:29.940\n remember the free market concept was almost dead,\n\n2:11:30.820 --> 2:11:31.860\n almost dead.\n\n2:11:33.020 --> 2:11:35.940\n So almost every intellectual at that time\n\n2:11:35.940 --> 2:11:40.260\n was social Marxist or Marxist socialist,\n\n2:11:40.260 --> 2:11:42.260\n I put the name, that's what you were.\n\n2:11:42.260 --> 2:11:45.140\n So you're in a world where it was a normal thing,\n\n2:11:45.140 --> 2:11:47.900\n it was just mainstream acceptance.\n\n2:11:47.900 --> 2:11:49.700\n So not only you have that force,\n\n2:11:49.700 --> 2:11:51.700\n but at the same time,\n\n2:11:51.700 --> 2:11:53.500\n if these two forces are fighting one another,\n\n2:11:53.500 --> 2:11:57.140\n it turns out that the one representing capitalism\n\n2:11:57.140 --> 2:11:59.380\n and freedom, well, sorry,\n\n2:11:59.380 --> 2:12:03.140\n but isn't it you who enslaved us and colonized us?\n\n2:12:03.140 --> 2:12:06.780\n And you're fighting with the people who represent,\n\n2:12:06.780 --> 2:12:09.740\n supposedly people who are saying that\n\n2:12:09.740 --> 2:12:11.580\n who had been fighting for equal rights for us,\n\n2:12:11.580 --> 2:12:15.100\n with us for the longest time, these are our friends.\n\n2:12:15.100 --> 2:12:17.180\n And that's when we made a fatal mistake\n\n2:12:17.180 --> 2:12:19.260\n because while yes, there were maybe good things\n\n2:12:19.260 --> 2:12:23.500\n to agree on with Marxist socialist of the times,\n\n2:12:23.500 --> 2:12:28.060\n especially equal rights for all people and all of that,\n\n2:12:28.060 --> 2:12:29.340\n that's the only thing we should have,\n\n2:12:29.340 --> 2:12:31.500\n among the only things we should have agreed upon.\n\n2:12:31.500 --> 2:12:35.060\n There are violent revolution tendencies, no way.\n\n2:12:35.060 --> 2:12:38.900\n When it comes to the economic nonsense, no way.\n\n2:12:38.900 --> 2:12:41.340\n We should not have thrown the baby out with the bathwater,\n\n2:12:41.340 --> 2:12:42.460\n but that's what we did.\n\n2:12:42.460 --> 2:12:43.820\n And that's when we made a fatal mistake.\n\n2:12:43.820 --> 2:12:46.900\n So then we became free, all of these nations,\n\n2:12:46.900 --> 2:12:51.900\n and most of them started with socialist or communist leaders.\n\n2:12:52.140 --> 2:12:56.500\n My country, socialist, L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor,\n\n2:12:56.500 --> 2:12:58.380\n he was a socialist.\n\n2:12:58.380 --> 2:13:01.180\n And they stayed in power for 40 years,\n\n2:13:01.180 --> 2:13:04.540\n the first 40 years of our freedom years.\n\n2:13:05.700 --> 2:13:07.740\n And all over the continent, more or less,\n\n2:13:07.740 --> 2:13:09.340\n that's what you had.\n\n2:13:09.340 --> 2:13:11.140\n And on top of that,\n\n2:13:11.140 --> 2:13:12.780\n something else that the French don't know,\n\n2:13:12.780 --> 2:13:16.140\n the people don't know is France with its colonies said,\n\n2:13:16.140 --> 2:13:18.220\n you cannot, not do,\n\n2:13:18.220 --> 2:13:23.220\n you have to keep the French civil law.\n\n2:13:25.140 --> 2:13:29.580\n So we're talking about the Napoleonic civil code.\n\n2:13:29.580 --> 2:13:31.100\n Are you kidding me?\n\n2:13:31.100 --> 2:13:32.300\n So that's what happened.\n\n2:13:32.300 --> 2:13:37.300\n So the reason why I go back to BLM is while I have\n\n2:13:37.460 --> 2:13:40.180\n all the respect in the world\n\n2:13:40.180 --> 2:13:43.140\n and all the compassion in the world\n\n2:13:43.140 --> 2:13:45.500\n for people like Krummer, for people like Nyerere,\n\n2:13:45.500 --> 2:13:48.420\n for people, all of us people of those times,\n\n2:13:48.420 --> 2:13:50.140\n the liberators of Africa,\n\n2:13:50.140 --> 2:13:53.540\n while I have so much love, compassion for them,\n\n2:13:54.700 --> 2:13:57.100\n I am also able to say,\n\n2:13:57.100 --> 2:14:01.500\n because I got the benefit of 60 some years time,\n\n2:14:01.500 --> 2:14:05.620\n and where you get to do a debrief\n\n2:14:05.620 --> 2:14:08.380\n and see what worked, what didn't work, what happened.\n\n2:14:08.380 --> 2:14:13.060\n We have had the 60 years to look back and to reflect.\n\n2:14:13.060 --> 2:14:17.620\n So yes, I can understand why they did what they did.\n\n2:14:17.620 --> 2:14:21.500\n I can understand why they sided with these people\n\n2:14:21.500 --> 2:14:24.260\n who on the surface, or at least some part of a fight\n\n2:14:24.260 --> 2:14:27.220\n was the same fight as them when it came to equal rights.\n\n2:14:29.740 --> 2:14:30.940\n I can excuse them,\n\n2:14:32.660 --> 2:14:37.580\n but I will not excuse the BLM founders\n\n2:14:37.580 --> 2:14:42.580\n because that mistake was tolerable 60 some years ago.\n\n2:14:43.700 --> 2:14:45.980\n Today, no.\n\n2:14:45.980 --> 2:14:50.980\n The blacks of today cannot be serious\n\n2:14:51.100 --> 2:14:55.900\n about black lives mattering and saying in the same sentence,\n\n2:14:55.900 --> 2:14:58.500\n and we're going to be socialist Marx, Marxist socialist.\n\n2:14:58.500 --> 2:14:59.820\n It just doesn't work.\n\n2:14:59.820 --> 2:15:03.540\n So the BLM movement is too deeply integrated\n\n2:15:03.540 --> 2:15:06.260\n with the ideas of Marxism.\n\n2:15:06.260 --> 2:15:10.940\n Yeah, they're anti free market, anti capitalist.\n\n2:15:10.940 --> 2:15:15.540\n And we do know that you have to have the free markets\n\n2:15:15.540 --> 2:15:17.380\n in order to build prosperity.\n\n2:15:17.380 --> 2:15:21.900\n And prosperity means economic power.\n\n2:15:21.900 --> 2:15:26.540\n If you have economic power, no one messes with you,\n\n2:15:26.540 --> 2:15:28.380\n or if they're gonna do it, they're gonna have to think twice.\n\n2:15:28.380 --> 2:15:31.180\n And when they do, they're gonna have to pay consequences.\n\n2:15:32.580 --> 2:15:35.380\n So if you want for blacks to be respected\n\n2:15:35.380 --> 2:15:37.220\n anywhere in the world,\n\n2:15:37.220 --> 2:15:39.980\n you're gonna have to be serious about black prosperity,\n\n2:15:39.980 --> 2:15:42.220\n all mass, not just a few people,\n\n2:15:42.220 --> 2:15:44.900\n Oprah over here and somebody over there, no.\n\n2:15:44.900 --> 2:15:49.900\n We as a group have to be critical mass of prosperity\n\n2:15:50.820 --> 2:15:52.580\n across the board.\n\n2:15:52.580 --> 2:15:55.380\n And because we're talking critical mass of prosperity\n\n2:15:55.380 --> 2:15:56.620\n across the board,\n\n2:15:56.620 --> 2:15:59.820\n it means black people everywhere in the world.\n\n2:15:59.820 --> 2:16:00.900\n But guess what?\n\n2:16:00.900 --> 2:16:04.900\n We in Africa happen to represent 90% of our representatives\n\n2:16:04.900 --> 2:16:06.180\n of a black race.\n\n2:16:06.180 --> 2:16:08.980\n So you're gonna be serious about black lives mattering\n\n2:16:08.980 --> 2:16:11.420\n without being serious for Africa,\n\n2:16:11.420 --> 2:16:14.100\n the 1 billion people in Africa that are black\n\n2:16:14.100 --> 2:16:16.340\n and for them to have access to the free markets\n\n2:16:16.340 --> 2:16:18.180\n and yes, fossil fuels,\n\n2:16:18.180 --> 2:16:23.180\n so that they can rocket up prosperity wise.\n\n2:16:25.220 --> 2:16:27.700\n And the resources of the young people, the young minds.\n\n2:16:27.700 --> 2:16:29.620\n So that all of these young people, young minds\n\n2:16:29.620 --> 2:16:33.700\n can finally manifest their greatness that I know they have\n\n2:16:33.700 --> 2:16:35.220\n and that they're showing us every day\n\n2:16:35.220 --> 2:16:37.740\n despite the obstacles.\n\n2:16:38.620 --> 2:16:40.100\n That's what we need.\n\n2:16:40.100 --> 2:16:42.660\n Senegal becomes rich and Senegal can become\n\n2:16:42.660 --> 2:16:45.020\n and will be richer than France.\n\n2:16:45.020 --> 2:16:46.700\n Singapore did it, we can do it.\n\n2:16:47.780 --> 2:16:52.260\n Mali rich, Nigeria rich, functioning as well.\n\n2:16:52.260 --> 2:16:56.540\n Malawi rich, Tanzania rich, Uganda rich,\n\n2:16:56.540 --> 2:17:01.540\n Zimbabwe rich, Niger rich, everywhere rich prosperous\n\n2:17:01.540 --> 2:17:05.580\n as prosperous, if not more prosperous than Switzerland\n\n2:17:05.580 --> 2:17:07.860\n or Singapore or the U.S.\n\n2:17:07.860 --> 2:17:09.860\n I don't know, or the Lichtenstein or Luxembourg,\n\n2:17:09.860 --> 2:17:14.860\n places that have no natural resources.\n\n2:17:15.500 --> 2:17:18.620\n We become rich and you watch the world\n\n2:17:18.620 --> 2:17:21.940\n having a very different relationship with us.\n\n2:17:21.940 --> 2:17:26.740\n That's the only time we will commend any type of respect.\n\n2:17:26.740 --> 2:17:31.740\n That's when people, even our common psyche will change\n\n2:17:32.940 --> 2:17:34.180\n even about black people.\n\n2:17:34.180 --> 2:17:36.820\n All of the stereotypes that they have of us\n\n2:17:36.820 --> 2:17:39.620\n is gonna melt away.\n\n2:17:39.620 --> 2:17:44.140\n And you may still not like us, but you will still respect us\n\n2:17:44.140 --> 2:17:47.260\n because we are a force to be dealt with.\n\n2:17:47.260 --> 2:17:49.660\n And only economic power does that.\n\n2:17:49.660 --> 2:17:53.540\n It would be nice, of course, for us to respect people\n\n2:17:53.540 --> 2:17:54.900\n because they're people.\n\n2:17:54.900 --> 2:17:58.100\n It would be nice, but let us not kid ourselves.\n\n2:17:58.100 --> 2:18:00.300\n This is earth.\n\n2:18:00.300 --> 2:18:03.660\n And someone said, nice people will make it to heaven,\n\n2:18:03.660 --> 2:18:05.460\n but not to Harvard necessarily.\n\n2:18:05.460 --> 2:18:06.300\n It's true.\n\n2:18:06.300 --> 2:18:11.300\n It's interesting that pity does not ever turn into respect.\n\n2:18:12.660 --> 2:18:14.180\n It would be nice if it did.\n\n2:18:14.180 --> 2:18:16.580\n It would be nice, but it doesn't.\n\n2:18:16.580 --> 2:18:17.580\n Prosperity is the only thing.\n\n2:18:17.580 --> 2:18:19.060\n Prosperity is the only thing.\n\n2:18:19.060 --> 2:18:21.420\n And the way we do that, there is no,\n\n2:18:21.420 --> 2:18:26.420\n just like all of us humans have to inhale oxygen\n\n2:18:27.660 --> 2:18:30.580\n and exhale carbon dioxide.\n\n2:18:30.580 --> 2:18:32.780\n That's a human way of breathing.\n\n2:18:32.780 --> 2:18:35.140\n You bring me on, but you wanna be foolish\n\n2:18:35.140 --> 2:18:36.980\n and be like, oh, well, sorry.\n\n2:18:36.980 --> 2:18:38.180\n That's how white people breathe.\n\n2:18:38.180 --> 2:18:39.260\n So as black people,\n\n2:18:39.260 --> 2:18:40.340\n we're gonna have to do something different.\n\n2:18:40.340 --> 2:18:42.060\n Well, good luck with that.\n\n2:18:42.060 --> 2:18:42.900\n Right?\n\n2:18:42.900 --> 2:18:44.460\n So this is here why I'm saying,\n\n2:18:44.460 --> 2:18:46.620\n I have no patience for Black Lives Matter.\n\n2:18:46.620 --> 2:18:51.380\n They're making a mistake that was made 60 some plus 60.\n\n2:18:51.380 --> 2:18:53.940\n Years ago, even more than that.\n\n2:18:53.940 --> 2:18:55.300\n Maybe even a hundred, you know,\n\n2:18:55.300 --> 2:18:58.300\n when we were siding with the Marxist socialists\n\n2:18:58.300 --> 2:19:00.340\n because they're the ones who've been fighting\n\n2:19:00.340 --> 2:19:01.420\n for equal rights.\n\n2:19:03.700 --> 2:19:07.460\n Let me ask you though, about racism.\n\n2:19:08.700 --> 2:19:11.020\n Do you, as you travel through this world,\n\n2:19:11.020 --> 2:19:13.260\n as you travel through America,\n\n2:19:13.260 --> 2:19:16.660\n feel the burn of hatred?\n\n2:19:18.300 --> 2:19:19.940\n You've spoken about the revolutions\n\n2:19:19.940 --> 2:19:23.340\n that have been fought throughout the 20th century\n\n2:19:23.340 --> 2:19:25.740\n against racism.\n\n2:19:25.740 --> 2:19:29.300\n But today, as people talk about educating,\n\n2:19:29.300 --> 2:19:31.460\n reminding the world with the,\n\n2:19:31.460 --> 2:19:33.340\n even with more philosophical ideas\n\n2:19:33.340 --> 2:19:35.780\n of critical race theory, for example,\n\n2:19:35.780 --> 2:19:38.460\n do you think this is still a battle\n\n2:19:38.460 --> 2:19:40.740\n that needs to be fought\n\n2:19:40.740 --> 2:19:43.620\n at the forefront of culture in the United States?\n\n2:19:43.620 --> 2:19:48.620\n Um, does racism exist?\n\n2:19:48.820 --> 2:19:49.660\n Yes, it does.\n\n2:19:52.100 --> 2:19:54.180\n But all forms of isms exist.\n\n2:19:55.180 --> 2:19:58.020\n Some people, it's about various forms of ableism.\n\n2:19:59.780 --> 2:20:01.700\n Others, it's about size.\n\n2:20:02.900 --> 2:20:05.420\n And racism, yes, is one of them.\n\n2:20:05.420 --> 2:20:06.260\n Does it exist?\n\n2:20:06.260 --> 2:20:07.100\n Yes, it does.\n\n2:20:08.420 --> 2:20:11.300\n But is it what's gonna stop anyone\n\n2:20:11.300 --> 2:20:13.620\n from manifesting their greatest potential?\n\n2:20:14.820 --> 2:20:16.220\n I say no.\n\n2:20:16.220 --> 2:20:18.340\n I say no.\n\n2:20:18.340 --> 2:20:20.660\n Many people in this country have showed it.\n\n2:20:22.020 --> 2:20:23.460\n Whether they're African Americans\n\n2:20:23.460 --> 2:20:26.380\n or African immigrant, I'm an African immigrant.\n\n2:20:27.540 --> 2:20:30.020\n You have African Americans like Oprah and others,\n\n2:20:30.020 --> 2:20:31.820\n and other people even before her,\n\n2:20:32.940 --> 2:20:36.580\n who despite the nastiness around them,\n\n2:20:36.580 --> 2:20:37.780\n were able to make it.\n\n2:20:37.780 --> 2:20:41.580\n So we do know, especially as black people,\n\n2:20:41.580 --> 2:20:44.020\n but I think it's humanity as a whole.\n\n2:20:44.020 --> 2:20:46.460\n And that's what I love about the human spirit.\n\n2:20:46.460 --> 2:20:48.620\n It's resiliency.\n\n2:20:48.620 --> 2:20:50.180\n But resiliency only can happen\n\n2:20:50.180 --> 2:20:53.060\n if you don't allow yourself to be beaten down\n\n2:20:54.260 --> 2:20:56.540\n and to lose yourself of agency.\n\n2:20:58.340 --> 2:21:01.740\n It's, of course, easier said than done.\n\n2:21:01.740 --> 2:21:05.740\n And some among us need a little bit more help\n\n2:21:05.740 --> 2:21:08.580\n to not succumb for it than others do.\n\n2:21:09.860 --> 2:21:10.940\n And I've seen it.\n\n2:21:10.940 --> 2:21:12.620\n It might be harder for you\n\n2:21:12.620 --> 2:21:16.900\n if you're somewhere in inner city,\n\n2:21:18.020 --> 2:21:19.980\n inner city black America.\n\n2:21:19.980 --> 2:21:22.860\n Maybe the environment might be a little bit tougher\n\n2:21:22.860 --> 2:21:24.300\n for you to try and get your act together\n\n2:21:24.300 --> 2:21:25.860\n and all of that stuff.\n\n2:21:25.860 --> 2:21:27.700\n And it's okay.\n\n2:21:27.700 --> 2:21:30.300\n But even in that situation,\n\n2:21:32.060 --> 2:21:34.300\n we need to, I think it's important\n\n2:21:34.300 --> 2:21:37.420\n that we still do not rob you of your agency.\n\n2:21:39.220 --> 2:21:42.460\n And this is where I am mad as heck\n\n2:21:42.460 --> 2:21:46.660\n against those who supposedly care\n\n2:21:46.660 --> 2:21:50.300\n and their idea of how to make sure\n\n2:21:50.300 --> 2:21:53.380\n that I don't become or stay a victim of racism\n\n2:21:53.380 --> 2:21:55.260\n is through all the things we talked about,\n\n2:21:55.260 --> 2:22:00.260\n the CRT, the anti racism crap of, you know,\n\n2:22:00.260 --> 2:22:05.260\n Ibrahim X. Kendi and what's her name, Robin DiAngelo.\n\n2:22:05.020 --> 2:22:07.020\n I mean her, I'm shocked.\n\n2:22:07.020 --> 2:22:09.300\n The woman is making all of this money\n\n2:22:09.300 --> 2:22:13.060\n supposedly fighting a war on our behalf.\n\n2:22:13.060 --> 2:22:15.500\n I'm like, lady, I hear you loud and clear\n\n2:22:15.500 --> 2:22:16.900\n that you are a true racist.\n\n2:22:16.900 --> 2:22:19.180\n I know, but you told me you are.\n\n2:22:19.180 --> 2:22:20.780\n And for you to think that your anti racism\n\n2:22:20.780 --> 2:22:24.060\n makes you less racist and it's, that happens too.\n\n2:22:24.060 --> 2:22:26.180\n She comes from a racist background.\n\n2:22:26.180 --> 2:22:28.180\n Fine, she's saying it, it's true.\n\n2:22:28.180 --> 2:22:33.180\n But this idea that every walking person on earth\n\n2:22:33.220 --> 2:22:34.620\n belongs to one category or the other,\n\n2:22:34.620 --> 2:22:37.420\n depending on what, you know, which skin color you came with,\n\n2:22:38.420 --> 2:22:41.220\n it's problematic at its root.\n\n2:22:41.220 --> 2:22:44.700\n So my point is, does racism exist?\n\n2:22:44.700 --> 2:22:45.540\n Yes.\n\n2:22:46.780 --> 2:22:47.620\n Do you think it's gonna stop me\n\n2:22:47.620 --> 2:22:49.340\n from doing anything I have to do?\n\n2:22:49.340 --> 2:22:50.500\n No.\n\n2:22:50.500 --> 2:22:53.020\n Might it make it harder, longer?\n\n2:22:53.020 --> 2:22:57.100\n Maybe, but it will not stop me from doing anything.\n\n2:22:57.100 --> 2:22:58.500\n But it will not stop me.\n\n2:23:00.180 --> 2:23:01.940\n But for it not to stop me,\n\n2:23:01.940 --> 2:23:04.380\n I can't engage in victimhood mentality.\n\n2:23:04.380 --> 2:23:05.980\n I can't lose myself as self.\n\n2:23:05.980 --> 2:23:09.540\n I got to use all the agency that I have\n\n2:23:09.540 --> 2:23:12.380\n to fight back and fight beyond.\n\n2:23:12.380 --> 2:23:14.460\n See, it's just a bit of fight back.\n\n2:23:14.460 --> 2:23:15.740\n You fight back and you fight beyond.\n\n2:23:15.740 --> 2:23:18.460\n Cause at some point, yeah and.\n\n2:23:18.460 --> 2:23:19.940\n It's this concept of yes and.\n\n2:23:20.900 --> 2:23:24.220\n So this is why I have loved the job.\n\n2:23:24.220 --> 2:23:26.340\n So when I have somebody who is like,\n\n2:23:26.340 --> 2:23:28.780\n oh, anti racism is a way.\n\n2:23:28.780 --> 2:23:31.260\n We're gonna go and tell all the white kids\n\n2:23:31.260 --> 2:23:32.980\n that, you know, because they will happen to be white,\n\n2:23:32.980 --> 2:23:35.580\n that they're really the oppressors and blah, blah, blah.\n\n2:23:35.580 --> 2:23:38.820\n And the black kids, because they're black, you know,\n\n2:23:38.820 --> 2:23:41.500\n you're not changing anything when you're doing that.\n\n2:23:41.500 --> 2:23:43.060\n Nothing except that you're causing,\n\n2:23:43.060 --> 2:23:43.980\n you're putting problems\n\n2:23:43.980 --> 2:23:46.300\n where there were no problems to start with.\n\n2:23:46.300 --> 2:23:48.140\n All we had to do was maybe\n\n2:23:48.140 --> 2:23:50.060\n go for a different route from there.\n\n2:23:50.060 --> 2:23:51.260\n Kids are kids.\n\n2:23:51.260 --> 2:23:52.460\n Kids are born kids.\n\n2:23:52.460 --> 2:23:54.500\n And this, I'm not sure if you want to get me going\n\n2:23:54.500 --> 2:23:57.580\n onto the whole science of bias,\n\n2:23:57.580 --> 2:23:59.940\n because that's something I spent years of my life on.\n\n2:23:59.940 --> 2:24:03.860\n And my journey on the science of bias\n\n2:24:03.860 --> 2:24:08.060\n started with the days of Philando Castile,\n\n2:24:08.060 --> 2:24:12.300\n Eric Garner, that whole summer of 2016,\n\n2:24:12.300 --> 2:24:17.300\n when we had this horrendous, horrendous situation\n\n2:24:17.340 --> 2:24:20.340\n of black people being killed by the police,\n\n2:24:20.340 --> 2:24:22.420\n where they shot before asking,\n\n2:24:22.420 --> 2:24:24.860\n and people left to die in the most inhumane way\n\n2:24:24.860 --> 2:24:28.020\n for the rest of us to watch from the social media.\n\n2:24:28.020 --> 2:24:29.820\n That's me.\n\n2:24:29.820 --> 2:24:31.340\n That's when my George Floyd moment happened.\n\n2:24:31.340 --> 2:24:32.420\n Not later than four years ago,\n\n2:24:32.420 --> 2:24:35.100\n and the whole world is like, you know.\n\n2:24:35.100 --> 2:24:38.620\n So that sent me on a journey\n\n2:24:38.620 --> 2:24:42.020\n of understanding what discrimination is and bias is.\n\n2:24:43.620 --> 2:24:45.460\n And in a way, that's the reason why I started this company\n\n2:24:45.460 --> 2:24:47.900\n that I even called Skinny Skin.\n\n2:24:47.900 --> 2:24:49.180\n That's where it came from.\n\n2:24:49.180 --> 2:24:51.140\n Again, criticized by creating.\n\n2:24:51.140 --> 2:24:53.860\n I needed to understand what discrimination was.\n\n2:24:53.860 --> 2:24:55.060\n How does it work?\n\n2:24:55.060 --> 2:24:56.900\n Is it true what Kendi is saying?\n\n2:24:56.900 --> 2:24:58.620\n Is it true what DAngelo is saying?\n\n2:24:58.620 --> 2:25:03.620\n Is it true that it could be that your race\n\n2:25:03.820 --> 2:25:06.500\n is just because of the skin color you happen to be born in?\n\n2:25:06.500 --> 2:25:08.220\n Is it true?\n\n2:25:08.220 --> 2:25:09.260\n Is it true?\n\n2:25:09.260 --> 2:25:12.540\n I needed to know, because I was at a time of my life\n\n2:25:12.540 --> 2:25:14.660\n where at some point, you know,\n\n2:25:14.660 --> 2:25:16.780\n when those killings were happening,\n\n2:25:16.780 --> 2:25:21.020\n it was so hard for me being a black person in this country.\n\n2:25:21.020 --> 2:25:22.580\n And wondering,\n\n2:25:27.780 --> 2:25:29.420\n I mean, what is this?\n\n2:25:29.420 --> 2:25:31.700\n And what do we do with this?\n\n2:25:33.980 --> 2:25:34.900\n Yeah, is it true?\n\n2:25:34.900 --> 2:25:38.660\n How much discrimination am I operating under in the system?\n\n2:25:38.660 --> 2:25:39.780\n All of that.\n\n2:25:39.780 --> 2:25:42.540\n You need to understand the full characteristics of,\n\n2:25:42.540 --> 2:25:45.260\n if you're dreaming of making a big change\n\n2:25:45.260 --> 2:25:49.220\n by building companies, you have to kind of intuit,\n\n2:25:49.220 --> 2:25:51.100\n how much, what am I up against?\n\n2:25:51.100 --> 2:25:52.340\n What am I up against, right?\n\n2:25:52.340 --> 2:25:53.580\n And so this is why, you know,\n\n2:25:53.580 --> 2:25:55.860\n spend all of this time on some of the work.\n\n2:25:55.860 --> 2:25:58.860\n And then eventually I understood that discrimination,\n\n2:25:58.860 --> 2:26:01.340\n if you wanted to understand it beyond,\n\n2:26:01.340 --> 2:26:04.540\n it's, you know, beyond the big lines of,\n\n2:26:04.540 --> 2:26:06.500\n especially the clickbait lines\n\n2:26:06.500 --> 2:26:08.780\n would make it very black and white.\n\n2:26:08.780 --> 2:26:11.300\n Then I had to really take a moment and I spent time,\n\n2:26:11.300 --> 2:26:13.700\n you know, with a world of brain scientists,\n\n2:26:13.700 --> 2:26:16.700\n with behavioral psychologists,\n\n2:26:16.700 --> 2:26:18.580\n with evolutionary biologists.\n\n2:26:18.580 --> 2:26:21.780\n We have all of this ecosystem, but together form\n\n2:26:21.780 --> 2:26:25.380\n what one might call the science of bias.\n\n2:26:25.380 --> 2:26:28.780\n And especially I came across the work\n\n2:26:28.780 --> 2:26:31.820\n of this team of scientists at the University of,\n\n2:26:31.820 --> 2:26:33.460\n I think it's Wisconsin,\n\n2:26:33.460 --> 2:26:35.900\n and they're the only ones who made sense\n\n2:26:36.980 --> 2:26:39.180\n in this sea of nonsense back then.\n\n2:26:40.140 --> 2:26:42.700\n And this article was in Politico,\n\n2:26:43.660 --> 2:26:47.060\n and it was saying something that I could relate to it.\n\n2:26:47.060 --> 2:26:49.820\n And eventually what I learned was,\n\n2:26:50.740 --> 2:26:54.220\n and this part comes from the evolutionary biologist people,\n\n2:26:54.220 --> 2:26:58.100\n they in a way tell you that right around age three,\n\n2:26:58.100 --> 2:26:59.460\n can happen sooner or later,\n\n2:26:59.460 --> 2:27:01.260\n because you know, we're all different,\n\n2:27:01.260 --> 2:27:04.220\n but you go from this person who has to rely\n\n2:27:04.220 --> 2:27:07.780\n on these other people, usually your parents, to stay alive,\n\n2:27:07.780 --> 2:27:10.980\n to be fed, to be housed, to be in your diaper change,\n\n2:27:10.980 --> 2:27:12.900\n all of that stuff, right?\n\n2:27:12.900 --> 2:27:15.660\n To now, something is kicking in.\n\n2:27:15.660 --> 2:27:20.660\n Where you have to, in order for you to survive,\n\n2:27:21.660 --> 2:27:23.500\n and this is all wired in,\n\n2:27:23.500 --> 2:27:25.900\n so you don't even understand it consciously,\n\n2:27:25.900 --> 2:27:27.340\n as I'm saying it now,\n\n2:27:27.340 --> 2:27:29.700\n where in order for you to survive,\n\n2:27:29.700 --> 2:27:32.060\n in order for you to go from this state of dependency\n\n2:27:32.060 --> 2:27:35.820\n to the next stage and more and more and more,\n\n2:27:35.820 --> 2:27:37.740\n you're gonna have to develop this ability\n\n2:27:37.740 --> 2:27:39.540\n to make sense of the world.\n\n2:27:39.540 --> 2:27:41.020\n And what's making sense of a world\n\n2:27:41.020 --> 2:27:43.420\n at its most basic level means is,\n\n2:27:43.420 --> 2:27:46.340\n can you determine if a situation\n\n2:27:46.340 --> 2:27:48.820\n or a person is good or bad for you?\n\n2:27:49.980 --> 2:27:54.100\n Failure, and you need to be able to do so ever so quickly,\n\n2:27:54.100 --> 2:27:56.660\n because failure to be able to do that\n\n2:27:56.660 --> 2:27:59.300\n means that you might not be alive the next second.\n\n2:28:00.580 --> 2:28:02.900\n See, it's so wired in.\n\n2:28:02.900 --> 2:28:04.780\n So this process is starting to kick in.\n\n2:28:06.020 --> 2:28:07.580\n And at that point,\n\n2:28:07.580 --> 2:28:09.980\n your brain is gonna be your best ally for that.\n\n2:28:09.980 --> 2:28:12.820\n And what the brain is gonna do is it's gonna help you,\n\n2:28:12.820 --> 2:28:15.100\n and the way the brain works is through,\n\n2:28:15.100 --> 2:28:19.220\n it works with, it's all wired for efficiency.\n\n2:28:19.220 --> 2:28:24.220\n And the way it goes for efficiency is through automation,\n\n2:28:24.300 --> 2:28:25.980\n meaning that every time it has computed,\n\n2:28:25.980 --> 2:28:27.540\n and you probably know these things way better than me,\n\n2:28:27.540 --> 2:28:30.940\n every time it has computed one algorithm,\n\n2:28:30.940 --> 2:28:33.420\n it doesn't want to do it again.\n\n2:28:33.420 --> 2:28:37.060\n It's almost like this, okay, got it, stored, stored, right?\n\n2:28:37.060 --> 2:28:40.020\n And then it adds maybe some little levels of complexity to it,\n\n2:28:40.020 --> 2:28:41.380\n but it has to be something new,\n\n2:28:41.380 --> 2:28:43.100\n meaning the new level of complexity\n\n2:28:43.100 --> 2:28:45.740\n for it to even be willing to reconsider.\n\n2:28:45.740 --> 2:28:47.180\n Otherwise you have, so then all of a sudden\n\n2:28:47.180 --> 2:28:50.700\n what you have is these neurons in the back of your head,\n\n2:28:50.700 --> 2:28:53.420\n and they have created pathways, right?\n\n2:28:53.420 --> 2:28:56.540\n So, and every time neurons have created pathway\n\n2:28:56.540 --> 2:29:00.140\n among themselves, because basically they're attached,\n\n2:29:00.140 --> 2:29:01.380\n and here is the pathway,\n\n2:29:01.380 --> 2:29:03.620\n well, this pathway in the world of,\n\n2:29:03.620 --> 2:29:08.620\n in the world of science of bias, it's a habit.\n\n2:29:08.620 --> 2:29:10.620\n In general, it's a habit when they form two pathways,\n\n2:29:10.620 --> 2:29:12.180\n when they form a pathway, it's a habit.\n\n2:29:12.180 --> 2:29:16.140\n So if we're willing to talk about unconscious bias,\n\n2:29:16.140 --> 2:29:18.500\n because of course it's very different\n\n2:29:18.500 --> 2:29:20.900\n from somebody who tells me to my face,\n\n2:29:21.940 --> 2:29:26.220\n there's no world in which you or I could ever be equal,\n\n2:29:26.220 --> 2:29:27.540\n because you're black and I'm white,\n\n2:29:27.540 --> 2:29:30.460\n you're a woman, I'm a man, this, this and that,\n\n2:29:30.460 --> 2:29:35.460\n that people like that, again, 1% of psychopaths in our world,\n\n2:29:35.460 --> 2:29:37.100\n they're out there, unfortunately,\n\n2:29:37.100 --> 2:29:39.300\n by the time they do nasty things, it's pretty horrible,\n\n2:29:39.300 --> 2:29:41.100\n and that's what all we hear about,\n\n2:29:41.100 --> 2:29:42.860\n but I'm talking mostly about the rest of us.\n\n2:29:42.860 --> 2:29:45.340\n Remember when I told you that most of us are good people,\n\n2:29:45.340 --> 2:29:47.980\n bumbling along, making it up as we're going,\n\n2:29:47.980 --> 2:29:50.660\n and that's why I have compassion for human nature.\n\n2:29:50.660 --> 2:29:53.900\n So, but really, in the morning when I wake up,\n\n2:29:53.900 --> 2:29:55.700\n do you really think that I'm waking up and thinking,\n\n2:29:55.700 --> 2:29:56.700\n how am I gonna go kill?\n\n2:29:56.700 --> 2:29:57.540\n How am I gonna kill?\n\n2:29:57.540 --> 2:29:58.380\n How am I gonna kill?\n\n2:29:58.380 --> 2:30:00.540\n And I wake up and thinking, how am I gonna go kill?\n\n2:30:00.540 --> 2:30:01.860\n How am I gonna go kill Lex?\n\n2:30:01.860 --> 2:30:04.660\n That Lex guy needs to go down, he's a man, he's a,\n\n2:30:04.660 --> 2:30:05.860\n don't take me wrong, I'm sure there are some women\n\n2:30:05.860 --> 2:30:07.660\n who feel like that, but I'm not one of them,\n\n2:30:07.660 --> 2:30:10.500\n and I do think a majority of us are not, whatever.\n\n2:30:10.500 --> 2:30:11.620\n But you know, in the morning I'm waking up,\n\n2:30:11.620 --> 2:30:15.780\n I'm just like, gee, can I get my tea?\n\n2:30:16.780 --> 2:30:18.540\n Oh, my dog is not looking okay today.\n\n2:30:18.540 --> 2:30:22.420\n You know, we've got, right?\n\n2:30:22.420 --> 2:30:26.060\n It's a lot going on, and so you're using these kind of,\n\n2:30:26.060 --> 2:30:27.380\n just like you said, brilliantly,\n\n2:30:27.380 --> 2:30:30.220\n it has a bunch of simplifications that's built up,\n\n2:30:30.220 --> 2:30:32.820\n and it uses those simplifications to get through the day.\n\n2:30:32.820 --> 2:30:34.500\n To get through the day, exactly.\n\n2:30:34.500 --> 2:30:37.900\n So then here you are, needing to make sense of a world,\n\n2:30:37.900 --> 2:30:39.860\n and then the brain is your best ally in that.\n\n2:30:39.860 --> 2:30:41.420\n The way it's gonna do it is through efficiency,\n\n2:30:41.420 --> 2:30:43.340\n efficiency done through automation.\n\n2:30:43.340 --> 2:30:46.420\n So every time it thinks it's figured something out,\n\n2:30:46.420 --> 2:30:47.780\n it's never gonna think about it again,\n\n2:30:47.780 --> 2:30:49.780\n so that's how you build all of these habits\n\n2:30:49.780 --> 2:30:52.300\n of unconscious bias, because everything,\n\n2:30:52.300 --> 2:30:54.620\n so it's somewhere along the line,\n\n2:30:54.620 --> 2:30:58.500\n you come up with the information\n\n2:30:58.500 --> 2:31:01.660\n that black man walking around with a hoodie equals danger.\n\n2:31:01.660 --> 2:31:03.180\n So later, what do you see?\n\n2:31:04.900 --> 2:31:07.820\n Whether it's Lex or my gut, I'm walking in the dark alley,\n\n2:31:07.820 --> 2:31:09.140\n I see a black man with a hoodie,\n\n2:31:09.140 --> 2:31:10.060\n maybe I'm gonna run away\n\n2:31:10.060 --> 2:31:12.940\n because I've been given that information.\n\n2:31:12.940 --> 2:31:16.580\n So the best way to think about it is the brain is a hardware,\n\n2:31:16.580 --> 2:31:21.580\n and the software it runs on is, what do you call it?\n\n2:31:21.740 --> 2:31:24.380\n Is a cultural imprint.\n\n2:31:24.380 --> 2:31:26.060\n All of this information that we're getting\n\n2:31:26.060 --> 2:31:28.260\n from the Disney movies that you're reading,\n\n2:31:28.260 --> 2:31:30.860\n telling you that damsels are to be saved by the prince\n\n2:31:30.860 --> 2:31:34.420\n and all of that stuff, and girls wear pink and all, whatever.\n\n2:31:34.420 --> 2:31:36.300\n You watch the movies, and all the movies,\n\n2:31:36.300 --> 2:31:38.060\n whenever you watch images about Africa,\n\n2:31:38.060 --> 2:31:39.500\n they're talking to you about the blood diamonds,\n\n2:31:39.500 --> 2:31:40.740\n or they're talking to you about slavery,\n\n2:31:40.740 --> 2:31:41.580\n or they're talking to you about this,\n\n2:31:41.580 --> 2:31:42.860\n and then no wonder you walk away\n\n2:31:42.860 --> 2:31:44.900\n thinking that all the ills of Africa are caused\n\n2:31:44.900 --> 2:31:47.500\n because of resource extraction, the diamonds,\n\n2:31:47.500 --> 2:31:49.380\n or they're always fighting each other,\n\n2:31:49.380 --> 2:31:52.300\n look at Idi Amin in the movie,\n\n2:31:52.300 --> 2:31:56.660\n or slavery all the time, you walk away and this is it.\n\n2:31:56.660 --> 2:31:58.180\n And we all programmed along the same lines,\n\n2:31:58.180 --> 2:31:59.820\n see that's the beauty of it.\n\n2:31:59.820 --> 2:32:02.380\n All of us are, because even some black people\n\n2:32:02.380 --> 2:32:04.300\n who are gonna claim that they didn't visit up\n\n2:32:04.300 --> 2:32:06.620\n when they registered, really?\n\n2:32:06.620 --> 2:32:08.540\n So the truth, so then when I learned all of this,\n\n2:32:08.540 --> 2:32:11.300\n I'm like, wow, this concept of if you've got the brain,\n\n2:32:11.300 --> 2:32:14.620\n you've got biases, it comes with the territory,\n\n2:32:14.620 --> 2:32:15.700\n that makes sense.\n\n2:32:16.580 --> 2:32:19.860\n Now, it doesn't mean we can't transcend\n\n2:32:19.860 --> 2:32:22.820\n that function of a brain and that we should transcend it.\n\n2:32:24.780 --> 2:32:25.820\n But I think it's very important\n\n2:32:25.820 --> 2:32:27.700\n because once you understand that,\n\n2:32:27.700 --> 2:32:30.300\n a little bit more peace is created among us\n\n2:32:30.300 --> 2:32:32.020\n because this is not about a black and white,\n\n2:32:32.020 --> 2:32:34.020\n or a yellow and green issue,\n\n2:32:34.020 --> 2:32:36.900\n it's about we are human issue.\n\n2:32:36.900 --> 2:32:41.900\n And these are part of things we develop to stay around.\n\n2:32:42.980 --> 2:32:47.980\n Just like we no longer have to rely on this fear of flight,\n\n2:32:47.980 --> 2:32:52.660\n like ability of a brain because bears over there\n\n2:32:52.660 --> 2:32:54.860\n start running and running fast, right?\n\n2:32:54.860 --> 2:32:55.740\n Today, where are the bears?\n\n2:32:55.740 --> 2:32:56.820\n Show me where they are.\n\n2:32:56.820 --> 2:33:01.820\n But we have kept this tendency to go for fear of flight.\n\n2:33:02.420 --> 2:33:03.340\n I don't know how they say it.\n\n2:33:03.340 --> 2:33:07.740\n And so we have this courtesan done by the stress,\n\n2:33:07.740 --> 2:33:09.460\n stress triggers that back in the days,\n\n2:33:09.460 --> 2:33:11.540\n we have a stress trigger, we run,\n\n2:33:11.540 --> 2:33:14.140\n and it's all expelled out.\n\n2:33:14.140 --> 2:33:15.900\n But today we get triggers\n\n2:33:15.900 --> 2:33:17.140\n and we don't know what to do with it\n\n2:33:17.140 --> 2:33:18.860\n because where do we run to?\n\n2:33:18.860 --> 2:33:19.700\n What do we do?\n\n2:33:19.700 --> 2:33:21.620\n The bear is not even here.\n\n2:33:21.620 --> 2:33:23.340\n So same thing here with that.\n\n2:33:23.340 --> 2:33:25.860\n And so then you realize there's this whole thing\n\n2:33:25.860 --> 2:33:28.180\n that is now what you understand\n\n2:33:28.180 --> 2:33:31.900\n is that this problem is not about anti racism BS,\n\n2:33:31.900 --> 2:33:34.460\n but it is about can each one of us\n\n2:33:34.460 --> 2:33:36.420\n do the work where the work is needed,\n\n2:33:36.420 --> 2:33:38.540\n which is we look inside.\n\n2:33:38.540 --> 2:33:41.660\n Can we go for this work of deprogrammation?\n\n2:33:42.540 --> 2:33:45.340\n This concept of a mindful practice\n\n2:33:45.340 --> 2:33:49.500\n of undoing the habit of bias.\n\n2:33:49.500 --> 2:33:52.180\n And that doesn't necessarily have to do\n\n2:33:52.180 --> 2:33:55.420\n with a simple categorization of black and white.\n\n2:33:55.420 --> 2:33:56.420\n It's all kinds of biases.\n\n2:33:56.420 --> 2:33:57.380\n It's about everything.\n\n2:33:57.380 --> 2:33:58.860\n It's about everything.\n\n2:33:58.860 --> 2:34:00.980\n And when I started on that journey\n\n2:34:00.980 --> 2:34:03.820\n and my friend back then built this practice\n\n2:34:03.820 --> 2:34:06.540\n of undoing your habit of unconscious bias,\n\n2:34:08.500 --> 2:34:11.420\n we had all types of people come and say,\n\n2:34:11.420 --> 2:34:16.060\n wow, I discovered that my bias is against larger people.\n\n2:34:16.060 --> 2:34:17.980\n And I'm more like, what do you mean?\n\n2:34:17.980 --> 2:34:21.900\n Well, I think it seems to me like I felt\n\n2:34:21.900 --> 2:34:24.540\n that larger people maybe are dumb.\n\n2:34:24.540 --> 2:34:28.060\n No, we heard things and you don't judge.\n\n2:34:28.060 --> 2:34:28.900\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:28.900 --> 2:34:29.740\n You don't judge.\n\n2:34:29.740 --> 2:34:32.020\n And you see it's at every level.\n\n2:34:33.700 --> 2:34:35.740\n I don't know, like there's even this one friend,\n\n2:34:35.740 --> 2:34:37.700\n she was like, when I looked into the whole dating thing,\n\n2:34:37.700 --> 2:34:40.460\n I absolutely didn't want to date the Asian men\n\n2:34:40.460 --> 2:34:43.500\n because her mind was into some stereotypes\n\n2:34:43.500 --> 2:34:45.460\n about the size of whatever.\n\n2:34:45.460 --> 2:34:47.340\n And she was like, no.\n\n2:34:47.340 --> 2:34:50.060\n But you see, once you start,\n\n2:34:50.060 --> 2:34:51.420\n because there's this whole thing of,\n\n2:34:51.420 --> 2:34:54.180\n it's the five step thing, bias awareness.\n\n2:34:54.180 --> 2:34:57.260\n This, basically at this level,\n\n2:34:57.260 --> 2:34:59.900\n what you're doing is you're learning\n\n2:34:59.900 --> 2:35:02.060\n to spot the biases in our culture,\n\n2:35:02.060 --> 2:35:04.420\n because that's where the cultural imprint comes from.\n\n2:35:04.420 --> 2:35:05.900\n You're watching this movie and you're realizing,\n\n2:35:05.900 --> 2:35:08.340\n just like I said, wow, gee, I realized once again,\n\n2:35:08.340 --> 2:35:11.220\n the black person is portrayed like the fog of a movie.\n\n2:35:12.300 --> 2:35:15.300\n Or, you know, the Latina lady,\n\n2:35:15.300 --> 2:35:16.660\n this is how she's been portrayed.\n\n2:35:16.660 --> 2:35:17.540\n And you see it everywhere.\n\n2:35:17.540 --> 2:35:19.900\n Even the NPR, NPR is happening,\n\n2:35:19.900 --> 2:35:21.620\n like you're listening to something like NPR.\n\n2:35:21.620 --> 2:35:23.620\n It's gotta be more liberal than that.\n\n2:35:23.620 --> 2:35:26.140\n And this gentleman is asking these two candidates,\n\n2:35:26.140 --> 2:35:27.860\n one of them is a woman, political candidates,\n\n2:35:27.860 --> 2:35:29.060\n the other one is a man.\n\n2:35:29.060 --> 2:35:31.020\n I'm hearing him asking the lady a question\n\n2:35:31.020 --> 2:35:33.700\n that I know he's not gonna ask the man and he didn't ask her.\n\n2:35:33.700 --> 2:35:38.700\n He said, how do you balance your race with a family?\n\n2:35:40.140 --> 2:35:41.940\n Does a man not have a family?\n\n2:35:41.940 --> 2:35:46.100\n Right there, you see, it's very subtle.\n\n2:35:46.100 --> 2:35:48.980\n But you see, but because now my mind is kind of trained\n\n2:35:48.980 --> 2:35:51.220\n to see things, I'm like, interesting.\n\n2:35:51.220 --> 2:35:53.260\n Or like when the media just says,\n\n2:35:53.260 --> 2:35:57.620\n froze climate change issue on something\n\n2:35:57.620 --> 2:35:59.900\n without even the choice of words.\n\n2:35:59.900 --> 2:36:01.620\n So it's pretty much everywhere.\n\n2:36:01.620 --> 2:36:03.140\n You open a book everywhere.\n\n2:36:03.140 --> 2:36:05.020\n The interesting thing though,\n\n2:36:05.020 --> 2:36:08.260\n I mean, even that man, woman example,\n\n2:36:08.260 --> 2:36:11.860\n is I think it's really powerful\n\n2:36:11.860 --> 2:36:13.940\n to bring that bias to the surface,\n\n2:36:13.940 --> 2:36:18.500\n but not let that lead to kind of fear and paralysis.\n\n2:36:18.500 --> 2:36:20.940\n You should almost, I mean, that's where humor is,\n\n2:36:20.940 --> 2:36:23.300\n make fun of it, bring it to the surface,\n\n2:36:23.300 --> 2:36:25.740\n like acknowledge the fact that those things\n\n2:36:25.740 --> 2:36:27.140\n are a part of the conversation.\n\n2:36:27.140 --> 2:36:32.100\n And a lot of them are, it is, it's a cultural imprint\n\n2:36:32.100 --> 2:36:33.220\n because it's part of culture.\n\n2:36:33.220 --> 2:36:34.740\n And that might be, there could be,\n\n2:36:34.740 --> 2:36:36.620\n I grew up in the Soviet Union\n\n2:36:36.620 --> 2:36:40.260\n where the gender roles were stronger than in other places.\n\n2:36:40.260 --> 2:36:41.260\n And that's part of the culture.\n\n2:36:41.260 --> 2:36:44.340\n We have to acknowledge that this is how,\n\n2:36:44.340 --> 2:36:46.580\n this is affecting how I think.\n\n2:36:46.580 --> 2:36:49.100\n We might like how that works, we might not,\n\n2:36:49.100 --> 2:36:52.020\n but we have to acknowledge it and not get,\n\n2:36:52.020 --> 2:36:54.220\n make it part of humor, make fun of yourself,\n\n2:36:54.220 --> 2:36:55.460\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:36:55.460 --> 2:36:56.300\n That's the thing.\n\n2:36:56.300 --> 2:37:00.140\n And so that's why this first step is bias awareness.\n\n2:37:00.140 --> 2:37:02.300\n So you get, you train yourself, oh yeah, okay,\n\n2:37:02.300 --> 2:37:05.020\n that was one or it's, you know, and it's about,\n\n2:37:05.020 --> 2:37:07.180\n it's in you, we're talking about you, we're not.\n\n2:37:07.180 --> 2:37:11.500\n And then from there, you're like replace the bias,\n\n2:37:11.500 --> 2:37:12.660\n like bias replacement.\n\n2:37:13.940 --> 2:37:17.380\n Then it is where you practice the empathy.\n\n2:37:17.380 --> 2:37:19.700\n You're like, gee, wow, I wonder how I would feel\n\n2:37:19.700 --> 2:37:21.260\n every day I walk into a store\n\n2:37:21.260 --> 2:37:22.740\n and the guy thinks he should be following me\n\n2:37:22.740 --> 2:37:25.700\n because maybe I might steal something because I'm black.\n\n2:37:25.700 --> 2:37:27.180\n Because once you try that,\n\n2:37:27.180 --> 2:37:28.660\n to put yourself in the other person's shoes,\n\n2:37:28.660 --> 2:37:31.220\n all of a sudden something else starts to click.\n\n2:37:31.220 --> 2:37:35.220\n And then from there, you go on to making connection.\n\n2:37:36.220 --> 2:37:37.820\n Then you're making a connection\n\n2:37:37.820 --> 2:37:42.020\n and then things start to change because now you know,\n\n2:37:42.020 --> 2:37:45.140\n you're making, then you make cultural immersion.\n\n2:37:45.140 --> 2:37:47.100\n So this is where we had some people like this one woman,\n\n2:37:47.100 --> 2:37:51.540\n she was very quite, very feminist oriented.\n\n2:37:51.540 --> 2:37:56.020\n And she had an issue with women wearing the hijab.\n\n2:37:56.020 --> 2:37:58.060\n And because for her it was like, how come you,\n\n2:37:58.060 --> 2:38:02.340\n how come, how come you just lower, you know,\n\n2:38:02.340 --> 2:38:06.300\n like how come you're accepting this demeaning of yourself,\n\n2:38:06.300 --> 2:38:09.620\n not understanding everything else that comes with it.\n\n2:38:09.620 --> 2:38:13.580\n But through, as she understood that she even had that bias,\n\n2:38:13.580 --> 2:38:15.980\n then she went on through all the different processes.\n\n2:38:15.980 --> 2:38:18.220\n And then eventually when comes the next step,\n\n2:38:18.220 --> 2:38:21.740\n cultural immersion, she started going to the mosque\n\n2:38:21.740 --> 2:38:24.300\n during Ramadan when the Muslims are doing, you know,\n\n2:38:24.300 --> 2:38:27.020\n they're, it's the holy month of, you know, fasting\n\n2:38:27.020 --> 2:38:28.900\n and then we break at night.\n\n2:38:29.780 --> 2:38:32.340\n And she started understanding very different things.\n\n2:38:32.340 --> 2:38:35.740\n And eventually happens the last step that happens naturally,\n\n2:38:35.740 --> 2:38:38.820\n making a true, real, genuine connection.\n\n2:38:38.820 --> 2:38:40.740\n And this is where friendships happen.\n\n2:38:40.740 --> 2:38:43.220\n This is where that's it, your bias can go home now\n\n2:38:43.220 --> 2:38:46.220\n because it has been challenged with reality\n\n2:38:46.220 --> 2:38:47.380\n and understanding.\n\n2:38:47.380 --> 2:38:51.340\n And so for me, that is what I was after.\n\n2:38:51.340 --> 2:38:53.700\n And then, but then the world was just like,\n\n2:38:53.700 --> 2:38:55.820\n we don't want to be told we're part of a problem.\n\n2:38:55.820 --> 2:38:59.180\n So, but I still reckon that it is the type of mindfulness,\n\n2:38:59.180 --> 2:39:00.620\n type of practice that's going to need to happen.\n\n2:39:00.620 --> 2:39:04.180\n And it's one that's very internal to you.\n\n2:39:04.180 --> 2:39:08.580\n It is not, and it happens, everybody at their own pace.\n\n2:39:08.580 --> 2:39:13.580\n So all of this, I take it back to the racism,\n\n2:39:13.980 --> 2:39:15.580\n the question you were asking me.\n\n2:39:16.580 --> 2:39:17.420\n Does racism exist?\n\n2:39:17.420 --> 2:39:18.460\n Yes, it does.\n\n2:39:18.460 --> 2:39:20.260\n Is it going to stop me from doing anything I want to do?\n\n2:39:20.260 --> 2:39:21.100\n No.\n\n2:39:21.100 --> 2:39:21.940\n Is it going to make it harder?\n\n2:39:21.940 --> 2:39:22.900\n No.\n\n2:39:22.900 --> 2:39:27.420\n But this is where, for anybody who is serious\n\n2:39:27.420 --> 2:39:31.980\n about making sure, about fighting racism,\n\n2:39:33.860 --> 2:39:38.860\n I think the only job you have to do is to make sure\n\n2:39:39.060 --> 2:39:41.860\n that people keep their sense of self agency\n\n2:39:43.020 --> 2:39:46.300\n and B, can you help provide people with the tools\n\n2:39:47.340 --> 2:39:48.940\n to stand up?\n\n2:39:48.940 --> 2:39:52.500\n So this is why I have so much respect for Van Jones.\n\n2:39:52.500 --> 2:39:54.100\n People like Van Jones,\n\n2:39:54.100 --> 2:39:56.220\n although I disagree with him on so many things,\n\n2:39:56.220 --> 2:40:00.380\n but people like Ms. Alice Johnson,\n\n2:40:00.380 --> 2:40:02.980\n she was pardoned by President Trump\n\n2:40:02.980 --> 2:40:05.420\n through the work of people like Van Jones\n\n2:40:05.420 --> 2:40:08.060\n and Kim Kardashian and others.\n\n2:40:08.060 --> 2:40:09.700\n They all joined forces.\n\n2:40:09.700 --> 2:40:11.580\n This is a case where people of,\n\n2:40:11.580 --> 2:40:16.580\n and those folks then went on to combine forces furthermore,\n\n2:40:16.940 --> 2:40:21.140\n no regard given to their political belongings.\n\n2:40:21.140 --> 2:40:25.700\n They said, if the issue is criminal justice reform,\n\n2:40:25.700 --> 2:40:29.420\n then anybody who stands for it has to come together.\n\n2:40:29.420 --> 2:40:31.660\n And so what they did in this situation\n\n2:40:31.660 --> 2:40:34.740\n with what they're doing,\n\n2:40:34.740 --> 2:40:37.060\n criminal justice reform in my mind\n\n2:40:37.060 --> 2:40:42.060\n is a valid action to fight racism in my mind.\n\n2:40:43.540 --> 2:40:44.980\n Because what are you doing there?\n\n2:40:44.980 --> 2:40:47.020\n You're trying to get people out of jail\n\n2:40:47.020 --> 2:40:49.460\n who really have no business being there.\n\n2:40:49.460 --> 2:40:52.660\n And also when you have people like Bishop Omar\n\n2:40:52.660 --> 2:40:55.180\n and the people, he passed away, unfortunately,\n\n2:40:55.180 --> 2:40:57.860\n but today we have Anton Lucky,\n\n2:40:57.860 --> 2:41:01.860\n who was in jail for having killed his cousin.\n\n2:41:01.860 --> 2:41:04.300\n He had started,\n\n2:41:04.300 --> 2:41:08.900\n I think he started the gang in South Dallas.\n\n2:41:08.900 --> 2:41:10.340\n So we're talking really tough guy\n\n2:41:10.340 --> 2:41:13.340\n who was reading the wrong side of the equation.\n\n2:41:13.340 --> 2:41:16.580\n And then in jail, literally he found Plato,\n\n2:41:16.580 --> 2:41:17.860\n the cave and all that.\n\n2:41:17.860 --> 2:41:21.060\n So today these people, I'm like,\n\n2:41:21.060 --> 2:41:22.380\n why don't we hear more about them?\n\n2:41:22.380 --> 2:41:23.900\n The urban specialists.\n\n2:41:23.900 --> 2:41:25.260\n Because these people,\n\n2:41:25.260 --> 2:41:28.300\n it's not about the anti racism crap of Candy O'Donoghue,\n\n2:41:28.300 --> 2:41:30.620\n I'll say it again, until the cows come home,\n\n2:41:30.620 --> 2:41:33.220\n but it is about, we go where help is needed.\n\n2:41:33.220 --> 2:41:37.740\n We go in urban, inner city,\n\n2:41:37.740 --> 2:41:40.260\n inner city, black inner city neighborhoods\n\n2:41:40.260 --> 2:41:43.340\n and block by block we change the culture.\n\n2:41:43.340 --> 2:41:45.540\n And they say it like that, it's their words.\n\n2:41:45.540 --> 2:41:47.100\n These are African American people\n\n2:41:47.100 --> 2:41:48.700\n who have as many rights as anybody else\n\n2:41:48.700 --> 2:41:50.180\n to talk about their own culture.\n\n2:41:50.180 --> 2:41:53.740\n And they will tell you, we have to change the culture.\n\n2:41:53.740 --> 2:41:55.860\n I have some videos like that on my YouTube\n\n2:41:55.860 --> 2:41:57.580\n with Bishop Omar.\n\n2:41:57.580 --> 2:41:59.980\n What these people are doing is what we need to do.\n\n2:41:59.980 --> 2:42:01.220\n Bishop will explain and say,\n\n2:42:01.220 --> 2:42:05.020\n sometimes people are their feet and feet\n\n2:42:05.020 --> 2:42:06.460\n deep down in the mud.\n\n2:42:07.340 --> 2:42:11.260\n And what we have to do is to try to pull them up.\n\n2:42:11.260 --> 2:42:13.540\n And you cannot say you didn't pull them up\n\n2:42:13.540 --> 2:42:15.300\n because we're not seeing their head out yet,\n\n2:42:15.300 --> 2:42:18.580\n but how much progress have they made from the bottom\n\n2:42:18.580 --> 2:42:22.180\n to where they are now and keep going.\n\n2:42:22.180 --> 2:42:24.500\n So what I see these people doing,\n\n2:42:24.500 --> 2:42:26.340\n you see, I have so much,\n\n2:42:26.340 --> 2:42:29.340\n I love and respect Glen Lowry and company,\n\n2:42:29.340 --> 2:42:30.660\n and Ian Rove and all of those guys.\n\n2:42:30.660 --> 2:42:31.620\n I love them.\n\n2:42:31.620 --> 2:42:34.220\n I love a lot of the things that they say.\n\n2:42:36.220 --> 2:42:37.700\n This whole concept of personal responsibility,\n\n2:42:37.700 --> 2:42:38.900\n we don't know that.\n\n2:42:38.900 --> 2:42:40.300\n But I'm just like, at some point,\n\n2:42:40.300 --> 2:42:43.740\n it also needs to be matched up with real actions.\n\n2:42:43.740 --> 2:42:46.700\n And that's what the people like Anton Lucky,\n\n2:42:46.700 --> 2:42:50.100\n urban specialist, Alice Johnson are doing.\n\n2:42:50.100 --> 2:42:51.180\n They're going where it's hard.\n\n2:42:51.180 --> 2:42:52.820\n Alice Johnson is getting people out of jail\n\n2:42:52.820 --> 2:42:54.820\n every single day, literally.\n\n2:42:54.820 --> 2:42:57.420\n And then people like Anton Lucky and his team\n\n2:42:57.420 --> 2:43:01.100\n are giving them the tools to live the gang life,\n\n2:43:01.100 --> 2:43:05.260\n to be better people, to go for a life of redemption.\n\n2:43:05.260 --> 2:43:07.100\n This is happening right now.\n\n2:43:07.100 --> 2:43:08.580\n But what I find is they're not getting\n\n2:43:08.580 --> 2:43:10.260\n the bulk of the attention.\n\n2:43:10.260 --> 2:43:14.420\n But anybody who's serious about this is why,\n\n2:43:14.420 --> 2:43:17.300\n how I would love to see people do anti racism\n\n2:43:17.300 --> 2:43:21.460\n is help lift people up for real.\n\n2:43:21.460 --> 2:43:22.300\n Action.\n\n2:43:22.300 --> 2:43:25.940\n Support school choice.\n\n2:43:26.980 --> 2:43:28.140\n Support school choice.\n\n2:43:28.140 --> 2:43:30.820\n Black mamas, they know what's going on.\n\n2:43:30.820 --> 2:43:32.860\n And when they tell you we want school choice,\n\n2:43:32.860 --> 2:43:33.700\n they know what to talk about.\n\n2:43:33.700 --> 2:43:35.420\n They're not idiots.\n\n2:43:35.420 --> 2:43:36.940\n Especially at the local level.\n\n2:43:36.940 --> 2:43:37.780\n Yes.\n\n2:43:37.780 --> 2:43:38.820\n Helping them at the local level.\n\n2:43:38.820 --> 2:43:39.660\n Yes.\n\n2:43:39.660 --> 2:43:42.780\n So help them make sure that they can take their kids\n\n2:43:42.780 --> 2:43:45.900\n out of these public schools that are doing\n\n2:43:45.900 --> 2:43:47.580\n horrendous things to them.\n\n2:43:47.580 --> 2:43:50.380\n You know, Miss Virginia, watch that movie.\n\n2:43:50.380 --> 2:43:55.100\n How could you not support black moms in this country\n\n2:43:55.100 --> 2:43:57.580\n to take the kids to safety when it comes to education?\n\n2:43:57.580 --> 2:43:59.060\n How come not?\n\n2:43:59.060 --> 2:44:00.780\n That's what I want to see happen.\n\n2:44:00.780 --> 2:44:04.500\n And not like some, yeah, let's go to some classrooms\n\n2:44:04.500 --> 2:44:05.740\n and everybody's white.\n\n2:44:05.740 --> 2:44:06.660\n You go over here.\n\n2:44:06.660 --> 2:44:07.900\n Everybody's a next date.\n\n2:44:07.900 --> 2:44:08.900\n You go over here.\n\n2:44:08.900 --> 2:44:10.580\n And kids, let us tell you about this.\n\n2:44:10.580 --> 2:44:13.220\n No, no, no, no.\n\n2:44:13.220 --> 2:44:15.860\n As a black person, I don't want you to do any of that crap.\n\n2:44:17.500 --> 2:44:19.460\n Let me grow my wings.\n\n2:44:19.460 --> 2:44:20.300\n Yeah.\n\n2:44:20.300 --> 2:44:22.180\n If you want, help put some fuel behind them\n\n2:44:22.180 --> 2:44:23.500\n and let me take my flight.\n\n2:44:23.500 --> 2:44:24.740\n That's all I'm asking for.\n\n2:44:24.740 --> 2:44:29.740\n That's the only way for you to be part of a racism battle\n\n2:44:30.380 --> 2:44:32.140\n if that's what you think is the most important battle\n\n2:44:32.140 --> 2:44:33.380\n of our life.\n\n2:44:33.380 --> 2:44:34.220\n That's it.\n\n2:44:34.220 --> 2:44:35.340\n That's what I have to say about that.\n\n2:44:35.340 --> 2:44:37.580\n And so for me, I'm keeping my head very straight.\n\n2:44:37.580 --> 2:44:42.580\n It's about what enables black people to thrive.\n\n2:44:45.300 --> 2:44:48.980\n I don't need for you to be an activist on my behalf.\n\n2:44:48.980 --> 2:44:50.380\n No, because when you're doing that,\n\n2:44:50.380 --> 2:44:52.740\n you're doing exactly what you've been doing to us\n\n2:44:52.740 --> 2:44:55.140\n black people in Africa our whole life.\n\n2:44:55.140 --> 2:44:56.900\n I don't need your white savior complex\n\n2:44:56.900 --> 2:44:58.380\n because that's what anti racism is.\n\n2:44:58.380 --> 2:44:59.340\n White savior complex.\n\n2:44:59.340 --> 2:45:00.620\n That stuff doesn't work.\n\n2:45:00.620 --> 2:45:02.620\n It only works to make you feel better\n\n2:45:02.620 --> 2:45:04.340\n about how superior you are to me.\n\n2:45:04.340 --> 2:45:06.980\n But it does nothing, absolutely nothing\n\n2:45:06.980 --> 2:45:08.380\n to change my everyday life.\n\n2:45:08.380 --> 2:45:11.220\n If it is not, if it is at least in the African side\n\n2:45:11.220 --> 2:45:13.580\n to actually even change my,\n\n2:45:14.740 --> 2:45:17.500\n turn me into somebody who's waiting for handouts.\n\n2:45:17.500 --> 2:45:20.780\n So I would encourage people to really,\n\n2:45:20.780 --> 2:45:22.980\n those people who are really serious\n\n2:45:22.980 --> 2:45:24.540\n about wanting to be part of a solution.\n\n2:45:24.540 --> 2:45:26.420\n And I know there are many out there\n\n2:45:26.420 --> 2:45:28.460\n for the love of God and everything that's out there\n\n2:45:28.460 --> 2:45:31.460\n and we care about, stop.\n\n2:45:31.460 --> 2:45:36.460\n It's about, think about what's gonna enable people.\n\n2:45:39.100 --> 2:45:40.620\n Maybe the word is wrongly chosen,\n\n2:45:40.620 --> 2:45:42.300\n but know what I'm talking about.\n\n2:45:42.300 --> 2:45:44.940\n Give them the freedom to spread their wings.\n\n2:45:44.940 --> 2:45:49.020\n Yes, give a person, teach a person how to fish\n\n2:45:49.020 --> 2:45:50.660\n and don't give them a fish.\n\n2:45:50.660 --> 2:45:53.020\n When you're putting your stupid signs on the lawn\n\n2:45:53.020 --> 2:45:55.020\n with Black Lives Matter and all that crap,\n\n2:45:55.020 --> 2:45:55.980\n you're not helping.\n\n2:45:55.980 --> 2:45:58.420\n And when you're buying one more anti racism book\n\n2:45:58.420 --> 2:46:02.860\n or as a company, financing one more DEI,\n\n2:46:04.060 --> 2:46:06.940\n if it done along those lines, I think we've got a problem.\n\n2:46:06.940 --> 2:46:07.780\n Yeah.\n\n2:46:07.780 --> 2:46:11.980\n So you do think that the efforts of diversity,\n\n2:46:11.980 --> 2:46:16.220\n equity and inclusion are often not effective.\n\n2:46:16.220 --> 2:46:17.300\n Not only are they not effective,\n\n2:46:17.300 --> 2:46:20.380\n but they also backfire and there are reports on all of this.\n\n2:46:22.700 --> 2:46:25.420\n And at the end of the day, it makes sense.\n\n2:46:25.420 --> 2:46:26.740\n It makes sense.\n\n2:46:26.740 --> 2:46:29.700\n So for me, I am very, very glad\n\n2:46:29.700 --> 2:46:34.140\n that people have developed an enlightenment about this.\n\n2:46:35.140 --> 2:46:37.540\n Very happy about that, very.\n\n2:46:37.540 --> 2:46:39.420\n But let us not keep going\n\n2:46:39.420 --> 2:46:44.100\n for the easy perceived solution to problems.\n\n2:46:44.100 --> 2:46:47.900\n Again, they've done this to us, the poor people of Africa.\n\n2:46:47.900 --> 2:46:51.860\n They thought the solution was to give.\n\n2:46:51.860 --> 2:46:53.900\n It does not work.\n\n2:46:53.900 --> 2:46:58.900\n And then they say, oh, we're gonna do social entrepreneurship\n\n2:46:59.020 --> 2:47:00.740\n on you, Tom shoes, buy one pair of shoes\n\n2:47:00.740 --> 2:47:01.980\n and we give one pair of shoes\n\n2:47:01.980 --> 2:47:04.540\n to some people in poor countries.\n\n2:47:04.540 --> 2:47:06.140\n Then guess what happened to us?\n\n2:47:07.180 --> 2:47:09.300\n You know, in the town where we operate in Senegal,\n\n2:47:09.300 --> 2:47:11.100\n where I have my little manufacturing,\n\n2:47:12.660 --> 2:47:15.940\n we have 2000 little mom and pop businesses.\n\n2:47:15.940 --> 2:47:18.620\n And guess what they happen to be in Lex?\n\n2:47:18.620 --> 2:47:21.340\n Shoemakers, right?\n\n2:47:21.340 --> 2:47:24.180\n So every shoemakers, each one of them hires\n\n2:47:24.180 --> 2:47:26.180\n at least five, 15 people.\n\n2:47:26.180 --> 2:47:29.300\n Do the math, family businesses.\n\n2:47:30.580 --> 2:47:34.420\n Guess what happens to them the day the Tom shoes truck\n\n2:47:34.420 --> 2:47:36.580\n shows up with bunch of free shoes.\n\n2:47:39.140 --> 2:47:39.980\n Yeah.\n\n2:47:39.980 --> 2:47:42.260\n Who can compete against free?\n\n2:47:42.260 --> 2:47:43.620\n Now, all of these people,\n\n2:47:43.620 --> 2:47:45.260\n little by little gonna have to close their shops\n\n2:47:45.260 --> 2:47:46.740\n because who can compete against free\n\n2:47:46.740 --> 2:47:49.620\n because Tom shoes dumping all of his shoes on them.\n\n2:47:49.620 --> 2:47:50.540\n And then they go out of business\n\n2:47:50.540 --> 2:47:53.220\n and now instead of helping anybody,\n\n2:47:53.220 --> 2:47:54.980\n you actually sent all the kids\n\n2:47:54.980 --> 2:47:59.020\n who depended on these adults working in these places.\n\n2:47:59.020 --> 2:48:00.460\n Now they have to join the rank of kids\n\n2:48:00.460 --> 2:48:01.820\n who need to be given shoes\n\n2:48:01.820 --> 2:48:05.780\n because you took their parents ability\n\n2:48:05.780 --> 2:48:10.420\n to make money through their wages, buy them shoes.\n\n2:48:11.460 --> 2:48:12.300\n You see?\n\n2:48:12.300 --> 2:48:14.140\n So first they said, we just have to give.\n\n2:48:14.140 --> 2:48:19.100\n So that was primarily, you know, the charity business.\n\n2:48:19.100 --> 2:48:22.620\n And you still have foreign aid business going on.\n\n2:48:22.620 --> 2:48:24.380\n So we just need to give.\n\n2:48:24.380 --> 2:48:27.460\n And then the social entrepreneurs came in place,\n\n2:48:27.460 --> 2:48:29.780\n but I'm like, the only person for this business is good\n\n2:48:29.780 --> 2:48:32.700\n is for Blake McCarthy, you know, the founder of Tom shoes.\n\n2:48:32.700 --> 2:48:34.820\n But other than that, I'm not sure really seeing\n\n2:48:34.820 --> 2:48:36.580\n who else is winning from this.\n\n2:48:36.580 --> 2:48:39.660\n And then they, and so today my whole thing is\n\n2:48:41.100 --> 2:48:46.100\n we got a challenge to have a mind for the poor\n\n2:48:46.100 --> 2:48:49.060\n or to have a mind for the lesser fortunate,\n\n2:48:49.060 --> 2:48:52.260\n maybe in this country, it is easy.\n\n2:48:52.260 --> 2:48:53.980\n And lesser fortunate, you know,\n\n2:48:53.980 --> 2:48:57.180\n for anybody that you feel like is being trampled upon\n\n2:48:57.180 --> 2:48:58.100\n because of something,\n\n2:48:58.100 --> 2:49:00.660\n maybe it's because of economic circumstances,\n\n2:49:00.660 --> 2:49:02.740\n or maybe it's race in this case, whatever.\n\n2:49:04.540 --> 2:49:08.100\n To have a heart for the lesser fortunate among us,\n\n2:49:08.100 --> 2:49:12.580\n for whatever reason, that's easy.\n\n2:49:12.580 --> 2:49:16.860\n But to have a mind for them, that's the challenge.\n\n2:49:16.860 --> 2:49:18.540\n Let me ask you a difficult question.\n\n2:49:18.540 --> 2:49:19.500\n Yeah.\n\n2:49:19.500 --> 2:49:22.700\n As if we were not already asking difficult questions.\n\n2:49:22.700 --> 2:49:26.620\n The president of Senegal, Macky Saw,\n\n2:49:26.620 --> 2:49:29.820\n is also now the chair of the African Union.\n\n2:49:29.820 --> 2:49:34.340\n He met with the president of Vladimir Putin on June 3rd.\n\n2:49:35.180 --> 2:49:40.300\n I think primarily was to discuss food security.\n\n2:49:40.300 --> 2:49:45.300\n Africa seems to be split halfway on their perspective\n\n2:49:45.380 --> 2:49:46.820\n in the war in Ukraine.\n\n2:49:46.820 --> 2:49:50.620\n So broadly speaking, what do you think about this?\n\n2:49:51.620 --> 2:49:53.700\n First of all, the geopolitics of Africa\n\n2:49:54.700 --> 2:49:58.260\n and the geopolitical relationship of Africa\n\n2:49:58.260 --> 2:50:01.780\n with the rest of the world and this current conflict\n\n2:50:03.340 --> 2:50:05.420\n with the war in Ukraine.\n\n2:50:05.420 --> 2:50:06.980\n What are your thoughts there?\n\n2:50:06.980 --> 2:50:09.500\n Well, you've seen that many countries\n\n2:50:09.500 --> 2:50:12.980\n when it was time to vote, some of them abstained,\n\n2:50:12.980 --> 2:50:15.580\n which in a way says something.\n\n2:50:15.580 --> 2:50:17.780\n I think for the Africans today,\n\n2:50:17.780 --> 2:50:20.100\n especially as represented by the African Union,\n\n2:50:20.100 --> 2:50:22.900\n because not all countries fall along the same lines,\n\n2:50:23.980 --> 2:50:27.100\n I feel like, again, we're back to way back.\n\n2:50:27.100 --> 2:50:30.860\n For the longest time, the West tries to tell us what to do.\n\n2:50:30.860 --> 2:50:32.780\n They decide for us.\n\n2:50:32.780 --> 2:50:37.420\n And here, there's trouble,\n\n2:50:37.420 --> 2:50:42.300\n meaning there's definitely a rift, major one,\n\n2:50:42.300 --> 2:50:44.300\n between most of the Western world\n\n2:50:44.300 --> 2:50:48.020\n as represented by Europe and America primarily,\n\n2:50:48.020 --> 2:50:49.820\n and you have Australia and all that.\n\n2:50:50.980 --> 2:50:53.140\n And then they're saying,\n\n2:50:54.900 --> 2:50:56.900\n I think this is more or less an attempt\n\n2:50:56.900 --> 2:51:01.900\n to stand on their own as well.\n\n2:51:03.220 --> 2:51:07.220\n It's like, don't tell us what to do as usual.\n\n2:51:07.220 --> 2:51:09.700\n You always rope us in with, when it makes sense for you,\n\n2:51:09.700 --> 2:51:10.820\n you try to rope us in,\n\n2:51:10.820 --> 2:51:13.020\n and then we're left hanging on our own.\n\n2:51:13.020 --> 2:51:15.020\n So this goes back to the sentiment\n\n2:51:15.020 --> 2:51:16.820\n you were talking about earlier.\n\n2:51:16.820 --> 2:51:21.820\n It's been challenging for me to watch this\n\n2:51:22.500 --> 2:51:26.500\n because remember, I have one foot also,\n\n2:51:26.500 --> 2:51:28.700\n because there's what I get to see and hear\n\n2:51:29.660 --> 2:51:31.860\n from being in the Western world,\n\n2:51:31.860 --> 2:51:34.260\n but there's also what I get to see and hear\n\n2:51:34.260 --> 2:51:37.060\n from when I'm back home.\n\n2:51:37.060 --> 2:51:38.740\n So I wear all hats.\n\n2:51:39.660 --> 2:51:41.700\n And I think this is a situation\n\n2:51:41.700 --> 2:51:46.700\n where the African Union and African nations in general\n\n2:51:47.540 --> 2:51:52.540\n are saying, this is a case where almost like,\n\n2:51:52.740 --> 2:51:56.580\n you guys are fighting, you guys are fighting.\n\n2:51:56.580 --> 2:51:59.500\n Maybe for once, we have to watch out for ourselves.\n\n2:51:59.500 --> 2:52:04.500\n Yeah, there's a sense in which this is the embodiment\n\n2:52:04.500 --> 2:52:08.380\n sort of abstaining from a vote on the war in Ukraine\n\n2:52:09.700 --> 2:52:12.980\n is a political embodiment of a resistance\n\n2:52:12.980 --> 2:52:14.900\n to the influence of the West.\n\n2:52:14.900 --> 2:52:16.860\n It's not about the war between,\n\n2:52:16.860 --> 2:52:18.460\n whatever you guys are fighting.\n\n2:52:18.460 --> 2:52:23.460\n It's saying, we're not going to let this particular empire\n\n2:52:24.940 --> 2:52:26.940\n that seems to be at the top right now,\n\n2:52:26.940 --> 2:52:29.460\n which is the United States empire in Europe,\n\n2:52:30.340 --> 2:52:33.780\n to dominate our political discourse,\n\n2:52:33.780 --> 2:52:36.580\n our geopolitical considerations.\n\n2:52:36.580 --> 2:52:38.940\n It's almost like, no, we're not touching this.\n\n2:52:38.940 --> 2:52:40.820\n Yeah, especially that given usually.\n\n2:52:40.820 --> 2:52:43.860\n So when they need us, again, for influence,\n\n2:52:43.860 --> 2:52:45.260\n which means more power,\n\n2:52:45.260 --> 2:52:47.740\n oh, you guys vote the same way we do.\n\n2:52:47.740 --> 2:52:52.740\n And when it's all over and they go back to spreading,\n\n2:52:52.900 --> 2:52:54.420\n they go back to, how do you say that?\n\n2:52:54.420 --> 2:52:59.180\n They go back to exchanging and sharing between themselves\n\n2:52:59.180 --> 2:53:03.900\n the goodies of their Halloween collection.\n\n2:53:03.900 --> 2:53:05.380\n We're no longer, we're not there\n\n2:53:05.380 --> 2:53:07.580\n when the goodies are being shared.\n\n2:53:07.580 --> 2:53:11.540\n So I think it's definitely one of those situations.\n\n2:53:11.540 --> 2:53:14.540\n But for me, it still is hard\n\n2:53:14.540 --> 2:53:17.020\n because I watch everything that's going on\n\n2:53:18.460 --> 2:53:23.260\n and it's going to be complicated,\n\n2:53:23.260 --> 2:53:25.260\n the ramifications of all of this.\n\n2:53:25.260 --> 2:53:28.660\n I would like to see our African leaders also,\n\n2:53:28.660 --> 2:53:30.500\n what they're doing is clear,\n\n2:53:30.500 --> 2:53:33.980\n but this is a place where I'm also tempted to say,\n\n2:53:35.820 --> 2:53:36.660\n yes and.\n\n2:53:39.340 --> 2:53:42.380\n Yes to the reasons you're advancing right now,\n\n2:53:44.180 --> 2:53:47.220\n we don't want to be always siding because we're tired.\n\n2:53:47.220 --> 2:53:49.460\n We're tired of always being dragged around\n\n2:53:49.460 --> 2:53:51.940\n and taken for granted and you vote our way.\n\n2:53:53.020 --> 2:53:55.580\n Come on guys, when you need us,\n\n2:53:55.580 --> 2:53:57.260\n we're great and everything is good.\n\n2:53:57.260 --> 2:53:59.660\n And then when it's time to go and share the goodies,\n\n2:53:59.660 --> 2:54:01.180\n we don't exist anymore.\n\n2:54:01.180 --> 2:54:04.580\n And you actually go for policies that go against us.\n\n2:54:04.580 --> 2:54:06.420\n But in this situation though,\n\n2:54:07.260 --> 2:54:09.820\n I would like to still see us do the right thing.\n\n2:54:09.820 --> 2:54:14.820\n In my case, I was not very happy to see us going\n\n2:54:15.260 --> 2:54:17.340\n and more or less begging for,\n\n2:54:20.180 --> 2:54:21.300\n what do you call it?\n\n2:54:21.300 --> 2:54:26.180\n Cereals, oh, please let the cereals make it.\n\n2:54:26.180 --> 2:54:29.180\n So at least we get them and we don't starve.\n\n2:54:29.180 --> 2:54:32.660\n I can understand why a president would say something\n\n2:54:32.660 --> 2:54:35.460\n like that or try to negotiate something like that.\n\n2:54:36.500 --> 2:54:41.300\n But when it comes to an African president having to do that\n\n2:54:41.300 --> 2:54:45.380\n with a non African president, I'm sorry,\n\n2:54:45.380 --> 2:54:47.860\n but for me, it's too close to begging.\n\n2:54:47.860 --> 2:54:49.180\n Listen, it's hard to be a leader,\n\n2:54:49.180 --> 2:54:52.180\n it's such a difficult dance because in some sense,\n\n2:54:52.180 --> 2:54:57.180\n sort of the flip side of that is you're creating a market,\n\n2:54:59.620 --> 2:55:01.740\n a geopolitical market of saying,\n\n2:55:01.740 --> 2:55:05.460\n we're willing to sit down at the table with America,\n\n2:55:05.460 --> 2:55:10.460\n with European leaders, with Russian leaders, with China,\n\n2:55:10.900 --> 2:55:13.940\n and we're gonna let you guys convince us\n\n2:55:13.940 --> 2:55:17.140\n who we should collaborate with.\n\n2:55:17.140 --> 2:55:21.740\n And that's what sort of great nations\n\n2:55:21.740 --> 2:55:23.580\n and groups of nations do.\n\n2:55:23.580 --> 2:55:25.580\n Now, there's a cynical, of course,\n\n2:55:25.580 --> 2:55:29.860\n a dark perspective on that because what's in that game\n\n2:55:29.860 --> 2:55:32.260\n played by leaders, the people that hurt,\n\n2:55:32.260 --> 2:55:36.420\n people of Ukraine hurt, people of Africa can hurt.\n\n2:55:36.420 --> 2:55:37.340\n People of Russia.\n\n2:55:37.340 --> 2:55:40.140\n People of Russia can hurt, people of China,\n\n2:55:40.140 --> 2:55:44.940\n people of United States, but it is the way of the world.\n\n2:55:44.940 --> 2:55:49.020\n And to earn, you have to earn respect\n\n2:55:49.020 --> 2:55:52.300\n and sometimes earning respect leads to the suffering\n\n2:55:52.300 --> 2:55:53.140\n of many.\n\n2:55:53.140 --> 2:55:56.140\n Well, but except in this case, yes to all of that.\n\n2:55:56.140 --> 2:55:59.820\n And the reason why I'm actually upset\n\n2:55:59.820 --> 2:56:02.780\n with going and being like, oh, can you let at least\n\n2:56:02.780 --> 2:56:05.100\n the boats that are supposed to come to Africa\n\n2:56:05.100 --> 2:56:08.100\n full of cereals come over, the wheat and all that?\n\n2:56:08.100 --> 2:56:11.540\n It's just like, look, Africa has the highest land\n\n2:56:11.540 --> 2:56:13.220\n that you can do agriculture on.\n\n2:56:13.220 --> 2:56:14.060\n Yes.\n\n2:56:14.060 --> 2:56:14.900\n You know?\n\n2:56:14.900 --> 2:56:19.100\n We have a larger surface, such surface in the world.\n\n2:56:19.100 --> 2:56:21.500\n Why is this not a time for us to try\n\n2:56:21.500 --> 2:56:24.420\n to win ourselves off of cereals that we don't necessarily\n\n2:56:24.420 --> 2:56:26.420\n have on the ground?\n\n2:56:26.420 --> 2:56:30.180\n But no, let us go and plead.\n\n2:56:30.180 --> 2:56:31.900\n Don't beg, create instead.\n\n2:56:31.900 --> 2:56:33.340\n Create instead, exactly.\n\n2:56:33.340 --> 2:56:35.220\n This should have been, you know, just like how\n\n2:56:35.220 --> 2:56:38.020\n the rest of the world when COVID happened\n\n2:56:38.020 --> 2:56:40.300\n and China had to close off for different reasons\n\n2:56:40.300 --> 2:56:42.620\n and since then has not, you know, completely reopened\n\n2:56:42.620 --> 2:56:44.940\n and people have started to realize, wow,\n\n2:56:44.940 --> 2:56:48.660\n we've got too much, we're too dependent on China\n\n2:56:48.660 --> 2:56:50.620\n for a lot of what we need.\n\n2:56:50.620 --> 2:56:53.060\n So we're gonna have to bring back some production\n\n2:56:53.060 --> 2:56:56.220\n to the US, the Europeans are doing the same, all of that.\n\n2:56:56.220 --> 2:56:59.300\n This should have been a time for African leaders\n\n2:56:59.300 --> 2:57:02.100\n to be like, we need to be serious now\n\n2:57:02.100 --> 2:57:05.860\n about, you know, food security.\n\n2:57:05.860 --> 2:57:08.380\n And maybe the stuff that maybe don't grow\n\n2:57:08.380 --> 2:57:10.140\n under our climates necessarily,\n\n2:57:10.140 --> 2:57:12.500\n can we work on coming up with different things?\n\n2:57:12.500 --> 2:57:14.540\n Now I understand that it can take time,\n\n2:57:14.540 --> 2:57:17.540\n but if I knew that that was happening at the same time\n\n2:57:17.540 --> 2:57:20.260\n that we're saying, oh, well, let the cereals come in,\n\n2:57:20.260 --> 2:57:22.260\n maybe I would be a little bit easier with it.\n\n2:57:22.260 --> 2:57:23.740\n But right now I'm just like,\n\n2:57:23.740 --> 2:57:25.580\n is it gonna be the same business as usual?\n\n2:57:25.580 --> 2:57:27.660\n And in this case, I'm just like, are we gonna go,\n\n2:57:27.660 --> 2:57:30.980\n are we gonna keep going from one masa to another masa?\n\n2:57:30.980 --> 2:57:31.820\n I mean, really?\n\n2:57:32.820 --> 2:57:35.100\n The interesting aspect of all of this\n\n2:57:35.100 --> 2:57:37.020\n is if we look at all of human history,\n\n2:57:37.020 --> 2:57:40.380\n it's possible that the 21st century is defined by Africa.\n\n2:57:40.380 --> 2:57:41.820\n It will be.\n\n2:57:41.820 --> 2:57:45.620\n And the young people, the huge number of young people,\n\n2:57:45.620 --> 2:57:47.300\n it's like the trajectory could be,\n\n2:57:47.300 --> 2:57:49.660\n there's so much possibility to define\n\n2:57:49.660 --> 2:57:52.540\n the future of human civilization in Africa.\n\n2:57:52.540 --> 2:57:55.460\n And I don't mean sort of in the next 10 years,\n\n2:57:55.460 --> 2:57:57.460\n I mean in the next 50 years.\n\n2:57:59.380 --> 2:58:03.260\n So some people are concerned about overpopulation.\n\n2:58:03.260 --> 2:58:06.460\n Some people are concerned about us dying out\n\n2:58:06.460 --> 2:58:07.740\n as a human species.\n\n2:58:07.740 --> 2:58:12.260\n And both of those people live in us.\n\n2:58:12.260 --> 2:58:13.460\n Talk to me often about that.\n\n2:58:13.460 --> 2:58:18.460\n I know, I know, I know, I know who they are.\n\n2:58:19.300 --> 2:58:22.700\n What's your, in Africa is at the center of this\n\n2:58:22.700 --> 2:58:26.420\n because there is a vibrant, huge number,\n\n2:58:26.420 --> 2:58:28.820\n probably over a billion people.\n\n2:58:28.820 --> 2:58:30.540\n Yeah, we're 1.3 billion people\n\n2:58:30.540 --> 2:58:33.460\n and of those, one billion blacks.\n\n2:58:33.460 --> 2:58:36.740\n I mean that, where do you land on that?\n\n2:58:36.740 --> 2:58:41.740\n There is a reason why I say I'm haunted,\n\n2:58:41.860 --> 2:58:45.500\n that I'm obsessed, that I'm monomaniacal\n\n2:58:45.500 --> 2:58:47.300\n when it comes to the free markets\n\n2:58:47.300 --> 2:58:50.260\n and that I have such a strong sense of urgency\n\n2:58:50.260 --> 2:58:53.660\n to the point that literally it is affecting me.\n\n2:58:53.660 --> 2:58:56.060\n And it has to do with the fact that yes,\n\n2:58:56.060 --> 2:58:58.500\n you have the youngest region on earth\n\n2:58:58.500 --> 2:59:01.340\n in terms of the age of its population\n\n2:59:01.340 --> 2:59:06.900\n and the rate at which it's growing demographic wise,\n\n2:59:06.900 --> 2:59:10.100\n I am not willing to stay there and say,\n\n2:59:10.100 --> 2:59:12.340\n it's a curse for humanity,\n\n2:59:12.340 --> 2:59:15.020\n but it will be a curse for humanity\n\n2:59:15.020 --> 2:59:20.460\n if we don't make sure that these people,\n\n2:59:20.460 --> 2:59:25.980\n our youth gets to partake.\n\n2:59:25.980 --> 2:59:29.020\n And what it takes to partake is not much.\n\n2:59:29.020 --> 2:59:31.580\n So if the rest of the world thinks that\n\n2:59:31.580 --> 2:59:35.060\n get to partake means you have to send more foreign aid,\n\n2:59:35.060 --> 2:59:38.740\n you have to have more charity businesses,\n\n2:59:38.740 --> 2:59:42.500\n I mean charity organizations sending stuff away,\n\n2:59:42.500 --> 2:59:46.660\n of course, you're almost thinking parasites.\n\n2:59:46.660 --> 2:59:48.180\n I'm sorry to say it this way,\n\n2:59:48.180 --> 2:59:49.980\n if this is what you're thinking,\n\n2:59:49.980 --> 2:59:52.980\n you're seeing us as no more than parasites.\n\n2:59:52.980 --> 2:59:55.780\n And if that's what it's gonna be,\n\n2:59:55.780 --> 2:59:59.380\n I could see why some people might be worried about that.\n\n2:59:59.380 --> 3:00:04.260\n Although humans should never be seen as parasites,\n\n3:00:04.260 --> 3:00:07.500\n no matter, no matter, no matter.\n\n3:00:07.500 --> 3:00:09.940\n But some people will go there.\n\n3:00:09.940 --> 3:00:14.340\n Now, people are here.\n\n3:00:14.340 --> 3:00:16.580\n What are we gonna do, dispose of them?\n\n3:00:16.580 --> 3:00:18.060\n That's not an option.\n\n3:00:18.060 --> 3:00:20.420\n So the only option we have left\n\n3:00:20.420 --> 3:00:22.060\n is to make sure that people partake.\n\n3:00:22.060 --> 3:00:23.980\n And what partaking means is that\n\n3:00:23.980 --> 3:00:26.740\n people get included in them\n\n3:00:26.740 --> 3:00:31.740\n and are part of the systems that allow for human flourishing.\n\n3:00:31.860 --> 3:00:33.820\n And it doesn't, it's not much.\n\n3:00:33.820 --> 3:00:35.940\n In this case, it's about,\n\n3:00:35.940 --> 3:00:38.820\n can we be serious about the reforms?\n\n3:00:38.820 --> 3:00:41.780\n So we have free market zones,\n\n3:00:41.780 --> 3:00:43.620\n areas where people,\n\n3:00:43.620 --> 3:00:47.220\n where the flourishing can start to take place.\n\n3:00:48.580 --> 3:00:52.660\n The wealth that people will need to flourish,\n\n3:00:52.660 --> 3:00:55.260\n they don't need you to give it to them.\n\n3:00:55.260 --> 3:00:58.580\n But it's all about, can I let you fly?\n\n3:00:58.580 --> 3:01:01.620\n And you will make it happen for you and also for me.\n\n3:01:02.500 --> 3:01:05.060\n Every young African I see today,\n\n3:01:05.060 --> 3:01:07.820\n I realize how stupid the rest of the world is\n\n3:01:07.820 --> 3:01:11.540\n if they're not supporting what I'm trying to talk about.\n\n3:01:11.540 --> 3:01:13.140\n Cause even if you don't wanna do it\n\n3:01:13.140 --> 3:01:14.020\n because that's the right thing to do,\n\n3:01:14.020 --> 3:01:16.140\n which I think it is the right thing to do,\n\n3:01:17.540 --> 3:01:20.580\n your selfishness, maybe engage your selfishness.\n\n3:01:20.580 --> 3:01:21.940\n Cause this person right there,\n\n3:01:21.940 --> 3:01:24.740\n remember I told you seven billion geniuses,\n\n3:01:24.740 --> 3:01:26.340\n everybody came to this world\n\n3:01:26.340 --> 3:01:30.500\n with a piece of solution to the human problem.\n\n3:01:30.500 --> 3:01:33.180\n This person and that person and that person\n\n3:01:34.260 --> 3:01:37.340\n hold something for me because I'm part of humanity.\n\n3:01:37.340 --> 3:01:41.060\n This person might have a cure to a cancer\n\n3:01:41.060 --> 3:01:44.340\n that might take my wife out, the wife I haven't met yet.\n\n3:01:44.340 --> 3:01:47.540\n But this kid right here has it inside.\n\n3:01:48.580 --> 3:01:50.300\n And if I help this,\n\n3:01:50.300 --> 3:01:52.940\n if I make sure that this kid gets a chance to flourish\n\n3:01:52.940 --> 3:01:56.460\n and to manifest his genius or her genius,\n\n3:01:56.460 --> 3:01:59.260\n that trickle down many years later,\n\n3:01:59.260 --> 3:02:03.060\n comes straight back to serve me and the love of my life.\n\n3:02:03.060 --> 3:02:04.700\n If we can't see it any other way,\n\n3:02:04.700 --> 3:02:07.020\n maybe let's try to think about it that way.\n\n3:02:07.020 --> 3:02:10.220\n Cause it becomes a very good proposition at that point.\n\n3:02:10.220 --> 3:02:13.100\n So in this case, by 2050,\n\n3:02:13.100 --> 3:02:16.820\n Lagos, Nigeria will be the largest city in the world.\n\n3:02:16.820 --> 3:02:19.820\n The future is African, whether we want it or not.\n\n3:02:19.820 --> 3:02:22.500\n But is it going to be an African future\n\n3:02:22.500 --> 3:02:25.700\n where you have a youth being a ticking bomb?\n\n3:02:27.020 --> 3:02:30.500\n Because they have not, there's no hope.\n\n3:02:30.500 --> 3:02:32.780\n They stay in poverty\n\n3:02:32.780 --> 3:02:34.980\n because they belong to nations that don't even understand\n\n3:02:34.980 --> 3:02:39.260\n sometimes the importance of common law versus civil law.\n\n3:02:39.260 --> 3:02:43.060\n Because they're trapped in countries that don't understand\n\n3:02:43.060 --> 3:02:46.860\n that you need to make the legal framework\n\n3:02:46.860 --> 3:02:49.260\n to provide for better economic freedom.\n\n3:02:49.260 --> 3:02:53.300\n So you can unleash the genuineness, the awesomeness,\n\n3:02:53.300 --> 3:02:57.340\n the ingenuity, the industrious side of your young people,\n\n3:02:57.340 --> 3:02:59.580\n especially of your women,\n\n3:02:59.580 --> 3:03:01.140\n so that they build all the wealth\n\n3:03:01.140 --> 3:03:03.380\n that your nation is gonna need you to build.\n\n3:03:03.380 --> 3:03:05.660\n And with it, the respect that comes from that.\n\n3:03:06.660 --> 3:03:08.220\n See, we have a choice to make.\n\n3:03:08.220 --> 3:03:12.020\n And this is why I feel so, so, so restless about this\n\n3:03:12.020 --> 3:03:14.260\n at this point of my life.\n\n3:03:14.260 --> 3:03:15.860\n We just lost George Hayite.\n\n3:03:17.140 --> 3:03:19.260\n George Hayite is one of the few Africans that I knew\n\n3:03:19.260 --> 3:03:22.820\n who put this out.\n\n3:03:22.820 --> 3:03:24.140\n That's who I learned from.\n\n3:03:24.140 --> 3:03:25.860\n He's gone.\n\n3:03:25.860 --> 3:03:29.580\n And I feel a strong sense of urgency\n\n3:03:29.580 --> 3:03:32.340\n to not only bring back to the table\n\n3:03:32.340 --> 3:03:34.340\n that which he has been working on,\n\n3:03:35.420 --> 3:03:37.860\n but to also make sure that it gets seen.\n\n3:03:37.860 --> 3:03:40.580\n That's why being here talking with you today,\n\n3:03:40.580 --> 3:03:44.300\n it's, you have no idea.\n\n3:03:44.300 --> 3:03:48.100\n It's, people ask, if someone like you could say,\n\n3:03:48.100 --> 3:03:49.300\n what can I do?\n\n3:03:49.300 --> 3:03:52.860\n You did more than you could ever imagine\n\n3:03:52.860 --> 3:03:56.260\n by just allowing me to take this message to one more person.\n\n3:03:57.380 --> 3:03:59.580\n And because if we do this,\n\n3:04:00.940 --> 3:04:03.220\n the change is gonna happen somewhere down the line.\n\n3:04:03.220 --> 3:04:04.060\n So.\n\n3:04:04.060 --> 3:04:04.980\n Yeah, the ripple effects of all of that\n\n3:04:04.980 --> 3:04:07.260\n on the unlocking the human potential.\n\n3:04:07.260 --> 3:04:08.100\n It's unbelievable.\n\n3:04:08.100 --> 3:04:12.300\n All those people in Africa are building cool stuff,\n\n3:04:12.300 --> 3:04:13.140\n amazing things.\n\n3:04:13.140 --> 3:04:14.340\n Yes, yes, yes.\n\n3:04:14.340 --> 3:04:15.900\n So some are gonna be built stuff,\n\n3:04:15.900 --> 3:04:17.620\n others are gonna work on the reforms.\n\n3:04:17.620 --> 3:04:19.140\n So we're working on reforms, by the way.\n\n3:04:19.140 --> 3:04:22.940\n I'm the head of the Africa Center for Prosperity\n\n3:04:22.940 --> 3:04:23.940\n of the Atlas Network,\n\n3:04:23.940 --> 3:04:26.060\n the largest organization in the world\n\n3:04:26.060 --> 3:04:27.980\n working on taking down barriers of entry\n\n3:04:27.980 --> 3:04:29.420\n for entrepreneurs around the world\n\n3:04:29.420 --> 3:04:31.020\n in their respective countries.\n\n3:04:31.020 --> 3:04:32.660\n So we're doing great work there.\n\n3:04:32.660 --> 3:04:36.940\n I basically, all the, obviously all the think tanks\n\n3:04:36.940 --> 3:04:41.140\n we have in Africa right now, free market think tanks,\n\n3:04:41.140 --> 3:04:43.860\n and we wanna promote more of them to come up.\n\n3:04:43.860 --> 3:04:46.620\n And these are local solutions by local people\n\n3:04:46.620 --> 3:04:48.780\n for their local problems, always.\n\n3:04:48.780 --> 3:04:50.220\n That's where we draw the line.\n\n3:04:50.220 --> 3:04:55.220\n And so there, so we're working on reforms primarily\n\n3:04:55.580 --> 3:04:57.180\n and making people understand the free markets\n\n3:04:57.180 --> 3:04:58.420\n and the importance of it.\n\n3:05:00.020 --> 3:05:03.180\n But it is piecemeal legislation.\n\n3:05:03.180 --> 3:05:04.700\n It takes time.\n\n3:05:04.700 --> 3:05:05.820\n It is hard.\n\n3:05:05.820 --> 3:05:07.940\n By the time you accomplish something here,\n\n3:05:07.940 --> 3:05:09.620\n more crap has happened over here.\n\n3:05:09.620 --> 3:05:10.900\n More laws have been pounded up\n\n3:05:10.900 --> 3:05:13.460\n because you know how they fix a bad law most of the time.\n\n3:05:13.460 --> 3:05:14.700\n Whether it's in the US or somewhere else.\n\n3:05:14.700 --> 3:05:17.620\n Put other laws to kind of undo the law from before,\n\n3:05:17.620 --> 3:05:18.900\n but it keeps stacking up.\n\n3:05:18.900 --> 3:05:20.340\n And before you know it,\n\n3:05:20.340 --> 3:05:22.500\n where you should have one thing and it's clear,\n\n3:05:22.500 --> 3:05:24.380\n you have a hundred and they go against each other\n\n3:05:24.380 --> 3:05:26.220\n and then it's all, it's worse.\n\n3:05:26.220 --> 3:05:28.940\n So we have piecemeal legislation that's happening.\n\n3:05:28.940 --> 3:05:31.260\n Our teams are doing really amazing, fantastic work,\n\n3:05:31.260 --> 3:05:33.980\n especially the team in Imani in Ghana.\n\n3:05:33.980 --> 3:05:37.100\n We have a group in Burundi, in the Great Lakes.\n\n3:05:37.100 --> 3:05:40.460\n I mean, people are doing amazing work, amazing work,\n\n3:05:40.460 --> 3:05:42.100\n but we need to run faster.\n\n3:05:42.100 --> 3:05:45.260\n So while we keep, we help them running faster,\n\n3:05:45.260 --> 3:05:48.060\n we also have to unlock other things.\n\n3:05:48.060 --> 3:05:49.060\n And right now I'm working\n\n3:05:49.060 --> 3:05:53.020\n on one of my most craziest projects.\n\n3:05:53.020 --> 3:05:57.140\n Something bold, radical, crazy for some people.\n\n3:05:57.140 --> 3:05:58.340\n But I know we're not crazy\n\n3:05:58.340 --> 3:06:00.860\n because before us, Singapore has done it.\n\n3:06:00.860 --> 3:06:03.380\n You know, Hong Kong has done it.\n\n3:06:03.380 --> 3:06:05.940\n Latest, the most recent China with the SSEs,\n\n3:06:05.940 --> 3:06:09.580\n the special economic zones,\n\n3:06:09.580 --> 3:06:12.700\n some of the most radical free market zones in the world,\n\n3:06:12.700 --> 3:06:13.740\n they've done it.\n\n3:06:13.740 --> 3:06:16.380\n And oftentimes within a generation,\n\n3:06:16.380 --> 3:06:19.020\n meaningful change start to happen, right?\n\n3:06:19.020 --> 3:06:23.700\n So here, what I'm working on is this concept of,\n\n3:06:23.700 --> 3:06:27.220\n some call it charter cities, Paul Romer,\n\n3:06:27.220 --> 3:06:32.220\n others call it the free cities.\n\n3:06:32.220 --> 3:06:35.060\n And I like to call it startup cities.\n\n3:06:35.060 --> 3:06:37.420\n What these are is for us to think about,\n\n3:06:37.420 --> 3:06:40.940\n okay, if piecemeal legislation takes forever,\n\n3:06:40.940 --> 3:06:43.820\n while we have this demographic\n\n3:06:43.820 --> 3:06:46.780\n that's growing faster and faster in Africa,\n\n3:06:46.780 --> 3:06:47.980\n there is a discrepancy here\n\n3:06:47.980 --> 3:06:51.020\n between the progress we're making\n\n3:06:51.020 --> 3:06:55.100\n to set the right environment for business to prop up,\n\n3:06:55.100 --> 3:06:58.660\n and how many more people are coming to life,\n\n3:06:58.660 --> 3:07:01.180\n literally every day on the continent.\n\n3:07:01.180 --> 3:07:02.460\n There's a discrepancy here.\n\n3:07:02.460 --> 3:07:05.260\n And so, the ticking bomb is going faster\n\n3:07:05.260 --> 3:07:08.060\n than the progress we can make.\n\n3:07:08.060 --> 3:07:09.420\n This is a problem.\n\n3:07:09.420 --> 3:07:11.140\n So what some of us are working on\n\n3:07:11.140 --> 3:07:12.620\n is this concept of a startup cities\n\n3:07:12.620 --> 3:07:17.220\n and to say, piecemeal legislation takes too long.\n\n3:07:17.220 --> 3:07:18.860\n How about we continue doing that work,\n\n3:07:18.860 --> 3:07:20.740\n which is essential and critical,\n\n3:07:20.740 --> 3:07:23.540\n but at the same time, can we think of zones,\n\n3:07:23.540 --> 3:07:26.660\n and I like to call them also common law zones,\n\n3:07:26.660 --> 3:07:31.660\n where we basically try to have within the country\n\n3:07:31.740 --> 3:07:34.180\n an area where for business,\n\n3:07:34.180 --> 3:07:36.180\n I'm not talking about family law or any of that stuff,\n\n3:07:36.180 --> 3:07:38.220\n no one is touching your culture or anything like that,\n\n3:07:38.220 --> 3:07:40.980\n but we're just saying business wise,\n\n3:07:40.980 --> 3:07:44.100\n an enclave where you have the best practices\n\n3:07:44.100 --> 3:07:46.340\n from around the world, including yours,\n\n3:07:46.340 --> 3:07:50.500\n in terms of what constitute a great business environment\n\n3:07:50.500 --> 3:07:53.780\n and allow people in,\n\n3:07:53.780 --> 3:07:58.780\n like you get in freely or nobody's forcing you to go,\n\n3:07:58.980 --> 3:08:00.740\n nobody's forcing you to whatever.\n\n3:08:00.740 --> 3:08:04.060\n So basically, you're to think about\n\n3:08:04.060 --> 3:08:09.060\n this rather unoccupied plot of land within a country,\n\n3:08:09.220 --> 3:08:12.780\n think Dubai, on 110 acres of land,\n\n3:08:12.780 --> 3:08:16.100\n Dubai is thinking that in their case,\n\n3:08:16.100 --> 3:08:17.980\n they're like, maybe they decided,\n\n3:08:17.980 --> 3:08:20.740\n maybe Sharia law is not the best for business in their case.\n\n3:08:20.740 --> 3:08:22.380\n And they said, they looked around and were like,\n\n3:08:22.380 --> 3:08:24.940\n wow, but common law, especially British common law,\n\n3:08:24.940 --> 3:08:26.700\n seems like a very good one.\n\n3:08:26.700 --> 3:08:29.820\n So at that point, they decided for business only,\n\n3:08:29.820 --> 3:08:31.260\n not family or anything like that,\n\n3:08:31.260 --> 3:08:33.500\n which is gonna stand to Sharia or whatever.\n\n3:08:33.500 --> 3:08:36.460\n And so they said, we are gonna bring in,\n\n3:08:38.500 --> 3:08:40.780\n so they hired retired British common law judges\n\n3:08:40.780 --> 3:08:44.140\n to educate the law and train the people under there.\n\n3:08:44.140 --> 3:08:46.740\n And I'm oversimplifying, but at the end of the day,\n\n3:08:47.820 --> 3:08:49.740\n within a generation,\n\n3:08:49.740 --> 3:08:53.060\n Dubai became one of the top\n\n3:08:53.060 --> 3:08:55.380\n international financial centers of the world.\n\n3:08:55.380 --> 3:08:56.780\n It is what it is today.\n\n3:08:58.900 --> 3:09:00.820\n And in the case of the African nations,\n\n3:09:00.820 --> 3:09:02.620\n that zone can then spread.\n\n3:09:02.620 --> 3:09:06.380\n Yes, it can not only spread, but maybe let's say Senegal,\n\n3:09:06.380 --> 3:09:09.180\n if Senegal was to go for this, here you have this one,\n\n3:09:09.180 --> 3:09:11.100\n and then over there you have another zone.\n\n3:09:11.100 --> 3:09:12.580\n And then what they start to do\n\n3:09:12.580 --> 3:09:14.540\n is they're not all modeled the same way,\n\n3:09:14.540 --> 3:09:15.980\n because maybe this one is saying,\n\n3:09:15.980 --> 3:09:18.180\n hey, we wanna attract more, I don't know,\n\n3:09:18.180 --> 3:09:22.340\n maybe we wanna attract more medical research, right?\n\n3:09:22.340 --> 3:09:23.380\n This one is gonna be saying,\n\n3:09:23.380 --> 3:09:26.100\n maybe we wanna attract more crypto,\n\n3:09:26.100 --> 3:09:27.660\n or maybe it's gonna be more like us,\n\n3:09:27.660 --> 3:09:29.980\n we wanna be more about religious this or whatever.\n\n3:09:29.980 --> 3:09:30.820\n You know what I mean?\n\n3:09:30.820 --> 3:09:32.740\n So we wanted to fit more of this or that.\n\n3:09:32.740 --> 3:09:36.740\n And just kind of give the basics, the grounds,\n\n3:09:36.740 --> 3:09:40.500\n and then watch the magic happen on it, right?\n\n3:09:40.500 --> 3:09:43.500\n And so this is what we're working on.\n\n3:09:43.500 --> 3:09:46.540\n And the hope there, because some people are like,\n\n3:09:46.540 --> 3:09:49.020\n I know some people are like, you guys are crazy,\n\n3:09:49.020 --> 3:09:52.340\n but hey, I'm like, no, it's more or less the story\n\n3:09:52.340 --> 3:09:55.780\n of the Asian tigers.\n\n3:09:55.780 --> 3:09:59.620\n And most recently, most of China's progress,\n\n3:09:59.620 --> 3:10:01.380\n economically speaking, because some people might say,\n\n3:10:01.380 --> 3:10:05.380\n well, you don't want China, we're developing, you see.\n\n3:10:05.380 --> 3:10:10.380\n Even then I say, and it's okay, you can always do better,\n\n3:10:10.660 --> 3:10:14.780\n but we cannot deny what the magic\n\n3:10:14.780 --> 3:10:16.740\n that they have accomplished, what they have accomplished\n\n3:10:16.740 --> 3:10:18.420\n is nothing short of a miracle.\n\n3:10:18.420 --> 3:10:20.660\n 800 million people getting out of poverty\n\n3:10:20.660 --> 3:10:21.500\n in such a short amount of time.\n\n3:10:21.500 --> 3:10:22.340\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n3:10:22.340 --> 3:10:25.540\n So it's not, yeah, for the quality of life\n\n3:10:25.540 --> 3:10:27.580\n and the majority of the Chinese population.\n\n3:10:27.580 --> 3:10:28.420\n Yes, yes.\n\n3:10:28.420 --> 3:10:30.180\n Does something like that happen without problems?\n\n3:10:30.180 --> 3:10:31.660\n Of course not.\n\n3:10:31.660 --> 3:10:33.780\n And so the next person to do something\n\n3:10:33.780 --> 3:10:36.020\n just actually gets to learn from lessons,\n\n3:10:36.020 --> 3:10:37.340\n from lessons, that's all.\n\n3:10:37.340 --> 3:10:38.180\n And leapfrog.\n\n3:10:38.180 --> 3:10:40.340\n And leapfrog, and leapfrog, exactly.\n\n3:10:40.340 --> 3:10:41.860\n So for me, this is a promise.\n\n3:10:41.860 --> 3:10:44.180\n And the people are like, oh, but you guys are crazy.\n\n3:10:44.180 --> 3:10:46.100\n But I'm like, just like with everything,\n\n3:10:46.100 --> 3:10:47.380\n do you know how many attempts it took\n\n3:10:47.380 --> 3:10:50.860\n before the first flight, the Wright brothers took off?\n\n3:10:50.860 --> 3:10:52.620\n Do you know how many?\n\n3:10:52.620 --> 3:10:54.220\n And that's important.\n\n3:10:54.220 --> 3:10:56.660\n You try, you crash, you try, you crash,\n\n3:10:56.660 --> 3:10:59.340\n but each time you're going up higher\n\n3:10:59.340 --> 3:11:04.020\n and you want to get up for once, then you stay up longer.\n\n3:11:04.020 --> 3:11:06.660\n And before you know it, you're doing all types of things.\n\n3:11:06.660 --> 3:11:07.580\n So here's the same thing.\n\n3:11:07.580 --> 3:11:14.740\n And I tell people, listen, all I need is one success story.\n\n3:11:14.740 --> 3:11:17.620\n And then the sea change.\n\n3:11:17.620 --> 3:11:19.460\n People don't even wait for us.\n\n3:11:19.460 --> 3:11:20.500\n Everybody.\n\n3:11:20.500 --> 3:11:24.380\n But this is hard because it's the first time.\n\n3:11:24.380 --> 3:11:26.740\n But the good news is there are many groups\n\n3:11:26.740 --> 3:11:28.460\n working on the continent.\n\n3:11:28.460 --> 3:11:31.300\n There are some groups in Zambia.\n\n3:11:31.300 --> 3:11:32.460\n There's a zone there.\n\n3:11:32.460 --> 3:11:35.020\n Folks are doing something like this in Nigeria.\n\n3:11:35.020 --> 3:11:37.820\n We're part of a project there in Nigeria.\n\n3:11:37.820 --> 3:11:39.460\n The one that I'm most excited about,\n\n3:11:39.460 --> 3:11:41.420\n I cannot disclose the name of the country yet.\n\n3:11:41.420 --> 3:11:44.020\n But my god, I'm so excited by it.\n\n3:11:44.020 --> 3:11:46.220\n And I just know, I just know, Lex,\n\n3:11:46.220 --> 3:11:47.780\n it's going to happen in our lifetime.\n\n3:11:47.780 --> 3:11:48.500\n I hope so.\n\n3:11:48.500 --> 3:11:49.980\n It's a really powerful vision.\n\n3:11:49.980 --> 3:11:52.860\n And it's not being dramatic to say\n\n3:11:52.860 --> 3:11:57.300\n that the future of humanity depends on your success,\n\n3:11:57.300 --> 3:11:59.300\n that success in Africa.\n\n3:11:59.300 --> 3:12:02.020\n It's such an important continent.\n\n3:12:02.020 --> 3:12:02.500\n It is.\n\n3:12:02.500 --> 3:12:03.220\n In this century.\n\n3:12:03.220 --> 3:12:05.580\n It's the continent where everything started.\n\n3:12:05.580 --> 3:12:09.500\n And I think it's the continent where that continent has\n\n3:12:09.500 --> 3:12:11.300\n to finally, finally, finally thrive.\n\n3:12:11.300 --> 3:12:16.300\n We cannot, all of us, call ourselves an enlightened\n\n3:12:16.300 --> 3:12:18.420\n society as a whole.\n\n3:12:18.420 --> 3:12:21.020\n When you have such, when you have this,\n\n3:12:21.020 --> 3:12:22.300\n it's a humongous continent.\n\n3:12:22.300 --> 3:12:24.700\n Have you seen the size of it?\n\n3:12:24.700 --> 3:12:25.460\n You know?\n\n3:12:25.460 --> 3:12:26.300\n Yeah.\n\n3:12:26.300 --> 3:12:28.620\n It's hard to fathom, actually.\n\n3:12:28.620 --> 3:12:29.620\n Yeah.\n\n3:12:29.620 --> 3:12:30.460\n Exactly.\n\n3:12:30.460 --> 3:12:33.020\n And it has such ingenious people.\n\n3:12:33.020 --> 3:12:35.700\n Sometimes I look at my people.\n\n3:12:35.700 --> 3:12:41.060\n I have to tell you, I'm so proud of them,\n\n3:12:41.060 --> 3:12:42.740\n and the young people, especially.\n\n3:12:42.740 --> 3:12:44.940\n And you know, you would look at them.\n\n3:12:44.940 --> 3:12:47.100\n And you know, somebody said sometimes one day,\n\n3:12:47.100 --> 3:12:49.580\n and it was so true, they said, you know,\n\n3:12:49.580 --> 3:12:52.260\n we've seen poverty other places.\n\n3:12:52.260 --> 3:12:56.980\n But here, it is just, maybe somebody doesn't have money,\n\n3:12:56.980 --> 3:12:58.660\n but they have dignity.\n\n3:12:58.660 --> 3:13:00.100\n And it's true.\n\n3:13:00.100 --> 3:13:00.740\n Yeah.\n\n3:13:00.740 --> 3:13:02.180\n So everything else we can handle,\n\n3:13:02.180 --> 3:13:03.420\n and we will handle.\n\n3:13:03.420 --> 3:13:05.140\n You have to mark my word for this.\n\n3:13:05.140 --> 3:13:06.660\n This is going to happen.\n\n3:13:06.660 --> 3:13:09.700\n And our youth is amazing.\n\n3:13:09.700 --> 3:13:11.260\n You should see them.\n\n3:13:11.260 --> 3:13:12.620\n So full of creativity.\n\n3:13:12.620 --> 3:13:13.580\n And it doesn't matter.\n\n3:13:13.580 --> 3:13:15.180\n You know, you were telling me, what makes you different?\n\n3:13:15.180 --> 3:13:16.740\n Many things makes us all different.\n\n3:13:16.740 --> 3:13:19.940\n You know, the Rwandans are very different from the West\n\n3:13:19.940 --> 3:13:21.740\n Africans that we are.\n\n3:13:21.740 --> 3:13:24.540\n Rwandans, for example, never dance with their hips.\n\n3:13:24.540 --> 3:13:28.620\n They dance more like, you know, with this part of the body.\n\n3:13:28.620 --> 3:13:30.060\n West Africans hips?\n\n3:13:30.060 --> 3:13:32.260\n Us, it's hips all over the place, all the time.\n\n3:13:32.260 --> 3:13:34.620\n And it's, you know, more jumping, stuff like that.\n\n3:13:34.620 --> 3:13:36.380\n In Rwanda, you feel it's more like, you know,\n\n3:13:36.380 --> 3:13:40.380\n I mean, they remind me more of, you know, the ballet thing.\n\n3:13:40.380 --> 3:13:42.460\n Rwandans have a sense where, you know,\n\n3:13:42.460 --> 3:13:45.260\n they don't eat, you know, so much in public.\n\n3:13:45.260 --> 3:13:46.140\n It's not very well.\n\n3:13:46.140 --> 3:13:47.900\n It's something you do.\n\n3:13:47.900 --> 3:13:50.140\n Us, we are, the West Africans, we like to be loud.\n\n3:13:50.140 --> 3:13:53.660\n We're almost like the Italians of the continent.\n\n3:13:53.660 --> 3:13:56.220\n And then the Rwandans are more like, you know, the Swiss stuff.\n\n3:13:56.220 --> 3:13:58.420\n Actually, the country even looks like Switzerland.\n\n3:13:58.420 --> 3:14:00.780\n I mean, we're so different from one group to another.\n\n3:14:00.780 --> 3:14:02.860\n Then you go to the Congo and you see these guys,\n\n3:14:02.860 --> 3:14:03.700\n they're so crazy.\n\n3:14:03.700 --> 3:14:05.500\n We have a dress, I mean, les sapeurs.\n\n3:14:05.500 --> 3:14:08.460\n So we are a very different bunch.\n\n3:14:08.460 --> 3:14:10.940\n But you know what I love about us,\n\n3:14:10.940 --> 3:14:12.340\n what I love about my people?\n\n3:14:18.660 --> 3:14:21.740\n We are the manifestation of what resiliency means.\n\n3:14:21.740 --> 3:14:26.740\n And so everything we need is there.\n\n3:14:26.740 --> 3:14:29.220\n Everything we need is there.\n\n3:14:29.220 --> 3:14:32.420\n I will say that there's nothing wrong with the seed.\n\n3:14:32.420 --> 3:14:35.940\n Everything that's wrong with us\n\n3:14:35.940 --> 3:14:39.260\n is that pot that we put around us.\n\n3:14:39.260 --> 3:14:43.140\n So we're tired of being bonsai people.\n\n3:14:43.140 --> 3:14:45.780\n We need to be the tallest trees in the forest\n\n3:14:45.780 --> 3:14:47.180\n that we were designed to be.\n\n3:14:47.180 --> 3:14:48.020\n And so...\n\n3:14:48.020 --> 3:14:49.460\n And that can be fixed.\n\n3:14:49.460 --> 3:14:50.260\n And that can be fixed.\n\n3:14:50.260 --> 3:14:51.100\n And that's the beauty of it.\n\n3:14:51.100 --> 3:14:54.740\n And that's why I am so, I'm almost dizzy with,\n\n3:14:54.740 --> 3:14:57.500\n I get dizzy with hope.\n\n3:14:57.500 --> 3:14:59.100\n I know my history.\n\n3:14:59.100 --> 3:15:03.620\n I know my economics, my fellow humans and all of that.\n\n3:15:03.620 --> 3:15:06.340\n And we know that there's an unfailing recipe.\n\n3:15:08.740 --> 3:15:10.020\n And when it comes to that recipe,\n\n3:15:10.020 --> 3:15:11.700\n we have the hardest part of it.\n\n3:15:13.180 --> 3:15:16.300\n The one missing ingredient, which is the free markets.\n\n3:15:18.220 --> 3:15:23.100\n As we go around and talk and people start to understand\n\n3:15:23.100 --> 3:15:25.460\n and each country tries to figure out,\n\n3:15:25.460 --> 3:15:28.140\n okay, where do we go there from here?\n\n3:15:29.660 --> 3:15:34.660\n I know that I will die with my continent\n\n3:15:35.140 --> 3:15:38.860\n having taken the right shift for a turn.\n\n3:15:38.860 --> 3:15:40.180\n I don't have to see where it ends\n\n3:15:40.180 --> 3:15:42.260\n because I cannot in my wildest dream\n\n3:15:42.260 --> 3:15:44.060\n imagine where it's gonna end.\n\n3:15:44.060 --> 3:15:47.620\n But I know it's gonna be, yeah.\n\n3:15:47.620 --> 3:15:52.620\n So my only job is to get this message out\n\n3:15:53.380 --> 3:15:56.340\n and then let my people do with it what they wanna do.\n\n3:15:56.340 --> 3:15:57.180\n That's all.\n\n3:15:57.180 --> 3:15:59.340\n Yeah, the scale of impact is just boundless.\n\n3:15:59.340 --> 3:16:00.180\n It's kind of cool.\n\n3:16:00.180 --> 3:16:02.620\n I mean, sometimes we think about individual problems\n\n3:16:02.620 --> 3:16:03.580\n and how do we solve them?\n\n3:16:03.580 --> 3:16:05.780\n We look up at certain individuals,\n\n3:16:05.780 --> 3:16:08.860\n like the, I don't know, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.\n\n3:16:08.860 --> 3:16:12.700\n But it's so much more powerful to just,\n\n3:16:12.700 --> 3:16:15.180\n without knowing what they will do,\n\n3:16:15.180 --> 3:16:19.940\n give the freedom to millions,\n\n3:16:19.940 --> 3:16:22.180\n to hundreds of millions of people\n\n3:16:22.180 --> 3:16:23.820\n to do whatever the hell they're gonna do.\n\n3:16:23.820 --> 3:16:25.180\n Can you imagine?\n\n3:16:25.180 --> 3:16:26.500\n Can you just imagine?\n\n3:16:26.500 --> 3:16:27.740\n It's truly, truly exciting.\n\n3:16:27.740 --> 3:16:30.180\n So in that sense, the work you're doing,\n\n3:16:30.180 --> 3:16:33.580\n it's unimaginable the kind of impact it would have.\n\n3:16:33.580 --> 3:16:36.180\n Now, going back to that hard moment,\n\n3:16:36.180 --> 3:16:38.900\n this dark place you went in your mind\n\n3:16:38.900 --> 3:16:41.860\n and your personal life story, you lost your husband.\n\n3:16:41.860 --> 3:16:44.980\n What gave you strength during that time?\n\n3:16:44.980 --> 3:16:49.060\n What were the places you went to your mind\n\n3:16:49.060 --> 3:16:52.780\n in terms of personal struggle,\n\n3:16:52.780 --> 3:16:54.700\n in terms of maybe even depression\n\n3:16:54.700 --> 3:16:57.940\n or these kinds of struggles?\n\n3:16:57.940 --> 3:17:01.260\n I think for me, when my person passed away,\n\n3:17:03.020 --> 3:17:06.220\n I went to,\n\n3:17:08.180 --> 3:17:10.020\n maybe my friends could see what was going on,\n\n3:17:10.020 --> 3:17:11.820\n maybe they couldn't, I don't know.\n\n3:17:11.820 --> 3:17:14.420\n But on the surface, I looked like I was fine.\n\n3:17:14.420 --> 3:17:16.260\n But what happened is the only thing I think\n\n3:17:16.260 --> 3:17:18.620\n that kept me around as I thought about it\n\n3:17:19.900 --> 3:17:24.220\n was the job to be done.\n\n3:17:26.860 --> 3:17:31.260\n These women relied on me and I was no longer free.\n\n3:17:31.260 --> 3:17:32.380\n I did not own myself.\n\n3:17:32.380 --> 3:17:33.420\n And they said it in those words,\n\n3:17:33.420 --> 3:17:34.980\n you don't own yourself anymore.\n\n3:17:36.220 --> 3:17:39.060\n And it was true, but it helped me\n\n3:17:39.060 --> 3:17:43.780\n because I was able to, you know,\n\n3:17:43.780 --> 3:17:45.860\n sometimes whatever it takes to keep you around,\n\n3:17:45.860 --> 3:17:47.100\n whatever it takes.\n\n3:17:47.100 --> 3:17:49.180\n And that's what I would tell people who feel like\n\n3:17:49.180 --> 3:17:51.820\n they can't just push one more push\n\n3:17:51.820 --> 3:17:54.140\n and they think they need to end it.\n\n3:17:54.140 --> 3:17:55.780\n At that point, whatever it takes,\n\n3:17:55.780 --> 3:17:57.980\n just stick around for one more second\n\n3:17:57.980 --> 3:18:00.500\n because the next second, you know.\n\n3:18:00.500 --> 3:18:04.180\n So I stuck around because of duty.\n\n3:18:04.180 --> 3:18:06.300\n I felt a very strong sense of duty.\n\n3:18:06.300 --> 3:18:08.300\n My duty was in this case, I think,\n\n3:18:08.300 --> 3:18:10.420\n stronger than my pain.\n\n3:18:10.420 --> 3:18:13.660\n I don't know how that was possible, but it was.\n\n3:18:17.260 --> 3:18:20.940\n And I just pushed my grief under the rug for years.\n\n3:18:20.940 --> 3:18:22.740\n For years, I worked like a mad lady.\n\n3:18:23.940 --> 3:18:28.020\n I would travel, I would do three states in three days,\n\n3:18:28.020 --> 3:18:29.780\n landing at two in the morning,\n\n3:18:29.780 --> 3:18:33.020\n around five or six going right along with our distributors\n\n3:18:33.020 --> 3:18:35.460\n because it was beverage and just keep going\n\n3:18:35.460 --> 3:18:38.380\n and have all of this energy and look like everything is fine.\n\n3:18:38.380 --> 3:18:39.700\n But what happened was just like,\n\n3:18:39.700 --> 3:18:41.380\n I was focused on the job to be done.\n\n3:18:41.380 --> 3:18:43.700\n And sometimes it is okay to do that.\n\n3:18:43.700 --> 3:18:46.780\n At least for me, it was my safety.\n\n3:18:46.780 --> 3:18:47.860\n You know, like when you're in the water\n\n3:18:47.860 --> 3:18:50.580\n and you're about to sink and they throw you that,\n\n3:18:50.580 --> 3:18:53.420\n that round thing, I don't know how you call it.\n\n3:18:53.420 --> 3:18:55.140\n You know, that, you know.\n\n3:18:55.140 --> 3:18:56.140\n I think that keeps you afloat, you mean?\n\n3:18:56.140 --> 3:18:57.220\n Yes, yes, the floater.\n\n3:18:57.220 --> 3:18:58.460\n It's the floater. Yeah, whatever.\n\n3:18:58.460 --> 3:19:01.980\n Listen, between the two of us, we're still terrible.\n\n3:19:01.980 --> 3:19:02.820\n We're bad.\n\n3:19:02.820 --> 3:19:04.940\n So I said, you, you, you.\n\n3:19:04.940 --> 3:19:06.260\n I know exactly what you mean.\n\n3:19:06.260 --> 3:19:07.100\n Exactly, right?\n\n3:19:07.100 --> 3:19:08.140\n So you understand me.\n\n3:19:08.140 --> 3:19:10.540\n So they send you that thing and you just,\n\n3:19:10.540 --> 3:19:12.540\n I was just hanging onto it.\n\n3:19:12.540 --> 3:19:14.380\n My life depended on this thing.\n\n3:19:14.380 --> 3:19:17.460\n So these women, they carried me.\n\n3:19:17.460 --> 3:19:19.220\n They carried me.\n\n3:19:19.220 --> 3:19:23.500\n And with time, things are moving forward.\n\n3:19:23.500 --> 3:19:26.820\n And at some point I went into really, really deep depression\n\n3:19:26.820 --> 3:19:29.580\n and I went into a very dark place,\n\n3:19:29.580 --> 3:19:31.780\n even darker than the one I think I came from.\n\n3:19:31.780 --> 3:19:35.100\n Because by that time I had worked for years\n\n3:19:35.100 --> 3:19:37.860\n on this company and now some other things was happening.\n\n3:19:37.860 --> 3:19:42.060\n And around that time, it's also when I was discovering\n\n3:19:42.060 --> 3:19:45.060\n a lot of what we talked about today,\n\n3:19:45.060 --> 3:19:47.900\n about what makes a country rich.\n\n3:19:47.900 --> 3:19:52.740\n And for me to understand that my network,\n\n3:19:52.740 --> 3:19:56.180\n I was very much into left oriented network.\n\n3:19:56.180 --> 3:20:01.180\n And to just start to see all of this,\n\n3:20:02.580 --> 3:20:05.660\n I tried to address it to realize that many of these people\n\n3:20:05.660 --> 3:20:08.060\n would prefer go running for the hills\n\n3:20:08.060 --> 3:20:11.860\n than accept for a moment that maybe capitalism\n\n3:20:11.860 --> 3:20:13.660\n might be part of a solution,\n\n3:20:13.660 --> 3:20:16.300\n when many of them were involved in capitalism.\n\n3:20:17.300 --> 3:20:20.300\n So that was a hard time.\n\n3:20:21.500 --> 3:20:23.940\n At some point I was, yeah,\n\n3:20:23.940 --> 3:20:27.260\n so many things were happening around that time\n\n3:20:27.260 --> 3:20:32.260\n that basically shook up everything for me.\n\n3:20:32.980 --> 3:20:34.980\n One, it's hard to talk about because it's very personal\n\n3:20:34.980 --> 3:20:38.860\n and the person that I was having a problem with\n\n3:20:38.860 --> 3:20:41.060\n passed away last year.\n\n3:20:41.060 --> 3:20:45.220\n And I'm one to always say, leave the dead alone.\n\n3:20:45.220 --> 3:20:48.060\n So because of that, I won't speak about it,\n\n3:20:48.060 --> 3:20:50.460\n but there to having a major fallout\n\n3:20:50.460 --> 3:20:52.900\n with somebody who was like a father figure for me,\n\n3:20:52.900 --> 3:20:55.180\n somebody that I completely trusted.\n\n3:20:55.180 --> 3:20:58.660\n And so at some point you just tell, ask yourself,\n\n3:20:58.660 --> 3:21:03.660\n was my whole life built on a lie, right?\n\n3:21:04.340 --> 3:21:09.100\n And then you're confused and then you become confused.\n\n3:21:09.100 --> 3:21:12.580\n And then at some point you lose 90% of your friends\n\n3:21:12.580 --> 3:21:15.580\n because of, ideologically speaking, it doesn't work anymore.\n\n3:21:18.580 --> 3:21:22.100\n Then you just wonder, have I,\n\n3:21:22.100 --> 3:21:25.340\n have I been asleep this whole time?\n\n3:21:25.340 --> 3:21:26.260\n And then you start to wonder,\n\n3:21:26.260 --> 3:21:28.020\n remember when you asked me, who am I?\n\n3:21:28.020 --> 3:21:31.300\n At some point, Lex, I literally was like a candle\n\n3:21:31.300 --> 3:21:32.140\n in the wind.\n\n3:21:33.620 --> 3:21:35.620\n I felt like I was a candle in the wind.\n\n3:21:36.660 --> 3:21:38.860\n And it was very hard to come back from that.\n\n3:21:38.860 --> 3:21:41.980\n And people have a hard,\n\n3:21:41.980 --> 3:21:43.820\n the few people I talk to about this,\n\n3:21:43.820 --> 3:21:45.460\n they have a hardest time understanding\n\n3:21:45.460 --> 3:21:48.100\n or even believing it because they're like, you?\n\n3:21:48.100 --> 3:21:49.940\n I'm like, yes, me.\n\n3:21:49.940 --> 3:21:52.260\n I used to be a candle in the wind.\n\n3:21:52.260 --> 3:21:53.620\n What got you out?\n\n3:21:53.620 --> 3:21:55.420\n What made you overcome that?\n\n3:21:55.420 --> 3:21:57.420\n My current husband.\n\n3:21:57.420 --> 3:21:58.380\n My current husband.\n\n3:21:58.380 --> 3:21:59.220\n Love?\n\n3:21:59.220 --> 3:22:00.060\n Love.\n\n3:22:00.060 --> 3:22:01.940\n See, when I tell you love is the answer.\n\n3:22:01.940 --> 3:22:04.300\n But him, he came with love,\n\n3:22:04.300 --> 3:22:08.780\n but he also came with really helping me\n\n3:22:08.780 --> 3:22:10.180\n figure out the world.\n\n3:22:10.180 --> 3:22:11.860\n So what Michael, because that's him,\n\n3:22:11.860 --> 3:22:13.820\n who we're talking about, Michael Strong.\n\n3:22:15.140 --> 3:22:16.420\n That must be special.\n\n3:22:16.420 --> 3:22:17.660\n He's so special.\n\n3:22:17.660 --> 3:22:18.900\n He's so special.\n\n3:22:18.900 --> 3:22:21.420\n So you have no idea how special he is.\n\n3:22:21.420 --> 3:22:24.940\n But you know, Michael, the reason why I have such love,\n\n3:22:24.940 --> 3:22:26.860\n respect and admiration for my husband,\n\n3:22:26.860 --> 3:22:28.540\n I'll never say it enough,\n\n3:22:28.540 --> 3:22:32.340\n is because actually it's one of those relationships\n\n3:22:32.340 --> 3:22:37.340\n that got built based on intellect first.\n\n3:22:37.420 --> 3:22:41.300\n You see, at some point I was in the position\n\n3:22:41.300 --> 3:22:43.540\n where I could start a foundation\n\n3:22:44.500 --> 3:22:46.860\n after having built my first business.\n\n3:22:46.860 --> 3:22:51.860\n And all I wanted was an ability to power\n\n3:22:54.300 --> 3:22:56.980\n as many, especially women,\n\n3:22:56.980 --> 3:23:00.620\n African women entrepreneurs like me a few years ago,\n\n3:23:00.620 --> 3:23:04.540\n before then, to do something like I was able to do.\n\n3:23:04.540 --> 3:23:06.020\n Bring back to the world\n\n3:23:06.020 --> 3:23:08.260\n some really cool aspects of our culture\n\n3:23:08.260 --> 3:23:11.740\n built into a really cool brand, 21st century type.\n\n3:23:11.740 --> 3:23:12.820\n That's what I wanted to do.\n\n3:23:12.820 --> 3:23:15.620\n Because the more I could promote women like that\n\n3:23:15.620 --> 3:23:17.460\n and put steam behind them,\n\n3:23:17.460 --> 3:23:19.700\n and the more my dream envisioned\n\n3:23:19.700 --> 3:23:22.540\n for a respected Africa, prosperous Africa would happen,\n\n3:23:22.540 --> 3:23:24.660\n back then that's what I wanted.\n\n3:23:24.660 --> 3:23:26.220\n And around me,\n\n3:23:26.220 --> 3:23:28.980\n this was also part of a whole crisis\n\n3:23:28.980 --> 3:23:32.020\n of ideologies I had back then.\n\n3:23:32.020 --> 3:23:36.380\n Everybody was like, well, we should be just doing grants.\n\n3:23:37.580 --> 3:23:40.660\n And I knew that my people didn't need grants.\n\n3:23:40.660 --> 3:23:42.260\n They didn't need like a handout.\n\n3:23:42.260 --> 3:23:45.260\n They don't want your charity.\n\n3:23:45.260 --> 3:23:46.900\n I didn't want charity.\n\n3:23:46.900 --> 3:23:50.260\n I wanted someone who could work with me on my accounting.\n\n3:23:50.260 --> 3:23:53.780\n I wanted somebody who could help me brainstorm\n\n3:23:53.780 --> 3:23:55.060\n marketing wise.\n\n3:23:55.060 --> 3:23:58.620\n I wanted somebody, or I needed to raise money\n\n3:23:58.620 --> 3:24:02.580\n to pay my research and development guy\n\n3:24:02.580 --> 3:24:07.100\n to help me take the juices from my grandma's recipe\n\n3:24:07.100 --> 3:24:10.420\n to something that can be shelf stable.\n\n3:24:10.420 --> 3:24:14.460\n I needed coaching.\n\n3:24:14.460 --> 3:24:16.740\n These are all the things that I needed\n\n3:24:16.740 --> 3:24:18.100\n to make my dream happen.\n\n3:24:18.100 --> 3:24:20.220\n I didn't want you to give me some crap for free.\n\n3:24:20.220 --> 3:24:21.180\n That's not what I want.\n\n3:24:21.180 --> 3:24:24.060\n I just want to be able to build my business\n\n3:24:24.060 --> 3:24:26.540\n with all the things that business building needs.\n\n3:24:26.540 --> 3:24:29.740\n And so that's what I wanted to do\n\n3:24:29.740 --> 3:24:31.340\n and it's what it was needed.\n\n3:24:31.340 --> 3:24:35.700\n And so Michael, somebody found out about what I was doing\n\n3:24:35.700 --> 3:24:37.100\n because back in the days of San Francisco,\n\n3:24:37.100 --> 3:24:38.740\n they would write a lot about me and everything.\n\n3:24:38.740 --> 3:24:43.100\n And so Michael, along with John Mackey,\n\n3:24:43.100 --> 3:24:44.380\n the founder of Whole Foods Market,\n\n3:24:44.380 --> 3:24:47.500\n they had a nonprofit called Flow.\n\n3:24:47.500 --> 3:24:49.380\n And it's all about human flourishing.\n\n3:24:49.380 --> 3:24:52.140\n They want for people, everybody to get this choice,\n\n3:24:52.140 --> 3:24:54.580\n this ability to be able to get to a point in their life\n\n3:24:54.580 --> 3:24:56.340\n where they're in complete flow.\n\n3:24:56.340 --> 3:24:58.540\n It's, Michael, just make high.\n\n3:24:58.540 --> 3:25:00.340\n Michael is the only one who could say that last name.\n\n3:25:00.340 --> 3:25:01.860\n But you know, the whole concept of flow,\n\n3:25:01.860 --> 3:25:02.980\n when you're in a state of flow,\n\n3:25:02.980 --> 3:25:05.900\n you're basically doing what you're supposed to do,\n\n3:25:05.900 --> 3:25:06.900\n the way you're supposed to do it\n\n3:25:06.900 --> 3:25:09.820\n with the people you're supposed to, this whole concept of flow.\n\n3:25:09.820 --> 3:25:12.340\n It's human flourishing at its highest.\n\n3:25:12.340 --> 3:25:15.380\n So, you know, so I meet with this man.\n\n3:25:15.380 --> 3:25:20.380\n Max, you're so, okay, so we, he finds me, his people find me.\n\n3:25:21.060 --> 3:25:22.700\n And then there was a program\n\n3:25:22.700 --> 3:25:25.860\n where it was all about accelerating women entrepreneurs.\n\n3:25:25.860 --> 3:25:27.620\n So it's during this times\n\n3:25:27.620 --> 3:25:29.940\n that I'm starting now to see things.\n\n3:25:29.940 --> 3:25:33.020\n That's when actually all of this stuff that I noticed,\n\n3:25:33.020 --> 3:25:35.300\n how come here it takes me all of this time\n\n3:25:35.300 --> 3:25:37.020\n to start my business, over there it's 20 minutes,\n\n3:25:37.020 --> 3:25:39.020\n here it's free, over there it's thousands of dollars,\n\n3:25:39.020 --> 3:25:40.580\n all of this nonsense that I just took,\n\n3:25:40.580 --> 3:25:41.900\n oh, maybe it's just because we're messed up,\n\n3:25:41.900 --> 3:25:44.860\n we're poor, that's why everything is so messed up.\n\n3:25:44.860 --> 3:25:47.460\n Whoa, these people are introducing me to concepts.\n\n3:25:47.460 --> 3:25:50.860\n I'm like, first of all, I'm like, oh, really?\n\n3:25:50.860 --> 3:25:55.860\n What did you call the doing business in the, what is that?\n\n3:25:56.380 --> 3:25:58.340\n You know, all of this stuff.\n\n3:25:58.340 --> 3:26:02.500\n And I'm starting to discover this whole other body of work.\n\n3:26:02.500 --> 3:26:06.900\n That the free markets, like this thing that I was sensing,\n\n3:26:06.900 --> 3:26:08.260\n this environment that I was sensing\n\n3:26:08.260 --> 3:26:10.980\n that it was different around me.\n\n3:26:10.980 --> 3:26:13.860\n And that they called it the free markets over here.\n\n3:26:13.860 --> 3:26:15.660\n And over there, that.\n\n3:26:15.660 --> 3:26:18.460\n And then I started to butt head those ideas\n\n3:26:18.460 --> 3:26:21.740\n with the ideas that I was fed with before that.\n\n3:26:21.740 --> 3:26:23.820\n And the evidence won.\n\n3:26:23.820 --> 3:26:25.660\n And further more than the evidence,\n\n3:26:25.660 --> 3:26:29.300\n the evidence combined with my lived experience,\n\n3:26:29.300 --> 3:26:30.700\n it was so powerful.\n\n3:26:30.700 --> 3:26:34.060\n So I basically started understanding these ideas\n\n3:26:34.060 --> 3:26:36.460\n from the most visceral part of my body,\n\n3:26:36.460 --> 3:26:37.860\n you know, of my being.\n\n3:26:38.860 --> 3:26:41.060\n And it makes sense.\n\n3:26:41.060 --> 3:26:45.420\n So Michael, Michael helped me find the solution,\n\n3:26:45.420 --> 3:26:49.900\n the answer to my lifelong little girl's question\n\n3:26:49.900 --> 3:26:52.260\n of why do they have this and we don't?\n\n3:26:52.260 --> 3:26:55.540\n And how do some countries like mine be poor\n\n3:26:55.540 --> 3:26:57.540\n while others are rich?\n\n3:26:57.540 --> 3:27:01.580\n And with understanding all of that,\n\n3:27:02.460 --> 3:27:07.460\n the greatest, biggest sense of liberation came upon me.\n\n3:27:09.220 --> 3:27:12.380\n Like, I have no other word to describe that.\n\n3:27:13.780 --> 3:27:16.820\n True liberation, the liberation that comes from a peer\n\n3:27:16.820 --> 3:27:21.820\n to finally understand and be vindicated\n\n3:27:21.900 --> 3:27:25.260\n in your own, you know,\n\n3:27:25.260 --> 3:27:29.100\n understand in your own deep knowing\n\n3:27:29.100 --> 3:27:32.460\n or feeling that they're not,\n\n3:27:32.460 --> 3:27:33.660\n what they're saying is not true.\n\n3:27:33.660 --> 3:27:35.100\n You're not the problem.\n\n3:27:35.100 --> 3:27:36.620\n It's not you.\n\n3:27:36.620 --> 3:27:38.620\n There's something else.\n\n3:27:38.620 --> 3:27:41.260\n And when I discovered that, my whole life changed.\n\n3:27:41.260 --> 3:27:44.740\n So, and since then I have been very serious\n\n3:27:44.740 --> 3:27:46.620\n about going deeper and deeper and deeper\n\n3:27:46.620 --> 3:27:49.780\n into my understanding of all of this,\n\n3:27:49.780 --> 3:27:52.020\n understanding the subtlety.\n\n3:27:52.020 --> 3:27:53.860\n At some point I was very angry\n\n3:27:53.860 --> 3:27:55.700\n about the liberators of Africa,\n\n3:27:55.700 --> 3:27:58.380\n because I was like, yes, you helped liberate us,\n\n3:27:58.380 --> 3:28:00.260\n but just to keep us in this mirrorism,\n\n3:28:01.180 --> 3:28:03.300\n I was angry for longest time.\n\n3:28:03.300 --> 3:28:07.780\n And then eventually you have to engage empathy and love\n\n3:28:08.660 --> 3:28:10.140\n to put yourself in their shoes\n\n3:28:10.140 --> 3:28:13.260\n and try to understand the time at which they were living.\n\n3:28:13.260 --> 3:28:14.500\n And that got me onto a journey\n\n3:28:14.500 --> 3:28:17.100\n of trying to understand history more.\n\n3:28:17.100 --> 3:28:19.340\n That's how I understood I was able to go beyond\n\n3:28:19.340 --> 3:28:21.980\n just these liberators and try to understand\n\n3:28:21.980 --> 3:28:23.580\n and rebuild the world around them\n\n3:28:23.580 --> 3:28:28.580\n at the macro and also at the macro level.\n\n3:28:29.140 --> 3:28:31.740\n Just really, you have to try to walk in their shoes.\n\n3:28:33.060 --> 3:28:36.780\n And from there, finally separate the baby with the bathwater\n\n3:28:36.780 --> 3:28:38.660\n that they were not able to do back then.\n\n3:28:38.660 --> 3:28:40.660\n That's why today, I'm sorry,\n\n3:28:40.660 --> 3:28:44.740\n but I have no patience for the BLM organizers, founders,\n\n3:28:44.740 --> 3:28:45.580\n especially the founders.\n\n3:28:45.580 --> 3:28:46.420\n I don't know what the organizers think,\n\n3:28:46.420 --> 3:28:48.780\n but the founders told us what they stand for.\n\n3:28:48.780 --> 3:28:51.820\n And I say, guys, don't make that same mistake again.\n\n3:28:51.820 --> 3:28:53.060\n If you're serious about this,\n\n3:28:53.060 --> 3:28:54.700\n you cannot make the same mistake.\n\n3:28:56.300 --> 3:29:00.260\n The liberals of Africa, they have an excuse.\n\n3:29:00.260 --> 3:29:01.100\n We didn't know better.\n\n3:29:01.100 --> 3:29:04.940\n It was so easy back then to conflate everything.\n\n3:29:04.940 --> 3:29:08.340\n But today, you, me, anybody alive\n\n3:29:08.340 --> 3:29:10.500\n cannot with a straight face\n\n3:29:10.500 --> 3:29:12.460\n embrace Marxist socialist ideas,\n\n3:29:12.460 --> 3:29:16.420\n especially, especially when they're claiming\n\n3:29:16.420 --> 3:29:20.340\n that they wanted people to thrive.\n\n3:29:20.340 --> 3:29:22.460\n No, you can't, I'm sorry.\n\n3:29:22.460 --> 3:29:26.060\n And I will hold your feet up to the fire on that one.\n\n3:29:26.060 --> 3:29:27.020\n I will, I will.\n\n3:29:27.020 --> 3:29:28.060\n And that's what I'm doing.\n\n3:29:28.060 --> 3:29:29.180\n They will give me a lot of grief for this,\n\n3:29:29.180 --> 3:29:30.020\n but guess what?\n\n3:29:30.020 --> 3:29:30.860\n I could care less.\n\n3:29:30.860 --> 3:29:32.460\n Do you know why I could care less?\n\n3:29:32.460 --> 3:29:34.500\n Because we have an entire population\n\n3:29:35.620 --> 3:29:40.380\n to help rise out of poverty into prosperity,\n\n3:29:40.380 --> 3:29:44.500\n where they become co creators,\n\n3:29:44.500 --> 3:29:47.300\n global co creators of innovation.\n\n3:29:47.300 --> 3:29:52.300\n And those ideas give you hope for the place you love,\n\n3:29:52.380 --> 3:29:54.260\n for Senegal, for Africa.\n\n3:29:54.260 --> 3:29:55.260\n They do.\n\n3:29:55.260 --> 3:29:56.100\n They do.\n\n3:29:56.100 --> 3:29:57.180\n The world I live in,\n\n3:29:59.140 --> 3:30:03.020\n the new centers of culture and fashion are in Dakar.\n\n3:30:03.020 --> 3:30:08.020\n The new centers of tech and, you know,\n\n3:30:10.060 --> 3:30:13.540\n crypto even is somewhere, maybe Nigeria.\n\n3:30:13.540 --> 3:30:16.380\n So you see that future, you see that future clearly.\n\n3:30:16.380 --> 3:30:18.900\n I do, I do, I do.\n\n3:30:18.900 --> 3:30:20.060\n It's a beautiful thing.\n\n3:30:20.060 --> 3:30:22.500\n And it's also beautiful to see that the space\n\n3:30:22.500 --> 3:30:24.900\n of these really powerful ideas\n\n3:30:24.900 --> 3:30:26.700\n is where you also found love.\n\n3:30:26.700 --> 3:30:27.540\n Right?\n\n3:30:27.540 --> 3:30:28.780\n So at the intersection.\n\n3:30:28.780 --> 3:30:31.820\n At the intersection, Michael and I would spend hours\n\n3:30:31.820 --> 3:30:33.100\n talking about all of these ideas.\n\n3:30:33.100 --> 3:30:34.660\n And I would be like, but what about this?\n\n3:30:34.660 --> 3:30:35.980\n No, it doesn't make any sense.\n\n3:30:35.980 --> 3:30:37.180\n No, no, no, oh no.\n\n3:30:37.180 --> 3:30:41.500\n And then hours, every single day for months, Lex.\n\n3:30:41.500 --> 3:30:42.420\n Yeah.\n\n3:30:42.420 --> 3:30:44.980\n And then from there, our love was born.\n\n3:30:44.980 --> 3:30:47.260\n Cause I tell people for us,\n\n3:30:47.260 --> 3:30:49.060\n love is not about looking at each other in the eyes,\n\n3:30:49.060 --> 3:30:50.460\n like, you know, they all think,\n\n3:30:50.460 --> 3:30:52.460\n but it's about, we look in one direction.\n\n3:30:52.460 --> 3:30:53.900\n And in this case, it's this vision,\n\n3:30:53.900 --> 3:30:55.860\n what we know to be possible and true.\n\n3:30:55.860 --> 3:30:58.420\n If only you liberate people.\n\n3:30:59.580 --> 3:31:01.860\n What we know to be true and possible.\n\n3:31:01.860 --> 3:31:04.820\n We, all of us are miracles walking around.\n\n3:31:04.820 --> 3:31:06.180\n Every time I get on a plane,\n\n3:31:06.180 --> 3:31:08.620\n it's a miracle of engineering.\n\n3:31:09.620 --> 3:31:11.100\n All the things we're able to do, you know,\n\n3:31:11.100 --> 3:31:13.340\n now when they do operation on your teeth,\n\n3:31:13.340 --> 3:31:16.660\n how they're able to put the pain down away.\n\n3:31:16.660 --> 3:31:17.980\n All of this is us.\n\n3:31:17.980 --> 3:31:20.380\n You're working on these robots.\n\n3:31:20.380 --> 3:31:22.860\n This, this, this inside here.\n\n3:31:22.860 --> 3:31:23.860\n Humans are amazing.\n\n3:31:23.860 --> 3:31:24.780\n I know.\n\n3:31:24.780 --> 3:31:27.220\n So that's why, and when it works in great tandem\n\n3:31:27.220 --> 3:31:30.380\n with this guy, these two working together.\n\n3:31:30.380 --> 3:31:31.220\n Yeah.\n\n3:31:31.220 --> 3:31:32.060\n Ooh.\n\n3:31:32.060 --> 3:31:32.900\n Watch out.\n\n3:31:32.900 --> 3:31:33.740\n There's nothing we can't accomplish.\n\n3:31:33.740 --> 3:31:35.180\n Nothing, nothing.\n\n3:31:35.180 --> 3:31:37.740\n Well, God, you're one of the most incredible people\n\n3:31:37.740 --> 3:31:38.580\n I've ever talked to.\n\n3:31:38.580 --> 3:31:39.740\n Oh, you say that.\n\n3:31:39.740 --> 3:31:40.580\n You're amazing.\n\n3:31:40.580 --> 3:31:41.420\n You've met everybody.\n\n3:31:41.420 --> 3:31:42.240\n Thank you so much.\n\n3:31:42.240 --> 3:31:43.500\n This is truly an honor.\n\n3:31:43.500 --> 3:31:44.580\n Thank you for everything you're doing.\n\n3:31:44.580 --> 3:31:46.820\n Thank you for the fire that burns within you.\n\n3:31:46.820 --> 3:31:48.500\n And there's just the passion you have\n\n3:31:48.500 --> 3:31:50.580\n for a place that's going to, I think,\n\n3:31:50.580 --> 3:31:52.020\n define the future of humanity.\n\n3:31:52.020 --> 3:31:53.300\n So thank you for everything you're doing.\n\n3:31:53.300 --> 3:31:54.140\n Thank you for talking to me.\n\n3:31:54.140 --> 3:31:54.980\n Thank you.\n\n3:31:54.980 --> 3:31:55.800\n Thank you to you.\n\n3:31:55.800 --> 3:31:57.740\n And sometimes I hope this fire doesn't consume me.\n\n3:31:57.740 --> 3:31:59.260\n That's how much it is.\n\n3:31:59.260 --> 3:32:02.340\n But I am grateful to you for this.\n\n3:32:02.340 --> 3:32:04.640\n And yeah, thank you for,\n\n3:32:04.640 --> 3:32:06.620\n I know you don't do a lot of these, you know,\n\n3:32:06.620 --> 3:32:09.060\n I am, it's this type of interviews.\n\n3:32:09.060 --> 3:32:11.660\n Maybe I don't know, but I'm so, so happy.\n\n3:32:11.660 --> 3:32:14.980\n You mean fun, inspiring, powerful interviews.\n\n3:32:14.980 --> 3:32:16.420\n Yes, I need to do more of that.\n\n3:32:16.420 --> 3:32:17.260\n You're amazing.\n\n3:32:17.260 --> 3:32:18.620\n I don't know, because at first I was like,\n\n3:32:18.620 --> 3:32:20.100\n Lex Friedman, really?\n\n3:32:20.100 --> 3:32:20.940\n Yeah, really?\n\n3:32:20.940 --> 3:32:21.780\n How's this going to go?\n\n3:32:21.780 --> 3:32:23.700\n I'm like, yeah, I'm going to talk to Lex\n\n3:32:23.700 --> 3:32:24.540\n and go all crazy.\n\n3:32:24.540 --> 3:32:27.700\n I think you need to work on your unconscious bias.\n\n3:32:27.700 --> 3:32:28.520\n Right.\n\n3:32:29.920 --> 3:32:30.760\n All right, thank you, Magat.\n\n3:32:30.760 --> 3:32:31.580\n You're the best.\n\n3:32:31.580 --> 3:32:32.420\n Thank you.\n\n3:32:32.420 --> 3:32:33.260\n Thank you.\n\n3:32:33.260 --> 3:32:34.560\n Thank you so much.\n\n3:32:34.560 --> 3:32:37.540\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Magat Wade.\n\n3:32:37.540 --> 3:32:38.780\n To support this podcast,\n\n3:32:38.780 --> 3:32:41.380\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n3:32:41.380 --> 3:32:43.580\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n3:32:43.580 --> 3:32:44.900\n from Nelson Mandela.\n\n3:32:46.000 --> 3:32:48.460\n Money won't create success.\n\n3:32:48.460 --> 3:32:51.060\n The freedom to make it will.\n\n3:32:51.060 --> 3:33:11.060\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
