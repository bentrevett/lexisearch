--> 00:09.200\n biotechnology, and geopolitics.\n\n00:09.200 --> 00:12.160\n In the past two years, he has been outspoken\n\n00:12.160 --> 00:15.240\n about the need to investigate and keep an open mind\n\n00:15.240 --> 00:18.200\n about the origins of COVID 19.\n\n00:18.200 --> 00:20.940\n In particular, he has been keeping an extensive\n\n00:20.940 --> 00:23.520\n up to date collection of circumstantial evidence\n\n00:23.520 --> 00:25.760\n in support of what is colloquially known\n\n00:25.760 --> 00:30.580\n as lab leak hypothesis that COVID 19 leaked in 2019\n\n00:30.580 --> 00:33.580\n from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\n00:33.580 --> 00:35.560\n In part, I wanted to explore the idea\n\n00:35.560 --> 00:37.920\n in response to the thoughtful criticism\n\n00:37.920 --> 00:40.760\n to parts of the Francis Collins episode.\n\n00:40.760 --> 00:43.780\n I will have more and more difficult conversations like this\n\n00:43.780 --> 00:45.840\n with people from all walks of life\n\n00:45.840 --> 00:47.800\n and with all kinds of ideas.\n\n00:47.800 --> 00:50.200\n I promise to do my best to keep an open mind\n\n00:50.200 --> 00:52.300\n and yet to ask hard questions\n\n00:52.300 --> 00:54.240\n while together searching for the beautiful\n\n00:54.240 --> 00:57.620\n and the inspiring in the mind of the other person.\n\n00:57.620 --> 00:59.920\n It's a hard line to walk gracefully,\n\n00:59.920 --> 01:01.640\n especially for someone like me,\n\n01:01.640 --> 01:03.520\n who's a bit of an awkward introvert\n\n01:03.520 --> 01:06.480\n with barely the grasp of the English language\n\n01:06.480 --> 01:10.200\n or any language, except maybe Python and C++.\n\n01:10.200 --> 01:13.920\n But I hope you stick around, be patient and empathetic\n\n01:13.920 --> 01:17.300\n and maybe learn something new together with me.\n\n01:17.300 --> 01:19.500\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:19.500 --> 01:21.640\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:21.640 --> 01:22.840\n in the description.\n\n01:22.840 --> 01:26.600\n And now, here's my conversation with Jamie Metzl.\n\n01:27.600 --> 01:29.560\n What is the probability in your mind\n\n01:29.560 --> 01:32.080\n that COVID 19 leaked from a lab?\n\n01:32.080 --> 01:35.960\n In your write up, I believe you said 85%.\n\n01:35.960 --> 01:37.720\n I know it's just a percentage.\n\n01:37.720 --> 01:39.840\n We can't really be exact with these kinds of things,\n\n01:39.840 --> 01:42.360\n but it gives us a sense where your mind is,\n\n01:42.360 --> 01:43.320\n where your intuition is.\n\n01:43.320 --> 01:46.960\n So as it stands today, what would you say is that probability?\n\n01:46.960 --> 01:48.960\n I would stand by what I've been saying\n\n01:48.960 --> 01:51.940\n since really the middle of last year.\n\n01:51.940 --> 01:55.600\n It's more likely and not, in my opinion,\n\n01:55.600 --> 01:56.880\n that the pandemic stems\n\n01:56.880 --> 01:59.400\n from an accidental lab incident in Wuhan.\n\n01:59.400 --> 02:04.200\n Is it 90%, is it 65%, I mean, that's kind of arbitrary.\n\n02:04.200 --> 02:08.120\n But when I stack up all of the available evidence\n\n02:08.120 --> 02:11.000\n and all of it on both sides is circumstantial,\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:14.400\n it weighs very significantly toward a lab incident origin.\n\n02:14.400 --> 02:17.920\n So before we dive into the specifics at a high level,\n\n02:17.920 --> 02:22.120\n what types of evidence, what intuition, what ideas\n\n02:22.120 --> 02:25.800\n are leading you to have that kind of estimate?\n\n02:25.800 --> 02:28.000\n Is it possible to kind of condense,\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:32.160\n when you look at the wall of evidence before you,\n\n02:32.160 --> 02:36.600\n where's your source, the strongest source of your intuition?\n\n02:36.600 --> 02:39.200\n And I would have to say it's just logic\n\n02:39.200 --> 02:40.600\n and deductive reasoning.\n\n02:40.600 --> 02:42.440\n So before I make the case for why I think\n\n02:42.440 --> 02:44.960\n it's most likely a lab incident origin,\n\n02:44.960 --> 02:46.700\n let's just say why it could be,\n\n02:46.700 --> 02:49.400\n and still could be a natural origin.\n\n02:49.400 --> 02:51.840\n All of this is a natural origin in the sense\n\n02:51.840 --> 02:56.840\n that it's a bat virus backbone, horseshoe bat virus backbone.\n\n02:56.960 --> 03:00.340\n Okay, I'm gonna keep pausing you to define stuff.\n\n03:00.340 --> 03:04.080\n So maybe it's useful to say, what do we mean by lab leak?\n\n03:04.080 --> 03:05.880\n What do we mean by natural origin?\n\n03:05.880 --> 03:07.760\n What do we mean by virus backbone?\n\n03:07.760 --> 03:09.760\n Okay, great questions.\n\n03:09.760 --> 03:11.400\n So viruses come from somewhere.\n\n03:11.400 --> 03:14.880\n Viruses have been around for 3.5 billion years,\n\n03:14.880 --> 03:17.800\n and they've been around for such a long time\n\n03:17.800 --> 03:20.680\n because they are adaptive and they're growing\n\n03:20.680 --> 03:23.600\n and they're always changing and they're morphing.\n\n03:23.600 --> 03:26.280\n And that's why viruses are,\n\n03:26.280 --> 03:29.480\n I mean, they've been very successful and we are our victims.\n\n03:29.480 --> 03:30.660\n Sometimes we're beneficiaries.\n\n03:30.660 --> 03:34.760\n We have viral DNA has morphed into our genomes,\n\n03:34.760 --> 03:37.680\n but now it's certainly in the case of COVID 19,\n\n03:37.680 --> 03:42.680\n we are victims of the success of viruses.\n\n03:42.680 --> 03:44.760\n And so when we talk about a backbone,\n\n03:44.760 --> 03:49.760\n so the SARS CoV2 virus, it has a history\n\n03:50.040 --> 03:52.640\n and these viruses don't come out of whole cloth.\n\n03:52.640 --> 03:54.640\n There are viruses that morph.\n\n03:54.640 --> 03:59.080\n And so we know that at some period,\n\n03:59.080 --> 04:02.000\n maybe 20 years ago or whatever,\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:07.000\n the virus that is SARS CoV2 existed in horseshoe bats.\n\n04:08.580 --> 04:13.120\n It was a horseshoe bat virus and it evolved somewhere.\n\n04:13.120 --> 04:15.640\n And there are some people who say,\n\n04:15.640 --> 04:16.920\n there's no evidence of this,\n\n04:16.920 --> 04:18.760\n but it's a plausible theory\n\n04:18.760 --> 04:21.040\n based on how things have happened in the past.\n\n04:21.040 --> 04:25.060\n Maybe that virus jumped from the horseshoe bat\n\n04:25.060 --> 04:27.120\n through some intermediate species.\n\n04:27.120 --> 04:29.040\n So it's like, let's say there's a bat\n\n04:29.040 --> 04:31.780\n and that it infects some other animal.\n\n04:31.780 --> 04:36.200\n Let's say it's a pig or a raccoon dog or a civet cat.\n\n04:36.200 --> 04:37.120\n They're all pangolin.\n\n04:37.120 --> 04:40.280\n They're all sorts of animals that have been considered.\n\n04:40.280 --> 04:43.880\n And then that virus adapts into that new host\n\n04:43.880 --> 04:45.960\n and it changes and grows.\n\n04:45.960 --> 04:48.120\n And then according to the quote unquote\n\n04:48.120 --> 04:49.520\n natural origins hypothesis,\n\n04:49.520 --> 04:53.140\n it jumps from that animal into humans.\n\n04:53.140 --> 04:55.120\n And so what you could imagine\n\n04:55.120 --> 04:57.000\n and some of the people who are making the case,\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:57.880\n all of the people actually,\n\n04:57.880 --> 05:00.960\n who are making the case for a natural origin of the virus,\n\n05:00.960 --> 05:03.440\n what they're saying is it went from bat\n\n05:03.440 --> 05:05.760\n to some intermediate species.\n\n05:05.760 --> 05:08.420\n And then from that intermediate species, most likely,\n\n05:08.420 --> 05:10.920\n there's some people who say it went directly bat to human,\n\n05:10.920 --> 05:13.040\n but through some intermediate species.\n\n05:13.040 --> 05:16.600\n And then humans interacted with that species.\n\n05:16.600 --> 05:20.000\n And then it jumped from that, whatever it is to humans.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:21.740\n And that's a very plausible theory.\n\n05:21.740 --> 05:23.320\n It's just that there's no evidence for it.\n\n05:23.320 --> 05:25.720\n And the nature of the interaction is,\n\n05:25.720 --> 05:29.680\n do most people kind of suggest this at the wet markets?\n\n05:29.680 --> 05:32.540\n So the interaction of the humans with the animal\n\n05:32.540 --> 05:35.300\n is in the form of it's either a live animal\n\n05:35.300 --> 05:39.640\n as being sold to be eaten or a recently live animal,\n\n05:39.640 --> 05:41.920\n but newly dead animal being sold to be eaten.\n\n05:41.920 --> 05:46.100\n That's certainly one very possible possibility,\n\n05:46.100 --> 05:48.900\n a possible possibility, I don't know if that's a word.\n\n05:48.900 --> 05:52.000\n But the people who believe in the wet market origin,\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:52.940\n that's what they're saying.\n\n05:52.940 --> 05:55.400\n So they had one of these animals,\n\n05:55.400 --> 05:57.880\n they were cutting it up, let's say, in a market\n\n05:57.880 --> 06:01.000\n and maybe some of the blood got into somebody's,\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:04.140\n maybe had a cut on their hand or maybe it was aerosolized\n\n06:04.140 --> 06:05.960\n and so somebody breathed it.\n\n06:05.960 --> 06:09.080\n And then that virus found this new host\n\n06:09.080 --> 06:11.600\n and that was the human host.\n\n06:11.600 --> 06:14.920\n But you could also have that happen in, let's say, a farm.\n\n06:14.920 --> 06:17.880\n So it's happened in the past that let's say\n\n06:17.880 --> 06:21.360\n that there are farms and because of human encroachment\n\n06:21.360 --> 06:24.920\n into wild spaces, we're pushing our farms\n\n06:24.920 --> 06:27.380\n and our animal farms further and further\n\n06:27.380 --> 06:30.880\n into what used to be just natural habitats.\n\n06:30.880 --> 06:33.000\n And so it's happened in the past, for example,\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.880\n that there were bats roosting over pig pens\n\n06:35.880 --> 06:38.920\n and the bat droppings went into the pig pens.\n\n06:38.920 --> 06:43.320\n The viruses in those droppings infected the pigs\n\n06:43.320 --> 06:45.960\n and then the pigs infected the humans.\n\n06:45.960 --> 06:48.520\n And that's why it's a plausible theory.\n\n06:48.520 --> 06:51.980\n It's just that there's basically no evidence for it.\n\n06:51.980 --> 06:56.660\n If it was the case that SARS CoV2 comes from this type\n\n06:56.660 --> 07:00.740\n of interaction, as in most of the at least recent\n\n07:00.740 --> 07:03.160\n past outbreaks, we'd see evidence of that.\n\n07:03.160 --> 07:05.200\n Viruses are messy.\n\n07:05.200 --> 07:07.960\n They're constantly undergoing Darwinian evolution\n\n07:07.960 --> 07:10.340\n and they're changing and it's not that they're just ready\n\n07:10.340 --> 07:13.800\n for prime time, ready to infect humans on day one.\n\n07:13.800 --> 07:18.400\n Normally you can trace the viral evolution prior\n\n07:18.400 --> 07:20.640\n to the time when it infects humans.\n\n07:20.640 --> 07:24.720\n But for SARS CoV2, it just showed up on the scene\n\n07:24.720 --> 07:26.740\n ready to infect humans.\n\n07:26.740 --> 07:30.600\n And there's no history that anybody has found so far\n\n07:30.600 --> 07:33.040\n of that kind of viral evolution.\n\n07:33.040 --> 07:35.600\n With the first SARS, you could track it\n\n07:35.600 --> 07:39.920\n by the genome sequencing that it was experimenting.\n\n07:39.920 --> 07:44.320\n And SARS CoV2 was very, very stable,\n\n07:44.320 --> 07:47.540\n meaning it had already adapted to humans\n\n07:47.540 --> 07:49.760\n by the time it interacted with us.\n\n07:49.760 --> 07:50.720\n It's fully adapted.\n\n07:50.720 --> 07:55.140\n So with SARS, there's a rapid evolution\n\n07:55.140 --> 07:58.520\n when it first kind of hooks onto a human.\n\n07:58.520 --> 07:59.680\n Yeah, because it's trying.\n\n07:59.680 --> 08:02.440\n Like a virus, its goal is to survive and replicate.\n\n08:02.440 --> 08:03.280\n Yeah, no, it's true.\n\n08:03.280 --> 08:04.400\n It's like, oh, we're gonna try this.\n\n08:04.400 --> 08:05.240\n Oh, that didn't work.\n\n08:05.240 --> 08:08.240\n We'll try it exactly like a startup.\n\n08:08.240 --> 08:10.400\n And so we don't see that.\n\n08:10.400 --> 08:11.960\n And so there are some people who say,\n\n08:11.960 --> 08:16.400\n well, one hypothesis is you have a totally isolated\n\n08:16.400 --> 08:18.880\n group of humans, maybe in Southern China,\n\n08:18.880 --> 08:22.860\n which is more than a thousand miles away from Wuhan.\n\n08:22.860 --> 08:26.840\n And maybe they're doing their animal farming\n\n08:26.840 --> 08:31.840\n right next to these areas where there are these horseshoe bats.\n\n08:31.920 --> 08:34.600\n And maybe in this totally isolated place\n\n08:34.600 --> 08:35.600\n that no one's ever heard of,\n\n08:35.600 --> 08:37.860\n they're not connected to any other place,\n\n08:37.860 --> 08:39.740\n one person gets infected.\n\n08:40.760 --> 08:42.400\n And it doesn't spread to anybody else\n\n08:42.400 --> 08:44.080\n because they're so isolated.\n\n08:44.080 --> 08:45.720\n They're like, I don't know.\n\n08:45.720 --> 08:48.120\n I can't even imagine that this is the case.\n\n08:48.120 --> 08:52.560\n Then somebody gets in a car and drives all night,\n\n08:52.560 --> 08:55.400\n more than a thousand miles through crappy roads\n\n08:55.400 --> 08:57.560\n to get to Wuhan, doesn't stop for anything,\n\n08:57.560 --> 08:59.120\n doesn't infect anybody on the way.\n\n08:59.120 --> 09:01.880\n No one else in that person's village infects anyone.\n\n09:01.880 --> 09:03.560\n And then that person goes straight\n\n09:03.560 --> 09:05.720\n to the Huanan seafood market,\n\n09:05.720 --> 09:09.280\n according to this, in my mind, not very credible theory,\n\n09:09.280 --> 09:12.640\n and then unloads his stuff and everybody gets infected.\n\n09:12.640 --> 09:15.240\n And they're only delivering those animals\n\n09:15.240 --> 09:18.800\n to the Wuhan market, which doesn't even sell very many\n\n09:18.800 --> 09:20.240\n of these kinds of animals\n\n09:20.240 --> 09:23.120\n that are likely intermediate species and not anywhere else.\n\n09:23.120 --> 09:25.900\n So that's, I mean, it's a little bit of a straw man,\n\n09:26.880 --> 09:29.200\n but on top of that, the Chinese have sequenced\n\n09:29.200 --> 09:32.420\n more than 80,000 animal samples,\n\n09:32.420 --> 09:36.280\n and there's no evidence of this type of viral evolution\n\n09:36.280 --> 09:37.400\n that we would otherwise expect.\n\n09:37.400 --> 09:42.400\n Let's try to, at this moment, steel man the argument\n\n09:43.920 --> 09:46.400\n for the natural origin of the virus.\n\n09:46.400 --> 09:50.240\n So just to clarify, so Wuhan is actually,\n\n09:50.240 --> 09:52.200\n despite what it might sound like to people,\n\n09:52.200 --> 09:53.920\n is a pretty big city.\n\n09:53.920 --> 09:55.140\n There's a lot of people that live in it.\n\n09:55.140 --> 09:55.980\n 11 million.\n\n09:55.980 --> 09:59.640\n So not only is there, at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,\n\n09:59.640 --> 10:03.960\n there's other centers that do work on viruses,\n\n10:03.960 --> 10:06.600\n but there's also a giant number of markets.\n\n10:06.600 --> 10:08.000\n And everything we're talking about here\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.560\n is pretty close together.\n\n10:09.560 --> 10:13.640\n So when I kind of look at the geography of this,\n\n10:13.640 --> 10:16.000\n I think when you zoom out, it's all Wuhan,\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:17.280\n but when you zoom in,\n\n10:17.280 --> 10:19.240\n there's just a lot of interesting dynamics\n\n10:19.240 --> 10:21.600\n that could be happening and what the cases are popping up\n\n10:21.600 --> 10:24.040\n and what's being reported, all that kind of stuff.\n\n10:24.040 --> 10:29.040\n So I think the people that argue for the natural origin,\n\n10:29.560 --> 10:31.560\n and there's a few recent papers\n\n10:31.560 --> 10:32.960\n that come out arguing this,\n\n10:33.880 --> 10:35.640\n it's kind of fascinating to watch this whole thing,\n\n10:35.640 --> 10:36.920\n but I think what they're arguing\n\n10:36.920 --> 10:39.060\n is that there's this Hunan market\n\n10:39.060 --> 10:44.060\n that's one of the major markets, the wet markets in Wuhan,\n\n10:45.420 --> 10:49.160\n that there's a bunch of cases\n\n10:49.160 --> 10:51.680\n that were reported from there.\n\n10:52.560 --> 10:54.200\n So if I look at, for example,\n\n10:54.200 --> 10:58.980\n the Michael Warby perspective that he wrote in Science,\n\n10:58.980 --> 11:01.940\n he argues, he wrote this a few days ago,\n\n11:01.940 --> 11:06.600\n the predominance of early COVID cases linked to Hunan market,\n\n11:06.600 --> 11:09.800\n and this can't be dismissed as ascertainment bias,\n\n11:09.800 --> 11:11.120\n which I think is what people argue,\n\n11:11.120 --> 11:13.340\n that you're just kind of focusing on this region\n\n11:13.340 --> 11:14.400\n because a lot of cases came,\n\n11:14.400 --> 11:18.280\n but there could be a huge number of other cases.\n\n11:18.280 --> 11:19.760\n So people who argue against this\n\n11:19.760 --> 11:22.660\n say that this is a later stage already.\n\n11:24.880 --> 11:29.760\n So he says no, he says this is the epicenter,\n\n11:29.760 --> 11:34.760\n and this is a clear evidence, circumstantial evidence,\n\n11:36.500 --> 11:37.920\n but evidence nevertheless\n\n11:37.920 --> 11:42.320\n that this is where the jump happened to humans,\n\n11:42.320 --> 11:44.720\n the big explosion, maybe not case zero,\n\n11:44.720 --> 11:47.400\n I don't know if he argues that, but the early cases.\n\n11:47.400 --> 11:49.160\n So what do you make of this whole idea?\n\n11:49.160 --> 11:52.480\n Can you steel man it before we talk about the alternative?\n\n11:52.480 --> 11:56.160\n And my goal here isn't to attack people on the other side,\n\n11:56.160 --> 12:00.760\n and my feeling is if there is evidence that's presented\n\n12:00.760 --> 12:02.840\n that should change my view,\n\n12:02.840 --> 12:06.520\n I hope that I'll be open minded enough to change my view.\n\n12:06.520 --> 12:09.400\n And certainly Michael Warby is a thoughtful person,\n\n12:09.400 --> 12:11.200\n a respected scientist,\n\n12:11.200 --> 12:14.080\n and I think this work is contributive work,\n\n12:14.080 --> 12:19.080\n but I just don't think that it's as significant\n\n12:19.720 --> 12:22.640\n as has been reported in the press.\n\n12:22.640 --> 12:24.880\n And so what his argument is,\n\n12:24.880 --> 12:29.880\n is that there is an early cluster in December of 2019\n\n12:30.420 --> 12:33.360\n around the Huanan seafood market.\n\n12:33.360 --> 12:36.400\n And even though he himself argues\n\n12:36.400 --> 12:39.560\n that the original breakthrough case,\n\n12:39.560 --> 12:41.520\n the original case, the index case\n\n12:41.520 --> 12:46.160\n where the first person infected happened earlier,\n\n12:46.160 --> 12:49.800\n happened in October or November, so not in December.\n\n12:49.800 --> 12:52.880\n His argument is, well, what are the odds\n\n12:52.880 --> 12:56.480\n that you would have this number, this cluster of cases\n\n12:56.480 --> 12:58.080\n in the Huanan seafood market,\n\n12:58.080 --> 13:00.940\n and if the origin happened someplace else,\n\n13:00.940 --> 13:03.280\n wouldn't you expect other clusters?\n\n13:03.280 --> 13:06.160\n And it's not an entirely implausible argument,\n\n13:06.160 --> 13:08.040\n but there are reasons why I think\n\n13:08.040 --> 13:11.400\n that this is not nearly as determinative\n\n13:11.400 --> 13:12.800\n as has been reported.\n\n13:12.800 --> 13:14.240\n And I certainly had a lot of,\n\n13:14.240 --> 13:17.640\n I and others had tweeted a lot about this.\n\n13:17.640 --> 13:21.600\n And that is first, the people who were infected\n\n13:21.600 --> 13:26.520\n in this cluster, it's not the earliest known virus\n\n13:26.520 --> 13:28.560\n of the SARS CoV2, it began mutating.\n\n13:28.560 --> 13:31.840\n So this is, it's not the original SARS CoV2 there.\n\n13:31.840 --> 13:34.640\n So it had to have happened someplace else.\n\n13:34.640 --> 13:38.560\n Two, the people who were infected in the market\n\n13:38.560 --> 13:41.520\n weren't infected in the part of the market\n\n13:41.520 --> 13:43.700\n where they had these kinds of animals\n\n13:43.700 --> 13:46.240\n that are considered to be candidates\n\n13:46.240 --> 13:49.440\n as an intermediary species.\n\n13:49.440 --> 13:51.760\n And third, there was a bias,\n\n13:51.760 --> 13:53.160\n and actually I'll have four things.\n\n13:53.160 --> 13:58.160\n Third, there was a bias in the early assessment in China\n\n13:58.200 --> 13:59.720\n of what they were looking for.\n\n13:59.720 --> 14:02.320\n They were asked, did you have exposure to the market?\n\n14:02.320 --> 14:03.360\n Because I think in the early days\n\n14:03.360 --> 14:05.120\n when people were figuring things out,\n\n14:05.120 --> 14:08.720\n that was one of the questions that was asked.\n\n14:08.720 --> 14:11.480\n And fourth, and probably most significantly,\n\n14:11.480 --> 14:14.440\n we have so little information\n\n14:14.440 --> 14:16.920\n about those early cases in China,\n\n14:16.920 --> 14:18.520\n and that's really unfortunate.\n\n14:18.520 --> 14:19.760\n I know we'll talk about this later\n\n14:19.760 --> 14:23.000\n because the Chinese government is preventing access\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:26.080\n to all of that information, which they have,\n\n14:26.080 --> 14:28.880\n which could easily help us get to the bottom,\n\n14:28.880 --> 14:31.840\n at least know a ton more about how this pandemic started.\n\n14:31.840 --> 14:36.840\n And so this is, it's like grasping at straws\n\n14:36.960 --> 14:38.440\n in the dark with gloves on.\n\n14:38.440 --> 14:39.660\n That's right.\n\n14:39.660 --> 14:41.720\n But to steel man the argument,\n\n14:41.720 --> 14:45.040\n we have this evidence from this market,\n\n14:45.040 --> 14:47.000\n and yes, the Chinese government\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.960\n has turned off the lights essentially,\n\n14:48.960 --> 14:51.320\n so we have very little data to work with,\n\n14:51.320 --> 14:53.440\n but this is the data we have.\n\n14:53.440 --> 14:55.560\n So who's to say that this data\n\n14:55.560 --> 14:58.880\n doesn't represent a much bigger data set\n\n14:58.880 --> 15:01.560\n that a lot of people got infected at this market\n\n15:01.560 --> 15:04.960\n where even at the parts, or especially at the parts\n\n15:04.960 --> 15:09.160\n where the infected meat was being sold?\n\n15:09.160 --> 15:13.640\n So that could be true, and it probably is true.\n\n15:13.640 --> 15:16.840\n The question is, is this the source?\n\n15:16.840 --> 15:18.740\n Is this the place where this began?\n\n15:18.740 --> 15:22.000\n Or was this just a place where it was amplified?\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:26.640\n And I certainly think that it's extremely likely\n\n15:26.640 --> 15:31.240\n that the Huanan seafood market was a point of amplification.\n\n15:31.240 --> 15:33.000\n And it's just answering a different question.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.320\n Basically what you're saying is it's very difficult\n\n15:35.320 --> 15:38.200\n to use the market as evidence for anything\n\n15:38.200 --> 15:42.720\n because it's probably not even the starting point.\n\n15:42.720 --> 15:45.800\n So it's just a good place for it to continue spreading.\n\n15:45.800 --> 15:47.560\n That's certainly my view.\n\n15:47.560 --> 15:51.840\n What Michael Warby's argument is, Marco, is that,\n\n15:51.840 --> 15:53.140\n well, what are the odds of that?\n\n15:53.140 --> 15:57.000\n That we're seeing this amplification in the market.\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:00.240\n And if we, let me put it this way.\n\n16:00.240 --> 16:02.520\n If we had all of the information,\n\n16:02.520 --> 16:06.000\n if the Chinese government hadn't blocked access\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.480\n to all of this, because there's blood bank information,\n\n16:08.480 --> 16:10.600\n there's all sorts of information,\n\n16:10.600 --> 16:14.980\n and based on a full and complete understanding,\n\n16:14.980 --> 16:18.360\n we came to believe that all of the early cases\n\n16:18.360 --> 16:19.500\n were at this market.\n\n16:19.500 --> 16:22.280\n I think that would be a stronger argument\n\n16:22.280 --> 16:23.980\n than what this is so far.\n\n16:23.980 --> 16:26.720\n But everything leads to the fact that why is it\n\n16:26.720 --> 16:28.640\n that the Chinese government,\n\n16:28.640 --> 16:31.240\n which was, frankly, after a slow start,\n\n16:31.240 --> 16:36.240\n the gold standard of doing viral tracking for SARS 1,\n\n16:36.720 --> 16:39.840\n why have they apparently done so little\n\n16:39.840 --> 16:41.140\n and shared so little?\n\n16:41.140 --> 16:45.040\n I think it asks, it begs a lot of questions.\n\n16:45.040 --> 16:48.920\n Okay, so let's then talk about the Chinese government.\n\n16:50.220 --> 16:51.960\n There's several governments, right?\n\n16:51.960 --> 16:54.340\n So one is the local government of Wuhan.\n\n16:55.560 --> 16:56.720\n And not just the Chinese government.\n\n16:56.720 --> 16:59.040\n Let's talk about government.\n\n16:59.040 --> 17:00.820\n No, let's talk about human nature.\n\n17:02.160 --> 17:03.480\n Let's just keep zooming out.\n\n17:03.480 --> 17:04.920\n Let's talk about planet Earth.\n\n17:04.920 --> 17:08.440\n No, so there's the Wuhan local government.\n\n17:08.440 --> 17:12.540\n There's the Chinese government led by Xi Jinping.\n\n17:13.840 --> 17:16.480\n And there's governments in general.\n\n17:16.480 --> 17:18.080\n I'm trying to empathize.\n\n17:18.080 --> 17:21.440\n So my father was involved with Chernobyl.\n\n17:21.440 --> 17:25.680\n I'm trying to put myself into the mind of local officials,\n\n17:25.680 --> 17:27.120\n of people who are like,\n\n17:27.120 --> 17:32.120\n oh shit, there's a potential catastrophic event\n\n17:32.280 --> 17:36.320\n happening here and it's my ass\n\n17:36.320 --> 17:39.600\n because there's incompetence all over the place.\n\n17:39.600 --> 17:41.600\n Yeah, human nature is such that there's incompetence\n\n17:41.600 --> 17:44.600\n all over the place and you're always trying to cover it up.\n\n17:44.600 --> 17:47.120\n And so given that context,\n\n17:48.320 --> 17:52.720\n I want to lay out all the possible incompetence,\n\n17:52.720 --> 17:54.980\n all the possible malevolence,\n\n17:54.980 --> 17:58.600\n all the possible geopolitical tensions here.\n\n18:01.280 --> 18:06.280\n All right, where in your sense did the coverup start?\n\n18:06.400 --> 18:10.840\n So there's this suspicious fact,\n\n18:13.280 --> 18:16.720\n it seems like that the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n18:16.720 --> 18:19.200\n had a public database of thousands\n\n18:19.200 --> 18:22.640\n of sampled bad coronavirus sequences\n\n18:22.640 --> 18:26.320\n and that went offline in September of 2019.\n\n18:26.320 --> 18:28.220\n What's that about?\n\n18:28.220 --> 18:30.560\n So let me talk about that specific\n\n18:30.560 --> 18:33.600\n and then I'll also follow your path of zooming out\n\n18:33.600 --> 18:34.560\n and it's a really important.\n\n18:34.560 --> 18:35.400\n Is that a good starting point?\n\n18:35.400 --> 18:37.080\n It's a great starting point, yeah, yeah.\n\n18:37.080 --> 18:40.440\n So but there's a bigger story\n\n18:40.440 --> 18:42.560\n but let me talk about that.\n\n18:42.560 --> 18:45.280\n So the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n18:46.500 --> 18:48.080\n and we can go into the whole history\n\n18:48.080 --> 18:50.360\n of the Wuhan Institute of Virology either now or later\n\n18:50.360 --> 18:52.220\n because I think it's very relevant to the story\n\n18:52.220 --> 18:55.440\n but let's focus for now on this database.\n\n18:55.440 --> 19:00.400\n They had a database of 22,000 viral samples\n\n19:00.400 --> 19:02.840\n and sequence information about viruses\n\n19:02.840 --> 19:05.080\n that they had collected.\n\n19:05.080 --> 19:07.660\n Some of which, the collection of some of which\n\n19:07.660 --> 19:10.400\n was supported through funding from the NIH,\n\n19:10.400 --> 19:12.800\n not a huge NIH through the EcoHealth Alliance.\n\n19:12.800 --> 19:17.800\n It's a relatively small amount, $600,000 but not nothing.\n\n19:18.080 --> 19:20.880\n The goal of this database\n\n19:20.880 --> 19:24.400\n was so that we could understand viral evolution\n\n19:24.400 --> 19:27.360\n so that exactly for this kind of moment\n\n19:27.360 --> 19:29.680\n where we had an unknown virus,\n\n19:29.680 --> 19:31.960\n we could say, well, is this like anything\n\n19:31.960 --> 19:33.440\n that we've seen before?\n\n19:33.440 --> 19:35.880\n And that would help us both understand what we're facing\n\n19:35.880 --> 19:39.420\n and be better able to respond.\n\n19:39.420 --> 19:44.420\n So this was a password protected public access database.\n\n19:45.060 --> 19:50.060\n In 2019, in September 2019,\n\n19:50.060 --> 19:52.620\n it became inaccessible and then the whole,\n\n19:52.620 --> 19:55.900\n a few months later, the entire database disappeared.\n\n19:55.900 --> 20:00.060\n What the Chinese have said is that because there were\n\n20:00.060 --> 20:03.060\n all kinds of computer attacks on this database\n\n20:03.060 --> 20:07.060\n but why would that happen in September 2019\n\n20:07.060 --> 20:11.500\n before the pandemic, at least as far as we know.\n\n20:11.500 --> 20:13.580\n So just to clarify.\n\n20:13.580 --> 20:14.460\n Yes.\n\n20:14.460 --> 20:17.460\n It went down to September 2019\n\n20:17.460 --> 20:19.700\n just so we get the year straight.\n\n20:19.700 --> 20:22.140\n January 2020 is when the virus\n\n20:22.140 --> 20:25.980\n really started getting the press.\n\n20:25.980 --> 20:29.020\n So we're talking about December 2019,\n\n20:29.020 --> 20:30.980\n a lot of early infections happened.\n\n20:30.980 --> 20:34.900\n September 2019 is when this database goes down.\n\n20:34.900 --> 20:37.260\n Just to clarify because you said it quickly,\n\n20:37.260 --> 20:39.580\n the Chinese government said\n\n20:39.580 --> 20:44.000\n that their database was getting hacked.\n\n20:44.900 --> 20:48.660\n Therefore, Xu Zhengli, the director of this part\n\n20:48.660 --> 20:50.820\n of the Wuhan Institute of Virology said that.\n\n20:50.820 --> 20:53.260\n Oh really, she was the one that said it?\n\n20:53.260 --> 20:54.100\n She was the one who said it.\n\n20:54.100 --> 20:56.420\n Oh boy, I did not even know that part.\n\n20:56.420 --> 20:57.240\n Yeah.\n\n20:57.240 --> 20:58.620\n Well, she's an interesting character.\n\n20:58.620 --> 20:59.460\n We'll talk about her.\n\n20:59.460 --> 21:00.300\n Yeah.\n\n21:00.300 --> 21:05.300\n So the excuse is that it's getting cyber attacked a lot\n\n21:07.700 --> 21:10.820\n so we're gonna take it down without any further explanation\n\n21:10.820 --> 21:12.140\n which seems very suspicious.\n\n21:12.140 --> 21:15.620\n And then this virus starts to emerge\n\n21:15.620 --> 21:17.500\n in October, November, December.\n\n21:17.500 --> 21:19.500\n There's a lot of argument about that, but after.\n\n21:19.500 --> 21:21.420\n Sorry to interrupt, but some people are saying\n\n21:21.420 --> 21:23.220\n that the first outbreak could have happened\n\n21:23.220 --> 21:25.140\n as early as September.\n\n21:25.140 --> 21:27.640\n I think it's more likely it's October, November,\n\n21:27.640 --> 21:31.340\n but for the people who are saying that the first outbreak,\n\n21:31.340 --> 21:34.940\n the first incident of a known outbreak,\n\n21:34.940 --> 21:37.360\n at least to somebody, happened in September,\n\n21:37.360 --> 21:40.440\n they make the argument, well, what if that also happened\n\n21:40.440 --> 21:42.460\n in mid September of 2019?\n\n21:42.460 --> 21:43.800\n I'm not prepared to go there,\n\n21:43.800 --> 21:45.100\n but there are some people who make that argument.\n\n21:45.100 --> 21:47.980\n But I think, again, if I were to put myself\n\n21:47.980 --> 21:50.060\n in the mind of officials,\n\n21:50.060 --> 21:53.740\n whether it's officials within the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n21:53.740 --> 21:55.860\n or Wuhan local officials,\n\n21:58.020 --> 22:02.020\n I think if I notice some major problem,\n\n22:02.020 --> 22:03.540\n like somebody got sick,\n\n22:04.460 --> 22:09.220\n some sign of, oh shit, we screwed up,\n\n22:09.220 --> 22:11.940\n that's when you kind of do the slow,\n\n22:11.940 --> 22:13.740\n there's like a Homer Simpson meme\n\n22:13.740 --> 22:15.580\n where you slowly start backing out,\n\n22:15.580 --> 22:20.580\n and I would probably start hiding stuff.\n\n22:20.740 --> 22:21.860\n CYA, yeah.\n\n22:21.860 --> 22:25.980\n Yeah, and then coming up with really shady excuses.\n\n22:25.980 --> 22:27.900\n It's like you're in a relationship\n\n22:27.900 --> 22:30.020\n and your girlfriend wants to see your phone,\n\n22:30.020 --> 22:31.400\n and you're like, I'm sorry,\n\n22:31.400 --> 22:33.540\n I'm just getting attacked by the Russians now.\n\n22:33.540 --> 22:35.340\n The cyber security issue, I can't.\n\n22:35.340 --> 22:36.820\n Yeah, I wish I could.\n\n22:36.820 --> 22:39.780\n I wish I could, it's just unsafe right now.\n\n22:39.780 --> 22:42.820\n So would it be okay if I give you my kind of macro view\n\n22:42.820 --> 22:44.620\n of the whole information space\n\n22:44.620 --> 22:48.300\n and why I believe this has been so contentious?\n\n22:50.660 --> 22:52.460\n If I had to give my best guess,\n\n22:52.460 --> 22:56.020\n and I underline the word guess of what happened,\n\n22:56.020 --> 22:59.540\n and your background, your family background with Chernobyl\n\n22:59.540 --> 23:02.100\n I think is highly relevant here.\n\n23:02.100 --> 23:06.340\n So after the first SARS, there was a recognition\n\n23:06.340 --> 23:09.860\n that we needed to distribute knowledge about virology\n\n23:09.860 --> 23:11.660\n and epidemiology around the world,\n\n23:11.660 --> 23:14.900\n that people in China and Africa and Southeast Asia,\n\n23:14.900 --> 23:16.700\n they were the frontline workers,\n\n23:16.700 --> 23:20.620\n and they needed to be doing a lot of the viral monitoring\n\n23:20.620 --> 23:24.760\n and assessment so that we could have an early alarm system.\n\n23:25.660 --> 23:28.260\n And that was why there was a lot of investment\n\n23:28.260 --> 23:30.980\n in all of those places in building capacity\n\n23:30.980 --> 23:31.980\n and training people\n\n23:31.980 --> 23:34.620\n and helping to build institutional capacity.\n\n23:34.620 --> 23:36.780\n And the Chinese government,\n\n23:36.780 --> 23:40.540\n they recognized that they needed to ramp things up.\n\n23:40.540 --> 23:43.300\n And then the World Health Organization\n\n23:43.300 --> 23:44.660\n and the World Health Assembly,\n\n23:44.660 --> 23:47.620\n they had their international health regulations\n\n23:47.620 --> 23:50.140\n that were designed to create a stronger infrastructure.\n\n23:50.140 --> 23:52.540\n So that was the goal.\n\n23:52.540 --> 23:54.320\n There were a lot of investments,\n\n23:54.320 --> 23:55.420\n and I know we'll talk later\n\n23:55.420 --> 23:56.940\n about the Wuhan Institute of Virology,\n\n23:56.940 --> 23:59.420\n and I won't go into that right now.\n\n23:59.420 --> 24:02.620\n So there was all of this distributed capacity.\n\n24:02.620 --> 24:07.300\n And so in the early days, there's a breakout in Wuhan.\n\n24:07.300 --> 24:10.740\n We don't know, is it September, October, November?\n\n24:10.740 --> 24:14.640\n Maybe December is when the local authorities\n\n24:14.640 --> 24:16.700\n start to recognize that something's happening.\n\n24:16.700 --> 24:19.260\n But at some point in late 2019,\n\n24:19.260 --> 24:23.580\n local officials in Wuhan understand that something is up.\n\n24:23.580 --> 24:26.060\n And exactly like in Chernobyl,\n\n24:26.060 --> 24:29.220\n these guys exist within a hierarchical system,\n\n24:29.220 --> 24:32.340\n and they are going to be rewarded if good things happen,\n\n24:32.340 --> 24:34.000\n and they're going to be in big trouble\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.280\n if bad things happen under their watch.\n\n24:36.280 --> 24:39.580\n So their initial instinct is to squash it.\n\n24:39.580 --> 24:42.200\n And my guess is they think,\n\n24:42.200 --> 24:44.340\n well, if we squash this information,\n\n24:44.340 --> 24:47.180\n we can most likely beat back this outbreak,\n\n24:47.180 --> 24:49.380\n because lots of outbreaks happen all the time,\n\n24:49.380 --> 24:51.500\n including of SARS 1,\n\n24:51.500 --> 24:53.980\n where there was multiple lab incidents\n\n24:53.980 --> 24:56.860\n out of a lab in Beijing.\n\n24:56.860 --> 24:59.820\n And so they start their coverup on day one.\n\n24:59.820 --> 25:02.620\n They start screening social media.\n\n25:02.620 --> 25:06.180\n They send nasty letters to different doctors\n\n25:06.180 --> 25:08.660\n and others who are starting to speak up.\n\n25:08.660 --> 25:12.120\n But then it becomes clear that there's a bigger issue.\n\n25:12.120 --> 25:14.820\n And then the national government of China,\n\n25:14.820 --> 25:17.500\n again, this is just a hypothesis,\n\n25:17.500 --> 25:19.700\n the national government gets involved.\n\n25:19.700 --> 25:21.920\n They say, all right, this is getting much bigger.\n\n25:21.920 --> 25:24.100\n They go in and they realize\n\n25:24.100 --> 25:26.200\n that we have a big problem on our hands.\n\n25:26.200 --> 25:28.340\n They relatively quickly know\n\n25:28.340 --> 25:30.680\n that it's spreading human to human.\n\n25:30.680 --> 25:32.900\n And so the right thing for them to do then\n\n25:32.900 --> 25:35.380\n is what the South African government is doing now\n\n25:35.380 --> 25:37.860\n is to say, we have this outbreak.\n\n25:37.860 --> 25:40.820\n We don't know everything, but we know it's serious.\n\n25:40.820 --> 25:41.680\n We need help.\n\n25:41.680 --> 25:44.780\n But that's not the instinct of people in most governments\n\n25:44.780 --> 25:48.340\n and certainly not in authoritarian governments like China.\n\n25:48.340 --> 25:50.980\n And so the national government,\n\n25:50.980 --> 25:52.820\n they have a choice at that point.\n\n25:52.820 --> 25:55.060\n They can do option one,\n\n25:55.060 --> 25:57.540\n which is what we would hear called the right thing,\n\n25:57.540 --> 25:59.620\n which is total transparency.\n\n25:59.620 --> 26:03.460\n They criticize the local officials for having this coverup.\n\n26:03.460 --> 26:05.860\n And they say, now we're going to be totally transparent.\n\n26:05.860 --> 26:07.980\n But what does that do in a system\n\n26:07.980 --> 26:10.740\n like the former Soviet Union, like China now?\n\n26:10.740 --> 26:12.460\n If local officials say, wait a second,\n\n26:12.460 --> 26:15.940\n I thought my job was to cover everything up,\n\n26:15.940 --> 26:18.340\n to support this alternative reality\n\n26:18.340 --> 26:22.280\n that authoritarian systems need in order to survive.\n\n26:22.280 --> 26:23.860\n Well, now I'm gonna be held accountable\n\n26:23.860 --> 26:26.740\n for if I'm not totally transparent,\n\n26:26.740 --> 26:29.420\n like your whole system would collapse.\n\n26:29.420 --> 26:32.580\n So the national government, they have that choice\n\n26:32.580 --> 26:37.260\n and their only choice according to the logic of their system\n\n26:37.260 --> 26:39.020\n is to be all in on a coverup.\n\n26:39.020 --> 26:41.620\n And that's why they block the World Health Organization\n\n26:41.620 --> 26:45.520\n from sending its team to Wuhan for over three weeks.\n\n26:45.520 --> 26:48.580\n They overtly lie to the World Health Organization\n\n26:48.580 --> 26:51.280\n about human to human transmission.\n\n26:51.280 --> 26:53.580\n And then they begin their coverups.\n\n26:53.580 --> 26:56.900\n So they begin very, very quickly destroying samples,\n\n26:56.900 --> 26:59.860\n hiding records, they start imprisoning people\n\n26:59.860 --> 27:02.900\n for asking basic questions.\n\n27:02.900 --> 27:05.780\n Soon after they establish a gag order,\n\n27:05.780 --> 27:08.060\n preventing Chinese scientists from writing\n\n27:08.060 --> 27:10.600\n or saying anything about pandemic origins\n\n27:10.600 --> 27:12.200\n without prior government approval.\n\n27:12.200 --> 27:16.180\n And what that does means that there isn't a lot of data,\n\n27:16.180 --> 27:19.300\n there's not nearly enough data coming out of China.\n\n27:19.300 --> 27:22.860\n And so lots of responsible scientists outside of China\n\n27:22.860 --> 27:25.040\n who are data driven say, well,\n\n27:25.040 --> 27:29.300\n I don't have enough information to draw conclusions.\n\n27:29.300 --> 27:34.300\n And then into that vacuum step a relatively small number\n\n27:35.180 --> 27:39.220\n of largely virologists, but also others,\n\n27:39.220 --> 27:40.820\n respected scientists.\n\n27:40.820 --> 27:43.220\n And I know we'll talk about the, I think,\n\n27:43.220 --> 27:47.060\n infamous Peter Daszak who say,\n\n27:47.060 --> 27:52.060\n well, without any real foundation in the evidence,\n\n27:52.780 --> 27:56.780\n they say, we know pretty much this comes from nature\n\n27:56.780 --> 28:00.300\n and anyone who's raising the possibility\n\n28:00.300 --> 28:03.420\n of a lab incident origin is a conspiracy theorist.\n\n28:03.420 --> 28:07.940\n So that message starts to percolate.\n\n28:07.940 --> 28:11.620\n And then in the United States, we have Donald Trump\n\n28:11.620 --> 28:15.440\n and he's starting to get criticized for America's failure\n\n28:15.440 --> 28:17.680\n to respond, prepare for and respond adequately\n\n28:17.680 --> 28:19.060\n to the outbreak.\n\n28:19.060 --> 28:22.900\n And so he starts saying, well, I know first\n\n28:22.900 --> 28:25.160\n after praising Xi Jinping, he starts saying,\n\n28:25.160 --> 28:28.620\n well, I know that China did it and the WHO did it\n\n28:28.620 --> 28:33.020\n and he's kind of pointing fingers at everybody but himself.\n\n28:33.020 --> 28:36.140\n And then we have a media here that had shifted\n\n28:36.140 --> 28:40.760\n from the traditional model of he said, she said journalism,\n\n28:40.760 --> 28:43.220\n so and so said X and so and so said Y\n\n28:43.220 --> 28:45.860\n and then we'll present both of those views.\n\n28:45.860 --> 28:47.460\n With Donald Trump,\n\n28:47.460 --> 28:50.600\n he would make outlandish starting positions.\n\n28:50.600 --> 28:53.460\n So he would say, Lex is an ax murderer.\n\n28:53.460 --> 28:55.380\n And then in the early days, they would say,\n\n28:55.380 --> 28:59.180\n Lex is an ax murderer, Lex's friend says\n\n28:59.180 --> 29:01.340\n he's not an ax murderer and we have a four day debate,\n\n29:01.340 --> 29:02.580\n is he or isn't he?\n\n29:02.580 --> 29:04.660\n And then at day four, someone would say,\n\n29:04.660 --> 29:06.820\n why are we having this debate at all?\n\n29:06.820 --> 29:11.780\n Because the original point is just is baseless.\n\n29:11.780 --> 29:13.860\n And so the media just got in the habit,\n\n29:13.860 --> 29:16.660\n here's what Trump said and here's why it's wrong.\n\n29:16.660 --> 29:20.020\n It's very complicated to figure out\n\n29:20.020 --> 29:21.620\n what is the role of a politician?\n\n29:21.620 --> 29:23.900\n What is the role of a leader in this kind of game\n\n29:23.900 --> 29:25.580\n of politics?\n\n29:25.580 --> 29:29.620\n But certainly in when there's a tragedy,\n\n29:29.620 --> 29:32.060\n when there's a catastrophic event,\n\n29:32.060 --> 29:35.300\n what it takes to be a leader is to see clearly\n\n29:35.300 --> 29:38.760\n through the fog and to make big bold decisions\n\n29:38.760 --> 29:41.180\n that does speak to the truth of things.\n\n29:41.180 --> 29:43.140\n And even if it's unpopular truth,\n\n29:44.300 --> 29:48.100\n to listen to the people, to listen to all sides,\n\n29:48.100 --> 29:51.780\n to the opinions, to the controversial ideas\n\n29:51.780 --> 29:54.660\n and to see past all the bullshit,\n\n29:54.660 --> 29:59.220\n all the political bullshit and just speak to the people,\n\n29:59.220 --> 30:02.700\n speak to the world and make bold, big decisions.\n\n30:02.700 --> 30:04.860\n That's probably what was needed in terms of leadership.\n\n30:04.860 --> 30:09.140\n And I'm not so willing to criticize whether it's Joe Biden\n\n30:09.140 --> 30:11.300\n or Donald Trump on this.\n\n30:11.300 --> 30:15.780\n I think most people cannot be great leaders,\n\n30:15.780 --> 30:18.620\n but that's why when great leaders step up,\n\n30:18.620 --> 30:20.260\n we write books about them.\n\n30:20.260 --> 30:21.220\n And I agree.\n\n30:21.220 --> 30:24.740\n And even though, I mean, I think of myself\n\n30:24.740 --> 30:27.940\n as a progressive person, I certainly was a critic\n\n30:27.940 --> 30:32.940\n of a lot of what President Trump did.\n\n30:33.420 --> 30:36.160\n But on this particular case,\n\n30:36.160 --> 30:39.420\n even though he may have said it in an uncouth way,\n\n30:39.420 --> 30:43.620\n Donald Trump was actually, in my view, right.\n\n30:43.620 --> 30:46.660\n I mean, when he said, hey, let's look at this lab.\n\n30:46.660 --> 30:48.640\n I mean, he said, I have evidence, I can't tell you.\n\n30:48.640 --> 30:51.300\n I don't think he even had the evidence.\n\n30:51.300 --> 30:55.440\n But his intuition that this probably comes from a lab,\n\n30:55.440 --> 30:58.140\n in my view was a correct intuition.\n\n30:58.140 --> 31:00.000\n And certainly I started speaking up\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:04.420\n about pandemic origins early in 2019.\n\n31:04.420 --> 31:08.740\n And my friends, my democratic friends were brutal with me\n\n31:08.740 --> 31:09.740\n saying, what are you doing?\n\n31:09.740 --> 31:11.780\n You're supporting Trump in an election year.\n\n31:11.780 --> 31:15.460\n And I said, just because Donald Trump is saying something\n\n31:15.460 --> 31:17.980\n doesn't mean that I need to oppose it.\n\n31:17.980 --> 31:21.820\n If Donald Trump says something that I think is correct,\n\n31:21.820 --> 31:22.940\n well, I wanna say it's correct,\n\n31:22.940 --> 31:25.260\n just as if he says something that I don't like,\n\n31:25.260 --> 31:26.880\n I'm gonna speak up about that.\n\n31:26.880 --> 31:28.540\n Good, you walked through the fire.\n\n31:28.540 --> 31:31.920\n So that's, you laid out the story here.\n\n31:31.920 --> 31:36.520\n And I think in many ways it's a human story.\n\n31:36.520 --> 31:40.380\n It's a story of politics, it's a story of human nature.\n\n31:40.380 --> 31:45.380\n But let's talk about the story of the virus.\n\n31:45.740 --> 31:48.340\n And let's talk about the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\n31:48.340 --> 31:51.940\n So maybe this is a good time to try to talk about\n\n31:51.940 --> 31:53.540\n its history, about its origins,\n\n31:53.540 --> 31:55.920\n about what kind of stuff it works on,\n\n31:55.920 --> 32:00.780\n about biosafety levels, and about Batwoman.\n\n32:00.780 --> 32:02.820\n Yeah, Xu Zhengli, yes.\n\n32:02.820 --> 32:03.780\n Xu Zhengli.\n\n32:03.780 --> 32:06.540\n So what is the Wuhan Institute of Virology,\n\n32:06.540 --> 32:07.540\n when did it start?\n\n32:07.540 --> 32:09.060\n Yeah, so it's a great question.\n\n32:09.060 --> 32:14.060\n So after SARS 1, which was in the early 2000, 2003, 2004,\n\n32:15.820 --> 32:20.100\n there was this effort to enhance,\n\n32:20.100 --> 32:23.820\n as I mentioned before, global capacity, including in China.\n\n32:23.820 --> 32:25.520\n So the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n32:25.520 --> 32:29.220\n had been around for decades before then.\n\n32:29.220 --> 32:32.100\n But there was an agreement between the French\n\n32:32.100 --> 32:37.100\n and the Chinese governments to build the largest BSL4 lab,\n\n32:37.100 --> 32:39.940\n BSL4 lab, so biosafety level four.\n\n32:39.940 --> 32:42.380\n So in these what are called high containment labs,\n\n32:42.380 --> 32:44.500\n there's level four, which is the highest level.\n\n32:44.500 --> 32:47.340\n And people have seen that on TV and elsewhere,\n\n32:47.340 --> 32:50.780\n where you have the people in the different suits\n\n32:50.780 --> 32:51.900\n and all of these protections.\n\n32:51.900 --> 32:55.520\n And then there's level three, which is still very serious,\n\n32:56.900 --> 32:58.820\n but not as much as level four.\n\n32:58.820 --> 33:03.220\n And then level two is just kind of goggles and some gloves\n\n33:03.220 --> 33:05.700\n and maybe a face mask, much less.\n\n33:05.700 --> 33:10.300\n So the French and the Chinese governments agreed\n\n33:10.300 --> 33:13.500\n that France would help build the first\n\n33:13.500 --> 33:18.500\n and still the largest BSL4 plus some mobile BSL3 labs.\n\n33:20.140 --> 33:22.220\n And they were going to do it in Wuhan.\n\n33:22.220 --> 33:24.980\n And Wuhan is kind of like China's Chicago.\n\n33:24.980 --> 33:26.740\n And I had actually been, it's a different story.\n\n33:26.740 --> 33:30.660\n I'd been in Wuhan relatively not that long\n\n33:30.660 --> 33:32.920\n before the pandemic broke out.\n\n33:32.920 --> 33:34.900\n And that was why I knew that Wuhan,\n\n33:34.900 --> 33:37.380\n it's not some backwater where there are a bunch of yokels\n\n33:37.380 --> 33:40.260\n eating bats for dinner every night.\n\n33:40.260 --> 33:44.260\n This is a really sophisticated, wealthy, highly educated\n\n33:44.260 --> 33:45.840\n and cultured city.\n\n33:45.840 --> 33:48.420\n And so I knew that it wasn't like\n\n33:48.420 --> 33:50.340\n that even the one on seafood market\n\n33:50.340 --> 33:52.820\n wasn't like some of these seafood markets\n\n33:52.820 --> 33:55.060\n that they have in Southern China or in Cambodia,\n\n33:55.060 --> 33:57.140\n where I lived for two years.\n\n33:57.140 --> 33:59.300\n I mean, it was a totally different thing.\n\n33:59.300 --> 34:01.340\n I'm gonna have to talk to you about some of the,\n\n34:01.340 --> 34:02.660\n including the Wuhan market,\n\n34:02.660 --> 34:04.660\n just some of the wild food going on here.\n\n34:04.660 --> 34:06.340\n Because you've traveled that part of the world.\n\n34:06.340 --> 34:07.180\n But let's not get there.\n\n34:07.180 --> 34:08.860\n Let's not get distracted.\n\n34:08.860 --> 34:11.100\n Good, as I was telling you, Lex, before,\n\n34:11.100 --> 34:13.780\n and this is maybe an advertisement,\n\n34:13.780 --> 34:18.020\n is having now listened to a number of your podcasts\n\n34:18.020 --> 34:20.380\n when I'm doing long ultra training runs\n\n34:20.380 --> 34:22.260\n or driving in the mountains.\n\n34:22.260 --> 34:23.660\n Like the really, because in the beginning,\n\n34:23.660 --> 34:26.080\n we have to talk about whatever it is is the topic.\n\n34:26.080 --> 34:28.340\n But the really good stuff happens later.\n\n34:28.340 --> 34:29.180\n So stay tuned. So friends,\n\n34:29.180 --> 34:31.340\n you should listen to the end.\n\n34:31.340 --> 34:34.900\n I have to say, as I was telling you before,\n\n34:34.900 --> 34:37.780\n like when I heard your long podcast with J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lanier\n\n34:37.780 --> 34:41.140\n and he talked about his mother at the very end,\n\n34:41.140 --> 34:42.740\n I mean, just beautiful stuff.\n\n34:42.740 --> 34:45.500\n So I don't know whether I can match beautiful stuff,\n\n34:45.500 --> 34:47.980\n but I'm gonna do my best.\n\n34:47.980 --> 34:49.140\n You're gonna have to find out.\n\n34:49.140 --> 34:50.820\n Exactly, stay tuned.\n\n34:52.700 --> 34:54.900\n So France had this agreement\n\n34:54.900 --> 34:57.900\n that they were going to help design and help build\n\n34:57.900 --> 35:01.060\n this BSL4 lab in Wuhan.\n\n35:01.060 --> 35:04.900\n And it was going to be with French standards,\n\n35:04.900 --> 35:07.540\n and there were going to be 50 French experts\n\n35:07.540 --> 35:09.420\n who were going to work there\n\n35:09.420 --> 35:12.700\n and supervise the work that happened\n\n35:12.700 --> 35:16.060\n even after the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n35:16.060 --> 35:21.060\n in the new location started operating.\n\n35:22.140 --> 35:24.460\n But then when they started building it,\n\n35:24.460 --> 35:28.540\n the French contractors, the French overseers\n\n35:28.540 --> 35:31.500\n were increasingly appalled\n\n35:31.500 --> 35:33.420\n that they had less and less control,\n\n35:33.420 --> 35:37.140\n that the Chinese contractors were swapping out new things,\n\n35:37.140 --> 35:39.620\n it wasn't built up to French standards,\n\n35:39.620 --> 35:44.180\n so much that at the end, when it was finally built,\n\n35:44.180 --> 35:47.860\n the person who was the vice chairman of the project\n\n35:47.860 --> 35:51.380\n and a leading French industrialist named Marieau\n\n35:51.380 --> 35:52.980\n refused to sign off.\n\n35:52.980 --> 35:55.620\n And he said, we can't support,\n\n35:55.620 --> 35:58.220\n we have no idea what this is,\n\n35:58.220 --> 36:00.220\n whether it's safe or not.\n\n36:00.220 --> 36:02.980\n And when this lab opened,\n\n36:02.980 --> 36:05.980\n remember it was supposed to have 50 French experts,\n\n36:05.980 --> 36:07.900\n it had one French expert.\n\n36:07.900 --> 36:11.340\n And so the French were really disgusted.\n\n36:11.340 --> 36:14.740\n And actually when the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n36:14.740 --> 36:19.460\n and its new location opened in 2018, two things happened.\n\n36:19.460 --> 36:22.100\n One, French intelligence privately approached\n\n36:22.100 --> 36:25.100\n US intelligence saying, we have a lot of concerns\n\n36:25.100 --> 36:27.260\n about the Wuhan Institute of Virology,\n\n36:27.260 --> 36:29.220\n about its safety, and we don't even know\n\n36:29.220 --> 36:30.380\n who's operating there,\n\n36:30.380 --> 36:34.020\n is it being used as a dual use facility?\n\n36:34.020 --> 36:38.540\n And also in 2018, the US embassy in Beijing\n\n36:38.540 --> 36:42.220\n sent some people down to Wuhan to go and look at,\n\n36:42.220 --> 36:44.500\n well, at this laboratory.\n\n36:44.500 --> 36:48.500\n And they wrote a scathing cable that Josh Rogin\n\n36:48.500 --> 36:52.540\n from the Washington Post later got his hands on saying,\n\n36:52.540 --> 36:54.140\n this is really unsafe,\n\n36:54.140 --> 36:58.740\n they're doing work on dangerous bat coronaviruses\n\n36:58.740 --> 37:02.700\n in conditions where a leak is possible.\n\n37:02.700 --> 37:05.660\n And so then you mentioned Shujing Li,\n\n37:05.660 --> 37:08.620\n and I'll connect that to these virologists\n\n37:08.620 --> 37:11.100\n who I was talking about.\n\n37:11.100 --> 37:14.220\n So there's a very credible thesis\n\n37:14.220 --> 37:17.780\n that because these pathogenic outbreaks happen\n\n37:17.780 --> 37:19.740\n in other parts of the world,\n\n37:19.740 --> 37:24.660\n having partnerships with experts in those parts of the world\n\n37:24.660 --> 37:28.020\n must be a foundation of our efforts.\n\n37:28.020 --> 37:29.980\n We can't just bring everything home\n\n37:29.980 --> 37:32.940\n because we know that viruses don't care about borders\n\n37:32.940 --> 37:34.980\n and boundaries, and so if something happens there,\n\n37:34.980 --> 37:36.180\n it's going to come here.\n\n37:36.180 --> 37:41.180\n So very correctly, we have all kinds of partnerships\n\n37:41.660 --> 37:43.980\n with experts in these labs,\n\n37:43.980 --> 37:47.260\n and Shujing Li was one of those partners.\n\n37:47.260 --> 37:51.380\n And her closest relationship was with Peter Daszak,\n\n37:51.380 --> 37:53.980\n who's a British, I think now American,\n\n37:53.980 --> 37:57.580\n but the president of a thing called EcoHealth Alliance,\n\n37:57.580 --> 37:59.220\n which was getting money from NIH.\n\n37:59.220 --> 38:01.780\n And basically, EcoHealth Alliance\n\n38:01.780 --> 38:03.420\n was a pass through organization.\n\n38:03.420 --> 38:06.580\n And over the years, it was only about $600,000.\n\n38:06.580 --> 38:07.980\n So almost all of her funding\n\n38:07.980 --> 38:09.260\n came from the Chinese government,\n\n38:09.260 --> 38:11.780\n but there's a little bit that came from the United States.\n\n38:11.780 --> 38:15.140\n And so she became their kind of leading expert\n\n38:15.140 --> 38:17.620\n and the point of contact\n\n38:17.620 --> 38:20.220\n between the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n38:20.220 --> 38:25.220\n and certainly Peter Daszak, but also with others.\n\n38:25.900 --> 38:28.860\n And that was why in the earliest days of the outbreak,\n\n38:28.860 --> 38:30.340\n I didn't mention that,\n\n38:30.340 --> 38:32.860\n I did mention that there were these virologists\n\n38:32.860 --> 38:34.940\n who had this fake certainty\n\n38:34.940 --> 38:36.620\n that they knew it came from nature\n\n38:36.620 --> 38:38.860\n and it didn't come from a lab\n\n38:38.860 --> 38:41.340\n and they called people like me conspiracy theorists\n\n38:41.340 --> 38:43.860\n just for raising that possibility.\n\n38:43.860 --> 38:46.820\n But when Peter Daszak was organizing that effort\n\n38:46.820 --> 38:50.020\n in February of 2020,\n\n38:50.020 --> 38:52.460\n what he said is we need to rally\n\n38:52.460 --> 38:54.100\n behind our Chinese colleagues.\n\n38:54.100 --> 38:55.940\n And the basic idea was\n\n38:56.820 --> 38:59.660\n these international collaborations are under threat.\n\n38:59.660 --> 39:01.300\n And I think it was because of that,\n\n39:01.300 --> 39:06.300\n because Peter Daszak's basically his major contribution\n\n39:06.340 --> 39:09.180\n as a scientist was just tacking his name\n\n39:09.180 --> 39:12.940\n on work that Shujang Li had largely done.\n\n39:12.940 --> 39:14.420\n He was defending a lot,\n\n39:14.420 --> 39:16.820\n certainly for himself and his organization.\n\n39:16.820 --> 39:20.620\n So you think EcoHealth Alliance and Peter\n\n39:20.620 --> 39:21.980\n is less about money,\n\n39:21.980 --> 39:24.740\n it's more about kind of almost like legacy\n\n39:24.740 --> 39:26.660\n because you're so attached to this work?\n\n39:26.660 --> 39:27.860\n Is it just on a human level?\n\n39:27.860 --> 39:29.060\n I think so.\n\n39:29.060 --> 39:31.860\n I mean, I've been criticized for being actually,\n\n39:31.860 --> 39:34.780\n I'm certainly a big critic of Peter Daszak,\n\n39:34.780 --> 39:38.460\n but I've been criticized by some for being too lenient.\n\n39:38.460 --> 39:39.940\n I mean, it's so easy to say,\n\n39:39.940 --> 39:43.140\n oh, somebody they're like an evil ogre\n\n39:43.140 --> 39:45.460\n and just trying to do evil\n\n39:45.460 --> 39:49.700\n and cackling in their closet or whatever.\n\n39:49.700 --> 39:51.140\n But I think for most of us,\n\n39:51.140 --> 39:55.460\n even those of us who do terrible, horrible things,\n\n39:55.460 --> 39:57.620\n the story that we tell ourselves\n\n39:57.620 --> 40:01.060\n and we really believe is that we're doing the thing\n\n40:01.060 --> 40:02.540\n that we most believe in.\n\n40:02.540 --> 40:04.540\n I mean, I did my PhD dissertation\n\n40:04.540 --> 40:06.780\n on the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.\n\n40:06.780 --> 40:09.940\n They genuinely saw themselves as idealists.\n\n40:09.940 --> 40:13.860\n They thought, well, we need to make radical change\n\n40:13.860 --> 40:15.660\n to build a better future.\n\n40:15.660 --> 40:17.740\n And what they described as,\n\n40:17.740 --> 40:19.100\n that they felt was radical change\n\n40:19.100 --> 40:21.900\n was a monstrous atrocities by us.\n\n40:21.900 --> 40:24.100\n So the criticism here of Peter\n\n40:26.980 --> 40:31.820\n is that he was a part of an organization\n\n40:31.820 --> 40:36.460\n that was kind of, well, funding an effort\n\n40:36.460 --> 40:39.020\n that was an unsafe implementation\n\n40:39.020 --> 40:42.060\n of a biosafety level four laboratory.\n\n40:42.060 --> 40:43.340\n Well, a few things.\n\n40:43.340 --> 40:47.980\n So what he thought he was doing was,\n\n40:47.980 --> 40:49.580\n and then what he thought he was doing\n\n40:49.580 --> 40:51.700\n is itself highly controversial\n\n40:51.700 --> 40:56.340\n because there's one there that in 2011,\n\n40:56.340 --> 40:57.860\n there were, I know you've talked about this\n\n40:57.860 --> 41:00.620\n with other guests, but in 2011,\n\n41:00.620 --> 41:04.020\n there were the first published papers\n\n41:04.020 --> 41:07.500\n on this now infamous gain of function research.\n\n41:07.500 --> 41:10.540\n And basically what they did,\n\n41:10.540 --> 41:14.620\n both in different labs and certainly in the United States,\n\n41:14.620 --> 41:18.660\n in Wisconsin and in the Netherlands,\n\n41:18.660 --> 41:21.980\n was they had a bird flu virus\n\n41:21.980 --> 41:26.980\n that was very dangerous, but not massively transmissive.\n\n41:28.540 --> 41:31.620\n And they had a gain of function process\n\n41:31.620 --> 41:33.660\n through what's called serial passage,\n\n41:33.660 --> 41:35.620\n which means basically passing advice,\n\n41:35.620 --> 41:39.260\n like natural selection, but forcing natural selection\n\n41:39.260 --> 41:42.500\n by just passing a virus through different cell cultures\n\n41:42.500 --> 41:46.340\n and then selecting for what it is that you want.\n\n41:46.340 --> 41:49.500\n So relatively easily, they took this deadly,\n\n41:49.500 --> 41:51.900\n but not massively transmissive virus\n\n41:51.900 --> 41:53.940\n and turned it into, in a lab,\n\n41:53.940 --> 41:57.380\n a deadly and transmissive virus.\n\n41:57.380 --> 41:59.580\n And that showed that this is really dangerous.\n\n41:59.580 --> 42:01.220\n And so there were, at that point,\n\n42:01.220 --> 42:03.060\n there was a huge controversy.\n\n42:03.060 --> 42:07.140\n There were some people, like Richard Ebright\n\n42:07.140 --> 42:09.580\n and Mark Lipsitch at Harvard,\n\n42:09.580 --> 42:12.500\n who were saying that this is really dangerous.\n\n42:12.500 --> 42:16.900\n We're in the idea that we need to create monsters\n\n42:16.900 --> 42:17.900\n to study monsters.\n\n42:17.900 --> 42:21.180\n I think maybe even you have said that in the past.\n\n42:21.180 --> 42:22.340\n It doesn't make sense\n\n42:22.340 --> 42:24.660\n because there's an unlimited number of monsters.\n\n42:24.660 --> 42:25.820\n And so what are we gonna do?\n\n42:25.820 --> 42:27.500\n Create an unlimited number of monsters.\n\n42:27.500 --> 42:28.460\n And if we do that,\n\n42:28.460 --> 42:31.460\n eventually the monsters are going to get out.\n\n42:31.460 --> 42:33.660\n Then there was the Peter Daszak camp,\n\n42:33.660 --> 42:35.460\n and he got a lot of funding,\n\n42:35.460 --> 42:37.260\n particularly from the United States,\n\n42:37.260 --> 42:40.340\n who said, well, and certainly Collins and Fauci\n\n42:40.340 --> 42:42.020\n were supportive of this.\n\n42:42.020 --> 42:44.660\n And they thought, well, there's a safe way\n\n42:44.660 --> 42:46.380\n to go out into the world\n\n42:46.380 --> 42:49.620\n to collect the world's most dangerous viruses\n\n42:49.620 --> 42:52.180\n and to poke and prod them\n\n42:52.180 --> 42:54.260\n to figure out how they might mutate,\n\n42:54.260 --> 42:56.420\n how they might become more dangerous\n\n42:56.420 --> 43:01.420\n with the goal of predicting future pandemics.\n\n43:01.580 --> 43:03.660\n And that certainly never happened\n\n43:03.660 --> 43:07.980\n with the goal of creating vaccines and treatments.\n\n43:07.980 --> 43:11.180\n And that largely never happened,\n\n43:11.180 --> 43:14.380\n but that was, so Peter Daszak kind of epitomized\n\n43:14.380 --> 43:18.180\n that second approach.\n\n43:18.180 --> 43:20.980\n And as you've talked about in the past,\n\n43:20.980 --> 43:24.100\n in 2014, there was a funding moratorium\n\n43:24.100 --> 43:27.940\n in the United States, and then in 2017, that was lifted.\n\n43:27.940 --> 43:29.100\n It didn't affect the funding\n\n43:29.100 --> 43:33.380\n that went to the EcoHealth Alliance.\n\n43:33.380 --> 43:37.020\n So when this happened in the beginning,\n\n43:37.020 --> 43:40.060\n and again, coming back to Peter's motivations,\n\n43:40.060 --> 43:44.020\n I don't think, here's the best case scenario for Peter.\n\n43:44.020 --> 43:47.100\n I'm gonna give you what I imagine he was thinking,\n\n43:47.100 --> 43:49.740\n and then I'll tell you what I actually think.\n\n43:49.740 --> 43:51.740\n So I think here's what he's thinking.\n\n43:51.740 --> 43:56.340\n This is most likely a natural origin outbreak.\n\n43:56.340 --> 44:00.420\n Just like SARS one, again, in Peter's hypothetical mind,\n\n44:00.420 --> 44:04.540\n just like SARS one, this is most likely a natural outbreak.\n\n44:04.540 --> 44:06.980\n We need to have an international coalition\n\n44:06.980 --> 44:08.700\n in order to fight it.\n\n44:08.700 --> 44:11.980\n If we allow these political attacks\n\n44:11.980 --> 44:14.180\n to undermine our Chinese counterparts\n\n44:14.180 --> 44:16.220\n and the trust in these relationships\n\n44:16.220 --> 44:18.500\n that we've built over many years,\n\n44:18.500 --> 44:20.660\n we're really screwed because they have\n\n44:20.660 --> 44:23.780\n the most local knowledge of these outbreaks.\n\n44:23.780 --> 44:27.700\n And even though, and this guy gets a lot more complicated,\n\n44:27.700 --> 44:30.700\n even though there are basic questions\n\n44:30.700 --> 44:34.700\n that anybody would ask and that Shujing Li herself did ask\n\n44:34.700 --> 44:37.700\n about the origins of this pandemic,\n\n44:37.700 --> 44:40.900\n even though Peter Daszak, and I'll describe this\n\n44:40.900 --> 44:44.980\n in a moment, had secret information that we didn't have,\n\n44:44.980 --> 44:48.340\n that in my mind massively increases the possibility\n\n44:48.340 --> 44:52.340\n of a lab incident origin, I, Peter Daszak,\n\n44:52.340 --> 44:55.860\n would like to guide the public conversation\n\n44:55.860 --> 44:58.860\n in the direction where I think it should go\n\n44:58.860 --> 45:03.580\n and in support of the kind of international collaboration\n\n45:03.580 --> 45:04.660\n that I think is necessary.\n\n45:04.660 --> 45:06.260\n That's a strong, positive discussion\n\n45:06.260 --> 45:11.260\n because it's true that there's a lot of political BS\n\n45:11.940 --> 45:16.940\n and a lot of kind of just bickering and lies\n\n45:16.940 --> 45:18.940\n as we've talked about.\n\n45:18.940 --> 45:21.100\n And so it's very convenient to say, you know what?\n\n45:21.100 --> 45:24.080\n Let's just ignore all of these quote unquote lies\n\n45:24.080 --> 45:26.220\n and my favorite word, misinformation.\n\n45:27.140 --> 45:31.780\n And then because the way out from this serious pandemic\n\n45:31.780 --> 45:33.420\n is for us to work together.\n\n45:33.420 --> 45:36.260\n So let's strengthen our partnerships\n\n45:36.260 --> 45:38.460\n and everything else is just like noise.\n\n45:38.460 --> 45:41.020\n Yeah, so let's, and so then now I wanna do\n\n45:41.020 --> 45:43.460\n my personal indictment of Peter Daszak\n\n45:43.460 --> 45:46.380\n because that's my view, but I wanted to fairly.\n\n45:46.380 --> 45:47.220\n That's nice.\n\n45:47.220 --> 45:51.700\n Because I think that we all tell ourselves stories\n\n45:51.700 --> 45:56.380\n and also when you're a science communicator,\n\n45:56.380 --> 45:59.220\n you can't in your public communications\n\n45:59.220 --> 46:03.300\n give every doubt that you have or every nuance,\n\n46:03.300 --> 46:05.820\n you kind of have to summarize things.\n\n46:05.820 --> 46:07.580\n And so I think that he was, again,\n\n46:07.580 --> 46:10.780\n in this benign interpretation trying to summarize\n\n46:10.780 --> 46:14.100\n in the way that he thought the conversations should go.\n\n46:14.100 --> 46:16.700\n Here's my indictment of Peter Daszak.\n\n46:16.700 --> 46:20.940\n And I feel like a Brutus here,\n\n46:20.940 --> 46:25.940\n but I have not come here to praise Peter Daszak\n\n46:26.060 --> 46:29.260\n because while Peter Daszak was doing all of this\n\n46:29.260 --> 46:31.660\n and making all of these statements about,\n\n46:31.660 --> 46:34.380\n well, we pretty much know it's a natural origin.\n\n46:34.380 --> 46:38.140\n Then there was this February, 2020 Lancet letter\n\n46:38.140 --> 46:40.940\n where it turns out, and we only knew this later\n\n46:40.940 --> 46:42.820\n that he was highly manipulative.\n\n46:42.820 --> 46:45.260\n So he was recruiting all of these people.\n\n46:45.260 --> 46:48.940\n He drafted the infamous letter calling people like me,\n\n46:48.940 --> 46:50.620\n conspiracy theorists.\n\n46:50.620 --> 46:54.500\n He then wrote to people like Ralph Barak and Linfa Wang,\n\n46:54.500 --> 46:57.180\n who are also very high profile virologists saying,\n\n46:57.180 --> 46:59.060\n well, let's not put our names on it.\n\n46:59.060 --> 47:01.900\n So it doesn't look like we're doing it,\n\n47:01.900 --> 47:04.500\n even though they were doing it.\n\n47:04.500 --> 47:09.380\n He didn't disclose a lot of information that they had.\n\n47:09.380 --> 47:10.820\n It was a strategic move.\n\n47:10.820 --> 47:13.700\n So just in case people are not familiar,\n\n47:13.700 --> 47:18.700\n February, 2020, Lancet letter was TLDR,\n\n47:20.100 --> 47:24.900\n is a lab leak hypothesis, is a conspiracy theory.\n\n47:24.900 --> 47:26.620\n Essentially, yes.\n\n47:26.620 --> 47:29.580\n So like with the authority of science,\n\n47:29.580 --> 47:32.300\n not saying like it's highly likely,\n\n47:32.300 --> 47:37.300\n saying it's obvious, duh, it's natural origin.\n\n47:37.300 --> 47:40.780\n Everybody else is just,\n\n47:40.780 --> 47:42.780\n everything else is just misinformation.\n\n47:42.780 --> 47:44.900\n And look, there's a bunch of really smart people\n\n47:44.900 --> 47:46.380\n that signed this, therefore it's true.\n\n47:46.380 --> 47:49.540\n Yeah, not only that, so there were the people\n\n47:49.540 --> 47:51.700\n who, 27 people signed that letter.\n\n47:51.700 --> 47:54.380\n And then after President Trump cut funding\n\n47:54.380 --> 47:58.980\n to EcoHealth Alliance, then he organized 77 Nobel laureates\n\n47:58.980 --> 48:01.700\n to have a public letter criticizing that.\n\n48:01.700 --> 48:06.420\n But what Peter knew then that we didn't fully know\n\n48:06.420 --> 48:10.980\n is that in March of 2018, EcoHealth Alliance,\n\n48:10.980 --> 48:13.660\n in partnership with the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n48:13.660 --> 48:18.660\n and others, had applied for a $14 million grant to DARPA,\n\n48:19.340 --> 48:23.300\n which is kind of like the VC side of the venture capital\n\n48:23.300 --> 48:25.540\n side of the Defense Department.\n\n48:25.540 --> 48:29.380\n They're kind of, where they do kind of big ideas.\n\n48:29.380 --> 48:31.180\n By the way, as a tiny tangent,\n\n48:31.180 --> 48:33.940\n I've gotten a lot of funding from DARPA.\n\n48:33.940 --> 48:36.340\n They fund a lot of excellent robotics research.\n\n48:36.340 --> 48:37.700\n And DARPA is incredible.\n\n48:37.700 --> 48:39.940\n And among the things that they applied for\n\n48:39.940 --> 48:42.420\n is that we, meaning Wuhan Institute of Virology,\n\n48:42.420 --> 48:44.980\n is gonna go and it's gonna collect\n\n48:44.980 --> 48:49.420\n the most dangerous bat coronaviruses in Southern China.\n\n48:49.420 --> 48:52.340\n And then we, as this group,\n\n48:52.340 --> 48:56.620\n are going to genetically engineer these viruses\n\n48:56.620 --> 48:59.780\n to insert a furin cleavage site.\n\n48:59.780 --> 49:02.620\n So I think when everyone's now seen the image\n\n49:02.620 --> 49:06.320\n of the SARS CoV2 virus, it has these little spike proteins,\n\n49:06.320 --> 49:07.940\n these little things that stick out,\n\n49:07.940 --> 49:09.900\n which is why they call it a coronavirus.\n\n49:09.900 --> 49:12.400\n Within that spike protein are these furin cleavage sites,\n\n49:12.400 --> 49:14.840\n which basically help with the virus\n\n49:14.840 --> 49:18.060\n getting access into our cells.\n\n49:18.060 --> 49:20.140\n And they were going to genetically engineer\n\n49:20.140 --> 49:24.180\n these furin cleavage sites into these bat coronaviruses,\n\n49:24.180 --> 49:26.380\n the serbicoviruses.\n\n49:26.380 --> 49:30.700\n And then, and so then a year and a half later,\n\n49:30.700 --> 49:31.720\n what do we see?\n\n49:31.720 --> 49:36.720\n We see a bat coronavirus with a furin cleavage site\n\n49:36.740 --> 49:39.840\n unlike anything that we've ever seen before\n\n49:39.840 --> 49:44.200\n in that category of SARS like coronaviruses.\n\n49:44.200 --> 49:49.060\n That, well, yes, I mean, the DARPA very correctly\n\n49:49.060 --> 49:50.900\n didn't support that application.\n\n49:50.900 --> 49:53.140\n Well, let's actually, let's like pause on that.\n\n49:53.140 --> 49:56.100\n So for a lot of people, that's like the smoking gun.\n\n49:56.100 --> 50:01.100\n Okay, let's talk about this 2018 proposal to DARPA.\n\n50:02.240 --> 50:04.180\n So I guess who's drafted the proposal?\n\n50:04.180 --> 50:09.180\n Is it EcoHealth, but the proposal is to do research.\n\n50:09.260 --> 50:14.260\n EcoHealth is technically a US funded organization.\n\n50:14.660 --> 50:15.500\n Primarily.\n\n50:15.500 --> 50:18.500\n And then the idea was to do work\n\n50:18.500 --> 50:20.860\n at Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\n50:20.860 --> 50:22.340\n With, yeah, so it was.\n\n50:22.340 --> 50:23.160\n With EcoHealth.\n\n50:23.160 --> 50:26.980\n Yes, so EcoHealth, basically the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n50:26.980 --> 50:29.900\n was gonna go and they were gonna collect these viruses\n\n50:29.900 --> 50:31.860\n and store them at Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\n50:31.860 --> 50:33.660\n But they're also gonna do the actual task.\n\n50:33.660 --> 50:35.500\n According, it's a really important point.\n\n50:35.500 --> 50:38.580\n According to their proposal, the actual work\n\n50:38.580 --> 50:41.780\n was going to be done at the lab of Ralph Barak\n\n50:41.780 --> 50:43.420\n at the University of North Carolina,\n\n50:43.420 --> 50:47.860\n who's probably the world's leading expert on coronaviruses.\n\n50:47.860 --> 50:52.860\n And so we know that DARPA didn't fund that work.\n\n50:54.080 --> 50:59.080\n We know, I think quite well that Ralph Barak's lab,\n\n50:59.080 --> 51:04.080\n in part because it was not funded by DARPA,\n\n51:04.080 --> 51:06.200\n they didn't do that specific work.\n\n51:06.200 --> 51:10.200\n What we don't know is, well, what work was done\n\n51:10.200 --> 51:12.400\n at the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n51:12.400 --> 51:15.600\n because WIV was part of this proposal.\n\n51:15.600 --> 51:18.280\n They had access to all of the plans.\n\n51:18.280 --> 51:21.000\n They had done, they had their own capacity\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:23.520\n and they had already done a lot of work\n\n51:23.520 --> 51:28.520\n in genetically altering this exact category of viruses.\n\n51:28.760 --> 51:33.240\n They had created chimeric mixed viruses.\n\n51:33.240 --> 51:37.680\n They had mastered pretty much all of the steps\n\n51:37.680 --> 51:39.920\n in order to achieve this thing that they applied\n\n51:39.920 --> 51:42.720\n for funding with EcoHealth to do.\n\n51:42.720 --> 51:47.720\n And so the question is, did the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n51:47.720 --> 51:50.320\n go through with that research anyway?\n\n51:50.320 --> 51:53.760\n And in my mind, that's a very, very real possibility.\n\n51:53.760 --> 51:54.600\n It would certainly explain\n\n51:54.600 --> 51:57.000\n why they're giving no information.\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.920\n And as you know, I've been a member\n\n51:59.920 --> 52:02.520\n of the World Health Organization Expert Advisory Committee\n\n52:02.520 --> 52:06.000\n on Human Genome Editing, which Dr. Tedros created\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:07.720\n in the aftermath of the announcement\n\n52:07.720 --> 52:10.160\n of the world's first CRISPR babies.\n\n52:10.160 --> 52:11.760\n And it was just basically the first time\n\n52:11.760 --> 52:14.320\n and it was just basically the exact same story.\n\n52:14.320 --> 52:16.720\n So Ho Chiang Kui, a Chinese scientist,\n\n52:16.720 --> 52:18.160\n it was not a first tier scientist,\n\n52:18.160 --> 52:21.240\n but a perfectly adequate second tier scientist,\n\n52:21.240 --> 52:23.840\n came to the United States, learned all of these capacities,\n\n52:23.840 --> 52:25.180\n went back to China and said,\n\n52:25.180 --> 52:28.160\n well, there's a much more permissive environment.\n\n52:28.160 --> 52:30.560\n I'm gonna be a world leader.\n\n52:30.560 --> 52:33.280\n I'm gonna establish both myself and China.\n\n52:33.280 --> 52:37.280\n So in every scientific field, we're seeing this same thing\n\n52:37.280 --> 52:41.540\n where you kind of learn a model and then you do it in China.\n\n52:41.540 --> 52:45.640\n So is it possible that the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n52:45.640 --> 52:49.920\n with this exact game plan was doing it anyway?\n\n52:49.920 --> 52:51.800\n Do we, possible?\n\n52:51.800 --> 52:55.080\n We have no clue what work was being done\n\n52:55.080 --> 52:56.880\n at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\n52:56.880 --> 52:59.840\n It seems extremely likely\n\n52:59.840 --> 53:02.080\n that at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,\n\n53:02.080 --> 53:04.520\n and this is certainly the US government position,\n\n53:04.520 --> 53:08.320\n there was the work that was being done in Dr. Hsu's lab,\n\n53:08.320 --> 53:10.320\n but that wasn't the whole WIV.\n\n53:10.320 --> 53:12.600\n We know, at least according to the United States government,\n\n53:12.600 --> 53:14.180\n that there was the Chinese military,\n\n53:14.180 --> 53:17.560\n that PLA was doing work there.\n\n53:17.560 --> 53:22.140\n Were they doing this kind of work, not to create a bioweapon,\n\n53:22.140 --> 53:25.120\n but in order to understand these viruses,\n\n53:25.120 --> 53:28.280\n maybe to develop vaccines and treatments?\n\n53:28.280 --> 53:33.160\n It seems like a very, very logical possibility.\n\n53:33.160 --> 53:36.280\n And then, so we know that the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n53:36.280 --> 53:37.600\n had all of the skills.\n\n53:37.600 --> 53:40.640\n We know that they were part of this proposal.\n\n53:40.640 --> 53:43.760\n And then you have Peter Daszak, who knows all of this,\n\n53:43.760 --> 53:47.360\n that at that time, in February of 2020, we didn't know.\n\n53:47.360 --> 53:49.560\n But then he comes swinging out of the gate,\n\n53:49.560 --> 53:52.600\n saying anybody who's raising this possibility\n\n53:52.600 --> 53:57.000\n of a lab incident origin is a conspiracy theorist.\n\n53:57.000 --> 54:00.480\n I mean, it really makes him look, in my mind,\n\n54:00.480 --> 54:01.400\n very, very bad.\n\n54:01.400 --> 54:04.480\n And yet, not to at least be somewhat open minded on this,\n\n54:04.480 --> 54:06.080\n because he knows all the details.\n\n54:06.080 --> 54:08.960\n He knows that it's not 0%.\n\n54:08.960 --> 54:12.040\n I mean, there's no way in his mind could you even argue that.\n\n54:12.040 --> 54:14.160\n So it's potential because of the bias,\n\n54:14.160 --> 54:16.120\n because of your focus.\n\n54:16.120 --> 54:20.240\n I mean, it could be the Anthony Fauci masks thing,\n\n54:20.240 --> 54:23.280\n whereas he knows there's some significant probability\n\n54:23.280 --> 54:24.200\n that this is happening.\n\n54:24.200 --> 54:28.680\n But in order to preserve good relations\n\n54:28.680 --> 54:30.120\n with our Chinese colleagues,\n\n54:30.120 --> 54:33.000\n we want to make sure we tell a certain kind of narrative.\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:34.720\n So it's not really lying.\n\n54:34.720 --> 54:39.200\n It's doing the best possible action at this time\n\n54:39.200 --> 54:40.400\n to help the world.\n\n54:40.400 --> 54:42.160\n Not that this already happened.\n\n54:42.160 --> 54:43.760\n But that's how like...\n\n54:43.760 --> 54:47.480\n I think it's quite likely that that was the story\n\n54:47.480 --> 54:49.440\n that he was telling himself.\n\n54:49.440 --> 54:54.440\n But it's that lack of transparency, in my mind,\n\n54:55.280 --> 54:59.320\n is fraudulent, that we were struggling\n\n54:59.320 --> 55:02.520\n to understand something that we didn't understand.\n\n55:02.520 --> 55:05.280\n And that I just think that people who possess\n\n55:05.280 --> 55:10.040\n that kind of information, especially when the existence,\n\n55:10.040 --> 55:12.280\n like the entire career of Peter Daszak\n\n55:12.280 --> 55:14.320\n is based on US taxpayers,\n\n55:14.320 --> 55:16.760\n there's a debt that comes with that.\n\n55:16.760 --> 55:19.040\n And that debt is honesty and transparency.\n\n55:19.040 --> 55:21.000\n And for all of us, and you talked about\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:22.880\n your girlfriend checking your phone.\n\n55:22.880 --> 55:26.280\n For all of us, being honest and transparent\n\n55:26.280 --> 55:29.240\n in the most difficult times is really difficult.\n\n55:29.240 --> 55:31.360\n If it were easy, everybody would do it.\n\n55:31.360 --> 55:36.360\n And I just feel that Peter was the opposite of transparent\n\n55:37.400 --> 55:39.800\n and then went on the offensive.\n\n55:39.800 --> 55:44.400\n And then had the gall of joining,\n\n55:44.400 --> 55:46.080\n I know we can talk about this,\n\n55:46.080 --> 55:51.080\n this highly compromised joint study process\n\n55:51.560 --> 55:54.360\n with the international experts\n\n55:54.360 --> 55:56.640\n and their Chinese government counterparts.\n\n55:56.640 --> 55:59.960\n And used that as a way of furthering\n\n55:59.960 --> 56:04.960\n this, in my mind, fraudulent narrative\n\n56:05.040 --> 56:09.040\n that it almost certainly came from natural origins\n\n56:09.040 --> 56:12.760\n and a lab origin was extremely unlikely.\n\n56:12.760 --> 56:15.920\n Just to stick briefly on the proposal to wrap that up,\n\n56:15.920 --> 56:20.920\n because I do think, in a kind of John Stewart way,\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:25.440\n if you heard that a bit yet,\n\n56:25.440 --> 56:30.440\n sort of kind of like common sense way,\n\n56:30.480 --> 56:35.400\n the 2018 proposal to DARPA from EcoHealth Alliance\n\n56:35.400 --> 56:38.240\n and Wuhan Institute of Virology,\n\n56:38.240 --> 56:41.800\n just seems like a bit of a smoking gun to me, like that.\n\n56:43.680 --> 56:46.800\n So there's this excellent book that people should read\n\n56:46.800 --> 56:50.280\n called Viral, The Search for the Origin of COVID 19.\n\n56:50.280 --> 56:54.480\n Matt Ridley and Alena Chan, I think Alena is in MIT.\n\n56:54.480 --> 56:55.760\n Probably. At the Broad, yeah.\n\n56:55.760 --> 56:57.800\n At Broad Institute, yeah, yeah.\n\n56:57.800 --> 57:00.840\n So she, I heard her in an interview\n\n57:00.840 --> 57:04.040\n give this analogy of unicorns.\n\n57:04.040 --> 57:09.040\n And where basically somebody writes a proposal\n\n57:09.200 --> 57:14.200\n to add horns to horses, the proposal is rejected.\n\n57:14.520 --> 57:17.800\n And then a couple of years later or a year later,\n\n57:17.800 --> 57:19.040\n a unicorn shows up.\n\n57:19.920 --> 57:23.240\n In the place where they're proposing to do it.\n\n57:23.240 --> 57:24.080\n I mean, that's so, I had.\n\n57:24.080 --> 57:26.800\n And then everyone's like, it's natural origin.\n\n57:26.800 --> 57:29.000\n It's like, it's possible it's natural origin.\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:31.000\n Like we haven't detected a unicorn yet.\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:33.720\n And this is the first time we've detected a unicorn.\n\n57:33.720 --> 57:36.800\n Or it could be this massive organization\n\n57:36.800 --> 57:39.520\n that was planning, is fully equipped,\n\n57:39.520 --> 57:42.840\n has like a history of being able to do this stuff,\n\n57:42.840 --> 57:45.120\n has the world experts to do it, has the funding,\n\n57:45.120 --> 57:48.600\n has the motivation to add horns to horses.\n\n57:48.600 --> 57:52.160\n And now a unicorn shows up and they're saying, nope.\n\n57:52.160 --> 57:54.360\n Definitely natural.\n\n57:54.360 --> 57:56.800\n That connects to your first question\n\n57:56.800 --> 57:59.160\n of how do I get to my 85%?\n\n57:59.160 --> 58:03.080\n And here's a summary of that answer.\n\n58:03.080 --> 58:06.280\n And so it's what I said in my 60 Minutes interview\n\n58:06.280 --> 58:07.960\n a long time ago, of all the gin joints\n\n58:07.960 --> 58:09.240\n and all the towns and all the world,\n\n58:09.240 --> 58:11.800\n the quote from Casablanca.\n\n58:11.800 --> 58:14.600\n And so of all the places in the world\n\n58:14.600 --> 58:19.600\n where we have an outbreak of a SARS like bat coronavirus,\n\n58:19.600 --> 58:23.320\n it's not in the area of the natural habitat\n\n58:23.320 --> 58:25.400\n of the horseshoe bats.\n\n58:25.400 --> 58:28.920\n It's the one city in China\n\n58:28.920 --> 58:33.080\n with the first and largest level four virology lab,\n\n58:33.080 --> 58:34.680\n which actually wasn't even using it.\n\n58:34.680 --> 58:38.160\n They were doing level three and level two for this work,\n\n58:38.160 --> 58:39.840\n where they had the world's largest collection\n\n58:39.840 --> 58:41.960\n of bat coronaviruses,\n\n58:41.960 --> 58:45.200\n where they were doing aggressive experiments\n\n58:45.200 --> 58:49.760\n designed to make these scary viruses scarier,\n\n58:49.760 --> 58:52.960\n where they had been part of an application\n\n58:52.960 --> 58:56.040\n to insert a furin cleavage site,\n\n58:56.040 --> 58:59.920\n able to infect human cells.\n\n58:59.920 --> 59:02.960\n And when the outbreak happened,\n\n59:02.960 --> 59:07.120\n we had a virus that was ready for action to infect humans.\n\n59:07.120 --> 59:09.800\n And to this day, better able to infect humans\n\n59:09.800 --> 59:13.440\n than any other species, including bats.\n\n59:13.440 --> 59:17.400\n And then from day one, there's this massive coverup.\n\n59:17.400 --> 59:19.080\n And then on top of that,\n\n59:19.080 --> 59:21.880\n in spite of lots of efforts by lots of people,\n\n59:21.880 --> 59:24.680\n there's basically no evidence\n\n59:24.680 --> 59:27.280\n for the natural origin hypothesis.\n\n59:27.280 --> 59:29.920\n Everything that I've described just now is circumstantial,\n\n59:29.920 --> 59:31.760\n but there's a certain point\n\n59:31.760 --> 59:34.240\n where you add up the circumstances\n\n59:34.240 --> 59:37.520\n and you see this seems pretty, pretty likely.\n\n59:37.520 --> 59:39.560\n I mean, if we're getting to 100%,\n\n59:39.560 --> 59:42.160\n we are not at 100% by any means.\n\n59:42.160 --> 59:45.320\n There still is a possibility of a natural origin.\n\n59:45.320 --> 59:46.840\n And if we find that, great.\n\n59:46.840 --> 59:48.920\n But from everything that I know,\n\n59:48.920 --> 59:50.600\n that's how I get to my 85.\n\n59:50.600 --> 59:53.960\n And we'll talk about why this matters\n\n59:53.960 --> 59:56.320\n in the political sense, in the human sense,\n\n59:56.320 --> 59:59.040\n in the science, in the realm of science,\n\n59:59.040 --> 1:00:00.120\n all of those factors.\n\n1:00:00.120 --> 1:00:04.040\n But first, as Nietzsche said, let us look into the abyss\n\n1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:06.040\n and the games we'll play with monsters.\n\n1:00:06.040 --> 1:00:12.240\n That is colloquially called gain of function research.\n\n1:00:12.240 --> 1:00:14.680\n Let me ask the kind of political sounding question,\n\n1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:16.840\n which is how people usually phrase it.\n\n1:00:16.840 --> 1:00:24.120\n Did Anthony Fauci fund gain of function research\n\n1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:26.800\n at the Wuhan Institute of Virology?\n\n1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:27.800\n So it depends.\n\n1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:31.560\n I mean, I've obviously been very closely monitoring this.\n\n1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:32.800\n I've spoken a lot about it.\n\n1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:34.680\n I've written about it.\n\n1:00:34.680 --> 1:00:37.800\n And it depends on, I mean, not to quote Bill Clinton,\n\n1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:39.920\n but to quote Bill Clinton, it depends on what\n\n1:00:39.920 --> 1:00:41.800\n the definition of is is.\n\n1:00:41.800 --> 1:00:46.640\n And so if you use a common sense definition of gain of function,\n\n1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:48.680\n and by gain of function, there are lots of things\n\n1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:50.640\n like gene therapies that are gain of function.\n\n1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:52.680\n But here, what we mean is gain of function\n\n1:00:52.680 --> 1:01:00.280\n for pathogens potentially able to create human pandemics.\n\n1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:04.040\n But if you use the kind of common sense language,\n\n1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:05.640\n well, then he probably did.\n\n1:01:05.640 --> 1:01:10.680\n If you use the technical language from a 2017 NIH\n\n1:01:10.680 --> 1:01:14.880\n document, and you read that language very narrowly,\n\n1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:19.400\n I think you can make a credible argument that he did not.\n\n1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:22.800\n There's a question, though, and Francis Collins\n\n1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:25.640\n talked about that in his interview with you.\n\n1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:28.760\n But then there's a question that we know from now\n\n1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:31.760\n that we have the information of the reports submitted\n\n1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:36.320\n by EcoHealth Alliance to the NIH, and some of which\n\n1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:40.440\n were late or not even delivered, that some of this research\n\n1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:45.920\n was done on MERS, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus.\n\n1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:49.160\n And if that was the case, there is, I think,\n\n1:01:49.160 --> 1:01:53.640\n a colorable argument that that would be considered\n\n1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:58.040\n gain of function research even by the narrow language\n\n1:01:58.040 --> 1:01:59.360\n of that 2017 document.\n\n1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:02.960\n But I definitely think, and I've said this repeatedly,\n\n1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:08.080\n that Rand Paul can be right, and Tony Fauci can be right.\n\n1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:12.120\n And the question is, how are we defining gain of function?\n\n1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:14.480\n And that's why I've always said the question in my mind\n\n1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:17.680\n isn't, was it or wasn't it gain of function,\n\n1:02:17.680 --> 1:02:22.280\n as if that's like a binary thing, if not, grade,\n\n1:02:22.280 --> 1:02:23.960\n and if yes, guilty.\n\n1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:27.200\n The question is just, what work was being done at the Wuhan\n\n1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:28.760\n Institute of Virology?\n\n1:02:28.760 --> 1:02:33.480\n What role, if any, did US government funding\n\n1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:36.920\n play in supporting that work?\n\n1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:41.320\n And what rights do we all have as human beings\n\n1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:43.680\n and as American citizens and taxpayers\n\n1:02:43.680 --> 1:02:47.120\n to get all of the relevant information about that?\n\n1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:51.200\n So let's try to kind of dissect this.\n\n1:02:51.200 --> 1:02:55.160\n So who frustrates you more, Rand Paul or Anthony\n\n1:02:55.160 --> 1:02:57.720\n Fauci in his discussion or the discussion itself?\n\n1:02:57.720 --> 1:03:00.760\n So for example, gain of function is\n\n1:03:00.760 --> 1:03:06.600\n a term that's kind of more used just\n\n1:03:06.600 --> 1:03:11.640\n to mean playing with viruses in the lab\n\n1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:16.240\n to try to develop more dangerous viruses.\n\n1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:22.200\n Is this kind of research a good idea?\n\n1:03:22.200 --> 1:03:26.840\n Is it also a good idea for us to talk about it in public,\n\n1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:29.920\n in the political way that it's been talked about?\n\n1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:38.000\n Is it OK that US may have funded gain of function research\n\n1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:39.040\n elsewhere?\n\n1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:43.600\n I mean, it's kind of assumed, just like with Bill Clinton,\n\n1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:46.760\n there was very little discussion of, I think,\n\n1:03:46.760 --> 1:03:49.680\n correct me if I'm wrong, but whether it's\n\n1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:54.120\n OK for a president, male or female,\n\n1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:58.760\n to have extramarital sex or is it\n\n1:03:58.760 --> 1:04:04.000\n OK for a president to have extramarital sex\n\n1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:08.920\n with people on his staff or her staff?\n\n1:04:08.920 --> 1:04:12.320\n It was more the discussion of lying, I think.\n\n1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:16.240\n It was, did you lie about having sex or not?\n\n1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:18.360\n And in this gain of function discussion,\n\n1:04:18.360 --> 1:04:21.240\n what frustrates me personally is there's not\n\n1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:23.720\n a deep philosophical discussion about whether we\n\n1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:25.760\n should be doing this kind of research\n\n1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:32.360\n and what are the ethical lines, research on animals at all.\n\n1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:33.640\n Those are fascinating questions.\n\n1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:36.480\n Instead, it's a gotcha thing.\n\n1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:40.440\n Did you or did you not fund research on gain of function?\n\n1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:43.720\n And did you fund, it's almost like a bioweapon.\n\n1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:47.920\n Did you give money to China to develop this bioweapon that\n\n1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:49.760\n now attacked the rest of the world?\n\n1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:52.800\n So I mean, all those things are pretty frustrating,\n\n1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:56.000\n but is there, I think, the thing you\n\n1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:59.160\n can untangle about Anthony Fauci and gain of function\n\n1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:01.720\n research in the United States and the EcoHealth Alliance\n\n1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:07.440\n and Wuhan Institute of Virology that's clarifying.\n\n1:05:07.440 --> 1:05:08.800\n What were the mistakes made?\n\n1:05:08.800 --> 1:05:09.280\n Sure.\n\n1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:11.600\n So on gain of function, there actually\n\n1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:14.360\n has been a lot of debate.\n\n1:05:14.360 --> 1:05:18.000\n I mentioned before in 2011, these first papers,\n\n1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:20.120\n there was a big debate.\n\n1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:22.640\n Mark Lipsitch, who's formerly at Harvard now\n\n1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:26.960\n with the US government working in the president's office,\n\n1:05:26.960 --> 1:05:29.840\n he led a thing called the Cambridge Group that\n\n1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:32.600\n was highly critical of this work,\n\n1:05:32.600 --> 1:05:35.720\n basically saying we're creating monsters.\n\n1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:39.200\n They had the funding pause in 2014.\n\n1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:42.720\n They spent three years putting together a framework,\n\n1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:45.280\n and then they lifted it in 2017.\n\n1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:47.200\n So we had a thoughtful conversation.\n\n1:05:47.200 --> 1:05:48.760\n Unfortunately, it didn't work.\n\n1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:50.880\n And I think that's where we are now.\n\n1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:54.880\n So I absolutely think that there are real issues\n\n1:05:54.880 --> 1:05:58.600\n with the relationship between the United States government\n\n1:05:58.600 --> 1:06:01.600\n and EcoHealth Alliance, and through that,\n\n1:06:01.600 --> 1:06:05.280\n the EcoHealth Alliance with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\n1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:08.240\n And one issue is just essential transparency,\n\n1:06:08.240 --> 1:06:10.960\n because as I see it, it's most likely the case\n\n1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:14.440\n that we transferred a lot of our knowledge and plans and things\n\n1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:16.640\n to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\n1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:22.120\n And again, I'm sure that Xiaojiang Li is not herself\n\n1:06:22.120 --> 1:06:23.000\n a monster.\n\n1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:26.160\n I'm sure of that, even though I've never met her.\n\n1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:29.080\n But there are just a different set of pressures\n\n1:06:29.080 --> 1:06:31.360\n on people working in an authoritarian system\n\n1:06:31.360 --> 1:06:33.360\n than people who are working in other systems.\n\n1:06:33.360 --> 1:06:36.480\n That doesn't mean it's entirely different.\n\n1:06:36.480 --> 1:06:40.640\n And so I absolutely think that we shouldn't give $1\n\n1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:44.000\n to an organization, and certainly a virology institute,\n\n1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:47.800\n where you don't have full access to their records,\n\n1:06:47.800 --> 1:06:49.000\n to their databases.\n\n1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:52.480\n We don't know what work is happening there.\n\n1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:57.360\n And I think that we need to have that kind of full examination.\n\n1:06:57.360 --> 1:07:01.440\n So I understand what Dr. Fauci is doing is saying,\n\n1:07:01.440 --> 1:07:03.120\n hey, what I hear Dr. Fauci saying,\n\n1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:05.160\n what I hear from you, Rand Paul, is\n\n1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:08.760\n you're accusing me of starting this pandemic.\n\n1:07:08.760 --> 1:07:11.400\n And you're using gain of function as a proxy for that.\n\n1:07:11.400 --> 1:07:13.320\n And we have, when there are Senate hearings,\n\n1:07:13.320 --> 1:07:15.280\n every senator gets five minutes.\n\n1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:18.520\n And the name of the game is to translate your five minutes\n\n1:07:18.520 --> 1:07:22.080\n into a clip that's going to run on the news.\n\n1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:25.920\n And so I get that there is that kind of gotcha.\n\n1:07:25.920 --> 1:07:31.720\n But I also think that Dr. Fauci and the National\n\n1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:35.160\n Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the NIH\n\n1:07:35.160 --> 1:07:37.080\n should have been more transparent.\n\n1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:41.160\n Because I think that in this day and age, where\n\n1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:42.880\n there are a lot of people poking around\n\n1:07:42.880 --> 1:07:45.320\n and this whole story of COVID origins,\n\n1:07:45.320 --> 1:07:47.720\n we would not be where we are if it\n\n1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:51.080\n wasn't for a relatively small number of people.\n\n1:07:51.080 --> 1:07:54.720\n And I'm part of, there are two, as I know, two groups.\n\n1:07:54.720 --> 1:07:57.960\n One is these internet sleuths known as Drastic.\n\n1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:00.520\n And a number of them are part of a group\n\n1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:03.160\n that I'm part of called, it's not our official name,\n\n1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:04.280\n but called the Paris Group.\n\n1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:08.400\n It's about two dozen experts around the world,\n\n1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:13.320\n but centered around some very high level French academics.\n\n1:08:13.320 --> 1:08:16.600\n So we've all been digging and meeting with each other\n\n1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:19.520\n regularly since last year.\n\n1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:22.200\n And our governments across the board, certainly China,\n\n1:08:22.200 --> 1:08:23.880\n but including the United States, haven't\n\n1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:27.320\n been as transparent as they need to be.\n\n1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:31.400\n So definitely mistakes were made on all sides.\n\n1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:33.640\n And that's why for me from day one,\n\n1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:37.040\n I've been calling for a comprehensive investigation\n\n1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:40.760\n into this issue that certainly obviously looks at China,\n\n1:08:40.760 --> 1:08:41.880\n but we have to look at ourselves.\n\n1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:43.440\n We did not get this right.\n\n1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:48.440\n So do you, I'm just gonna put Rand Paul aside here.\n\n1:08:50.400 --> 1:08:53.280\n Politician playing political games, it's very frustrating,\n\n1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:56.400\n but it is what it is on all sides.\n\n1:08:56.400 --> 1:08:59.960\n Anthony Fauci, you think should have been more transparent\n\n1:08:59.960 --> 1:09:04.960\n and maybe more eloquent in expressing the complexity\n\n1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.760\n of all of this, the uncertainty in all of this.\n\n1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:16.520\n Yeah, and I get that it's really hard to do that\n\n1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:21.160\n because let's say you have one, you speak a paragraph\n\n1:09:21.160 --> 1:09:23.120\n and it's got four sentences.\n\n1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:25.720\n And one of those sentences is the thing\n\n1:09:25.720 --> 1:09:27.080\n that's going to be turned into Twitter.\n\n1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:28.280\n All right, let me put it back.\n\n1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:32.480\n I get really, so I'll try not to be emotional about this,\n\n1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:37.480\n but I've heard Anthony Fauci a couple of times now\n\n1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:41.760\n say that he represents science.\n\n1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:45.560\n I know what he means by that.\n\n1:09:45.560 --> 1:09:48.920\n He means in this political bickering,\n\n1:09:48.920 --> 1:09:52.120\n all that kind of stuff that for a lot of people,\n\n1:09:52.120 --> 1:09:56.440\n he represents science, but words matter.\n\n1:09:56.440 --> 1:09:58.600\n And this isn't just clips.\n\n1:09:58.600 --> 1:10:00.400\n I mean, maybe I'm distinctly aware of that\n\n1:10:00.400 --> 1:10:01.880\n doing this podcast.\n\n1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:05.120\n Yeah, I talked for hundreds of hours now,\n\n1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:07.200\n maybe over a thousand hours,\n\n1:10:07.200 --> 1:10:11.520\n but I'm still careful with the words.\n\n1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:13.160\n I'm trying not to be an asshole\n\n1:10:13.160 --> 1:10:14.840\n and I'm aware when I'm an asshole\n\n1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:16.240\n and I'll apologize for it.\n\n1:10:17.640 --> 1:10:21.360\n If the words I represent science left my mouth,\n\n1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:22.720\n which they very well could,\n\n1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:26.040\n I would sure as hell be apologizing for it\n\n1:10:26.040 --> 1:10:29.120\n and not because I got in trouble,\n\n1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:31.480\n I would just feel bad about saying something like that.\n\n1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:34.640\n And even that little phrase, I represent science.\n\n1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:39.120\n No, Dr. Fauci, you do not represent science.\n\n1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:42.480\n I love science, the millions of scientists\n\n1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:45.160\n that inspired me to get into it.\n\n1:10:45.160 --> 1:10:48.080\n To fall in love with the scientific method\n\n1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:53.080\n in the exploration of ideas through the rigor of science,\n\n1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:55.520\n that Anthony Fauci does not represent.\n\n1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:59.880\n He's one, I believe, great scientist of millions.\n\n1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:02.600\n He does not represent anybody.\n\n1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:04.080\n He's just one scientist.\n\n1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:07.160\n And I think the greatness of a scientist\n\n1:11:07.160 --> 1:11:10.320\n is best exemplified in humility\n\n1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:13.960\n because the scientific method basically says,\n\n1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:18.960\n you're standing before the fog, the mystery of it all,\n\n1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:22.640\n and slowly chipping away at the mystery.\n\n1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:27.000\n And it's embarrassing, it's humiliating\n\n1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.360\n how little you know, that's the experience.\n\n1:11:29.360 --> 1:11:33.000\n So the great scientists have to have humility to me.\n\n1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:34.880\n And especially in their communication,\n\n1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:36.200\n they have to have humility.\n\n1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:37.600\n And I mean, I don't know,\n\n1:11:37.600 --> 1:11:39.560\n and some of it is also words matter\n\n1:11:39.560 --> 1:11:44.560\n because great leaders have to have the poetry of action.\n\n1:11:45.640 --> 1:11:49.640\n They have to be bold and inspire action\n\n1:11:49.640 --> 1:11:52.720\n across millions of people.\n\n1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:57.720\n But you also have to, through that poetry of words,\n\n1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:02.800\n express the complexity of the uncertainty\n\n1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:04.280\n you're operating under.\n\n1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:06.680\n Be humble in the face of not being able\n\n1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:09.640\n to predict the future or understand the past,\n\n1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:11.600\n or really know what's the right thing to do,\n\n1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:13.320\n but we have to do something.\n\n1:12:13.320 --> 1:12:16.680\n And through that, you have to be a great leader\n\n1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:17.960\n that inspires action.\n\n1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:20.120\n And some of that is just words.\n\n1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:22.000\n And he chose words poorly.\n\n1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:25.440\n I mean, so I'm all torn about this.\n\n1:12:25.440 --> 1:12:28.200\n And then there's politicians, they're taking those words\n\n1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:31.680\n and magnifying them and playing games with them.\n\n1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:34.360\n And of course, that's a disincentive\n\n1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:37.760\n for the people who do, the scientific leaders\n\n1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:41.640\n that step into the limelight to say any more words.\n\n1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:43.520\n So they kind of become more conservative\n\n1:12:43.520 --> 1:12:45.360\n with the words they use.\n\n1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:47.080\n I mean, it just becomes a giant mess.\n\n1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:52.080\n But I think the solution is to ignore all of that\n\n1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:56.800\n and to be transparent, to be honest, to be vulnerable.\n\n1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:01.600\n And to express the full uncertainty\n\n1:13:01.600 --> 1:13:03.600\n of what you're operating under,\n\n1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:05.880\n to present all the possible actions\n\n1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:08.360\n and to be honest about the mistakes they made in the past.\n\n1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:10.340\n I mean, there's something, even if you're not\n\n1:13:10.340 --> 1:13:13.000\n directly responsible for those mistakes,\n\n1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:18.000\n taking responsibility for them is a way to win people over.\n\n1:13:18.020 --> 1:13:20.360\n I don't think leaders realize this often\n\n1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:23.200\n in the modern age, in the internet age.\n\n1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:24.920\n They can see through your bullshit.\n\n1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:29.160\n And it's really inspiring when you take ownership.\n\n1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:32.680\n So to do the thought experiment in public,\n\n1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:35.320\n do a thought experiment if there was a lab leak\n\n1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:38.960\n and then lay out all the funding, the EcoHealth Alliance,\n\n1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:43.600\n all the incredible science going on at the Wuhan Institute\n\n1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:45.380\n of Virology and the NIH.\n\n1:13:46.380 --> 1:13:48.480\n Lay out all the possible ethical problems.\n\n1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:53.480\n Lay out all the possible mistakes that could have been made\n\n1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:56.160\n and say like, this could have happened.\n\n1:13:56.160 --> 1:13:59.520\n And if this happened, here's the best way to respond to it\n\n1:13:59.520 --> 1:14:00.880\n and to prevent it in the future.\n\n1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:02.880\n And just lay all that complexity out.\n\n1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:06.040\n I wish we would have seen that.\n\n1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:09.400\n And I have hope that this conversation,\n\n1:14:09.400 --> 1:14:11.800\n conversations like it, your work,\n\n1:14:11.800 --> 1:14:15.840\n and books on this topic will inspire young people today\n\n1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:18.600\n when they become in the Anthony Fauci's role\n\n1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:22.200\n to be much more transparent and much more humble\n\n1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:23.620\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:14:23.620 --> 1:14:26.120\n That this is just a relic of the past\n\n1:14:26.120 --> 1:14:28.000\n when there's a person, no offense to me,\n\n1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.240\n in a suit that has to stand up and speak\n\n1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:33.000\n with clarity and certainty.\n\n1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:34.720\n I mean, that's just a relic of the past.\n\n1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:39.360\n Is my hope.\n\n1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:40.200\n But...\n\n1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:41.040\n Do you mind if I...\n\n1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:41.880\n Yeah, please.\n\n1:14:41.880 --> 1:14:46.200\n I agree with a great deal of what you said.\n\n1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:49.760\n And it's really unfortunate that our,\n\n1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:51.840\n certainly the Chinese government, as I said before,\n\n1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:55.540\n our government wasn't as transparent\n\n1:14:55.540 --> 1:14:56.920\n as I feel they should have been,\n\n1:14:56.920 --> 1:14:59.600\n particularly in the early days of the pandemic\n\n1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:02.000\n and particularly with regard to the issue\n\n1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.400\n of pandemic origins.\n\n1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:06.760\n I mean, we know that Dr. Fauci was on calls\n\n1:15:06.760 --> 1:15:10.680\n with people like Christian Anderson and Scripps and others\n\n1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:13.440\n in those early days, raising questions.\n\n1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:15.680\n Is this an engineered virus?\n\n1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:17.480\n There were a lot of questions.\n\n1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:19.560\n And it's kind of sad.\n\n1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:23.520\n I mean, as I mentioned before, I've been one,\n\n1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:25.640\n I mean, and certainly there were others,\n\n1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:27.740\n but there weren't a lot of us,\n\n1:15:27.740 --> 1:15:30.800\n of the people who from the earliest days of the pandemic\n\n1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:34.960\n were raising questions about, hey, not so fast here.\n\n1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:38.560\n And I launched my website on pandemic origins\n\n1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:41.160\n in April of last year, April, 2020.\n\n1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:42.580\n It got a huge amount of attention.\n\n1:15:42.580 --> 1:15:44.960\n And actually my friend, Matt Pottinger,\n\n1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:46.880\n who is the deputy national security advisor,\n\n1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:50.440\n when he was reaching out to people in the US government\n\n1:15:50.440 --> 1:15:51.840\n and in allied government saying,\n\n1:15:51.840 --> 1:15:54.360\n hey, we should look into this,\n\n1:15:54.360 --> 1:15:56.760\n what he was sending them was my website.\n\n1:15:56.760 --> 1:16:00.240\n It wasn't some US government information.\n\n1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:02.720\n And by the way, people should still go to the website.\n\n1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:07.360\n You keep updating it and it's an incredible resource.\n\n1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:09.360\n Thank you, thank you, jamiemetzel.com.\n\n1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:13.440\n And it's really unfortunate that our governments\n\n1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:18.320\n and international institutions for pretty much all of 2020\n\n1:16:18.320 --> 1:16:22.520\n weren't doing their jobs of really probing this issue.\n\n1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:26.520\n People were hiding behind this kind of false consensus.\n\n1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:28.480\n And I'm critical of many people,\n\n1:16:28.480 --> 1:16:32.440\n even when I heard Francis Collins interview with you,\n\n1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:35.280\n I just felt, well, he wasn't as balanced\n\n1:16:35.280 --> 1:16:37.400\n on the issue of COVID origins.\n\n1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:41.480\n Certainly Dr. Fauci could have in his conversation\n\n1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:43.380\n with Rand Paul, it wasn't even a conversation,\n\n1:16:43.380 --> 1:16:46.600\n but in some process in the aftermath,\n\n1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:48.280\n could have laid things out a bit better.\n\n1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:50.880\n He did say, and Francis Collins did say\n\n1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:53.360\n that we don't know the origins and that was a shift\n\n1:16:54.320 --> 1:16:56.120\n and we need to have an investigation.\n\n1:16:56.120 --> 1:17:00.600\n So now, but having said all of that,\n\n1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:04.940\n I do kind of one, I have tremendous respect for Dr. Fauci\n\n1:17:04.940 --> 1:17:06.880\n for the work that he's done on HIV AIDS.\n\n1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:10.920\n I mean, I have been vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine.\n\n1:17:10.920 --> 1:17:14.000\n Dr. Fauci was a big part of the story\n\n1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:15.640\n of getting us these vaccines\n\n1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:19.440\n that have saved millions and millions of lives.\n\n1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:23.200\n And so I don't think, I mean, there's a lot to this story.\n\n1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:26.480\n And then the second thing is it's really hard\n\n1:17:26.480 --> 1:17:28.440\n to be a public health expert\n\n1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:32.120\n because you have your mission is public health.\n\n1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:35.100\n And so, and you have to, if you are leading\n\n1:17:35.100 --> 1:17:37.800\n with all of your uncertainty,\n\n1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:40.480\n it's a really hard way to do things.\n\n1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:43.680\n And so like, even now, like if I go to CVS\n\n1:17:43.680 --> 1:17:47.960\n and I get a Tylenol, somebody has done a calculation\n\n1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:51.520\n of how many people will die from taking Tylenol\n\n1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:54.040\n and they say, well, all right, we can live with that.\n\n1:17:54.040 --> 1:17:55.960\n And that's why we have regulation.\n\n1:17:55.960 --> 1:17:59.120\n And so all of us are doing kind of summaries.\n\n1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:00.920\n And then we have people in public health who are saying,\n\n1:18:00.920 --> 1:18:04.880\n wow, we've summed it all up and you should do X.\n\n1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:09.480\n You should get your kids vaccinated for measles.\n\n1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:12.920\n You should not drive your car at a hundred miles an hour.\n\n1:18:12.920 --> 1:18:15.240\n You should, don't drink lighter fluid,\n\n1:18:15.240 --> 1:18:17.360\n whatever these things are.\n\n1:18:17.360 --> 1:18:20.960\n And we want them to kind of give us broad guidelines.\n\n1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:25.200\n And yet now our information world is so fragmented\n\n1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:29.760\n that if you're not being honest about something,\n\n1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:33.220\n something material, someone's going to find out\n\n1:18:33.220 --> 1:18:35.000\n and it's going to undermine your credibility.\n\n1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:40.000\n And so I agree with you that there's a greater requirement\n\n1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:43.400\n for transparency now.\n\n1:18:43.400 --> 1:18:44.480\n Maybe there always has been,\n\n1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:48.520\n but there's an even greater requirement for it now\n\n1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:53.520\n because people want to trust that you're speaking honestly\n\n1:18:53.640 --> 1:18:56.040\n and that you're saying, well, here's what I know.\n\n1:18:56.040 --> 1:18:58.080\n And this is based on what I know,\n\n1:18:58.080 --> 1:19:00.520\n here are the conclusions that I draw.\n\n1:19:00.520 --> 1:19:03.440\n But if it's just, and again, I don't think the words,\n\n1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:06.920\n I'm science or whatever it was are the right words.\n\n1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:10.840\n But if it's just, trust me because of who I am,\n\n1:19:10.840 --> 1:19:13.540\n I don't think that flies anywhere anymore.\n\n1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:18.040\n Can I just ask you about the Francis Collins interview\n\n1:19:18.040 --> 1:19:20.000\n that I did, if you got a chance to hear that part.\n\n1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:22.600\n I think in the beginning we talk about the lab leak.\n\n1:19:23.720 --> 1:19:25.880\n What are your thoughts about his response,\n\n1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:28.800\n basically saying it's worthy of an investigation,\n\n1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:33.480\n but I mean, I don't know how you would interpret it.\n\n1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:38.480\n I see, it's funny because I heard it in the moment\n\n1:19:39.640 --> 1:19:44.360\n as it's great for the head of NIH\n\n1:19:44.360 --> 1:19:46.800\n to be open minded on this.\n\n1:19:46.800 --> 1:19:51.040\n But then the internet and Mr. Joe Rogan\n\n1:19:51.040 --> 1:19:55.040\n and a bunch of friends and colleagues told me that,\n\n1:19:55.040 --> 1:19:58.640\n yeah, well, that's too late and too little.\n\n1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:03.240\n Yeah, so first let me say, I've been on Joe's podcast twice\n\n1:20:03.240 --> 1:20:06.380\n and I love the guy, which doesn't mean that I agree\n\n1:20:06.380 --> 1:20:09.300\n with everything he does or says.\n\n1:20:10.200 --> 1:20:13.800\n And on this issue, and I'm normally a pretty calm\n\n1:20:13.800 --> 1:20:17.160\n and measured guy, and when you're just out running\n\n1:20:17.160 --> 1:20:21.120\n with your AirPods on and you start yelling\n\n1:20:21.120 --> 1:20:23.960\n into the wind in Central Park,\n\n1:20:23.960 --> 1:20:27.600\n nobody else knows why you're yelling, but well.\n\n1:20:27.600 --> 1:20:28.960\n So that you had such a moment?\n\n1:20:28.960 --> 1:20:30.600\n I had a moment with Collins.\n\n1:20:30.600 --> 1:20:34.040\n And again, Francis Collins is someone I respect enormously.\n\n1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:38.480\n I mean, I live a big chunk of my life living in the world\n\n1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:42.480\n of genetics and biotech and my book, Hacking Darwin\n\n1:20:42.480 --> 1:20:45.160\n is about the future of human genetic engineering\n\n1:20:45.160 --> 1:20:47.200\n and his work on the Human Genome Project\n\n1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:49.240\n and so many other things have been fantastic.\n\n1:20:49.240 --> 1:20:53.320\n And I'm a huge fan of the work of NIH.\n\n1:20:53.320 --> 1:20:56.080\n And he was right to say that the Chinese government\n\n1:20:56.080 --> 1:20:58.720\n hasn't been forthcoming and we need to look into it.\n\n1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:01.920\n But then you asked him, well, how will we know?\n\n1:21:01.920 --> 1:21:03.700\n And then his answer was,\n\n1:21:03.700 --> 1:21:06.120\n we need to find the intermediate host.\n\n1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:09.240\n Remember I said before, and so that made it clear\n\n1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:13.080\n that he thought, well, we should have an investigation,\n\n1:21:13.080 --> 1:21:16.480\n but it comes from nature and we just need to find\n\n1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:20.240\n that whatever it is, that intermediate animal host\n\n1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:22.480\n in the wild, and that'll tell us the story.\n\n1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:25.640\n So he already had the conclusion in mind\n\n1:21:25.640 --> 1:21:27.320\n and they're just waiting for the evidence\n\n1:21:27.320 --> 1:21:28.400\n to support the conclusion.\n\n1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:29.680\n That was my feeling.\n\n1:21:29.680 --> 1:21:33.200\n I felt like he was open in general, but he was tilting.\n\n1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:36.480\n And again, your first question was where do I fall?\n\n1:21:36.480 --> 1:21:41.480\n He was like, I'm 85% or whatever it is, 80, 75, 90,\n\n1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:45.000\n whatever it is in the direction of a lab incident.\n\n1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:49.720\n It made it feel that he was 90, 10 in the other direction,\n\n1:21:49.720 --> 1:21:52.320\n which is still means that he's open minded\n\n1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:54.000\n about the possibility.\n\n1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:58.000\n And that's why, in my view, every single person\n\n1:21:58.000 --> 1:21:59.520\n who talks about this issue,\n\n1:21:59.520 --> 1:22:02.560\n I think the right answer in my view is,\n\n1:22:02.560 --> 1:22:04.080\n we don't know conclusively.\n\n1:22:04.080 --> 1:22:06.040\n In my, then this is my personal view,\n\n1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:08.760\n the circumstantial evidence is strongly in favor\n\n1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:10.120\n of a lab incident origin,\n\n1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:11.760\n but that could immediately shift\n\n1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:13.920\n with additional information.\n\n1:22:13.920 --> 1:22:18.760\n We need transparency, but we should come together\n\n1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:23.400\n in absolutely condemning the outrageous coverup\n\n1:22:23.400 --> 1:22:25.360\n carried out by the Chinese government,\n\n1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:30.360\n which to this day is preventing any meaningful investigation\n\n1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:31.760\n into pandemic origins.\n\n1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:35.400\n We have, if you use the economist numbers,\n\n1:22:35.400 --> 1:22:39.920\n 15 million people who are dead as a result of this pandemic.\n\n1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:43.600\n And I believe that the actions of the Chinese government\n\n1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:49.600\n are disgracing the memory of these 15 million dead.\n\n1:22:50.160 --> 1:22:54.840\n They're insulting the families and the billions of people\n\n1:22:54.840 --> 1:22:56.480\n around the world who have suffered\n\n1:22:56.480 --> 1:23:00.000\n from this totally avoidable pandemic.\n\n1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:03.800\n And whatever the origin, the fact the criminal coverup\n\n1:23:03.800 --> 1:23:06.480\n carried out by the Chinese government,\n\n1:23:06.480 --> 1:23:09.080\n which continues to this day, but most intensely\n\n1:23:09.080 --> 1:23:11.640\n in the first months following the outbreak,\n\n1:23:11.640 --> 1:23:16.320\n that's the reason why we have so many dead.\n\n1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:18.640\n And certainly, as I was saying before,\n\n1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:22.480\n I and a small number of others have been carrying this flame\n\n1:23:22.480 --> 1:23:26.560\n since early last year, but it's kind of crazy\n\n1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:29.320\n that our governments haven't been demanding it.\n\n1:23:29.320 --> 1:23:33.080\n And we can talk about the World Health Organization process,\n\n1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:35.560\n which was deeply compromised in the beginning.\n\n1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:38.440\n Now it's become much, much better.\n\n1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:42.520\n But again, it was the pressure of outsiders\n\n1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:44.960\n that played such an important role in shifting\n\n1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:48.840\n our national and international institutions.\n\n1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:50.400\n And while that's better than nothing,\n\n1:23:50.400 --> 1:23:53.320\n it would have been far better if our governments\n\n1:23:53.320 --> 1:23:55.000\n and international organizations\n\n1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:56.400\n had done the right thing from the start.\n\n1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:01.400\n If I could just make a couple of comments about Joe Rogan.\n\n1:24:04.920 --> 1:24:08.600\n So there's a bunch of people in my life\n\n1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:11.720\n who have inspired me, who have taught me a lot,\n\n1:24:11.720 --> 1:24:16.720\n who I even look up to, many of them are alive,\n\n1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:19.000\n most of them are dead.\n\n1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:22.640\n I wanna say that Joe said a few critical words\n\n1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:24.680\n about the conversation with Francis Collins,\n\n1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:28.720\n most of it offline, with a lot of great conversations\n\n1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:32.680\n about it, some he said publicly.\n\n1:24:32.680 --> 1:24:37.680\n And he was also critical to say that me asking hard questions\n\n1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:47.360\n in an interview is not my strong suit.\n\n1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:53.240\n And I really want to kind of respond to that,\n\n1:24:53.240 --> 1:24:56.720\n which I did privately as well, but publicly,\n\n1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:01.280\n to say that Joe is 100% right on that.\n\n1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:04.560\n But that doesn't mean that always has to be the case.\n\n1:25:04.560 --> 1:25:06.680\n And that is definitely something I wanna work on.\n\n1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:08.760\n Because most of the conversations I have,\n\n1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:12.280\n I wanna see the beautiful ideas in people's minds.\n\n1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:15.920\n But there's some times where you have to ask\n\n1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:19.680\n the hard questions to bring out the beautiful ideas.\n\n1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:23.000\n And it's hard to do.\n\n1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:24.040\n It's a skill.\n\n1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:26.480\n And Joe is very good at this.\n\n1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:29.880\n He says the way he put it in his criticisms,\n\n1:25:29.880 --> 1:25:31.640\n and he does this in his conversations,\n\n1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:34.760\n which is, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.\n\n1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:36.520\n There's a kind of sense like,\n\n1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:38.640\n did you just say what you said?\n\n1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:42.520\n Let's make sure we get to the bottom,\n\n1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:44.320\n we'll clarify what you mean.\n\n1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:49.320\n Because sometimes really big negative or difficult ideas\n\n1:25:54.840 --> 1:25:59.080\n can be said as a quick aside in a sentence,\n\n1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:02.720\n like it's nothing, but it could be everything.\n\n1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:04.600\n And you wanna make sure you catch that\n\n1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:06.360\n and you talk about it.\n\n1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:10.760\n And not as a gotcha, not as a kinda way\n\n1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:12.400\n to destroy another human being,\n\n1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:14.840\n but to reveal something profound.\n\n1:26:14.840 --> 1:26:16.960\n And that's definitely something I wanna work on.\n\n1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:21.960\n I also want to say that, as you said,\n\n1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:24.480\n you disagree with Joe on quite a lot of things.\n\n1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:26.480\n So for a long time, Joe was somebody\n\n1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:28.080\n that I was just a fan of and listened to.\n\n1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:30.920\n He's now a good friend.\n\n1:26:30.920 --> 1:26:34.560\n And I would say we disagree more than we agree.\n\n1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:36.520\n And I love doing that.\n\n1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:41.680\n But at the same time, I learned from that.\n\n1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:46.560\n So it's like dual, like nobody in this world\n\n1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:48.720\n can tell me what to think.\n\n1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:53.720\n But I think everybody has a lesson to teach me.\n\n1:26:54.240 --> 1:26:57.080\n I think that's a good way to approach it.\n\n1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:00.320\n Whenever somebody has words of criticism,\n\n1:27:00.320 --> 1:27:04.320\n I assume they're right and walk around with that idea\n\n1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:07.360\n to really sort of empathize with that idea\n\n1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:09.120\n because there's a lesson there.\n\n1:27:09.120 --> 1:27:14.120\n And oftentimes, my understanding of a topic\n\n1:27:18.400 --> 1:27:22.480\n is altered completely or it becomes much more nuanced\n\n1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:27.160\n or much richer for that kind of empathetic process.\n\n1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:31.440\n But definitely, I do not allow anybody\n\n1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:35.040\n to tell me what to think, whether it's Joe Rogan\n\n1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:39.120\n or Fyodor Dostoevsky or Nietzsche or my parents\n\n1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:44.120\n or the proverbial girlfriend, which I don't actually have.\n\n1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:49.880\n But she's still busting my balls.\n\n1:27:49.880 --> 1:27:51.280\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:54.120\n In my imagination, I have a girlfriend in Canada\n\n1:27:55.000 --> 1:28:00.000\n that I have imagined, exactly, imagining conversations.\n\n1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:01.440\n So I want to mention that.\n\n1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:04.000\n But also, I don't know if you've gotten a chance\n\n1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.360\n to see this, but I'd love to also mention\n\n1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:11.360\n this Twitter feud between two other interesting people,\n\n1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:15.800\n which is Brett Weinstein and Sam Harris\n\n1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:18.480\n or Sam Harris and others in general.\n\n1:28:18.480 --> 1:28:22.120\n And it kind of breaks my heart that these two people\n\n1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:25.560\n I listen to that are very thoughtful about a bunch of issues.\n\n1:28:25.560 --> 1:28:29.160\n Let's put COVID aside because people are very emotional\n\n1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:30.520\n about this topic.\n\n1:28:30.520 --> 1:28:35.520\n I mean, I think they're deeply thoughtful and intelligent,\n\n1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:39.040\n whether you agree with them or not.\n\n1:28:39.040 --> 1:28:42.080\n And I always learn something from their conversations.\n\n1:28:42.080 --> 1:28:44.480\n And they are legitimately or have been\n\n1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:46.560\n for a long time friends.\n\n1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:49.400\n And it's a little bit heartbreaking to me\n\n1:28:49.400 --> 1:28:53.320\n to see that they basically don't talk in private anymore.\n\n1:28:53.320 --> 1:28:57.080\n And there's occasional jabs on Twitter.\n\n1:28:57.080 --> 1:29:00.080\n And I hope that changes.\n\n1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:02.240\n I hope that changes in general for COVID,\n\n1:29:02.240 --> 1:29:06.120\n that COVID brought out the, I would say,\n\n1:29:06.120 --> 1:29:10.080\n the most emotional sides of people, the worst in people.\n\n1:29:10.080 --> 1:29:14.280\n And I think there hasn't been enough love\n\n1:29:14.280 --> 1:29:16.600\n and empathy and compassion.\n\n1:29:16.600 --> 1:29:20.720\n And to see two people from whom I've learned a lot,\n\n1:29:20.720 --> 1:29:23.720\n whether it's Eric Weinstein, Brett Weinstein, Sam Harris,\n\n1:29:23.720 --> 1:29:25.520\n you can criticize them as much as you want,\n\n1:29:25.520 --> 1:29:27.360\n their ideas as much as you want.\n\n1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:30.240\n But if you're not sufficiently open minded\n\n1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:33.080\n to admit that you have a lot to learn\n\n1:29:33.080 --> 1:29:37.720\n from their conversations, I think you're not being honest.\n\n1:29:37.720 --> 1:29:40.520\n And so I do hope they have those conversations.\n\n1:29:40.520 --> 1:29:42.040\n And I hope we can kind of,\n\n1:29:42.040 --> 1:29:44.920\n I think there's a lot of repairing to be done post COVID\n\n1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:49.600\n of relationships, of conversations.\n\n1:29:49.600 --> 1:29:53.880\n And I think empathy and love can help a lot there.\n\n1:29:53.880 --> 1:29:58.480\n This is also just a, I talked to Sam privately,\n\n1:29:58.480 --> 1:30:01.040\n but this is also a public call out\n\n1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:06.040\n to put a little bit more love in the world.\n\n1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:13.000\n And for these difficult conversations to happen.\n\n1:30:14.160 --> 1:30:19.160\n Because Brett Weinstein could be very wrong\n\n1:30:19.160 --> 1:30:24.160\n about a bunch of topics here around COVID,\n\n1:30:25.480 --> 1:30:27.440\n but he could also be right.\n\n1:30:27.440 --> 1:30:29.080\n And the only way to find out\n\n1:30:29.080 --> 1:30:31.200\n is to have those conversations.\n\n1:30:31.200 --> 1:30:32.760\n Because there's a lot of people listening\n\n1:30:32.760 --> 1:30:35.480\n to both Sam Harris and Brett Weinstein.\n\n1:30:35.480 --> 1:30:39.520\n And if you go into these silos\n\n1:30:39.520 --> 1:30:42.120\n where you just keep telling each other\n\n1:30:44.960 --> 1:30:46.680\n that you are the possessors of truth\n\n1:30:46.680 --> 1:30:48.800\n and nobody else is the possessor of truth,\n\n1:30:48.800 --> 1:30:53.520\n what starts happening is you both lose track\n\n1:30:53.520 --> 1:30:56.080\n or the capability of arriving at the truth.\n\n1:30:56.080 --> 1:30:58.440\n Because nobody's in the possession of the truth.\n\n1:30:58.440 --> 1:30:59.920\n So anyway, this is just a call out\n\n1:30:59.920 --> 1:31:01.560\n that we should have a little bit more conversation,\n\n1:31:01.560 --> 1:31:02.400\n a little bit more love.\n\n1:31:02.400 --> 1:31:04.240\n I totally agree.\n\n1:31:04.240 --> 1:31:08.000\n And both of those guys are guys who I respect.\n\n1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:11.560\n And as you know, Brett, and again, as I mentioned,\n\n1:31:11.560 --> 1:31:13.760\n they're just a handful of us,\n\n1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:16.320\n who were the early people raising questions\n\n1:31:16.320 --> 1:31:17.640\n about the origins of this.\n\n1:31:17.640 --> 1:31:19.520\n Of this pandemic, right.\n\n1:31:19.520 --> 1:31:21.160\n He was there also talking.\n\n1:31:21.160 --> 1:31:24.000\n So people have heard him speak quite a bit\n\n1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:26.920\n about any viral drugs and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:31:26.920 --> 1:31:30.600\n But he was also raising concerns about lab leak early on.\n\n1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:31.440\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:31:31.440 --> 1:31:33.680\n And so, but I completely agree with you\n\n1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:37.440\n that we don't have to agree with everybody,\n\n1:31:37.440 --> 1:31:40.720\n but it's great to have healthy conversations.\n\n1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:42.120\n That's how we grow.\n\n1:31:42.120 --> 1:31:46.680\n And absolutely, we live in a world where we're kind of,\n\n1:31:46.680 --> 1:31:47.680\n if we're not careful,\n\n1:31:47.680 --> 1:31:49.840\n pushed into these little information pockets.\n\n1:31:49.840 --> 1:31:51.720\n And certainly on social media,\n\n1:31:51.720 --> 1:31:53.960\n I have different parts of my life.\n\n1:31:53.960 --> 1:31:58.560\n One is focusing on issues of COVID origins.\n\n1:31:58.560 --> 1:32:00.920\n And then I have genetics and biotechnology.\n\n1:32:00.920 --> 1:32:02.960\n And then I have, which maybe we'll talk about later,\n\n1:32:02.960 --> 1:32:04.200\n one shared world, which is about\n\n1:32:04.200 --> 1:32:06.680\n how do we build a safer future?\n\n1:32:06.680 --> 1:32:10.320\n And when I say critical things like the Chinese government,\n\n1:32:10.320 --> 1:32:12.880\n we'd have to demand a full investigation\n\n1:32:12.880 --> 1:32:14.120\n into pandemic origins.\n\n1:32:14.120 --> 1:32:15.080\n This is an outreach.\n\n1:32:15.080 --> 1:32:16.640\n Then it's really popular.\n\n1:32:16.640 --> 1:32:19.000\n When I say, let's build a better future\n\n1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:20.520\n for everyone in peace and love,\n\n1:32:20.520 --> 1:32:22.920\n it's like, wow, three people liked it.\n\n1:32:22.920 --> 1:32:24.960\n And one was my mother.\n\n1:32:24.960 --> 1:32:27.960\n And so I just feel like we need to build,\n\n1:32:27.960 --> 1:32:32.000\n we used to have that connectivity just built in\n\n1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:33.960\n because we had these town squares\n\n1:32:33.960 --> 1:32:35.960\n and you couldn't get away from them.\n\n1:32:35.960 --> 1:32:37.640\n Now we can get away from them.\n\n1:32:37.640 --> 1:32:41.120\n So engaging with people who are of a different background\n\n1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:42.400\n is really essential.\n\n1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:47.400\n I'm on Fox News sometimes three, four times a week.\n\n1:32:47.960 --> 1:32:49.640\n And I wouldn't, in my normal life,\n\n1:32:49.640 --> 1:32:53.440\n I'm not watching that much of Fox News\n\n1:32:53.440 --> 1:32:56.120\n or even television more generally.\n\n1:32:56.120 --> 1:32:58.840\n But I just feel like if I just speak to people\n\n1:32:58.840 --> 1:33:03.000\n who are very similar to me, maybe it'll be comfortable.\n\n1:33:03.840 --> 1:33:05.640\n But what have I contributed?\n\n1:33:05.640 --> 1:33:07.600\n So I think we really have to have\n\n1:33:07.600 --> 1:33:11.640\n those kinds of conversations and recognize\n\n1:33:11.640 --> 1:33:15.800\n that at the end of the day, most people want to be happy.\n\n1:33:15.800 --> 1:33:17.280\n They want to live in a better world.\n\n1:33:17.280 --> 1:33:20.160\n They maybe have different paths to get there.\n\n1:33:20.160 --> 1:33:22.600\n But if we just break into camps\n\n1:33:22.600 --> 1:33:24.680\n that don't even connect with each other,\n\n1:33:24.680 --> 1:33:26.520\n that's a much more dangerous world.\n\n1:33:28.920 --> 1:33:31.440\n Let's dive back into the difficult pool.\n\n1:33:32.680 --> 1:33:36.800\n Just like you said, in the English speaking world,\n\n1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:41.800\n it seems popular, almost easy to demonize China.\n\n1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:45.720\n The Chinese government, I should say.\n\n1:33:46.920 --> 1:33:50.160\n But even China, like there's this kind of gray area\n\n1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:52.320\n that people just fall into.\n\n1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:54.920\n And I'm really uncomfortable with that.\n\n1:33:54.920 --> 1:33:58.480\n Perhaps because in my mind, in my heart, in my blood\n\n1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:01.120\n are echoes of the Cold War and that kind of tension.\n\n1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:06.120\n But it feels like we almost desire conflict.\n\n1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:12.040\n So we see demons when there is none.\n\n1:34:12.040 --> 1:34:15.680\n So I'm a little cautious to demonize.\n\n1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:18.120\n But at the same time, you have to be honest.\n\n1:34:18.120 --> 1:34:22.320\n So it's like honest with the demons that are there\n\n1:34:22.320 --> 1:34:23.760\n and honest when they're not.\n\n1:34:25.360 --> 1:34:29.280\n This is kind of a geopolitical therapy session of sorts.\n\n1:34:29.280 --> 1:34:31.760\n So let's keep talking about China\n\n1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:33.000\n a little bit from different angles.\n\n1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:37.840\n So let's return to the director of the Center\n\n1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:39.240\n of Emerging Infectious Disease\n\n1:34:39.240 --> 1:34:42.400\n at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Xi Zhengli,\n\n1:34:44.120 --> 1:34:46.000\n colloquially referred to as Batwoman.\n\n1:34:47.520 --> 1:34:51.440\n So do you think she's lying?\n\n1:34:51.440 --> 1:34:52.280\n Yes.\n\n1:34:52.280 --> 1:34:54.720\n Do you think she's being forced to lie?\n\n1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:55.560\n Yes.\n\n1:34:55.560 --> 1:34:58.240\n I've known a bunch of virologists\n\n1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:00.200\n in private and public conversation\n\n1:35:00.200 --> 1:35:03.520\n that respect her as a human being, as a scientist.\n\n1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:05.080\n I respect her as a human being.\n\n1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:07.080\n Sorry, as a scientist, not a human being.\n\n1:35:07.080 --> 1:35:08.640\n Because I think they don't know the human.\n\n1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:09.520\n They know the scientists.\n\n1:35:09.520 --> 1:35:11.360\n And they respect her a lot as a scientist.\n\n1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:12.720\n Yeah, I respect her.\n\n1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:13.960\n I've never met her.\n\n1:35:13.960 --> 1:35:16.160\n We had one exchange, which I'll mention in a second\n\n1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:17.640\n in a virtual forum.\n\n1:35:17.640 --> 1:35:18.800\n But I do respect her.\n\n1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:20.560\n I actually think that she is somebody\n\n1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:23.120\n who has tried to do the right thing.\n\n1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:25.240\n She was one of the heroes of tracking down\n\n1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:27.440\n the origins of SARS 1.\n\n1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:29.920\n And that was a major contribution.\n\n1:35:31.160 --> 1:35:34.120\n But as we talked about earlier,\n\n1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:38.520\n it's a different thing living, being a scientist,\n\n1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:40.640\n or really kind of anything.\n\n1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:43.960\n It's different being one of those people\n\n1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:47.240\n in an authoritarian society\n\n1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:50.520\n than it is being in a different type of society.\n\n1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:54.200\n And so when Xi Zhengli said that the reason\n\n1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:59.200\n the WIV database was taken offline in September 19\n\n1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:02.280\n was because of computer hacks,\n\n1:36:02.280 --> 1:36:03.960\n I don't think that's the story.\n\n1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:07.560\n I don't think she thinks that's the story.\n\n1:36:07.560 --> 1:36:12.560\n When I asked her in March of 2021, March of this year,\n\n1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:15.480\n in a Rutgers online forum,\n\n1:36:15.480 --> 1:36:18.280\n when I asked her whether the Chinese military\n\n1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:22.200\n had any engagement with the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:26.480\n in any way, and she said, absolutely not, paraphrasing,\n\n1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:27.720\n I think she was lying.\n\n1:36:27.720 --> 1:36:30.720\n Do I think that she had the ability to say,\n\n1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:34.440\n well, either one, yes, but I can't talk about it,\n\n1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:36.560\n or I know there are a lot of things\n\n1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:38.160\n that are happening at this institute\n\n1:36:38.160 --> 1:36:42.080\n that I don't know about, and that could be one.\n\n1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:46.440\n Could she have said that the personnel\n\n1:36:46.440 --> 1:36:48.160\n at the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:52.880\n have all had to go through classification training\n\n1:36:52.880 --> 1:36:57.600\n so that they can know about what can and can't be said?\n\n1:36:57.600 --> 1:36:59.520\n Like she could have said all those things,\n\n1:36:59.520 --> 1:37:01.920\n but she couldn't say all of those things.\n\n1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:06.920\n And I think that's why so many, at least in my view,\n\n1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:11.080\n so many people certainly in the Western world\n\n1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:13.600\n got this story wrong from the beginning,\n\n1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:17.640\n because if your only prism was the science,\n\n1:37:17.640 --> 1:37:20.680\n and you just assumed this is a science question\n\n1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:22.680\n to be left to the scientists,\n\n1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:26.000\n should Zhengli is just like any scientist\n\n1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:29.280\n working in Switzerland or Norway,\n\n1:37:29.280 --> 1:37:33.360\n the Chinese government isn't interfering in any way,\n\n1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:37.280\n and we can trust them, that would lead you down one path.\n\n1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:40.680\n In my view, the reason why I progressed as I did\n\n1:37:40.680 --> 1:37:42.280\n is I felt like I had two keys,\n\n1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:45.960\n and I had one key as I live in the science world\n\n1:37:45.960 --> 1:37:50.120\n through my work with WHO and my books and things like that.\n\n1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:52.280\n But I also have another part of my life\n\n1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:57.280\n in the world of geopolitics as an Asia quote unquote expert\n\n1:37:57.680 --> 1:38:00.400\n and former National Security Council official\n\n1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:01.240\n and other things.\n\n1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:06.240\n And I felt for me, I needed both keys to open that door.\n\n1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:08.960\n But if I only had the science key,\n\n1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:11.960\n I wouldn't have had the level of doubt and suspicion\n\n1:38:11.960 --> 1:38:12.920\n that I have.\n\n1:38:12.920 --> 1:38:16.000\n But if my starting point was only doubt and suspicion,\n\n1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:17.520\n well, it's coming from China,\n\n1:38:17.520 --> 1:38:20.600\n it must be that the government is guilty,\n\n1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:22.200\n like that wouldn't help either.\n\n1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:26.600\n I wonder what's in her mind,\n\n1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:29.840\n whether it's fear or habit,\n\n1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:35.760\n because I think a lot of people in the former Soviet Union,\n\n1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:38.720\n it's like Chernobyl, it's not really fear,\n\n1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:40.600\n it's almost like a momentum.\n\n1:38:40.600 --> 1:38:45.200\n It's like the reason I showed up to this interview\n\n1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:48.000\n wearing clothes, as opposed to being naked.\n\n1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:49.360\n It's like, all right.\n\n1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:55.760\n It's like, it's just all of us are doing the clothes thing.\n\n1:38:55.760 --> 1:38:59.600\n Although there was a startup years ago called Naked News.\n\n1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:00.440\n Did you ever hear about that?\n\n1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:02.520\n They just would read the exact news.\n\n1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:03.360\n With naked.\n\n1:39:03.360 --> 1:39:06.160\n No, after each story, they'd take something off\n\n1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:08.120\n until the end, I don't think.\n\n1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:09.600\n It's a good idea for a podcast.\n\n1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:10.640\n They have an IPO.\n\n1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:13.560\n Stay tuned, next time I'm with Michael Miles.\n\n1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:14.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:14.400 --> 1:39:15.240\n Okay.\n\n1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:18.480\n So what do you think,\n\n1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:21.080\n I mean, because the reason I asked that question is,\n\n1:39:22.360 --> 1:39:25.680\n how do we kind of take steps to improve\n\n1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:27.960\n without any kind of revolutionary action?\n\n1:39:27.960 --> 1:39:32.760\n You could say, we need to inspire the Chinese people\n\n1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:37.760\n to elect, to sort of revolutionize the system\n\n1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:42.760\n from within, but like, who are we to suggest that?\n\n1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:44.760\n Because we have our flaws too.\n\n1:39:44.760 --> 1:39:47.320\n We should be working on our flaws as well.\n\n1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:51.760\n And so, but at the individual scientist level,\n\n1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:55.720\n what are the small acts of rebellion that could be done?\n\n1:39:55.720 --> 1:39:57.960\n How can we improve this?\n\n1:39:57.960 --> 1:40:01.760\n Well, so I don't know about small acts of rebellion,\n\n1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:03.920\n but I'll try to answer your question\n\n1:40:03.920 --> 1:40:07.800\n from a few different perspectives.\n\n1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:10.920\n So right now, actually, as we speak,\n\n1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:12.840\n there is a special session\n\n1:40:12.840 --> 1:40:14.600\n of the World Health Assembly going on.\n\n1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:17.440\n And the World Health Assembly is the governing authority\n\n1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:19.240\n over the World Health Organization,\n\n1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:22.440\n where it's represented by states and territories,\n\n1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:26.800\n 194 of them, tragically not including Taiwan,\n\n1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:29.160\n because of the Chinese government's assistance.\n\n1:40:29.160 --> 1:40:31.360\n But they're now beginning a process\n\n1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:35.320\n of trying to negotiate a global pandemic treaty\n\n1:40:35.320 --> 1:40:37.480\n to try to have a better process\n\n1:40:37.480 --> 1:40:42.040\n for responding to crises exactly like we're in.\n\n1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:45.440\n But unfortunately, for the exact same reasons\n\n1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:48.680\n that we have failed, I mean, we had a similar process\n\n1:40:48.680 --> 1:40:50.880\n after the first SARS, we set up what we thought\n\n1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:52.480\n was the best available system,\n\n1:40:52.480 --> 1:40:55.280\n and it has totally failed here.\n\n1:40:55.280 --> 1:41:00.280\n And it's failed here because of the inherent pathologies\n\n1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:02.760\n of the Chinese government system.\n\n1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:06.600\n We are suffering from a pandemic that exists\n\n1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:11.200\n because of the internal pathologies of the Chinese state.\n\n1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:14.720\n And that's why on one hand, I totally get this impulse.\n\n1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:17.760\n Well, we do it our way, they do it their way.\n\n1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:20.920\n Who's to say that one way is better?\n\n1:41:20.920 --> 1:41:23.320\n And certainly right now in the United States,\n\n1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:25.040\n we're at each other's throats.\n\n1:41:25.040 --> 1:41:28.800\n We have a hard time getting anything meaningful done.\n\n1:41:28.800 --> 1:41:31.280\n And I'm sure there are people who are saying,\n\n1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:33.640\n well, that model looks appealing.\n\n1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:37.440\n But just as people could look to the United States\n\n1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:39.200\n and say, well, because the United States\n\n1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:41.720\n has such a massive reach, what we do domestically\n\n1:41:41.720 --> 1:41:44.720\n has huge implications for the rest of the world,\n\n1:41:44.720 --> 1:41:48.160\n they become stakeholders in our politics.\n\n1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:49.880\n And that's why I think for a lot of years,\n\n1:41:49.880 --> 1:41:52.200\n people have just been looking at US politics,\n\n1:41:52.200 --> 1:41:53.200\n not because it's interesting,\n\n1:41:53.200 --> 1:41:55.320\n but because the decisions that we make\n\n1:41:55.320 --> 1:41:58.080\n have big implications for their lives.\n\n1:41:58.080 --> 1:41:59.760\n The same is true for ours.\n\n1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:04.200\n You could say that the lack of civil and political rights\n\n1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:08.680\n in China is, I mean, it's up to the Chinese,\n\n1:42:08.680 --> 1:42:10.360\n not even people, because they have no say,\n\n1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:12.640\n but to their government.\n\n1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:14.280\n And they weren't democratically elected,\n\n1:42:14.280 --> 1:42:17.680\n that they are recognized as the government.\n\n1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:22.680\n But some significant percentage of the 15 million people\n\n1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:26.000\n now dead from COVID are dead\n\n1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:29.680\n because in the earliest days following the outbreak,\n\n1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:33.040\n whatever the origin, the voices of people\n\n1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:35.280\n sounding the alarm were suppressed,\n\n1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:37.240\n that the Chinese government had an,\n\n1:42:37.240 --> 1:42:39.560\n just like in Chernobyl, the Chinese government\n\n1:42:39.560 --> 1:42:42.560\n had a greater incentive to lie\n\n1:42:42.560 --> 1:42:46.640\n to the international community than to tell the truth.\n\n1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:49.280\n And everybody was incentivized\n\n1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:51.920\n to pretty much do the wrong thing.\n\n1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:55.200\n And so that's why I think one of the big messages\n\n1:42:55.200 --> 1:42:57.600\n of this pandemic is that all of our fates\n\n1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:00.280\n are tied to everybody else's fates.\n\n1:43:00.280 --> 1:43:02.760\n And so while we can say and should say,\n\n1:43:02.760 --> 1:43:06.480\n well, let's focus on our own communities and our countries,\n\n1:43:06.480 --> 1:43:09.960\n we're all stakeholders in what happens elsewhere.\n\n1:43:09.960 --> 1:43:14.960\n Can I ask you a weird question?\n\n1:43:14.960 --> 1:43:19.960\n So I'm gonna do a few podcast interviews\n\n1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:24.360\n with interesting people in Russia, in the Russian language,\n\n1:43:24.360 --> 1:43:25.840\n because I could speak Russian.\n\n1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:29.160\n And a lot of those people have,\n\n1:43:30.800 --> 1:43:34.120\n are not usually speaking in these kinds of formats.\n\n1:43:36.560 --> 1:43:40.480\n Do you think it's possible to interview Xi Jinping?\n\n1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:44.480\n Do you think it's possible to interview somebody like her\n\n1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:47.320\n or anyone in the Chinese government?\n\n1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:48.680\n I think not.\n\n1:43:49.720 --> 1:43:52.520\n And I think the reason is\n\n1:43:52.520 --> 1:43:54.640\n because I think they would, one,\n\n1:43:54.640 --> 1:43:57.640\n be uncomfortable being in any environment\n\n1:43:57.640 --> 1:44:02.080\n where really unknown questions will be asked.\n\n1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:06.080\n And I actually, so as you know, on this topic,\n\n1:44:06.080 --> 1:44:07.360\n the Chinese, as I mentioned earlier,\n\n1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:10.800\n the Chinese government has a gag order on Chinese scientists.\n\n1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:13.000\n They can't speak without prior government approval.\n\n1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.600\n Xu Zhengli has been able to speak.\n\n1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:17.160\n And she's spoken at a number of forums.\n\n1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:19.960\n I mentioned this Rutgers event.\n\n1:44:19.960 --> 1:44:23.080\n What was the nature of that forum, the Rutgers event?\n\n1:44:23.080 --> 1:44:26.320\n All of them were kind of science conversations\n\n1:44:26.320 --> 1:44:31.320\n about the pandemic, including the origins issue.\n\n1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:37.080\n But I think that she, in her response to my question,\n\n1:44:37.080 --> 1:44:38.680\n it was kind of this funny thing.\n\n1:44:38.680 --> 1:44:42.680\n So they had this event organized by Rutgers.\n\n1:44:42.680 --> 1:44:45.680\n And I went on, there was an online event on Zoom,\n\n1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:47.920\n but I got on there and I just realized\n\n1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:49.480\n it was very poorly organized.\n\n1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:51.720\n Like normally the controls that you would have\n\n1:44:51.720 --> 1:44:54.320\n about who gets to chat to who, who gets to ask questions,\n\n1:44:54.320 --> 1:44:56.760\n none of them were set.\n\n1:44:56.760 --> 1:44:58.360\n And so I kind of couldn't believe it.\n\n1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:02.200\n I was just sitting at home in my neon green fleece\n\n1:45:02.200 --> 1:45:06.560\n and I just started sending chat messages to Xu Zhengli.\n\n1:45:06.560 --> 1:45:08.360\n So you could, anybody could send any.\n\n1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:09.720\n Anybody could, it was insane.\n\n1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:11.680\n But I thought, wow, this is incredible.\n\n1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:16.040\n And so then it was unclear who got to ask questions.\n\n1:45:16.040 --> 1:45:18.240\n And so I was like posting questions\n\n1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:20.680\n and then I was sending chats to the organizers\n\n1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:23.440\n of the event saying, I really have a question.\n\n1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:27.360\n And first they said, well, you can submit your questions\n\n1:45:27.360 --> 1:45:29.200\n and we'll have submitted questions.\n\n1:45:29.200 --> 1:45:31.160\n And then if we have time, we'll open up.\n\n1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:33.000\n So I just, I mean, I just thought, well, what the hell?\n\n1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:34.680\n I just sent messages to everybody.\n\n1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:37.120\n And then the event was already done.\n\n1:45:37.120 --> 1:45:39.400\n They were 15 minutes over time.\n\n1:45:39.400 --> 1:45:40.440\n And then they said, all right,\n\n1:45:40.440 --> 1:45:42.400\n we have time just for one question.\n\n1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:44.880\n And it's Jamie Metzl.\n\n1:45:44.880 --> 1:45:47.200\n And like, as I'm sitting there in my running clothes,\n\n1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:50.440\n like I wasn't, I was like multitasking and I heard my name.\n\n1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:55.440\n And so I went diving back and I asked this question\n\n1:45:55.920 --> 1:46:00.200\n about, did you know all of the work that was happening\n\n1:46:00.200 --> 1:46:05.200\n at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, not just your work?\n\n1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:10.520\n And can you confirm that US intelligence has said\n\n1:46:10.520 --> 1:46:14.240\n that the military played a role,\n\n1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:16.720\n was engaged with the Wuhan Institute of Virology?\n\n1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:19.120\n Do you deny that the Chinese military was involved\n\n1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:21.680\n in any way with the Wuhan Institute of Virology?\n\n1:46:21.680 --> 1:46:24.760\n And as I said before, she said, this is crazy.\n\n1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:26.240\n Absolutely not.\n\n1:46:26.240 --> 1:46:27.200\n It got, it actually got,\n\n1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:29.000\n that one question got covered in the media\n\n1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:32.240\n because it was like, I think an essential question.\n\n1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:35.200\n But I just think that since then, to my knowledge,\n\n1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:38.280\n she's not been in any public forums,\n\n1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:41.160\n but that's why most people would be shocked\n\n1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:43.640\n that to date there has been no comprehensive\n\n1:46:43.640 --> 1:46:46.600\n international investigation into pandemic origins.\n\n1:46:46.600 --> 1:46:49.000\n There is no whistleblower provision.\n\n1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:52.760\n So if you're, my guess is there are at least tens,\n\n1:46:52.760 --> 1:46:55.200\n maybe hundreds of people in China\n\n1:46:55.200 --> 1:46:56.960\n who have relevant information\n\n1:46:56.960 --> 1:47:00.120\n about the origins of the pandemic who are terrified\n\n1:47:00.120 --> 1:47:01.840\n and don't dare share it.\n\n1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:04.360\n And let's just say somebody wanted\n\n1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:08.480\n to get that information out, to send it somewhere.\n\n1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:10.440\n There's no official address.\n\n1:47:10.440 --> 1:47:13.920\n The WHO doesn't have that, nobody has that.\n\n1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:16.640\n And so I would love, I mean, you may as well ask.\n\n1:47:16.640 --> 1:47:21.080\n I don't think it's likely that there'll be a yes,\n\n1:47:21.080 --> 1:47:23.640\n but it could well be that there are defectors\n\n1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:25.360\n who will want to speak.\n\n1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:29.240\n So let me also push back on this idea.\n\n1:47:29.240 --> 1:47:33.400\n So one, I want to ask if the language barrier is a thing.\n\n1:47:33.400 --> 1:47:34.720\n Because I've talked to,\n\n1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:38.360\n so I understand Russian culture, I think,\n\n1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:40.440\n or not understand, this is the thing.\n\n1:47:40.440 --> 1:47:45.440\n I don't understand basically anything in this world.\n\n1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:50.440\n But I mean, I hear the music that is Russian culture\n\n1:47:50.440 --> 1:47:51.840\n and I enjoy it.\n\n1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:55.360\n I don't hear that music for Chinese culture.\n\n1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:57.000\n It's just not something I've experienced.\n\n1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:00.160\n So it's a beautiful, rich, complex culture.\n\n1:48:00.160 --> 1:48:05.160\n And from my sense, it seems distant to me.\n\n1:48:05.160 --> 1:48:10.160\n Like whenever I look, even like we mentioned offline Japan\n\n1:48:10.760 --> 1:48:13.560\n and so on, I probably don't even understand\n\n1:48:13.560 --> 1:48:14.440\n Japanese culture.\n\n1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:16.760\n I believe I kind of do because I did martial arts\n\n1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:20.200\n my whole life, but even that, it's just so distant.\n\n1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:23.360\n People who've lived in Japan, foreigners for like 20 years\n\n1:48:23.360 --> 1:48:25.240\n say the exact same thing, yeah.\n\n1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:26.200\n This makes me sad.\n\n1:48:26.200 --> 1:48:29.280\n It makes me sad because I will never be able\n\n1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:34.160\n to fully appreciate the literature, the conversations,\n\n1:48:34.160 --> 1:48:38.120\n the people, the little humor and the subtleties.\n\n1:48:38.120 --> 1:48:39.960\n And those are all essential to understand\n\n1:48:39.960 --> 1:48:43.760\n even this cold topics of science.\n\n1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:46.160\n Because all of that is important to understand.\n\n1:48:46.160 --> 1:48:48.240\n So that's a question for me if you think\n\n1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:49.760\n language barriers a thing.\n\n1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:52.120\n But the other thing I just want to kind of comment on\n\n1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:57.120\n is the criticism of journalism that somebody like\n\n1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:02.120\n Shi Zhengli or even Shi Zhengpeng, just anybody in China,\n\n1:49:05.880 --> 1:49:08.760\n very skeptical to have really conversations\n\n1:49:08.760 --> 1:49:11.400\n with anybody in the western media.\n\n1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:16.400\n Because it's like what are the odds that they will try\n\n1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:19.560\n to bring out the beautiful ideas in the person.\n\n1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:23.480\n And honestly, this is a harsh criticism.\n\n1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:28.480\n I apologize, but I kind of mean it, is the journalists\n\n1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:34.040\n that have some of these high profile conversations\n\n1:49:34.040 --> 1:49:36.800\n often don't do the work.\n\n1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:39.480\n They come off as not very intelligent.\n\n1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:41.360\n And I know they're intelligent people.\n\n1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:43.480\n They have not done the research.\n\n1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:46.520\n They have not come up and like read a bunch of books.\n\n1:49:46.520 --> 1:49:48.880\n They have not even read the Wikipedia article.\n\n1:49:48.880 --> 1:49:52.480\n Meaning put in the minimal effort to empathize,\n\n1:49:52.480 --> 1:49:54.760\n to try to understand the culture of the people,\n\n1:49:54.760 --> 1:49:58.720\n all the complexities, all the different ideas in the spaces.\n\n1:49:58.720 --> 1:50:00.920\n Do all the incredible, not all,\n\n1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:04.240\n but some of the incredible work that you've done initially.\n\n1:50:04.240 --> 1:50:07.120\n Like that, you have to do that work to earn the right\n\n1:50:07.120 --> 1:50:11.240\n to have a deep real conversation with some of these folks.\n\n1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:13.360\n And it's just disappointing to me\n\n1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:15.280\n that journalists often don't do that work.\n\n1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:19.640\n Yeah, so on that, just first I completely agree with you.\n\n1:50:19.640 --> 1:50:22.600\n I mean, there is just an incredible beauty\n\n1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:25.240\n in Chinese culture and I think all cultures,\n\n1:50:25.240 --> 1:50:29.160\n but certainly China has such a deep and rich history,\n\n1:50:29.160 --> 1:50:34.160\n amazing literature and art and just human beings.\n\n1:50:34.680 --> 1:50:38.000\n I mean, I'm a massive critic of the Chinese government.\n\n1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:42.720\n I'm very vociferous about the really genocide in Xinjiang,\n\n1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:46.560\n the absolute effort to destroy Tibetan culture,\n\n1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:51.040\n the destruction of democracy in Hong Kong,\n\n1:50:51.040 --> 1:50:54.160\n incredibly illegal efforts to seize\n\n1:50:54.160 --> 1:50:56.520\n basically the entire South China Sea.\n\n1:50:56.520 --> 1:50:59.640\n And I could go on and on and on.\n\n1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:02.680\n But Chinese culture is fantastic.\n\n1:51:02.680 --> 1:51:05.720\n And I mean, I can't speak to every technical field,\n\n1:51:05.720 --> 1:51:09.000\n but just in terms of having journalists,\n\n1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:10.560\n and I'll speak to American journalists,\n\n1:51:10.560 --> 1:51:14.880\n people like Peter Hessler who have really invested the time\n\n1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:19.480\n to live in China, to learn the language, learn the culture.\n\n1:51:19.480 --> 1:51:22.920\n Peter himself, who is maybe one of our best journalists\n\n1:51:22.920 --> 1:51:26.080\n covering China from a soul level,\n\n1:51:26.080 --> 1:51:27.920\n he was kicked out of China.\n\n1:51:27.920 --> 1:51:30.440\n So it's very, very difficult.\n\n1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:31.280\n His stuff.\n\n1:51:31.280 --> 1:51:32.120\n His stuff.\n\n1:51:32.120 --> 1:51:32.960\n Yeah, it's really, and so for me,\n\n1:51:32.960 --> 1:51:36.640\n you talked about my website on pandemic origins.\n\n1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:38.880\n So when I launched it, I had it,\n\n1:51:38.880 --> 1:51:40.520\n I'm not a Chinese speaker,\n\n1:51:40.520 --> 1:51:44.120\n but I had the entire site translated into Chinese\n\n1:51:44.120 --> 1:51:48.040\n and I have it up on my website just because I felt like,\n\n1:51:48.040 --> 1:51:51.400\n well, if somebody, I mean, the great firewall\n\n1:51:51.400 --> 1:51:53.760\n makes it very, very difficult for people in China\n\n1:51:53.760 --> 1:51:56.320\n to access that kind of information.\n\n1:51:56.320 --> 1:51:58.520\n But I figured if somebody gets there\n\n1:51:58.520 --> 1:52:02.000\n and they wanna have it in their own language.\n\n1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.320\n But it's hard because the Chinese government\n\n1:52:04.320 --> 1:52:08.560\n is represented by these quote unquote wolf warriors,\n\n1:52:08.560 --> 1:52:11.840\n which is, it's like these basic ruffians.\n\n1:52:11.840 --> 1:52:15.440\n And I personally was condemned by name\n\n1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:17.560\n by the spokesman of the Chinese foreign ministry\n\n1:52:17.560 --> 1:52:20.680\n from the podium in Beijing.\n\n1:52:20.680 --> 1:52:24.160\n And so it's really hard because I absolutely think\n\n1:52:25.160 --> 1:52:27.800\n the American people and the Chinese people,\n\n1:52:27.800 --> 1:52:31.280\n I mean, maybe all people, but we have so much in common.\n\n1:52:31.280 --> 1:52:36.240\n I mean, yes, China is an ancient civilization,\n\n1:52:36.240 --> 1:52:38.880\n but they kind of wiped out their own civilization\n\n1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:41.240\n in the great leap forward and cultural revolution.\n\n1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:44.960\n They burned their scrolls, they smashed their artworks.\n\n1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:47.440\n And so it's a very young society,\n\n1:52:47.440 --> 1:52:50.600\n kind of like America is a young society.\n\n1:52:50.600 --> 1:52:52.760\n So we have a lot in common.\n\n1:52:53.760 --> 1:52:57.040\n And if we just kind of got out of our own ways,\n\n1:52:57.040 --> 1:52:59.640\n we could have a beautiful relationship,\n\n1:52:59.640 --> 1:53:01.960\n but there's a lot of things that are happening.\n\n1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:04.120\n Certainly the United States feels responsible\n\n1:53:04.120 --> 1:53:07.280\n to defend the post war international order\n\n1:53:07.280 --> 1:53:09.760\n that past generations helped build.\n\n1:53:09.760 --> 1:53:11.800\n And I'm a certain believer in that\n\n1:53:11.800 --> 1:53:16.600\n and China is challenging that and the Chinese government\n\n1:53:16.600 --> 1:53:18.600\n and they've shared that with that view\n\n1:53:18.600 --> 1:53:19.680\n with the Chinese people feel\n\n1:53:19.680 --> 1:53:21.760\n that they haven't been adequately respected.\n\n1:53:21.760 --> 1:53:26.000\n And now they're building a massive nuclear arsenal\n\n1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:29.120\n and all these other things to try to position themselves\n\n1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:31.160\n in the world with an articulated goal\n\n1:53:31.160 --> 1:53:33.040\n of being the lead country in the world.\n\n1:53:33.040 --> 1:53:34.880\n And that puts them at odds with the United States.\n\n1:53:34.880 --> 1:53:37.560\n So there are a lot of real reasons\n\n1:53:37.560 --> 1:53:39.960\n that we need to be honest about for division.\n\n1:53:39.960 --> 1:53:42.480\n But if that's all we focus on,\n\n1:53:42.480 --> 1:53:45.680\n if we don't say that there's another side of the story\n\n1:53:45.680 --> 1:53:47.680\n that brings us together,\n\n1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:51.320\n we'll put ourselves on an inevitable glide path\n\n1:53:51.320 --> 1:53:52.440\n to a terrible outcome.\n\n1:53:53.480 --> 1:53:55.840\n What do you make of Xi Jinping?\n\n1:53:57.000 --> 1:53:57.920\n So two questions.\n\n1:53:57.920 --> 1:54:01.280\n So one in general and two more on lab leak\n\n1:54:01.280 --> 1:54:05.600\n and his meeting with our president Biden\n\n1:54:05.600 --> 1:54:07.800\n in discussion of lab leak.\n\n1:54:07.800 --> 1:54:12.800\n So I feel that Xi Jinping has a very narrow goal\n\n1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:17.640\n articulated of establishing China\n\n1:54:17.640 --> 1:54:20.120\n as the lead country in the world\n\n1:54:20.120 --> 1:54:22.880\n by the 100th anniversary of the founding\n\n1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:26.360\n of the modern Chinese state.\n\n1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:29.720\n And it's ruthless and it's strategic.\n\n1:54:29.720 --> 1:54:33.680\n There's a great book called The Long Game by Rush Doshi\n\n1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:36.720\n who's actually now working in the White House\n\n1:54:36.720 --> 1:54:41.360\n about this goal and our pretty clearly articulated goal\n\n1:54:41.360 --> 1:54:45.040\n to subvert the post war international order\n\n1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:47.200\n and in China's interest.\n\n1:54:47.200 --> 1:54:50.560\n And maybe every leader wants to organize the world\n\n1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:51.480\n around their interest.\n\n1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:56.320\n But I feel that his vision of what that entails\n\n1:54:56.320 --> 1:54:59.120\n is not one that I think is shareable\n\n1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:00.040\n for the rest of the world.\n\n1:55:00.040 --> 1:55:01.600\n I mean, the strength of the United States\n\n1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:04.480\n with all of our flaws is particularly\n\n1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:06.840\n in that post war period,\n\n1:55:06.840 --> 1:55:10.280\n we put forward a model that was desirable\n\n1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:11.120\n to a lot of people.\n\n1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:13.640\n Certainly it was desirable to people in Western Europe\n\n1:55:13.640 --> 1:55:17.800\n and then Eastern Europe and Japan and Korea.\n\n1:55:17.800 --> 1:55:18.800\n Doesn't mean it's perfect.\n\n1:55:18.800 --> 1:55:21.520\n The United States is deeply flawed.\n\n1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:23.520\n As articulated to date,\n\n1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:26.760\n I don't think most people and countries\n\n1:55:26.760 --> 1:55:30.280\n would like to live in a Sinocentric world.\n\n1:55:30.280 --> 1:55:32.400\n And so I certainly, as I mentioned before,\n\n1:55:32.400 --> 1:55:34.960\n I'm a huge critic of what Xi Jinping is doing,\n\n1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:39.240\n the incredible brutality in Xinjiang,\n\n1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:42.560\n in Tibet and elsewhere.\n\n1:55:42.560 --> 1:55:47.560\n Yeah, the censorship one gives me a lot of trouble\n\n1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:51.120\n on the science realm and just in journalism\n\n1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:53.440\n and just the world that prevents us\n\n1:55:53.440 --> 1:55:56.200\n from having conversations with each other.\n\n1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:58.640\n Do you know about the Winnie the Pooh thing?\n\n1:55:58.640 --> 1:56:01.040\n Yes, I mean, it's ridiculous.\n\n1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:03.680\n So to me, that's such a good illustration\n\n1:56:03.680 --> 1:56:07.400\n of censorship being petty.\n\n1:56:08.240 --> 1:56:09.720\n But censorship has to be petty\n\n1:56:09.720 --> 1:56:12.160\n because the goal of censorship,\n\n1:56:12.160 --> 1:56:14.720\n maybe you experienced in the Soviet Union,\n\n1:56:14.720 --> 1:56:16.560\n is to get into your head.\n\n1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:17.840\n Like if it's just censorship,\n\n1:56:17.840 --> 1:56:20.720\n like you say down with the state\n\n1:56:20.720 --> 1:56:22.720\n and like you can't say that,\n\n1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:26.200\n but you can say all the other things up to that point,\n\n1:56:26.200 --> 1:56:28.520\n eventually people will feel empowered\n\n1:56:28.520 --> 1:56:29.600\n to say down with the state.\n\n1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:30.960\n And so I think the goal\n\n1:56:30.960 --> 1:56:33.760\n of this kind of authoritarian censorship\n\n1:56:33.760 --> 1:56:36.200\n is to turn you into the censor.\n\n1:56:36.200 --> 1:56:38.280\n And so the...\n\n1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:39.120\n Like self censor.\n\n1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:41.480\n Yeah, because they almost have to have you think,\n\n1:56:41.480 --> 1:56:43.560\n well, if I'm gonna make any criticism,\n\n1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:45.880\n maybe they're gonna come and get me.\n\n1:56:45.880 --> 1:56:48.560\n So it's safer to not do it.\n\n1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:50.280\n I mean, I've traveled through North Korea\n\n1:56:50.280 --> 1:56:53.480\n pretty extensively and I've seen that in its ultimate form,\n\n1:56:53.480 --> 1:56:56.760\n but that's what they're trying to do in China too.\n\n1:56:56.760 --> 1:57:00.080\n Yeah, so for people who are not familiar,\n\n1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:01.680\n it's such a clear illustration\n\n1:57:01.680 --> 1:57:03.880\n of just the pettiness of censorship\n\n1:57:03.880 --> 1:57:07.200\n and leaders, the corrupting nature of power.\n\n1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:10.880\n But there's a meme of Xi Jinping\n\n1:57:10.880 --> 1:57:13.840\n with, I guess, Barack Obama.\n\n1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:18.400\n And the meme is that he looks like Winnie the Pooh\n\n1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:20.800\n in that picture.\n\n1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:25.200\n And that was the President Xi Jinping\n\n1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:26.400\n looks like Winnie the Pooh.\n\n1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:30.040\n And I guess that became, because that got censored,\n\n1:57:30.040 --> 1:57:32.240\n like mentions of Winnie the Pooh got censored\n\n1:57:32.240 --> 1:57:33.760\n all across China.\n\n1:57:33.760 --> 1:57:38.200\n Winnie the Pooh became the unknowing revolutionary hero\n\n1:57:38.200 --> 1:57:41.560\n that represents freedom of speech and so on.\n\n1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:44.800\n But it's just such a absurd...\n\n1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:47.800\n Because we spend so much time in this conversation\n\n1:57:47.800 --> 1:57:49.720\n talking about the censorship\n\n1:57:49.720 --> 1:57:52.400\n that's a little bit more understandable to me,\n\n1:57:52.400 --> 1:57:55.320\n which is like, we messed up.\n\n1:57:55.320 --> 1:57:59.680\n And it wasn't, maybe it's almost understandable errors\n\n1:57:59.680 --> 1:58:02.680\n that happen in the progress of science.\n\n1:58:02.680 --> 1:58:05.520\n I mean, you could always argue\n\n1:58:05.520 --> 1:58:09.160\n that there's a lot of mistakes along the way\n\n1:58:09.160 --> 1:58:11.920\n and the censorship along the way caused the big mistake.\n\n1:58:11.920 --> 1:58:14.320\n You can argue that same way for the Chernobyl.\n\n1:58:14.320 --> 1:58:18.280\n But those are sort of understandable and difficult topics.\n\n1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:19.800\n Like Winnie the Pooh.\n\n1:58:19.800 --> 1:58:22.160\n But in your message, it shows both sides of the story.\n\n1:58:22.160 --> 1:58:26.280\n I mean, one, how petty authoritarian censors have to be.\n\n1:58:26.280 --> 1:58:29.160\n And that's why the messaging from the Chinese government\n\n1:58:29.160 --> 1:58:30.640\n is so consistent.\n\n1:58:30.640 --> 1:58:32.480\n No matter who you are,\n\n1:58:32.480 --> 1:58:33.960\n you have to be careful what you say.\n\n1:58:33.960 --> 1:58:37.200\n And that's why it's the story of Peng Shui,\n\n1:58:37.200 --> 1:58:38.600\n the tennis player.\n\n1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:42.360\n She dared raise her voice in an individual way.\n\n1:58:42.360 --> 1:58:46.840\n Jack Ma, the richest man in China,\n\n1:58:46.840 --> 1:58:50.440\n had a minor criticism of the Chinese government.\n\n1:58:50.440 --> 1:58:54.560\n He had basically disappeared from the public eye.\n\n1:58:54.560 --> 1:58:57.560\n Fan Bingbing, who's like one of the leading\n\n1:58:57.560 --> 1:58:59.320\n Chinese movie stars,\n\n1:58:59.320 --> 1:59:03.320\n she was seen as not loyal enough and she just vanished.\n\n1:59:03.320 --> 1:59:06.240\n And so the message is no matter who you are,\n\n1:59:06.240 --> 1:59:08.080\n no matter what level,\n\n1:59:08.080 --> 1:59:11.520\n if you don't mind everything you say,\n\n1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:12.680\n you could lose everything.\n\n1:59:12.680 --> 1:59:15.160\n I'm pretty hopeful, optimistic about a lot of things.\n\n1:59:15.160 --> 1:59:18.920\n And so for me, if the Chinese government stays\n\n1:59:19.840 --> 1:59:21.160\n with its current structure,\n\n1:59:21.160 --> 1:59:24.600\n I think what I hope they start fixing\n\n1:59:24.600 --> 1:59:26.600\n is the freedom of speech.\n\n1:59:26.600 --> 1:59:27.440\n But they can't.\n\n1:59:27.440 --> 1:59:32.200\n I mean, the thing is if they open up freedom of speech\n\n1:59:32.200 --> 1:59:34.320\n really in a meaningful way,\n\n1:59:34.320 --> 1:59:38.320\n they can't maintain their current form of government.\n\n1:59:38.320 --> 1:59:40.320\n And it's connected, as I was saying before,\n\n1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:42.520\n to the origins of the pandemic.\n\n1:59:42.520 --> 1:59:45.040\n I mean, if my hypothesis was right,\n\n1:59:45.040 --> 1:59:48.840\n that was the big choice that the national government had.\n\n1:59:48.840 --> 1:59:51.760\n Do we really investigate the origins of the pandemic?\n\n1:59:51.760 --> 1:59:55.600\n Do we deliver a message that transparency is required,\n\n1:59:55.600 --> 1:59:58.840\n public transparency is required from local officials?\n\n1:59:58.840 --> 2:00:02.040\n If they do that, the entire system collapsed.\n\n2:00:02.040 --> 2:00:06.600\n Pretty much everybody in China has a relative\n\n2:00:06.600 --> 2:00:09.800\n who has died as a result of the actions\n\n2:00:09.800 --> 2:00:10.760\n of the Communist Party,\n\n2:00:10.760 --> 2:00:12.600\n particularly in the Great Leap Forward.\n\n2:00:12.600 --> 2:00:15.160\n It's nearly 50 million people died\n\n2:00:15.160 --> 2:00:18.560\n as a result of Mao's disastrous policies.\n\n2:00:18.560 --> 2:00:21.800\n And yet why is Mao's picture still on Tiananmen Square\n\n2:00:21.800 --> 2:00:23.520\n and it's on the money?\n\n2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:26.040\n Because maintaining that fiction\n\n2:00:26.040 --> 2:00:29.880\n is the foundation of the legitimacy of the Chinese state.\n\n2:00:29.880 --> 2:00:32.280\n If people were allowed, just say what you want.\n\n2:00:32.280 --> 2:00:35.160\n Do you really think Mao was such a great guy,\n\n2:00:35.160 --> 2:00:39.280\n even though your own relatives are dead as a result?\n\n2:00:39.280 --> 2:00:43.840\n Do you really buy even on this story\n\n2:00:43.840 --> 2:00:45.240\n that China did nothing wrong,\n\n2:00:45.240 --> 2:00:48.240\n even though in the earliest days of the pandemic,\n\n2:00:48.240 --> 2:00:51.120\n these two, at least Chinese scientists themselves,\n\n2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:54.960\n courageously issued a preprint paper\n\n2:00:54.960 --> 2:00:58.600\n that was later almost certainly forcibly retracted,\n\n2:00:58.600 --> 2:01:00.360\n saying, well, this looks like this comes\n\n2:01:00.360 --> 2:01:03.320\n from one of the Wuhan labs that we're studying.\n\n2:01:03.320 --> 2:01:06.880\n Like if you opened up that window,\n\n2:01:06.880 --> 2:01:09.640\n I think that the Chinese government\n\n2:01:09.640 --> 2:01:12.400\n would not be able to continue in its current form.\n\n2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:14.960\n And that's why they cracked down at Tiananmen Square.\n\n2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:17.840\n That's why with Feng Shui, the tennis player,\n\n2:01:17.840 --> 2:01:21.040\n if they had let her accuse somebody\n\n2:01:21.040 --> 2:01:24.680\n from the Communist Party of sexual assault,\n\n2:01:24.680 --> 2:01:26.960\n and they said, okay, now people,\n\n2:01:26.960 --> 2:01:28.560\n you can use social media\n\n2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:30.600\n and you can have your me too moment\n\n2:01:30.600 --> 2:01:34.600\n and let us know who in the Chinese Communist Party\n\n2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:37.480\n or your boss in a business has assaulted you.\n\n2:01:37.480 --> 2:01:38.720\n Just like in every society,\n\n2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:40.040\n I'm sure there's tons of women\n\n2:01:40.040 --> 2:01:45.040\n who've been sexually assaulted, manipulated, abused by men.\n\n2:01:45.480 --> 2:01:48.480\n And so I certainly hope\n\n2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:51.200\n that there can be that kind of opening.\n\n2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:54.300\n But if I were an authoritarian dictator,\n\n2:01:54.300 --> 2:01:56.640\n that's the thing I would be most afraid of.\n\n2:01:56.640 --> 2:01:58.040\n Yeah, dictator perhaps,\n\n2:01:58.040 --> 2:02:01.240\n but I think you can gradually increase the freedom of speech.\n\n2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:04.840\n So I think you can maintain control over the freedom\n\n2:02:04.840 --> 2:02:06.160\n of press first.\n\n2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:08.320\n So control the press more,\n\n2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:13.320\n but let the lower levels sort of open up YouTube, right?\n\n2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:17.000\n Open up like where individual citizens can make content.\n\n2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:19.100\n I mean, there's a lot of benefits to that.\n\n2:02:19.100 --> 2:02:22.760\n And then from an authoritarian perspective,\n\n2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:25.600\n you can just say that's misinformation,\n\n2:02:25.600 --> 2:02:28.420\n that's conspiracy theories, all those kinds of things.\n\n2:02:28.420 --> 2:02:32.560\n But at least I think if you open up that freedom of speech\n\n2:02:32.560 --> 2:02:34.580\n at the level of the individual citizen,\n\n2:02:35.880 --> 2:02:38.000\n that's good for entrepreneurship,\n\n2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:39.600\n for the development of ideas,\n\n2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:41.440\n of exchange of ideas, all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:02:41.440 --> 2:02:44.160\n I just think that increased the GDP of the country.\n\n2:02:44.160 --> 2:02:46.080\n So I think there's a lot of benefits.\n\n2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:48.360\n I feel like you can still play,\n\n2:02:48.360 --> 2:02:50.800\n we're playing some like dark thoughts here,\n\n2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:54.620\n but I feel like you could still play the game of thrones,\n\n2:02:54.620 --> 2:02:59.620\n still maintain power while giving freedom to the citizenry.\n\n2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:04.200\n Like I think just like with North Korea is a good example\n\n2:03:04.200 --> 2:03:07.320\n of where cracking down too much\n\n2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:10.360\n can completely destroy your country.\n\n2:03:10.360 --> 2:03:14.520\n Like there's some balance you can strike in your evil mind\n\n2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:17.400\n and still maintain authoritarian control over the country.\n\n2:03:17.400 --> 2:03:20.960\n Obviously, it's not obvious,\n\n2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:24.080\n but I'm a big supporter of freedom of speech.\n\n2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:26.560\n I mean, it seems to work really well.\n\n2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:28.000\n I don't know what the failure cases\n\n2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:29.280\n for freedom of speech are.\n\n2:03:30.420 --> 2:03:32.800\n Probably we're experiencing them with Twitter\n\n2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:34.320\n and like where the nature of truth\n\n2:03:34.320 --> 2:03:38.960\n is being completely kind of flipped upside down.\n\n2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:41.640\n But it seems like on the whole,\n\n2:03:41.640 --> 2:03:46.640\n ability to defeat lies with more,\n\n2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:50.780\n not through censorship, but through more conversations,\n\n2:03:50.780 --> 2:03:53.120\n more information is the right way to go.\n\n2:03:53.120 --> 2:03:54.720\n Can I tell you a little story, true stories\n\n2:03:54.720 --> 2:03:56.000\n about North Korea?\n\n2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.560\n So a number of years ago, I was invited\n\n2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:01.720\n to be part of a small six person delegation\n\n2:04:01.720 --> 2:04:04.800\n advising the government of North Korea\n\n2:04:04.800 --> 2:04:07.360\n on how to establish special economic zones\n\n2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:10.560\n because other countries have used these SEZs\n\n2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:13.000\n as a way of building their economies.\n\n2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:15.640\n And when I was invited, I thought,\n\n2:04:15.640 --> 2:04:17.900\n well, maybe there's an opening.\n\n2:04:17.900 --> 2:04:19.980\n And I certainly believe in that.\n\n2:04:19.980 --> 2:04:24.560\n So we flew to China across the border into North Korea.\n\n2:04:24.560 --> 2:04:27.360\n And then we were met by our partners\n\n2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:30.060\n from the North Korean Development Organization.\n\n2:04:30.060 --> 2:04:33.960\n And then we zigzagged the country for almost two weeks\n\n2:04:33.960 --> 2:04:38.060\n visiting all these sites for where they were intended\n\n2:04:38.060 --> 2:04:39.840\n to create these special economic zones.\n\n2:04:39.840 --> 2:04:42.680\n And in each site, they had their local officials\n\n2:04:42.680 --> 2:04:45.320\n and they had a map and they showed us where everything\n\n2:04:45.320 --> 2:04:47.080\n that was going to be built.\n\n2:04:47.080 --> 2:04:50.320\n And the other people who were like really technical experts\n\n2:04:50.320 --> 2:04:52.120\n on how to set up a special economic zone,\n\n2:04:52.120 --> 2:04:53.800\n they were asking questions, well, like,\n\n2:04:53.800 --> 2:04:55.760\n should you put the entrance over here\n\n2:04:55.760 --> 2:04:56.960\n or shouldn't you put it over there\n\n2:04:56.960 --> 2:04:58.480\n and what if there's flooding?\n\n2:04:58.480 --> 2:05:00.480\n And I kept asking just these basic questions,\n\n2:05:00.480 --> 2:05:02.960\n like, what do you think you're going to do here?\n\n2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:05.280\n Why do you think you can be competitive?\n\n2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:07.880\n Do you know anything about who you're competing against?\n\n2:05:07.880 --> 2:05:10.580\n Are you empowering your workers to innovate\n\n2:05:10.580 --> 2:05:12.600\n because everybody else is innovating?\n\n2:05:12.600 --> 2:05:14.880\n So at the end of the trip, they flew us to Pyongyang\n\n2:05:14.880 --> 2:05:15.840\n and they put us in this,\n\n2:05:15.840 --> 2:05:17.480\n it looked kind of like the United Nations.\n\n2:05:17.480 --> 2:05:20.240\n They probably had 500 people there\n\n2:05:20.240 --> 2:05:22.960\n and I gave a speech to them.\n\n2:05:22.960 --> 2:05:26.560\n I obviously was in English and it was translated\n\n2:05:26.560 --> 2:05:29.920\n and I figured, you know, I've come all this way,\n\n2:05:29.920 --> 2:05:30.940\n I'm just going to be honest.\n\n2:05:30.940 --> 2:05:34.760\n If they arrest me for being honest, that's on them.\n\n2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:38.000\n And I said, I'm here because I believe\n\n2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:39.700\n we can never give up hope,\n\n2:05:39.700 --> 2:05:41.460\n that we always have to try to connect.\n\n2:05:41.460 --> 2:05:45.440\n I'm also here because I think that North Korea\n\n2:05:45.440 --> 2:05:50.240\n connecting to the world economy is an important first step.\n\n2:05:50.240 --> 2:05:52.680\n But having visited all of your special economic zone sites\n\n2:05:52.680 --> 2:05:56.100\n and having met with all of your, or many of your officials,\n\n2:05:56.100 --> 2:05:59.440\n I don't think your plan has any chance of succeeding\n\n2:05:59.440 --> 2:06:03.640\n because you're trying to sell into a global market,\n\n2:06:03.640 --> 2:06:07.520\n but you need to have market information that,\n\n2:06:07.520 --> 2:06:10.920\n and I gave examples of GE and others\n\n2:06:10.920 --> 2:06:14.640\n that the innovation can't only happen at one place.\n\n2:06:14.640 --> 2:06:17.800\n And if you want innovation to happen\n\n2:06:17.800 --> 2:06:19.360\n from the people who are doing this,\n\n2:06:19.360 --> 2:06:22.400\n you have to empower them, they have to have access,\n\n2:06:22.400 --> 2:06:23.520\n they have to have voice.\n\n2:06:23.520 --> 2:06:28.520\n I mean, nobody, I mean, the people after,\n\n2:06:28.600 --> 2:06:30.160\n they kind of had to condemn me\n\n2:06:30.160 --> 2:06:32.600\n because what I was saying was challenging.\n\n2:06:32.600 --> 2:06:33.880\n So I certainly agree with you.\n\n2:06:33.880 --> 2:06:36.800\n And then just one side story of then that night,\n\n2:06:37.800 --> 2:06:39.040\n and it was just kind of bizarre\n\n2:06:39.040 --> 2:06:42.400\n because North Korea is, it's so desperately poor,\n\n2:06:42.400 --> 2:06:44.440\n but they were trying to impress us.\n\n2:06:44.440 --> 2:06:49.300\n And so we had these embarrassingly sumptuous banquets.\n\n2:06:49.300 --> 2:06:51.600\n And so for our final dinner that night,\n\n2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:54.760\n really it looked like something from Beauty and the Beast.\n\n2:06:54.760 --> 2:06:59.520\n I mean, it was like China and waiters and tuxedos,\n\n2:06:59.520 --> 2:07:02.120\n and they had this beautiful dinner.\n\n2:07:02.120 --> 2:07:04.240\n And then afterwards,\n\n2:07:04.240 --> 2:07:05.580\n because we'd now spent two weeks\n\n2:07:05.580 --> 2:07:07.060\n with our North Korean partners,\n\n2:07:07.060 --> 2:07:08.980\n they brought out this karaoke machine\n\n2:07:08.980 --> 2:07:11.060\n and our North Korean counterparts,\n\n2:07:11.060 --> 2:07:15.240\n they sang songs to us in Korean.\n\n2:07:15.240 --> 2:07:18.120\n And so I said, well, we want to reciprocate.\n\n2:07:18.120 --> 2:07:21.240\n Do you have any English songs on your karaoke machine?\n\n2:07:21.240 --> 2:07:23.320\n It's North Korea, obviously they didn't.\n\n2:07:23.320 --> 2:07:25.560\n But there was, I said, well, I have an idea.\n\n2:07:25.560 --> 2:07:27.120\n And so there was one of the women\n\n2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:30.200\n who'd been part of the North Korean delegation.\n\n2:07:30.200 --> 2:07:32.640\n She was able just to play the piano,\n\n2:07:32.640 --> 2:07:34.400\n just like you could hum a tune\n\n2:07:34.400 --> 2:07:36.160\n and she could play it on the piano.\n\n2:07:36.160 --> 2:07:39.480\n And so I said, all right, here's this tune,\n\n2:07:39.480 --> 2:07:41.000\n which I whispered in her ear.\n\n2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:42.420\n When I give you the signal,\n\n2:07:42.420 --> 2:07:45.400\n just play this tune over and over.\n\n2:07:45.400 --> 2:07:48.200\n And so I got these, I mean, there were the six of us\n\n2:07:48.200 --> 2:07:49.640\n and maybe 20 North Koreans,\n\n2:07:49.640 --> 2:07:51.080\n and we were all in a circle,\n\n2:07:51.080 --> 2:07:54.920\n so everybody hold hands and then put your right,\n\n2:07:54.920 --> 2:07:57.600\n just try to put your right foot in front of your left\n\n2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:00.560\n and then left foot in front of the right, going sideways.\n\n2:08:00.560 --> 2:08:02.480\n And I said, all right, hit it.\n\n2:08:02.480 --> 2:08:06.840\n And she played a North Korean version of Hava Nagila.\n\n2:08:06.840 --> 2:08:08.120\n And I think it was the first\n\n2:08:08.120 --> 2:08:11.680\n and only horror that they've ever done in North Korea.\n\n2:08:11.680 --> 2:08:12.500\n That's hilarious.\n\n2:08:12.500 --> 2:08:13.340\n I survived.\n\n2:08:13.340 --> 2:08:14.220\n Was this recorded or no?\n\n2:08:14.220 --> 2:08:15.060\n It was not.\n\n2:08:15.060 --> 2:08:15.880\n Oh, no.\n\n2:08:15.880 --> 2:08:18.160\n Yeah, if they had free YouTube,\n\n2:08:18.160 --> 2:08:19.520\n this would have been a big one.\n\n2:08:19.520 --> 2:08:20.360\n Yeah.\n\n2:08:21.520 --> 2:08:23.080\n Let's return to the beginning\n\n2:08:23.080 --> 2:08:26.980\n and just patient zero.\n\n2:08:28.520 --> 2:08:30.760\n It's kind of always incredible to think\n\n2:08:30.760 --> 2:08:33.840\n that there's one human at which it all started.\n\n2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:36.360\n Yeah.\n\n2:08:36.360 --> 2:08:38.760\n Who do you think was patient zero?\n\n2:08:38.760 --> 2:08:42.640\n Do you think it was somebody that worked\n\n2:08:42.640 --> 2:08:47.400\n at Wuhan Institute of Virology?\n\n2:08:47.400 --> 2:08:52.400\n Do you think there was a leak of some other kind\n\n2:08:52.440 --> 2:08:55.040\n that led to the infection?\n\n2:08:55.040 --> 2:08:55.920\n What do we know?\n\n2:08:55.920 --> 2:08:59.800\n Because there's this December 8th slash December 16th case\n\n2:08:59.800 --> 2:09:04.400\n of maybe you can describe what that is.\n\n2:09:04.400 --> 2:09:09.400\n And then there's like, what's his name?\n\n2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:12.960\n Michael Warobey has a nice timeline.\n\n2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:14.480\n I'm sure you have a timeline.\n\n2:09:14.480 --> 2:09:17.880\n But he has a nice timeline that puts the average\n\n2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:22.280\n at like November something, like 18th and November 16th\n\n2:09:22.280 --> 2:09:27.200\n as the average estimate for when the patient zero\n\n2:09:27.200 --> 2:09:30.360\n got infected, when the first human infection happened.\n\n2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:32.080\n Yeah, so just two points.\n\n2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:36.560\n One is it may be that there's infectee zero\n\n2:09:36.560 --> 2:09:37.880\n and patient zero.\n\n2:09:37.880 --> 2:09:41.280\n It could be that the first person infected was asymptomatic\n\n2:09:41.280 --> 2:09:42.440\n because we know there's a lot of people\n\n2:09:42.440 --> 2:09:44.240\n who are asymptomatic.\n\n2:09:44.240 --> 2:09:47.640\n And then there's the question of, well, who is patient zero?\n\n2:09:47.640 --> 2:09:51.040\n Meaning the first person to present themselves\n\n2:09:51.040 --> 2:09:53.600\n in some kind of health facility\n\n2:09:53.600 --> 2:09:56.400\n where that diagnosis could be made.\n\n2:09:56.400 --> 2:09:58.640\n So can we actually linger on that definition?\n\n2:09:58.640 --> 2:09:59.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:59.480 --> 2:10:02.600\n So is that to you a good definition of patient zero?\n\n2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:04.560\n Okay, there's a bunch of stuff here\n\n2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:06.640\n because this virus is weird.\n\n2:10:06.640 --> 2:10:11.120\n So one is who gets infected, one who is infectious\n\n2:10:11.120 --> 2:10:14.400\n or the first person infect others.\n\n2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:15.240\n Yeah.\n\n2:10:15.240 --> 2:10:17.360\n And who shows up to a hospital.\n\n2:10:17.360 --> 2:10:19.480\n Yeah, so I think that's why I'm calling the first person\n\n2:10:19.480 --> 2:10:22.600\n to show up to a hospital who's diagnosed with COVID 19.\n\n2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:24.560\n I'm calling that person patient zero.\n\n2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:28.480\n There's also, there's somewhere the first person\n\n2:10:28.480 --> 2:10:29.760\n to be infected.\n\n2:10:29.760 --> 2:10:32.800\n And that person maybe never showed up in a hospital\n\n2:10:32.800 --> 2:10:36.400\n because maybe they were asymptomatic and never get sick,\n\n2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:37.240\n so got sick.\n\n2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:40.560\n So let me start with what I'm calling infectee zero.\n\n2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:41.720\n Here are some options.\n\n2:10:41.720 --> 2:10:46.320\n I talked before about some person who was a villager\n\n2:10:46.320 --> 2:10:47.720\n and some remote village.\n\n2:10:47.720 --> 2:10:51.680\n It's almost impossible to imagine, but possible to imagine\n\n2:10:51.680 --> 2:10:54.000\n because strange things happen.\n\n2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:57.280\n And that person somehow gets to Wuhan.\n\n2:10:57.280 --> 2:11:00.400\n By the way, just to still make that argument,\n\n2:11:00.400 --> 2:11:01.920\n there's not an argument, it's a statement,\n\n2:11:01.920 --> 2:11:05.440\n but strange things happen all the time.\n\n2:11:05.440 --> 2:11:06.280\n No, I agree.\n\n2:11:06.280 --> 2:11:09.160\n It doesn't mean that logic doesn't apply\n\n2:11:09.160 --> 2:11:11.400\n and probabilities don't apply, but we all,\n\n2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:16.400\n I mean, in general principle, everyone, if we were honest,\n\n2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:19.000\n should be agnostic about everything.\n\n2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:23.520\n Like I think I'm Jamie, but is there a 0.01% chance\n\n2:11:23.520 --> 2:11:27.200\n or 0.001% chance that I'm not?\n\n2:11:27.200 --> 2:11:28.200\n But it could be.\n\n2:11:28.200 --> 2:11:29.040\n I mean, how would I know?\n\n2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:30.360\n But there's a large number of people arguing\n\n2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:31.880\n about the meaning of the word I\n\n2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:33.080\n and that I'm Jamie.\n\n2:11:33.080 --> 2:11:33.920\n So exactly.\n\n2:11:33.920 --> 2:11:34.760\n What is consciousness?\n\n2:11:34.760 --> 2:11:35.600\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:39.160\n So we could spend another three hours going into that one.\n\n2:11:39.160 --> 2:11:42.120\n So one possibility is there's some remote villager.\n\n2:11:42.120 --> 2:11:47.120\n Another possibility is there's somehow bizarrely,\n\n2:11:47.600 --> 2:11:49.040\n there are these infected animals\n\n2:11:49.040 --> 2:11:52.120\n that come from Southern China most likely.\n\n2:11:52.120 --> 2:11:55.800\n They all, maybe there's only one of them that's infected,\n\n2:11:55.800 --> 2:11:58.080\n which how could that possibly be?\n\n2:11:58.080 --> 2:11:59.840\n And it's only sent to Wuhan.\n\n2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:02.840\n It's not sent anywhere else,\n\n2:12:02.840 --> 2:12:04.160\n to any of the markets there or whatever.\n\n2:12:04.160 --> 2:12:06.760\n And then maybe somebody in a market is infected.\n\n2:12:06.760 --> 2:12:10.400\n That's one remote possibility, but a possibility.\n\n2:12:10.400 --> 2:12:13.240\n Another is that researchers\n\n2:12:13.240 --> 2:12:15.640\n from the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:17.520\n go down to Southern China.\n\n2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:19.000\n We didn't, we haven't talked about it yet,\n\n2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:22.960\n but in 2012, there were six miners were sent\n\n2:12:22.960 --> 2:12:26.360\n into a copper mine in Southern China and Yunnan province.\n\n2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:28.040\n All of them got very sick\n\n2:12:28.040 --> 2:12:31.800\n with what now appear like COVID 19 like symptoms.\n\n2:12:31.800 --> 2:12:34.280\n Half of them died.\n\n2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:37.560\n Blood samples from them were taken\n\n2:12:37.560 --> 2:12:40.720\n to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and elsewhere.\n\n2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:45.720\n And then after that, there were multiple site visits\n\n2:12:45.720 --> 2:12:49.400\n to that mine, collecting viral samples\n\n2:12:49.400 --> 2:12:52.560\n that were brought to the Wuhan Institute of Virology,\n\n2:12:52.560 --> 2:12:55.960\n included among those samples were,\n\n2:12:55.960 --> 2:12:59.120\n was this now infamous RETG 13 virus,\n\n2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:02.240\n which is among the genetically closest viruses\n\n2:13:02.240 --> 2:13:03.880\n to SARS CoV2.\n\n2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:07.360\n There were other nine other or eight other viruses\n\n2:13:07.360 --> 2:13:08.960\n that were collected from that mine\n\n2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:11.760\n that were presumably very similar to that.\n\n2:13:11.760 --> 2:13:14.720\n And again, we have no access to the information\n\n2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:17.920\n about those and many of the other,\n\n2:13:17.920 --> 2:13:19.760\n most, almost all of the other viruses.\n\n2:13:19.760 --> 2:13:24.120\n So could it be that one of the people\n\n2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:26.280\n who was sent from the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n2:13:26.280 --> 2:13:29.680\n or the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control,\n\n2:13:29.680 --> 2:13:31.160\n they went down there to collect\n\n2:13:31.160 --> 2:13:34.520\n and they got infected asymptomatically and brought it back?\n\n2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:37.320\n Could it be that they were working on these viruses\n\n2:13:37.320 --> 2:13:40.320\n in the laboratory and there was an issue\n\n2:13:40.320 --> 2:13:41.800\n with waste disposal?\n\n2:13:41.800 --> 2:13:45.120\n And we know that the Wuhan CDC had a major problem\n\n2:13:45.120 --> 2:13:46.680\n with waste disposal.\n\n2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:48.560\n And just before the pandemic,\n\n2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:53.560\n one, they put out an RFP to fix their waste disposal.\n\n2:13:53.720 --> 2:13:58.720\n And in early 2019, they moved to their new site,\n\n2:13:59.120 --> 2:14:00.800\n which was basically across the street\n\n2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:03.920\n from the Huanan Seafood Market.\n\n2:14:03.920 --> 2:14:06.320\n So could there have been issue of somebody infected\n\n2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:08.600\n in the lab of waste disposal?\n\n2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:10.840\n Could a laboratory animal, their experiences\n\n2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:13.200\n in China, actually China just recently passed a law\n\n2:14:13.200 --> 2:14:17.120\n saying it's illegal to sell laboratory animals\n\n2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:19.760\n in the market because there were scientists,\n\n2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:23.160\n or one scientist who was selling laboratory animals\n\n2:14:23.160 --> 2:14:27.280\n in the market and people would just come and buy.\n\n2:14:27.280 --> 2:14:28.120\n It's insane.\n\n2:14:28.120 --> 2:14:31.160\n So there's so many, there are so many scenarios,\n\n2:14:31.160 --> 2:14:35.000\n but if I, again, connect it to my 85% number,\n\n2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:39.880\n I think in the whole category of laboratory related incidents,\n\n2:14:39.880 --> 2:14:42.120\n whether it's collection, waste,\n\n2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:43.800\n something connected to the lab,\n\n2:14:43.800 --> 2:14:46.720\n I think that's the most likely,\n\n2:14:46.720 --> 2:14:49.200\n but there are other credible people\n\n2:14:49.200 --> 2:14:52.040\n who would say they think it's not the most likely\n\n2:14:52.040 --> 2:14:54.080\n and I welcome their views\n\n2:14:54.080 --> 2:14:55.600\n and we need to have this conversation.\n\n2:14:55.600 --> 2:14:59.560\n So in your write up, but what's the URL?\n\n2:14:59.560 --> 2:15:03.640\n Because I always find it by doing Jamie Metzl lab leak.\n\n2:15:03.640 --> 2:15:05.640\n It's probably the easiest, just Google that.\n\n2:15:05.640 --> 2:15:08.120\n No, no, but if you just go to jamiemetzl.com,\n\n2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:11.960\n J A M I E M E T Z L dot com,\n\n2:15:11.960 --> 2:15:15.120\n then they're just a thing, it's COVID origins.\n\n2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:17.000\n It's COVID origins.\n\n2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:19.580\n Or you could just Google Jamie Metzl lab leak.\n\n2:15:21.080 --> 2:15:23.160\n Google search engine is such a powerful thing.\n\n2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:27.440\n You mentioned in that write up that you don't think,\n\n2:15:27.440 --> 2:15:29.080\n this could be just me misreading it\n\n2:15:29.080 --> 2:15:31.240\n or it's just slightly miswritten,\n\n2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:34.720\n but you don't think that the virus\n\n2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:38.120\n is from that 2012 mind, which is fascinating,\n\n2:15:38.120 --> 2:15:40.800\n could be the backbone for SARS COVID too.\n\n2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:43.800\n So what I mean, just the specific virus,\n\n2:15:43.800 --> 2:15:45.920\n which I mentioned, RATG13,\n\n2:15:45.920 --> 2:15:48.120\n and there's a whole history of that\n\n2:15:48.120 --> 2:15:51.360\n because it had a different name and it looked,\n\n2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:54.920\n and Xiaojiang Li provided wrong information\n\n2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:57.200\n about when it had been sequenced.\n\n2:15:57.200 --> 2:16:00.280\n I mean, there was a whole issue connected to that.\n\n2:16:01.360 --> 2:16:02.880\n But the genetic difference,\n\n2:16:02.880 --> 2:16:07.880\n even though it's 96.2% similar to the SARS COVID2 virus,\n\n2:16:10.100 --> 2:16:12.400\n that's actually a significant difference,\n\n2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:17.400\n even though that and a virus called Banal 52\n\n2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:20.200\n that was collected in Laos are the two most similar,\n\n2:16:20.200 --> 2:16:22.320\n there still are differences.\n\n2:16:22.320 --> 2:16:25.720\n So I'm not saying RATG13 is the backbone,\n\n2:16:25.720 --> 2:16:28.780\n but is there, I believe there is a possibility\n\n2:16:28.780 --> 2:16:32.400\n that other viruses that were collected\n\n2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:36.920\n either in that mine in Yunnan in Southern China\n\n2:16:36.920 --> 2:16:39.360\n or in Laos or Cambodia,\n\n2:16:39.360 --> 2:16:42.600\n because that was with the EcoHealth Alliance\n\n2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:45.080\n proposals and documents.\n\n2:16:45.080 --> 2:16:48.680\n Their plan was to collect viruses\n\n2:16:48.680 --> 2:16:51.180\n in Laos and Cambodia and elsewhere\n\n2:16:51.180 --> 2:16:54.260\n and bring them to the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n2:16:54.260 --> 2:16:55.640\n so that there are people.\n\n2:16:55.640 --> 2:16:57.200\n As a matter of fact, just when I was sitting here\n\n2:16:57.200 --> 2:17:01.000\n before this interview,\n\n2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:03.600\n I got a message from somebody who was saying,\n\n2:17:03.600 --> 2:17:06.040\n well, Peter Daszak is telling everybody\n\n2:17:06.040 --> 2:17:10.120\n that the viral sample, the Banal 52 from Laos\n\n2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:13.720\n proves that there's not a lab incident origin\n\n2:17:13.720 --> 2:17:14.560\n of the pandemic.\n\n2:17:14.560 --> 2:17:17.060\n And it actually doesn't prove that at all\n\n2:17:17.060 --> 2:17:20.520\n because these viruses were being collected\n\n2:17:20.520 --> 2:17:24.120\n in places like Laos and Cambodia\n\n2:17:24.120 --> 2:17:28.400\n and being brought to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\n2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:32.800\n Those are like early, early, like the prequel.\n\n2:17:32.800 --> 2:17:35.760\n So these are, they're not sufficiently similar\n\n2:17:35.760 --> 2:17:37.400\n to be a, to serve as a backbone,\n\n2:17:37.400 --> 2:17:38.680\n but they kind of tell a story\n\n2:17:38.680 --> 2:17:40.640\n that they could have been brought to the lab\n\n2:17:40.640 --> 2:17:44.980\n through several processes, including genetic modification\n\n2:17:44.980 --> 2:17:47.560\n or through the natural evolution processes,\n\n2:17:47.560 --> 2:17:49.680\n accelerated evolution, they could have arrived\n\n2:17:49.680 --> 2:17:52.880\n to something that has the spike protein\n\n2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:56.120\n and the cleavage, the foreign cleavage site\n\n2:17:56.120 --> 2:17:56.960\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:17:56.960 --> 2:18:00.200\n So what I'm saying is the essential point\n\n2:18:00.200 --> 2:18:03.440\n is if we had access, if we knew everything\n\n2:18:03.440 --> 2:18:05.960\n that was being, every virus that was being held\n\n2:18:05.960 --> 2:18:09.280\n at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Wuhan CDC,\n\n2:18:09.280 --> 2:18:10.640\n we had full access.\n\n2:18:10.640 --> 2:18:13.840\n We had full access to everybody's lab notes.\n\n2:18:13.840 --> 2:18:16.720\n And we did just the kind of forensic investigation\n\n2:18:16.720 --> 2:18:21.360\n that has been so desperately required since day one.\n\n2:18:21.360 --> 2:18:24.340\n We'd be able to say, well, what did you have?\n\n2:18:24.340 --> 2:18:26.940\n Because if we knew, if it should come out,\n\n2:18:26.940 --> 2:18:30.760\n that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had in its repository,\n\n2:18:30.760 --> 2:18:34.040\n prior to the outbreak, either SARS CoV2\n\n2:18:34.040 --> 2:18:36.640\n or a reasonable precursor to it,\n\n2:18:36.640 --> 2:18:39.480\n that would prove the lab incident hypothesis.\n\n2:18:39.480 --> 2:18:42.920\n In my mind, that's almost certainly why they are preventing\n\n2:18:42.920 --> 2:18:46.140\n any kind of meaningful investigation.\n\n2:18:46.140 --> 2:18:51.140\n So my hypothesis is not that what RITG13 says\n\n2:18:51.840 --> 2:18:54.480\n is because as I mentioned earlier,\n\n2:18:54.480 --> 2:18:58.740\n the genetics of virus are constantly recombinating.\n\n2:18:59.640 --> 2:19:01.880\n So that what that means is if you have,\n\n2:19:01.880 --> 2:19:06.080\n you don't have very many total outlier viruses\n\n2:19:06.080 --> 2:19:08.660\n in a bat community because these viruses\n\n2:19:08.660 --> 2:19:11.240\n are always mixing and matching with each other.\n\n2:19:11.240 --> 2:19:16.080\n And so if you have RITG13, which is relatively similar\n\n2:19:16.080 --> 2:19:19.160\n to SARS CoV2, there's a pretty decent likelihood\n\n2:19:19.160 --> 2:19:22.680\n there was other stuff that was collected\n\n2:19:22.680 --> 2:19:27.680\n at this mine called Mojang Mine in Yunnan Province,\n\n2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:30.940\n maybe in Laos and Cambodia.\n\n2:19:30.940 --> 2:19:34.060\n And that's why we need to have that information.\n\n2:19:36.300 --> 2:19:39.120\n Do you think somebody knows who patient zero is\n\n2:19:39.120 --> 2:19:39.960\n within China?\n\n2:19:39.960 --> 2:19:40.880\n So do you think that is?\n\n2:19:40.880 --> 2:19:42.080\n Well, there's two things.\n\n2:19:42.080 --> 2:19:45.600\n One is I think somebody and people probably know.\n\n2:19:45.600 --> 2:19:47.740\n And then two, it's been incredibly curious\n\n2:19:47.740 --> 2:19:52.400\n that the best virus chasers in the world are in China.\n\n2:19:52.400 --> 2:19:54.520\n And they are in Wuhan.\n\n2:19:54.520 --> 2:19:58.680\n And when we can talk about this deeply compromised,\n\n2:19:58.680 --> 2:20:03.180\n now vastly improved World Health Organization process.\n\n2:20:03.180 --> 2:20:05.440\n But when they went there, the Chinese,\n\n2:20:05.440 --> 2:20:07.440\n the local and national Chinese authorities say,\n\n2:20:07.440 --> 2:20:10.640\n oh, we haven't done, we haven't tested the samples\n\n2:20:10.640 --> 2:20:11.920\n in our blood center.\n\n2:20:11.920 --> 2:20:13.600\n We haven't done any of this tracing.\n\n2:20:13.600 --> 2:20:16.880\n And these deeply compromised people\n\n2:20:16.880 --> 2:20:20.880\n who were part of the international part\n\n2:20:20.880 --> 2:20:25.080\n of the joint study tour, when they came out with their,\n\n2:20:25.080 --> 2:20:26.480\n they had their visit earlier this year\n\n2:20:26.480 --> 2:20:28.100\n and came out with their report.\n\n2:20:28.100 --> 2:20:32.200\n They had in my mind, just an absurd letter\n\n2:20:32.200 --> 2:20:34.180\n to the editor in nature saying,\n\n2:20:34.180 --> 2:20:35.760\n well, if we don't hurry back,\n\n2:20:35.760 --> 2:20:37.480\n we're not gonna know what happened.\n\n2:20:37.480 --> 2:20:41.460\n Assuming that the people in China are like bumpkins\n\n2:20:41.460 --> 2:20:44.080\n who on their own don't know how to trace the origin\n\n2:20:44.080 --> 2:20:47.460\n of a virus and the opposite is the case.\n\n2:20:47.460 --> 2:20:50.000\n So I think there are people in China\n\n2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:51.960\n who at least know a lot.\n\n2:20:51.960 --> 2:20:55.160\n They know a lot more than they're saying.\n\n2:20:55.160 --> 2:20:59.000\n And at the best case scenario is the Chinese government\n\n2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:03.240\n wants to prevent any investigation, including by them.\n\n2:21:03.240 --> 2:21:06.520\n The worst case scenario is that there are people\n\n2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:07.340\n who already know.\n\n2:21:07.340 --> 2:21:10.320\n And that's why, again, my point from day one has been,\n\n2:21:10.320 --> 2:21:14.800\n we need a comprehensive international investigation\n\n2:21:14.800 --> 2:21:18.280\n in Wuhan with full access to all relevant records,\n\n2:21:18.280 --> 2:21:19.360\n samples and personnel.\n\n2:21:19.360 --> 2:21:22.160\n When this, again, deeply flawed.\n\n2:21:22.160 --> 2:21:27.160\n Can I give you a little history of this WHO process?\n\n2:21:27.200 --> 2:21:28.280\n Okay.\n\n2:21:28.280 --> 2:21:30.560\n Who are the, that's funny.\n\n2:21:32.360 --> 2:21:33.520\n Who's on first?\n\n2:21:33.520 --> 2:21:34.440\n Who's on first?\n\n2:21:34.440 --> 2:21:36.400\n I'm so funny with the jokes.\n\n2:21:36.400 --> 2:21:37.240\n Look at me go.\n\n2:21:38.200 --> 2:21:39.760\n Who are the WHO?\n\n2:21:39.760 --> 2:21:41.460\n So what is this organization?\n\n2:21:41.460 --> 2:21:43.080\n What is its purpose?\n\n2:21:43.080 --> 2:21:45.920\n What role did it play in the pandemic?\n\n2:21:45.920 --> 2:21:49.520\n It certainly was demonized in the realm of politics.\n\n2:21:49.520 --> 2:21:54.520\n This is an institution that was supposed to save us\n\n2:21:55.080 --> 2:21:57.080\n from this pandemic.\n\n2:21:57.080 --> 2:21:58.960\n A lot of people believe it failed.\n\n2:21:58.960 --> 2:22:00.280\n Has it failed?\n\n2:22:00.280 --> 2:22:01.680\n Why did it fail?\n\n2:22:01.680 --> 2:22:02.960\n And you said it's improving.\n\n2:22:02.960 --> 2:22:04.280\n How is it improving?\n\n2:22:04.280 --> 2:22:05.120\n Great.\n\n2:22:05.120 --> 2:22:05.940\n All right.\n\n2:22:05.940 --> 2:22:06.780\n I hope you don't mind.\n\n2:22:06.780 --> 2:22:08.840\n I'm gonna have to talk for a little bit of extra time.\n\n2:22:08.840 --> 2:22:09.680\n I love this.\n\n2:22:09.680 --> 2:22:10.520\n I love this.\n\n2:22:10.520 --> 2:22:12.080\n Good, good, good, good.\n\n2:22:12.080 --> 2:22:16.200\n So the WHO is an absolutely essential organization\n\n2:22:16.200 --> 2:22:20.580\n created in 1948 in that wonderful period\n\n2:22:20.580 --> 2:22:22.200\n after the Second World War\n\n2:22:22.200 --> 2:22:24.540\n when the United States and allied countries\n\n2:22:24.540 --> 2:22:27.200\n asked the big bold questions,\n\n2:22:27.200 --> 2:22:30.640\n how do we build a safer world for everyone?\n\n2:22:30.640 --> 2:22:33.340\n And so that's the WHO.\n\n2:22:33.340 --> 2:22:36.780\n If we, although there are many critics of the WHO,\n\n2:22:36.780 --> 2:22:39.120\n if we didn't have it, we would need to invent it\n\n2:22:39.120 --> 2:22:44.120\n because the whole nature of these big public health issues\n\n2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:48.280\n and certainly for pandemics, but all sorts of things\n\n2:22:48.280 --> 2:22:50.880\n is that they are transnational in nature.\n\n2:22:50.880 --> 2:22:54.160\n And so we cannot just build moats.\n\n2:22:54.160 --> 2:22:55.700\n We cannot build walls.\n\n2:22:55.700 --> 2:22:56.960\n We're all connected to it.\n\n2:22:56.960 --> 2:22:59.540\n So that's the idea.\n\n2:22:59.540 --> 2:23:02.760\n There's a political process because the United Nations\n\n2:23:02.760 --> 2:23:04.480\n and the WHO is part of it,\n\n2:23:06.480 --> 2:23:08.840\n it exists within a political context.\n\n2:23:08.840 --> 2:23:11.640\n And so the current director general\n\n2:23:11.640 --> 2:23:13.120\n of the World Health Organization\n\n2:23:13.120 --> 2:23:16.880\n who was just reelected for his second five year term\n\n2:23:16.880 --> 2:23:20.220\n is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus\n\n2:23:20.220 --> 2:23:25.220\n who is from Ethiopia, Tigrayan from Ethiopia.\n\n2:23:25.220 --> 2:23:30.220\n And in full disclosure, I have a lot of respect for Tedros.\n\n2:23:31.100 --> 2:23:33.260\n Tedros got his job.\n\n2:23:33.260 --> 2:23:35.360\n He was not America's candidate.\n\n2:23:35.360 --> 2:23:37.160\n He was not Britain's candidate.\n\n2:23:37.160 --> 2:23:39.920\n Our candidate was a guy named David Nabarro\n\n2:23:39.920 --> 2:23:42.700\n who I also know and have tremendous respect for.\n\n2:23:43.720 --> 2:23:48.720\n China led the process of putting Tedros in this position.\n\n2:23:50.560 --> 2:23:54.520\n And in the earliest days of the pandemic,\n\n2:23:54.520 --> 2:23:55.920\n Tedros, in my view,\n\n2:23:55.920 --> 2:23:57.760\n even though I have tremendous respect for him,\n\n2:23:57.760 --> 2:23:59.280\n I think he made a mistake.\n\n2:23:59.280 --> 2:24:02.240\n The WHO doesn't have its own\n\n2:24:02.240 --> 2:24:04.240\n independent surveillance network.\n\n2:24:04.240 --> 2:24:05.760\n It's not organized to have it\n\n2:24:05.760 --> 2:24:07.200\n and the states have not allowed it.\n\n2:24:07.200 --> 2:24:10.240\n So it's dependent on member states\n\n2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:13.120\n for providing it information.\n\n2:24:13.120 --> 2:24:17.060\n And because it's a poorly funded organization\n\n2:24:17.060 --> 2:24:20.460\n dependent on its bosses who are these governments,\n\n2:24:20.460 --> 2:24:24.680\n it's natural instinct isn't to condemn its bosses.\n\n2:24:24.680 --> 2:24:28.240\n It's to say, well, let's quietly work with everybody.\n\n2:24:28.240 --> 2:24:29.360\n Having said that,\n\n2:24:29.360 --> 2:24:33.280\n the Chinese government knowingly lied to Tedros.\n\n2:24:33.280 --> 2:24:36.360\n And Tedros, in repeating the position\n\n2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:37.200\n of the Chinese government,\n\n2:24:37.200 --> 2:24:39.400\n which incidentally I'll say Donald Trump\n\n2:24:39.400 --> 2:24:41.160\n also did the exact same thing.\n\n2:24:41.160 --> 2:24:43.920\n Donald Trump had a private conversation with Xi Jinping\n\n2:24:43.920 --> 2:24:48.520\n and then repeated what Xi had told him.\n\n2:24:48.520 --> 2:24:50.420\n Both of them were wrong.\n\n2:24:51.400 --> 2:24:55.840\n Dr. Tedros, I think when Chinese government was lying,\n\n2:24:55.840 --> 2:24:56.920\n knowingly lying,\n\n2:24:56.920 --> 2:25:00.000\n saying there's no human to human transmission,\n\n2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:01.100\n Dr. Tedros said that.\n\n2:25:01.100 --> 2:25:04.820\n And even though within the World Health Organization,\n\n2:25:04.820 --> 2:25:07.280\n there were private critiques saying\n\n2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:10.500\n China is now doing exactly what it did in SARS one,\n\n2:25:10.500 --> 2:25:11.920\n it's not providing access,\n\n2:25:11.920 --> 2:25:13.920\n it's not providing information.\n\n2:25:13.920 --> 2:25:16.680\n Tedros's instinct because of his background,\n\n2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:21.000\n because of his role and wrongly,\n\n2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:25.540\n was to have a more collaborative relationship with China,\n\n2:25:25.540 --> 2:25:28.400\n particularly by making assertions\n\n2:25:28.400 --> 2:25:30.360\n based on the information that was wrong.\n\n2:25:30.360 --> 2:25:32.120\n Don't call people liars,\n\n2:25:32.120 --> 2:25:33.840\n they're not gonna be happy with you.\n\n2:25:33.840 --> 2:25:34.680\n They're not gonna be happy.\n\n2:25:34.680 --> 2:25:38.880\n And the job of the WHO isn't to condemn states,\n\n2:25:38.880 --> 2:25:41.920\n it's to do the best possible job of addressing problems.\n\n2:25:41.920 --> 2:25:43.720\n And I think that the culture was,\n\n2:25:43.720 --> 2:25:45.840\n well, let's do the most that we can.\n\n2:25:45.840 --> 2:25:49.260\n If we totally alienate China on day one,\n\n2:25:49.260 --> 2:25:52.600\n we're in even worse shape than if we call them out for.\n\n2:25:52.600 --> 2:25:54.280\n Not exactly sure, by the way,\n\n2:25:54.280 --> 2:25:58.160\n that maybe you can also steel man that argument.\n\n2:25:58.160 --> 2:26:00.520\n Like it's not completely obvious that that's\n\n2:26:00.520 --> 2:26:02.840\n a terrible decision.\n\n2:26:02.840 --> 2:26:05.480\n Like if you and I were in that role,\n\n2:26:05.480 --> 2:26:06.880\n we wouldn't make that decision.\n\n2:26:06.880 --> 2:26:09.240\n It's complicated because like,\n\n2:26:09.240 --> 2:26:11.760\n you want China on your side to help solve this.\n\n2:26:11.760 --> 2:26:14.500\n So I would have made a different decision,\n\n2:26:14.500 --> 2:26:17.560\n which is why I never would have been selected\n\n2:26:17.560 --> 2:26:18.680\n as the director general.\n\n2:26:18.680 --> 2:26:20.640\n There's a selection criteria\n\n2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:24.360\n that everybody kind of needs to support you.\n\n2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:27.120\n And so, but let me just, this is just the beginning.\n\n2:26:27.120 --> 2:26:30.880\n Can you also just elaborate or kind of restate,\n\n2:26:30.880 --> 2:26:34.320\n what were the inaccuracies that you quickly mentioned?\n\n2:26:34.320 --> 2:26:36.720\n So human to human transmission, what were the things?\n\n2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:41.360\n So the most important, there were a few things.\n\n2:26:41.360 --> 2:26:46.360\n One, China didn't report the outbreak.\n\n2:26:46.400 --> 2:26:49.840\n Two, they had the sequenced genome\n\n2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:51.980\n of the SARS CoV2 virus,\n\n2:26:51.980 --> 2:26:55.880\n and they didn't share it for two critical weeks.\n\n2:26:55.880 --> 2:26:59.280\n And when they did share it, it was inadvertent.\n\n2:26:59.280 --> 2:27:01.780\n I mean, there was a very, very courageous scientist\n\n2:27:01.780 --> 2:27:04.800\n who essentially leaked it and was later punished\n\n2:27:04.800 --> 2:27:06.500\n for leaking it, even though the Chinese government\n\n2:27:06.500 --> 2:27:09.640\n is now saying we were so great by releasing the sequenced.\n\n2:27:09.640 --> 2:27:10.840\n Wait, I was really confused.\n\n2:27:10.840 --> 2:27:11.680\n Really?\n\n2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:15.080\n So I'm so clueless about this as most things.\n\n2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:19.340\n Because I thought, because there was a celebration of,\n\n2:27:19.340 --> 2:27:23.480\n isn't this amazing that we got the sequence,\n\n2:27:23.480 --> 2:27:27.200\n that's amazing, and then the scientific community\n\n2:27:27.200 --> 2:27:30.120\n across the world stepped up and were able to do\n\n2:27:30.120 --> 2:27:32.240\n a lot of stuff really quickly with that sharing.\n\n2:27:32.240 --> 2:27:34.500\n Because I thought the Chinese government shared it.\n\n2:27:34.500 --> 2:27:37.000\n No, no, so they sat on it for two weeks.\n\n2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:40.640\n When they shared it against their will, it was incredible.\n\n2:27:40.640 --> 2:27:45.440\n Moderna, 48 hours later after getting the information,\n\n2:27:45.440 --> 2:27:48.200\n getting the sequenced genome, they had the formulation\n\n2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:51.960\n for what's now the Moderna COVID 19 vaccine.\n\n2:27:51.960 --> 2:27:55.240\n But that's two critical weeks.\n\n2:27:55.240 --> 2:27:59.320\n In those early days, they blocked the World Health\n\n2:27:59.320 --> 2:28:03.440\n Organization from sending its experts to Wuhan\n\n2:28:03.440 --> 2:28:04.940\n for more than three weeks.\n\n2:28:04.940 --> 2:28:08.160\n I said they lied about human to human transmission.\n\n2:28:08.160 --> 2:28:11.160\n During that time, they were aggressively enacting\n\n2:28:11.160 --> 2:28:15.880\n their coverup, destroying records, hiding samples,\n\n2:28:15.880 --> 2:28:19.640\n imprisoning people who were asking tough questions.\n\n2:28:19.640 --> 2:28:24.100\n They soon after established their gag order.\n\n2:28:24.100 --> 2:28:27.880\n They fought internally in the World Health Organization\n\n2:28:27.880 --> 2:28:32.080\n to prevent the declaration of a global emergency.\n\n2:28:32.080 --> 2:28:36.120\n So China definitely, I mean, I couldn't be stronger\n\n2:28:36.120 --> 2:28:40.040\n in my critique of China, particularly what it did\n\n2:28:40.040 --> 2:28:42.320\n in those early days, but it really, what it's doing\n\n2:28:42.320 --> 2:28:44.520\n even to today is outrageous.\n\n2:28:44.520 --> 2:28:48.080\n So that was, so then there was the question of,\n\n2:28:48.080 --> 2:28:51.280\n well, how do we examine what actually happened?\n\n2:28:51.280 --> 2:28:54.280\n And the Prime Minister of Australia then and now,\n\n2:28:54.280 --> 2:28:57.000\n Scott Morrison, was incredibly courageous.\n\n2:28:57.000 --> 2:28:59.620\n And he said, we need a full investigation.\n\n2:28:59.620 --> 2:29:02.120\n And because of that, the Chinese government\n\n2:29:02.120 --> 2:29:05.920\n attacked him personally and imposed trade sanctions\n\n2:29:05.920 --> 2:29:09.660\n on Australia to try to, not just to punish Australia,\n\n2:29:09.660 --> 2:29:12.160\n but to deliver a message to every other country.\n\n2:29:12.160 --> 2:29:15.880\n If you ask questions, we're going to punish you ruthlessly.\n\n2:29:15.880 --> 2:29:19.680\n And then that certainly was the message that was delivered.\n\n2:29:21.360 --> 2:29:24.800\n The Australians brought that idea of a full investigation\n\n2:29:24.800 --> 2:29:28.400\n to the World Health Assembly in May of 2020.\n\n2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:32.240\n As I mentioned before, the WHA is the governing authority\n\n2:29:32.240 --> 2:29:36.520\n above, of states above the World Health Organization.\n\n2:29:36.520 --> 2:29:40.600\n And so, but instead of passing a resolution calling\n\n2:29:40.600 --> 2:29:44.560\n for a full investigation, what ended up ironically\n\n2:29:44.560 --> 2:29:48.320\n and tragically passing with Chinese support\n\n2:29:48.320 --> 2:29:50.480\n was a mandate to have essentially\n\n2:29:50.480 --> 2:29:54.040\n a Chinese controlled joint study,\n\n2:29:54.040 --> 2:29:56.640\n where half of the team, a little more than half of the team\n\n2:29:56.640 --> 2:29:59.480\n was Chinese experts, government affiliated Chinese experts,\n\n2:29:59.480 --> 2:30:04.160\n and half were independent international experts\n\n2:30:04.160 --> 2:30:08.360\n but organized by the WHO.\n\n2:30:08.360 --> 2:30:10.080\n And then it took six months\n\n2:30:10.080 --> 2:30:12.400\n to negotiate the terms of reference.\n\n2:30:12.400 --> 2:30:14.960\n And again, while China was doing all this coverup,\n\n2:30:14.960 --> 2:30:16.720\n they delayed and delayed and delayed.\n\n2:30:16.720 --> 2:30:19.480\n And by the terms of reference that were negotiated,\n\n2:30:19.480 --> 2:30:22.960\n China had veto power over who got to be a member\n\n2:30:22.960 --> 2:30:25.840\n of the international group.\n\n2:30:25.840 --> 2:30:30.840\n And that group was not entitled to access to raw data.\n\n2:30:31.160 --> 2:30:34.760\n The Chinese side would give them conclusions\n\n2:30:34.760 --> 2:30:37.640\n based on their own analysis of the raw data,\n\n2:30:37.640 --> 2:30:39.880\n which was totally outrageous.\n\n2:30:39.880 --> 2:30:43.400\n So then, and I was a big, I and others,\n\n2:30:43.400 --> 2:30:46.160\n now friend of mine, although we've never met in person,\n\n2:30:46.160 --> 2:30:48.080\n Gilles de Manouf in New Zealand,\n\n2:30:48.080 --> 2:30:51.560\n he did a great job of chronicling just the letter by letter\n\n2:30:51.560 --> 2:30:53.520\n of the terms of reference.\n\n2:30:54.400 --> 2:30:59.160\n So then it took, now it's the January of this year,\n\n2:30:59.160 --> 2:31:02.480\n January, 2021, this deeply flawed,\n\n2:31:02.480 --> 2:31:07.480\n deeply compromised international group is sent to Wuhan.\n\n2:31:07.480 --> 2:31:09.440\n So what's the connection between this group\n\n2:31:09.440 --> 2:31:10.320\n and the joint study?\n\n2:31:10.320 --> 2:31:12.280\n So the joint study, it had the Chinese side\n\n2:31:12.280 --> 2:31:13.440\n and the international side.\n\n2:31:13.440 --> 2:31:15.480\n So these international experts,\n\n2:31:15.480 --> 2:31:18.200\n then part of their examination was going\n\n2:31:18.200 --> 2:31:19.880\n for one month to Wuhan.\n\n2:31:19.880 --> 2:31:23.240\n And the nature of the flaws of this international group.\n\n2:31:23.240 --> 2:31:24.920\n It's okay, really important point.\n\n2:31:24.920 --> 2:31:26.840\n And I'm sorry, I wasn't clear on that.\n\n2:31:26.840 --> 2:31:31.000\n Rather, the mandate of what they were doing\n\n2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:34.920\n was not to investigate the origins of the pandemic.\n\n2:31:34.920 --> 2:31:37.640\n It was to have a joint study\n\n2:31:37.640 --> 2:31:40.360\n into the zoonotic origins of the virus,\n\n2:31:40.360 --> 2:31:43.680\n which means, which was interpreted to mean\n\n2:31:43.680 --> 2:31:45.600\n the natural origins hypothesis.\n\n2:31:45.600 --> 2:31:48.760\n They weren't empowered for a single hypothesis,\n\n2:31:48.760 --> 2:31:51.240\n not so that they weren't empowered\n\n2:31:51.240 --> 2:31:54.080\n to examine the lab incident origin.\n\n2:31:54.080 --> 2:31:56.960\n They were there to look at the natural origin hypothesis.\n\n2:31:56.960 --> 2:31:58.840\n To shop for some meat at some markets.\n\n2:31:58.840 --> 2:32:03.560\n Yeah, so that was, so then they were there for a month.\n\n2:32:03.560 --> 2:32:04.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:32:04.400 --> 2:32:09.400\n So out of the makeup of the team, guess who was?\n\n2:32:09.680 --> 2:32:12.800\n So the United States government proposed three experts\n\n2:32:12.800 --> 2:32:13.640\n for this team.\n\n2:32:13.640 --> 2:32:15.280\n People who had a lot of background.\n\n2:32:15.280 --> 2:32:17.240\n This was the Trump administration.\n\n2:32:17.240 --> 2:32:19.720\n People who had a lot of background,\n\n2:32:19.720 --> 2:32:23.000\n including in investigating lab incidents.\n\n2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:24.840\n None of those people were accepted.\n\n2:32:24.840 --> 2:32:27.200\n The one American who was accepted.\n\n2:32:27.200 --> 2:32:28.160\n Don't tell me it's Peter Daszak.\n\n2:32:28.160 --> 2:32:29.120\n Peter Daszak.\n\n2:32:29.120 --> 2:32:33.200\n Peter Daszak, who had this funding relationship\n\n2:32:33.200 --> 2:32:35.600\n for many years with the Wuhan Institute of Virology,\n\n2:32:35.600 --> 2:32:39.400\n whose entire basically professional reputation\n\n2:32:39.400 --> 2:32:43.240\n was based on his collaboration with Shujang Li,\n\n2:32:43.240 --> 2:32:47.680\n who had written the February, 2020 Lancet letter\n\n2:32:47.680 --> 2:32:49.520\n saying it comes from natural origin.\n\n2:32:49.520 --> 2:32:51.720\n And anybody who's suggesting otherwise\n\n2:32:51.720 --> 2:32:53.320\n is a conspiracy theorist.\n\n2:32:53.320 --> 2:32:55.280\n And who, at least according to me,\n\n2:32:55.280 --> 2:33:00.200\n had been at very, very least the opposite of transparent\n\n2:33:00.200 --> 2:33:03.400\n and at most engaged in a massive disinformation campaign.\n\n2:33:03.400 --> 2:33:07.800\n He is the one American who's on this.\n\n2:33:07.800 --> 2:33:10.880\n So they go there, they have one month in Wuhan.\n\n2:33:10.880 --> 2:33:14.280\n Two weeks of it are spent in quarantine\n\n2:33:14.280 --> 2:33:15.960\n just in their hotel rooms.\n\n2:33:15.960 --> 2:33:17.560\n So then they have two weeks,\n\n2:33:17.560 --> 2:33:20.120\n but really it's just 10 working days.\n\n2:33:20.120 --> 2:33:22.640\n One of the earliest, and so then they're kind of,\n\n2:33:22.640 --> 2:33:23.640\n we've all seen the pictures.\n\n2:33:23.640 --> 2:33:27.520\n They're traveling around Wuhan in little buses.\n\n2:33:27.520 --> 2:33:30.480\n One of the first visits they have\n\n2:33:30.480 --> 2:33:33.840\n is to this museum exhibition on the,\n\n2:33:33.840 --> 2:33:37.680\n it's basically a propaganda exhibition on the success,\n\n2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:40.320\n Xi Jinping and the success in fighting COVID.\n\n2:33:40.320 --> 2:33:41.960\n And they said, well, we had to show respect\n\n2:33:41.960 --> 2:33:42.800\n to our Chinese hosts.\n\n2:33:42.800 --> 2:33:44.640\n But I think what the Chinese hosts were saying is,\n\n2:33:44.640 --> 2:33:47.200\n let's just, I'm just gonna rub your noses in this.\n\n2:33:47.200 --> 2:33:48.840\n You're gonna go where we tell you.\n\n2:33:48.840 --> 2:33:53.160\n You're gonna hear what we want you to hear.\n\n2:33:53.160 --> 2:33:54.360\n So they have that little short time.\n\n2:33:54.360 --> 2:33:56.240\n They spend a few hours.\n\n2:33:56.240 --> 2:33:59.320\n They weren't in control of where the bus goes.\n\n2:33:59.320 --> 2:34:01.960\n No, I mean, they made recommendations.\n\n2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:05.240\n Many of their recommendations were accepted,\n\n2:34:05.240 --> 2:34:08.800\n but like when they went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\n2:34:08.800 --> 2:34:10.440\n and some of them did,\n\n2:34:10.440 --> 2:34:13.040\n they weren't able to do any kind of audit\n\n2:34:13.040 --> 2:34:15.600\n when they asked for access to raw data.\n\n2:34:15.600 --> 2:34:18.680\n They weren't provided that.\n\n2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:22.600\n They were, it was, as I said in my 60 minutes interview,\n\n2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:24.960\n it was a chaperoned study tour.\n\n2:34:24.960 --> 2:34:27.840\n It was not even remotely close to an investigation.\n\n2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:29.320\n And the thing they were looking at\n\n2:34:29.320 --> 2:34:32.160\n wasn't the origins of the pandemic.\n\n2:34:32.160 --> 2:34:34.680\n It was the single hypothesis\n\n2:34:34.680 --> 2:34:39.000\n of a quote unquote natural origins.\n\n2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:43.200\n Then, I mean, it was really so shocking for me.\n\n2:34:43.200 --> 2:34:46.720\n On February 9 of this year in Wuhan,\n\n2:34:46.720 --> 2:34:51.000\n the Chinese government sets up a joint press event\n\n2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:55.040\n where it's the Chinese side and the international side.\n\n2:34:55.040 --> 2:34:58.000\n And during that press event,\n\n2:34:58.000 --> 2:34:59.880\n a guy named Peter Ben Embarek,\n\n2:34:59.880 --> 2:35:00.800\n and it's a little confusing.\n\n2:35:00.800 --> 2:35:04.160\n He was basically the head of this delegation\n\n2:35:04.160 --> 2:35:06.160\n and he works for the WHO,\n\n2:35:06.160 --> 2:35:09.440\n even though this was an independent committee,\n\n2:35:09.440 --> 2:35:11.720\n it was organized by the WHO.\n\n2:35:11.720 --> 2:35:16.160\n So Peter Ben Embarek gets up there and says,\n\n2:35:16.160 --> 2:35:19.320\n we think it's most likely it comes from nature.\n\n2:35:19.320 --> 2:35:22.080\n Then he says, we think it's possible\n\n2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:23.720\n it comes through frozen food,\n\n2:35:23.720 --> 2:35:25.880\n which is absolutely outrageous.\n\n2:35:25.880 --> 2:35:27.800\n I mean, it's basically preposterous.\n\n2:35:27.800 --> 2:35:32.200\n Alena Chan calls this popsicle origins,\n\n2:35:32.200 --> 2:35:34.360\n but it's really, really unlikely.\n\n2:35:34.360 --> 2:35:36.760\n But then most significantly,\n\n2:35:36.760 --> 2:35:39.960\n he says that we've all agreed\n\n2:35:40.960 --> 2:35:43.360\n that a lab incident origin is quote unquote\n\n2:35:43.360 --> 2:35:47.800\n extremely unlikely and shouldn't be investigated.\n\n2:35:47.800 --> 2:35:50.720\n We later learned that the way they came up\n\n2:35:50.720 --> 2:35:54.480\n with that determination was by a show of hands vote\n\n2:35:54.480 --> 2:35:57.920\n of the international experts and the Chinese experts.\n\n2:35:57.920 --> 2:36:00.600\n And the Chinese experts had to do their vote\n\n2:36:00.600 --> 2:36:03.280\n in front of the Chinese government officials\n\n2:36:03.280 --> 2:36:05.480\n who were constantly there.\n\n2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:07.320\n So even if whatever they thought,\n\n2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:09.800\n there was no possibility that someone raises their hand\n\n2:36:09.800 --> 2:36:12.280\n and say, oh yeah, I think it's a lab origin.\n\n2:36:12.280 --> 2:36:15.200\n So that was outrageous thing number one.\n\n2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:16.480\n Outrageous thing number two,\n\n2:36:16.480 --> 2:36:21.040\n which I mean, I'll come back to my response in February.\n\n2:36:21.040 --> 2:36:24.320\n Outrageous thing number two is months later,\n\n2:36:24.320 --> 2:36:27.960\n Peter Benambarak does an interview on Danish television.\n\n2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:32.560\n And he says, actually I was lying about extremely unlikely\n\n2:36:32.560 --> 2:36:34.320\n because the Chinese side,\n\n2:36:34.320 --> 2:36:38.120\n they didn't want any mention of a lab incident origin\n\n2:36:38.120 --> 2:36:42.480\n anywhere including in the report that later came out.\n\n2:36:42.480 --> 2:36:46.200\n And so the deal we made, even though he himself thought\n\n2:36:46.200 --> 2:36:49.040\n that at least some manifestation of a lab incident origin\n\n2:36:49.040 --> 2:36:53.200\n was likely and that there should be an investigation,\n\n2:36:53.200 --> 2:36:54.800\n particularly he said, well, that's kind of weird\n\n2:36:54.800 --> 2:36:57.280\n that the Wuhan CDC moved just across\n\n2:36:57.280 --> 2:36:59.360\n from the Huanan seafood market\n\n2:36:59.360 --> 2:37:03.920\n just before the beginning of the pandemic.\n\n2:37:03.920 --> 2:37:06.680\n But he said as a horse trading deal\n\n2:37:06.680 --> 2:37:08.480\n with the Chinese authorities,\n\n2:37:08.480 --> 2:37:12.320\n it shouldn't be that he agreed to say\n\n2:37:12.320 --> 2:37:15.280\n it was extremely unlikely and shouldn't be investigated.\n\n2:37:15.280 --> 2:37:18.840\n So I was in actually in Colorado staying with my parents\n\n2:37:18.840 --> 2:37:23.240\n and I stayed up late watching this press event.\n\n2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:25.960\n And I was appalled because I knew after two weeks\n\n2:37:25.960 --> 2:37:29.680\n there was no way they could possibly come to that conclusion.\n\n2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:33.560\n So I immediately sent a private message to Tedros,\n\n2:37:33.560 --> 2:37:37.440\n the WHO director general, essentially saying\n\n2:37:37.440 --> 2:37:40.200\n there's no way they had enough access\n\n2:37:40.200 --> 2:37:42.440\n to come to this conclusion.\n\n2:37:42.440 --> 2:37:47.280\n If the WHO doesn't distance itself from this,\n\n2:37:47.280 --> 2:37:49.880\n the WHO itself is going to be in danger\n\n2:37:49.880 --> 2:37:53.160\n because it's going to be basically institutional capture\n\n2:37:53.160 --> 2:37:54.000\n by the Chinese.\n\n2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:56.400\n This was repeating the Chinese government's\n\n2:37:56.400 --> 2:37:57.640\n propaganda points.\n\n2:37:57.640 --> 2:38:00.760\n And Tedros sent me a really, again,\n\n2:38:00.760 --> 2:38:02.080\n why I have so much respect for Tedros,\n\n2:38:02.080 --> 2:38:04.320\n sent me a private note saying,\n\n2:38:04.320 --> 2:38:08.440\n don't worry, we are determined to do the right thing.\n\n2:38:08.440 --> 2:38:10.000\n And so I got that private message.\n\n2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:11.880\n And again, I really like Tedros,\n\n2:38:11.880 --> 2:38:14.760\n but I thought, well, what are you gonna do?\n\n2:38:14.760 --> 2:38:19.120\n Three days later, Tedros makes a public statement.\n\n2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:23.000\n And he says, I've heard this thing.\n\n2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:25.400\n I don't think that this is a final answer.\n\n2:38:25.400 --> 2:38:29.320\n We need to have a full investigation into this process.\n\n2:38:29.320 --> 2:38:32.800\n He then released two more statements\n\n2:38:32.800 --> 2:38:37.280\n saying we need to have a full investigation\n\n2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:38.520\n with access to raw data.\n\n2:38:38.520 --> 2:38:42.840\n And we need a full audit of the Wuhan labs.\n\n2:38:42.840 --> 2:38:46.360\n So then that part was really, really great.\n\n2:38:46.360 --> 2:38:49.200\n But then this saga continues because,\n\n2:38:49.200 --> 2:38:51.760\n so I was part of a group, as I mentioned before,\n\n2:38:51.760 --> 2:38:53.480\n this Paris group.\n\n2:38:53.480 --> 2:38:55.600\n It was about two dozen or so experts.\n\n2:38:55.600 --> 2:39:00.000\n And we'd been meeting since 2020 and having regular meetings.\n\n2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:02.200\n And we just present papers, present data,\n\n2:39:02.200 --> 2:39:04.440\n debate to try to really get to the bottom of things.\n\n2:39:04.440 --> 2:39:06.320\n And it was all private.\n\n2:39:06.320 --> 2:39:09.160\n So I went to this group and I said, look,\n\n2:39:09.160 --> 2:39:12.880\n this playing field is now skewed.\n\n2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:14.920\n These guys, they've put out this thing,\n\n2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:16.840\n lab incident origin, extremely unlikely.\n\n2:39:16.840 --> 2:39:19.560\n It's in every newspaper in the world.\n\n2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:21.880\n We can't just be our own little private group\n\n2:39:21.880 --> 2:39:23.400\n talking to each other.\n\n2:39:23.400 --> 2:39:26.800\n So I led the political process of drafting\n\n2:39:26.800 --> 2:39:31.360\n what became four open letters that many of us signed,\n\n2:39:31.360 --> 2:39:35.000\n most of us signed, that saying, all right,\n\n2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:41.040\n here's why this study group and the report are not credible.\n\n2:39:41.040 --> 2:39:42.400\n Here's what's wrong.\n\n2:39:42.400 --> 2:39:45.840\n Here's what a full investigation would look like.\n\n2:39:45.840 --> 2:39:48.360\n Here's a treasure map of all the resources\n\n2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:50.480\n where people can look.\n\n2:39:50.480 --> 2:39:52.800\n And we demand a comprehensive investigation.\n\n2:39:52.800 --> 2:39:56.240\n So those four open letters were in pretty much\n\n2:39:56.240 --> 2:39:58.520\n every newspaper in the world.\n\n2:39:58.520 --> 2:40:00.920\n And it played a really significant role\n\n2:40:00.920 --> 2:40:02.640\n along with some other things.\n\n2:40:02.640 --> 2:40:05.920\n There was later, there was a letter, a short letter\n\n2:40:05.920 --> 2:40:10.360\n in Science making basically similar points\n\n2:40:10.360 --> 2:40:11.760\n in a much more condensed way.\n\n2:40:11.760 --> 2:40:14.600\n There were some higher profile articles\n\n2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:19.720\n by Nicholas Wade and Nick Baker and others.\n\n2:40:19.720 --> 2:40:24.440\n And those collectively shifted the conversation.\n\n2:40:24.440 --> 2:40:29.320\n And then really impressively, the WHO,\n\n2:40:29.320 --> 2:40:30.880\n and with Tedros's leadership, did\n\n2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:33.520\n something that was really incredible.\n\n2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:36.680\n And that is earlier this year, they,\n\n2:40:36.680 --> 2:40:39.520\n meaning the leadership of the WHO, not the World Health\n\n2:40:39.520 --> 2:40:43.400\n Assembly, but the leadership of the WHO,\n\n2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:45.600\n announced the establishment of what's\n\n2:40:45.600 --> 2:40:49.480\n called SAGO, the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins\n\n2:40:49.480 --> 2:40:51.360\n of Novel Pathogens.\n\n2:40:51.360 --> 2:40:55.560\n And basically what they did was overrule their own governing\n\n2:40:55.560 --> 2:40:59.240\n board and say, we're going to create our own entity.\n\n2:40:59.240 --> 2:41:03.120\n So it basically dissolved that international, deeply flawed\n\n2:41:03.120 --> 2:41:04.440\n international joint study group.\n\n2:41:04.440 --> 2:41:07.920\n And a lot of those people, they have become very critical,\n\n2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:11.040\n like the Chinese of Tedros.\n\n2:41:11.040 --> 2:41:15.200\n So then they had an open call for nominations\n\n2:41:15.200 --> 2:41:17.520\n to be part of SAGO.\n\n2:41:17.520 --> 2:41:23.080\n And so a lot of people put in their nominations.\n\n2:41:23.080 --> 2:41:25.440\n They selected 26 people.\n\n2:41:25.440 --> 2:41:27.360\n But our group, we had a meeting, and we\n\n2:41:27.360 --> 2:41:30.800\n were unhappy with that list of 26.\n\n2:41:30.800 --> 2:41:35.200\n It still felt skewed toward the natural origin hypothesis.\n\n2:41:35.200 --> 2:41:38.440\n So again, I drafted, and we worked on together,\n\n2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:42.640\n an open letter which we submitted to the WHO saying,\n\n2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:45.200\n we think this list, it's a step in the right direction,\n\n2:41:45.200 --> 2:41:46.680\n but it's not good enough.\n\n2:41:46.680 --> 2:41:50.600\n And we call on these three people to be removed,\n\n2:41:50.600 --> 2:41:53.920\n and we have these three people who we think should be added.\n\n2:41:53.920 --> 2:41:56.560\n Incredibly, and I was in private touch\n\n2:41:56.560 --> 2:42:00.280\n with the WHO, after announcing the 26 people,\n\n2:42:00.280 --> 2:42:04.840\n the WHO said, we're reopening the process, so send in more.\n\n2:42:04.840 --> 2:42:08.600\n And so then they added two more people, one of whom\n\n2:42:08.600 --> 2:42:13.840\n is an expert in the auditing of lab incidents.\n\n2:42:13.840 --> 2:42:17.040\n And then one of the, so they added those two.\n\n2:42:17.040 --> 2:42:20.280\n And then when they just released the list of people\n\n2:42:20.280 --> 2:42:23.120\n who are part of SAGO, this one woman,\n\n2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:26.760\n a highly respected Dutch virologist named Marion Koopmans,\n\n2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:30.840\n who had been part of that deeply flawed and compromised\n\n2:42:30.840 --> 2:42:33.960\n international study group, who had called,\n\n2:42:33.960 --> 2:42:36.680\n who has consistently called a lab incident origin, quote,\n\n2:42:36.680 --> 2:42:39.320\n unquote, a debunked conspiracy theory.\n\n2:42:39.320 --> 2:42:42.720\n As of now, her name is not on the list.\n\n2:42:42.720 --> 2:42:44.760\n We haven't seen any announcements.\n\n2:42:44.760 --> 2:42:48.040\n So I summary, and I'm sorry to go on for so long\n\n2:42:48.040 --> 2:42:49.520\n and to be so animated about this,\n\n2:42:49.520 --> 2:42:55.640\n I genuinely feel that the WHO is trying to do the right thing.\n\n2:42:55.640 --> 2:42:59.440\n But they exist within a political context.\n\n2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:03.680\n And they're pushing at the edges,\n\n2:43:03.680 --> 2:43:07.520\n but there's only so far that they can go.\n\n2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:10.080\n And that's why we definitely need\n\n2:43:10.080 --> 2:43:12.440\n to have full accountability for the WHO.\n\n2:43:12.440 --> 2:43:14.800\n We need to expand the mandate to WHO.\n\n2:43:14.800 --> 2:43:18.080\n But we need to recognize that states have a big role.\n\n2:43:18.080 --> 2:43:21.440\n And China is an incredibly influential state\n\n2:43:21.440 --> 2:43:24.560\n that's doing everything possible to prevent\n\n2:43:24.560 --> 2:43:27.320\n the kind of full investigation into pandemic origins\n\n2:43:27.320 --> 2:43:28.800\n that's so desperately required.\n\n2:43:28.800 --> 2:43:31.080\n Well, it sounds like the leadership\n\n2:43:31.080 --> 2:43:34.160\n made all the difference in the WHO.\n\n2:43:34.160 --> 2:43:37.120\n So like the way to change the momentum of large institutions\n\n2:43:37.120 --> 2:43:38.840\n is through the leadership.\n\n2:43:38.840 --> 2:43:42.560\n Leadership and empowerment, as I mentioned,\n\n2:43:42.560 --> 2:43:45.040\n the World Health Assembly is meeting now.\n\n2:43:45.040 --> 2:43:50.720\n And I think that it shouldn't be that we require superhumans.\n\n2:43:50.720 --> 2:43:53.720\n And there are some people who are big critics of WHO.\n\n2:43:53.720 --> 2:44:00.440\n The leader of the WHO in SARS 1 was definitely more aggressive.\n\n2:44:00.440 --> 2:44:05.520\n She had a different set of powers at that time.\n\n2:44:05.520 --> 2:44:08.920\n But it can't be entirely, we definitely\n\n2:44:08.920 --> 2:44:12.560\n need strong willed, aggressive, independent people\n\n2:44:12.560 --> 2:44:14.480\n in these kinds of roles.\n\n2:44:14.480 --> 2:44:17.840\n We also need a more empowered WHO.\n\n2:44:17.840 --> 2:44:20.520\n Like when the Chinese government in the earliest days\n\n2:44:20.520 --> 2:44:23.360\n of the pandemic said, we're just not\n\n2:44:23.360 --> 2:44:26.120\n going to allow you to send a team to collect\n\n2:44:26.120 --> 2:44:27.000\n your own information.\n\n2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:30.760\n And we're not going to allow you to have\n\n2:44:30.760 --> 2:44:34.120\n any kind of independent surveillance,\n\n2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:38.280\n there was very little that the WHO could do because\n\n2:44:38.280 --> 2:44:40.600\n of the limitations of its mandate.\n\n2:44:40.600 --> 2:44:44.040\n And we can't just say we're going to have a WHO that only\n\n2:44:44.040 --> 2:44:46.240\n compromises Chinese sovereignty.\n\n2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:48.520\n If we want to have a powerful WHO,\n\n2:44:48.520 --> 2:44:54.440\n we should say we have emergency teams when the director\n\n2:44:54.440 --> 2:44:57.720\n general says an emergency team needs to go somewhere.\n\n2:44:57.720 --> 2:45:00.440\n If they aren't allowed to go there that day,\n\n2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:02.480\n you could say there's an immediate referral\n\n2:45:02.480 --> 2:45:03.640\n to the Security Council.\n\n2:45:03.640 --> 2:45:05.760\n There needs to be something.\n\n2:45:05.760 --> 2:45:09.160\n But we have all these demands, rightfully,\n\n2:45:09.160 --> 2:45:13.240\n so of the WHO, which doesn't have the authorities.\n\n2:45:13.240 --> 2:45:16.240\n The WHO itself only controls 20% of its own budget.\n\n2:45:16.240 --> 2:45:17.680\n So the governments are saying, we're\n\n2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:21.640\n going to give you money to do this or that.\n\n2:45:21.640 --> 2:45:27.160\n So we need a stronger WHO to protect us,\n\n2:45:27.160 --> 2:45:28.920\n but we also have to build that.\n\n2:45:28.920 --> 2:45:33.000\n So looking a little bit into the future,\n\n2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:35.080\n let's first step into the past, sort\n\n2:45:35.080 --> 2:45:39.640\n of the philosophical question about China.\n\n2:45:39.640 --> 2:45:43.520\n If you were to put yourself in the shoes of the Chinese\n\n2:45:43.520 --> 2:45:49.400\n government, if they were to be more transparent,\n\n2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:51.520\n how should they be more transparent?\n\n2:45:51.520 --> 2:45:57.720\n Because it's easier to say, we want to see this.\n\n2:45:57.720 --> 2:45:59.280\n But from a perspective of government,\n\n2:45:59.280 --> 2:46:00.720\n and not just the Chinese government,\n\n2:46:00.720 --> 2:46:07.880\n but a government on WHO's geographic territory,\n\n2:46:07.880 --> 2:46:11.280\n say it's a lab leak, a lab leak occurred\n\n2:46:11.280 --> 2:46:16.200\n that has resulted in trillions of dollars of loss,\n\n2:46:16.200 --> 2:46:20.760\n countless of lives, just all kinds of damage to the world.\n\n2:46:24.120 --> 2:46:27.760\n If they were to admit or show data\n\n2:46:27.760 --> 2:46:31.200\n that could serve as evidence for a lab leak,\n\n2:46:31.200 --> 2:46:35.720\n that's something that people could, in the worst case,\n\n2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:41.200\n start wars over, or in the most likely case,\n\n2:46:41.200 --> 2:46:45.960\n just constantly bring that up at every turn,\n\n2:46:45.960 --> 2:46:50.280\n making you powerless in negotiations.\n\n2:46:50.280 --> 2:46:51.880\n Whenever you want to do something\n\n2:46:51.880 --> 2:46:54.880\n in geopolitical sense, the United States\n\n2:46:54.880 --> 2:46:57.120\n will bring up, oh, remember that time\n\n2:46:57.120 --> 2:47:01.480\n you cost us trillions of dollars because of your fuck up?\n\n2:47:01.480 --> 2:47:05.440\n So what is the incentive for the Chinese government\n\n2:47:05.440 --> 2:47:07.400\n to be transparent?\n\n2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:11.520\n And if it is to be transparent, how should it do it?\n\n2:47:11.520 --> 2:47:14.160\n So there's a bunch of people.\n\n2:47:14.160 --> 2:47:17.040\n The reason I'm talking to you, as opposed\n\n2:47:17.040 --> 2:47:19.960\n to a bunch of other folks, because you\n\n2:47:19.960 --> 2:47:22.800\n are kindhearted and thoughtful and open minded\n\n2:47:22.800 --> 2:47:24.520\n and really respected.\n\n2:47:24.520 --> 2:47:27.520\n There's a bunch of people that are talking about lab leak\n\n2:47:27.520 --> 2:47:31.480\n that are a little bit less interested in building\n\n2:47:31.480 --> 2:47:34.840\n a better world and more interested in pointing out\n\n2:47:34.840 --> 2:47:36.160\n the emperor has no clothes.\n\n2:47:36.160 --> 2:47:40.480\n They want step one, which is saying, basically,\n\n2:47:40.480 --> 2:47:43.560\n tearing down the bullshitters.\n\n2:47:43.560 --> 2:47:48.360\n They don't want to do the further steps of building.\n\n2:47:48.360 --> 2:47:50.520\n And so as the Chinese government,\n\n2:47:50.520 --> 2:47:53.960\n I would be nervous about being transparent with anybody that\n\n2:47:53.960 --> 2:47:58.280\n just wants to tear our power centers, our power\n\n2:47:58.280 --> 2:47:59.120\n structures down.\n\n2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:01.600\n Anyway, that's a long way to ask,\n\n2:48:01.600 --> 2:48:06.320\n how should the Chinese government be transparent now\n\n2:48:06.320 --> 2:48:08.480\n and in the future?\n\n2:48:08.480 --> 2:48:12.200\n So maybe I'll break that down into a few sub questions.\n\n2:48:12.200 --> 2:48:15.760\n The first is, what should, in an ideal world,\n\n2:48:15.760 --> 2:48:17.560\n what should the Chinese government do?\n\n2:48:17.560 --> 2:48:20.120\n And that's pretty straightforward.\n\n2:48:20.120 --> 2:48:22.600\n They should be totally transparent.\n\n2:48:22.600 --> 2:48:24.600\n The South African government now,\n\n2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:27.880\n there is an outbreak of this Omicron variant.\n\n2:48:27.880 --> 2:48:31.120\n And the South African government has done what we would want.\n\n2:48:31.120 --> 2:48:33.240\n A government to do is say, hey, there's an outbreak.\n\n2:48:33.240 --> 2:48:35.600\n We don't have all of the information.\n\n2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:36.520\n We need help.\n\n2:48:36.520 --> 2:48:38.520\n We want to alert the world.\n\n2:48:38.520 --> 2:48:41.000\n And in some ways, they're being punished for it\n\n2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:42.040\n through these travel bans.\n\n2:48:42.040 --> 2:48:43.680\n But it's a separate topic.\n\n2:48:43.680 --> 2:48:46.480\n But I actually think short term travel bans actually\n\n2:48:46.480 --> 2:48:49.040\n are not a terrible idea.\n\n2:48:49.040 --> 2:48:51.960\n They should have, on day one, they\n\n2:48:51.960 --> 2:48:55.000\n should have allowed WHO experts in.\n\n2:48:55.000 --> 2:48:57.200\n They should have shared information.\n\n2:48:57.200 --> 2:49:00.200\n They should have allowed a full and comprehensive\n\n2:49:00.200 --> 2:49:04.240\n investigation with international partnerships\n\n2:49:04.240 --> 2:49:07.920\n to understand what went wrong.\n\n2:49:07.920 --> 2:49:10.560\n They should have shared their raw data.\n\n2:49:10.560 --> 2:49:12.880\n They should have allowed their scientists\n\n2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:14.720\n to speak and write publicly.\n\n2:49:14.720 --> 2:49:17.040\n Because nobody knows more about this stuff,\n\n2:49:17.040 --> 2:49:20.560\n certainly in the early days, than their scientists do.\n\n2:49:20.560 --> 2:49:26.480\n So it's relatively easy to say what they should do.\n\n2:49:26.480 --> 2:49:29.520\n It's a hard question to say, well, what would happen?\n\n2:49:29.520 --> 2:49:35.240\n Let's just say tomorrow, we prove for certain\n\n2:49:35.240 --> 2:49:38.640\n that this pandemic stems both from an accidental lab\n\n2:49:38.640 --> 2:49:40.960\n incident and then from what I've consistently\n\n2:49:40.960 --> 2:49:42.880\n called a criminal cover up.\n\n2:49:42.880 --> 2:49:46.280\n Because the cover up has done, in many ways,\n\n2:49:46.280 --> 2:49:49.880\n as much or more damage than the incident.\n\n2:49:49.880 --> 2:49:50.840\n Well, what happens?\n\n2:49:50.840 --> 2:49:54.120\n You could easily imagine Xi Jinping has had two terms\n\n2:49:54.120 --> 2:49:57.760\n as the leader of China.\n\n2:49:57.760 --> 2:49:59.920\n And he can now have unlimited terms.\n\n2:49:59.920 --> 2:50:01.920\n Well, they've changed the rules for that.\n\n2:50:01.920 --> 2:50:03.600\n But he's got a lot of enemies.\n\n2:50:03.600 --> 2:50:06.040\n I mean, there are a lot of people who are waiting in line\n\n2:50:06.040 --> 2:50:07.680\n to step up.\n\n2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:11.200\n So is there a chance that Xi Jinping could be deposed\n\n2:50:11.200 --> 2:50:13.240\n if it was proven that this comes from a lab?\n\n2:50:13.240 --> 2:50:15.520\n And I think there's a real possibility.\n\n2:50:15.520 --> 2:50:19.400\n Would people in the United States Congress, for example,\n\n2:50:19.400 --> 2:50:21.920\n demand reparations from China?\n\n2:50:21.920 --> 2:50:26.280\n So we've had $4.5 trillion of stimulus,\n\n2:50:26.280 --> 2:50:29.840\n all of the economic losses, and we owe a lot of money\n\n2:50:29.840 --> 2:50:32.960\n to China from our debt.\n\n2:50:32.960 --> 2:50:35.520\n I'm quite certain that members of Congress\n\n2:50:35.520 --> 2:50:37.640\n would say, we're just going to wipe that out.\n\n2:50:37.640 --> 2:50:39.880\n It would destroy the global financial system,\n\n2:50:39.880 --> 2:50:42.320\n but I think they would be extremely likely.\n\n2:50:42.320 --> 2:50:44.400\n Would other countries, like India,\n\n2:50:44.400 --> 2:50:47.760\n that have lost millions of people\n\n2:50:47.760 --> 2:50:50.680\n and had terrible economic damages,\n\n2:50:50.680 --> 2:50:53.360\n would they demand reparations?\n\n2:50:53.360 --> 2:50:55.760\n So I think from a Chinese perspective,\n\n2:50:55.760 --> 2:50:58.120\n starting from now, it would have\n\n2:50:58.120 --> 2:51:00.560\n major geopolitical implications.\n\n2:51:00.560 --> 2:51:03.600\n And go back to Chernobyl, there was\n\n2:51:03.600 --> 2:51:06.800\n a reason why the Soviet Union went to such length\n\n2:51:06.800 --> 2:51:08.280\n to cover things up.\n\n2:51:08.280 --> 2:51:11.520\n And when it came out, I mean, there are different theories,\n\n2:51:11.520 --> 2:51:15.840\n but certainly Chernobyl played some role\n\n2:51:15.840 --> 2:51:21.280\n in the end of communist power in the Soviet Union.\n\n2:51:21.280 --> 2:51:25.320\n So the Chinese are very, very aware of that.\n\n2:51:25.320 --> 2:51:27.360\n But the difference, of course, with Chernobyl,\n\n2:51:27.360 --> 2:51:28.680\n the damage to the rest of the world\n\n2:51:28.680 --> 2:51:32.040\n was not nearly as significant as it was with COVID.\n\n2:51:32.040 --> 2:51:34.520\n So you say that the coverup is a crime,\n\n2:51:34.520 --> 2:51:37.720\n but everything you just described,\n\n2:51:37.720 --> 2:51:40.800\n the response of the rest of the world,\n\n2:51:40.800 --> 2:51:44.040\n is, I could say, unfair.\n\n2:51:45.040 --> 2:51:46.320\n Well, it's not...\n\n2:51:46.320 --> 2:51:50.640\n So, okay, if we say the best possible version of the story,\n\n2:51:50.640 --> 2:51:55.400\n you know, lab leaks happen, they shouldn't happen,\n\n2:51:55.400 --> 2:51:57.760\n but they happen.\n\n2:51:57.760 --> 2:52:01.080\n And how is that on the Chinese government?\n\n2:52:02.280 --> 2:52:04.000\n I mean, what's a good example?\n\n2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:05.040\n Well, the Union Carbide.\n\n2:52:05.040 --> 2:52:07.440\n Union Carbide, there was this American company\n\n2:52:07.440 --> 2:52:10.280\n operating in India, they had this leak,\n\n2:52:10.280 --> 2:52:12.600\n all these people were killed.\n\n2:52:12.600 --> 2:52:15.080\n The company admitted responsibility.\n\n2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:17.480\n I was working in the White House\n\n2:52:17.480 --> 2:52:19.480\n when the United States government, in my view,\n\n2:52:19.480 --> 2:52:20.960\n which I know to be the case,\n\n2:52:20.960 --> 2:52:23.440\n but other people in China think differently,\n\n2:52:23.440 --> 2:52:25.480\n bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.\n\n2:52:25.480 --> 2:52:27.720\n And so the United States government\n\n2:52:27.720 --> 2:52:29.560\n allowed a full investigation,\n\n2:52:29.560 --> 2:52:34.280\n then we paid reparations to the families.\n\n2:52:34.280 --> 2:52:36.880\n And so to your question, if I were,\n\n2:52:36.880 --> 2:52:39.600\n let's just say I were the Chinese government,\n\n2:52:39.600 --> 2:52:42.080\n not, I mean, kind of an idealized version\n\n2:52:42.080 --> 2:52:43.760\n of the Chinese government.\n\n2:52:43.760 --> 2:52:46.960\n And let's just say that they had come to the conclusion\n\n2:52:46.960 --> 2:52:49.000\n that it was a lab incident.\n\n2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:52.800\n And let's just say they knew that even if\n\n2:52:52.800 --> 2:52:55.080\n they continued to cover it up,\n\n2:52:55.080 --> 2:52:58.640\n eventually this information would come out.\n\n2:52:58.640 --> 2:53:00.160\n I mean, maybe there was a whistleblower,\n\n2:53:00.160 --> 2:53:01.960\n maybe they knew of some evidence\n\n2:53:01.960 --> 2:53:05.240\n that we didn't know about or something.\n\n2:53:05.240 --> 2:53:07.660\n What would I do starting right now?\n\n2:53:09.160 --> 2:53:12.560\n What I would do is I would hold a press conference\n\n2:53:12.560 --> 2:53:16.840\n and I would say, we had this terrible accident.\n\n2:53:16.840 --> 2:53:19.520\n The reason why we were doing this research\n\n2:53:19.520 --> 2:53:23.320\n in Wuhan and elsewhere is that we had SARS one\n\n2:53:23.320 --> 2:53:26.400\n and we felt a responsibility to do everything possible\n\n2:53:26.400 --> 2:53:29.400\n to prevent that kind of terrible thing happening again\n\n2:53:29.400 --> 2:53:31.480\n for our country and for the world.\n\n2:53:31.480 --> 2:53:34.480\n That was why we collaborated with France,\n\n2:53:34.480 --> 2:53:38.400\n with the United States in building up those capacities.\n\n2:53:38.400 --> 2:53:40.480\n We know that nothing is perfect,\n\n2:53:40.480 --> 2:53:42.800\n but we're a sovereign country and we have our own system.\n\n2:53:42.800 --> 2:53:45.720\n And so we had to adapt our systems\n\n2:53:45.720 --> 2:53:49.400\n so that they made sense internally.\n\n2:53:49.400 --> 2:53:53.960\n When this outbreak began, we didn't know how it started.\n\n2:53:53.960 --> 2:53:57.680\n And that was why we wanted to look into things.\n\n2:53:57.680 --> 2:54:01.400\n When the process of investigating became so political,\n\n2:54:01.400 --> 2:54:04.680\n it gave us pause and we were worried that our enemies\n\n2:54:04.680 --> 2:54:07.440\n were trying to use this investigation\n\n2:54:07.440 --> 2:54:09.520\n in order to undermine us.\n\n2:54:09.520 --> 2:54:13.680\n Having said that, now that we've dug deeper,\n\n2:54:13.680 --> 2:54:16.640\n we have recognized because we have access\n\n2:54:16.640 --> 2:54:19.480\n to additional information that we didn't have then,\n\n2:54:19.480 --> 2:54:23.520\n that this pandemic started from an accidental lab incident.\n\n2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:25.800\n And we feel really terribly about that.\n\n2:54:25.800 --> 2:54:28.440\n And we know that we were very aggressive\n\n2:54:28.440 --> 2:54:31.040\n in covering up information in the beginning,\n\n2:54:31.040 --> 2:54:34.320\n but the reason we were doing that is because we thoroughly,\n\n2:54:34.320 --> 2:54:37.600\n we fully believe that it came from a natural origin.\n\n2:54:37.600 --> 2:54:41.280\n Now that we see otherwise, we feel terribly.\n\n2:54:41.280 --> 2:54:44.880\n Therefore, we're doing a few different things.\n\n2:54:44.880 --> 2:54:48.160\n One is we are committing ourselves\n\n2:54:48.160 --> 2:54:53.160\n to establishing a stronger WHO, a new pandemic treaty\n\n2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:57.800\n that addresses the major challenges that we face\n\n2:54:57.800 --> 2:55:00.960\n and allows the World Health Organization\n\n2:55:00.960 --> 2:55:03.680\n to pierce the veil of absolute sovereignty\n\n2:55:03.680 --> 2:55:06.840\n because we know that when these pandemics happen,\n\n2:55:06.840 --> 2:55:08.680\n they affect everybody.\n\n2:55:08.680 --> 2:55:11.920\n We are also putting, and you can pick your number,\n\n2:55:11.920 --> 2:55:15.280\n but let's start with five trillion US dollars,\n\n2:55:15.280 --> 2:55:19.560\n some massive amount, into a fund\n\n2:55:19.560 --> 2:55:24.480\n that we will be distributing to the victims of COVID 19\n\n2:55:24.480 --> 2:55:26.040\n and their, and their.\n\n2:55:26.040 --> 2:55:27.560\n China would do that?\n\n2:55:27.560 --> 2:55:29.440\n This is a fantasy speech.\n\n2:55:29.440 --> 2:55:31.840\n But I disagree with your, I mean, okay.\n\n2:55:34.160 --> 2:55:36.880\n So you think China has a responsibility?\n\n2:55:36.880 --> 2:55:40.480\n Well, so it's not the, like just a lab leak.\n\n2:55:40.480 --> 2:55:45.120\n Like if China on day one had said we have this outbreak,\n\n2:55:45.120 --> 2:55:47.080\n we don't know where it came from,\n\n2:55:47.080 --> 2:55:50.120\n we want to have a full investigation,\n\n2:55:50.120 --> 2:55:52.120\n we call on international,\n\n2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:53.840\n responsible international partners\n\n2:55:53.840 --> 2:55:55.640\n to join us in that process,\n\n2:55:55.640 --> 2:55:58.000\n and we're going to do everything in our power\n\n2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:00.360\n to share the relevant information\n\n2:56:00.360 --> 2:56:03.200\n because however this started, we're all victims.\n\n2:56:03.200 --> 2:56:05.120\n That's a totally different story\n\n2:56:05.120 --> 2:56:08.840\n than punishing Australia, preventing the WHO,\n\n2:56:08.840 --> 2:56:10.640\n blocking any investigation,\n\n2:56:10.640 --> 2:56:13.920\n condemning people who are trying to look, and so that's.\n\n2:56:13.920 --> 2:56:16.880\n So cover up for a couple weeks,\n\n2:56:16.880 --> 2:56:18.600\n you can understand maybe,\n\n2:56:18.600 --> 2:56:20.480\n because there's so much uncertainty.\n\n2:56:20.480 --> 2:56:24.600\n You're like, oh, let's hide all the Winnie the Pooh pictures\n\n2:56:24.600 --> 2:56:26.040\n while we figure this out.\n\n2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:28.800\n But the moment you really figure out what happened,\n\n2:56:30.320 --> 2:56:32.320\n you always, as a Jew I can say this,\n\n2:56:32.320 --> 2:56:35.280\n always find like a blame the Jews kind of situation\n\n2:56:35.280 --> 2:56:36.600\n a little bit, just a little bit.\n\n2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:38.440\n Be like, all right, it's not us.\n\n2:56:38.440 --> 2:56:41.000\n I'm just kidding.\n\n2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:44.680\n But be proactive in saying.\n\n2:56:44.680 --> 2:56:47.640\n Just to start here, but the joke about that is\n\n2:56:47.640 --> 2:56:50.120\n there's a big problem because a lot of people\n\n2:56:50.120 --> 2:56:53.080\n have to leave the Jewish socialist conspiracy\n\n2:56:53.080 --> 2:56:56.080\n to make it for the Jewish capitalist conspiracy meeting.\n\n2:56:56.080 --> 2:56:56.920\n I love it.\n\n2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:01.680\n So I would say not five trillion,\n\n2:57:01.680 --> 2:57:03.440\n but some large amount,\n\n2:57:03.440 --> 2:57:05.200\n and I would really focus on the future,\n\n2:57:05.200 --> 2:57:08.000\n which is every time we talk about the lab leak,\n\n2:57:09.280 --> 2:57:11.760\n the unfortunate thing is I feel like people\n\n2:57:11.760 --> 2:57:13.360\n don't focus enough about the future.\n\n2:57:13.360 --> 2:57:15.080\n To me, the lab leak is important\n\n2:57:16.200 --> 2:57:20.200\n because we want to construct a kind of framework\n\n2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:23.720\n of thinking and a global conversation\n\n2:57:23.720 --> 2:57:28.400\n that minimizes the damage done by future lab leaks,\n\n2:57:28.400 --> 2:57:30.800\n which will almost certainly happen.\n\n2:57:30.800 --> 2:57:35.800\n And so to me, any lab leak is about the future.\n\n2:57:35.920 --> 2:57:40.080\n I would launch a giant investment in saying\n\n2:57:40.080 --> 2:57:43.480\n we're going to create a testing infrastructure,\n\n2:57:43.480 --> 2:57:46.800\n like all of this kind of infrastructure investments\n\n2:57:46.800 --> 2:57:49.560\n that help minimize the damage of a lab leak\n\n2:57:49.560 --> 2:57:51.320\n here and the rest of the world.\n\n2:57:51.320 --> 2:57:54.480\n So the challenge with that is one,\n\n2:57:54.480 --> 2:57:58.440\n it's hard to imagine a fully accountable future system\n\n2:57:58.440 --> 2:58:01.960\n to prevent these kinds of terrible pandemics\n\n2:58:01.960 --> 2:58:06.000\n that's built upon obfuscation and coverup\n\n2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:09.600\n regarding the origins of this worst pandemic in a century.\n\n2:58:09.600 --> 2:58:14.360\n So it's just like that foundation isn't strong enough.\n\n2:58:14.360 --> 2:58:17.840\n Second, China across the fields of science\n\n2:58:17.840 --> 2:58:20.760\n is looking to leapfrog the rest of the world.\n\n2:58:20.760 --> 2:58:25.160\n So China now has current plans to build BSL4 labs\n\n2:58:25.160 --> 2:58:27.120\n in every of its province.\n\n2:58:27.120 --> 2:58:28.640\n Yeah, they're scaling up the.\n\n2:58:28.640 --> 2:58:32.400\n Scaling up everything ends up with the plan on leading.\n\n2:58:32.400 --> 2:58:33.720\n And that's why, again, I was saying before,\n\n2:58:33.720 --> 2:58:36.720\n I think there's a lot of similarity between this story,\n\n2:58:36.720 --> 2:58:40.240\n at least as I see it, at least the most probable case,\n\n2:58:40.240 --> 2:58:42.680\n and these other areas where China gets knowledge\n\n2:58:42.680 --> 2:58:44.160\n and then tries to leapfrog.\n\n2:58:44.160 --> 2:58:48.400\n It's the same with AI and autonomous killer robots.\n\n2:58:48.400 --> 2:58:50.320\n It's the same with human genome editing,\n\n2:58:50.320 --> 2:58:52.800\n with animal experimentations, with so many,\n\n2:58:52.800 --> 2:58:57.000\n basically all areas of advanced science.\n\n2:58:58.040 --> 2:59:01.800\n So the question is, would China stop in that process?\n\n2:59:01.800 --> 2:59:05.600\n And then third, it's a little bit\n\n2:59:05.600 --> 2:59:07.040\n of a historical background,\n\n2:59:07.040 --> 2:59:10.640\n but defending national sovereignty\n\n2:59:10.640 --> 2:59:13.480\n is one of the core principles of,\n\n2:59:13.480 --> 2:59:16.080\n certainly of the Chinese state.\n\n2:59:16.080 --> 2:59:18.480\n And the historical issue is,\n\n2:59:18.480 --> 2:59:21.200\n for those of us who come from the West,\n\n2:59:21.200 --> 2:59:24.040\n I mean, one of the lessons of the postwar planners\n\n2:59:24.040 --> 2:59:26.960\n was that absolute national sovereignty\n\n2:59:26.960 --> 2:59:29.720\n was actually a major feeder\n\n2:59:29.720 --> 2:59:31.440\n into the first and second world wars,\n\n2:59:31.440 --> 2:59:34.320\n that we had all these conflicting states.\n\n2:59:34.320 --> 2:59:37.440\n And therefore the logic of the postwar system\n\n2:59:37.440 --> 2:59:39.640\n is we need to in some ways pool sovereignty\n\n2:59:39.640 --> 2:59:44.440\n that's like the EU and have transnational organizations\n\n2:59:44.440 --> 2:59:46.000\n like the UN organizations\n\n2:59:46.000 --> 2:59:47.840\n and the Bretton Woods organizations.\n\n2:59:47.840 --> 2:59:49.560\n For most Asian states,\n\n2:59:49.560 --> 2:59:51.800\n and also even for some African,\n\n2:59:51.800 --> 2:59:52.880\n and the people who were kind of\n\n2:59:52.880 --> 2:59:55.520\n on the colonized side of history,\n\n2:59:55.520 --> 2:59:58.720\n sovereignty was the thing that was denied them.\n\n2:59:58.720 --> 3:00:00.040\n That was the thing that they want,\n\n3:00:00.040 --> 3:00:01.880\n that the European power is denied.\n\n3:00:01.880 --> 3:00:04.720\n And so the idea of giving up sovereignty\n\n3:00:04.720 --> 3:00:07.040\n was the absolute opposite.\n\n3:00:07.040 --> 3:00:10.120\n And so that's why China is,\n\n3:00:10.120 --> 3:00:12.400\n and again, I mentioned this Rush Doshi book.\n\n3:00:12.400 --> 3:00:15.120\n It's not that China is trying to strengthen\n\n3:00:15.120 --> 3:00:17.200\n this rules based international order,\n\n3:00:17.200 --> 3:00:19.040\n which is based on the principle\n\n3:00:19.040 --> 3:00:21.240\n that while there are certain things that we share\n\n3:00:21.240 --> 3:00:23.800\n and how do we build a governance system\n\n3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:25.680\n to protect those things,\n\n3:00:25.680 --> 3:00:27.800\n what it seems to be doing is trying\n\n3:00:27.800 --> 3:00:31.320\n to advance its own sovereignty.\n\n3:00:31.320 --> 3:00:33.040\n And so I think I agree with you,\n\n3:00:33.040 --> 3:00:37.080\n but I don't think that we can just go forward\n\n3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:39.640\n without some accountability for the.\n\n3:00:39.640 --> 3:00:41.480\n So the coverup was a big problem.\n\n3:00:41.480 --> 3:00:44.080\n It's like, I often,\n\n3:00:44.080 --> 3:00:46.560\n I find myself playing devil's advocate\n\n3:00:46.560 --> 3:00:49.520\n because I'm trying to sort of empathize\n\n3:00:49.520 --> 3:00:54.280\n and then I forget that like two or three people\n\n3:00:54.280 --> 3:00:55.900\n listen to this thing and then they're like,\n\n3:00:55.900 --> 3:00:58.880\n look, Lex is defending the Chinese government\n\n3:00:58.880 --> 3:00:59.720\n with their coverup.\n\n3:00:59.720 --> 3:01:04.720\n No, I'm not, I'm just trying to understand.\n\n3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:08.040\n I mean, it's the same reason I'm reading Mein Kampf now\n\n3:01:08.040 --> 3:01:13.040\n is like you have to really understand the minds of people\n\n3:01:13.040 --> 3:01:18.040\n as if I too could have done that.\n\n3:01:18.360 --> 3:01:19.660\n You know, you have to understand\n\n3:01:19.660 --> 3:01:22.800\n that we're all the same to some degree\n\n3:01:22.800 --> 3:01:25.300\n and that kind of empathy is required\n\n3:01:25.300 --> 3:01:29.640\n to figure out solutions for the future.\n\n3:01:29.640 --> 3:01:32.620\n It's just in empathizing with the Chinese government\n\n3:01:32.620 --> 3:01:34.120\n in this whole situation,\n\n3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:38.220\n I'm still not sure I understand\n\n3:01:38.220 --> 3:01:41.840\n how to minimize the chance of a coverup in the future,\n\n3:01:41.840 --> 3:01:44.040\n whether for China or for the United States.\n\n3:01:44.040 --> 3:01:45.700\n If the virus started in the United States,\n\n3:01:45.700 --> 3:01:48.040\n I'm not exactly sure we would be\n\n3:01:49.380 --> 3:01:52.480\n with all the emphasis we put on freedom of speech,\n\n3:01:52.480 --> 3:01:57.480\n with all the emphasis we put on freedom of the press\n\n3:01:57.920 --> 3:02:00.480\n and access to the press,\n\n3:02:00.480 --> 3:02:02.680\n the sort of all aspects of government.\n\n3:02:02.680 --> 3:02:04.080\n I'm not sure the US government\n\n3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:06.040\n wouldn't do the similar kind of coverup.\n\n3:02:06.040 --> 3:02:07.280\n Let me put it this way.\n\n3:02:07.280 --> 3:02:09.900\n So we're in Texas now doing this interview.\n\n3:02:09.900 --> 3:02:13.560\n Imagine there's a kind of horseshoe bat\n\n3:02:13.560 --> 3:02:18.560\n that we'll call the Texas Horseshoe Bat and the Texas.\n\n3:02:18.580 --> 3:02:19.820\n There's a lot of bats in Austin,\n\n3:02:19.820 --> 3:02:21.960\n but it's a whole thing. It's true, it's true.\n\n3:02:21.960 --> 3:02:25.560\n And so let's just say that the Texas Horseshoe Bats\n\n3:02:25.560 --> 3:02:30.400\n only exist in Texas, but in Montana,\n\n3:02:30.400 --> 3:02:32.680\n we have a thing, it's called\n\n3:02:32.680 --> 3:02:36.240\n the Montana Institute of Virology.\n\n3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:38.860\n And at the Montana Institute of Virology,\n\n3:02:38.860 --> 3:02:41.440\n they have the world's largest collection\n\n3:02:41.440 --> 3:02:45.600\n of Texas Horseshoe Bats, including horseshoe bats\n\n3:02:45.600 --> 3:02:50.600\n that are associated with a previous global pandemic\n\n3:02:51.400 --> 3:02:55.000\n called the Texas Horseshoe Bat pandemic.\n\n3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:58.880\n And let's just say that people in Montana,\n\n3:02:58.880 --> 3:03:00.520\n in the same town where this\n\n3:03:00.520 --> 3:03:03.320\n Montana Institute of Virology is,\n\n3:03:03.320 --> 3:03:06.860\n start getting a version of this\n\n3:03:06.860 --> 3:03:09.960\n Texas Horseshoe Bat syndrome\n\n3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:13.600\n that is genetically relatively similar\n\n3:03:13.600 --> 3:03:15.240\n to the outbreak in Texas.\n\n3:03:15.240 --> 3:03:18.040\n There are no horseshoe bats there.\n\n3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:21.360\n And the government says, it's your same point,\n\n3:03:21.360 --> 3:03:23.280\n Alina's point about the unicorns,\n\n3:03:23.280 --> 3:03:26.040\n like nothing to see here, just move along.\n\n3:03:28.280 --> 3:03:33.280\n Would Joe Rogan and Brett Weinstein and Josh Rogan,\n\n3:03:34.320 --> 3:03:36.720\n would they say, oh, I guess, I just think that.\n\n3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:40.560\n No, no, but the point is the government going to say it.\n\n3:03:40.560 --> 3:03:45.040\n So, Joe Rogan is a comedian.\n\n3:03:45.040 --> 3:03:48.880\n Brett Weinstein is a podcaster.\n\n3:03:48.880 --> 3:03:53.480\n The point is, what we want is not just those folks\n\n3:03:53.480 --> 3:03:56.220\n to have the freedom to speak, that's important.\n\n3:03:56.220 --> 3:03:58.400\n But you want the government to have the transparent,\n\n3:03:58.400 --> 3:04:02.360\n like, I don't think Joe Rogan is enough\n\n3:04:02.360 --> 3:04:04.360\n to hold the government accountable.\n\n3:04:04.360 --> 3:04:06.800\n I think they're going to do their thing anyway.\n\n3:04:06.800 --> 3:04:09.080\n But I think that's our system,\n\n3:04:09.080 --> 3:04:12.320\n and that was the genius of the founding fathers.\n\n3:04:12.320 --> 3:04:13.240\n Is that enough?\n\n3:04:13.240 --> 3:04:16.040\n That the government probably is going to have\n\n3:04:16.040 --> 3:04:18.240\n a lot of instincts to do the wrong thing.\n\n3:04:18.240 --> 3:04:22.360\n That was the experience in England before.\n\n3:04:22.360 --> 3:04:25.800\n And so that's why we have free speech,\n\n3:04:25.800 --> 3:04:27.160\n to hold the government accountable.\n\n3:04:27.160 --> 3:04:30.160\n I mean, I'm kind of broadly a gun control person,\n\n3:04:30.160 --> 3:04:31.540\n but the people who say, well,\n\n3:04:31.540 --> 3:04:34.640\n we need to have broad gun rights.\n\n3:04:34.640 --> 3:04:39.040\n As somebody who's now in Texas, I am offended.\n\n3:04:39.040 --> 3:04:40.400\n But their argument is, look,\n\n3:04:40.400 --> 3:04:42.920\n we don't fully trust the government.\n\n3:04:42.920 --> 3:04:47.440\n If the government, just like we fought against the British,\n\n3:04:47.440 --> 3:04:48.520\n if the government's wrong,\n\n3:04:48.520 --> 3:04:51.040\n we want to at least have some authority.\n\n3:04:51.040 --> 3:04:53.640\n So that's our system, is to have that kind of voice.\n\n3:04:53.640 --> 3:04:57.600\n And that is the public voice actually balances.\n\n3:04:57.600 --> 3:05:00.080\n Because every government, as you correctly said,\n\n3:05:00.080 --> 3:05:02.880\n every government has the same instincts.\n\n3:05:02.880 --> 3:05:06.480\n And that's why we have, and it's imperfect here,\n\n3:05:06.480 --> 3:05:08.640\n but kind of these ideas of separation of powers,\n\n3:05:08.640 --> 3:05:11.280\n of inalienable rights, so that we can have,\n\n3:05:11.280 --> 3:05:14.620\n it's almost like a vast market where we can have balance.\n\n3:05:14.620 --> 3:05:17.940\n So you think if a lab leak occurred in the United States,\n\n3:05:18.900 --> 3:05:23.900\n what probability would you put some kind of public report\n\n3:05:24.120 --> 3:05:29.120\n led by Rand Paul would come out saying this was a lab leak?\n\n3:05:29.120 --> 3:05:31.600\n You have good confidence that that would happen?\n\n3:05:31.600 --> 3:05:32.440\n I have pretty decent confidence.\n\n3:05:32.440 --> 3:05:35.160\n And the reason I say, I mentioned that I'm a,\n\n3:05:35.160 --> 3:05:37.240\n I think of myself, I'm sure I'm not anymore,\n\n3:05:37.240 --> 3:05:39.840\n because as I get older, but as a progressive person,\n\n3:05:39.840 --> 3:05:44.280\n I'm a Democrat and I worked in Democratic administrations,\n\n3:05:44.280 --> 3:05:47.760\n worked for President Clinton on the National Security Council.\n\n3:05:47.760 --> 3:05:52.520\n But my kind of best friend in the United States Senate,\n\n3:05:52.520 --> 3:05:55.560\n who I talk to all the time,\n\n3:05:55.560 --> 3:05:59.400\n is a Senator from Kansas named Roger Marshall.\n\n3:05:59.400 --> 3:06:03.320\n And Roger, I mean, if you just lined up our positions\n\n3:06:03.320 --> 3:06:07.340\n on all sorts of things, we're radically different.\n\n3:06:08.480 --> 3:06:11.640\n But we have a great relationship.\n\n3:06:11.640 --> 3:06:16.080\n We talk all the time and we share a commitment to saying,\n\n3:06:16.080 --> 3:06:20.120\n well, let's ask the tough questions about how this started.\n\n3:06:20.120 --> 3:06:22.600\n And again, if we had,\n\n3:06:22.600 --> 3:06:24.280\n like what is the United States government?\n\n3:06:24.280 --> 3:06:27.280\n Yeah, it's the executive branch, but there's also Congress.\n\n3:06:27.280 --> 3:06:29.880\n And Congress, you talk about Rand Paul,\n\n3:06:29.880 --> 3:06:33.480\n and as a former executive branch worker,\n\n3:06:33.480 --> 3:06:35.560\n when I was on the National Security Council,\n\n3:06:35.560 --> 3:06:38.880\n and I guess technically when I was at the State Department,\n\n3:06:38.880 --> 3:06:40.800\n all of this stuff, all of this process,\n\n3:06:40.800 --> 3:06:42.600\n it just seems like a pain in the ass.\n\n3:06:42.600 --> 3:06:46.680\n It's like these Fers, they're just attacking us.\n\n3:06:46.680 --> 3:06:48.360\n We tried to do this thing with,\n\n3:06:48.360 --> 3:06:49.840\n we had all the best intentions\n\n3:06:49.840 --> 3:06:50.960\n and now they're holding hearings\n\n3:06:50.960 --> 3:06:53.680\n and they're trying to box us in and whatever.\n\n3:06:53.680 --> 3:06:55.040\n But that's our process.\n\n3:06:55.040 --> 3:06:58.260\n And there's like a form of accountability as chaotic,\n\n3:06:58.260 --> 3:07:00.640\n as crazy as it is.\n\n3:07:00.640 --> 3:07:03.400\n And so it makes it really difficult.\n\n3:07:03.400 --> 3:07:05.640\n I mean, we have other problems of just chaos\n\n3:07:05.640 --> 3:07:07.580\n and everybody doing their own thing,\n\n3:07:07.580 --> 3:07:09.840\n but it makes it difficult to have\n\n3:07:09.840 --> 3:07:11.620\n the kind of systematic coverup.\n\n3:07:11.620 --> 3:07:15.900\n And again, all of that is predicated on my hypothesis,\n\n3:07:15.900 --> 3:07:18.600\n not fully proven, although I think likely\n\n3:07:18.600 --> 3:07:22.960\n that there is a lab incident origin of this pandemic.\n\n3:07:22.960 --> 3:07:25.800\n Well, I mean, we're having like several layers\n\n3:07:25.800 --> 3:07:30.800\n of conversation, but I think whether lab leak hypothesis\n\n3:07:31.800 --> 3:07:36.640\n is true or not, it does seem that the likelihood\n\n3:07:36.640 --> 3:07:41.640\n of a coverup, if it leaked from a lab is high.\n\n3:07:41.880 --> 3:07:45.360\n That's the more important conversation to be having.\n\n3:07:45.360 --> 3:07:48.000\n Well, you could argue a lot of things,\n\n3:07:48.000 --> 3:07:51.480\n but to me arguably, that's the more important conversation\n\n3:07:51.480 --> 3:07:53.720\n is about what is the likelihood of a coverup.\n\n3:07:53.720 --> 3:07:58.720\n 100%, like in my mind, there is a legitimate debate\n\n3:07:59.400 --> 3:08:01.920\n about the origins of the pandemic.\n\n3:08:01.920 --> 3:08:04.080\n There are people who I respect,\n\n3:08:04.080 --> 3:08:06.360\n who I don't necessarily agree with,\n\n3:08:06.360 --> 3:08:10.040\n people like Stuart Neal, who's a virologist in the UK,\n\n3:08:10.040 --> 3:08:14.880\n who's been very open minded, engaged in productive debate\n\n3:08:14.880 --> 3:08:18.200\n about the origin and you know where I stand.\n\n3:08:18.200 --> 3:08:23.200\n There is and can be no debate about whether\n\n3:08:23.200 --> 3:08:25.240\n or not there has been a coverup.\n\n3:08:25.240 --> 3:08:26.400\n There has been a coverup.\n\n3:08:26.400 --> 3:08:29.600\n There is in my mind, no credible argument\n\n3:08:29.600 --> 3:08:31.340\n that there hasn't been a coverup.\n\n3:08:31.340 --> 3:08:35.440\n And I mean, we can just see it in the regulations,\n\n3:08:35.440 --> 3:08:37.120\n in the lack of access.\n\n3:08:37.120 --> 3:08:40.480\n There's an incredible woman named Zhang Zhan,\n\n3:08:40.480 --> 3:08:44.240\n who is a Chinese, we have to call her a citizen journalist\n\n3:08:44.240 --> 3:08:46.060\n because everything is controlled by the state.\n\n3:08:46.060 --> 3:08:47.720\n But in the early days of the pandemic,\n\n3:08:47.720 --> 3:08:52.040\n she went to Wuhan, started taking videos and posting them.\n\n3:08:52.040 --> 3:08:54.920\n She was imprisoned for picking quarrels,\n\n3:08:54.920 --> 3:08:57.440\n which is kind of a catchall.\n\n3:08:57.440 --> 3:09:00.260\n And now she's engaged in a hunger strike\n\n3:09:00.260 --> 3:09:02.000\n and she's near death.\n\n3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:06.680\n And so there's no question that there has been a coverup\n\n3:09:06.680 --> 3:09:08.280\n and there's no question in my mind\n\n3:09:08.280 --> 3:09:10.400\n that that coverup is responsible\n\n3:09:10.400 --> 3:09:13.920\n for a significant percentage of the total deaths\n\n3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:15.040\n due to COVID 19.\n\n3:09:15.040 --> 3:09:20.040\n In a pivot, can I talk to you about sex?\n\n3:09:22.040 --> 3:09:23.400\n Let's roll.\n\n3:09:23.400 --> 3:09:26.520\n Okay, so you're the author of a book, Hacking Darwin.\n\n3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:34.120\n So humans have used sex, allegedly, as I've read about,\n\n3:09:36.200 --> 3:09:41.200\n to mix genetic information to produce offspring\n\n3:09:41.200 --> 3:09:46.200\n and through that kind of process adapted their environment.\n\n3:09:49.920 --> 3:09:51.880\n Lex, you mentioned earlier about\n\n3:09:51.880 --> 3:09:53.680\n you're asking tough questions\n\n3:09:53.680 --> 3:09:56.640\n and people pushing you to ask tough questions.\n\n3:09:56.640 --> 3:09:57.680\n Is it okay if I just?\n\n3:09:57.680 --> 3:10:01.240\n So you said, have done this as I've read about.\n\n3:10:01.240 --> 3:10:03.400\n As I've read about on the internet, yeah.\n\n3:10:03.400 --> 3:10:06.280\n All I'm saying, as a person sitting with you,\n\n3:10:06.280 --> 3:10:11.280\n to people who would be open minded in experimenting\n\n3:10:11.360 --> 3:10:13.680\n of, as I've read about, to reality,\n\n3:10:13.680 --> 3:10:18.680\n what I would say is Lex Friedman is handsome, charming.\n\n3:10:19.880 --> 3:10:23.960\n He's really a great guy.\n\n3:10:23.960 --> 3:10:24.800\n I'm sorry to interrupt.\n\n3:10:24.800 --> 3:10:26.760\n Thank you, I appreciate that.\n\n3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:28.720\n So I was reading about this last night.\n\n3:10:28.720 --> 3:10:30.080\n I was gonna tweet it, but then I'm like,\n\n3:10:30.080 --> 3:10:32.360\n this is going to be misinterpreted.\n\n3:10:32.360 --> 3:10:36.080\n But this is why I like podcasts,\n\n3:10:36.080 --> 3:10:38.160\n because I can say stuff like this.\n\n3:10:40.160 --> 3:10:45.160\n It's kind of incredible to me that the average human male\n\n3:10:45.480 --> 3:10:50.480\n produces 500 billion plus sperm cells in their lifetime.\n\n3:10:52.760 --> 3:10:55.280\n Each one of those are genetically unique.\n\n3:10:57.360 --> 3:10:59.880\n They can produce unique humans.\n\n3:10:59.880 --> 3:11:01.840\n Each one of them, 500 billion,\n\n3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:06.440\n there's 100 billion people who's ever lived.\n\n3:11:06.440 --> 3:11:09.400\n Maybe 110, whatever, whatever the number is.\n\n3:11:09.400 --> 3:11:12.360\n So it's five times the number of people who ever lived\n\n3:11:12.360 --> 3:11:17.360\n is produced by each male of genetic information.\n\n3:11:18.400 --> 3:11:20.760\n So those are all possible trajectories of lives\n\n3:11:20.760 --> 3:11:22.400\n that could have lived.\n\n3:11:22.400 --> 3:11:25.520\n Those are all little people that could have been.\n\n3:11:25.520 --> 3:11:28.160\n And all the possible stories.\n\n3:11:28.160 --> 3:11:31.040\n All the Hitlers and Einsteins\n\n3:11:31.040 --> 3:11:32.240\n that could have been created.\n\n3:11:32.240 --> 3:11:34.160\n And all that, I mean, I don't know,\n\n3:11:34.160 --> 3:11:38.320\n this kind of, you're painting this possible future,\n\n3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:40.720\n and we get to see only one little string of that.\n\n3:11:40.720 --> 3:11:43.400\n I mean, I suppose the magic of that\n\n3:11:43.400 --> 3:11:47.320\n is also captured by the, in the space of physics,\n\n3:11:47.320 --> 3:11:49.720\n having multiple dimensions\n\n3:11:49.720 --> 3:11:53.440\n and the many worlds hypothesis of quantum mechanics,\n\n3:11:53.440 --> 3:11:57.760\n the interpretation that we're basically just,\n\n3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:02.280\n at every point, there's an infinite offspring\n\n3:12:02.280 --> 3:12:04.760\n of universes that are created.\n\n3:12:04.760 --> 3:12:06.720\n But I don't know, that's just like a magic\n\n3:12:06.720 --> 3:12:10.840\n of this game of genetics that we're playing.\n\n3:12:11.800 --> 3:12:15.240\n And the winning sperm is not the fastest.\n\n3:12:16.680 --> 3:12:19.400\n The winning sperm is basically the luckiest,\n\n3:12:19.400 --> 3:12:21.080\n has the right timing.\n\n3:12:21.080 --> 3:12:24.880\n So it's not, I also got into this whole,\n\n3:12:24.880 --> 3:12:29.400\n I started reading papers about like,\n\n3:12:29.400 --> 3:12:30.680\n is there something to be said\n\n3:12:30.680 --> 3:12:34.040\n about who wins the race, right, genetically?\n\n3:12:34.040 --> 3:12:36.040\n So it's fascinating, because there's studies\n\n3:12:36.040 --> 3:12:38.480\n in animals and so on to answer that question,\n\n3:12:38.480 --> 3:12:41.720\n because it's interesting, because I'm a winner, right?\n\n3:12:41.720 --> 3:12:43.720\n I won, I won a race.\n\n3:12:43.720 --> 3:12:46.560\n And so you want to know, what does that say about me\n\n3:12:46.560 --> 3:12:50.760\n in this fascinating genetic race against,\n\n3:12:50.760 --> 3:12:54.320\n I think, what is it, 200 million others, I think.\n\n3:12:54.320 --> 3:12:59.320\n So one pool of sperm cells is about something\n\n3:13:01.080 --> 3:13:04.480\n like 200 million, it could be, yes.\n\n3:13:04.480 --> 3:13:08.040\n But that, millions, I thought it was much lower than that.\n\n3:13:08.040 --> 3:13:13.040\n So like that, those are all brothers and sisters of mine,\n\n3:13:13.360 --> 3:13:16.560\n and I beat them all out, I won.\n\n3:13:16.560 --> 3:13:19.320\n And so it's interesting to know,\n\n3:13:21.280 --> 3:13:24.120\n there's a temptation to say I'm somehow better than them,\n\n3:13:24.120 --> 3:13:28.320\n right, and now that goes into the next stage\n\n3:13:28.320 --> 3:13:31.800\n of something we're deeply thinking about,\n\n3:13:33.160 --> 3:13:38.160\n which is if we have more control now\n\n3:13:38.800 --> 3:13:43.800\n over the winning genetic code that becomes offspring,\n\n3:13:44.800 --> 3:13:46.600\n if we have first not even control,\n\n3:13:46.600 --> 3:13:50.280\n just information and then control,\n\n3:13:50.280 --> 3:13:53.160\n what do you think that world looks like\n\n3:13:53.160 --> 3:13:54.960\n from a biological perspective\n\n3:13:54.960 --> 3:13:56.520\n and from an ethical perspective\n\n3:13:56.520 --> 3:14:00.760\n when we start getting more information and more control?\n\n3:14:00.760 --> 3:14:02.320\n Yeah, great question.\n\n3:14:02.320 --> 3:14:05.880\n So first, on the sperm, there can be up to\n\n3:14:05.880 --> 3:14:10.600\n about 1.2 billion sperm cells in a male ejaculation.\n\n3:14:10.600 --> 3:14:13.200\n So as I mentioned in Hacking Darwin,\n\n3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:15.400\n male sperm, it's kind of a dime a dozen\n\n3:14:15.400 --> 3:14:18.400\n with all the guys in all the world\n\n3:14:18.400 --> 3:14:20.320\n just doing whatever they do with it.\n\n3:14:20.320 --> 3:14:25.320\n And it's an open question how competitive,\n\n3:14:25.640 --> 3:14:27.800\n I mean, there is an element of luck\n\n3:14:27.800 --> 3:14:31.120\n and there is an element of competition,\n\n3:14:31.120 --> 3:14:36.120\n and it's an open question how much that competition\n\n3:14:36.120 --> 3:14:39.600\n impacts the outcome or whether it's just luck,\n\n3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:42.200\n but my guess is there's some combination\n\n3:14:42.200 --> 3:14:44.560\n of fitness and luck.\n\n3:14:44.560 --> 3:14:48.000\n But you're absolutely right that all of those other\n\n3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:51.280\n sperm cells in the ejaculation,\n\n3:14:51.280 --> 3:14:55.800\n if that's how the union of the sperm and egg is happening,\n\n3:14:55.800 --> 3:14:59.360\n all of them represent a different future.\n\n3:14:59.360 --> 3:15:03.800\n And there's a wonderful book called Invisible Cities\n\n3:15:03.800 --> 3:15:08.080\n by Italo Calvino, and he even talks about a city\n\n3:15:08.080 --> 3:15:10.280\n as something like this where everybody,\n\n3:15:10.280 --> 3:15:12.160\n you have your life,\n\n3:15:12.160 --> 3:15:14.240\n but then you have all these alternate lives\n\n3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:16.480\n and every time you make any decision,\n\n3:15:16.480 --> 3:15:19.280\n you're kind of, and so, but in this Invisible Cities,\n\n3:15:19.280 --> 3:15:23.280\n there's a little string that goes toward that alternate life\n\n3:15:23.280 --> 3:15:25.520\n and then the city becomes this weaving\n\n3:15:25.520 --> 3:15:28.960\n of all the strings of people's real lives\n\n3:15:28.960 --> 3:15:31.680\n and the alternate lives that they could have taken\n\n3:15:31.680 --> 3:15:34.000\n had they made any other different steps.\n\n3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:37.600\n So that part, it's like a deep philosophical question.\n\n3:15:37.600 --> 3:15:39.480\n It's not just for us, it's for all of,\n\n3:15:39.480 --> 3:15:43.280\n I mean, it's baked into evolutionary biology.\n\n3:15:43.280 --> 3:15:45.280\n It's just what are the different strategies\n\n3:15:45.280 --> 3:15:48.400\n for different species to achieve fitness?\n\n3:15:48.400 --> 3:15:52.000\n And there's some of the different corals or other fish\n\n3:15:52.000 --> 3:15:55.320\n where they just kind of release the eggs into the water\n\n3:15:55.320 --> 3:15:58.880\n and there's all different kinds of ways.\n\n3:15:58.880 --> 3:16:03.120\n And then you're right in my book, Hacking Darwin,\n\n3:16:03.120 --> 3:16:04.840\n and it's the full title is Hacking Darwin,\n\n3:16:04.840 --> 3:16:07.440\n Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity.\n\n3:16:08.600 --> 3:16:12.360\n I kind of go deep into exploring\n\n3:16:12.360 --> 3:16:15.360\n the big picture implications of the future\n\n3:16:15.360 --> 3:16:17.920\n of human reproduction.\n\n3:16:17.920 --> 3:16:20.880\n We are already participating\n\n3:16:20.880 --> 3:16:23.400\n in a revolutionary transformation,\n\n3:16:23.400 --> 3:16:26.320\n not just because of the diagnostics that we have,\n\n3:16:26.320 --> 3:16:29.440\n things like ultrasound, but because now\n\n3:16:29.440 --> 3:16:31.960\n an increasing number of us are being born\n\n3:16:31.960 --> 3:16:33.800\n through in vitro fertilization,\n\n3:16:33.800 --> 3:16:36.520\n which means the eggs are extracted from the mother,\n\n3:16:36.520 --> 3:16:41.160\n they're fertilized by the father's sperm in vitro in a lab,\n\n3:16:41.160 --> 3:16:45.080\n and then reimplanted in the mother.\n\n3:16:45.080 --> 3:16:48.800\n On top of that, there's a somewhat newer,\n\n3:16:48.800 --> 3:16:52.720\n but still now older technology\n\n3:16:52.720 --> 3:16:55.520\n called preimplantation genetic testing.\n\n3:16:55.520 --> 3:16:58.600\n And so as everyone knows from high school biology,\n\n3:16:58.600 --> 3:17:01.320\n you have the fertilized egg,\n\n3:17:01.320 --> 3:17:03.920\n and then it goes one cell to two cells\n\n3:17:03.920 --> 3:17:05.240\n to four to eight and whatever.\n\n3:17:05.240 --> 3:17:09.560\n And after around five days in this PGT process,\n\n3:17:09.560 --> 3:17:12.160\n a few cells are extracted.\n\n3:17:12.160 --> 3:17:15.400\n So let's say you have 10 fertilized eggs,\n\n3:17:15.400 --> 3:17:18.480\n early stage embryos, a few cells are extracted from each,\n\n3:17:18.480 --> 3:17:21.200\n and those cells, if they would,\n\n3:17:21.200 --> 3:17:22.120\n the ones that are extracted\n\n3:17:22.120 --> 3:17:25.000\n would end up becoming the placenta.\n\n3:17:25.000 --> 3:17:28.600\n But every one of our cells has, other than a few,\n\n3:17:28.600 --> 3:17:30.960\n has our full genome.\n\n3:17:30.960 --> 3:17:33.040\n And so then you sequence those cells\n\n3:17:33.040 --> 3:17:36.400\n and with preimplantation genetic testing now,\n\n3:17:36.400 --> 3:17:41.400\n what you can do is you can screen out deadly single gel,\n\n3:17:41.520 --> 3:17:44.280\n a single gene mutation disorders,\n\n3:17:44.280 --> 3:17:47.120\n things that could be deadly or life ruining.\n\n3:17:47.120 --> 3:17:49.400\n And so people use it to determine\n\n3:17:49.400 --> 3:17:53.240\n which of those 10 early stage embryos\n\n3:17:53.240 --> 3:17:55.680\n to implant in a mother.\n\n3:17:55.680 --> 3:17:59.000\n As we shift towards a much greater understanding\n\n3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:01.480\n of genetics, and that is part of our,\n\n3:18:01.480 --> 3:18:04.160\n just the broader genetics revolution,\n\n3:18:04.160 --> 3:18:07.760\n but within that, in our transition from personalized\n\n3:18:07.760 --> 3:18:10.400\n to precision healthcare, more and more of us\n\n3:18:10.400 --> 3:18:12.400\n are going to have our whole genome sequenced\n\n3:18:12.400 --> 3:18:13.920\n because it's gonna be the foundation\n\n3:18:13.920 --> 3:18:16.000\n of getting personalized healthcare.\n\n3:18:16.000 --> 3:18:19.360\n We're going to have already millions, but very soon,\n\n3:18:19.360 --> 3:18:22.840\n billions of people who've had their whole genome sequenced.\n\n3:18:22.840 --> 3:18:24.920\n And then we'll have big databases\n\n3:18:24.920 --> 3:18:27.640\n of people's genetic genotypic information\n\n3:18:27.640 --> 3:18:30.040\n and life or phenotypic information.\n\n3:18:30.040 --> 3:18:32.280\n And using, coming into your area,\n\n3:18:32.280 --> 3:18:35.120\n our tools of machine learning and data analytics,\n\n3:18:35.120 --> 3:18:38.360\n we're going to be able to increasingly understand\n\n3:18:38.360 --> 3:18:41.160\n patterns of genetic expression, even though we're all.\n\n3:18:41.160 --> 3:18:44.320\n So predict how the genetic information will get expressed.\n\n3:18:44.320 --> 3:18:45.920\n Correct. Yeah.\n\n3:18:45.920 --> 3:18:48.880\n Never perfectly perhaps, but more and more,\n\n3:18:48.880 --> 3:18:50.440\n always more and more.\n\n3:18:50.440 --> 3:18:54.480\n And so with that information, we aren't going to just be,\n\n3:18:54.480 --> 3:18:59.480\n even now, we aren't going to just be selecting based on\n\n3:18:59.480 --> 3:19:02.120\n which of these 10 early stage embryos\n\n3:19:02.120 --> 3:19:04.640\n is carrying a deadly genetic disorder,\n\n3:19:04.640 --> 3:19:06.880\n but we can, we'll be able to know everything\n\n3:19:06.880 --> 3:19:11.880\n that can be partly or entirely predicted by genetics.\n\n3:19:12.240 --> 3:19:14.560\n And there's a lot of our humanity\n\n3:19:14.560 --> 3:19:17.200\n that fits into that category.\n\n3:19:17.200 --> 3:19:22.200\n And certainly simple traits like height and eye color\n\n3:19:22.360 --> 3:19:23.760\n and things like that.\n\n3:19:23.760 --> 3:19:25.400\n I mean, height is not at all simple,\n\n3:19:25.400 --> 3:19:28.760\n but it's, if you have good nutrition,\n\n3:19:28.760 --> 3:19:31.320\n it's entirely or mostly genetic.\n\n3:19:31.320 --> 3:19:34.280\n But even personality traits and personality styles,\n\n3:19:34.280 --> 3:19:37.360\n there are a lot of things that we see just as the experience,\n\n3:19:37.360 --> 3:19:42.000\n the beauty of life that are partly have a genetic foundation.\n\n3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:47.000\n And so whatever part of these traits are definable\n\n3:19:47.240 --> 3:19:49.880\n and influenced by genetics,\n\n3:19:49.880 --> 3:19:53.120\n we're going to have greater and greater predictability\n\n3:19:53.120 --> 3:19:54.520\n within a range.\n\n3:19:54.520 --> 3:19:59.520\n And so selecting those embryos will be informed\n\n3:19:59.880 --> 3:20:02.440\n by that kind of knowledge.\n\n3:20:02.440 --> 3:20:04.520\n And that's why in Hacking Darwin,\n\n3:20:04.520 --> 3:20:09.280\n I talk about embryo selection as being a key driver\n\n3:20:09.280 --> 3:20:11.560\n of the future of human evolution.\n\n3:20:11.560 --> 3:20:15.240\n But then on top of that, there is in 2012,\n\n3:20:15.240 --> 3:20:19.760\n Shinya Yamanaka, an amazing Japanese scientist\n\n3:20:19.760 --> 3:20:22.960\n won the Nobel Prize for developing a process\n\n3:20:22.960 --> 3:20:26.400\n for creating what are called induced pluripotent stem cells,\n\n3:20:26.400 --> 3:20:27.640\n IPS cells.\n\n3:20:27.640 --> 3:20:31.760\n And what IPS cells are is you can induce an adult cell\n\n3:20:31.760 --> 3:20:35.200\n to go back in evolutionary time and become a stem cell.\n\n3:20:35.200 --> 3:20:39.600\n And a stem cell is like when we're a fertilized egg,\n\n3:20:39.600 --> 3:20:42.640\n like our entire blueprint is in that one cell\n\n3:20:42.640 --> 3:20:44.160\n and that cell can be anything,\n\n3:20:44.160 --> 3:20:48.120\n but then it starts to, our cells start to specialize.\n\n3:20:48.120 --> 3:20:50.440\n And that's why we have skin cells and blood cells\n\n3:20:50.440 --> 3:20:51.560\n and all the different types of things.\n\n3:20:51.560 --> 3:20:54.640\n So with the Yamanaka process,\n\n3:20:54.640 --> 3:20:59.640\n we can induce an adult cell to become a stem cell.\n\n3:20:59.880 --> 3:21:02.960\n So the relevance to this story is what you can do.\n\n3:21:02.960 --> 3:21:05.080\n And it works now in animal models.\n\n3:21:05.080 --> 3:21:08.240\n And as far as I know, it hasn't yet been done in humans,\n\n3:21:08.240 --> 3:21:11.080\n but it works pretty well in animal models.\n\n3:21:11.080 --> 3:21:12.280\n You take any adult cell,\n\n3:21:12.280 --> 3:21:15.000\n but skin cells are probably the easiest.\n\n3:21:15.960 --> 3:21:19.760\n You induce this skin cell into a stem cell.\n\n3:21:19.760 --> 3:21:21.640\n And if you just take a little skin graft,\n\n3:21:21.640 --> 3:21:23.760\n it would have millions of cells.\n\n3:21:23.760 --> 3:21:26.760\n You induce those skin cells into stem cells.\n\n3:21:26.760 --> 3:21:31.480\n Then you induce those stem cells into egg precursor cells.\n\n3:21:31.480 --> 3:21:35.880\n Then you induce those egg precursor cells into eggs,\n\n3:21:35.880 --> 3:21:37.120\n egg cells.\n\n3:21:37.120 --> 3:21:41.080\n Then because we have this massive overabundance\n\n3:21:41.080 --> 3:21:45.280\n of male sperm, then you could fertilize,\n\n3:21:45.280 --> 3:21:49.600\n let's call it 10,000 of the mother's eggs.\n\n3:21:49.600 --> 3:21:52.680\n So you have 10,000 eggs, which are fertilized.\n\n3:21:52.680 --> 3:21:53.680\n Sounds like a party.\n\n3:21:53.680 --> 3:21:54.520\n Yeah.\n\n3:21:54.520 --> 3:21:58.160\n Then you have an automated process\n\n3:21:58.160 --> 3:22:00.560\n for what I mentioned before\n\n3:22:00.560 --> 3:22:02.280\n in preimplantation genetic testing,\n\n3:22:02.280 --> 3:22:04.080\n you grow them all for five days,\n\n3:22:04.080 --> 3:22:07.080\n you extract a few cells from each, you test them.\n\n3:22:07.080 --> 3:22:09.000\n And that's why I had a piece in the New York Times\n\n3:22:09.000 --> 3:22:09.920\n a couple of years ago,\n\n3:22:09.920 --> 3:22:12.880\n imagining what it would be like to go to a fertility clinic\n\n3:22:12.880 --> 3:22:14.560\n in the year 2050.\n\n3:22:14.560 --> 3:22:15.400\n And the choice is not.\n\n3:22:15.400 --> 3:22:16.400\n No humans involved.\n\n3:22:16.400 --> 3:22:17.240\n Yeah.\n\n3:22:17.240 --> 3:22:19.400\n Well, no, no, there are, but the choice is not,\n\n3:22:19.400 --> 3:22:22.760\n do you want a kid who does or doesn't have,\n\n3:22:22.760 --> 3:22:25.400\n let's call it Tay Sachs.\n\n3:22:25.400 --> 3:22:28.600\n It's a whole range of possibilities,\n\n3:22:28.600 --> 3:22:31.600\n including very intimate traits\n\n3:22:33.360 --> 3:22:35.880\n like height, IQ, personality style.\n\n3:22:35.880 --> 3:22:37.840\n It doesn't mean you can predict everything,\n\n3:22:37.840 --> 3:22:41.320\n but it means there will be increasing predictability.\n\n3:22:41.320 --> 3:22:45.200\n So if you're choosing from 10,000 eggs,\n\n3:22:45.200 --> 3:22:47.520\n fertilized eggs, early stage embryos,\n\n3:22:47.520 --> 3:22:49.520\n that's a lot of choice.\n\n3:22:49.520 --> 3:22:52.040\n And on top of that,\n\n3:22:52.040 --> 3:22:57.040\n then we have the new technology of human genome editing.\n\n3:22:57.840 --> 3:23:00.040\n Many people have heard of CRISPR,\n\n3:23:00.040 --> 3:23:02.600\n but what I say is if you think of human genome editing\n\n3:23:02.600 --> 3:23:07.320\n as a pie, sorry, human genome engineering as a pie,\n\n3:23:07.320 --> 3:23:08.920\n genome editing is a slice\n\n3:23:08.920 --> 3:23:11.360\n and CRISPR is just a sliver of that slice.\n\n3:23:11.360 --> 3:23:13.840\n It's just one of our tools for genome editing\n\n3:23:13.840 --> 3:23:16.440\n and things are getting better and better.\n\n3:23:16.440 --> 3:23:20.320\n Then you can go in and change.\n\n3:23:20.320 --> 3:23:23.000\n Let's say, I mean, again, it starts simple.\n\n3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:24.640\n A small number of genes,\n\n3:23:24.640 --> 3:23:27.680\n let's say you've selected from among the one of 10\n\n3:23:27.680 --> 3:23:29.840\n or the one of 10,000,\n\n3:23:29.840 --> 3:23:31.160\n but there are a number of changes\n\n3:23:31.160 --> 3:23:33.760\n that you would like to make to achieve some kind of outcome.\n\n3:23:33.760 --> 3:23:36.080\n And biology is incredibly complex\n\n3:23:36.080 --> 3:23:38.440\n and it's not that one gene does one thing.\n\n3:23:38.440 --> 3:23:42.400\n One gene does probably a lot of things simultaneously,\n\n3:23:42.400 --> 3:23:45.280\n which is why the decision about changing one gene\n\n3:23:45.280 --> 3:23:48.280\n if it's causing deathly harm is easier\n\n3:23:48.280 --> 3:23:51.880\n than when we think about the complexity of biology.\n\n3:23:51.880 --> 3:23:52.720\n But then the machine learning\n\n3:23:52.720 --> 3:23:54.560\n gets better and better at predicting\n\n3:23:54.560 --> 3:23:55.840\n the full complexity of biology.\n\n3:23:55.840 --> 3:23:58.280\n So as one gets better,\n\n3:23:58.280 --> 3:24:03.000\n then you're editing your ability to reliably edit\n\n3:24:03.000 --> 3:24:04.880\n such that the conclusions are predictable,\n\n3:24:04.880 --> 3:24:05.720\n it gets better and better.\n\n3:24:05.720 --> 3:24:07.240\n So those two are coupled together.\n\n3:24:07.240 --> 3:24:08.840\n You got it, that's exactly it.\n\n3:24:08.840 --> 3:24:11.160\n And then, so that's why, and people would say,\n\n3:24:11.160 --> 3:24:12.960\n well, that, I mean, I wrote about that\n\n3:24:12.960 --> 3:24:15.480\n in my two science fiction novels,\n\n3:24:15.480 --> 3:24:18.200\n Genesis Code and Eternal Sonata years ago,\n\n3:24:18.200 --> 3:24:20.760\n and especially with Genesis Code, I wrote about that.\n\n3:24:20.760 --> 3:24:22.880\n And as a sci fi,\n\n3:24:22.880 --> 3:24:25.760\n and I had actually testified before Congress,\n\n3:24:25.760 --> 3:24:27.320\n but now 15 years ago saying,\n\n3:24:27.320 --> 3:24:30.440\n here's what the future looks like.\n\n3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:35.440\n But even I, and in my first edition of Hacking Darwin,\n\n3:24:35.440 --> 3:24:38.560\n when it was already in production,\n\n3:24:38.560 --> 3:24:41.840\n and then in November 2018,\n\n3:24:41.840 --> 3:24:46.840\n this scientist, Hojong Kui, announced in Hong Kong\n\n3:24:47.240 --> 3:24:50.320\n that the world's first two, and later three,\n\n3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:51.720\n CRISPR babies had been born,\n\n3:24:51.720 --> 3:24:53.760\n which he had genetically altered,\n\n3:24:53.760 --> 3:24:57.920\n and misguided, in my view, and dangerous view,\n\n3:24:57.920 --> 3:25:02.920\n dangerous goal of making it so they would have\n\n3:25:02.920 --> 3:25:07.040\n increased resistance to HIV.\n\n3:25:07.040 --> 3:25:09.200\n And so I called my publisher,\n\n3:25:09.200 --> 3:25:11.720\n and I said, I've got good news and bad news.\n\n3:25:11.720 --> 3:25:13.000\n I'll start with the bad news,\n\n3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:17.080\n is that the world's first CRISPR babies have been born,\n\n3:25:17.080 --> 3:25:21.000\n and so we need to pull my book out of production,\n\n3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:22.800\n because you can't have a book on the future\n\n3:25:22.800 --> 3:25:24.840\n of human genetic engineering,\n\n3:25:24.840 --> 3:25:27.400\n and have it not mention the first CRISPR babies\n\n3:25:27.400 --> 3:25:28.680\n that had been born.\n\n3:25:28.680 --> 3:25:31.480\n But the good news is, in the book,\n\n3:25:31.480 --> 3:25:34.440\n I had predicted that it's going to happen,\n\n3:25:34.440 --> 3:25:37.760\n and it's going to happen in China, and here's why.\n\n3:25:37.760 --> 3:25:42.200\n And all we need to do is add a few more sentences,\n\n3:25:42.200 --> 3:25:43.360\n and that was the hardback,\n\n3:25:43.360 --> 3:25:45.240\n and then I updated it more in the paperback,\n\n3:25:45.240 --> 3:25:48.760\n saying, and it happened, and it was announced on this day.\n\n3:25:48.760 --> 3:25:50.080\n Yeah.\n\n3:25:50.080 --> 3:25:52.960\n Well, then let's fast forward.\n\n3:25:52.960 --> 3:25:57.320\n Given your predictions are slowly becoming reality,\n\n3:25:59.680 --> 3:26:01.240\n let's talk about some philosophy,\n\n3:26:01.240 --> 3:26:02.600\n and ethics, I suppose.\n\n3:26:03.640 --> 3:26:07.800\n So I can, I'm not being too self deprecating here,\n\n3:26:07.800 --> 3:26:12.240\n and saying if my parents had the choice,\n\n3:26:14.360 --> 3:26:18.400\n I would be probably less likely to come out the winner.\n\n3:26:18.400 --> 3:26:23.400\n We're all weird, and I'm certainly a very distinctly\n\n3:26:23.440 --> 3:26:26.920\n weird specimen of the human species.\n\n3:26:26.920 --> 3:26:29.760\n I can give the full long list of flaws,\n\n3:26:29.760 --> 3:26:33.320\n and we can be very poetic of saying those are features,\n\n3:26:33.320 --> 3:26:36.320\n and so on, but they're not.\n\n3:26:37.400 --> 3:26:39.000\n If you look at the menu.\n\n3:26:40.160 --> 3:26:42.640\n Again, for these women who are listening,\n\n3:26:42.640 --> 3:26:43.760\n apropos of your thing,\n\n3:26:43.760 --> 3:26:47.280\n they're all kind of charming individualities.\n\n3:26:47.280 --> 3:26:50.240\n Yes, that's beautiful, that's one, yes, thank you.\n\n3:26:50.240 --> 3:26:52.960\n But anyway, but on the full sort of individual,\n\n3:26:52.960 --> 3:26:55.040\n let's say IQ alone, right?\n\n3:26:55.040 --> 3:27:00.040\n That what do we do about a world\n\n3:27:02.800 --> 3:27:07.800\n where IQ could be selected on a menu\n\n3:27:09.080 --> 3:27:10.480\n when you're having children?\n\n3:27:13.680 --> 3:27:15.680\n What concerns you about that world?\n\n3:27:15.680 --> 3:27:17.920\n What excites you about that world?\n\n3:27:17.920 --> 3:27:22.920\n Are there certain metrics that excite you more than others?\n\n3:27:25.240 --> 3:27:28.480\n IQ has been a source of,\n\n3:27:31.440 --> 3:27:36.120\n I don't know, I'm not sure IQ as a measure,\n\n3:27:36.120 --> 3:27:40.880\n flawed as it is, has been used to celebrate\n\n3:27:40.880 --> 3:27:43.680\n the successes of the human species\n\n3:27:43.680 --> 3:27:47.120\n nearly as much as has been used to divide people,\n\n3:27:47.120 --> 3:27:49.560\n to say negative things about people,\n\n3:27:51.680 --> 3:27:54.120\n to make negative claims about people.\n\n3:27:54.120 --> 3:27:57.040\n And in that same way, it seems like\n\n3:27:57.040 --> 3:28:01.480\n when there's a selection, a genetic selection based on IQ,\n\n3:28:01.480 --> 3:28:05.160\n you can start now having classes of citizenry,\n\n3:28:05.160 --> 3:28:09.920\n like further divide, you know, the rich get richer.\n\n3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:12.120\n You know, it'll be very rich people\n\n3:28:12.120 --> 3:28:16.440\n that'll be able to do kind of fine selection of IQ\n\n3:28:16.440 --> 3:28:21.440\n and they will start forming these classes\n\n3:28:22.040 --> 3:28:23.960\n of super intelligent people.\n\n3:28:23.960 --> 3:28:26.320\n And those super intelligent people in their minds\n\n3:28:26.320 --> 3:28:27.760\n would of course be the right people\n\n3:28:27.760 --> 3:28:30.560\n to be making global authoritarian decisions\n\n3:28:30.560 --> 3:28:33.960\n about everybody else, all the usual aspects of human nature,\n\n3:28:33.960 --> 3:28:38.280\n but now magnified with the new tools of technology.\n\n3:28:38.280 --> 3:28:42.480\n Anyway, all that to say is what's exciting to you?\n\n3:28:42.480 --> 3:28:44.280\n What's concerning to you?\n\n3:28:44.280 --> 3:28:48.880\n It's a great question and just stepping into the IQ,\n\n3:28:48.880 --> 3:28:51.880\n we'll call it a quagmire for now,\n\n3:28:51.880 --> 3:28:56.880\n it raises a lot of big issues which are complicated.\n\n3:28:57.600 --> 3:29:02.200\n Maybe you've listened to Sam Harris's interview\n\n3:29:02.200 --> 3:29:05.000\n with Charles Murray and then that spawned\n\n3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:10.000\n kind of a whole industry of debate.\n\n3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:13.320\n So first, just the background of IQ\n\n3:29:13.320 --> 3:29:16.400\n and it's from the early 20th century\n\n3:29:16.400 --> 3:29:19.080\n and there was the idea that we can measure\n\n3:29:19.080 --> 3:29:21.200\n people's general intelligence\n\n3:29:21.200 --> 3:29:23.700\n and there are so many different kinds of intelligence.\n\n3:29:23.700 --> 3:29:25.640\n This was measuring a specific thing.\n\n3:29:25.640 --> 3:29:30.400\n So my feeling is that IQ is not a perfect measure\n\n3:29:30.400 --> 3:29:33.400\n of intelligence, but it's a perfect measure of IQ.\n\n3:29:33.400 --> 3:29:35.440\n Like it's measuring what it's measuring,\n\n3:29:35.440 --> 3:29:40.000\n but that thing correlates to a lot of things\n\n3:29:40.000 --> 3:29:43.440\n which are rewarded in our society.\n\n3:29:43.440 --> 3:29:47.680\n So every study of IQ has shown that people\n\n3:29:47.680 --> 3:29:51.080\n with higher IQs, they make more money,\n\n3:29:51.080 --> 3:29:53.920\n they live longer, they have more stable relationships.\n\n3:29:53.920 --> 3:29:56.600\n I mean, that could be something in the testing,\n\n3:29:56.600 --> 3:30:00.560\n but as Sam Harris has talked about a lot,\n\n3:30:00.560 --> 3:30:03.840\n you could line up all of these kind of IQ\n\n3:30:03.840 --> 3:30:07.160\n and IQ like tests correlate with each other.\n\n3:30:07.160 --> 3:30:10.280\n So the people who score high on one, score high on all\n\n3:30:10.280 --> 3:30:15.040\n of them and people think that IQ tests are like a thing\n\n3:30:15.040 --> 3:30:18.800\n like the Earl of Dorchester is coming for dinner.\n\n3:30:18.800 --> 3:30:21.320\n Does he have two forks or three forks\n\n3:30:21.320 --> 3:30:22.160\n or something like that?\n\n3:30:22.160 --> 3:30:24.420\n It's not that a lot of them are things\n\n3:30:24.420 --> 3:30:27.820\n that I think a lot of us would recognize are relevant.\n\n3:30:27.820 --> 3:30:30.640\n Just like how much stuff can you memorize?\n\n3:30:30.640 --> 3:30:33.560\n If you see some shapes, how can you position them\n\n3:30:33.560 --> 3:30:36.000\n and things like that.\n\n3:30:36.000 --> 3:30:38.720\n And so IQ, I mean, it really hit its stride\n\n3:30:38.720 --> 3:30:40.720\n and certainly in the second world war\n\n3:30:40.720 --> 3:30:43.560\n when our governments were processing a lot of people\n\n3:30:43.560 --> 3:30:47.080\n and trying to figure out who to put in what jobs.\n\n3:30:47.080 --> 3:30:48.840\n So that's the starting point.\n\n3:30:48.840 --> 3:30:51.940\n Let me start first with the negatives.\n\n3:30:53.000 --> 3:30:56.680\n That our societies, when we talk about diversity\n\n3:30:56.680 --> 3:31:00.440\n in Darwinian terms, it's not like diversity\n\n3:31:00.440 --> 3:31:01.920\n is from Darwinian terms.\n\n3:31:01.920 --> 3:31:05.840\n Oh, wouldn't it be nice if we have some moths\n\n3:31:05.840 --> 3:31:08.300\n of different colors because it'll be really fun\n\n3:31:08.300 --> 3:31:10.120\n to have different colored moths.\n\n3:31:10.120 --> 3:31:14.680\n Diversity is the sole survival strategy of our species\n\n3:31:14.680 --> 3:31:15.920\n and of every species.\n\n3:31:15.920 --> 3:31:20.920\n And it's impossible to predict what diversity\n\n3:31:21.100 --> 3:31:22.880\n is going to be rewarded.\n\n3:31:22.880 --> 3:31:25.380\n And I've said this before, if you went down\n\n3:31:25.380 --> 3:31:29.560\n and you spoke T. rex and you spoke to the dinosaurs\n\n3:31:29.560 --> 3:31:31.840\n and said, hey, you can select your kids,\n\n3:31:31.840 --> 3:31:33.380\n what criteria do you want?\n\n3:31:33.380 --> 3:31:37.560\n And they say, oh, yeah, sharp teeth, cruel fangs,\n\n3:31:37.560 --> 3:31:41.220\n roar, whatever it is that makes you a great T. rex.\n\n3:31:42.380 --> 3:31:46.240\n But the answer from an evolutionary perspective,\n\n3:31:46.240 --> 3:31:48.200\n from an earth perspective was, oh, it's much better\n\n3:31:48.200 --> 3:31:50.800\n to be like a cockroach or an alligator\n\n3:31:50.800 --> 3:31:53.640\n or some little nothing or a little shrew\n\n3:31:54.640 --> 3:31:57.440\n because the dinosaurs are gonna get wiped out\n\n3:31:57.440 --> 3:31:58.840\n when the asteroid hits.\n\n3:31:58.840 --> 3:32:01.900\n And so there's no better or worse in evolution.\n\n3:32:01.900 --> 3:32:05.800\n There's just better or worse suited for a given environment.\n\n3:32:05.800 --> 3:32:07.640\n And when that environment changes,\n\n3:32:07.640 --> 3:32:11.600\n the best suited person from the old system\n\n3:32:11.600 --> 3:32:14.040\n could be the worst suited person for the new one.\n\n3:32:14.040 --> 3:32:17.060\n So if we start selecting for the things\n\n3:32:17.060 --> 3:32:21.720\n that we value the most, including things like IQ,\n\n3:32:21.720 --> 3:32:26.320\n but even disease resistance, I mean, this is well known,\n\n3:32:26.320 --> 3:32:31.320\n but people who are recessive carrier of sickle cell disease\n\n3:32:32.240 --> 3:32:34.160\n have increased resistance to malaria,\n\n3:32:34.160 --> 3:32:37.480\n which is the biggest reason why that trait\n\n3:32:37.480 --> 3:32:41.400\n hasn't just disappeared given how deadly\n\n3:32:41.400 --> 3:32:43.040\n sickle cell disease is.\n\n3:32:43.880 --> 3:32:46.080\n Biology is incredibly complex.\n\n3:32:46.080 --> 3:32:49.360\n We understand such a tiny percentage of it\n\n3:32:49.360 --> 3:32:50.960\n that we need to have, in your words,\n\n3:32:50.960 --> 3:32:53.880\n just a level of humility.\n\n3:32:53.880 --> 3:32:56.520\n There are huge equity issues as you've articulated.\n\n3:32:56.520 --> 3:32:59.720\n Let's just say that it is the case that in our society,\n\n3:32:59.720 --> 3:33:04.720\n IQ and IQ like traits are highly rewarded.\n\n3:33:05.080 --> 3:33:08.120\n There is an equity issue, but it works in both ways.\n\n3:33:08.120 --> 3:33:11.120\n Because my guess is, let's just say that we had a society\n\n3:33:11.120 --> 3:33:13.400\n where we were doing genome sequencing\n\n3:33:13.400 --> 3:33:15.360\n of everybody who was born.\n\n3:33:15.360 --> 3:33:18.740\n And we had some predictive model to predict IQ.\n\n3:33:18.740 --> 3:33:22.360\n And we had decided as a society that IQ\n\n3:33:22.360 --> 3:33:24.320\n was going to be what we were going to select for.\n\n3:33:24.320 --> 3:33:26.240\n We were gonna put the highest IQ people\n\n3:33:26.240 --> 3:33:28.640\n in these different roles.\n\n3:33:28.640 --> 3:33:31.520\n I guarantee you the people in those roles\n\n3:33:31.520 --> 3:33:36.000\n would not be the people who are legacy admissions to Harvard.\n\n3:33:36.000 --> 3:33:40.800\n They would very likely be people who are born in slums,\n\n3:33:40.800 --> 3:33:44.080\n people who are born with no opportunity or in refugee camps\n\n3:33:44.080 --> 3:33:49.080\n who are just wasting away because we've thrown them away.\n\n3:33:49.080 --> 3:33:54.080\n And so it's an easy, like it's the idea of just being able\n\n3:33:54.880 --> 3:33:57.920\n to look under the hood of our humanity\n\n3:33:57.920 --> 3:34:01.520\n is really scary for everybody.\n\n3:34:01.520 --> 3:34:02.360\n And it should be.\n\n3:34:02.360 --> 3:34:05.400\n I mean, I'm also an Ashkenazi Jew.\n\n3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:07.360\n My father was born in Austria.\n\n3:34:07.360 --> 3:34:10.400\n My father and grandparents came here as refugees.\n\n3:34:10.400 --> 3:34:14.120\n After the war, most of that side of the family was killed.\n\n3:34:14.120 --> 3:34:19.120\n So I get what it means to be on the other,\n\n3:34:19.120 --> 3:34:19.960\n I mean, you said you're reading Mein Kampf,\n\n3:34:19.960 --> 3:34:22.120\n on the other side of the story when someone said,\n\n3:34:22.120 --> 3:34:25.240\n well, here's what's good and you're not good.\n\n3:34:25.240 --> 3:34:29.080\n And therefore you're, so I totally get that.\n\n3:34:29.080 --> 3:34:34.080\n Having said that, I do believe that we're moving toward\n\n3:34:35.080 --> 3:34:37.640\n a new way of procreating.\n\n3:34:37.640 --> 3:34:40.680\n And we're going to have to decide what are the values\n\n3:34:40.680 --> 3:34:45.120\n that we would like to realize through that process?\n\n3:34:45.120 --> 3:34:48.240\n Is it randomness, which is what we currently have now,\n\n3:34:48.240 --> 3:34:49.760\n which is not totally random\n\n3:34:49.760 --> 3:34:52.040\n because we have a sort of mating through colleges\n\n3:34:52.040 --> 3:34:54.120\n and other things.\n\n3:34:54.120 --> 3:34:54.960\n But if it's.\n\n3:34:54.960 --> 3:34:55.800\n Wait, mating through what?\n\n3:34:55.800 --> 3:34:56.640\n Colleges?\n\n3:34:56.640 --> 3:35:01.320\n Sort of like if you go, if you go to Harvard or whatever,\n\n3:35:01.320 --> 3:35:05.040\n and your wife also goes to Harvard, it's like, it's.\n\n3:35:05.040 --> 3:35:07.880\n So it's location based mating.\n\n3:35:07.880 --> 3:35:09.800\n Well, it's not location, it's selection.\n\n3:35:09.800 --> 3:35:11.760\n It's like there are selections that are made\n\n3:35:11.760 --> 3:35:14.400\n about who gets to a certain place.\n\n3:35:14.400 --> 3:35:17.360\n And when like, it's like Harvard admissions is a filter.\n\n3:35:17.360 --> 3:35:19.600\n So we're going to have to decide what are the values\n\n3:35:19.600 --> 3:35:21.400\n that we want to realize through this process\n\n3:35:21.400 --> 3:35:24.880\n because diversity has, it's just baked into our biology.\n\n3:35:24.880 --> 3:35:28.360\n We're the first species ever that has the opportunity\n\n3:35:28.360 --> 3:35:32.360\n to make choices about things that were otherwise baked\n\n3:35:32.360 --> 3:35:33.720\n into our biology.\n\n3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:37.520\n And there's a real danger that if we make bad choices,\n\n3:35:37.520 --> 3:35:40.880\n even with good intentions, it could even drive us\n\n3:35:40.880 --> 3:35:45.120\n toward extinction and certainly undermine our humanity.\n\n3:35:45.120 --> 3:35:47.200\n And that's why I always say, and like I said,\n\n3:35:47.200 --> 3:35:50.160\n I'm deeply involved with WHO and other things,\n\n3:35:50.160 --> 3:35:53.040\n that these aren't conversations about science.\n\n3:35:53.040 --> 3:35:54.040\n They're conversations.\n\n3:35:54.040 --> 3:35:56.160\n Science brings us to the conversation,\n\n3:35:56.160 --> 3:35:58.280\n but the conversation is about values and ethics.\n\n3:35:58.280 --> 3:36:00.480\n As you described, that world is wide open.\n\n3:36:00.480 --> 3:36:04.920\n It's not even a subtly different world.\n\n3:36:04.920 --> 3:36:06.640\n That world is fundamentally different\n\n3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:09.720\n from anything we understand about life on Earth\n\n3:36:09.720 --> 3:36:14.720\n because natural selection, this random process,\n\n3:36:15.080 --> 3:36:17.800\n is so fundamental how we think about life.\n\n3:36:18.920 --> 3:36:22.360\n Being able to program, I mean, it has a chance to,\n\n3:36:23.360 --> 3:36:25.840\n I mean, it'll probably make my question\n\n3:36:25.840 --> 3:36:29.880\n about the ethical concerns around IQ based selection\n\n3:36:29.880 --> 3:36:34.880\n just meaningless because it'll change the nature of identity.\n\n3:36:37.960 --> 3:36:40.760\n It's possible it will dissolve identity\n\n3:36:41.760 --> 3:36:45.680\n because we take so much pride in all the different\n\n3:36:45.680 --> 3:36:47.760\n characteristics that make us who we are.\n\n3:36:48.640 --> 3:36:51.960\n Whenever you have some control over those characteristics,\n\n3:36:51.960 --> 3:36:54.160\n those characteristics start losing meaning.\n\n3:36:55.200 --> 3:36:58.600\n And what may start gaining meaning is the ideas\n\n3:36:58.600 --> 3:37:00.600\n inside our heads, for example,\n\n3:37:00.600 --> 3:37:05.600\n versus like the details of like,\n\n3:37:05.760 --> 3:37:10.680\n is it a Commodore 64, is it a PC, is it a Mac?\n\n3:37:10.680 --> 3:37:12.760\n It's gonna be less important than the software\n\n3:37:12.760 --> 3:37:14.280\n that runs on it.\n\n3:37:14.280 --> 3:37:17.080\n So we can more and more be operating in the digital space\n\n3:37:17.080 --> 3:37:18.400\n and the identity could be something\n\n3:37:18.400 --> 3:37:20.360\n that borrows multiple bodies.\n\n3:37:20.360 --> 3:37:24.760\n Like the legacy of our ideas may become more important\n\n3:37:24.760 --> 3:37:28.480\n than the details of our physical embodiment.\n\n3:37:28.480 --> 3:37:30.440\n Like it, I mean, I'm saying perhaps\n\n3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:33.720\n ridiculous sounding things, but the point is\n\n3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:38.040\n it will bring up so many new ethical concerns\n\n3:37:38.040 --> 3:37:40.160\n that our narrow minded thinking about\n\n3:37:40.160 --> 3:37:43.720\n the current ethical concerns would not apply.\n\n3:37:43.720 --> 3:37:46.200\n So it's, but it's important to think about\n\n3:37:46.200 --> 3:37:49.160\n all this kind of stuff, like actively.\n\n3:37:49.160 --> 3:37:51.560\n What are the right conversations to be having now?\n\n3:37:51.560 --> 3:37:56.200\n Because it feels like it's an ongoing conversation\n\n3:37:56.200 --> 3:37:59.680\n that then continually evolves, like with NIH involved.\n\n3:37:59.680 --> 3:38:03.400\n Like do you do experiments with animals?\n\n3:38:03.400 --> 3:38:06.200\n Do you build these brain organoids?\n\n3:38:06.200 --> 3:38:08.320\n Do you, like through that process you described\n\n3:38:08.320 --> 3:38:10.640\n with the stem cells, like do you experiment\n\n3:38:10.640 --> 3:38:15.640\n with a bunch of organisms to see how genetic material,\n\n3:38:16.040 --> 3:38:18.080\n what form that actually takes,\n\n3:38:18.080 --> 3:38:19.520\n how to minimize the chance of cancer\n\n3:38:19.520 --> 3:38:20.480\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n3:38:20.480 --> 3:38:22.640\n What are the negative consequences of that?\n\n3:38:22.640 --> 3:38:24.840\n What are the positive consequences?\n\n3:38:24.840 --> 3:38:26.920\n Yeah, it's a fascinating world.\n\n3:38:26.920 --> 3:38:28.240\n It's a really fascinating world.\n\n3:38:28.240 --> 3:38:29.720\n Yeah, and then, but those conversations\n\n3:38:29.720 --> 3:38:32.200\n are just so essential.\n\n3:38:32.200 --> 3:38:34.280\n Like we have to be talking about ethics.\n\n3:38:34.280 --> 3:38:37.400\n And then that raises the question of who is the we?\n\n3:38:37.400 --> 3:38:39.800\n And coming back to your conversation\n\n3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:41.960\n about science communication,\n\n3:38:41.960 --> 3:38:44.120\n maybe there was a time earlier\n\n3:38:44.120 --> 3:38:46.440\n when these conversations needed to be,\n\n3:38:46.440 --> 3:38:49.360\n were held among a small number of experts\n\n3:38:49.360 --> 3:38:53.120\n who made decisions on behalf of everybody else.\n\n3:38:53.120 --> 3:38:54.800\n But what we're talking about here\n\n3:38:54.800 --> 3:38:57.080\n is really the future of our species.\n\n3:38:57.080 --> 3:39:01.120\n And I think that conversation is too important\n\n3:39:01.120 --> 3:39:04.960\n to be left just to experts and government officials.\n\n3:39:04.960 --> 3:39:06.840\n So I mentioned that I'm a member,\n\n3:39:06.840 --> 3:39:09.040\n we just ended our work after two years\n\n3:39:09.040 --> 3:39:11.560\n of the World Health Organization Expert Advisory Committee\n\n3:39:11.560 --> 3:39:13.200\n on Human Genome Editing.\n\n3:39:13.200 --> 3:39:16.440\n And my big push in that process\n\n3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:21.080\n was to have education, engagement and empowerment\n\n3:39:21.080 --> 3:39:23.040\n of the broad public to bring,\n\n3:39:23.040 --> 3:39:25.920\n not just bring people into the conversation\n\n3:39:25.920 --> 3:39:29.240\n with the tools to be able to engage,\n\n3:39:29.240 --> 3:39:31.880\n but also into the decision making process.\n\n3:39:31.880 --> 3:39:33.680\n And that's, it's a real shift.\n\n3:39:33.680 --> 3:39:35.920\n And there are countries that are doing it\n\n3:39:35.920 --> 3:39:37.120\n better than others.\n\n3:39:37.120 --> 3:39:39.560\n I mean, Denmark is obviously a much smaller country\n\n3:39:39.560 --> 3:39:40.800\n than the United States,\n\n3:39:40.800 --> 3:39:44.320\n but they have a really well developed infrastructure\n\n3:39:44.320 --> 3:39:46.360\n for public engagement\n\n3:39:46.360 --> 3:39:49.040\n around really complicated scientific issues.\n\n3:39:49.040 --> 3:39:50.960\n And I just think that we have to,\n\n3:39:50.960 --> 3:39:53.400\n like it's great that we have Twitter\n\n3:39:53.400 --> 3:39:55.120\n and all these other things,\n\n3:39:55.120 --> 3:39:58.440\n but we need structured conversations\n\n3:39:58.440 --> 3:40:00.480\n where we can really bring people together\n\n3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:02.360\n and listen to each other,\n\n3:40:02.360 --> 3:40:05.200\n which feels like it's harder than ever.\n\n3:40:06.360 --> 3:40:08.360\n But even now in this process\n\n3:40:08.360 --> 3:40:11.320\n where all these people are shouting at each other,\n\n3:40:11.320 --> 3:40:12.800\n at least there are a bunch of people\n\n3:40:12.800 --> 3:40:14.520\n who are in the conversation.\n\n3:40:14.520 --> 3:40:16.520\n So it's, we have a foundation,\n\n3:40:16.520 --> 3:40:20.400\n but we just really need to do more work.\n\n3:40:20.400 --> 3:40:21.760\n And again, and again, and again,\n\n3:40:21.760 --> 3:40:24.880\n it's about ethics and values\n\n3:40:24.880 --> 3:40:27.200\n because we're at an age,\n\n3:40:27.200 --> 3:40:28.760\n and this has become a cliche\n\n3:40:28.760 --> 3:40:31.360\n of exponential technological change.\n\n3:40:31.360 --> 3:40:35.440\n And so the rate of change is faster going forward\n\n3:40:35.440 --> 3:40:36.640\n than it has been in the past.\n\n3:40:36.640 --> 3:40:39.000\n So in our minds, we underappreciate\n\n3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:43.520\n how quickly things are changing and will change.\n\n3:40:43.520 --> 3:40:44.600\n And if we're not careful,\n\n3:40:44.600 --> 3:40:48.640\n if we don't know who we are and what our values are,\n\n3:40:48.640 --> 3:40:49.760\n we're going to get lost.\n\n3:40:49.760 --> 3:40:52.240\n And we don't have to know technology.\n\n3:40:52.240 --> 3:40:53.720\n We have to know who we are.\n\n3:40:53.720 --> 3:40:58.720\n I mean, our values are hard won over thousands of years.\n\n3:40:58.880 --> 3:41:01.040\n No matter how new the technology is,\n\n3:41:01.040 --> 3:41:04.440\n we shouldn't and can't jettison our values\n\n3:41:04.440 --> 3:41:08.360\n because that is our primary navigational tool.\n\n3:41:08.360 --> 3:41:09.760\n Absurd question.\n\n3:41:09.760 --> 3:41:14.760\n Because we were saying that sexual reproduction\n\n3:41:15.440 --> 3:41:17.800\n is not the best way to define the offspring.\n\n3:41:17.800 --> 3:41:21.440\n You think there'll be a day when humans stop having sex?\n\n3:41:21.440 --> 3:41:23.240\n I don't think we'll stop having sex\n\n3:41:23.240 --> 3:41:25.520\n because it's so enjoyable,\n\n3:41:26.400 --> 3:41:30.880\n but we may significantly stop having sex for reproduction.\n\n3:41:30.880 --> 3:41:35.080\n Even today, most human sex is not for making babies.\n\n3:41:35.080 --> 3:41:36.200\n It's for other things,\n\n3:41:36.200 --> 3:41:40.800\n whether it's pleasure or love or pair bonding or whatever.\n\n3:41:40.800 --> 3:41:41.640\n Intimacy.\n\n3:41:41.640 --> 3:41:42.480\n Intimacy.\n\n3:41:42.480 --> 3:41:44.440\n I mean, some people do it for intimacy.\n\n3:41:44.440 --> 3:41:46.960\n Some people do it for pleasure with strangers.\n\n3:41:46.960 --> 3:41:48.880\n I feel like the people that do it for pleasure,\n\n3:41:48.880 --> 3:41:50.920\n I feel like there will be better ways\n\n3:41:50.920 --> 3:41:54.640\n to achieve that same chemical pleasure, right?\n\n3:41:54.640 --> 3:41:57.560\n You know, there's just so many different kinds of people.\n\n3:41:57.560 --> 3:42:00.040\n I just saw this on television,\n\n3:42:00.040 --> 3:42:02.640\n but there are people who put on those big bunny outfits\n\n3:42:02.640 --> 3:42:04.320\n and go and have sex with other people.\n\n3:42:04.320 --> 3:42:06.640\n I mean, there's just like an unlimited number\n\n3:42:06.640 --> 3:42:07.960\n of different kinds of people.\n\n3:42:07.960 --> 3:42:09.480\n I think they're called,\n\n3:42:09.480 --> 3:42:10.960\n so I remember hearing about this,\n\n3:42:10.960 --> 3:42:14.080\n I think Dan Savage is a podcast.\n\n3:42:14.080 --> 3:42:16.680\n I think they're called Furries.\n\n3:42:16.680 --> 3:42:17.520\n Furries.\n\n3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:18.360\n Furries.\n\n3:42:18.360 --> 3:42:19.200\n Furry parties.\n\n3:42:19.200 --> 3:42:20.040\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n3:42:20.040 --> 3:42:20.880\n So they're just...\n\n3:42:20.880 --> 3:42:21.720\n I love people.\n\n3:42:21.720 --> 3:42:24.440\n Yeah, well, that's like the thing.\n\n3:42:24.440 --> 3:42:25.760\n It's like, whenever you hear these words,\n\n3:42:25.760 --> 3:42:27.320\n it's like, humans.\n\n3:42:27.320 --> 3:42:28.160\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n3:42:28.160 --> 3:42:30.000\n What will they think of next?\n\n3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:31.160\n So, but I do think that,\n\n3:42:31.160 --> 3:42:33.760\n and I write about this in Hacking Darwin,\n\n3:42:33.760 --> 3:42:38.760\n that as people come to believe that having,\n\n3:42:39.680 --> 3:42:43.000\n that making children through the application of science\n\n3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:46.080\n is safer and more beneficial\n\n3:42:46.080 --> 3:42:48.760\n than having children through sex,\n\n3:42:48.760 --> 3:42:52.120\n we'll start to see a shift over time\n\n3:42:52.120 --> 3:42:54.400\n toward reproduction through science.\n\n3:42:54.400 --> 3:42:58.760\n We'll still have sex for all the same great reasons\n\n3:42:58.760 --> 3:43:00.400\n that we do it now,\n\n3:43:00.400 --> 3:43:03.360\n it's just reproduction less and less through the act of sex.\n\n3:43:04.720 --> 3:43:07.040\n Man, it's such a fascinating future.\n\n3:43:08.360 --> 3:43:11.160\n Because as somebody, I value flaws.\n\n3:43:11.160 --> 3:43:16.160\n I think it's the good will hunting,\n\n3:43:17.120 --> 3:43:18.520\n that's the good stuff.\n\n3:43:18.520 --> 3:43:21.880\n The flaws, the weird quirks of humans,\n\n3:43:21.880 --> 3:43:25.360\n that's what makes us who we are, the weird.\n\n3:43:25.360 --> 3:43:26.640\n The weird is the beautiful.\n\n3:43:26.640 --> 3:43:31.640\n And I, there's a fear of optimization that I...\n\n3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:33.840\n You should have it.\n\n3:43:33.840 --> 3:43:35.440\n I mean, it's very healthy.\n\n3:43:35.440 --> 3:43:36.800\n And I think that's, I was saying before,\n\n3:43:36.800 --> 3:43:39.880\n that's the danger of all of this selection\n\n3:43:39.880 --> 3:43:44.320\n is that we make selections just based on social norms\n\n3:43:44.320 --> 3:43:47.440\n that are so deeply internal\n\n3:43:47.440 --> 3:43:51.120\n that they feel like they're eternal truths.\n\n3:43:51.120 --> 3:43:54.520\n And so we talked about selecting for IQ.\n\n3:43:54.520 --> 3:43:56.760\n What about selecting for a kind heart?\n\n3:43:56.760 --> 3:43:57.760\n Like there are lots of them.\n\n3:43:57.760 --> 3:43:59.480\n You talked about Hitler and Mein Kampf.\n\n3:43:59.480 --> 3:44:03.040\n Hitler had certainly had a high IQ,\n\n3:44:03.040 --> 3:44:05.040\n I guess is higher than average IQ.\n\n3:44:06.120 --> 3:44:07.920\n If we just select,\n\n3:44:07.920 --> 3:44:11.000\n I mean, that's why I was saying before,\n\n3:44:11.000 --> 3:44:13.440\n diversity is baked into our biology.\n\n3:44:13.440 --> 3:44:16.080\n But the key lesson, and I've said this many times before,\n\n3:44:16.080 --> 3:44:18.960\n the key lesson of this moment in our history\n\n3:44:18.960 --> 3:44:22.680\n is that after nearly 4 billion years of evolution,\n\n3:44:22.680 --> 3:44:26.280\n our one species suddenly has the unique\n\n3:44:26.280 --> 3:44:28.040\n and increasing ability to read, write,\n\n3:44:28.040 --> 3:44:30.200\n and hack the code of life.\n\n3:44:30.200 --> 3:44:34.080\n And so as we apply these godlike powers\n\n3:44:34.080 --> 3:44:37.960\n that we've now assumed for ourselves,\n\n3:44:37.960 --> 3:44:39.840\n we better be pretty careful\n\n3:44:39.840 --> 3:44:44.120\n because it's so easy to make mistakes,\n\n3:44:44.120 --> 3:44:47.080\n particularly mistakes that are guided\n\n3:44:47.080 --> 3:44:48.480\n by our best intentions.\n\n3:44:49.640 --> 3:44:52.160\n To jump briefly back onto lab leak,\n\n3:44:52.160 --> 3:44:54.160\n and I swear there's a reason for that,\n\n3:44:55.680 --> 3:44:58.200\n what did you think about the Jon Stewart,\n\n3:44:59.200 --> 3:45:02.440\n this moment, I forget when it was, maybe a few months ago,\n\n3:45:02.440 --> 3:45:05.200\n in the summer, I think, of 2021,\n\n3:45:05.200 --> 3:45:07.880\n where he went on Colbert Report,\n\n3:45:07.880 --> 3:45:09.320\n or not the Colbert Report, sorry,\n\n3:45:09.320 --> 3:45:13.320\n the Stephen Colbert's, whatever his show is.\n\n3:45:13.320 --> 3:45:15.680\n But again, Jon Stewart reminded us\n\n3:45:15.680 --> 3:45:18.840\n how valuable his wit and brilliance\n\n3:45:18.840 --> 3:45:22.200\n within the humor was for our culture.\n\n3:45:22.200 --> 3:45:24.480\n And so he did this whole bit\n\n3:45:24.480 --> 3:45:27.440\n that highlighted the common sense nature\n\n3:45:27.440 --> 3:45:30.000\n about what was the metaphor he used\n\n3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:33.080\n about the Hershey factory in Pennsylvania.\n\n3:45:33.080 --> 3:45:34.800\n So what'd you think about that whole bit?\n\n3:45:34.800 --> 3:45:36.520\n I loved it.\n\n3:45:36.520 --> 3:45:40.920\n And so not to be overly self referential,\n\n3:45:40.920 --> 3:45:43.160\n but it's hard not to be overly self referential\n\n3:45:43.160 --> 3:45:45.000\n when you're doing a, however long we are,\n\n3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:47.560\n five hour interview about yourself,\n\n3:45:47.560 --> 3:45:50.600\n which it reminds me of when you had Bret Weinstein on,\n\n3:45:50.600 --> 3:45:52.520\n he said, I have no ego,\n\n3:45:52.520 --> 3:45:55.000\n but these 57 people have screwed me over,\n\n3:45:55.000 --> 3:45:56.760\n and I deserve credit.\n\n3:45:56.760 --> 3:45:57.600\n It's hard.\n\n3:45:57.600 --> 3:46:02.600\n So I am a person, I will confess, it's enjoyable.\n\n3:46:02.640 --> 3:46:03.480\n Some people feel different.\n\n3:46:03.480 --> 3:46:06.120\n I kind of like talking about all this stuff\n\n3:46:06.120 --> 3:46:07.880\n and talking, period.\n\n3:46:08.920 --> 3:46:10.480\n So for me, in the earliest,\n\n3:46:10.480 --> 3:46:13.720\n I remember those early days of when the pandemic started,\n\n3:46:13.720 --> 3:46:14.720\n I was just sitting down,\n\n3:46:14.720 --> 3:46:17.120\n it was late January, early February, 2020,\n\n3:46:17.120 --> 3:46:20.040\n and I just was laying out all of the evidence\n\n3:46:20.040 --> 3:46:22.320\n just that I could collect,\n\n3:46:22.320 --> 3:46:26.240\n trying to say, make sense of where does this come from?\n\n3:46:26.240 --> 3:46:28.880\n And it was just logic.\n\n3:46:28.880 --> 3:46:32.920\n I mean, it was all of the things that Jon Stewart said,\n\n3:46:32.920 --> 3:46:36.200\n which in some overly wordy form\n\n3:46:36.200 --> 3:46:38.440\n were all at that time on my website.\n\n3:46:38.440 --> 3:46:42.640\n Like, what are the odds of having this outbreak\n\n3:46:42.640 --> 3:46:45.720\n of a bat coronavirus more than a thousand miles away\n\n3:46:45.720 --> 3:46:48.960\n from where these bats have their natural habitat,\n\n3:46:48.960 --> 3:46:52.320\n where they have this largest collection\n\n3:46:52.320 --> 3:46:54.920\n of these bat coronaviruses in the world,\n\n3:46:54.920 --> 3:46:57.040\n and they're doing all these very aggressive\n\n3:46:58.280 --> 3:47:01.920\n research projects to make them more aggressive.\n\n3:47:01.920 --> 3:47:04.080\n And then you have the outbreak of a virus\n\n3:47:04.080 --> 3:47:07.680\n that's primed for human to human transmission.\n\n3:47:09.400 --> 3:47:12.360\n It was just logic was my first step.\n\n3:47:12.360 --> 3:47:17.320\n And I kept gathering the information.\n\n3:47:17.320 --> 3:47:19.880\n But Jon Stewart distilled that\n\n3:47:19.880 --> 3:47:23.120\n in a way that just everybody got.\n\n3:47:23.120 --> 3:47:26.120\n And I think that, like, I loved it.\n\n3:47:26.120 --> 3:47:28.800\n And I just think that there's a way of reaching people.\n\n3:47:28.800 --> 3:47:31.280\n It's the reason why I write science fiction\n\n3:47:31.280 --> 3:47:34.000\n in addition to thinking and writing about the science\n\n3:47:34.000 --> 3:47:37.440\n is that we kind of have to reach people where they are.\n\n3:47:37.440 --> 3:47:40.160\n And I just thought it was just,\n\n3:47:40.160 --> 3:47:42.480\n there was a lot of depth, I thought,\n\n3:47:42.480 --> 3:47:46.400\n and maybe that's too self serving,\n\n3:47:46.400 --> 3:47:48.560\n but like in the analysis,\n\n3:47:48.560 --> 3:47:53.560\n but he captured that into those things about,\n\n3:47:54.080 --> 3:47:58.760\n it's like the, whatever, the outbreak of chewy goodness\n\n3:47:58.760 --> 3:48:00.240\n near the Hershey factory.\n\n3:48:00.240 --> 3:48:01.720\n I wonder where that came from.\n\n3:48:01.720 --> 3:48:05.000\n Yeah, there's the humor, there's metaphor.\n\n3:48:05.000 --> 3:48:07.760\n Also the, like, sticking with the joke\n\n3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:09.120\n when the audience is,\n\n3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:13.800\n the audience is Stephen Colbert.\n\n3:48:13.800 --> 3:48:16.120\n He was, like, resisting it.\n\n3:48:16.120 --> 3:48:17.600\n He was very uncomfortable with it.\n\n3:48:17.600 --> 3:48:19.960\n Maybe that was part of the bit, I'm not sure,\n\n3:48:19.960 --> 3:48:21.760\n but it didn't look like it.\n\n3:48:21.760 --> 3:48:24.000\n So Stephen in that moment kind of represented\n\n3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:26.560\n the discomfort of the scientific community, I think.\n\n3:48:26.560 --> 3:48:28.640\n It's kind of interesting, that whole dynamic.\n\n3:48:28.640 --> 3:48:31.320\n And I think that was a pivotal moment.\n\n3:48:32.880 --> 3:48:35.560\n That just, like, highlights the value of comedy,\n\n3:48:35.560 --> 3:48:39.920\n the value of, like, when Joe Rogan says,\n\n3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:41.320\n I'm just a comedian.\n\n3:48:42.360 --> 3:48:46.000\n I mean, that's such a funny thing to say.\n\n3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:48.120\n It's like saying I'm just a podcaster\n\n3:48:48.120 --> 3:48:51.760\n or I'm just a writer, I'm just a, you know.\n\n3:48:51.760 --> 3:48:55.920\n That ability in so few words\n\n3:48:55.920 --> 3:48:59.200\n to express what everybody else is thinking,\n\n3:49:00.560 --> 3:49:02.520\n it's so refreshing.\n\n3:49:02.520 --> 3:49:06.320\n And I wish the scientific communicators would do that too.\n\n3:49:06.320 --> 3:49:08.280\n A little humor, a little humor.\n\n3:49:08.280 --> 3:49:10.560\n I mean, that's what I love Elon Musk very much.\n\n3:49:10.560 --> 3:49:13.360\n So, like, the way he communicates is, like,\n\n3:49:13.360 --> 3:49:18.360\n it's so refreshing for a CEO of a major company,\n\n3:49:18.960 --> 3:49:22.520\n several major companies, to just have a sense of humor\n\n3:49:22.520 --> 3:49:24.840\n and say ridiculous shit every once in a while.\n\n3:49:24.840 --> 3:49:26.960\n That's so, there's something to that.\n\n3:49:26.960 --> 3:49:29.560\n Like, it shakes up the whole conversation\n\n3:49:29.560 --> 3:49:33.760\n to where it gives you freedom to, like, think publicly.\n\n3:49:33.760 --> 3:49:36.920\n If you're always trying to say the proper thing,\n\n3:49:36.920 --> 3:49:40.240\n you lose the freedom to think, to reason out,\n\n3:49:40.240 --> 3:49:42.720\n to be authentic and genuine.\n\n3:49:42.720 --> 3:49:44.960\n When you allow yourself the freedom\n\n3:49:44.960 --> 3:49:48.000\n to regularly say stupid shit,\n\n3:49:48.000 --> 3:49:51.680\n have fun, make fun of yourself,\n\n3:49:51.680 --> 3:49:53.120\n I think you give yourself freedom\n\n3:49:53.120 --> 3:49:55.760\n to really be a great scientist.\n\n3:49:55.760 --> 3:49:58.960\n Honestly, I think scientists have a lot to learn\n\n3:49:58.960 --> 3:50:00.080\n from comedians.\n\n3:50:00.080 --> 3:50:00.920\n Well, for sure.\n\n3:50:00.920 --> 3:50:05.360\n I think we all do about just distilling and communicating\n\n3:50:05.360 --> 3:50:07.280\n in ways that people can hear.\n\n3:50:07.280 --> 3:50:10.440\n Like, a lot of us say things and people just can't hear them\n\n3:50:10.440 --> 3:50:12.040\n either because of the way we're saying them\n\n3:50:12.040 --> 3:50:14.440\n or where they are, but.\n\n3:50:14.440 --> 3:50:19.360\n And like I said before, I'm a big fan of Joe Rogan.\n\n3:50:19.360 --> 3:50:20.880\n I've been on his show twice.\n\n3:50:20.880 --> 3:50:25.400\n And when Francis Collins was in his conversation with you,\n\n3:50:25.400 --> 3:50:27.840\n he said, which I think makes sense,\n\n3:50:27.840 --> 3:50:31.000\n is that when somebody has that kind of platform\n\n3:50:31.000 --> 3:50:34.040\n and people rightly or wrongly who follow them\n\n3:50:34.040 --> 3:50:36.960\n and look to them for guidance,\n\n3:50:36.960 --> 3:50:40.760\n I do think that there is some responsibility\n\n3:50:40.760 --> 3:50:45.000\n for people in those roles to make whatever judgment\n\n3:50:45.000 --> 3:50:47.200\n that they make and to share that.\n\n3:50:47.200 --> 3:50:50.640\n And as I mentioned to you when we were off mic,\n\n3:50:50.640 --> 3:50:53.200\n Sanjay Gupta is a very close friend of mine.\n\n3:50:53.200 --> 3:50:54.840\n We've been friends for many years\n\n3:50:54.840 --> 3:50:58.400\n and I fully supported Sanjay's instinct\n\n3:50:58.400 --> 3:51:02.160\n to go on the Joe Rogan show.\n\n3:51:02.160 --> 3:51:05.200\n I thought it was great.\n\n3:51:05.200 --> 3:51:09.280\n At the end of that whole conversation, Joe said,\n\n3:51:09.280 --> 3:51:12.240\n well, I'm just a comedian, what do I know?\n\n3:51:12.240 --> 3:51:16.440\n And I just felt that, yes, Joe Rogan is a comedian.\n\n3:51:16.440 --> 3:51:20.440\n I wouldn't say just a comedian among other things.\n\n3:51:20.440 --> 3:51:23.720\n But I also felt that he had a responsibility\n\n3:51:23.720 --> 3:51:25.280\n for just saying whatever he believed,\n\n3:51:25.280 --> 3:51:30.040\n even if he believed or believes as I think is the case\n\n3:51:30.040 --> 3:51:32.960\n that ivermectin should be studied more,\n\n3:51:32.960 --> 3:51:34.880\n which I certainly agree.\n\n3:51:34.880 --> 3:51:39.880\n And that healthy people shouldn't get vaccinated,\n\n3:51:40.080 --> 3:51:42.560\n healthy young people, which I don't agree.\n\n3:51:42.560 --> 3:51:44.840\n I just felt at the end of that conversation to say,\n\n3:51:44.840 --> 3:51:47.520\n well, I'm just a comedian, what do I know?\n\n3:51:47.520 --> 3:51:51.960\n I feel like it didn't fully integrate the power\n\n3:51:51.960 --> 3:51:55.200\n that a person like Joe Rogan has to set the agenda.\n\n3:51:55.200 --> 3:51:58.360\n So I think the reason he says I'm just a comedian\n\n3:51:58.360 --> 3:52:00.480\n is the same reason I say I'm an idiot,\n\n3:52:00.480 --> 3:52:02.080\n which I truly believe.\n\n3:52:02.080 --> 3:52:03.800\n I can explain exactly what I mean by that,\n\n3:52:03.800 --> 3:52:08.800\n but it's more for him, or in this case for me,\n\n3:52:09.680 --> 3:52:11.080\n to just keep yourself humble.\n\n3:52:11.080 --> 3:52:14.720\n Because I think it's a slippery slope\n\n3:52:14.720 --> 3:52:16.440\n when you think you have a responsibility\n\n3:52:16.440 --> 3:52:19.680\n to then think you actually have an authority,\n\n3:52:21.000 --> 3:52:22.720\n because a lot of people listen to you,\n\n3:52:22.720 --> 3:52:24.000\n you think you have an authority\n\n3:52:24.000 --> 3:52:26.560\n to actually speak to those people\n\n3:52:26.560 --> 3:52:27.840\n and you have enough authority\n\n3:52:27.840 --> 3:52:29.840\n to know what the hell you're talking about.\n\n3:52:29.840 --> 3:52:31.840\n And I think there's just the humility\n\n3:52:31.840 --> 3:52:34.040\n to just kind of make it fun of yourself\n\n3:52:34.040 --> 3:52:35.800\n that's extremely valuable.\n\n3:52:35.800 --> 3:52:40.200\n And saying I'm just a comedian I think is a reminder\n\n3:52:40.200 --> 3:52:45.200\n to himself that he's often full of shit, so are all of us.\n\n3:52:48.000 --> 3:52:51.200\n And so that's a really powerful way for himself\n\n3:52:51.200 --> 3:52:52.400\n to keep himself humble.\n\n3:52:53.560 --> 3:52:55.600\n I mean, I think that's really useful\n\n3:52:55.600 --> 3:52:57.880\n in some kind of way for people in general\n\n3:52:57.880 --> 3:53:00.720\n to make fun of themselves a little bit,\n\n3:53:00.720 --> 3:53:02.120\n in whatever way that means.\n\n3:53:02.120 --> 3:53:04.960\n And saying I'm just a comedian is just one way to do that.\n\n3:53:04.960 --> 3:53:07.360\n Now that coupled that with the responsibility\n\n3:53:07.360 --> 3:53:10.960\n of doing the research and really having an open mind\n\n3:53:10.960 --> 3:53:12.200\n and all those kinds of stuff,\n\n3:53:12.200 --> 3:53:15.360\n I think that's something Joe does really well\n\n3:53:15.360 --> 3:53:18.320\n on a lot of topics, but he can't do that on everything.\n\n3:53:18.320 --> 3:53:22.240\n And so it's up to people to decide\n\n3:53:22.240 --> 3:53:26.400\n how well he does it on certain topics and not others.\n\n3:53:26.400 --> 3:53:29.120\n But how do you think Sanjay did in that conversation?\n\n3:53:29.120 --> 3:53:31.960\n So I know I'm gonna get myself into trouble here\n\n3:53:31.960 --> 3:53:35.240\n because Sanjay is a very close friend.\n\n3:53:35.240 --> 3:53:38.080\n Joe, my personal interaction with him\n\n3:53:38.080 --> 3:53:39.520\n has been our two interviews,\n\n3:53:39.520 --> 3:53:41.000\n but it's like my interview with now,\n\n3:53:41.000 --> 3:53:43.120\n sit down with somebody for four hours,\n\n3:53:43.120 --> 3:53:48.120\n it's a lot and great and then private communication.\n\n3:53:48.800 --> 3:53:53.800\n So I am personally more sympathetic to the arguments\n\n3:53:53.880 --> 3:53:58.080\n that Sanjay was making or trying to make.\n\n3:53:58.080 --> 3:54:01.000\n I believe that the threat of the virus\n\n3:54:01.000 --> 3:54:03.920\n is greater than the threat of the vaccine.\n\n3:54:03.920 --> 3:54:08.560\n That doesn't mean that we can guarantee 100% safety\n\n3:54:08.560 --> 3:54:09.520\n for the vaccine,\n\n3:54:09.520 --> 3:54:13.360\n but these are really well tolerated vaccines.\n\n3:54:13.360 --> 3:54:15.320\n And we know for all the reasons we've been talking about\n\n3:54:15.320 --> 3:54:18.120\n that this is a really scary virus\n\n3:54:18.120 --> 3:54:20.560\n and particularly the mRNA vaccines,\n\n3:54:20.560 --> 3:54:23.040\n what they're basically doing is getting your body\n\n3:54:23.040 --> 3:54:25.800\n to replicate a tiny little piece of the virus,\n\n3:54:25.800 --> 3:54:29.720\n the spike protein and then your body responds to that.\n\n3:54:29.720 --> 3:54:34.560\n And so that's a much less of an insult to your body\n\n3:54:34.560 --> 3:54:37.040\n than being infected by the virus.\n\n3:54:37.040 --> 3:54:41.080\n So I'm more sympathetic to the people who say,\n\n3:54:41.080 --> 3:54:44.720\n well, everybody should get vaccinated,\n\n3:54:44.720 --> 3:54:47.680\n but people who've already been infected,\n\n3:54:47.680 --> 3:54:52.560\n we should study whether they need to be vaccinated or not.\n\n3:54:52.560 --> 3:54:55.920\n Having said all of that, I felt that\n\n3:54:57.320 --> 3:54:59.600\n that Joe Rogan won the debate.\n\n3:54:59.600 --> 3:55:02.240\n I mean, it was, and the reason that I felt\n\n3:55:02.240 --> 3:55:05.760\n that he won the debate was they were kind of,\n\n3:55:05.760 --> 3:55:08.240\n they had two different categories of arguments.\n\n3:55:08.240 --> 3:55:11.520\n So Sanjay, what he was trying to do,\n\n3:55:11.520 --> 3:55:13.240\n which I totally respect was saying,\n\n3:55:13.240 --> 3:55:15.600\n there's so much animosity between the,\n\n3:55:15.600 --> 3:55:17.640\n on these different sides, let's lower the temperature.\n\n3:55:17.640 --> 3:55:22.560\n Let's model that we can have a respectful dialogue\n\n3:55:22.560 --> 3:55:24.640\n with each other where we can actually listen.\n\n3:55:24.640 --> 3:55:27.120\n And Sanjay, again, I've known him for many years.\n\n3:55:27.120 --> 3:55:30.400\n He's a very empathic, humble,\n\n3:55:30.400 --> 3:55:33.680\n just an all around wonderful human being,\n\n3:55:33.680 --> 3:55:35.760\n and I really love him.\n\n3:55:35.760 --> 3:55:38.400\n And so he was making cases that were based on\n\n3:55:38.400 --> 3:55:41.160\n kind of averages, studies and things like that.\n\n3:55:41.160 --> 3:55:45.720\n And Joe was saying, well, I know a guy whose sister's cousin\n\n3:55:45.720 --> 3:55:48.080\n had this experience.\n\n3:55:48.080 --> 3:55:51.000\n And I'm sure that it's all true in the sense\n\n3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:54.280\n that we have millions of people who are getting vaccinated\n\n3:55:54.280 --> 3:55:56.200\n and different things.\n\n3:55:56.200 --> 3:55:59.120\n And what Sanjay should have said was,\n\n3:55:59.120 --> 3:56:01.360\n I know that's anecdote.\n\n3:56:01.360 --> 3:56:04.440\n Here's another anecdote of like when Francis Collins\n\n3:56:04.440 --> 3:56:07.840\n was with you and he talked about the world wrestling guy\n\n3:56:07.840 --> 3:56:10.280\n who was like 6.6 and a big muscly guy,\n\n3:56:10.280 --> 3:56:12.840\n and then he got COVID and he was anti vaccine,\n\n3:56:12.840 --> 3:56:14.400\n and then he got COVID and almost died.\n\n3:56:14.400 --> 3:56:15.240\n And he said, I'm gonna.\n\n3:56:15.240 --> 3:56:17.920\n By the way, I don't know if you know this part.\n\n3:56:17.920 --> 3:56:18.760\n No.\n\n3:56:18.760 --> 3:56:19.580\n Oh, this is funny.\n\n3:56:19.580 --> 3:56:20.680\n Joe's gonna listen to this.\n\n3:56:20.680 --> 3:56:21.960\n He's gonna be laughing.\n\n3:56:21.960 --> 3:56:24.640\n Does Joe listen like to the four hours of this\n\n3:56:24.640 --> 3:56:28.320\n in addition to the three hours of his interviews every day?\n\n3:56:28.320 --> 3:56:30.800\n No, not every day, but he listens to a lot of these.\n\n3:56:30.800 --> 3:56:31.640\n I love it.\n\n3:56:31.640 --> 3:56:32.460\n And we talk about it.\n\n3:56:32.460 --> 3:56:33.300\n I love it.\n\n3:56:33.300 --> 3:56:34.140\n We argue about it.\n\n3:56:34.140 --> 3:56:34.960\n Hi, Joe.\n\n3:56:34.960 --> 3:56:35.800\n Hey, Joe.\n\n3:56:35.800 --> 3:56:36.640\n We love you, Joe.\n\n3:56:37.560 --> 3:56:40.240\n So that particular case,\n\n3:56:40.240 --> 3:56:43.220\n I don't know why Francis said what he said there,\n\n3:56:43.220 --> 3:56:45.100\n but that's not accurate.\n\n3:56:45.100 --> 3:56:45.960\n Oh, really?\n\n3:56:45.960 --> 3:56:50.800\n So the wrestler never, he didn't almost die.\n\n3:56:50.800 --> 3:56:53.120\n He was no big deal at all for him.\n\n3:56:53.120 --> 3:56:54.480\n And he said that to him.\n\n3:56:54.480 --> 3:56:56.880\n I think, I'm not sure.\n\n3:56:56.880 --> 3:57:00.200\n I think something got mixed up in Francis's memory.\n\n3:57:00.200 --> 3:57:02.320\n There was another case he must've been like,\n\n3:57:02.320 --> 3:57:05.360\n cause I don't imagine he would bring that case up\n\n3:57:05.360 --> 3:57:09.400\n and just like make it up, you know, cause like why?\n\n3:57:09.400 --> 3:57:11.540\n But he, that was not at all,\n\n3:57:11.540 --> 3:57:13.160\n like that was a pretty public case.\n\n3:57:13.160 --> 3:57:16.480\n He had an interview with him, that wrestler,\n\n3:57:16.480 --> 3:57:17.480\n he was just fine.\n\n3:57:17.480 --> 3:57:19.760\n So that anecdotal case, I mean,\n\n3:57:19.760 --> 3:57:21.040\n Francis should not have done that.\n\n3:57:21.040 --> 3:57:24.320\n So if I have any, so I have a bunch of criticism\n\n3:57:24.320 --> 3:57:26.200\n of how that went.\n\n3:57:26.200 --> 3:57:28.680\n People who criticize that interview,\n\n3:57:28.680 --> 3:57:32.320\n I feel like don't give enough respect\n\n3:57:32.320 --> 3:57:33.840\n to the full range of things\n\n3:57:33.840 --> 3:57:35.760\n that Francis Collins has done in his career.\n\n3:57:35.760 --> 3:57:37.400\n He's an incredible scientist.\n\n3:57:37.400 --> 3:57:40.120\n And I also think a really good human being.\n\n3:57:40.120 --> 3:57:44.640\n But yes, that conversation was flawed in many ways.\n\n3:57:44.640 --> 3:57:47.840\n And one of them was why,\n\n3:57:47.840 --> 3:57:52.000\n when you're trying to present some kind of critical,\n\n3:57:53.800 --> 3:57:56.480\n like criticize Joe Rogan,\n\n3:57:56.480 --> 3:57:58.720\n why bring up anecdotal evidence at all?\n\n3:57:58.720 --> 3:58:01.200\n And if you do bring up anecdotal evidence,\n\n3:58:02.040 --> 3:58:04.040\n which is not scientific, if you're a scientist,\n\n3:58:04.040 --> 3:58:06.160\n you should not be using anecdotal evidence.\n\n3:58:06.160 --> 3:58:07.980\n If you do bring it up,\n\n3:58:07.980 --> 3:58:12.400\n why bring up one that's first not true\n\n3:58:12.400 --> 3:58:13.760\n and you know it's not true?\n\n3:58:15.400 --> 3:58:18.600\n So I know, pretend, so you don't know it's not true.\n\n3:58:18.600 --> 3:58:23.200\n So yes, that would find another case where, exactly.\n\n3:58:23.200 --> 3:58:24.840\n So the basic thing coming back\n\n3:58:24.840 --> 3:58:28.080\n to Sanjay and Joe's conversation\n\n3:58:28.080 --> 3:58:31.620\n was that Sanjay was trying to use statistical evidence\n\n3:58:31.620 --> 3:58:33.600\n and Joe was using anecdotal evidence.\n\n3:58:33.600 --> 3:58:36.040\n And so I think that for Sanjay,\n\n3:58:36.040 --> 3:58:39.320\n and there are all kinds of things where there are debates\n\n3:58:39.320 --> 3:58:42.800\n where often the person who's better at debating\n\n3:58:42.800 --> 3:58:46.960\n wins the debate regardless of the topic.\n\n3:58:46.960 --> 3:58:49.560\n So I think what Sanjay could have done,\n\n3:58:49.560 --> 3:58:53.000\n and Sanjay is such a smart guy,\n\n3:58:53.000 --> 3:58:55.920\n is to say, well, that's an anecdote,\n\n3:58:55.920 --> 3:58:57.520\n here's another anecdote.\n\n3:58:57.520 --> 3:59:00.040\n And there are lots of different anecdotes.\n\n3:59:00.040 --> 3:59:03.680\n And there certainly are people who have taken the vaccine\n\n3:59:03.680 --> 3:59:07.120\n and have had problems that could reasonably be traced\n\n3:59:07.120 --> 3:59:08.280\n to the vaccines.\n\n3:59:08.280 --> 3:59:11.200\n And there certainly are lots of people, I would argue,\n\n3:59:11.200 --> 3:59:14.180\n more people who've not had the vaccine,\n\n3:59:14.180 --> 3:59:16.400\n but who've gotten COVID and have either died\n\n3:59:16.400 --> 3:59:19.200\n or our hospitals are now full of people\n\n3:59:19.200 --> 3:59:20.440\n who weren't vaccinated.\n\n3:59:20.440 --> 3:59:23.040\n And in many ways, I mean, our emergency rooms\n\n3:59:23.040 --> 3:59:26.220\n are full of unvaccinated people here in the United States.\n\n3:59:26.220 --> 3:59:28.720\n So I think what Sanjay could have done,\n\n3:59:28.720 --> 3:59:32.920\n but there was a conflict between wanting to kind of\n\n3:59:32.920 --> 3:59:36.840\n win the debate and wanting to take the temperature down.\n\n3:59:36.840 --> 3:59:39.500\n And what he could have done is to say,\n\n3:59:39.500 --> 3:59:42.280\n well, here's an anecdote, I have a counter anecdote\n\n3:59:42.280 --> 3:59:43.680\n and we can go on all day,\n\n3:59:43.680 --> 3:59:46.320\n but here's what the statistics show.\n\n3:59:46.320 --> 3:59:48.480\n And I think that was the thing.\n\n3:59:48.480 --> 3:59:50.360\n So I think it's a healthy conversation.\n\n3:59:50.360 --> 3:59:52.640\n We can't, I mean, there are a lot of people\n\n3:59:52.640 --> 3:59:55.240\n who are afraid of the vaccine.\n\n3:59:55.240 --> 3:59:56.680\n There are a lot of people who don't trust\n\n3:59:56.680 --> 3:59:58.280\n the scientific establishment\n\n3:59:58.280 --> 4:00:00.000\n and lots of them have good reason.\n\n4:00:00.000 --> 4:00:04.520\n I mean, it's not just people think of like Trump Republicans.\n\n4:00:04.520 --> 4:00:08.600\n There are lots of people in the African American community\n\n4:00:08.600 --> 4:00:11.920\n who've had a historical terrible experience\n\n4:00:11.920 --> 4:00:14.400\n with the Tuskegee and all sorts of things.\n\n4:00:14.400 --> 4:00:16.920\n So they don't trust the messages\n\n4:00:16.920 --> 4:00:18.120\n that were being delivered.\n\n4:00:18.120 --> 4:00:21.440\n I live in New York City and we had a piece\n\n4:00:21.440 --> 4:00:23.840\n in the New York Times where in the earliest days\n\n4:00:23.840 --> 4:00:25.920\n of the vaccines, there was this big movement,\n\n4:00:25.920 --> 4:00:28.960\n let's make sure that the poorest people in the city\n\n4:00:28.960 --> 4:00:31.920\n have first access to the vaccines\n\n4:00:31.920 --> 4:00:35.200\n because they're the ones, they have higher density\n\n4:00:35.200 --> 4:00:37.920\n in their homes, they're relying on public transport.\n\n4:00:37.920 --> 4:00:39.400\n So there was this whole liberal effort.\n\n4:00:39.400 --> 4:00:42.440\n And then in the black community in New York,\n\n4:00:42.440 --> 4:00:43.520\n according to the New York Times,\n\n4:00:43.520 --> 4:00:46.320\n there was very low acceptance of the vaccines\n\n4:00:46.320 --> 4:00:48.040\n and they interviewed people in that article.\n\n4:00:48.040 --> 4:00:51.480\n And they said, well, if the white people want us\n\n4:00:51.480 --> 4:00:54.640\n to have it first, there must be something wrong with it.\n\n4:00:54.640 --> 4:00:56.720\n They must be doing something.\n\n4:00:56.720 --> 4:00:59.840\n And so we have to listen to each other.\n\n4:00:59.840 --> 4:01:04.720\n Like I would never, I have a disrespect for everybody.\n\n4:01:04.720 --> 4:01:07.880\n And if somebody is cautious about the vaccine\n\n4:01:07.880 --> 4:01:10.320\n for themselves or for their children,\n\n4:01:10.320 --> 4:01:12.320\n we have to listen to them.\n\n4:01:12.320 --> 4:01:15.960\n At the same time, public health\n\n4:01:15.960 --> 4:01:19.160\n is about creating public health.\n\n4:01:19.160 --> 4:01:23.160\n And there's no doubt, I think Joe was absolutely right\n\n4:01:23.160 --> 4:01:28.160\n that older people, obese people are at greater risk\n\n4:01:28.240 --> 4:01:32.840\n for being harmed or killed by COVID 19\n\n4:01:32.840 --> 4:01:34.560\n than young, healthy people.\n\n4:01:34.560 --> 4:01:38.160\n But by everybody getting vaccinated,\n\n4:01:38.160 --> 4:01:41.240\n we reduce the risk to everybody else.\n\n4:01:41.240 --> 4:01:43.720\n And so I feel like, like with everything,\n\n4:01:43.720 --> 4:01:46.680\n there's the individual benefit argument\n\n4:01:46.680 --> 4:01:49.360\n and then there's the community argument.\n\n4:01:49.360 --> 4:01:50.480\n And I absolutely think our community.\n\n4:01:50.480 --> 4:01:53.320\n Expressing that clearly that there's a difference between\n\n4:01:53.320 --> 4:01:56.400\n the individual health and freedoms\n\n4:01:56.400 --> 4:01:59.160\n and the community health and freedoms\n\n4:01:59.160 --> 4:02:01.920\n and steel manning each side of this.\n\n4:02:01.920 --> 4:02:05.160\n One of the problems that people don't do enough of\n\n4:02:05.160 --> 4:02:08.720\n is be able to, so how do you steel man an argument?\n\n4:02:08.720 --> 4:02:11.560\n You describe that argument in the best possible way.\n\n4:02:12.640 --> 4:02:14.520\n You have to first understand that argument.\n\n4:02:14.520 --> 4:02:17.880\n Let's go to the noncontroversial thing like Flat Earth.\n\n4:02:17.880 --> 4:02:22.880\n Like most people, most colleagues of mine at MIT\n\n4:02:23.800 --> 4:02:28.800\n don't even read about like the full argument\n\n4:02:28.880 --> 4:02:31.080\n that the Flat Earthers make.\n\n4:02:31.080 --> 4:02:36.080\n I feel it's disingenuous for people in the physics community\n\n4:02:37.000 --> 4:02:39.640\n to roll their eyes at Flat Earthers\n\n4:02:39.640 --> 4:02:42.200\n if they haven't read their arguments.\n\n4:02:42.200 --> 4:02:46.120\n You should feel bad that you didn't read their arguments.\n\n4:02:46.120 --> 4:02:50.680\n And like it's the rolling of the eyes that's a big problem.\n\n4:02:50.680 --> 4:02:51.960\n You haven't read it.\n\n4:02:51.960 --> 4:02:55.280\n Your intuition says that these are a bunch of crazy people.\n\n4:02:55.280 --> 4:02:59.480\n Okay, but you haven't earned the right to roll your eyes.\n\n4:02:59.480 --> 4:03:03.640\n You've earned your right to maybe not read it,\n\n4:03:03.640 --> 4:03:05.000\n but then don't have an opinion.\n\n4:03:05.000 --> 4:03:07.720\n Don't roll your eyes, don't do any of that dismissive stuff.\n\n4:03:07.720 --> 4:03:11.200\n And the same thing in the scientific community\n\n4:03:11.200 --> 4:03:14.360\n around COVID and so on, there's often this kind of saying,\n\n4:03:14.360 --> 4:03:17.720\n oh God, that's conspiracy theories, that's misinformation\n\n4:03:17.720 --> 4:03:20.320\n without actually looking into what they're saying.\n\n4:03:20.320 --> 4:03:22.400\n If you haven't looked into what they're saying,\n\n4:03:22.400 --> 4:03:23.880\n then don't talk about it.\n\n4:03:23.880 --> 4:03:26.280\n Like if you're a scientific leader and the communicator,\n\n4:03:26.280 --> 4:03:27.560\n you need to look into it.\n\n4:03:27.560 --> 4:03:28.640\n It's not that much effort.\n\n4:03:28.640 --> 4:03:29.720\n I totally agree.\n\n4:03:29.720 --> 4:03:31.040\n And I think that humility,\n\n4:03:31.040 --> 4:03:35.160\n it's a constant theme of your podcasts and I love that.\n\n4:03:35.160 --> 4:03:39.040\n And so after the conversation debate,\n\n4:03:39.040 --> 4:03:42.960\n whatever it was between Sanjay and Joe,\n\n4:03:42.960 --> 4:03:45.840\n I reached out on Twitter to someone I've never met\n\n4:03:45.840 --> 4:03:47.920\n in person, but I'm in touch privately\n\n4:03:47.920 --> 4:03:49.680\n to a guy named Daniel Griffin,\n\n4:03:49.680 --> 4:03:54.680\n who's a professor at Columbia Medical School\n\n4:03:54.720 --> 4:03:56.160\n and just so smart there.\n\n4:03:56.160 --> 4:04:00.880\n He gives regular updates on COVID 19\n\n4:04:00.880 --> 4:04:03.680\n on a thing called TWIV this week in virology.\n\n4:04:03.680 --> 4:04:08.680\n I'm a critic of TWIV for its coverage of origins.\n\n4:04:09.640 --> 4:04:12.200\n But on this issue, I'm just having regular updates.\n\n4:04:12.200 --> 4:04:13.640\n Daniel is great.\n\n4:04:13.640 --> 4:04:15.480\n And so I said to him,\n\n4:04:15.480 --> 4:04:20.480\n I said, why don't we have an honest process\n\n4:04:20.680 --> 4:04:22.920\n to get the people who are raising concerns\n\n4:04:22.920 --> 4:04:25.680\n about the vaccines in their own words\n\n4:04:25.680 --> 4:04:28.400\n to raise what are their concerns?\n\n4:04:28.400 --> 4:04:32.080\n And then let's do our best job of saying,\n\n4:04:32.080 --> 4:04:34.040\n well, here are these concerns.\n\n4:04:34.040 --> 4:04:38.400\n And then here is our evidence making a counterclaim\n\n4:04:38.400 --> 4:04:41.800\n and here are links to if you want to look at the studies\n\n4:04:41.800 --> 4:04:45.200\n upon which these claims are made, here they are.\n\n4:04:45.200 --> 4:04:47.560\n And Daniel, who's incredibly busy,\n\n4:04:47.560 --> 4:04:51.800\n I mean, he reads every, I mean, it seems every paper\n\n4:04:51.800 --> 4:04:54.560\n that comes out every week and it's unbelievable.\n\n4:04:55.640 --> 4:05:00.560\n But he sent me a link to the CDC Q&A page\n\n4:05:00.560 --> 4:05:02.920\n on the CDC website.\n\n4:05:02.920 --> 4:05:05.800\n And it wasn't that, it was people who were,\n\n4:05:05.800 --> 4:05:07.800\n I mean, it was written by people like me\n\n4:05:07.800 --> 4:05:12.800\n who were convinced in the benefit of these vaccines.\n\n4:05:13.400 --> 4:05:16.920\n So the questions were framed, they were kind of like,\n\n4:05:16.920 --> 4:05:19.720\n they weren't really the framing\n\n4:05:19.720 --> 4:05:21.640\n of the people with the concerns.\n\n4:05:21.640 --> 4:05:22.600\n They were framing of people\n\n4:05:22.600 --> 4:05:25.200\n who were just kind of imagining something else.\n\n4:05:25.200 --> 4:05:27.440\n I mean, you always talk about kind of humility\n\n4:05:27.440 --> 4:05:29.280\n and active listening.\n\n4:05:29.280 --> 4:05:31.800\n I know you don't mean, and it doesn't mean\n\n4:05:31.800 --> 4:05:33.400\n that we don't stand for something.\n\n4:05:33.400 --> 4:05:36.640\n Like I certainly am a strong proponent of vaccines\n\n4:05:36.640 --> 4:05:38.720\n and masks and all of those things.\n\n4:05:39.760 --> 4:05:42.160\n But if we don't hear other people,\n\n4:05:42.160 --> 4:05:47.080\n if we don't let them hear their voice in the conversation,\n\n4:05:47.080 --> 4:05:49.040\n if it's just saying, well, you may think this\n\n4:05:49.040 --> 4:05:52.440\n and here's why it's wrong, the argument may be right.\n\n4:05:52.440 --> 4:05:53.800\n It'll just never break through.\n\n4:05:53.800 --> 4:05:56.200\n By the way, my interpretation of Joe and Sanjay,\n\n4:05:56.200 --> 4:05:58.840\n I listened to that conversation without looking at Twitter\n\n4:05:58.840 --> 4:06:01.960\n or the internet and I thought that was a great conversation\n\n4:06:01.960 --> 4:06:04.680\n and I thought Sanjay actually really succeeded\n\n4:06:04.680 --> 4:06:05.800\n in bringing the temperature down.\n\n4:06:05.800 --> 4:06:08.600\n To me, the goal was bringing the temperature down.\n\n4:06:08.600 --> 4:06:10.120\n I didn't even think of it as a debate.\n\n4:06:10.120 --> 4:06:13.000\n I was like, oh, cool, this isn't gonna be some weird,\n\n4:06:13.000 --> 4:06:15.200\n it's like two friendly people talking.\n\n4:06:15.200 --> 4:06:16.840\n And then I look at the internet\n\n4:06:16.840 --> 4:06:20.200\n and then the internet says, Joe Rogan slammed Sanjay\n\n4:06:20.200 --> 4:06:24.520\n like as if it was a heated debate that Joe won.\n\n4:06:24.520 --> 4:06:26.040\n And it's like, all right,\n\n4:06:26.040 --> 4:06:30.080\n it's really the temperature being brought down.\n\n4:06:30.080 --> 4:06:32.080\n Real conversation between two humans.\n\n4:06:32.080 --> 4:06:34.160\n That wasn't really a debate.\n\n4:06:34.160 --> 4:06:38.480\n It was just a conversation and that was a success.\n\n4:06:38.480 --> 4:06:40.960\n I definitely think it was a success,\n\n4:06:40.960 --> 4:06:45.960\n but I also felt that a takeaway,\n\n4:06:47.720 --> 4:06:51.440\n and again, because this is something that I don't agree with,\n\n4:06:51.440 --> 4:06:54.360\n even though I have great, as I've said, respect for Joe,\n\n4:06:54.360 --> 4:06:58.320\n I think a reasonable person listening to that conversation\n\n4:06:58.320 --> 4:07:00.680\n would come away with the conclusion\n\n4:07:00.680 --> 4:07:05.120\n that all in all these vaccines are a good thing,\n\n4:07:05.120 --> 4:07:10.120\n but if you're young and healthy, you probably don't need it.\n\n4:07:11.000 --> 4:07:16.000\n And I just felt that there was a stronger case to be made,\n\n4:07:16.200 --> 4:07:17.440\n even though Sanjay made it.\n\n4:07:17.440 --> 4:07:19.400\n It wasn't that Sanjay didn't make it.\n\n4:07:19.400 --> 4:07:22.160\n It was just that in the flow of that conversation,\n\n4:07:22.160 --> 4:07:26.120\n I felt that the case for the vaccines\n\n4:07:26.120 --> 4:07:28.960\n and the vaccines both as an individual choice\n\n4:07:28.960 --> 4:07:31.000\n and then certainly again, as I said before,\n\n4:07:31.000 --> 4:07:34.960\n I think that while people can be afraid of the vaccines,\n\n4:07:34.960 --> 4:07:37.560\n the virus itself is much scarier\n\n4:07:37.560 --> 4:07:40.760\n and we're seeing it now in real time\n\n4:07:40.760 --> 4:07:43.840\n with these variations and variants.\n\n4:07:43.840 --> 4:07:47.680\n I just felt that that was kind of the rough takeaway\n\n4:07:47.680 --> 4:07:49.440\n from that conversation.\n\n4:07:50.760 --> 4:07:54.120\n And I felt that Sanjay, again, whom I love,\n\n4:07:54.120 --> 4:07:56.760\n I felt it could have made his case a little bit stronger.\n\n4:07:56.760 --> 4:08:00.200\n So the thing he succeeded is he didn't come off\n\n4:08:00.200 --> 4:08:05.200\n as like a science expert looking down at everybody,\n\n4:08:07.120 --> 4:08:09.120\n talking down to everybody.\n\n4:08:09.120 --> 4:08:12.000\n So he succeeded in that, which is very respectful.\n\n4:08:12.000 --> 4:08:15.240\n But I also think sort of making the case\n\n4:08:15.240 --> 4:08:19.240\n for taking the vaccine when you're a young, healthy person,\n\n4:08:19.240 --> 4:08:22.040\n when you're sitting across from Joe Rogan\n\n4:08:22.040 --> 4:08:26.080\n is like a high difficulty on the video game level.\n\n4:08:26.080 --> 4:08:26.920\n For sure.\n\n4:08:26.920 --> 4:08:30.200\n So it's difficult to do.\n\n4:08:30.200 --> 4:08:31.520\n Yeah, for sure. It's difficult to do.\n\n4:08:31.520 --> 4:08:32.840\n And also it's difficult to do\n\n4:08:32.840 --> 4:08:37.840\n because it's not as simple as like, look at the data.\n\n4:08:38.960 --> 4:08:42.840\n There's a lot of data to go through here.\n\n4:08:42.840 --> 4:08:45.720\n And there's also a lot of non data stuff,\n\n4:08:45.720 --> 4:08:48.600\n like the fact that, first of all,\n\n4:08:48.600 --> 4:08:50.120\n questioning the sources of the data,\n\n4:08:50.120 --> 4:08:51.680\n the quality of the data,\n\n4:08:51.680 --> 4:08:54.040\n because it's also disappointing about COVID\n\n4:08:54.040 --> 4:08:56.440\n is that the quality of the data is not great.\n\n4:08:56.440 --> 4:09:00.640\n But also questioning all the motivations\n\n4:09:00.640 --> 4:09:02.520\n of the different parties involved,\n\n4:09:02.520 --> 4:09:04.280\n whether it's major organizations\n\n4:09:04.280 --> 4:09:05.400\n that developed the vaccine,\n\n4:09:05.400 --> 4:09:09.920\n whether it's major institutions like NIH or NIAID\n\n4:09:09.920 --> 4:09:12.520\n that are sort of communicating to us about the vaccine,\n\n4:09:12.520 --> 4:09:15.640\n whether it's the CDC and the WHO,\n\n4:09:15.640 --> 4:09:18.180\n whether it's the Biden or the Trump administration,\n\n4:09:18.180 --> 4:09:20.320\n whether it's China and all those kinds of things,\n\n4:09:20.320 --> 4:09:24.160\n you have to, that's part of the conversation here.\n\n4:09:24.160 --> 4:09:28.760\n I mean, vaccination is not just a public health tool.\n\n4:09:28.760 --> 4:09:30.480\n It's also a tool for a government\n\n4:09:30.480 --> 4:09:33.480\n to gain more control over the populace.\n\n4:09:33.480 --> 4:09:36.320\n Like, there's a lot of truth to that too.\n\n4:09:36.320 --> 4:09:38.220\n Things that have a lot of benefit\n\n4:09:40.040 --> 4:09:44.280\n can also be used as a Trojan horse\n\n4:09:44.280 --> 4:09:47.320\n to increase bureaucracy and control.\n\n4:09:47.320 --> 4:09:49.960\n But that has to be on the table for a conversation.\n\n4:09:49.960 --> 4:09:52.080\n I think it has to be on the conversation.\n\n4:09:52.080 --> 4:09:56.640\n But your parents, when they were in the Soviet Union\n\n4:09:56.640 --> 4:09:57.920\n and here in the United States,\n\n4:09:57.920 --> 4:09:59.600\n and actually it was a big collaboration\n\n4:09:59.600 --> 4:10:02.160\n between US and Soviet Union,\n\n4:10:02.160 --> 4:10:04.200\n when the polio vaccine came out,\n\n4:10:04.200 --> 4:10:06.160\n there were people all around the world\n\n4:10:06.160 --> 4:10:08.400\n who had a different life trajectory,\n\n4:10:08.400 --> 4:10:09.900\n no longer living in fear.\n\n4:10:09.900 --> 4:10:11.880\n And all of these people who were paralyzed\n\n4:10:11.880 --> 4:10:15.960\n or killed from polio, smallpox has been eradicated.\n\n4:10:15.960 --> 4:10:20.280\n It was one of the great successes in human history.\n\n4:10:20.280 --> 4:10:23.320\n And while it for sure is true that you could imagine\n\n4:10:23.320 --> 4:10:27.800\n some kind of fraudulent vaccination effort,\n\n4:10:27.800 --> 4:10:30.040\n but here I genuinely think,\n\n4:10:30.040 --> 4:10:33.200\n I mean, whatever the number, 15 million, 16 million\n\n4:10:33.200 --> 4:10:37.080\n is the economist number of dead from COVID 19,\n\n4:10:37.080 --> 4:10:39.800\n many, many, many more people would be dead\n\n4:10:39.800 --> 4:10:41.780\n but for these vaccines.\n\n4:10:41.780 --> 4:10:44.360\n And so I get that any activity\n\n4:10:44.360 --> 4:10:47.720\n that needs to be coordinated by a central government\n\n4:10:47.720 --> 4:10:50.680\n has the potential to increase bureaucracy\n\n4:10:50.680 --> 4:10:53.640\n and increase control.\n\n4:10:53.640 --> 4:10:57.900\n But there are certain things that central governments do,\n\n4:10:57.900 --> 4:11:00.880\n like the development, particularly these mRNA vaccines,\n\n4:11:00.880 --> 4:11:05.080\n which it's purely a US government victory.\n\n4:11:05.080 --> 4:11:08.020\n I mean, it was huge DARPA funding\n\n4:11:08.020 --> 4:11:11.040\n and then the National Institute for Allergy\n\n4:11:11.040 --> 4:11:13.540\n and Infectious Disease, NIH funding.\n\n4:11:13.540 --> 4:11:17.080\n I mean, this was a public private partnership throughout\n\n4:11:17.080 --> 4:11:21.120\n and that we got a working vaccine 11 months was a miracle.\n\n4:11:21.120 --> 4:11:21.960\n So I, yeah.\n\n4:11:21.960 --> 4:11:23.300\n It's not purely a victory.\n\n4:11:24.320 --> 4:11:26.160\n Again, you have to be open minded.\n\n4:11:26.160 --> 4:11:30.400\n I'm with you here playing a bit of devil's advocate,\n\n4:11:30.400 --> 4:11:32.640\n but the people who discuss any viral drugs\n\n4:11:32.640 --> 4:11:34.840\n like ivermectin and other alternatives\n\n4:11:34.840 --> 4:11:38.120\n would say that the extreme focus on the vaccine\n\n4:11:39.040 --> 4:11:42.120\n distracted us from considering other possibilities.\n\n4:11:42.120 --> 4:11:46.080\n And saying that this is purely a success\n\n4:11:46.080 --> 4:11:48.080\n is distracting from the story\n\n4:11:48.080 --> 4:11:50.660\n that there could have been other solutions.\n\n4:11:50.660 --> 4:11:52.400\n So yes, it's a huge success\n\n4:11:52.400 --> 4:11:55.080\n that the vaccine was developed so quickly\n\n4:11:55.980 --> 4:12:00.660\n and surprisingly way more effective than it was hoped for.\n\n4:12:02.200 --> 4:12:04.520\n But there could have been other solutions\n\n4:12:04.520 --> 4:12:08.040\n and they completely distracted from us from that.\n\n4:12:08.040 --> 4:12:11.640\n In fact, it distracted us from looking into a bunch of things\n\n4:12:11.640 --> 4:12:12.960\n like the lab leak.\n\n4:12:12.960 --> 4:12:15.720\n And so it's not a pure victory.\n\n4:12:15.720 --> 4:12:18.160\n And there's a lot of people that criticize\n\n4:12:18.160 --> 4:12:20.680\n the overreach of government and all of this.\n\n4:12:20.680 --> 4:12:23.480\n That one of the things that makes the United States great\n\n4:12:24.480 --> 4:12:29.480\n is the individualism and the hesitancy to ideas of mandates.\n\n4:12:31.560 --> 4:12:35.180\n Even if the mandates on mass will have a positive,\n\n4:12:35.180 --> 4:12:37.320\n even strongly positive result,\n\n4:12:37.320 --> 4:12:42.320\n many Americans will still say no.\n\n4:12:43.000 --> 4:12:46.840\n Because in the long arc of history,\n\n4:12:46.840 --> 4:12:49.740\n saying no in that moment will actually lead\n\n4:12:49.740 --> 4:12:53.680\n to a better country and a better world.\n\n4:12:53.680 --> 4:12:57.360\n So that's a messed up aspect of America,\n\n4:12:57.360 --> 4:12:59.960\n but it's also a beautiful part.\n\n4:12:59.960 --> 4:13:03.900\n We're skeptical even about good things.\n\n4:13:03.900 --> 4:13:08.280\n I agree and certainly we should all be cautious\n\n4:13:08.280 --> 4:13:11.560\n about government overreach, absolutely.\n\n4:13:11.560 --> 4:13:14.560\n And it happens in all kinds of scenarios\n\n4:13:14.560 --> 4:13:17.400\n with incarceration with a thousand things.\n\n4:13:17.400 --> 4:13:21.000\n And we also should be afraid of government underreach\n\n4:13:21.000 --> 4:13:24.060\n that if there is a problem that could be solved\n\n4:13:24.060 --> 4:13:26.120\n by governments and that's why we have governments\n\n4:13:26.120 --> 4:13:28.200\n in the first place is that there's just certain things\n\n4:13:28.200 --> 4:13:31.100\n that individuals can't do on their own.\n\n4:13:31.100 --> 4:13:34.000\n And that's why we pool our resources\n\n4:13:34.000 --> 4:13:38.200\n and we, in some ways, sacrifice our rights\n\n4:13:38.200 --> 4:13:39.160\n for this common thing.\n\n4:13:39.160 --> 4:13:41.200\n And that's why we don't have, hopefully,\n\n4:13:41.200 --> 4:13:42.960\n people, murderers marauding\n\n4:13:42.960 --> 4:13:45.480\n or people driving 200 miles down the street.\n\n4:13:45.480 --> 4:13:49.880\n We have a process for arriving at a set of common rules.\n\n4:13:49.880 --> 4:13:52.720\n And so, while I fully agree that we need to respect\n\n4:13:52.720 --> 4:13:56.440\n and we need to listen, we need to find that right balance.\n\n4:13:56.440 --> 4:14:00.020\n And you've raised the magic I word, ivermectin.\n\n4:14:00.020 --> 4:14:05.020\n And so, an ivermectin, like my view has always been,\n\n4:14:06.340 --> 4:14:09.620\n ivermectin could be effective, it could not be effective.\n\n4:14:09.620 --> 4:14:12.080\n Let's study it through a full process.\n\n4:14:12.080 --> 4:14:14.420\n And when you had Francis Collins with you,\n\n4:14:14.420 --> 4:14:19.420\n even while he was making up stories about this wrestler,\n\n4:14:19.900 --> 4:14:22.140\n he was saying, yeah, exactly.\n\n4:14:22.140 --> 4:14:25.180\n But he was saying that they're going to do\n\n4:14:25.180 --> 4:14:28.520\n a full randomized highest level trial of ivermectin.\n\n4:14:28.520 --> 4:14:30.140\n And if ivermectin works,\n\n4:14:30.140 --> 4:14:32.780\n then that's another tool in our toolbox.\n\n4:14:32.780 --> 4:14:34.020\n And I think we should.\n\n4:14:34.020 --> 4:14:37.760\n And I think that Sanjay was absolutely correct\n\n4:14:37.760 --> 4:14:40.700\n to concede the point to Joe,\n\n4:14:40.700 --> 4:14:43.180\n that it was disingenuous for people,\n\n4:14:43.180 --> 4:14:45.220\n including people on CNN,\n\n4:14:45.220 --> 4:14:48.980\n to say that ivermectin is for livestock.\n\n4:14:48.980 --> 4:14:52.380\n And so, I definitely think that we have to,\n\n4:14:53.260 --> 4:14:55.500\n like we have to have some kind of process\n\n4:14:55.500 --> 4:14:57.540\n that allows us to come together.\n\n4:14:57.540 --> 4:15:01.860\n And I totally agree that the great strength of America\n\n4:15:01.860 --> 4:15:03.480\n is that we empower individuals.\n\n4:15:03.480 --> 4:15:06.900\n It's the history of our frontier mentality in our country.\n\n4:15:06.900 --> 4:15:11.460\n So we, I 100% agree that we have to allow that,\n\n4:15:11.460 --> 4:15:15.580\n even if sometimes it creates messy processes\n\n4:15:15.580 --> 4:15:18.380\n and uncomfortable feelings and all those sorts of things.\n\n4:15:19.940 --> 4:15:22.660\n You are an ultra marathon runner.\n\n4:15:22.660 --> 4:15:23.500\n Yes.\n\n4:15:23.500 --> 4:15:27.180\n What are you running from?\n\n4:15:27.180 --> 4:15:28.020\n No.\n\n4:15:28.020 --> 4:15:30.660\n It's the right, it's the funny thing is,\n\n4:15:30.660 --> 4:15:34.180\n so I'm an ultra marathoner and I've done 13 Ironmans.\n\n4:15:34.180 --> 4:15:36.300\n And people say, oh my God, that's amazing.\n\n4:15:36.300 --> 4:15:37.140\n 13 Ironmans.\n\n4:15:37.140 --> 4:15:41.060\n And what I always say, no, one Ironman is impressive.\n\n4:15:41.060 --> 4:15:44.340\n 13 Ironmans, there's something effing wrong with you.\n\n4:15:44.340 --> 4:15:45.740\n We just need to figure out what it is.\n\n4:15:45.740 --> 4:15:48.500\n Yeah, there's some demons you're trying to work through.\n\n4:15:48.500 --> 4:15:49.980\n I mean, well, you're doing the work though.\n\n4:15:49.980 --> 4:15:53.980\n Most people just kind of let the demons sit in the attic.\n\n4:15:53.980 --> 4:15:57.260\n No, what have you learned about yourself,\n\n4:15:57.260 --> 4:16:00.260\n about your mind, about your body, about life,\n\n4:16:00.260 --> 4:16:05.260\n from taking your body limit in that kind of way\n\n4:16:05.380 --> 4:16:07.020\n to running those kinds of distances?\n\n4:16:07.020 --> 4:16:08.220\n Well, it's a great question.\n\n4:16:08.220 --> 4:16:10.140\n And I know that you are also kind of exploring\n\n4:16:10.140 --> 4:16:12.540\n the limits of the physical.\n\n4:16:12.540 --> 4:16:17.260\n And so for me in doing the Ironmans and the ultra marathons,\n\n4:16:17.260 --> 4:16:20.420\n it's always the same kind of lesson,\n\n4:16:20.420 --> 4:16:25.420\n which is just when you think you have nothing left,\n\n4:16:25.540 --> 4:16:27.900\n you actually have a ton left.\n\n4:16:27.900 --> 4:16:31.180\n There are a lot of resources that are there\n\n4:16:31.180 --> 4:16:32.860\n if you call on them.\n\n4:16:32.860 --> 4:16:37.860\n And the ability to call on them has to be cultivated.\n\n4:16:38.580 --> 4:16:42.420\n And so for me, especially in the Ironman,\n\n4:16:42.420 --> 4:16:45.900\n and Ironman in many ways is harder than the ultra marathons\n\n4:16:45.900 --> 4:16:48.180\n because I'll be at, I mean, it's 140 miles.\n\n4:16:48.180 --> 4:16:52.900\n I'll be at a 100 mile, 120, having done the swim\n\n4:16:52.900 --> 4:16:55.180\n and then the bike and I'll be whatever,\n\n4:16:56.100 --> 4:16:58.420\n six miles into the run.\n\n4:16:58.420 --> 4:17:01.420\n And I'll think, I feel like shit.\n\n4:17:01.420 --> 4:17:02.940\n I have nothing left.\n\n4:17:02.940 --> 4:17:07.740\n How am I possibly gonna run 20 miles more?\n\n4:17:07.740 --> 4:17:10.580\n But there's always more.\n\n4:17:10.580 --> 4:17:15.500\n And I think that for me, these extreme sports\n\n4:17:15.500 --> 4:17:20.500\n are my process of exploring what's possible.\n\n4:17:21.100 --> 4:17:25.220\n And I feel like it applies in so many different areas\n\n4:17:25.220 --> 4:17:28.140\n of life where you're kind of pushing\n\n4:17:28.140 --> 4:17:30.540\n and it feels like the limit.\n\n4:17:30.540 --> 4:17:33.140\n And one of my friend of mine,\n\n4:17:33.140 --> 4:17:35.820\n who I just have so much respect for,\n\n4:17:35.820 --> 4:17:37.300\n who actually be a great guest\n\n4:17:37.300 --> 4:17:41.300\n if you haven't already interviewed him is Charlie Angle.\n\n4:17:41.300 --> 4:17:44.180\n And Charlie, he was a drug addict.\n\n4:17:44.180 --> 4:17:47.220\n He was in prison, his life was total shit.\n\n4:17:48.140 --> 4:17:50.940\n And somehow, and I can't remember the full story,\n\n4:17:50.940 --> 4:17:55.660\n he just started running around the prison yard.\n\n4:17:55.660 --> 4:17:56.500\n And it's like Forrest Gump.\n\n4:17:56.500 --> 4:17:59.220\n And he just kept running and running.\n\n4:17:59.220 --> 4:18:02.380\n And then he got out of prison and he kept running\n\n4:18:02.380 --> 4:18:04.820\n and he started doing ultra marathons,\n\n4:18:04.820 --> 4:18:07.660\n started inspiring all these other people.\n\n4:18:07.660 --> 4:18:09.060\n Now he's written all these books.\n\n4:18:09.060 --> 4:18:12.500\n As a matter of fact, we just spoke a few months ago\n\n4:18:12.500 --> 4:18:17.500\n that he's planning on running from the Dead Sea\n\n4:18:18.140 --> 4:18:20.420\n to somehow to the top of Mount Everest,\n\n4:18:20.420 --> 4:18:23.500\n from the lowest point to the highest point on earth.\n\n4:18:23.500 --> 4:18:25.980\n And I said, well, why are you stopping there?\n\n4:18:25.980 --> 4:18:29.420\n Why don't you get whatever camera in\n\n4:18:29.420 --> 4:18:32.220\n and go down to the lowest part of the ocean,\n\n4:18:32.220 --> 4:18:34.020\n go to the lowest part of the ocean\n\n4:18:34.020 --> 4:18:38.260\n and then talk to Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos\n\n4:18:38.260 --> 4:18:40.220\n and go to the kind of the highest place\n\n4:18:40.220 --> 4:18:42.180\n than the stratosphere you can get.\n\n4:18:42.180 --> 4:18:44.700\n But it's this thing of possibility.\n\n4:18:44.700 --> 4:18:49.140\n And I just feel like so many of us and myself included,\n\n4:18:49.140 --> 4:18:54.140\n we get stuck in a sense of what we think is our range.\n\n4:18:54.620 --> 4:18:57.820\n And if we're not careful, that can become our range.\n\n4:18:57.820 --> 4:19:00.900\n And that's why for me in all of life,\n\n4:19:00.900 --> 4:19:02.500\n it's all about like we've been talking about,\n\n4:19:02.500 --> 4:19:06.260\n challenging the limits, challenging assumptions,\n\n4:19:06.260 --> 4:19:09.540\n challenging ourselves and hopefully,\n\n4:19:09.540 --> 4:19:12.940\n we do it in a way that kind of doesn't hurt anybody.\n\n4:19:12.940 --> 4:19:15.900\n When I'm at the Ironman, they have all these little kids\n\n4:19:15.900 --> 4:19:17.060\n and they'll have these little shirts\n\n4:19:17.060 --> 4:19:19.220\n and it'll say like, my dad is a hero\n\n4:19:19.220 --> 4:19:21.060\n and have the little Ironman logo.\n\n4:19:21.060 --> 4:19:22.860\n And I wanna say, it's like, no,\n\n4:19:22.860 --> 4:19:25.300\n your dad is actually a narcissistic dick\n\n4:19:25.300 --> 4:19:29.540\n who goes on eight mile bike rides every Sunday\n\n4:19:29.540 --> 4:19:31.540\n rather than spend time with you.\n\n4:19:31.540 --> 4:19:34.020\n And so we shouldn't hurt anybody.\n\n4:19:34.020 --> 4:19:38.700\n But for me, and also I just find it very enjoyable\n\n4:19:38.700 --> 4:19:41.340\n and I hope I'm not disclosing too much\n\n4:19:41.340 --> 4:19:44.060\n about our conversation before we went live\n\n4:19:44.060 --> 4:19:46.020\n where you're doing so many different things\n\n4:19:46.020 --> 4:19:48.740\n with running and your martial arts.\n\n4:19:48.740 --> 4:19:53.620\n And I encouraged you to do ultra marathons\n\n4:19:53.620 --> 4:19:55.220\n because there's so many great ones in Texas.\n\n4:19:55.220 --> 4:19:58.900\n It's actually surprisingly a very enjoyable way\n\n4:19:58.900 --> 4:19:59.740\n to spend a day.\n\n4:19:59.740 --> 4:20:01.100\n Like how would you recommend?\n\n4:20:01.100 --> 4:20:03.420\n So yeah, for people who might not know,\n\n4:20:03.420 --> 4:20:05.060\n I've never actually even run a marathon.\n\n4:20:05.060 --> 4:20:08.420\n I've run 22 miles in one time at most.\n\n4:20:08.420 --> 4:20:13.420\n I did a four by four by 48 challenge with David Goggins\n\n4:20:13.860 --> 4:20:16.340\n where you run four miles every four hours.\n\n4:20:16.340 --> 4:20:19.380\n Is it different as less to do with the distance\n\n4:20:19.380 --> 4:20:21.620\n and more to do with the sleep deprivation.\n\n4:20:21.620 --> 4:20:24.220\n What advice would you give to a first time ultra marathon\n\n4:20:24.220 --> 4:20:27.180\n or like me trying to run 50 or more miles\n\n4:20:27.180 --> 4:20:30.260\n or for anybody else interested\n\n4:20:30.260 --> 4:20:32.340\n in this kind of exploration of their range?\n\n4:20:32.340 --> 4:20:36.940\n What I always tell is the same advice is register.\n\n4:20:36.940 --> 4:20:39.540\n Pick your timeline of when you think you can be ready.\n\n4:20:39.540 --> 4:20:41.140\n Make it, depending on where you are now,\n\n4:20:41.140 --> 4:20:43.100\n make it six months, make a year,\n\n4:20:43.100 --> 4:20:45.300\n and then register for the race.\n\n4:20:45.300 --> 4:20:47.060\n And then once you're registered,\n\n4:20:47.060 --> 4:20:49.820\n just work back from there, what's it going to take?\n\n4:20:49.820 --> 4:20:52.780\n But one of the things for people who are just getting going,\n\n4:20:52.780 --> 4:20:53.980\n you really do need to make sure\n\n4:20:53.980 --> 4:20:55.940\n that your body is ready for it.\n\n4:20:55.940 --> 4:20:59.100\n And so particularly, and particularly as we get older,\n\n4:20:59.100 --> 4:21:02.660\n strengthening is really important.\n\n4:21:02.660 --> 4:21:06.260\n So I'll do a plug for my brother, Jordan Metzl.\n\n4:21:06.260 --> 4:21:08.380\n He's a doctor at hospital for special surgery,\n\n4:21:08.380 --> 4:21:10.740\n but his whole thing is functional strength.\n\n4:21:10.740 --> 4:21:12.740\n And so, and people know about,\n\n4:21:12.740 --> 4:21:15.140\n and you can actually even go to his website.\n\n4:21:15.140 --> 4:21:17.420\n You can just Google Jordan Metzl Iron Strength,\n\n4:21:17.420 --> 4:21:19.180\n but it's all about like burpees\n\n4:21:19.180 --> 4:21:21.380\n and just building your muscular strength\n\n4:21:21.380 --> 4:21:25.060\n so that you don't get injured as you increase.\n\n4:21:25.060 --> 4:21:27.740\n And then just increase your mileage with,\n\n4:21:27.740 --> 4:21:31.340\n in some steady way, make sure that you take rest days\n\n4:21:31.340 --> 4:21:34.540\n and listen to your body because people like you\n\n4:21:34.540 --> 4:21:37.140\n who are just very kind of mind over matter,\n\n4:21:37.140 --> 4:21:39.460\n like you were telling me before about you have an injury,\n\n4:21:39.460 --> 4:21:41.780\n but you kind of run a little bit differently.\n\n4:21:41.780 --> 4:21:44.420\n And we need to listen to our bodies\n\n4:21:44.420 --> 4:21:47.660\n because our bodies are communicating.\n\n4:21:48.980 --> 4:21:53.460\n But I think it was kind of little by little magic is possible.\n\n4:21:53.460 --> 4:21:54.780\n And what I will say is,\n\n4:21:54.780 --> 4:21:58.300\n and I also have done lots and lots of marathons,\n\n4:21:58.300 --> 4:22:01.620\n and I always tell people that the ultra marathons,\n\n4:22:01.620 --> 4:22:02.540\n at least the ones that I do,\n\n4:22:02.540 --> 4:22:04.100\n and I shouldn't misrepresent myself.\n\n4:22:04.100 --> 4:22:07.540\n I mean, there are people who do 500 mile races.\n\n4:22:07.540 --> 4:22:11.220\n The ones that I do are 50K mountain trail runs,\n\n4:22:11.220 --> 4:22:12.620\n which is 32 miles.\n\n4:22:12.620 --> 4:22:17.620\n So I do the kind of the easier side of ultras,\n\n4:22:17.900 --> 4:22:19.820\n but it's actually much easier than a marathon\n\n4:22:19.820 --> 4:22:21.940\n because some of the mountain ones,\n\n4:22:21.940 --> 4:22:25.540\n sometimes it's so steep that you can't,\n\n4:22:25.540 --> 4:22:26.900\n you have to walk it\n\n4:22:26.900 --> 4:22:29.180\n because walking is faster than running.\n\n4:22:29.180 --> 4:22:32.140\n And every four or five miles in the supported races,\n\n4:22:32.140 --> 4:22:35.500\n you stop and eat blintzes and foiled potatoes.\n\n4:22:35.500 --> 4:22:36.820\n It's actually quite enjoyable.\n\n4:22:36.820 --> 4:22:41.200\n But as I started to tell you before we went live,\n\n4:22:42.100 --> 4:22:43.860\n so I've done for lots of years,\n\n4:22:43.860 --> 4:22:45.540\n these 50K mountain trail runs,\n\n4:22:45.540 --> 4:22:48.220\n and I was going to Taiwan a number of years ago\n\n4:22:48.220 --> 4:22:49.300\n for something else.\n\n4:22:49.300 --> 4:22:50.860\n And I thought, well, wouldn't it be fun\n\n4:22:50.860 --> 4:22:53.020\n to do an ultra marathon in Taiwan?\n\n4:22:53.020 --> 4:22:56.940\n I looked and that the weekend after my visit,\n\n4:22:56.940 --> 4:22:57.940\n there was a marathon.\n\n4:22:57.940 --> 4:22:59.060\n It was called the,\n\n4:22:59.060 --> 4:23:01.820\n every ultra marathon, it was called the Taiwan Beast.\n\n4:23:01.820 --> 4:23:03.980\n And I figured, oh, beasts, what are they talking about?\n\n4:23:03.980 --> 4:23:05.180\n It's 50K mountain trail,\n\n4:23:05.180 --> 4:23:06.580\n and I've done a million of them.\n\n4:23:06.580 --> 4:23:07.840\n And then I went to register.\n\n4:23:07.840 --> 4:23:09.300\n And then as part of registration,\n\n4:23:09.300 --> 4:23:11.500\n they said, you need to have all of this equipment.\n\n4:23:11.500 --> 4:23:14.940\n And it was all this like wilderness survival equipment.\n\n4:23:14.940 --> 4:23:17.460\n And I was thinking, God, these Taiwanese,\n\n4:23:17.460 --> 4:23:18.940\n but what a bunch of wimps.\n\n4:23:18.940 --> 4:23:22.340\n You have to carry, give me a break, 50K mountain trail.\n\n4:23:22.340 --> 4:23:24.500\n So I get there and the race starts\n\n4:23:24.500 --> 4:23:27.540\n at like 4.30 in the morning in the middle of nowhere.\n\n4:23:27.540 --> 4:23:28.620\n And you have to wear headlamps\n\n4:23:28.620 --> 4:23:29.820\n and everyone's carrying all this stuff.\n\n4:23:29.820 --> 4:23:34.820\n And you kind of go running out into the rainforest.\n\n4:23:34.820 --> 4:23:36.740\n It was the hardest thing I've ever done in my,\n\n4:23:36.740 --> 4:23:38.180\n it took 19 hours.\n\n4:23:38.180 --> 4:23:41.540\n There were maybe 15 cliff faces, like a real cliff.\n\n4:23:41.540 --> 4:23:44.500\n And somebody had dangled like a little piece of string.\n\n4:23:44.500 --> 4:23:46.900\n And so you had to hold onto the string with one hand\n\n4:23:46.900 --> 4:23:49.380\n while it was in the pouring rain, climb up these cliffs.\n\n4:23:49.380 --> 4:23:52.740\n There were maybe 20 river crossings,\n\n4:23:52.740 --> 4:23:57.100\n but not just like a little stream, like a torrential river.\n\n4:23:57.100 --> 4:24:00.140\n There were some things where it was so steep\n\n4:24:00.140 --> 4:24:02.060\n that everyone was just climbing up\n\n4:24:02.060 --> 4:24:03.980\n and then you'd slide all the way down and climb up.\n\n4:24:03.980 --> 4:24:07.060\n And there were people who I met on the way out there\n\n4:24:07.060 --> 4:24:07.900\n who were saying, oh yeah,\n\n4:24:07.900 --> 4:24:11.540\n I did the Sahara 500 kilometer race.\n\n4:24:11.540 --> 4:24:15.220\n And those people were just sprawled out.\n\n4:24:15.220 --> 4:24:17.460\n A lot of them didn't finish.\n\n4:24:17.460 --> 4:24:19.780\n So that was the hardest thing I've ever.\n\n4:24:19.780 --> 4:24:22.060\n So how do you get through something like that?\n\n4:24:22.060 --> 4:24:23.600\n You just, one step at a time?\n\n4:24:23.600 --> 4:24:26.380\n Was there, do you remember, is there a?\n\n4:24:26.380 --> 4:24:27.220\n Yeah.\n\n4:24:27.220 --> 4:24:28.500\n Is there a dark moments\n\n4:24:28.500 --> 4:24:31.140\n or is it kind of all spread out thinly?\n\n4:24:31.140 --> 4:24:34.100\n It wasn't really dark moments.\n\n4:24:34.100 --> 4:24:36.620\n I mean, there was one thing where I'd been running so long\n\n4:24:36.620 --> 4:24:39.020\n I thought, well, I must almost be done.\n\n4:24:39.020 --> 4:24:43.060\n And then I found out I had like 15 miles more.\n\n4:24:44.700 --> 4:24:48.420\n But I guess with all of these things,\n\n4:24:48.420 --> 4:24:51.700\n it's the messages that we tell ourselves.\n\n4:24:51.700 --> 4:24:55.500\n And so for me, it's like the message I always tell myself\n\n4:24:55.500 --> 4:24:58.740\n is quitting isn't an option.\n\n4:24:58.740 --> 4:25:00.700\n I mean, once in a while you kind of have to quit\n\n4:25:00.700 --> 4:25:02.420\n if like, listen to the universe,\n\n4:25:02.420 --> 4:25:04.800\n if whatever, you're gonna kill yourself or something.\n\n4:25:04.800 --> 4:25:08.500\n But for me, it was just, whatever it takes,\n\n4:25:08.500 --> 4:25:10.140\n there's no way I'm stopping.\n\n4:25:10.140 --> 4:25:14.220\n And if I have to go up this muddy hill 20 times\n\n4:25:14.220 --> 4:25:17.760\n because I keep sliding, I'm sure there's a way.\n\n4:25:17.760 --> 4:25:19.620\n It's probably a personality flaw.\n\n4:25:21.540 --> 4:25:23.880\n Where does your love for chocolate come from?\n\n4:25:23.880 --> 4:25:24.940\n Oh, it's a great question.\n\n4:25:24.940 --> 4:25:27.420\n And in both of my Joe Rogan interviews,\n\n4:25:27.420 --> 4:25:29.020\n that's the first question that he asked.\n\n4:25:29.020 --> 4:25:30.940\n So I'm glad that we've gotten to that.\n\n4:25:30.940 --> 4:25:33.900\n So one, I've always loved chocolate.\n\n4:25:33.900 --> 4:25:37.900\n And I call it like a secret, but now that I keep telling,\n\n4:25:37.900 --> 4:25:39.540\n if you keep telling the same secret,\n\n4:25:39.540 --> 4:25:42.060\n it's actually no longer a secret,\n\n4:25:42.060 --> 4:25:45.180\n that I have a secret, which is not secret\n\n4:25:45.180 --> 4:25:47.740\n because I'm telling you on a podcast,\n\n4:25:47.740 --> 4:25:50.140\n life as a chocolate shaman.\n\n4:25:50.140 --> 4:25:53.540\n And so when I give keynotes at tech conferences,\n\n4:25:53.540 --> 4:25:55.580\n I always say, I'm happy to give a keynote,\n\n4:25:55.580 --> 4:25:59.040\n but I want to lead a sacred cacao ceremony in the night.\n\n4:25:59.040 --> 4:26:00.580\n I'm actually, believe it or not,\n\n4:26:00.580 --> 4:26:02.580\n the official chocolate shaman\n\n4:26:02.580 --> 4:26:05.180\n of what used to be called exponential medicine,\n\n4:26:05.180 --> 4:26:06.700\n which is part of Singularity University.\n\n4:26:06.700 --> 4:26:09.620\n Now, my friend Daniel Kraft who runs it,\n\n4:26:09.620 --> 4:26:12.620\n it's going to be called NextMed.\n\n4:26:12.620 --> 4:26:14.820\n And so, but I'll have to go back.\n\n4:26:14.820 --> 4:26:19.460\n As I was going to Berlin a lot of years ago,\n\n4:26:19.460 --> 4:26:20.560\n and I've always loved chocolate,\n\n4:26:20.560 --> 4:26:23.780\n I was going to Berlin to give a keynote\n\n4:26:23.780 --> 4:26:28.420\n at a big conference called TOA, Tech Open Air.\n\n4:26:28.420 --> 4:26:31.820\n And so when I got there, the first night,\n\n4:26:31.820 --> 4:26:33.020\n I was supposed to give a talk,\n\n4:26:33.020 --> 4:26:34.540\n but there had been some mix up.\n\n4:26:34.540 --> 4:26:36.700\n They'd forgotten to reserve the room.\n\n4:26:36.700 --> 4:26:38.340\n And so the talk got canceled.\n\n4:26:38.340 --> 4:26:41.300\n And in the brochure, they had all these different events\n\n4:26:41.300 --> 4:26:44.060\n around Berlin that you could go to.\n\n4:26:44.060 --> 4:26:46.260\n And one of them was a cacao ceremony.\n\n4:26:46.260 --> 4:26:49.660\n And so I went there and actually met somebody,\n\n4:26:49.660 --> 4:26:52.100\n Viviana, who is still a friend,\n\n4:26:52.100 --> 4:26:53.460\n but I met, going in there,\n\n4:26:53.460 --> 4:26:54.740\n and there was this cacao ceremony.\n\n4:26:54.740 --> 4:26:56.640\n These kind of hippie dudes.\n\n4:26:56.640 --> 4:26:59.700\n And then everybody got the cacao.\n\n4:26:59.700 --> 4:27:01.060\n And then they said, all right,\n\n4:27:01.060 --> 4:27:03.180\n as they talked a little bit about the process,\n\n4:27:03.180 --> 4:27:04.020\n and then they said, all right,\n\n4:27:04.020 --> 4:27:06.620\n everyone just stand and kind of,\n\n4:27:06.620 --> 4:27:09.580\n we're going to spin around in a circle for 45 minutes.\n\n4:27:09.580 --> 4:27:12.900\n And so I spun around in the circle for like 10 minutes,\n\n4:27:12.900 --> 4:27:14.140\n but then I had to leave\n\n4:27:14.140 --> 4:27:15.880\n because I had to go to something else.\n\n4:27:15.880 --> 4:27:18.500\n And so that, I thought that was that.\n\n4:27:18.500 --> 4:27:21.100\n But then I saw Viviana the next day,\n\n4:27:21.100 --> 4:27:23.260\n and I said, well, how did the cacao ceremony go?\n\n4:27:23.260 --> 4:27:25.340\n And she showed me these pictures\n\n4:27:25.340 --> 4:27:28.420\n of all of these people, mostly naked,\n\n4:27:28.420 --> 4:27:30.620\n like it turned into chaos.\n\n4:27:30.620 --> 4:27:31.460\n Oh, that's awesome.\n\n4:27:31.460 --> 4:27:33.700\n And it was like, oh, and so let me get this straight.\n\n4:27:33.700 --> 4:27:35.620\n People drank chocolate,\n\n4:27:35.620 --> 4:27:37.700\n then they spun around in a circle,\n\n4:27:37.700 --> 4:27:39.200\n and something else happened.\n\n4:27:39.200 --> 4:27:41.420\n And anyway, so then two days later,\n\n4:27:41.420 --> 4:27:43.820\n I was invited to another cacao ceremony,\n\n4:27:43.820 --> 4:27:46.380\n which was also actually part of this Toa.\n\n4:27:46.380 --> 4:27:48.660\n And that was kind of more structured,\n\n4:27:48.660 --> 4:27:51.180\n and it was more sane because it was part of this thing.\n\n4:27:51.180 --> 4:27:53.700\n And at the end of that, I had this,\n\n4:27:53.700 --> 4:27:56.900\n I thought one, the greatest thing ever,\n\n4:27:56.900 --> 4:27:58.540\n a sacred cacao ceremony,\n\n4:27:58.540 --> 4:28:01.500\n like you drink chocolate milk and everybody's free.\n\n4:28:01.500 --> 4:28:05.700\n And I love that idea because I've never done drugs,\n\n4:28:05.700 --> 4:28:07.180\n I don't drink.\n\n4:28:07.180 --> 4:28:09.400\n But just part of it is because I think whatever,\n\n4:28:09.400 --> 4:28:12.020\n like I was saying with the ultra running,\n\n4:28:12.020 --> 4:28:14.100\n all of the possibilities are within us\n\n4:28:14.100 --> 4:28:16.820\n if we can get out of our own way.\n\n4:28:16.820 --> 4:28:17.740\n And then I thought, well, you know,\n\n4:28:17.740 --> 4:28:20.180\n I think I can do a better job\n\n4:28:20.180 --> 4:28:22.300\n than what I experienced in Berlin.\n\n4:28:22.300 --> 4:28:23.520\n So I came back and I thought, all right,\n\n4:28:23.520 --> 4:28:26.140\n I'm gonna get accredited as a cacao shaman.\n\n4:28:26.140 --> 4:28:27.560\n And this will shock you.\n\n4:28:27.560 --> 4:28:30.180\n Because I know if you're gonna be like a rabbi\n\n4:28:30.180 --> 4:28:32.040\n or a priest or something, there's some process.\n\n4:28:32.040 --> 4:28:35.100\n But shockingly, there's no official process\n\n4:28:35.100 --> 4:28:38.140\n to become a chocolate shaman.\n\n4:28:38.140 --> 4:28:40.540\n And so I thought, all right, well, you know,\n\n4:28:40.540 --> 4:28:42.180\n I'm just gonna train myself.\n\n4:28:42.180 --> 4:28:45.180\n And when I'm ready, I'm gonna declare my chocolate shamanism.\n\n4:28:45.180 --> 4:28:47.380\n So I started studying different things.\n\n4:28:47.380 --> 4:28:50.320\n And when I was ready, I just said,\n\n4:28:50.320 --> 4:28:52.780\n now I'm a chocolate shaman, self declared.\n\n4:28:52.780 --> 4:28:53.620\n Self declared.\n\n4:28:53.620 --> 4:28:55.500\n And so, but I do these ceremonies\n\n4:28:55.500 --> 4:28:58.340\n and I've done them at tech conferences.\n\n4:28:58.340 --> 4:29:01.060\n I did one in Soho House in New York.\n\n4:29:01.060 --> 4:29:04.180\n I've done it at a place Rancho La Puerta in Mexico.\n\n4:29:04.180 --> 4:29:05.980\n And every time it's the same thing.\n\n4:29:05.980 --> 4:29:10.220\n Because it just, if people are given a license to be free,\n\n4:29:10.220 --> 4:29:13.420\n just to, it doesn't matter, and what I always say is,\n\n4:29:13.420 --> 4:29:15.260\n you're here for a sacred cacao ceremony,\n\n4:29:15.260 --> 4:29:18.340\n but the truth is there's no such thing as sacred cacao.\n\n4:29:18.340 --> 4:29:19.700\n And there's no sacred mountains\n\n4:29:19.700 --> 4:29:22.420\n and there's no sacred people and there's no sacred plants.\n\n4:29:22.420 --> 4:29:25.780\n Because nothing is sacred if we don't attribute,\n\n4:29:25.780 --> 4:29:28.820\n ascribe sacredness to it.\n\n4:29:28.820 --> 4:29:32.420\n But if we recognize that everything is sacred,\n\n4:29:32.420 --> 4:29:33.700\n then we'll live different lives.\n\n4:29:33.700 --> 4:29:36.180\n And for the purpose of this ceremony,\n\n4:29:36.180 --> 4:29:37.620\n we're just gonna say, all right,\n\n4:29:37.620 --> 4:29:39.940\n we're gonna focus on this cacao,\n\n4:29:39.940 --> 4:29:43.420\n which actually has been used ceremonially for 5,000 years.\n\n4:29:43.420 --> 4:29:46.120\n It has all these wonderful properties.\n\n4:29:47.020 --> 4:29:49.480\n But it's just people who get that license\n\n4:29:49.480 --> 4:29:52.260\n and then they're just free and people are dancing\n\n4:29:52.260 --> 4:29:53.100\n and all sorts of things.\n\n4:29:53.100 --> 4:29:57.140\n Is the goal to celebrate life in general?\n\n4:29:57.140 --> 4:30:00.640\n Is it to celebrate the senses, like taste?\n\n4:30:00.640 --> 4:30:03.020\n Is it to celebrate yourself, each other?\n\n4:30:03.020 --> 4:30:04.100\n What is there?\n\n4:30:04.100 --> 4:30:09.020\n I think the core is gratitude and just appreciation.\n\n4:30:09.020 --> 4:30:10.460\n All the experiences in life?\n\n4:30:10.460 --> 4:30:12.460\n Yeah, just of being alive,\n\n4:30:12.460 --> 4:30:15.100\n of just living in this sacred world\n\n4:30:15.100 --> 4:30:16.340\n where we have all these things\n\n4:30:16.340 --> 4:30:19.540\n that we don't even pay any attention to.\n\n4:30:19.540 --> 4:30:23.080\n My friend, A.J. Jacobs, he had a wonderful book\n\n4:30:23.080 --> 4:30:27.020\n that I use the spirit of it in the ceremonies,\n\n4:30:27.020 --> 4:30:31.060\n not the exactly, but he was in a restaurant in New York,\n\n4:30:31.060 --> 4:30:33.220\n a coffee shop, and his child said,\n\n4:30:33.220 --> 4:30:35.020\n hey, where does the coffee come from?\n\n4:30:35.020 --> 4:30:38.820\n And he's like a wonderful big thinker.\n\n4:30:38.820 --> 4:30:41.060\n And he started really answering that question.\n\n4:30:41.060 --> 4:30:42.700\n Well, here's where the beans come from,\n\n4:30:42.700 --> 4:30:44.300\n but how did the beans get here\n\n4:30:44.300 --> 4:30:46.260\n and who painted the yellow line on the street\n\n4:30:46.260 --> 4:30:50.140\n so the truck didn't crash and who made the cup?\n\n4:30:50.140 --> 4:30:53.120\n And he spent a year making a full spreadsheet\n\n4:30:53.120 --> 4:30:56.460\n of all of the people who in one way or another\n\n4:30:56.460 --> 4:31:00.300\n played some role in that one cup of coffee.\n\n4:31:00.300 --> 4:31:03.500\n And he traveled all around the world thanking them.\n\n4:31:03.500 --> 4:31:05.100\n Like, it's like, thank you for painting\n\n4:31:05.100 --> 4:31:06.900\n the yellow line on the road.\n\n4:31:06.900 --> 4:31:09.700\n And so for me with the cacao, part of when I do\n\n4:31:09.700 --> 4:31:12.060\n these ceremonies is just to say like,\n\n4:31:12.060 --> 4:31:15.220\n you're drinking this cacao, but there's a person\n\n4:31:15.220 --> 4:31:16.860\n who planted the seed, there's a person\n\n4:31:16.860 --> 4:31:19.020\n who watered the plant, there's a person,\n\n4:31:19.020 --> 4:31:22.420\n and I just think that level of awareness,\n\n4:31:22.420 --> 4:31:24.260\n and it's true with anything.\n\n4:31:24.260 --> 4:31:27.980\n Like you have in front of you a stuffed hedgehog, so.\n\n4:31:27.980 --> 4:31:28.860\n Somebody made that.\n\n4:31:28.860 --> 4:31:30.220\n I love it, it's great.\n\n4:31:30.220 --> 4:31:32.140\n But like, if we just said, all right,\n\n4:31:32.140 --> 4:31:35.200\n where does this stuffed hedgehog come from?\n\n4:31:35.200 --> 4:31:38.980\n We would have a full story of globalization,\n\n4:31:38.980 --> 4:31:42.120\n of the interconnection of people all around the world\n\n4:31:42.120 --> 4:31:45.140\n doing all sorts of things of human imagination.\n\n4:31:45.140 --> 4:31:47.380\n It's beyond our capacity and our daily,\n\n4:31:47.380 --> 4:31:49.580\n we'd go insane if every day,\n\n4:31:49.580 --> 4:31:51.260\n like we're speaking into a microphone,\n\n4:31:51.260 --> 4:31:54.540\n well, what are the hundreds of years of technology\n\n4:31:54.540 --> 4:31:56.060\n that make this possible?\n\n4:31:56.060 --> 4:31:59.140\n But if just once in a while, we just focus on one thing\n\n4:31:59.140 --> 4:32:01.940\n and say, this thing is sacred.\n\n4:32:01.940 --> 4:32:04.100\n And because I'm recognizing that\n\n4:32:04.100 --> 4:32:07.020\n and I'm having an appreciation for the world around me,\n\n4:32:07.020 --> 4:32:10.420\n it just kind of makes my life feel more sacred.\n\n4:32:10.420 --> 4:32:12.480\n It makes me recognize my connection to others.\n\n4:32:12.480 --> 4:32:14.700\n So that's the gist of it.\n\n4:32:14.700 --> 4:32:16.920\n Yeah, it's funny, I often look at\n\n4:32:19.660 --> 4:32:23.540\n things in this world and moments and just am in awe\n\n4:32:24.800 --> 4:32:27.700\n of the full\n\n4:32:27.700 --> 4:32:32.700\n universe that brought that to be.\n\n4:32:33.780 --> 4:32:35.620\n In a similar way as you're saying,\n\n4:32:35.620 --> 4:32:38.940\n but I don't as often think about exactly what you're saying,\n\n4:32:38.940 --> 4:32:41.580\n which is the number of people behind every little thing\n\n4:32:41.580 --> 4:32:43.060\n we get to enjoy.\n\n4:32:43.060 --> 4:32:45.620\n I mean, yeah, this hedgehog, this microphone,\n\n4:32:46.540 --> 4:32:49.600\n like directly, like thousands of people involved.\n\n4:32:49.600 --> 4:32:50.440\n Millions.\n\n4:32:50.440 --> 4:32:52.140\n And then indirectly, it's millions.\n\n4:32:52.140 --> 4:32:57.140\n Like, and they're all like this microphone\n\n4:32:59.260 --> 4:33:01.820\n that there's like artists, essentially,\n\n4:33:01.820 --> 4:33:04.100\n like people who made it their life's work,\n\n4:33:04.100 --> 4:33:07.420\n all the costs, like from the factories to the manufacturer,\n\n4:33:07.420 --> 4:33:11.620\n there's families that the production of this microphone\n\n4:33:11.620 --> 4:33:14.860\n and this hedgehog are fed because of the skill\n\n4:33:14.860 --> 4:33:18.780\n of this human that helped contribute to that development.\n\n4:33:18.780 --> 4:33:20.060\n Yeah, it's.\n\n4:33:20.060 --> 4:33:22.420\n And like Isaac Newton and John von Neumann\n\n4:33:22.420 --> 4:33:24.420\n are in this microphone.\n\n4:33:24.420 --> 4:33:26.180\n They're standing on the shoulders of giants\n\n4:33:26.180 --> 4:33:28.600\n and we're standing on their shoulders.\n\n4:33:28.600 --> 4:33:31.380\n And somebody will be standing on ours.\n\n4:33:34.100 --> 4:33:39.100\n You mentioned One Shared World, what is it?\n\n4:33:40.000 --> 4:33:41.060\n Well, thanks for asking.\n\n4:33:41.060 --> 4:33:42.980\n And by the way, what I will say is the people\n\n4:33:42.980 --> 4:33:46.220\n who are listening, this is so incredible\n\n4:33:46.220 --> 4:33:49.540\n and I'm so thrilled to have this kind of long conversation.\n\n4:33:49.540 --> 4:33:54.260\n Hello, person who's listening past the five hour mark.\n\n4:33:54.260 --> 4:33:55.160\n Thanks, mom.\n\n4:33:56.840 --> 4:33:58.200\n I salute you.\n\n4:33:58.200 --> 4:34:00.780\n Somebody was like sleeping for the first four hours\n\n4:34:00.780 --> 4:34:01.740\n and just woke up.\n\n4:34:01.740 --> 4:34:04.700\n Now's the good stuff, I've been saving it.\n\n4:34:04.700 --> 4:34:09.220\n But, and I have to say that so much of our lives\n\n4:34:09.220 --> 4:34:11.220\n is forced into these short bursts\n\n4:34:11.220 --> 4:34:14.180\n that I'm just so appreciative to have the chance\n\n4:34:14.180 --> 4:34:15.740\n to have this conversation.\n\n4:34:15.740 --> 4:34:16.580\n So thank you for that.\n\n4:34:16.580 --> 4:34:18.700\n Some people would say five hours is short, so.\n\n4:34:18.700 --> 4:34:20.740\n You know, let's go.\n\n4:34:20.740 --> 4:34:25.740\n And yeah, that's what my girlfriend says.\n\n4:34:25.780 --> 4:34:29.260\n Like if I was like captured and tortured\n\n4:34:29.260 --> 4:34:30.820\n and they were gonna interrogate me,\n\n4:34:30.820 --> 4:34:32.700\n it's like at the end they'd say, all right.\n\n4:34:32.700 --> 4:34:35.500\n No, we're sick of this guy, we quit.\n\n4:34:35.500 --> 4:34:36.340\n Let him go.\n\n4:34:36.340 --> 4:34:37.300\n I love it.\n\n4:34:37.300 --> 4:34:39.940\n So background on One Shared World.\n\n4:34:39.940 --> 4:34:43.140\n I mentioned I'm on a faculty for Singularity University.\n\n4:34:43.140 --> 4:34:45.300\n In the earliest days of the pandemic,\n\n4:34:45.300 --> 4:34:48.580\n I was invited to give a talk on whether the tools\n\n4:34:48.580 --> 4:34:50.340\n of the genetics and biotech revolutions\n\n4:34:50.340 --> 4:34:52.820\n were a match for the outbreak.\n\n4:34:52.820 --> 4:34:55.100\n And my view was then as now\n\n4:34:55.100 --> 4:34:57.460\n that the answer to that question is yes.\n\n4:34:57.460 --> 4:34:58.940\n But I woke up that morning\n\n4:34:58.940 --> 4:35:02.700\n and I felt that that wasn't the most important talk\n\n4:35:02.700 --> 4:35:03.540\n that I could give.\n\n4:35:03.540 --> 4:35:06.060\n There was something else that was more pressing for me.\n\n4:35:06.060 --> 4:35:08.220\n And that was the realization,\n\n4:35:08.220 --> 4:35:09.100\n they were asking the question,\n\n4:35:09.100 --> 4:35:12.020\n well, why weren't we prepared for this pandemic?\n\n4:35:12.020 --> 4:35:14.420\n Because we could have been, we weren't.\n\n4:35:14.420 --> 4:35:17.020\n And why can't, and because of that,\n\n4:35:17.020 --> 4:35:21.860\n why can't we respond adequately to this outbreak?\n\n4:35:23.020 --> 4:35:24.580\n And then there was the thing, well,\n\n4:35:24.580 --> 4:35:27.740\n if we, even if we respond somehow miraculously\n\n4:35:27.740 --> 4:35:31.460\n overcome this pandemic, it's a pyrrhic victory\n\n4:35:31.460 --> 4:35:35.540\n if we don't prepare ourselves to respond\n\n4:35:35.540 --> 4:35:37.580\n to the broader category of pandemics,\n\n4:35:37.580 --> 4:35:40.700\n particularly as we enter the age of synthetic biology.\n\n4:35:40.700 --> 4:35:44.900\n But if somehow miraculously we solve that problem,\n\n4:35:44.900 --> 4:35:47.380\n but we don't solve the problem of climate change,\n\n4:35:47.380 --> 4:35:48.220\n well, kind of who cares?\n\n4:35:48.220 --> 4:35:49.220\n We didn't have a pandemic,\n\n4:35:49.220 --> 4:35:51.500\n but we wiped everybody out from climate change.\n\n4:35:51.500 --> 4:35:55.020\n And let's just say, you get where this is going,\n\n4:35:55.020 --> 4:35:58.660\n that we organize ourselves and we solve climate change.\n\n4:35:58.660 --> 4:36:00.620\n And then we have a nuclear war\n\n4:36:00.620 --> 4:36:03.060\n because everybody's, particularly China now,\n\n4:36:03.060 --> 4:36:05.180\n but US, the former Soviet Union\n\n4:36:05.180 --> 4:36:07.100\n are building all these nuclear weapons.\n\n4:36:07.100 --> 4:36:09.060\n Who cares that we solved climate change\n\n4:36:09.060 --> 4:36:10.460\n because we're all gone anyway.\n\n4:36:10.460 --> 4:36:14.900\n And the meta category, bringing all of those things together\n\n4:36:14.900 --> 4:36:19.700\n was this mismatch between the increasingly global\n\n4:36:19.700 --> 4:36:24.020\n and shared nature of the biggest challenges that we face\n\n4:36:24.020 --> 4:36:29.020\n and our inability to solve that entire category of problems.\n\n4:36:29.420 --> 4:36:32.220\n And there's a historical issue,\n\n4:36:32.220 --> 4:36:36.500\n which is that prior to the 30 Years War in the 17th century,\n\n4:36:36.500 --> 4:36:38.900\n we had all these different kinds of sovereignty\n\n4:36:38.900 --> 4:36:41.100\n and religious and different kinds\n\n4:36:41.100 --> 4:36:44.100\n of organizational principles and everybody got in this war.\n\n4:36:44.100 --> 4:36:46.780\n And in this series of treaties\n\n4:36:46.780 --> 4:36:50.420\n that together are called the Peace of Westphalia,\n\n4:36:50.420 --> 4:36:52.980\n the framework for the modern,\n\n4:36:52.980 --> 4:36:55.780\n what we now understand as the modern nation state was laid.\n\n4:36:55.780 --> 4:36:58.540\n And then through colonialism and other means\n\n4:36:58.540 --> 4:37:03.180\n that idea of a state is what it is today,\n\n4:37:03.180 --> 4:37:05.980\n spread throughout the world.\n\n4:37:05.980 --> 4:37:09.580\n Then through particularly the late 19th\n\n4:37:09.580 --> 4:37:10.980\n and early 20th century,\n\n4:37:10.980 --> 4:37:14.140\n we realized how unstable that system was\n\n4:37:14.140 --> 4:37:16.420\n because you always had these jockeying\n\n4:37:16.420 --> 4:37:18.300\n between sovereign states and some were rising\n\n4:37:18.300 --> 4:37:21.020\n and some were falling and you ended up in war.\n\n4:37:21.020 --> 4:37:23.380\n And that was the genius of the generations\n\n4:37:23.380 --> 4:37:25.900\n who came together in 1945 in San Francisco\n\n4:37:25.900 --> 4:37:28.220\n and the planning had even started before then,\n\n4:37:28.220 --> 4:37:30.900\n who said, well, we can't just have that world,\n\n4:37:30.900 --> 4:37:32.580\n we need to have an overlay.\n\n4:37:32.580 --> 4:37:34.900\n And we talked about the UN and the WHO\n\n4:37:34.900 --> 4:37:39.780\n of systems which transcend our national sovereignties.\n\n4:37:39.780 --> 4:37:42.220\n They don't get rid of them, but they transcend them\n\n4:37:42.220 --> 4:37:44.660\n so we can solve this category of problems.\n\n4:37:44.660 --> 4:37:47.740\n But we're now reaching a point where our reach as humans,\n\n4:37:47.740 --> 4:37:51.020\n even individually, but collectively is so great\n\n4:37:51.020 --> 4:37:52.540\n that there's a mismatch between, as I said,\n\n4:37:52.540 --> 4:37:53.820\n the nature of the problems\n\n4:37:53.820 --> 4:37:57.980\n and the ability to solve those problems.\n\n4:37:57.980 --> 4:38:00.180\n And unless we can address\n\n4:38:00.180 --> 4:38:03.820\n that broader global collective action problem,\n\n4:38:03.820 --> 4:38:05.340\n we're going to extinct ourselves.\n\n4:38:05.340 --> 4:38:08.180\n And we see these different, what I call verticals,\n\n4:38:08.180 --> 4:38:09.500\n whether it's climate change\n\n4:38:09.500 --> 4:38:13.100\n or trying to prevent a nuclear weapons proliferation\n\n4:38:13.100 --> 4:38:16.260\n or anything else, but none of those can succeed.\n\n4:38:16.260 --> 4:38:18.940\n And frankly, it doesn't even matter if one succeeds\n\n4:38:18.940 --> 4:38:21.660\n because all of them have the potential\n\n4:38:21.660 --> 4:38:24.420\n to lead to extinction level events.\n\n4:38:25.340 --> 4:38:30.020\n So I gave that talk and that talk went viral.\n\n4:38:30.020 --> 4:38:32.940\n I stayed up all night the next night and I drafted,\n\n4:38:32.940 --> 4:38:35.140\n I think it was like an insanity,\n\n4:38:35.140 --> 4:38:36.860\n but I think a lot of us were manic\n\n4:38:36.860 --> 4:38:38.900\n in those early days of the pandemics\n\n4:38:38.900 --> 4:38:40.180\n wanting to do something.\n\n4:38:40.180 --> 4:38:42.220\n And so I stayed up all night and I drafted\n\n4:38:42.220 --> 4:38:45.460\n what I called a declaration of global interdependence.\n\n4:38:45.460 --> 4:38:48.620\n And I posted that on my website, my jamiemuscle.com.\n\n4:38:48.620 --> 4:38:49.620\n It's still there.\n\n4:38:49.620 --> 4:38:51.780\n And that went viral.\n\n4:38:51.780 --> 4:38:54.140\n And so then I called a meeting just on the people\n\n4:38:54.140 --> 4:38:56.300\n on my personal email list.\n\n4:38:56.300 --> 4:38:59.620\n And so we had people from 25 countries.\n\n4:38:59.620 --> 4:39:00.900\n There were all of these people\n\n4:39:00.900 --> 4:39:02.500\n who were having the same thing.\n\n4:39:02.500 --> 4:39:03.940\n There's something wrong in the world.\n\n4:39:03.940 --> 4:39:07.700\n They wanted to be part of a process of fixing it.\n\n4:39:07.700 --> 4:39:10.500\n And so it was a crazy 35 days\n\n4:39:10.500 --> 4:39:12.940\n where we broke into eight different working groups.\n\n4:39:12.940 --> 4:39:16.060\n We had an amazing team that helped redraft\n\n4:39:16.060 --> 4:39:18.740\n what became the declaration of interdependence,\n\n4:39:18.740 --> 4:39:21.460\n which is now in 20 languages.\n\n4:39:21.460 --> 4:39:23.380\n We laid out a work plan.\n\n4:39:23.380 --> 4:39:27.020\n We founded this organization called One Shared World.\n\n4:39:27.020 --> 4:39:28.940\n The URL is oneshared.world.\n\n4:39:28.940 --> 4:39:31.500\n And it's just been this incredible journey.\n\n4:39:31.500 --> 4:39:33.100\n We now have people who are participating\n\n4:39:33.100 --> 4:39:36.940\n in one way or another from 120 different countries.\n\n4:39:36.940 --> 4:39:40.340\n We have our public events exploring these issues,\n\n4:39:40.340 --> 4:39:43.020\n get millions of viewers.\n\n4:39:43.020 --> 4:39:46.660\n We have world leaders who are participating.\n\n4:39:46.660 --> 4:39:51.260\n So the vision is to work on some of these big problems,\n\n4:39:51.260 --> 4:39:53.500\n arbitrary number of problems that present themselves\n\n4:39:53.500 --> 4:39:56.420\n in the world that face all of human civilization\n\n4:39:56.420 --> 4:39:58.100\n and to be able to work together.\n\n4:39:58.100 --> 4:40:02.180\n Well, that is, but there's a macro, a meta problem,\n\n4:40:02.180 --> 4:40:04.580\n which is the global collective action problem.\n\n4:40:04.580 --> 4:40:09.580\n And so the idea is even if we just focus on the verticals,\n\n4:40:10.020 --> 4:40:12.500\n on the manifestations of the global collective action\n\n4:40:12.500 --> 4:40:16.460\n problem, there'll be an infinite number of those things.\n\n4:40:16.460 --> 4:40:18.860\n So while we work on those things,\n\n4:40:18.860 --> 4:40:22.700\n like climate change, pandemics, WMD and other things,\n\n4:40:22.700 --> 4:40:25.220\n we also have to ask the bigger questions\n\n4:40:25.220 --> 4:40:27.380\n of why can't we solve this category of problems.\n\n4:40:27.380 --> 4:40:30.100\n And the idea is, at least from my observation,\n\n4:40:30.100 --> 4:40:34.980\n is that whenever big decisions are being made,\n\n4:40:34.980 --> 4:40:37.620\n our national leaders and corporate leaders\n\n4:40:37.620 --> 4:40:40.460\n are doing exactly what we've hired them to do.\n\n4:40:40.460 --> 4:40:43.620\n They're maximizing for national interest,\n\n4:40:43.620 --> 4:40:45.020\n even, or corporate interests,\n\n4:40:45.020 --> 4:40:48.460\n even at the expense of everybody.\n\n4:40:48.460 --> 4:40:50.420\n And so it's not that we wanna get rid of states.\n\n4:40:50.420 --> 4:40:52.660\n States are essential in our world system.\n\n4:40:52.660 --> 4:40:54.300\n It's not we wanna undermine the UN,\n\n4:40:54.300 --> 4:40:57.860\n which is also essential, but massively underperforming.\n\n4:40:57.860 --> 4:40:59.260\n What we wanna do is to create\n\n4:40:59.260 --> 4:41:02.300\n an empowered global constituency of people\n\n4:41:02.300 --> 4:41:06.180\n who are demanding that their leaders at all levels\n\n4:41:06.180 --> 4:41:09.060\n just do a better job of balancing\n\n4:41:09.060 --> 4:41:10.540\n broader and narrower interests.\n\n4:41:10.540 --> 4:41:11.380\n I see.\n\n4:41:11.380 --> 4:41:13.500\n So this is more like a,\n\n4:41:14.740 --> 4:41:17.780\n make it more symmetric in terms of power.\n\n4:41:17.780 --> 4:41:22.780\n It's holding accountable the nations, the leaders.\n\n4:41:22.780 --> 4:41:23.940\n The leaders.\n\n4:41:23.940 --> 4:41:26.900\n The problem is nations are powerful.\n\n4:41:26.900 --> 4:41:29.260\n We talked about China quite a bit.\n\n4:41:29.260 --> 4:41:33.940\n How do you have an organizations of citizens of Earth\n\n4:41:33.940 --> 4:41:36.860\n that can solve this collective problem\n\n4:41:36.860 --> 4:41:39.180\n that holds China accountable?\n\n4:41:39.180 --> 4:41:41.540\n It's difficult, because UN,\n\n4:41:41.540 --> 4:41:42.740\n you could say a lot of things,\n\n4:41:42.740 --> 4:41:45.540\n but to call it effective is hard.\n\n4:41:45.540 --> 4:41:50.300\n You know, the internet almost is a kind of representation\n\n4:41:50.300 --> 4:41:55.300\n of a collective force that holds nations accountable.\n\n4:41:57.260 --> 4:41:58.780\n Not to give Twitter too much credit,\n\n4:41:58.780 --> 4:42:01.420\n but social networks, broadly speaking.\n\n4:42:03.380 --> 4:42:05.260\n So you have hope that it's possible\n\n4:42:05.260 --> 4:42:10.260\n to build such collections of humans that resist China.\n\n4:42:10.700 --> 4:42:12.740\n Not necessarily resist China,\n\n4:42:12.740 --> 4:42:16.900\n but human, I mean, our cultures change over time.\n\n4:42:16.900 --> 4:42:20.060\n I mean, the idea of the modern nation state\n\n4:42:20.060 --> 4:42:22.460\n would not have made sense to people\n\n4:42:22.460 --> 4:42:24.500\n in the 13th or 14th century.\n\n4:42:24.500 --> 4:42:28.260\n The idea that became the United Nations.\n\n4:42:28.260 --> 4:42:33.260\n I mean, it had its earliest days in the philosophies of Kant.\n\n4:42:33.540 --> 4:42:38.540\n It took a long time for these ideas to be realized.\n\n4:42:39.820 --> 4:42:44.420\n And so the idea, and we're far from successful.\n\n4:42:44.420 --> 4:42:46.940\n I mean, we've had little minor successes,\n\n4:42:46.940 --> 4:42:47.820\n which we're very proud of.\n\n4:42:47.820 --> 4:42:51.180\n We got the G20 leaders to incorporate the language\n\n4:42:51.180 --> 4:42:53.580\n that we provided on addressing the needs\n\n4:42:53.580 --> 4:42:56.140\n of the world's most vulnerable populations\n\n4:42:56.140 --> 4:42:59.620\n into the final summit communique\n\n4:42:59.620 --> 4:43:01.740\n from the G20 summit in Riyadh.\n\n4:43:01.740 --> 4:43:03.700\n This year, we're just on the verge\n\n4:43:03.700 --> 4:43:07.220\n of having our language pat on the same issue,\n\n4:43:07.220 --> 4:43:10.100\n ensuring everyone on earth has access to safe water,\n\n4:43:10.100 --> 4:43:11.500\n basic sanitation and hygiene,\n\n4:43:11.500 --> 4:43:14.580\n and essential pandemic protection by 2030\n\n4:43:14.580 --> 4:43:18.380\n passed as part of a resolution in the United Nations\n\n4:43:18.380 --> 4:43:19.220\n General Assembly.\n\n4:43:19.220 --> 4:43:22.100\n And we're primarily, I mean, it's young people\n\n4:43:22.100 --> 4:43:23.540\n all around the world.\n\n4:43:23.540 --> 4:43:26.060\n And when I told them in the beginning of this year,\n\n4:43:26.060 --> 4:43:26.900\n this is our goal.\n\n4:43:26.900 --> 4:43:28.980\n We're gonna get the UN General Assembly\n\n4:43:28.980 --> 4:43:32.300\n to pass a resolution with our language in it.\n\n4:43:32.300 --> 4:43:35.020\n I mean, first, I think they all thought it was insane,\n\n4:43:35.020 --> 4:43:38.180\n but they were too young and inexperienced\n\n4:43:38.180 --> 4:43:39.860\n to know how insane it was.\n\n4:43:39.860 --> 4:43:42.140\n But now these young people are just so excited\n\n4:43:42.140 --> 4:43:43.740\n that it's actually happening.\n\n4:43:43.740 --> 4:43:48.740\n So what we're trying to do is really to create a movement,\n\n4:43:48.860 --> 4:43:51.580\n which we don't feel that we need to do from scratch\n\n4:43:51.580 --> 4:43:53.100\n because there are a lot of movements.\n\n4:43:53.100 --> 4:43:56.660\n Like right now, we just had the Glasgow G20,\n\n4:43:56.660 --> 4:44:00.380\n I mean, I'm sorry, the Glasgow Climate Change Cup 26,\n\n4:44:00.380 --> 4:44:03.060\n and then Greta Thunberg, who has a huge following\n\n4:44:03.060 --> 4:44:05.780\n and who is an amazing young woman,\n\n4:44:05.780 --> 4:44:08.940\n but I was kind of disappointed in what she said afterwards.\n\n4:44:08.940 --> 4:44:13.060\n It became like a meme on Twitter, which was blah, blah, blah.\n\n4:44:13.060 --> 4:44:15.100\n And basically it was like, blah, blah, blah,\n\n4:44:15.100 --> 4:44:17.500\n these old people are just screwing around\n\n4:44:17.500 --> 4:44:18.860\n and it's a waste of time.\n\n4:44:18.860 --> 4:44:22.300\n And definitely the critique is merited,\n\n4:44:22.300 --> 4:44:25.660\n but young people have never been more empowered,\n\n4:44:25.660 --> 4:44:29.260\n educated, connected than they are now.\n\n4:44:29.260 --> 4:44:34.260\n And so we've had a process with One Shared World\n\n4:44:36.180 --> 4:44:39.660\n where we partnered with the Model United Nations,\n\n4:44:39.660 --> 4:44:42.260\n the Aga Khan Foundation, the India Sanitation Coalition.\n\n4:44:42.260 --> 4:44:44.460\n And what we did is say, all right, we have this goal,\n\n4:44:44.460 --> 4:44:46.980\n water sanitation, hygiene, and pandemic protection\n\n4:44:46.980 --> 4:44:49.420\n for everyone on earth by 2030.\n\n4:44:49.420 --> 4:44:52.100\n And we had debates and consultations\n\n4:44:52.100 --> 4:44:54.980\n using the Model UN framework all around the world\n\n4:44:54.980 --> 4:44:56.860\n in multiple languages.\n\n4:44:56.860 --> 4:44:58.420\n And we said, come up with a plan\n\n4:44:58.420 --> 4:44:59.620\n for how this could be achieved.\n\n4:44:59.620 --> 4:45:02.660\n And these brilliant young people in every country,\n\n4:45:02.660 --> 4:45:04.820\n not every country, most countries,\n\n4:45:04.820 --> 4:45:06.940\n they all contributed, then we had a plan.\n\n4:45:06.940 --> 4:45:08.980\n Then I recruited friends of mine,\n\n4:45:08.980 --> 4:45:11.260\n like my friend Hans Carrell in Sweden,\n\n4:45:11.260 --> 4:45:14.900\n who's the former chief counsel of the whole United Nations,\n\n4:45:14.900 --> 4:45:18.420\n and asked him and others to work with these young people\n\n4:45:18.420 --> 4:45:20.820\n and representatives to turn that\n\n4:45:20.820 --> 4:45:24.780\n into what looks exactly like a UN resolution.\n\n4:45:24.780 --> 4:45:28.380\n It's just written by a bunch of kids all around the world.\n\n4:45:28.380 --> 4:45:31.660\n We then sent that to every permanent representative,\n\n4:45:31.660 --> 4:45:34.260\n every government representative at the UN.\n\n4:45:34.260 --> 4:45:35.580\n And that was why working\n\n4:45:35.580 --> 4:45:37.180\n with the German and Spanish governments,\n\n4:45:37.180 --> 4:45:40.060\n why the language is centralized from that document\n\n4:45:40.060 --> 4:45:41.900\n is about to pass the UN.\n\n4:45:41.900 --> 4:45:43.460\n And it doesn't mean that just passing\n\n4:45:43.460 --> 4:45:46.540\n a UN General Assembly resolution changes anything,\n\n4:45:46.540 --> 4:45:49.860\n but we think that there's a model of engaging people,\n\n4:45:49.860 --> 4:45:50.820\n just like you're talking about,\n\n4:45:50.820 --> 4:45:53.100\n these people who are outside\n\n4:45:53.100 --> 4:45:55.380\n of the traditional power structures\n\n4:45:55.380 --> 4:45:57.940\n and who want to have a voice.\n\n4:45:57.940 --> 4:46:00.020\n But I think we need to give a little bit of structure\n\n4:46:00.020 --> 4:46:03.860\n because just going, I'm a big fan of Global Citizen,\n\n4:46:03.860 --> 4:46:06.740\n but just going to a Global Citizen concert\n\n4:46:06.740 --> 4:46:09.020\n and waving your iPhone back and forth\n\n4:46:09.020 --> 4:46:11.660\n and tweeting about it isn't enough\n\n4:46:11.660 --> 4:46:14.300\n to drive the kind of change that's required.\n\n4:46:14.300 --> 4:46:17.860\n We need to come together, even in untraditional ways,\n\n4:46:17.860 --> 4:46:20.020\n and articulate the change we want\n\n4:46:20.020 --> 4:46:22.900\n and build popular movements to make that happen.\n\n4:46:22.900 --> 4:46:26.500\n And popular means scale and movements at scale\n\n4:46:26.500 --> 4:46:30.420\n that actually, at the individual level, do something\n\n4:46:30.420 --> 4:46:33.380\n and that's then magnified with the scale\n\n4:46:33.380 --> 4:46:35.300\n to actually have significant impact.\n\n4:46:35.300 --> 4:46:39.700\n I mean, at its best, you hear a lot of folks talk\n\n4:46:39.700 --> 4:46:44.500\n about the various cryptocurrencies as possibly helping.\n\n4:46:44.500 --> 4:46:46.980\n You have young people get involved\n\n4:46:46.980 --> 4:46:49.380\n in challenging the power structures\n\n4:46:49.380 --> 4:46:51.220\n by challenging the monetary system.\n\n4:46:51.220 --> 4:46:56.220\n And there's, some of it is number go up,\n\n4:46:56.580 --> 4:47:00.940\n people get excited when they can make a little bit of money,\n\n4:47:00.940 --> 4:47:04.820\n but that's actually almost like an entry point\n\n4:47:04.820 --> 4:47:07.660\n because then you almost feel empowered.\n\n4:47:07.660 --> 4:47:10.180\n And because of that, you start to think\n\n4:47:10.180 --> 4:47:11.980\n about some of these philosophical ideas\n\n4:47:11.980 --> 4:47:15.220\n that I, as a young person, have the power\n\n4:47:15.220 --> 4:47:16.740\n to change the world.\n\n4:47:16.740 --> 4:47:20.780\n All of these senior folks in the position of power,\n\n4:47:20.780 --> 4:47:24.220\n they were, first of all, they were once young\n\n4:47:24.220 --> 4:47:26.220\n and powerless like me.\n\n4:47:26.220 --> 4:47:29.420\n And I could be part of the next generation\n\n4:47:29.420 --> 4:47:30.260\n that makes a change.\n\n4:47:30.260 --> 4:47:32.060\n Well, all the things I see that are wrong\n\n4:47:32.060 --> 4:47:34.620\n with the world, I can make it better.\n\n4:47:34.620 --> 4:47:39.620\n And it's very true that the overly powerful nations\n\n4:47:39.980 --> 4:47:43.380\n of the world could be a relic of the past.\n\n4:47:43.380 --> 4:47:47.940\n That could be a 20th century and before idea\n\n4:47:47.940 --> 4:47:52.580\n that was tried, created a lot of benefit,\n\n4:47:52.580 --> 4:47:56.580\n but we also saw the problems with that kind of world,\n\n4:47:56.580 --> 4:47:58.060\n extreme nationalism.\n\n4:47:58.980 --> 4:48:02.660\n We see the benefits and the problems of the Cold War.\n\n4:48:02.660 --> 4:48:04.860\n Arguably Cold War got us to the moon,\n\n4:48:06.460 --> 4:48:08.580\n but there could be other, a lot of other different\n\n4:48:08.580 --> 4:48:11.220\n mechanisms that inspired competition,\n\n4:48:11.220 --> 4:48:13.860\n especially friendly competition between nations\n\n4:48:13.860 --> 4:48:16.420\n versus adversarial competition that resulted\n\n4:48:16.420 --> 4:48:18.140\n in the response to COVID, for example,\n\n4:48:18.140 --> 4:48:20.540\n with China and the United States and Russia\n\n4:48:20.540 --> 4:48:23.660\n and the secrecy, the censorship.\n\n4:48:25.900 --> 4:48:27.700\n Yeah, and all the things that are basically\n\n4:48:27.700 --> 4:48:31.420\n against the spirit of science\n\n4:48:31.420 --> 4:48:34.100\n and resulted in the loss of trillions of dollars\n\n4:48:34.100 --> 4:48:37.620\n and the cost of countless lives.\n\n4:48:37.620 --> 4:48:41.540\n What gives you hope about the future, Jamie?\n\n4:48:41.540 --> 4:48:45.060\n Well, one of the things, you mentioned cryptocurrency\n\n4:48:45.060 --> 4:48:47.900\n and then as you know better than most,\n\n4:48:47.900 --> 4:48:50.300\n there's cryptocurrency and then underneath\n\n4:48:50.300 --> 4:48:52.260\n the cryptocurrency, there's the blockchain\n\n4:48:52.260 --> 4:48:54.100\n and the distributed ledger.\n\n4:48:54.100 --> 4:48:56.380\n And then like we talked about, there are all these\n\n4:48:56.380 --> 4:49:00.100\n young people who are able to connect with each other,\n\n4:49:00.100 --> 4:49:03.220\n to organize in new ways.\n\n4:49:03.220 --> 4:49:07.100\n And I work with these young people every single day\n\n4:49:07.100 --> 4:49:09.460\n through One Shared World primarily,\n\n4:49:09.460 --> 4:49:11.220\n but also other things.\n\n4:49:11.220 --> 4:49:13.180\n And there's so much optimism.\n\n4:49:13.180 --> 4:49:18.180\n There's so much hope that I just have a lot of faith\n\n4:49:18.900 --> 4:49:20.620\n that we're gonna figure something out.\n\n4:49:20.620 --> 4:49:23.940\n I'm an optimist by nature.\n\n4:49:23.940 --> 4:49:26.700\n And that doesn't mean that we need to be blind\n\n4:49:26.700 --> 4:49:27.540\n to the dangers.\n\n4:49:27.540 --> 4:49:30.420\n There are very, very real dangers,\n\n4:49:30.420 --> 4:49:34.740\n but just given half the chance, people wanna be good.\n\n4:49:34.740 --> 4:49:37.180\n People want to do the right thing.\n\n4:49:37.180 --> 4:49:40.060\n And I do believe that there's a role,\n\n4:49:40.060 --> 4:49:42.940\n maybe there's a role for the at least near term\n\n4:49:42.940 --> 4:49:46.780\n for governments, but there's always a role for leadership.\n\n4:49:46.780 --> 4:49:50.500\n And I'm, I guess like a Gramscian in the sense\n\n4:49:50.500 --> 4:49:53.980\n that I think that we need to create frameworks\n\n4:49:53.980 --> 4:49:58.620\n and structures that allow leaders to emerge.\n\n4:49:58.620 --> 4:50:02.940\n And we need to build norms so that the leaders who emerge\n\n4:50:02.940 --> 4:50:07.940\n are leaders who call on us, inspire our best instincts\n\n4:50:08.180 --> 4:50:10.900\n and not drive us toward our worst.\n\n4:50:10.900 --> 4:50:13.740\n But I really see a lot of hope.\n\n4:50:13.740 --> 4:50:18.740\n And when you say this all the time in your podcast,\n\n4:50:19.460 --> 4:50:21.780\n and you may even be more optimistic to me\n\n4:50:21.780 --> 4:50:24.820\n as you look at the darkest moments of human history\n\n4:50:24.820 --> 4:50:29.740\n and see hope, but we're kind of a crazy, wonderful species.\n\n4:50:29.740 --> 4:50:32.500\n I mean, yes, we figured out ways to slaughter each other\n\n4:50:32.500 --> 4:50:36.100\n at scale, but we've come up with these wonderful philosophies\n\n4:50:36.100 --> 4:50:38.580\n about love and all of those things.\n\n4:50:38.580 --> 4:50:41.980\n And yeah, maybe the Bonobos have some love\n\n4:50:41.980 --> 4:50:43.940\n in their cultures, but this,\n\n4:50:43.940 --> 4:50:46.180\n we're kind of a wonderful magical species.\n\n4:50:46.180 --> 4:50:49.980\n And if we just can create enough of an infrastructure,\n\n4:50:49.980 --> 4:50:52.100\n doesn't need to be and shouldn't be controlling,\n\n4:50:52.100 --> 4:50:54.100\n just enough of an infrastructure\n\n4:50:54.100 --> 4:50:56.500\n so that people are stakeholders,\n\n4:50:56.500 --> 4:50:57.740\n feel like they're stakeholders\n\n4:50:57.740 --> 4:51:00.340\n in contributing to a positive story,\n\n4:51:00.340 --> 4:51:04.500\n I just really feel the sky is the limit.\n\n4:51:04.500 --> 4:51:06.900\n So if there's somebody who's young right now,\n\n4:51:06.900 --> 4:51:08.740\n somebody in high school, somebody in college\n\n4:51:08.740 --> 4:51:12.380\n listening to you, you've done a lot of incredible things.\n\n4:51:12.380 --> 4:51:17.380\n You're respected by a lot of the elites.\n\n4:51:17.380 --> 4:51:20.860\n You're respected by the people.\n\n4:51:20.860 --> 4:51:25.860\n So you're both able to sort of speak to all groups,\n\n4:51:26.820 --> 4:51:29.860\n walk through the fire, like you mentioned\n\n4:51:29.860 --> 4:51:31.380\n with the slab leak.\n\n4:51:32.460 --> 4:51:36.740\n What advice would you give to young kids today\n\n4:51:36.740 --> 4:51:38.540\n that are inspired by your story?\n\n4:51:38.540 --> 4:51:39.660\n Well, thank you.\n\n4:51:39.660 --> 4:51:41.780\n I mean, I think there's one, there's lots of,\n\n4:51:41.780 --> 4:51:44.300\n I'm honored if anybody is inspired,\n\n4:51:44.300 --> 4:51:48.300\n but it's the same thing as I said with the science\n\n4:51:48.300 --> 4:51:50.020\n that it's all about values.\n\n4:51:50.020 --> 4:51:54.020\n The core of everything is knowing who you are.\n\n4:51:54.020 --> 4:51:56.460\n And so yes, I mean, there's the broader thing\n\n4:51:56.460 --> 4:52:01.460\n of follow your passions, a creative mind\n\n4:52:01.460 --> 4:52:03.820\n and an inquisitive mind is the core of everything\n\n4:52:03.820 --> 4:52:06.540\n because the knowledge base is constantly sharing.\n\n4:52:06.540 --> 4:52:09.020\n So learning how to learn,\n\n4:52:09.020 --> 4:52:13.020\n but at the core of everything is investing\n\n4:52:13.020 --> 4:52:16.500\n in knowing who you are and what you stand for.\n\n4:52:16.500 --> 4:52:21.500\n Because that's the way, that's the path\n\n4:52:21.500 --> 4:52:24.460\n to leading a meaningful life, to contributing,\n\n4:52:24.460 --> 4:52:28.820\n to not feeling alienated from your life as you get older.\n\n4:52:28.820 --> 4:52:33.820\n And just like you live, it's an ongoing process\n\n4:52:34.180 --> 4:52:35.740\n and we all make mistakes\n\n4:52:35.740 --> 4:52:38.700\n and we all kind of travel down wrong paths\n\n4:52:38.700 --> 4:52:41.420\n and just have some love for yourself\n\n4:52:41.420 --> 4:52:44.300\n and recognize that just at every,\n\n4:52:44.300 --> 4:52:46.500\n like I was saying with the Ironman,\n\n4:52:46.500 --> 4:52:50.260\n just when you think there's no possibility\n\n4:52:50.260 --> 4:52:54.540\n that you can go on, there's a 100% possibility\n\n4:52:54.540 --> 4:52:55.460\n that you can go on.\n\n4:52:55.460 --> 4:52:58.060\n And just when you think that nothing better\n\n4:52:58.060 --> 4:53:02.020\n will happen to you, there's a 100% chance\n\n4:53:02.020 --> 4:53:03.660\n that something better will happen to you.\n\n4:53:03.660 --> 4:53:05.700\n You just gotta keep going.\n\n4:53:05.700 --> 4:53:08.740\n Jamie, I've been a fan of yours.\n\n4:53:08.740 --> 4:53:11.980\n I think first heard you on Joe Rogan Experience,\n\n4:53:11.980 --> 4:53:13.860\n but I've been following your work,\n\n4:53:13.860 --> 4:53:18.580\n your bold, fearless work with speaking about the lab leak\n\n4:53:18.580 --> 4:53:20.420\n and everything you represent\n\n4:53:20.420 --> 4:53:23.020\n from your brilliance to your kindness.\n\n4:53:23.020 --> 4:53:27.140\n And the fact that you spent your valuable time with me today\n\n4:53:27.140 --> 4:53:31.620\n and now I officially made you miss your flight.\n\n4:53:31.620 --> 4:53:34.220\n And the fact that you said that\n\n4:53:34.220 --> 4:53:35.740\n whether you were being nice or not,\n\n4:53:35.740 --> 4:53:38.260\n I don't know that you will be okay with that\n\n4:53:38.260 --> 4:53:39.420\n means the world to me.\n\n4:53:39.420 --> 4:53:42.180\n And I'm really honored that you spent your time with me today.\n\n4:53:42.180 --> 4:53:44.980\n Well, really, it's been such a great pleasure\n\n4:53:44.980 --> 4:53:48.100\n and thank you for creating a forum\n\n4:53:48.100 --> 4:53:51.020\n to have these kinds of long conversations.\n\n4:53:51.020 --> 4:53:53.860\n So I really enjoyed it and thank you.\n\n4:53:53.860 --> 4:53:58.340\n And if anybody has now listened for,\n\n4:53:58.340 --> 4:53:59.900\n what's it been, five and a half hours?\n\n4:53:59.900 --> 4:54:00.740\n Yep.\n\n4:54:00.740 --> 4:54:01.820\n Thank you for listening.\n\n4:54:01.820 --> 4:54:03.940\n Welcome to Five Hour Club.\n\n4:54:03.940 --> 4:54:04.780\n Represent.\n\n4:54:04.780 --> 4:54:06.340\n Exactly.\n\n4:54:06.340 --> 4:54:07.180\n Thank you, Jamie.\n\n4:54:07.180 --> 4:54:09.100\n Thanks, Lex.\n\n4:54:09.100 --> 4:54:10.620\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n4:54:10.620 --> 4:54:11.900\n with Jamie Metzl.\n\n4:54:11.900 --> 4:54:13.220\n To support this podcast,\n\n4:54:13.220 --> 4:54:16.100\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n4:54:16.100 --> 4:54:19.580\n And now let me leave you some words from Richard Feynman\n\n4:54:19.580 --> 4:54:21.660\n about science and religion,\n\n4:54:21.660 --> 4:54:24.860\n which I think also applies to science and geopolitics\n\n4:54:24.860 --> 4:54:27.340\n because I believe scientists have the responsibility\n\n4:54:27.340 --> 4:54:29.220\n to think broadly about the world\n\n4:54:29.220 --> 4:54:31.620\n so that they may understand the bigger impact\n\n4:54:31.620 --> 4:54:33.540\n of their inventions.\n\n4:54:33.540 --> 4:54:34.940\n The quote goes like this,\n\n4:54:34.940 --> 4:54:37.660\n In this age of specialization,\n\n4:54:37.660 --> 4:54:39.580\n men who thoroughly know one field\n\n4:54:39.580 --> 4:54:42.940\n are often incompetent to discuss another.\n\n4:54:42.940 --> 4:54:44.140\n The old problems,\n\n4:54:44.140 --> 4:54:46.340\n such as the relation of science and religion,\n\n4:54:46.340 --> 4:54:47.700\n are still with us\n\n4:54:47.700 --> 4:54:51.660\n and I believe present as difficult dilemmas as ever,\n\n4:54:51.660 --> 4:54:54.020\n but they are not often publicly discussed\n\n4:54:54.020 --> 4:54:57.780\n because of the limitations of specialization.\n\n4:54:57.780 --> 4:55:09.300\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
