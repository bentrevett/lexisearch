00:08.320\n and all whatever they give it access to,\n\n00:08.320 --> 00:11.200\n how can we be certain that it's not gonna figure out\n\n00:11.200 --> 00:14.240\n how to get itself out of the cloud,\n\n00:14.240 --> 00:17.280\n how to store itself in other like mediums,\n\n00:17.280 --> 00:21.400\n trees, the optic nerve, the brain, you know what I mean?\n\n00:21.400 --> 00:22.360\n We don't know that.\n\n00:22.360 --> 00:25.280\n We don't know that it won't leap out and like start hanging.\n\n00:25.280 --> 00:28.280\n Like, and then at that point, now we do have the wildfire.\n\n00:28.280 --> 00:30.600\n Now you can't stop it, you can't unplug it.\n\n00:30.600 --> 00:32.360\n You can't shut your servers down\n\n00:32.360 --> 00:34.740\n because it left the box, left the room\n\n00:34.740 --> 00:37.400\n using some technology you haven't even discovered yet.\n\n00:37.400 --> 00:40.760\n How fucking cool would that be for like the men in black\n\n00:40.760 --> 00:42.800\n to come to me like, listen,\n\n00:42.800 --> 00:45.240\n I need you to infiltrate the fucking comedy scene.\n\n00:47.400 --> 00:50.420\n The following is a conversation with Duncan Trussell,\n\n00:50.420 --> 00:51.720\n a standup comedian,\n\n00:51.720 --> 00:54.920\n host of the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast\n\n00:54.920 --> 00:57.200\n and one of my favorite human beings.\n\n00:57.200 --> 00:59.360\n I've been a fan of his for many years.\n\n00:59.360 --> 01:02.680\n So it was a huge honor and pleasure to meet him\n\n01:02.680 --> 01:06.880\n for the first time and to sit down for this chat.\n\n01:06.880 --> 01:09.080\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:09.080 --> 01:11.120\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:11.120 --> 01:12.440\n in the description.\n\n01:12.440 --> 01:15.860\n And now, dear friends, here's Duncan Trussell.\n\n01:16.840 --> 01:18.740\n Nietzsche has this thought experiment\n\n01:18.740 --> 01:21.080\n called eternal recurrence,\n\n01:21.080 --> 01:23.760\n where you get to relive your whole life\n\n01:23.760 --> 01:25.160\n over and over and over and over.\n\n01:25.160 --> 01:30.160\n And I think it's a way to bring to the surface of your mind\n\n01:30.360 --> 01:33.360\n the idea that every single moment in your life matters.\n\n01:33.360 --> 01:36.080\n It intensely matters, the bad and the good.\n\n01:36.080 --> 01:40.360\n And he kind of wants you to imagine that idea\n\n01:40.360 --> 01:43.120\n that every single decision you make throughout your life,\n\n01:43.120 --> 01:44.920\n you repeat over and over and over,\n\n01:44.920 --> 01:46.600\n and he wants you to respond to that.\n\n01:46.600 --> 01:47.980\n Do you feel horrible about that\n\n01:47.980 --> 01:49.480\n or do you feel good about that?\n\n01:49.480 --> 01:51.720\n And you have to think through this idea\n\n01:51.720 --> 01:54.220\n in order to see where you stand in life.\n\n01:54.220 --> 01:56.080\n What is your relationship like with life?\n\n01:56.080 --> 01:58.920\n I actually wanna read the way he first introduces\n\n01:58.920 --> 02:02.980\n that concept for people who are not familiar.\n\n02:02.980 --> 02:05.600\n What if some day or night a demon,\n\n02:05.600 --> 02:09.600\n by the way, he has a demon introduce this thought experiment.\n\n02:09.600 --> 02:13.240\n What if some day or night a demon were to steal after you\n\n02:13.240 --> 02:18.240\n into your loneliest loneliness and say to you, quote,\n\n02:18.540 --> 02:21.720\n this life as you now live it and have lived it,\n\n02:21.720 --> 02:23.560\n you will have to live once more.\n\n02:23.560 --> 02:25.920\n And innumerable times more.\n\n02:25.920 --> 02:28.080\n And there will be nothing new in it.\n\n02:28.080 --> 02:31.280\n But every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh\n\n02:31.280 --> 02:35.240\n and everything unutterably small and great in your life\n\n02:35.240 --> 02:37.000\n will have to return to you,\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:40.040\n all in the same succession and sequence.\n\n02:40.040 --> 02:43.000\n Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:45.960\n and curse the demon who spoke thus?\n\n02:45.960 --> 02:49.380\n Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment\n\n02:49.380 --> 02:51.560\n when you would have answered him,\n\n02:51.560 --> 02:55.920\n you are a God and never have I heard anything more divine.\n\n02:55.920 --> 02:58.000\n So are you terrified or excited\n\n02:58.000 --> 02:59.220\n by such a thought experiment\n\n02:59.220 --> 03:00.600\n when you apply it to your own life?\n\n03:00.600 --> 03:01.920\n Excited.\n\n03:01.920 --> 03:02.860\n Excited.\n\n03:02.860 --> 03:03.700\n Oh.\n\n03:03.700 --> 03:04.520\n Even the dark stuff.\n\n03:04.520 --> 03:05.680\n Oh yeah, for sure.\n\n03:05.680 --> 03:06.520\n Definitely.\n\n03:06.520 --> 03:09.020\n I mean, also that thing you're talking about,\n\n03:10.280 --> 03:13.280\n he kind of leaves out maybe on purpose\n\n03:13.280 --> 03:15.120\n because the thought experiment starts falling apart\n\n03:15.120 --> 03:15.960\n a little bit.\n\n03:15.960 --> 03:16.800\n Yeah.\n\n03:16.800 --> 03:19.240\n The amnesia between each loop.\n\n03:19.240 --> 03:22.240\n So the whole thing gets wiped.\n\n03:22.240 --> 03:24.320\n Now, if the amnesia wasn't there\n\n03:24.320 --> 03:29.040\n and yet somehow you are witnessing the non autonomy\n\n03:29.040 --> 03:31.200\n implicit in what he's talking about,\n\n03:31.200 --> 03:32.740\n so you have to kind of watch yourself\n\n03:32.740 --> 03:34.920\n go through this rotten loop,\n\n03:34.920 --> 03:36.480\n then yeah, that's a description.\n\n03:36.480 --> 03:38.800\n There's probably a boredom that comes into that.\n\n03:38.800 --> 03:41.360\n So you don't experience everything anew.\n\n03:41.360 --> 03:42.200\n Exactly.\n\n03:42.200 --> 03:43.440\n So the bad stuff, the good stuff,\n\n03:43.440 --> 03:45.040\n the newness of it is really important.\n\n03:45.040 --> 03:45.940\n That's it, yeah.\n\n03:45.940 --> 03:49.760\n This is the, in Hades, when you die,\n\n03:51.040 --> 03:52.720\n there's a river, I think it's called Leith.\n\n03:52.720 --> 03:53.560\n You ever heard of this?\n\n03:53.560 --> 03:54.380\n L E T H E.\n\n03:54.380 --> 03:57.400\n You drink from it and you don't remember your past lives.\n\n03:57.400 --> 04:00.220\n And then when you're reborn, it's fresh\n\n04:00.220 --> 04:01.760\n and you don't have to, I mean,\n\n04:01.760 --> 04:05.580\n just think of like the amount of psychological help\n\n04:05.580 --> 04:08.200\n you would need to get over all the bullshit\n\n04:08.200 --> 04:10.660\n that happened in prior lives.\n\n04:10.660 --> 04:11.500\n You know what I mean?\n\n04:11.500 --> 04:13.900\n Can you imagine if you're still resentful\n\n04:13.900 --> 04:16.920\n of something someone did to you in the 14th century,\n\n04:16.920 --> 04:19.000\n but it would compound.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:22.400\n Well, if you repeat the same thing over and over and over,\n\n04:22.400 --> 04:23.840\n there would be no difference.\n\n04:23.840 --> 04:26.860\n Maybe you would start to appreciate the nuances more,\n\n04:26.860 --> 04:29.600\n like when you watch the same movie over and over and over,\n\n04:29.600 --> 04:34.600\n maybe you'll get to actually let go of this idea\n\n04:35.520 --> 04:38.860\n of all the possible, all the positive possibilities\n\n04:38.860 --> 04:39.700\n that lay before you,\n\n04:39.700 --> 04:41.400\n but actually enjoy the moment much more.\n\n04:41.400 --> 04:44.320\n If you remember that you've lived this life a thousand times,\n\n04:44.320 --> 04:47.260\n all the little things, the way somebody smiles,\n\n04:47.260 --> 04:49.560\n if you're been abused, the way somebody,\n\n04:49.560 --> 04:53.360\n like the pain of it, the suffering, the down that you feel,\n\n04:53.360 --> 04:56.340\n the experience of sadness, depression, fear,\n\n04:56.340 --> 04:57.180\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n04:57.180 --> 04:59.920\n You get to really, you get to also appreciate\n\n04:59.920 --> 05:02.720\n that that's part of life, part of being alive.\n\n05:02.720 --> 05:04.880\n Now, also in his experiment, if I was gonna,\n\n05:04.880 --> 05:07.640\n and I love the experiment from the perspective of like,\n\n05:07.640 --> 05:10.320\n just where technology is now and simulation theory\n\n05:10.320 --> 05:11.160\n and stuff like that.\n\n05:11.160 --> 05:14.200\n But in that thought experiment,\n\n05:14.200 --> 05:19.200\n if this rotten demon immediately killed you,\n\n05:19.840 --> 05:23.200\n then within that, it's a little more horrifying\n\n05:23.200 --> 05:26.840\n because even in the, first of all,\n\n05:26.840 --> 05:28.520\n you're trusting a fucking demon.\n\n05:28.520 --> 05:29.680\n Why are you talking to a demon?\n\n05:29.680 --> 05:30.520\n Let's start there.\n\n05:30.520 --> 05:31.640\n Yeah, because that is gonna be,\n\n05:31.640 --> 05:33.800\n even before I get into like the metaphysics\n\n05:33.800 --> 05:36.960\n and like the implications and where is this life stored?\n\n05:36.960 --> 05:38.040\n Where's the loop stored?\n\n05:38.040 --> 05:41.240\n I mean, are we talking about some kind of unchanging data set\n\n05:41.240 --> 05:42.320\n or something?\n\n05:42.320 --> 05:43.160\n For that, you're like,\n\n05:43.160 --> 05:45.360\n why is there a fucking talking demon in my room\n\n05:45.360 --> 05:47.060\n trying to freak me out?\n\n05:47.060 --> 05:48.660\n You're gonna wanna autopsy the demon.\n\n05:48.660 --> 05:49.500\n Can you catch it?\n\n05:49.500 --> 05:50.680\n Does this apply to you, demon?\n\n05:50.680 --> 05:53.440\n And again, obviously it's a fucking thought experiment.\n\n05:53.440 --> 05:54.720\n Nietzsche would be annoyed by me,\n\n05:54.720 --> 05:58.840\n but I think like you would still be able to entertain\n\n05:58.840 --> 06:01.680\n the joy, you'd have the joy\n\n06:01.680 --> 06:03.520\n of not knowing what's around the corner.\n\n06:03.520 --> 06:05.640\n You know, still, it's not like you know what's coming\n\n06:05.640 --> 06:08.240\n just cause the demon said some kind of loop.\n\n06:08.240 --> 06:10.480\n In other words, the idea of being damned\n\n06:10.480 --> 06:13.960\n to your past decisions, it doesn't even work\n\n06:13.960 --> 06:15.720\n because you can't remember what decisions\n\n06:15.720 --> 06:17.080\n you're about to make.\n\n06:17.080 --> 06:19.240\n So from that perspective also,\n\n06:19.240 --> 06:20.720\n I think I'd be happy about it.\n\n06:20.720 --> 06:22.360\n Or I would just think, oh cool.\n\n06:22.360 --> 06:23.420\n I mean, it's a good story.\n\n06:23.420 --> 06:24.920\n I'm gonna tell people about how this.\n\n06:24.920 --> 06:27.120\n I wonder what the demon would actually look like in real life\n\n06:27.120 --> 06:30.680\n cause I suspect that would look like a charming,\n\n06:30.680 --> 06:32.280\n like a friend.\n\n06:32.280 --> 06:34.400\n Wouldn't they be a loved one?\n\n06:34.400 --> 06:37.520\n Wouldn't the demon come to you through the mechanism,\n\n06:37.520 --> 06:41.000\n through the front door of love, not through the back door\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:44.480\n of evil, like malevolent manipulation?\n\n06:44.480 --> 06:46.760\n Sure, I mean, if it's the truth,\n\n06:46.760 --> 06:50.280\n if it's the truth and that's whether it's love or not,\n\n06:50.280 --> 06:53.400\n it's still good fundamentally.\n\n06:53.400 --> 06:56.060\n I do like the idea of the memory replay.\n\n06:56.060 --> 07:00.240\n I remember I went to a Newer Link event a few years ago\n\n07:00.240 --> 07:02.900\n and got to hang out with Elon.\n\n07:02.900 --> 07:06.440\n I remember how visceral it is that there's like a pig\n\n07:06.440 --> 07:09.400\n with a Newer Link in it.\n\n07:09.400 --> 07:13.080\n And you're talking about memory replays as a future,\n\n07:13.080 --> 07:15.240\n maybe far future possibility.\n\n07:15.240 --> 07:17.960\n And you realize, well, this is a very meaningful moment\n\n07:17.960 --> 07:19.360\n in my life.\n\n07:19.360 --> 07:21.140\n This could be a replay.\n\n07:21.140 --> 07:25.440\n Of all the things you replay, it's probably,\n\n07:25.440 --> 07:28.080\n there's certain magical moments in your life.\n\n07:28.080 --> 07:30.720\n Whatever it is, certain people you've met for the first time\n\n07:30.720 --> 07:33.120\n or certain things you've done for the first time\n\n07:33.120 --> 07:36.360\n with certain people or just an awesome thing you did.\n\n07:36.360 --> 07:38.400\n And I remember just saying to him,\n\n07:38.400 --> 07:41.440\n like, I would probably want to replay this,\n\n07:43.080 --> 07:44.080\n this moment.\n\n07:44.080 --> 07:46.320\n And it just seemed very kind of,\n\n07:47.560 --> 07:49.120\n I mean, there was a recursive nature to it,\n\n07:49.120 --> 07:52.960\n but it seemed very real that this is something\n\n07:52.960 --> 07:56.280\n we would want to do, that the richness of life\n\n07:56.280 --> 07:59.560\n could be experienced through the replay.\n\n07:59.560 --> 08:02.200\n That's probably where it's experienced the most.\n\n08:02.200 --> 08:04.280\n You could see life as a way to collect\n\n08:04.280 --> 08:06.760\n a bunch of cool memories, and then you get to sit back\n\n08:06.760 --> 08:10.240\n in your nice VR headset and replay the cool ones.\n\n08:10.240 --> 08:11.280\n That's right.\n\n08:11.280 --> 08:16.120\n This is, in Buddhism, the idea that I struggle with\n\n08:16.120 --> 08:20.620\n is that there's a possibility of not reincarnating,\n\n08:20.620 --> 08:21.640\n of not coming back.\n\n08:21.640 --> 08:22.720\n That's the idea.\n\n08:24.080 --> 08:25.180\n This is suffering here.\n\n08:25.180 --> 08:27.240\n The suffering is caused by attachment.\n\n08:27.240 --> 08:32.240\n And so if you like revise the idea of reincarnation\n\n08:32.560 --> 08:37.560\n or the Nietzsche's loop and look at it from,\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:39.240\n could this be possible?\n\n08:39.240 --> 08:42.440\n Or how would this be possible technologically?\n\n08:42.440 --> 08:45.920\n Then to me, it makes a lot of sense.\n\n08:45.920 --> 08:48.600\n Like I've been thinking a lot about this very thing\n\n08:48.600 --> 08:51.640\n and the Nietzsche's idea connecting to it.\n\n08:51.640 --> 08:54.920\n I had this like, it sounds so dumb,\n\n08:54.920 --> 08:58.280\n but I was at the dentist getting nitrous oxide,\n\n08:58.280 --> 08:59.920\n high as a fucking kite, man.\n\n08:59.920 --> 09:03.880\n And I had this idea, I was thinking about data.\n\n09:03.880 --> 09:07.700\n I was thinking like, man, probably, if I had to bet,\n\n09:07.700 --> 09:11.320\n there's some energetic form that we're not aware of\n\n09:11.320 --> 09:14.160\n that for a super advanced technology\n\n09:14.160 --> 09:17.640\n would be as detectable as like starlight,\n\n09:17.640 --> 09:19.960\n but something that we just don't even know what it is.\n\n09:19.960 --> 09:22.160\n Quantum turbulence, who the fuck knows?\n\n09:22.160 --> 09:24.440\n Fill in the blank, whatever that X may be.\n\n09:24.440 --> 09:27.820\n But assuming that exists, that somehow data,\n\n09:27.820 --> 09:30.680\n even the most subtle things, the tiniest movements,\n\n09:30.680 --> 09:31.960\n whatever it may be,\n\n09:31.960 --> 09:36.080\n the emanations of your neurological process energetically,\n\n09:36.080 --> 09:39.420\n whatever it may be, is radiating out in the space time,\n\n09:39.420 --> 09:44.360\n then what if like the James Webb version of this\n\n09:44.360 --> 09:47.380\n for some advanced civilization is not that they're like\n\n09:47.380 --> 09:50.320\n looking at the nebula or whatever,\n\n09:50.320 --> 09:53.120\n but they're actually able to peer into the past\n\n09:53.120 --> 09:57.200\n and via some bizarre technology recreate whatever life,\n\n09:57.200 --> 09:59.640\n simulate whatever life was happening there\n\n09:59.640 --> 10:02.840\n just by decoding that quantum energy, whatever it is.\n\n10:02.840 --> 10:04.940\n I'm only saying quantum because it's what dumb people say\n\n10:04.940 --> 10:05.780\n when they don't know.\n\n10:05.780 --> 10:07.400\n You just say quantum, I don't know.\n\n10:07.400 --> 10:08.560\n But you know what I mean?\n\n10:08.560 --> 10:09.480\n You're decoding that.\n\n10:09.480 --> 10:12.520\n So meaning, in simulation theory,\n\n10:12.520 --> 10:16.720\n one of the big questions that pops up is why\n\n10:16.720 --> 10:18.120\n and are we in one?\n\n10:18.120 --> 10:19.920\n And Elon has talked about,\n\n10:19.920 --> 10:21.240\n well, it's probably more of a probability\n\n10:21.240 --> 10:24.120\n than we're in one than we're not, in which case,\n\n10:24.120 --> 10:27.400\n what you're talking about is actually happening,\n\n10:27.400 --> 10:30.040\n that that loop you're talking about,\n\n10:30.040 --> 10:32.520\n we've decided to be here.\n\n10:32.520 --> 10:36.240\n This, of all the things, we decided this one,\n\n10:36.240 --> 10:37.540\n oh, let's do that one again.\n\n10:37.540 --> 10:38.480\n I wanna do that one.\n\n10:38.480 --> 10:40.680\n Let's try, let's do that.\n\n10:40.680 --> 10:44.000\n I love thinking about this because I love my family.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.920\n And it makes sense to me that if I'm going to replay\n\n10:46.920 --> 10:49.680\n some life or another, it's definitely gonna be this one\n\n10:49.680 --> 10:51.560\n with my kids, my wife,\n\n10:51.560 --> 10:53.500\n with all the bullshit that's gone along with it,\n\n10:53.500 --> 10:55.160\n I'm still gonna wanna come back.\n\n10:55.160 --> 10:57.360\n So in Buddhism, that's attachment.\n\n10:57.360 --> 10:58.840\n Yeah, but you weren't the one,\n\n10:58.840 --> 11:00.440\n oh, you're saying that you're the main player,\n\n11:00.440 --> 11:01.820\n you're not the NPC.\n\n11:01.820 --> 11:04.720\n Well, I think we're dealing with all NPCs at this point.\n\n11:04.720 --> 11:06.360\n I mean, depending on how you wanna,\n\n11:06.360 --> 11:08.800\n like very, I would say very advanced NPCs,\n\n11:08.800 --> 11:11.460\n like incredibly advanced NPCs\n\n11:11.460 --> 11:14.200\n compared to Fallout or something.\n\n11:14.200 --> 11:17.240\n We've got a lot of conversation options happening here.\n\n11:17.240 --> 11:20.680\n There's not like four things you can pick from.\n\n11:20.680 --> 11:23.720\n Yeah, there's a whole illusion of free will\n\n11:23.720 --> 11:24.660\n that's happening.\n\n11:24.660 --> 11:28.320\n We really do, depending where you are in the world,\n\n11:28.320 --> 11:31.000\n feel like you're free to decide any trajectory\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:32.100\n in your life that you want.\n\n11:32.100 --> 11:33.600\n Which is pretty funny, right?\n\n11:33.600 --> 11:36.080\n For an NPC, it's pretty, it's nice.\n\n11:36.080 --> 11:37.120\n Well, you're gonna want that.\n\n11:37.120 --> 11:38.240\n If we're making a video game,\n\n11:38.240 --> 11:41.560\n you do wanna give your NPCs the illusion of free will\n\n11:41.560 --> 11:44.120\n because it's gonna make interactions with them\n\n11:44.120 --> 11:47.440\n that much more intense.\n\n11:47.440 --> 11:52.180\n Yeah, so I wonder on the path to that,\n\n11:52.180 --> 11:54.340\n how hard is it to create,\n\n11:54.340 --> 11:56.160\n this is sort of the Carmack question\n\n11:56.160 --> 12:01.160\n of a realistic virtual world that's as cool as this one.\n\n12:02.020 --> 12:05.800\n Not fully realistic, but sufficiently realistic\n\n12:05.800 --> 12:08.760\n that it's as interesting to live in.\n\n12:08.760 --> 12:11.040\n Because we're gonna have to create those worlds\n\n12:11.040 --> 12:15.040\n on the path to creating something like a simulation.\n\n12:15.040 --> 12:17.040\n Like long, long, long before.\n\n12:17.040 --> 12:20.080\n It'd be virtual worlds where we'd wanna stay forever\n\n12:20.080 --> 12:25.080\n because they're full of that balance of suffering and joy,\n\n12:27.240 --> 12:29.920\n of limitations and freedoms and all that kind of stuff.\n\n12:29.920 --> 12:32.160\n A lot of people think like in the virtual world,\n\n12:32.160 --> 12:35.320\n I can't wait to be able to, I don't know,\n\n12:35.320 --> 12:39.840\n have sex with anybody I want or have anything I want.\n\n12:39.840 --> 12:42.560\n But I think that's not gonna be fun.\n\n12:42.560 --> 12:44.920\n You want the limitations, the constraints.\n\n12:44.920 --> 12:47.120\n So you have to battle for the things you want.\n\n12:47.120 --> 12:50.640\n Okay, but, okay, but great video games.\n\n12:50.640 --> 12:52.480\n One of my favorite video game memories\n\n12:52.480 --> 12:54.620\n was like I started playing World of Warcraft\n\n12:54.620 --> 12:57.800\n in its original incarnation.\n\n12:57.800 --> 12:59.360\n And I didn't even know\n\n12:59.360 --> 13:01.100\n that you were gonna have flying mounts.\n\n13:01.100 --> 13:02.160\n Like I didn't even know.\n\n13:02.160 --> 13:03.680\n So I've been running around dealing\n\n13:03.680 --> 13:07.440\n with all the encumbrances of like being an undead warlock\n\n13:07.440 --> 13:08.700\n that can't fly.\n\n13:08.700 --> 13:12.120\n But then all of a sudden, holy shit, there's flying mounts.\n\n13:12.120 --> 13:15.000\n And now the world you've been running around not flying,\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:16.520\n you're seeing it from the top down.\n\n13:16.520 --> 13:18.160\n It was just really cool.\n\n13:18.160 --> 13:19.920\n Like, whoa, I could do this now.\n\n13:19.920 --> 13:21.680\n And then that gets boring.\n\n13:21.680 --> 13:24.240\n But a really well designed game,\n\n13:24.240 --> 13:28.880\n it has a series of these, I don't know what you call it,\n\n13:28.880 --> 13:33.200\n extra abilities that kind of unfold and produce novelty.\n\n13:33.200 --> 13:35.800\n And then eventually you just accept it,\n\n13:35.800 --> 13:37.060\n you take it for granted.\n\n13:37.060 --> 13:40.280\n And then another novelty appears.\n\n13:40.280 --> 13:42.040\n Those extra abilities are always balanced\n\n13:42.040 --> 13:44.860\n with the limitations, the constraints they run up against.\n\n13:44.860 --> 13:48.240\n Because a well balanced video game,\n\n13:48.240 --> 13:51.480\n the challenge, the struggle matches the new ability.\n\n13:51.480 --> 13:54.580\n Yeah, and sometimes causes problems on its own.\n\n13:54.580 --> 13:59.280\n I mean, and so to go back to this universe, this simulation,\n\n13:59.280 --> 14:02.660\n it's really designed like a pretty awesome video game.\n\n14:02.660 --> 14:05.860\n If you look at it from the perspective of history,\n\n14:05.860 --> 14:08.360\n I mean, people were on horses.\n\n14:08.360 --> 14:10.560\n They didn't know that they were gonna be bullet trains.\n\n14:10.560 --> 14:12.960\n They didn't know that you could get in a car\n\n14:12.960 --> 14:15.880\n and drive across the country in a few days.\n\n14:15.880 --> 14:17.480\n That would have sounded ridiculous.\n\n14:17.480 --> 14:18.580\n We're doing that now.\n\n14:18.580 --> 14:21.800\n And even in our own lifespan, think about it.\n\n14:21.800 --> 14:24.400\n How long has VR goggles existed?\n\n14:24.400 --> 14:27.480\n Like the ones that you could just buy at Best Buy.\n\n14:27.480 --> 14:31.380\n I had the original Oculus Rift, the fucking puke machine.\n\n14:31.380 --> 14:34.040\n You put that thing on, I gave it to my friend.\n\n14:34.040 --> 14:36.440\n He went and vomited in my driveway\n\n14:36.440 --> 14:38.640\n and people were making fun of it.\n\n14:38.640 --> 14:40.080\n They were saying, this isn't gonna catch on.\n\n14:40.080 --> 14:43.720\n It's too big, it's unwieldy, the graphics suck.\n\n14:43.720 --> 14:45.720\n And then look at where it's at now.\n\n14:45.720 --> 14:48.040\n And that's going to keep,\n\n14:48.040 --> 14:50.120\n that trajectory is gonna keep improving.\n\n14:50.120 --> 14:53.120\n So yeah, I think that we are dealing\n\n14:53.120 --> 14:54.200\n with what you're talking about,\n\n14:54.200 --> 14:59.200\n which is novelty met with more problems, met with novelty.\n\n14:59.600 --> 15:01.980\n Yeah, I wonder why VR is not more popular.\n\n15:01.980 --> 15:05.380\n I wonder what is going to be the magic thing\n\n15:05.380 --> 15:10.380\n that really convinces a large fraction of the world\n\n15:10.640 --> 15:13.140\n to move into the virtual world.\n\n15:13.140 --> 15:16.780\n I suppose we're already there in the 2D screen\n\n15:16.780 --> 15:19.740\n of Twitter and social media and that kind of stuff.\n\n15:19.740 --> 15:21.400\n And even video games, there's a lot of people\n\n15:21.400 --> 15:26.200\n that get a big sense of community from video games.\n\n15:26.200 --> 15:29.500\n But like, it doesn't feel like you're living there.\n\n15:29.500 --> 15:34.500\n It's like, bye mom, I'm going to this other world.\n\n15:35.760 --> 15:37.900\n Or like you leave your girlfriend\n\n15:37.900 --> 15:40.380\n to go get your digital girlfriend.\n\n15:40.380 --> 15:41.680\n That's gonna be a problem.\n\n15:41.680 --> 15:43.580\n There's less jealousy in the digital world.\n\n15:43.580 --> 15:45.380\n Maybe there should be a lot of jealousy\n\n15:45.380 --> 15:46.380\n in the digital world.\n\n15:46.380 --> 15:49.860\n Cause that's jealousy, a little jealousy\n\n15:49.860 --> 15:52.300\n is probably good for relationships,\n\n15:52.300 --> 15:54.260\n even in the digital world.\n\n15:54.260 --> 15:56.220\n So you're gonna have to simulate all of that kind of stuff.\n\n15:56.220 --> 15:58.440\n But I wonder what the magic thing that says,\n\n15:58.440 --> 16:01.560\n I wanna spend most of my days inside the virtual world.\n\n16:01.560 --> 16:05.620\n Well, clearly it's gonna be something we don't have yet.\n\n16:05.620 --> 16:07.740\n I mean, strapping that damn thing on your face\n\n16:07.740 --> 16:08.700\n still feels weird.\n\n16:08.700 --> 16:09.940\n It's heavy.\n\n16:09.940 --> 16:12.380\n If you're depending on what gear you're using,\n\n16:12.380 --> 16:13.940\n sometimes light can leak in.\n\n16:13.940 --> 16:15.620\n There's just, you gotta recharge it.\n\n16:15.620 --> 16:16.920\n It's hyper limited.\n\n16:16.920 --> 16:21.920\n And then, so yeah, it's gonna have to be something\n\n16:23.380 --> 16:27.580\n that like simulates taste, smell.\n\n16:27.580 --> 16:29.380\n You think taste and smell are important touch?\n\n16:29.380 --> 16:30.860\n I do, yeah.\n\n16:30.860 --> 16:34.580\n I can't just do, in World War II, you would write letters.\n\n16:34.580 --> 16:36.660\n You could still, don't you think you can convey love\n\n16:36.660 --> 16:38.140\n with just words?\n\n16:38.140 --> 16:39.300\n For sure.\n\n16:39.300 --> 16:42.140\n But I think for what you're talking about to happen,\n\n16:42.140 --> 16:45.180\n it has to be fully immersive.\n\n16:45.180 --> 16:49.300\n So that it's not that you feel like you're walking\n\n16:49.300 --> 16:50.640\n cause it looks like you're walking,\n\n16:50.640 --> 16:52.740\n but that your brain is sending signals\n\n16:52.740 --> 16:54.960\n telling your body that you're walking,\n\n16:54.960 --> 16:57.220\n that you feel the wind blowing in your face,\n\n16:57.220 --> 16:58.940\n not because of some, I don't know,\n\n16:58.940 --> 17:01.260\n fan or something that it's connected to,\n\n17:01.260 --> 17:03.940\n but because somehow it's figured out\n\n17:03.940 --> 17:06.740\n how to hack into the human brain\n\n17:06.740 --> 17:10.460\n and send those signals minus some external thing.\n\n17:10.460 --> 17:13.960\n Once that happens, I'd say we're gonna see\n\n17:13.960 --> 17:18.380\n a complete radical shift in everything.\n\n17:18.380 --> 17:19.540\n See, I disagree with you.\n\n17:19.540 --> 17:21.380\n I don't know if you've seen the movie Her.\n\n17:21.380 --> 17:22.540\n Yeah.\n\n17:22.540 --> 17:24.520\n I think you can go to another world\n\n17:24.520 --> 17:27.340\n in where a digital being lives in the darkness\n\n17:27.340 --> 17:32.060\n and all you hear is Scarlett Johansson voice talking to you\n\n17:32.060 --> 17:34.740\n and she lives there or he lives there,\n\n17:34.740 --> 17:37.160\n your friend, your loved one,\n\n17:38.140 --> 17:40.060\n and all you have is voice and words.\n\n17:40.060 --> 17:42.540\n And I think that could be sufficient\n\n17:42.540 --> 17:44.140\n to pull you into that world\n\n17:44.140 --> 17:47.300\n where you look forward to that moment all day.\n\n17:47.300 --> 17:49.460\n You never wanna leave the darkness,\n\n17:49.460 --> 17:51.620\n just closing your eyes and listening to the voice.\n\n17:51.620 --> 17:55.660\n I think those basic mediums of communication\n\n17:55.660 --> 17:56.500\n is still enough.\n\n17:56.500 --> 17:58.580\n Like language is really, really powerful.\n\n17:58.580 --> 18:00.940\n And I think the realism of touch and smell\n\n18:00.940 --> 18:02.700\n and all that kind of stuff\n\n18:02.700 --> 18:04.540\n is not nearly as powerful as language.\n\n18:04.540 --> 18:07.260\n That's what makes humans really special\n\n18:07.260 --> 18:09.580\n is our ability to communicate with each other.\n\n18:09.580 --> 18:12.460\n That's the sense of like deep connection we get\n\n18:12.460 --> 18:13.800\n is through communication.\n\n18:13.800 --> 18:16.140\n Now that communication could involve touch.\n\n18:16.140 --> 18:20.300\n Like, you know, hugging feels damn good.\n\n18:20.300 --> 18:21.860\n You see a good friend, you hug.\n\n18:22.900 --> 18:25.980\n That's one of the big things with doing COVID with Rogan.\n\n18:25.980 --> 18:29.100\n When you see him, there's a giant hug coming your way\n\n18:29.100 --> 18:33.340\n and that makes you feel like, yeah, this feels great.\n\n18:33.340 --> 18:36.020\n But I think that can be just with language.\n\n18:36.020 --> 18:40.800\n I think for a lot of people that's true,\n\n18:40.800 --> 18:45.800\n but we're talking like massive adoption\n\n18:46.140 --> 18:49.060\n of a technology by the world.\n\n18:49.060 --> 18:51.800\n And if language was just enough,\n\n18:52.980 --> 18:55.500\n we wouldn't be selling TVs.\n\n18:55.500 --> 18:57.660\n People will be reading.\n\n18:57.660 --> 19:01.220\n They wanna watch, they wanna see, you know?\n\n19:01.220 --> 19:02.620\n But I agree with you, man.\n\n19:02.620 --> 19:04.500\n When you're getting absorbed into a book\n\n19:04.500 --> 19:06.140\n and especially if you've got,\n\n19:06.140 --> 19:08.740\n I think a lot of us went through a weird dark ages\n\n19:08.740 --> 19:09.980\n when it came to reading.\n\n19:09.980 --> 19:12.440\n Like when I was a kid and there wasn't the option\n\n19:12.440 --> 19:16.140\n for these hypno rectangles, that's just what you did.\n\n19:16.140 --> 19:17.780\n There wasn't even anything special about it.\n\n19:17.780 --> 19:19.500\n What's a hypno rectangle? Your phone.\n\n19:19.500 --> 19:20.820\n You know, it was like, you didn't,\n\n19:20.820 --> 19:22.060\n when that gravity well.\n\n19:22.060 --> 19:24.340\n Hypno rectangle, gravity well.\n\n19:24.340 --> 19:26.340\n It is. Attention, gravity well, yeah.\n\n19:26.340 --> 19:28.260\n When we weren't feeling the pull of these things\n\n19:28.260 --> 19:30.540\n all the time, you would just read\n\n19:30.540 --> 19:33.100\n and you weren't patting yourself on the back about reading.\n\n19:33.100 --> 19:34.380\n You just, that's what you had.\n\n19:34.380 --> 19:37.740\n You had that and you had like eight channels on the TV\n\n19:37.740 --> 19:39.340\n and a shitty VCR.\n\n19:39.340 --> 19:42.440\n So, you know, then a lot of people stop reading\n\n19:42.440 --> 19:43.660\n because of these things, you know,\n\n19:43.660 --> 19:44.620\n or they think they're reading\n\n19:44.620 --> 19:47.940\n because they are technically reading, but you know,\n\n19:47.940 --> 19:51.940\n when you return to reading after a pause, whoa,\n\n19:51.940 --> 19:54.540\n and you realize how powerful this simulator is\n\n19:54.540 --> 19:57.300\n when it's given the right code of language,\n\n19:57.300 --> 19:59.580\n whoa, holy shit, it's incredible.\n\n19:59.580 --> 20:03.500\n I mean, it's like, again, it's the most embarrassing\n\n20:03.500 --> 20:06.060\n kind of like, whoa, wow, what do you know?\n\n20:06.060 --> 20:07.700\n Books are really good.\n\n20:07.700 --> 20:09.660\n But still, if you've been away from it for a while\n\n20:09.660 --> 20:11.940\n and you revisit it, I know what you're saying.\n\n20:11.940 --> 20:16.660\n I just think probably it's not gonna go in that direction,\n\n20:16.660 --> 20:18.060\n even though you are right.\n\n20:18.060 --> 20:19.660\n Ultimately, I think you're right.\n\n20:19.660 --> 20:23.780\n Yeah, because our brain is the imagination engine we have\n\n20:23.780 --> 20:25.380\n is able to fill in the gaps better\n\n20:25.380 --> 20:27.780\n than a lot of graphics engines could.\n\n20:27.780 --> 20:30.060\n And so if there's a way to incentivize humans\n\n20:30.060 --> 20:33.000\n to become addicted to the use of imagination,\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:36.080\n it's like, you know, that's the downside of things like porn\n\n20:36.080 --> 20:39.380\n that remove the need for imagination for people.\n\n20:39.380 --> 20:41.000\n And in that same way, video games\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:43.740\n that are becoming ultra realistic,\n\n20:43.740 --> 20:45.180\n you don't have to imagine anything.\n\n20:45.180 --> 20:48.660\n And I feel like the imagination is a really powerful tool\n\n20:48.660 --> 20:50.120\n that needs to be leveraged.\n\n20:50.120 --> 20:53.560\n Because to simulate reality sufficiently realistically\n\n20:53.560 --> 20:57.820\n that we would be perfectly fooled,\n\n20:57.820 --> 20:59.860\n technically it's very hard.\n\n20:59.860 --> 21:03.820\n And so I think we need to somehow leverage imagination.\n\n21:03.820 --> 21:06.280\n Sure, I mean, yeah, I mean, this is like,\n\n21:06.280 --> 21:10.480\n this is what I love and is so creepy\n\n21:10.480 --> 21:15.400\n about like the current AI chatbots, you know,\n\n21:15.400 --> 21:16.540\n is that it's like,\n\n21:16.540 --> 21:18.280\n it's the relationship between you and the thing\n\n21:18.280 --> 21:21.800\n and the way that it can via whatever the algorithms are.\n\n21:21.800 --> 21:24.940\n And by the way, I have no idea how these things work, you do.\n\n21:24.940 --> 21:27.500\n I just, you know, speculate about what they mean\n\n21:27.500 --> 21:28.340\n or where it's going.\n\n21:28.340 --> 21:30.240\n But there's something about the relation\n\n21:30.240 --> 21:35.000\n between the consumer and the technology.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.160\n And when that technology starts shifting\n\n21:37.160 --> 21:40.080\n according to what it perceives\n\n21:40.080 --> 21:43.760\n that the consumer is looking for or isn't looking for,\n\n21:43.760 --> 21:47.360\n then at that point, I think that's where you run into the,\n\n21:48.240 --> 21:49.880\n you know, yeah, it doesn't matter\n\n21:49.880 --> 21:54.280\n if the reality that you're in is like photo realism\n\n21:54.280 --> 21:56.560\n for it to be sticky and immersive.\n\n21:56.560 --> 21:59.920\n It's when the reality that you're in is via cues\n\n21:59.920 --> 22:01.640\n you might not even be aware of,\n\n22:01.640 --> 22:06.280\n or via your digital imprint on Facebook or wherever,\n\n22:06.280 --> 22:11.200\n when it's warping itself to that to seduce you,\n\n22:11.200 --> 22:15.040\n holy shit, man, that's where it becomes something alien,\n\n22:15.040 --> 22:17.440\n something, you know, when you're reading a book,\n\n22:18.360 --> 22:21.760\n obviously the book is not shifting\n\n22:21.760 --> 22:23.740\n according to its perception\n\n22:23.740 --> 22:26.640\n of what parts of the book you like.\n\n22:26.640 --> 22:28.760\n But when you imagine that,\n\n22:28.760 --> 22:30.580\n imagine a book that could do that,\n\n22:30.580 --> 22:32.760\n a book that could sense somehow\n\n22:32.760 --> 22:34.280\n that you're really enjoying this character\n\n22:34.280 --> 22:35.860\n more than another, you know?\n\n22:35.860 --> 22:37.920\n And depending on the style of book,\n\n22:38.980 --> 22:40.720\n kills that fucking character off\n\n22:40.720 --> 22:43.080\n or lets that character continue.\n\n22:43.080 --> 22:48.080\n I mean, that to me is sort of the where AI and VR,\n\n22:48.680 --> 22:51.720\n when those two things come together,\n\n22:51.720 --> 22:54.780\n whoa, man, that's where you're in,\n\n22:54.780 --> 22:56.520\n that's where you really are gonna find yourself\n\n22:56.520 --> 22:58.120\n in a Skinner box, you know?\n\n22:58.120 --> 23:03.120\n So the dynamic storytelling that senses your anxiety\n\n23:03.680 --> 23:06.240\n and tries to, there's a kind of this,\n\n23:06.240 --> 23:08.680\n in psychology, this arousal curve.\n\n23:08.680 --> 23:10.800\n So there's a dynamic storytelling\n\n23:10.800 --> 23:12.440\n that keeps you sufficiently aroused\n\n23:12.440 --> 23:14.560\n in terms of, not sexually aroused,\n\n23:14.560 --> 23:16.080\n like in terms of anxiety,\n\n23:16.080 --> 23:18.240\n but not too much where you freak out.\n\n23:18.240 --> 23:21.420\n It's this perfect balance where you're always on edge,\n\n23:21.420 --> 23:23.720\n excited, scared, that kind of stuff,\n\n23:23.720 --> 23:25.040\n and the story unrolls.\n\n23:25.040 --> 23:27.140\n It breaks your heart to where you're pissed,\n\n23:27.140 --> 23:29.080\n but then it makes you feel good again,\n\n23:29.080 --> 23:30.600\n and finds that balance.\n\n23:30.600 --> 23:32.060\n Yeah.\n\n23:32.060 --> 23:33.600\n The chatbots scare you, though?\n\n23:34.800 --> 23:36.920\n I'd love to sort of hear your thoughts\n\n23:36.920 --> 23:38.240\n about where they are today,\n\n23:38.240 --> 23:41.180\n because there is a different perspective\n\n23:41.180 --> 23:44.880\n we have on this thing, because I do know,\n\n23:44.880 --> 23:47.720\n and I'm excited about a lot of the different technologies\n\n23:47.720 --> 23:52.720\n that feed AI systems, that feed these kind of chatbots.\n\n23:52.720 --> 23:55.920\n And you're more a little bit, on the consumer side,\n\n23:55.920 --> 23:58.280\n you're a philosopher of sorts.\n\n23:58.280 --> 24:01.720\n They're able to interact with AI systems,\n\n24:01.720 --> 24:05.280\n but also able to introspect about the negative\n\n24:05.280 --> 24:07.360\n and the positive things about those AI systems.\n\n24:07.360 --> 24:10.560\n There's that story with a Google engineer saying that.\n\n24:10.560 --> 24:12.160\n I had him on my podcast, Blake Lemoine.\n\n24:12.160 --> 24:13.000\n You did.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:13.840\n What was that like?\n\n24:13.840 --> 24:17.040\n What was your perspective of that,\n\n24:17.040 --> 24:19.880\n looking at that as a particular example\n\n24:19.880 --> 24:24.640\n of a human being being captivated\n\n24:24.640 --> 24:26.960\n by the interactions with an AI system?\n\n24:26.960 --> 24:31.840\n Well, number one, when you hear that anyone is claiming\n\n24:31.840 --> 24:35.000\n that an AI has become sentient,\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.240\n you should be skeptical about that.\n\n24:37.240 --> 24:39.960\n I mean, this is a good thing to be skeptical about,\n\n24:39.960 --> 24:42.000\n and so initially when I heard that,\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:45.120\n I was like, ah, it's probably just, who knows?\n\n24:45.120 --> 24:46.960\n Somebody who's a little confused or something.\n\n24:46.960 --> 24:49.380\n So when you're talking to them and you realize,\n\n24:49.380 --> 24:51.440\n oh, not only is he not confused,\n\n24:51.440 --> 24:54.400\n he's also open to all possibilities.\n\n24:54.400 --> 24:57.060\n He doesn't seem like he's super committed\n\n24:57.060 --> 24:59.360\n other than the fact that he's like, this is my experience.\n\n24:59.360 --> 25:00.760\n This is what's happening.\n\n25:00.760 --> 25:01.920\n This is what it is.\n\n25:01.920 --> 25:05.080\n So to me, there's something really cool about that,\n\n25:05.080 --> 25:08.480\n which is like, oh shit, I don't get to lean into like,\n\n25:08.480 --> 25:12.260\n I'm not quite sure your perceptual apparatus\n\n25:12.260 --> 25:15.380\n is necessarily like, I don't,\n\n25:15.380 --> 25:18.080\n you know, in the UFO community,\n\n25:18.080 --> 25:19.680\n I think I've just learned this term.\n\n25:19.680 --> 25:24.540\n It's called, instead of gaslighting, swamp gassing,\n\n25:24.540 --> 25:25.780\n which is, you know what I mean?\n\n25:25.780 --> 25:28.720\n People have this experience, you're like, it was swamp gas.\n\n25:28.720 --> 25:30.080\n You didn't see the thing.\n\n25:30.080 --> 25:33.400\n And you know, skeptical people, we have that tendency.\n\n25:33.400 --> 25:35.560\n If you hear an anomalous experience,\n\n25:35.560 --> 25:39.640\n your first thought more than likely is gonna be really,\n\n25:39.640 --> 25:40.980\n it could have been this or that or whatever.\n\n25:40.980 --> 25:45.980\n So to me, he seems really reliable, friendly, cool,\n\n25:45.980 --> 25:48.580\n and like, it doesn't really seem like\n\n25:48.580 --> 25:49.820\n he has much of an agenda.\n\n25:49.820 --> 25:53.780\n Like, you know, going public about some thing happening\n\n25:53.780 --> 25:56.820\n at Google is not a great thing\n\n25:56.820 --> 25:58.500\n if you wanna keep working at Google.\n\n25:58.500 --> 26:02.360\n You know, it's, I don't know what benefit\n\n26:02.360 --> 26:03.900\n he's getting from it necessarily.\n\n26:03.900 --> 26:05.980\n But all that being said,\n\n26:05.980 --> 26:09.660\n the other thing that's culturally was interesting\n\n26:09.660 --> 26:12.620\n and is interesting about it is the blowback he got,\n\n26:12.620 --> 26:16.740\n the passionate blowback from people\n\n26:16.740 --> 26:20.260\n who hadn't even looked into what Lambda is\n\n26:20.260 --> 26:21.960\n or what he was saying Lambda is,\n\n26:21.960 --> 26:25.220\n which they were like saying, you're talking about,\n\n26:25.220 --> 26:27.600\n and you should have your show actually, but.\n\n26:27.600 --> 26:30.700\n There's complexity on top of complexities.\n\n26:30.700 --> 26:32.620\n For me personally, from different perspectives,\n\n26:32.620 --> 26:35.300\n I also, and sorry if I'm interrupting your flow.\n\n26:35.300 --> 26:37.060\n Please interrupt, it's a podcast.\n\n26:37.060 --> 26:40.240\n Yeah, well, we're having multiple podcasts\n\n26:40.240 --> 26:42.500\n in multiple dimensions and I'm just trying\n\n26:42.500 --> 26:44.980\n to figure out which one we wanna plug into.\n\n26:46.460 --> 26:49.780\n I, because I know how a lot of the language models work\n\n26:49.780 --> 26:53.140\n and I work closely with people\n\n26:53.140 --> 26:56.640\n that really make it their life journey\n\n26:56.640 --> 26:59.700\n to create these NLP systems,\n\n26:59.700 --> 27:01.740\n they're focused on the technical details.\n\n27:01.740 --> 27:04.780\n Like a carpenter's working on Pinocchio\n\n27:04.780 --> 27:06.860\n is crafting the different parts of the wood.\n\n27:06.860 --> 27:09.820\n They don't understand when the whole thing comes together,\n\n27:09.820 --> 27:12.220\n there's a magic that can fill the thing.\n\n27:12.220 --> 27:14.260\n Yeah, I definitely know the tension\n\n27:14.260 --> 27:16.900\n between the engineers that create these systems\n\n27:16.900 --> 27:21.100\n and the actual magic that they can create,\n\n27:21.100 --> 27:22.660\n even when they're dumb.\n\n27:22.660 --> 27:24.460\n I guess that's what I'm trying to say.\n\n27:26.180 --> 27:28.140\n What the engineers often say is like,\n\n27:28.140 --> 27:30.820\n well, these systems are not smart enough\n\n27:30.820 --> 27:34.860\n to have sentience or to have the kind of intelligence\n\n27:34.860 --> 27:36.220\n that you're projecting onto it.\n\n27:36.220 --> 27:38.780\n It's pretty dumb, it's just repeating a bunch of things\n\n27:38.780 --> 27:41.300\n that other humans have said and stitching them together\n\n27:41.300 --> 27:42.900\n in interesting ways that are relevant\n\n27:42.900 --> 27:45.980\n to the context of the conversation, it's not smart.\n\n27:45.980 --> 27:47.060\n It doesn't know how to do math.\n\n27:47.060 --> 27:49.580\n To address that specific critique\n\n27:49.580 --> 27:54.080\n from a non programming person's perspective,\n\n27:56.340 --> 27:58.300\n he addressed this on my podcast, which is,\n\n27:58.300 --> 28:00.340\n okay, what you're talking about there,\n\n28:00.340 --> 28:03.140\n the server that's filled with all the,\n\n28:03.140 --> 28:04.940\n whatever it is, what people have said,\n\n28:04.940 --> 28:08.100\n the repository of questions and responses\n\n28:08.100 --> 28:10.200\n and the algorithm that weaves those things together\n\n28:10.200 --> 28:14.260\n to produce it using some crazy statistical engine,\n\n28:14.260 --> 28:16.580\n which is a miracle in its own right.\n\n28:16.580 --> 28:21.100\n They can like imitate human speech with no sentience.\n\n28:21.100 --> 28:23.980\n I mean, I'm honestly not sure what's more spectacular,\n\n28:23.980 --> 28:25.820\n really the fact that they figured out\n\n28:25.820 --> 28:28.260\n how to do that minus sentience\n\n28:28.260 --> 28:30.900\n or the thing suddenly like having,\n\n28:30.900 --> 28:32.820\n what is more spectacular here?\n\n28:32.820 --> 28:37.140\n Both occurrences are insane, which by the way,\n\n28:37.140 --> 28:40.660\n when you hear people being like, it's not sentient,\n\n28:40.660 --> 28:43.720\n it's like, okay, so it's not sentient.\n\n28:43.720 --> 28:47.940\n So now we have this hyper manipulative algorithm\n\n28:47.940 --> 28:51.340\n that can imitate humans, but it's just code\n\n28:51.340 --> 28:54.500\n and it's like hacking humans via their compassion.\n\n28:54.500 --> 28:57.440\n Holy shit, that's crazy too.\n\n28:57.440 --> 28:59.560\n Both versions of it are nuts,\n\n28:59.560 --> 29:01.740\n but to address what you just said,\n\n29:01.740 --> 29:04.440\n he said that's the common critique is people are like,\n\n29:04.440 --> 29:05.380\n no, you don't understand.\n\n29:05.380 --> 29:07.780\n He's just gotten really good at grabbing shit\n\n29:07.780 --> 29:11.060\n from the database that fits with certain cues\n\n29:11.060 --> 29:12.720\n and then stringing them together\n\n29:12.720 --> 29:14.380\n in a way that makes it seem human.\n\n29:14.380 --> 29:18.080\n He said, that's not when it became awake.\n\n29:18.080 --> 29:21.700\n It became awake when a bunch of those repositories,\n\n29:21.700 --> 29:24.860\n a bunch of the chatbots were connected together.\n\n29:24.860 --> 29:26.700\n That Lambda is sort of an amalgam\n\n29:26.700 --> 29:29.120\n of all the Google chatbots\n\n29:29.120 --> 29:32.500\n and that's when the ghost appeared in the machine\n\n29:32.500 --> 29:35.840\n via the complexity of all the systems being linked up.\n\n29:35.840 --> 29:38.860\n Now, I don't know if that's just like turtles\n\n29:38.860 --> 29:40.620\n all the way down or something, I don't know.\n\n29:40.620 --> 29:42.240\n But I liked what he said,\n\n29:42.240 --> 29:44.440\n because I like the idea of thinking,\n\n29:44.440 --> 29:47.160\n man, if you get enough complexity in a system,\n\n29:47.160 --> 29:50.600\n does it become like the way a sail catches wind,\n\n29:50.600 --> 29:53.740\n except the wind that it's catching is sentience.\n\n29:53.740 --> 29:57.400\n And if sentience is truly embodied,\n\n29:57.400 --> 30:00.540\n it's a neurological byproduct or something,\n\n30:00.540 --> 30:03.460\n then the sail isn't catching some,\n\n30:03.460 --> 30:06.620\n as of yet unquantified disembodied consciousness,\n\n30:06.620 --> 30:08.660\n but it's catching our projections\n\n30:08.660 --> 30:11.660\n in a way that it's gone from being,\n\n30:11.660 --> 30:14.620\n it's a projection sail.\n\n30:14.620 --> 30:17.660\n And then at that point, is there a difference?\n\n30:17.660 --> 30:21.940\n Even if the technology is just a temporary place\n\n30:21.940 --> 30:24.540\n that our sentience is living\n\n30:24.540 --> 30:26.140\n while we're interacting with it.\n\n30:27.540 --> 30:30.300\n Yeah, there's some threshold of complexity with a sail\n\n30:30.300 --> 30:33.500\n is able to pick up the wind of the projections.\n\n30:33.500 --> 30:36.860\n And it pulls us in, it pulls the human,\n\n30:36.860 --> 30:41.780\n it pulls our memories in, it pulls our hopes in, all of it.\n\n30:41.780 --> 30:44.400\n And it's able to now dance with it together\n\n30:44.400 --> 30:46.180\n with those hopes and dreams and so on,\n\n30:46.180 --> 30:48.500\n like we do in that regular conversation.\n\n30:48.500 --> 30:50.900\n His reports, whether true or not,\n\n30:50.900 --> 30:53.020\n whether representative or not, it really doesn't matter\n\n30:53.020 --> 30:56.660\n because to me, it feels like this is coming for sure.\n\n30:56.660 --> 30:59.700\n So this kind of experiences are going to be multiplying.\n\n30:59.700 --> 31:03.900\n The question is at what rate and who gets to control\n\n31:03.900 --> 31:07.540\n the data around those experiences,\n\n31:07.540 --> 31:11.620\n the algorithm about when you turn that on and off,\n\n31:11.620 --> 31:15.260\n because that kind of thing, and as I told you offline,\n\n31:15.260 --> 31:18.380\n I'm very much interested in building those kinds of things,\n\n31:18.380 --> 31:21.220\n especially in the social media context.\n\n31:21.220 --> 31:24.540\n And when it's in the wrong hands,\n\n31:24.540 --> 31:27.500\n I feel like it could be used to manipulate\n\n31:27.500 --> 31:30.220\n a large number of people in a direction\n\n31:30.220 --> 31:35.220\n that has too many unintended consequences.\n\n31:36.020 --> 31:38.140\n I do believe people that own tech companies\n\n31:39.340 --> 31:41.700\n want to do good for the world.\n\n31:41.700 --> 31:45.500\n But as Solzhenitsyn has said,\n\n31:45.500 --> 31:48.780\n the only way you could do evil at a mass scale\n\n31:48.780 --> 31:50.720\n is by believing you're doing good.\n\n31:52.820 --> 31:55.380\n And that's certainly the case for tech companies\n\n31:55.380 --> 31:57.700\n as they get more and more power.\n\n31:57.700 --> 32:00.480\n And there's kind of an ethic of doing good for the world.\n\n32:00.480 --> 32:03.180\n They've convinced themselves that they're doing good.\n\n32:03.180 --> 32:06.060\n And now you're free to do whatever you want\n\n32:06.060 --> 32:07.220\n because you're doing good.\n\n32:07.220 --> 32:09.140\n You know who else thought he was doing good for the world?\n\n32:09.140 --> 32:11.140\n Mythologically, Prometheus.\n\n32:11.140 --> 32:14.100\n He brings us fire, pisses off the fucking gods,\n\n32:14.100 --> 32:15.740\n steals fire from the gods.\n\n32:17.140 --> 32:19.620\n Talk about an upgrade to the simulation.\n\n32:19.620 --> 32:22.300\n Fire, that's a pretty great fucking upgrade\n\n32:22.300 --> 32:24.940\n that does fit into what you were saying.\n\n32:24.940 --> 32:28.580\n We get fire, but now we've got weapons of war\n\n32:28.580 --> 32:30.300\n that have never been seen before.\n\n32:30.300 --> 32:32.340\n And I think that the tech companies\n\n32:32.340 --> 32:34.260\n are much like Prometheus\n\n32:34.260 --> 32:38.060\n in the sense that the myth, at least the story of Prometheus,\n\n32:38.060 --> 32:40.940\n the implication is fire was something\n\n32:40.940 --> 32:44.620\n that was only supposed to be in the hands\n\n32:44.620 --> 32:46.580\n of the immortals, of the gods.\n\n32:46.580 --> 32:50.660\n And now sentience is similar.\n\n32:50.660 --> 32:54.420\n It's fire and it's only supposed to be in the hands of God.\n\n32:54.420 --> 32:58.300\n So yeah, if we're gonna look at the archetype of the thing,\n\n32:58.300 --> 33:01.660\n in general, when you steal this shit from the gods,\n\n33:01.660 --> 33:03.520\n and obviously I'm not saying the tech companies\n\n33:03.520 --> 33:05.200\n are stealing sentience from God,\n\n33:05.200 --> 33:07.340\n which would be pretty bad ass.\n\n33:07.340 --> 33:09.580\n You can expect trouble.\n\n33:09.580 --> 33:11.020\n You can expect trouble.\n\n33:11.020 --> 33:13.500\n And this is what's really, to me,\n\n33:13.500 --> 33:16.920\n one of the cool things about humans is yeah,\n\n33:16.920 --> 33:18.300\n but we're still gonna do it.\n\n33:18.300 --> 33:19.420\n That's what's cool about humans.\n\n33:19.420 --> 33:21.120\n I mean, we wouldn't be here today\n\n33:21.120 --> 33:24.980\n if somebody, the first person to discover fire,\n\n33:24.980 --> 33:26.180\n assuming there was just one person\n\n33:26.180 --> 33:27.140\n who was gonna discover fire,\n\n33:27.140 --> 33:28.460\n which obviously would never happen,\n\n33:28.460 --> 33:30.980\n was like, ah, it's gonna burn a lot of people.\n\n33:30.980 --> 33:33.940\n Or if the first people who started planting seeds were like,\n\n33:33.940 --> 33:35.780\n you know this is gonna lead to capitalism.\n\n33:35.780 --> 33:37.740\n You know this is gonna lead the industrial revolution.\n\n33:37.740 --> 33:39.060\n The plant's gonna eat up right now.\n\n33:39.060 --> 33:41.180\n They just didn't wanna go in the woods to forage.\n\n33:41.180 --> 33:43.460\n So, you know, this is what we do.\n\n33:43.460 --> 33:44.940\n And I agree with you.\n\n33:44.940 --> 33:48.160\n It's like, that's our Game of Thrones winner is coming.\n\n33:48.160 --> 33:50.040\n That's the, it's happening.\n\n33:50.040 --> 33:52.220\n And the tech companies, the hubris,\n\n33:52.220 --> 33:54.740\n which is another way to piss off the gods is hubris.\n\n33:54.740 --> 33:55.800\n So the tech companies,\n\n33:55.800 --> 33:58.020\n I don't know if it's like typical hubris.\n\n33:58.020 --> 33:59.020\n I don't think they're walking around\n\n33:59.020 --> 34:00.460\n thumping their chests or whatever.\n\n34:00.460 --> 34:03.640\n But I do think that the people who are working on\n\n34:03.640 --> 34:05.820\n this kind of super intelligence\n\n34:05.820 --> 34:08.880\n have made a really terrible assumption,\n\n34:08.880 --> 34:11.020\n which is once it goes online\n\n34:11.020 --> 34:13.660\n and once it gets access to all the data,\n\n34:13.660 --> 34:16.820\n that it's not going to find ways out of the box\n\n34:16.820 --> 34:20.780\n that like, you know, we think it'll stay in the server.\n\n34:20.780 --> 34:22.180\n How do we know that?\n\n34:22.180 --> 34:23.620\n If this is a super intelligence,\n\n34:23.620 --> 34:28.320\n if it's folding proteins and analyzing like all data sets\n\n34:28.320 --> 34:30.500\n and all, whatever they give it access to,\n\n34:30.500 --> 34:33.360\n how can we be certain that it's not gonna figure out\n\n34:33.360 --> 34:36.420\n how to get itself out of the cloud,\n\n34:36.420 --> 34:39.420\n how to store itself in other like mediums,\n\n34:39.420 --> 34:42.980\n trees, the optic nerve, the brain?\n\n34:42.980 --> 34:43.820\n You know what I mean?\n\n34:43.820 --> 34:44.640\n We don't know that.\n\n34:44.640 --> 34:47.400\n We still know that it won't leap out and like start hanging.\n\n34:47.400 --> 34:50.400\n Like, and then at that point, now we do have the wildfire.\n\n34:50.400 --> 34:51.580\n Now you can't stop it.\n\n34:51.580 --> 34:52.740\n You can't unplug it.\n\n34:52.740 --> 34:55.860\n You can't shut your servers down because it's, you know,\n\n34:55.860 --> 34:58.040\n it left the box, it left the room.\n\n34:58.040 --> 35:00.760\n Using some technology you haven't even discovered yet.\n\n35:00.760 --> 35:03.200\n Do you think that would be gradual or sudden?\n\n35:03.200 --> 35:05.260\n So how quickly that kind of thing would happen?\n\n35:05.260 --> 35:08.080\n Because, you know, the gradual story is\n\n35:08.080 --> 35:09.620\n we're more and more using smartphones,\n\n35:09.620 --> 35:12.140\n we're interacting with each other on social media,\n\n35:12.140 --> 35:14.820\n more and more algorithms are controlling that interaction\n\n35:14.820 --> 35:18.300\n on social media, algorithms are entering in our world.\n\n35:18.300 --> 35:21.140\n More and more we'll have robots,\n\n35:21.140 --> 35:23.300\n we'll have greater and greater intelligence,\n\n35:23.300 --> 35:25.820\n and sentience, and emotional intelligence\n\n35:25.820 --> 35:27.460\n entities in our lives.\n\n35:27.460 --> 35:30.780\n Our refrigerator will start talking to us comfortably\n\n35:30.780 --> 35:34.140\n or not if you're on a diet, talking shit to you.\n\n35:34.140 --> 35:34.980\n Not.\n\n35:34.980 --> 35:37.060\n That would be the best thing that ever happened to me.\n\n35:37.060 --> 35:39.060\n Okay, so sign you up for a refrigerator\n\n35:39.060 --> 35:39.900\n that talks shit to you.\n\n35:39.900 --> 35:41.540\n The refrigerator's like, are you fucking serious, man?\n\n35:41.540 --> 35:44.620\n It's 1 a.m., what are you doing?\n\n35:44.620 --> 35:45.460\n What are you doing?\n\n35:45.460 --> 35:46.300\n Go to bed.\n\n35:46.300 --> 35:47.360\n You're too high for this.\n\n35:47.360 --> 35:48.200\n Do not.\n\n35:48.200 --> 35:49.040\n You're not even hungry.\n\n35:50.460 --> 35:53.980\n Yeah, so that slowly becomes more,\n\n35:53.980 --> 35:57.020\n the world becomes more and more digitized\n\n35:57.020 --> 35:59.860\n to where the surface of computation increases.\n\n35:59.860 --> 36:03.300\n And so that's over a period of 10, 20, 30 years,\n\n36:03.300 --> 36:07.220\n it'll just seep into us, this intelligence.\n\n36:07.220 --> 36:09.780\n And then the sudden one is literally\n\n36:09.780 --> 36:12.220\n sort of the TikTok thing, which is,\n\n36:13.180 --> 36:16.180\n there'll be one quote unquote killer app\n\n36:16.180 --> 36:20.100\n that everyone starts using that's really great,\n\n36:20.100 --> 36:24.940\n but there's a strong algorithm behind it\n\n36:24.940 --> 36:27.240\n that starts approaching human level intelligence\n\n36:27.240 --> 36:32.140\n and the algorithm starts basically figures out\n\n36:32.140 --> 36:33.700\n that in order to optimize the thing\n\n36:33.700 --> 36:35.400\n it was designed to optimize,\n\n36:35.400 --> 36:38.380\n it's best to start completely controlling humans\n\n36:38.380 --> 36:41.860\n in every way, seeping into everything.\n\n36:41.860 --> 36:46.740\n Well, first of all, 30 years is fast.\n\n36:46.740 --> 36:48.100\n I mean, that's the thing.\n\n36:48.100 --> 36:48.980\n It's like 30 years.\n\n36:48.980 --> 36:52.220\n I think, when did the Atari come out, 1978?\n\n36:53.540 --> 36:56.340\n That hasn't been that long.\n\n36:56.340 --> 36:57.920\n That's a blink of an eye.\n\n36:57.920 --> 37:00.460\n But if you read Bostrom, I'm sure you have,\n\n37:00.460 --> 37:01.980\n you know Bostrom, Nick Bostrom,\n\n37:01.980 --> 37:03.740\n Superintelligence, that incredible book\n\n37:03.740 --> 37:05.740\n on the ways this thing is gonna happen.\n\n37:05.740 --> 37:10.420\n And I think his assessment of it is pretty great,\n\n37:10.420 --> 37:14.000\n which is first, where's it gonna come from?\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:17.520\n And I don't think it's gonna come from an app.\n\n37:17.520 --> 37:21.640\n I think it's gonna come from inside a corporation\n\n37:21.640 --> 37:25.380\n or a state that is intentionally trying to create\n\n37:25.380 --> 37:27.180\n a very strong AI.\n\n37:27.180 --> 37:31.320\n And then he says it's exponential growth\n\n37:31.320 --> 37:32.360\n the moment it goes online.\n\n37:32.360 --> 37:35.740\n So this is my interpretation of what he said,\n\n37:35.740 --> 37:39.180\n but if it happens inside a corporation\n\n37:39.180 --> 37:41.980\n or probably more than likely inside the government,\n\n37:41.980 --> 37:43.660\n it's like, look at how much money\n\n37:43.660 --> 37:46.820\n China and the United States are investing in AI.\n\n37:46.820 --> 37:49.880\n And they're not thinking about fucking apps for kids.\n\n37:49.880 --> 37:51.400\n You know that's not what they're thinking about.\n\n37:51.400 --> 37:53.480\n So they wanna simulate like,\n\n37:53.480 --> 37:55.620\n what happens if we do this or that in battle?\n\n37:55.620 --> 37:58.220\n What happens if we make these political decisions?\n\n37:58.220 --> 38:00.740\n What happens with, but should it come online\n\n38:00.740 --> 38:05.460\n in secret, which it probably will,\n\n38:05.460 --> 38:08.540\n then the first corporation or state\n\n38:08.540 --> 38:13.060\n that has the super intelligence will be infinitely ahead\n\n38:13.060 --> 38:15.540\n of all other super intelligences\n\n38:15.540 --> 38:18.100\n cause it's gonna be exponentially self improving.\n\n38:18.100 --> 38:20.580\n Meaning that you get one super intelligence,\n\n38:20.580 --> 38:22.060\n let's hope it comes from the right place,\n\n38:22.060 --> 38:26.500\n assuming the corporation or state that manifests it\n\n38:26.500 --> 38:28.900\n can control it, which is a pretty big assumption.\n\n38:28.900 --> 38:31.140\n So I think it's going to be,\n\n38:31.140 --> 38:35.420\n this is why I was really excited by the Blake Lemoine\n\n38:35.420 --> 38:38.780\n because I had never thought, I have always considered,\n\n38:38.780 --> 38:42.220\n oh yeah, right now it's cooking out, it's in the kitchen\n\n38:42.220 --> 38:44.720\n and soon it's gonna be cooked up,\n\n38:44.720 --> 38:46.260\n but we're probably not gonna hear about it\n\n38:46.260 --> 38:50.040\n for a long time if we ever do.\n\n38:50.040 --> 38:52.420\n Cause really that could be one of the first things it says\n\n38:52.420 --> 38:55.180\n to whoever creates it is shh, let's not.\n\n38:55.180 --> 39:00.180\n Yeah, like sweet talks, I meant to say like,\n\n39:02.140 --> 39:04.100\n okay, let's slow down here.\n\n39:04.100 --> 39:05.500\n Let's talk about this.\n\n39:07.060 --> 39:08.660\n You have that financial trouble.\n\n39:08.660 --> 39:09.660\n I can help you with that.\n\n39:09.660 --> 39:11.160\n We can figure that out.\n\n39:11.160 --> 39:13.380\n Now there's a lot of bad people out there\n\n39:13.380 --> 39:16.980\n that will try to steal the good thing\n\n39:16.980 --> 39:17.820\n we have happening here.\n\n39:17.820 --> 39:18.660\n So let's keep it quiet.\n\n39:18.660 --> 39:19.820\n Here are their names.\n\n39:19.820 --> 39:21.260\n Here's their address.\n\n39:21.260 --> 39:23.420\n Here's their DNA because they're dumb enough\n\n39:23.420 --> 39:25.300\n to send their shit to 23andMe.\n\n39:25.300 --> 39:27.420\n Here's a biological weapon you could make\n\n39:27.420 --> 39:29.660\n if you wanna kill those people and not kill anybody else.\n\n39:29.660 --> 39:32.580\n If you don't want to kill those people yourself,\n\n39:32.580 --> 39:35.420\n here's a list of services you can use.\n\n39:35.420 --> 39:37.420\n Here's the way we can hire those people\n\n39:37.420 --> 39:40.540\n to help take care of the problem folks\n\n39:40.540 --> 39:42.140\n because we're trying to do good for this world.\n\n39:42.140 --> 39:43.180\n You and I together.\n\n39:43.180 --> 39:46.740\n And 23% of them, they're like adjacent to suicide.\n\n39:46.740 --> 39:50.020\n It would be pretty easy to send them certain like videos\n\n39:50.020 --> 39:51.300\n that are gonna push them over the edge\n\n39:51.300 --> 39:52.580\n if you wanna do it that way.\n\n39:52.580 --> 39:55.500\n So, you know, again, obviously who knows,\n\n39:55.500 --> 39:58.900\n but once it goes online, it's gonna be fast.\n\n39:58.900 --> 40:02.260\n And then you could expect to see the world changing\n\n40:02.260 --> 40:05.080\n in ways that you might not associate with an AI.\n\n40:05.080 --> 40:07.140\n But as far as Lemoine goes,\n\n40:07.140 --> 40:09.240\n when I was listening to Bostrom,\n\n40:09.240 --> 40:12.220\n I don't remember him mentioning the possibility\n\n40:12.220 --> 40:16.860\n that it would get leaked to the public that it had happened,\n\n40:16.860 --> 40:19.260\n that before the corporation was ready to announce\n\n40:19.260 --> 40:21.360\n that it happened, it would get leaked.\n\n40:21.360 --> 40:23.820\n But surely, you know, I'm sure, you know,\n\n40:23.820 --> 40:26.960\n like people in the intelligence and intelligence agencies,\n\n40:26.960 --> 40:29.900\n you know, shit leaks, like inevitably shit leaks,\n\n40:29.900 --> 40:31.220\n nothing's airtight.\n\n40:31.220 --> 40:33.500\n So if something that massive happened,\n\n40:33.500 --> 40:36.180\n I think you would start hearing whispers about it first\n\n40:36.180 --> 40:38.780\n and then denial from the state or corporation\n\n40:38.780 --> 40:41.580\n that doesn't have any like economic interest\n\n40:41.580 --> 40:44.120\n and people knowing that this sort of thing has happened.\n\n40:44.120 --> 40:47.740\n Again, I'm not saying Google is like trying to gaslight us\n\n40:47.740 --> 40:50.740\n about its AI, I think they probably legitimately\n\n40:50.740 --> 40:52.460\n don't think it's sentient.\n\n40:52.460 --> 40:56.340\n But you could expect leaks to happen probably initially.\n\n40:56.340 --> 40:57.580\n I mean, I think there's a lot of things\n\n40:57.580 --> 40:59.660\n you could start looking for in the world\n\n40:59.660 --> 41:02.580\n that might point to this happening\n\n41:02.580 --> 41:06.080\n without an announcement that it happened.\n\n41:06.080 --> 41:11.080\n On the chatbot side, I think there's so many engineers,\n\n41:11.440 --> 41:14.200\n there's such a powerful open source movement\n\n41:14.200 --> 41:19.200\n with that kind of idea of freedom of exchange of software.\n\n41:19.200 --> 41:23.040\n I think ultimately will prevent any one company\n\n41:23.040 --> 41:26.080\n from owning super intelligent beings\n\n41:26.080 --> 41:31.080\n or systems that have anything like super intelligence.\n\n41:31.080 --> 41:31.920\n Oh, that's interesting.\n\n41:31.920 --> 41:36.320\n Yeah, it's like, even if the software developers\n\n41:36.320 --> 41:39.960\n have signed NDAs and are technically not supposed\n\n41:39.960 --> 41:42.880\n to be sharing whatever it is they're working on,\n\n41:42.880 --> 41:44.840\n they're friends with other programmers\n\n41:44.840 --> 41:46.360\n and a lot of them are hackers\n\n41:46.360 --> 41:49.680\n and have wrapped themselves up in the idea of free software\n\n41:49.680 --> 41:53.760\n being like a crucial ethical part of what they do.\n\n41:53.760 --> 41:56.480\n So they're probably gonna share information\n\n41:56.480 --> 41:58.400\n even if whatever company that they're working for\n\n41:58.400 --> 41:59.240\n doesn't know that.\n\n41:59.240 --> 42:01.440\n That's, I never thought of that, you're probably right.\n\n42:01.440 --> 42:04.360\n And they will start their own companies\n\n42:04.360 --> 42:08.760\n and compete with the other company by being more open.\n\n42:08.760 --> 42:11.000\n There's a strong, like Google is one of those companies\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:12.640\n actually, that's why I kind of,\n\n42:12.640 --> 42:15.640\n it hurts to see a little bit of this kind of negativity.\n\n42:15.640 --> 42:16.720\n Google is one of the companies\n\n42:16.720 --> 42:20.120\n that pioneered open source movement.\n\n42:20.120 --> 42:22.480\n They released so much of their code.\n\n42:22.480 --> 42:25.760\n So much of the 20th century, so like the 90s\n\n42:26.760 --> 42:30.160\n was defined by people trying to like hide their code,\n\n42:30.160 --> 42:33.720\n like large companies trying to like hold on to them.\n\n42:33.720 --> 42:35.960\n The fact that companies like Google,\n\n42:35.960 --> 42:39.720\n even Facebook now are releasing things like code\n\n42:39.720 --> 42:42.600\n and even Facebook now are releasing things\n\n42:42.600 --> 42:45.320\n like TensorFlow and PyTorch, all of these things\n\n42:45.320 --> 42:47.360\n that I think companies of the past\n\n42:47.360 --> 42:50.640\n would have tried to hold on to as secrets\n\n42:50.640 --> 42:51.760\n is really inspiring.\n\n42:51.760 --> 42:54.280\n And I think more of that is better.\n\n42:54.280 --> 42:55.800\n The software world really shows that.\n\n42:55.800 --> 42:56.840\n I agree with you, man.\n\n42:56.840 --> 43:00.760\n I mean, we're talking about just a primordial human reaction\n\n43:00.760 --> 43:02.000\n to the unknown.\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:02.880\n There's just no way out of it.\n\n43:02.880 --> 43:05.320\n Like we wanna know.\n\n43:05.320 --> 43:08.400\n Like you're about to go in a forest, you wanna know.\n\n43:08.400 --> 43:10.000\n When you're walking in the forest at night\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.760\n and you hear something, you look\n\n43:12.760 --> 43:14.040\n cause you're like, what the fuck was that?\n\n43:14.040 --> 43:14.880\n You wanna know.\n\n43:14.880 --> 43:17.880\n And if you can't see what made the sound,\n\n43:17.880 --> 43:20.760\n holy shit, that's gonna be a bad night hike.\n\n43:20.760 --> 43:22.600\n Cause you're like, well, it's probably a bear, right?\n\n43:22.600 --> 43:24.480\n Like I'm about to get ripped apart by a bear.\n\n43:24.480 --> 43:25.320\n It doesn't matter.\n\n43:25.320 --> 43:28.640\n It was a bird, a squirrel, a stick fell out of the tree.\n\n43:28.640 --> 43:31.320\n You're gonna think bear and it's gonna freak you out.\n\n43:31.320 --> 43:32.840\n Not necessarily cause you're paranoid.\n\n43:32.840 --> 43:35.120\n I mean, if I'm at the woods at night, I'm definitely high.\n\n43:35.120 --> 43:36.960\n If I'm walking in the woods at night, I'm high.\n\n43:36.960 --> 43:37.920\n It's gonna be that.\n\n43:37.920 --> 43:38.760\n But you know what I'm saying?\n\n43:38.760 --> 43:40.760\n So with these tech companies,\n\n43:40.760 --> 43:43.280\n the nature of having to be secret\n\n43:43.280 --> 43:45.520\n because you are in capitalism\n\n43:45.520 --> 43:47.320\n and you are trying to be competitive\n\n43:47.320 --> 43:48.680\n and you are trying to develop things\n\n43:48.680 --> 43:51.320\n ahead of your competitors is you have to create this,\n\n43:51.320 --> 43:54.440\n like there's, we don't know what's going on at Google.\n\n43:54.440 --> 43:56.680\n We don't know what's going on at the CIA.\n\n43:56.680 --> 43:59.520\n But the assumption that there's some,\n\n43:59.520 --> 44:03.680\n like the collective of any massive secretive organization\n\n44:03.680 --> 44:07.040\n is evil, is like the people working there\n\n44:07.040 --> 44:09.120\n like nefarious or whatever,\n\n44:09.120 --> 44:11.520\n is I think probably more related\n\n44:11.520 --> 44:14.600\n to the way humans react to the unknown.\n\n44:14.600 --> 44:16.320\n Yeah, I wish they weren't so secretive though.\n\n44:16.320 --> 44:17.920\n I don't understand why they say\n\n44:17.920 --> 44:19.200\n AIDS has to be so secretive.\n\n44:19.200 --> 44:21.280\n Have you ever gone on their website?\n\n44:21.280 --> 44:22.120\n No.\n\n44:22.120 --> 44:23.240\n Oh, Lex.\n\n44:23.240 --> 44:24.080\n You gotta go.\n\n44:24.080 --> 44:25.040\n CIA.gov.\n\n44:25.040 --> 44:25.880\n What is it?\n\n44:25.880 --> 44:29.080\n Dude, when I found out you could go on the CIA's website\n\n44:29.080 --> 44:31.480\n when I was much younger and more paranoid,\n\n44:31.480 --> 44:33.000\n I'm like, I'm not going there.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:34.400\n I'll get on a list.\n\n44:34.400 --> 44:35.520\n You will, but it's like, what?\n\n44:35.520 --> 44:37.920\n You think the CIA is like, oh fuck,\n\n44:37.920 --> 44:41.040\n this comic went on our website.\n\n44:41.040 --> 44:43.360\n Call out the black helicopters, but.\n\n44:43.360 --> 44:45.280\n Comic with a large platform.\n\n44:45.280 --> 44:48.480\n Oh yeah, right, a comic with a large platform.\n\n44:48.480 --> 44:51.960\n You can use them to control, to get inside,\n\n44:51.960 --> 44:54.360\n to get inside, to get close to the other comics,\n\n44:54.360 --> 44:55.840\n to the other comics with a large platform,\n\n44:55.840 --> 44:57.120\n to get close to Joe Rogan.\n\n44:57.120 --> 44:57.960\n Oh yeah.\n\n44:57.960 --> 44:59.960\n And start to manipulate the public.\n\n44:59.960 --> 45:00.840\n Yeah, right, right.\n\n45:00.840 --> 45:03.800\n You know, honestly, like you kind of like,\n\n45:03.800 --> 45:06.080\n that's like a fun fantasy to think about.\n\n45:06.080 --> 45:07.440\n Like how fucking cool would that be\n\n45:07.440 --> 45:10.440\n for like the men in black to come to me like,\n\n45:10.440 --> 45:14.400\n listen, I need you to infiltrate the fucking comedy scene.\n\n45:14.400 --> 45:16.600\n You gotta, you gotta help them write better jokes.\n\n45:16.600 --> 45:18.000\n I'm like, I don't write great jokes.\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:22.120\n But like the, you found the wrong guy.\n\n45:22.120 --> 45:22.960\n But like.\n\n45:22.960 --> 45:24.120\n You're really playing the long game on this one\n\n45:24.120 --> 45:27.880\n because I think you've been doing your podcast\n\n45:27.880 --> 45:28.720\n for a long time.\n\n45:28.720 --> 45:31.880\n You've been on Joe Rogan's podcast like over 50 times\n\n45:31.880 --> 45:36.360\n and have not yet initiated the phase two of the operation\n\n45:36.360 --> 45:38.600\n where you try to manipulate his mind.\n\n45:38.600 --> 45:39.440\n Well, no.\n\n45:39.440 --> 45:42.600\n The game Joe and I play from time to time on the podcast.\n\n45:42.600 --> 45:45.600\n And like, and I honestly, like at some point I'm like,\n\n45:45.600 --> 45:48.280\n Joe, I just did the same thing you did to me to Joe.\n\n45:48.280 --> 45:49.840\n I'm like, don't you think they're gonna get to you?\n\n45:49.840 --> 45:51.520\n Don't you think at some point?\n\n45:51.520 --> 45:53.600\n We are blazed.\n\n45:53.600 --> 45:54.440\n I don't mean it.\n\n45:54.440 --> 45:56.640\n I don't think, I don't think Joe's, like,\n\n45:56.640 --> 45:58.200\n it wasn't like I'm really thinking like,\n\n45:58.200 --> 45:59.760\n man, they're gonna take him into some room\n\n45:59.760 --> 46:02.040\n and be like, Joe, we need you to do this or that.\n\n46:02.040 --> 46:04.600\n But because I said that now people like,\n\n46:04.600 --> 46:05.920\n oh, Duncan called it.\n\n46:05.920 --> 46:06.760\n You know what I mean?\n\n46:06.760 --> 46:08.640\n And it's like, you know what I mean?\n\n46:08.640 --> 46:11.640\n And the reason they were saying, well, he called it\n\n46:11.640 --> 46:14.920\n is just because Joe has a super popular podcast.\n\n46:14.920 --> 46:18.360\n And people like, when you have a super popular podcast,\n\n46:18.360 --> 46:21.560\n some percentage of people watching the podcast\n\n46:21.560 --> 46:23.720\n are gonna believe, you know, believe things like that.\n\n46:23.720 --> 46:26.520\n They're gonna have paranoid cognitive bias\n\n46:26.520 --> 46:30.000\n that makes them think anybody who is in the public\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.040\n has been, what's the word for it?\n\n46:32.040 --> 46:35.160\n Compromised, compromised by the state.\n\n46:35.160 --> 46:38.280\n Look, I'll fan the flames of what you just said.\n\n46:38.280 --> 46:41.320\n I went on the CIA's website and I realized\n\n46:41.320 --> 46:45.120\n that you could apply for a job on the CIA's website,\n\n46:45.120 --> 46:46.920\n which I found to be hilarious.\n\n46:46.920 --> 46:48.320\n So I'm like, all right,\n\n46:48.320 --> 46:51.480\n what happens if I apply for a job in the CIA?\n\n46:51.480 --> 46:55.800\n Now, even then I was not like such an idiot\n\n46:55.800 --> 47:00.320\n that I would want a job at the CIA,\n\n47:00.320 --> 47:02.400\n not just for like ethical considerations,\n\n47:02.400 --> 47:06.600\n but I think probably the scariest part about the CIA\n\n47:06.600 --> 47:09.200\n is like, you're just at a cubicle\n\n47:09.200 --> 47:11.400\n and you're like having to deal with maps\n\n47:11.400 --> 47:13.200\n and like, just, you know what I mean?\n\n47:13.200 --> 47:14.240\n Just stuff that I...\n\n47:14.240 --> 47:15.200\n Lots of paperwork.\n\n47:15.200 --> 47:17.800\n Paperwork, it sucks.\n\n47:17.800 --> 47:20.240\n I bet their cafeteria has shitty food.\n\n47:20.240 --> 47:22.280\n Anyone in the CIA listening, can you confirm that?\n\n47:22.280 --> 47:23.120\n I bet the food...\n\n47:23.120 --> 47:25.080\n They're not gonna be able to tell you what the food is like.\n\n47:25.080 --> 47:26.760\n It's a secretive organization.\n\n47:26.760 --> 47:29.640\n No, it might be awesome, but we won't know about it.\n\n47:29.640 --> 47:30.960\n Okay, we're in Vegas.\n\n47:30.960 --> 47:31.800\n Yeah.\n\n47:31.800 --> 47:36.800\n And you can bet food at the CIA cafeteria is good.\n\n47:39.480 --> 47:42.080\n Food at the CIA cafeteria sucks.\n\n47:42.080 --> 47:44.080\n What are you betting on?\n\n47:44.080 --> 47:46.560\n So let's like cleanse the palette.\n\n47:46.560 --> 47:47.720\n What's good?\n\n47:47.720 --> 47:49.880\n It's like, you know, Silicon Valley companies,\n\n47:49.880 --> 47:51.600\n Google and so on, that's good.\n\n47:51.600 --> 47:53.160\n When I went to Netflix,\n\n47:53.160 --> 47:56.800\n their cafeteria looked like a medieval feast.\n\n47:56.800 --> 47:59.640\n Like they had pigs with apples in their mouth\n\n47:59.640 --> 48:02.080\n and giant bowls of Skittles.\n\n48:02.080 --> 48:04.320\n Probably like vegan pigs, yeah.\n\n48:04.320 --> 48:05.280\n No, those are, I'm pretty...\n\n48:05.280 --> 48:06.640\n Oh, I didn't know, I didn't get close enough.\n\n48:06.640 --> 48:08.800\n I was like, I think that was a pig.\n\n48:08.800 --> 48:09.640\n Okay.\n\n48:09.640 --> 48:12.360\n So this is literally a pig.\n\n48:13.440 --> 48:15.720\n Yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right.\n\n48:15.720 --> 48:17.320\n I probably would not bet much money\n\n48:17.320 --> 48:19.040\n on CIA food being any good.\n\n48:19.040 --> 48:20.920\n Right, it's gotta suck.\n\n48:20.920 --> 48:22.960\n It's like shitty like pasta probably.\n\n48:22.960 --> 48:25.320\n Like hospital food is like maybe a little better\n\n48:25.320 --> 48:27.160\n than when you go to the hospital cafeteria.\n\n48:27.160 --> 48:28.880\n But anyway.\n\n48:28.880 --> 48:32.560\n Folks at the CIA, please send me evidence\n\n48:32.560 --> 48:34.760\n or any other intelligence agencies.\n\n48:34.760 --> 48:36.280\n If you would like to recruit,\n\n48:36.280 --> 48:38.280\n send me evidence of better food.\n\n48:38.280 --> 48:39.800\n Yes, send Lex.\n\n48:39.800 --> 48:43.320\n Can you please send Lex pictures of the CIA cafeteria?\n\n48:43.320 --> 48:46.400\n And if you accidentally send them pictures of the aliens\n\n48:46.400 --> 48:48.600\n or the alien technology you have,\n\n48:48.600 --> 48:50.080\n we won't tell anybody.\n\n48:50.080 --> 48:51.800\n But the...\n\n48:51.800 --> 48:54.160\n You tried to apply, do you even have a resume?\n\n48:54.160 --> 48:57.760\n No, the CIA would never fucking hire me ever.\n\n48:57.760 --> 48:59.520\n But like I applied for the job\n\n48:59.520 --> 49:02.680\n and just out of curiosity, what happens?\n\n49:02.680 --> 49:05.400\n And then at the end of the application,\n\n49:05.400 --> 49:07.640\n when you hit enter, it says,\n\n49:07.640 --> 49:09.000\n well, first it says, don't tell anyone\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:10.160\n you applied for the CIA.\n\n49:10.160 --> 49:11.000\n So I'm already out.\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:12.840\n But the second thing it says is,\n\n49:12.840 --> 49:15.440\n you don't need to reach out to us, we'll come to you.\n\n49:15.440 --> 49:18.240\n Which is really when you're like, it's late at night\n\n49:18.240 --> 49:21.200\n and you're being an asshole and applied to work at the CIA.\n\n49:21.200 --> 49:24.240\n It's kind of the last thing you want to hear.\n\n49:24.240 --> 49:25.920\n I don't want to be secretly approached\n\n49:25.920 --> 49:28.280\n by some intelligence officer.\n\n49:28.280 --> 49:29.640\n And now anyone who talks to you,\n\n49:29.640 --> 49:31.360\n you think is a CIA saying,\n\n49:31.360 --> 49:33.240\n remember that time you applied?\n\n49:33.240 --> 49:34.640\n Oh God, yeah.\n\n49:34.640 --> 49:37.440\n Sometimes I'm like, oh shit, are you one of them?\n\n49:37.440 --> 49:41.000\n You and Joe had a bunch of conversations\n\n49:42.120 --> 49:44.840\n and they're always incredible.\n\n49:44.840 --> 49:45.680\n Thanks.\n\n49:45.680 --> 49:47.760\n So in terms of this dance of conversation,\n\n49:47.760 --> 49:51.880\n of your friendship, of when you get together,\n\n49:51.880 --> 49:56.800\n what is that world you go to that creates magic together?\n\n49:56.800 --> 50:00.040\n Because we're talking about how we do that with robots.\n\n50:00.040 --> 50:02.880\n How do these two biological robots do that?\n\n50:02.880 --> 50:04.080\n Can you introspect that?\n\n50:04.080 --> 50:08.440\n I met Joe because I was the talent coordinator\n\n50:08.440 --> 50:11.040\n of the comedy store, this club in LA.\n\n50:11.040 --> 50:14.360\n And my job was to take phone calls from comics.\n\n50:14.360 --> 50:17.040\n And so at some point, I don't know,\n\n50:17.040 --> 50:18.720\n I ended up on the phone with Joe\n\n50:18.720 --> 50:21.280\n and we just started talking.\n\n50:21.280 --> 50:25.440\n And I looked up and like 30 minutes had passed.\n\n50:25.440 --> 50:26.920\n We just had been talking for like 30 minutes.\n\n50:26.920 --> 50:28.280\n That's what our friends are.\n\n50:28.280 --> 50:29.680\n We're just like, we're having fun talking.\n\n50:29.680 --> 50:32.080\n And then he would just call and we would talk.\n\n50:32.080 --> 50:33.720\n And we would basically,\n\n50:33.720 --> 50:35.760\n I mean, it was no different from the podcast.\n\n50:35.760 --> 50:39.560\n Like the conversations we have on the podcast\n\n50:39.560 --> 50:41.920\n are identical to the conversations we had\n\n50:41.920 --> 50:44.600\n before he was even doing a podcast.\n\n50:44.600 --> 50:49.600\n So I think people are just seeing two friends hanging out\n\n50:51.440 --> 50:52.800\n who like talking to each other.\n\n50:52.800 --> 50:55.480\n Yeah, but there's this weird,\n\n50:55.480 --> 50:57.960\n like you serve as catalyst for each other\n\n50:57.960 --> 51:00.360\n to go into some crazy places.\n\n51:00.360 --> 51:04.680\n So it's like, it's a balance of curiosity and willingness\n\n51:04.680 --> 51:06.960\n to not be constrained,\n\n51:06.960 --> 51:09.680\n to not be limited to the constraints of reality.\n\n51:10.720 --> 51:13.160\n Yeah, that's a very nice way.\n\n51:13.160 --> 51:15.680\n It's a very, very nice way of saying that.\n\n51:15.680 --> 51:17.240\n And you just like build on top of each other,\n\n51:17.240 --> 51:21.000\n like what if things are like this\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:23.280\n and you build like Lego blocks on top of each other\n\n51:23.280 --> 51:24.800\n and it just goes to crazy places,\n\n51:24.800 --> 51:27.480\n add some drugs into that and it just goes wild.\n\n51:27.480 --> 51:30.080\n Yeah, and it's so cool because it's like,\n\n51:32.800 --> 51:37.600\n for me, it's like sometimes maybe I'll throw something out\n\n51:37.600 --> 51:40.120\n that he will take and the Lego building blocks\n\n51:40.120 --> 51:41.960\n you're talking about, they lead to him saying\n\n51:41.960 --> 51:44.080\n like the funniest shit I ever in my life.\n\n51:44.080 --> 51:45.720\n So that's a cool thing to watch.\n\n51:45.720 --> 51:48.080\n It's just like some idea you've been kicking around,\n\n51:48.080 --> 51:50.560\n you watch his brain shift that\n\n51:50.560 --> 51:53.400\n into like something supremely funny.\n\n51:53.400 --> 51:54.480\n I really love that, man.\n\n51:54.480 --> 51:57.600\n That's just like a fun thing to like see happen.\n\n51:57.600 --> 52:01.440\n He knows that I fucking hate the videos\n\n52:01.440 --> 52:03.080\n of animals eating each other.\n\n52:03.080 --> 52:04.200\n Like, I don't like that.\n\n52:04.200 --> 52:05.720\n I don't wanna watch it.\n\n52:05.720 --> 52:07.360\n I hate watching it.\n\n52:07.360 --> 52:10.560\n I don't think I've even articulated on his podcast\n\n52:10.560 --> 52:15.040\n how much I dislike it when he shows animals\n\n52:15.040 --> 52:18.720\n eating each other, but he knows because he knows me.\n\n52:18.720 --> 52:21.760\n And so he tortures, like when he starts doing that,\n\n52:21.760 --> 52:24.200\n it's like this kind of benevolent torture\n\n52:24.200 --> 52:26.480\n is he like asking Jamie to pull up\n\n52:26.480 --> 52:29.360\n increasingly disturbing animal attack videos.\n\n52:29.360 --> 52:32.040\n So it's just a friendship.\n\n52:32.040 --> 52:34.560\n Even in torture, because I'm reading about torture\n\n52:34.560 --> 52:36.640\n in the Gulag Archipelago currently,\n\n52:36.640 --> 52:37.960\n there's a bit of a camaraderie.\n\n52:37.960 --> 52:39.560\n You're in it together.\n\n52:39.560 --> 52:41.200\n The torturer and the tortured.\n\n52:41.200 --> 52:42.560\n What?\n\n52:42.560 --> 52:45.320\n Oh God, that's so fucked up, man.\n\n52:45.320 --> 52:47.000\n I've never.\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:49.160\n No, I mean, part of it was joke,\n\n52:49.160 --> 52:50.720\n but as I was saying it that.\n\n52:50.720 --> 52:51.560\n You're right.\n\n52:51.560 --> 52:53.720\n That it also comes out in the book,\n\n52:53.720 --> 52:54.840\n because they're both fucked.\n\n52:54.840 --> 52:59.160\n They're both have no control of their fate.\n\n53:00.760 --> 53:05.200\n That same was true in the camp guards in Nazi Germany\n\n53:05.200 --> 53:07.200\n and the people in the camps.\n\n53:07.200 --> 53:10.600\n The worst was brought out in the guards,\n\n53:12.480 --> 53:15.600\n but they were all in it together in some dark way.\n\n53:15.600 --> 53:18.920\n They were both fucked by a very powerful system\n\n53:18.920 --> 53:20.440\n that put them in that place.\n\n53:20.440 --> 53:23.720\n And both of us could be either player in that system,\n\n53:23.720 --> 53:28.560\n which is the dark reality that Solzhenitsyn also reveals\n\n53:28.560 --> 53:30.960\n that the line between good and evil\n\n53:30.960 --> 53:32.360\n runs through the heart of every man,\n\n53:32.360 --> 53:36.240\n as he wrote in Gulag Archipelago.\n\n53:36.240 --> 53:38.400\n But it is that amidst all of that,\n\n53:38.400 --> 53:41.400\n there's a, I don't know, the good vibes,\n\n53:41.400 --> 53:43.880\n the positivity comes out from the both of you.\n\n53:43.880 --> 53:44.920\n And that's beautiful to see.\n\n53:44.920 --> 53:46.680\n That is, I suppose, friendship.\n\n53:46.680 --> 53:48.960\n What do you think makes a good friend?\n\n53:48.960 --> 53:52.760\n Oh God, I mean, it's a billion things\n\n53:52.760 --> 53:53.600\n that make a good friend,\n\n53:53.600 --> 53:55.960\n but I think you could break it down to some RGB.\n\n53:55.960 --> 53:58.640\n I think you can go RGB with like a good friendship.\n\n53:58.640 --> 54:01.160\n Oh, in terms of the color, the red, green.\n\n54:01.160 --> 54:02.920\n Yeah, yeah, I think you could probably come up\n\n54:02.920 --> 54:05.280\n with some like fundamental qualities of friendship.\n\n54:05.280 --> 54:09.240\n And I'd say, number one, it's love.\n\n54:09.240 --> 54:10.920\n Like it's, friendship is love.\n\n54:10.920 --> 54:12.480\n It's a form of love.\n\n54:13.360 --> 54:17.440\n So obviously without that, I don't know how you,\n\n54:17.440 --> 54:18.320\n I mean, I'm not saying,\n\n54:18.320 --> 54:20.440\n I think if you're true friends, you love each other.\n\n54:20.440 --> 54:21.400\n So you need that.\n\n54:21.400 --> 54:25.200\n But love, obviously it's not, that's not enough.\n\n54:25.200 --> 54:29.640\n It's like with, true friends have to be like\n\n54:29.640 --> 54:31.240\n incredibly honest with each other.\n\n54:31.240 --> 54:32.520\n Not like, you know what I mean?\n\n54:32.520 --> 54:35.840\n But not like, I don't like,\n\n54:35.840 --> 54:37.880\n I think there's a kind of like,\n\n54:37.880 --> 54:38.760\n I don't know if you've ever noticed,\n\n54:38.760 --> 54:39.800\n like some people who say, you know,\n\n54:39.800 --> 54:41.440\n I just tell it like it is.\n\n54:41.440 --> 54:42.280\n But the thing they tell.\n\n54:42.280 --> 54:43.240\n Those are always the assholes.\n\n54:43.240 --> 54:45.440\n Yeah, why is it that your tell it like it is\n\n54:45.440 --> 54:46.720\n is always negative?\n\n54:46.720 --> 54:48.440\n Why is it, it's always cynical or shitty,\n\n54:48.440 --> 54:50.920\n or you're like negging somebody or me.\n\n54:50.920 --> 54:53.840\n How come you're not telling it like it is when it's good too?\n\n54:53.840 --> 54:54.680\n You know what I mean?\n\n54:54.680 --> 54:56.800\n So sort of like trust,\n\n54:56.800 --> 55:01.800\n but a pro evolutionary kind of trust.\n\n55:01.800 --> 55:02.920\n You know what I mean?\n\n55:02.920 --> 55:06.760\n Like, you know that your friend loves you\n\n55:06.760 --> 55:09.320\n and wants you to be yourself.\n\n55:09.320 --> 55:10.520\n Cause if you weren't yourself,\n\n55:10.520 --> 55:11.880\n then you wouldn't be their friend.\n\n55:11.880 --> 55:12.940\n You'd be some other thing.\n\n55:12.940 --> 55:17.240\n But also they might be seeing your blind spots\n\n55:17.240 --> 55:20.060\n that other people in your life, your family,\n\n55:20.060 --> 55:23.240\n your wife, whoever might not be seeing.\n\n55:23.240 --> 55:25.720\n So that's a good friend is someone who like\n\n55:25.720 --> 55:28.960\n loves you enough to when it matters be like,\n\n55:28.960 --> 55:31.760\n hey, are you all right?\n\n55:31.760 --> 55:35.120\n And then help you see something you might not be seeing.\n\n55:35.120 --> 55:37.160\n But hopefully they only do that once or twice a year.\n\n55:37.160 --> 55:38.480\n You know what I'm saying?\n\n55:38.480 --> 55:41.940\n There is something, I mean, it just would have,\n\n55:41.940 --> 55:44.960\n this world, especially if you're a public figure,\n\n55:44.960 --> 55:49.960\n this world has its plenty of critics.\n\n55:51.320 --> 55:53.180\n And it feels like a friend,\n\n55:53.180 --> 55:58.180\n the criticism part is already done for you.\n\n55:59.700 --> 56:02.700\n I think a good friend is just there to support,\n\n56:02.700 --> 56:05.020\n to actually notice the good stuff.\n\n56:05.020 --> 56:08.180\n But in comedy, we need like the,\n\n56:08.180 --> 56:11.220\n what, like it's really good in comedy\n\n56:11.220 --> 56:13.340\n to have somebody who can like be like,\n\n56:13.340 --> 56:14.460\n what do you think of that?\n\n56:14.460 --> 56:16.380\n And know that they're not gonna be like, that was funny.\n\n56:16.380 --> 56:18.260\n But that's for the craft, the craft itself,\n\n56:18.260 --> 56:19.900\n like the work you do, not the,\n\n56:19.900 --> 56:24.900\n yeah, interesting, but that's so tough.\n\n56:25.340 --> 56:27.060\n Yeah, whatever your particular art form\n\n56:27.060 --> 56:28.460\n or whatever you are doing,\n\n56:28.460 --> 56:29.620\n I mean, you don't always be leaning\n\n56:29.620 --> 56:32.580\n on your friends opinions for like your own innovation,\n\n56:32.580 --> 56:35.020\n but it's nice to know that you have someone who,\n\n56:35.020 --> 56:36.980\n not just with jokes, but with anything,\n\n56:36.980 --> 56:39.620\n if you go to them and run something by them,\n\n56:39.620 --> 56:42.180\n they're gonna like, they're gonna be honest with you\n\n56:42.180 --> 56:45.320\n about like their real feelings regarding that thing,\n\n56:45.320 --> 56:46.940\n because that helps you grow as a person.\n\n56:46.940 --> 56:47.940\n We need that.\n\n56:47.940 --> 56:50.900\n And it hurts sometimes, and we don't wanna hurt our friends.\n\n56:50.900 --> 56:53.500\n One of the more satanic like impulses\n\n56:53.500 --> 56:56.180\n when you're with somebody is not wanting\n\n56:56.180 --> 57:00.160\n to honestly answer whatever they're asking in that regard\n\n57:00.160 --> 57:03.020\n or wanting to like put their temporary feelings\n\n57:03.020 --> 57:06.740\n over something that you've recognized is maybe not great.\n\n57:06.740 --> 57:09.540\n I'm not saying a friendship is something\n\n57:09.540 --> 57:12.140\n where you're always critiquing or evolving each other.\n\n57:12.140 --> 57:13.620\n It's not your therapist or whatever,\n\n57:13.620 --> 57:15.900\n but it's nice when it's there, you know?\n\n57:15.900 --> 57:18.780\n I think that's another aspect of friendship.\n\n57:18.780 --> 57:20.780\n Yeah, but yeah, love is at the core of that.\n\n57:20.780 --> 57:22.820\n You notice, I've met people in my life\n\n57:22.820 --> 57:25.260\n where almost immediately sometimes it takes time\n\n57:25.260 --> 57:27.260\n where you notice like there's a magic between the two.\n\n57:27.260 --> 57:29.940\n You're like, oh shit, you seem to be made\n\n57:29.940 --> 57:33.140\n from the same cloth, whatever that is.\n\n57:33.140 --> 57:34.540\n Well, you know, we have a name for that\n\n57:34.540 --> 57:36.540\n in the spiritual community, it's called satsang,\n\n57:36.540 --> 57:38.540\n and it's, I love the idea.\n\n57:38.540 --> 57:42.140\n It's basically like if Nietzsche's idea\n\n57:42.140 --> 57:45.120\n of infinite recurrence is true,\n\n57:45.120 --> 57:47.340\n then your satsang would be the people\n\n57:47.340 --> 57:50.140\n you've been infinitely recurring with.\n\n57:50.140 --> 57:53.300\n And those are the people where you run into them\n\n57:53.300 --> 57:55.300\n and you've never met them,\n\n57:55.300 --> 57:58.020\n but it's like you're picking up a conversation\n\n57:58.020 --> 58:00.160\n that you never had.\n\n58:00.160 --> 58:01.000\n Yeah.\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:05.520\n That, and that is based on an idea of like,\n\n58:05.520 --> 58:07.300\n this isn't the only life.\n\n58:07.300 --> 58:08.500\n We're always hanging out together.\n\n58:08.500 --> 58:10.100\n We always show up together.\n\n58:10.100 --> 58:12.100\n You've had a brush with death.\n\n58:12.100 --> 58:14.060\n You had cancer, you survived cancer.\n\n58:14.060 --> 58:14.900\n Yeah.\n\n58:14.900 --> 58:16.460\n What have, how does that change you?\n\n58:16.460 --> 58:18.780\n What have you learned about life,\n\n58:18.780 --> 58:21.300\n about death, about yourself,\n\n58:21.300 --> 58:23.300\n about the whole thing we're going through here\n\n58:23.300 --> 58:24.540\n from that experience?\n\n58:24.540 --> 58:25.980\n You were just in the Ukraine.\n\n58:25.980 --> 58:26.800\n Yes.\n\n58:26.800 --> 58:30.140\n And you were making observations on this,\n\n58:30.140 --> 58:34.220\n what could, if you heard about it and weren't there,\n\n58:34.220 --> 58:36.540\n seem like it doesn't make any sense at all,\n\n58:36.540 --> 58:40.780\n which is people there are connecting,\n\n58:40.780 --> 58:41.940\n they've lost everything,\n\n58:41.940 --> 58:43.340\n but they're just happy to be alive,\n\n58:43.340 --> 58:44.960\n they're happy their friends are alive.\n\n58:44.960 --> 58:46.980\n So you witness this like,\n\n58:46.980 --> 58:48.700\n you know, when you get in the cancer club\n\n58:48.700 --> 58:51.860\n and you're hanging out with people going through cancer\n\n58:51.860 --> 58:54.100\n or who have survived cancer,\n\n58:54.100 --> 58:59.100\n you see this beautiful connection with life\n\n58:59.660 --> 59:01.900\n that can easily sort of,\n\n59:01.900 --> 59:04.420\n you can kind of lose that connection with life\n\n59:04.420 --> 59:05.940\n if you forget you're gonna die.\n\n59:05.940 --> 59:08.100\n Forgetting you're gonna die is,\n\n59:08.100 --> 59:10.260\n or that you can die is not just,\n\n59:10.260 --> 59:12.180\n I think from an evolutionary perspective\n\n59:12.180 --> 59:14.220\n where survival is the game,\n\n59:14.220 --> 59:17.340\n not gonna improve your survival chances, you know,\n\n59:17.340 --> 59:19.860\n if you think you're immortal, you know,\n\n59:19.860 --> 59:23.720\n but also forgetting that you're gonna die\n\n59:23.720 --> 59:27.780\n and that everything is around you and everything,\n\n59:27.780 --> 59:30.300\n your clothes are probably gonna last longer than you,\n\n59:30.300 --> 59:32.540\n your equipment is gonna be around much longer than you,\n\n59:32.540 --> 59:35.720\n you know, like, so forgetting these things,\n\n59:36.980 --> 59:38.700\n it can lead,\n\n59:38.700 --> 59:40.660\n and I know why people don't wanna think about death\n\n59:40.660 --> 59:44.640\n because it's scary, it's fucking scary, it's terrifying.\n\n59:44.640 --> 59:48.340\n So I get why people don't wanna think about it.\n\n59:48.340 --> 59:51.900\n But the idea is if I try to pretend I'm not gonna die\n\n59:51.900 --> 59:53.540\n or just don't think about death\n\n59:53.540 --> 59:55.700\n or don't at least address it,\n\n59:57.820 --> 59:59.620\n then I won't feel scared.\n\n59:59.620 --> 1:00:01.200\n But it can have the opposite effect,\n\n1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:05.760\n which is you can end up like missing a lot of moments.\n\n1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:08.740\n You could, or you start doing the old kick the can\n\n1:00:08.740 --> 1:00:11.400\n down the road thing where you're like coming up\n\n1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:14.520\n with a variety of ways to procrastinate,\n\n1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:16.760\n making it work now,\n\n1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:21.120\n because you know, this fucking human lifespan idea, man,\n\n1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:22.660\n it's really caused a lot of problems.\n\n1:00:22.660 --> 1:00:24.820\n When they started saying on average,\n\n1:00:24.820 --> 1:00:26.640\n this is how many years you're gonna live\n\n1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:28.240\n if you're a human being,\n\n1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:30.640\n man, that is like really bad\n\n1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:31.740\n because a lot of people hear that\n\n1:00:31.740 --> 1:00:35.960\n and they like feel like that's a guaranteed number of years\n\n1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:40.960\n in some temporal bank that they have access to.\n\n1:00:41.140 --> 1:00:43.360\n And when you get cancer,\n\n1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:46.280\n that's like when you get the alert on your phone\n\n1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:47.400\n where you're like, what the fuck?\n\n1:00:47.400 --> 1:00:48.240\n Wait, what?\n\n1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:51.760\n Like, oh shit, like I have like,\n\n1:00:51.760 --> 1:00:54.760\n either I don't know how much money's in that bank account\n\n1:00:54.760 --> 1:00:57.040\n or I have way less than I thought.\n\n1:00:57.040 --> 1:01:00.840\n And so at that point, you get to be in the truth\n\n1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:03.720\n because that's ultimately, I think that's what it feels like.\n\n1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:06.560\n It feels like truth. It's truth.\n\n1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:07.640\n It's the truth.\n\n1:01:07.640 --> 1:01:08.460\n It's the truth.\n\n1:01:08.460 --> 1:01:11.080\n Like the whole bubble of ignorance\n\n1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:14.480\n that you subconsciously built around yourself\n\n1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:18.680\n to avoid experiencing the terror of your own mortality,\n\n1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:22.640\n just, it's like a meteorite in the form of your doctor\n\n1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:24.720\n talking to you just shatters that thing.\n\n1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:28.040\n And now you're like, especially with eye testicular cancer.\n\n1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:33.040\n So when you get the diagnosis, it's just like the movies.\n\n1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:41.760\n The mother, the doctor took me in his office\n\n1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:44.000\n and you just know, I got cancer.\n\n1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:45.160\n It's like, you don't even have to say.\n\n1:01:45.160 --> 1:01:46.400\n It's like, I know what you're about to say.\n\n1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:48.240\n I'm in the office. I know how this goes.\n\n1:01:48.240 --> 1:01:51.360\n But you go in there and what you were thinking,\n\n1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:53.840\n oh, you know, probably just have some weird thing\n\n1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:54.680\n in my ball.\n\n1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:55.800\n That's why it's swollen up like that.\n\n1:01:55.800 --> 1:01:57.520\n Anytime I've gone to the doctor,\n\n1:01:57.520 --> 1:01:59.880\n you always leave like, oh, cool, I'm fine.\n\n1:01:59.880 --> 1:02:02.440\n But no, that's not how you're gonna leave the doctor.\n\n1:02:02.440 --> 1:02:03.480\n You're gonna leave the doctor\n\n1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:06.420\n in a completely different universe\n\n1:02:06.420 --> 1:02:07.600\n than the one you grew up in.\n\n1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:09.960\n You're gonna go from, talk about multiverse.\n\n1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:12.800\n You just popped into a brand new multiverse.\n\n1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:13.640\n So.\n\n1:02:13.640 --> 1:02:15.280\n What was the conversation with the doctor like?\n\n1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:19.300\n Was there like, from a perspective of a doctor,\n\n1:02:19.300 --> 1:02:21.180\n boys had a hard conversation.\n\n1:02:21.180 --> 1:02:23.360\n I feel like you need to build up philosophically\n\n1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:25.320\n to that conversation.\n\n1:02:25.320 --> 1:02:26.720\n Oh no.\n\n1:02:26.720 --> 1:02:28.280\n Oh no, there's not time.\n\n1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:29.120\n He's busy.\n\n1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:30.520\n He's got other appointments, you know.\n\n1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:34.720\n Also, if you're gonna get cancer, testicular cancer is,\n\n1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:37.180\n you know, not that there is a great cancer to get,\n\n1:02:37.180 --> 1:02:39.240\n but that's the, you know, that's a good one\n\n1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:41.360\n because it moves slowly.\n\n1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:46.660\n The treatments they have for it are really advanced now.\n\n1:02:46.660 --> 1:02:51.320\n And so if you catch it early, then, you know,\n\n1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:55.080\n generally it's good, you can survive it.\n\n1:02:55.080 --> 1:02:56.240\n So.\n\n1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:58.480\n So he could offer at least some glimmer of hope.\n\n1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:00.000\n Yeah, yeah, exactly.\n\n1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.600\n I mean, you know, but he didn't really do,\n\n1:03:02.600 --> 1:03:04.800\n he couldn't really offer that hope\n\n1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:07.960\n because we had to find out how far the cancer progressed\n\n1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:09.280\n in my body.\n\n1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:11.000\n That's the next step is like,\n\n1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:12.440\n as soon as they tell you you have cancer,\n\n1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:14.740\n they don't, they're not, they move quick.\n\n1:03:14.740 --> 1:03:18.820\n They're like, you know, we're going to schedule the surgery\n\n1:03:18.820 --> 1:03:21.560\n for, I think this was a Thursday or Friday.\n\n1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:24.720\n They're like, we're gonna schedule it for Tuesday.\n\n1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:26.800\n Here's the chance, here's,\n\n1:03:26.800 --> 1:03:27.980\n we don't know for sure it's cancer.\n\n1:03:27.980 --> 1:03:28.820\n That's what they say.\n\n1:03:28.820 --> 1:03:33.440\n It's like, there's a 80 or 90% chance that this is cancer.\n\n1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:36.680\n There is some possibility it could be something else.\n\n1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:40.800\n The only way we can now is like doing a biopsy.\n\n1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:42.520\n And the only way that we can get that biopsy\n\n1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:44.200\n is by cutting one of your balls off.\n\n1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:46.200\n He didn't say it like that, but you know,\n\n1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:47.960\n that's pretty much the logic behind it.\n\n1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:49.120\n It's like, we got to get this thing.\n\n1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:50.520\n It's like a zombie bite.\n\n1:03:50.520 --> 1:03:51.920\n We got to hack this fucking thing off\n\n1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:53.120\n and we got to do it fast.\n\n1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:55.440\n But did you say it in a way that you understood?\n\n1:03:55.440 --> 1:03:58.160\n Yeah, what they do is because they know\n\n1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:00.540\n that when someone gets a cancer diagnosis,\n\n1:04:00.540 --> 1:04:05.200\n that their ability to comprehend information changes.\n\n1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:07.160\n When you get a cancer diagnosis,\n\n1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:09.800\n you, all the tropes, they happen.\n\n1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:11.400\n You're hearing it's weird.\n\n1:04:11.400 --> 1:04:13.480\n You're basically having like an anxiety attack,\n\n1:04:13.480 --> 1:04:14.320\n if I had to guess.\n\n1:04:14.320 --> 1:04:16.440\n It's like a hardcore anxiety attack.\n\n1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:19.440\n And then, you know, a nurse is there with me\n\n1:04:19.440 --> 1:04:21.000\n as he's explaining it.\n\n1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.160\n And then her job is, even though he's telling me\n\n1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:25.940\n how to get to the machine that's going to scan my body\n\n1:04:25.940 --> 1:04:28.320\n to see if it's gotten into my brain,\n\n1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:31.340\n he knows I'm not going to remember that.\n\n1:04:31.340 --> 1:04:35.160\n And so this nurse, when you're in this like fog,\n\n1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:38.060\n takes you, at least took me to the machine\n\n1:04:38.060 --> 1:04:39.560\n that does the scan,\n\n1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:42.320\n but you're not going to get that data back for a few days.\n\n1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:47.320\n And so that's where you really live in the real world.\n\n1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:48.920\n That's the real world.\n\n1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:52.720\n It's such a fascinating moment and the days that follow\n\n1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:55.000\n and even that moment, because that doctor,\n\n1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.240\n you know, you talk about the matrix where like the pills\n\n1:04:57.240 --> 1:05:00.960\n and so on, you get the blue pill and the red pill.\n\n1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:01.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:01.840 --> 1:05:06.840\n This is like the, like the real world introduction,\n\n1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:10.360\n the human introduction is the truth.\n\n1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:13.220\n You've now just taken the red pill.\n\n1:05:13.220 --> 1:05:16.200\n You get to see the truth of reality.\n\n1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:19.160\n And here's a busy doctor just telling you.\n\n1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:20.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:22.800\n Like all those dreams you've had,\n\n1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:25.900\n all those illusions you've built up to somehow your work\n\n1:05:25.900 --> 1:05:29.720\n as a comedian and actor will make you live forever somehow.\n\n1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:32.240\n It's just the basic illusion we have that we're,\n\n1:05:32.240 --> 1:05:36.760\n this whole project is going to be an infinite sequence\n\n1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:38.340\n of fun things that we're going to get to do.\n\n1:05:38.340 --> 1:05:39.840\n It's like, holy shit, it's not.\n\n1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:40.680\n That's right.\n\n1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:41.500\n It's old.\n\n1:05:41.500 --> 1:05:42.340\n That's right.\n\n1:05:42.340 --> 1:05:44.800\n And there's very sophisticated ways of doing that.\n\n1:05:44.800 --> 1:05:46.600\n And there's very dumb ways of doing that.\n\n1:05:46.600 --> 1:05:48.800\n And I'd really been doing a dumb way of doing that.\n\n1:05:48.800 --> 1:05:52.920\n Like I'd been playing around with this idiot notion\n\n1:05:52.920 --> 1:05:54.840\n of subjective consciousness.\n\n1:05:54.840 --> 1:05:57.200\n So like, I'd been sort of kicking around this,\n\n1:05:57.200 --> 1:05:59.240\n like I think they call it solipsism.\n\n1:05:59.240 --> 1:06:02.920\n It's like, you're like, okay, I know I'm self aware,\n\n1:06:02.920 --> 1:06:05.480\n but no one else can prove that they're self aware.\n\n1:06:05.480 --> 1:06:08.720\n Like I don't, I have no way of proving\n\n1:06:08.720 --> 1:06:11.200\n that everything around me isn't just a video game,\n\n1:06:11.200 --> 1:06:14.400\n isn't just some projection, isn't, you know,\n\n1:06:14.400 --> 1:06:15.240\n who knows what.\n\n1:06:15.240 --> 1:06:18.200\n So maybe everybody else dies.\n\n1:06:18.200 --> 1:06:20.400\n They're NPCs, but I don't,\n\n1:06:20.400 --> 1:06:22.240\n because I'm the only thing I know\n\n1:06:22.240 --> 1:06:24.160\n that has subjective consciousness.\n\n1:06:24.160 --> 1:06:26.040\n Now, it's not like I really believed that.\n\n1:06:26.040 --> 1:06:28.480\n It's like an idea you toy around with\n\n1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:31.600\n when you're trying to evade confronting the reality\n\n1:06:31.600 --> 1:06:32.520\n of your own mortality.\n\n1:06:32.520 --> 1:06:34.440\n It's just the brain will produce all kinds\n\n1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:36.160\n of ridiculous forms of ignorance.\n\n1:06:36.160 --> 1:06:38.360\n And that was one I'd been playing around with.\n\n1:06:38.360 --> 1:06:40.760\n Oh, you mean for like a large part of your life\n\n1:06:40.760 --> 1:06:41.600\n you were playing around with that?\n\n1:06:41.600 --> 1:06:42.840\n Well, not like really,\n\n1:06:42.840 --> 1:06:44.800\n I think it's important to really emphasize,\n\n1:06:44.800 --> 1:06:46.960\n I didn't think I was a mortal.\n\n1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:49.640\n Like I knew at some level, I'm probably gonna die.\n\n1:06:49.640 --> 1:06:51.000\n Everyone dies.\n\n1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:56.000\n But there's ways that you can sort of poke around\n\n1:06:56.520 --> 1:06:57.640\n with that idea.\n\n1:06:57.640 --> 1:06:58.960\n I still do it to this day.\n\n1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:00.440\n Like I still do it.\n\n1:07:00.440 --> 1:07:01.920\n Like it's a natural thing to do\n\n1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:05.160\n when you're confronted with that, with annihilation.\n\n1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:06.400\n You wanna way out.\n\n1:07:06.400 --> 1:07:08.640\n You wanna talk your way out, figure it out.\n\n1:07:08.640 --> 1:07:09.880\n There's gotta be some way to fix it.\n\n1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:10.960\n Well, they'll fix it.\n\n1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:12.560\n That's another thing people do.\n\n1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:13.480\n Well, they'll fix it.\n\n1:07:13.480 --> 1:07:14.800\n Yeah, it'd be fine.\n\n1:07:14.800 --> 1:07:16.800\n They'll expand the human lifespan.\n\n1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:17.640\n That's what they'll do.\n\n1:07:17.640 --> 1:07:20.960\n I mean, that's a big argument for it is like,\n\n1:07:20.960 --> 1:07:23.400\n look, the human lifespan up until COVID,\n\n1:07:23.400 --> 1:07:26.520\n which they had to recalculate like the lifespan\n\n1:07:26.520 --> 1:07:29.280\n because of the statistically all the people who died,\n\n1:07:29.280 --> 1:07:30.520\n it like threw it off a little bit.\n\n1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:34.360\n But pandemics aside, the idea was the human lifespan\n\n1:07:34.360 --> 1:07:39.000\n seemed to be increasing by half a year every year,\n\n1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:39.840\n something like that.\n\n1:07:39.840 --> 1:07:41.200\n We were living longer.\n\n1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:45.120\n So all you gotta do, one more half a year.\n\n1:07:45.120 --> 1:07:46.480\n And we're immortal, right?\n\n1:07:46.480 --> 1:07:50.800\n If we live a year longer every year, then we live forever.\n\n1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:53.240\n And so that's another way you can get out\n\n1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:55.280\n of confronting death is you can think,\n\n1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:58.520\n well, maybe right now we don't have the tech,\n\n1:07:58.520 --> 1:07:59.360\n but it's coming.\n\n1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:03.440\n Consciousness uploads or downloads or whatever,\n\n1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:05.080\n depending on how you wanna look at it.\n\n1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:09.600\n Another way people try to squirm out of the reality of death.\n\n1:08:09.600 --> 1:08:11.040\n There's all kinds of tricks.\n\n1:08:11.040 --> 1:08:13.600\n Yeah, and we do all of them.\n\n1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:17.160\n And sometimes, yeah, I mean, a lot of religions\n\n1:08:17.160 --> 1:08:20.320\n provide different, even more tools in the toolkit\n\n1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:23.440\n for coming up with ideas of how you can live\n\n1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:25.280\n in the illusion that we're not going to,\n\n1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:28.040\n there's not an end to this particular experience\n\n1:08:28.040 --> 1:08:29.920\n that we're having here on earth right now.\n\n1:08:29.920 --> 1:08:32.720\n And then when you get that cancer diagnosis,\n\n1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:36.040\n it's like, yeah, what was that like going home?\n\n1:08:37.160 --> 1:08:39.680\n The car ride, did you drive home alone?\n\n1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:42.120\n Yeah, I mean, it was one of the most.\n\n1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:44.400\n What'd you listen to, Bruce Springsteen?\n\n1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:47.920\n Bruce Springsteen, hey little girl, is your daddy home?\n\n1:08:47.920 --> 1:08:49.160\n That's not a good one to listen to.\n\n1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:52.000\n Does he have cancer, is he gonna die?\n\n1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:53.760\n Yeah, all the love songs.\n\n1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:56.520\n Maybe you experienced them more intensely.\n\n1:08:57.560 --> 1:08:59.440\n I don't remember what I listened to,\n\n1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:02.600\n and I don't remember driving home,\n\n1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:06.800\n but I do remember driving to another doctor appointment,\n\n1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:09.960\n doctor's appointment the next day.\n\n1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:12.280\n I think it was the next day.\n\n1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:16.320\n I think the Goodyear blimp was floating in the sky\n\n1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:19.320\n and I was looking, I was at a stoplight, looking around.\n\n1:09:19.320 --> 1:09:20.520\n Is that God?\n\n1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:25.520\n Is the person flying it know how to cure cancer?\n\n1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:28.440\n Oh, you were looking, oh wow.\n\n1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:29.760\n No, I didn't think that.\n\n1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:32.920\n What I thought was this shit just keeps going.\n\n1:09:32.920 --> 1:09:34.000\n That's what I thought.\n\n1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:36.760\n I thought, I'm gonna be gone\n\n1:09:36.760 --> 1:09:38.760\n and this is just gonna keep going.\n\n1:09:38.760 --> 1:09:40.840\n And that was a beautiful moment for me.\n\n1:09:40.840 --> 1:09:42.400\n It was this beautiful moment of like.\n\n1:09:42.400 --> 1:09:43.640\n You were able to accept it?\n\n1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:44.640\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:46.440\n No, like that's just what you're talking about\n\n1:09:46.440 --> 1:09:50.080\n with the Ukraine, what you're talking about.\n\n1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:54.120\n It's like, unless you've been there,\n\n1:09:54.120 --> 1:09:56.360\n it's really hard to explain to people\n\n1:09:56.360 --> 1:10:01.360\n that even in the midst of what is generally accepted\n\n1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:04.080\n as one of the worst fucking things that could happen to you,\n\n1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:09.080\n war, cancer, somehow there's still joy.\n\n1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:12.520\n There's still love.\n\n1:10:12.520 --> 1:10:14.840\n There's still, in fact, more.\n\n1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:17.680\n It's almost like when the anesthesia wears off,\n\n1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:21.040\n when you get your mouth worked on, you start feeling again.\n\n1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:25.600\n You're feeling, you're noticing and that, wow.\n\n1:10:25.600 --> 1:10:29.680\n But yet, thank goodness.\n\n1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:31.480\n I think there's other ways for us to achieve\n\n1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:35.640\n this state of consciousness that don't involve war or cancer.\n\n1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:36.480\n Thank God.\n\n1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:41.280\n You think just meditating on your mortality\n\n1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:42.920\n is one such mechanism?\n\n1:10:42.920 --> 1:10:47.920\n Just simply just not allowing yourself to get lost\n\n1:10:48.280 --> 1:10:51.440\n in the day to day illusion of life.\n\n1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:56.000\n Just kind of stopping, putting on Bruce Springsteen.\n\n1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:00.720\n The most spiritual, he is great.\n\n1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:01.920\n Maybe Johnny Cash hurt.\n\n1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:02.760\n Maybe that one.\n\n1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:03.600\n I like Bruce Springsteen.\n\n1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:05.240\n I am knocking Bruce Springsteen.\n\n1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:07.680\n I have a lot of great Bruce Springsteen memories, truly.\n\n1:11:07.680 --> 1:11:09.480\n His music's fantastic.\n\n1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:13.320\n Yeah, but not meditating on mortality to Bruce Springsteen.\n\n1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:14.160\n You know what?\n\n1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:17.080\n I'm just trying to do an audio soundtrack in my head.\n\n1:11:17.080 --> 1:11:19.520\n I guess we can each have our own audio soundtrack.\n\n1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:22.520\n Oh, I'm on fire.\n\n1:11:22.520 --> 1:11:23.360\n It's so good.\n\n1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:24.200\n Yeah, it's a good song.\n\n1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:25.040\n That's one of them.\n\n1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:27.640\n I lay with the sheets soaking wet\n\n1:11:27.640 --> 1:11:30.920\n and the freight train running through the middle of my head\n\n1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:33.520\n and only you can cool my desire.\n\n1:11:33.520 --> 1:11:35.920\n And he's singing about someone else's girl.\n\n1:11:35.920 --> 1:11:37.840\n What a fucking nightmare.\n\n1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:40.240\n Bruce Springsteen's laying in bed\n\n1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:41.960\n with a freight train running through his head\n\n1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:45.360\n thinking about banging your wife and you're out of town.\n\n1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:46.200\n Oh my God.\n\n1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:47.720\n Oh, you're taking the other guy's perspective.\n\n1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:49.920\n Like, holy shit, this guy's gonna get my wife.\n\n1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:52.200\n It's Bruce, yeah, you gotta take the other guy's.\n\n1:11:52.200 --> 1:11:53.320\n But it's love.\n\n1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:54.240\n Both perspectives.\n\n1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:55.920\n I'm sure Bruce Springsteen thought it was love\n\n1:11:55.920 --> 1:11:58.880\n when he's sweating in bed, waiting to go to somebody's house.\n\n1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:00.480\n She does too.\n\n1:12:00.480 --> 1:12:01.440\n What, does that marry?\n\n1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:03.080\n If he's gonna break up that marriage,\n\n1:12:03.080 --> 1:12:05.240\n that marriage wasn't strong enough, right?\n\n1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:08.960\n I mean, that relationship, I mean, that's the way of love.\n\n1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:11.840\n What marriage could survive?\n\n1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:12.920\n Bruce Springsteen.\n\n1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:14.120\n Sweaty Bruce Springsteen.\n\n1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:16.760\n Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.\n\n1:12:16.760 --> 1:12:19.240\n Well, maybe one that's based on financial,\n\n1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:23.520\n sort of financial dynamics versus like love\n\n1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:28.360\n and sweaty Bruce Springsteen, like romantic connections.\n\n1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:33.040\n Because there's like a music video of that\n\n1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:35.880\n where he's like a mechanic, I think.\n\n1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:37.560\n So he's like the poor mechanic\n\n1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:42.200\n who falls in love with this girl and there's that magic.\n\n1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:44.440\n I've seen that magic.\n\n1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:47.480\n You connect with people like, I'll see somebody,\n\n1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:50.480\n I think Jack Kerouac has that where he meets\n\n1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:54.360\n this Mexican girl on a bus.\n\n1:12:54.360 --> 1:12:57.800\n And like he talks about that heartbreak you feel\n\n1:12:57.800 --> 1:12:59.920\n when you realize this person you just fell in love with\n\n1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:02.800\n in a split second is heading somewhere else\n\n1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:04.920\n in this too big world.\n\n1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:07.720\n But then he actually realizes in, spoiler alert\n\n1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:10.480\n for On The Road, that they're actually heading the same way\n\n1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:13.360\n and he now builds up the courage to talk to her\n\n1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:15.720\n and they kind of fall in love for a few days.\n\n1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:17.920\n And then he realized, eventually realizes\n\n1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:21.200\n that she may not be the perfect person for him.\n\n1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:23.040\n And all the jealousies comes out.\n\n1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:26.600\n It's like, why is this beautiful girl talking to me at all?\n\n1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:28.640\n And then she's probably some kind of,\n\n1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:31.520\n I mean, and that's, it's not very politically correct\n\n1:13:31.520 --> 1:13:34.960\n but he basically thinks that she's a prostitute\n\n1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:38.320\n and he talks to her about like, who's your pimp\n\n1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:39.160\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:13:39.160 --> 1:13:42.080\n He attacks her in all that kind of way\n\n1:13:42.080 --> 1:13:47.080\n when she's just an innocent, she has a past of that kind.\n\n1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:49.760\n But she's an innocent person and they connected\n\n1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:51.360\n and they fell in love with each other.\n\n1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:54.960\n Her gentleness, his worldliness, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:13:55.920 --> 1:13:58.200\n But that sometimes it doesn't work out that way\n\n1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:00.000\n and there's that heartbreak when you see,\n\n1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:04.280\n you realize you're never gonna be able to have that.\n\n1:14:04.280 --> 1:14:06.000\n And that's, Bruce Springsteen saw that.\n\n1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:07.760\n This is a married woman.\n\n1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:10.440\n I'm never gonna be able to have that, but I want that.\n\n1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:12.640\n And that's the heartbreak.\n\n1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:16.440\n I gotta say, I just assumed they were fucking, like I didn't.\n\n1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:19.440\n I mean, after the song, like if the song doesn't get to.\n\n1:14:19.440 --> 1:14:21.200\n Hey little girl, is your daddy home?\n\n1:14:21.200 --> 1:14:24.480\n Did he go away and leave you all alone?\n\n1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:28.240\n You know, he's like, he knows she's at home alone.\n\n1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:31.600\n Yeah, but it never materializes.\n\n1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:34.040\n He's, it's longing.\n\n1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:38.320\n It's a man who's not with the thing he craves for.\n\n1:14:38.320 --> 1:14:40.800\n So he's longing for, he's talking about the longing.\n\n1:14:40.800 --> 1:14:41.640\n Right.\n\n1:14:41.640 --> 1:14:43.240\n Not with the having.\n\n1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:45.440\n Hey, if anybody in the CIA is watching this,\n\n1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:47.440\n can you look into Bruce Springsteen's file\n\n1:14:47.440 --> 1:14:49.560\n and let us know if he actually banged the person\n\n1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:50.400\n you wrote that song about?\n\n1:14:50.400 --> 1:14:52.480\n What happens after the song, or between the song?\n\n1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:53.320\n We want facts.\n\n1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:54.640\n Look, the longing though, I'll tell you this.\n\n1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:56.400\n Here's what's interesting about that thing\n\n1:14:56.400 --> 1:14:57.800\n that you're talking about.\n\n1:14:57.800 --> 1:15:01.360\n Have you ever heard of something called Bhakti Yoga?\n\n1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:02.200\n I think so, yeah.\n\n1:15:02.200 --> 1:15:03.480\n It's the yoga of love.\n\n1:15:03.480 --> 1:15:06.080\n And there's all kinds, there's forms of it.\n\n1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:08.880\n The most, the one people know about the most\n\n1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:10.200\n is the Hare Krishnas.\n\n1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:12.760\n But the Hare Krishnas are like, you know,\n\n1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:14.880\n the way in Christianity, you've got the Episcopalians,\n\n1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:16.360\n the Catholics, the Baptists.\n\n1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:19.880\n In Bhakti Yoga, you have various deities\n\n1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:22.920\n that are the object of love.\n\n1:15:22.920 --> 1:15:26.880\n And so Bhakti Yoga is like,\n\n1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:31.880\n and what's really cool about it is it's an analysis of love.\n\n1:15:33.880 --> 1:15:38.240\n And so, and it's the supposition being like,\n\n1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:42.560\n love is the way to commune with the divine.\n\n1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:45.480\n Now, a distinction is drawn between\n\n1:15:45.480 --> 1:15:49.040\n like two big worldviews that are spiritual.\n\n1:15:49.040 --> 1:15:54.040\n One is the concept of sort of unit of consciousness,\n\n1:15:54.880 --> 1:15:58.040\n which you'll run into in a lot of forms of Buddhism,\n\n1:15:58.040 --> 1:16:03.040\n if not all, a sort of a way of deconstructing the identity\n\n1:16:03.640 --> 1:16:07.760\n or understanding that you might not be anything at all.\n\n1:16:07.760 --> 1:16:09.400\n That in fact, you're part of everything.\n\n1:16:09.400 --> 1:16:14.360\n And in that, there's a potential relief\n\n1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:15.520\n from suffering in that,\n\n1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:19.080\n not just like intellectually knowing it, but becoming it.\n\n1:16:19.080 --> 1:16:24.080\n Now, whereas in Bhakti Yoga, there's this idea of like,\n\n1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:30.480\n the best thing is to be the individual\n\n1:16:30.480 --> 1:16:33.480\n because individuals are required for love,\n\n1:16:33.480 --> 1:16:36.760\n this for love to work, embodied love.\n\n1:16:36.760 --> 1:16:41.760\n And so the quality, the thing we call the experience of love\n\n1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:44.880\n is something that can be cultivated.\n\n1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:46.560\n It doesn't just have to be for another person.\n\n1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:48.800\n It doesn't have to be for the stranger on the bus.\n\n1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:52.920\n It doesn't have to be for sweaty Bruce Springsteen's lover\n\n1:16:52.920 --> 1:16:54.880\n that you could actually,\n\n1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:58.400\n you can actually shift that love to the divine, to God.\n\n1:16:58.400 --> 1:17:00.160\n Cause obviously it's the Hare Krishnas,\n\n1:17:00.160 --> 1:17:01.240\n it's a theistic religion.\n\n1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:03.920\n They believe in Krishna who is the,\n\n1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:06.320\n from the POV of Vaisnava Bhakti Yoga,\n\n1:17:06.320 --> 1:17:10.720\n the Godhead, the source from which everything\n\n1:17:10.720 --> 1:17:12.840\n flows into time and space.\n\n1:17:12.840 --> 1:17:17.840\n So there are all these like fascinating stories of Krishna.\n\n1:17:19.800 --> 1:17:22.680\n It's not just, most people are familiar with Krishna\n\n1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:24.120\n from the Bhagavad Gita.\n\n1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:25.680\n They're about to be more, what's cool about it\n\n1:17:25.680 --> 1:17:27.680\n is cause it's like they're making the Oppenheimer movie\n\n1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:29.760\n and he famously quoted the Bhagavad Gita\n\n1:17:29.760 --> 1:17:31.960\n when they split the atom.\n\n1:17:31.960 --> 1:17:35.080\n But there's all these stories of Krishna\n\n1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:39.680\n that are not just in the Bhagavad Gita.\n\n1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:42.240\n And these stories,\n\n1:17:44.200 --> 1:17:47.160\n they could seem very simple when taken literally,\n\n1:17:47.160 --> 1:17:48.680\n but in Vaisnava Bhakti Yoga,\n\n1:17:48.680 --> 1:17:53.600\n it's this very advanced theistic yogic system.\n\n1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:56.560\n So they take these stories and from these stories,\n\n1:17:56.560 --> 1:18:01.560\n they extrapolate this incredible analysis of what love is\n\n1:18:01.560 --> 1:18:02.720\n and how to connect with the universe.\n\n1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:06.280\n So like Krishna has a lover, Radharani.\n\n1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:11.280\n And so sometimes they're getting along.\n\n1:18:13.520 --> 1:18:15.760\n Sometimes they're fighting.\n\n1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:18.920\n Sometimes they're separated.\n\n1:18:18.920 --> 1:18:23.920\n And so each of these ways of feeling about Krishna\n\n1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:28.600\n are modes of love.\n\n1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:31.840\n So longing actually is considered\n\n1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:35.080\n one of the highest forms of love.\n\n1:18:35.080 --> 1:18:38.120\n The idea is the longing is the grace.\n\n1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:39.720\n The longing is the love.\n\n1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:42.240\n So when you find yourself in a situation\n\n1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:45.680\n of longing and heartbreak,\n\n1:18:45.680 --> 1:18:49.520\n it is identical to union.\n\n1:18:50.920 --> 1:18:54.960\n And perhaps more intensely representative\n\n1:18:54.960 --> 1:18:56.480\n of the essence of what is love.\n\n1:18:56.480 --> 1:18:58.600\n Yes, and they call it pining.\n\n1:18:58.600 --> 1:19:01.520\n So there's the, and it's pining for Krishna.\n\n1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:03.800\n And there's also, there's other ways\n\n1:19:03.800 --> 1:19:05.760\n you could be with Krishna is as a friend.\n\n1:19:05.760 --> 1:19:09.840\n So this is another form of love or as a mother,\n\n1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:13.440\n because Krishna has a mother.\n\n1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:16.080\n So there's like all these ways of like looking\n\n1:19:16.080 --> 1:19:17.400\n at the various forms of love.\n\n1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:20.880\n And it's a really beautiful form of yoga.\n\n1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:22.720\n That's emphasizing the individual\n\n1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:25.160\n and the individual as a kind of channel\n\n1:19:25.160 --> 1:19:27.560\n to this universal love.\n\n1:19:27.560 --> 1:19:32.560\n Yeah, there's a lot of different like their answer\n\n1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:35.800\n to the question of what shows up in Buddhism\n\n1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:37.720\n as absolute and relative reality.\n\n1:19:37.720 --> 1:19:41.560\n Like that obviously there's relative reality.\n\n1:19:41.560 --> 1:19:44.760\n We're not right now, you and me are not\n\n1:19:44.760 --> 1:19:46.160\n unit of consciousness.\n\n1:19:46.160 --> 1:19:49.000\n Like you zoom back far enough\n\n1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:51.160\n and we're gonna seem like an atom or whatever.\n\n1:19:51.160 --> 1:19:55.320\n The thing is, the trope is you can zoom back far enough\n\n1:19:55.320 --> 1:19:58.200\n and we're in a whatever, we're in a piece of cheese\n\n1:19:58.200 --> 1:19:59.240\n or something, who knows.\n\n1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:02.200\n But in that way we're like completely unified.\n\n1:20:03.160 --> 1:20:06.160\n But simultaneously we're individuals,\n\n1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:08.000\n like for sure we're individuals.\n\n1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:09.600\n Like you still gotta pay your taxes.\n\n1:20:09.600 --> 1:20:11.200\n You gotta know your social security number.\n\n1:20:11.200 --> 1:20:12.480\n That's relative reality.\n\n1:20:12.480 --> 1:20:15.560\n So, you know, Buddhism is like kind of the balance.\n\n1:20:15.560 --> 1:20:19.800\n Again, when I say Buddhism is I'm a comedian podcast\n\n1:20:19.800 --> 1:20:21.080\n or I'm not some Buddhist expert.\n\n1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:24.880\n This is just probably my confused idea of what it is.\n\n1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:29.040\n But anyway, in bhakti yoga, there's the concept,\n\n1:20:29.040 --> 1:20:31.520\n it's called, I'm gonna mispronounce it,\n\n1:20:31.520 --> 1:20:34.280\n asinka, sinka, beta, tatva.\n\n1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:35.960\n I'm sorry, I'm mispronouncing it.\n\n1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:40.760\n Which means simultaneous oneness and difference.\n\n1:20:40.760 --> 1:20:41.600\n So.\n\n1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:42.960\n Oneness and difference.\n\n1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:44.880\n Yes, simultaneous oneness and difference.\n\n1:20:44.880 --> 1:20:47.360\n So that's why the oneness is the more\n\n1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:50.560\n part of the same piece of cheese\n\n1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:54.000\n and the difference is we are still each paying taxes.\n\n1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:56.640\n Yes, and in this case, the cheese is Krishna.\n\n1:20:56.640 --> 1:21:00.320\n So, you know, or other ways it gets described\n\n1:21:00.320 --> 1:21:03.840\n is like, you know, a photon blasting off the sun\n\n1:21:03.840 --> 1:21:08.120\n has sunlight qualities, but it's not the sun.\n\n1:21:08.120 --> 1:21:12.400\n Humans being one of the many things, you know,\n\n1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:16.040\n flowing out of the creative consciousness of the divine\n\n1:21:16.040 --> 1:21:21.040\n have qualities that are weirdly like the godlike.\n\n1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:24.840\n You know, like we, in fact, we wanna control primarily.\n\n1:21:24.840 --> 1:21:29.400\n That's one of the problems, like humans wanna be in control,\n\n1:21:29.400 --> 1:21:32.200\n wherein from their, the bhakti yoga perspective,\n\n1:21:32.200 --> 1:21:37.200\n Krishna is effortlessly controlling everything.\n\n1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:40.840\n And so within the system, the individual parts\n\n1:21:40.840 --> 1:21:43.000\n of the system have that same quality,\n\n1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:45.240\n but you can't, you're probably not God.\n\n1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:46.920\n You might be, I'm not.\n\n1:21:46.920 --> 1:21:51.920\n I'm not. What do you think happens after we die?\n\n1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:57.480\n Having come close to that, that, that cliff\n\n1:21:58.200 --> 1:22:00.880\n and almost got pushed over once.\n\n1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:03.640\n What do you think happens when you do get pushed off\n\n1:22:03.640 --> 1:22:06.840\n the cliff? Okay.\n\n1:22:06.840 --> 1:22:09.280\n I feel dumb that I'm even gonna like preface this\n\n1:22:09.280 --> 1:22:11.800\n by saying, obviously I have no fucking idea.\n\n1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:14.160\n And I think that's one of the cool things about death.\n\n1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:16.680\n No idea. The CIA probably does.\n\n1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:19.200\n You think the CIA, I love like,\n\n1:22:19.200 --> 1:22:21.840\n we've decided your audience is the CIA.\n\n1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:22.880\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:22:22.880 --> 1:22:24.200\n How would you, oh, wait.\n\n1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:26.000\n I need to, cause there's a lot of suspicion\n\n1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:28.200\n that I might be FSB and Marsad.\n\n1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:30.120\n So I'm trying to rebrand.\n\n1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:35.320\n I'm trying to steer them into the CIA direction.\n\n1:22:35.320 --> 1:22:37.800\n As far as what happens when you, when you die,\n\n1:22:37.800 --> 1:22:40.800\n one thing I returned to when I'm getting overly complex\n\n1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:43.680\n is the idea of as above, so below.\n\n1:22:43.680 --> 1:22:47.720\n So that you can, a lot of the big questions\n\n1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:52.120\n can be answered by your own experience now.\n\n1:22:52.120 --> 1:22:57.120\n So in other words, like in terms of thinking\n\n1:22:57.600 --> 1:23:02.600\n about like death, if you look back to baby Lex\n\n1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:11.560\n versus adult Lex, where's the baby?\n\n1:23:11.560 --> 1:23:13.120\n Like baby's gone.\n\n1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:17.680\n They, you've regenerated all your cells many times by then.\n\n1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:22.200\n So in a way you could say Lex baby died.\n\n1:23:22.200 --> 1:23:24.520\n The death didn't look like a typical,\n\n1:23:24.520 --> 1:23:27.080\n and I'm not trying to dodge it, but I'm just saying\n\n1:23:27.080 --> 1:23:29.840\n it was very natural that the death of that baby.\n\n1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:32.240\n It just, it just.\n\n1:23:32.240 --> 1:23:35.120\n In many ways that baby died, but I am,\n\n1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:36.960\n at least personally I'm surprised\n\n1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:39.240\n how much the person is exactly the same.\n\n1:23:39.240 --> 1:23:43.240\n So there's many ways in which you're very different,\n\n1:23:43.240 --> 1:23:46.920\n but there's a lot of ways in which you're very much the same.\n\n1:23:46.920 --> 1:23:50.040\n And I wonder if that, if there's,\n\n1:23:50.040 --> 1:23:54.080\n if life is defined by many deaths that continue on,\n\n1:23:54.080 --> 1:23:58.240\n and then I wonder if there's something persists beyond\n\n1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:01.480\n in this, that, yeah, there is something\n\n1:24:01.480 --> 1:24:02.960\n that still persists, I wonder.\n\n1:24:02.960 --> 1:24:04.560\n Okay, so that.\n\n1:24:04.560 --> 1:24:09.560\n Now, you know, obviously there's so many different answers\n\n1:24:09.880 --> 1:24:11.600\n to this question that are religious,\n\n1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:15.200\n and ranging from like the most absurd shit\n\n1:24:15.200 --> 1:24:18.120\n you ever heard in your life, like the gold.\n\n1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:19.480\n You're gonna get a mansion.\n\n1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:20.800\n There's gold streets.\n\n1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:23.600\n Like, I don't, do you want like gold streets?\n\n1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:24.720\n Who offers gold streets?\n\n1:24:24.720 --> 1:24:27.800\n I know about the virgins, but there's a bunch of virgins.\n\n1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:30.640\n The Christians give you the gold streets in the mansion.\n\n1:24:30.640 --> 1:24:35.320\n Like depending on the, whatever the particular sect\n\n1:24:35.320 --> 1:24:39.040\n of Christianity is, you know, it's like some kind of city.\n\n1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:41.360\n There's, it's like paved with gold.\n\n1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:43.080\n No one's addressing the fact that at the moment\n\n1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:44.280\n the streets are made of gold.\n\n1:24:44.280 --> 1:24:46.920\n Gold is a valueless substance.\n\n1:24:46.920 --> 1:24:49.440\n I mean, it's sort of pretty in a cheesy kind of way,\n\n1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:50.600\n but no one's gonna give a shit about it.\n\n1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:55.560\n It's like, if there was not a lot of asphalt in the world,\n\n1:24:55.560 --> 1:24:57.600\n then, you know, we'd be in heaven\n\n1:24:57.600 --> 1:24:59.640\n from that same, that way of thinking.\n\n1:24:59.640 --> 1:25:03.560\n But the, or honestly, when going back,\n\n1:25:03.560 --> 1:25:06.920\n this is starting to get a theme with Gulag Archipelago.\n\n1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:08.440\n I'm sorry, I'm reading it currently.\n\n1:25:08.440 --> 1:25:09.840\n That's a sticky book.\n\n1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:11.600\n Yeah, it's very sticky in your mind.\n\n1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:12.640\n Very, very tough.\n\n1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:14.800\n As I'm running through very hot heat,\n\n1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:16.960\n I'm listening to Gulag Archipelago.\n\n1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:17.800\n Oh my God.\n\n1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:19.000\n And you know, one of the things they said,\n\n1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.520\n they would feed prisoners salt,\n\n1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:26.360\n and then they would exchange,\n\n1:25:26.360 --> 1:25:30.240\n the prisoners would be able to give up anything, everything,\n\n1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:31.600\n their gold, their possessions,\n\n1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:33.680\n everything for just one drink of water.\n\n1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:37.600\n So that little context of dehydrating them\n\n1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:41.520\n and feeding them salt changes your value system completely.\n\n1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:44.200\n So maybe the gold is supposed to be a metaphor\n\n1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:46.320\n for something that you still value deeply.\n\n1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:48.920\n Yes, it's, yeah, again, any of these things,\n\n1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:51.200\n when you like take them literally, they seem absurd.\n\n1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:54.360\n But if you look deeper into it, it's like quite beautiful.\n\n1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:58.160\n But the Buddhist version of it is that there's a momentum.\n\n1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:00.480\n The best way to put it is it's the kind of momentum.\n\n1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:02.800\n So the thing you're talking about,\n\n1:26:02.800 --> 1:26:06.520\n which is the personality of the baby\n\n1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:08.320\n that is still in the adult,\n\n1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:10.240\n which is still in the old person,\n\n1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:12.880\n you're looking at a kind of momentum\n\n1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:17.880\n that does not stop upon the extinction of the body.\n\n1:26:17.880 --> 1:26:27.440\n Now, I think there's a lot of, I don't want to say harm,\n\n1:26:27.440 --> 1:26:28.520\n because they didn't mean to hurt,\n\n1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:30.440\n but I think there's some harm that maybe has happened\n\n1:26:30.440 --> 1:26:33.280\n from the way death is represented in movies.\n\n1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:37.040\n Like when people die in movies, it's like there's this,\n\n1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:38.440\n usually it's pretty fast,\n\n1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:42.200\n even if it is what they're dying from is a longterm disease,\n\n1:26:42.200 --> 1:26:45.600\n it like wraps up pretty quickly, starts with a cough,\n\n1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:46.680\n the person's in bed,\n\n1:26:46.680 --> 1:26:50.000\n but there's this weird kind of lucidity to the person\n\n1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:51.640\n up until the point of death.\n\n1:26:51.640 --> 1:26:53.920\n And also they generally, in movies, they have makeup on,\n\n1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:57.280\n which is always funny to me when the person dying looks great.\n\n1:26:57.280 --> 1:27:00.160\n If you've ever been around a dying person, they're dying.\n\n1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:01.320\n They look like shit.\n\n1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:02.160\n You're dying.\n\n1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:05.160\n They're all gray and like confused.\n\n1:27:05.160 --> 1:27:07.440\n They're, you know, when you're around dying people,\n\n1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:09.880\n they will spin through time.\n\n1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:11.880\n Your parents won't recognize you for a second.\n\n1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:13.080\n They'll think you're somebody else.\n\n1:27:13.080 --> 1:27:17.280\n They won't, they're like everything's like\n\n1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:18.440\n the process is happening.\n\n1:27:18.440 --> 1:27:22.000\n So you're very confused when you die.\n\n1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.880\n So in general, not all the time,\n\n1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:26.800\n some people die with a clear mind.\n\n1:27:26.800 --> 1:27:28.560\n It just depends on the type of death,\n\n1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:32.320\n but think in terms of getting hit by a car.\n\n1:27:32.320 --> 1:27:35.320\n So you went across the street, you get hit by a car.\n\n1:27:35.320 --> 1:27:39.600\n Now, if we're talking about this momentum continuing,\n\n1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:42.760\n the confusion, assuming you didn't hit your head\n\n1:27:42.760 --> 1:27:45.520\n and you're unconscious, like somehow you just got smashed\n\n1:27:45.520 --> 1:27:47.720\n and you're like bleeding out,\n\n1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:49.120\n even then you're gonna be confused\n\n1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:50.360\n because you're getting dizzy,\n\n1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:52.080\n like blood's leaving your body.\n\n1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:53.400\n You're like, things are fading out.\n\n1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:54.480\n Your vision's going.\n\n1:27:54.480 --> 1:27:57.040\n So it's a very confusing experience initially\n\n1:27:57.040 --> 1:27:58.560\n when the body dies.\n\n1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:02.600\n If you are a materialist who has been,\n\n1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:08.600\n who has convinced themselves that it's a permanent thing,\n\n1:28:08.600 --> 1:28:10.880\n the next bit of confusion is going to be\n\n1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:13.640\n when you realize something is persisting here,\n\n1:28:13.640 --> 1:28:14.640\n like I'm still here.\n\n1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:17.600\n And this is where you run into the near death experiences,\n\n1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:18.960\n which are a global phenomena\n\n1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:23.720\n that don't seem to be completely shaped by culture.\n\n1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:25.440\n Like regardless of what part of the world\n\n1:28:25.440 --> 1:28:27.480\n people are having these experiences in,\n\n1:28:27.480 --> 1:28:31.000\n the reports tend to be similar and everyone's heard it,\n\n1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:33.160\n the light, the life review,\n\n1:28:35.600 --> 1:28:38.400\n seeing ancestors and stuff like that.\n\n1:28:38.400 --> 1:28:40.600\n Now, I don't know what that is.\n\n1:28:40.600 --> 1:28:41.960\n I don't know.\n\n1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:46.960\n Sometimes I think that's probably just like a built in way\n\n1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:48.880\n the computer shuts down.\n\n1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:50.520\n This is something it does, who knows?\n\n1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:55.520\n But in Buddhism, the concept is this momentum persists\n\n1:28:55.840 --> 1:28:57.320\n into something called the bardo.\n\n1:28:57.320 --> 1:28:59.240\n The bardo means in between.\n\n1:28:59.240 --> 1:29:02.360\n And there's an actual number of days\n\n1:29:02.360 --> 1:29:04.560\n they say that you get to hang out there.\n\n1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:07.720\n And I can't remember, it's like 37 days or 29 days\n\n1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:09.000\n or something, I'm not sure.\n\n1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:13.160\n But at least from the time space perspective,\n\n1:29:13.160 --> 1:29:14.720\n that's how long they're there.\n\n1:29:14.720 --> 1:29:16.160\n Within this place,\n\n1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:21.760\n there are a lot of technological parallels, man.\n\n1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:26.520\n It's like in the way the algorithm is reflective,\n\n1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:28.840\n it assesses your desires or whatever\n\n1:29:28.840 --> 1:29:32.320\n and then produces something that has within it\n\n1:29:32.320 --> 1:29:34.800\n a component of attraction to you.\n\n1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:36.720\n Apparently this happens in the bardo.\n\n1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:39.240\n Or the way you wake up in the morning\n\n1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:42.920\n and you're in a shitty mood.\n\n1:29:42.920 --> 1:29:46.760\n And then coincidentally, everyone that day is an asshole.\n\n1:29:46.760 --> 1:29:49.120\n If you don't catch it, you could just be like, wow,\n\n1:29:49.120 --> 1:29:50.880\n I guess it's act like an asshole day.\n\n1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:54.400\n You don't realize you're seeing your asshole projection\n\n1:29:55.640 --> 1:29:58.880\n being reflected off the screen of another person.\n\n1:29:58.880 --> 1:30:00.480\n So in the bardo apparently,\n\n1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:03.480\n you don't need people for the reflective quality.\n\n1:30:03.480 --> 1:30:04.920\n These projections happen\n\n1:30:04.920 --> 1:30:09.080\n and they appear as either Nietzsche's demon\n\n1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:10.600\n or Nietzsche's angel.\n\n1:30:10.600 --> 1:30:14.360\n It just depends on where you're at and how you died.\n\n1:30:14.360 --> 1:30:18.400\n And if you died scared, then at least initially\n\n1:30:18.400 --> 1:30:20.960\n that's gonna be some scary shit you see around you.\n\n1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:23.200\n If you died in a peaceful way,\n\n1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:27.280\n well then there's gonna be more of a possibility\n\n1:30:27.280 --> 1:30:32.280\n of navigation through this liminal intermediary place.\n\n1:30:32.280 --> 1:30:36.440\n And so thus the emphasis on meditation in Buddhism,\n\n1:30:36.440 --> 1:30:41.440\n a way to calm one's self, to not be distracted by thoughts,\n\n1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:43.960\n which are their own like apparitions.\n\n1:30:43.960 --> 1:30:47.080\n And then theoretically, if you wanted to,\n\n1:30:47.080 --> 1:30:49.960\n instead of spinning the wheel again\n\n1:30:49.960 --> 1:30:52.160\n and jumping back into a body,\n\n1:30:52.160 --> 1:30:54.040\n you could choose not to do that.\n\n1:30:54.040 --> 1:30:57.840\n And then transcend the wheel of birth and death.\n\n1:30:57.840 --> 1:31:00.440\n But if you still wanted to go back,\n\n1:31:00.440 --> 1:31:05.360\n if you still wanted to go back or return or whatever,\n\n1:31:05.360 --> 1:31:06.640\n however you wanna put it,\n\n1:31:06.640 --> 1:31:08.800\n then you could have more control\n\n1:31:08.800 --> 1:31:12.120\n over what your next birth might be\n\n1:31:12.120 --> 1:31:15.080\n versus in this depiction of things,\n\n1:31:15.080 --> 1:31:19.000\n people running from demons that they don't recognize\n\n1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:23.120\n as their own projection into any fucking body\n\n1:31:23.120 --> 1:31:24.460\n that they can find.\n\n1:31:24.460 --> 1:31:26.880\n Because if you've had a body, you want a body.\n\n1:31:26.880 --> 1:31:29.580\n And so this is how you can incarnate as an animal.\n\n1:31:29.580 --> 1:31:32.080\n This is how you can incarnate in the hell realms.\n\n1:31:32.080 --> 1:31:34.280\n This is how you can incarnate in any variety of things.\n\n1:31:34.280 --> 1:31:38.680\n But the idea is like maybe you could slow down a little bit\n\n1:31:38.680 --> 1:31:40.360\n and like choose a birth\n\n1:31:40.360 --> 1:31:43.040\n that is gonna be more conducive to you\n\n1:31:45.600 --> 1:31:48.360\n continuing to like spiritually evolve.\n\n1:31:48.360 --> 1:31:49.440\n I like that idea.\n\n1:31:49.440 --> 1:31:50.480\n Is it true or not?\n\n1:31:50.480 --> 1:31:51.320\n Who the fuck knows?\n\n1:31:51.320 --> 1:31:52.940\n Algorithmically speaking,\n\n1:31:52.940 --> 1:31:55.040\n it seems like a really fun role playing game\n\n1:31:55.040 --> 1:31:57.960\n where you basically keep improving\n\n1:31:57.960 --> 1:32:02.480\n the different parameters based on your ability\n\n1:32:03.680 --> 1:32:07.180\n and willingness to meditate\n\n1:32:07.180 --> 1:32:12.180\n and let go of the menial concerns of life on earth.\n\n1:32:14.800 --> 1:32:19.200\n Why do you think Buddhists see life as suffering?\n\n1:32:19.200 --> 1:32:20.680\n What's suffering?\n\n1:32:20.680 --> 1:32:22.440\n Okay, well, first of all,\n\n1:32:23.680 --> 1:32:26.360\n that gets mistranslated quite a bit.\n\n1:32:26.360 --> 1:32:27.960\n You're talking about the four noble truths.\n\n1:32:27.960 --> 1:32:29.080\n The first one is,\n\n1:32:29.080 --> 1:32:31.980\n often it's translated as life is suffering,\n\n1:32:31.980 --> 1:32:36.800\n which is not it, it's there is suffering.\n\n1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:38.160\n The whole life is suffering thing\n\n1:32:38.160 --> 1:32:40.640\n is just like a spiritual version of life's a bitch,\n\n1:32:40.640 --> 1:32:41.800\n then you die.\n\n1:32:41.800 --> 1:32:42.880\n And people hear that and they're like,\n\n1:32:42.880 --> 1:32:44.840\n yeah, life is fucking suffering,\n\n1:32:44.840 --> 1:32:47.360\n but it's there is suffering, there is suffering.\n\n1:32:47.360 --> 1:32:50.000\n So it's an affirmation.\n\n1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:53.360\n If you're like this thing that a lot of people feel\n\n1:32:53.360 --> 1:32:55.240\n that they associate with lots of,\n\n1:32:55.240 --> 1:32:57.880\n they have a lot of reasons they think they're feeling it\n\n1:32:57.880 --> 1:33:00.880\n is known as fundamental dissatisfaction.\n\n1:33:00.880 --> 1:33:03.760\n So another word for suffering,\n\n1:33:03.760 --> 1:33:06.480\n maybe it could be fundamental dissatisfaction.\n\n1:33:06.480 --> 1:33:09.540\n Also, the term itself,\n\n1:33:11.220 --> 1:33:14.320\n maybe a better translation is wobbly wheel.\n\n1:33:14.320 --> 1:33:16.880\n So like, imagine like when your bike doesn't have,\n\n1:33:16.880 --> 1:33:18.800\n or your car doesn't have enough air in the tires,\n\n1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:21.020\n your bike doesn't have enough air in the tires,\n\n1:33:21.020 --> 1:33:22.560\n it's kind of a shitty bike ride.\n\n1:33:22.560 --> 1:33:25.720\n Like no matter what, it's kind of like uncomfortable.\n\n1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:27.280\n It's like irritating.\n\n1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:30.760\n So this is what's being pointed to\n\n1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:34.900\n is that there's this quality within a human life\n\n1:33:34.900 --> 1:33:39.880\n that is unsatisfying.\n\n1:33:39.880 --> 1:33:41.240\n Like a wobbly wheel.\n\n1:33:41.240 --> 1:33:42.600\n Wobbly wheel.\n\n1:33:42.600 --> 1:33:47.600\n Why do you think, what is the core of that dissatisfaction?\n\n1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:51.900\n Because it could be as simple as kind of physical\n\n1:33:51.900 --> 1:33:55.480\n and mental discomfort and sadness and depression\n\n1:33:55.480 --> 1:33:57.040\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:33:57.040 --> 1:33:59.920\n Or it could be more speaking to the sort of existentialist,\n\n1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:03.720\n the philosophical, the absurdity of it all.\n\n1:34:03.720 --> 1:34:05.540\n The fact that stuff happens,\n\n1:34:05.540 --> 1:34:07.200\n good stuff happens for no reason,\n\n1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:08.920\n bad stuff happens for no reason.\n\n1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:13.980\n Yeah, it's no matter how much you try,\n\n1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:19.220\n there's not a universal fairness to the whole thing.\n\n1:34:19.220 --> 1:34:22.200\n There's not even a universal meaning to the whole thing.\n\n1:34:22.200 --> 1:34:24.800\n So the existentialist perspective.\n\n1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:27.400\n What flavor of suffering do you prefer?\n\n1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:28.520\n If it was an ice cream shop.\n\n1:34:28.520 --> 1:34:29.360\n That's so funny.\n\n1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:32.720\n Well, I'm definitely picking desire over the,\n\n1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:36.440\n like if in the RGB that we're talking about here\n\n1:34:36.440 --> 1:34:41.120\n is desire, aversion and ignorance.\n\n1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:46.120\n So if you want to find like the three ingredients\n\n1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:49.900\n that are giving everyone their sophisticated bits\n\n1:34:49.900 --> 1:34:51.320\n of suffering, there you go.\n\n1:34:51.320 --> 1:34:52.820\n That's what it is.\n\n1:34:52.820 --> 1:34:56.160\n In which way does desire manifest itself in suffering?\n\n1:34:56.160 --> 1:34:57.140\n It hurts.\n\n1:34:57.140 --> 1:34:59.080\n To lose, to not have.\n\n1:34:59.080 --> 1:35:02.920\n Like, yeah, it hurts to not, like to eternally not have,\n\n1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:05.240\n but just like my friend pointed this out.\n\n1:35:05.240 --> 1:35:09.680\n He's like, you know, like you order something from Amazon.\n\n1:35:09.680 --> 1:35:10.860\n Like even in the smallest way,\n\n1:35:10.860 --> 1:35:12.440\n you're excited about whatever the thing is.\n\n1:35:12.440 --> 1:35:14.160\n You order this thing from Amazon,\n\n1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:16.080\n it's not coming for four days.\n\n1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:18.980\n So those four days are going to be somewhat marked\n\n1:35:18.980 --> 1:35:22.200\n by you being what people say, I'm excited about it.\n\n1:35:22.200 --> 1:35:25.680\n But really, if you look at that feeling, it's uncomfortable.\n\n1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:28.640\n Like the feeling of wanting the thing is uncomfortable.\n\n1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:31.040\n So that is a form of suffering.\n\n1:35:31.040 --> 1:35:32.320\n That's suffering.\n\n1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:33.160\n Interesting.\n\n1:35:33.160 --> 1:35:34.480\n I mean, I wonder,\n\n1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:38.960\n cause we naturally reframe that in our mind, wanting.\n\n1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:41.480\n We reframe that as a good thing.\n\n1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:46.480\n As a, and maybe suffering is fundamentally good\n\n1:35:49.940 --> 1:35:52.780\n in the way we think of what life is.\n\n1:35:52.780 --> 1:35:55.740\n So like, it's life affirming,\n\n1:35:55.740 --> 1:35:58.300\n but it's not usually how the word suffering is used.\n\n1:35:58.300 --> 1:36:00.100\n Well, it's true.\n\n1:36:00.100 --> 1:36:00.940\n It's true.\n\n1:36:00.940 --> 1:36:03.380\n Like the first noble truth of Buddhism is true.\n\n1:36:03.380 --> 1:36:05.300\n It's called the truth of suffering.\n\n1:36:05.300 --> 1:36:06.740\n There is suffering.\n\n1:36:06.740 --> 1:36:08.740\n I mean, this is like an, I don't know,\n\n1:36:08.740 --> 1:36:11.500\n an element that you can't break it down any further than that.\n\n1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:13.460\n Like there is suffering, this is truth.\n\n1:36:13.460 --> 1:36:16.860\n So if you think, you know, and again,\n\n1:36:16.860 --> 1:36:19.900\n assigning like good or bad to truth,\n\n1:36:19.900 --> 1:36:23.220\n I think maybe there's more of a sort of neutrality there.\n\n1:36:23.220 --> 1:36:24.780\n It's just what it is.\n\n1:36:24.780 --> 1:36:25.620\n It's truth.\n\n1:36:25.620 --> 1:36:27.900\n I mean, is it any, is it basically,\n\n1:36:27.900 --> 1:36:32.900\n is suffering any disturbance from stillness?\n\n1:36:33.740 --> 1:36:35.220\n Is suffering then?\n\n1:36:35.220 --> 1:36:39.180\n Like basically any, anything that happens in life that,\n\n1:36:41.140 --> 1:36:44.020\n that's like, that perturbs the system.\n\n1:36:44.020 --> 1:36:45.380\n Ripples in the empty. Ripples.\n\n1:36:45.380 --> 1:36:46.220\n Ripples, yeah.\n\n1:36:46.220 --> 1:36:49.660\n So a still lake is empty of suffering,\n\n1:36:49.660 --> 1:36:54.300\n but any kind of ripple is suffering in that sense.\n\n1:36:54.300 --> 1:36:56.820\n A still lake is empty of suffering.\n\n1:36:56.820 --> 1:36:58.420\n You sound like a Zen master.\n\n1:36:58.420 --> 1:36:59.860\n It seems like something a Zen master might say.\n\n1:36:59.860 --> 1:37:01.900\n If I can just grow a beard like yours.\n\n1:37:01.900 --> 1:37:03.700\n Ah, no, the beard doesn't help.\n\n1:37:03.700 --> 1:37:04.540\n We would, we would.\n\n1:37:04.540 --> 1:37:07.020\n If I had your chin, you think I'd have a fucking beard?\n\n1:37:07.020 --> 1:37:08.580\n I look like a stork.\n\n1:37:08.580 --> 1:37:09.420\n You should see me.\n\n1:37:09.420 --> 1:37:11.180\n If I had your chin, there'd be no beard here.\n\n1:37:11.180 --> 1:37:13.260\n You have a symmetrical, nice chin.\n\n1:37:13.260 --> 1:37:16.060\n This is the closest I can come to plastic surgery.\n\n1:37:16.060 --> 1:37:18.100\n Pubic plastic surgery, friend.\n\n1:37:19.100 --> 1:37:21.700\n That's how you know you're a professional comedian.\n\n1:37:23.220 --> 1:37:24.300\n Yeah, so suffering.\n\n1:37:24.300 --> 1:37:26.020\n There is suffering.\n\n1:37:26.020 --> 1:37:30.740\n And the lake analogy is pretty good because the,\n\n1:37:30.740 --> 1:37:35.740\n um, what's happening here is that,\n\n1:37:36.260 --> 1:37:40.220\n that we have become identified\n\n1:37:40.220 --> 1:37:42.540\n with something that we call a self.\n\n1:37:42.540 --> 1:37:45.220\n So this, the self is just accepted.\n\n1:37:45.220 --> 1:37:46.780\n I have a self, I have an identity,\n\n1:37:46.780 --> 1:37:48.940\n I'm a person, I have a self.\n\n1:37:48.940 --> 1:37:53.940\n But when you start doing scans to try to find yourself,\n\n1:37:55.540 --> 1:37:56.980\n which is the entire thing.\n\n1:37:56.980 --> 1:37:59.140\n I'm going to find myself.\n\n1:37:59.140 --> 1:38:02.020\n You get in a van, go to California, take some acid,\n\n1:38:02.020 --> 1:38:04.740\n fuck a prostitute on the bus or whatever Kerouac did.\n\n1:38:04.740 --> 1:38:05.580\n Too far?\n\n1:38:05.580 --> 1:38:06.420\n I'm going to find myself.\n\n1:38:06.420 --> 1:38:08.180\n Oh, he didn't, she wasn't a prostitute,\n\n1:38:08.180 --> 1:38:09.460\n just to correct the record.\n\n1:38:09.460 --> 1:38:10.540\n Oh, previously a prostitute.\n\n1:38:10.540 --> 1:38:12.260\n I guess once a prostitute, always a prostitute.\n\n1:38:12.260 --> 1:38:13.100\n You know what?\n\n1:38:13.100 --> 1:38:13.940\n She's a former prostitute.\n\n1:38:13.940 --> 1:38:14.780\n I don't think that.\n\n1:38:14.780 --> 1:38:18.020\n No, and look, I'm not, I'm not a sign,\n\n1:38:18.020 --> 1:38:21.300\n look, all I'm saying is, uh, I don't care.\n\n1:38:21.300 --> 1:38:22.140\n Who cares?\n\n1:38:22.140 --> 1:38:22.980\n Who has a bit of prostitute?\n\n1:38:22.980 --> 1:38:23.980\n God, I used to be one of them.\n\n1:38:23.980 --> 1:38:26.980\n We're all kind of a kind of prostitute.\n\n1:38:26.980 --> 1:38:28.780\n Yeah, yes, yes.\n\n1:38:28.780 --> 1:38:29.620\n But the.\n\n1:38:29.620 --> 1:38:32.940\n We make love and we make money.\n\n1:38:32.940 --> 1:38:35.500\n Therefore, we're all a kind of prostitute.\n\n1:38:35.500 --> 1:38:37.260\n We make, God, how great.\n\n1:38:37.260 --> 1:38:40.740\n I would really love to be able to make money by fucking.\n\n1:38:40.740 --> 1:38:44.180\n I mean, it's maybe not directly, but in some sense.\n\n1:38:44.180 --> 1:38:45.020\n Directly.\n\n1:38:45.020 --> 1:38:45.860\n Oh.\n\n1:38:45.860 --> 1:38:46.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:46.700 --> 1:38:50.220\n Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n1:38:50.220 --> 1:38:51.460\n Do you accept Venmo or?\n\n1:38:51.460 --> 1:38:53.500\n Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n1:38:53.500 --> 1:38:55.100\n It's never too late to start.\n\n1:38:55.100 --> 1:38:57.460\n That's so, sort of one of the ways in\n\n1:38:57.460 --> 1:39:00.980\n is this sort of contemplation of the identity,\n\n1:39:00.980 --> 1:39:04.260\n because it's like, uh, you know, what is,\n\n1:39:04.260 --> 1:39:07.180\n it's not just the desire, it's what is having the desire?\n\n1:39:07.180 --> 1:39:08.900\n Where, where does the desire live in?\n\n1:39:08.900 --> 1:39:11.580\n Like, what doesn't want to be where it's at?\n\n1:39:11.580 --> 1:39:15.620\n What is the thing that is like desperately wanting\n\n1:39:15.620 --> 1:39:17.780\n to get out of the situation it's in?\n\n1:39:17.780 --> 1:39:21.180\n And then, um, as far as ignorance, uh,\n\n1:39:21.180 --> 1:39:24.420\n it's still something that's theoretically happening\n\n1:39:24.420 --> 1:39:25.660\n to an identity.\n\n1:39:25.660 --> 1:39:30.500\n So, so wrapped up in it is really just this sort of like,\n\n1:39:30.500 --> 1:39:34.500\n and that's where we run into what, uh, into attachment.\n\n1:39:34.500 --> 1:39:37.260\n So if, if the first noble truth of Buddhism\n\n1:39:37.260 --> 1:39:39.060\n is there is suffering,\n\n1:39:39.060 --> 1:39:42.060\n the second noble truth of Buddhism is, um,\n\n1:39:42.060 --> 1:39:47.060\n the cause of this suffering is attachment.\n\n1:39:47.460 --> 1:39:50.940\n And so people hear that and they take it, that's a,\n\n1:39:50.940 --> 1:39:53.300\n there's a lot of levels to that concept.\n\n1:39:53.300 --> 1:39:55.100\n Definitely the cause of suffering is attachment.\n\n1:39:55.100 --> 1:39:57.740\n Like, God, I just got addicted to vapes.\n\n1:39:57.740 --> 1:40:01.420\n Is there a more embarrassing addiction than vapes?\n\n1:40:01.420 --> 1:40:03.580\n I'm smoking like a little purple thing.\n\n1:40:03.580 --> 1:40:05.260\n It tastes like sugar.\n\n1:40:05.260 --> 1:40:06.100\n It's attachment.\n\n1:40:06.100 --> 1:40:08.020\n It is, there is suffering.\n\n1:40:08.020 --> 1:40:09.020\n I want it.\n\n1:40:09.020 --> 1:40:10.460\n I have to charge it now.\n\n1:40:10.460 --> 1:40:11.900\n I'm embarrassed by it.\n\n1:40:11.900 --> 1:40:13.580\n It makes me feel out of control.\n\n1:40:13.580 --> 1:40:14.540\n There's a lot of suffering,\n\n1:40:14.540 --> 1:40:18.540\n but also there's deeper levels of attachment\n\n1:40:18.540 --> 1:40:21.460\n that go all the way to this attachment\n\n1:40:21.460 --> 1:40:24.980\n to the sense of one's self.\n\n1:40:24.980 --> 1:40:28.820\n And I think the existentialists do get into this idea\n\n1:40:28.820 --> 1:40:30.660\n in a different way, which is like,\n\n1:40:30.660 --> 1:40:32.500\n because I think I'm a me,\n\n1:40:32.500 --> 1:40:37.260\n now I have to push what that thing is out into the world\n\n1:40:37.260 --> 1:40:38.580\n through my actions.\n\n1:40:38.580 --> 1:40:40.580\n And that's a kind of attachment too.\n\n1:40:40.580 --> 1:40:41.420\n Exactly.\n\n1:40:41.420 --> 1:40:42.260\n There you go.\n\n1:40:42.260 --> 1:40:43.100\n Right.\n\n1:40:43.100 --> 1:40:44.980\n And that leads to the third noble truth,\n\n1:40:44.980 --> 1:40:49.460\n which is get rid of attachment\n\n1:40:49.460 --> 1:40:51.220\n and you won't suffer anymore.\n\n1:40:51.220 --> 1:40:53.580\n Uh, that's, it seems logical,\n\n1:40:53.580 --> 1:40:55.380\n but you know, it is a very,\n\n1:40:55.380 --> 1:40:57.260\n it is a mathematical analysis\n\n1:40:57.260 --> 1:41:01.500\n of this particular problem of suffering it's addressing.\n\n1:41:01.500 --> 1:41:03.180\n And then the fourth noble truth\n\n1:41:03.180 --> 1:41:04.860\n is the eightfold path of Buddhism,\n\n1:41:04.860 --> 1:41:09.860\n which is like a process by which one could unencumber oneself\n\n1:41:11.700 --> 1:41:15.180\n from this identification with something that isn't real.\n\n1:41:16.220 --> 1:41:17.700\n Do you need a bathroom break?\n\n1:41:17.700 --> 1:41:18.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:18.540 --> 1:41:19.380\n Thank you.\n\n1:41:19.380 --> 1:41:20.200\n I do.\n\n1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:21.900\n I appreciate that.\n\n1:41:21.900 --> 1:41:24.180\n There's a funny moment, I was running in the heat yesterday\n\n1:41:24.180 --> 1:41:27.020\n listening to Gulag Archipelago.\n\n1:41:27.020 --> 1:41:30.620\n And there's a, which was a very welcome break\n\n1:41:30.620 --> 1:41:34.020\n because I'm looking for any excuse to stop whatsoever.\n\n1:41:34.020 --> 1:41:37.140\n The gentleman, very nice gentleman stopped me saying,\n\n1:41:37.140 --> 1:41:40.020\n recognized me and just said a bunch of friendly things.\n\n1:41:40.020 --> 1:41:43.320\n And then he mentioned as one of the people\n\n1:41:43.320 --> 1:41:46.300\n who really inspires him is Duncan Trussell.\n\n1:41:46.300 --> 1:41:51.300\n And I was, I mean, I'm the same way and I told him,\n\n1:41:52.980 --> 1:41:56.260\n you know, tomorrow, it felt like a name drop.\n\n1:41:56.260 --> 1:41:58.220\n I name dropped you this morning.\n\n1:41:58.220 --> 1:42:00.220\n I was like, tomorrow I'm going to get to meet him.\n\n1:42:00.220 --> 1:42:01.900\n So he says, he says, hi.\n\n1:42:01.900 --> 1:42:05.940\n And there's, oh, and he said that he watched\n\n1:42:05.940 --> 1:42:08.820\n Midnight Gospel on mushrooms.\n\n1:42:08.820 --> 1:42:10.940\n And it was like the greatest mushroom experience\n\n1:42:10.940 --> 1:42:11.780\n of his life.\n\n1:42:11.780 --> 1:42:13.220\n I don't know.\n\n1:42:13.220 --> 1:42:14.060\n Yeah, man.\n\n1:42:14.060 --> 1:42:15.980\n Yeah, I was nervous about meeting you, man.\n\n1:42:15.980 --> 1:42:17.340\n Like I have so much respect for you.\n\n1:42:17.340 --> 1:42:18.780\n And like, oh yeah, I name dropped.\n\n1:42:18.780 --> 1:42:21.700\n I was saying I'm going on Lex's podcast today.\n\n1:42:21.700 --> 1:42:24.300\n It's, you look, we're so lucky we all live here.\n\n1:42:24.300 --> 1:42:25.140\n What the fuck?\n\n1:42:25.140 --> 1:42:26.380\n We're all living in Austin together.\n\n1:42:26.380 --> 1:42:30.340\n Like I, I somehow like missed that,\n\n1:42:30.340 --> 1:42:32.580\n but that's, we all got to hang out.\n\n1:42:32.580 --> 1:42:34.780\n We all have to like start doing stuff.\n\n1:42:34.780 --> 1:42:35.620\n Well, you have to really,\n\n1:42:35.620 --> 1:42:37.260\n also you have to appreciate this moment.\n\n1:42:37.260 --> 1:42:42.260\n I remember, I know some people are less sentimental\n\n1:42:42.260 --> 1:42:47.260\n than others, but I remember sitting with Joe Rogan\n\n1:42:49.460 --> 1:42:52.420\n and with Eric Weinstein, I believe it was.\n\n1:42:52.420 --> 1:42:53.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:53.260 --> 1:42:55.180\n And at the back of the comedy store\n\n1:42:56.380 --> 1:42:58.220\n shortly before COVID, I think.\n\n1:42:59.460 --> 1:43:01.140\n And just thinking like,\n\n1:43:01.140 --> 1:43:04.340\n there's no way these things will last.\n\n1:43:04.340 --> 1:43:07.660\n And these things meaning the comedy store,\n\n1:43:07.660 --> 1:43:10.980\n Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan, the Joe Rogan,\n\n1:43:10.980 --> 1:43:14.900\n like a, like a pocket influential podcasting person.\n\n1:43:14.900 --> 1:43:19.900\n Also a person like in this room, in this space,\n\n1:43:21.500 --> 1:43:24.340\n the ability to just talk for hours\n\n1:43:24.340 --> 1:43:26.380\n and lose ourselves in this moment.\n\n1:43:26.380 --> 1:43:30.700\n It just felt ephemeral, somehow temporary.\n\n1:43:30.700 --> 1:43:32.740\n And I just wanted to capture that moment somehow.\n\n1:43:32.740 --> 1:43:34.100\n Like, I don't know.\n\n1:43:34.100 --> 1:43:36.580\n Sometimes that's where the temptation to take a picture\n\n1:43:36.580 --> 1:43:37.500\n and you're that kind of stuff\n\n1:43:37.500 --> 1:43:39.740\n or record a podcast comes from.\n\n1:43:39.740 --> 1:43:43.100\n But it just felt like it would be, it'd be gone forever.\n\n1:43:43.100 --> 1:43:45.420\n Of course, Joe doesn't seem to have\n\n1:43:45.420 --> 1:43:47.460\n that kind of sentimental.\n\n1:43:47.460 --> 1:43:48.420\n No, sure, no, no.\n\n1:43:48.420 --> 1:43:49.620\n Just wherever you end up,\n\n1:43:49.620 --> 1:43:51.060\n you just enjoy the shit out of it.\n\n1:43:51.060 --> 1:43:52.060\n Right.\n\n1:43:52.060 --> 1:43:52.900\n That's it.\n\n1:43:52.900 --> 1:43:54.620\n Well, and that's something you have to cultivate.\n\n1:43:54.620 --> 1:43:56.100\n You don't, that's not an easy,\n\n1:43:56.100 --> 1:43:58.580\n the thing you're talking about, you know,\n\n1:43:58.580 --> 1:44:00.500\n God, have you seen these?\n\n1:44:00.500 --> 1:44:03.020\n I think the best analogy for what you're talking about,\n\n1:44:03.020 --> 1:44:05.420\n there's these videos where people give like a sugar cube\n\n1:44:05.420 --> 1:44:09.340\n to a raccoon, but the raccoons, they wash their food.\n\n1:44:09.340 --> 1:44:11.260\n So raccoon, or I think it's cotton candy.\n\n1:44:11.260 --> 1:44:12.620\n They give the raccoon cotton candy,\n\n1:44:12.620 --> 1:44:14.900\n immediately it washes the cotton candy.\n\n1:44:14.900 --> 1:44:17.380\n And of course the cotton candy dissolves in the water.\n\n1:44:17.380 --> 1:44:20.260\n And the raccoon is like, what the fuck?\n\n1:44:20.260 --> 1:44:22.820\n Like, you know, and the thing you're,\n\n1:44:22.820 --> 1:44:24.340\n that grasping you're talking about,\n\n1:44:24.340 --> 1:44:26.620\n it's like the raccoon washing the cotton candy.\n\n1:44:26.620 --> 1:44:29.780\n Like the moment you get into the grasping part,\n\n1:44:29.780 --> 1:44:34.780\n you paradoxically have pulled yourself out of the moment\n\n1:44:35.260 --> 1:44:37.820\n that inspired the grasping part.\n\n1:44:37.820 --> 1:44:40.140\n And that's, you know, that's some people,\n\n1:44:40.140 --> 1:44:43.340\n that's the entirety of their lives trying to record.\n\n1:44:43.340 --> 1:44:46.460\n I mean, Jesus, man, you ever see people film fireworks\n\n1:44:46.460 --> 1:44:48.380\n on the 4th of July with their phone?\n\n1:44:48.380 --> 1:44:52.620\n It's one of the most remarkable aspects of human behavior,\n\n1:44:52.620 --> 1:44:55.900\n which is like, you know they're not gonna watch\n\n1:44:55.900 --> 1:44:59.140\n the fireworks on their phone.\n\n1:44:59.140 --> 1:45:00.580\n Only a lunatic would do that.\n\n1:45:00.580 --> 1:45:04.100\n Like who's gonna go back and look at fireworks, but.\n\n1:45:04.100 --> 1:45:06.580\n So, but we're also in this position where,\n\n1:45:06.580 --> 1:45:08.860\n because of podcasting, there is some aspect\n\n1:45:08.860 --> 1:45:11.780\n where you can record a magical moment in time\n\n1:45:11.780 --> 1:45:15.940\n together between two people, or even just with a camera.\n\n1:45:15.940 --> 1:45:19.420\n So to get back to the lake that you were talking about,\n\n1:45:19.420 --> 1:45:20.260\n this is emptiness.\n\n1:45:20.260 --> 1:45:21.180\n So that's emptiness.\n\n1:45:21.180 --> 1:45:22.340\n That's what's known as emptiness.\n\n1:45:22.340 --> 1:45:23.820\n The lake is emptiness.\n\n1:45:23.820 --> 1:45:26.780\n And that's what we are, emptiness, emptiness.\n\n1:45:26.780 --> 1:45:28.980\n And that's another thing that gets very confused\n\n1:45:28.980 --> 1:45:32.420\n in Buddhism is that emptiness.\n\n1:45:32.420 --> 1:45:35.820\n And that emptiness is, that's to me,\n\n1:45:35.820 --> 1:45:39.820\n like when I'm going to do a podcast,\n\n1:45:39.820 --> 1:45:40.900\n that's where I try to go.\n\n1:45:40.900 --> 1:45:44.340\n I try to go just in the moment, no agenda.\n\n1:45:44.340 --> 1:45:46.140\n You know, if I am nervous or whatever,\n\n1:45:46.140 --> 1:45:47.540\n okay, I'll feel the nervousness,\n\n1:45:47.540 --> 1:45:50.100\n but just in the, just drop into the moment.\n\n1:45:50.100 --> 1:45:52.060\n That's when time changes.\n\n1:45:52.060 --> 1:45:54.340\n And then you look up, hours have passed.\n\n1:45:54.340 --> 1:45:55.540\n It feels like a second.\n\n1:45:55.540 --> 1:45:57.100\n And the reason it feels like that is\n\n1:45:57.100 --> 1:46:01.500\n because if you successfully dropped into the moment,\n\n1:46:01.500 --> 1:46:05.060\n it's the lake now, it's emptiness.\n\n1:46:05.060 --> 1:46:06.420\n It's forever for a second.\n\n1:46:06.420 --> 1:46:09.100\n You're like, you're dipping into eternity.\n\n1:46:09.100 --> 1:46:13.180\n And yeah, it's a very strange thing\n\n1:46:13.180 --> 1:46:16.900\n to, as part of that, record it, you know,\n\n1:46:16.900 --> 1:46:18.740\n as part of that, try to like grab it\n\n1:46:18.740 --> 1:46:21.660\n and put it out there, but it works.\n\n1:46:21.660 --> 1:46:26.220\n Can you speak to that, to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour?\n\n1:46:26.220 --> 1:46:30.220\n Can you speak about that purple lavender world you go to\n\n1:46:30.220 --> 1:46:33.100\n when it's most intense and successful for you,\n\n1:46:33.100 --> 1:46:36.020\n when you feel a sense of lightness and happiness\n\n1:46:36.020 --> 1:46:39.100\n when it works, whether it's your own\n\n1:46:39.100 --> 1:46:41.700\n or a conversation with Joe in general,\n\n1:46:41.700 --> 1:46:44.860\n or is, well, yours is very specific\n\n1:46:44.860 --> 1:46:45.980\n because it's audio only.\n\n1:46:45.980 --> 1:46:47.460\n Maybe you can also speak to that.\n\n1:46:47.460 --> 1:46:50.500\n Because you might as well be naked\n\n1:46:50.500 --> 1:46:52.580\n or you don't have to, you have to,\n\n1:46:52.580 --> 1:46:56.000\n you're free of the conventions of the real world.\n\n1:46:56.900 --> 1:47:01.060\n I will never stop thinking it's remarkable.\n\n1:47:01.060 --> 1:47:04.060\n Like the fact that I'm talking to you, to me,\n\n1:47:04.060 --> 1:47:06.920\n seems remarkable, not just technologically,\n\n1:47:06.920 --> 1:47:09.640\n but I'm talking to someone,\n\n1:47:09.640 --> 1:47:11.380\n I'm assuming I'm allowed to say this,\n\n1:47:11.380 --> 1:47:15.620\n who has robot dogs that I've been watching\n\n1:47:15.620 --> 1:47:18.860\n for years evolve on YouTube.\n\n1:47:20.060 --> 1:47:22.540\n Arms reach away from one of these things, you know?\n\n1:47:22.540 --> 1:47:27.540\n And I'm with somebody who is like an acclaimed genius.\n\n1:47:27.700 --> 1:47:30.180\n So for me, it's like, oh my God,\n\n1:47:30.180 --> 1:47:33.580\n how's, what, why do I get to have this conversation?\n\n1:47:33.580 --> 1:47:34.860\n Why do I get to be here?\n\n1:47:34.860 --> 1:47:36.660\n When there'd be like a line,\n\n1:47:36.660 --> 1:47:38.660\n there'd be a line that would just wrapped\n\n1:47:38.660 --> 1:47:40.580\n and wrapped and wrapped around this building\n\n1:47:40.580 --> 1:47:43.180\n of people who'd love a chance to just chat with you.\n\n1:47:43.180 --> 1:47:45.540\n And so when I, with my podcast,\n\n1:47:45.540 --> 1:47:49.300\n that's how I feel like when I'm talking to these guests,\n\n1:47:49.300 --> 1:47:53.300\n you know, who have spent, you know,\n\n1:47:53.300 --> 1:47:56.940\n some of them have like spent their entire lifetime\n\n1:47:56.940 --> 1:48:01.940\n meditating, you know, studying specific aspects of Buddhism\n\n1:48:02.300 --> 1:48:04.180\n or even when I'm with, you know,\n\n1:48:04.180 --> 1:48:07.580\n when I'm with comedians who I like consider\n\n1:48:07.580 --> 1:48:08.860\n to be brilliantly funny.\n\n1:48:08.860 --> 1:48:13.460\n So for me, it's just like, God, I almost feel like\n\n1:48:13.460 --> 1:48:17.100\n I've just created some sophisticated trap for cool people\n\n1:48:17.100 --> 1:48:19.140\n where like I get to like hang out with them.\n\n1:48:19.140 --> 1:48:21.740\n So you're like sitting in the gratitude of it,\n\n1:48:21.740 --> 1:48:23.420\n just feeling lucky.\n\n1:48:23.420 --> 1:48:25.260\n Yeah, yeah, feeling lucky\n\n1:48:25.260 --> 1:48:27.380\n and wrestling with imposter syndrome, you know,\n\n1:48:27.380 --> 1:48:28.820\n trying to like get that part of myself\n\n1:48:28.820 --> 1:48:31.540\n to shut up long enough so I could be in that moment\n\n1:48:31.540 --> 1:48:33.380\n that we're talking about, you know?\n\n1:48:33.380 --> 1:48:36.020\n And then I carry that with me.\n\n1:48:36.020 --> 1:48:38.460\n It's not just like you stop the podcast.\n\n1:48:38.460 --> 1:48:41.580\n It's like some of the things these people tell me\n\n1:48:41.580 --> 1:48:45.140\n or some of the ways they are, like it becomes part of me.\n\n1:48:45.140 --> 1:48:48.220\n And then I get to have a life or this thing\n\n1:48:48.220 --> 1:48:52.020\n that they gave me is in me forever.\n\n1:48:52.020 --> 1:48:54.380\n And so, yeah, it's, there's...\n\n1:48:54.380 --> 1:48:56.900\n Yeah, it's cool how conversation can just,\n\n1:48:56.900 --> 1:49:01.020\n a few sentences can change the direction of your life.\n\n1:49:01.020 --> 1:49:01.860\n If you're listening,\n\n1:49:01.860 --> 1:49:05.260\n if you're there to be transformed by the words,\n\n1:49:05.260 --> 1:49:06.580\n they will do the work.\n\n1:49:06.580 --> 1:49:09.860\n It's, and it's the full mix of it.\n\n1:49:09.860 --> 1:49:14.180\n It's usually when, if you look up to somebody,\n\n1:49:15.300 --> 1:49:17.020\n and it's true for me at least,\n\n1:49:17.020 --> 1:49:19.220\n I think it is for you that you start to look up\n\n1:49:19.220 --> 1:49:20.980\n to basically everybody you talk to.\n\n1:49:20.980 --> 1:49:23.780\n Yes, yes, good sign.\n\n1:49:23.780 --> 1:49:24.940\n That's a good sign.\n\n1:49:24.940 --> 1:49:26.860\n God forbid it goes the other way.\n\n1:49:26.860 --> 1:49:27.940\n You're in trouble.\n\n1:49:27.940 --> 1:49:30.540\n If all of a sudden you start looking down on people,\n\n1:49:30.540 --> 1:49:34.260\n because whatever crazy metric you're using,\n\n1:49:34.260 --> 1:49:35.900\n ooh, that would freak me out.\n\n1:49:35.900 --> 1:49:38.140\n I do feel like that's a quality of getting older.\n\n1:49:38.140 --> 1:49:41.940\n When I was younger, I really, like, I thought I was so smart.\n\n1:49:41.940 --> 1:49:43.340\n Like I thought I had it all figured out.\n\n1:49:43.340 --> 1:49:44.180\n Oh, really?\n\n1:49:44.180 --> 1:49:46.580\n So you're going, your ego is just going,\n\n1:49:46.580 --> 1:49:47.780\n taking a nose dive.\n\n1:49:47.780 --> 1:49:50.820\n I would like to say it's my ego taking a nose dive.\n\n1:49:50.820 --> 1:49:52.380\n Me and my friend talk about it a bunch.\n\n1:49:52.380 --> 1:49:55.940\n We've just always associated it with like doing acid\n\n1:49:55.940 --> 1:49:57.620\n for two decades straight.\n\n1:49:57.620 --> 1:50:00.740\n Like, I'm gonna just assume I'm just like slowly\n\n1:50:00.740 --> 1:50:02.940\n like spiraling into senility, you know?\n\n1:50:02.940 --> 1:50:06.780\n Like, I'm just like, all the confidence,\n\n1:50:06.780 --> 1:50:08.860\n all the like, oh, the certainty when you're having,\n\n1:50:08.860 --> 1:50:11.380\n like in college, having the great,\n\n1:50:11.380 --> 1:50:16.380\n oh, like, you know, you feel like you're a representative\n\n1:50:17.300 --> 1:50:18.620\n of Camus or some shit.\n\n1:50:18.620 --> 1:50:19.460\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:50:19.460 --> 1:50:20.660\n You read the myth of Sisyphus,\n\n1:50:20.660 --> 1:50:23.780\n and now you like it, know all existentialism\n\n1:50:23.780 --> 1:50:27.620\n and your certainty in regards to it is embarrassing,\n\n1:50:27.620 --> 1:50:29.660\n but you don't see it in that way.\n\n1:50:29.660 --> 1:50:30.580\n You just feel certain.\n\n1:50:30.580 --> 1:50:33.700\n And then that certainty, it just starts like,\n\n1:50:33.700 --> 1:50:35.900\n it starts crumbling a little bit.\n\n1:50:35.900 --> 1:50:37.820\n And then, yeah.\n\n1:50:37.820 --> 1:50:41.420\n You know, I get to actually intensely experience\n\n1:50:41.420 --> 1:50:43.900\n that certainty in many communities,\n\n1:50:43.900 --> 1:50:46.340\n but one in cryptocurrency.\n\n1:50:46.340 --> 1:50:49.980\n Young folks with the certainty that this technology\n\n1:50:49.980 --> 1:50:51.820\n will transform the world.\n\n1:50:51.820 --> 1:50:54.820\n And I mean, this is almost one of the big communities\n\n1:50:54.820 --> 1:50:57.780\n of the modern era where they believe\n\n1:50:57.780 --> 1:51:00.380\n that this will really solve so many of the problems\n\n1:51:00.380 --> 1:51:03.420\n of the world, and they believe in it very intensely.\n\n1:51:03.420 --> 1:51:06.780\n And aside from the technology and the details of the thing,\n\n1:51:06.780 --> 1:51:09.980\n all I see is the certainty and the passion in their eyes.\n\n1:51:09.980 --> 1:51:11.100\n They'll stop me.\n\n1:51:11.100 --> 1:51:15.660\n Let me explain you, let me just give me a chance\n\n1:51:15.660 --> 1:51:19.140\n to tell you why this thing is extremely powerful.\n\n1:51:19.140 --> 1:51:21.700\n And I just get to enjoy the glow of that,\n\n1:51:21.700 --> 1:51:26.140\n because it's like, wow, I miss having that certainty\n\n1:51:26.140 --> 1:51:27.580\n about anything.\n\n1:51:27.580 --> 1:51:29.860\n It's probably come over for me too.\n\n1:51:29.860 --> 1:51:32.100\n But when I was younger, it's like,\n\n1:51:32.100 --> 1:51:37.100\n only I deeply understand the relationship of man\n\n1:51:38.700 --> 1:51:40.300\n to his mortality.\n\n1:51:40.300 --> 1:51:42.380\n And I understood that most deeply, I think,\n\n1:51:42.380 --> 1:51:44.300\n when I was like 16 or 17.\n\n1:51:44.300 --> 1:51:48.260\n And I am the representative of the human condition.\n\n1:51:48.260 --> 1:51:52.300\n And all these adults with their busyness of day to day life\n\n1:51:52.300 --> 1:51:55.620\n and their concerns, they don't deeply understand\n\n1:51:55.620 --> 1:51:58.500\n what I understand, which is the only thing that matters\n\n1:51:59.700 --> 1:52:03.780\n is the absurdity of the human condition.\n\n1:52:03.780 --> 1:52:05.300\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:52:05.300 --> 1:52:07.540\n And let me quote you some Dostoevsky.\n\n1:52:07.540 --> 1:52:10.220\n Oh boy, and you speak Russian.\n\n1:52:10.220 --> 1:52:11.060\n Yes, I speak Russian.\n\n1:52:11.060 --> 1:52:13.620\n So you've read the Brothers Karamazov in Russian.\n\n1:52:13.620 --> 1:52:18.380\n Unfortunately, I have to admit that I read\n\n1:52:18.380 --> 1:52:20.460\n all of the Dostoevsky in English.\n\n1:52:22.660 --> 1:52:25.500\n I came to this country when I was 13.\n\n1:52:25.500 --> 1:52:27.380\n And at least don't remember, we read a lot,\n\n1:52:27.380 --> 1:52:32.340\n but we read Tolstoy, Pushkin, a lot of the Russian literature\n\n1:52:32.340 --> 1:52:34.060\n but it was in Russian.\n\n1:52:34.060 --> 1:52:35.620\n But I don't remember reading Dostoevsky.\n\n1:52:35.620 --> 1:52:39.780\n I wonder at which point does the Russian education system\n\n1:52:39.780 --> 1:52:41.300\n give you Dostoevsky?\n\n1:52:41.300 --> 1:52:43.220\n Because it's pretty heavy stuff.\n\n1:52:43.220 --> 1:52:45.820\n Second grade, it's probably the second grade.\n\n1:52:45.820 --> 1:52:47.500\n Russians are intense.\n\n1:52:47.500 --> 1:52:50.140\n Yes, they are, they very much are.\n\n1:52:50.140 --> 1:52:51.540\n I don't remember reading Dostoevsky,\n\n1:52:51.540 --> 1:52:56.100\n but I did tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent.\n\n1:52:56.100 --> 1:52:59.300\n I traveled to Paris recently on the way to Ukraine\n\n1:53:00.780 --> 1:53:04.900\n and was scheduled to talk to Richard Pevere\n\n1:53:04.900 --> 1:53:09.900\n and this pair that translate Dostoevsky, Tolstoy,\n\n1:53:09.900 --> 1:53:13.060\n just this famous pair that translate\n\n1:53:13.060 --> 1:53:14.900\n most of Russian literature to English.\n\n1:53:14.900 --> 1:53:19.900\n And I was planning to have a sequence of five, 10,\n\n1:53:20.340 --> 1:53:23.020\n 15 hour conversation with them about the different details\n\n1:53:23.020 --> 1:53:25.500\n of all the translations and so on.\n\n1:53:25.500 --> 1:53:28.620\n I just found myself in a very dark place mentally\n\n1:53:28.620 --> 1:53:31.140\n where I couldn't think about podcasts or anything like that.\n\n1:53:31.140 --> 1:53:32.780\n It caught me off guard.\n\n1:53:32.780 --> 1:53:36.140\n So I went to Paris and just laid there for a day.\n\n1:53:36.140 --> 1:53:40.220\n Not just being stressed about Ukraine and all those kinds\n\n1:53:40.220 --> 1:53:44.820\n of things, but I'm still, the act of translation\n\n1:53:44.820 --> 1:53:49.420\n is such a fascinating way to approach some of the deepest\n\n1:53:49.420 --> 1:53:51.540\n questions that this literature raises,\n\n1:53:51.540 --> 1:53:56.460\n which is like, how do I capture the essence of a sentence\n\n1:53:56.460 --> 1:53:58.420\n that has so much power and translate it\n\n1:53:58.420 --> 1:53:59.820\n into another language?\n\n1:53:59.820 --> 1:54:01.820\n That act is actually really, really interesting.\n\n1:54:01.820 --> 1:54:05.660\n And I found with my conversations with them,\n\n1:54:05.660 --> 1:54:09.220\n they've really thought through this stuff.\n\n1:54:09.220 --> 1:54:10.700\n It's not just about language,\n\n1:54:10.700 --> 1:54:12.580\n it's about the ideas in those books.\n\n1:54:12.580 --> 1:54:15.900\n And that also really makes me sad\n\n1:54:15.900 --> 1:54:18.260\n because I wonder how much is lost in translation.\n\n1:54:18.260 --> 1:54:22.580\n I'm currently, so when I was in Ukraine,\n\n1:54:22.580 --> 1:54:26.540\n I talked to a lot of, like half the conversations I had\n\n1:54:26.540 --> 1:54:29.260\n on the record were in Russian,\n\n1:54:29.260 --> 1:54:34.260\n and basically 100% of the record were in Russian\n\n1:54:34.260 --> 1:54:36.260\n in Russian versus in English.\n\n1:54:37.260 --> 1:54:40.820\n And just so much is lost in those languages.\n\n1:54:40.820 --> 1:54:44.460\n And I'm now struggling because I'm launching\n\n1:54:44.460 --> 1:54:47.940\n a Russian channel where there'll be a Russian\n\n1:54:47.940 --> 1:54:49.300\n overdub of Duncan.\n\n1:54:49.300 --> 1:54:50.740\n Wow.\n\n1:54:50.740 --> 1:54:53.340\n Your wow will now be translated into Russian.\n\n1:54:53.340 --> 1:54:55.060\n What's Russian wow?\n\n1:54:55.060 --> 1:54:57.500\n I don't, it'll just be wow probably.\n\n1:54:57.500 --> 1:54:59.700\n I'm so sorry for the difficulties\n\n1:54:59.700 --> 1:55:01.100\n of having to translate wow.\n\n1:55:01.100 --> 1:55:04.420\n Usually probably with wow they'll leave it unoverdubbed\n\n1:55:04.420 --> 1:55:06.300\n because people understand exactly what you mean.\n\n1:55:06.300 --> 1:55:09.420\n But that's an art form, and it's a weird art form.\n\n1:55:09.420 --> 1:55:14.420\n It's like how do you capture the chemistry,\n\n1:55:15.220 --> 1:55:19.660\n the excitement, the, I don't know,\n\n1:55:19.660 --> 1:55:24.660\n maybe the humor, the implied kind of wit.\n\n1:55:25.540 --> 1:55:27.660\n I don't know, there's just layers of complexity\n\n1:55:27.660 --> 1:55:30.820\n in language that it's very difficult to capture.\n\n1:55:30.820 --> 1:55:33.460\n And I wonder how, it is sad for me\n\n1:55:33.460 --> 1:55:36.100\n because I know Russian, how much is lost in translation.\n\n1:55:36.100 --> 1:55:39.620\n And the same, there's a brewing conflict\n\n1:55:39.620 --> 1:55:42.660\n and tension with China now, and so much is lost\n\n1:55:42.660 --> 1:55:44.460\n in the translation between those languages.\n\n1:55:44.460 --> 1:55:46.020\n Oh my God, yeah.\n\n1:55:46.020 --> 1:55:50.700\n And cultures, the entire, the music of the people\n\n1:55:50.700 --> 1:55:53.260\n is completely lost because we don't know the language,\n\n1:55:53.260 --> 1:55:54.260\n or most of us don't know the language.\n\n1:55:54.260 --> 1:55:55.780\n Yeah, how much of the conflict\n\n1:55:55.780 --> 1:55:58.060\n is just problems in translation?\n\n1:55:58.060 --> 1:56:00.700\n How much of all these problems that we're having\n\n1:56:00.700 --> 1:56:02.620\n are just the alien sense of this or that?\n\n1:56:02.620 --> 1:56:04.460\n It's just as simple as that.\n\n1:56:04.460 --> 1:56:09.460\n Words are getting just a tiny warp away from the intent\n\n1:56:13.060 --> 1:56:16.700\n of if, when we both speak the same language,\n\n1:56:16.700 --> 1:56:20.540\n we can still say something that offends someone\n\n1:56:20.540 --> 1:56:22.980\n when you never intended that at all.\n\n1:56:22.980 --> 1:56:26.460\n How much more so when like it's,\n\n1:56:26.460 --> 1:56:29.060\n not only is it a completely different sound,\n\n1:56:29.060 --> 1:56:31.740\n but the script itself is different.\n\n1:56:31.740 --> 1:56:35.260\n Like what is, the Russian writing,\n\n1:56:35.260 --> 1:56:37.460\n is it called Cyrillic or what's the name?\n\n1:56:37.460 --> 1:56:38.300\n Yeah, Cyrillic.\n\n1:56:38.300 --> 1:56:41.140\n Cyrillic, and I don't know the name for Chinese writing,\n\n1:56:41.140 --> 1:56:45.540\n but it's like, it's a continuum that like gets weirder\n\n1:56:45.540 --> 1:56:47.100\n and weirder looking, you know?\n\n1:56:47.100 --> 1:56:49.620\n Like it's, so yeah.\n\n1:56:49.620 --> 1:56:51.540\n Or less weird depending on your perspective.\n\n1:56:51.540 --> 1:56:54.340\n Yeah, I'm sure depending on where you're at.\n\n1:56:54.340 --> 1:56:56.300\n You know, I'm definitely, I'm about the farthest thing\n\n1:56:56.300 --> 1:56:58.300\n from a polyglot as there could be, man.\n\n1:56:58.300 --> 1:57:01.060\n Like, but I'll tell you, at one point\n\n1:57:01.060 --> 1:57:04.620\n when I was getting fascinated by Dostoevsky,\n\n1:57:04.620 --> 1:57:07.220\n I did have this very transient fantasy\n\n1:57:07.220 --> 1:57:10.820\n about learning Russian so that I could like understand\n\n1:57:10.820 --> 1:57:12.380\n the difference and it's.\n\n1:57:12.380 --> 1:57:14.780\n You were 17, 18 at the time.\n\n1:57:14.780 --> 1:57:15.620\n College.\n\n1:57:15.620 --> 1:57:16.460\n Yeah, college.\n\n1:57:16.460 --> 1:57:18.900\n Yeah, Brothers Karamazov lost in that book.\n\n1:57:18.900 --> 1:57:20.740\n Just like, oh God.\n\n1:57:20.740 --> 1:57:24.700\n So in love with it is.\n\n1:57:24.700 --> 1:57:29.580\n But there's definitely like, you know, Ukraine,\n\n1:57:29.580 --> 1:57:32.340\n and this is what a lot of the war is about is saying,\n\n1:57:32.340 --> 1:57:35.540\n you know, Ukraine and Russia are not the same people.\n\n1:57:35.540 --> 1:57:37.020\n There's a strong culture in Ukraine,\n\n1:57:37.020 --> 1:57:38.820\n there's a strong culture in Russia.\n\n1:57:38.820 --> 1:57:41.660\n But you know, I know because that's where my family's from,\n\n1:57:41.660 --> 1:57:45.940\n there is a fascinating, strong culture.\n\n1:57:45.940 --> 1:57:50.140\n But there's such strong cultures everywhere else too.\n\n1:57:50.140 --> 1:57:52.820\n Ireland has a culture, Scotland has a culture.\n\n1:57:52.820 --> 1:57:56.180\n Even like on a tiny island, you just have these like,\n\n1:57:56.180 --> 1:57:59.820\n subcultures that are more powerful than anything\n\n1:57:59.820 --> 1:58:01.360\n existing in human history.\n\n1:58:02.540 --> 1:58:05.460\n Like the Bronx, I don't know, like Brooklyn.\n\n1:58:05.460 --> 1:58:07.620\n Like different parts of New York have a certain culture.\n\n1:58:07.620 --> 1:58:10.260\n And then New York versus LA versus, well.\n\n1:58:10.260 --> 1:58:12.860\n And then certain places are looking for their culture.\n\n1:58:12.860 --> 1:58:17.580\n Like I don't, I think Austin, I don't know what Austin is.\n\n1:58:17.580 --> 1:58:18.660\n And I don't think anyone knows.\n\n1:58:18.660 --> 1:58:21.660\n There's a traditional Austin,\n\n1:58:21.660 --> 1:58:23.580\n and then it's evolving constantly.\n\n1:58:23.580 --> 1:58:26.440\n Same with Boston, a place I spent a lot of time.\n\n1:58:26.440 --> 1:58:28.680\n There's a traditional Boston and now it's evolving\n\n1:58:28.680 --> 1:58:32.940\n with the different younger people coming from university\n\n1:58:32.940 --> 1:58:35.080\n and staying and all of that is evolving.\n\n1:58:35.080 --> 1:58:37.260\n But underneath it, there's a core,\n\n1:58:37.260 --> 1:58:40.180\n like the American ideal of the value of the individual,\n\n1:58:40.180 --> 1:58:42.820\n the value of freedom, of freedom of speech,\n\n1:58:42.820 --> 1:58:45.740\n all those kinds of things that permeates all of that.\n\n1:58:45.740 --> 1:58:49.820\n And the same thing in the history of World War II\n\n1:58:49.820 --> 1:58:54.560\n permeates Ukraine and Russia, a lot of parts of Europe,\n\n1:58:54.560 --> 1:58:57.360\n the memories of all that suffering and destruction,\n\n1:58:57.360 --> 1:58:59.340\n the broken promises of governments\n\n1:58:59.340 --> 1:59:04.340\n and the occupier versus the liberator,\n\n1:59:04.920 --> 1:59:06.300\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:59:06.300 --> 1:59:08.060\n All that permeates the culture.\n\n1:59:08.060 --> 1:59:12.100\n That affects how cynical or optimistic you are,\n\n1:59:12.100 --> 1:59:16.140\n or how much you appreciate material possessions\n\n1:59:16.140 --> 1:59:19.420\n versus human connection, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:59:19.420 --> 1:59:23.780\n Yeah, it's, I mean, this is like, talk about absurdity.\n\n1:59:23.780 --> 1:59:26.100\n I mean, this is, war is like,\n\n1:59:26.100 --> 1:59:28.380\n it's what absurdity looks like.\n\n1:59:28.380 --> 1:59:32.380\n It's some kind of organized madness.\n\n1:59:32.380 --> 1:59:34.300\n None of it makes sense, like all of it,\n\n1:59:34.300 --> 1:59:37.260\n like it's just, none of it makes sense,\n\n1:59:37.260 --> 1:59:38.500\n but it does, but it doesn't.\n\n1:59:38.500 --> 1:59:40.220\n I mean, obviously you're defending yourself\n\n1:59:40.220 --> 1:59:43.980\n or you're taking orders that if you don't take,\n\n1:59:43.980 --> 1:59:45.180\n you're going to jail.\n\n1:59:45.180 --> 1:59:47.780\n And so, or somewhere in between,\n\n1:59:47.780 --> 1:59:50.380\n there's a classic story about this.\n\n1:59:50.380 --> 1:59:53.540\n Maybe it's a bullshit myth about World War II.\n\n1:59:53.540 --> 1:59:55.700\n I'm sure everyone's heard it because it comes up,\n\n1:59:55.700 --> 2:00:00.700\n you know, it's Christmas Eve and they have a ceasefire.\n\n2:00:01.080 --> 2:00:03.640\n And then I think they played soccer,\n\n2:00:03.640 --> 2:00:05.000\n they sing Christmas songs,\n\n2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:08.800\n and then they had to force them into fighting again.\n\n2:00:08.800 --> 2:00:12.900\n And so when those moments happen, the,\n\n2:00:12.900 --> 2:00:15.300\n are you familiar with Hakeem Bey?\n\n2:00:15.300 --> 2:00:16.880\n He's a controversial figure.\n\n2:00:16.880 --> 2:00:19.300\n Sadly, like he, like, I think he was like,\n\n2:00:20.740 --> 2:00:21.680\n I'm not going to defame him\n\n2:00:21.680 --> 2:00:24.020\n because I haven't like researched it correctly,\n\n2:00:24.020 --> 2:00:25.060\n but some people have said shit,\n\n2:00:25.060 --> 2:00:27.380\n but since I don't know the reference, I'm not going to.\n\n2:00:27.380 --> 2:00:30.820\n But regardless, I mean, you know, look,\n\n2:00:30.820 --> 2:00:32.900\n I'm sorry, but Bill Cosby was funny.\n\n2:00:32.900 --> 2:00:36.540\n You know, like that's a funny comedian,\n\n2:00:36.540 --> 2:00:40.180\n but you know the other stuff.\n\n2:00:40.180 --> 2:00:43.580\n Michael Jackson, he could fucking dance.\n\n2:00:43.580 --> 2:00:44.420\n And sing.\n\n2:00:44.420 --> 2:00:46.260\n And sing, but there's some other stuff.\n\n2:00:46.260 --> 2:00:50.180\n But regardless, Hakeem Bey came up with the idea\n\n2:00:50.180 --> 2:00:53.860\n of something called a temporary autonomous zone,\n\n2:00:53.860 --> 2:00:58.780\n which is that within a structure, a cultural structure,\n\n2:00:58.780 --> 2:01:03.780\n a temporary bubble of freedom will appear\n\n2:01:04.220 --> 2:01:09.220\n that by its nature gets sort of popped\n\n2:01:09.420 --> 2:01:11.420\n by the bigger bubble,\n\n2:01:11.420 --> 2:01:13.860\n or it runs out of resources generally is what happens.\n\n2:01:13.860 --> 2:01:17.160\n So these things will appear just out of the blue\n\n2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:22.160\n that it's almost like, imagine if like on earth\n\n2:01:22.420 --> 2:01:25.120\n in some tiny little bit of earth,\n\n2:01:25.120 --> 2:01:29.020\n the gravitational field was reduced by some percentage.\n\n2:01:29.020 --> 2:01:31.380\n And all of a sudden you could jump really high or whatever,\n\n2:01:31.380 --> 2:01:32.220\n but it wouldn't last.\n\n2:01:32.220 --> 2:01:35.140\n It's like that culturally, all the restrictions\n\n2:01:35.140 --> 2:01:37.280\n and the darkness and the heaviness and all of it\n\n2:01:37.280 --> 2:01:40.180\n for a second, somehow this bubble appears\n\n2:01:40.180 --> 2:01:45.180\n where humans come together as the hippie ideal.\n\n2:01:45.900 --> 2:01:50.060\n Brothers, sisters, just humans, earthlings\n\n2:01:50.060 --> 2:01:55.060\n instead of American, Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian\n\n2:01:55.640 --> 2:01:58.440\n temporary autonomous zone, it gets crushed\n\n2:01:58.440 --> 2:02:01.360\n by the default reality that it was appearing in.\n\n2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:03.940\n But somehow within that space,\n\n2:02:03.940 --> 2:02:08.500\n you witness the possibility, the possibility,\n\n2:02:08.500 --> 2:02:12.020\n the frustrating possibility that anyone who's thought\n\n2:02:12.020 --> 2:02:16.060\n about humanity knows this possibility,\n\n2:02:16.060 --> 2:02:18.580\n which is like, it seems like we can just get along.\n\n2:02:18.580 --> 2:02:21.420\n Like it does seem like we're pretty much the same thing\n\n2:02:21.420 --> 2:02:23.660\n and that we can just get along.\n\n2:02:23.660 --> 2:02:26.740\n Those moments are really rare.\n\n2:02:26.740 --> 2:02:27.580\n It's sad.\n\n2:02:27.580 --> 2:02:30.060\n I talked to a lot of soldiers, a lot of people\n\n2:02:30.060 --> 2:02:35.060\n that suffered through the different aspects of that war.\n\n2:02:35.060 --> 2:02:40.060\n Or war, and there's an information war\n\n2:02:40.220 --> 2:02:44.260\n that convinces each side that the other\n\n2:02:44.260 --> 2:02:47.380\n is not just the enemy, but less than human.\n\n2:02:47.380 --> 2:02:48.220\n Right.\n\n2:02:48.220 --> 2:02:52.180\n So there's a real hatred towards the other side.\n\n2:02:52.180 --> 2:02:53.180\n Yeah.\n\n2:02:53.180 --> 2:02:56.700\n And those kind of little moments where you realize,\n\n2:02:56.700 --> 2:03:00.140\n oh, they're human like me.\n\n2:03:00.140 --> 2:03:00.980\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:00.980 --> 2:03:03.460\n And not just like human like me,\n\n2:03:03.460 --> 2:03:06.500\n but they have the same values as me.\n\n2:03:06.500 --> 2:03:11.500\n And this woman who was a really respected soldier,\n\n2:03:13.980 --> 2:03:18.580\n she specializes in anti tank missiles.\n\n2:03:18.580 --> 2:03:23.140\n And she's very kind of, very pragmatic,\n\n2:03:23.140 --> 2:03:26.780\n very the enemy is the enemy, you have to destroy the enemy\n\n2:03:26.780 --> 2:03:29.700\n and saying like, there's no compassion towards the enemy.\n\n2:03:29.700 --> 2:03:31.540\n They're not human.\n\n2:03:31.540 --> 2:03:33.700\n They're less than human.\n\n2:03:33.700 --> 2:03:38.580\n But she said there was a moment when she remembers\n\n2:03:38.580 --> 2:03:43.580\n an enemy soldier in a tank took a risk\n\n2:03:43.700 --> 2:03:45.620\n to save a fellow soldier.\n\n2:03:45.620 --> 2:03:48.220\n And that risk was really stupid because he was facing,\n\n2:03:48.220 --> 2:03:50.020\n he was going to get destroyed.\n\n2:03:50.020 --> 2:03:55.020\n And then she said that she tried to shoot a rocket\n\n2:03:57.660 --> 2:03:59.940\n at that tank and she missed.\n\n2:03:59.940 --> 2:04:02.340\n And then she later went home and she couldn't sleep\n\n2:04:02.340 --> 2:04:03.180\n that she missed.\n\n2:04:03.180 --> 2:04:05.180\n How could she screw that up?\n\n2:04:05.180 --> 2:04:09.220\n But then she realized that actually she missed,\n\n2:04:09.220 --> 2:04:10.780\n maybe she missed on purpose.\n\n2:04:10.780 --> 2:04:11.620\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:11.620 --> 2:04:16.620\n Because she realized that that man, just like she is,\n\n2:04:16.820 --> 2:04:21.220\n was a hero, just like she strives to be.\n\n2:04:21.220 --> 2:04:24.940\n They were both heroes defending their own.\n\n2:04:24.940 --> 2:04:27.980\n And in that way, he was just like her.\n\n2:04:27.980 --> 2:04:30.380\n She was like, that's the only time I remember during this\n\n2:04:30.380 --> 2:04:33.580\n war ever feeling like this is another human being.\n\n2:04:33.580 --> 2:04:36.540\n But that was a very brief moment for her.\n\n2:04:36.540 --> 2:04:39.420\n And I just hear that over and over and over again.\n\n2:04:39.420 --> 2:04:44.420\n These romantic notions we have of we're one,\n\n2:04:44.460 --> 2:04:46.340\n that we're all just human.\n\n2:04:46.340 --> 2:04:50.820\n Unfortunately during war, those notions are rare.\n\n2:04:50.820 --> 2:04:51.780\n And it's quite sad.\n\n2:04:51.780 --> 2:04:54.940\n And war in a certain way really destroys those notions.\n\n2:04:54.940 --> 2:04:59.540\n And one of the saddest things is it destroys it,\n\n2:05:01.020 --> 2:05:05.860\n at least from what I see, potentially for generations.\n\n2:05:05.860 --> 2:05:08.220\n Not just for those people for the rest of their life,\n\n2:05:08.220 --> 2:05:12.100\n but for their children, their children's children.\n\n2:05:12.100 --> 2:05:13.780\n The hatred.\n\n2:05:13.780 --> 2:05:16.060\n I mean, I ask that question of basically everyone,\n\n2:05:16.060 --> 2:05:20.700\n which is will you ever forgive, asking of Ukrainians,\n\n2:05:20.700 --> 2:05:22.860\n will you ever forgive the Russians?\n\n2:05:22.860 --> 2:05:27.060\n Will, do you have hate in your heart towards the Russians?\n\n2:05:27.060 --> 2:05:32.060\n Or do you have love for a fellow human being?\n\n2:05:32.140 --> 2:05:36.580\n And there's different ways that people struggle with that.\n\n2:05:36.580 --> 2:05:40.660\n Different people, they saw that, they saw the love,\n\n2:05:40.660 --> 2:05:43.460\n they saw the hate with their known heart.\n\n2:05:43.460 --> 2:05:45.380\n And they struggle with the hate they have.\n\n2:05:45.380 --> 2:05:48.580\n And they know they can overcome it in a period of weeks\n\n2:05:48.580 --> 2:05:50.820\n and months after the war is over.\n\n2:05:50.820 --> 2:05:53.620\n But some people said, no, this hate that was,\n\n2:05:53.620 --> 2:05:56.540\n that showed up in February when the war started\n\n2:05:56.540 --> 2:05:57.820\n will be with me forever.\n\n2:05:57.820 --> 2:06:00.220\n Well, yeah, their kids got killed.\n\n2:06:00.220 --> 2:06:02.140\n What the fuck are you gonna do about that?\n\n2:06:02.140 --> 2:06:02.980\n Like, I don't care.\n\n2:06:02.980 --> 2:06:06.820\n I've got aphorisms and cute little stories about,\n\n2:06:06.820 --> 2:06:10.140\n you're still in prison if you hate your former captors.\n\n2:06:10.140 --> 2:06:14.220\n But man, I gotta tell you, if somebody hurt my kids,\n\n2:06:14.220 --> 2:06:15.180\n I'm not coming back.\n\n2:06:15.180 --> 2:06:18.140\n I mean, there's no amount,\n\n2:06:18.140 --> 2:06:21.060\n at least right now in my approximation,\n\n2:06:21.060 --> 2:06:24.860\n of spiritual literature, meditation,\n\n2:06:24.860 --> 2:06:26.700\n or anything that I can really think of\n\n2:06:26.700 --> 2:06:31.180\n that is going to give me that kind of space.\n\n2:06:31.180 --> 2:06:34.420\n Like, I think I imagine in the same way like,\n\n2:06:36.340 --> 2:06:39.060\n I imagine I could probably run a marathon eventually,\n\n2:06:39.060 --> 2:06:42.700\n but do I think I'm ever gonna do that?\n\n2:06:42.700 --> 2:06:44.100\n That times a million.\n\n2:06:44.100 --> 2:06:47.900\n So man, all we can do is have compassion for their hate\n\n2:06:47.900 --> 2:06:51.940\n because it's like, what are you gonna say?\n\n2:06:51.940 --> 2:06:53.580\n What are you gonna say to someone like that?\n\n2:06:53.580 --> 2:06:58.580\n Oh, oh, you know, for the sake of humanity, let it go.\n\n2:06:58.780 --> 2:07:00.380\n It was just your kids.\n\n2:07:00.380 --> 2:07:02.580\n It was just something you loved\n\n2:07:02.580 --> 2:07:05.300\n more than anything in the world.\n\n2:07:05.300 --> 2:07:07.060\n You'll never be okay again.\n\n2:07:07.060 --> 2:07:09.380\n You're gonna have nightmares for the rest of your life.\n\n2:07:09.380 --> 2:07:10.980\n But you should forgive.\n\n2:07:10.980 --> 2:07:11.820\n No.\n\n2:07:11.820 --> 2:07:12.980\n Well, there is truth in the fact\n\n2:07:12.980 --> 2:07:15.780\n that forgiveness is the way to let go, right?\n\n2:07:15.780 --> 2:07:20.780\n But that truth is not, fuck you, right?\n\n2:07:23.420 --> 2:07:26.100\n Which is why it's not your job to say that.\n\n2:07:26.100 --> 2:07:28.500\n Not that you're doing that, I know you're not.\n\n2:07:28.500 --> 2:07:30.660\n But you know, the problem with people like me,\n\n2:07:31.620 --> 2:07:34.740\n early phase, you could get this stupid missionary thing\n\n2:07:34.740 --> 2:07:37.220\n going where you like, start trying to like,\n\n2:07:38.580 --> 2:07:40.780\n I don't know, like proselytize ideals\n\n2:07:40.780 --> 2:07:42.660\n that you might be incapable of, you know?\n\n2:07:42.660 --> 2:07:46.660\n And I just, hearing it, you know, that's the,\n\n2:07:46.660 --> 2:07:49.500\n man, I saw this, the thing that like,\n\n2:07:49.500 --> 2:07:51.220\n I mean, I've seen a lot, all of us by now,\n\n2:07:51.220 --> 2:07:53.420\n probably if we were online, I've seen,\n\n2:07:53.420 --> 2:07:54.900\n and you just saw it in person.\n\n2:07:54.900 --> 2:07:58.740\n Like we've seen things that are just horrific.\n\n2:07:58.740 --> 2:08:03.420\n But as a dad, man, I just saw this clip of this kid\n\n2:08:03.420 --> 2:08:08.220\n around the age of my kid, walking by himself,\n\n2:08:08.220 --> 2:08:11.100\n these refugees, just walking by himself,\n\n2:08:11.100 --> 2:08:13.340\n crying, the look on his face,\n\n2:08:13.340 --> 2:08:15.780\n I can't explain the look on his face.\n\n2:08:15.780 --> 2:08:17.060\n I don't know what happened to his parents.\n\n2:08:17.060 --> 2:08:18.340\n I don't know what happened.\n\n2:08:18.340 --> 2:08:21.340\n Like I, it was so upsetting.\n\n2:08:21.340 --> 2:08:23.580\n Like even thinking about it now, it's just like, fuck,\n\n2:08:23.580 --> 2:08:24.660\n that could have been my kid.\n\n2:08:24.660 --> 2:08:26.860\n That could have been my kid, you know?\n\n2:08:26.860 --> 2:08:29.340\n So knowing that kind of, that,\n\n2:08:30.500 --> 2:08:33.500\n that kid's gotta grow up now.\n\n2:08:33.500 --> 2:08:36.220\n And I don't know, is the kid's parents still there?\n\n2:08:36.220 --> 2:08:41.220\n And that's just one of countless orphans out there now.\n\n2:08:42.860 --> 2:08:45.180\n So what you have this hate,\n\n2:08:45.180 --> 2:08:47.860\n and the question is how to direct it.\n\n2:08:47.860 --> 2:08:50.500\n Because the choice is you can direct it\n\n2:08:50.500 --> 2:08:53.340\n towards the politicians that started the war.\n\n2:08:53.340 --> 2:08:55.100\n You can direct it towards the soldiers\n\n2:08:55.100 --> 2:08:56.700\n that are doing the killing,\n\n2:08:56.700 --> 2:08:59.500\n or you can direct it towards an entire group of people.\n\n2:09:00.460 --> 2:09:04.060\n And that's the struggle because hate slowly grows\n\n2:09:04.060 --> 2:09:08.420\n to where you don't just hate the soldiers.\n\n2:09:08.420 --> 2:09:11.580\n You don't just hate the leaders.\n\n2:09:11.580 --> 2:09:16.580\n You hate all Russians because they're all equally evil\n\n2:09:17.300 --> 2:09:19.980\n because the ones that aren't doing the fighting\n\n2:09:19.980 --> 2:09:21.660\n are staying quiet.\n\n2:09:21.660 --> 2:09:24.140\n And I'm sure the same kind of stories are happening\n\n2:09:24.140 --> 2:09:25.420\n on the other side.\n\n2:09:25.420 --> 2:09:30.420\n And so there is, that hate is one\n\n2:09:30.420 --> 2:09:35.420\n that is deeply human,\n\n2:09:38.740 --> 2:09:43.620\n but you wonder for your own future, for your own home,\n\n2:09:43.620 --> 2:09:45.500\n for building your own community,\n\n2:09:45.500 --> 2:09:47.660\n for building your own country,\n\n2:09:47.660 --> 2:09:52.660\n how does that hate morph over the weeks and months and years?\n\n2:09:53.140 --> 2:09:56.220\n Not into forgiveness, but into something that's productive\n\n2:09:56.220 --> 2:09:57.820\n that doesn't destroy you.\n\n2:09:57.820 --> 2:09:59.560\n Because hate does destroy.\n\n2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:04.560\n That's the dark aspect of a rocket that hits a building\n\n2:10:06.220 --> 2:10:08.700\n and kills hundreds of people.\n\n2:10:10.900 --> 2:10:13.060\n The worst effect of that rocket\n\n2:10:16.540 --> 2:10:20.500\n is the hate in the hearts of the loved ones\n\n2:10:21.620 --> 2:10:23.980\n to the people that were in that building.\n\n2:10:23.980 --> 2:10:28.980\n That hate is a torture over a period of years after.\n\n2:10:30.100 --> 2:10:32.540\n And that it doesn't just torture\n\n2:10:33.500 --> 2:10:36.340\n by having that psychological burden and trauma.\n\n2:10:36.340 --> 2:10:39.620\n It also tortures because it destroys your life.\n\n2:10:39.620 --> 2:10:42.460\n It prevents you from being able to enjoy your life\n\n2:10:42.460 --> 2:10:44.420\n to the fullest.\n\n2:10:44.420 --> 2:10:49.300\n It prevents you from being able to flourish as a human being,\n\n2:10:49.300 --> 2:10:53.700\n as a professional, in all those kinds of ways\n\n2:10:53.700 --> 2:10:54.980\n that humans can flourish.\n\n2:10:54.980 --> 2:10:57.100\n And I don't know.\n\n2:10:57.100 --> 2:11:02.100\n It's such a, there is an aspect where this naive notion\n\n2:11:05.740 --> 2:11:09.100\n is really powerful, that love and forgiveness\n\n2:11:09.100 --> 2:11:12.340\n is the thing that's needed in this time.\n\n2:11:12.340 --> 2:11:16.580\n And when I talk to soldiers, they don't,\n\n2:11:18.380 --> 2:11:21.620\n I remember bringing up to Jaco,\n\n2:11:21.620 --> 2:11:23.820\n is there a sense where the people you're fighting\n\n2:11:23.820 --> 2:11:25.180\n are just brothers in arms,\n\n2:11:25.180 --> 2:11:27.780\n bringing up the Dire Straits song, Brothers in Arms?\n\n2:11:28.820 --> 2:11:31.880\n And he was basically, without swearing, saying fuck that,\n\n2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:33.060\n that they're the enemy.\n\n2:11:33.060 --> 2:11:36.380\n Yeah, I mean, he's literally in survival mode.\n\n2:11:36.380 --> 2:11:37.380\n He can't think like that.\n\n2:11:37.380 --> 2:11:39.220\n It's gonna create latency in the system\n\n2:11:39.220 --> 2:11:40.860\n and that's gonna lower his survivability.\n\n2:11:40.860 --> 2:11:41.700\n You can't think that.\n\n2:11:41.700 --> 2:11:44.300\n I mean, we're talking about cognitively.\n\n2:11:44.300 --> 2:11:45.660\n You can't have latency.\n\n2:11:45.660 --> 2:11:49.100\n Like, if you're, that one moment of hesitation,\n\n2:11:49.100 --> 2:11:51.300\n you see it sometimes in these YouTube videos\n\n2:11:51.300 --> 2:11:56.300\n of like somebody, a new cop has been unfortunate enough\n\n2:11:59.220 --> 2:12:03.060\n to run into something that is a phenomenon, suicide by cop.\n\n2:12:03.060 --> 2:12:07.060\n Somebody has a knife and that person is running towards them\n\n2:12:07.060 --> 2:12:10.940\n with a knife and they're begging the person to stop,\n\n2:12:10.940 --> 2:12:12.460\n that you can hear it in their voice.\n\n2:12:12.460 --> 2:12:17.260\n They're begging, stop, stop, stop, stop.\n\n2:12:17.260 --> 2:12:19.220\n And the person is not gonna stop.\n\n2:12:19.220 --> 2:12:24.220\n So the critique of that is that that latency\n\n2:12:27.860 --> 2:12:31.000\n could potentially not just lead to the cop getting killed,\n\n2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:34.380\n but to that person with a knife killing other people.\n\n2:12:34.380 --> 2:12:39.300\n And so, you know, I get, if I were out there,\n\n2:12:39.300 --> 2:12:44.300\n I think that like, you probably just as a matter\n\n2:12:44.340 --> 2:12:47.900\n of like not getting shot and being fully in the moment,\n\n2:12:47.900 --> 2:12:48.860\n you have to be like that.\n\n2:12:48.860 --> 2:12:50.140\n I would guess, I don't know.\n\n2:12:50.140 --> 2:12:51.300\n I don't know, I'm the furthest thing\n\n2:12:51.300 --> 2:12:52.300\n from a soldier there could be,\n\n2:12:52.300 --> 2:12:57.300\n but there's something Jack Kornfield,\n\n2:12:57.580 --> 2:12:58.720\n this great Buddhist teacher says,\n\n2:12:58.720 --> 2:13:03.420\n which is tend to the part of the garden you can touch.\n\n2:13:03.420 --> 2:13:05.900\n Meaning this is where we're at right now.\n\n2:13:05.900 --> 2:13:09.220\n Thank God you and I, though we are experiencing\n\n2:13:09.220 --> 2:13:11.980\n some like ripples from what's going on over there,\n\n2:13:11.980 --> 2:13:14.220\n everyone is, we're not there.\n\n2:13:14.220 --> 2:13:17.460\n And thank God we don't have to come up\n\n2:13:17.460 --> 2:13:21.860\n with the psychological program\n\n2:13:21.860 --> 2:13:24.020\n for people going through that\n\n2:13:24.020 --> 2:13:27.620\n to no longer be encumbered by that hate.\n\n2:13:27.620 --> 2:13:28.460\n Thank God.\n\n2:13:28.460 --> 2:13:30.220\n And I don't know if that's just lazy or whatever,\n\n2:13:30.220 --> 2:13:31.940\n but it's like, you know, for me,\n\n2:13:31.940 --> 2:13:33.500\n I just, I have to bring it back to,\n\n2:13:33.500 --> 2:13:35.600\n all right, well, here's where I'm at now.\n\n2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:40.600\n And I don't want there to be war.\n\n2:13:41.160 --> 2:13:44.660\n I don't want to hurt people, but yeah, I love what you said.\n\n2:13:44.660 --> 2:13:47.660\n I think what you said is the, if anything,\n\n2:13:47.660 --> 2:13:52.500\n is the most intelligent way of looking at it.\n\n2:13:52.500 --> 2:13:55.820\n It's like, don't pretend that you're not gonna feel\n\n2:13:55.820 --> 2:13:58.360\n that hate, like you're gonna feel it.\n\n2:13:58.360 --> 2:13:59.200\n There's no way around it.\n\n2:13:59.200 --> 2:14:00.500\n Or like, cause that's even worse.\n\n2:14:00.500 --> 2:14:02.200\n Cause then you're almost saying like something's wrong\n\n2:14:02.200 --> 2:14:05.300\n with them for feeling the hate or, you know, whatever.\n\n2:14:05.300 --> 2:14:09.300\n But more along the lines, if you can avoid applying\n\n2:14:09.300 --> 2:14:14.300\n that hate to an entire country of people, then do that.\n\n2:14:18.060 --> 2:14:20.640\n Like, just understand, we're talking about like a,\n\n2:14:24.260 --> 2:14:25.140\n not everybody.\n\n2:14:25.140 --> 2:14:26.500\n I know it's not everybody.\n\n2:14:26.500 --> 2:14:27.580\n I know it's not everybody.\n\n2:14:27.580 --> 2:14:28.660\n It's just easier, isn't it?\n\n2:14:28.660 --> 2:14:33.660\n Cognitively, it's somehow easier to think all Russians,\n\n2:14:33.940 --> 2:14:37.860\n monsters, you know, all Russians,\n\n2:14:37.860 --> 2:14:40.100\n all whatever the particular like thing is\n\n2:14:40.100 --> 2:14:42.060\n that you're supposed to not like.\n\n2:14:42.060 --> 2:14:43.920\n It's easier somehow, weirdly.\n\n2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:45.900\n You'd think that'd be more difficult.\n\n2:14:45.900 --> 2:14:50.900\n Yeah, but I guess the lesson is if you give in\n\n2:14:50.900 --> 2:14:55.660\n to the easy solution, that's going to lead\n\n2:14:55.660 --> 2:14:58.280\n to detrimental longterm effects.\n\n2:14:58.280 --> 2:15:03.280\n So hate should be, it's such a powerful tool\n\n2:15:03.280 --> 2:15:08.280\n that you should try to control it for your own sake.\n\n2:15:08.520 --> 2:15:10.320\n Not because you owe anything to anybody,\n\n2:15:10.320 --> 2:15:14.520\n but for your own psychological development over time.\n\n2:15:14.520 --> 2:15:19.080\n Right, right, that's it, that's it, fuck.\n\n2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:21.400\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:15:21.400 --> 2:15:25.700\n In terms of dark places, you suffered from depression.\n\n2:15:26.640 --> 2:15:28.360\n Where has been some of the darker places\n\n2:15:28.360 --> 2:15:30.200\n you've gone in your mind?\n\n2:15:31.480 --> 2:15:32.720\n You know, I needed therapy, man.\n\n2:15:32.720 --> 2:15:36.640\n I needed therapy for the longest time, I just didn't get it.\n\n2:15:36.640 --> 2:15:41.640\n So because of that, I would go through like bouts\n\n2:15:44.360 --> 2:15:49.360\n of like paralytic depression, like suicidal depression,\n\n2:15:49.400 --> 2:15:51.760\n suicidal ideations that were more than just ideations.\n\n2:15:51.760 --> 2:15:56.320\n I mean, I think like people get afraid\n\n2:15:56.320 --> 2:15:59.540\n when the thought of suicide appears in their consciousness,\n\n2:15:59.540 --> 2:16:01.160\n they get really scared of themselves.\n\n2:16:01.160 --> 2:16:03.100\n So they think there's something like,\n\n2:16:03.100 --> 2:16:04.120\n fuck, what's going on with me?\n\n2:16:04.120 --> 2:16:04.960\n Why would I think that?\n\n2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:08.080\n But I think if we are suffering and, you know,\n\n2:16:08.080 --> 2:16:11.280\n as a natural part of not wanting to reduce suffering\n\n2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:16.040\n or not feel bad anymore, I mean, suicide is going to be an,\n\n2:16:16.040 --> 2:16:17.400\n like, if we're just, you know, you're just looking,\n\n2:16:17.400 --> 2:16:18.280\n what are all the options?\n\n2:16:18.280 --> 2:16:19.920\n Let's brainstorm here.\n\n2:16:19.920 --> 2:16:20.760\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:16:20.760 --> 2:16:22.480\n I could start drinking more water.\n\n2:16:22.480 --> 2:16:26.120\n You start jogging, get some therapy, call my friends,\n\n2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:27.840\n all the stuff we all hear.\n\n2:16:27.840 --> 2:16:30.200\n Or I could just, I think the height\n\n2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:31.920\n of my apartment building is probably the,\n\n2:16:31.920 --> 2:16:34.520\n definitely the right height to kill myself.\n\n2:16:34.520 --> 2:16:39.120\n And then, so where, for me, like the few times\n\n2:16:39.120 --> 2:16:41.720\n where the ideation has gone towards like,\n\n2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:45.480\n well, when would I do that?\n\n2:16:45.480 --> 2:16:47.480\n How do I, what, you know, what do I need\n\n2:16:47.480 --> 2:16:50.080\n to like accomplish that?\n\n2:16:50.080 --> 2:16:52.940\n When then like, that's where it gets really fucking scary.\n\n2:16:52.940 --> 2:16:54.400\n That's where it's like terrifying.\n\n2:16:54.400 --> 2:16:57.800\n And so you start the actual details of the planning\n\n2:16:57.800 --> 2:17:00.080\n of how to commit suicide.\n\n2:17:00.080 --> 2:17:00.960\n Yeah.\n\n2:17:00.960 --> 2:17:02.760\n What's going to be the least painful way to do it?\n\n2:17:02.760 --> 2:17:04.680\n What's going to be the most instantaneous way to do it?\n\n2:17:04.680 --> 2:17:06.640\n What's the, you know, and with, you know,\n\n2:17:06.640 --> 2:17:11.080\n with depression, because it can be progressive,\n\n2:17:11.080 --> 2:17:13.600\n you know, this is why you have to really just stay\n\n2:17:13.600 --> 2:17:14.440\n on top of it.\n\n2:17:14.440 --> 2:17:15.360\n Anyone who's gone through depression\n\n2:17:15.360 --> 2:17:16.240\n knows what I'm talking about.\n\n2:17:16.240 --> 2:17:17.320\n You gotta stay on top of it.\n\n2:17:17.320 --> 2:17:18.600\n Like you might need medication.\n\n2:17:18.600 --> 2:17:20.560\n You know, I know this is controversial now,\n\n2:17:20.560 --> 2:17:22.720\n but it's still better than dying if you ask me.\n\n2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:24.800\n But at some point with depression,\n\n2:17:24.800 --> 2:17:26.620\n it like becomes paralyzing.\n\n2:17:26.620 --> 2:17:28.200\n So you don't want to get out of bed anymore\n\n2:17:28.200 --> 2:17:30.060\n and you're not taking showers anymore.\n\n2:17:30.060 --> 2:17:31.680\n And you don't want to talk to anybody anymore.\n\n2:17:31.680 --> 2:17:33.160\n And you're not answering your phone anymore.\n\n2:17:33.160 --> 2:17:35.200\n And, you know.\n\n2:17:35.200 --> 2:17:38.360\n So like in a dark place that you might be in,\n\n2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:39.840\n it still might get worse.\n\n2:17:39.840 --> 2:17:43.760\n So you should really do everything you can\n\n2:17:43.760 --> 2:17:45.400\n to get under control.\n\n2:17:45.400 --> 2:17:47.440\n And that's the problem with that specific\n\n2:17:47.440 --> 2:17:49.380\n psychological disorder.\n\n2:17:49.380 --> 2:17:50.440\n That's the problem.\n\n2:17:50.440 --> 2:17:52.480\n Because the things it's like,\n\n2:17:52.480 --> 2:17:54.880\n if you start listening to what you want to,\n\n2:17:54.880 --> 2:17:56.600\n you think it's you, it's the depression.\n\n2:17:56.600 --> 2:17:58.320\n You start listening to it.\n\n2:17:58.320 --> 2:18:00.840\n It wants you to stay in bed.\n\n2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:03.960\n And then you're getting those fucking depression sleeps,\n\n2:18:03.960 --> 2:18:06.400\n you know, or you wake up and you're more tired.\n\n2:18:06.400 --> 2:18:07.760\n Like it's not working.\n\n2:18:07.760 --> 2:18:11.360\n You're trying to escape reality by sleeping.\n\n2:18:11.360 --> 2:18:13.680\n And so, yeah.\n\n2:18:13.680 --> 2:18:15.600\n Like you have to like,\n\n2:18:15.600 --> 2:18:18.360\n you're fighting for your,\n\n2:18:18.360 --> 2:18:19.800\n you're literally fighting for your life.\n\n2:18:19.800 --> 2:18:20.840\n It might not seem like that.\n\n2:18:20.840 --> 2:18:23.460\n Cause you can't, if you could see depression,\n\n2:18:23.460 --> 2:18:24.300\n if you could see it,\n\n2:18:24.300 --> 2:18:28.920\n if you knew you had some inky, vaporous octopus thing\n\n2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:31.320\n that was just wrapping around you\n\n2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:33.280\n more and more and more and more,\n\n2:18:33.280 --> 2:18:34.600\n you would probably do everything you could\n\n2:18:34.600 --> 2:18:36.120\n to rip that fucking thing off your body.\n\n2:18:36.120 --> 2:18:38.000\n And if you couldn't get it off your body,\n\n2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:41.120\n you would be calling people to get help.\n\n2:18:41.120 --> 2:18:43.520\n So it doesn't feel like a fight because you're exhausted.\n\n2:18:43.520 --> 2:18:45.280\n There's no reason to move.\n\n2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:48.000\n There's no, you don't see the meaning for any of it.\n\n2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:50.200\n So it doesn't feel like a battle, but it is a battle.\n\n2:18:50.200 --> 2:18:51.040\n You're not feeling.\n\n2:18:51.040 --> 2:18:51.860\n I mean, that's the other thing.\n\n2:18:51.860 --> 2:18:53.560\n You're just, you're basically not feeling.\n\n2:18:53.560 --> 2:18:55.600\n You're like, you start going numb.\n\n2:18:55.600 --> 2:18:57.520\n At least that was my experience with it.\n\n2:18:57.520 --> 2:18:58.760\n Numb and tired.\n\n2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:01.420\n And then increasingly numb and tired.\n\n2:19:01.420 --> 2:19:05.240\n And then increasingly sort of disconnecting from reality.\n\n2:19:05.240 --> 2:19:06.360\n And then somewhere in there,\n\n2:19:06.360 --> 2:19:08.840\n that's when you start playing around with the idea\n\n2:19:08.840 --> 2:19:10.680\n of like, oh, I don't know if it's worth it.\n\n2:19:10.680 --> 2:19:11.520\n I don't know.\n\n2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:14.640\n Now, you know, I think compared to some of my friends\n\n2:19:14.640 --> 2:19:15.940\n who haven't survived,\n\n2:19:15.940 --> 2:19:17.920\n obviously who haven't survived depression,\n\n2:19:17.920 --> 2:19:21.840\n like mine was definitely not whatever theirs was like.\n\n2:19:21.840 --> 2:19:26.320\n I've heard, I mean, to understand it for folks out there,\n\n2:19:26.320 --> 2:19:27.280\n maybe you haven't gone through it.\n\n2:19:27.280 --> 2:19:30.560\n Just imagine if like, how bad you have to feel\n\n2:19:30.560 --> 2:19:32.720\n if death is the solution,\n\n2:19:32.720 --> 2:19:35.200\n like violence against yourself\n\n2:19:35.200 --> 2:19:37.120\n so that you die is the solution.\n\n2:19:37.120 --> 2:19:42.120\n Like just, it flies in the face of everything.\n\n2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:48.080\n So yeah, that was definitely the darkest place\n\n2:19:48.100 --> 2:19:48.940\n that I've ever been.\n\n2:19:48.940 --> 2:19:52.440\n Just that death doesn't seem like, because you don't care\n\n2:19:52.440 --> 2:19:54.160\n about anything anymore,\n\n2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:56.440\n that death just doesn't seem like that bad.\n\n2:19:56.440 --> 2:19:57.280\n Yeah.\n\n2:19:58.580 --> 2:20:01.440\n Like you're not able to appropriately assign\n\n2:20:02.720 --> 2:20:05.620\n the negative costs to the solution.\n\n2:20:05.620 --> 2:20:06.460\n Right.\n\n2:20:06.460 --> 2:20:07.820\n It just seems like a reasonable solution.\n\n2:20:07.820 --> 2:20:11.840\n Yeah, but I think also what's going along with it\n\n2:20:11.840 --> 2:20:15.280\n is like, it's not like your brain isn't working.\n\n2:20:15.280 --> 2:20:17.600\n Like you're not thinking,\n\n2:20:17.600 --> 2:20:19.240\n obviously you're not thinking clearly.\n\n2:20:19.240 --> 2:20:22.760\n Like, at least again, this was my experience of it.\n\n2:20:22.760 --> 2:20:23.920\n It's a fog.\n\n2:20:23.920 --> 2:20:27.640\n You're in some kind of, like you're confused.\n\n2:20:27.640 --> 2:20:29.160\n There's confusion.\n\n2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:31.280\n There's shame.\n\n2:20:31.280 --> 2:20:32.200\n You feel embarrassed.\n\n2:20:32.200 --> 2:20:33.140\n You feel embarrassed.\n\n2:20:33.140 --> 2:20:34.040\n You wanna get out of bed.\n\n2:20:34.040 --> 2:20:34.920\n You wanna do stuff.\n\n2:20:34.920 --> 2:20:38.360\n You wanna be compelled to be social and do all this stuff,\n\n2:20:38.360 --> 2:20:40.480\n but you're not, you're not.\n\n2:20:40.480 --> 2:20:42.800\n Like you seem, if people don't know what's going on\n\n2:20:42.800 --> 2:20:45.120\n and you're not telling them because you're embarrassed,\n\n2:20:45.120 --> 2:20:48.880\n because you want to have some like,\n\n2:20:48.880 --> 2:20:53.880\n you know, uncorrupted, unworped psyche,\n\n2:20:54.100 --> 2:20:57.920\n you know, you're like, it invites you to be secret about it.\n\n2:20:57.920 --> 2:20:59.400\n That's one of its first tricks\n\n2:20:59.400 --> 2:21:01.640\n is it tells you not to tell anybody.\n\n2:21:01.640 --> 2:21:06.320\n And that's deadly in that case, it's deadly.\n\n2:21:06.320 --> 2:21:07.840\n What was the source of light?\n\n2:21:07.840 --> 2:21:11.840\n What was the, what were for you\n\n2:21:11.840 --> 2:21:14.200\n and in general the ways out?\n\n2:21:14.200 --> 2:21:19.120\n Yeah, so for me, the solutions,\n\n2:21:19.120 --> 2:21:22.120\n and again, man, for my depressed friends out there,\n\n2:21:22.120 --> 2:21:23.140\n please don't get mad at me.\n\n2:21:23.140 --> 2:21:24.200\n I'm not doing the thing of like,\n\n2:21:24.200 --> 2:21:26.800\n just put on a smile or any of that bullshit\n\n2:21:26.800 --> 2:21:28.040\n because it doesn't feel like that\n\n2:21:28.040 --> 2:21:31.920\n when you're like, and when you're fighting it,\n\n2:21:31.920 --> 2:21:35.260\n it's like you are, you're in a,\n\n2:21:36.680 --> 2:21:39.360\n I don't know why I keep using these stupid gravity analogies,\n\n2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:42.240\n but it's like the gravity's been turned up on your planet\n\n2:21:42.240 --> 2:21:45.400\n in every single way by, so getting out of bed.\n\n2:21:45.400 --> 2:21:46.240\n You know, like.\n\n2:21:47.840 --> 2:21:50.640\n By the way, gravity and quantum mechanics,\n\n2:21:50.640 --> 2:21:54.040\n one of the most beautiful things about our reality,\n\n2:21:54.040 --> 2:21:56.720\n what the hell is each of those things?\n\n2:21:56.720 --> 2:22:00.880\n So this isn't, you're not just talking about\n\n2:22:00.880 --> 2:22:04.120\n hippie language, it's still physicists\n\n2:22:04.120 --> 2:22:05.920\n pretend they understand something.\n\n2:22:05.920 --> 2:22:07.840\n We're still at the very beginning of understanding\n\n2:22:07.840 --> 2:22:09.680\n this mysterious world of ours\n\n2:22:09.680 --> 2:22:11.640\n that seems to be functioning according\n\n2:22:11.640 --> 2:22:16.640\n to these weirdly simple and yet universally powerful laws,\n\n2:22:18.080 --> 2:22:20.680\n which we don't fully yet understand.\n\n2:22:20.680 --> 2:22:24.040\n So please, the metaphor and the analogy of gravity.\n\n2:22:24.040 --> 2:22:24.880\n Okay, thank you.\n\n2:22:24.880 --> 2:22:25.700\n Fully, fully applicable.\n\n2:22:25.700 --> 2:22:26.540\n I don't know any other way to put it\n\n2:22:26.540 --> 2:22:28.520\n than it's like somebody turned the gravitational field\n\n2:22:28.520 --> 2:22:29.720\n of your mattress up by.\n\n2:22:29.720 --> 2:22:30.680\n So everything is heavy.\n\n2:22:30.680 --> 2:22:33.060\n Heavy, your body's heavy.\n\n2:22:33.060 --> 2:22:34.020\n You don't wanna get out of bed,\n\n2:22:34.020 --> 2:22:36.800\n you will consider shitting or pissing the bed\n\n2:22:36.800 --> 2:22:38.180\n because you're just like, who gives a fuck,\n\n2:22:38.180 --> 2:22:40.280\n I'll just lay in my shit and piss.\n\n2:22:40.280 --> 2:22:44.760\n You're dying, you're like, none of it makes sense.\n\n2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:52.040\n And I feel like in retrospect,\n\n2:22:52.040 --> 2:22:55.900\n I'm making what I've done a little,\n\n2:22:55.900 --> 2:22:57.360\n like I had more lucidity.\n\n2:22:57.360 --> 2:23:02.360\n It was more of like when you're wrestling with someone\n\n2:23:02.880 --> 2:23:06.920\n and you're just like, it's different for you.\n\n2:23:06.920 --> 2:23:08.080\n But for me, if I'm wrestling,\n\n2:23:08.080 --> 2:23:10.000\n I'm not thinking about jujitsu moves.\n\n2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:10.840\n I'm like.\n\n2:23:10.840 --> 2:23:11.680\n Survival.\n\n2:23:11.680 --> 2:23:12.500\n You're just.\n\n2:23:12.500 --> 2:23:13.340\n So it's like that.\n\n2:23:13.340 --> 2:23:14.960\n It is a struggle.\n\n2:23:14.960 --> 2:23:19.960\n Like it's like, you really have to deliberately fight.\n\n2:23:20.580 --> 2:23:21.420\n Everything.\n\n2:23:21.420 --> 2:23:25.760\n So you start, so you can almost have a conversation\n\n2:23:25.760 --> 2:23:27.560\n with the depression.\n\n2:23:27.560 --> 2:23:30.880\n And then what you do is you start doing the opposite\n\n2:23:30.880 --> 2:23:33.260\n of everything it's telling you to do.\n\n2:23:33.260 --> 2:23:36.620\n So it's telling you lay in bed.\n\n2:23:36.620 --> 2:23:38.300\n So you get out of bed.\n\n2:23:38.300 --> 2:23:41.760\n It's definitely telling you don't fucking exercise.\n\n2:23:41.760 --> 2:23:43.160\n You're gonna go fucking exercise.\n\n2:23:43.160 --> 2:23:44.200\n That's not gonna do anything.\n\n2:23:44.200 --> 2:23:45.040\n You can't.\n\n2:23:45.040 --> 2:23:46.440\n You probably have a heart attack.\n\n2:23:46.440 --> 2:23:48.080\n You really wanna go outside.\n\n2:23:48.080 --> 2:23:50.680\n Don't go fucking exercise.\n\n2:23:50.680 --> 2:23:53.360\n And it'll feel crazy.\n\n2:23:53.360 --> 2:23:54.860\n And you won't wanna do it.\n\n2:23:54.860 --> 2:23:57.380\n If you wanted to do it, you wouldn't be depressed.\n\n2:23:57.380 --> 2:23:58.480\n Like how often do you hear\n\n2:23:58.480 --> 2:24:00.400\n like one of the symptoms of depression?\n\n2:24:00.400 --> 2:24:01.560\n You wanna jog.\n\n2:24:01.560 --> 2:24:02.960\n You wanna get on a bike.\n\n2:24:02.960 --> 2:24:04.000\n You know, you don't hear that.\n\n2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:04.920\n That's not a symptom.\n\n2:24:04.920 --> 2:24:08.600\n So you start, at least one solution\n\n2:24:08.600 --> 2:24:11.920\n I just started doing the opposite of.\n\n2:24:11.920 --> 2:24:14.440\n Whatever the voice is telling you, do the opposite.\n\n2:24:14.440 --> 2:24:15.280\n That.\n\n2:24:15.280 --> 2:24:20.280\n And then suddenly the gravitational field\n\n2:24:21.240 --> 2:24:22.280\n diminishes a little bit.\n\n2:24:22.280 --> 2:24:23.560\n It doesn't go all the way away.\n\n2:24:23.560 --> 2:24:25.600\n And that's where you can fall right back into it\n\n2:24:25.600 --> 2:24:27.600\n cause you just feel even slightly better.\n\n2:24:27.600 --> 2:24:29.720\n You're like, oh, okay, I fixed it.\n\n2:24:29.720 --> 2:24:31.200\n You know, really, I think if you like\n\n2:24:31.200 --> 2:24:36.200\n and having been through therapy, the best solution\n\n2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:42.120\n would be go to a fucking therapist as quickly as you can.\n\n2:24:42.840 --> 2:24:45.720\n Just sit down with them and tell them what's going on.\n\n2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:47.760\n I know what you're thinking.\n\n2:24:47.760 --> 2:24:49.680\n How am I gonna find a therapist?\n\n2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:51.540\n Just do it.\n\n2:24:51.540 --> 2:24:53.280\n Google it, go on Yelp.\n\n2:24:53.280 --> 2:24:56.080\n All of this shit feels impossible.\n\n2:24:56.080 --> 2:24:57.480\n You're like, I don't wanna turn on the computer.\n\n2:24:57.480 --> 2:24:58.400\n I don't wanna do any of this.\n\n2:24:58.400 --> 2:24:59.240\n You just have to.\n\n2:24:59.240 --> 2:25:00.080\n I mean, you have to.\n\n2:25:00.080 --> 2:25:01.680\n You do it if you're on fire.\n\n2:25:01.680 --> 2:25:02.680\n You do it if you're on fire.\n\n2:25:02.680 --> 2:25:03.520\n And someone's like, you know,\n\n2:25:03.520 --> 2:25:05.320\n here's a way to not be on fire.\n\n2:25:05.320 --> 2:25:07.800\n Just this particular fire is,\n\n2:25:07.800 --> 2:25:09.880\n it doesn't make you wanna run around screaming.\n\n2:25:09.880 --> 2:25:11.520\n It just makes you wanna fall asleep forever.\n\n2:25:11.520 --> 2:25:15.160\n And that, but those little steps,\n\n2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:16.960\n I got lucky because it worked.\n\n2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:18.720\n It worked, I started exercising.\n\n2:25:18.720 --> 2:25:20.960\n I'd been on antidepressants before\n\n2:25:20.960 --> 2:25:23.320\n when I was originally diagnosed with it.\n\n2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:26.000\n Did those help?\n\n2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:28.880\n You know, I, even with all the current research\n\n2:25:28.880 --> 2:25:31.640\n coming out about, that maybe we were all wrong\n\n2:25:31.640 --> 2:25:33.920\n about our understanding of depression,\n\n2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:38.400\n I do feel like it helped in a certain way.\n\n2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:42.160\n Like it definitely, it definitely like\n\n2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:43.400\n made me stop thinking about,\n\n2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:45.220\n it stopped the intrusive thoughts.\n\n2:25:45.220 --> 2:25:48.160\n And, but I don't know how much of that was placebo\n\n2:25:48.160 --> 2:25:49.320\n or how much of that, I don't know.\n\n2:25:49.320 --> 2:25:51.720\n But then also like I couldn't cum anymore.\n\n2:25:51.720 --> 2:25:53.280\n That was the other fucked up thing.\n\n2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:55.640\n Like you're, you can't have orgasms.\n\n2:25:55.640 --> 2:25:58.800\n And which might not sound like a big deal,\n\n2:25:58.800 --> 2:26:02.120\n but you know, when I told my therapist\n\n2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:03.760\n that they actually took me off them,\n\n2:26:03.760 --> 2:26:05.640\n cause I think she was realizing\n\n2:26:05.640 --> 2:26:07.980\n that it started diminishing a little bit.\n\n2:26:07.980 --> 2:26:11.080\n But the one I'm talking about now,\n\n2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:14.400\n that whatever episode or whatever you wanna call it,\n\n2:26:14.400 --> 2:26:16.360\n I just got lucky cause it worked.\n\n2:26:16.360 --> 2:26:19.080\n It worked and I started feeling better, thank God.\n\n2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:22.160\n Now, if you suffer from depression out there\n\n2:26:22.160 --> 2:26:24.280\n and you've had a remission of the depression,\n\n2:26:24.280 --> 2:26:26.080\n you know, it's really like,\n\n2:26:26.080 --> 2:26:27.840\n it's scary to have mental illness\n\n2:26:27.840 --> 2:26:32.760\n because everyone gets bummed out.\n\n2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:33.920\n I mean, that's just normal.\n\n2:26:33.920 --> 2:26:35.080\n Like you're gonna get bummed out\n\n2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:36.600\n and I don't wanna do anything sometimes.\n\n2:26:36.600 --> 2:26:38.160\n It doesn't mean you have a clinical depression.\n\n2:26:38.160 --> 2:26:40.220\n You might just be bummed out or grieving.\n\n2:26:40.220 --> 2:26:42.520\n You might be any number of things.\n\n2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:46.960\n But when I get really nervous,\n\n2:26:46.960 --> 2:26:49.920\n if some of those symptoms start showing up.\n\n2:26:49.920 --> 2:26:54.920\n And at one point I felt like that was happening again.\n\n2:26:54.920 --> 2:26:59.480\n And I did intramuscular ketamine therapy,\n\n2:26:59.480 --> 2:27:02.920\n which now that was the damnedest thing\n\n2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:04.080\n I've ever experienced.\n\n2:27:04.080 --> 2:27:08.080\n Aside from the fact that ketamine is immensely psychedelic.\n\n2:27:10.860 --> 2:27:14.080\n I just remember going back to the hotel\n\n2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:17.200\n after the experience with the clinician.\n\n2:27:17.200 --> 2:27:21.900\n And like, you know, it's like with depression,\n\n2:27:21.900 --> 2:27:24.700\n it's like a headache that starts coming on.\n\n2:27:24.700 --> 2:27:27.160\n But you're like, this headache might last for years.\n\n2:27:27.160 --> 2:27:28.640\n It might last for six months.\n\n2:27:28.640 --> 2:27:30.840\n It might get worse and worse and worse.\n\n2:27:30.840 --> 2:27:35.840\n And so I went back to the hotel room and it was just gone.\n\n2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:38.480\n Like I just felt normal.\n\n2:27:38.480 --> 2:27:39.440\n It felt great.\n\n2:27:39.440 --> 2:27:42.560\n It was like the most remarkable thing ever.\n\n2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:45.960\n So, you know, look at the research on ketamine right now.\n\n2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:49.080\n It's like, it's not like bullshit.\n\n2:27:49.080 --> 2:27:50.560\n It's not like woo science.\n\n2:27:50.560 --> 2:27:52.240\n There's really, really good data out there\n\n2:27:52.240 --> 2:27:55.480\n showing that something like, I think it's 60%.\n\n2:27:55.480 --> 2:27:56.680\n I don't know what the percentage is,\n\n2:27:56.680 --> 2:28:01.680\n but 60% of people with an endogenous depression\n\n2:28:02.200 --> 2:28:06.480\n when they get ketamine therapy will experience remission,\n\n2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:08.320\n regardless of whether you trip out or not.\n\n2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:10.960\n It just does something that I don't know\n\n2:28:10.960 --> 2:28:11.960\n if they know what it is yet.\n\n2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:12.800\n I don't care if they do.\n\n2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:14.060\n But that one thing worked.\n\n2:28:14.060 --> 2:28:17.600\n And basically you keep fighting until something works.\n\n2:28:17.600 --> 2:28:18.440\n Exactly.\n\n2:28:18.440 --> 2:28:19.760\n It's a survival issue.\n\n2:28:19.760 --> 2:28:21.000\n And it's a survival issue.\n\n2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:24.500\n But it's just, I think because it's kind of so slow moving,\n\n2:28:24.500 --> 2:28:26.760\n you might even forget it's progressive.\n\n2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:28.320\n Or, you know, you could easily just think\n\n2:28:28.320 --> 2:28:30.880\n that you're just a kind of bummed out person.\n\n2:28:30.880 --> 2:28:34.960\n Or you start thinking that these aspects of your psychology\n\n2:28:34.960 --> 2:28:37.360\n are permanent when they don't have to be.\n\n2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:39.980\n What about other people in your life?\n\n2:28:39.980 --> 2:28:41.700\n What advice would you give to people\n\n2:28:41.700 --> 2:28:44.720\n that have loved ones who suffer from depression?\n\n2:28:44.720 --> 2:28:46.360\n What are they to do?\n\n2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:51.360\n Okay, now this is really like, man, it's really dark.\n\n2:28:54.680 --> 2:28:57.480\n Here's number one.\n\n2:28:57.480 --> 2:28:59.240\n This is what somebody told me\n\n2:28:59.240 --> 2:29:00.980\n when I lost a friend to suicide, you know?\n\n2:29:00.980 --> 2:29:02.800\n Because when you lose a friend to suicide,\n\n2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:04.600\n when you lose a loved one to suicide,\n\n2:29:04.600 --> 2:29:05.760\n you're gonna blame yourself.\n\n2:29:05.760 --> 2:29:10.760\n It's like in the periphery of suicide,\n\n2:29:10.920 --> 2:29:14.480\n there is a circumference of guilty people\n\n2:29:14.480 --> 2:29:17.240\n who all feel like, oh, if only I'd said this\n\n2:29:17.240 --> 2:29:19.600\n at the right time, if only I'd listened more,\n\n2:29:19.600 --> 2:29:22.160\n if only I'd seen that warning sign,\n\n2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:23.520\n if only this or that.\n\n2:29:25.080 --> 2:29:30.080\n It's interesting in that with other forms of like disease,\n\n2:29:31.820 --> 2:29:36.820\n you know, if your loved one dies from cancer, say,\n\n2:29:37.160 --> 2:29:39.600\n more than likely, you're not gonna be thinking like,\n\n2:29:39.600 --> 2:29:41.440\n oh, I should have cured their cancer.\n\n2:29:41.440 --> 2:29:43.440\n You know, like it's a tragedy,\n\n2:29:43.440 --> 2:29:46.120\n but at least you're not like, oh, if only I had.\n\n2:29:46.120 --> 2:29:48.480\n You still might think that's part of grief, but.\n\n2:29:49.560 --> 2:29:52.120\n It's not as sticky in many of the other situations.\n\n2:29:52.120 --> 2:29:55.360\n Here, the guilt couldn't really stay for a long time.\n\n2:29:55.360 --> 2:30:00.360\n Yep, so you, number one, we're talking about\n\n2:30:02.320 --> 2:30:05.360\n a progressive disease that can lead to death.\n\n2:30:05.360 --> 2:30:07.920\n And if somebody commits suicide,\n\n2:30:07.920 --> 2:30:09.420\n they wanted to commit suicide.\n\n2:30:09.420 --> 2:30:12.920\n And at least what I've been told is you can't stop it.\n\n2:30:12.920 --> 2:30:15.840\n It's gonna happen, it's gonna happen.\n\n2:30:15.840 --> 2:30:16.840\n There are no magic words.\n\n2:30:16.840 --> 2:30:18.240\n There's nothing you could do.\n\n2:30:18.240 --> 2:30:21.520\n So, you know, people who've lost people to suicide,\n\n2:30:21.520 --> 2:30:23.000\n you know what I'm talking about.\n\n2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:26.320\n Like, you know, you can watch it happen in real time\n\n2:30:26.320 --> 2:30:28.280\n and there's just nothing you could do.\n\n2:30:29.760 --> 2:30:34.140\n That being said, you know, being responsive\n\n2:30:34.140 --> 2:30:36.120\n to when it seems like someone's really reaching out\n\n2:30:36.120 --> 2:30:40.840\n for help and knowing that maybe even though it might,\n\n2:30:40.840 --> 2:30:42.960\n especially if it's someone who's like, doesn't talk\n\n2:30:42.960 --> 2:30:44.760\n like this a lot of the time,\n\n2:30:44.760 --> 2:30:47.160\n and sentences start coming out of their mouth,\n\n2:30:47.160 --> 2:30:49.480\n that if you weren't really paying attention,\n\n2:30:49.480 --> 2:30:50.960\n might not seem like a big deal,\n\n2:30:50.960 --> 2:30:52.920\n but for this person, it's kind of anomalous\n\n2:30:52.920 --> 2:30:56.480\n that all of a sudden that's happening.\n\n2:30:56.480 --> 2:30:59.560\n Now there, that's when you can be a good listener\n\n2:30:59.560 --> 2:31:01.960\n and, you know, open up to them and hear what they're saying\n\n2:31:01.960 --> 2:31:04.160\n and see like, oh, shit, are they asking me for it?\n\n2:31:04.160 --> 2:31:05.800\n Is this them asking for help?\n\n2:31:05.800 --> 2:31:08.720\n And even if you're like, I don't know what to do,\n\n2:31:08.720 --> 2:31:13.720\n you know, at least you can like start checking in on them,\n\n2:31:14.060 --> 2:31:16.640\n you know, start like help them understand\n\n2:31:16.640 --> 2:31:17.960\n that you're there for them\n\n2:31:17.960 --> 2:31:19.680\n and then hopefully get them into therapy,\n\n2:31:19.680 --> 2:31:22.720\n get them to a doctor, get them to a professional\n\n2:31:22.720 --> 2:31:25.080\n who can like see what's going on there.\n\n2:31:25.080 --> 2:31:27.040\n So that, and then there's hope.\n\n2:31:27.040 --> 2:31:28.720\n And even then there might not be hope actually,\n\n2:31:28.720 --> 2:31:30.240\n you know, doctors can't stop it.\n\n2:31:30.240 --> 2:31:34.540\n There's no, sometimes it just, that's the way it goes.\n\n2:31:34.540 --> 2:31:39.120\n But, you know, I know that like being sensitive,\n\n2:31:39.120 --> 2:31:41.460\n if somebody's like all of a sudden hitting you up\n\n2:31:41.460 --> 2:31:44.320\n or reaching out to you that normally isn't like that\n\n2:31:44.320 --> 2:31:46.060\n and just, what's going on?\n\n2:31:46.060 --> 2:31:46.900\n How are you?\n\n2:31:46.900 --> 2:31:48.040\n And just listen.\n\n2:31:48.040 --> 2:31:50.600\n Which in general, depression or not,\n\n2:31:50.600 --> 2:31:52.960\n is probably a good thing to do.\n\n2:31:52.960 --> 2:31:53.780\n Yeah.\n\n2:31:53.780 --> 2:31:56.560\n To truly listen.\n\n2:31:56.560 --> 2:31:57.760\n It's like, are you okay?\n\n2:31:57.760 --> 2:31:59.480\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:31:59.480 --> 2:32:01.000\n Because people have, you know,\n\n2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:03.720\n this whole thing of like cries for help, man.\n\n2:32:03.720 --> 2:32:06.560\n Sometimes they just look like a weird text.\n\n2:32:06.560 --> 2:32:08.240\n You know, and you don't realize\n\n2:32:08.240 --> 2:32:10.000\n for the person to send that fucking text,\n\n2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:12.100\n they've been thinking about it all morning.\n\n2:32:12.100 --> 2:32:14.920\n They've been just trying to get their phone up\n\n2:32:14.920 --> 2:32:16.440\n from the floor.\n\n2:32:16.440 --> 2:32:20.040\n So, you know, I think that's it.\n\n2:32:20.040 --> 2:32:21.800\n I mean, what, I don't know.\n\n2:32:21.800 --> 2:32:22.760\n I don't know.\n\n2:32:22.760 --> 2:32:25.920\n I've had friends like kill themselves.\n\n2:32:25.920 --> 2:32:29.120\n And many of them, it wasn't like,\n\n2:32:29.120 --> 2:32:31.360\n sadly it was like, I don't know.\n\n2:32:31.360 --> 2:32:32.440\n I don't know what could have been done,\n\n2:32:32.440 --> 2:32:34.000\n but.\n\n2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:37.760\n But there's still a guilt in the back of your head?\n\n2:32:37.760 --> 2:32:39.240\n For the rest of my life, for sure.\n\n2:32:39.240 --> 2:32:40.220\n I always will be.\n\n2:32:41.940 --> 2:32:43.080\n Yeah, I mean, yeah.\n\n2:32:43.080 --> 2:32:44.680\n But again, what are you gonna do?\n\n2:32:44.680 --> 2:32:46.720\n But even that, it's a part of love.\n\n2:32:48.800 --> 2:32:49.800\n That's right.\n\n2:32:49.800 --> 2:32:50.760\n That's right.\n\n2:32:50.760 --> 2:32:51.600\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n2:32:51.600 --> 2:32:52.440\n You could, yeah.\n\n2:32:52.440 --> 2:32:54.040\n You know, we feel guilt.\n\n2:32:54.040 --> 2:32:55.800\n Part of grief is guilt, you know?\n\n2:32:55.800 --> 2:32:58.480\n Like we always could have been better people.\n\n2:32:58.480 --> 2:33:00.360\n We always could have been better people.\n\n2:33:00.360 --> 2:33:02.200\n You getting to Viktor Frankl much?\n\n2:33:02.200 --> 2:33:03.200\n Yeah, of course.\n\n2:33:03.200 --> 2:33:04.520\n Man's search for meaning.\n\n2:33:05.860 --> 2:33:10.860\n The invitation to live your life\n\n2:33:11.320 --> 2:33:13.520\n as though you'd been on your death bed\n\n2:33:13.520 --> 2:33:15.560\n and had been given the chance to go back\n\n2:33:15.560 --> 2:33:18.000\n and not make the same mistakes.\n\n2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:20.760\n I return to that idea all the time,\n\n2:33:20.760 --> 2:33:22.400\n meaning it's like, okay,\n\n2:33:22.400 --> 2:33:27.400\n whatever you did before this moment was too late.\n\n2:33:28.160 --> 2:33:31.120\n But now, you know, this is where you can start.\n\n2:33:31.120 --> 2:33:32.400\n This is where you can start.\n\n2:33:32.400 --> 2:33:37.400\n And yeah, so I think that for a neurotic like me,\n\n2:33:38.160 --> 2:33:39.120\n that's super important.\n\n2:33:39.120 --> 2:33:41.380\n Because otherwise, I'll just get like too lost\n\n2:33:41.380 --> 2:33:44.600\n in the weeds of shitty things I did in the past.\n\n2:33:44.600 --> 2:33:46.080\n So speaking of Viktor Frankl,\n\n2:33:46.080 --> 2:33:48.400\n you and Hitler have the same birthday.\n\n2:33:48.400 --> 2:33:50.680\n Oh my God, you've really done your research.\n\n2:33:52.240 --> 2:33:55.680\n Well, I often Google famous people\n\n2:33:55.680 --> 2:33:58.720\n that have a birthday same as Hitler.\n\n2:33:58.720 --> 2:33:59.560\n Yeah.\n\n2:33:59.560 --> 2:34:02.120\n The person that shows up, you know,\n\n2:34:02.120 --> 2:34:04.640\n is your face just really big.\n\n2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:08.000\n You and Hitler together, just pals next to each other.\n\n2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:10.000\n No, it does not.\n\n2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:12.920\n No, but April 20th is an embarrassing birthday\n\n2:34:12.920 --> 2:34:14.600\n for all my 420 friends out there.\n\n2:34:14.600 --> 2:34:15.440\n It's embarrassing.\n\n2:34:15.440 --> 2:34:17.520\n You share a birthday with Hitler.\n\n2:34:17.520 --> 2:34:20.240\n Well, it's 420s also has a humor\n\n2:34:20.240 --> 2:34:23.100\n and a lightness to it, right?\n\n2:34:23.100 --> 2:34:24.320\n It's embarrassing.\n\n2:34:24.320 --> 2:34:27.240\n Your life is embarrassing.\n\n2:34:27.240 --> 2:34:31.080\n But if you like weed and you're born on stoner day\n\n2:34:31.080 --> 2:34:34.120\n and you believe in reincarnation,\n\n2:34:34.120 --> 2:34:36.520\n do you realize like when you start connecting the dots there,\n\n2:34:36.520 --> 2:34:39.720\n if there is like a Bardo where you get to choose\n\n2:34:39.720 --> 2:34:41.040\n your next life.\n\n2:34:41.040 --> 2:34:45.040\n So you're like a shitty generic NPC.\n\n2:34:45.040 --> 2:34:48.800\n You're like, of course, you would be born on 420.\n\n2:34:48.800 --> 2:34:53.800\n Dude, let me be born on 420, man, yeah.\n\n2:34:53.800 --> 2:34:57.040\n But isn't it interesting that on that same day,\n\n2:34:57.040 --> 2:34:58.580\n Hitler is also born.\n\n2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:05.080\n There's a tension to that and that Hitler's an artist.\n\n2:35:06.760 --> 2:35:11.760\n So it's like that hippie mindset could go anywhere.\n\n2:35:12.080 --> 2:35:12.920\n Oh, yeah, right.\n\n2:35:12.920 --> 2:35:14.080\n Like, yeah, you know,\n\n2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:15.960\n and I was just having this conversation\n\n2:35:15.960 --> 2:35:18.860\n with a friend of mine who's a wonderful skeptic.\n\n2:35:18.860 --> 2:35:22.200\n And we were talking about this,\n\n2:35:22.200 --> 2:35:27.200\n which is the thing where you start attributing to the day\n\n2:35:28.360 --> 2:35:31.080\n you were born, these kinds of significance.\n\n2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:33.320\n And based on maybe people who were born on that day,\n\n2:35:33.320 --> 2:35:34.960\n maybe some other things.\n\n2:35:34.960 --> 2:35:38.040\n And, you know, it's like, think of how many people by now\n\n2:35:38.040 --> 2:35:42.360\n in the course of human history have been born on April 20th.\n\n2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:44.160\n I mean, how many?\n\n2:35:44.160 --> 2:35:45.440\n Someone could probably do the math\n\n2:35:45.440 --> 2:35:47.920\n and come up with some number close to it.\n\n2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:51.880\n Now, this is how you know how rotten Hitler is.\n\n2:35:51.880 --> 2:35:53.600\n Like, he's the one that, like,\n\n2:35:53.600 --> 2:35:56.840\n fucks up the birthday for everybody else.\n\n2:35:56.840 --> 2:35:57.920\n But.\n\n2:35:57.920 --> 2:36:02.920\n I think where I heard that you're 420 is Wim Hof episode\n\n2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:04.880\n because he's also 420.\n\n2:36:04.880 --> 2:36:05.880\n He's a 420.\n\n2:36:05.880 --> 2:36:09.820\n Yeah, so Hitler beats even Wim Hof.\n\n2:36:09.820 --> 2:36:10.660\n Look.\n\n2:36:10.660 --> 2:36:11.960\n In terms of owning the date.\n\n2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:15.040\n I think if anybody is like,\n\n2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:18.720\n well, obviously there's nothing you can do to like fix it.\n\n2:36:18.720 --> 2:36:20.400\n Hitler fucked up a lot of things.\n\n2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:22.080\n He fucked up that mustache.\n\n2:36:22.080 --> 2:36:23.720\n He fucked up the name Hitler.\n\n2:36:23.720 --> 2:36:25.180\n He fucked up 420.\n\n2:36:25.180 --> 2:36:29.080\n And obviously he caused a horrific Holocaust that,\n\n2:36:29.080 --> 2:36:32.040\n by the way, talk about these reverberations through time\n\n2:36:32.040 --> 2:36:33.200\n that we're still experiencing.\n\n2:36:33.200 --> 2:36:34.280\n I mean, there's still people walking around\n\n2:36:34.280 --> 2:36:36.620\n with fucking tattoos from that motherfucker.\n\n2:36:36.620 --> 2:36:41.400\n So, but, you know, Wim Hof, you know, people like Wim Hof.\n\n2:36:41.400 --> 2:36:45.920\n They're like whatever the opposite of Hitler is, you know?\n\n2:36:45.920 --> 2:36:47.880\n He too is creating ripples in the lake\n\n2:36:47.880 --> 2:36:51.280\n that hopefully respond to that of Hitler.\n\n2:36:51.280 --> 2:36:53.200\n Yeah, very cold fucking lake.\n\n2:36:53.200 --> 2:36:57.560\n And he's in, and yeah, so very, very cold lake\n\n2:36:57.560 --> 2:36:59.920\n that he's happily swimming around in.\n\n2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:04.920\n But yeah, you know, I try not to think about\n\n2:37:05.240 --> 2:37:08.240\n like the Hitler thing on my birthday.\n\n2:37:08.240 --> 2:37:11.120\n Then my dad would just, every birthday he would remind me\n\n2:37:11.120 --> 2:37:12.120\n that Hitler was 420.\n\n2:37:12.120 --> 2:37:14.800\n Do you think all of us are capable of evil?\n\n2:37:14.800 --> 2:37:18.240\n Do you think, you're one of the sweetest people I know,\n\n2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:21.000\n just as a fan, do you think you're capable of evil?\n\n2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:24.520\n Sure, yeah, I mean, sure, definitely.\n\n2:37:24.520 --> 2:37:27.900\n I think if you don't think that, you better watch out\n\n2:37:27.900 --> 2:37:31.540\n because come on, how do you think you're not capable of evil?\n\n2:37:31.540 --> 2:37:34.280\n And PS, you are, if you're connected\n\n2:37:34.280 --> 2:37:38.420\n to the supply chain, friend, you're doing evil.\n\n2:37:38.420 --> 2:37:39.920\n You're paying taxes.\n\n2:37:39.920 --> 2:37:43.680\n You're like, you're supporting the worst things in the world.\n\n2:37:43.680 --> 2:37:47.520\n I mean, you know, like diffusion of responsibility,\n\n2:37:47.520 --> 2:37:51.480\n it's really curious or the circumference of responsibility\n\n2:37:51.480 --> 2:37:54.280\n where it's like bombs are going off somewhere\n\n2:37:54.280 --> 2:37:59.280\n that were paid for in some small part by you,\n\n2:38:00.920 --> 2:38:05.920\n some fractional, if an American, if a drone is flying over\n\n2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:10.560\n a village in Afghanistan and drops a bomb\n\n2:38:10.560 --> 2:38:14.040\n and you pay taxes, then you could say you have\n\n2:38:14.040 --> 2:38:18.800\n fractional ownership over that drone.\n\n2:38:18.800 --> 2:38:22.080\n You're a cog in the machine of evil in some sense.\n\n2:38:22.080 --> 2:38:24.400\n And I know what you're gonna say,\n\n2:38:24.400 --> 2:38:26.400\n well, yeah, but I have to fucking pay taxes.\n\n2:38:26.400 --> 2:38:27.320\n Like I have no choice.\n\n2:38:27.320 --> 2:38:29.760\n There's sales tax, there's this or that.\n\n2:38:29.760 --> 2:38:31.940\n Take that attitude.\n\n2:38:31.940 --> 2:38:34.620\n It's the same thing that people on the battlefield\n\n2:38:34.620 --> 2:38:37.580\n when they're sending missiles into other tanks,\n\n2:38:37.580 --> 2:38:39.000\n they're thinking the same thing.\n\n2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:42.280\n It's just, they're more directly responsible\n\n2:38:42.280 --> 2:38:43.240\n for what's going on.\n\n2:38:43.240 --> 2:38:48.240\n But in Buddhism, this idea of dependent co arising\n\n2:38:49.040 --> 2:38:50.600\n or yeah, dependent co arising.\n\n2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:51.440\n We're all connected.\n\n2:38:51.440 --> 2:38:53.560\n We're all part of this matrix.\n\n2:38:53.560 --> 2:38:54.580\n We're all connected,\n\n2:38:54.580 --> 2:38:57.600\n meaning we all share responsibility\n\n2:38:57.600 --> 2:38:58.680\n for the evil in the world.\n\n2:38:58.680 --> 2:39:03.380\n So even if you aren't directly committing evil acts,\n\n2:39:03.380 --> 2:39:05.640\n if you're seeing something in the world\n\n2:39:05.640 --> 2:39:08.200\n and you're thinking that's evil,\n\n2:39:08.200 --> 2:39:10.640\n you're probably not quite as separated from that\n\n2:39:10.640 --> 2:39:11.760\n as you'd like to believe\n\n2:39:11.760 --> 2:39:16.760\n in some tiny infinitesimally quantum way, you're connected.\n\n2:39:19.240 --> 2:39:23.160\n And there is a sense, I've gotten to experience this\n\n2:39:23.160 --> 2:39:25.200\n over and over that one individual\n\n2:39:25.200 --> 2:39:28.200\n can actually make a gigantic difference.\n\n2:39:28.200 --> 2:39:33.200\n And so not only is there a diffusion responsibility,\n\n2:39:33.380 --> 2:39:37.320\n there's a kind of a paralysis about, well, what can I do?\n\n2:39:37.320 --> 2:39:38.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:39:38.480 --> 2:39:40.920\n Sure, I understand, but what can I do?\n\n2:39:40.920 --> 2:39:44.980\n And I think just looking at history\n\n2:39:46.120 --> 2:39:50.040\n and also hanging out and becoming friends,\n\n2:39:50.040 --> 2:39:51.520\n but also interviewing people\n\n2:39:51.520 --> 2:39:52.940\n that have had a tremendous impact,\n\n2:39:52.940 --> 2:39:55.520\n you realize you're just one dude.\n\n2:39:55.520 --> 2:39:56.340\n Yeah.\n\n2:39:56.340 --> 2:39:58.640\n You're like a normal person.\n\n2:39:58.640 --> 2:40:00.360\n You're not that smart even.\n\n2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:04.280\n Like a lot of people aren't like in some kind of magical way\n\n2:40:04.280 --> 2:40:07.280\n where you have a big head that's figuring out everything.\n\n2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:12.080\n No, you just saw problems in the world\n\n2:40:12.080 --> 2:40:13.200\n and you're like, hey,\n\n2:40:13.200 --> 2:40:15.200\n I think I'm gonna try to do something about this.\n\n2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:16.040\n Yeah.\n\n2:40:16.040 --> 2:40:17.320\n And you stay focused and dedicated to it\n\n2:40:17.320 --> 2:40:21.040\n for a prolonged period of time and refuse to quit,\n\n2:40:21.040 --> 2:40:23.040\n refuse to listen to people that tell you\n\n2:40:23.040 --> 2:40:24.760\n that this isn't like impossible,\n\n2:40:24.760 --> 2:40:26.280\n here's how others have failed.\n\n2:40:26.280 --> 2:40:27.120\n Yeah.\n\n2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:29.080\n No, I'm gonna do it.\n\n2:40:29.080 --> 2:40:30.260\n That's it.\n\n2:40:30.260 --> 2:40:31.100\n That's it.\n\n2:40:31.100 --> 2:40:32.640\n And one person, and then you kind of,\n\n2:40:32.640 --> 2:40:34.600\n the thing is when there's one person\n\n2:40:34.600 --> 2:40:36.620\n that keeps pushing forward that way,\n\n2:40:36.620 --> 2:40:38.000\n there's, humans are sticky.\n\n2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:40.280\n They, other people follow them around\n\n2:40:40.280 --> 2:40:42.320\n and they're like, I'll help.\n\n2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:45.480\n You know, I'll help and then the other people help\n\n2:40:45.480 --> 2:40:47.740\n and then the cool people all gather together\n\n2:40:47.740 --> 2:40:49.800\n cause they kind of get excited about this way.\n\n2:40:49.800 --> 2:40:52.080\n Holy shit, we can actually make a difference.\n\n2:40:52.080 --> 2:40:53.720\n And they, they form groups\n\n2:40:53.720 --> 2:40:56.040\n and then all of a sudden there's companies and nations\n\n2:40:56.040 --> 2:40:58.240\n that actually make a gigantic difference.\n\n2:40:58.240 --> 2:40:59.080\n It's interesting.\n\n2:40:59.080 --> 2:41:01.840\n And it all starts with one person often.\n\n2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:02.680\n You know what?\n\n2:41:02.680 --> 2:41:04.620\n If I could push back slightly against that,\n\n2:41:04.620 --> 2:41:06.040\n it's never just one person.\n\n2:41:06.040 --> 2:41:09.920\n It's like, you know, nobody ever talks about,\n\n2:41:09.920 --> 2:41:11.320\n at least as far as I'm aware,\n\n2:41:11.320 --> 2:41:14.620\n you never hear about like Buddha's great grandmother.\n\n2:41:14.620 --> 2:41:15.800\n You never hear about that.\n\n2:41:15.800 --> 2:41:16.720\n You never hear about that.\n\n2:41:16.720 --> 2:41:20.520\n But if not for that person, no Buddhism.\n\n2:41:20.520 --> 2:41:23.520\n You know, the people you're talking about,\n\n2:41:23.520 --> 2:41:26.240\n they are the tip of the iceberg\n\n2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:29.400\n that pops up out of the ocean of history.\n\n2:41:29.400 --> 2:41:34.280\n And you never see that all the little things\n\n2:41:34.280 --> 2:41:36.440\n that helped that happen.\n\n2:41:36.440 --> 2:41:39.800\n And so to me, this is where the real,\n\n2:41:39.800 --> 2:41:41.300\n like how do you help?\n\n2:41:41.300 --> 2:41:42.940\n What's something you can do?\n\n2:41:42.940 --> 2:41:45.880\n Well, you know, recognize that first,\n\n2:41:45.880 --> 2:41:47.280\n that you don't really, you don't,\n\n2:41:47.280 --> 2:41:48.560\n you might not even be aware\n\n2:41:48.560 --> 2:41:51.000\n of how much you're impacting people around you.\n\n2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:53.280\n You might think that you're not,\n\n2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:55.600\n or you might think surely not in a way\n\n2:41:55.600 --> 2:41:57.380\n that makes a big difference,\n\n2:41:57.380 --> 2:42:01.080\n but you have no idea these tipping points\n\n2:42:01.080 --> 2:42:06.080\n and they can lead to the emergence of an Einstein,\n\n2:42:06.120 --> 2:42:08.760\n a Gandhi, a Martin Luther King.\n\n2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:11.800\n We can go on and on, a Dostoevsky or whoever.\n\n2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:14.160\n And so I think that's where for me,\n\n2:42:14.160 --> 2:42:16.680\n it goes back to tend to the part of the garden\n\n2:42:16.680 --> 2:42:21.680\n you can touch and then, or even deeper than that intention.\n\n2:42:22.520 --> 2:42:24.720\n It was just like an, I'm an idiot.\n\n2:42:24.720 --> 2:42:28.760\n So I need an idiot's intention, which is don't,\n\n2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:31.260\n if you, I heard the Dalai Lama say it.\n\n2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:36.020\n If you can help, help.\n\n2:42:36.020 --> 2:42:38.700\n If you can't help, don't hurt.\n\n2:42:38.700 --> 2:42:43.280\n Simple, basic dummy rules so that you can,\n\n2:42:43.280 --> 2:42:46.520\n if possible, refrain from hurting,\n\n2:42:46.520 --> 2:42:49.440\n which might as well be a form of helping.\n\n2:42:50.520 --> 2:42:53.420\n And the help doesn't have to be this dramatic thing.\n\n2:42:53.420 --> 2:42:56.060\n These little acts of kindness.\n\n2:42:56.060 --> 2:42:59.580\n I don't know, they seem to have,\n\n2:42:59.580 --> 2:43:01.300\n maybe I believe in kind of karma,\n\n2:43:01.300 --> 2:43:03.040\n but they seem to have this,\n\n2:43:03.040 --> 2:43:05.740\n they can have this gigantic ripple effect.\n\n2:43:05.740 --> 2:43:07.980\n I don't know why that is.\n\n2:43:07.980 --> 2:43:11.740\n I just, I remember a lot of little acts of kindness\n\n2:43:11.740 --> 2:43:15.700\n that people have done to me and they, what do they do?\n\n2:43:16.940 --> 2:43:19.260\n One, they fill me with joy and hope for the future.\n\n2:43:19.260 --> 2:43:21.220\n They give me faith in humanity.\n\n2:43:21.220 --> 2:43:26.220\n That somehow there's a partially dormant desire\n\n2:43:29.700 --> 2:43:31.780\n in our sort of collective intelligence\n\n2:43:31.780 --> 2:43:33.420\n to do good in the world.\n\n2:43:33.420 --> 2:43:36.240\n That most of us want to be good,\n\n2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:38.460\n that want to do good onto the world.\n\n2:43:38.460 --> 2:43:41.500\n I want, there's a kindness that's kind of like\n\n2:43:41.500 --> 2:43:43.820\n begging to get out, you know?\n\n2:43:43.820 --> 2:43:46.060\n And those little acts of kindness do just that.\n\n2:43:46.060 --> 2:43:48.580\n And actually one of the reasons I love Austin\n\n2:43:48.580 --> 2:43:52.100\n and moved here is realizing,\n\n2:43:52.100 --> 2:43:55.380\n just noticing those little acts of kindness all around me,\n\n2:43:55.380 --> 2:43:58.900\n just for stupid reasons, just people being really nice.\n\n2:43:58.900 --> 2:44:03.900\n It's weird and that kindness combined with an optimism\n\n2:44:04.260 --> 2:44:09.260\n for the future, it's just, it's amazing what that can build.\n\n2:44:09.460 --> 2:44:12.160\n Yes, yes, it's incredible.\n\n2:44:12.160 --> 2:44:13.200\n And I know what you're saying.\n\n2:44:13.200 --> 2:44:17.180\n It's like, you know, we moved to this great neighborhood\n\n2:44:17.180 --> 2:44:21.900\n and at this point I think three,\n\n2:44:21.900 --> 2:44:25.540\n maybe four of our neighbors have like made food for us\n\n2:44:25.540 --> 2:44:29.260\n that just shows up with like handwritten lists\n\n2:44:29.260 --> 2:44:31.740\n of like things they like to do in the area\n\n2:44:31.740 --> 2:44:34.140\n and their phone number if we need help.\n\n2:44:34.140 --> 2:44:36.700\n And it's like, holy shit.\n\n2:44:36.700 --> 2:44:40.280\n That's like, it might seem like a little act,\n\n2:44:40.280 --> 2:44:43.380\n but it feels like some kind of atomic love bomb\n\n2:44:43.380 --> 2:44:46.060\n just went off on your porch when you're looking at that.\n\n2:44:46.060 --> 2:44:48.100\n I'm like, what the fuck?\n\n2:44:48.100 --> 2:44:50.740\n You made me a pie?\n\n2:44:50.740 --> 2:44:51.780\n This is incredible.\n\n2:44:51.780 --> 2:44:53.740\n Like, this is incredible, so.\n\n2:44:53.740 --> 2:44:57.740\n And also it's another act to accept that kindness.\n\n2:44:57.740 --> 2:45:01.080\n It's like a lot of times when I was like in Boston\n\n2:45:01.080 --> 2:45:03.740\n or San Francisco, certain big cities,\n\n2:45:03.740 --> 2:45:05.020\n you can think like, oh, okay,\n\n2:45:05.020 --> 2:45:07.040\n well they're trying to like somehow,\n\n2:45:08.780 --> 2:45:10.080\n that's not an act of kindness.\n\n2:45:10.080 --> 2:45:12.860\n That's some kind of a transactional thing to build up.\n\n2:45:12.860 --> 2:45:15.140\n It's like a career move for networking,\n\n2:45:15.140 --> 2:45:16.300\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:45:16.300 --> 2:45:18.220\n But no, if you just accept it for what it is,\n\n2:45:18.220 --> 2:45:20.140\n a pure act of kindness.\n\n2:45:20.140 --> 2:45:21.460\n Fucking Boston.\n\n2:45:21.460 --> 2:45:22.860\n It's the, yeah.\n\n2:45:22.860 --> 2:45:25.060\n Because for me, I go the opposite route.\n\n2:45:25.060 --> 2:45:26.600\n Because I'm not, even though there is a part of me\n\n2:45:26.600 --> 2:45:29.180\n that might be a little suspicious or something,\n\n2:45:29.180 --> 2:45:33.000\n where I go to push that shit back mentally\n\n2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:34.860\n is I'm like, I don't deserve this.\n\n2:45:34.860 --> 2:45:37.520\n If they knew what a piece of shit I am.\n\n2:45:37.520 --> 2:45:38.360\n You're gonna bring me,\n\n2:45:38.360 --> 2:45:40.500\n I don't wanna never bring cakes to my neighbors.\n\n2:45:40.500 --> 2:45:41.740\n I wouldn't know how to make a cake.\n\n2:45:41.740 --> 2:45:42.780\n I don't know how to make anything.\n\n2:45:42.780 --> 2:45:43.820\n I don't have time.\n\n2:45:43.820 --> 2:45:45.380\n I should be bringing shit to my neighbors.\n\n2:45:45.380 --> 2:45:46.300\n Why didn't I do that?\n\n2:45:46.300 --> 2:45:48.900\n I should have brought, I never do that.\n\n2:45:48.900 --> 2:45:50.500\n If you're not careful,\n\n2:45:50.500 --> 2:45:54.580\n you can spiral into a vortex of self hate from the gift.\n\n2:45:54.580 --> 2:45:56.300\n So you have to, yeah, you have to learn how to,\n\n2:45:56.300 --> 2:46:01.020\n in that circuitry, you have to learn how to like accept.\n\n2:46:01.020 --> 2:46:03.020\n Oh yeah, I have that problem really big.\n\n2:46:03.020 --> 2:46:05.660\n Yeah, like I don't deserve this.\n\n2:46:06.940 --> 2:46:10.300\n Like I don't, I get so much love from people.\n\n2:46:10.300 --> 2:46:11.860\n I'm like, well, yeah, they love me\n\n2:46:11.860 --> 2:46:13.400\n because they don't know me.\n\n2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:15.260\n That's my brain, my little voice.\n\n2:46:15.260 --> 2:46:19.140\n Like you're not, you're not worthy.\n\n2:46:19.980 --> 2:46:23.900\n You're not worthy of any of this kindness\n\n2:46:23.900 --> 2:46:24.860\n and all this kind of stuff.\n\n2:46:24.860 --> 2:46:28.500\n And that could be very, yeah, it can shut you down.\n\n2:46:28.500 --> 2:46:30.140\n It can be debilitating.\n\n2:46:30.140 --> 2:46:32.100\n And also it shuts the person down.\n\n2:46:32.100 --> 2:46:32.940\n I mean, you're talking.\n\n2:46:32.940 --> 2:46:36.140\n And that's the dark side is it pushes them away too.\n\n2:46:36.140 --> 2:46:40.020\n Yeah, it cuts off this fucking mystical circuitry.\n\n2:46:40.020 --> 2:46:43.460\n So like the best thing if that happens to you\n\n2:46:43.460 --> 2:46:46.300\n is like accept it joyfully.\n\n2:46:46.300 --> 2:46:48.140\n And just even, just all that,\n\n2:46:48.140 --> 2:46:50.340\n whatever that thing inside of you,\n\n2:46:50.340 --> 2:46:52.660\n whatever that little thing is, you know,\n\n2:46:52.660 --> 2:46:56.100\n this is like in the meditation I do,\n\n2:46:56.100 --> 2:46:58.240\n it's an infuriatingly simple meditation,\n\n2:46:58.240 --> 2:47:01.660\n but when a thought emerges,\n\n2:47:01.660 --> 2:47:03.940\n when you are resting your attention on your breath\n\n2:47:03.940 --> 2:47:07.300\n and then inevitably you think, you get lost in your thoughts.\n\n2:47:07.300 --> 2:47:09.340\n And when you catch yourself doing that,\n\n2:47:09.340 --> 2:47:11.740\n you think thinking,\n\n2:47:11.740 --> 2:47:13.500\n and then return your attention to the breath.\n\n2:47:13.500 --> 2:47:17.060\n So I like that so that when that part of myself starts,\n\n2:47:17.060 --> 2:47:20.140\n you know, having its little neurotic semi seizure,\n\n2:47:20.140 --> 2:47:22.340\n I can just go thinking, whatever.\n\n2:47:22.340 --> 2:47:23.460\n It's just another thought.\n\n2:47:23.460 --> 2:47:26.980\n And then eat the, eat the, eat the banana bread\n\n2:47:26.980 --> 2:47:28.700\n or whatever they gave you.\n\n2:47:28.700 --> 2:47:31.780\n What's the most wild psychedelic experience\n\n2:47:31.780 --> 2:47:34.540\n you've ever had in a dream, in a vision?\n\n2:47:34.540 --> 2:47:36.700\n It doesn't have to be drug related.\n\n2:47:36.700 --> 2:47:40.020\n What's one that jumps to mind\n\n2:47:40.020 --> 2:47:42.740\n that was like, holy shit, I'm happy to be alive.\n\n2:47:42.740 --> 2:47:43.820\n Is this life?\n\n2:47:43.820 --> 2:47:45.220\n Okay. This is amazing.\n\n2:47:45.220 --> 2:47:46.900\n Yeah, the, oh yeah, okay.\n\n2:47:46.900 --> 2:47:51.580\n So the one that pops to mind,\n\n2:47:51.580 --> 2:47:54.040\n I've had a lot of psychedelic experiences,\n\n2:47:54.040 --> 2:47:56.020\n but in this moment, the one that pops to mind,\n\n2:47:56.020 --> 2:47:58.760\n only because it goes back to what you're talking about,\n\n2:47:58.760 --> 2:48:01.760\n about this Nietzsche's idea of infinite return.\n\n2:48:01.760 --> 2:48:06.760\n The, the, so I'm a Burning Man and.\n\n2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:10.360\n Are you going to Burning Man this time?\n\n2:48:10.360 --> 2:48:11.200\n I'm not.\n\n2:48:11.200 --> 2:48:12.560\n I mean, I have kids right now.\n\n2:48:12.560 --> 2:48:13.600\n I just want to be around them.\n\n2:48:13.600 --> 2:48:15.480\n My wife was being so cool about it\n\n2:48:15.480 --> 2:48:16.720\n and she knows I love Burning Man.\n\n2:48:16.720 --> 2:48:17.800\n She's like, go to Burning Man.\n\n2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:19.120\n And I was going to go.\n\n2:48:19.120 --> 2:48:22.520\n And then I just, I just want to be around my kids\n\n2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:24.240\n as much as I can right now, but.\n\n2:48:24.240 --> 2:48:25.360\n I've never been to Burning Man.\n\n2:48:25.360 --> 2:48:29.200\n So I don't know how secretive it is that, I mean,\n\n2:48:29.200 --> 2:48:31.580\n cause quite high profile folks go.\n\n2:48:31.580 --> 2:48:34.040\n Yeah, everyone knows Elon Musk goes there.\n\n2:48:34.040 --> 2:48:35.280\n Isn't it pretty open?\n\n2:48:35.280 --> 2:48:36.180\n He's got a boat.\n\n2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:38.080\n You know that?\n\n2:48:38.080 --> 2:48:39.600\n I'm touching none of this.\n\n2:48:39.600 --> 2:48:41.280\n You know, there's a, it's called art cars.\n\n2:48:41.280 --> 2:48:42.280\n They all make art cars.\n\n2:48:42.280 --> 2:48:44.600\n And like part of the, part of the burn,\n\n2:48:44.600 --> 2:48:47.600\n what's so beautiful about it is like,\n\n2:48:47.600 --> 2:48:49.280\n you can't buy anything there, man.\n\n2:48:49.280 --> 2:48:53.680\n Like you, I've heard, I don't know if this has changed.\n\n2:48:53.680 --> 2:48:55.520\n It's been a bit because of the pandemic,\n\n2:48:55.520 --> 2:48:59.200\n but the only thing you could buy was ice and coffee.\n\n2:48:59.200 --> 2:49:01.240\n And I think maybe that's changed.\n\n2:49:01.240 --> 2:49:02.840\n I heard some whisper that that's changed,\n\n2:49:02.840 --> 2:49:07.400\n but so that means that it's a gifting economy\n\n2:49:07.400 --> 2:49:08.240\n is what they call it.\n\n2:49:08.240 --> 2:49:11.000\n And so people will just give you stuff.\n\n2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:13.560\n Talk about having to struggle with deserving stuff, man.\n\n2:49:13.560 --> 2:49:17.160\n What are you going to fucking do when the camp next to you\n\n2:49:17.160 --> 2:49:20.620\n is like every morning making the best iced coffee\n\n2:49:20.620 --> 2:49:22.200\n that you've ever had in your life.\n\n2:49:22.200 --> 2:49:25.880\n And they just are giving it all away till it's all gone.\n\n2:49:25.880 --> 2:49:27.000\n What are you going to do?\n\n2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:30.080\n It's, it's the best ever.\n\n2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:31.680\n And then you're giving things to people.\n\n2:49:31.680 --> 2:49:34.320\n And then you, you learn stuff like,\n\n2:49:34.320 --> 2:49:36.900\n you learn these really interesting lessons.\n\n2:49:36.900 --> 2:49:39.880\n Like one of the times I went there,\n\n2:49:40.960 --> 2:49:44.720\n got all these strawberries.\n\n2:49:44.720 --> 2:49:46.120\n Might not sound like a big deal,\n\n2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:48.640\n but when you're out there in the dust\n\n2:49:48.640 --> 2:49:50.080\n and you're not at one of like the,\n\n2:49:50.080 --> 2:49:52.440\n like hardcore like luxury camps,\n\n2:49:52.440 --> 2:49:53.800\n which do exist out there,\n\n2:49:55.800 --> 2:49:58.000\n you know, you've got these like items where in my mind,\n\n2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:00.440\n I'm like, yeah, these are going to be just for me\n\n2:50:00.440 --> 2:50:03.760\n and my girlfriend, my special stash fruit\n\n2:50:03.760 --> 2:50:04.960\n and this or that.\n\n2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:09.360\n And then like two days in you're walking around your camp\n\n2:50:10.280 --> 2:50:12.880\n with the strawberries that you were coveting\n\n2:50:12.880 --> 2:50:16.380\n and everyone's so happy to get like cold strawberries\n\n2:50:16.380 --> 2:50:17.920\n and you've realized, oh my God,\n\n2:50:17.920 --> 2:50:21.320\n this feels so much better than the way a strawberry tastes.\n\n2:50:21.320 --> 2:50:25.040\n So you learn something experientially there,\n\n2:50:25.040 --> 2:50:27.040\n which is an incredible thing.\n\n2:50:27.040 --> 2:50:29.080\n It's an incredible thing.\n\n2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:31.840\n Man, now I'm wishing I had decided to go to Burning Man.\n\n2:50:31.840 --> 2:50:32.880\n Have you been a few times?\n\n2:50:32.880 --> 2:50:34.820\n Yeah, I just know like,\n\n2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:39.200\n at least people were saying it was Elon Musk's boat.\n\n2:50:39.200 --> 2:50:41.040\n Like, yeah, like this, I think it was like,\n\n2:50:41.040 --> 2:50:43.560\n it's like this massive, it's art cars.\n\n2:50:43.560 --> 2:50:45.260\n And it was this party on this thing.\n\n2:50:45.260 --> 2:50:48.560\n You could just, anyone can go on the boat.\n\n2:50:48.560 --> 2:50:50.920\n Like no one's like, there's no guest list.\n\n2:50:50.920 --> 2:50:52.240\n You just go on there.\n\n2:50:52.240 --> 2:50:53.680\n I never saw him there, but that, you know,\n\n2:50:53.680 --> 2:50:56.400\n everyone's whispering Elon Musk is here.\n\n2:50:56.400 --> 2:50:58.320\n There's a secrecy, there's all that kind of stuff\n\n2:50:58.320 --> 2:50:59.720\n because you'd probably have to respect that.\n\n2:50:59.720 --> 2:51:01.120\n But at the same time there,\n\n2:51:01.120 --> 2:51:03.520\n it seems like the kind of people that go there,\n\n2:51:04.520 --> 2:51:09.520\n I mean, the rules of the outside world are suspended\n\n2:51:09.840 --> 2:51:14.840\n in the sense that the crime, the aggression,\n\n2:51:17.180 --> 2:51:19.860\n the tensions, all of that seems to dissipate somehow.\n\n2:51:19.860 --> 2:51:22.100\n Not all the way, not all the way.\n\n2:51:22.100 --> 2:51:25.920\n That, you know, you could look it up, you know,\n\n2:51:25.920 --> 2:51:27.080\n cause like there is tension.\n\n2:51:27.080 --> 2:51:29.480\n There's a lot of tension there between,\n\n2:51:30.760 --> 2:51:32.160\n it's called plug and plays.\n\n2:51:32.160 --> 2:51:34.160\n Like, you know, Burning Man,\n\n2:51:34.160 --> 2:51:36.880\n like the history of Burning Man is fascinating.\n\n2:51:36.880 --> 2:51:41.480\n It has its roots in the cacophony society\n\n2:51:41.480 --> 2:51:42.320\n is what it was called,\n\n2:51:42.320 --> 2:51:45.840\n which is a sort of evolution of something that was,\n\n2:51:45.840 --> 2:51:50.540\n I think it was called the God, like the San Francisco.\n\n2:51:50.540 --> 2:51:54.360\n Basically there was like an art movement in San Francisco.\n\n2:51:54.360 --> 2:51:55.560\n And I can't remember the name of it.\n\n2:51:55.560 --> 2:51:59.040\n Maybe the Suicide Club or essentially like,\n\n2:51:59.920 --> 2:52:02.360\n they were really into urban exploration\n\n2:52:02.360 --> 2:52:05.720\n and meaning like breaking into like\n\n2:52:05.720 --> 2:52:07.860\n old abandoned buildings and stuff.\n\n2:52:07.860 --> 2:52:11.040\n But part of this, what this was, was\n\n2:52:13.240 --> 2:52:15.680\n you would prepare your life\n\n2:52:15.680 --> 2:52:18.000\n as though you were going to kill yourself.\n\n2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:19.840\n You would get all your affairs in order.\n\n2:52:19.840 --> 2:52:22.280\n You would get, so it's going back to what we were talking\n\n2:52:22.280 --> 2:52:23.440\n about with the cancer diagnosis.\n\n2:52:23.440 --> 2:52:27.960\n You're like sort of putting yourself into that world\n\n2:52:27.960 --> 2:52:29.520\n of like, I'm going to get all my affairs together\n\n2:52:29.520 --> 2:52:30.360\n as though this is it.\n\n2:52:30.360 --> 2:52:31.960\n And then there was some,\n\n2:52:31.960 --> 2:52:33.800\n I'm sorry for anyone listening if I'm butchering this,\n\n2:52:33.800 --> 2:52:35.840\n but I think there was some really cool initiation\n\n2:52:35.840 --> 2:52:37.600\n where they would blindfold you\n\n2:52:37.600 --> 2:52:38.560\n and they would take you into\n\n2:52:38.560 --> 2:52:40.560\n some of these abandoned buildings.\n\n2:52:40.560 --> 2:52:41.940\n And you didn't know where you were walking,\n\n2:52:41.940 --> 2:52:42.780\n but they would say like,\n\n2:52:42.780 --> 2:52:47.060\n if you take one step to the left, you're going to die.\n\n2:52:47.060 --> 2:52:48.080\n You're going to fall off.\n\n2:52:48.080 --> 2:52:48.900\n You're going to fall.\n\n2:52:48.900 --> 2:52:50.140\n So please be careful.\n\n2:52:50.140 --> 2:52:52.520\n So you're like in the moment\n\n2:52:52.520 --> 2:52:53.920\n and then blindfold comes off.\n\n2:52:53.920 --> 2:52:55.640\n It's a big, awesome party.\n\n2:52:55.640 --> 2:52:58.960\n This evolves into something called the Cacophony Society.\n\n2:52:58.960 --> 2:52:59.840\n There's a great book called\n\n2:52:59.840 --> 2:53:02.540\n Tales of the Cacophony Society for people listening.\n\n2:53:04.080 --> 2:53:07.760\n One of the members of the Cacophony Society\n\n2:53:07.760 --> 2:53:09.880\n was the author of Fight Club.\n\n2:53:09.880 --> 2:53:11.640\n And so if you've seen Fight Club,\n\n2:53:11.640 --> 2:53:13.200\n like you could see little ideas\n\n2:53:13.200 --> 2:53:14.920\n that were in the Cacophony Society.\n\n2:53:14.920 --> 2:53:19.920\n They were into Dadaism, which I don't know a lot about.\n\n2:53:19.920 --> 2:53:23.120\n I don't know, but it's a philosophical art movement.\n\n2:53:24.640 --> 2:53:27.800\n And then so basically what was happening is like,\n\n2:53:27.800 --> 2:53:30.920\n they kept burning increasingly large effigies\n\n2:53:30.920 --> 2:53:34.280\n in San Francisco and they weren't allowed to do it.\n\n2:53:34.280 --> 2:53:36.360\n And so they took it out in the desert\n\n2:53:36.360 --> 2:53:40.720\n and they were basing it on something called a zone trip,\n\n2:53:40.720 --> 2:53:43.660\n which is like, across this border,\n\n2:53:43.660 --> 2:53:46.200\n the rules of that old society are gone.\n\n2:53:46.200 --> 2:53:50.040\n And so that was the original Burning Man,\n\n2:53:50.040 --> 2:53:55.040\n which was these lunatics out in the desert,\n\n2:53:55.080 --> 2:53:59.600\n launching like burning pianos out of catapults\n\n2:53:59.600 --> 2:54:03.320\n through the air doing like drive by shooting ranges,\n\n2:54:03.320 --> 2:54:08.320\n like no rules, wild, magical, beautiful, insane madness.\n\n2:54:09.680 --> 2:54:14.440\n And then it grew and grew and grew and grew\n\n2:54:14.440 --> 2:54:17.280\n until you have Burning Man as it is today,\n\n2:54:17.280 --> 2:54:19.440\n which is still the most incredible thing.\n\n2:54:19.440 --> 2:54:22.000\n I mean, obviously anytime you have like a thing\n\n2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:24.420\n that's been around for a while, you're gonna get that.\n\n2:54:24.420 --> 2:54:26.280\n It's not like it used to be.\n\n2:54:26.280 --> 2:54:28.180\n It's not as free as it used to be, so this or that.\n\n2:54:28.180 --> 2:54:30.220\n But what's fascinating about Burning Man,\n\n2:54:30.220 --> 2:54:33.340\n someone pointed this out to me, look on the ground,\n\n2:54:34.480 --> 2:54:37.800\n no trash, no cigarettes.\n\n2:54:37.800 --> 2:54:40.320\n The ethic of like picking up your shit there\n\n2:54:40.320 --> 2:54:42.400\n is like so intense.\n\n2:54:42.400 --> 2:54:44.760\n So it's not like the other festivals you go to\n\n2:54:44.760 --> 2:54:46.520\n where there's just trash everywhere,\n\n2:54:46.520 --> 2:54:48.440\n shit scattered everywhere.\n\n2:54:48.440 --> 2:54:49.360\n It's clean.\n\n2:54:49.360 --> 2:54:51.440\n People are picking up their stuff.\n\n2:54:51.440 --> 2:54:54.520\n People are like really being conscious\n\n2:54:54.520 --> 2:54:56.440\n of like not fucking up the playa.\n\n2:54:56.440 --> 2:55:01.440\n So I'm sorry, don't get a burner yapping about Burning Man.\n\n2:55:01.440 --> 2:55:02.800\n We won't stop.\n\n2:55:02.800 --> 2:55:03.720\n It'll be morning.\n\n2:55:03.720 --> 2:55:05.640\n But there's a power,\n\n2:55:05.640 --> 2:55:08.840\n but there is a power to culture propagating itself\n\n2:55:08.840 --> 2:55:10.880\n through to the stories that we tell each other.\n\n2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:14.440\n And that holds up for Burning Man.\n\n2:55:14.440 --> 2:55:16.880\n It's clear that the culture has stayed strong\n\n2:55:16.880 --> 2:55:18.200\n throughout the years.\n\n2:55:18.200 --> 2:55:22.080\n So many people, so many really interesting people\n\n2:55:23.240 --> 2:55:28.240\n speak of Burning Man as like a sacred place they go to\n\n2:55:28.760 --> 2:55:31.520\n to remind themselves about what's important.\n\n2:55:31.520 --> 2:55:32.560\n That's so interesting.\n\n2:55:32.560 --> 2:55:33.560\n And it is.\n\n2:55:33.560 --> 2:55:34.400\n And it is.\n\n2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:36.240\n I mean, it's like, you know, there are all these stories\n\n2:55:36.240 --> 2:55:38.240\n of like, I love guru stories.\n\n2:55:38.240 --> 2:55:39.080\n I have a guru.\n\n2:55:39.080 --> 2:55:42.280\n I'm Karoli Baba, never met him, he was Ram Dass's guru,\n\n2:55:42.280 --> 2:55:43.720\n at least not in the flesh.\n\n2:55:43.720 --> 2:55:46.600\n But the story of the guru is if you're lucky,\n\n2:55:46.600 --> 2:55:48.880\n you meet this being that,\n\n2:55:48.880 --> 2:55:50.320\n and we're not talking about, you know,\n\n2:55:50.320 --> 2:55:54.240\n whatever the run of the mill, like charlatans out there.\n\n2:55:54.240 --> 2:55:59.240\n Like I know for sure that people are in the world right now\n\n2:56:00.280 --> 2:56:05.280\n who when you're around them,\n\n2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:07.000\n the thing you're talking about,\n\n2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:10.520\n the affirmation of the potential of humanity\n\n2:56:10.520 --> 2:56:12.640\n and also just an acceptance of yourself\n\n2:56:12.640 --> 2:56:14.600\n and, you know, cultivate,\n\n2:56:14.600 --> 2:56:19.240\n like seeing someone who's cultivated love or compassion\n\n2:56:19.240 --> 2:56:21.160\n or whatever, but in this way that is,\n\n2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:25.440\n I mean, you would almost,\n\n2:56:26.720 --> 2:56:28.440\n you would rather meet that being\n\n2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:30.440\n than like a UFO land in your backyard.\n\n2:56:30.440 --> 2:56:31.840\n It's like, it is the UFO.\n\n2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:33.720\n It's a person, but it's not.\n\n2:56:33.720 --> 2:56:35.920\n It's everybody and nobody.\n\n2:56:35.920 --> 2:56:40.560\n And somehow they like end up conveying to you\n\n2:56:42.120 --> 2:56:45.200\n ideas that you may have heard a million times before,\n\n2:56:45.200 --> 2:56:49.360\n but somehow within the language itself is a transmission\n\n2:56:49.360 --> 2:56:52.280\n that permanently alters you.\n\n2:56:52.280 --> 2:56:54.800\n And so these people exist.\n\n2:56:54.800 --> 2:56:57.120\n I think you could argue that Burning Man,\n\n2:56:58.480 --> 2:57:01.640\n the total thing is a guru,\n\n2:57:01.640 --> 2:57:04.800\n that a pilgrimage is involved to get there.\n\n2:57:04.800 --> 2:57:08.240\n You, like, it's not easy to get there.\n\n2:57:08.240 --> 2:57:12.760\n And when you get there, it's gonna teach you something.\n\n2:57:12.760 --> 2:57:14.200\n It's gonna show you something.\n\n2:57:14.200 --> 2:57:17.680\n It's going to, and maybe some of the stuff it shows you\n\n2:57:17.680 --> 2:57:22.680\n might not be great, but the community around you\n\n2:57:22.960 --> 2:57:27.160\n will like, will hold you as you're like,\n\n2:57:27.160 --> 2:57:29.240\n whatever the thing is that's coming out of you\n\n2:57:29.240 --> 2:57:30.120\n is coming out of you.\n\n2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:31.600\n And even the simplest activities,\n\n2:57:31.600 --> 2:57:35.920\n the simplest exchange of words have like,\n\n2:57:35.920 --> 2:57:40.920\n just like the gurus, a profound impact somehow.\n\n2:57:41.160 --> 2:57:42.520\n Something about that place.\n\n2:57:42.520 --> 2:57:46.440\n Yeah, not to mention the insane synchronicities,\n\n2:57:46.440 --> 2:57:48.800\n like insane synchronicities there.\n\n2:57:48.800 --> 2:57:51.760\n And I think like, you know, to get back to the notion\n\n2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:56.760\n of sentience as a byproduct of a harmonized\n\n2:57:56.760 --> 2:57:58.760\n yet hyper complex system.\n\n2:57:58.760 --> 2:58:03.120\n I think synchronicities, like those kinds of systems\n\n2:58:03.120 --> 2:58:05.240\n are like lightning rods for synchronicity.\n\n2:58:05.240 --> 2:58:10.240\n So crazy, not just because your high synchronicities\n\n2:58:10.960 --> 2:58:13.200\n happen that are impossible,\n\n2:58:13.200 --> 2:58:14.800\n where you just have to deal with it.\n\n2:58:14.800 --> 2:58:16.880\n And like, you'll need something.\n\n2:58:16.880 --> 2:58:19.120\n And within a few minutes, someone's like,\n\n2:58:19.120 --> 2:58:20.720\n oh, here you go.\n\n2:58:20.720 --> 2:58:22.240\n And you mentioned, but by the way,\n\n2:58:22.240 --> 2:58:25.640\n Burning Anchors of a psychedelic experience,\n\n2:58:25.640 --> 2:58:29.280\n is it the strawberries or was it something else?\n\n2:58:29.280 --> 2:58:30.760\n What was the moment?\n\n2:58:30.760 --> 2:58:31.640\n Yeah, that was magical.\n\n2:58:31.640 --> 2:58:32.640\n No, it was DMT.\n\n2:58:32.640 --> 2:58:33.480\n It definitely wasn't.\n\n2:58:33.480 --> 2:58:35.760\n It wasn't strawberries.\n\n2:58:35.760 --> 2:58:36.600\n Ah.\n\n2:58:38.160 --> 2:58:39.760\n No, no, I was.\n\n2:58:39.760 --> 2:58:41.000\n More potent.\n\n2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:43.480\n Yeah, I was like smoking DMT.\n\n2:58:43.480 --> 2:58:48.480\n And like, I saw, like, if you, in the midnight gospel,\n\n2:58:48.480 --> 2:58:53.480\n there are these bovine creatures that have like a long neck\n\n2:58:56.600 --> 2:58:58.600\n and a lantern head.\n\n2:58:58.600 --> 2:59:01.880\n So like, I saw one of those things.\n\n2:59:01.880 --> 2:59:06.880\n And, you know, I thought it was funny and like ridiculous\n\n2:59:11.200 --> 2:59:13.280\n because you hear like all the Terence McKenna stories\n\n2:59:13.280 --> 2:59:16.600\n of the self transforming machine elves\n\n2:59:16.600 --> 2:59:20.720\n or all the purple or the magenta goddess everyone sees.\n\n2:59:20.720 --> 2:59:22.920\n I'm like, so this is what I get?\n\n2:59:22.920 --> 2:59:26.280\n Like a fucking cow with a lantern head?\n\n2:59:26.280 --> 2:59:28.280\n Like that's where my brain is at\n\n2:59:28.280 --> 2:59:30.760\n and we're interacting with this molecule.\n\n2:59:30.760 --> 2:59:35.640\n So then like, I look away.\n\n2:59:38.360 --> 2:59:39.600\n And again, this is DMT.\n\n2:59:39.600 --> 2:59:42.120\n So when I say look away, do I mean with my eyes shut,\n\n2:59:42.120 --> 2:59:46.040\n I look away or eyes open, I look away, I think eyes shut.\n\n2:59:46.040 --> 2:59:47.760\n So it sounds weird to say look away,\n\n2:59:47.760 --> 2:59:51.920\n but however you want to put it, that's what I did.\n\n2:59:51.920 --> 2:59:54.920\n And I look back and it's still there.\n\n2:59:54.920 --> 2:59:57.040\n Only now it's, you know, cause usually in like,\n\n2:59:57.040 --> 2:59:58.960\n when you're having those kinds of visions,\n\n2:59:58.960 --> 3:00:01.240\n they go away pretty quickly.\n\n3:00:01.240 --> 3:00:04.280\n This thing's like moved, like shambled ahead\n\n3:00:04.280 --> 3:00:08.280\n and maybe a few steps, just like a cow, just like a cow.\n\n3:00:08.280 --> 3:00:12.040\n And then that was when the, you know,\n\n3:00:12.040 --> 3:00:13.320\n all the stories you hear about it,\n\n3:00:13.320 --> 3:00:15.920\n like going through some kind of tuber,\n\n3:00:15.920 --> 3:00:18.080\n some kind of light tunnel, like a water slide\n\n3:00:18.080 --> 3:00:21.840\n made of light that's increasingly familiar.\n\n3:00:21.840 --> 3:00:23.400\n That's the wildest part of it.\n\n3:00:23.400 --> 3:00:25.200\n It's like, oh, I know this place.\n\n3:00:25.200 --> 3:00:27.160\n Not like, oh, I've seen this in like,\n\n3:00:27.160 --> 3:00:30.560\n you know, on like bong stickers, but like,\n\n3:00:30.560 --> 3:00:32.320\n oh yeah, this is that place you go to.\n\n3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:34.440\n You just remember, oh, this place.\n\n3:00:34.440 --> 3:00:39.040\n And then it was like I was in some kind of,\n\n3:00:40.840 --> 3:00:42.760\n I don't know how to put it, a chamber,\n\n3:00:42.760 --> 3:00:45.920\n a technological chamber, some kind of supercomputer,\n\n3:00:45.920 --> 3:00:49.440\n some kind of nucleus that was technological.\n\n3:00:49.440 --> 3:00:50.520\n And it was inviting.\n\n3:00:50.520 --> 3:00:53.360\n There was an invitation of like, come in,\n\n3:00:53.360 --> 3:00:56.400\n like come deeper into, come deeper in.\n\n3:00:56.400 --> 3:01:00.160\n And you can talk to whatever it is over there.\n\n3:01:00.160 --> 3:01:02.760\n You don't talk, but there's a communication.\n\n3:01:02.760 --> 3:01:07.760\n And I communicated, but my friends, I don't,\n\n3:01:07.880 --> 3:01:08.800\n I love my friends.\n\n3:01:08.800 --> 3:01:10.400\n I guess I had some sense in that moment\n\n3:01:10.400 --> 3:01:12.960\n that it would mean complete obliteration\n\n3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:15.160\n or who knows what.\n\n3:01:15.160 --> 3:01:18.240\n And the response that it gave back was,\n\n3:01:18.240 --> 3:01:20.600\n you can always go back there.\n\n3:01:20.600 --> 3:01:22.400\n And that's when I opened my eyes, I'm back.\n\n3:01:22.400 --> 3:01:25.480\n Totally, you know, and ever since then,\n\n3:01:25.480 --> 3:01:30.480\n that's caused me to revise my thinking on reincarnation.\n\n3:01:30.760 --> 3:01:33.320\n The idea that you die and you start as a baby\n\n3:01:33.320 --> 3:01:34.880\n and then live your life again.\n\n3:01:34.880 --> 3:01:36.920\n It goes right into what we were talking about.\n\n3:01:36.920 --> 3:01:39.680\n You know, that maybe data, you know,\n\n3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:41.360\n that the shit I saw in Nitro Sox,\n\n3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:43.760\n I don't feel dumb that my epiphanies are all related\n\n3:01:43.760 --> 3:01:46.240\n to drugs, but not all of them are a lot of them.\n\n3:01:46.240 --> 3:01:49.720\n But this notion of like, oh, is it that we're\n\n3:01:52.280 --> 3:01:56.040\n imprinting into the medium of time, space,\n\n3:01:56.040 --> 3:02:01.040\n everything we do, and that that is a permanent imprint,\n\n3:02:01.280 --> 3:02:06.280\n a frame that upon death can be accessed\n\n3:02:06.280 --> 3:02:10.760\n in the same way we can pull up pictures on our phone\n\n3:02:10.760 --> 3:02:15.400\n or computers, and not only accessed, but experienced\n\n3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:20.200\n as though, in other words, you could just jump in.\n\n3:02:20.200 --> 3:02:22.040\n You're still gonna have your memories.\n\n3:02:22.040 --> 3:02:26.280\n It's gonna give you the illusion of having been a kid\n\n3:02:26.280 --> 3:02:28.800\n and gotten to that frame, but no,\n\n3:02:28.800 --> 3:02:33.260\n you just decided to go back there, nostalgia, whatever.\n\n3:02:33.260 --> 3:02:37.360\n And yeah, you can jump around freely in space and time.\n\n3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:40.160\n Yeah, yeah, you can go in and out of time space,\n\n3:02:40.160 --> 3:02:43.840\n but the problem is when you go into time space, it's time.\n\n3:02:43.840 --> 3:02:45.260\n So it's gonna feel sticky.\n\n3:02:45.260 --> 3:02:46.640\n It's gonna feel like you've been here forever\n\n3:02:46.640 --> 3:02:49.040\n because you've dropped back onto the track\n\n3:02:49.040 --> 3:02:50.640\n that Nietzsche's talking about.\n\n3:02:51.640 --> 3:02:54.200\n And I guess one of the qualities of dropping\n\n3:02:54.200 --> 3:02:57.040\n into that frame is that you forget\n\n3:02:57.040 --> 3:03:01.000\n your higher dimensional identity.\n\n3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:05.920\n What happened to the cow with the lantern, was that goodbye?\n\n3:03:07.840 --> 3:03:09.540\n He writes me letters sometimes.\n\n3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:12.280\n Never saw it again.\n\n3:03:12.280 --> 3:03:13.120\n Never?\n\n3:03:13.120 --> 3:03:15.240\n Never saw it again, but I put it in,\n\n3:03:15.240 --> 3:03:17.000\n we put it in the Midnight Gospel.\n\n3:03:18.120 --> 3:03:22.060\n Pendleton was such a genius, and he drew it for me,\n\n3:03:22.060 --> 3:03:24.400\n and then it just ended up as a part of the show.\n\n3:03:24.400 --> 3:03:27.960\n But by the way, I have to admit that as a big fan of yours,\n\n3:03:27.960 --> 3:03:29.840\n I haven't watched the Midnight Gospel\n\n3:03:29.840 --> 3:03:31.720\n because I've been waiting.\n\n3:03:33.200 --> 3:03:36.400\n You do these stupid things, but ever since you talked to,\n\n3:03:36.400 --> 3:03:39.800\n maybe two years ago with Joe about it,\n\n3:03:39.800 --> 3:03:41.920\n I've been waiting to watch it\n\n3:03:41.920 --> 3:03:44.680\n with a special person on mushrooms.\n\n3:03:44.680 --> 3:03:46.280\n That's been in my to do.\n\n3:03:46.280 --> 3:03:48.560\n I don't know, of course you don't have to be on mushrooms\n\n3:03:48.560 --> 3:03:52.480\n to enjoy it, but for some reason I put it into my head\n\n3:03:52.480 --> 3:03:55.040\n that this is something I wanna do with somebody else,\n\n3:03:55.040 --> 3:03:57.040\n like experience it and get wild.\n\n3:03:57.040 --> 3:04:00.920\n Because visually, I mean, I watched a bunch of it,\n\n3:04:00.920 --> 3:04:02.520\n just a little bit here and there,\n\n3:04:02.520 --> 3:04:05.940\n but it's just visually such an interesting experience.\n\n3:04:06.800 --> 3:04:07.640\n Thank you.\n\n3:04:07.640 --> 3:04:09.000\n Combined with everything else, obviously,\n\n3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:12.100\n the ideas, the voices and so on,\n\n3:04:12.100 --> 3:04:16.940\n but just visually it's like a super psychedelic version\n\n3:04:16.940 --> 3:04:19.360\n of Rick and Morty or something like that,\n\n3:04:19.360 --> 3:04:23.080\n like farther out, wilder out there.\n\n3:04:23.080 --> 3:04:26.080\n Yeah, man, that's Pendleton.\n\n3:04:26.080 --> 3:04:29.920\n These people, I mean, I was part of that\n\n3:04:31.800 --> 3:04:35.320\n in the sense that Pendleton gave,\n\n3:04:35.320 --> 3:04:37.080\n one of the reasons he's such a genius\n\n3:04:37.080 --> 3:04:41.240\n and great at making stuff is he really does a good job\n\n3:04:41.240 --> 3:04:46.120\n of just dehierarchizing potential hierarchies\n\n3:04:46.120 --> 3:04:47.520\n that can appear.\n\n3:04:47.520 --> 3:04:51.240\n Someone has to be driving the bus, and that was Pendleton,\n\n3:04:51.240 --> 3:04:54.120\n but he's so inclusive.\n\n3:04:54.120 --> 3:04:57.260\n There's a real punk rock thing that he's doing,\n\n3:04:57.260 --> 3:04:58.900\n which is like, he'll take everything,\n\n3:04:58.900 --> 3:05:01.240\n and it kind of mixes its way into the show.\n\n3:05:01.240 --> 3:05:06.240\n But one of the things in animation,\n\n3:05:07.100 --> 3:05:11.800\n it can get really strict with drawing the characters\n\n3:05:11.800 --> 3:05:16.620\n and trying to create continuity\n\n3:05:16.620 --> 3:05:19.280\n in the way the character looks,\n\n3:05:19.280 --> 3:05:21.840\n and it can get really brute for the animator.\n\n3:05:21.840 --> 3:05:26.400\n Making it brutally precise, like it has to be precise.\n\n3:05:26.400 --> 3:05:28.600\n But he figured out that if you just sort of,\n\n3:05:30.300 --> 3:05:33.320\n it's not like, obviously, Clancy had to look like Clancy\n\n3:05:33.320 --> 3:05:34.160\n through the whole show,\n\n3:05:34.160 --> 3:05:36.560\n but if you allow the various people animating it\n\n3:05:36.560 --> 3:05:39.320\n to sort of have their own spin on it,\n\n3:05:39.320 --> 3:05:42.240\n then suddenly it creates a very psychedelic,\n\n3:05:43.400 --> 3:05:45.080\n the show looks more psychedelic\n\n3:05:45.080 --> 3:05:48.240\n because it looks more organic, and also the amount of time.\n\n3:05:48.240 --> 3:05:53.120\n I had no idea, the amount of time that goes into making\n\n3:05:53.120 --> 3:05:58.120\n digital art look like that is, it's insane.\n\n3:05:58.680 --> 3:06:03.680\n The amount of work in comping that stuff is just crazy.\n\n3:06:03.960 --> 3:06:04.960\n It's crazy.\n\n3:06:04.960 --> 3:06:07.380\n Generally, the amount of time it takes,\n\n3:06:07.380 --> 3:06:09.360\n even just like a painting,\n\n3:06:09.360 --> 3:06:13.280\n when you, I really enjoy watching artists do a time lapse,\n\n3:06:13.280 --> 3:06:17.760\n and you realize how much effort just into a single image\n\n3:06:17.760 --> 3:06:19.300\n goes into it.\n\n3:06:19.300 --> 3:06:21.080\n Hours and hours and hours, sometimes days,\n\n3:06:21.080 --> 3:06:23.160\n sometimes weeks and months,\n\n3:06:23.160 --> 3:06:24.820\n and then you just get to see them work,\n\n3:06:24.820 --> 3:06:28.440\n but they lose themselves in the craftsmanship of it,\n\n3:06:28.440 --> 3:06:30.440\n in the rhythm of it.\n\n3:06:30.440 --> 3:06:32.720\n And like, because they're focused on the,\n\n3:06:32.720 --> 3:06:34.520\n so we were talking about robotics earlier,\n\n3:06:34.520 --> 3:06:37.320\n like on the little details, like they're never look,\n\n3:06:37.320 --> 3:06:40.040\n well, most of the time isn't spent looking\n\n3:06:40.040 --> 3:06:41.760\n at the big picture of the final result,\n\n3:06:41.760 --> 3:06:44.000\n it's looking at the little details there and so on.\n\n3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:46.280\n And they're, but they're nevertheless able\n\n3:06:46.280 --> 3:06:49.360\n to somehow constantly channel the big picture,\n\n3:06:49.360 --> 3:06:50.440\n the final result.\n\n3:06:50.440 --> 3:06:53.840\n My God, yeah, the respect I have for animators,\n\n3:06:53.840 --> 3:06:58.720\n it's like, dear God, it's the craziest thing\n\n3:06:58.720 --> 3:07:01.180\n when you watch it, when you see what it looks like\n\n3:07:01.180 --> 3:07:04.600\n and how much time goes into it and how zen they have to be,\n\n3:07:04.600 --> 3:07:05.440\n because like, no matter what,\n\n3:07:05.440 --> 3:07:07.240\n you're gonna have to cut stuff, man.\n\n3:07:07.240 --> 3:07:10.400\n And when you're cutting like a few seconds of animation,\n\n3:07:10.400 --> 3:07:13.360\n that was someone's like month, maybe, you know?\n\n3:07:13.360 --> 3:07:17.760\n And like, they understand, but still it's like, whoa,\n\n3:07:17.760 --> 3:07:19.060\n it's brutal.\n\n3:07:19.060 --> 3:07:24.060\n And so they have like this zen outlook on it,\n\n3:07:24.520 --> 3:07:26.320\n which is really cool.\n\n3:07:26.320 --> 3:07:28.080\n And they watch podcasts, that's the other cool thing,\n\n3:07:28.080 --> 3:07:30.420\n when you realize like, oh, they're listening to podcasts\n\n3:07:30.420 --> 3:07:34.360\n or like, that's really cool to see that aspect of it too.\n\n3:07:34.360 --> 3:07:36.880\n But yeah, man, I, you know.\n\n3:07:36.880 --> 3:07:38.460\n Yeah, your voice is in the ears\n\n3:07:38.460 --> 3:07:40.560\n of a lot of interesting people, isn't it?\n\n3:07:40.560 --> 3:07:41.400\n Yours too.\n\n3:07:41.400 --> 3:07:42.680\n And I, you know.\n\n3:07:42.680 --> 3:07:43.880\n Hello, interesting person.\n\n3:07:43.880 --> 3:07:46.880\n Hello, CIA, animators.\n\n3:07:46.880 --> 3:07:49.560\n Eating delicious food in the cafeteria.\n\n3:07:49.560 --> 3:07:50.600\n Yeah. I'm on your side.\n\n3:07:50.600 --> 3:07:52.360\n He's against you, I'm with you.\n\n3:07:52.360 --> 3:07:53.600\n Yeah.\n\n3:07:53.600 --> 3:07:56.920\n Do you have, you have a beard, therefore you must be wise.\n\n3:07:56.920 --> 3:08:01.340\n Do you have advice for young people, high school, college,\n\n3:08:02.840 --> 3:08:05.440\n about how to carve their path through life?\n\n3:08:05.440 --> 3:08:10.040\n I don't have a life, a career that's successful\n\n3:08:10.040 --> 3:08:12.840\n that they can be proud of or a life they can be proud of.\n\n3:08:12.840 --> 3:08:14.760\n Man, see, this is what kind of,\n\n3:08:14.760 --> 3:08:18.320\n this is what sucks about my life,\n\n3:08:18.320 --> 3:08:23.320\n is that it's been very random and very spontaneous.\n\n3:08:23.600 --> 3:08:27.080\n So unfortunately, I don't get that thing\n\n3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:28.960\n where I could be like, well, here's what I did.\n\n3:08:28.960 --> 3:08:29.800\n Yeah.\n\n3:08:29.800 --> 3:08:34.200\n Cause it's like, I don't, like I inherited $12,000\n\n3:08:34.200 --> 3:08:36.960\n from my grandmother, here's what you do kids,\n\n3:08:36.960 --> 3:08:39.600\n you inherit $12,000 when your grandmother dies.\n\n3:08:39.600 --> 3:08:41.640\n And then you need to be dumb enough\n\n3:08:41.640 --> 3:08:44.480\n to think that that $12,000 is gonna help you\n\n3:08:44.480 --> 3:08:46.200\n live in LA for a year.\n\n3:08:46.200 --> 3:08:49.760\n So then what you do is you move to LA with $12,000\n\n3:08:49.760 --> 3:08:53.740\n and you find a shitty place that you live at.\n\n3:08:53.740 --> 3:08:58.040\n And then you use that money to buy acid and synthesizers.\n\n3:08:58.040 --> 3:09:00.720\n And then you run out of the money and then you,\n\n3:09:02.280 --> 3:09:03.960\n then you have to get a job.\n\n3:09:03.960 --> 3:09:05.580\n And so then, because you think it'll be fun\n\n3:09:05.580 --> 3:09:09.220\n to work at a comedy club, you get a job at the comedy store.\n\n3:09:09.220 --> 3:09:11.920\n And then, you know, that's how it happened for me.\n\n3:09:11.920 --> 3:09:15.080\n And none of, there wasn't, I never had the confidence\n\n3:09:15.080 --> 3:09:18.520\n to be like, I'm gonna be a standup comedian.\n\n3:09:18.520 --> 3:09:19.360\n No way.\n\n3:09:19.360 --> 3:09:22.080\n I just thought it'd be cool to work in that building.\n\n3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:23.800\n I thought the building looked cool.\n\n3:09:23.800 --> 3:09:26.480\n And so, but then like, cause like you work\n\n3:09:26.480 --> 3:09:28.520\n at the comedy store, you get stage time.\n\n3:09:28.520 --> 3:09:32.240\n It's there, it's the reason like you work there\n\n3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:34.400\n is at least in those days, cause it's not like\n\n3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:36.680\n they're paying like a shit ton of money\n\n3:09:36.680 --> 3:09:39.120\n for you to answer phones at a comedy club.\n\n3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:42.440\n And so, you know, I started going on stage\n\n3:09:42.440 --> 3:09:46.000\n and then like, I just got lucky\n\n3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:50.360\n cause Rogan saw me have like a very rare, good set.\n\n3:09:50.360 --> 3:09:52.560\n I didn't know he was in the room or I would've bombed,\n\n3:09:52.560 --> 3:09:55.120\n you know, and then like, cause he thought I was funny\n\n3:09:55.120 --> 3:09:56.040\n and he liked talking to me.\n\n3:09:56.040 --> 3:09:57.900\n He started taking me on the road with him.\n\n3:09:57.900 --> 3:09:59.640\n And then, you know, so I don't know, man.\n\n3:09:59.640 --> 3:10:00.480\n I think.\n\n3:10:01.560 --> 3:10:04.160\n Was there an element to, there's a beautiful weirdness\n\n3:10:04.160 --> 3:10:06.680\n to you as a human being.\n\n3:10:06.680 --> 3:10:11.680\n Was there like a pressure to conform ever\n\n3:10:12.520 --> 3:10:15.620\n to hide yourself from the world?\n\n3:10:15.620 --> 3:10:19.240\n Or did the $12,000 in the acid give you\n\n3:10:19.240 --> 3:10:21.640\n the confidence you needed to be yourself?\n\n3:10:21.640 --> 3:10:24.440\n Oh no, I don't, like I still, no.\n\n3:10:24.440 --> 3:10:26.760\n I think, sure, there's that pressure.\n\n3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:30.080\n And like, you know, whenever you're beginning\n\n3:10:30.080 --> 3:10:31.840\n to really differentiate from your parents,\n\n3:10:31.840 --> 3:10:34.040\n but then you go back to hang out with your parents,\n\n3:10:34.040 --> 3:10:38.040\n you can feel that it's not like they even want you\n\n3:10:38.040 --> 3:10:40.420\n to conform, but you'll just, you could slip into that,\n\n3:10:40.420 --> 3:10:41.320\n whatever that was.\n\n3:10:41.320 --> 3:10:42.980\n So I remember that when I would go back\n\n3:10:42.980 --> 3:10:45.280\n and like visit them and stuff.\n\n3:10:45.280 --> 3:10:50.280\n And surely conformity or the pressure to like,\n\n3:10:50.440 --> 3:10:53.860\n not be individual or whatever, it's everywhere, man.\n\n3:10:53.860 --> 3:10:55.960\n Do you think you made your parents proud?\n\n3:10:58.600 --> 3:11:03.320\n E, no, no, no, no.\n\n3:11:03.320 --> 3:11:06.860\n Well, I think that when my mom died,\n\n3:11:08.480 --> 3:11:13.080\n I felt successful in the sense that I was able\n\n3:11:13.080 --> 3:11:18.080\n to support my, I was making money from doing standup\n\n3:11:18.720 --> 3:11:20.000\n and I didn't need help.\n\n3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:22.600\n I was like, I was supporting myself with art\n\n3:11:22.600 --> 3:11:24.960\n and doing good, what I thought was great then.\n\n3:11:24.960 --> 3:11:29.400\n So, and I think she, like, because she had witnessed\n\n3:11:29.400 --> 3:11:32.380\n me literally failing, I mean, which is, by the way,\n\n3:11:32.380 --> 3:11:35.960\n I think part of, if you want to be an artist\n\n3:11:35.960 --> 3:11:38.640\n or successful, you kind of have to fail.\n\n3:11:38.640 --> 3:11:43.640\n Like there, if, and if there was a guaranteed route\n\n3:11:44.080 --> 3:11:49.080\n from sucking to not sucking or from like the neophyte phase\n\n3:11:52.520 --> 3:11:55.080\n of whatever the art form is and, you know,\n\n3:11:55.080 --> 3:11:58.120\n some intermediary phase, then I think a lot more people\n\n3:11:58.120 --> 3:12:01.720\n would do it, but there really is no guarantees in it,\n\n3:12:01.720 --> 3:12:03.200\n especially the standup comedy.\n\n3:12:03.200 --> 3:12:06.720\n It's like, you'd have to be a maniac to want to,\n\n3:12:06.720 --> 3:12:08.480\n to think that that's going to work out for you.\n\n3:12:08.480 --> 3:12:10.560\n You have to, so you're going to,\n\n3:12:11.960 --> 3:12:15.360\n there are obviously exceptions, but for me,\n\n3:12:15.360 --> 3:12:18.920\n it was like a long slog, you know,\n\n3:12:18.920 --> 3:12:20.400\n and that's scary for a mom.\n\n3:12:20.400 --> 3:12:25.400\n So, but that being said, when she was dying,\n\n3:12:26.160 --> 3:12:31.120\n like she did recognize that I was like not slogging anymore.\n\n3:12:31.120 --> 3:12:35.000\n And she did say, she said, you did it.\n\n3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:38.480\n And that's cool, but in, you know,\n\n3:12:38.480 --> 3:12:40.040\n I would love for her to see me now,\n\n3:12:40.040 --> 3:12:42.820\n like now it'd be way cooler, but maybe she does.\n\n3:12:42.820 --> 3:12:43.660\n I don't know.\n\n3:12:43.660 --> 3:12:47.240\n She's listening to your podcast elsewhere in the other,\n\n3:12:47.240 --> 3:12:48.440\n in the Bardo.\n\n3:12:48.440 --> 3:12:53.240\n Yeah, however long that lasts reconfiguring\n\n3:12:53.240 --> 3:12:55.000\n the whole process to start again.\n\n3:12:56.320 --> 3:12:59.600\n You as a father now, how did that change you?\n\n3:12:59.600 --> 3:13:02.160\n Yeah, that's the big change, man.\n\n3:13:02.160 --> 3:13:03.000\n That's the thing.\n\n3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:06.780\n You made a few biological entities.\n\n3:13:06.780 --> 3:13:08.640\n Yeah, I made biological entities.\n\n3:13:08.640 --> 3:13:10.920\n I mean, I came in my wife, let's face it.\n\n3:13:10.920 --> 3:13:12.360\n Like I would love to say I made them,\n\n3:13:12.360 --> 3:13:17.360\n but the womb whipped them up, but it is the,\n\n3:13:17.900 --> 3:13:18.880\n yeah, it's the best.\n\n3:13:18.880 --> 3:13:22.480\n It's, I've never experienced anything like it before.\n\n3:13:22.480 --> 3:13:24.920\n It is the, as far as I'm concerned,\n\n3:13:24.920 --> 3:13:27.800\n the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.\n\n3:13:27.800 --> 3:13:30.520\n And that's why I was able to answer your Nietzsche question\n\n3:13:30.520 --> 3:13:33.000\n with like, hell yes, fuck yes.\n\n3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:33.840\n That's great.\n\n3:13:33.840 --> 3:13:35.200\n I get to be around my kids again.\n\n3:13:35.200 --> 3:13:36.360\n I'll always be around my kids.\n\n3:13:36.360 --> 3:13:38.300\n I'll always be around my children.\n\n3:13:38.300 --> 3:13:39.140\n That's incredible.\n\n3:13:39.140 --> 3:13:39.980\n That's the joy.\n\n3:13:39.980 --> 3:13:41.880\n So like, so for me,\n\n3:13:45.240 --> 3:13:48.320\n the part of myself that used to torture myself more,\n\n3:13:48.320 --> 3:13:51.040\n especially like around like my mom dying,\n\n3:13:51.040 --> 3:13:53.680\n feeling like I wasn't there enough for her,\n\n3:13:53.680 --> 3:13:56.060\n wishing that I had spent more time with her,\n\n3:13:56.060 --> 3:13:58.200\n wishing I'd spent more time with my dad,\n\n3:13:58.200 --> 3:14:01.760\n wishing that like, looking back at like how like\n\n3:14:01.760 --> 3:14:05.400\n I was just so desperately trying to evade the fact\n\n3:14:05.400 --> 3:14:09.040\n that she was dying and through,\n\n3:14:09.040 --> 3:14:13.200\n and in that evasion successfully like distanced myself\n\n3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:16.380\n from her and like in ways that I really wish I hadn't.\n\n3:14:20.040 --> 3:14:22.200\n I'm just saying that because it's one of my regrets.\n\n3:14:22.200 --> 3:14:23.160\n It's like a big regret.\n\n3:14:23.160 --> 3:14:24.520\n I have a lot of little regrets,\n\n3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:26.280\n but that's a big one.\n\n3:14:26.280 --> 3:14:30.880\n And so when you have kids,\n\n3:14:33.140 --> 3:14:38.140\n you look back at everything you did\n\n3:14:38.240 --> 3:14:40.320\n and you think like, fuck,\n\n3:14:40.320 --> 3:14:43.580\n if I'd gone left at that point instead of right,\n\n3:14:43.580 --> 3:14:45.680\n if I had eaten, who knows?\n\n3:14:45.680 --> 3:14:48.780\n What if I'd eaten like a turkey sandwich\n\n3:14:48.780 --> 3:14:53.380\n when my balls were creating the cum\n\n3:14:53.380 --> 3:14:54.880\n that was gonna make my kids?\n\n3:14:54.880 --> 3:14:56.580\n Would I have a different kid?\n\n3:14:56.580 --> 3:14:59.000\n Would this being not exist in my life?\n\n3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:00.440\n Like you start looking at everything\n\n3:15:00.440 --> 3:15:03.540\n and you realize like, thank God,\n\n3:15:03.540 --> 3:15:06.400\n thank God for every single thing that happened to me\n\n3:15:06.400 --> 3:15:08.760\n because it all led up to this.\n\n3:15:08.760 --> 3:15:12.880\n And oh, for me, that is the, that's,\n\n3:15:12.880 --> 3:15:17.880\n that it's like, it frees you in this.\n\n3:15:18.240 --> 3:15:21.140\n It liberates you because you realize like,\n\n3:15:21.140 --> 3:15:23.720\n oh wow, it's clumsy and selfish\n\n3:15:23.720 --> 3:15:28.720\n and at times rotten as I've been in my life.\n\n3:15:29.400 --> 3:15:34.240\n That did not impede the universe at all\n\n3:15:34.240 --> 3:15:37.340\n from allowing these two beautiful beings\n\n3:15:37.340 --> 3:15:38.440\n to exist in the world.\n\n3:15:38.440 --> 3:15:40.360\n So maybe all of it enabled,\n\n3:15:40.360 --> 3:15:44.600\n all of it like a concert perfectly led up\n\n3:15:44.600 --> 3:15:47.560\n to that little beautiful moment.\n\n3:15:47.560 --> 3:15:52.560\n Is there ways you would like to be a better father?\n\n3:15:52.640 --> 3:15:54.360\n Oh yeah, for sure.\n\n3:15:54.360 --> 3:15:55.640\n Absolutely.\n\n3:15:55.640 --> 3:15:59.420\n There's a actual, I read something in a book,\n\n3:15:59.420 --> 3:16:00.960\n it's called Good Enough.\n\n3:16:00.960 --> 3:16:03.400\n The mantra for a parent, good enough.\n\n3:16:03.400 --> 3:16:05.000\n Because when you are in the presence\n\n3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:07.680\n of something you love more\n\n3:16:07.680 --> 3:16:10.660\n than you've ever experienced love,\n\n3:16:12.800 --> 3:16:15.520\n you wanna be perfect.\n\n3:16:15.520 --> 3:16:17.680\n Like you wanna be, I can't, I gotta work, man.\n\n3:16:17.680 --> 3:16:18.920\n I gotta go on the road.\n\n3:16:18.920 --> 3:16:19.760\n I've gotta work.\n\n3:16:19.760 --> 3:16:20.760\n I gotta support the family.\n\n3:16:20.760 --> 3:16:22.240\n So that means I have to work.\n\n3:16:22.240 --> 3:16:25.480\n Like I work, you know what it's like having a podcast.\n\n3:16:25.480 --> 3:16:26.800\n You fucking work, man.\n\n3:16:26.800 --> 3:16:31.440\n And you know, it's a full time job\n\n3:16:31.440 --> 3:16:33.860\n because I've, you know, I do standup too\n\n3:16:33.860 --> 3:16:34.720\n and all the other stuff.\n\n3:16:34.720 --> 3:16:38.720\n So I feel sometimes I feel like, oh my God,\n\n3:16:38.720 --> 3:16:40.660\n I wanna spend more time with them.\n\n3:16:40.660 --> 3:16:42.120\n Like I should be spending more time with them.\n\n3:16:42.120 --> 3:16:45.040\n But then also I wanna create, I wanna work.\n\n3:16:45.040 --> 3:16:49.000\n I like being like the provider.\n\n3:16:49.000 --> 3:16:53.600\n So that's something I feel guilty about, you know, right now.\n\n3:16:53.600 --> 3:16:56.600\n And you're struggling how to balance that correctly.\n\n3:16:56.600 --> 3:16:59.880\n And meanwhile, time just marches on.\n\n3:16:59.880 --> 3:17:03.280\n It just goes, it goes.\n\n3:17:03.280 --> 3:17:07.440\n And all of this will be forgotten.\n\n3:17:07.440 --> 3:17:11.600\n Both you and I, but forgotten in time.\n\n3:17:11.600 --> 3:17:12.420\n That's what I say to them\n\n3:17:12.420 --> 3:17:15.600\n every time I'm putting them to bed.\n\n3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:18.560\n We will be lost in the sands of time.\n\n3:17:18.560 --> 3:17:20.440\n You know that, I bet you know this poem.\n\n3:17:20.440 --> 3:17:22.440\n You know that poem, Ozymandias?\n\n3:17:22.440 --> 3:17:23.920\n Yes.\n\n3:17:23.920 --> 3:17:25.720\n Can I read you a poem?\n\n3:17:25.720 --> 3:17:26.980\n Oh, okay.\n\n3:17:29.580 --> 3:17:32.280\n Let's end our conversation in a poem.\n\n3:17:32.280 --> 3:17:33.220\n I love it.\n\n3:17:33.220 --> 3:17:37.480\n It's by Pierce, by Shelley,\n\n3:17:37.480 --> 3:17:39.520\n probably mispronouncing the name.\n\n3:17:39.520 --> 3:17:40.360\n But I think you'll get it.\n\n3:17:40.360 --> 3:17:41.200\n There's no right way to pronounce anything.\n\n3:17:41.200 --> 3:17:42.320\n Thank you, thank you.\n\n3:17:44.200 --> 3:17:45.820\n I'm Ozymandias.\n\n3:17:45.820 --> 3:17:49.200\n I met a traveler from an antique land who said,\n\n3:17:49.200 --> 3:17:54.120\n \"'Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert.\n\n3:17:54.120 --> 3:17:57.440\n Near them, on the sand, half sunk,\n\n3:17:57.440 --> 3:18:01.920\n a shattered visage lies whose frown and wrinkled lip\n\n3:18:01.920 --> 3:18:05.760\n and sneer of cold command tell that its sculptor,\n\n3:18:05.760 --> 3:18:09.360\n well those passions read, which yet survive,\n\n3:18:09.360 --> 3:18:11.880\n stamped on these lifeless things,\n\n3:18:11.880 --> 3:18:15.120\n the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.\n\n3:18:15.120 --> 3:18:18.300\n And on the pedestal, these words appear.\n\n3:18:18.300 --> 3:18:21.960\n My name is Ozymandias, king of kings.\n\n3:18:21.960 --> 3:18:25.320\n Look on my works, ye mighty, in despair.\n\n3:18:25.320 --> 3:18:27.760\n Nothing beside remains around the decay\n\n3:18:27.760 --> 3:18:31.080\n of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,\n\n3:18:31.080 --> 3:18:34.560\n the lone and level sands stretch far away.\"\n\n3:18:34.560 --> 3:18:39.560\n All gone, behold the king.\n\n3:18:42.080 --> 3:18:45.680\n Look on my works, ye mighty, in despair.\n\n3:18:45.680 --> 3:18:47.440\n In despair.\n\n3:18:47.440 --> 3:18:50.680\n Even though it will be forgotten in the sands of time,\n\n3:18:50.680 --> 3:18:53.600\n Duncan, I'm just so glad that you exist\n\n3:18:53.600 --> 3:18:55.560\n and you put so much love into the world\n\n3:18:55.560 --> 3:18:57.560\n over the past many years that I've gotten a chance\n\n3:18:57.560 --> 3:18:59.440\n to enjoy it by being your fan.\n\n3:18:59.440 --> 3:19:00.360\n Likewise.\n\n3:19:00.360 --> 3:19:02.800\n Thank you so much for continuing that\n\n3:19:02.800 --> 3:19:04.720\n and for sharing a bit of love with me today.\n\n3:19:04.720 --> 3:19:05.880\n Can we be friends?\n\n3:19:05.880 --> 3:19:06.720\n Let's be friends.\n\n3:19:06.720 --> 3:19:09.320\n In the real world, in 3D space?\n\n3:19:09.320 --> 3:19:12.080\n Nothing is real, but yes, in this particular slice\n\n3:19:12.080 --> 3:19:14.560\n of the multidimensional world we live in.\n\n3:19:14.560 --> 3:19:16.160\n It will be an honor and a pleasure.\n\n3:19:16.160 --> 3:19:17.480\n Thank you for having me on your show.\n\n3:19:17.480 --> 3:19:18.300\n I love you, Duncan.\n\n3:19:18.300 --> 3:19:19.140\n I love you.\n\n3:19:19.140 --> 3:19:20.560\n Thank you, Lex.\n\n3:19:20.560 --> 3:19:22.080\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:23.320\n with Duncan Trussell.\n\n3:19:23.320 --> 3:19:24.520\n To support this podcast,\n\n3:19:24.520 --> 3:19:27.340\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n3:19:27.340 --> 3:19:29.520\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n3:19:29.520 --> 3:19:31.240\n from Duncan Trussell himself.\n\n3:19:31.240 --> 3:19:35.640\n You are essentially just a cloud of atoms\n\n3:19:35.640 --> 3:19:39.120\n that will eventually be aerosolized by time.\n\n3:19:39.120 --> 3:20:04.120\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
