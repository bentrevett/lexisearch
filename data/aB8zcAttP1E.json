  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:05.700\n The following is a conversation with Commander David Fravor, who was a Navy pilot for 18 years\n\n00:05.700 --> 00:12.060\n and commander of the Strike Fighter Squadron 41, also known as the Black Aces, a squadron\n\n00:12.060 --> 00:15.420\n of 12 airplanes consisting of several hundred people.\n\n00:15.420 --> 00:23.660\n He's also famously one of the people who with his own eyes saw and chased a UFO, an\n\n00:23.660 --> 00:30.840\n identified flying object in 2004 that is referred to as the Tic Tac and the incident more formally\n\n00:30.840 --> 00:35.200\n referred to as the USS Nimitz UFO incident.\n\n00:35.200 --> 00:40.800\n His story, corroborated by several other pilots from my perspective as a curious scientist\n\n00:40.800 --> 00:47.280\n and an open minded human being, is the most credible sighting of a UFO in history, at\n\n00:47.280 --> 00:49.440\n least that I'm aware of.\n\n00:49.440 --> 00:53.520\n He's a humble, fascinating, and fun human being to talk to.\n\n00:53.520 --> 00:58.320\n I put out a call for questions on Reddit and many other places and tried to ask as many\n\n00:58.320 --> 01:01.160\n of the questions that people posted as I could.\n\n01:01.160 --> 01:06.440\n And overall, I really enjoyed this conversation and I'm sure if the world wants us to, and\n\n01:06.440 --> 01:10.880\n if there's more questions to be had, we'll talk on this podcast again.\n\n01:10.880 --> 01:16.160\n Quick summary of the sponsors, Athletic Greens, ExpressVPN, and BetterHelp.\n\n01:16.160 --> 01:21.720\n Please check out the sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n01:21.720 --> 01:27.840\n As a side note, let me say that the world of UFOs and UAPs, unidentified aerial phenomena,\n\n01:27.840 --> 01:33.280\n and aliens in general is foreign to me because of the high ratio of outlandish conspiracy\n\n01:33.280 --> 01:36.760\n theorists to actual hard evidence.\n\n01:36.760 --> 01:41.640\n I'm a scientist first and foremost, but an open minded one, often looking and thinking\n\n01:41.640 --> 01:43.000\n outside the box.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:47.680\n I'm often disheartened by the closed mindedness of the scientific community.\n\n01:47.680 --> 01:52.920\n And in equal part, I'm disheartened by the lack of rigor and basic scientific inquiry\n\n01:52.920 --> 01:56.760\n and study on the part of the conspiracy theorists.\n\n01:56.760 --> 02:02.040\n I believe there's a line somewhere between the two extremes that more inquisitive minds\n\n02:02.040 --> 02:03.800\n should walk.\n\n02:03.800 --> 02:09.080\n I think we humans know very little about our world, what's up there among the stars and\n\n02:09.080 --> 02:14.240\n the nature of reality and the nature of our very own minds.\n\n02:14.240 --> 02:17.640\n The path to understanding can only be walked humbly.\n\n02:17.640 --> 02:22.880\n The very idea that there is a possibility that David witnessed a piece of technology,\n\n02:22.880 --> 02:28.140\n whether human made or alien made, that moved in the way it did, should be inspiring to\n\n02:28.140 --> 02:31.220\n every scientist and engineer on this earth.\n\n02:31.220 --> 02:35.880\n There may be propulsion and energy systems yet to be discovered that, once understood\n\n02:35.880 --> 02:41.280\n and mastered, will put distant galaxies within reach of us human beings.\n\n02:41.280 --> 02:47.400\n Paradigm shifts in science and leaps in understanding can only happen, I think, if we open our eyes\n\n02:47.400 --> 02:52.920\n and allow ourselves to dream, to think from first principles, and remove the constraints\n\n02:52.920 --> 02:59.480\n and innovation placed on us by the scientific conventions and assumptions of prior generations.\n\n02:59.480 --> 03:04.320\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review it with 5 Stars on Apple Podcast, follow\n\n03:04.320

podcast.\n\n03:31.240 --> 03:36.200\n This show is brought to you by Athletic Greens, the all in one daily drink to support health\n\n03:36.200 --> 03:37.200\n and performance.\n\n03:37.200 --> 03:41.800\n I drink it every day to make sure I'm not missing any of the nutrition I need.\n\n03:41.800 --> 03:45.640\n Now let me take a hard left turn and talk about fasting.\n\n03:45.640 --> 03:51.720\n I fast often, sometimes intermittent fasting of 16 hours and then an 8 hour eating period\n\n03:51.720 --> 03:57.080\n of 2 meals, sometimes 24 hours, that's one dinner to the next.\n\n03:57.080 --> 04:01.640\n I've been even considering doing a 48 or 72 hour fast that some people I look up to\n\n04:01.640 --> 04:03.040\n have done.\n\n04:03.040 --> 04:07.080\n People who have done it tell me that outside of weight loss and the different health benefits,\n\n04:07.080 --> 04:11.460\n it's a chance to meditate on the finiteness of life.\n\n04:11.460 --> 04:16.800\n Not eating somehow is a reminder that we're immortal, that every day is precious.\n\n04:16.800 --> 04:21.840\n I certainly experienced this with the 24 hour fast and I think it goes even deeper for the\n\n04:21.840 --> 04:25.760\n 48, 72, and even week long fasts.\n\n04:25.760 --> 04:30.920\n Anyway, I always break my fast with Athletic Greens, it's delicious, refreshing, just makes\n\n04:30.920

expressvpn.com slash lexpod to get a discount.\n\n04:53.340 --> 04:56.880\n You probably know there's a show called The Office that I fell in love with, first with\n\n04:56.880 --> 05:02.400\n the British version with Ricky Gervais and then the American version with Steve Carell.\n\n05:02.400 --> 05:07.360\n ExpressVPN lets you pretend your location is somewhere else, choosing from nearly 100\n\n05:07.360 --> 05:11.320\n different countries and then watch one of the nine totally different other versions\n\n05:11.320 --> 05:14.360\n of The Office in other countries.\n\n05:14.360 --> 05:19.560\n Also it protects you when you do shady things on the internet that you shouldn't be doing.\n\n05:19.560 --> 05:24.280\n Like checking the website of this very podcast that for some reason was not available in\n\n05:24.280 --> 05:29.860\n Russia for a long time, not sure if it still is, but if it isn't you can use ExpressVPN\n\n05:29.860 --> 05:31.000\n to access it.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:37.280\n I think of ExpressVPN like a pirate ship, and regular VPN free life as a boring cruise\n\n05:37.280 --> 05:41.120\n from one place to another with no excitement in between.\n\n05:41.120

and trying to get an airplane\n\n06:00.800 --> 06:02.120\n to notice you.\n\n06:02.120 --> 06:04.920\n Check it out at betterhelp.com slash lex.\n\n06:04.920 --> 06:08.280\n They figure out what you need and match you with a licensed professional therapist and\n\n06:08.280 --> 06:13.840\n under 48 hours you can communicate by text anytime and schedule weekly audio and video\n\n06:13.840 --> 06:14.840\n sessions.\n\n06:14.840 --> 06:18.840\n Now, hard left turn, let me talk about desert islands.\n\n06:18.840 --> 06:23.040\n Whatever you think of it, I love the movie Cast Away with Tom Hanks and the idea of spending\n\n06:23.040 --> 06:27.120\n time on an island, alone, with potentially no hope.\n\n06:27.120 --> 06:31.640\n The natural question is, if I could, what would I bring to this island?\n\n06:31.640 --> 06:36.080\n The answer is complicated, but let me pick one thing, the first thing that popped into\n\n06:36.080 --> 06:41.920\n my crazy mind which is the Introduction to Algorithms book, also called CLRS for the\n\n06:41.920 --> 06:44.840\n first letters of the last name of its four authors.\n\n06:44.840 --> 06:50.480\n I find algorithms beautiful, like a little toolbox for a simple world inside computers\n\n06:50.480 --> 06:55.080\n when the real world outside is an impossible chaotic mess.\n\n06:55.080 --> 06:59.720\n I would love pondering the puzzles in that book for months, far away from human civilization.\n\n06:59.720 --> 07:06.240\n Anyway, check out BetterHelp at betterhelp.com slash lex to get a discount and to support\n\n07:06.240 --> 07:07.920\n this podcast.\n\n07:07.920 --> 07:13.840\n And now, finally, here's my conversation with David Fravor.\n\n07:13.840 --> 07:17.480\n You're a graduate of the Navy Fighter Weapons School.\n\n07:17.480 --> 07:18.880\n Yeah, I am.\n\n07:18.880 --> 07:20.400\n Better known as Top Gun.\n\n07:20.400 --> 07:21.400\n Yeah.\n\n07:21.400 --> 07:26.280\n Let me ask the most ridiculous question, how realistic is the movie Top Gun?\n\n07:26.280 --> 07:31.400\n So it's funny, we used to joke, and a friend of mine who was a Top Gun instructor said\n\n07:31.400 --> 07:36.400\n this, there's two things in the original Top Gun that are true, that are very realistic.\n\n07:36.400 --> 07:43.240\n One, there is a place called Top Gun, and number two is they do fly airplanes there.\n\n07:43.240 --> 07:50.720\n Other than that, I went through in 97, class 497, and there's actually a log of every single\n\n07:50.720 --> 07:53.960\n person that's went through, kind of like a SEAL training.\n\n07:53.960 --> 07:54.960\n There's a list.\n\n07:54.960 --> 07:57.600\n Because there's a lot of posers out there, oh, I was a Navy SEAL.\n\n07:57.600 --> 07:58.600\n No, you weren't.\n\n07:58.600 --> 07:59.600\n Well, I went to Top Gun.\n\n07:59.600 --> 08:03.240\n You can actually go to Top Gun, and matter of fact, just to get a Top Gun patch, the\n\n08:03.240 --> 08:07.080\n real patch, you have to have gone there.\n\n08:07.080 --> 08:11.560\n So a lot of the patches you see running around are not real.\n\n08:11.560 --> 08:13.200\n The real ones are controlled.\n\n08:13.200 --> 08:16.200\n The people that make them honor that.\n\n08:16.200 --> 08:17.920\n And when you go in, they look up your name.\n\n08:17.920 --> 08:19.360\n If you want to get one, they look up your name.\n\n08:19.360 --> 08:21.200\n You just tell them, they go, okay, here, and they'll sell them to you.\n\n08:21.200 --> 08:24.720\n If you are not on the list, you ain't get no patch.\n\n08:24.720 --> 08:31.380\n Because it is, it's a pretty big deal to go through, but for me, probably one of the best\n\n08:31.380 --> 08:36.240\n experiences of flying, because everyone there is extremely competent.\n\n08:36.240 --> 08:41.600\n It's very, very challenging, but it's what we all signed up to do.\n\n08:41.600 --> 08:49.520\n So it's, it's just the entire group that is, when you want to be that, you know, that level,\n\n08:49.520 --> 08:53.280\n you know, where you go, everyone really cares, and everyone really wants to be good.\n\n08:53.280 --> 08:54.280\n Is it competitive?\n\n08:54.280 --> 08:56.000\n Like, what was it, in the movie?\n\n08:56.000 --> 09:00.640\n No, it's, when you go through, it's, you know, it's, if anything, it's more of the\n\n09:00.640 --> 09:04.520\n students, you know, and then there's the instructor side, then the instructor sides are really,\n\n09:04.520 --> 09:09.120\n you know, they're guys that, you know, they just chose to stay up in Fallon.\n\n09:09.120 --> 09:15.480\n And it's extremely difficult job, because they have, they have a very small tolerance\n\n09:15.480 --> 09:20.420\n for not being good.\n\n09:20.420 --> 09:24.360\n So they're briefs, the guys when they give a lecture, so let's just say there's a fighter\n\n09:24.360 --> 09:26.200\n employment lecture, which is one of the hardest ones.\n\n09:26.200 --> 09:30.040\n It takes about two days to give the fighter employment lecture.\n\n09:30.040 --> 09:33.560\n The guy who gives the lecture goes through multiple, what they call them murder boards,\n\n09:33.560 --> 09:37.420\n where he's scrutinized by his peers, and he practices, by the time they actually stand\n\n09:37.420 --> 09:43.600\n in front of a class, they pretty much have their 250 PowerPoint slides memorized, and\n\n09:43.600 --> 09:46.760\n they don't even turn around, they just click and they know them in order.\n\n09:46.760 --> 09:50.760\n And they repeat the same thing over, it's, and it's standardized.\n\n09:50.760 --> 09:53.760\n So they are extremely, extremely standardized when you go through the school, and there's\n\n09:53.760 --> 09:58.000\n a reason for that, because what they're doing is they're training, so when you come out\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:01.560\n of Top Gun, you're called a Strike Fighter Weapons and Tactics Instructor, okay?\n\n10:01.560 --> 10:03.940\n So you're SFTI.\n\n10:03.940 --> 10:07.480\n When you come out of that, your job is to go usually to one of the weapons schools on\n\n10:07.480 --> 10:11.560\n the East or West Coast and train the fleet squadrons, and then you visit the squadrons\n\n10:11.560 --> 10:13.480\n and train and do upgrade rides and all that.\n\n10:13.480 --> 10:19.440\n So there's a, there's a reason that they are extremely particular when you go through the\n\n10:19.440 --> 10:20.440\n course.\n\n10:20.440 --> 10:23.800\n It's, it is literally one of the best things, and it's not, it's not a rank based thing,\n\n10:23.800 --> 10:30.480\n just think, oh, Navy, you can come in as a, you know, like an 04 Lieutenant Commander.\n\n10:30.480 --> 10:34.440\n The lieutenants, the hierarchy, or at least to be, I don't know how it is exactly today,\n\n10:34.440 --> 10:36.280\n but I imagine it's the same.\n\n10:36.280 --> 10:40.460\n The hierarchy is actually based on seniority at the school, not necessarily rank.\n\n10:40.460 --> 10:45.920\n So when the tactical decisions are made, which are based on fact and trying things out in\n\n10:45.920 --> 10:52.520\n the Fallon Ranges, they set the top X number of folks that have been there seniority wise,\n\n10:52.520 --> 10:56.440\n and I mean time wise, are the ones that actually make the decision.\n\n10:56.440 --> 11:01.240\n And when the door, you may not agree, but when the door opens and everyone comes out\n\n11:01.240 --> 11:05.000\n from the staff, they all speak the same language.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:09.680\n It's and it has to be that way, which is why the school has been so effective since it\n\n11:09.680 --> 11:11.120\n was founded.\n\n11:11.120 --> 11:14.120\n So it's just a, it's an incredible group of individuals.\n\n11:14.120 --> 11:19.720\n So there's a bar of excellence that, that the instructors demand.\n\n11:19.720 --> 11:22.760\n Oh, very much so, and they're held to it.\n\n11:22.760 --> 11:26.440\n So it's not a, hey, I'm now an instructor, so I can do what I want.\n\n11:26.440 --> 11:29.960\n There is a standard and they have to live up to that standard.\n\n11:29.960 --> 11:33.720\n They have to, and I mean every moment of every day.\n\n11:33.720 --> 11:37.260\n So if they go someplace, if they go from Fallon and they come down and do, they're called\n\n11:37.260 --> 11:40.200\n site visits where they come down and they'll come to Lemoore, California, which is where\n\n11:40.200 --> 11:42.780\n the West Coast Fighter Wing is at for the Navy.\n\n11:42.780 --> 11:47.880\n And they go around and start flying sorties with the fleet squadrons to kind of pass on\n\n11:47.880 --> 11:51.000\n some of that knowledge, that's that same high level of standard.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:55.200\n It's they can't just drop your guard because you wear the Top Gun patch.\n\n11:55.200 --> 11:56.200\n And people know that.\n\n11:56.200 --> 11:57.200\n And they wear light blue shirts.\n\n11:57.200 --> 12:00.240\n So it's pretty easy to identify them when they're out there.\n\n12:00.240 --> 12:02.800\n And you know, and then everyone else who's been through the school, including them, have\n\n12:02.800 --> 12:04.060\n the patch on their sleeve.\n\n12:04.060 --> 12:07.060\n So there's a standard that's expected when you come out of there.\n\n12:07.060 --> 12:10.160\n So you were a Navy pilot for 18 years.\n\n12:10.160 --> 12:11.160\n Yes.\n\n12:11.160 --> 12:15.720\n Can you briefly tell the story of your career as a pilot?\n\n12:15.720 --> 12:16.720\n Yeah.\n\n12:16.720 --> 12:21.200\n So, you know, first I was in, I was enlisted, I was a Marine.\n\n12:21.200 --> 12:27.580\n And then the Marines actually sent me, recommended me to go to the Naval Academy.\n\n12:27.580 --> 12:29.220\n So it's always better to be lucky than good.\n\n12:29.220 --> 12:33.280\n But I got to go to the Naval Academy and I finished and I've had that dream to fly.\n\n12:33.280 --> 12:34.280\n So when I got selected,\n\n12:34.280 --> 12:36.280\n You've always dreamed of flying.\n\n12:36.280 --> 12:37.280\n Yeah.\n\n12:37.280 --> 12:41.200\n Since 1969, when I watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.\n\n12:41.200 --> 12:46.680\n I was at that point, I asked my mom, I remember watching it, I was just prior to being five.\n\n12:46.680 --> 12:50.960\n And I said, wow, yeah, it's so cool, mom.\n\n12:50.960 --> 12:53.400\n And she said, well, you know, they were all pilots.\n\n12:53.400 --> 12:56.480\n And then at that point it was like, I'm going to be a pilot.\n\n12:56.480 --> 13:01.200\n And if you knew me growing up, cause I was a little bit of a delinquent, people are just\n\n13:01.200 --> 13:02.200\n like, yeah, right.\n\n13:02.200 --> 13:07.120\n I used to joke, I'm going to fly, I'm going to fly jets, I'm going to drop bombs.\n\n13:07.120 --> 13:10.080\n And if people that knew me as a kid, they'd be like, yeah, and they'd be like, ah, not\n\n13:10.080 --> 13:11.080\n a chance.\n\n13:11.080 --> 13:15.800\n And then when I did, I actually had a, it's a funny story and I'll get to it, I'll finish\n\n13:15.800 --> 13:16.800\n my career.\n\n13:16.800 --> 13:21.280\n But I was at my cousin's wedding and we all grew up in the same neighborhood.\n\n13:21.280 --> 13:24.680\n We kind of, they had Italian side of the family.\n\n13:24.680 --> 13:25.680\n That's how we grew up.\n\n13:25.680 --> 13:26.680\n So it was my house right down the street.\n\n13:26.680 --> 13:27.680\n It was my cousin, Chad.\n\n13:27.680 --> 13:31.320\n And then right around the corner is my cousin Ray and my aunts and uncles and stuff.\n\n13:31.320 --> 13:34.280\n The guy two doors down from my house, the paper boy in the neighborhood, so they all\n\n13:34.280 --> 13:35.280\n knew me.\n\n13:35.280 --> 13:40.600\n And I went to my cousin's wedding and Mr. Race looks at me and he says, David Fravor.\n\n13:40.600 --> 13:42.480\n I go, Mr. Race, how you doing?\n\n13:42.480 --> 13:44.800\n He goes, you fly jets, Top Gun and all that.\n\n13:44.800 --> 13:45.800\n I go, yes, sir.\n\n13:45.800 --> 13:48.600\n He goes, man, I figured you'd be in jail by now.\n\n13:48.600 --> 13:54.040\n And it was kind of a, to me, it was a little bit of a badge of honor going on and I kind\n\n13:54.040 --> 13:55.040\n of overcame that.\n\n13:55.040 --> 13:56.040\n But...\n\n13:56.040 --> 13:57.200\n What do you attribute that to?\n\n13:57.200 --> 14:02.760\n So you, I've heard you before and just now say that it's better to be lucky than good\n\n14:02.760 --> 14:13.040\n and you talk modestly about just being lucky, but if you were to describe your trajectory\n\n14:13.040 --> 14:21.160\n maybe in a way of advice, like retrospectively, how'd you pull it off to be like, to be truly\n\n14:21.160 --> 14:23.120\n a special person?\n\n14:23.120 --> 14:26.680\n The easiest way is one, never, never take no.\n\n14:26.680 --> 14:30.160\n Don't let anyone put you down and say you can't do it or those.\n\n14:30.160 --> 14:34.780\n I mean, I knew, I knew what I was capable of inside, you know, and if I really believe\n\n14:34.780 --> 14:39.500\n if you want something and you want to do something, then you can achieve it.\n\n14:39.500 --> 14:45.080\n Not in all cases, like if I loved basketball and I really wanted to be in the NBA, there's\n\n14:45.080 --> 14:49.200\n a realism that says I'm five foot eight and I got like a really short vertical leap and\n\n14:49.200 --> 14:51.680\n I'm really not that good at basketball, it's probably not ever going to happen no matter\n\n14:51.680 --> 14:53.440\n how hard I try and practice.\n\n14:53.440 --> 14:54.440\n It's just the way it is.\n\n14:54.440 --> 15:02.000\n Or for me to be in the NFL, I'm not fast, you know, I'm not that big, it's just physically\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.640\n I'm incapable of doing that.\n\n15:04.640 --> 15:09.160\n But there's things that don't really tie to a true physical ability as far as size and\n\n15:09.160 --> 15:15.040\n strength, but it's, it's mental and I'm not saying you have to be a genius and super smart\n\n15:15.040 --> 15:16.040\n to be a fighter pilot.\n\n15:16.040 --> 15:17.420\n Matter of fact, you don't.\n\n15:17.420 --> 15:23.480\n It really comes down to the ability to think very quickly, 80% solution is typically good\n\n15:23.480 --> 15:28.240\n enough because if you overthink it, you're, you're behind and then in an air to air fight,\n\n15:28.240 --> 15:29.240\n that's what happens.\n\n15:29.240 --> 15:32.840\n People try and overthink it and before you know it, because it's happening so fast, you\n\n15:32.840 --> 15:37.560\n don't have, you can't get to the nth degree, you know, six decimal places, 80% solution\n\n15:37.560 --> 15:38.560\n is good enough.\n\n15:38.560 --> 15:42.680\n You have a really strong gut for the 80% solution, just yeah, I'm a big believer in the 80% solution.\n\n15:42.680 --> 15:43.680\n I love that.\n\n15:43.680 --> 15:48.280\n If you get 80% you can go and then you can always adjust, which is exactly what, like\n\n15:48.280 --> 15:52.600\n if you're fighting in BFM, the 80% solution is it's like a chess game, but it's a really,\n\n15:52.600 --> 15:58.040\n really fast chess game where you go, I'm doing this and then I know that if I do a maneuver,\n\n15:58.040 --> 16:03.120\n if he's going to counter it correctly, he should do a, if he doesn't do a, he does some\n\n16:03.120 --> 16:09.860\n degree less like BCD and then I know how bad his, his error is and then I capitalize.\n\n16:09.860 --> 16:12.800\n So my mind, I don't have to be perfect, you know, I don't have to go, I need to go to\n\n16:12.800 --> 16:14.560\n 47 degrees, nose high.\n\n16:14.560 --> 16:18.120\n If I just kind of get above 40, then I'm good and I can watch how it reacts and then I can\n\n16:18.120 --> 16:19.120\n adjust for that.\n\n16:19.120 --> 16:24.420\n And you, and you continually work that problem and you chip away because if you start neutral,\n\n16:24.420 --> 16:29.280\n you're just basically chipping away and gaining advantage, advantage, advantage till eventually,\n\n16:29.280 --> 16:33.040\n you know, and if you're really, you know, fighting, you know, just guns only rear quarter\n\n16:33.040 --> 16:38.120\n where you got to get behind the guy, kind of world war II dog fight and type stuff.\n\n16:38.120 --> 16:43.880\n Then it's, it's literally, it's a, it's a very, very fast chess game that happens at,\n\n16:43.880 --> 16:46.320\n you know, 400 knots, 300 knots depends.\n\n16:46.320 --> 16:53.160\n So to get to be one of the rare individuals that are able to do that, he just had the\n\n16:53.160 --> 16:56.040\n dream and didn't take no for an answer.\n\n16:56.040 --> 16:57.040\n Yeah.\n\n16:57.040 --> 17:02.840\n Well, you know, you know, part of it is family, you know, my dad was, I used to call him a\n\n17:02.840 --> 17:07.680\n fire ready aim guy, you know, he'd smack me and then asked me what I did wrong.\n\n17:07.680 --> 17:08.680\n Yeah.\n\n17:08.680 --> 17:09.680\n Good parenting.\n\n17:09.680 --> 17:13.440\n Um, back then, you know, I, I joke and people look, cause you know, at times it was kind\n\n17:13.440 --> 17:17.440\n of tough, you know, cause he can be pretty demanding, but on the other side, you know,\n\n17:17.440 --> 17:20.320\n I probably needed to be reined in a little bit at times.\n\n17:20.320 --> 17:24.240\n Uh, but then everyone else in my family, you know, my mom was really awesome when I was\n\n17:24.240 --> 17:25.240\n a kid.\n\n17:25.240 --> 17:29.700\n Uh, my, uh, my grandfather who is a big, big part of it.\n\n17:29.700 --> 17:35.560\n My mom's dad, uh, who he taught me a lot and you have a question there that we'll talk\n\n17:35.560 --> 17:39.480\n about, uh, about him, but, uh, huge, huge influence.\n\n17:39.480 --> 17:40.480\n Very, very positive.\n\n17:40.480 --> 17:45.720\n And a lot of the stuff that I do today and decisions are based on things that he taught\n\n17:45.720 --> 17:46.720\n me.\n\n17:46.720 --> 17:51.320\n Um, and, uh, you know, and I figured, you know, it was the first funeral I ever went\n\n17:51.320 --> 17:57.160\n to and it was, uh, it was about three miles long and church was overfilling and people\n\n17:57.160 --> 17:58.160\n were out.\n\n17:58.160 --> 18:00.240\n It was a big guy, dead serious.\n\n18:00.240 --> 18:02.520\n And you go, there's someone asked who died the Pope.\n\n18:02.520 --> 18:05.440\n Um, uh, so, so a lot of people love them.\n\n18:05.440 --> 18:09.600\n So back to, back to my career question, cause I'm getting down at rabbit hole.\n\n18:09.600 --> 18:13.080\n Uh, no, I, when I was at the, I was going to, I was going to stay in the Marines.\n\n18:13.080 --> 18:14.600\n I really wanted to go, man.\n\n18:14.600 --> 18:15.600\n I love the core.\n\n18:15.600 --> 18:20.440\n I think it's, uh, of all services, it's that one, everything is in a ball and they're very,\n\n18:20.440 --> 18:24.400\n very professional and it was a great, great organization to join.\n\n18:24.400 --> 18:30.120\n Uh, but I went out to the Nimitz on my, uh, freshman cruise after your freshman year at\n\n18:30.120 --> 18:33.080\n the Naval Academy, you go out on a ship and you, you're an enlisted person.\n\n18:33.080 --> 18:35.640\n You get to experience that half when I already was enlisted.\n\n18:35.640 --> 18:36.640\n So it was fine with me.\n\n18:36.640 --> 18:37.640\n Because it comes up a lot.\n\n18:37.640 --> 18:41.320\n You mind saying what the Nimitz is, what a ship is, what like, yeah.\n\n18:41.320 --> 18:43.640\n So Nimitz is, uh, an aircraft carrier.\n\n18:43.640 --> 18:48.200\n So it's, uh, four and a half acres of sovereign us territory that floats around the us oceans\n\n18:48.200 --> 18:49.200\n giant thing.\n\n18:49.200 --> 18:50.840\n Does it have weapons on it?\n\n18:50.840 --> 18:52.780\n Uh, the air wing is really the weapons.\n\n18:52.780 --> 18:58.040\n It does have defensive weapons, but for the most part it's a giant moving airport is what\n\n18:58.040 --> 18:59.040\n it is.\n\n18:59.040 --> 19:01.760\n So I was out there watching the airplanes land and take off.\n\n19:01.760 --> 19:06.040\n Um, and I'm like, Oh, and the squadrons that were out there, one of the squadrons was a\n\n19:06.040 --> 19:12.480\n VF 41 and a 14 squadron, VF 84, uh, an F 14 squadron and then a couple of a six squadrons.\n\n19:12.480 --> 19:15.800\n And we actually ended up part pairing up and hanging out with some of the a six pilots\n\n19:15.800 --> 19:16.800\n and BNs.\n\n19:16.800 --> 19:17.800\n So it was really a neat experience.\n\n19:17.800 --> 19:20.800\n And I said, I want to do that.\n\n19:20.800 --> 19:25.160\n And the way to do it was to not, to, to go in the Navy because there are Marine squadrons\n\n19:25.160 --> 19:28.680\n that go out to the aircraft carriers, but most of them are land based, you know, to\n\n19:28.680 --> 19:29.680\n support the Marines.\n\n19:29.680 --> 19:33.580\n Cause there are that, that unit, that whole unit, you know, the Marine Corps is that one\n\n19:33.580 --> 19:35.480\n surface has it all.\n\n19:35.480 --> 19:41.480\n And, um, so when I graduated and I got to, uh, you know, I, I worked hard through primary\n\n19:41.480 --> 19:45.720\n and that's where, you know, I knew Missy, uh, we were in, actually went through together,\n\n19:45.720 --> 19:50.120\n Missy Cummings, uh, we went through primary together and then, uh, I went to Kingsville.\n\n19:50.120 --> 19:51.200\n We all selected the same time.\n\n19:51.200 --> 19:52.200\n I went to Kingsville.\n\n19:52.200 --> 19:55.600\n There was another guy, Scott Weidemeyer, uh, the three of us.\n\n19:55.600 --> 20:00.160\n So I went to Kingsville, Scott went to Beeville and Missy went to Meridian.\n\n20:00.160 --> 20:04.120\n So the three of us that we had all went through, we got, we selected out of primary together.\n\n20:04.120 --> 20:08.160\n We all ended up going jets and that's, that's how, besides from school, I knew her at school\n\n20:08.160 --> 20:09.160\n too.\n\n20:09.160 --> 20:10.160\n The long story.\n\n20:10.160 --> 20:11.160\n I got done, uh, got winged.\n\n20:11.160 --> 20:14.600\n It took me two years to the day from the time I graduated the Naval Academy until I got\n\n20:14.600 --> 20:21.440\n my wings and, uh, through some luck, uh, I ended up getting A6s, uh, on the West coast,\n\n20:21.440 --> 20:23.360\n which is a side by side, uh, bomber.\n\n20:23.360 --> 20:26.320\n So it's a pilot on the left seat and the Bombardier navigators on the right seat.\n\n20:26.320 --> 20:28.320\n It was built in the sixties.\n\n20:28.320 --> 20:33.200\n It is all weather, uh, and it flies low at night and it's got a terrain mapping radar.\n\n20:33.200 --> 20:38.900\n How many, I guess, is that a good term to use fighter jets as a broad category for,\n\n20:38.900 --> 20:39.900\n for the public?\n\n20:39.900 --> 20:40.900\n Yeah, that's fine.\n\n20:40.900 --> 20:43.360\n How many fighter jets are side by side like that?\n\n20:43.360 --> 20:47.960\n That was, uh, in the Navy, that was the only one, uh, the Air Force, the F111 was a side\n\n20:47.960 --> 20:52.560\n by side, but the Navy, it was the A6 and then there's the EA6B, which is a derivative of\n\n20:52.560 --> 20:53.560\n that.\n\n20:53.560 --> 20:56.560\n And now that those are all gone, the EA6B is just went away a few years ago.\n\n20:56.560 --> 21:01.880\n And now the, uh, E18G Growler, um, is the replacement for the A6B.\n\n21:01.880 --> 21:04.960\n There was never a replacement for the A6, uh, that I flew.\n\n21:04.960 --> 21:10.400\n It really became the F18, which, uh, the A6 could go quite a bit further distance wise\n\n21:10.400 --> 21:16.040\n by fuel, uh, then the Hornet and, uh, the Hornet is the F18.\n\n21:16.040 --> 21:21.120\n Is there usually two people in the plane, but they're usually like in front and behind?\n\n21:21.120 --> 21:22.840\n In a, the modern two seaters, yes.\n\n21:22.840 --> 21:26.320\n Uh, but most of the tactical airplanes in the world today are single seat.\n\n21:26.320 --> 21:27.980\n Single seat, just one person?\n\n21:27.980 --> 21:32.400\n One person, with the exception of, I'll probably, someone will yell at me, but really with the\n\n21:32.400 --> 21:37.880\n exception of the F15E Strike Eagle and the F18F Super Hornet, which is the F is a two\n\n21:37.880 --> 21:42.440\n seater and the G is also a two seater, but it's more of an electronic attack by say full\n\n21:42.440 --> 21:44.400\n up fighter bomber.\n\n21:44.400 --> 21:51.560\n So most of the time that you've flown in your, like I said, 18 year career is, was it two\n\n21:51.560 --> 21:52.560\n seater?\n\n21:52.560 --> 21:53.560\n That was about half and half.\n\n21:53.560 --> 21:55.940\n So I started off in A6 was a two seater.\n\n21:55.940 --> 22:03.400\n Then I went to single seat F18s and I flew those, uh, all the way up until 2000 and let\n\n22:03.400 --> 22:07.800\n me think 2001 to the end of 2001.\n\n22:07.800 --> 22:11.120\n And then I shifted over and started flying the Super Hornets and I've flown both of those,\n\n22:11.120 --> 22:16.720\n the E's and the S, but I deployed when I had command of VFA 41, I had the two seat, they\n\n22:16.720 --> 22:18.040\n were F squadron.\n\n22:18.040 --> 22:25.920\n So you eventually ended up commanding the, the Strike Fighter Squadron 41.\n\n22:25.920 --> 22:28.920\n I love the, the name, the Black Aces.\n\n22:28.920 --> 22:35.560\n What, uh, is there some parts of that journey that are amazing, parts of it that are tough\n\n22:35.560 --> 22:37.000\n that kind of stand out?\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.640\n To me, it was one, it was a huge honor.\n\n22:39.640 --> 22:44.880\n Uh, and I got to serve with, uh, you know, I got pulled up because the, the guy, the,\n\n22:44.880 --> 22:47.840\n the people that are exos, cause we fleet up, you go from the number two guy to the number\n\n22:47.840 --> 22:49.000\n one guy.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.400\n So the XO becomes the CEO.\n\n22:50.400 --> 22:53.200\n So the executive officer becomes the commanding officer.\n\n22:53.200 --> 23:00.400\n So I had worked with, uh, now soon to be vice Admiral Weitzel, uh, was the, he was commander\n\n23:00.400 --> 23:04.840\n Weitzel at the time was the XO and he really wanted, because he knew there was a little\n\n23:04.840 --> 23:10.400\n bit of a problem when the Super Hornets came into L'more, L'more had been a single seat,\n\n23:10.400 --> 23:16.100\n a fighter community, uh, since the forever.\n\n23:16.100 --> 23:19.860\n And now all of a sudden you've got the F18F coming in, which has the weapon systems operators\n\n23:19.860 --> 23:23.480\n in the back that are not pilots, they're weapon systems operators.\n\n23:23.480 --> 23:24.760\n And there's a difference.\n\n23:24.760 --> 23:31.360\n Um, and Kenny is a weapon systems operator and, uh, Kenny knew because of my A6 background\n\n23:31.360 --> 23:34.880\n that I have a switch that I can go one seat, two seat, one seat, two seat.\n\n23:34.880 --> 23:40.080\n Because when you fly two seat, there's a lot of stuff that the pilot will offload and take\n\n23:40.080 --> 23:42.680\n the advantage of the weapon systems operator.\n\n23:42.680 --> 23:47.120\n And it's not that one plus one equals two in that environment because it really, there's\n\n23:47.120 --> 23:51.840\n a huge amount of capabilities that the single seat has and the autonomy that comes for the\n\n23:51.840 --> 23:56.040\n ability to make decisions quickly and how well the airplane flies.\n\n23:56.040 --> 23:58.560\n But it does, it does equal more than one.\n\n23:58.560 --> 24:04.680\n I would say that one plus one with two people as well as a minimum of 1.5 because you've\n\n24:04.680 --> 24:09.440\n got an extra head, you've got extra eyes, you've got someone that can monitor systems.\n\n24:09.440 --> 24:11.000\n The airplanes can do two things at once.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:14.320\n I mean, there's an incredible amount of capability that we add when we do that.\n\n24:14.320 --> 24:18.960\n Can we just pause on that just for me, from like a human factors perspective and also\n\n24:18.960 --> 24:26.480\n an AI perspective, what's, how difficult, uh, so there's like when there's two people,\n\n24:26.480 --> 24:33.000\n there's also a third person that's the AI part, the some level of automation like autopilot\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\n maybe.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:35.000\n That's correct.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:39.960\n Maybe you can kind of talk about the psychology of like, you said making decisions really\n\n24:39.960 --> 24:46.360\n quick, 80%, how do you deal with another brain working with you?\n\n24:46.360 --> 24:52.260\n And then also the automation, is there an interesting interplay that you get to learn?\n\n24:52.260 --> 24:57.240\n And also as that changed throughout your career, I imagine it got, it gotten better in terms\n\n24:57.240 --> 24:59.040\n of the automation or perhaps not?\n\n24:59.040 --> 25:03.320\n Well, I can tell you, so let's, let's start just, no, this is, this is good.\n\n25:03.320 --> 25:04.320\n This is good.\n\n25:04.320 --> 25:07.280\n And this is, I'm enjoying this because now we actually get to talk about something other\n\n25:07.280 --> 25:08.280\n than a Tic Tac.\n\n25:08.280 --> 25:10.760\n So, um, so let's start with the A6.\n\n25:10.760 --> 25:15.840\n The A6 was really an analog airplane, uh, that was built in the sixties.\n\n25:15.840 --> 25:16.840\n All right.\n\n25:16.840 --> 25:21.320\n And there's been studies done on the crew coordination, which is the interaction between\n\n25:21.320 --> 25:23.720\n the pilot and the bombardier navigator.\n\n25:23.720 --> 25:26.680\n So we would fly low at night in the mountains.\n\n25:26.680 --> 25:28.960\n So I was stationed up in Whidbey Island, Washington.\n\n25:28.960 --> 25:33.160\n So you've got the Cascades and incredible amount of time.\n\n25:33.160 --> 25:37.400\n And we would get in the simulators because unlike normally people think terrain following\n\n25:37.400 --> 25:41.640\n and there's the radars, the 111, the B1 has a system like this, but it'll, the radar can\n\n25:41.640 --> 25:42.640\n see and it'll fly.\n\n25:42.640 --> 25:43.680\n It basically flies a straight line.\n\n25:43.680 --> 25:47.480\n So it goes up and over mountains and back down and up and over mountains where the A6\n\n25:47.480 --> 25:49.700\n was really manual.\n\n25:49.700 --> 25:52.360\n So you do this low level routes where you're going to, you're going to fly in the mountains\n\n25:52.360 --> 25:53.360\n at night.\n\n25:53.360 --> 25:56.920\n You're going to be at, you know, 500 to a thousand feet above the ground, ripping through\n\n25:56.920 --> 26:00.600\n like fog layers, cause you don't need to see outside.\n\n26:00.600 --> 26:03.080\n You're literally flying a little TV screen and radar.\n\n26:03.080 --> 26:04.320\n What are you looking at most of the time?\n\n26:04.320 --> 26:05.640\n So you're just at a screen.\n\n26:05.640 --> 26:08.160\n It's this really primitive.\n\n26:08.160 --> 26:11.360\n If you look at it now, what we did, you'd think, wow, that was crazy, but it was really\n\n26:11.360 --> 26:12.360\n fun.\n\n26:12.360 --> 26:14.120\n So is it similar to like the FLIR stuff?\n\n26:14.120 --> 26:17.760\n Is that, is, no, this thing is totally radar based.\n\n26:17.760 --> 26:22.360\n Now the airplane had a FLIR ball as a target recognition and multi sensor was called a\n\n26:22.360 --> 26:23.360\n tram.\n\n26:23.360 --> 26:27.320\n You're looking at like basically like dots of hard objects.\n\n26:27.320 --> 26:31.440\n No, actually what it is is the, the bomb of your navigator had a radar and he was getting\n\n26:31.440 --> 26:33.680\n raw feed off of a pulse radar in front.\n\n26:33.680 --> 26:34.680\n Okay.\n\n26:34.680 --> 26:35.920\n So it's just basically mapping the mountain.\n\n26:35.920 --> 26:39.840\n So if you look at a mountain on a radar and you're coming up on it, the front side is\n\n26:39.840 --> 26:41.900\n going to be, it's going to give you a really bright return.\n\n26:41.900 --> 26:45.680\n And then the backside, it's just going to be a giant shadow because you can't see on\n\n26:45.680 --> 26:47.740\n the other side.\n\n26:47.740 --> 26:50.800\n So the Bombardier navigators would do that and we, they would have charts and they could\n\n26:50.800 --> 26:53.880\n shade their charts knowing that, Hey, if we turn a little bit left here, we can get in\n\n26:53.880 --> 26:54.880\n this valley.\n\n26:54.880 --> 26:57.880\n We can sneak up this valley and then go around the backside of the mountain, which is what\n\n26:57.880 --> 26:59.200\n the airplane would do.\n\n26:59.200 --> 27:03.600\n And so, and sorry to interrupt, I'm going to just keep asking dumb questions, I apologize.\n\n27:03.600 --> 27:09.160\n But the pilot, can you, can you at a high level say what the pilot does versus the Bombardier?\n\n27:09.160 --> 27:10.780\n Yes.\n\n27:10.780 --> 27:13.240\n So you're, you're actually just control.\n\n27:13.240 --> 27:14.240\n I'm flying the jet.\n\n27:14.240 --> 27:20.480\n The throttle's the stick and I have a, it's about a, probably a four inch or six inch\n\n27:20.480 --> 27:24.560\n wide by maybe four inches, five inches high.\n\n27:24.560 --> 27:26.880\n It looks like it's literally a CRT.\n\n27:26.880 --> 27:27.880\n That's how old it is.\n\n27:27.880 --> 27:28.880\n A CRT screen.\n\n27:28.880 --> 27:33.160\n And what it would do, what the radar would do is the, the, the Bombardier navigator is\n\n27:33.160 --> 27:36.520\n looking at his radar and he's looking out about 12 and a half miles in front of the\n\n27:36.520 --> 27:37.520\n airplane.\n\n27:37.520 --> 27:40.440\n So he has the range really scoped down cause the radar can see a lot further.\n\n27:40.440 --> 27:43.360\n He's looking at about 12 and a half miles when we're in the terrain mode where we're\n\n27:43.360 --> 27:45.280\n dodging mountains and stuff.\n\n27:45.280 --> 27:49.360\n And what the pilot has is there's, they're called range bins and there's eight of them.\n\n27:49.360 --> 27:55.320\n So the very far range bin is the 12 and a half mile, you know, and the closest range\n\n27:55.320 --> 28:00.600\n bin, it's a thing and it'll be like between like a half a mile and or a quarter mile to\n\n28:00.600 --> 28:01.600\n three quarters of a mile.\n\n28:01.600 --> 28:04.680\n And the next one might be three quarters of a mile to two miles.\n\n28:04.680 --> 28:06.300\n And then it just keeps going out like that.\n\n28:06.300 --> 28:10.900\n So if there's a mountain in front, let's say we're on a flat plane and there's a mountain\n\n28:10.900 --> 28:12.720\n out in the distance at 15 miles.\n\n28:12.720 --> 28:14.940\n And we were just driving right at it.\n\n28:14.940 --> 28:18.360\n So when we get to the point where it hits 12 and a half miles where the radar is going\n\n28:18.360 --> 28:23.400\n to see it on his scope, my 12th, my range bin for that would pop up and it would show\n\n28:23.400 --> 28:25.640\n like a big bump, like a mountain.\n\n28:25.640 --> 28:29.440\n And then as I got closer to it, the next range bin would pop up and show it.\n\n28:29.440 --> 28:32.320\n And I could see that that bump was moving towards me.\n\n28:32.320 --> 28:36.240\n And then if I turned a little bit, you know, to go over here, I'd see the mountain go over\n\n28:36.240 --> 28:41.460\n to the right hand side and I could do that, but it wasn't like a video game.\n\n28:41.460 --> 28:44.440\n It's literally like, if you think of the original Atari's.\n\n28:44.440 --> 28:45.440\n Yeah.\n\n28:45.440 --> 28:51.960\n But you build up, I imagine that you start to get a really deep sense of like the actual\n\n28:51.960 --> 28:56.600\n 3D environment based on that little Atari's solid display.\n\n28:56.600 --> 28:57.600\n You're exactly right.\n\n28:57.600 --> 28:59.100\n And you have to, you have to train.\n\n28:59.100 --> 29:03.160\n So there's been studies, as a matter of fact, a lot of the basis and people probably argue\n\n29:03.160 --> 29:04.280\n with me, but it's true.\n\n29:04.280 --> 29:09.160\n There were studies done watching A6 crews in our simulators, we call it the WIST, the\n\n29:09.160 --> 29:13.680\n systems trainer, and it was not even a motion, it just kind of sat there and you just, you\n\n29:13.680 --> 29:17.680\n could fly these things and they had terrain that they would inject into the system.\n\n29:17.680 --> 29:24.720\n But the crew coordination, so you get, so my first fleet bombardier navigator, who I'll\n\n29:24.720 --> 29:32.760\n name him, his name's Chris Sato, he works at Apple, pretty high up, MIT grad, I think\n\n29:32.760 --> 29:36.720\n computer engineering, he's scary smart.\n\n29:36.720 --> 29:40.760\n So Chris could really work, as a matter of fact, all the guys I flew with, so there's\n\n29:40.760 --> 29:44.320\n another guy, Matt, who also worked at Apple, who's now at SAP, we did our first night traps\n\n29:44.320 --> 29:45.320\n together.\n\n29:45.320 --> 29:48.440\n The bond between us, I mean, it's one of those things that you just, you're never going to\n\n29:48.440 --> 29:51.680\n forget, but Chris and I, when we started flying together, we were actually the most junior\n\n29:51.680 --> 29:55.480\n crew in the squadron.\n\n29:55.480 --> 30:01.560\n We'd spent a lot of time training and Chris was amazing at how he could work the system,\n\n30:01.560 --> 30:05.720\n one because he was extremely brilliant and he had that inquisitive mind of, oh, we can\n\n30:05.720 --> 30:10.080\n do all these different things and there's all these degradation modes.\n\n30:10.080 --> 30:15.280\n But we spent a lot of time to see how good we could actually get, because, and it's,\n\n30:15.280 --> 30:16.800\n you almost talk in partials.\n\n30:16.800 --> 30:22.800\n So as the BN is looking at his radar scope, Chris would say, I've got rising terrain,\n\n30:22.800 --> 30:25.640\n that's just what they say, showing rising terrain at 12 miles.\n\n30:25.640 --> 30:28.680\n And I'd see the little bump and I'd say, got it.\n\n30:28.680 --> 30:32.280\n This is going to go to your question on the autonomy and how you work with two heads.\n\n30:32.280 --> 30:38.400\n So when you first get together, the interaction, it's almost like you have to rehearse it,\n\n30:38.400 --> 30:42.240\n you have to know, and you talk in full sentences.\n\n30:42.240 --> 30:50.880\n The more and more we fly together, Chris could go, I'm showing and he'd get like rising out\n\n30:50.880 --> 30:53.320\n and before he finished, I'd say, I've got it.\n\n30:53.320 --> 31:00.800\n So you end up starting to talk in partials because I have to trust him like, I mean,\n\n31:00.800 --> 31:05.200\n there can be no, I can have no doubt that he knows how to do his job because I'm literally\n\n31:05.200 --> 31:09.240\n looking at this little scope that's not giving me this continuous picture of that mountain\n\n31:09.240 --> 31:10.240\n moving.\n\n31:10.240 --> 31:12.560\n Remember the mountain's here and then it's going to pop up here and then it's going to\n\n31:12.560 --> 31:16.400\n pop up here because there's gaps in the coverage on how the system was set up.\n\n31:16.400 --> 31:20.680\n Remember it's an analog system to where he is telling me, like, I can't see all the way\n\n31:20.680 --> 31:25.640\n to the left and he's got a wider scope on the radar, but my screen doesn't show that.\n\n31:25.640 --> 31:30.740\n So he's telling me, start a left turn, start a hard turn, you know, and we would do that.\n\n31:30.740 --> 31:31.740\n So my truck.\n\n31:31.740 --> 31:32.960\n And this is all happening quick?\n\n31:32.960 --> 31:33.960\n Very quick.\n\n31:33.960 --> 31:38.960\n Well, you're doing, we would typically fly between 420 and 480 knots of ground speed.\n\n31:38.960 --> 31:39.960\n How many miles an hour?\n\n31:39.960 --> 31:43.040\n Well, 420 is seven miles a minute.\n\n31:43.040 --> 31:44.040\n Okay.\n\n31:44.040 --> 31:46.560\n Or eight, between seven and eight miles a minute is what you're flying.\n\n31:46.560 --> 31:47.560\n That's fast.\n\n31:47.560 --> 31:48.560\n At night.\n\n31:48.560 --> 31:49.560\n I mean, I broke out of clouds.\n\n31:49.560 --> 31:54.400\n I mean, I remember him and I flying, we were on, it's the IR, it's called an IR route, an\n\n31:54.400 --> 31:57.320\n instrument route that's low, they're all around the country.\n\n31:57.320 --> 32:01.160\n There's the IR 344 that we used to fly, which would coast in off of Oregon, you'd fly from\n\n32:01.160 --> 32:03.820\n the land, you go out over the ocean, turn around and then you could practice actually\n\n32:03.820 --> 32:10.320\n coming in on a coastline and we were flying and we ended up in the clouds.\n\n32:10.320 --> 32:13.760\n Keep in mind, we're between 500 and a thousand feet in the mountains and we're in the clouds.\n\n32:13.760 --> 32:14.760\n You can't see anything.\n\n32:14.760 --> 32:17.960\n And I had to turn off our red lights that flash, you know, they're called the anti collision\n\n32:17.960 --> 32:23.880\n lights because it was reflecting off the clouds and it starts to bother you, just gets annoying.\n\n32:23.880 --> 32:26.680\n So I turned it off and we were flying, we're flying, we're flying.\n\n32:26.680 --> 32:32.200\n We break out of that coastal marine layer and poof, we break out and it's a decent night.\n\n32:32.200 --> 32:33.640\n And this is right by Mount St. Helens.\n\n32:33.640 --> 32:34.640\n This is kind of where we're coming in.\n\n32:34.640 --> 32:37.240\n So we're coming in from the east and we're just north of Mount St. Helens is where the\n\n32:37.240 --> 32:38.440\n route goes.\n\n32:38.440 --> 32:41.180\n And you look up, you know, cause you can kind of see the silhouette of this mountain that's\n\n32:41.180 --> 32:42.920\n right next to you, but you're flying along.\n\n32:42.920 --> 32:46.680\n You're just like, you know, you got to trust and you can see houses, you can see the lights,\n\n32:46.680 --> 32:47.680\n they're above you.\n\n32:47.680 --> 32:50.080\n We're literally below people's houses flying down these valleys and stuff.\n\n32:50.080 --> 32:51.780\n So just incredible experience.\n\n32:51.780 --> 32:55.500\n So when you take that and then you move into an F18F.\n\n32:55.500 --> 33:01.680\n So now we're into modern technology that was actually built in this century and you're\n\n33:01.680 --> 33:02.680\n flying.\n\n33:02.680 --> 33:05.520\n So now, you know, the WIZO is behind us and we're not doing those night low levels, but\n\n33:05.520 --> 33:11.720\n that same type of crew coordination that has to happen because what you're doing is you're\n\n33:11.720 --> 33:13.080\n sharing the load.\n\n33:13.080 --> 33:16.420\n So most of the communications that go out of the airplane, the WIZO does all the talk\n\n33:16.420 --> 33:18.600\n and he's got actually, he uses his feet.\n\n33:18.600 --> 33:21.920\n That's the weapon systems operator in the back of an F18F.\n\n33:21.920 --> 33:26.840\n So he's going to run, well, the radar kind of runs itself now, but we have a situational\n\n33:26.840 --> 33:29.640\n awareness display and it's linked to all the other airplanes.\n\n33:29.640 --> 33:31.880\n Just out of curiosity, what's the situational awareness display?\n\n33:31.880 --> 33:34.400\n Because that term comes up a lot.\n\n33:34.400 --> 33:35.920\n Think of it as a God's eye view.\n\n33:35.920 --> 33:39.800\n So if you have the back of the Super Hornet has, well, the Block IIs has about an eight\n\n33:39.800 --> 33:43.320\n by 10 display for the WIZOs that they can look at.\n\n33:43.320 --> 33:44.320\n The pilot's is smaller.\n\n33:44.320 --> 33:48.520\n It's down between his, it's a six by six between his legs and they're getting ready to redesign\n\n33:48.520 --> 33:49.560\n that Boeing is.\n\n33:49.560 --> 33:53.640\n But when you looked, it'd be like if you put your airplane and you're looking down.\n\n33:53.640 --> 33:57.000\n So all the stuff, like if your radar seeing bad guys out in front of you, it'd be like\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:58.640\n looking down and going, oh, I'm right here.\n\n33:58.640 --> 34:01.600\n And now there's bad guys out here and my wingman is over here.\n\n34:01.600 --> 34:02.600\n And it shows everything.\n\n34:02.600 --> 34:06.760\n It's just like, it gives you, you can look at that display and go, oh, I can see where\n\n34:06.760 --> 34:07.760\n everything's at.\n\n34:07.760 --> 34:10.760\n I can see if one guy's trying to target another guy, it shows you all this.\n\n34:10.760 --> 34:18.660\n It's an incredible amount of knowledge that comes up for the crews to maintain the overall\n\n34:18.660 --> 34:24.880\n picture of what's going on because it's happening so fast and this is where that autonomy piece,\n\n34:24.880 --> 34:26.460\n this is the third brain.\n\n34:26.460 --> 34:29.500\n So we're all looking at it and the third brain is doing fusion.\n\n34:29.500 --> 34:31.600\n It's pulling stuff together going, oh, this is all this guy.\n\n34:31.600 --> 34:32.600\n This is this guy.\n\n34:32.600 --> 34:33.600\n This is this guy.\n\n34:33.600 --> 34:34.600\n It's sending it out through the link.\n\n34:34.600 --> 34:37.920\n So all the airplanes are talking to each other through this digital network that we don't\n\n34:37.920 --> 34:38.920\n even see.\n\n34:38.920 --> 34:41.080\n It just says, that airplane says, hey, I'm over here.\n\n34:41.080 --> 34:43.500\n And it tells us and we go, oh, he's right there.\n\n34:43.500 --> 34:47.960\n And then we can go, his airplane says, oh, I'm looking at this airplane, this bad guy.\n\n34:47.960 --> 34:50.440\n And it shows us, oh, he's over there and he's looking at this guy.\n\n34:50.440 --> 34:57.160\n I mean, it's an incredible amount of visual intake because your eye, you can hear a lot,\n\n34:57.160 --> 35:00.440\n but when you look down at stuff, it's, you know, you can sell the picture really quick.\n\n35:00.440 --> 35:07.160\n The third brain is doing the sensor fusion, the integration of the different sensors and\n\n35:07.160 --> 35:08.680\n gives you a big picture view.\n\n35:08.680 --> 35:09.680\n What about the control?\n\n35:09.680 --> 35:15.240\n Like, is there, and I apologize as if this is a dumb question, but you know, people use\n\n35:15.240 --> 35:17.560\n the high level term of autopilot.\n\n35:17.560 --> 35:22.720\n How much is there, let's use a loose term of AI.\n\n35:22.720 --> 35:24.160\n How much automation is there?\n\n35:24.160 --> 35:27.560\n How much AI is there in helping you control there?\n\n35:27.560 --> 35:31.600\n The AI piece would be more of a control loop because of the digital flight controls.\n\n35:31.600 --> 35:36.120\n So the airplane actually, they had to make the airplane easier to fly.\n\n35:36.120 --> 35:38.800\n And when I say easy, it's relative because people go, I could do it because I did it\n\n35:38.800 --> 35:40.600\n on flight sim.\n\n35:40.600 --> 35:42.400\n Real life is a lot different.\n\n35:42.400 --> 35:44.240\n In flight sim, you have no apparent fear of death.\n\n35:44.240 --> 35:46.840\n You'll do things on a simulator that you would never do in real life.\n\n35:46.840 --> 35:52.680\n But the autonomy in the airplane to allow you to manage, I mean, because you think about\n\n35:52.680 --> 35:55.760\n it, you've got a radar that's feeding you data.\n\n35:55.760 --> 35:58.120\n You've got a targeting pod that's feeding you data.\n\n35:58.120 --> 36:01.640\n All that stuff is hooked to your head because you've got a joint helmet mounted cueing system\n\n36:01.640 --> 36:05.640\n on that basically maps the magnetic field in the cockpit so it can tell where your head's\n\n36:05.640 --> 36:07.000\n at looking.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.800\n So if I turn my head to the right, the radar will actually look to the right.\n\n36:09.800 --> 36:11.320\n The targeting flare will look to the right.\n\n36:11.320 --> 36:15.960\n And oh, by the way, the backseater has a helmet on too, so he can look to the left and he\n\n36:15.960 --> 36:16.960\n can do things.\n\n36:16.960 --> 36:21.600\n So depending on what sensor he's controlling, so if he's got control of the targeting pod\n\n36:21.600 --> 36:25.000\n and he looks left, the targeting pod looks left.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:28.160\n But if I have something where I want to lock a guy up that I don't see, that maybe the\n\n36:28.160 --> 36:31.600\n radar didn't see, but I can get over and now point the radar, you know, get the, because\n\n36:31.600 --> 36:35.160\n it's a phased array radar now, it doesn't really scan.\n\n36:35.160 --> 36:40.520\n There's all kinds of cool stuff that that technology brings.\n\n36:40.520 --> 36:44.400\n Because if you just, if you went back 30 years and said, hey, or 40 years ago and said, hey,\n\n36:44.400 --> 36:47.560\n we're gonna have this helmet and you're gonna be able to slew everything to your head.\n\n36:47.560 --> 36:51.200\n And I don't mean a mechanical setup, but I mean literally you're just gonna map magnetic\n\n36:51.200 --> 36:57.520\n resonance and go, oh, look, and I can literally slew my sensors this fast and then mash a\n\n36:57.520 --> 37:03.240\n button and transfer, you know, high quality coordinates from a system into a joint, you\n\n37:03.240 --> 37:07.520\n know, a JDAM, which is a joint direct attack munition that is the GPS bombs that you see\n\n37:07.520 --> 37:10.040\n all the time, and then let that thing fly.\n\n37:10.040 --> 37:15.480\n And I'm solving this problem in seconds, vice minutes, or, hey, I got it, we're gonna have\n\n37:15.480 --> 37:18.940\n to menstruate coordinates and, you know, you bring back the data and then they do all the\n\n37:18.940 --> 37:22.720\n targeting for it and then they send another group out to get it instead of all that.\n\n37:22.720 --> 37:24.320\n Now it's that fast.\n\n37:24.320 --> 37:28.580\n So there's a, okay, I mean, we probably don't have enough time to talk about the beautiful\n\n37:28.580 --> 37:33.400\n fusion of minds that happens when two people are flying, controlling the plane.\n\n37:33.400 --> 37:38.960\n But at a high level, this is a really interesting question for people who don't know what they're\n\n37:38.960 --> 37:46.000\n talking about, like me, which is, what is the difference between a human being and an\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:47.320\n AI system?\n\n37:47.320 --> 37:54.000\n Like what can, what is the ceiling of a current AI technology for controlling the plane?\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:57.360\n Like how much does the human contribute?\n\n37:57.360 --> 38:04.240\n Is it possible to have automated flight, for example, like what is the hardest part about\n\n38:04.240 --> 38:12.280\n flying that a human does expertly that an AI system cannot in warfare situations in\n\n38:12.280 --> 38:15.360\n flying a fighter jet plane?\n\n38:15.360 --> 38:20.640\n So I would say AI systems are usually black and white.\n\n38:20.640 --> 38:26.680\n When you write the algorithm for an AI system, it's really, it's basically you're taking\n\n38:26.680 --> 38:30.400\n thought and turning it into a giant math problem is really what you're doing, right?\n\n38:30.400 --> 38:32.840\n So you've got this logical math problem.\n\n38:32.840 --> 38:36.760\n Math problems are, there's a line that says I can or I can't.\n\n38:36.760 --> 38:42.860\n And it's a very finite line, but you can go up to the line where a human, we all have\n\n38:42.860 --> 38:48.360\n gray areas where we go, eh, maybe, eh, I'll try it.\n\n38:48.360 --> 38:50.120\n So humans can operate within that gray.\n\n38:50.120 --> 38:53.680\n So if you took, if you take an airplane and say, and I'll just take a Hornet for a while,\n\n38:53.680 --> 38:57.840\n a Super Hornet, it doesn't matter, any airplane, and you go, here is the flight performance\n\n38:57.840 --> 38:58.920\n model of the airplane.\n\n38:58.920 --> 39:04.360\n So if you know what an EM diagram is, the energy, so it basically says the airplane\n\n39:04.360 --> 39:08.680\n can fly as slow as this, it can go as fast as this, it can pull this many Gs, force of\n\n39:08.680 --> 39:13.400\n gravity, so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and then based on the airfoil design\n\n39:13.400 --> 39:18.040\n and everything else and how it can pull, here's how it's going to fly, because it's really\n\n39:18.040 --> 39:19.160\n physics based.\n\n39:19.160 --> 39:23.960\n Well, if you, depending on how you write the AI, but typically AI, you don't want the airplane\n\n39:23.960 --> 39:25.920\n to leave controlled flight, right?\n\n39:25.920 --> 39:29.720\n You want to maintain it so that it is flying in a controlled envelope.\n\n39:29.720 --> 39:34.840\n Where there are times, and you can go back to World War I, where people intentionally\n\n39:34.840 --> 39:39.880\n departed the airplane from controlled flight in order to obtain an advantage, which is,\n\n39:39.880 --> 39:42.600\n that's where the human goes, can I do this?\n\n39:42.600 --> 39:46.400\n I know it's outside of where I would normally go, but I can do that.\n\n39:46.400 --> 39:51.800\n So you can do some crazy things now, especially since the flight control logic in modern airplanes\n\n39:51.800 --> 39:56.320\n with digital flight controls, they're extremely forgiving.\n\n39:56.320 --> 40:02.320\n So you can literally, I've done things in Super Hornets that literally, even as a pilot\n\n40:02.320 --> 40:05.760\n inside the airplane, you're just like, wow, I cannot believe it just did that.\n\n40:05.760 --> 40:11.880\n Like it'll flop ends, which defies most logic, and I guess in a way you could probably program\n\n40:11.880 --> 40:18.320\n it, but I still think when you get to the edges that may or may not give you an advantage,\n\n40:18.320 --> 40:23.200\n there are things that a human will do that AI won't.\n\n40:23.200 --> 40:29.400\n And I don't think we've got to the point, because how do you map illogical solutions?\n\n40:29.400 --> 40:30.600\n Most AI is logical.\n\n40:30.600 --> 40:36.120\n It's based on some type of premise when you write the algorithm to control it.\n\n40:36.120 --> 40:37.120\n There's bounds.\n\n40:37.120 --> 40:41.960\n Yeah, there's this giant mess, like you said, the difference between the simulator and real\n\n40:41.960 --> 40:44.080\n life also gets at that somehow.\n\n40:44.080 --> 40:51.720\n That there is somehow the fear of death, all of that beautiful mess comes into play.\n\n40:51.720 --> 40:59.120\n Is there a comment you can make on commercial flight, like with Sully landing that plane\n\n40:59.120 --> 41:04.800\n famously versus the simulator, all of those discussions, is there some?\n\n41:04.800 --> 41:08.040\n Well, it's very similar to what I was talking about earlier with the A6.\n\n41:08.040 --> 41:13.240\n So one is when you're flying with a crew, there's standardization.\n\n41:13.240 --> 41:17.120\n So you got to remember when Sully flew, when his first officer, that's the co pilot, showed\n\n41:17.120 --> 41:21.560\n up the first time they'd met, and this happens all the time in the commercial world.\n\n41:21.560 --> 41:25.960\n There's six, 7,000 pilots at United Airlines, your chance of flying with the same guy all\n\n41:25.960 --> 41:26.960\n the time is slim and none.\n\n41:26.960 --> 41:29.280\n Where in the Navy, we were crewed.\n\n41:29.280 --> 41:33.960\n So I had a primary and a secondary whizzo that flew with me.\n\n41:33.960 --> 41:34.960\n For months?\n\n41:34.960 --> 41:37.880\n Oh yeah, for like all of the deployment.\n\n41:37.880 --> 41:42.000\n Because you want to get to know, trust and all of those things.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:43.880\n It increases the capability of the airplane.\n\n41:43.880 --> 41:48.360\n It's not to say we can't swap out, but for true effectiveness, especially in very complex\n\n41:48.360 --> 41:53.480\n missions like a forward air controller, we're in the air actually controlling ground assets\n\n41:53.480 --> 41:57.040\n and supporting ground troops.\n\n41:57.040 --> 42:02.480\n If you're in a high threat area, which is crazy busy, you have to be melded when you\n\n42:02.480 --> 42:03.480\n do that.\n\n42:03.480 --> 42:07.000\n You have to have trained to do that job, otherwise you're going to be ineffective.\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:13.360\n So when you get to the commercial world, and I've got tons of friends that fly commercial,\n\n42:13.360 --> 42:15.120\n there is a standardization.\n\n42:15.120 --> 42:18.440\n Like we know that at this point, I'm going to put this switch, you're going to do that.\n\n42:18.440 --> 42:20.520\n And everyone, they know their roles.\n\n42:20.520 --> 42:23.060\n Captain's going to do this, first officer's going to do this.\n\n42:23.060 --> 42:26.720\n And they know that when the emergency breaks out, so in Sully's case, when they take the\n\n42:26.720 --> 42:30.600\n birds and they know they've got a problem, and if you've listened to the cockpit recordings\n\n42:30.600 --> 42:35.640\n of the two of them talking, you got to remember, they're talking to each other when you hear\n\n42:35.640 --> 42:39.120\n the full tapes, but they're also talking to the air traffic controllers in the New York\n\n42:39.120 --> 42:40.560\n area.\n\n42:40.560 --> 42:44.280\n And it's like, we got a bird strike and the first officer already knows, hey, silence\n\n42:44.280 --> 42:45.280\n the alarm.\n\n42:45.280 --> 42:46.280\n They silence the alarm.\n\n42:46.280 --> 42:49.240\n The first officer is pulling out the book, he's going through the procedures while Sully's\n\n42:49.240 --> 42:52.000\n actually flying the airplane, knowing that they've lost their motors.\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:54.920\n And you got to think his decision process, like they're trying to get him to go into\n\n42:54.920 --> 42:59.120\n an airport in New Jersey, and he realizes, not happening, we're going to put this thing.\n\n42:59.120 --> 43:03.120\n And he made a decision soon enough so that he could prepare everyone on the airplane\n\n43:03.120 --> 43:05.560\n that he was going to put this thing in the Hudson River.\n\n43:05.560 --> 43:06.560\n And he did it flawlessly.\n\n43:06.560 --> 43:10.280\n I mean, every single person walked away from that wreck.\n\n43:10.280 --> 43:14.960\n The only thing that didn't survive was the airplane, and it got fished out of the Hudson.\n\n43:14.960 --> 43:17.400\n What is it about those human decisions you had to make?\n\n43:17.400 --> 43:22.560\n Is that something you put into words or is that just deep down some instinct that you\n\n43:22.560 --> 43:25.000\n develop as a pilot over time?\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:28.660\n When you train, and aviation is a self cleaning oven.\n\n43:28.660 --> 43:33.720\n So if you make bad decisions, and the list is long and distinguished of those who have\n\n43:33.720 --> 43:36.720\n died by making bad decisions.\n\n43:36.720 --> 43:41.480\n So when you look at what he did or the way we train, because the commercial industry\n\n43:41.480 --> 43:47.740\n and the Navy and the Air Force, for all that, we have what's called, we have emergency procedures\n\n43:47.740 --> 43:48.740\n that we have to know.\n\n43:48.740 --> 43:52.660\n Like engines on fire, the first three steps, you just have to know what they are, right?\n\n43:52.660 --> 43:53.660\n So they know.\n\n43:53.660 --> 43:57.840\n The airline, same type, they go, hey, I know this is, they pull the book out because the\n\n43:57.840 --> 44:00.880\n airplanes are designed, they're built to have some time.\n\n44:00.880 --> 44:03.760\n But there's a point where you have to make a decision and you can't second guess it.\n\n44:03.760 --> 44:07.440\n So when he decided I'm putting this in the Hudson River, he couldn't all of a sudden\n\n44:07.440 --> 44:10.920\n halfway through it go, well, maybe I can get over to that airport.\n\n44:10.920 --> 44:12.840\n He looked, he made a quick assessment.\n\n44:12.840 --> 44:18.280\n This is that 80% solution where you go, these are not, it's like a multiple choice test\n\n44:18.280 --> 44:22.320\n when you go, oh my God, I don't really know the answer, but I know A and D are wrong,\n\n44:22.320 --> 44:23.320\n gone.\n\n44:23.320 --> 44:26.720\n So the Jersey airport and going back to LaGuardia, gone.\n\n44:26.720 --> 44:28.160\n So what's my next option?\n\n44:28.160 --> 44:31.520\n Well, the Hudson River's there and that's probably looking pretty good.\n\n44:31.520 --> 44:33.060\n Or what is my other one?\n\n44:33.060 --> 44:34.800\n Can I get a restart on the motors?\n\n44:34.800 --> 44:38.300\n And then if I can get a restart, now can I take it someplace else?\n\n44:38.300 --> 44:40.960\n He had to make really, really fast decisions.\n\n44:40.960 --> 44:44.880\n And then once they, as they go, that 80% solution, you realize, all right, I'm going into the\n\n44:44.880 --> 44:47.080\n Hudson, there's the 80%, get the book out.\n\n44:47.080 --> 44:48.080\n Let's see if we can get an air start.\n\n44:48.080 --> 44:50.340\n Because if you listen to the tapes, they're trying to get it air started.\n\n44:50.340 --> 44:55.180\n The closer he gets to the water, the more he's going, I'm ditching the airplane.\n\n44:55.180 --> 44:59.600\n So the original decision to, this is my best option right now.\n\n44:59.600 --> 45:01.240\n This is where I'm going.\n\n45:01.240 --> 45:05.700\n And you start eliminating anything that could possibly change the events, which they tried\n\n45:05.700 --> 45:06.920\n to do.\n\n45:06.920 --> 45:09.560\n And then he gets to that last minute, he says, we're going in the water.\n\n45:09.560 --> 45:10.600\n They changed the plan.\n\n45:10.600 --> 45:11.600\n They secure the airplane.\n\n45:11.600 --> 45:12.600\n They do exactly what they're doing.\n\n45:12.600 --> 45:15.280\n And he does that basically flawless landing on the Hudson.\n\n45:15.280 --> 45:22.160\n But you got to remember, it's every six months for commercial, they go back and they do research\n\n45:22.160 --> 45:23.960\n in the airplane in the simulator.\n\n45:23.960 --> 45:27.180\n Where they train to the airplane being broken.\n\n45:27.180 --> 45:28.440\n You just lost a motor.\n\n45:28.440 --> 45:30.120\n You just lost another motor.\n\n45:30.120 --> 45:36.000\n So they go through this extensive training and all these, we used to refer to it in the\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:37.640\n Navy as the pain cave where you're going to get in.\n\n45:37.640 --> 45:41.680\n Because you know that when you get in for your check ride in a simulator, that the airplane\n\n45:41.680 --> 45:42.680\n is going to break.\n\n45:42.680 --> 45:46.300\n You're going to lose hydro, and it's sometimes they're a problem like, oh, I just lost this\n\n45:46.300 --> 45:48.840\n hydraulic system, but I'm having an issue on the other motor.\n\n45:48.840 --> 45:52.640\n Well, if I shut down this motor and I've got a hydraulics, because there's two hydraulic\n\n45:52.640 --> 45:54.040\n systems, one on each motor.\n\n45:54.040 --> 45:58.160\n Well, if I've got an issue with the left motor hydraulic system and my right motor is starting\n\n45:58.160 --> 46:01.920\n to give me indications, do I want to shut the right motor down because that's going\n\n46:01.920 --> 46:04.300\n to kill my hydraulic system that's good.\n\n46:04.300 --> 46:07.560\n And now I'm flying on a good motor with a bad hydraulic system and without hydraulics,\n\n46:07.560 --> 46:08.560\n the airplane won't fly.\n\n46:08.560 --> 46:12.640\n So it's a really, they're challenging problems that you have to think through in real time.\n\n46:12.640 --> 46:14.560\n And of course, the weather's never good.\n\n46:14.560 --> 46:15.840\n It's always dark.\n\n46:15.840 --> 46:16.840\n It's always crappy.\n\n46:16.840 --> 46:17.840\n You're going to break out.\n\n46:17.840 --> 46:23.120\n It's just all this stuff gets compiled on top of you and it's intended to increase the\n\n46:23.120 --> 46:28.800\n level of stress because when things happen, like in Sully's case, we like to joke it's\n\n46:28.800 --> 46:33.000\n going to STEM power, you know, where the functional part of your brain shuts down and you are\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.320\n literally on instinct like an animal.\n\n46:35.320 --> 46:39.120\n Well, if you've trained so much that that is the instinctive reaction that you're going\n\n46:39.120 --> 46:45.480\n to have when the main part of your cognitive abilities start to shut down, you're running\n\n46:45.480 --> 46:50.560\n that instinct is ingrained so much into you that you know exactly what to do.\n\n46:50.560 --> 46:52.120\n And that's literally how it happens.\n\n46:52.120 --> 46:54.920\n So there's no, how do I put it?\n\n46:54.920 --> 46:56.160\n Fear of death.\n\n46:56.160 --> 47:02.000\n Like in Sully's case, do you think he was at all ever thinking about the fact if his\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:05.520\n decision is wrong, a lot of people are going to die?\n\n47:05.520 --> 47:09.340\n You know, I can't speak for him, but I would say there was so much going on at the cockpit\n\n47:09.340 --> 47:11.000\n in that time.\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:17.440\n His, his mindset was probably, I can do this, I'm trained, I'm going to do the procedures,\n\n47:17.440 --> 47:19.880\n I've practiced this before, I've done these things.\n\n47:19.880 --> 47:23.400\n And I, you know, I'm assuming that in his mindset, cause I never thought about when\n\n47:23.400 --> 47:24.680\n things were really bad.\n\n47:24.680 --> 47:27.160\n You know, if you're having problems with the airplane that, you know, that I was going\n\n47:27.160 --> 47:31.000\n to mort, you know, and, and plant it into the ground, it was always, you know, maybe\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:32.920\n it's an ego thing where you think I can do this.\n\n47:32.920 --> 47:33.920\n I mean,\n\n47:33.920 --> 47:43.960\n So you never, have you experienced fear during flight, like, I mean, one, one way we just\n\n47:43.960 --> 47:52.080\n offline mentioned Mike Tyson, I mean, he talked about like, as he's walking up to the ring,\n\n47:52.080 --> 47:59.800\n he's like, he starts out basically in fear and, yeah, worried about how things are going\n\n47:59.800 --> 48:00.800\n to go.\n\n48:00.800 --> 48:04.440\n And it's purely to put in towards his fear, but as he gets closer and closer to the ring\n\n48:04.440 --> 48:11.400\n is the confidence grows and grows until the ego basically takes over to where you think\n\n48:11.400 --> 48:15.800\n there's no way anybody could defeat me.\n\n48:15.800 --> 48:18.720\n So like, that's, that's his experience of overcoming fear.\n\n48:18.720 --> 48:23.000\n But do you, did you experience any kind of thing like that?\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:27.400\n Or is that, or do you just go to the part of the brain that goes to the training and\n\n48:27.400 --> 48:30.880\n then you just go to the instinctual 80% solution?\n\n48:30.880 --> 48:32.840\n I wouldn't say I was never afraid.\n\n48:32.840 --> 48:36.880\n I think that would be, I can't, I couldn't tell you that anyone I know that wasn't afraid\n\n48:36.880 --> 48:37.880\n at one time.\n\n48:37.880 --> 48:43.400\n And for most of us, especially Navy carrier pilots, it's just, it's, it's usually, especially\n\n48:43.400 --> 48:47.120\n when you're new and you got to go out and it's nighttime and there's no moon and the\n\n48:47.120 --> 48:51.560\n weather sucks and the deck's moving, you know, the, the ship's going up and down because\n\n48:51.560 --> 48:53.840\n it will scare the hell out of you.\n\n48:53.840 --> 48:54.840\n Can I say that?\n\n48:54.840 --> 48:58.480\n You can definitely say that, so it's about landing and take off that.\n\n48:58.480 --> 49:02.800\n That is, if you, even they used to wire people up, they did it during Vietnam, you know,\n\n49:02.800 --> 49:06.000\n guys would go fly missions, you know, when they were flying low and crazy stuff was going\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:09.440\n on and people were getting shot down a lot.\n\n49:09.440 --> 49:12.960\n The highest, the highest anxiety and heart rates were coming back to land on board an\n\n49:12.960 --> 49:13.960\n aircraft carrier.\n\n49:13.960 --> 49:15.360\n How hard is it to land on that?\n\n49:15.360 --> 49:16.360\n It seems impossible.\n\n49:16.360 --> 49:23.200\n Like for, for a civilian, I guess, like me, it just seems crazy that a human can do that.\n\n49:23.200 --> 49:28.520\n The problem with night is, and there's different degrees of night, just like day.\n\n49:28.520 --> 49:32.800\n I mean, there's the clear full moon night, you know, where it's like, woo, you know,\n\n49:32.800 --> 49:37.880\n this is not that bad, but you got to remember at night, I think everyone can associate with\n\n49:37.880 --> 49:43.000\n you're driving in your car and it's just a, it's, it's an overcast dark night and you're\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:46.040\n on a country road with no side lights.\n\n49:46.040 --> 49:50.200\n Most people have a tendency to slow down just by nature of, Oh my God.\n\n49:50.200 --> 49:53.820\n Because you, what you'll do is you'll out drive your headlights because it is so dark,\n\n49:53.820 --> 49:56.120\n you know, and you can get outside of, you get outside of the city and get up into New\n\n49:56.120 --> 50:01.080\n Hampshire, especially when the roads are curving, you know, and the lines probably aren't that\n\n50:01.080 --> 50:02.080\n good.\n\n50:02.080 --> 50:07.520\n It's, you know, now take that and multiply it by like a million because you have no depth\n\n50:07.520 --> 50:09.960\n perception.\n\n50:09.960 --> 50:16.080\n What you think is fixed, the runway is actually moving up and down and left to right.\n\n50:16.080 --> 50:22.040\n Yeah, oh, and when it's really bad, you can actually see it move and we have two systems,\n\n50:22.040 --> 50:27.560\n you know, there was a, there's an automatic system that's actually, it stabilizes with\n\n50:27.560 --> 50:30.880\n the inertials on the ship and then there's the ILS.\n\n50:30.880 --> 50:35.340\n Now civilian pilots will tell you that ILS is a precision approach, which gives you azimuth\n\n50:35.340 --> 50:36.340\n and glide slope.\n\n50:36.340 --> 50:39.080\n You know, you come down, it's like a plus.\n\n50:39.080 --> 50:42.000\n On the carrier, it's not, it's really just a beam that goes out and it's considered a\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:43.640\n non precision approach.\n\n50:43.640 --> 50:47.800\n It's not stabilized at all that, and I've been where you can actually watch the needle\n\n50:47.800 --> 50:49.720\n and the, and the tack and needle will move.\n\n50:49.720 --> 50:53.920\n There's all kinds of stuff moving cause the base that it's all sitting on is doing this\n\n50:53.920 --> 50:55.680\n and ships don't just go up and down.\n\n50:55.680 --> 50:56.760\n They, they, they do this.\n\n50:56.760 --> 51:00.480\n So the bow goes up and down in the tail, like you normally see a ship and then there's,\n\n51:00.480 --> 51:03.120\n so that's pitch and then it has roll.\n\n51:03.120 --> 51:04.680\n So it's doing this and then it has heave.\n\n51:04.680 --> 51:08.640\n So the whole boat is going up and down while it's pitching and rolling and you're gonna\n\n51:08.640 --> 51:09.640\n land on that.\n\n51:09.640 --> 51:17.000\n Um, so, and it's, I mean, I remember landing as I was with Chris, uh, Sato and, uh, Chris\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:19.680\n and I, we were off the USS ranger, which is now decommissioned.\n\n51:19.680 --> 51:24.400\n It's sitting, getting turned into razorblades, um, we're flying the old a six and we come\n\n51:24.400 --> 51:27.920\n in and it was off of San Diego and it was just ugly night cause San Diego always has\n\n51:27.920 --> 51:31.980\n a Marine layer that is about 1200 feet was lower than that, that night and it was pouring\n\n51:31.980 --> 51:32.980\n down rain.\n\n51:32.980 --> 51:34.720\n It was an El Nino year and there's thunderstorms all around.\n\n51:34.720 --> 51:37.840\n It was just craziest night I've ever seen out of San Diego.\n\n51:37.840 --> 51:42.120\n And I remember landing and your adrenaline is so high that you're shaking.\n\n51:42.120 --> 51:44.400\n I mean, you literally can't stop.\n\n51:44.400 --> 51:48.000\n And we had spun around out of the landing area and we parked, we call it the six pack.\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:49.000\n So it's right in front of the Island.\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:52.560\n So if you see an aircraft carrier with the Island and the number of the ship on it, we're\n\n51:52.560 --> 51:54.940\n sitting right in front of that and we're looking at the landing area.\n\n51:54.940 --> 52:00.600\n So it's like you get front row seats to the concert and, and this, this, this EA six B\n\n52:00.600 --> 52:03.580\n comes in, you know, ugly pass.\n\n52:03.580 --> 52:05.760\n He ends up catching a one wire, which is the first one.\n\n52:05.760 --> 52:09.000\n You never want to catch the first one, which means you were not really high above the back\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:14.800\n of the ship when you landed and it comes in and the exhaust on an EA six or an a six actually\n\n52:14.800 --> 52:19.280\n points kind of down and it blows and it's blowing all the standing water on the aircraft.\n\n52:19.280 --> 52:20.280\n That's how hard it's raining.\n\n52:20.280 --> 52:21.640\n And you literally could not see across.\n\n52:21.640 --> 52:25.400\n I mean, I could see the front of my airplane, his airplane, and then it was just white because\n\n52:25.400 --> 52:27.600\n of the water being blown off the deck.\n\n52:27.600 --> 52:29.920\n And I'm shaking and I, I, I'll never forget.\n\n52:29.920 --> 52:33.800\n I looked over at Chris and I said, Oh my God, I go, Hey dude, man, 10,000 foot runway looks\n\n52:33.800 --> 52:35.400\n really good right now.\n\n52:35.400 --> 52:37.240\n And I go, and I'm, I'm shaking my hands like this.\n\n52:37.240 --> 52:40.040\n And I said, I'm not even, this is, I'm not faking this too.\n\n52:40.040 --> 52:42.520\n I know that's literally, I cannot stop shaking.\n\n52:42.520 --> 52:49.480\n I said, that scared the Evelyn out of me, but you, but it scares you afterwards.\n\n52:49.480 --> 52:52.280\n You don't, during it, you're not, I'm not, you don't have time to think about that.\n\n52:52.280 --> 52:53.280\n You're doing it.\n\n52:53.280 --> 52:58.080\n You got to do is we, you know, kind of the quote from Tom Hanks and what's that?\n\n52:58.080 --> 53:01.720\n The girls baseball movie where he goes, there's no crying in baseball.\n\n53:01.720 --> 53:03.160\n Well, that's our joke.\n\n53:03.160 --> 53:04.520\n There's no crying in Naval aviation.\n\n53:04.520 --> 53:08.240\n I said, you can fly around and cry all you want at night, but you know, there's only\n\n53:08.240 --> 53:10.320\n one pilot in those airplanes and you got to land it.\n\n53:10.320 --> 53:14.800\n So you cry all you want, wipe the tears away, you know, put on your big kid pants and it's,\n\n53:14.800 --> 53:18.680\n it's time to, it's time to, you know, man up and, and land that, land the jet.\n\n53:18.680 --> 53:25.200\n Sorry for the romantic question, but going back to the kid that dreamed to fly, what's\n\n53:25.200 --> 53:28.600\n it like to fly an airplane?\n\n53:28.600 --> 53:34.360\n What it looks incredible to me as a human, like a descendant of ape.\n\n53:34.360 --> 53:38.080\n I sit here on land and look up at you guys.\n\n53:38.080 --> 53:41.200\n It seems incredible that human being can do that.\n\n53:41.200 --> 53:43.520\n You know what people ask, you know, I'll be sitting around with my friends and they're\n\n53:43.520 --> 53:44.520\n like, how was it?\n\n53:44.520 --> 53:47.920\n I said, it's the greatest job on the planet.\n\n53:47.920 --> 53:54.640\n I said, you know, it's, it's an office with a view cause you're sitting in a glass.\n\n53:54.640 --> 53:58.160\n You can do you know, it's like roller coasters.\n\n53:58.160 --> 53:59.340\n You go, Oh, it does all these cool stuff.\n\n53:59.340 --> 54:03.120\n So we take people flying every once in a while and it's like, Oh yeah, I like rollercoaster.\n\n54:03.120 --> 54:07.320\n So I go, no, take any rollercoaster coolest rollercoaster you've ever been on and multiply\n\n54:07.320 --> 54:08.320\n it by a thousand.\n\n54:08.320 --> 54:14.560\n And I said, it's an experience you know, to put your body under, you know, you know, the\n\n54:14.560 --> 54:18.480\n jets rated at seven and a half, but it'll pull up to 8.1 before it overstresses depends\n\n54:18.480 --> 54:19.480\n on fuel weight.\n\n54:19.480 --> 54:25.960\n So, I mean, you routinely get up there towards eight G's to be able to do that to your body.\n\n54:25.960 --> 54:26.960\n I mean, it takes a toll.\n\n54:26.960 --> 54:31.960\n Like I can't really turn my head real good anymore and stuff like that, but would I trade\n\n54:31.960 --> 54:32.960\n it?\n\n54:32.960 --> 54:35.080\n It's a dream and how many people get to do that?\n\n54:35.080 --> 54:39.080\n You know, professional, I want to be an NFL, you know, and you end up to the NFL, which\n\n54:39.080 --> 54:45.360\n is a very small percentage with, well, I want to fly jets and to fly, you know, at the time\n\n54:45.360 --> 54:48.520\n when I was flying the Super Hornets that we had in our squad and we're brand new at like\n\n54:48.520 --> 54:52.320\n literally right out of the factory, I'd come off our first Super Hornet cruise.\n\n54:52.320 --> 54:55.720\n We had went to the Boeing factory in St. Louis where they were building my new jets that\n\n54:55.720 --> 54:56.720\n I was going to get.\n\n54:56.720 --> 55:00.080\n And I actually signed the inside of one of the wings while they were putting it together.\n\n55:00.080 --> 55:02.980\n So I'm meeting the people that are putting the jet together that's going to get delivered\n\n55:02.980 --> 55:05.600\n to me in a couple of months that I'm going to fly.\n\n55:05.600 --> 55:17.700\n So just, I mean, I'll tell you what, when I left, when I decided to walk away, I told\n\n55:17.700 --> 55:23.480\n myself I wouldn't, I promised myself that, you know, once you get through your O5 command,\n\n55:23.480 --> 55:26.840\n your flying really starts to tag to come down.\n\n55:26.840 --> 55:30.560\n You know, even if you, when you're an air wing commander, which is, we call them CAG,\n\n55:30.560 --> 55:35.600\n carrier group commander, you're not flying as much as like the normal pilots, nor should\n\n55:35.600 --> 55:36.600\n you be.\n\n55:36.600 --> 55:39.380\n I mean, there's young people that are coming up and it's training your relief because that's\n\n55:39.380 --> 55:40.380\n the next generation.\n\n55:40.380 --> 55:45.340\n So like currently I have friends of mine that we serve together.\n\n55:45.340 --> 55:48.240\n Their kids are flying Super Hornets, right?\n\n55:48.240 --> 55:53.460\n So to me, that's really neat because I watched them when they were little and now, you know,\n\n55:53.460 --> 55:58.780\n one of them who was good friends, I won't get his last name, but Joey, who lived down\n\n55:58.780 --> 56:04.480\n the street from us, was a Top Gun instructor and I'm like, hey, Joey's a Top Gun.\n\n56:04.480 --> 56:05.480\n You know?\n\n56:05.480 --> 56:08.220\n And I'm like, that's cool because, you know, I went there and I knew him, he would come\n\n56:08.220 --> 56:09.220\n down to my house.\n\n56:09.220 --> 56:13.340\n And now to see these kids that are, because typically military breeds military, you know,\n\n56:13.340 --> 56:14.340\n because the kids grow up in it.\n\n56:14.340 --> 56:19.000\n I mean, and I, the only reason that my son is not doing it is he's colorblind.\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:23.660\n So it disqualifies you for being a pilot, being a SEAL because he had talked about doing\n\n56:23.660 --> 56:29.320\n that because he's an incredible swimmer and he likes doing that stuff and water polo player.\n\n56:29.320 --> 56:34.580\n But he's, you know, both of my kids are, well, my daughter is a doctor and my son's in his\n\n56:34.580 --> 56:35.580\n third year.\n\n56:35.580 --> 56:36.580\n So.\n\n56:36.580 --> 56:42.420\n But there's a, I suppose, I mean, from my perspective, a bittersweet handover of this\n\n56:42.420 --> 56:46.180\n incredible experience of flying to the younger generation.\n\n56:46.180 --> 56:49.860\n So you don't, you told yourself you're not going to miss it.\n\n56:49.860 --> 56:50.860\n You miss it?\n\n56:50.860 --> 56:52.020\n There are days I do.\n\n56:52.020 --> 56:57.580\n When I hear jets, like if I'm around a base or a jet flies over, but I have all the memory\n\n56:57.580 --> 57:01.660\n so I can look at it and go, it can't go on forever.\n\n57:01.660 --> 57:05.560\n You know, Tom Brady can't play football, but there's going to come a time where he has\n\n57:05.560 --> 57:06.560\n to stop.\n\n57:06.560 --> 57:08.500\n He seems to have done it for a long time.\n\n57:08.500 --> 57:12.720\n But you know, typically when you look at it, you go, I had the opportunity.\n\n57:12.720 --> 57:18.460\n And I think as automation moves on, especially with AI that, you know, when will, when will\n\n57:18.460 --> 57:20.860\n the last man fighter be built?\n\n57:20.860 --> 57:23.620\n You know, and that's that big question, you know, we just did F 35.\n\n57:23.620 --> 57:25.020\n It's over budget.\n\n57:25.020 --> 57:26.820\n It's seven years late.\n\n57:26.820 --> 57:29.180\n There's all kinds of issues when we try and do it.\n\n57:29.180 --> 57:32.540\n And then you look at some of the new stuff that's coming out that the air force is working\n\n57:32.540 --> 57:39.740\n on with smaller, cheaper, uh, a trittable platforms that you can go, Oh, we can, because\n\n57:39.740 --> 57:44.820\n if you don't put a man in the box or a person, because there's a lot of incredibly talented\n\n57:44.820 --> 57:47.220\n women that do this too.\n\n57:47.220 --> 57:48.460\n So I'll just say that as person.\n\n57:48.460 --> 57:49.460\n Yeah.\n\n57:49.460 --> 57:54.040\n So we say man and he, we mean both men and women because offline you've told me about\n\n57:54.040 --> 57:55.620\n a lot of incredible women that flown.\n\n57:55.620 --> 58:01.660\n So I had, I had three, three female, actually four, one of them didn't fly anymore.\n\n58:01.660 --> 58:03.540\n She actually lives right around here.\n\n58:03.540 --> 58:09.060\n She, she's a, she ended up going into aircraft maintenance when she couldn't fly anymore.\n\n58:09.060 --> 58:15.020\n One of the girls who everyone knows is incredibly, she's one of the most gifted people I've ever\n\n58:15.020 --> 58:16.020\n met in my life.\n\n58:16.020 --> 58:17.540\n She is the vice president of Amazon air.\n\n58:17.540 --> 58:21.140\n You can see her on TV, her name's Sarah, uh, incredible.\n\n58:21.140 --> 58:24.860\n And then I had a page who ended up taking command.\n\n58:24.860 --> 58:27.380\n She got out of fighters and went into other platforms.\n\n58:27.380 --> 58:29.380\n Um, and she was a commanding officer.\n\n58:29.380 --> 58:36.100\n And then the other one is a, um, teaches leadership and she is all three of them, actually all\n\n58:36.100 --> 58:38.100\n four of the women that were direct.\n\n58:38.100 --> 58:42.820\n Uh, I'm hoping not forgetting, I don't think I'm forgetting someone, uh, incredibly, incredibly\n\n58:42.820 --> 58:45.780\n talented, uh, and a great addition to the ready room.\n\n58:45.780 --> 58:48.280\n So anyone that gets into the, Oh, you know, women can't do it.\n\n58:48.280 --> 58:49.420\n That's all total horse crap.\n\n58:49.420 --> 58:53.380\n Hey, you know, we can talk about the original integration and stuff, which was not done\n\n58:53.380 --> 58:56.020\n well by the military nor the Navy.\n\n58:56.020 --> 58:58.540\n So women can fly as good as the guys.\n\n58:58.540 --> 58:59.540\n Yeah.\n\n58:59.540 --> 59:02.500\n You can't tell if you pass another airplane, you can't tell if there's a man or woman in\n\n59:02.500 --> 59:03.500\n it.\n\n59:03.500 --> 59:10.820\n It comes down to, uh, stick and throttle the ability to, uh, uh, extrapolate where the\n\n59:10.820 --> 59:12.860\n vehicle is going to be, where the airplane would be.\n\n59:12.860 --> 59:15.460\n If you're fighting another one, you have to be able to think fast.\n\n59:15.460 --> 59:17.880\n Anyone has those characteristics, uh, can do it.\n\n59:17.880 --> 59:22.140\n And then I think most important besides that there has to be a desire.\n\n59:22.140 --> 59:24.780\n And I'm not saying that everyone, if you took, cause we used to track.\n\n59:24.780 --> 59:27.980\n So when I ran, we call it the rag, it's the replacement air group.\n\n59:27.980 --> 59:31.580\n It's where, so the, the super Hornet training squadron, there's two of them.\n\n59:31.580 --> 59:33.500\n There's one on the East coast at one Oh six.\n\n59:33.500 --> 59:37.740\n And there's one on the West coast, which is VFA one 22, one 22 is the first one.\n\n59:37.740 --> 59:41.500\n So I ended up going there and I ended up being the operations officer and training officer.\n\n59:41.500 --> 59:42.500\n Okay.\n\n59:42.500 --> 59:45.060\n So we tracked the last hundred students.\n\n59:45.060 --> 59:46.060\n Right.\n\n59:46.060 --> 59:51.000\n So everyone goes, ah, it's funny to hear students talk cause Oh, he's awesome.\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:54.880\n If you took the hundred, there's three at the top of the list that are just naturally\n\n59:54.880 --> 59:56.220\n gifted aviators.\n\n59:56.220 --> 59:58.040\n They're well, well, well above average.\n\n59:58.040 --> 1:00:01.500\n It's like the person in a math class that sits down in complex math and they just get\n\n1:00:01.500 --> 1:00:02.500\n it.\n\n1:00:02.500 --> 1:00:06.660\n You know, at the bottom, there's the three at the bottom that are going to struggle and\n\n1:00:06.660 --> 1:00:08.540\n there's a good chance they won't get out.\n\n1:00:08.540 --> 1:00:12.740\n And if they do get out, they're going to have to work really hard to just maintain kind\n\n1:00:12.740 --> 1:00:14.120\n of average.\n\n1:00:14.120 --> 1:00:15.340\n Sometimes it's just the way your mind works.\n\n1:00:15.340 --> 1:00:17.180\n Not everyone is good at everything.\n\n1:00:17.180 --> 1:00:22.820\n If you took the 94 of them in the middle, they're within one mean deviation of, you\n\n1:00:22.820 --> 1:00:23.820\n know, it's there.\n\n1:00:23.820 --> 1:00:27.060\n They're all, you know, it's a, the bell curve doesn't look real good.\n\n1:00:27.060 --> 1:00:30.620\n It's just a big hump and it comes back down and everyone's right there within one mean\n\n1:00:30.620 --> 1:00:32.300\n deviation.\n\n1:00:32.300 --> 1:00:35.260\n And then you have the outliers, usually not on the high side because they're going to\n\n1:00:35.260 --> 1:00:39.140\n get through, but the outliers on the low side that don't make it through.\n\n1:00:39.140 --> 1:00:43.060\n So for the most part, the Navy does a really good job, as does the Air Force, of screening.\n\n1:00:43.060 --> 1:00:46.520\n So now what they do, when I went, you just showed up and you started.\n\n1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:51.860\n Now what you do is you actually go fly Piper Warriors low wing to see, are you adaptable\n\n1:00:51.860 --> 1:00:52.860\n to this?\n\n1:00:52.860 --> 1:00:57.160\n And there's an evaluation that goes through and then if you hit a certain mark, then you're\n\n1:00:57.160 --> 1:00:59.220\n good to go and then they put you into primary.\n\n1:00:59.220 --> 1:01:03.500\n It's kind of like a, it's like a precheck, you know, like the preset, the pre SAT to\n\n1:01:03.500 --> 1:01:05.140\n go, Hey, how am I going to do on the SAT?\n\n1:01:05.140 --> 1:01:09.100\n It's, it's, it's very similar to that, but it's more of a hand skill.\n\n1:01:09.100 --> 1:01:10.100\n Can you adapt?\n\n1:01:10.100 --> 1:01:13.860\n Because although we live in three dimensions, like this table is not, you know, we, this\n\n1:01:13.860 --> 1:01:19.040\n is, you know, this is all has depth with all that, uh, where it's really relative to aviation.\n\n1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:20.860\n We are two dimensional.\n\n1:01:20.860 --> 1:01:21.860\n Very two dimensional.\n\n1:01:21.860 --> 1:01:23.380\n Can you, can you explain that?\n\n1:01:23.380 --> 1:01:29.020\n So our perception is actually more limited than the, than that of an aviator.\n\n1:01:29.020 --> 1:01:30.020\n Very much.\n\n1:01:30.020 --> 1:01:31.020\n And here's why.\n\n1:01:31.020 --> 1:01:32.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:01:32.020 --> 1:01:33.380\n So we look at, uh, let's look at a tall building.\n\n1:01:33.380 --> 1:01:36.500\n Let's look at one world trade center in New York cause that's the, everyone knows what\n\n1:01:36.500 --> 1:01:37.500\n it looks like.\n\n1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:38.500\n Big tall building.\n\n1:01:38.500 --> 1:01:42.540\n Um, it's what, maybe 1800 feet tall.\n\n1:01:42.540 --> 1:01:45.380\n Even the Burj Al Dubai, which is like what 20 some hundred feet tall.\n\n1:01:45.380 --> 1:01:46.620\n It's not that big.\n\n1:01:46.620 --> 1:01:51.380\n So a Super Hornet to do a, what a split S is, which is I'm flying, I'm just going to\n\n1:01:51.380 --> 1:01:56.060\n roll the airplane upside down and then I'm going to do basically a C the letter C I'm\n\n1:01:56.060 --> 1:01:58.180\n going to go in the top and out the bottom.\n\n1:01:58.180 --> 1:02:01.240\n So and I'm just against basically a vertical displacement of the airplane.\n\n1:02:01.240 --> 1:02:03.780\n So I'm going from high to low.\n\n1:02:03.780 --> 1:02:08.780\n It's very, very tight and it doesn't in about roughly about 2,500 feet, give or take a little.\n\n1:02:08.780 --> 1:02:12.540\n So you go, that is, that is a really tight vertical turn.\n\n1:02:12.540 --> 1:02:13.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:13.540 --> 1:02:17.180\n For example, the a six in order to do that was about 9,000 feet.\n\n1:02:17.180 --> 1:02:20.500\n And we look at a building that's 2000 feet high and think that is tall.\n\n1:02:20.500 --> 1:02:21.500\n Right.\n\n1:02:21.500 --> 1:02:22.500\n All right.\n\n1:02:22.500 --> 1:02:25.920\n So in, in aviation sense, when you're starting to do vertical displacement numbers going\n\n1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:30.780\n from 35,000 feet down to 20,000 feet in a matter of seconds and maneuvering the airplane,\n\n1:02:30.780 --> 1:02:33.700\n because the human brain thinks we really are.\n\n1:02:33.700 --> 1:02:34.700\n We like to be flat.\n\n1:02:34.700 --> 1:02:35.700\n I see what you mean.\n\n1:02:35.700 --> 1:02:36.700\n We think 2d.\n\n1:02:36.700 --> 1:02:40.780\n So if I'm fighting, how you really get an advantage when you're fighting another airplane\n\n1:02:40.780 --> 1:02:45.380\n is to work in the vertical, because most people will do like one move in the vertical and\n\n1:02:45.380 --> 1:02:47.940\n then they want to start to flatten out because that's where we're comfortable.\n\n1:02:47.940 --> 1:02:48.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:48.940 --> 1:02:49.940\n So they're profound.\n\n1:02:49.940 --> 1:02:55.460\n Do you still think in like stacks of 2d layers or no, or do you, do you truly start to think\n\n1:02:55.460 --> 1:03:03.860\n in that third dimension, like the rich 3d world of, uh, like of, of fighting that can,\n\n1:03:03.860 --> 1:03:09.220\n do you start to actually be able to really experience the 3d nature?\n\n1:03:09.220 --> 1:03:11.200\n You do because you have to project where you're going to be.\n\n1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:14.780\n So you have to know the performance of the airplane knowing that, Hey, if I do this maneuver\n\n1:03:14.780 --> 1:03:18.660\n that I am going to go, it's, it's kind of like when I, when I talk about when we were\n\n1:03:18.660 --> 1:03:20.100\n chasing the Tic Tac.\n\n1:03:20.100 --> 1:03:23.700\n So the Tic Tacs coming up and I'm at about, you know, and I've been doing this for at\n\n1:03:23.700 --> 1:03:25.660\n the time, 16 years.\n\n1:03:25.660 --> 1:03:27.880\n So I'm looking and I'm going, Hey, I'm here.\n\n1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:29.380\n He's there on the other side of the circle.\n\n1:03:29.380 --> 1:03:30.820\n I'm going to do a vertical displacement.\n\n1:03:30.820 --> 1:03:31.820\n I'm going to go like this.\n\n1:03:31.820 --> 1:03:33.780\n I'm going to cut across the circle and I'm not going to him.\n\n1:03:33.780 --> 1:03:34.780\n I'm going out in front of him.\n\n1:03:34.780 --> 1:03:37.900\n I'm going over here because I know that by the time I get through this maneuver, that's\n\n1:03:37.900 --> 1:03:38.900\n where he's going to be.\n\n1:03:38.900 --> 1:03:40.980\n And I'm trying to, you know, basically join up on him.\n\n1:03:40.980 --> 1:03:44.820\n But I also had to look at it to go, do I have enough altitude to do this?\n\n1:03:44.820 --> 1:03:47.540\n Because what I did before here and I do this, I'm going to end up over here and he's going\n\n1:03:47.540 --> 1:03:48.540\n to be above me.\n\n1:03:48.540 --> 1:03:51.620\n And then, you know, I have to get that energy back to get up to him.\n\n1:03:51.620 --> 1:03:54.540\n And when you're doing a max performance, it's a trade.\n\n1:03:54.540 --> 1:03:59.120\n So you have, this is, this is really important when you're, when you're fighting airplanes\n\n1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:01.240\n and you're really max performing.\n\n1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:05.180\n So when you go to an air show and you see the air demo, he's literally playing with\n\n1:04:05.180 --> 1:04:06.180\n it.\n\n1:04:06.180 --> 1:04:07.380\n He's got a finite amount of energy, right?\n\n1:04:07.380 --> 1:04:10.220\n He can add some with the motors and stuff, but you're, what you're really doing is it's\n\n1:04:10.220 --> 1:04:15.160\n a trade off and you can trade off kinetic energy, speed for altitude, which gives you\n\n1:04:15.160 --> 1:04:16.640\n potential energy.\n\n1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:21.020\n The other piece is, is I can trade some of that kinetic energy for performance.\n\n1:04:21.020 --> 1:04:24.320\n Because I know if I do a nice, easy turn, the airplane will make it at what doesn't\n\n1:04:24.320 --> 1:04:25.620\n bleed energy.\n\n1:04:25.620 --> 1:04:30.080\n But I know if I do a real tight, that 2,500 foot split S, that it's going to cost me energy.\n\n1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:34.040\n So if I enter the split S at 200 knots and I do it right, I'm going to come out at the\n\n1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:35.540\n bottom at probably 200 knots.\n\n1:04:35.540 --> 1:04:41.340\n Although I lost 2,500 feet of potential energy, I converted that to that, to kinetic and that\n\n1:04:41.340 --> 1:04:45.900\n kinetic was transitioned and bled off the wings in order for me to get that high performance\n\n1:04:45.900 --> 1:04:46.900\n turn.\n\n1:04:46.900 --> 1:04:51.500\n So you've got to constantly evaluate where you're at and it's your overall energy package.\n\n1:04:51.500 --> 1:04:55.360\n So you can have a guy that's behind you that looks like he's going to kill you.\n\n1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:59.780\n But if this jet is at 400 knots and this jet is at 110 knots, this jet's just going to\n\n1:04:59.780 --> 1:05:03.820\n pull away, drive around and kill him in about 30 seconds.\n\n1:05:03.820 --> 1:05:08.340\n It's overall energy package and that's that you've got to be constantly evaluating where\n\n1:05:08.340 --> 1:05:09.340\n you're at.\n\n1:05:09.340 --> 1:05:10.340\n And this is that 80% solution.\n\n1:05:10.340 --> 1:05:11.340\n Can I afford to do this or not?\n\n1:05:11.340 --> 1:05:12.340\n Yes, no.\n\n1:05:12.340 --> 1:05:13.340\n And you have literally a split second to make the decision.\n\n1:05:13.340 --> 1:05:18.060\n That's the most incredible dance of human decision making.\n\n1:05:18.060 --> 1:05:19.060\n It's just incredible.\n\n1:05:19.060 --> 1:05:23.260\n I know a million people want me to talk about Tic Tac and I definitely will, but let me\n\n1:05:23.260 --> 1:05:29.820\n ask the one last ridiculous, subjective question.\n\n1:05:29.820 --> 1:05:35.740\n What's the greatest plane ever made in history?\n\n1:05:35.740 --> 1:05:36.740\n You don't get to like...\n\n1:05:36.740 --> 1:05:40.540\n From Pure Speed, I would say SR71, I think it's an engineering marvel that was actually\n\n1:05:40.540 --> 1:05:44.220\n developed in the fifties by Kelly Johnson, Skunk Works.\n\n1:05:44.220 --> 1:05:46.980\n For what that was able to do, and then when you get into history of it, you know how they\n\n1:05:46.980 --> 1:05:49.240\n actually built...\n\n1:05:49.240 --> 1:05:54.480\n The CIA actually made like six companies in order to buy the titanium from Russia to bring\n\n1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:58.740\n it back and build an airplane out of titanium that we would fly over Russia.\n\n1:05:58.740 --> 1:06:00.700\n To me, that's an incredible...\n\n1:06:00.700 --> 1:06:01.700\n Engineering marvel.\n\n1:06:01.700 --> 1:06:03.700\n I think that like the X15, you know...\n\n1:06:03.700 --> 1:06:13.260\n By the way, the SR71 still holds the speed record of any plane as far as I can understand.\n\n1:06:13.260 --> 1:06:14.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:14.260 --> 1:06:15.660\n What's funny when you get into it is it's...\n\n1:06:15.660 --> 1:06:18.260\n Remember, fast is relative.\n\n1:06:18.260 --> 1:06:24.260\n When I say that, I mean, so if you're going 3000 miles an hour, a hundred feet above the\n\n1:06:24.260 --> 1:06:30.220\n ground, you're going 3000 miles an hour through, you know, that's how fast you're going.\n\n1:06:30.220 --> 1:06:34.860\n When you get up to altitude, there's an indicated airspeed and there's, you know, your ground\n\n1:06:34.860 --> 1:06:35.860\n speed.\n\n1:06:35.860 --> 1:06:38.900\n So your indicated airspeed is really how fast the air is going past your airplane.\n\n1:06:38.900 --> 1:06:44.820\n Well, the air is so thin up there, you may only be showing like 300 knots.\n\n1:06:44.820 --> 1:06:48.820\n But at 300 knots, you're really doing 2,500 miles an hour over the ground.\n\n1:06:48.820 --> 1:06:53.780\n So you know, like we would take the airplanes up to 50,000 feet when we had to do full the\n\n1:06:53.780 --> 1:06:55.500\n maintenance check flights on them.\n\n1:06:55.500 --> 1:07:00.500\n So when you're doing 200, you know, in some odd knots, it's actually slow for the airplane.\n\n1:07:00.500 --> 1:07:04.060\n It's, you know, you're getting, you know, it's kind of like, it's not, you know, there's\n\n1:07:04.060 --> 1:07:05.100\n maneuvering speeds.\n\n1:07:05.100 --> 1:07:08.980\n You know that if I hit a certain speed in a Super Hornet, that I have the full capability\n\n1:07:08.980 --> 1:07:09.980\n of the airfoil.\n\n1:07:09.980 --> 1:07:13.540\n If I'm below that speed, I'm going to stall the airfoil before I get to the maximum G.\n\n1:07:13.540 --> 1:07:15.620\n Okay?\n\n1:07:15.620 --> 1:07:19.940\n So when you look at something like that, you go, well, is it really going fast?\n\n1:07:19.940 --> 1:07:24.500\n When you look at an SR71 that's flying upwards of, you know, 70 plus thousand feet, the air's\n\n1:07:24.500 --> 1:07:29.500\n so thin, you know, just like the X15, you can get to a much higher speed, but the relative\n\n1:07:29.500 --> 1:07:32.700\n speed of the air going over you is actually relatively low.\n\n1:07:32.700 --> 1:07:36.260\n So the stresses on the airframe are not like they would be if you were down low.\n\n1:07:36.260 --> 1:07:40.140\n But because you're going fast to get enough air over your pedostatic system to show that\n\n1:07:40.140 --> 1:07:43.380\n you're going 300 knots, you're screaming.\n\n1:07:43.380 --> 1:07:49.000\n I mean, the fastest I ever got was, I was with the, well, soon to be Vice Admiral White.\n\n1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:53.940\n So we had taken a check flight and I got it up to 1.78.\n\n1:07:53.940 --> 1:07:57.740\n I got a Super Hornet up to Mach 1.78 and it was, and we were just right by Pebble Beach\n\n1:07:57.740 --> 1:07:58.740\n too.\n\n1:07:58.740 --> 1:07:59.740\n And then...\n\n1:07:59.740 --> 1:08:00.740\n What's that feel like?\n\n1:08:00.740 --> 1:08:01.740\n Or is it just like...\n\n1:08:01.740 --> 1:08:04.740\n When you get that fast, it started, to me, it got a little bit weird because you realize\n\n1:08:04.740 --> 1:08:08.220\n in your brain, and I did, that there's no out.\n\n1:08:08.220 --> 1:08:10.500\n If something happens, I can't eject.\n\n1:08:10.500 --> 1:08:11.700\n The ejection would kill me.\n\n1:08:11.700 --> 1:08:13.740\n Isn't that kind of liberating in a way?\n\n1:08:13.740 --> 1:08:14.740\n Or no?\n\n1:08:14.740 --> 1:08:15.740\n Okay, maybe not.\n\n1:08:15.740 --> 1:08:17.660\n You always want to push the limit.\n\n1:08:17.660 --> 1:08:20.180\n You know, it's like how fast, I could have got it going faster.\n\n1:08:20.180 --> 1:08:24.260\n It was literally still accelerating when I stopped, but I had, it was fuel limited and\n\n1:08:24.260 --> 1:08:29.740\n space limited because I'm off the coast of California, Big Sur, and I'm going and I can\n\n1:08:29.740 --> 1:08:32.820\n see Pebble Beach out in the distance, the whole Monterey Peninsula.\n\n1:08:32.820 --> 1:08:34.220\n You're just going fast.\n\n1:08:34.220 --> 1:08:36.780\n And you're doing almost 18 miles a minute.\n\n1:08:36.780 --> 1:08:38.340\n I mean, you're screaming.\n\n1:08:38.340 --> 1:08:39.340\n Yeah.\n\n1:08:39.340 --> 1:08:40.340\n I mean, that's...\n\n1:08:40.340 --> 1:08:41.340\n And then you have to turn...\n\n1:08:41.340 --> 1:08:42.460\n Well, the airplane didn't have anything on it.\n\n1:08:42.460 --> 1:08:45.060\n It was a slicked off Super Hornet, so it was basically just the airplane.\n\n1:08:45.060 --> 1:08:47.500\n No pylons, no pods, no nothing.\n\n1:08:47.500 --> 1:08:50.460\n And then we had to get it turned around because we got to go to the exit point for the area.\n\n1:08:50.460 --> 1:08:53.620\n And I'm trying to get it down below to subsonic.\n\n1:08:53.620 --> 1:08:56.980\n And there's a bunch of things that are disabled, like the speed brakes that normally we pop\n\n1:08:56.980 --> 1:08:59.860\n out when you're going that fast, they don't, because the Super Hornet really doesn't have\n\n1:08:59.860 --> 1:09:03.700\n speed brakes, it deforms the flight controls.\n\n1:09:03.700 --> 1:09:04.700\n They don't function.\n\n1:09:04.700 --> 1:09:08.540\n So you really, you're trying to maneuver and when you're going that fast, you can't turn\n\n1:09:08.540 --> 1:09:14.420\n because a 7G turn at 1.5 Mach is a pretty big turn.\n\n1:09:14.420 --> 1:09:16.300\n So it's just, it's crazy.\n\n1:09:16.300 --> 1:09:21.980\n It's incredible that a human can do this and a human can engineer the system which allows\n\n1:09:21.980 --> 1:09:24.940\n another human to control that system.\n\n1:09:24.940 --> 1:09:29.460\n To me, I think it's a great experience.\n\n1:09:29.460 --> 1:09:31.660\n Was it sad to see the SR71 go?\n\n1:09:31.660 --> 1:09:33.260\n I think it was during your career.\n\n1:09:33.260 --> 1:09:37.660\n I mean, do you guys romanticize the different planes?\n\n1:09:37.660 --> 1:09:38.660\n We would see it flying.\n\n1:09:38.660 --> 1:09:44.060\n When I was flying Hornets, because West Coast flies and it's called R2508, which covers\n\n1:09:44.060 --> 1:09:47.240\n the Navy China Lake area and Edwards.\n\n1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:48.240\n It's a huge area.\n\n1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:51.680\n It's actually, I think, we had a guy from Switzerland come out because they had Hornets\n\n1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:55.020\n and he's like, this is bigger than our whole country, because it's a pretty big area in\n\n1:09:55.020 --> 1:09:59.580\n California that you fly, but you would see the SR71s, they had a loop because NASA was\n\n1:09:59.580 --> 1:10:03.380\n flying them out of Palmdale and they would take off and they'd go up towards Washington\n\n1:10:03.380 --> 1:10:05.540\n State and Montana and they'd do a loop.\n\n1:10:05.540 --> 1:10:10.420\n So you'd see them coming back down, they'd descend above 60,000, they'd get contrails,\n\n1:10:10.420 --> 1:10:13.580\n the white lines behind airplanes, they'd come down and hit the tanker and then they'd go\n\n1:10:13.580 --> 1:10:14.580\n back up.\n\n1:10:14.580 --> 1:10:18.380\n So it was cool to be able to see them in my lifetime flying.\n\n1:10:18.380 --> 1:10:27.980\n But I think with money, age, the advent of satellites, because they're everywhere now,\n\n1:10:27.980 --> 1:10:32.780\n I mean, you've got commercial companies putting satellites up, how much of that need was really\n\n1:10:32.780 --> 1:10:33.780\n there?\n\n1:10:33.780 --> 1:10:35.460\n Because you've got to remember when those things started in the 50s, Sputnik wasn't\n\n1:10:35.460 --> 1:10:37.380\n flying around.\n\n1:10:37.380 --> 1:10:41.380\n It was the U2 and the SR71 that were out there doing that work.\n\n1:10:41.380 --> 1:10:45.740\n So at the time it was needed, if you think about it really, it was an incredible feat\n\n1:10:45.740 --> 1:10:47.220\n of aviation for that time.\n\n1:10:47.220 --> 1:10:51.340\n I mean, literally we have yet to pass that and then you also ask, well, is there a need\n\n1:10:51.340 --> 1:10:52.340\n to pass that?\n\n1:10:52.340 --> 1:10:55.940\n I go, I don't know, we got stuff in space, so do we need to make an airplane that goes\n\n1:10:55.940 --> 1:10:56.940\n that fast?\n\n1:10:56.940 --> 1:11:00.620\n I think the next one is you get into the hypersonics where you don't have to put a person in,\n\n1:11:00.620 --> 1:11:01.780\n it does all kinds of crazy stuff.\n\n1:11:01.780 --> 1:11:05.380\n And all the work with automation, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:11:05.380 --> 1:11:11.260\n So one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is you happen to be one of, at least in\n\n1:11:11.260 --> 1:11:19.460\n my view, one of the most credible witnesses in history of somebody who's witnessed a UFO\n\n1:11:19.460 --> 1:11:23.540\n literally an identified flying object.\n\n1:11:23.540 --> 1:11:27.900\n And not only witnessed, but got to, how do you put it?\n\n1:11:27.900 --> 1:11:28.900\n Like chase it, essentially?\n\n1:11:28.900 --> 1:11:29.900\n Chase it.\n\n1:11:29.900 --> 1:11:31.420\n Chase it.\n\n1:11:31.420 --> 1:11:36.060\n So let me just lay out, I think it's easier than you telling the story.\n\n1:11:36.060 --> 1:11:41.260\n Maybe me and my dumb simpleton ways trying to explain the stories, I understand it.\n\n1:11:41.260 --> 1:11:43.540\n And then maybe you can correct me.\n\n1:11:43.540 --> 1:11:53.000\n So on November 10th, 2004, the USS Princeton, which is one of the carriers.\n\n1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.000\n That's a cruiser.\n\n1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:55.000\n It's a cruiser.\n\n1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:56.000\n It's a cruiser.\n\n1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:57.000\n So you can't land on a.\n\n1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.500\n No, helicopter, it has a helicopter pad on the back.\n\n1:11:59.500 --> 1:12:00.500\n Gotcha.\n\n1:12:00.500 --> 1:12:01.500\n And it has weapons on it.\n\n1:12:01.500 --> 1:12:02.500\n Okay, gotcha.\n\n1:12:02.500 --> 1:12:03.500\n It shoots the missiles up.\n\n1:12:03.500 --> 1:12:04.500\n But it has a nice radar.\n\n1:12:04.500 --> 1:12:08.460\n It has an incredible spy one system phased array, four panels.\n\n1:12:08.460 --> 1:12:09.940\n So it looks in quadrants.\n\n1:12:09.940 --> 1:12:10.940\n Perfect.\n\n1:12:10.940 --> 1:12:16.460\n So they started noticing on November 10th that there is a few objects flying around\n\n1:12:16.460 --> 1:12:22.780\n at 28,000 feet with speed of what I guess is considered a low speed of 120 miles an\n\n1:12:22.780 --> 1:12:23.780\n hour.\n\n1:12:23.780 --> 1:12:28.180\n Don't know what that's in knots, but on the coast of California.\n\n1:12:28.180 --> 1:12:32.140\n And they kept detecting these objects for just about a week.\n\n1:12:32.140 --> 1:12:42.300\n Then comes in like your part of the story, which is on November 14th from the, I guess\n\n1:12:42.300 --> 1:12:45.300\n it's from the USS Nimitz.\n\n1:12:45.300 --> 1:12:54.020\n You flew and witnessed a 40 foot long white Tic Tac shaped object with no wings flying\n\n1:12:54.020 --> 1:12:56.820\n in ways you've never thought possible.\n\n1:12:56.820 --> 1:13:01.940\n And in some interview somewhere, you said, I think it was not from this world.\n\n1:13:01.940 --> 1:13:07.660\n So there's a mysterious aspect to this object, to this entire situation.\n\n1:13:07.660 --> 1:13:09.460\n There's videos involved.\n\n1:13:09.460 --> 1:13:20.060\n The video of a flare forward looking infrared receiver has also the visible lights.\n\n1:13:20.060 --> 1:13:23.060\n You can switch as a TV mode.\n\n1:13:23.060 --> 1:13:27.100\n So that gives you visible light and then as an IR mode.\n\n1:13:27.100 --> 1:13:30.300\n And Chad Underwood recorded that video.\n\n1:13:30.300 --> 1:13:33.300\n And those are the videos that were released by the Pentagon later.\n\n1:13:33.300 --> 1:13:42.460\n One of the three videos, the two other videos, go fast and gimbal were recorded in 2000 something\n\n1:13:42.460 --> 1:13:50.840\n 14 and 15 on the East coast of the United States that had different kinds of objects,\n\n1:13:50.840 --> 1:13:57.840\n but they're weird in the same kind of way in terms of at least the videos and the experiences\n\n1:13:57.840 --> 1:14:03.980\n that people have described were similar in the degree of weirdness.\n\n1:14:03.980 --> 1:14:12.180\n But the differences is actually on the East coast of 2014 case, very few people have spoken\n\n1:14:12.180 --> 1:14:13.300\n about it.\n\n1:14:13.300 --> 1:14:16.760\n And even in your situation, very few people have spoken about it.\n\n1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:24.500\n So there's a mystery to it, but it's in some sense, it's a quite simple story without much\n\n1:14:24.500 --> 1:14:26.780\n resolution to the mystery.\n\n1:14:26.780 --> 1:14:29.060\n And it's fascinating.\n\n1:14:29.060 --> 1:14:31.580\n And there's a lot of opinions.\n\n1:14:31.580 --> 1:14:37.300\n There's division of opinions because it's a mysterious, I mean, it's truly is a UFO\n\n1:14:37.300 --> 1:14:45.420\n in the sense that UAP, unidentified aerial phenomena.\n\n1:14:45.420 --> 1:14:51.080\n So can you maybe correct me on any of the things I've gotten wrong, elaborate on some\n\n1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:54.140\n key things and describe that experience in general.\n\n1:14:54.140 --> 1:14:55.220\n So here's what I know.\n\n1:14:55.220 --> 1:15:03.540\n So yeah, we went out on our mission to go train and they canceled the mission and they\n\n1:15:03.540 --> 1:15:04.540\n sent us down.\n\n1:15:04.540 --> 1:15:05.540\n There's all kinds of rumors out here.\n\n1:15:05.540 --> 1:15:09.740\n There's all kinds of, after this has come out, so originally it was the four of us.\n\n1:15:09.740 --> 1:15:15.320\n There's two jets, two people in each jet, they're F18Fs, okay?\n\n1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:17.380\n There is no video from our event.\n\n1:15:17.380 --> 1:15:19.740\n It was all four sets of eyeballs staring at this thing.\n\n1:15:19.740 --> 1:15:24.160\n And then when we came back and told it when Chad and his pilot took off, that's when Chad\n\n1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:25.300\n got the video of it.\n\n1:15:25.300 --> 1:15:26.580\n And we're like, that's it.\n\n1:15:26.580 --> 1:15:27.580\n That's exactly it.\n\n1:15:27.580 --> 1:15:28.580\n That's it.\n\n1:15:28.580 --> 1:15:32.980\n So when you say eyeballs, you mean literally your eyes are seeing a thing?\n\n1:15:32.980 --> 1:15:33.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:33.980 --> 1:15:35.780\n So as we're flying out, we get vectored.\n\n1:15:35.780 --> 1:15:37.380\n They come up and tell us, hey, we're going to cancel training.\n\n1:15:37.380 --> 1:15:38.580\n This is a USS Princeton.\n\n1:15:38.580 --> 1:15:40.360\n So this is a Aegis Cruiser.\n\n1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:47.580\n So we're talking to one controller who is like, hey, sir, first you ask what ordinance\n\n1:15:47.580 --> 1:15:48.580\n we have on board.\n\n1:15:48.580 --> 1:15:52.300\n And I laugh because we don't carry live ordinance in training typically because bad stuff happens.\n\n1:15:52.300 --> 1:15:55.300\n Usually someone forgets to put a switch on and then the missile comes off and hits a\n\n1:15:55.300 --> 1:15:58.100\n good airplane and it's not good.\n\n1:15:58.100 --> 1:16:02.060\n So we had what's called a Catam 9, which is really just a blue two with the AIM 9 seeker\n\n1:16:02.060 --> 1:16:05.460\n on the front of it, which is an IR missile.\n\n1:16:05.460 --> 1:16:06.660\n So there's only two ways to get it off.\n\n1:16:06.660 --> 1:16:07.900\n You can beat it off with a sledgehammer.\n\n1:16:07.900 --> 1:16:11.380\n You can take this thing and you put a wrench in it and it unlocks the lugs and pulls the\n\n1:16:11.380 --> 1:16:13.180\n lugs back in that hold it on.\n\n1:16:13.180 --> 1:16:16.860\n When it really fires the impulse from the engine, actually throws the lugs forward and\n\n1:16:16.860 --> 1:16:19.340\n breaks that release and it comes off down the rail.\n\n1:16:19.340 --> 1:16:21.300\n That's how it works.\n\n1:16:21.300 --> 1:16:24.020\n So they said, hey, well, we have real world tasking.\n\n1:16:24.020 --> 1:16:30.380\n So as we're going out, my wingman, the other pilot, she maneuvers the airplane to the left\n\n1:16:30.380 --> 1:16:31.700\n hand side of me.\n\n1:16:31.700 --> 1:16:36.580\n So she's kind of stepped up like this and I'll use your mic box to start.\n\n1:16:36.580 --> 1:16:40.220\n So as we're going out, they're calling ranges are called bra calls, bearing range and altitude.\n\n1:16:40.220 --> 1:16:44.980\n And they're telling us, hey, it's at 40 miles or 50 miles and 40 miles and 30 miles.\n\n1:16:44.980 --> 1:16:49.880\n So they're saying, hey, two, seven, zero, 30, 20,000, that's all they say.\n\n1:16:49.880 --> 1:16:55.320\n So we got our radars and we had to mechanically scan radars at the time, APG 73.\n\n1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:58.340\n Good piece of gear, APG 79, new one's way better.\n\n1:16:58.340 --> 1:16:59.340\n But anyway.\n\n1:16:59.340 --> 1:17:04.060\n And I apologize if I interrupt the story, hopefully it's useful, but they're telling\n\n1:17:04.060 --> 1:17:06.780\n you a location of a thing that you should look at.\n\n1:17:06.780 --> 1:17:08.580\n They're telling us they have a contact on their radar.\n\n1:17:08.580 --> 1:17:09.580\n They don't know what it is.\n\n1:17:09.580 --> 1:17:10.580\n They just have a blip.\n\n1:17:10.580 --> 1:17:11.580\n They have a little blip.\n\n1:17:11.580 --> 1:17:14.540\n Well, they've been watching these things and what he told me is they had been looking at\n\n1:17:14.540 --> 1:17:15.540\n these things as we're driving.\n\n1:17:15.540 --> 1:17:17.300\n He says, sir, we've been tracking these things for about two weeks.\n\n1:17:17.300 --> 1:17:18.900\n That's we had been at sea for two weeks.\n\n1:17:18.900 --> 1:17:21.380\n This is the first time we've had planes airborne.\n\n1:17:21.380 --> 1:17:22.700\n We want you to go see what these are.\n\n1:17:22.700 --> 1:17:23.700\n Gotcha.\n\n1:17:23.700 --> 1:17:26.980\n So they kind of interrupt the mission to say, check it out.\n\n1:17:26.980 --> 1:17:27.980\n That's exactly it.\n\n1:17:27.980 --> 1:17:34.020\n So we start driving out there and as we get down to, he's going, you know, 20 miles, 15\n\n1:17:34.020 --> 1:17:35.020\n miles, 10 miles.\n\n1:17:35.020 --> 1:17:38.620\n And then you get to a point where they call merge plot, which means we are inside of the\n\n1:17:38.620 --> 1:17:42.920\n resolution cell of the radar because radars don't see everything there.\n\n1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:46.260\n So they have a range and they have an azimuth resolution, right?\n\n1:17:46.260 --> 1:17:50.140\n So and it's basically think of a little cube so they can, and the whole sky is made of\n\n1:17:50.140 --> 1:17:52.440\n all these little cubes and they're looking.\n\n1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:56.320\n So if you're inside a cube with something and you're both inside the same little cube,\n\n1:17:56.320 --> 1:17:57.780\n then the radar can only see one thing.\n\n1:17:57.780 --> 1:17:58.780\n Does that make sense?\n\n1:17:58.780 --> 1:17:59.780\n Yep.\n\n1:17:59.780 --> 1:18:00.780\n Yep.\n\n1:18:00.780 --> 1:18:01.780\n So they call merge plot.\n\n1:18:01.780 --> 1:18:05.340\n Well, when we say merge plot to us, it means he's right around, something's around you,\n\n1:18:05.340 --> 1:18:06.340\n get your head out.\n\n1:18:06.340 --> 1:18:09.700\n So we're not looking at radar scopes anymore and the wizos, the wizos can look, but everyone\n\n1:18:09.700 --> 1:18:10.700\n it's heads out.\n\n1:18:10.700 --> 1:18:13.740\n When they say merge plot, you're done looking at your displays inside.\n\n1:18:13.740 --> 1:18:15.940\n You're doing this and you're trying to find it.\n\n1:18:15.940 --> 1:18:20.380\n So as we look out to the right and you look high and low, because he could be anywhere\n\n1:18:20.380 --> 1:18:21.820\n from the surface all the way up.\n\n1:18:21.820 --> 1:18:26.180\n Now keep in mind the ship is like probably 60 miles away, so it can't see the surface\n\n1:18:26.180 --> 1:18:31.220\n and you can do your standard radar horizon calculation and go, hey, it's the thing is\n\n1:18:31.220 --> 1:18:35.780\n 40 feet off the water, the panel, can he really see, you know, there are radars that can see\n\n1:18:35.780 --> 1:18:40.340\n around the curve, but let's just say that it can't at this time.\n\n1:18:40.340 --> 1:18:42.820\n So you go, is it, you know, where is it at?\n\n1:18:42.820 --> 1:18:47.660\n So as we're looking around, we see, now this is a, it's a clear day.\n\n1:18:47.660 --> 1:18:51.420\n There's no clouds and there's no whitecaps.\n\n1:18:51.420 --> 1:18:54.460\n It's just a calm, it's actually a perfect day.\n\n1:18:54.460 --> 1:18:57.940\n If you own a sailboat, it was that five to 10 knots of wind and you just want to kind\n\n1:18:57.940 --> 1:19:01.180\n of go out there and you're not going to get beat up and have whitewater coming out.\n\n1:19:01.180 --> 1:19:03.020\n It was the perfect day to own a sailboat.\n\n1:19:03.020 --> 1:19:04.460\n How many miles out do you see?\n\n1:19:04.460 --> 1:19:07.380\n Like seven, like you see just, it's a clear day.\n\n1:19:07.380 --> 1:19:08.900\n It's 50, it's unrestricted visibility.\n\n1:19:08.900 --> 1:19:10.540\n You can see literally all the way to the horizon.\n\n1:19:10.540 --> 1:19:11.720\n It's just clear.\n\n1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:12.720\n It's nothing.\n\n1:19:12.720 --> 1:19:13.820\n And we're basically off the coast.\n\n1:19:13.820 --> 1:19:17.940\n If you look at a map and you go San Diego and then inside of Mexico, we're kind of in\n\n1:19:17.940 --> 1:19:18.940\n between that.\n\n1:19:18.940 --> 1:19:25.900\n And we're probably about, by the time this all hits, we're price, I don't know, 80, 100,\n\n1:19:25.900 --> 1:19:30.500\n I don't know, but somewhere out, it's pretty far off the coast, but from 20,000 feet, you'd\n\n1:19:30.500 --> 1:19:31.500\n be amazed.\n\n1:19:31.500 --> 1:19:32.500\n You can do the calculation.\n\n1:19:32.500 --> 1:19:35.700\n You can see stuff, you know, you'll see land 50 miles away, you know, you can see, you\n\n1:19:35.700 --> 1:19:39.460\n know, and when you're looking at a continent, it's really easy to see you're not looking\n\n1:19:39.460 --> 1:19:40.460\n at an island.\n\n1:19:40.460 --> 1:19:41.460\n I mean, you're looking at Mexico.\n\n1:19:41.460 --> 1:19:44.460\n And you can see on the whitecaps in the water, if there is any.\n\n1:19:44.460 --> 1:19:45.460\n Oh yeah, they're easy.\n\n1:19:45.460 --> 1:19:46.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:46.460 --> 1:19:50.860\n For us, we look at it because we know if it's natural wind or, so if it's a really whitecap\n\n1:19:50.860 --> 1:19:53.660\n windy day, then the ships just kind of barely be moving when we land on it.\n\n1:19:53.660 --> 1:19:55.540\n It makes it actually easier.\n\n1:19:55.540 --> 1:19:58.540\n If the ship has to move or it's got a big weight because it has to make its own wind\n\n1:19:58.540 --> 1:20:02.100\n when we land, which is the day that it was this day, you go, oh, okay.\n\n1:20:02.100 --> 1:20:05.420\n And it creates what's called, we call the burble, but when the air flows across the\n\n1:20:05.420 --> 1:20:09.740\n flight deck, it drops behind the ship, you know, and then it kicks back up.\n\n1:20:09.740 --> 1:20:12.420\n So when you're coming board to land, it's going to make you go up a little bit and then\n\n1:20:12.420 --> 1:20:15.740\n you're going to fall and you got to anticipate that to stay on glideslope.\n\n1:20:15.740 --> 1:20:21.840\n So we're pretty conscious of what's going on out there with the waves and the wind.\n\n1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:26.540\n So there's no waves, there's no wind, there's no whitecaps, and we look down and we see\n\n1:20:26.540 --> 1:20:28.420\n whitewater.\n\n1:20:28.420 --> 1:20:33.420\n So if you put a piece of land, a seamount below the surface, like, you know, even 20\n\n1:20:33.420 --> 1:20:35.220\n feet below the surface, it's big enough.\n\n1:20:35.220 --> 1:20:38.900\n As the waves come in, you know, waves have height and length.\n\n1:20:38.900 --> 1:20:42.140\n When they come in, that's what happens on the shore, when a wave comes in, it hits and\n\n1:20:42.140 --> 1:20:45.980\n then it starts to collapse and it pushes the wave height up because it can't go anymore\n\n1:20:45.980 --> 1:20:49.520\n and then it breaks over the top and that's where you get the weight.\n\n1:20:49.520 --> 1:20:53.220\n So what happens is at sea, when you get a seamount, you'll see stuff come in, the wave\n\n1:20:53.220 --> 1:20:55.180\n will crash and you'll get whitewater.\n\n1:20:55.180 --> 1:20:59.800\n You can go out when it's high tide in any one of the coasts, you can go out here off\n\n1:20:59.800 --> 1:21:03.420\n of Boston and go, hey, at low tide, I can see those rocks and at high tide, I can't\n\n1:21:03.420 --> 1:21:05.660\n see the rocks are covered, but there'll be whitewater around those rocks.\n\n1:21:05.660 --> 1:21:07.500\n You'll be able to tell there's something underneath the surface.\n\n1:21:07.500 --> 1:21:08.500\n Does that make sense?\n\n1:21:08.500 --> 1:21:09.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:21:09.500 --> 1:21:10.500\n So that's what it was.\n\n1:21:10.500 --> 1:21:14.500\n We don't see an object because there's all kinds of, oh, they saw another craft below\n\n1:21:14.500 --> 1:21:15.500\n the wave.\n\n1:21:15.500 --> 1:21:16.740\n We didn't see anything below the water.\n\n1:21:16.740 --> 1:21:18.180\n We just saw whitewater.\n\n1:21:18.180 --> 1:21:21.100\n But the whitewater, and I like to shape it, you can say it was a cross.\n\n1:21:21.100 --> 1:21:23.020\n I say it's about the size of a 737.\n\n1:21:23.020 --> 1:21:27.860\n So it looks like if you took a 737, put it about 15, 20 feet below the water so the wave\n\n1:21:27.860 --> 1:21:30.820\n is breaking over the top and you're going to get whitewater where the plane is at, you'd\n\n1:21:30.820 --> 1:21:32.520\n see this kind of shape.\n\n1:21:32.520 --> 1:21:34.940\n So it looks like a cross.\n\n1:21:34.940 --> 1:21:39.420\n So as we're looking down off the right side, the backseater in the other airplane, Jim,\n\n1:21:39.420 --> 1:21:41.500\n says this is that talking in partials again.\n\n1:21:41.500 --> 1:21:43.180\n He says, hey, Skipper, do you?\n\n1:21:43.180 --> 1:21:44.700\n And that's about what he gets out of his mouth.\n\n1:21:44.700 --> 1:21:47.100\n And I go, what the hell is that?\n\n1:21:47.100 --> 1:21:48.100\n In a nice way.\n\n1:21:48.100 --> 1:21:49.100\n Do you see that essentially is what he's saying?\n\n1:21:49.100 --> 1:21:51.700\n So we see the whitewater and that's what draws our eyes down there.\n\n1:21:51.700 --> 1:21:53.140\n Otherwise we'd have never seen it.\n\n1:21:53.140 --> 1:21:54.140\n So we see this whitewater.\n\n1:21:54.140 --> 1:21:56.460\n I would have loved to see the look on your face when you see that.\n\n1:21:56.460 --> 1:22:01.020\n And then we see this little white tic tac because we're about 20,000 feet above it and\n\n1:22:01.020 --> 1:22:05.740\n it's doing, it's going basically north, south, and then east, west, north, and it's abrupt.\n\n1:22:05.740 --> 1:22:06.740\n It's very abrupt.\n\n1:22:06.740 --> 1:22:11.740\n So it's not like a helicopter, if a helicopter is going sideways and it goes once, it's going\n\n1:22:11.740 --> 1:22:15.220\n sideways left and it goes right, what it'll do is it'll go, it's got a speed, it slows\n\n1:22:15.220 --> 1:22:18.760\n down because there's inertia and it stops and then it goes back the other way.\n\n1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:22.100\n This thing's not, it's like left, right, left, right with no.\n\n1:22:22.100 --> 1:22:28.100\n So moving in ways that doesn't feel intuitive to you of the things you've seen in the past.\n\n1:22:28.100 --> 1:22:31.980\n So as a pilot, the first thing you think is it's a helicopter, right?\n\n1:22:31.980 --> 1:22:36.800\n So you go, oh, what is, cause when we see it's moving, we're like, oh, helicopter.\n\n1:22:36.800 --> 1:22:39.780\n So the first thing you look for to see if it's a helicopter when they're doing that,\n\n1:22:39.780 --> 1:22:43.820\n because usually when they get down there towards that 50 feet, you'll get rotor wash.\n\n1:22:43.820 --> 1:22:47.020\n You see it in the movies when the helicopter's by the water, it kicks, the water comes up\n\n1:22:47.020 --> 1:22:50.380\n the sides cause the downdraft, you know, like a thunderstorm will do that.\n\n1:22:50.380 --> 1:22:53.380\n It pushes the air down and then it has to come up the sides.\n\n1:22:53.380 --> 1:22:56.700\n So you see it and you go, well, there's no, there's no rotor wash.\n\n1:22:56.700 --> 1:22:58.420\n What is that thing?\n\n1:22:58.420 --> 1:22:59.820\n So by this time we're driving around.\n\n1:22:59.820 --> 1:23:02.700\n So as we're, if we were at the six oclock, we're driving around towards that nine oclock\n\n1:23:02.700 --> 1:23:04.340\n position and we're just watching this thing.\n\n1:23:04.340 --> 1:23:07.460\n And it's just, it's still pointing north, south, and it's going left, right, and it's\n\n1:23:07.460 --> 1:23:09.460\n kind of moving around the object.\n\n1:23:09.460 --> 1:23:13.360\n And if it had, if I had to say it biased itself, it was biased towards the bottom half.\n\n1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:17.260\n So if you've got the east, west, and then the north, south kind of across, it's hanging\n\n1:23:17.260 --> 1:23:18.820\n out on the southern thing that's hanging out.\n\n1:23:18.820 --> 1:23:21.380\n It's just kind of moving around up, down, left, and it's crossing over it and it's going\n\n1:23:21.380 --> 1:23:22.380\n up.\n\n1:23:22.380 --> 1:23:25.420\n It's just kind of, so now we're like, what the hell is that?\n\n1:23:25.420 --> 1:23:28.900\n So then I go, hey, I'm going to go check it out.\n\n1:23:28.900 --> 1:23:31.260\n And the other pilot says, I'm going to stay up here.\n\n1:23:31.260 --> 1:23:32.860\n And I said, yeah, stay up high.\n\n1:23:32.860 --> 1:23:35.360\n Because now we get, we get a different perspective.\n\n1:23:35.360 --> 1:23:38.880\n So she's up here and I'm down here as I'm descending.\n\n1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:43.060\n She can watch, because right now all I'm watching is the Tic Tac.\n\n1:23:43.060 --> 1:23:44.660\n She can watch me and the Tic Tac.\n\n1:23:44.660 --> 1:23:47.740\n So she gets a God's eye view of everything that's going on, which is really important.\n\n1:23:47.740 --> 1:23:50.540\n You know, you can hear people say it's high cover, whatever.\n\n1:23:50.540 --> 1:23:55.620\n She's watching me, which is, it's perfect as the story goes on, because it gives us\n\n1:23:55.620 --> 1:24:00.300\n two perspectives, you know, of a perspective that's about 8,000 feet above us when that\n\n1:24:00.300 --> 1:24:01.300\n thing disappears.\n\n1:24:01.300 --> 1:24:04.340\n And they don't, you know, because if it's just like, oh, I lost it and they go, no,\n\n1:24:04.340 --> 1:24:05.340\n it's over to the right.\n\n1:24:05.340 --> 1:24:06.340\n We can still see it.\n\n1:24:06.340 --> 1:24:07.860\n We all lost it at the same time.\n\n1:24:07.860 --> 1:24:11.060\n So as we come down, we get to about 12 oclock and I'm descending and it's an easy descent.\n\n1:24:11.060 --> 1:24:15.500\n I'm doing about 300 knots, which is a really good airspeed for the airplane for maneuvering\n\n1:24:15.500 --> 1:24:19.740\n because I have, I have everything available to me at that speed.\n\n1:24:19.740 --> 1:24:23.620\n So I'm coming down and as I get to 12 oclock, as the Tic Tac's doing this, it literally,\n\n1:24:23.620 --> 1:24:27.900\n it's like, it's aware of us and it just goes bloop and it kind of points out towards the\n\n1:24:27.900 --> 1:24:29.680\n West and starts coming up.\n\n1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:31.700\n So now it's obviously knows that we're there.\n\n1:24:31.700 --> 1:24:33.940\n Whatever this thing is, it knows that we're there.\n\n1:24:33.940 --> 1:24:36.260\n So as we drive around, it's coming up and I'm just coming down.\n\n1:24:36.260 --> 1:24:37.260\n We're just, I'm just watching it.\n\n1:24:37.260 --> 1:24:39.760\n Now, you gotta remember this whole thing is like, this is like five minutes.\n\n1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:43.460\n This is not like we saw it and it was gone or, oh, I saw lights in the sky and they were\n\n1:24:43.460 --> 1:24:44.460\n gone.\n\n1:24:44.460 --> 1:24:50.100\n We watched this thing on a crystal clear day with four trained observers, watch this thing\n\n1:24:50.100 --> 1:24:51.100\n fly around.\n\n1:24:51.100 --> 1:24:52.140\n So we're like, okay.\n\n1:24:52.140 --> 1:24:55.600\n So I get over to the eight oclock position and I'm a little, I'm a couple thousand feet\n\n1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:59.060\n above it and it's about, so I'm probably at about 15 K I think it is.\n\n1:24:59.060 --> 1:25:00.460\n I think that's my story is about 15.\n\n1:25:00.460 --> 1:25:01.460\n It's just estimating.\n\n1:25:01.460 --> 1:25:05.180\n So you can see it's just a really easy descent because.\n\n1:25:05.180 --> 1:25:06.180\n So what's 15 K?\n\n1:25:06.180 --> 1:25:07.180\n 15,000 feet.\n\n1:25:07.180 --> 1:25:08.180\n I thought it was 8,000.\n\n1:25:08.180 --> 1:25:12.700\n No, the other plane ends up about that.\n\n1:25:12.700 --> 1:25:14.500\n So they're still at about 20,000 feet.\n\n1:25:14.500 --> 1:25:16.780\n So they're driving around and I'm descending.\n\n1:25:16.780 --> 1:25:17.780\n They're staying up there.\n\n1:25:17.780 --> 1:25:20.460\n So I'm kind of doing this as they drive around.\n\n1:25:20.460 --> 1:25:21.460\n Okay.\n\n1:25:21.460 --> 1:25:23.700\n So I'm looking at this thing and it's about the two oclock position.\n\n1:25:23.700 --> 1:25:27.140\n We're about the eight oclock position and I'm like, oh, I've got, I've got enough altitudes.\n\n1:25:27.140 --> 1:25:28.700\n I'm going to, I'm going to cut across the circle.\n\n1:25:28.700 --> 1:25:31.700\n I tell the guy in my back seat, dude, I'm going to, I'm going to do this.\n\n1:25:31.700 --> 1:25:32.700\n He's like, go for it.\n\n1:25:32.700 --> 1:25:33.700\n Skip.\n\n1:25:33.700 --> 1:25:34.740\n Cause I was a skipper.\n\n1:25:34.740 --> 1:25:37.240\n So I cut across the bottom.\n\n1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:40.780\n So I'm kind of almost coming out coaltitude as this thing's coming up, I'm going to meet\n\n1:25:40.780 --> 1:25:41.780\n it.\n\n1:25:41.780 --> 1:25:46.260\n And I'm driving and I get to probably it's, I'm probably about a half mile away, which\n\n1:25:46.260 --> 1:25:47.700\n you think, well, a half mile is pretty far.\n\n1:25:47.700 --> 1:25:50.020\n Half mile in aviation isn't, it's nothing.\n\n1:25:50.020 --> 1:25:52.580\n It's I mean, you can tell there's a pilot in an airplane.\n\n1:25:52.580 --> 1:25:54.500\n You can see all kinds of stuff at a half mile.\n\n1:25:54.500 --> 1:25:56.320\n You can see pretty good detail.\n\n1:25:56.320 --> 1:25:58.600\n So I'm like right there and it's coming across my nose.\n\n1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:00.300\n So now I'm basically pointing back towards east.\n\n1:26:00.300 --> 1:26:02.980\n So I'm cutting across cause I'm going to the three oclock position.\n\n1:26:02.980 --> 1:26:05.760\n It's at two oclock and I'm going to meet it at three oclock.\n\n1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:08.880\n So as I do this, it goes, it just accelerates and disappears.\n\n1:26:08.880 --> 1:26:11.900\n So this happens at around, estimating about 12,000 feet.\n\n1:26:11.900 --> 1:26:12.900\n So they're at 20.\n\n1:26:12.900 --> 1:26:16.220\n So they've got about 8,000 foot of altitude above us when this happens.\n\n1:26:16.220 --> 1:26:21.060\n And it just, as it crosses our nose, it just, it accelerates and literally in less than,\n\n1:26:21.060 --> 1:26:24.560\n you know, probably less than a half second, it just goes and it's gone.\n\n1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:28.700\n And so we're like, and I had the first thing is, dude, did you guys see it?\n\n1:26:28.700 --> 1:26:30.740\n The other airplane's like, it's gone.\n\n1:26:30.740 --> 1:26:32.740\n We don't, we have no idea where it's at.\n\n1:26:32.740 --> 1:26:34.020\n So we kind of spin around real quick.\n\n1:26:34.020 --> 1:26:35.460\n I go, well, let's see what's down here.\n\n1:26:35.460 --> 1:26:38.620\n And I turn around and we're looking for the whitewater and we can't even, the whitewater's\n\n1:26:38.620 --> 1:26:39.620\n gone.\n\n1:26:39.620 --> 1:26:40.620\n There's nothing.\n\n1:26:40.620 --> 1:26:41.620\n It's literally all blue.\n\n1:26:41.620 --> 1:26:42.620\n So now you go.\n\n1:26:42.620 --> 1:26:46.860\n And I remember telling the guy in my backseat, like a dude, I'm, I don't know about you,\n\n1:26:46.860 --> 1:26:51.740\n but I'm pretty weirded out because this is, I mean, you know, I had at the time like 30\n\n1:26:51.740 --> 1:26:52.740\n some hundred hours of flying.\n\n1:26:52.740 --> 1:26:53.740\n I'd been doing it for 18 years.\n\n1:26:53.740 --> 1:26:55.740\n It's nothing like anything you've seen.\n\n1:26:55.740 --> 1:26:56.740\n No, no.\n\n1:26:56.740 --> 1:27:00.900\n So as we turn, we go, well, let's just go back, you know, because now I got to put on\n\n1:27:00.900 --> 1:27:06.340\n my real hat, which we have to train because we're getting ready to deploy to overseas.\n\n1:27:06.340 --> 1:27:07.440\n So we got to get our training done.\n\n1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:10.700\n So that's my mindset, especially as a CEO, cause I got to get, I got to get training\n\n1:27:10.700 --> 1:27:13.100\n out of the flight time because I'm responsible to do that.\n\n1:27:13.100 --> 1:27:14.540\n So, Hey, let's go back.\n\n1:27:14.540 --> 1:27:19.100\n And the, the, the guy who's going to be the bad guys is the CEO of the Marine squadron.\n\n1:27:19.100 --> 1:27:22.580\n And so Cheeks is at the, he's listening to all this happen, you know, cause he's just\n\n1:27:22.580 --> 1:27:25.780\n like, cause he, they, when he first went out, they were going to do him, but the little\n\n1:27:25.780 --> 1:27:30.960\n Hornets, the legacy Hornets, the F18Cs don't have as much gas as the Super Hornets.\n\n1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:33.260\n So he had launched first and they were going to do him.\n\n1:27:33.260 --> 1:27:36.140\n And then when they knew we were off the deck, they just told him, hey, go to your cap point\n\n1:27:36.140 --> 1:27:42.100\n down South, and we're going to send, we'll pass this off to the Super Hornets.\n\n1:27:42.100 --> 1:27:43.460\n What's a cap point by the way?\n\n1:27:43.460 --> 1:27:44.460\n That's where we hold.\n\n1:27:44.460 --> 1:27:46.700\n So it's called a combat air patrol point.\n\n1:27:46.700 --> 1:27:48.180\n So we're just going to hold at one end.\n\n1:27:48.180 --> 1:27:49.900\n He's going to hold at the other end.\n\n1:27:49.900 --> 1:27:53.500\n It's kind of like, Hey, you guys are going to get, it's, it's, if it's a football field,\n\n1:27:53.500 --> 1:27:54.720\n we're going to sit on one goal line.\n\n1:27:54.720 --> 1:27:55.900\n He's going to sit on the other goal line.\n\n1:27:55.900 --> 1:27:58.660\n And when they say go, we're going to run at each other and then try and do something in\n\n1:27:58.660 --> 1:28:01.020\n the middle of the field and then go back to our set reset points.\n\n1:28:01.020 --> 1:28:02.020\n Okay.\n\n1:28:02.020 --> 1:28:03.020\n So you're talking to him.\n\n1:28:03.020 --> 1:28:05.520\n He's, he's, he's listening to the, he's just listening.\n\n1:28:05.520 --> 1:28:06.520\n We don't talk to him at all.\n\n1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:07.520\n He's just listening.\n\n1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:08.520\n He just dials up.\n\n1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:09.520\n Cause they know that we all know the frequencies.\n\n1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:12.860\n So he's listening to what's going on because he's like, cause they canceled training.\n\n1:28:12.860 --> 1:28:13.860\n So what else is he going to do?\n\n1:28:13.860 --> 1:28:16.700\n He's just going to hang out there and do circles while he's waiting for him and his wingman.\n\n1:28:16.700 --> 1:28:18.820\n So they just, they're listening to all this go on.\n\n1:28:18.820 --> 1:28:20.340\n And then at this point you move on.\n\n1:28:20.340 --> 1:28:21.340\n Yeah.\n\n1:28:21.340 --> 1:28:22.340\n We come back up to train.\n\n1:28:22.340 --> 1:28:24.220\n We go back as we're flying back the controller.\n\n1:28:24.220 --> 1:28:28.780\n Cause we're talking to the kid on the Princeton, the, the, uh, the, uh, they're called OSs\n\n1:28:28.780 --> 1:28:29.780\n or operations specialists.\n\n1:28:29.780 --> 1:28:34.220\n They're the ones that run the radars and we're talking to him and he's like, Hey, sir, you're\n\n1:28:34.220 --> 1:28:35.220\n not going to believe this.\n\n1:28:35.220 --> 1:28:37.060\n He's like, that thing is at your cap.\n\n1:28:37.060 --> 1:28:38.060\n It showed back up.\n\n1:28:38.060 --> 1:28:39.060\n It just popped up.\n\n1:28:39.060 --> 1:28:40.060\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:28:40.060 --> 1:28:41.060\n This is like 60 miles away.\n\n1:28:41.060 --> 1:28:42.060\n It just reappears.\n\n1:28:42.060 --> 1:28:43.060\n We're like, Oh, okay.\n\n1:28:43.060 --> 1:28:44.060\n So we got the radars out.\n\n1:28:44.060 --> 1:28:45.060\n We're looking for it.\n\n1:28:45.060 --> 1:28:46.060\n Uh, we get out there.\n\n1:28:46.060 --> 1:28:47.060\n We never see it.\n\n1:28:47.060 --> 1:28:48.060\n We never see it again.\n\n1:28:48.060 --> 1:28:49.240\n Uh, we do what we need to do.\n\n1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:50.240\n We come back to the ship.\n\n1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:53.020\n Of course, now we're like, Oh, this is going to be, we're going to, you know, I told him,\n\n1:28:53.020 --> 1:28:56.060\n I told him, I go, dude, you know, we're going to catch, we're going to catch shit for this.\n\n1:28:56.060 --> 1:28:59.500\n When we get back to the ship, word's going to get out and we're just going to catch maximum\n\n1:28:59.500 --> 1:29:00.500\n shit.\n\n1:29:00.500 --> 1:29:01.500\n And we did.\n\n1:29:01.500 --> 1:29:05.500\n We were joking, you know, so the ship plays movies, we have movies on the boat and they\n\n1:29:05.500 --> 1:29:06.660\n do 12 hours of movies.\n\n1:29:06.660 --> 1:29:08.540\n So they repeat cause there's a day check and a night check.\n\n1:29:08.540 --> 1:29:10.560\n So the same movies in the morning and night play.\n\n1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:14.860\n So you never get to ever get to watch a whole movie on the boat, which drives my wife crazy\n\n1:29:14.860 --> 1:29:16.580\n cause I'll watch stuff on TV that way too.\n\n1:29:16.580 --> 1:29:19.660\n I'll be like, Oh, Hey, I've seen this and it, I'll jump into a movie in the middle and\n\n1:29:19.660 --> 1:29:23.660\n then I'll pick it up later and I'll see the beginning and I'll put it all together, uh,\n\n1:29:23.660 --> 1:29:24.660\n because that's how we have to do it.\n\n1:29:24.660 --> 1:29:25.660\n Cause we're so busy.\n\n1:29:25.660 --> 1:29:34.020\n Well, the movies became, and I, it was men in black, aliens, uh, uh, independence day.\n\n1:29:34.020 --> 1:29:40.460\n Definitely going to catch some shit, but let, let, uh, let me just ask some dumb questions.\n\n1:29:40.460 --> 1:29:45.860\n So just take him, cause it's whatever, whatever the heck you saw, whatever the heck happened,\n\n1:29:45.860 --> 1:29:55.260\n it's, you know, one of the most fascinating things, um, events in recent history.\n\n1:29:55.260 --> 1:30:00.180\n So whatever it was, it's interesting to talk about it, different kinds of angles.\n\n1:30:00.180 --> 1:30:03.660\n There's no good answers, but it's interesting to ask some dumb questions here.\n\n1:30:03.660 --> 1:30:10.540\n Uh, so first of all, you mentioned, see, you saw at some point X, Y, and then, uh, somebody\n\n1:30:10.540 --> 1:30:13.780\n in the Princeton said, you're not going to believe this, sir.\n\n1:30:13.780 --> 1:30:16.320\n It's at your cap point that that's a different place.\n\n1:30:16.320 --> 1:30:18.340\n How the heck did it know what your cap point is?\n\n1:30:18.340 --> 1:30:19.340\n That's a good question.\n\n1:30:19.340 --> 1:30:23.980\n And that's the one of you to no one, you know, you don't, we don't tell it, we don't broadcast\n\n1:30:23.980 --> 1:30:27.300\n it, we have a waypoint in the system, but I don't know.\n\n1:30:27.300 --> 1:30:28.300\n Maybe it knew where we were going.\n\n1:30:28.300 --> 1:30:33.140\n Cause we use the same one day after day after day, but it, it obviously knew, but you never\n\n1:30:33.140 --> 1:30:34.380\n saw it there.\n\n1:30:34.380 --> 1:30:35.380\n Never saw it there.\n\n1:30:35.380 --> 1:30:39.480\n Chad, when he took off, when he got the video, we landed, we told them, Hey, look, we just,\n\n1:30:39.480 --> 1:30:40.480\n we just chased this thing.\n\n1:30:40.480 --> 1:30:41.480\n They're like, what?\n\n1:30:41.480 --> 1:30:42.480\n I got to chase it.\n\n1:30:42.480 --> 1:30:46.740\n And they're like, well, I go, dude, and I go, and I told him, I said, dude, get video.\n\n1:30:46.740 --> 1:30:48.500\n And he goes, and so, and that's how he is.\n\n1:30:48.500 --> 1:30:49.500\n He's like, I'm going to go.\n\n1:30:49.500 --> 1:30:52.420\n And he, he was, he, he was determined that he was going to find this thing.\n\n1:30:52.420 --> 1:30:56.940\n So when you look at his video, and this is the stuff that isn't out, that they don't\n\n1:30:56.940 --> 1:30:59.740\n see because not all the, all you see is the FLIR tape.\n\n1:30:59.740 --> 1:31:02.580\n That's the targeting pod, the forward looking infrared receiver.\n\n1:31:02.580 --> 1:31:05.980\n I'll probably overlay the video for people to see.\n\n1:31:05.980 --> 1:31:10.580\n When he goes out, it's you know, what he's looking at on his displays is he has basically\n\n1:31:10.580 --> 1:31:12.460\n two radar displays up.\n\n1:31:12.460 --> 1:31:16.620\n He has azimuth and range on the right one, and he has azimuth and elevation on the left\n\n1:31:16.620 --> 1:31:17.620\n one.\n\n1:31:17.620 --> 1:31:18.620\n So this is called the Azel display.\n\n1:31:18.620 --> 1:31:22.780\n And this is called, this is basically the PPI, which is the, you're at the bottom of\n\n1:31:22.780 --> 1:31:23.780\n it.\n\n1:31:23.780 --> 1:31:24.780\n You're at the bottom of the square.\n\n1:31:24.780 --> 1:31:25.900\n It's really taken this.\n\n1:31:25.900 --> 1:31:30.100\n It's taken a cone because a radar really looks left and right from a point and it squares\n\n1:31:30.100 --> 1:31:31.100\n it out.\n\n1:31:31.100 --> 1:31:34.740\n So the entire bottom of the scope that we look at is us because they do this.\n\n1:31:34.740 --> 1:31:35.740\n They square it off.\n\n1:31:35.740 --> 1:31:39.560\n So, so he goes out and when he first sees it, he gets a radar return on it because when\n\n1:31:39.560 --> 1:31:40.700\n he's not trying to lock it.\n\n1:31:40.700 --> 1:31:44.560\n So the radar is just throwing energy out and getting it, you know, it's a Doppler radar.\n\n1:31:44.560 --> 1:31:46.100\n So when it's in search mode, that's all it's doing.\n\n1:31:46.100 --> 1:31:47.460\n It's going, oh, I can see you.\n\n1:31:47.460 --> 1:31:48.740\n And it's looking for return.\n\n1:31:48.740 --> 1:31:49.820\n So he gets a return.\n\n1:31:49.820 --> 1:31:52.780\n So he wants to see what it is because all you get is a little green square, unless it\n\n1:31:52.780 --> 1:31:55.860\n builds a track file on it, but a little green square is just sitting there.\n\n1:31:55.860 --> 1:32:00.140\n It's not moving because it's, it's sitting in one spot in space.\n\n1:32:00.140 --> 1:32:01.940\n He locks it up when he goes to lock it up.\n\n1:32:01.940 --> 1:32:05.320\n Now he's putting a bunch of energy on it, but he's telling the radar, stare down that\n\n1:32:05.320 --> 1:32:08.900\n line of sight and whatever's there, I want you to grab it and build a track file on it,\n\n1:32:08.900 --> 1:32:13.820\n which will tell us how high it is, how fast it is and the direction that it's going.\n\n1:32:13.820 --> 1:32:14.820\n Okay.\n\n1:32:14.820 --> 1:32:18.580\n So the radar is smart enough that when the signal comes back, if it's been messed with,\n\n1:32:18.580 --> 1:32:21.780\n it will tell you, it'll give you indications that I'm being jammed.\n\n1:32:21.780 --> 1:32:25.460\n So that's all it is, is you send a signal out, something, it manipulates the signal\n\n1:32:25.460 --> 1:32:29.360\n either in range and velocity or whatever, and it sends it back and the radar was smart\n\n1:32:29.360 --> 1:32:33.060\n enough to go, that is not a return that I'm expecting.\n\n1:32:33.060 --> 1:32:34.060\n Something's messing with me.\n\n1:32:34.060 --> 1:32:35.060\n I'm being jammed.\n\n1:32:35.060 --> 1:32:38.280\n And it shows you and it puts strobes up, it gives these lines on the radar and it does\n\n1:32:38.280 --> 1:32:39.280\n some stuff.\n\n1:32:39.280 --> 1:32:43.460\n So you can mean, well, it does, it goes full into, it's being jammed at about every mode\n\n1:32:43.460 --> 1:32:47.500\n you can possibly see because everything comes up and this aspect gets along, it's all kinds\n\n1:32:47.500 --> 1:32:50.800\n of, I don't want to get into details, but you can tell it's being jammed.\n\n1:32:50.800 --> 1:32:51.800\n So and it's what it does.\n\n1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:54.420\n As you said on Rogan, by the way, that jamming is an act of war, right?\n\n1:32:54.420 --> 1:32:57.980\n Active jamming is, when you actively jam another platform, yes, it's technically an act of\n\n1:32:57.980 --> 1:32:58.980\n war.\n\n1:32:58.980 --> 1:33:01.020\n It feels like you should be freaking out at this point, I mean.\n\n1:33:01.020 --> 1:33:05.860\n So well, he does it and then in the back seat, so they don't have a stick and throttle, they\n\n1:33:05.860 --> 1:33:09.620\n have their side stick controllers so they can control all the sensors and they can just\n\n1:33:09.620 --> 1:33:10.880\n toggle around and do stuff.\n\n1:33:10.880 --> 1:33:15.660\n So he has the ability to just move one switch real quick and it will go from that azimuth\n\n1:33:15.660 --> 1:33:17.780\n elevation on the radar to the targeting pod.\n\n1:33:17.780 --> 1:33:22.460\n Well, as soon as he commanded the radar to look at that target, the targeting pod goes,\n\n1:33:22.460 --> 1:33:23.460\n oh, what's over there?\n\n1:33:23.460 --> 1:33:25.860\n And it'll stare because it goes down the line of sight because all the systems are hooked\n\n1:33:25.860 --> 1:33:27.060\n together.\n\n1:33:27.060 --> 1:33:30.140\n You can decouple them, but they're going to automatically couple up.\n\n1:33:30.140 --> 1:33:34.200\n So when he castles over, it's a switch, it looks like a castle switch, what's a castle?\n\n1:33:34.200 --> 1:33:38.180\n So when he moves that thing to the left and he swaps the displays out and he says, instead\n\n1:33:38.180 --> 1:33:41.500\n of looking at the radar, I want to look at the targeting pod, he sees it on the targeting\n\n1:33:41.500 --> 1:33:44.020\n pod because the targeting pod's already looking there.\n\n1:33:44.020 --> 1:33:47.540\n And now he's on a passive track because he's not literally sending any energy out, he's\n\n1:33:47.540 --> 1:33:52.980\n just receiving IR energy from the tic tac and then the system itself will track the\n\n1:33:52.980 --> 1:33:56.180\n pixels and the contrast differences, it depends on what mode you're in.\n\n1:33:56.180 --> 1:33:58.780\n So it says, oh, and that's where those little bars you see in the video where the bars come\n\n1:33:58.780 --> 1:33:59.780\n up left and right.\n\n1:33:59.780 --> 1:34:02.120\n There's doing some vision based tracking.\n\n1:34:02.120 --> 1:34:03.860\n That's exactly what it is.\n\n1:34:03.860 --> 1:34:06.300\n So and then he goes through.\n\n1:34:06.300 --> 1:34:08.580\n Changes zooms, changes the mode.\n\n1:34:08.580 --> 1:34:11.460\n He goes through all the modes, so there's a narrow, medium and wide.\n\n1:34:11.460 --> 1:34:14.420\n So wide is far away, medium and then narrow.\n\n1:34:14.420 --> 1:34:18.500\n And then there's the TV mode and he goes from IR mode to the TV mode.\n\n1:34:18.500 --> 1:34:25.860\n The cool thing with the TV mode is narrow IR mode is only medium TV mode.\n\n1:34:25.860 --> 1:34:28.300\n So you can actually get closer with narrow TV mode.\n\n1:34:28.300 --> 1:34:32.180\n It's got a better zoom capability when you go into TV mode.\n\n1:34:32.180 --> 1:34:35.020\n So he goes through all those things and that's when you see it going from a black background\n\n1:34:35.020 --> 1:34:36.020\n to a white background.\n\n1:34:36.020 --> 1:34:37.260\n So you can figure out what the heck is this?\n\n1:34:37.260 --> 1:34:40.740\n Well, yeah, and he wants to get as much data as he can on it based on the different modes\n\n1:34:40.740 --> 1:34:45.300\n instead of just staring at it going, what is that thing?\n\n1:34:45.300 --> 1:34:50.140\n So the video has been out, it actually was on YouTube for years before the government\n\n1:34:50.140 --> 1:34:51.140\n released it.\n\n1:34:51.140 --> 1:34:54.460\n It was leaked in 2007?\n\n1:34:54.460 --> 1:35:00.560\n No, the guy that was in my backseat sent me an email and I had retired.\n\n1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:05.020\n So this is about, nope, because I was working down in San Diego.\n\n1:35:05.020 --> 1:35:15.300\n So this is about 2008, early 2009, he sends me a link to strangeland.com, which is not\n\n1:35:15.300 --> 1:35:16.300\n suitable for work.\n\n1:35:16.300 --> 1:35:18.260\n Oh yeah, it's top notch.\n\n1:35:18.260 --> 1:35:24.300\n And he says, I can remember the email, hey Skip, does this look familiar?\n\n1:35:24.300 --> 1:35:29.940\n And I look at it, I'm like, how the hell did that get on strangeland.com?\n\n1:35:29.940 --> 1:35:35.300\n So next thing you know, it ends up on YouTube, which was cool because you can send a YouTube\n\n1:35:35.300 --> 1:35:36.620\n link to someone.\n\n1:35:36.620 --> 1:35:40.620\n You don't send strangeland.com to someone because you don't know what you're going to\n\n1:35:40.620 --> 1:35:41.620\n get.\n\n1:35:41.620 --> 1:35:42.620\n It's like Googling kittens.\n\n1:35:42.620 --> 1:35:47.140\n So it ends up there somehow.\n\n1:35:47.140 --> 1:35:50.940\n So it gets on YouTube, which was cool because I would go out with my friends and we'd be\n\n1:35:50.940 --> 1:35:53.780\n drinking and they go, dude, what's the coolest thing you ever saw flying?\n\n1:35:53.780 --> 1:35:55.420\n It's kind of like you were asking what it's like.\n\n1:35:55.420 --> 1:35:58.140\n And I go, oh dude, I chased a UFO and they're like, get out.\n\n1:35:58.140 --> 1:35:59.140\n And I'm like, no, serious.\n\n1:35:59.140 --> 1:36:01.100\n This is literally how it happened.\n\n1:36:01.100 --> 1:36:03.040\n So I was sitting with my friend Matt.\n\n1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:07.420\n So Matt and I did our, he was the guy in my right seat of the A6 when I did my very first\n\n1:36:07.420 --> 1:36:08.800\n night trap.\n\n1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:11.060\n And we were friends to this day.\n\n1:36:11.060 --> 1:36:15.660\n Because when you do stuff like people like that, I had to have faith in him, he had to\n\n1:36:15.660 --> 1:36:20.980\n have faith in me, they become like your brother.\n\n1:36:20.980 --> 1:36:24.860\n And these are guys that literally, I don't talk to them on a regular basis, like Chris\n\n1:36:24.860 --> 1:36:26.600\n who works at Apple.\n\n1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:29.580\n If Chris called me up tomorrow and said, dude, I need help.\n\n1:36:29.580 --> 1:36:30.580\n I need this.\n\n1:36:30.580 --> 1:36:32.540\n I'd be like, all right, let's figure this out and let's do it.\n\n1:36:32.540 --> 1:36:34.660\n Because it's, they're like family, you do it.\n\n1:36:34.660 --> 1:36:38.940\n And most Navy guys, we don't send letters to each other weekly.\n\n1:36:38.940 --> 1:36:43.180\n You know, I have friends that I haven't talked to in 10 years that they showed up on my door,\n\n1:36:43.180 --> 1:36:47.220\n you know, pop a bottle of wine, grab a beer, shoot the shit, take about first 10 minutes\n\n1:36:47.220 --> 1:36:48.220\n to catch up.\n\n1:36:48.220 --> 1:36:51.820\n And then it's like old times and it's amazing how fast it's happened.\n\n1:36:51.820 --> 1:36:57.780\n So I'm out to dinner with Matt and I'm telling him this story and he's like, get out of here.\n\n1:36:57.780 --> 1:37:05.480\n So he goes back and he tells our friend Paco, Paco has fightersweep.com, it's a blog site.\n\n1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:09.700\n So Paco's obsessed, like he is way into UFOs.\n\n1:37:09.700 --> 1:37:12.700\n So Paco calls me up, he says, dude, I was talking to Matty.\n\n1:37:12.700 --> 1:37:13.700\n That's what we call him.\n\n1:37:13.700 --> 1:37:14.700\n He goes, I was talking to Matty.\n\n1:37:14.700 --> 1:37:18.460\n He goes, dude, you got to tell me this story.\n\n1:37:18.460 --> 1:37:19.460\n So I'm like, all right.\n\n1:37:19.460 --> 1:37:24.020\n I'm going to spend a chunk of time and so he calls me one day and I'm like, I got to\n\n1:37:24.020 --> 1:37:25.020\n get a voicemail.\n\n1:37:25.020 --> 1:37:26.020\n Hey, give me a call.\n\n1:37:26.020 --> 1:37:29.540\n So I call him up and he answers the phone, but I could hear people in the background\n\n1:37:29.540 --> 1:37:30.540\n and I go, hey dude, what's going on?\n\n1:37:30.540 --> 1:37:31.540\n He goes, hang on, hang on.\n\n1:37:31.540 --> 1:37:32.540\n I got to put you on speakerphone.\n\n1:37:32.540 --> 1:37:33.540\n I go, what are you putting me on speakerphone?\n\n1:37:33.540 --> 1:37:34.540\n He goes, you got to tell the story.\n\n1:37:34.540 --> 1:37:36.420\n I'm having a dinner party.\n\n1:37:36.420 --> 1:37:37.420\n You got to tell the story.\n\n1:37:37.420 --> 1:37:40.100\n So he's literally having a dinner party with his cell phone in the middle of the table\n\n1:37:40.100 --> 1:37:42.440\n as I tell a Tic Tac story.\n\n1:37:42.440 --> 1:37:43.440\n So he calls me up again.\n\n1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:48.260\n He says, hey, I got this blog and he just writes about fighter stuff.\n\n1:37:48.260 --> 1:37:50.500\n Like he wrote about that we call them the shit hot break.\n\n1:37:50.500 --> 1:37:53.940\n That's a guy that when you're laying on a carrier, comes in, turns and gets ready to\n\n1:37:53.940 --> 1:37:54.940\n land really fast.\n\n1:37:54.940 --> 1:37:59.840\n Like breaks it off right at the back of the ship and one of the guys, when we were junior\n\n1:37:59.840 --> 1:38:04.220\n officers on the USS Ranger, one of the department heads in the other squadron is a guy, Nasty.\n\n1:38:04.220 --> 1:38:08.780\n And Nasty was notorious for coming in in a Tomcat and cranking off the shit hot break.\n\n1:38:08.780 --> 1:38:13.700\n So he literally wrote a thing about the shit hot break with Nasty and there's another guy,\n\n1:38:13.700 --> 1:38:20.380\n Mav, was one of our landing signals officers for the air wing.\n\n1:38:20.380 --> 1:38:24.980\n It's a good article on how this was and how it kind of forms you in Naval Aviation, kind\n\n1:38:24.980 --> 1:38:26.420\n of being part of the club.\n\n1:38:26.420 --> 1:38:28.180\n So he's like, I got to write about this thing.\n\n1:38:28.180 --> 1:38:29.980\n I'm like, what do you guys, I got to write about it.\n\n1:38:29.980 --> 1:38:30.980\n I go, all right.\n\n1:38:30.980 --> 1:38:31.980\n Because at first I would say no.\n\n1:38:31.980 --> 1:38:32.980\n I'm like, dude, I don't want this out there.\n\n1:38:32.980 --> 1:38:33.980\n Just.\n\n1:38:33.980 --> 1:38:36.500\n So you haven't really before then talked about it much.\n\n1:38:36.500 --> 1:38:38.860\n My wife didn't even really know the whole story.\n\n1:38:38.860 --> 1:38:39.860\n Why?\n\n1:38:39.860 --> 1:38:42.700\n Just as a comment, is it just because you caught some.\n\n1:38:42.700 --> 1:38:47.300\n You know, it was just, I'll tell you what, three days we had the incident for about two\n\n1:38:47.300 --> 1:38:48.300\n days.\n\n1:38:48.300 --> 1:38:49.300\n They played the goofy movies.\n\n1:38:49.300 --> 1:38:52.260\n There's a comic on the back of the air wing schedule that they would put.\n\n1:38:52.260 --> 1:38:56.460\n It was like first one was a far side and the second one was me and the guy in my back seat\n\n1:38:56.460 --> 1:38:59.820\n and it was men in black, but it had our names, you know, protecting protecting the Nimitz\n\n1:38:59.820 --> 1:39:00.820\n battle group type stuff.\n\n1:39:00.820 --> 1:39:03.820\n It's just funny shit like that.\n\n1:39:03.820 --> 1:39:06.180\n So to me it wasn't that big of a deal.\n\n1:39:06.180 --> 1:39:07.180\n It was like, okay, that's weird.\n\n1:39:07.180 --> 1:39:08.820\n We're never going to know what it was.\n\n1:39:08.820 --> 1:39:12.340\n I want to get out there because this is important because there's all kinds of rumors.\n\n1:39:12.340 --> 1:39:15.380\n There's a group of folks there.\n\n1:39:15.380 --> 1:39:20.460\n No one ever came out in suits to talk to us.\n\n1:39:20.460 --> 1:39:22.060\n Nobody looking like me.\n\n1:39:22.060 --> 1:39:26.140\n No came out on a, no, no one came out of the helicopter.\n\n1:39:26.140 --> 1:39:28.220\n No one came out on an airplane.\n\n1:39:28.220 --> 1:39:31.060\n You know, you get, oh, I was told to turn over this classified.\n\n1:39:31.060 --> 1:39:36.060\n What's funny is all the COs and several of them are still in the Navy.\n\n1:39:36.060 --> 1:39:38.660\n There's one that is a, he, I think he just finished up.\n\n1:39:38.660 --> 1:39:40.980\n He was a captain of an aircraft carrier.\n\n1:39:40.980 --> 1:39:44.180\n You know, so he'll end up making Admiral and all that stuff.\n\n1:39:44.180 --> 1:39:45.180\n Those guys are all my friends.\n\n1:39:45.180 --> 1:39:47.220\n I talk to them daily.\n\n1:39:47.220 --> 1:39:48.220\n Just to clarify.\n\n1:39:48.220 --> 1:39:56.100\n So just for people who don't know, there's a story that both on the Nimitz and the Princeton\n\n1:39:56.100 --> 1:39:59.140\n folks in a helicopter landed.\n\n1:39:59.140 --> 1:40:02.400\n They showed up, they took the data, quote unquote.\n\n1:40:02.400 --> 1:40:09.460\n So all the sort of recordings associated with this incident and they took it and presumably\n\n1:40:09.460 --> 1:40:10.460\n deleted it.\n\n1:40:10.460 --> 1:40:13.180\n So there's a kind of story to that.\n\n1:40:13.180 --> 1:40:19.060\n And then from what I've seen, you said that you believe, just like we were talking about\n\n1:40:19.060 --> 1:40:24.420\n offline, that jokes spread faster than, or just rumors spread faster than anything on\n\n1:40:24.420 --> 1:40:29.100\n these ships, that it might've been a joke that started and.\n\n1:40:29.100 --> 1:40:30.220\n Well, they did.\n\n1:40:30.220 --> 1:40:31.740\n So here's the joke.\n\n1:40:31.740 --> 1:40:33.120\n So they had come down, right?\n\n1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:37.100\n We had the tapes and they were Chad's tapes.\n\n1:40:37.100 --> 1:40:39.320\n So we use those tapes over and over again.\n\n1:40:39.320 --> 1:40:42.940\n They're consumable, but remember, I have a budget as a squadron, so I have a budget.\n\n1:40:42.940 --> 1:40:47.060\n So I have to buy those tapes, all that stuff that we use, I'm accountable for.\n\n1:40:47.060 --> 1:40:50.940\n And the tapes are actually classified secret because of the data that's on them.\n\n1:40:50.940 --> 1:40:52.460\n So we had the tapes.\n\n1:40:52.460 --> 1:40:59.100\n So the intelligence guys, the intel officers came down from what's called Civic, CVIC,\n\n1:40:59.100 --> 1:41:03.820\n which is Carrier Intel Center, came down and said, hey, we need the tapes.\n\n1:41:03.820 --> 1:41:07.060\n These guys are gonna come, they're gonna come and get them.\n\n1:41:07.060 --> 1:41:09.420\n So we're like, I'm like, oh, whatever.\n\n1:41:09.420 --> 1:41:15.340\n So we hand them the tapes and then someone, because I have, you know people, shortly after\n\n1:41:15.340 --> 1:41:18.820\n they came and got the tapes, someone came to me and said, you know, they're messing\n\n1:41:18.820 --> 1:41:20.820\n with you, they're playing a joke.\n\n1:41:20.820 --> 1:41:26.340\n So I said, oh, well, let's see how well that goes because I'm a CO and they're not.\n\n1:41:26.340 --> 1:41:31.020\n So I went down to Civic and it was a, I think he was a Lieutenant or Lieutenant JG, so he's\n\n1:41:31.020 --> 1:41:32.020\n way junior to me.\n\n1:41:32.020 --> 1:41:37.460\n And I said, hey, I want my tapes back and he looks at me and I go, I know you guys are\n\n1:41:37.460 --> 1:41:38.460\n pulling my leg.\n\n1:41:38.460 --> 1:41:40.100\n I know there's no one came out.\n\n1:41:40.100 --> 1:41:43.420\n And I go, and you have about 30 seconds to get me my tapes before I start tearing this\n\n1:41:43.420 --> 1:41:44.420\n place apart.\n\n1:41:44.420 --> 1:41:46.420\n That's literally what I told him.\n\n1:41:46.420 --> 1:41:50.780\n And I said, and if your boss has an issue, he can come and see me because it's not gonna\n\n1:41:50.780 --> 1:41:52.020\n go well.\n\n1:41:52.020 --> 1:41:54.540\n I said, because this is bullshit and I need those tapes.\n\n1:41:54.540 --> 1:41:57.940\n Then he literally walked right over to a filing cabinet, opened it up, they weren't in a safe.\n\n1:41:57.940 --> 1:42:00.700\n He opened up a filing cabinet and pulled them out and handed them to me.\n\n1:42:00.700 --> 1:42:05.220\n I said, and I basically said a few things to him, like, don't ever fuck with me again.\n\n1:42:05.220 --> 1:42:07.100\n And I left, I had the tapes.\n\n1:42:07.100 --> 1:42:08.540\n So this, no one came out.\n\n1:42:08.540 --> 1:42:11.380\n There's no flying going on when all this is happening.\n\n1:42:11.380 --> 1:42:15.260\n And I took the tapes back and then I copied the tapes.\n\n1:42:15.260 --> 1:42:19.640\n So I took two brand new eight mil tapes and I copied the sections that I want.\n\n1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:23.380\n So there's a rumor or two that, oh, the original FLIR video is 10 minutes long and there's\n\n1:42:23.380 --> 1:42:26.340\n some, one of these petty officers is saying, I saw it, that's total crap.\n\n1:42:26.340 --> 1:42:28.480\n The original video is about a minute, 30 seconds long.\n\n1:42:28.480 --> 1:42:31.740\n What you see on the release video is the entire video.\n\n1:42:31.740 --> 1:42:38.220\n So you have mentioned, I apologize if I say stupid things, please correct me, but you\n\n1:42:38.220 --> 1:42:45.620\n have mentioned that, like on Roguen, I think that you watched it on a bigger screen.\n\n1:42:45.620 --> 1:42:47.740\n It felt like it was higher definition.\n\n1:42:47.740 --> 1:42:55.220\n So let me ask the question, is there a higher definition version, do you think, of the FLIR\n\n1:42:55.220 --> 1:43:01.620\n video that would give us more pixels and more information presumably because of the high\n\n1:43:01.620 --> 1:43:02.620\n number of.\n\n1:43:02.620 --> 1:43:03.620\n I would doubt it.\n\n1:43:03.620 --> 1:43:05.980\n Because I don't know where, the stuff that the government released, I don't know where\n\n1:43:05.980 --> 1:43:06.980\n they got it.\n\n1:43:06.980 --> 1:43:07.980\n Okay.\n\n1:43:07.980 --> 1:43:11.140\n So the stuff that was on Strangeland and YouTube, someone pulled off of a secret, it looks like\n\n1:43:11.140 --> 1:43:12.140\n a rack.\n\n1:43:12.140 --> 1:43:15.300\n There's tape machines in there and it gets converted to digital and stored on a hard\n\n1:43:15.300 --> 1:43:19.100\n drive and they pulled it off that hard drive and they put it on YouTube.\n\n1:43:19.100 --> 1:43:24.700\n No, it's just like, anytime, even a digital media, the more you copy digital media, there's\n\n1:43:24.700 --> 1:43:27.060\n some quality that gets, it degrades.\n\n1:43:27.060 --> 1:43:29.000\n So this, you don't know how many times this has been copied.\n\n1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:32.580\n So we were looking, the videos I've seen are right off the original, they're Hi8 tapes,\n\n1:43:32.580 --> 1:43:35.860\n it's basically pulled off the back of the display, so it's not filmed with cameras,\n\n1:43:35.860 --> 1:43:39.560\n it's literally a digital feed that's pulled off the back and put onto a Hi8 tape.\n\n1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:40.800\n That's how the recorders work.\n\n1:43:40.800 --> 1:43:44.540\n Now it's actually digital to digital, it's not even on tapes anymore, it's a digital\n\n1:43:44.540 --> 1:43:47.580\n recording system, but we were still in that process of slowly, because originally we had\n\n1:43:47.580 --> 1:43:52.140\n little cameras here that shine, so if the light hit, it would wash out the displays.\n\n1:43:52.140 --> 1:43:57.460\n So it's a pretty good feed, when you put it on, so instead of looking at it on your tiny\n\n1:43:57.460 --> 1:44:02.260\n little computer monitor or whatever, I'm looking at it on like a 19 inch, because it was still\n\n1:44:02.260 --> 1:44:06.260\n normal TVs back there, we had just put flat screens in the ready room that I had bought,\n\n1:44:06.260 --> 1:44:07.420\n so we could watch movies.\n\n1:44:07.420 --> 1:44:11.220\n A nice, huge 19 inch screen.\n\n1:44:11.220 --> 1:44:13.820\n It's maybe 20, it was nice.\n\n1:44:13.820 --> 1:44:14.820\n Wow, that's huge.\n\n1:44:14.820 --> 1:44:15.820\n It was gigantic.\n\n1:44:15.820 --> 1:44:20.980\n I can get for like 50 bucks, you can get like 60 inches.\n\n1:44:20.980 --> 1:44:23.380\n This is 2005.\n\n1:44:23.380 --> 1:44:25.820\n So you look at it as this big thing.\n\n1:44:25.820 --> 1:44:28.940\n You could see, so when you get to the TV mode, when I say there's little things coming out\n\n1:44:28.940 --> 1:44:30.620\n of the bottom of it, you could see those.\n\n1:44:30.620 --> 1:44:32.320\n It was very clear.\n\n1:44:32.320 --> 1:44:38.620\n But in terms of the actual visual on the Tic Tac, did you get much more information from\n\n1:44:38.620 --> 1:44:40.700\n the higher, from the clear?\n\n1:44:40.700 --> 1:44:41.700\n Little things out of the bottom.\n\n1:44:41.700 --> 1:44:42.700\n We didn't see those visuals.\n\n1:44:42.700 --> 1:44:43.700\n So the bottom information.\n\n1:44:43.700 --> 1:44:44.700\n I got it.\n\n1:44:44.700 --> 1:44:47.060\n So when you see it, because he's coming almost coaltitude with it, you can see the bottom\n\n1:44:47.060 --> 1:44:48.060\n of it.\n\n1:44:48.060 --> 1:44:50.380\n It looks like little, you know, like if you look at a Cessna, there's little antennas\n\n1:44:50.380 --> 1:44:51.380\n hanging out of the bottom.\n\n1:44:51.380 --> 1:44:52.380\n Kind of like that.\n\n1:44:52.380 --> 1:44:53.800\n There was two little things out of the bottom.\n\n1:44:53.800 --> 1:44:54.800\n There's nothing on the top.\n\n1:44:54.800 --> 1:45:00.380\n There was no plume, no IR, no visible propulsions, even heat signature.\n\n1:45:00.380 --> 1:45:01.580\n You know, it's all that stuff.\n\n1:45:01.580 --> 1:45:06.260\n And then the other thing that people didn't see is they didn't see the radar display,\n\n1:45:06.260 --> 1:45:10.040\n which that really raises a classification of it, especially to see what the radar does\n\n1:45:10.040 --> 1:45:12.620\n when it's being jammed.\n\n1:45:12.620 --> 1:45:15.820\n You know, matter of fact, when they did the unofficial official investigation in about\n\n1:45:15.820 --> 1:45:21.060\n 2000 and let me think about 2009.\n\n1:45:21.060 --> 1:45:27.540\n I got a call on my cell phone from a guy who government employee and said, hey, he told\n\n1:45:27.540 --> 1:45:28.540\n me who he was.\n\n1:45:28.540 --> 1:45:30.140\n He's still in the government.\n\n1:45:30.140 --> 1:45:31.140\n I'm friends with him.\n\n1:45:31.140 --> 1:45:35.580\n And he said, hey, we're going to investigate your Tic Tac thing.\n\n1:45:35.580 --> 1:45:37.500\n This is literally five years later.\n\n1:45:37.500 --> 1:45:38.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:38.500 --> 1:45:39.620\n Five years later.\n\n1:45:39.620 --> 1:45:41.220\n And I said, OK, whatever.\n\n1:45:41.220 --> 1:45:42.220\n And he did a pretty good job.\n\n1:45:42.220 --> 1:45:48.500\n I caught the unofficial official report because it was really never official.\n\n1:45:48.500 --> 1:45:49.740\n It wasn't.\n\n1:45:49.740 --> 1:45:54.500\n But I'll give you the history of why I say that and why it never came out in FOIA requests.\n\n1:45:54.500 --> 1:45:55.540\n So he does the report.\n\n1:45:55.540 --> 1:45:56.740\n He sent me the report.\n\n1:45:56.740 --> 1:45:58.660\n And all he said is, hey, I'm going to send you this report.\n\n1:45:58.660 --> 1:46:01.220\n Please don't distribute this report.\n\n1:46:01.220 --> 1:46:02.620\n I said, OK.\n\n1:46:02.620 --> 1:46:06.800\n The report is now out because Harry Reid got it to George Knapp and they were good enough\n\n1:46:06.800 --> 1:46:07.800\n to redact it.\n\n1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:11.100\n But there's a few versions of it unredacted and I'm very protective of the other people\n\n1:46:11.100 --> 1:46:13.240\n that were involved in this.\n\n1:46:13.240 --> 1:46:15.500\n So Jim has talked, but he's off the grid.\n\n1:46:15.500 --> 1:46:17.380\n He doesn't talk to anyone now.\n\n1:46:17.380 --> 1:46:21.980\n The pilot of his airplane, she has come out on unidentified, but they don't release her\n\n1:46:21.980 --> 1:46:23.260\n name, although people are starting to do it.\n\n1:46:23.260 --> 1:46:25.140\n And she's had weird shit happen around her house.\n\n1:46:25.140 --> 1:46:29.340\n She's got kids, you know, so I'm very protective of her.\n\n1:46:29.340 --> 1:46:32.580\n And I've told people like Jeremy and George, if I know that the names ever came from you,\n\n1:46:32.580 --> 1:46:34.580\n I will never talk to you again about this.\n\n1:46:34.580 --> 1:46:36.000\n And Jeremy's been really good about it.\n\n1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:37.540\n And so is George.\n\n1:46:37.540 --> 1:46:43.900\n And then, but George knew who the names were because he got the report from Senator Reid.\n\n1:46:43.900 --> 1:46:44.900\n And then the other crew.\n\n1:46:44.900 --> 1:46:51.820\n So the pilot of the airplane that took the video that Chad was in, if you talk to that\n\n1:46:51.820 --> 1:46:53.820\n individual, they really don't have the recollection.\n\n1:46:53.820 --> 1:46:58.300\n They were just out flying that day and it wasn't a big deal.\n\n1:46:58.300 --> 1:47:01.780\n So it's you need to protect because not everyone wants people knocking.\n\n1:47:01.780 --> 1:47:05.600\n I don't want people knocking on my door and, you know, and there's rumors are you talk\n\n1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:06.600\n to everyone.\n\n1:47:06.600 --> 1:47:10.020\n You know, you're about the 23rd person that I've talked to total.\n\n1:47:10.020 --> 1:47:13.340\n And that includes, you know, the newspapers and stuff.\n\n1:47:13.340 --> 1:47:17.540\n And I've been selective because there's so much, I mean, if I turned down like, I turned\n\n1:47:17.540 --> 1:47:18.540\n down Russian TV.\n\n1:47:18.540 --> 1:47:21.660\n I can give you her name when we're done here.\n\n1:47:21.660 --> 1:47:24.940\n She called, she not only called me, she called my wife, she called my daughter, she called\n\n1:47:24.940 --> 1:47:28.380\n my son and she called my son in law because they're persistent.\n\n1:47:28.380 --> 1:47:30.380\n So I'm pretty protected.\n\n1:47:30.380 --> 1:47:31.380\n I'm very particular.\n\n1:47:31.380 --> 1:47:34.080\n I mean, the reason I'm talking to you is because I knew we would have a conversation that wasn't\n\n1:47:34.080 --> 1:47:37.780\n based just on the tic tac and the incident, but we can actually talk about some of the\n\n1:47:37.780 --> 1:47:42.740\n science and some of the theoretical to get into, to get more people involved to go.\n\n1:47:42.740 --> 1:47:48.020\n Cause I think there's, you know, and when you talk to, you know, Lou Elizondo or Chris\n\n1:47:48.020 --> 1:47:55.580\n Mellon, you know, the group at TTSA, you know, that whole thing, that's to the stars Academy.\n\n1:47:55.580 --> 1:47:57.260\n That's the Tom DeLonge group that got started.\n\n1:47:57.260 --> 1:48:02.860\n So you go, well, you know, cause I think Tom has caught a lot of crap for this, but he's\n\n1:48:02.860 --> 1:48:07.500\n actually, when you talk to him, he's, he's, he's very smart and I asked him, how'd you\n\n1:48:07.500 --> 1:48:08.500\n get into this?\n\n1:48:08.500 --> 1:48:12.260\n And he goes, oh, when I was traveling around with Blink 182, he goes, you read a lot of\n\n1:48:12.260 --> 1:48:16.480\n books when you're laying in a van as you're driving to your next gig before you make it\n\n1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:17.480\n big.\n\n1:48:17.480 --> 1:48:20.300\n And he goes, and he read, he was reading books and he read one of them on UFOs.\n\n1:48:20.300 --> 1:48:21.300\n I'm trying to think of the title.\n\n1:48:21.300 --> 1:48:23.740\n That's one of the big ones that's out there real popular.\n\n1:48:23.740 --> 1:48:29.900\n And so he started just, he started asking more and through his fame with Blink 182 in\n\n1:48:29.900 --> 1:48:32.340\n the band, he got more and more connected.\n\n1:48:32.340 --> 1:48:36.380\n You know, if you talk to Chris Mellon, who is an undersecretary of defense for intelligence\n\n1:48:36.380 --> 1:48:43.160\n and he's part of the Mellon dynasty, you know, from Carnegie Mellon type, very, very smart.\n\n1:48:43.160 --> 1:48:47.700\n He knows, he, he, he definitely knows how the government works cause he worked there.\n\n1:48:47.700 --> 1:48:53.740\n And so when I went down to DC to talk to people, he's one of the first people I'll go to.\n\n1:48:53.740 --> 1:49:01.460\n When I did Tucker Carlson about a month ago, month and a half ago, I asked, he texted me,\n\n1:49:01.460 --> 1:49:05.820\n I texted him, Tom, Lou to go, Hey, cause they were like, you gotta do it.\n\n1:49:05.820 --> 1:49:11.060\n Cause I turned to, I turned Tucker down a couple of times before and his, his producer\n\n1:49:11.060 --> 1:49:14.100\n had called me and I'm like, all right, I'll do it.\n\n1:49:14.100 --> 1:49:16.220\n Because those guys like, you gotta, you gotta do this for us.\n\n1:49:16.220 --> 1:49:19.260\n So from my perspective, just to give you some context.\n\n1:49:19.260 --> 1:49:23.260\n So to me, there seems to be some stigma.\n\n1:49:23.260 --> 1:49:27.140\n So I come from the scientific community and I really appreciate you talking to me today.\n\n1:49:27.140 --> 1:49:33.780\n And I think that people who listen to this include, you know, of faculty, fellow faculty\n\n1:49:33.780 --> 1:49:36.020\n at MIT and major universities.\n\n1:49:36.020 --> 1:49:43.380\n And it feels like there's some stigma to the subject from, from the scientific community.\n\n1:49:43.380 --> 1:49:48.180\n A lot of people, especially when they hear your story are like, wow, this is really interesting,\n\n1:49:48.180 --> 1:49:53.900\n but you, you don't even know you, one, you're afraid to talk about it.\n\n1:49:53.900 --> 1:49:58.480\n And two, you don't know what the next steps are, like how can we seriously try to think\n\n1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:05.580\n about what you saw, how to think about how we further look for things like it, how we\n\n1:50:05.580 --> 1:50:14.420\n develop systems and plans for how in the future we can immediately collect a lot more data\n\n1:50:14.420 --> 1:50:23.140\n and try to react properly, you know, try to communicate, try to interpret this in the\n\n1:50:23.140 --> 1:50:25.620\n best way possible from the scientific perspective.\n\n1:50:25.620 --> 1:50:31.060\n And I, I just would love to remove stigma from this subject.\n\n1:50:31.060 --> 1:50:37.420\n Well, I think that's the first step we have done in this country, an absolutely terrible\n\n1:50:37.420 --> 1:50:38.480\n job with these things.\n\n1:50:38.480 --> 1:50:42.000\n So you go, and I joke, you know, go back to Roswell.\n\n1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:46.360\n So the first reports that came out of Roswell was we have this crash flying saucer.\n\n1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:48.020\n That's literally what came out.\n\n1:50:48.020 --> 1:50:51.300\n And then magically the next day it's a weather balloon and they're showing your pieces of\n\n1:50:51.300 --> 1:50:55.380\n mylar and you go, well, that doesn't look like what they showed us yesterday.\n\n1:50:55.380 --> 1:50:58.180\n Then you get into Project Blue Book, you know, so there's that whole series about Project\n\n1:50:58.180 --> 1:50:59.180\n Blue Book.\n\n1:50:59.180 --> 1:51:01.120\n But the bottom line of Project Blue Book is it really did two things.\n\n1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:06.440\n It investigated sightings and it did everything it could to debunk and disprove to the point\n\n1:51:06.440 --> 1:51:10.380\n where it actually went to discredit, you know, to make you look.\n\n1:51:10.380 --> 1:51:15.560\n So there's always been this, I don't know if you'd call it an aura around it or a mystique\n\n1:51:15.560 --> 1:51:19.020\n about UFOs that if you're talking about them, they're nuts.\n\n1:51:19.020 --> 1:51:23.160\n With ours, because I'm not a UFO guy, I'm not a junkie.\n\n1:51:23.160 --> 1:51:29.440\n If you ask me, do I believe that there's life outside of Earth, I would say you probably\n\n1:51:29.440 --> 1:51:34.760\n have a better chance of winning the mega ball lottery than we're the only planet that has\n\n1:51:34.760 --> 1:51:36.840\n life on it in the universe.\n\n1:51:36.840 --> 1:51:38.580\n The odds are against it.\n\n1:51:38.580 --> 1:51:44.280\n If you do just do the math, you have to accept, because there only has to be one other planet\n\n1:51:44.280 --> 1:51:48.300\n that has life on it and then I win and you lose.\n\n1:51:48.300 --> 1:51:52.280\n And then more and more science is showing that there's habitable planets out there,\n\n1:51:52.280 --> 1:51:56.040\n that yeah, everything we've learned so far, we know very little, but everything we've\n\n1:51:56.040 --> 1:52:03.480\n learned so far about the planets out there, exoplanets, Earth like planets, it seems that\n\n1:52:03.480 --> 1:52:06.720\n it's very likely that there's life out there.\n\n1:52:06.720 --> 1:52:08.960\n Intelligent life is another topic, but life.\n\n1:52:08.960 --> 1:52:13.760\n Well, we as humans, you know, and even more as Americans, we have this hubris about us\n\n1:52:13.760 --> 1:52:18.680\n that says, ha ha, we're it and you go, not so much.\n\n1:52:18.680 --> 1:52:20.980\n Maybe we're not so intelligent.\n\n1:52:20.980 --> 1:52:22.840\n Because we are, it's just how we learn.\n\n1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:28.760\n So our main mode of transportation and what people figured out years ago was the internal\n\n1:52:28.760 --> 1:52:33.060\n combustion engine, which led us to jet engines and solid rocket fuel.\n\n1:52:33.060 --> 1:52:39.320\n What if you're in another planet where you figured out the ability to create a gravity\n\n1:52:39.320 --> 1:52:43.240\n field or you used, you know, because electromagnetics are becoming bigger and bigger and bigger,\n\n1:52:43.240 --> 1:52:48.560\n you know, catapults on ships were steam powered and the new Gerald Ford is electromagnetic.\n\n1:52:48.560 --> 1:52:50.840\n Roller coasters used to use a chain to get you to the top of the hill.\n\n1:52:50.840 --> 1:52:53.920\n Now they shoot you with electromagnetics and you're going.\n\n1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:57.760\n So there's a whole new realm of propulsion that, you know, sometimes it's our ability\n\n1:52:57.760 --> 1:53:00.480\n to develop the technology to support theory.\n\n1:53:00.480 --> 1:53:05.800\n You know, we are just now proving, you know, recently theories that Einstein had where\n\n1:53:05.800 --> 1:53:07.080\n people actually joked about them.\n\n1:53:07.080 --> 1:53:10.560\n And now we actually have the technology to prove that gravity can bend light.\n\n1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:12.000\n You know, we've proven that.\n\n1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:15.600\n So you look at that way and you go, well, does that mean that, you know, 70 years ago\n\n1:53:15.600 --> 1:53:17.920\n Einstein was wrong or 80 years ago Einstein was wrong?\n\n1:53:17.920 --> 1:53:22.260\n Or do you go, we just didn't have the ability to look that deep into space to actually find\n\n1:53:22.260 --> 1:53:24.600\n something that we could, to actually measure.\n\n1:53:24.600 --> 1:53:25.600\n And you know, and I've seen this stuff.\n\n1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:29.040\n And that's just a hundred years and the kind of things that can happen in a few centuries.\n\n1:53:29.040 --> 1:53:30.640\n Look what we've done in the last 20 years.\n\n1:53:30.640 --> 1:53:31.640\n Yeah, it's crazy.\n\n1:53:31.640 --> 1:53:35.600\n Let me direct, cause it's such an interesting topic from a career perspective, from a science\n\n1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:43.280\n perspective, you're, I mean, you've spoken, you've been brave in, you know, telling your\n\n1:53:43.280 --> 1:53:48.000\n story, not some dramatic thing, but just telling the things you've seen.\n\n1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:53.080\n Did it encounter, did it impact your career?\n\n1:53:53.080 --> 1:53:55.240\n Is that why more people haven't come out?\n\n1:53:55.240 --> 1:54:03.380\n Like you've mentioned Roswell, like how, what advice do you give to people, to the community,\n\n1:54:03.380 --> 1:54:11.480\n to me as a scientist for ways to go forward about this topic and still have a, you know,\n\n1:54:11.480 --> 1:54:16.880\n not being put in a bin in society that he's a loon or she's a loon or that person.\n\n1:54:16.880 --> 1:54:23.720\n Mine is to get away from the little green men, just divorce the two little green men.\n\n1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:27.400\n And you know, and I've talked to Lou Elizondo about this, you know, and the group that they're\n\n1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:28.400\n working with, which is incredible.\n\n1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:32.960\n I mean, they've got Steve Justice who used to run Skunk Works where they built, you know,\n\n1:54:32.960 --> 1:54:33.960\n projects.\n\n1:54:33.960 --> 1:54:36.560\n Now, Lou Elizondo, as you mentioned, was a program director.\n\n1:54:36.560 --> 1:54:38.520\n He ran the ATIP program at the Pentagon.\n\n1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:45.220\n And ATIP was a program that was tasked with investigating any kind of UFOs, UAPs.\n\n1:54:45.220 --> 1:54:49.640\n So what's funny is the unofficial official report that I joke about, the guy who wrote\n\n1:54:49.640 --> 1:54:53.640\n the unofficial official report was actually an original member of ATIP.\n\n1:54:53.640 --> 1:54:57.280\n And the original stuff that ATIP did was FOIA exempt.\n\n1:54:57.280 --> 1:54:58.280\n And people go, how do you know that?\n\n1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:03.040\n I go, because I stood there with the memo in my hand that said these are, it literally,\n\n1:55:03.040 --> 1:55:05.600\n I watched the DOD memo that said it and it was signed.\n\n1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:07.120\n So he was one.\n\n1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:09.600\n So that's why the, that's why I call it the unofficial official report.\n\n1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:13.520\n It was never, it was never releasable because people go, oh, I put in a FOIA request and\n\n1:55:13.520 --> 1:55:14.520\n I didn't get that.\n\n1:55:14.520 --> 1:55:17.480\n I go, well, just because you put in a FOIA request and get it, I go, because how much,\n\n1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:20.320\n how much time do you think that guy is going to spend to get you the information that you\n\n1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:21.600\n requested if he can't find it?\n\n1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:23.320\n I actually got called by the Navy.\n\n1:55:23.320 --> 1:55:29.080\n I had a commander in the Navy call me about right before the article came out in the New\n\n1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:30.080\n York Times.\n\n1:55:30.080 --> 1:55:33.000\n It was, this was starting to come back and she had called me because there's been, there\n\n1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.480\n was a FOIA request for stuff about the Nimitz incident.\n\n1:55:35.480 --> 1:55:38.000\n And I said, do you know of anything?\n\n1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:41.680\n She called me, she goes, do you know of anything else besides the situation reports that come\n\n1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:42.680\n off the ship?\n\n1:55:42.680 --> 1:55:45.780\n And you know, and you got to remember when the situation report comes off the ship, that's\n\n1:55:45.780 --> 1:55:46.780\n like third hand.\n\n1:55:46.780 --> 1:55:50.880\n So we tell someone, they tell someone, that person has to write it up.\n\n1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:54.180\n So there's all kinds of inaccuracies in it.\n\n1:55:54.180 --> 1:55:56.760\n But then there's the unofficial official report that's actually pretty well written.\n\n1:55:56.760 --> 1:55:59.360\n There's some errors in it, but it was, you know, I didn't help write it.\n\n1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:00.400\n I just did it.\n\n1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:03.720\n And he did a really good job of researching it and figuring out who's who in the zoo and\n\n1:56:03.720 --> 1:56:07.600\n the players.\n\n1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:09.120\n So she called me and said, is there anything out there?\n\n1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:10.720\n And I said, officially out there.\n\n1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:11.720\n She said, yes.\n\n1:56:11.720 --> 1:56:12.720\n I said, I don't know anything.\n\n1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:16.720\n I knew of the unofficial official report, which is that one, but I'm not, you know,\n\n1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:19.760\n if you don't know about it, I'm not going to tell you because it's not my job and nor\n\n1:56:19.760 --> 1:56:20.760\n did I care.\n\n1:56:20.760 --> 1:56:26.720\n I mean, did, in that whole situation, you mentioned Lou, I mean, did you think about\n\n1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:29.360\n your impact to your career?\n\n1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:36.080\n Just to get back to the question, do you think others, other pilots, other thing, other people\n\n1:56:36.080 --> 1:56:40.200\n like in the Roosevelt are thinking about this kind of thing, why aren't they talking about\n\n1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:41.200\n this?\n\n1:56:41.200 --> 1:56:42.680\n Why are people afraid to talk about this?\n\n1:56:42.680 --> 1:56:46.200\n Well, honestly, the military and the press, there's a distrust.\n\n1:56:46.200 --> 1:56:47.840\n I'll just tell you that right now.\n\n1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:52.920\n We typically don't like talking to the press because if I talk to you, you know, especially\n\n1:56:52.920 --> 1:56:57.320\n when I do, even the TV shows, you know, cause I've been on a couple of shows, when you look\n\n1:56:57.320 --> 1:57:00.840\n at it, you know, they come to my house and they film me for two hours.\n\n1:57:00.840 --> 1:57:03.480\n And then what you see on the screen is five minutes.\n\n1:57:03.480 --> 1:57:07.040\n Well, and the other thing with the press, let me give you my perspective from Autonomous\n\n1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:12.340\n Vehicles is the clipping happens, yes.\n\n1:57:12.340 --> 1:57:13.640\n But also the incompetence.\n\n1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:17.880\n Let me just call out journalists.\n\n1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:25.680\n They're not thinking, I mean, so here's the thing, I have a PhD and I've taken painfully\n\n1:57:25.680 --> 1:57:32.200\n too many classes from like physics, math, and I also have a deep curiosity about the\n\n1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:33.200\n world.\n\n1:57:33.200 --> 1:57:34.640\n I read a lot.\n\n1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:36.000\n That seems to be missing with journalism.\n\n1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:40.920\n So you're talking to a person who is not going to push the story forward in an interesting\n\n1:57:40.920 --> 1:57:47.600\n way, not the story, but the actual investigation of perhaps one of the most amazing things\n\n1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:49.800\n that humans have witnessed in history.\n\n1:57:49.800 --> 1:57:55.240\n Like you, it might've been nothing, who knows what you witnessed might've been from a sort\n\n1:57:55.240 --> 1:57:59.360\n of debunking perspective, might've been some kind of trick of mind.\n\n1:57:59.360 --> 1:58:05.840\n You and others have hallucinated something that could be some simple explanation, but\n\n1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:15.360\n possibly it was something not of this world and to not do justice to this story from a\n\n1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:20.840\n scientific perspective, it seems at best negligence.\n\n1:58:20.840 --> 1:58:25.340\n And so that's true for journalists, that's true for other scientists.\n\n1:58:25.340 --> 1:58:28.360\n It's just a human nature.\n\n1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:34.080\n If we see something that we can't explain, then sometimes if you just, eh, maybe it's\n\n1:58:34.080 --> 1:58:40.040\n just me and you let it go away and you don't think about it, maybe it'll just, you ignore\n\n1:58:40.040 --> 1:58:41.800\n it.\n\n1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:44.560\n The other side is the inquisitive mind that says, well, what was that?\n\n1:58:44.560 --> 1:58:47.260\n And I want to dig more into it.\n\n1:58:47.260 --> 1:58:53.920\n And if you look at it or you're going against the norm, you can get ostracized.\n\n1:58:53.920 --> 1:58:57.320\n And if you look at, and Einstein's the perfect example, I mean, when he started coming up\n\n1:58:57.320 --> 1:59:02.640\n with some of his theories, some of the top physicists in the world were like, dude, you're\n\n1:59:02.640 --> 1:59:03.640\n a nut job.\n\n1:59:03.640 --> 1:59:09.120\n He's, he's literally proving them, but he didn't have, you know, he proved them in theory,\n\n1:59:09.120 --> 1:59:13.560\n but he didn't have the means to actually do the experiment to prove his theory.\n\n1:59:13.560 --> 1:59:18.280\n There's a great book that I recommend people read called Proving Einstein Right by Jim\n\n1:59:18.280 --> 1:59:25.380\n Gates that talks about like the hard work that people try to do years after to try to\n\n1:59:25.380 --> 1:59:32.200\n experimentally validate the predictions that Einstein made with, with his theories.\n\n1:59:32.200 --> 1:59:33.200\n It's fascinating.\n\n1:59:33.200 --> 1:59:36.640\n But yes, at the time, it's kind of crazy what he's saying.\n\n1:59:36.640 --> 1:59:37.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:59:37.640 --> 1:59:40.320\n If you look at it back at the time, don't we, we look at it now and go, well, the guy\n\n1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:44.800\n was a walking genius and he was, but if you go back in time when he was doing it, it was\n\n1:59:44.800 --> 1:59:47.320\n like, what are you talking about?\n\n1:59:47.320 --> 1:59:48.320\n You know?\n\n1:59:48.320 --> 1:59:52.420\n But one of the challenges is your eyewitness.\n\n1:59:52.420 --> 1:59:56.340\n One of the challenges is you're essentially an eyewitness account.\n\n1:59:56.340 --> 1:59:58.760\n Like we don't have good data.\n\n1:59:58.760 --> 2:00:03.920\n We have very limited data of the incident that you've experienced.\n\n2:00:03.920 --> 2:00:10.880\n So let me kind of dig in, let me just ask some questions of maybe to see if there's,\n\n2:00:10.880 --> 2:00:13.120\n just to paint more and more of the picture.\n\n2:00:13.120 --> 2:00:18.640\n One you kind of mentioned, so Tic Tac Shape, let's break apart two situations.\n\n2:00:18.640 --> 2:00:19.920\n One is the video.\n\n2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:23.820\n Let's look at the actual eye account, the eyewitness account that you saw with your\n\n2:00:23.820 --> 2:00:25.320\n own eyes.\n\n2:00:25.320 --> 2:00:28.300\n What's the, what can you say about the shape of the thing?\n\n2:00:28.300 --> 2:00:30.800\n Is there interesting aspects outside of the Tic Tac?\n\n2:00:30.800 --> 2:00:33.300\n Like, is there any appendages?\n\n2:00:33.300 --> 2:00:42.320\n Is there some texture to it that, no smooth white Tic Tac, you know, we don't, you don't\n\n2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:50.680\n see there's no, no wings, no visible propulsion, no windows, no probes that we could see.\n\n2:00:50.680 --> 2:00:53.800\n We don't notice, like I said, we don't see the little things on the bottom of it until\n\n2:00:53.800 --> 2:00:59.760\n we see the video in the TV mode when it's zoomed in, right before it's shortly, you\n\n2:00:59.760 --> 2:01:00.760\n kind of see them zoom in.\n\n2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:05.840\n You don't see it typically on the YouTube stuff that's out there, or remember we're\n\n2:01:05.840 --> 2:01:09.960\n looking at the original tape, so there's not, there's basically no degradation.\n\n2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:12.680\n But when you saw with your eyes, there's no kind of appendages.\n\n2:01:12.680 --> 2:01:13.680\n No, none.\n\n2:01:13.680 --> 2:01:17.240\n What about, like somebody asked, a lot of people asked you questions.\n\n2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:19.560\n So I appreciate you spending your time here.\n\n2:01:19.560 --> 2:01:21.560\n Let me ask some of them.\n\n2:01:21.560 --> 2:01:26.200\n Did you, I mean, you chased it, so we flew close to it, relatively speaking.\n\n2:01:26.200 --> 2:01:30.160\n Was there, did you feel any wake?\n\n2:01:30.160 --> 2:01:36.240\n Like any, did you feel it in any way in terms of your interaction, like aerodynamically?\n\n2:01:36.240 --> 2:01:37.240\n No.\n\n2:01:37.240 --> 2:01:38.240\n Nothing.\n\n2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:39.240\n Nothing.\n\n2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:46.580\n So another aspect of it, there's an interesting thing you've developed a feel for, for objects\n\n2:01:46.580 --> 2:01:47.580\n in the air.\n\n2:01:47.580 --> 2:01:53.160\n Did you feel like it was surprised by your arrival?\n\n2:01:53.160 --> 2:01:56.080\n Or did it, let me ask a few questions around it.\n\n2:01:56.080 --> 2:02:00.040\n So did you, did it feel like the thing was surprised?\n\n2:02:00.040 --> 2:02:08.080\n Did it feel like it wanted to be seen, almost to show off its capability?\n\n2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:15.480\n And did it, what did it feel like relative to if you were doing a, an air fight against\n\n2:02:15.480 --> 2:02:20.280\n a sort of like a, I don't know, a foreign jet?\n\n2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:25.000\n So one, I think it, I think it knew we were there when we showed up.\n\n2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:27.000\n It's just, it's me.\n\n2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:28.000\n It's kind of like an animal.\n\n2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.920\n If you've ever been around deer in a field, you know, the deer will look up and if it\n\n2:02:30.920 --> 2:02:34.440\n sees you and you're on the other side of the field, it'll actually go no threat and it'll\n\n2:02:34.440 --> 2:02:35.440\n start eating.\n\n2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:36.440\n You know, they don't put their tail up.\n\n2:02:36.440 --> 2:02:39.320\n As you move closer to the deer, then it goes, oh, it's there and I'm going to react or I'm\n\n2:02:39.320 --> 2:02:40.800\n going to move.\n\n2:02:40.800 --> 2:02:47.440\n So as we were up high and it's down doing whatever it was doing, you know, which I don't\n\n2:02:47.440 --> 2:02:48.440\n know if someone asks, what do you think?\n\n2:02:48.440 --> 2:02:50.160\n I go, oh, maybe it was communicating with something.\n\n2:02:50.160 --> 2:02:52.080\n I joked on good morning America.\n\n2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:56.000\n Maybe it's like talking to the whales, kind of like Star Trek, you know, and actually\n\n2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:57.000\n use that clip.\n\n2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:00.200\n It was kind of funny, but yeah, we're a little human centric.\n\n2:03:00.200 --> 2:03:04.360\n We think like it would, it'd show up to talk to us, but maybe he's talking to the dolphins.\n\n2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:05.360\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:07.560\n It was to whatever, you know, cause it was hanging around that whitewater and I don't\n\n2:03:07.560 --> 2:03:09.300\n know if it was, there's something there as a seamount.\n\n2:03:09.300 --> 2:03:10.300\n We just didn't find it again.\n\n2:03:10.300 --> 2:03:11.880\n I don't know.\n\n2:03:11.880 --> 2:03:16.720\n But once we started to descend and it actually reoriented its longitudinal axis and it started\n\n2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:19.880\n mirroring us coming up and it was obviously where we were there and it was really coming\n\n2:03:19.880 --> 2:03:20.880\n up.\n\n2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:25.800\n Just, you know, you figure I'm at 20 and it's coming up and it ends up getting up to 12\n\n2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:27.200\n where I cut across the circle.\n\n2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:30.140\n I think it was very aware that we were there because it interacted.\n\n2:03:30.140 --> 2:03:34.360\n We call it a two circle fight when you're fighting another airplane.\n\n2:03:34.360 --> 2:03:40.520\n But you know, was it, was, were we afraid?\n\n2:03:40.520 --> 2:03:41.520\n I don't think so.\n\n2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:44.680\n I mean, and to me it was more curious, you know, the curiosity overcomes any fear that\n\n2:03:44.680 --> 2:03:45.680\n you would have.\n\n2:03:45.680 --> 2:03:51.240\n And I always felt to be honest, if I was inside the airplane, especially as long as much time\n\n2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:56.740\n as I'd spent inside the airplane flying and doing stuff, I felt totally, it was like a\n\n2:03:56.740 --> 2:03:57.740\n safe zone.\n\n2:03:57.740 --> 2:04:01.880\n I mean, I felt totally comfortable inside the airplane as most, you can't, if you're\n\n2:04:01.880 --> 2:04:04.620\n in the airplane and you feel scared, it's not the job for you.\n\n2:04:04.620 --> 2:04:08.120\n You have to feel that because the airplane is part of you now.\n\n2:04:08.120 --> 2:04:11.600\n You know, I am inside, I have the stick, I have the throttles, I've got my wizzo in the\n\n2:04:11.600 --> 2:04:14.280\n back seat, he's running all the displays.\n\n2:04:14.280 --> 2:04:15.280\n We are a team.\n\n2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:20.720\n We're in the state of the art airplane, you know, brand new.\n\n2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:21.720\n You feel pretty good.\n\n2:04:21.720 --> 2:04:26.320\n And then you get something that, you know, can climb from the surface up and then accelerate\n\n2:04:26.320 --> 2:04:30.160\n like it did, like it was like no big deal, you know, for an airplane, if you just put\n\n2:04:30.160 --> 2:04:34.800\n me from a standstill, let's just say slow flight, just get me at a hundred knots above\n\n2:04:34.800 --> 2:04:35.800\n the water.\n\n2:04:35.800 --> 2:04:39.520\n And for me to, you can't just start a climb, I'd have to lower the nose, I'd have to accelerate\n\n2:04:39.520 --> 2:04:44.620\n and then I'd have to start coming up and this thing just like, just did it like it was like\n\n2:04:44.620 --> 2:04:45.620\n no big deal.\n\n2:04:45.620 --> 2:04:46.620\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:46.620 --> 2:04:52.360\n You mentioned that like kind of your reaction to it was, it like, it's something that you\n\n2:04:52.360 --> 2:04:53.960\n would love to fly almost.\n\n2:04:53.960 --> 2:05:01.880\n So this object, just the curiosity you experienced is like, like what it almost like, what the\n\n2:05:01.880 --> 2:05:05.080\n heck is that piece of technology and I want to fly it.\n\n2:05:05.080 --> 2:05:10.640\n Like what made you feel like it's something that you could fly?\n\n2:05:10.640 --> 2:05:13.700\n Do you think it's something that a human could fly?\n\n2:05:13.700 --> 2:05:18.160\n Like in terms of interpreting what you saw as a piece of technology, because another\n\n2:05:18.160 --> 2:05:26.920\n perspective on it is it was not that the thing under the water was the key thing.\n\n2:05:26.920 --> 2:05:32.320\n And what you were seeing is some kind of projection or something that like, I don't think it was\n\n2:05:32.320 --> 2:05:33.320\n a projection.\n\n2:05:33.320 --> 2:05:34.320\n I think it was a real object.\n\n2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:37.400\n It was an op, a physical hard object that could be flyed.\n\n2:05:37.400 --> 2:05:38.400\n Oh yeah.\n\n2:05:38.400 --> 2:05:39.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:39.400 --> 2:05:40.880\n I think all four of us will tell you the same thing.\n\n2:05:40.880 --> 2:05:44.960\n It wasn't, it wasn't, this was not, cause you go, okay, let's just go on.\n\n2:05:44.960 --> 2:05:45.960\n It's a light projection.\n\n2:05:45.960 --> 2:05:50.080\n Well, if we were both sitting next to each other and we were looking at it from the exact\n\n2:05:50.080 --> 2:05:54.640\n same angle and all that, and I go, okay, there's a, in theory you could have that, but with\n\n2:05:54.640 --> 2:05:58.560\n an 8,000 foot altitude difference flying, you know, and they're, you know, she's probably\n\n2:05:58.560 --> 2:05:59.800\n not directly above me.\n\n2:05:59.800 --> 2:06:02.680\n She's kind of hanging out watching this whole thing happen.\n\n2:06:02.680 --> 2:06:06.760\n You know, you're getting two different perspectives from two different altitudes over a clear\n\n2:06:06.760 --> 2:06:07.760\n blue.\n\n2:06:07.760 --> 2:06:10.640\n You know, if you've ever been at sea and I don't mean like coast, I mean like when you\n\n2:06:10.640 --> 2:06:15.480\n get out at sea, the ocean is the bluest, it's incredible.\n\n2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:19.160\n You know, you've got a bright white object over a deep blue ocean that you got pretty\n\n2:06:19.160 --> 2:06:20.800\n high contrast.\n\n2:06:20.800 --> 2:06:29.880\n And for this thing just to disappear, it wasn't, I'm telling you, I would, I mean, I know we,\n\n2:06:29.880 --> 2:06:33.120\n we all have the same recollection of what happened.\n\n2:06:33.120 --> 2:06:36.560\n You know, there's some details because it's so long ago, but for the most part, we know\n\n2:06:36.560 --> 2:06:40.480\n what we saw and we all came back and looked at each other like, what the hell was that?\n\n2:06:40.480 --> 2:06:45.080\n What if, I mean, do you think about the thing under the water that's not often talked about\n\n2:06:45.080 --> 2:06:50.480\n if there's something under the water, couldn't have been something gigantic?\n\n2:06:50.480 --> 2:06:51.480\n It could be.\n\n2:06:51.480 --> 2:06:52.480\n What?\n\n2:06:52.480 --> 2:06:53.480\n Like, do you ever think of this?\n\n2:06:53.480 --> 2:06:54.480\n Big ship comes up.\n\n2:06:54.480 --> 2:06:57.840\n I mean, that's why as a person, so I love like swimming out into the ocean by miles\n\n2:06:57.840 --> 2:06:59.160\n and Olympic swimmers.\n\n2:06:59.160 --> 2:07:04.040\n Like I love that feeling, but I'm also terrified when I swim because the abyss, it could, anything\n\n2:07:04.040 --> 2:07:06.080\n could be under there.\n\n2:07:06.080 --> 2:07:12.760\n Like there's not enough focus on that perhaps because there's no visibility, but is it,\n\n2:07:12.760 --> 2:07:16.560\n is there anything interesting to say about the possibility that was anything underneath\n\n2:07:16.560 --> 2:07:17.560\n there?\n\n2:07:17.560 --> 2:07:18.560\n Could be.\n\n2:07:18.560 --> 2:07:19.560\n I mean, think about it.\n\n2:07:19.560 --> 2:07:25.480\n If you're going to hide on this planet, what's the least explored spot on the planet?\n\n2:07:25.480 --> 2:07:28.080\n Two thirds of it's the ocean.\n\n2:07:28.080 --> 2:07:34.840\n There's literally, I mean, come on, the Malaysia airplane, the triple seven, it was a triple\n\n2:07:34.840 --> 2:07:35.840\n seven that crashed.\n\n2:07:35.840 --> 2:07:38.640\n You know, they turned, they didn't go where they're supposed to and they just disappeared\n\n2:07:38.640 --> 2:07:42.320\n and they've been searching for it and they found pieces of it, but you would think there's\n\n2:07:42.320 --> 2:07:46.600\n large objects that, you know, when that thing hit the water, depending on how it broke up,\n\n2:07:46.600 --> 2:07:49.480\n there's big pieces that would be, you'd find something, they haven't found anything except\n\n2:07:49.480 --> 2:07:50.480\n what floated.\n\n2:07:50.480 --> 2:07:54.720\n So to hide something underwater I think would be easy.\n\n2:07:54.720 --> 2:07:55.720\n So okay.\n\n2:07:55.720 --> 2:08:00.000\n Let's go a little bit in speculation land, but it's the best, it's the best we can do,\n\n2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:05.040\n which is the basic question of what do you think was it?\n\n2:08:05.040 --> 2:08:11.880\n So if you had to put money on it, is it like advanced human created technology?\n\n2:08:11.880 --> 2:08:13.720\n Is it alien technology?\n\n2:08:13.720 --> 2:08:16.880\n Is it an unknown physical phenomena?\n\n2:08:16.880 --> 2:08:20.440\n You know, like a ball lightning, for example, there's a lot of fascinating things we probably\n\n2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:22.440\n humans don't really understand.\n\n2:08:22.440 --> 2:08:29.040\n Is it like I said, some perception cognition that led you some kind of hallucination that\n\n2:08:29.040 --> 2:08:31.240\n made you to misinterpret the things you were seeing?\n\n2:08:31.240 --> 2:08:33.600\n Let me put those things on the table.\n\n2:08:33.600 --> 2:08:39.520\n Or is it misinterpretation of some known physical phenomena like an ice cloud or something like\n\n2:08:39.520 --> 2:08:40.520\n that?\n\n2:08:40.520 --> 2:08:41.520\n What do you think it was?\n\n2:08:41.520 --> 2:08:42.520\n Definitely.\n\n2:08:42.520 --> 2:08:47.480\n I don't think it's an ice cloud because ice clouds don't fly around and react to you.\n\n2:08:47.480 --> 2:08:49.080\n Do I think it was a light?\n\n2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:52.280\n I'd say no, because of the aspects and what we looked and watched it do.\n\n2:08:52.280 --> 2:08:53.280\n I'd say no.\n\n2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:54.720\n What do you mean by light?\n\n2:08:54.720 --> 2:08:59.840\n Like a light ball, you know, some type of perception, you know, there's their experience\n\n2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:04.000\n like plasma, you can do plasma and you can go, oh, I can see it, but it's really not,\n\n2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:05.240\n you know, it's plasma.\n\n2:09:05.240 --> 2:09:07.240\n I don't think so.\n\n2:09:07.240 --> 2:09:09.760\n So you would see distortions, I think, as it moved.\n\n2:09:09.760 --> 2:09:10.760\n Maybe not.\n\n2:09:10.760 --> 2:09:16.280\n I'm not a theoretical physicist and some, you know, I'm not an MIT.\n\n2:09:16.280 --> 2:09:21.880\n I would say no, I mean, it looked from all my experience and I had quite a bit of it\n\n2:09:21.880 --> 2:09:27.240\n when this happened, no, I think it was a hard object.\n\n2:09:27.240 --> 2:09:28.620\n It was aware that we were there.\n\n2:09:28.620 --> 2:09:33.560\n It reacted exactly like if I was another airplane and I had to come up and do something exactly\n\n2:09:33.560 --> 2:09:35.180\n what I would do.\n\n2:09:35.180 --> 2:09:36.180\n You know, it mirrored me.\n\n2:09:36.180 --> 2:09:37.720\n It wasn't aggressive.\n\n2:09:37.720 --> 2:09:39.840\n You know, there's talk, oh, it flopped behind us.\n\n2:09:39.840 --> 2:09:41.320\n It was never offensive on us.\n\n2:09:41.320 --> 2:09:42.680\n It never did that.\n\n2:09:42.680 --> 2:09:43.680\n It just mirrored us.\n\n2:09:43.680 --> 2:09:47.920\n So as we're coming down, it's just like, you know, you're kind of, you know, you said you\n\n2:09:47.920 --> 2:09:52.840\n do martial arts, you know, or wrestling, you know, you see people out on the, when they\n\n2:09:52.840 --> 2:09:55.980\n get into the ring, especially with collegiate wrestling, cause my roommate in college was\n\n2:09:55.980 --> 2:09:56.980\n a collegiate wrestler.\n\n2:09:56.980 --> 2:10:01.640\n So I de facto became a wrestler cause he beat me up every night and we joke.\n\n2:10:01.640 --> 2:10:05.760\n I talked to him literally probably three, four times a week.\n\n2:10:05.760 --> 2:10:08.480\n But you know, you see wrestlers when they get out, they kind of, you're kind of feeling\n\n2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:10.840\n each other as you walk and boxers do the same thing.\n\n2:10:10.840 --> 2:10:11.840\n It was doing that same thing.\n\n2:10:11.840 --> 2:10:15.640\n It's like, what's going on as it comes around, as it comes around and then it was like, Hey,\n\n2:10:15.640 --> 2:10:16.640\n we're going to get here.\n\n2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:19.920\n And then when I got too close to it, you know, it decided I'm out of here.\n\n2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:22.220\n And then it did something that we've never seen.\n\n2:10:22.220 --> 2:10:25.240\n The other question is what if I didn't cut across the circle, what if I just kept going\n\n2:10:25.240 --> 2:10:26.240\n around a circle?\n\n2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:27.240\n We just keep going.\n\n2:10:27.240 --> 2:10:28.240\n I could have just watched it.\n\n2:10:28.240 --> 2:10:32.440\n I mean, my one regret out of the whole thing is we have a camera in our helmet and the\n\n2:10:32.440 --> 2:10:33.440\n joint helmet.\n\n2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:35.920\n There's a little camera, but we never use it because it's nauseating to watch because\n\n2:10:35.920 --> 2:10:38.600\n you've ever put a GoPro on someone's head where they're looking around like this all\n\n2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:40.860\n the time, it'll nauseate you.\n\n2:10:40.860 --> 2:10:44.200\n So we never turn that on and all, you know, it's the one thing I didn't do is reach down\n\n2:10:44.200 --> 2:10:47.840\n and hit the switch, you know, and then we didn't go back and cause our tapes didn't\n\n2:10:47.840 --> 2:10:51.800\n have anything cause we didn't get it on radar.\n\n2:10:51.800 --> 2:10:55.520\n Because I tried to lock it up because I can move the radar with my head, but I couldn't,\n\n2:10:55.520 --> 2:10:56.520\n it wouldn't lock.\n\n2:10:56.520 --> 2:10:57.520\n The radar wouldn't lock.\n\n2:10:57.520 --> 2:11:04.440\n And so, so then the question is, and this is unanswerable, but let's try to get some\n\n2:11:04.440 --> 2:11:05.760\n hints at it.\n\n2:11:05.760 --> 2:11:12.240\n Do you think it's human, like advanced human created technology that's simply top secret\n\n2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:15.160\n that we're just not aware of?\n\n2:11:15.160 --> 2:11:18.620\n Or is it not something not of this world?\n\n2:11:18.620 --> 2:11:26.120\n So you, if you'd asked me in 2004, I just said, I don't know if you ask me now.\n\n2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:34.760\n So we're coming up on 16 years ago for a technology like that, you know, and let's assume that\n\n2:11:34.760 --> 2:11:40.720\n it didn't have a conventional propulsion system in it because I don't think it did.\n\n2:11:40.720 --> 2:11:44.760\n I would like to think that if we had a technology that would advance mankind leaps and bounds\n\n2:11:44.760 --> 2:11:48.060\n from what we normally do, then it would start coming out.\n\n2:11:48.060 --> 2:11:53.280\n But to hide something like that for 16 years, you know, and I understand, you know, and\n\n2:11:53.280 --> 2:11:56.160\n I don't speak for the United States government and I never will speak for the United States\n\n2:11:56.160 --> 2:11:59.020\n government, but I understand how some of that stuff works for classification levels and\n\n2:11:59.020 --> 2:12:03.400\n why we classify stuff, you know, is it detrimental to national defense?\n\n2:12:03.400 --> 2:12:06.680\n But there's a point where you have to look and go, if we had a technology like this that\n\n2:12:06.680 --> 2:12:13.960\n could literally change the way mankind travels, how we get things into space, our ability\n\n2:12:13.960 --> 2:12:17.080\n to do things, you know, you talk about, you know, are we going to go to Mars?\n\n2:12:17.080 --> 2:12:20.120\n Well, if you have something that has the ability to go, because remember, these things were\n\n2:12:20.120 --> 2:12:24.400\n coming down when the cruiser tractor from above 80,000 feet, which is space, and they\n\n2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:27.640\n would come down and they would come straight down, they'd hang out at like 20,000 feet\n\n2:12:27.640 --> 2:12:30.000\n and then three or four hours later, they'd go back up.\n\n2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:34.620\n You don't have anything that can come down, hang out and once, you know, and I'm talking\n\n2:12:34.620 --> 2:12:35.620\n hold out in a spot.\n\n2:12:35.620 --> 2:12:36.720\n Well, we all know there's winds.\n\n2:12:36.720 --> 2:12:38.020\n They're not drifting like a balloon.\n\n2:12:38.020 --> 2:12:42.320\n They're just sitting there and then they would go back up and they tracked up to the, when\n\n2:12:42.320 --> 2:12:46.180\n I talked to the controller, he's like, we've seen up to 10 of these things.\n\n2:12:46.180 --> 2:12:50.120\n There's other guys and it was raining and all this other, let's just say they tracked\n\n2:12:50.120 --> 2:12:55.320\n a groups of these things coming down, hanging out and going up.\n\n2:12:55.320 --> 2:12:59.280\n So it's not just propulsion and the way it moves, it's also fuel.\n\n2:12:59.280 --> 2:13:00.280\n It's everything.\n\n2:13:00.280 --> 2:13:01.280\n So...\n\n2:13:01.280 --> 2:13:08.200\n The whole of it indicates a kind of technology that's highly advanced, but you don't think\n\n2:13:08.200 --> 2:13:14.600\n in your sense that you actually don't know, but you know more than a lot of people, in\n\n2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:20.200\n your sense, the top secret military technology, if you think about skunkworks, if you think\n\n2:13:20.200 --> 2:13:25.240\n about it like that, cannot be more than 15 years ahead.\n\n2:13:25.240 --> 2:13:32.480\n I would say for a leap like that, and a perfect example in modern times is the 117.\n\n2:13:32.480 --> 2:13:36.480\n Because now a lot of the data on the 117 is out like it was developed at this time.\n\n2:13:36.480 --> 2:13:40.000\n It flew for this long before it was actually acknowledged by the United States government.\n\n2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:41.000\n What's the 117?\n\n2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:44.560\n That's the stealth fighter, the original stealth fighter, not the B2, but the stealth fighter.\n\n2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:51.520\n So you look at that, you know, yeah, you can, I think you can hide things for a while.\n\n2:13:51.520 --> 2:13:56.440\n But I think a technology, a leap, I mean, this is not a, hey, we developed this and\n\n2:13:56.440 --> 2:14:00.000\n we're kind of pushing the edge of technology.\n\n2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:02.400\n This is a giant leap in technology.\n\n2:14:02.400 --> 2:14:06.160\n You know, and the other one is, do we have the basis to do that?\n\n2:14:06.160 --> 2:14:10.360\n You know, because usually when you have a technology like that, universities, especially\n\n2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:15.300\n the one you're working at, MIT, a lot of the leading edge stuff is coming out of the top\n\n2:14:15.300 --> 2:14:19.480\n tier universities, you know, so you've got MIT, you've got Caltech, you've got Stanford,\n\n2:14:19.480 --> 2:14:24.680\n Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, Carnegie Mellon, I'm just naming schools, Naval Postgraduate\n\n2:14:24.680 --> 2:14:27.400\n School is another one.\n\n2:14:27.400 --> 2:14:31.360\n There's usually indicators, there's papers of, hey, this is where we're going.\n\n2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:36.260\n I don't think there's a whole bunch of papers on developing a gravity based propulsion system\n\n2:14:36.260 --> 2:14:41.040\n that literally, I've got an object, because how do you, how much power would it cost to\n\n2:14:41.040 --> 2:14:46.980\n create a gravity field of your own that could actually be strong enough to counter the giant\n\n2:14:46.980 --> 2:14:48.400\n orb that we live on?\n\n2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:50.560\n Also by the way, you mentioned gravity based.\n\n2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:56.080\n That's kind of like the hypothesizing that people do in terms of propulsion, like what\n\n2:14:56.080 --> 2:15:03.240\n kind of propulsion would have to be involved in order to result in that kind of movement.\n\n2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:07.320\n To me, all the gravity discussion just seems insane from a physics perspective, but of\n\n2:15:07.320 --> 2:15:13.880\n course it would seem insane until it's not.\n\n2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:19.280\n Because remember, we only know what we know, which is very little.\n\n2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:27.360\n Someone has to think out of the box to go, is this possible at all?\n\n2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:32.560\n So you're saying that if you had to bet money, all your money, it would be something that's\n\n2:15:32.560 --> 2:15:37.320\n alien technology, so it's not human created technology.\n\n2:15:37.320 --> 2:15:41.360\n Well, I don't like to get into little green men, but I would say that I don't think we've\n\n2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:42.360\n developed it.\n\n2:15:42.360 --> 2:15:45.280\n I don't think we've developed it.\n\n2:15:45.280 --> 2:15:48.080\n Because the other one, someone asked me, they said, what if there wasn't, maybe it was just\n\n2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:53.640\n a drone, maybe it was a UAV that got sent here from someplace else.\n\n2:15:53.640 --> 2:15:57.600\n I mean, we've got stuff out there flying around.\n\n2:15:57.600 --> 2:15:59.800\n So I don't know.\n\n2:15:59.800 --> 2:16:03.800\n I mean, I'd like to sit around and talk to some of the giant brains that think this stuff\n\n2:16:03.800 --> 2:16:04.800\n up.\n\n2:16:04.800 --> 2:16:07.680\n I was supposed to be on a podcast with one of them.\n\n2:16:07.680 --> 2:16:08.920\n Which topic?\n\n2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:11.240\n Which you mean for drones?\n\n2:16:11.240 --> 2:16:14.120\n Just space travel technology.\n\n2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:18.040\n Because if you look at where we're going, because everyone talks about Mars, and you're\n\n2:16:18.040 --> 2:16:20.760\n okay, and we're, hey, are we going to be able to colonize?\n\n2:16:20.760 --> 2:16:22.080\n And I know Elon is big into that.\n\n2:16:22.080 --> 2:16:26.060\n Yeah, what do you think about Elon, SpaceX, NASA?\n\n2:16:26.060 --> 2:16:29.720\n We put humans back up there.\n\n2:16:29.720 --> 2:16:35.520\n My theory, so it's funny because I know one of the guys that was, he was one of the original\n\n2:16:35.520 --> 2:16:37.160\n employees at SpaceX.\n\n2:16:37.160 --> 2:16:39.920\n He's a friend of mine, and I won't say his name.\n\n2:16:39.920 --> 2:16:40.920\n But he knows Elon.\n\n2:16:40.920 --> 2:16:45.280\n And he actually worked on the entire Falcon 1 project.\n\n2:16:45.280 --> 2:16:46.360\n He's one of the lead guys on that.\n\n2:16:46.360 --> 2:16:49.760\n So he's got some great, as a matter of fact, there's a movie, there's a book coming out\n\n2:16:49.760 --> 2:16:51.440\n that comes out in about a year on this.\n\n2:16:51.440 --> 2:16:55.080\n The original, the first years of space, first six years of SpaceX.\n\n2:16:55.080 --> 2:16:56.080\n And he's named in the book.\n\n2:16:56.080 --> 2:16:57.600\n And they're supposed to make a movie on it.\n\n2:16:57.600 --> 2:17:00.120\n So I'm like, hey, who's going to play it?\n\n2:17:00.120 --> 2:17:04.920\n But what he's done, to me, it changed the game, and here's why.\n\n2:17:04.920 --> 2:17:10.480\n Because I said, I think it was 62 when Eisenhower warned of the industrial defense complex.\n\n2:17:10.480 --> 2:17:17.000\n Which it has become, everything he warned us of, it has become, and it's really driven\n\n2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:23.840\n by, there's the big three in defense, which is really Northrop, Lockheed, and Boeing.\n\n2:17:23.840 --> 2:17:28.040\n Those are the big, those are your biggest, and Raytheon's kind of right, like a subset\n\n2:17:28.040 --> 2:17:29.040\n of that.\n\n2:17:29.040 --> 2:17:30.040\n But Raytheon's pretty big too.\n\n2:17:30.040 --> 2:17:32.400\n But in US defense, those are the big guys, right?\n\n2:17:32.400 --> 2:17:37.440\n That's actually where a lot of military guys go when they retire, they go do stuff like\n\n2:17:37.440 --> 2:17:38.440\n that.\n\n2:17:38.440 --> 2:17:41.760\n And you look at that, and you go, and the way government contracting is working, and\n\n2:17:41.760 --> 2:17:44.240\n how we charge, and why things cost so much.\n\n2:17:44.240 --> 2:17:50.840\n And then you go, you got Elon, who's got an ego, and he doesn't like to do things a certain\n\n2:17:50.840 --> 2:17:51.840\n way.\n\n2:17:51.840 --> 2:17:54.680\n And I've talked to the guy that worked there on, because the government likes to have oversight\n\n2:17:54.680 --> 2:17:58.040\n of contracts, where he was like, no, just tell me what you want, I'll build it, and\n\n2:17:58.040 --> 2:17:59.560\n I'll give you a bill when it's done.\n\n2:17:59.560 --> 2:18:03.280\n And then if I do it for half the price, I make a ton of money, because he's a money\n\n2:18:03.280 --> 2:18:07.520\n driven guy, which I like, capitalism at its best.\n\n2:18:07.520 --> 2:18:08.880\n So now you look at the two things.\n\n2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:13.280\n So you got the SpaceX, which is the Dragon capsule, right?\n\n2:18:13.280 --> 2:18:15.560\n And then you've got Boeing.\n\n2:18:15.560 --> 2:18:21.440\n So Elon did what Boeing is contracted to do in less time for half the money.\n\n2:18:21.440 --> 2:18:26.000\n And oh, by the way, because he can reuse the boosters, because they come back and land,\n\n2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:29.320\n and you don't have to, like Morton Thicol, we've reused them on the space shuttle.\n\n2:18:29.320 --> 2:18:31.960\n But they had to take them all apart and do a bunch of stuff, because they landed in Saltwater,\n\n2:18:31.960 --> 2:18:34.000\n and then he had to put them all back together.\n\n2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:36.840\n Where Elon gets them down, because I was joking with this guy, go, what do they do?\n\n2:18:36.840 --> 2:18:40.440\n Do they like rehaul, overhaul, because no, actually they clean them up, and they can\n\n2:18:40.440 --> 2:18:41.440\n use them again.\n\n2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:43.660\n They're reusable systems.\n\n2:18:43.660 --> 2:18:47.040\n Incredible leap in technology that no one thought of, but here's a private company.\n\n2:18:47.040 --> 2:18:50.680\n So being able to put people in the capsule and the spacesuits, I mean, it's literally\n\n2:18:50.680 --> 2:18:52.840\n like sci fi when you watch when they went up.\n\n2:18:52.840 --> 2:18:59.520\n So I'm a huge fan of what he and his company have been able to do, because the fact that\n\n2:18:59.520 --> 2:19:03.560\n we were paying huge amounts of money to the Russian government, and oh, by the way, if\n\n2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:07.880\n you didn't know, because I have some friends that are astronauts, they all have to learn\n\n2:19:07.880 --> 2:19:08.880\n Russian.\n\n2:19:08.880 --> 2:19:09.880\n Right?\n\n2:19:09.880 --> 2:19:14.040\n And they have to do, it's what, level five, where the test is a phone call, where they\n\n2:19:14.040 --> 2:19:19.720\n call you up and they, because they would go, so I went to the pinning, two friends of mine.\n\n2:19:19.720 --> 2:19:21.800\n The one actually had a mission date, the one got one later.\n\n2:19:21.800 --> 2:19:26.080\n So it's cool when you're watching your friends doing a spacewalk, because I would pull up,\n\n2:19:26.080 --> 2:19:27.960\n because if I knew what was going on, I'd pull up the NASA thing.\n\n2:19:27.960 --> 2:19:32.960\n I was in a meeting one day, and I've got NASA on and makers out there floating around doing\n\n2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:33.960\n his stuff.\n\n2:19:33.960 --> 2:19:36.280\n And I saw one, he's in the space station while they're doing a spacewalk, so it's kind of\n\n2:19:36.280 --> 2:19:40.780\n cool when you go, oh yeah, I know that dude, he's up there in space, floating around.\n\n2:19:40.780 --> 2:19:47.940\n So when you look at what those, they're capable of doing, and then you go, what Elon is bringing\n\n2:19:47.940 --> 2:19:56.300\n to the fact that now it's back in America, it's actually, to me, it's cost effective\n\n2:19:56.300 --> 2:19:58.400\n for us to be able to do more stuff.\n\n2:19:58.400 --> 2:20:01.960\n I think it opens the door to, do we go back to the moon?\n\n2:20:01.960 --> 2:20:03.360\n Is there a reason to go back to the moon?\n\n2:20:03.360 --> 2:20:07.160\n Personally, I think if they're really going to go, in years from now, go to Mars, I think\n\n2:20:07.160 --> 2:20:11.760\n that the moon is the stepping stone to go back, to start proving some of the technology,\n\n2:20:11.760 --> 2:20:15.600\n to go, hey, we can build this, we can get on the moon, and now we can get back off the\n\n2:20:15.600 --> 2:20:17.480\n moon.\n\n2:20:17.480 --> 2:20:22.680\n Because we did this on less than a compact computer in the 60s, which is the whole reason\n\n2:20:22.680 --> 2:20:24.000\n that I flew, because I'm obsessed.\n\n2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:29.720\n Matter of fact, I have the giant Lego Apollo at home, and the Lander, and I have one that\n\n2:20:29.720 --> 2:20:35.400\n my dad built me in 1969, right after that, and Neil Armstrong's an Ohio boy, and so\n\n2:20:35.400 --> 2:20:36.400\n am I.\n\n2:20:36.400 --> 2:20:39.680\n Matter of fact, I have a picture of him in a car in Wapakonet, Ohio, at the parade after\n\n2:20:39.680 --> 2:20:42.680\n he walked on the moon, because his parents didn't live far from my aunt and uncle in\n\n2:20:42.680 --> 2:20:45.140\n Wapakoneta, and they were out at the parade.\n\n2:20:45.140 --> 2:20:48.440\n So I've been obsessed with this since I was a child.\n\n2:20:48.440 --> 2:20:55.440\n Do you hope to, do you think, do you hope that you'll go out to space one day?\n\n2:20:55.440 --> 2:20:56.440\n Me?\n\n2:20:56.440 --> 2:20:58.880\n If I had the opportunity, I'd go in a second.\n\n2:20:58.880 --> 2:20:59.880\n I am not.\n\n2:20:59.880 --> 2:21:03.960\n Because, I mean, that's one of the hopes of the commercial space flight, is that, you\n\n2:21:03.960 --> 2:21:09.880\n know, like people like, I mean, it would be tourism, but you certainly wouldn't want to,\n\n2:21:09.880 --> 2:21:14.320\n in terms of, you're not kind of a civilian, right, I mean, in a sense that you're just\n\n2:21:14.320 --> 2:21:20.360\n a normal person, you're not a 5G pilot currently, but it seems like if we send a civilian up,\n\n2:21:20.360 --> 2:21:24.280\n there would be somebody like you in the next, like, 20 years.\n\n2:21:24.280 --> 2:21:27.080\n I'd be, you know, if Elon wants to throw me on one of those things, I'd be all over\n\n2:21:27.080 --> 2:21:28.080\n it.\n\n2:21:28.080 --> 2:21:31.200\n I'd be like, okay, but, you know, sometimes you gotta get your kicks while you're alive.\n\n2:21:31.200 --> 2:21:33.000\n I'd love to hear that discussion with your wife.\n\n2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:34.880\n Listen, there's the pros and cons.\n\n2:21:34.880 --> 2:21:40.800\n She's, I mean, I've known her since high school, so she, yeah, she knows how I am, you know.\n\n2:21:40.800 --> 2:21:43.280\n Most people that know me are like, yeah, you're pretty much the same person you were in high\n\n2:21:43.280 --> 2:21:44.280\n school.\n\n2:21:44.280 --> 2:21:47.600\n You know, I was a class clown and I still am that way.\n\n2:21:47.600 --> 2:21:49.560\n So let me ask you this question.\n\n2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:57.240\n So I'm talking to Elon again soon, I'm curious to get your perspective on it.\n\n2:21:57.240 --> 2:22:05.240\n If I wanted to talk to him about TICTAC, about these weird out there propulsion ideas, which\n\n2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:10.160\n are obviously, just like you said, if there's something to it, if it can be investigated\n\n2:22:10.160 --> 2:22:16.120\n somehow, it would be extremely useful for us to understand in the effort of developing\n\n2:22:16.120 --> 2:22:21.520\n propulsion systems that can get us cheaply out to space.\n\n2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:23.460\n What should Elon think about this stuff?\n\n2:22:23.460 --> 2:22:24.520\n What should he do?\n\n2:22:24.520 --> 2:22:25.960\n What should people like him do?\n\n2:22:25.960 --> 2:22:31.560\n I think people need to open their aperture up and stay off of, take the next step and\n\n2:22:31.560 --> 2:22:38.360\n go, you know, we are tied to fuels and either solid rocket or liquid or whatever we do,\n\n2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:43.760\n but it's a thrust generated where we rapidly expand gas to create thrust, which is really\n\n2:22:43.760 --> 2:22:48.780\n in layman's terms, you know, we can get into what, but that's what it does.\n\n2:22:48.780 --> 2:22:56.500\n If you have something that you can contain that is a fuel source that would last a significant\n\n2:22:56.500 --> 2:23:00.460\n amount of time, you know, those rocket boosters go and when they're done, they're done.\n\n2:23:00.460 --> 2:23:02.200\n There's enough to get them back down and that's it.\n\n2:23:02.200 --> 2:23:05.020\n There's not a huge, you know, they're not coming back and go, oh, I still got three\n\n2:23:05.020 --> 2:23:06.020\n quarters of a tank.\n\n2:23:06.020 --> 2:23:07.560\n Let's bolt them on and do it again.\n\n2:23:07.560 --> 2:23:10.720\n His system's not doing that.\n\n2:23:10.720 --> 2:23:15.200\n But you know, the way contracting, especially in the government, the government has tons\n\n2:23:15.200 --> 2:23:19.200\n of money, but you got to remember the government has to justify how they spend our tax dollars\n\n2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:20.200\n for the most part.\n\n2:23:20.200 --> 2:23:24.040\n There are times where they can hide money in the budget to get stuff done.\n\n2:23:24.040 --> 2:23:26.600\n But then when you look at, and I'm just going to throw a few out there, but if you look\n\n2:23:26.600 --> 2:23:36.120\n at what Amazon, you know, does with Bezos and you've got Elon, there's some big money\n\n2:23:36.120 --> 2:23:37.120\n out there.\n\n2:23:37.120 --> 2:23:43.280\n I mean, you're talking, you know, Bezos alone could buy companies like big companies.\n\n2:23:43.280 --> 2:23:44.280\n Apple's another one.\n\n2:23:44.280 --> 2:23:47.800\n These companies had huge, huge amounts of money.\n\n2:23:47.800 --> 2:23:52.120\n And then just go over to the Gates Foundation and they've got gazillions and gazillions\n\n2:23:52.120 --> 2:23:53.120\n of dollars.\n\n2:23:53.120 --> 2:23:54.120\n We've got universities.\n\n2:23:54.120 --> 2:23:55.160\n There's so much money out there.\n\n2:23:55.160 --> 2:23:59.880\n If we really wanted to do it, aside from what the government wants to do, because we do\n\n2:23:59.880 --> 2:24:05.720\n live in a free society, I think there's enough to go, how do we do this?\n\n2:24:05.720 --> 2:24:11.400\n And because when you work outside of what the government would want to do, let's, we're\n\n2:24:11.400 --> 2:24:16.160\n not working on this necessarily for the United States, although I am a huge giant.\n\n2:24:16.160 --> 2:24:17.160\n I will be.\n\n2:24:17.160 --> 2:24:18.160\n American.\n\n2:24:18.160 --> 2:24:19.160\n I would never.\n\n2:24:19.160 --> 2:24:20.160\n Yeah.\n\n2:24:20.160 --> 2:24:21.160\n I am an American.\n\n2:24:21.160 --> 2:24:22.160\n You're talking to somebody born in the Soviet.\n\n2:24:22.160 --> 2:24:23.160\n I can't believe you agreed to this.\n\n2:24:23.160 --> 2:24:32.040\n But, but when I haven't killed me yet, you're here and you've been here for a while.\n\n2:24:32.040 --> 2:24:33.040\n No, no, no.\n\n2:24:33.040 --> 2:24:34.040\n I'm joking.\n\n2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:35.040\n I'm an American citizen.\n\n2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:36.040\n I'm actually pretty much American.\n\n2:24:36.040 --> 2:24:39.680\n But see, when you do that, so you look at, let's just look at American universities.\n\n2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:40.680\n Yes.\n\n2:24:40.680 --> 2:24:43.840\n There are some brilliant minds and we'll just use MIT because you worked down there.\n\n2:24:43.840 --> 2:24:46.880\n There's some brilliant minds, but there's a huge chunk of those brilliant minds that\n\n2:24:46.880 --> 2:24:48.160\n are not American citizens.\n\n2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:51.760\n So if you want to get into government stuff and you are not an American citizen, it gets\n\n2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:53.960\n really, really, really hard.\n\n2:24:53.960 --> 2:24:59.140\n But if I take money like Bezos money, Elon money, and they, let's just say they want\n\n2:24:59.140 --> 2:25:00.500\n to work together.\n\n2:25:00.500 --> 2:25:04.580\n They can split it up 50, 50, the two of them when the technology gets developed.\n\n2:25:04.580 --> 2:25:07.120\n But now I'm not constrained by who has to do the work.\n\n2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:11.400\n I just want to make sure that I try and keep it in the United States because technology\n\n2:25:11.400 --> 2:25:12.400\n is technology.\n\n2:25:12.400 --> 2:25:17.380\n And if it gets developed and gets over to where a country gets a hold of it and then\n\n2:25:17.380 --> 2:25:21.640\n just basically uses it for their own, because you save them all the research time, you don't\n\n2:25:21.640 --> 2:25:22.720\n want to do that.\n\n2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:25.660\n But if we can get to the point where we can, we do it on the International Space Station.\n\n2:25:25.660 --> 2:25:29.900\n We realize that space was too expensive for one country to do alone.\n\n2:25:29.900 --> 2:25:34.640\n So we made the International Space Station and we have a conglomerate.\n\n2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:38.200\n That's the one thing that the Russians and the U.S. actually work together on.\n\n2:25:38.200 --> 2:25:39.200\n Think about it.\n\n2:25:39.200 --> 2:25:40.200\n That's it.\n\n2:25:40.200 --> 2:25:43.760\n We work together on space because we realize it's way too expensive for us to do alone\n\n2:25:43.760 --> 2:25:45.120\n and effective.\n\n2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:47.960\n So we've got this thing that's been out there floating around for God, now what is it, like\n\n2:25:47.960 --> 2:25:50.080\n 20 years that thing's been up there floating around?\n\n2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:51.080\n So it's getting old.\n\n2:25:51.080 --> 2:25:52.760\n We're going to have to replace parts and do stuff.\n\n2:25:52.760 --> 2:25:56.720\n But if we can pool the money together and come up with something that would literally\n\n2:25:56.720 --> 2:26:01.240\n change mankind and change travel and allow us to actually do a more effective thing of\n\n2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:06.200\n engineering, because if you develop that technology, you don't even have to send a man person.\n\n2:26:06.200 --> 2:26:10.120\n If you can develop a technology that's so, and with our automation and where we're progressing\n\n2:26:10.120 --> 2:26:15.800\n and our competing power to send something out that's not just floating around when,\n\n2:26:15.800 --> 2:26:20.160\n you know, that can react a lot quicker, something that could actually go down to the surface\n\n2:26:20.160 --> 2:26:21.160\n and come back up.\n\n2:26:21.160 --> 2:26:23.680\n So right now, everything we get out of Mars, it goes down there and then it just sends\n\n2:26:23.680 --> 2:26:24.680\n data back.\n\n2:26:24.680 --> 2:26:25.680\n Get an analyzer.\n\n2:26:25.680 --> 2:26:28.600\n But if I've got a technology that can go up there really quick, I'm not worried about\n\n2:26:28.600 --> 2:26:29.600\n man.\n\n2:26:29.600 --> 2:26:30.600\n I don't have life support systems and all that.\n\n2:26:30.600 --> 2:26:34.640\n But if it can go down, it can go, it can cruise around, it can hover above, it can take samples\n\n2:26:34.640 --> 2:26:38.600\n and it can actually take Martian soil and then bring it back.\n\n2:26:38.600 --> 2:26:39.600\n So we can analyze it here.\n\n2:26:39.600 --> 2:26:40.600\n That's a game changer.\n\n2:26:40.600 --> 2:26:44.520\n It's a complete game changer because it opens up all the planets.\n\n2:26:44.520 --> 2:26:45.520\n Exactly.\n\n2:26:45.520 --> 2:26:50.360\n So in a sense, the Tic Tac is a symbol.\n\n2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:56.020\n So whatever you think, even from a debunking perspective, there's a nonzero probability\n\n2:26:56.020 --> 2:26:58.520\n that it's alien technology.\n\n2:26:58.520 --> 2:27:06.920\n In that sense, it serves as a beacon of hope and a reason to, like you said, widen the\n\n2:27:06.920 --> 2:27:13.880\n aperture and to invest big amounts of money into thinking outside the box.\n\n2:27:13.880 --> 2:27:21.240\n It's almost a hope to say we can do better propulsion.\n\n2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:27.200\n We can overcome physics in an order of magnitude better way and it's worthwhile to try.\n\n2:27:27.200 --> 2:27:30.400\n I think, and I don't think the money, if you look at a big picture with the amount of money,\n\n2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:34.320\n some that's out there floating around these private companies, I think if you said, hey,\n\n2:27:34.320 --> 2:27:37.720\n I've got, let's just say a hundred million dollars, which really a hundred million dollars\n\n2:27:37.720 --> 2:27:41.560\n relative to Bezos has got, what, a hundred and some billion dollars in that work.\n\n2:27:41.560 --> 2:27:45.520\n So if he said, hey, a hundred million dollars, you drop a hundred million dollars and I go\n\n2:27:45.520 --> 2:27:50.440\n and I'm going to put a, like the government will send a broad area announcement out that\n\n2:27:50.440 --> 2:27:53.520\n says, hey, we're looking for this technology or a DARPA program.\n\n2:27:53.520 --> 2:27:57.920\n But what if I just said, hey, who's to stop Bezos and Elon from doing that on their own\n\n2:27:57.920 --> 2:28:01.720\n to say, hey, I want to go pool universities because they have fewer restrictions because\n\n2:28:01.720 --> 2:28:02.720\n it's not tax dollars.\n\n2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:03.720\n They don't have the checks inbound.\n\n2:28:03.720 --> 2:28:04.720\n They can do whatever they want.\n\n2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:09.160\n So their money, sorry about that, to go, hey, I'm going to put this out and I'm going\n\n2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:14.720\n to get the best physicists that are working at CERN, that are at MIT, that are at Caltech,\n\n2:28:14.720 --> 2:28:15.720\n at the schools I mentioned.\n\n2:28:15.720 --> 2:28:20.080\n And, oh, by the way, a few of these guys are propulsion experts and I'm going to basically,\n\n2:28:20.080 --> 2:28:23.440\n I'm going to fund you guys for 10 years.\n\n2:28:23.440 --> 2:28:26.840\n So you get $10 million a year and I'm going to give you your salaries and we're going\n\n2:28:26.840 --> 2:28:28.160\n to do that or whatever the amount works.\n\n2:28:28.160 --> 2:28:30.960\n So let's cut it down to five so we can pay you well, right?\n\n2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:31.960\n To do the research.\n\n2:28:31.960 --> 2:28:36.640\n But, oh, by the way, the research is, it's not classified, but it's controlled.\n\n2:28:36.640 --> 2:28:40.760\n So we're not going to publicly just put this out in journals, but if we make a leap that\n\n2:28:40.760 --> 2:28:45.060\n we think would advance because although those, let's say there's 10 of them, those 10 scientists\n\n2:28:45.060 --> 2:28:49.560\n come up with something and they put out a paper, there might be a number 11 at another\n\n2:28:49.560 --> 2:28:54.240\n university that reads that paper and says, hey, I kind of had this idea and now you can\n\n2:28:54.240 --> 2:28:59.280\n get a thought pool that pushes us in and gets us out of the mindset.\n\n2:28:59.280 --> 2:29:04.560\n Because we have a tendency to, we evolve the stuff that we create, but it's like I was\n\n2:29:04.560 --> 2:29:09.320\n joking because I know a ton of guys with PhDs and girls.\n\n2:29:09.320 --> 2:29:13.360\n And I said, but how much, when a person gets a PhD in engineering, how much new math is\n\n2:29:13.360 --> 2:29:14.360\n really being done?\n\n2:29:14.360 --> 2:29:18.720\n I said, there's a handful of people in the world that are really doing, I'm talking Stephen\n\n2:29:18.720 --> 2:29:26.000\n Hawkins type brilliance that is going, I'm really doing something that's totally different.\n\n2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:30.800\n That's a big dramatic thing now going on in physics that everybody's converged towards\n\n2:29:30.800 --> 2:29:34.320\n this local minima or local maxima, whatever you think about it.\n\n2:29:34.320 --> 2:29:44.200\n And it's again, same as with the TICTAC, thinking outside the box is not accepted and it probably\n\n2:29:44.200 --> 2:29:45.200\n should be.\n\n2:29:45.200 --> 2:29:51.720\n But it's hard because if you go back, go back to Einstein, back to the original, he was\n\n2:29:51.720 --> 2:29:53.080\n out of the box.\n\n2:29:53.080 --> 2:29:54.080\n He did not think the norm.\n\n2:29:54.080 --> 2:29:55.080\n That's true genius.\n\n2:29:55.080 --> 2:29:59.140\n Had he not thought out of the box and came up with some of his theories, where would\n\n2:29:59.140 --> 2:30:00.140\n we be?\n\n2:30:00.140 --> 2:30:03.080\n Okay, we're jumping around a little bit.\n\n2:30:03.080 --> 2:30:09.720\n So we've talked a little bit about Elon and Mars and space, but let me jump back to a\n\n2:30:09.720 --> 2:30:11.840\n few questions that folks had.\n\n2:30:11.840 --> 2:30:17.800\n I have to kind of bring up some debunking stuff because I think not the actual facts\n\n2:30:17.800 --> 2:30:25.040\n of the debunking, but the nature of the true believers versus the debunkers hurts my heart\n\n2:30:25.040 --> 2:30:29.120\n a little bit because people are just talking past each other, but let me kind of bring\n\n2:30:29.120 --> 2:30:30.120\n it up.\n\n2:30:30.120 --> 2:30:36.560\n Mick West, I've just recently started to pay attention just in preparing to talk to you\n\n2:30:36.560 --> 2:30:37.560\n about this world.\n\n2:30:37.560 --> 2:30:44.120\n And Mick West is one of the better known people who kind of makes a career out of trying to\n\n2:30:44.120 --> 2:30:45.120\n debunk.\n\n2:30:45.120 --> 2:30:50.360\n Sort of his natural approach to all situations is that of a skeptic.\n\n2:30:50.360 --> 2:30:55.120\n I think it's very useful and powerful, especially for me coming from a scientific perspective\n\n2:30:55.120 --> 2:30:57.200\n to take the approach he does.\n\n2:30:57.200 --> 2:30:58.200\n It's valuable.\n\n2:30:58.200 --> 2:31:04.760\n And I think no matter what, I think there's, I hope that people, quote unquote, true believers\n\n2:31:04.760 --> 2:31:07.960\n are a little bit more open minded to the work of Mick West.\n\n2:31:07.960 --> 2:31:11.120\n I think it's quite useful and brilliant work.\n\n2:31:11.120 --> 2:31:17.320\n So let me ask, he has a bunch of videos, a bunch of ideas where he kind of suggests possible\n\n2:31:17.320 --> 2:31:21.020\n other explanations of the things that were out there.\n\n2:31:21.020 --> 2:31:27.880\n He has some explanations of the things that you've seen in with the Tic Tac, like with\n\n2:31:27.880 --> 2:31:28.880\n your own eyes.\n\n2:31:28.880 --> 2:31:36.200\n He says that it's possible that you miscalculated the size and the distance of the thing and\n\n2:31:36.200 --> 2:31:37.720\n so on when you were flying around.\n\n2:31:37.720 --> 2:31:41.520\n I don't find that as, I mean, maybe you can comment on that.\n\n2:31:41.520 --> 2:31:42.520\n Let me do it right now.\n\n2:31:42.520 --> 2:31:43.520\n Sure.\n\n2:31:43.520 --> 2:31:44.520\n So, cause that comes up.\n\n2:31:44.520 --> 2:31:45.840\n Like how, how did you know it was about 40 feet long?\n\n2:31:45.840 --> 2:31:53.120\n I go, okay, so 16 years flying against other airplanes, know what stuff looks like.\n\n2:31:53.120 --> 2:31:54.860\n You know, I've looked down on things.\n\n2:31:54.860 --> 2:31:56.560\n So if I know, I know, here's the known things.\n\n2:31:56.560 --> 2:32:02.120\n I know when we saw the Tic Tac, I was at 20,000 feet ish, right around there.\n\n2:32:02.120 --> 2:32:05.260\n So when I look down, I know what a Hornet looks like looking down on them cause I've\n\n2:32:05.260 --> 2:32:07.200\n done it for all those years.\n\n2:32:07.200 --> 2:32:08.440\n I mean, I got a good idea.\n\n2:32:08.440 --> 2:32:11.880\n So that's, that's why I said 40 feet cause it's about Hornet size.\n\n2:32:11.880 --> 2:32:15.760\n So and as I go around, you know, you get to the point where you have to be able to judge\n\n2:32:15.760 --> 2:32:21.720\n distance when we fly out of experience and you can tell if something small or big, you\n\n2:32:21.720 --> 2:32:23.600\n know.\n\n2:32:23.600 --> 2:32:30.120\n So I would argue the fact of, you know, peer experiences, you know, professional observers,\n\n2:32:30.120 --> 2:32:33.800\n which is what we're actually trained to do.\n\n2:32:33.800 --> 2:32:38.160\n And having done it for so long, no, it was, and everyone came back with the same thing.\n\n2:32:38.160 --> 2:32:40.320\n They're like, yeah, it's about size of Hornet.\n\n2:32:40.320 --> 2:32:46.720\n From a human factors perspective, how often in your experience of those 16 years do you\n\n2:32:46.720 --> 2:32:53.000\n find that eyes, what you see is the incorrect state of things.\n\n2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:57.840\n So like how often do you make mistakes with vision?\n\n2:32:57.840 --> 2:33:02.240\n You actually, you make vision issues a lot because you're, and the sad part is, is your\n\n2:33:02.240 --> 2:33:04.820\n brain believes what your eyes see.\n\n2:33:04.820 --> 2:33:08.760\n We are actually trained to do the opposite of that, especially when you instrument fly\n\n2:33:08.760 --> 2:33:14.880\n because your brain and eyes can tell you one thing, but you got to trust your instruments.\n\n2:33:14.880 --> 2:33:16.260\n Let's go back to landing at night.\n\n2:33:16.260 --> 2:33:22.980\n So your eyes assume that the runway and your brain assumes that\n\n2:33:22.980 --> 2:33:26.800\n the runway is fixed, but you know that the runway is moving.\n\n2:33:26.800 --> 2:33:31.960\n So if I try and do stuff visually, I would, you die every time, not every time, but you\n\n2:33:31.960 --> 2:33:34.600\n die close to every time trying to land on a boat.\n\n2:33:34.600 --> 2:33:37.800\n So we actually use instruments, which are counter to your brain.\n\n2:33:37.800 --> 2:33:41.160\n So, and there's actually all kinds of things that we go through in training.\n\n2:33:41.160 --> 2:33:43.780\n They have this thing, I think they still use it.\n\n2:33:43.780 --> 2:33:51.000\n It's called the MSDD multi spatial disorientation device or the spin and puke.\n\n2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.720\n It looks like a giant carousel and you're in these little modules.\n\n2:33:53.720 --> 2:33:57.360\n And when you get out, you think the thing goes really fast and they can, you can make\n\n2:33:57.360 --> 2:34:01.360\n yourself think that I'm descending or climbing, but we were actually only going around in\n\n2:34:01.360 --> 2:34:04.160\n circles at a very slow rate, as fast as a human can talk.\n\n2:34:04.160 --> 2:34:08.360\n But as they spin you around in a little sub thing and slow it down and speed it up, your\n\n2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:12.520\n body does this and you, you know, and then by visuals of showing you like they can spin\n\n2:34:12.520 --> 2:34:16.640\n it sideways to the outside wall, but they can show like lines that are, they can make\n\n2:34:16.640 --> 2:34:18.440\n the line stand still because they're moving the same velocity.\n\n2:34:18.440 --> 2:34:20.680\n They can move the other way and you'll think you're screaming.\n\n2:34:20.680 --> 2:34:23.960\n You see it in amusement parks all the time.\n\n2:34:23.960 --> 2:34:28.440\n You do all that because it gives you a sense of the A, but you're really not doing, you're\n\n2:34:28.440 --> 2:34:29.440\n sitting there.\n\n2:34:29.440 --> 2:34:30.440\n So we get trained on all that stuff.\n\n2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:33.480\n So if you, if you want to look at it and go, well, you're, you're disoriented or this,\n\n2:34:33.480 --> 2:34:35.440\n I'd be like, I'd argue going, no, I'm not.\n\n2:34:35.440 --> 2:34:39.000\n Because you know, when I'm flying the airplane, even as I'm looking at the Tic Tac, I've got\n\n2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:42.420\n a heads up display that tells me what my airplane's doing.\n\n2:34:42.420 --> 2:34:44.680\n So I've got, I know what I'm doing.\n\n2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:45.680\n I can look outside.\n\n2:34:45.680 --> 2:34:49.040\n I've got a sense of what I'm doing, but I'm also looking inside to cross check of what\n\n2:34:49.040 --> 2:34:51.240\n I'm seeing is in reality, what I'm doing.\n\n2:34:51.240 --> 2:34:56.460\n You actually, your brain gotten good at combining almost adding extra sensory information.\n\n2:34:56.460 --> 2:35:01.000\n You have to, you have like supervision, so you're combining what you're seeing and adjusting\n\n2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:04.480\n what the sensors, what you call an instruments are giving you.\n\n2:35:04.480 --> 2:35:10.600\n And that, that in turn is a loop that adjusts the perception system that like, that, that\n\n2:35:10.600 --> 2:35:13.400\n adjusts your brain's interpretation of what you're saying.\n\n2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:15.860\n You'd be amazed at how good, so here's a, here's another example.\n\n2:35:15.860 --> 2:35:20.960\n So if we go out over the water, so there's no land in sight and we're going to fight.\n\n2:35:20.960 --> 2:35:25.340\n So when we fight, you know, two airplanes, we're going to dog fight.\n\n2:35:25.340 --> 2:35:30.440\n As an instructor and I was for all, most of my time, you have to come back and you have\n\n2:35:30.440 --> 2:35:31.520\n to recreate it.\n\n2:35:31.520 --> 2:35:33.720\n So we call it drawing arrows.\n\n2:35:33.720 --> 2:35:37.360\n So you have to recreate that stuff.\n\n2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:41.040\n So you get pretty good at going, you know, like I would take off and say, all right,\n\n2:35:41.040 --> 2:35:47.020\n we're starting heading due east and I know where the sun is at because in the short couple\n\n2:35:47.020 --> 2:35:49.160\n minutes that we're going to fight, the sun's really not going to move much.\n\n2:35:49.160 --> 2:35:50.160\n It's going to be in a relative zone.\n\n2:35:50.160 --> 2:35:56.740\n I know that the sun is at, you know, let's just say 195 degrees, right?\n\n2:35:56.740 --> 2:36:00.800\n So I'm starting going east and it's actually be down off my right hand side.\n\n2:36:00.800 --> 2:36:03.280\n So now I know as I'm fighting, cause in the water you don't have any reference.\n\n2:36:03.280 --> 2:36:04.280\n Like I pass land.\n\n2:36:04.280 --> 2:36:05.280\n I pass land.\n\n2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:06.280\n No, you don't.\n\n2:36:06.280 --> 2:36:07.280\n And you can't use clouds cause clouds do move.\n\n2:36:07.280 --> 2:36:09.560\n But you got to come back cause you go, here's where I started.\n\n2:36:09.560 --> 2:36:14.280\n And then you, when, as soon as you end, you go, all right, I ended heading 355.\n\n2:36:14.280 --> 2:36:18.280\n And then you recreate the turns and the amount of turns and use the sun relative.\n\n2:36:18.280 --> 2:36:22.440\n So you can create this entire battle that went on with arrows so that you can come back\n\n2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:27.000\n and debrief the guy that you were teaching on exactly what happened.\n\n2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:28.840\n And you get really, really good at that.\n\n2:36:28.840 --> 2:36:31.240\n So when you come up and go, well, Dave, how do you know you were at six oclock?\n\n2:36:31.240 --> 2:36:32.800\n And he went around and he came up here.\n\n2:36:32.800 --> 2:36:36.200\n I go, because I'm trained to do all that.\n\n2:36:36.200 --> 2:36:39.000\n And I take all the notes, why I'm flying, you can do it.\n\n2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:42.960\n But usually it's, you memorize it all and you get done and then you, as soon as you're\n\n2:36:42.960 --> 2:36:45.480\n done, you knock it off, you look at the other airplane, you get set and you start writing\n\n2:36:45.480 --> 2:36:46.480\n all your notes down.\n\n2:36:46.480 --> 2:36:47.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:36:47.480 --> 2:36:50.040\n And you're writing it really fast on your card and you go out with a stack of cards\n\n2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:52.360\n and you stick the new one on your knee board card so you're ready to go and here's the\n\n2:36:52.360 --> 2:36:53.360\n next setup.\n\n2:36:53.360 --> 2:37:00.440\n It's kind of, it's in some way similar to what like at the, at the highest level chess\n\n2:37:00.440 --> 2:37:01.440\n players do.\n\n2:37:01.440 --> 2:37:07.960\n I mean, you're, I mean, they, they, they recap the games.\n\n2:37:07.960 --> 2:37:13.720\n But the, the richness of the representation that they use in remembering like how the\n\n2:37:13.720 --> 2:37:15.240\n games evolved.\n\n2:37:15.240 --> 2:37:19.640\n It's not like it's much richer than the actual moves.\n\n2:37:19.640 --> 2:37:24.680\n It's like these, a bunch of patterns that are hard to put into words, like, like all\n\n2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:30.200\n the richness of thinking they have about the way the game evolved.\n\n2:37:30.200 --> 2:37:34.220\n It's more like instinctual from years and years of experience.\n\n2:37:34.220 --> 2:37:37.240\n So they try to put it into words, but they really can't.\n\n2:37:37.240 --> 2:37:38.240\n It's just.\n\n2:37:38.240 --> 2:37:39.240\n I understand that.\n\n2:37:39.240 --> 2:37:42.560\n It's because for us, if we don't come back with anything, then there's no learning to\n\n2:37:42.560 --> 2:37:43.560\n be had.\n\n2:37:43.560 --> 2:37:44.560\n Right.\n\n2:37:44.560 --> 2:37:47.100\n Because the whole thing is the debrief when we get back and we talk about, that's really\n\n2:37:47.100 --> 2:37:49.100\n where the learning is.\n\n2:37:49.100 --> 2:37:52.600\n And it's the same thing if you want to go back to chess, you know, when you start off,\n\n2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:55.100\n you try and learn because you're remembering what you're doing.\n\n2:37:55.100 --> 2:37:59.100\n If you play against someone, I'm always a big place, play with someone better than you.\n\n2:37:59.100 --> 2:38:00.100\n That's how you learn.\n\n2:38:00.100 --> 2:38:01.600\n If you're constantly beating people, you're not learning anything.\n\n2:38:01.600 --> 2:38:04.120\n You're just learning that they're not good and you're better.\n\n2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:10.080\n When you challenge yourself against someone that is better than you, you learn.\n\n2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:15.760\n So I learned how to fight an airplane with, he's actually one of my best friends, we'll\n\n2:38:15.760 --> 2:38:16.760\n call him Tom.\n\n2:38:16.760 --> 2:38:19.280\n I won't give his call sign because I don't know what his name is.\n\n2:38:19.280 --> 2:38:23.960\n So Tom took me out and taught me how to fight because Tom had just left Top Gun.\n\n2:38:23.960 --> 2:38:28.720\n He was the training officer at Top Gun, which so that's the guy, the training officer is\n\n2:38:28.720 --> 2:38:30.960\n the main guy at Top Gun.\n\n2:38:30.960 --> 2:38:32.440\n So Tom was the training officer at Top Gun.\n\n2:38:32.440 --> 2:38:36.480\n So Tom, when I learned, because I had come out of A6 and we really don't fight because\n\n2:38:36.480 --> 2:38:37.960\n it was a bomber.\n\n2:38:37.960 --> 2:38:40.800\n So I get in F18s and I want to learn how to fight because it's a whole other side of the\n\n2:38:40.800 --> 2:38:41.800\n mission.\n\n2:38:41.800 --> 2:38:42.800\n It's the F and F fighter attack.\n\n2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:44.500\n The F18 is fighter attack.\n\n2:38:44.500 --> 2:38:46.400\n So I had to learn how to fight.\n\n2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:49.760\n So now I got one of the best fighter pilots in the world who's going to teach me how to\n\n2:38:49.760 --> 2:38:51.520\n do it.\n\n2:38:51.520 --> 2:38:52.520\n And he did.\n\n2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:56.080\n And I would do something and then he would go, I'd get to a situation where I had never\n\n2:38:56.080 --> 2:38:57.080\n been.\n\n2:38:57.080 --> 2:38:58.080\n And then I would go, well, I'm going to do this.\n\n2:38:58.080 --> 2:39:02.400\n And then he would destroy me and he would come back and go, here's why you don't do\n\n2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:03.400\n that.\n\n2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:06.960\n And then I would take that knowledge and I would put it in my little basket of tricks.\n\n2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:09.880\n And over time, because you don't, no one walks out into that world.\n\n2:39:09.880 --> 2:39:13.960\n I don't care how gifted of an aviator and go, I am the man or the woman.\n\n2:39:13.960 --> 2:39:14.960\n I am it.\n\n2:39:14.960 --> 2:39:17.560\n No, it's a learning process.\n\n2:39:17.560 --> 2:39:22.560\n And so over all those years, you've gotten good.\n\n2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:29.560\n So what are the chances that your eyes betrays you when you saw the Tic Tac?\n\n2:39:29.560 --> 2:39:30.560\n Low.\n\n2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:31.560\n Zero.\n\n2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:34.280\n Well, I mean, I'm not zero.\n\n2:39:34.280 --> 2:39:35.280\n So maybe 90.\n\n2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:37.920\n Yeah, I am ninety nine point nine percent.\n\n2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:39.200\n So point one percent.\n\n2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:40.320\n My eyes deceive me.\n\n2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:43.720\n But remember, if it deceived me, it had to deceive the other four people.\n\n2:39:43.720 --> 2:39:45.480\n So the percentage is even lower.\n\n2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:46.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:39:46.480 --> 2:39:47.480\n Look up.\n\n2:39:47.480 --> 2:39:51.200\n Well, I don't find that particular debunking case that you said, but I'm glad you put it.\n\n2:39:51.200 --> 2:39:55.000\n You you said those words out loud.\n\n2:39:55.000 --> 2:40:00.320\n So for me, from my perspective, coming into this world and looking at it, I'm a little\n\n2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:03.040\n bit more skeptical.\n\n2:40:03.040 --> 2:40:06.120\n So your eye account, I think, is the most fascinating story.\n\n2:40:06.120 --> 2:40:12.920\n And that I think that's inspiring to me and should be inspiring to a lot of scientists\n\n2:40:12.920 --> 2:40:19.020\n out there on so many levels, just like we said, an engineering level that maybe there's\n\n2:40:19.020 --> 2:40:24.860\n propulsion systems we can actually build that can do some crazy, amazing stuff.\n\n2:40:24.860 --> 2:40:30.000\n So it's at the very least intriguing and at the best inspiring.\n\n2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:31.000\n I just want to say that.\n\n2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:43.800\n But on the video side, it's like it's the videos for the Flir video, the go fast and\n\n2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:45.720\n the gimbal video.\n\n2:40:45.720 --> 2:40:53.080\n They are only interesting to me to me in the context of your story.\n\n2:40:53.080 --> 2:40:56.800\n Like without that, they're kind of low resolution.\n\n2:40:56.800 --> 2:41:02.760\n It's like it it's easier to build a debunking story to be skeptical.\n\n2:41:02.760 --> 2:41:04.320\n So this is where I'm coming from.\n\n2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:06.040\n Maybe you can convince me otherwise.\n\n2:41:06.040 --> 2:41:12.740\n But so to bring up Mick West one more time, he looks at the Flir video and he says that\n\n2:41:12.740 --> 2:41:17.940\n one of the most amazing video parts of the Flir video for people haven't seen it is at\n\n2:41:17.940 --> 2:41:31.360\n the end of it, the Tic Tac flies or appears to fly very quickly to the left off the screen.\n\n2:41:31.360 --> 2:41:39.280\n And what Mick West says is that, you know, Mick West, probably others, that the way to\n\n2:41:39.280 --> 2:41:42.880\n explain that is the tracking system.\n\n2:41:42.880 --> 2:41:48.680\n Like we said, this vision based tracking simply loses the like the object.\n\n2:41:48.680 --> 2:41:50.760\n The tracking loses it.\n\n2:41:50.760 --> 2:41:57.160\n And so it simply allows the object to float off screen because it's no longer tracking\n\n2:41:57.160 --> 2:41:58.160\n it.\n\n2:41:58.160 --> 2:42:04.640\n So I find that at least a plausible explanation of that video.\n\n2:42:04.640 --> 2:42:07.440\n Looking at your face, you do not.\n\n2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:12.500\n So can you maybe comment to that to that debunking aspect?\n\n2:42:12.500 --> 2:42:18.240\n So it's funny how people can extrapolate stuff who've never operated the system.\n\n2:42:18.240 --> 2:42:19.240\n No, for sure.\n\n2:42:19.240 --> 2:42:22.680\n And that's like me going because I'm a big Formula One fan.\n\n2:42:22.680 --> 2:42:25.680\n You know, that's like me going, oh, my God, Lewis, what were you doing?\n\n2:42:25.680 --> 2:42:27.720\n You could have done this with the car and you'd have won the race.\n\n2:42:27.720 --> 2:42:30.880\n You know, and Lewis Hamilton right now is, you know, defending world champion two time\n\n2:42:30.880 --> 2:42:33.600\n ways, four time, four or five time world champion.\n\n2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:39.600\n But that would be pretty stupid of me to try and tell Lewis Hamilton how to drive a car.\n\n2:42:39.600 --> 2:42:43.220\n Or a matter of fact, anyone driving a Formula One car.\n\n2:42:43.220 --> 2:42:45.080\n So I can't tell you how many times I've watched.\n\n2:42:45.080 --> 2:42:49.160\n You got to remember when we looked at this thing, when when Chad came back with the video,\n\n2:42:49.160 --> 2:42:50.160\n we sat there and watched that.\n\n2:42:50.160 --> 2:42:53.120\n I mean, I can't tell you how many times I watched it off the original tapes going, all\n\n2:42:53.120 --> 2:42:54.120\n right, right.\n\n2:42:54.120 --> 2:42:55.120\n All right.\n\n2:42:55.120 --> 2:42:58.360\n Let's look at this, you know, because you can look and see where the you can see where\n\n2:42:58.360 --> 2:42:59.360\n the airplane's going.\n\n2:42:59.360 --> 2:43:00.720\n You can see if it's looking left or right.\n\n2:43:00.720 --> 2:43:02.640\n And if you actually watch all that stuff, it doesn't do that.\n\n2:43:02.640 --> 2:43:07.080\n It actually when the vehicle starts to move, the bars, the tracking gate starts to open\n\n2:43:07.080 --> 2:43:11.000\n up and the people at Raytheon could probably add to this because they built the pod.\n\n2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:12.920\n The tracking gate will start to open up.\n\n2:43:12.920 --> 2:43:17.460\n And but the thing when it leaves so fast off the screen, the pod can't move fast enough.\n\n2:43:17.460 --> 2:43:20.840\n It has gimbal rates on how fast that thing can move around because there's another theory\n\n2:43:20.840 --> 2:43:24.880\n that, oh, the pods looking forward when the pod passes underneath the airplane.\n\n2:43:24.880 --> 2:43:28.100\n So if I'm looking at you and you pass underneath me as it does this, the ball will actually\n\n2:43:28.100 --> 2:43:33.520\n flip around to kind of finish off and it'll it'll it swaps ends because it has, you know,\n\n2:43:33.520 --> 2:43:34.520\n it's a gimbal.\n\n2:43:34.520 --> 2:43:38.080\n It can't just it's not free floating.\n\n2:43:38.080 --> 2:43:39.080\n But there's a theory on one of them.\n\n2:43:39.080 --> 2:43:40.080\n Oh, it's here and it flipped over.\n\n2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:41.600\n It doesn't do that when it's looking out in front.\n\n2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:43.100\n It stays like this.\n\n2:43:43.100 --> 2:43:45.960\n So yet another another debunker who doesn't know this.\n\n2:43:45.960 --> 2:43:50.540\n So, you know, and Mick has had several theories on other of some of the other videos like\n\n2:43:50.540 --> 2:43:53.040\n one of them, the go fast as a bird.\n\n2:43:53.040 --> 2:43:57.860\n And Jeremy Corbell actually did a nice job of saying, no, it's not because he's on he's\n\n2:43:57.860 --> 2:43:58.860\n on black hot.\n\n2:43:58.860 --> 2:44:02.560\n So the white object is actually colder than the ocean.\n\n2:44:02.560 --> 2:44:03.560\n That's fine.\n\n2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:05.800\n If they were colder than the ocean, they'd be dead.\n\n2:44:05.800 --> 2:44:13.440\n So the gimbal video to comment on the amazing aspect of that video is the rotation, the\n\n2:44:13.440 --> 2:44:15.160\n apparent rotation of the object.\n\n2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:22.880\n That is something that is not possible to do with systems that we know of.\n\n2:44:22.880 --> 2:44:30.560\n And Mick West suggests that a flare like reflections or whatever can explain.\n\n2:44:30.560 --> 2:44:36.360\n Now, because what Mick West doesn't see is so when they take because I've talked to the\n\n2:44:36.360 --> 2:44:37.760\n one of them, actually, I work with.\n\n2:44:37.760 --> 2:44:38.760\n So I know him.\n\n2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:40.800\n I know I talk to him all the time.\n\n2:44:40.800 --> 2:44:46.000\n So and it's his best friend actually shot the video, one of his best friends for the\n\n2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:50.880\n video, the movie and both of them that go fast in the game were shot by the same person.\n\n2:44:50.880 --> 2:44:51.880\n Yeah.\n\n2:44:51.880 --> 2:44:54.060\n OK, so and they were in each other's wedding.\n\n2:44:54.060 --> 2:44:55.520\n So that's how well they know each other.\n\n2:44:55.520 --> 2:44:58.640\n OK, so what you don't see is.\n\n2:44:58.640 --> 2:45:03.840\n So the airplanes, airplanes still super hornets, but they have the APG 79, which is the new\n\n2:45:03.840 --> 2:45:08.460\n phased array radar that's made by Raytheon, things incredible, OK?\n\n2:45:08.460 --> 2:45:11.480\n It doesn't usually if it's if it's out there and it sees it, it's real.\n\n2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:13.960\n So at first they thought they were ghost tracks when they started seeing stuff.\n\n2:45:13.960 --> 2:45:16.120\n And then they actually threw one of the targeting pods out there.\n\n2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:19.520\n Well, the targeting pod, there's heat signature and you go, hey, dot heat signature, something's\n\n2:45:19.520 --> 2:45:20.520\n there.\n\n2:45:20.520 --> 2:45:21.520\n It's real.\n\n2:45:21.520 --> 2:45:22.760\n It's not you're not picking up some extraneous thing.\n\n2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:27.400\n So what you see in the gimbal video of the thing and it rotates and you go, holy shit,\n\n2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:28.400\n look at that thing.\n\n2:45:28.400 --> 2:45:32.200\n And it's in the wind and it's going against the wind while it's doing this.\n\n2:45:32.200 --> 2:45:33.480\n You know, someone goes, oh, it's an airplane.\n\n2:45:33.480 --> 2:45:36.520\n No, if an airplane does this, it's eventually going to start to change aspect because it's\n\n2:45:36.520 --> 2:45:37.520\n in a turn.\n\n2:45:37.520 --> 2:45:38.520\n This thing doesn't change aspect.\n\n2:45:38.520 --> 2:45:39.520\n It just rotates.\n\n2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:40.520\n It's just rotating.\n\n2:45:40.520 --> 2:45:41.520\n Right.\n\n2:45:41.520 --> 2:45:44.840\n The other thing that you see when you talk to them is so they're on their radar.\n\n2:45:44.840 --> 2:45:51.800\n There's an object that they identify is their number one priority or their launch and steering.\n\n2:45:51.800 --> 2:45:54.560\n So when they designate that, that's where the targeting pod is going to look.\n\n2:45:54.560 --> 2:45:56.480\n That's what you get on the gimbal video.\n\n2:45:56.480 --> 2:45:58.360\n There's five other I think it's five.\n\n2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:02.040\n They're kind of in a V, you know, like a geese would fly that are out in front of it and\n\n2:46:02.040 --> 2:46:03.400\n they're actually coming.\n\n2:46:03.400 --> 2:46:06.680\n They're out in front of it and they actually turn on the radar and go the other way while\n\n2:46:06.680 --> 2:46:13.240\n they're filming the gimbal video, which it's I know Ryan has come out and talked about\n\n2:46:13.240 --> 2:46:14.680\n it.\n\n2:46:14.680 --> 2:46:19.280\n But when you see it, you go, you know, if you take it in context because you go, oh,\n\n2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:20.280\n it's just the video.\n\n2:46:20.280 --> 2:46:23.280\n Well, if you take the video with the radar going, no, there's actually other things out\n\n2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:29.440\n there because there's at least 60 people that have seen these things on radar off the VACAPES.\n\n2:46:29.440 --> 2:46:33.520\n It actually became, I called a buddy of mine who was running the wing at the time, the\n\n2:46:33.520 --> 2:46:34.520\n fighter wing.\n\n2:46:34.520 --> 2:46:35.920\n I said, dude, what are you guys doing about this?\n\n2:46:35.920 --> 2:46:38.900\n He goes, well, we got a NOTAM out, which is a notice to airmen, which means there's these\n\n2:46:38.900 --> 2:46:41.800\n objects out there in the warning area.\n\n2:46:41.800 --> 2:46:44.160\n So anyone, you can fly a Cessna through the warning area.\n\n2:46:44.160 --> 2:46:47.420\n All the warning area tells you is that there's high military traffic and training out here.\n\n2:46:47.420 --> 2:46:52.440\n It's probably best not to be here, but there's nothing that prohibits you from going in there.\n\n2:46:52.440 --> 2:46:56.560\n So these things have the right, wherever they're from or whatever they are, you know, cause\n\n2:46:56.560 --> 2:46:57.800\n people are like, oh, they're balloons.\n\n2:46:57.800 --> 2:46:59.400\n Well, balloons float.\n\n2:46:59.400 --> 2:47:02.960\n Balloons don't sit in 70 knots of wind and stay in the same location.\n\n2:47:02.960 --> 2:47:05.340\n They had an airplane because there was two.\n\n2:47:05.340 --> 2:47:06.340\n There's the gimbal thing.\n\n2:47:06.340 --> 2:47:08.240\n That's a pretty big object.\n\n2:47:08.240 --> 2:47:11.480\n There's also, they talk about, it looks like a cube that's inside of a sphere.\n\n2:47:11.480 --> 2:47:12.480\n A translucent sphere.\n\n2:47:12.480 --> 2:47:13.480\n What the hell is that?\n\n2:47:13.480 --> 2:47:16.120\n And they almost hit one.\n\n2:47:16.120 --> 2:47:17.420\n It's almost hit them.\n\n2:47:17.420 --> 2:47:21.440\n So that's another, that's one of the biggest, another biggest account.\n\n2:47:21.440 --> 2:47:27.560\n It's like almost hit a plane, something that appeared to be a cube in a translucent sphere.\n\n2:47:27.560 --> 2:47:30.560\n What do you make of that?\n\n2:47:30.560 --> 2:47:36.040\n Again, you know, what, I mean, that that's, that's the most dangerous thing.\n\n2:47:36.040 --> 2:47:37.040\n You're right.\n\n2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:40.120\n The biggest frustration is when you do that and you go, okay, so this thing passed between\n\n2:47:40.120 --> 2:47:43.680\n two airplanes and it was, I think it was more than like a hundred feet or something like\n\n2:47:43.680 --> 2:47:45.640\n that of the airplane that almost hit it.\n\n2:47:45.640 --> 2:47:48.600\n So what they do is they come back and go, Hey, I had a near midair, what'd you have\n\n2:47:48.600 --> 2:47:49.600\n a near midair with?\n\n2:47:49.600 --> 2:47:52.120\n It's kind of this floating beach ball with this cube inside of it.\n\n2:47:52.120 --> 2:47:53.120\n And you go, huh?\n\n2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:57.200\n And you know, so they send out a NOTAM again and they, they do a, what's called a hazard\n\n2:47:57.200 --> 2:47:59.120\n report that says, Hey, there's these objects out there.\n\n2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:04.920\n We almost hit one here and that gets sent off to the Naval safety center.\n\n2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:05.920\n What was done?\n\n2:48:05.920 --> 2:48:06.920\n I mean, what are you going to do?\n\n2:48:06.920 --> 2:48:10.400\n Can you catch one, go out with a giant net and try and bag one?\n\n2:48:10.400 --> 2:48:11.480\n You don't know because they've seen them.\n\n2:48:11.480 --> 2:48:13.280\n They picked them up like hovering on radar.\n\n2:48:13.280 --> 2:48:15.680\n And then all of a sudden they're traveling at really high rates of speed.\n\n2:48:15.680 --> 2:48:18.600\n So you know, what are you going to do?\n\n2:48:18.600 --> 2:48:25.040\n Well, and that, let me ask this, cause this is what people kind of think about.\n\n2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:30.880\n After you witnessed Tic Tac and after this, these incidents, as far as we know, uh, with\n\n2:48:30.880 --> 2:48:39.640\n the gimbal and the go fast, it seems like people in the military did not, did not react\n\n2:48:39.640 --> 2:48:43.220\n like what, like did not freak out.\n\n2:48:43.220 --> 2:48:46.620\n It almost like was like a mundane event.\n\n2:48:46.620 --> 2:48:47.720\n How do you explain that?\n\n2:48:47.720 --> 2:48:53.520\n Why didn't the people on the ship, not the higher ups, why wasn't there a big freakout?\n\n2:48:53.520 --> 2:48:58.560\n Or as some people suggest, the higher ups knew about it all along and just were not\n\n2:48:58.560 --> 2:49:05.560\n letting everyone know that there's some kind of secret military, uh, uh, you know, like,\n\n2:49:05.560 --> 2:49:06.560\n like tests.\n\n2:49:06.560 --> 2:49:07.560\n Yeah.\n\n2:49:07.560 --> 2:49:11.200\n So let's talk about, so let's say you've got this cool new toy, which you call it a cool\n\n2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:12.200\n new toy.\n\n2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:15.640\n You typically don't take your cool new toy out into an area where the cool new toy could\n\n2:49:15.640 --> 2:49:19.880\n get damaged or what if the airplane would have actually hit your cool new toy and you\n\n2:49:19.880 --> 2:49:23.900\n got two people that are ejecting or dead and you got a, you know, $80 million airplane\n\n2:49:23.900 --> 2:49:29.840\n that's now in the bottom of the Atlantic, um, you know, tests are normally done in controlled\n\n2:49:29.840 --> 2:49:30.840\n environments.\n\n2:49:30.840 --> 2:49:32.720\n Just, it's like any test, a lab test or whatever.\n\n2:49:32.720 --> 2:49:36.540\n When you take things out into the real world, you know, you're still going to test it in\n\n2:49:36.540 --> 2:49:38.280\n an area where if something goes wrong.\n\n2:49:38.280 --> 2:49:41.000\n So when they started and we'll go back to Elon.\n\n2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:45.760\n So my friend that worked there, they had a rocket go off, they were out in Kwajalein\n\n2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:50.480\n and when the rocket went up, a fuel line ruptured in the rocket and it ran out of fuel before\n\n2:49:50.480 --> 2:49:53.040\n it got all the way up and it came falling back down.\n\n2:49:53.040 --> 2:49:58.120\n Well, when you're out on an ATOL in the Pacific, if it's going up above you, the worst case\n\n2:49:58.120 --> 2:49:59.340\n is going to land on you.\n\n2:49:59.340 --> 2:50:02.800\n So you're worried about where else is it going to land and it actually crashed next to the\n\n2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:08.360\n ATOL and, and, you know, Elon wasn't happy and threw this guy under the bus.\n\n2:50:08.360 --> 2:50:12.780\n So that's a test environment because you don't know what's going to happen.\n\n2:50:12.780 --> 2:50:15.780\n So cause someone said, well, when we chased the Tic Tac, well, it could have been some\n\n2:50:15.780 --> 2:50:16.780\n secret government thing.\n\n2:50:16.780 --> 2:50:21.000\n Well, secret government things typically just don't come out and test to where there's going\n\n2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:22.000\n to be.\n\n2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:24.320\n Unknowing pilots, you can't control a lot of things.\n\n2:50:24.320 --> 2:50:25.320\n You're exactly right.\n\n2:50:25.320 --> 2:50:29.680\n So you go, you know, it's, you know, it's not the Dr. Evil scientist that's going to\n\n2:50:29.680 --> 2:50:34.860\n throw shit out there to get, there's control and there's reasons that we do it because\n\n2:50:34.860 --> 2:50:39.840\n a lot of stuff, especially when you get to there's, there's, you build something in theory,\n\n2:50:39.840 --> 2:50:43.120\n you model it, you go, Hey, this is, it looks like it's going to work.\n\n2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:47.840\n You get funding, you build it, you test it some more, you bench test it.\n\n2:50:47.840 --> 2:50:51.680\n You know, you like an airplane with digital flight controls before it even leaves the\n\n2:50:51.680 --> 2:50:52.680\n ground.\n\n2:50:52.680 --> 2:50:56.540\n They've got things over the pedostatic system that are changing the, what the airplane thinks\n\n2:50:56.540 --> 2:50:59.280\n is the airspeed talking to it and it's probably up on Jack.\n\n2:50:59.280 --> 2:51:02.320\n So the gear up, so it doesn't, it thinks it's flying.\n\n2:51:02.320 --> 2:51:04.800\n It doesn't know it's sitting on Jack stands.\n\n2:51:04.800 --> 2:51:07.680\n And they're just changing the pressure on the pedostatic system so they can actually\n\n2:51:07.680 --> 2:51:11.280\n make the flight controls move and they can get all the data back to go, Hey, it looks\n\n2:51:11.280 --> 2:51:12.560\n like it's going to work.\n\n2:51:12.560 --> 2:51:15.040\n And then there's wind, there's a bunch of stuff that they do.\n\n2:51:15.040 --> 2:51:17.120\n That's a control environment which you can do the testing.\n\n2:51:17.120 --> 2:51:18.120\n Yeah.\n\n2:51:18.120 --> 2:51:23.600\n Throwing shit out in the middle of where people are doing exercises is the most preposterous\n\n2:51:23.600 --> 2:51:25.400\n thing that I've heard.\n\n2:51:25.400 --> 2:51:26.400\n Is it possible?\n\n2:51:26.400 --> 2:51:27.400\n Yes.\n\n2:51:27.400 --> 2:51:33.020\n Is it more really, is it, is it, is it, is it more likely, it's more likely they're not\n\n2:51:33.020 --> 2:51:34.020\n doing that.\n\n2:51:34.020 --> 2:51:40.720\n Then the other side of that question is why do you think people on the Nimitz and in the\n\n2:51:40.720 --> 2:51:45.920\n US government in general, not freak out more at the incredible thing that you've seen?\n\n2:51:45.920 --> 2:51:48.880\n Freak out in the positive way, freak out in the negative way.\n\n2:51:48.880 --> 2:51:51.440\n Like what are the Russians up to again?\n\n2:51:51.440 --> 2:51:53.760\n Or more like what is this?\n\n2:51:53.760 --> 2:51:55.800\n Like more turmoil.\n\n2:51:55.800 --> 2:52:00.200\n So if you would have put a Chinese flag on the side of it or a Russian flag on the side\n\n2:52:00.200 --> 2:52:03.440\n of it, and I said, yeah, it had a big Russian flag on the side of it, dude.\n\n2:52:03.440 --> 2:52:04.960\n Then it would have got a lot of attention.\n\n2:52:04.960 --> 2:52:06.660\n It would have went high order, right?\n\n2:52:06.660 --> 2:52:11.060\n If it was, you don't have to say Russia or China, just say if there was another country's\n\n2:52:11.060 --> 2:52:16.100\n emblem on the side of this thing that we saw and said, oh, it belonged to them, then it's\n\n2:52:16.100 --> 2:52:17.820\n a big deal.\n\n2:52:17.820 --> 2:52:18.820\n So here's what's going on.\n\n2:52:18.820 --> 2:52:21.600\n So we're literally in the middle of workups and it was a joint workup.\n\n2:52:21.600 --> 2:52:24.360\n Normally they, we go out for a month, go come back, do stuff, go out for a month.\n\n2:52:24.360 --> 2:52:27.920\n This was a two month at sea period where we actually had to beg for them to let us when\n\n2:52:27.920 --> 2:52:31.680\n the ship pulled in at Thanksgiving so we could run home up to the central valley, have Thanksgiving\n\n2:52:31.680 --> 2:52:34.380\n with our family, and then run back down and do this, okay?\n\n2:52:34.380 --> 2:52:40.780\n So when I had just taken over, I had had the squadron for a month, right?\n\n2:52:40.780 --> 2:52:46.300\n So I'm a brand new CO, I'm the most junior guy on the, as far as a commanding officer\n\n2:52:46.300 --> 2:52:51.400\n goes, for time in the Navy, and actually at the time I think it was the most junior CO\n\n2:52:51.400 --> 2:52:53.760\n for O5 Command in the Navy, right?\n\n2:52:53.760 --> 2:52:59.520\n So you go, okay, so I'm out here, I got my squadron, I'm running it, I see this thing,\n\n2:52:59.520 --> 2:53:00.640\n we catch shit for it.\n\n2:53:00.640 --> 2:53:02.160\n I have a squadron to run.\n\n2:53:02.160 --> 2:53:08.760\n I have the, the TICTAC was over here and although an extraordinary event, I have 17 aircrew\n\n2:53:08.760 --> 2:53:12.680\n and 300 sailors that I'm responsible for, right?\n\n2:53:12.680 --> 2:53:17.080\n Their wellbeing, making sure they're fed, making sure they're happy, they're birthing,\n\n2:53:17.080 --> 2:53:22.160\n you know, and I'm working with my Master Chief and I'm working with my XO, SNAP, and we're\n\n2:53:22.160 --> 2:53:23.800\n going through all this stuff.\n\n2:53:23.800 --> 2:53:28.440\n I don't have a lot of time to worry about the TICTAC.\n\n2:53:28.440 --> 2:53:32.560\n But people need to talk to me, so you got to remember, you got the captain of the ship,\n\n2:53:32.560 --> 2:53:35.000\n you got the air wing commander, and you got the Admiral.\n\n2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:36.000\n Those are the top three.\n\n2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:40.800\n And you got the CO of the Princeton, who is a major command guy, and that's really your\n\n2:53:40.800 --> 2:53:41.800\n big major command.\n\n2:53:41.800 --> 2:53:45.260\n And then everything else is you got all the squadrons, which are O5 Command, and you got\n\n2:53:45.260 --> 2:53:47.220\n the small boys that are out there, which is O5 Command.\n\n2:53:47.220 --> 2:53:53.280\n So in the hierarchy, as far as rank and responsibility of what's going on, I'm pretty much in the\n\n2:53:53.280 --> 2:53:59.120\n top 20 with all my peers, and then I've got, obviously, the captain and the admiral, right?\n\n2:53:59.120 --> 2:54:02.560\n And then he's got some post command guys on his staff that we were friends with.\n\n2:54:02.560 --> 2:54:04.880\n So you're responsible for a lot of things.\n\n2:54:04.880 --> 2:54:05.880\n Yes.\n\n2:54:05.880 --> 2:54:06.880\n Oh, yeah.\n\n2:54:06.880 --> 2:54:07.880\n Busy schedule.\n\n2:54:07.880 --> 2:54:08.880\n Yeah.\n\n2:54:08.880 --> 2:54:09.880\n There's missions.\n\n2:54:09.880 --> 2:54:13.880\n You have to do a lot, get the job done, and there's no time for silly things.\n\n2:54:13.880 --> 2:54:14.880\n That's exactly right.\n\n2:54:14.880 --> 2:54:20.200\n So, and we're the integration, you know, when a battle group deploys, especially when you\n\n2:54:20.200 --> 2:54:24.320\n go to the Middle East for what we were doing, the air power is the key.\n\n2:54:24.320 --> 2:54:28.380\n We take our airport with us, we can park it anywhere we want, and we can do what we need\n\n2:54:28.380 --> 2:54:29.640\n to do.\n\n2:54:29.640 --> 2:54:30.720\n So we're kind of key players.\n\n2:54:30.720 --> 2:54:33.780\n So when you get the theory that, oh, all these men in suits showed up.\n\n2:54:33.780 --> 2:54:37.360\n So the captain of the ship never said anything to me, the admiral never saying to me, the\n\n2:54:37.360 --> 2:54:40.960\n people on his staff that I was friends with never saying to me, the other COs that I talked\n\n2:54:40.960 --> 2:54:44.520\n to on a daily basis never said anything to me, and no one ever came and talked to me,\n\n2:54:44.520 --> 2:54:45.600\n and I'm the guy that chased it.\n\n2:54:45.600 --> 2:54:48.880\n So in all the theories and all the debunkers and all the stories, because I don't know\n\n2:54:48.880 --> 2:54:52.160\n if people think they're going to get rich on this because I made a big donut on this.\n\n2:54:52.160 --> 2:54:53.280\n I can tell you what I got paid for.\n\n2:54:53.280 --> 2:54:57.440\n I got paid to go out and spend 21 hours of my day going to LA and do a five minute talk\n\n2:54:57.440 --> 2:54:58.440\n for someone.\n\n2:54:58.440 --> 2:55:00.920\n And I'm like, and it wasn't for the talk because I'll talk for free because you're not paying\n\n2:55:00.920 --> 2:55:01.920\n me.\n\n2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:08.040\n I said, and then I got paid to go to the McMinnville Fest because my wife and I got to go because\n\n2:55:08.040 --> 2:55:10.800\n it was just looked like fun because the whole town gets involved.\n\n2:55:10.800 --> 2:55:14.760\n And it's the only time I've ever spoken publicly in front of a large audience about this because\n\n2:55:14.760 --> 2:55:16.120\n it was just, you know, it was fun.\n\n2:55:16.120 --> 2:55:18.760\n And I got asked and Jeremy and George Knappen went the year before.\n\n2:55:18.760 --> 2:55:21.080\n So I went with Bob Lazar.\n\n2:55:21.080 --> 2:55:24.560\n So I got to hang out with Bob and his wife and his wife and my wife and, you know, we\n\n2:55:24.560 --> 2:55:28.520\n all hung out kind of, you know, talking not about UFO stuff, but just getting to know\n\n2:55:28.520 --> 2:55:33.760\n each other as people because, you know, Bob's like me, the stuff that he talks about is\n\n2:55:33.760 --> 2:55:34.760\n not the center of his life.\n\n2:55:34.760 --> 2:55:40.180\n If anything, it ruined his life, you know, he's just a really, really smart guy.\n\n2:55:40.180 --> 2:55:42.800\n That's just like the rest of us trying to get through life.\n\n2:55:42.800 --> 2:55:50.400\n Yeah, nevertheless, I mean, that was one of the sad things reading Lou Elizondo's resignation\n\n2:55:50.400 --> 2:55:59.400\n note from his, he was a program director at the ATIP program.\n\n2:55:59.400 --> 2:56:04.080\n One of the sad things is that he's mentioned that, you know, people in government just\n\n2:56:04.080 --> 2:56:10.600\n don't take this seriously as a threat, like UFOs as a threat, like you said, if it doesn't\n\n2:56:10.600 --> 2:56:17.120\n have a Russian label on it, it's a sad thing to think about that, that we have such a busy\n\n2:56:17.120 --> 2:56:25.280\n schedule that the anomaly, it doesn't, is a distraction that we don't want to deal with\n\n2:56:25.280 --> 2:56:29.200\n and it kind of just fades into history.\n\n2:56:29.200 --> 2:56:38.880\n Like literally, it's kind of sad to think that if aliens showed up, like, and it just\n\n2:56:38.880 --> 2:56:44.880\n didn't because they're not, like when aliens show up, they're not going to be a thing that's\n\n2:56:44.880 --> 2:56:50.960\n on the schedule and if they don't start killing people, they just kind of show up in some\n\n2:56:50.960 --> 2:56:57.680\n very nonchalant peaceful way briefly.\n\n2:56:57.680 --> 2:57:02.480\n People would be like, that's, I don't have time for this.\n\n2:57:02.480 --> 2:57:03.480\n That's so sad.\n\n2:57:03.480 --> 2:57:04.480\n That's so sad.\n\n2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:05.480\n It's like anywhere in the world.\n\n2:57:05.480 --> 2:57:11.600\n So, you know, go back, let's go back way back, way back in the time machine, you know, there\n\n2:57:11.600 --> 2:57:16.000\n were people kind of scattered around the globe, you know, and Europe's a perfect example.\n\n2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:18.800\n Why does France speak French?\n\n2:57:18.800 --> 2:57:23.200\n And then right next to them, Spanish, you know, Spain speaks Spanish and then you'd\n\n2:57:23.200 --> 2:57:27.700\n kind of jump over and Germans are German and the Polish people, everyone speaks a different\n\n2:57:27.700 --> 2:57:31.840\n language because if you look at the way the train kind of subdivide the original people\n\n2:57:31.840 --> 2:57:37.600\n that were there, you know, thousands of years ago, they speak differently, right?\n\n2:57:37.600 --> 2:57:39.560\n You'd be like the US, but see, the US is different.\n\n2:57:39.560 --> 2:57:40.980\n We all speak English because what happened?\n\n2:57:40.980 --> 2:57:44.840\n We came over and we started on the east coast and we migrated west.\n\n2:57:44.840 --> 2:57:48.460\n We won't get into the, you know, what happened and, you know, because the Native Americans\n\n2:57:48.460 --> 2:57:52.400\n all spoke different languages, you know, it's that same type of thing.\n\n2:57:52.400 --> 2:57:56.880\n So, but anytime we have a tendency to show up, you're actually, you think about, you're\n\n2:57:56.880 --> 2:57:57.880\n an alien.\n\n2:57:57.880 --> 2:58:02.240\n If I went to a different area, if I just, you know, go back 500 years where, you know,\n\n2:58:02.240 --> 2:58:05.640\n or a thousand years where travel, we weren't traveling across oceans at the time.\n\n2:58:05.640 --> 2:58:10.680\n We were, well, we don't think we were, but the Vikings probably were because we had limited,\n\n2:58:10.680 --> 2:58:12.600\n you know, we had to have supplies and the boats weren't as big.\n\n2:58:12.600 --> 2:58:13.600\n We had to build them by hand.\n\n2:58:13.600 --> 2:58:15.040\n We didn't have power tools and all that stuff.\n\n2:58:15.040 --> 2:58:19.600\n So, you know, if you show up someplace like when the conquistadors from Spain came over\n\n2:58:19.600 --> 2:58:25.000\n into South America and you've got, you know, the natives, you're actually an alien, you\n\n2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:30.040\n know, and then you look at what typically happens when aliens show up in a human alien\n\n2:58:30.040 --> 2:58:33.800\n world, you know, and when I say alien, I mean, you are not from that area.\n\n2:58:33.800 --> 2:58:38.640\n The other, we take what we want.\n\n2:58:38.640 --> 2:58:39.640\n And that's what happened.\n\n2:58:39.640 --> 2:58:45.560\n I mean, we literally defuncted civilizations because that's how we are, you know, humans\n\n2:58:45.560 --> 2:58:48.000\n are, we're an interesting group.\n\n2:58:48.000 --> 2:58:49.880\n So you go, now what?\n\n2:58:49.880 --> 2:58:52.400\n What if something is from someplace else?\n\n2:58:52.400 --> 2:58:57.720\n Let's just, let's just go off the grid and go, let's say there are little green men.\n\n2:58:57.720 --> 2:58:58.720\n What are their intentions?\n\n2:58:58.720 --> 2:59:01.160\n Lou asked me this when we were talking to Lou Elizondo and he said, what do you think\n\n2:59:01.160 --> 2:59:02.160\n they were here for us?\n\n2:59:02.160 --> 2:59:03.160\n I said, I don't know.\n\n2:59:03.160 --> 2:59:04.160\n He goes, what?\n\n2:59:04.160 --> 2:59:05.160\n I go, I don't know.\n\n2:59:05.160 --> 2:59:06.160\n They were observing.\n\n2:59:06.160 --> 2:59:07.160\n They'd come down, they'd hang out.\n\n2:59:07.160 --> 2:59:08.720\n And he goes, well, what if they were prepping the battlefield?\n\n2:59:08.720 --> 2:59:10.880\n What if they were observing to figure out what we do?\n\n2:59:10.880 --> 2:59:12.760\n And you go, that's interesting.\n\n2:59:12.760 --> 2:59:16.920\n The other theory is maybe there's a more advanced civilization out here and they just check\n\n2:59:16.920 --> 2:59:21.780\n in on us because the threat to an advanced civilization is when a civilization that's\n\n2:59:21.780 --> 2:59:27.040\n inferior to them actually develops enough and fast enough to become equal or above.\n\n2:59:27.040 --> 2:59:29.160\n Because now these, they become the threatened type.\n\n2:59:29.160 --> 2:59:32.160\n So you watch us grow until we start getting too much.\n\n2:59:32.160 --> 2:59:34.440\n You know, it's kind of like you go, well, cause they always have a tendency to hang\n\n2:59:34.440 --> 2:59:35.440\n out around nuclear.\n\n2:59:35.440 --> 2:59:36.440\n Right?\n\n2:59:36.440 --> 2:59:39.540\n And you go, well, you know, if this is an advanced civilization, I'm going to go science\n\n2:59:39.540 --> 2:59:40.800\n fiction kind of comical.\n\n2:59:40.800 --> 2:59:45.840\n They come down and watch us and go, look at the, the crazy upright monkeys now have developed\n\n2:59:45.840 --> 2:59:46.840\n the atom bomb.\n\n2:59:46.840 --> 2:59:47.840\n Let's hope they don't destroy themselves.\n\n2:59:47.840 --> 2:59:52.120\n Yeah, if I was an alien civilization, I would start paying attention with the atom bomb.\n\n2:59:52.120 --> 3:00:00.880\n That's why the, I mean, there's certainly an uptick of, what is it, UFO sightings since,\n\n3:00:00.880 --> 3:00:03.400\n since the nuclear era, since the nuclear era.\n\n3:00:03.400 --> 3:00:04.400\n Yeah.\n\n3:00:04.400 --> 3:00:07.920\n You go, hmm.\n\n3:00:07.920 --> 3:00:13.240\n Let me ask a little bit out there question, maybe it's a speculation, but maybe touching\n\n3:00:13.240 --> 3:00:26.160\n on Roswell, do you think it's possible that there is out of this world aircraft or beings\n\n3:00:26.160 --> 3:00:32.800\n that are in the possession of one of the governments on this earth, like the US government?\n\n3:00:32.800 --> 3:00:34.560\n Is it possible?\n\n3:00:34.560 --> 3:00:40.840\n So the one perspective of that, if it's possible, is it possible to keep a secret like that?\n\n3:00:40.840 --> 3:00:41.840\n I would say this.\n\n3:00:41.840 --> 3:00:46.760\n I think it's very, it's highly possible because if you go, if you just look at all the sightings\n\n3:00:46.760 --> 3:00:51.000\n and let's go, just look at project Blue Book, it was what the, I forget how many thousands\n\n3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:55.780\n of sightings that there's a percentage, it's like 10 or 15% of them, they still can't explain.\n\n3:00:55.780 --> 3:00:58.320\n Like our Tic Tac is one of them that, you know, they basically, the government has come\n\n3:00:58.320 --> 3:00:59.920\n out and said, we don't know what that was.\n\n3:00:59.920 --> 3:01:00.920\n Okay.\n\n3:01:00.920 --> 3:01:05.020\n So, so if you go, okay, of that 15% that we don't know, and all of these thousands are\n\n3:01:05.020 --> 3:01:07.840\n still that 15% makes up a pretty big number.\n\n3:01:07.840 --> 3:01:13.840\n What are the chances that not one of them crashed somewhere on the globe and was recovered?\n\n3:01:13.840 --> 3:01:18.360\n And I don't care if it's an intact system or you've got pieces of it, of a metal that\n\n3:01:18.360 --> 3:01:27.840\n we can't explain or some, some biological matter to say the least, it could be intact\n\n3:01:27.840 --> 3:01:32.600\n or it couldn't, but the odds of that now are starting to go down that, you know, that could\n\n3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:33.600\n never happen.\n\n3:01:33.600 --> 3:01:36.440\n And I'm not talking just the United States, I'm talking the world.\n\n3:01:36.440 --> 3:01:40.880\n So is there a chance that a foreign government actually possesses or our government or someone\n\n3:01:40.880 --> 3:01:46.420\n in the, in the world on the globe of the seven plus billion people has something that is\n\n3:01:46.420 --> 3:01:47.420\n not from this world?\n\n3:01:47.420 --> 3:01:52.000\n And I'm not talking a meteor, but something that was manufactured in some way that allowed\n\n3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:54.620\n transport or observation.\n\n3:01:54.620 --> 3:01:57.740\n Could be a drone, could be a foreign drone, you know, like Voyager flies around and does\n\n3:01:57.740 --> 3:01:58.740\n all that stuff.\n\n3:01:58.740 --> 3:02:02.880\n And we've got stuff that just went past Pluto that's out in the Kuiper belt, you know, there's,\n\n3:02:02.880 --> 3:02:04.080\n there's stuff out there floating around.\n\n3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:07.560\n And what about ours, it's going to crash into Jupiter eventually or whatever, cause we've\n\n3:02:07.560 --> 3:02:09.640\n had stuff crash into planets.\n\n3:02:09.640 --> 3:02:14.400\n So if that's the case, you would think something is out there that we have something that we\n\n3:02:14.400 --> 3:02:15.400\n can't explain.\n\n3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:19.640\n And according to Lou, there's stuff that we can't explain, you know, and I would assume\n\n3:02:19.640 --> 3:02:25.920\n that Lou who ran a tip has, has seen stuff that he can't openly talk about because, you\n\n3:02:25.920 --> 3:02:27.840\n know, cause I had a clearance.\n\n3:02:27.840 --> 3:02:31.120\n When you have a clearance, you were, you sign your name, you're bound to that.\n\n3:02:31.120 --> 3:02:36.760\n And to me, that's an important oath that you hold to, you know, and this is kind of where,\n\n3:02:36.760 --> 3:02:39.320\n you know, people have issues with Bob.\n\n3:02:39.320 --> 3:02:42.520\n So if, you know, and I leave it to you to determine if you believe Bob or not.\n\n3:02:42.520 --> 3:02:47.400\n I'll tell you, Bob is a straightforward, very sane, normal, super smart guy.\n\n3:02:47.400 --> 3:02:48.400\n Bob Luzaro.\n\n3:02:48.400 --> 3:02:49.400\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:49.400 --> 3:02:50.400\n Yes.\n\n3:02:50.400 --> 3:02:53.600\n There is the other side that says, well, should he have come out and talked, you know, to\n\n3:02:53.600 --> 3:02:58.040\n those who will clearance who, you know, are true to the government, you would say he should\n\n3:02:58.040 --> 3:02:59.040\n have never spoke.\n\n3:02:59.040 --> 3:03:02.680\n He, he was under an oath to not say anything, but he did.\n\n3:03:02.680 --> 3:03:05.240\n If you ask Bob, why did you say something?\n\n3:03:05.240 --> 3:03:10.780\n His, his answer was, I understand there's an oath, but I felt that the technology could\n\n3:03:10.780 --> 3:03:14.000\n benefit all of mankind and it shouldn't be locked away.\n\n3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:15.000\n And I'll leave it.\n\n3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:17.440\n If you believe Bob, that's, that's kind of what Bob says.\n\n3:03:17.440 --> 3:03:21.360\n And that, that's such a interesting key point.\n\n3:03:21.360 --> 3:03:28.100\n If there is aircraft, a technology that's in the possession of the, say the US government,\n\n3:03:28.100 --> 3:03:30.720\n should they make that publicly known?\n\n3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:37.820\n This is the question of like, do we release stuff that can potentially change the nature\n\n3:03:37.820 --> 3:03:39.360\n of human civilization?\n\n3:03:39.360 --> 3:03:47.840\n Like the, the way we, the way we think about our place in the world, also the, if that\n\n3:03:47.840 --> 3:03:55.340\n technology is potentially useful for military applications, the nature of military conflict,\n\n3:03:55.340 --> 3:03:58.560\n should we release that information or not, if you were the government?\n\n3:03:58.560 --> 3:04:00.160\n So here, well, here's exactly how.\n\n3:04:00.160 --> 3:04:05.560\n So for, for classified information, the government is the people that classify it.\n\n3:04:05.560 --> 3:04:09.920\n So I can't go, I can't look at something and go, Oh my God, this Avion bottle is now a\n\n3:04:09.920 --> 3:04:10.920\n top secret.\n\n3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:13.000\n I can't, I don't have the authority, the ability or anyone to do that.\n\n3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:14.000\n That's the guard.\n\n3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:15.000\n That's up to the government.\n\n3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:17.600\n And I agree with that because I worked for the government for 24 years of my life.\n\n3:04:17.600 --> 3:04:21.460\n So I understand that.\n\n3:04:21.460 --> 3:04:24.840\n But now you go, there's reasons stuff is classified.\n\n3:04:24.840 --> 3:04:25.840\n Okay.\n\n3:04:25.840 --> 3:04:31.440\n And it has to do with, uh, sometimes information is classified by how it was obtained.\n\n3:04:31.440 --> 3:04:32.760\n It's just like the mob.\n\n3:04:32.760 --> 3:04:36.840\n If I have a spy and I'm a mobster and you're the counter mobster, but I have a guy on the\n\n3:04:36.840 --> 3:04:39.680\n inside that's feeding me information, I can't do it.\n\n3:04:39.680 --> 3:04:44.280\n And a perfect example is if you've ever seen the, uh, it's the Tom Cruise movie, what is\n\n3:04:44.280 --> 3:04:45.280\n it?\n\n3:04:45.280 --> 3:04:48.960\n Air America or whatever, but he, he plays the guy in Louisiana who was hauling drugs\n\n3:04:48.960 --> 3:04:53.720\n for Pablo Escobar and he ended up getting a cargo plane and the government, the CIA\n\n3:04:53.720 --> 3:04:56.080\n was kind of funding him to do stuff.\n\n3:04:56.080 --> 3:04:58.840\n That's how he got hooked up with Pablo, but they put cameras on his airplane and when\n\n3:04:58.840 --> 3:05:03.220\n Reagan had come out and said, here's pictures, we have proof that they're running these drugs.\n\n3:05:03.220 --> 3:05:06.600\n It didn't take Pablo long to figure out those pictures were taken from inside of the plane\n\n3:05:06.600 --> 3:05:09.240\n of this guy he had been working with and that guy ends up dead.\n\n3:05:09.240 --> 3:05:10.800\n Does that make sense?\n\n3:05:10.800 --> 3:05:15.840\n So you classify to protect the source, you classify to protect the technology because\n\n3:05:15.840 --> 3:05:20.180\n if the technology would get out, it could be grave damage or there's levels depending\n\n3:05:20.180 --> 3:05:22.200\n on if it's a secret or top secret.\n\n3:05:22.200 --> 3:05:25.720\n There are levels of damage that can be done to the U S government and our wellbeing as\n\n3:05:25.720 --> 3:05:26.880\n a country.\n\n3:05:26.880 --> 3:05:29.560\n And we owe it to this because we're all Americans.\n\n3:05:29.560 --> 3:05:33.320\n You know, to me, no matter what some people will say, even in this country, this is the\n\n3:05:33.320 --> 3:05:35.360\n greatest country on the planet.\n\n3:05:35.360 --> 3:05:38.920\n This is the only country that you have the ability to do what you want to do.\n\n3:05:38.920 --> 3:05:40.260\n It's just, don't be lazy.\n\n3:05:40.260 --> 3:05:46.180\n And I have stories of people that came over here and started with nothing and they're,\n\n3:05:46.180 --> 3:05:49.720\n they're living the American dream and they'll tell you, and they didn't get it because of,\n\n3:05:49.720 --> 3:05:56.440\n you know, like you, you came over here from Russia, you get no minority status or anything\n\n3:05:56.440 --> 3:05:57.440\n else.\n\n3:05:57.440 --> 3:06:03.680\n You get, you're a white Anglo Saxton Protestant, whatever your religion, but you come over\n\n3:06:03.680 --> 3:06:04.680\n here.\n\n3:06:04.680 --> 3:06:09.240\n I kind of knew that from the last, but, um, but you come over here, you basically have\n\n3:06:09.240 --> 3:06:15.200\n made yourself, you're educated, you're working at literally the top research university in\n\n3:06:15.200 --> 3:06:16.280\n the world.\n\n3:06:16.280 --> 3:06:21.920\n To be honest, um, I can do whatever the hell I can create a, with a bit of, with a lot\n\n3:06:21.920 --> 3:06:25.120\n of hard work, I can do quite a, and no one gave it to you.\n\n3:06:25.120 --> 3:06:32.240\n So, I mean, and I, well, I'm a believer that like that, I mean, we are a community.\n\n3:06:32.240 --> 3:06:38.120\n So like there is a social aspect to it, but the freedom and the American dream is a real\n\n3:06:38.120 --> 3:06:39.120\n thing.\n\n3:06:39.120 --> 3:06:43.680\n And this is this, I, you know, I joke about being Russian, but I, I'm an American and\n\n3:06:43.680 --> 3:06:46.280\n this is, I do believe the greatest country on earth.\n\n3:06:46.280 --> 3:06:52.640\n So there's a reason the nationalist pride, uh, the pride in your nation is a powerful\n\n3:06:52.640 --> 3:06:53.640\n thing.\n\n3:06:53.640 --> 3:06:58.180\n And around that, this secrecy holds value.\n\n3:06:58.180 --> 3:07:03.600\n But to me, alien technology is bigger than that.\n\n3:07:03.600 --> 3:07:11.440\n I mean, it's, it's not so much a threat as a, you're holding back something that could\n\n3:07:11.440 --> 3:07:15.120\n inspire the world, like human knowledge.\n\n3:07:15.120 --> 3:07:16.400\n So let's talk in theory.\n\n3:07:16.400 --> 3:07:20.320\n So I'm going to go back to Bob cause I've talked to Bob.\n\n3:07:20.320 --> 3:07:23.920\n So Bob is a propulsion guy, right?\n\n3:07:23.920 --> 3:07:24.920\n Right.\n\n3:07:24.920 --> 3:07:26.200\n Bob has a bicycle with a rocket motor.\n\n3:07:26.200 --> 3:07:29.440\n He built a rocket car, you know, so he did that.\n\n3:07:29.440 --> 3:07:34.900\n So if you are trying to figure out a propulsion system, let's just say this is, I'm just talking,\n\n3:07:34.900 --> 3:07:36.940\n this is Dave's theory.\n\n3:07:36.940 --> 3:07:44.800\n I am, I own, I have, I have custody of this thing from a technology that I don't understand.\n\n3:07:44.800 --> 3:07:46.820\n And I know it's a propulsion system.\n\n3:07:46.820 --> 3:07:49.380\n So now I got to figure it out, right?\n\n3:07:49.380 --> 3:07:51.580\n So who are you going to go to, right?\n\n3:07:51.580 --> 3:07:52.580\n You go find someone.\n\n3:07:52.580 --> 3:07:57.440\n So you go, wait, here's a guy who at the time was working at Los Alamos, which they have\n\n3:07:57.440 --> 3:08:00.100\n proven who is big into propulsion.\n\n3:08:00.100 --> 3:08:01.100\n He designs all this.\n\n3:08:01.100 --> 3:08:05.120\n He builds a shit in his garage, Hey, he's super smart.\n\n3:08:05.120 --> 3:08:06.720\n Why don't we bring him in?\n\n3:08:06.720 --> 3:08:09.720\n So you hire him on a contract and you go, Hey, we're going to brief you into a program.\n\n3:08:09.720 --> 3:08:12.680\n And he goes and works on wherever he says he worked, you know, that's not important,\n\n3:08:12.680 --> 3:08:15.820\n but you get access to the technology to try and figure it out.\n\n3:08:15.820 --> 3:08:19.460\n And then you go, well, you know, Bob comes out and says, you know, like we're figuring\n\n3:08:19.460 --> 3:08:22.600\n out these things, but there's a part where our technology isn't advanced enough for us\n\n3:08:22.600 --> 3:08:25.380\n to figure the whole thing out.\n\n3:08:25.380 --> 3:08:29.640\n So then, you know, and let's just say Bob doesn't come out and tell anyone he works\n\n3:08:29.640 --> 3:08:33.520\n on it until he gets to the point where he's stagnated.\n\n3:08:33.520 --> 3:08:34.740\n He's at a, he's at a wall.\n\n3:08:34.740 --> 3:08:35.740\n You go, I can't do it.\n\n3:08:35.740 --> 3:08:37.580\n You know, sometimes the best thing is to bring in a fresh mind.\n\n3:08:37.580 --> 3:08:40.520\n So you go find someone else who's into propulsion, you bring him in and they work, they can't\n\n3:08:40.520 --> 3:08:41.520\n figure it out.\n\n3:08:41.520 --> 3:08:44.560\n Or they get to the point where kind of back to the Einstein theory where, Hey, I've got\n\n3:08:44.560 --> 3:08:46.960\n all these theories on how it works, but we don't have the technology.\n\n3:08:46.960 --> 3:08:49.220\n We haven't advanced enough to actually do what we need to do.\n\n3:08:49.220 --> 3:08:51.280\n We still have to advance technology more.\n\n3:08:51.280 --> 3:08:52.280\n So then what do you do?\n\n3:08:52.280 --> 3:08:57.280\n You shelf it, you go, Hey, good projects over and the contract, you shelf it and you wait\n\n3:08:57.280 --> 3:09:02.440\n another 10 years and you wait another 10 years until technology and our abilities and our\n\n3:09:02.440 --> 3:09:06.720\n research advances more and then you go find new people to bring in that are experts in\n\n3:09:06.720 --> 3:09:09.640\n that field and go, Hey, we want you to work on this thing and here's what we know about\n\n3:09:09.640 --> 3:09:10.960\n it so far.\n\n3:09:10.960 --> 3:09:15.600\n Or you don't tell them anything because you, cause remember if you, if you reveal someone\n\n3:09:15.600 --> 3:09:17.600\n else's research, you can taint their beliefs.\n\n3:09:17.600 --> 3:09:18.920\n They'll start to sway in that direction.\n\n3:09:18.920 --> 3:09:20.920\n So you go, I'm not going to tell you anything.\n\n3:09:20.920 --> 3:09:23.200\n I'm going to give you this thing and now you tell me what you think.\n\n3:09:23.200 --> 3:09:27.140\n And as they progress, if they get stuck on a problem that maybe Bob and someone else\n\n3:09:27.140 --> 3:09:28.940\n solved earlier, you can go, Hey, what about this?\n\n3:09:28.940 --> 3:09:30.260\n You don't have to tell them where it came from.\n\n3:09:30.260 --> 3:09:31.260\n What about this?\n\n3:09:31.260 --> 3:09:35.880\n You can leapfrog and they get another two steps closer to the final answer.\n\n3:09:35.880 --> 3:09:39.320\n And then we get stuck by our evolution of technology and you shelve it again.\n\n3:09:39.320 --> 3:09:41.540\n Do you think that's the right way to do it?\n\n3:09:41.540 --> 3:09:42.540\n Because it's heartbreaking.\n\n3:09:42.540 --> 3:09:48.840\n I don't, listen, I love government, but we just had this discussion about Elon and so\n\n3:09:48.840 --> 3:09:49.840\n on.\n\n3:09:49.840 --> 3:09:56.680\n The, the alternative approach is to release this to the world and say, there's a mystery\n\n3:09:56.680 --> 3:09:57.680\n here.\n\n3:09:57.680 --> 3:10:00.880\n And then the Elons of the world, the Jeff Bezos, we talked about money, but it's also\n\n3:10:00.880 --> 3:10:01.920\n not just money.\n\n3:10:01.920 --> 3:10:08.680\n It's like this engine that's within, we talked about the American dream to say, I'm going\n\n3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:11.800\n to be the one that cracks this mystery open.\n\n3:10:11.800 --> 3:10:17.940\n And like, that's within a lot of us and like money aside, people in their garage just will.\n\n3:10:17.940 --> 3:10:19.400\n But you're thinking like a scientist.\n\n3:10:19.400 --> 3:10:22.340\n Now let me, now let's shift to, let me think like a country.\n\n3:10:22.340 --> 3:10:26.480\n So we have country A, B, and C, and you can look at the nuclear arms race.\n\n3:10:26.480 --> 3:10:28.940\n So we know that Germany was really close.\n\n3:10:28.940 --> 3:10:31.040\n We know that Russia was getting pretty close.\n\n3:10:31.040 --> 3:10:34.680\n We just won the race and we were the first ones with it.\n\n3:10:34.680 --> 3:10:35.680\n And still to this day.\n\n3:10:35.680 --> 3:10:36.880\n And Germany could have won.\n\n3:10:36.880 --> 3:10:38.200\n They could have won.\n\n3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:41.640\n They could have won, but someone was smart enough to not finish the equation when they\n\n3:10:41.640 --> 3:10:43.600\n knew they had the answer.\n\n3:10:43.600 --> 3:10:45.000\n It's literally what it comes down to.\n\n3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:49.920\n Someone was smart enough to realize if that, that got into the hands of the Nazis, that\n\n3:10:49.920 --> 3:10:51.880\n that would be the end.\n\n3:10:51.880 --> 3:10:56.280\n And that's, that's a tough call to do that, knowing that you have the answer and you can't\n\n3:10:56.280 --> 3:10:58.300\n solve the problem because it will go into the wrong end.\n\n3:10:58.300 --> 3:10:59.300\n And that's kind of the fear.\n\n3:10:59.300 --> 3:11:03.960\n When you look at this, you go, okay, so if we do this, if we put it out there, we've\n\n3:11:03.960 --> 3:11:06.040\n got this technology.\n\n3:11:06.040 --> 3:11:09.080\n If we don't work on it kind of international space station, like we're all going to work\n\n3:11:09.080 --> 3:11:15.120\n on it together in a, you know, like Antarctica is really supposed to be treaty free from\n\n3:11:15.120 --> 3:11:16.120\n any weapons or anything.\n\n3:11:16.120 --> 3:11:17.840\n And we're supposed to, you know, we've got the international thing down there.\n\n3:11:17.840 --> 3:11:19.200\n We're all going to work together.\n\n3:11:19.200 --> 3:11:24.600\n If you did it in a, in the confines of that and you could control the flow in and out,\n\n3:11:24.600 --> 3:11:27.720\n because what you don't want is the, someone stealing information and getting it back to\n\n3:11:27.720 --> 3:11:31.280\n where, and countries are notorious to do this, Hey, we're doing it internationally, but we're\n\n3:11:31.280 --> 3:11:36.000\n secretly doing it ourselves to see who can come up with a solution first.\n\n3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:40.680\n That's the problem because we have this inherent thing of power and technology like that is\n\n3:11:40.680 --> 3:11:41.680\n power.\n\n3:11:41.680 --> 3:11:46.120\n It would, it would literally change the game of the way the world operates and from not\n\n3:11:46.120 --> 3:11:52.160\n just a transportation or mankind, but from a military aspect, it's got huge, huge.\n\n3:11:52.160 --> 3:11:53.160\n Yeah.\n\n3:11:53.160 --> 3:11:54.160\n Yeah.\n\n3:11:54.160 --> 3:11:59.560\n I, so beautifully, beautifully presented and there's, I feel like there's a tension between\n\n3:11:59.560 --> 3:12:04.480\n those two places, the scientist view of the world and the national security view of the\n\n3:12:04.480 --> 3:12:05.480\n world.\n\n3:12:05.480 --> 3:12:12.240\n Let me, let me get to this kind of interesting point, which is a lot of conspiracy theorists\n\n3:12:12.240 --> 3:12:17.360\n kind of paint a picture of government as an exceptionally, as a hierarchical system that's\n\n3:12:17.360 --> 3:12:22.020\n exceptionally competent and good at hiding secrets.\n\n3:12:22.020 --> 3:12:26.720\n And then, I mean, I tend to not subscribe to almost any conspiracy theory, to the degree\n\n3:12:26.720 --> 3:12:34.200\n at least that the conspiracy theorists do, but the, there does seem to be, and I tend\n\n3:12:34.200 --> 3:12:41.340\n to think of government as unfortunately incompetent, at least the bureaucracy.\n\n3:12:41.340 --> 3:12:45.640\n It seems that the communication, like the three videos that were released and just the\n\n3:12:45.640 --> 3:12:54.400\n way of DOD in general talks about the things we've been talking about, it's just confused.\n\n3:12:54.400 --> 3:13:00.720\n There's contradictory, it's not inspiring, it's, it's suspicious.\n\n3:13:00.720 --> 3:13:03.880\n It's just not even the way they released the videos.\n\n3:13:03.880 --> 3:13:09.900\n You know, the Tic Tac, if presented correctly, could just inspire a generation of scientists.\n\n3:13:09.900 --> 3:13:15.640\n It's like at the, you know, us going to the moon and it's inspiring.\n\n3:13:15.640 --> 3:13:20.480\n I mean, it's incredible, you know, and, and the way it was released, it was suspicious.\n\n3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:27.560\n It was like low resolution video on a crappy website, like with some crappy documents.\n\n3:13:27.560 --> 3:13:29.880\n And I mean, why, what is it?\n\n3:13:29.880 --> 3:13:32.960\n I don't know how to ask this question, but can government do better?\n\n3:13:32.960 --> 3:13:38.040\n Why are they doing it this way in terms of communicating the things they do know to the\n\n3:13:38.040 --> 3:13:39.040\n public?\n\n3:13:39.040 --> 3:13:44.520\n I don't know how, especially in this topic, it's been hidden for so many years.\n\n3:13:44.520 --> 3:13:49.480\n And I don't think, cause I don't buy off on the conspiracy stuff, I just think that, you\n\n3:13:49.480 --> 3:13:53.960\n know, when it comes in, like I said, you know, the government has the right to classify stuff.\n\n3:13:53.960 --> 3:13:56.480\n They classify everything cause they don't know.\n\n3:13:56.480 --> 3:13:58.000\n You have something, you don't know what it is, you don't know.\n\n3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:01.880\n So we just go, well, it must be, it must be top secret and let's put it in a vault.\n\n3:14:01.880 --> 3:14:05.360\n You know, it's kind of like the Indiana Jones where they take the ark and they put it in,\n\n3:14:05.360 --> 3:14:08.200\n it's in the giant army warehouse.\n\n3:14:08.200 --> 3:14:10.700\n You know, we don't even know what we have.\n\n3:14:10.700 --> 3:14:15.440\n So, but I also believe that, you know, and I'll say this openly, I don't think that the\n\n3:14:15.440 --> 3:14:17.360\n American people need to know everything.\n\n3:14:17.360 --> 3:14:22.980\n I think there's a reason that stuff is classified for the protection of this country.\n\n3:14:22.980 --> 3:14:24.600\n And I totally believe in that.\n\n3:14:24.600 --> 3:14:29.360\n So, you know, I was joking with Joe when he was talking about the storm area 51.\n\n3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:33.760\n So I'm like, yeah, that's probably the worst idea you could possibly have is to just storm\n\n3:14:33.760 --> 3:14:35.680\n a military installation.\n\n3:14:35.680 --> 3:14:36.960\n It's just stupid.\n\n3:14:36.960 --> 3:14:40.520\n There are reasons, there are reasons that we have things that we don't just let out\n\n3:14:40.520 --> 3:14:41.520\n to the public.\n\n3:14:41.520 --> 3:14:46.880\n Because if we do, as soon as you do let someone know that you have something, they immediately\n\n3:14:46.880 --> 3:14:48.080\n try to counter it.\n\n3:14:48.080 --> 3:14:54.440\n And perfect example, the U.S. in the 60s developed a bomber, it was a Mach 3 compression lift\n\n3:14:54.440 --> 3:14:56.200\n bomber called the XB 70.\n\n3:14:56.200 --> 3:14:57.200\n Okay.\n\n3:14:57.200 --> 3:14:59.940\n There was three of them built, three of them ever built.\n\n3:14:59.940 --> 3:15:05.200\n It was a like 60,000 foot high, you know, Mach 3, it was an incredible airplane when\n\n3:15:05.200 --> 3:15:08.520\n you see it, and there's actually the last one remaining is in Dayton, Ohio at the museum.\n\n3:15:08.520 --> 3:15:11.760\n You know, it would go, the wingtips would fold on, it looks like a Concorde, but it's\n\n3:15:11.760 --> 3:15:15.480\n way faster.\n\n3:15:15.480 --> 3:15:20.800\n When that got out that we were developing it, the Soviet Union developed the MiG 25,\n\n3:15:20.800 --> 3:15:25.160\n literally a high altitude interceptor to counter that bomber.\n\n3:15:25.160 --> 3:15:29.680\n And they built an entire fleet of MiG 25s, right?\n\n3:15:29.680 --> 3:15:35.280\n We built three XB 70s and we scrapped the program, right?\n\n3:15:35.280 --> 3:15:40.440\n Because now you go, well, the technology is cool, we proved it, but now it becomes obsolete.\n\n3:15:40.440 --> 3:15:43.260\n So it's not even worth building a whole fleet of these things.\n\n3:15:43.260 --> 3:15:44.660\n You know, it's a chess game.\n\n3:15:44.660 --> 3:15:48.520\n We do something, they do something, we do something, they do something, and we do something\n\n3:15:48.520 --> 3:15:49.520\n and then they counter it.\n\n3:15:49.520 --> 3:15:51.360\n You got to figure out how to defeat it.\n\n3:15:51.360 --> 3:15:53.080\n So you go, oh, we'll build something.\n\n3:15:53.080 --> 3:15:58.880\n So the more we keep quiet, especially from a defense standpoint, the better.\n\n3:15:58.880 --> 3:16:01.200\n Actually, personally, I think we talk too much.\n\n3:16:01.200 --> 3:16:07.440\n And I think the military and the DOD is starting to see that we're too open.\n\n3:16:07.440 --> 3:16:10.120\n You announce, hey, we're building this because there's a budget line and we live in a free\n\n3:16:10.120 --> 3:16:16.820\n society, but you don't have to release all the specs and you don't have to put everything\n\n3:16:16.820 --> 3:16:18.000\n in open source.\n\n3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:21.400\n But that's a problem when we go to the universities.\n\n3:16:21.400 --> 3:16:24.880\n If we want to go do work with MIT and you want to partner with MIT and you're a defense\n\n3:16:24.880 --> 3:16:29.240\n company and you want to partner, you know, you guys have a rule that if you create it,\n\n3:16:29.240 --> 3:16:34.320\n then it can be open source because the university owns it and we are an institution of learning.\n\n3:16:34.320 --> 3:16:38.840\n Where the defense side might go, we don't really want that published in a paper in Scientific\n\n3:16:38.840 --> 3:16:39.840\n America.\n\n3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:40.840\n It's so heartbreaking.\n\n3:16:40.840 --> 3:16:47.240\n I talked to CTO of Lockheed, Keiko Jackson, and just Concord's.\n\n3:16:47.240 --> 3:16:54.040\n Some of the best, if not the best engineering and science, but engineering really ever is\n\n3:16:54.040 --> 3:17:01.080\n done in secrecy and it sucks because it's so inspiring and they can't talk about it.\n\n3:17:01.080 --> 3:17:03.320\n It is, but some of it's due to funding.\n\n3:17:03.320 --> 3:17:04.880\n The US government has deep pockets.\n\n3:17:04.880 --> 3:17:08.960\n You know, some of this new technology that you develop for an open source and lesson,\n\n3:17:08.960 --> 3:17:11.200\n this goes back to the original conversation.\n\n3:17:11.200 --> 3:17:15.520\n We now, there's enough money in the private sector that individuals control.\n\n3:17:15.520 --> 3:17:19.160\n Bezos, I'm not talking Amazon.\n\n3:17:19.160 --> 3:17:23.720\n I'm talking Jeff Bezos, a single individual worth over a hundred billion dollars.\n\n3:17:23.720 --> 3:17:25.280\n He has the ability to do stuff.\n\n3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:31.360\n I'll tell you what, the Gates Foundation with between Bill Gates and his wife and Warren\n\n3:17:31.360 --> 3:17:36.680\n Buffett and some of the other money, because I think Bezos's ex wife actually donated a\n\n3:17:36.680 --> 3:17:40.120\n huge chunk of her half into the Gates Foundation.\n\n3:17:40.120 --> 3:17:43.200\n What's the Gates Foundation worth these days?\n\n3:17:43.200 --> 3:17:46.760\n These are guys, brilliant, brilliant.\n\n3:17:46.760 --> 3:17:49.520\n Some of the greatest minds that we have to go, what are they doing?\n\n3:17:49.520 --> 3:17:52.520\n Because they have the ability to, it's a nonprofit, they can go, hey, I want to fund this.\n\n3:17:52.520 --> 3:17:53.800\n I want to fund this research.\n\n3:17:53.800 --> 3:17:56.000\n They can look beyond the conflict between nations.\n\n3:17:56.000 --> 3:17:59.720\n You can look beyond the conflict of having to have classification.\n\n3:17:59.720 --> 3:18:01.880\n You could do what you want.\n\n3:18:01.880 --> 3:18:10.540\n It's just like, we classify how to do the whole nuclear, how to create a critical mass.\n\n3:18:10.540 --> 3:18:13.640\n But there's really smart high school kids that have figured it out mathematically and\n\n3:18:13.640 --> 3:18:14.640\n they do their science project.\n\n3:18:14.640 --> 3:18:17.160\n And then the government comes in and says, hey, we got to classify your government because\n\n3:18:17.160 --> 3:18:20.600\n we just don't want this out in the public domain, which I understand.\n\n3:18:20.600 --> 3:18:23.640\n And they never stopped them from free thought and developing that.\n\n3:18:23.640 --> 3:18:26.240\n It's just, hey, we really don't want this out there.\n\n3:18:26.240 --> 3:18:27.240\n Okay.\n\n3:18:27.240 --> 3:18:28.240\n So I understand that.\n\n3:18:28.240 --> 3:18:29.240\n I totally understand that.\n\n3:18:29.240 --> 3:18:33.400\n But if Bill and Melinda want to do this and go, hey, we want to do this and they're going\n\n3:18:33.400 --> 3:18:36.760\n to work with Bezos and they're going to work with Elon and we're going to, I mean, you\n\n3:18:36.760 --> 3:18:37.760\n think about it.\n\n3:18:37.760 --> 3:18:41.080\n There's a significant amount of money that could be available to R&D and I'm not talking\n\n3:18:41.080 --> 3:18:45.040\n just science like this, I'm talking medical research and all this.\n\n3:18:45.040 --> 3:18:46.280\n But then you go, well, who gets it?\n\n3:18:46.280 --> 3:18:49.720\n Because now you're competing against the companies that actually do it.\n\n3:18:49.720 --> 3:18:52.000\n You go, is that, well, are they the greatest minds?\n\n3:18:52.000 --> 3:18:58.160\n I'd say, you know, we have a tendency to go, these are the best that we have.\n\n3:18:58.160 --> 3:19:00.760\n And I'd say, well, no, that's the best that we know we have.\n\n3:19:00.760 --> 3:19:03.080\n But there's probably people out there that don't want to work.\n\n3:19:03.080 --> 3:19:05.740\n There's brilliant minds that don't want to do anything with defense because they just\n\n3:19:05.740 --> 3:19:07.380\n disagree with what it does.\n\n3:19:07.380 --> 3:19:10.320\n So they go to another path, they can do something else.\n\n3:19:10.320 --> 3:19:17.080\n And in a sense, like the Elons of the world that Jeff Bezos actually in a certain sense\n\n3:19:17.080 --> 3:19:23.040\n much better than DOD at finding the brilliant, weird minds out there.\n\n3:19:23.040 --> 3:19:24.320\n Because they're not tied to the government.\n\n3:19:24.320 --> 3:19:28.840\n So when you work a government contract, the government writes, they tell you what they\n\n3:19:28.840 --> 3:19:33.640\n want and then they work with you on the requirements and they usually have an end in mean.\n\n3:19:33.640 --> 3:19:36.840\n You know, they have an idea that this is what I want it to be.\n\n3:19:36.840 --> 3:19:43.880\n Where if you go to like SpaceX, where, you know, they come up with, why don't we just\n\n3:19:43.880 --> 3:19:46.440\n land these things on a pad and reuse them?\n\n3:19:46.440 --> 3:19:49.680\n Well, if the government scientist, if you're on a government contract says, no, that's\n\n3:19:49.680 --> 3:19:50.680\n not the requirements.\n\n3:19:50.680 --> 3:19:51.680\n We're not paying for that.\n\n3:19:51.680 --> 3:19:52.680\n We want you to do this.\n\n3:19:52.680 --> 3:19:53.840\n You're kind of controlled.\n\n3:19:53.840 --> 3:19:57.000\n Or when Elon does it, his company, they can do whatever the hell they want to do because\n\n3:19:57.000 --> 3:19:58.620\n they have no bounds.\n\n3:19:58.620 --> 3:20:02.220\n The only bounds they have is the liability if it doesn't work and it lands on something.\n\n3:20:02.220 --> 3:20:03.220\n So what do you do?\n\n3:20:03.220 --> 3:20:04.220\n You go out to Kwajalein and you test it.\n\n3:20:04.220 --> 3:20:06.640\n And if it crashes and it lands in the ocean, hey, we clean it up.\n\n3:20:06.640 --> 3:20:07.640\n No big deal.\n\n3:20:07.640 --> 3:20:10.000\n We lost some money, but we'll move on.\n\n3:20:10.000 --> 3:20:13.960\n It's, you know, money makes the world go around contrary to what everyone thinks.\n\n3:20:13.960 --> 3:20:17.080\n But, you know, there's a lot of money that's sitting around that you can do a lot of really\n\n3:20:17.080 --> 3:20:18.080\n cool stuff with.\n\n3:20:18.080 --> 3:20:19.080\n And I don't know.\n\n3:20:19.080 --> 3:20:23.640\n I mean, I'll guarantee that, what is it, Blue Origin, isn't that Amazon?\n\n3:20:23.640 --> 3:20:26.520\n You know, that they're doing some cool stuff because they have funny.\n\n3:20:26.520 --> 3:20:30.940\n And I joke with the guy I know that worked at SpaceX and he was funny because they were\n\n3:20:30.940 --> 3:20:35.320\n building the first test thing and they were limited.\n\n3:20:35.320 --> 3:20:42.000\n And Elon found this like 400 acre thing, I think it's about 400 acres down by Waco, Texas.\n\n3:20:42.000 --> 3:20:46.840\n And he's like, I go, how, he goes, dude, I worked, he goes, I worked with, he goes, because\n\n3:20:46.840 --> 3:20:47.840\n he's done government contract.\n\n3:20:47.840 --> 3:20:49.040\n He goes, there's government contract.\n\n3:20:49.040 --> 3:20:51.720\n And then there's working at SpaceX with Elon money.\n\n3:20:51.720 --> 3:20:55.220\n And that's what he refers to it as, is Elon money, where it was like, don't, I'll throw\n\n3:20:55.220 --> 3:20:57.460\n them and he would throw the money at it and make it happen.\n\n3:20:57.460 --> 3:20:58.960\n And it's, I'm talking this fast.\n\n3:20:58.960 --> 3:21:01.800\n I mean, he talks about, he has a great story about this.\n\n3:21:01.800 --> 3:21:04.740\n I mean, this is Elon, but this is how fast you can do in the private sector vice the\n\n3:21:04.740 --> 3:21:07.160\n government where there's the bureaucracy is.\n\n3:21:07.160 --> 3:21:11.240\n They had a company that was a, basically a tool and die machine shop that did a lot of\n\n3:21:11.240 --> 3:21:15.600\n their high precision parts for the rockets.\n\n3:21:15.600 --> 3:21:18.080\n They had went to the guy, but he had contracts with other companies.\n\n3:21:18.080 --> 3:21:22.360\n And when the economy was down, the guy was actually looking at going out of business.\n\n3:21:22.360 --> 3:21:24.860\n So the guy I know, he's telling me the story.\n\n3:21:24.860 --> 3:21:26.840\n He was talking to the guy, he had to go over there and get something.\n\n3:21:26.840 --> 3:21:27.840\n And he's like, holy shit.\n\n3:21:27.840 --> 3:21:28.840\n He goes, hang on.\n\n3:21:28.840 --> 3:21:32.280\n So he calls up on the phone, SpaceX, he says, Hey, is Elon there?\n\n3:21:32.280 --> 3:21:33.280\n Can you get them in the boardroom?\n\n3:21:33.280 --> 3:21:35.280\n We'll be there in 20 minutes.\n\n3:21:35.280 --> 3:21:39.160\n So he grabs this guy who's literally going to fold his company.\n\n3:21:39.160 --> 3:21:42.640\n They go over to SpaceX and I may be getting some of this wrong if people are going to\n\n3:21:42.640 --> 3:21:44.820\n fact check me, but this is pretty close.\n\n3:21:44.820 --> 3:21:52.600\n They go in the boardroom and he said, literally within like an hour or two, Elon has bought\n\n3:21:52.600 --> 3:21:53.780\n the guy's company.\n\n3:21:53.780 --> 3:21:57.340\n That guy is now a senior VP running his company.\n\n3:21:57.340 --> 3:22:01.200\n And they're going to pull all the stuff into the SpaceX thing so they can actually build\n\n3:22:01.200 --> 3:22:05.440\n the parts and they can still contract out to make the money outside.\n\n3:22:05.440 --> 3:22:07.200\n And it happened like that fast.\n\n3:22:07.200 --> 3:22:10.880\n It's not just money, it's because I've witnessed it too with Elon.\n\n3:22:10.880 --> 3:22:19.120\n I think it's whatever the forces of capitalism that allow a person like Elon Musk to rise\n\n3:22:19.120 --> 3:22:27.140\n to the top, because I've also worked for DARPA for research in terms of a source of funding.\n\n3:22:27.140 --> 3:22:32.200\n There's a weight of bureaucracy when I was working, being funded by DARPA.\n\n3:22:32.200 --> 3:22:37.180\n And with Elon, I was literally in the presence of anything is possible, cutting across all\n\n3:22:37.180 --> 3:22:43.080\n the bullshit of paperwork, of the way things were done in the past, of the bureaucracy,\n\n3:22:43.080 --> 3:22:48.280\n the rules, the constraints, all of that stuff, just you can cut across immediately.\n\n3:22:48.280 --> 3:22:51.480\n How much money and time do you waste dealing with your bureaucracy when you could actually\n\n3:22:51.480 --> 3:22:53.200\n be doing real work?\n\n3:22:53.200 --> 3:22:54.200\n That's the difference.\n\n3:22:54.200 --> 3:22:58.400\n This is why I honestly, when I went back to the industrial defense complex that we were\n\n3:22:58.400 --> 3:23:03.200\n warned about, when you look at it and go, SpaceX can do something for half the price\n\n3:23:03.200 --> 3:23:08.120\n ahead of schedule that what Boeing, we're paying Boeing, and you go, oh, well, this\n\n3:23:08.120 --> 3:23:09.120\n just came out.\n\n3:23:09.120 --> 3:23:12.520\n And you go, well, then why are we even dealing with this side when we can deal with this\n\n3:23:12.520 --> 3:23:13.620\n side?\n\n3:23:13.620 --> 3:23:17.240\n Because you've got a fully automated capsule that has a manual mode that they got to fly\n\n3:23:17.240 --> 3:23:18.660\n around in.\n\n3:23:18.660 --> 3:23:19.760\n It worked like a champ.\n\n3:23:19.760 --> 3:23:23.720\n It went up, it hung out, it came back, it splashed down.\n\n3:23:23.720 --> 3:23:25.960\n It worked perfectly.\n\n3:23:25.960 --> 3:23:26.960\n We're going to dust it off.\n\n3:23:26.960 --> 3:23:32.480\n And oh, by the way, unlike the Apollo capsules that were used and then put to museums, they're\n\n3:23:32.480 --> 3:23:34.040\n going to reuse that dragon capsule.\n\n3:23:34.040 --> 3:23:36.920\n It came down, they're going to dust it off, put a new coat of paint on it, slap it on\n\n3:23:36.920 --> 3:23:39.960\n top of another rocket and away it goes.\n\n3:23:39.960 --> 3:23:40.960\n Holy cow.\n\n3:23:40.960 --> 3:23:41.960\n It's amazing.\n\n3:23:41.960 --> 3:23:42.960\n It's a shift.\n\n3:23:42.960 --> 3:23:43.960\n It's a complete shift in mentality.\n\n3:23:43.960 --> 3:23:47.240\n And for us as taxpayers, we can explore at half the cost.\n\n3:23:47.240 --> 3:23:54.680\n It's exciting, especially given putting the Tic Tac in context, like then the sky or it's\n\n3:23:54.680 --> 3:23:57.480\n limitless the possibilities we could do with this kind of mechanism.\n\n3:23:57.480 --> 3:23:58.480\n I think it's exciting.\n\n3:23:58.480 --> 3:23:59.480\n Yeah.\n\n3:23:59.480 --> 3:24:00.480\n I think we live in an exciting time right now.\n\n3:24:00.480 --> 3:24:02.800\n This is everything that's messed up in the world right now.\n\n3:24:02.800 --> 3:24:08.000\n Well, this is a hopeful, like there's so much conflict going on, so much tension.\n\n3:24:08.000 --> 3:24:14.240\n That's to me, space exploration at the moment is a reason to get up in the morning and have\n\n3:24:14.240 --> 3:24:18.400\n a hope for the future, to look up to the sky and we're humans.\n\n3:24:18.400 --> 3:24:22.080\n We can solve so many, we can solve all of this.\n\n3:24:22.080 --> 3:24:26.880\n I was talking about when I was doing the Tucker thing and I said, this would be great, because\n\n3:24:26.880 --> 3:24:30.800\n then the government had come out a month ago and said, hey, this does exist.\n\n3:24:30.800 --> 3:24:33.840\n We're doing this and we're going to release more stuff.\n\n3:24:33.840 --> 3:24:38.080\n And I was texting like Lou and Chris Mellon and those guys before I went on, because they\n\n3:24:38.080 --> 3:24:42.700\n had called me up to be on Tucker's show and I'm like, hey, I go, this would be great.\n\n3:24:42.700 --> 3:24:48.200\n Just come out with this, find the relic of a spaceship, like pull out the Roswell wreckage\n\n3:24:48.200 --> 3:24:51.520\n if you have it, pull out the Roswell wreckage and do it.\n\n3:24:51.520 --> 3:24:57.320\n God, it would be so nice to not have to deal with the riots in the cities.\n\n3:24:57.320 --> 3:25:01.320\n I know it's an election year and all that, but God, it would be refreshing to not have\n\n3:25:01.320 --> 3:25:05.480\n to turn on my TV and see everything that is just depressing in the world.\n\n3:25:05.480 --> 3:25:09.640\n To begin, holy cow, we actually do have this and we're working on this technology.\n\n3:25:09.640 --> 3:25:14.220\n Imagine if there is a Roswell aircraft and they pull it out, imagine the innovation that\n\n3:25:14.220 --> 3:25:19.500\n happens in the next 10 to 20 years without any more information than that.\n\n3:25:19.500 --> 3:25:24.080\n Just the innovation that happens, the look on Elon Musk's face, the look on Jeff Bezos's\n\n3:25:24.080 --> 3:25:25.840\n face and all the brilliance in years.\n\n3:25:25.840 --> 3:25:26.840\n It would change the game.\n\n3:25:26.840 --> 3:25:27.840\n It would change the game.\n\n3:25:27.840 --> 3:25:28.840\n It would change the game completely.\n\n3:25:28.840 --> 3:25:33.560\n Let me ask the big question, I apologize for the absurd romantic nature of it.\n\n3:25:33.560 --> 3:25:42.000\n Outside, I mean, one of the things, the fact that you've laid your eyes on a UFO probably\n\n3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:48.160\n opened your eyes to the possibility that some of the other sightings, there could be other\n\n3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:50.800\n sightings that have legitimacy to them.\n\n3:25:50.800 --> 3:25:59.180\n What to you is the, outside of your own sighting, is the most interesting sighting or UFO related\n\n3:25:59.180 --> 3:26:01.520\n event in history?\n\n3:26:01.520 --> 3:26:03.000\n I think there's several.\n\n3:26:03.000 --> 3:26:04.000\n What is it?\n\n3:26:04.000 --> 3:26:09.640\n Ramassan Forest in England, the US guys that saw stuff and actually got radiation burns.\n\n3:26:09.640 --> 3:26:14.120\n One guy was medically disabled, but they weren't going to give him and he had help from John\n\n3:26:14.120 --> 3:26:15.120\n McCain.\n\n3:26:15.120 --> 3:26:20.000\n His office helped get the guy's disability reestablished.\n\n3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:22.720\n I think that's a big one.\n\n3:26:22.720 --> 3:26:27.040\n I think there's people out there that have seen stuff and I'm talking credible because\n\n3:26:27.040 --> 3:26:31.440\n there's, you got to remember, there's a huge chunk of the sightings that get disproven.\n\n3:26:31.440 --> 3:26:35.000\n They're actually explainable.\n\n3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:39.760\n You had sent me the question, the Phoenix lights, I think there's...\n\n3:26:39.760 --> 3:26:40.760\n What's that?\n\n3:26:40.760 --> 3:26:43.360\n So I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with some of these.\n\n3:26:43.360 --> 3:26:46.200\n I'm not either, you want a funny story on that.\n\n3:26:46.200 --> 3:26:53.760\n So I was at a conference, hopefully he doesn't watch this and get offended, but we had this,\n\n3:26:53.760 --> 3:26:54.960\n I call it speed dating.\n\n3:26:54.960 --> 3:26:58.680\n So there was a table, about eight people at a table and we would go sit at the table and\n\n3:26:58.680 --> 3:27:02.000\n they could ask us questions and then after 10 minutes we moved to the next table.\n\n3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:04.880\n So I was speed dating all these people that are really into this.\n\n3:27:04.880 --> 3:27:08.720\n It was kind of funny, but I had sat down and it's always funny because some people will\n\n3:27:08.720 --> 3:27:13.320\n try and dominate it, but you have to kind of push the dominators away so that if you're\n\n3:27:13.320 --> 3:27:16.560\n quiet and introverted, you can ask your question too.\n\n3:27:16.560 --> 3:27:19.500\n So we got into this and the guy starts naming all these, well, what about this?\n\n3:27:19.500 --> 3:27:20.500\n What about the Phoenix lights?\n\n3:27:20.500 --> 3:27:21.640\n I'm like, I don't know about the Phoenix lights.\n\n3:27:21.640 --> 3:27:22.640\n What about this event?\n\n3:27:22.640 --> 3:27:23.640\n I don't know about that.\n\n3:27:23.640 --> 3:27:26.720\n He goes, he looks at me and he goes, well, you're not a UFO guy.\n\n3:27:26.720 --> 3:27:29.240\n I go, no, I'm not, but I chased one.\n\n3:27:29.240 --> 3:27:30.240\n So I'm an expert.\n\n3:27:30.240 --> 3:27:31.240\n Have you?\n\n3:27:31.240 --> 3:27:33.960\n And you could see him get deflated because I'm kind of a smart ass like that.\n\n3:27:33.960 --> 3:27:38.600\n Yeah, I mean the firsthand experience from a credible, in some sense these sightings\n\n3:27:38.600 --> 3:27:41.440\n have to do both with the evidence and the human.\n\n3:27:41.440 --> 3:27:46.200\n Well, I think part of that is to us, that's a credibility piece because the four of us\n\n3:27:46.200 --> 3:27:50.840\n that actually saw it, plus the other two that were in the airplane that shot the video,\n\n3:27:50.840 --> 3:27:53.560\n none of us are UFO obsessed people.\n\n3:27:53.560 --> 3:27:59.200\n So when we come out and say, because to me it's five minutes of my life, I did a lot\n\n3:27:59.200 --> 3:28:06.400\n of really cool, I've had really kind of neat things I've been able to do.\n\n3:28:06.400 --> 3:28:14.280\n But when you look at it and go, to me it's not the pinnacle of my life.\n\n3:28:14.280 --> 3:28:18.920\n To other people that they live in the UFO world and it's like they, if you talk to people\n\n3:28:18.920 --> 3:28:26.440\n that are really into it, who've never seen one, it kills them that they didn't see one.\n\n3:28:26.440 --> 3:28:30.920\n When here we are, and what's unique with ours, which kind of adds that level is we just didn't\n\n3:28:30.920 --> 3:28:31.920\n see it.\n\n3:28:31.920 --> 3:28:34.880\n It wasn't like, oh look, something in the sky and it was weird.\n\n3:28:34.880 --> 3:28:39.000\n We actually engaged with it, it was an engaged five minute thing.\n\n3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:44.080\n And there's other stories from other countries, like there's a story in the back when the\n\n3:28:44.080 --> 3:28:49.080\n Soviet Union existed that they actually would chase these things and one of them shot at\n\n3:28:49.080 --> 3:28:53.480\n some, it shot it because they said shoot at it and it shot it and then it got shot down.\n\n3:28:53.480 --> 3:28:56.880\n And then they said, don't ever shoot at them again and don't chase them, just you can observe\n\n3:28:56.880 --> 3:29:00.320\n them, but don't go after them because obviously they have firepower that we can't control\n\n3:29:00.320 --> 3:29:03.920\n because if you can make something float around and jam radars at will and do whatever you\n\n3:29:03.920 --> 3:29:09.760\n want, modern terrestrial weapons are probably not very useful.\n\n3:29:09.760 --> 3:29:13.120\n You can go to Independence Day, they had that force field around, oh, we got to, now you\n\n3:29:13.120 --> 3:29:16.440\n got a cyber warfare, you got to take the bug down, you got to take the warfare, so now\n\n3:29:16.440 --> 3:29:19.000\n we can actually inhibit some type of damage.\n\n3:29:19.000 --> 3:29:25.060\n So there's, I mean, you mentioned the Phoenix lights, somebody on I think Reddit said, ask\n\n3:29:25.060 --> 3:29:28.720\n them any thoughts on mass UFO sightings like the Phoenix lights.\n\n3:29:28.720 --> 3:29:33.200\n So the interesting thing, like you said with the Tic Tac is that multiple people laid their\n\n3:29:33.200 --> 3:29:34.760\n eyes on this.\n\n3:29:34.760 --> 3:29:37.280\n What are your thoughts about the Phoenix lights where many people have seen it?\n\n3:29:37.280 --> 3:29:39.960\n So here's the deal with massive sightings.\n\n3:29:39.960 --> 3:29:43.320\n So the Phoenix lights is unexplainable, although I know the Air Force had said something about\n\n3:29:43.320 --> 3:29:44.800\n it was an A10 drop in flares.\n\n3:29:44.800 --> 3:29:47.320\n No, I don't think so.\n\n3:29:47.320 --> 3:29:51.720\n Flares don't burn that long, they just come out and they detract and they go away.\n\n3:29:51.720 --> 3:29:55.800\n Although on the other hand, there's, because clouds can do things, so I lived in Central\n\n3:29:55.800 --> 3:30:01.040\n California for 18 years and you would get, oh my God, what was that in the sky and it\n\n3:30:01.040 --> 3:30:03.460\n was really Vandenberg shooting a missile off.\n\n3:30:03.460 --> 3:30:07.260\n They were doing ICBM tests at one time where they shoot from Vandenberg and they fly across\n\n3:30:07.260 --> 3:30:11.640\n and they go land in the Atoll at Kwajalein and then they can check the displacement,\n\n3:30:11.640 --> 3:30:16.720\n the accuracy and all that stuff, it's stuff that we do because we're a superpower.\n\n3:30:16.720 --> 3:30:19.880\n But when you see them go up, especially if you've ever watched a rocket really launch\n\n3:30:19.880 --> 3:30:22.960\n on a clear night, it'll have the stream, the glow, and you can tell it's a rocket, but\n\n3:30:22.960 --> 3:30:26.740\n if you don't look up until later when it starts to get to the outer edge of the atmosphere\n\n3:30:26.740 --> 3:30:31.180\n where the plume coming out of the engine is not constrained, and you can watch this on\n\n3:30:31.180 --> 3:30:34.920\n TV when even the SpaceX ones go up, it's nice and narrow, narrow, narrow, and then it hits\n\n3:30:34.920 --> 3:30:38.600\n a point where it really starts to go up and it starts to come to the sides because the\n\n3:30:38.600 --> 3:30:43.760\n forces aren't holding that all into one unique thing and it looks really odd and then it'll\n\n3:30:43.760 --> 3:30:48.380\n go off because it burns out and then you get stage separation, then you see the next one\n\n3:30:48.380 --> 3:30:51.320\n go off and then it's gone.\n\n3:30:51.320 --> 3:30:53.920\n And people don't understand that because they didn't watch it from launch because we used\n\n3:30:53.920 --> 3:30:57.400\n to sit in our driveway and Vandenberg, it was a three hour drive, but you could sit and\n\n3:30:57.400 --> 3:30:58.400\n watch it.\n\n3:30:58.400 --> 3:31:02.520\n You knew they were launching at night, you'd watch, you'd watch and it's really cool.\n\n3:31:02.520 --> 3:31:06.200\n If you don't see anything, what you see is the weird clouds from the exhaust plume, what's\n\n3:31:06.200 --> 3:31:10.080\n left, the residue that's sitting in the atmosphere and the wind starts blowing it so you get\n\n3:31:10.080 --> 3:31:13.400\n these really kind of weird shapes in the sky.\n\n3:31:13.400 --> 3:31:17.160\n That's part, but when you go to Phoenix Lights and you go, hey, when a thousand people see\n\n3:31:17.160 --> 3:31:19.440\n something, are you going to discredit all a thousand people or are you going to try\n\n3:31:19.440 --> 3:31:26.760\n and explain it away with something else, you know, it's a weather balloon, it's a weather\n\n3:31:26.760 --> 3:31:27.760\n balloon.\n\n3:31:27.760 --> 3:31:34.160\n Again, just like the Tic Tac, I think is just inspiring for the limitless nature of the\n\n3:31:34.160 --> 3:31:35.760\n science.\n\n3:31:35.760 --> 3:31:37.400\n I think more is going to come out.\n\n3:31:37.400 --> 3:31:42.760\n I think some of the stuff that the To The Stars folks have done.\n\n3:31:42.760 --> 3:31:44.880\n So there's a To The Stars Academy.\n\n3:31:44.880 --> 3:31:45.880\n What are your thoughts about them?\n\n3:31:45.880 --> 3:31:46.880\n Are they?\n\n3:31:46.880 --> 3:31:48.520\n I talk to them quite a bit.\n\n3:31:48.520 --> 3:31:52.280\n I'm not a part of To The Stars Academy.\n\n3:31:52.280 --> 3:31:57.320\n But I talked to Lou, I just was texting him before this.\n\n3:31:57.320 --> 3:31:58.320\n What's their mission?\n\n3:31:58.320 --> 3:31:59.320\n What's their hope?\n\n3:31:59.320 --> 3:32:06.380\n When they started, their mission was to try and, don't look at this as little green men,\n\n3:32:06.380 --> 3:32:11.600\n but let's look at this as a technology and let's try and almost reverse engineer and\n\n3:32:11.600 --> 3:32:17.240\n figure out how these things operate and how can we explain this from using our knowledge,\n\n3:32:17.240 --> 3:32:20.080\n workspace knowledge to go, how would something like this operate?\n\n3:32:20.080 --> 3:32:24.520\n That's really their bottom line was to try and use and then couple that with, because\n\n3:32:24.520 --> 3:32:31.600\n they've got the series unidentified, couple that with television to get the word out.\n\n3:32:31.600 --> 3:32:34.800\n So you're actually putting something instead of...\n\n3:32:34.800 --> 3:32:39.320\n Because everyone has a theory, you know, Ancient Aliens covers all kinds of theories, you know,\n\n3:32:39.320 --> 3:32:43.560\n it's kind of off of, oh my God, and I've seen the stuff and I've seen stuff that I've said\n\n3:32:43.560 --> 3:32:48.040\n taken out of context on shows that I did not talk to.\n\n3:32:48.040 --> 3:32:51.200\n So there's all that, because you can take a clip and go, oh, it's this, it's that, you\n\n3:32:51.200 --> 3:32:52.200\n know?\n\n3:32:52.200 --> 3:32:55.200\n And if I know about stuff like it, you can't technically use my likeness unless I tell\n\n3:32:55.200 --> 3:32:56.420\n you you can.\n\n3:32:56.420 --> 3:32:59.080\n So if I haven't signed something you can't do, there was a guy who put something out,\n\n3:32:59.080 --> 3:33:01.560\n you know, I was in it and I told him, you can take it down and you can talk to lawyers\n\n3:33:01.560 --> 3:33:03.680\n because I'm not supporting you.\n\n3:33:03.680 --> 3:33:07.600\n So they use it to tell some kind of narrative that's not connected to reality.\n\n3:33:07.600 --> 3:33:10.920\n Because let's face it, if you're making TV shows, there's two reasons to do it.\n\n3:33:10.920 --> 3:33:15.160\n One, you want to get word out, or two, you want to make money, or three, both.\n\n3:33:15.160 --> 3:33:19.600\n And so usually it's, I would say the make money is probably the biggest thing to put\n\n3:33:19.600 --> 3:33:20.600\n a TV show out.\n\n3:33:20.600 --> 3:33:27.240\n And the mission of the To The Stars Academy is to not do that, is to try to get some...\n\n3:33:27.240 --> 3:33:31.720\n When they started and I talked to them, because I've talked to Tom and I've talked to Lou\n\n3:33:31.720 --> 3:33:38.200\n and those are the two main players, it was to basically demystify the fact and get rid\n\n3:33:38.200 --> 3:33:43.220\n of the stigma that's tied to UFOs, and let's look at it from a science base and then use\n\n3:33:43.220 --> 3:33:45.800\n TV to get the word out on the progress.\n\n3:33:45.800 --> 3:33:47.000\n And they've done some pretty cool things.\n\n3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:52.720\n I mean, you know, the Italian government gave them all kinds of files that had been property\n\n3:33:52.720 --> 3:33:53.720\n of their government.\n\n3:33:53.720 --> 3:33:54.720\n They got a bunch from...\n\n3:33:54.720 --> 3:33:59.340\n It might have been Argentina gave them all kinds of stuff, like, here's all our records,\n\n3:33:59.340 --> 3:34:00.340\n what can you do with it?\n\n3:34:00.340 --> 3:34:04.800\n To try and now pull from country based to a more global based research, which is what\n\n3:34:04.800 --> 3:34:09.800\n you were talking about, and then using independent scientists that are not tied to a government.\n\n3:34:09.800 --> 3:34:13.840\n I mean, any government, but just using independent research agencies to start looking at some\n\n3:34:13.840 --> 3:34:16.960\n of the metallurgy, because you go, oh, I found this, we had this piece of metal, what is\n\n3:34:16.960 --> 3:34:17.960\n it?\n\n3:34:17.960 --> 3:34:18.960\n And some of the stuff has been explained.\n\n3:34:18.960 --> 3:34:22.000\n They've got some objects, artifacts that have not been explained.\n\n3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:24.600\n And that's slowly coming out, you know, and I think...\n\n3:34:24.600 --> 3:34:27.760\n And your hope is the US government will release some more things?\n\n3:34:27.760 --> 3:34:33.480\n The US government came out a month ago and said, we have material that we cannot explain\n\n3:34:33.480 --> 3:34:35.220\n the origin.\n\n3:34:35.220 --> 3:34:36.220\n They have said that.\n\n3:34:36.220 --> 3:34:39.520\n They just haven't released the records from the Roswell thing, which I keep joking about.\n\n3:34:39.520 --> 3:34:41.320\n I'm like, come on, it's 70 some years old.\n\n3:34:41.320 --> 3:34:43.440\n I mean, like, let it out.\n\n3:34:43.440 --> 3:34:49.640\n I think you put it beautifully that in this time, that will be a heck of an inspiring,\n\n3:34:49.640 --> 3:34:50.640\n hopeful thing to see.\n\n3:34:50.640 --> 3:34:52.040\n Like people don't...\n\n3:34:52.040 --> 3:34:53.040\n Just to distract them.\n\n3:34:53.040 --> 3:34:54.040\n Right?\n\n3:34:54.040 --> 3:35:02.360\n Yeah, the division is, I mean, nothing will unite us humans, descendants of chimps.\n\n3:35:02.360 --> 3:35:05.800\n Like the idea that there's life out there.\n\n3:35:05.800 --> 3:35:06.800\n It would literally change.\n\n3:35:06.800 --> 3:35:10.640\n I said this a while ago, I think it was the London Sun Times had called me and I said,\n\n3:35:10.640 --> 3:35:12.480\n you know, personally, I think this is a global issue.\n\n3:35:12.480 --> 3:35:13.480\n It's not.\n\n3:35:13.480 --> 3:35:16.400\n If there is stuff coming down, which we're pretty sure there is, there's enough stuff\n\n3:35:16.400 --> 3:35:18.520\n that we can't explain.\n\n3:35:18.520 --> 3:35:21.720\n If there is stuff coming down, then this is not a country based thing and it's not about\n\n3:35:21.720 --> 3:35:25.360\n technology and it's not about who's going to win the next war because you don't know\n\n3:35:25.360 --> 3:35:27.000\n what they're doing.\n\n3:35:27.000 --> 3:35:29.360\n So you got really a couple of theories.\n\n3:35:29.360 --> 3:35:35.400\n One, you've got ET or close encounters and the other extreme is you've got Independence\n\n3:35:35.400 --> 3:35:36.660\n Day.\n\n3:35:36.660 --> 3:35:41.880\n Are you going to prepare and bet on ET and close encounters or do you actually try and\n\n3:35:41.880 --> 3:35:45.560\n do stuff in case it is Independence Day, you actually have a game plan.\n\n3:35:45.560 --> 3:35:49.680\n And when you get into Independence Day, that scenario, you know, and I don't like going\n\n3:35:49.680 --> 3:35:54.820\n too much into sci fi, but let's just say in theory that that becomes a reality.\n\n3:35:54.820 --> 3:36:02.980\n It's not a US, Russia, China, England, France, Spain, name any country in any continent.\n\n3:36:02.980 --> 3:36:07.560\n It becomes a global issue and the only way you can deny it, it's just like Americans.\n\n3:36:07.560 --> 3:36:10.760\n We all, you know, we're divided.\n\n3:36:10.760 --> 3:36:11.920\n We spend that way forever.\n\n3:36:11.920 --> 3:36:14.280\n So if you think we won't get through this, we'll get through it because we've had times\n\n3:36:14.280 --> 3:36:16.080\n just like this before.\n\n3:36:16.080 --> 3:36:17.400\n Until Nazi Germany pops up.\n\n3:36:17.400 --> 3:36:20.980\n But Nazi Germany pops up or someone flies two airplanes into the World Trade Center\n\n3:36:20.980 --> 3:36:22.720\n and then all of a sudden we're all like united.\n\n3:36:22.720 --> 3:36:25.640\n We all also have very, very short memories.\n\n3:36:25.640 --> 3:36:27.040\n Yes, we do.\n\n3:36:27.040 --> 3:36:28.040\n Exactly.\n\n3:36:28.040 --> 3:36:34.760\n It's when you look and go, well, we can do this and you go, no, no, if you think that\n\n3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:41.560\n everyone on the planet is good, you need to stop taking the drugs that you're taking.\n\n3:36:41.560 --> 3:36:46.080\n You know, we said this, there were people during the rise of Hitler, no, no, it's it's\n\n3:36:46.080 --> 3:36:47.080\n OK.\n\n3:36:47.080 --> 3:36:48.080\n And no, no, it's OK.\n\n3:36:48.080 --> 3:36:49.080\n We're not going to do.\n\n3:36:49.080 --> 3:36:50.080\n We're not going to stop.\n\n3:36:50.080 --> 3:36:51.080\n No, no, it's OK.\n\n3:36:51.080 --> 3:36:52.080\n No, no, it's OK.\n\n3:36:52.080 --> 3:36:53.080\n No, no, it's OK.\n\n3:36:53.080 --> 3:36:59.240\n The only thing that stopped Hitler was his ego by going into Russia.\n\n3:36:59.240 --> 3:37:03.960\n If he just stuck with the pact with Stalin and not went to the east and had to fight\n\n3:37:03.960 --> 3:37:07.800\n and it was really the Russian winner that crushed him and he would have put all his\n\n3:37:07.800 --> 3:37:12.600\n high troops to the other side, there would have been a totally different outcome.\n\n3:37:12.600 --> 3:37:16.840\n The man in the iron, the man in the high tower, whatever, it's a Netflix show where Nazi actually\n\n3:37:16.840 --> 3:37:17.840\n wins it.\n\n3:37:17.840 --> 3:37:22.480\n And you look, you know, we didn't know everything that was going on, especially the atrocities\n\n3:37:22.480 --> 3:37:26.160\n with the concentration camps and what he was doing to the Jews.\n\n3:37:26.160 --> 3:37:29.600\n I mean, it's you look at that going, if you really want to see evil and then there's the\n\n3:37:29.600 --> 3:37:33.960\n whole side of what Stalin did because he actually exterminated more people than Hitler did.\n\n3:37:33.960 --> 3:37:36.040\n But that never gets the press.\n\n3:37:36.040 --> 3:37:41.840\n And the thing is, we forget this, we forget this history in our conflicts today.\n\n3:37:41.840 --> 3:37:44.160\n We forget that there is the nature of evil.\n\n3:37:44.160 --> 3:37:47.400\n We forget that there's real evil in the world.\n\n3:37:47.400 --> 3:37:53.200\n And the thing to fight that evil is to be united, to be both.\n\n3:37:53.200 --> 3:37:59.160\n It's like this interesting line, like you talked about Joe Rogan, of being both like\n\n3:37:59.160 --> 3:38:08.000\n kind to each other, compassionate, empathetic, but also being like strong and a bad motherfucker\n\n3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:14.360\n when you need to, to make sure that you, that like there's a balance between kindness and\n\n3:38:14.360 --> 3:38:15.360\n force.\n\n3:38:15.360 --> 3:38:19.760\n You use force when force is necessary, but you don't have to walk around like Billy\n\n3:38:19.760 --> 3:38:20.760\n Badass all the time.\n\n3:38:20.760 --> 3:38:24.500\n I mean, some of the toughest people that I grew up with that literally could kick the\n\n3:38:24.500 --> 3:38:28.760\n shit out of whoever came near them, they never got in fights because one, even people that\n\n3:38:28.760 --> 3:38:31.840\n didn't know them, because they were actually nice guys.\n\n3:38:31.840 --> 3:38:34.480\n You know, they were just good dudes.\n\n3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:39.480\n But you know, if you cross them, like I had a friend of mine, he's a nationally ranked\n\n3:38:39.480 --> 3:38:40.480\n wrestler.\n\n3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:45.080\n He went to Naval Academy with me, he's a very, very good friend of mine.\n\n3:38:45.080 --> 3:38:51.760\n And he is, when you meet him and he wrestled at 190 pounds and he did not lose a match\n\n3:38:51.760 --> 3:38:54.440\n his senior year until he went to nationals, he just had a bad day.\n\n3:38:54.440 --> 3:38:57.740\n He actually lost to a guy he had pummeled the shit out of.\n\n3:38:57.740 --> 3:38:58.740\n And he would cross.\n\n3:38:58.740 --> 3:39:01.920\n It was funny, we joke about it even with him, because when you meet him, he's like the nicest\n\n3:39:01.920 --> 3:39:04.680\n like local, hey dude, you know, hey, how are you doing?\n\n3:39:04.680 --> 3:39:05.680\n He's super nice.\n\n3:39:05.680 --> 3:39:08.880\n And he would cross that ring on a wrestling mat.\n\n3:39:08.880 --> 3:39:13.220\n As soon as he crossed that ring, it was like a totally different person and he would go\n\n3:39:13.220 --> 3:39:15.360\n out there and just destroy people.\n\n3:39:15.360 --> 3:39:19.640\n I mean, physically destroy, like put a hurt on.\n\n3:39:19.640 --> 3:39:24.060\n And he would get done and he's like super humble and they'd raise his hand and he'd\n\n3:39:24.060 --> 3:39:28.000\n have this blank expression, they'd raise his hand and he'd walk off and as soon as he crossed\n\n3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:31.040\n the line, he'd look up and smile and go, hey, hi guys, how you doing?\n\n3:39:31.040 --> 3:39:33.500\n Like he literally just went and could rip someone's arms off.\n\n3:39:33.500 --> 3:39:35.400\n But as soon as he crossed the line, he was a totally different person.\n\n3:39:35.400 --> 3:39:37.040\n He's like, and he's that way today.\n\n3:39:37.040 --> 3:39:40.080\n He won't even tell you he's a wrestler.\n\n3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:43.900\n That's kind of a symbol of the best of America.\n\n3:39:43.900 --> 3:39:44.900\n That's what America is.\n\n3:39:44.900 --> 3:39:45.900\n Oh, he's.\n\n3:39:45.900 --> 3:39:46.900\n That wrestler.\n\n3:39:46.900 --> 3:39:47.900\n He's a.\n\n3:39:47.900 --> 3:39:53.900\n You cross the line, you can be hard, but once you're off the mat, you're just a kind human\n\n3:39:53.900 --> 3:39:54.900\n being.\n\n3:39:54.900 --> 3:39:55.900\n Yeah.\n\n3:39:55.900 --> 3:40:06.520\n I know you're super humble, saying it's better to be lucky than good, but your story is inspiring.\n\n3:40:06.520 --> 3:40:11.980\n The entire trajectory of having a dream, of accomplishing that dream, of having one hell\n\n3:40:11.980 --> 3:40:13.700\n of a career.\n\n3:40:13.700 --> 3:40:20.940\n What advice would you give to a young person, to a young version of yourself today that\n\n3:40:20.940 --> 3:40:27.460\n listens to this and is inspired, that wants to fly or wants to go to space and wants to\n\n3:40:27.460 --> 3:40:28.460\n build the rocket?\n\n3:40:28.460 --> 3:40:34.020\n Is there advice you could give them about life, about career, about anything?\n\n3:40:34.020 --> 3:40:35.020\n Yeah.\n\n3:40:35.020 --> 3:40:36.020\n Yeah.\n\n3:40:36.020 --> 3:40:43.300\n First, let me start with, and you had a question on, inspirational people.\n\n3:40:43.300 --> 3:40:49.940\n My grandfather, I had mentioned him earlier, huge funeral, beer delivery guy, was delivering\n\n3:40:49.940 --> 3:40:55.300\n beer in the 60s riots where the guys in the black neighborhoods where white people didn't\n\n3:40:55.300 --> 3:40:56.340\n go.\n\n3:40:56.340 --> 3:40:57.340\n My grandfather's Sicilian.\n\n3:40:57.340 --> 3:41:00.200\n He was one of the first ones in his family born in the United States.\n\n3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:03.180\n My great grandmother and I had aunts and uncles that I knew growing up that actually came\n\n3:41:03.180 --> 3:41:06.000\n over on the boat.\n\n3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:11.780\n Huge, huge guy and just the nicest, friendliest, would give you the shirt off his back, obviously\n\n3:41:11.780 --> 3:41:12.780\n proven by his funeral.\n\n3:41:12.780 --> 3:41:17.620\n I'm talking at his funeral, the head of the Black Panthers was at his funeral in Toledo,\n\n3:41:17.620 --> 3:41:18.620\n Ohio.\n\n3:41:18.620 --> 3:41:21.860\n The mafia guys were at his funeral in Toledo, Ohio.\n\n3:41:21.860 --> 3:41:26.020\n It was literally a mix of who's who.\n\n3:41:26.020 --> 3:41:29.140\n He had told me once, because when you're little, you start looking.\n\n3:41:29.140 --> 3:41:32.340\n I grew up basically, I was probably middle class, lower middle class.\n\n3:41:32.340 --> 3:41:33.340\n My dad was a fireman.\n\n3:41:33.340 --> 3:41:34.340\n You're not rich.\n\n3:41:34.340 --> 3:41:35.340\n He's working for the city.\n\n3:41:35.340 --> 3:41:37.500\n Paycheck to paycheck living is how I grew up.\n\n3:41:37.500 --> 3:41:41.500\n I was talking to my grandfather one day and he said something to me, and this is literally\n\n3:41:41.500 --> 3:41:42.500\n how I run my life.\n\n3:41:42.500 --> 3:41:45.820\n He said, it was about money because you'd see back in the day, if you saw someone in\n\n3:41:45.820 --> 3:41:47.580\n a Mercedes, that was rare.\n\n3:41:47.580 --> 3:41:48.580\n They weren't everywhere.\n\n3:41:48.580 --> 3:41:53.900\n You couldn't lease a car, you actually bought a car and usually bought a car with cash.\n\n3:41:53.900 --> 3:41:56.080\n It was a totally different than we are now.\n\n3:41:56.080 --> 3:42:00.340\n He said, he goes, you know, David, he goes, they're no better than you and you're no better\n\n3:42:00.340 --> 3:42:01.340\n than anyone else.\n\n3:42:01.340 --> 3:42:02.780\n He goes, you got to remember that.\n\n3:42:02.780 --> 3:42:03.780\n He goes, everyone's different.\n\n3:42:03.780 --> 3:42:07.660\n He goes, treat everyone with the respect and dignity that they deserve.\n\n3:42:07.660 --> 3:42:13.340\n He goes, and if they're poor, if they're homeless, he goes, it doesn't make them a bad person.\n\n3:42:13.340 --> 3:42:17.300\n That's who they chose to be and you make choices in your life, but never ever look down on\n\n3:42:17.300 --> 3:42:20.820\n someone because there will always be someone that will look down on you and you should\n\n3:42:20.820 --> 3:42:22.300\n never ever do that.\n\n3:42:22.300 --> 3:42:23.300\n I kept that close to me.\n\n3:42:23.300 --> 3:42:29.500\n He was a huge influence, my mom's dad, just a big, big influence in my life and the way\n\n3:42:29.500 --> 3:42:31.900\n I carried myself.\n\n3:42:31.900 --> 3:42:36.540\n He was one that would say, you can be anything you want to be.\n\n3:42:36.540 --> 3:42:41.300\n He grew up dirt poor and the fact that he had bought a house and took good care of my\n\n3:42:41.300 --> 3:42:45.740\n grandmother and did stuff like that, to him, that was a success.\n\n3:42:45.740 --> 3:42:48.800\n To me, it was always trying to better and move on.\n\n3:42:48.800 --> 3:42:53.820\n He was the one, my parents were a big part of this too, was instilling that anything\n\n3:42:53.820 --> 3:42:55.020\n is possible.\n\n3:42:55.020 --> 3:43:00.380\n When I'm four years and 11 months old in 1969 and I'm watching Neil Armstrong walk on the\n\n3:43:00.380 --> 3:43:04.180\n moon and I'm asking my mom and she says, well, they were all military pilots.\n\n3:43:04.180 --> 3:43:09.620\n We had an Air National Guard that at the time was flying F100, so I'm dating myself.\n\n3:43:09.620 --> 3:43:12.780\n I was just fascinated with flight and I just looked at that going, that's really what I\n\n3:43:12.780 --> 3:43:13.780\n want to do.\n\n3:43:13.780 --> 3:43:14.780\n I never lost sight of that.\n\n3:43:14.780 --> 3:43:16.380\n There was always, I could do this or do that.\n\n3:43:16.380 --> 3:43:20.300\n When I was going to go to college before I enlisted in the Marine Corps, I was accepted\n\n3:43:20.300 --> 3:43:24.780\n into Natural Resources at Ohio State and I'm like, if I can't fly, I'll go be a forest\n\n3:43:24.780 --> 3:43:27.700\n ranger because I wanted to hang out in one of those towers in Colorado and look for\n\n3:43:27.700 --> 3:43:30.980\n fires because that's just, I like that stuff.\n\n3:43:30.980 --> 3:43:33.900\n It was that or be an oceanographer because I was fascinated with Jacques Cousteau and\n\n3:43:33.900 --> 3:43:34.900\n actually that's my degree.\n\n3:43:34.900 --> 3:43:38.940\n My undergrad degree is Jacques Cousteau, so influences are Neil Armstrong and Jacques\n\n3:43:38.940 --> 3:43:39.940\n Cousteau.\n\n3:43:39.940 --> 3:43:40.940\n I have an oceanography degree.\n\n3:43:40.940 --> 3:43:45.740\n I got an MBA from University of Houston, go Cougs, got to mention them.\n\n3:43:45.740 --> 3:43:48.300\n So you look and people go, what are you going to do with that?\n\n3:43:48.300 --> 3:43:52.220\n And I said, I got an oceanography degree because I got, well, I'm going to sail on the ocean,\n\n3:43:52.220 --> 3:43:56.300\n so at least if the ship sinks, I'll know where I'm at and that was a kind of a running joke\n\n3:43:56.300 --> 3:43:57.300\n and then...\n\n3:43:57.300 --> 3:44:03.860\n So these passions and underneath it is the belief that you can be anything you want to\n\n3:44:03.860 --> 3:44:04.860\n be.\n\n3:44:04.860 --> 3:44:05.860\n You can.\n\n3:44:05.860 --> 3:44:09.540\n I told my kids this, when they were young, it was tough, especially for my son.\n\n3:44:09.540 --> 3:44:13.540\n So when Nate was about five, six years, we knew Nate was colorblind.\n\n3:44:13.540 --> 3:44:15.460\n My wife's brothers are both colorblind.\n\n3:44:15.460 --> 3:44:16.460\n It's really color deprived.\n\n3:44:16.460 --> 3:44:18.100\n Color blind, you see black and white.\n\n3:44:18.100 --> 3:44:19.100\n He can't tell.\n\n3:44:19.100 --> 3:44:20.960\n He has issues with greens, reds, browns.\n\n3:44:20.960 --> 3:44:24.140\n It's funny if you're ever around someone like that because he'll go, what are you looking\n\n3:44:24.140 --> 3:44:25.140\n at?\n\n3:44:25.140 --> 3:44:26.140\n He goes right over there by the red thing.\n\n3:44:26.140 --> 3:44:27.140\n I'm like, what are you looking at?\n\n3:44:27.140 --> 3:44:28.140\n I go, this?\n\n3:44:28.140 --> 3:44:29.140\n He had a hat on one day.\n\n3:44:29.140 --> 3:44:30.140\n I go, which one are you going to get?\n\n3:44:30.140 --> 3:44:31.140\n He had a hat in his hand.\n\n3:44:31.140 --> 3:44:32.140\n It was green.\n\n3:44:32.140 --> 3:44:33.140\n He goes, I'm going to get the green one.\n\n3:44:33.140 --> 3:44:34.140\n I go, oh, this one right here.\n\n3:44:34.140 --> 3:44:35.140\n He goes, no, the one on my head.\n\n3:44:35.140 --> 3:44:36.140\n I go, Nate, that one's brown.\n\n3:44:36.140 --> 3:44:37.140\n He's like, leave me alone, dad.\n\n3:44:37.140 --> 3:44:40.340\n He got the brown hat because to him it looked great.\n\n3:44:40.340 --> 3:44:41.660\n So he couldn't fly.\n\n3:44:41.660 --> 3:44:43.300\n He came to me and said, I go, what do you want to do, Nate?\n\n3:44:43.300 --> 3:44:44.740\n You're talking to your kids and what do you want to do?\n\n3:44:44.740 --> 3:44:45.740\n He goes, I want to be a pilot.\n\n3:44:45.740 --> 3:44:50.020\n Now I got to tell him because he's looking at me because I'm a pilot, you can't be a\n\n3:44:50.020 --> 3:44:51.020\n pilot.\n\n3:44:51.020 --> 3:44:57.140\n I go, why can't I be a pilot, I said, because you got eye issues, so you got to redirect.\n\n3:44:57.140 --> 3:45:02.060\n The other one was because I stopped flying when I was 42 years old and it was my childhood\n\n3:45:02.060 --> 3:45:03.060\n dream.\n\n3:45:03.060 --> 3:45:04.060\n So it's like a pro athlete.\n\n3:45:04.060 --> 3:45:08.620\n I know exactly what it feels like when Brett Favre has to walk away from the NFL when you\n\n3:45:08.620 --> 3:45:09.620\n still can do it.\n\n3:45:09.620 --> 3:45:12.940\n Good choice of quarterback, by the way, the greatest of all time, but whatever.\n\n3:45:12.940 --> 3:45:17.740\n So you do and you look at it and you go, I understand what those guys feel like when\n\n3:45:17.740 --> 3:45:22.740\n you have to walk away from something that you love and you think you can still do it.\n\n3:45:22.740 --> 3:45:27.180\n So I told them, I said, look, I was talking to both of my kids and I said, you know, find\n\n3:45:27.180 --> 3:45:34.100\n something that you want to do, that you love to do and that you can do your whole life.\n\n3:45:34.100 --> 3:45:37.460\n And you should be able to do good things for other people.\n\n3:45:37.460 --> 3:45:39.900\n You want to be able to help other people.\n\n3:45:39.900 --> 3:45:40.900\n That's what I said.\n\n3:45:40.900 --> 3:45:45.500\n So both of my kids and there's no one in my family, both of my children, one of them\n\n3:45:45.500 --> 3:45:49.920\n is, my daughter is a doctor doing a residency in internal medicine right now.\n\n3:45:49.920 --> 3:45:53.840\n And my son is in his third year and they're both going to be doctors.\n\n3:45:53.840 --> 3:45:56.660\n And until I look at it as, you know, people go, oh, you got two doctors.\n\n3:45:56.660 --> 3:45:57.660\n I don't care.\n\n3:45:57.660 --> 3:46:01.420\n I told my kids, if you want to be a garbage man or you want to dig ditches, I don't care.\n\n3:46:01.420 --> 3:46:06.020\n Just be, be the best ditch digger that you can be, I said, and be happy doing it.\n\n3:46:06.020 --> 3:46:09.660\n Because what you also find is that we are in this big pursuit of money, money, money,\n\n3:46:09.660 --> 3:46:10.940\n money, money, money, money.\n\n3:46:10.940 --> 3:46:11.940\n That's what makes the world go round.\n\n3:46:11.940 --> 3:46:16.100\n But what you realize, and I'll go back to my grandfather who didn't have a lot of money\n\n3:46:16.100 --> 3:46:18.340\n and he was probably one of the most happy people on life.\n\n3:46:18.340 --> 3:46:20.140\n And unfortunately he died at, he died at 65.\n\n3:46:20.140 --> 3:46:24.540\n He had a massive heart attack because he didn't tell that he, he kind of knew it was happening\n\n3:46:24.540 --> 3:46:30.140\n and he just made the choice to do it and it was devastating to the entire family.\n\n3:46:30.140 --> 3:46:32.280\n But he didn't, he didn't have a lot of money.\n\n3:46:32.280 --> 3:46:35.020\n But I'll tell you what, I know a lot of rich people who have funerals and there's nobody\n\n3:46:35.020 --> 3:46:36.020\n at them.\n\n3:46:36.020 --> 3:46:37.020\n Yeah.\n\n3:46:37.020 --> 3:46:41.480\n And my grandfather, who's a beer delivery guy had, I, I, it literally, it was like three\n\n3:46:41.480 --> 3:46:42.480\n miles long.\n\n3:46:42.480 --> 3:46:43.480\n The Pope.\n\n3:46:43.480 --> 3:46:44.480\n It was crazy.\n\n3:46:44.480 --> 3:46:45.480\n Yeah.\n\n3:46:45.480 --> 3:46:46.480\n Who died?\n\n3:46:46.480 --> 3:46:47.480\n The Pope.\n\n3:46:47.480 --> 3:46:48.480\n That was because there was like, Hey, he's a Catholic.\n\n3:46:48.480 --> 3:46:49.480\n He's just, you know, Italian.\n\n3:46:49.480 --> 3:46:50.480\n He goes, you know, who died?\n\n3:46:50.480 --> 3:46:51.480\n The Pope.\n\n3:46:51.480 --> 3:46:52.480\n And I go, no, that was my grandfather.\n\n3:46:52.480 --> 3:46:53.480\n And then the next funeral I went to was my aunt, his sister.\n\n3:46:53.480 --> 3:46:54.540\n And it was like, you know, 30 people.\n\n3:46:54.540 --> 3:46:57.380\n And I looked at my mother and I said, where's everybody at?\n\n3:46:57.380 --> 3:47:00.480\n She goes, Oh, no, this is normal.\n\n3:47:00.480 --> 3:47:02.700\n This is what a normal funeral looks like.\n\n3:47:02.700 --> 3:47:08.060\n So it's, you know, for young kids, bottom line, one, be nice.\n\n3:47:08.060 --> 3:47:09.060\n Kindness will get you.\n\n3:47:09.060 --> 3:47:10.700\n I'm a big believer in karma.\n\n3:47:10.700 --> 3:47:13.000\n Kindness will get you a long way in the world.\n\n3:47:13.000 --> 3:47:14.000\n You know, it's easy.\n\n3:47:14.000 --> 3:47:15.720\n It's, it's, it's easy to be nice.\n\n3:47:15.720 --> 3:47:17.580\n It doesn't cost you anything.\n\n3:47:17.580 --> 3:47:19.860\n I said, you know, and get rid of the hate.\n\n3:47:19.860 --> 3:47:23.700\n And number two is follow your dreams because everyone is capable of everything.\n\n3:47:23.700 --> 3:47:27.460\n And there's a, there's a self realism, like, you know, if you really have trouble with\n\n3:47:27.460 --> 3:47:32.200\n math, getting a PhD in applied math is probably not something you're going to be able to do,\n\n3:47:32.200 --> 3:47:35.340\n but understand yourself, what your own capabilities are.\n\n3:47:35.340 --> 3:47:38.220\n And you know, inside your heart, don't let anyone ever tell you what you can and can't\n\n3:47:38.220 --> 3:47:39.220\n do.\n\n3:47:39.220 --> 3:47:43.860\n Just look at yourself and go for it and, and, and you can do anything.\n\n3:47:43.860 --> 3:47:47.220\n It's just, it's, it's a great, the world's incredible.\n\n3:47:47.220 --> 3:47:48.220\n It really is.\n\n3:47:48.220 --> 3:47:52.540\n Let me ask the last big, ridiculous question.\n\n3:47:52.540 --> 3:47:59.420\n So you've lived much of your life, your career is kind of at the edge of life and death.\n\n3:47:59.420 --> 3:48:06.180\n So let me ask kind of several different ways, the same kind of question.\n\n3:48:06.180 --> 3:48:12.860\n One, do you, have you pondered your mortality, the finiteness of it?\n\n3:48:12.860 --> 3:48:20.540\n And the bigger question to ask, even in the context of your, uh, tic tac encounter is,\n\n3:48:20.540 --> 3:48:25.700\n uh, what do you think is the meaning of this, uh, thing we got going on here?\n\n3:48:25.700 --> 3:48:31.020\n The meaning of life, human life in this sense.\n\n3:48:31.020 --> 3:48:33.940\n So let me start with, have I pondered my own mortality?\n\n3:48:33.940 --> 3:48:34.940\n Yes.\n\n3:48:34.940 --> 3:48:36.900\n Very often.\n\n3:48:36.900 --> 3:48:40.960\n And I don't get into my religious beliefs or what I am, but I will tell you that I do\n\n3:48:40.960 --> 3:48:42.560\n believe in God.\n\n3:48:42.560 --> 3:48:46.660\n I've just seen too many things in the world that I can't explain.\n\n3:48:46.660 --> 3:48:49.820\n And some people will explain it by subconscious, so I'll give you a story and this kind of\n\n3:48:49.820 --> 3:48:52.860\n puts in the thing of, do I fear death?\n\n3:48:52.860 --> 3:48:55.960\n So I had a good friend of mine that I used to fly with, we were stationed in Japan together\n\n3:48:55.960 --> 3:49:01.380\n and Japan had this incinerator that put all kinds of dioxins, so there's a real high cancer\n\n3:49:01.380 --> 3:49:07.740\n rate for those that served on the base in Atsugi, Japan.\n\n3:49:07.740 --> 3:49:12.820\n Him and his wife had one son, um, and their son passed away just before his 18th birthday\n\n3:49:12.820 --> 3:49:14.820\n of cancer.\n\n3:49:14.820 --> 3:49:19.900\n And I was hanging out with, I'll call him John, and I was hanging out with John, we\n\n3:49:19.900 --> 3:49:24.300\n were in oil and gas, he had come to the same company and we were doing an event together\n\n3:49:24.300 --> 3:49:27.140\n and he was opening up to me because we were actually the demo pilots.\n\n3:49:27.140 --> 3:49:32.460\n We do the demonstration for air shows and stuff and him and I were sitting there talking\n\n3:49:32.460 --> 3:49:39.620\n and he was giving me the whole story and how it really changed his look on life that we're\n\n3:49:39.620 --> 3:49:42.700\n only here for a finite time and that we're all going to die.\n\n3:49:42.700 --> 3:49:46.300\n Well, unfortunately, after all that, when it was really going, him and his wife had\n\n3:49:46.300 --> 3:49:50.880\n moved to a location that would fit their, you know, close to the water where they could\n\n3:49:50.880 --> 3:49:56.500\n do stuff and I won't say where, and he was doing what he loved to do and he got diagnosed\n\n3:49:56.500 --> 3:50:00.540\n with throat cancer.\n\n3:50:00.540 --> 3:50:08.460\n And I was talking to him, uh, it was probably about maybe two months before he died, um,\n\n3:50:08.460 --> 3:50:13.980\n and I said, dude, hey, you're sad, I mean, this is your friend and I'm kind of really\n\n3:50:13.980 --> 3:50:18.580\n bummed out and this is the guy, this is a guy that's dying of cancer and here's what\n\n3:50:18.580 --> 3:50:19.580\n he tells me.\n\n3:50:19.580 --> 3:50:23.500\n He says, Dave, dude, we're all going to die.\n\n3:50:23.500 --> 3:50:28.540\n He goes, but I have to look at it, I have to make the best of the time that I have.\n\n3:50:28.540 --> 3:50:30.460\n And I said, I understand that.\n\n3:50:30.460 --> 3:50:37.860\n And he goes, with the exception of not being with my wife, who he loved dearly, he goes,\n\n3:50:37.860 --> 3:50:39.420\n I'm okay with dying.\n\n3:50:39.420 --> 3:50:47.980\n I've had a really good life and, um, about, uh, cause actually the original announcement\n\n3:50:47.980 --> 3:50:51.180\n when he, when he finally passed away, a buddy of mine called me cause I don't do Facebook\n\n3:50:51.180 --> 3:50:57.560\n and his wife had put it on Facebook that he had passed and about the day before he died,\n\n3:50:57.560 --> 3:51:03.900\n for some reason I was thinking about him and I had a dream or I think it was a dream or\n\n3:51:03.900 --> 3:51:04.900\n an altered reality.\n\n3:51:04.900 --> 3:51:11.700\n You can get into whatever, uh, but he was there, it was just him and I, and I was really\n\n3:51:11.700 --> 3:51:13.420\n sad in the dream.\n\n3:51:13.420 --> 3:51:16.220\n I was actually crying and he was there and he was actually in his uniform.\n\n3:51:16.220 --> 3:51:20.700\n He was in his whites and uh, cause he was a Navy and we were just talking and he looked\n\n3:51:20.700 --> 3:51:22.700\n at me and he said, and this isn't my dream.\n\n3:51:22.700 --> 3:51:25.740\n He's like, Dave, it's all going to be okay.\n\n3:51:25.740 --> 3:51:28.700\n And this is, this is like, and this is a vivid conversation I have.\n\n3:51:28.700 --> 3:51:32.660\n There's people are gonna think I'm weird about this, but, um, but I, you know, I know what\n\n3:51:32.660 --> 3:51:37.620\n my dream was and you know, maybe it's my subconscious creating the dream, but in reality to me,\n\n3:51:37.620 --> 3:51:40.780\n this was real, that it was put there for a reason.\n\n3:51:40.780 --> 3:51:43.700\n He's and he basically explained everything he's, it's okay.\n\n3:51:43.700 --> 3:51:45.220\n I'm going to be fine.\n\n3:51:45.220 --> 3:51:46.220\n My wife is fine.\n\n3:51:46.220 --> 3:51:50.320\n He goes, this is, this is what's meant to be, you know, but you know, and the bottom\n\n3:51:50.320 --> 3:51:54.700\n line was make use of every day that you have because you don't know.\n\n3:51:54.700 --> 3:51:57.820\n And literally two days later, I find out that he passed.\n\n3:51:57.820 --> 3:52:04.140\n Um, so, but ultimately he accepted the finiteness of it.\n\n3:52:04.140 --> 3:52:05.140\n He did.\n\n3:52:05.140 --> 3:52:08.620\n Well, you have to, and it's like, I talk about, you know, money and job position and this\n\n3:52:08.620 --> 3:52:11.660\n and that, and I said, you can get in any, you know, you can go to a company.\n\n3:52:11.660 --> 3:52:15.060\n Just remember when you want to be a VP of a company, you sell your soul to the company.\n\n3:52:15.060 --> 3:52:20.060\n You have to, I said, if you look, I joke with people at work and I said, I said, you know,\n\n3:52:20.060 --> 3:52:22.660\n when you ever think that you're important or this guy has that, I said, when you're\n\n3:52:22.660 --> 3:52:27.420\n sitting on 93 or 95, one 28 and you're sitting in traffic and we're stopped, which doesn't\n\n3:52:27.420 --> 3:52:29.660\n happen right now because of COVID, but normally it's stopped.\n\n3:52:29.660 --> 3:52:33.660\n It's bumper to bumper and you're sitting here like I was coming down here by the gas tank.\n\n3:52:33.660 --> 3:52:38.800\n Um, when you're sitting there, look left and look right, you know, and there can be a Lamborghini\n\n3:52:38.800 --> 3:52:40.760\n or an S five 50 Mercedes.\n\n3:52:40.760 --> 3:52:44.760\n And on the other side, there could be some piece of crap car.\n\n3:52:44.760 --> 3:52:48.840\n We're all sitting on the same freeway at the same time, trying to do the same thing, which\n\n3:52:48.840 --> 3:52:54.380\n is just get home so we can be with our family because the most important thing that we have,\n\n3:52:54.380 --> 3:52:55.380\n it ain't money.\n\n3:52:55.380 --> 3:52:56.480\n It ain't our job.\n\n3:52:56.480 --> 3:52:57.480\n It's not our position.\n\n3:52:57.480 --> 3:53:02.620\n I go, cause when it's all said and done, you could be, you know, you can be with the exception\n\n3:53:02.620 --> 3:53:04.300\n of the presidents of the United States.\n\n3:53:04.300 --> 3:53:07.260\n I mean, name the vice presidents.\n\n3:53:07.260 --> 3:53:11.400\n Most people can't and eventually they're going to die or eventually you're going to see a\n\n3:53:11.400 --> 3:53:15.180\n statue of a guy from the 17 hundreds in the Boston area and you're going to go, I don't\n\n3:53:15.180 --> 3:53:17.140\n even know who that guy was.\n\n3:53:17.140 --> 3:53:18.180\n Did he impact my life?\n\n3:53:18.180 --> 3:53:23.520\n He probably did, but eventually people forget you realize what's important now and the one\n\n3:53:23.520 --> 3:53:29.580\n thing that you have is your family and your close friends and that's, that's it.\n\n3:53:29.580 --> 3:53:31.360\n You can take all the money or everything else.\n\n3:53:31.360 --> 3:53:34.740\n If you're down on your luck, you know, who is going to be, we, I just joke, who are your\n\n3:53:34.740 --> 3:53:36.220\n true friends?\n\n3:53:36.220 --> 3:53:37.220\n It's the person.\n\n3:53:37.220 --> 3:53:39.900\n Well, there's, there's a once that I won't say, but you know, Hey, you're broke down\n\n3:53:39.900 --> 3:53:43.380\n on a road in the middle of nowhere and it's three oclock in the morning, who you going\n\n3:53:43.380 --> 3:53:47.000\n to call is going to get in their car without complaining and come and get you.\n\n3:53:47.000 --> 3:53:48.040\n And that's life.\n\n3:53:48.040 --> 3:53:49.040\n That is life.\n\n3:53:49.040 --> 3:53:50.900\n The people you love.\n\n3:53:50.900 --> 3:53:53.420\n It's it's, it's the people you truly care about.\n\n3:53:53.420 --> 3:53:57.980\n And contrary to, I have, you know, Oh my God, I got 6,000 Facebook friends.\n\n3:53:57.980 --> 3:54:02.060\n You got about that many real friends that you can count on and that's it.\n\n3:54:02.060 --> 3:54:03.060\n Everything else doesn't matter.\n\n3:54:03.060 --> 3:54:04.060\n Oh, it doesn't matter.\n\n3:54:04.060 --> 3:54:05.060\n It doesn't mean you don't be nice.\n\n3:54:05.060 --> 3:54:08.040\n I mean, I have, there's acquaintance friends that I'll do anything for and they can come\n\n3:54:08.040 --> 3:54:12.180\n to my house and stuff, but then there's the people that, you know, you know, like my cousins\n\n3:54:12.180 --> 3:54:19.000\n who are like my brothers that, you know, at a moment's notice, you know, when, when my\n\n3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:23.200\n uncle passed away at a young age, you know, who lived literally right down the street\n\n3:54:23.200 --> 3:54:28.580\n from me and my cousin Chad and I got two boys, there's 14 of us, but there's only two boys.\n\n3:54:28.580 --> 3:54:32.140\n There's three of us together and we all grew up in the same neighborhood, same schools,\n\n3:54:32.140 --> 3:54:33.940\n play football together, all that.\n\n3:54:33.940 --> 3:54:38.080\n I said, if one of those, if rare Chad ever needs me, if something happens like when my\n\n3:54:38.080 --> 3:54:41.580\n uncle died, it wasn't a, it wasn't an issue if I'm coming home.\n\n3:54:41.580 --> 3:54:44.580\n Because I'm booking the ticket and I don't give a shit what it costs because I will be\n\n3:54:44.580 --> 3:54:47.660\n there to be there with you.\n\n3:54:47.660 --> 3:54:54.420\n And then those two guys and my college roommate is another one that I'm very, very close with,\n\n3:54:54.420 --> 3:54:59.460\n you know, you know, if there's, there's, I have a handful of people that, you know, I\n\n3:54:59.460 --> 3:55:01.340\n will drop literally everything.\n\n3:55:01.340 --> 3:55:05.980\n Even if my wife would be pissed at me at times, she's like, seriously, I got to do it.\n\n3:55:05.980 --> 3:55:08.380\n And now she knows, and it's the same thing with her.\n\n3:55:08.380 --> 3:55:12.140\n I mean, she knows that there are certain people in her life that if they really need her and\n\n3:55:12.140 --> 3:55:16.540\n she has to go, she would go and I would let her go.\n\n3:55:16.540 --> 3:55:24.220\n So given all that, I'm honored that you would come here and talk to me and take the time.\n\n3:55:24.220 --> 3:55:26.580\n Dave was one of the best conversations I've ever had.\n\n3:55:26.580 --> 3:55:27.580\n Thank you so much.\n\n3:55:27.580 --> 3:55:28.580\n It's a pretty long one.\n\n3:55:28.580 --> 3:55:31.420\n It's probably sets the record for the longest one.\n\n3:55:31.420 --> 3:55:35.660\n So I, I mean, I'm, I'm a loss of words.\n\n3:55:35.660 --> 3:55:36.660\n One of my favorite conversations.\n\n3:55:36.660 --> 3:55:38.660\n Thank you so much for talking to me, Dave.\n\n3:55:38.660 --> 3:55:40.220\n You're welcome.\n\n3:55:40.220 --> 3:55:42.820\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Fravor.\n\n3:55:42.820 -->
