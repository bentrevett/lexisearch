you think they saw what they say they saw?\n\n00:09.760 --> 00:12.040\n It didn't just start showing up in 1947.\n\n00:12.040 --> 00:13.720\n How hard do you think it is for aliens\n\n00:13.720 --> 00:15.080\n to communicate with humans?\n\n00:15.080 --> 00:15.920\n What do we believe in?\n\n00:15.920 --> 00:16.760\n We believe in technology.\n\n00:16.760 --> 00:20.160\n So you show yourself as a form of technology, right?\n\n00:20.160 --> 00:23.080\n But the common thread is you're not alone.\n\n00:24.020 --> 00:26.220\n And there's something else here with you.\n\n00:26.220 --> 00:31.220\n And there's something that's, as you said, watching you.\n\n00:31.920 --> 00:33.880\n You are a professor at Stanford\n\n00:33.880 --> 00:36.260\n studying the biology of the human organism\n\n00:36.260 --> 00:38.640\n at the level of individual cells.\n\n00:38.640 --> 00:42.120\n So let me ask first the big,\n\n00:42.120 --> 00:43.740\n ridiculous philosophical question.\n\n00:43.740 --> 00:47.000\n What is the most beautiful or fascinating aspect\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:50.000\n of human biology at the level of the cell to you?\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:52.800\n The micromachines and the nanomachines\n\n00:52.800 --> 00:54.560\n that proteins make and become,\n\n00:54.560 --> 00:56.760\n that to me is the most interesting.\n\n00:56.760 --> 01:01.760\n The fact that you have this basically dynamic computer\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:04.600\n within every cell that's constantly processing\n\n01:04.600 --> 01:08.400\n its environment, and at the heart of it is DNA,\n\n01:08.400 --> 01:12.760\n which is a dynamic machine, a dynamic computation process.\n\n01:12.760 --> 01:16.640\n People think of the DNA as a linear code.\n\n01:16.640 --> 01:18.600\n It's codes within codes within codes.\n\n01:18.600 --> 01:21.920\n And it is actually the epigenetic state\n\n01:21.920 --> 01:23.920\n that's doing this amazing processing.\n\n01:23.920 --> 01:26.320\n I mean, if you ever wanted to believe in God,\n\n01:26.320 --> 01:28.240\n just look inside the cell.\n\n01:28.240 --> 01:30.820\n So DNA is both information and computer.\n\n01:30.820 --> 01:32.180\n Exactly.\n\n01:32.180 --> 01:34.840\n How did that computer come about?\n\n01:34.840 --> 01:37.280\n A big continuing on the philosophical question.\n\n01:37.280 --> 01:39.440\n Is this both scientific and philosophical?\n\n01:39.440 --> 01:42.360\n How did life originate on Earth, do you think?\n\n01:42.360 --> 01:46.540\n How did this, at every level, so the very first step\n\n01:46.540 --> 01:50.920\n and the fascinating complex computer that is DNA,\n\n01:50.920 --> 01:52.560\n that is multicellular organism,\n\n01:52.560 --> 01:56.120\n and then maybe the fascinating complex computer\n\n01:56.120 --> 01:58.740\n that is the human mind?\n\n01:58.740 --> 02:01.040\n Well, I think you have to take just one more step back\n\n02:01.040 --> 02:04.360\n to the complex computer that is the universe, right?\n\n02:04.360 --> 02:08.320\n All of the so called particles or the waves\n\n02:08.320 --> 02:10.240\n that people think the universe is made of\n\n02:10.240 --> 02:14.560\n and appears, to me at least, to be a computational process.\n\n02:14.560 --> 02:18.160\n And embedded in that is biology, right?\n\n02:18.160 --> 02:21.060\n So all the atoms of a protein, et cetera,\n\n02:21.060 --> 02:23.640\n sit in that computational matrix.\n\n02:23.640 --> 02:26.160\n From my point of view, it's computing something.\n\n02:26.160 --> 02:28.300\n It's computing towards something.\n\n02:28.300 --> 02:31.440\n It was created, in some ways, if you want to believe in God,\n\n02:31.440 --> 02:32.520\n and I don't know that I do,\n\n02:32.520 --> 02:35.000\n but if you want to believe in something,\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:38.000\n the universe was created or at least enabled\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:40.880\n to allow for life to form.\n\n02:40.880 --> 02:45.280\n And so the DNA, if you ask, where does DNA come from?\n\n02:45.280 --> 02:47.200\n And you can go all the way back to Richard Dawkins\n\n02:47.200 --> 02:50.720\n and the selfish gene hypothesis.\n\n02:50.720 --> 02:52.640\n The way I look at DNA, though,\n\n02:52.640 --> 02:56.280\n is it is not a moment in time.\n\n02:56.280 --> 02:59.520\n It assumes the context of the body and the environment\n\n02:59.520 --> 03:00.720\n in which it's going to live.\n\n03:00.720 --> 03:04.080\n And so if you want to ask a question of where\n\n03:04.080 --> 03:07.340\n and how does information get stored,\n\n03:07.340 --> 03:10.880\n DNA, although it's only 3 billion base pairs long,\n\n03:10.880 --> 03:14.000\n contains more information than, I think,\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:18.200\n the entire computational memory resources\n\n03:18.200 --> 03:20.240\n of our current technology.\n\n03:20.240 --> 03:24.440\n Because who and what you are is both what you were as an egg\n\n03:24.440 --> 03:27.640\n all the way through to the day you die,\n\n03:27.640 --> 03:29.640\n and it embodies all the different cell types\n\n03:29.640 --> 03:31.660\n and organs in your body.\n\n03:31.660 --> 03:36.480\n And so it's a computational reservoir\n\n03:36.480 --> 03:40.680\n of information and expectation that you will become.\n\n03:40.680 --> 03:43.720\n So actually, I would sort of turn it around a different way\n\n03:43.720 --> 03:46.480\n and say, if you wanted to create\n\n03:46.480 --> 03:50.560\n the best memory storage system possible,\n\n03:50.560 --> 03:53.320\n you could reverse engineer what a human is\n\n03:53.320 --> 03:56.520\n and create a DNA memory system\n\n03:56.520 --> 03:59.840\n that is not just the linear version,\n\n03:59.840 --> 04:03.320\n but is also everything that it could become.\n\n04:03.320 --> 04:04.280\n When we're talking about DNA,\n\n04:04.280 --> 04:06.960\n we're talking about Earth and the environment creating DNA.\n\n04:06.960 --> 04:09.840\n So you're talking about trying to come up\n\n04:09.840 --> 04:12.860\n with an optimal computer for this particular environment.\n\n04:12.860 --> 04:13.700\n Right.\n\n04:13.700 --> 04:17.920\n So if you were to reverse engineer that computer,\n\n04:19.340 --> 04:21.060\n what do you mean by considering\n\n04:21.060 --> 04:22.940\n all the possible things it could become?\n\n04:22.940 --> 04:24.780\n So who you are today, right?\n\n04:24.780 --> 04:27.540\n So 3 billion bits of information\n\n04:27.540 --> 04:31.660\n does not explain Lex Friedman, doesn't explain me, right?\n\n04:31.660 --> 04:35.420\n But the DNA embodies the expectation\n\n04:35.420 --> 04:40.040\n of the environment in which you will live and grow\n\n04:40.040 --> 04:41.380\n and become.\n\n04:41.380 --> 04:44.660\n So all the information that is you, right,\n\n04:44.660 --> 04:48.460\n is actually not only embedded in the DNA,\n\n04:48.460 --> 04:50.060\n but it's embedded in the context\n\n04:50.060 --> 04:55.060\n of the world in which you grow into and develop, right?\n\n04:55.660 --> 04:57.500\n But so all that information though\n\n04:57.500 --> 05:01.740\n is packed in the expectation of what the DNA expects to see.\n\n05:01.740 --> 05:02.580\n Interesting.\n\n05:02.580 --> 05:04.880\n So like some of the information,\n\n05:04.880 --> 05:08.260\n is that accurate to say is stored outside the body?\n\n05:08.260 --> 05:09.860\n Exactly, yeah.\n\n05:09.860 --> 05:11.300\n The information is stored outside\n\n05:11.300 --> 05:13.780\n because there's a context of expectation.\n\n05:13.780 --> 05:14.660\n Isn't that interesting?\n\n05:14.660 --> 05:15.740\n Yeah, it's fascinating.\n\n05:15.740 --> 05:20.380\n I mean, to linger on this point,\n\n05:20.380 --> 05:24.460\n if we were to run Earth over again a million times,\n\n05:24.460 --> 05:26.100\n how many different versions\n\n05:26.100 --> 05:28.060\n of this type of computer would we get?\n\n05:28.060 --> 05:29.860\n I think it would be different each time.\n\n05:29.860 --> 05:33.100\n I mean, if you assume there's no such thing as fate, right,\n\n05:33.100 --> 05:35.340\n and it's not all pre programmed,\n\n05:35.340 --> 05:37.460\n and that there is some sort of, let's say,\n\n05:37.460 --> 05:40.340\n variation or randomness at the beginning,\n\n05:40.340 --> 05:43.860\n you would get as many different versions of life\n\n05:43.860 --> 05:45.380\n as you could imagine.\n\n05:45.380 --> 05:46.940\n And I don't think it would all be\n\n05:46.940 --> 05:50.540\n unless there's something built into the substrate\n\n05:50.540 --> 05:51.380\n of the universe.\n\n05:51.380 --> 05:55.780\n It wouldn't always be left handed proteins, right?\n\n05:55.780 --> 05:58.420\n But I wonder what the flap of a butterfly wing,\n\n05:58.420 --> 06:01.260\n what effects it has,\n\n06:01.260 --> 06:04.660\n because it's possible that this system\n\n06:04.660 --> 06:07.220\n is really good at finding the efficient answer,\n\n06:07.220 --> 06:11.580\n and maybe the efficient answer is,\n\n06:11.580 --> 06:13.460\n there's only a small finite set of them\n\n06:13.460 --> 06:14.820\n for this particular environment.\n\n06:14.820 --> 06:16.020\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n06:16.020 --> 06:19.340\n That's the kind of, in a way, the anthropomorphic universe\n\n06:19.340 --> 06:21.460\n of the multiverse expectations, right?\n\n06:21.460 --> 06:24.860\n That there's probably a zillion other kinds of universes\n\n06:24.860 --> 06:28.500\n out there if you believe in multiverse theory.\n\n06:28.500 --> 06:32.500\n We only live in the ones where the rules are such\n\n06:32.500 --> 06:35.900\n that lifelike hours can exist.\n\n06:35.900 --> 06:39.220\n So using that logic, how many alien civilizations\n\n06:39.220 --> 06:40.500\n do you think are out there?\n\n06:40.500 --> 06:45.500\n There's like trillions of environments, aka planets,\n\n06:48.340 --> 06:51.780\n or maybe you can think even bigger than planets.\n\n06:51.780 --> 06:55.060\n How many lifelike organisms do you think\n\n06:55.060 --> 06:58.500\n are out there thriving, and maybe how many\n\n06:58.500 --> 07:01.860\n do you think are long gone, but were once here?\n\n07:01.860 --> 07:05.700\n I think, well, innumerable, I think in terms\n\n07:05.700 --> 07:06.900\n of the present. Greater than zero.\n\n07:06.900 --> 07:08.380\n Much greater than zero.\n\n07:08.380 --> 07:09.780\n I mean, I would just be surprised.\n\n07:09.780 --> 07:12.980\n What a waste, right, of all that space just for us\n\n07:12.980 --> 07:14.540\n if we're never gonna get there.\n\n07:15.980 --> 07:19.780\n That would be my first way to think about it.\n\n07:19.780 --> 07:24.780\n But second, I mean, I remember when I was about\n\n07:25.900 --> 07:27.420\n seven or eight years old, and I would love\n\n07:27.420 --> 07:29.420\n if any of your listeners could find\n\n07:29.420 --> 07:31.380\n this National Geographic.\n\n07:31.380 --> 07:35.340\n I remember opening the page of the National Geographic.\n\n07:35.340 --> 07:37.980\n I was about, again, seven to 10 years old,\n\n07:37.980 --> 07:42.100\n and it was sort of a current picture of the universe.\n\n07:42.100 --> 07:45.540\n It was around probably 1968, 1969.\n\n07:45.540 --> 07:48.340\n I just remember looking at it and thinking,\n\n07:48.340 --> 07:53.100\n what kinds of empires have risen and fallen\n\n07:53.100 --> 07:57.980\n across that space that we'll never know about?\n\n07:57.980 --> 08:01.340\n And isn't that sad that we know nothing\n\n08:01.340 --> 08:03.620\n about something so grand?\n\n08:03.620 --> 08:08.060\n And so I've always been a reader of science fiction\n\n08:08.060 --> 08:11.660\n because I like the creative ideas\n\n08:11.660 --> 08:13.580\n of what people come up with.\n\n08:13.580 --> 08:16.260\n And I especially like science fiction writers\n\n08:16.260 --> 08:18.700\n that base it in good science,\n\n08:18.700 --> 08:21.300\n but base it also in evolution.\n\n08:21.300 --> 08:26.140\n That if you evolve a civilization from something\n\n08:26.140 --> 08:29.340\n lifelike, right, some sort of biology,\n\n08:29.340 --> 08:31.500\n its assumptions about the universe will come\n\n08:31.500 --> 08:36.500\n from the environment in which it grew up.\n\n08:36.540 --> 08:39.980\n So for instance, Larry Niven is a great writer,\n\n08:39.980 --> 08:43.420\n and he imagines different kinds of civilizations.\n\n08:43.420 --> 08:48.100\n In some cases, what happens if intelligence\n\n08:48.100 --> 08:50.900\n evolved from a herd animal, right?\n\n08:50.900 --> 08:53.420\n Would you lead from behind, right?\n\n08:53.420 --> 08:56.660\n Would you be, you know, in his case,\n\n08:56.660 --> 08:59.340\n one of them were the so called puppeteers.\n\n08:59.340 --> 09:03.460\n And to them, the moral imperative is cowardice.\n\n09:03.460 --> 09:07.500\n You put other people forward to run the risk for you, right?\n\n09:07.500 --> 09:11.260\n And so he writes entire books around that premise.\n\n09:11.260 --> 09:15.220\n There's another guy, Brin, David Brin is his name,\n\n09:15.220 --> 09:19.820\n and he writes the so called uplift universe books.\n\n09:19.820 --> 09:24.820\n And in those, he takes different intelligences,\n\n09:24.820 --> 09:28.540\n each from a different evolutionary background.\n\n09:28.540 --> 09:33.140\n And then he posits a civilization based around\n\n09:33.140 --> 09:34.940\n where and what they came from.\n\n09:36.020 --> 09:39.060\n And so to me, I mean, that's just fun.\n\n09:39.060 --> 09:42.060\n But I mean, back to your original question is\n\n09:42.060 --> 09:43.100\n how many are there?\n\n09:43.100 --> 09:47.100\n I think as many stars as we can see.\n\n09:47.100 --> 09:49.940\n Now, how many are currently there?\n\n09:49.940 --> 09:53.500\n I don't know, I mean, that's the whole question of,\n\n09:53.500 --> 09:55.780\n you know, how long can a civilization last\n\n09:55.780 --> 09:58.740\n before it runs out of steam?\n\n09:58.740 --> 10:02.060\n And you, for instance, does it just get bored\n\n10:02.060 --> 10:03.900\n or does it transcend to something else?\n\n10:03.900 --> 10:06.620\n Or does it say, I've seen enough and I'm done?\n\n10:06.620 --> 10:08.260\n What does running out of steam look like?\n\n10:08.260 --> 10:10.340\n It could be destroy itself or get bored.\n\n10:10.340 --> 10:13.340\n You know, or we've done everything we can\n\n10:13.340 --> 10:16.100\n and they just decide to stop.\n\n10:16.100 --> 10:17.940\n I don't know, I just don't know.\n\n10:17.940 --> 10:21.340\n It's that you all must worry that we stop reproducing\n\n10:21.340 --> 10:23.260\n or we slow down the reproduction rate\n\n10:23.260 --> 10:25.380\n to where the population can go to zero.\n\n10:25.380 --> 10:27.780\n We can go to zero and we can't and we collapse.\n\n10:27.780 --> 10:30.620\n I mean, so the only way to get around that\n\n10:30.620 --> 10:35.500\n is perhaps create enough machines with AI\n\n10:35.500 --> 10:36.580\n to take care of us.\n\n10:38.500 --> 10:40.140\n What could possibly go wrong?\n\n10:41.700 --> 10:44.940\n You've talked to people that told stories\n\n10:44.940 --> 10:46.340\n of UFO encounters.\n\n10:47.300 --> 10:50.060\n What is the most fascinating to you about the stories\n\n10:50.060 --> 10:53.380\n of these UFO encounters that you've heard\n\n10:53.380 --> 10:54.500\n that people have told you?\n\n10:54.500 --> 10:59.500\n The similarity of them, the uniformity of the stories.\n\n11:00.940 --> 11:02.780\n Now, I just wanna say upfront,\n\n11:04.180 --> 11:08.580\n a lot of people think that when I speculate,\n\n11:08.580 --> 11:11.980\n I believe something, that's not true, right?\n\n11:11.980 --> 11:14.060\n Speculation is just creativity.\n\n11:14.060 --> 11:16.380\n Speculation is the beginning of hypothesis.\n\n11:17.540 --> 11:21.220\n None of what I hear in terms of the anecdotes\n\n11:21.220 --> 11:24.380\n do I necessarily believe are they true?\n\n11:24.380 --> 11:26.580\n But I still find them fascinating to listen to\n\n11:26.580 --> 11:29.620\n because at some level they're still raw data\n\n11:29.620 --> 11:30.740\n and you have to listen.\n\n11:30.740 --> 11:35.740\n And once you start to hear the same story again and again,\n\n11:35.820 --> 11:37.900\n then you have to say, well, there might be something to it.\n\n11:37.900 --> 11:42.620\n I mean, maybe it's some kind of a Jungian background\n\n11:42.620 --> 11:44.500\n in the human mind and human consciousness\n\n11:44.500 --> 11:47.460\n that creates these stories again and again\n\n11:47.460 --> 11:48.900\n as coming out of the DNA,\n\n11:48.900 --> 11:51.700\n it's coming out of that pre programmed something.\n\n11:51.700 --> 11:54.300\n And Jung talked quite a bit about this kind of thing.\n\n11:54.300 --> 11:56.420\n The collective unconscious.\n\n11:56.420 --> 11:58.780\n But actually one of the most interesting ones I find\n\n11:58.780 --> 12:03.140\n is this constant message\n\n12:03.140 --> 12:07.300\n that you're not taking care of your world.\n\n12:07.300 --> 12:11.580\n And this came long before climate change.\n\n12:11.580 --> 12:15.420\n It came long before many kinds of,\n\n12:15.420 --> 12:19.660\n let's say current day memes around\n\n12:19.660 --> 12:24.660\n taking care of our planet, pollution, et cetera.\n\n12:25.100 --> 12:28.180\n And so, for instance, perhaps the best example of this,\n\n12:28.180 --> 12:30.220\n the one that I find the most fascinating\n\n12:30.220 --> 12:35.220\n is a story out of Zimbabwe, 50 or 60 children,\n\n12:35.500 --> 12:39.660\n one afternoon in Zimbabwe.\n\n12:39.660 --> 12:43.900\n It was a well educated group of white and black children\n\n12:43.900 --> 12:48.900\n who had lunchtime in the playground, saw a craft\n\n12:49.540 --> 12:50.900\n and they saw little men.\n\n12:51.740 --> 12:53.580\n And they all ran into the teachers\n\n12:53.580 --> 12:56.900\n and they told the same story and they drew the same pictures.\n\n12:56.900 --> 13:00.380\n And the message several of them got was\n\n13:00.380 --> 13:02.340\n you are not taking care of your planet.\n\n13:03.340 --> 13:06.980\n And it got, you know, there's actually a movie coming out\n\n13:06.980 --> 13:11.300\n on this episode and 30 years later now,\n\n13:11.300 --> 13:13.020\n the people who were there, the children\n\n13:13.020 --> 13:16.220\n who've now grown up say, it happened to us.\n\n13:16.220 --> 13:18.260\n Now, did it happen?\n\n13:18.260 --> 13:20.780\n Was it some sort of hallucination\n\n13:20.780 --> 13:23.820\n or was it an imposed hallucination by something?\n\n13:23.820 --> 13:24.860\n Was it material?\n\n13:24.860 --> 13:29.860\n I don't know, but these kids were seven to 10 years old.\n\n13:30.380 --> 13:32.620\n You see them on video.\n\n13:32.620 --> 13:35.500\n Seven to 10 year olds can't lie like that.\n\n13:35.500 --> 13:39.500\n And so, you know, whether it's real or not, I don't know,\n\n13:39.500 --> 13:41.580\n but I find that fascinating data.\n\n13:41.580 --> 13:45.780\n And again, it's these unconnected stories\n\n13:45.780 --> 13:50.140\n of individuals with the same story.\n\n13:50.980 --> 13:55.980\n That is worthy of further inquiry.\n\n13:56.700 --> 14:00.700\n Yeah, so here we are humans with limited cognitive capacities\n\n14:00.700 --> 14:02.020\n trying to make sense of the world,\n\n14:02.020 --> 14:04.260\n trying to understand what is real and not.\n\n14:04.260 --> 14:07.900\n We have this DNA that somehow in complex ways\n\n14:07.900 --> 14:09.460\n is interacting with the environment.\n\n14:09.460 --> 14:14.460\n And then we get these novel ideas\n\n14:16.460 --> 14:19.860\n that come from the populace.\n\n14:19.860 --> 14:24.300\n And then they make us wonder about what it all means.\n\n14:26.060 --> 14:27.380\n And so how to interpret it.\n\n14:27.380 --> 14:29.700\n If you think from an alien perspective,\n\n14:29.700 --> 14:34.540\n how would you communicate with other lifelike organisms?\n\n14:34.540 --> 14:38.780\n You perhaps have to find in points\n\n14:38.780 --> 14:43.420\n on this interaction between the DNA and its manifestations\n\n14:43.420 --> 14:46.300\n in terms of the human mind\n\n14:46.300 --> 14:49.260\n and how it interacts with the environment.\n\n14:49.260 --> 14:52.540\n So it gets some kind of, all right, what is this DNA?\n\n14:52.540 --> 14:55.660\n What does this environment have to get in somehow\n\n14:55.660 --> 14:59.300\n to like interact with it, to perturb the system\n\n14:59.300 --> 15:02.660\n to where these little ants, human like ants\n\n15:02.660 --> 15:05.660\n get like excited and figures and see stuff out.\n\n15:05.660 --> 15:08.900\n Yeah, it has, and then somehow steer them.\n\n15:09.740 --> 15:11.660\n First of all, for investigative purposes,\n\n15:11.660 --> 15:14.740\n understand like oftentimes to understand a system,\n\n15:14.740 --> 15:15.740\n you have to perturb it.\n\n15:15.740 --> 15:16.580\n Exactly, yeah.\n\n15:16.580 --> 15:19.420\n It's like poke at it to get excited or not.\n\n15:19.420 --> 15:23.700\n And then the other ways you want to,\n\n15:23.700 --> 15:25.460\n if you worry about them,\n\n15:25.460 --> 15:28.380\n you can steer in one direction or another.\n\n15:28.380 --> 15:31.140\n And this kind of idea that we're not taking care\n\n15:31.140 --> 15:34.860\n of our world, that's interesting.\n\n15:34.860 --> 15:36.660\n I mean, that's comforting, that's hopeful\n\n15:36.660 --> 15:39.620\n because that means the greater intelligence,\n\n15:39.620 --> 15:42.380\n which is what I would hope would want to take care of us.\n\n15:42.380 --> 15:44.900\n Like we want to take care of the gorillas\n\n15:44.900 --> 15:47.140\n in the national parks in Africa.\n\n15:47.140 --> 15:49.780\n Yeah, but we don't want to take care of cockroaches.\n\n15:49.780 --> 15:51.540\n So there's a line we draw.\n\n15:51.540 --> 15:53.420\n So you have to hope that.\n\n15:53.420 --> 15:55.660\n Right now we're a bunch of angry monkeys\n\n15:55.660 --> 15:59.420\n and maybe whatever these intelligences are,\n\n15:59.420 --> 16:00.940\n are also keeping an eye on us.\n\n16:01.860 --> 16:03.620\n That you don't want a bunch of,\n\n16:03.620 --> 16:06.020\n you don't want the angry monkey troop\n\n16:06.020 --> 16:08.860\n stomping around the local galactic arm.\n\n16:08.860 --> 16:11.740\n Do you think these folks are telling the truth?\n\n16:11.740 --> 16:15.740\n Do you think they saw what they say they saw?\n\n16:15.740 --> 16:19.140\n I think they saw what they said they saw,\n\n16:19.140 --> 16:22.420\n but I also think they saw what they were shown.\n\n16:22.420 --> 16:25.900\n I mean, if you go back to the whole notion of,\n\n16:25.900 --> 16:28.380\n okay, how long has this been around?\n\n16:28.380 --> 16:31.300\n It didn't just start showing up in 1947, right?\n\n16:31.300 --> 16:36.140\n There are stories going back into the 1800s\n\n16:36.140 --> 16:39.020\n of people who saw things in their farming,\n\n16:39.020 --> 16:40.780\n in their farm fields in the US.\n\n16:40.780 --> 16:45.780\n It's in local newspapers from the 1800s, it's fascinating.\n\n16:46.340 --> 16:48.860\n But if you can go even further back,\n\n16:48.860 --> 16:53.860\n so to your point of how would you as a higher intelligence\n\n16:54.140 --> 16:58.340\n represent yourself to a lesser intelligence?\n\n16:58.340 --> 17:01.980\n So let's go back to pre civilization.\n\n17:01.980 --> 17:05.420\n Maybe you show yourself as the spirits in the forest\n\n17:05.420 --> 17:08.340\n and you give messages through that.\n\n17:08.340 --> 17:10.860\n Once you get a little bit more civilized,\n\n17:10.860 --> 17:13.980\n then you show yourself as the gods and then you're God.\n\n17:13.980 --> 17:16.140\n Well, we don't believe in God anymore necessarily,\n\n17:16.140 --> 17:17.420\n not everybody does.\n\n17:17.420 --> 17:18.420\n So what do we believe in?\n\n17:18.420 --> 17:19.380\n We believe in technology.\n\n17:19.380 --> 17:22.820\n So you show yourself as a form of technology, right?\n\n17:22.820 --> 17:25.620\n But the common thread is you're not alone\n\n17:25.620 --> 17:28.780\n and there's something else here with you.\n\n17:28.780 --> 17:31.420\n And there's something that's, as you said, watching you\n\n17:31.420 --> 17:34.700\n and at least watching over your shoulder.\n\n17:35.780 --> 17:38.740\n But I think that like any good parent,\n\n17:38.740 --> 17:43.740\n you don't tell your student everything, you make them learn\n\n17:44.380 --> 17:46.300\n and learning requires mistakes\n\n17:46.300 --> 17:50.060\n because if you tell them everything, then they get lazy.\n\n17:50.060 --> 17:55.060\n You've looked at the brains of, or information coming\n\n17:56.500 --> 17:58.180\n from the brain of some of the people\n\n17:58.180 --> 17:59.860\n that have had UFO encounters.\n\n17:59.860 --> 18:01.820\n What's common about the brain of people\n\n18:01.820 --> 18:03.020\n who encounter UFOs?\n\n18:04.140 --> 18:07.940\n So the study started with a group of,\n\n18:07.940 --> 18:11.460\n let's say a cohort of individuals that were brought to me\n\n18:11.460 --> 18:16.140\n and their MRIs to ask about the damage\n\n18:16.140 --> 18:19.180\n that had been seen in these individuals.\n\n18:19.180 --> 18:21.220\n It turns out that the majority of those patients\n\n18:21.220 --> 18:24.100\n ended up being, as far as we can tell, Havana syndrome.\n\n18:24.100 --> 18:28.940\n And so for me at least, that part of the story ends\n\n18:28.940 --> 18:30.180\n in terms of the injury,\n\n18:30.180 --> 18:33.260\n it's likely almost all Havana syndrome.\n\n18:33.260 --> 18:36.580\n That's somebody else's problem now, that's not my problem.\n\n18:38.740 --> 18:41.900\n But when we were looking at the brains of these individuals,\n\n18:41.900 --> 18:44.140\n we noticed something right in the center\n\n18:44.140 --> 18:47.580\n of the basal ganglia in many of these individuals\n\n18:47.580 --> 18:49.300\n that at first we thought was damage.\n\n18:49.300 --> 18:54.300\n It was basically an enriched patch of MRI dense neurons\n\n18:56.060 --> 18:57.540\n that we thought was damage,\n\n18:57.540 --> 18:59.140\n but then it was showing up in everybody.\n\n18:59.140 --> 19:01.580\n And then we looked and we said, oh, it's actually not.\n\n19:01.580 --> 19:04.060\n The other readings on these MRIs showed\n\n19:04.060 --> 19:05.780\n that actually that's living tissue.\n\n19:06.820 --> 19:10.100\n That's actually the head of the caudate in the pitamen.\n\n19:10.100 --> 19:12.100\n And at the time, and I remember even asking\n\n19:12.100 --> 19:16.660\n a good friend of mine at Stanford, who was a psychiatrist,\n\n19:16.660 --> 19:18.380\n what does the basal ganglia do?\n\n19:18.380 --> 19:21.740\n He said, oh, the basal ganglia is just about movement\n\n19:21.740 --> 19:24.380\n and nerve and motor control.\n\n19:24.380 --> 19:27.900\n I said, well, that's odd because these other papers\n\n19:27.900 --> 19:30.140\n that we were reading at the time started to suggest\n\n19:30.140 --> 19:34.580\n that it was involved with higher intelligence\n\n19:34.580 --> 19:37.340\n and is actually downstream of the executive function\n\n19:38.340 --> 19:42.780\n and involved with intuition and planning.\n\n19:42.780 --> 19:44.380\n And then if you think about it,\n\n19:44.380 --> 19:46.700\n if you're gonna have motor control,\n\n19:46.700 --> 19:48.820\n which is centralized in one place,\n\n19:48.820 --> 19:52.180\n motor control requires knowledge of the environment.\n\n19:52.180 --> 19:55.820\n You don't wanna move something and hit the table.\n\n19:55.820 --> 19:57.620\n Or if you're walking across a room,\n\n19:57.620 --> 20:01.660\n you want to be aware and cognizant\n\n20:01.660 --> 20:03.660\n of what you might bump into.\n\n20:03.660 --> 20:06.900\n So obviously all of that planning\n\n20:08.940 --> 20:11.380\n requires access to all the senses.\n\n20:11.380 --> 20:14.460\n It requires access to your desires, memory,\n\n20:14.460 --> 20:16.380\n knowledge of where and what you want\n\n20:16.380 --> 20:18.540\n and desire to walk nearby.\n\n20:18.540 --> 20:20.780\n Like I used the example of if you're at a party,\n\n20:20.780 --> 20:22.940\n you wanna avoid that person, you like that person,\n\n20:22.940 --> 20:25.220\n the waiter is about to drop something.\n\n20:25.220 --> 20:28.500\n All without thinking, you maneuver.\n\n20:28.500 --> 20:31.020\n So that actually, all that planning is done\n\n20:31.020 --> 20:32.300\n in the basal ganglia.\n\n20:33.580 --> 20:36.620\n And it's actually now called the brain within the brain.\n\n20:36.620 --> 20:40.540\n It's a goal processing system.\n\n20:40.540 --> 20:43.380\n Subservient to executive function.\n\n20:43.380 --> 20:48.380\n So what we think we found there was not something\n\n20:48.460 --> 20:50.380\n which allows people to talk to UFOs.\n\n20:50.380 --> 20:55.380\n I mean, I think the UFO community took it a step too far.\n\n20:55.420 --> 21:00.020\n What I think we found was a form of higher\n\n21:00.020 --> 21:01.980\n functioning and processing.\n\n21:01.980 --> 21:03.620\n So what we then looked at,\n\n21:03.620 --> 21:05.700\n and this was the most fascinating part of it,\n\n21:05.700 --> 21:09.580\n we looked then at individuals in the families\n\n21:09.580 --> 21:14.220\n or those, let's say the index case individuals.\n\n21:14.220 --> 21:16.620\n And we found that it was actually in families.\n\n21:16.620 --> 21:20.140\n And more so, this is the most fascinating part.\n\n21:20.140 --> 21:24.260\n We've probably looked now at about 200 just random cases\n\n21:24.260 --> 21:27.540\n that you can download off of databases online.\n\n21:27.540 --> 21:31.020\n You don't see this higher connectivity.\n\n21:31.020 --> 21:34.580\n You only find it in what Kit Green would have called\n\n21:34.580 --> 21:37.100\n or has called higher functioning individuals.\n\n21:37.100 --> 21:42.100\n People who are, I mean, he called them savants.\n\n21:42.980 --> 21:47.100\n I don't have the means to, we haven't done the testing.\n\n21:47.100 --> 21:49.980\n But it turns out my family has it, right?\n\n21:49.980 --> 21:54.980\n We found it in me, my brother, my sister, my mother.\n\n21:55.100 --> 21:57.900\n We found it as well in other individuals,\n\n21:57.900 --> 21:59.980\n husband and wife pairs.\n\n21:59.980 --> 22:03.580\n So statistically, if you had a group of 20 individuals\n\n22:03.580 --> 22:06.260\n and you found two husband wife pairs, both of whom had it,\n\n22:06.260 --> 22:08.740\n and yet it's only found at about, we think,\n\n22:08.740 --> 22:11.020\n one in 200, one in 300 individuals.\n\n22:11.020 --> 22:13.140\n The fact that two individuals came together,\n\n22:14.220 --> 22:15.820\n two sets of individuals came together,\n\n22:15.820 --> 22:18.900\n both of whom had it, implied either\n\n22:18.900 --> 22:23.900\n a restricted breeding group or attraction.\n\n22:25.460 --> 22:29.620\n The reason why it seems to be in, let's say,\n\n22:29.620 --> 22:33.180\n so called experiencers or people who claim,\n\n22:33.180 --> 22:36.020\n if intuition is the ability to see something\n\n22:36.020 --> 22:36.860\n that other people don't,\n\n22:36.860 --> 22:40.260\n and I don't mean that in a paranormal sense,\n\n22:40.260 --> 22:42.700\n but being able to see something just in front of you\n\n22:42.700 --> 22:44.540\n that other people might just dismiss,\n\n22:45.540 --> 22:48.220\n well, maybe that's a function of a higher kind\n\n22:48.220 --> 22:53.220\n of intelligence to say, well, I'm not looking at an artifact.\n\n22:55.180 --> 22:58.020\n I'm not looking at something that I should just ignore.\n\n22:58.020 --> 23:00.420\n I'm seeing something and I recognize it for,\n\n23:00.420 --> 23:02.620\n not what it is, but that it is something\n\n23:02.620 --> 23:05.620\n different than what is normally found in my environment.\n\n23:06.660 --> 23:08.820\n Yeah, you know, I have a little bit of that.\n\n23:09.700 --> 23:13.700\n I seem to see the magic in a lot of moments.\n\n23:13.700 --> 23:16.540\n I have a deep, it's obviously, not obviously,\n\n23:16.540 --> 23:19.860\n but it seems to be chemical in nature\n\n23:19.860 --> 23:23.460\n that I just am excited about life.\n\n23:23.460 --> 23:25.220\n I love life.\n\n23:25.220 --> 23:26.620\n I love stupid things.\n\n23:26.620 --> 23:28.380\n It feels like I'm high a lot,\n\n23:28.380 --> 23:30.860\n on mushrooms or something like that,\n\n23:30.860 --> 23:32.660\n where you'd really appreciate that.\n\n23:32.660 --> 23:37.100\n So I'm able to detect something about the environment\n\n23:38.140 --> 23:40.460\n that maybe others don't, I don't know,\n\n23:40.460 --> 23:45.460\n but I seem to be over the top grateful to be alive\n\n23:45.460 --> 23:49.540\n for a lot of stupid reasons, and that's in there somewhere.\n\n23:49.540 --> 23:50.980\n I mean, it's kind of interesting\n\n23:50.980 --> 23:55.980\n because it really is true that our brains,\n\n23:56.620 --> 23:59.820\n the way we're brought up, but also the genetics\n\n23:59.820 --> 24:03.780\n enables us to see certain slices of the world,\n\n24:03.780 --> 24:08.780\n and some people are probably more receptive\n\n24:08.940 --> 24:12.420\n to anomalous information.\n\n24:12.420 --> 24:17.420\n They see the magic, the possibility in the novel thing\n\n24:18.700 --> 24:21.980\n as opposed to kind of finding the pattern\n\n24:21.980 --> 24:24.340\n of the common, of the regular.\n\n24:24.340 --> 24:27.380\n Some people are more, wait a minute, this is kind of weird.\n\n24:27.380 --> 24:28.740\n I mean, a lot of those people would probably\n\n24:28.740 --> 24:30.020\n become scientists too.\n\n24:30.020 --> 24:34.300\n Like, huh, there's this pattern happening\n\n24:34.300 --> 24:36.060\n over and over and over, and then something weird\n\n24:36.060 --> 24:41.020\n just happened, and then you get excited by that weirdness\n\n24:41.020 --> 24:44.260\n and start to pull the string and discover\n\n24:44.260 --> 24:46.220\n what is at the core of that weirdness.\n\n24:46.220 --> 24:51.220\n Perhaps, is that, maybe by way of question,\n\n24:53.060 --> 24:55.420\n how does the human perception system deal\n\n24:55.420 --> 24:57.740\n with anomalous information, do you think?\n\n24:57.740 --> 24:59.300\n Well, it first tries to classify it\n\n24:59.300 --> 25:00.940\n and get it out of the way.\n\n25:00.940 --> 25:04.340\n If it's not food, if it's not sex, right?\n\n25:04.340 --> 25:08.380\n If it's not in the way of my desires,\n\n25:08.380 --> 25:10.700\n or if it is in the way of my desires,\n\n25:10.700 --> 25:13.660\n then you focus on it.\n\n25:13.660 --> 25:16.820\n And so I think the question is\n\n25:16.820 --> 25:19.260\n how much spare processing power,\n\n25:19.260 --> 25:22.620\n how much CPU cycles do we spend\n\n25:22.620 --> 25:27.620\n on things that are not those core desires?\n\n25:28.260 --> 25:33.260\n What is the most kind of memorable, powerful\n\n25:35.180 --> 25:38.660\n UFO encounter report you ever heard?\n\n25:38.660 --> 25:40.460\n Just to you, on a personal level,\n\n25:40.460 --> 25:42.820\n like something that was really powerful.\n\n25:42.820 --> 25:45.060\n Well, I mentioned the Zimbabwe one.\n\n25:45.060 --> 25:47.380\n That's particularly interesting.\n\n25:47.380 --> 25:50.620\n And one that actually most people don't know about,\n\n25:50.620 --> 25:54.860\n but family driving down the highway,\n\n25:54.860 --> 25:59.860\n two little girls in the back, open glass topped car,\n\n26:00.740 --> 26:05.740\n and the little girls see a craft right over their car.\n\n26:06.380 --> 26:08.980\n This is in the middle of the day on a busy highway.\n\n26:10.140 --> 26:11.100\n The mother sees it.\n\n26:12.580 --> 26:16.380\n Nobody can, they look around, nobody else seems to see it.\n\n26:16.380 --> 26:19.900\n So the girls take out their camera, take a picture of it,\n\n26:19.900 --> 26:21.060\n and then they get home.\n\n26:22.140 --> 26:24.500\n They look at the picture.\n\n26:24.500 --> 26:28.220\n There's no craft, but there's a little object\n\n26:28.220 --> 26:31.980\n about 30 feet above their car or so,\n\n26:31.980 --> 26:36.340\n probably about three feet across, kind of star shaped.\n\n26:36.340 --> 26:39.300\n It's not the craft, but it's something else.\n\n26:39.300 --> 26:41.300\n Obviously there was something there.\n\n26:41.300 --> 26:42.780\n And so what were they seeing?\n\n26:42.780 --> 26:44.060\n Were they seeing a projection?\n\n26:44.060 --> 26:46.900\n Were they seeing, and why were only they seeing it?\n\n26:46.900 --> 26:51.900\n And the photograph was capturing something very different\n\n26:52.460 --> 26:55.460\n than what we're seeing, but they're still an object.\n\n26:55.460 --> 26:58.220\n Can you give a little bit of context?\n\n26:58.220 --> 26:59.700\n Is this from modern day?\n\n26:59.700 --> 27:00.540\n It's modern day.\n\n27:00.540 --> 27:01.380\n Oh yeah, they had a camera.\n\n27:01.380 --> 27:02.460\n I mean, they had a cell phone camera.\n\n27:02.460 --> 27:06.020\n And this is like a report provided.\n\n27:06.020 --> 27:08.540\n By the way, where is a central place to provide a report?\n\n27:08.540 --> 27:09.380\n Is this?\n\n27:09.380 --> 27:11.020\n Oh, there's a move on, but this isn't public.\n\n27:11.020 --> 27:12.660\n I've seen the picture.\n\n27:12.660 --> 27:14.540\n Oh, this is something you've directly interacted with.\n\n27:14.540 --> 27:16.780\n Yeah, yeah, I've seen the picture.\n\n27:16.780 --> 27:21.780\n So those moments like that, they captivate your mind.\n\n27:23.220 --> 27:24.060\n It's so different,\n\n27:24.060 --> 27:26.900\n and it doesn't fall into the standard story at all.\n\n27:26.900 --> 27:31.060\n But it also, but in another way, it's kind of a,\n\n27:31.060 --> 27:33.780\n it's a clear enunciation of this notion\n\n27:33.780 --> 27:36.300\n that when people see events,\n\n27:36.300 --> 27:37.900\n they don't all see the same thing.\n\n27:37.900 --> 27:40.380\n Now, we've heard this about traffic accidents.\n\n27:40.380 --> 27:42.860\n Different people will see the color of the car differently\n\n27:42.860 --> 27:44.500\n or the chain of events differently.\n\n27:44.500 --> 27:47.100\n And this tells you that memory isn't anywhere near\n\n27:47.100 --> 27:48.740\n what we think it is.\n\n27:48.740 --> 27:52.380\n But the issue around these so called UFO reports\n\n27:52.380 --> 27:56.420\n is that the same people will see a very different thing,\n\n27:56.420 --> 28:01.420\n almost as if whatever it is is projecting a,\n\n28:01.660 --> 28:04.260\n is projecting something into the mind\n\n28:04.260 --> 28:06.980\n rather than it being real, right?\n\n28:06.980 --> 28:09.820\n Rather than it being a real manifestation,\n\n28:09.820 --> 28:11.460\n material in front of you,\n\n28:11.460 --> 28:16.340\n it's actually almost some sort of an altered virtual reality\n\n28:16.340 --> 28:18.020\n that is imposed on you.\n\n28:18.020 --> 28:21.860\n I mean, I think the company Meta\n\n28:21.860 --> 28:23.820\n and all the virtual reality companies\n\n28:23.820 --> 28:26.500\n would love to have something like that, right?\n\n28:26.500 --> 28:27.820\n Where you don't have to actually wear something\n\n28:27.820 --> 28:31.500\n on your face to experience a virtual reality.\n\n28:31.500 --> 28:33.900\n What happens if you could just project it?\n\n28:33.900 --> 28:35.180\n Well, that's the fundamental question\n\n28:35.180 --> 28:37.140\n from an alien perspective.\n\n28:37.140 --> 28:40.180\n When you look at it, or as we humans look at ants,\n\n28:40.180 --> 28:43.340\n how does its perception system operate?\n\n28:43.340 --> 28:45.700\n So not only how does this thing's mind operate,\n\n28:45.700 --> 28:47.740\n how does the human mind operate,\n\n28:47.740 --> 28:50.580\n but how does their perception system operate\n\n28:50.580 --> 28:55.500\n so that we can stimulate the perception system properly\n\n28:55.500 --> 28:57.460\n to get them to think certain things.\n\n28:57.460 --> 29:02.460\n And so, that's a really important question.\n\n29:02.540 --> 29:06.940\n Humans think that the only way to communicate\n\n29:06.940 --> 29:11.940\n is in 3D or 4D space time, there's physical objects,\n\n29:12.140 --> 29:15.300\n or maybe you write things into some kind of language.\n\n29:15.300 --> 29:20.300\n But there could be just so much more richness\n\n29:22.340 --> 29:23.700\n in how you can communicate.\n\n29:23.700 --> 29:25.300\n And so, from an alien perspective,\n\n29:25.300 --> 29:28.020\n where somebody has much greater technological capabilities,\n\n29:28.020 --> 29:31.540\n you have to figure out how do I use the skills I have\n\n29:31.540 --> 29:35.500\n to stimulate the limited humans.\n\n29:35.500 --> 29:37.940\n Right, well, I mean, let's take the ants exam\n\n29:37.940 --> 29:38.940\n again as an example.\n\n29:38.940 --> 29:43.220\n Let's say that you wanted to make ants practical.\n\n29:43.220 --> 29:45.260\n You wanted to use them for something, right?\n\n29:45.260 --> 29:47.580\n You wanted to use them as a form of biological robot.\n\n29:47.580 --> 29:50.900\n Now, DARPA and other people have been trying\n\n29:50.900 --> 29:55.900\n to use insects for, turn them into biological robots.\n\n29:56.060 --> 29:58.700\n But if you wanted to, you would have to interact\n\n29:58.700 --> 30:02.180\n with their sense of smell, right?\n\n30:02.180 --> 30:05.540\n Their pheromone system that they use to interact\n\n30:05.540 --> 30:06.620\n with each other.\n\n30:06.620 --> 30:10.580\n So you would either create those molecules\n\n30:10.580 --> 30:12.020\n to talk to them, to make them do,\n\n30:12.020 --> 30:13.700\n I'm not saying talk to them as if they're intelligent,\n\n30:13.700 --> 30:16.860\n but talk to them to manipulate them in ways that you want.\n\n30:16.860 --> 30:19.420\n Or if you were advanced enough,\n\n30:19.420 --> 30:24.420\n you would use some sort of electromagnetic or other means\n\n30:24.460 --> 30:26.820\n to stimulate their neurons in ways\n\n30:26.820 --> 30:30.380\n that would accomplish the same goal as the pheromones,\n\n30:30.380 --> 30:33.300\n but by doing it in a sort of a telefactoring way.\n\n30:34.180 --> 30:37.900\n So let's say you wanted to telefactor with humans.\n\n30:37.900 --> 30:40.860\n You would interact with them.\n\n30:40.860 --> 30:42.580\n And this is, again, this is a technology\n\n30:42.580 --> 30:45.380\n which you could imagine possible.\n\n30:45.380 --> 30:47.380\n You could telefactor information\n\n30:47.380 --> 30:50.540\n into the sensory system of a human, right?\n\n30:50.540 --> 30:53.220\n But then each human is a little bit different.\n\n30:53.220 --> 30:56.020\n So either you know enough about them to tailor it\n\n30:56.020 --> 30:58.780\n to that individual, or you just basically take advantage\n\n30:58.780 --> 31:02.180\n of whatever the sensory net is that that individual has.\n\n31:02.180 --> 31:05.300\n So if you happen to be good at sound,\n\n31:05.300 --> 31:08.260\n or you happen to be a very visually inclined individual,\n\n31:08.260 --> 31:11.260\n then maybe the sensory information that you get\n\n31:11.260 --> 31:15.140\n that's most effective in terms of transmitting information\n\n31:15.140 --> 31:17.180\n would come through that portal.\n\n31:17.180 --> 31:19.780\n I think the aliens would need to figure out\n\n31:19.780 --> 31:22.700\n that humans value physical consistency.\n\n31:22.700 --> 31:25.140\n So we've discovered physics.\n\n31:25.140 --> 31:28.420\n So we want our perception to make sense.\n\n31:28.420 --> 31:30.580\n Maybe they don't, you know,\n\n31:30.580 --> 31:32.900\n that's not an obvious fact of perception,\n\n31:32.900 --> 31:37.140\n that you have to figure out what kind of things\n\n31:37.140 --> 31:39.140\n are humans used to observing\n\n31:39.140 --> 31:41.500\n in this particular environment of Earth,\n\n31:41.500 --> 31:44.860\n and how do we stimulate the perception system\n\n31:44.860 --> 31:47.980\n in a way that's not anomalous,\n\n31:47.980 --> 31:50.620\n or not too, it doesn't cross that threshold\n\n31:50.620 --> 31:53.540\n of just like, well, that's way too weird.\n\n31:53.540 --> 31:56.040\n So they have to, I mean, that's not obvious\n\n31:56.040 --> 31:58.420\n that that should be important.\n\n31:58.420 --> 32:02.380\n Maybe you wanna err on the side of anomaly,\n\n32:02.380 --> 32:04.020\n like lean into the weirdness.\n\n32:04.020 --> 32:06.780\n So communication is complicated.\n\n32:06.780 --> 32:09.620\n Well, that's why I always find this issue\n\n32:09.620 --> 32:13.820\n of people talking about the so called grays as interesting,\n\n32:13.820 --> 32:17.300\n because it is related to what you're saying.\n\n32:17.300 --> 32:19.460\n They're different enough,\n\n32:19.460 --> 32:22.380\n but they're not so different as to be scary, right?\n\n32:22.380 --> 32:25.540\n They're not venom dripping fangs, right?\n\n32:25.540 --> 32:27.860\n They're different enough,\n\n32:27.860 --> 32:32.220\n but it's also like they're what you could imagine\n\n32:32.220 --> 32:34.060\n us becoming in some distant future.\n\n32:34.060 --> 32:36.820\n So is that a purposeful representation?\n\n32:37.920 --> 32:38.760\n I don't know.\n\n32:38.760 --> 32:41.260\n I mean, I don't believe in the grays, for instance,\n\n32:41.260 --> 32:44.580\n but I believe that people think that they see it.\n\n32:44.580 --> 32:47.160\n So if we're talking about a communication strategy\n\n32:47.160 --> 32:50.320\n that says, you know, we're like you,\n\n32:50.320 --> 32:53.320\n but not the same as you,\n\n32:53.320 --> 32:57.660\n this might be a manifestation that you represent\n\n32:57.660 --> 32:59.720\n in terms of a communication strategy.\n\n33:00.660 --> 33:04.060\n What do you make of David's favorite sighting\n\n33:04.060 --> 33:06.300\n of the Tic Tac UFO,\n\n33:06.300 --> 33:09.540\n and other pilots who have seen these objects\n\n33:09.540 --> 33:11.500\n that seem to defy the laws of physics?\n\n33:12.540 --> 33:15.720\n Well, I think you have to take them at their word.\n\n33:17.060 --> 33:18.140\n Are they fascinating to you?\n\n33:18.140 --> 33:18.980\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n33:18.980 --> 33:20.940\n No, I know a lot of these people, right?\n\n33:20.940 --> 33:24.620\n So I know Lou Elizondo, Chris Mellon,\n\n33:24.620 --> 33:26.340\n the whole crowd I've been,\n\n33:26.340 --> 33:30.500\n I saw the videos about three weeks or so\n\n33:30.500 --> 33:33.340\n before they went public.\n\n33:33.340 --> 33:38.220\n I was at a bar with Lou overlooking the Pentagon\n\n33:38.220 --> 33:40.160\n in Crystal City, and they showed them to me,\n\n33:40.160 --> 33:42.020\n and my hair stood on end.\n\n33:42.020 --> 33:45.360\n And he said, this is coming out soon.\n\n33:45.360 --> 33:49.340\n And I know one of the guys on the inside\n\n33:49.340 --> 33:51.380\n who was the Naval Intelligence\n\n33:51.380 --> 33:53.860\n who had interviewed all of these pilots again\n\n33:53.860 --> 33:55.540\n before this came out.\n\n33:55.540 --> 33:58.780\n And it was hair raising to hear this,\n\n33:58.780 --> 34:03.780\n but also exciting that here's not just people's testimony,\n\n34:04.460 --> 34:05.860\n these are credible individuals.\n\n34:05.860 --> 34:08.300\n And if you've seen the 60 minute episode\n\n34:08.300 --> 34:10.360\n with some of the pilots,\n\n34:11.620 --> 34:13.180\n they have no monetary gain.\n\n34:13.180 --> 34:16.960\n If anything, they've got negative gain from coming out.\n\n34:16.960 --> 34:19.700\n But then you also have all of those simultaneous\n\n34:21.060 --> 34:23.820\n ship analysis from the USS Princeton\n\n34:23.820 --> 34:26.260\n and the radar analysis, et cetera.\n\n34:26.260 --> 34:31.260\n So at the end of the day, it's just data.\n\n34:32.320 --> 34:33.820\n It's not a conclusion.\n\n34:35.300 --> 34:38.660\n I'd be perfectly happy, honestly, perfectly happy\n\n34:38.660 --> 34:41.300\n if somebody showed that it was all a hoax.\n\n34:41.300 --> 34:44.140\n I can go back to my day job, right?\n\n34:44.140 --> 34:47.820\n That could be a hoax, but other things might not be.\n\n34:47.820 --> 34:49.620\n This is the point.\n\n34:49.620 --> 34:53.060\n This is why it's nice to remove some of the stigma\n\n34:53.060 --> 34:55.540\n about this topic because it's all just data\n\n34:55.540 --> 35:00.540\n and anomalous events are such that they're going to be rare\n\n35:03.660 --> 35:05.860\n in terms of how much data they represent.\n\n35:05.860 --> 35:08.380\n But we have to consider the full range of data\n\n35:08.380 --> 35:11.540\n to discover the things that actually represent something\n\n35:11.540 --> 35:14.740\n that's, if we pull at it, we'll discover something\n\n35:14.740 --> 35:18.100\n that's extraterrestrial or something deep\n\n35:18.100 --> 35:21.980\n about the phenomena on Earth that we don't yet understand.\n\n35:21.980 --> 35:22.820\n Right.\n\n35:22.820 --> 35:26.400\n Well, if it only stimulates people, for instance,\n\n35:26.400 --> 35:29.380\n to think, okay, well, what happens if we could move\n\n35:29.380 --> 35:32.240\n like that with momentumless movement?\n\n35:32.240 --> 35:37.240\n And it stimulates young individuals to go into the sciences\n\n35:38.540 --> 35:40.940\n to ask those questions.\n\n35:40.940 --> 35:41.980\n That to me is fascinating.\n\n35:41.980 --> 35:44.580\n I mean, after I've been openly talking about this\n\n35:44.580 --> 35:47.420\n in the last year, especially, I've had a number\n\n35:47.420 --> 35:52.420\n of students from top schools who aren't my students\n\n35:52.500 --> 35:57.300\n come to me and say, if I can help, let me.\n\n35:57.300 --> 35:58.180\n How can I help?\n\n35:58.180 --> 35:59.620\n I never had thought about this before,\n\n35:59.620 --> 36:02.940\n but you opened, you and others, not just you and others,\n\n36:02.940 --> 36:06.260\n have opened my mind to thinking about this matter.\n\n36:06.260 --> 36:07.620\n Yeah, that's why it's actually funny\n\n36:07.620 --> 36:11.720\n that Elon Musk doesn't think too much about this,\n\n36:13.380 --> 36:15.540\n these kinds of propulsion systems that could defy\n\n36:15.540 --> 36:18.700\n the laws of physics as we currently understand them.\n\n36:18.700 --> 36:22.720\n To me, it's a powerful way to think what is possible.\n\n36:23.660 --> 36:26.660\n It's inspiring, even if some of the data\n\n36:26.660 --> 36:30.260\n doesn't represent extraterrestrial vehicles.\n\n36:30.260 --> 36:32.940\n I think the observation itself,\n\n36:32.940 --> 36:35.020\n it's like something you mentioned,\n\n36:35.020 --> 36:40.020\n which is hypothesizing, imagining these things,\n\n36:40.540 --> 36:43.360\n considering the possibility of these things,\n\n36:43.360 --> 36:45.780\n I think opens up your mind in a way\n\n36:45.780 --> 36:49.420\n that ultimately can create the technology.\n\n36:49.420 --> 36:52.140\n First, you have to believe the technology is possible\n\n36:52.140 --> 36:54.060\n before you can create it.\n\n36:54.060 --> 36:58.020\n In my own lab, we always look for,\n\n36:58.020 --> 37:00.880\n as I've said before, what is inevitable,\n\n37:00.880 --> 37:05.220\n and saying inevitably this is the kind of data we need,\n\n37:05.220 --> 37:06.540\n but if we need that kind of data,\n\n37:06.540 --> 37:10.780\n the instrument we want doesn't exist.\n\n37:10.780 --> 37:14.980\n Okay, so I imagine the perfect instrument, I can't make it,\n\n37:14.980 --> 37:18.300\n and you back into something which is practical,\n\n37:18.300 --> 37:22.500\n and then you, in a sense, reverse engineer the future\n\n37:22.500 --> 37:24.580\n of what it is that you wanna make.\n\n37:24.580 --> 37:28.540\n And I've started and sold at least half a dozen\n\n37:28.540 --> 37:32.420\n or more companies using that basic premise.\n\n37:32.420 --> 37:35.940\n And so it was always something that didn't exist today,\n\n37:35.940 --> 37:38.740\n but we imagined what we wanted.\n\n37:38.740 --> 37:41.980\n And at the time, many people said it couldn't be done.\n\n37:41.980 --> 37:43.720\n I mean, for instance, all the gene therapy\n\n37:43.720 --> 37:46.200\n that's done today with retroviruses\n\n37:46.200 --> 37:49.980\n came from a group meeting in David Baltimore's lab.\n\n37:49.980 --> 37:54.860\n I was a postdoc with him, and one of the other postdocs\n\n37:54.860 --> 37:58.060\n wasn't able to make retroviruses in a way\n\n37:58.060 --> 38:00.700\n that he wanted to, and I realized I had a cell line\n\n38:00.700 --> 38:02.820\n that would allow us to make retroviruses\n\n38:02.820 --> 38:04.780\n in two days rather than two months.\n\n38:05.620 --> 38:09.600\n And so he and I then worked together to make that system,\n\n38:09.600 --> 38:11.580\n and now all gene therapy with retroviruses\n\n38:11.580 --> 38:14.700\n is done using this basic approach around the whole world,\n\n38:14.700 --> 38:17.300\n because something couldn't be done,\n\n38:17.300 --> 38:22.100\n and we wanted to do it better, and we imagined the future.\n\n38:22.100 --> 38:27.100\n And so that's, I think, what the whole UFO phenomenon\n\n38:27.100 --> 38:28.100\n is doing for people.\n\n38:28.100 --> 38:29.900\n It's like, well, let's imagine a future\n\n38:30.940 --> 38:33.060\n where these kinds of technologies are,\n\n38:33.060 --> 38:34.260\n but also let's imagine a future\n\n38:34.260 --> 38:36.140\n where we don't blow ourselves up, right?\n\n38:36.140 --> 38:37.580\n So if these things are there,\n\n38:37.580 --> 38:39.480\n they manage to not blow themselves up.\n\n38:40.420 --> 38:44.740\n So it means that at least one other civilization\n\n38:44.740 --> 38:47.160\n got past the inflection point.\n\n38:47.160 --> 38:50.220\n So if some of the encounters are actually representing\n\n38:50.220 --> 38:52.560\n alien civilizations visiting us,\n\n38:52.560 --> 38:57.400\n why do you think they're doing so?\n\n38:57.400 --> 39:00.100\n You suggested that perhaps it's the study\n\n39:00.100 --> 39:02.900\n understand their own past, right?\n\n39:02.900 --> 39:05.340\n What are some of the motivations, do you think?\n\n39:05.340 --> 39:09.240\n And again, from our perspective, us as humans,\n\n39:09.240 --> 39:11.060\n what motivations would we have\n\n39:11.060 --> 39:12.960\n when we approach other civilizations\n\n39:12.960 --> 39:15.140\n we might discover in the future?\n\n39:15.140 --> 39:17.620\n Well, I think one motivation might be\n\n39:17.620 --> 39:22.340\n to steer us away from the precipice, right?\n\n39:22.340 --> 39:24.480\n Or on the assumption that,\n\n39:25.420 --> 39:27.580\n even if we make it past the precipice,\n\n39:27.580 --> 39:32.540\n at least we're not a bunch of psychopaths running around.\n\n39:32.540 --> 39:35.300\n So maybe there's a little bit of motivation there\n\n39:35.300 --> 39:38.140\n to make sure that the neighbor that's growing up next to you\n\n39:38.140 --> 39:40.520\n is not unruly.\n\n39:42.900 --> 39:46.460\n But I mean, maybe it's sort of a moral imperative,\n\n39:46.460 --> 39:52.900\n like what we have with creating national parks\n\n39:52.900 --> 39:56.620\n where animals can continue to live out their lives\n\n39:56.620 --> 39:57.780\n in a natural way.\n\n39:58.980 --> 39:59.900\n I don't know.\n\n39:59.900 --> 40:02.420\n I mean, that would be, I mean, the problem is\n\n40:02.420 --> 40:07.420\n we're imagining from a anthropomorphic viewpoint\n\n40:08.540 --> 40:10.260\n what an alien might think.\n\n40:10.260 --> 40:14.740\n And as I've said before, alien means alien, right?\n\n40:14.740 --> 40:17.580\n I mean, not Hollywood aliens,\n\n40:17.580 --> 40:21.300\n but a whole different way of thinking\n\n40:21.300 --> 40:23.620\n and a whole different level of experience\n\n40:23.620 --> 40:25.960\n and let's say wisdom, hopefully,\n\n40:27.020 --> 40:30.220\n that we could only hope to understand.\n\n40:30.220 --> 40:32.220\n Now, but if we ever get out there,\n\n40:32.220 --> 40:36.160\n if we ever make it past our current problems,\n\n40:37.100 --> 40:39.060\n and even if we don't have faster than light travel,\n\n40:39.060 --> 40:43.020\n and even if we're only using ram scoops\n\n40:43.020 --> 40:46.820\n or light sails to get where we wanna go,\n\n40:46.820 --> 40:50.620\n and it takes us 10,000 years to get somewhere\n\n40:50.620 --> 40:53.980\n or to spread out, we might encounter such things.\n\n40:53.980 --> 40:56.360\n And are we just gonna stomp all over it\n\n40:56.360 --> 41:00.500\n like we did in colonial South America or Africa\n\n41:00.500 --> 41:03.580\n or all the rest on our current path, likely?\n\n41:04.860 --> 41:06.580\n And so what are we gonna learn?\n\n41:06.580 --> 41:08.500\n Well, we're getting better and better\n\n41:08.500 --> 41:10.580\n at understanding what is life.\n\n41:10.580 --> 41:13.820\n And I think we're getting better and better\n\n41:13.820 --> 41:17.460\n at being careful, not to step on it when we see it.\n\n41:17.460 --> 41:19.740\n And this is one of the nice things\n\n41:19.740 --> 41:24.420\n about talking about UFOs is it expands the Overton window.\n\n41:24.420 --> 41:28.500\n It expands our understanding of what possibly could be life.\n\n41:28.500 --> 41:29.740\n It gets us to think.\n\n41:29.740 --> 41:32.060\n It gets the scientific community to think.\n\n41:32.060 --> 41:34.860\n When we go to Mars, when we go to these different moons\n\n41:34.860 --> 41:36.260\n that possibly have life,\n\n41:37.140 --> 41:40.280\n we're not looking at legged organisms.\n\n41:40.280 --> 41:44.140\n We're looking at some kind of complexity\n\n41:45.340 --> 41:50.340\n that arises in resistance to the natural world.\n\n41:51.860 --> 41:54.100\n And there's a lot of interesting.\n\n41:54.100 --> 41:57.300\n I like that, resistance to the natural world, yeah.\n\n41:57.300 --> 42:01.020\n So somehow there's a rebellious process,\n\n42:01.020 --> 42:03.380\n complex system going on here.\n\n42:03.380 --> 42:06.820\n And I don't know the many ways it could take form.\n\n42:06.820 --> 42:11.820\n There's a sense for aliens that as the technology develops,\n\n42:12.780 --> 42:16.820\n they take form more and more as information,\n\n42:16.820 --> 42:21.420\n as something that can influence the space of ideas,\n\n42:21.420 --> 42:24.840\n of the processing of data itself.\n\n42:24.840 --> 42:29.360\n So I just, this idea of embodiment that we humans so admire,\n\n42:30.180 --> 42:34.380\n physically visible, perceivable embodiment\n\n42:34.380 --> 42:39.380\n may be a very inefficient thing, right?\n\n42:39.700 --> 42:43.660\n If you think just about your area, AI,\n\n42:43.660 --> 42:48.020\n we're trying to make smaller and smaller and smaller\n\n42:49.140 --> 42:54.140\n circuitry that is basically closer and closer\n\n42:55.780 --> 43:00.440\n to the physics of how the universe operates, right?\n\n43:00.440 --> 43:02.700\n Right down at the level of, I mean, quantum computers\n\n43:02.700 --> 43:05.800\n are basically right down about quantum information storage.\n\n43:05.800 --> 43:10.540\n So fast forward 10,000, 100,000 years,\n\n43:10.540 --> 43:13.540\n maybe somebody found a way to embody AI directly\n\n43:13.540 --> 43:16.420\n into the physics of the universe, right?\n\n43:16.420 --> 43:19.620\n And it doesn't require a physical manifestation.\n\n43:19.620 --> 43:22.820\n It just sits in space time.\n\n43:22.820 --> 43:25.260\n It's just a locally ordered space.\n\n43:25.260 --> 43:28.780\n We're just locally ordered space time, right?\n\n43:28.780 --> 43:31.140\n You know, I mean, but maybe they just,\n\n43:31.140 --> 43:33.820\n they found a way to embody it there.\n\n43:33.820 --> 43:35.380\n They probably have to get really good\n\n43:35.380 --> 43:38.860\n at not, you know, trampling on the ants.\n\n43:38.860 --> 43:40.360\n The better your technology gets,\n\n43:40.360 --> 43:42.860\n the easier it is to accidentally like, oops,\n\n43:44.340 --> 43:48.000\n just destroy these simpleton biological systems.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:50.600\n We constantly think about whatever these things might be.\n\n43:50.600 --> 43:55.600\n We think that they are some sort of a unified force.\n\n43:56.140 --> 43:58.840\n Well, maybe they're not unified.\n\n43:58.840 --> 44:03.020\n Maybe they are as disparate as you and I are.\n\n44:03.020 --> 44:06.620\n And maybe what keeps them from stomping all over the ants\n\n44:06.620 --> 44:09.140\n is each other, right?\n\n44:09.140 --> 44:11.620\n That they are in a self tension\n\n44:11.620 --> 44:16.620\n to prevent one or more of them from running amok.\n\n44:17.940 --> 44:18.780\n Oh, yeah.\n\n44:18.780 --> 44:21.020\n I mean, that's kind of the anarchy of nations\n\n44:21.020 --> 44:21.840\n that we have on earth.\n\n44:21.840 --> 44:26.840\n So there's always going to be this.\n\n44:27.320 --> 44:28.160\n There's a hierarchy.\n\n44:28.160 --> 44:29.620\n This hierarchy that's formed\n\n44:29.620 --> 44:31.700\n of greater and greater intelligences.\n\n44:31.700 --> 44:34.500\n And they're all probably also wondering,\n\n44:34.500 --> 44:36.100\n wait, what's bigger than me?\n\n44:36.100 --> 44:36.940\n Exactly.\n\n44:36.940 --> 44:39.340\n That's what I always wonder is that maybe that they're,\n\n44:39.340 --> 44:43.740\n what keeps them in line is something that is beyond them.\n\n44:43.740 --> 44:45.240\n Like what created the universe.\n\n44:45.240 --> 44:48.560\n I mean, that's probably a question that bothers them too.\n\n44:50.360 --> 44:53.000\n What about the communication task itself?\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:54.780\n How hard do you think it is for aliens\n\n44:54.780 --> 44:56.280\n to communicate with humans?\n\n44:56.280 --> 45:00.340\n So is this something you think about\n\n45:00.340 --> 45:02.060\n about this barrier of communication\n\n45:02.060 --> 45:04.980\n between biological systems and something else?\n\n45:04.980 --> 45:07.620\n How difficult is it to find a common language?\n\n45:08.660 --> 45:11.220\n Well, I think if you're smart enough\n\n45:11.220 --> 45:13.780\n or technologically enabled enough,\n\n45:13.780 --> 45:16.660\n it's relatively straightforward.\n\n45:18.420 --> 45:21.740\n Now, whether your concepts\n\n45:21.740 --> 45:26.740\n can ever be dumbed down to us,\n\n45:27.240 --> 45:28.880\n that might be hard.\n\n45:30.120 --> 45:30.960\n I mean.\n\n45:30.960 --> 45:32.280\n Again, talking to the ants.\n\n45:32.280 --> 45:33.260\n Talking to the ants.\n\n45:33.260 --> 45:34.100\n I mean, they don't.\n\n45:34.100 --> 45:35.240\n On Instagram.\n\n45:35.240 --> 45:36.080\n So.\n\n45:38.320 --> 45:39.800\n You want to look good in this picture.\n\n45:39.800 --> 45:40.640\n Let me explain to you.\n\n45:40.640 --> 45:41.960\n Let me explain to you why.\n\n45:41.960 --> 45:42.800\n Yeah.\n\n45:44.200 --> 45:46.920\n So that's the essential problem of,\n\n45:46.920 --> 45:50.800\n you know, perhaps they realize\n\n45:51.680 --> 45:54.260\n who it is that they're talking to.\n\n45:54.260 --> 45:57.920\n And they say, rather than muddy the picture,\n\n45:57.920 --> 46:00.960\n we're only going to give them limited information.\n\n46:00.960 --> 46:01.800\n Yeah.\n\n46:01.800 --> 46:02.620\n Right?\n\n46:02.620 --> 46:04.380\n And yeah, maybe we could sit down,\n\n46:04.380 --> 46:06.600\n like you and I, and have a conversation.\n\n46:06.600 --> 46:09.080\n But then they would make assumptions.\n\n46:09.080 --> 46:10.800\n The humans would then make assumptions about us\n\n46:10.800 --> 46:12.020\n that aren't true.\n\n46:12.020 --> 46:13.920\n Because we're not humans, right?\n\n46:13.920 --> 46:17.360\n So let's stay at arm's length.\n\n46:17.360 --> 46:21.760\n Let's just let them know that we're here, right?\n\n46:21.760 --> 46:23.780\n And here's the limited amount of communication.\n\n46:23.780 --> 46:25.280\n Again, this notion that\n\n46:26.640 --> 46:29.340\n if you give somebody everything, they'll get lazy.\n\n46:30.520 --> 46:34.120\n And, you know, if they've been around as long as they have,\n\n46:34.120 --> 46:36.760\n they've seen every kind of thing that can go wrong.\n\n46:37.660 --> 46:42.660\n And so they know as much as they might want to step in,\n\n46:42.660 --> 46:44.420\n that that would be a wrong thing.\n\n46:45.660 --> 46:47.180\n Yeah, you have to also understand\n\n46:47.180 --> 46:50.300\n the amount of wisdom they carry.\n\n46:50.300 --> 46:51.140\n Yeah.\n\n46:52.340 --> 46:56.540\n You know, and so it's very easy as well for religions to,\n\n46:56.540 --> 46:58.780\n I don't want to get into a whole religious conversation,\n\n46:58.780 --> 47:00.780\n but it's very easy for,\n\n47:00.780 --> 47:04.220\n you could see how religions could call them angels\n\n47:04.220 --> 47:06.780\n or devils or what have you.\n\n47:06.780 --> 47:08.980\n Because, again, if you're trying to fit it\n\n47:08.980 --> 47:12.240\n into a framework of cultural understanding,\n\n47:12.240 --> 47:14.980\n the first thing you reach for is God.\n\n47:16.040 --> 47:21.040\n And so when you look at what these things are,\n\n47:21.300 --> 47:24.380\n and again, with the angels and the devils,\n\n47:24.380 --> 47:29.380\n in a similar sort of way, their communication is limited.\n\n47:29.460 --> 47:33.300\n They just kind of give little, what's the oracle of Delphi?\n\n47:33.300 --> 47:36.620\n They kind of give these Delphic pronouncements,\n\n47:36.620 --> 47:37.860\n and then it's up to you to figure out\n\n47:37.860 --> 47:39.500\n what it is that they really mean.\n\n47:39.500 --> 47:41.100\n Yeah.\n\n47:41.100 --> 47:45.220\n Steven Greer claimed that a skeleton discovered\n\n47:45.220 --> 47:50.100\n in Atacama region of Chile might be an alien.\n\n47:50.100 --> 47:53.740\n You reached out to him and took on the task\n\n47:53.740 --> 47:57.180\n of proving or disproving that with the rigor of science.\n\n47:57.180 --> 47:59.340\n The result is a paper titled\n\n47:59.340 --> 48:02.100\n Whole Genome Sequencing of Atacama Skeleton\n\n48:02.100 --> 48:05.480\n Shows Novel Mutations Linked with Dysplasia.\n\n48:06.320 --> 48:07.820\n Can you tell this full story?\n\n48:07.820 --> 48:12.820\n Well, the story was, as you put it right there, correct.\n\n48:13.980 --> 48:18.500\n Reached out, got a sample of the body,\n\n48:18.500 --> 48:22.440\n did the DNA sequencing, then worked with a team\n\n48:22.440 --> 48:25.080\n of two other Stanford scientists\n\n48:25.080 --> 48:30.080\n and Roche sequencing group, Roche Diagnostics,\n\n48:30.940 --> 48:33.580\n and probably a total team of about 11 or so people.\n\n48:33.580 --> 48:38.220\n And as is standard in these kinds of things,\n\n48:38.220 --> 48:40.500\n the professors actually don't do the work.\n\n48:40.500 --> 48:43.340\n The students do the work and figured out the answer.\n\n48:44.220 --> 48:46.940\n And then we helped them put together the story.\n\n48:48.560 --> 48:53.560\n And the story was simply that it was human, 100%.\n\n48:54.300 --> 48:57.300\n I went into it thinking it was originally a monkey\n\n48:57.300 --> 48:58.160\n of some sort.\n\n48:59.800 --> 49:02.700\n I got kind of excited a few months into the process,\n\n49:02.700 --> 49:06.300\n thinking, well, what happens if it is an alien, right?\n\n49:06.300 --> 49:08.180\n Can you describe some of the characteristics\n\n49:08.180 --> 49:10.420\n of the skeleton that makes it unique and interesting?\n\n49:10.420 --> 49:13.960\n Primarily, it had dysmorphias of the brain.\n\n49:13.960 --> 49:15.440\n And so the first thing I did actually,\n\n49:15.440 --> 49:17.040\n when I got pictures of it,\n\n49:17.040 --> 49:20.260\n I took it to a local expert at Stanford\n\n49:21.340 --> 49:24.320\n and he was on the paper.\n\n49:24.320 --> 49:29.320\n And he was the world expert in pediatric bone dysmorphias.\n\n49:29.320 --> 49:33.060\n He literally wrote the book on this,\n\n49:33.060 --> 49:33.900\n because that's what you do.\n\n49:33.900 --> 49:35.540\n You go to an expert when it's outside\n\n49:35.540 --> 49:36.980\n of your field of interest.\n\n49:36.980 --> 49:40.860\n And he said, well, I haven't seen this particular collection\n\n49:40.860 --> 49:45.860\n of mutations before or this physiology before,\n\n49:46.420 --> 49:48.220\n but here's what I think it might be.\n\n49:49.540 --> 49:53.540\n And he said, but based on the size of the thing\n\n49:53.540 --> 49:59.540\n and the bone density, it would appear to be like six\n\n49:59.540 --> 50:01.020\n or seven years old.\n\n50:01.020 --> 50:06.020\n Now, again, that's the thing where I think the lay public\n\n50:06.940 --> 50:11.380\n doesn't understand or takes a speculation like that\n\n50:11.380 --> 50:13.500\n and turns it into a fact.\n\n50:13.500 --> 50:15.900\n No one ever said that it was that age.\n\n50:15.900 --> 50:18.420\n We only said that the bones made it look like it was\n\n50:18.420 --> 50:22.100\n that age, but then we went back and looked for,\n\n50:22.100 --> 50:26.660\n we went back and looked for genetic explanations\n\n50:26.660 --> 50:29.060\n of why things might look the way they did.\n\n50:29.060 --> 50:32.580\n And if you, again, read the paper is very carefully\n\n50:32.580 --> 50:37.580\n caveated to say that these mutations might result in this.\n\n50:38.380 --> 50:43.380\n But what we did find was an unexpectedly large number\n\n50:43.460 --> 50:48.140\n of mutations associated with bone growth in this individual.\n\n50:48.140 --> 50:52.180\n And it was just a bad roll of the dice, right?\n\n50:52.180 --> 50:53.620\n You roll the dice enough times\n\n50:53.620 --> 50:56.460\n with enough people born every year\n\n50:56.460 --> 51:01.460\n and someone will roll the wrong dice all at once.\n\n51:02.740 --> 51:06.180\n So the sad part about it was individuals\n\n51:06.180 --> 51:09.540\n in the UFO community who wanted to think\n\n51:09.540 --> 51:14.020\n that there was some sort of conspiracy around it, right?\n\n51:14.020 --> 51:19.020\n That somebody had somehow convinced all of my students to lie.\n\n51:20.500 --> 51:24.340\n I mean, come on, you know, I would lose my job,\n\n51:24.340 --> 51:29.340\n first of all, and they would all be in trouble forever.\n\n51:31.340 --> 51:34.100\n Yeah, but also it's just projecting malevolence\n\n51:34.100 --> 51:37.820\n onto people that doesn't, I don't think exists\n\n51:37.820 --> 51:40.740\n in normal populace and especially doesn't exist\n\n51:40.740 --> 51:42.220\n in the scientific community.\n\n51:42.220 --> 51:43.740\n The kind of people that go into science,\n\n51:43.740 --> 51:44.900\n I mean, this is what bothers me\n\n51:44.900 --> 51:47.460\n with the current distrust of science,\n\n51:47.460 --> 51:51.780\n is they might be naive, they might not,\n\n51:51.780 --> 51:54.500\n especially in modern science, look at the big picture,\n\n51:54.500 --> 51:57.420\n philosophical, ethical questions, all that kind of stuff,\n\n51:57.420 --> 52:02.020\n but ultimately they're people with integrity\n\n52:02.020 --> 52:04.180\n and just a deep curiosity\n\n52:04.180 --> 52:06.820\n for the discovery of cool little things.\n\n52:06.820 --> 52:14.060\n And there's no malevolence, broadly speaking,\n\n52:14.060 --> 52:15.820\n in the scientific community.\n\n52:15.820 --> 52:17.660\n So, I mean, there's a bigger story here,\n\n52:17.660 --> 52:22.300\n which is, you know, there's a hunger in the populace\n\n52:22.300 --> 52:25.700\n to discover something anomalous, something new.\n\n52:25.700 --> 52:31.780\n And, you know, science has to be both open to the anomalous,\n\n52:31.780 --> 52:35.340\n but also to reject the anomalous\n\n52:35.340 --> 52:37.460\n when the data doesn't support it.\n\n52:37.460 --> 52:39.460\n What do you make of that, you know,\n\n52:39.460 --> 52:40.780\n walking that line for you?\n\n52:40.780 --> 52:42.820\n Because you're dealing with UFO encounters,\n\n52:42.820 --> 52:45.700\n you're dealing with the anomalous.\n\n52:45.700 --> 52:49.980\n Well, people have said, let's go back to the Atacama case\n\n52:49.980 --> 52:52.100\n that I was debunking it.\n\n52:52.100 --> 52:54.300\n Well, debunking is a loaded term.\n\n52:54.300 --> 52:57.700\n Sort of assumes that you were going in purposefully\n\n52:57.700 --> 53:00.580\n to prove something is wrong.\n\n53:00.580 --> 53:03.940\n I wasn't, I was just going in to collect the data.\n\n53:03.940 --> 53:08.140\n And, you know, I showed that this one was human.\n\n53:08.140 --> 53:11.220\n There was another skull that somebody had at one point.\n\n53:11.220 --> 53:12.300\n It was called the star child.\n\n53:12.300 --> 53:14.140\n They called it the star child skull.\n\n53:14.140 --> 53:15.780\n I said, you know, I looked at it.\n\n53:15.780 --> 53:18.020\n I looked at the DNA sequencing that they had done.\n\n53:18.020 --> 53:19.900\n I said, this is human.\n\n53:19.900 --> 53:22.420\n End of story.\n\n53:22.420 --> 53:26.340\n The people who owned the thing at the time disagreed with me,\n\n53:26.340 --> 53:28.540\n and then eventually another group came in\n\n53:28.540 --> 53:30.700\n and proved that I was right.\n\n53:30.700 --> 53:32.380\n And it's not about debunking.\n\n53:32.380 --> 53:36.740\n It's about getting the more spectacular and hyped cases\n\n53:36.740 --> 53:37.580\n off the table.\n\n53:37.580 --> 53:39.300\n I mean, the reason I got interested in it\n\n53:39.300 --> 53:41.100\n is because somebody was hyping it.\n\n53:41.100 --> 53:42.780\n And not because I wanted to disprove it,\n\n53:42.780 --> 53:44.620\n but because I just wanted to know.\n\n53:44.620 --> 53:46.860\n And thus, get it off the table, because it's usually\n\n53:46.860 --> 53:52.620\n the most extravagant things that are most likely to be wrong.\n\n53:52.620 --> 53:57.380\n Somewhere in the rubble will be something interesting.\n\n53:57.380 --> 53:58.660\n And so that's what you do.\n\n53:58.660 --> 54:02.340\n You get the dross off the table.\n\n54:02.340 --> 54:04.940\n And then somewhere in the data will\n\n54:04.940 --> 54:09.580\n be something worth real inquiry.\n\n54:09.580 --> 54:12.420\n And that, if you inquire deeply enough,\n\n54:12.420 --> 54:13.820\n will be extravagant as well.\n\n54:13.820 --> 54:15.060\n Yes, exactly.\n\n54:15.060 --> 54:18.340\n And that's what actually excites scientists is to, I mean,\n\n54:18.340 --> 54:21.100\n you want, with the rigor of science,\n\n54:21.100 --> 54:24.140\n to actually reveal the extravagant.\n\n54:24.140 --> 54:26.740\n And so look at CRISPR as probably the most perfect\n\n54:26.740 --> 54:27.940\n example of that.\n\n54:27.940 --> 54:32.780\n These weird sequences in bacterial genomes,\n\n54:32.780 --> 54:36.540\n all arrayed one after the other with these strange sequences\n\n54:36.540 --> 54:38.620\n around them, but when you looked at the sequences,\n\n54:38.620 --> 54:41.140\n they looked like viruses.\n\n54:41.140 --> 54:42.820\n And so how did they get there?\n\n54:42.820 --> 54:46.100\n And lo and behold, after a lot of effort and work,\n\n54:46.100 --> 54:48.900\n well, a couple of Nobel Prizes went out the door.\n\n54:48.900 --> 54:52.780\n But these strange things ended up\n\n54:52.780 --> 54:57.920\n having extraordinarily extravagant possibilities.\n\n54:57.920 --> 55:00.100\n You've also looked at UFO materials.\n\n55:00.100 --> 55:03.820\n You are in possession of UFO materials yourself.\n\n55:03.820 --> 55:07.100\n Claimed UFO materials, alleged.\n\n55:07.100 --> 55:08.940\n Alleged UFO materials, that's right.\n\n55:08.940 --> 55:11.580\n So what's another term?\n\n55:11.580 --> 55:17.500\n Weird materials that don't seem to have a story.\n\n55:17.500 --> 55:20.140\n They have a story that doesn't seem to be of natural origins,\n\n55:20.140 --> 55:25.980\n but it's not, you know, there's a process to proving that.\n\n55:25.980 --> 55:30.660\n And that process may take decades, if not centuries,\n\n55:30.660 --> 55:33.300\n because you have to keep pulling at the string\n\n55:33.300 --> 55:35.820\n and discover where they could possibly come from.\n\n55:35.820 --> 55:37.660\n But anyway, you're in a possession\n\n55:37.660 --> 55:41.540\n of some materials of this kind.\n\n55:41.540 --> 55:45.780\n Can you describe some of them and maybe also\n\n55:45.780 --> 55:48.540\n talk to the process of how you investigate them,\n\n55:48.540 --> 55:50.100\n how do you analyze them?\n\n55:50.100 --> 55:53.900\n Right, so let's say that there's two classes of materials\n\n55:53.900 --> 55:56.380\n that I've been given by people.\n\n55:56.380 --> 55:58.380\n And they're not given by the government or anything,\n\n55:58.380 --> 56:00.220\n just given people who've collected them,\n\n56:00.220 --> 56:03.140\n and there's a reasonable chain of evidence associated\n\n56:03.140 --> 56:05.900\n with them that you believe is not just a pebble somebody\n\n56:05.900 --> 56:06.820\n picked up off a road.\n\n56:09.500 --> 56:12.020\n There are almost always things that people have claimed\n\n56:12.020 --> 56:15.500\n have either been dropped off as like some sort\n\n56:15.500 --> 56:19.280\n of a leftover material, molten metals,\n\n56:19.280 --> 56:26.580\n or they are from an object that was released from this\n\n56:26.580 --> 56:29.500\n or that kind of exploded.\n\n56:29.500 --> 56:31.040\n They're almost always metals.\n\n56:31.040 --> 56:32.460\n I have some couple of things that\n\n56:32.460 --> 56:34.780\n might be biological that are interesting that I haven't\n\n56:34.780 --> 56:36.500\n really spent a lot of time on yet.\n\n56:36.500 --> 56:39.920\n When you look at a metal, you basically, well, OK,\n\n56:39.920 --> 56:42.260\n what are the elements in it?\n\n56:42.260 --> 56:44.460\n And what's it made of?\n\n56:44.460 --> 56:47.840\n And so there's pretty standard approaches to doing that.\n\n56:47.840 --> 56:49.540\n Most of them involve a technology\n\n56:49.540 --> 56:52.180\n called mass spectrometry, and there's probably\n\n56:52.180 --> 56:54.300\n about five or six different kinds of mass spectrometry\n\n56:54.300 --> 56:57.620\n that you could bring to bear on answering it.\n\n56:57.620 --> 56:59.500\n And they either tell you, depending\n\n56:59.500 --> 57:02.260\n upon the limit of the resolution of the instrument,\n\n57:02.260 --> 57:05.220\n they either tell you the elements that are there,\n\n57:05.220 --> 57:07.140\n or they tell you the isotopes that are there.\n\n57:07.140 --> 57:09.680\n And you're interested not just in knowing whether something\n\n57:09.680 --> 57:12.620\n is there or not, you're interested in knowing\n\n57:12.620 --> 57:17.740\n whether there are the amounts of it,\n\n57:17.740 --> 57:22.300\n and in the case of elements, how many different isotopes\n\n57:22.300 --> 57:23.540\n are there.\n\n57:23.540 --> 57:25.900\n And that's kind of where, in some of these cases,\n\n57:25.900 --> 57:27.580\n it gets interesting.\n\n57:27.580 --> 57:30.620\n Because in at least one of the materials,\n\n57:30.620 --> 57:34.500\n as we first studied it, the isotope ratios of, in this case,\n\n57:34.500 --> 57:37.380\n it was magnesium, are way off normal.\n\n57:37.380 --> 57:40.060\n And I just don't know why.\n\n57:40.060 --> 57:43.260\n It doesn't prove anything.\n\n57:43.260 --> 57:48.500\n All it proves is that it was probably accomplished\n\n57:48.500 --> 57:51.300\n by some kind of an industrial process.\n\n57:51.300 --> 57:55.140\n Whether it's the result of a process,\n\n57:55.140 --> 57:57.420\n and this is sort of the leftover,\n\n57:57.420 --> 58:01.740\n or whether it was made that way for a particular purpose,\n\n58:01.740 --> 58:02.740\n I don't know.\n\n58:02.740 --> 58:09.860\n All I know is that it was engineered.\n\n58:09.860 --> 58:11.540\n That's it.\n\n58:11.540 --> 58:16.980\n But then the question is, sort of you go one step deeper,\n\n58:16.980 --> 58:20.340\n why would you engineer it?\n\n58:20.340 --> 58:21.380\n Right.\n\n58:21.380 --> 58:24.260\n Why engineer it, and what does engineered means?\n\n58:24.260 --> 58:27.260\n There's all kinds of, it could be a byproduct,\n\n58:27.260 --> 58:34.220\n it could be the main result of an engineering process,\n\n58:34.220 --> 58:37.580\n it would be a small part of the engineering process that\n\n58:37.580 --> 58:39.140\n is the main part.\n\n58:39.140 --> 58:43.860\n Well, so the ratios of isotopes for any given element\n\n58:43.860 --> 58:48.540\n are basically the result of stellar processes.\n\n58:48.540 --> 58:55.620\n Supernova blew up sometime several billion years ago.\n\n58:55.620 --> 58:56.940\n That became a cloud.\n\n58:56.940 --> 59:00.660\n Those atoms coalesced gravitationally\n\n59:00.660 --> 59:07.100\n to form another sun, and a ring that became a rocky planet.\n\n59:07.100 --> 59:11.100\n And the ratios of the isotopes were determined\n\n59:11.100 --> 59:14.500\n at the time of that explosion.\n\n59:14.500 --> 59:17.260\n And so everything in the local solar system\n\n59:17.260 --> 59:20.180\n is more or less of that ratio, depending\n\n59:20.180 --> 59:22.260\n upon certain gravitational difference.\n\n59:22.260 --> 59:28.500\n But by fragments of a percent, not whole tens of percent\n\n59:28.500 --> 59:29.700\n difference.\n\n59:29.700 --> 59:32.580\n So what do humans use isotopes for?\n\n59:32.580 --> 59:34.220\n Mostly to blow stuff up.\n\n59:34.220 --> 59:36.500\n I mean, the vast majority of the isotopes\n\n59:36.500 --> 59:40.700\n that have been made in the per pound or ton\n\n59:40.700 --> 59:44.540\n are things like certain ratios of plutonium and uranium\n\n59:44.540 --> 59:45.780\n to blow stuff up.\n\n59:45.780 --> 59:51.180\n We don't make or engineer isotopes, which today\n\n59:51.180 --> 59:54.100\n is relatively easy to do, but it's still expensive.\n\n59:54.100 --> 1:00:00.540\n For any other reason, apart from, let's say, anti cancer,\n\n1:00:00.540 --> 1:00:03.700\n we use stable isotopes and money these days\n\n1:00:03.700 --> 1:00:04.860\n as a counterfeiting tool.\n\n1:00:04.860 --> 1:00:08.220\n You basically embed certain ratios of isotopes\n\n1:00:08.220 --> 1:00:14.140\n in to make it harder for counterfeiters to accomplish.\n\n1:00:14.140 --> 1:00:16.660\n But other than that, we don't do anything with that.\n\n1:00:16.660 --> 1:00:21.940\n So why would you make grams of such material in this one case\n\n1:00:21.940 --> 1:00:25.460\n and drop it around on a beach in Brazil?\n\n1:00:25.460 --> 1:00:26.940\n So which case are we talking about?\n\n1:00:26.940 --> 1:00:30.620\n Describe that, because this is the Ubatuba case.\n\n1:00:30.620 --> 1:00:32.660\n Can you describe this case a little bit further,\n\n1:00:32.660 --> 1:00:35.300\n like what material we're talking about, just the full story\n\n1:00:35.300 --> 1:00:36.580\n of the case?\n\n1:00:36.580 --> 1:00:37.580\n It's an interesting one.\n\n1:00:37.580 --> 1:00:38.580\n It's an interesting one.\n\n1:00:38.580 --> 1:00:43.420\n So a fisherman saw an object that released something,\n\n1:00:43.420 --> 1:00:45.860\n or it exploded.\n\n1:00:45.860 --> 1:00:51.420\n And it was this relatively, I've got some big chunks of it,\n\n1:00:51.420 --> 1:00:55.260\n relatively pure magnesium with obviously something else in it\n\n1:00:55.260 --> 1:00:56.820\n because magnesium burns.\n\n1:00:56.820 --> 1:01:00.660\n So it had something in it that would, other metals,\n\n1:01:00.660 --> 1:01:07.900\n simple alloy that would prevent it from basically burning up.\n\n1:01:07.900 --> 1:01:10.900\n And so the question is, and so then we\n\n1:01:10.900 --> 1:01:15.660\n had two pieces that came from two different chains of custody,\n\n1:01:15.660 --> 1:01:19.420\n both claimed to be from the same object.\n\n1:01:19.420 --> 1:01:23.220\n At least physically, when you look at the two things,\n\n1:01:23.220 --> 1:01:26.980\n they look the same.\n\n1:01:26.980 --> 1:01:29.820\n So we took small fragments of each of them.\n\n1:01:29.820 --> 1:01:32.260\n We put them in an instrument called a secondary ion mass\n\n1:01:32.260 --> 1:01:35.900\n spec, which is an extremely sensitive instrument.\n\n1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:41.740\n And it can see down to 0.0001 mass units,\n\n1:01:41.740 --> 1:01:46.100\n which is important for, let's say, more arcane reasons.\n\n1:01:46.100 --> 1:01:48.780\n But it's a sensitive instrument.\n\n1:01:48.780 --> 1:01:52.900\n And so one of the chains of custody,\n\n1:01:52.900 --> 1:01:55.860\n we had two pieces from the same chain of custody,\n\n1:01:55.860 --> 1:01:59.380\n and then two pieces from the other chain of custody.\n\n1:01:59.380 --> 1:02:04.140\n One of them had completely normal magnesium isotope\n\n1:02:04.140 --> 1:02:06.540\n ratios, magnesium 24, 25, 26.\n\n1:02:06.540 --> 1:02:09.740\n And the other was off, not just slightly off, way off.\n\n1:02:09.740 --> 1:02:11.420\n And they were both off to the same extent.\n\n1:02:14.860 --> 1:02:18.020\n I mean, it was sort of like you had an internal control\n\n1:02:18.020 --> 1:02:18.860\n of what was normal.\n\n1:02:18.860 --> 1:02:22.340\n And you had this other one, which was wrong.\n\n1:02:22.340 --> 1:02:28.540\n And so you're left with kind of an open question.\n\n1:02:28.540 --> 1:02:29.900\n Was this a hoax?\n\n1:02:29.900 --> 1:02:32.420\n Were these two chains of custody, one of them a hoax,\n\n1:02:32.420 --> 1:02:35.100\n that somebody purposefully introduced those things?\n\n1:02:35.100 --> 1:02:36.300\n Because you could do it.\n\n1:02:36.300 --> 1:02:38.420\n It would cost a lot.\n\n1:02:38.420 --> 1:02:40.780\n I mean, at the time that this was found,\n\n1:02:40.780 --> 1:02:45.020\n I guess the 1970s or so, it might have been earlier,\n\n1:02:45.020 --> 1:02:49.260\n I forget, the amount that I had would\n\n1:02:49.260 --> 1:02:53.940\n have cost several tens of thousands of dollars to make.\n\n1:02:53.940 --> 1:02:56.180\n And again, it's not something you would just throw around.\n\n1:02:56.180 --> 1:02:58.860\n And why would you do it in the hope that some guy 30 years\n\n1:02:58.860 --> 1:03:02.500\n from then would pick it up and study it?\n\n1:03:02.500 --> 1:03:05.100\n Yeah, it's a very subtle, subtle troll.\n\n1:03:05.100 --> 1:03:08.140\n It's a long term plan.\n\n1:03:08.140 --> 1:03:12.340\n So I just don't know what to make of it,\n\n1:03:12.340 --> 1:03:15.100\n except it's interesting.\n\n1:03:15.100 --> 1:03:17.620\n So a different kind of question that you're asking\n\n1:03:17.620 --> 1:03:21.500\n is, what constitutes evidence?\n\n1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:27.700\n So is this sufficient evidence? Absolutely not.\n\n1:03:27.700 --> 1:03:29.660\n But somebody's put it forward.\n\n1:03:29.660 --> 1:03:30.460\n I have the time.\n\n1:03:30.460 --> 1:03:33.020\n It's my time.\n\n1:03:33.020 --> 1:03:33.740\n I'll study it.\n\n1:03:33.740 --> 1:03:36.140\n And my objective is to sort of take\n\n1:03:36.140 --> 1:03:38.460\n those that I think are credible enough\n\n1:03:38.460 --> 1:03:41.220\n and do a reasonable analysis, put it out there.\n\n1:03:41.220 --> 1:03:43.260\n And maybe somebody else will come up with an idea\n\n1:03:43.260 --> 1:03:44.580\n as to what it is.\n\n1:03:44.580 --> 1:03:51.140\n Now, what would be better is some sort of true technology,\n\n1:03:51.140 --> 1:03:53.100\n something that is obviously.\n\n1:03:53.100 --> 1:03:55.020\n We don't have it.\n\n1:03:55.020 --> 1:04:00.460\n And people like Neil deGrasse Tyson and Seth Shostak\n\n1:04:00.460 --> 1:04:04.020\n have come out rightfully and have said,\n\n1:04:04.020 --> 1:04:11.780\n when you show up with something really obviously technology\n\n1:04:11.780 --> 1:04:16.180\n that we don't understand, then we'll pay attention.\n\n1:04:16.180 --> 1:04:17.260\n Not just material.\n\n1:04:17.260 --> 1:04:18.260\n Not just material.\n\n1:04:18.260 --> 1:04:24.100\n A piece of metal is interesting.\n\n1:04:24.100 --> 1:04:26.020\n And several of the things that I've looked at\n\n1:04:26.020 --> 1:04:29.580\n and other things that people have come to me with,\n\n1:04:29.580 --> 1:04:32.100\n we've found to be completely banal\n\n1:04:32.100 --> 1:04:35.780\n or were actually pieces of aircraft\n\n1:04:35.780 --> 1:04:38.580\n that were invented back in the 1940s.\n\n1:04:38.580 --> 1:04:40.780\n And so take them off the table.\n\n1:04:40.780 --> 1:04:46.740\n But I think, again, I think showing up\n\n1:04:46.740 --> 1:04:50.580\n with technology that we humans would find completely novel\n\n1:04:50.580 --> 1:04:53.460\n is actually a really difficult task for aliens\n\n1:04:53.460 --> 1:04:56.820\n because it obviously can't be so novel\n\n1:04:56.820 --> 1:05:00.340\n that we don't recognize it for what it is.\n\n1:05:00.340 --> 1:05:04.340\n And I would say most of the technology aliens likely have\n\n1:05:04.340 --> 1:05:07.500\n would be something we don't recognize.\n\n1:05:07.500 --> 1:05:11.900\n So it's actually a hard problem how to convince ants.\n\n1:05:11.900 --> 1:05:16.300\n You first have to understand what ants are tweeting about.\n\n1:05:16.300 --> 1:05:21.420\n What they care about in order to inject into their culture.\n\n1:05:21.420 --> 1:05:26.940\n Because that's why I think it would be the technology\n\n1:05:26.940 --> 1:05:29.660\n that you could present is in the space of ideas,\n\n1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:35.780\n is try to influence individual humans with the encounters\n\n1:05:35.780 --> 1:05:39.780\n and try to, with this kind of thing that you mentioned\n\n1:05:39.780 --> 1:05:46.460\n about us not taking messages, about us not taking care of the world.\n\n1:05:46.460 --> 1:05:49.700\n It's difficult. I mean, for them to understand,\n\n1:05:49.700 --> 1:05:52.420\n you have to come up with trinkets that impress us.\n\n1:05:52.420 --> 1:05:56.020\n I mean, maybe the very technology,\n\n1:05:56.020 --> 1:05:58.540\n the fascination with the development of technology\n\n1:05:58.540 --> 1:06:00.420\n and the development of technology,\n\n1:06:00.420 --> 1:06:03.140\n the actual act of innovation itself\n\n1:06:03.140 --> 1:06:05.980\n is the thing that they're communicating.\n\n1:06:05.980 --> 1:06:11.380\n I mean, this is kind of what Jacques Vall\u00e9e thinks about, is the role of...\n\n1:06:11.380 --> 1:06:13.220\n The control system, he calls it.\n\n1:06:13.220 --> 1:06:16.620\n The control system. Well, let me ask about Jacques.\n\n1:06:16.620 --> 1:06:22.860\n Who is he? You know him. Who is Jacques Vall\u00e9e?\n\n1:06:22.860 --> 1:06:30.220\n What have you learned from him about life, about UFOs,\n\n1:06:30.220 --> 1:06:33.500\n about technology, about our role in the universe?\n\n1:06:33.500 --> 1:06:40.340\n Well, I met Jacques actually soon after the whole Atacama thing happened.\n\n1:06:40.340 --> 1:06:43.900\n I was visited by those people associated with the government\n\n1:06:43.900 --> 1:06:47.580\n and whatever around the Havana...\n\n1:06:47.580 --> 1:06:50.220\n What ended up mostly being Havana syndrome patients,\n\n1:06:50.220 --> 1:06:51.500\n but also Jacques at the same time.\n\n1:06:51.500 --> 1:06:54.500\n And they were actually working behind the scenes with each other,\n\n1:06:54.500 --> 1:06:57.260\n that, oh, here's this Stanford professor\n\n1:06:57.260 --> 1:07:01.500\n who is willing to talk about this stuff and investigate things.\n\n1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:03.060\n Maybe we should go talk to him.\n\n1:07:03.060 --> 1:07:06.060\n And he reached out through a colleague\n\n1:07:06.060 --> 1:07:12.380\n and he and I had lunch actually at the Rosewood Inn up on near Sandhill.\n\n1:07:12.380 --> 1:07:19.820\n So Jacques is one of the first openly active scientists,\n\n1:07:19.820 --> 1:07:26.220\n and he's really a scientist, in this area going back to the 1960s.\n\n1:07:26.220 --> 1:07:31.820\n And he's put forward a number of ideas,\n\n1:07:31.820 --> 1:07:36.060\n speculations about what it might be that people are interacting with.\n\n1:07:36.060 --> 1:07:38.220\n And the first thing that I learned from him\n\n1:07:38.220 --> 1:07:41.620\n is this notion of what he called Kabuki theater,\n\n1:07:41.620 --> 1:07:45.180\n that many of the things that people have seen are...\n\n1:07:45.180 --> 1:07:47.180\n I remember reading his books and thinking,\n\n1:07:47.180 --> 1:07:50.580\n he uses this word absurd a lot.\n\n1:07:50.580 --> 1:07:56.500\n He said, the things that people claim they see are absurd, right?\n\n1:07:56.500 --> 1:08:00.820\n A ship doesn't land in a farmer's field\n\n1:08:00.820 --> 1:08:02.620\n and then come up and knock on the door and say,\n\n1:08:02.620 --> 1:08:03.900\n can I have a glass of water?\n\n1:08:03.900 --> 1:08:08.100\n And these are stories literally out of newspapers from the 1930s.\n\n1:08:08.100 --> 1:08:09.660\n It's absurd.\n\n1:08:09.660 --> 1:08:12.620\n And the other thing that people say, ships don't crash.\n\n1:08:12.620 --> 1:08:15.740\n If you're so technologically advanced, you don't crash.\n\n1:08:15.740 --> 1:08:18.620\n It's absurd that they crash.\n\n1:08:18.620 --> 1:08:24.580\n So he says, this is put on as a show.\n\n1:08:24.580 --> 1:08:29.420\n It's an influence campaign, right?\n\n1:08:29.420 --> 1:08:31.860\n It's not meant to influence individuals.\n\n1:08:31.860 --> 1:08:35.700\n It's meant to influence a culture as a whole.\n\n1:08:35.700 --> 1:08:37.620\n Maybe they don't look at us as individuals.\n\n1:08:37.620 --> 1:08:43.460\n Maybe they look at us as an organism that lives on a planet, right?\n\n1:08:43.460 --> 1:08:45.220\n And perhaps rightly so.\n\n1:08:45.220 --> 1:08:47.140\n And so that's how you interact with them.\n\n1:08:47.140 --> 1:08:48.860\n That's how you influence them.\n\n1:08:48.860 --> 1:08:51.420\n So that was one of the first things that kind of took me back\n\n1:08:51.420 --> 1:08:53.780\n and realized, wow, there's actually...\n\n1:08:53.780 --> 1:09:00.580\n maybe there's a puppet master behind the scenes that's doing this influencing\n\n1:09:00.580 --> 1:09:05.140\n and that all this stuff about aliens is just not true, per se.\n\n1:09:05.140 --> 1:09:09.740\n They're just a representation of something that is meant to influence.\n\n1:09:09.740 --> 1:09:11.220\n So that was probably the most interesting.\n\n1:09:11.220 --> 1:09:13.340\n I mean, the man is brilliant.\n\n1:09:13.340 --> 1:09:18.420\n He's also, and I'm sorry, Jacques, he can also be incredibly annoying\n\n1:09:18.420 --> 1:09:23.660\n to have a conversation with because he will pick apart your arguments\n\n1:09:23.660 --> 1:09:25.500\n or anything that you think you know\n\n1:09:25.500 --> 1:09:28.900\n and show you why you don't know what you think you know.\n\n1:09:28.900 --> 1:09:34.980\n And he used the example that, for me, that is all you need\n\n1:09:34.980 --> 1:09:41.540\n is one counter example to any conclusion and you're wrong.\n\n1:09:41.540 --> 1:09:43.500\n And so I learned from him...\n\n1:09:43.500 --> 1:09:47.180\n I mean, I'm supposed to be a good scientist, but I learned from him,\n\n1:09:47.180 --> 1:09:50.820\n don't talk about conclusions, just talk about the data\n\n1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:52.060\n because data is not wrong.\n\n1:09:52.060 --> 1:09:55.820\n I mean, convince yourself that the data is not wrong or not an artifact,\n\n1:09:55.820 --> 1:09:58.660\n but be careful about your conclusions because whatever is going on,\n\n1:09:58.660 --> 1:10:02.980\n it's much more complicated than we imagine.\n\n1:10:02.980 --> 1:10:03.820\n Wow, that's powerful.\n\n1:10:03.820 --> 1:10:07.460\n Being able to always step back because we humans get excited.\n\n1:10:07.460 --> 1:10:07.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:10:07.700 --> 1:10:11.500\n We start to jump to conclusions from the data, but always step back.\n\n1:10:11.500 --> 1:10:11.700\n Well...\n\n1:10:11.700 --> 1:10:15.580\n Powerful, being able to always step back because we humans get excited.\n\n1:10:15.580 --> 1:10:15.820\n Yeah.\n\n1:10:15.820 --> 1:10:19.620\n We start to jump to conclusions from the data, but always step back.\n\n1:10:19.620 --> 1:10:23.420\n Well, in some of my Twitter feeds, when I dare to go on Twitter,\n\n1:10:23.420 --> 1:10:27.340\n are full of, well, when are you going to give us the answer?\n\n1:10:27.340 --> 1:10:29.180\n Science is not immediate.\n\n1:10:29.180 --> 1:10:31.020\n You're going to have to be patient.\n\n1:10:31.020 --> 1:10:35.060\n And even some of my science colleagues have said, well, where's the data?\n\n1:10:35.060 --> 1:10:39.940\n My answer to them has been, where's been your work to try to produce any?\n\n1:10:39.940 --> 1:10:43.580\n I'm not here to give you everything on a silver platter.\n\n1:10:43.580 --> 1:10:48.260\n We talked offline how much I love data and machine learning and so on.\n\n1:10:48.260 --> 1:10:51.620\n And it's been really disheartening to see the U.S.\n\n1:10:51.620 --> 1:10:56.940\n government not invest as much as they possibly could into this whole process.\n\n1:10:56.940 --> 1:11:01.540\n So let's jump to the most recent thing, which is what do you make of the report\n\n1:11:01.540 --> 1:11:08.260\n titled Preliminary Assessment, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena that was released by the\n\n1:11:08.260 --> 1:11:12.740\n Office of the Director of National Intelligence in June 2021.\n\n1:11:12.740 --> 1:11:18.980\n So this is what's like, okay, we're going to step back and we're going to like,\n\n1:11:18.980 --> 1:11:21.500\n where do we stand and where do we hope the future is?\n\n1:11:21.500 --> 1:11:22.540\n What do you make of that report?\n\n1:11:22.540 --> 1:11:23.700\n Is it hopeful?\n\n1:11:23.700 --> 1:11:24.220\n Is it?\n\n1:11:24.220 --> 1:11:26.860\n I see it as very hopeful, very hopeful.\n\n1:11:26.860 --> 1:11:31.860\n I think the adults are finally stepping up and being in charge, right?\n\n1:11:31.860 --> 1:11:33.700\n In the good sense of adult.\n\n1:11:33.700 --> 1:11:34.300\n What's that?\n\n1:11:34.300 --> 1:11:37.580\n In the good sense of adult.\n\n1:11:37.580 --> 1:11:40.380\n This childlike curiosity is a pretty powerful thing.\n\n1:11:40.380 --> 1:11:42.260\n That's true, yeah.\n\n1:11:42.260 --> 1:11:47.580\n But it's also, I think, the people who were worried that the populace at large might run\n\n1:11:47.580 --> 1:11:53.180\n screaming into the streets and riot, you know, have, you know, they basically,\n\n1:11:53.180 --> 1:11:55.300\n the empiric evidence is they're wrong.\n\n1:11:55.300 --> 1:12:00.460\n You know, these videos and all these things have been out for now, what, five years?\n\n1:12:00.460 --> 1:12:02.780\n Most people don't even know about it, right?\n\n1:12:02.780 --> 1:12:08.780\n So as hyped as it's been and all over the newspapers that it's been and et cetera,\n\n1:12:08.780 --> 1:12:14.460\n you know, even Tucker Carlson has talked about it many times on his news program.\n\n1:12:14.460 --> 1:12:15.380\n Joe Rogan has.\n\n1:12:15.380 --> 1:12:16.820\n A lot of people don't know about it.\n\n1:12:16.820 --> 1:12:20.700\n So I think people, if it's not affecting their day to day life,\n\n1:12:20.700 --> 1:12:23.220\n they're going on with their day to day life.\n\n1:12:23.220 --> 1:12:30.020\n So, but that said, I think it was an important sea change in the internal\n\n1:12:30.020 --> 1:12:35.460\n discussions going on in the government because, and the reason being,\n\n1:12:35.460 --> 1:12:43.020\n that I think this is actually partly true with the maturation of human social technology.\n\n1:12:43.020 --> 1:12:49.060\n It was becoming so obvious that this stuff was showing up again and again and again around our ships.\n\n1:12:49.060 --> 1:12:51.820\n They just couldn't keep it quiet anymore, right?\n\n1:12:51.820 --> 1:12:53.900\n And so it's like, we need to do something about it.\n\n1:12:53.900 --> 1:13:00.580\n And Lou Elizondo and Chris and others, to their great credit, found the right angle to talk about this.\n\n1:13:00.580 --> 1:13:04.220\n It says, well, okay, let's say it's not out there.\n\n1:13:04.220 --> 1:13:06.860\n Maybe it's the Russians, the Chinese or somebody else.\n\n1:13:06.860 --> 1:13:11.380\n We should know about this because we damn sure know it's not us.\n\n1:13:11.380 --> 1:13:20.660\n So that to me is an important thing to finally be a little bit more open about the matter.\n\n1:13:20.660 --> 1:13:26.140\n But like I often say, I'm not looking for people to give me permission to do anything.\n\n1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:29.180\n I'm just going to do the analysis myself with what I have.\n\n1:13:29.180 --> 1:13:31.900\n Avi Loeb has taken the same approach.\n\n1:13:31.900 --> 1:13:38.420\n He said, I'm not going to wait for the government to give me telescopic information about technologies\n\n1:13:38.420 --> 1:13:41.940\n or things that might be even on our own solar system.\n\n1:13:41.940 --> 1:13:44.140\n I'm just going to collect it myself.\n\n1:13:44.140 --> 1:13:46.420\n And that's the right way to do it, right?\n\n1:13:46.420 --> 1:13:48.740\n Don't wait for somebody else to give it to you.\n\n1:13:48.740 --> 1:13:55.540\n It's also possible to inspire a large number of people to do a wider spread data collection.\n\n1:13:55.540 --> 1:13:55.900\n Yes.\n\n1:13:55.900 --> 1:14:00.700\n I mean, you yourself can't do a large enough data collection that would,\n\n1:14:00.700 --> 1:14:08.740\n if you're talking about anomalous events, you should be collecting high resolution data\n\n1:14:08.740 --> 1:14:15.660\n about everything that's happening on Earth in terms of like, in terms of the kind of things\n\n1:14:15.660 --> 1:14:20.100\n that would indicate to you a strong signal that something weird happened here.\n\n1:14:20.100 --> 1:14:26.180\n And this is why governments can be good at funding large scale efforts.\n\n1:14:26.180 --> 1:14:26.740\n Yes.\n\n1:14:26.740 --> 1:14:33.940\n I mean, you know, NASA and so on, working with SpaceX, with Blue Origin, you know,\n\n1:14:33.940 --> 1:14:42.260\n fund capitalistic sort of fund companies, fund company efforts to do huge moonshot projects.\n\n1:14:42.260 --> 1:14:43.060\n Right.\n\n1:14:43.060 --> 1:14:47.860\n And in the same way, do huge moonshot data collection efforts in terms of UFOs.\n\n1:14:47.860 --> 1:14:53.540\n I mean, we're not, it needs to be like 10X, like one or two orders of magnitude more funding.\n\n1:14:53.540 --> 1:14:53.860\n Exactly.\n\n1:14:53.860 --> 1:14:55.180\n To do this kind of thing.\n\n1:14:55.180 --> 1:14:59.740\n And I understand on the flip side of that, if you make it about what are the Russians,\n\n1:14:59.740 --> 1:15:06.620\n whether the Chinese doing, you know, make it a question of geopolitics, it gets touchy.\n\n1:15:06.620 --> 1:15:11.660\n Because now you're kind of taken away from the realm of science and...\n\n1:15:11.660 --> 1:15:12.700\n Making it military.\n\n1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:13.660\n Making it military.\n\n1:15:13.660 --> 1:15:18.620\n Some of the greatest, this is what makes me as an engineer, makes me truly sad that some\n\n1:15:18.620 --> 1:15:24.940\n of the greatest engineering work ever done is by Lockheed Martin, and we will never know about it.\n\n1:15:24.940 --> 1:15:25.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:25.420 --> 1:15:26.060\n I agree.\n\n1:15:26.060 --> 1:15:26.540\n I agree.\n\n1:15:26.540 --> 1:15:31.580\n I wish we were, it was different, but it's the world we live in.\n\n1:15:33.340 --> 1:15:39.580\n You know, but related to that UIP task force announcement that you just said, you know,\n\n1:15:39.580 --> 1:15:43.740\n the bill was passed in the Department of Defense and now it formally establishes an office\n\n1:15:44.620 --> 1:15:49.580\n to collate that information and also to be transparent about it.\n\n1:15:50.380 --> 1:15:52.780\n Money is now set aside, right?\n\n1:15:52.780 --> 1:15:57.580\n What do you think of it, just in case people don't know, the DOD establishing new department\n\n1:15:57.580 --> 1:16:02.780\n to study UFOs called Airborne Naming Command.\n\n1:16:02.780 --> 1:16:07.100\n But yes, Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group.\n\n1:16:07.980 --> 1:16:08.940\n Do you know how to pronounce that?\n\n1:16:08.940 --> 1:16:09.740\n No, I do not.\n\n1:16:09.740 --> 1:16:09.980\n No.\n\n1:16:09.980 --> 1:16:11.980\n AOI MSG.\n\n1:16:11.980 --> 1:16:13.820\n It's stupid and needs to be renamed, but...\n\n1:16:13.820 --> 1:16:15.020\n AOI MSG.\n\n1:16:15.660 --> 1:16:22.300\n AO, all right, is directed by the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security.\n\n1:16:22.300 --> 1:16:23.500\n What do you make of this office?\n\n1:16:24.060 --> 1:16:26.460\n Are you hopeful about this office?\n\n1:16:26.460 --> 1:16:30.700\n I think there's still a tug of war going on behind the scenes as to who's going to control\n\n1:16:30.700 --> 1:16:31.200\n this.\n\n1:16:32.220 --> 1:16:40.460\n But I do know, though, that money has been set aside that will be used to make things\n\n1:16:41.020 --> 1:16:45.100\n more public, right, to start to get others involved.\n\n1:16:45.100 --> 1:16:51.660\n And, you know, I'm involved with an effort to get other academics involved.\n\n1:16:51.660 --> 1:16:55.820\n So you think there might be some of that money could be directed towards funding maybe like\n\n1:16:55.820 --> 1:16:59.020\n groups like yours to do some research here.\n\n1:16:59.020 --> 1:17:01.020\n So they would be open to that, you think?\n\n1:17:01.020 --> 1:17:01.740\n I hope so.\n\n1:17:01.740 --> 1:17:04.060\n I mean, nothing is set in stone yet.\n\n1:17:04.060 --> 1:17:08.460\n So, you know, and I'm not hiding anything because I just don't know anything, right.\n\n1:17:08.460 --> 1:17:14.700\n But I do think that there will be public efforts.\n\n1:17:14.700 --> 1:17:21.580\n Now, there are being set up other private efforts to bring monies involved and to use\n\n1:17:21.580 --> 1:17:27.580\n that to leverage and get access to some of the internal resources as well.\n\n1:17:28.140 --> 1:17:36.140\n So what you're seeing is kind of an ecosystem building up in a positive sense of people\n\n1:17:36.140 --> 1:17:38.540\n who are willing to do the research.\n\n1:17:39.420 --> 1:17:43.980\n So, you know, before it would be you couldn't even go to a scientist and ask them to help.\n\n1:17:45.100 --> 1:17:50.060\n Now, if there's money, as I said before, scientists are essentially capitalists.\n\n1:17:50.060 --> 1:17:51.660\n We go where the money is.\n\n1:17:52.220 --> 1:17:54.780\n I mean, the work that I've done, I did out of my own pocket.\n\n1:17:55.980 --> 1:18:01.660\n And probably about $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 of money went into the paper we published\n\n1:18:02.220 --> 1:18:03.180\n out of my own pocket.\n\n1:18:05.580 --> 1:18:10.540\n But the amount of money that needs to go in is in at least the few millions to do\n\n1:18:10.540 --> 1:18:12.940\n a proper analysis of these materials.\n\n1:18:12.940 --> 1:18:19.580\n The work I know that the Galileo project is involved with, it's probably in the, you\n\n1:18:19.580 --> 1:18:22.620\n know, 5 to 10 million range to get stuff done.\n\n1:18:22.620 --> 1:18:28.140\n But that's actually a relatively modest amount of money to accomplish something that\n\n1:18:28.140 --> 1:18:31.500\n has been in the zeitgeist for decades.\n\n1:18:32.940 --> 1:18:37.100\n I should also push back a little bit on something you probably will agree with.\n\n1:18:37.100 --> 1:18:39.180\n You said scientists are essentially capitalists.\n\n1:18:39.180 --> 1:18:43.820\n What I've noticed is there's certainly an influence of money, but oftentimes when you're\n\n1:18:43.820 --> 1:18:52.380\n talking about basic research and basic science, the money is a little bit ambiguous to what\n\n1:18:52.380 --> 1:18:54.380\n direction you're doing the research in.\n\n1:18:54.380 --> 1:19:00.220\n And the scientists get really good at telling a narrative of like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're\n\n1:19:00.220 --> 1:19:05.740\n fulfilling the purpose of this funding, but we're actually, they end up doing really what\n\n1:19:05.740 --> 1:19:06.700\n they're curious about.\n\n1:19:06.700 --> 1:19:07.180\n Yes.\n\n1:19:07.180 --> 1:19:11.900\n And of course you cannot deviate like if you're getting funded to study penguins in Antarctica,\n\n1:19:11.900 --> 1:19:17.420\n you can't start building rockets, but probably you can because you will convince some kind,\n\n1:19:17.420 --> 1:19:21.580\n you'll concoct a narrative saying rockets are really important for studying penguins\n\n1:19:21.580 --> 1:19:22.380\n in the Antarctic.\n\n1:19:22.380 --> 1:19:22.940\n Right.\n\n1:19:22.940 --> 1:19:29.980\n I think that's actually, this is one thing I think people don't generally understand\n\n1:19:29.980 --> 1:19:35.420\n about the scientific mind is I don't know how capitalistic it is because if it was,\n\n1:19:35.420 --> 1:19:37.500\n they would start an effing company.\n\n1:19:37.500 --> 1:19:38.300\n No, no, no, no.\n\n1:19:38.300 --> 1:19:44.140\n I mean, when I meant capitalist, I didn't mean in the, they'll start companies per se.\n\n1:19:44.140 --> 1:19:47.260\n I mean, we can only do the research where there's money.\n\n1:19:48.060 --> 1:19:53.100\n And so from, you know, maybe it's a bad use of the term capitalist.\n\n1:19:53.100 --> 1:19:57.660\n But we will only do the research where there's money.\n\n1:19:57.660 --> 1:20:03.980\n I mean, why do most people work, many biologists work in cancer?\n\n1:20:03.980 --> 1:20:08.140\n Uh, work in cancer research because there's a lot of money there.\n\n1:20:08.140 --> 1:20:14.620\n It's an important problem, but I might not have ever gotten involved in it if there wasn't\n\n1:20:14.620 --> 1:20:14.940\n money.\n\n1:20:14.940 --> 1:20:20.620\n I might've gone and I was going to be a botanist when I, when I was a kid.\n\n1:20:20.620 --> 1:20:21.580\n That's what I wanted to do.\n\n1:20:22.140 --> 1:20:28.460\n Um, so having money available will bring people to bear.\n\n1:20:28.460 --> 1:20:33.420\n Now, another mistake that's often actually made, I think by the lay public about science\n\n1:20:33.420 --> 1:20:36.620\n is that people think that we're paid to do things.\n\n1:20:36.620 --> 1:20:41.260\n Just as you said, I get a research grant and luckily from the NIH there, they give you\n\n1:20:41.260 --> 1:20:42.540\n a fair amount of latitude.\n\n1:20:43.420 --> 1:20:45.580\n I will go my own way and I'll find something.\n\n1:20:45.580 --> 1:20:50.380\n I might've proposed something, but I'll end up somewhere entirely different by the end\n\n1:20:50.380 --> 1:20:51.500\n of the project.\n\n1:20:51.500 --> 1:20:52.860\n And that's how good science is done.\n\n1:20:52.860 --> 1:20:55.900\n You follow the, you follow the data, you follow the results.\n\n1:20:56.700 --> 1:21:01.580\n Um, and so that's what I'm hoping can be done here.\n\n1:21:01.580 --> 1:21:07.500\n I think the worst kind of thing that could be done with this subject area is to put it\n\n1:21:07.500 --> 1:21:13.180\n inside another company where they have a set plan of what it is they're going to do and\n\n1:21:13.180 --> 1:21:17.020\n the scientists either tell, do what the executives tell them to do or not.\n\n1:21:18.300 --> 1:21:20.380\n That isn't how anything will really get discovered.\n\n1:21:21.100 --> 1:21:27.820\n Put it, get it out into the public, get open minds thinking about it and then publishing\n\n1:21:27.820 --> 1:21:29.900\n on it and doing the right kind of work.\n\n1:21:29.900 --> 1:21:32.700\n That's how real progress will be made with this.\n\n1:21:33.740 --> 1:21:37.340\n Let's again, put our sort of philosophical hats on.\n\n1:21:37.340 --> 1:21:45.660\n Do you think the US government or some other government is in possession of something of\n\n1:21:45.660 --> 1:21:53.260\n extraterrestrial origin that is far more impressive than anything we've seen in the public?\n\n1:21:53.980 --> 1:21:59.180\n If I, I've not seen anything personally, but if I believe the people who I don't think\n\n1:21:59.180 --> 1:22:01.260\n can lie, yes.\n\n1:22:02.540 --> 1:22:07.580\n This is how does that make you feel in terms of the way government works, the way our human\n\n1:22:07.580 --> 1:22:13.580\n civilization works, that there might be things like that and we're not, they're not public.\n\n1:22:13.580 --> 1:22:17.100\n Is, is, is there a hopeful message for transparency that's possible?\n\n1:22:17.100 --> 1:22:22.220\n Like if you were, if you were, uh, in power and I'm not saying president because maybe\n\n1:22:22.220 --> 1:22:25.020\n the president is not the source of power here.\n\n1:22:25.020 --> 1:22:29.100\n Would you release this information in some way or form?\n\n1:22:29.100 --> 1:22:36.060\n Yes, if I were, I think it would, I think it's, I think it's something that can bring\n\n1:22:36.060 --> 1:22:38.300\n humanity together, right?\n\n1:22:38.300 --> 1:22:44.940\n I think that knowledge of this kind of thing to know that we are, you know, we are more\n\n1:22:44.940 --> 1:22:53.260\n alike than we are different in comparison to whatever this is, is, uh, is a positive\n\n1:22:53.260 --> 1:22:55.100\n thing for us.\n\n1:22:55.100 --> 1:23:01.180\n Um, and to know, you know, I don't necessarily care that the government has been hiding it.\n\n1:23:01.180 --> 1:23:05.740\n And I think, you know, people who've been talking about what we should give government\n\n1:23:05.740 --> 1:23:10.380\n officials or whatever amnesty, I think that's probably the right, the right answer.\n\n1:23:10.380 --> 1:23:14.140\n We don't, this isn't a time to look back and say, you did something wrong.\n\n1:23:14.140 --> 1:23:17.340\n You did whatever you did because that was the data you had available to you at the time\n\n1:23:17.340 --> 1:23:19.660\n and those, you had good reasons for doing it.\n\n1:23:19.660 --> 1:23:24.780\n Now, if your reasons were selfish, if your reasons where you wanted to do it because\n\n1:23:24.780 --> 1:23:30.940\n you wanted to monetize it yourself, uh, to the, to your benefit, but against that of\n\n1:23:30.940 --> 1:23:36.140\n others, then I think maybe there's something else that could be said, but you know, an\n\n1:23:36.140 --> 1:23:38.220\n opportunity to get all this information out.\n\n1:23:38.220 --> 1:23:41.900\n If I were in charge, I would, I would try to do it.\n\n1:23:41.900 --> 1:23:46.300\n Now I might be shown something though that says, there's a reason why you don't want\n\n1:23:46.300 --> 1:23:47.340\n to let anybody know this.\n\n1:23:47.340 --> 1:23:50.940\n Maybe you don't want to let anybody know this and maybe you don't want everybody have having\n\n1:23:50.940 --> 1:23:57.900\n access to unlimited, uh, energy because maybe you might turn it into a bomb or something\n\n1:23:57.900 --> 1:24:03.820\n that gives you hints that something like unlimited energy is possible, but you haven't figured\n\n1:24:03.820 --> 1:24:04.820\n it out yet.\n\n1:24:04.820 --> 1:24:10.220\n And if you make it public, maybe some of the other governments you have tensions with we'll\n\n1:24:10.220 --> 1:24:11.220\n figure it out first.\n\n1:24:11.220 --> 1:24:12.220\n Right.\n\n1:24:12.220 --> 1:24:17.180\n I mean, it's kind of an arms race going on, I think in all forms and it's, it makes me\n\n1:24:17.180 --> 1:24:25.020\n truly sad because, uh, it's obvious that, um, for example, the origins of the COVID\n\n1:24:25.020 --> 1:24:32.380\n virus, it's obvious to me that the Chinese government, whatever the origins are, is interested\n\n1:24:32.380 --> 1:24:40.940\n in not releasing information about it because it can only be bad for the Chinese government.\n\n1:24:40.940 --> 1:24:46.300\n And every government thinks like this, like every, actually this has been disappointment\n\n1:24:46.300 --> 1:24:54.460\n to me talking to PR folks at companies, like they're always nervous.\n\n1:24:54.460 --> 1:25:00.780\n They're always like conservative in the sense like, well, if we release more stuff, it can\n\n1:25:00.780 --> 1:25:02.320\n only be bad.\n\n1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:08.540\n And then an Elon Musk character comes along who tweets ridiculous memes and doesn't give\n\n1:25:08.540 --> 1:25:10.660\n a fuck.\n\n1:25:10.660 --> 1:25:15.060\n And I've been encouraging CEOs, I've been encouraging people to be transparent.\n\n1:25:15.060 --> 1:25:20.940\n And of course, government is national security is really like another level as human lives\n\n1:25:20.940 --> 1:25:22.380\n at stake.\n\n1:25:22.380 --> 1:25:28.460\n But let's start at the lighter case of just releasing some of the awesome insides of the\n\n1:25:28.460 --> 1:25:34.340\n tech, how, how the sausages made the technology and being transparent about it because it\n\n1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:36.060\n excites people.\n\n1:25:36.060 --> 1:25:42.780\n It uh, like you said, it, it connects people and inspires them.\n\n1:25:42.780 --> 1:25:44.240\n It's a good for the brand.\n\n1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:45.240\n It's good for everybody.\n\n1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:49.940\n I, I honestly think this kind of idea that people will steal the information and we use\n\n1:25:49.940 --> 1:25:56.780\n it against you is, um, is an idea that's not true in his idea of the 20th century.\n\n1:25:56.780 --> 1:26:02.100\n Like you said, some of the benefits of the social media, uh, our, our social world is\n\n1:26:02.100 --> 1:26:06.860\n that transparency is beneficial and I hope governments will learn that lesson.\n\n1:26:06.860 --> 1:26:10.380\n Of course, they're the, usually the last to learn such lessons.\n\n1:26:10.380 --> 1:26:15.340\n What do you make of Bob Lazar's story in terms of possession of aircraft?\n\n1:26:15.340 --> 1:26:16.340\n Do you believe him?\n\n1:26:16.340 --> 1:26:19.260\n I don't believe in the Bob Lazar story to be quite honest.\n\n1:26:19.260 --> 1:26:28.460\n I mean, I, uh, Jeremy Corbell has done a great job interviewing him and, uh, has done some,\n\n1:26:28.460 --> 1:26:31.700\n you know, beautiful, uh, documentaries.\n\n1:26:31.700 --> 1:26:38.540\n Um, I just don't, I, I don't know how to interpret it.\n\n1:26:38.540 --> 1:26:45.100\n And um, you know, and again, there's some of the people who I fraternize with think\n\n1:26:45.100 --> 1:26:46.100\n it's all rubbish.\n\n1:26:46.100 --> 1:26:49.380\n Uh, yeah, but he, maybe he's right, but I don't know.\n\n1:26:49.380 --> 1:26:55.820\n I mean, the, the problem is, and um, this is a little bit different about how I approach\n\n1:26:55.820 --> 1:26:58.620\n the whole area than a lot of others.\n\n1:26:58.620 --> 1:27:04.980\n I'm less interested in going over old paperwork and all these old histories of who said what,\n\n1:27:04.980 --> 1:27:13.220\n you know, the whole, he said, she said of the history of, of UFOs, I'm a scientist.\n\n1:27:13.220 --> 1:27:18.740\n I worked on the brain area because it's something I can collect data on.\n\n1:27:18.740 --> 1:27:22.900\n I can go back to the same individual, collect their MRI again and redo it.\n\n1:27:22.900 --> 1:27:24.620\n I can hand that MRI to somebody else.\n\n1:27:24.620 --> 1:27:26.020\n They can analyze it.\n\n1:27:26.020 --> 1:27:28.740\n I can get materials, I can analyze them.\n\n1:27:28.740 --> 1:27:30.100\n I can get some of these skeletons.\n\n1:27:30.100 --> 1:27:34.100\n I won't touch any skeletons ever again, but I can analyze it and somebody else can reproduce\n\n1:27:34.100 --> 1:27:35.100\n the data.\n\n1:27:35.100 --> 1:27:36.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:36.100 --> 1:27:37.780\n I mean, that's what I'm good at.\n\n1:27:37.780 --> 1:27:43.340\n And so, you know, I'm, I, I, I'm not going to go into the whole, I'm not a historian.\n\n1:27:43.340 --> 1:27:44.480\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:48.060\n But there's a human side to it.\n\n1:27:48.060 --> 1:27:54.300\n I want, sometimes I think with these, because again, anomalous, rare events, some of the\n\n1:27:54.300 --> 1:28:02.620\n data is inextricably connected to humans, the observations, I mean, I hope in the future,\n\n1:28:02.620 --> 1:28:08.740\n you know, that, that, that sensory data will not be polluted by human subjectivity.\n\n1:28:08.740 --> 1:28:14.020\n But you know, that's still, that's still powerful data, even direct observations, like if you\n\n1:28:14.020 --> 1:28:15.020\n talk about pilots.\n\n1:28:15.020 --> 1:28:19.140\n And so it's an interesting question to me, whether Babasar is telling the truth, whether\n\n1:28:19.140 --> 1:28:26.300\n he believes he's telling the truth too, and what also, what impact his story and stories\n\n1:28:26.300 --> 1:28:32.060\n like his have on the willingness of governments to be transparent and so on.\n\n1:28:32.060 --> 1:28:38.700\n So you know, you have to credit his story for captivating the imagination of people\n\n1:28:38.700 --> 1:28:41.120\n and getting the conversation going.\n\n1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:46.100\n He's maintained his story for all these years with little to no change that I'm aware of.\n\n1:28:46.100 --> 1:28:52.820\n So but there's so many other people who are, let's say, experts in that story.\n\n1:28:52.820 --> 1:29:01.620\n Their gut, you know, you accumulate a set of sort of circumstantial evidence where your\n\n1:29:01.620 --> 1:29:04.980\n gut will say that somebody is not telling the truth.\n\n1:29:04.980 --> 1:29:05.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:05.980 --> 1:29:11.860\n You mentioned Avi Loeb, I forgot to ask you about Oumuamua.\n\n1:29:11.860 --> 1:29:17.860\n You know, because you've analyzed specimens here on Earth, what do you make of that one?\n\n1:29:17.860 --> 1:29:23.060\n And what do you make broadly of our efforts to look, look at rocks, essentially, or look\n\n1:29:23.060 --> 1:29:28.160\n at objects flying around in our solar system?\n\n1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:34.020\n Is that a valuable pursuit or maybe most of the stories can be, most of the fascinating\n\n1:29:34.020 --> 1:29:37.980\n things could be discovered here on Earth or on other nearby planets?\n\n1:29:37.980 --> 1:29:46.980\n Just going to Oumuamua, you know, I think Avi's insight is an interesting speculation,\n\n1:29:46.980 --> 1:29:48.540\n right?\n\n1:29:48.540 --> 1:29:51.680\n Like I was saying before, people can sometimes look at something and not see it for what\n\n1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:53.860\n it is.\n\n1:29:53.860 --> 1:29:58.220\n Somebody would just look at that and say, oh, it's an asteroid and dismiss it.\n\n1:29:58.220 --> 1:30:03.500\n There was something odd about the data that Avi picked up on and said, well, here's an\n\n1:30:03.500 --> 1:30:08.220\n alternative explanation that doesn't fit, that actually better fits the models than\n\n1:30:08.220 --> 1:30:10.380\n it just being a rock, you know.\n\n1:30:10.380 --> 1:30:17.460\n And to his credit, he just has ignored the critics because he believes the data is real\n\n1:30:17.460 --> 1:30:22.240\n and is using that then as a battering ram to go after other things.\n\n1:30:22.240 --> 1:30:24.660\n And I think that's, I think that's great.\n\n1:30:24.660 --> 1:30:25.660\n You know?\n\n1:30:25.660 --> 1:30:26.660\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:26.660 --> 1:30:27.660\n What, what is his main conclusion?\n\n1:30:27.660 --> 1:30:31.900\n Does he say it could be of alien extraterrestrial origin?\n\n1:30:31.900 --> 1:30:32.900\n Is that his?\n\n1:30:32.900 --> 1:30:33.900\n Well, that's one of the things.\n\n1:30:33.900 --> 1:30:38.500\n I mean, he, you know, he's explained how it could be a light sale.\n\n1:30:38.500 --> 1:30:44.380\n And a light sale is certainly within near human capabilities to make such a thing.\n\n1:30:44.380 --> 1:30:49.060\n I think Yuri Milner, he's a Russian billionaire.\n\n1:30:49.060 --> 1:30:56.700\n He's involved, I think, in a project to make light sales with laser, you know, to, to launch\n\n1:30:56.700 --> 1:31:03.140\n them with laser power, essentially, towards Alpha Centauri, right?\n\n1:31:03.140 --> 1:31:07.700\n So it's something that humans could make.\n\n1:31:07.700 --> 1:31:11.180\n I think Avi's proposal is perfectly within the realm of possibility.\n\n1:31:11.180 --> 1:31:15.700\n I mean, sadly, the thing is, you know, now nearly out of our solar system.\n\n1:31:15.700 --> 1:31:21.980\n Yes, I mean, to me, that's inspiring to do greater levels of data collection in our solar\n\n1:31:21.980 --> 1:31:23.580\n system, but also here on Earth.\n\n1:31:23.580 --> 1:31:28.020\n And it just seems like we should be constantly collecting, collecting data because the tools\n\n1:31:28.020 --> 1:31:31.620\n of software that we're developing get better and better at dealing with huge amounts of\n\n1:31:31.620 --> 1:31:32.620\n data.\n\n1:31:32.620 --> 1:31:37.020\n It's changing the nature of science, I mean, collect all of the data, right?\n\n1:31:37.020 --> 1:31:38.020\n Collect the data.\n\n1:31:38.020 --> 1:31:43.340\n I mean, I, I, the Galileo project asked me over the weekend to join and I did.\n\n1:31:43.340 --> 1:31:48.720\n So you know, I'm not a specialist in any of the stuff that they're doing.\n\n1:31:48.720 --> 1:31:54.020\n But you know, in looking at the list of people who are on there, there are really no biologists\n\n1:31:54.020 --> 1:31:55.020\n on there.\n\n1:31:55.020 --> 1:31:59.140\n So at, at some point, if my expertise is required for something.\n\n1:31:59.140 --> 1:32:01.600\n What's the goal and the vision of the Galileo project?\n\n1:32:01.600 --> 1:32:06.840\n Better talk to Avi, but my understanding and just actually looking at the, at the sort\n\n1:32:06.840 --> 1:32:12.980\n of the bylaws this morning, literally just got them, is number one, collect the data\n\n1:32:12.980 --> 1:32:13.980\n on UAP.\n\n1:32:13.980 --> 1:32:21.660\n And number two, collect data on local, potentially local technological artifacts.\n\n1:32:21.660 --> 1:32:23.460\n I need to look into this.\n\n1:32:23.460 --> 1:32:24.760\n This is fascinating.\n\n1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:27.020\n And Avi is heading the Galileo project.\n\n1:32:27.020 --> 1:32:28.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:28.020 --> 1:32:29.020\n Have you spoken to him?\n\n1:32:29.020 --> 1:32:30.020\n On this podcast?\n\n1:32:30.020 --> 1:32:31.020\n Yes.\n\n1:32:31.020 --> 1:32:32.020\n That was before, I believe it was before he was headed.\n\n1:32:32.020 --> 1:32:33.020\n Oh.\n\n1:32:33.020 --> 1:32:34.020\n Is this a new creation?\n\n1:32:34.020 --> 1:32:35.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:35.020 --> 1:32:37.700\n The Galileo project was, I think it's about six or seven months old now.\n\n1:32:37.700 --> 1:32:38.700\n Okay.\n\n1:32:38.700 --> 1:32:39.700\n You know.\n\n1:32:39.700 --> 1:32:40.700\n That's amazing.\n\n1:32:40.700 --> 1:32:41.700\n And he's getting a group of scientists together.\n\n1:32:41.700 --> 1:32:42.700\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:32:42.700 --> 1:32:43.700\n That's awesome.\n\n1:32:43.700 --> 1:32:47.740\n Actually, I am, I was looking at some of their stuff over the weekend.\n\n1:32:47.740 --> 1:32:50.940\n I'm shocked at the level of organization that they've already got put together.\n\n1:32:50.940 --> 1:32:51.940\n That's amazing.\n\n1:32:51.940 --> 1:32:53.620\n It looks like a moonshot project.\n\n1:32:53.620 --> 1:32:59.040\n I mean, I've been involved with a lot of NIH, large NIH projects, which involve a lot of\n\n1:32:59.040 --> 1:33:06.120\n people in coordination and they're putting it together.\n\n1:33:06.120 --> 1:33:17.100\n So you're extremely well published in a lot of the fields we began this conversation with.\n\n1:33:17.100 --> 1:33:27.820\n So you're a legit scientist, but yet you're keeping an open mind to a lot of ideas that\n\n1:33:27.820 --> 1:33:33.160\n maybe require you to take a leap outside of the conventional.\n\n1:33:33.160 --> 1:33:40.420\n So what advice would you give to young people today that are in high school or in college\n\n1:33:40.420 --> 1:33:47.720\n that are dreaming of having impact in science or maybe in whatever career path that goes\n\n1:33:47.720 --> 1:33:53.560\n outside of the conventional that really does something new?\n\n1:33:53.560 --> 1:34:01.620\n If you believe in something, you believe that an idea is valuable or you haven't approached\n\n1:34:01.620 --> 1:34:06.740\n something, don't let others shame you into not doing it.\n\n1:34:06.740 --> 1:34:12.840\n As I've said, shame is a societal control device to get other people to do what they\n\n1:34:12.840 --> 1:34:16.620\n want you to do rather than what you want to do.\n\n1:34:16.620 --> 1:34:21.660\n So shame sometimes is good to stop you from doing something unethical or wrong, but shame\n\n1:34:21.660 --> 1:34:27.100\n also is something that is circumscribing your environment.\n\n1:34:27.100 --> 1:34:33.220\n I've never let people who've told me, you shouldn't do that line of science, you should\n\n1:34:33.220 --> 1:34:38.020\n be ashamed of yourself for even thinking that, give me a break.\n\n1:34:38.020 --> 1:34:41.340\n Why is it wrong to ask questions about this area?\n\n1:34:41.340 --> 1:34:43.380\n What's wrong with asking the question?\n\n1:34:43.380 --> 1:34:48.940\n Frankly, you're the person who's wrong for trying to stop these questions.\n\n1:34:48.940 --> 1:34:53.080\n You're the person who's almost acting like a cultist.\n\n1:34:53.080 --> 1:34:58.580\n You basically have closed your mind to what the possibilities are, and if I'm not hurting\n\n1:34:58.580 --> 1:35:04.900\n anybody, and if it could lead to an advance, and if it's my time, why does it bother you?\n\n1:35:04.900 --> 1:35:10.000\n I had a very well known scientist once tell me that I was going to hurt my career talking\n\n1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:11.260\n about this.\n\n1:35:11.260 --> 1:35:13.220\n If anything, it's enhanced my career.\n\n1:35:13.220 --> 1:35:15.160\n I have a couple of questions on this.\n\n1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:18.400\n So first of all, just a small comment on that.\n\n1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:24.700\n I've realized that it feels like a lot of the progress in science is done by people\n\n1:35:24.700 --> 1:35:29.900\n pursuing an idea that another senior faculty would probably say, this is going to hurt\n\n1:35:29.900 --> 1:35:30.900\n your career.\n\n1:35:30.900 --> 1:35:36.100\n I think it's actually a pretty good indicator that there's something interesting when a\n\n1:35:36.100 --> 1:35:40.620\n senior wise person tells you this is going to hurt your career.\n\n1:35:40.620 --> 1:35:45.420\n I think that's just the one, as a small, if I were to give advice to young people, if\n\n1:35:45.420 --> 1:35:49.580\n somebody senior tells you this is going to hurt your career, think twice about taking\n\n1:35:49.580 --> 1:35:50.580\n their advice.\n\n1:35:50.580 --> 1:35:51.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:35:51.580 --> 1:35:54.580\n I mean, I think that's the primary thing.\n\n1:35:54.580 --> 1:36:00.140\n And the other, I tell my own students, I have a lab of about 20, 30 people and it's been\n\n1:36:00.140 --> 1:36:03.500\n that big since 1992.\n\n1:36:03.500 --> 1:36:06.660\n People come and go.\n\n1:36:06.660 --> 1:36:14.020\n It's not the data that falls in line that's so interesting.\n\n1:36:14.020 --> 1:36:21.580\n It's the spot off the graph that you want to understand.\n\n1:36:21.580 --> 1:36:26.060\n When something is way off the graph, that's the interesting thing because that's usually\n\n1:36:26.060 --> 1:36:28.500\n where discovery is.\n\n1:36:28.500 --> 1:36:32.220\n And the number of times that I've stopped people in my lab and said, wait a second,\n\n1:36:32.220 --> 1:36:34.000\n go back a few slides.\n\n1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:35.820\n What was that?\n\n1:36:35.820 --> 1:36:42.580\n And then it ended up being something interesting that made their careers, I could count on\n\n1:36:42.580 --> 1:36:44.140\n a few hands.\n\n1:36:44.140 --> 1:36:45.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:36:45.140 --> 1:36:53.060\n Get excited by the extraordinary that's outside of the thing that you've done in the past.\n\n1:36:53.060 --> 1:37:01.780\n Just on a personal psychological level, is there, I'm sure at Stanford, I'm sure in you\n\n1:37:01.780 --> 1:37:05.020\n exploring some of these ideas, there's pressure.\n\n1:37:05.020 --> 1:37:09.820\n How do you not give in to the pressure?\n\n1:37:09.820 --> 1:37:17.980\n How do you not give in to the people that push you away from these topics?\n\n1:37:17.980 --> 1:37:19.460\n What would you say is shame?\n\n1:37:19.460 --> 1:37:22.060\n I just point to my successes.\n\n1:37:22.060 --> 1:37:28.520\n I say, you're the ones who told me not to start companies all this time ago.\n\n1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:34.900\n And now you're the one coming to me for advice for how to start a company.\n\n1:37:34.900 --> 1:37:43.000\n But from the scientific area, it's you're wanting to take something off the table that\n\n1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:47.740\n might be an explanation.\n\n1:37:47.740 --> 1:37:50.860\n How is that the scientific method?\n\n1:37:50.860 --> 1:37:54.220\n I reverse shame them.\n\n1:37:54.220 --> 1:37:56.860\n So purely with reason through conversation, you're able to do that.\n\n1:37:56.860 --> 1:37:59.700\n So it doesn't feel, because to me it would just feel lonely.\n\n1:37:59.700 --> 1:38:01.540\n There's a community.\n\n1:38:01.540 --> 1:38:08.700\n There's a community of science, and when you're working on something that's outside a particular\n\n1:38:08.700 --> 1:38:12.180\n conventional way of thinking, it can be lonely.\n\n1:38:12.180 --> 1:38:17.620\n There's in the AI field, if you were working on neural networks in the 90s, it could be\n\n1:38:17.620 --> 1:38:18.700\n lonely.\n\n1:38:18.700 --> 1:38:23.820\n I have met some of the most fascinating people ever that had I stayed the conventional track,\n\n1:38:23.820 --> 1:38:26.260\n I would never have met.\n\n1:38:26.260 --> 1:38:31.160\n Truly brilliant people because of this.\n\n1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:40.460\n So it is for those worried about, well, should I step outside of my comfort zone?\n\n1:38:40.460 --> 1:38:42.900\n You're going to meet some really interesting people.\n\n1:38:42.900 --> 1:38:51.860\n And because I'm open about this area, I'll go and give a talk in Boston, Harvard or MIT.\n\n1:38:51.860 --> 1:38:57.140\n And at dinner, inevitably, this subject comes up.\n\n1:38:57.140 --> 1:39:01.460\n And inevitably somebody else at the table will admit both that they're interested or\n\n1:39:01.460 --> 1:39:03.520\n that they've seen something.\n\n1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:07.020\n And suddenly the whole tone of the conversation changes.\n\n1:39:07.020 --> 1:39:13.380\n It's kind of like there's safety in numbers and then, or I've had people come to me afterwards\n\n1:39:13.380 --> 1:39:19.420\n after dinner and say, Hey, I don't talk about this openly, but.\n\n1:39:19.420 --> 1:39:27.660\n So the number of scientists who know that there's something else going on is much larger\n\n1:39:27.660 --> 1:39:32.220\n than the scientific community would like to think.\n\n1:39:32.220 --> 1:39:38.220\n That's a really powerful one, which is, I don't talk about this openly, but here's what\n\n1:39:38.220 --> 1:39:40.240\n I believe.\n\n1:39:40.240 --> 1:39:44.780\n And you'd be surprised how many people speak like this and hold those beliefs.\n\n1:39:44.780 --> 1:39:50.260\n And I am optimistic about social media and a more connected world to reveal more and\n\n1:39:50.260 --> 1:39:56.100\n more, like us not to have these two personalities, we're like this public and private one.\n\n1:39:56.100 --> 1:39:59.140\n We've mentioned the big questions of the origins of the universe.\n\n1:39:59.140 --> 1:40:06.700\n What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing for us humans, our human existence here\n\n1:40:06.700 --> 1:40:10.940\n on earth, or just at the individual level of a human life?\n\n1:40:10.940 --> 1:40:15.820\n What Gary is the meaning of life.\n\n1:40:15.820 --> 1:40:25.300\n I think that what we're going through today with this realization, it's kind of like you've\n\n1:40:25.300 --> 1:40:32.420\n lived on an island your whole life and you've looked across the ocean and you've never imagined\n\n1:40:32.420 --> 1:40:35.380\n there was another island with anybody else on it.\n\n1:40:35.380 --> 1:40:39.980\n And then suddenly a ship with sails shows up.\n\n1:40:39.980 --> 1:40:45.740\n You don't understand it, but you realize that suddenly your world just got a lot bigger.\n\n1:40:45.740 --> 1:40:52.960\n I think we're in one of those moments right now that our world view, our galactic view\n\n1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:55.940\n is opening to something a little bit bigger.\n\n1:40:55.940 --> 1:41:03.760\n And not just that there might be somebody else, but that there's something else.\n\n1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:06.940\n And what it is, is yet to be understood.\n\n1:41:06.940 --> 1:41:13.660\n And the fact that it isn't understood to me is what's exciting because I can fill it with\n\n1:41:13.660 --> 1:41:16.300\n my dreams.\n\n1:41:16.300 --> 1:41:25.580\n And this discovery our world might is about to get a lot more humbling and a lot more\n\n1:41:25.580 --> 1:41:30.620\n fascinating once we look out and realize we were on an island all along.\n\n1:41:30.620 --> 1:41:34.780\n It makes us both smaller but larger at the same time to me.\n\n1:41:34.780 --> 1:41:42.140\n You know, I can look outside at the stars and think and imagine what else might be out\n\n1:41:42.140 --> 1:41:43.140\n there.\n\n1:41:43.140 --> 1:41:50.300\n And although I know that I will never see it all, it excites me to know that it's there.\n\n1:41:50.300 --> 1:41:58.740\n Well Gary, both to respect your time and also because at 12 I turned into a princess, let\n\n1:41:58.740 --> 1:42:05.700\n me just say thank you for doing everything you're doing as a great scientist, as a person\n\n1:42:05.700 --> 1:42:10.780\n willing to reject the conventional, and thank you for spending your extremely valuable time\n\n1:42:10.780 --> 1:42:11.780\n with me today.\n\n1:42:11.780 --> 1:42:12.780\n Thanks for talking.\n\n1:42:12.780 --> 1:42:13.780\n Thanks so much.\n\n1:42:13.780 --> 1:42:15.060\n It was great talking.\n\n1:42:15.060 --> 1:42:17.300\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Gary Nolan.\n\n1:42:17.300 --> 1:42:21.620\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n1:42:21.620 --> 1:42:27.460\n And now let me leave you with some words from Stanislav Lem in Solaris.\n\n1:42:27.460 --> 1:42:34.860\n How do you expect to communicate with the ocean when we can't even understand one another?\n\n1:42:34.860 --> 1:42:58.380\n Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
