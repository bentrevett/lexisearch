following is a conversation with Donald Hoffman,\n\n00:14.920 --> 00:17.920\n professor of cognitive sciences at UC Irvine,\n\n00:17.920 --> 00:21.200\n focusing his research on evolutionary psychology,\n\n00:21.200 --> 00:23.920\n visual perception, and consciousness.\n\n00:23.920 --> 00:27.760\n He's the author of over 120 scientific papers\n\n00:27.760 --> 00:30.320\n on these topics and his most recent book\n\n00:30.320 --> 00:33.280\n titled The Case Against Reality,\n\n00:33.280 --> 00:35.840\n Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes.\n\n00:36.700 --> 00:39.600\n I think some of the most interesting ideas in this world,\n\n00:39.600 --> 00:41.400\n like those of Donald Hoffman's,\n\n00:41.400 --> 00:43.640\n attempt to shake the foundation\n\n00:43.640 --> 00:45.920\n of our understanding of reality,\n\n00:45.920 --> 00:50.320\n and thus they take a long time to internalize deeply.\n\n00:50.320 --> 00:52.240\n So proceed with caution.\n\n00:52.240 --> 00:54.440\n Questioning the fabric of reality\n\n00:54.440 --> 00:58.520\n can lead you to either madness or to truth.\n\n00:58.520 --> 01:01.400\n And the funny thing is, you won't know which is which.\n\n01:02.440 --> 01:04.260\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:04.260 --> 01:06.420\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:06.420 --> 01:07.640\n in the description.\n\n01:07.640 --> 01:11.100\n And now, dear friends, here's Donald Hoffman.\n\n01:12.040 --> 01:14.300\n In your book, The Case Against Reality,\n\n01:14.300 --> 01:17.200\n Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes,\n\n01:17.200 --> 01:20.000\n you make the bold claim that the world we see\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:21.960\n with our eyes is not real.\n\n01:21.960 --> 01:24.560\n It's not even an abstraction of objective reality.\n\n01:24.560 --> 01:28.800\n It is completely detached from objective reality.\n\n01:29.680 --> 01:30.880\n Can you explain this idea?\n\n01:30.880 --> 01:32.400\n Right, so this is a theorem\n\n01:32.400 --> 01:34.160\n from evolution by natural selection.\n\n01:34.160 --> 01:38.540\n So the technical question that I and my team asked was,\n\n01:38.540 --> 01:41.380\n what is the probability that natural selection\n\n01:41.380 --> 01:43.000\n would shape sensory systems\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:45.400\n to see true properties of objective reality?\n\n01:46.240 --> 01:47.440\n And to our surprise,\n\n01:47.440 --> 01:49.320\n we found that the answer is precisely zero,\n\n01:49.320 --> 01:51.400\n except for one kind of structure\n\n01:51.400 --> 01:52.480\n that we can go into if you want to.\n\n01:52.480 --> 01:54.640\n But for any generic structure\n\n01:54.640 --> 01:56.240\n that you might think the world might have,\n\n01:56.240 --> 01:59.160\n a total order, a topology, metric,\n\n02:00.280 --> 02:02.300\n the probability is precisely zero\n\n02:02.300 --> 02:05.300\n that natural selection would shape any sensory system\n\n02:05.300 --> 02:08.560\n of any organism to see any aspect of objective reality.\n\n02:08.560 --> 02:11.680\n So in that sense, what we're seeing\n\n02:11.680 --> 02:15.680\n is what we need to see\n\n02:16.600 --> 02:18.960\n to stay alive long enough to reproduce.\n\n02:18.960 --> 02:20.640\n So in other words, we're seeing what we need\n\n02:20.640 --> 02:23.480\n to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.\n\n02:23.480 --> 02:26.080\n So the evolutionary process,\n\n02:26.080 --> 02:30.100\n the process that took us from the origin of life on Earth\n\n02:30.100 --> 02:32.320\n to the humans that we are today,\n\n02:33.260 --> 02:37.320\n that process does not maximize for truth,\n\n02:37.320 --> 02:41.280\n it maximizes for fitness, as you say, fitness beats truth.\n\n02:41.280 --> 02:45.000\n And fitness does not have to be connected to truth,\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:46.680\n is the claim.\n\n02:46.680 --> 02:49.000\n And that's where you have an approach\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:51.320\n towards zero of probability\n\n02:51.320 --> 02:55.940\n that we have evolved human cognition,\n\n02:55.940 --> 02:58.340\n human consciousness, whatever it is,\n\n02:58.340 --> 03:00.640\n the magic that makes our mind work,\n\n03:00.640 --> 03:05.640\n evolved not for its ability to see the truth of reality,\n\n03:06.240 --> 03:09.160\n but its ability to survive in the environment.\n\n03:09.160 --> 03:10.240\n That's exactly right.\n\n03:10.240 --> 03:14.200\n So most of us intuitively think that surely\n\n03:14.200 --> 03:18.600\n the way that evolution will make our senses more fit\n\n03:18.600 --> 03:21.120\n is to make them tell us more truths,\n\n03:21.120 --> 03:22.960\n or at least the truths we need to know\n\n03:22.960 --> 03:26.100\n about objective reality, the truths we need in our niche.\n\n03:26.100 --> 03:27.960\n That's the standard view, and it was the view I took.\n\n03:27.960 --> 03:30.520\n I mean, that's sort of what we're taught\n\n03:30.520 --> 03:31.840\n or just even assume.\n\n03:31.840 --> 03:33.460\n It was just sort of like the intelligent assumption\n\n03:33.460 --> 03:34.720\n that we would all make.\n\n03:34.720 --> 03:37.860\n But we don't have to just wave our hands.\n\n03:37.860 --> 03:38.940\n Evolution of a natural selection\n\n03:38.940 --> 03:41.220\n is a mathematically precise theory.\n\n03:41.220 --> 03:44.200\n John Maynard Smith in the 70s\n\n03:44.200 --> 03:45.600\n created evolutionary game theory.\n\n03:45.600 --> 03:48.140\n And we have evolutionary graph theory\n\n03:48.140 --> 03:50.520\n and even genetic algorithms that we can use to study this.\n\n03:50.520 --> 03:52.360\n And so we don't have to wave our hands.\n\n03:52.360 --> 03:55.480\n It's a matter of theorem and proof and or simulation\n\n03:55.480 --> 03:56.740\n before you get the theorems and proofs.\n\n03:56.740 --> 03:59.440\n And a couple of graduate students of mine,\n\n03:59.440 --> 04:01.180\n Chester Mark and Brian Marion,\n\n04:01.180 --> 04:03.960\n did some wonderful simulations that tipped me off\n\n04:03.960 --> 04:06.480\n that there was something going on here.\n\n04:06.480 --> 04:08.960\n And then I went to a mathematician, Chetan Prakash,\n\n04:08.960 --> 04:13.040\n and Manish Singh, and some other friends of mine,\n\n04:13.040 --> 04:14.440\n Chris Fields.\n\n04:14.440 --> 04:17.000\n But Chetan was the real mathematician behind all this.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:18.560\n And he's proved several theorems\n\n04:18.560 --> 04:21.800\n that uniformly indicate that with one exception,\n\n04:21.800 --> 04:23.900\n which has to do with probability measures,\n\n04:25.160 --> 04:28.240\n there's no, the probability is zero.\n\n04:28.240 --> 04:30.920\n The reason there's an exception for probability measures,\n\n04:30.920 --> 04:35.920\n so called sigma algebras or sigma additive classes,\n\n04:36.680 --> 04:38.780\n is that for any scientific theory,\n\n04:40.680 --> 04:43.400\n there is the assumption that needs to be made\n\n04:43.400 --> 04:48.400\n that whatever structure,\n\n04:48.640 --> 04:51.760\n whatever probabilistic structure the world may have\n\n04:51.760 --> 04:55.520\n is not unrelated to the probabilistic structure\n\n04:55.520 --> 04:56.360\n of our perceptions.\n\n04:56.360 --> 04:57.360\n If they were completely unrelated,\n\n04:57.360 --> 04:59.560\n then no science would be possible.\n\n04:59.560 --> 05:04.560\n So this is technically the map from reality to our senses\n\n05:05.080 --> 05:07.000\n has to be a so called measurable map,\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:08.640\n has to preserve sigma algebras.\n\n05:08.640 --> 05:10.360\n But that means it could be infinite to one,\n\n05:10.360 --> 05:14.320\n and it could collapse all sorts of event information.\n\n05:14.320 --> 05:17.040\n But other than that, there's no requirement\n\n05:17.040 --> 05:18.960\n in standard evolutionary theory\n\n05:18.960 --> 05:22.460\n for fitness payoff functions, for example,\n\n05:22.460 --> 05:25.560\n to preserve any specific structures of objective reality.\n\n05:25.560 --> 05:27.120\n So you can ask the technical question.\n\n05:27.120 --> 05:29.180\n This is one of the avenues we took.\n\n05:30.920 --> 05:32.920\n If you look at all the fitness payoffs\n\n05:32.920 --> 05:37.960\n from whatever world structure you might want to imagine.\n\n05:37.960 --> 05:40.460\n So a world with say a total order on it.\n\n05:41.360 --> 05:44.100\n So it's got end states and they're totally ordered.\n\n05:44.100 --> 05:48.160\n And then you can have a set of maps from that world\n\n05:48.160 --> 05:50.560\n into a set of payoffs, say from zero to a thousand\n\n05:50.560 --> 05:52.560\n or whatever you want your payoffs to be.\n\n05:52.560 --> 05:56.240\n And you can just literally count all the payoff functions\n\n05:56.240 --> 05:58.120\n and just do the combinatorics and count them.\n\n05:58.120 --> 05:59.840\n And then you can ask the precise question,\n\n05:59.840 --> 06:04.000\n how many of those payoff functions preserve the total order?\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:04.840\n If that's what you're looking for,\n\n06:04.840 --> 06:07.320\n or how many preserve the topology?\n\n06:07.320 --> 06:08.800\n And you just count them and divide.\n\n06:08.800 --> 06:11.880\n So the number that are homomorphisms\n\n06:11.880 --> 06:14.160\n versus the total number, and then take the limit\n\n06:14.160 --> 06:16.660\n as the number of states in the world\n\n06:16.660 --> 06:19.960\n and the number of payoff values goes very large.\n\n06:19.960 --> 06:21.600\n And when you do that, you get zero every time.\n\n06:21.600 --> 06:24.400\n Okay, there's a million things to ask here.\n\n06:24.400 --> 06:28.240\n But first of all, just in case people\n\n06:28.240 --> 06:29.920\n are not familiar with your work,\n\n06:30.880 --> 06:35.880\n let's sort of linger on the big bold statement here,\n\n06:35.880 --> 06:39.400\n which is the thing we see with our eyes\n\n06:41.040 --> 06:45.040\n is not some kind of limited window into reality.\n\n06:45.040 --> 06:47.860\n It is completely detached from reality,\n\n06:47.860 --> 06:49.600\n likely completely detached from reality.\n\n06:49.600 --> 06:51.240\n You're saying 100% likely.\n\n06:52.580 --> 06:57.580\n Okay, so none of this is real in the way we think is real.\n\n06:57.780 --> 07:00.000\n In the way we have this intuition,\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:05.000\n there's like this table is some kind of abstraction,\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:07.880\n but underneath it all, there's atoms.\n\n07:07.880 --> 07:09.880\n And there's an entire century of physics\n\n07:09.880 --> 07:12.040\n that describes the functioning of those atoms\n\n07:12.040 --> 07:13.720\n and the quirks that make them up.\n\n07:13.720 --> 07:18.720\n There's many Nobel Prizes about particles and fields\n\n07:19.840 --> 07:23.320\n and all that kind of stuff that slowly builds up\n\n07:23.320 --> 07:25.200\n to something that's perceivable to us,\n\n07:25.200 --> 07:29.960\n both with our eyes, with our different senses as this table.\n\n07:29.960 --> 07:33.560\n Then there's also ideas of chemistry\n\n07:33.560 --> 07:38.560\n that over layers of abstraction, from DNA to embryos,\n\n07:38.600 --> 07:42.960\n the cells that make the human body.\n\n07:42.960 --> 07:46.660\n So all of that is not real.\n\n07:46.660 --> 07:48.320\n It's a real experience,\n\n07:48.320 --> 07:52.560\n and it's a real adaptive set of perceptions.\n\n07:52.560 --> 07:56.200\n So it's an adaptive set of perceptions, full stop.\n\n07:56.200 --> 07:58.640\n We want to think that the perceptions are real.\n\n07:58.640 --> 08:01.720\n So their perceptions are real as perceptions, right?\n\n08:01.720 --> 08:03.640\n We are having our perceptions,\n\n08:03.640 --> 08:06.920\n but we've assumed that there's a pretty tight relationship\n\n08:06.920 --> 08:09.000\n between our perceptions and reality.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.720\n If I look up and see the moon,\n\n08:11.720 --> 08:15.160\n then there is something that exists in space and time\n\n08:15.160 --> 08:18.960\n that matches what I perceive.\n\n08:18.960 --> 08:23.960\n And all I'm saying is that if you take evolution\n\n08:24.600 --> 08:29.600\n by natural selection seriously, then that is precluded.\n\n08:29.600 --> 08:31.880\n That our perceptions are there.\n\n08:31.880 --> 08:35.160\n They're there to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.\n\n08:35.160 --> 08:36.720\n They're not there to show you the truth.\n\n08:36.720 --> 08:38.760\n In fact, the way I think about it is\n\n08:38.760 --> 08:40.660\n they're there to hide the truth\n\n08:40.660 --> 08:42.520\n because the truth is too complicated.\n\n08:42.520 --> 08:45.720\n It's just like if you're trying to use your laptop\n\n08:45.720 --> 08:47.480\n to write an email, right?\n\n08:47.480 --> 08:50.280\n What you're doing is toggling voltages in the computer,\n\n08:50.280 --> 08:52.600\n but good luck trying to do it that way.\n\n08:52.600 --> 08:54.280\n The reason why we have a user interface\n\n08:54.280 --> 08:56.600\n is because we don't want to know that quote unquote truth,\n\n08:56.600 --> 08:59.600\n the diodes and resistors and all that terrible hardware.\n\n08:59.600 --> 09:02.040\n If you had to know all that truth,\n\n09:02.040 --> 09:04.000\n your friends wouldn't hear from you.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:08.360\n So what evolution gave us was perceptions\n\n09:08.360 --> 09:10.200\n that guide adaptive behavior.\n\n09:10.200 --> 09:12.000\n And part of that process, it turns out,\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:16.680\n means hiding the truth and giving you eye candy.\n\n09:16.680 --> 09:20.700\n So what's the difference between hiding the truth\n\n09:20.700 --> 09:22.840\n and forming abstractions,\n\n09:22.840 --> 09:26.560\n layers upon layers of abstractions\n\n09:26.560 --> 09:30.320\n over low level voltages and transistors\n\n09:30.320 --> 09:35.320\n and chips and programming languages\n\n09:35.480 --> 09:38.560\n from assembly to Python that then leads you\n\n09:38.560 --> 09:41.040\n to be able to have an interface like Chrome\n\n09:41.040 --> 09:45.780\n where you open up another set of JavaScript and HTML\n\n09:45.780 --> 09:47.360\n programming languages that lead you\n\n09:47.360 --> 09:49.360\n to have a graphical user interface\n\n09:49.360 --> 09:53.040\n and which you can then send your friends an email.\n\n09:53.040 --> 09:58.040\n Is that completely detached from the zeros and ones\n\n09:58.480 --> 10:01.560\n that are firing away inside the computer?\n\n10:01.560 --> 10:02.880\n It's not.\n\n10:02.880 --> 10:04.800\n Of course, when I talk about the user interface\n\n10:04.800 --> 10:09.800\n on your desktop, there's this whole sophisticated\n\n10:10.120 --> 10:11.540\n backstory to it, right?\n\n10:11.540 --> 10:13.120\n That the hardware and the software\n\n10:13.120 --> 10:15.040\n that's allowing that to happen.\n\n10:15.040 --> 10:17.200\n Evolution doesn't tell us the backstory, right?\n\n10:17.200 --> 10:20.400\n So the theory of evolution is not going to be adequate\n\n10:20.400 --> 10:23.040\n to tell you what is that backstory.\n\n10:23.040 --> 10:27.160\n It's gonna say that whatever reality is,\n\n10:27.160 --> 10:28.000\n and that's the interesting thing,\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:31.260\n it says whatever reality is, you don't see it.\n\n10:31.260 --> 10:32.600\n You see a user interface,\n\n10:32.600 --> 10:36.900\n but it doesn't tell you what that user interface is,\n\n10:36.900 --> 10:38.840\n how it's built, right?\n\n10:38.840 --> 10:42.600\n Now, we can try to look at certain aspects\n\n10:42.600 --> 10:45.400\n of the interface, but already we're gonna look at that\n\n10:45.400 --> 10:47.960\n and go, okay, before I would look at neurons\n\n10:47.960 --> 10:49.640\n and I was assuming that I was seeing something\n\n10:49.640 --> 10:52.840\n that was at least partially true.\n\n10:52.840 --> 10:54.880\n And now I'm realizing that it could be like looking\n\n10:54.880 --> 10:59.240\n at the pixels on my desktop or icons on my desktop\n\n10:59.240 --> 11:02.600\n and good luck going from that to the data structures\n\n11:02.600 --> 11:04.840\n and then the voltages and I mean, good luck.\n\n11:04.840 --> 11:06.960\n There's just no way.\n\n11:06.960 --> 11:08.600\n So what's interesting about this is that\n\n11:08.600 --> 11:13.000\n our scientific theories are precise enough\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.640\n and rigorous enough to tell us certain limits,\n\n11:17.160 --> 11:20.040\n but, and even limits of the theories themselves,\n\n11:20.040 --> 11:23.240\n but they're not going to tell us what the next move is\n\n11:23.240 --> 11:25.880\n and that's where scientific creativity comes in.\n\n11:25.880 --> 11:28.960\n So the stuff that I'm saying here, for example,\n\n11:28.960 --> 11:31.040\n is not alien to physicists.\n\n11:31.040 --> 11:33.680\n The physicists are saying precisely the same thing\n\n11:33.680 --> 11:35.240\n that space time is doomed.\n\n11:35.240 --> 11:37.240\n We've assumed that space time is fundamental.\n\n11:37.240 --> 11:39.360\n We've assumed that for several centuries\n\n11:39.360 --> 11:40.760\n and it's been very useful.\n\n11:40.760 --> 11:41.980\n So all the things that you were mentioning,\n\n11:41.980 --> 11:43.920\n the particles and all the work that's been done,\n\n11:43.920 --> 11:45.120\n that's all been done in space time,\n\n11:45.120 --> 11:47.520\n but now physicists are saying space time is doomed.\n\n11:47.520 --> 11:51.720\n There's no such thing as space time fundamentally\n\n11:51.720 --> 11:54.080\n in the laws of physics.\n\n11:54.080 --> 11:58.580\n And that comes actually out of gravity\n\n11:58.580 --> 11:59.920\n together with quantum field theory,\n\n11:59.920 --> 12:01.080\n which just comes right out of it.\n\n12:01.080 --> 12:05.640\n It's a theorem of those two theories put together,\n\n12:05.640 --> 12:08.000\n but it doesn't tell you what's behind it.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:11.880\n So the physicists know that their best theories,\n\n12:11.880 --> 12:15.160\n Einstein's gravity and quantum field theory put together\n\n12:15.160 --> 12:17.440\n entail that space time cannot be fundamental\n\n12:17.440 --> 12:20.880\n and therefore particles in space time cannot be fundamental.\n\n12:20.880 --> 12:22.520\n They're just irreducible representations\n\n12:22.520 --> 12:23.760\n of the symmetries of space time.\n\n12:23.760 --> 12:24.760\n That's what they are.\n\n12:24.760 --> 12:27.600\n So we have, so space time, so we put the two together.\n\n12:27.600 --> 12:29.700\n We put together what the physicists are discovering\n\n12:29.700 --> 12:32.200\n and we can talk about how they do that.\n\n12:32.200 --> 12:33.780\n And then we, the new discoveries\n\n12:33.780 --> 12:35.360\n from evolution of a natural selection.\n\n12:35.360 --> 12:38.740\n Both of these discoveries are really in the last 20 years.\n\n12:38.740 --> 12:41.520\n And what both are saying is space time\n\n12:41.520 --> 12:42.520\n has had a good ride.\n\n12:43.520 --> 12:44.360\n It's been very useful.\n\n12:44.360 --> 12:46.520\n Reductionism has been useful, but it's over.\n\n12:46.520 --> 12:48.400\n And it's time for us to go beyond.\n\n12:48.400 --> 12:50.520\n When you say space time is doomed,\n\n12:50.520 --> 12:53.200\n is it the space, is it the time,\n\n12:53.200 --> 12:57.640\n is it the very hard coded specification of four dimensions?\n\n12:59.800 --> 13:01.560\n Or are you specifically referring\n\n13:01.560 --> 13:05.160\n to the kind of perceptual domain\n\n13:05.160 --> 13:07.360\n that humans operate in, which is space time?\n\n13:07.360 --> 13:12.080\n You think like there's a 3D, like our world\n\n13:12.080 --> 13:15.440\n is three dimensional and time progresses forward.\n\n13:15.440 --> 13:18.120\n Therefore, three dimensions plus one, 4D.\n\n13:18.120 --> 13:20.560\n What exactly do you mean by space time?\n\n13:20.560 --> 13:24.080\n And what do you mean by space time is doomed?\n\n13:24.080 --> 13:24.920\n Great, great.\n\n13:24.920 --> 13:26.600\n So this is, by the way, not my quote.\n\n13:26.600 --> 13:29.880\n This is from, for example, Nima Arkanihaim Ed\n\n13:29.880 --> 13:31.760\n at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.\n\n13:31.760 --> 13:34.340\n Ed Witten, also there.\n\n13:34.340 --> 13:36.560\n David Gross, Nobel Prize winner.\n\n13:36.560 --> 13:39.360\n So this is not just something the cognitive scientists,\n\n13:39.360 --> 13:40.680\n this is what the physicists are saying.\n\n13:40.680 --> 13:45.120\n Yeah, the physicists, they're space time skeptics.\n\n13:45.120 --> 13:46.680\n Well, yeah, they're saying that,\n\n13:46.680 --> 13:49.600\n and I can say exactly why they think it's doomed.\n\n13:49.600 --> 13:51.640\n But what they're saying is that,\n\n13:51.640 --> 13:53.880\n because your question was what aspect of space time,\n\n13:53.880 --> 13:55.000\n what are we talking about here?\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.920\n It's both space and time.\n\n13:56.920 --> 13:59.760\n They're union into space time as an Einstein's theory.\n\n13:59.760 --> 14:01.280\n That's doomed.\n\n14:01.280 --> 14:06.280\n And they're basically saying that even quantum theory,\n\n14:06.960 --> 14:09.240\n this is with Nima Arkanihaim Ed, especially.\n\n14:09.240 --> 14:12.920\n So Hilbert spaces will not be fundamental either.\n\n14:12.920 --> 14:15.560\n So that the notion of Hilbert space,\n\n14:15.560 --> 14:19.000\n which is really critical to quantum field theory,\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\n quantum information theory,\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:22.000\n that's not going to figure\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:25.280\n in the fundamental new laws of physics.\n\n14:25.280 --> 14:26.840\n So what they're looking for\n\n14:26.840 --> 14:31.840\n is some new mathematical structures beyond space time,\n\n14:31.960 --> 14:35.240\n beyond Einstein's four dimensional space time\n\n14:35.240 --> 14:38.040\n or super symmetric version,\n\n14:38.040 --> 14:41.160\n geometric algebra signature two comma four kind of.\n\n14:41.160 --> 14:43.280\n There are different ways that you can represent it,\n\n14:43.280 --> 14:45.560\n but they're finding new structures.\n\n14:45.560 --> 14:47.320\n And then by the way, they're succeeding now.\n\n14:47.320 --> 14:48.440\n They're finding, they found something\n\n14:48.440 --> 14:49.680\n called the amplituhedron.\n\n14:49.680 --> 14:51.520\n This is Nima and his colleagues,\n\n14:51.520 --> 14:53.600\n the cosmological polytope.\n\n14:53.600 --> 14:57.400\n So there are these like polytopes,\n\n14:57.400 --> 15:00.320\n these polyhedra in multi dimensions,\n\n15:00.320 --> 15:05.320\n generalizations of simplices that are coding for,\n\n15:05.720 --> 15:08.240\n for example, the scattering amplitudes of processes\n\n15:08.240 --> 15:10.880\n in the Large Hadron Collider and other colliders.\n\n15:10.880 --> 15:14.040\n So they're finding that if they let go of space time,\n\n15:14.040 --> 15:16.960\n completely, they're finding new ways\n\n15:16.960 --> 15:18.760\n of computing these scattering amplitudes\n\n15:18.760 --> 15:23.760\n that turn literally billions of terms into one term.\n\n15:23.760 --> 15:25.040\n When you do it in space and time,\n\n15:25.040 --> 15:26.800\n because it's the wrong framework,\n\n15:26.800 --> 15:29.560\n it's just a user interface from,\n\n15:29.560 --> 15:30.920\n that's not from the evolutionary point of view,\n\n15:30.920 --> 15:32.160\n it's just user interface.\n\n15:32.160 --> 15:34.600\n It's not a deep insight into the nature of reality.\n\n15:34.600 --> 15:36.920\n So it's missing deep symmetry\n\n15:36.920 --> 15:39.040\n is something called a dual conformal symmetry,\n\n15:39.040 --> 15:40.960\n which turns out to be true of the scattering data,\n\n15:40.960 --> 15:42.720\n but you can't see it in space time.\n\n15:42.720 --> 15:46.280\n And it's making the computations way too complicated\n\n15:46.280 --> 15:47.920\n because you're trying to compute all the loops\n\n15:47.920 --> 15:50.320\n in the Feynman diagrams and all the Feynman integrals.\n\n15:50.320 --> 15:53.000\n So see the Feynman approach to the scattering amplitudes\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.520\n is trying to enforce two critical properties of space time,\n\n15:56.520 --> 15:58.600\n locality and unitarity.\n\n15:58.600 --> 16:00.440\n And so by, when you enforce those,\n\n16:00.440 --> 16:03.400\n you get all these loops and multiple,\n\n16:03.400 --> 16:04.600\n different levels of loops.\n\n16:04.600 --> 16:05.440\n And for each of those,\n\n16:05.440 --> 16:07.600\n you have to add new terms to your computation.\n\n16:07.600 --> 16:11.080\n But when you do it outside of space time,\n\n16:11.080 --> 16:13.800\n you don't have the notion of unitarity.\n\n16:13.800 --> 16:15.760\n You don't have the notion of locality.\n\n16:15.760 --> 16:17.320\n You have something deeper\n\n16:17.320 --> 16:18.840\n and it's capturing some symmetries\n\n16:18.840 --> 16:20.800\n that are actually true of the data.\n\n16:20.800 --> 16:23.000\n And, but then when you look at the geometry\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.360\n of the facets of these polytopes,\n\n16:25.360 --> 16:30.360\n then certain of them will code for unitarity and locality.\n\n16:30.800 --> 16:32.400\n So it actually comes out of the structure\n\n16:32.400 --> 16:33.520\n of these deep polytopes.\n\n16:33.520 --> 16:36.520\n So what we're finding is there's this whole new world.\n\n16:36.520 --> 16:41.520\n Now beyond space time that is making explicit symmetries\n\n16:42.080 --> 16:43.000\n that are true of the data\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.040\n that cannot be seen in space time.\n\n16:45.040 --> 16:46.720\n And that is turning the computations\n\n16:46.720 --> 16:50.400\n from billions of terms to one or two or a handful of terms.\n\n16:50.400 --> 16:53.280\n So we're getting insights into symmetries\n\n16:53.280 --> 16:55.400\n and all of a sudden the math is becoming simple\n\n16:55.400 --> 16:56.880\n because we're not doing something silly.\n\n16:56.880 --> 16:59.040\n We're not adding up all these loops in space time.\n\n16:59.040 --> 17:00.840\n We're doing something far deeper.\n\n17:00.840 --> 17:02.840\n But they don't know what this world is about.\n\n17:02.840 --> 17:05.880\n Also, they're in an interesting position\n\n17:07.080 --> 17:09.080\n where we know that space time is doomed.\n\n17:09.080 --> 17:11.360\n And I should probably tell you why it's doomed,\n\n17:11.360 --> 17:12.840\n what they're saying about why it's doomed.\n\n17:12.840 --> 17:15.600\n But they need a flashlight to look beyond space time.\n\n17:15.600 --> 17:17.400\n What flashlight are we gonna use\n\n17:17.400 --> 17:19.720\n to look into the dark beyond space time?\n\n17:19.720 --> 17:22.280\n Because Einstein's theory and quantum theory\n\n17:22.280 --> 17:23.920\n can't tell us what's beyond them.\n\n17:23.920 --> 17:26.240\n All they can do is tell us that when you put us together,\n\n17:26.240 --> 17:30.080\n space time is doomed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters,\n\n17:30.080 --> 17:31.600\n 10 to the minus 43 seconds.\n\n17:31.600 --> 17:34.000\n Beyond that, space time doesn't even make sense.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.080\n It just has no operational definition.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\n So, but it doesn't tell you what's beyond.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.560\n And so they're just looking for deep structures\n\n17:41.560 --> 17:43.680\n like guessing is really fun.\n\n17:43.680 --> 17:47.160\n So these really brilliant guys, generic brilliant men\n\n17:47.160 --> 17:49.760\n and women who are doing this work, physicists,\n\n17:49.760 --> 17:52.280\n are making guesses about these structures,\n\n17:52.280 --> 17:54.120\n informed guesses, because they're trying to ask,\n\n17:54.120 --> 17:56.560\n well, okay, what deeper structure could give us\n\n17:56.560 --> 17:58.360\n the stuff that we're seeing in space time,\n\n17:58.360 --> 17:59.960\n but without certain commitments\n\n17:59.960 --> 18:02.840\n that we have to make in space time, like locality.\n\n18:02.840 --> 18:04.680\n So they make these brilliant guesses.\n\n18:04.680 --> 18:06.640\n And of course, most of the time you're gonna be wrong,\n\n18:06.640 --> 18:09.560\n but once you get one or two that start to pay off\n\n18:09.560 --> 18:11.320\n and then you get some lucky breaks.\n\n18:11.320 --> 18:14.080\n So they got a lucky break back in 1986.\n\n18:15.520 --> 18:17.720\n Couple of mathematicians named Park and Taylor\n\n18:18.680 --> 18:22.640\n took the scattering amplitude for two gluons coming in\n\n18:22.640 --> 18:25.560\n at high energy and four gluons going out at low energy.\n\n18:25.560 --> 18:27.200\n So that kind of scattering thing.\n\n18:27.200 --> 18:30.280\n So it's like apparently for people who are into this,\n\n18:30.280 --> 18:32.040\n that's sort of something that happens so often\n\n18:32.040 --> 18:34.320\n you need to be able to find it and get rid of those\n\n18:34.320 --> 18:36.160\n cause you already know about that and you need to.\n\n18:36.160 --> 18:37.280\n So you needed to compute them.\n\n18:37.280 --> 18:39.880\n It was billions of terms and they couldn't do it\n\n18:39.880 --> 18:41.960\n even though for the supercomputers couldn't do that\n\n18:41.960 --> 18:44.560\n for the many billions or millions of times per second\n\n18:44.560 --> 18:45.400\n they needed to do it.\n\n18:45.400 --> 18:49.040\n So the experimentals begged the theorists,\n\n18:49.040 --> 18:51.280\n please, you got it.\n\n18:51.280 --> 18:53.160\n And so Park and Taylor took the billions of terms,\n\n18:53.160 --> 18:58.120\n hundreds of pages and miraculously turned it into nine.\n\n18:58.120 --> 18:59.360\n And then a little bit later,\n\n18:59.360 --> 19:01.240\n they guessed one term expression\n\n19:01.240 --> 19:02.480\n that turned out to be equivalent.\n\n19:02.480 --> 19:07.240\n So billions of terms reduced to one term,\n\n19:07.240 --> 19:10.720\n that so called famous Park Taylor formula, 1986.\n\n19:10.720 --> 19:14.240\n And that was like, okay, where did that come from?\n\n19:14.240 --> 19:18.840\n This is a pointer into a deep realm, beyond space and time,\n\n19:18.840 --> 19:21.480\n but no one, I mean, what can you do with it?\n\n19:21.480 --> 19:23.120\n And they thought maybe it was a one off,\n\n19:23.120 --> 19:25.840\n but then other formulas started coming up.\n\n19:25.840 --> 19:28.440\n And then eventually Neymar, Connie, Hamid and his team\n\n19:28.440 --> 19:30.200\n found this thing called the amplituhedron,\n\n19:30.200 --> 19:32.640\n which really sort of captures the whole,\n\n19:32.640 --> 19:34.600\n a big part of the whole ball of wax.\n\n19:34.600 --> 19:37.800\n I'm sure they would say, no, there's plenty more to do.\n\n19:37.800 --> 19:40.440\n So I won't say they did it all by any means.\n\n19:40.440 --> 19:42.640\n They're looking at the cosmological polytope as well.\n\n19:42.640 --> 19:47.640\n So what's remarkable to me is that two pillars\n\n19:48.040 --> 19:51.640\n of modern science, quantum field theory with gravity\n\n19:51.640 --> 19:54.240\n on the one hand and evolution by natural selection\n\n19:54.240 --> 19:56.840\n on the other, just in the last 20 years\n\n19:56.840 --> 20:01.080\n have very clearly said space time has had a good run.\n\n20:01.080 --> 20:03.800\n Reductionism has been a fantastic methodology.\n\n20:03.800 --> 20:05.680\n So we had a great ontology of space time,\n\n20:05.680 --> 20:07.920\n a great methodology of reductionism.\n\n20:07.920 --> 20:09.440\n Now it's time for a new trick.\n\n20:10.720 --> 20:13.000\n But now you need to go deeper and show,\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:14.920\n but by the way, this doesn't mean we throw away\n\n20:14.920 --> 20:17.160\n everything we've done, not by a long shot.\n\n20:17.160 --> 20:20.720\n Every new idea that we come up with beyond space time\n\n20:20.720 --> 20:23.280\n must project precisely into space time.\n\n20:23.280 --> 20:25.320\n And it better give us back everything that we know\n\n20:25.320 --> 20:28.680\n and love in space time or generalizations,\n\n20:28.680 --> 20:30.800\n or it's not gonna be taken seriously and it shouldn't be.\n\n20:30.800 --> 20:34.640\n So we have a strong constraint on whatever we're going to do\n\n20:34.640 --> 20:37.600\n beyond space time, it needs to project into space time.\n\n20:37.600 --> 20:39.360\n And whatever this deeper theory is,\n\n20:39.360 --> 20:42.800\n it may not itself have evolution by natural selection.\n\n20:42.800 --> 20:44.440\n This may not be part of this deeper realm.\n\n20:44.440 --> 20:47.480\n But when we take whatever that thing is beyond space time\n\n20:47.480 --> 20:49.160\n and project it into space time,\n\n20:49.160 --> 20:51.720\n it has to look like evolution by natural selection\n\n20:51.720 --> 20:52.920\n or it's wrong.\n\n20:52.920 --> 20:57.400\n So that's a strong constraint on this work.\n\n20:57.400 --> 21:00.880\n So even the evolution by natural selection\n\n21:00.880 --> 21:05.880\n and quantum field theory could be interfaces\n\n21:06.440 --> 21:11.440\n into something that doesn't look anything like,\n\n21:11.760 --> 21:12.600\n like you mentioned.\n\n21:12.600 --> 21:14.520\n I mean, it's interesting to think that evolution\n\n21:14.520 --> 21:16.880\n might be a very crappy interface\n\n21:16.880 --> 21:18.360\n into something much deeper.\n\n21:18.360 --> 21:19.200\n That's right.\n\n21:19.200 --> 21:21.880\n They're both telling us that the framework that you've had\n\n21:21.880 --> 21:24.160\n can only go so far and it has to stop.\n\n21:24.160 --> 21:25.600\n And there's something beyond.\n\n21:25.600 --> 21:29.160\n And the very framework that is space and time itself.\n\n21:29.160 --> 21:32.360\n Now, of course, evolution by natural selection\n\n21:32.360 --> 21:35.960\n is not telling us about like Einstein's relativistic\n\n21:35.960 --> 21:36.800\n space time.\n\n21:36.800 --> 21:38.280\n So that was another question you asked a little bit earlier.\n\n21:38.280 --> 21:42.360\n It's telling us more about our perceptual space and time,\n\n21:42.360 --> 21:46.160\n which we have used as the basis for creating\n\n21:46.160 --> 21:49.680\n first Newtonian space versus time\n\n21:49.680 --> 21:53.280\n as a mathematical extension of our perceptions.\n\n21:53.280 --> 21:56.680\n And then Einstein then took that and extended it even further.\n\n21:56.680 --> 21:59.120\n So the relationship between what evolution is telling us\n\n21:59.120 --> 22:01.040\n and what the physicists are telling us is that\n\n22:01.040 --> 22:05.880\n in some sense, the Newton and Einstein space time\n\n22:07.160 --> 22:11.320\n are formulated as sort of rigorous extensions\n\n22:11.320 --> 22:12.760\n of our perceptual space,\n\n22:14.040 --> 22:15.520\n making it mathematically rigorous\n\n22:15.520 --> 22:19.080\n and laying out the symmetries that they find there.\n\n22:19.080 --> 22:20.760\n So that's sort of the relationship between them.\n\n22:20.760 --> 22:22.440\n So it's the perceptual space time\n\n22:22.440 --> 22:24.040\n that evolution is telling us\n\n22:24.040 --> 22:27.760\n is just a user interface effectively.\n\n22:27.760 --> 22:28.960\n And then the physicists are finding\n\n22:28.960 --> 22:31.440\n that even the mathematical extension of that\n\n22:31.440 --> 22:36.160\n into the Einsteinian formulation has to be as well,\n\n22:36.160 --> 22:38.120\n not the final story, there's something deeper.\n\n22:38.120 --> 22:43.120\n So let me ask you about reductionism and interfaces\n\n22:43.200 --> 22:45.880\n as we march forward from Newtonian physics\n\n22:47.960 --> 22:49.920\n to quantum mechanics.\n\n22:49.920 --> 22:53.800\n These are all, in your view, interfaces.\n\n22:56.280 --> 22:59.240\n Are we getting closer to objective reality?\n\n22:59.240 --> 23:04.240\n How do we know if these interfaces in the process of science,\n\n23:04.840 --> 23:06.880\n the reason we like those interfaces\n\n23:06.880 --> 23:09.720\n is because they're predictive of some aspects,\n\n23:09.720 --> 23:13.160\n strongly predictive about some aspects of our reality.\n\n23:14.120 --> 23:16.040\n Is that completely deviating\n\n23:16.040 --> 23:19.560\n from our understanding of that reality\n\n23:19.560 --> 23:22.760\n or is it helping us get closer and closer and closer?\n\n23:22.760 --> 23:24.560\n Well, of course, one critical constraint\n\n23:24.560 --> 23:25.400\n on all of our theories\n\n23:25.400 --> 23:27.240\n is that they are empirically tested\n\n23:27.240 --> 23:30.800\n and pass the experiments that we have for them.\n\n23:30.800 --> 23:34.440\n So no one's arguing against experiments being important\n\n23:34.440 --> 23:38.440\n and wanting to test all of our current theories\n\n23:38.440 --> 23:40.600\n and any new theories on that.\n\n23:40.600 --> 23:44.280\n So that's all there.\n\n23:44.280 --> 23:48.040\n But we have good reason to believe\n\n23:48.040 --> 23:50.560\n that science will never get a theory of everything.\n\n23:51.520 --> 23:52.760\n Everything, everything.\n\n23:52.760 --> 23:53.720\n Everything, everything, right.\n\n23:53.720 --> 23:55.640\n A final theory of everything, right.\n\n23:55.640 --> 23:58.440\n I think that my own take is, for what it's worth,\n\n23:58.440 --> 24:00.920\n is that G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem\n\n24:00.920 --> 24:02.480\n sort of points us in that direction,\n\n24:02.480 --> 24:04.080\n that even with mathematics,\n\n24:05.240 --> 24:08.760\n any finite axiomatization that's sophisticated enough\n\n24:08.760 --> 24:10.360\n to be able to do arithmetic,\n\n24:10.360 --> 24:13.560\n it's easy to show that there'll be statements that are true,\n\n24:13.560 --> 24:16.280\n that can't be proven,\n\n24:16.280 --> 24:19.480\n can't be deduced from within that framework.\n\n24:19.480 --> 24:21.920\n And if you add the new statements to your axioms,\n\n24:21.920 --> 24:24.280\n then there'll be always new statements that are true,\n\n24:24.280 --> 24:26.920\n but can't be proven with a new axiom system.\n\n24:26.920 --> 24:31.920\n And the best scientific theories in physics, for example,\n\n24:32.640 --> 24:35.080\n and also now evolution, are mathematical.\n\n24:35.080 --> 24:36.320\n So our theories are gonna be,\n\n24:36.320 --> 24:38.400\n they're gonna have their own assumptions\n\n24:38.400 --> 24:41.720\n and they'll be mathematically precise.\n\n24:41.720 --> 24:42.800\n And there'll be theories, perhaps,\n\n24:42.800 --> 24:44.440\n of everything except those assumptions,\n\n24:44.440 --> 24:46.280\n because the assumptions are,\n\n24:46.280 --> 24:48.280\n we say, please grant me these assumptions.\n\n24:48.280 --> 24:49.440\n If you grant me these assumptions,\n\n24:49.440 --> 24:52.000\n then I can explain this other stuff.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:57.000\n So you have the assumptions that are like miracles,\n\n24:57.600 --> 24:58.640\n as far as the theory is concerned.\n\n24:58.640 --> 24:59.480\n They're not explained.\n\n24:59.480 --> 25:01.520\n They're the starting points for explanation.\n\n25:01.520 --> 25:03.160\n And then you have the mathematical structure\n\n25:03.160 --> 25:07.520\n of the theory itself, which will have the G\u00f6del limits.\n\n25:07.520 --> 25:12.520\n And so my take is that reality,\n\n25:12.520 --> 25:16.600\n reality, whatever it is, is always going to transcend\n\n25:18.240 --> 25:22.440\n any conceptual theory that we didn't come up with.\n\n25:22.440 --> 25:24.800\n There's always gonna be mystery at the edges.\n\n25:24.800 --> 25:27.640\n Right.\n\n25:27.640 --> 25:29.400\n Contradictions and all that kind of stuff.\n\n25:29.400 --> 25:30.240\n Okay.\n\n25:31.560 --> 25:32.880\n And truths.\n\n25:32.880 --> 25:34.840\n So there's this idea that is brought up\n\n25:34.840 --> 25:39.440\n in the financial space of settlement of transactions.\n\n25:39.440 --> 25:42.560\n It's often talked about in cryptocurrency, especially.\n\n25:42.560 --> 25:44.600\n So you could do, you know, money, cash,\n\n25:44.600 --> 25:48.640\n is not connected to anything.\n\n25:48.640 --> 25:52.200\n It used to be connected to gold, to physical reality,\n\n25:52.200 --> 25:54.640\n but then you can use money to exchange,\n\n25:54.640 --> 25:57.280\n to exchange value, to transact.\n\n25:57.280 --> 25:59.760\n So when it was on the gold standard,\n\n25:59.760 --> 26:04.760\n the money would represent some stable component of reality.\n\n26:04.760 --> 26:09.760\n Isn't it more effective to avoid things like hyperinflation\n\n26:12.280 --> 26:14.160\n if we generalize that idea?\n\n26:14.160 --> 26:19.120\n Isn't it better to connect your,\n\n26:19.120 --> 26:20.520\n whatever we humans are doing\n\n26:20.520 --> 26:23.040\n in the social interaction space with each other,\n\n26:23.040 --> 26:26.000\n isn't it better from an evolutionary perspective\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.040\n to connect it to some degree to reality\n\n26:28.040 --> 26:31.620\n so that the transactions are settled\n\n26:31.620 --> 26:33.740\n with something that's universal,\n\n26:33.740 --> 26:35.880\n as opposed to us constantly operating\n\n26:35.880 --> 26:38.080\n in something that's a complete illusion?\n\n26:38.080 --> 26:40.480\n Isn't it easy to hyperinflate that?\n\n26:41.400 --> 26:45.240\n Like where you really deviate very, very far away\n\n26:49.720 --> 26:51.000\n from the underlying reality,\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:53.720\n or do you not never get in trouble for this?\n\n26:53.720 --> 26:58.200\n Can you just completely drift far, far away\n\n26:58.200 --> 27:01.560\n from the underlying reality and never get in trouble?\n\n27:01.560 --> 27:04.440\n That's a great question, on the financial side,\n\n27:04.440 --> 27:05.560\n there's two levels at least\n\n27:05.560 --> 27:06.880\n that we could take your question.\n\n27:06.880 --> 27:09.800\n One is strictly like evolutionary psychology\n\n27:09.800 --> 27:13.480\n of financial systems, and that's pretty interesting.\n\n27:13.480 --> 27:15.100\n And there the decentralized idea,\n\n27:15.100 --> 27:18.520\n the DeFi kind of idea in cryptocurrencies\n\n27:18.520 --> 27:19.920\n may make good sense\n\n27:19.920 --> 27:22.400\n from just an evolutionary psychology point of view.\n\n27:22.400 --> 27:25.720\n Having human nature being what it is,\n\n27:25.720 --> 27:30.600\n putting a lot of faith in a few central controllers\n\n27:30.600 --> 27:34.280\n depends a lot on the veracity of those\n\n27:34.280 --> 27:37.080\n and trustworthiness of those few central controllers.\n\n27:37.080 --> 27:39.440\n And we have ample evidence time and again\n\n27:39.440 --> 27:41.880\n that that's often betrayed.\n\n27:41.880 --> 27:44.920\n So it makes good evolutionary sense, I would say,\n\n27:44.920 --> 27:46.680\n to have a decentralized,\n\n27:46.680 --> 27:49.600\n I mean, democracy is a step in that direction, right?\n\n27:49.600 --> 27:52.240\n We don't have a monarch now telling us what to do,\n\n27:52.240 --> 27:54.560\n we decentralize things, right?\n\n27:54.560 --> 27:55.880\n Because if the monarch,\n\n27:55.880 --> 27:58.600\n if you have Marcus Aurelius as your emperor, you're great.\n\n27:58.600 --> 28:01.160\n If you have Nero, it's not so great.\n\n28:01.160 --> 28:02.320\n And so we don't want that.\n\n28:02.320 --> 28:04.280\n So democracy is a step in that direction,\n\n28:04.280 --> 28:08.800\n but I think the DeFi thing is an even bigger step\n\n28:08.800 --> 28:13.120\n and is going to even make the democratization even greater.\n\n28:13.120 --> 28:14.840\n So that's one level of it.\n\n28:14.840 --> 28:16.480\n Also, the fact that power corrupts\n\n28:16.480 --> 28:18.120\n and absolute power corrupts absolutely\n\n28:18.120 --> 28:22.580\n is also a consequence of evolution.\n\n28:24.200 --> 28:26.960\n That's also a feature, I think, right?\n\n28:26.960 --> 28:30.880\n You can argue from the long span of living organisms,\n\n28:30.880 --> 28:33.840\n it's nice for power to corrupt for you to,\n\n28:33.840 --> 28:38.800\n so mad men and women throughout history\n\n28:38.800 --> 28:43.040\n might be useful to teach us a lesson about ourselves.\n\n28:43.040 --> 28:44.800\n We can learn from our negative example, right?\n\n28:44.800 --> 28:45.640\n Exactly.\n\n28:45.640 --> 28:48.040\n Right, right, right.\n\n28:48.040 --> 28:51.120\n Power does corrupt and I think that you can think about that\n\n28:51.120 --> 28:53.600\n again from an evolutionary point of view.\n\n28:53.600 --> 28:55.800\n But I think that your question was a little deeper\n\n28:55.800 --> 29:00.800\n when that was, does the evolutionary interface idea\n\n29:01.480 --> 29:06.480\n sort of unhinge science from some kind of important test\n\n29:07.920 --> 29:08.840\n for the theories, right?\n\n29:08.840 --> 29:12.320\n We don't want, it doesn't mean that anything goes\n\n29:12.320 --> 29:14.560\n in scientific theory, but there's no,\n\n29:14.560 --> 29:15.880\n if we don't see the truth,\n\n29:15.880 --> 29:18.640\n is there no way to tether our theories and test them?\n\n29:18.640 --> 29:23.640\n And I think there's no problem there.\n\n29:23.640 --> 29:27.800\n We can only test things in terms of what we can measure\n\n29:27.800 --> 29:29.520\n with our senses in space and time.\n\n29:29.520 --> 29:33.400\n So we're going to have to continue to do experiments\n\n29:33.400 --> 29:35.040\n and, but we're going to re,\n\n29:35.040 --> 29:36.840\n we're going to understand a little bit differently\n\n29:36.840 --> 29:38.440\n what those experiments are.\n\n29:38.440 --> 29:41.840\n We had thought that when we see a pointer\n\n29:41.840 --> 29:45.720\n on some machine in an experiment,\n\n29:45.720 --> 29:48.240\n that the machine exists, the pointer exists\n\n29:48.240 --> 29:51.280\n and the values exist even when no one is looking at them\n\n29:51.280 --> 29:52.760\n and that they're an objective truth.\n\n29:52.760 --> 29:55.480\n And our best theories are telling us no,\n\n29:55.480 --> 29:58.480\n the pointers are just pointers\n\n29:58.480 --> 30:00.120\n and that's what you have to rely on\n\n30:00.120 --> 30:02.880\n for making your judgments.\n\n30:02.880 --> 30:07.640\n But even the pointers themselves\n\n30:07.640 --> 30:10.480\n are not the objective reality.\n\n30:10.480 --> 30:13.600\n So, and I think G\u00f6del is telling us that,\n\n30:13.600 --> 30:17.760\n not that anything goes, but as you develop\n\n30:17.760 --> 30:19.760\n new axiom systems, you will find out what goes\n\n30:19.760 --> 30:21.640\n within that axiom system\n\n30:21.640 --> 30:23.720\n and what testable predictions you can make.\n\n30:23.720 --> 30:25.800\n So I don't think we're untethered.\n\n30:25.800 --> 30:28.000\n We continue to do experiments.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:31.160\n What I think we won't have that we want\n\n30:31.160 --> 30:34.040\n is a conceptual understanding\n\n30:34.040 --> 30:35.560\n that gives us a theory of everything\n\n30:35.560 --> 30:37.560\n that's final and complete.\n\n30:37.560 --> 30:40.280\n I think that this is, to put it another way,\n\n30:40.280 --> 30:43.080\n this is job security for scientists.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:45.240\n Our job will never be done.\n\n30:45.240 --> 30:47.760\n It's job security for neuroscience.\n\n30:47.760 --> 30:50.760\n Because before we thought that when we looked in the brain,\n\n30:50.760 --> 30:52.440\n we saw neurons and neural networks\n\n30:52.440 --> 30:57.440\n and action potentials and synapses and so forth.\n\n30:57.560 --> 31:00.320\n And that was it, that was the reality.\n\n31:00.320 --> 31:01.760\n Now we have to reverse engineer that.\n\n31:01.760 --> 31:04.760\n We have to say, what is beyond space time?\n\n31:04.760 --> 31:05.760\n What is going on?\n\n31:05.760 --> 31:08.400\n What is a dynamical system beyond space time?\n\n31:08.400 --> 31:10.520\n That when we project it into Einstein's space time,\n\n31:10.520 --> 31:12.360\n gives us things that look like neurons\n\n31:12.360 --> 31:14.160\n and neural networks and synapses.\n\n31:15.240 --> 31:16.520\n So we have to reverse engineer it.\n\n31:16.520 --> 31:19.000\n So there's gonna be lots more work for neuroscience.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:20.840\n It's gonna be far more complicated\n\n31:20.840 --> 31:23.840\n and difficult and challenging.\n\n31:23.840 --> 31:26.000\n But that's wonderful, that's what we need to do.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.400\n We thought neurons exist when they are perceived\n\n31:28.400 --> 31:29.320\n and they don't.\n\n31:29.320 --> 31:31.040\n In the same way that if I show you,\n\n31:31.040 --> 31:32.000\n when I say they don't exist,\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.440\n I should be very, very concrete.\n\n31:34.440 --> 31:36.240\n If I draw on a piece of paper,\n\n31:36.240 --> 31:40.480\n a little sketch of something that is called the Necker cube,\n\n31:40.480 --> 31:42.840\n it's just a little line drawing of a cube, right?\n\n31:42.840 --> 31:44.000\n It's not a flat piece of paper.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.160\n If I execute it well, and I show it to you,\n\n31:46.160 --> 31:48.360\n you'll see a 3D cube and you'll see it flip.\n\n31:48.360 --> 31:49.760\n Sometimes you'll see one face in front,\n\n31:49.760 --> 31:51.920\n sometimes you'll see the other face in front.\n\n31:51.920 --> 31:54.360\n But if I ask you, which face is in front\n\n31:54.360 --> 31:55.320\n when you don't look?\n\n31:57.200 --> 31:59.600\n The answer is, well, neither face is in front\n\n31:59.600 --> 32:01.320\n because there's no cube.\n\n32:01.320 --> 32:03.200\n There's just a flat piece of paper.\n\n32:03.200 --> 32:05.120\n So when you look at the piece of paper,\n\n32:05.120 --> 32:08.440\n you perceptually create the cube.\n\n32:08.440 --> 32:09.960\n And when you look at it,\n\n32:09.960 --> 32:13.120\n then you fix one face to be in front and one face to be.\n\n32:13.120 --> 32:16.000\n So that's what I mean when I say it doesn't exist.\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.120\n Space time itself is like the cube.\n\n32:18.120 --> 32:21.960\n It's a data structure that your sensory systems construct,\n\n32:21.960 --> 32:23.720\n whatever your sensory systems mean now,\n\n32:23.720 --> 32:27.320\n because we now have to not even take that for granted.\n\n32:27.320 --> 32:31.400\n But there are perceptions that you construct on the fly\n\n32:31.400 --> 32:34.000\n and they're data structures in a computer science sense,\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:35.680\n and you garbage collect them when you don't need them.\n\n32:35.680 --> 32:37.480\n So you create them and garbage collect them.\n\n32:37.480 --> 32:40.880\n But is it possible that it's mapped well\n\n32:40.880 --> 32:45.640\n in some concrete, predictable way to objective reality?\n\n32:45.640 --> 32:48.640\n The sheet of paper, this two dimensional space,\n\n32:48.640 --> 32:51.240\n or we can talk about space time,\n\n32:51.240 --> 32:55.840\n maps in some way that we maybe don't yet understand,\n\n32:55.840 --> 32:59.620\n but we'll one day understand what that mapping is,\n\n32:59.620 --> 33:00.920\n but it maps reliably.\n\n33:00.920 --> 33:02.940\n It is tethered in that way.\n\n33:02.940 --> 33:03.780\n Well, yes.\n\n33:03.780 --> 33:06.240\n And so the new theories that the physicists are finding\n\n33:06.240 --> 33:08.120\n beyond space time have that kind of tethering.\n\n33:08.120 --> 33:11.880\n So they show precisely how you start with an epileptic hedron\n\n33:11.880 --> 33:15.260\n and how you project this high dimensional structure\n\n33:15.260 --> 33:18.280\n into the four dimensions of space time.\n\n33:18.280 --> 33:22.320\n So there's a precise procedure that relates the two.\n\n33:22.320 --> 33:23.820\n And they're doing the same thing\n\n33:23.820 --> 33:25.120\n with the cosmological polytopes.\n\n33:25.120 --> 33:29.760\n So they're the ones that are making the most concrete\n\n33:29.760 --> 33:32.840\n and fun advances going beyond space time.\n\n33:32.840 --> 33:35.360\n And they're tethering it, right?\n\n33:35.360 --> 33:38.440\n They say this is precisely the mathematical projection\n\n33:38.440 --> 33:41.600\n from this deeper structure into space time.\n\n33:41.600 --> 33:44.640\n One thing I'll say about, as a non physicist,\n\n33:44.640 --> 33:48.840\n what I find interesting is that they're finding just geometry,\n\n33:48.840 --> 33:51.120\n but there's no notion of dynamics.\n\n33:51.120 --> 33:52.960\n Right now, they're just finding\n\n33:52.960 --> 33:57.400\n these static geometric structures, which is impressive.\n\n33:57.400 --> 33:58.400\n So I'm not putting them down.\n\n33:58.400 --> 34:01.160\n This is what they're doing is unbelievably complicated\n\n34:01.160 --> 34:06.160\n and brilliant and adventurous, it's all those things.\n\n34:08.280 --> 34:11.720\n And beautiful from a human aesthetic perspective\n\n34:11.720 --> 34:12.920\n because geometry is beautiful.\n\n34:12.920 --> 34:14.160\n It's absolutely.\n\n34:14.160 --> 34:16.400\n And they're finding symmetries that are true of the data\n\n34:16.400 --> 34:18.660\n that can't be seen in space time.\n\n34:18.660 --> 34:22.940\n But I'm looking for a theory beyond space time\n\n34:22.940 --> 34:24.440\n that's a dynamical theory.\n\n34:25.320 --> 34:27.520\n I would love to find, and we can talk about that\n\n34:27.520 --> 34:29.560\n at some point, a theory of consciousness\n\n34:29.560 --> 34:33.100\n in which the dynamics of consciousness itself\n\n34:33.100 --> 34:35.500\n will give rise to the geometry\n\n34:35.500 --> 34:37.960\n that the physicists are finding beyond space time.\n\n34:37.960 --> 34:38.800\n If we can do that,\n\n34:38.800 --> 34:40.440\n then we'd have a completely different way\n\n34:40.440 --> 34:42.620\n of looking at how consciousness is related\n\n34:42.620 --> 34:45.280\n to what we call the brain or the physical world\n\n34:45.280 --> 34:46.280\n more generally, right?\n\n34:46.280 --> 34:49.280\n Right now, all of my brilliant colleagues,\n\n34:49.280 --> 34:51.940\n well, 99% of them are trying to,\n\n34:53.880 --> 34:56.720\n they're assuming space time is fundamental.\n\n34:56.720 --> 34:59.160\n They're assuming that particles are fundamental,\n\n34:59.160 --> 35:02.000\n quarks, gluons, leptons, and so forth.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.040\n Elements, atoms, and so forth are fundamental\n\n35:04.040 --> 35:06.400\n and that therefore neurons and brains\n\n35:06.400 --> 35:08.800\n are part of objective reality.\n\n35:08.800 --> 35:10.880\n And that somehow when you get matter\n\n35:10.880 --> 35:12.640\n that's complicated enough,\n\n35:12.640 --> 35:16.240\n it will somehow generate conscious experiences\n\n35:16.240 --> 35:17.840\n by its functional properties.\n\n35:17.840 --> 35:20.520\n Or if you're panpsychist, maybe you,\n\n35:20.520 --> 35:22.680\n in addition to the physical properties of particles,\n\n35:22.680 --> 35:27.260\n you add your consciousness property as well.\n\n35:27.260 --> 35:30.880\n And then you combine these physical and conscious properties\n\n35:30.880 --> 35:32.220\n to get more complicated ones.\n\n35:32.220 --> 35:34.740\n But they're all doing it within space time.\n\n35:36.360 --> 35:38.960\n All of the work that's being done on consciousness\n\n35:38.960 --> 35:41.880\n and its relationship to the brain\n\n35:41.880 --> 35:45.000\n is all assumed something that our best theories\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:46.800\n are telling us is doomed, space time.\n\n35:46.800 --> 35:50.440\n Why does that particular assumption bother you the most?\n\n35:50.440 --> 35:52.100\n So you bring up space time.\n\n35:53.660 --> 35:56.960\n I mean, that's just one useful interface\n\n35:56.960 --> 35:58.720\n we've used for a long time.\n\n35:59.680 --> 36:01.720\n Surely there's other interfaces.\n\n36:01.720 --> 36:04.700\n Is space time just one of the big ones\n\n36:04.700 --> 36:06.800\n that you, to build up people's intuition\n\n36:06.800 --> 36:10.360\n about the fact that they do assume a lot of things strongly?\n\n36:10.360 --> 36:15.040\n Or is it in fact the fundamental flaw\n\n36:15.040 --> 36:16.560\n in the way we see the world?\n\n36:17.480 --> 36:19.780\n Well, everything else that we think we know\n\n36:20.640 --> 36:21.840\n are things in space time.\n\n36:23.380 --> 36:24.220\n Sure.\n\n36:24.220 --> 36:27.720\n And so when you say space time is doomed,\n\n36:27.720 --> 36:32.720\n this is a shot to the heart of the whole framework,\n\n36:32.880 --> 36:35.900\n the whole conceptual framework that we've had in science.\n\n36:35.900 --> 36:37.720\n Not to the scientific method,\n\n36:37.720 --> 36:40.800\n but to the fundamental ontology\n\n36:40.800 --> 36:42.400\n and also the fundamental methodology,\n\n36:42.400 --> 36:45.760\n the ontology of space time and its contents,\n\n36:45.760 --> 36:47.360\n and the methodology of reductionism,\n\n36:47.360 --> 36:51.940\n which is that as we go to smaller scales in space time,\n\n36:51.940 --> 36:55.160\n we will find more and more fundamental laws.\n\n36:55.160 --> 36:59.440\n And that's been very useful for space and time for centuries,\n\n36:59.440 --> 37:01.440\n reductionism for centuries.\n\n37:01.440 --> 37:04.680\n But now we realize that that's over.\n\n37:04.680 --> 37:08.720\n Reductionism is in fact dead, as is space time.\n\n37:08.720 --> 37:10.600\n What exactly is reductionism?\n\n37:10.600 --> 37:13.120\n What is the process of reductionism\n\n37:13.120 --> 37:17.640\n that is different than some of the physicists\n\n37:17.640 --> 37:19.440\n that you mentioned that are trying to think,\n\n37:19.440 --> 37:22.080\n trying to let go of the assumption of space time?\n\n37:22.080 --> 37:24.560\n Looking beyond, isn't that still trying to come up\n\n37:24.560 --> 37:27.360\n with a simple model that explains this whole thing?\n\n37:27.360 --> 37:29.400\n Isn't it still reducing?\n\n37:29.400 --> 37:30.240\n It's a wonderful question,\n\n37:30.240 --> 37:33.120\n because it really helps to clarify two different notions,\n\n37:33.120 --> 37:35.560\n which is scientific explanation on the one hand,\n\n37:36.520 --> 37:39.840\n and a particular kind of scientific explanation on the other,\n\n37:39.840 --> 37:40.860\n which is the reductionist.\n\n37:40.860 --> 37:43.240\n So the reductionist explanation is saying,\n\n37:43.240 --> 37:47.520\n I will start with things that are smaller in space time\n\n37:47.520 --> 37:49.320\n and therefore more fundamental,\n\n37:49.320 --> 37:51.080\n where the laws are more fundamental.\n\n37:51.080 --> 37:54.880\n So we go to just smaller and smaller scales.\n\n37:54.880 --> 37:58.000\n Whereas in science more generally,\n\n37:58.000 --> 37:59.520\n we just say like when Einstein\n\n37:59.520 --> 38:01.480\n did the special theory of relativity,\n\n38:01.480 --> 38:03.600\n he's saying, let me have a couple of postulates.\n\n38:03.600 --> 38:06.160\n I will assume that the speed of light is universal\n\n38:06.160 --> 38:11.160\n for all observers in uniform motion,\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:13.360\n and that the laws of physics,\n\n38:13.360 --> 38:16.780\n so if you're for uniform motion are,\n\n38:16.780 --> 38:18.080\n that's not a reductionist.\n\n38:18.080 --> 38:20.020\n Those are saying, grant me these assumptions.\n\n38:20.020 --> 38:23.400\n I can build this entire concept of space time out of it.\n\n38:23.400 --> 38:24.560\n It's not a reductionist thing.\n\n38:24.560 --> 38:27.780\n You're not going to smaller and smaller scales of space.\n\n38:27.780 --> 38:30.600\n You're coming up with these deep, deep principles.\n\n38:30.600 --> 38:33.080\n Same thing with his theory of gravity, right?\n\n38:33.080 --> 38:35.600\n It's the falling elevator idea, right?\n\n38:35.600 --> 38:37.760\n So this is not a reductionist kind of thing.\n\n38:37.760 --> 38:39.800\n It's something different.\n\n38:39.800 --> 38:44.800\n So simplification is a bigger thing than just reductionism.\n\n38:45.520 --> 38:47.720\n Reductionism has been a particularly useful\n\n38:47.720 --> 38:49.520\n kind of scientific explanation,\n\n38:49.520 --> 38:51.720\n for example, in thermodynamics, right?\n\n38:51.720 --> 38:53.360\n Where the notion that we have of heat,\n\n38:53.360 --> 38:56.640\n some macroscopic thing like temperature and heat,\n\n38:56.640 --> 38:59.600\n it turns out that Neil Boltzmann and others discovered,\n\n38:59.600 --> 39:02.000\n well, hey, if we go to smaller and smaller scales,\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:04.480\n we find these things called molecules or atoms.\n\n39:04.480 --> 39:06.440\n And if we think of them as bouncing around\n\n39:06.440 --> 39:08.680\n and having some kind of energy,\n\n39:08.680 --> 39:13.680\n then what we call heat really can be reduced to that.\n\n39:14.720 --> 39:19.100\n And so that's a particularly useful kind of reduction,\n\n39:19.100 --> 39:21.400\n is a useful kind of scientific explanation\n\n39:21.400 --> 39:25.480\n that works within a range of scales within space time.\n\n39:25.480 --> 39:28.480\n But we know now precisely where that has to stop.\n\n39:28.480 --> 39:30.240\n At 10 to the minus 33 centimeters\n\n39:30.240 --> 39:32.720\n and 10 to the minus 43 seconds.\n\n39:32.720 --> 39:34.360\n And I would be impressed\n\n39:34.360 --> 39:37.520\n if it was 10 to the minus 33 trillion centimeters.\n\n39:37.520 --> 39:40.440\n I'm not terribly impressed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.\n\n39:43.560 --> 39:44.880\n I don't even know how to comprehend\n\n39:44.880 --> 39:47.360\n either of those numbers, frankly.\n\n39:47.360 --> 39:49.080\n Just a small aside,\n\n39:49.080 --> 39:51.520\n because I am a computer science person,\n\n39:51.520 --> 39:54.120\n I also find cellular automata beautiful.\n\n39:54.120 --> 39:57.840\n And so you have somebody like Stephen Wolfram,\n\n39:57.840 --> 40:01.560\n who recently has been very excitedly exploring\n\n40:02.360 --> 40:04.320\n a proposal for a data structure\n\n40:04.320 --> 40:07.600\n that could be the numbers that would make you\n\n40:07.600 --> 40:09.240\n a little bit happier in terms of scale,\n\n40:09.240 --> 40:11.720\n because they're very, very, very, very tiny.\n\n40:12.680 --> 40:15.480\n So do you like this space of exploration\n\n40:15.480 --> 40:18.600\n of really thinking, letting go of space time,\n\n40:18.600 --> 40:20.280\n letting go of everything and trying to think\n\n40:20.280 --> 40:21.660\n what kind of data structures\n\n40:21.660 --> 40:23.780\n could be underneath this whole mess?\n\n40:23.780 --> 40:24.620\n That's right.\n\n40:24.620 --> 40:27.800\n So if they're thinking about these as outside of space time,\n\n40:27.800 --> 40:29.120\n then that's what we have to do.\n\n40:29.120 --> 40:30.560\n That's what our best theories are telling us.\n\n40:30.560 --> 40:32.600\n You now have to think outside of space time.\n\n40:32.600 --> 40:36.520\n Now, of course, I should back up and say,\n\n40:36.520 --> 40:40.360\n we know that Einstein surpassed Newton, right?\n\n40:40.360 --> 40:41.960\n But that doesn't mean that there's not good work\n\n40:41.960 --> 40:42.940\n to do on Newton.\n\n40:42.940 --> 40:44.300\n There's all sorts of Newtonian physics\n\n40:44.300 --> 40:46.220\n that takes us to the moon and so forth,\n\n40:46.220 --> 40:47.240\n and there's lots of good problems\n\n40:47.240 --> 40:49.960\n that we want to solve with Newtonian physics.\n\n40:49.960 --> 40:52.200\n The same thing will be true of space time.\n\n40:52.200 --> 40:53.960\n It's not like we're gonna stop using space time.\n\n40:53.960 --> 40:56.420\n We'll continue to do all sorts of good work there.\n\n40:56.420 --> 40:59.720\n But for those scientists who are really looking\n\n40:59.720 --> 41:04.240\n to go deeper, to actually find the next,\n\n41:04.240 --> 41:06.160\n just like what Einstein did to Newton,\n\n41:06.160 --> 41:07.440\n what are we gonna do to Einstein?\n\n41:07.440 --> 41:09.800\n How do we get beyond Einstein and quantum theory\n\n41:09.800 --> 41:10.900\n to something deeper?\n\n41:10.900 --> 41:13.280\n Then we have to actually let go.\n\n41:13.280 --> 41:17.800\n And if we're gonna do like this automata kind of approach,\n\n41:18.800 --> 41:21.180\n it's critical that it's not automata in space time,\n\n41:21.180 --> 41:23.580\n it's automata prior to space time,\n\n41:23.580 --> 41:25.880\n from which we're going to show how space time emerges.\n\n41:25.880 --> 41:28.240\n If you're doing automata within space time,\n\n41:28.240 --> 41:29.640\n well, that might be a fun model,\n\n41:29.640 --> 41:32.140\n but it's not the radical new step that we need.\n\n41:33.520 --> 41:36.760\n Yeah, so the space time emerges from that whatever system.\n\n41:36.760 --> 41:39.600\n Like you're saying, it's a dynamical system.\n\n41:39.600 --> 41:42.520\n Do we even have an understanding what dynamical means\n\n41:42.520 --> 41:43.760\n when we go beyond?\n\n41:45.480 --> 41:48.080\n When you start to think about dynamics,\n\n41:48.080 --> 41:50.360\n it could mean a lot of things.\n\n41:50.360 --> 41:53.000\n Even causality could mean a lot of things\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:56.760\n if we realize that everything's an interface.\n\n41:58.320 --> 42:01.400\n Like how much do we really know is an interesting question.\n\n42:01.400 --> 42:02.520\n Because you brought up neurons,\n\n42:02.520 --> 42:05.440\n I gotta ask you yet another tangent.\n\n42:05.440 --> 42:07.900\n There's a paper I remember a while ago looking at\n\n42:07.900 --> 42:11.480\n called Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor?\n\n42:11.480 --> 42:14.160\n And I just enjoyed that thought experiment\n\n42:14.160 --> 42:16.740\n that they provided, which is they basically,\n\n42:16.740 --> 42:18.880\n it's a couple of neuroscientists,\n\n42:18.880 --> 42:22.320\n Eric Jonas and Conrad Cording,\n\n42:22.320 --> 42:24.840\n who use the tools of neuroscience\n\n42:24.840 --> 42:29.840\n to analyze a microprocessor, so a computer chip.\n\n42:30.400 --> 42:32.200\n Now, if we lesion it here, what happens and so forth,\n\n42:32.200 --> 42:34.540\n and if you go and lesion in a computer,\n\n42:35.400 --> 42:38.280\n it's very, very clear that lesion experiments on computers\n\n42:38.280 --> 42:40.440\n are not gonna give you a lot of insight into how it works.\n\n42:40.440 --> 42:42.660\n And also the measurement devices and the kind of sort of,\n\n42:42.660 --> 42:44.560\n just using the basic approaches of neuroscience,\n\n42:44.560 --> 42:47.160\n collecting the data, trying to intuit\n\n42:47.160 --> 42:49.420\n about the underlying function of it.\n\n42:49.420 --> 42:52.540\n And that helps you understand that\n\n42:52.540 --> 42:55.900\n our scientific exploration of concepts,\n\n42:57.720 --> 42:59.340\n depending on the field,\n\n43:00.280 --> 43:05.000\n are maybe in the very, very early stages.\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:08.480\n I wouldn't say it leaves us astray,\n\n43:08.480 --> 43:09.560\n perhaps it does sometimes,\n\n43:09.560 --> 43:14.560\n but it's not anywhere close to some fundamental mechanism\n\n43:14.680 --> 43:16.440\n that actually makes a thing work.\n\n43:16.440 --> 43:18.960\n I don't know if you can sort of comment on that\n\n43:18.960 --> 43:20.440\n in terms of using neuroscience\n\n43:20.440 --> 43:24.200\n to understand the human mind and neurons.\n\n43:24.200 --> 43:26.320\n Are we really far away potentially\n\n43:26.320 --> 43:29.560\n from understanding in the way we understand\n\n43:30.480 --> 43:33.720\n the transistors enough to be able to build a computer?\n\n43:33.720 --> 43:37.960\n So one thing about understanding\n\n43:37.960 --> 43:39.580\n is you can understand for fun.\n\n43:40.600 --> 43:45.600\n The other one is to understand so you could build things.\n\n43:45.600 --> 43:49.120\n And that's when you really have to understand.\n\n43:49.120 --> 43:49.960\n Exactly.\n\n43:49.960 --> 43:53.880\n In fact, what got me into the field at MIT\n\n43:53.880 --> 43:57.620\n was work by David Marr on this very topic.\n\n43:57.620 --> 43:59.820\n So David Marr was a professor at MIT,\n\n43:59.820 --> 44:02.040\n but he'd done his PhD in neuroscience,\n\n44:02.040 --> 44:05.340\n studying just the architectures of the brain.\n\n44:05.340 --> 44:08.660\n But he realized that his work, it was on the cerebellum.\n\n44:10.040 --> 44:15.040\n He realized that his work, as rigorous as it was,\n\n44:15.040 --> 44:16.600\n left him unsatisfied\n\n44:16.600 --> 44:19.440\n because he didn't know what the cerebellum was for\n\n44:19.440 --> 44:21.680\n and why it had that architecture.\n\n44:21.680 --> 44:25.480\n And so he went to MIT and he was in the AI lab there.\n\n44:25.480 --> 44:29.600\n And he said, he had this three level approach\n\n44:29.600 --> 44:30.680\n that really grabbed my attention.\n\n44:30.680 --> 44:32.640\n So when I was an undergrad at UCLA,\n\n44:32.640 --> 44:34.760\n I read one of his papers in a class and said,\n\n44:34.760 --> 44:35.600\n who is this guy?\n\n44:35.600 --> 44:37.440\n Because he said, you have to have a computational theory.\n\n44:37.440 --> 44:39.040\n What is being computed and why?\n\n44:40.320 --> 44:42.360\n An algorithm, how is it being computed?\n\n44:42.360 --> 44:44.720\n What are the precise algorithms?\n\n44:44.720 --> 44:45.920\n And then the hardware,\n\n44:45.920 --> 44:47.800\n how does it get instantiated in the hardware?\n\n44:47.800 --> 44:50.400\n And so to really do neuroscience, he argued,\n\n44:50.400 --> 44:52.760\n we needed to have understanding at all those levels.\n\n44:52.760 --> 44:54.400\n And that really got me.\n\n44:54.400 --> 44:57.080\n I loved the neuroscience, but I realized this guy was saying,\n\n44:57.080 --> 45:00.080\n if you can't build it, you don't understand it effectively.\n\n45:00.080 --> 45:02.000\n And so that's why I went to MIT.\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.480\n And I had the pleasure of working with David\n\n45:04.480 --> 45:07.740\n until he died just a year and a half later.\n\n45:09.180 --> 45:12.760\n So there's been that idea that with neuroscience,\n\n45:12.760 --> 45:15.880\n we have to have, in some sense, a top down model\n\n45:15.880 --> 45:18.940\n of what's being computed and why\n\n45:18.940 --> 45:20.000\n that we would then go after.\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:21.480\n And the same thing with the, you know,\n\n45:21.480 --> 45:24.240\n trying to reverse engineer a computing system\n\n45:24.240 --> 45:25.520\n like your laptop.\n\n45:25.520 --> 45:27.640\n We really need to understand\n\n45:27.640 --> 45:29.120\n what the user interface is about\n\n45:29.120 --> 45:34.120\n and what are keys on the keyboard for and so forth.\n\n45:34.240 --> 45:37.440\n You need to know why to really understand\n\n45:37.440 --> 45:40.320\n all the circuitry and what it's for.\n\n45:40.320 --> 45:45.320\n Now, we don't, evolution of a natural selection\n\n45:46.560 --> 45:51.560\n does not tell us the deeper question that we're asking,\n\n45:51.760 --> 45:53.680\n the answer to the deeper question, which is why?\n\n45:53.680 --> 45:58.680\n What's this deeper reality and what's it up to and why?\n\n45:59.600 --> 46:03.180\n All it tells us is that whatever reality is,\n\n46:04.120 --> 46:05.500\n it's not what you see.\n\n46:05.500 --> 46:10.500\n What you see is just an adaptive fiction.\n\n46:12.180 --> 46:15.420\n So just to linger on this fascinating, bold question\n\n46:15.420 --> 46:18.980\n that shakes you out of your dream state.\n\n46:18.980 --> 46:23.420\n Does this fiction still help you in building intuitions\n\n46:23.420 --> 46:27.780\n as literary fiction does about reality?\n\n46:27.780 --> 46:30.260\n The reason we read literary fiction\n\n46:30.260 --> 46:35.260\n is it helps us build intuitions and understanding\n\n46:36.260 --> 46:39.140\n in indirect ways sneak up to the difficult questions\n\n46:39.140 --> 46:41.900\n of human nature, great fiction.\n\n46:41.900 --> 46:44.460\n Same with this observed reality.\n\n46:46.100 --> 46:49.180\n Does this interface that we get, this fictional interface,\n\n46:49.180 --> 46:52.820\n help us build intuition about deeper truths\n\n46:52.820 --> 46:55.020\n of how this whole mess works?\n\n46:55.020 --> 46:58.900\n Well, I think that each theory that we propose\n\n46:58.900 --> 47:01.100\n will give its own answer to that question, right?\n\n47:01.100 --> 47:05.300\n So when the physicists are proposing these structures\n\n47:05.300 --> 47:08.260\n like the amplituhedron and cosmological polytope,\n\n47:08.260 --> 47:11.100\n associahedron and so forth beyond space time,\n\n47:11.100 --> 47:14.200\n we can then ask your question for those specific structures\n\n47:14.200 --> 47:17.620\n and say, how much information, for example,\n\n47:17.620 --> 47:19.240\n does evolution by natural selection\n\n47:19.240 --> 47:24.240\n and the kinds of sensory systems that we have right now\n\n47:24.540 --> 47:26.940\n give us about this deeper reality?\n\n47:26.940 --> 47:30.020\n And why did we evolve this way?\n\n47:30.020 --> 47:33.020\n We can try to answer that question from within the deep.\n\n47:33.020 --> 47:34.940\n So there's not gonna be a general answer.\n\n47:34.940 --> 47:37.980\n I think what we'll have to do is posit\n\n47:37.980 --> 47:39.300\n these new deeper theories\n\n47:39.300 --> 47:41.480\n and then try to answer your question\n\n47:41.480 --> 47:43.580\n within the framework of those deeper theories,\n\n47:43.580 --> 47:47.140\n knowing full well that there'll be an even deeper theory.\n\n47:47.140 --> 47:49.860\n So is this paralyzing though?\n\n47:49.860 --> 47:53.380\n Because how do we know we're not completely adrift\n\n47:53.380 --> 47:57.700\n out to sea, lost forever from,\n\n47:57.700 --> 48:00.080\n so like that our theories are completely lost.\n\n48:00.080 --> 48:01.980\n So if it's all,\n\n48:04.240 --> 48:07.940\n if we can never truly deeply introspect to the bottom,\n\n48:09.220 --> 48:12.060\n if it's always just turtles on top of turtles infinitely,\n\n48:14.380 --> 48:18.360\n isn't that paralyzing for the scientific mind?\n\n48:18.360 --> 48:20.780\n Well, it's interesting that you say introspect\n\n48:20.780 --> 48:21.620\n to the bottom.\n\n48:21.620 --> 48:26.620\n Because there is one,\n\n48:26.940 --> 48:28.900\n again, this isn't the same spirit of what I said before,\n\n48:28.900 --> 48:31.000\n which is it depends on what answer you give\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:32.800\n to what's beyond space time,\n\n48:32.800 --> 48:35.180\n what answer we would give to your question, right?\n\n48:35.180 --> 48:39.660\n So, but one answer that is interesting to explore\n\n48:39.660 --> 48:41.260\n is something that spiritual traditions have said\n\n48:41.260 --> 48:43.640\n for thousands of years, but haven't said precisely.\n\n48:43.640 --> 48:45.860\n So we can't take it seriously in science\n\n48:45.860 --> 48:46.900\n until it's made precise,\n\n48:46.900 --> 48:49.120\n but we might be able to make it precise.\n\n48:49.120 --> 48:53.140\n And that is that they've also said something like\n\n48:53.140 --> 48:54.780\n space and time aren't fundamental,\n\n48:54.780 --> 48:56.820\n they're Maya, they're illusion.\n\n48:56.820 --> 49:01.340\n And, but that if you look inside, if you introspect\n\n49:03.240 --> 49:05.900\n and let go of all of your particular perceptions,\n\n49:07.260 --> 49:10.340\n you will come to something that's beyond conceptual thought.\n\n49:11.260 --> 49:15.340\n And that is, they claim,\n\n49:15.340 --> 49:17.580\n being in contact with the deep ground of being\n\n49:17.580 --> 49:21.220\n that transcends any particular conceptual understanding.\n\n49:21.220 --> 49:24.340\n If that is correct, and I'm not saying it's correct,\n\n49:24.340 --> 49:26.020\n but, and I'm not saying it's not correct,\n\n49:26.020 --> 49:28.340\n I'm just saying, if that's correct,\n\n49:28.340 --> 49:30.740\n then it would be the case that as scientists,\n\n49:30.740 --> 49:34.100\n because we also are in touch with this ground of being,\n\n49:34.100 --> 49:36.980\n we would then not be able\n\n49:36.980 --> 49:40.140\n to conceptually understand ourselves all the way,\n\n49:40.140 --> 49:43.540\n but we could know ourselves just by being ourselves.\n\n49:43.540 --> 49:46.100\n And so we would, there would be a sense\n\n49:46.100 --> 49:48.900\n in which there is a fundamental grounding\n\n49:48.900 --> 49:50.840\n to the whole enterprise,\n\n49:50.840 --> 49:53.320\n because we're not separate from the enterprise.\n\n49:53.320 --> 49:57.380\n This is the opposite of the impersonal third person science.\n\n49:57.380 --> 50:01.620\n This would make science go personal all the way down.\n\n50:01.620 --> 50:04.020\n And, but nevertheless, scientific,\n\n50:04.020 --> 50:07.020\n because the scientific method would still be\n\n50:07.020 --> 50:09.320\n what we would use all the way down\n\n50:09.320 --> 50:10.420\n for the conceptual understanding.\n\n50:10.420 --> 50:11.460\n Unfortunately, I still don't know\n\n50:11.460 --> 50:12.780\n if you went all the way down.\n\n50:12.780 --> 50:15.940\n It's possible that this kind of whatever consciousness is\n\n50:15.940 --> 50:17.300\n and we'll talk about it,\n\n50:17.300 --> 50:22.300\n is getting the cliche statement of be yourself.\n\n50:24.860 --> 50:28.520\n It is somehow digging at a deeper truth of reality,\n\n50:28.520 --> 50:31.940\n but you still don't know when you get to the bottom.\n\n50:31.940 --> 50:34.500\n A lot of people, they'll take psychedelic drugs\n\n50:34.500 --> 50:37.980\n and they'll say, well, that takes my mind to certain places\n\n50:37.980 --> 50:41.140\n where it feels like that is revealing\n\n50:41.140 --> 50:43.120\n some deeper truth of reality,\n\n50:43.120 --> 50:46.860\n but you still, it could be interfaces on top of interfaces.\n\n50:46.860 --> 50:51.860\n That's, in your view of this, you really don't know.\n\n50:52.620 --> 50:54.100\n I mean, it's Gato's incompleteness\n\n50:54.100 --> 50:55.620\n is that you really don't know.\n\n50:55.620 --> 50:58.480\n My own view on it, for what it's worth,\n\n50:59.740 --> 51:00.700\n because I don't know the right answer,\n\n51:00.700 --> 51:05.700\n but my own view on it right now is that it's never ending.\n\n51:05.780 --> 51:07.220\n I think that there will never,\n\n51:07.220 --> 51:09.020\n that this is great, as I said before,\n\n51:09.020 --> 51:12.020\n great job security for science.\n\n51:12.020 --> 51:14.860\n And that we, if this is true,\n\n51:14.860 --> 51:17.580\n and if consciousness is somehow important\n\n51:17.580 --> 51:19.020\n or fundamental in the universe,\n\n51:19.020 --> 51:20.620\n this may be an important fundamental fact\n\n51:20.620 --> 51:21.980\n about consciousness itself,\n\n51:21.980 --> 51:25.080\n that it's a never ending exploration\n\n51:25.080 --> 51:27.520\n that's going on in some sense.\n\n51:27.520 --> 51:30.100\n Well, that's interesting.\n\n51:30.100 --> 51:31.900\n Push back on the job security.\n\n51:31.900 --> 51:32.740\n Okay.\n\n51:34.440 --> 51:37.500\n So maybe as we understand this kind of idea\n\n51:37.500 --> 51:39.140\n deeper and deeper,\n\n51:39.140 --> 51:42.940\n we understand that the pursuit is not a fruitful one.\n\n51:42.940 --> 51:45.180\n Then maybe we need to,\n\n51:45.180 --> 51:48.380\n maybe that's why we don't see aliens everywhere,\n\n51:48.380 --> 51:51.260\n is you get smarter and smarter and smarter,\n\n51:51.260 --> 51:55.580\n you realize that exploration is,\n\n51:55.580 --> 51:59.260\n there's other fun ways to spend your time than exploring.\n\n51:59.260 --> 52:03.960\n You could be sort of living maximally\n\n52:03.960 --> 52:05.860\n in some way that's not exploration.\n\n52:05.860 --> 52:10.020\n There's all kinds of video games you can construct\n\n52:10.020 --> 52:11.820\n and put yourself inside of them\n\n52:11.820 --> 52:15.220\n that don't involve you going outside of the game world.\n\n52:15.220 --> 52:18.740\n It's a feeling, from my human perspective,\n\n52:18.740 --> 52:21.020\n what seems to be fun is challenging yourself\n\n52:21.020 --> 52:22.660\n and overcoming those challenges.\n\n52:22.660 --> 52:25.220\n So you can constantly artificially generate challenges\n\n52:25.220 --> 52:28.260\n for yourself, like Sisyphus and his boulder,\n\n52:28.260 --> 52:30.660\n just, and that's it.\n\n52:30.660 --> 52:32.300\n So the scientific method\n\n52:32.300 --> 52:34.060\n that's always reaching out to the stars,\n\n52:34.060 --> 52:35.200\n that's always trying to figure out\n\n52:35.200 --> 52:37.380\n the puzzle on the bottom puzzle,\n\n52:37.380 --> 52:40.540\n we're always trying to get to the bottom turtle.\n\n52:40.540 --> 52:43.980\n Maybe if we can build more and more the intuition\n\n52:43.980 --> 52:46.180\n that that's infinite pursuit,\n\n52:48.880 --> 52:51.100\n we agree to start deviating from that pursuit\n\n52:51.100 --> 52:53.180\n and start enjoying the here and now\n\n52:53.180 --> 52:56.580\n versus the looking out into the unknown always.\n\n52:56.580 --> 52:58.960\n Maybe that's looking out into the unknown\n\n52:58.960 --> 53:03.960\n as a early activity for a species that's evolved.\n\n53:07.580 --> 53:09.820\n I'm just sort of saying, pushing back,\n\n53:09.820 --> 53:12.180\n as you probably got a lot of scientists excited\n\n53:12.180 --> 53:13.620\n in terms of job security,\n\n53:13.620 --> 53:17.780\n I could envision where it's not job security,\n\n53:17.780 --> 53:20.780\n where scientists become more and more useless.\n\n53:22.020 --> 53:25.500\n Maybe they're like the holders of the ancient wisdom\n\n53:25.500 --> 53:29.660\n that allows us to study our own history,\n\n53:29.660 --> 53:34.500\n but not much more than that, just to push back.\n\n53:34.500 --> 53:35.540\n That's good pushback.\n\n53:36.500 --> 53:39.340\n I'll put one in there for the scientists again,\n\n53:39.340 --> 53:41.460\n but sure, but then I'll take the other side too.\n\n53:41.460 --> 53:46.460\n So when Faraday did all of his experiments\n\n53:46.700 --> 53:49.340\n with magnets and electricity and so forth,\n\n53:49.340 --> 53:52.060\n he came up with all this wonderful empirical data\n\n53:52.060 --> 53:54.140\n and James Clerk Maxwell looked at it\n\n53:54.140 --> 53:56.140\n and wrote down a few equations,\n\n53:56.140 --> 53:58.220\n which we can now write down in a single equation,\n\n53:58.220 --> 54:00.180\n the Maxwell equation if we use geometric algebra,\n\n54:00.180 --> 54:01.140\n just one equation.\n\n54:03.900 --> 54:07.420\n That opened up unbelievable technologies.\n\n54:07.420 --> 54:09.500\n People are zooming and talking to each other\n\n54:09.500 --> 54:13.660\n around the world, the whole electronics industry.\n\n54:13.660 --> 54:17.140\n There was something that transformed our lives\n\n54:17.140 --> 54:18.460\n in a very positive way.\n\n54:19.380 --> 54:21.800\n With the theories beyond space time,\n\n54:21.800 --> 54:25.440\n here's one potential, right now,\n\n54:25.440 --> 54:29.440\n most of the galaxies that we see, we can see them,\n\n54:29.440 --> 54:31.040\n but we know that we could never get to them\n\n54:31.040 --> 54:32.640\n no matter how fast we traveled.\n\n54:32.640 --> 54:36.040\n They're going away from us at the speed of light or beyond.\n\n54:36.040 --> 54:37.720\n So we can't ever get to them.\n\n54:37.720 --> 54:39.160\n So there's all this beautiful real estate\n\n54:39.160 --> 54:41.080\n that's just smiling and waving at us\n\n54:41.080 --> 54:42.560\n and we can never get to it.\n\n54:42.560 --> 54:43.400\n Yeah.\n\n54:43.400 --> 54:45.560\n But that's if we go through space time.\n\n54:45.560 --> 54:47.240\n But if we recognize that space time\n\n54:47.240 --> 54:50.240\n is just a data structure, it's not fundamental.\n\n54:50.240 --> 54:53.920\n We're not little things inside space time.\n\n54:53.920 --> 54:58.120\n Space time was a little data structure in our perceptions.\n\n54:58.120 --> 54:59.960\n It's just the other way around.\n\n54:59.960 --> 55:01.240\n Once we understand that,\n\n55:02.200 --> 55:05.200\n and we get equations for the stuff that's beyond space time,\n\n55:07.080 --> 55:08.320\n maybe we won't have to go through space time.\n\n55:08.320 --> 55:09.640\n Maybe we can go around it.\n\n55:09.640 --> 55:11.080\n Maybe I can go to Proxima Centauri\n\n55:11.080 --> 55:11.920\n and not go through space.\n\n55:11.920 --> 55:14.680\n I can just go right there directly.\n\n55:14.680 --> 55:15.520\n It's a data structure.\n\n55:15.520 --> 55:17.200\n We can start to play with it.\n\n55:17.200 --> 55:21.680\n So I think that for what it's worth,\n\n55:21.680 --> 55:26.680\n my take would be that the endless sequence of theories\n\n55:27.760 --> 55:30.760\n that we could contemplate building\n\n55:30.760 --> 55:35.760\n will lead to an endless sequence of new remarkable insights\n\n55:36.600 --> 55:39.400\n into the potentialities, the possibilities\n\n55:39.400 --> 55:41.920\n that would seem miraculous to us.\n\n55:41.920 --> 55:45.200\n And that we will be motivated to continue the exploration\n\n55:45.200 --> 55:49.040\n partly just for the technological innovations\n\n55:49.040 --> 55:50.440\n that come out.\n\n55:50.440 --> 55:53.960\n But the other thing that you mentioned though,\n\n55:53.960 --> 55:55.560\n what about just being?\n\n55:55.560 --> 55:58.960\n What if we decide instead of all this doing and exploring,\n\n55:58.960 --> 56:00.120\n what about being?\n\n56:00.120 --> 56:04.400\n My guess is that the best scientists will do both\n\n56:04.400 --> 56:09.400\n and that the act of being will be a place\n\n56:10.200 --> 56:12.640\n where they get many of their ideas\n\n56:12.640 --> 56:16.560\n and that they then pull into the conceptual realm.\n\n56:16.560 --> 56:18.480\n And I think many of the best scientists,\n\n56:18.480 --> 56:19.880\n like Einstein comes to mind, right?\n\n56:19.880 --> 56:21.120\n Where these guys say, look,\n\n56:21.120 --> 56:25.400\n I didn't come up with these ideas by a conceptual analysis.\n\n56:25.400 --> 56:28.080\n I was thinking in vague images\n\n56:28.080 --> 56:31.760\n and it was just something nonconceptual.\n\n56:31.760 --> 56:33.760\n And then it took me a long, long time\n\n56:33.760 --> 56:35.880\n to pull it out into concepts\n\n56:35.880 --> 56:38.400\n and then longer to put it into math.\n\n56:38.400 --> 56:41.040\n But the real insights didn't come from data.\n\n56:41.040 --> 56:44.520\n The real insights didn't come from just slavishly\n\n56:44.520 --> 56:45.760\n playing with equations.\n\n56:45.760 --> 56:48.360\n They came from a deeper place.\n\n56:48.360 --> 56:51.640\n And so there may be this going back and forth\n\n56:51.640 --> 56:54.720\n between the complete nonconceptual\n\n56:54.720 --> 56:57.680\n where there's essentially no end to the wisdom\n\n56:57.680 --> 56:58.840\n and then conceptual systems\n\n56:58.840 --> 57:02.240\n where there's the girdle limits that we have to that.\n\n57:02.240 --> 57:05.520\n And that may be, if consciousness is important\n\n57:05.520 --> 57:07.640\n and fundamental, that may be what consciousness,\n\n57:07.640 --> 57:09.400\n at least part of what consciousness is about\n\n57:09.400 --> 57:13.440\n is this discovering itself, discovering its possibilities,\n\n57:13.440 --> 57:16.240\n so to speak, and we can talk about what that might mean,\n\n57:17.240 --> 57:20.920\n by going from the nonconceptual to the conceptual\n\n57:20.920 --> 57:22.180\n and back and forth.\n\n57:23.400 --> 57:26.440\n So you get better and better and better at being.\n\n57:26.440 --> 57:27.480\n Right.\n\n57:27.480 --> 57:29.920\n Let me ask you just to linger on the evolutionary,\n\n57:31.080 --> 57:33.160\n because you mentioned evolutionary game theory\n\n57:33.160 --> 57:35.280\n and that's really where you,\n\n57:35.280 --> 57:37.120\n the perspective from which you come\n\n57:37.120 --> 57:40.180\n to form the case against reality.\n\n57:42.080 --> 57:45.360\n At which point in our evolutionary history\n\n57:45.360 --> 57:49.520\n do we start to deviate the most from reality?\n\n57:49.520 --> 57:54.520\n Is it way before life even originated on Earth?\n\n57:55.800 --> 58:00.800\n Is it in the early development from bacteria and so on?\n\n58:02.280 --> 58:05.880\n Or is it when some inklings of what we think of\n\n58:05.880 --> 58:10.880\n as intelligence or maybe even complex consciousness\n\n58:11.680 --> 58:12.920\n started to emerge?\n\n58:12.920 --> 58:14.880\n So where did this deviation,\n\n58:15.980 --> 58:19.520\n just like with the interfaces in a computer,\n\n58:19.520 --> 58:23.960\n you start with transistors and then you have assembly\n\n58:23.960 --> 58:28.160\n and then you have C, C++, then you have Python,\n\n58:28.160 --> 58:30.320\n then you have GUIs, all that kind,\n\n58:30.320 --> 58:31.520\n you have layers upon layers.\n\n58:31.520 --> 58:33.360\n When did we start to deviate?\n\n58:33.360 --> 58:36.340\n Well, David Marr, again, my advisor at MIT,\n\n58:37.520 --> 58:38.960\n in his book, Vision,\n\n58:38.960 --> 58:42.380\n suggested that the more primitive sensory systems\n\n58:42.380 --> 58:45.840\n were less realistic, less theoretical,\n\n58:45.840 --> 58:47.040\n but that by the time you got to something\n\n58:47.040 --> 58:48.280\n as complicated as the humans,\n\n58:48.280 --> 58:51.640\n we were actually estimating the true shapes\n\n58:51.640 --> 58:53.400\n and distances to objects and so forth.\n\n58:53.400 --> 58:57.120\n So his point of view, and I think it was probably,\n\n58:57.120 --> 59:01.680\n it's not an uncommon view among my colleagues\n\n59:01.680 --> 59:06.200\n that, yeah, the sensory systems of lower creatures\n\n59:06.200 --> 59:07.580\n may just not be complicated enough\n\n59:07.580 --> 59:10.040\n to give them much, much truth.\n\n59:10.040 --> 59:12.880\n But as you get to 86 million neurons,\n\n59:12.880 --> 59:14.080\n you can now compute the truth,\n\n59:14.080 --> 59:17.120\n or at least the parts of the truth that we need.\n\n59:17.120 --> 59:19.260\n When I look at evolutionary game theory,\n\n59:21.680 --> 59:24.120\n one of my graduate students, Justin Mark,\n\n59:24.120 --> 59:27.700\n did some simulations using genetic algorithms.\n\n59:27.700 --> 59:30.640\n So there he was just exploring,\n\n59:30.640 --> 59:32.160\n we start off with random organisms,\n\n59:32.160 --> 59:36.360\n random sensory genetics and random actions.\n\n59:36.360 --> 59:38.560\n And the first generation was unbelievably,\n\n59:38.560 --> 59:39.720\n it was a foraging situation.\n\n59:39.720 --> 59:41.360\n They were foraging for resources.\n\n59:41.360 --> 59:44.180\n Most of them stayed in one place,\n\n59:44.180 --> 59:45.680\n didn't do anything important.\n\n59:47.160 --> 59:51.180\n But we could then just look at how the genes evolved.\n\n59:51.180 --> 59:53.280\n And what we found was,\n\n59:55.080 --> 59:59.960\n what he found was that basically you never even saw\n\n59:59.960 --> 1:00:04.960\n the truth organisms even come on the stage.\n\n1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:07.840\n If they came up, they were gone in one generation,\n\n1:00:07.840 --> 1:00:09.440\n they just weren't.\n\n1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:14.440\n So they came and went even just in one generation.\n\n1:00:14.720 --> 1:00:16.340\n They just are not good enough.\n\n1:00:16.340 --> 1:00:18.020\n The ones that were just tracking,\n\n1:00:18.020 --> 1:00:20.900\n their senses just were tracking the fitness payoffs\n\n1:00:20.900 --> 1:00:25.900\n were far more fit than the truth seekers.\n\n1:00:25.900 --> 1:00:29.260\n So an answer at one level,\n\n1:00:29.260 --> 1:00:30.500\n I want to give an answer at a deeper level,\n\n1:00:30.500 --> 1:00:32.860\n but just with evolutionary game theory,\n\n1:00:32.860 --> 1:00:36.140\n because my attitude as a scientist is,\n\n1:00:36.140 --> 1:00:37.940\n I don't believe any of our theories.\n\n1:00:38.900 --> 1:00:40.220\n I take them very, very seriously.\n\n1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:42.020\n I study them, I look at their implications,\n\n1:00:42.020 --> 1:00:43.580\n but none of them are the gospel.\n\n1:00:43.580 --> 1:00:46.020\n They're just the latest ideas that we have.\n\n1:00:46.020 --> 1:00:49.340\n And so the reason I study evolutionary game theory\n\n1:00:49.340 --> 1:00:52.460\n is because that's the best tool we have right now\n\n1:00:52.460 --> 1:00:53.780\n in this area.\n\n1:00:53.780 --> 1:00:56.300\n There is nothing else that competes.\n\n1:00:56.300 --> 1:00:58.500\n And so as a scientist, it's my responsibility\n\n1:00:58.500 --> 1:01:01.020\n to take the best tools and see what they mean.\n\n1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:02.620\n And the same thing the physicists are doing.\n\n1:01:02.620 --> 1:01:03.820\n They're taking the best tools\n\n1:01:03.820 --> 1:01:06.220\n and looking at what they entail.\n\n1:01:06.220 --> 1:01:10.660\n But I think that science now has enough experience\n\n1:01:10.660 --> 1:01:14.180\n to realize that we should not believe our theories\n\n1:01:14.180 --> 1:01:17.020\n in the sense that we've now arrived.\n\n1:01:17.020 --> 1:01:21.500\n In 1890, a lot of physicists thought we'd arrived.\n\n1:01:21.500 --> 1:01:25.780\n They were discouraging bright young students\n\n1:01:25.780 --> 1:01:27.900\n from going into physics, because it was all done.\n\n1:01:27.900 --> 1:01:31.540\n And that's precisely the wrong attitude forever.\n\n1:01:31.540 --> 1:01:33.700\n It's the wrong attitude forever.\n\n1:01:33.700 --> 1:01:37.740\n The attitude we should have is a century from now,\n\n1:01:37.740 --> 1:01:39.700\n they'll be looking at us and laughing\n\n1:01:39.700 --> 1:01:40.820\n at what we didn't know.\n\n1:01:40.820 --> 1:01:43.300\n And we just have to assume that that's going to be the case.\n\n1:01:43.300 --> 1:01:45.300\n Just know that everything that we think\n\n1:01:45.300 --> 1:01:48.460\n is so brilliant right now, our final theory.\n\n1:01:48.460 --> 1:01:50.060\n A century from now, they'll look at us\n\n1:01:50.060 --> 1:01:52.780\n like we look at the physicists of 1890 and go,\n\n1:01:52.780 --> 1:01:54.620\n how could they have been so dumb?\n\n1:01:54.620 --> 1:01:56.900\n So I don't want to make that mistake.\n\n1:01:56.900 --> 1:02:00.220\n So I'm not doctrinaire about any\n\n1:02:00.220 --> 1:02:02.100\n of our current scientific theories.\n\n1:02:02.100 --> 1:02:05.500\n I am doctrinaire about this.\n\n1:02:05.500 --> 1:02:08.260\n We should use the best tools we have right now.\n\n1:02:08.260 --> 1:02:09.100\n That's what we've got.\n\n1:02:09.100 --> 1:02:10.340\n And with humility.\n\n1:02:10.340 --> 1:02:13.740\n Well, so let me ask you about game theory.\n\n1:02:13.740 --> 1:02:18.100\n I love game theory, evolutionary game theory.\n\n1:02:18.100 --> 1:02:23.100\n But I'm always suspicious of it, like economics.\n\n1:02:23.500 --> 1:02:25.860\n When you construct models,\n\n1:02:25.860 --> 1:02:30.500\n it's too easy to construct things that oversimplify\n\n1:02:31.380 --> 1:02:34.420\n just because we, our human brains,\n\n1:02:34.420 --> 1:02:39.020\n enjoy the simplification of constructing a few variables\n\n1:02:39.020 --> 1:02:43.100\n that somehow represent organisms or represent people\n\n1:02:43.100 --> 1:02:45.580\n and running a simulation that then allows you\n\n1:02:45.580 --> 1:02:48.460\n to build up intuition and then it feels really good\n\n1:02:48.460 --> 1:02:50.420\n because you can get some really deep\n\n1:02:50.420 --> 1:02:51.980\n and surprising intuitions.\n\n1:02:51.980 --> 1:02:55.260\n But how do you know your models aren't,\n\n1:02:55.260 --> 1:02:57.200\n the assumptions underlying your models\n\n1:02:57.200 --> 1:02:58.900\n aren't some fundamentally flawed?\n\n1:02:58.900 --> 1:03:00.700\n And because of that,\n\n1:03:00.700 --> 1:03:03.020\n your conclusions are fundamentally flawed.\n\n1:03:03.020 --> 1:03:06.220\n So I guess my question is what are the limits\n\n1:03:06.220 --> 1:03:08.860\n in your use of game theory, evolution game theory,\n\n1:03:08.860 --> 1:03:10.220\n your experience with it?\n\n1:03:10.220 --> 1:03:12.460\n What are the limits of game theory?\n\n1:03:12.460 --> 1:03:15.780\n So I've gotten some pushback from professional colleagues\n\n1:03:15.780 --> 1:03:19.340\n and friends who have tried to rerun simulations\n\n1:03:19.340 --> 1:03:21.840\n and try to, the idea that we don't see the truth\n\n1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:24.220\n is not comfortable and so many of my colleagues\n\n1:03:24.220 --> 1:03:26.420\n are very interested in trying to show that we're wrong.\n\n1:03:26.420 --> 1:03:28.620\n And so the idea would be to say that somehow\n\n1:03:28.620 --> 1:03:30.580\n we did something, as you're suggesting,\n\n1:03:30.580 --> 1:03:33.740\n maybe something special that wasn't completely general.\n\n1:03:33.740 --> 1:03:36.980\n We got some little special part of the whole search space\n\n1:03:36.980 --> 1:03:39.580\n in evolutionary game theory in which this happens to be true\n\n1:03:39.580 --> 1:03:42.100\n but more generally organisms would evolve\n\n1:03:42.100 --> 1:03:42.940\n to see the truth.\n\n1:03:42.940 --> 1:03:48.100\n So the best pushback we've gotten is from a team at Yale.\n\n1:03:48.100 --> 1:03:52.180\n And they suggested that if you use\n\n1:03:52.180 --> 1:03:53.980\n thousands of payoff functions,\n\n1:03:53.980 --> 1:03:57.140\n so we in our simulations, we just use a couple,\n\n1:03:57.140 --> 1:04:00.300\n one or two, because it was our first simulations, right?\n\n1:04:00.300 --> 1:04:01.220\n So that would be a limit.\n\n1:04:01.220 --> 1:04:02.380\n We had one or two payoff functions,\n\n1:04:02.380 --> 1:04:03.900\n we showed the result of those,\n\n1:04:05.100 --> 1:04:07.060\n at least for the genetic algorithms.\n\n1:04:07.060 --> 1:04:10.460\n And they said, if you have 20,000 of them,\n\n1:04:10.460 --> 1:04:12.740\n then we can find these conditions in which\n\n1:04:14.260 --> 1:04:17.260\n truth seeing organisms would be the ones\n\n1:04:17.260 --> 1:04:19.340\n that evolved and survived.\n\n1:04:19.340 --> 1:04:21.140\n And so we looked at their simulations\n\n1:04:21.140 --> 1:04:25.180\n and it certainly is the case that you can find\n\n1:04:25.180 --> 1:04:27.580\n special cases in which truth can evolve.\n\n1:04:27.580 --> 1:04:29.140\n So when I say it's probability zero,\n\n1:04:29.140 --> 1:04:30.140\n it doesn't mean it can't happen.\n\n1:04:30.140 --> 1:04:32.980\n It can happen, in fact, it could happen infinitely often.\n\n1:04:32.980 --> 1:04:34.380\n It's just probability zero.\n\n1:04:34.380 --> 1:04:38.260\n So probability zero things can happen infinitely often.\n\n1:04:38.260 --> 1:04:40.380\n When you say probability is zero, you mean probability\n\n1:04:40.380 --> 1:04:42.020\n close to zero.\n\n1:04:42.020 --> 1:04:43.140\n To be very, very precise.\n\n1:04:43.140 --> 1:04:46.740\n So for example, if I have a unit square on the plane\n\n1:04:48.780 --> 1:04:53.180\n and I use a measure on a probability measure\n\n1:04:53.180 --> 1:04:56.300\n in which the area of a region is this probability.\n\n1:04:58.340 --> 1:05:02.420\n Then if I draw a curve in that unit square,\n\n1:05:02.420 --> 1:05:05.500\n it has measure precisely zero,\n\n1:05:05.500 --> 1:05:07.820\n precisely not approximately, precisely zero.\n\n1:05:07.820 --> 1:05:10.100\n And yet it has infinitely many points.\n\n1:05:10.100 --> 1:05:12.180\n So there's an object that for that probability measure\n\n1:05:12.180 --> 1:05:14.020\n has probability zero, and yet there's\n\n1:05:14.020 --> 1:05:16.260\n infinitely many points in it.\n\n1:05:16.260 --> 1:05:19.060\n So that's what I mean when I say that things\n\n1:05:19.060 --> 1:05:20.300\n that are probability zero can happen\n\n1:05:20.300 --> 1:05:21.780\n infinitely often in principle.\n\n1:05:21.780 --> 1:05:26.500\n Yeah, but infinity, as far as, and I look outside often,\n\n1:05:26.500 --> 1:05:29.180\n I walk around and I look at people.\n\n1:05:29.180 --> 1:05:31.600\n I have never seen infinity in real life.\n\n1:05:32.860 --> 1:05:35.980\n That's an interesting issue.\n\n1:05:35.980 --> 1:05:37.540\n I've been looking, I've been looking.\n\n1:05:37.540 --> 1:05:41.220\n I don't notice it, infinitely small or the infinitely big.\n\n1:05:41.220 --> 1:05:43.360\n And so the tools of mathematics,\n\n1:05:43.360 --> 1:05:45.700\n you could sort of apply the same kind of criticism\n\n1:05:45.700 --> 1:05:49.220\n that it is a very convenient interface into our reality.\n\n1:05:49.220 --> 1:05:50.500\n That's a big debate in mathematics,\n\n1:05:50.500 --> 1:05:52.260\n the intuitionists versus the ones who take,\n\n1:05:52.260 --> 1:05:55.140\n for example, the real numbers as real.\n\n1:05:55.140 --> 1:05:57.080\n And that's a fun discussion.\n\n1:05:57.080 --> 1:05:59.060\n Nicholas Giesen, a physicist,\n\n1:05:59.060 --> 1:06:00.900\n has really interesting work recently\n\n1:06:00.900 --> 1:06:04.160\n on how if you go with intuitionist mathematics,\n\n1:06:04.160 --> 1:06:09.160\n you could effectively quantize Newton,\n\n1:06:10.020 --> 1:06:12.460\n and you find that the Newtonian theory\n\n1:06:12.460 --> 1:06:14.460\n and quantum theory aren't that different\n\n1:06:14.460 --> 1:06:16.540\n once you go with it.\n\n1:06:16.540 --> 1:06:17.380\n It's funny.\n\n1:06:17.380 --> 1:06:18.220\n It's really quite interesting.\n\n1:06:18.220 --> 1:06:21.040\n So the issue he raises is a very, very deep one,\n\n1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:23.780\n and one that I think we should take quite seriously,\n\n1:06:23.780 --> 1:06:27.660\n which is how should we think about the reality\n\n1:06:27.660 --> 1:06:30.420\n of the contours hierarchy?\n\n1:06:30.420 --> 1:06:35.420\n Aleph one, aleph two, and all these different infinities\n\n1:06:35.860 --> 1:06:40.860\n versus just a more algorithmic approach, right?\n\n1:06:41.660 --> 1:06:44.700\n So where everything's computable,\n\n1:06:44.700 --> 1:06:46.420\n in some sense, everything's finite,\n\n1:06:46.420 --> 1:06:49.780\n as big as you want, but nevertheless finite.\n\n1:06:50.620 --> 1:06:52.560\n So yeah, that ultimately boils down to\n\n1:06:52.560 --> 1:06:56.820\n whether the world is discrete or continuous\n\n1:06:56.820 --> 1:06:59.320\n in some general sense.\n\n1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:01.220\n And again, we can't really know,\n\n1:07:01.220 --> 1:07:05.500\n but there's just a mind breaking thought,\n\n1:07:05.500 --> 1:07:07.340\n just common sense reasoning,\n\n1:07:07.340 --> 1:07:09.880\n that something can happen,\n\n1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:13.820\n and as yet, probability of it happening is 0%.\n\n1:07:13.820 --> 1:07:18.140\n That doesn't compute for common sense computer.\n\n1:07:18.140 --> 1:07:18.980\n Right.\n\n1:07:18.980 --> 1:07:21.780\n This is where you have to be a sharp mathematician\n\n1:07:21.780 --> 1:07:23.460\n to really, and I'm not.\n\n1:07:23.460 --> 1:07:24.980\n Sharp is one word.\n\n1:07:24.980 --> 1:07:27.420\n What I'm saying is common sense computer is,\n\n1:07:27.420 --> 1:07:31.940\n I mean that in a very kind of,\n\n1:07:33.340 --> 1:07:35.120\n in a positive sense,\n\n1:07:35.120 --> 1:07:37.300\n because we've been talking about perception systems\n\n1:07:37.300 --> 1:07:42.140\n and interfaces, if we are to reason about the world,\n\n1:07:42.140 --> 1:07:45.060\n we have to use the best interfaces we got.\n\n1:07:45.060 --> 1:07:50.060\n And I'm not exactly sure that game theory\n\n1:07:50.340 --> 1:07:52.780\n is the best interface we got for this.\n\n1:07:52.780 --> 1:07:53.620\n Oh, right.\n\n1:07:53.620 --> 1:07:57.740\n In application of mathematics, tricks and tools\n\n1:07:57.740 --> 1:08:00.620\n in mathematics, the game theory is the best we got\n\n1:08:00.620 --> 1:08:03.980\n when we are thinking about the nature of reality\n\n1:08:03.980 --> 1:08:07.020\n and fitness functions and evolution, period.\n\n1:08:07.020 --> 1:08:07.860\n Right.\n\n1:08:07.860 --> 1:08:10.080\n Well, that's a fair rejoinder,\n\n1:08:10.080 --> 1:08:14.100\n and I think that that was the tool that we used.\n\n1:08:14.100 --> 1:08:17.360\n And if someone says, here's a better mathematical tool\n\n1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:20.260\n and here's why, this mathematical tool\n\n1:08:20.260 --> 1:08:23.300\n better captures the essence of Darwin's idea,\n\n1:08:23.300 --> 1:08:24.980\n John Maynard Smith didn't quite get it\n\n1:08:24.980 --> 1:08:26.300\n with evolutionary game theory.\n\n1:08:26.300 --> 1:08:27.540\n There's this thing.\n\n1:08:27.540 --> 1:08:30.660\n Now there are tools like evolutionary graph theory,\n\n1:08:30.660 --> 1:08:32.900\n which generalize evolutionary game theory,\n\n1:08:32.900 --> 1:08:35.580\n and then there's quantum game theory.\n\n1:08:35.580 --> 1:08:40.580\n So you can use quantum tools like entanglement,\n\n1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:44.460\n for example, as a resource in games\n\n1:08:44.460 --> 1:08:48.660\n that change the very nature of the solutions,\n\n1:08:48.660 --> 1:08:50.700\n the optimal solutions of the game theory.\n\n1:08:50.700 --> 1:08:54.420\n Well, the work from Yale is really interesting.\n\n1:08:54.420 --> 1:08:58.400\n It's a really interesting challenge of these ideas\n\n1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:00.940\n where, okay, if you have a very large number\n\n1:09:00.940 --> 1:09:03.220\n of fitness functions, or let's say you have\n\n1:09:04.380 --> 1:09:07.500\n a nearly infinite number of fitness functions\n\n1:09:07.500 --> 1:09:09.220\n or a growing number of fitness functions,\n\n1:09:09.220 --> 1:09:13.740\n what kind of interesting things start to emerging\n\n1:09:13.740 --> 1:09:15.540\n if you are to be an organism?\n\n1:09:15.540 --> 1:09:18.860\n If to be an organism that adapts means\n\n1:09:18.860 --> 1:09:22.420\n having to deal with an ensemble of fitness functions.\n\n1:09:23.340 --> 1:09:28.340\n Right, and so we've actually redone some of our own work\n\n1:09:28.500 --> 1:09:30.300\n based on theirs, and this is the back and forth\n\n1:09:30.300 --> 1:09:32.300\n that we expect in science, right?\n\n1:09:32.300 --> 1:09:36.380\n And what we found was that in their simulations,\n\n1:09:36.380 --> 1:09:39.140\n they were assuming that you couldn't carve the world\n\n1:09:39.140 --> 1:09:42.040\n up into objects, and so we said,\n\n1:09:42.040 --> 1:09:43.940\n well, let's relax that assumption.\n\n1:09:43.940 --> 1:09:45.980\n Allow organisms to create data structures\n\n1:09:45.980 --> 1:09:47.720\n that we might call objects,\n\n1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:49.420\n and an object would be you take,\n\n1:09:49.420 --> 1:09:51.580\n you would do hierarchical clustering\n\n1:09:51.580 --> 1:09:53.180\n of your fitness payoff functions,\n\n1:09:53.180 --> 1:09:54.860\n the ones that have similar shapes.\n\n1:09:54.860 --> 1:09:58.300\n If you have 20,000 of them, maybe these 50\n\n1:09:58.300 --> 1:09:59.540\n are all very, very similar,\n\n1:09:59.540 --> 1:10:03.620\n so I can take all the perception, action, fitness stuff\n\n1:10:03.620 --> 1:10:05.700\n and make that into a data structure,\n\n1:10:05.700 --> 1:10:08.300\n and we'll call that a unit or an object.\n\n1:10:08.300 --> 1:10:09.640\n And as soon as we did that,\n\n1:10:09.640 --> 1:10:11.600\n then all of their results went away.\n\n1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:13.400\n It turned out they were the special case\n\n1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:16.660\n and that the organisms that were allowed\n\n1:10:16.660 --> 1:10:21.460\n to only see, that were shaped to see only fitness payoffs\n\n1:10:21.460 --> 1:10:22.940\n were the ones that were.\n\n1:10:22.940 --> 1:10:25.340\n So the idea is that objects then,\n\n1:10:25.340 --> 1:10:27.140\n what are objects from an evolutionary point of view?\n\n1:10:27.140 --> 1:10:30.180\n This bottle, we thought that when I saw a bottle,\n\n1:10:30.180 --> 1:10:31.780\n it was because I was seeing a true object\n\n1:10:31.780 --> 1:10:34.400\n that existed whether or not it was perceived.\n\n1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:37.980\n Evolutionary theories suggest a different interpretation.\n\n1:10:37.980 --> 1:10:41.160\n I'm seeing a data structure that is encoding\n\n1:10:42.300 --> 1:10:45.420\n a convenient way of looking at various fitness payoffs.\n\n1:10:45.420 --> 1:10:48.300\n I can use this for drinking.\n\n1:10:48.300 --> 1:10:50.740\n I could use it as a weapon, not a very good one.\n\n1:10:50.740 --> 1:10:52.840\n I could be somewhere with head with it.\n\n1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:56.580\n If my goal is mating, this is pointless.\n\n1:10:56.580 --> 1:10:59.640\n So I'm seeing for, what I'm coding here\n\n1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:04.180\n is all sorts of actions and the payoffs that I could get.\n\n1:11:04.180 --> 1:11:05.460\n When I pick up an apple,\n\n1:11:05.460 --> 1:11:08.680\n now I'm getting a different set of actions and payoffs.\n\n1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:11.700\n When I pick up a rock, I'm getting, so for every object,\n\n1:11:11.700 --> 1:11:16.100\n what I'm getting is a different set of payoff functions\n\n1:11:16.100 --> 1:11:18.180\n and with various actions.\n\n1:11:18.180 --> 1:11:20.660\n And so once you allow that,\n\n1:11:20.660 --> 1:11:25.620\n then what you find is once again that truth goes extinct\n\n1:11:25.620 --> 1:11:28.020\n and the organisms that just get an interface\n\n1:11:28.020 --> 1:11:29.540\n are the ones that win.\n\n1:11:29.540 --> 1:11:33.220\n But the question, just sneaking up on, this is fascinating.\n\n1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:38.180\n From where do fitness functions originate?\n\n1:11:38.180 --> 1:11:40.100\n What gives birth to the fitness functions?\n\n1:11:40.100 --> 1:11:43.340\n So if there's a giant black box\n\n1:11:43.340 --> 1:11:45.180\n that just keeps giving you fitness functions,\n\n1:11:45.180 --> 1:11:46.220\n what are we trying to optimize?\n\n1:11:46.220 --> 1:11:51.220\n You said that water has different uses than an apple.\n\n1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:57.000\n So there's these objects.\n\n1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:58.860\n What are we trying to optimize?\n\n1:11:58.860 --> 1:12:02.740\n And why is not reality a really good generator\n\n1:12:02.740 --> 1:12:03.840\n of fitness functions?\n\n1:12:05.380 --> 1:12:07.760\n So each theory makes its own assumptions and says,\n\n1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:09.660\n grant me this, then I'll explain that.\n\n1:12:09.660 --> 1:12:11.020\n So evolutionary game theory says,\n\n1:12:11.020 --> 1:12:13.420\n grant me fitness payoffs, right?\n\n1:12:13.420 --> 1:12:16.340\n And grant me strategies with payoffs.\n\n1:12:16.340 --> 1:12:18.540\n And I can write down the matrix\n\n1:12:18.540 --> 1:12:20.340\n for this strategy interacts with that strategy.\n\n1:12:20.340 --> 1:12:21.660\n These are the payoffs that come up.\n\n1:12:21.660 --> 1:12:22.500\n If you grant me that,\n\n1:12:22.500 --> 1:12:24.560\n then I can start to explain a lot of things.\n\n1:12:24.560 --> 1:12:26.460\n Now you can ask for a deeper question like,\n\n1:12:26.460 --> 1:12:31.460\n okay, how does physics evolve biology\n\n1:12:32.100 --> 1:12:36.100\n and where do these fitness payoffs come from, right?\n\n1:12:36.100 --> 1:12:41.100\n Now that's a completely different enterprise.\n\n1:12:41.380 --> 1:12:43.160\n And of course, evolutionary game theory then\n\n1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:45.360\n would be not the right tool for that.\n\n1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:46.500\n It would have to be a deeper tool\n\n1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:49.320\n that shows where evolutionary game theory comes from.\n\n1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:55.220\n My own take is that there's gonna be a problem\n\n1:12:55.220 --> 1:13:00.220\n in doing that because space time isn't fundamental.\n\n1:13:01.820 --> 1:13:03.360\n It's just a user interface.\n\n1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:06.220\n And that the distinction that we make\n\n1:13:06.220 --> 1:13:08.500\n between living and nonliving\n\n1:13:08.500 --> 1:13:10.620\n is not a fundamental distinction.\n\n1:13:10.620 --> 1:13:15.140\n It's an artifact of the limits of our interface, right?\n\n1:13:15.140 --> 1:13:18.040\n So this is a new wrinkle and this is an important wrinkle.\n\n1:13:19.380 --> 1:13:22.260\n It's so nice to take space and time as fundamental\n\n1:13:22.260 --> 1:13:24.280\n because if something looks like it's inanimate,\n\n1:13:24.280 --> 1:13:27.180\n it's inanimate and we can just say it's not living.\n\n1:13:27.180 --> 1:13:30.740\n Now it's much more complicated.\n\n1:13:30.740 --> 1:13:32.200\n Certain things are obviously living.\n\n1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:35.560\n I'm talking with you, I'm obviously interacting\n\n1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:38.660\n with something that's alive and conscious.\n\n1:13:38.660 --> 1:13:40.700\n I think we've let go of the word obviously\n\n1:13:40.700 --> 1:13:42.020\n in this conversation.\n\n1:13:42.020 --> 1:13:43.500\n I think nothing is obvious.\n\n1:13:43.500 --> 1:13:45.280\n Nothing's obvious, that's right.\n\n1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:48.700\n But when we get down to like an ant,\n\n1:13:48.700 --> 1:13:52.580\n it's obviously living, but I'll say it appears to be living.\n\n1:13:52.580 --> 1:13:55.600\n But when we get down to a virus, now people wonder\n\n1:13:55.600 --> 1:13:57.260\n and when we get down to protons,\n\n1:13:57.260 --> 1:13:58.840\n people say it's not living.\n\n1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:02.780\n And my attitude is look, I have a user interface.\n\n1:14:02.780 --> 1:14:05.780\n Interface is there to hide certain aspects of reality\n\n1:14:05.780 --> 1:14:10.780\n and others to, it's an uneven representation,\n\n1:14:11.100 --> 1:14:11.980\n put it that way.\n\n1:14:11.980 --> 1:14:14.920\n Certain things just get completely hidden.\n\n1:14:14.920 --> 1:14:18.580\n Dark matter and dark energy are most of the energy\n\n1:14:18.580 --> 1:14:19.780\n and matter that's out there.\n\n1:14:19.780 --> 1:14:22.160\n Our interface just plain flat out hides them.\n\n1:14:23.380 --> 1:14:25.600\n The only way we get some hint is because\n\n1:14:25.600 --> 1:14:28.740\n gravitational things are going wrong within our,\n\n1:14:28.740 --> 1:14:31.980\n so most things are outside of our interface.\n\n1:14:31.980 --> 1:14:34.180\n The distinction between living and nonliving\n\n1:14:35.140 --> 1:14:35.980\n is not fundamental.\n\n1:14:35.980 --> 1:14:37.200\n It's an artifact of our interface.\n\n1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:41.900\n So if we really, really want to understand\n\n1:14:41.900 --> 1:14:43.360\n where evolution comes from,\n\n1:14:44.740 --> 1:14:46.740\n to answer the question, the deep question you asked,\n\n1:14:46.740 --> 1:14:48.660\n I think the right way we're gonna have to do that\n\n1:14:48.660 --> 1:14:51.100\n is to come up with a deeper theory than space time\n\n1:14:52.140 --> 1:14:54.300\n in which there may not be the notion of time\n\n1:14:54.300 --> 1:14:59.300\n and show that whatever this dynamics of that deeper theory\n\n1:15:00.420 --> 1:15:03.900\n is, by the way, I'll talk about how you could have dynamics\n\n1:15:03.900 --> 1:15:07.140\n without time, but the dynamics of this deeper theory,\n\n1:15:07.140 --> 1:15:11.020\n when we project it into, in certain ways,\n\n1:15:11.020 --> 1:15:13.060\n then we do get space time and we get what appears\n\n1:15:13.060 --> 1:15:15.060\n to be evolution by natural selection.\n\n1:15:15.060 --> 1:15:17.760\n So I would love to see evolution by natural selection,\n\n1:15:17.760 --> 1:15:20.220\n nature, red and tooth and claw, people fighting,\n\n1:15:20.220 --> 1:15:22.220\n animals fighting for resources and the whole bit,\n\n1:15:22.220 --> 1:15:24.260\n come out of a deeper theory in which perhaps\n\n1:15:24.260 --> 1:15:27.260\n it's all cooperation, there's no limited resources\n\n1:15:27.260 --> 1:15:30.660\n and so forth, but as a result of projection,\n\n1:15:30.660 --> 1:15:33.580\n you get space and time, and as a result of projection,\n\n1:15:33.580 --> 1:15:35.420\n you get nature, red and tooth and claw,\n\n1:15:35.420 --> 1:15:38.420\n the appearance of it, but it's all an artifact\n\n1:15:38.420 --> 1:15:39.260\n of the interface.\n\n1:15:39.260 --> 1:15:43.220\n I like this idea that the line between living\n\n1:15:43.220 --> 1:15:44.940\n and nonliving is very important\n\n1:15:46.620 --> 1:15:48.660\n because that's the thing that would emerge\n\n1:15:48.660 --> 1:15:52.420\n before you have evolution, the idea of death.\n\n1:15:55.220 --> 1:15:58.900\n So that seems to be an important component\n\n1:15:58.900 --> 1:16:01.060\n of natural selection, and if that emerged,\n\n1:16:01.060 --> 1:16:05.540\n because that's also asking the question,\n\n1:16:05.540 --> 1:16:09.100\n I guess, that I ask, where do fitness functions come from?\n\n1:16:09.100 --> 1:16:12.980\n That's like asking the old meaning of life question, right?\n\n1:16:12.980 --> 1:16:17.500\n It's the why, why, why?\n\n1:16:17.500 --> 1:16:20.300\n And one of the big underlying whys,\n\n1:16:20.300 --> 1:16:22.660\n okay, you can start with evolution on Earth,\n\n1:16:22.660 --> 1:16:26.100\n but without living, without life and death,\n\n1:16:26.100 --> 1:16:28.700\n without the line between the living and the dead,\n\n1:16:28.700 --> 1:16:30.500\n you don't have evolution.\n\n1:16:30.500 --> 1:16:32.540\n So what if underneath it, there's no such thing\n\n1:16:32.540 --> 1:16:33.900\n as the living and the dead?\n\n1:16:35.020 --> 1:16:39.500\n There's no, like this concept of an organism, period.\n\n1:16:39.500 --> 1:16:42.700\n There's a living organism that's defined\n\n1:16:42.700 --> 1:16:47.700\n by a volume in space time that somehow interacts,\n\n1:16:48.340 --> 1:16:52.820\n that over time maintains its integrity somehow.\n\n1:16:52.820 --> 1:16:56.540\n It has some kind of history, it has a wall of some kind.\n\n1:16:56.540 --> 1:16:58.340\n The outside world, the environment,\n\n1:16:58.340 --> 1:17:00.740\n and then inside, there's an organism.\n\n1:17:00.740 --> 1:17:02.900\n So you're defining an organism,\n\n1:17:02.900 --> 1:17:04.860\n and also you define that organism\n\n1:17:04.860 --> 1:17:09.860\n by the fact that it can move, and it can become alive,\n\n1:17:10.220 --> 1:17:12.540\n which you kind of think of as moving,\n\n1:17:12.540 --> 1:17:14.700\n combined with the fact that it's keeping itself\n\n1:17:14.700 --> 1:17:15.980\n separate from the environment,\n\n1:17:15.980 --> 1:17:17.900\n so you can point out that thing is living,\n\n1:17:17.900 --> 1:17:19.580\n and then it can also die.\n\n1:17:21.060 --> 1:17:26.060\n That seems to be all very powerful components of space time\n\n1:17:26.340 --> 1:17:28.380\n that enable you to have something\n\n1:17:28.380 --> 1:17:31.660\n like natural selection and evolution.\n\n1:17:31.660 --> 1:17:33.140\n Well, and there's a lot of interesting work,\n\n1:17:33.140 --> 1:17:36.180\n some of it by collaborators of Carl Friston and others,\n\n1:17:36.180 --> 1:17:40.940\n where they have Bayes net kind of stuff\n\n1:17:40.940 --> 1:17:43.780\n that they build on the notion of a Markov blanket.\n\n1:17:43.780 --> 1:17:47.180\n So you have some states within this network\n\n1:17:47.180 --> 1:17:49.100\n that are inside the blanket, then you have the blanket,\n\n1:17:49.100 --> 1:17:50.780\n and then the states outside the blanket.\n\n1:17:50.780 --> 1:17:52.940\n And the states inside this Markov blanket\n\n1:17:52.940 --> 1:17:54.260\n are conditionally independent of the states\n\n1:17:54.260 --> 1:17:57.380\n outside the blanket conditioned on the blanket.\n\n1:17:57.380 --> 1:18:02.020\n And what they're looking at is that the dynamics inside\n\n1:18:02.020 --> 1:18:04.460\n of the states inside the Markov blanket\n\n1:18:04.460 --> 1:18:07.140\n seem to be trying to estimate properties of the outside\n\n1:18:07.140 --> 1:18:08.980\n and react to them in a way.\n\n1:18:08.980 --> 1:18:11.260\n So it seems like you're doing probabilistic inferences\n\n1:18:11.260 --> 1:18:14.220\n in ways that might be able to keep you alive.\n\n1:18:14.220 --> 1:18:17.540\n So there's interesting work going on in that direction.\n\n1:18:17.540 --> 1:18:21.540\n But what I'm saying is something slightly different,\n\n1:18:21.540 --> 1:18:24.780\n and that is, like, when I look at you,\n\n1:18:24.780 --> 1:18:26.380\n all I see is skin, hair, and eyes, right?\n\n1:18:26.380 --> 1:18:27.420\n That's all I see.\n\n1:18:27.420 --> 1:18:31.140\n But I know that there's a deeper reality.\n\n1:18:31.140 --> 1:18:32.580\n I believe that there's a much deeper reality.\n\n1:18:32.580 --> 1:18:34.220\n There's the whole world of your experiences,\n\n1:18:34.220 --> 1:18:35.780\n your thoughts, your hopes, your dreams.\n\n1:18:35.780 --> 1:18:39.820\n In some sense, the face that I see\n\n1:18:39.820 --> 1:18:42.020\n is just a symbol that I create, right?\n\n1:18:42.020 --> 1:18:44.740\n And as soon as I look away, I delete that symbol.\n\n1:18:44.740 --> 1:18:46.220\n But I don't delete you.\n\n1:18:46.220 --> 1:18:48.420\n I don't delete the conscious experience,\n\n1:18:48.420 --> 1:18:50.180\n the whole world of your...\n\n1:18:50.180 --> 1:18:53.420\n So I'm only deleting an interface symbol.\n\n1:18:53.420 --> 1:18:58.420\n But that interface symbol is a portal, so to speak.\n\n1:19:00.740 --> 1:19:04.300\n Not a perfect portal, but a genuine portal\n\n1:19:04.300 --> 1:19:07.260\n into your beliefs, into your conscious experiences.\n\n1:19:07.260 --> 1:19:09.940\n That's why we can have a conversation.\n\n1:19:09.940 --> 1:19:12.140\n Your consciousness is genuinely affecting mine,\n\n1:19:12.140 --> 1:19:13.820\n and mine is genuinely affecting yours,\n\n1:19:13.820 --> 1:19:17.580\n through these icons, which I create on the fly.\n\n1:19:17.580 --> 1:19:18.700\n I mean, I create your face.\n\n1:19:18.700 --> 1:19:20.060\n When I look, I delete it.\n\n1:19:20.060 --> 1:19:22.020\n I don't create you, your consciousness.\n\n1:19:22.020 --> 1:19:24.940\n That's there all the time, but I do...\n\n1:19:24.940 --> 1:19:27.380\n So now, when I look at a cat,\n\n1:19:27.380 --> 1:19:29.860\n I'm creating something that I still call living,\n\n1:19:29.860 --> 1:19:31.860\n and I still think is conscious.\n\n1:19:31.860 --> 1:19:34.660\n When I look at an ant, I create something\n\n1:19:34.660 --> 1:19:38.100\n that I still would call living, but maybe not conscious.\n\n1:19:38.100 --> 1:19:40.660\n When I look at something I call a virus,\n\n1:19:40.660 --> 1:19:42.860\n now I'm not even sure I would call it living.\n\n1:19:42.860 --> 1:19:45.380\n And when I look at a proton, I would say,\n\n1:19:45.380 --> 1:19:48.860\n I don't even think it's not alive at all.\n\n1:19:48.860 --> 1:19:53.580\n It could be that I'm nevertheless interacting\n\n1:19:53.580 --> 1:19:55.660\n with something that's just as conscious as you.\n\n1:19:55.660 --> 1:19:57.420\n I'm not saying the proton is conscious.\n\n1:19:57.420 --> 1:19:59.380\n The face that I'm creating when I look at you,\n\n1:19:59.380 --> 1:20:00.540\n that face is not conscious.\n\n1:20:00.540 --> 1:20:03.660\n That face is a data structure in me.\n\n1:20:03.660 --> 1:20:06.180\n That face is an experience.\n\n1:20:06.180 --> 1:20:07.420\n It's not an experiencer.\n\n1:20:08.660 --> 1:20:12.660\n Similarly, a proton is something that I create\n\n1:20:12.660 --> 1:20:15.020\n when I look or do a collision\n\n1:20:15.020 --> 1:20:18.180\n in the Large Hadron Collider or something like that.\n\n1:20:18.180 --> 1:20:21.380\n But what is behind the entity in space time?\n\n1:20:21.380 --> 1:20:23.140\n So I've got this space time interface,\n\n1:20:23.140 --> 1:20:25.540\n and I've just got this entity that I call a proton.\n\n1:20:25.540 --> 1:20:27.460\n What is the reality behind it?\n\n1:20:27.460 --> 1:20:30.500\n Well, the physicists are finding these big, big structures.\n\n1:20:30.500 --> 1:20:33.100\n The amplitude hadron, the sociahedron,\n\n1:20:33.100 --> 1:20:36.020\n cause what's behind those?\n\n1:20:36.020 --> 1:20:38.740\n Could be consciousness, what I'm playing with.\n\n1:20:38.740 --> 1:20:41.140\n In which case, when I'm interacting with a proton,\n\n1:20:42.140 --> 1:20:43.740\n I could be interacting with consciousness.\n\n1:20:43.740 --> 1:20:45.260\n Again, to be very, very clear,\n\n1:20:45.260 --> 1:20:46.980\n because it's easy to misunderstand,\n\n1:20:46.980 --> 1:20:49.300\n I'm not saying a proton is conscious.\n\n1:20:49.300 --> 1:20:51.340\n Just like I'm not saying your face is conscious.\n\n1:20:51.340 --> 1:20:56.060\n Your face is a symbol I create and then delete as I look.\n\n1:20:56.060 --> 1:20:57.380\n So your face is not conscious,\n\n1:20:57.380 --> 1:21:00.060\n but I know that that face in my interface,\n\n1:21:00.060 --> 1:21:01.860\n the Lex Friedman face that I create,\n\n1:21:01.860 --> 1:21:04.260\n is an interface symbol that's a genuine portal\n\n1:21:04.260 --> 1:21:06.060\n into your consciousness.\n\n1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:09.980\n The portal is less clear for a cat,\n\n1:21:09.980 --> 1:21:11.860\n even less clear for an ant.\n\n1:21:11.860 --> 1:21:13.380\n And by the time we get down to a proton,\n\n1:21:13.380 --> 1:21:15.900\n the portal is not clear at all.\n\n1:21:15.900 --> 1:21:17.140\n But that doesn't mean I'm not interacting\n\n1:21:17.140 --> 1:21:20.140\n with consciousness, it just means my interface gave up.\n\n1:21:20.140 --> 1:21:23.020\n And there's some deeper reality that we have to go after.\n\n1:21:23.020 --> 1:21:26.980\n So your question really forces out a big part\n\n1:21:26.980 --> 1:21:29.100\n of this whole approach that I'm talking about.\n\n1:21:29.100 --> 1:21:30.580\n So it's this portal and consciousness.\n\n1:21:30.580 --> 1:21:33.300\n I wonder why you can't,\n\n1:21:33.300 --> 1:21:35.940\n your portal is not as good to a cat,\n\n1:21:36.820 --> 1:21:40.420\n to a cat's consciousness than it is to a human.\n\n1:21:40.420 --> 1:21:43.700\n Does it have to do with the fact that you're human\n\n1:21:45.100 --> 1:21:49.820\n and just similar organisms, organisms of similar complexity\n\n1:21:49.820 --> 1:21:53.420\n are able to create portals better to each other?\n\n1:21:53.420 --> 1:21:55.620\n Or is it just as you get more and more complex,\n\n1:21:55.620 --> 1:21:57.860\n you get better and better portals?\n\n1:21:57.860 --> 1:22:00.220\n Well, let me answer one aspect of it\n\n1:22:00.220 --> 1:22:01.180\n that I'm more confident about,\n\n1:22:01.180 --> 1:22:03.540\n then I'll speculate on that.\n\n1:22:03.540 --> 1:22:07.180\n Why is it that the portal is so bad with protons?\n\n1:22:07.180 --> 1:22:09.500\n Well, and elementary particles more generally.\n\n1:22:09.500 --> 1:22:12.260\n So quarks, leptons and gluons and so forth.\n\n1:22:12.260 --> 1:22:16.100\n Well, the reason for that is because those are just\n\n1:22:16.100 --> 1:22:18.260\n symmetries of space time.\n\n1:22:19.220 --> 1:22:21.060\n More technically, they're irreducible representations\n\n1:22:21.060 --> 1:22:22.940\n of the Poincare group of space time.\n\n1:22:22.940 --> 1:22:26.940\n So they're just literally representations\n\n1:22:26.940 --> 1:22:30.940\n of the data structure of space time that we're using.\n\n1:22:30.940 --> 1:22:33.260\n So that's why they're not very much insightful.\n\n1:22:33.260 --> 1:22:35.700\n They're just almost entirely tied\n\n1:22:35.700 --> 1:22:37.020\n to the data structure itself.\n\n1:22:37.020 --> 1:22:38.940\n There's not much,\n\n1:22:38.940 --> 1:22:40.980\n they're telling you only something about the data structure,\n\n1:22:40.980 --> 1:22:42.420\n not behind the data structure.\n\n1:22:42.420 --> 1:22:44.180\n It's only when we get to higher levels\n\n1:22:44.180 --> 1:22:46.060\n that we're starting to, in some sense,\n\n1:22:46.060 --> 1:22:49.820\n build portals to what's behind space time.\n\n1:22:49.820 --> 1:22:50.660\n Sure.\n\n1:22:50.660 --> 1:22:55.660\n Yeah, so there's more and more complexity built\n\n1:22:55.940 --> 1:22:59.940\n on top of the interface of space time with the cat.\n\n1:22:59.940 --> 1:23:01.340\n So you can actually build a portal, right?\n\n1:23:01.340 --> 1:23:02.180\n Yeah.\n\n1:23:02.180 --> 1:23:04.020\n Yeah, right.\n\n1:23:06.700 --> 1:23:11.700\n Yeah, this interface of face and hair and so on, skin.\n\n1:23:14.820 --> 1:23:18.100\n There's some syncing going on between humans though,\n\n1:23:18.100 --> 1:23:21.100\n where we synced, like you're getting\n\n1:23:21.100 --> 1:23:24.500\n a pretty good representation of the ideas in my head\n\n1:23:24.500 --> 1:23:29.500\n and starting to get a foggy view of my memories in my head.\n\n1:23:30.700 --> 1:23:34.540\n Even though this is the first time we're talking,\n\n1:23:34.540 --> 1:23:36.860\n you start to project your own memories.\n\n1:23:36.860 --> 1:23:40.820\n You start to solve like a giant hierarchy of puzzles\n\n1:23:40.820 --> 1:23:43.700\n about a human, because we're all,\n\n1:23:43.700 --> 1:23:46.660\n there's a lot of similarities, a lot of it rhymes.\n\n1:23:46.660 --> 1:23:48.340\n So you start to make a lot of inferences\n\n1:23:48.340 --> 1:23:50.900\n and you build up this model of a person.\n\n1:23:50.900 --> 1:23:52.820\n You have a pretty sophisticated model\n\n1:23:52.820 --> 1:23:55.540\n what's going on underneath.\n\n1:23:55.540 --> 1:23:59.060\n Again, I just, I wonder if it's possible\n\n1:23:59.060 --> 1:24:00.980\n to construct these models about each other\n\n1:24:00.980 --> 1:24:05.540\n and nevertheless be very distant from an underlying reality.\n\n1:24:06.940 --> 1:24:08.260\n There's a lot of work on this.\n\n1:24:08.260 --> 1:24:10.460\n So there's some interesting work called signaling games\n\n1:24:10.460 --> 1:24:13.860\n where they look at how people can coordinate\n\n1:24:13.860 --> 1:24:17.340\n and come to communicate.\n\n1:24:17.340 --> 1:24:19.540\n There's some interesting work that was done\n\n1:24:19.540 --> 1:24:21.420\n by some colleagues and friends of mine,\n\n1:24:21.420 --> 1:24:26.420\n Louis Narens, Natalia Komarova, and Kimberly Jamieson,\n\n1:24:26.740 --> 1:24:31.740\n where they were looking at evolving color words.\n\n1:24:32.060 --> 1:24:36.020\n So you have a circle of colors, the color circle,\n\n1:24:36.020 --> 1:24:39.900\n and they wanted to see if they could get people to cooperate\n\n1:24:39.900 --> 1:24:43.300\n and how they carved the color circle up into a circle.\n\n1:24:43.300 --> 1:24:44.940\n Two units of words.\n\n1:24:45.940 --> 1:24:49.660\n And so they had a game theoretic kind of thing\n\n1:24:49.660 --> 1:24:50.700\n that they'd had people do.\n\n1:24:50.700 --> 1:24:52.940\n And what they found was that when they included,\n\n1:24:52.940 --> 1:24:54.940\n so most people are trichromats,\n\n1:24:54.940 --> 1:24:57.940\n you have three kinds of cone photoreceptors,\n\n1:24:57.940 --> 1:24:59.500\n but there are some, a lot of men,\n\n1:24:59.500 --> 1:25:01.460\n 7% of men are dichromats.\n\n1:25:01.460 --> 1:25:04.420\n They might be missing the red cone photoreceptor.\n\n1:25:04.420 --> 1:25:09.020\n They found that the dichromats had an outsized influence\n\n1:25:09.020 --> 1:25:12.580\n on the final ways that the whole space of colors\n\n1:25:12.580 --> 1:25:14.900\n was carved up and labels attached.\n\n1:25:14.900 --> 1:25:17.900\n You needed to be able to include the dichromats\n\n1:25:17.900 --> 1:25:18.860\n in the conversation.\n\n1:25:18.860 --> 1:25:20.140\n And so they had a bigger influence\n\n1:25:20.140 --> 1:25:23.020\n on how you made the boundaries of the language.\n\n1:25:23.020 --> 1:25:25.700\n And I thought that was a really interesting kind of insight\n\n1:25:25.700 --> 1:25:27.900\n that there's going to be, again, a game,\n\n1:25:27.900 --> 1:25:31.460\n perhaps a game where evolutionary or genetic algorithm\n\n1:25:31.460 --> 1:25:34.420\n kind of thing that goes on in terms of learning\n\n1:25:34.420 --> 1:25:37.900\n to communicate in ways that are useful.\n\n1:25:37.900 --> 1:25:41.020\n And so, yeah, you can use game theory to actually explore\n\n1:25:41.020 --> 1:25:42.580\n that are signaling games.\n\n1:25:42.580 --> 1:25:44.740\n There's a lot of brilliant work on that.\n\n1:25:44.740 --> 1:25:47.620\n I'm not doing it, but there's work out there.\n\n1:25:47.620 --> 1:25:50.820\n So if it's okay, let us tackle once more\n\n1:25:50.820 --> 1:25:52.620\n and perhaps several more times\n\n1:25:52.620 --> 1:25:55.580\n after the big topic of consciousness.\n\n1:25:55.580 --> 1:25:59.540\n Okay, this very beautiful, powerful things\n\n1:25:59.540 --> 1:26:03.100\n that perhaps is the thing that makes us human, what is it?\n\n1:26:03.100 --> 1:26:05.300\n What's the role of consciousness in,\n\n1:26:06.140 --> 1:26:08.140\n let's say even just the thing we've been talking about,\n\n1:26:08.140 --> 1:26:13.140\n which is the formation of this interface, any kind of ways\n\n1:26:13.820 --> 1:26:18.460\n you want to kind of start talking about it.\n\n1:26:18.460 --> 1:26:21.420\n Well, let me say first what most of my colleagues say.\n\n1:26:22.940 --> 1:26:27.620\n 99% are, again, assuming that space time is fundamental,\n\n1:26:27.620 --> 1:26:30.020\n particles and space time, matter is fundamental,\n\n1:26:30.900 --> 1:26:32.540\n and most are reductionist.\n\n1:26:33.740 --> 1:26:37.100\n And so the standard approach to consciousness\n\n1:26:37.100 --> 1:26:42.100\n is to figure out what complicated systems of matter\n\n1:26:43.900 --> 1:26:45.940\n with the right functional properties\n\n1:26:45.940 --> 1:26:48.540\n could possibly lead to the emergence of consciousness.\n\n1:26:48.540 --> 1:26:50.540\n That's the general idea, right?\n\n1:26:51.420 --> 1:26:53.900\n So maybe you have to have neurons,\n\n1:26:53.900 --> 1:26:58.620\n maybe only if you have neurons, but that might not be enough.\n\n1:26:58.620 --> 1:27:00.380\n They have to certain kinds of complexity\n\n1:27:00.380 --> 1:27:02.780\n in their organization and their dynamics,\n\n1:27:02.780 --> 1:27:05.140\n certain kind of network abilities, for example.\n\n1:27:05.140 --> 1:27:10.140\n So there are those who say, for example,\n\n1:27:10.820 --> 1:27:14.700\n that consciousness arises from orchestrated collapse\n\n1:27:14.700 --> 1:27:18.340\n of quantum states of microtubules and neurons, certainly.\n\n1:27:18.340 --> 1:27:22.460\n So this is Hamroff and Penrose, that's kind of.\n\n1:27:22.460 --> 1:27:25.460\n So you start with something physical,\n\n1:27:25.460 --> 1:27:28.620\n a property of quantum states of neurons,\n\n1:27:30.420 --> 1:27:32.180\n of microtubules and neurons,\n\n1:27:32.180 --> 1:27:34.860\n and you say that somehow an orchestrated collapse\n\n1:27:34.860 --> 1:27:38.740\n of those is consciousness or conscious experiences.\n\n1:27:38.740 --> 1:27:40.500\n Or integrated information theory.\n\n1:27:40.500 --> 1:27:42.620\n Again, you start with something physical,\n\n1:27:42.620 --> 1:27:44.940\n and if it has the right kind of functional properties,\n\n1:27:44.940 --> 1:27:46.300\n it's something they call phi,\n\n1:27:46.300 --> 1:27:48.060\n with the right kind of integrated information,\n\n1:27:48.060 --> 1:27:50.620\n then you have consciousness.\n\n1:27:50.620 --> 1:27:54.940\n Or you can be a panpsychist, Philip Goff, for example,\n\n1:27:54.940 --> 1:27:57.340\n where you might say, well,\n\n1:27:57.340 --> 1:28:01.340\n in addition to the particles and space and time,\n\n1:28:01.340 --> 1:28:03.420\n those particles are not just matter,\n\n1:28:03.420 --> 1:28:06.540\n they also could have, say, a unit of consciousness.\n\n1:28:06.540 --> 1:28:09.340\n And so, but once again, you're taking space and time\n\n1:28:09.340 --> 1:28:11.220\n and particles as fundamental,\n\n1:28:11.220 --> 1:28:14.100\n and you're adding a new property to them,\n\n1:28:14.100 --> 1:28:16.780\n say, consciousness, and then you have to talk about how\n\n1:28:16.780 --> 1:28:21.060\n when a proton and an electron get together\n\n1:28:21.060 --> 1:28:24.340\n to form hydrogen, then how those consciousnesses\n\n1:28:24.340 --> 1:28:27.340\n merge to or interact to create the consciousness\n\n1:28:27.340 --> 1:28:29.020\n of hydrogen and so forth.\n\n1:28:30.340 --> 1:28:31.540\n There's attention schema theory,\n\n1:28:31.540 --> 1:28:35.780\n which again, this is how neural network processes\n\n1:28:35.780 --> 1:28:38.340\n representing to the network itself,\n\n1:28:38.340 --> 1:28:41.820\n its attentional processes, that could be consciousness.\n\n1:28:42.820 --> 1:28:44.340\n There's global workspace theory,\n\n1:28:45.500 --> 1:28:48.420\n and neuronal global workspace theory.\n\n1:28:48.420 --> 1:28:50.420\n So there's many, many theories of this type.\n\n1:28:50.420 --> 1:28:53.900\n What's common to all of them is they assume\n\n1:28:53.900 --> 1:28:56.220\n that space time is fundamental.\n\n1:28:56.220 --> 1:28:57.940\n They assume that physical processes\n\n1:28:57.940 --> 1:28:59.620\n and space time is fundamental.\n\n1:28:59.620 --> 1:29:02.540\n Panpsychism adds consciousness as an additional thing,\n\n1:29:02.540 --> 1:29:04.620\n it's almost dualist in that regard.\n\n1:29:05.940 --> 1:29:10.940\n And my attitude is our best science is telling us\n\n1:29:11.220 --> 1:29:13.300\n that space time is not fundamental.\n\n1:29:13.300 --> 1:29:17.100\n So why is that important here?\n\n1:29:17.100 --> 1:29:22.100\n Well, for centuries, deep thinkers thought of earth, air,\n\n1:29:23.100 --> 1:29:26.260\n fire, and water as the fundamental elements.\n\n1:29:26.260 --> 1:29:28.580\n It was a reductionist kind of idea.\n\n1:29:28.580 --> 1:29:30.100\n Nothing was more elemental than those,\n\n1:29:30.100 --> 1:29:33.460\n and you could sort of build everything up from those.\n\n1:29:33.460 --> 1:29:36.180\n When we got the periodic table of elements,\n\n1:29:37.180 --> 1:29:40.020\n we realized that, of course,\n\n1:29:40.020 --> 1:29:42.020\n we want to study earth, air, fire, and water.\n\n1:29:42.020 --> 1:29:44.060\n There's combustion science for fire.\n\n1:29:44.060 --> 1:29:49.020\n There's sciences for all these other things,\n\n1:29:49.020 --> 1:29:50.300\n water and so forth.\n\n1:29:50.300 --> 1:29:51.900\n So we're gonna do science with these things,\n\n1:29:51.900 --> 1:29:54.180\n but fundamental, no, no.\n\n1:29:54.180 --> 1:29:56.180\n If you're looking for something fundamental,\n\n1:29:56.180 --> 1:29:58.500\n those are the wrong building blocks.\n\n1:29:58.500 --> 1:30:02.180\n Earth has many, many different kinds of elements\n\n1:30:02.180 --> 1:30:04.660\n that project into the one thing that we call earth.\n\n1:30:04.660 --> 1:30:06.820\n If you don't understand that there's silicon,\n\n1:30:06.820 --> 1:30:07.660\n that there's iron,\n\n1:30:07.660 --> 1:30:09.020\n that there's all these different kinds of things\n\n1:30:09.020 --> 1:30:11.260\n that project into what we call earth,\n\n1:30:11.260 --> 1:30:14.700\n you're hopelessly lost.\n\n1:30:14.700 --> 1:30:17.020\n You're not fundamental, you're not gonna get there.\n\n1:30:17.020 --> 1:30:19.820\n And then after the periodic table,\n\n1:30:19.820 --> 1:30:22.260\n then we came up with quarks, leptons, and gluons,\n\n1:30:22.260 --> 1:30:26.500\n the particles of the standard model of physics.\n\n1:30:26.500 --> 1:30:29.060\n And so we actually now know\n\n1:30:29.060 --> 1:30:31.220\n that if you really want to get fundamental,\n\n1:30:33.380 --> 1:30:34.660\n the periodic table isn't it.\n\n1:30:34.660 --> 1:30:35.660\n It's good for chemistry,\n\n1:30:35.660 --> 1:30:37.220\n and it's just wonderful for chemistry,\n\n1:30:37.220 --> 1:30:39.860\n but if you're trying to go deep fundamental,\n\n1:30:39.860 --> 1:30:41.500\n what is the fundamental science?\n\n1:30:41.500 --> 1:30:42.340\n That's not it.\n\n1:30:42.340 --> 1:30:44.580\n You're gonna have to go to quarks, leptons,\n\n1:30:44.580 --> 1:30:46.100\n and gluons and so forth.\n\n1:30:46.100 --> 1:30:51.100\n Well, now we've discovered space time itself is doomed.\n\n1:30:51.660 --> 1:30:53.020\n Quarks, leptons, and gluons\n\n1:30:53.020 --> 1:30:54.980\n are just irreducible representations\n\n1:30:54.980 --> 1:30:56.580\n of the symmetries of space time.\n\n1:30:57.540 --> 1:31:00.300\n So the whole framework\n\n1:31:00.300 --> 1:31:03.860\n on which consciousness research is being based right now\n\n1:31:03.860 --> 1:31:05.460\n is doomed.\n\n1:31:05.460 --> 1:31:09.220\n And for me, these are my friends and colleagues\n\n1:31:09.220 --> 1:31:11.020\n that are doing this, they're brilliant.\n\n1:31:11.020 --> 1:31:13.060\n They're absolutely, they're brilliant.\n\n1:31:13.060 --> 1:31:17.780\n I, my feeling is I'm so sad\n\n1:31:19.260 --> 1:31:21.780\n that they're stuck with this old framework\n\n1:31:21.780 --> 1:31:25.100\n because if they weren't stuck with earth, air, fire,\n\n1:31:25.100 --> 1:31:27.180\n and water, you could actually make progress.\n\n1:31:27.180 --> 1:31:28.740\n So it doesn't matter how smart you are.\n\n1:31:28.740 --> 1:31:30.260\n If you start with earth, air, fire, and water,\n\n1:31:30.260 --> 1:31:32.020\n you're not gonna get anywhere, right?\n\n1:31:32.020 --> 1:31:33.860\n Can I actually just,\n\n1:31:33.860 --> 1:31:36.060\n because the word doomed is so interesting,\n\n1:31:36.060 --> 1:31:39.260\n let me give you some options, multiple choice quiz.\n\n1:31:40.460 --> 1:31:43.220\n Is space time, we could say is reality\n\n1:31:43.220 --> 1:31:46.500\n the way we perceive it doomed,\n\n1:31:46.500 --> 1:31:51.500\n wrong or fake?\n\n1:31:54.180 --> 1:31:59.180\n Because doomed just means it could still be right\n\n1:31:59.300 --> 1:32:02.700\n and we're now ready to go deeper.\n\n1:32:02.700 --> 1:32:03.860\n It would be that.\n\n1:32:03.860 --> 1:32:08.340\n So it's not wrong, it's not a complete deviation\n\n1:32:08.340 --> 1:32:10.620\n from a journey toward the truth.\n\n1:32:10.620 --> 1:32:13.860\n Right, it's like earth, air, fire, and water is not wrong.\n\n1:32:13.860 --> 1:32:15.700\n There is earth, air, fire, and water.\n\n1:32:15.700 --> 1:32:19.060\n That's a useful framework, but it's not fundamental.\n\n1:32:19.060 --> 1:32:20.820\n Right, well, there's also wrong,\n\n1:32:20.820 --> 1:32:24.460\n which is they used to believe, as I recently learned,\n\n1:32:24.460 --> 1:32:27.300\n that George Washington was the president,\n\n1:32:27.300 --> 1:32:28.740\n the first president of the United States,\n\n1:32:28.740 --> 1:32:31.460\n was bled to death for something\n\n1:32:31.460 --> 1:32:34.020\n that could have been easily treated\n\n1:32:34.020 --> 1:32:36.380\n because it was believed that you can get,\n\n1:32:36.380 --> 1:32:38.120\n actually, I need to look into this further,\n\n1:32:38.120 --> 1:32:40.820\n but I guess you get toxins out or demons out.\n\n1:32:40.820 --> 1:32:41.860\n I don't know what you're getting out\n\n1:32:41.860 --> 1:32:43.540\n with the bleeding of a person.\n\n1:32:43.540 --> 1:32:47.140\n So that ended up being wrong,\n\n1:32:47.140 --> 1:32:50.740\n but widely believed as a medical tool.\n\n1:32:50.740 --> 1:32:55.740\n So it's also possible that our assumption of space time\n\n1:32:55.900 --> 1:32:58.940\n is not just doomed, but is wrong.\n\n1:32:58.940 --> 1:33:02.200\n Well, if we believe that it's fundamental, that's wrong.\n\n1:33:02.200 --> 1:33:05.320\n But if we believe it's a useful tool, that's right.\n\n1:33:05.320 --> 1:33:08.140\n But bleeding somebody to death\n\n1:33:08.140 --> 1:33:10.100\n was believed to be a useful tool.\n\n1:33:10.100 --> 1:33:11.140\n And that was wrong.\n\n1:33:11.140 --> 1:33:13.820\n It wasn't just not fundamental.\n\n1:33:13.820 --> 1:33:17.260\n It was very, I'm sure there's cases\n\n1:33:17.260 --> 1:33:19.020\n in which bleeding somebody would work,\n\n1:33:19.020 --> 1:33:23.540\n but it would be a very tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of cases.\n\n1:33:23.540 --> 1:33:25.820\n So it could be that it's wrong,\n\n1:33:25.820 --> 1:33:29.140\n like it's a side road that's ultimately leading\n\n1:33:29.140 --> 1:33:32.600\n to a dead end as opposed to a truck stop or something\n\n1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:34.700\n that you can get off of.\n\n1:33:34.700 --> 1:33:37.340\n My feeling is not the dead end kind of thing.\n\n1:33:37.340 --> 1:33:39.460\n I think that what the physicists are finding\n\n1:33:39.460 --> 1:33:41.700\n is that there are these structures beyond space time,\n\n1:33:41.700 --> 1:33:44.260\n but they project back into space time.\n\n1:33:44.260 --> 1:33:48.220\n And so space time, when they say space time is doomed,\n\n1:33:48.220 --> 1:33:49.100\n they're explicit.\n\n1:33:49.100 --> 1:33:50.420\n They're saying it's doomed in the sense\n\n1:33:50.420 --> 1:33:51.780\n that we thought it was fundamental.\n\n1:33:51.780 --> 1:33:53.220\n It's not fundamental.\n\n1:33:53.220 --> 1:33:57.460\n It's a useful, absolutely useful and brilliant data structure,\n\n1:33:57.460 --> 1:33:59.500\n but there are deeper data structures\n\n1:33:59.500 --> 1:34:03.980\n like cosmological polytope and space time is not fundamental.\n\n1:34:03.980 --> 1:34:07.620\n What is doomed in the sense that it's wrong\n\n1:34:07.620 --> 1:34:10.580\n is reductionism.\n\n1:34:10.580 --> 1:34:14.020\n Which is saying space time is fundamental, essentially.\n\n1:34:14.020 --> 1:34:14.940\n Right, right.\n\n1:34:14.940 --> 1:34:19.940\n The idea that somehow being smaller in space and time\n\n1:34:20.380 --> 1:34:23.900\n or space time is a fundamental nature of reality,\n\n1:34:23.900 --> 1:34:26.160\n that's just wrong.\n\n1:34:26.160 --> 1:34:28.220\n It turned out to be a useful heuristic\n\n1:34:28.220 --> 1:34:29.900\n for thermodynamics and so forth.\n\n1:34:29.900 --> 1:34:31.300\n And in several other places,\n\n1:34:31.300 --> 1:34:33.200\n reductionism has been very useful,\n\n1:34:33.200 --> 1:34:36.220\n but that's in some sense an artifact\n\n1:34:36.220 --> 1:34:38.100\n of how we use our interface.\n\n1:34:39.420 --> 1:34:41.620\n Yeah, so you're saying size doesn't matter.\n\n1:34:41.620 --> 1:34:44.580\n Okay, this is very important for me to write down.\n\n1:34:44.580 --> 1:34:46.300\n Ultimately. Ultimately, right.\n\n1:34:46.300 --> 1:34:49.740\n It's useful for theories like thermodynamics\n\n1:34:49.740 --> 1:34:51.460\n and also for understanding brain networks\n\n1:34:51.460 --> 1:34:54.420\n in terms of individual neurons and neurons\n\n1:34:54.420 --> 1:34:58.500\n in terms of chemical systems inside cells.\n\n1:34:58.500 --> 1:35:00.340\n That's all very, very useful,\n\n1:35:00.340 --> 1:35:02.380\n but the idea that we're getting\n\n1:35:02.380 --> 1:35:05.900\n to the more fundamental nature of reality, no.\n\n1:35:05.900 --> 1:35:08.260\n When you get all the way down in that direction,\n\n1:35:08.260 --> 1:35:09.980\n you get down to the quarks and gluons,\n\n1:35:09.980 --> 1:35:11.860\n what you realize is what you've gotten down to\n\n1:35:11.860 --> 1:35:13.300\n is not fundamental reality,\n\n1:35:13.300 --> 1:35:16.420\n just the irreducible representations of a data structure.\n\n1:35:16.420 --> 1:35:17.780\n That's all you've gotten down to.\n\n1:35:17.780 --> 1:35:21.660\n So you're always stuck inside the data structure.\n\n1:35:21.660 --> 1:35:23.620\n So you seem to be getting closer and closer.\n\n1:35:23.620 --> 1:35:25.660\n I went from neural networks to neurons,\n\n1:35:25.660 --> 1:35:27.680\n neurons to chemistry, chemistry to particles,\n\n1:35:27.680 --> 1:35:29.980\n particles to quarks and gluons.\n\n1:35:29.980 --> 1:35:31.500\n I'm getting closer and closer to the real.\n\n1:35:31.500 --> 1:35:34.300\n No, I'm getting closer and closer to the actual structure\n\n1:35:34.300 --> 1:35:36.660\n of the data structure of space and time,\n\n1:35:36.660 --> 1:35:38.220\n the irreducible representations.\n\n1:35:38.220 --> 1:35:39.680\n That's what you're getting closer to,\n\n1:35:39.680 --> 1:35:43.180\n not to a deeper understanding of what's beyond space time.\n\n1:35:43.180 --> 1:35:46.300\n We'll also refer, we'll return again\n\n1:35:46.300 --> 1:35:48.060\n to this question of dynamics\n\n1:35:48.060 --> 1:35:51.860\n because you keep saying that space time is doomed,\n\n1:35:51.860 --> 1:35:54.420\n but mostly focusing on the space part of that.\n\n1:35:54.420 --> 1:35:59.020\n It's very interesting to see why time gets the bad cred too\n\n1:35:59.020 --> 1:36:01.060\n because how do you have dynamics without time\n\n1:36:01.060 --> 1:36:02.940\n is the thing I'd love to talk to you a little bit about.\n\n1:36:02.940 --> 1:36:07.940\n But let us return your brilliant whirlwind overview\n\n1:36:09.380 --> 1:36:11.440\n of the different theories of consciousness\n\n1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:12.500\n that are out there.\n\n1:36:14.420 --> 1:36:18.760\n What is consciousness if outside of space time?\n\n1:36:18.760 --> 1:36:20.860\n If we think that we want to have a model of consciousness,\n\n1:36:20.860 --> 1:36:23.940\n we as scientists then have to say,\n\n1:36:23.940 --> 1:36:25.140\n what do we want to write down?\n\n1:36:25.140 --> 1:36:26.940\n What kind of mathematical modeling\n\n1:36:26.940 --> 1:36:28.700\n are we gonna write down, right?\n\n1:36:28.700 --> 1:36:30.180\n And if you think about it, there's lots of things\n\n1:36:30.180 --> 1:36:32.580\n that you might want to write down about consciousness.\n\n1:36:32.580 --> 1:36:34.180\n For all the complicated subject.\n\n1:36:35.620 --> 1:36:36.880\n So most of my colleagues are saying,\n\n1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:38.380\n let's start with matter or neurons\n\n1:36:38.380 --> 1:36:40.940\n and see what properties of matter\n\n1:36:40.940 --> 1:36:42.500\n could create consciousness.\n\n1:36:42.500 --> 1:36:45.200\n But I'm saying that that whole thing is out.\n\n1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:47.740\n Space time is doomed, that whole thing is out.\n\n1:36:47.740 --> 1:36:51.420\n We need to look at consciousness qua consciousness.\n\n1:36:51.420 --> 1:36:53.300\n In other words, not as something that arises\n\n1:36:53.300 --> 1:36:55.220\n in space and time, but perhaps as something\n\n1:36:55.220 --> 1:36:58.260\n that creates space and time as a data structure.\n\n1:36:58.260 --> 1:36:59.440\n So what do we want?\n\n1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:02.020\n And here again, there's no hard and fast rule,\n\n1:37:02.020 --> 1:37:03.820\n but what you as a scientist have to do\n\n1:37:03.820 --> 1:37:08.820\n is to pick what you think are the minimal assumptions\n\n1:37:09.740 --> 1:37:13.740\n that are gonna allow you to boot up a comprehensive theory.\n\n1:37:13.740 --> 1:37:15.120\n That is the trick.\n\n1:37:16.420 --> 1:37:17.360\n So what do I want?\n\n1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:20.780\n So what I chose to do was to have three things.\n\n1:37:23.060 --> 1:37:25.260\n I said that there are conscious experiences.\n\n1:37:26.260 --> 1:37:28.960\n Feeling of headache, the smell of garlic,\n\n1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:32.240\n experiencing the color red.\n\n1:37:32.240 --> 1:37:33.640\n There are, those are conscious,\n\n1:37:33.640 --> 1:37:34.880\n so that's the primitive of the theory.\n\n1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:36.820\n And the reason I want few primitives, why?\n\n1:37:36.820 --> 1:37:38.800\n Because those are the miracles of the theory, right?\n\n1:37:38.800 --> 1:37:40.720\n The primitives, the assumptions of the theory\n\n1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:42.400\n are the things you're not going to explain.\n\n1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:43.980\n Those are the things you assume.\n\n1:37:43.980 --> 1:37:46.320\n And those experiences, you particularly mean\n\n1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:49.600\n there's a subjectiveness to them.\n\n1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:51.680\n That's the thing when people refer\n\n1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:54.040\n to the hard problem of consciousness,\n\n1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:58.160\n is it feels like something to look at the color red, okay.\n\n1:37:58.160 --> 1:38:00.400\n Exactly right, it feels like something to have a headache\n\n1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:02.760\n or to feel upset to your stomach.\n\n1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:04.520\n It feels like something.\n\n1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:09.520\n And so I'm going to grant that in this theory,\n\n1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:12.480\n there are experiences and they're fundamental in some sense.\n\n1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:13.840\n So conscious experience.\n\n1:38:13.840 --> 1:38:15.720\n So they're not derived from physics.\n\n1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:18.780\n They're not functional properties of particles.\n\n1:38:18.780 --> 1:38:21.800\n They are sui generis, they exist.\n\n1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:23.760\n Just like we assume space time exists.\n\n1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:26.320\n I'm now saying space time is just a data structure.\n\n1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:29.520\n It doesn't exist independent of conscious experiences.\n\n1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:30.800\n Sorry to interrupt once again,\n\n1:38:30.800 --> 1:38:34.500\n but should we be focusing in your thinking on humans alone?\n\n1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:40.640\n Or is there something about in relation\n\n1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:42.560\n to other kinds of organisms that have\n\n1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:44.640\n a sufficiently high level of complexity?\n\n1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:49.640\n Or even, or is there some kind of generalization\n\n1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:54.380\n of the panpsychist idea that all consciousness permeates,\n\n1:38:54.380 --> 1:38:55.760\n all matter?\n\n1:38:55.760 --> 1:38:58.720\n Outside of the usual definition\n\n1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:01.220\n of what matter is inside space time.\n\n1:39:01.220 --> 1:39:04.320\n So it's beyond human consciousness.\n\n1:39:04.320 --> 1:39:06.380\n Human consciousness, from my point of view,\n\n1:39:06.380 --> 1:39:10.520\n would be one of a countless variety of consciousnesses.\n\n1:39:10.520 --> 1:39:12.400\n And even within human consciousness,\n\n1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:15.840\n there's countless variety of consciousnesses within us.\n\n1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:18.460\n I mean, you have your left and right hemisphere.\n\n1:39:18.460 --> 1:39:20.760\n And apparently if you split the corpus callosum,\n\n1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:22.800\n the personality of the left hemisphere\n\n1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:24.400\n and the religious beliefs of the left hemisphere\n\n1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:26.400\n can be very different from the right hemisphere.\n\n1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:30.680\n And their conscious experiences can be disjoint.\n\n1:39:30.680 --> 1:39:32.520\n One could have one conscious experience.\n\n1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:33.880\n They can play 20 questions.\n\n1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:35.880\n The left hemisphere can have an idea in its mind\n\n1:39:35.880 --> 1:39:37.400\n and the right hemisphere has to guess.\n\n1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:38.920\n And it might not get it.\n\n1:39:38.920 --> 1:39:40.700\n So even within you,\n\n1:39:40.700 --> 1:39:43.080\n there is more than just one consciousness.\n\n1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:45.240\n It's lots of consciousnesses.\n\n1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:48.720\n So the general theory of consciousness that I'm after\n\n1:39:48.720 --> 1:39:50.380\n is not just human consciousness.\n\n1:39:50.380 --> 1:39:51.940\n It's going to be just consciousness.\n\n1:39:51.940 --> 1:39:56.720\n And I presume human consciousness is a tiny drop\n\n1:39:56.720 --> 1:39:59.320\n in the bucket of the infinite variety of consciousnesses.\n\n1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:02.680\n That said, I should clarify that the black hole\n\n1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:07.400\n of consciousness is the home cat.\n\n1:40:07.400 --> 1:40:11.840\n I'm pretty sure cats lack, is the embodiment of evil\n\n1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:16.000\n and lack all capacity for consciousness or compassion.\n\n1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:17.120\n So I just want to lay that on the table.\n\n1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:17.960\n That's the theory I'm working on.\n\n1:40:17.960 --> 1:40:20.880\n I don't have any good evidence, but it's just an intuition.\n\n1:40:20.880 --> 1:40:22.080\n It's just a shout out.\n\n1:40:23.480 --> 1:40:24.320\n Sorry to distract.\n\n1:40:24.320 --> 1:40:25.720\n So that's the first assumption.\n\n1:40:25.720 --> 1:40:27.200\n The first assumption, that's right.\n\n1:40:27.200 --> 1:40:29.200\n The second assumption is that\n\n1:40:29.200 --> 1:40:31.680\n these experiences have consequences.\n\n1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:35.040\n So I'm going to say that conscious experiences\n\n1:40:35.040 --> 1:40:37.400\n can trigger other conscious experiences somehow.\n\n1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:43.360\n So really in some sense, there's two basic assumptions.\n\n1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:46.200\n There's some kind of causality.\n\n1:40:46.200 --> 1:40:47.800\n Is there a chain of causality?\n\n1:40:47.800 --> 1:40:50.320\n Does this relate to dynamics?\n\n1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:52.560\n I'll say there's a probabilistic relationship.\n\n1:40:55.040 --> 1:40:58.840\n So I'm trying to be as nonspecific to begin with\n\n1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:01.080\n and see where it leads me.\n\n1:41:01.080 --> 1:41:04.000\n So what I can write down are probability spaces.\n\n1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.640\n So a probability space, which contains\n\n1:41:06.640 --> 1:41:09.560\n the conscious experiences that this consciousness can have.\n\n1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:14.560\n So I call this a conscious agent, this technical thing.\n\n1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:19.320\n Annika Harris and I've talked about this\n\n1:41:19.320 --> 1:41:22.880\n and she rightly cautions me that people will think\n\n1:41:22.880 --> 1:41:25.120\n that I'm bringing in a notion of a self or agency\n\n1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:27.440\n and so forth when I say conscious agent.\n\n1:41:27.440 --> 1:41:30.000\n So I just want to say that I use the term conscious agent\n\n1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.280\n merely as a technical term.\n\n1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:35.640\n There is no notion of self in my fundamental definition\n\n1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:36.640\n of a conscious agent.\n\n1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:41.080\n There are only experiences and probabilistic relationships\n\n1:41:41.080 --> 1:41:43.000\n of how they trigger other experiences.\n\n1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.280\n So the agent is the generator of the conscious experience?\n\n1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:49.560\n The agent is a mathematical structure\n\n1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:51.920\n that includes a probability measure,\n\n1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:56.080\n the probability space of a possible conscious experiences\n\n1:41:56.080 --> 1:42:00.080\n and a Markovian kernel, which describes how\n\n1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:02.800\n if this agent has certain conscious experiences,\n\n1:42:02.800 --> 1:42:04.280\n how that will affect the experiences\n\n1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:07.520\n of other conscious agents, including itself.\n\n1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:09.920\n But you don't think of that as a self?\n\n1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:13.720\n No, there is no notion of a self here.\n\n1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:16.560\n There's no notion of really of an agent.\n\n1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:19.120\n But is there a locality?\n\n1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:21.160\n Is there an organism?\n\n1:42:21.160 --> 1:42:22.000\n There's no space.\n\n1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:22.880\n There's no.\n\n1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:27.880\n So this is, these are conscious units, conscious entities.\n\n1:42:28.280 --> 1:42:30.440\n But they're distinct in some way\n\n1:42:30.440 --> 1:42:32.280\n because they have to interact.\n\n1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:33.640\n Well, so here's the interesting thing.\n\n1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:36.080\n When we write down the mathematics,\n\n1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:39.280\n when you have two of these conscious agents interacting,\n\n1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:43.720\n the pair satisfy a definition of a conscious agent.\n\n1:42:43.720 --> 1:42:46.160\n So they are a single conscious agent.\n\n1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:48.520\n So there is one conscious agent.\n\n1:42:48.520 --> 1:42:52.360\n But it has a nice analytic decomposition\n\n1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:53.200\n into as many conscious agents as you wish.\n\n1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:55.520\n So that's a nice interface.\n\n1:42:55.520 --> 1:42:58.720\n It's a very useful scientific interface.\n\n1:42:58.720 --> 1:43:03.200\n It's a scale free or if you like a fractal like approach\n\n1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:06.320\n to it in which we can use the same unit of analysis\n\n1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:09.760\n at all scales in studying consciousness.\n\n1:43:09.760 --> 1:43:12.240\n But if I want to talk about,\n\n1:43:12.240 --> 1:43:17.160\n so there's no notion of learning, memory, problem solving,\n\n1:43:17.160 --> 1:43:20.800\n intelligence, self, agency.\n\n1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:22.320\n So none of that is fundamental.\n\n1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:26.360\n So, and the reason I did that was\n\n1:43:26.360 --> 1:43:29.880\n because I want to assume as little as possible.\n\n1:43:29.880 --> 1:43:32.160\n Everything I assume is a miracle in the theory.\n\n1:43:32.160 --> 1:43:34.520\n It's not something you explain, it's something you assume.\n\n1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:37.400\n So I have to build networks of conscious agents.\n\n1:43:38.760 --> 1:43:40.000\n If I want to have a notion of a self,\n\n1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:41.520\n I have to build a self.\n\n1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:43.920\n I have to build learning, memory, problem solving,\n\n1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:46.720\n intelligence and planning, all these different things.\n\n1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:49.480\n I have to build networks of conscious agents to do that.\n\n1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:52.400\n It's a trivial theorem that networks of conscious agents\n\n1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:54.680\n are computationally universal, that's trivial.\n\n1:43:54.680 --> 1:43:56.800\n So anything that we can do with neural networks\n\n1:43:56.800 --> 1:44:00.480\n or automata, you can do with networks of conscious agents.\n\n1:44:00.480 --> 1:44:01.320\n That's trivial.\n\n1:44:01.320 --> 1:44:04.320\n But you can also do more.\n\n1:44:04.320 --> 1:44:08.200\n The events in the probability space need not be computable.\n\n1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:11.800\n So the Markovian dynamics is not restricted\n\n1:44:11.800 --> 1:44:14.440\n to computable functions\n\n1:44:14.440 --> 1:44:17.280\n because the very events themselves need not be computable.\n\n1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:20.640\n So this can capture any computable theory.\n\n1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:22.000\n Anything we can do with neural networks,\n\n1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:24.640\n we can do with conscious agent networks.\n\n1:44:24.640 --> 1:44:27.520\n But it leaves open the door for the possibility\n\n1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:31.960\n of noncomputable interactions between conscious agents.\n\n1:44:31.960 --> 1:44:36.960\n So if we want a theory of memory, we have to build it.\n\n1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:39.080\n And there's lots of different ways you could build.\n\n1:44:39.080 --> 1:44:40.000\n We've actually got a paper,\n\n1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:41.720\n Chris Fields took the lead on this.\n\n1:44:41.720 --> 1:44:44.640\n And we have a paper called Conscious Agent Networks\n\n1:44:44.640 --> 1:44:47.160\n where Chris takes the lead and shows how to use\n\n1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:49.080\n these networks of conscious agents to build memory\n\n1:44:49.080 --> 1:44:52.280\n and to build primitive kinds of learning.\n\n1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:56.160\n But can you provide some intuition\n\n1:44:56.160 --> 1:44:58.880\n of what conscious networks,\n\n1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:03.880\n networks of conscious agents helps you?\n\n1:45:04.080 --> 1:45:05.840\n First of all, what that looks like.\n\n1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:08.920\n And I don't just mean mathematically.\n\n1:45:08.920 --> 1:45:11.600\n Of course, maybe that might help build up intuition.\n\n1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:14.000\n But how that helps us potentially solve\n\n1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:15.640\n the hard problem of consciousness.\n\n1:45:17.680 --> 1:45:21.640\n Or is that baked in, that that exists?\n\n1:45:21.640 --> 1:45:26.640\n Can you solve the hard problem of consciousness,\n\n1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:30.360\n why it tastes delicious when you eat a delicious ice cream\n\n1:45:31.640 --> 1:45:33.840\n with networks of conscious agents?\n\n1:45:33.840 --> 1:45:36.040\n Or is that taken as an assumption?\n\n1:45:36.040 --> 1:45:40.080\n So the standard way the hard problem is thought of\n\n1:45:40.080 --> 1:45:44.600\n is we're assuming space and time and particles\n\n1:45:44.600 --> 1:45:46.000\n or neurons, for example.\n\n1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:50.000\n These are just physical things that have no consciousness.\n\n1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:51.760\n And we have to explain how the conscious experience\n\n1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:54.920\n of the taste of chocolate could emerge from those.\n\n1:45:54.920 --> 1:45:57.080\n So the typical hard problem of consciousness\n\n1:45:57.080 --> 1:45:58.720\n is that problem, right?\n\n1:45:58.720 --> 1:46:02.040\n How do you boot up the taste of chocolate,\n\n1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:06.280\n the experience of the taste of chocolate from neurons, say,\n\n1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:10.560\n or the right kind of artificial intelligence circuitry?\n\n1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:11.640\n How do you boot that up?\n\n1:46:11.640 --> 1:46:14.320\n That's typically what the hard problem of consciousness\n\n1:46:14.320 --> 1:46:15.800\n means to researchers.\n\n1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:18.360\n Notice that I'm changing the problem.\n\n1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:21.360\n I'm not trying to boot up conscious experiences\n\n1:46:21.360 --> 1:46:23.800\n from the dynamics of neurons or silicon\n\n1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:25.000\n or something like that.\n\n1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:27.840\n I'm saying that that's the wrong problem.\n\n1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:29.920\n My hard problem would go in the other direction.\n\n1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:33.480\n If I start with conscious experiences,\n\n1:46:33.480 --> 1:46:35.640\n how do I build up space and time?\n\n1:46:35.640 --> 1:46:37.560\n How do I build up what I call the physical world?\n\n1:46:37.560 --> 1:46:39.560\n How do I build up what we call brains?\n\n1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:43.080\n Because I'm saying consciousness\n\n1:46:43.080 --> 1:46:45.640\n is not something that brains do.\n\n1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:49.440\n Brains are something that consciousness makes up.\n\n1:46:49.440 --> 1:46:50.840\n It's among the experience,\n\n1:46:50.840 --> 1:46:54.560\n it's an ephemeral experience in consciousness.\n\n1:46:54.560 --> 1:46:57.040\n I look inside, so to be very, very clear,\n\n1:46:57.040 --> 1:46:58.760\n right now, I have no neurons.\n\n1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:03.200\n If you looked, you would see neurons.\n\n1:47:03.200 --> 1:47:05.320\n That's a data structure that you would create on the fly,\n\n1:47:05.320 --> 1:47:06.440\n and it's a very useful one.\n\n1:47:06.440 --> 1:47:08.560\n As soon as you look away,\n\n1:47:08.560 --> 1:47:10.000\n you garbage collect that data structure,\n\n1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:11.800\n just like that Necker cube that I was talking about\n\n1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:12.960\n on the piece of paper.\n\n1:47:12.960 --> 1:47:17.360\n When you look, you see a 3D cube you created on the fly.\n\n1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:19.600\n As soon as you look away, that's gone.\n\n1:47:19.600 --> 1:47:22.920\n When you say you, you mean a human being scientist.\n\n1:47:22.920 --> 1:47:24.600\n Right now, that's right.\n\n1:47:24.600 --> 1:47:26.960\n More generally, it'll be conscious agents,\n\n1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:28.400\n because as you pointed out,\n\n1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:30.920\n am I asking for a theory of consciousness\n\n1:47:30.920 --> 1:47:31.760\n only about humans?\n\n1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:33.920\n No, it's consciousness,\n\n1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:38.240\n which human consciousness is just a tiny sliver.\n\n1:47:38.240 --> 1:47:40.160\n But you are saying that there is,\n\n1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:41.840\n that's a useful data structure.\n\n1:47:41.840 --> 1:47:43.760\n How many other data structures are there?\n\n1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:45.480\n That's why I said you human.\n\n1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:47.480\n If there's another Earth,\n\n1:47:47.480 --> 1:47:49.640\n if there's another alien civilization\n\n1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:51.640\n and doing these kinds of investigations,\n\n1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:54.280\n would they come up with similar data structures?\n\n1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:55.120\n Probably not.\n\n1:47:55.120 --> 1:47:56.560\n What is the space of data structures,\n\n1:47:56.560 --> 1:47:57.960\n I guess is what I'm asking.\n\n1:48:00.200 --> 1:48:04.000\n My guess is that if consciousness is fundamental,\n\n1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:05.560\n consciousness is all there is,\n\n1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:10.440\n then the only thing that mathematical structure\n\n1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:13.080\n can be about is possibilities of consciousness.\n\n1:48:15.600 --> 1:48:17.880\n And that suggests to me\n\n1:48:17.880 --> 1:48:21.280\n that there could be an infinite variety of consciousnesses,\n\n1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:25.120\n and a vanishingly small fraction of them\n\n1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:27.800\n use space time data structures\n\n1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:29.520\n and the kinds of structures that we use.\n\n1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:32.040\n There's an infinite variety of data structures.\n\n1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:33.120\n Now, this is very similar\n\n1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:35.000\n to something that Max Tegmark has said,\n\n1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:36.040\n but I want to distinguish it.\n\n1:48:36.040 --> 1:48:40.440\n He has this level four multiverse idea.\n\n1:48:40.440 --> 1:48:43.040\n He thinks that mathematics is fundamental.\n\n1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:45.000\n And so that's the fundamental reality.\n\n1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.360\n And since there's an infinite variety of,\n\n1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:49.000\n endless variety of mathematical structures,\n\n1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:52.560\n there's an infinite variety of multiverses in his view.\n\n1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:55.280\n I'm saying something similar in spirit,\n\n1:48:55.280 --> 1:48:56.960\n but importantly different.\n\n1:48:56.960 --> 1:48:57.800\n There's an infinite variety\n\n1:48:57.800 --> 1:48:59.720\n of mathematical structures, absolutely.\n\n1:49:00.760 --> 1:49:03.160\n But mathematics isn't the fundamental reality\n\n1:49:03.160 --> 1:49:04.960\n in this framework.\n\n1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:06.680\n Consciousness is,\n\n1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:09.360\n and mathematics is to consciousness\n\n1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:12.000\n like bones are to an organism.\n\n1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:12.880\n You need the bones.\n\n1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:16.480\n So mathematics is not divorced from consciousness,\n\n1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:20.280\n but it's not the entirety of consciousness by any means.\n\n1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:24.440\n And so there's an infinite variety of consciousnesses\n\n1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:29.440\n and signaling games that consciousnesses could interact via.\n\n1:49:30.120 --> 1:49:32.560\n And therefore worlds, your common worlds,\n\n1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:37.200\n data structures that they can use to communicate.\n\n1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:40.200\n So space and time is just one of an infinite variety.\n\n1:49:40.200 --> 1:49:43.600\n And so I think that what we'll find is that\n\n1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:46.280\n as we go outside of our little space time bubble,\n\n1:49:48.880 --> 1:49:51.760\n we will encounter utterly alien forms\n\n1:49:51.760 --> 1:49:54.920\n of conscious experience that we may not be able\n\n1:49:54.920 --> 1:49:59.920\n to really comprehend in the following sense.\n\n1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:03.120\n If I ask you to imagine a color\n\n1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:04.480\n that you've never seen before,\n\n1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:06.480\n does anything happen?\n\n1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:09.080\n Nothing happens.\n\n1:50:09.080 --> 1:50:11.120\n Nothing happens.\n\n1:50:11.120 --> 1:50:12.960\n And that's just one color.\n\n1:50:12.960 --> 1:50:14.640\n I'm asking for just a color.\n\n1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:16.320\n We actually know, by the way,\n\n1:50:16.320 --> 1:50:20.320\n that apparently there are women called tetraphams\n\n1:50:21.520 --> 1:50:25.600\n who have four color receptors, not just three.\n\n1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:28.840\n And Kimberly Jameson and others who've studied these women\n\n1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:31.080\n have good evidence that they apparently have\n\n1:50:31.080 --> 1:50:32.960\n a new dimension of color experience\n\n1:50:34.280 --> 1:50:35.840\n that the rest of us don't have.\n\n1:50:35.840 --> 1:50:40.240\n So these women are apparently living in a world of color\n\n1:50:40.240 --> 1:50:42.280\n that you and I can't even concretely imagine.\n\n1:50:42.280 --> 1:50:43.760\n No man can imagine them.\n\n1:50:43.760 --> 1:50:44.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:44.600 --> 1:50:46.840\n And yet they're real color experiences.\n\n1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:48.840\n And so in that sense, I'm saying,\n\n1:50:48.840 --> 1:50:50.960\n now take that little baby step,\n\n1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:52.960\n oh, there are women who have color experiences\n\n1:50:52.960 --> 1:50:53.800\n that I could never have.\n\n1:50:53.800 --> 1:50:55.000\n Well, that's shocking.\n\n1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.520\n Now take that infinite.\n\n1:50:57.520 --> 1:51:00.600\n There are consciousnesses where every aspect\n\n1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:03.440\n of their experiences is like that new color.\n\n1:51:03.440 --> 1:51:05.760\n It's something utterly alien to you.\n\n1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:07.840\n You have nothing like that.\n\n1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:10.040\n And yet these are all possible varieties\n\n1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:11.320\n of conscious experience.\n\n1:51:11.320 --> 1:51:13.360\n And when you say there's a lot of consciousnesses,\n\n1:51:13.360 --> 1:51:16.400\n as a singular consciousness,\n\n1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:19.960\n basically the set of possible experiences you can have\n\n1:51:19.960 --> 1:51:21.240\n in that subjective way,\n\n1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:25.040\n as opposed to the underlying mechanism.\n\n1:51:25.040 --> 1:51:28.000\n Because you say that, you know,\n\n1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:30.800\n having a extra color receptor,\n\n1:51:32.440 --> 1:51:34.080\n ability to have new experiences\n\n1:51:34.080 --> 1:51:36.640\n that somehow a different consciousness,\n\n1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:39.680\n is there a way to see that as all the same consciousness,\n\n1:51:39.680 --> 1:51:41.480\n the subjectivity itself?\n\n1:51:41.480 --> 1:51:42.320\n Right.\n\n1:51:42.320 --> 1:51:45.200\n Because when we have two of these conscious agents\n\n1:51:45.200 --> 1:51:46.720\n interacting, the mathematics,\n\n1:51:46.720 --> 1:51:49.560\n they actually satisfy the definition of a conscious agent.\n\n1:51:49.560 --> 1:51:52.240\n So in fact, they are a single conscious agent.\n\n1:51:52.240 --> 1:51:55.480\n So in fact, one way to think about what I'm saying,\n\n1:51:55.480 --> 1:51:57.360\n I'm postulating with my colleagues,\n\n1:51:57.360 --> 1:51:58.800\n Chaiton and Chris and others,\n\n1:51:58.800 --> 1:52:00.280\n Robert Pretner and so forth.\n\n1:52:01.920 --> 1:52:05.320\n There is one big conscious agent, infinitely complicated.\n\n1:52:05.320 --> 1:52:08.320\n But fortunately, we can, for analytic purposes,\n\n1:52:08.320 --> 1:52:10.160\n break it down all the way to,\n\n1:52:10.160 --> 1:52:11.760\n in some sense, the simplest conscious agent,\n\n1:52:11.760 --> 1:52:13.960\n which has one conscious experience, one.\n\n1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:18.360\n This one agent can experience red 35, and that's it.\n\n1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:20.280\n That's what it experiences.\n\n1:52:20.280 --> 1:52:22.840\n You can get all the way down to that.\n\n1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:26.880\n So you think it's possible that consciousness,\n\n1:52:27.720 --> 1:52:29.200\n whatever that is,\n\n1:52:30.320 --> 1:52:34.040\n is much more, is fundamental,\n\n1:52:34.040 --> 1:52:37.520\n or at least much more in the direction of the fundamental\n\n1:52:37.520 --> 1:52:40.520\n than is space time as we perceive it?\n\n1:52:40.520 --> 1:52:42.520\n That's the proposal.\n\n1:52:42.520 --> 1:52:45.040\n And therefore, what I have to do,\n\n1:52:45.040 --> 1:52:47.560\n in terms of the hard problem of consciousness,\n\n1:52:47.560 --> 1:52:51.680\n is to show how dynamical systems of conscious agents\n\n1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:54.000\n could lead to what we call space and time\n\n1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.720\n and neurons and brain activity.\n\n1:52:56.720 --> 1:53:00.400\n In other words, we have to show how you get space time\n\n1:53:00.400 --> 1:53:05.400\n and physical objects entirely from a theory\n\n1:53:05.440 --> 1:53:07.720\n of conscious agents outside of space time,\n\n1:53:07.720 --> 1:53:10.560\n with the dynamics outside of space time.\n\n1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:13.960\n So that's, and I can tell you how we plan to do that,\n\n1:53:13.960 --> 1:53:15.800\n but that's the idea.\n\n1:53:15.800 --> 1:53:18.920\n Okay, the magic of it, that chocolate is delicious.\n\n1:53:19.800 --> 1:53:22.760\n So there's a mathematical kind of thing\n\n1:53:22.760 --> 1:53:24.480\n that we could say here, how it can emerge\n\n1:53:24.480 --> 1:53:27.800\n within this system of networks of conscious agents,\n\n1:53:27.800 --> 1:53:32.800\n but is there going to be at the end of the proof\n\n1:53:34.120 --> 1:53:36.760\n why chocolate is so delicious?\n\n1:53:36.760 --> 1:53:38.280\n Or no?\n\n1:53:38.280 --> 1:53:41.960\n I guess I'm going to ask different kinds of dumb questions\n\n1:53:41.960 --> 1:53:43.200\n to try to sneak up.\n\n1:53:43.200 --> 1:53:45.760\n Oh, well, that's the right question, and when I say\n\n1:53:45.760 --> 1:53:48.080\n that I took conscious experiences as fundamental,\n\n1:53:48.080 --> 1:53:51.560\n what that means is, in the current version of my theory,\n\n1:53:51.560 --> 1:53:54.120\n I'm not explaining conscious experiences\n\n1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:55.720\n where they came from.\n\n1:53:55.720 --> 1:53:58.160\n That's the miracle, that's one of the miracles.\n\n1:53:58.160 --> 1:53:59.600\n So I have two miracles in my theory.\n\n1:53:59.600 --> 1:54:02.320\n There are conscious experiences, like the taste of chocolate,\n\n1:54:02.320 --> 1:54:06.200\n and that there's a probabilistic relationship.\n\n1:54:06.200 --> 1:54:08.680\n When certain conscious experiences occur,\n\n1:54:08.680 --> 1:54:10.560\n others are more likely to occur.\n\n1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:12.680\n Those are the two miracles that are possible.\n\n1:54:12.680 --> 1:54:17.600\n Is it possible to get beyond that\n\n1:54:17.600 --> 1:54:19.600\n and somehow start to chip away\n\n1:54:19.600 --> 1:54:22.440\n at the miracleness of that miracle,\n\n1:54:22.440 --> 1:54:24.720\n that chocolate is delicious?\n\n1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:25.560\n I hope so.\n\n1:54:25.560 --> 1:54:27.680\n I've got my hands full with what I'm doing right now,\n\n1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:32.240\n but I can just say at top level how I would think about that.\n\n1:54:32.240 --> 1:54:33.480\n That would get at this\n\n1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:40.160\n consciousness without form.\n\n1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:45.160\n This is really tough, because it's consciousness without form\n\n1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:50.200\n versus the various forms that consciousness takes\n\n1:54:50.200 --> 1:54:52.080\n for the experiences that it has.\n\n1:54:53.440 --> 1:54:55.080\n Right, right.\n\n1:54:55.080 --> 1:55:00.080\n So when I write down a probability space\n\n1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:03.320\n for these conscious experiences, I say,\n\n1:55:03.320 --> 1:55:04.280\n here's a probability space\n\n1:55:04.280 --> 1:55:07.080\n for the possible conscious experiences, right?\n\n1:55:07.080 --> 1:55:08.760\n It's just like when I write down a probability space\n\n1:55:08.760 --> 1:55:09.640\n for an experiment.\n\n1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:12.520\n Like I'm gonna flip a coin twice, right?\n\n1:55:12.520 --> 1:55:15.240\n And I want to look at the probabilities of various outcomes.\n\n1:55:15.240 --> 1:55:16.400\n So I have to write down a probability space.\n\n1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:18.640\n There could be heads, heads, heads, tails,\n\n1:55:18.640 --> 1:55:20.440\n tails, heads, tails, tails.\n\n1:55:20.440 --> 1:55:24.080\n So any class of probability you're told,\n\n1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:25.400\n write down your probability space.\n\n1:55:25.400 --> 1:55:26.760\n If you don't write down your probability space,\n\n1:55:26.760 --> 1:55:28.200\n you can't get started.\n\n1:55:28.200 --> 1:55:30.680\n So here's my probability space for consciousness.\n\n1:55:30.680 --> 1:55:33.280\n How do I want to interpret that structure?\n\n1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:34.600\n The structure is just sitting there.\n\n1:55:34.600 --> 1:55:37.560\n There's gonna be a dynamics that happens on it, right?\n\n1:55:37.560 --> 1:55:39.640\n Experiences appear and then they disappear,\n\n1:55:39.640 --> 1:55:42.000\n just like heads appears and disappears.\n\n1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:46.380\n So one way to think about that fundamental\n\n1:55:46.380 --> 1:55:49.480\n probability space is that corresponds\n\n1:55:49.480 --> 1:55:51.280\n to consciousness without any content.\n\n1:55:53.080 --> 1:55:57.120\n The infinite consciousness that transcends\n\n1:55:57.120 --> 1:55:58.800\n any particular content.\n\n1:55:58.800 --> 1:56:00.600\n Well, do you think of that as a mechanism,\n\n1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:05.520\n as a thing, like the rules that govern the dynamics\n\n1:56:05.520 --> 1:56:08.560\n of the thing outside of space time?\n\n1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:10.720\n Isn't that, if you think consciousness is fundamental,\n\n1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:12.760\n isn't that essentially getting like,\n\n1:56:12.760 --> 1:56:14.920\n it is solving the hard problem,\n\n1:56:14.920 --> 1:56:19.920\n which is like from where does this thing pop up,\n\n1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:24.320\n which is the mechanism of the thing popping up,\n\n1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:25.800\n whatever the consciousness is,\n\n1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:29.680\n the different kinds and so on, that mechanism.\n\n1:56:29.680 --> 1:56:34.200\n And also, the question I want to ask is how tricky\n\n1:56:34.200 --> 1:56:38.280\n do you think it is to solve that problem?\n\n1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:40.280\n You've solved a lot of difficult problems\n\n1:56:40.280 --> 1:56:42.080\n throughout the history of humanity.\n\n1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:47.600\n There's probably more problems to solve left\n\n1:56:47.600 --> 1:56:51.520\n than we've solved by like an infinity.\n\n1:56:52.900 --> 1:56:57.140\n But along that long journey of intelligent species,\n\n1:56:58.640 --> 1:57:01.080\n when will we solve this consciousness one?\n\n1:57:01.080 --> 1:57:04.020\n Which is one way to measure the difficulty of the problem.\n\n1:57:04.020 --> 1:57:05.560\n So I'll give two answers.\n\n1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:07.600\n There's one problem I think we can solve,\n\n1:57:08.680 --> 1:57:09.880\n but we haven't solved yet.\n\n1:57:09.880 --> 1:57:11.160\n And that is the reverse\n\n1:57:11.160 --> 1:57:13.720\n of what my colleagues call the hard problem.\n\n1:57:14.900 --> 1:57:17.180\n The problem of how do you start with conscious experiences\n\n1:57:17.180 --> 1:57:19.680\n in the way that I've just described them and the dynamics\n\n1:57:19.680 --> 1:57:21.840\n and build up space and time and brains,\n\n1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:25.120\n that I think is a tough technical problem,\n\n1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:26.240\n but it's in principle solvable.\n\n1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:27.760\n So I think we can solve that.\n\n1:57:27.760 --> 1:57:29.400\n So we would solve the hard problem,\n\n1:57:29.400 --> 1:57:31.280\n not by showing how brains create consciousness,\n\n1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:33.080\n but how networks of conscious agents\n\n1:57:33.080 --> 1:57:36.000\n create what we call the symbols that we call brains.\n\n1:57:38.520 --> 1:57:40.040\n So that I think.\n\n1:57:40.040 --> 1:57:42.160\n But does that allow you to, so that's interesting.\n\n1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:43.480\n That's an interesting idea.\n\n1:57:43.480 --> 1:57:44.720\n Consciousness creates the brain,\n\n1:57:44.720 --> 1:57:46.420\n not the brain creates consciousness.\n\n1:57:46.420 --> 1:57:48.560\n But does that allow you to build the thing?\n\n1:57:49.440 --> 1:57:53.800\n My guess is that it will enable unbelievable technologies.\n\n1:57:53.800 --> 1:57:55.880\n Once, and I'll tell you why.\n\n1:57:55.880 --> 1:57:57.760\n I think it plugs into the work\n\n1:57:57.760 --> 1:57:58.880\n that the physicists are doing.\n\n1:57:58.880 --> 1:58:01.920\n So this theory of consciousness will be even deeper\n\n1:58:01.920 --> 1:58:03.960\n than the structures that the physicists are finding,\n\n1:58:03.960 --> 1:58:05.160\n like the amplituhedron.\n\n1:58:06.200 --> 1:58:09.300\n But the other answer to your question is less positive.\n\n1:58:10.960 --> 1:58:13.080\n As I said earlier, I think that there is no such thing\n\n1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:14.400\n as a theory of everything.\n\n1:58:15.800 --> 1:58:20.800\n So that I think that the theory that my team is working on,\n\n1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:25.460\n this conscious agent theory, is just a 1.0 theory.\n\n1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:29.920\n We're using probability spaces and Markovian curls.\n\n1:58:29.920 --> 1:58:31.800\n I can easily see people now saying,\n\n1:58:31.800 --> 1:58:35.040\n well, we can do better if we go to category theory.\n\n1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:38.840\n And we can get a deeper, perhaps more interesting.\n\n1:58:38.840 --> 1:58:39.780\n And then someone will say,\n\n1:58:39.780 --> 1:58:41.480\n well, now I'll go to topoi theory.\n\n1:58:42.440 --> 1:58:45.600\n So I imagine that there'll be conscious agents,\n\n1:58:45.600 --> 1:58:50.600\n five, 10, 3 trillion, 0.0, but I think it will never end.\n\n1:58:51.760 --> 1:58:54.360\n I think ultimately this question\n\n1:58:54.360 --> 1:58:56.680\n that we sort of put our fingers on of,\n\n1:58:56.680 --> 1:59:01.680\n how does the formless give birth to form,\n\n1:59:03.080 --> 1:59:05.800\n to the wonderful taste of chocolate?\n\n1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:10.200\n I think that we will always go deeper and deeper,\n\n1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:11.600\n but we will never solve that.\n\n1:59:12.680 --> 1:59:15.120\n That in some sense, that will be a primitive.\n\n1:59:15.120 --> 1:59:16.760\n I hope I'm wrong.\n\n1:59:16.760 --> 1:59:21.220\n Maybe it's just the limits of my current imagination.\n\n1:59:23.080 --> 1:59:26.000\n So I'll just say my imagination right now\n\n1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:28.840\n doesn't peer that deep.\n\n1:59:30.280 --> 1:59:31.640\n By the way, I'm saying this,\n\n1:59:31.640 --> 1:59:35.120\n I don't want to discourage some brilliant 20 year old\n\n1:59:35.120 --> 1:59:37.920\n who then later on proves me dead wrong.\n\n1:59:37.920 --> 1:59:39.360\n I hope to be proven dead wrong.\n\n1:59:39.360 --> 1:59:41.040\n Just like you said, essentially from now,\n\n1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:43.320\n everything we're saying now, everything you're saying,\n\n1:59:43.320 --> 1:59:45.600\n all your theories will be laughing stock.\n\n1:59:45.600 --> 1:59:50.600\n They will respect the puzzle solving abilities\n\n1:59:51.120 --> 1:59:54.040\n and how much we were able to do with so little.\n\n1:59:54.040 --> 1:59:58.240\n But outside of that, you will all be just,\n\n1:59:58.240 --> 2:00:01.760\n the silliness will be entertainment for a teenager.\n\n2:00:01.760 --> 2:00:03.120\n Especially the silliness when we thought\n\n2:00:03.120 --> 2:00:06.000\n that we were so smart and we knew it all.\n\n2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:08.320\n So it would be interesting to explore your ideas\n\n2:00:08.320 --> 2:00:12.560\n by contrasting, you mentioned Annika, Annika Harris,\n\n2:00:12.560 --> 2:00:14.560\n you mentioned Philip Goff.\n\n2:00:15.720 --> 2:00:18.320\n So outside of, if you're not allowed to say\n\n2:00:19.480 --> 2:00:21.640\n the fundamental disagreement is the fact\n\n2:00:21.640 --> 2:00:24.400\n that space time is fundamental.\n\n2:00:24.400 --> 2:00:26.600\n What are interesting distinctions\n\n2:00:26.600 --> 2:00:28.440\n between ideas of consciousness\n\n2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:30.080\n between you and Annika, for example?\n\n2:00:30.080 --> 2:00:33.360\n You guys have, you've been on a podcast together,\n\n2:00:33.360 --> 2:00:36.600\n I'm sure in private you guys\n\n2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:38.080\n have some incredible conversations.\n\n2:00:38.080 --> 2:00:41.560\n So where are some interesting sticking points,\n\n2:00:41.560 --> 2:00:44.040\n some interesting disagreements,\n\n2:00:44.040 --> 2:00:45.680\n let's say with Annika first.\n\n2:00:45.680 --> 2:00:47.640\n Maybe there'll be a few other people.\n\n2:00:47.640 --> 2:00:49.680\n Well, Annika and I just had a conversation this morning\n\n2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:51.560\n where we were talking about our ideas\n\n2:00:51.560 --> 2:00:53.800\n and what we discovered really in our conversation\n\n2:00:53.800 --> 2:00:57.040\n was that we're pretty much on the same page.\n\n2:00:57.040 --> 2:01:00.920\n It was really just about consciousness.\n\n2:01:00.920 --> 2:01:02.040\n Our ideas about consciousness\n\n2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:04.040\n are pretty much on the same page.\n\n2:01:04.040 --> 2:01:07.840\n She rightly has cautioned me to,\n\n2:01:07.840 --> 2:01:10.080\n when I talk about conscious agents,\n\n2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:12.000\n to point out that the notion of agency\n\n2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:15.800\n is not fundamental in my theory.\n\n2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:17.240\n The notion of self is not fundamental\n\n2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:18.880\n and that's absolutely true.\n\n2:01:18.880 --> 2:01:22.520\n I can use this network of conscious agents,\n\n2:01:22.520 --> 2:01:25.000\n I now use as a technical term,\n\n2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:26.400\n conscious agent is a technical term\n\n2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:29.320\n for that probability space with the Markovian dynamics.\n\n2:01:29.320 --> 2:01:31.840\n I can use that to build models of a self\n\n2:01:31.840 --> 2:01:33.240\n and to build models of agency,\n\n2:01:33.240 --> 2:01:35.200\n but they're not fundamental.\n\n2:01:35.200 --> 2:01:40.200\n So she has really been very helpful\n\n2:01:40.320 --> 2:01:43.600\n in helping me to be a little bit clear about these ideas\n\n2:01:43.600 --> 2:01:45.880\n and not say things that are misleading.\n\n2:01:45.880 --> 2:01:50.000\n This is the interesting thing about language, actually,\n\n2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.320\n is that language, quite obviously,\n\n2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:56.640\n is an interface to truth.\n\n2:01:56.640 --> 2:02:00.400\n It's so fascinating that individual words\n\n2:02:01.400 --> 2:02:05.680\n can have so much ambiguity\n\n2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:10.680\n and the specific choices of a word\n\n2:02:10.760 --> 2:02:12.120\n within a particular sentence,\n\n2:02:12.120 --> 2:02:13.600\n within the context of a sentence,\n\n2:02:13.600 --> 2:02:17.240\n can have such a difference in meaning.\n\n2:02:17.240 --> 2:02:18.600\n It's quite fascinating,\n\n2:02:18.600 --> 2:02:20.360\n especially when you're talking about topics\n\n2:02:20.360 --> 2:02:23.960\n like consciousness, because it's a very loaded term.\n\n2:02:23.960 --> 2:02:26.160\n It means a lot of things to a lot of people\n\n2:02:26.160 --> 2:02:29.120\n and the entire concept is shrouded in mystery.\n\n2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:32.440\n So a combination of the fact that it's a loaded term\n\n2:02:32.440 --> 2:02:34.320\n and that there's a lot of mystery,\n\n2:02:34.320 --> 2:02:36.920\n people can just interpret it in all kinds of ways.\n\n2:02:36.920 --> 2:02:39.160\n And so you have to be both precise\n\n2:02:39.160 --> 2:02:43.640\n and help them avoid getting stuck\n\n2:02:43.640 --> 2:02:48.120\n on some kind of side road of miscommunication,\n\n2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:50.840\n lost in translation because you used the wrong word.\n\n2:02:50.840 --> 2:02:51.680\n That's interesting.\n\n2:02:51.680 --> 2:02:54.380\n I mean, because for a lot of people,\n\n2:02:54.380 --> 2:02:59.100\n consciousness is ultimately connected to a self.\n\n2:03:01.080 --> 2:03:04.920\n I mean, that's our experience of consciousness\n\n2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:08.840\n is very, it's connected to this ego.\n\n2:03:08.840 --> 2:03:12.840\n I mean, I just, I mean, what else could it possibly be?\n\n2:03:12.840 --> 2:03:15.760\n I can't even, how do you begin to comprehend,\n\n2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:19.000\n to visualize, to conceptualize a consciousness\n\n2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:22.420\n that's not connected to like this particular organism?\n\n2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:26.520\n I have a way of thinking about this whole problem now\n\n2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:29.660\n that comes out of this framework that's different.\n\n2:03:30.900 --> 2:03:34.260\n So we can imagine a dynamics of consciousness,\n\n2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:37.660\n not in space and time, just abstractly.\n\n2:03:37.660 --> 2:03:40.560\n It could be cooperative for all we know.\n\n2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:42.580\n It could be very friendly, I don't know.\n\n2:03:43.960 --> 2:03:46.720\n And you can set up a dynamics, a Markovian dynamics\n\n2:03:46.720 --> 2:03:48.820\n that is so called stationary.\n\n2:03:48.820 --> 2:03:50.160\n And that's a technical term,\n\n2:03:50.160 --> 2:03:53.400\n which means that the entropy effectively is not increasing.\n\n2:03:53.400 --> 2:03:55.160\n There is some entropy, but it's constant.\n\n2:03:55.160 --> 2:03:56.960\n So there's no increasing entropy.\n\n2:03:56.960 --> 2:04:00.340\n And in that sense, the dynamics is timeless.\n\n2:04:01.540 --> 2:04:05.620\n There is no entropic time, but it's a trivial theorem,\n\n2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:10.620\n three line proof that if you have a stationary\n\n2:04:10.620 --> 2:04:13.860\n Markovian dynamics, any projection that you make\n\n2:04:13.860 --> 2:04:16.240\n of that dynamics by conditional probability.\n\n2:04:16.240 --> 2:04:17.980\n And if you want, I can state a little bit more,\n\n2:04:17.980 --> 2:04:19.340\n even more mathematically precisely\n\n2:04:19.340 --> 2:04:21.920\n for some readers or listeners.\n\n2:04:21.920 --> 2:04:25.120\n But if any projection you take by conditional probability,\n\n2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:28.980\n the induced image of that Markov chain\n\n2:04:28.980 --> 2:04:30.380\n will have increasing entropy.\n\n2:04:32.940 --> 2:04:34.100\n You will have entropic time.\n\n2:04:34.100 --> 2:04:36.140\n So I'll be very, very precise.\n\n2:04:36.140 --> 2:04:40.740\n I have a Markov chain X1, X2 through Xn\n\n2:04:40.740 --> 2:04:42.540\n where Xn, n goes to infinity, right?\n\n2:04:43.800 --> 2:04:48.800\n The entropy H, capital H of Xn is equal to the entropy H\n\n2:04:49.680 --> 2:04:51.600\n of Xn minus one for all n.\n\n2:04:52.440 --> 2:04:54.180\n So the entropy is the same.\n\n2:04:55.660 --> 2:05:00.660\n But it's a theorem that H of Xn,\n\n2:05:00.660 --> 2:05:05.660\n say given X sub one is greater than or equal to\n\n2:05:06.100 --> 2:05:09.460\n H of Xn minus one given X1.\n\n2:05:10.900 --> 2:05:13.580\n Sure, where does the greater come from?\n\n2:05:13.580 --> 2:05:15.980\n Because with the theorem, the three line proof,\n\n2:05:17.220 --> 2:05:22.220\n H of Xn given X1 is greater than or equal to H of Xn\n\n2:05:23.940 --> 2:05:27.500\n given X1 and X2 because conditioning reduces.\n\n2:05:27.500 --> 2:05:32.500\n But then H of Xn minus one given X1, X2\n\n2:05:35.340 --> 2:05:39.620\n is equal to H of Xn given X2,\n\n2:05:39.620 --> 2:05:43.080\n Xn minus one given X2 by the Markov property.\n\n2:05:44.020 --> 2:05:49.020\n And then because it's stationary, it's equal to H of X.\n\n2:05:51.840 --> 2:05:53.180\n I have to write it down.\n\n2:05:53.180 --> 2:05:56.820\n Anyway, there's a three line proof.\n\n2:05:56.820 --> 2:06:00.940\n Sure, but the assumption of stationarity,\n\n2:06:02.100 --> 2:06:04.540\n we're using a lot of terms that people won't understand,\n\n2:06:04.540 --> 2:06:05.380\n doesn't matter.\n\n2:06:07.020 --> 2:06:10.220\n So there's some kind of, some Markovian dynamics\n\n2:06:10.220 --> 2:06:13.540\n is basically trying to model some kind of system\n\n2:06:13.540 --> 2:06:15.700\n with some probabilities and there's agents\n\n2:06:15.700 --> 2:06:17.260\n and they interact in some kind of way\n\n2:06:17.260 --> 2:06:19.980\n and you can say something about that system\n\n2:06:19.980 --> 2:06:22.900\n as it evolves stationarity.\n\n2:06:22.900 --> 2:06:27.900\n So a stationary system is one that has certain properties\n\n2:06:28.600 --> 2:06:30.820\n in terms of entropy, very well.\n\n2:06:30.820 --> 2:06:33.020\n But we don't know if it's stationary or not.\n\n2:06:33.020 --> 2:06:35.520\n We don't know what the properties.\n\n2:06:35.520 --> 2:06:36.500\n Right.\n\n2:06:36.500 --> 2:06:38.220\n So you have to kind of take assumptions\n\n2:06:38.220 --> 2:06:42.040\n and see, okay, well, what does the system behave like\n\n2:06:42.040 --> 2:06:43.580\n under these different properties?\n\n2:06:43.580 --> 2:06:46.340\n The more constraints, the more assumptions you take,\n\n2:06:46.340 --> 2:06:49.900\n the more interesting, powerful things you can say,\n\n2:06:49.900 --> 2:06:52.060\n but sometimes they're limiting.\n\n2:06:52.060 --> 2:06:54.460\n That said, we're talking about consciousness here.\n\n2:06:54.460 --> 2:06:55.980\n Right.\n\n2:06:55.980 --> 2:07:00.980\n How does that, you said cooperative, okay, competitive.\n\n2:07:02.420 --> 2:07:04.140\n It just, I like chocolate.\n\n2:07:04.140 --> 2:07:08.500\n I'm sitting here, I have a brain, I'm wearing a suit.\n\n2:07:08.500 --> 2:07:11.220\n It sure as hell feels like I'm myself.\n\n2:07:11.220 --> 2:07:12.060\n Right.\n\n2:07:12.060 --> 2:07:14.660\n Now, what, am I tuning in?\n\n2:07:14.660 --> 2:07:16.820\n Am I plugging into something?\n\n2:07:16.820 --> 2:07:20.700\n Am I a projection, a simple, trivial projection\n\n2:07:20.700 --> 2:07:23.980\n into space time from some much larger organism\n\n2:07:23.980 --> 2:07:25.980\n that I can't possibly comprehend?\n\n2:07:25.980 --> 2:07:28.020\n How the hell, you're saying some,\n\n2:07:28.020 --> 2:07:31.500\n you're building up mathematical intuitions, fine, great.\n\n2:07:31.500 --> 2:07:35.100\n But I'm just, I'm having an existential crisis here\n\n2:07:35.100 --> 2:07:36.700\n and I'm gonna die soon.\n\n2:07:36.700 --> 2:07:37.940\n Well, I'll die pretty quickly.\n\n2:07:37.940 --> 2:07:42.200\n So I wanna figure out why chocolate's so delicious.\n\n2:07:43.300 --> 2:07:44.200\n So help me out here.\n\n2:07:44.200 --> 2:07:47.100\n So let's just keep sneaking up to this.\n\n2:07:47.100 --> 2:07:52.100\n Right, so the whole technical thing was to say this.\n\n2:07:52.500 --> 2:07:56.220\n Even if the dynamics of consciousness is stationary\n\n2:07:56.220 --> 2:07:58.720\n so that there is no entropic time,\n\n2:07:58.720 --> 2:08:02.500\n any projection of it, any view of it\n\n2:08:03.940 --> 2:08:07.440\n will have the artifact of entropic time.\n\n2:08:08.620 --> 2:08:10.860\n That's a limited resource.\n\n2:08:10.860 --> 2:08:14.220\n Limited resources, so that the fundamental dynamics\n\n2:08:14.220 --> 2:08:17.500\n may have no limits, limited resources whatsoever.\n\n2:08:17.500 --> 2:08:19.980\n Any projection will have certainly time\n\n2:08:19.980 --> 2:08:21.180\n as a limited resource\n\n2:08:21.180 --> 2:08:24.140\n and probably lots of other limited resources.\n\n2:08:24.140 --> 2:08:28.140\n Hence, we could get competition and evolution\n\n2:08:28.140 --> 2:08:30.400\n and nature, red and tooth and claw\n\n2:08:30.400 --> 2:08:32.700\n as an artifact of a deeper system\n\n2:08:32.700 --> 2:08:34.600\n in which those aren't fundamental.\n\n2:08:34.600 --> 2:08:37.820\n And in fact, I take it as something\n\n2:08:37.820 --> 2:08:41.020\n that this theory must do at some point\n\n2:08:41.020 --> 2:08:42.740\n is to show how networks of conscious agents,\n\n2:08:42.740 --> 2:08:45.660\n even if they're not resource limited,\n\n2:08:45.660 --> 2:08:47.620\n give rise to evolution by natural selection\n\n2:08:47.620 --> 2:08:49.340\n via a projection.\n\n2:08:49.340 --> 2:08:51.100\n Yeah, but you're saying,\n\n2:08:51.100 --> 2:08:53.260\n I'm trying to understand how the limited resources\n\n2:08:53.260 --> 2:08:54.360\n that give rise to,\n\n2:08:55.540 --> 2:08:57.940\n so first the thing gives rise to time,\n\n2:08:57.940 --> 2:08:59.860\n that gives rise to limited resource,\n\n2:08:59.860 --> 2:09:03.140\n that gives rise to evolution by natural selection,\n\n2:09:03.140 --> 2:09:05.940\n how that has to do with the fact that chocolate's delicious?\n\n2:09:05.940 --> 2:09:08.060\n Well, it's not gonna do that directly.\n\n2:09:08.060 --> 2:09:10.700\n It's gonna get to this notion of self.\n\n2:09:10.700 --> 2:09:12.140\n Oh, it's gonna give you?\n\n2:09:12.140 --> 2:09:12.980\n The notion of self.\n\n2:09:12.980 --> 2:09:14.700\n Oh, the evolution gives you the notion of self.\n\n2:09:14.700 --> 2:09:18.420\n And also of a self separate from other selves.\n\n2:09:18.420 --> 2:09:20.140\n So the idea would be that.\n\n2:09:20.140 --> 2:09:22.140\n It's competition, it has life and death,\n\n2:09:22.140 --> 2:09:23.300\n all those kinds of things.\n\n2:09:23.300 --> 2:09:24.140\n That's right.\n\n2:09:24.140 --> 2:09:26.740\n So it won't, I don't think,\n\n2:09:26.740 --> 2:09:28.540\n as I said, I don't think that I can tell you\n\n2:09:28.540 --> 2:09:30.180\n how the formless gives rise\n\n2:09:30.180 --> 2:09:32.380\n to the experience of chocolate.\n\n2:09:32.380 --> 2:09:33.660\n Right now, my current theory says\n\n2:09:33.660 --> 2:09:35.700\n that's one of the miracles I'm assuming.\n\n2:09:35.700 --> 2:09:36.660\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:36.660 --> 2:09:38.180\n So my theory can't do it.\n\n2:09:38.180 --> 2:09:39.260\n And the reason my theory can't do it\n\n2:09:39.260 --> 2:09:41.460\n is because Hoffman's brain can't do it right now.\n\n2:09:41.460 --> 2:09:45.980\n But the notion of self, yes.\n\n2:09:45.980 --> 2:09:49.060\n The notion of self can be an artifact\n\n2:09:49.060 --> 2:09:51.700\n of the projection of it.\n\n2:09:51.700 --> 2:09:53.780\n So there's one conscious agent.\n\n2:09:55.340 --> 2:09:56.780\n Because anytime conscious agents interact,\n\n2:09:56.780 --> 2:09:57.860\n they form a new conscious agent.\n\n2:09:57.860 --> 2:09:59.380\n So there's one conscious agent.\n\n2:10:00.300 --> 2:10:02.620\n Any projection of that one conscious agent\n\n2:10:02.620 --> 2:10:05.060\n gives rise to time,\n\n2:10:05.060 --> 2:10:07.660\n even if there wasn't any time in that one conscious agent.\n\n2:10:07.660 --> 2:10:10.060\n And it gives rise, I want to,\n\n2:10:10.060 --> 2:10:10.900\n now I haven't proven this.\n\n2:10:10.900 --> 2:10:13.220\n So this is, so now this is me guessing\n\n2:10:13.220 --> 2:10:14.820\n where the theory is going to go.\n\n2:10:14.820 --> 2:10:15.660\n I haven't done this.\n\n2:10:15.660 --> 2:10:16.860\n There's no paper on this yet.\n\n2:10:16.860 --> 2:10:18.380\n So now I'm speculating.\n\n2:10:18.380 --> 2:10:20.180\n My guess is I'll be able to show,\n\n2:10:20.180 --> 2:10:22.460\n or my brighter colleagues working with me\n\n2:10:22.460 --> 2:10:23.660\n will be able to show\n\n2:10:23.660 --> 2:10:26.660\n that we will get evolution of a natural selection,\n\n2:10:26.660 --> 2:10:28.260\n the notion of individual selves,\n\n2:10:28.260 --> 2:10:29.940\n individual physical objects and so forth\n\n2:10:29.940 --> 2:10:31.620\n coming out as a projection of this thing.\n\n2:10:31.620 --> 2:10:35.900\n And that the self, this then will be really interesting\n\n2:10:35.900 --> 2:10:37.420\n in terms of how it starts to interact\n\n2:10:37.420 --> 2:10:40.980\n with certain spiritual traditions, right?\n\n2:10:40.980 --> 2:10:44.100\n Where they will say that there is a notion of self\n\n2:10:44.100 --> 2:10:45.540\n that needs to be let go,\n\n2:10:45.540 --> 2:10:46.860\n which is this finite self\n\n2:10:46.860 --> 2:10:48.300\n that's competing with other selves\n\n2:10:48.300 --> 2:10:52.020\n to get more money and prestige and so forth.\n\n2:10:52.020 --> 2:10:54.380\n That self in some sense has to die.\n\n2:10:54.380 --> 2:10:56.460\n But there's a deeper self,\n\n2:10:56.460 --> 2:11:00.580\n which is the timeless being\n\n2:11:01.660 --> 2:11:04.340\n that precludes, not precludes,\n\n2:11:04.340 --> 2:11:08.220\n but precedes any particular conscious experiences,\n\n2:11:08.220 --> 2:11:10.380\n the ground of all experience.\n\n2:11:10.380 --> 2:11:13.660\n That there's that notion of a deep capital self.\n\n2:11:13.660 --> 2:11:17.980\n But our little capital, lowercase s selves\n\n2:11:17.980 --> 2:11:20.820\n could be artifacts of projection.\n\n2:11:20.820 --> 2:11:25.620\n And it may be that what consciousness is doing\n\n2:11:25.620 --> 2:11:26.780\n in this framework is, right?\n\n2:11:26.780 --> 2:11:30.300\n It's projected itself down into a self\n\n2:11:30.300 --> 2:11:31.420\n that calls itself dawn\n\n2:11:31.420 --> 2:11:33.940\n and a self that calls itself lax.\n\n2:11:33.940 --> 2:11:36.020\n And through conversations like this,\n\n2:11:36.020 --> 2:11:37.900\n it's trying to find out about itself\n\n2:11:37.900 --> 2:11:41.180\n and eventually transcend the limits\n\n2:11:41.180 --> 2:11:45.860\n of the dawn and lax little icons that it's using\n\n2:11:45.860 --> 2:11:49.020\n and that little projection of itself.\n\n2:11:49.020 --> 2:11:50.580\n Through this conversation,\n\n2:11:50.580 --> 2:11:53.620\n somehow it's learning about itself.\n\n2:11:53.620 --> 2:11:56.620\n So that thing dressed me up today\n\n2:11:57.700 --> 2:11:59.940\n in order to understand itself.\n\n2:11:59.940 --> 2:12:02.220\n And in some sense, you and I are not separate\n\n2:12:02.220 --> 2:12:03.940\n from that thing and we're not separate from each other.\n\n2:12:03.940 --> 2:12:06.980\n Yeah, well, I have to question the fashion choices\n\n2:12:06.980 --> 2:12:08.500\n on my end then.\n\n2:12:08.500 --> 2:12:10.900\n All right, so you mentioned you agree\n\n2:12:10.900 --> 2:12:15.500\n in terms of consciousness on a lot of things with Anika.\n\n2:12:15.500 --> 2:12:20.260\n Is there somebody, friend or friendly foe\n\n2:12:20.260 --> 2:12:25.260\n that you disagree with in some nuanced, interesting way\n\n2:12:25.540 --> 2:12:28.580\n or some major way about consciousness,\n\n2:12:28.580 --> 2:12:32.640\n about these topics of reality that you return to?\n\n2:12:34.340 --> 2:12:38.660\n Often, it's like Christopher Hitchens\n\n2:12:38.660 --> 2:12:43.460\n with Rabbi David Wolpe have had interesting conversations\n\n2:12:43.460 --> 2:12:46.260\n through years that added to the complexity\n\n2:12:46.260 --> 2:12:47.660\n and the beauty of their friendship.\n\n2:12:47.660 --> 2:12:51.940\n Is there somebody like that that over the years\n\n2:12:51.940 --> 2:12:54.540\n has been a source of disagreement with you\n\n2:12:54.540 --> 2:12:56.180\n that's strengthened your ideas?\n\n2:12:56.180 --> 2:13:01.180\n Hmm, my ideas have been really shaped by several things.\n\n2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:06.600\n One is the physicalist framework\n\n2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:10.460\n that my scientific colleagues, almost to a person,\n\n2:13:10.460 --> 2:13:12.800\n have adopted and that I adopted too.\n\n2:13:12.800 --> 2:13:15.120\n And the reason I walked away from it was\n\n2:13:15.120 --> 2:13:20.120\n because it became clear that we couldn't start\n\n2:13:20.420 --> 2:13:22.880\n with unconscious ingredients and boot up consciousness.\n\n2:13:22.880 --> 2:13:27.880\n Can you define physicalist in contrast to reductionist?\n\n2:13:28.720 --> 2:13:33.120\n So a physicalist, I would say as someone\n\n2:13:33.120 --> 2:13:35.920\n who takes space time and the objects within space time\n\n2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:38.880\n as ontologically fundamental.\n\n2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:42.080\n Right, and then reductionist is saying\n\n2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:43.760\n the smaller, the more fundamental.\n\n2:13:43.760 --> 2:13:45.840\n That's a methodological thing.\n\n2:13:45.840 --> 2:13:47.960\n That's saying within space time,\n\n2:13:47.960 --> 2:13:50.520\n as you go to smaller and smaller scales in space,\n\n2:13:50.520 --> 2:13:53.080\n you get deeper and deeper laws, more and more fundamental\n\n2:13:53.080 --> 2:13:57.360\n laws and the reduction of temperature\n\n2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:01.280\n to particle movement was an example of that.\n\n2:14:01.280 --> 2:14:03.960\n But I think that the reason that worked\n\n2:14:03.960 --> 2:14:07.960\n was almost an artifact of the nature of our interface.\n\n2:14:07.960 --> 2:14:10.320\n That was for a long time and your colleagues,\n\n2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:12.060\n including yourself, were physicalists\n\n2:14:12.060 --> 2:14:13.480\n and now you broke away.\n\n2:14:13.480 --> 2:14:15.640\n Broke away because I think you can't start\n\n2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:18.400\n with unconscious ingredients and boot up consciousness.\n\n2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:21.200\n And so even with Roger Penrose\n\n2:14:21.200 --> 2:14:23.840\n where there's like a gray area.\n\n2:14:23.840 --> 2:14:26.840\n Right, and here's the challenge I would put\n\n2:14:26.840 --> 2:14:30.000\n to all of my friends and colleagues\n\n2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:34.080\n who give one specific conscious experience\n\n2:14:36.040 --> 2:14:37.640\n that you can boot up, right?\n\n2:14:37.640 --> 2:14:40.680\n So if you think that it's integrated information\n\n2:14:40.680 --> 2:14:44.120\n and I've asked this of Giulio Tononi a couple times\n\n2:14:44.120 --> 2:14:46.600\n back in the 90s and then just a couple years ago.\n\n2:14:46.600 --> 2:14:49.040\n I asked Giulio, okay, so great, integrated information.\n\n2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:51.560\n So we're all interested in explaining\n\n2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:53.200\n some specific conscious experiences.\n\n2:14:53.200 --> 2:14:56.880\n So what is, you know, pick one, the taste of chocolate.\n\n2:14:56.880 --> 2:15:00.860\n What is the integrated information precise structure\n\n2:15:00.860 --> 2:15:03.800\n that we need for chocolate and why does that structure\n\n2:15:03.800 --> 2:15:07.360\n have to be for chocolate and why is it\n\n2:15:07.360 --> 2:15:09.280\n that it could not possibly be vanilla?\n\n2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:11.600\n Is there any, I asked him, is there any one specific\n\n2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:13.520\n conscious experience that you can account for?\n\n2:15:13.520 --> 2:15:18.360\n Because notice, they've set themselves the task\n\n2:15:18.360 --> 2:15:21.440\n of booting up conscious experiences from physical systems.\n\n2:15:21.440 --> 2:15:22.880\n That's the task they've set themselves.\n\n2:15:22.880 --> 2:15:25.440\n But that doesn't mean they're,\n\n2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:26.840\n I understand your intuition,\n\n2:15:26.840 --> 2:15:28.280\n but that doesn't mean they're wrong\n\n2:15:28.280 --> 2:15:31.320\n just because they can't find a way to boot it up yet.\n\n2:15:31.320 --> 2:15:32.160\n That's right.\n\n2:15:32.160 --> 2:15:33.000\n No, that doesn't mean that they're wrong.\n\n2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:37.360\n It just means that they haven't done it.\n\n2:15:37.360 --> 2:15:38.920\n I think it's principled.\n\n2:15:38.920 --> 2:15:40.000\n The reason is principled,\n\n2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:43.060\n but I'm happy that they're exploring it.\n\n2:15:43.060 --> 2:15:45.080\n But the fact is, the remarkable fact is\n\n2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:46.280\n there's not one theory.\n\n2:15:46.280 --> 2:15:48.400\n So integrated information theory,\n\n2:15:49.360 --> 2:15:51.460\n orchestrated collapse of microtubules,\n\n2:15:52.640 --> 2:15:54.800\n global workspace theory.\n\n2:15:54.800 --> 2:15:56.280\n These are all theories of consciousness.\n\n2:15:56.280 --> 2:15:57.720\n These are all theories of consciousness.\n\n2:15:57.720 --> 2:16:01.040\n There's not a single theory that can give you\n\n2:16:01.040 --> 2:16:03.200\n a specific conscious experience that they say,\n\n2:16:03.200 --> 2:16:06.680\n here is the physical dynamics or the physical structure\n\n2:16:06.680 --> 2:16:08.020\n that must be the taste of chocolate\n\n2:16:08.020 --> 2:16:09.120\n or whatever one they want.\n\n2:16:09.120 --> 2:16:11.180\n So you're saying it's impossible.\n\n2:16:11.180 --> 2:16:13.040\n They're saying it's just hard.\n\n2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:14.320\n Yeah.\n\n2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:18.200\n My attitude is, okay, no one said\n\n2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:20.560\n you had to start with neurons or physical systems\n\n2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:21.400\n and boot up consciousness.\n\n2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:22.220\n You guys are just taking that.\n\n2:16:22.220 --> 2:16:23.520\n You chose that problem.\n\n2:16:23.520 --> 2:16:26.080\n So since you chose that problem,\n\n2:16:26.080 --> 2:16:27.320\n how much progress have you made?\n\n2:16:27.320 --> 2:16:30.040\n Well, when you've not been able to come up\n\n2:16:30.040 --> 2:16:32.980\n with a single specific conscious experience\n\n2:16:32.980 --> 2:16:34.520\n and you've had these brilliant people\n\n2:16:34.520 --> 2:16:36.680\n working on it for decades now,\n\n2:16:36.680 --> 2:16:38.360\n that's not really good progress.\n\n2:16:38.360 --> 2:16:41.520\n Let me ask you to play devil's advocate.\n\n2:16:41.520 --> 2:16:46.120\n Can you try to steel man, steel man meaning\n\n2:16:46.120 --> 2:16:49.840\n argue the best possible case for reality?\n\n2:16:49.840 --> 2:16:51.200\n The opposite of your book title.\n\n2:16:51.200 --> 2:16:54.360\n So, or maybe just stick into consciousness.\n\n2:16:54.360 --> 2:16:56.980\n Can you take the physicalist view?\n\n2:16:56.980 --> 2:16:58.780\n Can you steel man the physicalist view\n\n2:16:58.780 --> 2:17:01.760\n for a brief moment playing devil's advocate too?\n\n2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:05.700\n Or steel man the person you used to be?\n\n2:17:05.700 --> 2:17:07.200\n Right, right. She's a physicalist.\n\n2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:10.560\n What's a good, like saying that you might be wrong\n\n2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:15.560\n right now, what would be a convincing argument for that?\n\n2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:21.440\n Well, I think the argument I would give\n\n2:17:21.440 --> 2:17:23.880\n that I believed was, look,\n\n2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:25.920\n when you have very simple physical systems,\n\n2:17:25.920 --> 2:17:28.400\n like a piece of dirt,\n\n2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:30.600\n there's not much evidence of life or consciousness.\n\n2:17:30.600 --> 2:17:32.800\n It's only when you get really complicated physical systems\n\n2:17:32.800 --> 2:17:35.120\n like that have brains and really,\n\n2:17:35.120 --> 2:17:36.400\n the more complicated the brains,\n\n2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:39.240\n the more it looks like there's consciousness\n\n2:17:39.240 --> 2:17:41.200\n and the more complicated that consciousness is.\n\n2:17:41.200 --> 2:17:45.220\n Surely that means that simple physical systems\n\n2:17:45.220 --> 2:17:49.000\n don't create much consciousness or if maybe not any,\n\n2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:50.980\n or maybe panpsychists,\n\n2:17:50.980 --> 2:17:52.320\n they create the most elementary kinds\n\n2:17:52.320 --> 2:17:54.120\n of simple conscious experiences,\n\n2:17:54.120 --> 2:17:59.120\n but you need more complicated physical systems to boot up,\n\n2:17:59.400 --> 2:18:02.020\n to create more complicated consciousnesses.\n\n2:18:02.020 --> 2:18:03.080\n I think that's the intuition\n\n2:18:03.080 --> 2:18:04.920\n that drives most of my colleagues.\n\n2:18:04.920 --> 2:18:09.000\n And you're saying that this concept of complexity\n\n2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:13.760\n is ill defined when you ground it to space time.\n\n2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:15.700\n Oh, I think it's well defined\n\n2:18:15.700 --> 2:18:17.440\n within the framework of space time, right?\n\n2:18:17.440 --> 2:18:21.100\n No, it's ill defined relative to what you need\n\n2:18:21.100 --> 2:18:23.240\n to actually understand consciousness\n\n2:18:23.240 --> 2:18:26.280\n because you're grounding complexity in just in space time.\n\n2:18:26.280 --> 2:18:27.640\n Oh, got you, right, right.\n\n2:18:27.640 --> 2:18:32.520\n Yeah, what I'm saying is if it were true\n\n2:18:33.640 --> 2:18:35.560\n that space time was fundamental,\n\n2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:38.040\n then I would have to agree\n\n2:18:38.040 --> 2:18:40.240\n that if there is such a thing as consciousness,\n\n2:18:40.240 --> 2:18:41.400\n given the data that we've got,\n\n2:18:41.400 --> 2:18:45.880\n that complex brains have consciousness and dirt doesn't,\n\n2:18:45.880 --> 2:18:48.620\n that somehow it's the complexity of the dynamics\n\n2:18:48.620 --> 2:18:52.120\n or organization, the function of the physical system\n\n2:18:52.120 --> 2:18:55.080\n that somehow is creating the consciousness.\n\n2:18:55.080 --> 2:18:58.240\n So under those assumptions, yes,\n\n2:18:58.240 --> 2:19:00.040\n but when the physicists themselves are telling us\n\n2:19:00.040 --> 2:19:03.680\n that space time is not fundamental, then I can understand.\n\n2:19:03.680 --> 2:19:07.000\n See, then the whole picture starts to come into focus.\n\n2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:10.000\n Why, my colleagues are brilliant, right?\n\n2:19:10.960 --> 2:19:12.000\n These are really smart people.\n\n2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:14.080\n I mean, Francis Crick worked on this\n\n2:19:14.080 --> 2:19:15.780\n for the last 20 years of his life.\n\n2:19:16.780 --> 2:19:17.800\n These are not stupid people.\n\n2:19:17.800 --> 2:19:19.680\n These are brilliant, brilliant people.\n\n2:19:19.680 --> 2:19:20.720\n The fact that we've come up\n\n2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:22.980\n with not a single specific conscious experience\n\n2:19:22.980 --> 2:19:25.920\n that we can explain and no hope.\n\n2:19:25.920 --> 2:19:27.480\n There's no one that says, oh, I'm really close.\n\n2:19:27.480 --> 2:19:29.200\n I'll have it for you in a year.\n\n2:19:29.200 --> 2:19:33.280\n No, there's just like, there's this fundamental gap.\n\n2:19:33.280 --> 2:19:36.360\n So much so that Steve Pinker in one of his writings says,\n\n2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:39.860\n look, he likes the global workspace theory,\n\n2:19:39.860 --> 2:19:41.520\n but he says the last dollop of the theory\n\n2:19:41.520 --> 2:19:44.000\n in which there's something it's like to,\n\n2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:47.160\n he says, we may have to just stipulate that as a brute fact.\n\n2:19:50.640 --> 2:19:52.000\n Pinker is brilliant, right?\n\n2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:54.960\n He understands the state of play\n\n2:19:54.960 --> 2:19:57.360\n on this problem of the hard problem of consciousness,\n\n2:19:57.360 --> 2:20:00.880\n starting with physicalist assumptions\n\n2:20:00.880 --> 2:20:02.640\n and then trying to put up consciousness.\n\n2:20:02.640 --> 2:20:04.480\n So you've set yourself the problem.\n\n2:20:04.480 --> 2:20:05.760\n I'm starting with physical stuff\n\n2:20:05.760 --> 2:20:07.880\n that's not conscious.\n\n2:20:07.880 --> 2:20:11.380\n I'm trying to get the taste of chocolate out\n\n2:20:11.380 --> 2:20:14.880\n as maybe some kind of function of the dynamics of that.\n\n2:20:14.880 --> 2:20:16.060\n We've not been able to do that.\n\n2:20:16.060 --> 2:20:18.920\n And so Pinker is saying, we may have to punt.\n\n2:20:18.920 --> 2:20:21.920\n We may have to just stipulate that last bit.\n\n2:20:21.920 --> 2:20:23.840\n He calls it the last dollop.\n\n2:20:23.840 --> 2:20:27.120\n And just stipulate it as a bare fact of nature\n\n2:20:27.120 --> 2:20:28.440\n that there is something it's like.\n\n2:20:28.440 --> 2:20:30.560\n Well, from my point of view as the physical,\n\n2:20:30.560 --> 2:20:33.040\n the whole point, the whole promise of the physicalist\n\n2:20:33.040 --> 2:20:34.520\n was we wouldn't have to stipulate.\n\n2:20:34.520 --> 2:20:36.440\n I was gonna start with the physical stuff\n\n2:20:36.440 --> 2:20:38.800\n and explain where the consciousness came from.\n\n2:20:38.800 --> 2:20:40.680\n If I'm going to stipulate consciousness,\n\n2:20:40.680 --> 2:20:42.600\n why don't I just stipulate consciousness\n\n2:20:42.600 --> 2:20:45.040\n and not stipulate all the physical stuff too?\n\n2:20:45.040 --> 2:20:46.840\n So I'm stipulating less.\n\n2:20:46.840 --> 2:20:47.680\n I'm saying, okay, I agree.\n\n2:20:47.680 --> 2:20:49.520\n Which is the panpsychist perspective.\n\n2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:51.160\n Well, it's actually what I call\n\n2:20:51.160 --> 2:20:52.640\n the conscious realist perspective.\n\n2:20:52.640 --> 2:20:53.760\n Consciousness.\n\n2:20:53.760 --> 2:20:55.880\n Panpsychists are effectively dualists, right?\n\n2:20:55.880 --> 2:20:57.200\n They're saying there's physical stuff\n\n2:20:57.200 --> 2:21:00.040\n that really is fundamental and then consciousness stuff.\n\n2:21:00.040 --> 2:21:01.820\n So I would go with Pinker and say, look,\n\n2:21:01.820 --> 2:21:04.080\n let's just stipulate the consciousness stuff,\n\n2:21:04.080 --> 2:21:05.900\n but I'm not gonna stipulate the physical stuff.\n\n2:21:05.900 --> 2:21:08.080\n I'm gonna actually now show how to boot up\n\n2:21:08.080 --> 2:21:11.120\n the physical stuff from just the consciousness stuff.\n\n2:21:11.120 --> 2:21:12.360\n So I'll stipulate less.\n\n2:21:12.360 --> 2:21:15.180\n Is it possible, so if you stipulate less,\n\n2:21:15.180 --> 2:21:20.180\n is it possible for our limited brains to visualize reality\n\n2:21:22.080 --> 2:21:25.640\n as we delve deeper and deeper and deeper?\n\n2:21:25.640 --> 2:21:27.920\n Is it possible to visualize somehow?\n\n2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:31.000\n With the tools of math, with the tools of computers,\n\n2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:34.600\n with the tools of our mind, are we hopelessly lost?\n\n2:21:34.600 --> 2:21:38.600\n You said there's ways to intuit what's true\n\n2:21:40.480 --> 2:21:44.680\n using mathematics and probability\n\n2:21:44.680 --> 2:21:49.680\n and sort of a Markovian dynamics, all that kind of stuff,\n\n2:21:50.500 --> 2:21:51.920\n but that's not visualizing.\n\n2:21:51.920 --> 2:21:55.880\n That's a kind of building intuition.\n\n2:21:55.880 --> 2:21:57.320\n But is it possible to visualize\n\n2:21:57.320 --> 2:22:00.900\n in the way we visualize so nicely in space time\n\n2:22:00.900 --> 2:22:04.240\n in four dimensions, in three dimensions, sorry.\n\n2:22:04.240 --> 2:22:07.760\n Well, we really are looking through a two dimensional screen\n\n2:22:07.760 --> 2:22:12.720\n until it's what we intuit to be a three dimensional world\n\n2:22:12.720 --> 2:22:17.320\n and also inferring dynamic stuff, making it 4D.\n\n2:22:17.320 --> 2:22:20.520\n Anyway, is it possible to visualize some pretty pictures\n\n2:22:20.520 --> 2:22:25.520\n that give us a deeper sense of the truth of reality?\n\n2:22:25.840 --> 2:22:29.640\n I think that we will incrementally be able to do that.\n\n2:22:29.640 --> 2:22:33.680\n I think that, for example, the picture that we have\n\n2:22:33.680 --> 2:22:38.440\n of electrons and photons interacting and scattering,\n\n2:22:41.680 --> 2:22:43.360\n it may have not been possible\n\n2:22:43.360 --> 2:22:45.320\n until Faraday did all of his experiments\n\n2:22:45.320 --> 2:22:47.280\n and then Maxwell wrote down his equations.\n\n2:22:47.280 --> 2:22:50.160\n And we were then sort of forced by his equations\n\n2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:51.960\n to think in a new way.\n\n2:22:52.920 --> 2:22:56.760\n And then when Planck in 1900,\n\n2:22:56.760 --> 2:23:00.920\n desperate to try to solve the problem\n\n2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:02.240\n of black body radiation,\n\n2:23:02.240 --> 2:23:03.840\n what they call the ultraviolet catastrophe\n\n2:23:03.840 --> 2:23:08.320\n where Newton was predicting infinite energies\n\n2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:09.800\n where there weren't infinite energies\n\n2:23:09.800 --> 2:23:11.480\n in black body radiation.\n\n2:23:11.480 --> 2:23:16.480\n And he in desperation proposed packets of energy.\n\n2:23:20.600 --> 2:23:23.080\n Then once you've done that,\n\n2:23:23.080 --> 2:23:25.280\n and then you have an Einstein come along five years later\n\n2:23:25.280 --> 2:23:29.360\n and show how that explains the photoelectric effect.\n\n2:23:29.360 --> 2:23:33.560\n And then eventually in 1926, you get quantum theory.\n\n2:23:33.560 --> 2:23:35.320\n And then you get this whole new way of thinking\n\n2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:38.380\n that was, from the Newtonian point of view,\n\n2:23:38.380 --> 2:23:43.380\n completely contradictory and counterintuitive, certainly.\n\n2:23:45.400 --> 2:23:47.680\n And maybe if Giesen is right, not contradictory.\n\n2:23:47.680 --> 2:23:50.600\n Maybe if you use intuitionist math, they're not contradictory,\n\n2:23:50.600 --> 2:23:54.440\n but still, certainly you wouldn't have gone there.\n\n2:23:54.440 --> 2:23:57.740\n And so here's a case where the experiments\n\n2:23:57.740 --> 2:24:00.580\n and then a desperate mathematical move,\n\n2:24:01.760 --> 2:24:05.880\n sort of we use those as a flashlight into the deep fog.\n\n2:24:07.160 --> 2:24:12.160\n And so that science may be the flashlight into the deep fog.\n\n2:24:13.800 --> 2:24:16.080\n I wonder if it's still possible to visualize\n\n2:24:16.080 --> 2:24:20.080\n in the, like we talk about consciousness\n\n2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:22.680\n from a self perspective experience it.\n\n2:24:22.680 --> 2:24:25.700\n Hold that idea in our mind,\n\n2:24:25.700 --> 2:24:27.820\n the way you can experience things directly.\n\n2:24:27.820 --> 2:24:32.280\n We've evolved to experience things in this 3D world.\n\n2:24:33.100 --> 2:24:35.960\n And that's a very rich experience.\n\n2:24:35.960 --> 2:24:38.060\n When you're thinking mathematically,\n\n2:24:41.100 --> 2:24:43.820\n you still in the end of the day have to project it down\n\n2:24:44.940 --> 2:24:49.700\n to a low dimensional space to make conclusions.\n\n2:24:49.700 --> 2:24:53.220\n Your conclusions will be a number or a line\n\n2:24:53.220 --> 2:24:56.100\n or a plot or a visual.\n\n2:24:56.100 --> 2:25:00.660\n So I wonder like how we can really touch some deep truth\n\n2:25:00.660 --> 2:25:03.780\n in a subjective way, like experience it,\n\n2:25:03.780 --> 2:25:05.940\n really feel the beauty of it, you know,\n\n2:25:05.940 --> 2:25:08.580\n in the way that humans feel beauty.\n\n2:25:08.580 --> 2:25:10.980\n Right, are we screwed?\n\n2:25:10.980 --> 2:25:11.820\n I don't think we're screwed.\n\n2:25:11.820 --> 2:25:14.460\n I think that we get little hints of it\n\n2:25:14.460 --> 2:25:17.580\n from psychedelic drugs and so forth.\n\n2:25:17.580 --> 2:25:19.700\n We get hints that there are certain interventions\n\n2:25:19.700 --> 2:25:21.460\n that we can take on our interface.\n\n2:25:21.460 --> 2:25:22.740\n I apply this chemical,\n\n2:25:22.740 --> 2:25:25.980\n which is just some element of my interface\n\n2:25:25.980 --> 2:25:29.780\n to this other, to a brain I ingested.\n\n2:25:29.780 --> 2:25:33.500\n And all of a sudden I seem like I've opened new portals\n\n2:25:33.500 --> 2:25:36.380\n into conscious experiences.\n\n2:25:36.380 --> 2:25:38.360\n Well, that's very, very suggestive.\n\n2:25:38.360 --> 2:25:41.540\n That's like the black body radiation doing something\n\n2:25:41.540 --> 2:25:42.740\n that we didn't expect, right?\n\n2:25:42.740 --> 2:25:44.100\n It doesn't go to infinity\n\n2:25:44.100 --> 2:25:45.460\n when we thought it was gonna go to infinity\n\n2:25:45.460 --> 2:25:49.260\n and we're forced to propose these quanta.\n\n2:25:49.260 --> 2:25:52.180\n So once we have a theory of conscious agents\n\n2:25:53.580 --> 2:25:55.260\n and this projection to space,\n\n2:25:55.260 --> 2:25:57.180\n I should say, I should sketch what I think\n\n2:25:57.180 --> 2:25:58.140\n that projection is.\n\n2:25:59.380 --> 2:26:01.820\n But then I think we can then start\n\n2:26:01.820 --> 2:26:03.540\n to ask specific questions.\n\n2:26:03.540 --> 2:26:08.540\n When you're taking DMT or you're taking LSD\n\n2:26:08.780 --> 2:26:10.780\n or something like that,\n\n2:26:10.780 --> 2:26:12.060\n now that we have this deep model\n\n2:26:12.060 --> 2:26:14.620\n that we've reverse engineered space and time\n\n2:26:14.620 --> 2:26:16.200\n and physical particles,\n\n2:26:16.200 --> 2:26:18.620\n we've pulled them back to this theory of conscious agents.\n\n2:26:18.620 --> 2:26:22.080\n Now we can ask ourselves in this idealized future,\n\n2:26:23.380 --> 2:26:25.160\n what are we doing to conscious agents\n\n2:26:25.160 --> 2:26:28.280\n when we apply five MEO DMT?\n\n2:26:28.280 --> 2:26:29.900\n What are we doing?\n\n2:26:29.900 --> 2:26:32.300\n Are we opening a new portal, right?\n\n2:26:32.300 --> 2:26:33.780\n So when I say that, I mean,\n\n2:26:33.780 --> 2:26:35.980\n I have a portal into consciousness\n\n2:26:35.980 --> 2:26:39.260\n that I call my body of Lex Friedman that I'm creating.\n\n2:26:39.260 --> 2:26:41.900\n And it's a genuine portal, not perfect,\n\n2:26:41.900 --> 2:26:43.020\n but it's a genuine portal.\n\n2:26:43.020 --> 2:26:45.940\n I'm definitely communicating with your consciousness.\n\n2:26:45.940 --> 2:26:49.340\n And we know that we have one technology\n\n2:26:49.340 --> 2:26:51.440\n for building new portals.\n\n2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:53.780\n We know one technology and that is having kids.\n\n2:26:54.780 --> 2:26:59.220\n Having kids is how we build new portals into consciousness.\n\n2:26:59.220 --> 2:27:00.100\n It takes a long time.\n\n2:27:00.100 --> 2:27:01.380\n Can you elaborate that?\n\n2:27:01.380 --> 2:27:04.780\n Oh, oh, oh, you mean like?\n\n2:27:04.780 --> 2:27:07.220\n Your son and your daughter didn't exist.\n\n2:27:07.220 --> 2:27:08.300\n That was a portal.\n\n2:27:08.300 --> 2:27:10.460\n You're having contact with consciousness\n\n2:27:10.460 --> 2:27:12.380\n that you never would have had before,\n\n2:27:12.380 --> 2:27:14.100\n but now you've got a son or a daughter.\n\n2:27:14.100 --> 2:27:16.940\n You went through this physical process,\n\n2:27:16.940 --> 2:27:19.980\n they were born, then there was all the training.\n\n2:27:19.980 --> 2:27:22.780\n But is that portal yours?\n\n2:27:22.780 --> 2:27:25.300\n So when you have kids, are you creating new portals\n\n2:27:25.300 --> 2:27:27.300\n that are completely distinct from the portals\n\n2:27:27.300 --> 2:27:29.300\n that you've created with other consciousness?\n\n2:27:29.300 --> 2:27:31.300\n Like can you elaborate on that?\n\n2:27:31.300 --> 2:27:34.500\n To which degree are the consciousness of your kids\n\n2:27:35.380 --> 2:27:36.440\n a part of you?\n\n2:27:37.340 --> 2:27:39.720\n Well, so every person that I see,\n\n2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:43.080\n that symbol that I see, the body that I see,\n\n2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:46.680\n is a portal potentially for me to interact\n\n2:27:46.680 --> 2:27:48.040\n with a consciousness.\n\n2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:53.600\n And each consciousness has a unique character.\n\n2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:56.240\n We call it a personality and so forth.\n\n2:27:56.240 --> 2:27:59.880\n So with each new kid that's born,\n\n2:27:59.880 --> 2:28:01.960\n we come in contact with a personality\n\n2:28:01.960 --> 2:28:03.700\n that we've never seen before.\n\n2:28:03.700 --> 2:28:05.700\n And a version of consciousness\n\n2:28:05.700 --> 2:28:06.960\n that we've never seen before.\n\n2:28:06.960 --> 2:28:08.640\n At a deeper level, as I said,\n\n2:28:08.640 --> 2:28:10.480\n the theory says there's one agent.\n\n2:28:10.480 --> 2:28:15.240\n So this is a different projection of that one agent.\n\n2:28:15.240 --> 2:28:17.960\n But so that's what I mean by a portal\n\n2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:22.960\n is within my own interface, my own projection,\n\n2:28:22.960 --> 2:28:27.960\n can I see other projections of that one consciousness?\n\n2:28:29.760 --> 2:28:31.960\n So can I get portals in that sense?\n\n2:28:31.960 --> 2:28:36.480\n And I think we will get a theory of that,\n\n2:28:36.480 --> 2:28:38.240\n that we will get a theory of portals\n\n2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:41.480\n and then we can ask how the psychedelics are acting.\n\n2:28:41.480 --> 2:28:44.140\n Are they actually creating new portals or not?\n\n2:28:44.140 --> 2:28:47.960\n If they're not, we should nevertheless then understand\n\n2:28:47.960 --> 2:28:50.220\n how we could create a new portal, right?\n\n2:28:50.220 --> 2:28:51.880\n Maybe we have to just study what happens\n\n2:28:51.880 --> 2:28:53.680\n when we have kids.\n\n2:28:53.680 --> 2:28:57.360\n We know that that technology creates new portals.\n\n2:28:57.360 --> 2:28:59.440\n So we have to reverse engineer that and then say,\n\n2:28:59.440 --> 2:29:04.440\n okay, could we somehow create new portals de novo?\n\n2:29:04.440 --> 2:29:09.440\n With something like brain computer interfaces, for example.\n\n2:29:09.440 --> 2:29:10.700\n Yeah, well, maybe just a chemical or something.\n\n2:29:10.700 --> 2:29:12.540\n It's probably more complicated than a chemical.\n\n2:29:12.540 --> 2:29:15.540\n That's why I think that the psychedelics may,\n\n2:29:15.540 --> 2:29:17.460\n because they might be affecting this portal\n\n2:29:17.460 --> 2:29:20.660\n in certain ways that it turns it around and opens up.\n\n2:29:20.660 --> 2:29:22.500\n In other words, maybe once we understand\n\n2:29:22.500 --> 2:29:25.260\n what this thing is a portal, your body is a portal,\n\n2:29:25.260 --> 2:29:26.580\n and understand all of those complexities,\n\n2:29:26.580 --> 2:29:29.180\n maybe we'll realize that that portal can be shifted\n\n2:29:29.180 --> 2:29:32.220\n to different parts of the deeper consciousness\n\n2:29:32.220 --> 2:29:34.420\n and can be used to create new portals.\n\n2:29:34.420 --> 2:29:36.420\n And give new windows on it.\n\n2:29:36.420 --> 2:29:38.860\n And so in that way, maybe yes,\n\n2:29:38.860 --> 2:29:41.180\n psychedelics could open up new portals\n\n2:29:41.180 --> 2:29:42.300\n in the sense that they're taking something\n\n2:29:42.300 --> 2:29:43.740\n that's already a complex portal\n\n2:29:43.740 --> 2:29:45.980\n and just tweaking it a bit.\n\n2:29:45.980 --> 2:29:48.600\n Well, but creating is a very powerful difference\n\n2:29:48.600 --> 2:29:50.540\n between morphing.\n\n2:29:50.540 --> 2:29:52.900\n Right, right, tweaking versus creating, I agree.\n\n2:29:53.900 --> 2:29:55.800\n But maybe it gives you intuition\n\n2:29:55.800 --> 2:29:58.840\n to at least the full space of the kinds of things\n\n2:29:58.840 --> 2:30:01.060\n that this particular system is capable of.\n\n2:30:01.060 --> 2:30:05.100\n I mean, the idea of the consciousness creates brains.\n\n2:30:05.100 --> 2:30:08.540\n I mean, that breaks my brain because,\n\n2:30:08.540 --> 2:30:12.820\n I guess I'm still a physicalist in that sense\n\n2:30:12.820 --> 2:30:17.820\n because it's just much easier to intuit the world.\n\n2:30:19.100 --> 2:30:22.860\n It's practical to think there's a neural network\n\n2:30:22.860 --> 2:30:25.660\n and what are the different ways\n\n2:30:25.660 --> 2:30:30.660\n fascinating capabilities can emerge\n\n2:30:30.660 --> 2:30:32.300\n from this neural network.\n\n2:30:33.420 --> 2:30:34.420\n I agree, it's easier.\n\n2:30:34.420 --> 2:30:36.460\n And so you start to,\n\n2:30:36.460 --> 2:30:38.580\n and then present to yourself the problem of,\n\n2:30:38.580 --> 2:30:40.860\n okay, well, how does consciousness arise?\n\n2:30:40.860 --> 2:30:42.940\n How does intelligence arise?\n\n2:30:42.940 --> 2:30:46.580\n How does emotion arise?\n\n2:30:46.580 --> 2:30:49.820\n How does memory arise?\n\n2:30:49.820 --> 2:30:52.580\n How do we filter within the system\n\n2:30:52.580 --> 2:30:54.980\n all the incoming sensory information\n\n2:30:54.980 --> 2:30:57.660\n we're able to allocate attention\n\n2:30:57.660 --> 2:30:58.760\n in different interesting ways?\n\n2:30:58.760 --> 2:31:00.740\n How do all those mechanisms arise?\n\n2:31:02.060 --> 2:31:04.140\n To say that there's other fundamental things\n\n2:31:04.140 --> 2:31:06.580\n we don't understand outside of space time\n\n2:31:06.580 --> 2:31:10.060\n that are actually core to how this whole thing works\n\n2:31:10.060 --> 2:31:14.140\n is a bit paralyzing because it's like,\n\n2:31:14.140 --> 2:31:19.140\n oh, we're not 10% done, we're like 0.001% done.\n\n2:31:20.740 --> 2:31:23.180\n It's the immediate feeling.\n\n2:31:23.180 --> 2:31:24.420\n Certainly understand that.\n\n2:31:24.420 --> 2:31:26.200\n My attitude about it is,\n\n2:31:26.200 --> 2:31:29.760\n if you look at the young physicists\n\n2:31:29.760 --> 2:31:32.600\n who are searching for these structures beyond space time,\n\n2:31:32.600 --> 2:31:34.460\n like amplitude and so forth,\n\n2:31:36.320 --> 2:31:37.360\n they're having a ball.\n\n2:31:38.360 --> 2:31:41.340\n Space time, that's what the old folks did.\n\n2:31:41.340 --> 2:31:44.280\n That's what the older generation did.\n\n2:31:44.280 --> 2:31:48.520\n We're doing something that really is fun and new\n\n2:31:48.520 --> 2:31:51.880\n and they're having a blast\n\n2:31:51.880 --> 2:31:53.840\n and they're finding all these new structures.\n\n2:31:53.840 --> 2:31:56.840\n So I think that we're going to\n\n2:31:59.040 --> 2:32:03.520\n succeed in getting a new deeper theory.\n\n2:32:03.520 --> 2:32:05.220\n I can just say what I'm hoping with the theory\n\n2:32:05.220 --> 2:32:07.880\n that I'm working on, I'm hoping to show\n\n2:32:07.880 --> 2:32:11.000\n that I could have this timeless dynamics of consciousness,\n\n2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:12.720\n no entropic time.\n\n2:32:12.720 --> 2:32:16.240\n I take a projection and I show how this timeless dynamics\n\n2:32:16.240 --> 2:32:17.680\n looks like the Big Bang\n\n2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:21.840\n and the entire evolution of space time.\n\n2:32:21.840 --> 2:32:25.120\n In other words, I see how my whole space time interface.\n\n2:32:25.120 --> 2:32:28.000\n So not just the projection\n\n2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:29.760\n doesn't just look like space time,\n\n2:32:29.760 --> 2:32:34.440\n you can explain the whole from the origin of the universe.\n\n2:32:34.440 --> 2:32:35.720\n That's what we have to do\n\n2:32:35.720 --> 2:32:37.060\n and that's what the physicists understand.\n\n2:32:37.060 --> 2:32:39.200\n When they go beyond space time to the amplitude heat\n\n2:32:39.200 --> 2:32:41.000\n and the cosmological polytope,\n\n2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:43.200\n they ultimately know that they have to get back\n\n2:32:43.200 --> 2:32:46.600\n the Big Bang story and the whole evolution,\n\n2:32:46.600 --> 2:32:49.380\n that whole story where there were no living things.\n\n2:32:49.380 --> 2:32:53.680\n There was just a point and then the explosion\n\n2:32:53.680 --> 2:32:55.600\n and then just particles at high energy\n\n2:32:55.600 --> 2:32:57.040\n and then eventually the cooling down\n\n2:32:57.040 --> 2:33:01.800\n and the differentiation and finally matter condenses\n\n2:33:01.800 --> 2:33:03.520\n and then life and then consciousness.\n\n2:33:03.520 --> 2:33:05.800\n That whole story has to come out of something\n\n2:33:05.800 --> 2:33:07.840\n that's deeper and without time.\n\n2:33:07.840 --> 2:33:09.680\n And that's what we're up to.\n\n2:33:12.040 --> 2:33:14.480\n So the whole story that we've been telling ourselves\n\n2:33:14.480 --> 2:33:17.140\n about Big Bang and how brains evolved in consciousness\n\n2:33:17.140 --> 2:33:18.720\n will come out of a much deeper theory.\n\n2:33:18.720 --> 2:33:23.520\n And yeah, for someone like me, it's a lot.\n\n2:33:24.680 --> 2:33:28.320\n But for the younger generation, this is like, oh wow,\n\n2:33:29.480 --> 2:33:30.760\n all the low cherries aren't picked.\n\n2:33:30.760 --> 2:33:31.900\n This is really good stuff.\n\n2:33:31.900 --> 2:33:35.400\n This is really new fundamental stuff that we can do.\n\n2:33:35.400 --> 2:33:40.120\n So I can't wait to read the papers of the younger generation\n\n2:33:40.120 --> 2:33:41.940\n and I wanna see them.\n\n2:33:41.940 --> 2:33:46.940\n Kids these days with their non space time assumptions.\n\n2:33:48.980 --> 2:33:51.660\n It's just interesting looking at the philosophical tradition\n\n2:33:51.660 --> 2:33:53.780\n of this difficult ideas you struggle with.\n\n2:33:53.780 --> 2:33:57.680\n If you look like somebody like Emmanuel Kant,\n\n2:33:57.680 --> 2:34:00.300\n what are some interesting agreements and disagreements\n\n2:34:00.300 --> 2:34:04.900\n you have with a guy about the nature of reality?\n\n2:34:04.900 --> 2:34:06.880\n So there's a lot in agreement, right?\n\n2:34:06.880 --> 2:34:10.960\n So Kant was an idealist, transcendental idealist\n\n2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:15.180\n and he basically had the idea\n\n2:34:15.180 --> 2:34:19.340\n that we don't see nature as it is.\n\n2:34:19.340 --> 2:34:21.160\n We impose a structure on nature.\n\n2:34:26.020 --> 2:34:29.060\n And so in some sense, I'm saying something similar.\n\n2:34:29.060 --> 2:34:30.540\n I'm saying that, by the way,\n\n2:34:30.540 --> 2:34:31.660\n I don't call myself an idealist.\n\n2:34:31.660 --> 2:34:33.500\n I call myself a conscious realist\n\n2:34:33.500 --> 2:34:35.620\n because idealism has a long history.\n\n2:34:35.620 --> 2:34:38.420\n A lot of different ideas come under idealism\n\n2:34:38.420 --> 2:34:40.620\n and there's a lot of debates and so forth.\n\n2:34:40.620 --> 2:34:44.540\n It tends to be identified with, in many cases,\n\n2:34:44.540 --> 2:34:46.660\n anti science and anti realism.\n\n2:34:46.660 --> 2:34:49.380\n And I don't want either connection with my ideas\n\n2:34:49.380 --> 2:34:51.540\n and so I just called mine conscious realism\n\n2:34:51.540 --> 2:34:55.460\n with an emphasis on realism and not anti realism.\n\n2:34:56.440 --> 2:34:58.900\n But one place where I would, of course,\n\n2:34:58.900 --> 2:35:00.300\n disagree with Kant was that he thought\n\n2:35:00.300 --> 2:35:05.300\n that Euclidean space time was a priori, right?\n\n2:35:05.560 --> 2:35:07.220\n We just know that that's false.\n\n2:35:07.220 --> 2:35:11.780\n So he went too far on that.\n\n2:35:11.780 --> 2:35:16.220\n But in general, the idea that we don't start with space time,\n\n2:35:16.220 --> 2:35:17.740\n that space and time is in some sense\n\n2:35:17.740 --> 2:35:19.240\n the forms of our perceptions.\n\n2:35:19.240 --> 2:35:20.420\n Yes, absolutely.\n\n2:35:21.540 --> 2:35:25.660\n And I would say that there's a lot in common\n\n2:35:25.660 --> 2:35:27.300\n with Berkeley in that regard.\n\n2:35:28.820 --> 2:35:31.740\n There's a lot of ingenious arguments in Berkeley.\n\n2:35:31.740 --> 2:35:36.740\n Leibniz in his monodology understood very clearly\n\n2:35:36.740 --> 2:35:38.860\n that the hard problem was not solvable.\n\n2:35:38.860 --> 2:35:41.900\n He posed the hard problem and basically dismissed it.\n\n2:35:41.900 --> 2:35:43.740\n He just said, you can't do this.\n\n2:35:43.740 --> 2:35:47.100\n And so if he came here and saw where we are,\n\n2:35:47.100 --> 2:35:50.100\n he said, look, guys, I told you this 300 years ago.\n\n2:35:50.100 --> 2:35:51.300\n And he had his monodology.\n\n2:35:51.300 --> 2:35:53.900\n He was trying to do something like,\n\n2:35:53.900 --> 2:35:56.980\n it's different from what I'm doing,\n\n2:35:56.980 --> 2:35:59.100\n but he had these things that were not in space and time,\n\n2:35:59.100 --> 2:36:00.420\n these monads.\n\n2:36:00.420 --> 2:36:02.220\n He was trying to build something.\n\n2:36:03.300 --> 2:36:05.300\n I'm trying to build a theory of conscious agents.\n\n2:36:05.300 --> 2:36:08.460\n My guess is that if he came here,\n\n2:36:08.460 --> 2:36:10.500\n I could just, if he saw what I was doing,\n\n2:36:10.500 --> 2:36:13.100\n he would say, he would understand it\n\n2:36:13.100 --> 2:36:15.300\n and immediately take off with it\n\n2:36:15.300 --> 2:36:17.500\n and go places that I couldn't.\n\n2:36:17.500 --> 2:36:19.780\n He would have no problem with this.\n\n2:36:19.780 --> 2:36:22.860\n Right, there would be overlap of the spirit\n\n2:36:22.860 --> 2:36:25.460\n of the ideas would be totally overlapping.\n\n2:36:25.460 --> 2:36:26.860\n But his genius would then just run with it\n\n2:36:26.860 --> 2:36:28.060\n far faster than I could.\n\n2:36:28.060 --> 2:36:29.820\n I love the humility here.\n\n2:36:29.820 --> 2:36:32.620\n So let me ask you about sort of practical implications\n\n2:36:32.620 --> 2:36:36.460\n of your ideas to our world, our complicated world.\n\n2:36:36.460 --> 2:36:38.780\n When you look at the big questions of humanity,\n\n2:36:38.780 --> 2:36:43.780\n of hate, war, what else is there?\n\n2:36:46.820 --> 2:36:51.500\n Evil, maybe there's the positive aspects of that,\n\n2:36:51.500 --> 2:36:53.380\n of meaning, of love.\n\n2:36:54.700 --> 2:36:59.700\n What is the fact that reality is an illusion perceived?\n\n2:36:59.700 --> 2:37:04.700\n What is the conscious realism when applied to daily life?\n\n2:37:07.500 --> 2:37:09.300\n What kind of impact does it have?\n\n2:37:09.300 --> 2:37:12.320\n A lot, and it's sort of scary.\n\n2:37:15.460 --> 2:37:17.260\n We all know that life is ephemeral\n\n2:37:18.300 --> 2:37:21.060\n and spiritual traditions have said wake up to the fact\n\n2:37:21.060 --> 2:37:24.500\n that anything that you do here is going to disappear.\n\n2:37:24.500 --> 2:37:27.960\n But it's even more ephemeral than perhaps we've thought.\n\n2:37:27.960 --> 2:37:30.900\n I see this bottle because I create it right now.\n\n2:37:30.900 --> 2:37:33.660\n As soon as I look away,\n\n2:37:33.660 --> 2:37:36.060\n that data structure has been garbage collected.\n\n2:37:36.060 --> 2:37:38.860\n That bottle, I have to recreate it every time I look.\n\n2:37:38.860 --> 2:37:41.260\n So I spend all my money and I buy this fancy car.\n\n2:37:42.220 --> 2:37:44.380\n That car, I have to keep recreating it\n\n2:37:44.380 --> 2:37:45.200\n every time I look at it.\n\n2:37:45.200 --> 2:37:46.540\n It's that ephemeral.\n\n2:37:46.540 --> 2:37:50.200\n So all the things that we invest ourselves in,\n\n2:37:50.200 --> 2:37:52.300\n we fight over, we kill each other over,\n\n2:37:52.300 --> 2:37:55.820\n we have wars over, these are all,\n\n2:37:55.820 --> 2:37:59.420\n it's like people in a virtual reality simulation, right?\n\n2:37:59.420 --> 2:38:03.800\n And there's this Porsche and we all see the Porsche.\n\n2:38:03.800 --> 2:38:07.100\n Well, that Porsche exists when I look at it.\n\n2:38:07.100 --> 2:38:09.080\n I turn my headset and I look at it.\n\n2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:12.220\n And then if Joe turns his headset the right way,\n\n2:38:12.220 --> 2:38:13.260\n he'll see his Porsche.\n\n2:38:13.260 --> 2:38:15.260\n It's not even the same Porsche that I see.\n\n2:38:15.260 --> 2:38:16.760\n He's creating his own Porsche.\n\n2:38:17.780 --> 2:38:20.460\n So these things are exceedingly ephemeral.\n\n2:38:20.460 --> 2:38:25.460\n And now just imagine saying that that's my Porsche.\n\n2:38:25.460 --> 2:38:29.380\n Well, you can agree to say that it's your Porsche,\n\n2:38:29.380 --> 2:38:32.900\n but really the Porsche only exists as long as you look.\n\n2:38:32.900 --> 2:38:34.640\n So this all of a sudden,\n\n2:38:34.640 --> 2:38:36.600\n what the spiritual traditions have been saying\n\n2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:38.220\n for a long, long time,\n\n2:38:38.220 --> 2:38:41.380\n this gets cashed out in mathematically precise science.\n\n2:38:41.380 --> 2:38:43.380\n It's saying ephemeral, yes.\n\n2:38:43.380 --> 2:38:45.900\n In fact, it lasts for a few milliseconds,\n\n2:38:45.900 --> 2:38:47.460\n a few hundred milliseconds while you look at it.\n\n2:38:47.460 --> 2:38:48.740\n And then it's gone.\n\n2:38:48.740 --> 2:38:53.740\n So the whole idea, why are we fighting?\n\n2:38:53.740 --> 2:38:55.100\n Why do we hate?\n\n2:38:57.740 --> 2:38:59.820\n We fight over possessions\n\n2:39:01.660 --> 2:39:05.200\n because we think that we're small little objects\n\n2:39:05.200 --> 2:39:07.820\n inside this preexisting space time.\n\n2:39:07.820 --> 2:39:11.220\n We assume that that mansion and that car\n\n2:39:11.220 --> 2:39:12.980\n exists independent of us.\n\n2:39:12.980 --> 2:39:16.060\n And that somehow we, these little things\n\n2:39:16.060 --> 2:39:19.540\n can have our sense of self and importance\n\n2:39:19.540 --> 2:39:21.060\n enhanced by having that special car\n\n2:39:21.060 --> 2:39:23.720\n or that special house or that special person.\n\n2:39:23.720 --> 2:39:26.980\n When in fact, it's just the opposite.\n\n2:39:26.980 --> 2:39:29.540\n You create that mansion every time you look.\n\n2:39:29.540 --> 2:39:32.980\n That's, you're something far deeper than that mansion.\n\n2:39:32.980 --> 2:39:37.140\n You're the entity which can create that mansion on the fly.\n\n2:39:37.140 --> 2:39:39.860\n And there's nothing to the mansion\n\n2:39:39.860 --> 2:39:41.660\n except what you create in this moment.\n\n2:39:41.660 --> 2:39:45.600\n So all of a sudden, when you take this point of view,\n\n2:39:46.780 --> 2:39:49.540\n it has all sorts of implications\n\n2:39:49.540 --> 2:39:51.620\n for how we interact with each other,\n\n2:39:51.620 --> 2:39:53.880\n how we treat each other.\n\n2:39:57.260 --> 2:39:58.740\n And again, a lot of things\n\n2:39:58.740 --> 2:40:02.500\n that spiritual traditions have said, it's a mixed bag.\n\n2:40:02.500 --> 2:40:03.740\n Spiritual traditions are a mixed bag.\n\n2:40:03.740 --> 2:40:05.100\n So let me just be right up front about that.\n\n2:40:05.100 --> 2:40:06.780\n I'm not promoting any particular,\n\n2:40:06.780 --> 2:40:08.380\n but they do have some insights.\n\n2:40:08.380 --> 2:40:09.540\n Yeah, they have wisdom.\n\n2:40:09.540 --> 2:40:10.460\n They have certain wisdom.\n\n2:40:10.460 --> 2:40:12.220\n They have, I can point to nonsense.\n\n2:40:12.220 --> 2:40:13.060\n I won't go into it,\n\n2:40:13.060 --> 2:40:14.500\n but I can also point to lots of nonsense.\n\n2:40:14.500 --> 2:40:19.340\n So the issue is to then to look for the key insights.\n\n2:40:19.340 --> 2:40:21.620\n And I think they have a lot of insights\n\n2:40:21.620 --> 2:40:25.580\n about the ephemeral nature of objects in space and time\n\n2:40:25.580 --> 2:40:28.820\n and not being attached to them, including our own bodies.\n\n2:40:28.820 --> 2:40:31.680\n And reversing that I'm not this little thing,\n\n2:40:31.680 --> 2:40:33.700\n a little consciousness trapped in the body.\n\n2:40:33.700 --> 2:40:36.080\n And the consciousness itself is only a product of the body.\n\n2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:38.900\n So when the body dies, the consciousness disappears.\n\n2:40:38.900 --> 2:40:40.700\n It turns completely around.\n\n2:40:40.700 --> 2:40:42.360\n The consciousness is fundamental.\n\n2:40:42.360 --> 2:40:46.420\n The body, my hand exists right now\n\n2:40:46.420 --> 2:40:47.940\n because I'm looking at it.\n\n2:40:47.940 --> 2:40:49.780\n My hand is gone.\n\n2:40:49.780 --> 2:40:50.660\n I have no hand.\n\n2:40:50.660 --> 2:40:52.140\n I have no brain.\n\n2:40:52.140 --> 2:40:53.220\n I have no heart.\n\n2:40:53.220 --> 2:40:55.400\n If you looked, you'll see a heart.\n\n2:40:55.400 --> 2:41:00.100\n Whatever I am is this really complicated thing\n\n2:41:00.100 --> 2:41:01.240\n in consciousness.\n\n2:41:01.240 --> 2:41:02.420\n That's what I am.\n\n2:41:03.280 --> 2:41:05.660\n All the stuff that I thought I was\n\n2:41:05.660 --> 2:41:07.580\n is something that I create on the fly and delete.\n\n2:41:07.580 --> 2:41:11.940\n So this is completely radical restructuring\n\n2:41:11.940 --> 2:41:16.940\n of how we think about possessions, about identity,\n\n2:41:16.940 --> 2:41:20.420\n about survival of death and so forth.\n\n2:41:20.420 --> 2:41:22.740\n This is completely transformative.\n\n2:41:22.740 --> 2:41:24.860\n But the nice thing is that this whole approach\n\n2:41:24.860 --> 2:41:27.660\n of conscious agents, unlike the spiritual traditions,\n\n2:41:27.660 --> 2:41:30.660\n which have said in some cases similar things,\n\n2:41:30.660 --> 2:41:32.020\n they've said it imprecisely.\n\n2:41:33.180 --> 2:41:34.900\n This is mathematics.\n\n2:41:34.900 --> 2:41:38.260\n We can actually now begin to state precisely,\n\n2:41:38.260 --> 2:41:40.140\n here's the mathematical model of consciousness,\n\n2:41:40.140 --> 2:41:42.400\n conscious agents, here's how it maps onto space time,\n\n2:41:42.400 --> 2:41:44.620\n which I should sketch really briefly.\n\n2:41:44.620 --> 2:41:49.620\n And here's why things are ephemeral\n\n2:41:50.380 --> 2:41:52.700\n and here's why you shouldn't be worried\n\n2:41:52.700 --> 2:41:54.060\n about the ephemeral nature of things\n\n2:41:54.060 --> 2:41:57.340\n because you're not a little tiny entity\n\n2:41:57.340 --> 2:41:59.940\n inside space and time, quite the opposite.\n\n2:41:59.940 --> 2:42:02.280\n You're the author of space and time.\n\n2:42:02.280 --> 2:42:04.700\n The I and the am and the I am\n\n2:42:04.700 --> 2:42:07.300\n is all kind of emerging through this whole process\n\n2:42:07.300 --> 2:42:12.300\n of evolution and so on that's just surface waves\n\n2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:13.740\n and there's a much deeper ocean\n\n2:42:13.740 --> 2:42:15.300\n that we're trying to figure out here.\n\n2:42:15.300 --> 2:42:18.220\n So how does, you said some of the stuff\n\n2:42:18.220 --> 2:42:19.860\n you're thinking about maps to space time,\n\n2:42:19.860 --> 2:42:21.500\n how does it map to space time?\n\n2:42:21.500 --> 2:42:25.240\n So just a very, very high level and I'll keep it brief.\n\n2:42:25.240 --> 2:42:28.180\n The structures that the physicists are finding,\n\n2:42:28.180 --> 2:42:31.100\n like the amplituhedron, it turns out\n\n2:42:31.100 --> 2:42:34.340\n they're just static structure, they're polytopes.\n\n2:42:34.340 --> 2:42:37.940\n But they, remarkably, most of the information in them\n\n2:42:37.940 --> 2:42:40.480\n is contained in permutation matrices.\n\n2:42:40.480 --> 2:42:45.480\n So it's a matrix, like an end by end matrix\n\n2:42:45.720 --> 2:42:47.160\n that just has zeros and ones.\n\n2:42:49.520 --> 2:42:51.920\n That contains almost all of the information\n\n2:42:51.920 --> 2:42:54.160\n and you can, they have these plebic graphs\n\n2:42:54.160 --> 2:42:56.800\n and so forth that they use to boot up the scattering.\n\n2:42:56.800 --> 2:42:59.000\n You can compute those scattering amplitudes\n\n2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:02.120\n almost entirely from these permutation matrices.\n\n2:43:03.560 --> 2:43:07.200\n So that's just, now from my point of view,\n\n2:43:07.200 --> 2:43:09.360\n I have this conscious agent dynamics.\n\n2:43:09.360 --> 2:43:12.020\n It turns out that the stationary dynamics\n\n2:43:12.020 --> 2:43:13.720\n that I was talking about,\n\n2:43:13.720 --> 2:43:15.880\n where the entropy isn't increasing,\n\n2:43:15.880 --> 2:43:19.720\n all the stationary dynamics are sketched out\n\n2:43:19.720 --> 2:43:22.420\n by permutation matrices.\n\n2:43:24.200 --> 2:43:27.680\n So there's so called Burkhoff polytope.\n\n2:43:27.680 --> 2:43:29.800\n All the vertices of this polytope,\n\n2:43:29.800 --> 2:43:33.280\n all the points are permutation matrices.\n\n2:43:33.280 --> 2:43:37.440\n All the internal points are Markovian kernels\n\n2:43:37.440 --> 2:43:42.440\n that have the uniform measure as a stationary measure.\n\n2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:44.320\n Now I need to intuit a little better\n\n2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:46.000\n what the heck you're talking about.\n\n2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:50.680\n So basically, there's some complicated thing\n\n2:43:50.680 --> 2:43:54.560\n going on with the network of conscious agents\n\n2:43:54.560 --> 2:43:56.560\n and that's mappable to this,\n\n2:43:56.560 --> 2:43:58.560\n you're saying a two dimensional matrix\n\n2:43:58.560 --> 2:44:02.040\n that scattering has to do with what?\n\n2:44:02.040 --> 2:44:05.320\n With our perception, like that's like photon stuff?\n\n2:44:05.320 --> 2:44:06.520\n I mean, I don't know if it's useful\n\n2:44:06.520 --> 2:44:09.640\n to sort of dig into detail.\n\n2:44:09.640 --> 2:44:11.000\n I'll do just the high level thing.\n\n2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:11.880\n Yes.\n\n2:44:11.880 --> 2:44:15.520\n So the high level is the long term behavior\n\n2:44:15.520 --> 2:44:17.000\n of the conscious agent dynamics.\n\n2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:18.380\n So that's the projection of just looking\n\n2:44:18.380 --> 2:44:19.800\n at the long term behavior.\n\n2:44:20.680 --> 2:44:23.820\n I'm hoping we'll give rise to the amplituhedron.\n\n2:44:23.820 --> 2:44:27.720\n The amplituhedron then gives rise to space time.\n\n2:44:27.720 --> 2:44:29.860\n So then I can just use their link\n\n2:44:29.860 --> 2:44:31.140\n to go all the way from consciousness\n\n2:44:31.140 --> 2:44:33.440\n through its asymptotics to,\n\n2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:35.280\n through the amplituhedron into space time\n\n2:44:35.280 --> 2:44:37.880\n and get the map all the way into our interface.\n\n2:44:37.880 --> 2:44:39.640\n And that's why you mentioned the permutation matrix\n\n2:44:39.640 --> 2:44:42.440\n because it gives you a nice thing to try to generate.\n\n2:44:42.440 --> 2:44:44.480\n That's right, it's the connection with the amplituhedron.\n\n2:44:44.480 --> 2:44:47.440\n The permutation matrices are the core of the amplituhedron\n\n2:44:47.440 --> 2:44:49.120\n and it turns out they're the core\n\n2:44:49.120 --> 2:44:52.280\n of the asymptotic description of the conscious agents.\n\n2:44:52.280 --> 2:44:54.820\n So not to sort of bring up the idea of a creator,\n\n2:44:54.820 --> 2:44:57.840\n but I like, first of all, I like video games\n\n2:44:57.840 --> 2:45:01.140\n and you mentioned this kind of simulation idea.\n\n2:45:01.140 --> 2:45:03.120\n First of all, do you think of it as an interesting idea,\n\n2:45:03.120 --> 2:45:06.440\n this thought experiment that will live in a simulation?\n\n2:45:06.440 --> 2:45:09.520\n And in general, do you think we'll live in a simulation?\n\n2:45:10.400 --> 2:45:14.320\n So the Nick Bostrom's idea about the simulation\n\n2:45:14.320 --> 2:45:17.920\n is typically couched in a physicalist framework.\n\n2:45:17.920 --> 2:45:18.840\n Yes.\n\n2:45:18.840 --> 2:45:21.000\n So there is the bottom level,\n\n2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:24.280\n there's some programmer in a physical space time\n\n2:45:24.280 --> 2:45:25.760\n and they have a computer that they've programmed\n\n2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:29.740\n really cleverly where they've created conscious entities.\n\n2:45:30.600 --> 2:45:32.720\n So you have the hard problem of consciousness, right?\n\n2:45:32.720 --> 2:45:33.560\n The standard hard problem.\n\n2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:36.680\n How could a computer simulation create a conscious,\n\n2:45:36.680 --> 2:45:39.120\n which isn't explained by that simulation theory.\n\n2:45:39.120 --> 2:45:41.120\n But then the idea is that the next level,\n\n2:45:41.120 --> 2:45:46.120\n the entities that are created in the first level simulation\n\n2:45:46.680 --> 2:45:48.120\n then can write their own simulations\n\n2:45:48.120 --> 2:45:49.440\n and you get this nesting.\n\n2:45:50.440 --> 2:45:55.440\n So the idea that this is a simulation is fine,\n\n2:45:55.780 --> 2:45:58.600\n but the idea that it starts with a physicalist base,\n\n2:45:58.600 --> 2:46:00.120\n I think, isn't fine.\n\n2:46:00.120 --> 2:46:01.880\n Well, there's different properties here.\n\n2:46:01.880 --> 2:46:06.880\n The partial rendering, and to me that's the interesting idea\n\n2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:11.360\n is not whether the entirety of the universe is simulated,\n\n2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:15.360\n but how efficiently can you create interfaces\n\n2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:21.840\n that are convincing to all other entities\n\n2:46:21.840 --> 2:46:24.080\n that can appreciate such interfaces?\n\n2:46:24.080 --> 2:46:25.920\n How little does it take?\n\n2:46:25.920 --> 2:46:27.920\n Because you said like partial rendering\n\n2:46:27.920 --> 2:46:31.800\n or like temporal, ephemeral rendering of stuff.\n\n2:46:31.800 --> 2:46:33.920\n Only render the tree falling in the forest\n\n2:46:33.920 --> 2:46:36.340\n when there's somebody there to see it.\n\n2:46:36.340 --> 2:46:38.240\n It's interesting to think,\n\n2:46:38.240 --> 2:46:39.760\n how can you do that super efficiently\n\n2:46:39.760 --> 2:46:41.360\n without having to render everything?\n\n2:46:41.360 --> 2:46:44.440\n And that to me is one perspective on the simulation,\n\n2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:46.720\n just like it is with video games,\n\n2:46:46.720 --> 2:46:48.240\n where a video game doesn't have to render\n\n2:46:48.240 --> 2:46:49.480\n every single thing.\n\n2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:52.300\n It's just the thing that the observer is looking at.\n\n2:46:52.300 --> 2:46:55.600\n Right, there is actually, that's a very nice question.\n\n2:46:55.600 --> 2:46:58.080\n And there's whole groups of researchers\n\n2:46:58.080 --> 2:47:00.660\n that are actually studying in virtual reality,\n\n2:47:00.660 --> 2:47:05.660\n what is the sort of minimal requirements on the system?\n\n2:47:06.360 --> 2:47:07.760\n How does it have to operate\n\n2:47:07.760 --> 2:47:09.840\n to give you an immersion experience,\n\n2:47:09.840 --> 2:47:12.600\n to give you the feeling that you have a body,\n\n2:47:12.600 --> 2:47:14.240\n to get you to take it real?\n\n2:47:14.240 --> 2:47:15.960\n And there's actually a lot of really good work\n\n2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:16.800\n on that right now.\n\n2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:18.160\n And it turns out it doesn't take that much.\n\n2:47:18.160 --> 2:47:21.600\n You do need to get the perception action loop tight\n\n2:47:21.600 --> 2:47:25.080\n and you have to give them the perceptions\n\n2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:26.960\n that they're expecting if you want them to.\n\n2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:30.080\n But if you can lead them along,\n\n2:47:30.080 --> 2:47:31.160\n if you give them perceptions\n\n2:47:31.160 --> 2:47:32.320\n that are close to what they're expecting,\n\n2:47:32.320 --> 2:47:35.480\n you can then maybe move their reality around a bit.\n\n2:47:35.480 --> 2:47:36.960\n Yeah, it's a tricky engineering problem,\n\n2:47:36.960 --> 2:47:39.340\n especially when you're trying to create a product\n\n2:47:39.340 --> 2:47:41.240\n that costs little, but that's,\n\n2:47:41.240 --> 2:47:43.000\n it feels like an engineering problem,\n\n2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:44.600\n not a deeply scientific problem.\n\n2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:47.660\n Or meaning, obviously it's a scientific problem,\n\n2:47:47.660 --> 2:47:49.040\n but as a scientific problem,\n\n2:47:49.040 --> 2:47:53.320\n it's not that difficult to trick us descendants of apes.\n\n2:47:53.320 --> 2:47:56.440\n But here's a case for just us, you know, our own,\n\n2:47:56.440 --> 2:47:57.520\n if this is a virtual reality\n\n2:47:57.520 --> 2:47:58.520\n that we're experiencing right now.\n\n2:47:58.520 --> 2:48:01.680\n So here's something you can try for yourself.\n\n2:48:01.680 --> 2:48:03.040\n If you just close your eyes\n\n2:48:04.600 --> 2:48:08.720\n and look at your experience in front of you,\n\n2:48:08.720 --> 2:48:09.880\n be aware of your experience in front of you,\n\n2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:14.000\n what you experience is just like a modeled dark gray,\n\n2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:15.920\n where there's all sort of, there's some dynamics to it,\n\n2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:17.620\n but it's just dark gray.\n\n2:48:17.620 --> 2:48:21.740\n But now I ask you, instead of having your attention forward,\n\n2:48:22.620 --> 2:48:24.320\n put your attention backward.\n\n2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:29.320\n What is it like behind you with your eyes closed?\n\n2:48:29.840 --> 2:48:32.600\n And there, it's like nothing.\n\n2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:35.420\n It's real.\n\n2:48:35.420 --> 2:48:37.920\n So what is going on here?\n\n2:48:37.920 --> 2:48:41.640\n What am I experiencing back there?\n\n2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:44.960\n Right?\n\n2:48:44.960 --> 2:48:47.160\n Well, it's, I don't know if it's nothing.\n\n2:48:47.160 --> 2:48:49.800\n It's like, I guess it's the absence of,\n\n2:48:49.800 --> 2:48:51.800\n it's not even like darkness or something.\n\n2:48:51.800 --> 2:48:53.560\n It's not even darkness.\n\n2:48:53.560 --> 2:48:58.560\n There's no qualia to it.\n\n2:48:58.680 --> 2:49:01.160\n And yet there is a sense of being.\n\n2:49:01.160 --> 2:49:02.080\n And that's the interesting thing.\n\n2:49:02.080 --> 2:49:03.580\n There's a sense of being back.\n\n2:49:03.580 --> 2:49:06.760\n So I close my, when I put my attention forward,\n\n2:49:06.760 --> 2:49:08.900\n I have the qualia of a gray model thing.\n\n2:49:08.900 --> 2:49:10.380\n But when I put my attention backward,\n\n2:49:10.380 --> 2:49:13.440\n there's no qualia at all, but there is a sense of being.\n\n2:49:13.440 --> 2:49:14.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:49:14.400 --> 2:49:18.560\n I personally, now you haven't been to that side of the room.\n\n2:49:18.560 --> 2:49:20.040\n I have been to that side of the room.\n\n2:49:20.040 --> 2:49:25.040\n So for me, memories, I start playing the engine\n\n2:49:25.560 --> 2:49:29.680\n of memory replay, which is like,\n\n2:49:29.680 --> 2:49:32.880\n I take myself back in time and think about that place\n\n2:49:32.880 --> 2:49:34.560\n where I was hanging out in that part.\n\n2:49:34.560 --> 2:49:35.800\n That's where I see what I'm behind.\n\n2:49:35.800 --> 2:49:38.720\n So that's an interesting quirk of humans too,\n\n2:49:38.720 --> 2:49:41.200\n we're able to, we're collecting these experiences\n\n2:49:41.200 --> 2:49:43.080\n and we can replay them in interesting ways\n\n2:49:43.080 --> 2:49:44.320\n whenever we feel like it.\n\n2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:46.640\n And it's almost like being there,\n\n2:49:46.640 --> 2:49:49.160\n but not really, but almost.\n\n2:49:49.160 --> 2:49:50.480\n That's right.\n\n2:49:50.480 --> 2:49:53.160\n And yet we can go our entire lives in this.\n\n2:49:53.160 --> 2:49:54.720\n You're talking about the minimal thing for VR.\n\n2:49:54.720 --> 2:49:56.720\n We can go our entire lives and not realize\n\n2:49:56.720 --> 2:50:01.720\n that all of my life, it's been like nothing behind me.\n\n2:50:01.720 --> 2:50:03.600\n Yeah, right.\n\n2:50:03.600 --> 2:50:06.280\n We're not even aware that all of our lives,\n\n2:50:06.280 --> 2:50:10.640\n if you just pay attention to us behind me,\n\n2:50:10.640 --> 2:50:13.280\n we're like, oh, holy smoke, it's totally scary.\n\n2:50:13.280 --> 2:50:14.720\n I mean, it's like nothing.\n\n2:50:14.720 --> 2:50:16.120\n There's no qualia there at all.\n\n2:50:16.120 --> 2:50:18.360\n How did I not notice that my entire life?\n\n2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:21.280\n We're so immersed in the simulation, we buy it so much.\n\n2:50:21.280 --> 2:50:24.840\n Yeah, I mean, you could see this with children, right?\n\n2:50:24.840 --> 2:50:28.400\n Though with persistence, you could do the peekaboo game.\n\n2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:32.040\n You can hide from them and appear and they're fully tricked.\n\n2:50:32.040 --> 2:50:34.760\n And in the same way, we're fully tricked.\n\n2:50:34.760 --> 2:50:37.800\n There's nothing behind us and we assume there is.\n\n2:50:37.800 --> 2:50:39.320\n And that's really interesting.\n\n2:50:39.320 --> 2:50:41.240\n These theories are pretty heavy.\n\n2:50:42.320 --> 2:50:46.640\n You as a human being, as a mortal human being,\n\n2:50:46.640 --> 2:50:49.920\n how has these theories been to you personally?\n\n2:50:49.920 --> 2:50:51.720\n Like, are there good days and bad days\n\n2:50:51.720 --> 2:50:54.120\n when you wake up and look in the mirror\n\n2:50:54.120 --> 2:50:57.760\n and the fact that you can't see anything behind you?\n\n2:50:57.760 --> 2:50:58.800\n The fact that it's rendered,\n\n2:50:58.800 --> 2:51:00.700\n like, is there interesting quirks?\n\n2:51:02.400 --> 2:51:05.240\n Nietzsche with his, if you gaze long into the abyss,\n\n2:51:05.240 --> 2:51:06.880\n the abyss gazes into you.\n\n2:51:08.120 --> 2:51:10.240\n How has these theories, these ideas,\n\n2:51:10.240 --> 2:51:12.040\n changed you as a person?\n\n2:51:13.360 --> 2:51:15.440\n It's been very, very difficult.\n\n2:51:15.440 --> 2:51:19.760\n And this stuff is not just abstract theory building\n\n2:51:19.760 --> 2:51:21.760\n because it's about us.\n\n2:51:21.760 --> 2:51:24.200\n Sometimes I realize that there's this big division in me.\n\n2:51:24.200 --> 2:51:26.600\n My mind is doing all this science\n\n2:51:26.600 --> 2:51:28.520\n and coming up with these conclusions\n\n2:51:28.520 --> 2:51:30.000\n and the rest of me is not integrating.\n\n2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:31.600\n I'm just like, I don't believe it.\n\n2:51:31.600 --> 2:51:32.440\n I just don't believe this.\n\n2:51:32.440 --> 2:51:35.920\n I mean, it seems, so as I start to take it seriously,\n\n2:51:35.920 --> 2:51:37.000\n I get scared myself.\n\n2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:41.040\n It's like, but it's very much,\n\n2:51:41.040 --> 2:51:43.000\n then I read these spiritual traditions\n\n2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:45.100\n and realize they're saying very, very similar things.\n\n2:51:45.100 --> 2:51:48.120\n Like, there's a lot of convergence.\n\n2:51:48.120 --> 2:51:51.240\n So for me, I have,\n\n2:51:52.800 --> 2:51:55.680\n the first time I thought it might be possible\n\n2:51:55.680 --> 2:51:59.840\n that we're not seeing the truth was in 1986.\n\n2:51:59.840 --> 2:52:02.580\n It was from some mathematics we were doing.\n\n2:52:02.580 --> 2:52:05.920\n And when that hit me, it hit me like a ton of bricks.\n\n2:52:05.920 --> 2:52:06.760\n I had to sit down.\n\n2:52:06.760 --> 2:52:11.200\n It was, it really, it was scary.\n\n2:52:11.200 --> 2:52:14.000\n It was really a shock to the system.\n\n2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:16.560\n And then to realize that everything\n\n2:52:16.560 --> 2:52:18.080\n that has been important to me,\n\n2:52:18.080 --> 2:52:21.360\n like, you know, getting a house,\n\n2:52:22.400 --> 2:52:25.200\n getting a car, getting a reputation and so forth.\n\n2:52:26.500 --> 2:52:28.760\n Well, that car is just like the car I see\n\n2:52:28.760 --> 2:52:29.640\n in the virtual reality.\n\n2:52:29.640 --> 2:52:32.600\n It's just there when you perceive it and it's not there.\n\n2:52:32.600 --> 2:52:35.260\n So the whole question of, you know,\n\n2:52:35.260 --> 2:52:36.560\n what am I doing and why?\n\n2:52:36.560 --> 2:52:39.440\n What's worthwhile doing in life?\n\n2:52:39.440 --> 2:52:44.440\n Clearly, getting a big house and getting a big car.\n\n2:52:46.080 --> 2:52:48.160\n I mean, we all knew that we were gonna die.\n\n2:52:48.160 --> 2:52:50.500\n So we tend not to know that.\n\n2:52:50.500 --> 2:52:52.720\n We tend to hide it, especially when we're young.\n\n2:52:52.720 --> 2:52:54.680\n Before age 30, we don't believe we're gonna die.\n\n2:52:54.680 --> 2:52:58.080\n But we factually maybe know that you kind of\n\n2:52:58.080 --> 2:52:59.440\n are supposed to, yeah.\n\n2:52:59.440 --> 2:53:02.180\n But they'll figure something out and we'll be the generation\n\n2:53:02.180 --> 2:53:04.240\n that is the first one that doesn't have to die.\n\n2:53:04.240 --> 2:53:05.180\n That's the kind of thing.\n\n2:53:05.180 --> 2:53:09.420\n But when you really face the fact that you're going to die,\n\n2:53:11.440 --> 2:53:13.360\n and then when I start to look at it from this point of view\n\n2:53:13.360 --> 2:53:16.460\n that, well, this thing was an interface to begin with.\n\n2:53:16.460 --> 2:53:20.180\n So what I'm really, is what I'm really gonna be doing,\n\n2:53:20.180 --> 2:53:21.600\n just taking off a headset.\n\n2:53:21.600 --> 2:53:24.160\n So I've been playing in a virtual reality game all day\n\n2:53:24.160 --> 2:53:27.700\n and I got lost in the game and I was fighting over a Porsche.\n\n2:53:27.700 --> 2:53:31.440\n And I shot some guys up and I punctured their tires\n\n2:53:31.440 --> 2:53:33.000\n and I got the Porsche.\n\n2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:35.120\n Now I take the headset off and what was that for?\n\n2:53:35.120 --> 2:53:37.680\n Nothing, it was just, it was a data structure\n\n2:53:37.680 --> 2:53:39.080\n and the data structure is gone.\n\n2:53:39.080 --> 2:53:42.960\n So all of the wars, the fighting and the reputations\n\n2:53:42.960 --> 2:53:46.960\n and all this stuff, it's just a headset.\n\n2:53:49.680 --> 2:53:52.520\n So my theory says that intellectually,\n\n2:53:52.520 --> 2:53:57.520\n my mind, my emotions rebel all over the place.\n\n2:53:57.520 --> 2:54:02.200\n It's like I, you know, and so I have to meditate.\n\n2:54:02.200 --> 2:54:03.480\n I meditate a lot.\n\n2:54:03.480 --> 2:54:06.320\n What percent of the day would you say you spend\n\n2:54:06.320 --> 2:54:11.040\n as a physicalist sort of living life,\n\n2:54:11.040 --> 2:54:16.040\n pretending your car matters, your reputation matters?\n\n2:54:16.840 --> 2:54:19.580\n Like how much, what's that Tom Waits song,\n\n2:54:19.580 --> 2:54:22.480\n I like my town with a little drop of poison.\n\n2:54:22.480 --> 2:54:25.780\n How much poison do you allow yourself to have?\n\n2:54:25.780 --> 2:54:27.840\n I think my default mode is physicalist.\n\n2:54:27.840 --> 2:54:29.640\n I think that that's just the default.\n\n2:54:30.800 --> 2:54:35.800\n When I'm not being conscious, consciously attentive.\n\n2:54:37.280 --> 2:54:39.000\n Then intellectually consciously attentive,\n\n2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:40.820\n because if you're just, you're still,\n\n2:54:40.820 --> 2:54:43.160\n if you're tasting coffee and not thinking\n\n2:54:43.160 --> 2:54:45.560\n or drinking or just taking in the sunset,\n\n2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:47.440\n you're not being intellectual,\n\n2:54:47.440 --> 2:54:49.480\n but you're still experiencing it.\n\n2:54:49.480 --> 2:54:53.660\n So it's when you turn on the introspective machine,\n\n2:54:53.660 --> 2:54:54.960\n that's when you can start.\n\n2:54:54.960 --> 2:54:56.840\n And turn off the thinker,\n\n2:54:56.840 --> 2:54:59.860\n when I actually just start looking without thinking.\n\n2:55:00.960 --> 2:55:03.800\n So that's when I feel like I,\n\n2:55:03.800 --> 2:55:06.840\n all of a sudden I'm starting to see through.\n\n2:55:06.840 --> 2:55:11.840\n Sort of like, okay, part of the addiction to the interface\n\n2:55:13.280 --> 2:55:14.800\n is all the stories I'm telling about it.\n\n2:55:14.800 --> 2:55:15.960\n It's really important for me to get that,\n\n2:55:15.960 --> 2:55:18.040\n really important to do that.\n\n2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:20.880\n So I'm telling all these stories and so I'm all wrapped up.\n\n2:55:21.760 --> 2:55:24.400\n Almost all of the mind stuff that's going on in my head\n\n2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:28.720\n is about attachment to the interface.\n\n2:55:28.720 --> 2:55:33.720\n And so what I found is that the,\n\n2:55:34.520 --> 2:55:37.400\n essentially the only way to really detach\n\n2:55:37.400 --> 2:55:42.320\n from the interface is to literally let go\n\n2:55:42.320 --> 2:55:44.360\n of thoughts altogether.\n\n2:55:44.360 --> 2:55:49.200\n And then all of a sudden, even my identity,\n\n2:55:49.200 --> 2:55:52.040\n my whole history, my name, my education,\n\n2:55:52.040 --> 2:55:54.760\n all this stuff is almost irrelevant\n\n2:55:54.760 --> 2:55:59.480\n because it's just now here is the present moment.\n\n2:56:00.600 --> 2:56:03.840\n And this is the reality right now.\n\n2:56:03.840 --> 2:56:07.160\n And all of that other stuff is an interface story.\n\n2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:09.520\n But this conscious experience right now,\n\n2:56:09.520 --> 2:56:14.260\n this is the only reality as far as I can tell.\n\n2:56:14.260 --> 2:56:15.560\n The rest of it's a story.\n\n2:56:17.160 --> 2:56:20.620\n But that is, again, not my default.\n\n2:56:20.620 --> 2:56:25.320\n That is, I have to make a really conscious choice\n\n2:56:25.320 --> 2:56:28.400\n to say, okay, I know intellectually\n\n2:56:28.400 --> 2:56:30.440\n this is all an interface.\n\n2:56:30.440 --> 2:56:33.560\n I'm gonna take the headset off and so forth.\n\n2:56:33.560 --> 2:56:36.540\n And then immediately sink back into the game\n\n2:56:36.540 --> 2:56:39.760\n and just be out there playing the game and get lost in it.\n\n2:56:39.760 --> 2:56:41.520\n So I'm always lost in the game\n\n2:56:41.520 --> 2:56:46.520\n unless I literally consciously choose to stop thinking.\n\n2:56:46.520 --> 2:56:50.840\n Isn't it terrifying to acknowledge\n\n2:56:50.840 --> 2:56:55.200\n that, to look beyond the game?\n\n2:56:56.240 --> 2:56:57.680\n Isn't it?\n\n2:56:57.680 --> 2:56:59.800\n It scares the hell out of me.\n\n2:56:59.800 --> 2:57:03.400\n It really is scary because I'm so attached.\n\n2:57:03.400 --> 2:57:04.480\n I'm attached to this body.\n\n2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:05.560\n I'm attached to the interface.\n\n2:57:05.560 --> 2:57:09.840\n Are you ever worried about breaking your brain a bit?\n\n2:57:09.840 --> 2:57:14.840\n Meaning like, it's, I mean, some of these ideas,\n\n2:57:14.840 --> 2:57:17.360\n some of these ideas, when you think about reality,\n\n2:57:17.360 --> 2:57:21.280\n even with like Einstein, just realizing,\n\n2:57:21.280 --> 2:57:25.100\n you said interface, just realizing that light,\n\n2:57:26.960 --> 2:57:28.160\n that there's a speed of light\n\n2:57:28.160 --> 2:57:29.880\n and you can't go faster than the speed of light\n\n2:57:29.880 --> 2:57:34.680\n and what kind of things black holes can do with light,\n\n2:57:34.680 --> 2:57:37.080\n even that can mess with your head.\n\n2:57:37.080 --> 2:57:38.160\n Yes.\n\n2:57:38.160 --> 2:57:41.040\n But that's still space time.\n\n2:57:41.040 --> 2:57:42.760\n That's a big mess, but it's still just space time.\n\n2:57:42.760 --> 2:57:44.760\n It's still a property of our interface.\n\n2:57:44.760 --> 2:57:45.600\n That's right.\n\n2:57:45.600 --> 2:57:49.880\n But it's still like, even Einstein realized\n\n2:57:49.880 --> 2:57:51.480\n that this particular thing,\n\n2:57:51.480 --> 2:57:53.000\n some of the stories we tell ourselves\n\n2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:56.040\n is constructing interfaces\n\n2:57:56.040 --> 2:57:59.440\n that are oversimplifying the way things work\n\n2:58:00.400 --> 2:58:01.640\n because it's nice.\n\n2:58:01.640 --> 2:58:03.640\n The stories are nice.\n\n2:58:03.640 --> 2:58:04.920\n Stories are nice.\n\n2:58:04.920 --> 2:58:07.880\n I mean, just like video games, they're nice.\n\n2:58:07.880 --> 2:58:10.200\n Right, but Einstein was a realist, right?\n\n2:58:10.200 --> 2:58:12.160\n He was a famous realist in the sense\n\n2:58:12.160 --> 2:58:15.160\n that he was very explicit in a 1935 paper\n\n2:58:15.160 --> 2:58:18.280\n with Podolsky and Rosen, the EPR paper, right?\n\n2:58:19.680 --> 2:58:24.680\n They said, if without in any way disturbing a system,\n\n2:58:26.160 --> 2:58:28.640\n I can predict with probability one,\n\n2:58:28.640 --> 2:58:30.040\n the outcome of a measurement,\n\n2:58:30.960 --> 2:58:35.960\n then there exists in reality that element, right?\n\n2:58:36.320 --> 2:58:39.360\n That value that, and we now know from quantum theory\n\n2:58:39.360 --> 2:58:41.000\n that that's false.\n\n2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:46.000\n Einstein's idea of local realism is strictly speaking false.\n\n2:58:46.600 --> 2:58:47.440\n Yeah.\n\n2:58:47.440 --> 2:58:50.400\n And so we can predict, we can set up,\n\n2:58:50.400 --> 2:58:52.320\n in quantum theory, you can set up,\n\n2:58:52.320 --> 2:58:55.960\n and there's a paper by Chris Fuchs, quantum Bayesianism,\n\n2:58:55.960 --> 2:58:58.040\n where he scouts this out.\n\n2:58:58.040 --> 2:58:58.880\n It was done by other people,\n\n2:58:58.880 --> 2:59:00.840\n but he gives a good presentation of this,\n\n2:59:00.840 --> 2:59:02.360\n where they have a sequence of something\n\n2:59:02.360 --> 2:59:05.640\n like nine different quantum measurements that you can make.\n\n2:59:05.640 --> 2:59:08.160\n And you can predict with probability one\n\n2:59:08.160 --> 2:59:10.000\n what a particular outcome will be,\n\n2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:14.880\n but you can actually prove that it's impossible\n\n2:59:14.880 --> 2:59:18.200\n that the value existed before you made the measurement.\n\n2:59:18.200 --> 2:59:20.240\n So you know with probability one what you're gonna get,\n\n2:59:20.240 --> 2:59:22.480\n but you also know with certainty\n\n2:59:22.480 --> 2:59:23.560\n that that value was not there\n\n2:59:23.560 --> 2:59:25.320\n until you made the measurement.\n\n2:59:25.320 --> 2:59:27.480\n So we know from quantum theory\n\n2:59:27.480 --> 2:59:31.120\n that the act of observation is an act of fact creation.\n\n2:59:32.680 --> 2:59:35.160\n And that is built into what I'm saying\n\n2:59:35.160 --> 2:59:36.720\n with this theory of consciousness.\n\n2:59:36.720 --> 2:59:38.960\n If consciousness is fundamental,\n\n2:59:38.960 --> 2:59:42.240\n space time itself is an act of fact creation.\n\n2:59:42.240 --> 2:59:44.840\n It's an interface that we create, consciousness creates,\n\n2:59:44.840 --> 2:59:46.040\n plus all the objects in it.\n\n2:59:46.040 --> 2:59:48.920\n So local realism is not true.\n\n2:59:50.280 --> 2:59:51.840\n Quantum theory has established that.\n\n2:59:51.840 --> 2:59:54.600\n Also noncontextual realism is not true.\n\n2:59:54.600 --> 2:59:57.200\n And that fits in perfectly with this idea\n\n2:59:57.200 --> 2:59:59.600\n that consciousness is fundamental.\n\n2:59:59.600 --> 3:00:01.840\n These things are, these exist as data structures\n\n3:00:01.840 --> 3:00:02.840\n when we create them.\n\n3:00:03.760 --> 3:00:06.720\n As Chris Fuchs says, the act of observation\n\n3:00:06.720 --> 3:00:08.760\n is an act of fact creation.\n\n3:00:08.760 --> 3:00:10.960\n But I must say on a personal level,\n\n3:00:12.480 --> 3:00:15.020\n I'm having to spend,\n\n3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:17.760\n I spend a couple hours a day\n\n3:00:19.920 --> 3:00:22.480\n just sitting in meditation on this\n\n3:00:22.480 --> 3:00:27.480\n and facing the rebellion in me\n\n3:00:27.480 --> 3:00:28.720\n that goes to the core,\n\n3:00:28.720 --> 3:00:30.360\n it feels like it goes to the core of my being,\n\n3:00:30.360 --> 3:00:31.960\n rebellion against these ideas.\n\n3:00:31.960 --> 3:00:33.560\n So here it's very, very interesting\n\n3:00:33.560 --> 3:00:34.880\n for me to look at this because,\n\n3:00:34.880 --> 3:00:37.320\n so here I'm a scientist and I'm a person.\n\n3:00:37.320 --> 3:00:39.160\n The science is really clear.\n\n3:00:39.160 --> 3:00:40.280\n Local realism is false.\n\n3:00:40.280 --> 3:00:42.220\n Noncontextual realism is false.\n\n3:00:42.220 --> 3:00:43.280\n Space time is doomed.\n\n3:00:43.280 --> 3:00:44.560\n It's very, very clear.\n\n3:00:44.560 --> 3:00:46.000\n It couldn't be clearer.\n\n3:00:47.600 --> 3:00:50.240\n And my emotions rebel left and right.\n\n3:00:50.240 --> 3:00:52.040\n When I sit there and say, okay,\n\n3:00:52.040 --> 3:00:53.840\n I am not something in space and time.\n\n3:00:55.080 --> 3:00:57.720\n Something inside of me says, you're crazy.\n\n3:00:57.720 --> 3:00:58.560\n Of course you are.\n\n3:00:58.560 --> 3:01:00.160\n And I'm completely attached to it.\n\n3:01:00.160 --> 3:01:02.000\n I'm completely attached to all this stuff.\n\n3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:02.960\n I'm attached to my body.\n\n3:01:02.960 --> 3:01:04.640\n I'm attached to the headset.\n\n3:01:04.640 --> 3:01:06.920\n I'm attached to my car.\n\n3:01:06.920 --> 3:01:07.760\n I'm attached to people.\n\n3:01:07.760 --> 3:01:08.920\n I'm attached to all of it.\n\n3:01:09.960 --> 3:01:12.800\n And yet I know as an absolute fact,\n\n3:01:12.800 --> 3:01:14.680\n I'm gonna walk away from all of it.\n\n3:01:14.680 --> 3:01:15.520\n I'm gonna die.\n\n3:01:19.920 --> 3:01:21.560\n In fact, I almost died last year.\n\n3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:22.880\n COVID almost killed me.\n\n3:01:24.520 --> 3:01:26.560\n I sent a goodbye text to my wife.\n\n3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:28.320\n So I thought I was done.\n\n3:01:28.320 --> 3:01:29.240\n You really did.\n\n3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:30.480\n I sent her a goodbye.\n\n3:01:30.480 --> 3:01:35.480\n I was in the emergency room and it had attacked my heart\n\n3:01:35.480 --> 3:01:39.000\n and it had been at 190 beats per minute for 36 hours.\n\n3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:41.360\n I couldn't last much longer.\n\n3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:43.720\n I knew I couldn't, they couldn't stop it.\n\n3:01:43.720 --> 3:01:46.440\n So that was it.\n\n3:01:46.440 --> 3:01:47.280\n So that was it.\n\n3:01:47.280 --> 3:01:50.440\n So I texted her goodbye from the emergency room.\n\n3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:52.240\n I love you, goodbye kind of thing.\n\n3:01:52.240 --> 3:01:53.560\n Yeah, right.\n\n3:01:53.560 --> 3:01:54.800\n Yeah, that was it.\n\n3:01:54.800 --> 3:01:55.640\n So, so.\n\n3:01:55.640 --> 3:01:56.480\n Were you afraid?\n\n3:01:57.360 --> 3:01:59.120\n God, it scares the hell out of you, right?\n\n3:01:59.120 --> 3:02:02.600\n But there was, you're just feeling so bad anyway\n\n3:02:02.600 --> 3:02:06.800\n that sort of you're scared, but you're just feeling so bad\n\n3:02:06.800 --> 3:02:09.200\n that in some sense you just want it to stop anyway.\n\n3:02:10.840 --> 3:02:15.840\n So I've been there and faced it just a year ago.\n\n3:02:16.840 --> 3:02:18.840\n How did that change you, by the way?\n\n3:02:18.840 --> 3:02:22.600\n Having this intellectual reality that's so challenging\n\n3:02:22.600 --> 3:02:25.480\n that you meditate on, it's just an interface.\n\n3:02:25.480 --> 3:02:28.840\n And one of the hardest things to come to terms with\n\n3:02:28.840 --> 3:02:32.960\n is that that means that it's gonna end.\n\n3:02:35.480 --> 3:02:37.480\n How did that change you having come so close\n\n3:02:37.480 --> 3:02:38.320\n to the reality of it?\n\n3:02:38.320 --> 3:02:39.920\n It's not just an intellectual reality,\n\n3:02:39.920 --> 3:02:43.760\n it's a reality of death.\n\n3:02:43.760 --> 3:02:46.800\n It's forced, I've meditated for 20 years now.\n\n3:02:47.720 --> 3:02:50.360\n And I would say averaging three or four hours a day.\n\n3:02:52.920 --> 3:02:57.440\n But it's put a new urgency,\n\n3:02:57.440 --> 3:02:59.280\n but urgency is not the right word\n\n3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:04.280\n because it's riveted my attention, I'll put it that way.\n\n3:03:05.200 --> 3:03:09.640\n It's really riveted my attention and I've really paid,\n\n3:03:10.520 --> 3:03:12.040\n I spent a lot more time looking up\n\n3:03:12.040 --> 3:03:13.880\n what spiritual traditions say.\n\n3:03:15.280 --> 3:03:18.760\n I don't, by the way, again, not taking it with the,\n\n3:03:19.800 --> 3:03:21.440\n take it all with a grain of salt.\n\n3:03:21.440 --> 3:03:23.400\n But on the other hand, I think it's stupid for me\n\n3:03:23.400 --> 3:03:24.320\n to ignore it.\n\n3:03:24.320 --> 3:03:28.880\n So I try to listen to the best ideas\n\n3:03:28.880 --> 3:03:32.240\n and to sort out nonsense from,\n\n3:03:32.240 --> 3:03:34.480\n and we all have to do it for ourselves, right?\n\n3:03:34.480 --> 3:03:35.520\n It's not easy.\n\n3:03:35.520 --> 3:03:37.360\n So what makes sense?\n\n3:03:37.360 --> 3:03:39.280\n And I have the advantage of some science\n\n3:03:39.280 --> 3:03:40.800\n so I can look at what science says\n\n3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:43.080\n and try to compare with spiritual tradition.\n\n3:03:43.080 --> 3:03:44.880\n I try to sort it out for myself.\n\n3:03:46.560 --> 3:03:48.360\n But then I also look and realize\n\n3:03:48.360 --> 3:03:49.600\n that there's another aspect to me,\n\n3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:51.440\n which is this whole emotional aspect.\n\n3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:54.200\n The, I seem to be wired up\n\n3:03:56.040 --> 3:04:00.680\n as evolutionary psychology says I'm wired up, right?\n\n3:04:00.680 --> 3:04:03.400\n All these defensive mechanisms, you know,\n\n3:04:03.400 --> 3:04:06.040\n I'm inclined to lie if I need to.\n\n3:04:06.040 --> 3:04:10.080\n I'm inclined to be angry, to protect myself,\n\n3:04:10.080 --> 3:04:12.280\n to have an in group and an out group,\n\n3:04:12.280 --> 3:04:16.800\n to try to make my reputation as big as possible,\n\n3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:18.640\n to try to demean the out group.\n\n3:04:18.640 --> 3:04:19.480\n There's all these things\n\n3:04:19.480 --> 3:04:22.320\n that evolutionary psychology is spot on.\n\n3:04:22.320 --> 3:04:25.400\n It's really bright about the human condition.\n\n3:04:25.400 --> 3:04:29.640\n And yet I think evolution, as I said, evolutionary theory\n\n3:04:29.640 --> 3:04:31.160\n is a projection of a deeper theory\n\n3:04:31.160 --> 3:04:32.960\n where there may be no competition.\n\n3:04:33.920 --> 3:04:37.800\n So how, so I'm in this very interesting position\n\n3:04:37.800 --> 3:04:40.320\n where I feel like, okay,\n\n3:04:40.320 --> 3:04:42.200\n according to my own theory, I'm consciousness.\n\n3:04:42.200 --> 3:04:43.720\n And maybe this is what it means\n\n3:04:43.720 --> 3:04:46.480\n for consciousness to wake up.\n\n3:04:46.480 --> 3:04:48.400\n It's not easy.\n\n3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:52.240\n It's almost like I have,\n\n3:04:52.240 --> 3:04:54.680\n I feel like I have real skin in the game.\n\n3:04:54.680 --> 3:04:55.760\n It really is scary.\n\n3:04:55.760 --> 3:04:58.720\n I really was scared when I was about to die.\n\n3:04:58.720 --> 3:05:02.360\n It really was hard to say goodbye to my wife.\n\n3:05:02.360 --> 3:05:04.640\n It really, it really pained.\n\n3:05:04.640 --> 3:05:09.360\n And to then look at that and then look at the fact\n\n3:05:09.360 --> 3:05:11.560\n that I'm gonna walk away from this anyway\n\n3:05:11.560 --> 3:05:12.800\n and it's just an interface.\n\n3:05:12.800 --> 3:05:16.240\n How do I, so it's trying to put all this stuff together\n\n3:05:16.240 --> 3:05:19.320\n and really grok it, so to speak,\n\n3:05:19.320 --> 3:05:22.680\n not just intellectually, but grok it at an emotional level.\n\n3:05:22.680 --> 3:05:23.920\n Yeah, what are you afraid of,\n\n3:05:23.920 --> 3:05:26.680\n you silly evolved organism\n\n3:05:26.680 --> 3:05:30.000\n that's gotten way too attached to the interface?\n\n3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:32.000\n What are you really afraid of?\n\n3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:32.840\n That's right.\n\n3:05:33.880 --> 3:05:34.880\n Is there a...\n\n3:05:34.880 --> 3:05:36.640\n Very personal, you know, it's very, very personal.\n\n3:05:36.640 --> 3:05:37.480\n Yeah.\n\n3:05:37.480 --> 3:05:38.920\n Yeah.\n\n3:05:38.920 --> 3:05:40.960\n I mean, speaking of the text,\n\n3:05:40.960 --> 3:05:43.920\n what do you think is this whole love thing?\n\n3:05:43.920 --> 3:05:48.920\n What's the role of love in our human condition?\n\n3:05:49.200 --> 3:05:51.040\n This interface thing we have,\n\n3:05:51.040 --> 3:05:53.040\n is this somehow interweaved,\n\n3:05:53.040 --> 3:05:54.640\n interconnected with consciousness?\n\n3:05:54.640 --> 3:05:56.600\n This attachment we have to other humans\n\n3:05:56.600 --> 3:05:59.600\n and this deep, like some quality to it\n\n3:06:02.920 --> 3:06:07.440\n that seems very interesting, peculiar.\n\n3:06:07.440 --> 3:06:11.200\n Well, there are two levels I would think about that.\n\n3:06:11.200 --> 3:06:12.880\n There's love in the sexual sense\n\n3:06:12.880 --> 3:06:15.400\n and there's love in a deeper sense.\n\n3:06:15.400 --> 3:06:16.960\n And in the sexual sense,\n\n3:06:16.960 --> 3:06:20.040\n we can give an evolutionary account of that and so forth.\n\n3:06:20.040 --> 3:06:22.200\n And I think that's pretty clear to people.\n\n3:06:24.480 --> 3:06:27.640\n In this deeper sense, right?\n\n3:06:27.640 --> 3:06:32.320\n So of course, I love my wife in a sexual sense,\n\n3:06:32.320 --> 3:06:34.040\n but there is a deeper sense as well.\n\n3:06:34.040 --> 3:06:35.080\n When I was saying goodbye to her,\n\n3:06:35.080 --> 3:06:38.440\n there was a much deeper love that was really at play there.\n\n3:06:38.440 --> 3:06:40.560\n That's one place where I think\n\n3:06:40.560 --> 3:06:43.200\n that the mixed bag from spiritual traditions\n\n3:06:43.200 --> 3:06:44.080\n has something right.\n\n3:06:44.080 --> 3:06:46.240\n When they say, love your neighbor as yourself,\n\n3:06:46.240 --> 3:06:49.440\n that in some sense, love is fundamental.\n\n3:06:49.440 --> 3:06:51.880\n I think that they're onto something,\n\n3:06:51.880 --> 3:06:53.840\n something very, very deep and profound.\n\n3:06:54.800 --> 3:06:57.480\n And every once in a while,\n\n3:06:57.480 --> 3:06:58.960\n I can get a personal glimpse of that,\n\n3:06:58.960 --> 3:07:03.800\n especially when I'm in the space with no thought.\n\n3:07:03.800 --> 3:07:06.000\n When I can really let go of thoughts,\n\n3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:10.200\n I get little glimpses of a love\n\n3:07:10.200 --> 3:07:11.960\n in the sense that I'm not separate.\n\n3:07:11.960 --> 3:07:16.600\n It's a love in the sense that I'm not different from that.\n\n3:07:18.440 --> 3:07:21.240\n If you and I are separate, then I can fight you.\n\n3:07:21.240 --> 3:07:25.120\n But if you and I are the same, if there's a union there.\n\n3:07:25.120 --> 3:07:26.720\n The togetherness of it, yeah.\n\n3:07:26.720 --> 3:07:28.600\n What, who's God?\n\n3:07:29.520 --> 3:07:32.840\n All those gods, the stories that have been told\n\n3:07:32.840 --> 3:07:36.680\n throughout history, you said through the spiritual traditions.\n\n3:07:36.680 --> 3:07:37.840\n What do you think that is?\n\n3:07:37.840 --> 3:07:42.840\n Is that us trying to find that common thing at the core?\n\n3:07:44.320 --> 3:07:48.800\n Well, in many traditions, not all.\n\n3:07:50.760 --> 3:07:53.760\n The one I was raised in, so my dad was a Protestant minister.\n\n3:07:54.760 --> 3:07:57.880\n We tend to think of God as a being.\n\n3:08:00.000 --> 3:08:02.760\n But I think that that's not right.\n\n3:08:02.760 --> 3:08:06.840\n I think the closest way to think about God is being, period.\n\n3:08:06.840 --> 3:08:11.840\n Not a being, but being, the very ground of being itself is God.\n\n3:08:12.280 --> 3:08:16.280\n I think that's the deep, and from my point of view,\n\n3:08:16.280 --> 3:08:17.560\n that's the ground of consciousness.\n\n3:08:17.560 --> 3:08:22.400\n So the ground of conscious being is what we might call God.\n\n3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:25.160\n But the word God has always been,\n\n3:08:25.160 --> 3:08:27.560\n for example, you don't believe the same God as my God,\n\n3:08:27.560 --> 3:08:30.400\n so I'm gonna fight you, or we'll have wars over,\n\n3:08:30.400 --> 3:08:34.400\n because the being, the specific being that you call God\n\n3:08:34.400 --> 3:08:35.880\n is different from the being that I call God,\n\n3:08:35.880 --> 3:08:36.840\n and so we fight.\n\n3:08:36.840 --> 3:08:40.920\n Whereas if it's not a being, but just being,\n\n3:08:40.920 --> 3:08:42.880\n and you and I share a being,\n\n3:08:42.880 --> 3:08:45.000\n then you and I are not separate,\n\n3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:46.840\n and there's no reason to fight.\n\n3:08:46.840 --> 3:08:48.720\n We're both part of that one being,\n\n3:08:48.720 --> 3:08:51.960\n and loving you is loving myself,\n\n3:08:51.960 --> 3:08:54.000\n because we're all part of that one being.\n\n3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:57.240\n The spiritual traditions that point to that,\n\n3:08:57.240 --> 3:09:01.280\n I think are pointing in a very interesting direction,\n\n3:09:01.280 --> 3:09:04.720\n and that does seem to match with the mathematics\n\n3:09:04.720 --> 3:09:05.760\n of the conscious agent stuff\n\n3:09:05.760 --> 3:09:07.360\n that I've been working on as well,\n\n3:09:07.360 --> 3:09:11.520\n that it really fits with that, although that wasn't my goal.\n\n3:09:11.520 --> 3:09:13.560\n Is there, you mentioned,\n\n3:09:15.320 --> 3:09:19.480\n you mentioned that the young physicists that you talk to,\n\n3:09:19.480 --> 3:09:23.720\n or whose work you follow, have quite a lot of fun\n\n3:09:23.720 --> 3:09:26.160\n breaking with the traditions of the past,\n\n3:09:26.160 --> 3:09:27.800\n the assumptions of the past.\n\n3:09:28.640 --> 3:09:31.160\n What advice would you give to young people today,\n\n3:09:31.160 --> 3:09:34.080\n in high school, in college, not just physicists,\n\n3:09:34.080 --> 3:09:38.760\n but in general, how to have a career they can be proud of,\n\n3:09:38.760 --> 3:09:41.440\n how they can have a life they can be proud of,\n\n3:09:41.440 --> 3:09:43.000\n how to make their way in the world,\n\n3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:45.960\n from the lessons, from the wins and the losses\n\n3:09:45.960 --> 3:09:49.360\n in your own life, what little insights could you pull out?\n\n3:09:50.200 --> 3:09:53.920\n I would say the universe is a lot more interesting\n\n3:09:53.920 --> 3:09:58.520\n than you might expect, and you are a lot more special\n\n3:09:58.520 --> 3:09:59.960\n and interesting than you might expect.\n\n3:09:59.960 --> 3:10:03.720\n You might think that you're just a little, tiny,\n\n3:10:03.720 --> 3:10:08.720\n irrelevant, 100 pound, 200 pound person\n\n3:10:09.400 --> 3:10:12.720\n in a vast billions of light years across space,\n\n3:10:14.240 --> 3:10:15.920\n and that's not the case.\n\n3:10:15.920 --> 3:10:18.920\n You are, in some sense, the being that's creating\n\n3:10:18.920 --> 3:10:21.520\n that space all the time, every time you look.\n\n3:10:21.520 --> 3:10:25.280\n So, waking up to who you really are,\n\n3:10:25.280 --> 3:10:26.640\n outside of space and time,\n\n3:10:27.960 --> 3:10:29.360\n as the author of space and time,\n\n3:10:29.360 --> 3:10:32.040\n as the author of everything that you see.\n\n3:10:32.040 --> 3:10:36.320\n The author of space and time, sorry.\n\n3:10:36.320 --> 3:10:38.240\n You're the author of space and time,\n\n3:10:38.240 --> 3:10:40.000\n and I'm the author of space and time,\n\n3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:42.640\n and space and time is just one little data structure.\n\n3:10:42.640 --> 3:10:44.120\n Many other consciousnesses are creating\n\n3:10:44.120 --> 3:10:46.000\n other data structures, they're authors\n\n3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:48.240\n of various other things.\n\n3:10:48.240 --> 3:10:52.040\n So, realizing, and then realizing that,\n\n3:10:52.040 --> 3:10:54.920\n I had this feeling growing up, going to college,\n\n3:10:54.920 --> 3:10:57.520\n reading all these textbooks, oh man, it's all been done.\n\n3:10:59.080 --> 3:11:00.560\n If I'd just been there 50 years ago,\n\n3:11:00.560 --> 3:11:01.520\n I could have discovered this stuff,\n\n3:11:01.520 --> 3:11:03.800\n but it's all in the textbooks now.\n\n3:11:03.800 --> 3:11:07.240\n Well, believe me, the textbooks are gonna look silly\n\n3:11:07.240 --> 3:11:10.160\n in 50 years, and it's your chance\n\n3:11:10.160 --> 3:11:11.160\n to write the new textbook.\n\n3:11:11.160 --> 3:11:14.600\n So, of course, study the current textbooks.\n\n3:11:14.600 --> 3:11:15.920\n You have to understand them.\n\n3:11:15.920 --> 3:11:19.200\n There's no way to progress until you understand\n\n3:11:19.200 --> 3:11:22.040\n what's been done, but then,\n\n3:11:23.440 --> 3:11:26.000\n the only limit is your imagination, frankly.\n\n3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:26.840\n That's the only limit.\n\n3:11:26.840 --> 3:11:29.160\n The greatest books, the greatest textbooks\n\n3:11:29.160 --> 3:11:31.880\n ever written on Earth are yet to be written.\n\n3:11:31.880 --> 3:11:32.720\n Exactly.\n\n3:11:35.080 --> 3:11:36.880\n What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?\n\n3:11:36.880 --> 3:11:40.160\n What's the meaning of life from your limited interface?\n\n3:11:40.160 --> 3:11:43.400\n Can you figure it all out, like why?\n\n3:11:43.400 --> 3:11:46.040\n So, you said the universe is kind of trying to figure\n\n3:11:46.040 --> 3:11:47.840\n itself out through us.\n\n3:11:49.000 --> 3:11:50.320\n Why?\n\n3:11:50.320 --> 3:11:51.160\n Why?\n\n3:11:54.040 --> 3:11:55.400\n Yeah, that's the closest I've come.\n\n3:11:55.400 --> 3:12:00.400\n So, I'll give you, so I will say that I don't know,\n\n3:12:00.400 --> 3:12:02.680\n but here's my guess, right?\n\n3:12:02.680 --> 3:12:03.920\n That's a good first sentence.\n\n3:12:03.920 --> 3:12:05.200\n That's a good starting point.\n\n3:12:05.200 --> 3:12:08.600\n And maybe that's gonna be a profound part\n\n3:12:08.600 --> 3:12:10.800\n of the final answer is to start with the I don't know.\n\n3:12:10.800 --> 3:12:13.760\n It's quite possible that that's really important\n\n3:12:13.760 --> 3:12:15.240\n to start with the I don't know.\n\n3:12:15.240 --> 3:12:18.600\n My guess is that if consciousness is fundamental\n\n3:12:18.600 --> 3:12:22.960\n and if G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem holds here,\n\n3:12:22.960 --> 3:12:26.360\n and there's infinite variety of structures\n\n3:12:27.600 --> 3:12:29.960\n for consciousness to some sense explore,\n\n3:12:34.240 --> 3:12:37.080\n that maybe that's what it's about.\n\n3:12:37.080 --> 3:12:39.400\n This is something that Annika and I talked about a little bit\n\n3:12:39.400 --> 3:12:40.840\n and she doesn't like this way of talking about it.\n\n3:12:40.840 --> 3:12:42.680\n And so I'm gonna have to talk with her some more\n\n3:12:42.680 --> 3:12:43.920\n about this way of talking.\n\n3:12:43.920 --> 3:12:45.440\n But right now I'll just put it this way\n\n3:12:45.440 --> 3:12:46.440\n and I'll have to talk with her more\n\n3:12:46.440 --> 3:12:48.920\n and see if I can say it more clearly.\n\n3:12:48.920 --> 3:12:51.920\n But the way I'm talking about it now is that\n\n3:12:55.680 --> 3:12:59.200\n there's a sense in which there's being\n\n3:13:01.640 --> 3:13:03.840\n and then there's the experiences or forms\n\n3:13:03.840 --> 3:13:05.680\n that come out of being.\n\n3:13:05.680 --> 3:13:09.800\n That's one deep, deep mystery.\n\n3:13:09.800 --> 3:13:13.680\n And the question that you asked, what is it all about?\n\n3:13:13.680 --> 3:13:15.240\n Somehow it's related to that.\n\n3:13:15.240 --> 3:13:19.600\n Why does being, why doesn't it just stay without any forms?\n\n3:13:19.600 --> 3:13:22.560\n Why do we have experiences?\n\n3:13:22.560 --> 3:13:26.680\n Why not just have, when you close your eyes\n\n3:13:26.680 --> 3:13:30.040\n and pay attention to what's behind you, there's nothing.\n\n3:13:30.040 --> 3:13:30.960\n But there's being.\n\n3:13:30.960 --> 3:13:35.960\n So why don't we just stop there?\n\n3:13:35.960 --> 3:13:37.000\n Why didn't we just stop there?\n\n3:13:37.000 --> 3:13:39.400\n Why did we create all tables and chairs\n\n3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:41.720\n and the sun and moon and people?\n\n3:13:41.720 --> 3:13:43.840\n All this really complicated stuff, why?\n\n3:13:44.720 --> 3:13:49.440\n And all I can guess right now,\n\n3:13:49.440 --> 3:13:51.840\n and I'll probably kick myself in a couple of years\n\n3:13:51.840 --> 3:13:53.960\n and say that was dumb, but all I can guess right now\n\n3:13:53.960 --> 3:13:57.880\n is that somehow consciousness wakes up to itself\n\n3:13:57.880 --> 3:13:59.080\n by knowing what it's not.\n\n3:13:59.080 --> 3:14:02.280\n So here I am, I'm not this body.\n\n3:14:02.280 --> 3:14:05.640\n And I sort of saw that, it was sort of in my face\n\n3:14:05.640 --> 3:14:08.320\n when I sent a text goodbye.\n\n3:14:08.320 --> 3:14:10.520\n But then as soon as I'm better, it's sort of like,\n\n3:14:10.520 --> 3:14:13.320\n okay, I sort of don't wanna go there, right?\n\n3:14:13.320 --> 3:14:17.560\n I, okay, so I just, so I am my body.\n\n3:14:17.560 --> 3:14:19.640\n I go back to the standard thing, I am my body\n\n3:14:19.640 --> 3:14:21.560\n and then I want to get that car.\n\n3:14:21.560 --> 3:14:24.080\n And even though I was just about to die a year ago,\n\n3:14:24.080 --> 3:14:26.000\n so that comes rushing back.\n\n3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:31.000\n So consciousness immerses itself fully\n\n3:14:31.760 --> 3:14:35.040\n into a particular headset.\n\n3:14:36.440 --> 3:14:39.760\n Gets lost in it and then slowly wakes up.\n\n3:14:39.760 --> 3:14:41.920\n Just so it can escape and that is the waking up,\n\n3:14:41.920 --> 3:14:43.240\n but it needs to have a negative.\n\n3:14:43.240 --> 3:14:44.960\n It needs to know what it's not.\n\n3:14:44.960 --> 3:14:47.720\n It needs to know what you are.\n\n3:14:47.720 --> 3:14:49.600\n You have to say, oh, I'm not that, I'm not that.\n\n3:14:49.600 --> 3:14:52.600\n That wasn't important, that wasn't important.\n\n3:14:52.600 --> 3:14:53.720\n That's really powerful.\n\n3:14:53.720 --> 3:14:57.760\n Don, let me just say that because I've been\n\n3:14:57.760 --> 3:15:01.120\n a long term fan of yours and we're supposed\n\n3:15:01.120 --> 3:15:03.840\n to have a conversation during this very difficult moment\n\n3:15:03.840 --> 3:15:06.840\n in your life, let me just say you're a truly special person\n\n3:15:06.840 --> 3:15:10.800\n and I for one, I know there's a lot of others that agree.\n\n3:15:10.800 --> 3:15:13.720\n I'm glad that you're still here with us on this earth\n\n3:15:13.720 --> 3:15:15.240\n if for a short time.\n\n3:15:17.360 --> 3:15:21.760\n So whatever, whatever the universe,\n\n3:15:21.760 --> 3:15:25.480\n whatever plan it has for you that brought you close\n\n3:15:25.480 --> 3:15:28.560\n to death to maybe enlighten you some kind of way,\n\n3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:34.040\n I think it has an interesting plan for you.\n\n3:15:34.040 --> 3:15:35.960\n You're one of the truly special humans\n\n3:15:35.960 --> 3:15:37.480\n and it's a huge honor that you would sit\n\n3:15:37.480 --> 3:15:38.800\n and talk with me today.\n\n3:15:38.800 --> 3:15:39.640\n Thank you so much.\n\n3:15:39.640 --> 3:15:40.520\n Thank you very much, Lex.\n\n3:15:40.520 --> 3:15:42.760\n I really appreciate that, thank you.\n\n3:15:42.760 --> 3:15:44.200\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n3:15:44.200 --> 3:15:45.480\n with Donald Hoffman.\n\n3:15:45.480 --> 3:15:48.200\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors\n\n3:15:48.200 --> 3:15:50.880\n in the description and now, let me leave you\n\n3:15:50.880 --> 3:15:53.120\n with some words from Albert Einstein,\n\n3:15:53.120 --> 3:15:56.040\n relevant to the ideas discussed in this conversation.\n\n3:15:56.960 --> 3:16:01.240\n Time and space are modes by which we think\n\n3:16:01.240 --> 3:16:03.680\n and not conditions in which we live.\n\n3:16:03.680 --> 3:16:23.680\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
