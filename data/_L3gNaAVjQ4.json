00:09.320\n He's the founder of Comma AI,\n\n00:09.320 --> 00:12.880\n an autonomous and semi autonomous vehicle technology company\n\n00:12.880 --> 00:15.840\n that seeks to be to Tesla Autopilot\n\n00:15.840 --> 00:18.920\n what Android is to the iOS.\n\n00:18.920 --> 00:22.760\n They sell the Comma 2 device for $1,000\n\n00:22.760 --> 00:25.600\n that when installed in many of their supported cars\n\n00:25.600 --> 00:27.960\n can keep the vehicle centered in the lane\n\n00:27.960 --> 00:30.760\n even when there are no lane markings.\n\n00:30.760 --> 00:32.400\n It includes driver sensing\n\n00:32.400 --> 00:35.640\n that ensures that the driver's eyes are on the road.\n\n00:35.640 --> 00:38.440\n As you may know, I'm a big fan of driver sensing.\n\n00:38.440 --> 00:40.560\n I do believe Tesla Autopilot and others\n\n00:40.560 --> 00:43.520\n should definitely include it in their sensor suite.\n\n00:43.520 --> 00:47.120\n Also, I'm a fan of Android and a big fan of George\n\n00:47.120 --> 00:48.240\n for many reasons,\n\n00:48.240 --> 00:51.640\n including his nonlinear out of the box brilliance\n\n00:51.640 --> 00:55.120\n and the fact that he's a superstar programmer\n\n00:55.120 --> 00:57.360\n of a very different style than myself.\n\n00:57.360 --> 01:01.160\n Styles make fights and styles make conversations.\n\n01:01.160 --> 01:02.920\n So I really enjoyed this chat\n\n01:02.920 --> 01:06.280\n and I'm sure we'll talk many more times on this podcast.\n\n01:06.280 --> 01:07.680\n Quick mention of a sponsor\n\n01:07.680 --> 01:10.160\n followed by some thoughts related to the episode.\n\n01:10.160 --> 01:12.240\n First is Four Sigmatic,\n\n01:12.240 --> 01:15.360\n the maker of delicious mushroom coffee.\n\n01:15.360 --> 01:17.520\n Second is The Coding Digital,\n\n01:17.520 --> 01:19.760\n a podcast on tech and entrepreneurship\n\n01:19.760 --> 01:22.080\n that I listen to and enjoy.\n\n01:22.080 --> 01:24.520\n And finally, ExpressVPN,\n\n01:24.520 --> 01:27.800\n the VPN I've used for many years to protect my privacy\n\n01:27.800 --> 01:29.320\n on the internet.\n\n01:29.320 --> 01:31.280\n Please check out the sponsors in the description\n\n01:31.280 --> 01:34.840\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n01:34.840 --> 01:38.080\n As a side note, let me say that my work at MIT\n\n01:38.080 --> 01:40.480\n on autonomous and semi autonomous vehicles\n\n01:40.480 --> 01:43.080\n led me to study the human side of autonomy\n\n01:43.080 --> 01:46.600\n enough to understand that it's a beautifully complicated\n\n01:46.600 --> 01:48.600\n and interesting problem space,\n\n01:48.600 --> 01:51.800\n much richer than what can be studied in the lab.\n\n01:51.800 --> 01:55.360\n In that sense, the data that Comma AI, Tesla Autopilot\n\n01:55.360 --> 01:58.480\n and perhaps others like Cadillac Super Cruiser collecting\n\n01:58.480 --> 02:00.560\n gives us a chance to understand\n\n02:00.560 --> 02:03.800\n how we can design safe semi autonomous vehicles\n\n02:03.800 --> 02:07.560\n for real human beings in real world conditions.\n\n02:07.560 --> 02:09.920\n I think this requires bold innovation\n\n02:09.920 --> 02:13.000\n and a serious exploration of the first principles\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:15.640\n of the driving task itself.\n\n02:15.640 --> 02:17.880\n If you enjoyed this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n02:17.880 --> 02:20.160\n review it with five stars and up a podcast,\n\n02:20.160 --> 02:22.760\n follow on Spotify, support on Patreon\n\n02:22.760 --> 02:26.280\n or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.\n\n02:26.280 --> 02:30.400\n And now here's my conversation with George Hotz.\n\n02:31.360 --> 02:34.040\n So last time we started talking about the simulation,\n\n02:34.040 --> 02:35.640\n this time let me ask you,\n\n02:35.640 --> 02:37.480\n do you think there's intelligent life out there\n\n02:37.480 --> 02:38.600\n in the universe?\n\n02:38.600 --> 02:41.640\n I've always maintained my answer to the Fermi paradox.\n\n02:41.640 --> 02:44.440\n I think there has been intelligent life\n\n02:44.440 --> 02:45.880\n elsewhere in the universe.\n\n02:45.880 --> 02:47.920\n So intelligent civilizations existed\n\n02:47.920 --> 02:49.240\n but they've blown themselves up.\n\n02:49.240 --> 02:50.760\n So your general intuition is that\n\n02:50.760 --> 02:54.560\n intelligent civilizations quickly,\n\n02:54.560 --> 02:57.760\n like there's that parameter in the Drake equation.\n\n02:57.760 --> 02:59.640\n Your sense is they don't last very long.\n\n02:59.640 --> 03:00.480\n Yeah.\n\n03:00.480 --> 03:01.560\n How are we doing on that?\n\n03:01.560 --> 03:03.680\n Like, have we lasted pretty good?\n\n03:03.680 --> 03:04.520\n Oh no.\n\n03:04.520 --> 03:05.360\n Are we do?\n\n03:05.360 --> 03:06.200\n Oh yeah.\n\n03:06.200 --> 03:08.120\n I mean, not quite yet.\n\n03:09.280 --> 03:10.440\n Well, it was good to tell you,\n\n03:10.440 --> 03:13.520\n as you'd ask the IQ required to destroy the world\n\n03:13.520 --> 03:15.440\n falls by one point every year.\n\n03:15.440 --> 03:16.280\n Okay.\n\n03:16.280 --> 03:21.120\n Technology democratizes the destruction of the world.\n\n03:21.120 --> 03:23.120\n When can a meme destroy the world?\n\n03:23.120 --> 03:27.280\n It kind of is already, right?\n\n03:27.280 --> 03:28.480\n Somewhat.\n\n03:28.480 --> 03:32.240\n I don't think we've seen anywhere near the worst of it yet.\n\n03:32.240 --> 03:34.000\n Well, it's going to get weird.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:36.480\n Well, maybe a meme can save the world.\n\n03:36.480 --> 03:37.480\n You thought about that?\n\n03:37.480 --> 03:40.800\n The meme Lord Elon Musk fighting on the side of good\n\n03:40.800 --> 03:44.560\n versus the meme Lord of the darkness,\n\n03:44.560 --> 03:48.280\n which is not saying anything bad about Donald Trump,\n\n03:48.280 --> 03:51.720\n but he is the Lord of the meme on the dark side.\n\n03:51.720 --> 03:53.760\n He's a Darth Vader of memes.\n\n03:53.760 --> 03:58.360\n I think in every fairy tale they always end it with,\n\n03:58.360 --> 03:59.920\n and they lived happily ever after.\n\n03:59.920 --> 04:00.960\n And I'm like, please tell me more\n\n04:00.960 --> 04:02.440\n about this happily ever after.\n\n04:02.440 --> 04:05.880\n I've heard 50% of marriages end in divorce.\n\n04:05.880 --> 04:07.840\n Why doesn't your marriage end up there?\n\n04:07.840 --> 04:09.280\n You can't just say happily ever after.\n\n04:09.280 --> 04:12.280\n So it's the thing about destruction\n\n04:12.280 --> 04:14.840\n is it's over after the destruction.\n\n04:14.840 --> 04:18.160\n We have to do everything right in order to avoid it.\n\n04:18.160 --> 04:20.040\n And one thing wrong,\n\n04:20.040 --> 04:21.920\n I mean, actually this is what I really like\n\n04:21.920 --> 04:22.960\n about cryptography.\n\n04:22.960 --> 04:24.600\n Cryptography, it seems like we live in a world\n\n04:24.600 --> 04:29.640\n where the defense wins versus like nuclear weapons.\n\n04:29.640 --> 04:30.920\n The opposite is true.\n\n04:30.920 --> 04:32.960\n It is much easier to build a warhead\n\n04:32.960 --> 04:34.520\n that splits into a hundred little warheads\n\n04:34.520 --> 04:36.440\n than to build something that can, you know,\n\n04:36.440 --> 04:38.880\n take out a hundred little warheads.\n\n04:38.880 --> 04:41.400\n The offense has the advantage there.\n\n04:41.400 --> 04:43.640\n So maybe our future is in crypto, but.\n\n04:44.520 --> 04:45.720\n So cryptography, right.\n\n04:45.720 --> 04:49.760\n The Goliath is the defense.\n\n04:49.760 --> 04:54.280\n And then all the different hackers are the Davids.\n\n04:54.280 --> 04:56.920\n And that equation is flipped for nuclear war.\n\n04:57.840 --> 04:58.800\n Cause there's so many,\n\n04:58.800 --> 05:01.960\n like one nuclear weapon destroys everything essentially.\n\n05:01.960 --> 05:06.960\n Yeah, and it is much easier to attack with a nuclear weapon\n\n05:06.960 --> 05:09.640\n than it is to like the technology required to intercept\n\n05:09.640 --> 05:12.080\n and destroy a rocket is much more complicated\n\n05:12.080 --> 05:13.800\n than the technology required to just, you know,\n\n05:13.800 --> 05:16.400\n orbital trajectory, send a rocket to somebody.\n\n05:17.480 --> 05:18.520\n So, okay.\n\n05:18.520 --> 05:21.880\n Your intuition that there were intelligent civilizations\n\n05:21.880 --> 05:24.360\n out there, but it's very possible\n\n05:24.360 --> 05:26.240\n that they're no longer there.\n\n05:26.240 --> 05:27.640\n That's kind of a sad picture.\n\n05:27.640 --> 05:29.520\n They enter some steady state.\n\n05:29.520 --> 05:31.520\n They all wirehead themselves.\n\n05:31.520 --> 05:32.360\n What's wirehead?\n\n05:33.360 --> 05:35.320\n Stimulate, stimulate their pleasure centers\n\n05:35.320 --> 05:39.680\n and just, you know, live forever in this kind of stasis.\n\n05:39.680 --> 05:42.560\n They become, well, I mean,\n\n05:42.560 --> 05:46.320\n I think the reason I believe this is because where are they?\n\n05:46.320 --> 05:49.800\n If there's some reason they stopped expanding,\n\n05:50.680 --> 05:52.160\n cause otherwise they would have taken over the universe.\n\n05:52.160 --> 05:53.440\n The universe isn't that big.\n\n05:53.440 --> 05:54.280\n Or at least, you know,\n\n05:54.280 --> 05:56.120\n let's just talk about the galaxy, right?\n\n05:56.120 --> 05:57.800\n That's 70,000 light years across.\n\n05:58.720 --> 05:59.920\n I took that number from Star Trek Voyager.\n\n05:59.920 --> 06:04.680\n I don't know how true it is, but yeah, that's not big.\n\n06:04.680 --> 06:07.320\n Right? 70,000 light years is nothing.\n\n06:07.320 --> 06:10.040\n For some possible technology that you can imagine\n\n06:10.040 --> 06:12.320\n that can leverage like wormholes or something like that.\n\n06:12.320 --> 06:13.320\n Or you don't even need wormholes.\n\n06:13.320 --> 06:15.120\n Just a von Neumann probe is enough.\n\n06:15.120 --> 06:18.440\n A von Neumann probe and a million years of sublight travel\n\n06:18.440 --> 06:20.440\n and you'd have taken over the whole universe.\n\n06:20.440 --> 06:22.480\n That clearly didn't happen.\n\n06:22.480 --> 06:24.000\n So something stopped it.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:25.400\n So you mean if you, right,\n\n06:25.400 --> 06:27.040\n for like a few million years,\n\n06:27.040 --> 06:29.880\n if you sent out probes that travel close,\n\n06:29.880 --> 06:30.720\n what's sublight?\n\n06:30.720 --> 06:32.280\n You mean close to the speed of light?\n\n06:32.280 --> 06:33.720\n Let's say 0.1 C.\n\n06:33.720 --> 06:34.800\n And it just spreads.\n\n06:34.800 --> 06:35.640\n Interesting.\n\n06:35.640 --> 06:38.800\n Actually, that's an interesting calculation, huh?\n\n06:38.800 --> 06:40.640\n So what makes you think that we'd be able\n\n06:40.640 --> 06:42.280\n to communicate with them?\n\n06:42.280 --> 06:45.160\n Like, yeah, what's,\n\n06:45.160 --> 06:47.920\n why do you think we would be able to be able\n\n06:47.920 --> 06:50.640\n to comprehend intelligent lives that are out there?\n\n06:51.920 --> 06:54.960\n Like even if they were among us kind of thing,\n\n06:54.960 --> 06:57.600\n like, or even just flying around?\n\n06:57.600 --> 07:01.200\n Well, I mean, that's possible.\n\n07:01.200 --> 07:04.640\n It's possible that there is some sort of prime directive.\n\n07:04.640 --> 07:07.040\n That'd be a really cool universe to live in.\n\n07:07.040 --> 07:08.000\n And there's some reason\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.920\n they're not making themselves visible to us.\n\n07:10.920 --> 07:15.200\n But it makes sense that they would use the same,\n\n07:15.200 --> 07:16.960\n well, at least the same entropy.\n\n07:16.960 --> 07:18.800\n Well, you're implying the same laws of physics.\n\n07:18.800 --> 07:20.800\n I don't know what you mean by entropy in this case.\n\n07:20.800 --> 07:21.920\n Oh, yeah.\n\n07:21.920 --> 07:25.040\n I mean, if entropy is the scarce resource in the universe.\n\n07:25.040 --> 07:26.960\n So what do you think about like Stephen Wolfram\n\n07:26.960 --> 07:28.840\n and everything is a computation?\n\n07:28.840 --> 07:31.440\n And then what if they are traveling through\n\n07:31.440 --> 07:32.640\n this world of computation?\n\n07:32.640 --> 07:34.240\n So if you think of the universe\n\n07:34.240 --> 07:36.600\n as just information processing,\n\n07:36.600 --> 07:40.840\n then what you're referring to with entropy\n\n07:40.840 --> 07:44.240\n and then these pockets of interesting complex computation\n\n07:44.240 --> 07:47.160\n swimming around, how do we know they're not already here?\n\n07:47.160 --> 07:51.040\n How do we know that this,\n\n07:51.040 --> 07:53.040\n like all the different amazing things\n\n07:53.040 --> 07:55.080\n that are full of mystery on earth\n\n07:55.080 --> 07:58.640\n are just like little footprints of intelligence\n\n07:58.640 --> 08:01.160\n from light years away?\n\n08:01.160 --> 08:02.840\n Maybe.\n\n08:02.840 --> 08:05.760\n I mean, I tend to think that as civilizations expand,\n\n08:05.760 --> 08:07.800\n they use more and more energy\n\n08:07.800 --> 08:10.240\n and you can never overcome the problem of waste heat.\n\n08:10.240 --> 08:11.880\n So where is there waste heat?\n\n08:11.880 --> 08:13.560\n So we'd be able to, with our crude methods,\n\n08:13.560 --> 08:18.560\n be able to see like, there's a whole lot of energy here.\n\n08:18.840 --> 08:20.560\n But it could be something we're not,\n\n08:20.560 --> 08:22.480\n I mean, we don't understand dark energy, right?\n\n08:22.480 --> 08:23.560\n Dark matter.\n\n08:23.560 --> 08:26.160\n It could be just stuff we don't understand at all.\n\n08:26.160 --> 08:29.080\n Or they can have a fundamentally different physics,\n\n08:29.080 --> 08:32.200\n you know, like that we just don't even comprehend.\n\n08:32.200 --> 08:33.440\n Well, I think, okay,\n\n08:33.440 --> 08:35.120\n I mean, it depends how far out you wanna go.\n\n08:35.120 --> 08:36.840\n I don't think physics is very different\n\n08:36.840 --> 08:38.440\n on the other side of the galaxy.\n\n08:39.760 --> 08:41.920\n I would suspect that they have,\n\n08:41.920 --> 08:43.680\n I mean, if they're in our universe,\n\n08:43.680 --> 08:45.760\n they have the same physics.\n\n08:45.760 --> 08:47.600\n Well, yeah, that's the assumption we have,\n\n08:47.600 --> 08:50.000\n but there could be like super trippy things\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:57.000\n like our cognition only gets to a slice,\n\n08:57.040 --> 08:59.440\n and all the possible instruments that we can design\n\n08:59.440 --> 09:01.520\n only get to a particular slice of the universe.\n\n09:01.520 --> 09:04.080\n And there's something much like weirder.\n\n09:04.080 --> 09:06.880\n Maybe we can try a thought experiment.\n\n09:06.880 --> 09:10.040\n Would people from the past\n\n09:10.040 --> 09:14.000\n be able to detect the remnants of our,\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.600\n or would we be able to detect our modern civilization?\n\n09:16.600 --> 09:18.840\n I think the answer is obviously yes.\n\n09:18.840 --> 09:20.720\n You mean past from a hundred years ago?\n\n09:20.720 --> 09:22.080\n Well, let's even go back further.\n\n09:22.080 --> 09:24.400\n Let's go to a million years ago, right?\n\n09:24.400 --> 09:26.520\n The humans who were lying around in the desert\n\n09:26.520 --> 09:27.720\n probably didn't even have,\n\n09:27.720 --> 09:29.320\n maybe they just barely had fire.\n\n09:31.360 --> 09:34.080\n They would understand if a 747 flew overhead.\n\n09:35.200 --> 09:43.200\n Oh, in this vicinity, but not if a 747 flew on Mars.\n\n09:43.200 --> 09:45.080\n Like, cause they wouldn't be able to see far,\n\n09:45.080 --> 09:47.240\n cause we're not actually communicating that well\n\n09:47.240 --> 09:48.920\n with the rest of the universe.\n\n09:48.920 --> 09:50.160\n We're doing okay.\n\n09:50.160 --> 09:54.200\n Just sending out random like fifties tracks of music.\n\n09:54.200 --> 09:55.160\n True.\n\n09:55.160 --> 09:57.800\n And yeah, I mean, they'd have to, you know,\n\n09:57.800 --> 10:02.480\n we've only been broadcasting radio waves for 150 years.\n\n10:02.480 --> 10:04.560\n And well, there's your light cone.\n\n10:04.560 --> 10:05.800\n So.\n\n10:05.800 --> 10:06.920\n Yeah. Okay.\n\n10:06.920 --> 10:08.800\n What do you make about all the,\n\n10:08.800 --> 10:13.800\n I recently came across this having talked to David Fravor.\n\n10:14.720 --> 10:16.960\n I don't know if you caught what the videos\n\n10:16.960 --> 10:18.840\n of the Pentagon released\n\n10:18.840 --> 10:23.480\n and the New York Times reporting of the UFO sightings.\n\n10:23.480 --> 10:26.040\n So I kind of looked into it, quote unquote.\n\n10:26.040 --> 10:30.800\n And there's actually been like hundreds\n\n10:30.800 --> 10:33.800\n of thousands of UFO sightings, right?\n\n10:33.800 --> 10:35.960\n And a lot of it you can explain away\n\n10:35.960 --> 10:37.080\n in different kinds of ways.\n\n10:37.080 --> 10:40.160\n So one is it could be interesting physical phenomena.\n\n10:40.160 --> 10:44.640\n Two, it could be people wanting to believe\n\n10:44.640 --> 10:46.760\n and therefore they conjure up a lot of different things\n\n10:46.760 --> 10:48.920\n that just, you know, when you see different kinds of lights,\n\n10:48.920 --> 10:50.760\n some basic physics phenomena,\n\n10:50.760 --> 10:53.640\n and then you just conjure up ideas\n\n10:53.640 --> 10:56.680\n of possible out there mysterious worlds.\n\n10:56.680 --> 10:58.960\n But, you know, it's also possible,\n\n10:58.960 --> 11:02.480\n like you have a case of David Fravor,\n\n11:02.480 --> 11:05.160\n who is a Navy pilot, who's, you know,\n\n11:06.160 --> 11:08.840\n as legit as it gets in terms of humans\n\n11:08.840 --> 11:13.440\n who are able to perceive things in the environment\n\n11:13.440 --> 11:15.320\n and make conclusions,\n\n11:15.320 --> 11:17.600\n whether those things are a threat or not.\n\n11:17.600 --> 11:22.000\n And he and several other pilots saw a thing,\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:23.440\n I don't know if you followed this,\n\n11:23.440 --> 11:26.840\n but they saw a thing that they've since then called TikTok\n\n11:26.840 --> 11:29.520\n that moved in all kinds of weird ways.\n\n11:29.520 --> 11:30.640\n They don't know what it is.\n\n11:30.640 --> 11:35.640\n It could be technology developed by the United States\n\n11:36.640 --> 11:38.040\n and they're just not aware of it\n\n11:38.040 --> 11:40.000\n and the surface level from the Navy, right?\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.280\n It could be different kind of lighting technology\n\n11:42.280 --> 11:45.000\n or drone technology, all that kind of stuff.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:46.560\n It could be the Russians and the Chinese,\n\n11:46.560 --> 11:48.000\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:51.400\n And of course their mind, our mind,\n\n11:51.400 --> 11:54.160\n can also venture into the possibility\n\n11:54.160 --> 11:56.320\n that it's from another world.\n\n11:56.320 --> 11:58.160\n Have you looked into this at all?\n\n11:58.160 --> 11:59.640\n What do you think about it?\n\n11:59.640 --> 12:01.680\n I think all the news is a psyop.\n\n12:01.680 --> 12:05.240\n I think that the most plausible.\n\n12:05.240 --> 12:06.440\n Nothing is real.\n\n12:06.440 --> 12:10.040\n Yeah, I listened to the, I think it was Bob Lazar\n\n12:10.920 --> 12:12.360\n on Joe Rogan.\n\n12:12.360 --> 12:15.840\n And like, I believe everything this guy is saying.\n\n12:15.840 --> 12:18.440\n And then I think that it's probably just some like MKUltra\n\n12:18.440 --> 12:19.680\n kind of thing, you know?\n\n12:20.680 --> 12:21.520\n What do you mean?\n\n12:21.520 --> 12:24.720\n Like they, you know, they made some weird thing\n\n12:24.720 --> 12:26.160\n and they called it an alien spaceship.\n\n12:26.160 --> 12:27.480\n You know, maybe it was just to like\n\n12:27.480 --> 12:29.560\n stimulate young physicists minds.\n\n12:29.560 --> 12:31.040\n We'll tell them it's alien technology\n\n12:31.040 --> 12:33.600\n and we'll see what they come up with, right?\n\n12:33.600 --> 12:36.080\n Do you find any conspiracy theories compelling?\n\n12:36.080 --> 12:38.320\n Like have you pulled at the string\n\n12:38.320 --> 12:42.440\n of the rich complex world of conspiracy theories\n\n12:42.440 --> 12:43.920\n that's out there?\n\n12:43.920 --> 12:46.520\n I think that I've heard a conspiracy theory\n\n12:46.520 --> 12:48.960\n that conspiracy theories were invented by the CIA\n\n12:48.960 --> 12:52.040\n in the 60s to discredit true things.\n\n12:52.040 --> 12:52.880\n Yeah.\n\n12:53.880 --> 12:58.520\n So, you know, you can go to ridiculous conspiracy theories\n\n12:58.520 --> 13:01.000\n like Flat Earth and Pizza Gate.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:05.440\n And, you know, these things are almost to hide\n\n13:05.440 --> 13:08.000\n like conspiracy theories that like,\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.640\n you know, remember when the Chinese like locked up\n\n13:09.640 --> 13:11.360\n the doctors who discovered coronavirus?\n\n13:11.360 --> 13:12.840\n Like I tell people this and I'm like,\n\n13:12.840 --> 13:14.400\n no, no, no, that's not a conspiracy theory.\n\n13:14.400 --> 13:15.920\n That actually happened.\n\n13:15.920 --> 13:18.000\n Do you remember the time that the money used to be backed\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.080\n by gold and now it's backed by nothing?\n\n13:20.080 --> 13:21.680\n This is not a conspiracy theory.\n\n13:21.680 --> 13:23.800\n This actually happened.\n\n13:23.800 --> 13:26.360\n Well, that's one of my worries today\n\n13:26.360 --> 13:31.360\n with the idea of fake news is that when nothing is real,\n\n13:32.880 --> 13:37.600\n then like you dilute the possibility of anything being true\n\n13:37.600 --> 13:41.000\n by conjuring up all kinds of conspiracy theories.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:42.400\n And then you don't know what to believe.\n\n13:42.400 --> 13:46.280\n And then like the idea of truth of objectivity\n\n13:46.280 --> 13:47.840\n is lost completely.\n\n13:47.840 --> 13:50.120\n Everybody has their own truth.\n\n13:50.120 --> 13:53.600\n So you used to control information by censoring it.\n\n13:53.600 --> 13:55.880\n And then the internet happened and governments were like,\n\n13:55.880 --> 13:58.360\n oh shit, we can't censor things anymore.\n\n13:58.360 --> 13:59.580\n I know what we'll do.\n\n14:00.560 --> 14:04.160\n You know, it's the old story of the story of like\n\n14:04.160 --> 14:07.080\n tying a flag with a leprechaun tells you his gold is buried\n\n14:07.080 --> 14:09.080\n and you tie one flag and you make the leprechaun swear\n\n14:09.080 --> 14:10.040\n to not remove the flag.\n\n14:10.040 --> 14:11.720\n And you come back to the field later with a shovel\n\n14:11.720 --> 14:13.120\n and there's flags everywhere.\n\n14:14.640 --> 14:16.320\n That's one way to maintain privacy, right?\n\n14:16.320 --> 14:20.280\n It's like in order to protect the contents\n\n14:20.280 --> 14:21.800\n of this conversation, for example,\n\n14:21.800 --> 14:25.120\n we could just generate like millions of deep,\n\n14:25.120 --> 14:27.560\n fake conversations where you and I talk\n\n14:27.560 --> 14:29.120\n and say random things.\n\n14:29.120 --> 14:30.440\n So this is just one of them\n\n14:30.440 --> 14:32.720\n and nobody knows which one was the real one.\n\n14:32.720 --> 14:34.440\n This could be fake right now.\n\n14:34.440 --> 14:37.240\n Classic steganography technique.\n\n14:37.240 --> 14:39.960\n Okay, another absurd question about intelligent life.\n\n14:39.960 --> 14:43.960\n Cause you know, you're an incredible programmer\n\n14:43.960 --> 14:45.520\n outside of everything else we'll talk about\n\n14:45.520 --> 14:46.780\n just as a programmer.\n\n14:49.320 --> 14:52.960\n Do you think intelligent beings out there,\n\n14:52.960 --> 14:54.520\n the civilizations that were out there,\n\n14:54.520 --> 14:58.240\n had computers and programming?\n\n14:58.240 --> 15:01.440\n Did they, do we naturally have to develop something\n\n15:01.440 --> 15:05.480\n where we engineer machines and are able to encode\n\n15:05.480 --> 15:08.680\n both knowledge into those machines\n\n15:08.680 --> 15:11.720\n and instructions that process that knowledge,\n\n15:11.720 --> 15:14.260\n process that information to make decisions\n\n15:14.260 --> 15:15.680\n and actions and so on?\n\n15:15.680 --> 15:18.320\n And would those programming languages,\n\n15:18.320 --> 15:21.320\n if you think they exist, be at all similar\n\n15:21.320 --> 15:22.760\n to anything we've developed?\n\n15:24.120 --> 15:26.600\n So I don't see that much of a difference\n\n15:26.600 --> 15:29.400\n between quote unquote natural languages\n\n15:29.400 --> 15:31.740\n and programming languages.\n\n15:34.160 --> 15:35.000\n Yeah.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.680\n I think there's so many similarities.\n\n15:36.680 --> 15:39.920\n So when asked the question,\n\n15:39.920 --> 15:42.380\n what do alien languages look like?\n\n15:42.380 --> 15:46.480\n I imagine they're not all that dissimilar from ours.\n\n15:46.480 --> 15:49.280\n And I think translating in and out of them\n\n15:51.560 --> 15:52.920\n wouldn't be that crazy.\n\n15:52.920 --> 15:57.520\n Well, it's difficult to compile like DNA to Python\n\n15:57.520 --> 15:59.160\n and then to C.\n\n15:59.160 --> 16:02.000\n There's a little bit of a gap in the kind of languages\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:06.840\n we use for touring machines\n\n16:06.840 --> 16:10.160\n and the kind of languages nature seems to use a little bit.\n\n16:10.160 --> 16:13.800\n Maybe that's just, we just haven't understood\n\n16:13.800 --> 16:16.440\n the kind of language that nature uses well yet.\n\n16:16.440 --> 16:17.900\n DNA is a CAD model.\n\n16:19.120 --> 16:21.200\n It's not quite a programming language.\n\n16:21.200 --> 16:25.280\n It has no sort of a serial execution.\n\n16:25.280 --> 16:29.480\n It's not quite a, yeah, it's a CAD model.\n\n16:29.480 --> 16:30.920\n So I think in that sense,\n\n16:30.920 --> 16:32.520\n we actually completely understand it.\n\n16:32.520 --> 16:37.300\n The problem is, well, simulating on these CAD models,\n\n16:37.300 --> 16:38.520\n I played with it a bit this year,\n\n16:38.520 --> 16:41.120\n is super computationally intensive.\n\n16:41.120 --> 16:43.720\n If you wanna go down to like the molecular level\n\n16:43.720 --> 16:45.880\n where you need to go to see a lot of these phenomenon\n\n16:45.880 --> 16:46.920\n like protein folding.\n\n16:48.080 --> 16:52.200\n So yeah, it's not that we don't understand it.\n\n16:52.200 --> 16:55.160\n It just requires a whole lot of compute to kind of compile it.\n\n16:55.160 --> 16:56.680\n For our human minds, it's inefficient,\n\n16:56.680 --> 17:00.520\n both for the data representation and for the programming.\n\n17:00.520 --> 17:02.800\n Yeah, it runs well on raw nature.\n\n17:02.800 --> 17:03.880\n It runs well on raw nature.\n\n17:03.880 --> 17:06.840\n And when we try to build emulators or simulators for that,\n\n17:07.840 --> 17:10.640\n well, they're mad slow, but I've tried it.\n\n17:10.640 --> 17:14.280\n It runs in that, yeah, you've commented elsewhere,\n\n17:14.280 --> 17:15.780\n I don't remember where,\n\n17:15.780 --> 17:20.780\n that one of the problems is simulating nature is tough.\n\n17:20.780 --> 17:25.300\n And if you want to sort of deploy a prototype,\n\n17:25.300 --> 17:28.020\n I forgot how you put it, but it made me laugh,\n\n17:28.020 --> 17:30.420\n but animals or humans would need to be involved\n\n17:31.700 --> 17:36.700\n in order to try to run some prototype code on,\n\n17:38.120 --> 17:41.180\n like if we're talking about COVID and viruses and so on,\n\n17:41.180 --> 17:42.900\n if you were trying to engineer\n\n17:42.900 --> 17:45.020\n some kind of defense mechanisms,\n\n17:45.020 --> 17:49.580\n like a vaccine against COVID and all that kind of stuff\n\n17:49.580 --> 17:52.060\n that doing any kind of experimentation,\n\n17:52.060 --> 17:53.980\n like you can with like autonomous vehicles\n\n17:53.980 --> 17:58.980\n would be very technically and ethically costly.\n\n17:59.660 --> 18:00.940\n I'm not sure about that.\n\n18:00.940 --> 18:05.060\n I think you can do tons of crazy biology and test tubes.\n\n18:05.060 --> 18:08.480\n I think my bigger complaint is more,\n\n18:08.480 --> 18:10.120\n oh, the tools are so bad.\n\n18:11.420 --> 18:14.540\n Like literally, you mean like libraries and?\n\n18:14.540 --> 18:16.100\n I don't know, I'm not pipetting shit.\n\n18:16.100 --> 18:20.140\n Like you're handing me a, I got a, no, no, no,\n\n18:20.140 --> 18:21.300\n there has to be some.\n\n18:22.580 --> 18:24.140\n Like automating stuff.\n\n18:24.140 --> 18:28.300\n And like the, yeah, but human biology is messy.\n\n18:28.300 --> 18:29.140\n Like it seems.\n\n18:29.140 --> 18:31.240\n But like, look at those Toronto's videos.\n\n18:31.240 --> 18:32.080\n They were a joke.\n\n18:32.080 --> 18:33.460\n It's like a little gantry.\n\n18:33.460 --> 18:34.660\n It's like little X, Y gantry,\n\n18:34.660 --> 18:36.660\n high school science project with the pipette.\n\n18:36.660 --> 18:38.260\n I'm like, really?\n\n18:38.260 --> 18:39.220\n Gotta be something better.\n\n18:39.220 --> 18:41.420\n You can't build like nice microfluidics\n\n18:41.420 --> 18:45.300\n and I can program the computation to bio interface.\n\n18:45.300 --> 18:47.180\n I mean, this is gonna happen.\n\n18:47.180 --> 18:50.020\n But like right now, if you are asking me\n\n18:50.020 --> 18:53.580\n to pipette 50 milliliters of solution, I'm out.\n\n18:54.460 --> 18:55.460\n This is so crude.\n\n18:55.460 --> 18:56.700\n Yeah.\n\n18:56.700 --> 18:59.980\n Okay, let's get all the crazy out of the way.\n\n18:59.980 --> 19:02.260\n So a bunch of people asked me,\n\n19:02.260 --> 19:05.060\n since we talked about the simulation last time,\n\n19:05.060 --> 19:06.860\n we talked about hacking the simulation.\n\n19:06.860 --> 19:09.900\n Do you have any updates, any insights\n\n19:09.900 --> 19:13.740\n about how we might be able to go about hacking simulation\n\n19:13.740 --> 19:16.260\n if we indeed do live in a simulation?\n\n19:17.180 --> 19:19.900\n I think a lot of people misinterpreted\n\n19:19.900 --> 19:22.420\n the point of that South by talk.\n\n19:22.420 --> 19:23.500\n The point of the South by talk\n\n19:23.500 --> 19:25.560\n was not literally to hack the simulation.\n\n19:26.720 --> 19:31.720\n I think that this is an idea is literally just,\n\n19:33.520 --> 19:34.580\n I think theoretical physics.\n\n19:34.580 --> 19:39.580\n I think that's the whole goal, right?\n\n19:39.900 --> 19:42.300\n You want your grand unified theory, but then, okay,\n\n19:42.300 --> 19:45.140\n build a grand unified theory search for exploits, right?\n\n19:45.140 --> 19:47.640\n I think we're nowhere near actually there yet.\n\n19:47.640 --> 19:50.180\n My hope with that was just more to like,\n\n19:51.500 --> 19:52.740\n are you people kidding me\n\n19:52.740 --> 19:54.980\n with the things you spend time thinking about?\n\n19:54.980 --> 19:58.020\n Do you understand like kind of how small you are?\n\n19:58.020 --> 20:02.540\n You are bytes and God's computer, really?\n\n20:02.540 --> 20:06.700\n And the things that people get worked up about, you know?\n\n20:06.700 --> 20:10.060\n So basically, it was more a message\n\n20:10.060 --> 20:12.540\n of we should humble ourselves.\n\n20:12.540 --> 20:17.540\n That we get to, like what are we humans in this byte code?\n\n20:19.460 --> 20:22.380\n Yeah, and not just humble ourselves,\n\n20:22.380 --> 20:24.900\n but like I'm not trying to like make people guilty\n\n20:24.900 --> 20:25.740\n or anything like that.\n\n20:25.740 --> 20:27.260\n I'm trying to say like, literally,\n\n20:27.260 --> 20:30.200\n look at what you are spending time on, right?\n\n20:30.200 --> 20:31.040\n What are you referring to?\n\n20:31.040 --> 20:32.460\n You're referring to the Kardashians?\n\n20:32.460 --> 20:34.140\n What are we talking about?\n\n20:34.140 --> 20:34.980\n Twitter?\n\n20:34.980 --> 20:38.060\n No, the Kardashians, everyone knows that's kind of fun.\n\n20:38.060 --> 20:42.980\n I'm referring more to like the economy, you know?\n\n20:42.980 --> 20:47.980\n This idea that we gotta up our stock price.\n\n20:50.720 --> 20:55.380\n Or what is the goal function of humanity?\n\n20:55.380 --> 20:57.600\n You don't like the game of capitalism?\n\n20:57.600 --> 20:59.340\n Like you don't like the games we've constructed\n\n20:59.340 --> 21:00.660\n for ourselves as humans?\n\n21:00.660 --> 21:02.860\n I'm a big fan of capitalism.\n\n21:02.860 --> 21:05.120\n I don't think that's really the game we're playing right now.\n\n21:05.120 --> 21:07.260\n I think we're playing a different game\n\n21:07.260 --> 21:08.660\n where the rules are rigged.\n\n21:10.300 --> 21:12.580\n Okay, which games are interesting to you\n\n21:12.580 --> 21:14.780\n that we humans have constructed and which aren't?\n\n21:14.780 --> 21:18.380\n Which are productive and which are not?\n\n21:18.380 --> 21:21.880\n Actually, maybe that's the real point of the talk.\n\n21:21.880 --> 21:25.100\n It's like, stop playing these fake human games.\n\n21:25.100 --> 21:26.780\n There's a real game here.\n\n21:26.780 --> 21:28.660\n We can play the real game.\n\n21:28.660 --> 21:31.260\n The real game is, you know, nature wrote the rules.\n\n21:31.260 --> 21:32.540\n This is a real game.\n\n21:32.540 --> 21:35.180\n There still is a game to play.\n\n21:35.180 --> 21:36.940\n But if you look at, sorry to interrupt,\n\n21:36.940 --> 21:38.420\n I don't know if you've seen the Instagram account,\n\n21:38.420 --> 21:40.220\n nature is metal.\n\n21:40.220 --> 21:42.820\n The game that nature seems to be playing\n\n21:42.820 --> 21:47.340\n is a lot more cruel than we humans want to put up with.\n\n21:47.340 --> 21:49.520\n Or at least we see it as cruel.\n\n21:49.520 --> 21:52.780\n It's like the bigger thing eats the smaller thing\n\n21:53.660 --> 21:58.180\n and does it to impress another big thing\n\n21:58.180 --> 22:00.460\n so it can mate with that thing.\n\n22:00.460 --> 22:01.300\n And that's it.\n\n22:01.300 --> 22:04.040\n That seems to be the entirety of it.\n\n22:04.040 --> 22:07.260\n Well, there's no art, there's no music,\n\n22:07.260 --> 22:10.860\n there's no comma AI, there's no comma one,\n\n22:10.860 --> 22:14.940\n no comma two, no George Hots with his brilliant talks\n\n22:14.940 --> 22:17.020\n at South by Southwest.\n\n22:17.020 --> 22:17.860\n I disagree, though.\n\n22:17.860 --> 22:19.620\n I disagree that this is what nature is.\n\n22:19.620 --> 22:24.620\n I think nature just provided basically a open world MMORPG.\n\n22:26.780 --> 22:29.860\n And, you know, here it's open world.\n\n22:29.860 --> 22:31.100\n I mean, if that's the game you want to play,\n\n22:31.100 --> 22:32.260\n you can play that game.\n\n22:32.260 --> 22:33.780\n But isn't that beautiful?\n\n22:33.780 --> 22:35.580\n I don't know if you played Diablo.\n\n22:35.580 --> 22:39.420\n They used to have, I think, cow level where it's...\n\n22:39.420 --> 22:44.420\n So everybody will go just, they figured out this,\n\n22:44.420 --> 22:48.420\n like the best way to gain like experience points\n\n22:48.420 --> 22:51.020\n is to just slaughter cows over and over and over.\n\n22:52.180 --> 22:55.900\n And so they figured out this little sub game\n\n22:55.900 --> 22:58.800\n within the bigger game that this is the most efficient way\n\n22:58.800 --> 22:59.900\n to get experience points.\n\n22:59.900 --> 23:01.860\n And everybody somehow agreed\n\n23:01.860 --> 23:04.460\n that getting experience points in RPG context\n\n23:04.460 --> 23:06.500\n where you always want to be getting more stuff,\n\n23:06.500 --> 23:09.140\n more skills, more levels, keep advancing.\n\n23:09.140 --> 23:10.440\n That seems to be good.\n\n23:10.440 --> 23:14.740\n So might as well sacrifice actual enjoyment\n\n23:14.740 --> 23:17.640\n of playing a game, exploring a world,\n\n23:17.640 --> 23:21.580\n and spending like hundreds of hours of your time\n\n23:21.580 --> 23:22.420\n at cow level.\n\n23:22.420 --> 23:25.540\n I mean, the number of hours I spent in cow level,\n\n23:26.400 --> 23:28.140\n I'm not like the most impressive person\n\n23:28.140 --> 23:30.460\n because people have spent probably thousands of hours there,\n\n23:30.460 --> 23:31.580\n but it's ridiculous.\n\n23:31.580 --> 23:35.220\n So that's a little absurd game that brought me joy\n\n23:35.220 --> 23:37.500\n in some weird dopamine drug kind of way.\n\n23:37.500 --> 23:40.060\n So you don't like those games.\n\n23:40.060 --> 23:45.060\n You don't think that's us humans feeling the nature.\n\n23:46.500 --> 23:47.340\n I think so.\n\n23:47.340 --> 23:49.640\n And that was the point of the talk.\n\n23:49.640 --> 23:50.480\n Yeah.\n\n23:50.480 --> 23:51.460\n So how do we hack it then?\n\n23:51.460 --> 23:52.740\n Well, I want to live forever.\n\n23:52.740 --> 23:55.820\n And I want to live forever.\n\n23:55.820 --> 23:56.780\n And this is the goal.\n\n23:56.780 --> 23:59.220\n Well, that's a game against nature.\n\n23:59.220 --> 24:02.600\n Yeah, immortality is the good objective function to you?\n\n24:03.540 --> 24:05.100\n I mean, start there and then you can do whatever else\n\n24:05.100 --> 24:07.380\n you want because you got a long time.\n\n24:07.380 --> 24:10.740\n What if immortality makes the game just totally not fun?\n\n24:10.740 --> 24:13.860\n I mean, like, why do you assume immortality\n\n24:13.860 --> 24:18.160\n is somehow a good objective function?\n\n24:18.160 --> 24:19.940\n It's not immortality that I want.\n\n24:19.940 --> 24:22.580\n A true immortality where I could not die,\n\n24:22.580 --> 24:25.020\n I would prefer what we have right now.\n\n24:25.020 --> 24:27.180\n But I want to choose my own death, of course.\n\n24:27.180 --> 24:29.840\n I don't want nature to decide when I die,\n\n24:29.840 --> 24:30.780\n I'm going to win.\n\n24:30.780 --> 24:31.780\n I'm going to be you.\n\n24:33.100 --> 24:36.920\n And then at some point, if you choose commit suicide,\n\n24:36.920 --> 24:40.420\n like how long do you think you'd live?\n\n24:41.700 --> 24:43.140\n Until I get bored.\n\n24:43.140 --> 24:48.060\n See, I don't think people like brilliant people like you\n\n24:48.060 --> 24:52.380\n that really ponder living a long time\n\n24:52.380 --> 24:57.380\n are really considering how meaningless life becomes.\n\n24:58.620 --> 25:01.060\n Well, I want to know everything and then I'm ready to die.\n\n25:03.620 --> 25:04.460\n As long as there's...\n\n25:04.460 --> 25:05.280\n Yeah, but why do you want,\n\n25:05.280 --> 25:06.940\n isn't it possible that you want to know everything\n\n25:06.940 --> 25:09.700\n because it's finite?\n\n25:09.700 --> 25:12.220\n Like the reason you want to know quote unquote everything\n\n25:12.220 --> 25:16.380\n is because you don't have enough time to know everything.\n\n25:16.380 --> 25:18.780\n And once you have unlimited time,\n\n25:18.780 --> 25:22.220\n then you realize like, why do anything?\n\n25:22.220 --> 25:24.060\n Like why learn anything?\n\n25:25.140 --> 25:27.100\n I want to know everything and then I'm ready to die.\n\n25:27.100 --> 25:28.460\n So you have, yeah.\n\n25:28.460 --> 25:30.940\n It's not a, like, it's a terminal value.\n\n25:30.940 --> 25:34.740\n It's not in service of anything else.\n\n25:34.740 --> 25:37.900\n I'm conscious of the possibility, this is not a certainty,\n\n25:37.900 --> 25:41.800\n but the possibility of that engine of curiosity\n\n25:41.800 --> 25:44.340\n that you're speaking to is actually\n\n25:47.100 --> 25:49.780\n a symptom of the finiteness of life.\n\n25:49.780 --> 25:54.780\n Like without that finiteness, your curiosity would vanish.\n\n25:55.060 --> 25:57.000\n Like a morning fog.\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:57.840\n All right, cool.\n\n25:57.840 --> 25:59.300\n Bukowski talked about love like that.\n\n25:59.300 --> 26:01.340\n Then let me solve immortality\n\n26:01.340 --> 26:02.900\n and let me change the thing in my brain\n\n26:02.900 --> 26:04.700\n that reminds me of the fact that I'm immortal,\n\n26:04.700 --> 26:06.260\n tells me that life is finite shit.\n\n26:06.260 --> 26:09.060\n Maybe I'll have it tell me that life ends next week.\n\n26:09.060 --> 26:10.660\n Right?\n\n26:10.660 --> 26:12.660\n I'm okay with some self manipulation like that.\n\n26:12.660 --> 26:14.420\n I'm okay with deceiving myself.\n\n26:14.420 --> 26:17.020\n Oh, Rika, changing the code.\n\n26:17.020 --> 26:18.300\n Yeah, well, if that's the problem, right?\n\n26:18.300 --> 26:20.580\n If the problem is that I will no longer have that,\n\n26:20.580 --> 26:24.460\n that curiosity, I'd like to have backup copies of myself,\n\n26:24.460 --> 26:27.460\n which I check in with occasionally\n\n26:27.460 --> 26:29.240\n to make sure they're okay with the trajectory\n\n26:29.240 --> 26:31.000\n and they can kind of override it.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.180\n Maybe a nice, like, I think of like those wave nets,\n\n26:33.180 --> 26:35.180\n those like logarithmic go back to the copies.\n\n26:35.180 --> 26:36.700\n Yeah, but sometimes it's not reversible.\n\n26:36.700 --> 26:39.980\n Like I've done this with video games.\n\n26:39.980 --> 26:41.620\n Once you figure out the cheat code\n\n26:41.620 --> 26:43.940\n or like you look up how to cheat old school,\n\n26:43.940 --> 26:46.860\n like single player, it ruins the game for you.\n\n26:46.860 --> 26:47.700\n Absolutely.\n\n26:47.700 --> 26:48.540\n It ruins that feeling.\n\n26:48.540 --> 26:51.900\n But again, that just means our brain manipulation\n\n26:51.900 --> 26:53.260\n technology is not good enough yet.\n\n26:53.260 --> 26:54.700\n Remove that cheat code from your brain.\n\n26:54.700 --> 26:55.820\n Here you go.\n\n26:55.820 --> 26:59.380\n So it's also possible that if we figure out immortality,\n\n27:00.500 --> 27:03.460\n that all of us will kill ourselves\n\n27:03.460 --> 27:06.100\n before we advance far enough\n\n27:06.100 --> 27:08.820\n to be able to revert the change.\n\n27:08.820 --> 27:11.900\n I'm not killing myself till I know everything, so.\n\n27:11.900 --> 27:15.020\n That's what you say now, because your life is finite.\n\n27:15.020 --> 27:19.060\n You know, I think yes, self modifying systems gets,\n\n27:19.060 --> 27:21.020\n comes up with all these hairy complexities\n\n27:21.020 --> 27:23.020\n and can I promise that I'll do it perfectly?\n\n27:23.020 --> 27:25.920\n No, but I think I can put good safety structures in place.\n\n27:27.180 --> 27:29.740\n So that talk and your thinking here\n\n27:29.740 --> 27:34.740\n is not literally referring to a simulation\n\n27:36.180 --> 27:40.520\n and that our universe is a kind of computer program\n\n27:40.520 --> 27:42.240\n running on a computer.\n\n27:42.240 --> 27:45.180\n That's more of a thought experiment.\n\n27:45.180 --> 27:50.180\n Do you also think of the potential of the sort of Bostrom,\n\n27:51.780 --> 27:56.780\n Elon Musk and others that talk about an actual program\n\n27:57.820 --> 27:59.700\n that simulates our universe?\n\n27:59.700 --> 28:01.980\n Oh, I don't doubt that we're in a simulation.\n\n28:01.980 --> 28:05.300\n I just think that it's not quite that important.\n\n28:05.300 --> 28:06.940\n I mean, I'm interested only in simulation theory\n\n28:06.940 --> 28:09.740\n as far as like it gives me power over nature.\n\n28:09.740 --> 28:13.140\n If it's totally unfalsifiable, then who cares?\n\n28:13.140 --> 28:15.300\n I mean, what do you think that experiment would look like?\n\n28:15.300 --> 28:17.740\n Like somebody on Twitter asks,\n\n28:17.740 --> 28:20.780\n asks George what signs we would look for\n\n28:20.780 --> 28:22.980\n to know whether or not we're in the simulation,\n\n28:22.980 --> 28:25.880\n which is exactly what you're asking is like,\n\n28:25.880 --> 28:29.500\n the step that precedes the step of knowing\n\n28:29.500 --> 28:32.200\n how to get more power from this knowledge\n\n28:32.200 --> 28:35.220\n is to get an indication that there's some power to be gained.\n\n28:35.220 --> 28:37.900\n So get an indication that there,\n\n28:37.900 --> 28:42.100\n you can discover and exploit cracks in the simulation\n\n28:42.100 --> 28:45.340\n or it doesn't have to be in the physics of the universe.\n\n28:45.340 --> 28:46.720\n Yeah.\n\n28:46.720 --> 28:50.640\n Show me, I mean, like a memory leak could be cool.\n\n28:51.620 --> 28:54.000\n Like some scrying technology, you know?\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:55.260\n What kind of technology?\n\n28:55.260 --> 28:56.220\n Scrying?\n\n28:56.220 --> 28:57.060\n What's that?\n\n28:57.060 --> 28:58.460\n Oh, that's a weird,\n\n28:58.460 --> 29:03.460\n scrying is the paranormal ability to like remote viewing,\n\n29:03.460 --> 29:06.980\n like being able to see somewhere where you're not.\n\n29:08.220 --> 29:10.100\n So, you know, I don't think you can do it\n\n29:10.100 --> 29:11.220\n by chanting in a room,\n\n29:11.220 --> 29:14.680\n but if we could find, it's a memory leak, basically.\n\n29:16.300 --> 29:17.300\n It's a memory leak.\n\n29:17.300 --> 29:19.980\n Yeah, you're able to access parts you're not supposed to.\n\n29:19.980 --> 29:20.820\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n29:20.820 --> 29:22.100\n And thereby discover a shortcut.\n\n29:22.100 --> 29:24.720\n Yeah, maybe memory leak means the other thing as well,\n\n29:24.720 --> 29:25.560\n but I mean like, yeah,\n\n29:25.560 --> 29:28.100\n like an ability to read arbitrary memory, right?\n\n29:28.100 --> 29:29.820\n And that one's not that horrifying, right?\n\n29:29.820 --> 29:31.420\n The right ones start to be horrifying.\n\n29:31.420 --> 29:32.260\n Read, right.\n\n29:32.260 --> 29:34.900\n It's the reading is not the problem.\n\n29:34.900 --> 29:37.220\n Yeah, it's like Heartfleet for the universe.\n\n29:37.220 --> 29:40.740\n Oh boy, the writing is a big, big problem.\n\n29:40.740 --> 29:42.040\n It's a big problem.\n\n29:43.060 --> 29:44.620\n It's the moment you can write anything,\n\n29:44.620 --> 29:46.480\n even if it's just random noise.\n\n29:47.740 --> 29:49.180\n That's terrifying.\n\n29:49.180 --> 29:51.560\n I mean, even without that,\n\n29:51.560 --> 29:52.580\n like even some of the, you know,\n\n29:52.580 --> 29:54.980\n the nanotech stuff that's coming, I think is.\n\n29:57.140 --> 29:58.340\n I don't know if you're paying attention,\n\n29:58.340 --> 30:00.500\n but actually Eric Weistand came out\n\n30:00.500 --> 30:02.260\n with the theory of everything.\n\n30:02.260 --> 30:03.580\n I mean, that came out.\n\n30:03.580 --> 30:05.460\n He's been working on a theory of everything\n\n30:05.460 --> 30:08.060\n in the physics world called geometric unity.\n\n30:08.060 --> 30:11.700\n And then for me, from computer science person like you,\n\n30:11.700 --> 30:14.220\n Steven Wolfram's theory of everything,\n\n30:14.220 --> 30:17.660\n of like hypergraphs is super interesting and beautiful,\n\n30:17.660 --> 30:19.460\n but not from a physics perspective,\n\n30:19.460 --> 30:20.940\n but from a computational perspective.\n\n30:20.940 --> 30:23.020\n I don't know, have you paid attention to any of that?\n\n30:23.020 --> 30:26.440\n So again, like what would make me pay attention\n\n30:26.440 --> 30:29.540\n and like why like I hate string theory is,\n\n30:29.540 --> 30:31.780\n okay, make a testable prediction, right?\n\n30:31.780 --> 30:33.700\n I'm only interested in,\n\n30:33.700 --> 30:36.060\n I'm not interested in theories for their intrinsic beauty.\n\n30:36.060 --> 30:37.060\n I'm interested in theories\n\n30:37.060 --> 30:38.900\n that give me power over the universe.\n\n30:39.900 --> 30:42.340\n So if these theories do, I'm very interested.\n\n30:43.220 --> 30:45.100\n Can I just say how beautiful that is?\n\n30:45.100 --> 30:47.140\n Because a lot of physicists say,\n\n30:47.140 --> 30:49.980\n I'm interested in experimental validation\n\n30:49.980 --> 30:52.940\n and they skip out the part where they say\n\n30:52.940 --> 30:55.500\n to give me more power in the universe.\n\n30:55.500 --> 30:57.500\n I just love the.\n\n30:57.500 --> 30:59.780\n No, I want. The clarity of that.\n\n30:59.780 --> 31:02.020\n I want 100 gigahertz processors.\n\n31:02.020 --> 31:04.120\n I want transistors that are smaller than atoms.\n\n31:04.120 --> 31:05.600\n I want like power.\n\n31:08.100 --> 31:10.580\n That's true.\n\n31:10.580 --> 31:12.460\n And that's where people from aliens\n\n31:12.460 --> 31:14.420\n to this kind of technology where people are worried\n\n31:14.420 --> 31:19.320\n that governments, like who owns that power?\n\n31:19.320 --> 31:20.780\n Is it George Harts?\n\n31:20.780 --> 31:25.020\n Is it thousands of distributed hackers across the world?\n\n31:25.020 --> 31:26.580\n Is it governments?\n\n31:26.580 --> 31:28.660\n Is it Mark Zuckerberg?\n\n31:28.660 --> 31:32.500\n There's a lot of people that,\n\n31:32.500 --> 31:35.540\n I don't know if anyone trusts any one individual with power.\n\n31:35.540 --> 31:37.380\n So they're always worried.\n\n31:37.380 --> 31:39.340\n It's the beauty of blockchains.\n\n31:39.340 --> 31:43.140\n That's the beauty of blockchains, which we'll talk about.\n\n31:43.140 --> 31:46.220\n On Twitter, somebody pointed me to a story,\n\n31:46.220 --> 31:49.300\n a bunch of people pointed me to a story a few months ago\n\n31:49.300 --> 31:51.660\n where you went into a restaurant in New York.\n\n31:51.660 --> 31:53.660\n And you can correct me if any of this is wrong.\n\n31:53.660 --> 31:56.580\n And ran into a bunch of folks from a company\n\n31:56.580 --> 32:00.580\n in a crypto company who are trying to scale up Ethereum.\n\n32:01.780 --> 32:03.300\n And they had a technical deadline\n\n32:03.300 --> 32:07.380\n related to solidity to OVM compiler.\n\n32:07.380 --> 32:09.660\n So these are all Ethereum technologies.\n\n32:09.660 --> 32:13.440\n So you stepped in, they recognized you,\n\n32:14.700 --> 32:16.220\n pulled you aside, explained their problem.\n\n32:16.220 --> 32:19.540\n And you stepped in and helped them solve the problem,\n\n32:19.540 --> 32:23.100\n thereby creating legend status story.\n\n32:23.100 --> 32:28.100\n So can you tell me the story in a little more detail?\n\n32:28.980 --> 32:30.620\n It seems kind of incredible.\n\n32:31.540 --> 32:32.380\n Did this happen?\n\n32:32.380 --> 32:34.060\n Yeah, yeah, it's a true story, it's a true story.\n\n32:34.060 --> 32:36.620\n I mean, they wrote a very flattering account of it.\n\n32:39.340 --> 32:43.820\n So Optimism is the company called Optimism,\n\n32:43.820 --> 32:45.420\n spin off of Plasma.\n\n32:45.420 --> 32:47.820\n They're trying to build L2 solutions on Ethereum.\n\n32:47.820 --> 32:52.620\n So right now, every Ethereum node\n\n32:52.620 --> 32:56.420\n has to run every transaction on the Ethereum network.\n\n32:56.420 --> 32:58.540\n And this kind of doesn't scale, right?\n\n32:58.540 --> 33:00.020\n Because if you have N computers,\n\n33:00.020 --> 33:02.340\n well, if that becomes two N computers,\n\n33:02.340 --> 33:05.420\n you actually still get the same amount of compute, right?\n\n33:05.420 --> 33:07.740\n This is like all of one scaling\n\n33:09.120 --> 33:10.140\n because they all have to run it.\n\n33:10.140 --> 33:12.840\n Okay, fine, you get more blockchain security,\n\n33:12.840 --> 33:15.380\n but like, blockchain is already so secure.\n\n33:15.380 --> 33:17.780\n Can we trade some of that off for speed?\n\n33:17.780 --> 33:20.500\n So that's kind of what these L2 solutions are.\n\n33:20.500 --> 33:23.020\n They built this thing, which kind of,\n\n33:23.020 --> 33:26.300\n kind of sandbox for Ethereum contracts.\n\n33:26.300 --> 33:28.200\n So they can run it in this L2 world\n\n33:28.200 --> 33:30.900\n and it can't do certain things in L world, in L1.\n\n33:30.900 --> 33:32.420\n Can I ask you for some definitions?\n\n33:32.420 --> 33:33.420\n What's L2?\n\n33:33.420 --> 33:34.840\n Oh, L2 is layer two.\n\n33:34.840 --> 33:37.180\n So L1 is like the base Ethereum chain.\n\n33:37.180 --> 33:40.920\n And then layer two is like a computational layer\n\n33:40.920 --> 33:44.420\n that runs elsewhere,\n\n33:44.420 --> 33:47.680\n but still is kind of secured by layer one.\n\n33:47.680 --> 33:49.720\n And I'm sure a lot of people know,\n\n33:49.720 --> 33:51.940\n but Ethereum is a cryptocurrency,\n\n33:51.940 --> 33:53.720\n probably one of the most popular cryptocurrency\n\n33:53.720 --> 33:55.320\n second to Bitcoin.\n\n33:55.320 --> 33:58.800\n And a lot of interesting technological innovation there.\n\n33:58.800 --> 34:03.240\n Maybe you could also slip in whenever you talk about this\n\n34:03.240 --> 34:06.380\n and things that are exciting to you in the Ethereum space.\n\n34:06.380 --> 34:07.800\n And why Ethereum?\n\n34:07.800 --> 34:11.120\n Well, I mean, Bitcoin is not Turing complete.\n\n34:12.260 --> 34:13.820\n Ethereum is not technically Turing complete\n\n34:13.820 --> 34:16.040\n with the gas limit, but close enough.\n\n34:16.040 --> 34:16.880\n With the gas limit?\n\n34:16.880 --> 34:19.080\n What's the gas limit, resources?\n\n34:19.080 --> 34:21.180\n Yeah, I mean, no computer is actually Turing complete.\n\n34:21.180 --> 34:22.020\n Right.\n\n34:23.160 --> 34:24.720\n You're gonna find out RAM, you know?\n\n34:24.720 --> 34:25.560\n I can actually solve the whole thing.\n\n34:25.560 --> 34:26.720\n What's the word gas limit?\n\n34:26.720 --> 34:28.660\n You just have so many brilliant words.\n\n34:28.660 --> 34:29.500\n I'm not even gonna ask.\n\n34:29.500 --> 34:32.220\n That's not my word, that's Ethereum's word.\n\n34:32.220 --> 34:33.060\n Gas limit.\n\n34:33.060 --> 34:35.360\n Ethereum, you have to spend gas per instruction.\n\n34:35.360 --> 34:37.820\n So like different op codes use different amounts of gas\n\n34:37.820 --> 34:40.680\n and you buy gas with ether to prevent people\n\n34:40.680 --> 34:42.740\n from basically DDoSing the network.\n\n34:42.740 --> 34:45.440\n So Bitcoin is proof of work.\n\n34:45.440 --> 34:47.120\n And then what's Ethereum?\n\n34:47.120 --> 34:48.360\n It's also proof of work.\n\n34:48.360 --> 34:49.960\n They're working on some proof of stake,\n\n34:49.960 --> 34:51.040\n Ethereum 2.0 stuff.\n\n34:51.040 --> 34:52.720\n But right now it's proof of work.\n\n34:52.720 --> 34:54.700\n It uses a different hash function from Bitcoin.\n\n34:54.700 --> 34:57.340\n That's more ASIC resistance, because you need RAM.\n\n34:57.340 --> 34:59.960\n So we're all talking about Ethereum 1.0.\n\n34:59.960 --> 35:03.840\n So what were they trying to do to scale this whole process?\n\n35:03.840 --> 35:07.800\n So they were like, well, if we could run contracts elsewhere\n\n35:07.800 --> 35:10.480\n and then only save the results of that computation,\n\n35:13.120 --> 35:14.680\n well, we don't actually have to do the compute on the chain.\n\n35:14.680 --> 35:15.680\n We can do the compute off chain\n\n35:15.680 --> 35:17.440\n and just post what the results are.\n\n35:17.440 --> 35:18.800\n Now, the problem with that is,\n\n35:18.800 --> 35:21.120\n well, somebody could lie about what the results are.\n\n35:21.120 --> 35:23.240\n So you need a resolution mechanism.\n\n35:23.240 --> 35:26.500\n And the resolution mechanism can be really expensive\n\n35:26.500 --> 35:29.000\n because you just have to make sure\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.140\n that the person who is saying,\n\n35:31.140 --> 35:33.800\n look, I swear that this is the real computation.\n\n35:33.800 --> 35:36.640\n I'm staking $10,000 on that fact.\n\n35:36.640 --> 35:39.000\n And if you prove it wrong,\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:42.820\n yeah, it might cost you $3,000 in gas fees to prove wrong,\n\n35:42.820 --> 35:44.800\n but you'll get the $10,000 bounty.\n\n35:44.800 --> 35:47.740\n So you can secure using those kinds of systems.\n\n35:47.740 --> 35:52.500\n So it's effectively a sandbox, which runs contracts.\n\n35:52.500 --> 35:55.600\n And like, it's like any kind of normal sandbox,\n\n35:55.600 --> 35:57.960\n you have to like replace syscalls\n\n35:57.960 --> 36:00.580\n with calls into the hypervisor.\n\n36:02.920 --> 36:05.080\n Sandbox, syscalls, hypervisor.\n\n36:05.080 --> 36:06.680\n What do these things mean?\n\n36:06.680 --> 36:09.240\n As long as it's interesting to talk about.\n\n36:09.240 --> 36:11.280\n Yeah, I mean, you can take like the Chrome sandbox\n\n36:11.280 --> 36:12.720\n is maybe the one to think about, right?\n\n36:12.720 --> 36:16.000\n So the Chrome process that's doing a rendering,\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:18.800\n can't, for example, read a file from the file system.\n\n36:18.800 --> 36:21.800\n It has, if it tries to make an open syscall in Linux,\n\n36:21.800 --> 36:23.720\n the open syscall, you can't make it open syscall,\n\n36:23.720 --> 36:24.780\n no, no, no.\n\n36:24.780 --> 36:29.160\n You have to request from the kind of hypervisor process\n\n36:29.160 --> 36:31.680\n or like, I don't know what it's called in Chrome,\n\n36:31.680 --> 36:36.400\n but the, hey, could you open this file for me?\n\n36:36.400 --> 36:37.520\n And then it does all these checks\n\n36:37.520 --> 36:39.200\n and then it passes the file handle back in\n\n36:39.200 --> 36:40.160\n if it's approved.\n\n36:41.160 --> 36:42.640\n So that's, yeah.\n\n36:42.640 --> 36:45.320\n So what's the, in the context of Ethereum,\n\n36:45.320 --> 36:47.200\n what are the boundaries of the sandbox\n\n36:47.200 --> 36:48.400\n that we're talking about?\n\n36:48.400 --> 36:50.800\n Well, like one of the calls that you,\n\n36:50.800 --> 36:53.960\n actually reading and writing any state\n\n36:53.960 --> 36:55.480\n to the Ethereum contract,\n\n36:55.480 --> 36:57.040\n or to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n36:58.720 --> 37:01.060\n Writing state is one of those calls\n\n37:01.060 --> 37:04.500\n that you're going to have to sandbox in layer two,\n\n37:04.500 --> 37:08.120\n because if you let layer two just arbitrarily write\n\n37:08.120 --> 37:09.480\n to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n37:09.480 --> 37:14.480\n So layer two is really sitting on top of layer one.\n\n37:15.120 --> 37:17.160\n So you're going to have a lot of different kinds of ideas\n\n37:17.160 --> 37:18.680\n that you can play with.\n\n37:18.680 --> 37:21.360\n And they're all, they're not fundamentally changing\n\n37:21.360 --> 37:25.140\n the source code level of Ethereum.\n\n37:25.140 --> 37:28.900\n Well, you have to replace a bunch of calls\n\n37:28.900 --> 37:31.120\n with calls into the hypervisor.\n\n37:31.120 --> 37:33.840\n So instead of doing the syscall directly,\n\n37:33.840 --> 37:37.360\n you replace it with a call to the hypervisor.\n\n37:37.360 --> 37:39.320\n So originally they were doing this\n\n37:39.320 --> 37:43.520\n by first running the, so Solidity is the language\n\n37:43.520 --> 37:45.440\n that most Ethereum contracts are written in.\n\n37:45.440 --> 37:47.320\n It compiles to a bytecode.\n\n37:47.320 --> 37:50.040\n And then they wrote this thing they called the transpiler.\n\n37:50.040 --> 37:52.440\n And the transpiler took the bytecode\n\n37:52.440 --> 37:56.000\n and it transpiled it into OVM safe bytecode.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:57.520\n Basically bytecode that didn't make any\n\n37:57.520 --> 37:58.800\n of those restricted syscalls\n\n37:58.800 --> 38:00.700\n and added the calls to the hypervisor.\n\n38:01.680 --> 38:04.640\n This transpiler was a 3000 line mess.\n\n38:05.640 --> 38:07.100\n And it's hard to do.\n\n38:07.100 --> 38:09.060\n It's hard to do if you're trying to do it like that,\n\n38:09.060 --> 38:12.200\n because you have to kind of like deconstruct the bytecode,\n\n38:12.200 --> 38:15.360\n change things about it, and then reconstruct it.\n\n38:15.360 --> 38:17.760\n And I mean, as soon as I hear this, I'm like,\n\n38:17.760 --> 38:20.440\n well, why don't you just change the compiler, right?\n\n38:20.440 --> 38:22.340\n Why not the first place you build the bytecode,\n\n38:22.340 --> 38:23.680\n just do it in the compiler.\n\n38:25.560 --> 38:28.040\n So yeah, I asked them how much they wanted it.\n\n38:29.160 --> 38:32.220\n Of course, measured in dollars and I'm like, well, okay.\n\n38:33.040 --> 38:34.600\n And yeah.\n\n38:34.600 --> 38:35.920\n And you wrote the compiler.\n\n38:35.920 --> 38:39.040\n Yeah, I modified, I wrote a 300 line diff to the compiler.\n\n38:39.040 --> 38:40.840\n It's open source, you can look at it.\n\n38:40.840 --> 38:43.000\n Yeah, it's, yeah, I looked at the code last night.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:46.680\n It's, yeah, exactly.\n\n38:46.680 --> 38:49.440\n Cute is a good word for it.\n\n38:49.440 --> 38:52.000\n And it's C++.\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:52.840\n C++, yeah.\n\n38:54.320 --> 38:57.040\n So when asked how you were able to do it,\n\n38:57.040 --> 39:01.820\n you said, you just gotta think and then do it right.\n\n39:03.080 --> 39:04.680\n So can you break that apart a little bit?\n\n39:04.680 --> 39:09.680\n What's your process of one, thinking and two, doing it right?\n\n39:09.920 --> 39:12.440\n You know, the people that I was working for\n\n39:12.440 --> 39:13.480\n were amused that I said that.\n\n39:13.480 --> 39:14.800\n It doesn't really mean anything.\n\n39:14.800 --> 39:15.640\n Okay.\n\n39:16.480 --> 39:19.640\n I mean, is there some deep, profound insights\n\n39:19.640 --> 39:23.600\n to draw from like how you problem solve from that?\n\n39:23.600 --> 39:24.640\n This is always what I say.\n\n39:24.640 --> 39:26.060\n I'm like, do you wanna be a good programmer?\n\n39:26.060 --> 39:27.840\n Do it for 20 years.\n\n39:27.840 --> 39:29.600\n Yeah, there's no shortcuts.\n\n39:29.600 --> 39:30.440\n No.\n\n39:31.360 --> 39:33.440\n What are your thoughts on crypto in general?\n\n39:33.440 --> 39:38.080\n So what parts technically or philosophically\n\n39:38.080 --> 39:40.040\n do you find especially beautiful maybe?\n\n39:40.040 --> 39:42.800\n Oh, I'm extremely bullish on crypto longterm.\n\n39:42.800 --> 39:47.340\n Not any specific crypto project, but this idea of,\n\n39:48.680 --> 39:50.320\n well, two ideas.\n\n39:50.320 --> 39:54.240\n One, the Nakamoto Consensus Algorithm\n\n39:54.240 --> 39:57.320\n is I think one of the greatest innovations\n\n39:57.320 --> 39:58.600\n of the 21st century.\n\n39:58.600 --> 40:01.260\n This idea that people can reach consensus.\n\n40:01.260 --> 40:03.400\n You can reach a group consensus.\n\n40:03.400 --> 40:08.220\n Using a relatively straightforward algorithm is wild.\n\n40:08.220 --> 40:13.220\n And like, you know, Satoshi Nakamoto,\n\n40:14.120 --> 40:15.580\n people always ask me who I look up to.\n\n40:15.580 --> 40:17.800\n It's like, whoever that is.\n\n40:17.800 --> 40:19.120\n Who do you think it is?\n\n40:19.120 --> 40:21.020\n I mean, Elon Musk?\n\n40:21.020 --> 40:22.320\n Is it you?\n\n40:22.320 --> 40:24.040\n It is definitely not me.\n\n40:24.040 --> 40:26.060\n And I do not think it's Elon Musk.\n\n40:26.060 --> 40:31.060\n But yeah, this idea of groups reaching consensus\n\n40:31.060 --> 40:34.940\n in a decentralized yet formulaic way\n\n40:34.940 --> 40:37.680\n is one extremely powerful idea from crypto.\n\n40:40.540 --> 40:45.540\n Maybe the second idea is this idea of smart contracts.\n\n40:45.860 --> 40:49.100\n When you write a contract between two parties,\n\n40:49.100 --> 40:53.720\n any contract, this contract, if there are disputes,\n\n40:53.720 --> 40:56.140\n it's interpreted by lawyers.\n\n40:56.140 --> 41:00.020\n Lawyers are just really shitty overpaid interpreters.\n\n41:00.020 --> 41:02.060\n Imagine you had, let's talk about them in terms of a,\n\n41:02.060 --> 41:05.260\n in terms of like, let's compare a lawyer to Python, right?\n\n41:05.260 --> 41:07.140\n So lawyer, well, okay.\n\n41:07.140 --> 41:10.020\n That's really, I never thought of it that way.\n\n41:10.020 --> 41:11.620\n It's hilarious.\n\n41:11.620 --> 41:15.900\n So Python, I'm paying even 10 cents an hour.\n\n41:15.900 --> 41:17.180\n I'll use the nice Azure machine.\n\n41:17.180 --> 41:19.660\n I can run Python for 10 cents an hour.\n\n41:19.660 --> 41:21.480\n Lawyers cost $1,000 an hour.\n\n41:21.480 --> 41:25.900\n So Python is 10,000 X better on that axis.\n\n41:25.900 --> 41:29.540\n Lawyers don't always return the same answer.\n\n41:31.100 --> 41:32.460\n Python almost always does.\n\n41:36.700 --> 41:37.740\n Cost.\n\n41:37.740 --> 41:40.940\n Yeah, I mean, just cost, reliability,\n\n41:40.940 --> 41:43.860\n everything about Python is so much better than lawyers.\n\n41:43.860 --> 41:46.100\n So if you can make smart contracts,\n\n41:46.100 --> 41:49.080\n this whole concept of code is law.\n\n41:50.400 --> 41:53.180\n I love, and I would love to live in a world\n\n41:53.180 --> 41:55.620\n where everybody accepted that fact.\n\n41:55.620 --> 42:00.620\n So maybe you can talk about what smart contracts are.\n\n42:01.180 --> 42:05.020\n So let's say, let's say, you know,\n\n42:05.020 --> 42:08.700\n we have a, even something as simple\n\n42:08.700 --> 42:11.700\n as a safety deposit box, right?\n\n42:11.700 --> 42:14.780\n Safety deposit box that holds a million dollars.\n\n42:14.780 --> 42:17.040\n I have a contract with the bank that says\n\n42:17.040 --> 42:22.040\n two out of these three parties must be present\n\n42:22.620 --> 42:25.280\n to open the safety deposit box and get the money out.\n\n42:25.280 --> 42:26.300\n So that's a contract for the bank,\n\n42:26.300 --> 42:29.020\n and it's only as good as the bank and the lawyers, right?\n\n42:29.020 --> 42:32.820\n Let's say, you know, somebody dies and now,\n\n42:32.820 --> 42:34.580\n oh, we're gonna go through a big legal dispute\n\n42:34.580 --> 42:36.140\n about whether, oh, well, was it in the will,\n\n42:36.140 --> 42:37.540\n was it not in the will?\n\n42:37.540 --> 42:39.780\n What, like, it's just so messy,\n\n42:39.780 --> 42:44.620\n and the cost to determine truth is so expensive.\n\n42:44.620 --> 42:47.220\n Versus a smart contract, which just uses cryptography\n\n42:47.220 --> 42:50.100\n to check if two out of three keys are present.\n\n42:50.100 --> 42:53.860\n Well, I can look at that, and I can have certainty\n\n42:53.860 --> 42:55.980\n in the answer that it's going to return.\n\n42:55.980 --> 42:58.220\n And that's what, all businesses want is certainty.\n\n42:58.220 --> 42:59.620\n You know, they say businesses don't care.\n\n42:59.620 --> 43:02.020\n Viacom, YouTube, YouTube's like,\n\n43:02.020 --> 43:04.100\n look, we don't care which way this lawsuit goes.\n\n43:04.100 --> 43:07.220\n Just please tell us so we can have certainty.\n\n43:07.220 --> 43:09.100\n Yeah, I wonder how many agreements in this,\n\n43:09.100 --> 43:12.720\n because we're talking about financial transactions only\n\n43:12.720 --> 43:15.620\n in this case, correct, the smart contracts?\n\n43:15.620 --> 43:17.380\n Oh, you can go to anything.\n\n43:17.380 --> 43:19.820\n You can put a prenup in the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n43:21.820 --> 43:23.020\n A married smart contract?\n\n43:23.020 --> 43:24.900\n Sorry, divorce lawyer, sorry.\n\n43:24.900 --> 43:26.820\n You're going to be replaced by Python.\n\n43:29.580 --> 43:34.580\n Okay, so that's another beautiful idea.\n\n43:34.980 --> 43:37.700\n Do you think there's something that's appealing to you\n\n43:37.700 --> 43:40.260\n about any one specific implementation?\n\n43:40.260 --> 43:45.100\n So if you look 10, 20, 50 years down the line,\n\n43:45.100 --> 43:48.140\n do you see any, like, Bitcoin, Ethereum,\n\n43:48.140 --> 43:51.140\n any of the other hundreds of cryptocurrencies winning out?\n\n43:51.140 --> 43:53.340\n Is there, like, what's your intuition about the space?\n\n43:53.340 --> 43:55.380\n Or are you just sitting back and watching the chaos\n\n43:55.380 --> 43:57.380\n and look who cares what emerges?\n\n43:57.380 --> 43:58.220\n Oh, I don't.\n\n43:58.220 --> 43:59.060\n I don't speculate.\n\n43:59.060 --> 43:59.900\n I don't really care.\n\n43:59.900 --> 44:02.620\n I don't really care which one of these projects wins.\n\n44:02.620 --> 44:05.500\n I'm kind of in the Bitcoin as a meme coin camp.\n\n44:05.500 --> 44:07.000\n I mean, why does Bitcoin have value?\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:10.040\n It's technically kind of, you know,\n\n44:11.740 --> 44:14.380\n not great, like the block size debate.\n\n44:14.380 --> 44:16.140\n When I found out what the block size debate was,\n\n44:16.140 --> 44:18.020\n I'm like, are you guys kidding?\n\n44:18.020 --> 44:21.180\n What's the block size debate?\n\n44:21.180 --> 44:22.020\n You know what?\n\n44:22.020 --> 44:23.820\n It's really, it's too stupid to even talk.\n\n44:23.820 --> 44:27.140\n People can look it up, but I'm like, wow.\n\n44:27.140 --> 44:28.420\n You know, Ethereum seems,\n\n44:28.420 --> 44:31.300\n the governance of Ethereum seems much better.\n\n44:31.300 --> 44:34.460\n I've come around a bit on proof of stake ideas.\n\n44:35.360 --> 44:37.740\n You know, very smart people thinking about some things.\n\n44:37.740 --> 44:40.340\n Yeah, you know, governance is interesting.\n\n44:40.340 --> 44:44.100\n It does feel like Vitalik,\n\n44:44.100 --> 44:46.100\n like it does feel like an open,\n\n44:46.100 --> 44:48.020\n even in these distributed systems,\n\n44:48.020 --> 44:50.100\n leaders are helpful\n\n44:51.220 --> 44:54.580\n because they kind of help you drive the mission\n\n44:54.580 --> 44:58.420\n and the vision and they put a face to a project.\n\n44:58.420 --> 45:00.140\n It's a weird thing about us humans.\n\n45:00.140 --> 45:02.820\n Geniuses are helpful, like Vitalik.\n\n45:02.820 --> 45:03.900\n Yeah, brilliant.\n\n45:06.540 --> 45:10.320\n Leaders are not necessarily, yeah.\n\n45:10.320 --> 45:15.340\n So you think the reason he's the face of Ethereum\n\n45:15.340 --> 45:17.100\n is because he's a genius.\n\n45:17.100 --> 45:18.060\n That's interesting.\n\n45:18.060 --> 45:19.640\n I mean, that was,\n\n45:21.460 --> 45:22.940\n it's interesting to think about\n\n45:22.940 --> 45:24.860\n that we need to create systems\n\n45:25.860 --> 45:30.340\n in which the quote unquote leaders that emerge\n\n45:30.340 --> 45:32.040\n are the geniuses in the system.\n\n45:33.060 --> 45:35.000\n I mean, that's arguably why\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:36.980\n the current state of democracy is broken\n\n45:36.980 --> 45:39.420\n is the people who are emerging as the leaders\n\n45:39.420 --> 45:40.980\n are not the most competent,\n\n45:40.980 --> 45:43.340\n are not the superstars of the system.\n\n45:43.340 --> 45:45.020\n And it seems like at least for now\n\n45:45.020 --> 45:47.220\n in the crypto world oftentimes\n\n45:47.220 --> 45:49.380\n the leaders are the superstars.\n\n45:49.380 --> 45:51.720\n Imagine at the debate they asked,\n\n45:51.720 --> 45:53.640\n what's the sixth amendment?\n\n45:53.640 --> 45:56.300\n What are the four fundamental forces in the universe?\n\n45:56.300 --> 45:58.100\n What's the integral of two to the X?\n\n45:59.940 --> 46:01.740\n I'd love to see those questions asked\n\n46:01.740 --> 46:03.380\n and that's what I want as our leader.\n\n46:03.380 --> 46:04.220\n It's a little bit.\n\n46:04.220 --> 46:05.140\n What's Bayes rule?\n\n46:07.160 --> 46:10.900\n Yeah, I mean, even, oh wow, you're hurting my brain.\n\n46:10.900 --> 46:15.020\n It's that my standard was even lower\n\n46:15.020 --> 46:17.660\n but I would have loved to see\n\n46:17.660 --> 46:20.600\n just this basic brilliance.\n\n46:20.600 --> 46:22.180\n Like I've talked to historians.\n\n46:22.180 --> 46:23.900\n There's just these, they're not even like\n\n46:23.900 --> 46:26.720\n they don't have a PhD or even education history.\n\n46:26.720 --> 46:30.040\n They just like a Dan Carlin type character\n\n46:30.040 --> 46:32.780\n who just like, holy shit.\n\n46:32.780 --> 46:35.420\n How did all this information get into your head?\n\n46:35.420 --> 46:38.460\n They're able to just connect Genghis Khan\n\n46:38.460 --> 46:41.820\n to the entirety of the history of the 20th century.\n\n46:41.820 --> 46:46.180\n They know everything about every single battle that happened\n\n46:46.180 --> 46:51.020\n and they know the game of Thrones\n\n46:51.020 --> 46:55.100\n of the different power plays and all that happened there.\n\n46:55.100 --> 46:56.700\n And they know like the individuals\n\n46:56.700 --> 46:58.580\n and all the documents involved\n\n46:58.580 --> 47:02.060\n and they integrate that into their regular life.\n\n47:02.060 --> 47:03.980\n It's not like they're ultra history nerds.\n\n47:03.980 --> 47:06.380\n They're just, they know this information.\n\n47:06.380 --> 47:08.020\n That's what competence looks like.\n\n47:08.020 --> 47:09.060\n Yeah.\n\n47:09.060 --> 47:10.660\n Cause I've seen that with programmers too, right?\n\n47:10.660 --> 47:12.580\n That's what great programmers do.\n\n47:12.580 --> 47:15.780\n But yeah, it would be, it's really unfortunate\n\n47:15.780 --> 47:19.340\n that those kinds of people aren't emerging as our leaders.\n\n47:19.340 --> 47:21.820\n But for now, at least in the crypto world\n\n47:21.820 --> 47:23.260\n that seems to be the case.\n\n47:23.260 --> 47:26.700\n I don't know if that always, you could imagine\n\n47:26.700 --> 47:28.820\n that in a hundred years, it's not the case, right?\n\n47:28.820 --> 47:31.940\n Crypto world has one very powerful idea going for it\n\n47:31.940 --> 47:35.020\n and that's the idea of forks, right?\n\n47:35.020 --> 47:40.020\n I mean, imagine, we'll use a less controversial example.\n\n47:42.940 --> 47:47.140\n This was actually in my joke app in 2012.\n\n47:47.140 --> 47:49.460\n I was like, Barack Obama, Mitt Romney,\n\n47:49.460 --> 47:51.060\n let's let them both be president, right?\n\n47:51.060 --> 47:52.940\n Like imagine we could fork America\n\n47:52.940 --> 47:54.500\n and just let them both be president.\n\n47:54.500 --> 47:56.060\n And then the Americas could compete\n\n47:56.060 --> 47:58.180\n and people could invest in one,\n\n47:58.180 --> 48:00.500\n pull their liquidity out of one, put it in the other.\n\n48:00.500 --> 48:02.420\n You have this in the crypto world.\n\n48:02.420 --> 48:05.540\n Ethereum forks into Ethereum and Ethereum classic.\n\n48:05.540 --> 48:07.340\n And you can pull your liquidity out of one\n\n48:07.340 --> 48:08.980\n and put it in another.\n\n48:08.980 --> 48:10.740\n And people vote with their dollars,\n\n48:11.980 --> 48:16.420\n which forks, companies should be able to fork.\n\n48:16.420 --> 48:18.180\n I'd love to fork Nvidia, you know?\n\n48:20.260 --> 48:22.780\n Yeah, like different business strategies\n\n48:22.780 --> 48:26.180\n and then try them out and see what works.\n\n48:26.180 --> 48:34.780\n Like even take, yeah, take comma AI that closes its source\n\n48:34.780 --> 48:38.300\n and then take one that's open source and see what works.\n\n48:38.300 --> 48:41.060\n Take one that's purchased by GM\n\n48:41.060 --> 48:43.540\n and one that remains Android Renegade\n\n48:43.540 --> 48:45.300\n and all these different versions and see.\n\n48:45.300 --> 48:47.900\n The beauty of comma AI is someone can actually do that.\n\n48:47.900 --> 48:49.660\n Please take comma AI and fork it.\n\n48:50.620 --> 48:53.020\n That's right, that's the beauty of open source.\n\n48:53.020 --> 48:56.420\n So you're, I mean, we'll talk about autonomous vehicle space,\n\n48:56.420 --> 49:02.100\n but it does seem that you're really knowledgeable\n\n49:02.100 --> 49:03.940\n about a lot of different topics.\n\n49:03.940 --> 49:06.100\n So the natural question a bunch of people ask this,\n\n49:06.100 --> 49:09.980\n which is how do you keep learning new things?\n\n49:09.980 --> 49:12.420\n Do you have like practical advice\n\n49:12.420 --> 49:15.820\n if you were to introspect, like taking notes,\n\n49:15.820 --> 49:19.220\n allocate time, or do you just mess around\n\n49:19.220 --> 49:21.340\n and just allow your curiosity to drive?\n\n49:21.340 --> 49:23.060\n I'll write these people a self help book\n\n49:23.060 --> 49:25.060\n and I'll charge $67 for it.\n\n49:25.060 --> 49:28.500\n And I will write, I will write,\n\n49:28.500 --> 49:30.300\n I will write on the cover of the self help book.\n\n49:30.300 --> 49:32.500\n All of this advice is completely meaningless.\n\n49:32.500 --> 49:34.740\n You're gonna be a sucker and buy this book anyway.\n\n49:34.740 --> 49:38.860\n And the one lesson that I hope they take away from the book\n\n49:38.860 --> 49:42.580\n is that I can't give you a meaningful answer to that.\n\n49:42.580 --> 49:44.020\n That's interesting.\n\n49:44.020 --> 49:45.420\n Let me translate that.\n\n49:45.420 --> 49:50.340\n Is you haven't really thought about what it is you do\n\n49:51.580 --> 49:53.900\n systematically because you could reduce it.\n\n49:53.900 --> 49:56.980\n And there's some people, I mean, I've met brilliant people\n\n49:56.980 --> 50:00.180\n that this is really clear with athletes.\n\n50:00.180 --> 50:03.580\n Some are just, you know, the best in the world\n\n50:03.580 --> 50:06.820\n at something and they have zero interest\n\n50:06.820 --> 50:09.500\n in writing like a self help book,\n\n50:09.500 --> 50:11.620\n or how to master this game.\n\n50:11.620 --> 50:15.620\n And then there's some athletes who become great coaches\n\n50:15.620 --> 50:18.820\n and they love the analysis, perhaps the over analysis.\n\n50:18.820 --> 50:20.740\n And you right now, at least at your age,\n\n50:20.740 --> 50:23.180\n which is an interesting, you're in the middle of the battle.\n\n50:23.180 --> 50:25.620\n You're like the warriors that have zero interest\n\n50:25.620 --> 50:26.660\n in writing books.\n\n50:27.820 --> 50:29.140\n So you're in the middle of the battle.\n\n50:29.140 --> 50:30.580\n So you have, yeah.\n\n50:30.580 --> 50:31.740\n This is a fair point.\n\n50:31.740 --> 50:34.060\n I do think I have a certain aversion\n\n50:34.060 --> 50:39.060\n to this kind of deliberate intentional way of living life.\n\n50:39.060 --> 50:41.820\n You're eventually, the hilarity of this,\n\n50:41.820 --> 50:43.620\n especially since this is recorded,\n\n50:43.620 --> 50:47.620\n it will reveal beautifully the absurdity\n\n50:47.620 --> 50:49.620\n when you finally do publish this book.\n\n50:49.620 --> 50:51.540\n I guarantee you, you will.\n\n50:51.540 --> 50:56.060\n The story of comma AI, maybe it'll be a biography\n\n50:56.060 --> 50:57.060\n written about you.\n\n50:57.060 --> 50:58.740\n That'll be better, I guess.\n\n50:58.740 --> 51:00.740\n And you might be able to learn some cute lessons\n\n51:00.740 --> 51:03.700\n if you're starting a company like comma AI from that book.\n\n51:03.700 --> 51:05.660\n But if you're asking generic questions,\n\n51:05.660 --> 51:07.740\n like how do I be good at things?\n\n51:07.740 --> 51:10.260\n How do I be good at things?\n\n51:10.260 --> 51:11.900\n Dude, I don't know.\n\n51:11.900 --> 51:14.380\n Do them a lot.\n\n51:14.380 --> 51:15.220\n Do them a lot.\n\n51:15.220 --> 51:18.580\n But the interesting thing here is learning things\n\n51:18.580 --> 51:22.020\n outside of your current trajectory,\n\n51:22.020 --> 51:24.660\n which is what it feels like from an outsider's perspective.\n\n51:28.140 --> 51:30.900\n I don't know if there's advice on that,\n\n51:30.900 --> 51:33.340\n but it is an interesting curiosity.\n\n51:33.340 --> 51:38.020\n When you become really busy, you're running a company.\n\n51:38.020 --> 51:38.860\n Hard time.\n\n51:40.340 --> 51:41.580\n Yeah.\n\n51:41.580 --> 51:46.100\n But there's a natural inclination and trend.\n\n51:46.100 --> 51:48.980\n Just the momentum of life carries you\n\n51:48.980 --> 51:51.060\n into a particular direction of wanting to focus.\n\n51:51.060 --> 51:55.140\n And this kind of dispersion that curiosity can lead to\n\n51:55.140 --> 51:58.220\n gets harder and harder with time.\n\n51:58.220 --> 52:00.940\n Because you get really good at certain things\n\n52:00.940 --> 52:03.820\n and it sucks trying things that you're not good at,\n\n52:03.820 --> 52:05.340\n like trying to figure them out.\n\n52:05.340 --> 52:07.380\n When you do this with your live streams,\n\n52:07.380 --> 52:10.060\n you're on the fly figuring stuff out.\n\n52:10.060 --> 52:11.780\n You don't mind looking dumb.\n\n52:11.780 --> 52:12.620\n No.\n\n52:14.140 --> 52:16.660\n You just figure it out pretty quickly.\n\n52:16.660 --> 52:19.180\n Sometimes I try things and I don't figure them out quickly.\n\n52:19.180 --> 52:20.980\n My chest rating is like a 1400,\n\n52:20.980 --> 52:23.300\n despite putting like a couple of hundred hours in.\n\n52:23.300 --> 52:24.340\n It's pathetic.\n\n52:24.340 --> 52:26.860\n I mean, to be fair, I know that I could do it better\n\n52:26.860 --> 52:27.700\n if I did it better.\n\n52:27.700 --> 52:29.860\n Like don't play five minute games,\n\n52:29.860 --> 52:31.380\n play 15 minute games at least.\n\n52:31.380 --> 52:34.260\n Like I know these things, but it just doesn't,\n\n52:34.260 --> 52:37.260\n it doesn't stick nicely in my knowledge stream.\n\n52:37.260 --> 52:39.300\n All right, let's talk about Comma AI.\n\n52:39.300 --> 52:42.140\n What's the mission of the company?\n\n52:42.140 --> 52:44.860\n Let's like look at the biggest picture.\n\n52:44.860 --> 52:46.820\n Oh, I have an exact statement.\n\n52:46.820 --> 52:48.660\n Solve self driving cars\n\n52:48.660 --> 52:51.540\n while delivering shippable intermediaries.\n\n52:51.540 --> 52:56.300\n So longterm vision is have fully autonomous vehicles\n\n52:56.300 --> 52:59.060\n and make sure you're making money along the way.\n\n52:59.060 --> 53:00.220\n I think it doesn't really speak to money,\n\n53:00.220 --> 53:03.260\n but I can talk about what solve self driving cars means.\n\n53:03.260 --> 53:05.260\n Solve self driving cars of course means\n\n53:06.700 --> 53:08.020\n you're not building a new car,\n\n53:08.020 --> 53:10.460\n you're building a person replacement.\n\n53:10.460 --> 53:12.340\n That person can sit in the driver's seat\n\n53:12.340 --> 53:14.580\n and drive you anywhere a person can drive\n\n53:14.580 --> 53:17.980\n with a human or better level of safety,\n\n53:17.980 --> 53:19.500\n speed, quality, comfort.\n\n53:21.420 --> 53:23.260\n And what's the second part of that?\n\n53:23.260 --> 53:26.620\n Delivering shippable intermediaries is well,\n\n53:26.620 --> 53:28.180\n it's a way to fund the company, that's true.\n\n53:28.180 --> 53:30.140\n But it's also a way to keep us honest.\n\n53:31.980 --> 53:34.900\n If you don't have that, it is very easy\n\n53:34.900 --> 53:39.020\n with this technology to think you're making progress\n\n53:39.020 --> 53:40.180\n when you're not.\n\n53:40.180 --> 53:42.380\n I've heard it best described on Hacker News as\n\n53:43.420 --> 53:46.660\n you can set any arbitrary milestone,\n\n53:46.660 --> 53:49.500\n meet that milestone and still be infinitely far away\n\n53:49.500 --> 53:51.740\n from solving self driving cars.\n\n53:51.740 --> 53:53.820\n So it's hard to have like real deadlines\n\n53:53.820 --> 53:58.820\n when you're like Cruz or Waymo when you don't have revenue.\n\n54:02.100 --> 54:04.500\n Is that, I mean, is revenue essentially\n\n54:06.060 --> 54:07.820\n the thing we're talking about here?\n\n54:07.820 --> 54:11.460\n Revenue is, capitalism is based around consent.\n\n54:11.460 --> 54:13.100\n Capitalism, the way that you get revenue\n\n54:13.100 --> 54:16.340\n is real capitalism comes in the real capitalism camp.\n\n54:16.340 --> 54:17.340\n There's definitely scams out there,\n\n54:17.340 --> 54:19.580\n but real capitalism is based around consent.\n\n54:19.580 --> 54:20.740\n It's based around this idea that like,\n\n54:20.740 --> 54:22.980\n if we're getting revenue, it's because we're providing\n\n54:22.980 --> 54:24.780\n at least that much value to another person.\n\n54:24.780 --> 54:27.460\n When someone buys $1,000 comma two from us,\n\n54:27.460 --> 54:29.100\n we're providing them at least $1,000 of value\n\n54:29.100 --> 54:30.180\n or they wouldn't buy it.\n\n54:30.180 --> 54:32.940\n Brilliant, so can you give a whirlwind overview\n\n54:32.940 --> 54:34.940\n of the products that Comma AI provides,\n\n54:34.940 --> 54:38.180\n like throughout its history and today?\n\n54:38.180 --> 54:40.780\n I mean, yeah, the past ones aren't really that interesting.\n\n54:40.780 --> 54:43.860\n It's kind of just been refinement of the same idea.\n\n54:45.180 --> 54:48.300\n The real only product we sell today is the Comma 2.\n\n54:48.300 --> 54:50.500\n Which is a piece of hardware with cameras.\n\n54:50.500 --> 54:54.700\n Mm, so the Comma 2, I mean, you can think about it\n\n54:54.700 --> 54:55.780\n kind of like a person.\n\n54:57.100 --> 54:58.340\n Future hardware will probably be\n\n54:58.340 --> 55:00.300\n even more and more personlike.\n\n55:00.300 --> 55:05.300\n So it has eyes, ears, a mouth, a brain,\n\n55:07.460 --> 55:09.540\n and a way to interface with the car.\n\n55:09.540 --> 55:10.980\n Does it have consciousness?\n\n55:10.980 --> 55:13.500\n Just kidding, that was a trick question.\n\n55:13.500 --> 55:15.140\n I don't have consciousness either.\n\n55:15.140 --> 55:16.420\n Me and the Comma 2 are the same.\n\n55:16.420 --> 55:17.260\n You're the same?\n\n55:17.260 --> 55:18.660\n I have a little more compute than it.\n\n55:18.660 --> 55:23.260\n It only has like the same compute as a B, you know.\n\n55:23.260 --> 55:25.300\n You're more efficient energy wise\n\n55:25.300 --> 55:26.460\n for the compute you're doing.\n\n55:26.460 --> 55:28.100\n Far more efficient energy wise.\n\n55:29.020 --> 55:30.580\n 20 petaflops, 20 watts, crazy.\n\n55:30.580 --> 55:32.220\n Do you lack consciousness?\n\n55:32.220 --> 55:33.060\n Sure.\n\n55:33.060 --> 55:33.900\n Do you fear death?\n\n55:33.900 --> 55:35.500\n You do, you want immortality.\n\n55:35.500 --> 55:36.340\n Of course I fear death.\n\n55:36.340 --> 55:38.100\n Does Comma AI fear death?\n\n55:38.100 --> 55:39.580\n I don't think so.\n\n55:39.580 --> 55:40.500\n Of course it does.\n\n55:40.500 --> 55:42.980\n It very much fears, well, it fears negative loss.\n\n55:42.980 --> 55:43.820\n Oh yeah.\n\n55:43.820 --> 55:48.820\n Okay, so Comma 2, when did that come out?\n\n55:49.220 --> 55:50.500\n That was a year ago?\n\n55:50.500 --> 55:52.100\n No, two.\n\n55:52.100 --> 55:53.540\n Early this year.\n\n55:53.540 --> 55:56.900\n Wow, time, it feels like, yeah.\n\n55:56.900 --> 56:00.820\n 2020 feels like it's taken 10 years to get to the end.\n\n56:00.820 --> 56:01.820\n It's a long year.\n\n56:01.820 --> 56:03.140\n It's a long year.\n\n56:03.140 --> 56:08.140\n So what's the sexiest thing about Comma 2 feature wise?\n\n56:08.140 --> 56:13.140\n So, I mean, maybe you can also link on like, what is it?\n\n56:14.340 --> 56:15.740\n Like what's its purpose?\n\n56:15.740 --> 56:18.540\n Cause there's a hardware, there's a software component.\n\n56:18.540 --> 56:20.020\n You've mentioned the sensors,\n\n56:20.020 --> 56:23.060\n but also like what is it, its features and capabilities?\n\n56:23.060 --> 56:25.340\n I think our slogan summarizes it well.\n\n56:25.340 --> 56:27.220\n Comma slogan is make driving chill.\n\n56:28.860 --> 56:30.660\n I love it, okay.\n\n56:30.660 --> 56:33.020\n Yeah, I mean, it is, you know,\n\n56:33.020 --> 56:35.340\n if you like cruise control, imagine cruise control,\n\n56:35.340 --> 56:36.660\n but much, much more.\n\n56:36.660 --> 56:41.020\n So it can do adaptive cruise control things,\n\n56:41.020 --> 56:42.980\n which is like slow down for cars in front of it,\n\n56:42.980 --> 56:44.220\n maintain a certain speed.\n\n56:44.220 --> 56:46.260\n And it can also do lane keeping.\n\n56:46.260 --> 56:48.700\n So staying in the lane and doing it better\n\n56:48.700 --> 56:50.020\n and better and better over time.\n\n56:50.020 --> 56:52.060\n It's very much machine learning based.\n\n56:53.060 --> 56:56.660\n So this camera is, there's a driver facing camera too.\n\n57:01.100 --> 57:02.100\n What else is there?\n\n57:02.100 --> 57:02.940\n What am I thinking?\n\n57:02.940 --> 57:04.380\n So the hardware versus software.\n\n57:04.380 --> 57:09.020\n So open pilot versus the actual hardware of the device.\n\n57:09.020 --> 57:10.580\n What's, can you draw that distinction?\n\n57:10.580 --> 57:11.580\n What's one, what's the other?\n\n57:11.580 --> 57:13.820\n I mean, the hardware is pretty much a cell phone\n\n57:13.820 --> 57:14.700\n with a few additions.\n\n57:14.700 --> 57:16.940\n A cell phone with a cooling system\n\n57:16.940 --> 57:20.980\n and with a car interface connected to it.\n\n57:20.980 --> 57:24.460\n And by cell phone, you mean like Qualcomm Snapdragon.\n\n57:25.620 --> 57:27.980\n Yeah, the current hardware is a Snapdragon 821.\n\n57:29.380 --> 57:32.180\n It has wifi radio, it has an LTE radio, it has a screen.\n\n57:32.180 --> 57:35.980\n We use every part of the cell phone.\n\n57:35.980 --> 57:37.540\n And then the interface with the car\n\n57:37.540 --> 57:38.460\n is specific to the car.\n\n57:38.460 --> 57:40.580\n So you keep supporting more and more cars.\n\n57:41.460 --> 57:42.660\n Yeah, so the interface to the car,\n\n57:42.660 --> 57:45.340\n I mean, the device itself just has four CAN buses.\n\n57:45.340 --> 57:46.860\n It has four CAN interfaces on it\n\n57:46.860 --> 57:49.420\n that are connected through the USB port to the phone.\n\n57:49.420 --> 57:53.300\n And then, yeah, on those four CAN buses,\n\n57:53.300 --> 57:54.460\n you connect it to the car.\n\n57:54.460 --> 57:56.460\n And there's a little harness to do this.\n\n57:56.460 --> 57:58.460\n Cars are actually surprisingly similar.\n\n57:58.460 --> 58:01.500\n So CAN is the protocol by which cars communicate.\n\n58:01.500 --> 58:04.260\n And then you're able to read stuff and write stuff\n\n58:04.260 --> 58:06.900\n to be able to control the car depending on the car.\n\n58:06.900 --> 58:08.260\n So what's the software side?\n\n58:08.260 --> 58:09.300\n What's OpenPilot?\n\n58:10.380 --> 58:11.740\n So I mean, OpenPilot is,\n\n58:11.740 --> 58:13.740\n the hardware is pretty simple compared to OpenPilot.\n\n58:13.740 --> 58:18.740\n OpenPilot is, well, so you have a machine learning model,\n\n58:21.020 --> 58:24.540\n which it's in OpenPilot, it's a blob.\n\n58:24.540 --> 58:25.620\n It's just a blob of weights.\n\n58:25.620 --> 58:27.420\n It's not like people are like, oh, it's closed source.\n\n58:27.420 --> 58:28.860\n I'm like, it's a blob of weights.\n\n58:28.860 --> 58:29.780\n What do you expect?\n\n58:29.780 --> 58:33.380\n So it's primarily neural network based.\n\n58:33.380 --> 58:36.020\n You, well, OpenPilot is all the software\n\n58:36.020 --> 58:37.660\n kind of around that neural network.\n\n58:37.660 --> 58:39.060\n That if you have a neural network that says,\n\n58:39.060 --> 58:40.860\n here's where you wanna send the car,\n\n58:40.860 --> 58:43.600\n OpenPilot actually goes and executes all of that.\n\n58:44.780 --> 58:46.900\n It cleans up the input to the neural network.\n\n58:46.900 --> 58:49.060\n It cleans up the output and executes on it.\n\n58:49.060 --> 58:50.860\n So it connects, it's the glue\n\n58:50.860 --> 58:51.860\n that connects everything together.\n\n58:51.860 --> 58:54.420\n Runs the sensors, does a bunch of calibration\n\n58:54.420 --> 58:58.100\n for the neural network, deals with like,\n\n58:58.100 --> 59:00.140\n if the car is on a banked road,\n\n59:00.140 --> 59:02.060\n you have to counter steer against that.\n\n59:02.060 --> 59:03.820\n And the neural network can't necessarily know that\n\n59:03.820 --> 59:05.120\n by looking at the picture.\n\n59:06.420 --> 59:08.100\n So you do that with other sensors\n\n59:08.100 --> 59:09.900\n and Fusion and Localizer.\n\n59:09.900 --> 59:11.780\n OpenPilot also is responsible\n\n59:11.780 --> 59:14.780\n for sending the data up to our servers.\n\n59:14.780 --> 59:17.940\n So we can learn from it, logging it, recording it,\n\n59:17.940 --> 59:21.500\n running the cameras, thermally managing the device,\n\n59:21.500 --> 59:23.180\n managing the disk space on the device,\n\n59:23.180 --> 59:24.780\n managing all the resources on the device.\n\n59:24.780 --> 59:26.860\n So what, since we last spoke,\n\n59:26.860 --> 59:28.460\n I don't remember when, maybe a year ago,\n\n59:28.460 --> 59:30.180\n maybe a little bit longer,\n\n59:30.180 --> 59:33.100\n how has OpenPilot improved?\n\n59:33.100 --> 59:34.860\n We did exactly what I promised you.\n\n59:34.860 --> 59:36.760\n I promised you that by the end of the year,\n\n59:36.760 --> 59:38.860\n where you'd be able to remove the lanes.\n\n59:40.500 --> 59:45.500\n The lateral policy is now almost completely end to end.\n\n59:46.060 --> 59:48.600\n You can turn the lanes off and it will drive,\n\n59:48.600 --> 59:49.980\n drive slightly worse on the highway\n\n59:49.980 --> 59:51.060\n if you turn the lanes off,\n\n59:51.060 --> 59:54.260\n but you can turn the lanes off and it will drive well,\n\n59:54.260 --> 59:57.220\n trained completely end to end on user data.\n\n59:57.220 --> 59:58.700\n And this year we hope to do the same\n\n59:58.700 --> 1:00:00.140\n for the longitudinal policy.\n\n1:00:00.140 --> 1:00:03.380\n So that's the interesting thing is you're not doing,\n\n1:00:03.380 --> 1:00:05.380\n you don't appear to be, maybe you can correct me,\n\n1:00:05.380 --> 1:00:08.700\n you don't appear to be doing lane detection\n\n1:00:08.700 --> 1:00:12.420\n or lane marking detection or kind of the segmentation task\n\n1:00:12.420 --> 1:00:15.100\n or any kind of object detection task.\n\n1:00:15.100 --> 1:00:17.580\n You're doing what's traditionally more called\n\n1:00:17.580 --> 1:00:19.420\n like end to end learning.\n\n1:00:19.420 --> 1:00:24.180\n So, and trained on actual behavior of drivers\n\n1:00:24.180 --> 1:00:26.100\n when they're driving the car manually.\n\n1:00:27.780 --> 1:00:29.820\n And this is hard to do.\n\n1:00:29.820 --> 1:00:31.340\n It's not supervised learning.\n\n1:00:32.220 --> 1:00:34.740\n Yeah, but so the nice thing is there's a lot of data.\n\n1:00:34.740 --> 1:00:37.060\n So it's hard and easy, right?\n\n1:00:37.060 --> 1:00:37.900\n It's a...\n\n1:00:37.900 --> 1:00:40.020\n We have a lot of high quality data, yeah.\n\n1:00:40.020 --> 1:00:41.700\n Like more than you need in the second.\n\n1:00:41.700 --> 1:00:42.700\n Well...\n\n1:00:42.700 --> 1:00:43.520\n We have way more than we do.\n\n1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:44.980\n We have way more data than we need.\n\n1:00:44.980 --> 1:00:47.040\n I mean, it's an interesting question actually,\n\n1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:50.440\n because in terms of amount, you have more than you need,\n\n1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:54.260\n but the driving is full of edge cases.\n\n1:00:54.260 --> 1:00:57.180\n So how do you select the data you train on?\n\n1:00:58.260 --> 1:01:00.540\n I think this is an interesting open question.\n\n1:01:00.540 --> 1:01:04.220\n Like what's the cleverest way to select data?\n\n1:01:04.220 --> 1:01:06.660\n That's the question Tesla is probably working on.\n\n1:01:07.660 --> 1:01:09.900\n That's, I mean, the entirety of machine learning can be,\n\n1:01:09.900 --> 1:01:11.060\n they don't seem to really care.\n\n1:01:11.060 --> 1:01:12.260\n They just kind of select data.\n\n1:01:12.260 --> 1:01:14.860\n But I feel like that if you want to solve,\n\n1:01:14.860 --> 1:01:16.220\n if you want to create intelligent systems,\n\n1:01:16.220 --> 1:01:18.900\n you have to pick data well, right?\n\n1:01:18.900 --> 1:01:22.900\n And so do you have any hints, ideas of how to do it well?\n\n1:01:22.900 --> 1:01:25.140\n So in some ways that is...\n\n1:01:25.140 --> 1:01:27.400\n The definition I like of reinforcement learning\n\n1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:29.300\n versus supervised learning.\n\n1:01:29.300 --> 1:01:32.720\n In supervised learning, the weights depend on the data.\n\n1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:33.560\n Right?\n\n1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:35.700\n And this is obviously true,\n\n1:01:35.700 --> 1:01:38.320\n but in reinforcement learning,\n\n1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:40.420\n the data depends on the weights.\n\n1:01:40.420 --> 1:01:41.380\n Yeah.\n\n1:01:41.380 --> 1:01:42.540\n And actually both ways.\n\n1:01:42.540 --> 1:01:43.980\n That's poetry.\n\n1:01:43.980 --> 1:01:46.260\n So how does it know what data to train on?\n\n1:01:46.260 --> 1:01:47.540\n Well, let it pick.\n\n1:01:47.540 --> 1:01:49.460\n We're not there yet, but that's the eventual.\n\n1:01:49.460 --> 1:01:51.100\n So you're thinking this almost like\n\n1:01:51.100 --> 1:01:53.320\n a reinforcement learning framework.\n\n1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:55.380\n We're going to do RL on the world.\n\n1:01:55.380 --> 1:01:58.140\n Every time a car makes a mistake, user disengages,\n\n1:01:58.140 --> 1:02:00.140\n we train on that and do RL on the world.\n\n1:02:00.140 --> 1:02:03.260\n Ship out a new model, that's an epoch, right?\n\n1:02:03.260 --> 1:02:08.260\n And for now you're not doing the Elon style promising\n\n1:02:08.540 --> 1:02:09.700\n that it's going to be fully autonomous.\n\n1:02:09.700 --> 1:02:12.420\n You really are sticking to level two\n\n1:02:12.420 --> 1:02:15.300\n and like it's supposed to be supervised.\n\n1:02:15.300 --> 1:02:16.900\n It is definitely supposed to be supervised\n\n1:02:16.900 --> 1:02:19.740\n and we enforce the fact that it's supervised.\n\n1:02:19.740 --> 1:02:23.660\n We look at our rate of improvement in disengagements.\n\n1:02:23.660 --> 1:02:25.700\n OpenPilot now has an unplanned disengagement\n\n1:02:25.700 --> 1:02:27.440\n about every a hundred miles.\n\n1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:31.620\n This is up from 10 miles, like maybe,\n\n1:02:32.580 --> 1:02:36.560\n maybe maybe a year ago.\n\n1:02:36.560 --> 1:02:37.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:37.400 --> 1:02:38.500\n So maybe we've seen 10 X improvement in a year,\n\n1:02:38.500 --> 1:02:41.740\n but a hundred miles is still a far cry\n\n1:02:41.740 --> 1:02:43.880\n from the a hundred thousand you're going to need.\n\n1:02:43.880 --> 1:02:48.060\n So you're going to somehow need to get three more 10 Xs\n\n1:02:48.060 --> 1:02:48.900\n in there.\n\n1:02:49.880 --> 1:02:52.300\n And you're, what's your intuition?\n\n1:02:52.300 --> 1:02:54.540\n You're basically hoping that there's exponential\n\n1:02:54.540 --> 1:02:56.940\n improvement built into the baked into the cake somewhere.\n\n1:02:56.940 --> 1:02:58.420\n Well, that's even, I mean, 10 X improvement,\n\n1:02:58.420 --> 1:03:00.540\n that's already assuming exponential, right?\n\n1:03:00.540 --> 1:03:02.620\n There's definitely exponential improvement.\n\n1:03:02.620 --> 1:03:04.340\n And I think when Elon talks about exponential,\n\n1:03:04.340 --> 1:03:06.340\n like these things, these systems are going to\n\n1:03:06.340 --> 1:03:09.820\n exponentially improve, just exponential doesn't mean\n\n1:03:09.820 --> 1:03:12.660\n you're getting a hundred gigahertz processors tomorrow.\n\n1:03:12.660 --> 1:03:15.060\n Right? Like it's going to still take a while\n\n1:03:15.060 --> 1:03:18.340\n because the gap between even our best system\n\n1:03:18.340 --> 1:03:20.300\n and humans is still large.\n\n1:03:20.300 --> 1:03:22.340\n So that's an interesting distinction to draw.\n\n1:03:22.340 --> 1:03:25.100\n So if you look at the way Tesla is approaching the problem\n\n1:03:26.100 --> 1:03:28.340\n and the way you're approaching the problem,\n\n1:03:28.340 --> 1:03:31.780\n which is very different than the rest of the self driving\n\n1:03:31.780 --> 1:03:32.720\n car world.\n\n1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:35.380\n So let's put them aside is you're treating most\n\n1:03:35.380 --> 1:03:37.500\n the driving task as a machine learning problem.\n\n1:03:37.500 --> 1:03:40.260\n And the way Tesla is approaching it is with the multitask\n\n1:03:40.260 --> 1:03:44.100\n learning where you break the task of driving into hundreds\n\n1:03:44.100 --> 1:03:47.180\n of different tasks and you have this multiheaded\n\n1:03:47.180 --> 1:03:51.660\n neural network that's very good at performing each task.\n\n1:03:51.660 --> 1:03:54.620\n And there there's presumably something on top that's\n\n1:03:54.620 --> 1:03:59.240\n stitching stuff together in order to make control\n\n1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:02.180\n decisions, policy decisions about how you move the car.\n\n1:04:02.180 --> 1:04:04.420\n But what that allows you, there's a brilliance to this\n\n1:04:04.420 --> 1:04:08.360\n because it allows you to master each task,\n\n1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:13.360\n like lane detection, stop sign detection,\n\n1:04:13.380 --> 1:04:17.620\n the traffic light detection, drivable area segmentation,\n\n1:04:19.180 --> 1:04:21.840\n you know, vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian detection.\n\n1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.420\n There's some localization tasks in there.\n\n1:04:25.420 --> 1:04:30.420\n Also predicting of like, yeah,\n\n1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:34.060\n predicting how the entities in the scene are going to move.\n\n1:04:34.060 --> 1:04:36.360\n Like everything is basically a machine learning task.\n\n1:04:36.360 --> 1:04:40.380\n So there's a classification, segmentation, prediction.\n\n1:04:40.380 --> 1:04:44.460\n And it's nice because you can have this entire engine,\n\n1:04:44.460 --> 1:04:48.740\n data engine that's mining for edge cases for each one of\n\n1:04:48.740 --> 1:04:49.580\n these tasks.\n\n1:04:49.580 --> 1:04:52.200\n And you can have people like engineers that are basically\n\n1:04:52.200 --> 1:04:53.820\n masters of that task,\n\n1:04:53.820 --> 1:04:56.600\n like become the best person in the world at,\n\n1:04:56.600 --> 1:04:59.860\n as you talk about the cone guy for Waymo,\n\n1:04:59.860 --> 1:05:06.700\n the becoming the best person in the world at cone detection.\n\n1:05:06.700 --> 1:05:10.140\n So that's a compelling notion from a supervised learning\n\n1:05:10.140 --> 1:05:15.380\n perspective, automating much of the process of edge case\n\n1:05:15.380 --> 1:05:17.820\n discovery and retraining neural network for each of the\n\n1:05:17.820 --> 1:05:19.780\n individual perception tasks.\n\n1:05:19.780 --> 1:05:22.460\n And then you're looking at the machine learning in a more\n\n1:05:22.460 --> 1:05:27.240\n holistic way, basically doing end to end learning on the\n\n1:05:27.240 --> 1:05:31.500\n driving tasks, supervised, trained on the data of the\n\n1:05:31.500 --> 1:05:34.420\n actual driving of people.\n\n1:05:34.420 --> 1:05:37.580\n They use comma AI, like actual human drivers,\n\n1:05:37.580 --> 1:05:38.700\n their manual control,\n\n1:05:38.700 --> 1:05:43.700\n plus the moments of disengagement that maybe with some\n\n1:05:44.400 --> 1:05:47.340\n labeling could indicate the failure of the system.\n\n1:05:47.340 --> 1:05:48.900\n So you have the,\n\n1:05:48.900 --> 1:05:52.420\n you have a huge amount of data for positive control of the\n\n1:05:52.420 --> 1:05:55.560\n vehicle, like successful control of the vehicle,\n\n1:05:55.560 --> 1:05:58.340\n both maintaining the lane as,\n\n1:05:58.340 --> 1:06:01.060\n as I think you're also working on longitudinal control of\n\n1:06:01.060 --> 1:06:04.700\n the vehicle and then failure cases where the vehicle does\n\n1:06:04.700 --> 1:06:08.380\n something wrong that needs disengagement.\n\n1:06:08.380 --> 1:06:09.820\n So like what,\n\n1:06:09.820 --> 1:06:14.220\n why do you think you're right and Tesla is wrong on this?\n\n1:06:14.220 --> 1:06:15.660\n And do you think,\n\n1:06:15.660 --> 1:06:17.540\n do you think you'll come around the Tesla way?\n\n1:06:17.540 --> 1:06:20.100\n Do you think Tesla will come around to your way?\n\n1:06:21.400 --> 1:06:23.920\n If you were to start a chess engine company,\n\n1:06:23.920 --> 1:06:26.080\n would you hire a Bishop guy?\n\n1:06:26.080 --> 1:06:27.660\n See, we have a,\n\n1:06:27.660 --> 1:06:29.060\n this is Monday morning.\n\n1:06:29.060 --> 1:06:33.740\n Quarterbacking is a yes, probably.\n\n1:06:36.340 --> 1:06:37.400\n Oh, our Rook guy.\n\n1:06:37.400 --> 1:06:39.420\n Oh, we stole the Rook guy from that company.\n\n1:06:39.420 --> 1:06:40.780\n Oh, we're going to have real good Rooks.\n\n1:06:40.780 --> 1:06:42.940\n Well, there's not many pieces, right?\n\n1:06:43.900 --> 1:06:44.740\n You can,\n\n1:06:46.220 --> 1:06:48.820\n there's not many guys and gals to hire.\n\n1:06:48.820 --> 1:06:51.060\n You just have a few that work in the Bishop,\n\n1:06:51.060 --> 1:06:52.860\n a few that work in the Rook.\n\n1:06:52.860 --> 1:06:55.340\n Is that not ludicrous today to think about\n\n1:06:55.340 --> 1:06:57.520\n in a world of AlphaZero?\n\n1:06:57.520 --> 1:06:58.860\n But AlphaZero is a chess game.\n\n1:06:58.860 --> 1:07:01.780\n So the fundamental question is,\n\n1:07:01.780 --> 1:07:04.340\n how hard is driving compared to chess?\n\n1:07:04.340 --> 1:07:07.200\n Because, so long term,\n\n1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:08.980\n end to end,\n\n1:07:08.980 --> 1:07:10.620\n will be the right solution.\n\n1:07:10.620 --> 1:07:13.460\n The question is how many years away is that?\n\n1:07:13.460 --> 1:07:15.740\n End to end is going to be the only solution for level five.\n\n1:07:15.740 --> 1:07:17.220\n For the only way we'll get there.\n\n1:07:17.220 --> 1:07:18.220\n Of course, and of course,\n\n1:07:18.220 --> 1:07:19.740\n Tesla is going to come around to my way.\n\n1:07:19.740 --> 1:07:22.980\n And if you're a Rook guy out there, I'm sorry.\n\n1:07:22.980 --> 1:07:23.940\n The cone guy.\n\n1:07:24.980 --> 1:07:25.820\n I don't know.\n\n1:07:25.820 --> 1:07:26.940\n We're going to specialize each task.\n\n1:07:26.940 --> 1:07:29.100\n We're going to really understand Rook placement.\n\n1:07:29.100 --> 1:07:30.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:30.540 --> 1:07:32.060\n I understand the intuition you have.\n\n1:07:32.060 --> 1:07:32.900\n I mean, that,\n\n1:07:35.100 --> 1:07:36.820\n that is a very compelling notion\n\n1:07:36.820 --> 1:07:39.140\n that we can learn the task end to end,\n\n1:07:39.140 --> 1:07:40.820\n like the same compelling notion you might have\n\n1:07:40.820 --> 1:07:42.620\n for natural language conversation.\n\n1:07:42.620 --> 1:07:43.460\n But I'm not\n\n1:07:44.800 --> 1:07:45.740\n sure,\n\n1:07:47.060 --> 1:07:48.940\n because one thing you sneaked in there\n\n1:07:48.940 --> 1:07:53.180\n is the assertion that it's impossible to get to level five\n\n1:07:53.180 --> 1:07:55.420\n without this kind of approach.\n\n1:07:55.420 --> 1:07:57.140\n I don't know if that's obvious.\n\n1:07:57.140 --> 1:07:58.300\n I don't know if that's obvious either.\n\n1:07:58.300 --> 1:08:01.340\n I don't actually mean that.\n\n1:08:01.340 --> 1:08:03.500\n I think that it is much easier\n\n1:08:03.500 --> 1:08:05.700\n to get to level five with an end to end approach.\n\n1:08:05.700 --> 1:08:08.900\n I think that the other approach is doable,\n\n1:08:08.900 --> 1:08:11.380\n but the magnitude of the engineering challenge\n\n1:08:11.380 --> 1:08:13.780\n may exceed what humanity is capable of.\n\n1:08:13.780 --> 1:08:18.780\n But what do you think of the Tesla data engine approach,\n\n1:08:19.140 --> 1:08:21.100\n which to me is an active learning task,\n\n1:08:21.100 --> 1:08:22.500\n is kind of fascinating,\n\n1:08:22.500 --> 1:08:25.700\n is breaking it down into these multiple tasks\n\n1:08:25.700 --> 1:08:29.500\n and mining their data constantly for like edge cases\n\n1:08:29.500 --> 1:08:30.500\n for these different tasks.\n\n1:08:30.500 --> 1:08:32.460\n Yeah, but the tasks themselves are not being learned.\n\n1:08:32.460 --> 1:08:33.860\n This is feature engineering.\n\n1:08:35.700 --> 1:08:40.700\n Yeah, I mean, it's a higher abstraction level\n\n1:08:40.740 --> 1:08:43.340\n of feature engineering for the different tasks.\n\n1:08:43.340 --> 1:08:44.740\n Task engineering in a sense.\n\n1:08:44.740 --> 1:08:46.780\n It's slightly better feature engineering,\n\n1:08:46.780 --> 1:08:49.260\n but it's still fundamentally is feature engineering.\n\n1:08:49.260 --> 1:08:51.300\n And if anything about the history of AI\n\n1:08:51.300 --> 1:08:52.620\n has taught us anything,\n\n1:08:52.620 --> 1:08:54.540\n it's that feature engineering approaches\n\n1:08:54.540 --> 1:08:57.660\n will always be replaced and lose to end to end.\n\n1:08:57.660 --> 1:09:02.060\n Now, to be fair, I cannot really make promises on timelines,\n\n1:09:02.060 --> 1:09:05.700\n but I can say that when you look at the code for Stockfish\n\n1:09:05.700 --> 1:09:06.940\n and the code for AlphaZero,\n\n1:09:06.940 --> 1:09:09.060\n one is a lot shorter than the other,\n\n1:09:09.060 --> 1:09:09.900\n a lot more elegant,\n\n1:09:09.900 --> 1:09:12.580\n required a lot less programmer hours to write.\n\n1:09:12.580 --> 1:09:17.580\n Yeah, but there was a lot more murder of bad agents\n\n1:09:21.620 --> 1:09:24.740\n on the AlphaZero side.\n\n1:09:24.740 --> 1:09:29.220\n By murder, I mean agents that played a game\n\n1:09:29.220 --> 1:09:30.420\n and failed miserably.\n\n1:09:30.420 --> 1:09:31.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:09:31.460 --> 1:09:32.300\n Oh, oh.\n\n1:09:32.300 --> 1:09:34.740\n In simulation, that failure is less costly.\n\n1:09:34.740 --> 1:09:35.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:09:35.580 --> 1:09:37.300\n In real world, it's...\n\n1:09:37.300 --> 1:09:38.260\n Do you mean in practice,\n\n1:09:38.260 --> 1:09:40.660\n like AlphaZero has lost games miserably?\n\n1:09:40.660 --> 1:09:41.500\n No.\n\n1:09:41.500 --> 1:09:42.540\n Wow.\n\n1:09:42.540 --> 1:09:43.380\n I haven't seen that.\n\n1:09:43.380 --> 1:09:47.380\n No, but I know, but the requirement for AlphaZero is...\n\n1:09:47.380 --> 1:09:48.220\n A simulator.\n\n1:09:48.220 --> 1:09:51.500\n To be able to like evolution, human evolution,\n\n1:09:51.500 --> 1:09:54.420\n not human evolution, biological evolution of life on earth\n\n1:09:54.420 --> 1:09:58.700\n from the origin of life has murdered trillions\n\n1:09:58.700 --> 1:10:02.260\n upon trillions of organisms on the path thus humans.\n\n1:10:02.260 --> 1:10:03.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:10:03.100 --> 1:10:05.860\n So the question is, can we stitch together\n\n1:10:05.860 --> 1:10:07.940\n a human like object without having to go\n\n1:10:07.940 --> 1:10:09.900\n through the entirety process of evolution?\n\n1:10:09.900 --> 1:10:11.940\n Well, no, but do the evolution in simulation.\n\n1:10:11.940 --> 1:10:12.860\n Yeah, that's the question.\n\n1:10:12.860 --> 1:10:13.700\n Can we simulate?\n\n1:10:13.700 --> 1:10:15.060\n So do you have a sense that it's possible\n\n1:10:15.060 --> 1:10:16.220\n to simulate some aspect?\n\n1:10:16.220 --> 1:10:18.220\n MuZero is exactly this.\n\n1:10:18.220 --> 1:10:21.300\n MuZero is the solution to this.\n\n1:10:21.300 --> 1:10:23.980\n MuZero I think is going to be looked back\n\n1:10:23.980 --> 1:10:25.220\n as the canonical paper.\n\n1:10:25.220 --> 1:10:26.860\n And I don't think deep learning is everything.\n\n1:10:26.860 --> 1:10:28.700\n I think that there's still a bunch of things missing\n\n1:10:28.700 --> 1:10:31.420\n to get there, but MuZero I think is going to be looked back\n\n1:10:31.420 --> 1:10:34.260\n as the kind of cornerstone paper\n\n1:10:34.260 --> 1:10:37.060\n of this whole deep learning era.\n\n1:10:37.060 --> 1:10:39.580\n And MuZero is the solution to self driving cars.\n\n1:10:39.580 --> 1:10:41.220\n You have to make a few tweaks to it,\n\n1:10:41.220 --> 1:10:42.820\n but MuZero does effectively that.\n\n1:10:42.820 --> 1:10:45.500\n It does those rollouts and those murdering\n\n1:10:45.500 --> 1:10:48.740\n in a learned simulator and a learned dynamics model.\n\n1:10:50.180 --> 1:10:51.020\n That's interesting.\n\n1:10:51.020 --> 1:10:51.860\n It doesn't get enough love.\n\n1:10:51.860 --> 1:10:54.220\n I was blown away when I read that paper.\n\n1:10:54.220 --> 1:10:57.060\n I'm like, okay, I've always said a comma.\n\n1:10:57.060 --> 1:10:58.460\n I'm going to sit and I'm going to wait for the solution\n\n1:10:58.460 --> 1:11:00.340\n to self driving cars to come along.\n\n1:11:00.340 --> 1:11:01.180\n This year I saw it.\n\n1:11:01.180 --> 1:11:02.020\n It's MuZero.\n\n1:11:05.060 --> 1:11:05.900\n So.\n\n1:11:06.860 --> 1:11:09.180\n Sit back and let the winning roll in.\n\n1:11:09.180 --> 1:11:12.300\n So your sense, just to elaborate a little bit,\n\n1:11:12.300 --> 1:11:13.380\n it's a link on the topic.\n\n1:11:13.380 --> 1:11:16.300\n Your sense is neural networks will solve driving.\n\n1:11:16.300 --> 1:11:17.140\n Yes.\n\n1:11:17.140 --> 1:11:18.820\n Like we don't need anything else.\n\n1:11:18.820 --> 1:11:21.260\n I think the same way chess was maybe the chess\n\n1:11:21.260 --> 1:11:25.060\n and maybe Google are the pinnacle of like search algorithms\n\n1:11:25.060 --> 1:11:27.100\n and things that look kind of like a star.\n\n1:11:28.420 --> 1:11:32.780\n The pinnacle of this era is going to be self driving cars.\n\n1:11:34.700 --> 1:11:38.180\n But on the path of that, you have to deliver products\n\n1:11:38.180 --> 1:11:42.340\n and it's possible that the path to full self driving cars\n\n1:11:42.340 --> 1:11:44.420\n will take decades.\n\n1:11:44.420 --> 1:11:45.340\n I doubt it.\n\n1:11:45.340 --> 1:11:46.980\n How long would you put on it?\n\n1:11:47.820 --> 1:11:52.420\n Like what are we, you're chasing it, Tesla's chasing it.\n\n1:11:53.460 --> 1:11:54.340\n What are we talking about?\n\n1:11:54.340 --> 1:11:56.180\n Five years, 10 years, 50 years.\n\n1:11:56.180 --> 1:11:58.060\n Let's say in the 2020s.\n\n1:11:58.060 --> 1:11:59.540\n In the 2020s.\n\n1:11:59.540 --> 1:12:01.180\n The later part of the 2020s.\n\n1:12:03.580 --> 1:12:05.500\n With the neural network.\n\n1:12:05.500 --> 1:12:06.580\n Well, that would be nice to see.\n\n1:12:06.580 --> 1:12:09.140\n And then the path to that, you're delivering products,\n\n1:12:09.140 --> 1:12:10.580\n which is a nice L2 system.\n\n1:12:10.580 --> 1:12:13.060\n That's what Tesla's doing, a nice L2 system.\n\n1:12:13.060 --> 1:12:14.380\n Just gets better every time.\n\n1:12:14.380 --> 1:12:16.660\n L2, the only difference between L2 and the other levels\n\n1:12:16.660 --> 1:12:17.620\n is who takes liability.\n\n1:12:17.620 --> 1:12:20.100\n And I'm not a liability guy, I don't wanna take liability.\n\n1:12:20.100 --> 1:12:21.540\n I'm gonna level two forever.\n\n1:12:22.700 --> 1:12:25.780\n Now on that little transition,\n\n1:12:25.780 --> 1:12:29.060\n I mean, how do you make the transition work?\n\n1:12:29.060 --> 1:12:32.780\n Is this where driver sensing comes in?\n\n1:12:32.780 --> 1:12:35.940\n Like how do you make the, cause you said a hundred miles,\n\n1:12:35.940 --> 1:12:40.940\n like, is there some sort of human factor psychology thing\n\n1:12:41.340 --> 1:12:43.140\n where people start to overtrust the system,\n\n1:12:43.140 --> 1:12:45.020\n all those kinds of effects,\n\n1:12:45.020 --> 1:12:46.780\n once it gets better and better and better and better,\n\n1:12:46.780 --> 1:12:49.340\n they get lazier and lazier and lazier.\n\n1:12:49.340 --> 1:12:52.460\n Is that, like, how do you get that transition right?\n\n1:12:52.460 --> 1:12:54.500\n First off, our monitoring is already adaptive.\n\n1:12:54.500 --> 1:12:56.620\n Our monitoring is already seen adaptive.\n\n1:12:56.620 --> 1:12:58.940\n Driver monitoring is just the camera\n\n1:12:58.940 --> 1:13:00.060\n that's looking at the driver.\n\n1:13:00.060 --> 1:13:03.060\n You have an infrared camera in the...\n\n1:13:03.060 --> 1:13:06.340\n Our policy for how we enforce the driver monitoring\n\n1:13:06.340 --> 1:13:07.940\n is seen adaptive.\n\n1:13:07.940 --> 1:13:08.780\n What's that mean?\n\n1:13:08.780 --> 1:13:11.420\n Well, for example, in one of the extreme cases,\n\n1:13:12.580 --> 1:13:14.860\n if the car is not moving,\n\n1:13:14.860 --> 1:13:19.460\n we do not actively enforce driver monitoring, right?\n\n1:13:19.460 --> 1:13:22.380\n If you are going through a,\n\n1:13:22.380 --> 1:13:24.860\n like a 45 mile an hour road with lights\n\n1:13:25.780 --> 1:13:27.980\n and stop signs and potentially pedestrians,\n\n1:13:27.980 --> 1:13:30.780\n we enforce a very tight driver monitoring policy.\n\n1:13:30.780 --> 1:13:33.860\n If you are alone on a perfectly straight highway,\n\n1:13:33.860 --> 1:13:35.620\n and this is, it's all machine learning.\n\n1:13:35.620 --> 1:13:36.940\n None of that is hand coded.\n\n1:13:36.940 --> 1:13:39.060\n Actually, the stop is hand coded, but...\n\n1:13:39.060 --> 1:13:41.100\n So there's some kind of machine learning\n\n1:13:41.100 --> 1:13:42.300\n estimation of risk.\n\n1:13:42.300 --> 1:13:43.620\n Yes.\n\n1:13:43.620 --> 1:13:44.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:13:44.460 --> 1:13:45.860\n I mean, I've always been a huge fan of that.\n\n1:13:45.860 --> 1:13:47.500\n That's a...\n\n1:13:47.500 --> 1:13:48.340\n Because...\n\n1:13:48.340 --> 1:13:53.340\n It's difficult to do every step into that direction\n\n1:13:53.780 --> 1:13:55.100\n is a worthwhile step to take.\n\n1:13:55.100 --> 1:13:56.540\n It might be difficult to do really well.\n\n1:13:56.540 --> 1:13:59.980\n Like us humans are able to estimate risk pretty damn well,\n\n1:13:59.980 --> 1:14:01.500\n whatever the hell that is.\n\n1:14:01.500 --> 1:14:05.540\n That feels like one of the nice features of us humans.\n\n1:14:06.500 --> 1:14:08.980\n Cause like we humans are really good drivers\n\n1:14:08.980 --> 1:14:11.180\n when we're really like tuned in\n\n1:14:11.180 --> 1:14:12.940\n and we're good at estimating risk.\n\n1:14:12.940 --> 1:14:14.900\n Like when are we supposed to be tuned in?\n\n1:14:14.900 --> 1:14:15.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:15.980 --> 1:14:17.580\n And, you know, people are like,\n\n1:14:17.580 --> 1:14:18.420\n oh, well, you know,\n\n1:14:18.420 --> 1:14:20.420\n why would you ever make the driver monitoring policy\n\n1:14:20.420 --> 1:14:21.260\n less aggressive?\n\n1:14:21.260 --> 1:14:23.980\n Why would you always not keep it at its most aggressive?\n\n1:14:23.980 --> 1:14:25.780\n Because then people are just going to get fatigued from it.\n\n1:14:25.780 --> 1:14:26.620\n Yes.\n\n1:14:26.620 --> 1:14:27.460\n When they get annoyed.\n\n1:14:27.460 --> 1:14:28.300\n You want them...\n\n1:14:28.300 --> 1:14:29.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:29.140 --> 1:14:30.900\n You want the experience to be pleasant.\n\n1:14:30.900 --> 1:14:32.500\n Obviously I want the experience to be pleasant,\n\n1:14:32.500 --> 1:14:35.980\n but even just from a straight up safety perspective,\n\n1:14:35.980 --> 1:14:39.740\n if you alert people when they look around and they're like,\n\n1:14:39.740 --> 1:14:41.020\n why is this thing alerting me?\n\n1:14:41.020 --> 1:14:42.980\n There's nothing I could possibly hit right now.\n\n1:14:42.980 --> 1:14:45.220\n People will just learn to tune it out.\n\n1:14:45.220 --> 1:14:46.900\n People will just learn to tune it out,\n\n1:14:46.900 --> 1:14:48.060\n to put weights on the steering wheel,\n\n1:14:48.060 --> 1:14:49.820\n to do whatever to overcome it.\n\n1:14:49.820 --> 1:14:52.580\n And remember that you're always part\n\n1:14:52.580 --> 1:14:53.580\n of this adaptive system.\n\n1:14:53.580 --> 1:14:55.660\n So all I can really say about, you know,\n\n1:14:55.660 --> 1:14:57.180\n how this scales going forward is yeah,\n\n1:14:57.180 --> 1:14:59.420\n it's something we have to monitor for.\n\n1:14:59.420 --> 1:15:00.260\n Ooh, we don't know.\n\n1:15:00.260 --> 1:15:02.060\n This is a great psychology experiment at scale.\n\n1:15:02.060 --> 1:15:03.220\n Like we'll see.\n\n1:15:03.220 --> 1:15:04.060\n Yeah, it's fascinating.\n\n1:15:04.060 --> 1:15:04.900\n Track it.\n\n1:15:04.900 --> 1:15:09.140\n And making sure you have a good understanding of attention\n\n1:15:09.140 --> 1:15:11.420\n is a very key part of that psychology problem.\n\n1:15:11.420 --> 1:15:12.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:12.260 --> 1:15:14.100\n I think you and I probably have a different,\n\n1:15:14.100 --> 1:15:16.660\n come to it differently, but to me,\n\n1:15:16.660 --> 1:15:19.700\n it's a fascinating psychology problem\n\n1:15:19.700 --> 1:15:22.100\n to explore something much deeper than just driving.\n\n1:15:22.100 --> 1:15:26.700\n It's such a nice way to explore human attention\n\n1:15:26.700 --> 1:15:30.180\n and human behavior, which is why, again,\n\n1:15:30.180 --> 1:15:34.100\n we've probably both criticized Mr. Elon Musk\n\n1:15:34.100 --> 1:15:38.220\n on this one topic from different avenues.\n\n1:15:38.220 --> 1:15:39.740\n So both offline and online,\n\n1:15:39.740 --> 1:15:44.380\n I had little chats with Elon and like,\n\n1:15:44.380 --> 1:15:48.620\n I love human beings as a computer vision problem,\n\n1:15:48.620 --> 1:15:51.020\n as an AI problem, it's fascinating.\n\n1:15:51.020 --> 1:15:53.260\n He wasn't so much interested in that problem.\n\n1:15:53.260 --> 1:15:56.820\n It's like in order to solve driving,\n\n1:15:56.820 --> 1:15:58.780\n the whole point is you want to remove the human\n\n1:15:58.780 --> 1:15:59.780\n from the picture.\n\n1:16:01.300 --> 1:16:04.140\n And it seems like you can't do that quite yet.\n\n1:16:04.140 --> 1:16:07.900\n Eventually, yes, but you can't quite do that yet.\n\n1:16:07.900 --> 1:16:12.300\n So this is the moment where you can't yet say,\n\n1:16:12.300 --> 1:16:17.300\n I told you so to Tesla, but it's getting there\n\n1:16:17.700 --> 1:16:19.220\n because I don't know if you've seen this,\n\n1:16:19.220 --> 1:16:21.100\n there's some reporting that they're in fact\n\n1:16:21.100 --> 1:16:23.260\n starting to do driver monitoring.\n\n1:16:23.260 --> 1:16:25.020\n Yeah, they shift the model in shadow mode.\n\n1:16:26.260 --> 1:16:29.620\n With, I believe, only a visible light camera,\n\n1:16:29.620 --> 1:16:31.780\n it might even be fisheye.\n\n1:16:31.780 --> 1:16:33.260\n It's like a low resolution.\n\n1:16:33.260 --> 1:16:34.820\n Low resolution, visible light.\n\n1:16:34.820 --> 1:16:37.100\n I mean, to be fair, that's what we have in the Eon as well,\n\n1:16:37.100 --> 1:16:38.820\n our last generation product.\n\n1:16:38.820 --> 1:16:41.060\n This is the one area where I can say\n\n1:16:41.060 --> 1:16:42.180\n our hardware is ahead of Tesla.\n\n1:16:42.180 --> 1:16:43.820\n The rest of our hardware, way, way behind,\n\n1:16:43.820 --> 1:16:46.020\n but our driver monitoring camera.\n\n1:16:46.020 --> 1:16:50.940\n So you think, I think on the third row Tesla podcast,\n\n1:16:50.940 --> 1:16:54.580\n or somewhere else, I've heard you say that obviously,\n\n1:16:54.580 --> 1:16:57.220\n eventually they're gonna have driver monitoring.\n\n1:16:57.220 --> 1:16:59.660\n I think what I've said is Elon will definitely ship\n\n1:16:59.660 --> 1:17:01.700\n driver monitoring before he ships level five.\n\n1:17:01.700 --> 1:17:02.540\n Before level five.\n\n1:17:02.540 --> 1:17:04.660\n And I'm willing to bet 10 grand on that.\n\n1:17:04.660 --> 1:17:06.180\n And you bet 10 grand on that.\n\n1:17:07.060 --> 1:17:08.260\n I mean, now I don't wanna take the bet,\n\n1:17:08.260 --> 1:17:09.500\n but before, maybe someone would have,\n\n1:17:09.500 --> 1:17:10.500\n oh, I should have got my money in.\n\n1:17:10.500 --> 1:17:11.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:17:11.900 --> 1:17:12.980\n It's an interesting bet.\n\n1:17:12.980 --> 1:17:16.460\n I think you're right.\n\n1:17:16.460 --> 1:17:19.180\n I'm actually on a human level\n\n1:17:19.180 --> 1:17:24.180\n because he's been, he's made the decision.\n\n1:17:24.380 --> 1:17:27.660\n Like he said that driver monitoring is the wrong way to go.\n\n1:17:27.660 --> 1:17:31.260\n But like, you have to think of as a human, as a CEO,\n\n1:17:31.260 --> 1:17:34.980\n I think that's the right thing to say when,\n\n1:17:36.460 --> 1:17:40.140\n like sometimes you have to say things publicly\n\n1:17:40.140 --> 1:17:41.780\n that are different than when you actually believe,\n\n1:17:41.780 --> 1:17:45.420\n because when you're producing a large number of vehicles\n\n1:17:45.420 --> 1:17:47.860\n and the decision was made not to include the camera,\n\n1:17:47.860 --> 1:17:49.460\n like what are you supposed to say?\n\n1:17:49.460 --> 1:17:51.780\n Like our cars don't have the thing\n\n1:17:51.780 --> 1:17:54.020\n that I think is right to have.\n\n1:17:54.020 --> 1:17:55.780\n It's an interesting thing.\n\n1:17:55.780 --> 1:17:58.340\n But like on the other side, as a CEO,\n\n1:17:58.340 --> 1:18:01.220\n I mean, something you could probably speak to as a leader,\n\n1:18:01.220 --> 1:18:03.820\n I think about me as a human\n\n1:18:04.940 --> 1:18:07.020\n to publicly change your mind on something.\n\n1:18:07.020 --> 1:18:08.420\n How hard is that?\n\n1:18:08.420 --> 1:18:10.620\n Especially when assholes like George Haas say,\n\n1:18:10.620 --> 1:18:12.380\n I told you so.\n\n1:18:12.380 --> 1:18:14.740\n All I will say is I am not a leader\n\n1:18:14.740 --> 1:18:17.060\n and I am happy to change my mind.\n\n1:18:17.060 --> 1:18:17.900\n And I will.\n\n1:18:17.900 --> 1:18:18.740\n You think Elon will?\n\n1:18:20.580 --> 1:18:21.420\n Yeah, I do.\n\n1:18:22.300 --> 1:18:24.260\n I think he'll come up with a good way\n\n1:18:24.260 --> 1:18:27.420\n to make it psychologically okay for him.\n\n1:18:27.420 --> 1:18:29.700\n Well, it's such an important thing, man.\n\n1:18:29.700 --> 1:18:31.420\n Especially for a first principles thinker,\n\n1:18:31.420 --> 1:18:34.780\n because he made a decision that driver monitoring\n\n1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:35.740\n is not the right way to go.\n\n1:18:35.740 --> 1:18:37.660\n And I could see that decision.\n\n1:18:37.660 --> 1:18:39.260\n And I could even make that decision.\n\n1:18:39.260 --> 1:18:41.660\n Like I was on the fence too.\n\n1:18:41.660 --> 1:18:42.500\n Like I'm not a,\n\n1:18:42.500 --> 1:18:47.140\n driver monitoring is such an obvious,\n\n1:18:47.140 --> 1:18:49.980\n simple solution to the problem of attention.\n\n1:18:49.980 --> 1:18:52.820\n It's not obvious to me that just by putting a camera there,\n\n1:18:52.820 --> 1:18:54.260\n you solve things.\n\n1:18:54.260 --> 1:18:59.060\n You have to create an incredible, compelling experience.\n\n1:18:59.060 --> 1:19:01.060\n Just like you're talking about.\n\n1:19:01.060 --> 1:19:03.300\n I don't know if it's easy to do that.\n\n1:19:03.300 --> 1:19:05.980\n It's not at all easy to do that, in fact, I think.\n\n1:19:05.980 --> 1:19:10.980\n So as a creator of a car that's trying to create a product\n\n1:19:10.980 --> 1:19:14.180\n that people love, which is what Tesla tries to do, right?\n\n1:19:14.180 --> 1:19:18.340\n It's not obvious to me that as a design decision,\n\n1:19:18.340 --> 1:19:20.940\n whether adding a camera is a good idea.\n\n1:19:20.940 --> 1:19:22.460\n From a safety perspective either,\n\n1:19:22.460 --> 1:19:25.100\n like in the human factors community,\n\n1:19:25.100 --> 1:19:27.380\n everybody says that you should obviously\n\n1:19:27.380 --> 1:19:30.500\n have driver sensing, driver monitoring.\n\n1:19:30.500 --> 1:19:35.500\n But that's like saying it's obvious as parents,\n\n1:19:36.900 --> 1:19:39.780\n you shouldn't let your kids go out at night.\n\n1:19:39.780 --> 1:19:43.460\n But okay, but like,\n\n1:19:43.460 --> 1:19:45.620\n they're still gonna find ways to do drugs.\n\n1:19:45.620 --> 1:19:49.860\n Like, you have to also be good parents.\n\n1:19:49.860 --> 1:19:52.580\n So like, it's much more complicated than just the,\n\n1:19:52.580 --> 1:19:54.140\n you need to have driver monitoring.\n\n1:19:54.140 --> 1:19:58.740\n I totally disagree on, okay, if you have a camera there\n\n1:19:58.740 --> 1:20:00.300\n and the camera's watching the person,\n\n1:20:00.300 --> 1:20:03.540\n but never throws an alert, they'll never think about it.\n\n1:20:03.540 --> 1:20:04.380\n Right?\n\n1:20:04.380 --> 1:20:08.380\n The driver monitoring policy that you choose to,\n\n1:20:08.380 --> 1:20:10.180\n how you choose to communicate with the user\n\n1:20:10.180 --> 1:20:14.220\n is entirely separate from the data collection perspective.\n\n1:20:14.220 --> 1:20:15.060\n Right?\n\n1:20:15.060 --> 1:20:15.900\n Right?\n\n1:20:15.900 --> 1:20:20.900\n So, you know, like, there's one thing to say,\n\n1:20:20.980 --> 1:20:24.500\n like, you know, tell your teenager they can't do something.\n\n1:20:24.500 --> 1:20:27.020\n There's another thing to like, you know, gather the data.\n\n1:20:27.020 --> 1:20:28.500\n So you can make informed decisions.\n\n1:20:28.500 --> 1:20:29.340\n That's really interesting.\n\n1:20:29.340 --> 1:20:30.980\n But you have to make that,\n\n1:20:30.980 --> 1:20:33.380\n that's the interesting thing about cars.\n\n1:20:33.380 --> 1:20:35.020\n But even true with common AI,\n\n1:20:35.020 --> 1:20:37.900\n like you don't have to manufacture the thing\n\n1:20:37.900 --> 1:20:40.060\n into the car, is you have to make a decision\n\n1:20:40.060 --> 1:20:44.180\n that anticipates the right strategy longterm.\n\n1:20:44.180 --> 1:20:46.620\n So like, you have to start collecting the data\n\n1:20:46.620 --> 1:20:47.780\n and start making decisions.\n\n1:20:47.780 --> 1:20:49.900\n Started it three years ago.\n\n1:20:49.900 --> 1:20:52.660\n I believe that we have the best driver monitoring solution\n\n1:20:52.660 --> 1:20:53.500\n in the world.\n\n1:20:54.620 --> 1:20:57.220\n I think that when you compare it to Super Cruise\n\n1:20:57.220 --> 1:20:59.460\n is the only other one that I really know that shipped.\n\n1:20:59.460 --> 1:21:01.420\n And ours is better.\n\n1:21:01.420 --> 1:21:06.420\n What do you like and not like about Super Cruise?\n\n1:21:06.420 --> 1:21:08.740\n I mean, I had a few Super Cruise,\n\n1:21:08.740 --> 1:21:12.020\n the sun would be shining through the window,\n\n1:21:12.020 --> 1:21:13.180\n would blind the camera,\n\n1:21:13.180 --> 1:21:14.580\n and it would say I wasn't paying attention.\n\n1:21:14.580 --> 1:21:16.100\n When I was looking completely straight,\n\n1:21:16.100 --> 1:21:19.140\n I couldn't reset the attention with a steering wheel touch\n\n1:21:19.140 --> 1:21:21.060\n and Super Cruise would disengage.\n\n1:21:21.060 --> 1:21:22.980\n Like I was communicating to the car, I'm like, look,\n\n1:21:22.980 --> 1:21:24.420\n I am here, I am paying attention.\n\n1:21:24.420 --> 1:21:26.340\n Why are you really gonna force me to disengage?\n\n1:21:26.340 --> 1:21:27.380\n And it did.\n\n1:21:28.620 --> 1:21:32.100\n So it's a constant conversation with the user.\n\n1:21:32.100 --> 1:21:33.660\n And yeah, there's no way to ship a system\n\n1:21:33.660 --> 1:21:35.500\n like this if you can OTA.\n\n1:21:35.500 --> 1:21:37.180\n We're shipping a new one every month.\n\n1:21:37.180 --> 1:21:40.140\n Sometimes we balance it with our users on Discord.\n\n1:21:40.140 --> 1:21:41.980\n Like sometimes we make the driver monitoring\n\n1:21:41.980 --> 1:21:43.820\n a little more aggressive and people complain.\n\n1:21:43.820 --> 1:21:45.500\n Sometimes they don't.\n\n1:21:45.500 --> 1:21:47.060\n We want it to be as aggressive as possible\n\n1:21:47.060 --> 1:21:49.180\n where people don't complain and it doesn't feel intrusive.\n\n1:21:49.180 --> 1:21:51.100\n So being able to update the system over the air\n\n1:21:51.100 --> 1:21:52.540\n is an essential component.\n\n1:21:52.540 --> 1:21:55.300\n I mean, that's probably to me, you mentioned,\n\n1:21:56.620 --> 1:22:01.060\n I mean, to me that is the biggest innovation of Tesla,\n\n1:22:01.060 --> 1:22:04.860\n that it made people realize that over the air updates\n\n1:22:04.860 --> 1:22:06.460\n is essential.\n\n1:22:06.460 --> 1:22:07.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:22:07.460 --> 1:22:10.140\n I mean, was that not obvious from the iPhone?\n\n1:22:10.140 --> 1:22:13.060\n The iPhone was the first real product that OTA'd, I think.\n\n1:22:13.060 --> 1:22:15.220\n Was it actually, that's brilliant, you're right.\n\n1:22:15.220 --> 1:22:17.060\n I mean, the game consoles used to not, right?\n\n1:22:17.060 --> 1:22:18.980\n The game consoles were maybe the second thing that did.\n\n1:22:18.980 --> 1:22:22.260\n Wow, I didn't really think about one of the amazing features\n\n1:22:22.260 --> 1:22:26.180\n of a smartphone isn't just like the touchscreen\n\n1:22:26.180 --> 1:22:30.740\n isn't the thing, it's the ability to constantly update.\n\n1:22:30.740 --> 1:22:31.980\n Yeah, it gets better.\n\n1:22:31.980 --> 1:22:35.100\n It gets better.\n\n1:22:35.100 --> 1:22:36.820\n Love my iOS 14.\n\n1:22:36.820 --> 1:22:38.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:22:38.300 --> 1:22:41.540\n Well, one thing that I probably disagree with you\n\n1:22:41.540 --> 1:22:45.580\n on driver monitoring is you said that it's easy.\n\n1:22:46.700 --> 1:22:48.940\n I mean, you tend to say stuff is easy.\n\n1:22:48.940 --> 1:22:52.700\n I'm sure the, I guess you said it's easy\n\n1:22:52.700 --> 1:22:55.500\n relative to the external perception problem.\n\n1:22:58.180 --> 1:23:00.940\n Can you elaborate why you think it's easy?\n\n1:23:00.940 --> 1:23:03.500\n Feature engineering works for driver monitoring.\n\n1:23:03.500 --> 1:23:05.860\n Feature engineering does not work for the external.\n\n1:23:05.860 --> 1:23:10.700\n So human faces are not, human faces and the movement\n\n1:23:10.700 --> 1:23:14.740\n of human faces and head and body is not as variable\n\n1:23:14.740 --> 1:23:17.140\n as the external environment, is your intuition?\n\n1:23:17.140 --> 1:23:20.140\n Yes, and there's another big difference as well.\n\n1:23:20.140 --> 1:23:22.500\n Your reliability of a driver monitoring system\n\n1:23:22.500 --> 1:23:24.380\n doesn't actually need to be that high.\n\n1:23:24.380 --> 1:23:27.220\n The uncertainty, if you have something that's detecting\n\n1:23:27.220 --> 1:23:29.140\n whether the human's paying attention and it only works\n\n1:23:29.140 --> 1:23:31.700\n 92% of the time, you're still getting almost all\n\n1:23:31.700 --> 1:23:33.620\n the benefit of that because the human,\n\n1:23:33.620 --> 1:23:35.500\n like you're training the human, right?\n\n1:23:35.500 --> 1:23:39.100\n You're dealing with a system that's really helping you out.\n\n1:23:39.100 --> 1:23:40.180\n It's a conversation.\n\n1:23:40.180 --> 1:23:43.460\n It's not like the external thing where guess what?\n\n1:23:43.460 --> 1:23:46.140\n If you swerve into a tree, you swerve into a tree, right?\n\n1:23:46.140 --> 1:23:48.340\n Like you get no margin for error there.\n\n1:23:48.340 --> 1:23:49.620\n Yeah, I think that's really well put.\n\n1:23:49.620 --> 1:23:54.020\n I think that's the right, exactly the place\n\n1:23:54.020 --> 1:23:58.660\n where comparing to the external perception,\n\n1:23:58.660 --> 1:24:01.500\n the control problem, the driver monitoring is easier\n\n1:24:01.500 --> 1:24:04.400\n because you don't, the bar for success is much lower.\n\n1:24:05.260 --> 1:24:09.100\n Yeah, but I still think like the human face\n\n1:24:09.100 --> 1:24:12.140\n is more complicated actually than the external environment,\n\n1:24:12.140 --> 1:24:14.380\n but for driving, you don't give a damn.\n\n1:24:14.380 --> 1:24:15.620\n I don't need, yeah, I don't need something,\n\n1:24:15.620 --> 1:24:18.300\n I don't need something that complicated\n\n1:24:18.300 --> 1:24:22.220\n to have to communicate the idea to the human\n\n1:24:22.220 --> 1:24:23.980\n that I want to communicate, which is,\n\n1:24:23.980 --> 1:24:25.740\n yo, system might mess up here.\n\n1:24:25.740 --> 1:24:26.940\n You gotta pay attention.\n\n1:24:26.940 --> 1:24:31.940\n Yeah, see, that's my love and fascination is the human face.\n\n1:24:32.500 --> 1:24:37.500\n And it feels like this is a nice place to create products\n\n1:24:38.420 --> 1:24:40.100\n that create an experience in the car.\n\n1:24:40.100 --> 1:24:42.640\n So like, it feels like there should be\n\n1:24:42.640 --> 1:24:47.540\n more richer experiences in the car, you know?\n\n1:24:47.540 --> 1:24:51.500\n Like that's an opportunity for like something like On My Eye\n\n1:24:51.500 --> 1:24:53.900\n or just any kind of system like a Tesla\n\n1:24:53.900 --> 1:24:56.220\n or any of the autonomous vehicle companies\n\n1:24:56.220 --> 1:24:59.180\n is because software is, there's much more sensors\n\n1:24:59.180 --> 1:25:00.660\n and so much is on our software\n\n1:25:00.660 --> 1:25:02.940\n and you're doing machine learning anyway,\n\n1:25:02.940 --> 1:25:06.340\n there's an opportunity to create totally new experiences\n\n1:25:06.340 --> 1:25:08.260\n that we're not even anticipating.\n\n1:25:08.260 --> 1:25:09.180\n You don't think so?\n\n1:25:10.140 --> 1:25:10.980\n Nah.\n\n1:25:10.980 --> 1:25:12.900\n You think it's a box that gets you from A to B\n\n1:25:12.900 --> 1:25:14.920\n and you want to do it chill?\n\n1:25:14.920 --> 1:25:16.940\n Yeah, I mean, I think as soon as we get to level three\n\n1:25:16.940 --> 1:25:19.300\n on highways, okay, enjoy your candy crush,\n\n1:25:19.300 --> 1:25:23.660\n enjoy your Hulu, enjoy your, you know, whatever, whatever.\n\n1:25:23.660 --> 1:25:26.260\n Sure, you get this, you can look at screens basically\n\n1:25:26.260 --> 1:25:28.700\n versus right now where you have music and audio books.\n\n1:25:28.700 --> 1:25:31.020\n So level three is where you can kind of disengage\n\n1:25:31.020 --> 1:25:32.280\n in stretches of time.\n\n1:25:34.860 --> 1:25:37.460\n Well, you think level three is possible?\n\n1:25:37.460 --> 1:25:39.180\n Like on the highway going for 100 miles\n\n1:25:39.180 --> 1:25:40.500\n and you can just go to sleep?\n\n1:25:40.500 --> 1:25:43.620\n Oh yeah, sleep.\n\n1:25:43.620 --> 1:25:47.340\n So again, I think it's really all on a spectrum.\n\n1:25:47.340 --> 1:25:50.060\n I think that being able to use your phone\n\n1:25:50.060 --> 1:25:53.500\n while you're on the highway and like this all being okay\n\n1:25:53.500 --> 1:25:55.360\n and being aware that the car might alert you\n\n1:25:55.360 --> 1:25:57.180\n and you have five seconds to basically.\n\n1:25:57.180 --> 1:25:59.060\n So the five second thing is you think is possible?\n\n1:25:59.060 --> 1:26:00.420\n Yeah, I think it is, oh yeah.\n\n1:26:00.420 --> 1:26:02.180\n Not in all scenarios, right?\n\n1:26:02.180 --> 1:26:03.940\n Some scenarios it's not.\n\n1:26:03.940 --> 1:26:06.300\n It's the whole risk thing that you mentioned is nice\n\n1:26:06.300 --> 1:26:10.660\n is to be able to estimate like how risky is this situation?\n\n1:26:10.660 --> 1:26:12.620\n That's really important to understand.\n\n1:26:12.620 --> 1:26:15.380\n One other thing you mentioned comparing KAMA\n\n1:26:15.380 --> 1:26:20.380\n and Autopilot is that something about the haptic feel\n\n1:26:20.380 --> 1:26:25.380\n of the way KAMA controls the car when things are uncertain.\n\n1:26:25.920 --> 1:26:27.760\n Like it behaves a little bit more uncertain\n\n1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:29.240\n when things are uncertain.\n\n1:26:29.240 --> 1:26:31.080\n That's kind of an interesting point.\n\n1:26:31.080 --> 1:26:34.080\n And then Autopilot is much more confident always\n\n1:26:34.080 --> 1:26:37.460\n even when it's uncertain until it runs into trouble.\n\n1:26:39.200 --> 1:26:40.920\n That's a funny thing.\n\n1:26:40.920 --> 1:26:42.700\n I actually mentioned that to Elon, I think.\n\n1:26:42.700 --> 1:26:46.280\n And then the first time we talked, he wasn't biting.\n\n1:26:46.280 --> 1:26:48.880\n It's like communicating uncertainty.\n\n1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:51.880\n I guess KAMA doesn't really communicate uncertainty\n\n1:26:51.880 --> 1:26:55.040\n explicitly, it communicates it through haptic feel.\n\n1:26:55.040 --> 1:26:57.420\n Like what's the role of communicating uncertainty\n\n1:26:57.420 --> 1:26:58.260\n do you think?\n\n1:26:58.260 --> 1:26:59.840\n Oh, we do some stuff explicitly.\n\n1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:01.800\n Like we do detect the lanes when you're on the highway\n\n1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:04.380\n and we'll show you how many lanes we're using to drive with.\n\n1:27:04.380 --> 1:27:06.200\n You can look at where it thinks the lanes are.\n\n1:27:06.200 --> 1:27:08.480\n You can look at the path.\n\n1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:10.440\n And we want to be better about this.\n\n1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:12.900\n We're actually hiring, want to hire some new UI people.\n\n1:27:12.900 --> 1:27:14.320\n UI people, you mentioned this.\n\n1:27:14.320 --> 1:27:17.300\n Cause it's such an, it's a UI problem too, right?\n\n1:27:17.300 --> 1:27:19.720\n We have a great designer now, but you know,\n\n1:27:19.720 --> 1:27:21.160\n we need people who are just going to like build this\n\n1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:23.800\n and debug these UIs, QT people.\n\n1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:24.640\n QT.\n\n1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:26.880\n Is that what the UI is done with, is QT?\n\n1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:27.980\n The new UI is in QT.\n\n1:27:29.320 --> 1:27:30.520\n C++ QT?\n\n1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:33.300\n Tesla uses it too.\n\n1:27:33.300 --> 1:27:34.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:34.200 --> 1:27:36.060\n We had some React stuff in there.\n\n1:27:37.760 --> 1:27:39.440\n React JS or just React?\n\n1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:41.160\n React is his own language, right?\n\n1:27:41.160 --> 1:27:44.480\n React Native, React is a JavaScript framework.\n\n1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:45.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:48.960\n So it's all based on JavaScript, but it's, you know,\n\n1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:49.800\n I like C++.\n\n1:27:51.480 --> 1:27:55.080\n What do you think about Dojo with Tesla\n\n1:27:55.080 --> 1:27:58.760\n and their foray into what appears to be\n\n1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:03.340\n specialized hardware for training your own nets?\n\n1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:07.360\n I guess it's something, maybe you can correct me,\n\n1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:10.000\n from my shallow looking at it,\n\n1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.120\n it seems like something like Google did with TPUs,\n\n1:28:12.120 --> 1:28:15.680\n but specialized for driving data.\n\n1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:18.360\n I don't think it's specialized for driving data.\n\n1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:20.120\n It's just legit, just TPU.\n\n1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:22.160\n They want to go the Apple way,\n\n1:28:22.160 --> 1:28:25.640\n basically everything required in the chain is done in house.\n\n1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:27.840\n Well, so you have a problem right now,\n\n1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:31.740\n and this is one of my concerns.\n\n1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:33.800\n I really would like to see somebody deal with this.\n\n1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:35.280\n If anyone out there is doing it,\n\n1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:38.000\n I'd like to help them if I can.\n\n1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:40.620\n You basically have two options right now to train.\n\n1:28:40.620 --> 1:28:43.840\n One, your options are NVIDIA or Google.\n\n1:28:45.980 --> 1:28:48.780\n So Google is not even an option.\n\n1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:53.180\n Their TPUs are only available in Google Cloud.\n\n1:28:53.180 --> 1:28:55.140\n Google has absolutely onerous\n\n1:28:55.140 --> 1:28:56.780\n terms of service restrictions.\n\n1:28:58.060 --> 1:28:59.280\n They may have changed it,\n\n1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:00.620\n but back in Google's terms of service,\n\n1:29:00.620 --> 1:29:03.740\n it said explicitly you are not allowed to use Google Cloud ML\n\n1:29:03.740 --> 1:29:05.340\n for training autonomous vehicles\n\n1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:07.360\n or for doing anything that competes with Google\n\n1:29:07.360 --> 1:29:09.300\n without Google's prior written permission.\n\n1:29:09.300 --> 1:29:10.340\n Wow, okay.\n\n1:29:10.340 --> 1:29:12.440\n I mean, Google is not a platform company.\n\n1:29:14.140 --> 1:29:16.760\n I wouldn't touch TPUs with a 10 foot pole.\n\n1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:19.300\n So that leaves you with the monopoly.\n\n1:29:19.300 --> 1:29:21.020\n NVIDIA? NVIDIA.\n\n1:29:21.020 --> 1:29:22.340\n So, I mean.\n\n1:29:22.340 --> 1:29:23.900\n That you're not a fan of.\n\n1:29:23.900 --> 1:29:28.540\n Well, look, I was a huge fan of in 2016 NVIDIA.\n\n1:29:28.540 --> 1:29:30.000\n Jensen came sat in the car.\n\n1:29:31.880 --> 1:29:32.820\n Cool guy.\n\n1:29:32.820 --> 1:29:34.640\n When the stock was $30 a share.\n\n1:29:35.540 --> 1:29:37.340\n NVIDIA stock has skyrocketed.\n\n1:29:38.220 --> 1:29:39.920\n I witnessed a real change\n\n1:29:39.920 --> 1:29:43.580\n in who was in management over there in like 2018.\n\n1:29:43.580 --> 1:29:46.700\n And now they are, let's exploit.\n\n1:29:46.700 --> 1:29:48.460\n Let's take every dollar we possibly can\n\n1:29:48.460 --> 1:29:49.580\n out of this ecosystem.\n\n1:29:49.580 --> 1:29:51.740\n Let's charge $10,000 for A100s\n\n1:29:51.740 --> 1:29:54.180\n because we know we got the best shit in the game.\n\n1:29:54.180 --> 1:29:57.920\n And let's charge $10,000 for an A100\n\n1:29:57.920 --> 1:30:00.100\n when it's really not that different from a 3080,\n\n1:30:00.100 --> 1:30:01.480\n which is 699.\n\n1:30:03.500 --> 1:30:05.100\n The margins that they are making\n\n1:30:05.100 --> 1:30:08.640\n off of those high end chips are so high\n\n1:30:08.640 --> 1:30:10.260\n that, I mean, I think they're shooting themselves\n\n1:30:10.260 --> 1:30:12.220\n in the foot just from a business perspective.\n\n1:30:12.220 --> 1:30:14.980\n Because there's a lot of people talking like me now\n\n1:30:14.980 --> 1:30:17.380\n who are like, somebody's gotta take NVIDIA down.\n\n1:30:19.060 --> 1:30:19.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:19.900 --> 1:30:21.020\n Where they could dominate it.\n\n1:30:21.020 --> 1:30:22.460\n NVIDIA could be the new Intel.\n\n1:30:22.460 --> 1:30:26.940\n Yeah, to be inside everything essentially.\n\n1:30:26.940 --> 1:30:30.660\n And yet the winners in certain spaces\n\n1:30:30.660 --> 1:30:33.780\n like autonomous driving, the winners,\n\n1:30:33.780 --> 1:30:36.620\n only the people who are like desperately falling back\n\n1:30:36.620 --> 1:30:38.540\n and trying to catch up and have a ton of money,\n\n1:30:38.540 --> 1:30:40.660\n like the big automakers are the ones\n\n1:30:40.660 --> 1:30:43.220\n interested in partnering with NVIDIA.\n\n1:30:43.220 --> 1:30:44.820\n Oh, and I think a lot of those things\n\n1:30:44.820 --> 1:30:45.940\n are gonna fall through.\n\n1:30:45.940 --> 1:30:49.340\n If I were NVIDIA, sell chips.\n\n1:30:49.340 --> 1:30:52.260\n Sell chips at a reasonable markup.\n\n1:30:52.260 --> 1:30:53.100\n To everybody.\n\n1:30:53.100 --> 1:30:53.920\n To everybody.\n\n1:30:53.920 --> 1:30:54.940\n Without any restrictions.\n\n1:30:54.940 --> 1:30:56.140\n Without any restrictions.\n\n1:30:56.140 --> 1:30:57.360\n Intel did this.\n\n1:30:57.360 --> 1:30:58.260\n Look at Intel.\n\n1:30:58.260 --> 1:30:59.940\n They had a great long run.\n\n1:30:59.940 --> 1:31:01.580\n NVIDIA is trying to turn their,\n\n1:31:01.580 --> 1:31:04.020\n they're like trying to productize their chips\n\n1:31:04.020 --> 1:31:05.620\n way too much.\n\n1:31:05.620 --> 1:31:07.880\n They're trying to extract way more value\n\n1:31:07.880 --> 1:31:09.380\n than they can sustainably.\n\n1:31:09.380 --> 1:31:10.740\n Sure, you can do it tomorrow.\n\n1:31:10.740 --> 1:31:12.140\n Is it gonna up your share price?\n\n1:31:12.140 --> 1:31:13.540\n Sure, if you're one of those CEOs\n\n1:31:13.540 --> 1:31:15.300\n who's like, how much can I strip mine this company?\n\n1:31:15.300 --> 1:31:17.860\n And I think, you know, and that's what's weird about it too.\n\n1:31:17.860 --> 1:31:19.380\n Like the CEO is the founder.\n\n1:31:19.380 --> 1:31:20.300\n It's the same guy.\n\n1:31:20.300 --> 1:31:21.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:21.120 --> 1:31:22.340\n I mean, I still think Jensen's a great guy.\n\n1:31:22.340 --> 1:31:23.300\n He is great.\n\n1:31:23.300 --> 1:31:25.180\n Why do this?\n\n1:31:25.180 --> 1:31:26.660\n You have a choice.\n\n1:31:26.660 --> 1:31:27.940\n You have a choice right now.\n\n1:31:27.940 --> 1:31:28.820\n Are you trying to cash out?\n\n1:31:28.820 --> 1:31:30.660\n Are you trying to buy a yacht?\n\n1:31:30.660 --> 1:31:32.100\n If you are, fine.\n\n1:31:32.100 --> 1:31:34.220\n But if you're trying to be\n\n1:31:34.220 --> 1:31:37.240\n the next huge semiconductor company, sell chips.\n\n1:31:37.240 --> 1:31:40.140\n Well, the interesting thing about Jensen\n\n1:31:40.140 --> 1:31:42.060\n is he is a big vision guy.\n\n1:31:42.060 --> 1:31:47.060\n So he has a plan like for 50 years down the road.\n\n1:31:48.700 --> 1:31:50.500\n So it makes me wonder like.\n\n1:31:50.500 --> 1:31:51.780\n How does price gouging fit into it?\n\n1:31:51.780 --> 1:31:54.000\n Yeah, how does that, like it's,\n\n1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:57.060\n it doesn't seem to make sense as a plan.\n\n1:31:57.060 --> 1:31:59.260\n I worry that he's listening to the wrong people.\n\n1:31:59.260 --> 1:32:02.540\n Yeah, that's the sense I have too sometimes.\n\n1:32:02.540 --> 1:32:07.540\n Because I, despite everything, I think NVIDIA\n\n1:32:07.940 --> 1:32:09.020\n is an incredible company.\n\n1:32:09.020 --> 1:32:12.420\n Well, one, so I'm deeply grateful to NVIDIA\n\n1:32:12.420 --> 1:32:13.740\n for the products they've created in the past.\n\n1:32:13.740 --> 1:32:14.580\n Me too.\n\n1:32:14.580 --> 1:32:15.400\n Right?\n\n1:32:15.400 --> 1:32:16.240\n And so.\n\n1:32:16.240 --> 1:32:18.000\n The 1080 Ti was a great GPU.\n\n1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:18.840\n Still have a lot of them.\n\n1:32:18.840 --> 1:32:20.160\n Still is, yeah.\n\n1:32:21.840 --> 1:32:24.540\n But at the same time, it just feels like,\n\n1:32:26.860 --> 1:32:29.380\n feels like you don't want to put all your stock in NVIDIA.\n\n1:32:29.380 --> 1:32:32.940\n And so like Elon is doing, what Tesla is doing\n\n1:32:32.940 --> 1:32:37.260\n with Autopilot and Dojo is the Apple way is,\n\n1:32:37.260 --> 1:32:40.300\n because they're not going to share Dojo with George Hott's.\n\n1:32:40.300 --> 1:32:42.340\n I know.\n\n1:32:42.340 --> 1:32:43.780\n They should sell that chip.\n\n1:32:43.780 --> 1:32:44.700\n Oh, they should sell that.\n\n1:32:44.700 --> 1:32:46.400\n Even their accelerator.\n\n1:32:46.400 --> 1:32:49.060\n The accelerator that's in all the cars, the 30 watt one.\n\n1:32:49.060 --> 1:32:50.600\n Sell it, why not?\n\n1:32:51.580 --> 1:32:52.700\n So open it up.\n\n1:32:52.700 --> 1:32:55.820\n Like make, why does Tesla have to be a car company?\n\n1:32:55.820 --> 1:32:58.060\n Well, if you sell the chip, here's what you get.\n\n1:32:58.060 --> 1:32:59.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:59.020 --> 1:33:00.260\n Make some money off the chips.\n\n1:33:00.260 --> 1:33:02.080\n It doesn't take away from your chip.\n\n1:33:02.080 --> 1:33:03.860\n You're going to make some money, free money.\n\n1:33:03.860 --> 1:33:07.380\n And also the world is going to build an ecosystem\n\n1:33:07.380 --> 1:33:09.020\n of tooling for you.\n\n1:33:09.020 --> 1:33:09.860\n Right?\n\n1:33:09.860 --> 1:33:12.860\n You're not going to have to fix the bug in your 10H layer.\n\n1:33:12.860 --> 1:33:14.100\n Someone else already did.\n\n1:33:15.140 --> 1:33:16.780\n Well, the question, that's an interesting question.\n\n1:33:16.780 --> 1:33:18.740\n I mean, that's the question Steve Jobs asked.\n\n1:33:18.740 --> 1:33:23.620\n That's the question Elon Musk is perhaps asking is,\n\n1:33:24.940 --> 1:33:28.060\n do you want Tesla stuff inside other vehicles?\n\n1:33:28.060 --> 1:33:32.620\n Inside, potentially inside like a iRobot vacuum cleaner.\n\n1:33:32.620 --> 1:33:33.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:34.860 --> 1:33:37.160\n I think you should decide where your advantages are.\n\n1:33:37.160 --> 1:33:39.260\n I'm not saying Tesla should start selling battery packs\n\n1:33:39.260 --> 1:33:40.380\n to automakers.\n\n1:33:40.380 --> 1:33:41.720\n Because battery packs to automakers,\n\n1:33:41.720 --> 1:33:43.660\n they are straight up in competition with you.\n\n1:33:43.660 --> 1:33:46.060\n If I were Tesla, I'd keep the battery technology totally.\n\n1:33:46.060 --> 1:33:46.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:46.900 --> 1:33:47.940\n As far as we make batteries.\n\n1:33:47.940 --> 1:33:52.940\n But the thing about the Tesla TPU is anybody can build that.\n\n1:33:53.160 --> 1:33:54.600\n It's just a question of, you know,\n\n1:33:54.600 --> 1:33:57.460\n are you willing to spend the money?\n\n1:33:57.460 --> 1:34:00.220\n It could be a huge source of revenue potentially.\n\n1:34:00.220 --> 1:34:02.420\n Are you willing to spend a hundred million dollars?\n\n1:34:02.420 --> 1:34:03.660\n Anyone can build it.\n\n1:34:03.660 --> 1:34:04.680\n And someone will.\n\n1:34:04.680 --> 1:34:06.680\n And a bunch of companies now are starting\n\n1:34:06.680 --> 1:34:08.020\n trying to build AI accelerators.\n\n1:34:08.020 --> 1:34:10.200\n Somebody is going to get the idea right.\n\n1:34:10.200 --> 1:34:13.700\n And yeah, hopefully they don't get greedy\n\n1:34:13.700 --> 1:34:15.780\n because they'll just lose to the next guy who finally,\n\n1:34:15.780 --> 1:34:17.540\n and then eventually the Chinese are going to make knockoff\n\n1:34:17.540 --> 1:34:19.580\n and video chips and that's.\n\n1:34:19.580 --> 1:34:20.400\n From your perspective,\n\n1:34:20.400 --> 1:34:21.820\n I don't know if you're also paying attention\n\n1:34:21.820 --> 1:34:24.180\n to stay on Tesla for a moment.\n\n1:34:24.180 --> 1:34:27.860\n Dave, Elon Musk has talked about a complete rewrite\n\n1:34:28.820 --> 1:34:31.700\n of the neural net that they're using.\n\n1:34:31.700 --> 1:34:34.800\n That seems to, again, I'm half paying attention,\n\n1:34:34.800 --> 1:34:39.000\n but it seems to involve basically a kind of integration\n\n1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:44.000\n of all the sensors to where it's a four dimensional view.\n\n1:34:44.180 --> 1:34:47.540\n You know, you have a 3D model of the world over time.\n\n1:34:47.540 --> 1:34:51.260\n And then you can, I think it's done both for the,\n\n1:34:52.100 --> 1:34:53.280\n for the actually, you know,\n\n1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:55.260\n so the neural network is able to,\n\n1:34:55.260 --> 1:34:56.920\n in a more holistic way,\n\n1:34:56.920 --> 1:34:59.340\n deal with the world and make predictions and so on,\n\n1:34:59.340 --> 1:35:04.340\n but also to make the annotation task more, you know, easier.\n\n1:35:04.780 --> 1:35:08.180\n Like you can annotate the world in one place\n\n1:35:08.180 --> 1:35:10.500\n and then kind of distribute itself across the sensors\n\n1:35:10.500 --> 1:35:12.860\n and across a different,\n\n1:35:12.860 --> 1:35:15.180\n like the hundreds of tasks that are involved\n\n1:35:15.180 --> 1:35:16.540\n in the Hydro Net.\n\n1:35:16.540 --> 1:35:19.140\n What are your thoughts about this rewrite?\n\n1:35:19.140 --> 1:35:22.420\n Is it just like some details that are kind of obvious\n\n1:35:22.420 --> 1:35:24.060\n that are steps that should be taken,\n\n1:35:24.060 --> 1:35:26.100\n or is there something fundamental\n\n1:35:26.100 --> 1:35:27.560\n that could challenge your idea\n\n1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:31.120\n that end to end is the right solution?\n\n1:35:31.120 --> 1:35:33.160\n We're in the middle of a big rewrite now as well.\n\n1:35:33.160 --> 1:35:34.860\n We haven't shipped a new model in a bit.\n\n1:35:34.860 --> 1:35:36.400\n Of what kind?\n\n1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:38.240\n We're going from 2D to 3D.\n\n1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:39.740\n Right now, all our stuff, like for example,\n\n1:35:39.740 --> 1:35:40.980\n when the car pitches back,\n\n1:35:40.980 --> 1:35:43.020\n the lane lines also pitch back\n\n1:35:43.020 --> 1:35:47.160\n because we're assuming the flat world hypothesis.\n\n1:35:47.160 --> 1:35:48.420\n The new models do not do this.\n\n1:35:48.420 --> 1:35:50.420\n The new models output everything in 3D.\n\n1:35:50.420 --> 1:35:53.580\n But there's still no annotation.\n\n1:35:53.580 --> 1:35:56.500\n So the 3D is, it's more about the output.\n\n1:35:56.500 --> 1:35:57.340\n Yeah.\n\n1:35:57.340 --> 1:36:00.100\n We have Zs in everything.\n\n1:36:00.100 --> 1:36:00.940\n We've...\n\n1:36:00.940 --> 1:36:01.760\n Zs.\n\n1:36:01.760 --> 1:36:02.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:36:02.600 --> 1:36:03.420\n We had a Zs.\n\n1:36:03.420 --> 1:36:04.260\n We had a Zs.\n\n1:36:04.260 --> 1:36:06.620\n We unified a lot of stuff as well.\n\n1:36:06.620 --> 1:36:08.900\n We switched from TensorFlow to PyTorch.\n\n1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:13.740\n My understanding of what Tesla's thing is,\n\n1:36:13.740 --> 1:36:15.660\n is that their annotator now annotates\n\n1:36:15.660 --> 1:36:16.960\n across the time dimension.\n\n1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:17.800\n Mm hmm.\n\n1:36:19.980 --> 1:36:22.000\n I mean, cute.\n\n1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.400\n Why are you building an annotator?\n\n1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:26.720\n I find their entire pipeline.\n\n1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:30.560\n I find your vision, I mean,\n\n1:36:30.560 --> 1:36:32.860\n the vision of end to end very compelling,\n\n1:36:32.860 --> 1:36:35.880\n but I also like the engineering of the data engine\n\n1:36:35.880 --> 1:36:37.400\n that they've created.\n\n1:36:37.400 --> 1:36:41.560\n In terms of supervised learning pipelines,\n\n1:36:41.560 --> 1:36:43.560\n that thing is damn impressive.\n\n1:36:43.560 --> 1:36:47.480\n You're basically, the idea is that you have\n\n1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:49.280\n hundreds of thousands of people\n\n1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:51.200\n that are doing data collection for you\n\n1:36:51.200 --> 1:36:52.400\n by doing their experience.\n\n1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:55.220\n So that's kind of similar to the Comma AI model.\n\n1:36:55.220 --> 1:36:59.580\n And you're able to mine that data\n\n1:36:59.580 --> 1:37:01.980\n based on the kind of edge cases you need.\n\n1:37:02.940 --> 1:37:07.360\n I think it's harder to do in the end to end learning.\n\n1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:09.520\n The mining of the right edge cases.\n\n1:37:09.520 --> 1:37:11.440\n Like that's where feature engineering\n\n1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:14.120\n is actually really powerful\n\n1:37:14.120 --> 1:37:17.280\n because like us humans are able to do\n\n1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:19.800\n this kind of mining a little better.\n\n1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:21.980\n But yeah, there's obvious, as we know,\n\n1:37:21.980 --> 1:37:24.840\n there's obvious constraints and limitations to that idea.\n\n1:37:25.880 --> 1:37:28.280\n Carpathia just tweeted, he's like,\n\n1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:29.640\n you get really interesting insights\n\n1:37:29.640 --> 1:37:32.800\n if you sort your validation set by loss\n\n1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:36.400\n and look at the highest loss examples.\n\n1:37:36.400 --> 1:37:37.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:39.180\n So yeah, I mean, you can do,\n\n1:37:39.180 --> 1:37:42.040\n we have a little data engine like thing.\n\n1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:43.560\n We're training a segment.\n\n1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:44.560\n I know it's not fancy.\n\n1:37:44.560 --> 1:37:48.280\n It's just like, okay, train the new segment,\n\n1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:50.080\n run it on 100,000 images\n\n1:37:50.080 --> 1:37:52.160\n and now take the thousand with highest loss.\n\n1:37:52.160 --> 1:37:54.160\n Select a hundred of those by human,\n\n1:37:54.160 --> 1:37:57.840\n put those, get those ones labeled, retrain, do it again.\n\n1:37:57.840 --> 1:38:01.480\n And so it's a much less well written data engine.\n\n1:38:01.480 --> 1:38:03.600\n And yeah, you can take these things really far\n\n1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:06.600\n and it is impressive engineering.\n\n1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:09.920\n And if you truly need supervised data for a problem,\n\n1:38:09.920 --> 1:38:12.560\n yeah, things like data engine are at the high end\n\n1:38:12.560 --> 1:38:14.960\n of what is attention?\n\n1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:15.960\n Is a human paying attention?\n\n1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:17.960\n I mean, we're going to probably build something\n\n1:38:17.960 --> 1:38:18.940\n that looks like data engine\n\n1:38:18.940 --> 1:38:21.120\n to push our driver monitoring further.\n\n1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:22.920\n But for driving itself,\n\n1:38:22.920 --> 1:38:26.400\n you have it all annotated beautifully by what the human does.\n\n1:38:26.400 --> 1:38:27.240\n Yeah, that's interesting.\n\n1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:30.040\n I mean, that applies to driver attention as well.\n\n1:38:30.040 --> 1:38:31.200\n Do you want to detect the eyes?\n\n1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:33.500\n Do you want to detect blinking and pupil movement?\n\n1:38:33.500 --> 1:38:36.680\n Do you want to detect all the like face alignments\n\n1:38:36.680 --> 1:38:38.720\n or landmark detection and so on,\n\n1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:41.560\n and then doing kind of reasoning based on that?\n\n1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:43.880\n Or do you want to take the entirety of the face over time\n\n1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:45.320\n and do end to end?\n\n1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:48.480\n I mean, it's obvious that eventually you have to do end\n\n1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:51.360\n to end with some calibration, some fixes and so on,\n\n1:38:51.360 --> 1:38:55.760\n but it's like, I don't know when that's the right move.\n\n1:38:55.760 --> 1:38:58.420\n Even if it's end to end, there actually is,\n\n1:38:58.420 --> 1:39:03.380\n there is no kind of, you have to supervise that with humans.\n\n1:39:03.380 --> 1:39:05.480\n Whether a human is paying attention or not\n\n1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:07.320\n is a completely subjective judgment.\n\n1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:11.040\n Like you can try to like automatically do it\n\n1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:13.160\n with some stuff, but you don't have,\n\n1:39:13.160 --> 1:39:15.080\n if I record a video of a human,\n\n1:39:15.080 --> 1:39:18.400\n I don't have true annotations anywhere in that video.\n\n1:39:18.400 --> 1:39:21.120\n The only way to get them is with,\n\n1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:22.840\n you know, other humans labeling it really.\n\n1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:23.860\n Well, I don't know.\n\n1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:28.540\n If you think deeply about it,\n\n1:39:28.540 --> 1:39:30.160\n you could, you might be able to just,\n\n1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:31.000\n depending on the task,\n\n1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:34.320\n maybe a discover self annotating things like,\n\n1:39:34.320 --> 1:39:36.920\n you know, you can look at like steering wheel reverse\n\n1:39:36.920 --> 1:39:37.760\n or something like that.\n\n1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:41.200\n You can discover little moments of lapse of attention.\n\n1:39:41.200 --> 1:39:44.540\n I mean, that's where psychology comes in.\n\n1:39:44.540 --> 1:39:45.480\n Is there indicate,\n\n1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:48.000\n cause you have so much data to look at.\n\n1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:51.140\n So you might be able to find moments when there's like,\n\n1:39:51.140 --> 1:39:54.320\n just inattention that even with smartphone,\n\n1:39:54.320 --> 1:39:56.700\n if you want to detect smartphone use,\n\n1:39:56.700 --> 1:39:57.880\n you can start to zoom in.\n\n1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:01.480\n I mean, that's the gold mine, sort of the comma AI.\n\n1:40:01.480 --> 1:40:02.920\n I mean, Tesla is doing this too, right?\n\n1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:06.920\n Is they're doing annotation based on,\n\n1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:10.500\n it's like a self supervised learning too.\n\n1:40:10.500 --> 1:40:13.440\n It's just a small part of the entire picture.\n\n1:40:13.440 --> 1:40:17.760\n That's kind of the challenge of solving a problem\n\n1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:18.660\n in machine learning.\n\n1:40:18.660 --> 1:40:23.660\n If you can discover self annotating parts of the problem,\n\n1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:25.020\n right?\n\n1:40:25.020 --> 1:40:27.760\n Our driver monitoring team is half a person right now.\n\n1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:29.280\n I would, you know, once we have,\n\n1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:33.280\n once we have two, three people on that team,\n\n1:40:33.280 --> 1:40:35.280\n I definitely want to look at self annotating stuff\n\n1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:36.600\n for attention.\n\n1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:43.200\n Let's go back for a sec to a comma and what,\n\n1:40:43.720 --> 1:40:46.240\n you know, for people who are curious to try it out,\n\n1:40:46.240 --> 1:40:51.120\n how do you install a comma in say a 2020 Toyota Corolla\n\n1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:53.400\n or like, what are the cars that are supported?\n\n1:40:53.400 --> 1:40:55.500\n What are the cars that you recommend?\n\n1:40:55.500 --> 1:40:57.880\n And what does it take?\n\n1:40:57.880 --> 1:41:00.000\n You have a few videos out, but maybe through words,\n\n1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:02.880\n can you explain what's it take to actually install a thing?\n\n1:41:02.880 --> 1:41:06.620\n So we support, I think it's 91 cars, 91 makes the models.\n\n1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:10.160\n We've got to 100 this year.\n\n1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:11.000\n Nice.\n\n1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:16.000\n The, yeah, the 2020 Corolla, great choice.\n\n1:41:16.680 --> 1:41:21.200\n The 2020 Sonata, it's using the stock longitudinal.\n\n1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:23.280\n It's using just our lateral control,\n\n1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:25.140\n but it's a very refined car.\n\n1:41:25.140 --> 1:41:28.200\n Their longitudinal control is not bad at all.\n\n1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:31.720\n So yeah, Corolla, Sonata,\n\n1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:34.240\n or if you're willing to get your hands a little dirty\n\n1:41:34.240 --> 1:41:35.940\n and look in the right places on the internet,\n\n1:41:35.940 --> 1:41:37.520\n the Honda Civic is great,\n\n1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:40.600\n but you're going to have to install a modified EPS firmware\n\n1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:42.160\n in order to get a little bit more torque.\n\n1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:43.380\n And I can't help you with that.\n\n1:41:43.380 --> 1:41:45.960\n Comma does not officially endorse that,\n\n1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:47.560\n but we have been doing it.\n\n1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:49.800\n We didn't ever release it.\n\n1:41:49.800 --> 1:41:51.440\n We waited for someone else to discover it.\n\n1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:52.880\n And then, you know.\n\n1:41:52.880 --> 1:41:55.680\n And you have a Discord server where people,\n\n1:41:55.680 --> 1:42:00.360\n there's a very active developer community, I suppose.\n\n1:42:00.360 --> 1:42:04.000\n So depending on the level of experimentation\n\n1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:07.600\n you're willing to do, that's the community.\n\n1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:11.240\n If you just want to buy it and you have a supported car,\n\n1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:13.920\n it's 10 minutes to install.\n\n1:42:13.920 --> 1:42:15.400\n There's YouTube videos.\n\n1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:17.040\n It's Ikea furniture level.\n\n1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:19.040\n If you can set up a table from Ikea,\n\n1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:21.200\n you can install a Comma 2 in your supported car\n\n1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:22.600\n and it will just work.\n\n1:42:22.600 --> 1:42:24.920\n Now you're like, oh, but I want this high end feature\n\n1:42:24.920 --> 1:42:26.160\n or I want to fix this bug.\n\n1:42:26.160 --> 1:42:28.520\n Okay, well, welcome to the developer community.\n\n1:42:29.520 --> 1:42:31.000\n So what, if I wanted to,\n\n1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:34.680\n this is something I asked you offline like a few months ago.\n\n1:42:34.680 --> 1:42:38.800\n If I wanted to run my own code to,\n\n1:42:39.800 --> 1:42:43.420\n so use Comma as a platform\n\n1:42:43.420 --> 1:42:46.040\n and try to run something like OpenPilot,\n\n1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:48.320\n what does it take to do that?\n\n1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:51.840\n So there's a toggle in the settings called enable SSH.\n\n1:42:51.840 --> 1:42:54.600\n And if you toggle that, you can SSH into your device.\n\n1:42:54.600 --> 1:42:55.620\n You can modify the code.\n\n1:42:55.620 --> 1:42:58.260\n You can upload whatever code you want to it.\n\n1:42:58.260 --> 1:42:59.160\n There's a whole lot of people.\n\n1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:03.040\n So about 60% of people are running stock comma.\n\n1:43:03.040 --> 1:43:05.480\n About 40% of people are running forks.\n\n1:43:05.480 --> 1:43:07.280\n And there's a community of,\n\n1:43:07.280 --> 1:43:10.320\n there's a bunch of people who maintain these forks\n\n1:43:10.320 --> 1:43:13.040\n and these forks support different cars\n\n1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:15.700\n or they have different toggles.\n\n1:43:15.700 --> 1:43:17.360\n We try to keep away from the toggles\n\n1:43:17.360 --> 1:43:18.920\n that are like disabled driver monitoring,\n\n1:43:18.920 --> 1:43:21.720\n but there's some people might want that kind of thing\n\n1:43:21.720 --> 1:43:24.560\n and like, yeah, you can, it's your car.\n\n1:43:24.560 --> 1:43:26.620\n I'm not here to tell you.\n\n1:43:29.400 --> 1:43:31.080\n We have some, we ban,\n\n1:43:31.080 --> 1:43:32.920\n if you're trying to subvert safety features,\n\n1:43:32.920 --> 1:43:33.760\n you're banned from our Discord.\n\n1:43:33.760 --> 1:43:35.260\n I don't want anything to do with you,\n\n1:43:35.260 --> 1:43:36.920\n but there's some forks doing that.\n\n1:43:37.920 --> 1:43:38.760\n Got it.\n\n1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:42.880\n So you encourage responsible forking.\n\n1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:43.720\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:43:43.720 --> 1:43:46.080\n We encourage, some people, yeah, some people,\n\n1:43:46.080 --> 1:43:48.160\n like there's forks that will do,\n\n1:43:48.160 --> 1:43:52.040\n some people just like having a lot of readouts on the UI,\n\n1:43:52.040 --> 1:43:53.440\n like a lot of like flashing numbers.\n\n1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:55.120\n So there's forks that do that.\n\n1:43:55.120 --> 1:43:57.200\n Some people don't like the fact that it disengages\n\n1:43:57.200 --> 1:43:58.320\n when you press the gas pedal.\n\n1:43:58.320 --> 1:44:00.480\n There's forks that disable that.\n\n1:44:00.480 --> 1:44:01.320\n Got it.\n\n1:44:01.320 --> 1:44:04.920\n Now the stock experience is what like,\n\n1:44:04.920 --> 1:44:06.240\n so it does both lane keeping\n\n1:44:06.240 --> 1:44:08.960\n and longitudinal control all together.\n\n1:44:08.960 --> 1:44:11.020\n So it's not separate like it is in autopilot.\n\n1:44:11.020 --> 1:44:12.520\n No, so, okay.\n\n1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:15.040\n Some cars we use the stock longitudinal control.\n\n1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:17.400\n We don't do the longitudinal control in all the cars.\n\n1:44:17.400 --> 1:44:19.560\n Some cars, the ACCs are pretty good in the cars.\n\n1:44:19.560 --> 1:44:21.360\n It's the lane keep that's atrocious in anything\n\n1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:23.420\n except for autopilot and super cruise.\n\n1:44:23.420 --> 1:44:27.880\n But, you know, you just turn it on and it works.\n\n1:44:27.880 --> 1:44:29.480\n What does this engagement look like?\n\n1:44:29.480 --> 1:44:30.960\n Yeah, so we have, I mean,\n\n1:44:30.960 --> 1:44:32.960\n I'm very concerned about mode confusion.\n\n1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:36.960\n I've experienced it on super cruise and autopilot\n\n1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:39.820\n where like autopilot, like autopilot disengages.\n\n1:44:39.820 --> 1:44:42.400\n I don't realize that the ACC is still on.\n\n1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:44.680\n The lead car moves slightly over\n\n1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:46.160\n and then the Tesla accelerates\n\n1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:48.000\n to like whatever my set speed is super fast.\n\n1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:49.840\n I'm like, what's going on here?\n\n1:44:51.320 --> 1:44:53.720\n We have engaged and disengaged.\n\n1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:56.380\n And this is similar to my understanding, I'm not a pilot,\n\n1:44:56.380 --> 1:45:00.080\n but my understanding is either the pilot is in control\n\n1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:02.080\n or the copilot is in control.\n\n1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:05.120\n And we have the same kind of transition system.\n\n1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:08.620\n Either open pilot is engaged or open pilot is disengaged.\n\n1:45:08.620 --> 1:45:10.160\n Engage with cruise control,\n\n1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:13.320\n disengage with either gas brake or cancel.\n\n1:45:13.320 --> 1:45:14.560\n Let's talk about money.\n\n1:45:14.560 --> 1:45:17.360\n What's the business strategy for Kama?\n\n1:45:17.360 --> 1:45:18.840\n Profitable.\n\n1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:19.680\n Well, so you're.\n\n1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:20.520\n We did it.\n\n1:45:20.520 --> 1:45:23.200\n So congratulations.\n\n1:45:23.200 --> 1:45:25.760\n What, so basically selling,\n\n1:45:25.760 --> 1:45:29.960\n so we should say Kama cost a thousand bucks, Kama two?\n\n1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:31.640\n 200 for the interface to the car as well.\n\n1:45:31.640 --> 1:45:33.000\n It's 1200, I'll send that.\n\n1:45:34.360 --> 1:45:36.400\n Nobody's usually upfront like this.\n\n1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:38.200\n Yeah, you gotta add the tack on, right?\n\n1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:39.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:39.040 --> 1:45:39.860\n I love it.\n\n1:45:39.860 --> 1:45:41.080\n I'm not gonna lie to you.\n\n1:45:41.080 --> 1:45:43.840\n Trust me, it will add $1,200 of value to your life.\n\n1:45:43.840 --> 1:45:45.560\n Yes, it's still super cheap.\n\n1:45:45.560 --> 1:45:47.880\n 30 days, no questions asked, money back guarantee,\n\n1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:50.400\n and prices are only going up.\n\n1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:52.320\n If there ever is future hardware,\n\n1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:53.840\n it could cost a lot more than $1,200.\n\n1:45:53.840 --> 1:45:55.400\n So Kama three is in the works.\n\n1:45:56.960 --> 1:45:57.800\n It could be.\n\n1:45:57.800 --> 1:45:59.640\n All I will say is future hardware\n\n1:45:59.640 --> 1:46:02.900\n is going to cost a lot more than the current hardware.\n\n1:46:02.900 --> 1:46:05.260\n Yeah, the people that use,\n\n1:46:05.260 --> 1:46:07.880\n the people I've spoken with that use Kama,\n\n1:46:07.880 --> 1:46:09.120\n that use open pilot,\n\n1:46:10.320 --> 1:46:12.120\n first of all, they use it a lot.\n\n1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:14.400\n So people that use it, they fall in love with it.\n\n1:46:14.400 --> 1:46:16.840\n Oh, our retention rate is insane.\n\n1:46:16.840 --> 1:46:17.740\n It's a good sign.\n\n1:46:17.740 --> 1:46:18.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:46:18.580 --> 1:46:19.680\n It's a really good sign.\n\n1:46:19.680 --> 1:46:23.720\n 70% of Kama two buyers are daily active users.\n\n1:46:23.720 --> 1:46:25.260\n Yeah, it's amazing.\n\n1:46:27.760 --> 1:46:30.520\n Oh, also, we don't plan on stopping selling the Kama two.\n\n1:46:30.520 --> 1:46:31.960\n Like it's, you know.\n\n1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:35.000\n So whatever you create that's beyond Kama two,\n\n1:46:36.600 --> 1:46:40.760\n it would be potentially a phase shift.\n\n1:46:40.760 --> 1:46:42.840\n Like it's so much better that,\n\n1:46:42.840 --> 1:46:44.200\n like you could use Kama two\n\n1:46:44.200 --> 1:46:45.760\n and you can use Kama whatever.\n\n1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:46.600\n Depends what you want.\n\n1:46:46.600 --> 1:46:48.320\n It's 3.41, 42.\n\n1:46:48.320 --> 1:46:49.160\n Yeah.\n\n1:46:49.160 --> 1:46:52.200\n You know, autopilot hardware one versus hardware two.\n\n1:46:52.200 --> 1:46:53.600\n The Kama two is kind of like hardware one.\n\n1:46:53.600 --> 1:46:54.440\n Got it, got it.\n\n1:46:54.440 --> 1:46:55.260\n You can still use both.\n\n1:46:55.260 --> 1:46:56.320\n Got it, got it.\n\n1:46:56.320 --> 1:46:58.000\n I think I heard you talk about retention rate\n\n1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:01.240\n with the VR headsets that the average is just once.\n\n1:47:01.240 --> 1:47:02.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:02.080 --> 1:47:02.900\n Just fast.\n\n1:47:02.900 --> 1:47:03.880\n I mean, it's such a fascinating way\n\n1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:05.760\n to think about technology.\n\n1:47:05.760 --> 1:47:07.420\n And this is a really, really good sign.\n\n1:47:07.420 --> 1:47:09.000\n And the other thing that people say about Kama\n\n1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:12.060\n is like they can't believe they're getting this 4,000 bucks.\n\n1:47:12.060 --> 1:47:12.900\n Right?\n\n1:47:12.900 --> 1:47:16.000\n It seems like some kind of steal.\n\n1:47:17.020 --> 1:47:20.040\n So, but in terms of like longterm business strategies\n\n1:47:20.040 --> 1:47:21.640\n that basically to put,\n\n1:47:21.640 --> 1:47:25.120\n so it's currently in like a thousand plus cars.\n\n1:47:27.560 --> 1:47:28.520\n 1,200.\n\n1:47:28.520 --> 1:47:29.360\n More, more.\n\n1:47:30.560 --> 1:47:35.560\n So yeah, dailies is about, dailies is about 2,000.\n\n1:47:35.560 --> 1:47:38.960\n Weeklys is about 2,500, monthlys is over 3,000.\n\n1:47:38.960 --> 1:47:39.800\n Wow.\n\n1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:42.120\n We've grown a lot since we last talked.\n\n1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:44.800\n Is the goal, like can we talk crazy for a second?\n\n1:47:44.800 --> 1:47:47.580\n I mean, what's the goal to overtake Tesla?\n\n1:47:48.620 --> 1:47:49.960\n Let's talk, okay, so.\n\n1:47:49.960 --> 1:47:51.480\n I mean, Android did overtake iOS.\n\n1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:52.520\n That's exactly it, right?\n\n1:47:52.520 --> 1:47:55.360\n So they did it.\n\n1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:57.720\n I actually don't know the timeline of that one.\n\n1:47:57.720 --> 1:48:02.160\n But let's talk, because everything is in alpha now.\n\n1:48:02.160 --> 1:48:03.960\n The autopilot you could argue is in alpha\n\n1:48:03.960 --> 1:48:05.840\n in terms of towards the big mission\n\n1:48:05.840 --> 1:48:07.680\n of autonomous driving, right?\n\n1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:11.600\n And so what, yeah, is your goal to overtake\n\n1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:13.920\n millions of cars essentially?\n\n1:48:13.920 --> 1:48:15.520\n Of course.\n\n1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:16.760\n Where would it stop?\n\n1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:18.000\n Like it's open source software.\n\n1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:19.280\n It might not be millions of cars\n\n1:48:19.280 --> 1:48:21.360\n with a piece of comma hardware, but yeah.\n\n1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:24.320\n I think open pilot at some point\n\n1:48:24.320 --> 1:48:26.920\n will cross over autopilot in users,\n\n1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:29.200\n just like Android crossed over iOS.\n\n1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:31.240\n How does Google make money from Android?\n\n1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:34.840\n It's complicated.\n\n1:48:34.840 --> 1:48:36.440\n Their own devices make money.\n\n1:48:37.400 --> 1:48:39.480\n Google, Google makes money\n\n1:48:39.480 --> 1:48:42.240\n by just kind of having you on the internet.\n\n1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:43.080\n Yes.\n\n1:48:43.080 --> 1:48:45.620\n Google search is built in, Gmail is built in.\n\n1:48:45.620 --> 1:48:46.540\n Android is just a shill\n\n1:48:46.540 --> 1:48:48.200\n for the rest of Google's ecosystem.\n\n1:48:48.200 --> 1:48:50.680\n Yeah, but the problem is Android is not,\n\n1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:52.440\n is a brilliant thing.\n\n1:48:52.440 --> 1:48:55.080\n I mean, Android arguably changed the world.\n\n1:48:55.080 --> 1:48:56.440\n So there you go.\n\n1:48:56.440 --> 1:49:00.800\n That's, you can feel good ethically speaking.\n\n1:49:00.800 --> 1:49:04.320\n But as a business strategy, it's questionable.\n\n1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:05.720\n Or sell hardware.\n\n1:49:05.720 --> 1:49:06.560\n Sell hardware.\n\n1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:08.120\n I mean, it took Google a long time to come around to it,\n\n1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:10.000\n but they are now making money on the Pixel.\n\n1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:13.240\n You're not about money, you're more about winning.\n\n1:49:13.240 --> 1:49:14.160\n Yeah, of course.\n\n1:49:14.160 --> 1:49:18.320\n No, but if only 10% of open pilot devices\n\n1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:19.920\n come from comma AI.\n\n1:49:19.920 --> 1:49:20.820\n They still make a lot.\n\n1:49:20.820 --> 1:49:21.660\n That is still, yes.\n\n1:49:21.660 --> 1:49:22.840\n That is a ton of money for our company.\n\n1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:27.120\n But can't somebody create a better comma using open pilot?\n\n1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:28.840\n Or are you basically saying, well, I'll compete them?\n\n1:49:28.840 --> 1:49:29.680\n Well, I'll compete you.\n\n1:49:29.680 --> 1:49:32.280\n Can you create a better Android phone than the Google Pixel?\n\n1:49:32.280 --> 1:49:32.800\n Right.\n\n1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:34.680\n I mean, you can, but like, you know.\n\n1:49:34.680 --> 1:49:35.520\n I love that.\n\n1:49:35.520 --> 1:49:37.360\n So you're confident, like, you know\n\n1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:38.480\n what the hell you're doing.\n\n1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:40.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:40.040 --> 1:49:43.520\n It's confidence and merit.\n\n1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:44.960\n I mean, our money comes from, we're\n\n1:49:44.960 --> 1:49:46.160\n a consumer electronics company.\n\n1:49:46.160 --> 1:49:46.660\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:46.660 --> 1:49:48.040\n And put it this way.\n\n1:49:48.040 --> 1:49:51.600\n So we sold like 3,000 comma twos.\n\n1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:54.080\n 2,500 right now.\n\n1:49:54.080 --> 1:49:59.720\n And like, OK, we're probably going\n\n1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:01.920\n to sell 10,000 units next year.\n\n1:50:01.920 --> 1:50:04.520\n 10,000 units, even just $1,000 a unit, OK,\n\n1:50:04.520 --> 1:50:09.400\n we're at 10 million in revenue.\n\n1:50:09.400 --> 1:50:12.100\n Get that up to 100,000, maybe double the price of the unit.\n\n1:50:12.100 --> 1:50:13.560\n Now we're talking like 200 million revenue.\n\n1:50:13.560 --> 1:50:14.440\n We're talking like series.\n\n1:50:14.440 --> 1:50:15.840\n Yeah, actually making money.\n\n1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:19.360\n One of the rare semi autonomous or autonomous vehicle companies\n\n1:50:19.360 --> 1:50:21.080\n that are actually making money.\n\n1:50:21.080 --> 1:50:22.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:24.880\n You know, if you look at a model,\n\n1:50:24.880 --> 1:50:26.680\n and we were just talking about this yesterday.\n\n1:50:26.680 --> 1:50:29.760\n If you look at a model, and like you're AB testing your model,\n\n1:50:29.760 --> 1:50:32.360\n and if you're one branch of the AB test,\n\n1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:35.320\n the losses go down very fast in the first five epochs.\n\n1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:37.520\n That model is probably going to converge\n\n1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:39.360\n to something considerably better than the one\n\n1:50:39.360 --> 1:50:41.360\n where the losses are going down slower.\n\n1:50:41.360 --> 1:50:43.000\n Why do people think this is going to stop?\n\n1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:44.500\n Why do people think one day there's\n\n1:50:44.500 --> 1:50:46.840\n going to be a great like, well, Waymo's eventually\n\n1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:49.600\n going to surpass you guys?\n\n1:50:49.600 --> 1:50:52.000\n Well, they're not.\n\n1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:55.800\n Do you see like a world where like a Tesla or a car\n\n1:50:55.800 --> 1:50:59.160\n like a Tesla would be able to basically press a button\n\n1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:01.920\n and you like switch to open pilot?\n\n1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:04.480\n You know, you load in.\n\n1:51:04.480 --> 1:51:06.840\n No, so I think so first off, I think\n\n1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:10.560\n that we may surpass Tesla in terms of users.\n\n1:51:10.560 --> 1:51:12.520\n I do not think we're going to surpass Tesla ever\n\n1:51:12.520 --> 1:51:13.520\n in terms of revenue.\n\n1:51:13.520 --> 1:51:16.380\n I think Tesla can capture a lot more revenue per user\n\n1:51:16.380 --> 1:51:17.320\n than we can.\n\n1:51:17.320 --> 1:51:20.520\n But this mimics the Android iOS model exactly.\n\n1:51:20.520 --> 1:51:22.000\n There may be more Android devices,\n\n1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.320\n but there's a lot more iPhones than Google Pixels.\n\n1:51:24.320 --> 1:51:26.360\n So I think there'll be a lot more Tesla cars sold\n\n1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:27.560\n than pieces of common hardware.\n\n1:51:30.280 --> 1:51:34.420\n And then as far as a Tesla owner being\n\n1:51:34.420 --> 1:51:40.920\n able to switch to open pilot, does iPhones run Android?\n\n1:51:40.920 --> 1:51:42.400\n No, but it doesn't make sense.\n\n1:51:42.400 --> 1:51:43.480\n You can if you really want to do it,\n\n1:51:43.480 --> 1:51:44.440\n but it doesn't really make sense.\n\n1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:45.320\n Like it's not.\n\n1:51:45.320 --> 1:51:46.240\n It doesn't make sense.\n\n1:51:46.240 --> 1:51:46.740\n Who cares?\n\n1:51:46.740 --> 1:51:51.640\n What about if a large company like automakers, Ford, GM,\n\n1:51:51.640 --> 1:51:53.720\n Toyota came to George Hots?\n\n1:51:53.720 --> 1:51:58.000\n Or on the tech space, Amazon, Facebook, Google\n\n1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:01.080\n came with a large pile of cash?\n\n1:52:01.080 --> 1:52:07.360\n Would you consider being purchased?\n\n1:52:07.360 --> 1:52:10.500\n Do you see that as a one possible?\n\n1:52:10.500 --> 1:52:12.360\n Not seriously, no.\n\n1:52:12.360 --> 1:52:19.680\n I would probably see how much shit they'll entertain for me.\n\n1:52:19.680 --> 1:52:22.080\n And if they're willing to jump through a bunch of my hoops,\n\n1:52:22.080 --> 1:52:22.960\n then maybe.\n\n1:52:22.960 --> 1:52:25.200\n But no, not the way that M&A works today.\n\n1:52:25.200 --> 1:52:26.520\n I mean, we've been approached.\n\n1:52:26.520 --> 1:52:28.000\n And I laugh in these people's faces.\n\n1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:31.000\n I'm like, are you kidding?\n\n1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:31.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:33.680\n Because it's so demeaning.\n\n1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:36.960\n The M&A people are so demeaning to companies.\n\n1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:41.340\n They treat the startup world as their innovation ecosystem.\n\n1:52:41.340 --> 1:52:43.640\n And they think that I'm cool with going along with that,\n\n1:52:43.640 --> 1:52:46.440\n so I can have some of their scam fake Fed dollars.\n\n1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:47.680\n Fed coin.\n\n1:52:47.680 --> 1:52:49.680\n What am I going to do with more Fed coin?\n\n1:52:49.680 --> 1:52:50.320\n Fed coin.\n\n1:52:50.320 --> 1:52:51.400\n Fed coin, man.\n\n1:52:51.400 --> 1:52:52.120\n I love that.\n\n1:52:52.120 --> 1:52:54.040\n So that's the cool thing about podcasting,\n\n1:52:54.040 --> 1:52:56.200\n actually, is people criticize.\n\n1:52:56.200 --> 1:53:00.560\n I don't know if you're familiar with Spotify giving Joe Rogan\n\n1:53:00.560 --> 1:53:01.920\n $100 million.\n\n1:53:01.920 --> 1:53:03.720\n I don't know about that.\n\n1:53:03.720 --> 1:53:08.200\n And they respect, despite all the shit\n\n1:53:08.200 --> 1:53:11.440\n that people are talking about Spotify,\n\n1:53:11.440 --> 1:53:15.300\n people understand that podcasters like Joe Rogan\n\n1:53:15.300 --> 1:53:17.200\n know what the hell they're doing.\n\n1:53:17.200 --> 1:53:21.160\n So they give them money and say, just do what you do.\n\n1:53:21.160 --> 1:53:25.440\n And the equivalent for you would be like,\n\n1:53:25.440 --> 1:53:28.440\n George, do what the hell you do, because you're good at it.\n\n1:53:28.440 --> 1:53:31.400\n Try not to murder too many people.\n\n1:53:31.400 --> 1:53:33.480\n There's some kind of common sense things,\n\n1:53:33.480 --> 1:53:37.400\n like just don't go on a weird rampage of it.\n\n1:53:37.400 --> 1:53:38.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:53:38.080 --> 1:53:43.400\n It comes down to what companies I could respect, right?\n\n1:53:43.400 --> 1:53:44.440\n Could I respect GM?\n\n1:53:44.440 --> 1:53:46.520\n Never.\n\n1:53:46.520 --> 1:53:47.480\n No, I couldn't.\n\n1:53:47.480 --> 1:53:50.840\n I mean, could I respect a Hyundai?\n\n1:53:50.840 --> 1:53:52.520\n More so.\n\n1:53:52.520 --> 1:53:53.560\n That's a lot closer.\n\n1:53:53.560 --> 1:53:54.720\n Toyota?\n\n1:53:54.720 --> 1:53:55.840\n What's your?\n\n1:53:55.840 --> 1:53:56.840\n Nah.\n\n1:53:56.840 --> 1:53:57.520\n Nah.\n\n1:53:57.520 --> 1:53:59.400\n Korean is the way.\n\n1:53:59.400 --> 1:54:02.440\n I think that the Japanese, the Germans, the US, they're all\n\n1:54:02.440 --> 1:54:05.720\n too, they're all too, they all think they're too great.\n\n1:54:05.720 --> 1:54:07.520\n What about the tech companies?\n\n1:54:07.520 --> 1:54:08.480\n Apple?\n\n1:54:08.480 --> 1:54:11.000\n Apple is, of the tech companies that I could respect,\n\n1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:12.120\n Apple's the closest.\n\n1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:12.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:54:12.600 --> 1:54:13.560\n I mean, I could never.\n\n1:54:13.560 --> 1:54:14.440\n It would be ironic.\n\n1:54:14.440 --> 1:54:19.840\n It would be ironic if Comma AI is acquired by Apple.\n\n1:54:19.840 --> 1:54:21.840\n I mean, Facebook, look, I quit Facebook 10 years ago\n\n1:54:21.840 --> 1:54:24.320\n because I didn't respect the business model.\n\n1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:28.480\n Google has declined so fast in the last five years.\n\n1:54:28.480 --> 1:54:32.080\n What are your thoughts about Waymo and its present\n\n1:54:32.080 --> 1:54:33.200\n and its future?\n\n1:54:33.200 --> 1:54:39.240\n Let me start by saying something nice, which is I've\n\n1:54:39.240 --> 1:54:45.240\n visited them a few times and have ridden in their cars.\n\n1:54:45.240 --> 1:54:49.760\n And the engineering that they're doing,\n\n1:54:49.760 --> 1:54:51.720\n both the research and the actual development\n\n1:54:51.720 --> 1:54:53.360\n and the engineering they're doing\n\n1:54:53.360 --> 1:54:55.160\n and the scale they're actually achieving\n\n1:54:55.160 --> 1:54:58.400\n by doing it all themselves is really impressive.\n\n1:54:58.400 --> 1:55:01.480\n And the balance of safety and innovation.\n\n1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:07.520\n And the cars work really well for the routes they drive.\n\n1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:10.960\n It drives fast, which was very surprising to me.\n\n1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:14.800\n It drives the speed limit or faster than the speed limit.\n\n1:55:14.800 --> 1:55:16.120\n It goes.\n\n1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:17.800\n And it works really damn well.\n\n1:55:17.800 --> 1:55:19.160\n And the interface is nice.\n\n1:55:19.160 --> 1:55:20.360\n In Chandler, Arizona, yeah.\n\n1:55:20.360 --> 1:55:22.560\n Yeah, in Chandler, Arizona, very specific environment.\n\n1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:27.360\n So it gives me enough material in my mind\n\n1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:30.360\n to push back against the madmen of the world,\n\n1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:36.040\n like George Hotz, to be like, because you kind of imply\n\n1:55:36.040 --> 1:55:38.760\n there's zero probability they're going to win.\n\n1:55:38.760 --> 1:55:43.560\n And after I've used, after I've ridden in it, to me,\n\n1:55:43.560 --> 1:55:44.440\n it's not zero.\n\n1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:46.760\n Oh, it's not for technology reasons.\n\n1:55:46.760 --> 1:55:48.000\n Bureaucracy?\n\n1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:49.520\n No, it's worse than that.\n\n1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:51.840\n It's actually for product reasons, I think.\n\n1:55:51.840 --> 1:55:53.840\n Oh, you think they're just not capable of creating\n\n1:55:53.840 --> 1:55:55.600\n an amazing product?\n\n1:55:55.600 --> 1:55:58.280\n No, I think that the product that they're building\n\n1:55:58.280 --> 1:56:01.040\n doesn't make sense.\n\n1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:03.320\n So a few things.\n\n1:56:03.320 --> 1:56:05.840\n You say the Waymo's are fast.\n\n1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:09.040\n Benchmark a Waymo against a competent Uber driver.\n\n1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:09.600\n Right.\n\n1:56:09.600 --> 1:56:10.080\n Right?\n\n1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:11.080\n The Uber driver's faster.\n\n1:56:11.080 --> 1:56:12.200\n It's not even about speed.\n\n1:56:12.200 --> 1:56:13.240\n It's the thing you said.\n\n1:56:13.240 --> 1:56:16.280\n It's about the experience of being stuck at a stop sign\n\n1:56:16.280 --> 1:56:20.120\n because pedestrians are crossing nonstop.\n\n1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:22.160\n I like when my Uber driver doesn't come to a full stop\n\n1:56:22.160 --> 1:56:22.960\n at the stop sign.\n\n1:56:22.960 --> 1:56:23.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:56:23.520 --> 1:56:24.440\n You know?\n\n1:56:24.440 --> 1:56:31.320\n And so let's say the Waymo's are 20% slower than an Uber.\n\n1:56:31.320 --> 1:56:33.000\n Right?\n\n1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.160\n You can argue that they're going to be cheaper.\n\n1:56:35.160 --> 1:56:37.640\n And I argue that users already have the choice\n\n1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:39.360\n to trade off money for speed.\n\n1:56:39.360 --> 1:56:42.280\n It's called UberPool.\n\n1:56:42.280 --> 1:56:45.560\n I think it's like 15% of rides are UberPools.\n\n1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:46.040\n Right?\n\n1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:49.480\n Users are not willing to trade off money for speed.\n\n1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:52.320\n So the whole product that they're building\n\n1:56:52.320 --> 1:56:56.200\n is not going to be competitive with traditional ride sharing\n\n1:56:56.200 --> 1:56:56.720\n networks.\n\n1:56:56.720 --> 1:56:59.560\n Right.\n\n1:56:59.560 --> 1:57:04.360\n And also, whether there's profit to be made\n\n1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:07.360\n depends entirely on one company having a monopoly.\n\n1:57:07.360 --> 1:57:11.200\n I think that the level four autonomous ride sharing\n\n1:57:11.200 --> 1:57:14.800\n vehicles market is going to look a lot like the scooter market\n\n1:57:14.800 --> 1:57:18.680\n if even the technology does come to exist, which I question.\n\n1:57:18.680 --> 1:57:20.400\n Who's doing well in that market?\n\n1:57:20.400 --> 1:57:22.320\n It's a race to the bottom.\n\n1:57:22.320 --> 1:57:25.680\n Well, it could be closer like an Uber and a Lyft,\n\n1:57:25.680 --> 1:57:28.000\n where it's just one or two players.\n\n1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:31.160\n Well, the scooter people have given up\n\n1:57:31.160 --> 1:57:34.760\n trying to market scooters as a practical means\n\n1:57:34.760 --> 1:57:35.480\n of transportation.\n\n1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:37.640\n And they're just like, they're super fun to ride.\n\n1:57:37.640 --> 1:57:38.360\n Look at wheels.\n\n1:57:38.360 --> 1:57:39.160\n I love those things.\n\n1:57:39.160 --> 1:57:40.560\n And they're great on that front.\n\n1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:41.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:57:41.040 --> 1:57:43.840\n But from an actual transportation product\n\n1:57:43.840 --> 1:57:46.240\n perspective, I do not think scooters are viable.\n\n1:57:46.240 --> 1:57:49.200\n And I do not think level four autonomous cars are viable.\n\n1:57:49.200 --> 1:57:51.560\n If you, let's play a fun experiment.\n\n1:57:51.560 --> 1:57:56.960\n If you ran, let's do a Tesla and let's do Waymo.\n\n1:57:56.960 --> 1:58:01.880\n If Elon Musk took a vacation for a year, he just said,\n\n1:58:01.880 --> 1:58:05.400\n screw it, I'm going to go live on an island, no electronics.\n\n1:58:05.400 --> 1:58:07.520\n And the board decides that we need to find somebody\n\n1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:09.160\n to run the company.\n\n1:58:09.160 --> 1:58:11.520\n And they did decide that you should run the company\n\n1:58:11.520 --> 1:58:12.240\n for a year.\n\n1:58:12.240 --> 1:58:14.920\n How do you run Tesla differently?\n\n1:58:14.920 --> 1:58:16.240\n I wouldn't change much.\n\n1:58:16.240 --> 1:58:17.920\n Do you think they're on the right track?\n\n1:58:17.920 --> 1:58:18.680\n I wouldn't change.\n\n1:58:18.680 --> 1:58:21.640\n I mean, I'd have some minor changes.\n\n1:58:21.640 --> 1:58:25.520\n But even my debate with Tesla about end\n\n1:58:25.520 --> 1:58:29.120\n to end versus SegNets, that's just software.\n\n1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:30.720\n Who cares?\n\n1:58:30.720 --> 1:58:33.920\n It's not like you're doing something terrible with SegNets.\n\n1:58:33.920 --> 1:58:35.600\n You're probably building something that's\n\n1:58:35.600 --> 1:58:39.440\n at least going to help you debug the end to end system a lot.\n\n1:58:39.440 --> 1:58:42.200\n It's very easy to transition from what they have\n\n1:58:42.200 --> 1:58:45.840\n to an end to end kind of thing.\n\n1:58:45.840 --> 1:58:50.520\n And then I presume you would, in the Model Y\n\n1:58:50.520 --> 1:58:52.480\n or maybe in the Model 3, start adding driver\n\n1:58:52.480 --> 1:58:53.600\n sensing with infrared.\n\n1:58:53.600 --> 1:58:58.000\n Yes, I would add infrared camera, infrared lights\n\n1:58:58.000 --> 1:58:59.640\n right away to those cars.\n\n1:59:02.120 --> 1:59:04.920\n And start collecting that data and do all that kind of stuff,\n\n1:59:04.920 --> 1:59:05.440\n yeah.\n\n1:59:05.440 --> 1:59:06.080\n Very much.\n\n1:59:06.080 --> 1:59:07.780\n I think they're already kind of doing it.\n\n1:59:07.780 --> 1:59:09.320\n It's an incredibly minor change.\n\n1:59:09.320 --> 1:59:11.160\n If I actually were CEO of Tesla, first off,\n\n1:59:11.160 --> 1:59:13.080\n I'd be horrified that I wouldn't be able to do\n\n1:59:13.080 --> 1:59:14.000\n a better job as Elon.\n\n1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:16.480\n And then I would try to understand\n\n1:59:16.480 --> 1:59:17.760\n the way he's done things before.\n\n1:59:17.760 --> 1:59:20.720\n You would also have to take over his Twitter.\n\n1:59:20.720 --> 1:59:22.200\n I don't tweet.\n\n1:59:22.200 --> 1:59:24.240\n Yeah, what's your Twitter situation?\n\n1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:25.880\n Why are you so quiet on Twitter?\n\n1:59:25.880 --> 1:59:30.280\n Since Dukama is like what's your social network presence like?\n\n1:59:30.280 --> 1:59:34.280\n Because on Instagram, you do live streams.\n\n1:59:34.280 --> 1:59:39.240\n You understand the music of the internet,\n\n1:59:39.240 --> 1:59:41.520\n but you don't always fully engage into it.\n\n1:59:41.520 --> 1:59:42.800\n You're part time.\n\n1:59:42.800 --> 1:59:44.160\n Well, I used to have a Twitter.\n\n1:59:44.160 --> 1:59:47.600\n Yeah, I mean, Instagram is a pretty place.\n\n1:59:47.600 --> 1:59:49.120\n Instagram is a beautiful place.\n\n1:59:49.120 --> 1:59:49.960\n It glorifies beauty.\n\n1:59:49.960 --> 1:59:53.360\n I like Instagram's values as a network.\n\n1:59:53.360 --> 2:00:00.320\n Twitter glorifies conflict, glorifies shots,\n\n2:00:00.320 --> 2:00:01.400\n taking shots of people.\n\n2:00:01.400 --> 2:00:05.280\n And it's like, you know, Twitter and Donald Trump\n\n2:00:05.280 --> 2:00:08.440\n are perfectly, they're perfect for each other.\n\n2:00:08.440 --> 2:00:12.800\n So Tesla's on the right track in your view.\n\n2:00:12.800 --> 2:00:16.600\n OK, so let's try, let's really try this experiment.\n\n2:00:16.600 --> 2:00:19.720\n If you ran Waymo, let's say they're,\n\n2:00:19.720 --> 2:00:21.160\n I don't know if you agree, but they\n\n2:00:21.160 --> 2:00:25.640\n seem to be at the head of the pack of the kind of,\n\n2:00:25.640 --> 2:00:27.040\n what would you call that approach?\n\n2:00:27.040 --> 2:00:29.000\n Like it's not necessarily lighter based\n\n2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:30.320\n because it's not about lighter.\n\n2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:31.520\n Level four robotaxi.\n\n2:00:31.520 --> 2:00:37.040\n Level four robotaxi, all in before making any revenue.\n\n2:00:37.040 --> 2:00:38.720\n So they're probably at the head of the pack.\n\n2:00:38.720 --> 2:00:42.840\n If you were said, hey, George, can you\n\n2:00:42.840 --> 2:00:47.160\n please run this company for a year, how would you change it?\n\n2:00:47.160 --> 2:00:47.760\n I would go.\n\n2:00:47.760 --> 2:00:49.800\n I would get Anthony Levandowski out of jail,\n\n2:00:49.800 --> 2:00:51.720\n and I would put him in charge of the company.\n\n2:00:56.400 --> 2:00:58.200\n Well, let's try to break that apart.\n\n2:00:58.200 --> 2:01:01.600\n Why do you want to destroy the company by doing that?\n\n2:01:01.600 --> 2:01:09.400\n Or do you mean you like renegade style thinking that pushes,\n\n2:01:09.400 --> 2:01:11.560\n that throws away bureaucracy and goes\n\n2:01:11.560 --> 2:01:12.840\n to first principle thinking?\n\n2:01:12.840 --> 2:01:14.080\n What do you mean by that?\n\n2:01:14.080 --> 2:01:16.040\n I think Anthony Levandowski is a genius,\n\n2:01:16.040 --> 2:01:19.640\n and I think he would come up with a much better idea of what\n\n2:01:19.640 --> 2:01:22.360\n to do with Waymo than me.\n\n2:01:22.360 --> 2:01:23.840\n So you mean that unironically.\n\n2:01:23.840 --> 2:01:24.800\n He is a genius.\n\n2:01:24.800 --> 2:01:25.400\n Oh, yes.\n\n2:01:25.400 --> 2:01:26.640\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n2:01:26.640 --> 2:01:27.600\n Without a doubt.\n\n2:01:27.600 --> 2:01:30.960\n I mean, I'm not saying there's no shortcomings,\n\n2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:34.760\n but in the interactions I've had with him, yeah.\n\n2:01:34.760 --> 2:01:35.720\n What?\n\n2:01:35.720 --> 2:01:38.200\n He's also willing to take, like, who knows\n\n2:01:38.200 --> 2:01:39.400\n what he would do with Waymo?\n\n2:01:39.400 --> 2:01:41.400\n I mean, he's also out there, like far more out there\n\n2:01:41.400 --> 2:01:41.880\n than I am.\n\n2:01:41.880 --> 2:01:43.480\n Yeah, there's big risks.\n\n2:01:43.480 --> 2:01:44.480\n What do you make of him?\n\n2:01:44.480 --> 2:01:47.040\n I was going to talk to him on this podcast,\n\n2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:48.880\n and I was going back and forth.\n\n2:01:48.880 --> 2:01:51.720\n I'm such a gullible, naive human.\n\n2:01:51.720 --> 2:01:53.840\n Like, I see the best in people.\n\n2:01:53.840 --> 2:01:56.720\n And I slowly started to realize that there\n\n2:01:56.720 --> 2:02:02.400\n might be some people out there that, like,\n\n2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:05.280\n have multiple faces to the world.\n\n2:02:05.280 --> 2:02:08.160\n They're, like, deceiving and dishonest.\n\n2:02:08.160 --> 2:02:13.040\n I still refuse to, like, I just, I trust people,\n\n2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:14.640\n and I don't care if I get hurt by it.\n\n2:02:14.640 --> 2:02:16.520\n But, like, you know, sometimes you\n\n2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:18.760\n have to be a little bit careful, especially platform\n\n2:02:18.760 --> 2:02:21.040\n wise and podcast wise.\n\n2:02:21.040 --> 2:02:23.160\n What do you, what am I supposed to think?\n\n2:02:23.160 --> 2:02:26.400\n So you think, you think he's a good person?\n\n2:02:26.400 --> 2:02:27.840\n Oh, I don't know.\n\n2:02:27.840 --> 2:02:30.000\n I don't really make moral judgments.\n\n2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:30.840\n It's difficult to.\n\n2:02:30.840 --> 2:02:32.480\n Oh, I mean this about the Waymo.\n\n2:02:32.480 --> 2:02:34.960\n I actually, I mean that whole idea very nonironically\n\n2:02:34.960 --> 2:02:36.200\n about what I would do.\n\n2:02:36.200 --> 2:02:38.160\n The problem with putting me in charge of Waymo\n\n2:02:38.160 --> 2:02:41.720\n is Waymo is already $10 billion in the hole, right?\n\n2:02:41.720 --> 2:02:44.840\n Whatever idea Waymo does, look, commas profitable, commas\n\n2:02:44.840 --> 2:02:46.680\n raised $8.1 million.\n\n2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:48.180\n That's small, you know, that's small money.\n\n2:02:48.180 --> 2:02:50.840\n Like, I can build a reasonable consumer electronics company\n\n2:02:50.840 --> 2:02:54.200\n and succeed wildly at that and still never be able to pay back\n\n2:02:54.200 --> 2:02:55.800\n Waymo's $10 billion.\n\n2:02:55.800 --> 2:02:58.680\n So I think the basic idea with Waymo, well,\n\n2:02:58.680 --> 2:03:00.880\n forget the $10 billion because they have some backing,\n\n2:03:00.880 --> 2:03:04.000\n but your basic thing is, like, what can we do\n\n2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:05.640\n to start making some money?\n\n2:03:05.640 --> 2:03:07.920\n Well, no, I mean, my bigger idea is, like,\n\n2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:10.320\n whatever the idea is that's gonna save Waymo,\n\n2:03:10.320 --> 2:03:11.440\n I don't have it.\n\n2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:13.480\n It's gonna have to be a big risk idea\n\n2:03:13.480 --> 2:03:15.280\n and I cannot think of a better person\n\n2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:17.840\n than Anthony Levandowski to do it.\n\n2:03:17.840 --> 2:03:20.240\n So that is completely what I would do as CEO of Waymo.\n\n2:03:20.240 --> 2:03:22.640\n I would call myself a transitionary CEO,\n\n2:03:22.640 --> 2:03:24.880\n do everything I can to fix that situation up.\n\n2:03:24.880 --> 2:03:25.720\n I'm gonna see.\n\n2:03:25.720 --> 2:03:26.560\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:27.920 --> 2:03:28.760\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:28.760 --> 2:03:29.760\n Because I can't do it, right?\n\n2:03:29.760 --> 2:03:33.440\n Like, I can't, I mean, I can talk about how\n\n2:03:33.440 --> 2:03:35.260\n what I really wanna do is just apologize\n\n2:03:35.260 --> 2:03:38.120\n for all those corny, you know, ad campaigns\n\n2:03:38.120 --> 2:03:40.160\n and be like, here's the real state of the technology.\n\n2:03:40.160 --> 2:03:42.280\n Yeah, that's, like, I have several criticism.\n\n2:03:42.280 --> 2:03:44.320\n I'm a little bit more bullish on Waymo\n\n2:03:44.320 --> 2:03:48.000\n than you seem to be, but one criticism I have\n\n2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.880\n is it went into corny mode too early.\n\n2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:52.200\n Like, it's still a startup.\n\n2:03:52.200 --> 2:03:53.660\n It hasn't delivered on anything.\n\n2:03:53.660 --> 2:03:56.320\n So it should be, like, more renegade\n\n2:03:56.320 --> 2:03:59.280\n and show off the engineering that they're doing,\n\n2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:00.560\n which just can be impressive,\n\n2:04:00.560 --> 2:04:02.320\n as opposed to doing these weird commercials\n\n2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:07.040\n of, like, your friendly car company.\n\n2:04:07.040 --> 2:04:10.080\n I mean, that's my biggest snipe at Waymo is always,\n\n2:04:10.080 --> 2:04:11.440\n that guy's a paid actor.\n\n2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:12.800\n That guy's not a Waymo user.\n\n2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:13.640\n He's a paid actor.\n\n2:04:13.640 --> 2:04:15.360\n Look here, I found his call sheet.\n\n2:04:15.360 --> 2:04:17.400\n Do kind of like what SpaceX is doing\n\n2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:18.960\n with the rocket launches.\n\n2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:22.200\n Just put the nerds up front, put the engineers up front,\n\n2:04:22.200 --> 2:04:25.720\n and just, like, show failures too, just.\n\n2:04:25.720 --> 2:04:27.880\n I love SpaceX's, yeah.\n\n2:04:27.880 --> 2:04:29.840\n Yeah, the thing that they're doing is right,\n\n2:04:29.840 --> 2:04:31.720\n and it just feels like the right.\n\n2:04:31.720 --> 2:04:32.560\n But.\n\n2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:34.440\n We're all so excited to see them succeed.\n\n2:04:34.440 --> 2:04:35.260\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:35.260 --> 2:04:37.320\n I can't wait to see when it won't fail, you know?\n\n2:04:37.320 --> 2:04:39.400\n Like, you lie to me, I want you to fail.\n\n2:04:39.400 --> 2:04:41.200\n You tell me the truth, you be honest with me,\n\n2:04:41.200 --> 2:04:42.160\n I want you to succeed.\n\n2:04:42.160 --> 2:04:43.000\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:44.120 --> 2:04:49.020\n Ah, yeah, and that requires the renegade CEO, right?\n\n2:04:50.200 --> 2:04:51.480\n I'm with you, I'm with you.\n\n2:04:51.480 --> 2:04:54.000\n I still have a little bit of faith in Waymo\n\n2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:56.520\n for the renegade CEO to step forward, but.\n\n2:04:57.860 --> 2:05:00.600\n It's not, it's not John Kraftik.\n\n2:05:00.600 --> 2:05:02.980\n Yeah, it's, you can't.\n\n2:05:02.980 --> 2:05:04.980\n It's not Chris Hormiston.\n\n2:05:04.980 --> 2:05:07.680\n And those people may be very good at certain things.\n\n2:05:07.680 --> 2:05:08.520\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:08.520 --> 2:05:10.360\n But they're not renegades.\n\n2:05:10.360 --> 2:05:12.040\n Yeah, because these companies are fundamentally,\n\n2:05:12.040 --> 2:05:14.260\n even though we're talking about billion dollars,\n\n2:05:14.260 --> 2:05:15.640\n all these crazy numbers,\n\n2:05:15.640 --> 2:05:19.300\n they're still, like, early stage startups.\n\n2:05:19.300 --> 2:05:21.840\n I mean, and I just, if you are pre revenue\n\n2:05:21.840 --> 2:05:23.120\n and you've raised 10 billion dollars,\n\n2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:26.520\n I have no idea, like, this just doesn't work.\n\n2:05:26.520 --> 2:05:28.040\n You know, it's against everything Silicon Valley.\n\n2:05:28.040 --> 2:05:29.880\n Where's your minimum viable product?\n\n2:05:29.880 --> 2:05:31.600\n You know, where's your users?\n\n2:05:31.600 --> 2:05:33.320\n Where's your growth numbers?\n\n2:05:33.320 --> 2:05:36.280\n This is traditional Silicon Valley.\n\n2:05:36.280 --> 2:05:38.040\n Why do you not apply it to what you think\n\n2:05:38.040 --> 2:05:39.920\n you're too big to fail already, like?\n\n2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:45.780\n How do you think autonomous driving will change society?\n\n2:05:45.780 --> 2:05:50.780\n So the mission is, for comma, to solve self driving.\n\n2:05:52.520 --> 2:05:54.240\n Do you have, like, a vision of the world\n\n2:05:54.240 --> 2:05:55.840\n of how it'll be different?\n\n2:05:57.940 --> 2:06:00.100\n Is it as simple as A to B transportation?\n\n2:06:00.100 --> 2:06:02.540\n Or is there, like, cause these are robots.\n\n2:06:03.640 --> 2:06:05.880\n It's not about autonomous driving in and of itself.\n\n2:06:05.880 --> 2:06:07.520\n It's what the technology enables.\n\n2:06:09.760 --> 2:06:12.200\n It's, I think it's the coolest applied AI problem.\n\n2:06:12.200 --> 2:06:16.360\n I like it because it has a clear path to monetary value.\n\n2:06:17.720 --> 2:06:21.440\n But as far as that being the thing that changes the world,\n\n2:06:21.440 --> 2:06:25.480\n I mean, no, like, there's cute things we're doing in common.\n\n2:06:25.480 --> 2:06:26.960\n Like, who'd have thought you could stick a phone\n\n2:06:26.960 --> 2:06:29.080\n on the windshield and it'll drive.\n\n2:06:29.080 --> 2:06:31.160\n But like, really, the product that you're building\n\n2:06:31.160 --> 2:06:33.920\n is not something that people were not capable\n\n2:06:33.920 --> 2:06:35.760\n of imagining 50 years ago.\n\n2:06:35.760 --> 2:06:37.800\n So no, it doesn't change the world on that front.\n\n2:06:37.800 --> 2:06:39.480\n Could people have imagined the internet 50 years ago?\n\n2:06:39.480 --> 2:06:42.560\n Only true genius visionaries.\n\n2:06:42.560 --> 2:06:45.120\n Everyone could have imagined autonomous cars 50 years ago.\n\n2:06:45.120 --> 2:06:47.000\n It's like a car, but I don't drive it.\n\n2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:49.920\n See, I have this sense, and I told you, like,\n\n2:06:49.920 --> 2:06:54.920\n my longterm dream is robots with which you have deep,\n\n2:06:55.880 --> 2:06:57.920\n with whom you have deep connections, right?\n\n2:06:59.320 --> 2:07:02.600\n And there's different trajectories towards that.\n\n2:07:03.600 --> 2:07:04.440\n And I've been thinking,\n\n2:07:04.440 --> 2:07:07.060\n so I've been thinking of launching a startup.\n\n2:07:07.060 --> 2:07:09.820\n I see autonomous vehicles\n\n2:07:09.820 --> 2:07:11.420\n as a potential trajectory to that.\n\n2:07:11.420 --> 2:07:16.420\n That's not where the direction I would like to go,\n\n2:07:16.580 --> 2:07:19.100\n but I also see Tesla or even Comma AI,\n\n2:07:19.100 --> 2:07:23.820\n like, pivoting into robotics broadly defined\n\n2:07:24.900 --> 2:07:27.140\n at some stage in the way, like you're mentioning,\n\n2:07:27.140 --> 2:07:28.540\n the internet didn't expect.\n\n2:07:29.580 --> 2:07:32.580\n Let's solve, you know, when I say a comma about this,\n\n2:07:32.580 --> 2:07:33.420\n we could talk about this,\n\n2:07:33.420 --> 2:07:35.740\n but let's solve self driving cars first.\n\n2:07:35.740 --> 2:07:37.140\n You gotta stay focused on the mission.\n\n2:07:37.140 --> 2:07:39.260\n Don't, don't, don't, you're not too big to fail.\n\n2:07:39.260 --> 2:07:41.380\n For however much I think Comma's winning,\n\n2:07:41.380 --> 2:07:43.420\n like, no, no, no, no, no, you're winning\n\n2:07:43.420 --> 2:07:45.020\n when you solve level five self driving cars.\n\n2:07:45.020 --> 2:07:46.780\n And until then, you haven't won.\n\n2:07:46.780 --> 2:07:48.900\n And you know, again, you wanna be arrogant\n\n2:07:48.900 --> 2:07:50.620\n in the face of other people, great.\n\n2:07:50.620 --> 2:07:53.780\n You wanna be arrogant in the face of nature, you're an idiot.\n\n2:07:53.780 --> 2:07:56.420\n Stay mission focused, brilliantly put.\n\n2:07:56.420 --> 2:07:58.660\n Like I mentioned, thinking of launching a startup,\n\n2:07:58.660 --> 2:08:01.220\n I've been considering, actually, before COVID,\n\n2:08:01.220 --> 2:08:03.340\n I've been thinking of moving to San Francisco.\n\n2:08:03.340 --> 2:08:06.020\n Ooh, ooh, I wouldn't go there.\n\n2:08:06.020 --> 2:08:09.020\n So why is, well, and now I'm thinking\n\n2:08:09.020 --> 2:08:13.660\n about potentially Austin and we're in San Diego now.\n\n2:08:13.660 --> 2:08:14.940\n San Diego, come here.\n\n2:08:14.940 --> 2:08:19.940\n So why, what, I mean, you're such an interesting human.\n\n2:08:20.540 --> 2:08:23.060\n You've launched so many successful things.\n\n2:08:23.060 --> 2:08:26.220\n What, why San Diego?\n\n2:08:26.220 --> 2:08:27.060\n What do you recommend?\n\n2:08:27.060 --> 2:08:29.300\n Why not San Francisco?\n\n2:08:29.300 --> 2:08:31.820\n Have you thought, so in your case,\n\n2:08:31.820 --> 2:08:33.780\n San Diego with Qualcomm and Snapdragon,\n\n2:08:33.780 --> 2:08:36.860\n I mean, that's an amazing combination.\n\n2:08:36.860 --> 2:08:37.700\n But.\n\n2:08:37.700 --> 2:08:38.540\n That wasn't really why.\n\n2:08:38.540 --> 2:08:39.500\n That wasn't the why?\n\n2:08:39.500 --> 2:08:41.340\n No, I mean, Qualcomm was an afterthought.\n\n2:08:41.340 --> 2:08:42.900\n Qualcomm was, it was a nice thing to think about.\n\n2:08:42.900 --> 2:08:45.140\n It's like, you can have a tech company here.\n\n2:08:45.140 --> 2:08:45.980\n Yeah.\n\n2:08:45.980 --> 2:08:48.300\n And a good one, I mean, you know, I like Qualcomm, but.\n\n2:08:48.300 --> 2:08:49.140\n No.\n\n2:08:49.140 --> 2:08:50.540\n Well, so why San Diego better than San Francisco?\n\n2:08:50.540 --> 2:08:51.900\n Why does San Francisco suck?\n\n2:08:51.900 --> 2:08:53.020\n Well, so, okay, so first off,\n\n2:08:53.020 --> 2:08:55.300\n we all kind of said like, we wanna stay in California.\n\n2:08:55.300 --> 2:08:56.660\n People like the ocean.\n\n2:08:57.620 --> 2:09:00.020\n You know, California, for its flaws,\n\n2:09:00.020 --> 2:09:02.380\n it's like a lot of the flaws of California\n\n2:09:02.380 --> 2:09:03.900\n are not necessarily California as a whole,\n\n2:09:03.900 --> 2:09:05.740\n and they're much more San Francisco specific.\n\n2:09:05.740 --> 2:09:06.700\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:06.700 --> 2:09:09.860\n San Francisco, so I think first tier cities in general\n\n2:09:09.860 --> 2:09:11.500\n have stopped wanting growth.\n\n2:09:13.140 --> 2:09:15.460\n Well, you have like in San Francisco, you know,\n\n2:09:15.460 --> 2:09:18.740\n the voting class always votes to not build more houses\n\n2:09:18.740 --> 2:09:19.980\n because they own all the houses.\n\n2:09:19.980 --> 2:09:21.820\n And they're like, well, you know,\n\n2:09:21.820 --> 2:09:23.860\n once people have figured out how to vote themselves\n\n2:09:23.860 --> 2:09:25.180\n more money, they're gonna do it.\n\n2:09:25.180 --> 2:09:27.900\n It is so insanely corrupt.\n\n2:09:27.900 --> 2:09:31.620\n It is not balanced at all, like political party wise,\n\n2:09:31.620 --> 2:09:34.700\n you know, it's a one party city and.\n\n2:09:34.700 --> 2:09:36.700\n For all the discussion of diversity,\n\n2:09:38.700 --> 2:09:42.140\n it stops lacking real diversity of thought,\n\n2:09:42.140 --> 2:09:47.140\n of background, of approaches, of strategies, of ideas.\n\n2:09:48.540 --> 2:09:51.180\n It's kind of a strange place\n\n2:09:51.180 --> 2:09:54.380\n that it's the loudest people about diversity\n\n2:09:54.380 --> 2:09:56.420\n and the biggest lack of diversity.\n\n2:09:56.420 --> 2:09:58.620\n I mean, that's what they say, right?\n\n2:09:58.620 --> 2:10:00.340\n It's the projection.\n\n2:10:00.340 --> 2:10:02.140\n Projection, yeah.\n\n2:10:02.140 --> 2:10:02.980\n Yeah, it's interesting.\n\n2:10:02.980 --> 2:10:04.500\n And even people in Silicon Valley tell me\n\n2:10:04.500 --> 2:10:07.940\n that's like high up people,\n\n2:10:07.940 --> 2:10:10.100\n everybody is like, this is a terrible place.\n\n2:10:10.100 --> 2:10:10.940\n It doesn't make sense.\n\n2:10:10.940 --> 2:10:13.220\n I mean, and coronavirus is really what killed it.\n\n2:10:13.220 --> 2:10:17.340\n San Francisco was the number one exodus\n\n2:10:17.340 --> 2:10:18.900\n during coronavirus.\n\n2:10:18.900 --> 2:10:21.660\n We still think San Diego is a good place to be.\n\n2:10:21.660 --> 2:10:22.500\n Yeah.\n\n2:10:23.460 --> 2:10:24.740\n Yeah, I mean, we'll see.\n\n2:10:24.740 --> 2:10:29.740\n We'll see what happens with California a bit longer term.\n\n2:10:29.780 --> 2:10:32.100\n Like Austin's an interesting choice.\n\n2:10:32.100 --> 2:10:33.940\n I wouldn't, I don't have really anything bad to say\n\n2:10:33.940 --> 2:10:35.740\n about Austin either,\n\n2:10:35.740 --> 2:10:37.940\n except for the extreme heat in the summer,\n\n2:10:37.940 --> 2:10:40.180\n which, but that's like very on the surface, right?\n\n2:10:40.180 --> 2:10:43.700\n I think as far as like an ecosystem goes, it's cool.\n\n2:10:43.700 --> 2:10:45.540\n I personally love Colorado.\n\n2:10:45.540 --> 2:10:47.100\n Colorado's great.\n\n2:10:47.100 --> 2:10:49.140\n Yeah, I mean, you have these states that are,\n\n2:10:49.140 --> 2:10:51.380\n like just way better run.\n\n2:10:51.380 --> 2:10:55.380\n California is, you know, it's especially San Francisco.\n\n2:10:55.380 --> 2:10:58.460\n It's not a tie horse and like, yeah.\n\n2:10:58.460 --> 2:11:02.620\n Can I ask you for advice to me and to others\n\n2:11:02.620 --> 2:11:07.540\n about what's it take to build a successful startup?\n\n2:11:07.540 --> 2:11:08.380\n Oh, I don't know.\n\n2:11:08.380 --> 2:11:09.220\n I haven't done that.\n\n2:11:09.220 --> 2:11:10.740\n Talk to someone who did that.\n\n2:11:10.740 --> 2:11:12.140\n Well, you've, you know,\n\n2:11:14.980 --> 2:11:16.460\n this is like another book of years\n\n2:11:16.460 --> 2:11:18.860\n that I'll buy for $67, I suppose.\n\n2:11:18.860 --> 2:11:20.700\n So there's, um.\n\n2:11:20.700 --> 2:11:24.140\n One of these days I'll sell out.\n\n2:11:24.140 --> 2:11:24.980\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n2:11:24.980 --> 2:11:26.020\n Jailbreaks are going to be a dollar\n\n2:11:26.020 --> 2:11:27.860\n and books are going to be 67.\n\n2:11:27.860 --> 2:11:32.060\n How I jailbroke the iPhone by George Hots.\n\n2:11:32.060 --> 2:11:32.900\n That's right.\n\n2:11:32.900 --> 2:11:35.620\n How I jail broke the iPhone and you can too.\n\n2:11:35.620 --> 2:11:36.860\n You can too.\n\n2:11:36.860 --> 2:11:37.700\n 67 dollars.\n\n2:11:37.700 --> 2:11:39.020\n In 21 days.\n\n2:11:39.020 --> 2:11:39.860\n That's right.\n\n2:11:39.860 --> 2:11:40.700\n That's right.\n\n2:11:40.700 --> 2:11:41.540\n Oh God.\n\n2:11:41.540 --> 2:11:42.380\n Okay, I can't wait.\n\n2:11:42.380 --> 2:11:44.940\n But quite, so you have an introspective,\n\n2:11:44.940 --> 2:11:49.460\n you have built a very unique company.\n\n2:11:49.460 --> 2:11:52.300\n I mean, not you, but you and others.\n\n2:11:53.180 --> 2:11:54.700\n But I don't know.\n\n2:11:55.620 --> 2:11:56.940\n There's no, there's nothing.\n\n2:11:56.940 --> 2:11:57.780\n You have an introspective,\n\n2:11:57.780 --> 2:12:00.900\n you haven't really sat down and thought about like,\n\n2:12:01.780 --> 2:12:04.180\n well, like if you and I were having a bunch of,\n\n2:12:04.180 --> 2:12:06.180\n we're having some beers\n\n2:12:06.180 --> 2:12:08.100\n and you're seeing that I'm depressed\n\n2:12:08.100 --> 2:12:09.860\n and whatever, I'm struggling.\n\n2:12:09.860 --> 2:12:11.580\n There's no advice you can give?\n\n2:12:11.580 --> 2:12:13.100\n Oh, I mean.\n\n2:12:13.100 --> 2:12:13.940\n More beer?\n\n2:12:13.940 --> 2:12:15.100\n More beer?\n\n2:12:15.100 --> 2:12:20.100\n Um, yeah, I think it's all very like situation dependent.\n\n2:12:23.340 --> 2:12:25.860\n Here's, okay, if I can give a generic piece of advice,\n\n2:12:25.860 --> 2:12:28.140\n it's the technology always wins.\n\n2:12:28.140 --> 2:12:30.740\n The better technology always wins.\n\n2:12:30.740 --> 2:12:33.300\n And lying always loses.\n\n2:12:35.180 --> 2:12:37.220\n Build technology and don't lie.\n\n2:12:38.580 --> 2:12:39.420\n I'm with you.\n\n2:12:39.420 --> 2:12:40.420\n I agree very much.\n\n2:12:40.420 --> 2:12:41.340\n The long run, long run.\n\n2:12:41.340 --> 2:12:42.180\n Sure.\n\n2:12:42.180 --> 2:12:43.020\n That's the long run, yeah.\n\n2:12:43.020 --> 2:12:44.860\n The market can remain irrational longer\n\n2:12:44.860 --> 2:12:46.540\n than you can remain solvent.\n\n2:12:46.540 --> 2:12:47.380\n True fact.\n\n2:12:47.380 --> 2:12:49.260\n Well, this is an interesting point\n\n2:12:49.260 --> 2:12:52.620\n because I ethically and just as a human believe that\n\n2:12:54.380 --> 2:12:58.980\n like hype and smoke and mirrors is not\n\n2:12:58.980 --> 2:13:02.740\n at any stage of the company is a good strategy.\n\n2:13:02.740 --> 2:13:04.900\n I mean, there's some like, you know,\n\n2:13:04.900 --> 2:13:07.020\n PR magic kind of like, you know.\n\n2:13:07.020 --> 2:13:08.540\n Oh, hype around a new product, right?\n\n2:13:08.540 --> 2:13:09.780\n If there's a call to action,\n\n2:13:09.780 --> 2:13:10.980\n if there's like a call to action,\n\n2:13:10.980 --> 2:13:13.060\n like buy my new GPU, look at it.\n\n2:13:13.060 --> 2:13:14.940\n It takes up three slots and it's this big.\n\n2:13:14.940 --> 2:13:15.780\n It's huge.\n\n2:13:15.780 --> 2:13:16.620\n Buy my GPU.\n\n2:13:16.620 --> 2:13:17.460\n Yeah, that's great.\n\n2:13:17.460 --> 2:13:18.300\n If you look at, you know,\n\n2:13:18.300 --> 2:13:20.780\n especially in the AI space broadly,\n\n2:13:20.780 --> 2:13:22.780\n but autonomous vehicles,\n\n2:13:22.780 --> 2:13:26.540\n like you can raise a huge amount of money on nothing.\n\n2:13:26.540 --> 2:13:29.220\n And the question to me is like, I'm against that.\n\n2:13:30.060 --> 2:13:31.500\n I'll never be part of that.\n\n2:13:31.500 --> 2:13:35.820\n I don't think, I hope not, willingly not.\n\n2:13:36.820 --> 2:13:40.020\n But like, is there something to be said\n\n2:13:40.020 --> 2:13:44.980\n to essentially lying to raise money,\n\n2:13:44.980 --> 2:13:47.860\n like fake it till you make it kind of thing?\n\n2:13:47.860 --> 2:13:50.140\n I mean, this is Billy McFarland in the Fyre Festival.\n\n2:13:50.140 --> 2:13:53.460\n Like we all experienced, you know,\n\n2:13:53.460 --> 2:13:54.300\n what happens with that.\n\n2:13:54.300 --> 2:13:57.460\n No, no, don't fake it till you make it.\n\n2:13:57.460 --> 2:14:00.540\n Be honest and hope you make it the whole way.\n\n2:14:00.540 --> 2:14:01.940\n The technology wins.\n\n2:14:01.940 --> 2:14:02.980\n Right, the technology wins.\n\n2:14:02.980 --> 2:14:06.820\n And like, there is, I'm not used to like the anti hype,\n\n2:14:06.820 --> 2:14:08.900\n you know, that's a Slava KPSS reference,\n\n2:14:08.900 --> 2:14:13.140\n but hype isn't necessarily bad.\n\n2:14:13.140 --> 2:14:17.580\n I loved camping out for the iPhones, you know,\n\n2:14:17.580 --> 2:14:21.020\n and as long as the hype is backed by like substance,\n\n2:14:21.020 --> 2:14:23.780\n as long as it's backed by something I can actually buy,\n\n2:14:23.780 --> 2:14:26.740\n and like it's real, then hype is great\n\n2:14:26.740 --> 2:14:28.700\n and it's a great feeling.\n\n2:14:28.700 --> 2:14:30.860\n It's when the hype is backed by lies\n\n2:14:30.860 --> 2:14:32.060\n that it's a bad feeling.\n\n2:14:32.060 --> 2:14:34.540\n I mean, a lot of people call Elon Musk a fraud.\n\n2:14:34.540 --> 2:14:35.620\n How could he be a fraud?\n\n2:14:35.620 --> 2:14:37.740\n I've noticed this, this kind of interesting effect,\n\n2:14:37.740 --> 2:14:42.300\n which is he does tend to over promise\n\n2:14:42.300 --> 2:14:45.660\n and deliver, what's the better way to phrase it?\n\n2:14:45.660 --> 2:14:49.220\n Promise a timeline that he doesn't deliver on,\n\n2:14:49.220 --> 2:14:51.740\n he delivers much later on.\n\n2:14:51.740 --> 2:14:52.820\n What do you think about that?\n\n2:14:52.820 --> 2:14:56.220\n Cause I do that, I think that's a programmer thing too.\n\n2:14:56.220 --> 2:14:57.540\n I do that as well.\n\n2:14:57.540 --> 2:15:01.300\n You think that's a really bad thing to do or is that okay?\n\n2:15:01.300 --> 2:15:03.900\n I think that's, again, as long as like,\n\n2:15:03.900 --> 2:15:06.940\n you're working toward it and you're gonna deliver on it,\n\n2:15:06.940 --> 2:15:10.260\n it's not too far off, right?\n\n2:15:10.260 --> 2:15:11.100\n Right?\n\n2:15:11.100 --> 2:15:14.900\n Like, you know, the whole autonomous vehicle thing,\n\n2:15:14.900 --> 2:15:18.620\n it's like, I mean, I still think Tesla's on track\n\n2:15:18.620 --> 2:15:19.740\n to beat us.\n\n2:15:19.740 --> 2:15:21.900\n I still think even with their missteps,\n\n2:15:21.900 --> 2:15:24.420\n they have advantages we don't have.\n\n2:15:25.660 --> 2:15:28.100\n You know, Elon is better than me\n\n2:15:28.100 --> 2:15:33.060\n at like marshaling massive amounts of resources.\n\n2:15:33.060 --> 2:15:36.260\n So, you know, I still think given the fact\n\n2:15:36.260 --> 2:15:38.220\n they're maybe making some wrong decisions,\n\n2:15:38.220 --> 2:15:39.300\n they'll end up winning.\n\n2:15:39.300 --> 2:15:42.620\n And like, it's fine to hype it\n\n2:15:42.620 --> 2:15:44.900\n if you're actually gonna win, right?\n\n2:15:44.900 --> 2:15:47.220\n Like if Elon says, look, we're gonna be landing rockets\n\n2:15:47.220 --> 2:15:49.340\n back on earth in a year and it takes four,\n\n2:15:49.340 --> 2:15:53.540\n like, you know, he landed a rocket back on earth\n\n2:15:53.540 --> 2:15:55.420\n and he was working toward it the whole time.\n\n2:15:55.420 --> 2:15:57.060\n I think there's some amount of like,\n\n2:15:57.060 --> 2:15:59.260\n I think when it becomes wrong is if you know\n\n2:15:59.260 --> 2:16:00.460\n you're not gonna meet that deadline.\n\n2:16:00.460 --> 2:16:01.540\n If you're lying.\n\n2:16:01.540 --> 2:16:03.260\n Yeah, that's brilliantly put.\n\n2:16:03.260 --> 2:16:06.860\n Like this is what people don't understand, I think.\n\n2:16:06.860 --> 2:16:09.500\n Like Elon believes everything he says.\n\n2:16:09.500 --> 2:16:12.140\n He does, as far as I can tell, he does.\n\n2:16:12.140 --> 2:16:14.780\n And I detected that in myself too.\n\n2:16:14.780 --> 2:16:17.620\n Like if I, it's only bullshit\n\n2:16:17.620 --> 2:16:21.460\n if you're like conscious of yourself lying.\n\n2:16:21.460 --> 2:16:22.500\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n2:16:22.500 --> 2:16:23.420\n Yeah.\n\n2:16:23.420 --> 2:16:25.660\n Now you can't take that to such an extreme, right?\n\n2:16:25.660 --> 2:16:27.620\n Like in a way, I think maybe Billy McFarland\n\n2:16:27.620 --> 2:16:30.020\n believed everything he said too.\n\n2:16:30.020 --> 2:16:31.460\n Right, that's how you start a cult\n\n2:16:31.460 --> 2:16:33.820\n and everybody kills themselves.\n\n2:16:33.820 --> 2:16:34.660\n Yeah.\n\n2:16:34.660 --> 2:16:36.020\n Yeah, like it's, you need, you need,\n\n2:16:36.020 --> 2:16:39.300\n if there's like some factor on it, it's fine.\n\n2:16:39.300 --> 2:16:41.820\n And you need some people to like, you know,\n\n2:16:41.820 --> 2:16:43.700\n keep you in check, but like,\n\n2:16:44.580 --> 2:16:46.580\n if you deliver on most of the things you say\n\n2:16:46.580 --> 2:16:48.780\n and just the timelines are off, yeah.\n\n2:16:48.780 --> 2:16:50.300\n It does piss people off though.\n\n2:16:50.300 --> 2:16:53.300\n I wonder, but who cares?\n\n2:16:53.300 --> 2:16:55.260\n In a long arc of history, the people,\n\n2:16:55.260 --> 2:16:58.100\n everybody gets pissed off at the people who succeed,\n\n2:16:58.100 --> 2:16:59.260\n which is one of the things\n\n2:16:59.260 --> 2:17:01.820\n that frustrates me about this world,\n\n2:17:01.820 --> 2:17:06.820\n is they don't celebrate the success of others.\n\n2:17:07.660 --> 2:17:12.660\n Like there's so many people that want Elon to fail.\n\n2:17:12.900 --> 2:17:14.860\n It's so fascinating to me.\n\n2:17:14.860 --> 2:17:17.220\n Like what is wrong with you?\n\n2:17:18.180 --> 2:17:21.620\n Like, so Elon Musk talks about like people shorting,\n\n2:17:21.620 --> 2:17:23.580\n like they talk about financial,\n\n2:17:23.580 --> 2:17:25.340\n but I think it's much bigger than the financials.\n\n2:17:25.340 --> 2:17:27.860\n I've seen like the human factors community,\n\n2:17:27.860 --> 2:17:31.540\n they want, they want other people to fail.\n\n2:17:31.540 --> 2:17:32.940\n Why, why, why?\n\n2:17:32.940 --> 2:17:35.860\n Like even people, the harshest thing is like,\n\n2:17:36.740 --> 2:17:38.140\n you know, even people that like seem\n\n2:17:38.140 --> 2:17:41.980\n to really hate Donald Trump, they want him to fail\n\n2:17:41.980 --> 2:17:43.020\n or like the other president\n\n2:17:43.020 --> 2:17:45.900\n or they want Barack Obama to fail.\n\n2:17:45.900 --> 2:17:47.140\n It's like.\n\n2:17:47.140 --> 2:17:49.740\n Yeah, we're all on the same boat, man.\n\n2:17:49.740 --> 2:17:51.660\n It's weird, but I want that,\n\n2:17:51.660 --> 2:17:54.100\n I would love to inspire that part of the world to change\n\n2:17:54.100 --> 2:17:58.540\n because damn it, if the human species is gonna survive,\n\n2:17:58.540 --> 2:18:00.460\n we should celebrate success.\n\n2:18:00.460 --> 2:18:02.780\n Like it seems like the efficient thing to do\n\n2:18:02.780 --> 2:18:06.300\n in this objective function that we're all striving for\n\n2:18:06.300 --> 2:18:09.060\n is to celebrate the ones that like figure out\n\n2:18:09.060 --> 2:18:11.820\n how to like do better at that objective function\n\n2:18:11.820 --> 2:18:16.580\n as opposed to like dragging them down back into the mud.\n\n2:18:16.580 --> 2:18:19.100\n I think there is, this is the speech I always give\n\n2:18:19.100 --> 2:18:21.700\n about the commenters on Hacker News.\n\n2:18:21.700 --> 2:18:23.260\n So first off, something to remember\n\n2:18:23.260 --> 2:18:26.140\n about the internet in general is commenters\n\n2:18:26.140 --> 2:18:29.300\n are not representative of the population.\n\n2:18:29.300 --> 2:18:31.460\n I don't comment on anything.\n\n2:18:31.460 --> 2:18:34.180\n You know, commenters are representative\n\n2:18:34.180 --> 2:18:36.660\n of a certain sliver of the population.\n\n2:18:36.660 --> 2:18:39.540\n And on Hacker News, a common thing I'll see\n\n2:18:39.540 --> 2:18:42.100\n is when you'll see something that's like,\n\n2:18:42.100 --> 2:18:47.100\n you know, promises to be wild out there and innovative.\n\n2:18:47.500 --> 2:18:49.700\n There is some amount of, you know,\n\n2:18:49.700 --> 2:18:50.940\n checking them back to earth,\n\n2:18:50.940 --> 2:18:53.860\n but there's also some amount of if this thing succeeds,\n\n2:18:55.260 --> 2:18:57.580\n well, I'm 36 and I've worked\n\n2:18:57.580 --> 2:19:00.340\n at large tech companies my whole life.\n\n2:19:02.300 --> 2:19:05.020\n They can't succeed because if they succeed,\n\n2:19:05.020 --> 2:19:07.180\n that would mean that I could have done something different\n\n2:19:07.180 --> 2:19:09.220\n with my life, but we know that I couldn't have,\n\n2:19:09.220 --> 2:19:10.140\n we know that I couldn't have,\n\n2:19:10.140 --> 2:19:11.940\n and that's why they're gonna fail.\n\n2:19:11.940 --> 2:19:13.100\n And they have to root for them to fail\n\n2:19:13.100 --> 2:19:15.940\n to kind of maintain their world image.\n\n2:19:15.940 --> 2:19:17.860\n So tune it out.\n\n2:19:17.860 --> 2:19:21.860\n And they comment, well, it's hard, I, so one of the things,\n\n2:19:21.860 --> 2:19:25.260\n one of the things I'm considering startup wise\n\n2:19:25.260 --> 2:19:27.620\n is to change that.\n\n2:19:27.620 --> 2:19:31.700\n Cause I think the, I think it's also a technology problem.\n\n2:19:31.700 --> 2:19:33.060\n It's a platform problem.\n\n2:19:33.060 --> 2:19:33.900\n I agree.\n\n2:19:33.900 --> 2:19:35.980\n It's like, because the thing you said,\n\n2:19:35.980 --> 2:19:37.340\n most people don't comment.\n\n2:19:39.660 --> 2:19:41.660\n I think most people want to comment.\n\n2:19:42.940 --> 2:19:45.180\n They just don't because it's all the assholes\n\n2:19:45.180 --> 2:19:46.020\n who are commenting.\n\n2:19:46.020 --> 2:19:47.620\n Exactly, I don't want to be grouped in with them.\n\n2:19:47.620 --> 2:19:49.420\n You don't want to be at a party\n\n2:19:49.420 --> 2:19:50.780\n where everyone is an asshole.\n\n2:19:50.780 --> 2:19:54.500\n And so they, but that's a platform problem.\n\n2:19:54.500 --> 2:19:56.100\n I can't believe what Reddit's become.\n\n2:19:56.100 --> 2:19:59.440\n I can't believe the group thinking, Reddit comments.\n\n2:20:00.580 --> 2:20:02.700\n There's a, Reddit is an interesting one\n\n2:20:02.700 --> 2:20:05.100\n because they're subreddits.\n\n2:20:05.100 --> 2:20:09.260\n And so you can still see, especially small subreddits\n\n2:20:09.260 --> 2:20:11.940\n that like, that are a little like havens\n\n2:20:11.940 --> 2:20:16.140\n of like joy and positivity and like deep,\n\n2:20:16.140 --> 2:20:18.860\n even disagreement, but like nuanced discussion.\n\n2:20:18.860 --> 2:20:21.700\n But it's only like small little pockets,\n\n2:20:21.700 --> 2:20:23.460\n but that's emergent.\n\n2:20:23.460 --> 2:20:26.780\n The platform is not helping that or hurting that.\n\n2:20:26.780 --> 2:20:31.100\n So I guess naturally something about the internet,\n\n2:20:31.100 --> 2:20:34.380\n if you don't put in a lot of effort to encourage\n\n2:20:34.380 --> 2:20:37.180\n nuance and positive, good vibes,\n\n2:20:37.180 --> 2:20:41.140\n it's naturally going to decline into chaos.\n\n2:20:41.140 --> 2:20:42.860\n I would love to see someone do this well.\n\n2:20:42.860 --> 2:20:43.780\n Yeah.\n\n2:20:43.780 --> 2:20:45.540\n I think it's, yeah, very doable.\n\n2:20:45.540 --> 2:20:49.740\n I think actually, so I feel like Twitter\n\n2:20:49.740 --> 2:20:52.060\n could be overthrown.\n\n2:20:52.060 --> 2:20:54.300\n Yashua Bach talked about how like,\n\n2:20:55.220 --> 2:20:58.020\n if you have like and retweet,\n\n2:20:58.020 --> 2:21:02.120\n like that's only positive wiring, right?\n\n2:21:02.120 --> 2:21:05.580\n The only way to do anything like negative there\n\n2:21:05.580 --> 2:21:08.300\n is with a comment.\n\n2:21:08.300 --> 2:21:12.420\n And that's like that asymmetry is what gives,\n\n2:21:12.420 --> 2:21:15.620\n you know, Twitter its particular toxicness.\n\n2:21:15.620 --> 2:21:18.060\n Whereas I find YouTube comments to be much better\n\n2:21:18.060 --> 2:21:21.540\n because YouTube comments have an up and a down\n\n2:21:21.540 --> 2:21:23.500\n and they don't show the downvotes.\n\n2:21:23.500 --> 2:21:26.820\n Without getting into depth of this particular discussion,\n\n2:21:26.820 --> 2:21:29.580\n the point is to explore possibilities\n\n2:21:29.580 --> 2:21:30.860\n and get a lot of data on it.\n\n2:21:30.860 --> 2:21:34.780\n Because I mean, I could disagree with what you just said.\n\n2:21:34.780 --> 2:21:36.100\n The point is it's unclear.\n\n2:21:36.100 --> 2:21:39.860\n It hasn't been explored in a really rich way.\n\n2:21:39.860 --> 2:21:44.700\n Like these questions of how to create platforms\n\n2:21:44.700 --> 2:21:46.100\n that encourage positivity.\n\n2:21:47.100 --> 2:21:49.580\n Yeah, I think it's a technology problem.\n\n2:21:49.580 --> 2:21:51.980\n And I think we'll look back at Twitter as it is now.\n\n2:21:51.980 --> 2:21:53.900\n Maybe it'll happen within Twitter,\n\n2:21:53.900 --> 2:21:56.460\n but most likely somebody overthrows them\n\n2:21:56.460 --> 2:22:00.500\n is we'll look back at Twitter and say,\n\n2:22:00.500 --> 2:22:03.220\n can't believe we put up with this level of toxicity.\n\n2:22:03.220 --> 2:22:05.100\n You need a different business model too.\n\n2:22:05.100 --> 2:22:07.700\n Any social network that fundamentally has advertising\n\n2:22:07.700 --> 2:22:10.460\n as a business model, this was in The Social Dilemma,\n\n2:22:10.460 --> 2:22:11.740\n which I didn't watch, but I liked it.\n\n2:22:11.740 --> 2:22:12.940\n It's like, you know, there's always the, you know,\n\n2:22:12.940 --> 2:22:15.380\n you're the product, you're not the,\n\n2:22:15.380 --> 2:22:17.980\n but they had a nuanced take on it that I really liked.\n\n2:22:17.980 --> 2:22:22.980\n And it said, the product being sold is influence over you.\n\n2:22:24.660 --> 2:22:27.140\n The product being sold is literally your,\n\n2:22:27.140 --> 2:22:28.740\n you know, influence on you.\n\n2:22:29.820 --> 2:22:33.660\n Like that can't be, if that's your idea, okay.\n\n2:22:33.660 --> 2:22:35.420\n Well, you know, guess what?\n\n2:22:35.420 --> 2:22:37.060\n It can't not be toxic.\n\n2:22:37.060 --> 2:22:39.420\n Yeah, maybe there's ways to spin it,\n\n2:22:39.420 --> 2:22:42.540\n like with giving a lot more control to the user\n\n2:22:42.540 --> 2:22:44.660\n and transparency to see what is happening to them\n\n2:22:44.660 --> 2:22:47.300\n as opposed to in the shadows, it's possible,\n\n2:22:47.300 --> 2:22:49.380\n but that can't be the primary source of.\n\n2:22:49.380 --> 2:22:51.980\n But the users aren't, no one's gonna use that.\n\n2:22:51.980 --> 2:22:54.020\n It depends, it depends, it depends.\n\n2:22:54.020 --> 2:22:57.140\n I think that the, you're not going to,\n\n2:22:57.140 --> 2:23:00.220\n you can't depend on self awareness of the users.\n\n2:23:00.220 --> 2:23:04.460\n It's a longer discussion because you can't depend on it,\n\n2:23:04.460 --> 2:23:09.460\n but you can reward self awareness.\n\n2:23:09.740 --> 2:23:12.340\n Like if for the ones who are willing to put in the work\n\n2:23:12.340 --> 2:23:16.060\n of self awareness, you can reward them and incentivize\n\n2:23:16.060 --> 2:23:18.860\n and perhaps be pleasantly surprised how many people\n\n2:23:20.180 --> 2:23:23.260\n are willing to be self aware on the internet.\n\n2:23:23.260 --> 2:23:24.380\n Like we are in real life.\n\n2:23:24.380 --> 2:23:26.940\n Like I'm putting in a lot of effort with you right now,\n\n2:23:26.940 --> 2:23:30.300\n being self aware about if I say something stupid or mean,\n\n2:23:30.300 --> 2:23:32.740\n I'll like look at your like body language.\n\n2:23:32.740 --> 2:23:33.700\n Like I'm putting in that effort.\n\n2:23:33.700 --> 2:23:36.260\n It's costly for an introvert, very costly.\n\n2:23:36.260 --> 2:23:38.740\n But on the internet, fuck it.\n\n2:23:39.620 --> 2:23:42.940\n Like most people are like, I don't care if this hurts\n\n2:23:42.940 --> 2:23:46.220\n somebody, I don't care if this is not interesting\n\n2:23:46.220 --> 2:23:48.660\n or if this is, yeah, it's a mean or whatever.\n\n2:23:48.660 --> 2:23:50.980\n I think so much of the engagement today on the internet\n\n2:23:50.980 --> 2:23:53.060\n is so disingenuine too.\n\n2:23:53.060 --> 2:23:54.620\n You're not doing this out of a genuine,\n\n2:23:54.620 --> 2:23:55.500\n this is what you think.\n\n2:23:55.500 --> 2:23:57.660\n You're doing this just straight up to manipulate others.\n\n2:23:57.660 --> 2:23:59.660\n Whether you're in, you just became an ad.\n\n2:23:59.660 --> 2:24:02.780\n Yeah, okay, let's talk about a fun topic,\n\n2:24:02.780 --> 2:24:04.420\n which is programming.\n\n2:24:04.420 --> 2:24:05.780\n Here's another book idea for you.\n\n2:24:05.780 --> 2:24:07.300\n Let me pitch.\n\n2:24:07.300 --> 2:24:09.700\n What's your perfect programming setup?\n\n2:24:09.700 --> 2:24:12.660\n So like this by George Hots.\n\n2:24:12.660 --> 2:24:17.500\n So like what, listen, you're.\n\n2:24:17.500 --> 2:24:20.340\n Give me a MacBook Air, sit me in a corner of a hotel room\n\n2:24:20.340 --> 2:24:21.180\n and you know I'll still ask you.\n\n2:24:21.180 --> 2:24:22.020\n So you really don't care.\n\n2:24:22.020 --> 2:24:27.020\n You don't fetishize like multiple monitors, keyboard.\n\n2:24:27.020 --> 2:24:30.260\n Those things are nice and I'm not gonna say no to them,\n\n2:24:30.260 --> 2:24:33.300\n but did they automatically unlock tons of productivity?\n\n2:24:33.300 --> 2:24:34.140\n No, not at all.\n\n2:24:34.140 --> 2:24:36.300\n I have definitely been more productive on a MacBook Air\n\n2:24:36.300 --> 2:24:38.300\n in a corner of a hotel room.\n\n2:24:38.300 --> 2:24:41.620\n What about IDE?\n\n2:24:41.620 --> 2:24:45.980\n So which operating system do you love?\n\n2:24:45.980 --> 2:24:49.020\n What text editor do you use IDE?\n\n2:24:49.020 --> 2:24:53.020\n What, is there something that is like the perfect,\n\n2:24:53.020 --> 2:24:57.020\n if you could just say the perfect productivity setup\n\n2:24:57.020 --> 2:24:57.860\n for George Hots.\n\n2:24:57.860 --> 2:24:58.700\n It doesn't matter.\n\n2:24:58.700 --> 2:25:00.420\n It literally doesn't matter.\n\n2:25:00.420 --> 2:25:03.100\n You know, I guess I code most of the time in Vim.\n\n2:25:03.100 --> 2:25:05.020\n Like literally I'm using an editor from the 70s.\n\n2:25:05.020 --> 2:25:07.460\n You know, you didn't make anything better.\n\n2:25:07.460 --> 2:25:09.060\n Okay, VS code is nice for reading code.\n\n2:25:09.060 --> 2:25:10.820\n There's a few things that are nice about it.\n\n2:25:10.820 --> 2:25:13.460\n I think that you can build much better tools.\n\n2:25:13.460 --> 2:25:17.260\n How like IDA's xrefs work way better than VS codes, why?\n\n2:25:18.660 --> 2:25:20.760\n Yeah, actually that's a good question, like why?\n\n2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:24.360\n I still use, sorry, Emacs for most.\n\n2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:28.860\n I've actually never, I have to confess something dark.\n\n2:25:28.860 --> 2:25:31.100\n So I've never used Vim.\n\n2:25:32.620 --> 2:25:34.820\n I think maybe I'm just afraid\n\n2:25:36.460 --> 2:25:39.340\n that my life has been like a waste.\n\n2:25:39.340 --> 2:25:43.500\n I'm so, I'm not evangelical about Emacs.\n\n2:25:43.500 --> 2:25:44.620\n I think this.\n\n2:25:44.620 --> 2:25:47.820\n This is how I feel about TensorFlow versus PyTorch.\n\n2:25:47.820 --> 2:25:50.300\n Having just like, we've switched everything to PyTorch now.\n\n2:25:50.300 --> 2:25:51.900\n Put months into the switch.\n\n2:25:51.900 --> 2:25:54.580\n I have felt like I've wasted years on TensorFlow.\n\n2:25:54.580 --> 2:25:56.300\n I can't believe it.\n\n2:25:56.300 --> 2:25:58.380\n I can't believe how much better PyTorch is.\n\n2:25:58.380 --> 2:25:59.620\n Yeah.\n\n2:25:59.620 --> 2:26:01.500\n I've used Emacs and Vim, doesn't matter.\n\n2:26:01.500 --> 2:26:03.060\n Yeah, it's still just my heart.\n\n2:26:03.060 --> 2:26:04.700\n Somehow I fell in love with Lisp.\n\n2:26:04.700 --> 2:26:05.540\n I don't know why.\n\n2:26:05.540 --> 2:26:08.140\n You can't, the heart wants what the heart wants.\n\n2:26:08.140 --> 2:26:10.480\n I don't understand it, but it just connected with me.\n\n2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:11.700\n Maybe it's the functional language\n\n2:26:11.700 --> 2:26:13.260\n that first I connected with.\n\n2:26:13.260 --> 2:26:15.860\n Maybe it's because so many of the AI courses\n\n2:26:15.860 --> 2:26:17.300\n before the deep learning revolution\n\n2:26:17.300 --> 2:26:19.500\n were taught with Lisp in mind.\n\n2:26:19.500 --> 2:26:20.340\n I don't know.\n\n2:26:20.340 --> 2:26:22.340\n I don't know what it is, but I'm stuck with it.\n\n2:26:22.340 --> 2:26:23.540\n But at the same time, like,\n\n2:26:23.540 --> 2:26:25.100\n why am I not using a modern ID\n\n2:26:25.100 --> 2:26:26.300\n for some of these programming?\n\n2:26:26.300 --> 2:26:27.260\n I don't know.\n\n2:26:27.260 --> 2:26:28.500\n They're not that much better.\n\n2:26:28.500 --> 2:26:30.180\n I've used modern IDs too.\n\n2:26:30.180 --> 2:26:32.040\n But at the same time, so to just,\n\n2:26:32.040 --> 2:26:33.060\n well, not to disagree with you,\n\n2:26:33.060 --> 2:26:35.880\n but like, I like multiple monitors.\n\n2:26:35.880 --> 2:26:38.380\n Like I have to do work on a laptop\n\n2:26:38.380 --> 2:26:41.340\n and it's a pain in the ass.\n\n2:26:41.340 --> 2:26:45.420\n And also I'm addicted to the Kinesis weird keyboard.\n\n2:26:45.420 --> 2:26:46.740\n You could see there.\n\n2:26:46.740 --> 2:26:48.540\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:26:48.540 --> 2:26:50.100\n Yeah, so you don't have any of that.\n\n2:26:50.100 --> 2:26:51.820\n You can just be on a MacBook.\n\n2:26:51.820 --> 2:26:53.020\n I mean, look at work.\n\n2:26:53.020 --> 2:26:55.220\n I have three 24 inch monitors.\n\n2:26:55.220 --> 2:26:56.580\n I have a happy hacking keyboard.\n\n2:26:56.580 --> 2:26:59.820\n I have a Razer Death Hatter mouse, like.\n\n2:26:59.820 --> 2:27:01.300\n But it's not essential for you.\n\n2:27:01.300 --> 2:27:02.120\n No.\n\n2:27:02.120 --> 2:27:04.680\n Let's go to a day in the life of George Hots.\n\n2:27:04.680 --> 2:27:08.780\n What is the perfect day productivity wise?\n\n2:27:08.780 --> 2:27:12.380\n So we're not talking about like Hunter S. Thompson drugs.\n\n2:27:12.380 --> 2:27:13.220\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:27:13.220 --> 2:27:16.420\n And let's look at productivity.\n\n2:27:16.420 --> 2:27:19.820\n Like what's the day look like, like hour by hour?\n\n2:27:19.820 --> 2:27:23.260\n Is there any regularities that create\n\n2:27:23.260 --> 2:27:25.940\n a magical George Hots experience?\n\n2:27:25.940 --> 2:27:28.300\n I can remember three days in my life.\n\n2:27:28.300 --> 2:27:30.300\n And I remember these days vividly\n\n2:27:30.300 --> 2:27:35.300\n when I've gone through kind of radical transformations\n\n2:27:36.620 --> 2:27:37.900\n to the way I think.\n\n2:27:37.900 --> 2:27:40.140\n And what I would give, I would pay $100,000\n\n2:27:40.140 --> 2:27:42.980\n if I could have one of these days tomorrow.\n\n2:27:42.980 --> 2:27:44.900\n The days have been so impactful.\n\n2:27:44.900 --> 2:27:47.780\n And one was first discovering Eliezer Yudkowsky\n\n2:27:47.780 --> 2:27:50.740\n on the singularity and reading that stuff.\n\n2:27:50.740 --> 2:27:52.780\n And like, you know, my mind was blown.\n\n2:27:54.260 --> 2:27:57.820\n The next was discovering the Hutter Prize\n\n2:27:57.820 --> 2:27:59.900\n and that AI is just compression.\n\n2:27:59.900 --> 2:28:03.820\n Like finally understanding AIXI and what all of that was.\n\n2:28:03.820 --> 2:28:05.300\n You know, I like read about it when I was 18, 19,\n\n2:28:05.300 --> 2:28:06.300\n I didn't understand it.\n\n2:28:06.300 --> 2:28:08.380\n And then the fact that like lossless compression\n\n2:28:08.380 --> 2:28:12.240\n implies intelligence, the day that I was shown that.\n\n2:28:12.240 --> 2:28:14.140\n And then the third one is controversial.\n\n2:28:14.140 --> 2:28:17.340\n The day I found a blog called Unqualified Reservations.\n\n2:28:17.340 --> 2:28:20.620\n And read that and I was like.\n\n2:28:20.620 --> 2:28:21.500\n Wait, which one is that?\n\n2:28:21.500 --> 2:28:22.980\n That's, what's the guy's name?\n\n2:28:22.980 --> 2:28:24.020\n Curtis Yarvin.\n\n2:28:24.020 --> 2:28:25.020\n Yeah.\n\n2:28:25.020 --> 2:28:27.640\n So many people tell me I'm supposed to talk to him.\n\n2:28:27.640 --> 2:28:28.480\n Yeah, the day.\n\n2:28:28.480 --> 2:28:30.140\n He looks, he sounds insane.\n\n2:28:30.140 --> 2:28:31.300\n Definitely. Or brilliant,\n\n2:28:31.300 --> 2:28:33.100\n but insane or both, I don't know.\n\n2:28:33.100 --> 2:28:35.140\n The day I found that blog was another like,\n\n2:28:35.140 --> 2:28:37.180\n this was during like Gamergate\n\n2:28:37.180 --> 2:28:39.020\n and kind of the run up to the 2016 election.\n\n2:28:39.020 --> 2:28:42.860\n And I'm like, wow, okay, the world makes sense now.\n\n2:28:42.860 --> 2:28:45.620\n This is like, I had a framework now to interpret this.\n\n2:28:45.620 --> 2:28:47.200\n Just like I got the framework for AI\n\n2:28:47.200 --> 2:28:49.420\n and a framework to interpret technological progress.\n\n2:28:49.420 --> 2:28:52.820\n Like those days when I discovered these new frameworks were.\n\n2:28:52.820 --> 2:28:53.660\n Oh, interesting.\n\n2:28:53.660 --> 2:28:57.160\n So it's not about, but what was special about those days?\n\n2:28:57.160 --> 2:28:58.780\n How did those days come to be?\n\n2:28:58.780 --> 2:28:59.980\n Is it just, you got lucky?\n\n2:28:59.980 --> 2:29:04.900\n Like, you just encountered a hotter prize\n\n2:29:04.900 --> 2:29:07.220\n on Hacker News or something like that?\n\n2:29:09.740 --> 2:29:11.840\n But you see, I don't think it's just,\n\n2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:13.260\n see, I don't think it's just that like,\n\n2:29:13.260 --> 2:29:14.820\n I could have gotten lucky at any point.\n\n2:29:14.820 --> 2:29:16.260\n I think that in a way.\n\n2:29:16.260 --> 2:29:17.820\n You were ready at that moment.\n\n2:29:17.820 --> 2:29:18.660\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:29:18.660 --> 2:29:19.960\n To receive the information.\n\n2:29:21.460 --> 2:29:24.300\n But is there some magic to the day today\n\n2:29:24.300 --> 2:29:27.220\n of like eating breakfast?\n\n2:29:27.220 --> 2:29:29.060\n And it's the mundane things.\n\n2:29:29.060 --> 2:29:29.900\n Nah.\n\n2:29:29.900 --> 2:29:30.720\n Nothing.\n\n2:29:30.720 --> 2:29:32.900\n Nah, I drift through life.\n\n2:29:32.900 --> 2:29:34.180\n Without structure.\n\n2:29:34.180 --> 2:29:36.220\n I drift through life hoping and praying\n\n2:29:36.220 --> 2:29:38.540\n that I will get another day like those days.\n\n2:29:38.540 --> 2:29:40.320\n And there's nothing in particular you do\n\n2:29:40.320 --> 2:29:44.740\n to be a receptacle for another, for day number four.\n\n2:29:46.060 --> 2:29:48.060\n No, I didn't do anything to get the other ones.\n\n2:29:48.060 --> 2:29:51.100\n So I don't think I have to really do anything now.\n\n2:29:51.100 --> 2:29:53.420\n I took a month long trip to New York\n\n2:29:53.420 --> 2:29:56.260\n and the Ethereum thing was the highlight of it,\n\n2:29:56.260 --> 2:29:57.980\n but the rest of it was pretty terrible.\n\n2:29:57.980 --> 2:29:59.860\n I did a two week road trip\n\n2:29:59.860 --> 2:30:01.740\n and I got, I had to turn around.\n\n2:30:01.740 --> 2:30:06.620\n I had to turn around driving in Gunnison, Colorado.\n\n2:30:06.620 --> 2:30:08.060\n I passed through Gunnison\n\n2:30:08.060 --> 2:30:10.660\n and the snow starts coming down.\n\n2:30:10.660 --> 2:30:12.160\n There's a pass up there called Monarch Pass\n\n2:30:12.160 --> 2:30:13.000\n in order to get through to Denver,\n\n2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:14.700\n you gotta get over the Rockies.\n\n2:30:14.700 --> 2:30:16.800\n And I had to turn my car around.\n\n2:30:16.800 --> 2:30:20.260\n I couldn't, I watched a F150 go off the road.\n\n2:30:20.260 --> 2:30:21.620\n I'm like, I gotta go back.\n\n2:30:21.620 --> 2:30:24.620\n And like that day was meaningful.\n\n2:30:24.620 --> 2:30:26.040\n Cause like, it was real.\n\n2:30:26.040 --> 2:30:28.900\n Like I actually had to turn my car around.\n\n2:30:28.900 --> 2:30:31.240\n It's rare that anything even real happens in my life.\n\n2:30:31.240 --> 2:30:34.300\n Even as, you know, mundane as the fact that,\n\n2:30:34.300 --> 2:30:36.100\n yeah, there was snow, I had to turn around,\n\n2:30:36.100 --> 2:30:37.700\n stay in Gunnison and leave the next day.\n\n2:30:37.700 --> 2:30:40.260\n Something about that moment felt real.\n\n2:30:40.260 --> 2:30:43.180\n Okay, so actually it's interesting to break apart\n\n2:30:43.180 --> 2:30:45.380\n the three moments you mentioned, if it's okay.\n\n2:30:45.380 --> 2:30:48.540\n So I always have trouble pronouncing his name,\n\n2:30:48.540 --> 2:30:50.620\n but Alousa Yurkowski.\n\n2:30:53.300 --> 2:30:57.820\n So what, how did your worldview change\n\n2:30:57.820 --> 2:31:02.820\n in starting to consider the exponential growth of AI\n\n2:31:02.900 --> 2:31:05.020\n and AGI that he thinks about\n\n2:31:05.020 --> 2:31:07.620\n and the threats of artificial intelligence\n\n2:31:07.620 --> 2:31:09.340\n and all that kind of ideas?\n\n2:31:09.340 --> 2:31:12.460\n Can you, is it just like, can you maybe break apart\n\n2:31:12.460 --> 2:31:15.660\n like what exactly was so magical to you?\n\n2:31:15.660 --> 2:31:17.380\n Is it transformational experience?\n\n2:31:17.380 --> 2:31:20.340\n Today, everyone knows him for threats and AI safety.\n\n2:31:20.340 --> 2:31:22.260\n This was pre that stuff.\n\n2:31:22.260 --> 2:31:25.980\n There was, I don't think a mention of AI safety on the page.\n\n2:31:25.980 --> 2:31:27.860\n This is, this is old Yurkowski stuff.\n\n2:31:27.860 --> 2:31:29.060\n He'd probably denounce it all now.\n\n2:31:29.060 --> 2:31:29.900\n He'd probably be like,\n\n2:31:29.900 --> 2:31:32.220\n that's exactly what I didn't want to happen.\n\n2:31:32.220 --> 2:31:33.060\n Sorry, man.\n\n2:31:33.060 --> 2:31:37.700\n Is there something specific you can take from his work\n\n2:31:37.700 --> 2:31:38.700\n that you can remember?\n\n2:31:38.700 --> 2:31:40.780\n Yeah, it was this realization\n\n2:31:40.780 --> 2:31:45.780\n that computers double in power every 18 months\n\n2:31:45.980 --> 2:31:50.140\n and humans do not, and they haven't crossed yet.\n\n2:31:50.140 --> 2:31:52.700\n But if you have one thing that's doubling every 18 months\n\n2:31:52.700 --> 2:31:55.100\n and one thing that's staying like this, you know,\n\n2:31:55.100 --> 2:31:58.940\n here's your log graph, here's your line, you know,\n\n2:31:58.940 --> 2:31:59.860\n calculate that.\n\n2:31:59.860 --> 2:32:03.540\n And then the data opened the door\n\n2:32:03.540 --> 2:32:06.420\n to the exponential thinking, like thinking that like,\n\n2:32:06.420 --> 2:32:07.740\n you know what, with technology,\n\n2:32:07.740 --> 2:32:11.580\n we can actually transform the world.\n\n2:32:11.580 --> 2:32:13.740\n It opened the door to human obsolescence.\n\n2:32:13.740 --> 2:32:16.980\n It opened the door to realize that in my lifetime,\n\n2:32:16.980 --> 2:32:19.740\n humans are going to be replaced.\n\n2:32:20.620 --> 2:32:23.740\n And then the matching idea to that of artificial intelligence\n\n2:32:23.740 --> 2:32:27.940\n with the Hutter prize, you know, I'm torn.\n\n2:32:27.940 --> 2:32:30.220\n I go back and forth on what I think about it.\n\n2:32:30.220 --> 2:32:31.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:32:31.380 --> 2:32:36.180\n But the basic thesis is it's a nice compelling notion\n\n2:32:36.180 --> 2:32:38.340\n that we can reduce the task of creating\n\n2:32:38.340 --> 2:32:41.380\n an intelligent system, a generally intelligent system\n\n2:32:41.380 --> 2:32:42.940\n into the task of compression.\n\n2:32:43.940 --> 2:32:46.300\n So you can think of all of intelligence in the universe,\n\n2:32:46.300 --> 2:32:48.500\n in fact, as a kind of compression.\n\n2:32:50.220 --> 2:32:52.420\n Do you find that, was that just at the time\n\n2:32:52.420 --> 2:32:53.900\n you found that as a compelling idea\n\n2:32:53.900 --> 2:32:56.980\n or do you still find that a compelling idea?\n\n2:32:56.980 --> 2:32:59.180\n I still find that a compelling idea.\n\n2:32:59.180 --> 2:33:02.180\n I think that it's not that useful day to day,\n\n2:33:02.180 --> 2:33:06.260\n but actually one of maybe my quests before that\n\n2:33:06.260 --> 2:33:09.340\n was a search for the definition of the word intelligence.\n\n2:33:09.340 --> 2:33:10.860\n And I never had one.\n\n2:33:10.860 --> 2:33:14.700\n And I definitely have a definition of the word compression.\n\n2:33:14.700 --> 2:33:18.420\n It's a very simple, straightforward one.\n\n2:33:18.420 --> 2:33:19.740\n And you know what compression is,\n\n2:33:19.740 --> 2:33:21.100\n you know what lossless, it's lossless compression,\n\n2:33:21.100 --> 2:33:22.940\n not lossy, lossless compression.\n\n2:33:22.940 --> 2:33:25.620\n And that that is equivalent to intelligence,\n\n2:33:25.620 --> 2:33:27.540\n which I believe, I'm not sure how useful\n\n2:33:27.540 --> 2:33:28.980\n that definition is day to day,\n\n2:33:28.980 --> 2:33:32.340\n but like I now have a framework to understand what it is.\n\n2:33:32.340 --> 2:33:36.300\n And he just 10X the prize for that competition\n\n2:33:36.300 --> 2:33:37.700\n like recently a few months ago.\n\n2:33:37.700 --> 2:33:39.580\n You ever thought of taking a crack at that?\n\n2:33:39.580 --> 2:33:41.100\n Oh, I did.\n\n2:33:41.100 --> 2:33:41.940\n Oh, I did.\n\n2:33:41.940 --> 2:33:44.660\n I spent the next, after I found the prize,\n\n2:33:44.660 --> 2:33:47.820\n I spent the next six months of my life trying it.\n\n2:33:47.820 --> 2:33:51.300\n And well, that's when I started learning everything about AI.\n\n2:33:51.300 --> 2:33:53.340\n And then I worked at Vicarious for a bit\n\n2:33:53.340 --> 2:33:55.340\n and then I read all the deep learning stuff.\n\n2:33:55.340 --> 2:33:58.460\n And I'm like, okay, now I like I'm caught up to modern AI.\n\n2:33:58.460 --> 2:33:59.300\n Wow.\n\n2:33:59.300 --> 2:34:01.380\n And I had a really good framework to put it all in\n\n2:34:01.380 --> 2:34:04.420\n from the compression stuff, right?\n\n2:34:04.420 --> 2:34:07.340\n Like some of the first deep learning models I played with\n\n2:34:07.340 --> 2:34:12.020\n were GPT basically, but before transformers,\n\n2:34:12.020 --> 2:34:17.020\n before it was still RNNs to do character prediction.\n\n2:34:17.900 --> 2:34:19.940\n But by the way, on the compression side,\n\n2:34:19.940 --> 2:34:22.940\n I mean, especially with neural networks,\n\n2:34:22.940 --> 2:34:25.500\n what do you make of the lossless requirement\n\n2:34:25.500 --> 2:34:26.540\n with the Hutter prize?\n\n2:34:26.540 --> 2:34:31.460\n So, you know, human intelligence and neural networks\n\n2:34:31.460 --> 2:34:33.300\n can probably compress stuff pretty well,\n\n2:34:33.300 --> 2:34:35.220\n but it would be lossy.\n\n2:34:35.220 --> 2:34:36.660\n It's imperfect.\n\n2:34:36.660 --> 2:34:37.860\n You can turn a lossy compression\n\n2:34:37.860 --> 2:34:39.620\n to a lossless compressor pretty easily\n\n2:34:39.620 --> 2:34:41.060\n using an arithmetic encoder, right?\n\n2:34:41.060 --> 2:34:42.540\n You can take an arithmetic encoder\n\n2:34:42.540 --> 2:34:45.980\n and you can just encode the noise with maximum efficiency.\n\n2:34:45.980 --> 2:34:46.820\n Right?\n\n2:34:46.820 --> 2:34:48.900\n So even if you can't predict exactly\n\n2:34:48.900 --> 2:34:50.460\n what the next character is,\n\n2:34:50.460 --> 2:34:52.500\n the better a probability distribution,\n\n2:34:52.500 --> 2:34:54.260\n you can put over the next character.\n\n2:34:54.260 --> 2:34:57.340\n You can then use an arithmetic encoder to, right?\n\n2:34:57.340 --> 2:34:59.300\n You don't have to know whether it's an E or an I,\n\n2:34:59.300 --> 2:35:01.060\n you just have to put good probabilities on them\n\n2:35:01.060 --> 2:35:03.020\n and then, you know, code those.\n\n2:35:03.020 --> 2:35:06.460\n And if you have, it's a bits of entropy thing, right?\n\n2:35:06.460 --> 2:35:07.740\n So let me, on that topic,\n\n2:35:07.740 --> 2:35:10.260\n it'd be interesting as a little side tour.\n\n2:35:10.260 --> 2:35:13.580\n What are your thoughts in this year about GPT3\n\n2:35:13.580 --> 2:35:16.140\n and these language models and these transformers?\n\n2:35:16.140 --> 2:35:20.660\n Is there something interesting to you as an AI researcher,\n\n2:35:20.660 --> 2:35:22.540\n or is there something interesting to you\n\n2:35:22.540 --> 2:35:24.740\n as an autonomous vehicle developer?\n\n2:35:24.740 --> 2:35:27.460\n Nah, I think it's overhyped.\n\n2:35:27.460 --> 2:35:29.020\n I mean, it's not, like, it's cool.\n\n2:35:29.020 --> 2:35:30.820\n It's cool for what it is, but no,\n\n2:35:30.820 --> 2:35:33.500\n we're not just gonna be able to scale up to GPT12\n\n2:35:33.500 --> 2:35:35.340\n and get general purpose intelligence.\n\n2:35:35.340 --> 2:35:38.700\n Like, your loss function is literally just,\n\n2:35:38.700 --> 2:35:41.460\n you know, cross entropy loss on the character, right?\n\n2:35:41.460 --> 2:35:44.860\n Like, that's not the loss function of general intelligence.\n\n2:35:44.860 --> 2:35:45.940\n Is that obvious to you?\n\n2:35:45.940 --> 2:35:47.380\n Yes.\n\n2:35:47.380 --> 2:35:51.460\n Can you imagine that, like,\n\n2:35:51.460 --> 2:35:53.300\n to play devil's advocate on yourself,\n\n2:35:53.300 --> 2:35:55.860\n is it possible that you can,\n\n2:35:55.860 --> 2:35:58.580\n the GPT12 will achieve general intelligence\n\n2:35:58.580 --> 2:36:01.980\n with something as dumb as this kind of loss function?\n\n2:36:01.980 --> 2:36:05.060\n I guess it depends what you mean by general intelligence.\n\n2:36:05.060 --> 2:36:07.860\n So there's another problem with the GPTs,\n\n2:36:07.860 --> 2:36:11.060\n and that's that they don't have a,\n\n2:36:11.060 --> 2:36:13.020\n they don't have longterm memory.\n\n2:36:13.020 --> 2:36:13.860\n Right.\n\n2:36:13.860 --> 2:36:18.580\n So, like, just GPT12,\n\n2:36:18.580 --> 2:36:22.460\n a scaled up version of GPT2 or GPT3,\n\n2:36:22.460 --> 2:36:26.060\n I find it hard to believe.\n\n2:36:26.060 --> 2:36:28.780\n Well, you can scale it in,\n\n2:36:28.780 --> 2:36:32.060\n so it's a hard coded length,\n\n2:36:32.060 --> 2:36:34.300\n but you can make it wider and wider and wider.\n\n2:36:34.300 --> 2:36:36.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:36:36.380 --> 2:36:40.820\n You're gonna get cool things from those systems,\n\n2:36:40.820 --> 2:36:44.820\n but I don't think you're ever gonna get something\n\n2:36:44.820 --> 2:36:47.580\n that can, like, you know, build me a rocket ship.\n\n2:36:47.580 --> 2:36:49.420\n What about solved driving?\n\n2:36:49.420 --> 2:36:53.140\n So, you know, you can use Transformer with video,\n\n2:36:53.140 --> 2:36:54.740\n for example.\n\n2:36:54.740 --> 2:36:57.220\n You think, is there something in there?\n\n2:36:57.220 --> 2:37:01.260\n No, because, I mean, look, we use a GRU.\n\n2:37:01.260 --> 2:37:02.100\n We use a GRU.\n\n2:37:02.100 --> 2:37:04.140\n We could change that GRU out to a Transformer.\n\n2:37:05.900 --> 2:37:09.500\n I think driving is much more Markovian than language.\n\n2:37:09.500 --> 2:37:11.460\n So, Markovian, you mean, like, the memory,\n\n2:37:11.460 --> 2:37:13.660\n which aspect of Markovian?\n\n2:37:13.660 --> 2:37:16.340\n I mean that, like, most of the information\n\n2:37:16.340 --> 2:37:19.540\n in the state at T minus one is also in state T.\n\n2:37:19.540 --> 2:37:20.380\n I see, yeah.\n\n2:37:20.380 --> 2:37:22.820\n Right, and it kind of, like, drops off nicely like this,\n\n2:37:22.820 --> 2:37:23.900\n whereas sometime with language,\n\n2:37:23.900 --> 2:37:25.900\n you have to refer back to the third paragraph\n\n2:37:25.900 --> 2:37:27.260\n on the second page.\n\n2:37:27.260 --> 2:37:28.140\n I feel like.\n\n2:37:28.140 --> 2:37:30.060\n There's not many, like, you can say, like,\n\n2:37:30.060 --> 2:37:32.420\n speed limit signs, but there's really not many things\n\n2:37:32.420 --> 2:37:33.860\n in autonomous driving that look like that.\n\n2:37:33.860 --> 2:37:37.140\n But if you look at, to play devil's advocate,\n\n2:37:37.140 --> 2:37:39.740\n is the risk estimation thing that you've talked about\n\n2:37:39.740 --> 2:37:41.180\n is kind of interesting.\n\n2:37:41.180 --> 2:37:45.700\n Is, it feels like there might be some longer term\n\n2:37:45.700 --> 2:37:49.020\n aggregation of context necessary to be able to figure out,\n\n2:37:49.020 --> 2:37:51.900\n like, the context.\n\n2:37:51.900 --> 2:37:55.820\n Yeah, I'm not even sure I'm believing my devil's advocate.\n\n2:37:55.820 --> 2:37:58.260\n We have a nice, like, vision model,\n\n2:37:58.260 --> 2:38:00.180\n which outputs, like, a one or two,\n\n2:38:00.180 --> 2:38:02.100\n four dimensional perception space.\n\n2:38:03.300 --> 2:38:04.740\n Can I try Transformers on it?\n\n2:38:04.740 --> 2:38:06.580\n Sure, I probably will.\n\n2:38:06.580 --> 2:38:08.260\n At some point, we'll try Transformers,\n\n2:38:08.260 --> 2:38:09.100\n and then we'll just see.\n\n2:38:09.100 --> 2:38:09.940\n Do they do better?\n\n2:38:09.940 --> 2:38:10.780\n Sure, I'm.\n\n2:38:10.780 --> 2:38:12.180\n But it might not be a game changer, you're saying?\n\n2:38:12.180 --> 2:38:13.020\n No, well, I'm not.\n\n2:38:13.020 --> 2:38:15.300\n Like, might Transformers work better than GRUs\n\n2:38:15.300 --> 2:38:16.140\n for autonomous driving?\n\n2:38:16.140 --> 2:38:16.980\n Sure.\n\n2:38:16.980 --> 2:38:17.820\n Might we switch?\n\n2:38:17.820 --> 2:38:18.660\n Sure.\n\n2:38:18.660 --> 2:38:19.500\n Is this some radical change?\n\n2:38:19.500 --> 2:38:20.340\n No.\n\n2:38:20.340 --> 2:38:21.540\n Okay, we use a slightly different,\n\n2:38:21.540 --> 2:38:23.020\n you know, we switch from RNNs to GRUs.\n\n2:38:23.020 --> 2:38:24.980\n Like, okay, maybe it's GRUs to Transformers,\n\n2:38:24.980 --> 2:38:26.540\n but no, it's not.\n\n2:38:26.540 --> 2:38:27.900\n Yeah.\n\n2:38:27.900 --> 2:38:30.500\n Well, on the topic of general intelligence,\n\n2:38:30.500 --> 2:38:32.140\n I don't know how much I've talked to you about it.\n\n2:38:32.140 --> 2:38:36.540\n Like, what, do you think we'll actually build\n\n2:38:36.540 --> 2:38:38.060\n an AGI?\n\n2:38:38.060 --> 2:38:40.740\n Like, if you look at Ray Kurzweil with Singularity,\n\n2:38:40.740 --> 2:38:43.380\n do you have like an intuition about,\n\n2:38:43.380 --> 2:38:45.420\n you're kind of saying driving is easy.\n\n2:38:45.420 --> 2:38:46.260\n Yeah.\n\n2:38:46.260 --> 2:38:51.260\n And I tend to personally believe that solving driving\n\n2:38:52.500 --> 2:38:56.580\n will have really deep, important impacts\n\n2:38:56.580 --> 2:38:59.300\n on our ability to solve general intelligence.\n\n2:38:59.300 --> 2:39:03.380\n Like, I think driving doesn't require general intelligence,\n\n2:39:03.380 --> 2:39:05.220\n but I think they're going to be neighbors\n\n2:39:05.220 --> 2:39:08.380\n in a way that it's like deeply tied.\n\n2:39:08.380 --> 2:39:11.540\n Cause it's so, like driving is so deeply connected\n\n2:39:11.540 --> 2:39:15.020\n to the human experience that I think solving one\n\n2:39:15.020 --> 2:39:17.420\n will help solve the other.\n\n2:39:17.420 --> 2:39:20.980\n But, so I don't see, I don't see driving as like easy\n\n2:39:20.980 --> 2:39:23.540\n and almost like separate than general intelligence,\n\n2:39:23.540 --> 2:39:26.700\n but like, what's your vision of a future with a Singularity?\n\n2:39:26.700 --> 2:39:28.180\n Do you see there'll be a single moment,\n\n2:39:28.180 --> 2:39:30.620\n like a Singularity where it'll be a phase shift?\n\n2:39:30.620 --> 2:39:32.380\n Are we in the Singularity now?\n\n2:39:32.380 --> 2:39:34.540\n Like what, do you have crazy ideas about the future\n\n2:39:34.540 --> 2:39:35.740\n in terms of AGI?\n\n2:39:35.740 --> 2:39:38.020\n We're definitely in the Singularity now.\n\n2:39:38.020 --> 2:39:38.860\n We are?\n\n2:39:38.860 --> 2:39:40.180\n Of course, of course.\n\n2:39:40.180 --> 2:39:41.500\n Look at the bandwidth between people.\n\n2:39:41.500 --> 2:39:43.900\n The bandwidth between people goes up, right?\n\n2:39:44.820 --> 2:39:47.300\n The Singularity is just, you know, when the bandwidth, but.\n\n2:39:47.300 --> 2:39:48.620\n What do you mean by the bandwidth of people?\n\n2:39:48.620 --> 2:39:51.340\n Communications, tools, the whole world is networked.\n\n2:39:51.340 --> 2:39:52.260\n The whole world is networked\n\n2:39:52.260 --> 2:39:54.740\n and we raise the speed of that network, right?\n\n2:39:54.740 --> 2:39:57.380\n Oh, so you think the communication of information\n\n2:39:57.380 --> 2:40:00.980\n in a distributed way is an empowering thing\n\n2:40:00.980 --> 2:40:02.300\n for collective intelligence?\n\n2:40:02.300 --> 2:40:03.660\n Oh, I didn't say it's necessarily a good thing,\n\n2:40:03.660 --> 2:40:04.540\n but I think that's like,\n\n2:40:04.540 --> 2:40:06.500\n when I think of the definition of the Singularity,\n\n2:40:06.500 --> 2:40:08.180\n yeah, it seems kind of right.\n\n2:40:08.180 --> 2:40:12.060\n I see, like it's a change in the world\n\n2:40:12.060 --> 2:40:14.940\n beyond which like the world be transformed\n\n2:40:14.940 --> 2:40:16.780\n in ways that we can't possibly imagine.\n\n2:40:16.780 --> 2:40:18.380\n No, I mean, I think we're in the Singularity now\n\n2:40:18.380 --> 2:40:19.700\n in the sense that there's like, you know,\n\n2:40:19.700 --> 2:40:22.340\n one world and a monoculture and it's also linked.\n\n2:40:22.340 --> 2:40:24.800\n Yeah, I mean, I kind of share the intuition\n\n2:40:24.800 --> 2:40:27.700\n that the Singularity will originate\n\n2:40:27.700 --> 2:40:31.220\n from the collective intelligence of us ands\n\n2:40:31.220 --> 2:40:35.340\n versus the like some single system AGI type thing.\n\n2:40:35.340 --> 2:40:37.020\n Oh, I totally agree with that.\n\n2:40:37.020 --> 2:40:40.460\n Yeah, I don't really believe in like a hard take off AGI\n\n2:40:40.460 --> 2:40:41.300\n kind of thing.\n\n2:40:45.140 --> 2:40:49.500\n Yeah, I don't even think AI is all that different in kind\n\n2:40:49.500 --> 2:40:52.060\n from what we've already been building.\n\n2:40:52.060 --> 2:40:53.380\n With respect to driving,\n\n2:40:53.380 --> 2:40:56.340\n I think driving is a subset of general intelligence\n\n2:40:56.340 --> 2:40:58.060\n and I think it's a pretty complete subset.\n\n2:40:58.060 --> 2:41:00.300\n I think the tools we develop at Kama\n\n2:41:00.300 --> 2:41:02.300\n will also be extremely helpful\n\n2:41:02.300 --> 2:41:04.020\n to solving general intelligence\n\n2:41:04.020 --> 2:41:06.620\n and that's I think the real reason why I'm doing it.\n\n2:41:06.620 --> 2:41:08.420\n I don't care about self driving cars.\n\n2:41:08.420 --> 2:41:10.920\n It's a cool problem to beat people at.\n\n2:41:10.920 --> 2:41:14.540\n But yeah, I mean, yeah, you're kind of, you're of two minds.\n\n2:41:14.540 --> 2:41:16.340\n So one, you do have to have a mission\n\n2:41:16.340 --> 2:41:19.020\n and you wanna focus and make sure you get there.\n\n2:41:19.020 --> 2:41:22.280\n You can't forget that but at the same time,\n\n2:41:22.280 --> 2:41:26.060\n there is a thread that's much bigger\n\n2:41:26.060 --> 2:41:28.460\n than that connects the entirety of your effort.\n\n2:41:28.460 --> 2:41:31.180\n That's much bigger than just driving.\n\n2:41:31.180 --> 2:41:33.380\n With AI and with general intelligence,\n\n2:41:33.380 --> 2:41:35.220\n it is so easy to delude yourself\n\n2:41:35.220 --> 2:41:37.300\n into thinking you've figured something out when you haven't.\n\n2:41:37.300 --> 2:41:39.820\n If we build a level five self driving car,\n\n2:41:39.820 --> 2:41:42.660\n we have indisputably built something.\n\n2:41:42.660 --> 2:41:43.500\n Yeah.\n\n2:41:43.500 --> 2:41:44.800\n Is it general intelligence?\n\n2:41:44.800 --> 2:41:45.940\n I'm not gonna debate that.\n\n2:41:45.940 --> 2:41:47.520\n I will say we've built something\n\n2:41:47.520 --> 2:41:49.740\n that provides huge financial value.\n\n2:41:49.740 --> 2:41:50.580\n Yeah, beautifully put.\n\n2:41:50.580 --> 2:41:51.940\n That's the engineering credo.\n\n2:41:51.940 --> 2:41:53.660\n Like just build the thing.\n\n2:41:53.660 --> 2:41:57.120\n It's like, that's why I'm with Elon\n\n2:41:57.120 --> 2:41:58.780\n on go to Mars.\n\n2:41:58.780 --> 2:41:59.740\n Yeah, that's a great one.\n\n2:41:59.740 --> 2:42:03.700\n You can argue like who the hell cares about going to Mars.\n\n2:42:03.700 --> 2:42:07.220\n But the reality is set that as a mission, get it done.\n\n2:42:07.220 --> 2:42:08.060\n Yeah.\n\n2:42:08.060 --> 2:42:09.540\n And then you're going to crack some problem\n\n2:42:09.540 --> 2:42:11.580\n that you've never even expected\n\n2:42:11.580 --> 2:42:13.900\n in the process of doing that, yeah.\n\n2:42:13.900 --> 2:42:16.220\n Yeah, I mean, no, I think if I had a choice\n\n2:42:16.220 --> 2:42:17.460\n between humanity going to Mars\n\n2:42:17.460 --> 2:42:18.500\n and solving self driving cars,\n\n2:42:18.500 --> 2:42:21.900\n I think going to Mars is better, but I don't know.\n\n2:42:21.900 --> 2:42:23.580\n I'm more suited for self driving cars.\n\n2:42:23.580 --> 2:42:24.420\n I'm an information guy.\n\n2:42:24.420 --> 2:42:26.540\n I'm not a modernist, I'm a postmodernist.\n\n2:42:26.540 --> 2:42:29.620\n Postmodernist, all right, beautifully put.\n\n2:42:29.620 --> 2:42:32.220\n Let me drag you back to programming for a sec.\n\n2:42:32.220 --> 2:42:35.140\n What three, maybe three to five programming languages\n\n2:42:35.140 --> 2:42:36.580\n should people learn, do you think?\n\n2:42:36.580 --> 2:42:38.220\n Like if you look at yourself,\n\n2:42:38.220 --> 2:42:41.860\n what did you get the most out of from learning?\n\n2:42:42.700 --> 2:42:45.980\n Well, so everybody should learn C and assembly.\n\n2:42:45.980 --> 2:42:47.380\n We'll start with those two, right?\n\n2:42:47.380 --> 2:42:48.220\n Assembly?\n\n2:42:48.220 --> 2:42:49.940\n Yeah, if you can't code an assembly,\n\n2:42:49.940 --> 2:42:51.720\n you don't know what the computer's doing.\n\n2:42:51.720 --> 2:42:53.340\n You don't understand like,\n\n2:42:53.340 --> 2:42:54.820\n you don't have to be great in assembly,\n\n2:42:54.820 --> 2:42:56.580\n but you have to code in it.\n\n2:42:56.580 --> 2:42:58.940\n And then like, you have to appreciate assembly\n\n2:42:58.940 --> 2:43:02.020\n in order to appreciate all the great things C gets you.\n\n2:43:02.020 --> 2:43:03.380\n And then you have to code in C\n\n2:43:03.380 --> 2:43:06.340\n in order to appreciate all the great things Python gets you.\n\n2:43:06.340 --> 2:43:07.860\n So I'll just say assembly C and Python,\n\n2:43:07.860 --> 2:43:09.740\n we'll start with those three.\n\n2:43:09.740 --> 2:43:14.700\n The memory allocation of C and the fact that,\n\n2:43:14.700 --> 2:43:16.340\n so assembly gives you a sense\n\n2:43:16.340 --> 2:43:18.460\n of just how many levels of abstraction\n\n2:43:18.460 --> 2:43:20.660\n you get to work on in modern day programming.\n\n2:43:20.660 --> 2:43:22.900\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, graph coloring for assignment,\n\n2:43:22.900 --> 2:43:24.740\n register assignment and compilers.\n\n2:43:24.740 --> 2:43:25.940\n Like, you know, you gotta do,\n\n2:43:25.940 --> 2:43:26.780\n you know, the compiler,\n\n2:43:26.780 --> 2:43:28.340\n the computer only has a certain number of registers,\n\n2:43:28.340 --> 2:43:31.140\n yet you can have all the variables you want in a C function.\n\n2:43:31.140 --> 2:43:34.460\n So you get to start to build intuition about compilation,\n\n2:43:34.460 --> 2:43:35.960\n like what a compiler gets you.\n\n2:43:37.380 --> 2:43:38.500\n What else?\n\n2:43:38.500 --> 2:43:41.220\n Well, then there's kind of a,\n\n2:43:41.220 --> 2:43:44.220\n so those are all very imperative programming languages.\n\n2:43:45.800 --> 2:43:47.700\n Then there's two other paradigms for programming\n\n2:43:47.700 --> 2:43:49.220\n that everybody should be familiar with.\n\n2:43:49.220 --> 2:43:51.260\n And one of them is functional.\n\n2:43:51.260 --> 2:43:54.140\n You should learn Haskell and take that all the way through,\n\n2:43:54.140 --> 2:43:57.260\n learn a language with dependent types like Coq,\n\n2:43:57.260 --> 2:43:58.980\n learn that whole space,\n\n2:43:58.980 --> 2:44:02.740\n like the very PL theory, heavy languages.\n\n2:44:02.740 --> 2:44:04.860\n And Haskell is your favorite functional?\n\n2:44:04.860 --> 2:44:06.500\n Is that the go to, you'd say?\n\n2:44:06.500 --> 2:44:08.580\n Yeah, I'm not a great Haskell programmer.\n\n2:44:08.580 --> 2:44:10.580\n I wrote a compiler in Haskell once.\n\n2:44:10.580 --> 2:44:11.460\n There's another paradigm,\n\n2:44:11.460 --> 2:44:12.540\n and actually there's one more paradigm\n\n2:44:12.540 --> 2:44:14.180\n that I'll even talk about after that,\n\n2:44:14.180 --> 2:44:15.100\n that I never used to talk about\n\n2:44:15.100 --> 2:44:15.940\n when I would think about this,\n\n2:44:15.940 --> 2:44:18.440\n but the next paradigm is learn Verilog of HDL.\n\n2:44:20.240 --> 2:44:22.280\n Understand this idea of all of the instructions\n\n2:44:22.280 --> 2:44:26.860\n execute at once. If I have a block in Verilog\n\n2:44:26.860 --> 2:44:29.900\n and I write stuff in it, it's not sequential.\n\n2:44:29.900 --> 2:44:31.300\n They all execute at once.\n\n2:44:33.740 --> 2:44:36.700\n And then think like that, that's how hardware works.\n\n2:44:36.700 --> 2:44:40.020\n To be, so I guess assembly doesn't quite get you that.\n\n2:44:40.020 --> 2:44:42.260\n Assembly is more about compilation,\n\n2:44:42.260 --> 2:44:44.260\n and Verilog is more about the hardware,\n\n2:44:44.260 --> 2:44:46.420\n like giving a sense of what actually\n\n2:44:46.420 --> 2:44:48.580\n is the hardware is doing.\n\n2:44:48.580 --> 2:44:50.480\n Assembly, C, Python are straight,\n\n2:44:50.480 --> 2:44:52.420\n like they sit right on top of each other.\n\n2:44:52.420 --> 2:44:55.660\n In fact, C is, well, C is kind of coded in C,\n\n2:44:55.660 --> 2:44:57.900\n but you could imagine the first C was coded in assembly,\n\n2:44:57.900 --> 2:45:00.020\n and Python is actually coded in C.\n\n2:45:00.020 --> 2:45:02.500\n So you can straight up go on that.\n\n2:45:03.620 --> 2:45:06.940\n Got it, and then Verilog gives you, that's brilliant.\n\n2:45:06.940 --> 2:45:07.780\n Okay.\n\n2:45:07.780 --> 2:45:09.820\n And then I think there's another one now.\n\n2:45:09.820 --> 2:45:12.660\n Everyone, Carpathia calls it programming 2.0,\n\n2:45:12.660 --> 2:45:16.500\n which is learn a, I'm not even gonna,\n\n2:45:16.500 --> 2:45:18.620\n don't learn TensorFlow, learn PyTorch.\n\n2:45:18.620 --> 2:45:20.180\n So machine learning.\n\n2:45:20.180 --> 2:45:21.540\n We've got to come up with a better term\n\n2:45:21.540 --> 2:45:26.100\n than programming 2.0, or, but yeah.\n\n2:45:26.100 --> 2:45:28.060\n It's a programming language, learn it.\n\n2:45:29.900 --> 2:45:32.660\n I wonder if it can be formalized a little bit better.\n\n2:45:32.660 --> 2:45:34.900\n It feels like we're in the early days\n\n2:45:34.900 --> 2:45:37.100\n of what that actually entails.\n\n2:45:37.100 --> 2:45:39.220\n Data driven programming?\n\n2:45:39.220 --> 2:45:41.700\n Data driven programming, yeah.\n\n2:45:41.700 --> 2:45:43.080\n But it's so fundamentally different\n\n2:45:43.080 --> 2:45:44.900\n as a paradigm than the others.\n\n2:45:44.900 --> 2:45:49.900\n Like it almost requires a different skillset.\n\n2:45:50.420 --> 2:45:52.020\n But you think it's still, yeah.\n\n2:45:53.740 --> 2:45:56.580\n And PyTorch versus TensorFlow, PyTorch wins.\n\n2:45:56.580 --> 2:45:57.460\n It's the fourth paradigm.\n\n2:45:57.460 --> 2:45:59.380\n It's the fourth paradigm that I've kind of seen.\n\n2:45:59.380 --> 2:46:01.460\n There's like this, you know,\n\n2:46:01.460 --> 2:46:04.840\n imperative functional hardware.\n\n2:46:04.840 --> 2:46:06.340\n I don't know a better word for it.\n\n2:46:06.340 --> 2:46:07.300\n And then ML.\n\n2:46:08.180 --> 2:46:13.180\n Do you have advice for people that wanna,\n\n2:46:13.180 --> 2:46:16.180\n you know, get into programming, wanna learn programming?\n\n2:46:16.180 --> 2:46:18.200\n You have a video,\n\n2:46:19.940 --> 2:46:22.860\n what is programming noob lessons, exclamation point.\n\n2:46:22.860 --> 2:46:24.620\n And I think the top comment is like,\n\n2:46:24.620 --> 2:46:26.520\n warning, this is not for noobs.\n\n2:46:27.820 --> 2:46:32.560\n Do you have a noob, like a TLDW for that video,\n\n2:46:32.560 --> 2:46:37.560\n but also a noob friendly advice\n\n2:46:38.020 --> 2:46:39.540\n on how to get into programming?\n\n2:46:39.540 --> 2:46:41.400\n We're never going to learn programming\n\n2:46:41.400 --> 2:46:44.640\n by watching a video called Learn Programming.\n\n2:46:44.640 --> 2:46:46.660\n The only way to learn programming, I think,\n\n2:46:46.660 --> 2:46:48.060\n and the only one is that the only way\n\n2:46:48.060 --> 2:46:50.140\n everyone I've ever met who can program well,\n\n2:46:50.140 --> 2:46:51.940\n learned it all in the same way.\n\n2:46:51.940 --> 2:46:53.740\n They had something they wanted to do\n\n2:46:54.960 --> 2:46:56.580\n and then they tried to do it.\n\n2:46:56.580 --> 2:47:00.020\n And then they were like, oh, well, okay.\n\n2:47:00.020 --> 2:47:01.380\n This is kind of, you know, it'd be nice\n\n2:47:01.380 --> 2:47:02.740\n if the computer could kind of do this.\n\n2:47:02.740 --> 2:47:04.440\n And then, you know, that's how you learn.\n\n2:47:04.440 --> 2:47:06.520\n You just keep pushing on a project.\n\n2:47:09.020 --> 2:47:10.900\n So the only advice I have for learning programming\n\n2:47:10.900 --> 2:47:12.140\n is go program.\n\n2:47:12.140 --> 2:47:14.680\n Somebody wrote to me a question like,\n\n2:47:14.680 --> 2:47:17.100\n we don't really, they're looking to learn\n\n2:47:17.100 --> 2:47:19.060\n about recurring neural networks.\n\n2:47:19.060 --> 2:47:20.540\n And he's saying, like, my company's thinking\n\n2:47:20.540 --> 2:47:24.140\n of using recurring neural networks for time series data,\n\n2:47:24.140 --> 2:47:27.420\n but we don't really have an idea of where to use it yet.\n\n2:47:27.420 --> 2:47:28.980\n We just want to, like, do you have any advice\n\n2:47:28.980 --> 2:47:31.780\n on how to learn about, these are these kind of\n\n2:47:31.780 --> 2:47:33.340\n general machine learning questions.\n\n2:47:33.340 --> 2:47:36.780\n And I think the answer is, like,\n\n2:47:36.780 --> 2:47:39.020\n actually have a problem that you're trying to solve.\n\n2:47:39.020 --> 2:47:40.220\n And just.\n\n2:47:40.220 --> 2:47:41.220\n I see that stuff.\n\n2:47:41.220 --> 2:47:42.660\n Oh my God, when people talk like that,\n\n2:47:42.660 --> 2:47:45.500\n they're like, I heard machine learning is important.\n\n2:47:45.500 --> 2:47:47.500\n Could you help us integrate machine learning\n\n2:47:47.500 --> 2:47:49.580\n with macaroni and cheese production?\n\n2:47:51.300 --> 2:47:54.000\n You just, I don't even, you can't help these people.\n\n2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:55.980\n Like, who lets you run anything?\n\n2:47:55.980 --> 2:47:58.400\n Who lets that kind of person run anything?\n\n2:47:58.400 --> 2:48:02.620\n I think we're all, we're all beginners at some point.\n\n2:48:02.620 --> 2:48:03.460\n So.\n\n2:48:03.460 --> 2:48:04.860\n It's not like they're a beginner.\n\n2:48:04.860 --> 2:48:07.340\n It's like, my problem is not that they don't know\n\n2:48:07.340 --> 2:48:08.620\n about machine learning.\n\n2:48:08.620 --> 2:48:10.840\n My problem is that they think that machine learning\n\n2:48:10.840 --> 2:48:13.740\n has something to say about macaroni and cheese production.\n\n2:48:14.740 --> 2:48:17.020\n Or like, I heard about this new technology.\n\n2:48:17.020 --> 2:48:19.020\n How can I use it for why?\n\n2:48:19.860 --> 2:48:23.500\n Like, I don't know what it is, but how can I use it for why?\n\n2:48:23.500 --> 2:48:24.340\n That's true.\n\n2:48:24.340 --> 2:48:26.140\n You have to build up an intuition of how,\n\n2:48:26.140 --> 2:48:27.620\n cause you might be able to figure out a way,\n\n2:48:27.620 --> 2:48:29.300\n but like the prerequisites,\n\n2:48:29.300 --> 2:48:32.300\n you should have a macaroni and cheese problem to solve first.\n\n2:48:32.300 --> 2:48:33.460\n Exactly.\n\n2:48:33.460 --> 2:48:36.940\n And then two, you should have more traditional,\n\n2:48:36.940 --> 2:48:39.340\n like the learning process should involve\n\n2:48:39.340 --> 2:48:41.940\n more traditionally applicable problems\n\n2:48:41.940 --> 2:48:44.540\n in the space of whatever that is, machine learning,\n\n2:48:44.540 --> 2:48:47.060\n and then see if it can be applied to mac and cheese.\n\n2:48:47.060 --> 2:48:49.180\n At least start with, tell me about a problem.\n\n2:48:49.180 --> 2:48:50.740\n Like if you have a problem, you're like,\n\n2:48:50.740 --> 2:48:52.500\n you know, some of my boxes aren't getting\n\n2:48:52.500 --> 2:48:54.500\n enough macaroni in them.\n\n2:48:54.500 --> 2:48:56.820\n Can we use machine learning to solve this problem?\n\n2:48:56.820 --> 2:48:59.380\n That's much, much better than how do I apply\n\n2:48:59.380 --> 2:49:01.600\n machine learning to macaroni and cheese?\n\n2:49:01.600 --> 2:49:05.380\n One big thing, maybe this is me talking\n\n2:49:05.380 --> 2:49:07.860\n to the audience a little bit, cause I get these days\n\n2:49:07.860 --> 2:49:12.860\n so many messages, advice on how to like learn stuff, okay?\n\n2:49:15.060 --> 2:49:18.160\n My, this is not me being mean.\n\n2:49:18.160 --> 2:49:20.540\n I think this is quite profound actually,\n\n2:49:20.540 --> 2:49:22.780\n is you should Google it.\n\n2:49:22.780 --> 2:49:23.820\n Oh yeah.\n\n2:49:23.820 --> 2:49:28.820\n Like one of the like skills that you should really acquire\n\n2:49:29.700 --> 2:49:33.100\n as an engineer, as a researcher, as a thinker,\n\n2:49:33.100 --> 2:49:36.660\n like one, there's two complementary skills.\n\n2:49:36.660 --> 2:49:39.100\n Like one is with a blank sheet of paper\n\n2:49:39.100 --> 2:49:41.660\n with no internet to think deeply.\n\n2:49:41.660 --> 2:49:44.740\n And then the other is to Google the crap\n\n2:49:44.740 --> 2:49:45.940\n out of the questions you have.\n\n2:49:45.940 --> 2:49:49.180\n Like that's actually a skill people often talk about,\n\n2:49:49.180 --> 2:49:52.020\n but like doing research, like pulling at the thread,\n\n2:49:52.020 --> 2:49:53.860\n like looking up different words,\n\n2:49:53.860 --> 2:49:58.060\n going into like GitHub repositories with two stars\n\n2:49:58.060 --> 2:49:59.700\n and like looking how they did stuff,\n\n2:49:59.700 --> 2:50:03.460\n like looking at the code or going on Twitter,\n\n2:50:03.460 --> 2:50:05.780\n seeing like there's little pockets of brilliant people\n\n2:50:05.780 --> 2:50:07.620\n that are like having discussions.\n\n2:50:07.620 --> 2:50:09.860\n Like if you're a neuroscientist,\n\n2:50:09.860 --> 2:50:11.620\n go into signal processing community.\n\n2:50:11.620 --> 2:50:15.860\n If you're an AI person going into the psychology community,\n\n2:50:15.860 --> 2:50:18.020\n like switch communities.\n\n2:50:18.020 --> 2:50:19.980\n I keep searching, searching, searching,\n\n2:50:19.980 --> 2:50:23.860\n because it's so much better to invest\n\n2:50:23.860 --> 2:50:27.260\n in like finding somebody else who already solved your problem\n\n2:50:27.260 --> 2:50:30.900\n than it is to try to solve the problem.\n\n2:50:30.900 --> 2:50:34.380\n And because they've often invested years of their life,\n\n2:50:34.380 --> 2:50:37.420\n like entire communities are probably already out there\n\n2:50:37.420 --> 2:50:39.180\n who have tried to solve your problem.\n\n2:50:39.180 --> 2:50:40.980\n I think they're the same thing.\n\n2:50:40.980 --> 2:50:44.180\n I think you go try to solve the problem.\n\n2:50:44.180 --> 2:50:46.180\n And then in trying to solve the problem,\n\n2:50:46.180 --> 2:50:47.740\n if you're good at solving problems,\n\n2:50:47.740 --> 2:50:50.260\n you'll stumble upon the person who solved it already.\n\n2:50:50.260 --> 2:50:52.300\n But the stumbling is really important.\n\n2:50:52.300 --> 2:50:54.260\n I think that's a skill that people should really put,\n\n2:50:54.260 --> 2:50:57.700\n especially in undergrad, like search.\n\n2:50:57.700 --> 2:50:58.700\n If you ask me a question,\n\n2:50:58.700 --> 2:51:02.180\n how should I get started in deep learning, like especially?\n\n2:51:04.100 --> 2:51:07.260\n Like that is just so Googleable.\n\n2:51:07.260 --> 2:51:10.060\n Like the whole point is you Google that\n\n2:51:10.060 --> 2:51:13.980\n and you get a million pages and just start looking at them.\n\n2:51:13.980 --> 2:51:16.420\n Start pulling at the threads, start exploring,\n\n2:51:16.420 --> 2:51:19.300\n start taking notes, start getting advice\n\n2:51:19.300 --> 2:51:22.820\n from a million people that already like spent their life\n\n2:51:22.820 --> 2:51:25.060\n answering that question, actually.\n\n2:51:25.060 --> 2:51:26.460\n Oh, well, yeah, I mean, that's definitely also, yeah,\n\n2:51:26.460 --> 2:51:28.500\n when people like ask me things like that, I'm like, trust me,\n\n2:51:28.500 --> 2:51:30.340\n the top answer on Google is much, much better\n\n2:51:30.340 --> 2:51:32.860\n than anything I'm going to tell you, right?\n\n2:51:32.860 --> 2:51:34.460\n Yeah.\n\n2:51:34.460 --> 2:51:38.100\n People ask, it's an interesting question.\n\n2:51:38.100 --> 2:51:39.940\n Let me know if you have any recommendations.\n\n2:51:39.940 --> 2:51:43.700\n What three books, technical or fiction or philosophical,\n\n2:51:43.700 --> 2:51:47.720\n had an impact on your life or you would recommend perhaps?\n\n2:51:49.180 --> 2:51:51.100\n Maybe we'll start with the least controversial,\n\n2:51:51.100 --> 2:51:56.100\n Infinite Jest, Infinite Jest is a...\n\n2:51:57.500 --> 2:51:58.860\n David Foster Wallace.\n\n2:51:58.860 --> 2:52:01.100\n Yeah, it's a book about wireheading, really.\n\n2:52:03.820 --> 2:52:07.540\n Very enjoyable to read, very well written.\n\n2:52:07.540 --> 2:52:11.180\n You know, you will grow as a person reading this book,\n\n2:52:11.180 --> 2:52:14.740\n its effort, and I'll set that up for the second book,\n\n2:52:14.740 --> 2:52:17.500\n which is pornography, it's called Atlas Shrugged,\n\n2:52:17.500 --> 2:52:21.020\n which...\n\n2:52:21.020 --> 2:52:22.580\n Atlas Shrugged is pornography.\n\n2:52:22.580 --> 2:52:25.540\n I mean, it is, I will not defend the,\n\n2:52:25.540 --> 2:52:28.380\n I will not say Atlas Shrugged is a well written book.\n\n2:52:28.380 --> 2:52:31.380\n It is entertaining to read, certainly, just like pornography.\n\n2:52:31.380 --> 2:52:33.540\n The production value isn't great.\n\n2:52:33.540 --> 2:52:36.220\n You know, there's a 60 page monologue in there\n\n2:52:36.220 --> 2:52:38.740\n that Ann Rand's editor really wanted to take out.\n\n2:52:38.740 --> 2:52:42.580\n And she paid, she paid out of her pocket\n\n2:52:42.580 --> 2:52:45.060\n to keep that 60 page monologue in the book.\n\n2:52:45.060 --> 2:52:50.060\n But it is a great book for a kind of framework\n\n2:52:53.220 --> 2:52:54.660\n of human relations.\n\n2:52:54.660 --> 2:52:55.960\n And I know a lot of people are like,\n\n2:52:55.960 --> 2:52:58.060\n yeah, but it's a terrible framework.\n\n2:52:58.060 --> 2:53:00.500\n Yeah, but it's a framework.\n\n2:53:00.500 --> 2:53:02.360\n Just for context, in a couple of days,\n\n2:53:02.360 --> 2:53:06.260\n I'm speaking for probably four plus hours\n\n2:53:06.260 --> 2:53:10.200\n with Yaron Brook, who's the main living,\n\n2:53:10.200 --> 2:53:13.340\n remaining objectivist, objectivist.\n\n2:53:13.340 --> 2:53:14.580\n Interesting.\n\n2:53:14.580 --> 2:53:19.380\n So I've always found this philosophy quite interesting\n\n2:53:19.380 --> 2:53:20.260\n on many levels.\n\n2:53:20.260 --> 2:53:24.020\n One of how repulsive some percent of,\n\n2:53:24.020 --> 2:53:26.300\n large percent of the population find it,\n\n2:53:26.300 --> 2:53:29.140\n which is always, always funny to me\n\n2:53:29.140 --> 2:53:32.980\n when people are like unable to even read a philosophy\n\n2:53:32.980 --> 2:53:36.700\n because of some, I think that says more\n\n2:53:36.700 --> 2:53:40.580\n about their psychological perspective on it.\n\n2:53:40.580 --> 2:53:45.300\n But there is something about objectivism\n\n2:53:45.300 --> 2:53:48.780\n and Ann Rand's philosophy that's deeply connected\n\n2:53:48.780 --> 2:53:50.740\n to this idea of capitalism,\n\n2:53:50.740 --> 2:53:54.620\n of the ethical life is the productive life\n\n2:53:56.620 --> 2:54:00.740\n that was always compelling to me.\n\n2:54:00.740 --> 2:54:03.160\n It didn't seem as, like I didn't seem to interpret it\n\n2:54:03.160 --> 2:54:05.660\n in the negative sense that some people do.\n\n2:54:05.660 --> 2:54:07.980\n To be fair, I read that book when I was 19.\n\n2:54:07.980 --> 2:54:09.620\n So you had an impact at that point, yeah.\n\n2:54:09.620 --> 2:54:13.700\n Yeah, and the bad guys in the book have this slogan\n\n2:54:13.700 --> 2:54:15.340\n from each according to their ability\n\n2:54:15.340 --> 2:54:17.300\n to each according to their need.\n\n2:54:17.300 --> 2:54:19.740\n And I'm looking at this and I'm like,\n\n2:54:19.740 --> 2:54:20.580\n these are the most cart,\n\n2:54:20.580 --> 2:54:22.940\n this is team rocket level cartoonishness, right?\n\n2:54:22.940 --> 2:54:23.820\n No bad guy.\n\n2:54:23.820 --> 2:54:25.780\n And then when I realized that was actually the slogan\n\n2:54:25.780 --> 2:54:29.940\n of the communist party, I'm like, wait a second.\n\n2:54:29.940 --> 2:54:31.660\n Wait, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n2:54:31.660 --> 2:54:34.100\n You're telling me this really happened?\n\n2:54:34.100 --> 2:54:34.920\n Yeah, it's interesting.\n\n2:54:34.920 --> 2:54:36.660\n I mean, one of the criticisms of her work\n\n2:54:36.660 --> 2:54:39.220\n is she has a cartoonish view of good and evil.\n\n2:54:39.220 --> 2:54:44.220\n Like the reality, as Jordan Peterson says,\n\n2:54:44.300 --> 2:54:47.420\n is that each of us have the capacity for good and evil\n\n2:54:47.420 --> 2:54:49.940\n in us as opposed to like, there's some characters\n\n2:54:49.940 --> 2:54:52.220\n who are purely evil and some characters that are purely good.\n\n2:54:52.220 --> 2:54:55.220\n And that's in a way why it's pornographic.\n\n2:54:55.220 --> 2:54:57.020\n The production value, I love it.\n\n2:54:57.020 --> 2:54:59.540\n Like evil is punished and there's very clearly,\n\n2:55:01.020 --> 2:55:06.020\n there's no, just like porn doesn't have character growth.\n\n2:55:06.020 --> 2:55:09.540\n Well, you know, neither does Alice Shrugged, like.\n\n2:55:09.540 --> 2:55:10.860\n Really, well put.\n\n2:55:10.860 --> 2:55:14.220\n But at 19 year old George Hots, it was good enough.\n\n2:55:14.220 --> 2:55:15.380\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:55:15.380 --> 2:55:16.940\n What's the third?\n\n2:55:16.940 --> 2:55:18.620\n You have something?\n\n2:55:18.620 --> 2:55:21.520\n I could give, these two I'll just throw out.\n\n2:55:21.520 --> 2:55:22.420\n They're sci fi.\n\n2:55:22.420 --> 2:55:24.280\n Perputation City.\n\n2:55:24.280 --> 2:55:26.620\n Great thing to start thinking about copies of yourself.\n\n2:55:26.620 --> 2:55:27.460\n And then the...\n\n2:55:27.460 --> 2:55:28.280\n Who's that by?\n\n2:55:28.280 --> 2:55:29.120\n Sorry, I didn't catch that.\n\n2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:30.900\n That is Greg Egan.\n\n2:55:31.980 --> 2:55:33.540\n He's a, that might not be his real name.\n\n2:55:33.540 --> 2:55:35.740\n Some Australian guy, might not be Australian.\n\n2:55:35.740 --> 2:55:36.700\n I don't know.\n\n2:55:36.700 --> 2:55:38.740\n And then this one's online.\n\n2:55:38.740 --> 2:55:41.180\n It's called The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect.\n\n2:55:43.020 --> 2:55:45.420\n It's a story set in a post singularity world.\n\n2:55:45.420 --> 2:55:46.720\n It's interesting.\n\n2:55:46.720 --> 2:55:49.180\n Is there, can you, either of the worlds,\n\n2:55:49.180 --> 2:55:51.540\n do you find something philosophical interesting in them\n\n2:55:51.540 --> 2:55:52.740\n that you can comment on?\n\n2:55:53.660 --> 2:55:55.780\n I mean, it is clear to me that\n\n2:55:57.860 --> 2:56:00.620\n Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect is like written by\n\n2:56:00.620 --> 2:56:03.780\n an engineer, which is,\n\n2:56:03.780 --> 2:56:08.780\n it's very almost a pragmatic take on a utopia, in a way.\n\n2:56:12.620 --> 2:56:13.820\n Positive or negative?\n\n2:56:15.260 --> 2:56:17.940\n That's up to you to decide reading the book.\n\n2:56:17.940 --> 2:56:21.580\n And the ending of it is very interesting as well.\n\n2:56:21.580 --> 2:56:23.660\n And I didn't realize what it was.\n\n2:56:23.660 --> 2:56:25.260\n I first read that when I was 15.\n\n2:56:25.260 --> 2:56:27.540\n I've reread that book several times in my life.\n\n2:56:27.540 --> 2:56:29.220\n And it's short, it's 50 pages.\n\n2:56:29.220 --> 2:56:30.740\n Everyone should go read it.\n\n2:56:30.740 --> 2:56:33.100\n What's, sorry, it's a little tangent.\n\n2:56:33.100 --> 2:56:34.700\n I've been working through the foundation.\n\n2:56:34.700 --> 2:56:37.060\n I've been, I haven't read much sci fi my whole life\n\n2:56:37.060 --> 2:56:40.180\n and I'm trying to fix that the last few months.\n\n2:56:40.180 --> 2:56:42.180\n That's been a little side project.\n\n2:56:42.180 --> 2:56:46.180\n What's to you as the greatest sci fi novel\n\n2:56:46.180 --> 2:56:47.740\n that people should read?\n\n2:56:47.740 --> 2:56:49.220\n Or is that?\n\n2:56:49.220 --> 2:56:51.180\n I mean, I would, yeah, I would say like, yeah,\n\n2:56:51.180 --> 2:56:53.820\n Permutation City, Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect.\n\n2:56:53.820 --> 2:56:54.660\n I don't know.\n\n2:56:54.660 --> 2:56:56.240\n I didn't like Foundation.\n\n2:56:56.240 --> 2:56:58.820\n I thought it was way too modernist.\n\n2:56:58.820 --> 2:57:00.780\n You like Dune and all of those.\n\n2:57:00.780 --> 2:57:01.780\n I've never read Dune.\n\n2:57:01.780 --> 2:57:02.820\n I've never read Dune.\n\n2:57:02.820 --> 2:57:04.580\n I have to read it.\n\n2:57:04.580 --> 2:57:07.380\n Fire Upon the Deep is interesting.\n\n2:57:09.140 --> 2:57:10.540\n Okay, I mean, look, everyone should read,\n\n2:57:10.540 --> 2:57:11.380\n everyone should read Neuromancer.\n\n2:57:11.380 --> 2:57:12.820\n Everyone should read Snow Crash.\n\n2:57:12.820 --> 2:57:15.500\n If you haven't read those, like start there.\n\n2:57:15.500 --> 2:57:16.340\n Yeah, I haven't read Snow Crash.\n\n2:57:16.340 --> 2:57:17.460\n You haven't read Snow Crash?\n\n2:57:17.460 --> 2:57:19.980\n Oh, it's, I mean, it's very entertaining.\n\n2:57:19.980 --> 2:57:20.820\n Go to Lesher Bach.\n\n2:57:20.820 --> 2:57:22.220\n And if you want the controversial one,\n\n2:57:22.220 --> 2:57:23.220\n Bronze Age Mindset.\n\n2:57:25.340 --> 2:57:27.740\n All right, I'll look into that one.\n\n2:57:27.740 --> 2:57:30.360\n Those aren't sci fi, but just to round out books.\n\n2:57:30.360 --> 2:57:34.360\n So a bunch of people asked me on Twitter\n\n2:57:34.360 --> 2:57:36.880\n and Reddit and so on for advice.\n\n2:57:36.880 --> 2:57:39.440\n So what advice would you give a young person today\n\n2:57:39.440 --> 2:57:40.560\n about life?\n\n2:57:40.560 --> 2:57:45.560\n In other words, what, yeah, I mean, looking back,\n\n2:57:47.480 --> 2:57:50.480\n especially when you were younger, you did,\n\n2:57:50.480 --> 2:57:51.560\n and you continued it.\n\n2:57:51.560 --> 2:57:54.840\n You've accomplished a lot of interesting things.\n\n2:57:54.840 --> 2:57:57.840\n Is there some advice from those,\n\n2:57:57.840 --> 2:58:01.880\n from that life of yours that you can pass on?\n\n2:58:01.880 --> 2:58:03.760\n If college ever opens again,\n\n2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:07.640\n I would love to give a graduation speech.\n\n2:58:07.640 --> 2:58:11.360\n At that point, I will put a lot of somewhat satirical effort\n\n2:58:11.360 --> 2:58:12.320\n into this question.\n\n2:58:12.320 --> 2:58:15.880\n Yeah, at this, you haven't written anything at this point.\n\n2:58:15.880 --> 2:58:16.760\n Oh, you know what?\n\n2:58:16.760 --> 2:58:18.240\n Always wear sunscreen.\n\n2:58:18.240 --> 2:58:19.560\n This is water.\n\n2:58:19.560 --> 2:58:21.160\n Pick your plagiarizing.\n\n2:58:21.160 --> 2:58:23.960\n I mean, you know, but that's the,\n\n2:58:23.960 --> 2:58:26.240\n that's the like clean your room.\n\n2:58:26.240 --> 2:58:28.600\n You know, yeah, you can plagiarize from all of this stuff.\n\n2:58:28.600 --> 2:58:33.600\n And it's, there is no,\n\n2:58:35.920 --> 2:58:37.680\n self help books aren't designed to help you.\n\n2:58:37.680 --> 2:58:40.080\n They're designed to make you feel good.\n\n2:58:40.080 --> 2:58:44.120\n Like whatever advice I could give, you already know.\n\n2:58:44.120 --> 2:58:45.840\n Everyone already knows.\n\n2:58:45.840 --> 2:58:47.520\n Sorry, it doesn't feel good.\n\n2:58:50.240 --> 2:58:51.080\n Right?\n\n2:58:51.080 --> 2:58:53.040\n Like, you know, you know,\n\n2:58:53.040 --> 2:58:56.880\n if I tell you that you should, you know,\n\n2:58:56.880 --> 2:59:01.880\n eat well and read more and it's not gonna do anything.\n\n2:59:01.920 --> 2:59:03.480\n I think the whole like genre\n\n2:59:03.480 --> 2:59:07.480\n of those kinds of questions is meaningless.\n\n2:59:07.480 --> 2:59:08.320\n I don't know.\n\n2:59:08.320 --> 2:59:10.560\n If anything, it's don't worry so much about that stuff.\n\n2:59:10.560 --> 2:59:12.440\n Don't be so caught up in your head.\n\n2:59:12.440 --> 2:59:13.280\n Right.\n\n2:59:13.280 --> 2:59:14.280\n I mean, you're, yeah.\n\n2:59:14.280 --> 2:59:16.560\n In a sense that your whole life,\n\n2:59:16.560 --> 2:59:20.680\n your whole existence is like moving version of that advice.\n\n2:59:20.680 --> 2:59:23.840\n I don't know.\n\n2:59:23.840 --> 2:59:25.480\n There's something, I mean,\n\n2:59:25.480 --> 2:59:27.080\n there's something in you that resists\n\n2:59:27.080 --> 2:59:29.800\n that kind of thinking and that in itself is,\n\n2:59:30.880 --> 2:59:34.480\n it's just illustrative of who you are.\n\n2:59:34.480 --> 2:59:36.760\n And there's something to learn from that.\n\n2:59:36.760 --> 2:59:39.760\n I think you're clearly not overthinking stuff.\n\n2:59:41.280 --> 2:59:42.120\n Yeah.\n\n2:59:42.120 --> 2:59:42.960\n And you know what?\n\n2:59:42.960 --> 2:59:43.800\n There's a gut thing.\n\n2:59:43.800 --> 2:59:45.000\n Even when I talk about my advice,\n\n2:59:45.000 --> 2:59:47.400\n I'm like, my advice is only relevant to me.\n\n2:59:47.400 --> 2:59:48.720\n It's not relevant to anybody else.\n\n2:59:48.720 --> 2:59:49.960\n I'm not saying you should go out.\n\n2:59:49.960 --> 2:59:51.640\n If you're the kind of person who overthinks things\n\n2:59:51.640 --> 2:59:54.080\n to stop overthinking things, it's not bad.\n\n2:59:54.080 --> 2:59:54.960\n It doesn't work for me.\n\n2:59:54.960 --> 2:59:55.800\n Maybe it works for you.\n\n2:59:55.800 --> 2:59:57.960\n I don't know.\n\n2:59:57.960 --> 2:59:59.400\n Let me ask you about love.\n\n2:59:59.400 --> 3:00:00.240\n Yeah.\n\n3:00:02.240 --> 3:00:05.120\n I think last time we talked about the meaning of life\n\n3:00:05.120 --> 3:00:08.640\n and it was kind of about winning.\n\n3:00:08.640 --> 3:00:09.480\n Of course.\n\n3:00:10.880 --> 3:00:13.120\n I don't think I've talked to you about love much,\n\n3:00:13.120 --> 3:00:15.000\n whether romantic or just love\n\n3:00:15.000 --> 3:00:18.120\n for the common humanity amongst us all.\n\n3:00:18.120 --> 3:00:21.400\n What role has love played in your life?\n\n3:00:21.400 --> 3:00:26.360\n In this quest for winning, where does love fit in?\n\n3:00:26.360 --> 3:00:29.840\n Well, the word love, I think means several different things.\n\n3:00:29.840 --> 3:00:32.960\n There's love in the sense of, maybe I could just say,\n\n3:00:32.960 --> 3:00:34.400\n there's like love in the sense of opiates\n\n3:00:34.400 --> 3:00:37.880\n and love in the sense of oxytocin\n\n3:00:37.880 --> 3:00:40.080\n and then love in the sense of,\n\n3:00:43.080 --> 3:00:44.480\n maybe like a love for math.\n\n3:00:44.480 --> 3:00:45.640\n I don't think it fits into either\n\n3:00:45.640 --> 3:00:49.160\n of those first two paradigms.\n\n3:00:49.160 --> 3:00:53.480\n So each of those, have they given something to you\n\n3:00:55.560 --> 3:00:56.920\n in your life?\n\n3:00:56.920 --> 3:00:59.120\n I'm not that big of a fan of the first two.\n\n3:01:00.800 --> 3:01:01.640\n Why?\n\n3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:06.360\n The same reason I'm not a fan of,\n\n3:01:06.360 --> 3:01:09.880\n the same reason I don't do opiates and don't take ecstasy.\n\n3:01:09.880 --> 3:01:14.200\n And there were times, look, I've tried both.\n\n3:01:14.200 --> 3:01:17.320\n I liked opiates way more than I liked ecstasy,\n\n3:01:18.400 --> 3:01:23.400\n but they're not, the ethical life is the productive life.\n\n3:01:24.400 --> 3:01:27.080\n So maybe that's my problem with those.\n\n3:01:27.080 --> 3:01:29.440\n And then like, yeah, a sense of, I don't know,\n\n3:01:29.440 --> 3:01:32.200\n like abstract love for humanity.\n\n3:01:32.200 --> 3:01:34.520\n I mean, the abstract love for humanity,\n\n3:01:34.520 --> 3:01:36.200\n I'm like, yeah, I've always felt that.\n\n3:01:36.200 --> 3:01:39.680\n And I guess it's hard for me to imagine\n\n3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:41.560\n not feeling it and maybe there's people who don't.\n\n3:01:41.560 --> 3:01:43.560\n And I don't know.\n\n3:01:43.560 --> 3:01:46.520\n Yeah, that's just like a background thing that's there.\n\n3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:49.560\n I mean, since we brought up drugs, let me ask you,\n\n3:01:51.760 --> 3:01:54.000\n this is becoming more and more a part of my life\n\n3:01:54.000 --> 3:01:55.520\n because I'm talking to a few researchers\n\n3:01:55.520 --> 3:01:57.680\n that are working on psychedelics.\n\n3:01:57.680 --> 3:02:00.440\n I've eaten shrooms a couple of times\n\n3:02:00.440 --> 3:02:04.680\n and it was fascinating to me that like the mind can go,\n\n3:02:04.680 --> 3:02:08.200\n like just fascinating the mind can go to places\n\n3:02:08.200 --> 3:02:09.480\n I didn't imagine it could go.\n\n3:02:09.480 --> 3:02:12.720\n And it was very friendly and positive and exciting\n\n3:02:12.720 --> 3:02:16.160\n and everything was kind of hilarious in the place.\n\n3:02:16.160 --> 3:02:18.200\n Wherever my mind went, that's where I went.\n\n3:02:18.200 --> 3:02:20.960\n Is, what do you think about psychedelics?\n\n3:02:20.960 --> 3:02:24.680\n Do you think they have, where do you think the mind goes?\n\n3:02:24.680 --> 3:02:25.920\n Have you done psychedelics?\n\n3:02:25.920 --> 3:02:28.640\n Where do you think the mind goes?\n\n3:02:28.640 --> 3:02:32.240\n Is there something useful to learn about the places it goes\n\n3:02:32.240 --> 3:02:33.840\n once you come back?\n\n3:02:33.840 --> 3:02:38.040\n I find it interesting that this idea\n\n3:02:38.040 --> 3:02:40.400\n that psychedelics have something to teach\n\n3:02:40.400 --> 3:02:43.800\n is almost unique to psychedelics, right?\n\n3:02:43.800 --> 3:02:46.560\n People don't argue this about amphetamines.\n\n3:02:46.560 --> 3:02:50.240\n And I'm not really sure why.\n\n3:02:50.240 --> 3:02:53.800\n I think all of the drugs have lessons to teach.\n\n3:02:53.800 --> 3:02:55.160\n I think there's things to learn from opiates.\n\n3:02:55.160 --> 3:02:56.600\n I think there's things to learn from amphetamines.\n\n3:02:56.600 --> 3:02:58.160\n I think there's things to learn from psychedelics,\n\n3:02:58.160 --> 3:02:59.720\n things to learn from marijuana.\n\n3:03:02.320 --> 3:03:05.200\n But also at the same time recognize\n\n3:03:05.200 --> 3:03:07.400\n that I don't think you're learning things about the world.\n\n3:03:07.400 --> 3:03:09.160\n I think you're learning things about yourself.\n\n3:03:09.160 --> 3:03:10.680\n Yes.\n\n3:03:10.680 --> 3:03:14.480\n And, you know, what's the, even, it might've even been,\n\n3:03:15.760 --> 3:03:17.240\n might've even been a Timothy Leary quote.\n\n3:03:17.240 --> 3:03:18.200\n I don't wanna misquote him,\n\n3:03:18.200 --> 3:03:20.240\n but the idea is basically like, you know,\n\n3:03:20.240 --> 3:03:21.600\n everybody should look behind the door,\n\n3:03:21.600 --> 3:03:22.760\n but then once you've seen behind the door,\n\n3:03:22.760 --> 3:03:24.400\n you don't need to keep going back.\n\n3:03:26.120 --> 3:03:29.960\n So, I mean, and that's my thoughts on all real drug use too.\n\n3:03:29.960 --> 3:03:31.200\n Except maybe for caffeine.\n\n3:03:32.680 --> 3:03:37.160\n It's a little experience that is good to have, but.\n\n3:03:37.160 --> 3:03:39.240\n Oh yeah, no, I mean, yeah, I guess,\n\n3:03:39.240 --> 3:03:40.880\n yes, psychedelics are definitely.\n\n3:03:41.880 --> 3:03:43.920\n So you're a fan of new experiences, I suppose.\n\n3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:44.760\n Yes.\n\n3:03:44.760 --> 3:03:45.880\n Because they all contain a little,\n\n3:03:45.880 --> 3:03:47.000\n especially the first few times,\n\n3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:49.720\n it contains some lessons that can be picked up.\n\n3:03:49.720 --> 3:03:53.960\n Yeah, and I'll revisit psychedelics maybe once a year.\n\n3:03:55.720 --> 3:03:57.680\n Usually smaller doses.\n\n3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:01.440\n Maybe they turn up the learning rate of your brain.\n\n3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:03.160\n I've heard that, I like that.\n\n3:04:03.160 --> 3:04:04.280\n Yeah, that's cool.\n\n3:04:04.280 --> 3:04:07.360\n Big learning rates have pros and cons.\n\n3:04:07.360 --> 3:04:09.440\n Last question, and this is a little weird one,\n\n3:04:09.440 --> 3:04:11.800\n but you've called yourself crazy in the past.\n\n3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:16.120\n First of all, on a scale of one to 10,\n\n3:04:16.120 --> 3:04:18.040\n how crazy would you say are you?\n\n3:04:18.040 --> 3:04:19.480\n Oh, I mean, it depends how you, you know,\n\n3:04:19.480 --> 3:04:21.680\n when you compare me to Elon Musk and Anthony Levandowski,\n\n3:04:21.680 --> 3:04:22.560\n not so crazy.\n\n3:04:23.520 --> 3:04:24.880\n So like a seven?\n\n3:04:25.920 --> 3:04:27.000\n Let's go with six.\n\n3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:29.320\n Six, six, six.\n\n3:04:29.320 --> 3:04:30.160\n What?\n\n3:04:31.440 --> 3:04:32.960\n Well, I like seven, seven's a good number.\n\n3:04:32.960 --> 3:04:36.320\n Seven, all right, well, I'm sure day by day it changes,\n\n3:04:36.320 --> 3:04:39.640\n right, so, but you're in that area.\n\n3:04:42.440 --> 3:04:43.440\n In thinking about that,\n\n3:04:43.440 --> 3:04:45.760\n what do you think is the role of madness?\n\n3:04:45.760 --> 3:04:48.520\n Is that a feature or a bug\n\n3:04:48.520 --> 3:04:50.640\n if you were to dissect your brain?\n\n3:04:51.680 --> 3:04:56.680\n So, okay, from like a mental health lens on crazy,\n\n3:04:57.040 --> 3:04:59.040\n I'm not sure I really believe in that.\n\n3:04:59.040 --> 3:05:02.840\n I'm not sure I really believe in like a lot of that stuff.\n\n3:05:02.840 --> 3:05:05.080\n Right, this concept of, okay, you know,\n\n3:05:05.080 --> 3:05:09.560\n when you get over to like hardcore bipolar and schizophrenia,\n\n3:05:09.560 --> 3:05:13.160\n these things are clearly real, somewhat biological.\n\n3:05:13.160 --> 3:05:14.480\n And then over here on the spectrum,\n\n3:05:14.480 --> 3:05:18.360\n you have like ADD and oppositional defiance disorder\n\n3:05:18.360 --> 3:05:20.760\n and these things that are like,\n\n3:05:20.760 --> 3:05:22.800\n wait, this is normal spectrum human behavior.\n\n3:05:22.800 --> 3:05:27.800\n Like this isn't, you know, where's the line here\n\n3:05:28.640 --> 3:05:31.320\n and why is this like a problem?\n\n3:05:31.320 --> 3:05:33.280\n So there's this whole, you know,\n\n3:05:33.280 --> 3:05:35.840\n the neurodiversity of humanity is huge.\n\n3:05:35.840 --> 3:05:37.640\n Like people think I'm always on drugs.\n\n3:05:37.640 --> 3:05:38.920\n People are saying this to me on my streams.\n\n3:05:38.920 --> 3:05:39.760\n And I'm like, guys, you know,\n\n3:05:39.760 --> 3:05:41.320\n like I'm real open with my drug use.\n\n3:05:41.320 --> 3:05:44.080\n I'd tell you if I was on drugs and yeah,\n\n3:05:44.080 --> 3:05:45.640\n I had like a cup of coffee this morning,\n\n3:05:45.640 --> 3:05:47.240\n but other than that, this is just me.\n\n3:05:47.240 --> 3:05:49.840\n You're witnessing my brain in action.\n\n3:05:51.400 --> 3:05:55.600\n So the word madness doesn't even make sense\n\n3:05:55.600 --> 3:05:59.680\n in the rich neurodiversity of humans.\n\n3:05:59.680 --> 3:06:04.600\n I think it makes sense, but only for like\n\n3:06:04.600 --> 3:06:07.040\n some insane extremes.\n\n3:06:07.040 --> 3:06:11.720\n Like if you are actually like visibly hallucinating,\n\n3:06:11.720 --> 3:06:15.000\n you know, that's okay.\n\n3:06:15.000 --> 3:06:17.440\n But there is the kind of spectrum on which you stand out.\n\n3:06:17.440 --> 3:06:22.000\n Like that's like, if I were to look, you know,\n\n3:06:22.000 --> 3:06:25.080\n at decorations on a Christmas tree or something like that,\n\n3:06:25.080 --> 3:06:28.760\n like if you were a decoration, that would catch my eye.\n\n3:06:28.760 --> 3:06:33.760\n Like that thing is sparkly, whatever the hell that thing is.\n\n3:06:35.360 --> 3:06:37.360\n There's something to that.\n\n3:06:37.360 --> 3:06:42.120\n Just like refusing to be boring\n\n3:06:42.120 --> 3:06:43.920\n or maybe boring is the wrong word,\n\n3:06:43.920 --> 3:06:48.920\n but to yeah, I mean, be willing to sparkle, you know?\n\n3:06:52.440 --> 3:06:54.200\n It's like somewhat constructed.\n\n3:06:54.200 --> 3:06:57.000\n I mean, I am who I choose to be.\n\n3:06:57.000 --> 3:07:01.000\n I'm gonna say things as true as I can see them.\n\n3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:04.480\n I'm not gonna lie.\n\n3:07:04.480 --> 3:07:06.600\n But that's a really important feature in itself.\n\n3:07:06.600 --> 3:07:09.080\n So like whatever the neurodiversity of your,\n\n3:07:09.080 --> 3:07:13.800\n whatever your brain is, not putting constraints on it\n\n3:07:13.800 --> 3:07:18.720\n that force it to fit into the mold of what society is like,\n\n3:07:18.720 --> 3:07:20.640\n defines what you're supposed to be.\n\n3:07:20.640 --> 3:07:22.360\n So you're one of the specimens\n\n3:07:22.360 --> 3:07:27.360\n that doesn't mind being yourself.\n\n3:07:27.800 --> 3:07:31.720\n Being right is super important,\n\n3:07:31.720 --> 3:07:33.760\n except at the expense of being wrong.\n\n3:07:37.240 --> 3:07:38.480\n Without breaking that apart,\n\n3:07:38.480 --> 3:07:40.400\n I think it's a beautiful way to end it.\n\n3:07:40.400 --> 3:07:43.080\n George, you're one of the most special humans I know.\n\n3:07:43.080 --> 3:07:44.600\n It's truly an honor to talk to you.\n\n3:07:44.600 --> 3:07:45.800\n Thanks so much for doing it.\n\n3:07:45.800 --> 3:07:47.640\n Thank you for having
