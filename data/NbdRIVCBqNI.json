University,\n\n00:06.880 --> 00:10.400\n and one of the most brilliant and bold thinkers and scientists\n\n00:10.400 --> 00:12.480\n I've ever had the pleasure of speaking with.\n\n00:12.480 --> 00:15.120\n She's the author of a book that revolutionized\n\n00:15.120 --> 00:17.200\n our understanding of emotion in the brain\n\n00:17.200 --> 00:19.440\n called How Emotions Are Made.\n\n00:19.440 --> 00:22.320\n And she's coming out with a new book called\n\n00:22.320 --> 00:24.960\n Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain\n\n00:24.960 --> 00:28.160\n that you can and should preorder now.\n\n00:28.160 --> 00:30.320\n I got a chance to read it already,\n\n00:30.320 --> 00:31.920\n and it's one of the best short,\n\n00:31.920 --> 00:35.440\n whirlwind introductions to the human brain I've ever read.\n\n00:35.440 --> 00:37.280\n It comes out on November 17th,\n\n00:37.280 --> 00:39.920\n but again, if there's anybody worth supporting,\n\n00:39.920 --> 00:42.960\n it's Lisa, so please do preorder the book now.\n\n00:43.440 --> 00:45.680\n Lisa and I agreed to speak once again\n\n00:45.680 --> 00:47.840\n around the time of the book release,\n\n00:47.840 --> 00:50.720\n especially because we felt that this first conversation\n\n00:50.720 --> 00:52.240\n is good to release now,\n\n00:52.240 --> 00:54.480\n since we talk about the divisive time\n\n00:54.480 --> 00:56.560\n we're living through in the United States,\n\n00:56.560 --> 00:58.800\n leading up to the election.\n\n00:58.800 --> 01:01.760\n And she gives me a whole new way to think about it\n\n01:01.760 --> 01:03.600\n from a neuroscience perspective\n\n01:03.600 --> 01:06.400\n that is ultimately inspiring of empathy,\n\n01:06.400 --> 01:08.080\n compassion, and love.\n\n01:08.640 --> 01:10.400\n Quick mention of each sponsor,\n\n01:10.400 --> 01:13.120\n followed by some thoughts related to this episode.\n\n01:13.680 --> 01:15.760\n First sponsor is Athletic Greens,\n\n01:15.760 --> 01:18.880\n the all in one drink that I start every day with\n\n01:18.880 --> 01:20.960\n to cover all my nutritional bases\n\n01:20.960 --> 01:23.360\n that I don't otherwise get through my diet naturally.\n\n01:23.840 --> 01:25.520\n Second is Magic Spoon,\n\n01:25.520 --> 01:27.920\n low carb, keto friendly, delicious cereal\n\n01:27.920 --> 01:31.360\n that I reward myself with after a productive day.\n\n01:31.360 --> 01:32.880\n The cocoa flavor is my favorite.\n\n01:33.520 --> 01:35.360\n Third sponsor is Cash App,\n\n01:35.360 --> 01:39.520\n the app I use to send money to friends for food, drinks,\n\n01:39.520 --> 01:42.480\n and unfortunately, for the many bets I have lost to them.\n\n01:43.200 --> 01:45.360\n Please check out these sponsors in the description\n\n01:45.360 --> 01:48.080\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n01:49.120 --> 01:51.680\n As a side note, let me say that the bold,\n\n01:51.680 --> 01:53.760\n first principles way that Lisa approaches\n\n01:53.760 --> 01:57.200\n our study of the brain is something that has inspired me\n\n01:57.200 --> 01:59.200\n ever since I learned about her work.\n\n01:59.200 --> 02:03.280\n And in fact, I invited her to speak at the AGI series\n\n02:03.280 --> 02:05.680\n I organized at MIT several years ago.\n\n02:06.240 --> 02:09.120\n But as a little twist, instead of a lecture,\n\n02:09.120 --> 02:10.960\n we did a conversation in front of the class.\n\n02:11.600 --> 02:13.600\n I think that was one of the early moments\n\n02:13.600 --> 02:16.000\n that led me to start this very podcast.\n\n02:16.800 --> 02:18.960\n It was scary and gratifying,\n\n02:18.960 --> 02:21.120\n which is exactly what life is all about.\n\n02:21.120 --> 02:24.000\n And it's kind of funny how life turns on little moments\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:27.360\n like these that at the time don't seem to be anything\n\n02:27.360 --> 02:28.640\n out of the ordinary.\n\n02:28.640 --> 02:31.040\n

lot about the brain today,\n\n02:47.200 --> 02:49.600\n do you think, let's ask the craziest question,\n\n02:49.600 --> 02:51.520\n do you think there's other intelligent life\n\n02:51.520 --> 02:52.720\n out there in the universe?\n\n02:53.760 --> 02:55.680\n Honestly, I've been asking myself lately\n\n02:55.680 --> 02:57.760\n if there's intelligent life on this planet.\n\n02:58.880 --> 03:05.120\n You know, I have to think probabilities suggest yes.\n\n03:05.120 --> 03:08.880\n And also, secretly, I think I just hope that's true.\n\n03:08.880 --> 03:11.840\n It would be really, I know scientists\n\n03:11.840 --> 03:13.520\n aren't supposed to have hopes and dreams,\n\n03:13.520 --> 03:16.640\n but I think it would be really cool.\n\n03:16.640 --> 03:20.960\n And I also think it would be really sad if it wasn't the case.\n\n03:20.960 --> 03:22.800\n If we really were alone, that would be,\n\n03:24.080 --> 03:29.200\n that would seem profoundly sad, I think.\n\n03:29.200 --> 03:30.960\n So it's exciting to you, not scary?\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:35.920\n Yeah, no, you know, I take a lot of comfort and curiosity.\n\n03:36.640 --> 03:44.400\n It's a great resource for dealing with stress.\n\n03:44.400 --> 03:49.280\n So I'm learning all about mushrooms and octopuses\n\n03:49.280 --> 03:50.960\n and, you know, all kinds of stuff.\n\n03:51.840 --> 03:55.760\n And so for me, this counts, I think, in the realm of awe.\n\n03:55.760 --> 03:59.600\n But also, I think I'm somebody who cultivates awe\n\n03:59.600 --> 04:02.960\n deliberately on purpose to feel like a speck, you know?\n\n04:02.960 --> 04:06.640\n I find it a relief occasionally.\n\n04:06.640 --> 04:07.360\n To feel small.\n\n04:07.360 --> 04:12.480\n To feel small in a profoundly large and interesting universe.\n\n04:12.480 --> 04:17.840\n So, maybe to dig more technically on the question of intelligence,\n\n04:17.840 --> 04:20.960\n do you think it's difficult for intelligent life to arise\n\n04:20.960 --> 04:22.000\n like it did on Earth?\n\n04:22.560 --> 04:25.520\n From everything you've written and studied about the brain,\n\n04:26.320 --> 04:32.560\n how magical of a thing is it in terms of the odds it takes to arise?\n\n04:32.560 --> 04:38.400\n Yeah, so, you know, magic is just, don't get me wrong.\n\n04:38.400 --> 04:43.440\n I mean, I like a magic show as much as the next person.\n\n04:43.440 --> 04:45.680\n My husband was a magician at one time.\n\n04:45.680 --> 04:48.560\n But, you know, magic is just a bunch of stuff\n\n04:48.560 --> 04:50.640\n that we don't really understand how it works yet.\n\n04:50.640 --> 04:52.640\n So I would say from what I understand,\n\n04:53.440 --> 04:59.040\n there are some major steps in the course of evolution\n\n04:59.040 --> 05:00.720\n that at the beginning of life,\n\n05:00.720 --> 05:04.000\n the step from single cell to multicellular organisms,\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:06.480\n things like that, which are really not known.\n\n05:06.480 --> 05:16.000\n I think for me, the question is not so much what's the likelihood\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:22.560\n that it would happen again as much as what are the steps\n\n05:22.560 --> 05:24.080\n and how long would it take?\n\n05:24.080 --> 05:26.400\n And if it were to happen again on Earth,\n\n05:28.160 --> 05:33.120\n would we end up with the same menu of life forms\n\n05:33.120 --> 05:34.400\n that we currently have now?\n\n05:34.400 --> 05:36.320\n And I think the answer is probably no, right?\n\n05:36.320 --> 05:38.640\n There's just so much about evolution\n\n05:38.640 --> 05:43.120\n that is stochastic and driven by chance.\n\n05:43.120 --> 05:44.560\n But the question is whether that menu\n\n05:44.560 --> 05:46.240\n would be equally delicious,\n\n05:46.240 --> 05:49.840\n meaning like there'd be rich complexity of the kind of,\n\n05:49.840 --> 05:52.480\n like would we get dolphins and humans\n\n05:52.480 --> 05:54.640\n or whoever else falls in that category\n\n05:54.640 --> 05:58.480\n of weirdly intelligent, seemingly intelligent?\n\n05:59.120 --> 06:00.400\n However we define that.\n\n06:01.120 --> 06:03.200\n Well, I think that has to be true.\n\n06:03.200 --> 06:05.760\n If you just look at the range of creatures\n\n06:05.760 --> 06:06.960\n who've gone extinct.\n\n06:06.960 --> 06:09.600\n I mean, if you look at the range of creatures\n\n06:09.600 --> 06:12.320\n that are on the Earth now, it's incredible.\n\n06:13.040 --> 06:14.720\n And it's sort of tried to say that,\n\n06:14.720 --> 06:16.720\n but it actually is really incredible.\n\n06:18.080 --> 06:22.800\n Particularly, I don't know, I mean, animals,\n\n06:22.800 --> 06:26.160\n there are animals that seem really ordinary\n\n06:26.160 --> 06:27.680\n until you watch them closely\n\n06:27.680 --> 06:29.360\n and then they become miraculous,\n\n06:29.360 --> 06:30.880\n like certain types of birds,\n\n06:30.880 --> 06:32.720\n which do very miraculous things,\n\n06:32.720 --> 06:36.080\n build bowers and do dances\n\n06:36.080 --> 06:37.600\n and all these really funky things\n\n06:37.600 --> 06:39.840\n that are hard to explain\n\n06:39.840 --> 06:41.600\n with a standard evolutionary story,\n\n06:41.600 --> 06:43.760\n although people have them.\n\n06:43.760 --> 06:44.720\n Yeah, the birds are weird.\n\n06:44.720 --> 06:47.280\n They do a lot for mating purposes.\n\n06:47.280 --> 06:49.840\n They have a concept of beauty\n\n06:49.840 --> 06:52.560\n that I haven't quite, maybe you know much better,\n\n06:52.560 --> 06:55.600\n but it doesn't seem to fit evolutionary arguments well.\n\n06:55.600 --> 06:56.640\n It does fit.\n\n06:56.640 --> 06:57.760\n Well, it depends, right?\n\n06:57.760 --> 07:00.080\n So I think you're talking about the evolution of beauty,\n\n07:00.080 --> 07:03.200\n the book that was written recently by,\n\n07:03.200 --> 07:06.160\n was it Frum, was that his name?\n\n07:06.160 --> 07:07.760\n Richard Frum, I think, at Yale.\n\n07:07.760 --> 07:09.040\n Oh, I'm sorry, no, I didn't know.\n\n07:09.040 --> 07:09.840\n Oh, it's a great book.\n\n07:09.840 --> 07:11.120\n It's very controversial, though,\n\n07:11.120 --> 07:14.400\n because he's making the argument\n\n07:14.400 --> 07:17.760\n that the question about birds and some other animals\n\n07:17.760 --> 07:19.680\n is why would they engage\n\n07:19.680 --> 07:24.160\n in such metabolically costly displays\n\n07:24.880 --> 07:27.280\n when it doesn't improve their fitness at all?\n\n07:27.280 --> 07:31.120\n And the answer that he gives is the answer that Darwin gave,\n\n07:31.120 --> 07:35.200\n which is sexual selection, not natural selection.\n\n07:35.200 --> 07:37.520\n But selection can occur for all kinds of reasons.\n\n07:37.520 --> 07:39.200\n There could be artificial selection,\n\n07:39.200 --> 07:41.200\n which is when we breed animals, right?\n\n07:41.200 --> 07:43.440\n Which is actually how Darwin,\n\n07:43.440 --> 07:46.400\n that observation helped Darwin come to the idea\n\n07:46.400 --> 07:47.760\n of natural selection.\n\n07:47.760 --> 07:48.560\n Oh, I see.\n\n07:49.040 --> 07:50.800\n And then there's sexual selection,\n\n07:50.800 --> 07:53.440\n meaning, and the argument that,\n\n07:53.440 --> 07:55.040\n I think his name is Frum,\n\n07:55.040 --> 07:59.760\n makes is that it's the pleasure,\n\n07:59.760 --> 08:03.120\n the selection pressure is the pleasure of female birds.\n\n08:03.680 --> 08:07.200\n Which, as a woman, and as someone who studies affect,\n\n08:07.200 --> 08:09.200\n that's a great answer.\n\n08:09.200 --> 08:10.960\n I actually think there probably is natural,\n\n08:10.960 --> 08:13.040\n I think there is an aspect of natural selection to it,\n\n08:13.040 --> 08:14.720\n which he maybe hasn't considered.\n\n08:15.280 --> 08:17.760\n But you were saying the reason we brought up birds\n\n08:17.760 --> 08:20.960\n is the life we've got now seems to be quite incredible.\n\n08:20.960 --> 08:22.880\n Yeah, so he brought up birds,\n\n08:22.880 --> 08:25.200\n now seems to be quite incredible.\n\n08:25.200 --> 08:26.640\n Yeah, so you peek into the ocean,\n\n08:26.640 --> 08:29.600\n peek into the sky, there are miraculous creatures.\n\n08:29.600 --> 08:31.920\n Look at creatures who've gone extinct.\n\n08:31.920 --> 08:35.200\n And in science fiction stories,\n\n08:35.200 --> 08:37.520\n you couldn't dream up something as interesting.\n\n08:37.520 --> 08:43.760\n So my guess is that intelligent life evolves\n\n08:43.760 --> 08:47.040\n in many different ways, even on this planet.\n\n08:47.040 --> 08:48.880\n There isn't one form of intelligence.\n\n08:48.880 --> 08:51.120\n There's not one brain that gives you intelligence.\n\n08:51.120 --> 08:52.720\n There are lots of different brain structures\n\n08:52.720 --> 08:53.840\n that can give you intelligence.\n\n08:54.960 --> 08:59.200\n So my guess is that the menagerie\n\n08:59.200 --> 09:01.520\n might not look exactly the way that it looks now,\n\n09:01.520 --> 09:04.160\n but it would certainly be as interesting.\n\n09:04.800 --> 09:09.280\n But if we look at the human brain versus the brains,\n\n09:09.840 --> 09:10.880\n or whatever you call them,\n\n09:11.440 --> 09:14.240\n the mechanisms of intelligence in our ancestors,\n\n09:14.240 --> 09:15.920\n even early ancestors,\n\n09:15.920 --> 09:18.240\n that you write about, for example, in your new book,\n\n09:18.240 --> 09:25.440\n what's the difference between the fanciest brain we got,\n\n09:25.440 --> 09:26.560\n which is the human brain,\n\n09:27.200 --> 09:30.560\n and the ancestor brains that it came from?\n\n09:31.520 --> 09:33.840\n Yeah, I think it depends on how far back you want to go.\n\n09:34.560 --> 09:37.520\n You go all the way back, right, in your book.\n\n09:38.560 --> 09:41.120\n So what's the interesting comparison, would you say?\n\n09:41.120 --> 09:43.440\n Well, first of all, I wouldn't say that the human brain\n\n09:43.440 --> 09:45.040\n is the fanciest brain we've got.\n\n09:45.040 --> 09:48.000\n I mean, an octopus brain is pretty different\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:48.960\n and pretty fancy,\n\n09:48.960 --> 09:51.040\n and they can do some pretty amazing things\n\n09:51.040 --> 09:51.920\n that we cannot do.\n\n09:52.720 --> 09:54.320\n You know, we can't grow back limbs,\n\n09:54.320 --> 09:56.800\n we can't change color and texture,\n\n09:56.800 --> 09:59.760\n we can't comport ourselves and squeeze ourselves\n\n09:59.760 --> 10:01.120\n into a little crevice.\n\n10:01.120 --> 10:03.040\n I mean, these are things that we invent,\n\n10:03.040 --> 10:04.640\n these are like superhero abilities\n\n10:04.640 --> 10:06.160\n that we invent in stories, right?\n\n10:06.160 --> 10:07.360\n We can't do any of those things.\n\n10:08.080 --> 10:10.000\n And so the human brain is certainly,\n\n10:11.120 --> 10:12.480\n we can certainly do some things\n\n10:12.480 --> 10:13.760\n that other animals can't do.\n\n10:15.440 --> 10:16.960\n That seemed pretty impressive to us.\n\n10:16.960 --> 10:21.520\n But I would say that there are a number of animal brains\n\n10:21.520 --> 10:23.440\n which seem pretty impressive to me\n\n10:23.440 --> 10:25.280\n that can do interesting things\n\n10:25.280 --> 10:27.680\n and really impressive things that we can't do.\n\n10:28.160 --> 10:31.040\n I mean, with your work on how emotions are made and so on,\n\n10:31.040 --> 10:34.560\n you kind of repaint the view of the brain\n\n10:34.560 --> 10:38.400\n as less glamorous, I suppose,\n\n10:38.400 --> 10:41.760\n than you would otherwise think.\n\n10:41.760 --> 10:43.760\n Or like, I guess you draw a thread\n\n10:43.760 --> 10:47.120\n that connects all brains together\n\n10:47.120 --> 10:49.360\n in terms of homeostasis and all that kind of stuff.\n\n10:50.080 --> 10:53.600\n Yeah, I wouldn't say that the human brain\n\n10:53.600 --> 10:57.040\n is any less miraculous than anybody else would say.\n\n10:57.040 --> 11:00.000\n I just think that there are other brain structures\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:01.520\n which are also miraculous.\n\n11:02.080 --> 11:04.080\n And I also think that there are a number of things\n\n11:04.080 --> 11:07.520\n about the human brain which we share\n\n11:07.520 --> 11:11.440\n with other vertebrates, other animals with backbones.\n\n11:11.440 --> 11:16.480\n But that we share these miraculous things.\n\n11:16.480 --> 11:19.040\n But we can do some things in abundance.\n\n11:19.040 --> 11:22.720\n And we can also do some things with our brains together,\n\n11:23.680 --> 11:27.120\n working together that other animals can't do.\n\n11:27.120 --> 11:31.200\n Or at least we haven't discovered their ability to do it.\n\n11:31.200 --> 11:32.320\n Yeah, this social thing.\n\n11:33.120 --> 11:34.560\n That's one of the things you write about.\n\n11:37.040 --> 11:39.760\n How do you make sense of the fact,\n\n11:39.760 --> 11:43.680\n like the book Sapiens, and the fact that we're able\n\n11:43.680 --> 11:46.640\n to kind of connect, like network our brains together\n\n11:47.280 --> 11:48.400\n like you write about?\n\n11:48.400 --> 11:50.240\n I'll try to stop saying that.\n\n11:53.200 --> 11:56.640\n Is that like some kind of feature\n\n11:56.640 --> 11:58.480\n that's built into there?\n\n11:58.480 --> 12:00.160\n Is that unique to our human brains?\n\n12:00.160 --> 12:01.280\n Like how do you make sense of that?\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.240\n What I would say is that our ability\n\n12:04.240 --> 12:09.200\n to coordinate with each other is not unique to humans.\n\n12:09.200 --> 12:12.240\n There are lots of animals who can do that.\n\n12:14.800 --> 12:19.840\n But what we do with that coordination is unique\n\n12:20.560 --> 12:24.560\n because of some of the structural features in our brains.\n\n12:25.120 --> 12:29.040\n And it's not that other animals\n\n12:29.040 --> 12:30.560\n don't have those structural features.\n\n12:30.560 --> 12:32.480\n It's we have them in abundance.\n\n12:33.440 --> 12:38.000\n So the human brain is not larger\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:42.560\n than you would expect it to be for a primate of our size.\n\n12:42.560 --> 12:47.120\n If you took a chimpanzee and you grew it\n\n12:47.120 --> 12:51.520\n to the size of a human, that chimpanzee would have a brain\n\n12:51.520 --> 12:53.600\n that was the size of a human brain.\n\n12:53.600 --> 12:56.000\n So there's nothing special about our brain\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:57.360\n in terms of its size.\n\n12:57.360 --> 12:59.680\n There's nothing special about our brain\n\n12:59.680 --> 13:04.000\n in terms of the basic blueprint\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.800\n that builds our brain from an embryo\n\n13:06.800 --> 13:10.640\n is the basic blueprint that builds all mammalian brains\n\n13:10.640 --> 13:12.560\n and maybe even all vertebrate brains.\n\n13:14.160 --> 13:17.360\n It's just that because of its size\n\n13:17.360 --> 13:19.120\n and particularly because of the size\n\n13:19.120 --> 13:22.640\n of the cerebral cortex, which is a part\n\n13:23.200 --> 13:27.680\n that people mistakenly attribute to rationality.\n\n13:27.680 --> 13:29.360\n Why mistakenly?\n\n13:29.360 --> 13:31.600\n Is that where all the clever stuff happens?\n\n13:31.600 --> 13:33.520\n Well, no, it really isn't.\n\n13:33.520 --> 13:36.240\n And I will also say that lots of clever stuff happens\n\n13:36.240 --> 13:38.560\n in animals who don't have a cerebral cortex.\n\n13:38.560 --> 13:43.560\n But because of the size of the cerebral cortex\n\n13:43.920 --> 13:46.240\n and because of some of the features\n\n13:46.240 --> 13:49.680\n that are enhanced by that size,\n\n13:49.680 --> 13:52.560\n that gives us the capacity to do things\n\n13:52.560 --> 13:57.560\n like build civilizations and coordinate with each other,\n\n13:57.560 --> 14:01.600\n not just to manipulate the physical world,\n\n14:01.600 --> 14:05.920\n but to add to it in very profound ways.\n\n14:05.920 --> 14:09.040\n Like, other animals can cooperate with each other\n\n14:09.040 --> 14:10.080\n and use tools.\n\n14:11.040 --> 14:14.240\n We draw a line in the sand and we make countries\n\n14:14.240 --> 14:19.240\n and then we create citizens and immigrants.\n\n14:20.240 --> 14:21.760\n But also ideas.\n\n14:21.760 --> 14:24.400\n I mean, the countries are centered around the concept\n\n14:24.400 --> 14:25.840\n of like ideas.\n\n14:25.840 --> 14:28.880\n Well, what do you think a citizen is and an immigrant?\n\n14:28.880 --> 14:30.000\n Those are ideas.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:33.760\n Those are ideas that we impose on reality\n\n14:33.760 --> 14:34.720\n and make them real.\n\n14:34.720 --> 14:38.640\n And then they have very, very serious and real effects,\n\n14:38.640 --> 14:40.280\n physical effects on people.\n\n14:40.280 --> 14:42.160\n What do you think about the idea\n\n14:42.160 --> 14:43.680\n that a bunch of people have written about,\n\n14:43.680 --> 14:48.320\n Dawkins with memes, which is like ideas are breeding.\n\n14:48.320 --> 14:53.320\n Like, we're just like the canvas for ideas to breed\n\n14:53.320 --> 14:54.760\n in our brains.\n\n14:54.760 --> 14:57.880\n So this kind of network that you talk about of brains\n\n14:57.880 --> 14:59.720\n is just a little canvas for ideas\n\n14:59.720 --> 15:02.600\n to then compete against each other and so on.\n\n15:02.600 --> 15:07.600\n I think as a rhetorical tool, it's cool to think that way.\n\n15:08.080 --> 15:10.800\n So I think it was Michael Pollan.\n\n15:10.800 --> 15:12.960\n I don't remember if it was in the Botany of Desire,\n\n15:12.960 --> 15:15.960\n but it was in one of his early books on botany\n\n15:18.440 --> 15:23.440\n and gardening where he wrote about plants\n\n15:23.440 --> 15:28.440\n and he wrote about plants utilizing humans\n\n15:29.440 --> 15:32.640\n for their own evolutionary purposes.\n\n15:32.640 --> 15:33.640\n Which is kind of interesting.\n\n15:33.640 --> 15:36.520\n You can think about a human gut in a sense\n\n15:36.520 --> 15:41.520\n as a propagation device for the seeds of tomatoes\n\n15:42.760 --> 15:43.760\n and what have you.\n\n15:43.760 --> 15:44.800\n So it's kind of cool.\n\n15:45.840 --> 15:48.760\n So I think rhetorically it's an interesting device,\n\n15:48.760 --> 15:53.760\n but ideas are, as far as I know, invented by humans,\n\n15:55.080 --> 15:57.040\n propagated by humans.\n\n15:58.240 --> 16:01.880\n So I don't think they're separate from human brains\n\n16:01.880 --> 16:04.640\n in any way, although it is interesting\n\n16:04.640 --> 16:06.840\n to think about it that way.\n\n16:06.840 --> 16:09.680\n Well, of course, the ideas that are using your brain\n\n16:09.680 --> 16:11.840\n to communicate and write excellent books.\n\n16:13.160 --> 16:17.200\n And they basically picked you, Lisa,\n\n16:17.200 --> 16:21.360\n as an effective communicator and thereby are winning.\n\n16:21.360 --> 16:23.120\n So that's an interesting worldview\n\n16:24.440 --> 16:27.160\n to think that there's particular aspects of your brain\n\n16:28.120 --> 16:31.360\n that are conducive to certain sets of ideas\n\n16:31.360 --> 16:33.440\n and maybe those ideas will win out.\n\n16:33.440 --> 16:35.520\n Yeah, I think the way that I would say it really though\n\n16:35.520 --> 16:38.160\n is that there are many species of animals\n\n16:38.160 --> 16:40.280\n that influence each other's nervous systems,\n\n16:40.280 --> 16:42.360\n that regulate each other's nervous systems,\n\n16:42.360 --> 16:44.640\n and they mainly do it by physical means.\n\n16:44.640 --> 16:47.600\n They do it by chemicals, scent.\n\n16:47.600 --> 16:51.880\n They do it by, so termites and ants and bees,\n\n16:51.880 --> 16:55.280\n for example, use chemical scents.\n\n16:55.280 --> 16:59.520\n Mammals like rodents use scent\n\n16:59.520 --> 17:02.600\n and they also use hearing, audition,\n\n17:02.600 --> 17:04.160\n and that little bit of vision.\n\n17:05.040 --> 17:08.440\n Primates, nonhuman primates add vision, right?\n\n17:09.400 --> 17:13.520\n And I think everybody uses touch.\n\n17:13.520 --> 17:16.000\n Humans, as far as I know, are the only species\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:20.800\n that use ideas and words to regulate each other, right?\n\n17:20.800 --> 17:24.520\n I can text something to someone halfway around the world.\n\n17:24.520 --> 17:26.160\n They don't have to hear my voice.\n\n17:26.160 --> 17:27.800\n They don't have to see my face\n\n17:27.800 --> 17:30.680\n and I can have an effect on their nervous system.\n\n17:30.680 --> 17:35.000\n And ideas, the ideas that we communicate with words,\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:36.720\n I mean, words are in a sense a way\n\n17:36.720 --> 17:39.200\n for us to do mental telepathy with each other, right?\n\n17:39.200 --> 17:41.760\n I mean, I'm not the first person to say that obviously,\n\n17:41.760 --> 17:45.520\n but how do I control your heart rate?\n\n17:45.520 --> 17:46.760\n How do I control your breathing?\n\n17:46.760 --> 17:49.960\n How do I control your actions with words?\n\n17:49.960 --> 17:52.680\n It's because those words are communicating ideas.\n\n17:54.120 --> 17:57.840\n So you also write, I think, let's go back to the brain.\n\n17:57.840 --> 17:59.960\n You write that Plato gave us the idea\n\n17:59.960 --> 18:04.960\n that the human brain has three brains in it, three forces,\n\n18:05.240 --> 18:08.320\n which is kind of a compelling notion.\n\n18:08.320 --> 18:09.440\n You disagree.\n\n18:09.440 --> 18:12.640\n First of all, what are the three parts of the brain\n\n18:12.640 --> 18:16.000\n and why do you disagree?\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:20.600\n So Plato's description of the psyche,\n\n18:20.600 --> 18:22.800\n which for the moment we'll just assume\n\n18:22.800 --> 18:24.640\n is the same as a mind.\n\n18:24.640 --> 18:27.600\n There are some scholars who would say a soul, a psyche,\n\n18:27.600 --> 18:29.760\n a mind, those aren't actually all the same thing\n\n18:29.760 --> 18:34.000\n in ancient Greece, but we'll just for now gloss over that.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.360\n So Plato's idea was that,\n\n18:36.360 --> 18:41.360\n and it was a description of really about moral behavior\n\n18:41.680 --> 18:44.040\n and moral responsibility in humans.\n\n18:44.040 --> 18:47.240\n So the idea was that the human psyche can be described\n\n18:47.240 --> 18:52.240\n with a metaphor of two horses and a charioteer.\n\n18:53.640 --> 18:56.560\n So one horse for instincts,\n\n18:57.560 --> 19:02.560\n like feeding and fighting and fleeing and reproduction.\n\n19:02.560 --> 19:07.000\n I'm trying to control my salty language,\n\n19:09.120 --> 19:11.000\n which apparently they print in England.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:14.720\n Like I actually tossed off a fairly.\n\n19:14.720 --> 19:15.560\n F, S?\n\n19:15.560 --> 19:17.880\n Yeah, F, F, yeah.\n\n19:17.880 --> 19:19.080\n I was like, you printed that?\n\n19:19.080 --> 19:20.360\n I couldn't believe you printed that.\n\n19:20.360 --> 19:22.000\n Without like the stars or whatever?\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:23.920\n No, no, no, it was full print.\n\n19:23.920 --> 19:28.480\n They also printed a B word and it was really, yeah.\n\n19:28.480 --> 19:32.240\n Well, we should learn something from England.\n\n19:32.240 --> 19:34.360\n Indeed, anyways, but instincts.\n\n19:34.360 --> 19:37.920\n And then the other horse represents emotions.\n\n19:37.920 --> 19:40.080\n And then the charioteer represents rationality,\n\n19:40.080 --> 19:43.640\n which controls the two beasts, right?\n\n19:43.640 --> 19:48.640\n And fast forward a couple of centuries\n\n19:49.440 --> 19:54.440\n and in the middle of the 20th century,\n\n19:54.440 --> 19:57.960\n there was a very popular view of brain evolution,\n\n19:57.960 --> 20:02.960\n which suggested that you have this reptilian core,\n\n20:03.680 --> 20:08.280\n like an inner lizard brain for instincts.\n\n20:08.280 --> 20:10.880\n And then wrapped around that evolved,\n\n20:10.880 --> 20:15.880\n layer on top of that evolved a limbic system in mammals.\n\n20:16.120 --> 20:18.680\n So the novelty was in a mammalian brain,\n\n20:18.680 --> 20:23.360\n which bestowed mammals with, gave them emotions,\n\n20:23.360 --> 20:24.600\n the capacity for emotions.\n\n20:24.600 --> 20:29.600\n And then on top of that evolved a cerebral cortex,\n\n20:32.520 --> 20:37.520\n which in largely in primates, but very large in humans.\n\n20:41.600 --> 20:46.480\n And it's not that I personally disagree.\n\n20:46.480 --> 20:49.440\n It's that as far back as the 1960s,\n\n20:49.440 --> 20:54.040\n but really by the 1970s, it was shown pretty clearly\n\n20:54.040 --> 20:55.840\n with evidence from molecular genetics.\n\n20:55.840 --> 20:59.120\n So peering into cells in the brain\n\n20:59.120 --> 21:02.960\n to look at the molecular makeup of genes\n\n21:02.960 --> 21:05.840\n that the brain did not evolve that way.\n\n21:05.840 --> 21:10.840\n And the irony is that the idea of the three layered brain\n\n21:15.760 --> 21:20.680\n with an inner lizard that hijacks your behavior\n\n21:20.680 --> 21:22.600\n and causes you to do and say things\n\n21:22.600 --> 21:24.680\n that you would otherwise not,\n\n21:24.680 --> 21:27.040\n or maybe that you will regret later.\n\n21:27.040 --> 21:30.920\n That idea became very popular,\n\n21:30.920 --> 21:35.920\n was popularized by Carl Sagan in The Dragons of Eden,\n\n21:36.840 --> 21:40.800\n which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1977,\n\n21:40.800 --> 21:42.680\n when it was already known pretty much\n\n21:42.680 --> 21:44.360\n in evolutionary neuroscience\n\n21:44.360 --> 21:46.840\n that the whole narrative was a myth.\n\n21:47.720 --> 21:50.680\n So what the narrative is on the way it evolved,\n\n21:50.680 --> 21:54.040\n but do you, I mean, again, it's that problem\n\n21:54.040 --> 21:59.040\n of it being a useful tool of conversation\n\n22:00.320 --> 22:02.320\n to say like there's a lizard brain\n\n22:02.320 --> 22:05.800\n and there's a, like if I get overly emotional on Twitter,\n\n22:05.800 --> 22:09.280\n that was the lizard brain and so on.\n\n22:09.280 --> 22:10.360\n But do you?\n\n22:10.360 --> 22:11.760\n No, I don't think it's useful.\n\n22:11.760 --> 22:13.520\n I think it's, I think that.\n\n22:13.520 --> 22:16.880\n Is it useful, is it accurate?\n\n22:16.880 --> 22:18.320\n I don't think it's accurate,\n\n22:18.320 --> 22:20.880\n and therefore I don't think it's useful.\n\n22:20.880 --> 22:22.960\n So here's what I would say.\n\n22:22.960 --> 22:27.960\n I think that the way I think about philosophy and science\n\n22:30.200 --> 22:32.720\n is that they are useful tools for living.\n\n22:34.360 --> 22:37.480\n And in order to be useful tools for living,\n\n22:39.160 --> 22:44.160\n they have to help you make good decisions.\n\n22:44.160 --> 22:47.480\n The triune brain, as it's called, this three layer brain,\n\n22:47.480 --> 22:50.240\n the idea that your brain is like an already baked cake\n\n22:50.240 --> 22:53.160\n and the cortex, cerebral cortex,\n\n22:53.160 --> 22:54.920\n just layered on top like icing.\n\n22:54.920 --> 22:59.920\n The idea, that idea is the foundation of the law\n\n23:01.280 --> 23:03.560\n in most Western countries.\n\n23:03.560 --> 23:07.920\n It's the foundation of economic theory\n\n23:07.920 --> 23:11.000\n and it's a great narrative.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.800\n It sort of fits in with what I've been saying\n\n23:13.800 --> 23:17.640\n fits our intuitions about how we work.\n\n23:17.640 --> 23:22.640\n But it also, in addition to being wrong,\n\n23:22.840 --> 23:27.840\n it lets people off the hook for nasty behavior.\n\n23:29.160 --> 23:32.040\n And it also suggests that emotions\n\n23:32.040 --> 23:35.160\n can't be a source of wisdom, which they often are.\n\n23:36.040 --> 23:39.040\n In fact, you would not wanna be around someone\n\n23:39.040 --> 23:40.720\n who didn't have emotions.\n\n23:40.720 --> 23:43.280\n That would be, that's a psychopath.\n\n23:43.280 --> 23:47.600\n I mean, that's not someone you wanna really\n\n23:49.280 --> 23:50.760\n have that person deciding your outcome.\n\n23:50.760 --> 23:54.120\n So I guess my, and I could sort of go on and on and on,\n\n23:54.120 --> 23:59.120\n but my point is that I don't think,\n\n23:59.240 --> 24:02.360\n I don't think it's a useful narrative in the end.\n\n24:03.440 --> 24:06.440\n What's the more accurate view of the brain\n\n24:06.440 --> 24:08.760\n that we should use when we're thinking about it?\n\n24:08.760 --> 24:09.680\n I'll answer that in a second,\n\n24:09.680 --> 24:12.760\n but I'll say that even our notion of what an instinct is\n\n24:12.760 --> 24:16.840\n or what a reflex is, it's not quite right, right?\n\n24:16.840 --> 24:21.840\n So if you look at evidence from ecology, for example,\n\n24:22.280 --> 24:25.680\n and you look at animals in their ecological context,\n\n24:25.680 --> 24:27.440\n what you can see is that even things\n\n24:27.440 --> 24:32.440\n which are reflexes are very context sensitive.\n\n24:33.920 --> 24:37.000\n The brains of those animals are executing\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.440\n so called instinctual actions\n\n24:39.440 --> 24:42.120\n in a very, very context sensitive way.\n\n24:42.120 --> 24:46.880\n And so even when a physician takes the,\n\n24:46.880 --> 24:49.520\n it's like the idea of your patellar reflex\n\n24:49.520 --> 24:52.200\n where they hit your patellar tendon on your knee\n\n24:52.200 --> 24:57.200\n and you kick, the force with which you kick and so on\n\n24:57.640 --> 25:00.360\n is influenced by all kinds of things.\n\n25:00.360 --> 25:05.120\n A reflex isn't like a robotic response.\n\n25:05.120 --> 25:10.120\n And so I think a better way is a way that,\n\n25:10.120 --> 25:12.000\n to think about how brains work,\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:16.320\n is the way that matches our best understanding,\n\n25:16.320 --> 25:17.760\n our best scientific understanding,\n\n25:17.760 --> 25:21.040\n which I think is really cool\n\n25:21.040 --> 25:24.360\n because it's really counterintuitive.\n\n25:24.360 --> 25:26.000\n So how I came to this view,\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.560\n and I'm certainly not the only one who holds this view.\n\n25:28.560 --> 25:31.400\n I was reading work on neuroanatomy\n\n25:31.400 --> 25:34.320\n and the view that I'm about to tell you\n\n25:34.320 --> 25:36.880\n was strongly suggested by that.\n\n25:36.880 --> 25:39.080\n And then I was reading work in signal processing,\n\n25:39.080 --> 25:41.360\n like by electrical engineering.\n\n25:41.360 --> 25:45.840\n And similarly, the work suggested that,\n\n25:45.840 --> 25:48.080\n the research suggested that the brain worked this way.\n\n25:48.080 --> 25:49.920\n And I'll just say that I was reading\n\n25:49.920 --> 25:51.360\n across multiple literatures\n\n25:51.360 --> 25:53.720\n and they were who don't speak to each other\n\n25:53.720 --> 25:55.880\n and they were all pointing in this direction.\n\n25:56.920 --> 26:00.560\n And so far, although some of the details\n\n26:00.560 --> 26:02.120\n are still up for grabs,\n\n26:02.120 --> 26:07.120\n the general gist I think is I've not come across anything yet\n\n26:07.120 --> 26:10.400\n which really violates, and I'm looking.\n\n26:11.600 --> 26:13.240\n And so the idea is something like this.\n\n26:13.240 --> 26:14.640\n It's very counterintuitive.\n\n26:15.720 --> 26:18.440\n So the way to describe it is to say\n\n26:18.440 --> 26:22.360\n that your brain doesn't react to things in the world.\n\n26:22.360 --> 26:25.360\n It's not, to us it feels like our eyes\n\n26:25.360 --> 26:27.400\n are windows on the world.\n\n26:27.400 --> 26:31.000\n We see things, we hear things, we react to them.\n\n26:32.080 --> 26:34.880\n In psychology, we call this stimulus response.\n\n26:34.880 --> 26:39.400\n So your face, your voice is a stimulus to me.\n\n26:39.400 --> 26:43.320\n I receive input and then I react to it.\n\n26:44.240 --> 26:48.400\n And I might react very automatically, system one.\n\n26:50.400 --> 26:53.920\n But I also might execute some control\n\n26:53.920 --> 26:57.360\n where I maybe stop myself from saying something\n\n26:57.360 --> 27:02.360\n or doing something and in a more reflective way\n\n27:02.520 --> 27:04.200\n execute a different action, right?\n\n27:04.200 --> 27:05.280\n That's system two.\n\n27:06.440 --> 27:08.240\n The way the brain works though,\n\n27:08.240 --> 27:10.360\n is it's predicting all the time.\n\n27:10.360 --> 27:12.760\n It's constantly talking to itself,\n\n27:12.760 --> 27:15.840\n constantly talking to your body,\n\n27:15.840 --> 27:20.840\n and it's constantly predicting what's going on in the body\n\n27:20.840 --> 27:24.520\n and what's going on in the world and making predictions\n\n27:24.520 --> 27:29.080\n and the information from your body and from the world\n\n27:29.080 --> 27:32.320\n really confirm or correct those predictions.\n\n27:32.320 --> 27:35.320\n So fundamentally the thing that the brain does\n\n27:35.320 --> 27:39.960\n most of the time is just like talking to itself\n\n27:39.960 --> 27:41.560\n and predicting stuff about the world,\n\n27:41.560 --> 27:45.680\n not like this dumb thing that just senses and responds,\n\n27:45.680 --> 27:46.520\n senses and responds.\n\n27:46.520 --> 27:48.440\n Yeah, so the way to think about it is like this.\n\n27:48.440 --> 27:52.480\n You know, your brain is trapped in a dark silent box.\n\n27:52.480 --> 27:54.700\n Yeah, that's very romantic of you.\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:57.200\n Which is your skull.\n\n27:57.200 --> 28:01.280\n And the only information that it receives\n\n28:01.280 --> 28:04.440\n from your body and from the world, right,\n\n28:04.440 --> 28:07.440\n is through the senses, through the sense organs,\n\n28:07.440 --> 28:09.200\n your eyes, your ears,\n\n28:09.200 --> 28:14.000\n and you have sensory data that comes from your body\n\n28:14.960 --> 28:17.920\n that you're largely unaware of to your brain,\n\n28:17.920 --> 28:20.240\n which we call interoceptive,\n\n28:20.240 --> 28:23.280\n as opposed to exteroceptive, which is the world around you.\n\n28:23.280 --> 28:30.280\n But your brain is receiving sense data continuously,\n\n28:31.280 --> 28:35.800\n which are the effect of some set of causes.\n\n28:37.080 --> 28:41.240\n Your brain doesn't know the cause of these sense data.\n\n28:41.240 --> 28:44.480\n It's only receiving the effects of those causes,\n\n28:44.480 --> 28:46.360\n which are the data themselves.\n\n28:46.360 --> 28:49.280\n And so your brain has to solve what philosophers call\n\n28:49.280 --> 28:51.240\n an inverse inference problem.\n\n28:51.240 --> 28:53.520\n How do you know, when you only receive\n\n28:53.520 --> 28:54.480\n the effects of something,\n\n28:54.480 --> 28:56.000\n how do you know what caused those effects?\n\n28:56.000 --> 29:00.840\n So when there's a flash of light or a change in air pressure\n\n29:00.840 --> 29:04.120\n or a tug somewhere in your body,\n\n29:04.120 --> 29:09.120\n how does your brain know what caused those events\n\n29:09.520 --> 29:13.880\n so that it knows what to do next to keep you alive and well?\n\n29:15.560 --> 29:18.520\n And the answer is that your brain has one other source\n\n29:18.520 --> 29:21.040\n of information available to it,\n\n29:21.040 --> 29:23.760\n which is your past experience.\n\n29:23.760 --> 29:28.760\n It can reconstitute in its wiring past experiences,\n\n29:30.160 --> 29:34.360\n and it can combine those past experiences in novel ways.\n\n29:34.360 --> 29:39.080\n And so we have lots of names for this in psychology.\n\n29:39.080 --> 29:40.800\n We call it memory.\n\n29:40.800 --> 29:42.400\n We call it perceptual inference.\n\n29:42.400 --> 29:44.000\n We call it simulation.\n\n29:45.800 --> 29:49.440\n It's also, we call it concepts or conceptual knowledge.\n\n29:49.440 --> 29:50.920\n We call it prediction.\n\n29:50.920 --> 29:54.840\n Basically, if we were to stop the world right now,\n\n29:54.840 --> 29:58.760\n stop time, your brain is in a state,\n\n30:00.320 --> 30:05.320\n and it's representing what it believes\n\n30:05.680 --> 30:08.440\n is going on in your body and in the world.\n\n30:08.440 --> 30:11.520\n And it's predicting what will happen next\n\n30:11.520 --> 30:13.360\n based on past experience, right?\n\n30:13.360 --> 30:15.880\n Probabilistically, what's most likely to happen.\n\n30:15.880 --> 30:20.880\n And it begins to prepare your action,\n\n30:24.200 --> 30:29.200\n and it begins to prepare your experience based,\n\n30:31.040 --> 30:34.280\n so it's anticipating the sense data it's going to receive.\n\n30:35.640 --> 30:38.160\n And then when those data come in,\n\n30:38.160 --> 30:40.240\n they either confirm that prediction\n\n30:40.240 --> 30:42.560\n and your action executes\n\n30:42.560 --> 30:44.880\n because the plan's already been made,\n\n30:44.880 --> 30:49.880\n or there's some sense data that your brain didn't predict\n\n30:51.320 --> 30:54.000\n that's unexpected, and your brain takes it in.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:55.600\n We say encodes it.\n\n30:55.600 --> 30:57.400\n We have a fancy name for that.\n\n30:57.400 --> 30:58.840\n We call it learning.\n\n30:58.840 --> 31:00.520\n Your brain learns,\n\n31:00.520 --> 31:03.880\n and it updates its storehouse of knowledge,\n\n31:03.880 --> 31:05.560\n which we call an internal model\n\n31:07.200 --> 31:08.720\n so that you can predict better next time.\n\n31:08.720 --> 31:11.280\n And it turns out that predicting and correcting,\n\n31:11.280 --> 31:14.800\n predicting and correcting is a much more metabolically\n\n31:14.800 --> 31:16.760\n efficient way to run a system\n\n31:16.760 --> 31:18.760\n than constantly reacting all the time.\n\n31:18.760 --> 31:20.120\n Because if you're constantly reacting,\n\n31:20.120 --> 31:22.760\n it means you can't anticipate in any way\n\n31:22.760 --> 31:24.200\n what's going to happen.\n\n31:24.200 --> 31:27.680\n And so the amount of uncertainty that you have to deal with\n\n31:27.680 --> 31:30.880\n is overwhelming to a nervous system.\n\n31:30.880 --> 31:32.200\n Metabolically costly.\n\n31:32.200 --> 31:33.040\n I like it.\n\n31:33.040 --> 31:34.240\n And so what is a reflex?\n\n31:34.240 --> 31:38.440\n A reflex is when your brain doesn't check\n\n31:38.440 --> 31:40.360\n against the sense data.\n\n31:40.360 --> 31:45.360\n That the potential cost to you is so great,\n\n31:45.400 --> 31:48.360\n maybe because your life is threatened,\n\n31:48.360 --> 31:50.760\n that your brain makes the prediction\n\n31:50.760 --> 31:54.400\n and executes the action without checking.\n\n31:55.240 --> 31:57.080\n Yeah, so but prediction is still at the core.\n\n31:57.080 --> 31:58.640\n That's a beautiful vision of the brain.\n\n31:58.640 --> 32:01.560\n I wonder, from almost an AI perspective,\n\n32:01.560 --> 32:03.880\n but just computationally,\n\n32:03.880 --> 32:07.000\n is the brain just mostly a prediction machine then?\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:11.240\n Like is the perception just the nice little feature\n\n32:11.240 --> 32:12.200\n added on top?\n\n32:12.200 --> 32:15.480\n Like the, both the integration\n\n32:15.480 --> 32:17.280\n of new perceptual information.\n\n32:17.280 --> 32:21.360\n I wonder how big of an impressive system is that\n\n32:21.360 --> 32:25.680\n relative to just the big predictor, model constructor.\n\n32:25.680 --> 32:28.760\n Well, I think that we can look to evolution for that,\n\n32:28.760 --> 32:32.120\n for one answer, which is that when you go back,\n\n32:32.120 --> 32:35.640\n you know, 550 million years, give or take,\n\n32:35.640 --> 32:38.720\n we, you know, the world was populated by creatures,\n\n32:38.720 --> 32:41.040\n really ruled by creatures without brains.\n\n32:43.080 --> 32:46.480\n And, you know, that's a biological statement,\n\n32:46.480 --> 32:48.360\n not a political statement.\n\n32:48.360 --> 32:49.200\n Really ruled with creatures with a.\n\n32:49.200 --> 32:50.560\n You calling dinosaurs dumb?\n\n32:50.560 --> 32:51.440\n You're talking about like.\n\n32:51.440 --> 32:53.400\n Oh no, I'm not talking about dinosaurs, honey.\n\n32:53.400 --> 32:56.760\n I'm talking way back, further back than that.\n\n32:56.760 --> 32:58.600\n Really these, there are these little,\n\n32:58.600 --> 33:01.840\n little creatures called amphioxus,\n\n33:01.840 --> 33:04.240\n which is the modern, it's a, or a lancet.\n\n33:04.240 --> 33:06.040\n That's the modern animal,\n\n33:06.040 --> 33:10.320\n but it's an animal that scientists believe is very similar\n\n33:10.320 --> 33:12.280\n to our common,\n\n33:12.280 --> 33:16.680\n the common ancestor that we share with invertebrates\n\n33:16.680 --> 33:21.120\n because, basically because of the tracing back,\n\n33:21.120 --> 33:23.040\n the molecular genetics and cells.\n\n33:23.040 --> 33:27.320\n And that animal had no brain.\n\n33:27.320 --> 33:30.960\n It had some cells that would later turn into a brain,\n\n33:30.960 --> 33:32.240\n but in that animal, there's no brain,\n\n33:32.240 --> 33:34.520\n but that animal also had no head,\n\n33:34.520 --> 33:36.840\n and it had no eyes, and it had no ears,\n\n33:36.840 --> 33:40.880\n and it had really, really no senses for the most part.\n\n33:40.880 --> 33:43.960\n It had very, very limited sense of touch.\n\n33:43.960 --> 33:47.480\n It had an eye spot for, not for seeing,\n\n33:47.480 --> 33:50.840\n but just for entraining to circadian rhythm,\n\n33:50.840 --> 33:52.040\n to light and dark.\n\n33:52.920 --> 33:54.480\n And it had no hearing.\n\n33:54.480 --> 33:56.000\n It had a vestibular cell\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:58.160\n so that it could keep upright in the water.\n\n33:58.160 --> 34:02.800\n So at the time, we're talking evolutionary scale here,\n\n34:02.800 --> 34:07.000\n so give or take some 100 million years or something,\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.080\n but at the time, what are the vertebrate,\n\n34:09.080 --> 34:13.280\n like when a backbone evolved and a brain evolved,\n\n34:13.280 --> 34:18.280\n a full brain, that was when a head evolved with sense organs\n\n34:19.160 --> 34:22.160\n and when that's when your viscera,\n\n34:22.160 --> 34:23.760\n like internal systems involved.\n\n34:23.760 --> 34:28.540\n So the answer I would say is that senses,\n\n34:30.120 --> 34:31.080\n motor neuroscientists,\n\n34:31.080 --> 34:33.680\n people who study the control of motor behavior\n\n34:34.880 --> 34:39.880\n believe that senses evolved in the service of motor action.\n\n34:41.520 --> 34:44.400\n So the idea is that,\n\n34:44.400 --> 34:49.400\n like what triggered, what was the big evolutionary change?\n\n34:49.400 --> 34:53.360\n What was the big pressure that made it useful\n\n34:53.360 --> 34:56.840\n to have eyes and ears and a visual system\n\n34:56.840 --> 34:59.240\n and an auditory system and a brain basically?\n\n34:59.240 --> 35:04.240\n And the answer that is commonly entertained right now\n\n35:05.320 --> 35:07.560\n is that it was predation,\n\n35:07.560 --> 35:11.880\n that when at some point an animal evolved\n\n35:11.880 --> 35:14.680\n that deliberately ate another animal\n\n35:14.680 --> 35:19.680\n and this launched an arms race between predators and prey\n\n35:20.080 --> 35:24.080\n and it became very useful to have senses, right?\n\n35:24.080 --> 35:29.080\n So these little amphioxies don't really have,\n\n35:32.760 --> 35:36.560\n they're not aware of their environment very much, really.\n\n35:36.560 --> 35:41.560\n And so being able to look up ahead and ask yourself,\n\n35:46.480 --> 35:51.480\n should I eat that or will it eat me is a very useful thing.\n\n35:53.480 --> 35:58.480\n So the idea is that sense data\n\n35:59.240 --> 36:01.160\n is not there for consciousness.\n\n36:01.160 --> 36:03.920\n It didn't evolve for the purposes of consciousness.\n\n36:03.920 --> 36:07.440\n It didn't evolve for the purposes of experiencing anything.\n\n36:08.800 --> 36:13.360\n It evolved to be in the service of motor control.\n\n36:13.360 --> 36:16.920\n However, maybe it's useful.\n\n36:18.200 --> 36:23.200\n This is why scientists sometimes avoid questions\n\n36:23.720 --> 36:25.520\n about why things evolved.\n\n36:25.520 --> 36:28.400\n This is what philosophers call this teleology.\n\n36:28.400 --> 36:33.360\n You might be able to say something about how things evolve,\n\n36:33.360 --> 36:35.800\n but not necessarily why.\n\n36:35.800 --> 36:38.680\n We don't really know the why.\n\n36:38.680 --> 36:40.480\n That's all speculation.\n\n36:40.480 --> 36:42.080\n But the why is kind of nice here.\n\n36:42.080 --> 36:44.240\n The interesting thing is,\n\n36:44.240 --> 36:47.400\n that was the first element of social interaction is,\n\n36:47.400 --> 36:50.360\n am I gonna eat you or are you gonna eat me?\n\n36:50.360 --> 36:55.360\n And for that, it's useful to be able to see each other,\n\n36:55.560 --> 36:56.580\n sense each other.\n\n36:57.720 --> 37:00.680\n That's kind of fascinating that there was a time\n\n37:00.680 --> 37:03.040\n when life didn't eat each other.\n\n37:03.040 --> 37:04.760\n Or they did by accident.\n\n37:04.760 --> 37:06.760\n So an amphioxus, for example,\n\n37:08.600 --> 37:11.300\n it kind of like gyrates in the water,\n\n37:11.300 --> 37:14.620\n and then it plants itself in the sand\n\n37:14.620 --> 37:17.040\n like a living blade of grass,\n\n37:17.040 --> 37:21.460\n and then it just filters whatever comes into its mouth.\n\n37:21.460 --> 37:25.960\n So it is eating, but it's not actively hunting.\n\n37:25.960 --> 37:30.960\n And when the concentration of food decreases,\n\n37:30.960 --> 37:35.280\n the amphioxus can sense this.\n\n37:35.280 --> 37:40.280\n And so it basically wriggles itself randomly\n\n37:40.640 --> 37:41.760\n to some other spot,\n\n37:41.760 --> 37:44.700\n which probabilistically will have more food\n\n37:44.700 --> 37:46.040\n than wherever it is.\n\n37:46.040 --> 37:51.040\n So it's not guiding its actions on the basis of,\n\n37:52.320 --> 37:55.920\n we would say there's no real intentional action\n\n37:55.920 --> 37:58.560\n in the traditional sense.\n\n37:58.560 --> 38:02.600\n Speaking of intentional action, and if the brain is,\n\n38:02.600 --> 38:05.960\n if prediction is indeed a core component of the brain,\n\n38:05.960 --> 38:09.560\n let me ask you a question that scientists also hate\n\n38:09.560 --> 38:11.640\n is about free will.\n\n38:11.640 --> 38:15.520\n So how does, do you think about free will much?\n\n38:15.520 --> 38:19.480\n How does that fit into this, into your view of the brain?\n\n38:19.480 --> 38:24.480\n Why does it feel like we make decisions in this world?\n\n38:24.960 --> 38:26.960\n This is a hard, we scientists hate this,\n\n38:26.960 --> 38:28.800\n this is a hard question we don't have the answer to.\n\n38:28.800 --> 38:30.360\n Have you taken a side?\n\n38:30.360 --> 38:31.680\n I think I have. Do you have free will?\n\n38:31.680 --> 38:32.920\n I think I have taken a side,\n\n38:32.920 --> 38:37.920\n but I don't put a lot of stock in my own intuitions\n\n38:37.960 --> 38:41.000\n or anybody's intuitions about the cause of things.\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:42.880\n One thing we know about the brain for sure\n\n38:42.880 --> 38:46.320\n is that the brain creates experiences for us.\n\n38:46.320 --> 38:47.900\n My brain creates experiences for me,\n\n38:47.900 --> 38:49.940\n your brain creates experiences for you\n\n38:49.940 --> 38:53.720\n in a way that lures you to believe that those experiences\n\n38:53.720 --> 38:56.280\n actually reveals the way that it works,\n\n38:56.280 --> 38:57.240\n but it doesn't.\n\n38:59.640 --> 39:01.640\n So you don't trust your own intuition about free will?\n\n39:01.640 --> 39:03.760\n Not really, not really.\n\n39:03.760 --> 39:07.320\n No, I mean, no, but I am also somewhat persuaded by,\n\n39:07.320 --> 39:09.640\n I think Dan Dennett wrote at one point,\n\n39:11.760 --> 39:16.040\n the philosopher Dan Dennett wrote at one point that it's,\n\n39:16.040 --> 39:18.080\n I can't say it as eloquently as him,\n\n39:18.080 --> 39:20.760\n but people obviously have free will,\n\n39:20.760 --> 39:22.540\n they are obviously making choices.\n\n39:22.540 --> 39:27.540\n So there is this observation that we're not robots\n\n39:27.960 --> 39:29.440\n and we can do some things\n\n39:29.440 --> 39:31.800\n like a little more sophisticated than an amphioxus.\n\n39:31.800 --> 39:35.200\n So here's what I would say.\n\n39:35.200 --> 39:39.480\n I would say that your predictions,\n\n39:39.480 --> 39:43.680\n your internal model that's running right now,\n\n39:43.680 --> 39:46.920\n your ability to understand the sounds that I'm making\n\n39:46.920 --> 39:50.460\n and attach them to ideas is based on the fact\n\n39:50.460 --> 39:54.360\n that you have years of experience\n\n39:54.360 --> 39:55.880\n knowing what these sounds mean\n\n39:55.880 --> 40:00.880\n in a particular statistical pattern, right?\n\n40:01.040 --> 40:03.220\n I mean, that's how you can understand the words\n\n40:03.220 --> 40:06.280\n that are coming out of my mouth.\n\n40:06.280 --> 40:09.320\n Right, I think we did this once before too, didn't we?\n\n40:09.320 --> 40:10.160\n When we were.\n\n40:10.160 --> 40:12.400\n I don't know, I would have to access my memory module.\n\n40:12.400 --> 40:14.280\n I think when I was in your, when I.\n\n40:14.280 --> 40:15.120\n The class thing?\n\n40:15.120 --> 40:18.440\n Yeah, I think we did it just like that actually, so bravo.\n\n40:18.440 --> 40:21.520\n Wow, I have to go look back to the tape.\n\n40:21.520 --> 40:25.560\n Yeah, anyways, the idea though\n\n40:25.560 --> 40:28.860\n is that your brain is using past experience\n\n40:28.860 --> 40:32.020\n and it can use past experience in,\n\n40:33.560 --> 40:36.200\n so it's remembering, but you're not consciously remembering.\n\n40:36.200 --> 40:40.080\n It's basically re implementing prior experiences\n\n40:40.080 --> 40:42.120\n as a way of predicting what's gonna happen next.\n\n40:42.120 --> 40:44.720\n And it can do something called conceptual combination,\n\n40:44.720 --> 40:48.240\n which is it can take bits and pieces of the past\n\n40:48.240 --> 40:50.280\n and combine it in new ways.\n\n40:50.280 --> 40:55.280\n So you can experience and make sense of things\n\n40:55.720 --> 40:57.600\n that you've never encountered before\n\n40:57.600 --> 41:00.640\n because you've encountered something similar to them.\n\n41:04.160 --> 41:09.160\n And so a brain in a sense is not just,\n\n41:10.900 --> 41:13.000\n doesn't just contain information.\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:14.840\n It is information gaining,\n\n41:14.840 --> 41:17.880\n meaning it can create new information\n\n41:17.880 --> 41:19.600\n by this generative process.\n\n41:19.600 --> 41:20.820\n So in a sense, you could say, well,\n\n41:20.820 --> 41:23.260\n that maybe that's a source of free will.\n\n41:23.260 --> 41:25.760\n But I think really where free will comes from\n\n41:25.760 --> 41:27.320\n or the kind of free will that I think\n\n41:27.320 --> 41:29.440\n is worth having a conversation about\n\n41:32.160 --> 41:36.400\n involves cultivating experiences for yourself\n\n41:36.400 --> 41:40.200\n that change your internal model.\n\n41:40.200 --> 41:42.940\n When you were born and you were raised\n\n41:42.940 --> 41:47.940\n in a particular context, your brain wired itself\n\n41:48.680 --> 41:51.640\n to your surroundings, to your physical surroundings\n\n41:51.640 --> 41:53.480\n and also to your social surroundings.\n\n41:53.480 --> 41:57.340\n So you were handed an internal model basically.\n\n41:58.300 --> 42:01.520\n But when you grow up,\n\n42:01.520 --> 42:05.560\n the more control you have over where you are\n\n42:05.560 --> 42:10.200\n and what you do, you can cultivate new experiences\n\n42:10.200 --> 42:11.500\n for yourself.\n\n42:11.500 --> 42:16.500\n And those new experiences can change your internal model.\n\n42:16.520 --> 42:21.080\n And you can actually practice those experiences\n\n42:21.080 --> 42:24.280\n in a way that makes them automatic,\n\n42:24.280 --> 42:26.840\n meaning it makes it easier for the brain,\n\n42:26.840 --> 42:28.920\n your brain to make them again.\n\n42:28.920 --> 42:33.480\n And I think that that is something like\n\n42:33.480 --> 42:35.320\n what you would call free will.\n\n42:35.320 --> 42:40.320\n You aren't responsible for the model that you were handed,\n\n42:40.320 --> 42:45.320\n that someone, your caregivers cultivated a model\n\n42:46.120 --> 42:47.160\n in your brain.\n\n42:47.160 --> 42:49.280\n You're not responsible for that model,\n\n42:49.280 --> 42:52.400\n but you are responsible for the one you have now.\n\n42:52.400 --> 42:56.320\n You can choose, you choose what you expose yourself to.\n\n42:56.320 --> 42:59.360\n You choose how you spend your time.\n\n42:59.360 --> 43:02.080\n Not everybody has choice over everything,\n\n43:02.080 --> 43:04.480\n but everybody has a little bit of choice.\n\n43:04.480 --> 43:09.480\n And so I think that is something that I think\n\n43:11.640 --> 43:13.520\n is arguably called free will.\n\n43:13.520 --> 43:18.340\n Yeah, the ripple effects of the billions of decisions\n\n43:18.340 --> 43:23.340\n you make early on in life are so great\n\n43:23.720 --> 43:27.400\n that even if it's not,\n\n43:27.400 --> 43:30.280\n even if it's like all deterministic,\n\n43:30.280 --> 43:35.280\n just the amount of possibilities that are created\n\n43:35.680 --> 43:38.480\n and then the focusing on those possibilities\n\n43:38.480 --> 43:40.140\n into a single trajectory,\n\n43:41.600 --> 43:45.000\n that somewhere within that, that's free will.\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.340\n Even if it's all deterministic,\n\n43:47.340 --> 43:51.920\n that might as well be just the number of choices\n\n43:51.920 --> 43:53.800\n that are possible and the fact that you just make\n\n43:53.800 --> 43:56.200\n one trajectory to those set of choices\n\n43:56.200 --> 43:58.200\n seems to be like something like\n\n43:58.200 --> 43:59.480\n they'll be called free will.\n\n43:59.480 --> 44:02.200\n But it's still kind of sad to think like\n\n44:02.200 --> 44:03.880\n there doesn't seem to be a place\n\n44:03.880 --> 44:05.800\n where there's magic in there,\n\n44:05.800 --> 44:08.120\n where it is all just the computer.\n\n44:08.120 --> 44:10.680\n Well, there's lots of magic, I would say, so far,\n\n44:10.680 --> 44:12.840\n because we don't really understand\n\n44:13.720 --> 44:18.500\n how all of this is exactly played out at a,\n\n44:20.740 --> 44:23.060\n I mean, scientists are working hard\n\n44:23.060 --> 44:26.120\n and disagree about some of the details\n\n44:26.120 --> 44:28.520\n under the hood of what I just described,\n\n44:28.520 --> 44:31.360\n but I think there's quite a bit of magic actually.\n\n44:31.360 --> 44:36.360\n And also there's also stochastic firing of,\n\n44:38.160 --> 44:42.700\n neurons don't, they're not purely digital\n\n44:42.700 --> 44:45.100\n in the sense that there is,\n\n44:45.100 --> 44:47.600\n there's also analog communication between neurons,\n\n44:47.600 --> 44:48.840\n not just digital.\n\n44:48.840 --> 44:51.960\n So it's not just with firing of axons.\n\n44:51.960 --> 44:55.680\n And some of that, there are other ways to communicate.\n\n44:55.680 --> 45:00.680\n And also there's noise in the system\n\n45:01.640 --> 45:04.200\n and the noise is there for a really good reason.\n\n45:04.200 --> 45:08.560\n And that is the more variability there is,\n\n45:08.560 --> 45:12.320\n the more potential there is for your brain\n\n45:12.320 --> 45:15.600\n to be able to be information bearing.\n\n45:15.600 --> 45:20.340\n So basically, there are some animals\n\n45:20.340 --> 45:22.720\n that have clusters of cells.\n\n45:22.720 --> 45:25.600\n The only job is to inject noise.\n\n45:25.600 --> 45:27.960\n You know, into their neural patterns.\n\n45:27.960 --> 45:30.200\n So maybe noise is the source of free will.\n\n45:30.200 --> 45:34.560\n So you can think about stochasticity or noise\n\n45:34.560 --> 45:36.760\n as a source of free will,\n\n45:36.760 --> 45:40.480\n or you can think of conceptual combination\n\n45:40.480 --> 45:42.320\n as a source of free will.\n\n45:42.320 --> 45:45.780\n You can certainly think about cultivating,\n\n45:46.720 --> 45:49.200\n you know, you can't reach back into your past\n\n45:49.200 --> 45:51.080\n and change your past.\n\n45:51.080 --> 45:54.280\n You know, people try by psychotherapy and so on,\n\n45:54.280 --> 45:57.360\n but what you can do is change your present,\n\n45:59.240 --> 46:01.080\n which becomes your past.\n\n46:02.120 --> 46:03.760\n Right?\n\n46:03.760 --> 46:08.040\n So one way to think about it is that you're continuously,\n\n46:08.040 --> 46:10.800\n this is a colleague of mine, a friend of mine said,\n\n46:10.800 --> 46:12.560\n so what you're saying is that people\n\n46:12.560 --> 46:15.640\n are continually cultivating their past.\n\n46:15.640 --> 46:17.200\n And I was like, that's very poetic.\n\n46:17.200 --> 46:21.200\n Yes, you are continually cultivating your past\n\n46:21.200 --> 46:24.440\n as a means of controlling your future.\n\n46:26.760 --> 46:29.700\n So you think, yeah, I guess the construction\n\n46:29.700 --> 46:32.880\n of the mental model that you use for prediction\n\n46:32.880 --> 46:36.660\n ultimately contains within it your perception of the past,\n\n46:36.660 --> 46:38.800\n like the way you interpret the past,\n\n46:38.800 --> 46:41.860\n or even just the entirety of your narrative about the past.\n\n46:41.860 --> 46:44.560\n So you're constantly rewriting the story of your past.\n\n46:45.480 --> 46:46.960\n Oh boy.\n\n46:46.960 --> 46:48.080\n Yeah.\n\n46:48.080 --> 46:51.120\n That's one poetic and also just awe inspiring.\n\n46:51.120 --> 46:55.320\n What about the other thing you talk about?\n\n46:55.320 --> 46:57.280\n You've mentioned about sensory perception\n\n46:57.280 --> 47:00.760\n as a thing that like is just,\n\n47:00.760 --> 47:03.600\n you have to infer about the sources of the thing\n\n47:03.600 --> 47:07.560\n that you have perceived through your senses.\n\n47:07.560 --> 47:12.160\n So let me ask another ridiculous question.\n\n47:12.160 --> 47:14.200\n Is anything real at all?\n\n47:14.200 --> 47:15.720\n Like, how do we know it's real?\n\n47:15.720 --> 47:19.080\n How do we make sense of the fact that just like you said,\n\n47:19.080 --> 47:21.320\n there's this brain sitting alone in the darkness\n\n47:21.320 --> 47:23.160\n trying to perceive the world.\n\n47:23.160 --> 47:27.200\n How do we know that the world is out there to be perceived?\n\n47:27.200 --> 47:30.360\n Yeah, so I don't think that you should be asking questions\n\n47:30.360 --> 47:32.520\n like that without passing a joint.\n\n47:32.520 --> 47:33.760\n Right, no, for sure.\n\n47:33.760 --> 47:36.200\n I actually did before this, so I apologize.\n\n47:36.200 --> 47:37.640\n Okay, no, well, that's okay.\n\n47:37.640 --> 47:38.720\n You apologize for not sharing.\n\n47:38.720 --> 47:39.560\n That's okay.\n\n47:39.560 --> 47:41.080\n So, I mean, here's what I would say.\n\n47:41.080 --> 47:43.280\n What I would say is that the reason why\n\n47:43.280 --> 47:46.120\n we can be pretty sure that there's a there there\n\n47:46.120 --> 47:51.120\n is that the structure of the information in the world,\n\n47:51.600 --> 47:53.920\n what we call statistical regularities\n\n47:53.920 --> 47:56.040\n in sights and sounds and so on,\n\n47:56.040 --> 47:57.840\n and the structure of the information\n\n47:57.840 --> 48:00.640\n that comes from your body, it's not random stuff.\n\n48:00.640 --> 48:02.000\n There's a structure to it.\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:05.040\n There's a spatial structure and a temporal structure.\n\n48:05.040 --> 48:08.640\n And that spatial and temporal structure wires your brain.\n\n48:08.640 --> 48:13.000\n So an infant brain is not a miniature adult brain.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:16.800\n It's a brain that is waiting for wiring instructions\n\n48:16.800 --> 48:18.320\n from the world.\n\n48:18.320 --> 48:21.400\n And it must receive those wiring instructions\n\n48:21.400 --> 48:23.960\n to develop in a typical way.\n\n48:23.960 --> 48:27.480\n So, for example, when a newborn is born,\n\n48:27.480 --> 48:30.920\n when a newborn is born, when a baby is born,\n\n48:32.240 --> 48:36.560\n the baby can't see very well\n\n48:36.560 --> 48:39.280\n because the visual system in that baby's brain\n\n48:39.280 --> 48:41.120\n is not complete.\n\n48:42.440 --> 48:47.120\n The retina of your eye, which actually is part of your brain,\n\n48:47.120 --> 48:49.800\n has to be stimulated with photons of light.\n\n48:49.800 --> 48:53.440\n If it's not, the baby won't develop normally\n\n48:53.440 --> 48:56.240\n to be able to see in a neurotypical way.\n\n48:56.240 --> 48:57.840\n Same thing is true for hearing.\n\n48:57.840 --> 49:00.440\n The same thing is true really for all your senses.\n\n49:00.440 --> 49:05.440\n So the point is that the physical world\n\n49:05.440 --> 49:09.160\n the physical world, the sense data from the physical world\n\n49:09.160 --> 49:12.760\n wires your brain so that you have an internal model\n\n49:12.760 --> 49:16.240\n of that world so that your brain can predict well\n\n49:16.240 --> 49:19.800\n to keep you alive and well and allow you to thrive.\n\n49:19.800 --> 49:22.200\n That's fascinating that the brain is waiting\n\n49:23.200 --> 49:26.600\n for a very specific kind of set of instructions\n\n49:26.600 --> 49:27.440\n from the world.\n\n49:27.440 --> 49:29.040\n Like not the specific,\n\n49:29.040 --> 49:31.880\n but a very specific kind of instructions.\n\n49:31.880 --> 49:35.120\n So scientists call it expectable input.\n\n49:35.120 --> 49:39.320\n The brain needs some input in order to develop normally.\n\n49:39.320 --> 49:44.320\n And we are genetically, as I say in the book,\n\n49:44.760 --> 49:48.320\n we have the kind of nature that requires nurture.\n\n49:48.320 --> 49:53.200\n We can't develop normally without sensory input\n\n49:53.200 --> 49:55.240\n from the world and from the body.\n\n49:55.240 --> 49:57.960\n And what's really interesting about humans\n\n49:57.960 --> 50:02.960\n and some other animals too, but really seriously in humans,\n\n50:02.960 --> 50:07.960\n is the input that we need is not just physical.\n\n50:08.040 --> 50:10.280\n It's also social.\n\n50:10.280 --> 50:14.040\n We, in order for an infant, a human infant\n\n50:14.040 --> 50:19.040\n to develop normally, that infant needs eye contact, touch.\n\n50:19.880 --> 50:22.480\n It needs certain types of smells.\n\n50:22.480 --> 50:24.640\n It needs to be cuddled.\n\n50:24.640 --> 50:25.800\n It needs, right?\n\n50:25.800 --> 50:30.800\n So without social input,\n\n50:30.800 --> 50:35.800\n that infant's brain will not wire itself\n\n50:36.800 --> 50:38.000\n in a neurotypical way.\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:41.040\n And again, I would say there are lots\n\n50:41.040 --> 50:46.040\n of cultural patterns of caring for an infant.\n\n50:46.440 --> 50:49.240\n It's not like the infant has to be cared for in one way.\n\n50:50.240 --> 50:54.880\n Whatever the social environment is for an infant,\n\n50:54.880 --> 50:59.120\n that will be reflected in that infant's internal model.\n\n50:59.120 --> 51:00.520\n So we have lots of different cultures,\n\n51:00.520 --> 51:02.760\n lots of different ways of rearing children.\n\n51:02.760 --> 51:05.640\n And that's an advantage for our species,\n\n51:05.640 --> 51:07.320\n although we don't always experience it that way.\n\n51:07.320 --> 51:09.120\n That is an advantage for our species.\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:15.000\n But if you just feed and water a baby\n\n51:15.920 --> 51:20.240\n without all the extra social doodads,\n\n51:20.240 --> 51:25.240\n what you get is a profoundly impaired human.\n\n51:25.440 --> 51:28.640\n Yeah, but nevertheless, you're kind of saying\n\n51:28.640 --> 51:33.640\n that the physical reality has a consistent thing\n\n51:34.440 --> 51:38.080\n throughout that keeps feeding these set\n\n51:38.080 --> 51:43.080\n of sensory information that our brains are constructed for.\n\n51:43.880 --> 51:44.880\n Yeah, the cool thing though,\n\n51:44.880 --> 51:47.120\n is that if you change the consistency,\n\n51:47.120 --> 51:49.720\n if you change the statistical regularities,\n\n51:49.720 --> 51:52.040\n so prediction error, your brain can learn it.\n\n51:52.040 --> 51:53.800\n It's expensive for your brain to learn it.\n\n51:53.800 --> 51:55.800\n And it takes a while for the brain\n\n51:55.800 --> 51:57.080\n to get really automated with it.\n\n51:57.080 --> 52:01.680\n But you had a wonderful conversation with David Edelman,\n\n52:01.680 --> 52:04.200\n who just published a book about this\n\n52:04.200 --> 52:07.720\n and gave lots and lots of really very, very cool examples.\n\n52:07.720 --> 52:09.840\n Some of which I actually discussed\n\n52:09.840 --> 52:11.000\n in How Emotions Were Made,\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:14.360\n but not obviously to the extent that he did in his book.\n\n52:14.360 --> 52:15.560\n It's a fascinating book,\n\n52:15.560 --> 52:20.560\n but it speaks to the point that your internal model\n\n52:21.560 --> 52:23.120\n is always under construction.\n\n52:23.120 --> 52:28.120\n And therefore, you always can modify your experience.\n\n52:30.440 --> 52:31.720\n I wonder what the limits are.\n\n52:31.720 --> 52:36.240\n Like if we put it on Mars or if we put it in virtual reality\n\n52:36.240 --> 52:39.280\n or if we sit at home during a pandemic\n\n52:39.280 --> 52:42.720\n and we spend most of our day on Twitter and TikTok,\n\n52:42.720 --> 52:45.000\n like I wonder where the breaking point,\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:48.200\n like the limitations of the brain's capacity\n\n52:48.200 --> 52:53.200\n to properly continue wiring itself.\n\n52:54.120 --> 52:56.440\n Well, I think what I would say is that\n\n52:56.440 --> 53:00.200\n there are different ways to specify your question, right?\n\n53:00.200 --> 53:01.760\n Like one way to specify it\n\n53:01.760 --> 53:05.800\n would be the way that David phrases it,\n\n53:05.800 --> 53:09.840\n which is can we create a new sense?\n\n53:09.840 --> 53:14.040\n Like can we create a new sensory modality?\n\n53:14.040 --> 53:15.520\n How hard would that be?\n\n53:15.520 --> 53:19.520\n What are the limits in doing that?\n\n53:19.520 --> 53:23.760\n But another way to say it is what happens to a brain\n\n53:23.760 --> 53:27.360\n when you remove some of those statistical regularities,\n\n53:27.360 --> 53:28.200\n right?\n\n53:28.200 --> 53:30.160\n Like what happens to an adult brain\n\n53:30.160 --> 53:35.160\n when you remove some of the statistical patterns\n\n53:36.040 --> 53:37.920\n that were there and they're not there anymore?\n\n53:37.920 --> 53:39.720\n Are you talking about in the environment\n\n53:39.720 --> 53:43.880\n or in the actual like you remove eyesight, for example?\n\n53:43.880 --> 53:44.800\n Well, either way.\n\n53:44.800 --> 53:49.800\n I mean, basically one way to limit the inputs to your brain\n\n53:49.800 --> 53:53.080\n are to stay home and protect yourself.\n\n53:53.080 --> 53:57.480\n Another way is to put someone in solitary confinement.\n\n53:57.480 --> 54:01.200\n Another way is to stick them in a nursing home.\n\n54:02.720 --> 54:06.960\n Well, not all nursing homes, but there are some, right?\n\n54:06.960 --> 54:11.960\n Which really are where people are somewhat impoverished\n\n54:11.960 --> 54:15.200\n in the interactions and the variety\n\n54:15.200 --> 54:17.440\n of sensory stimulation that they get.\n\n54:17.440 --> 54:20.960\n Another way is that you lose a sense, right?\n\n54:20.960 --> 54:25.920\n But the point is I think that the human brain\n\n54:25.920 --> 54:30.920\n really likes variety, to say it in a sort of Cartesian way.\n\n54:36.560 --> 54:39.600\n Variety is a good thing for a brain.\n\n54:39.600 --> 54:44.600\n And there are risks that you take\n\n54:48.680 --> 54:52.200\n when you restrict what you expose yourself to.\n\n54:54.080 --> 54:56.960\n Yeah, you know, there's all this talk of diversity.\n\n54:56.960 --> 55:00.360\n The brain loves it to the fullest definition\n\n55:00.360 --> 55:01.920\n and degree of diversity.\n\n55:01.920 --> 55:04.080\n Yeah, I mean, I would say the only thing,\n\n55:04.080 --> 55:07.480\n basically human brains thrive on diversity.\n\n55:07.480 --> 55:10.120\n The only place where we seem to have difficulty\n\n55:10.120 --> 55:13.680\n with diversity is with each other, right?\n\n55:13.680 --> 55:16.480\n But who wants to eat the same food every day?\n\n55:16.480 --> 55:17.440\n You never would.\n\n55:17.440 --> 55:19.360\n Who wants to wear the same clothes every day?\n\n55:19.360 --> 55:21.800\n I mean, my husband, if you ask him to close his eyes,\n\n55:21.800 --> 55:24.680\n he won't be able to tell you what he's wearing, right?\n\n55:24.680 --> 55:27.800\n He'll buy seven shirts of exactly the same style\n\n55:27.800 --> 55:30.840\n in different colors, but they are in different colors, right?\n\n55:30.840 --> 55:31.800\n It's not like he's wearing.\n\n55:31.800 --> 55:35.200\n How would you then explain my brain,\n\n55:35.200 --> 55:36.920\n which is terrified of choice\n\n55:36.920 --> 55:39.400\n and therefore wear the same thing every time?\n\n55:39.400 --> 55:41.440\n Well, you must be getting your diversity.\n\n55:41.440 --> 55:43.440\n Well, first of all, you are a fairly sharp dresser,\n\n55:43.440 --> 55:47.080\n so there is that, but you're getting some reinforcement\n\n55:47.080 --> 55:48.440\n for dressing the way you do.\n\n55:48.440 --> 55:52.400\n But no, your brain must get diversity in other places.\n\n55:52.400 --> 55:55.040\n But I think we, you know,\n\n55:56.080 --> 55:59.280\n so the two most expensive things your brain can do,\n\n55:59.280 --> 56:04.280\n metabolically speaking, is move your body and learn.\n\n56:04.280 --> 56:08.080\n And learn something new.\n\n56:08.080 --> 56:12.520\n So novelty, that is diversity, right,\n\n56:12.520 --> 56:14.280\n comes at a cost, a metabolic cost,\n\n56:14.280 --> 56:19.200\n but it's a cost, it's an investment that gives returns.\n\n56:19.200 --> 56:21.920\n And in general, people vary\n\n56:21.920 --> 56:24.480\n in how much they like novelty, unexpected things.\n\n56:24.480 --> 56:26.000\n Some people really like it.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:27.680\n Some people really don't like it,\n\n56:27.680 --> 56:29.320\n and there's everybody in between.\n\n56:29.320 --> 56:32.800\n But in general, we don't eat the same thing every day.\n\n56:32.800 --> 56:36.240\n We don't usually do exactly the same thing\n\n56:36.240 --> 56:37.840\n in exactly the same order,\n\n56:37.840 --> 56:40.520\n in exactly the same place every day.\n\n56:41.440 --> 56:43.960\n The only place we have difficulty\n\n56:43.960 --> 56:48.400\n with diversity is in each other.\n\n56:48.400 --> 56:50.800\n And then we have considerable problems there,\n\n56:50.800 --> 56:52.960\n I would say, as a species.\n\n56:52.960 --> 56:55.000\n Let me ask, I don't know if you're familiar\n\n56:55.000 --> 57:00.000\n with Donald Hoffman's work about questions of reality.\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:03.920\n What are your thoughts of the possibility\n\n57:03.920 --> 57:06.920\n that the very thing we've been talking about,\n\n57:06.920 --> 57:10.680\n of the brain wiring itself from birth\n\n57:10.680 --> 57:12.840\n to a particular set of inputs,\n\n57:12.840 --> 57:15.360\n is just a little slice of reality,\n\n57:15.360 --> 57:17.480\n that there is something much bigger out there\n\n57:17.480 --> 57:21.680\n that we humans, with our cognition, cognitive capabilities,\n\n57:21.680 --> 57:23.800\n is just not even perceiving.\n\n57:23.800 --> 57:26.880\n The thing we're perceiving is just a crappy,\n\n57:26.880 --> 57:31.880\n like Windows 95 interface onto a much bigger,\n\n57:32.200 --> 57:35.360\n richer set of complex physics\n\n57:35.360 --> 57:37.720\n that we're not even in touch with.\n\n57:38.840 --> 57:41.280\n Well, without getting too metaphysical about it,\n\n57:41.280 --> 57:42.600\n I think we know for sure.\n\n57:42.600 --> 57:47.600\n It doesn't have to be the crappy version of anything,\n\n57:47.800 --> 57:50.120\n but we definitely have a limited,\n\n57:50.120 --> 57:53.240\n we have a set of senses that are limited\n\n57:53.240 --> 57:55.080\n in very physical ways,\n\n57:55.080 --> 57:57.240\n and we're clearly not perceiving everything\n\n57:57.240 --> 57:58.600\n there is to perceive.\n\n57:58.600 --> 57:59.840\n That's clear.\n\n57:59.840 --> 58:01.560\n I mean, it's just, it's not that hard.\n\n58:01.560 --> 58:03.280\n We can't, without special,\n\n58:03.280 --> 58:04.960\n why do we invent scientific tools?\n\n58:04.960 --> 58:07.080\n It's so that we can overcome our senses\n\n58:07.080 --> 58:10.360\n and experience things that we couldn't otherwise,\n\n58:10.360 --> 58:14.200\n whether they are different parts of the visual spectrum,\n\n58:14.200 --> 58:15.200\n the light spectrum,\n\n58:15.200 --> 58:19.480\n or things that are too microscopically small for us to see\n\n58:19.480 --> 58:22.480\n or too far away for us to see.\n\n58:22.480 --> 58:25.600\n So clearly, we're only getting a slice,\n\n58:27.440 --> 58:29.480\n and that slice,\n\n58:32.360 --> 58:37.360\n the interesting or potentially sad thing about humans\n\n58:38.120 --> 58:40.640\n is that we, whatever we experience,\n\n58:40.640 --> 58:43.560\n we think there's a natural reason for experiencing it,\n\n58:44.600 --> 58:46.360\n and we think it's obvious and natural\n\n58:46.360 --> 58:48.440\n and it must be this way,\n\n58:48.440 --> 58:50.720\n and that all the other stuff isn't important.\n\n58:50.720 --> 58:52.320\n And that's clearly not true.\n\n58:53.200 --> 58:55.400\n Many of the things that we think of as natural\n\n58:55.400 --> 58:57.000\n are anything but,\n\n58:57.000 --> 59:00.240\n they're certainly real, but we've created them.\n\n59:00.240 --> 59:02.080\n They certainly have very real impacts,\n\n59:02.080 --> 59:04.280\n but we've created those impacts.\n\n59:04.280 --> 59:06.560\n And we also know that there are many things\n\n59:06.560 --> 59:10.600\n outside of our awareness that have tremendous influence\n\n59:10.600 --> 59:13.160\n on what we experience and what we do.\n\n59:13.160 --> 59:16.640\n So there's no question that that's true.\n\n59:16.640 --> 59:18.480\n I mean, just, it's,\n\n59:18.480 --> 59:22.560\n but the extent is how, really the question is,\n\n59:22.560 --> 59:23.840\n how fantastical is it?\n\n59:23.840 --> 59:26.280\n Yeah, like what, you know, a lot of people ask me,\n\n59:26.280 --> 59:27.560\n am I allowed to say this?\n\n59:27.560 --> 59:28.840\n I think I'm allowed to say this.\n\n59:28.840 --> 59:31.560\n I've eaten shrooms a couple of times,\n\n59:31.560 --> 59:33.200\n but I haven't gone the full,\n\n59:33.200 --> 59:35.720\n I'm talking to a few researchers in psychedelics.\n\n59:35.720 --> 59:37.880\n It's an interesting scientifically place.\n\n59:37.880 --> 59:40.520\n Like what is the portal you're entering\n\n59:40.520 --> 59:41.760\n when you take psychedelics?\n\n59:41.760 --> 59:45.240\n Or another way to ask is like dreams.\n\n59:45.240 --> 59:46.760\n So let me tell you what I think,\n\n59:46.760 --> 59:48.440\n which is based on nothing.\n\n59:48.440 --> 59:51.440\n Like this is based on my, right, so I don't.\n\n59:51.440 --> 59:52.400\n Your intuition.\n\n59:52.400 --> 59:56.760\n It's based on my, I'm guessing now,\n\n59:56.760 --> 59:59.320\n based on what I do know, I would say.\n\n59:59.320 --> 1:00:02.400\n But I think that, well, think about what happens.\n\n1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:04.840\n So you're running, your brain's running this internal model\n\n1:00:04.840 --> 1:00:06.680\n and it's all outside of your awareness.\n\n1:00:06.680 --> 1:00:08.280\n You see the, you feel the products,\n\n1:00:08.280 --> 1:00:10.360\n but you don't sense the,\n\n1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:13.680\n you have no awareness of the mechanics of it, right?\n\n1:00:13.680 --> 1:00:17.080\n It's going on all the time.\n\n1:00:17.080 --> 1:00:19.200\n And so one thing that's going on all the time\n\n1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:20.760\n that you're completely unaware of\n\n1:00:20.760 --> 1:00:22.720\n is that when your brain,\n\n1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:25.720\n your brain is basically asking itself,\n\n1:00:25.720 --> 1:00:27.760\n figuratively speaking, not literally, right?\n\n1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:32.160\n Like how is, the last time I was in this sensory array\n\n1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:33.960\n with this stuff going on in my body\n\n1:00:33.960 --> 1:00:37.680\n and this chain of events which just occurred,\n\n1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:39.440\n what did I do next?\n\n1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:40.680\n What did I feel next?\n\n1:00:40.680 --> 1:00:42.000\n What did I see next?\n\n1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:43.600\n It doesn't come up with one answer.\n\n1:00:43.600 --> 1:00:47.360\n It comes up with a distribution of it, possible answers.\n\n1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:50.360\n And then there has to be some selection process.\n\n1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:54.000\n And so you have a network in your brain,\n\n1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:57.560\n a sub network in your brain, a population of neurons\n\n1:00:57.560 --> 1:00:59.680\n that helps to choose.\n\n1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:03.560\n It's not, I'm not talking about a homunculus in your brain\n\n1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:05.600\n or anything silly like that.\n\n1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:08.960\n This is not the soul.\n\n1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:11.800\n It's not the center of yourself or anything like that.\n\n1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:16.800\n But there is a set of neurons\n\n1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:20.800\n that weighs the probabilities\n\n1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:26.640\n and helps to select or narrow the field, okay?\n\n1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:30.120\n And that network is working all the time.\n\n1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:32.160\n It's actually called the control network,\n\n1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:33.520\n the executive control network,\n\n1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:35.840\n or you can call it a frontoparietal\n\n1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:38.160\n because the regions of the brain that make it up\n\n1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:41.120\n are in the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe.\n\n1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:43.120\n There are also parts that belong\n\n1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:44.840\n to the subcortical parts of your brain.\n\n1:01:44.840 --> 1:01:45.680\n It doesn't really matter.\n\n1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:47.680\n The point is that there is this network\n\n1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:49.200\n and it is working all the time.\n\n1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:50.800\n Whether or not you feel in control,\n\n1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:52.680\n whether or not you feel like you're expending effort\n\n1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:53.520\n doesn't really matter.\n\n1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:56.400\n It's on all the time, except when you sleep.\n\n1:01:57.240 --> 1:02:02.080\n When you sleep, it's a little bit relaxed.\n\n1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.640\n And so think about what's happening when you sleep.\n\n1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:09.760\n When you sleep, the external world recedes,\n\n1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:11.400\n the sense data from,\n\n1:02:11.400 --> 1:02:16.000\n so basically your model becomes a little bit,\n\n1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:19.520\n the tethers from the world are loosened.\n\n1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:24.000\n And this network, which is involved in,\n\n1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:27.720\n you know, maybe weeding out unrealistic things\n\n1:02:27.720 --> 1:02:29.960\n is a little bit quiet.\n\n1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:34.040\n So use your dreams are really your internal model\n\n1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:40.040\n that's unconstrained by the immediate world.\n\n1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:43.040\n Except, so you can do things that you can't do\n\n1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:45.600\n in real life, in your dreams, right?\n\n1:02:45.600 --> 1:02:46.440\n You can fly.\n\n1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:49.320\n Like I, for example, when I fly on my back in a dream,\n\n1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:51.640\n I'm much faster than when I fly on my front.\n\n1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:53.240\n Don't ask me why, I don't know.\n\n1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:55.000\n Or when you're laying on your back in your dream.\n\n1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:58.720\n No, when I'm in my dream and flying in a dream,\n\n1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:00.800\n I am much faster flyer in the air.\n\n1:03:00.800 --> 1:03:02.040\n You fly often?\n\n1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:04.480\n Not often, but I, You talk about it like you,\n\n1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:06.400\n I don't think I've flown for many years.\n\n1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:08.000\n Well, you must try it.\n\n1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:11.480\n I've flown, I've fallen.\n\n1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:12.400\n That's scary.\n\n1:03:12.400 --> 1:03:14.440\n Yeah, but you're talking about like airplane.\n\n1:03:14.440 --> 1:03:16.600\n Yeah, I fly in my dreams.\n\n1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:18.840\n And I'm way faster, right? On your back.\n\n1:03:18.840 --> 1:03:20.320\n On my back, way faster.\n\n1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:22.560\n Now you can say, well, you know,\n\n1:03:22.560 --> 1:03:24.000\n you never flew in your life.\n\n1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:25.720\n Right, it's conceptual combination.\n\n1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:27.680\n I mean, I've flown in an airplane\n\n1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:30.280\n and I've seen birds fly\n\n1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:31.920\n and I've watched movies of people flying\n\n1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:34.280\n and I know Superman probably flies,\n\n1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:36.040\n I don't know if he flies faster on his back, but.\n\n1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:37.880\n He's, I've never seen Superman.\n\n1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:40.040\n He's always flying on his front, right, but yeah.\n\n1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:41.960\n But anyways, my point is that, you know,\n\n1:03:41.960 --> 1:03:46.480\n all of this stuff really, all of these experiences\n\n1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:48.840\n really become part of your internal model.\n\n1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:50.800\n The thing is that when you're asleep,\n\n1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:54.200\n your internal model is still being constrained\n\n1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:56.040\n by your body.\n\n1:03:56.040 --> 1:03:58.520\n Your brain's always attached to your body.\n\n1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:01.040\n It's always receiving sense data from your body.\n\n1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:04.200\n You're mostly never aware of it\n\n1:04:04.200 --> 1:04:06.640\n unless you run up the stairs\n\n1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:11.160\n or, you know, maybe you are ill in some way.\n\n1:04:11.160 --> 1:04:12.720\n But you're mostly not aware of it,\n\n1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:13.800\n which is a really good thing.\n\n1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:16.040\n Because if you were, you know,\n\n1:04:16.040 --> 1:04:17.440\n you'd never pay attention to anything\n\n1:04:17.440 --> 1:04:19.080\n outside your own skin ever again.\n\n1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:20.560\n Like right now, you seem like\n\n1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:21.840\n you're sitting there very calmly,\n\n1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:25.320\n but you have a virtual drama, right?\n\n1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:30.280\n It's like an opera going on inside your body.\n\n1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:33.520\n And so I think that one of the things\n\n1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:37.320\n that happens when people take psilocybin\n\n1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:41.760\n or take, you know, ketamine, for example,\n\n1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:46.760\n is that the tethers are completely removed.\n\n1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:48.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:48.840 --> 1:04:50.200\n That's fascinating.\n\n1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:53.480\n And that's why it's helpful to have a guide, right?\n\n1:04:53.480 --> 1:04:57.040\n Because the guide is giving you sense data\n\n1:04:57.040 --> 1:04:59.640\n to steer that internal model\n\n1:04:59.640 --> 1:05:02.560\n so that it doesn't go completely off the rails.\n\n1:05:02.560 --> 1:05:03.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:06.480\n Again, that wiring to the other brain,\n\n1:05:06.480 --> 1:05:09.840\n that's the guide, is at least a tiny little tether.\n\n1:05:09.840 --> 1:05:10.680\n Exactly.\n\n1:05:10.680 --> 1:05:11.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:14.960\n Let's talk about emotion a little bit, if we could.\n\n1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:16.960\n Emotion comes up often.\n\n1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:19.280\n And I have never spoken with anybody\n\n1:05:19.280 --> 1:05:24.280\n who has a clarity about emotion\n\n1:05:24.720 --> 1:05:29.200\n from a biological and neuroscience perspective that you do.\n\n1:05:29.200 --> 1:05:34.200\n And I'm not sure I fully know how to,\n\n1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:37.080\n as a, I mentioned this way too much,\n\n1:05:37.080 --> 1:05:40.040\n but as somebody who was born in the Soviet Union\n\n1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:42.440\n and romanticizes basically everything,\n\n1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:44.920\n talks about love nonstop,\n\n1:05:44.920 --> 1:05:48.520\n you know, emotion is a, I don't know what to make of it.\n\n1:05:48.520 --> 1:05:51.080\n I don't know what to,\n\n1:05:51.080 --> 1:05:53.960\n so maybe let's just try to talk about it.\n\n1:05:53.960 --> 1:05:56.440\n I mean, from a neuroscience perspective,\n\n1:05:56.440 --> 1:05:58.440\n we talked about it a little bit last time,\n\n1:05:58.440 --> 1:06:00.720\n your book covers it, how emotions are made,\n\n1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:05.720\n but what are some misconceptions we writers of poetry,\n\n1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:10.200\n we romanticizing humans have about emotion\n\n1:06:10.200 --> 1:06:14.440\n that we should move away from before\n\n1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:18.120\n to think about emotion from both a scientific\n\n1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:20.040\n and an engineering perspective?\n\n1:06:20.040 --> 1:06:25.040\n Yeah, so there is a common view of emotion in the West.\n\n1:06:25.040 --> 1:06:29.080\n The caricature of that view is that,\n\n1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:33.440\n you know, we have an inner beast, right?\n\n1:06:33.440 --> 1:06:37.120\n Your limbic system, your inner lizard,\n\n1:06:38.160 --> 1:06:39.360\n we have an inner beast\n\n1:06:39.360 --> 1:06:41.960\n and that comes baked in to the brain at birth.\n\n1:06:41.960 --> 1:06:44.280\n So you've got circuits for anger, sadness, fear.\n\n1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:46.800\n It's interesting that they all have English names,\n\n1:06:46.800 --> 1:06:47.960\n these circuits.\n\n1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:50.520\n But, and they're there\n\n1:06:50.520 --> 1:06:52.760\n and they're triggered by things in the world.\n\n1:06:52.760 --> 1:06:56.000\n And then they cause you to do and say,\n\n1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:59.280\n and so when your fear circuit is triggered,\n\n1:06:59.280 --> 1:07:03.120\n you widen your eyes, you gasp,\n\n1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:06.680\n your heart rate goes up,\n\n1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:10.960\n you prepare to flee or to freeze.\n\n1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:15.120\n And these are modal responses.\n\n1:07:15.120 --> 1:07:16.840\n They're not the only responses that you give,\n\n1:07:16.840 --> 1:07:19.760\n but on average, they're the prototypical responses.\n\n1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:22.160\n That's the view.\n\n1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:25.880\n And that's the view of emotion in the law.\n\n1:07:25.880 --> 1:07:27.800\n That's the view, you know,\n\n1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:31.120\n that emotions are these profoundly unhelpful things\n\n1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:34.320\n that are obligatory kind of like reflexes.\n\n1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:39.920\n The problem with that view\n\n1:07:39.920 --> 1:07:43.320\n is that it doesn't comport to the evidence.\n\n1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:46.360\n And it doesn't really matter.\n\n1:07:46.360 --> 1:07:49.160\n The evidence actually lines up beautifully with each other.\n\n1:07:49.160 --> 1:07:50.800\n It just doesn't line up with that view.\n\n1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:53.280\n And it doesn't matter whether you're measuring people's faces,\n\n1:07:53.280 --> 1:07:55.280\n facial movements, or you're measuring their body movements,\n\n1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:57.120\n or you're measuring their peripheral physiology,\n\n1:07:57.120 --> 1:07:59.360\n or you're measuring their brains\n\n1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:00.640\n or their voices or whatever.\n\n1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:03.600\n Pick any output that you wanna measure\n\n1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:05.760\n and any system you wanna measure,\n\n1:08:05.760 --> 1:08:09.080\n and you don't really find strong evidence for this.\n\n1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:13.000\n And I say this as somebody who not only has reviewed\n\n1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:17.800\n really thousands of articles and run big meta analyses,\n\n1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:21.280\n which are statistical summaries of published papers,\n\n1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:25.120\n but also as someone who has sent teams of researchers\n\n1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:29.480\n to small scale cultures,\n\n1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:32.520\n you know, remote cultures,\n\n1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:37.480\n which are very different from urban,\n\n1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:40.200\n large scale cultures like ours.\n\n1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:42.760\n And one culture that we visited,\n\n1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:47.200\n and I say we euphemistically because I myself didn't go\n\n1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:49.880\n because I only had two research permits,\n\n1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:52.160\n and I gave them to my students\n\n1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:54.880\n because I felt like it was better for them\n\n1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:56.360\n to have that experience\n\n1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:59.320\n and more formative for them to have that experience.\n\n1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:03.040\n But I was in contact with them every day by satellite phone.\n\n1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:08.040\n And this was to visit the Hadza hunter gatherers in Tanzania\n\n1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:14.840\n who are not an ancient people, they're a modern culture,\n\n1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:19.840\n but they live in circumstances, hunting and foraging,\n\n1:09:19.840 --> 1:09:24.120\n circumstances that are very similar,\n\n1:09:24.120 --> 1:09:26.960\n in similar conditions to our ancestors,\n\n1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:30.640\n hunting gathering ancestors,\n\n1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:34.480\n when expressions of emotion were supposed to have evolved,\n\n1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:37.280\n at least by one view of, okay.\n\n1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:41.200\n So, you know, for many years,\n\n1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:45.600\n I was sort of struggling with this set of observations,\n\n1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:48.240\n which is that I feel emotion,\n\n1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:52.360\n and I perceive emotion in other people,\n\n1:09:52.360 --> 1:09:55.960\n but scientists can't find a single marker,\n\n1:09:55.960 --> 1:09:57.360\n a single biomarker,\n\n1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:01.320\n not a single individual measure or pattern of measures\n\n1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:06.320\n that can predict what kind of emotional state they're in.\n\n1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:08.000\n How could that possibly be?\n\n1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.440\n How can you possibly make sense of those two things?\n\n1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:15.840\n And through a lot of reading\n\n1:10:15.840 --> 1:10:19.520\n and a lot of an immersing myself in different literatures,\n\n1:10:19.520 --> 1:10:24.320\n I came to the hypothesis that the brain\n\n1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:26.560\n is constructing these instances\n\n1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:29.320\n out of more basic ingredients.\n\n1:10:29.320 --> 1:10:32.080\n So when I tell you that the brain,\n\n1:10:32.080 --> 1:10:34.080\n when I suggest to you that what your brain is doing\n\n1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:37.000\n is making a prediction,\n\n1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:41.000\n and it's asking itself, figuratively speaking,\n\n1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.640\n the last time I was in this situation\n\n1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:46.440\n and this, you know, physical state,\n\n1:10:46.440 --> 1:10:47.600\n what did I do next?\n\n1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:48.600\n What did I see next?\n\n1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:50.040\n What did I hear next?\n\n1:10:50.040 --> 1:10:53.520\n It's basically asking what in my past\n\n1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:57.280\n is similar to the present?\n\n1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:01.360\n Things which are similar to one another\n\n1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:03.960\n are called a category.\n\n1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:05.240\n A group of things which are similar\n\n1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:07.200\n to one another is a category.\n\n1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:11.360\n And a mental representation of a category is a concept.\n\n1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:15.160\n So your brain is constructing categories or concepts\n\n1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:17.360\n on the fly continuously.\n\n1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:19.760\n So you really want to understand what a brain is doing.\n\n1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:23.160\n You don't, using machine learning like classification models\n\n1:11:23.160 --> 1:11:24.160\n is not going to help you\n\n1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:25.840\n because the brain doesn't classify.\n\n1:11:25.840 --> 1:11:28.080\n It's doing category construction.\n\n1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:31.480\n And the categories change,\n\n1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:34.000\n or you could say it's doing concept construction.\n\n1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:37.920\n It's using past experience to conjure a concept,\n\n1:11:37.920 --> 1:11:39.440\n which is a prediction.\n\n1:11:41.880 --> 1:11:45.840\n And if it's using past experiences of emotion,\n\n1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:48.400\n then it's constructing an emotion concept.\n\n1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:54.480\n Your concept will be,\n\n1:11:54.480 --> 1:12:01.480\n the content of it changes\n\n1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:03.160\n depending on the situation that you're in.\n\n1:12:03.160 --> 1:12:06.880\n So for example, if your brain uses past experiences of anger\n\n1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:10.040\n that you have learned,\n\n1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:13.480\n either because somebody labeled them for you,\n\n1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:17.560\n taught them to you, you observed them in movies and so on,\n\n1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:20.320\n in one situation could be very different\n\n1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:24.280\n from your concept of for anger than another situation.\n\n1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:29.280\n And this is how anger, instances of anger are,\n\n1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:32.520\n we call a population of variable instances.\n\n1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:34.800\n Sometimes when you're angry, you scowl.\n\n1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:38.760\n Sometimes when you're angry, you might smile.\n\n1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:42.080\n Sometimes when you're angry, you might cry.\n\n1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:44.840\n Sometimes your heart rate will go up, it will go down,\n\n1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:46.200\n it will stay the same.\n\n1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:49.040\n It depends on what action you're about to take\n\n1:12:49.040 --> 1:12:51.640\n because the way prediction, and I should say,\n\n1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:56.640\n the idea that physiology is yoked to action\n\n1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:00.160\n is a very old idea in the study\n\n1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:01.520\n of the peripheral nervous system\n\n1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:03.600\n that's been known for really decades.\n\n1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:07.280\n And so if you look at what the brain is doing,\n\n1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:09.800\n if you just look at the anatomy and you,\n\n1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:12.520\n here's the hypothesis that you would come up with.\n\n1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:14.320\n And I can go into the details.\n\n1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:18.040\n I've published these details in scientific papers\n\n1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:20.680\n and they also appear somewhat in\n\n1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:22.400\n How Emotions Were Made, my first book.\n\n1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:25.360\n They are not in the seven and a half lessons\n\n1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:29.680\n because that book is really not pitched\n\n1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:31.800\n at that level of explanation.\n\n1:13:31.800 --> 1:13:35.480\n It's just giving, it's really just a set of little essays.\n\n1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:38.680\n But the evidence, but what I'm about to say\n\n1:13:38.680 --> 1:13:41.880\n is actually based on scientific evidence.\n\n1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:46.280\n When your brain begins to form a prediction,\n\n1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:51.280\n the first thing it's doing is it's making a prediction\n\n1:13:51.280 --> 1:13:54.800\n of how to change the internal systems of your body,\n\n1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:56.920\n your heart, your cardiovascular system,\n\n1:13:56.920 --> 1:13:59.560\n the control of your heart, control of your lungs,\n\n1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:03.800\n a flush of cortisol, which is not a stress hormone.\n\n1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:05.360\n It's a hormone that gets glucose\n\n1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:08.200\n into your bloodstream very fast\n\n1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:10.800\n because your brain is predicting you need to do this.\n\n1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:13.200\n Predicting you need to do something\n\n1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:17.560\n metabolically expensive.\n\n1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:23.600\n And so either that means either move or learn, okay?\n\n1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:28.400\n And so your brain is preparing your body,\n\n1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:30.480\n the internal systems of your body\n\n1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:34.200\n to execute some actions, to move in some way.\n\n1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:39.200\n And then it infers based on those motor predictions\n\n1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:45.160\n and what we call viscera motor predictions,\n\n1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:48.760\n meaning the changes in the viscera\n\n1:14:48.760 --> 1:14:52.280\n that your brain is preparing to execute,\n\n1:14:54.200 --> 1:14:59.200\n your brain makes an inference about what you will sense\n\n1:14:59.640 --> 1:15:01.600\n based on those motor movements.\n\n1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:05.440\n So your experience of the world\n\n1:15:05.440 --> 1:15:08.200\n and your experience of your own body\n\n1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:13.800\n are a consequence of those predictions, those concepts.\n\n1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:16.800\n When your brain makes a concept for emotion,\n\n1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:21.680\n it's constructing an instance of that emotion.\n\n1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:24.240\n And that is how emotions are made.\n\n1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:27.440\n And those concepts load in,\n\n1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:32.440\n the predictions that are made include contents\n\n1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:36.560\n inside the body, contents outside the body.\n\n1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:38.400\n I mean, it includes other humans.\n\n1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:42.120\n So just this construction of a concept\n\n1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:46.160\n includes the variables that are much richer\n\n1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:51.160\n than just some sort of simple notion.\n\n1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:53.440\n Yeah, so our colloquial notion of a concept\n\n1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:58.440\n where I say, well, what's a concept of a bird?\n\n1:16:00.680 --> 1:16:02.800\n And then you list a set of features off to me.\n\n1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:04.760\n That's people's understanding,\n\n1:16:04.760 --> 1:16:05.920\n typically of what a concept is.\n\n1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:10.920\n But if you go into the literature in cognitive science,\n\n1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:13.080\n what you'll see is that the way\n\n1:16:13.080 --> 1:16:15.760\n that scientists have understood what a concept is\n\n1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:17.520\n has really changed over the years.\n\n1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:19.720\n So people used to think about a concept\n\n1:16:19.720 --> 1:16:24.320\n as philosophers and scientists used to think about a concept\n\n1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:27.400\n as a dictionary definition for a category.\n\n1:16:27.400 --> 1:16:29.600\n So there's a set of things which are similar\n\n1:16:29.600 --> 1:16:31.280\n out in the world.\n\n1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:36.280\n And your concept for that category\n\n1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:39.440\n is a dictionary definition of the features,\n\n1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:43.120\n the necessary insufficient features of those instances.\n\n1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:47.680\n So for a bird, it would be.\n\n1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:50.800\n Wings, feathers. Right, a beak.\n\n1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:53.360\n It flies, whatever, okay.\n\n1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:55.680\n That's called the classical category.\n\n1:16:55.680 --> 1:16:58.160\n And scientists discovered, observed\n\n1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:02.840\n that actually not all instances of birds have feathers\n\n1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:05.680\n and not all instances of birds fly.\n\n1:17:05.680 --> 1:17:08.400\n And so the idea was that you don't have\n\n1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:11.840\n a single representation of necessary insufficient features\n\n1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:13.000\n stored in your brain somewhere.\n\n1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.840\n Instead, what you have is a prototype,\n\n1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:18.400\n a prototype meaning you still have\n\n1:17:18.400 --> 1:17:20.960\n a single representation for the category, one,\n\n1:17:22.320 --> 1:17:27.240\n but the features are like of the most typical instance\n\n1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:29.600\n of the category or maybe the most frequent instance,\n\n1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:31.560\n but not all instances of the category\n\n1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:33.200\n have all the features, right?\n\n1:17:33.200 --> 1:17:36.600\n They have some graded similarity to the prototype.\n\n1:17:38.640 --> 1:17:42.880\n And then, you know,\n\n1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:47.880\n what I'm gonna like incredibly simplify now,\n\n1:17:48.440 --> 1:17:52.360\n a lot of work to say that then a series of experiments\n\n1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:55.200\n were done to show that in fact,\n\n1:17:56.040 --> 1:17:58.600\n what your brain seems to be doing is coming up\n\n1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:03.600\n with a single exemplar or instance of the category\n\n1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:08.760\n and reading off the features\n\n1:18:08.760 --> 1:18:11.000\n when I ask you for the concept.\n\n1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:16.000\n So if we were in a pet store and I asked you\n\n1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:20.000\n what are the features of a bird,\n\n1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:21.880\n tell me the concept of bird,\n\n1:18:21.880 --> 1:18:25.920\n you would be more likely to give me features of a good pet.\n\n1:18:26.840 --> 1:18:29.240\n And if we were in a restaurant,\n\n1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:31.840\n you would be more likely, you know, like a budgie, right?\n\n1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:32.960\n Or a canary.\n\n1:18:32.960 --> 1:18:34.080\n If we were in a restaurant,\n\n1:18:34.080 --> 1:18:36.560\n you would be more likely to give me the features\n\n1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:39.240\n of a bird that you would eat, like a chicken.\n\n1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:40.320\n And if we were in a park,\n\n1:18:40.320 --> 1:18:45.320\n you'd be more likely to give me in this country,\n\n1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:49.240\n you know, the features of a sparrow or a robin.\n\n1:18:49.240 --> 1:18:50.640\n Whereas if we were in South America,\n\n1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:54.560\n you would probably give me the features of a peacock\n\n1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:56.280\n because that's more common\n\n1:18:57.200 --> 1:18:59.240\n or it is more common there than here\n\n1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:01.520\n that you would see a peacock in such circumstances.\n\n1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:06.520\n So the idea was that really what your brain was doing\n\n1:19:06.520 --> 1:19:11.520\n was conjuring a concept on the fly\n\n1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:16.720\n that meets the function that the category is being put to.\n\n1:19:18.440 --> 1:19:19.280\n Okay?\n\n1:19:19.280 --> 1:19:20.120\n Okay.\n\n1:19:21.360 --> 1:19:26.360\n Then people started studying ad hoc concepts,\n\n1:19:27.280 --> 1:19:32.280\n meaning concepts where the instances don't share\n\n1:19:32.280 --> 1:19:37.280\n any physical features, but the function of the instances\n\n1:19:39.200 --> 1:19:40.320\n are the same.\n\n1:19:40.320 --> 1:19:42.360\n So for example, think about all the things\n\n1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:44.880\n that can protect you from the rain.\n\n1:19:46.200 --> 1:19:49.080\n What are all the things that can protect you from the rain?\n\n1:19:49.080 --> 1:19:54.080\n Umbrella, like this apartment.\n\n1:19:54.320 --> 1:19:55.160\n Right.\n\n1:19:56.720 --> 1:19:57.560\n Your car.\n\n1:19:57.560 --> 1:19:59.200\n Not giving a damn.\n\n1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:03.440\n Like a mindset.\n\n1:20:03.440 --> 1:20:05.360\n Yeah, right, right.\n\n1:20:05.360 --> 1:20:08.920\n So the idea is that the function of the instances\n\n1:20:08.920 --> 1:20:11.400\n is the same in a given situation.\n\n1:20:11.400 --> 1:20:13.800\n Even if they look different, sound different,\n\n1:20:13.800 --> 1:20:17.880\n smell different, this is called an abstract concept\n\n1:20:17.880 --> 1:20:21.560\n or a conceptual concept.\n\n1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:27.240\n Now the really cool thing about conceptual categories\n\n1:20:27.240 --> 1:20:31.800\n or conceptual category is a category of things\n\n1:20:31.800 --> 1:20:35.400\n that are held together by a function,\n\n1:20:35.400 --> 1:20:37.240\n which is called an abstract concept\n\n1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:39.000\n or a conceptual category,\n\n1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:41.600\n because the things don't share physical features,\n\n1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:44.000\n they share functional features.\n\n1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:46.160\n There are two really cool things about this.\n\n1:20:46.160 --> 1:20:50.280\n One is that's what Darwin said a species was.\n\n1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:55.280\n So Darwin is known for discovering natural selection.\n\n1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:02.280\n But the other thing he really did,\n\n1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:06.400\n which was really profound, which he's less celebrated for,\n\n1:21:06.400 --> 1:21:10.520\n is understanding that all biological categories\n\n1:21:10.520 --> 1:21:15.000\n have inherent variation, inherent variation.\n\n1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:19.160\n Darwin wrote in The Origin of Species\n\n1:21:19.160 --> 1:21:22.280\n about before Darwin's book,\n\n1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:27.280\n a species was thought to be a classical category\n\n1:21:27.440 --> 1:21:30.760\n where all the instances of dogs were the same,\n\n1:21:30.760 --> 1:21:32.200\n had the exactly same features,\n\n1:21:32.200 --> 1:21:37.200\n and any variation from that perfect platonic instance\n\n1:21:39.600 --> 1:21:41.400\n was considered to be error.\n\n1:21:41.400 --> 1:21:44.920\n And Darwin said, no, it's not error, it's meaningful.\n\n1:21:44.920 --> 1:21:49.920\n So nature selects on the basis of that variation.\n\n1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:56.040\n The reason why natural selection is powerful and can exist\n\n1:21:56.040 --> 1:21:59.880\n is because there is variation in a species.\n\n1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:03.960\n And in dogs, we talk about that variation\n\n1:22:03.960 --> 1:22:06.040\n in terms of the size of the dog\n\n1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:09.640\n and the amount of fur the dog has and the color\n\n1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:12.840\n and how long is the tail and how long is the snout.\n\n1:22:12.840 --> 1:22:16.200\n In humans, we talk about that variation\n\n1:22:16.200 --> 1:22:20.720\n in all kinds of ways, right, including in cultural ways.\n\n1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:25.680\n So that's one thing that's really interesting\n\n1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:28.200\n about conceptual categories is that Darwin\n\n1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:31.520\n is basically saying a species is a conceptual category.\n\n1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:34.640\n And in fact, if you look at modern debates\n\n1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:38.360\n about what is a species, you can't find anybody\n\n1:22:38.360 --> 1:22:43.040\n agreeing on what the criteria are for a species,\n\n1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:45.280\n because they don't all share the same genome.\n\n1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:47.720\n We don't all share, we don't,\n\n1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:49.800\n there isn't a single human genome.\n\n1:22:49.800 --> 1:22:54.800\n There's a population of genomes, but they're variable.\n\n1:22:56.200 --> 1:23:00.640\n It's not unbounded variation, but they are variable, right?\n\n1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:03.000\n And the other thing that's really cool\n\n1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:08.000\n about conceptual categories is that they are the categories\n\n1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:13.960\n that we use to make civilization.\n\n1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:18.000\n So think about money, for example.\n\n1:23:19.200 --> 1:23:21.760\n What are all the physical things\n\n1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:25.520\n that make something a currency?\n\n1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:28.680\n Is there any physical feature that all the currencies\n\n1:23:28.680 --> 1:23:33.540\n in all the worlds that's ever been used by humans share?\n\n1:23:33.540 --> 1:23:36.600\n Well, certainly, right, but what is it?\n\n1:23:36.600 --> 1:23:38.440\n Is it definable?\n\n1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:43.080\n So it's getting to the point that you make this function.\n\n1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:44.680\n It's the function, right.\n\n1:23:44.680 --> 1:23:47.200\n It's that we trade it for material goods.\n\n1:23:47.200 --> 1:23:49.000\n And we have to agree, right?\n\n1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:52.680\n We all impose on whatever it is, salt, barley,\n\n1:23:52.680 --> 1:23:55.480\n little shells, big rocks in the ocean that can't move,\n\n1:23:55.480 --> 1:23:58.240\n Bitcoin, pieces of plastic, mortgages,\n\n1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:00.720\n which are basically a promise of something in the future,\n\n1:24:00.720 --> 1:24:02.280\n nothing more, right?\n\n1:24:02.280 --> 1:24:06.240\n All of these things, we impose value on them.\n\n1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:09.680\n And we all agree that we can exchange them\n\n1:24:09.680 --> 1:24:11.200\n for material goods.\n\n1:24:11.200 --> 1:24:13.840\n Yeah, and yes, that's brilliant.\n\n1:24:13.840 --> 1:24:16.040\n By the way, you're attributing some of that to Darwin,\n\n1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:16.880\n that he thought.\n\n1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:18.440\n No, no, I'm saying that what Darwin.\n\n1:24:18.440 --> 1:24:19.480\n Because it's a brilliant view\n\n1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:21.720\n of what a species is, is the function.\n\n1:24:21.720 --> 1:24:24.480\n Yeah, what I'm saying is that what Darwin,\n\n1:24:24.480 --> 1:24:28.280\n Darwin really talked about variation in,\n\n1:24:28.280 --> 1:24:29.320\n so if you read, for example,\n\n1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:31.160\n the biologist Ernst Mayr,\n\n1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:33.280\n who was an evolutionary biologist,\n\n1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:34.440\n and then when he retired,\n\n1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:38.400\n became a historian and philosopher of biology.\n\n1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:42.960\n And his suggestion is that Darwin,\n\n1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:45.640\n Darwin did talk about variation.\n\n1:24:45.640 --> 1:24:48.080\n He vanquished what's called essentialism,\n\n1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:51.960\n the idea that there's a single set of features\n\n1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:54.840\n that define any species.\n\n1:24:56.080 --> 1:25:01.080\n And out of that grew really discussions\n\n1:25:02.840 --> 1:25:07.160\n of some of the functional features that species have,\n\n1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:10.680\n like they can reproduce, they can have offspring,\n\n1:25:10.680 --> 1:25:12.720\n the individuals of a species can have offspring.\n\n1:25:12.720 --> 1:25:16.720\n It turns out that's not a perfect criterion to use,\n\n1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:20.680\n but it's a functional criterion, right?\n\n1:25:20.680 --> 1:25:23.040\n So what I'm saying is that in cognitive science,\n\n1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:24.640\n people came up with the idea,\n\n1:25:24.640 --> 1:25:26.960\n they discovered the idea of conceptual categories\n\n1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:30.880\n or ad hoc concepts, these concepts that can change\n\n1:25:30.880 --> 1:25:33.440\n based on the function they're serving, right?\n\n1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:38.440\n And that it's there, it's in Darwin,\n\n1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:42.240\n and it's also in the philosophy of social reality.\n\n1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:44.880\n The way that philosophers talk about social reality,\n\n1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:46.200\n just look around you.\n\n1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:47.800\n I mean, we impose,\n\n1:25:47.800 --> 1:25:49.840\n we're treating a bunch of things as similar,\n\n1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:52.040\n which are physically different.\n\n1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:55.920\n And sometimes we take things that are physically the same\n\n1:25:55.920 --> 1:25:58.360\n and we treat them as separate categories.\n\n1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:02.280\n But it feels like the number of variables involved\n\n1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:04.840\n in that kind of categorization is nearly infinite.\n\n1:26:04.840 --> 1:26:06.160\n No, I don't think so,\n\n1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:08.560\n because there is a physical constraint, right?\n\n1:26:08.560 --> 1:26:13.560\n Like you and I could agree that we can fly in real life,\n\n1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:14.800\n but we can't.\n\n1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:18.840\n That's a physical constraint that we can't break, right?\n\n1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:21.520\n You and I could agree that we could walk through the walls,\n\n1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:22.400\n but we can't.\n\n1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:24.200\n We could agree that we could eat glass,\n\n1:26:24.200 --> 1:26:25.040\n but we can't.\n\n1:26:25.040 --> 1:26:25.880\n Oh, there's a lot of constraints, but I just.\n\n1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:28.720\n Yeah, we could agree that the virus doesn't exist\n\n1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:30.320\n and we don't have to wear masks.\n\n1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:33.040\n Right, yeah.\n\n1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:37.240\n But physical reality still holds the Trump card, right?\n\n1:26:37.240 --> 1:26:38.080\n But still there's a lot of.\n\n1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:41.560\n The Trump card, well, pun unintended.\n\n1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:43.160\n Pun completely unintended, but there you go,\n\n1:26:43.160 --> 1:26:44.960\n that's a predicting brain for you.\n\n1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:49.600\n But there is a tremendous amount of leeway.\n\n1:26:49.600 --> 1:26:50.440\n Yes.\n\n1:26:50.440 --> 1:26:51.600\n Yeah, that's the point.\n\n1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:54.520\n So what I'm saying is that emotions are like money.\n\n1:26:55.680 --> 1:26:59.000\n Basically, they're like money, they're like countries,\n\n1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:02.360\n they're like kings and queens and presidents.\n\n1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:05.200\n They're like everything that we construct\n\n1:27:05.200 --> 1:27:07.320\n that we impose meaning on.\n\n1:27:07.320 --> 1:27:10.480\n We take these physical signals and we give them meanings\n\n1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:13.840\n that they don't otherwise have by their physical nature.\n\n1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:18.840\n And because we agree, they have that function.\n\n1:27:19.360 --> 1:27:23.000\n But the beautiful thing, so maybe unlike money,\n\n1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:26.680\n I love this similarity is it's not obvious to me\n\n1:27:26.680 --> 1:27:29.440\n that this kind of emergent agreement\n\n1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:31.120\n should happen with emotion,\n\n1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:33.320\n because our experiences are so different\n\n1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:36.600\n for each of us humans, and yet we kind of converge.\n\n1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:39.760\n Well, in a culture we converge, but not across cultures.\n\n1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:41.680\n There are huge, huge differences.\n\n1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:44.960\n There are huge differences in what concepts exist,\n\n1:27:44.960 --> 1:27:48.480\n what they look like.\n\n1:27:48.480 --> 1:27:53.480\n So what I would say is that what we're doing\n\n1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:59.000\n with our young children as their brains become wired\n\n1:28:00.120 --> 1:28:03.840\n to their physical and their social environment\n\n1:28:03.840 --> 1:28:05.960\n is that we are curating for them.\n\n1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:07.920\n We are bootstrapping into their brains\n\n1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:11.600\n a set of emotion concepts.\n\n1:28:11.600 --> 1:28:13.000\n That's partly what they're learning.\n\n1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:15.080\n And we curate those for infants\n\n1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:17.240\n just the way we curate for them what is a dog,\n\n1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:19.640\n what is a cat, what is a truck.\n\n1:28:19.640 --> 1:28:22.360\n We sometimes explicitly label\n\n1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:25.160\n and we sometimes just use mental words.\n\n1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:30.640\n When your kid is throwing Cheerios on the floor\n\n1:28:30.640 --> 1:28:33.680\n instead of eating them, or your kid is crying\n\n1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:37.400\n when she won't put herself to sleep or whatever.\n\n1:28:37.400 --> 1:28:39.360\n We use mental words.\n\n1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:44.000\n And a word is this, words for infants,\n\n1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.560\n words are these really special things\n\n1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:49.320\n that they help infants learn abstract categories.\n\n1:28:49.320 --> 1:28:54.320\n There's a huge literature showing that children can take\n\n1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:56.400\n things that don't look infants,\n\n1:28:56.400 --> 1:28:58.840\n like infants, really young infants,\n\n1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:03.080\n preverbal infants can take, if you label,\n\n1:29:03.080 --> 1:29:07.000\n if I say to you, and you're an infant, okay?\n\n1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:12.000\n So I say, Lexi, this is a bling.\n\n1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:17.080\n And I put it down and the bling makes a squeaky noise.\n\n1:29:17.080 --> 1:29:22.080\n And then I say, Lexi, this is a bling.\n\n1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:24.760\n And I put it down and it makes a squeaky noise.\n\n1:29:24.760 --> 1:29:29.760\n And then I say, Lexi, this is a bling.\n\n1:29:30.720 --> 1:29:34.120\n You, as young as four months old,\n\n1:29:34.120 --> 1:29:39.120\n will expect this to make a noise, a squeaky noise.\n\n1:29:39.520 --> 1:29:41.920\n And if you don't, if it doesn't, you'll be surprised\n\n1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:44.680\n because it violated your expectation, right?\n\n1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:49.680\n I'm building for you an internal model of a bling.\n\n1:29:49.680 --> 1:29:53.200\n Okay, infants can do this really, really at a young age.\n\n1:29:53.200 --> 1:29:55.600\n And so there's no reason to believe\n\n1:29:55.600 --> 1:29:58.440\n that they couldn't learn emotion categories\n\n1:29:58.440 --> 1:29:59.680\n and concepts in the same way.\n\n1:29:59.680 --> 1:30:04.320\n And what happens when you go to a new culture?\n\n1:30:04.320 --> 1:30:05.720\n When you go to a new culture,\n\n1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:11.320\n you have to do what's called emotion acculturation.\n\n1:30:11.320 --> 1:30:13.680\n So my colleague Bacha Mesquita in Belgium\n\n1:30:13.680 --> 1:30:15.080\n studies emotion acculturation.\n\n1:30:15.080 --> 1:30:16.560\n She studies how, when people move\n\n1:30:16.560 --> 1:30:18.080\n from one culture to another,\n\n1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:21.720\n how do they learn the emotion concepts of that culture?\n\n1:30:21.720 --> 1:30:23.440\n How do they learn to make sense\n\n1:30:23.440 --> 1:30:25.920\n of their own internal sensations\n\n1:30:25.920 --> 1:30:29.640\n and also the movements, the raise of an eyebrow,\n\n1:30:29.640 --> 1:30:30.560\n the tilt of a head?\n\n1:30:30.560 --> 1:30:34.640\n How do they learn to make sense of cues from other people\n\n1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:37.760\n using concepts they don't have,\n\n1:30:37.760 --> 1:30:40.600\n but have to make on the fly?\n\n1:30:40.600 --> 1:30:43.240\n So that's the difference between cultures.\n\n1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:45.200\n Let me open another door.\n\n1:30:45.200 --> 1:30:46.400\n I'm not sure I wanna open,\n\n1:30:46.400 --> 1:30:49.320\n but the difference between men and women.\n\n1:30:49.320 --> 1:30:53.840\n Is there a difference between the emotional lives\n\n1:30:53.840 --> 1:30:57.180\n of those two categories of biological systems?\n\n1:30:57.180 --> 1:31:00.300\n So here's what I would say.\n\n1:31:00.300 --> 1:31:04.740\n We did a series of studies in the 1990s\n\n1:31:04.740 --> 1:31:07.300\n where we asked men and women\n\n1:31:07.300 --> 1:31:10.020\n to tell us about their emotional lives.\n\n1:31:10.020 --> 1:31:11.340\n And women described themselves\n\n1:31:11.340 --> 1:31:13.620\n as much more emotional than men.\n\n1:31:13.620 --> 1:31:15.460\n They believed that they were more emotional than men\n\n1:31:15.460 --> 1:31:17.140\n and men agreed.\n\n1:31:17.140 --> 1:31:19.580\n Women are much more emotional than men.\n\n1:31:19.580 --> 1:31:24.260\n And then we gave them little handheld computers.\n\n1:31:24.260 --> 1:31:26.340\n These were little Hewlett Packard computers.\n\n1:31:26.340 --> 1:31:28.860\n They fit in the palm of your hand.\n\n1:31:28.860 --> 1:31:29.700\n They weighed a couple of pounds.\n\n1:31:29.700 --> 1:31:31.680\n So this was like pre palm pilot even,\n\n1:31:31.680 --> 1:31:36.680\n like this was 1990s and like early.\n\n1:31:36.740 --> 1:31:41.540\n And we asked them,\n\n1:31:41.540 --> 1:31:45.780\n we would ping them like 10 times a day\n\n1:31:45.780 --> 1:31:48.900\n and just ask them to report how they were feeling,\n\n1:31:48.900 --> 1:31:50.820\n which is called experience sampling.\n\n1:31:51.920 --> 1:31:53.940\n So we experienced sampled.\n\n1:31:53.940 --> 1:31:57.760\n And then at the end,\n\n1:31:57.760 --> 1:31:59.420\n and then we looked at their reports\n\n1:31:59.420 --> 1:32:01.060\n and what we found is that men and women\n\n1:32:01.060 --> 1:32:02.500\n basically didn't differ.\n\n1:32:02.500 --> 1:32:05.540\n And there were some people who were really,\n\n1:32:05.540 --> 1:32:07.780\n had many more instances of emotion.\n\n1:32:07.780 --> 1:32:12.780\n So they were treading water in a tumultuous sea of emotion.\n\n1:32:15.980 --> 1:32:17.360\n And then there were other people\n\n1:32:17.360 --> 1:32:21.060\n who were like floating tranquilly in a lake.\n\n1:32:21.060 --> 1:32:23.060\n It was really not perturbed very often.\n\n1:32:23.060 --> 1:32:25.160\n And everyone in between,\n\n1:32:25.160 --> 1:32:28.260\n but there were no difference between men and women.\n\n1:32:28.260 --> 1:32:30.220\n And the really interesting thing is at the end\n\n1:32:30.220 --> 1:32:32.720\n of the sampling period, we asked people,\n\n1:32:33.580 --> 1:32:36.800\n so reflect over the past two weeks and tell it.\n\n1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:39.700\n So we've been now pinging people like again\n\n1:32:39.700 --> 1:32:41.140\n and again and again, right?\n\n1:32:41.140 --> 1:32:44.120\n So tell us how emotional do you think you are?\n\n1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:45.440\n No change from the beginning.\n\n1:32:45.440 --> 1:32:50.440\n So men and women believe that they are different.\n\n1:32:50.440 --> 1:32:53.360\n And when they are looking at other people,\n\n1:32:53.360 --> 1:32:56.880\n they make different inferences about emotion.\n\n1:32:56.880 --> 1:32:59.400\n If a man is scowling,\n\n1:32:59.400 --> 1:33:01.080\n like if you and I were together\n\n1:33:01.080 --> 1:33:04.520\n and so somebody is watching this, okay?\n\n1:33:04.520 --> 1:33:07.360\n And yeah, hey, who are you saying?\n\n1:33:07.360 --> 1:33:08.200\n Hey, hi.\n\n1:33:08.200 --> 1:33:09.040\n Yeah, hi.\n\n1:33:09.840 --> 1:33:12.440\n By the way, people love it when you look at the camera.\n\n1:33:15.480 --> 1:33:20.320\n If you and I make exactly the same set of facial movements,\n\n1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:25.320\n when people look at you, both men and women look at you,\n\n1:33:25.920 --> 1:33:27.760\n they are more likely to think,\n\n1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:30.720\n oh, he's reacting to the situation.\n\n1:33:30.720 --> 1:33:33.320\n And when they look at me, they'll say,\n\n1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:34.680\n oh, she's having an emotion.\n\n1:33:34.680 --> 1:33:36.380\n She's, you know, yeah.\n\n1:33:36.380 --> 1:33:38.000\n And I wrote about this actually\n\n1:33:40.380 --> 1:33:45.380\n right before the 2016 election.\n\n1:33:46.620 --> 1:33:49.220\n You know what, maybe I could confess.\n\n1:33:49.220 --> 1:33:51.680\n Let me try to carefully confess.\n\n1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:53.040\n But you are really gonna.\n\n1:33:53.040 --> 1:33:57.560\n Yeah, that when I,\n\n1:33:57.560 --> 1:34:01.240\n that there is an element when I see Hillary Clinton\n\n1:34:02.440 --> 1:34:06.880\n that there was something annoying about her to me.\n\n1:34:06.880 --> 1:34:09.400\n And I, just that feeling,\n\n1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:13.960\n and then I tried to reduce that to what is that?\n\n1:34:13.960 --> 1:34:17.320\n Because I think the same attributes\n\n1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:19.560\n that are annoying about her\n\n1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:22.040\n when I see in other people wouldn't be annoying.\n\n1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:25.000\n So I was trying to understand what is it?\n\n1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:28.000\n Because it certainly does feel like that concept\n\n1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:30.080\n that I've constructed in my mind.\n\n1:34:30.080 --> 1:34:32.160\n Well, I'll tell you that I think,\n\n1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:35.920\n well, let me just say that what you would predict about,\n\n1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:39.040\n for example, the performance of the two of them\n\n1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:42.000\n in the debates, and I wrote an op ed\n\n1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:46.320\n for the New York Times actually before the second debate.\n\n1:34:46.320 --> 1:34:48.640\n And it played out really pretty much\n\n1:34:48.640 --> 1:34:51.200\n as I thought that it would based on research.\n\n1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:53.220\n It's not like I'm like a great fortune teller or anything.\n\n1:34:53.220 --> 1:34:54.560\n It's just, I was just applying the research,\n\n1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:57.240\n which was that when a woman,\n\n1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:03.200\n a woman's, people make internal attributions, it's called.\n\n1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:07.160\n They infer that the facial movements and body posture\n\n1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:10.580\n and vocalizations of a woman reflect her interstate.\n\n1:35:10.580 --> 1:35:12.880\n But for a man, they're more likely to assume\n\n1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:15.260\n that they reflect his response to the situation.\n\n1:35:15.260 --> 1:35:16.440\n It doesn't say anything about him.\n\n1:35:16.440 --> 1:35:19.120\n It says something about the situation he's in.\n\n1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:22.920\n Now, for the thing that you were describing\n\n1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:27.840\n about Hillary Clinton, I think a lot of people experienced,\n\n1:35:27.840 --> 1:35:30.640\n but it's also in line with research, which shows,\n\n1:35:30.640 --> 1:35:32.560\n and particularly research actually\n\n1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:36.160\n about teaching evaluations is one place\n\n1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:39.600\n that you really see it, where the expectation\n\n1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:42.080\n is that a woman will be nurturant\n\n1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:46.160\n and that a man, there's just no expectation\n\n1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:47.280\n for him to be nurturant.\n\n1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:50.760\n So if he is nurturant, he gets points.\n\n1:35:51.960 --> 1:35:54.200\n If he's not, he gets points.\n\n1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:56.000\n They're just different points, right?\n\n1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.440\n Whereas for a woman, especially a woman\n\n1:35:58.440 --> 1:36:02.440\n who's an authority figure, she's really in a catch 22.\n\n1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:05.400\n Because if she's serious, she's a bitch.\n\n1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:09.480\n And if she's empathic, then she's weak.\n\n1:36:09.480 --> 1:36:12.920\n Right, that's brilliant. I mean, one of the bigger questions\n\n1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:15.320\n to ask here, so that's one example\n\n1:36:15.320 --> 1:36:20.320\n where our construction of concepts gets in trouble.\n\n1:36:20.640 --> 1:36:24.240\n So, but remember I said science and philosophy\n\n1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:26.000\n are like tools for living.\n\n1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:30.440\n So I learned recently that if you ask me\n\n1:36:30.440 --> 1:36:34.240\n what is my intuition about what regulates my eating,\n\n1:36:34.240 --> 1:36:36.340\n I will say carbohydrates.\n\n1:36:36.340 --> 1:36:37.480\n I love carbohydrates.\n\n1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:38.480\n I love pasta.\n\n1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:39.320\n I love bread.\n\n1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:42.200\n I love, I just love carbohydrates.\n\n1:36:42.200 --> 1:36:45.960\n But actually research shows, and it's beautiful research.\n\n1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:49.160\n I love this research because it so violates my own\n\n1:36:49.160 --> 1:36:52.720\n like deeply, deeply held beliefs about myself\n\n1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:57.480\n that most animals on this planet who have been studied\n\n1:36:57.480 --> 1:37:00.640\n and there are many actually eat\n\n1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:02.500\n to regulate their protein intake.\n\n1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:06.440\n So you will overeat carbohydrates\n\n1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:10.000\n if you, in order to get enough protein.\n\n1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.320\n And this research has been done with human,\n\n1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:15.780\n very beautiful research with humans, with crickets,\n\n1:37:15.780 --> 1:37:17.280\n with like, you know, bonobos.\n\n1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:19.200\n I mean, just like all these different animals, not bonobos,\n\n1:37:19.200 --> 1:37:20.500\n but I think like baboons.\n\n1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:24.580\n Now that I have no intuition about that.\n\n1:37:24.580 --> 1:37:27.800\n And I, even now as I regulate my eating,\n\n1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:30.500\n I still, I just have no intuition.\n\n1:37:30.500 --> 1:37:32.800\n It just, I can't feel it.\n\n1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:35.800\n What I feel is only about the carbohydrates.\n\n1:37:35.800 --> 1:37:38.040\n It feels like you're regulating around carbohydrates,\n\n1:37:38.040 --> 1:37:38.880\n not the protein.\n\n1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:41.100\n Yeah, but in fact, actually what I am doing,\n\n1:37:41.100 --> 1:37:43.920\n if I am like most animals on the planet,\n\n1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:45.240\n I am regulating around protein.\n\n1:37:45.240 --> 1:37:48.440\n So knowing this, what do I do?\n\n1:37:48.440 --> 1:37:51.580\n I correct my behavior to eat,\n\n1:37:51.580 --> 1:37:56.260\n to actually deliberately try to focus on the protein.\n\n1:37:56.260 --> 1:38:00.140\n This is the idea behind bias training, right?\n\n1:38:00.140 --> 1:38:01.820\n Like if you,\n\n1:38:01.820 --> 1:38:06.820\n I also did not experience Hillary Clinton\n\n1:38:09.700 --> 1:38:12.820\n as the warmest candidate.\n\n1:38:12.820 --> 1:38:17.820\n However, you can use consistent science,\n\n1:38:19.780 --> 1:38:21.340\n since the consistent scientific findings\n\n1:38:21.340 --> 1:38:24.380\n to organize your behavior.\n\n1:38:24.380 --> 1:38:26.460\n That doesn't mean that rationality\n\n1:38:26.460 --> 1:38:28.420\n is the absence of emotion,\n\n1:38:28.420 --> 1:38:33.180\n because sometimes emotion or any feelings in general,\n\n1:38:33.180 --> 1:38:37.300\n not the same thing as emotion, that's another topic,\n\n1:38:37.300 --> 1:38:41.540\n but are a source of information\n\n1:38:41.540 --> 1:38:42.820\n and their wisdom and helpful.\n\n1:38:42.820 --> 1:38:44.380\n So I'm not saying that,\n\n1:38:44.380 --> 1:38:45.380\n but what I am saying is that\n\n1:38:45.380 --> 1:38:46.820\n if you have a deeply held belief\n\n1:38:46.820 --> 1:38:50.340\n and the evidence shows that you're wrong, then you're wrong.\n\n1:38:50.340 --> 1:38:52.780\n It doesn't really matter how confident you feel.\n\n1:38:53.660 --> 1:38:56.160\n That confidence could be also explained by science, right?\n\n1:38:56.160 --> 1:38:59.640\n So it would be the same thing as if I,\n\n1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:02.340\n regardless of whether someone is like Charlie Baker,\n\n1:39:02.340 --> 1:39:04.380\n regardless of whether somebody is a Republican\n\n1:39:04.380 --> 1:39:05.220\n or a Democrat,\n\n1:39:05.220 --> 1:39:09.300\n if that person has a record that you can see\n\n1:39:09.300 --> 1:39:11.900\n is consistent with what you believe,\n\n1:39:11.900 --> 1:39:14.720\n then that is information that you can act on.\n\n1:39:15.700 --> 1:39:17.980\n Yeah, and then try to,\n\n1:39:17.980 --> 1:39:21.100\n I mean, this is kind of what empathy is in open mindedness,\n\n1:39:21.100 --> 1:39:25.280\n is try to consider that the set of concepts\n\n1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:27.420\n that your brain has constructed\n\n1:39:27.420 --> 1:39:30.220\n through which you are now perceiving the world\n\n1:39:30.220 --> 1:39:32.240\n is not painting the full picture.\n\n1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:35.140\n I mean, this is now true for basically every,\n\n1:39:35.140 --> 1:39:36.500\n it doesn't have to be men and women,\n\n1:39:36.500 --> 1:39:39.580\n it could be basically the prism through which we perceive\n\n1:39:39.580 --> 1:39:41.660\n actually the political discourse, right?\n\n1:39:41.660 --> 1:39:44.460\n Absolutely, so here's what I would say.\n\n1:39:49.040 --> 1:39:52.180\n There are people who, scientists who will talk to you\n\n1:39:52.180 --> 1:39:54.740\n about cognitive empathy and emotional empathy\n\n1:39:54.740 --> 1:39:59.540\n and I prefer to think of it,\n\n1:39:59.540 --> 1:40:01.980\n I think the evidence is more consistent\n\n1:40:01.980 --> 1:40:03.160\n with what I'm about to say,\n\n1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:08.160\n which is that your brain is always making predictions\n\n1:40:08.180 --> 1:40:11.420\n using your own past experience and what you've learned\n\n1:40:11.420 --> 1:40:14.900\n from books and movies and other people telling you\n\n1:40:14.900 --> 1:40:16.580\n about their experiences and so on.\n\n1:40:17.700 --> 1:40:22.700\n And if your brain cannot make a concept\n\n1:40:22.700 --> 1:40:25.840\n to make sense of those, anticipate what those sense data are\n\n1:40:25.840 --> 1:40:29.880\n and make sense of them, you will be experientially blind.\n\n1:40:31.080 --> 1:40:34.160\n So, when I'm giving lectures to people,\n\n1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:37.920\n I'll show them like a blobby black and white image\n\n1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:42.240\n and they're experientially blind to the image,\n\n1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:44.200\n they can't see anything in it.\n\n1:40:44.200 --> 1:40:45.860\n And then I show them a photograph\n\n1:40:45.860 --> 1:40:48.700\n and then I show them the image again, the blobby image\n\n1:40:48.700 --> 1:40:51.040\n and then they see actually an object in it.\n\n1:40:51.040 --> 1:40:53.840\n But the image is the same.\n\n1:40:53.840 --> 1:40:55.720\n It's they're actually adding,\n\n1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:57.760\n their predictions now are adding, right?\n\n1:40:57.760 --> 1:41:02.500\n Or anybody who's learned a language,\n\n1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:07.400\n a second language after their first language\n\n1:41:07.400 --> 1:41:10.800\n also has this experience of things\n\n1:41:10.800 --> 1:41:12.320\n that initially sound like sounds\n\n1:41:12.320 --> 1:41:14.100\n that they can't quite make sense of,\n\n1:41:14.100 --> 1:41:18.160\n eventually come to make sense of them.\n\n1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:20.600\n And in fact, there are really cool examples\n\n1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:23.280\n of people who were like born blind\n\n1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:28.200\n because they have cataracts or they have corneal damage\n\n1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:33.200\n so that no light is reaching the brain.\n\n1:41:33.800 --> 1:41:35.960\n And then they have an operation\n\n1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:39.580\n and then light reaches the brain and they can't see.\n\n1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:45.120\n For days and weeks and sometimes years,\n\n1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:47.600\n they are experientially blind to certain things.\n\n1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:51.040\n So what happens with empathy, right?\n\n1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:54.820\n Is that your brain is making a prediction.\n\n1:41:54.820 --> 1:41:59.820\n And if it doesn't have the capacity to make,\n\n1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:06.620\n if you don't share, if you're not similar,\n\n1:42:06.620 --> 1:42:10.520\n remember categories are instances\n\n1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:12.020\n which are similar in some way.\n\n1:42:12.020 --> 1:42:16.040\n If you are not similar enough to that person,\n\n1:42:16.040 --> 1:42:17.800\n you will have a hard time making a prediction\n\n1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:19.440\n about what they feel.\n\n1:42:19.440 --> 1:42:22.600\n You will be experientially blind to what they feel.\n\n1:42:24.920 --> 1:42:29.420\n In the United States, children of color\n\n1:42:29.420 --> 1:42:33.620\n are under prescribed medicine by their physicians.\n\n1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:37.520\n This is been documented.\n\n1:42:38.760 --> 1:42:43.760\n It's not that the physicians are racist necessarily\n\n1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:48.020\n but they might be experientially blind.\n\n1:42:52.140 --> 1:42:54.500\n The same thing is true of male physicians\n\n1:42:54.500 --> 1:42:56.780\n with female patients.\n\n1:42:56.780 --> 1:43:00.220\n I could tell you some hair raising stories really\n\n1:43:00.220 --> 1:43:03.020\n that where people die as a consequence\n\n1:43:03.020 --> 1:43:07.100\n of a physician making the wrong inference,\n\n1:43:07.100 --> 1:43:11.120\n the wrong prediction because of being experientially blind.\n\n1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:16.120\n So we are, empathy is not, it's not magic.\n\n1:43:21.220 --> 1:43:23.620\n We make inferences about each other,\n\n1:43:23.620 --> 1:43:26.180\n about what each other's feeling and thinking.\n\n1:43:26.180 --> 1:43:28.260\n In this culture more than,\n\n1:43:28.260 --> 1:43:30.620\n there are some cultures where people\n\n1:43:31.740 --> 1:43:33.500\n have what's called opacity of mind\n\n1:43:33.500 --> 1:43:34.820\n where they will make a prediction\n\n1:43:34.820 --> 1:43:35.860\n about someone else's actions\n\n1:43:35.860 --> 1:43:37.140\n but they're not inferring anything\n\n1:43:37.140 --> 1:43:39.940\n about the internal state of that person.\n\n1:43:39.940 --> 1:43:43.460\n But in our culture, we're constantly making inferences.\n\n1:43:43.460 --> 1:43:44.980\n What is this person thinking?\n\n1:43:44.980 --> 1:43:47.300\n And we're not doing it necessarily consciously\n\n1:43:47.300 --> 1:43:48.780\n but we're just doing it really automatically\n\n1:43:48.780 --> 1:43:51.660\n using our predictions, what we know.\n\n1:43:51.660 --> 1:43:56.660\n And if you expose yourself to information\n\n1:43:57.620 --> 1:43:59.980\n which is very different from somebody else,\n\n1:43:59.980 --> 1:44:03.740\n I mean, really what we have is we have different cultures\n\n1:44:03.740 --> 1:44:07.140\n in this country right now that are,\n\n1:44:07.140 --> 1:44:08.920\n there are a number of reasons for this.\n\n1:44:08.920 --> 1:44:10.620\n I mean, part of it is, I don't know if you saw\n\n1:44:10.620 --> 1:44:13.580\n the Social Dilemma, the Netflix.\n\n1:44:14.740 --> 1:44:15.580\n Heard about it.\n\n1:44:15.580 --> 1:44:20.580\n Yeah, it's a great, it's really great documentary and...\n\n1:44:20.900 --> 1:44:23.260\n About what social networks are doing to our society?\n\n1:44:23.260 --> 1:44:24.740\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:44:24.740 --> 1:44:29.740\n But nothing, no phenomenon has a simple single cause.\n\n1:44:31.700 --> 1:44:35.020\n There are multiple small causes\n\n1:44:35.020 --> 1:44:37.100\n which all add up to a perfect storm.\n\n1:44:37.100 --> 1:44:41.900\n That's just how most things work.\n\n1:44:41.900 --> 1:44:45.140\n And so the fact that machine learning algorithms\n\n1:44:45.140 --> 1:44:48.860\n are serving people up information on social media\n\n1:44:48.860 --> 1:44:51.380\n that is consistent with what they've already viewed\n\n1:44:51.380 --> 1:44:56.380\n and making, is part of the reason that you have these silos\n\n1:44:57.600 --> 1:45:00.860\n but it's not the only reason why you have these silos.\n\n1:45:00.860 --> 1:45:04.540\n I think there are other things afoot\n\n1:45:04.540 --> 1:45:09.500\n that enhance people's inability\n\n1:45:09.500 --> 1:45:13.340\n to even have a decent conversation.\n\n1:45:13.340 --> 1:45:15.700\n Yeah, I mean, okay, so many things you said\n\n1:45:15.700 --> 1:45:20.000\n are just brilliant, so the experiential blindness\n\n1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:24.140\n but also from my perspective, like I preach\n\n1:45:24.140 --> 1:45:27.180\n and I try to practice empathy a lot\n\n1:45:27.180 --> 1:45:30.780\n and something about the way you've explained it\n\n1:45:30.780 --> 1:45:33.620\n makes me almost see it as a kind of exercise\n\n1:45:33.620 --> 1:45:35.820\n that we should all do, like to train,\n\n1:45:35.820 --> 1:45:38.740\n like to add experiences to the brain\n\n1:45:38.740 --> 1:45:42.660\n to expand this capacity to predict more effectively.\n\n1:45:42.660 --> 1:45:43.620\n Absolutely.\n\n1:45:43.620 --> 1:45:47.660\n So like what I do is kind of like a method acting thing\n\n1:45:47.660 --> 1:45:51.260\n which is I imagine what the life of a person is like.\n\n1:45:52.900 --> 1:45:54.900\n Just think, I mean, this is something you see\n\n1:45:54.900 --> 1:45:58.220\n with Black Lives Matter and police officers.\n\n1:45:58.220 --> 1:46:01.900\n It feels like they're both, not both,\n\n1:46:01.900 --> 1:46:03.940\n but I have, because martial arts and so on,\n\n1:46:03.940 --> 1:46:06.580\n I have a lot of friends who are cops.\n\n1:46:06.580 --> 1:46:09.220\n They don't necessarily\n\n1:46:11.780 --> 1:46:14.940\n have empathy or visualize the experience of the other.\n\n1:46:14.940 --> 1:46:17.000\n Certainly, currently, unfortunately,\n\n1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:19.380\n people aren't doing that with police officers.\n\n1:46:19.380 --> 1:46:22.980\n They're not imagining, they're not empathizing\n\n1:46:22.980 --> 1:46:26.300\n or putting themselves in the shoes of a police officer\n\n1:46:26.300 --> 1:46:28.620\n to realize how difficult that job is,\n\n1:46:28.620 --> 1:46:32.340\n how dangerous it is, how difficult it is to maintain calm\n\n1:46:32.340 --> 1:46:35.140\n and under so much uncertainty, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:46:35.140 --> 1:46:37.720\n But there's more, there's even, that's all that's true,\n\n1:46:37.720 --> 1:46:39.500\n but I think that there's even more,\n\n1:46:39.500 --> 1:46:41.300\n there's even more to be said there.\n\n1:46:41.300 --> 1:46:44.400\n I mean, like from a predicting brain standpoint,\n\n1:46:44.400 --> 1:46:47.100\n there's even more that can be said there.\n\n1:46:47.100 --> 1:46:48.680\n So I don't know if you wanna go down that path\n\n1:46:48.680 --> 1:46:49.920\n or you wanna stick on empathy,\n\n1:46:49.920 --> 1:46:52.980\n but I will also say that one of the things\n\n1:46:52.980 --> 1:46:57.020\n that I was most gratified by, I still am receiving,\n\n1:46:57.020 --> 1:46:59.660\n it's been more than three and a half years\n\n1:46:59.660 --> 1:47:00.940\n since How Motions Are Made came out\n\n1:47:00.940 --> 1:47:04.380\n and I'm still receiving daily emails from people, right?\n\n1:47:04.380 --> 1:47:05.780\n So that's gratifying.\n\n1:47:05.780 --> 1:47:09.700\n But one of the most gratifying emails I received\n\n1:47:09.700 --> 1:47:12.780\n was from a police officer in Texas\n\n1:47:12.780 --> 1:47:17.060\n who told me that he thought that How Motions Are Made\n\n1:47:19.180 --> 1:47:24.180\n contained information that would be really helpful\n\n1:47:24.180 --> 1:47:28.820\n to resolving some of these difficulties.\n\n1:47:28.820 --> 1:47:33.100\n And he hadn't even read my op ed piece\n\n1:47:33.100 --> 1:47:35.060\n about when is a gun not a gun?\n\n1:47:35.060 --> 1:47:39.260\n And like using what we know about the science of perception\n\n1:47:39.260 --> 1:47:41.740\n from a prediction standpoint,\n\n1:47:41.740 --> 1:47:43.660\n like the brain is a predictor,\n\n1:47:43.660 --> 1:47:45.820\n to understand a little differently\n\n1:47:45.820 --> 1:47:49.180\n what might be happening in these circumstances.\n\n1:47:49.180 --> 1:47:52.340\n So there's a real, what's hard about,\n\n1:47:52.340 --> 1:47:57.340\n it's hard to talk about because everyone gets mad at you\n\n1:47:57.580 --> 1:47:59.460\n when you talk about this, like, you know.\n\n1:47:59.460 --> 1:48:02.620\n And there is a way to understand this\n\n1:48:02.620 --> 1:48:05.020\n which has profound empathy\n\n1:48:05.020 --> 1:48:10.020\n for the suffering of people of color\n\n1:48:10.020 --> 1:48:15.020\n and that definitely is in line with Black Lives Matter\n\n1:48:15.780 --> 1:48:18.100\n at the same time as understanding\n\n1:48:18.100 --> 1:48:21.060\n the really difficult situation\n\n1:48:21.060 --> 1:48:23.460\n that police officers find themselves in.\n\n1:48:23.460 --> 1:48:26.500\n And I'm not talking about this bad apple or that bad apple.\n\n1:48:26.500 --> 1:48:28.020\n I'm not talking about police officers\n\n1:48:28.020 --> 1:48:30.220\n who are necessarily shooting people in the back\n\n1:48:30.220 --> 1:48:31.260\n as they run away.\n\n1:48:31.260 --> 1:48:34.420\n I'm talking about the cases of really good,\n\n1:48:34.420 --> 1:48:39.420\n well meaning cops who have the kind of predicting brain\n\n1:48:39.460 --> 1:48:41.340\n that everybody else has.\n\n1:48:42.540 --> 1:48:45.980\n They're in a really difficult situation\n\n1:48:45.980 --> 1:48:50.420\n that I think both they and the people\n\n1:48:50.420 --> 1:48:55.260\n who are harmed don't realize,\n\n1:48:55.260 --> 1:48:58.300\n like the way that these situations are constructed,\n\n1:48:58.300 --> 1:49:01.420\n I think it's just, there's a lot to be said there I guess\n\n1:49:01.420 --> 1:49:02.260\n is what I want to say.\n\n1:49:02.260 --> 1:49:06.060\n Yeah, is there something we can try to say in a sense,\n\n1:49:06.060 --> 1:49:09.660\n like what I'm, from the perspective of the predictive brain\n\n1:49:09.660 --> 1:49:14.660\n which is a fascinating perspective to take on this,\n\n1:49:15.100 --> 1:49:18.100\n you know, all the protests that are going on,\n\n1:49:18.100 --> 1:49:22.540\n there seems to be a concept of a police officer being built.\n\n1:49:22.540 --> 1:49:25.620\n No, I think that concept is there.\n\n1:49:25.620 --> 1:49:30.620\n But it's gaining strength, so it's being re, I mean.\n\n1:49:30.940 --> 1:49:31.780\n Yeah, it is.\n\n1:49:31.780 --> 1:49:32.940\n Sure, it is there.\n\n1:49:32.940 --> 1:49:35.380\n But I think, yeah, for sure, I think that that's right.\n\n1:49:35.380 --> 1:49:40.380\n I think that there's a shift in the stereotype\n\n1:49:42.580 --> 1:49:44.380\n of what I would say is a stereotype.\n\n1:49:44.380 --> 1:49:48.260\n There's a stereotype of a black man in this country\n\n1:49:48.260 --> 1:49:50.740\n that's always in movies and television,\n\n1:49:50.740 --> 1:49:55.740\n not always, but like largely, that many people watch.\n\n1:49:56.660 --> 1:50:00.220\n I mean, you think you're watching a 10 o clock drama\n\n1:50:00.220 --> 1:50:02.660\n and all you're doing is like kicking back and relaxing,\n\n1:50:02.660 --> 1:50:07.020\n but actually you're having certain predictions reinforced\n\n1:50:07.020 --> 1:50:07.940\n and others not.\n\n1:50:07.940 --> 1:50:12.740\n And what's happening now with police is the same thing,\n\n1:50:12.740 --> 1:50:16.860\n that there are certain stereotypes of a police officer\n\n1:50:16.860 --> 1:50:19.540\n that are being abandoned and other stereotypes\n\n1:50:19.540 --> 1:50:23.900\n that are being reinforced by what you see happening.\n\n1:50:23.900 --> 1:50:26.420\n All I'll say is that if you remember,\n\n1:50:26.420 --> 1:50:28.500\n I mean, there's a lot to say about this, really,\n\n1:50:28.500 --> 1:50:33.180\n that regardless of whether it makes people mad or not,\n\n1:50:33.180 --> 1:50:35.940\n I mean, I just, the science is what it is.\n\n1:50:37.700 --> 1:50:39.140\n Just remember what I said.\n\n1:50:39.140 --> 1:50:44.140\n The brain makes predictions about internal changes\n\n1:50:45.500 --> 1:50:49.140\n in the body first and then it starts to prepare motor action\n\n1:50:49.140 --> 1:50:52.980\n and then it makes a prediction about what you will see\n\n1:50:52.980 --> 1:50:57.220\n and hear and feel based on those actions, okay?\n\n1:50:57.220 --> 1:51:01.740\n So it's also the case that we didn't talk about\n\n1:51:01.740 --> 1:51:04.260\n is that sensory sampling,\n\n1:51:04.260 --> 1:51:07.100\n like your brain's ability to sample what's out there\n\n1:51:07.100 --> 1:51:12.100\n is yoked to your heart rate, it's yoked to your heartbeats.\n\n1:51:12.900 --> 1:51:15.260\n There are certain phases of the heartbeat\n\n1:51:15.260 --> 1:51:17.620\n where it's easier for you to see what's happening\n\n1:51:17.620 --> 1:51:20.140\n in the world than in others.\n\n1:51:20.140 --> 1:51:23.420\n And so if your heart rate goes through the roof,\n\n1:51:26.260 --> 1:51:28.540\n you will be less likely, you will be more likely\n\n1:51:28.540 --> 1:51:32.180\n to just go with your prediction and not correct\n\n1:51:32.180 --> 1:51:34.740\n based on what's out there\n\n1:51:34.740 --> 1:51:37.860\n because you're actually literally not seeing as well.\n\n1:51:39.180 --> 1:51:41.980\n Or you will see things that aren't there, basically.\n\n1:51:43.700 --> 1:51:48.380\n Is there something that we could say by way of advice\n\n1:51:48.380 --> 1:51:52.500\n for when this episode is released\n\n1:51:52.500 --> 1:51:57.100\n in the chaos of emotion?\n\n1:51:57.100 --> 1:51:58.900\n Sorry, I don't know about a term\n\n1:51:58.900 --> 1:52:01.340\n that's just flying around on social media.\n\n1:52:01.340 --> 1:52:02.780\n What's?\n\n1:52:02.780 --> 1:52:06.300\n Well, I actually think it is emotion in the following sense.\n\n1:52:07.460 --> 1:52:10.260\n And it sounds a little bit like,\n\n1:52:10.260 --> 1:52:14.420\n it sounds a little bit like artificial\n\n1:52:14.420 --> 1:52:16.060\n in the way that I'm about to say it,\n\n1:52:16.060 --> 1:52:18.940\n but I really think that this is what's happening.\n\n1:52:18.940 --> 1:52:23.940\n One thing we haven't talked about is brains evolved,\n\n1:52:24.020 --> 1:52:25.300\n didn't evolve for you to see,\n\n1:52:25.300 --> 1:52:26.980\n they didn't evolve for you to hear,\n\n1:52:26.980 --> 1:52:28.180\n they didn't evolve for you to feel,\n\n1:52:28.180 --> 1:52:30.020\n they evolved to control your body.\n\n1:52:30.020 --> 1:52:31.700\n That's why you have a brain.\n\n1:52:31.700 --> 1:52:34.260\n You have a brain so that it can control your body.\n\n1:52:34.260 --> 1:52:36.340\n And the metaphor,\n\n1:52:36.340 --> 1:52:39.220\n the scientific term for predictively controlling your body\n\n1:52:39.220 --> 1:52:40.540\n is allostasis.\n\n1:52:40.540 --> 1:52:45.540\n Your brain is attempting to anticipate the needs\n\n1:52:45.620 --> 1:52:48.180\n of your body and meet those needs before they arise\n\n1:52:48.180 --> 1:52:51.340\n so that you can act as you need to act.\n\n1:52:51.340 --> 1:52:55.060\n And the metaphor that I use is a body budget.\n\n1:52:55.060 --> 1:52:57.420\n You know, your brain is running a budget for your body.\n\n1:52:57.420 --> 1:52:58.540\n It's not budgeting money,\n\n1:52:58.540 --> 1:53:01.860\n it's budgeting glucose and salt and water.\n\n1:53:01.860 --> 1:53:04.180\n And instead of having, you know,\n\n1:53:04.180 --> 1:53:06.940\n one or two bank accounts, it has gazillions.\n\n1:53:06.940 --> 1:53:08.380\n There are all these systems in your body\n\n1:53:08.380 --> 1:53:10.820\n that have to be kept in balance.\n\n1:53:10.820 --> 1:53:14.460\n And it's monitoring very closely,\n\n1:53:14.460 --> 1:53:16.820\n it's making predictions about like,\n\n1:53:16.820 --> 1:53:19.620\n when is it good to spend and when is it good to save\n\n1:53:19.620 --> 1:53:21.140\n and what would be a good investment\n\n1:53:21.140 --> 1:53:23.860\n and am I gonna get a return on my investment?\n\n1:53:23.860 --> 1:53:27.060\n Whenever people talk about reward or reward prediction error\n\n1:53:27.060 --> 1:53:29.820\n or anything to do with reward or punishment,\n\n1:53:29.820 --> 1:53:32.900\n they're talking about the body budget.\n\n1:53:32.900 --> 1:53:34.540\n They're talking about your brain's predictions\n\n1:53:34.540 --> 1:53:37.780\n about whether or not there will be a deposit or withdrawal.\n\n1:53:39.440 --> 1:53:44.440\n So when your brain is running a deficit\n\n1:53:47.720 --> 1:53:48.640\n in your body budgets,\n\n1:53:48.640 --> 1:53:50.780\n you have some kind of metabolic imbalance,\n\n1:53:51.660 --> 1:53:55.080\n you experience that as discomfort.\n\n1:53:55.080 --> 1:53:57.140\n You experience that as distress.\n\n1:53:58.040 --> 1:54:00.980\n When your brain, when things are chaotic,\n\n1:54:00.980 --> 1:54:05.500\n you can't predict what's going to happen next.\n\n1:54:05.500 --> 1:54:08.840\n So I have this absolutely brilliant scientist\n\n1:54:08.840 --> 1:54:13.560\n working in my lab, his name is Jordan Theriot\n\n1:54:13.560 --> 1:54:17.040\n and he's published this really terrific paper\n\n1:54:17.040 --> 1:54:22.040\n on a sense of should, like why do we have social rules?\n\n1:54:22.040 --> 1:54:27.040\n Why do we adhere to social norms?\n\n1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:31.320\n It's because if I make myself predictable to you,\n\n1:54:31.320 --> 1:54:33.680\n then you are predictable to me.\n\n1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:36.760\n And if you're predictable to me, that's good\n\n1:54:36.760 --> 1:54:39.760\n because that is less metabolically expensive for me.\n\n1:54:41.520 --> 1:54:46.520\n Novelty or unpredictability at the extreme is expensive.\n\n1:54:46.520 --> 1:54:48.520\n And if it goes on for long enough,\n\n1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:50.760\n what happens is first of all,\n\n1:54:50.760 --> 1:54:53.760\n you will feel really jittery and antsy,\n\n1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:56.880\n which we describe as anxiety.\n\n1:54:56.880 --> 1:54:58.560\n It isn't necessarily anxiety.\n\n1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:03.560\n It could be just something is not predictable\n\n1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.400\n and you are experiencing arousal\n\n1:55:06.400 --> 1:55:09.920\n because the chemicals that help you learn\n\n1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:13.400\n increase your feeling of arousal basically.\n\n1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:15.160\n But if it goes on for long enough,\n\n1:55:15.160 --> 1:55:16.440\n you will become depleted\n\n1:55:17.900 --> 1:55:20.120\n and you will start to feel really, really,\n\n1:55:20.120 --> 1:55:22.080\n really distressed.\n\n1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:27.000\n So what we have is a culture full of people right now\n\n1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:30.800\n who their body budgets are just decimated\n\n1:55:32.120 --> 1:55:34.680\n and there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty.\n\n1:55:36.720 --> 1:55:39.720\n When you talk about it as depression and anxiety,\n\n1:55:39.720 --> 1:55:43.860\n it makes you think that it's not about your metabolism,\n\n1:55:43.860 --> 1:55:46.000\n that it's not about your body budgeting,\n\n1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:48.360\n that it's not about getting enough sleep\n\n1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:51.480\n or about eating well or about making sure\n\n1:55:51.480 --> 1:55:53.180\n that you have social connections.\n\n1:55:55.120 --> 1:55:57.000\n You think that it's something separate from that.\n\n1:55:57.000 --> 1:55:58.840\n But depression and anxiety are just a way\n\n1:55:58.840 --> 1:56:00.420\n of being in the world.\n\n1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:04.040\n They're a way of being in the world\n\n1:56:04.040 --> 1:56:06.860\n when things aren't quite right with your predictions.\n\n1:56:08.720 --> 1:56:10.600\n That's such a deep way of thinking.\n\n1:56:10.600 --> 1:56:15.600\n Like the brain is maintaining homeostasis.\n\n1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:17.880\n It's actually allostasis.\n\n1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:19.800\n I'm sorry.\n\n1:56:19.800 --> 1:56:22.840\n And it's constantly making predictions\n\n1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:24.420\n and metabolically speaking,\n\n1:56:24.420 --> 1:56:26.640\n it's very costly to make novel,\n\n1:56:26.640 --> 1:56:29.920\n like constantly be learning to making adjustments.\n\n1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:34.920\n And then over time, there's a cost to be paid\n\n1:56:35.240 --> 1:56:39.200\n if you're just in a place of chaos\n\n1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:42.760\n where there's constant need for adjusting\n\n1:56:42.760 --> 1:56:46.880\n and learning and experience novel things.\n\n1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:49.520\n And so part of the problem here,\n\n1:56:49.520 --> 1:56:50.480\n there are a couple of things.\n\n1:56:50.480 --> 1:56:52.400\n Like I said, it's a perfect storm.\n\n1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:54.760\n There isn't a single cause.\n\n1:56:54.760 --> 1:56:55.800\n There are multiple cause,\n\n1:56:55.800 --> 1:56:57.440\n multiple things that combine together.\n\n1:56:57.440 --> 1:57:00.540\n It's a complex system, multiple things.\n\n1:57:01.520 --> 1:57:06.520\n Part of it is that they're metabolically encumbered\n\n1:57:08.040 --> 1:57:09.240\n and they're distressed.\n\n1:57:10.120 --> 1:57:12.760\n And in order to try to have empathy\n\n1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:16.120\n for someone who is very much unlike you,\n\n1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:19.040\n you have to forage for information.\n\n1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:22.480\n You have to explore information\n\n1:57:22.480 --> 1:57:25.960\n that is novel to you and unexpected.\n\n1:57:25.960 --> 1:57:27.960\n And that's expensive.\n\n1:57:27.960 --> 1:57:31.040\n And at a time when people feel,\n\n1:57:31.040 --> 1:57:33.720\n what do you do when you are running a deficit\n\n1:57:33.720 --> 1:57:34.880\n in your bank account?\n\n1:57:34.880 --> 1:57:37.000\n You stop spending.\n\n1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:40.400\n What does it mean for a brain to stop spending?\n\n1:57:40.400 --> 1:57:43.160\n A brain stops moving very much,\n\n1:57:43.160 --> 1:57:46.920\n stops moving the body and it stops learning.\n\n1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:48.720\n It just goes with its internal model.\n\n1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:50.720\n Brilliantly put, yeah.\n\n1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:54.000\n So empathy requires,\n\n1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:56.640\n to have empathy for someone who is unlike you\n\n1:57:57.920 --> 1:58:02.920\n requires learning and practice, foraging for information.\n\n1:58:04.280 --> 1:58:07.200\n I mean, it is something I talk about in the book\n\n1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:08.800\n in seven and a half lessons about the brain.\n\n1:58:08.800 --> 1:58:10.440\n I think it's really important.\n\n1:58:10.440 --> 1:58:13.160\n It's hard, but it's hard.\n\n1:58:13.160 --> 1:58:16.520\n I think it's hard for people to have,\n\n1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:20.800\n to be curious about views that are unlike their own\n\n1:58:22.640 --> 1:58:26.360\n when they feel so encumbered.\n\n1:58:26.360 --> 1:58:29.200\n And I'll just tell you, I had this epiphany really.\n\n1:58:30.160 --> 1:58:34.640\n I was listening to Robert Reich's The System.\n\n1:58:34.640 --> 1:58:39.000\n He was talking about oligarchy versus democracy.\n\n1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:41.800\n And so oligarchy is where very wealthy people,\n\n1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:43.680\n like extremely wealthy people,\n\n1:58:46.480 --> 1:58:51.000\n shift power so that they become even more wealthy\n\n1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:52.400\n and even more insulated\n\n1:58:52.400 --> 1:58:56.480\n and from the pressures of the common person.\n\n1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:00.800\n It's actually the kind of system\n\n1:59:00.800 --> 1:59:04.120\n that leads to the collapse of civilizations\n\n1:59:04.120 --> 1:59:05.920\n if you believe Jared Diamond.\n\n1:59:05.920 --> 1:59:06.760\n Just say that.\n\n1:59:06.760 --> 1:59:08.640\n But anyways, I'm listening to this\n\n1:59:08.640 --> 1:59:13.640\n and I'm listening to him describe in fairly decent detail\n\n1:59:13.960 --> 1:59:18.560\n how the CEOs of these companies,\n\n1:59:18.560 --> 1:59:21.080\n there's been a shift in what it means to be a CEO\n\n1:59:21.080 --> 1:59:25.280\n and no longer being a steward of the community and so on,\n\n1:59:25.280 --> 1:59:27.440\n but like in the 1980s, it sort of shifted\n\n1:59:27.440 --> 1:59:30.680\n to this other model of being like an oligarch.\n\n1:59:30.680 --> 1:59:35.120\n And he's talking about how it used to be the case\n\n1:59:35.120 --> 1:59:40.120\n that CEOs made like 20 times what their employees made\n\n1:59:45.240 --> 1:59:48.000\n and now they make about 300 times on average\n\n1:59:48.000 --> 1:59:49.080\n what their employees made.\n\n1:59:49.080 --> 1:59:50.760\n So where did that money come from?\n\n1:59:51.640 --> 1:59:53.960\n It came from the pockets of the employees.\n\n1:59:55.040 --> 1:59:57.360\n And they don't know about it, right?\n\n1:59:57.360 --> 1:59:58.360\n No one knows about it.\n\n1:59:58.360 --> 2:00:00.960\n They just know they can't feed their children,\n\n2:00:00.960 --> 2:00:03.400\n they can't pay for healthcare,\n\n2:00:03.400 --> 2:00:05.240\n they can't take care of their family\n\n2:00:05.240 --> 2:00:08.280\n and they worry about what's gonna happen to their,\n\n2:00:08.280 --> 2:00:11.280\n they're living like months a month basically.\n\n2:00:11.280 --> 2:00:13.960\n Any one big bill could completely\n\n2:00:13.960 --> 2:00:15.240\n put them out on the street.\n\n2:00:15.240 --> 2:00:17.880\n So there are a huge number of people living like this.\n\n2:00:17.880 --> 2:00:19.880\n So all they, what they're experiencing,\n\n2:00:19.880 --> 2:00:22.280\n they don't know why they're experiencing it.\n\n2:00:22.280 --> 2:00:26.720\n And then someone comes along and gives them a narrative.\n\n2:00:26.720 --> 2:00:29.880\n Well, somebody else butted in line in front of you\n\n2:00:29.880 --> 2:00:32.960\n and that's why you're this way.\n\n2:00:32.960 --> 2:00:35.120\n That's why you experience what you're experiencing.\n\n2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:39.280\n And just for a minute, I was thinking,\n\n2:00:39.280 --> 2:00:44.280\n I had deep empathy for people who have beliefs\n\n2:00:44.640 --> 2:00:49.320\n that are really, really, really different from mine.\n\n2:00:50.360 --> 2:00:55.360\n But I was trying really hard to see it through their eyes.\n\n2:00:55.440 --> 2:00:59.320\n And did it cost me something metabolically?\n\n2:00:59.320 --> 2:01:02.080\n I'm sure, I'm sure.\n\n2:01:02.080 --> 2:01:04.640\n But you had something in the gas tank.\n\n2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:07.120\n Well, I. In order to allocate that.\n\n2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:08.600\n I mean, that's the question is like,\n\n2:01:08.600 --> 2:01:13.080\n where did you, what resources did your brain draw on\n\n2:01:13.080 --> 2:01:14.680\n in order to actually make that effort?\n\n2:01:14.680 --> 2:01:17.520\n Well, I'll tell you something, honestly, Lex.\n\n2:01:17.520 --> 2:01:19.920\n I don't have that much in the gas tank right now.\n\n2:01:19.920 --> 2:01:24.920\n Right, so I am surfing the stress that,\n\n2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:28.560\n stress is just, what is stress?\n\n2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:31.680\n Stress is your brain is preparing for a big metabolic outlay\n\n2:01:31.680 --> 2:01:33.560\n and it just keeps preparing and preparing\n\n2:01:33.560 --> 2:01:35.240\n and preparing and preparing.\n\n2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:37.480\n You as a professor, you as a human.\n\n2:01:37.480 --> 2:01:39.040\n Both, right?\n\n2:01:39.040 --> 2:01:42.680\n For me, this is a moment of existential crisis\n\n2:01:42.680 --> 2:01:45.480\n as much as anybody else, democracy, all of these things.\n\n2:01:45.480 --> 2:01:50.360\n So in many of my roles, so I guess what I'm trying to say\n\n2:01:50.360 --> 2:01:55.360\n is that I get up every morning and I exercise.\n\n2:01:55.360 --> 2:01:58.880\n I run, I row, I lift weights, right?\n\n2:01:58.880 --> 2:02:00.360\n You exercise in the middle of the day.\n\n2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:03.160\n I saw your like, you know, daily thing.\n\n2:02:03.160 --> 2:02:06.000\n Yeah, I hate it actually.\n\n2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:07.040\n You love it, right?\n\n2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:07.880\n You get a...\n\n2:02:07.880 --> 2:02:08.700\n No, I hate it.\n\n2:02:08.700 --> 2:02:13.400\n I hate it, but I do it religiously.\n\n2:02:13.400 --> 2:02:14.520\n Why?\n\n2:02:14.520 --> 2:02:16.560\n Because it's a really good investment.\n\n2:02:16.560 --> 2:02:20.320\n It's an expenditure that is a really good investment.\n\n2:02:20.320 --> 2:02:25.320\n And so when I was exercising, I was listening to the book\n\n2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:28.320\n and when I realized the insights that I was sort of like\n\n2:02:28.320 --> 2:02:31.200\n playing around with, like, is this, does this make sense?\n\n2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:32.040\n Does this make sense?\n\n2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:34.320\n I didn't immediately plunge into it.\n\n2:02:34.320 --> 2:02:38.080\n I basically wrote some stuff down, I set it aside\n\n2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:42.320\n and then I did what I prepared myself to make an expenditure.\n\n2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:44.720\n I don't know what you do before you exercise.\n\n2:02:44.720 --> 2:02:48.200\n I always have a protein shake, always have a protein shake\n\n2:02:48.200 --> 2:02:50.120\n because I need to fuel up\n\n2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:52.280\n before I make this really big expenditure.\n\n2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:55.640\n And so I did the same thing.\n\n2:02:55.640 --> 2:02:58.920\n I didn't have a protein drink, but I did the same thing.\n\n2:02:58.920 --> 2:03:01.640\n And fueling up can mean lots of different things.\n\n2:03:01.640 --> 2:03:03.520\n It can mean talking to a friend about it.\n\n2:03:03.520 --> 2:03:07.160\n It can mean, you know, it can mean making sure\n\n2:03:07.160 --> 2:03:08.800\n you get a good night's sleep before you do it.\n\n2:03:08.800 --> 2:03:10.320\n It can mean lots of different things,\n\n2:03:10.320 --> 2:03:15.320\n but I guess I think we have to do these things.\n\n2:03:17.840 --> 2:03:20.640\n Yeah, that's a good question.\n\n2:03:20.640 --> 2:03:24.320\n Yeah, I'm gonna re listen to this conversation\n\n2:03:24.320 --> 2:03:26.320\n several times, this is brilliant.\n\n2:03:26.320 --> 2:03:31.320\n But I do think about, you know, I've encountered\n\n2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:35.560\n so many people that can't possibly imagine\n\n2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:38.560\n that a good human being can vote for Donald Trump.\n\n2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:43.560\n And I've also encountered people that can't imagine\n\n2:03:43.880 --> 2:03:47.880\n that an intelligent person can possibly vote for Democrat.\n\n2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:52.040\n And I look at both these people,\n\n2:03:52.040 --> 2:03:57.040\n many of whom are friends, and let's just say,\n\n2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:00.280\n after this conversation, I can see as they're predicting\n\n2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:04.360\n brains not willing to invest the resources\n\n2:04:04.360 --> 2:04:06.160\n to empathize with the other side.\n\n2:04:06.160 --> 2:04:10.000\n And I think you have to in order to be able to,\n\n2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:14.520\n like, to see the obvious common humanity in us.\n\n2:04:14.520 --> 2:04:16.100\n I don't know what the system is\n\n2:04:16.100 --> 2:04:17.840\n that's creating this division.\n\n2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:20.240\n We can put it, like you said, it's a perfect storm.\n\n2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:22.200\n It might be the social media,\n\n2:04:22.200 --> 2:04:23.040\n I don't know what the hell it is.\n\n2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:24.540\n I think it's a bunch of things.\n\n2:04:24.540 --> 2:04:27.560\n I think it's, there's an economic system,\n\n2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:30.960\n which is disadvantaging large numbers of people.\n\n2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:34.420\n There's a use of social media.\n\n2:04:34.420 --> 2:04:37.360\n Like if you, you know, if I had to orchestrate\n\n2:04:37.360 --> 2:04:40.960\n or architect a system that would screw up\n\n2:04:40.960 --> 2:04:44.360\n a human body budget, it would be the one that we live in.\n\n2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:45.600\n You know, we don't sleep enough.\n\n2:04:45.600 --> 2:04:48.960\n We eat pseudo food, basically.\n\n2:04:48.960 --> 2:04:51.600\n We are on social media too much,\n\n2:04:51.600 --> 2:04:52.920\n which is full of ambiguity,\n\n2:04:52.920 --> 2:04:55.980\n which is really hard for a human nervous system, right?\n\n2:04:55.980 --> 2:04:57.060\n Really, really hard.\n\n2:04:57.060 --> 2:04:59.700\n Like ambiguity with no context to predict in.\n\n2:04:59.700 --> 2:05:01.160\n I mean, it's like, really?\n\n2:05:01.160 --> 2:05:03.800\n And then, you know, there are the economic concerns\n\n2:05:03.800 --> 2:05:06.280\n that affect large swaths of people in this country.\n\n2:05:06.280 --> 2:05:09.300\n I mean, it's really, I'm not saying everything\n\n2:05:09.300 --> 2:05:11.780\n is reducible to metabolism.\n\n2:05:11.780 --> 2:05:13.600\n Not everything is reducible to metabolism,\n\n2:05:13.600 --> 2:05:18.500\n but there, if you combine all these things together.\n\n2:05:18.500 --> 2:05:20.080\n It's helpful to think of it that way.\n\n2:05:20.080 --> 2:05:22.180\n Then somehow it's also,\n\n2:05:24.040 --> 2:05:27.040\n somehow it reduces the entirety of the human experience,\n\n2:05:27.040 --> 2:05:28.520\n the same kind of obvious logic.\n\n2:05:28.520 --> 2:05:31.720\n Like we should exercise every day in the same kind of way.\n\n2:05:31.720 --> 2:05:34.880\n We should empathize every day.\n\n2:05:34.880 --> 2:05:35.880\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:35.880 --> 2:05:37.720\n You know, there are these really wonderful,\n\n2:05:37.720 --> 2:05:41.580\n wonderful programs for teens\n\n2:05:41.580 --> 2:05:44.160\n and sometimes also for parents of people\n\n2:05:44.160 --> 2:05:47.480\n who've lost children in wars and in conflicts,\n\n2:05:47.480 --> 2:05:48.940\n in political conflicts,\n\n2:05:48.940 --> 2:05:51.540\n where they go to a bucolic setting\n\n2:05:51.540 --> 2:05:54.020\n and they talk to each other about their experiences.\n\n2:05:54.020 --> 2:05:59.020\n And miraculous things happen, you know?\n\n2:05:59.120 --> 2:06:04.120\n So, you know, it's easy to sort of shrug this stuff off\n\n2:06:04.120 --> 2:06:09.120\n It's easy to sort of shrug this stuff off\n\n2:06:10.160 --> 2:06:12.200\n as kind of Pollyanna ish.\n\n2:06:12.200 --> 2:06:13.800\n You know, like, what's this really gonna do?\n\n2:06:13.800 --> 2:06:18.620\n But you have to think about,\n\n2:06:20.120 --> 2:06:23.520\n when my daughter went to college, I gave her advice.\n\n2:06:23.520 --> 2:06:28.520\n I said, try to be around people\n\n2:06:29.400 --> 2:06:32.080\n who let you be the kind of person you wanna be.\n\n2:06:32.080 --> 2:06:35.640\n We're back to free will.\n\n2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:40.360\n You have a choice, you have a choice.\n\n2:06:40.360 --> 2:06:41.960\n It might seem like a really hard choice.\n\n2:06:41.960 --> 2:06:46.080\n It might seem like an unimaginably difficult choice.\n\n2:06:46.080 --> 2:06:47.280\n You have a choice.\n\n2:06:47.280 --> 2:06:52.280\n Do you wanna be somebody who is wrapped in fury and agony?\n\n2:06:54.600 --> 2:06:59.280\n Or do you wanna be somebody who extends a little empathy\n\n2:06:59.280 --> 2:07:00.100\n to somebody else?\n\n2:07:00.100 --> 2:07:02.720\n And in the process, maybe learn something.\n\n2:07:02.720 --> 2:07:07.440\n Curiosity is the thing that protects you.\n\n2:07:07.440 --> 2:07:12.440\n Curiosity is the thing, it's curative curiosity.\n\n2:07:12.460 --> 2:07:15.480\n On social media, the thing I recommend to people,\n\n2:07:16.760 --> 2:07:20.000\n at least that's the way I've been approaching social media.\n\n2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.040\n It doesn't seem to be the common approach,\n\n2:07:22.040 --> 2:07:27.040\n but I basically give love to people\n\n2:07:27.040 --> 2:07:30.620\n who seem to also give love to others.\n\n2:07:30.620 --> 2:07:34.420\n So it's the same similar concept of surrounding yourself\n\n2:07:34.420 --> 2:07:36.260\n by the people you wanna become.\n\n2:07:36.260 --> 2:07:40.460\n And I ignore, sometimes block, but just ignore.\n\n2:07:40.460 --> 2:07:43.260\n I don't add aggression to people\n\n2:07:43.260 --> 2:07:46.420\n who are just constantly full of aggression\n\n2:07:46.420 --> 2:07:48.420\n and negativity and toxicity.\n\n2:07:48.420 --> 2:07:52.380\n There's a certain desire when somebody says something mean\n\n2:07:52.380 --> 2:07:57.380\n to say something, to say why,\n\n2:07:59.020 --> 2:08:01.720\n or try to alleviate the meanness and so on.\n\n2:08:01.720 --> 2:08:03.060\n But what you're doing essentially\n\n2:08:03.060 --> 2:08:05.620\n is you're now surrounding yourself\n\n2:08:05.620 --> 2:08:09.220\n by that group of folks that have that negativity.\n\n2:08:09.220 --> 2:08:11.220\n So even just the conversation.\n\n2:08:11.220 --> 2:08:15.540\n So I think it's just so powerful\n\n2:08:15.540 --> 2:08:18.500\n to put yourself amongst people\n\n2:08:18.500 --> 2:08:23.500\n whose basic mode of interaction is kindness.\n\n2:08:23.900 --> 2:08:26.980\n Because I don't know what it is,\n\n2:08:26.980 --> 2:08:28.680\n but maybe it's the way I'm built,\n\n2:08:28.680 --> 2:08:32.180\n is that to me is energizing for the gas tank\n\n2:08:32.180 --> 2:08:36.380\n that then I can pull to when I start reading\n\n2:08:36.380 --> 2:08:38.100\n The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\n\n2:08:38.100 --> 2:08:40.980\n and start thinking about Nazi Germany.\n\n2:08:40.980 --> 2:08:43.620\n I can empathize with everybody involved.\n\n2:08:43.620 --> 2:08:47.820\n I can start to make these difficult thinking\n\n2:08:47.820 --> 2:08:52.140\n that's required to understand our little planet Earth.\n\n2:08:52.140 --> 2:08:54.820\n Well, there is research to back up what you said.\n\n2:08:54.820 --> 2:08:56.580\n There's research that's consistent\n\n2:08:56.580 --> 2:08:58.500\n with your intuition there,\n\n2:08:58.500 --> 2:09:00.660\n that there's research that shows\n\n2:09:00.660 --> 2:09:04.060\n that being kind to other people,\n\n2:09:04.060 --> 2:09:05.860\n doing something nice for someone else\n\n2:09:06.900 --> 2:09:11.340\n is like making a deposit to some extent.\n\n2:09:11.340 --> 2:09:15.860\n Because I think making a deposit\n\n2:09:15.860 --> 2:09:17.220\n not only in their body budgets,\n\n2:09:17.220 --> 2:09:18.820\n but also in yours.\n\n2:09:18.820 --> 2:09:22.500\n Like people feel good when they do good things\n\n2:09:22.500 --> 2:09:24.180\n for other people.\n\n2:09:24.180 --> 2:09:26.060\n We are social animals.\n\n2:09:26.060 --> 2:09:28.300\n We regulate each other's nervous systems\n\n2:09:28.300 --> 2:09:30.780\n for better and for worse, right?\n\n2:09:30.780 --> 2:09:35.520\n The best thing for a human nervous system is another human.\n\n2:09:36.820 --> 2:09:40.540\n And the worst thing for a human nervous system\n\n2:09:40.540 --> 2:09:41.820\n is another human.\n\n2:09:41.820 --> 2:09:44.540\n So you decide, do you wanna be somebody\n\n2:09:44.540 --> 2:09:49.540\n who makes people feel better\n\n2:09:49.860 --> 2:09:53.200\n or do you wanna be somebody who causes people pain?\n\n2:09:53.200 --> 2:09:58.200\n And we are more responsible for one another\n\n2:09:58.220 --> 2:10:02.520\n than we might like or than we might want.\n\n2:10:02.520 --> 2:10:05.460\n But remember what we said about social reality.\n\n2:10:05.460 --> 2:10:10.460\n Social reality, there are lots of different cultural norms\n\n2:10:10.460 --> 2:10:15.460\n about independence or collective nature of people.\n\n2:10:20.100 --> 2:10:24.980\n But the fact is we have socially dependent nervous systems.\n\n2:10:24.980 --> 2:10:27.620\n We evolved that way as a species.\n\n2:10:27.620 --> 2:10:29.420\n And in this country,\n\n2:10:29.420 --> 2:10:32.880\n we prize individual rights and freedoms.\n\n2:10:32.880 --> 2:10:37.880\n And that is a dilemma that we have to grapple with.\n\n2:10:38.560 --> 2:10:40.100\n And we have to do it in a way\n\n2:10:40.100 --> 2:10:41.580\n if we're gonna be productive about it.\n\n2:10:41.580 --> 2:10:43.180\n We have to do it in a way\n\n2:10:43.180 --> 2:10:48.180\n that requires engaging with each other,\n\n2:10:48.500 --> 2:10:50.340\n and which is what I understand\n\n2:10:50.340 --> 2:10:55.340\n the founding members of this country intended.\n\n2:10:57.700 --> 2:10:58.580\n Beautifully put.\n\n2:10:58.580 --> 2:11:01.820\n Let me ask a few final silly questions.\n\n2:11:01.820 --> 2:11:05.300\n So one, talked a bit about love,\n\n2:11:05.300 --> 2:11:08.620\n but it's fun to ask somebody like you\n\n2:11:08.620 --> 2:11:13.140\n who can effectively, from at least neuroscience perspective,\n\n2:11:13.140 --> 2:11:15.060\n disassemble some of these romantic notions.\n\n2:11:15.060 --> 2:11:17.540\n But what do you make of romantic love?\n\n2:11:18.380 --> 2:11:22.020\n Why do human beings seem to fall in love?\n\n2:11:22.020 --> 2:11:26.220\n At least a bunch of 80s hair bands have written about it.\n\n2:11:27.740 --> 2:11:29.700\n Is that a nice feature to have?\n\n2:11:29.700 --> 2:11:31.100\n Is that a bug?\n\n2:11:31.100 --> 2:11:31.940\n What is it?\n\n2:11:31.940 --> 2:11:35.100\n Well, I'm really happy that I fell in love.\n\n2:11:35.100 --> 2:11:37.620\n I wouldn't want it any other way.\n\n2:11:37.620 --> 2:11:38.940\n But I would say.\n\n2:11:38.940 --> 2:11:41.740\n Is that you the person speaking or the neuroscientist?\n\n2:11:41.740 --> 2:11:44.060\n Well, that's me the person speaking.\n\n2:11:44.060 --> 2:11:47.460\n But I would say as a neuroscientist,\n\n2:11:47.460 --> 2:11:51.340\n babies are born not able to regulate their own body budgets\n\n2:11:51.340 --> 2:11:53.660\n because their brains aren't fully wired yet.\n\n2:11:54.580 --> 2:11:59.580\n When you feed a baby, when you cuddle a baby,\n\n2:12:00.740 --> 2:12:02.220\n everything you do with a baby\n\n2:12:02.220 --> 2:12:04.460\n impacts that baby's body budget\n\n2:12:04.460 --> 2:12:09.460\n and helps to wire that baby's brain\n\n2:12:09.900 --> 2:12:13.580\n to manage eventually her own body budget to some extent.\n\n2:12:13.580 --> 2:12:17.340\n That's the basis biologically of attachment.\n\n2:12:20.340 --> 2:12:25.340\n Humans evolved as a species to be socially dependent,\n\n2:12:26.780 --> 2:12:31.780\n meaning you cannot manage your body budget\n\n2:12:31.780 --> 2:12:35.740\n on your own without a tax\n\n2:12:35.740 --> 2:12:40.180\n that eventually you pay many years later\n\n2:12:40.180 --> 2:12:42.740\n in terms of some metabolic illness.\n\n2:12:43.620 --> 2:12:47.740\n Loneliness, when you break up with someone that you love\n\n2:12:47.740 --> 2:12:52.300\n or you lose them, you feel like it's gonna kill you,\n\n2:12:52.300 --> 2:12:53.380\n but it doesn't.\n\n2:12:53.380 --> 2:12:55.300\n But loneliness will kill you.\n\n2:12:55.300 --> 2:12:57.740\n It will kill you approximately,\n\n2:12:57.740 --> 2:12:59.380\n what is it, seven years earlier?\n\n2:12:59.380 --> 2:13:01.060\n I can't remember exactly the exact number.\n\n2:13:01.060 --> 2:13:05.260\n It's actually in the web notes to seven and a half lessons.\n\n2:13:05.260 --> 2:13:10.260\n But social isolation and loneliness will kill you earlier\n\n2:13:10.460 --> 2:13:11.780\n than you would otherwise die.\n\n2:13:11.780 --> 2:13:15.740\n And the reason why is that you didn't evolve\n\n2:13:15.740 --> 2:13:18.540\n to manage your nervous system on your own.\n\n2:13:18.540 --> 2:13:20.740\n And when you do, you pay a little tax\n\n2:13:20.740 --> 2:13:24.300\n and that tax accrues very slightly over time,\n\n2:13:24.300 --> 2:13:26.260\n over a long period of time\n\n2:13:26.260 --> 2:13:30.620\n so that by the time you're in middle age or a little older,\n\n2:13:30.620 --> 2:13:33.660\n you are more likely to die sooner\n\n2:13:33.660 --> 2:13:35.260\n from some metabolic illness,\n\n2:13:35.260 --> 2:13:38.700\n from heart disease, from diabetes, from depression.\n\n2:13:38.700 --> 2:13:40.860\n You're more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease.\n\n2:13:40.860 --> 2:13:45.860\n I mean, it takes a long time for that tax to accrue,\n\n2:13:47.020 --> 2:13:47.860\n but it does.\n\n2:13:47.860 --> 2:13:52.860\n So yes, I think it's a good thing for people to fall in love.\n\n2:13:53.820 --> 2:13:58.300\n But I think the funny view of it is that it's clear\n\n2:13:58.300 --> 2:14:01.900\n that humans need the social attachment\n\n2:14:01.900 --> 2:14:05.580\n to, what is it, manage their nervous system\n\n2:14:05.580 --> 2:14:08.500\n as you're describing.\n\n2:14:08.500 --> 2:14:12.300\n And the reason you wanna stay with somebody for a long time\n\n2:14:12.300 --> 2:14:16.500\n is so you don't have, is the novelty is very costly for.\n\n2:14:16.500 --> 2:14:18.580\n Well, now you're mixing thing.\n\n2:14:18.580 --> 2:14:21.540\n Now you're, you know, you have to decide whether.\n\n2:14:21.540 --> 2:14:25.180\n But what I would say is when you lose someone you love,\n\n2:14:25.180 --> 2:14:29.740\n it feels like you've lost a part of you.\n\n2:14:29.740 --> 2:14:31.340\n And that's because you have.\n\n2:14:32.260 --> 2:14:36.020\n You've lost someone who was contributing\n\n2:14:36.020 --> 2:14:37.340\n to your body budget.\n\n2:14:37.340 --> 2:14:40.500\n We are the caretakers of one another's nervous systems,\n\n2:14:40.500 --> 2:14:41.780\n like it or not.\n\n2:14:41.780 --> 2:14:46.780\n And out of that comes very deep feelings of attachment,\n\n2:14:47.260 --> 2:14:50.220\n some of which are romantic love.\n\n2:14:50.220 --> 2:14:55.220\n Are you afraid of your own mortality?\n\n2:14:55.940 --> 2:14:57.420\n We're two humans sitting here.\n\n2:14:57.420 --> 2:15:01.780\n Do you think, do you ponder your own mortality?\n\n2:15:01.780 --> 2:15:05.580\n I mean, somebody thinks about your brain a lot.\n\n2:15:05.580 --> 2:15:10.580\n It seems one of the more terrifying or, I don't know.\n\n2:15:12.700 --> 2:15:13.860\n I don't know how to feel about it,\n\n2:15:13.860 --> 2:15:16.140\n but it seems to be one of the most definitive aspects\n\n2:15:16.140 --> 2:15:18.500\n of life is that it ends.\n\n2:15:18.500 --> 2:15:21.340\n It's a complicated answer, but I think the best I can do\n\n2:15:21.340 --> 2:15:24.220\n in a short snippet would be to say,\n\n2:15:24.220 --> 2:15:27.820\n for a very long time, I did not fear my own mortality.\n\n2:15:27.820 --> 2:15:32.820\n I feared pain and suffering.\n\n2:15:33.980 --> 2:15:36.060\n So that's what I feared.\n\n2:15:36.060 --> 2:15:38.740\n I feared being harmed or dying in a way\n\n2:15:38.740 --> 2:15:39.980\n that would be painful.\n\n2:15:41.900 --> 2:15:45.580\n But I didn't fear having my life be over.\n\n2:15:45.580 --> 2:15:50.580\n Now, as a mother, I think I fear dying\n\n2:15:54.380 --> 2:15:59.380\n before my daughter is ready to be without me.\n\n2:16:03.340 --> 2:16:04.580\n That's what I fear.\n\n2:16:05.460 --> 2:16:10.380\n It's, that's really what I fear.\n\n2:16:10.380 --> 2:16:13.820\n And frankly, honestly, I fear my husband dying before me\n\n2:16:13.820 --> 2:16:15.620\n much more than I fear my own death.\n\n2:16:16.700 --> 2:16:19.300\n There's that love and social attachment again.\n\n2:16:19.300 --> 2:16:23.020\n Yeah, because I know it's just gonna,\n\n2:16:23.020 --> 2:16:25.220\n I'm gonna feel like I wish I was dead.\n\n2:16:27.020 --> 2:16:29.220\n A final question about life.\n\n2:16:29.220 --> 2:16:31.300\n What do you think is the meaning of it all?\n\n2:16:32.220 --> 2:16:33.540\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n2:16:36.300 --> 2:16:38.780\n Yeah, I think that there isn't one meaning of life.\n\n2:16:38.780 --> 2:16:41.020\n There's like many meanings of life.\n\n2:16:41.020 --> 2:16:43.860\n And you use different ones on different days.\n\n2:16:43.860 --> 2:16:45.260\n But for me.\n\n2:16:45.260 --> 2:16:46.300\n Depending on the day.\n\n2:16:46.300 --> 2:16:47.140\n Depending on the day.\n\n2:16:47.140 --> 2:16:51.700\n But for me, I would say sometimes the meaning of life\n\n2:16:51.700 --> 2:16:55.780\n is to understand, to make meaning actually.\n\n2:16:55.780 --> 2:16:58.540\n The meaning of life is to make meaning.\n\n2:16:58.540 --> 2:16:59.940\n Sometimes it's that.\n\n2:16:59.940 --> 2:17:03.660\n Sometimes it's to leave the world\n\n2:17:03.660 --> 2:17:06.460\n just slightly a little bit better\n\n2:17:06.460 --> 2:17:09.860\n than like the Johnny Appleseed view, you know?\n\n2:17:09.860 --> 2:17:14.860\n Sometimes the meaning of life is to clear the path\n\n2:17:21.580 --> 2:17:24.620\n for my daughter or for my students.\n\n2:17:26.740 --> 2:17:28.340\n So sometimes it's that.\n\n2:17:28.340 --> 2:17:30.380\n And sometimes it's just,\n\n2:17:34.380 --> 2:17:38.700\n even in moments where you're looking at the sky\n\n2:17:38.700 --> 2:17:42.780\n or you're by the ocean.\n\n2:17:42.780 --> 2:17:45.180\n Or sometimes for me it's even like\n\n2:17:45.180 --> 2:17:50.180\n I'll see a weed poking out of a crack\n\n2:17:51.060 --> 2:17:52.980\n in a sidewalk, you know?\n\n2:17:52.980 --> 2:17:56.620\n And you just have this overwhelming sense\n\n2:17:56.620 --> 2:18:01.620\n of the wonder of the world.\n\n2:18:03.300 --> 2:18:06.580\n Like the world is, just like the physical world\n\n2:18:06.580 --> 2:18:11.580\n is so wondrous and you just get very immersed\n\n2:18:12.780 --> 2:18:17.780\n in the moment, like the sensation of the moment.\n\n2:18:18.220 --> 2:18:19.860\n Sometimes that's the meaning of life.\n\n2:18:19.860 --> 2:18:21.740\n I don't think there's one meaning of life.\n\n2:18:21.740 --> 2:18:24.460\n I think it's a population of instances\n\n2:18:24.460 --> 2:18:27.540\n just like any other category.\n\n2:18:28.460 --> 2:18:30.820\n I don't think there's a better way to end it, Lisa.\n\n2:18:30.820 --> 2:18:35.820\n The first time we spoke is I think if not the,\n\n2:18:35.820 --> 2:18:39.980\n then one of, I think it's the first conversation I had\n\n2:18:39.980 --> 2:18:41.740\n that basically launched this podcast.\n\n2:18:41.740 --> 2:18:43.700\n Yeah, that's actually the first conversation\n\n2:18:43.700 --> 2:18:45.660\n I've had that launched this podcast.\n\n2:18:45.660 --> 2:18:49.180\n And now we get to finally do it the right way.\n\n2:18:49.180 --> 2:18:50.580\n It's a huge honor to talk to you,\n\n2:18:50.580 --> 2:18:51.940\n that you spent time with me.\n\n2:18:53.020 --> 2:18:56.620\n I can't wait for hopefully the many more books you write.\n\n2:18:56.620 --> 2:19:00.500\n Certainly can't wait to, I already read this book,\n\n2:19:00.500 --> 2:19:02.140\n but I can't wait to listen to it\n\n2:19:02.140 --> 2:19:05.980\n because as you said offline that you're reading it\n\n2:19:05.980 --> 2:19:07.460\n and I think you have a great voice.\n\n2:19:07.460 --> 2:19:10.020\n You have a great, I don't know what the nice way to put it,\n\n2:19:10.020 --> 2:19:14.660\n but maybe NPR voice in the best version of what that is.\n\n2:19:14.660 --> 2:19:16.540\n So thanks again for talking today.\n\n2:19:16.540 --> 2:19:17.380\n Oh, it's my pleasure.\n\n2:19:17.380 --> 2:19:19.980\n Thank you
