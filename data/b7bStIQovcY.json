  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:03.440\n The following is a conversation with Thomas Sanholm.\n\n00:03.440 --> 00:06.880\n He's a professor at CMU and co creator of Labratus,\n\n00:06.880 --> 00:09.880\n which is the first AI system to beat top human players\n\n00:09.880 --> 00:13.000\n in the game of Heads Up No Limit Texas Holdem.\n\n00:13.000 --> 00:15.600\n He has published over 450 papers\n\n00:15.600 --> 00:17.320\n on game theory and machine learning,\n\n00:17.320 --> 00:21.120\n including a best paper in 2017 at NIPS,\n\n00:21.120 --> 00:23.560\n now renamed to Newrips,\n\n00:23.560 --> 00:27.040\n which is where I caught up with him for this conversation.\n\n00:27.040 --> 00:30.680\n His research and companies have had wide reaching impact\n\n00:30.680 --> 00:32.160\n in the real world,\n\n00:32.160 --> 00:34.400\n especially because he and his group\n\n00:34.400 --> 00:36.640\n not only propose new ideas,\n\n00:36.640 --> 00:40.440\n but also build systems to prove that these ideas work\n\n00:40.440 --> 00:42.120\n in the real world.\n\n00:42.120 --> 00:44.640\n This conversation is part of the MIT course\n\n00:44.640 --> 00:46.440\n on artificial general intelligence\n\n00:46.440 --> 00:49.040\n and the artificial intelligence podcast.\n\n00:49.040 --> 00:52.400\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes,\n\n00:52.400 --> 00:54.320\n or simply connect with me on Twitter\n\n00:54.320 --> 00:58.080\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D.\n\n00:58.080 --> 01:02.120\n And now here's my conversation with Thomas Sanholm.\n\n01:03.080 --> 01:06.120\n Can you describe at the high level\n\n01:06.120 --> 01:09.320\n the game of poker, Texas Holdem, Heads Up Texas Holdem\n\n01:09.320 --> 01:13.280\n for people who might not be familiar with this card game?\n\n01:13.280 --> 01:14.440\n Yeah, happy to.\n\n01:14.440 --> 01:16.520\n So Heads Up No Limit Texas Holdem\n\n01:16.520 --> 01:18.840\n has really emerged in the AI community\n\n01:18.840 --> 01:21.360\n as a main benchmark for testing these\n\n01:21.360 --> 01:23.560\n application independent algorithms\n\n01:23.560 --> 01:26.440\n for imperfect information game solving.\n\n01:26.440 --> 01:30.960\n And this is a game that's actually played by humans.\n\n01:30.960 --> 01:33.960\n You don't see that much on TV or casinos\n\n01:33.960 --> 01:36.160\n because well, for various reasons,\n\n01:36.160 --> 01:40.240\n but you do see it in some expert level casinos\n\n01:40.240 --> 01:43.080\n and you see it in the best poker movies of all time.\n\n01:43.080 --> 01:45.720\n It's actually an event in the World Series of Poker,\n\n01:45.720 --> 01:48.200\n but mostly it's played online\n\n01:48.200 --> 01:50.880\n and typically for pretty big sums of money.\n\n01:50.880 --> 01:54.560\n And this is a game that usually only experts play.\n\n01:54.560 --> 01:58.720\n So if you go to your home game on a Friday night,\n\n01:58.720 --> 02:01.280\n it probably is not gonna be Heads Up No Limit Texas Holdem.\n\n02:01.280 --> 02:04.640\n It might be No Limit Texas Holdem in some cases,\n\n02:04.640 --> 02:08.720\n but typically for a big group and it's not as competitive.\n\n02:08.720 --> 02:10.520\n While Heads Up means it's two players.\n\n02:10.520 --> 02:13.360\n So it's really like me against you.\n\n02:13.360 --> 02:14.680\n Am I better or are you better?\n\n02:14.680 --> 02:17.520\n Much like chess or go in that sense,\n\n02:17.520 --> 02:19.520\n but an imperfect information game,\n\n02:19.520 --> 02:21.520\n which makes it much harder because I have to deal\n\n02:21.520 --> 02:25.560\n with issues of you knowing things that I don't know\n\n02:25.560 --> 02:27.200\n and I know things that you don't know\n\n02:27.200 --> 02:29.720\n instead of pieces being nicely laid on the board\n\n02:29.720 --> 02:31.120\n for both of us to see.\n\n02:31.120 --> 02:34.840\n So in Texas Holdem, there's two cards\n\n02:34.840 --> 02:37.440\n that you only see that belong to you.\n\n02:37.440 --> 02:38.520\n Yeah. And there is,\n\n02:38.520 --> 02:40.400\n they gradually lay out some cards\n\n02:40.400 --> 02:44.080\n that add up overall to five cards that everybody can see.\n\n02:44.080 --> 02:45.720\n Yeah. So the imperfect nature\n\n02:45.720 --> 02:47.560\n of the information is the two cards\n\n02:47.560 --> 02:48.400\n that you're holding in your hand.\n\n02:48.400 --> 02:49.380\n Up front, yeah.\n\n02:49.380 --> 02:51.840\n So as you said, you first get two cards\n\n02:51.840 --> 02:55.200\n in private each and then there's a betting round.\n\n02:55.200 --> 02:58.320\n Then you get three cards in public on the table.\n\n02:58.320 --> 02:59.240\n Then there's a betting round.\n\n02:59.240 --> 03:01.680\n Then you get the fourth card in public on the table.\n\n03:01.680 --> 03:02.580\n There's a betting round.\n\n03:02.580 --> 03:04.920\n Then you get the 5th card on the table.\n\n03:04.920 --> 03:05.760\n There's a betting round.\n\n03:05.760 --> 03:07.480\n So there's a total of four betting rounds\n\n03:07.480 --> 03:11.140\n and four tranches of information revelation if you will.\n\n03:11.140 --> 03:14.120\n The only the first tranche is private\n\n03:14.120 --> 03:16.520\n and then it's public from there.\n\n03:16.520 --> 03:21.520\n And this is probably by far the most popular game in AI\n\n03:24.040 --> 03:26.380\n and just the general public\n\n03:26.380 --> 03:28.400\n in terms of imperfect information.\n\n03:28.400 --> 03:32.520\n So that's probably the most popular spectator game\n\n03:32.520 --> 03:33.400\n to watch, right?\n\n03:33.400 --> 03:37.260\n So, which is why it's a super exciting game to tackle.\n\n03:37.260 --> 03:40.480\n So it's on the order of chess, I would say,\n\n03:40.480 --> 03:43.680\n in terms of popularity, in terms of AI setting it\n\n03:43.680 --> 03:46.360\n as the bar of what is intelligence.\n\n03:46.360 --> 03:50.400\n So in 2017, Labratus, how do you pronounce it?\n\n03:50.400 --> 03:51.220\n Labratus.\n\n03:51.220 --> 03:52.060\n Labratus.\n\n03:52.060 --> 03:52.900\n Labratus beats.\n\n03:52.900 --> 03:54.080\n A little Latin there.\n\n03:54.080 --> 03:55.520\n A little bit of Latin.\n\n03:55.520 --> 04:00.520\n Labratus beats a few, four expert human players.\n\n04:01.040 --> 04:03.080\n Can you describe that event?\n\n04:03.080 --> 04:04.060\n What you learned from it?\n\n04:04.060 --> 04:04.900\n What was it like?\n\n04:04.900 --> 04:06.860\n What was the process in general\n\n04:06.860 --> 04:09.960\n for people who have not read the papers and the study?\n\n04:09.960 --> 04:12.920\n Yeah, so the event was that we invited\n\n04:12.920 --> 04:14.840\n four of the top 10 players,\n\n04:14.840 --> 04:17.080\n with these specialist players in Heads Up No Limit,\n\n04:17.080 --> 04:19.080\n Texas Holden, which is very important\n\n04:19.080 --> 04:21.400\n because this game is actually quite different\n\n04:21.400 --> 04:23.900\n than the multiplayer version.\n\n04:23.900 --> 04:25.680\n We brought them in to Pittsburgh\n\n04:25.680 --> 04:28.920\n to play at the Reverse Casino for 20 days.\n\n04:28.920 --> 04:31.840\n We wanted to get 120,000 hands in\n\n04:31.840 --> 04:36.160\n because we wanted to get statistical significance.\n\n04:36.160 --> 04:39.040\n So it's a lot of hands for humans to play,\n\n04:39.040 --> 04:42.840\n even for these top pros who play fairly quickly normally.\n\n04:42.840 --> 04:46.400\n So we couldn't just have one of them play so many hands.\n\n04:46.400 --> 04:50.400\n 20 days, they were playing basically morning to evening.\n\n04:50.400 --> 04:55.400\n And I raised 200,000 as a little incentive for them to play.\n\n04:55.660 --> 05:00.060\n And the setting was so that they didn't all get 50,000.\n\n05:01.080 --> 05:02.640\n We actually paid them out\n\n05:02.640 --> 05:05.480\n based on how they did against the AI each.\n\n05:05.480 --> 05:09.440\n So they had an incentive to play as hard as they could,\n\n05:09.440 --> 05:11.160\n whether they're way ahead or way behind\n\n05:11.160 --> 05:13.760\n or right at the mark of beating the AI.\n\n05:13.760 --> 05:16.000\n And you don't make any money, unfortunately.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:17.920\n Right, no, we can't make any money.\n\n05:17.920 --> 05:20.320\n So originally, a couple of years earlier,\n\n05:20.320 --> 05:24.080\n I actually explored whether we could actually play for money\n\n05:24.080 --> 05:28.000\n because that would be, of course, interesting as well,\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:29.520\n to play against the top people for money.\n\n05:29.520 --> 05:33.040\n But the Pennsylvania Gaming Board said no, so we couldn't.\n\n05:33.040 --> 05:35.520\n So this is much like an exhibit,\n\n05:36.400 --> 05:39.760\n like for a musician or a boxer or something like that.\n\n05:39.760 --> 05:41.600\n Nevertheless, they were keeping track of the money\n\n05:41.600 --> 05:46.600\n and brought us close to $2 million, I think.\n\n05:48.200 --> 05:51.840\n So if it was for real money, if you were able to earn money,\n\n05:51.840 --> 05:55.360\n that was a quite impressive and inspiring achievement.\n\n05:55.360 --> 05:59.280\n Just a few details, what were the players looking at?\n\n05:59.280 --> 06:00.460\n Were they behind a computer?\n\n06:00.460 --> 06:02.080\n What was the interface like?\n\n06:02.080 --> 06:05.240\n Yes, they were playing much like they normally do.\n\n06:05.240 --> 06:07.200\n These top players, when they play this game,\n\n06:07.200 --> 06:08.680\n they play mostly online.\n\n06:08.680 --> 06:11.640\n So they're used to playing through a UI.\n\n06:11.640 --> 06:13.280\n And they did the same thing here.\n\n06:13.280 --> 06:14.520\n So there was this layout.\n\n06:14.520 --> 06:17.920\n You could imagine there's a table on a screen.\n\n06:17.920 --> 06:20.080\n There's the human sitting there,\n\n06:20.080 --> 06:21.720\n and then there's the AI sitting there.\n\n06:21.720 --> 06:24.560\n And the screen shows everything that's happening.\n\n06:24.560 --> 06:27.480\n The cards coming out and shows the bets being made.\n\n06:27.480 --> 06:29.940\n And we also had the betting history for the human.\n\n06:29.940 --> 06:33.320\n So if the human forgot what had happened in the hand so far,\n\n06:33.320 --> 06:37.240\n they could actually reference back and so forth.\n\n06:37.240 --> 06:39.480\n Is there a reason they were given access\n\n06:39.480 --> 06:41.200\n to the betting history for?\n\n06:41.200 --> 06:45.860\n Well, we just, it didn't really matter.\n\n06:45.860 --> 06:47.360\n They wouldn't have forgotten anyway.\n\n06:47.360 --> 06:48.800\n These are top quality people.\n\n06:48.800 --> 06:51.300\n But we just wanted to put out there\n\n06:51.300 --> 06:53.460\n so it's not a question of the human forgetting\n\n06:53.460 --> 06:55.320\n and the AI somehow trying to get advantage\n\n06:55.320 --> 06:56.760\n of better memory.\n\n06:56.760 --> 06:57.640\n So what was that like?\n\n06:57.640 --> 06:59.720\n I mean, that was an incredible accomplishment.\n\n06:59.720 --> 07:02.760\n So what did it feel like before the event?\n\n07:02.760 --> 07:05.640\n Did you have doubt, hope?\n\n07:05.640 --> 07:08.160\n Where was your confidence at?\n\n07:08.160 --> 07:09.240\n Yeah, that's great.\n\n07:09.240 --> 07:10.160\n So great question.\n\n07:10.160 --> 07:14.200\n So 18 months earlier, I had organized a similar brains\n\n07:14.200 --> 07:17.840\n versus AI competition with a previous AI called Cloudyco\n\n07:17.840 --> 07:20.560\n and we couldn't beat the humans.\n\n07:20.560 --> 07:23.800\n So this time around, it was only 18 months later.\n\n07:23.800 --> 07:27.820\n And I knew that this new AI, Libratus, was way stronger,\n\n07:27.820 --> 07:31.360\n but it's hard to say how you'll do against the top humans\n\n07:31.360 --> 07:32.440\n before you try.\n\n07:32.440 --> 07:35.160\n So I thought we had about a 50, 50 shot.\n\n07:35.160 --> 07:38.880\n And the international betting sites put us\n\n07:38.880 --> 07:41.800\n as a four to one or five to one underdog.\n\n07:41.800 --> 07:44.700\n So it's kind of interesting that people really believe\n\n07:44.700 --> 07:48.440\n in people and over AI, not just people.\n\n07:48.440 --> 07:50.720\n People don't just over believe in themselves,\n\n07:50.720 --> 07:53.280\n but they have overconfidence in other people as well\n\n07:53.280 --> 07:55.440\n compared to the performance of AI.\n\n07:55.440 --> 07:59.120\n And yeah, so we were a four to one or five to one underdog.\n\n07:59.120 --> 08:02.880\n And even after three days of beating the humans in a row,\n\n08:02.880 --> 08:06.520\n we were still 50, 50 on the international betting sites.\n\n08:06.520 --> 08:09.040\n Do you think there's something special and magical\n\n08:09.040 --> 08:12.160\n about poker and the way people think about it,\n\n08:12.160 --> 08:14.600\n in the sense you have,\n\n08:14.600 --> 08:17.320\n I mean, even in chess, there's no Hollywood movies.\n\n08:17.320 --> 08:21.200\n Poker is the star of many movies.\n\n08:21.200 --> 08:26.200\n And there's this feeling that certain human facial\n\n08:26.640 --> 08:30.760\n expressions and body language, eye movement,\n\n08:30.760 --> 08:33.360\n all these tells are critical to poker.\n\n08:33.360 --> 08:35.000\n Like you can look into somebody's soul\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.880\n and understand their betting strategy and so on.\n\n08:37.880 --> 08:41.520\n So that's probably why, possibly,\n\n08:41.520 --> 08:43.640\n do you think that is why people have a confidence\n\n08:43.640 --> 08:45.640\n that humans will outperform?\n\n08:45.640 --> 08:48.920\n Because AI systems cannot, in this construct,\n\n08:48.920 --> 08:51.040\n perceive these kinds of tells.\n\n08:51.040 --> 08:53.200\n They're only looking at betting patterns\n\n08:53.200 --> 08:58.200\n and nothing else, betting patterns and statistics.\n\n08:58.200 --> 09:02.200\n So what's more important to you\n\n09:02.200 --> 09:06.120\n if you step back on human players, human versus human?\n\n09:06.120 --> 09:08.600\n What's the role of these tells,\n\n09:08.600 --> 09:11.880\n of these ideas that we romanticize?\n\n09:11.880 --> 09:15.480\n Yeah, so I'll split it into two parts.\n\n09:15.480 --> 09:20.480\n So one is why do humans trust humans more than AI\n\n09:20.480 --> 09:22.600\n and have overconfidence in humans?\n\n09:22.600 --> 09:25.920\n I think that's not really related to the tell question.\n\n09:25.920 --> 09:28.600\n It's just that they've seen these top players,\n\n09:28.600 --> 09:31.040\n how good they are, and they're really fantastic.\n\n09:31.040 --> 09:36.040\n So it's just hard to believe that an AI could beat them.\n\n09:36.040 --> 09:37.680\n So I think that's where that comes from.\n\n09:37.680 --> 09:40.600\n And that's actually maybe a more general lesson about AI.\n\n09:40.600 --> 09:43.200\n That until you've seen it overperform a human,\n\n09:43.200 --> 09:45.080\n it's hard to believe that it could.\n\n09:45.080 --> 09:50.080\n But then the tells, a lot of these top players,\n\n09:50.560 --> 09:52.760\n they're so good at hiding tells\n\n09:52.760 --> 09:56.240\n that among the top players,\n\n09:56.240 --> 09:59.480\n it's actually not really worth it\n\n09:59.480 --> 10:01.200\n for them to invest a lot of effort\n\n10:01.200 --> 10:03.160\n trying to find tells in each other\n\n10:03.160 --> 10:05.640\n because they're so good at hiding them.\n\n10:05.640 --> 10:09.840\n So yes, at the kind of Friday evening game,\n\n10:09.840 --> 10:11.800\n tells are gonna be a huge thing.\n\n10:11.800 --> 10:13.160\n You can read other people.\n\n10:13.160 --> 10:14.120\n And if you're a good reader,\n\n10:14.120 --> 10:16.440\n you'll read them like an open book.\n\n10:16.440 --> 10:18.280\n But at the top levels of poker now,\n\n10:18.280 --> 10:21.960\n the tells become a much smaller and smaller aspect\n\n10:21.960 --> 10:24.480\n of the game as you go to the top levels.\n\n10:24.480 --> 10:28.120\n The amount of strategies, the amount of possible actions\n\n10:28.120 --> 10:33.120\n is very large, 10 to the power of 100 plus.\n\n10:35.400 --> 10:37.880\n So there has to be some, I've read a few of the papers\n\n10:37.880 --> 10:42.080\n related, it has to form some abstractions\n\n10:42.080 --> 10:44.040\n of various hands and actions.\n\n10:44.040 --> 10:47.560\n So what kind of abstractions are effective\n\n10:47.560 --> 10:49.200\n for the game of poker?\n\n10:49.200 --> 10:50.880\n Yeah, so you're exactly right.\n\n10:50.880 --> 10:55.360\n So when you go from a game tree that's 10 to the 161,\n\n10:55.360 --> 10:58.000\n especially in an imperfect information game,\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.200\n it's way too large to solve directly,\n\n11:00.200 --> 11:03.280\n even with our fastest equilibrium finding algorithms.\n\n11:03.280 --> 11:07.200\n So you wanna abstract it first.\n\n11:07.200 --> 11:10.920\n And abstraction in games is much trickier\n\n11:10.920 --> 11:15.440\n than abstraction in MDPs or other single agent settings.\n\n11:15.440 --> 11:17.760\n Because you have these abstraction pathologies\n\n11:17.760 --> 11:19.880\n that if I have a finer grained abstraction,\n\n11:19.880 --> 11:23.240\n the strategy that I can get from that for the real game\n\n11:23.240 --> 11:25.240\n might actually be worse than the strategy\n\n11:25.240 --> 11:27.160\n I can get from the coarse grained abstraction.\n\n11:27.160 --> 11:28.760\n So you have to be very careful.\n\n11:28.760 --> 11:31.080\n Now the kinds of abstractions, just to zoom out,\n\n11:31.080 --> 11:34.480\n we're talking about, there's the hands abstractions\n\n11:34.480 --> 11:37.280\n and then there's betting strategies.\n\n11:37.280 --> 11:38.600\n Yeah, betting actions, yeah.\n\n11:38.600 --> 11:39.440\n Baiting actions.\n\n11:39.440 --> 11:41.640\n So there's information abstraction,\n\n11:41.640 --> 11:44.720\n don't talk about general games, information abstraction,\n\n11:44.720 --> 11:47.560\n which is the abstraction of what chance does.\n\n11:47.560 --> 11:50.080\n And this would be the cards in the case of poker.\n\n11:50.080 --> 11:52.480\n And then there's action abstraction,\n\n11:52.480 --> 11:57.000\n which is abstracting the actions of the actual players,\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.560\n which would be bets in the case of poker.\n\n11:59.560 --> 12:01.320\n Yourself and the other players?\n\n12:01.320 --> 12:03.680\n Yes, yourself and other players.\n\n12:03.680 --> 12:08.280\n And for information abstraction,\n\n12:08.280 --> 12:11.160\n we were completely automated.\n\n12:11.160 --> 12:13.840\n So these are algorithms,\n\n12:13.840 --> 12:16.760\n but they do what we call potential aware abstraction,\n\n12:16.760 --> 12:19.000\n where we don't just look at the value of the hand,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.840\n but also how it might materialize\n\n12:20.840 --> 12:22.560\n into good or bad hands over time.\n\n12:22.560 --> 12:25.280\n And it's a certain kind of bottom up process\n\n12:25.280 --> 12:27.640\n with integer programming there and clustering\n\n12:27.640 --> 12:31.480\n and various aspects, how do you build this abstraction?\n\n12:31.480 --> 12:34.400\n And then in the action abstraction,\n\n12:34.400 --> 12:39.400\n there it's largely based on how humans and other AIs\n\n12:40.520 --> 12:42.320\n have played this game in the past.\n\n12:42.320 --> 12:43.880\n But in the beginning,\n\n12:43.880 --> 12:47.680\n we actually used an automated action abstraction technology,\n\n12:47.680 --> 12:50.240\n which is provably convergent\n\n12:51.240 --> 12:54.040\n that it finds the optimal combination of bet sizes,\n\n12:54.040 --> 12:55.480\n but it's not very scalable.\n\n12:55.480 --> 12:57.280\n So we couldn't use it for the whole game,\n\n12:57.280 --> 12:59.880\n but we use it for the first couple of betting actions.\n\n12:59.880 --> 13:03.080\n So what's more important, the strength of the hand,\n\n13:03.080 --> 13:08.080\n so the information abstraction or the how you play them,\n\n13:09.320 --> 13:11.640\n the actions, does it, you know,\n\n13:11.640 --> 13:13.200\n the romanticized notion again,\n\n13:13.200 --> 13:15.600\n is that it doesn't matter what hands you have,\n\n13:15.600 --> 13:19.240\n that the actions, the betting may be the way you win\n\n13:19.240 --> 13:20.320\n no matter what hands you have.\n\n13:20.320 --> 13:23.280\n Yeah, so that's why you have to play a lot of hands\n\n13:23.280 --> 13:26.800\n so that the role of luck gets smaller.\n\n13:26.800 --> 13:29.920\n So you could otherwise get lucky and get some good hands\n\n13:29.920 --> 13:31.480\n and then you're gonna win the match.\n\n13:31.480 --> 13:34.400\n Even with thousands of hands, you can get lucky\n\n13:35.280 --> 13:36.720\n because there's so much variance\n\n13:36.720 --> 13:40.880\n in No Limit Texas Holden because if we both go all in,\n\n13:40.880 --> 13:43.640\n it's a huge stack of variance, so there are these\n\n13:43.640 --> 13:47.800\n massive swings in No Limit Texas Holden.\n\n13:47.800 --> 13:50.240\n So that's why you have to play not just thousands,\n\n13:50.240 --> 13:55.000\n but over 100,000 hands to get statistical significance.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.880\n So let me ask another way this question.\n\n13:57.880 --> 14:00.880\n If you didn't even look at your hands,\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.560\n but they didn't know that, the opponents didn't know that,\n\n14:04.560 --> 14:06.680\n how well would you be able to do?\n\n14:06.680 --> 14:07.760\n Oh, that's a good question.\n\n14:07.760 --> 14:09.600\n There's actually, I heard this story\n\n14:09.600 --> 14:11.800\n that there's this Norwegian female poker player\n\n14:11.800 --> 14:15.240\n called Annette Oberstad who's actually won a tournament\n\n14:15.240 --> 14:18.640\n by doing exactly that, but that would be extremely rare.\n\n14:18.640 --> 14:23.440\n So you cannot really play well that way.\n\n14:23.440 --> 14:27.840\n Okay, so the hands do have some role to play, okay.\n\n14:27.840 --> 14:32.840\n So Labradus does not use, as far as I understand,\n\n14:33.120 --> 14:35.320\n they use learning methods, deep learning.\n\n14:35.320 --> 14:40.320\n Is there room for learning in,\n\n14:40.600 --> 14:44.120\n there's no reason why Labradus doesn't combine\n\n14:44.120 --> 14:46.400\n with an AlphaGo type approach for estimating\n\n14:46.400 --> 14:49.200\n the quality for function estimator.\n\n14:49.200 --> 14:52.040\n What are your thoughts on this,\n\n14:52.040 --> 14:54.760\n maybe as compared to another algorithm\n\n14:54.760 --> 14:56.720\n which I'm not that familiar with, DeepStack,\n\n14:56.720 --> 14:59.280\n the engine that does use deep learning,\n\n14:59.280 --> 15:01.560\n that it's unclear how well it does,\n\n15:01.560 --> 15:03.480\n but nevertheless uses deep learning.\n\n15:03.480 --> 15:05.400\n So what are your thoughts about learning methods\n\n15:05.400 --> 15:09.280\n to aid in the way that Labradus plays in the game of poker?\n\n15:09.280 --> 15:10.640\n Yeah, so as you said,\n\n15:10.640 --> 15:13.080\n Labradus did not use learning methods\n\n15:13.080 --> 15:15.680\n and played very well without them.\n\n15:15.680 --> 15:17.840\n Since then, we have actually, actually here,\n\n15:17.840 --> 15:20.000\n we have a couple of papers on things\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.360\n that do use learning techniques.\n\n15:22.360 --> 15:23.200\n Excellent.\n\n15:24.440 --> 15:26.360\n And deep learning in particular.\n\n15:26.360 --> 15:29.920\n And sort of the way you're talking about\n\n15:29.920 --> 15:33.360\n where it's learning an evaluation function,\n\n15:33.360 --> 15:37.400\n but in imperfect information games,\n\n15:37.400 --> 15:42.400\n unlike let's say in Go or now also in chess and shogi,\n\n15:42.440 --> 15:47.400\n it's not sufficient to learn an evaluation for a state\n\n15:47.400 --> 15:52.400\n because the value of an information set\n\n15:52.920 --> 15:55.400\n depends not only on the exact state,\n\n15:55.400 --> 15:59.200\n but it also depends on both players beliefs.\n\n15:59.200 --> 16:01.240\n Like if I have a bad hand,\n\n16:01.240 --> 16:04.720\n I'm much better off if the opponent thinks I have a good hand\n\n16:04.720 --> 16:05.560\n and vice versa.\n\n16:05.560 --> 16:06.480\n If I have a good hand,\n\n16:06.480 --> 16:09.360\n I'm much better off if the opponent believes\n\n16:09.360 --> 16:10.280\n I have a bad hand.\n\n16:11.360 --> 16:15.640\n So the value of a state is not just a function of the cards.\n\n16:15.640 --> 16:19.600\n It depends on, if you will, the path of play,\n\n16:19.600 --> 16:22.040\n but only to the extent that it's captured\n\n16:22.040 --> 16:23.720\n in the belief distributions.\n\n16:23.720 --> 16:26.240\n So that's why it's not as simple\n\n16:26.240 --> 16:29.320\n as it is in perfect information games.\n\n16:29.320 --> 16:31.080\n And I don't wanna say it's simple there either.\n\n16:31.080 --> 16:34.200\n It's of course very complicated computationally there too,\n\n16:34.200 --> 16:36.520\n but at least conceptually, it's very straightforward.\n\n16:36.520 --> 16:38.760\n There's a state, there's an evaluation function.\n\n16:38.760 --> 16:39.800\n You can try to learn it.\n\n16:39.800 --> 16:43.280\n Here, you have to do something more.\n\n16:43.280 --> 16:47.160\n And what we do is in one of these papers,\n\n16:47.160 --> 16:50.800\n we're looking at where we allow the opponent\n\n16:50.800 --> 16:53.000\n to actually take different strategies\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:56.440\n at the leaf of the search tree, if you will.\n\n16:56.440 --> 16:59.840\n And that is a different way of doing it.\n\n16:59.840 --> 17:02.560\n And it doesn't assume therefore a particular way\n\n17:02.560 --> 17:04.040\n that the opponent plays,\n\n17:04.040 --> 17:05.840\n but it allows the opponent to choose\n\n17:05.840 --> 17:09.800\n from a set of different continuation strategies.\n\n17:09.800 --> 17:13.400\n And that forces us to not be too optimistic\n\n17:13.400 --> 17:15.520\n in a look ahead search.\n\n17:15.520 --> 17:19.040\n And that's one way you can do sound look ahead search\n\n17:19.040 --> 17:21.480\n in imperfect information games,\n\n17:21.480 --> 17:23.360\n which is very difficult.\n\n17:23.360 --> 17:26.080\n And you were asking about DeepStack.\n\n17:26.080 --> 17:29.280\n What they did, it was very different than what we do,\n\n17:29.280 --> 17:32.000\n either in Libratus or in this new work.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:35.440\n They were randomly generating various situations\n\n17:35.440 --> 17:36.440\n in the game.\n\n17:36.440 --> 17:38.080\n Then they were doing the look ahead\n\n17:38.080 --> 17:39.840\n from there to the end of the game,\n\n17:39.840 --> 17:42.960\n as if that was the start of a different game.\n\n17:42.960 --> 17:44.920\n And then they were using deep learning\n\n17:44.920 --> 17:47.960\n to learn those values of those states,\n\n17:47.960 --> 17:50.280\n but the states were not just the physical states.\n\n17:50.280 --> 17:52.560\n They include belief distributions.\n\n17:52.560 --> 17:56.800\n When you talk about look ahead for DeepStack\n\n17:56.800 --> 17:59.480\n or with Libratus, does it mean,\n\n17:59.480 --> 18:02.680\n considering every possibility that the game can evolve,\n\n18:02.680 --> 18:04.280\n are we talking about extremely,\n\n18:04.280 --> 18:06.880\n sort of this exponentially growth of a tree?\n\n18:06.880 --> 18:09.720\n Yes, so we're talking about exactly that.\n\n18:11.280 --> 18:14.280\n Much like you do in alpha beta search\n\n18:14.280 --> 18:17.480\n or Monte Carlo tree search, but with different techniques.\n\n18:17.480 --> 18:19.280\n So there's a different search algorithm.\n\n18:19.280 --> 18:21.920\n And then we have to deal with the leaves differently.\n\n18:21.920 --> 18:24.000\n So if you think about what Libratus did,\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.520\n we didn't have to worry about this\n\n18:25.520 --> 18:28.560\n because we only did it at the end of the game.\n\n18:28.560 --> 18:32.280\n So we would always terminate into a real situation\n\n18:32.280 --> 18:34.000\n and we would know what the payout is.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.880\n It didn't do these depth limited lookaheads,\n\n18:36.880 --> 18:40.680\n but now in this new paper, which is called depth limited,\n\n18:40.680 --> 18:42.120\n I think it's called depth limited search\n\n18:42.120 --> 18:43.880\n for imperfect information games,\n\n18:43.880 --> 18:47.040\n we can actually do sound depth limited lookahead.\n\n18:47.040 --> 18:49.240\n So we can actually start to do the look ahead\n\n18:49.240 --> 18:51.080\n from the beginning of the game on,\n\n18:51.080 --> 18:53.400\n because that's too complicated to do\n\n18:53.400 --> 18:54.920\n for this whole long game.\n\n18:54.920 --> 18:57.680\n So in Libratus, we were just doing it for the end.\n\n18:57.680 --> 19:00.720\n So, and then the other side, this belief distribution,\n\n19:00.720 --> 19:05.320\n so is it explicitly modeled what kind of beliefs\n\n19:05.320 --> 19:07.400\n that the opponent might have?\n\n19:07.400 --> 19:11.840\n Yeah, it is explicitly modeled, but it's not assumed.\n\n19:11.840 --> 19:15.400\n The beliefs are actually output, not input.\n\n19:15.400 --> 19:18.840\n Of course, the starting beliefs are input,\n\n19:18.840 --> 19:20.640\n but they just fall from the rules of the game\n\n19:20.640 --> 19:23.520\n because we know that the dealer deals uniformly\n\n19:23.520 --> 19:27.720\n from the deck, so I know that every pair of cards\n\n19:27.720 --> 19:30.440\n that you might have is equally likely.\n\n19:30.440 --> 19:32.200\n I know that for a fact, that just follows\n\n19:32.200 --> 19:33.160\n from the rules of the game.\n\n19:33.160 --> 19:35.200\n Of course, except the two cards that I have,\n\n19:35.200 --> 19:36.560\n I know you don't have those.\n\n19:36.560 --> 19:37.560\n Yeah.\n\n19:37.560 --> 19:38.720\n You have to take that into account.\n\n19:38.720 --> 19:40.920\n That's called card removal and that's very important.\n\n19:40.920 --> 19:43.760\n Is the dealing always coming from a single deck\n\n19:43.760 --> 19:45.880\n in Heads Up, so you can assume.\n\n19:45.880 --> 19:50.880\n Single deck, so you know that if I have the ace of spades,\n\n19:50.880 --> 19:53.560\n I know you don't have an ace of spades.\n\n19:53.560 --> 19:56.880\n Great, so in the beginning, your belief is basically\n\n19:56.880 --> 19:59.320\n the fact that it's a fair dealing of hands,\n\n19:59.320 --> 20:02.800\n but how do you start to adjust that belief?\n\n20:02.800 --> 20:06.800\n Well, that's where this beauty of game theory comes.\n\n20:06.800 --> 20:10.920\n So Nash equilibrium, which John Nash introduced in 1950,\n\n20:10.920 --> 20:13.800\n introduces what rational play is\n\n20:13.800 --> 20:16.040\n when you have more than one player.\n\n20:16.040 --> 20:18.440\n And these are pairs of strategies\n\n20:18.440 --> 20:20.360\n where strategies are contingency plans,\n\n20:20.360 --> 20:21.600\n one for each player.\n\n20:22.880 --> 20:25.720\n So that neither player wants to deviate\n\n20:25.720 --> 20:26.960\n to a different strategy,\n\n20:26.960 --> 20:29.160\n given that the other doesn't deviate.\n\n20:29.160 --> 20:33.840\n But as a side effect, you get the beliefs from base roll.\n\n20:33.840 --> 20:36.440\n So Nash equilibrium really isn't just deriving\n\n20:36.440 --> 20:38.360\n in these imperfect information games,\n\n20:38.360 --> 20:41.920\n Nash equilibrium, it doesn't just define strategies.\n\n20:41.920 --> 20:44.960\n It also defines beliefs for both of us\n\n20:44.960 --> 20:48.840\n and defines beliefs for each state.\n\n20:48.840 --> 20:53.280\n So at each state, it's called information sets.\n\n20:53.280 --> 20:55.560\n At each information set in the game,\n\n20:55.560 --> 20:59.000\n there's a set of different states that we might be in,\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.880\n but I don't know which one we're in.\n\n21:01.760 --> 21:03.400\n Nash equilibrium tells me exactly\n\n21:03.400 --> 21:05.000\n what is the probability distribution\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:08.280\n over those real world states in my mind.\n\n21:08.280 --> 21:11.440\n How does Nash equilibrium give you that distribution?\n\n21:11.440 --> 21:12.280\n So why?\n\n21:12.280 --> 21:13.320\n I'll do a simple example.\n\n21:13.320 --> 21:16.760\n So you know the game Rock, Paper, Scissors?\n\n21:16.760 --> 21:20.000\n So we can draw it as player one moves first\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:21.600\n and then player two moves.\n\n21:21.600 --> 21:24.520\n But of course, it's important that player two\n\n21:24.520 --> 21:26.400\n doesn't know what player one moved,\n\n21:26.400 --> 21:28.600\n otherwise player two would win every time.\n\n21:28.600 --> 21:30.480\n So we can draw that as an information set\n\n21:30.480 --> 21:33.280\n where player one makes one of three moves first,\n\n21:33.280 --> 21:36.200\n and then there's an information set for player two.\n\n21:36.200 --> 21:39.920\n So player two doesn't know which of those nodes\n\n21:39.920 --> 21:41.800\n the world is in.\n\n21:41.800 --> 21:44.920\n But once we know the strategy for player one,\n\n21:44.920 --> 21:47.320\n Nash equilibrium will say that you play 1 3rd Rock,\n\n21:47.320 --> 21:49.400\n 1 3rd Paper, 1 3rd Scissors.\n\n21:49.400 --> 21:52.600\n From that, I can derive my beliefs on the information set\n\n21:52.600 --> 21:54.480\n that they're 1 3rd, 1 3rd, 1 3rd.\n\n21:54.480 --> 21:56.280\n So Bayes gives you that.\n\n21:56.280 --> 21:57.560\n Bayes gives you.\n\n21:57.560 --> 21:59.760\n But is that specific to a particular player,\n\n21:59.760 --> 22:03.960\n or is it something you quickly update\n\n22:03.960 --> 22:05.040\n with the specific player?\n\n22:05.040 --> 22:08.800\n No, the game theory isn't really player specific.\n\n22:08.800 --> 22:11.720\n So that's also why we don't need any data.\n\n22:11.720 --> 22:12.760\n We don't need any history\n\n22:12.760 --> 22:14.800\n how these particular humans played in the past\n\n22:14.800 --> 22:17.400\n or how any AI or human had played before.\n\n22:17.400 --> 22:20.240\n It's all about rationality.\n\n22:20.240 --> 22:22.720\n So the AI just thinks about\n\n22:22.720 --> 22:24.880\n what would a rational opponent do?\n\n22:24.880 --> 22:28.000\n And what would I do if I am rational?\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:31.080\n And that's the idea of game theory.\n\n22:31.080 --> 22:35.560\n So it's really a data free, opponent free approach.\n\n22:35.560 --> 22:37.680\n So it comes from the design of the game\n\n22:37.680 --> 22:40.040\n as opposed to the design of the player.\n\n22:40.040 --> 22:43.080\n Exactly, there's no opponent modeling per se.\n\n22:43.080 --> 22:45.600\n I mean, we've done some work on combining opponent modeling\n\n22:45.600 --> 22:48.840\n with game theory so you can exploit weak players even more,\n\n22:48.840 --> 22:50.280\n but that's another strand.\n\n22:50.280 --> 22:52.320\n And in Librarus, we didn't turn that on.\n\n22:52.320 --> 22:55.000\n So I decided that these players are too good.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:58.080\n And when you start to exploit an opponent,\n\n22:58.080 --> 23:01.800\n you typically open yourself up to exploitation.\n\n23:01.800 --> 23:04.000\n And these guys have so few holes to exploit\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.760\n and they're world's leading experts in counter exploitation.\n\n23:06.760 --> 23:09.200\n So I decided that we're not gonna turn that stuff on.\n\n23:09.200 --> 23:12.160\n Actually, I saw a few of your papers exploiting opponents.\n\n23:12.160 --> 23:14.800\n It sounded very interesting to explore.\n\n23:15.720 --> 23:17.880\n Do you think there's room for exploitation\n\n23:17.880 --> 23:19.920\n generally outside of Librarus?\n\n23:19.920 --> 23:24.080\n Is there a subject or people differences\n\n23:24.080 --> 23:27.920\n that could be exploited, maybe not just in poker,\n\n23:27.920 --> 23:30.440\n but in general interactions and negotiations,\n\n23:30.440 --> 23:33.480\n all these other domains that you're considering?\n\n23:33.480 --> 23:34.680\n Yeah, definitely.\n\n23:34.680 --> 23:35.920\n We've done some work on that.\n\n23:35.920 --> 23:39.880\n And I really like the work at hybrid digested too.\n\n23:39.880 --> 23:43.440\n So you figure out what would a rational opponent do.\n\n23:43.440 --> 23:46.280\n And by the way, that's safe in these zero sum games,\n\n23:46.280 --> 23:47.480\n two player zero sum games,\n\n23:47.480 --> 23:49.560\n because if the opponent does something irrational,\n\n23:49.560 --> 23:52.200\n yes, it might throw off my beliefs,\n\n23:53.080 --> 23:55.760\n but the amount that the player can gain\n\n23:55.760 --> 23:59.160\n by throwing off my belief is always less\n\n23:59.160 --> 24:01.800\n than they lose by playing poorly.\n\n24:01.800 --> 24:03.080\n So it's safe.\n\n24:03.080 --> 24:06.720\n But still, if somebody's weak as a player,\n\n24:06.720 --> 24:10.240\n you might wanna play differently to exploit them more.\n\n24:10.240 --> 24:12.040\n So you can think about it this way,\n\n24:12.040 --> 24:15.600\n a game theoretic strategy is unbeatable,\n\n24:15.600 --> 24:19.600\n but it doesn't maximally beat the other opponent.\n\n24:19.600 --> 24:22.800\n So the winnings per hand might be better\n\n24:22.800 --> 24:24.240\n with a different strategy.\n\n24:24.240 --> 24:25.720\n And the hybrid is that you start\n\n24:25.720 --> 24:27.080\n from a game theoretic approach.\n\n24:27.080 --> 24:30.840\n And then as you gain data about the opponent\n\n24:30.840 --> 24:32.600\n in certain parts of the game tree,\n\n24:32.600 --> 24:34.360\n then in those parts of the game tree,\n\n24:34.360 --> 24:37.800\n you start to tweak your strategy more and more\n\n24:37.800 --> 24:40.960\n towards exploitation while still staying fairly close\n\n24:40.960 --> 24:42.160\n to the game theoretic strategy\n\n24:42.160 --> 24:46.840\n so as to not open yourself up to exploitation too much.\n\n24:46.840 --> 24:48.320\n How do you do that?\n\n24:48.320 --> 24:53.320\n Do you try to vary up strategies, make it unpredictable?\n\n24:53.640 --> 24:57.520\n It's like, what is it, tit for tat strategies\n\n24:57.520 --> 25:00.720\n in Prisoner's Dilemma or?\n\n25:00.720 --> 25:03.240\n Well, that's a repeated game.\n\n25:03.240 --> 25:04.080\n Repeated games.\n\n25:04.080 --> 25:06.520\n Simple Prisoner's Dilemma, repeated games.\n\n25:06.520 --> 25:08.760\n But even there, there's no proof that says\n\n25:08.760 --> 25:10.080\n that that's the best thing.\n\n25:10.080 --> 25:13.280\n But experimentally, it actually does well.\n\n25:13.280 --> 25:15.320\n So what kind of games are there, first of all?\n\n25:15.320 --> 25:17.040\n I don't know if this is something\n\n25:17.040 --> 25:18.600\n that you could just summarize.\n\n25:18.600 --> 25:20.360\n There's perfect information games\n\n25:20.360 --> 25:22.400\n where all the information's on the table.\n\n25:22.400 --> 25:25.480\n There is imperfect information games.\n\n25:25.480 --> 25:28.560\n There's repeated games that you play over and over.\n\n25:28.560 --> 25:31.320\n There's zero sum games.\n\n25:31.320 --> 25:34.440\n There's non zero sum games.\n\n25:34.440 --> 25:37.520\n And then there's a really important distinction\n\n25:37.520 --> 25:40.720\n you're making, two player versus more players.\n\n25:40.720 --> 25:44.760\n So what are, what other games are there?\n\n25:44.760 --> 25:46.160\n And what's the difference, for example,\n\n25:46.160 --> 25:50.040\n with this two player game versus more players?\n\n25:50.040 --> 25:51.680\n What are the key differences in your view?\n\n25:51.680 --> 25:54.600\n So let me start from the basics.\n\n25:54.600 --> 25:59.600\n So a repeated game is a game where the same exact game\n\n25:59.600 --> 26:01.800\n is played over and over.\n\n26:01.800 --> 26:05.800\n In these extensive form games, where it's,\n\n26:05.800 --> 26:08.480\n think about three form, maybe with these information sets\n\n26:08.480 --> 26:11.400\n to represent incomplete information,\n\n26:11.400 --> 26:14.840\n you can have kind of repetitive interactions.\n\n26:14.840 --> 26:17.760\n Even repeated games are a special case of that, by the way.\n\n26:17.760 --> 26:21.520\n But the game doesn't have to be exactly the same.\n\n26:21.520 --> 26:23.040\n It's like in sourcing auctions.\n\n26:23.040 --> 26:26.320\n Yes, we're gonna see the same supply base year to year,\n\n26:26.320 --> 26:28.800\n but what I'm buying is a little different every time.\n\n26:28.800 --> 26:31.000\n And the supply base is a little different every time\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:31.840\n and so on.\n\n26:31.840 --> 26:33.400\n So it's not really repeated.\n\n26:33.400 --> 26:35.680\n So to find a purely repeated game\n\n26:35.680 --> 26:37.840\n is actually very rare in the world.\n\n26:37.840 --> 26:42.840\n So they're really a very course model of what's going on.\n\n26:42.840 --> 26:46.360\n Then if you move up from just repeated,\n\n26:46.360 --> 26:49.040\n simple repeated matrix games,\n\n26:49.040 --> 26:50.800\n not all the way to extensive form games,\n\n26:50.800 --> 26:53.600\n but in between, they're stochastic games,\n\n26:53.600 --> 26:57.000\n where, you know, there's these,\n\n26:57.000 --> 27:00.520\n you think about it like these little matrix games.\n\n27:00.520 --> 27:04.200\n And when you take an action and your opponent takes an action,\n\n27:04.200 --> 27:07.680\n they determine not which next state I'm going to,\n\n27:07.680 --> 27:09.120\n next game I'm going to,\n\n27:09.120 --> 27:11.440\n but the distribution over next games\n\n27:11.440 --> 27:13.360\n where I might be going to.\n\n27:13.360 --> 27:15.360\n So that's the stochastic game.\n\n27:15.360 --> 27:19.000\n But it's like matrix games, repeated stochastic games,\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:20.400\n extensive form games.\n\n27:20.400 --> 27:23.040\n That is from less to more general.\n\n27:23.040 --> 27:26.280\n And poker is an example of the last one.\n\n27:26.280 --> 27:28.400\n So it's really in the most general setting.\n\n27:29.560 --> 27:30.640\n Extensive form games.\n\n27:30.640 --> 27:34.520\n And that's kind of what the AI community has been working on\n\n27:34.520 --> 27:36.280\n and being benchmarked on\n\n27:36.280 --> 27:38.040\n with this Heads Up No Limit Texas Holdem.\n\n27:38.040 --> 27:39.760\n Can you describe extensive form games?\n\n27:39.760 --> 27:41.560\n What's the model here?\n\n27:41.560 --> 27:44.320\n Yeah, so if you're familiar with the tree form,\n\n27:44.320 --> 27:45.760\n so it's really the tree form.\n\n27:45.760 --> 27:47.560\n Like in chess, there's a search tree.\n\n27:47.560 --> 27:48.720\n Versus a matrix.\n\n27:48.720 --> 27:50.080\n Versus a matrix, yeah.\n\n27:50.080 --> 27:53.000\n And the matrix is called the matrix form\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.320\n or bi matrix form or normal form game.\n\n27:55.320 --> 27:57.080\n And here you have the tree form.\n\n27:57.080 --> 28:00.000\n So you can actually do certain types of reasoning there\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:04.680\n that you lose the information when you go to normal form.\n\n28:04.680 --> 28:07.000\n There's a certain form of equivalence.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:08.880\n Like if you go from tree form and you say it,\n\n28:08.880 --> 28:12.720\n every possible contingency plan is a strategy.\n\n28:12.720 --> 28:15.080\n Then I can actually go back to the normal form,\n\n28:15.080 --> 28:18.600\n but I lose some information from the lack of sequentiality.\n\n28:18.600 --> 28:21.280\n Then the multiplayer versus two player distinction\n\n28:21.280 --> 28:22.880\n is an important one.\n\n28:22.880 --> 28:27.320\n So two player games in zero sum\n\n28:27.320 --> 28:32.320\n are conceptually easier and computationally easier.\n\n28:32.840 --> 28:36.000\n They're still huge like this one,\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:39.680\n but they're conceptually easier and computationally easier\n\n28:39.680 --> 28:42.920\n in that conceptually, you don't have to worry about\n\n28:42.920 --> 28:45.360\n which equilibrium is the other guy going to play\n\n28:45.360 --> 28:46.640\n when there are multiple,\n\n28:46.640 --> 28:49.920\n because any equilibrium strategy is a best response\n\n28:49.920 --> 28:52.000\n to any other equilibrium strategy.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.360\n So I can play a different equilibrium from you\n\n28:54.360 --> 28:57.320\n and we'll still get the right values of the game.\n\n28:57.320 --> 28:59.240\n That falls apart even with two players\n\n28:59.240 --> 29:01.360\n when you have general sum games.\n\n29:01.360 --> 29:03.120\n Even without cooperation just in general.\n\n29:03.120 --> 29:04.800\n Even without cooperation.\n\n29:04.800 --> 29:07.640\n So there's a big gap from two player zero sum\n\n29:07.640 --> 29:11.160\n to two player general sum or even to three player zero sum.\n\n29:11.160 --> 29:14.280\n That's a big gap, at least in theory.\n\n29:14.280 --> 29:18.920\n Can you maybe non mathematically provide the intuition\n\n29:18.920 --> 29:22.120\n why it all falls apart with three or more players?\n\n29:22.120 --> 29:24.400\n It seems like you should still be able to have\n\n29:24.400 --> 29:29.400\n a Nash equilibrium that's instructive, that holds.\n\n29:31.280 --> 29:36.000\n Okay, so it is true that all finite games\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.200\n have a Nash equilibrium.\n\n29:38.200 --> 29:41.080\n So this is what John Nash actually proved.\n\n29:41.080 --> 29:42.920\n So they do have a Nash equilibrium.\n\n29:42.920 --> 29:43.840\n That's not the problem.\n\n29:43.840 --> 29:46.600\n The problem is that there can be many.\n\n29:46.600 --> 29:50.400\n And then there's a question of which equilibrium to select.\n\n29:50.400 --> 29:52.200\n So, and if you select your strategy\n\n29:52.200 --> 29:54.640\n from a different equilibrium and I select mine,\n\n29:57.920 --> 29:59.920\n then what does that mean?\n\n29:59.920 --> 30:02.080\n And in these non zero sum games,\n\n30:02.080 --> 30:05.720\n we may lose some joint benefit\n\n30:05.720 --> 30:07.040\n by being just simply stupid.\n\n30:07.040 --> 30:08.400\n We could actually both be better off\n\n30:08.400 --> 30:09.920\n if we did something else.\n\n30:09.920 --> 30:11.760\n And in three player, you get other problems\n\n30:11.760 --> 30:13.200\n also like collusion.\n\n30:13.200 --> 30:16.560\n Like maybe you and I can gang up on a third player\n\n30:16.560 --> 30:19.800\n and we can do radically better by colluding.\n\n30:19.800 --> 30:22.200\n So there are lots of issues that come up there.\n\n30:22.200 --> 30:25.640\n So Noah Brown, the student you work with on this\n\n30:25.640 --> 30:29.360\n has mentioned, I looked through the AMA on Reddit.\n\n30:29.360 --> 30:31.280\n He mentioned that the ability of poker players\n\n30:31.280 --> 30:33.800\n to collaborate will make the game.\n\n30:33.800 --> 30:35.200\n He was asked the question of,\n\n30:35.200 --> 30:37.920\n how would you make the game of poker,\n\n30:37.920 --> 30:39.280\n or both of you were asked the question,\n\n30:39.280 --> 30:41.560\n how would you make the game of poker\n\n30:41.560 --> 30:46.560\n beyond being solvable by current AI methods?\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:50.560\n And he said that there's not many ways\n\n30:50.560 --> 30:53.120\n of making poker more difficult,\n\n30:53.120 --> 30:57.760\n but a collaboration or cooperation between players\n\n30:57.760 --> 30:59.760\n would make it extremely difficult.\n\n30:59.760 --> 31:03.320\n So can you provide the intuition behind why that is,\n\n31:03.320 --> 31:05.280\n if you agree with that idea?\n\n31:05.280 --> 31:10.200\n Yeah, so I've done a lot of work on coalitional games\n\n31:10.200 --> 31:11.680\n and we actually have a paper here\n\n31:11.680 --> 31:13.680\n with my other student Gabriele Farina\n\n31:13.680 --> 31:16.640\n and some other collaborators at NIPS on that.\n\n31:16.640 --> 31:18.520\n Actually just came back from the poster session\n\n31:18.520 --> 31:19.760\n where we presented this.\n\n31:19.760 --> 31:23.800\n But so when you have a collusion, it's a different problem.\n\n31:23.800 --> 31:26.120\n And it typically gets even harder then.\n\n31:27.520 --> 31:29.600\n Even the game representations,\n\n31:29.600 --> 31:32.320\n some of the game representations don't really allow\n\n31:33.600 --> 31:34.480\n good computation.\n\n31:34.480 --> 31:37.600\n So we actually introduced a new game representation\n\n31:37.600 --> 31:38.720\n for that.\n\n31:38.720 --> 31:42.040\n Is that kind of cooperation part of the model?\n\n31:42.040 --> 31:44.560\n Are you, do you have, do you have information\n\n31:44.560 --> 31:47.040\n about the fact that other players are cooperating\n\n31:47.040 --> 31:50.000\n or is it just this chaos that where nothing is known?\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.360\n So there's some things unknown.\n\n31:52.360 --> 31:55.840\n Can you give an example of a collusion type game\n\n31:55.840 --> 31:56.680\n or is it usually?\n\n31:56.680 --> 31:58.360\n So like bridge.\n\n31:58.360 --> 31:59.640\n So think about bridge.\n\n31:59.640 --> 32:02.320\n It's like when you and I are on a team,\n\n32:02.320 --> 32:04.480\n our payoffs are the same.\n\n32:04.480 --> 32:06.400\n The problem is that we can't talk.\n\n32:06.400 --> 32:09.000\n So when I get my cards, I can't whisper to you\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:10.320\n what my cards are.\n\n32:10.320 --> 32:12.480\n That would not be allowed.\n\n32:12.480 --> 32:16.080\n So we have to somehow coordinate our strategies\n\n32:16.080 --> 32:19.920\n ahead of time and only ahead of time.\n\n32:19.920 --> 32:22.760\n And then there's certain signals we can talk about,\n\n32:22.760 --> 32:25.240\n but they have to be such that the other team\n\n32:25.240 --> 32:26.840\n also understands them.\n\n32:26.840 --> 32:30.440\n So that's an example where the coordination\n\n32:30.440 --> 32:33.000\n is already built into the rules of the game.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.640\n But in many other situations like auctions\n\n32:35.640 --> 32:40.640\n or negotiations or diplomatic relationships, poker,\n\n32:40.880 --> 32:44.160\n it's not really built in, but it still can be very helpful\n\n32:44.160 --> 32:45.280\n for the colluders.\n\n32:45.280 --> 32:48.240\n I've read you write somewhere,\n\n32:48.240 --> 32:52.800\n the negotiations you come to the table with prior,\n\n32:52.800 --> 32:56.080\n like a strategy that you're willing to do\n\n32:56.080 --> 32:58.320\n and not willing to do those kinds of things.\n\n32:58.320 --> 33:01.960\n So how do you start to now moving away from poker,\n\n33:01.960 --> 33:04.520\n moving beyond poker into other applications\n\n33:04.520 --> 33:07.000\n like negotiations, how do you start applying this\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:11.640\n to other domains, even real world domains\n\n33:11.640 --> 33:12.520\n that you've worked on?\n\n33:12.520 --> 33:14.440\n Yeah, I actually have two startup companies\n\n33:14.440 --> 33:15.480\n doing exactly that.\n\n33:15.480 --> 33:17.800\n One is called Strategic Machine,\n\n33:17.800 --> 33:20.000\n and that's for kind of business applications,\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.880\n gaming, sports, all sorts of things like that.\n\n33:22.880 --> 33:27.200\n Any applications of this to business and to sports\n\n33:27.200 --> 33:32.120\n and to gaming, to various types of things\n\n33:32.120 --> 33:34.240\n in finance, electricity markets and so on.\n\n33:34.240 --> 33:36.600\n And the other is called Strategy Robot,\n\n33:36.600 --> 33:40.640\n where we are taking these to military security,\n\n33:40.640 --> 33:43.520\n cyber security and intelligence applications.\n\n33:43.520 --> 33:46.240\n I think you worked a little bit in,\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:51.000\n how do you put it, advertisement,\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:55.360\n sort of suggesting ads kind of thing, auction.\n\n33:55.360 --> 33:57.800\n That's another company, optimized markets.\n\n33:57.800 --> 34:00.880\n But that's much more about a combinatorial market\n\n34:00.880 --> 34:02.840\n and optimization based technology.\n\n34:02.840 --> 34:06.840\n That's not using these game theoretic reasoning technologies.\n\n34:06.840 --> 34:11.600\n I see, okay, so what sort of high level\n\n34:11.600 --> 34:15.280\n do you think about our ability to use\n\n34:15.280 --> 34:18.040\n game theoretic concepts to model human behavior?\n\n34:18.040 --> 34:21.640\n Do you think human behavior is amenable\n\n34:21.640 --> 34:24.720\n to this kind of modeling outside of the poker games,\n\n34:24.720 --> 34:27.520\n and where have you seen it done successfully in your work?\n\n34:27.520 --> 34:32.520\n I'm not sure the goal really is modeling humans.\n\n34:33.640 --> 34:36.480\n Like for example, if I'm playing a zero sum game,\n\n34:36.480 --> 34:39.840\n I don't really care that the opponent\n\n34:39.840 --> 34:42.960\n is actually following my model of rational behavior,\n\n34:42.960 --> 34:46.400\n because if they're not, that's even better for me.\n\n34:46.400 --> 34:50.200\n Right, so see with the opponents in games,\n\n34:51.120 --> 34:56.120\n the prerequisite is that you formalize\n\n34:56.120 --> 34:57.800\n the interaction in some way\n\n34:57.800 --> 35:01.000\n that can be amenable to analysis.\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:04.160\n And you've done this amazing work with mechanism design,\n\n35:04.160 --> 35:08.160\n designing games that have certain outcomes.\n\n35:10.040 --> 35:12.320\n But, so I'll tell you an example\n\n35:12.320 --> 35:15.460\n from my world of autonomous vehicles, right?\n\n35:15.460 --> 35:17.040\n We're studying pedestrians,\n\n35:17.040 --> 35:20.200\n and pedestrians and cars negotiate\n\n35:20.200 --> 35:22.160\n in this nonverbal communication.\n\n35:22.160 --> 35:25.040\n There's this weird game dance of tension\n\n35:25.040 --> 35:27.280\n where pedestrians are basically saying,\n\n35:27.280 --> 35:28.800\n I trust that you won't kill me,\n\n35:28.800 --> 35:31.840\n and so as a jaywalker, I will step onto the road\n\n35:31.840 --> 35:34.720\n even though I'm breaking the law, and there's this tension.\n\n35:34.720 --> 35:36.640\n And the question is, we really don't know\n\n35:36.640 --> 35:40.720\n how to model that well in trying to model intent.\n\n35:40.720 --> 35:43.080\n And so people sometimes bring up ideas\n\n35:43.080 --> 35:44.880\n of game theory and so on.\n\n35:44.880 --> 35:49.120\n Do you think that aspect of human behavior\n\n35:49.120 --> 35:53.080\n can use these kinds of imperfect information approaches,\n\n35:53.080 --> 35:57.860\n modeling, how do you start to attack a problem like that\n\n35:57.860 --> 36:00.940\n when you don't even know how to design the game\n\n36:00.940 --> 36:04.280\n to describe the situation in order to solve it?\n\n36:04.280 --> 36:06.800\n Okay, so I haven't really thought about jaywalking,\n\n36:06.800 --> 36:10.120\n but one thing that I think could be a good application\n\n36:10.120 --> 36:13.000\n in autonomous vehicles is the following.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:16.320\n So let's say that you have fleets of autonomous cars\n\n36:16.320 --> 36:18.340\n operating by different companies.\n\n36:18.340 --> 36:22.120\n So maybe here's the Waymo fleet and here's the Uber fleet.\n\n36:22.120 --> 36:24.320\n If you think about the rules of the road,\n\n36:24.320 --> 36:26.560\n they define certain legal rules,\n\n36:26.560 --> 36:30.080\n but that still leaves a huge strategy space open.\n\n36:30.080 --> 36:32.840\n Like as a simple example, when cars merge,\n\n36:32.840 --> 36:36.000\n how humans merge, they slow down and look at each other\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:39.240\n and try to merge.\n\n36:39.240 --> 36:40.920\n Wouldn't it be better if these situations\n\n36:40.920 --> 36:43.480\n would already be prenegotiated\n\n36:43.480 --> 36:45.200\n so we can actually merge at full speed\n\n36:45.200 --> 36:47.440\n and we know that this is the situation,\n\n36:47.440 --> 36:50.540\n this is how we do it, and it's all gonna be faster.\n\n36:50.540 --> 36:54.120\n But there are way too many situations to negotiate manually.\n\n36:54.120 --> 36:56.400\n So you could use automated negotiation,\n\n36:56.400 --> 36:57.780\n this is the idea at least,\n\n36:57.780 --> 36:59.840\n you could use automated negotiation\n\n36:59.840 --> 37:02.060\n to negotiate all of these situations\n\n37:02.060 --> 37:04.320\n or many of them in advance.\n\n37:04.320 --> 37:05.460\n And of course it might be that,\n\n37:05.460 --> 37:09.180\n hey, maybe you're not gonna always let me go first.\n\n37:09.180 --> 37:11.280\n Maybe you said, okay, well, in these situations,\n\n37:11.280 --> 37:13.560\n I'll let you go first, but in exchange,\n\n37:13.560 --> 37:14.520\n you're gonna give me too much,\n\n37:14.520 --> 37:17.260\n you're gonna let me go first in this situation.\n\n37:17.260 --> 37:20.680\n So it's this huge combinatorial negotiation.\n\n37:20.680 --> 37:24.080\n And do you think there's room in that example of merging\n\n37:24.080 --> 37:25.600\n to model this whole situation\n\n37:25.600 --> 37:27.160\n as an imperfect information game\n\n37:27.160 --> 37:30.120\n or do you really want to consider it to be a perfect?\n\n37:30.120 --> 37:32.240\n No, that's a good question, yeah.\n\n37:32.240 --> 37:33.080\n That's a good question.\n\n37:33.080 --> 37:37.080\n Do you pay the price of assuming\n\n37:37.080 --> 37:38.640\n that you don't know everything?\n\n37:39.800 --> 37:40.760\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n37:40.760 --> 37:42.120\n It's certainly much easier.\n\n37:42.120 --> 37:45.060\n Games with perfect information are much easier.\n\n37:45.060 --> 37:49.280\n So if you can't get away with it, you should.\n\n37:49.280 --> 37:52.640\n But if the real situation is of imperfect information,\n\n37:52.640 --> 37:55.160\n then you're gonna have to deal with imperfect information.\n\n37:55.160 --> 37:58.080\n Great, so what lessons have you learned\n\n37:58.080 --> 38:00.680\n the Annual Computer Poker Competition?\n\n38:00.680 --> 38:03.440\n An incredible accomplishment of AI.\n\n38:03.440 --> 38:07.000\n You look at the history of Deep Blue, AlphaGo,\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:10.400\n these kind of moments when AI stepped up\n\n38:10.400 --> 38:13.960\n in an engineering effort and a scientific effort combined\n\n38:13.960 --> 38:16.400\n to beat the best of human players.\n\n38:16.400 --> 38:19.480\n So what do you take away from this whole experience?\n\n38:19.480 --> 38:22.440\n What have you learned about designing AI systems\n\n38:22.440 --> 38:23.960\n that play these kinds of games?\n\n38:23.960 --> 38:28.280\n And what does that mean for AI in general,\n\n38:28.280 --> 38:30.760\n for the future of AI development?\n\n38:30.760 --> 38:32.800\n Yeah, so that's a good question.\n\n38:32.800 --> 38:34.560\n So there's so much to say about it.\n\n38:35.440 --> 38:39.120\n I do like this type of performance oriented research.\n\n38:39.120 --> 38:42.000\n Although in my group, we go all the way from like idea\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:44.880\n to theory, to experiments, to big system building,\n\n38:44.880 --> 38:47.960\n to commercialization, so we span that spectrum.\n\n38:47.960 --> 38:51.080\n But I think that in a lot of situations in AI,\n\n38:51.080 --> 38:53.440\n you really have to build the big systems\n\n38:53.440 --> 38:55.640\n and evaluate them at scale\n\n38:55.640 --> 38:57.520\n before you know what works and doesn't.\n\n38:57.520 --> 39:00.080\n And we've seen that in the computational\n\n39:00.080 --> 39:02.880\n game theory community, that there are a lot of techniques\n\n39:02.880 --> 39:04.280\n that look good in the small,\n\n39:05.200 --> 39:07.120\n but then they cease to look good in the large.\n\n39:07.120 --> 39:10.160\n And we've also seen that there are a lot of techniques\n\n39:10.160 --> 39:13.280\n that look superior in theory.\n\n39:13.280 --> 39:16.200\n And I really mean in terms of convergence rates,\n\n39:16.200 --> 39:18.440\n like first order methods, better convergence rates,\n\n39:18.440 --> 39:20.880\n like the CFR based algorithms,\n\n39:20.880 --> 39:24.880\n yet the CFR based algorithms are the fastest in practice.\n\n39:24.880 --> 39:28.240\n So it really tells me that you have to test this in reality.\n\n39:28.240 --> 39:30.880\n The theory isn't tight enough, if you will,\n\n39:30.880 --> 39:34.360\n to tell you which algorithms are better than the others.\n\n39:34.360 --> 39:38.600\n And you have to look at these things in the large,\n\n39:38.600 --> 39:41.480\n because any sort of projections you do from the small\n\n39:41.480 --> 39:43.800\n can at least in this domain be very misleading.\n\n39:43.800 --> 39:46.240\n So that's kind of from a kind of a science\n\n39:46.240 --> 39:49.120\n and engineering perspective, from a personal perspective,\n\n39:49.120 --> 39:51.280\n it's been just a wild experience\n\n39:51.280 --> 39:54.160\n in that with the first poker competition,\n\n39:54.160 --> 39:57.200\n the first brains versus AI,\n\n39:57.200 --> 39:59.840\n man machine poker competition that we organized.\n\n39:59.840 --> 40:01.760\n There had been, by the way, for other poker games,\n\n40:01.760 --> 40:03.240\n there had been previous competitions,\n\n40:03.240 --> 40:06.360\n but this was for Heads Up No Limit, this was the first.\n\n40:06.360 --> 40:09.560\n And I probably became the most hated person\n\n40:09.560 --> 40:10.880\n in the world of poker.\n\n40:10.880 --> 40:12.880\n And I didn't mean to, I just saw.\n\n40:12.880 --> 40:13.720\n Why is that?\n\n40:13.720 --> 40:15.840\n For cracking the game, for something.\n\n40:15.840 --> 40:20.000\n Yeah, a lot of people felt that it was a real threat\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.760\n to the whole game, the whole existence of the game.\n\n40:22.760 --> 40:26.080\n If AI becomes better than humans,\n\n40:26.080 --> 40:28.520\n people would be scared to play poker\n\n40:28.520 --> 40:30.680\n because there are these superhuman AIs running around\n\n40:30.680 --> 40:32.760\n taking their money and all of that.\n\n40:32.760 --> 40:36.200\n So I just, it's just really aggressive.\n\n40:36.200 --> 40:37.880\n The comments were super aggressive.\n\n40:37.880 --> 40:40.920\n I got everything just short of death threats.\n\n40:40.920 --> 40:44.000\n Do you think the same was true for chess?\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:45.760\n Because right now they just completed\n\n40:45.760 --> 40:47.720\n the world championships in chess,\n\n40:47.720 --> 40:49.560\n and humans just started ignoring the fact\n\n40:49.560 --> 40:52.920\n that there's AI systems now that outperform humans\n\n40:52.920 --> 40:55.520\n and they still enjoy the game, it's still a beautiful game.\n\n40:55.520 --> 40:56.360\n That's what I think.\n\n40:56.360 --> 40:58.800\n And I think the same thing happens in poker.\n\n40:58.800 --> 41:01.040\n And so I didn't think of myself\n\n41:01.040 --> 41:02.360\n as somebody who was gonna kill the game,\n\n41:02.360 --> 41:03.800\n and I don't think I did.\n\n41:03.800 --> 41:05.600\n I've really learned to love this game.\n\n41:05.600 --> 41:06.960\n I wasn't a poker player before,\n\n41:06.960 --> 41:10.520\n but learned so many nuances about it from these AIs,\n\n41:10.520 --> 41:12.480\n and they've really changed how the game is played,\n\n41:12.480 --> 41:13.320\n by the way.\n\n41:13.320 --> 41:16.240\n So they have these very Martian ways of playing poker,\n\n41:16.240 --> 41:18.400\n and the top humans are now incorporating\n\n41:18.400 --> 41:21.400\n those types of strategies into their own play.\n\n41:21.400 --> 41:26.400\n So if anything, to me, our work has made poker\n\n41:26.560 --> 41:29.800\n a richer, more interesting game for humans to play,\n\n41:29.800 --> 41:32.160\n not something that is gonna steer humans\n\n41:32.160 --> 41:34.200\n away from it entirely.\n\n41:34.200 --> 41:35.960\n Just a quick comment on something you said,\n\n41:35.960 --> 41:39.400\n which is, if I may say so,\n\n41:39.400 --> 41:42.400\n in academia is a little bit rare sometimes.\n\n41:42.400 --> 41:45.520\n It's pretty brave to put your ideas to the test\n\n41:45.520 --> 41:47.200\n in the way you described,\n\n41:47.200 --> 41:49.360\n saying that sometimes good ideas don't work\n\n41:49.360 --> 41:52.760\n when you actually try to apply them at scale.\n\n41:52.760 --> 41:54.200\n So where does that come from?\n\n41:54.200 --> 41:58.880\n I mean, if you could do advice for people,\n\n41:58.880 --> 42:00.760\n what drives you in that sense?\n\n42:00.760 --> 42:02.360\n Were you always this way?\n\n42:02.360 --> 42:04.080\n I mean, it takes a brave person.\n\n42:04.080 --> 42:06.760\n I guess is what I'm saying, to test their ideas\n\n42:06.760 --> 42:08.640\n and to see if this thing actually works\n\n42:08.640 --> 42:11.680\n against human top human players and so on.\n\n42:11.680 --> 42:12.960\n Yeah, I don't know about brave,\n\n42:12.960 --> 42:15.000\n but it takes a lot of work.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.320\n It takes a lot of work and a lot of time\n\n42:18.400 --> 42:20.360\n to organize, to make something big\n\n42:20.360 --> 42:22.920\n and to organize an event and stuff like that.\n\n42:22.920 --> 42:24.760\n And what drives you in that effort?\n\n42:24.760 --> 42:26.880\n Because you could still, I would argue,\n\n42:26.880 --> 42:30.280\n get a best paper award at NIPS as you did in 17\n\n42:30.280 --> 42:31.440\n without doing this.\n\n42:31.440 --> 42:32.960\n That's right, yes.\n\n42:32.960 --> 42:37.640\n And so in general, I believe it's very important\n\n42:37.640 --> 42:41.480\n to do things in the real world and at scale.\n\n42:41.480 --> 42:46.160\n And that's really where the pudding, if you will,\n\n42:46.160 --> 42:48.400\n proof is in the pudding, that's where it is.\n\n42:48.400 --> 42:50.080\n In this particular case,\n\n42:50.080 --> 42:55.080\n it was kind of a competition between different groups\n\n42:55.160 --> 42:59.080\n and for many years as to who can be the first one\n\n42:59.080 --> 43:02.040\n to beat the top humans at Heads Up No Limit, Texas Holdem.\n\n43:02.040 --> 43:07.040\n So it became kind of like a competition who can get there.\n\n43:09.560 --> 43:11.800\n Yeah, so a little friendly competition\n\n43:11.800 --> 43:14.040\n could do wonders for progress.\n\n43:14.040 --> 43:15.040\n Yes, absolutely.\n\n43:16.400 --> 43:19.040\n So the topic of mechanism design,\n\n43:19.040 --> 43:22.280\n which is really interesting, also kind of new to me,\n\n43:22.280 --> 43:25.680\n except as an observer of, I don't know, politics and any,\n\n43:25.680 --> 43:27.600\n I'm an observer of mechanisms,\n\n43:27.600 --> 43:31.440\n but you write in your paper an automated mechanism design\n\n43:31.440 --> 43:34.000\n that I quickly read.\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:37.880\n So mechanism design is designing the rules of the game\n\n43:37.880 --> 43:40.200\n so you get a certain desirable outcome.\n\n43:40.200 --> 43:44.920\n And you have this work on doing so in an automatic fashion\n\n43:44.920 --> 43:46.720\n as opposed to fine tuning it.\n\n43:46.720 --> 43:50.680\n So what have you learned from those efforts?\n\n43:50.680 --> 43:52.280\n If you look, say, I don't know,\n\n43:52.280 --> 43:56.200\n at complexes like our political system,\n\n43:56.200 --> 43:58.560\n can we design our political system\n\n43:58.560 --> 44:01.800\n to have, in an automated fashion,\n\n44:01.800 --> 44:03.360\n to have outcomes that we want?\n\n44:03.360 --> 44:08.360\n Can we design something like traffic lights to be smart\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.800\n where it gets outcomes that we want?\n\n44:11.800 --> 44:14.840\n So what are the lessons that you draw from that work?\n\n44:14.840 --> 44:17.240\n Yeah, so I still very much believe\n\n44:17.240 --> 44:19.400\n in the automated mechanism design direction.\n\n44:19.400 --> 44:20.840\n Yes.\n\n44:20.840 --> 44:23.000\n But it's not a panacea.\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:26.520\n There are impossibility results in mechanism design\n\n44:26.520 --> 44:30.240\n saying that there is no mechanism that accomplishes\n\n44:30.240 --> 44:33.920\n objective X in class C.\n\n44:33.920 --> 44:36.120\n So it's not going to,\n\n44:36.120 --> 44:39.000\n there's no way using any mechanism design tools,\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\n manual or automated,\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:42.800\n to do certain things in mechanism design.\n\n44:42.800 --> 44:43.800\n Can you describe that again?\n\n44:43.800 --> 44:47.480\n So meaning it's impossible to achieve that?\n\n44:47.480 --> 44:48.320\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n44:48.320 --> 44:50.440\n And it's unlikely.\n\n44:50.440 --> 44:51.280\n Impossible.\n\n44:51.280 --> 44:52.120\n Impossible.\n\n44:52.120 --> 44:55.240\n So these are not statements about human ingenuity\n\n44:55.240 --> 44:57.120\n who might come up with something smart.\n\n44:57.120 --> 44:59.880\n These are proofs that if you want to accomplish\n\n44:59.880 --> 45:02.480\n properties X in class C,\n\n45:02.480 --> 45:04.880\n that is not doable with any mechanism.\n\n45:04.880 --> 45:07.080\n The good thing about automated mechanism design\n\n45:07.080 --> 45:10.840\n is that we're not really designing for a class.\n\n45:10.840 --> 45:14.160\n We're designing for specific settings at a time.\n\n45:14.160 --> 45:16.720\n So even if there's an impossibility result\n\n45:16.720 --> 45:18.240\n for the whole class,\n\n45:18.240 --> 45:21.360\n it just doesn't mean that all of the cases\n\n45:21.360 --> 45:22.560\n in the class are impossible.\n\n45:22.560 --> 45:25.080\n It just means that some of the cases are impossible.\n\n45:25.080 --> 45:28.240\n So we can actually carve these islands of possibility\n\n45:28.240 --> 45:30.920\n within these known impossible classes.\n\n45:30.920 --> 45:31.960\n And we've actually done that.\n\n45:31.960 --> 45:35.160\n So one of the famous results in mechanism design\n\n45:35.160 --> 45:37.360\n is the Meyerson Satethweight theorem\n\n45:37.360 --> 45:41.000\n by Roger Meyerson and Mark Satethweight from 1983.\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:43.480\n It's an impossibility of efficient trade\n\n45:43.480 --> 45:45.200\n under imperfect information.\n\n45:45.200 --> 45:48.560\n We show that you can, in many settings,\n\n45:48.560 --> 45:51.480\n avoid that and get efficient trade anyway.\n\n45:51.480 --> 45:54.160\n Depending on how they design the game, okay.\n\n45:54.160 --> 45:55.880\n Depending how you design the game.\n\n45:55.880 --> 46:00.240\n And of course, it doesn't in any way\n\n46:00.240 --> 46:01.800\n contradict the impossibility result.\n\n46:01.800 --> 46:03.920\n The impossibility result is still there,\n\n46:03.920 --> 46:08.000\n but it just finds spots within this impossible class\n\n46:08.920 --> 46:12.440\n where in those spots, you don't have the impossibility.\n\n46:12.440 --> 46:14.760\n Sorry if I'm going a bit philosophical,\n\n46:14.760 --> 46:17.480\n but what lessons do you draw towards,\n\n46:17.480 --> 46:20.160\n like I mentioned, politics or human interaction\n\n46:20.160 --> 46:24.880\n and designing mechanisms for outside of just\n\n46:24.880 --> 46:26.960\n these kinds of trading or auctioning\n\n46:26.960 --> 46:31.960\n or purely formal games or human interaction,\n\n46:33.480 --> 46:34.920\n like a political system?\n\n46:34.920 --> 46:39.160\n How, do you think it's applicable to, yeah, politics\n\n46:39.160 --> 46:44.160\n or to business, to negotiations, these kinds of things,\n\n46:46.280 --> 46:49.040\n designing rules that have certain outcomes?\n\n46:49.040 --> 46:51.360\n Yeah, yeah, I do think so.\n\n46:51.360 --> 46:54.200\n Have you seen that successfully done?\n\n46:54.200 --> 46:56.440\n They haven't really, oh, you mean mechanism design\n\n46:56.440 --> 46:57.280\n or automated mechanism design?\n\n46:57.280 --> 46:59.000\n Automated mechanism design.\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.520\n So mechanism design itself\n\n47:01.520 --> 47:06.440\n has had fairly limited success so far.\n\n47:06.440 --> 47:07.600\n There are certain cases,\n\n47:07.600 --> 47:10.200\n but most of the real world situations\n\n47:10.200 --> 47:14.680\n are actually not sound from a mechanism design perspective,\n\n47:14.680 --> 47:16.920\n even in those cases where they've been designed\n\n47:16.920 --> 47:20.000\n by very knowledgeable mechanism design people,\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.760\n the people are typically just taking some insights\n\n47:22.760 --> 47:25.040\n from the theory and applying those insights\n\n47:25.040 --> 47:26.280\n into the real world,\n\n47:26.280 --> 47:29.280\n rather than applying the mechanisms directly.\n\n47:29.280 --> 47:33.520\n So one famous example of is the FCC spectrum auctions.\n\n47:33.520 --> 47:36.880\n So I've also had a small role in that\n\n47:36.880 --> 47:40.600\n and very good economists have been working,\n\n47:40.600 --> 47:42.560\n excellent economists have been working on that\n\n47:42.560 --> 47:44.040\n with no game theory,\n\n47:44.040 --> 47:47.440\n yet the rules that are designed in practice there,\n\n47:47.440 --> 47:49.840\n they're such that bidding truthfully\n\n47:49.840 --> 47:51.800\n is not the best strategy.\n\n47:51.800 --> 47:52.960\n Usually mechanism design,\n\n47:52.960 --> 47:56.160\n we try to make things easy for the participants.\n\n47:56.160 --> 47:58.560\n So telling the truth is the best strategy,\n\n47:58.560 --> 48:01.480\n but even in those very high stakes auctions\n\n48:01.480 --> 48:03.080\n where you have tens of billions of dollars\n\n48:03.080 --> 48:05.200\n worth of spectrum being auctioned,\n\n48:06.360 --> 48:08.280\n truth telling is not the best strategy.\n\n48:08.280 --> 48:10.040\n And by the way,\n\n48:10.040 --> 48:12.920\n nobody knows even a single optimal bidding strategy\n\n48:12.920 --> 48:14.120\n for those auctions.\n\n48:14.120 --> 48:15.960\n What's the challenge of coming up with an optimal,\n\n48:15.960 --> 48:18.160\n because there's a lot of players and there's imperfect.\n\n48:18.160 --> 48:20.040\n It's not so much that a lot of players,\n\n48:20.040 --> 48:22.320\n but many items for sale,\n\n48:22.320 --> 48:26.000\n and these mechanisms are such that even with just two items\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.400\n or one item, bidding truthfully\n\n48:28.400 --> 48:30.400\n wouldn't be the best strategy.\n\n48:31.400 --> 48:34.560\n If you look at the history of AI,\n\n48:34.560 --> 48:37.160\n it's marked by seminal events.\n\n48:37.160 --> 48:40.160\n AlphaGo beating a world champion human Go player,\n\n48:40.160 --> 48:43.680\n I would put Liberatus winning the Heads Up No Limit Holdem\n\n48:43.680 --> 48:45.000\n as one of such event.\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:46.040\n Thank you.\n\n48:46.040 --> 48:51.040\n And what do you think is the next such event,\n\n48:52.560 --> 48:56.640\n whether it's in your life or in the broadly AI community\n\n48:56.640 --> 48:59.040\n that you think might be out there\n\n48:59.040 --> 49:01.640\n that would surprise the world?\n\n49:01.640 --> 49:02.800\n So that's a great question,\n\n49:02.800 --> 49:04.520\n and I don't really know the answer.\n\n49:04.520 --> 49:06.160\n In terms of game solving,\n\n49:07.360 --> 49:08.920\n Heads Up No Limit Texas Holdem\n\n49:08.920 --> 49:13.920\n really was the one remaining widely agreed upon benchmark.\n\n49:14.400 --> 49:15.880\n So that was the big milestone.\n\n49:15.880 --> 49:17.800\n Now, are there other things?\n\n49:17.800 --> 49:18.920\n Yeah, certainly there are,\n\n49:18.920 --> 49:21.080\n but there's not one that the community\n\n49:21.080 --> 49:22.920\n has kind of focused on.\n\n49:22.920 --> 49:25.240\n So what could be other things?\n\n49:25.240 --> 49:27.640\n There are groups working on StarCraft.\n\n49:27.640 --> 49:29.840\n There are groups working on Dota 2.\n\n49:29.840 --> 49:31.560\n These are video games.\n\n49:31.560 --> 49:36.240\n Or you could have like Diplomacy or Hanabi,\n\n49:36.240 --> 49:37.080\n things like that.\n\n49:37.080 --> 49:38.640\n These are like recreational games,\n\n49:38.640 --> 49:42.040\n but none of them are really acknowledged\n\n49:42.040 --> 49:45.840\n as kind of the main next challenge problem,\n\n49:45.840 --> 49:50.000\n like chess or Go or Heads Up No Limit Texas Holdem was.\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.360\n So I don't really know in the game solving space\n\n49:52.360 --> 49:55.400\n what is or what will be the next benchmark.\n\n49:55.400 --> 49:57.840\n I kind of hope that there will be a next benchmark\n\n49:57.840 --> 49:59.560\n because really the different groups\n\n49:59.560 --> 50:01.120\n working on the same problem\n\n50:01.120 --> 50:05.120\n really drove these application independent techniques\n\n50:05.120 --> 50:07.480\n forward very quickly over 10 years.\n\n50:07.480 --> 50:09.120\n Do you think there's an open problem\n\n50:09.120 --> 50:11.480\n that excites you that you start moving away\n\n50:11.480 --> 50:15.000\n from games into real world games,\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:17.200\n like say the stock market trading?\n\n50:17.200 --> 50:19.320\n Yeah, so that's kind of how I am.\n\n50:19.320 --> 50:23.120\n So I am probably not going to work\n\n50:23.120 --> 50:27.640\n as hard on these recreational benchmarks.\n\n50:27.640 --> 50:30.200\n I'm doing two startups on game solving technology,\n\n50:30.200 --> 50:32.320\n Strategic Machine and Strategy Robot,\n\n50:32.320 --> 50:34.160\n and we're really interested\n\n50:34.160 --> 50:36.560\n in pushing this stuff into practice.\n\n50:36.560 --> 50:40.080\n What do you think would be really\n\n50:43.160 --> 50:45.920\n a powerful result that would be surprising\n\n50:45.920 --> 50:49.960\n that would be, if you can say,\n\n50:49.960 --> 50:53.280\n I mean, five years, 10 years from now,\n\n50:53.280 --> 50:56.480\n something that statistically you would say\n\n50:56.480 --> 50:57.920\n is not very likely,\n\n50:57.920 --> 51:01.480\n but if there's a breakthrough, would achieve?\n\n51:01.480 --> 51:03.800\n Yeah, so I think that overall,\n\n51:03.800 --> 51:08.800\n we're in a very different situation in game theory\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.760\n than we are in, let's say, machine learning.\n\n51:11.760 --> 51:14.360\n So in machine learning, it's a fairly mature technology\n\n51:14.360 --> 51:16.480\n and it's very broadly applied\n\n51:16.480 --> 51:19.680\n and proven success in the real world.\n\n51:19.680 --> 51:22.840\n In game solving, there are almost no applications yet.\n\n51:24.320 --> 51:26.680\n We have just become superhuman,\n\n51:26.680 --> 51:29.600\n which machine learning you could argue happened in the 90s,\n\n51:29.600 --> 51:30.640\n if not earlier,\n\n51:30.640 --> 51:32.960\n and at least on supervised learning,\n\n51:32.960 --> 51:35.400\n certain complex supervised learning applications.\n\n51:36.960 --> 51:39.000\n Now, I think the next challenge problem,\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:40.560\n I know you're not asking about it this way,\n\n51:40.560 --> 51:42.640\n you're asking about the technology breakthrough,\n\n51:42.640 --> 51:44.240\n but I think that big, big breakthrough\n\n51:44.240 --> 51:46.120\n is to be able to show that, hey,\n\n51:46.120 --> 51:48.280\n maybe most of, let's say, military planning\n\n51:48.280 --> 51:50.080\n or most of business strategy\n\n51:50.080 --> 51:52.200\n will actually be done strategically\n\n51:52.200 --> 51:54.120\n using computational game theory.\n\n51:54.120 --> 51:55.800\n That's what I would like to see\n\n51:55.800 --> 51:57.640\n as the next five or 10 year goal.\n\n51:57.640 --> 51:59.520\n Maybe you can explain to me again,\n\n51:59.520 --> 52:01.920\n forgive me if this is an obvious question,\n\n52:01.920 --> 52:04.000\n but machine learning methods,\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:07.840\n neural networks suffer from not being transparent,\n\n52:07.840 --> 52:09.280\n not being explainable.\n\n52:09.280 --> 52:12.400\n Game theoretic methods, Nash equilibria,\n\n52:12.400 --> 52:15.280\n do they generally, when you see the different solutions,\n\n52:15.280 --> 52:19.640\n are they, when you talk about military operations,\n\n52:19.640 --> 52:21.800\n are they, once you see the strategies,\n\n52:21.800 --> 52:23.880\n do they make sense, are they explainable,\n\n52:23.880 --> 52:25.840\n or do they suffer from the same problems\n\n52:25.840 --> 52:27.120\n as neural networks do?\n\n52:27.120 --> 52:28.720\n So that's a good question.\n\n52:28.720 --> 52:31.240\n I would say a little bit yes and no.\n\n52:31.240 --> 52:34.560\n And what I mean by that is that\n\n52:34.560 --> 52:36.160\n these game theoretic strategies,\n\n52:36.160 --> 52:38.520\n let's say, Nash equilibrium,\n\n52:38.520 --> 52:40.320\n it has provable properties.\n\n52:40.320 --> 52:42.360\n So it's unlike, let's say, deep learning\n\n52:42.360 --> 52:44.440\n where you kind of cross your fingers,\n\n52:44.440 --> 52:45.680\n hopefully it'll work.\n\n52:45.680 --> 52:47.880\n And then after the fact, when you have the weights,\n\n52:47.880 --> 52:48.920\n you're still crossing your fingers,\n\n52:48.920 --> 52:50.160\n and I hope it will work.\n\n52:51.160 --> 52:55.400\n Here, you know that the solution quality is there.\n\n52:55.400 --> 52:58.040\n There's provable solution quality guarantees.\n\n52:58.040 --> 53:00.920\n Now, that doesn't necessarily mean\n\n53:00.920 --> 53:03.480\n that the strategies are human understandable.\n\n53:03.480 --> 53:04.720\n That's a whole other problem.\n\n53:04.720 --> 53:08.680\n So I think that deep learning and computational game theory\n\n53:08.680 --> 53:10.720\n are in the same boat in that sense,\n\n53:10.720 --> 53:12.680\n that both are difficult to understand.\n\n53:13.760 --> 53:15.680\n But at least the game theoretic techniques,\n\n53:15.680 --> 53:19.840\n they have these guarantees of solution quality.\n\n53:19.840 --> 53:22.880\n So do you see business operations, strategic operations,\n\n53:22.880 --> 53:26.040\n or even military in the future being\n\n53:26.040 --> 53:28.320\n at least the strong candidates\n\n53:28.320 --> 53:32.760\n being proposed by automated systems?\n\n53:32.760 --> 53:34.000\n Do you see that?\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:35.040\n Yeah, I do, I do.\n\n53:35.040 --> 53:39.640\n But that's more of a belief than a substantiated fact.\n\n53:39.640 --> 53:42.320\n Depending on where you land in optimism or pessimism,\n\n53:42.320 --> 53:45.720\n that's a really, to me, that's an exciting future,\n\n53:45.720 --> 53:48.760\n especially if there's provable things\n\n53:48.760 --> 53:50.560\n in terms of optimality.\n\n53:50.560 --> 53:54.040\n So looking into the future,\n\n53:54.040 --> 53:58.760\n there's a few folks worried about the,\n\n53:58.760 --> 54:01.200\n especially you look at the game of poker,\n\n54:01.200 --> 54:03.360\n which is probably one of the last benchmarks\n\n54:03.360 --> 54:05.480\n in terms of games being solved.\n\n54:05.480 --> 54:07.520\n They worry about the future\n\n54:07.520 --> 54:10.520\n and the existential threats of artificial intelligence.\n\n54:10.520 --> 54:13.840\n So the negative impact in whatever form on society.\n\n54:13.840 --> 54:17.440\n Is that something that concerns you as much,\n\n54:17.440 --> 54:21.600\n or are you more optimistic about the positive impacts of AI?\n\n54:21.600 --> 54:24.720\n Oh, I am much more optimistic about the positive impacts.\n\n54:24.720 --> 54:27.560\n So just in my own work, what we've done so far,\n\n54:27.560 --> 54:29.920\n we run the nationwide kidney exchange.\n\n54:29.920 --> 54:32.960\n Hundreds of people are walking around alive today,\n\n54:32.960 --> 54:34.080\n who would it be?\n\n54:34.080 --> 54:36.120\n And it's increased employment.\n\n54:36.120 --> 54:39.920\n You have a lot of people now running kidney exchanges\n\n54:39.920 --> 54:42.200\n and at the transplant centers,\n\n54:42.200 --> 54:45.560\n interacting with the kidney exchange.\n\n54:45.560 --> 54:49.440\n You have extra surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists,\n\n54:49.440 --> 54:51.400\n hospitals, all of that.\n\n54:51.400 --> 54:53.560\n So employment is increasing from that\n\n54:53.560 --> 54:55.320\n and the world is becoming a better place.\n\n54:55.320 --> 54:59.040\n Another example is combinatorial sourcing auctions.\n\n54:59.040 --> 55:04.040\n We did 800 large scale combinatorial sourcing auctions\n\n55:04.040 --> 55:08.240\n from 2001 to 2010 in a previous startup of mine\n\n55:08.240 --> 55:09.400\n called CombineNet.\n\n55:09.400 --> 55:13.080\n And we increased the supply chain efficiency\n\n55:13.080 --> 55:18.080\n on that $60 billion of spend by 12.6%.\n\n55:18.080 --> 55:21.440\n So that's over $6 billion of efficiency improvement\n\n55:21.440 --> 55:22.240\n in the world.\n\n55:22.240 --> 55:23.760\n And this is not like shifting value\n\n55:23.760 --> 55:25.240\n from somebody to somebody else,\n\n55:25.240 --> 55:28.200\n just efficiency improvement, like in trucking,\n\n55:28.200 --> 55:31.120\n less empty driving, so there's less waste,\n\n55:31.120 --> 55:33.440\n less carbon footprint and so on.\n\n55:33.440 --> 55:36.720\n So a huge positive impact in the near term,\n\n55:36.720 --> 55:40.680\n but sort of to stay in it for a little longer,\n\n55:40.680 --> 55:43.080\n because I think game theory has a role to play here.\n\n55:43.080 --> 55:45.320\n Oh, let me actually come back on that as one thing.\n\n55:45.320 --> 55:49.400\n I think AI is also going to make the world much safer.\n\n55:49.400 --> 55:53.760\n So that's another aspect that often gets overlooked.\n\n55:53.760 --> 55:54.920\n Well, let me ask this question.\n\n55:54.920 --> 55:56.960\n Maybe you can speak to the safer.\n\n55:56.960 --> 55:59.960\n So I talked to Max Tegmark and Stuart Russell,\n\n55:59.960 --> 56:02.680\n who are very concerned about existential threats of AI.\n\n56:02.680 --> 56:06.240\n And often the concern is about value misalignment.\n\n56:06.240 --> 56:10.240\n So AI systems basically working,\n\n56:11.880 --> 56:14.680\n operating towards goals that are not the same\n\n56:14.680 --> 56:17.920\n as human civilization, human beings.\n\n56:17.920 --> 56:21.160\n So it seems like game theory has a role to play there\n\n56:24.200 --> 56:27.880\n to make sure the values are aligned with human beings.\n\n56:27.880 --> 56:29.960\n I don't know if that's how you think about it.\n\n56:29.960 --> 56:34.960\n If not, how do you think AI might help with this problem?\n\n56:35.280 --> 56:39.240\n How do you think AI might make the world safer?\n\n56:39.240 --> 56:43.000\n Yeah, I think this value misalignment\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:46.480\n is a fairly theoretical worry.\n\n56:46.480 --> 56:49.960\n And I haven't really seen it in,\n\n56:49.960 --> 56:51.840\n because I do a lot of real applications.\n\n56:51.840 --> 56:53.920\n I don't see it anywhere.\n\n56:53.920 --> 56:55.240\n The closest I've seen it\n\n56:55.240 --> 56:57.920\n was the following type of mental exercise really,\n\n56:57.920 --> 57:00.720\n where I had this argument in the late eighties\n\n57:00.720 --> 57:01.560\n when we were building\n\n57:01.560 --> 57:03.560\n these transportation optimization systems.\n\n57:03.560 --> 57:05.360\n And somebody had heard that it's a good idea\n\n57:05.360 --> 57:08.160\n to have high utilization of assets.\n\n57:08.160 --> 57:11.400\n So they told me, hey, why don't you put that as objective?\n\n57:11.400 --> 57:14.720\n And we didn't even put it as an objective\n\n57:14.720 --> 57:16.480\n because I just showed him that,\n\n57:16.480 --> 57:18.480\n if you had that as your objective,\n\n57:18.480 --> 57:20.320\n the solution would be to load your trucks full\n\n57:20.320 --> 57:21.840\n and drive in circles.\n\n57:21.840 --> 57:23.000\n Nothing would ever get delivered.\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:25.120\n You'd have a hundred percent utilization.\n\n57:25.120 --> 57:27.240\n So yeah, I know this phenomenon.\n\n57:27.240 --> 57:29.680\n I've known this for over 30 years,\n\n57:29.680 --> 57:33.360\n but I've never seen it actually be a problem in reality.\n\n57:33.360 --> 57:35.240\n And yes, if you have the wrong objective,\n\n57:35.240 --> 57:37.800\n the AI will optimize that to the hilt\n\n57:37.800 --> 57:39.800\n and it's gonna hurt more than some human\n\n57:39.800 --> 57:43.800\n who's kind of trying to solve it in a half baked way\n\n57:43.800 --> 57:45.480\n with some human insight too.\n\n57:45.480 --> 57:49.160\n But I just haven't seen that materialize in practice.\n\n57:49.160 --> 57:52.720\n There's this gap that you've actually put your finger on\n\n57:52.720 --> 57:57.080\n very clearly just now between theory and reality.\n\n57:57.080 --> 57:59.680\n That's very difficult to put into words, I think.\n\n57:59.680 --> 58:02.240\n It's what you can theoretically imagine,\n\n58:03.240 --> 58:08.000\n the worst possible case or even, yeah, I mean bad cases.\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:10.520\n And what usually happens in reality.\n\n58:10.520 --> 58:11.960\n So for example, to me,\n\n58:11.960 --> 58:15.720\n maybe it's something you can comment on having grown up\n\n58:15.720 --> 58:17.680\n and I grew up in the Soviet Union.\n\n58:19.120 --> 58:22.120\n There's currently 10,000 nuclear weapons in the world.\n\n58:22.120 --> 58:24.200\n And for many decades,\n\n58:24.200 --> 58:28.360\n it's theoretically surprising to me\n\n58:28.360 --> 58:30.880\n that the nuclear war is not broken out.\n\n58:30.880 --> 58:33.760\n Do you think about this aspect\n\n58:33.760 --> 58:36.080\n from a game theoretic perspective in general,\n\n58:36.080 --> 58:38.440\n why is that true?\n\n58:38.440 --> 58:40.720\n Why in theory you could see\n\n58:40.720 --> 58:42.600\n how things would go terribly wrong\n\n58:42.600 --> 58:44.280\n and somehow yet they have not?\n\n58:44.280 --> 58:45.600\n Yeah, how do you think about it?\n\n58:45.600 --> 58:47.240\n So I do think about that a lot.\n\n58:47.240 --> 58:50.320\n I think the biggest two threats that we're facing as mankind,\n\n58:50.320 --> 58:53.320\n one is climate change and the other is nuclear war.\n\n58:53.320 --> 58:57.200\n So those are my main two worries that I worry about.\n\n58:57.200 --> 58:59.920\n And I've tried to do something about climate,\n\n58:59.920 --> 59:01.320\n thought about trying to do something\n\n59:01.320 --> 59:02.880\n for climate change twice.\n\n59:02.880 --> 59:05.040\n Actually, for two of my startups,\n\n59:05.040 --> 59:06.760\n I've actually commissioned studies\n\n59:06.760 --> 59:09.480\n of what we could do on those things.\n\n59:09.480 --> 59:11.040\n And we didn't really find a sweet spot,\n\n59:11.040 --> 59:12.680\n but I'm still keeping an eye out on that.\n\n59:12.680 --> 59:15.160\n If there's something where we could actually\n\n59:15.160 --> 59:17.800\n provide a market solution or optimizations solution\n\n59:17.800 --> 59:20.960\n or some other technology solution to problems.\n\n59:20.960 --> 59:23.360\n Right now, like for example,\n\n59:23.360 --> 59:26.760\n pollution critic markets was what we were looking at then.\n\n59:26.760 --> 59:30.040\n And it was much more the lack of political will\n\n59:30.040 --> 59:32.840\n by those markets were not so successful\n\n59:32.840 --> 59:34.640\n rather than bad market design.\n\n59:34.640 --> 59:37.080\n So I could go in and make a better market design,\n\n59:37.080 --> 59:38.600\n but that wouldn't really move the needle\n\n59:38.600 --> 59:41.160\n on the world very much if there's no political will.\n\n59:41.160 --> 59:43.600\n And in the US, the market,\n\n59:43.600 --> 59:47.520\n at least the Chicago market was just shut down and so on.\n\n59:47.520 --> 59:48.760\n So then it doesn't really help\n\n59:48.760 --> 59:51.040\n how great your market design was.\n\n59:51.040 --> 59:53.560\n And then the nuclear side, it's more,\n\n59:53.560 --> 59:57.560\n so global warming is a more encroaching problem.\n\n1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:03.280\n Nuclear weapons have been here.\n\n1:00:03.280 --> 1:00:05.720\n It's an obvious problem that's just been sitting there.\n\n1:00:05.720 --> 1:00:07.480\n So how do you think about,\n\n1:00:07.480 --> 1:00:09.240\n what is the mechanism design there\n\n1:00:09.240 --> 1:00:12.280\n that just made everything seem stable?\n\n1:00:12.280 --> 1:00:14.800\n And are you still extremely worried?\n\n1:00:14.800 --> 1:00:16.640\n I am still extremely worried.\n\n1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:20.040\n So you probably know the simple game theory of mad.\n\n1:00:20.040 --> 1:00:23.760\n So this was a mutually assured destruction\n\n1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:27.360\n and it doesn't require any computation with small matrices.\n\n1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:28.600\n You can actually convince yourself\n\n1:00:28.600 --> 1:00:31.480\n that the game is such that nobody wants to initiate.\n\n1:00:31.480 --> 1:00:34.600\n Yeah, that's a very coarse grained analysis.\n\n1:00:34.600 --> 1:00:36.880\n And it really works in a situational way.\n\n1:00:36.880 --> 1:00:40.400\n You have two superpowers or small number of superpowers.\n\n1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:41.960\n Now things are very different.\n\n1:00:41.960 --> 1:00:43.080\n You have a smaller nuke.\n\n1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:47.240\n So the threshold of initiating is smaller\n\n1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:51.520\n and you have smaller countries and non nation actors\n\n1:00:51.520 --> 1:00:53.760\n who may get a nuke and so on.\n\n1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:58.320\n So I think it's riskier now than it was maybe ever before.\n\n1:00:58.320 --> 1:01:03.320\n And what idea, application of AI,\n\n1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:04.640\n you've talked about a little bit,\n\n1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:07.560\n but what is the most exciting to you right now?\n\n1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:10.160\n I mean, you're here at NIPS, NeurIPS.\n\n1:01:10.160 --> 1:01:14.920\n Now you have a few excellent pieces of work,\n\n1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:16.680\n but what are you thinking into the future\n\n1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:17.840\n with several companies you're doing?\n\n1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:21.120\n What's the most exciting thing or one of the exciting things?\n\n1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:23.160\n The number one thing for me right now\n\n1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:26.360\n is coming up with these scalable techniques\n\n1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:30.440\n for game solving and applying them into the real world.\n\n1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:33.160\n I'm still very interested in market design as well.\n\n1:01:33.160 --> 1:01:35.400\n And we're doing that in the optimized markets,\n\n1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:37.560\n but I'm most interested if number one right now\n\n1:01:37.560 --> 1:01:40.000\n is strategic machine strategy robot,\n\n1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:41.440\n getting that technology out there\n\n1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:45.560\n and seeing as you were in the trenches doing applications,\n\n1:01:45.560 --> 1:01:47.120\n what needs to be actually filled,\n\n1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:49.800\n what technology gaps still need to be filled.\n\n1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:52.040\n So it's so hard to just put your feet on the table\n\n1:01:52.040 --> 1:01:53.800\n and imagine what needs to be done.\n\n1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:56.280\n But when you're actually doing real applications,\n\n1:01:56.280 --> 1:01:59.120\n the applications tell you what needs to be done.\n\n1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:00.840\n And I really enjoy that interaction.\n\n1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:04.480\n Is it a challenging process to apply\n\n1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:07.760\n some of the state of the art techniques you're working on\n\n1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:12.760\n and having the various players in industry\n\n1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:17.720\n or the military or people who could really benefit from it\n\n1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:19.040\n actually use it?\n\n1:02:19.040 --> 1:02:21.400\n What's that process like of,\n\n1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:23.680\n autonomous vehicles work with automotive companies\n\n1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:28.200\n and they're in many ways are a little bit old fashioned.\n\n1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:29.240\n It's difficult.\n\n1:02:29.240 --> 1:02:31.840\n They really want to use this technology.\n\n1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:34.640\n There's clearly will have a significant benefit,\n\n1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:37.480\n but the systems aren't quite in place\n\n1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:41.080\n to easily have them integrated in terms of data,\n\n1:02:41.080 --> 1:02:43.760\n in terms of compute, in terms of all these kinds of things.\n\n1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:48.680\n So is that one of the bigger challenges that you're facing\n\n1:02:48.680 --> 1:02:50.000\n and how do you tackle that challenge?\n\n1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:52.360\n Yeah, I think that's always a challenge.\n\n1:02:52.360 --> 1:02:54.520\n That's kind of slowness and inertia really\n\n1:02:55.560 --> 1:02:57.920\n of let's do things the way we've always done it.\n\n1:02:57.920 --> 1:03:00.120\n You just have to find the internal champions\n\n1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:02.120\n at the customer who understand that,\n\n1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:04.680\n hey, things can't be the same way in the future.\n\n1:03:04.680 --> 1:03:06.960\n Otherwise bad things are going to happen.\n\n1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:08.600\n And it's in autonomous vehicles.\n\n1:03:08.600 --> 1:03:09.680\n It's actually very interesting\n\n1:03:09.680 --> 1:03:11.120\n that the car makers are doing that\n\n1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:12.440\n and they're very traditional,\n\n1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:14.360\n but at the same time you have tech companies\n\n1:03:14.360 --> 1:03:17.120\n who have nothing to do with cars or transportation\n\n1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:21.880\n like Google and Baidu really pushing on autonomous cars.\n\n1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:23.240\n I find that fascinating.\n\n1:03:23.240 --> 1:03:25.160\n Clearly you're super excited\n\n1:03:25.160 --> 1:03:29.320\n about actually these ideas having an impact in the world.\n\n1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:32.680\n In terms of the technology, in terms of ideas and research,\n\n1:03:32.680 --> 1:03:36.600\n are there directions that you're also excited about?\n\n1:03:36.600 --> 1:03:40.840\n Whether that's on some of the approaches you talked about\n\n1:03:40.840 --> 1:03:42.760\n for the imperfect information games,\n\n1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:44.000\n whether it's applying deep learning\n\n1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:45.120\n to some of these problems,\n\n1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:46.520\n is there something that you're excited\n\n1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:48.840\n in the research side of things?\n\n1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:51.120\n Yeah, yeah, lots of different things\n\n1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:53.240\n in the game solving.\n\n1:03:53.240 --> 1:03:56.400\n So solving even bigger games,\n\n1:03:56.400 --> 1:03:59.760\n games where you have more hidden action\n\n1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:02.040\n of the player actions as well.\n\n1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:05.880\n Poker is a game where really the chance actions are hidden\n\n1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:07.080\n or some of them are hidden,\n\n1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:08.720\n but the player actions are public.\n\n1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:14.000\n Multiplayer games of various sorts,\n\n1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:18.080\n collusion, opponent exploitation,\n\n1:04:18.080 --> 1:04:21.280\n all and even longer games.\n\n1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:23.160\n So games that basically go forever,\n\n1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:24.680\n but they're not repeated.\n\n1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:27.880\n So see extensive fun games that go forever.\n\n1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:30.080\n What would that even look like?\n\n1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:31.040\n How do you represent that?\n\n1:04:31.040 --> 1:04:32.040\n How do you solve that?\n\n1:04:32.040 --> 1:04:33.440\n What's an example of a game like that?\n\n1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:35.600\n Or is this some of the stochastic games\n\n1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:36.440\n that you mentioned?\n\n1:04:36.440 --> 1:04:37.320\n Let's say business strategy.\n\n1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:40.840\n So it's not just modeling like a particular interaction,\n\n1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:44.440\n but thinking about the business from here to eternity.\n\n1:04:44.440 --> 1:04:49.040\n Or let's say military strategy.\n\n1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:51.000\n So it's not like war is gonna go away.\n\n1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:54.280\n How do you think about military strategy\n\n1:04:54.280 --> 1:04:55.520\n that's gonna go forever?\n\n1:04:56.680 --> 1:04:58.080\n How do you even model that?\n\n1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:01.000\n How do you know whether a move was good\n\n1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:05.200\n that somebody made and so on?\n\n1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:06.960\n So that's kind of one direction.\n\n1:05:06.960 --> 1:05:09.800\n I'm also very interested in learning\n\n1:05:09.800 --> 1:05:13.440\n much more scalable techniques for integer programming.\n\n1:05:13.440 --> 1:05:16.560\n So we had an ICML paper this summer on that.\n\n1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:20.280\n The first automated algorithm configuration paper\n\n1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:23.560\n that has theoretical generalization guarantees.\n\n1:05:23.560 --> 1:05:26.200\n So if I see this many training examples\n\n1:05:26.200 --> 1:05:28.560\n and I told my algorithm in this way,\n\n1:05:28.560 --> 1:05:30.560\n it's going to have good performance\n\n1:05:30.560 --> 1:05:33.200\n on the real distribution, which I've not seen.\n\n1:05:33.200 --> 1:05:34.840\n So, which is kind of interesting\n\n1:05:34.840 --> 1:05:37.680\n that algorithm configuration has been going on now\n\n1:05:37.680 --> 1:05:41.200\n for at least 17 years seriously.\n\n1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:45.000\n And there has not been any generalization theory before.\n\n1:05:45.960 --> 1:05:47.200\n Well, this is really exciting\n\n1:05:47.200 --> 1:05:49.840\n and it's a huge honor to talk to you.\n\n1:05:49.840 --> 1:05:51.160\n Thank you so much, Tomas.\n\n1:05:51.160 --> 1:05:52.880\n Thank you for bringing Labradus to the world\n\n1:05:52.880 --> 1:05:54.160\n and all the great work you're doing.\n\n1:05:54.160 --> 1:05:55.000\n Well, thank you very much.\n\n1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:55.840\n It's been fun.\n\n1:05:55.840 --> 1:06:16.840\n No more questions.\n\n"
