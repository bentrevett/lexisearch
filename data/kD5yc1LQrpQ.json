and professor at the City College of New York.\n\n00:08.360 --> 00:10.760\n He's the author of many fascinating books\n\n00:10.760 --> 00:12.840\n that explore the nature of our reality\n\n00:12.840 --> 00:15.520\n and the future of our civilization.\n\n00:15.520 --> 00:19.200\n They include Einstein's Cosmos, Physics of the Impossible,\n\n00:19.200 --> 00:21.600\n Future of the Mind, Parallel Worlds,\n\n00:21.600 --> 00:24.240\n and his latest, The Future of Humanity,\n\n00:24.240 --> 00:26.640\n Terraforming Mars Interstellar Travel,\n\n00:26.640 --> 00:29.960\n Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth.\n\n00:29.960 --> 00:32.960\n I think it's beautiful and important\n\n00:32.960 --> 00:35.760\n when a scientific mind can fearlessly explore\n\n00:35.760 --> 00:37.600\n through conversation subjects\n\n00:37.600 --> 00:40.200\n just outside of our understanding.\n\n00:40.200 --> 00:43.440\n That, to me, is where artificial intelligence is today,\n\n00:43.440 --> 00:45.680\n just outside of our understanding,\n\n00:45.680 --> 00:47.440\n a place we have to reach for\n\n00:47.440 --> 00:50.160\n if we're to uncover the mysteries of the human mind\n\n00:50.160 --> 00:53.880\n and build human level and superhuman level AI systems\n\n00:53.880 --> 00:56.640\n that transform our world for the better.\n\n00:56.640 --> 00:59.240\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n00:59.240 --> 01:01.600\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:01.600 --> 01:04.640\n give it five stars on iTunes, support it on Patreon,\n\n01:04.640 --> 01:06.600\n or simply connect with me on Twitter\n\n01:06.600 --> 01:09.920\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n01:09.920 --> 01:13.700\n And now, here's my conversation with Michio Kaku.\n\n01:14.680 --> 01:17.360\n You've mentioned that we just might make contact\n\n01:17.360 --> 01:21.740\n with aliens or at least hear from them within this century.\n\n01:21.740 --> 01:24.960\n Can you elaborate on your intuition behind that optimism?\n\n01:25.880 --> 01:28.120\n Well, this is pure speculation, of course.\n\n01:28.120 --> 01:28.960\n Of course.\n\n01:28.960 --> 01:31.200\n Given the fact that we've already identified\n\n01:31.200 --> 01:34.560\n 4,000 exoplanets orbiting other stars,\n\n01:34.560 --> 01:37.560\n and we have a census of the Milky Way galaxy\n\n01:37.560 --> 01:39.160\n for the first time,\n\n01:39.160 --> 01:43.560\n we know that on average, every single star, on average,\n\n01:43.560 --> 01:45.640\n has a planet going around it,\n\n01:45.640 --> 01:47.720\n and about one fifth or so of them\n\n01:47.720 --> 01:51.240\n have Earth sized planets going around them.\n\n01:51.240 --> 01:52.960\n So just do the math.\n\n01:52.960 --> 01:56.160\n We're talking about out of 100 billion stars\n\n01:56.160 --> 01:58.140\n in the Milky Way galaxy,\n\n01:58.140 --> 01:59.820\n we're talking about billions\n\n01:59.820 --> 02:02.880\n of potential Earth sized planets.\n\n02:02.880 --> 02:05.760\n And to believe that we're the only one\n\n02:05.760 --> 02:09.160\n is, I think, rather ridiculous, given the odds.\n\n02:09.160 --> 02:11.600\n And how many galaxies are there?\n\n02:11.600 --> 02:14.560\n Within sight of the Hubble Space Telescope,\n\n02:14.560 --> 02:17.880\n there are about 100 billion galaxies.\n\n02:17.880 --> 02:19.680\n So do the math.\n\n02:19.680 --> 02:22.500\n How many stars are there in the visible universe?\n\n02:22.500 --> 02:24.780\n 100 billion galaxies,\n\n02:24.780 --> 02:29.360\n times 100 billion stars per galaxy.\n\n02:29.360 --> 02:33.720\n We're talking about a number beyond human imagination.\n\n02:33.720 --> 02:35.480\n And to believe that we're the only ones,\n\n02:35.480 --> 02:38.200\n I think, is rather ridiculous.\n\n02:38.200 --> 02:42.180\n So you've talked about different types of,\n\n02:42.180 --> 02:44.500\n type zero, one, two, three, four, and five,\n\n02:44.500 --> 02:46.320\n even, of the Kardashev scale\n\n02:47.200 --> 02:49.440\n of the different kind of civilizations.\n\n02:50.440 --> 02:52.780\n What do you think it takes,\n\n02:52.780 --> 02:54.640\n if it is indeed a ridiculous notion\n\n02:54.640 --> 02:56.220\n that we're alone in the universe,\n\n02:56.220 --> 02:58.720\n what do you think it takes to reach out?\n\n02:58.720 --> 03:02.660\n First, to reach out through communication and connect.\n\n03:02.660 --> 03:04.320\n Well, first of all, we have to understand\n\n03:04.320 --> 03:08.720\n the level of sophistication of an alien life form\n\n03:08.720 --> 03:10.520\n if we make contact with them.\n\n03:10.520 --> 03:14.160\n I think in this century, we'll probably pick up signals,\n\n03:14.160 --> 03:17.400\n signals from an extraterrestrial civilization.\n\n03:17.400 --> 03:19.260\n We'll pick up there, I love Lucy,\n\n03:19.260 --> 03:21.280\n and there, leave it to Beaver.\n\n03:21.280 --> 03:23.500\n Just ordinary day to day transmissions\n\n03:23.500 --> 03:25.600\n that they emit.\n\n03:25.600 --> 03:28.200\n And the first thing we wanna do is to A,\n\n03:28.200 --> 03:30.260\n decipher their language, of course,\n\n03:30.260 --> 03:34.980\n but B, figure out at what level they are advanced\n\n03:34.980 --> 03:37.080\n on the Kardashev scale.\n\n03:37.080 --> 03:38.560\n I'm a physicist.\n\n03:38.560 --> 03:43.560\n We rank things by two parameters, energy and information.\n\n03:43.640 --> 03:45.600\n That's how we rank black holes.\n\n03:45.600 --> 03:47.320\n That's how we rank stars.\n\n03:47.320 --> 03:50.600\n That's how we rank civilizations in outer space.\n\n03:50.600 --> 03:54.900\n So a type one civilization is capable\n\n03:54.900 --> 03:57.540\n of harnessing planetary power.\n\n03:57.540 --> 04:01.280\n They control the weather, for example, earthquakes, volcanoes.\n\n04:01.280 --> 04:04.600\n They can modify the course of geological events,\n\n04:04.600 --> 04:08.400\n sort of like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers.\n\n04:08.400 --> 04:11.120\n Type two would be stellar.\n\n04:12.240 --> 04:15.620\n They play with stars, entire stars.\n\n04:15.620 --> 04:18.440\n They use the entire energy output of a star,\n\n04:18.440 --> 04:20.560\n sort of like Star Trek.\n\n04:20.560 --> 04:24.640\n The Federation of Planets have colonized the nearby stars.\n\n04:24.640 --> 04:29.080\n So a type two would be somewhat similar to Star Trek.\n\n04:29.080 --> 04:30.660\n Type three would be galactic.\n\n04:30.660 --> 04:33.840\n They roam the galactic space lanes.\n\n04:33.840 --> 04:37.700\n And type three would be like Star Wars,\n\n04:37.700 --> 04:39.880\n a galactic civilization.\n\n04:39.880 --> 04:42.320\n Now, one day I was giving this talk in London\n\n04:42.320 --> 04:45.580\n at the planetarium there, and the little boy comes up to me\n\n04:45.580 --> 04:48.760\n and he says, professor, you're wrong.\n\n04:48.760 --> 04:51.000\n You're wrong, there's type four.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.360\n And I told him, look, kid,\n\n04:53.360 --> 04:57.000\n there are planets, stars, and galaxies.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.720\n That's it, folks.\n\n04:58.720 --> 05:02.680\n And he kept persisting and saying, no, there's type four,\n\n05:02.680 --> 05:05.800\n the power of the continuum.\n\n05:05.800 --> 05:07.560\n And I thought about it for a moment.\n\n05:07.560 --> 05:08.600\n And I said to myself,\n\n05:08.600 --> 05:12.220\n is there an extra galactic source of energy,\n\n05:12.220 --> 05:14.520\n the continuum of Star Trek?\n\n05:14.520 --> 05:18.080\n And the answer is yes, there could be a type four.\n\n05:18.080 --> 05:20.040\n And that's dark energy.\n\n05:20.040 --> 05:25.040\n We now know that 73% of the energy of the universe\n\n05:25.480 --> 05:27.560\n is dark energy.\n\n05:27.560 --> 05:30.640\n Dark matter represents maybe 23% or so,\n\n05:30.640 --> 05:33.040\n and we only represent 4%.\n\n05:33.040 --> 05:34.640\n We're the oddballs.\n\n05:34.640 --> 05:36.400\n And so you begin to realize that, yeah,\n\n05:36.400 --> 05:39.760\n there could be type four, maybe even type five.\n\n05:39.760 --> 05:43.280\n So type four, you're saying being able to harness\n\n05:43.280 --> 05:45.360\n sort of like dark energy,\n\n05:45.360 --> 05:47.120\n something that permeates the entire universe.\n\n05:47.120 --> 05:51.000\n So be able to plug into the entire universe\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:52.080\n as a source of energy.\n\n05:52.080 --> 05:52.920\n That's right.\n\n05:52.920 --> 05:55.680\n And dark energy is the energy of the Big Bang.\n\n05:55.680 --> 05:58.920\n It's why the galaxies are being pushed apart.\n\n05:58.920 --> 06:00.740\n It's the energy of nothing.\n\n06:00.740 --> 06:02.560\n The more nothing you have,\n\n06:02.560 --> 06:05.400\n the more dark energy that's repulsive.\n\n06:05.400 --> 06:08.960\n And so the acceleration of the universe is accelerating\n\n06:08.960 --> 06:12.560\n because the more you have, the more you can have.\n\n06:12.560 --> 06:15.780\n And that, of course, is by definition an exponential curve.\n\n06:15.780 --> 06:17.600\n It's called a de Sitter expansion,\n\n06:17.600 --> 06:20.480\n and that's the current state of the universe.\n\n06:20.480 --> 06:25.480\n And then type five, would that be able to seek\n\n06:26.800 --> 06:31.040\n energy sources somehow outside of our universe?\n\n06:31.040 --> 06:33.000\n And how crazy is that idea?\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.400\n Yeah, type five will be the multiverse.\n\n06:35.400 --> 06:36.280\n Multiverse, okay.\n\n06:36.280 --> 06:37.760\n I'm a quantum physicist,\n\n06:37.760 --> 06:40.280\n and we quantum physicists don't believe\n\n06:40.280 --> 06:42.120\n that the Big Bang happened once.\n\n06:42.120 --> 06:45.120\n That would violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\n06:45.120 --> 06:47.880\n And that means that there could be multiple bangs\n\n06:47.880 --> 06:49.360\n happening all the time.\n\n06:49.360 --> 06:52.120\n Even as we speak today,\n\n06:52.120 --> 06:56.180\n universes are being created, and that fits the data.\n\n06:56.180 --> 06:59.960\n The inflationary universe is a quantum theory.\n\n06:59.960 --> 07:02.060\n So there's a certain finite probability\n\n07:02.060 --> 07:05.120\n that universes are being created all the time.\n\n07:05.120 --> 07:08.740\n And for me, this is actually rather aesthetically pleasing\n\n07:08.740 --> 07:13.200\n because I was raised as a Presbyterian,\n\n07:13.200 --> 07:15.920\n but my parents were Buddhists.\n\n07:15.920 --> 07:19.520\n And there's two diametrically opposed ideas\n\n07:19.520 --> 07:21.080\n about the universe.\n\n07:21.080 --> 07:23.240\n In Buddhism, there's only nirvana.\n\n07:23.240 --> 07:25.160\n There's no beginning, there's no end,\n\n07:25.160 --> 07:26.940\n there's only timelessness.\n\n07:26.940 --> 07:29.960\n But in Christianity, there is the instant\n\n07:29.960 --> 07:32.760\n when God said, let there be light.\n\n07:32.760 --> 07:35.320\n In other words, an instant of creation.\n\n07:35.320 --> 07:40.160\n So I've had these two mutually exclusive ideas in my head,\n\n07:40.160 --> 07:42.760\n and I now realize that it's possible to meld them\n\n07:42.760 --> 07:44.060\n into a single theory.\n\n07:45.120 --> 07:48.640\n Either the universe had a beginning or it didn't, right?\n\n07:48.640 --> 07:49.880\n Wrong.\n\n07:49.880 --> 07:53.160\n You see, our universe had a beginning.\n\n07:53.160 --> 07:56.240\n Our universe had an instant where somebody might have said,\n\n07:56.240 --> 07:57.860\n let there be light.\n\n07:57.860 --> 08:00.340\n But there are other bubble universes out there\n\n08:00.340 --> 08:02.720\n in a bubble bath of universes.\n\n08:02.720 --> 08:07.280\n And that means that these universes are expanding\n\n08:07.280 --> 08:11.240\n into a dimension beyond our three dimensional comprehension.\n\n08:11.240 --> 08:13.080\n In other words, hyperspace.\n\n08:13.080 --> 08:16.360\n In other words, 11 dimensional hyperspace.\n\n08:16.360 --> 08:21.360\n So nirvana would be this timeless 11 dimensional hyperspace\n\n08:21.680 --> 08:24.860\n where big bangs are happening all the time.\n\n08:24.860 --> 08:28.640\n So we can now combine two mutually exclusive theories\n\n08:28.640 --> 08:29.660\n of creation.\n\n08:30.920 --> 08:35.320\n And Stephen Hawking, for example, even in his last book,\n\n08:35.320 --> 08:37.120\n even said that this is an argument\n\n08:37.120 --> 08:39.320\n against the existence of God.\n\n08:39.320 --> 08:42.680\n He said there is no God because there was not enough time\n\n08:42.680 --> 08:44.320\n for God to create the universe\n\n08:44.320 --> 08:47.800\n because the big bang happened in an instant of time.\n\n08:47.800 --> 08:50.400\n Therefore, there was no time available\n\n08:50.400 --> 08:52.360\n for him to create the universe.\n\n08:52.360 --> 08:54.600\n But you see, the multiverse idea\n\n08:54.600 --> 08:58.040\n means that there was a time before time.\n\n08:58.040 --> 09:01.920\n And there are multiple times, each bubble has its own time.\n\n09:01.920 --> 09:06.240\n And so it means that there could actually be a universe\n\n09:06.240 --> 09:09.640\n before the beginning of our universe.\n\n09:09.640 --> 09:12.620\n So if you think of a bubble bath, when two bubbles collide,\n\n09:13.640 --> 09:16.800\n or when two bubbles fission to create a baby bubble,\n\n09:16.800 --> 09:18.800\n that's called the big bang.\n\n09:18.800 --> 09:21.520\n So the big bang is nothing but the collision of universes\n\n09:21.520 --> 09:23.720\n or the budding of universes.\n\n09:23.720 --> 09:25.080\n That's such a beautiful picture\n\n09:25.080 --> 09:28.000\n of our incredibly mysterious existence.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.240\n So is that humbling to you?\n\n09:30.240 --> 09:32.840\n Exciting, the idea of multiverses?\n\n09:32.840 --> 09:35.000\n I don't even know how to even begin\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.640\n to wrap my mind around it.\n\n09:37.640 --> 09:38.480\n It's exciting for me\n\n09:38.480 --> 09:41.680\n because what I do for a living is string theory.\n\n09:41.680 --> 09:43.040\n That's my day job.\n\n09:43.040 --> 09:46.840\n I get paid by the city of New York to work on string theory.\n\n09:46.840 --> 09:50.520\n And you see, string theory is a multiverse theory.\n\n09:50.520 --> 09:53.400\n So people say, first of all, what is string theory?\n\n09:53.400 --> 09:55.640\n String theory simply says that all the particles\n\n09:55.640 --> 09:58.240\n we see in nature, the electron, the proton,\n\n09:58.240 --> 09:59.840\n the quarks, what have you,\n\n09:59.840 --> 10:03.240\n are nothing but vibrations on a musical string,\n\n10:03.240 --> 10:04.960\n on a tiny, tiny little string.\n\n10:05.920 --> 10:07.400\n You know, G. Robert Oppenheimer,\n\n10:07.400 --> 10:09.640\n the creator of the atomic bomb,\n\n10:09.640 --> 10:12.040\n was so frustrated in the 1950s\n\n10:12.040 --> 10:15.160\n with all these subatomic particles being created\n\n10:15.160 --> 10:18.240\n in our atom smashers that he announced,\n\n10:18.240 --> 10:22.680\n he announced one day that the Nobel Prize in physics\n\n10:22.680 --> 10:23.960\n should go to the physicist\n\n10:23.960 --> 10:28.280\n who does not discover a new particle that year.\n\n10:28.280 --> 10:30.600\n Well, today we think they're nothing but musical notes\n\n10:30.600 --> 10:32.960\n on these tiny little vibrating strings.\n\n10:32.960 --> 10:34.720\n So what is physics?\n\n10:34.720 --> 10:38.600\n Physics is the harmonies you can write on vibrating strings.\n\n10:38.600 --> 10:40.160\n What is chemistry?\n\n10:40.160 --> 10:44.840\n Chemistry is the melodies you can play on these strings.\n\n10:44.840 --> 10:46.160\n What is the universe?\n\n10:47.040 --> 10:50.280\n The universe is a symphony of strings.\n\n10:50.280 --> 10:53.200\n And then what is the mind of God\n\n10:53.200 --> 10:55.720\n that Albert Einstein so eloquently wrote about\n\n10:55.720 --> 10:58.400\n for the last 30 years of his life?\n\n10:58.400 --> 11:02.760\n The mind of God would be cosmic music,\n\n11:02.760 --> 11:06.160\n resonating through 11 dimensional hyperspace.\n\n11:06.160 --> 11:07.280\n So beautifully put.\n\n11:07.280 --> 11:11.880\n What do you think is the mind of Einstein's God?\n\n11:11.880 --> 11:16.160\n Do you think there's a why that we could untangle\n\n11:16.160 --> 11:19.760\n from this universe of strings?\n\n11:19.760 --> 11:20.920\n Why are we here?\n\n11:20.920 --> 11:22.400\n What is the meaning of it all?\n\n11:23.320 --> 11:26.280\n Well, Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize,\n\n11:26.280 --> 11:29.760\n once said that the more we learn about the universe,\n\n11:29.760 --> 11:32.240\n the more we learn that it's pointless.\n\n11:32.240 --> 11:35.600\n Well, I don't know.\n\n11:35.600 --> 11:37.280\n I don't profess to understand\n\n11:37.280 --> 11:39.320\n the great secrets of the universe.\n\n11:39.320 --> 11:41.120\n However, let me say two things\n\n11:41.120 --> 11:43.320\n about what the giants of physics\n\n11:43.320 --> 11:45.320\n have said about this question.\n\n11:45.320 --> 11:48.440\n Einstein believed in two types of God.\n\n11:49.320 --> 11:54.280\n One was the God of the Bible, the personal God,\n\n11:54.280 --> 11:56.560\n the God that answers prayers, walks on waters,\n\n11:56.560 --> 12:00.040\n performs miracles, smites the Philistines.\n\n12:00.040 --> 12:02.640\n That's the personal God that he didn't believe in.\n\n12:02.640 --> 12:05.480\n He believed in the God of Spinoza,\n\n12:05.480 --> 12:10.040\n the God of order, simplicity, harmony, beauty.\n\n12:10.040 --> 12:12.840\n The universe could have been ugly.\n\n12:12.840 --> 12:15.680\n The universe could have been messy, random,\n\n12:15.680 --> 12:17.360\n but it's gorgeous.\n\n12:17.360 --> 12:19.960\n You realize that on a single sheet of paper,\n\n12:19.960 --> 12:23.120\n we can write down all the known laws of the universe.\n\n12:23.120 --> 12:25.400\n It's amazing, on one sheet of paper,\n\n12:25.400 --> 12:27.840\n Einstein's equation is one inch long,\n\n12:27.840 --> 12:30.040\n string theory is a lot longer,\n\n12:30.040 --> 12:31.960\n and so it's a standard model,\n\n12:31.960 --> 12:33.880\n but you could put all these equations\n\n12:33.880 --> 12:36.000\n on one sheet of paper.\n\n12:36.880 --> 12:38.640\n It didn't have to be that way.\n\n12:38.640 --> 12:40.240\n It could have been messy.\n\n12:40.240 --> 12:43.160\n And so, Einstein thought of himself as a young boy\n\n12:43.160 --> 12:47.480\n entering this huge library for the first time,\n\n12:47.480 --> 12:51.160\n being overwhelmed by the simplicity, elegance,\n\n12:51.160 --> 12:53.160\n and beauty of this library,\n\n12:53.160 --> 12:56.560\n but all he could do was read the first page\n\n12:56.560 --> 12:58.320\n of the first volume.\n\n12:58.320 --> 13:00.320\n Well, that library is the universe,\n\n13:00.320 --> 13:03.240\n with all sorts of mysterious, magical things\n\n13:03.240 --> 13:05.280\n that we have yet to find.\n\n13:05.280 --> 13:07.920\n And then Galileo was asked about this.\n\n13:07.920 --> 13:12.920\n Galileo said that the purpose of science,\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:17.680\n the purpose of science is to determine how the heavens go.\n\n13:17.680 --> 13:20.680\n The purpose of religion is to determine\n\n13:20.680 --> 13:22.400\n how to go to heaven.\n\n13:22.400 --> 13:26.200\n So in other words, science is about natural law,\n\n13:26.200 --> 13:29.480\n and religion is about ethics,\n\n13:29.480 --> 13:32.320\n how to be a good person, how to go to heaven.\n\n13:32.320 --> 13:35.000\n As long as we keep these two things apart,\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:36.960\n we're in great shape.\n\n13:36.960 --> 13:41.080\n The problem occurs when people from the natural sciences\n\n13:41.080 --> 13:43.360\n begin to pontificate about ethics,\n\n13:43.360 --> 13:46.200\n and people from religion begin to pontificate\n\n13:46.200 --> 13:47.880\n about natural law.\n\n13:47.880 --> 13:50.800\n That's where we get into big trouble.\n\n13:50.800 --> 13:53.720\n You think they're fundamentally distinct,\n\n13:53.720 --> 13:58.360\n morality and ethics and our idea of what is right\n\n13:58.360 --> 13:59.360\n and what is wrong.\n\n13:59.360 --> 14:02.080\n That's something that's outside the reach\n\n14:02.080 --> 14:03.960\n of string theory and physics.\n\n14:03.960 --> 14:04.800\n That's right.\n\n14:04.800 --> 14:08.680\n If you talk to a squirrel about what is right\n\n14:08.680 --> 14:12.520\n and what is wrong, there's no reference frame\n\n14:12.520 --> 14:16.600\n for a squirrel, and realize that aliens from outer space,\n\n14:16.600 --> 14:20.560\n if they ever come visit us, they'll try to talk to us\n\n14:20.560 --> 14:22.520\n like we talk to squirrels in the forest,\n\n14:22.520 --> 14:25.880\n but eventually we get bored talking to the squirrels\n\n14:25.880 --> 14:28.040\n because they don't talk back to us.\n\n14:28.040 --> 14:30.000\n Same thing with aliens from outer space.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.280\n They come down to earth, they'll be curious about us\n\n14:32.280 --> 14:35.440\n to a degree, but after a while they just get bored\n\n14:35.440 --> 14:37.920\n because we have nothing to offer them.\n\n14:37.920 --> 14:40.480\n So our sense of right and wrong,\n\n14:40.480 --> 14:43.400\n what does that mean compared to a squirrel's sense\n\n14:43.400 --> 14:45.680\n of right and wrong?\n\n14:46.560 --> 14:48.720\n Now we of course do have an ethics\n\n14:48.720 --> 14:51.840\n that keeps civilizations in line,\n\n14:51.840 --> 14:56.480\n enriches our life and makes civilization possible.\n\n14:56.480 --> 14:58.040\n And I think that's a good thing,\n\n14:58.040 --> 15:01.560\n but it's not mandated by a law of physics.\n\n15:01.560 --> 15:06.560\n So if aliens do, alien species were to make contact,\n\n15:06.960 --> 15:10.040\n forgive me for staying on aliens for a bit longer.\n\n15:10.920 --> 15:15.640\n Do you think they're more likely to be friendly,\n\n15:15.640 --> 15:18.680\n to befriend us or to destroy us?\n\n15:18.680 --> 15:20.560\n Well, I think for the most part,\n\n15:20.560 --> 15:22.880\n they'll pretty much ignore us.\n\n15:22.880 --> 15:25.920\n If you're a deer in the forest, who do you fear the most?\n\n15:25.920 --> 15:30.480\n Do you fear the hunter with his gigantic 16 gauge shotgun?\n\n15:30.480 --> 15:35.400\n Or do you fear the guy with a briefcase and glasses?\n\n15:35.400 --> 15:39.040\n Well, the guy with the briefcase could be a developer\n\n15:39.040 --> 15:42.400\n about to basically flatten the entire forest,\n\n15:42.400 --> 15:44.200\n destroying your livelihood.\n\n15:44.200 --> 15:47.720\n So instinctively you may be afraid of the hunter,\n\n15:47.720 --> 15:51.320\n but actually the problem with deers in the forest\n\n15:51.320 --> 15:54.160\n is that they should fear developers\n\n15:54.160 --> 15:57.360\n because developers look at deer as simply\n\n15:57.360 --> 15:59.440\n getting in the way.\n\n15:59.440 --> 16:02.560\n I mean, in War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells,\n\n16:02.560 --> 16:04.760\n the aliens did not hate us.\n\n16:04.760 --> 16:05.960\n If you read the book,\n\n16:05.960 --> 16:10.960\n the aliens did not have evil intentions toward homo sapiens.\n\n16:11.360 --> 16:13.560\n No, we were in the way.\n\n16:13.560 --> 16:18.000\n So I think we have to realize that alien civilizations\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:21.080\n may view us quite differently than in science fiction novels.\n\n16:21.080 --> 16:22.800\n However, I personally believe,\n\n16:22.800 --> 16:24.560\n and I cannot prove any of this,\n\n16:24.560 --> 16:27.320\n I personally believe that they're probably gonna be peaceful\n\n16:27.320 --> 16:31.720\n because there's nothing that they want from our world.\n\n16:31.720 --> 16:33.360\n I mean, what are they gonna take us?\n\n16:33.360 --> 16:35.360\n What are they gonna take us for, gold?\n\n16:35.360 --> 16:39.360\n No, gold is a useless metal for the most part.\n\n16:39.360 --> 16:43.600\n It's silver, I mean, it's gold in color,\n\n16:43.600 --> 16:45.640\n but that only affects homo sapiens.\n\n16:45.640 --> 16:47.760\n Squirrels don't care about gold.\n\n16:47.760 --> 16:50.560\n And so gold is a rather useless element.\n\n16:50.560 --> 16:53.160\n Rare earths maybe, platinum based elements,\n\n16:53.160 --> 16:55.720\n rare earths for the electronics, yeah, maybe.\n\n16:55.720 --> 16:59.280\n But other than that, we have nothing to offer them.\n\n16:59.280 --> 17:01.640\n I mean, think about it for a moment.\n\n17:01.640 --> 17:06.560\n People love Shakespeare and they love the arts and poetry,\n\n17:06.560 --> 17:10.200\n but outside of the earth, they mean nothing,\n\n17:10.200 --> 17:12.320\n absolutely nothing.\n\n17:12.320 --> 17:15.800\n I mean, when I write down an equation in string theory,\n\n17:15.800 --> 17:19.760\n I would hope that on the other side of the galaxy,\n\n17:19.760 --> 17:22.880\n there's an alien writing down that very same equation\n\n17:22.880 --> 17:24.720\n in different notation,\n\n17:24.720 --> 17:27.240\n but that alien on the other side of the galaxy,\n\n17:27.240 --> 17:30.360\n Shakespeare, poetry, Hemingway,\n\n17:30.360 --> 17:33.960\n it would mean nothing to him or her or it.\n\n17:33.960 --> 17:38.080\n When you think about entities that's out there,\n\n17:38.080 --> 17:43.080\n extraterrestrial, do you think they would naturally look\n\n17:43.880 --> 17:48.000\n something that even is recognizable to us as life?\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.560\n Or would they be radically different?\n\n17:50.560 --> 17:52.840\n Well, how did we become intelligent?\n\n17:52.840 --> 17:56.160\n Basically three things made us intelligent.\n\n17:56.160 --> 17:59.320\n One is our eyesight, stereo eyesight.\n\n17:59.320 --> 18:01.160\n We have the eyes of a hunter,\n\n18:01.160 --> 18:04.240\n stereo vision so we lock in on targets.\n\n18:04.240 --> 18:09.240\n And who is smarter, predator or prey?\n\n18:09.360 --> 18:11.560\n Predators are smarter than prey.\n\n18:11.560 --> 18:13.240\n They have their eyes at the front of their face,\n\n18:13.240 --> 18:14.800\n like lions, tigers,\n\n18:15.680 --> 18:18.800\n while rabbits have eyes to the side of their face.\n\n18:18.800 --> 18:19.840\n Why is that?\n\n18:19.840 --> 18:22.720\n Hunters have to zero in on the target.\n\n18:22.720 --> 18:24.560\n They have to know how to ambush.\n\n18:24.560 --> 18:27.000\n They have to know how to hide, camouflage,\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:30.160\n sneak up, stealth, deceit.\n\n18:30.160 --> 18:31.960\n That takes a lot of intelligence.\n\n18:31.960 --> 18:35.200\n Rabbits, all they have to do is run.\n\n18:35.200 --> 18:39.880\n So that's the first criterion, stereo eyesight of some sort.\n\n18:39.880 --> 18:42.760\n Second is the thumb.\n\n18:42.760 --> 18:44.640\n The opposable thumb of some sort\n\n18:44.640 --> 18:46.120\n could be a claw or a tentacle.\n\n18:46.120 --> 18:48.640\n So hand eye coordination.\n\n18:48.640 --> 18:50.240\n Hand eye coordination is the way\n\n18:50.240 --> 18:52.800\n we manipulate the environment.\n\n18:52.800 --> 18:55.040\n And then three, language.\n\n18:55.040 --> 18:58.200\n Because mama bear never tells baby bear\n\n18:58.200 --> 19:00.360\n to avoid the human hunter.\n\n19:00.360 --> 19:02.360\n Bears just learn by themselves.\n\n19:02.360 --> 19:04.040\n They never hand out information\n\n19:04.040 --> 19:06.240\n from one generation to the next.\n\n19:06.240 --> 19:09.160\n So these are the three basic ingredients of intelligence.\n\n19:10.200 --> 19:12.960\n Eyesight of some sort, an opposable thumb\n\n19:12.960 --> 19:16.640\n or tentacle or claw of some sort, and language.\n\n19:16.640 --> 19:19.080\n Now ask yourself a simple question.\n\n19:19.080 --> 19:22.400\n How many animals have all three?\n\n19:22.400 --> 19:23.480\n Just us.\n\n19:23.480 --> 19:25.200\n It's just us.\n\n19:25.200 --> 19:28.440\n I mean, the primates, they have a language, yeah,\n\n19:28.440 --> 19:30.720\n they may get up to maybe 20 words,\n\n19:30.720 --> 19:32.720\n but a baby learns a word a day,\n\n19:32.720 --> 19:35.120\n several words a day a baby learns.\n\n19:35.120 --> 19:40.120\n And a typical adult knows about almost 5,000 words.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:42.800\n While the maximum number of words\n\n19:42.800 --> 19:46.600\n that you can teach a gorilla in any language,\n\n19:46.600 --> 19:49.680\n including their own language, is about 20 or so.\n\n19:49.680 --> 19:53.080\n And so we see the difference in intelligence.\n\n19:53.080 --> 19:55.560\n So when we meet aliens from outer space,\n\n19:55.560 --> 19:58.040\n chances are they will have been descended\n\n19:58.040 --> 20:01.040\n from predators of some sort.\n\n20:01.040 --> 20:03.440\n They'll have some way to manipulate the environment\n\n20:03.440 --> 20:07.000\n and communicate their knowledge to the next generation.\n\n20:07.840 --> 20:09.000\n That's it, folks.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:12.400\n So functionally, that would be similar.\n\n20:12.400 --> 20:15.880\n That would, we would be able to recognize them.\n\n20:15.880 --> 20:17.920\n Well, not necessarily, because I think\n\n20:17.920 --> 20:20.960\n even with Homo sapiens, we are eventually\n\n20:20.960 --> 20:24.760\n going to perhaps become part cybernetic\n\n20:24.760 --> 20:26.640\n and genetically enhanced.\n\n20:27.960 --> 20:31.520\n Already, robots are getting smarter and smarter.\n\n20:31.520 --> 20:35.720\n Right now, robots have the intelligence of a cockroach.\n\n20:35.720 --> 20:37.280\n But in the coming years,\n\n20:37.280 --> 20:40.480\n our robots will be as smart as a mouse,\n\n20:40.480 --> 20:42.840\n then maybe as smart as a rabbit.\n\n20:42.840 --> 20:47.200\n If we're lucky, maybe as smart as a cat or a dog.\n\n20:47.200 --> 20:50.200\n And by the end of the century, who knows for sure,\n\n20:50.200 --> 20:53.680\n our robots will be probably as smart as a monkey.\n\n20:53.680 --> 20:56.960\n Now, at that point, of course, they could be dangerous.\n\n20:56.960 --> 20:59.720\n You see, monkeys are self aware.\n\n20:59.720 --> 21:03.320\n They know they are monkeys.\n\n21:03.320 --> 21:06.160\n They may have a different agenda than us.\n\n21:06.160 --> 21:09.560\n While dogs, dogs are confused.\n\n21:10.600 --> 21:14.760\n You see, dogs think that we are a dog,\n\n21:14.760 --> 21:16.360\n that we're the top dog.\n\n21:16.360 --> 21:17.480\n They're the underdog.\n\n21:17.480 --> 21:20.200\n That's why they whimper and follow us and lick us\n\n21:20.200 --> 21:21.320\n all the time.\n\n21:21.320 --> 21:22.920\n We're the top dog.\n\n21:22.920 --> 21:25.440\n Monkeys have no illusion at all.\n\n21:25.440 --> 21:28.280\n They know we are not monkeys.\n\n21:28.280 --> 21:29.960\n And so I think that in the future,\n\n21:29.960 --> 21:32.960\n we'll have to put a chip in their brain to shut them off\n\n21:32.960 --> 21:35.480\n once our robots have murderous thoughts.\n\n21:35.480 --> 21:37.480\n But that's in a hundred years.\n\n21:37.480 --> 21:41.520\n In 200 years, the robots will be smart enough\n\n21:41.520 --> 21:44.640\n to remove that fail safe chip in their brain\n\n21:44.640 --> 21:46.840\n and then watch out.\n\n21:46.840 --> 21:51.840\n At that point, I think rather than compete with our robots,\n\n21:52.600 --> 21:53.840\n we should merge with them.\n\n21:54.800 --> 21:56.800\n We should become part cybernetic.\n\n21:56.800 --> 21:59.480\n So I think when we meet alien life from outer space,\n\n21:59.480 --> 22:04.480\n they may be genetically and cybernetically enhanced.\n\n22:05.360 --> 22:07.720\n Genetically and cybernetically enhanced.\n\n22:07.720 --> 22:11.040\n Wow, so let's talk about that full range.\n\n22:11.040 --> 22:13.720\n In the near term and 200 years from now,\n\n22:13.720 --> 22:16.920\n how promising in the near term in your view\n\n22:16.920 --> 22:18.760\n is brain machine interfaces?\n\n22:18.760 --> 22:22.920\n So starting to allow computers to talk directly\n\n22:22.920 --> 22:26.880\n to the brains, Elon Musk is working on that with Neuralink\n\n22:26.880 --> 22:29.000\n and there's other companies working on this idea.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:30.480\n Do you see promise there?\n\n22:30.480 --> 22:32.960\n Do you see hope for near term impact?\n\n22:32.960 --> 22:36.400\n Well, every technology has pluses and minuses.\n\n22:36.400 --> 22:38.600\n Already we can record memories.\n\n22:38.600 --> 22:40.920\n I have a book, The Future of the Mind,\n\n22:40.920 --> 22:42.840\n where I detail some of these breakthroughs.\n\n22:42.840 --> 22:46.360\n We can now record simple memories of mice\n\n22:46.360 --> 22:49.320\n and send these memories on the internet.\n\n22:49.320 --> 22:52.080\n Eventually, we're gonna do this with primates\n\n22:52.080 --> 22:55.960\n at Wake Forest University and also in Los Angeles.\n\n22:55.960 --> 22:57.720\n And then after that,\n\n22:57.720 --> 23:00.880\n we'll have a memory chip for Alzheimer's patients.\n\n23:00.880 --> 23:02.840\n We'll test it out in Alzheimer's patients\n\n23:02.840 --> 23:05.800\n because of course, when Alzheimer's patients\n\n23:05.800 --> 23:07.760\n lose their memory, they wander.\n\n23:07.760 --> 23:11.680\n They create all sorts of havoc, wandering around,\n\n23:11.680 --> 23:15.640\n oblivious to their surroundings and they'll have a chip.\n\n23:15.640 --> 23:18.240\n They'll push the button and memories,\n\n23:18.240 --> 23:21.120\n memories will come flooding into their hippocampus\n\n23:21.120 --> 23:26.120\n and the chip telling them where they live and who they are.\n\n23:26.280 --> 23:29.520\n And so a memory chip is definitely in the cards.\n\n23:29.520 --> 23:33.200\n And I think this will eventually affect human civilization.\n\n23:33.200 --> 23:35.080\n What is the future of the internet?\n\n23:35.080 --> 23:37.680\n The future of the internet is brain net.\n\n23:37.680 --> 23:41.680\n Brain net is when we send emotions, feelings,\n\n23:41.680 --> 23:44.400\n sensations on the internet.\n\n23:44.400 --> 23:46.640\n And we will telepathically communicate\n\n23:46.640 --> 23:49.600\n with other humans this way.\n\n23:49.600 --> 23:51.160\n This is gonna affect everything.\n\n23:51.160 --> 23:52.480\n Look at entertainment.\n\n23:52.480 --> 23:54.080\n Remember the silent movies?\n\n23:54.080 --> 23:56.240\n Charlie Chaplin was very famous\n\n23:56.240 --> 23:58.040\n during the era of silent movies.\n\n23:58.040 --> 23:59.960\n But when the talkies came in,\n\n23:59.960 --> 24:03.000\n nobody wanted to see Charlie Chaplin anymore\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.640\n because he never talked in the movies.\n\n24:05.640 --> 24:08.880\n And so a whole generation of actors lost their job\n\n24:08.880 --> 24:11.400\n and a new series of actors came in.\n\n24:11.400 --> 24:16.400\n Next, we're gonna have the movies replaced by brain net\n\n24:16.960 --> 24:19.480\n because in the future, people will say,\n\n24:19.480 --> 24:23.120\n who wants to see a screen with images?\n\n24:23.120 --> 24:23.960\n That's it.\n\n24:23.960 --> 24:27.320\n Sound and image, that's called the movies.\n\n24:27.320 --> 24:28.960\n In our entertainment industry,\n\n24:28.960 --> 24:32.240\n this multi billion dollar industry is based on screens\n\n24:32.240 --> 24:34.680\n with moving images and sound.\n\n24:34.680 --> 24:39.680\n But what happens when emotions, feelings, sensations,\n\n24:39.920 --> 24:43.200\n memories can be conveyed on the internet?\n\n24:43.200 --> 24:44.800\n It's gonna change everything.\n\n24:44.800 --> 24:46.280\n Human relations will change\n\n24:46.280 --> 24:47.720\n because you'll be able to empathize\n\n24:47.720 --> 24:50.280\n and feel the suffering of other people.\n\n24:50.280 --> 24:53.280\n We'll be able to communicate telepathically.\n\n24:53.280 --> 24:55.880\n And this is coming.\n\n24:55.880 --> 24:58.640\n You described brain net and future of the mind.\n\n24:58.640 --> 25:00.960\n This is an interesting concept.\n\n25:00.960 --> 25:03.920\n Do you think, so you mentioned entertainment,\n\n25:03.920 --> 25:06.200\n but what kind of effect would it have\n\n25:06.200 --> 25:08.600\n on our personal relationships?\n\n25:08.600 --> 25:10.360\n Hopefully it will deepen it.\n\n25:10.360 --> 25:13.360\n You realize that for most of human history,\n\n25:13.360 --> 25:16.760\n for over 90% of human history,\n\n25:16.760 --> 25:21.760\n we only knew maybe 20, 100 people.\n\n25:22.040 --> 25:23.520\n That's it, folks.\n\n25:23.520 --> 25:25.000\n That was your tribe.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:28.400\n That was everybody you knew in the universe\n\n25:28.400 --> 25:31.720\n was only maybe 50 or 100.\n\n25:31.720 --> 25:33.240\n With the coming of towns,\n\n25:33.240 --> 25:35.640\n of course it expanded to a few thousand.\n\n25:35.640 --> 25:37.480\n With the coming of the telephone,\n\n25:37.480 --> 25:40.520\n all of a sudden you could reach thousands of people\n\n25:40.520 --> 25:41.600\n with a telephone.\n\n25:41.600 --> 25:42.680\n And now with the internet,\n\n25:42.680 --> 25:45.520\n you can reach the entire population of the planet Earth.\n\n25:45.520 --> 25:48.400\n And so I think this is a normal progression.\n\n25:48.400 --> 25:52.320\n And you think that kind of sort of connection\n\n25:52.320 --> 25:53.920\n to the rest of the world,\n\n25:53.920 --> 25:55.360\n and then adding sensations\n\n25:55.360 --> 25:58.880\n like being able to share telepathically emotions and so on\n\n25:58.880 --> 26:01.160\n that would just further deepen our connection\n\n26:01.160 --> 26:02.920\n to our fellow humans.\n\n26:02.920 --> 26:03.760\n That's right.\n\n26:03.760 --> 26:07.680\n In fact, I disagree with many scientists on this question.\n\n26:07.680 --> 26:11.200\n Most scientists would say that technology is neutral.\n\n26:11.200 --> 26:12.600\n A double edged sword,\n\n26:12.600 --> 26:15.960\n one side of the sword can cut against people.\n\n26:15.960 --> 26:17.360\n The other side of the sword\n\n26:17.360 --> 26:20.840\n can cut against ignorance and disease.\n\n26:20.840 --> 26:22.440\n I disagree.\n\n26:22.440 --> 26:25.920\n I think technology does have a moral direction.\n\n26:25.920 --> 26:27.360\n Look at the internet.\n\n26:27.360 --> 26:30.680\n The internet spreads knowledge, awareness,\n\n26:30.680 --> 26:33.040\n and that creates empowerment.\n\n26:33.040 --> 26:35.400\n People act on knowledge.\n\n26:35.400 --> 26:36.760\n When they begin to realize\n\n26:36.760 --> 26:38.520\n that they don't have to live that way,\n\n26:38.520 --> 26:41.080\n they don't have to suffer under a dictatorship,\n\n26:41.080 --> 26:44.560\n that there are other ways of living under freedom,\n\n26:44.560 --> 26:47.720\n then they begin to take things, take power.\n\n26:47.720 --> 26:49.600\n And that spreads democracy.\n\n26:49.600 --> 26:54.240\n And democracies do not war with other democracies.\n\n26:54.240 --> 26:55.240\n I'm a scientist.\n\n26:55.240 --> 26:57.160\n I believe in data.\n\n26:57.160 --> 26:59.080\n So let's take a sheet of paper\n\n26:59.080 --> 27:03.760\n and write down every single war you had to learn\n\n27:03.760 --> 27:05.880\n since you were in elementary school.\n\n27:05.880 --> 27:07.800\n Every single war, hundreds of them.\n\n27:07.800 --> 27:11.040\n Kings, queens, emperors, dictators.\n\n27:11.040 --> 27:13.600\n All these wars were between kings, queens,\n\n27:13.600 --> 27:15.240\n emperors, and dictators.\n\n27:15.240 --> 27:19.840\n Never between two major democracies.\n\n27:19.840 --> 27:22.560\n And so I think with the spread of this technology\n\n27:22.560 --> 27:26.120\n and which would accelerate with the coming of brain net,\n\n27:26.120 --> 27:28.480\n it means that, well, we will still have wars.\n\n27:28.480 --> 27:31.520\n Wars, of course, is politics by other means,\n\n27:31.520 --> 27:34.440\n but they'll be less intense and less frequent.\n\n27:35.440 --> 27:40.440\n Do you have worries of longer term existential risk\n\n27:40.960 --> 27:43.440\n from technology, from AI?\n\n27:43.440 --> 27:48.120\n So I think that's a wonderful vision of a future\n\n27:48.120 --> 27:51.200\n where war is a distant memory,\n\n27:51.200 --> 27:53.840\n but now there's another agent.\n\n27:53.840 --> 27:57.920\n There's somebody else that's able to create conflict,\n\n27:57.920 --> 28:00.920\n that's able to create harm, AI systems.\n\n28:00.920 --> 28:03.080\n So do you have worry about such AI systems?\n\n28:03.080 --> 28:05.440\n Well, yes, that is an existential risk,\n\n28:05.440 --> 28:07.760\n but again, I think an existential risk,\n\n28:07.760 --> 28:09.800\n not for this century.\n\n28:09.800 --> 28:12.520\n I think our grandkids are gonna have to confront\n\n28:12.520 --> 28:15.160\n this question as robots gradually approach\n\n28:15.160 --> 28:17.840\n the intelligence of a dog, a cat,\n\n28:17.840 --> 28:20.440\n and finally that of a monkey.\n\n28:20.440 --> 28:23.760\n However, I think we will digitize ourselves as well.\n\n28:23.760 --> 28:26.160\n Not only are we gonna merge with our technology,\n\n28:26.160 --> 28:28.560\n we'll also digitize our personality,\n\n28:28.560 --> 28:30.680\n our memories, our feelings.\n\n28:30.680 --> 28:32.560\n You realize during the Middle Ages,\n\n28:32.560 --> 28:34.680\n there was something called dualism.\n\n28:34.680 --> 28:38.200\n Dualism meant that the soul was separate from the body.\n\n28:38.200 --> 28:40.920\n When the body died, the soul went to heaven.\n\n28:40.920 --> 28:42.440\n That's dualism.\n\n28:42.440 --> 28:45.440\n Then in the 20th century, neuroscience came in\n\n28:45.440 --> 28:47.720\n and said, bah, humbug.\n\n28:47.720 --> 28:50.920\n Every time we look at the brain, it's just neurons.\n\n28:50.920 --> 28:54.640\n That's it, folks, period, end of story.\n\n28:54.640 --> 28:56.840\n Bunch of neurons firing.\n\n28:56.840 --> 28:59.640\n Now we're going back to dualism.\n\n28:59.640 --> 29:03.440\n Now we realize that we can digitize human memories,\n\n29:03.440 --> 29:08.440\n feelings, sensations, and create a digital copy of ourselves,\n\n29:09.040 --> 29:11.600\n and that's called the Connectome Project.\n\n29:11.600 --> 29:14.320\n Billions of dollars are now being spent\n\n29:14.320 --> 29:17.320\n to do not just the genome project\n\n29:17.320 --> 29:19.680\n of sequencing the genes of our body,\n\n29:19.680 --> 29:21.640\n but the Connectome Project,\n\n29:21.640 --> 29:26.120\n which is to map the entire connections of the human brain.\n\n29:26.120 --> 29:28.920\n And even before then, already in Silicon Valley,\n\n29:28.920 --> 29:31.320\n today, at this very moment,\n\n29:31.320 --> 29:33.480\n you can contact Silicon Valley companies\n\n29:33.480 --> 29:36.800\n that are willing to digitize your relatives\n\n29:36.800 --> 29:39.760\n because some people want to talk to their parents.\n\n29:39.760 --> 29:42.400\n There are unresolved issues with their parents,\n\n29:42.400 --> 29:45.800\n and one day, yes, firms will digitize people,\n\n29:45.800 --> 29:49.280\n and you'll be able to talk to them a reasonable facsimile.\n\n29:49.280 --> 29:52.440\n We leave a digital trail.\n\n29:52.440 --> 29:54.080\n Our ancestors did not.\n\n29:54.080 --> 29:57.600\n Our ancestors were lucky if they had one line,\n\n29:57.600 --> 30:00.720\n just one line in a church book,\n\n30:00.720 --> 30:04.400\n saying the date they were baptized and the date they died.\n\n30:04.400 --> 30:05.280\n That's it.\n\n30:05.280 --> 30:08.200\n That was their entire digital memory.\n\n30:08.200 --> 30:11.520\n I mean, their entire digital existence summarized\n\n30:11.520 --> 30:15.960\n in just a few letters of the alphabet, a whole life.\n\n30:15.960 --> 30:17.960\n Now we digitize everything.\n\n30:17.960 --> 30:20.320\n Every time you sneeze, you digitize it.\n\n30:20.320 --> 30:21.720\n You put it on the internet.\n\n30:22.800 --> 30:25.440\n And so I think that we are gonna digitize ourselves\n\n30:25.440 --> 30:28.000\n and give us digital immortality.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:31.280\n We'll not only have biologic genetic immortality\n\n30:31.280 --> 30:34.880\n of some sort, but also digital immortality.\n\n30:34.880 --> 30:37.080\n And what are we gonna do with it?\n\n30:37.080 --> 30:39.800\n I think we should send it into outer space.\n\n30:40.880 --> 30:43.080\n If you digitize the human brain\n\n30:43.080 --> 30:46.600\n and put it on a laser beam and shoot it to the moon,\n\n30:46.600 --> 30:48.840\n you're on the moon in one second.\n\n30:48.840 --> 30:51.960\n Shoot it to Mars, you're on Mars in 20 minutes.\n\n30:51.960 --> 30:54.800\n Shoot it to Pluto, you're on Pluto in eight hours.\n\n30:54.800 --> 30:56.160\n Think about it for a moment.\n\n30:56.160 --> 30:58.480\n You can have breakfast in New York\n\n30:58.480 --> 31:02.000\n and for a morning snack, vacation on the moon,\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:05.560\n then zap your way to Mars by noontime,\n\n31:05.560 --> 31:08.520\n journey through the asteroid belt of the afternoon,\n\n31:08.520 --> 31:11.960\n and then come back for dinner in New York at night.\n\n31:11.960 --> 31:16.120\n All in a day's work at the speed of light.\n\n31:16.120 --> 31:19.680\n Now, this means that you don't need booster rockets.\n\n31:19.680 --> 31:21.720\n You don't need weightlessness problems.\n\n31:21.720 --> 31:23.760\n You don't need to worry about meteorites.\n\n31:23.760 --> 31:25.320\n And what's on the moon?\n\n31:25.320 --> 31:27.360\n On the moon, there is a mainframe\n\n31:27.360 --> 31:30.200\n that downloads your laser beam's information.\n\n31:31.080 --> 31:34.000\n And where does it download the information into?\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:35.760\n An avatar.\n\n31:35.760 --> 31:37.800\n Now, what does that avatar look like?\n\n31:37.800 --> 31:40.960\n Anything you want.\n\n31:40.960 --> 31:41.920\n Think about it for a moment.\n\n31:41.920 --> 31:46.920\n You could be Superman, Superwoman, on the moon, on Mars,\n\n31:47.400 --> 31:50.840\n traveling throughout the universe at the speed of light,\n\n31:50.840 --> 31:55.240\n downloading your personality into any vehicle you want.\n\n31:55.240 --> 31:57.200\n Now, let me stick my neck out.\n\n31:57.200 --> 31:58.960\n So far, everything I've been saying\n\n31:58.960 --> 32:00.800\n is well within the laws of physics.\n\n32:00.800 --> 32:02.480\n Well within the laws of physics.\n\n32:02.480 --> 32:04.760\n Now, let me go outside the laws of physics again.\n\n32:04.760 --> 32:05.920\n Here we go.\n\n32:05.920 --> 32:08.840\n I think this already exists.\n\n32:08.840 --> 32:11.880\n I think outside the Earth, there could be a super highway\n\n32:11.880 --> 32:14.760\n a laser highway of laser porting\n\n32:14.760 --> 32:17.560\n with billions of souls of aliens\n\n32:17.560 --> 32:20.880\n zapping their way across the galaxy.\n\n32:20.880 --> 32:22.680\n Now, let me ask you a question.\n\n32:22.680 --> 32:25.280\n Are we smart enough to determine\n\n32:25.280 --> 32:28.280\n whether such a thing exists or not?\n\n32:28.280 --> 32:31.200\n No, this could exist right outside\n\n32:31.200 --> 32:32.960\n the orbit of the planet Earth.\n\n32:32.960 --> 32:35.680\n And we're too stupid in our technology\n\n32:35.680 --> 32:38.760\n to even prove it or disprove it.\n\n32:38.760 --> 32:43.520\n We would need the aliens on this laser super highway\n\n32:43.520 --> 32:48.520\n to help us out, to send us a human interpretable signal.\n\n32:50.640 --> 32:51.920\n I mean, it ultimately boils down\n\n32:51.920 --> 32:53.320\n to the language of communication,\n\n32:53.320 --> 32:55.000\n but that's an exciting possibility\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:59.080\n that actually the sky is filled with aliens.\n\n32:59.080 --> 33:00.760\n The aliens could already be here.\n\n33:00.760 --> 33:05.360\n And we're just so oblivious that we're too stupid to know it.\n\n33:05.360 --> 33:07.280\n See, they don't have to be in alien form\n\n33:07.280 --> 33:09.720\n with little green men.\n\n33:09.720 --> 33:11.480\n They can be in any form they want\n\n33:11.480 --> 33:13.280\n in an avatar of their creation.\n\n33:13.280 --> 33:16.240\n Well, in fact, they could very well be.\n\n33:16.240 --> 33:17.320\n They can even look like us.\n\n33:17.320 --> 33:18.160\n Exactly.\n\n33:18.160 --> 33:19.000\n We'd never know.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.240\n One of us could be an alien.\n\n33:21.240 --> 33:22.720\n You know, in the zoo, did you know\n\n33:22.720 --> 33:26.360\n that we sometimes have zookeepers that imitate animals?\n\n33:26.360 --> 33:29.240\n We create a fake animal and we put it in\n\n33:29.240 --> 33:33.480\n so that the animal is not afraid of this fake animal.\n\n33:33.480 --> 33:35.080\n And of course, these animals brains,\n\n33:35.080 --> 33:37.080\n their brain is about as big as a walnut.\n\n33:37.080 --> 33:40.680\n They accept these dummies as if they were real.\n\n33:41.680 --> 33:44.160\n So an alien civilization in outer space would say,\n\n33:44.160 --> 33:46.480\n oh yeah, human brains are so tiny.\n\n33:46.480 --> 33:49.240\n We could put a dummy on their world, an avatar,\n\n33:49.240 --> 33:50.680\n and they'd never know it.\n\n33:51.680 --> 33:53.400\n That would be an entertaining thing to watch\n\n33:53.400 --> 33:55.040\n from the alien perspective.\n\n33:55.040 --> 33:58.880\n So you kind of implied that with a digital form\n\n33:58.880 --> 34:02.280\n of our being, but also biologically,\n\n34:02.280 --> 34:04.560\n do you think one day technology will allow\n\n34:04.560 --> 34:07.600\n individual human beings to become immortal\n\n34:07.600 --> 34:11.560\n besides just through the ability to digitize our essence?\n\n34:11.560 --> 34:13.640\n Yeah, I think that artificial intelligence\n\n34:13.640 --> 34:17.160\n will give us the key to genetic immortality.\n\n34:17.160 --> 34:18.880\n You see, in the coming decades,\n\n34:18.880 --> 34:21.280\n everyone's gonna have their gene sequence.\n\n34:21.280 --> 34:24.160\n We'll have billions of genomes of old people,\n\n34:24.160 --> 34:26.760\n billions of genomes of young people.\n\n34:26.760 --> 34:28.200\n And what are we gonna do with it?\n\n34:28.200 --> 34:30.120\n We're gonna run it through an AI machine,\n\n34:30.120 --> 34:35.080\n which has pattern recognition, to look for the age genes.\n\n34:35.080 --> 34:38.480\n In other words, the fountain of youth that emperors,\n\n34:38.480 --> 34:41.920\n kings, and queens lusted over.\n\n34:41.920 --> 34:44.040\n The fountain of youth will be found\n\n34:44.040 --> 34:46.160\n by artificial intelligence.\n\n34:46.160 --> 34:48.800\n Artificial intelligence will identify\n\n34:48.800 --> 34:52.200\n where these age genes are located.\n\n34:52.200 --> 34:53.800\n First of all, what is aging?\n\n34:53.800 --> 34:55.840\n We now know what aging is.\n\n34:55.840 --> 34:59.680\n Aging is the buildup of errors.\n\n34:59.680 --> 35:03.560\n That's all aging is, the buildup of genetic errors.\n\n35:03.560 --> 35:07.360\n This means that cells eventually become slower, sluggish,\n\n35:07.360 --> 35:10.480\n they go into senescence, and they die.\n\n35:10.480 --> 35:13.720\n In fact, that's why we die.\n\n35:13.720 --> 35:16.840\n We die because of the buildup of mistakes\n\n35:16.840 --> 35:20.720\n in our genome, in our cellular activity.\n\n35:20.720 --> 35:23.120\n But you see, in the future, we'll be able to fix those genes\n\n35:23.120 --> 35:25.440\n with CRISPR type technologies,\n\n35:25.440 --> 35:27.400\n and perhaps even live forever.\n\n35:27.400 --> 35:29.160\n So let me ask you a question.\n\n35:29.160 --> 35:32.120\n Where does aging take place in a car?\n\n35:32.120 --> 35:34.640\n Given a car, where does aging take place?\n\n35:34.640 --> 35:37.520\n Well, it's obvious, the engine, right?\n\n35:37.520 --> 35:39.960\n A, that's where you have a lot of moving parts.\n\n35:39.960 --> 35:41.760\n B, that's where you have combustion.\n\n35:41.760 --> 35:46.760\n Well, where in the cell do we have combustion?\n\n35:47.160 --> 35:48.760\n The mitochondria.\n\n35:48.760 --> 35:52.000\n We now know where aging takes place.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:55.000\n And if we cure many of the mistakes that build up\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:59.360\n in the mitochondria of the cell, we could become immortal.\n\n35:59.360 --> 36:03.400\n Let me ask you, if you yourself could become immortal,\n\n36:03.400 --> 36:04.240\n would you?\n\n36:06.280 --> 36:07.120\n Damn straight.\n\n36:07.120 --> 36:10.280\n No, I think about it for a while,\n\n36:10.280 --> 36:14.880\n because of course, it depends on how you become immortal.\n\n36:14.880 --> 36:17.560\n You know, there's a famous myth of Tithonus.\n\n36:17.560 --> 36:21.640\n It turns out that years ago, in the Greek mythology,\n\n36:21.640 --> 36:25.280\n there was the saga of Tithonus and Aurora.\n\n36:25.280 --> 36:28.360\n Aurora was the goddess of the dawn,\n\n36:28.360 --> 36:32.120\n and she fell in love with a mortal, a human called Tithonus.\n\n36:32.120 --> 36:37.120\n And so Aurora begged Zeus to grant her\n\n36:37.440 --> 36:42.240\n the gift of immortality to give to her lover.\n\n36:42.240 --> 36:47.080\n So Zeus took pity on Aurora and made Tithonus immortal.\n\n36:47.080 --> 36:49.600\n But you see, Aurora made a mistake,\n\n36:49.600 --> 36:52.440\n a huge mistake.\n\n36:52.440 --> 36:54.800\n She asked for immortality,\n\n36:54.800 --> 36:58.000\n but she forgot to ask for eternal youth.\n\n36:59.160 --> 37:03.520\n So poor Tithonus got older and older and older every year,\n\n37:03.520 --> 37:08.520\n decrepit, a bag of bones, but he could never die.\n\n37:08.600 --> 37:09.440\n Never die.\n\n37:09.440 --> 37:11.600\n Quality of life is important.\n\n37:11.600 --> 37:14.640\n So I think immortality is a great idea,\n\n37:14.640 --> 37:18.120\n as long as you also have immortal youth as well.\n\n37:18.120 --> 37:20.800\n Now, I personally believe, and I cannot prove this,\n\n37:20.800 --> 37:22.680\n but I personally believe that our grandkids\n\n37:22.680 --> 37:26.200\n may have the option of reaching the age of 30\n\n37:26.200 --> 37:28.240\n and then stopping.\n\n37:28.240 --> 37:30.880\n They may like being age 30,\n\n37:30.880 --> 37:32.400\n because you have wisdom,\n\n37:32.400 --> 37:35.720\n you have all the benefits of age and maturity,\n\n37:35.720 --> 37:39.280\n and you still live forever with a healthy body.\n\n37:39.280 --> 37:43.240\n Our descendants may like being 30 for several centuries.\n\n37:43.240 --> 37:45.280\n Is there an aspect of human existence\n\n37:45.280 --> 37:48.200\n that is meaningful only because we're mortal?\n\n37:49.520 --> 37:52.120\n Well, every waking moment,\n\n37:52.120 --> 37:53.880\n we don't think about it this way,\n\n37:53.880 --> 37:55.200\n but every waking moment,\n\n37:55.200 --> 38:00.200\n actually, we are aware of our death and our mortality.\n\n38:00.240 --> 38:01.280\n Think about it for a moment.\n\n38:01.280 --> 38:03.320\n When you go to college,\n\n38:03.320 --> 38:05.880\n you realize that you are in a period of time\n\n38:05.880 --> 38:10.320\n where soon you will reach middle age and have a career.\n\n38:10.320 --> 38:13.840\n And after that, you'll retire and then you'll die.\n\n38:13.840 --> 38:17.280\n And so even as a youth, even as a child,\n\n38:17.280 --> 38:19.560\n without even thinking about it,\n\n38:19.560 --> 38:21.840\n you are aware of your own death,\n\n38:21.840 --> 38:24.680\n because it sets limits to your lifespan.\n\n38:24.680 --> 38:26.240\n I gotta graduate from high school.\n\n38:26.240 --> 38:27.840\n I gotta graduate from college.\n\n38:27.840 --> 38:28.880\n Why?\n\n38:28.880 --> 38:30.320\n Because you're gonna die.\n\n38:30.320 --> 38:32.920\n Because unless you graduate from high school,\n\n38:32.920 --> 38:34.640\n unless you graduate from college,\n\n38:34.640 --> 38:37.280\n you're not gonna enter old age with enough money\n\n38:37.280 --> 38:39.480\n to retire and then die.\n\n38:39.480 --> 38:42.640\n And so, yeah, people think about it unconsciously,\n\n38:42.640 --> 38:46.920\n because it affects every aspect of your being.\n\n38:46.920 --> 38:49.240\n The fact that you go to high school, college,\n\n38:49.240 --> 38:52.240\n get married, have kids, there's a clock,\n\n38:52.240 --> 38:55.480\n a clock ticking even without your permission.\n\n38:56.600 --> 38:58.160\n It gives a sense of urgency.\n\n38:58.160 --> 39:01.040\n Do you yourself, I mean,\n\n39:01.040 --> 39:03.000\n there's so much excitement and passion\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:04.520\n in the way you talk about physics\n\n39:04.520 --> 39:07.960\n and the way you talk about technology in the future.\n\n39:07.960 --> 39:11.400\n Do you yourself meditate on your own mortality?\n\n39:11.400 --> 39:14.600\n Do you think about this clock that's ticking?\n\n39:14.600 --> 39:15.800\n Well, I try not to,\n\n39:15.800 --> 39:19.600\n because it then begins to affect your behavior.\n\n39:19.600 --> 39:21.960\n You begin to alter your behavior\n\n39:21.960 --> 39:26.280\n to match your expectation of when you're gonna die.\n\n39:26.280 --> 39:27.880\n So let's talk about youth,\n\n39:27.880 --> 39:31.040\n and then let's talk about death, okay?\n\n39:31.040 --> 39:34.840\n When I interview scientists on radio,\n\n39:34.840 --> 39:37.960\n I often ask them, what made the difference?\n\n39:37.960 --> 39:39.400\n How old were you?\n\n39:39.400 --> 39:41.920\n What changed your life?\n\n39:41.920 --> 39:44.080\n And they always say more or less the same thing.\n\n39:44.080 --> 39:45.600\n No, these are Nobel Prize winners,\n\n39:45.600 --> 39:47.040\n directors of major laboratories,\n\n39:47.040 --> 39:48.800\n very distinguished scientists.\n\n39:48.800 --> 39:51.880\n They always say, when I was 10,\n\n39:52.960 --> 39:55.480\n when I was 10, something happened.\n\n39:55.480 --> 39:57.720\n It was a visit to the planetarium.\n\n39:57.720 --> 39:59.400\n It was a telescope.\n\n39:59.400 --> 40:01.920\n For Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize,\n\n40:01.920 --> 40:03.840\n it was the chemistry kit.\n\n40:03.840 --> 40:07.240\n For Heinz Pagels, it was a visit to the planetarium.\n\n40:07.240 --> 40:10.880\n For Isidor Rabi, it was a book about the planets.\n\n40:10.880 --> 40:14.120\n For Albert Einstein, it was a compass.\n\n40:14.120 --> 40:15.560\n Something happened,\n\n40:15.560 --> 40:18.840\n which gives them this existential shock.\n\n40:18.840 --> 40:20.440\n Because you see, before the age of 10,\n\n40:20.440 --> 40:22.520\n everything is mommy and daddy, mommy and dad.\n\n40:22.520 --> 40:25.000\n That's your universe, mommy and daddy.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.480\n Around the age of 10, you begin to wonder,\n\n40:27.480 --> 40:30.680\n what's beyond mommy and daddy?\n\n40:30.680 --> 40:33.560\n And that's when you have this epiphany,\n\n40:33.560 --> 40:38.560\n when you realize, oh my God, there's a universe out there,\n\n40:38.880 --> 40:40.360\n a universe of discovery.\n\n40:40.360 --> 40:45.360\n And that sensation stays with you for the rest of your life.\n\n40:45.520 --> 40:47.880\n You still remember that shock\n\n40:47.880 --> 40:50.800\n that you felt gazing at the universe.\n\n40:50.800 --> 40:55.440\n And then you hit the greatest destroyer of scientists\n\n40:55.440 --> 40:57.560\n known to science.\n\n40:57.560 --> 41:02.480\n The greatest destroyer of scientists known to science\n\n41:02.480 --> 41:03.920\n is junior high school.\n\n41:05.560 --> 41:08.840\n When you hit junior high school, folks, it's all over.\n\n41:08.840 --> 41:10.720\n It's all over.\n\n41:10.720 --> 41:14.640\n Because in junior high school, people say, hey, stupid.\n\n41:14.640 --> 41:17.600\n I mean, you like that nerdy stuff.\n\n41:17.600 --> 41:19.800\n And your friends shun you.\n\n41:19.800 --> 41:22.560\n All of a sudden, people think you're a weirdo.\n\n41:22.560 --> 41:25.640\n And scientists made boring.\n\n41:25.640 --> 41:27.440\n Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize winner,\n\n41:27.440 --> 41:29.000\n when he was a child,\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.520\n his father would take him into the forest.\n\n41:31.520 --> 41:35.080\n And the father would teach him everything about birds,\n\n41:35.080 --> 41:36.960\n why they're shaped the way they are,\n\n41:36.960 --> 41:40.520\n their wings, the coloration, the shape of their beak,\n\n41:40.520 --> 41:43.080\n everything about birds.\n\n41:43.080 --> 41:44.440\n So one day, a bully comes up\n\n41:44.440 --> 41:47.000\n to the future Nobel Prize winner and says,\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:50.400\n hey, Dick, what's the name of that bird over there?\n\n41:51.360 --> 41:53.040\n Well, he didn't know.\n\n41:53.040 --> 41:58.040\n He knew everything about that bird except its name.\n\n41:58.760 --> 42:00.960\n So he said, I don't know.\n\n42:00.960 --> 42:03.080\n And then the bully said, what's the matter, Dick?\n\n42:03.080 --> 42:05.200\n You stupid or something?\n\n42:05.200 --> 42:08.720\n And then in that instant, he got it.\n\n42:08.720 --> 42:09.960\n He got it.\n\n42:09.960 --> 42:12.040\n He realized that for most people,\n\n42:12.040 --> 42:14.960\n science is giving names to birds.\n\n42:15.960 --> 42:17.480\n That's what science is.\n\n42:17.480 --> 42:19.800\n You know lots of names of obscure things.\n\n42:19.800 --> 42:21.720\n Hey, people say, you're smart.\n\n42:21.720 --> 42:22.800\n You're smart.\n\n42:22.800 --> 42:24.640\n You know all the names of the dinosaurs.\n\n42:24.640 --> 42:26.560\n You know all the names of the plants.\n\n42:26.560 --> 42:29.880\n No, that's not science at all.\n\n42:29.880 --> 42:34.880\n Science is about principles, concepts, physical pictures.\n\n42:36.440 --> 42:38.560\n That's what science is all about.\n\n42:38.560 --> 42:41.600\n My favorite quote from Einstein is that,\n\n42:41.600 --> 42:44.720\n unless you can explain the theory to a child,\n\n42:44.720 --> 42:47.800\n the theory is probably worthless.\n\n42:47.800 --> 42:52.720\n Meaning that all great theories are not big words.\n\n42:52.720 --> 42:57.520\n All great theories are simple concepts, principles,\n\n42:57.520 --> 43:00.440\n basic physical pictures.\n\n43:00.440 --> 43:04.480\n Relativity is all about clocks, meter sticks,\n\n43:04.480 --> 43:07.160\n rocket ships and locomotives.\n\n43:07.160 --> 43:10.040\n Newton's laws of gravity are all about balls\n\n43:10.040 --> 43:13.160\n and spinning wheels and things like that.\n\n43:13.160 --> 43:15.760\n That's what physics and science is all about,\n\n43:15.760 --> 43:17.480\n not memorizing things.\n\n43:17.480 --> 43:20.840\n And that stays with you for the rest of your life.\n\n43:20.840 --> 43:24.600\n So even in old age, I've noticed that these scientists,\n\n43:24.600 --> 43:28.000\n when they sit back, they still remember.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.480\n They still remember that flush,\n\n43:30.480 --> 43:34.880\n that flush of excitement they felt with that first telescope,\n\n43:34.880 --> 43:38.640\n that first moment when they encountered the universe.\n\n43:38.640 --> 43:40.040\n That keeps them going.\n\n43:40.040 --> 43:41.120\n That keeps them going.\n\n43:42.800 --> 43:46.200\n By the way, I should point out that when I was eight,\n\n43:46.200 --> 43:49.240\n something happened to me as well.\n\n43:49.240 --> 43:53.680\n When I was eight years old, it was in all the papers\n\n43:53.680 --> 43:56.720\n that a great scientist had just died.\n\n43:56.720 --> 44:00.760\n And they put a picture of his desk on the front page.\n\n44:00.760 --> 44:03.920\n That's it, just a simple picture of the front page\n\n44:03.920 --> 44:06.200\n of the newspapers of his desk.\n\n44:06.200 --> 44:09.120\n That desk had a book on it, which was opened.\n\n44:09.120 --> 44:11.400\n And the caption said more or less,\n\n44:11.400 --> 44:14.200\n this is the unfinished manuscript\n\n44:14.200 --> 44:16.600\n from the greatest scientists of our time.\n\n44:17.520 --> 44:22.160\n So I said to myself, well, why couldn't he finish it?\n\n44:22.160 --> 44:25.720\n What's so hard that you can't finish it\n\n44:25.720 --> 44:26.840\n if you're a great scientist?\n\n44:26.840 --> 44:28.880\n It's a homework problem, right?\n\n44:28.880 --> 44:32.000\n You go home, you solve it, or you ask your mom,\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:33.680\n why couldn't he solve it?\n\n44:33.680 --> 44:35.520\n So to me, this was a murder mystery.\n\n44:35.520 --> 44:37.800\n This was greater than any adventure story.\n\n44:37.800 --> 44:41.000\n I had to know why the greatest scientists of our time\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.160\n couldn't finish something.\n\n44:43.160 --> 44:46.480\n And then over the years, I found out the guy had a name,\n\n44:46.480 --> 44:51.480\n Albert Einstein, and that book was The Theory of Everything.\n\n44:51.480 --> 44:53.080\n It was unfinished.\n\n44:53.080 --> 44:54.800\n Well, today I can read that book.\n\n44:55.760 --> 44:59.320\n I can see all the dead ends and false starts that he made.\n\n44:59.320 --> 45:02.120\n And I began to realize that he lost his way\n\n45:02.120 --> 45:05.920\n because he didn't have a physical picture\n\n45:05.920 --> 45:09.400\n to guide him on the third try.\n\n45:09.400 --> 45:12.560\n On the first try, he talked about clocks\n\n45:12.560 --> 45:15.040\n and lightning bolts and meter sticks,\n\n45:15.040 --> 45:17.280\n and that gave us special relativity,\n\n45:17.280 --> 45:19.840\n which gave us the atomic bomb.\n\n45:19.840 --> 45:23.040\n The second great picture was gravity\n\n45:23.040 --> 45:26.320\n with balls rolling on curved surfaces.\n\n45:26.320 --> 45:28.200\n And that gave us the Big Bang,\n\n45:28.200 --> 45:30.960\n creation of the universe, black holes.\n\n45:30.960 --> 45:34.200\n On the third try, he missed it.\n\n45:34.200 --> 45:38.120\n He had no picture at all to guide him.\n\n45:38.120 --> 45:40.160\n In fact, there's a quote I have where he said,\n\n45:40.160 --> 45:41.600\n I'm still looking.\n\n45:41.600 --> 45:44.280\n I'm still looking for that picture.\n\n45:44.280 --> 45:45.800\n He never found it.\n\n45:45.800 --> 45:49.320\n Well, today we think that picture is strength theory.\n\n45:49.320 --> 45:52.240\n The strength theory can unify gravity\n\n45:52.240 --> 45:54.720\n and this mysterious thing that Einstein didn't like,\n\n45:54.720 --> 45:55.840\n which is quantum mechanics,\n\n45:55.840 --> 45:59.240\n or couldn't quite pin down and make sense of.\n\n45:59.240 --> 46:00.080\n That's right.\n\n46:00.080 --> 46:02.880\n Mother nature has two hands, a left hand and a right hand.\n\n46:02.880 --> 46:05.200\n The left hand is a theory of the small.\n\n46:05.200 --> 46:07.720\n The right hand is a theory of the big.\n\n46:07.720 --> 46:09.880\n The theory of the small is the quantum theory,\n\n46:09.880 --> 46:11.920\n the theory of atoms and quarks.\n\n46:11.920 --> 46:13.960\n The theory of the big is relativity,\n\n46:13.960 --> 46:16.360\n the theory of black holes, big bangs.\n\n46:16.360 --> 46:21.080\n The problem is the left hand does not talk to the right hand.\n\n46:22.600 --> 46:24.520\n They hate each other.\n\n46:24.520 --> 46:27.400\n The left hand is based on discrete particles.\n\n46:27.400 --> 46:31.080\n The right hand is based on smooth surfaces.\n\n46:31.080 --> 46:33.240\n How do you put these two things together\n\n46:33.240 --> 46:34.280\n into a single theory?\n\n46:34.280 --> 46:35.880\n They hate each other.\n\n46:35.880 --> 46:38.200\n The greatest minds of our time,\n\n46:38.200 --> 46:40.200\n the greatest minds of our time\n\n46:40.200 --> 46:43.280\n worked on this problem and failed.\n\n46:43.280 --> 46:46.720\n Today, the only theory that has survived\n\n46:46.720 --> 46:49.520\n every challenge so far is string theory.\n\n46:49.520 --> 46:51.600\n That doesn't mean string theory is correct.\n\n46:51.600 --> 46:53.360\n It could very well be wrong,\n\n46:53.360 --> 46:56.240\n but right now it's the only game in town.\n\n46:56.240 --> 46:57.760\n Some people come up to me and say,\n\n46:57.760 --> 47:00.240\n ''Professor, I don't believe in string theory.\n\n47:00.240 --> 47:02.720\n Give me an alternative.''\n\n47:02.720 --> 47:05.760\n And I tell them there is none.\n\n47:05.760 --> 47:06.600\n Get used to it.\n\n47:07.760 --> 47:09.360\n It's the best theory we got.\n\n47:09.360 --> 47:10.880\n It's the only theory we have.\n\n47:10.880 --> 47:13.080\n It's the only theory we have.\n\n47:13.080 --> 47:16.000\n Do you see, you know,\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:20.160\n the strings kind of inspire a view,\n\n47:20.160 --> 47:23.120\n as did atoms and particles and quarks,\n\n47:23.120 --> 47:26.720\n but especially strings inspire a view of a universe\n\n47:26.720 --> 47:29.000\n as a kind of information processing system,\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.560\n as a computer of sorts.\n\n47:31.560 --> 47:33.680\n Do you see the universe in this way?\n\n47:33.680 --> 47:34.960\n No.\n\n47:34.960 --> 47:36.320\n Some people think, in fact,\n\n47:36.320 --> 47:39.840\n the whole universe is a computer of some sort.\n\n47:39.840 --> 47:42.600\n And they believe that perhaps everything,\n\n47:42.600 --> 47:44.040\n therefore, is a simulation.\n\n47:44.040 --> 47:45.040\n Yes.\n\n47:45.040 --> 47:46.360\n I don't think so.\n\n47:46.360 --> 47:49.320\n I don't think that there is a super video game\n\n47:49.320 --> 47:52.680\n where we are nothing but puppets dancing on the screen\n\n47:52.680 --> 47:54.480\n and somebody hit the play button\n\n47:54.480 --> 47:57.560\n and here we are talking about simulations.\n\n47:57.560 --> 47:58.480\n No.\n\n47:58.480 --> 48:02.760\n Even Newtonian mechanics says that the weather,\n\n48:02.760 --> 48:04.840\n the simple weather is so complicated\n\n48:04.840 --> 48:07.320\n with trillions upon trillions of atoms\n\n48:07.320 --> 48:10.840\n that it cannot be simulated in a finite amount of time.\n\n48:10.840 --> 48:13.880\n In other words, the smallest object\n\n48:13.880 --> 48:17.280\n which can describe the weather\n\n48:17.280 --> 48:21.360\n and simulate the weather is the weather itself.\n\n48:21.360 --> 48:24.360\n The smallest object that can simulate a human\n\n48:24.360 --> 48:26.960\n is the human itself.\n\n48:26.960 --> 48:28.840\n And if you had quantum mechanics,\n\n48:28.840 --> 48:31.360\n it becomes almost impossible\n\n48:31.360 --> 48:34.800\n to simulate it with a conventional computer.\n\n48:34.800 --> 48:38.600\n This quantum mechanics deals with all possible universes,\n\n48:38.600 --> 48:42.440\n parallel universes, a multiverse of universes.\n\n48:42.440 --> 48:46.640\n And so the calculation just spirals out of control.\n\n48:46.640 --> 48:49.760\n Now, so far, there's only one way\n\n48:49.760 --> 48:52.320\n where you might be able to argue\n\n48:52.320 --> 48:54.160\n that the universe is a simulation.\n\n48:54.160 --> 48:57.440\n And this is still being debated by quantum physicists.\n\n48:58.320 --> 49:00.520\n It turns out that if you throw the encyclopedia\n\n49:00.520 --> 49:04.000\n into a black hole, the information is not lost.\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:07.600\n Eventually it winds up on the surface of the black hole.\n\n49:07.600 --> 49:09.960\n Now, the surface of the black hole is finite.\n\n49:09.960 --> 49:11.640\n In fact, you can calculate\n\n49:11.640 --> 49:13.520\n the maximum amount of information\n\n49:13.520 --> 49:15.640\n you can store in a black hole.\n\n49:15.640 --> 49:17.160\n It's a finite number.\n\n49:17.160 --> 49:19.720\n It's a calculable number, believe it or not.\n\n49:19.720 --> 49:21.720\n Now, if the universe were made out of black holes,\n\n49:21.720 --> 49:25.000\n which is the maximum universe you can conceive of,\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:27.160\n each universe, each black hole\n\n49:27.160 --> 49:29.640\n has a finite amount of information.\n\n49:29.640 --> 49:32.560\n Therefore, ergo, da da!\n\n49:32.560 --> 49:37.080\n Ergo, the total amount of information in a universe\n\n49:37.080 --> 49:38.880\n is finite.\n\n49:38.880 --> 49:40.480\n This is mind boggling.\n\n49:40.480 --> 49:42.960\n This, I consider mind boggling,\n\n49:42.960 --> 49:46.600\n that all possible universes are countable\n\n49:46.600 --> 49:50.000\n and all possible universes can be summarized in a number,\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.040\n a number you can write on a sheet of paper,\n\n49:52.040 --> 49:55.160\n all possible universes, and it's a finite number.\n\n49:55.160 --> 49:56.600\n Now, it's huge.\n\n49:56.600 --> 49:58.640\n It's a number beyond human imagination.\n\n49:59.560 --> 50:01.960\n It's a number based on what is called a Planck length,\n\n50:01.960 --> 50:03.680\n but it's a number.\n\n50:03.680 --> 50:07.560\n And so if a computer could ever simulate that number,\n\n50:07.560 --> 50:10.080\n then the universe would be a simulation.\n\n50:10.080 --> 50:13.960\n So theoretically, because the amount of information\n\n50:13.960 --> 50:18.520\n is finite, well, there necessarily must be able\n\n50:18.520 --> 50:19.880\n to exist a computer.\n\n50:19.880 --> 50:21.840\n It's just, from an engineering perspective,\n\n50:21.840 --> 50:24.080\n maybe impossible to build.\n\n50:24.080 --> 50:26.920\n Yes, no computer can build a universe\n\n50:26.920 --> 50:29.280\n capable of simulating the entire universe,\n\n50:29.280 --> 50:31.000\n except the universe itself.\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:34.040\n So that's your intuition, that our universe\n\n50:34.040 --> 50:37.960\n is very efficient, and so there's no shortcuts.\n\n50:37.960 --> 50:40.040\n Right, two reasons why I believe the universe\n\n50:40.040 --> 50:41.320\n is not a simulation.\n\n50:41.320 --> 50:44.480\n First, the calculational numbers are just incredible.\n\n50:44.480 --> 50:48.320\n No finite Turing machine can simulate the universe.\n\n50:48.320 --> 50:52.120\n And second, why would any super intelligent being\n\n50:52.120 --> 50:54.400\n simulate humans?\n\n50:54.400 --> 50:57.960\n If you think about it, most humans are kind of stupid.\n\n50:57.960 --> 51:01.040\n I mean, we do all sorts of crazy, stupid things, right?\n\n51:01.040 --> 51:03.880\n And we call it art, we call it humor.\n\n51:03.880 --> 51:06.280\n We call it human civilization.\n\n51:06.280 --> 51:08.800\n So why should an advanced civilization\n\n51:08.800 --> 51:12.680\n go through all that effort just to simulate Saturday Night\n\n51:12.680 --> 51:14.280\n Live?\n\n51:14.280 --> 51:16.400\n Well, that's a funny idea, but it's also,\n\n51:16.400 --> 51:20.200\n do you think it's possible that the act of creation\n\n51:20.200 --> 51:22.080\n cannot anticipate humans?\n\n51:22.080 --> 51:23.760\n You simply set the initial conditions\n\n51:23.760 --> 51:26.000\n and set a bunch of physical laws,\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.760\n and just for the fun of it, see what happens.\n\n51:28.760 --> 51:30.720\n You launch the thing, so you're not necessarily\n\n51:30.720 --> 51:31.680\n simulating everything.\n\n51:31.680 --> 51:35.320\n You're not simulating every little bit in the sense\n\n51:35.320 --> 51:37.720\n that you could predict what's going to happen,\n\n51:37.720 --> 51:40.960\n but you set the initial conditions, set the laws,\n\n51:40.960 --> 51:43.200\n and see what kind of fun stuff happens.\n\n51:43.200 --> 51:46.960\n Well, in some sense, that's how life got started.\n\n51:46.960 --> 51:50.120\n In the 1950s, Stanley did what is called\n\n51:50.120 --> 51:51.800\n the Miller experiment.\n\n51:51.800 --> 51:57.800\n He put a bunch of hydrogen gas, methane, toxic gases\n\n51:57.800 --> 52:02.400\n with liquid and a spark in a small glass beaker.\n\n52:02.400 --> 52:05.080\n And then he just walked away for a few weeks,\n\n52:05.080 --> 52:08.480\n came back a few weeks later, and bingo.\n\n52:08.480 --> 52:12.840\n Out of nothing and chaos came amino acids.\n\n52:12.840 --> 52:14.960\n If he had left it there for a few years,\n\n52:14.960 --> 52:19.200\n he might have gotten protein, protein molecules for free.\n\n52:19.200 --> 52:23.720\n That's probably how life got started, as a accident.\n\n52:23.720 --> 52:26.960\n And if he had left it there for perhaps a few million years,\n\n52:26.960 --> 52:30.840\n DNA might have formed in that beaker.\n\n52:30.840 --> 52:34.080\n And so we think that, yeah, DNA, life, all that\n\n52:34.080 --> 52:38.480\n could have been an accident if you wait long enough.\n\n52:38.480 --> 52:42.560\n And remember, our universe is roughly 13.8 billion years old.\n\n52:42.560 --> 52:45.600\n That's plenty of time for lots of random things\n\n52:45.600 --> 52:51.360\n to happen, including life itself.\n\n52:51.360 --> 52:56.920\n Yeah, we could be just a beautiful little random moment.\n\n52:56.920 --> 52:59.120\n And there could be an infinite number\n\n52:59.120 --> 53:02.320\n of those throughout the history of the universe,\n\n53:02.320 --> 53:04.640\n many creatures like us.\n\n53:04.640 --> 53:06.480\n We perhaps are not the epitome of what\n\n53:06.480 --> 53:07.960\n the universe is created for.\n\n53:07.960 --> 53:09.880\n Thank God.\n\n53:09.880 --> 53:11.600\n Let's hope not.\n\n53:11.600 --> 53:12.440\n Just look around.\n\n53:12.440 --> 53:13.640\n Yeah.\n\n53:13.640 --> 53:16.160\n Look to your left, look to your right.\n\n53:16.160 --> 53:20.400\n When do you think the first human will step foot on Mars?\n\n53:20.400 --> 53:23.360\n I think it's a good chance in the 2030s\n\n53:23.360 --> 53:25.280\n that we will be on Mars.\n\n53:25.280 --> 53:29.480\n In fact, there's no physics reason why we can't do it.\n\n53:29.480 --> 53:31.320\n It's an engineering problem.\n\n53:31.320 --> 53:34.480\n It's a very difficult and dangerous engineering problem,\n\n53:34.480 --> 53:36.600\n but it is an engineering problem.\n\n53:36.600 --> 53:38.640\n And in my book, Future of Humanity,\n\n53:38.640 --> 53:41.880\n I even speculate beyond that, that by the end\n\n53:41.880 --> 53:45.720\n of this century, we'll probably have the first starships.\n\n53:45.720 --> 53:47.360\n The first starships will not look\n\n53:47.360 --> 53:49.080\n like the Enterprise at all.\n\n53:49.080 --> 53:51.680\n They'll probably be small computer chips\n\n53:51.680 --> 53:54.760\n that are fired by laser beams with parachutes.\n\n53:54.760 --> 53:58.400\n And like what Stephen Hawking advocated,\n\n53:58.400 --> 54:00.160\n the Breakthrough Starshot program\n\n54:00.160 --> 54:02.920\n could send ships to the nearby stars,\n\n54:02.920 --> 54:05.400\n traveling at 20% the speed of light,\n\n54:05.400 --> 54:09.080\n reaching Alpha Centauri in about 20 years time.\n\n54:09.080 --> 54:12.880\n Beyond that, we should have fusion power.\n\n54:12.880 --> 54:15.880\n Fusion power is, in some sense, one\n\n54:15.880 --> 54:19.720\n of the ultimate sources of energy, but it's unstable.\n\n54:19.720 --> 54:22.600\n And we don't have fusion power today.\n\n54:22.600 --> 54:23.720\n Now, why is that?\n\n54:23.720 --> 54:26.160\n First of all, stars form almost for free.\n\n54:26.160 --> 54:29.560\n You get a bunch of gas large enough, it becomes a star.\n\n54:29.560 --> 54:31.920\n I mean, you don't even have to do anything to it,\n\n54:31.920 --> 54:33.480\n and it becomes a star.\n\n54:33.480 --> 54:37.440\n Why is fusion so difficult to put on the Earth?\n\n54:37.440 --> 54:40.120\n Because in outer space, stars are monopoles.\n\n54:40.120 --> 54:44.880\n They are pole, single poles that are spherically symmetric.\n\n54:44.880 --> 54:47.400\n And it's very easy to get spherically symmetric\n\n54:47.400 --> 54:51.160\n configurations of gas to compress into a star.\n\n54:51.160 --> 54:53.800\n It just happens naturally all by itself.\n\n54:53.800 --> 54:56.800\n The problem is magnetism is bipolar.\n\n54:56.800 --> 54:59.200\n You have a North Pole and a South Pole.\n\n54:59.200 --> 55:02.320\n And it's like trying to squeeze a long balloon.\n\n55:02.320 --> 55:04.960\n Take a long balloon and try to squeeze it.\n\n55:04.960 --> 55:08.240\n You squeeze one side, it bulges out the other side.\n\n55:08.240 --> 55:10.560\n Well, that's the problem with fusion machines.\n\n55:10.560 --> 55:13.440\n We use magnetism with a North Pole and a South Pole\n\n55:13.440 --> 55:17.560\n to squeeze gas, and all sorts of anomalies\n\n55:17.560 --> 55:20.240\n and horrible configurations can take place\n\n55:20.240 --> 55:23.440\n because we're not squeezing something uniformly\n\n55:23.440 --> 55:24.920\n like in a star.\n\n55:24.920 --> 55:27.200\n Stars, in some sense, are for free.\n\n55:27.200 --> 55:31.120\n Fusion on the Earth is very difficult.\n\n55:31.120 --> 55:32.960\n But I think it's inevitable.\n\n55:32.960 --> 55:37.000\n And it'll eventually give us unlimited power from seawater.\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:39.880\n So seawater will be the ultimate source of energy\n\n55:39.880 --> 55:41.160\n for the planet Earth.\n\n55:41.160 --> 55:41.680\n Why?\n\n55:41.680 --> 55:42.760\n What's the intuition there?\n\n55:42.760 --> 55:45.440\n Because we'll extract hydrogen from seawater,\n\n55:45.440 --> 55:47.760\n burn hydrogen in a fusion reactor\n\n55:47.760 --> 55:52.200\n to give us unlimited energy without the meltdown,\n\n55:52.200 --> 55:53.960\n without the nuclear waste.\n\n55:53.960 --> 55:55.680\n Why do we have meltdowns?\n\n55:55.680 --> 55:57.920\n We have meltdowns because in the fusion reactors,\n\n55:57.920 --> 56:00.760\n every time you split the uranium atom, you get nuclear waste.\n\n56:00.760 --> 56:01.720\n Tons of it.\n\n56:01.720 --> 56:07.080\n 30 tons of nuclear waste per reactor per year.\n\n56:07.080 --> 56:08.400\n And it's hot.\n\n56:08.400 --> 56:11.200\n It's hot for thousands, millions of years.\n\n56:11.200 --> 56:13.200\n That's why we have meltdowns.\n\n56:13.200 --> 56:15.680\n But you see, the waste product of a fusion reactor\n\n56:15.680 --> 56:17.480\n is helium gas.\n\n56:17.480 --> 56:19.880\n Helium gas is actually commercially valuable.\n\n56:19.880 --> 56:22.320\n You can make money selling helium gas.\n\n56:22.320 --> 56:24.960\n And so the waste product of a fusion reactor\n\n56:24.960 --> 56:28.600\n is helium, not nuclear waste that we find\n\n56:28.600 --> 56:30.720\n in a commercial fission plant.\n\n56:30.720 --> 56:34.240\n And that controlling, mastering and controlling fusion\n\n56:34.240 --> 56:38.320\n allows us to, converts us into a type one,\n\n56:38.320 --> 56:40.200\n I guess, civilization, right?\n\n56:40.200 --> 56:43.280\n Yeah, probably the backbone of a type one civilization\n\n56:43.280 --> 56:45.720\n will be fusion power.\n\n56:45.720 --> 56:47.760\n We, by the way, are type zero.\n\n56:47.760 --> 56:49.600\n We don't even rate on this scale.\n\n56:49.600 --> 56:52.080\n We get our energy from dead plants, for God's sake,\n\n56:52.080 --> 56:53.560\n oil and coal.\n\n56:53.560 --> 56:56.320\n But we are about 100 years from being type one.\n\n56:56.320 --> 56:57.680\n Get a calculator.\n\n56:57.680 --> 56:59.960\n In fact, Carl Sagan calculated that we\n\n56:59.960 --> 57:05.640\n are about 0.7, fairly close to a 1.0.\n\n57:05.640 --> 57:08.720\n For example, what is the internet?\n\n57:08.720 --> 57:12.280\n The internet is the beginning of the first type one technology\n\n57:12.280 --> 57:14.080\n to enter into our century.\n\n57:14.080 --> 57:17.400\n The first planetary technology is the internet.\n\n57:17.400 --> 57:19.840\n What is the language of type one?\n\n57:19.840 --> 57:23.400\n On the internet already, English and Mandarin Chinese\n\n57:23.400 --> 57:26.880\n are the most dominant languages on the internet.\n\n57:26.880 --> 57:29.360\n And what about the culture?\n\n57:29.360 --> 57:34.560\n We're seeing a type one sports, soccer, the Olympics,\n\n57:34.560 --> 57:38.920\n a type one music, youth culture, rock and roll, rap music,\n\n57:38.920 --> 57:42.920\n type one fashion, Gucci, Chanel, a type one economy,\n\n57:42.920 --> 57:45.600\n the European Union, NAFTA, what have you.\n\n57:45.600 --> 57:49.280\n So we're beginning to see the beginnings of a type one\n\n57:49.280 --> 57:52.200\n culture in a type one civilization.\n\n57:52.200 --> 57:56.000\n And inevitably, it will spread beyond this planet.\n\n57:56.000 --> 58:00.680\n So you talked about sending at 20% the speed of light\n\n58:00.680 --> 58:04.800\n on a chip into Alpha Centauri.\n\n58:04.800 --> 58:07.960\n But in a slightly nearer term, what\n\n58:07.960 --> 58:11.120\n do you think about the idea when we still have to send\n\n58:11.120 --> 58:15.240\n our biological bodies the colonization of planets,\n\n58:15.240 --> 58:16.560\n colonization of Mars?\n\n58:16.560 --> 58:21.360\n Do you see us becoming a two planet species ever\n\n58:21.360 --> 58:23.120\n or anytime soon?\n\n58:23.120 --> 58:26.320\n Well, just remember the dinosaurs\n\n58:26.320 --> 58:28.760\n did not have a space program.\n\n58:28.760 --> 58:30.440\n And that's why they're not here today.\n\n58:30.440 --> 58:33.640\n How come there are no dinosaurs in this room today?\n\n58:33.640 --> 58:35.920\n Because they didn't have a space program.\n\n58:35.920 --> 58:38.320\n We do have a space program, which\n\n58:38.320 --> 58:40.760\n means that we have an insurance policy.\n\n58:40.760 --> 58:43.080\n Now, I don't think we should bankrupt the Earth\n\n58:43.080 --> 58:44.840\n or deplete the Earth to go to Mars.\n\n58:44.840 --> 58:47.360\n That's too expensive and not practical.\n\n58:47.360 --> 58:50.560\n But we need a settlement, a settlement on Mars\n\n58:50.560 --> 58:53.640\n in case something bad happens to the planet Earth.\n\n58:53.640 --> 58:56.400\n And that means we have to terraform Mars.\n\n58:56.400 --> 58:58.600\n Now, to terraform Mars, if we could\n\n58:58.600 --> 59:03.600\n raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees, six degrees,\n\n59:03.600 --> 59:08.480\n then the polar ice caps begin to melt, releasing water vapor.\n\n59:08.480 --> 59:10.600\n Water vapor is a greenhouse gas.\n\n59:10.600 --> 59:13.400\n It causes even more melting of the ice caps.\n\n59:13.400 --> 59:17.120\n So it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\n59:17.120 --> 59:18.880\n It feeds on itself.\n\n59:18.880 --> 59:21.240\n It becomes autocatalytic.\n\n59:21.240 --> 59:24.040\n And so once you hit six degrees, rising\n\n59:24.040 --> 59:27.200\n of the temperature on Mars by six degrees, it takes off.\n\n59:27.200 --> 59:29.280\n And we melt the polar ice caps.\n\n59:29.280 --> 59:32.600\n And liquid water once again flows\n\n59:32.600 --> 59:35.840\n in the rivers, the canals, the channels,\n\n59:35.840 --> 59:38.440\n and the oceans of Mars.\n\n59:38.440 --> 59:39.920\n Mars once had an ocean, we think,\n\n59:39.920 --> 59:42.080\n about the size of the United States.\n\n59:42.080 --> 59:44.320\n And so that is a possibility.\n\n59:44.320 --> 59:46.040\n Now, how do we get there?\n\n59:46.040 --> 59:49.040\n How do we raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees?\n\n59:49.040 --> 59:51.680\n Elon Musk would like to detonate hydrogen warheads\n\n59:51.680 --> 59:53.680\n on the polar ice caps.\n\n59:53.680 --> 59:56.880\n Well, I'm not sure about that.\n\n59:56.880 --> 59:59.680\n Because we don't know that much about the effects\n\n59:59.680 --> 1:00:03.520\n of detonating hydrogen warheads to melt the polar ice caps.\n\n1:00:03.520 --> 1:00:05.840\n And who wants to glow in the dark at night reading\n\n1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:07.240\n the newspaper?\n\n1:00:07.240 --> 1:00:09.560\n So I think there are other ways to do it\n\n1:00:09.560 --> 1:00:12.000\n with solar satellites.\n\n1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:16.080\n You can have satellites orbiting Mars that beam sunlight\n\n1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:19.480\n onto the polar ice caps, melting the polar ice caps.\n\n1:00:19.480 --> 1:00:21.440\n Mars has plenty of water.\n\n1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:24.200\n It's just frozen.\n\n1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:27.880\n I think you paint an inspiring and a wonderful picture\n\n1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:29.760\n of the future.\n\n1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:35.120\n I think you've inspired and educated thousands,\n\n1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:36.240\n if not millions.\n\n1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:37.400\n Michio, it's been an honor.\n\n1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:39.000\n Thank you so much for talking today.\n\n1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:42.080\n My pleasure.\n\n"
