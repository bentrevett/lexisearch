wrestling,\n\n00:06.640 --> 00:10.320\n three time NCAA wrestling champion at University of Iowa,\n\n00:10.320 --> 00:14.080\n and one of the greatest coaches in the history of wrestling,\n\n00:14.080 --> 00:18.160\n leading the University of Iowa Hawkeyes for 15 years,\n\n00:18.160 --> 00:22.960\n including in 2021 winning the national championships,\n\n00:22.960 --> 00:26.640\n and getting a coach of the year award, his third.\n\n00:26.640 --> 00:30.320\n He's known for his intensity, focus, and mental toughness,\n\n00:30.320 --> 00:33.120\n embodying both as a wrestler and coach,\n\n00:33.120 --> 00:36.480\n the culture and spirit of Iowa wrestling.\n\n00:36.480 --> 00:39.520\n We recorded this conversation almost exactly three years ago\n\n00:39.520 --> 00:42.400\n after I attended the University of Iowa\n\n00:42.400 --> 00:45.280\n versus Iowa State wrestling meet\n\n00:45.280 --> 00:48.400\n in the historic Carver Hawkeye Arena.\n\n00:48.400 --> 00:50.880\n Tom graciously invited me to his home,\n\n00:50.880 --> 00:54.160\n where his family, a couple of friends, and me\n\n00:54.160 --> 00:57.680\n spent several hours chatting about wrestling and life.\n\n00:57.680 --> 01:01.520\n We recorded this brief podcast conversation that evening,\n\n01:01.520 --> 01:06.080\n and I wasn't sure where, how, or whether we'll publish it.\n\n01:06.080 --> 01:08.880\n But returning to it now three years later,\n\n01:08.880 --> 01:12.000\n I realized just how meaningful that evening was for me.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:14.320\n And even though I was nervous,\n\n01:14.320 --> 01:16.400\n didn't even put on my jacket,\n\n01:16.400 --> 01:19.360\n it's a moment I would love to share with others.\n\n01:19.360 --> 01:21.840\n The mix of intensity and heartfelt kindness\n\n01:21.840 --> 01:23.440\n from Tom and his family\n\n01:23.440 --> 01:26.080\n made me want to stay in Iowa forever.\n\n01:26.080 --> 01:28.480\n I think I will return there soon enough\n\n01:28.480 --> 01:30.560\n because of the amazing people there,\n\n01:30.560 --> 01:34.160\n and because Iowa is still, in many ways,\n\n01:34.160 --> 01:37.920\n the heart of the indomitable spirit of American wrestling,\n\n01:37.920 --> 01:41.200\n a sport I love and to which I'm deeply grateful\n\n01:41.200 --> 01:43.200\n for humbling me early in life\n\n01:43.200 --> 01:46.080\n and helping me and many others\n\n01:46.080 --> 01:49.840\n build character through hard work.\n\n01:49.840 --> 01:52.000\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:54.240\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:54.240 --> 01:55.360\n in the description.\n\n01:55.360 --> 01:59.040\n And now here's my conversation with Tom Brands.\n\n02:00.240 --> 02:03.360\n What's the best motivator for you or for your athletes?\n\n02:04.160 --> 02:07.040\n Hatred of losing or love of winning?\n\n02:08.160 --> 02:10.560\n For me personally, it was definitely the hatred of losing.\n\n02:10.560 --> 02:13.040\n I was not a guy that was about pageantry.\n\n02:13.040 --> 02:16.240\n I was not a guy that was about the parade.\n\n02:18.240 --> 02:20.240\n When I wrestled in Atlanta,\n\n02:20.240 --> 02:22.800\n I rented a three cylinder Geo with my wife,\n\n02:22.800 --> 02:23.920\n drove home and mowed the lawn\n\n02:23.920 --> 02:25.360\n because it hadn't been mowed for a month.\n\n02:25.920 --> 02:28.000\n And I remember one of our neighbors driving by\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:29.600\n and they were like, they did a double take,\n\n02:29.600 --> 02:31.920\n like, well, that's the, I thought he was in Atlanta.\n\n02:31.920 --> 02:33.120\n Well, I was in Atlanta yesterday.\n\n02:33.120 --> 02:34.080\n I just sat on the stand\n\n02:34.080 --> 02:35.600\n and got a gold medal put around my neck.\n\n02:36.480 --> 02:37.920\n That's how I was.\n\n02:37.920 --> 02:40.160\n That doesn't mean that it was the right approach\n\n02:40.160 --> 02:41.120\n or the wrong approach.\n\n02:41.120 --> 02:42.640\n It's just what worked for me.\n\n02:42.640 --> 02:44.560\n But when you were a kid, you and Terry,\n\n02:44.560 --> 02:46.800\n you dreamed about winning that Olympic gold.\n\n02:46.800 --> 02:47.360\n Yeah, so.\n\n02:47.360 --> 02:48.400\n That's about winning then.\n\n02:48.400 --> 02:52.000\n So there is the lure of winning,\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:53.920\n but what drives you is that,\n\n02:55.520 --> 02:56.720\n you know, as you move forward,\n\n02:56.720 --> 03:01.120\n there's just no reason that you have to settle\n\n03:01.120 --> 03:02.400\n for anything but being the best.\n\n03:03.120 --> 03:07.440\n And if, it just, it would get to you to the point where\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:09.360\n that's not gonna happen to me again.\n\n03:10.640 --> 03:13.120\n So what, the thing that keeps you up at night\n\n03:13.120 --> 03:15.360\n is the losses and that's not,\n\n03:15.360 --> 03:17.120\n that's not gonna happen to me again.\n\n03:17.120 --> 03:18.800\n That's the thought that keeps you up at night.\n\n03:18.800 --> 03:21.440\n That's the thought that drives you in your training.\n\n03:21.440 --> 03:24.480\n That's why you do, you know, nine ropes\n\n03:24.480 --> 03:27.520\n when Gable says do three ropes and buddy pushups\n\n03:27.520 --> 03:29.360\n and you're out of here and you do nine\n\n03:29.360 --> 03:31.200\n or you do them until you can't do any more.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:34.320\n And it's a very rare ingredient.\n\n03:34.320 --> 03:36.320\n The older I get, the more rare I find it is.\n\n03:37.680 --> 03:40.560\n The ingredient of loss feeding,\n\n03:41.680 --> 03:44.240\n feeding that, the drive of hard training?\n\n03:44.240 --> 03:46.240\n Maybe that because everybody's so worried\n\n03:46.240 --> 03:48.320\n about the negative whatever\n\n03:48.320 --> 03:50.480\n and you're putting too much pressure on yourself.\n\n03:50.480 --> 03:51.600\n So maybe that.\n\n03:51.600 --> 03:53.760\n But what I meant was it's when a coach says,\n\n03:53.760 --> 03:56.960\n okay, finish with four ropes and, you know,\n\n03:56.960 --> 04:00.240\n buddy pushups and four way neck, you know,\n\n04:00.240 --> 04:02.640\n I would do 12 or 10.\n\n04:02.640 --> 04:03.760\n That's rare.\n\n04:03.760 --> 04:05.280\n It's no longer about what the coach says.\n\n04:05.280 --> 04:09.680\n It's your own demons that you're trying to exercise out.\n\n04:09.680 --> 04:12.640\n What's the few losses you've had in your life?\n\n04:12.640 --> 04:16.160\n Are all of them just melt together\n\n04:16.160 --> 04:18.160\n or is there something that stands out in your mind?\n\n04:18.160 --> 04:22.560\n I'm a guy that remembers my career that well.\n\n04:23.680 --> 04:29.680\n I know that I am judged on a very small portion of my life\n\n04:29.680 --> 04:32.320\n and that's minutes of wrestling matches,\n\n04:32.320 --> 04:33.920\n you know, a lot of winning,\n\n04:33.920 --> 04:35.440\n but there's some losing in there too.\n\n04:35.440 --> 04:38.640\n And, you know, people think they know you because of that\n\n04:38.640 --> 04:40.480\n and they think they know you\n\n04:40.480 --> 04:42.080\n because they see you in a press conference.\n\n04:42.080 --> 04:45.920\n But, you know, to go back to the original question,\n\n04:47.440 --> 04:49.040\n you know, I don't know how to answer that.\n\n04:49.040 --> 04:53.440\n So there's no losses that just that eat at you still.\n\n04:53.440 --> 04:57.280\n There's opponents that I have learned a great deal from.\n\n04:57.280 --> 05:02.080\n I mean, my loss to John Smith in 1991,\n\n05:02.880 --> 05:07.360\n US Open was something that I learned a lot about.\n\n05:08.400 --> 05:09.680\n I learned a lot about positioning.\n\n05:09.680 --> 05:12.400\n I learned a lot about the importance of par terre.\n\n05:13.280 --> 05:16.240\n You know, in a certain kind of crazy way,\n\n05:16.240 --> 05:18.240\n I learned that I could go with the best guy in the world,\n\n05:18.240 --> 05:19.520\n even though it was 14 to four.\n\n05:20.400 --> 05:22.720\n And this is when Tech Falls were 15 or 12 points.\n\n05:22.720 --> 05:25.280\n I didn't get Tech Fall and that wasn't a badge of honor for me.\n\n05:25.920 --> 05:27.280\n But I knew I could go with him\n\n05:27.280 --> 05:28.560\n because it was one point takedowns.\n\n05:28.560 --> 05:29.840\n I scored four takedowns on him.\n\n05:30.880 --> 05:33.280\n And I learned that I had to move my feet\n\n05:34.480 --> 05:37.680\n and I learned what it meant to move your feet constantly.\n\n05:37.680 --> 05:39.520\n And there's no break.\n\n05:39.520 --> 05:43.440\n John Smith is a very, very intense competitor\n\n05:43.440 --> 05:47.120\n that people know that now, six time world Olympic champion.\n\n05:47.120 --> 05:48.720\n And I felt that firsthand.\n\n05:49.520 --> 05:53.440\n But I did not go in there taking a back seat,\n\n05:53.440 --> 05:57.360\n even though the score was very lopsided.\n\n05:57.360 --> 05:59.520\n But you knew you could stand with the best of the world.\n\n05:59.520 --> 06:03.040\n I knew that this is what this is about.\n\n06:03.040 --> 06:04.640\n And you know what, you move your feet\n\n06:04.640 --> 06:07.760\n and you don't give up a lace that's so damn tight\n\n06:07.760 --> 06:10.640\n that you can't feel your calf muscle.\n\n06:11.360 --> 06:12.960\n And I had to get ready for the consolation\n\n06:12.960 --> 06:13.680\n side of the bracket,\n\n06:13.680 --> 06:15.040\n because I believe that was in the semis.\n\n06:17.040 --> 06:18.640\n And you just learn from that.\n\n06:18.640 --> 06:23.520\n And it was better than learning from a win\n\n06:23.520 --> 06:26.320\n over a second ranked senior level guy\n\n06:26.320 --> 06:27.520\n when you're a junior in college.\n\n06:28.480 --> 06:31.040\n You're wrestling the best on a stage.\n\n06:31.040 --> 06:34.960\n So if you look back, you probably spent tens of thousands\n\n06:34.960 --> 06:38.560\n of hours on the mat, spilled sweat, blood,\n\n06:39.280 --> 06:41.600\n even tears, maybe, maybe a few times.\n\n06:41.600 --> 06:43.760\n So technically or philosophically,\n\n06:43.760 --> 06:45.840\n how would you do any of those hours differently?\n\n06:45.840 --> 06:49.200\n Just looking back at the tens of thousands of hours.\n\n06:49.200 --> 06:53.440\n I would be more, probably in my older age,\n\n06:53.440 --> 06:56.080\n I probably would have been more relaxed in my training\n\n06:56.800 --> 06:59.040\n and probably would have went another cycle.\n\n06:59.040 --> 07:02.640\n If I could do it over again, in 96,\n\n07:02.640 --> 07:05.680\n I really thought that when Gable retired,\n\n07:05.680 --> 07:07.040\n that I would be the next guy in line.\n\n07:07.040 --> 07:08.800\n And I was wrong and that was immature of me.\n\n07:09.600 --> 07:10.720\n In terms of the coach.\n\n07:10.720 --> 07:12.480\n In terms of the coach, yes.\n\n07:12.480 --> 07:14.240\n And I knew that Gable was close.\n\n07:14.240 --> 07:16.480\n I mean, I didn't know when, but it just so happens,\n\n07:16.480 --> 07:18.560\n you know, 97 was his record breaking year\n\n07:18.560 --> 07:21.760\n and then he retired, but I didn't know how close he was.\n\n07:21.760 --> 07:23.760\n But I knew that he had, you know,\n\n07:23.760 --> 07:25.760\n he went down with a bad hip injury.\n\n07:25.760 --> 07:29.120\n And so, you know, you're just, you're not gonna.\n\n07:29.920 --> 07:33.280\n So what does a relaxed Tom Brands look like?\n\n07:33.280 --> 07:35.680\n You're saying you would have been a little more relaxed.\n\n07:35.680 --> 07:39.040\n More like where, you know what, I was pretty dang good\n\n07:39.040 --> 07:40.880\n and I was getting better every day,\n\n07:41.440 --> 07:43.760\n but maybe doing a little bit different, a little bit smarter.\n\n07:43.760 --> 07:47.680\n And Terry actually did that going through 2000.\n\n07:48.720 --> 07:49.680\n He had to do it.\n\n07:49.680 --> 07:53.280\n And he would have been in the, you know,\n\n07:53.280 --> 07:58.560\n the funny farm, let alone the, you know, the physical farm,\n\n07:58.560 --> 08:02.000\n whatever you want to say, mentally and physically beat up.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:07.840\n But he had to learn to less is more type approach.\n\n08:07.840 --> 08:12.400\n And how it came around was, is, you know,\n\n08:12.400 --> 08:14.160\n you work hard at feeling good.\n\n08:14.720 --> 08:16.720\n You work hard in your recovery.\n\n08:16.720 --> 08:21.440\n So even when you're not wrestling hard in that wrestling room,\n\n08:21.440 --> 08:25.760\n and looking for the toughest partner to go,\n\n08:25.760 --> 08:28.720\n you're still working hard in your recovery.\n\n08:28.720 --> 08:30.480\n And massage could be that.\n\n08:31.040 --> 08:32.240\n Stretching could be that.\n\n08:33.440 --> 08:36.480\n Things like that, that are more fluffy.\n\n08:37.200 --> 08:39.520\n And that's something you weren't as good at?\n\n08:39.520 --> 08:41.120\n The recovery aspect of this?\n\n08:41.120 --> 08:42.080\n Never, never.\n\n08:42.960 --> 08:44.800\n There's not a place for it with young people.\n\n08:45.440 --> 08:49.280\n Because in my opinion, there's so much development to have,\n\n08:49.280 --> 08:51.600\n there's so much development to have happened.\n\n08:52.480 --> 08:55.280\n I mean, when you need to learn wrestling,\n\n08:55.280 --> 08:56.320\n you need to be wrestling.\n\n08:57.760 --> 09:02.240\n And as you get older, your body won't do it anymore.\n\n09:03.280 --> 09:05.920\n And so to learn wrestling, it's more of a,\n\n09:05.920 --> 09:07.440\n probably a relaxed approach.\n\n09:08.320 --> 09:10.400\n So if you had to choose between two athletes\n\n09:11.760 --> 09:14.320\n who would dominate competition,\n\n09:14.320 --> 09:17.920\n one who drills 100,000 reps of a specific take down,\n\n09:17.920 --> 09:22.240\n specific technique, or one that spends that time live wrestling?\n\n09:22.240 --> 09:24.240\n Both, it's the same.\n\n09:24.240 --> 09:25.920\n And I like to live wrestling,\n\n09:25.920 --> 09:27.520\n I was always wanting to live wrestle,\n\n09:27.520 --> 09:29.600\n bring the warm up into the live wrestle, let's go.\n\n09:30.640 --> 09:33.600\n But where I got really, really good was a repetition.\n\n09:34.160 --> 09:37.200\n And I was disciplined enough to know that the things\n\n09:37.200 --> 09:40.240\n that you hate to do in this sport\n\n09:40.240 --> 09:42.080\n are the things that make you the very best.\n\n09:42.640 --> 09:45.760\n And that is a rare ingredient as I've gotten older.\n\n09:45.760 --> 09:47.920\n And you spend a lot of time communicating that\n\n09:47.920 --> 09:49.120\n to younger athletes.\n\n09:50.160 --> 09:53.280\n So the thing, if you feel yourself hating something,\n\n09:53.280 --> 09:55.280\n that's probably the thing you should be doing.\n\n09:55.280 --> 09:56.080\n Yes, as a matter of fact,\n\n09:56.080 --> 09:57.680\n I had a strength coach when I was really young.\n\n09:58.560 --> 10:00.800\n He was just a fricking guy that would,\n\n10:01.360 --> 10:04.480\n he wore white, like he was almost like a nurse,\n\n10:04.480 --> 10:05.680\n nurses clothes.\n\n10:05.680 --> 10:07.920\n He wore all white from head to toe.\n\n10:07.920 --> 10:09.680\n And he was in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\n10:10.400 --> 10:11.840\n And his first name was Walt.\n\n10:11.840 --> 10:15.280\n And he taught Terry and I to hate the bar away from you\n\n10:15.280 --> 10:16.800\n on that last rep when you're dead.\n\n10:17.360 --> 10:19.280\n And whether it's a curl, you hate it up.\n\n10:19.840 --> 10:21.920\n And then you do the negative and you hate it down\n\n10:21.920 --> 10:23.920\n and you hate that bench up and you hate it.\n\n10:23.920 --> 10:25.760\n You look at the bar and you hate it away from you.\n\n10:26.640 --> 10:30.560\n So I learned and I was young, I was young.\n\n10:31.360 --> 10:34.880\n And I remember being born, my mom's sister lived out there\n\n10:34.880 --> 10:36.720\n and we were dropped off to stay out there with our cousins.\n\n10:36.720 --> 10:38.320\n And I was born a little bit.\n\n10:38.320 --> 10:39.840\n And they always treated us really good.\n\n10:39.840 --> 10:45.360\n But this was like the single most bright spot\n\n10:45.360 --> 10:48.160\n in a weightlifting, like enlightenment,\n\n10:48.160 --> 10:49.440\n even though I lifted weights.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.880\n But I never knew the psychology behind lifting weights.\n\n10:52.880 --> 10:54.800\n It's just to look good and so you can flex\n\n10:54.800 --> 10:56.720\n and look in the mirror or is it for performance?\n\n10:57.280 --> 10:58.880\n And this guy was about performance.\n\n11:00.480 --> 11:01.840\n And you said repetition.\n\n11:01.840 --> 11:03.280\n Do you mean technique?\n\n11:03.280 --> 11:05.520\n I'm talking repetition, technique, technique, technique,\n\n11:05.520 --> 11:07.760\n drill, drill, drill, hit, hit, hit, drive, finish,\n\n11:07.760 --> 11:08.960\n hit, hit, hit, drive, finish.\n\n11:08.960 --> 11:10.320\n So you believe in that.\n\n11:10.320 --> 11:12.000\n I believe in that wholeheartedly.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.080\n And I believe that you have to do it on your own.\n\n11:17.440 --> 11:20.640\n I don't believe in the coach taking you to the promised land.\n\n11:21.920 --> 11:25.680\n So in the guys today or in yourself,\n\n11:25.680 --> 11:29.840\n how often do you see people that grow the belief\n\n11:29.840 --> 11:32.400\n of doing 10,000, 20,000 reps?\n\n11:32.400 --> 11:33.520\n I think it's rare.\n\n11:33.520 --> 11:34.480\n I think it's very rare.\n\n11:34.480 --> 11:36.080\n And I think it's especially rare.\n\n11:36.080 --> 11:37.680\n I mean, you can talk about that as a coach,\n\n11:37.680 --> 11:42.320\n but it's especially rare to bring a guy to that understanding,\n\n11:42.320 --> 11:43.920\n but you never stop trying.\n\n11:43.920 --> 11:45.520\n You're always trying to reach him.\n\n11:46.080 --> 11:49.280\n I mean, we didn't have a good performance out there tonight,\n\n11:49.280 --> 11:50.800\n but you know what?\n\n11:50.800 --> 11:52.080\n You don't stop communicating.\n\n11:53.200 --> 11:56.080\n And there's a lot of programs out there\n\n11:56.080 --> 11:59.120\n that put their head down when things aren't going their way.\n\n11:59.120 --> 12:00.560\n And then as things start going their way,\n\n12:00.560 --> 12:01.920\n then they rise with the tide.\n\n12:02.560 --> 12:05.840\n There was no difference in the demeanor of our corner.\n\n12:05.840 --> 12:08.160\n And we talk about that, that's a philosophy.\n\n12:08.160 --> 12:10.000\n And so you're reaching your guys that way.\n\n12:11.280 --> 12:13.840\n So go back to your point or your question.\n\n12:13.840 --> 12:16.800\n Do you believe in the 10,000 reps?\n\n12:16.800 --> 12:17.600\n And yes, I do.\n\n12:19.200 --> 12:20.560\n How do you inspire people to do that?\n\n12:20.560 --> 12:23.120\n So by example, but communication.\n\n12:23.120 --> 12:28.240\n But I mean, in my experience, what I've seen communicating\n\n12:28.240 --> 12:30.400\n the value of repetition and drilling\n\n12:30.400 --> 12:31.440\n is a hard thing to communicate.\n\n12:31.440 --> 12:32.000\n It's hard.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.800\n And it's very rare to have somebody that goes in there\n\n12:34.800 --> 12:36.720\n and will do it on their own.\n\n12:36.720 --> 12:39.200\n Do you have young guys that step up and do that?\n\n12:39.200 --> 12:41.120\n We do, and it's rare.\n\n12:41.120 --> 12:42.960\n And the guys that do it on their own\n\n12:42.960 --> 12:44.080\n and have done it on their own\n\n12:44.080 --> 12:47.600\n are the guys that are in that lineup and doing well.\n\n12:48.480 --> 12:51.600\n The other thing is that when you talk about\n\n12:52.240 --> 12:53.520\n getting to that next level,\n\n12:54.880 --> 12:58.320\n a lot of times what held you back\n\n12:58.320 --> 13:01.600\n was I did everything the coach asked of me and nothing more.\n\n13:02.800 --> 13:03.440\n Right.\n\n13:03.440 --> 13:08.320\n I mean, you can be a great guy for a coach as an athlete,\n\n13:09.120 --> 13:10.800\n and you did everything that coach asked,\n\n13:10.800 --> 13:12.000\n but you did nothing more.\n\n13:12.880 --> 13:14.800\n So you're really looking for the guys\n\n13:14.800 --> 13:17.440\n that go way beyond what the coach says.\n\n13:17.440 --> 13:20.080\n We don't want guys that are looking at their watch\n\n13:20.080 --> 13:21.920\n running out of the room when practice is over.\n\n13:22.560 --> 13:25.040\n We want guys that know what they have to get done,\n\n13:25.040 --> 13:26.240\n and they might leave early,\n\n13:26.960 --> 13:28.720\n but they're not looking at their watch.\n\n13:28.720 --> 13:29.600\n They might be done early.\n\n13:29.600 --> 13:32.560\n They might be, we might be on a whole different path,\n\n13:32.560 --> 13:34.640\n and this guy just excuses himself.\n\n13:34.640 --> 13:35.680\n I'm all about that.\n\n13:36.240 --> 13:38.800\n We are not autocrats.\n\n13:38.800 --> 13:40.320\n There's an internal engine in there.\n\n13:40.320 --> 13:41.680\n Is that something you're born with,\n\n13:42.240 --> 13:43.760\n or is that something you can develop?\n\n13:43.760 --> 13:45.440\n I think you are born with it.\n\n13:45.440 --> 13:46.960\n You develop it also,\n\n13:46.960 --> 13:48.880\n and I think that there has to be comfort,\n\n13:48.880 --> 13:50.320\n and I go back to communication,\n\n13:50.880 --> 13:55.600\n that young people are comfortable enough to communicate\n\n13:55.600 --> 13:57.360\n that I need to take the day off.\n\n13:59.120 --> 14:00.320\n So what do you mean by communication?\n\n14:00.320 --> 14:00.880\n Or I need to do something different.\n\n14:00.880 --> 14:02.480\n Communication, exactly.\n\n14:02.480 --> 14:07.120\n So letting athletes be part of their own development.\n\n14:07.120 --> 14:10.480\n Communication to me is letting them know\n\n14:11.760 --> 14:15.040\n what they need to do to get themselves in contention\n\n14:15.040 --> 14:16.240\n to be the starting quarterback,\n\n14:18.080 --> 14:22.720\n and then to give them boosts and compliments\n\n14:22.720 --> 14:23.760\n when they earn them,\n\n14:23.760 --> 14:31.760\n and I don't have time to waste with lies and cheating.\n\n14:32.320 --> 14:33.280\n And when I say cheating,\n\n14:33.280 --> 14:34.880\n I'm talking about when they cheat themselves,\n\n14:34.880 --> 14:37.600\n and so those become very direct conversations,\n\n14:37.600 --> 14:39.760\n and the conversation starts like this.\n\n14:39.760 --> 14:41.760\n I don't have time to waste, and neither do you,\n\n14:42.560 --> 14:44.000\n and so why are we wasting our time?\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:45.360\n And here's what I mean by that.\n\n14:46.160 --> 14:49.920\n We're having a conversation about your accountability.\n\n14:49.920 --> 14:52.240\n If you look in the mirror and you're accountable,\n\n14:52.240 --> 14:54.640\n then we aren't taking the time to go through this.\n\n14:55.280 --> 14:57.600\n We're already on our way to solving the problem.\n\n14:57.600 --> 15:00.080\n Problem can't be solved without that understanding.\n\n15:00.960 --> 15:03.200\n And that has to do with symptoms\n\n15:03.200 --> 15:04.560\n that you see in the wrestling room.\n\n15:04.560 --> 15:05.680\n There's something where the fire's not quite there.\n\n15:05.680 --> 15:07.600\n That has to do with mental, emotional,\n\n15:07.600 --> 15:10.480\n spiritual, physical, everything.\n\n15:10.480 --> 15:11.680\n Everything that you know about.\n\n15:11.680 --> 15:14.000\n You know, I had a boss,\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.240\n and our athletic director is a great athletic director,\n\n15:16.240 --> 15:17.280\n and he's a great athlete,\n\n15:17.280 --> 15:18.320\n and he's a great athlete,\n\n15:18.320 --> 15:20.080\n and our athletic director is a great athletic director,\n\n15:20.080 --> 15:22.400\n and he gives us everything we need to be successful,\n\n15:22.400 --> 15:24.240\n but I had a boss, his name was Fred Mims,\n\n15:24.240 --> 15:26.160\n and I didn't think anybody could be better than him,\n\n15:26.160 --> 15:28.400\n and then all of a sudden this Gene Taylor guy came in,\n\n15:29.120 --> 15:30.800\n and then he was pretty doggone good too,\n\n15:30.800 --> 15:33.680\n and he actually was just like Fred\n\n15:33.680 --> 15:35.840\n and maybe even a little bit more current,\n\n15:35.840 --> 15:37.680\n and then he ended up taking a job at Kansas State\n\n15:37.680 --> 15:39.120\n where he's the athletic director now,\n\n15:39.840 --> 15:42.880\n and then this lady, Barbara Burke, comes in,\n\n15:43.520 --> 15:45.280\n and I didn't think anybody could be better\n\n15:45.280 --> 15:46.880\n than Gene Taylor or Fred Mims,\n\n15:46.880 --> 15:49.600\n and this Barbara Burke, she's better than both of them,\n\n15:50.160 --> 15:52.880\n and the reason why is because she's a problem solver.\n\n15:52.880 --> 15:54.080\n She doesn't waste time.\n\n15:54.080 --> 15:56.320\n She's direct, and she's a problem solver,\n\n15:56.320 --> 15:57.520\n and that's what we need.\n\n15:57.520 --> 15:58.800\n You need problem solvers.\n\n16:01.120 --> 16:06.080\n So on the flip side of problems and technique and repetition,\n\n16:06.880 --> 16:10.160\n here's a thing called toughness, mental toughness,\n\n16:10.720 --> 16:14.160\n something that maybe you or maybe even Iowa in general\n\n16:14.160 --> 16:15.680\n is a little bit known for.\n\n16:15.680 --> 16:19.040\n So how do you train mental toughness as a coach?\n\n16:19.040 --> 16:23.040\n You train mental toughness by putting them in situations\n\n16:23.040 --> 16:27.280\n that they're willing to go through\n\n16:27.280 --> 16:28.560\n but don't think they can make it,\n\n16:28.560 --> 16:29.440\n and then they go through it,\n\n16:29.440 --> 16:31.040\n and then all of a sudden those berries are down.\n\n16:31.760 --> 16:35.840\n Does that have to do with physical usually exhaustion,\n\n16:36.640 --> 16:38.240\n the four reps on the ropes?\n\n16:38.240 --> 16:40.720\n It has to do with that,\n\n16:40.720 --> 16:45.040\n and it has to do with understanding why we're doing it.\n\n16:45.040 --> 16:47.760\n And sometimes understanding why we're doing it\n\n16:47.760 --> 16:51.360\n might not come for months, but there's blind faith,\n\n16:52.320 --> 16:54.880\n and we have a heavyweight in the room right now,\n\n16:54.880 --> 16:58.080\n this young guy that he's like that.\n\n16:58.080 --> 17:00.000\n He doesn't necessarily understand it.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:02.480\n He asks a lot of questions, but he doesn't,\n\n17:03.360 --> 17:04.880\n and he's been here four months now,\n\n17:04.880 --> 17:05.760\n four and a half months now,\n\n17:05.760 --> 17:06.960\n and he's getting better every day.\n\n17:07.760 --> 17:10.320\n So mental toughness too is a matter of repetition.\n\n17:11.440 --> 17:13.280\n Mental toughness is a matter of repetition\n\n17:13.280 --> 17:15.920\n and having an open mind and being extremely accountable,\n\n17:15.920 --> 17:20.400\n and not only accountable that when you maybe,\n\n17:21.840 --> 17:22.960\n when something doesn't go your way,\n\n17:22.960 --> 17:24.320\n that you look in the mirror and own it,\n\n17:24.320 --> 17:27.600\n but accountable to the point of view that,\n\n17:27.600 --> 17:30.400\n you know what, I gotta get tough in this situation\n\n17:30.400 --> 17:31.760\n right here, right now,\n\n17:31.760 --> 17:33.760\n and this is what's gonna make or break me.\n\n17:33.760 --> 17:36.640\n And I talked about my own career being defined by,\n\n17:36.640 --> 17:38.320\n you know, a couple of minutes on the mat,\n\n17:39.040 --> 17:41.440\n but that's when you're gonna be defined.\n\n17:41.440 --> 17:43.360\n That's how you're gonna be defined.\n\n17:43.360 --> 17:44.000\n That's okay.\n\n17:44.640 --> 17:46.640\n So people are gonna talk about you,\n\n17:46.640 --> 17:47.920\n so you might as well have them talking about\n\n17:47.920 --> 17:48.960\n how doggone tough you are.\n\n17:51.040 --> 17:53.760\n What about, we live in a world now,\n\n17:53.760 --> 17:55.840\n I have often in my own work,\n\n17:55.840 --> 17:58.720\n I hear about this concept of work life balance\n\n17:58.720 --> 17:59.760\n or overtraining.\n\n18:00.400 --> 18:04.720\n So you've been one of the hardest workers ever on the mat.\n\n18:04.720 --> 18:06.720\n You've coached some of the hardest workers ever.\n\n18:07.360 --> 18:10.480\n Do you think it's possible to over train, train too much?\n\n18:10.480 --> 18:11.440\n How big of a concern is it?\n\n18:11.440 --> 18:15.520\n I think peaking and burnout are frames of mind\n\n18:15.520 --> 18:19.440\n or burnout is a like you let things probably\n\n18:19.440 --> 18:21.760\n get to the point where you could have arrested them\n\n18:22.320 --> 18:23.440\n with a good frame of mind.\n\n18:24.160 --> 18:25.840\n But peaking is a frame of mind\n\n18:25.840 --> 18:28.880\n and you have to know, be able to read,\n\n18:28.880 --> 18:29.840\n and that's a lot of it.\n\n18:30.480 --> 18:33.040\n And the individual athlete also has to know\n\n18:33.920 --> 18:35.760\n that it's a frame of mind.\n\n18:35.760 --> 18:38.480\n And so when you have a coach that's reading that the right way\n\n18:38.480 --> 18:42.160\n and you have an athlete that is knowing that\n\n18:42.160 --> 18:45.200\n when zero hour comes that you're gonna be ready to go\n\n18:46.160 --> 18:48.880\n and knowing that there's light at the end of the tunnel\n\n18:48.880 --> 18:51.840\n if you feel like you're burning that candle at both ends,\n\n18:51.840 --> 18:53.920\n light's coming at the end of the tunnel.\n\n18:53.920 --> 18:54.880\n I mean, you're good to go.\n\n18:55.520 --> 18:59.280\n So you think about Gable and that whole dream\n\n18:59.280 --> 19:02.160\n of being carried off the mat because you worked so hard.\n\n19:02.160 --> 19:04.800\n And again, do you think it's possible to overtrain?\n\n19:04.800 --> 19:07.040\n So you said it's mental.\n\n19:07.040 --> 19:08.880\n I do think it's possible to overtrain\n\n19:08.880 --> 19:10.240\n if you have a lot of distractions.\n\n19:11.120 --> 19:13.280\n And if you're looking at your watch running out of the room,\n\n19:14.400 --> 19:16.960\n then yeah, that frame of mind\n\n19:16.960 --> 19:19.200\n isn't gonna lend itself to excellency.\n\n19:19.200 --> 19:22.560\n And the thing is, is we have to accomplish\n\n19:22.560 --> 19:24.800\n what we need to get accomplished to get better every day.\n\n19:24.800 --> 19:26.880\n You can't kind of accomplish what you need to accomplish.\n\n19:26.880 --> 19:27.840\n You have to accomplish it.\n\n19:28.560 --> 19:31.520\n And when you're in that mindset,\n\n19:31.520 --> 19:33.440\n then the clock is irrelevant.\n\n19:33.440 --> 19:35.920\n There's no place for a clock in the wrestling room.\n\n19:35.920 --> 19:38.000\n And maybe a clock that times a match,\n\n19:39.200 --> 19:40.240\n but it may be a clock.\n\n19:40.960 --> 19:42.800\n We're student athletes here,\n\n19:42.800 --> 19:47.120\n but that's why we encourage when you schedule your classes\n\n19:47.120 --> 19:53.200\n that you don't have a class that comes right up to practice time\n\n19:53.200 --> 19:56.960\n or starts as a night class and it starts at 5.30.\n\n19:56.960 --> 19:59.520\n Go to get the 6.30 class or the seven o clock.\n\n19:59.520 --> 20:01.520\n So you leave it all behind your heart,\n\n20:01.520 --> 20:02.960\n your passion is completely in it.\n\n20:02.960 --> 20:03.360\n There's no problem.\n\n20:03.360 --> 20:05.040\n When you walk in that wrestling room,\n\n20:05.040 --> 20:08.320\n there's no distractions and it's never eternal.\n\n20:08.320 --> 20:10.240\n The only thing that's eternal is death.\n\n20:11.440 --> 20:12.720\n You know, there's nothing.\n\n20:12.720 --> 20:14.640\n Sometimes guys come in there and they wig out.\n\n20:15.760 --> 20:18.320\n It's an hour and 25 minutes,\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.280\n or an hour and 45 minutes.\n\n20:22.640 --> 20:25.520\n You have to be willing to go as long as it takes.\n\n20:25.520 --> 20:26.400\n There's no clock.\n\n20:26.400 --> 20:27.120\n There's no clock.\n\n20:28.320 --> 20:30.080\n Again, wrestlers are some of the hardest,\n\n20:30.080 --> 20:33.040\n some of the toughest people in all of sports,\n\n20:33.040 --> 20:35.840\n but weight cutting often breaks people.\n\n20:35.840 --> 20:38.400\n So what's your thought on weight cutting,\n\n20:38.400 --> 20:40.640\n both nutrition wise, mental wise?\n\n20:40.640 --> 20:43.680\n How do you approach and think of it as a coach\n\n20:43.680 --> 20:44.800\n in your own career too?\n\n20:45.520 --> 20:49.440\n It's a lot of discipline and it's a lot of discipline\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.840\n during a very uncomfortable time period\n\n20:51.840 --> 20:53.120\n that really doesn't last that long,\n\n20:53.120 --> 20:54.960\n but it feels like it lasts long and it's painful.\n\n20:56.080 --> 20:57.920\n But once you shrink your body down\n\n20:58.880 --> 21:01.120\n and if you're hydrated, you'll get through it.\n\n21:01.120 --> 21:03.280\n If you're a little hungry, but you're eating,\n\n21:04.080 --> 21:06.960\n but you're hydrated, once you break that sweat,\n\n21:06.960 --> 21:09.120\n your energy depletion goes away.\n\n21:09.120 --> 21:10.320\n That's a fact.\n\n21:10.320 --> 21:11.680\n I've practiced that.\n\n21:11.680 --> 21:13.200\n You come in and you're yawning\n\n21:13.840 --> 21:16.560\n and you're starting to shrink your body down\n\n21:16.560 --> 21:17.760\n and it's that time of year where,\n\n21:17.760 --> 21:19.360\n hey, I gotta get my body shrunk down\n\n21:20.080 --> 21:22.960\n and you're dehydrated, you are dead in the water.\n\n21:23.760 --> 21:26.720\n But if you're hungry and hydrated,\n\n21:26.720 --> 21:27.840\n when you break that sweat...\n\n21:27.840 --> 21:30.000\n Have people gotten better with that over the years,\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:30.880\n over the past few decades?\n\n21:30.880 --> 21:34.000\n I think that coaches, science is better.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.600\n I think that coaches communicate it.\n\n21:35.600 --> 21:36.720\n I think they always have.\n\n21:37.360 --> 21:38.960\n I think the bottom line is,\n\n21:38.960 --> 21:41.680\n is having the energy to implement that\n\n21:41.680 --> 21:46.480\n and taking a guy by the hand when he doesn't understand\n\n21:46.480 --> 21:48.480\n and he's new in your program and he's essential\n\n21:49.120 --> 21:51.760\n and or he's unwilling to and not disciplined enough\n\n21:51.760 --> 21:53.040\n because when you take him by the hand enough,\n\n21:53.040 --> 21:54.240\n they won't learn that discipline.\n\n21:55.680 --> 21:56.400\n This is a fact.\n\n21:56.400 --> 22:00.080\n This is an important aspect of wrestling, buddy.\n\n22:00.640 --> 22:01.760\n You know what I'm saying?\n\n22:01.760 --> 22:05.760\n So, you know, it's not just go and show up for the match.\n\n22:06.640 --> 22:08.960\n I mean, it's not about just making weight either.\n\n22:08.960 --> 22:10.160\n You gotta be able to make weight.\n\n22:10.160 --> 22:12.000\n That's part of the warm up.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.240\n That's part of the process, getting ready to wrestle.\n\n22:14.240 --> 22:14.720\n It's a whole thing.\n\n22:14.720 --> 22:15.600\n It's a lifestyle.\n\n22:15.600 --> 22:15.840\n Yeah.\n\n22:16.720 --> 22:18.400\n When did you first start believing\n\n22:19.120 --> 22:20.720\n you're going to win Olympic gold?\n\n22:21.840 --> 22:22.880\n I don't know.\n\n22:22.880 --> 22:25.840\n I mean, I found out I got really addicted\n\n22:25.840 --> 22:28.640\n to wrestling really, really fast, started late.\n\n22:28.640 --> 22:30.480\n But looking back at my life,\n\n22:31.920 --> 22:33.920\n wrestled my whole life with my twin brother.\n\n22:34.560 --> 22:37.840\n And when Terry and I would fight, it was wrestling\n\n22:37.840 --> 22:38.960\n and it was to maim.\n\n22:39.520 --> 22:43.840\n And so if you're trying to maim me,\n\n22:43.840 --> 22:46.480\n I better be tough because if I roll over\n\n22:47.680 --> 22:49.280\n and expect you to scratch my belly\n\n22:49.280 --> 22:51.040\n when you're trying to maim me, I won't lose my head.\n\n22:51.040 --> 22:55.360\n And Tom and Terry Brands, there was no alpha male.\n\n22:55.360 --> 22:58.160\n And when it was on, it was on for real.\n\n22:58.160 --> 22:59.520\n What do you mean there's no alpha male?\n\n22:59.520 --> 23:00.880\n There's both?\n\n23:00.880 --> 23:02.160\n There are a lot of twins.\n\n23:02.160 --> 23:03.360\n There's a dominant twin.\n\n23:03.360 --> 23:04.160\n Oh, a lot of them.\n\n23:04.160 --> 23:04.640\n Ah.\n\n23:04.640 --> 23:08.400\n Very few times is there a situation\n\n23:08.400 --> 23:11.440\n where I'm going to win every time in everything\n\n23:11.440 --> 23:13.840\n and then he's thinking the same exact way.\n\n23:13.840 --> 23:15.840\n And Terry used to describe it like when we used\n\n23:15.840 --> 23:17.520\n to get interviewed a lot about our careers.\n\n23:17.520 --> 23:19.920\n Like it'd be like you grabbing a steering wheel\n\n23:19.920 --> 23:22.160\n and me grabbing a steering wheel and fighting.\n\n23:22.160 --> 23:24.240\n And that's what it was like when you would wrestle him\n\n23:24.240 --> 23:25.040\n or fight him.\n\n23:25.760 --> 23:27.760\n And so I had that benefit.\n\n23:27.760 --> 23:28.720\n So when did I know?\n\n23:28.720 --> 23:31.280\n Well, I got addicted to wrestling really, really fast\n\n23:31.280 --> 23:34.000\n in fifth grade and started to research it.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:37.520\n And I don't know why and talked about the Olympics\n\n23:37.520 --> 23:43.600\n and put it in my head and remember said something\n\n23:43.600 --> 23:45.760\n about being an Olympic champion in fifth grade.\n\n23:45.760 --> 23:47.760\n And somebody made fun of me and I got in a fight\n\n23:47.760 --> 23:48.560\n in the playground.\n\n23:49.360 --> 23:53.040\n And I remember getting pulled in,\n\n23:53.040 --> 23:54.000\n getting in trouble for that.\n\n23:54.960 --> 23:57.600\n And the people that got me in trouble for that\n\n23:57.600 --> 24:00.880\n were smart enough to not rake me over the coals,\n\n24:00.880 --> 24:03.440\n but they researched or they actually found out\n\n24:03.440 --> 24:04.800\n what the fight was about.\n\n24:04.800 --> 24:05.920\n And I was distraught.\n\n24:06.880 --> 24:09.600\n I was really emotional, like crying\n\n24:09.600 --> 24:10.640\n or whatever you want to say.\n\n24:10.640 --> 24:12.480\n You don't want to admit that too many times.\n\n24:12.480 --> 24:15.600\n But it wasn't because I got beat up or got my nose bloodied\n\n24:15.600 --> 24:18.720\n or got punched in the face or broke my arm\n\n24:19.440 --> 24:20.400\n or there was any pain.\n\n24:20.400 --> 24:24.000\n It was because they stomped on my dream and they doubted me.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:25.360\n And so I fought for that.\n\n24:26.080 --> 24:27.840\n And that was a lesson.\n\n24:27.840 --> 24:29.360\n There's going to be a lot of doubters.\n\n24:29.920 --> 24:34.320\n And one thing we talk about as a staff is our staff\n\n24:34.320 --> 24:38.800\n has to be lockstep in that hallway, in our offices.\n\n24:38.800 --> 24:43.920\n And when you deviate outside of that, that is heresy.\n\n24:43.920 --> 24:45.840\n So everybody has to be on board,\n\n24:45.840 --> 24:48.400\n confident that you're going to be number one in the country.\n\n24:48.400 --> 24:51.280\n When we go forward and we go put our public foot forward,\n\n24:51.280 --> 24:52.080\n there is a decision.\n\n24:52.080 --> 24:54.800\n We are unified and there is no backbiting.\n\n24:55.360 --> 24:56.960\n And we have great people right now.\n\n24:56.960 --> 24:58.320\n And we hadn't had that before.\n\n24:58.320 --> 25:01.520\n We've had detractors in our Hawkeye Wrestling Club.\n\n25:01.520 --> 25:03.840\n We've had guys that would go out and get rolled up\n\n25:03.840 --> 25:05.920\n in ankle laces and not be able to walk.\n\n25:05.920 --> 25:08.880\n We've had guys that would go out and get rolled up in ankle laces\n\n25:08.880 --> 25:11.200\n and not care in our club.\n\n25:11.200 --> 25:12.560\n And we got Brandon Sorensen,\n\n25:12.560 --> 25:15.440\n who got rolled up by James Green last night.\n\n25:15.440 --> 25:18.080\n But I'll tell you what, I don't have a problem with that.\n\n25:18.080 --> 25:18.720\n You know why?\n\n25:18.720 --> 25:20.400\n Because I know it means a lot to him.\n\n25:20.400 --> 25:21.520\n He didn't roll over.\n\n25:22.160 --> 25:24.960\n He didn't quit because he was on the consolation side of a bracket.\n\n25:25.680 --> 25:28.160\n And so when you have that and then you have,\n\n25:29.120 --> 25:31.440\n if there's a disagreement, it's behind closed doors.\n\n25:31.440 --> 25:32.560\n And then you're moving forward.\n\n25:32.560 --> 25:35.680\n And when you have people that when they're meeting your fans\n\n25:35.680 --> 25:38.800\n and your supporters, you know, they're talking the right way\n\n25:38.800 --> 25:39.840\n with the right message.\n\n25:40.560 --> 25:42.880\n And anything that's cattywonk is to that,\n\n25:42.880 --> 25:44.080\n you got to be careful there.\n\n25:44.560 --> 25:45.600\n You got to be careful there.\n\n25:46.560 --> 25:49.840\n So that in terms of affirmation, in terms of really believing\n\n25:49.840 --> 25:52.720\n as a team, as an individual, believing that you're the best\n\n25:52.720 --> 25:57.040\n in the world, did you, I'm sure you had detractors.\n\n25:57.040 --> 25:59.600\n You had people that continued after fifth grade.\n\n25:59.600 --> 26:03.440\n And that's probably where my hatred of losing trumps\n\n26:03.440 --> 26:06.640\n my love for winning because I wanted to shove it up\n\n26:06.640 --> 26:07.920\n their rear end bad.\n\n26:08.800 --> 26:09.300\n Yeah.\n\n26:10.640 --> 26:13.760\n And the thing is, is we maintain a high level\n\n26:13.760 --> 26:15.440\n and there's very few programs.\n\n26:15.440 --> 26:18.880\n Oklahoma State, Ohio State now, Penn State.\n\n26:19.440 --> 26:21.760\n I mean, there's four programs that try to win\n\n26:21.760 --> 26:22.880\n a national title every year.\n\n26:23.840 --> 26:24.480\n And that's it.\n\n26:24.480 --> 26:28.320\n And these other teams, they get up and they got a good team\n\n26:28.320 --> 26:29.840\n and they get up and they get going.\n\n26:30.400 --> 26:32.720\n And then when things don't go well, okay,\n\n26:32.720 --> 26:34.080\n we're going to do it next year.\n\n26:34.080 --> 26:35.440\n Or this is a down year.\n\n26:35.440 --> 26:36.320\n We're going to get right.\n\n26:36.320 --> 26:37.360\n We're three years out.\n\n26:37.920 --> 26:39.920\n So no matter what you're fighting for first.\n\n26:39.920 --> 26:40.400\n We do.\n\n26:40.400 --> 26:43.040\n And we haven't won and you say, well, even one in eight years.\n\n26:43.040 --> 26:43.520\n Well, you're right.\n\n26:43.520 --> 26:44.020\n We haven't.\n\n26:44.640 --> 26:47.760\n But look at our results are better than anybody out there.\n\n26:47.760 --> 26:49.520\n And it's besides Penn State.\n\n26:49.520 --> 26:54.240\n And it's because of our mentality and because we have great people.\n\n26:54.240 --> 26:56.560\n Ryan Morningstar, Bobby Telfer, Terry Brands,\n\n26:56.560 --> 26:59.680\n our medical team, even our strength coach,\n\n26:59.680 --> 27:01.680\n Quinn Holland, we're all on the same page.\n\n27:02.560 --> 27:04.880\n And when I send something, I hit it immediately.\n\n27:04.880 --> 27:06.000\n I don't have time to waste.\n\n27:06.560 --> 27:09.200\n There will not be dissension in that hallway.\n\n27:09.200 --> 27:10.640\n Everybody's in together.\n\n27:10.640 --> 27:11.140\n Yeah.\n\n27:11.680 --> 27:14.160\n 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.\n\n27:14.160 --> 27:19.760\n Can you take me through the day when you're going for the 62 kg gold?\n\n27:19.760 --> 27:20.560\n What did you eat?\n\n27:21.200 --> 27:22.000\n Drink?\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:22.720\n What did you think?\n\n27:23.360 --> 27:24.640\n It really doesn't matter.\n\n27:24.640 --> 27:28.960\n Um, I have a routine that, you know, I had a routine as a competitor\n\n27:28.960 --> 27:30.320\n that I could run through right now.\n\n27:31.200 --> 27:35.440\n Um, it was a lot of self talk, very, very positive self talk.\n\n27:35.440 --> 27:36.320\n Visualization.\n\n27:36.320 --> 27:36.720\n Yes.\n\n27:36.720 --> 27:38.880\n Visualization, um, self talk.\n\n27:39.440 --> 27:43.520\n Um, and, and that's how I was able to relax and getting ready for\n\n27:43.520 --> 27:44.640\n matches my whole life.\n\n27:45.440 --> 27:49.120\n Learned that very early age at a camp and a developmental camp\n\n27:49.680 --> 27:51.040\n at a young age, Terry and I did.\n\n27:51.040 --> 27:57.600\n And, um, I can tell you what I ate and I can tell you what I did to\n\n27:57.600 --> 27:59.200\n relax and it doesn't matter.\n\n27:59.840 --> 28:03.040\n Um, what you have to do is you have to find that piece.\n\n28:03.840 --> 28:08.320\n And I just know that when I was getting ready for the finals match,\n\n28:08.320 --> 28:09.680\n I had gone back to my room.\n\n28:09.680 --> 28:15.440\n I had my relaxed material, you know, and I was able to relax\n\n28:15.440 --> 28:17.520\n because I prepared for it.\n\n28:17.520 --> 28:21.680\n Hopefully I'm right on this, but just looking at the insane bracket\n\n28:21.680 --> 28:24.240\n you had to go through, you had to beat, just to get to the finals,\n\n28:24.240 --> 28:27.120\n it had to be three world champions, eventually world champ.\n\n28:27.120 --> 28:29.040\n I mean, Dave, and you know what?\n\n28:29.040 --> 28:31.920\n I don't talk about that and nobody else does either, but everybody\n\n28:31.920 --> 28:33.200\n talks about it in their own career.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:39.120\n So now you're making my head big, but yeah, I had a road, I had a road.\n\n28:39.120 --> 28:39.680\n You're right.\n\n28:39.680 --> 28:41.440\n That is the hardest bracket I've seen.\n\n28:41.440 --> 28:43.360\n So I've talked to a lot of Olympic champions.\n\n28:43.840 --> 28:46.320\n That is the hardest bracket I've seen of any champion.\n\n28:46.320 --> 28:50.880\n So maybe I'm confused on this, but it seemed like a really tough day for you.\n\n28:50.880 --> 28:53.920\n Did you have, did you know the bracket ahead of time?\n\n28:53.920 --> 28:55.280\n Did you know who you faced?\n\n28:55.280 --> 28:58.240\n You see the draw and it's a two day tournament.\n\n28:58.960 --> 29:05.040\n So psychology comes into it as much as physical shape, you know,\n\n29:05.040 --> 29:09.040\n because there's those, you got to sleep, you know, the night before\n\n29:09.040 --> 29:11.520\n after the weigh in, then you got to sleep again that next night\n\n29:11.520 --> 29:14.800\n after your semi final match is going to be in the morning.\n\n29:14.800 --> 29:16.960\n You know, and then you have to go back and rest because your final\n\n29:16.960 --> 29:18.880\n matches in Intel, whatever time it was.\n\n29:19.680 --> 29:23.280\n And so all this relaxation and all that stuff that you just talked about,\n\n29:23.280 --> 29:25.200\n that visualization and self talk, that's what helps you.\n\n29:25.200 --> 29:26.000\n It's your routine.\n\n29:27.120 --> 29:31.520\n And was there any doubt, any fear, any, anything there?\n\n29:31.520 --> 29:33.920\n The fear is the type of fear.\n\n29:34.720 --> 29:37.280\n And I just talked about this to one of my athletes today.\n\n29:38.320 --> 29:43.040\n Jack Dempsey talked about fear and the fear of losing is what motivates\n\n29:43.040 --> 29:45.200\n him to try to take his opponent's head off.\n\n29:45.200 --> 29:48.720\n He was a boxer and that's okay.\n\n29:49.360 --> 29:54.320\n So fear of competition, fear of screwing up, fear of, oh, I don't feel good.\n\n29:54.320 --> 29:55.520\n No, no.\n\n29:55.520 --> 29:58.720\n But that little fear that, you know what, there's somebody out there\n\n29:58.720 --> 30:02.800\n that thinks that, you know what, they're going to, they're going to revel in my,\n\n30:03.600 --> 30:07.040\n they're going to, they're going to, they're going to eat it up in my misery.\n\n30:07.040 --> 30:10.240\n They're going to love, they're going to be thriving because I fail.\n\n30:10.240 --> 30:12.160\n And I'm not going to let that happen.\n\n30:13.360 --> 30:15.920\n You're identical twin brother, Terry.\n\n30:15.920 --> 30:21.280\n You've been at him, like you said, your whole life, and you're both some of the\n\n30:21.280 --> 30:22.640\n greatest wrestlers of all time.\n\n30:23.120 --> 30:24.000\n You won the gold medal.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:25.200\n He won the bronze medal.\n\n30:25.840 --> 30:30.000\n You've mentioned, you know, all that really matters is the six minutes or,\n\n30:30.400 --> 30:33.840\n you know, just a few minutes, sometimes a few seconds to find your whole career.\n\n30:33.840 --> 30:38.480\n So how do you think about that thin line, the tragic line, and how do you\n\n30:38.480 --> 30:42.880\n think about that line, the tragic line at the Olympic level between winning and\n\n30:42.880 --> 30:43.360\n losing?\n\n30:43.360 --> 30:47.840\n I think you come to peace that in the end, when it's over, that you did the\n\n30:47.840 --> 30:48.400\n best you could.\n\n30:49.280 --> 30:52.320\n And that's certainly the case with Terry.\n\n30:53.040 --> 30:56.320\n He has a career credentials are better than mine internationally.\n\n30:57.040 --> 30:58.560\n You know, he won two world championships.\n\n30:58.560 --> 31:01.840\n I won one and he won an Olympic bronze medal.\n\n31:01.840 --> 31:06.320\n And, you know, I won an Olympic gold medal, but I only won one.\n\n31:06.320 --> 31:09.920\n The thing is, is that's not what's important anyway.\n\n31:09.920 --> 31:17.440\n What's important is, is that when it's all over, you know, how do you look\n\n31:17.440 --> 31:18.080\n back on it?\n\n31:18.720 --> 31:22.160\n And you're kind of like, well, you just said that you made sure that you\n\n31:22.160 --> 31:23.520\n weren't going to leave anything undone.\n\n31:24.160 --> 31:24.880\n But you know what?\n\n31:24.880 --> 31:27.280\n There were tournaments where I did leave things undone.\n\n31:27.840 --> 31:29.120\n And so how do you come back from that?\n\n31:29.120 --> 31:31.760\n Well, Terry never came back from 2000 because he retired.\n\n31:32.560 --> 31:33.680\n Well, you know what?\n\n31:33.680 --> 31:37.360\n Duplicate and exceed when you're communicating to these young athletes.\n\n31:38.160 --> 31:41.600\n And because of that experience, that makes Terry a better coach.\n\n31:41.600 --> 31:45.680\n Because of, you know, 1995, that makes me a better coach.\n\n31:46.560 --> 31:51.680\n You know, realizing that there are certain things that unraveled in that\n\n31:51.680 --> 31:54.320\n year that I could have controlled looking back on it.\n\n31:54.960 --> 31:58.640\n And when you have that perspective, you can communicate.\n\n31:59.280 --> 32:01.520\n So what control is there?\n\n32:01.520 --> 32:02.880\n Can you control everything?\n\n32:02.880 --> 32:04.720\n How big of a role is luck?\n\n32:04.720 --> 32:09.040\n Control how you react to an injury, control that.\n\n32:09.040 --> 32:10.880\n So you can't, you don't have any control over it.\n\n32:10.880 --> 32:18.080\n It's over, you know, you have whatever and whatever happened, but relax.\n\n32:18.080 --> 32:20.640\n And you learn to deal with injuries better because of that.\n\n32:20.640 --> 32:25.520\n You have that experience that you let this thing maybe get the best of you.\n\n32:25.520 --> 32:27.120\n And that's just an example.\n\n32:27.120 --> 32:33.520\n And, you know, Terry put a lot of demons to rest with that bronze medal.\n\n32:34.640 --> 32:38.400\n So becoming an Olympic medalist, a few demons could relax.\n\n32:38.400 --> 32:40.160\n Well, a little, he will never admit that.\n\n32:40.160 --> 32:42.080\n And he probably isn't truthful.\n\n32:42.080 --> 32:45.280\n And I should, I'm speaking for him, but he's truthful when he says that.\n\n32:45.760 --> 32:54.240\n But if I look at it and bronze sucks, but if I look at it, he did put some\n\n32:54.240 --> 32:56.000\n demons to rest and I'm proud of him for it.\n\n32:56.000 --> 33:03.760\n There's something there that is a consolation in the fact that he won the consolation medal.\n\n33:04.400 --> 33:08.800\n The consolation medal sucks, but there is a consolation that he won the consolation medal.\n\n33:08.800 --> 33:10.400\n That's a tough medal to win, by the way.\n\n33:10.400 --> 33:10.900\n Yeah.\n\n33:11.920 --> 33:18.800\n But do you see the Shakespearean tragedy of it all that the line between winning and losing?\n\n33:18.800 --> 33:23.280\n So you often say that, you know, winning is everything, but it feels like, especially\n\n33:23.280 --> 33:30.160\n at the Olympic level, or you talk about NCAA finals or that tournament, you know, a split\n\n33:30.160 --> 33:37.040\n second miss move can result in a loss where you dominated all the way up to there.\n\n33:37.040 --> 33:39.200\n That's where your psychology comes in.\n\n33:39.200 --> 33:43.840\n And that's where the repetition and all of the self talk and visualization\n\n33:43.840 --> 33:47.040\n and the physical shape and everything comes together.\n\n33:47.680 --> 33:49.360\n And so that doesn't happen.\n\n33:49.360 --> 33:55.520\n And tonight, we got beat twice, actually three times, and we out wrestled those.\n\n33:55.520 --> 34:01.520\n We lost three matches and we out wrestled the guy for six minutes and 30 seconds, or\n\n34:01.520 --> 34:03.440\n one match went to overtime.\n\n34:04.160 --> 34:09.520\n And if our guys can move forward with the right perspective, I'm confident that they'll\n\n34:09.520 --> 34:10.320\n be better.\n\n34:11.680 --> 34:16.400\n I'll tell you what, I'd take our guy over their guy any day, any day, because our guys\n\n34:16.400 --> 34:17.760\n get up for every match.\n\n34:17.760 --> 34:19.440\n And now we got a lot to work on.\n\n34:20.880 --> 34:21.920\n A lot to work on.\n\n34:21.920 --> 34:22.880\n But you know what?\n\n34:22.880 --> 34:26.000\n I can say all that and I'll take our guy and blah, blah, blah.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.640\n But what are they going to do tonight in their meal?\n\n34:28.640 --> 34:30.880\n What are they going to do tonight in their rest?\n\n34:30.880 --> 34:35.040\n What are they going to do tomorrow in their recovery on their own, necessarily?\n\n34:35.040 --> 34:37.040\n What are they going to do Monday?\n\n34:37.040 --> 34:46.240\n Great wrestlers can use their imagination with a win that they're not satisfied with\n\n34:46.800 --> 34:49.520\n and go forward as if it was a loss.\n\n34:49.520 --> 34:51.600\n But it's still easier to go forward with that win.\n\n34:52.160 --> 34:56.800\n But they can, they don't just, oh, I won, I'm fine, goes on.\n\n34:56.800 --> 35:01.520\n But then when they lose the exact same way that they could have lost before, then they\n\n35:01.520 --> 35:02.560\n go off the deep end.\n\n35:02.560 --> 35:03.760\n And then that's when they lose.\n\n35:03.760 --> 35:07.280\n They could have lost before, then they go off the deep end and then that's when they're\n\n35:07.280 --> 35:08.960\n going to make the change in their life.\n\n35:08.960 --> 35:11.680\n And we talked about that to our team tonight.\n\n35:12.400 --> 35:21.920\n And the mature, rare ingredient is, is guys that can get better even with success like\n\n35:21.920 --> 35:24.400\n it was a loss without beating themselves up.\n\n35:24.400 --> 35:25.760\n That's complicated.\n\n35:25.760 --> 35:26.240\n It is.\n\n35:26.240 --> 35:26.880\n It's a balance.\n\n35:26.880 --> 35:33.040\n You often talk about Iowa's focus on creating individual champions like Spencer Lee.\n\n35:34.320 --> 35:37.920\n Can you explain the philosophy of focusing on individuals versus the team?\n\n35:39.040 --> 35:45.760\n I think that we need to put them both together and the individual impacts the team.\n\n35:45.760 --> 35:53.280\n And, you know, we haven't done that since 2010 and we need to do a better job of putting\n\n35:53.280 --> 35:57.040\n 10 weight classes out there that contribute to the team.\n\n35:57.040 --> 35:58.880\n And if it's not 10, then it's nine.\n\n35:59.760 --> 36:03.520\n And if it's not nine, it can't be four, you know?\n\n36:03.520 --> 36:10.560\n And that takes a lot of pride and it takes a lot of, you know, where the coach is on\n\n36:10.560 --> 36:11.120\n top of it.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:19.520\n And, you know, you're not just working on the easy things, the glaring things.\n\n36:19.520 --> 36:21.120\n You're working on everything.\n\n36:21.120 --> 36:22.400\n What do you mean by everything?\n\n36:22.400 --> 36:23.440\n So, the\u2026\n\n36:24.400 --> 36:32.480\n Like there's just some, you know, there's ideas that when you're a coach that aren't\n\n36:32.480 --> 36:34.720\n there beneath the surface and you got to find them.\n\n36:36.480 --> 36:38.320\n And that's where communication comes in.\n\n36:38.320 --> 36:38.800\n Yeah.\n\n36:38.800 --> 36:42.480\n But you're talking about, yeah, we got to move forward.\n\n36:42.480 --> 36:43.680\n Well, what does that mean?\n\n36:43.680 --> 36:45.040\n Well, I know what that means.\n\n36:45.040 --> 36:52.320\n But how many guys really know what that means in their program?\n\n36:52.320 --> 36:55.120\n You know, there's so many levels of that.\n\n36:55.120 --> 37:00.400\n You've said before that winning is everything and that means people lose.\n\n37:00.400 --> 37:06.080\n Most people lose, you know, there's really in whatever the context is only one winner.\n\n37:06.080 --> 37:10.800\n In many parts of our world today, outside of wrestling, that concept, the brutal honesty\n\n37:10.800 --> 37:12.800\n of that is uncomfortable for people.\n\n37:12.800 --> 37:23.120\n So, how do you think about this very philosophical, difficult concept of, you know, there only\n\n37:23.120 --> 37:27.920\n being one winner, that winning is everything, this kind of really painful idea?\n\n37:27.920 --> 37:31.920\n I don't think that that's a bad thing to have that mentality.\n\n37:31.920 --> 37:36.240\n I mean, I think Akutukov, I remember a story I read about him.\n\n37:36.240 --> 37:37.200\n He comes to mind.\n\n37:37.200 --> 37:45.120\n You know, Sargush, I remember when he lost in London and I remember the look on his face.\n\n37:45.120 --> 37:49.360\n And those are some of the greatest wrestlers in the history of the sport, freestyle wrestling.\n\n37:49.360 --> 37:52.080\n And, you know what?\n\n37:52.080 --> 37:53.120\n It's what works for you.\n\n37:54.160 --> 38:00.240\n You can talk about being at peace with your results and that the approach is and the journey\n\n38:00.240 --> 38:01.200\n is what it's about.\n\n38:01.200 --> 38:07.200\n But, and that's great and that relaxes some champions and that makes some champions really,\n\n38:07.200 --> 38:10.560\n really tick, but not everybody.\n\n38:11.520 --> 38:14.400\n So, it's okay, it's okay.\n\n38:14.400 --> 38:20.240\n And if that wigs you out and that really makes you uptight, then go the other route.\n\n38:20.240 --> 38:22.160\n You have to find what works for you.\n\n38:22.160 --> 38:23.120\n And that takes a lot of work.\n\n38:23.120 --> 38:26.960\n If you're lazy, forget it, forget it.\n\n38:26.960 --> 38:33.360\n So, you and Terry, but in general, how do you find the line between extremely physical,\n\n38:33.360 --> 38:37.040\n extreme physical wrestling and rough wrestling or angry wrestling?\n\n38:37.040 --> 38:41.040\n So, to which degree has anger, whether it's in your wrestling room these days or in your\n\n38:41.040 --> 38:43.280\n own career, entered wrestling?\n\n38:43.280 --> 38:47.440\n Do you see it as a tool that can be used in the wrestling match?\n\n38:47.440 --> 38:50.400\n I think there's a balance or not even a balance.\n\n38:50.400 --> 38:52.880\n There's a lot of balance in the wrestling world.\n\n38:52.880 --> 38:58.880\n I think there's a balance or not even a balance, there's a line that you go up to and you can't\n\n38:58.880 --> 38:59.760\n cross it.\n\n38:59.760 --> 39:01.040\n Sportsmanship is everything.\n\n39:01.040 --> 39:02.640\n You can get dinged for points.\n\n39:02.640 --> 39:05.520\n You can get thrown out of tournaments.\n\n39:05.520 --> 39:12.080\n There's rules with flagrant misconduct where you're kicked out of the match, other team\n\n39:12.080 --> 39:14.800\n gets the points and then you have to sit the next meet.\n\n39:15.840 --> 39:17.200\n So, it's very serious.\n\n39:17.200 --> 39:22.720\n The NCAA sends a message, a very serious message about sportsmanship.\n\n39:22.720 --> 39:23.120\n Yeah.\n\n39:23.120 --> 39:24.640\n And so, we talk about that.\n\n39:24.640 --> 39:27.200\n The other thing with wrestling is there's rules in wrestling.\n\n39:27.760 --> 39:34.240\n These guys that are tough guys outside of the rules, that's what you want in your opponent.\n\n39:34.240 --> 39:35.280\n That means they're frustrated.\n\n39:38.480 --> 39:42.480\n You got to be a tough guy inside the rules of the sport.\n\n39:43.680 --> 39:47.760\n That's more honorable than cold cocking somebody and knocking them out.\n\n39:47.760 --> 39:49.840\n So, yeah, anger doesn't mean breaking the rules.\n\n39:49.840 --> 39:53.840\n But I mean, you know, a lot of people know you just watching you as a coach.\n\n39:54.640 --> 39:56.160\n There's quite a bit of passion there.\n\n39:56.160 --> 39:58.000\n Well, come and do what you're doing tonight.\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:01.920\n I mean, break bread with me in my kitchen and see how big of a jackass I am.\n\n40:01.920 --> 40:03.040\n Now, you're a pretty nice guy.\n\n40:03.040 --> 40:05.600\n Well, I'm not asking for that necessarily, but thanks.\n\n40:05.600 --> 40:12.080\n I'm saying, you know what, as a coach, I mean, okay, come spend a month in our program and\n\n40:12.080 --> 40:15.600\n you'll see really what kind of people we are.\n\n40:15.600 --> 40:20.000\n And there's a stigma out there because they are very threatened by our program.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:25.520\n There's nobody else that threatens the sport of wrestling like we do.\n\n40:25.520 --> 40:26.320\n And that's the truth.\n\n40:26.960 --> 40:29.360\n There's a legend to Iowa wrestling.\n\n40:29.360 --> 40:31.920\n There's one of the most intimidating.\n\n40:31.920 --> 40:34.240\n There's a legend to John Smith.\n\n40:34.240 --> 40:35.120\n It's the same thing.\n\n40:35.840 --> 40:37.680\n They get up for John Smith.\n\n40:37.680 --> 40:39.040\n They get up for Oklahoma State.\n\n40:39.920 --> 40:41.360\n They get up for Penn State.\n\n40:42.880 --> 40:44.800\n My question is, okay, I'll answer it.\n\n40:44.800 --> 40:45.680\n I'll answer it this way.\n\n40:45.680 --> 40:48.160\n I'll give you an example in my coaching career.\n\n40:48.160 --> 40:50.320\n I coached at Virginia Tech for 22 months.\n\n40:52.240 --> 40:54.240\n We recruited the number one recruiting class.\n\n40:54.960 --> 41:00.160\n We got the administration to change 100% 180 how they looked at wrestling.\n\n41:00.800 --> 41:01.600\n Here's the thing.\n\n41:01.600 --> 41:05.200\n And because of how serious we were and because we weren't idiots,\n\n41:06.960 --> 41:09.120\n we were able to do that with our administration.\n\n41:09.120 --> 41:12.480\n But my point is this, we tried to win.\n\n41:12.480 --> 41:14.080\n We tried to win, even at Virginia Tech.\n\n41:14.080 --> 41:15.520\n It wasn't a stepping stone for me.\n\n41:15.520 --> 41:18.880\n It ended up being one quickly and looking back on it.\n\n41:18.880 --> 41:21.680\n I was a fool to think that I'd be there for 20 years.\n\n41:21.680 --> 41:23.120\n But you believed you would be.\n\n41:23.120 --> 41:23.600\n I did.\n\n41:23.600 --> 41:24.160\n Yeah, I did.\n\n41:25.600 --> 41:26.100\n I did.\n\n41:26.640 --> 41:31.520\n So do you remember a time that you really pushed yourself to your limits?\n\n41:32.320 --> 41:35.040\n So Gable talks about having to be carried off the mat.\n\n41:35.760 --> 41:37.600\n Have you really found that level?\n\n41:37.600 --> 41:41.280\n I said something about that too in a book and I think I was mistaken.\n\n41:41.280 --> 41:43.440\n A book and I think I was misquoted one time.\n\n41:44.400 --> 41:45.920\n And actually it was Gable's quote.\n\n41:45.920 --> 41:50.560\n And I was trying to make the point that Gable's quote was like this.\n\n41:50.560 --> 41:53.440\n And they were making it like it was my own words.\n\n41:53.440 --> 41:57.760\n I think it was a first wrestling tough book, but it's a good book.\n\n41:58.720 --> 42:00.240\n But the story is Gable's.\n\n42:00.960 --> 42:05.440\n And I don't know if there's anybody that has done that besides him.\n\n42:06.560 --> 42:08.960\n And I think that's a very rare quality.\n\n42:08.960 --> 42:16.960\n But I've definitely been in that nirvana level of, you know, you could go all day long.\n\n42:17.920 --> 42:20.720\n And it doesn't, you have to shoot me to stop me.\n\n42:20.720 --> 42:21.220\n Yeah.\n\n42:21.680 --> 42:25.760\n But there's a balance because you're not going hard with and holding your breath.\n\n42:25.760 --> 42:34.320\n It's not a, it's a relaxed and like you got a guy cornered and who's most dangerous?\n\n42:34.880 --> 42:36.400\n Well, the guy that's cornered.\n\n42:36.400 --> 42:39.120\n And so that's where you relax, I'm not bum rushing him.\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:40.960\n I'm relaxed.\n\n42:40.960 --> 42:43.120\n I'm still moving, fake and very fluid.\n\n42:43.120 --> 42:44.080\n Guy falls down his face.\n\n42:44.080 --> 42:45.120\n I run around behind him.\n\n42:45.680 --> 42:46.640\n That's offense.\n\n42:47.680 --> 42:51.760\n You don't have to just grunt to the leg and call that offense.\n\n42:52.320 --> 42:56.080\n Offense is a in and out, smooth.\n\n42:56.080 --> 42:57.920\n Now you sound like a Russian wrestler.\n\n42:58.640 --> 42:59.140\n Yeah.\n\n42:59.140 --> 43:04.240\n Well, that's, they're the best in a certain light, looking at the history of wrestling.\n\n43:04.240 --> 43:07.360\n Wrestling is much bigger than folk style, freestyle, Greco.\n\n43:07.840 --> 43:10.800\n It's, it's one of the oldest forms of combat period.\n\n43:11.360 --> 43:14.000\n There's been cave drawings 15,000 years ago.\n\n43:14.560 --> 43:19.600\n Do you ever see, so you're, you're, uh, one of the great coaches of all time.\n\n43:19.600 --> 43:23.760\n You're now focused on a particular rule style right now, but do you ever see wrestling\n\n43:23.760 --> 43:29.840\n as bigger than all of the, this, you know, as, as, uh, one of the pure combats?\n\n43:29.840 --> 43:34.960\n I do, and we're raising $20 million for a facility to make it the best facility on the planet.\n\n43:34.960 --> 43:40.640\n We have a vision to build the best facility on planet earth and put the best wrestlers in it.\n\n43:41.520 --> 43:43.920\n And that is bigger than wrestling.\n\n43:45.040 --> 43:52.000\n It's for the university of Iowa and our donors are doing it for the university of Iowa, but it is\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:55.600\n about the value of wrestling to me.\n\n43:55.600 --> 44:01.600\n Also, there is so much value to wrestling blind, blind people don't play football.\n\n44:01.600 --> 44:04.240\n They wrestle blind people, don't play basketball.\n\n44:04.240 --> 44:08.080\n I mean, maybe they do, but it'd be very difficult.\n\n44:08.080 --> 44:09.120\n They can wrestle.\n\n44:09.920 --> 44:11.760\n Wrestling is a field sport.\n\n44:12.800 --> 44:12.800\n Yeah.\n\n44:12.800 --> 44:13.600\n There's no ball.\n\n44:13.600 --> 44:14.080\n There's nothing.\n\n44:14.080 --> 44:16.720\n It's just two guys or two girls and that's it.\n\n44:16.720 --> 44:17.360\n That's right.\n\n44:17.360 --> 44:21.920\n And, and you, I mean, I'm not going to say you can't because somebody will get a hold of this\n\n44:21.920 --> 44:26.800\n and I'll get an email or a letter that says, you said blind people can't play baseball and blah, blah.\n\n44:27.520 --> 44:31.040\n I'm just saying that blind people can wrestle very effectively.\n\n44:31.040 --> 44:31.520\n Yes.\n\n44:31.520 --> 44:33.280\n I've wrestled with, with my eyes shut.\n\n44:33.280 --> 44:34.880\n I mean, was honest about it too.\n\n44:35.920 --> 44:37.680\n And it was, I was effective.\n\n44:38.240 --> 44:40.080\n So why, why was I able to be effective?\n\n44:40.080 --> 44:47.280\n Because wrestling is a, is a, is a sport that you, you can overcome a lot, your demons that\n\n44:47.280 --> 44:54.400\n you're overcoming, they're not limited with whether I'm blind or not.\n\n44:54.400 --> 44:56.400\n The demons that are overcoming are inside you.\n\n44:56.400 --> 44:58.160\n You have to overcome those demons from within.\n\n44:59.600 --> 45:04.800\n So what's the future of Iowa wrestling look like with this facility and this momentum you have now\n\n45:04.800 --> 45:06.560\n and this great group of guys you have now?\n\n45:06.560 --> 45:14.560\n We have a good young group of guys and, um, you know, there is a lot of buzz in the program.\n\n45:14.560 --> 45:17.520\n And probably hasn't been this much buzz for quite some time.\n\n45:18.560 --> 45:26.960\n And our job is to, you know, be relaxed and be focused and not get caught up in the buzz.\n\n45:27.680 --> 45:32.240\n Um, but we have to put it together and we have a catalyst Spencer Lee, but he's going to have to,\n\n45:32.240 --> 45:33.600\n he's going to have to get better.\n\n45:34.400 --> 45:39.680\n And we have some other catalysts as well that are, um, you know, going to help us in the future.\n\n45:39.680 --> 45:44.480\n Um, but they got to get better.\n\n45:44.480 --> 45:51.520\n And so all this stuff about independence and accountability and, you know, being able to\n\n45:51.520 --> 45:59.200\n get better every day under duress and not knowing that you're getting better, but you are, you know,\n\n45:59.200 --> 46:00.720\n you know what that, you know what I mean by that?\n\n46:01.280 --> 46:05.920\n Like the great thing about Gabo was wrestling for him was, is you were getting better and\n\n46:05.920 --> 46:07.280\n you didn't know you were getting better.\n\n46:07.280 --> 46:10.800\n Well, yeah, just like you said, uh, grow from success.\n\n46:10.800 --> 46:16.400\n So even you, you never allow yourself to think that you're, that you're, you're getting good.\n\n46:16.400 --> 46:20.000\n All of a sudden you do something in the practice room that you've been working on and all of a\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:22.240\n sudden you hit it and it's like, it was automatic.\n\n46:22.240 --> 46:26.640\n And then that, you know, yeah, that multiplies success.\n\n46:26.640 --> 46:31.840\n And so if I may say, so you're a bit of a man of the Bible.\n\n46:31.840 --> 46:39.760\n What's, where do you go, what do you go to the Bible for your faith, strength, love, patience?\n\n46:39.760 --> 46:41.920\n I talked about things that you can't control.\n\n46:41.920 --> 46:42.720\n You turn them over.\n\n46:43.520 --> 46:48.320\n So the biggest thing for me is I got to turn over the things that I can't control, turn them over\n\n46:49.280 --> 46:52.080\n to that power and I'm going to be a lot better off.\n\n46:52.080 --> 46:57.040\n And that's the reason why I'm not in the funny farm because very competitive to me.\n\n46:57.760 --> 46:58.240\n Yeah.\n\n46:58.240 --> 47:05.760\n It's very serious that we, we know that these young wrestlers come to school here to be the\n\n47:05.760 --> 47:11.280\n best that they can be and to accomplish goals that like me, when I was young, they've set out\n\n47:11.280 --> 47:14.480\n to accomplish and they chose Iowa to do that.\n\n47:14.480 --> 47:15.600\n So we have to deliver.\n\n47:16.560 --> 47:26.320\n And because of that, um, peace with God, you know, it's peer, it's a peer motivation.\n\n47:26.320 --> 47:31.360\n It's a peer motivation and it's a peer platform.\n\n47:31.360 --> 47:34.800\n It's not, it's not doing this for my ego.\n\n47:36.080 --> 47:37.360\n We're not corrupt people.\n\n47:37.920 --> 47:39.520\n We're not liars and cheaters.\n\n47:40.320 --> 47:45.200\n And so often that gets in the way of a decent person.\n\n47:46.320 --> 47:46.560\n Yeah.\n\n47:46.560 --> 47:50.160\n First and foremost, you're a good person and God helps you be that.\n\n47:50.880 --> 47:51.040\n Yeah.\n\n47:51.040 --> 47:52.320\n And we're serious about wrestling.\n\n47:52.320 --> 47:52.820\n Right.\n\n47:55.920 --> 47:57.920\n So a couple more questions.\n\n47:58.480 --> 48:01.280\n What's the role of family in wrestling?\n\n48:01.280 --> 48:08.960\n You mentioned your wife, who I read, uh, turned you down when you asked her for a phone number,\n\n48:08.960 --> 48:10.400\n said it's in the phone book.\n\n48:10.400 --> 48:11.680\n That's pretty smooth.\n\n48:11.680 --> 48:16.720\n Her story of that is that she didn't want me to have to remember the number.\n\n48:16.720 --> 48:21.280\n And I say at this point, and I say, there's no way.\n\n48:21.280 --> 48:24.320\n And I remember it very clearly like, Hey, it's in the phone book.\n\n48:24.320 --> 48:25.840\n And I was like, okay, she's blowing me off.\n\n48:25.840 --> 48:26.320\n That's okay.\n\n48:28.240 --> 48:30.960\n But luckily here's the thing with family.\n\n48:30.960 --> 48:33.440\n I mean, we, we have great people in our program.\n\n48:33.440 --> 48:34.720\n We have great parents.\n\n48:34.720 --> 48:38.640\n We have a culture of parents that that's part of the buzz.\n\n48:39.760 --> 48:43.440\n And this class that you see wrestling right now, that's been here a year now,\n\n48:43.440 --> 48:49.040\n um, Lee, Mirren, Costello, Warner, and then Lugo was a transfer and I'm forgetting somebody.\n\n48:49.040 --> 48:53.360\n I don't want to forget anybody, but, um, these parents are phenomenal.\n\n48:53.360 --> 48:55.200\n And that's a different parental culture.\n\n48:56.560 --> 49:02.560\n Um, so the Kemmerer's dad is the same and, and, um, so there's a lot of good there.\n\n49:02.560 --> 49:07.840\n And that, that's a big, that's a big, a big move because how we talk to parents, we don't\n\n49:07.840 --> 49:10.160\n talk to parents to get along with them.\n\n49:10.160 --> 49:14.720\n We talk to parents to help them understand, you know, where we're at with their sons.\n\n49:15.680 --> 49:21.200\n And when you can have a direct conversation with a parent who helping his son or her son,\n\n49:21.200 --> 49:28.160\n the mom helping her son to be accountable and to own it, then you can get a lot accomplished.\n\n49:28.160 --> 49:29.680\n And that's what we've been able to do.\n\n49:29.680 --> 49:31.120\n And so you're solving problems.\n\n49:31.120 --> 49:34.560\n Like I talked about earlier, um, that's part of the family.\n\n49:34.560 --> 49:38.960\n The other part of the family is the coaches, um, are like family.\n\n49:38.960 --> 49:44.480\n The other part of the family is the coaches, uh, significant others and wives are part\n\n49:44.480 --> 49:45.520\n of the family.\n\n49:45.520 --> 49:52.720\n And we fed, you know, we fed 40 guys and an entire coaching staff and wives and their\n\n49:52.720 --> 49:56.720\n children here at Thanksgiving, and that equals 70 people.\n\n49:57.520 --> 49:59.520\n And it's, it's fun.\n\n50:00.240 --> 50:00.720\n It's fun.\n\n50:01.360 --> 50:04.320\n So family means administration.\n\n50:04.320 --> 50:09.600\n Gary Varda, my, my athletic director gives us everything that we need to be successful.\n\n50:09.600 --> 50:14.240\n And he has an open mind for, for the sport of wrestling and wrestling is important in\n\n50:14.240 --> 50:14.720\n Iowa.\n\n50:14.720 --> 50:20.000\n So that's a no brainer, but not if you're not a wrestling guy, but he sees we do it\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:20.720\n the right way.\n\n50:20.720 --> 50:23.200\n And so the commitment is there from him.\n\n50:23.200 --> 50:27.280\n If we were doofuses, you know, he, the commitment wouldn't be there.\n\n50:28.320 --> 50:32.320\n So family is, everybody's all in, I mean, it's from the wrestlers to the family.\n\n50:32.320 --> 50:35.200\n It goes back to what I said earlier about our people.\n\n50:35.200 --> 50:36.080\n Our people are great.\n\n50:36.080 --> 50:37.680\n Ryan Morty Star is great.\n\n50:37.680 --> 50:38.880\n Bobby Telford is great.\n\n50:39.760 --> 50:43.120\n Bobby Telford took over for a guy named Ben Burhow, who is great.\n\n50:44.320 --> 50:45.840\n Our medical team is great.\n\n50:45.840 --> 50:51.360\n Dr. Westerman, Dr. Wolf, Jesse Donaworth, our athletic trainer is great.\n\n50:53.360 --> 50:55.200\n Terry Brands is great.\n\n50:55.200 --> 50:59.040\n Mariah Stickley and, and Elise Owens, our managers are great.\n\n50:59.040 --> 51:00.240\n My daughter's a manager as well.\n\n51:00.240 --> 51:00.800\n It's great.\n\n51:00.800 --> 51:03.120\n They're, they're hardworking young women.\n\n51:03.120 --> 51:09.120\n Our rest, our Hawkeye Wrestling Club is, is where it needs to be in terms of how they\n\n51:09.120 --> 51:11.360\n help in their role.\n\n51:11.360 --> 51:15.360\n And now we have four women in there and that's great.\n\n51:16.240 --> 51:20.480\n And, you know, at least one of their dads is super involved with us.\n\n51:20.480 --> 51:26.880\n But, and so it's, one thing that I've learned is that you have to have that.\n\n51:26.880 --> 51:30.720\n And if you don't have that, then you have to address it quickly.\n\n51:31.440 --> 51:34.240\n And those outliers, you know, let's solve that problem.\n\n51:34.240 --> 51:35.600\n Let's get it out in the open here.\n\n51:36.320 --> 51:38.960\n And if they're, you know, if it doesn't work out, it's not going to work out.\n\n51:39.840 --> 51:41.520\n That's a heck of a Thanksgiving dinner.\n\n51:42.400 --> 51:42.720\n Yeah.\n\n51:42.720 --> 51:43.200\n Next year.\n\n51:43.200 --> 51:48.000\n Well, I don't know if it'd be legal, but I'd have to check with our compliance and, you\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:49.280\n know, they'd have to vet you.\n\n51:49.840 --> 51:52.640\n You could come, you can come and see what it's all about.\n\n51:52.640 --> 51:54.000\n This room is full.\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:57.280\n Oh man.\n\n51:57.280 --> 51:58.960\n Well, yeah, I'll be back next year then.\n\n51:58.960 --> 51:59.440\n All right.\n\n51:59.440 --> 51:59.920\n Awesome.\n\n52:00.400 --> 52:01.200\n Last question.\n\n52:01.200 --> 52:10.320\n In 2014, I watched this video four years ago of you competing in, I believe, your first\n\n52:10.320 --> 52:13.520\n swim meet against your brother, Terry.\n\n52:14.880 --> 52:16.240\n And you came out victorious.\n\n52:17.200 --> 52:17.920\n Not really.\n\n52:18.880 --> 52:19.200\n Okay.\n\n52:19.200 --> 52:21.360\n So let's, did you cheat?\n\n52:21.360 --> 52:22.400\n Here's what happened.\n\n52:22.400 --> 52:26.640\n I had researched this thing because I'm, that's how I am.\n\n52:26.640 --> 52:27.600\n You practiced.\n\n52:27.600 --> 52:28.320\n No, I didn't.\n\n52:28.320 --> 52:29.120\n But I researched it.\n\n52:29.120 --> 52:34.160\n In swimming, if you flinch on that starter block, it's a false start.\n\n52:34.160 --> 52:38.800\n You can't twitch a finger and because they would be doing that to get their buddy to\n\n52:38.800 --> 52:40.560\n move or the guy next to him, you know?\n\n52:40.560 --> 52:43.280\n So you have to be rock solid.\n\n52:43.280 --> 52:47.280\n Well, when we went, Terry was leaning forward as the gun was going off.\n\n52:47.280 --> 52:48.240\n So he's moving.\n\n52:48.240 --> 52:51.360\n And so I was like, no, no, no, false start, no, no, no, no.\n\n52:51.360 --> 52:52.080\n And he couldn't hear me.\n\n52:52.080 --> 52:53.280\n It was already in the water.\n\n52:53.280 --> 52:57.920\n And so he took off like a bat out of you know where for the end of the pool and couldn't\n\n52:57.920 --> 53:00.640\n hear me and got to the end of the pool and it was a down and back.\n\n53:01.360 --> 53:04.720\n Well, that's a hard thing to do with a guy with no body fat.\n\n53:05.280 --> 53:09.360\n And so he burned a lot of energy and he come up on that end of the pool and he was like,\n\n53:09.360 --> 53:10.160\n where's, where's he at?\n\n53:10.160 --> 53:10.800\n Cause he didn't see me.\n\n53:11.760 --> 53:15.600\n And so we stopped him and then he came back and then we went another one and I beat him.\n\n53:15.600 --> 53:21.040\n Um, but it's the only time that, you know, I would say that he was tuckered out.\n\n53:21.040 --> 53:22.000\n And that's the reason why.\n\n53:22.720 --> 53:31.920\n And, um, I'll also say this, we did a time where we timed my race, the one I won, and\n\n53:31.920 --> 53:34.640\n then we timed his first down to the wall.\n\n53:35.200 --> 53:39.440\n And then we timed his, the actual race where once he hit the wall, we timed him on the\n\n53:39.440 --> 53:41.040\n way back and he'd beat me.\n\n53:42.080 --> 53:42.880\n That's the only time.\n\n53:42.880 --> 53:45.600\n The way back and he'd beat me now.\n\n53:45.600 --> 53:48.320\n How's that for being a, that's pretty honest.\n\n53:48.320 --> 53:49.520\n That's pretty honest.\n\n53:49.520 --> 53:50.480\n Accountable.\n\n53:50.480 --> 53:51.200\n Wow.\n\n53:51.200 --> 53:51.600\n Person.\n\n53:52.320 --> 53:53.440\n And I'm going to tell you something else.\n\n53:53.440 --> 53:55.680\n Getting in those shorts, those swim trunks.\n\n53:55.680 --> 53:56.400\n That's impressive.\n\n53:56.400 --> 53:57.520\n They are tight.\n\n53:57.520 --> 53:57.760\n Yeah.\n\n53:58.400 --> 54:05.120\n So is there, outside of wrestling, is there a thing that Terry got the better of you?\n\n54:05.120 --> 54:10.320\n I mean, I guess this could count as one, uh, that you're still really bitter about that\n\n54:10.320 --> 54:11.280\n you need to avenge.\n\n54:11.280 --> 54:12.400\n I mean, that's past.\n\n54:12.400 --> 54:14.480\n I mean, we, he's got an UNO title.\n\n54:14.480 --> 54:16.800\n We have UNO world championships.\n\n54:16.800 --> 54:17.920\n He's got an UNO title.\n\n54:17.920 --> 54:19.600\n I have, I have yet to have one.\n\n54:19.600 --> 54:21.360\n Morningstar has two titles.\n\n54:21.360 --> 54:22.480\n That's unprecedented.\n\n54:23.680 --> 54:26.960\n So there's only four trophies out there and Terry's got one of those and I don't have\n\n54:26.960 --> 54:27.440\n one yet.\n\n54:27.440 --> 54:27.920\n Yeah.\n\n54:27.920 --> 54:28.720\n Well, it's still time.\n\n54:29.520 --> 54:33.200\n Tom, thank you so much for letting a Russian with a tie into your home.\n\n54:34.160 --> 54:36.640\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tom Brands.\n\n54:36.640 --> 54:40.400\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n54:40.400 --> 54:44.560\n And now let me leave you with some words from Marcus Aurelius.\n\n54:45.280 --> 54:49.360\n The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing.\n\n54:49.360 --> 55:10.400\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
