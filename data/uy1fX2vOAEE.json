He represented the United States at four Olympics\n\n00:08.580 --> 00:12.140\n in 92, 96, 2000, and 2004,\n\n00:12.140 --> 00:14.680\n winning a bronze medal at two of them.\n\n00:14.680 --> 00:17.480\n He medaled in three world championships,\n\n00:17.480 --> 00:20.080\n winning gold in 1999.\n\n00:20.080 --> 00:23.640\n He has coached many of the elite level American judoka,\n\n00:23.640 --> 00:26.100\n including Kayla Harrison, Ronda Rousey,\n\n00:26.100 --> 00:28.460\n Travis Stevens, and many others.\n\n00:28.460 --> 00:32.880\n Plus, he's now my judo coach, along with Travis Stevens.\n\n00:32.880 --> 00:34.920\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:34.920 --> 00:36.920\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:36.920 --> 00:38.320\n in the description.\n\n00:38.320 --> 00:42.240\n And now, here's my conversation with Jimmy Pedro.\n\n00:43.160 --> 00:46.600\n What is the most beautiful throw in judo to you?\n\n00:47.720 --> 00:49.320\n I think Uchi Mata.\n\n00:49.320 --> 00:51.080\n You know, it's the one that seems\n\n00:51.080 --> 00:52.560\n to have the most amplitude.\n\n00:52.560 --> 00:54.440\n That person goes the highest,\n\n00:54.440 --> 00:57.220\n you see a leg swing through the middle,\n\n00:57.220 --> 00:59.160\n the person doing the throw, there's a leg swinging\n\n00:59.160 --> 01:01.520\n through the middle, the other person definitely goes,\n\n01:01.520 --> 01:04.720\n you know, head over heels, flat on their back.\n\n01:04.720 --> 01:08.120\n It's probably the most dynamic, pretty judo throw there is.\n\n01:08.120 --> 01:11.120\n Okay, so it's a single, you're standing on a single foot\n\n01:11.120 --> 01:13.200\n and you're raising your other foot in the air\n\n01:13.200 --> 01:16.680\n and it's a forward throw, which means the,\n\n01:16.680 --> 01:19.540\n your back is facing the opponent,\n\n01:19.540 --> 01:23.080\n but they kind of both fly through the air\n\n01:23.080 --> 01:24.520\n and twist through the air.\n\n01:24.520 --> 01:25.560\n Correct.\n\n01:25.560 --> 01:28.400\n Yeah, so how does that throw work?\n\n01:28.400 --> 01:30.400\n What are the principles behind that throw?\n\n01:30.400 --> 01:33.440\n Is one of those throws that, you know,\n\n01:33.440 --> 01:35.900\n people can kind of understand how to pick up\n\n01:35.900 --> 01:38.720\n another human being in sort of trivial ways,\n\n01:38.720 --> 01:42.060\n but the Uchi Mata to me never quite made sense,\n\n01:42.060 --> 01:43.820\n like why it works.\n\n01:43.820 --> 01:47.360\n There's a cork, there's a twisting motion,\n\n01:47.360 --> 01:49.720\n there's some involvement of the hip,\n\n01:49.720 --> 01:52.920\n but not, it's not really a hip throw\n\n01:52.920 --> 01:55.600\n because the hip is not all the way over,\n\n01:55.600 --> 01:58.400\n so it's not, it's a very confusing throw to me.\n\n01:58.400 --> 02:00.920\n So I'm trying to say, can you say something through words?\n\n02:00.920 --> 02:02.680\n It's probably one of the most difficult throws\n\n02:02.680 --> 02:04.980\n to learn as well, because it is so complex.\n\n02:04.980 --> 02:07.880\n You do have to stand on one leg, balance on one leg,\n\n02:07.880 --> 02:10.040\n you know, swing your other leg through the middle,\n\n02:10.040 --> 02:12.040\n hold your opponent up in the air,\n\n02:12.040 --> 02:16.080\n and it's hard to, it's hard to make that contact\n\n02:16.080 --> 02:18.400\n with upper body to your back.\n\n02:18.400 --> 02:20.480\n You know, you have to turn your back on the throw as well.\n\n02:20.480 --> 02:22.640\n So how does it work?\n\n02:22.640 --> 02:24.880\n It's definitely sort of a throw\n\n02:24.880 --> 02:28.880\n where you need to start pulling your opponent's upper body\n\n02:28.880 --> 02:30.440\n towards you, right?\n\n02:30.440 --> 02:32.620\n So their upper body starts coming towards you.\n\n02:32.620 --> 02:35.120\n Your legs go towards them\n\n02:35.120 --> 02:38.400\n as your body starts to go into the throw.\n\n02:38.400 --> 02:40.880\n So your head is gonna go left, let's say,\n\n02:40.880 --> 02:43.600\n your body, your legs are gonna go to the right,\n\n02:43.600 --> 02:47.340\n your body's, your partner's gonna start to lean towards you.\n\n02:47.340 --> 02:48.920\n And just as you start to get there,\n\n02:48.920 --> 02:50.520\n momentum coming forward,\n\n02:50.520 --> 02:53.360\n your leg is gonna sweep up underneath theirs,\n\n02:53.360 --> 02:55.240\n pick them up onto your hip, right,\n\n02:55.240 --> 02:57.280\n and then the finish of the throw is a twist.\n\n02:57.280 --> 02:59.240\n And a lot of times, the good judoka\n\n02:59.240 --> 03:01.560\n will leave their feet when they do the throw,\n\n03:01.560 --> 03:04.040\n so both bodies are in the air together,\n\n03:04.040 --> 03:05.600\n and then the thrower comes down\n\n03:05.600 --> 03:07.520\n on top of the person being thrown.\n\n03:07.520 --> 03:09.280\n So all four feet are in the air.\n\n03:09.280 --> 03:10.120\n Correct.\n\n03:10.120 --> 03:12.280\n So there's just this unstoppable force that's,\n\n03:12.280 --> 03:13.720\n so you're all in the air.\n\n03:13.720 --> 03:15.800\n You're basically doing a roll together.\n\n03:15.800 --> 03:17.400\n Correct.\n\n03:17.400 --> 03:21.680\n Okay, so who, to you, is the best uchimata,\n\n03:21.680 --> 03:23.800\n who has, besides yourself, the...\n\n03:23.800 --> 03:27.640\n I'm not gonna lie, there's plenty of guys\n\n03:27.640 --> 03:29.800\n that do uchimata a lot better than I do.\n\n03:29.800 --> 03:31.800\n You do have a nice video about the uchimata online,\n\n03:31.800 --> 03:36.120\n but who is a great practitioner of the uchimata to you?\n\n03:36.120 --> 03:39.720\n Right now, Shohei Ono, who's two time Olympic gold medalist,\n\n03:39.720 --> 03:40.920\n that's his favorite throw,\n\n03:40.920 --> 03:44.320\n and there's tons of highlight videos on the IGF\n\n03:44.320 --> 03:47.680\n and judo fanatics showing how he does his uchimata,\n\n03:47.680 --> 03:50.520\n and it is quite different than everybody else's,\n\n03:50.520 --> 03:51.680\n but it's unstoppable.\n\n03:51.680 --> 03:53.360\n When he comes in, nobody stops it.\n\n03:53.360 --> 03:55.960\n He's won two golds in a row at the Olympics.\n\n03:55.960 --> 03:57.440\n I think maybe in the last eight years,\n\n03:57.440 --> 03:59.280\n the guy's lost two matches.\n\n03:59.280 --> 04:00.840\n He's just incredible.\n\n04:00.840 --> 04:05.040\n At a very competitive division, I guess 73 kilos?\n\n04:05.040 --> 04:08.640\n Okay, and then three time world champ too.\n\n04:08.640 --> 04:10.960\n Is he the greatest of all time to you?\n\n04:10.960 --> 04:14.520\n The only reason why he's not is because Nomura\n\n04:14.520 --> 04:15.840\n is a 60 kilo player.\n\n04:15.840 --> 04:18.360\n He was three time Olympic champion,\n\n04:18.360 --> 04:21.400\n so Nomura, I mean, unless Ono's gonna stick around\n\n04:21.400 --> 04:26.400\n for another three years and win again here in Paris,\n\n04:26.560 --> 04:28.200\n then he'd match what Nomura did,\n\n04:28.200 --> 04:30.360\n but three time gold medalist in judo\n\n04:30.360 --> 04:34.200\n in a lightweight division, that's pretty spectacular.\n\n04:34.200 --> 04:38.680\n So to you, being able to win a championship,\n\n04:38.680 --> 04:41.840\n world championship, or Olympic medal\n\n04:41.840 --> 04:43.920\n is a measure of greatness.\n\n04:43.920 --> 04:46.960\n It's not like you have some people\n\n04:46.960 --> 04:49.920\n who are not as accomplished like Koga or something like that,\n\n04:49.920 --> 04:54.920\n but just the beauty, the moments of magic,\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.600\n the number of moments of magic is the highest,\n\n04:57.600 --> 04:59.480\n even if it's not championships.\n\n04:59.480 --> 05:00.960\n I think you have to go by that\n\n05:00.960 --> 05:04.040\n because there's so many phenomenal judo players\n\n05:04.040 --> 05:07.240\n that have come through the system of spectacular judo.\n\n05:07.240 --> 05:11.600\n You have won countless major events,\n\n05:11.600 --> 05:14.040\n but the ability to pull it together,\n\n05:14.040 --> 05:16.520\n those magical moments, the pinnacle of the sport,\n\n05:16.520 --> 05:18.760\n the world championships, the Olympic games,\n\n05:18.760 --> 05:21.600\n and proving that you can do it time and time again\n\n05:21.600 --> 05:24.440\n makes you unstoppable, it makes you the best.\n\n05:24.440 --> 05:28.480\n There was a guy back in the 70s and 80s by the name of Fuji\n\n05:28.480 --> 05:32.320\n and he won four world championships back to back.\n\n05:32.320 --> 05:35.060\n And back then, the Worlds was every two years.\n\n05:35.060 --> 05:37.640\n So here he was, a four time world champion.\n\n05:37.640 --> 05:39.980\n That's eight years the top of the sport.\n\n05:39.980 --> 05:43.740\n He never won an Olympic medal.\n\n05:43.740 --> 05:45.580\n He never went to the Olympics.\n\n05:45.580 --> 05:48.860\n So there's a guy who missed out on Olympic greatness,\n\n05:48.860 --> 05:52.560\n but was arguably the best competitor back in that period.\n\n05:52.560 --> 05:55.520\n By the way, same Fuji as Fuji?\n\n05:55.520 --> 05:57.000\n Right.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:58.080\n Really, okay.\n\n05:58.080 --> 06:00.620\n Wow, I didn't know there was an actual guy, Fuji.\n\n06:00.620 --> 06:03.560\n Our brand is named after the mountain, Mount Fuji.\n\n06:03.560 --> 06:05.640\n But this is a different guy, his name was Fuji.\n\n06:05.640 --> 06:09.580\n All right, well, history rhymes.\n\n06:10.700 --> 06:13.360\n What about Teddy Renier?\n\n06:13.360 --> 06:15.440\n 10 time world champ, I think,\n\n06:15.440 --> 06:17.600\n two time gold medalist at the Olympics,\n\n06:17.600 --> 06:20.520\n two times bronze medalist at the Olympics.\n\n06:22.760 --> 06:26.360\n Probably the most dominant judoka ever.\n\n06:26.360 --> 06:27.300\n Is he in the running?\n\n06:27.300 --> 06:29.000\n What do you think about that guy?\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:32.160\n I think he's a freak of nature, Teddy.\n\n06:32.160 --> 06:35.560\n If you look at the size, just how tall he is,\n\n06:35.560 --> 06:38.680\n how big he is, how physical he is of a specimen.\n\n06:38.680 --> 06:40.640\n I sat next to him on a bus,\n\n06:40.640 --> 06:45.640\n and his legs are literally the size of my waist.\n\n06:45.960 --> 06:48.080\n When you sit next to him and just look at the size,\n\n06:48.080 --> 06:49.800\n he's a big man.\n\n06:49.800 --> 06:54.120\n So obviously to win 10 world titles in the sport of judo,\n\n06:54.120 --> 06:58.800\n I mean, that's almost an incomprehensible feat,\n\n06:58.800 --> 07:03.800\n two time Olympic champion, again, that puts him in one\n\n07:03.960 --> 07:06.800\n of the maybe 10 or 12 people to ever do that\n\n07:06.800 --> 07:08.160\n in the history of the sport.\n\n07:08.160 --> 07:11.520\n So he's definitely got to be in the running for the best.\n\n07:11.520 --> 07:15.600\n But technically, I don't think he's as technical\n\n07:15.600 --> 07:20.600\n as some of the other, in terms of pure judo finesse technique.\n\n07:21.880 --> 07:26.860\n He's powerful, he's explosive, he's dominant, he's strong.\n\n07:26.860 --> 07:29.000\n Teddy also grips really, really well,\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:32.400\n which makes him that much tougher to beat.\n\n07:32.400 --> 07:34.160\n Because a lot of times heavyweights,\n\n07:34.160 --> 07:35.080\n especially in the heavyweight division,\n\n07:35.080 --> 07:38.480\n a lot of them just grab the gi and they go man to man\n\n07:38.480 --> 07:41.280\n and judo to judo and take shots at each other.\n\n07:41.280 --> 07:43.600\n And that's why a lot of them end up getting beat.\n\n07:43.600 --> 07:45.900\n But Teddy's in control, like positionally,\n\n07:45.900 --> 07:47.880\n he stays in really good position\n\n07:47.880 --> 07:49.920\n and he controls his opponent the whole fight.\n\n07:49.920 --> 07:52.240\n So they really don't have a chance against them.\n\n07:52.240 --> 07:54.120\n He doesn't give them a chance to beat him,\n\n07:54.120 --> 07:55.640\n which is why he's been so dominant.\n\n07:55.640 --> 07:57.440\n But he's not really stalling.\n\n07:57.440 --> 08:01.800\n So I mean, he does have a really nice Osorogari,\n\n08:01.800 --> 08:06.800\n this backward trip, outside trip, in case people don't know.\n\n08:07.120 --> 08:11.320\n And he has just like technically pretty good throws\n\n08:11.320 --> 08:12.840\n for heavyweight.\n\n08:12.840 --> 08:16.880\n Heavyweights can be sometimes messy with their judo.\n\n08:16.880 --> 08:21.600\n He's pretty technical and clean\n\n08:21.600 --> 08:24.080\n in the execution of his big throws.\n\n08:24.080 --> 08:26.280\n But a lot of that probably has to do\n\n08:26.280 --> 08:28.360\n with the dominant gripping that he does.\n\n08:28.360 --> 08:30.640\n It's not defensive gripping, it's offensive gripping,\n\n08:30.640 --> 08:32.280\n but the dominant gripping.\n\n08:32.280 --> 08:33.120\n 100%.\n\n08:33.120 --> 08:36.040\n He controls the grips, he controls the movement\n\n08:36.040 --> 08:37.920\n of the match as a result of that,\n\n08:37.920 --> 08:39.720\n and then he creates his own openings.\n\n08:39.720 --> 08:43.320\n So I mean, for a heavyweight, phenomenal technique, yes.\n\n08:43.320 --> 08:46.400\n And what you said, messy, I'd like to call it sloppy, right?\n\n08:46.400 --> 08:49.460\n A lot of the heavyweights tend to be sloppy.\n\n08:49.460 --> 08:51.520\n They're falling on the ground a lot.\n\n08:51.520 --> 08:54.480\n It's hard to move somebody that weighs 350 pounds.\n\n08:54.480 --> 08:56.000\n It's hard to get that body moving\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.400\n and just with a simple pull motion.\n\n08:58.400 --> 09:00.920\n So he's definitely found a way to do it.\n\n09:00.920 --> 09:03.580\n But he's also, I don't know, six foot eight.\n\n09:03.580 --> 09:06.460\n He probably weighs 140 kilos.\n\n09:06.460 --> 09:07.820\n He's a big boy.\n\n09:07.820 --> 09:10.240\n But he had this winning streak of just,\n\n09:10.240 --> 09:13.040\n I don't know how long, but like over 100 matches.\n\n09:13.960 --> 09:17.440\n And he lost at this Olympics that we just went through,\n\n09:17.440 --> 09:20.300\n the 20, I don't even know what to call it, 2021 Olympics.\n\n09:20.300 --> 09:22.840\n I don't know the proper terminology.\n\n09:22.840 --> 09:24.160\n Tokyo 2020 is what they call it.\n\n09:24.160 --> 09:26.240\n Tokyo 2020, all right.\n\n09:26.240 --> 09:30.120\n So he lost to Tamerlan Bashev.\n\n09:31.200 --> 09:34.360\n I mean, it's always sad to see a sort of greatness\n\n09:34.360 --> 09:35.200\n come to an end.\n\n09:35.200 --> 09:39.080\n It's like Karelin in wrestling and Greco Roman.\n\n09:39.080 --> 09:42.120\n Did you shed a bit of a tear to see greatness go?\n\n09:42.120 --> 09:46.480\n Or is it just the way of life?\n\n09:46.480 --> 09:50.560\n I mean, what did you think about sort of this dominance,\n\n09:50.560 --> 09:53.820\n this run of dominance being stopped?\n\n09:53.820 --> 09:56.640\n I think, I mean, it's obviously sad to see LFC\n\n09:56.640 --> 09:59.400\n and champions succeed, especially people\n\n09:59.400 --> 10:00.480\n that are good people.\n\n10:00.480 --> 10:02.440\n And I think Teddy's a good person.\n\n10:02.440 --> 10:04.320\n I mean, I think there's some arrogant champions\n\n10:04.320 --> 10:06.120\n that everybody would like to see lose\n\n10:06.120 --> 10:10.000\n just because they don't wanna deal with their personality.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:14.000\n But I think Teddy's a very humble champion.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:15.520\n He's a people's champion.\n\n10:15.520 --> 10:17.880\n You know, I think he's been privileged\n\n10:17.880 --> 10:19.800\n and he makes good money from the sport of judo\n\n10:19.800 --> 10:21.880\n and the French Federation has taken care of him well.\n\n10:21.880 --> 10:25.360\n So he's a lifelong judo icon.\n\n10:25.360 --> 10:27.680\n So it's sad to see somebody like that get beat,\n\n10:27.680 --> 10:30.760\n especially when this could have been his third Olympic title\n\n10:30.760 --> 10:35.760\n and just put him in infamy.\n\n10:36.680 --> 10:39.740\n So it was sad to see, but I think, you know,\n\n10:39.740 --> 10:42.080\n every athlete goes through it, right?\n\n10:42.080 --> 10:45.840\n I mean, it's just, that's what the Olympics is all about.\n\n10:45.840 --> 10:48.600\n The great ones fall sometimes and.\n\n10:48.600 --> 10:53.040\n Especially in judo, it's like so, like the margin of error.\n\n10:53.040 --> 10:56.360\n I mean, I guess the other question I wanna ask here is,\n\n10:56.360 --> 11:01.360\n in your sense, how difficult it is to not lose for so long?\n\n11:02.360 --> 11:06.880\n It seems like in judo, like a little mistake and it's over.\n\n11:06.880 --> 11:10.480\n There's no coming back and Ippon means it's over.\n\n11:10.480 --> 11:13.000\n So how difficult is that?\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.180\n It's hard to stay that dominant without question.\n\n11:15.180 --> 11:18.040\n First of all, when you are the entire world\n\n11:18.040 --> 11:20.280\n is training against you just to beat you.\n\n11:20.280 --> 11:22.920\n They're studying every single movement.\n\n11:22.920 --> 11:24.360\n They're studying patterns.\n\n11:24.360 --> 11:25.680\n They're trying to break it down\n\n11:25.680 --> 11:27.680\n and find a flaw in your game.\n\n11:27.680 --> 11:29.400\n So everybody's hunting for you\n\n11:29.400 --> 11:30.400\n when you're the best in the world,\n\n11:30.400 --> 11:31.240\n especially at the Olympics.\n\n11:31.240 --> 11:32.980\n That's the one to beat you at.\n\n11:32.980 --> 11:35.000\n So everybody's focused on you.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.420\n And then there's an incredible amount of pressure\n\n11:37.420 --> 11:38.760\n on that athlete to perform.\n\n11:38.760 --> 11:41.040\n You carry the flag for your country\n\n11:41.040 --> 11:43.320\n when you're at opening ceremonies sometimes.\n\n11:43.320 --> 11:45.900\n There's all spotlight is on you.\n\n11:46.760 --> 11:50.320\n And it's particularly hard when things don't go well early.\n\n11:50.320 --> 11:53.200\n In other words, when you're expected to win\n\n11:53.200 --> 11:55.640\n and then all of a sudden now you're in a hard fight\n\n11:55.640 --> 11:57.200\n and it's not going the way you want,\n\n11:57.200 --> 11:59.160\n that pressure, the one who's the favorite\n\n11:59.160 --> 12:01.000\n feels the pressure the most at the Olympics.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.880\n And that's why I think the other ones are able to win it.\n\n12:03.880 --> 12:05.640\n I've actually never gotten a chance\n\n12:05.640 --> 12:10.640\n to listen to Teddy Renner sort of explain ideas\n\n12:10.720 --> 12:11.920\n behind his Judo.\n\n12:11.920 --> 12:13.760\n Like I wonder what his mental game is like\n\n12:13.760 --> 12:16.800\n because I think his English is pretty, not very good.\n\n12:16.800 --> 12:19.800\n And so, and I just haven't seen good interviews,\n\n12:19.800 --> 12:21.520\n but it's always fascinating to,\n\n12:22.560 --> 12:25.440\n there's certain great athletes\n\n12:25.440 --> 12:28.600\n that are also great thinkers and speakers,\n\n12:28.600 --> 12:32.160\n like the Satya brothers in wrestling.\n\n12:32.160 --> 12:34.640\n Again, not meaning, that's on my to do list,\n\n12:34.640 --> 12:38.200\n 100%, I'm going to Dagestan and talking to them\n\n12:38.200 --> 12:39.640\n because they're brilliant.\n\n12:39.640 --> 12:43.760\n But to be able to sort of, maybe after retirement,\n\n12:43.760 --> 12:46.580\n to think back, what were the systems involved?\n\n12:46.580 --> 12:50.860\n Both on the technical, the training side,\n\n12:50.860 --> 12:53.520\n and then the mental side.\n\n12:53.520 --> 12:56.600\n Because to stay that dominant, just like you're saying,\n\n12:56.600 --> 12:58.520\n everybody's studying to beat you.\n\n13:00.440 --> 13:03.200\n And the heavyweights are just these powerful dudes.\n\n13:03.200 --> 13:06.280\n So to be able to control them with your game\n\n13:06.280 --> 13:09.600\n and the game that everybody knows is coming is,\n\n13:09.600 --> 13:11.720\n I don't know, I don't know what's behind that,\n\n13:11.720 --> 13:15.480\n but there's got to be, it feels like the mental game\n\n13:15.480 --> 13:17.860\n is exceptionally important.\n\n13:17.860 --> 13:19.520\n I think a lot of people underestimate\n\n13:19.520 --> 13:22.160\n just how important that side is.\n\n13:22.160 --> 13:24.160\n Being mentally prepared for victory,\n\n13:24.160 --> 13:27.120\n mentally prepared to be the best, to stay the best.\n\n13:29.040 --> 13:30.400\n There's no way that's weak minded\n\n13:30.400 --> 13:33.480\n that they can accomplish that.\n\n13:33.480 --> 13:36.560\n It's 100% confidence and belief in yourself.\n\n13:36.560 --> 13:38.660\n If we take a big picture view then,\n\n13:38.660 --> 13:39.960\n not necessarily Taylor Renner,\n\n13:39.960 --> 13:42.600\n but if you want to go from the very beginning,\n\n13:42.600 --> 13:47.600\n from day one of judo class to Olympic champion\n\n13:47.740 --> 13:52.080\n or Olympic medalist, what does it take\n\n13:52.080 --> 13:56.000\n to become an Olympic medalist in judo from start to finish?\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.360\n Like how many different trajectories do you see?\n\n13:58.360 --> 14:01.720\n Or is there some unifying principles?\n\n14:01.720 --> 14:03.160\n I think a lot of it has to,\n\n14:03.160 --> 14:07.000\n your journey is gonna depend a lot by where you're from.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.120\n So a path that an American might take\n\n14:09.120 --> 14:10.960\n versus somebody who's from Japan\n\n14:10.960 --> 14:12.800\n or somebody who's from Europe.\n\n14:12.800 --> 14:16.680\n There's two very, three very distinct paths, right?\n\n14:16.680 --> 14:20.000\n Because in Japan, it's part of the culture.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.280\n There's a system of excellence.\n\n14:22.280 --> 14:25.960\n There's elementary school judo, there's junior high school,\n\n14:25.960 --> 14:27.640\n there's high school, there's collegiate,\n\n14:27.640 --> 14:32.640\n there's Olympic and much like our wrestling is here\n\n14:32.640 --> 14:34.480\n in the United States, right?\n\n14:34.480 --> 14:36.500\n It's very similar, there's youth wrestling,\n\n14:36.500 --> 14:39.000\n there's high school, there's NCAA\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:40.220\n and then there's Olympic wrestling.\n\n14:40.220 --> 14:44.000\n And when your country is a factory\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:47.120\n of producing athletes at the highest level,\n\n14:47.120 --> 14:50.460\n then all of those top athletes typically go back\n\n14:50.460 --> 14:52.560\n into the sport and there's professions for them.\n\n14:52.560 --> 14:53.880\n They have an opportunity to coach\n\n14:53.880 --> 14:55.480\n at all those different levels.\n\n14:55.480 --> 14:58.280\n And just the level of their game and the expertise\n\n14:58.280 --> 15:01.620\n that all of them have, even down at the elementary level,\n\n15:01.620 --> 15:04.200\n make their skill so solid.\n\n15:04.200 --> 15:06.000\n And as a coach, in that situation,\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:09.640\n you can just sit back and watch who stands out\n\n15:09.640 --> 15:12.200\n as opposed to, I think in America, I guess,\n\n15:12.200 --> 15:15.240\n you would need to craft.\n\n15:15.240 --> 15:17.420\n You don't get to choose from a thousand people,\n\n15:17.420 --> 15:21.180\n a few people that naturally stand out at the age of nine.\n\n15:21.180 --> 15:25.860\n You have to actually, whatever the natural resources\n\n15:25.860 --> 15:29.800\n you're given, craft them into a champion.\n\n15:30.960 --> 15:34.200\n So if we look at that, the American way,\n\n15:34.200 --> 15:36.280\n where you just have a person with a smile\n\n15:36.280 --> 15:41.120\n show up to your dojo, says I want to be an Olympic medalist,\n\n15:41.120 --> 15:43.040\n what process do you take them through?\n\n15:43.040 --> 15:45.360\n The odds are really insurmountable.\n\n15:45.360 --> 15:47.400\n It's a very, very high hill to climb.\n\n15:47.400 --> 15:50.040\n And there's only a few, there's only a few people\n\n15:50.040 --> 15:52.680\n and there's only a few coaches in this entire country\n\n15:52.680 --> 15:55.120\n that really understand that process\n\n15:55.120 --> 15:58.280\n and that can help people reach that level,\n\n15:58.280 --> 16:00.080\n as it's been proven, right?\n\n16:00.080 --> 16:01.240\n Yeah.\n\n16:01.240 --> 16:05.100\n Number one, you certainly have to have a solid base,\n\n16:05.100 --> 16:08.240\n a fundamental base of an expectation\n\n16:08.240 --> 16:10.120\n of what the training is gonna be.\n\n16:10.120 --> 16:12.680\n And it has to be a level of professionalism\n\n16:12.680 --> 16:14.440\n very, very early, where you're teaching\n\n16:14.440 --> 16:16.880\n all the basic judo moves, all the basic fundamental\n\n16:16.880 --> 16:20.560\n movements, posture, gripping.\n\n16:20.560 --> 16:23.160\n Well, maybe gripping doesn't come in so early in the game,\n\n16:23.160 --> 16:26.640\n but throwing methodology, movements,\n\n16:26.640 --> 16:30.880\n niwaza position, standing fundamental throws.\n\n16:30.880 --> 16:33.960\n And I think most importantly is really the work ethic,\n\n16:33.960 --> 16:35.800\n just the way you're gonna train,\n\n16:35.800 --> 16:37.360\n the intensity you're gonna train with,\n\n16:37.360 --> 16:42.360\n the ability to, mindset of going to tournaments constantly.\n\n16:42.440 --> 16:44.360\n In order to compete with the rest of the world,\n\n16:44.360 --> 16:49.360\n our young kids need to be tested a lot when they're young.\n\n16:49.560 --> 16:51.400\n They have to be put through adversity\n\n16:51.400 --> 16:53.240\n because they don't get put through adversity in training\n\n16:53.240 --> 16:55.000\n because you don't have that many good training partners.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.760\n So you get put through adversity in competition\n\n16:57.760 --> 16:59.520\n and then we see what your weaknesses are\n\n16:59.520 --> 17:02.580\n and we continue to make improvements on those.\n\n17:02.580 --> 17:05.000\n But the journey is, it's long.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:08.080\n And until they're kind of at the teenage years,\n\n17:08.080 --> 17:10.160\n they're gonna have to pretty much stay domestic, right?\n\n17:10.160 --> 17:12.560\n Cause they gotta go through life as a normal kid,\n\n17:12.560 --> 17:15.320\n but they've gotta be training in the dojo at least,\n\n17:15.320 --> 17:17.040\n five days a week.\n\n17:17.040 --> 17:20.360\n Sometimes they might wanna get an extra technical workout in\n\n17:20.360 --> 17:23.160\n or doing some base conditioning in addition to that.\n\n17:23.160 --> 17:24.720\n And then really at the teenage years,\n\n17:24.720 --> 17:28.760\n that's where we really, we've struggled in America\n\n17:28.760 --> 17:31.900\n of keeping teens in the sport of Judo\n\n17:31.900 --> 17:34.520\n as well as developing them properly.\n\n17:34.520 --> 17:36.280\n Cause up until around the teenage years,\n\n17:36.280 --> 17:39.300\n I think the Americans are on par with the rest of the world\n\n17:39.300 --> 17:41.800\n in terms of technique and in terms of skill\n\n17:41.800 --> 17:45.880\n and we've proven we can compete with the rest of the world\n\n17:45.880 --> 17:46.720\n up until that age.\n\n17:46.720 --> 17:50.780\n But that's where Japan and that's where the Europeans\n\n17:50.780 --> 17:52.920\n and the countries that are strong in Judo,\n\n17:52.920 --> 17:55.420\n that's where they put a lot of time, energy and effort\n\n17:55.420 --> 17:59.160\n is it to the teens where they have a great coaching staff,\n\n17:59.160 --> 18:02.000\n they have good training camps with 800,\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.720\n a thousand people going to them every single weekend.\n\n18:05.760 --> 18:07.280\n When you say teens, what do you mean?\n\n18:07.280 --> 18:09.040\n Do you mean literally like 13?\n\n18:09.040 --> 18:12.480\n Yeah, age 13 to 17, 13 to 19.\n\n18:12.480 --> 18:15.680\n And that's where you really accelerate your development.\n\n18:15.680 --> 18:19.160\n So you're saying like in America, when you're young,\n\n18:19.160 --> 18:24.160\n like before nine, 10, 11, 12, you stick in Judo,\n\n18:24.320 --> 18:26.120\n you can progress quite a bit.\n\n18:26.120 --> 18:28.920\n But then I guess the other competition there,\n\n18:28.920 --> 18:33.920\n if you're into two people doing stuff to each other\n\n18:33.920 --> 18:38.920\n in a combative way, the other competitor\n\n18:39.960 --> 18:41.640\n in America is wrestling.\n\n18:41.640 --> 18:45.560\n So Judo almost primes you, like it teaches you\n\n18:45.560 --> 18:47.560\n how to be a great wrestler as well.\n\n18:47.560 --> 18:50.760\n And so then you have to have a hard decision\n\n18:51.640 --> 18:54.720\n because you can probably be a collegiate wrestler.\n\n18:54.720 --> 18:59.720\n You have like a clear plan of where you're going to go\n\n19:00.040 --> 19:01.000\n if you wanna be a wrestler.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:06.000\n With Judo, that plan is less clear.\n\n19:07.280 --> 19:10.360\n So you have to be on your own a bit with your coach,\n\n19:10.360 --> 19:11.200\n that kind of thing.\n\n19:11.200 --> 19:12.120\n Exactly.\n\n19:12.120 --> 19:14.440\n Okay, so when you're on your own with your coach,\n\n19:14.440 --> 19:16.160\n to me, that's just a fascinating journey\n\n19:16.160 --> 19:19.200\n because then it's just like the purity of it.\n\n19:19.200 --> 19:21.700\n It's the coach and the athlete and the dream.\n\n19:22.560 --> 19:25.680\n It's all about the dedication, the five, six,\n\n19:25.680 --> 19:30.680\n seven days a week competing, what, once a month, twice a month.\n\n19:33.320 --> 19:36.880\n Okay, but also, you probably don't have that conversation.\n\n19:36.880 --> 19:37.720\n I don't know if you do.\n\n19:37.720 --> 19:40.360\n Maybe you do, saying like, we're gonna do this\n\n19:40.360 --> 19:41.760\n for the next eight years.\n\n19:41.760 --> 19:44.840\n Right.\n\n19:44.840 --> 19:45.680\n Do you ever sit down?\n\n19:45.680 --> 19:47.960\n Would you just take it the David Goggins way,\n\n19:47.960 --> 19:50.720\n which is like, let's just take it one step at a time.\n\n19:52.720 --> 19:54.040\n Let's hope we're there in eight years.\n\n19:54.040 --> 19:55.160\n Yeah, let's hope we're there.\n\n19:55.160 --> 19:56.360\n Do you actually?\n\n19:56.360 --> 19:58.160\n Like right now, you have to think about,\n\n19:58.160 --> 20:02.040\n the Olympics is gonna be in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\n20:02.040 --> 20:03.720\n So it's really interesting.\n\n20:03.720 --> 20:06.600\n Now would be the time, and now is the time,\n\n20:06.600 --> 20:11.500\n to identify talent and get commitment out of students\n\n20:11.500 --> 20:14.900\n that in seven years, you can make a US Olympic team\n\n20:14.900 --> 20:17.280\n because we're gonna have a full team.\n\n20:17.280 --> 20:20.160\n America's gonna have 14 athletes compete in those games,\n\n20:20.160 --> 20:21.640\n one in every weight class.\n\n20:21.640 --> 20:23.720\n So now's the time, if you're gonna go on a journey\n\n20:23.720 --> 20:25.960\n to the Olympics and stay with the sport of judo,\n\n20:25.960 --> 20:28.440\n now would be the time to do it, you know?\n\n20:28.440 --> 20:33.240\n And so what, you show up to the Pedro Judo Center\n\n20:33.240 --> 20:38.240\n and how much drilling, how much technique,\n\n20:38.240 --> 20:41.320\n strategy discussions, how much randori,\n\n20:41.320 --> 20:44.080\n or like live sparring, how much conditioning\n\n20:44.080 --> 20:48.080\n and strength training, how much of all that?\n\n20:49.200 --> 20:51.240\n How much of cross training to other gyms\n\n20:51.240 --> 20:53.680\n or something like that, traveling abroad?\n\n20:53.680 --> 20:56.860\n Is there something to be said about some aspects\n\n20:56.860 --> 20:57.700\n of that system?\n\n20:57.700 --> 20:58.640\n For sure.\n\n20:58.640 --> 20:59.740\n You need it all.\n\n20:59.740 --> 21:01.080\n What you just said, you need it all of it.\n\n21:01.080 --> 21:02.180\n And we do do all of that.\n\n21:02.180 --> 21:05.040\n Right now, we have a young group of kids at the Academy,\n\n21:05.040 --> 21:05.920\n you'll see tonight.\n\n21:05.920 --> 21:09.320\n Some of them are 14, 13, 15, 17.\n\n21:09.320 --> 21:10.160\n Are they good?\n\n21:10.160 --> 21:10.980\n Yeah, really good.\n\n21:10.980 --> 21:12.560\n Okay, can't wait.\n\n21:12.560 --> 21:14.400\n They're right around your waist, so it'll be perfect.\n\n21:14.400 --> 21:15.240\n That's nice.\n\n21:15.240 --> 21:17.740\n They're just young boys,\n\n21:17.740 --> 21:20.520\n but they've been training hard through COVID.\n\n21:20.520 --> 21:23.800\n We've been, Travis and myself have been training them.\n\n21:23.800 --> 21:26.220\n We share responsibilities.\n\n21:26.220 --> 21:28.920\n They're doing randori like five nights a week.\n\n21:28.920 --> 21:33.000\n We have them doing randori Tuesdays, Wednesdays,\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.520\n Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays\n\n21:35.520 --> 21:36.520\n is when they're doing randori.\n\n21:36.520 --> 21:37.840\n They're coming to the dojo Friday night\n\n21:37.840 --> 21:39.440\n and Sunday night to do training.\n\n21:40.460 --> 21:42.600\n We also have technical sessions for them.\n\n21:42.600 --> 21:44.660\n They're in school now, so it's a little bit challenging,\n\n21:44.660 --> 21:46.520\n but they come five o clock in the afternoon\n\n21:46.520 --> 21:48.220\n and they do a technical session.\n\n21:48.220 --> 21:50.320\n Through COVID, they were coming every morning\n\n21:50.320 --> 21:51.720\n doing technical sessions.\n\n21:51.720 --> 21:53.160\n What's a technical session?\n\n21:53.160 --> 21:56.220\n It's an hour of repetitive throwing\n\n21:56.220 --> 21:59.240\n or repetitive drilling to reinforce movements\n\n21:59.240 --> 22:03.080\n that we deem important to our successful system.\n\n22:03.080 --> 22:06.060\n So, niwaza positions, groundwork positions,\n\n22:06.060 --> 22:08.200\n where we want them to be put in this position\n\n22:08.200 --> 22:10.400\n and they're gonna drill it 50 times\n\n22:10.400 --> 22:12.960\n with resistance in big groups,\n\n22:12.960 --> 22:15.080\n doing drills over and over again,\n\n22:15.080 --> 22:17.320\n picking apart the details of the technique\n\n22:17.320 --> 22:18.360\n and what they're doing wrong,\n\n22:18.360 --> 22:19.920\n showing them how to fix it.\n\n22:19.920 --> 22:21.320\n But now, we've done it so much\n\n22:21.320 --> 22:23.640\n that now we can do a whole drill session with them\n\n22:23.640 --> 22:25.600\n where they know all the different techniques\n\n22:25.600 --> 22:27.200\n inside and out and they can move\n\n22:27.200 --> 22:29.000\n from position to position really quickly.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:31.760\n Do they do it for a period of time,\n\n22:31.760 --> 22:33.920\n like two minutes, five minutes,\n\n22:33.920 --> 22:37.060\n or is it like one, two, they're actually counting?\n\n22:37.060 --> 22:38.720\n No, sometimes it's both.\n\n22:38.720 --> 22:40.240\n So sometimes we do it for reps,\n\n22:40.240 --> 22:42.400\n sometimes we do it for time.\n\n22:42.400 --> 22:44.920\n So sometimes it might be as many as they can do\n\n22:44.920 --> 22:48.000\n in 60 seconds or as many as they can do in two minutes.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:49.320\n And sometimes it might just be,\n\n22:49.320 --> 22:51.880\n I want you to do every position five times.\n\n22:51.880 --> 22:53.680\n In terms of throws,\n\n22:53.680 --> 22:55.640\n we're not talking about it on a crash pad, right?\n\n22:55.640 --> 22:56.480\n It's just.\n\n22:56.480 --> 22:58.680\n We're talking about free moving around the mat.\n\n22:58.680 --> 23:01.500\n And just dynamically and just throwing.\n\n23:01.500 --> 23:02.340\n Correct.\n\n23:02.340 --> 23:06.860\n How many, because as I was mentioning to you offline,\n\n23:06.860 --> 23:08.280\n Travis threw me a few times,\n\n23:09.200 --> 23:11.760\n a lot of times when he was visiting in Austin,\n\n23:11.760 --> 23:14.040\n and I just remembered,\n\n23:14.040 --> 23:15.920\n so there's two things.\n\n23:15.920 --> 23:18.420\n Fortunately or unfortunately in my life,\n\n23:18.420 --> 23:22.360\n having gotten a chance to train with folks of that level,\n\n23:22.360 --> 23:25.120\n with just cleanness of throw and the power,\n\n23:25.120 --> 23:26.600\n and it was very nice.\n\n23:26.600 --> 23:30.040\n I immediately actually enjoyed being thrown like that.\n\n23:31.240 --> 23:33.140\n To throw a little shade at Craig Jones\n\n23:33.140 --> 23:34.840\n with his current mat situation,\n\n23:36.080 --> 23:38.420\n is they're very, they were quite thin.\n\n23:39.460 --> 23:41.160\n And as Travis commented on,\n\n23:41.160 --> 23:42.780\n and not just the thinness of the mats,\n\n23:42.780 --> 23:45.540\n but they were laid on like concrete, right?\n\n23:45.540 --> 23:49.240\n So I felt, it's like soft until it's not.\n\n23:50.680 --> 23:53.800\n But being thrown very cleanly,\n\n23:53.800 --> 23:55.040\n I just felt like there's,\n\n23:55.040 --> 23:57.080\n this is not gonna lead to injury, it was great.\n\n23:57.080 --> 23:59.040\n It wasn't injury prone.\n\n23:59.040 --> 24:00.880\n But then as I mentioned to you,\n\n24:00.880 --> 24:02.940\n when a day or two after,\n\n24:02.940 --> 24:06.600\n my entire leg, one of them, I guess it's the left leg,\n\n24:08.020 --> 24:11.320\n was just black, a bruise.\n\n24:11.320 --> 24:12.680\n It didn't hurt too bad,\n\n24:12.680 --> 24:14.480\n but it was just, the body's gotten soft.\n\n24:14.480 --> 24:17.080\n So I guess the question I have is,\n\n24:17.080 --> 24:21.480\n does the body get used to just that number of throws?\n\n24:21.480 --> 24:26.300\n Just over time, being thrown thousands of times a month?\n\n24:26.300 --> 24:27.300\n Unquestionably.\n\n24:27.300 --> 24:28.760\n Your body gets used to it.\n\n24:28.760 --> 24:30.880\n So it hardens, it gets really hard.\n\n24:30.880 --> 24:33.920\n Which is why judo is hard to come back to\n\n24:33.920 --> 24:35.760\n after you've taken a long period of time off,\n\n24:35.760 --> 24:38.420\n because your body is not used to that impact anymore.\n\n24:39.300 --> 24:42.200\n I always found out that when I was training judo a lot,\n\n24:42.200 --> 24:46.120\n it's hard to shed weight and keep weight off,\n\n24:46.120 --> 24:50.680\n because your body, it develops this layer of protection\n\n24:50.680 --> 24:53.040\n on itself that it doesn't wanna give up.\n\n24:53.040 --> 24:54.120\n When you're sucking a lot of weight,\n\n24:54.120 --> 24:55.560\n that means you're frail.\n\n24:55.560 --> 24:59.160\n So I always seem to retain weight more\n\n24:59.160 --> 25:00.560\n when you're doing hard judo training,\n\n25:00.560 --> 25:02.920\n as opposed to losing weight.\n\n25:02.920 --> 25:05.320\n It's easy when you go out for runs and things like that\n\n25:05.320 --> 25:06.580\n to shed the water weight,\n\n25:06.580 --> 25:09.480\n but to actually keep the pounds off was pretty hard.\n\n25:09.480 --> 25:12.800\n Yeah, the body develops, like you said, a level of protection.\n\n25:12.800 --> 25:14.520\n What about the randori?\n\n25:14.520 --> 25:15.800\n Just out of curiosity, again,\n\n25:15.800 --> 25:18.920\n I haven't ever had the opportunity to train\n\n25:18.920 --> 25:20.400\n with folks at a high level.\n\n25:22.440 --> 25:26.600\n In jiu jitsu, there's different gyms at different styles,\n\n25:26.600 --> 25:29.180\n but I've noticed that at the highest levels,\n\n25:29.180 --> 25:33.200\n people can go pretty hard in a certain kind of way\n\n25:33.200 --> 25:35.480\n where it's more technical,\n\n25:35.480 --> 25:39.560\n and you're moving at 100%,\n\n25:39.560 --> 25:43.600\n but the power is not at 100%.\n\n25:43.600 --> 25:45.680\n It's a weird little dance.\n\n25:46.560 --> 25:51.080\n You're not really forcing stuff.\n\n25:51.080 --> 25:53.880\n You're more focused on the right timing,\n\n25:53.880 --> 25:58.140\n the right positioning of hands and feet and body\n\n25:58.140 --> 25:59.140\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n25:59.140 --> 26:02.560\n You're not forcing stuff in the way you would in competition,\n\n26:02.560 --> 26:04.160\n like really the power.\n\n26:04.160 --> 26:05.560\n Does that sound similar to you\n\n26:05.560 --> 26:07.240\n for the way you try to do randori?\n\n26:07.240 --> 26:08.920\n So there's different styles of judo,\n\n26:08.920 --> 26:10.760\n and I'd say the Japanese style,\n\n26:10.760 --> 26:12.160\n the technical style of judo\n\n26:12.160 --> 26:14.120\n is exactly what you just talked about.\n\n26:14.120 --> 26:16.360\n It's almost like two guys in pajamas, right?\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.720\n We're using minimal effort, maximum efficiency.\n\n26:20.720 --> 26:21.640\n We're moving around,\n\n26:21.640 --> 26:23.680\n and we're trying to feel that movement,\n\n26:23.680 --> 26:25.940\n and it's timing and finesse and technique\n\n26:25.940 --> 26:28.060\n and fun and clean throws.\n\n26:28.060 --> 26:30.840\n And when you train in Japan,\n\n26:30.840 --> 26:34.840\n you can train 15 rounds of randori, five minute rounds.\n\n26:34.840 --> 26:38.640\n That's 75 minutes of straight sparring.\n\n26:38.640 --> 26:41.480\n You can do that straight in Japan without a problem.\n\n26:41.480 --> 26:42.840\n I mean, you'll get tired, of course.\n\n26:42.840 --> 26:45.760\n You're gonna fall a lot, you're gonna throw a lot,\n\n26:45.760 --> 26:48.120\n but it's very free feeling,\n\n26:48.120 --> 26:50.360\n and it's technical as you explained.\n\n26:50.360 --> 26:51.880\n But then when you go to Europe\n\n26:51.880 --> 26:53.900\n and you try to do rounds with the Europeans,\n\n26:53.900 --> 26:55.200\n they are very physical.\n\n26:55.200 --> 26:58.960\n They don't have that same finesse in their training\n\n26:58.960 --> 27:00.340\n that they do in Japan.\n\n27:00.340 --> 27:02.200\n In Europe, you'd be hard pressed\n\n27:02.200 --> 27:04.320\n to do eight rounds of randori in a night.\n\n27:04.320 --> 27:06.400\n It's so physically exhausting\n\n27:06.400 --> 27:09.480\n because so much effort is going into just fighting\n\n27:09.480 --> 27:11.500\n and fending off the gripping system\n\n27:11.500 --> 27:13.560\n and the power of your opponent.\n\n27:13.560 --> 27:16.280\n You're physically drained after eight rounds of randori.\n\n27:16.280 --> 27:18.340\n So it's a much different feel.\n\n27:18.340 --> 27:19.680\n When you say Europe,\n\n27:19.680 --> 27:22.960\n do you mean Germany, France, Britain, Russia?\n\n27:22.960 --> 27:23.800\n Is there a lot?\n\n27:23.800 --> 27:27.040\n So there's a kind of similarity\n\n27:27.040 --> 27:28.840\n to all of those kinds of approaches.\n\n27:28.840 --> 27:30.080\n The only difference would be Russia\n\n27:30.080 --> 27:32.840\n that they do a lot more active drilling,\n\n27:32.840 --> 27:35.440\n a lot more sequential movement training.\n\n27:35.440 --> 27:37.960\n They don't focus as much on randori.\n\n27:37.960 --> 27:42.480\n You'll do much fewer rounds in Russia during training camps\n\n27:42.480 --> 27:44.120\n than you would in those other countries\n\n27:44.120 --> 27:46.780\n we just talked about, France, Germany, et cetera.\n\n27:46.780 --> 27:48.920\n What about in this kind of American system\n\n27:48.920 --> 27:53.480\n where you have much less talent to work with?\n\n27:55.320 --> 27:58.960\n Do you just select whatever works\n\n27:58.960 --> 28:00.080\n for the particular athletes,\n\n28:00.080 --> 28:03.600\n or do you have something you prefer in your system?\n\n28:03.600 --> 28:05.520\n So you need a combination of all of it.\n\n28:05.520 --> 28:06.960\n If you're gonna win at the Olympic level,\n\n28:06.960 --> 28:10.320\n you have to be able to deal with the finesse of the Japanese,\n\n28:10.320 --> 28:12.340\n the physicality of the Europeans.\n\n28:12.340 --> 28:14.560\n You have to focus on the ground,\n\n28:14.560 --> 28:17.240\n niwaza aspect, because a lot of people are weak there\n\n28:17.240 --> 28:18.760\n in the world of the sport of judo.\n\n28:18.760 --> 28:20.400\n That's a chance to win.\n\n28:20.400 --> 28:22.880\n We've sort of developed our American system of judo,\n\n28:22.880 --> 28:24.840\n at least for the last,\n\n28:24.840 --> 28:26.360\n I'd say probably the last 20 years\n\n28:26.360 --> 28:27.960\n it'd be the American system of judo,\n\n28:27.960 --> 28:31.640\n which relies heavily on taking the individual\n\n28:31.640 --> 28:34.080\n and whatever techniques they do,\n\n28:34.080 --> 28:37.800\n perfecting those techniques and the combinations\n\n28:37.800 --> 28:40.080\n and other throws that go with those throws,\n\n28:40.080 --> 28:43.240\n but then implementing and overlaying an American system\n\n28:43.240 --> 28:47.700\n of gripping, niwaza, conditioning, mentality,\n\n28:47.700 --> 28:51.600\n training methodology, and game planning\n\n28:51.600 --> 28:52.640\n to beat your opponents.\n\n28:52.640 --> 28:55.660\n And I think that's the secret sauce to success\n\n28:55.660 --> 28:58.400\n for your Americans, because there's no way,\n\n28:58.400 --> 29:00.960\n if we don't have eight partners to train with in a night\n\n29:00.960 --> 29:02.720\n that are gonna give us good rounds, right?\n\n29:02.720 --> 29:05.320\n We might have two, so we're gonna have the same guy\n\n29:05.320 --> 29:07.920\n four times, those two people four, two times each.\n\n29:07.920 --> 29:09.100\n Now I have four good rounds.\n\n29:09.100 --> 29:11.520\n The rest of the rounds, I'm not being pushed to the limit.\n\n29:11.520 --> 29:12.860\n So we train differently.\n\n29:14.200 --> 29:17.160\n And a lot of times we do a lot of stuff like shark bait.\n\n29:17.160 --> 29:19.240\n When our athletes are preparing for competition,\n\n29:19.240 --> 29:21.000\n for example, when Kayla or Travis\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.620\n were preparing for competition,\n\n29:23.620 --> 29:26.360\n we might only have 20 people in the whole gym\n\n29:26.360 --> 29:29.280\n to work out with, those two Olympic medalists, right?\n\n29:29.280 --> 29:30.840\n And of those 20 people,\n\n29:30.840 --> 29:33.880\n maybe four of them are Travis's size.\n\n29:33.880 --> 29:36.280\n Maybe there's only one girl in the room for Kayla,\n\n29:36.280 --> 29:37.480\n she's gotta train with guys.\n\n29:37.480 --> 29:38.860\n And then the other ones are teenagers\n\n29:38.860 --> 29:41.320\n that are too weak to train with either one of them.\n\n29:41.320 --> 29:43.080\n So what we would do is just put together\n\n29:43.080 --> 29:46.680\n four or five people that could give them a challenge\n\n29:46.680 --> 29:48.480\n and we'd line them up and they would do a minute,\n\n29:48.480 --> 29:49.720\n a minute, a minute, a minute,\n\n29:49.720 --> 29:52.560\n and they'd do five minutes in a row as hard as they can.\n\n29:52.560 --> 29:55.480\n That person can go hard for a minute with Travis or Kayla.\n\n29:55.480 --> 29:56.800\n They can't go five minutes hard,\n\n29:56.800 --> 29:58.240\n but they can go one minute hard.\n\n29:58.240 --> 30:01.720\n So it made their training much, much more intense,\n\n30:01.720 --> 30:03.320\n much more physically demanding.\n\n30:03.320 --> 30:06.160\n And then rinse and repeat that six times\n\n30:06.160 --> 30:08.240\n or eight times in a night,\n\n30:08.240 --> 30:10.680\n they just got 40 minutes of intense randori.\n\n30:10.680 --> 30:13.280\n The person that was training with them that wasn't as good\n\n30:13.280 --> 30:14.600\n only had to do six or eight minutes\n\n30:14.600 --> 30:16.700\n of training the whole night, you know, so.\n\n30:16.700 --> 30:21.640\n It's so, it's so difficult because then you look\n\n30:21.640 --> 30:24.120\n at like the Russian national team\n\n30:25.180 --> 30:30.040\n and you have just the world champions and so,\n\n30:33.600 --> 30:36.600\n or you even have like, what is it,\n\n30:36.600 --> 30:39.700\n Tom Brands and Terry Brands in the wrestling system.\n\n30:39.700 --> 30:43.100\n You have like these people, it's a small group of people,\n\n30:43.100 --> 30:45.760\n but they're all some of the best people in the world\n\n30:45.760 --> 30:47.360\n and they're going head to head.\n\n30:47.360 --> 30:50.000\n And yeah, you don't necessarily get a good look\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:55.000\n kind of a variety of styles, but just the quality is there.\n\n30:55.120 --> 30:58.640\n And even that is missing for people your size in America,\n\n30:58.640 --> 31:02.360\n because that is so difficult to work with,\n\n31:02.360 --> 31:05.520\n which it makes Kayla's and makes Travis's story\n\n31:05.520 --> 31:06.860\n that much more amazing.\n\n31:08.120 --> 31:11.600\n You mentioned kind of picking whatever the set of techniques\n\n31:11.600 --> 31:15.880\n the athlete is naturally good at or prefers or whatever.\n\n31:16.840 --> 31:19.700\n How much specialization is there?\n\n31:19.700 --> 31:21.600\n Maybe if I give you like two choices,\n\n31:21.600 --> 31:24.200\n is it good to have like one throw\n\n31:25.080 --> 31:27.000\n and try to become the best person in the world\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:30.000\n at that throw, or do you want to have a bunch of stuff?\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:32.960\n Like a variety of throws?\n\n31:32.960 --> 31:34.720\n Well, for Travis, it was Ippon Seinagi,\n\n31:34.720 --> 31:36.440\n that was his main throw, right?\n\n31:36.440 --> 31:39.200\n But from that Ippon Seinagi, he had a variety\n\n31:39.200 --> 31:41.440\n of other attacks he could do, you know,\n\n31:41.440 --> 31:44.320\n that mixed it up so that you kept people guessing.\n\n31:44.320 --> 31:46.200\n Maybe it wasn't the Ippon Seinagi that was coming,\n\n31:46.200 --> 31:48.420\n maybe it was the Koshi Gruma that he did,\n\n31:48.420 --> 31:50.240\n or maybe it was the Ippon to Osoto\n\n31:50.240 --> 31:51.400\n that he did in combination.\n\n31:51.400 --> 31:55.080\n So you typically have one main throw that you do.\n\n31:55.080 --> 31:56.840\n For me, it was Tai Otoshi.\n\n31:56.840 --> 31:58.840\n For Kayla, it was her Ogoshi.\n\n31:58.840 --> 32:01.200\n For Travis, it was his Ippon Seinagi.\n\n32:01.200 --> 32:04.120\n But then you come up with a variety of other throws\n\n32:04.120 --> 32:06.380\n that you do from the very same grip.\n\n32:06.380 --> 32:08.360\n So whatever grip you take for your main throw,\n\n32:08.360 --> 32:11.600\n you wanna develop, you know, an arsenal of attacks\n\n32:11.600 --> 32:15.080\n that go in all different directions holding that same grip.\n\n32:15.080 --> 32:18.280\n So you keep your opponent guessing as to what's coming.\n\n32:18.280 --> 32:20.920\n You know, because if they're just sitting on one technique\n\n32:20.920 --> 32:22.320\n at the highest level of sport,\n\n32:22.320 --> 32:23.800\n with the exception of a few, right?\n\n32:23.800 --> 32:26.160\n We talked about Ono's Uchi Mata.\n\n32:26.160 --> 32:27.460\n With the exception of a few,\n\n32:27.460 --> 32:29.480\n most of the world catches on pretty quick\n\n32:29.480 --> 32:30.840\n on how to beat you.\n\n32:30.840 --> 32:33.040\n There is something to just sticking,\n\n32:33.040 --> 32:36.240\n making sure you really dedicate to the main thing.\n\n32:36.240 --> 32:39.680\n So for Travis, that would be like the main version\n\n32:39.680 --> 32:41.400\n of his Seinagi.\n\n32:41.400 --> 32:43.920\n Like really making sure you don't forget\n\n32:43.920 --> 32:46.200\n to really put in the time on that.\n\n32:46.200 --> 32:51.200\n Because I mean, one way to say it is\n\n32:51.920 --> 32:55.940\n that threat being dangerous opens up a lot of things.\n\n32:55.940 --> 32:57.160\n Right.\n\n32:57.160 --> 32:59.260\n But also, I don't know.\n\n33:00.760 --> 33:02.560\n I think I'm just, as a fan,\n\n33:02.560 --> 33:06.760\n I think it's sad when like elite level athletes\n\n33:06.760 --> 33:09.300\n in all like combat sports,\n\n33:09.300 --> 33:12.520\n kind of start taking their main thing for granted.\n\n33:12.520 --> 33:16.540\n Like they think, okay, I've figured that part out.\n\n33:16.540 --> 33:18.680\n Now I'll be working on all this whole system\n\n33:18.680 --> 33:20.800\n on variations, on different setups,\n\n33:20.800 --> 33:24.880\n on lefty versus, some like weird variation\n\n33:24.880 --> 33:27.160\n as opposed to, you know what?\n\n33:27.160 --> 33:29.360\n If you look at some of the best people ever,\n\n33:29.360 --> 33:32.840\n they seem to have not cared about variations at all.\n\n33:32.840 --> 33:34.880\n They're just like literally,\n\n33:34.880 --> 33:37.740\n they are more like Jiro James of Sushi\n\n33:37.740 --> 33:42.480\n and like fine tuning their ear,\n\n33:42.480 --> 33:45.600\n their ability to detect the minute movements\n\n33:45.600 --> 33:48.160\n that give you an opening on that main thing.\n\n33:48.160 --> 33:52.680\n And so the whole time you're just waiting for that throw,\n\n33:52.680 --> 33:55.880\n you're like dancing with the like little bit of pressure\n\n33:55.880 --> 33:58.600\n and like releasing the pressure, putting the pressure,\n\n33:58.600 --> 34:00.600\n maybe a little bit of off balance\n\n34:00.600 --> 34:03.900\n and finding like the right moment to strike\n\n34:03.900 --> 34:05.400\n and focusing on that.\n\n34:05.400 --> 34:08.160\n Again, maybe that's just like a romanticization\n\n34:08.160 --> 34:10.940\n of like the simplicity of that.\n\n34:10.940 --> 34:13.940\n Maybe it is kind of impossible to do that on a large scale,\n\n34:13.940 --> 34:18.940\n but I just, yeah, I don't know if you can comment on that,\n\n34:19.960 --> 34:22.260\n whether there is some value in still putting in\n\n34:22.260 --> 34:25.440\n like tens of thousands of reps on the main, main thing.\n\n34:25.440 --> 34:27.840\n Well, unquestionably that has to happen.\n\n34:27.840 --> 34:30.080\n You still have to drill your main throw\n\n34:30.080 --> 34:31.360\n and you have to fine tune it\n\n34:31.360 --> 34:34.320\n and continue to do repetition after repetition\n\n34:34.320 --> 34:37.120\n and throws on the crash pad or throws on the mat,\n\n34:37.120 --> 34:39.160\n moving around, just explosive movements\n\n34:39.160 --> 34:40.160\n doing your main technique.\n\n34:40.160 --> 34:41.320\n You're never gonna forget that\n\n34:41.320 --> 34:43.080\n and you're not gonna put it to the side\n\n34:43.080 --> 34:44.160\n and not practice it anymore.\n\n34:44.160 --> 34:46.160\n It still has to be part of your repertoire\n\n34:46.160 --> 34:49.720\n and part of your daily training, but you do have to evolve.\n\n34:49.720 --> 34:54.320\n And I think that's the sport of judo, makes you evolve.\n\n34:54.320 --> 34:56.900\n When I look at, we talk about Koga from before, right?\n\n34:56.900 --> 34:59.760\n And we talked about, he had a dynamic Ippon Seinagi\n\n34:59.760 --> 35:01.920\n that nobody could stop for years and years and years.\n\n35:01.920 --> 35:05.080\n But when people started to be unorthodox\n\n35:05.080 --> 35:07.520\n and come down his back and cross grip him\n\n35:07.520 --> 35:09.520\n and he couldn't get to the lapel,\n\n35:09.520 --> 35:10.920\n he had to come up with something else.\n\n35:10.920 --> 35:14.160\n And all of a sudden you saw Koga doing, now he did a Sode\n\n35:14.160 --> 35:15.720\n or now he did a Tomoe Nagi,\n\n35:15.720 --> 35:18.480\n which so he can, he added to his arsenal\n\n35:18.480 --> 35:20.460\n to keep people thinking, keep people guessing.\n\n35:20.460 --> 35:22.760\n So it's not, you're not just that one trick pony.\n\n35:22.760 --> 35:25.220\n They still couldn't stop his Ippon Seinagi\n\n35:25.220 --> 35:26.800\n once he got that grip.\n\n35:26.800 --> 35:28.680\n But if they stopped them from getting that grip\n\n35:28.680 --> 35:30.240\n or putting two hands on the gi,\n\n35:30.240 --> 35:31.700\n he had to go to something else.\n\n35:31.700 --> 35:32.960\n And that's what he did.\n\n35:32.960 --> 35:36.700\n Does Travis's or Koga's Seinagi make sense to you?\n\n35:36.700 --> 35:38.840\n That weird, so when I,\n\n35:38.840 --> 35:41.240\n Because split hip, split hip.\n\n35:41.240 --> 35:43.720\n So I don't know if you know this,\n\n35:43.720 --> 35:45.660\n but like I got into judo because of Travis.\n\n35:45.660 --> 35:47.960\n I watched him at 2008 Olympics and I was,\n\n35:47.960 --> 35:51.960\n there's something about like, just not the cockiness,\n\n35:51.960 --> 35:55.460\n but the confidence and just the refusal to quit,\n\n35:55.460 --> 35:57.640\n the refusal to just, that energy,\n\n35:57.640 --> 35:59.240\n whatever it connected with me is like,\n\n35:59.240 --> 36:01.120\n oh, that guy's bad ass.\n\n36:01.120 --> 36:03.160\n I want to be bad ass like that.\n\n36:03.160 --> 36:06.120\n And then I also there happened to be in my university judo\n\n36:06.120 --> 36:10.120\n and I got into it and just fell in love with the elegance\n\n36:10.120 --> 36:12.120\n and the beauty and the power of the sport.\n\n36:13.560 --> 36:18.560\n But also I started to mimic Travis's game, his and Koga's.\n\n36:18.920 --> 36:21.880\n And then the instructors I worked with,\n\n36:21.880 --> 36:24.360\n they said that's the wrong way to do it.\n\n36:24.360 --> 36:28.400\n And I always, I never found somebody that told me like,\n\n36:28.400 --> 36:29.680\n no, that's not the wrong way.\n\n36:29.680 --> 36:31.100\n There's a lot of ways to do it.\n\n36:31.100 --> 36:32.760\n And there's like the classic way\n\n36:32.760 --> 36:34.400\n and you have to understand it and you have to learn it,\n\n36:34.400 --> 36:36.040\n but this is not the wrong way.\n\n36:36.040 --> 36:37.540\n Cause I was trying to find somebody\n\n36:37.540 --> 36:39.060\n who understands this throw.\n\n36:39.960 --> 36:42.400\n Cause it was so beautiful at the highest level,\n\n36:42.400 --> 36:44.960\n especially with Koga, the way you're able,\n\n36:44.960 --> 36:46.960\n the quickness with which you can strike,\n\n36:46.960 --> 36:48.680\n the fact that you can stand on the feet\n\n36:48.680 --> 36:52.560\n and the elevation you can get and the power you can get\n\n36:52.560 --> 36:57.120\n has certain throws, just like Uchimata\n\n36:57.120 --> 36:58.960\n doesn't look powerful.\n\n36:58.960 --> 37:02.400\n It's just like, it looks effortless.\n\n37:02.400 --> 37:06.760\n But like the standing Seinagi with a split hip,\n\n37:06.760 --> 37:10.240\n it just looks powerful because there's a,\n\n37:10.240 --> 37:12.600\n you're like, you're stepping into them,\n\n37:12.600 --> 37:14.760\n you're lifting the opponent and they still have,\n\n37:14.760 --> 37:17.200\n they're not surprised, they're now like helpless.\n\n37:17.200 --> 37:19.840\n Right, their feet are fluttering in the air.\n\n37:19.840 --> 37:22.000\n And then there's just this pause\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:23.880\n and then just big slam.\n\n37:23.880 --> 37:25.360\n With the Uchimata, it's almost like\n\n37:25.360 --> 37:26.760\n you don't know what hit you.\n\n37:27.600 --> 37:29.000\n It's like Taitoshi is the same.\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:30.040\n It's almost like a surprise.\n\n37:30.040 --> 37:32.160\n Like, oh shit, I'm now on my back.\n\n37:32.160 --> 37:37.160\n And so I just love that throw,\n\n37:37.200 --> 37:40.400\n but like it didn't make sense to me.\n\n37:40.400 --> 37:42.880\n Like when trying to explain it to others,\n\n37:42.880 --> 37:45.360\n when trying to learn, it didn't make sense to me\n\n37:45.360 --> 37:46.200\n how it works.\n\n37:46.200 --> 37:47.440\n Does it make sense to you?\n\n37:47.440 --> 37:48.280\n It does.\n\n37:48.280 --> 37:50.120\n I was born a Judoka, right?\n\n37:50.120 --> 37:54.480\n So I've lived this stuff since I was an infant\n\n37:54.480 --> 37:57.280\n and I've seen every style and every technique.\n\n37:58.160 --> 38:00.960\n The split hip Saiyan Aiki is difficult to learn.\n\n38:00.960 --> 38:03.920\n It's harder to learn than the basic form,\n\n38:03.920 --> 38:08.040\n but it is powerful and it does, upon entry,\n\n38:08.040 --> 38:09.200\n both of your opponent's feet\n\n38:09.200 --> 38:10.440\n leave the mat at the same time.\n\n38:10.440 --> 38:11.280\n So you've got them.\n\n38:11.280 --> 38:12.640\n Once you enter, you've got them.\n\n38:12.640 --> 38:13.800\n You just gotta finish, right?\n\n38:13.800 --> 38:15.360\n You just gotta lock them and turn and go.\n\n38:15.360 --> 38:17.160\n So it makes sense to me.\n\n38:17.160 --> 38:20.000\n My dad did teach me how to do that when I was younger.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:21.400\n Yeah, he wanted me to do a split hip.\n\n38:21.400 --> 38:23.320\n We have kids at the school today\n\n38:23.320 --> 38:26.040\n that we teach the split hip Saiyan Aiki, same way,\n\n38:27.120 --> 38:28.520\n because it is that dynamic, right?\n\n38:28.520 --> 38:31.360\n You don't drop to the ground and roll and turn.\n\n38:31.360 --> 38:32.920\n It's not the classic form\n\n38:32.920 --> 38:34.240\n where you're giving way to your opponent.\n\n38:34.240 --> 38:36.600\n It's actually, you go pick the guy up in the air\n\n38:36.600 --> 38:37.920\n and then you slam him, so.\n\n38:39.080 --> 38:41.840\n Okay, beautiful.\n\n38:41.840 --> 38:43.960\n So maybe on a small tangent,\n\n38:43.960 --> 38:46.360\n so we're talking about elite level athletes\n\n38:46.360 --> 38:49.960\n in terms of Randori, in terms of like drilling.\n\n38:49.960 --> 38:53.040\n For more recreational athletes,\n\n38:53.040 --> 38:56.440\n like, you know, I have personally that situation going on,\n\n38:56.440 --> 38:57.440\n but there's other people\n\n38:57.440 --> 39:00.120\n that are just recreationally training Judo.\n\n39:00.120 --> 39:03.240\n How do you recommend they improve Judo?\n\n39:03.240 --> 39:06.480\n Like if I wanted to compete a bunch\n\n39:06.480 --> 39:10.160\n and do reasonable with a particular set of throws,\n\n39:10.160 --> 39:13.640\n say the split Saiyan Aiki,\n\n39:13.640 --> 39:16.360\n so how do you do the Randori?\n\n39:16.360 --> 39:18.640\n Do you use a crash pad to get in reps?\n\n39:18.640 --> 39:20.320\n Do you, like, what do you recommend?\n\n39:20.320 --> 39:22.920\n So I guess there's two recreational people\n\n39:22.920 --> 39:23.760\n that we're talking about.\n\n39:23.760 --> 39:25.880\n One is somebody who wants to learn Judo\n\n39:25.880 --> 39:27.440\n and become good at Judo,\n\n39:27.440 --> 39:29.680\n but doesn't necessarily want to compete,\n\n39:29.680 --> 39:30.680\n but just wants to get better.\n\n39:30.680 --> 39:33.480\n And I think that there's not enough emphasis\n\n39:33.480 --> 39:36.800\n in this country on paying attention\n\n39:36.800 --> 39:37.960\n to that type of student.\n\n39:37.960 --> 39:40.120\n Everybody pushes them to competition.\n\n39:40.120 --> 39:43.400\n But in reality, there's a huge audience of people out there\n\n39:43.400 --> 39:44.880\n that would love to learn Judo\n\n39:44.880 --> 39:46.800\n and be very proficient at Judo\n\n39:46.800 --> 39:50.120\n and have the skills to go execute if they ever needed it.\n\n39:50.120 --> 39:51.520\n And there's a class\n\n39:51.520 --> 39:53.800\n and there should be a program for that athlete.\n\n39:53.800 --> 39:56.600\n And that athlete does not need to do Randori.\n\n39:56.600 --> 39:59.120\n Like the sport of Judo is physical enough\n\n39:59.120 --> 40:01.000\n where you're picking somebody up all the time\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.760\n and moving their body weight around the mat all the time,\n\n40:03.760 --> 40:05.840\n where you can get very physically strong,\n\n40:05.840 --> 40:07.400\n very physically fit.\n\n40:07.400 --> 40:09.280\n Technically, you'll be better than somebody\n\n40:09.280 --> 40:11.960\n that does Randori more than you\n\n40:11.960 --> 40:14.360\n because if you learn good technique\n\n40:14.360 --> 40:16.440\n and you learn the movement and you learn the feel\n\n40:16.440 --> 40:18.720\n and you learn the timing,\n\n40:18.720 --> 40:20.240\n you'll actually be a better athlete\n\n40:20.240 --> 40:22.240\n than the person that just focuses on Randori\n\n40:22.240 --> 40:24.760\n who does ugly technique and wins with force.\n\n40:24.760 --> 40:28.680\n So we have a recreational class at our school\n\n40:28.680 --> 40:30.200\n where they don't do any Randori.\n\n40:30.200 --> 40:31.640\n They have an option afterwards\n\n40:31.640 --> 40:33.160\n if they want to stay for 15 minutes\n\n40:33.160 --> 40:34.120\n or stay for 30 minutes\n\n40:34.120 --> 40:36.200\n where they can participate in Randori.\n\n40:36.200 --> 40:39.120\n But most of the adult students choose not to\n\n40:39.120 --> 40:42.160\n because they're already so tired from the other hour class.\n\n40:42.160 --> 40:43.080\n It's a good workout.\n\n40:43.080 --> 40:44.520\n Right, they're already dripping sweat.\n\n40:44.520 --> 40:48.520\n They're already like, if you work hard and drill hard,\n\n40:48.520 --> 40:51.400\n it's an intense workout, you're exhausted.\n\n40:51.400 --> 40:55.800\n So that's a specific set of program,\n\n40:55.800 --> 40:57.160\n I should say, at every academy.\n\n40:57.160 --> 41:01.680\n And then if you want to get good and you want to compete,\n\n41:01.680 --> 41:04.520\n then to me, once you have your techniques,\n\n41:04.520 --> 41:09.320\n it's learning how to implement a good gripping system\n\n41:09.320 --> 41:11.320\n to put yourself in a position\n\n41:11.320 --> 41:14.640\n where you can always dominate the grips,\n\n41:16.560 --> 41:19.440\n control the movement, initiate the reactions\n\n41:19.440 --> 41:20.280\n from your opponent,\n\n41:20.280 --> 41:22.560\n and then have the opportunity to attack and score.\n\n41:22.560 --> 41:25.440\n And I think that when people train with,\n\n41:25.440 --> 41:29.080\n or when they jump into a higher level of the sport of judo,\n\n41:29.080 --> 41:32.360\n all of a sudden the first thing they say is, I can't attack.\n\n41:32.360 --> 41:33.400\n I don't know how to attack.\n\n41:33.400 --> 41:35.440\n Because positionally, they don't know\n\n41:35.440 --> 41:36.440\n where to put their hands.\n\n41:36.440 --> 41:38.800\n They don't know how to hold the gi properly.\n\n41:38.800 --> 41:41.200\n They don't understand that they're,\n\n41:41.200 --> 41:43.040\n they have an inferior grip,\n\n41:43.040 --> 41:45.520\n and they don't know how to get into better positions\n\n41:45.520 --> 41:46.360\n so they can't attack.\n\n41:46.360 --> 41:47.600\n And that's a big part of the game\n\n41:47.600 --> 41:49.760\n that not a lot of people really understand.\n\n41:49.760 --> 41:52.720\n So you really, even for recreational competitors,\n\n41:52.720 --> 41:54.880\n you really need to have a gripping system.\n\n41:54.880 --> 41:57.200\n You need to understand the gripping system.\n\n41:57.200 --> 41:58.880\n If you want to win.\n\n41:58.880 --> 42:00.680\n I mean, if the goal is to go and compete,\n\n42:00.680 --> 42:01.520\n that's a different story.\n\n42:01.520 --> 42:03.600\n You're going, I don't have fun getting beat up\n\n42:03.600 --> 42:04.800\n or losing in competitions.\n\n42:04.800 --> 42:06.960\n I enjoy the...\n\n42:06.960 --> 42:09.120\n I don't even know if it's the winning or the losing.\n\n42:09.120 --> 42:12.080\n I don't think, I think this is what,\n\n42:12.080 --> 42:14.320\n because I competed a lot in both Judo and Jiu Jitsu,\n\n42:14.320 --> 42:18.120\n and in Judo, it feels like,\n\n42:18.120 --> 42:19.960\n because I didn't have a gripping system,\n\n42:19.960 --> 42:21.880\n it feels like you're not even playing Judo\n\n42:21.880 --> 42:24.440\n against the good black belts.\n\n42:24.440 --> 42:26.360\n You're, they're just, they're not,\n\n42:26.360 --> 42:28.160\n they're not even trying because they have,\n\n42:28.160 --> 42:29.840\n they get a certain kind of grip,\n\n42:29.840 --> 42:31.360\n and you just can't do anything.\n\n42:31.360 --> 42:33.120\n And I don't have a good answer for that.\n\n42:33.120 --> 42:34.800\n I don't even know what I'm looking for.\n\n42:34.800 --> 42:36.160\n And so it's not even fun.\n\n42:36.160 --> 42:37.800\n It's not like even losing.\n\n42:37.800 --> 42:40.680\n It's like, I don't know.\n\n42:40.680 --> 42:43.480\n It's like you didn't even show up to play\n\n42:43.480 --> 42:44.640\n is what it feels like.\n\n42:44.640 --> 42:47.960\n And it's not, and I think that is a big gap\n\n42:47.960 --> 42:52.880\n in knowledge, actually, in Judo schools,\n\n42:52.880 --> 42:55.720\n is the gripping part.\n\n42:55.720 --> 42:59.040\n When you first go out to do Judo, right?\n\n42:59.040 --> 43:00.320\n You, the first thing you have to do\n\n43:00.320 --> 43:01.880\n is you have to grab your opponent, right?\n\n43:01.880 --> 43:04.040\n And a lot of times I hear coaches say, get a grip.\n\n43:04.040 --> 43:04.880\n Just take a grip.\n\n43:04.880 --> 43:07.280\n Well, sometimes if you take a grip,\n\n43:07.280 --> 43:10.440\n you're in a worse position than not having a grip at all.\n\n43:10.440 --> 43:11.960\n And that's what a lot of people don't understand.\n\n43:11.960 --> 43:14.360\n Like if you hold the gi in the wrong way,\n\n43:14.360 --> 43:16.920\n your opponent can attack you, but you can't attack him.\n\n43:16.920 --> 43:19.280\n So why would you ever do that grip\n\n43:20.400 --> 43:22.840\n if it's only to your detriment, right?\n\n43:22.840 --> 43:26.880\n So that's, and the way you grip does set up\n\n43:26.880 --> 43:28.360\n what attacks you can do as well.\n\n43:28.360 --> 43:29.680\n So that is a huge part.\n\n43:29.680 --> 43:32.720\n And I'm not saying that you have to be 100% disciplined\n\n43:32.720 --> 43:34.480\n and only always outgrip your opponent\n\n43:34.480 --> 43:36.160\n and only be able to do throws\n\n43:36.160 --> 43:37.200\n when you have a superior grip.\n\n43:37.200 --> 43:40.400\n I'm just saying that to be able to put the grips together\n\n43:40.400 --> 43:42.200\n with the throws and understand the movements\n\n43:42.200 --> 43:45.040\n is gonna make you that much ahead of the game.\n\n43:45.040 --> 43:48.480\n So if we take a step to our previous discussion\n\n43:48.480 --> 43:51.840\n of going from zero to hero.\n\n43:51.840 --> 43:55.840\n So going from the early days through the teenage years\n\n43:55.840 --> 43:58.560\n to winning an Olympic medal.\n\n43:58.560 --> 44:00.920\n So we mentioned a lot of training,\n\n44:00.920 --> 44:03.940\n the dedication of the training, the competing,\n\n44:03.940 --> 44:05.160\n what other elements are there?\n\n44:05.160 --> 44:07.960\n The mental side is visualization,\n\n44:07.960 --> 44:12.680\n believing that you could perform at that level.\n\n44:12.680 --> 44:13.760\n So what else can you say about that?\n\n44:13.760 --> 44:15.280\n I think that comes at the highest level,\n\n44:15.280 --> 44:17.320\n the visualization, the success,\n\n44:17.320 --> 44:18.520\n that comes at the highest level.\n\n44:18.520 --> 44:23.240\n I think in the teen years, there's the experience,\n\n44:23.240 --> 44:27.360\n just plays a huge role in getting to train\n\n44:27.360 --> 44:28.280\n with other people.\n\n44:28.280 --> 44:30.960\n Like as Americans, we have to go train in Europe.\n\n44:30.960 --> 44:33.240\n We have to feel the European style of judo.\n\n44:33.240 --> 44:35.760\n You have to understand that physicality.\n\n44:35.760 --> 44:38.080\n They grip very differently.\n\n44:38.080 --> 44:41.160\n They put you in very unorthodox positions.\n\n44:41.160 --> 44:43.800\n And if you don't know how to deal with that,\n\n44:43.800 --> 44:45.480\n you get thrown before you even have a chance\n\n44:45.480 --> 44:47.240\n to try your own throws.\n\n44:47.240 --> 44:50.520\n So it takes a lot of that experience\n\n44:50.520 --> 44:52.800\n and understanding what's going on.\n\n44:52.800 --> 44:55.160\n And then you also need to get that physicality.\n\n44:55.160 --> 44:59.260\n You need to be strong and hard, I would say,\n\n44:59.260 --> 45:01.680\n by doing all those rounds with the Europeans.\n\n45:01.680 --> 45:03.560\n And at the same time, you need to go to Asia\n\n45:03.560 --> 45:05.280\n and you need to train in Japan\n\n45:05.280 --> 45:08.740\n because you need to feel that free flowing judo\n\n45:08.740 --> 45:10.760\n for your technical side.\n\n45:10.760 --> 45:12.600\n And I think that's one of the things\n\n45:12.600 --> 45:13.880\n that I was able to benefit from.\n\n45:13.880 --> 45:15.040\n My dad was a coach who said,\n\n45:15.040 --> 45:17.840\n ''Listen, I've taken you as far as I can take you.\n\n45:17.840 --> 45:20.200\n ''I want you to go to the next level.''\n\n45:20.200 --> 45:23.040\n And he sent me to England with Neil Adams,\n\n45:23.040 --> 45:25.800\n who was an Olympic silver medalist and was a world champion,\n\n45:25.800 --> 45:28.140\n had a great ground game and was good at gripping\n\n45:28.140 --> 45:30.480\n and actually did Tai Otoshi, which is the throw I did.\n\n45:30.480 --> 45:32.520\n So my dad said, ''I want you to go learn from Neil.''\n\n45:32.520 --> 45:34.800\n And I ended up going to England\n\n45:34.800 --> 45:36.660\n probably eight to 10 times in my career\n\n45:36.660 --> 45:38.280\n and spending a good amount of time there\n\n45:38.280 --> 45:40.700\n training at the Neil Adams Academy.\n\n45:40.700 --> 45:43.040\n He's now the voice of judo, Neil Adams.\n\n45:43.040 --> 45:43.960\n What do you make of that guy?\n\n45:43.960 --> 45:44.920\n Just a brief pause.\n\n45:44.920 --> 45:47.800\n He's like the, like Morgan Freeman\n\n45:47.800 --> 45:50.200\n is the voice of like March of the Penguins\n\n45:50.200 --> 45:52.240\n and any other nature documentary.\n\n45:52.240 --> 45:54.880\n And Neil Adams is, there's very few sports\n\n45:54.880 --> 45:56.400\n that have a Neil Adams, I would say,\n\n45:56.400 --> 46:00.880\n because he's legitimately, maybe like Joe Rogan\n\n46:00.880 --> 46:02.800\n is that from mixed martial arts.\n\n46:02.800 --> 46:06.320\n It's just like an exceptionally recognizable voice.\n\n46:06.320 --> 46:07.960\n He's really knowledgeable.\n\n46:07.960 --> 46:10.520\n Also the passion is conveyed so well.\n\n46:10.520 --> 46:13.560\n Like many times I'll watch just because he's talking.\n\n46:13.560 --> 46:14.580\n So who is he?\n\n46:14.580 --> 46:16.640\n Since you've gotten a chance to train with him,\n\n46:16.640 --> 46:18.760\n to learn from him, who is Neil Adams?\n\n46:18.760 --> 46:20.240\n He's a great friend of mine.\n\n46:20.240 --> 46:21.080\n He is?\n\n46:21.080 --> 46:21.900\n He's a mentor.\n\n46:23.520 --> 46:24.960\n Like I said, I lived and trained\n\n46:24.960 --> 46:27.680\n at the Neil Adams Club in Coventry, England\n\n46:27.680 --> 46:29.880\n since I was like 16 years old.\n\n46:29.880 --> 46:31.880\n I went and visited him for the first time.\n\n46:31.880 --> 46:33.400\n He's the one who originally taught me\n\n46:33.400 --> 46:37.320\n how to do jujigatami and the way that I do jujigatami.\n\n46:37.320 --> 46:38.140\n I trained with him.\n\n46:38.140 --> 46:39.480\n He was just retired.\n\n46:39.480 --> 46:41.800\n He was in his early thirties when I first went out there.\n\n46:41.800 --> 46:43.920\n And so I trained with him many times\n\n46:43.920 --> 46:47.440\n and over the years he was a mentor.\n\n46:48.600 --> 46:51.440\n Great person, cares about people,\n\n46:51.440 --> 46:56.440\n cares about the sport of judo, had a good little club\n\n46:56.520 --> 46:57.800\n that was a fitness club.\n\n46:57.800 --> 47:00.880\n And it was judo, it was fitness.\n\n47:00.880 --> 47:02.960\n It used to go there.\n\n47:02.960 --> 47:05.280\n I'd show up at that place at like seven in the morning.\n\n47:05.280 --> 47:07.260\n And the first thing we would do is we'd go for a run.\n\n47:07.260 --> 47:09.300\n And we'd either be running mountains\n\n47:09.300 --> 47:11.280\n or we'd be doing a five mile run\n\n47:11.280 --> 47:13.120\n or we'd be doing something at the park.\n\n47:13.120 --> 47:15.680\n We were doing sprints and buddy carries and all this stuff.\n\n47:15.680 --> 47:18.200\n And then at 9 a.m. we'd have a technical session\n\n47:18.200 --> 47:21.000\n with Neil Adams where he would, for an hour and a half,\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.300\n we would drill techniques and learn positions.\n\n47:23.300 --> 47:25.000\n And it was no randori.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:26.600\n It was that sequential drilling\n\n47:26.600 --> 47:28.080\n that we talked about before, right?\n\n47:28.080 --> 47:31.840\n Where you're reinforcing your two or three attacks\n\n47:31.840 --> 47:33.000\n to set up your main attack.\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:34.180\n Or if you're on the ground,\n\n47:34.180 --> 47:36.900\n you're going through repetitions of certain movements.\n\n47:38.200 --> 47:41.880\n And then I'd spend all afternoon at the club, have lunch.\n\n47:41.880 --> 47:45.280\n I'd go do my weight training in the afternoon at that place.\n\n47:45.280 --> 47:46.240\n And then in the evening,\n\n47:46.240 --> 47:49.400\n we would either do randori training at the Neil Adams Club\n\n47:49.400 --> 47:50.640\n or we would all get in a car\n\n47:50.640 --> 47:53.760\n and we'd drive to another location\n\n47:53.760 --> 47:55.120\n and we'd go train at another club\n\n47:55.120 --> 47:56.240\n that might be an hour away.\n\n47:56.240 --> 47:58.300\n And there'd be 50 bodies there to train with.\n\n47:58.300 --> 48:00.440\n And each night we'd go to a different dojo.\n\n48:00.440 --> 48:02.360\n And so it would be all day at the club\n\n48:02.360 --> 48:04.680\n and I'd do that for like three weeks straight.\n\n48:04.680 --> 48:05.800\n All we'd do was train.\n\n48:05.800 --> 48:08.120\n Do you know how he became the voice of judo?\n\n48:08.120 --> 48:12.700\n Do you have an understanding of what he's thinking is\n\n48:12.700 --> 48:15.720\n around how much he dedicates to himself\n\n48:15.720 --> 48:17.920\n to just commentating on judo?\n\n48:17.920 --> 48:21.280\n I imagine the amount of research required,\n\n48:21.280 --> 48:23.020\n but also just like psychologically,\n\n48:23.020 --> 48:25.400\n just the excitement he has in his voice.\n\n48:25.400 --> 48:28.020\n It takes work to do that.\n\n48:28.020 --> 48:28.920\n Do you have an understanding\n\n48:28.920 --> 48:30.960\n of like what his vision is with that?\n\n48:30.960 --> 48:35.080\n He's always been a very charismatic, animated person, Neil.\n\n48:35.080 --> 48:38.520\n Very passionate and loud and funny.\n\n48:38.520 --> 48:40.100\n And the Brits are very funny to begin with.\n\n48:40.100 --> 48:42.880\n So he's very charismatic.\n\n48:42.880 --> 48:46.600\n But I think after coaching, he tried coaching.\n\n48:46.600 --> 48:48.960\n He coached the country of Wales for a while.\n\n48:48.960 --> 48:51.120\n He tried coaching stints in other countries.\n\n48:51.120 --> 48:54.800\n He didn't have a lot of success on the coaching side\n\n48:54.800 --> 48:56.320\n developing an Olympic champion.\n\n48:56.320 --> 49:00.200\n I know that was a goal of his that he was a world champion.\n\n49:00.200 --> 49:01.520\n I think it was 1981.\n\n49:01.520 --> 49:05.600\n He won two silver medals in the Olympic games himself.\n\n49:05.600 --> 49:07.920\n He went on to coach for a while\n\n49:07.920 --> 49:09.820\n and had some political issues\n\n49:09.820 --> 49:12.680\n with the country of England for a while.\n\n49:12.680 --> 49:14.440\n And then left England and went to Wales.\n\n49:14.440 --> 49:15.840\n And I think he had a coaching stint\n\n49:15.840 --> 49:17.520\n somewhere else as well.\n\n49:17.520 --> 49:20.400\n Didn't have a lot of success coaching in the sport\n\n49:20.400 --> 49:22.120\n with athletes, not at the highest level.\n\n49:22.120 --> 49:24.280\n Had a great national team and things like that.\n\n49:24.280 --> 49:27.400\n He was really good at teaching his technique to others\n\n49:27.400 --> 49:29.040\n because he helped me a lot.\n\n49:30.640 --> 49:33.280\n But running a program, I think was difficult for him.\n\n49:33.280 --> 49:35.760\n The boys not listening and not having that same kind\n\n49:35.760 --> 49:37.800\n of passion and intensity that he...\n\n49:37.800 --> 49:39.800\n And that's why I bonded well with him\n\n49:39.800 --> 49:41.060\n because I was all in, right?\n\n49:41.060 --> 49:43.160\n I went there and whatever he said, I did.\n\n49:43.160 --> 49:45.640\n I didn't care how hard, I didn't care how long.\n\n49:45.640 --> 49:47.160\n I just wanted to get as good as I could.\n\n49:47.160 --> 49:50.160\n And so that's why he was a good mentor for me.\n\n49:50.160 --> 49:54.680\n But now in terms of a commentator, he's very cerebral.\n\n49:54.680 --> 49:59.340\n He loves judo, he researches it nonstop.\n\n50:00.380 --> 50:02.120\n He's got that great voice\n\n50:02.120 --> 50:05.560\n and he knows how to bring life to the game.\n\n50:05.560 --> 50:06.400\n And that's what he's done.\n\n50:06.400 --> 50:08.000\n And now this is who he is, right?\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:11.040\n He does judo full time, this is his job.\n\n50:11.040 --> 50:15.600\n Can I ask you a small, before we return to the actual sport,\n\n50:15.600 --> 50:17.200\n the coaching and the sport,\n\n50:17.200 --> 50:18.860\n it's a bit of a political question.\n\n50:18.860 --> 50:21.080\n I did a whole rant before Travis episode.\n\n50:23.980 --> 50:26.200\n I love Neil Adams's voice.\n\n50:26.200 --> 50:28.000\n I love watching judo.\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:33.000\n And it's really disappointing to me that the IOC\n\n50:33.240 --> 50:36.660\n and whoever is responsible, I don't understand this,\n\n50:36.660 --> 50:39.440\n that they don't make it easy for people\n\n50:39.440 --> 50:44.080\n to watch the Olympics in replay for years after.\n\n50:44.080 --> 50:46.320\n Like I can't watch Travis's matches.\n\n50:46.320 --> 50:49.000\n I can't watch, like they make it very difficult\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.320\n to watch stuff online.\n\n50:51.320 --> 50:55.880\n So what happened is I uploaded the Travis Stevens episode\n\n50:55.880 --> 50:59.200\n and we talked about his Ole Bischoff 2012 match.\n\n50:59.200 --> 51:04.080\n And it was like one minute of like a small overlay\n\n51:04.080 --> 51:06.760\n of the video as we're talking through it,\n\n51:06.760 --> 51:08.080\n like stepping through it.\n\n51:08.080 --> 51:11.760\n And it got taken down immediately from YouTube,\n\n51:11.760 --> 51:14.300\n the whole four hour conversation\n\n51:14.300 --> 51:16.560\n because of that one minute little clip.\n\n51:17.640 --> 51:20.640\n And the way it got taken down automatically\n\n51:20.640 --> 51:24.960\n is because the IOC has that video uploaded.\n\n51:24.960 --> 51:27.360\n It's set to private, but it's uploaded.\n\n51:27.360 --> 51:31.120\n So like they have the video and they choose not to show it.\n\n51:31.120 --> 51:33.280\n It's not that they're asking for money or whatever.\n\n51:33.280 --> 51:35.340\n They're just not showing it anywhere.\n\n51:35.340 --> 51:37.560\n They're not showing it through their own service.\n\n51:37.560 --> 51:39.720\n Like an NBC Olympics or so on.\n\n51:39.720 --> 51:42.120\n There's just so many great human stories\n\n51:42.120 --> 51:44.120\n that the Olympics reveals.\n\n51:44.120 --> 51:46.760\n They're just not made easily accessible.\n\n51:46.760 --> 51:50.420\n That's the Olympics charter is you want to,\n\n51:50.420 --> 51:54.840\n I think the actual line is to ensure the fullest coverage\n\n51:54.840 --> 51:57.280\n and the widest possible audience in the world\n\n51:57.280 --> 51:58.800\n for the Olympic games.\n\n51:58.800 --> 52:02.440\n And it seems like to me as a fan of the Olympic games,\n\n52:02.440 --> 52:04.160\n we're not getting any of that.\n\n52:04.160 --> 52:08.040\n Do you have an understanding of why that is?\n\n52:08.040 --> 52:10.640\n Like why we can't watch Kayla's matches,\n\n52:10.640 --> 52:12.520\n Travis's matches super easily,\n\n52:12.520 --> 52:14.920\n even if we're willing to pay money for it.\n\n52:14.920 --> 52:17.760\n So you can't go on the International Judo Federation\n\n52:17.760 --> 52:20.520\n website right now and watch any of the Olympic footage?\n\n52:20.520 --> 52:22.680\n No, no, no.\n\n52:23.940 --> 52:26.960\n So the only thing they have is for certain,\n\n52:26.960 --> 52:30.000\n for example, Teddy Rene match he lost.\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:31.120\n Not available anywhere.\n\n52:31.120 --> 52:31.960\n Really?\n\n52:31.960 --> 52:33.580\n And that's like a dramatic thing.\n\n52:33.580 --> 52:36.760\n So the one thing they have is for certain sports\n\n52:36.760 --> 52:39.140\n at the highest level, like gymnastics,\n\n52:39.140 --> 52:40.520\n they'll have a highlight,\n\n52:40.520 --> 52:43.620\n which is the most frustrating thing to me.\n\n52:43.620 --> 52:46.080\n Because this is what I can't,\n\n52:46.080 --> 52:50.100\n I'm going to try to prevent myself from going on a rant.\n\n52:50.100 --> 52:55.100\n But people don't just want to see a two minute highlight\n\n52:56.600 --> 52:58.560\n of a historic moment.\n\n52:58.560 --> 53:01.400\n They want to see the buildup where the athlete is standing,\n\n53:01.400 --> 53:04.120\n the nerves, the fear, the confidence.\n\n53:04.120 --> 53:06.080\n You see the buildup to the event,\n\n53:06.080 --> 53:09.160\n say it's a gymnastic, whatever, floor routine.\n\n53:09.160 --> 53:11.800\n Like their name is announced, they're walking,\n\n53:11.800 --> 53:13.800\n the coat, then they cut to the coach,\n\n53:13.800 --> 53:15.640\n and the coach with anticipation,\n\n53:15.640 --> 53:16.800\n and then go to the athlete.\n\n53:16.800 --> 53:18.720\n You want the full 10 minute thing.\n\n53:18.720 --> 53:20.760\n You don't want a two minute highlight\n\n53:20.760 --> 53:23.360\n of what happened like last second or whatever.\n\n53:23.360 --> 53:28.240\n It's just like the magic of that full story.\n\n53:28.240 --> 53:32.400\n Like a lifetime building up to those 10 minutes, right?\n\n53:32.400 --> 53:34.320\n That's the magic of the Olympics.\n\n53:34.320 --> 53:36.080\n The both the drama and the triumph\n\n53:36.080 --> 53:37.500\n that happens in those moments.\n\n53:37.500 --> 53:39.660\n And the fact that you can't relive that.\n\n53:41.080 --> 53:43.400\n Like Travis had a bunch of those, right?\n\n53:43.400 --> 53:46.920\n Like he had a bunch of times he faced like world champions,\n\n53:46.920 --> 53:49.880\n he won and lost, and just, it's always close,\n\n53:49.880 --> 53:51.760\n it's always dramatic.\n\n53:51.760 --> 53:54.240\n And none of those are available except like\n\n53:54.240 --> 53:59.240\n maybe the one where he beat Armbard,\n\n53:59.600 --> 54:01.880\n or whatever the submission was, I forgot.\n\n54:01.880 --> 54:04.960\n The choke, yeah, the Georgian.\n\n54:04.960 --> 54:07.360\n But most things are not.\n\n54:07.360 --> 54:09.920\n Usain Bolt, the full races,\n\n54:09.920 --> 54:12.220\n not all of his races are available online.\n\n54:13.160 --> 54:18.160\n The race with the Italian winning the 100 meter track race,\n\n54:19.640 --> 54:22.400\n this Olympics is not only highlight is available\n\n54:22.400 --> 54:24.440\n from what I saw, I didn't look too hard.\n\n54:24.440 --> 54:28.240\n So like, but the fact that it's not super easily accessible\n\n54:28.240 --> 54:29.760\n if you're willing to pay money even,\n\n54:29.760 --> 54:33.040\n but probably should be for free, is heartbreaking to me.\n\n54:33.040 --> 54:38.040\n Because to me, the Olympics is like some of the best\n\n54:38.380 --> 54:40.120\n of humanity.\n\n54:40.120 --> 54:43.280\n Just like, again, the hardship they have to overcome.\n\n54:43.280 --> 54:45.480\n So like the losses are really powerful.\n\n54:45.480 --> 54:46.760\n Because it's such heartbreak,\n\n54:46.760 --> 54:49.400\n but it's also like the triumph.\n\n54:49.400 --> 54:50.640\n Where you're losing history.\n\n54:50.640 --> 54:52.480\n You're losing history is what you are,\n\n54:52.480 --> 54:55.760\n of all the magical moments of your sport, right?\n\n54:55.760 --> 54:57.380\n It's a sin.\n\n54:58.600 --> 55:03.600\n I got to blame it on television rights and money.\n\n55:03.940 --> 55:04.780\n That's what it comes down to.\n\n55:04.780 --> 55:06.480\n It's like billions and billions of dollars\n\n55:06.480 --> 55:10.260\n of television rights paid by NBC here in the United States\n\n55:10.260 --> 55:13.020\n and globally, whatever the main carriers are\n\n55:13.020 --> 55:16.080\n and all the other nations that are dictating\n\n55:16.080 --> 55:17.960\n what can be replayed and what can't.\n\n55:17.960 --> 55:20.200\n And that's what it comes down to.\n\n55:20.200 --> 55:25.200\n I made a DVD or a video when I first retired\n\n55:25.720 --> 55:26.560\n from the sport.\n\n55:26.560 --> 55:27.400\n It was called Fury on the Mat.\n\n55:27.400 --> 55:28.780\n It was kind of my story, right?\n\n55:28.780 --> 55:32.440\n And I did it with a friend who was a videographer\n\n55:32.440 --> 55:34.720\n and we grabbed a bunch of my old footage\n\n55:34.720 --> 55:38.060\n and Olympic footage and somebody said to me,\n\n55:38.060 --> 55:39.920\n you can't use that Olympic footage.\n\n55:39.920 --> 55:41.840\n And I was young and I had just retired.\n\n55:41.840 --> 55:43.280\n I said, what do you mean I can't use the Olympic footage?\n\n55:43.280 --> 55:45.360\n It's not the television footage.\n\n55:45.360 --> 55:47.520\n It's my buddy who filmed it with his own camera.\n\n55:47.520 --> 55:48.360\n It's my footage.\n\n55:48.360 --> 55:49.200\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n55:49.200 --> 55:51.240\n And then they said, no, if it has Olympics in it\n\n55:51.240 --> 55:52.960\n or it's anything to do with the Olympics,\n\n55:52.960 --> 55:54.640\n the USOC owns it.\n\n55:54.640 --> 55:55.460\n Yeah.\n\n55:55.460 --> 55:56.300\n I said, okay, well, they said,\n\n55:56.300 --> 55:57.680\n well, you should get to send it to them\n\n55:57.680 --> 56:00.280\n and let them review it.\n\n56:00.280 --> 56:02.640\n So I sent it to them and I got a bill back.\n\n56:02.640 --> 56:03.920\n I got a thing back that said,\n\n56:03.920 --> 56:05.040\n if you want to use this footage,\n\n56:05.040 --> 56:06.880\n it's going to be like $30,000.\n\n56:06.880 --> 56:09.200\n And I said, man, it's only like three minutes.\n\n56:09.200 --> 56:11.120\n I spliced it up as much as I could\n\n56:11.120 --> 56:13.240\n and I only have highlights in there.\n\n56:13.240 --> 56:14.080\n And then I said, come on.\n\n56:14.080 --> 56:17.360\n I went back and I negotiated with them.\n\n56:17.360 --> 56:18.200\n But at the end of the day,\n\n56:18.200 --> 56:20.440\n I still had to pay like $15,000\n\n56:20.440 --> 56:23.720\n just to have a few minutes of footage in my own film.\n\n56:23.720 --> 56:25.320\n This is...\n\n56:25.320 --> 56:27.040\n And I'm thinking, you wouldn't even have that film\n\n56:27.040 --> 56:28.120\n if I didn't compete in it.\n\n56:28.120 --> 56:30.200\n You know, like you can't, you know.\n\n56:30.200 --> 56:31.920\n So it was a struggle.\n\n56:31.920 --> 56:32.760\n This is the different,\n\n56:32.760 --> 56:34.760\n like you have the same in Jiu Jitsu.\n\n56:34.760 --> 56:37.760\n There's certain organizations, IBJJF\n\n56:37.760 --> 56:40.040\n or like Flow Grappling and Flow Wrestling.\n\n56:40.040 --> 56:43.040\n I understand, I think when it's a business,\n\n56:43.040 --> 56:44.620\n it might make sense.\n\n56:44.620 --> 56:46.240\n First of all, you should actually be good\n\n56:46.240 --> 56:48.160\n at being a business and making money,\n\n56:48.160 --> 56:51.080\n which is why for me, the IOC doesn't make sense.\n\n56:51.080 --> 56:54.320\n Like it should be accessible, but it would cost money.\n\n56:56.320 --> 56:57.560\n I can't buy it.\n\n56:57.560 --> 57:00.240\n Like would I have to email them for this footage\n\n57:00.240 --> 57:01.080\n and pay $30,000?\n\n57:01.080 --> 57:02.040\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n57:02.040 --> 57:04.840\n No, but the question is,\n\n57:04.840 --> 57:06.220\n like the way you run a business\n\n57:06.220 --> 57:08.200\n is you make that frictionless.\n\n57:08.200 --> 57:11.040\n Whatever the money is, $30,000 or $30,\n\n57:11.040 --> 57:13.840\n you make it frictionless and easy to pay that money.\n\n57:13.840 --> 57:17.000\n But anyway, I understand why that might be the case\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:18.400\n with Flow Grappling,\n\n57:18.400 --> 57:21.020\n but to me, the Olympics is a special thing.\n\n57:21.020 --> 57:21.860\n For sure.\n\n57:21.860 --> 57:23.880\n It's like, like you said, it is history.\n\n57:23.880 --> 57:25.160\n Like there's not even,\n\n57:25.160 --> 57:27.920\n like even the world championships don't compare.\n\n57:27.920 --> 57:30.180\n I understand they're really important,\n\n57:30.180 --> 57:32.080\n but Olympics is history.\n\n57:32.080 --> 57:37.080\n And the stories should certainly belong to the athletes\n\n57:37.160 --> 57:39.840\n if they want to do like Fury on the Mat\n\n57:39.840 --> 57:41.480\n to do their own story,\n\n57:41.480 --> 57:46.120\n or like on a podcast to talk about the most tragic moment\n\n57:46.120 --> 57:47.260\n of their career.\n\n57:49.660 --> 57:53.060\n Do you have a sense of how that could be fixed or no?\n\n57:54.720 --> 57:56.640\n The only thing I could think of is,\n\n57:56.640 --> 57:58.320\n you'd have to go to the Olympic committee.\n\n57:58.320 --> 58:00.800\n The US Olympic committee is the place I would start\n\n58:00.800 --> 58:02.940\n because the US controls the worldwide market\n\n58:02.940 --> 58:04.600\n when it comes to television.\n\n58:04.600 --> 58:06.280\n We pay the most for our television rights.\n\n58:06.280 --> 58:09.860\n Our sponsors pay the most for their rights\n\n58:09.860 --> 58:12.000\n to be associated with the best team in the world,\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:13.220\n which is the United States, right?\n\n58:13.220 --> 58:15.240\n So all the money starts here.\n\n58:16.180 --> 58:18.900\n I gotta believe there has to be a way to get that footage\n\n58:18.900 --> 58:22.440\n that should be accessible to the sports themselves.\n\n58:22.440 --> 58:23.560\n I'm surprised it's not,\n\n58:23.560 --> 58:27.360\n but if it's not, then it's because of dollars.\n\n58:27.360 --> 58:28.600\n It's because people aren't,\n\n58:28.600 --> 58:31.440\n the sport itself is not willing to pay enough money\n\n58:31.440 --> 58:35.720\n to have it on its, accessible to its audience.\n\n58:35.720 --> 58:38.660\n It's too cost prohibitive for them to do it.\n\n58:38.660 --> 58:40.760\n No, but I think it's also, unfortunately,\n\n58:40.760 --> 58:43.080\n might be some mixture of incompetence\n\n58:43.080 --> 58:45.160\n and just an old way of doing things\n\n58:45.160 --> 58:48.400\n because there's a lot of money to be made\n\n58:48.400 --> 58:52.880\n on television rights where you live show the event, right?\n\n58:52.880 --> 58:56.600\n But what's not being leveraged is the huge amount of money\n\n58:56.600 --> 58:58.040\n that could be made on the replay.\n\n58:58.040 --> 59:00.800\n This is what people don't understand is,\n\n59:00.800 --> 59:05.000\n do you know how many times, just the tens of millions\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:10.000\n of times that people watch individual events years from now?\n\n59:10.360 --> 59:12.640\n You watch like all the videos on YouTube,\n\n59:12.640 --> 59:14.200\n they're still getting plays.\n\n59:14.200 --> 59:16.200\n Hundreds of millions of views on stuff\n\n59:16.200 --> 59:18.620\n that happened 10 years ago, 15 years ago.\n\n59:18.620 --> 59:20.920\n That's really powerful and there's a lot of opportunity\n\n59:20.920 --> 59:22.320\n to make a ton of money.\n\n59:22.320 --> 59:25.500\n So it's not that they're necessarily greedy.\n\n59:25.500 --> 59:28.000\n They're also just not good at being greedy.\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:28.840\n I get what you're saying.\n\n59:28.840 --> 59:30.160\n Yeah, it's not the tradition.\n\n59:30.160 --> 59:32.220\n Think about it though, it's not traditional, right?\n\n59:32.220 --> 59:35.800\n For television studios, it's nontraditional\n\n59:35.800 --> 59:40.280\n to go to online streaming, to online access to information.\n\n59:40.280 --> 59:41.260\n It's not hard, right?\n\n59:41.260 --> 59:45.120\n Because everybody's doing it now, but it's not typical.\n\n59:45.120 --> 59:49.020\n Yeah, so it requires for the IOC\n\n59:49.020 --> 59:51.400\n to operate outside their comfort zone.\n\n59:51.400 --> 59:53.280\n Well, I definitely hope that's the case.\n\n59:53.280 --> 59:58.280\n And since Travis's video got taken down,\n\n59:59.320 --> 1:00:00.440\n it's obvious they have it.\n\n1:00:00.440 --> 1:00:02.520\n They have it on their YouTube channel.\n\n1:00:02.520 --> 1:00:07.520\n So it's like, I hope that they will just release it.\n\n1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:10.600\n And for money, for whatever, but release it\n\n1:00:10.600 --> 1:00:15.600\n and have that history not be erased, right?\n\n1:00:16.320 --> 1:00:19.080\n It'd be wonderful if athletes could buy.\n\n1:00:19.080 --> 1:00:20.340\n Even if you could buy your own footage,\n\n1:00:20.340 --> 1:00:22.060\n you can't use it commercially, you can't,\n\n1:00:22.060 --> 1:00:24.160\n but you can buy your own matches\n\n1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:25.820\n and have them available for yourself\n\n1:00:25.820 --> 1:00:30.820\n or package the footage, it'd be awesome.\n\n1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:32.440\n Thank you for that.\n\n1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:34.240\n That is quite heartbreaking for me,\n\n1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:36.460\n so I wanted to talk about it a little bit.\n\n1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:41.440\n Let's go to you as an athlete real quick.\n\n1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:42.280\n Sure.\n\n1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:45.720\n You represented the United States at four Olympics,\n\n1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:48.040\n winning a bronze medal at two of them.\n\n1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:53.520\n Who or what was the toughest match or moment\n\n1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:55.240\n you had in those years?\n\n1:00:55.240 --> 1:00:58.560\n Maybe a moment that defined you,\n\n1:00:58.560 --> 1:00:59.760\n that you remember as being\n\n1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:03.400\n particularly defining in your career.\n\n1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:11.320\n I would say the bronze medal match in Atlanta in 96,\n\n1:01:11.660 --> 1:01:13.080\n because up to that moment,\n\n1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:15.680\n the United States team had not won a medal,\n\n1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:18.560\n had not fought for a medal in the games.\n\n1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:20.240\n We were on our home turf.\n\n1:01:20.240 --> 1:01:22.240\n It was my second Olympic games, right?\n\n1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:25.040\n So I had competed in 92 and I had won two matches\n\n1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:28.540\n and lost in the third round in Barcelona.\n\n1:01:28.540 --> 1:01:29.680\n I didn't make the podium.\n\n1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:31.700\n I lost to a Japanese guy from Japan.\n\n1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:36.060\n But the gold, silver, and bronze medalist\n\n1:01:36.060 --> 1:01:39.520\n at that Olympics in Barcelona were all guys that I had beat.\n\n1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:41.680\n In fact, two of them I was undefeated against\n\n1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:42.520\n in my entire career,\n\n1:01:42.520 --> 1:01:45.200\n the Brazilian and the Cuban I had never lost to.\n\n1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:48.360\n So that's when I knew I was capable of being\n\n1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:50.440\n on the podium at the Olympic games.\n\n1:01:50.440 --> 1:01:53.680\n When 96 came around, I was 25 years old.\n\n1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:55.240\n I was fairly in my prime.\n\n1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:56.880\n I had lived in Japan for six months.\n\n1:01:56.880 --> 1:01:58.740\n My technique was at a high level.\n\n1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:02.180\n I was amongst the best in the world.\n\n1:02:04.320 --> 1:02:07.880\n I lost at that Olympics to a guy from Mongolia.\n\n1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:09.320\n It was right before the match\n\n1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:10.800\n I was supposed to fight against Japan.\n\n1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:13.360\n So I was anticipating the match against Japan\n\n1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:15.720\n and I got beat by the Mongolian.\n\n1:02:15.720 --> 1:02:16.940\n So that was kind of a letdown.\n\n1:02:16.940 --> 1:02:21.940\n But the match for the bronze in front of the hometown crowd,\n\n1:02:21.940 --> 1:02:24.300\n all of my family, all of my friends,\n\n1:02:24.300 --> 1:02:27.820\n everybody who had ever helped me in the sport\n\n1:02:27.820 --> 1:02:29.340\n were in the stands that day,\n\n1:02:29.340 --> 1:02:31.720\n including all my teammates at Brown University\n\n1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:32.940\n that were on the wrestling team\n\n1:02:32.940 --> 1:02:35.460\n and little, my uncles, my aunts,\n\n1:02:35.460 --> 1:02:37.660\n everybody was in the stands, right?\n\n1:02:37.660 --> 1:02:39.920\n So it was like the Jimmy Pedro day.\n\n1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:42.660\n And I'm getting goosebumps right now talking about it.\n\n1:02:44.060 --> 1:02:46.260\n But it was a match against the Brazilian\n\n1:02:46.260 --> 1:02:47.200\n for the bronze medal.\n\n1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:49.240\n I had beaten the Brazilian like two or three times\n\n1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:50.080\n before that.\n\n1:02:50.080 --> 1:02:54.080\n And I found myself down in the match.\n\n1:02:54.080 --> 1:02:55.360\n He actually countered me.\n\n1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:58.320\n I came in my Taiyo Toshi and he was waiting for it\n\n1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:00.840\n and he counted me and he scored a yuko against me.\n\n1:03:00.840 --> 1:03:02.640\n So I was losing the fight,\n\n1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:05.280\n came down to about the last minute in the match\n\n1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:06.960\n and I was just tucking in my gi\n\n1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:09.920\n and fixing my thing and gathering my thoughts together.\n\n1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:12.580\n And the whole crowd just started chanting,\n\n1:03:12.580 --> 1:03:16.320\n USA, USA, USA.\n\n1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:18.620\n And I like literally like got so much energy.\n\n1:03:18.620 --> 1:03:20.720\n I walked out there, I grabbed the guy,\n\n1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:22.280\n I came in my Taiyo Toshi again.\n\n1:03:22.280 --> 1:03:24.160\n He stepped off the Taiyo Toshi.\n\n1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:26.600\n I threw him with duchimada for Ippon.\n\n1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:29.320\n I won my first Olympic medal\n\n1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:31.700\n in front of the hometown crowd.\n\n1:03:31.700 --> 1:03:33.840\n Everybody went bananas.\n\n1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:36.560\n The United States judo team had our first medal\n\n1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:37.840\n from the Olympics.\n\n1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:39.680\n It ended up being the only Olympic medal\n\n1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:41.080\n we won at that games.\n\n1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:44.440\n But it was like a magical moment that defined my career\n\n1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:46.920\n and solidified myself in like history where,\n\n1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:49.360\n hey, now I get to step up on the Olympic podium\n\n1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:50.760\n and I'm Olympic medalist.\n\n1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:53.660\n And to me, that was my defining moment.\n\n1:03:53.660 --> 1:03:55.840\n And after that, I was sold.\n\n1:03:55.840 --> 1:03:57.860\n Like man, I had to go back to the Olympics again.\n\n1:03:57.860 --> 1:03:58.960\n I wanna win a gold medal.\n\n1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:01.680\n I want this feeling all over again.\n\n1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:05.040\n I don't care if I have to wait four years, let's do it.\n\n1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:08.480\n In your career, like moments like that,\n\n1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:13.480\n do you think you love winning or hate losing more?\n\n1:04:13.480 --> 1:04:17.840\n So do you live for those moments\n\n1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:22.840\n or are you more driven by just how much you hate losing?\n\n1:04:24.340 --> 1:04:26.340\n So in order to be a champion,\n\n1:04:26.340 --> 1:04:29.400\n my belief is that you have to hate losing\n\n1:04:29.400 --> 1:04:31.280\n more than you like winning.\n\n1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:33.600\n Hate losing more than you like winning.\n\n1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:36.840\n But I live for those moments when you do win.\n\n1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:39.080\n And what excited me the most in my career\n\n1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:44.080\n when I was competing was I loved being in the finals.\n\n1:04:44.320 --> 1:04:46.440\n I loved the spotlight being on me.\n\n1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:48.920\n I can't think of too many times in my career,\n\n1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:50.360\n of course there were a few,\n\n1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:54.120\n but there weren't too many times where the chips were down,\n\n1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:56.840\n like the lights were on and I didn't win.\n\n1:04:56.840 --> 1:05:00.000\n Like it was, I might've lost early in the day\n\n1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:01.280\n and didn't make it to the finals\n\n1:05:01.280 --> 1:05:02.860\n or didn't make it to the medal rounds.\n\n1:05:02.860 --> 1:05:06.320\n But like in my career, I have a ton of golds.\n\n1:05:06.320 --> 1:05:07.840\n I have a ton of bronzes,\n\n1:05:07.840 --> 1:05:11.600\n which means the lights are on and I won\n\n1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:15.000\n and I have very few silvers and very few fifths.\n\n1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:16.600\n So I either lost in the early rounds\n\n1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:18.560\n and didn't make it to the medal rounds in my younger days\n\n1:05:18.560 --> 1:05:21.640\n or the spotlight came and I really shined.\n\n1:05:21.640 --> 1:05:23.560\n Cause if you look, I don't know how many silvers,\n\n1:05:23.560 --> 1:05:25.560\n but there wasn't very many silver medals in my career\n\n1:05:25.560 --> 1:05:26.560\n that I won.\n\n1:05:26.560 --> 1:05:27.400\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:05:27.400 --> 1:05:29.000\n So I just loved that moment.\n\n1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:30.240\n I didn't feel pressure.\n\n1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:31.720\n I loved the crowd.\n\n1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:33.400\n I loved being in the spotlight.\n\n1:05:33.400 --> 1:05:36.200\n I didn't have, I wasn't nervous when it came to the finals\n\n1:05:36.200 --> 1:05:37.840\n or I knew I was getting a medal.\n\n1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:38.960\n It didn't matter.\n\n1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:40.760\n You know, so it was just me against the other guy\n\n1:05:40.760 --> 1:05:42.360\n and that's how I always saw it.\n\n1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:44.200\n And I just loved that moment.\n\n1:05:44.200 --> 1:05:45.880\n So your dad was your coach.\n\n1:05:45.880 --> 1:05:46.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:50.120\n You didn't get to meet him tonight.\n\n1:05:50.120 --> 1:05:51.000\n Oh, great.\n\n1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:56.080\n He's kind of a legend in the sport.\n\n1:05:56.080 --> 1:05:59.180\n So how has your dad helped you as a coach,\n\n1:05:59.180 --> 1:06:02.360\n as an athlete, as a human being throughout the years?\n\n1:06:02.360 --> 1:06:06.360\n Number one, my dad is the most brutally honest person\n\n1:06:06.360 --> 1:06:08.360\n you will ever meet in your life.\n\n1:06:08.360 --> 1:06:09.360\n Brutally honest.\n\n1:06:09.360 --> 1:06:12.400\n He will tell you, if you are fat,\n\n1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:14.560\n he will tell you you're fat, right, to your face.\n\n1:06:14.560 --> 1:06:15.400\n He wants you to get better.\n\n1:06:15.400 --> 1:06:16.720\n He wants you to be healthy.\n\n1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:17.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:17.560 --> 1:06:18.640\n Doesn't want you to die of obesity.\n\n1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:20.080\n It's just the way he is.\n\n1:06:20.080 --> 1:06:23.680\n If you didn't do well, he will not sugarcoat it.\n\n1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:26.080\n He will let you know what you didn't do right.\n\n1:06:26.080 --> 1:06:28.000\n So he's the ultimate litmus test.\n\n1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:28.840\n Yes.\n\n1:06:28.840 --> 1:06:29.680\n Right?\n\n1:06:29.680 --> 1:06:34.680\n Second is, he is the most passionate, caring, deep,\n\n1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:41.020\n always thinking about, very cerebral,\n\n1:06:41.020 --> 1:06:44.740\n very like a student of the game,\n\n1:06:44.740 --> 1:06:49.260\n somebody who helped me immensely in defining my strategy,\n\n1:06:49.260 --> 1:06:53.540\n helping me improve, and always look for what's next.\n\n1:06:53.540 --> 1:06:58.100\n Third, in terms of training,\n\n1:06:58.100 --> 1:07:02.180\n I think that he's probably the most brilliant human\n\n1:07:02.180 --> 1:07:06.580\n when it comes to preparing an athlete physically,\n\n1:07:06.580 --> 1:07:10.060\n not necessarily mentally, physically, for success.\n\n1:07:10.060 --> 1:07:11.460\n When all the chips are down,\n\n1:07:11.460 --> 1:07:12.900\n that athlete will be ready that day,\n\n1:07:12.900 --> 1:07:15.860\n and he has a system of training and preparing\n\n1:07:15.860 --> 1:07:18.860\n and getting the athlete to peak for performance.\n\n1:07:18.860 --> 1:07:20.900\n You mean like conditioning, like the whole thing?\n\n1:07:20.900 --> 1:07:21.920\n Yes.\n\n1:07:21.920 --> 1:07:26.920\n Okay, because I vaguely remember Kayla Harrison\n\n1:07:27.860 --> 1:07:31.020\n talking about her preparation being very difficult.\n\n1:07:31.020 --> 1:07:31.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:31.860 --> 1:07:33.320\n That's it.\n\n1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:34.160\n That's him.\n\n1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:35.660\n Yeah, that's him.\n\n1:07:35.660 --> 1:07:38.420\n At the same, you go back and ask Ronda Rousey\n\n1:07:38.420 --> 1:07:39.440\n about her career, right?\n\n1:07:39.440 --> 1:07:41.320\n My dad was her coach.\n\n1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:45.880\n My dad moved her to Camp New Hampshire in Boston,\n\n1:07:45.880 --> 1:07:48.160\n got her up, ran her in the morning,\n\n1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:50.700\n had her downstairs in the basement of his house,\n\n1:07:50.700 --> 1:07:51.680\n training with the weights.\n\n1:07:51.680 --> 1:07:52.960\n We brought a Russian girl in.\n\n1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:54.980\n She did throws on his cement outside\n\n1:07:54.980 --> 1:07:55.820\n with the little crash pad.\n\n1:07:55.820 --> 1:07:56.660\n Nice.\n\n1:07:56.660 --> 1:07:59.300\n Threw the Russian girl a hundred times that morning,\n\n1:07:59.300 --> 1:08:02.020\n and then every night came to Boston,\n\n1:08:02.020 --> 1:08:03.380\n to the training center in Wakefield,\n\n1:08:03.380 --> 1:08:05.660\n trained at night, and went back and slept at my dad's house,\n\n1:08:05.660 --> 1:08:09.300\n and three weeks straight before she went off to Beijing.\n\n1:08:09.300 --> 1:08:11.100\n And he did the same with Kayla.\n\n1:08:11.100 --> 1:08:12.400\n He did the same with me.\n\n1:08:14.500 --> 1:08:17.460\n His passion is producing athletes at the highest level,\n\n1:08:17.460 --> 1:08:18.800\n and he knows how to do it.\n\n1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:22.260\n And then the one side of my dad's\n\n1:08:23.860 --> 1:08:26.220\n coaching where I think there's a flaw or a weakness\n\n1:08:26.220 --> 1:08:28.320\n is on the mental preparation side of the game.\n\n1:08:28.320 --> 1:08:29.880\n He wasn't somebody that was,\n\n1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:32.480\n I don't know if he,\n\n1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:34.940\n maybe because he wasn't an Olympic champion himself\n\n1:08:34.940 --> 1:08:36.240\n and wasn't a world champion,\n\n1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:39.820\n he lacked the confidence in helping others be more confident.\n\n1:08:39.820 --> 1:08:41.680\n So he's more of a,\n\n1:08:41.680 --> 1:08:43.580\n this is what you need to work on type of thing.\n\n1:08:43.580 --> 1:08:46.240\n He doesn't know how to build the athletes up\n\n1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:48.260\n to make them feel invincible.\n\n1:08:48.260 --> 1:08:49.380\n And I feel like that's something\n\n1:08:49.380 --> 1:08:51.300\n that I was able to give all of the athletes,\n\n1:08:51.300 --> 1:08:55.060\n to help them with that visualization, belief in yourself,\n\n1:08:55.060 --> 1:08:56.140\n knowing that you're gonna win\n\n1:08:56.140 --> 1:08:57.260\n before you step out of the mat,\n\n1:08:57.260 --> 1:09:00.020\n knowing that we've earned the right to victory,\n\n1:09:00.020 --> 1:09:02.260\n seeing success in your mind,\n\n1:09:02.260 --> 1:09:05.300\n having a positive mantra that you,\n\n1:09:05.300 --> 1:09:07.380\n I'm the best in the world, nobody's beating me today,\n\n1:09:07.380 --> 1:09:09.080\n type of feeling.\n\n1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:10.980\n So you go out there feeling like King Kong\n\n1:09:10.980 --> 1:09:12.380\n when you step on the mat,\n\n1:09:12.380 --> 1:09:14.420\n that nobody's gonna stop you.\n\n1:09:14.420 --> 1:09:17.960\n And so I think the combination of both of us as coaches,\n\n1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:20.260\n I'm a lot more technical.\n\n1:09:20.260 --> 1:09:21.900\n My dad is good at letting,\n\n1:09:21.900 --> 1:09:24.820\n identifying what they need to do for their techniques\n\n1:09:24.820 --> 1:09:28.420\n and what, in strategy, how to beat opponents\n\n1:09:28.420 --> 1:09:30.780\n and putting game plans together.\n\n1:09:30.780 --> 1:09:33.760\n So combined, the two of us made an unbelievable team.\n\n1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:36.420\n So he's not gonna let the athlete be soft\n\n1:09:36.420 --> 1:09:39.340\n when they enter the highest,\n\n1:09:39.340 --> 1:09:43.580\n the most difficult competitions of their career.\n\n1:09:43.580 --> 1:09:48.100\n So on the mental side, what's mental preparation look like?\n\n1:09:48.100 --> 1:09:50.820\n Like how many years before the Olympics\n\n1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:54.060\n do you start helping an athlete believe\n\n1:09:54.060 --> 1:09:57.460\n that they can win an Olympic medal?\n\n1:09:57.460 --> 1:09:58.980\n Well, I think it's gotta be a seed\n\n1:09:58.980 --> 1:10:02.260\n in that athlete's brain, something they wanna do, right?\n\n1:10:02.260 --> 1:10:05.700\n Nobody can quickly get there, right?\n\n1:10:05.700 --> 1:10:06.740\n It's a long process.\n\n1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:09.220\n But if your goal, if you're national champion\n\n1:10:09.220 --> 1:10:10.940\n or you've proven yourself to win\n\n1:10:10.940 --> 1:10:13.260\n in some international tournaments,\n\n1:10:13.260 --> 1:10:15.420\n and you think the Olympics is a possibility for you,\n\n1:10:15.420 --> 1:10:19.140\n then defining it as, hey, I wanna be on the Olympic team,\n\n1:10:19.140 --> 1:10:24.140\n that would be the first step into getting ready.\n\n1:10:24.180 --> 1:10:28.340\n And I always make them put it on paper.\n\n1:10:28.340 --> 1:10:29.580\n If it really is your goal,\n\n1:10:29.580 --> 1:10:30.880\n then you show me that it's your goal\n\n1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:32.940\n and put it on paper and commit to it.\n\n1:10:32.940 --> 1:10:34.100\n I wanna be Olympic medalist,\n\n1:10:34.100 --> 1:10:35.060\n I wanna be Olympic champion,\n\n1:10:35.060 --> 1:10:36.540\n I wanna go to the Olympics.\n\n1:10:36.540 --> 1:10:38.900\n World team member, maybe junior world team member,\n\n1:10:38.900 --> 1:10:41.700\n whatever it is, we walk before we go to the highest level.\n\n1:10:41.700 --> 1:10:44.340\n But if the goal is to go to the Olympics,\n\n1:10:44.340 --> 1:10:46.860\n let's accomplish these other things first, right?\n\n1:10:46.860 --> 1:10:50.260\n Because if we can accomplish these other things,\n\n1:10:50.260 --> 1:10:52.580\n then we're on our way to getting to the ultimate goal,\n\n1:10:52.580 --> 1:10:54.140\n which is the Olympics.\n\n1:10:54.140 --> 1:10:56.300\n For somebody like Kayla, for example,\n\n1:10:58.500 --> 1:11:02.180\n she didn't say that she wanted to be Olympic champion\n\n1:11:02.180 --> 1:11:05.300\n when she first came here in 2005, right?\n\n1:11:05.300 --> 1:11:07.820\n We wanted to become national champion,\n\n1:11:07.820 --> 1:11:09.260\n then we wanted to be on the world team,\n\n1:11:09.260 --> 1:11:10.980\n then we wanted to be a world medalist.\n\n1:11:10.980 --> 1:11:12.860\n Then our sights were set on the Olympics\n\n1:11:12.860 --> 1:11:14.540\n or the Olympic gold.\n\n1:11:14.540 --> 1:11:17.100\n So it's having those clearly defined goals\n\n1:11:17.100 --> 1:11:18.100\n that are attainable.\n\n1:11:18.100 --> 1:11:20.940\n Like they should be a reach, they should be a stretch,\n\n1:11:20.940 --> 1:11:22.700\n but they have to be attainable.\n\n1:11:22.700 --> 1:11:24.300\n They can't be just a pipe dream.\n\n1:11:25.300 --> 1:11:30.060\n But once you put it to paper and you think it's achievable,\n\n1:11:30.060 --> 1:11:33.020\n then it's mapping the plan to get there.\n\n1:11:33.020 --> 1:11:36.860\n Is there a daily process of visualizing yourself\n\n1:11:36.860 --> 1:11:40.020\n as an Olympic champion or national champion?\n\n1:11:40.020 --> 1:11:43.060\n Yes, it is, and you should do it\n\n1:11:43.060 --> 1:11:45.180\n either every night before you go to bed\n\n1:11:45.180 --> 1:11:48.660\n or before every training session\n\n1:11:48.660 --> 1:11:50.100\n or after every training session.\n\n1:11:50.100 --> 1:11:51.660\n One of those three times it should,\n\n1:11:51.660 --> 1:11:54.020\n or first thing you wake up in the morning,\n\n1:11:54.020 --> 1:11:55.580\n because it may be to help some people,\n\n1:11:55.580 --> 1:11:57.700\n it motivates them to go do what it is\n\n1:11:57.700 --> 1:11:59.340\n they're supposed to do in the day.\n\n1:12:00.820 --> 1:12:04.620\n But the process of visualization is, to me,\n\n1:12:04.620 --> 1:12:07.540\n is closing your eyes for a few moments.\n\n1:12:07.540 --> 1:12:09.820\n Your brain works really, really fast, right?\n\n1:12:09.820 --> 1:12:14.580\n And it's actually picturing the day in its entirety,\n\n1:12:14.580 --> 1:12:16.100\n from start to finish,\n\n1:12:16.100 --> 1:12:19.260\n from the moment you wake up and you step on the scale\n\n1:12:19.260 --> 1:12:20.540\n to the moment you have your breakfast\n\n1:12:20.540 --> 1:12:22.300\n and you go through your morning routine.\n\n1:12:22.300 --> 1:12:24.980\n Like live the day that you're gonna have at the Olympics.\n\n1:12:24.980 --> 1:12:26.180\n So whatever it is you're trying to do,\n\n1:12:26.180 --> 1:12:28.180\n let's say the Olympic day, for example.\n\n1:12:29.300 --> 1:12:31.020\n Picture yourself making weight,\n\n1:12:31.020 --> 1:12:33.900\n picture yourself, who you're around, eating your breakfast,\n\n1:12:33.900 --> 1:12:35.980\n having maybe saying a few jokes, laughing.\n\n1:12:35.980 --> 1:12:38.100\n This is a real day, make it real.\n\n1:12:38.100 --> 1:12:42.780\n Going back and packing your judo bag for the day,\n\n1:12:42.780 --> 1:12:45.820\n getting on the bus, driving to the venue,\n\n1:12:45.820 --> 1:12:49.420\n feel what it's like walking into the stadium\n\n1:12:49.420 --> 1:12:52.060\n for the first time, going to the warmup area,\n\n1:12:52.060 --> 1:12:54.620\n seeing your drawer up on the sheet,\n\n1:12:54.620 --> 1:12:56.660\n who you're gonna fight that day,\n\n1:12:56.660 --> 1:12:59.740\n watching yourself warm up, go through your warmup routine,\n\n1:13:00.940 --> 1:13:03.500\n walking out of the shoot, into the venue,\n\n1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:05.380\n going to do that first fight.\n\n1:13:05.380 --> 1:13:07.420\n Picture the moment of throwing your opponent,\n\n1:13:07.420 --> 1:13:10.700\n coming off the mat, high fiving the coach,\n\n1:13:10.700 --> 1:13:12.420\n getting ready for your second fight.\n\n1:13:12.420 --> 1:13:15.380\n Like live the day from start to finish\n\n1:13:15.380 --> 1:13:17.260\n and make it as real as possible.\n\n1:13:18.100 --> 1:13:20.860\n We're all the way to the moment where you've just won\n\n1:13:20.860 --> 1:13:23.380\n and you're raising your arms in celebration,\n\n1:13:23.380 --> 1:13:25.860\n you're bowing, you're hugging your opponent,\n\n1:13:25.860 --> 1:13:28.700\n you come off the mat, you hug your coach,\n\n1:13:28.700 --> 1:13:31.700\n you're running around the stadium with the flag,\n\n1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:34.700\n you stepped up on the podium, you heard your name,\n\n1:13:34.700 --> 1:13:36.860\n Olympic champion, Jimmy Pedro,\n\n1:13:36.860 --> 1:13:39.020\n like you heard the moment,\n\n1:13:39.020 --> 1:13:41.900\n the medal being put around your neck,\n\n1:13:41.900 --> 1:13:44.940\n picture the people coming up on the podium with you,\n\n1:13:44.940 --> 1:13:47.260\n arms around them, taking the pictures.\n\n1:13:47.260 --> 1:13:50.900\n Like the more real you can make it,\n\n1:13:50.900 --> 1:13:53.660\n even before it ever happens, right?\n\n1:13:54.660 --> 1:13:56.820\n When you do that enough times,\n\n1:13:57.700 --> 1:14:01.660\n I feel that like pathways get created for you\n\n1:14:01.660 --> 1:14:04.900\n so that when your body gets to that moment,\n\n1:14:04.900 --> 1:14:06.700\n and I've been here before, this is it,\n\n1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:08.900\n this is my moment, this is what I pictured my whole life,\n\n1:14:08.900 --> 1:14:11.100\n I'm not nervous, because I've seen this,\n\n1:14:11.100 --> 1:14:13.900\n this is gonna happen, I believe it's possible, right?\n\n1:14:13.900 --> 1:14:15.900\n And I believe the athletes that do that\n\n1:14:15.900 --> 1:14:19.620\n and make it real enough that when they get to that moment,\n\n1:14:19.620 --> 1:14:22.700\n they go right through, there's no hesitation.\n\n1:14:22.700 --> 1:14:25.340\n This is what this is meant to be, this is my destiny,\n\n1:14:25.340 --> 1:14:27.540\n this is why I did everything I did,\n\n1:14:27.540 --> 1:14:29.980\n versus the ones that don't think about it ever,\n\n1:14:29.980 --> 1:14:34.020\n but just kind of like hope, it's not real to them,\n\n1:14:34.020 --> 1:14:35.420\n it doesn't feel attainable,\n\n1:14:35.420 --> 1:14:36.740\n they don't believe it's possible,\n\n1:14:36.740 --> 1:14:39.940\n they haven't committed to believing it was possible.\n\n1:14:39.940 --> 1:14:42.780\n Without that commitment in yourself and that belief,\n\n1:14:42.780 --> 1:14:43.940\n it can't happen.\n\n1:14:43.940 --> 1:14:48.340\n And one thing that, I talked to Travis a bit about this,\n\n1:14:48.340 --> 1:14:51.180\n you probably worked with him on the details\n\n1:14:51.180 --> 1:14:52.740\n of what you're talking about,\n\n1:14:52.740 --> 1:14:55.180\n but he said that you should really\n\n1:14:56.900 --> 1:15:01.260\n focus on visualizing the sensations you feel.\n\n1:15:01.260 --> 1:15:04.660\n So say if you're drinking coffee or something like that,\n\n1:15:04.660 --> 1:15:08.900\n you're not thinking about like observing yourself\n\n1:15:08.900 --> 1:15:11.140\n from a third person perspective drinking coffee,\n\n1:15:11.140 --> 1:15:15.460\n like you're thinking of how your hand will feel\n\n1:15:15.460 --> 1:15:17.140\n when it touches something warm.\n\n1:15:17.140 --> 1:15:20.020\n Like you try to replay the actual sensations\n\n1:15:20.020 --> 1:15:21.660\n you would feel, right?\n\n1:15:21.660 --> 1:15:24.980\n So it sounds kind of strange,\n\n1:15:24.980 --> 1:15:27.820\n but meaning like you really wanna put yourself in the body\n\n1:15:27.820 --> 1:15:30.420\n as you would experience those moments,\n\n1:15:30.420 --> 1:15:33.140\n as opposed to like watching yourself on TV\n\n1:15:33.140 --> 1:15:36.420\n experience in those moments, like really be inside.\n\n1:15:36.420 --> 1:15:38.220\n And yeah, so that means sensations,\n\n1:15:38.220 --> 1:15:40.460\n like how does it feel when you grip a gi?\n\n1:15:40.460 --> 1:15:45.180\n How does it, yeah, the sweating,\n\n1:15:45.180 --> 1:15:47.140\n just the sensation of sweat,\n\n1:15:47.140 --> 1:15:50.020\n like rolling down your forehead or whatever,\n\n1:15:50.020 --> 1:15:52.500\n like all of those actual feelings.\n\n1:15:52.500 --> 1:15:54.100\n When I explain it to you,\n\n1:15:54.100 --> 1:15:57.660\n like I guess my body has been through it so many times,\n\n1:15:57.660 --> 1:15:59.340\n both in my mind and in reality\n\n1:15:59.340 --> 1:16:03.060\n that it brings back all of those same emotions.\n\n1:16:03.060 --> 1:16:06.580\n I start to get goosebumps, my armpits start to sweat,\n\n1:16:06.580 --> 1:16:09.180\n like I'm living it if it's real.\n\n1:16:09.180 --> 1:16:10.500\n I'm reliving it now.\n\n1:16:10.500 --> 1:16:14.220\n But when you're going through the visualization process,\n\n1:16:14.220 --> 1:16:16.700\n it has to be that real, the smells,\n\n1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:18.740\n the taping of the fingers,\n\n1:16:18.740 --> 1:16:23.220\n like the more colorful and the more real you can make it,\n\n1:16:23.220 --> 1:16:25.500\n the more believable it is.\n\n1:16:25.500 --> 1:16:27.700\n So I've been doing this kind of thing,\n\n1:16:27.700 --> 1:16:30.540\n just having listened to you enough\n\n1:16:30.540 --> 1:16:34.180\n for other stuff in life, so let's see if it works.\n\n1:16:35.140 --> 1:16:37.140\n But do you see this kind of visualization\n\n1:16:37.140 --> 1:16:40.060\n being useful for other things in career\n\n1:16:40.060 --> 1:16:40.900\n and all those kinds of things?\n\n1:16:40.900 --> 1:16:45.900\n 100%, 100%, because I just know with my own life,\n\n1:16:46.380 --> 1:16:50.860\n my own experiences, like my wife sometimes says to me,\n\n1:16:50.860 --> 1:16:52.500\n she says, well, where do you see yourself\n\n1:16:52.500 --> 1:16:55.460\n in like five years from now?\n\n1:16:55.460 --> 1:16:58.820\n And five years ago, I had said to her,\n\n1:16:58.820 --> 1:17:00.460\n I wanna have my own business.\n\n1:17:00.460 --> 1:17:03.700\n I wanna have, this is the amount of money\n\n1:17:03.700 --> 1:17:05.540\n that I'm hoping I can make in a given year.\n\n1:17:05.540 --> 1:17:06.900\n Like you have to have goals for yourself.\n\n1:17:06.900 --> 1:17:08.900\n Like is this, if you put out there like,\n\n1:17:08.900 --> 1:17:11.860\n okay, I wanna make a million dollars in a year.\n\n1:17:11.860 --> 1:17:13.060\n That's a big number.\n\n1:17:13.060 --> 1:17:15.340\n Like for me or for the normal person,\n\n1:17:15.340 --> 1:17:16.860\n like that's a really big number.\n\n1:17:16.860 --> 1:17:17.700\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:17:17.700 --> 1:17:19.620\n Like it's not, especially when you're not making\n\n1:17:19.620 --> 1:17:22.740\n that much at the time, it's a super big number, right?\n\n1:17:22.740 --> 1:17:24.380\n So having those goals for yourself,\n\n1:17:24.380 --> 1:17:27.660\n like it won't happen and it's not possible\n\n1:17:27.660 --> 1:17:30.300\n unless you dream it's possible\n\n1:17:30.300 --> 1:17:31.780\n and think that it's possible.\n\n1:17:31.780 --> 1:17:34.060\n And then it doesn't magically happen.\n\n1:17:34.060 --> 1:17:35.900\n And maybe it doesn't happen in five years,\n\n1:17:35.900 --> 1:17:37.180\n maybe it happens in 10,\n\n1:17:37.180 --> 1:17:39.820\n but at least you're on the path to getting there.\n\n1:17:39.820 --> 1:17:40.660\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:17:40.660 --> 1:17:41.860\n And I said, I wanna own my own business.\n\n1:17:41.860 --> 1:17:44.300\n I wanna control my own destiny.\n\n1:17:44.300 --> 1:17:46.060\n I wanna be my own boss.\n\n1:17:46.060 --> 1:17:47.820\n I wanna make my own decisions.\n\n1:17:47.820 --> 1:17:49.980\n Like these are the things that I told her I wanted to do.\n\n1:17:49.980 --> 1:17:53.180\n And now I'm at that point,\n\n1:17:53.180 --> 1:17:55.260\n where I work for myself,\n\n1:17:55.260 --> 1:17:57.420\n I have my own company, I have partners obviously,\n\n1:17:57.420 --> 1:18:00.460\n but like if I wanna pick up and go somewhere for a week,\n\n1:18:00.460 --> 1:18:03.180\n I just do, I don't have to ask permission to do it, right?\n\n1:18:03.180 --> 1:18:05.060\n That's what life, freedom, right?\n\n1:18:05.060 --> 1:18:06.780\n That's what I'd like.\n\n1:18:06.780 --> 1:18:09.100\n And all of it starts with a dream.\n\n1:18:09.100 --> 1:18:12.740\n In the same with my dojo, when I first opened.\n\n1:18:12.740 --> 1:18:14.780\n So I ran a dojo for a long time\n\n1:18:14.780 --> 1:18:16.540\n and I only had 60 students always,\n\n1:18:16.540 --> 1:18:18.860\n like 40 to 60 students had fluctuated.\n\n1:18:19.860 --> 1:18:20.700\n And I sit there and say,\n\n1:18:20.700 --> 1:18:23.260\n why can't I get more people in my door, right?\n\n1:18:23.260 --> 1:18:25.300\n So I hired consultants to come in\n\n1:18:25.300 --> 1:18:27.580\n and look at my business and say why, right?\n\n1:18:27.580 --> 1:18:29.620\n And they came in and said,\n\n1:18:29.620 --> 1:18:31.420\n well, this place is really intimidating.\n\n1:18:31.420 --> 1:18:33.100\n Like if I was coming in off the street,\n\n1:18:33.100 --> 1:18:35.300\n the first thing I see is this big Olympic champion\n\n1:18:35.300 --> 1:18:37.780\n on the wall and I see this training that's going on\n\n1:18:37.780 --> 1:18:40.140\n and these guys are flying through the air and landing hard.\n\n1:18:40.140 --> 1:18:41.780\n And as a white belt, you're telling me\n\n1:18:41.780 --> 1:18:42.840\n that's the class for me?\n\n1:18:42.840 --> 1:18:44.580\n Like no way, I'm not gonna do that.\n\n1:18:44.580 --> 1:18:47.620\n So like I listened to these people and I said, you're right.\n\n1:18:47.620 --> 1:18:51.140\n And the training was hour and a half, two hours long.\n\n1:18:51.140 --> 1:18:53.300\n People can't handle an hour and a half or two hours training\n\n1:18:53.300 --> 1:18:54.260\n when they're first walking in the door.\n\n1:18:54.260 --> 1:18:56.980\n So I had to restructure all my programming.\n\n1:18:56.980 --> 1:19:00.260\n I had to look at the way I was offering my school\n\n1:19:00.260 --> 1:19:02.900\n and I had to make levels for everybody, right?\n\n1:19:02.900 --> 1:19:05.620\n Like here's my four to six year old class.\n\n1:19:05.620 --> 1:19:07.780\n Here's my six to 13 year old class.\n\n1:19:07.780 --> 1:19:09.860\n There's all my beginner classes.\n\n1:19:09.860 --> 1:19:11.660\n They don't mix in with the advanced people.\n\n1:19:11.660 --> 1:19:16.660\n And I had to learn how to make it accessible for everybody\n\n1:19:16.660 --> 1:19:19.580\n instead of just the people that wanted to train hard.\n\n1:19:19.580 --> 1:19:22.180\n And then the challenge was, okay,\n\n1:19:22.180 --> 1:19:25.020\n if you can have a lot of people in your dojo training,\n\n1:19:25.020 --> 1:19:26.140\n it's a recreational school.\n\n1:19:26.140 --> 1:19:28.340\n You can't produce champions at that same school.\n\n1:19:28.340 --> 1:19:29.780\n That's what I was told.\n\n1:19:29.780 --> 1:19:31.740\n So then I got all my black belts together\n\n1:19:31.740 --> 1:19:33.660\n and I said, listen, this is my vision.\n\n1:19:33.660 --> 1:19:34.860\n This is what I want.\n\n1:19:34.860 --> 1:19:38.220\n I wanna have a club that has over 200 judo only athletes,\n\n1:19:38.220 --> 1:19:41.780\n no jujitsu, no karate, nothing, judo only.\n\n1:19:41.780 --> 1:19:43.820\n I want over 200 people.\n\n1:19:43.820 --> 1:19:46.700\n And in the inside of that dojo, I wanna have Olympic\n\n1:19:46.700 --> 1:19:49.060\n champions and I wanna have recreational,\n\n1:19:49.060 --> 1:19:51.260\n like little kids, five and six years old,\n\n1:19:51.260 --> 1:19:53.820\n older guys in their seventies train, I don't care,\n\n1:19:53.820 --> 1:19:55.660\n but I want the spectrum of recreational\n\n1:19:55.660 --> 1:19:57.260\n and I want Olympic champions.\n\n1:19:57.260 --> 1:20:00.420\n The only way to do that is to take your instructors\n\n1:20:00.420 --> 1:20:03.340\n and say, you're gonna do this, define the roles,\n\n1:20:03.340 --> 1:20:04.820\n who's gonna be the recreational coach,\n\n1:20:04.820 --> 1:20:06.260\n who's gonna be the competitive coach.\n\n1:20:06.260 --> 1:20:08.620\n How do we separate these programs?\n\n1:20:08.620 --> 1:20:10.740\n And lo and behold, that was my vision that I shared\n\n1:20:10.740 --> 1:20:15.020\n with all of them and that was back in 2006.\n\n1:20:15.900 --> 1:20:19.820\n And by 2012, we've got Olympic champion Kayla Harrison,\n\n1:20:19.820 --> 1:20:21.940\n we have over 200 people at the school,\n\n1:20:21.940 --> 1:20:24.260\n we have a successful thriving business,\n\n1:20:24.260 --> 1:20:26.780\n but it doesn't happen without that vision,\n\n1:20:26.780 --> 1:20:30.460\n a plan and believing that it's possible.\n\n1:20:30.460 --> 1:20:32.500\n Believing that it's possible.\n\n1:20:32.500 --> 1:20:36.700\n I don't know, but I personally have on top of that\n\n1:20:36.700 --> 1:20:41.700\n almost like very specific visions of a future.\n\n1:20:41.860 --> 1:20:44.660\n Like, I don't know what,\n\n1:20:44.660 --> 1:20:46.700\n cause I don't wanna give actual examples.\n\n1:20:46.700 --> 1:20:51.700\n Cause for several reasons, one of which is just people\n\n1:20:51.700 --> 1:20:56.100\n will, as they often have, they often will in your life,\n\n1:20:56.100 --> 1:20:59.380\n they'll just laugh at it a little bit,\n\n1:20:59.380 --> 1:21:00.820\n like that seems silly.\n\n1:21:02.260 --> 1:21:05.300\n And I don't, I'm very hesitant to share certain things\n\n1:21:05.300 --> 1:21:07.140\n like that with people because they'll,\n\n1:21:08.500 --> 1:21:12.660\n I mean, I'm with Johnny Ive, who's the lead designer\n\n1:21:12.660 --> 1:21:16.460\n in Apple, like you want that dream, that little flame\n\n1:21:16.460 --> 1:21:19.660\n to not, people will put that flame out too easily,\n\n1:21:19.660 --> 1:21:21.500\n even people that love you.\n\n1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:24.820\n So I have very specific kind of visions,\n\n1:21:26.820 --> 1:21:30.820\n like maybe for Travis, it would be like a specific opponent\n\n1:21:30.820 --> 1:21:34.220\n or something like Ole Bischoff, like very specific,\n\n1:21:34.220 --> 1:21:36.820\n very specific situation of what's going to happen.\n\n1:21:36.820 --> 1:21:39.220\n Not just like, I wanna be an Olympic champion,\n\n1:21:39.220 --> 1:21:43.100\n but very specific, like almost silly situations.\n\n1:21:43.100 --> 1:21:45.220\n Yeah, like the dynamic between Travis\n\n1:21:45.220 --> 1:21:47.740\n and Ole Bischoff or something, like maybe visualize that.\n\n1:21:47.740 --> 1:21:50.980\n For me, that helps because it makes it all real,\n\n1:21:50.980 --> 1:21:52.340\n even more real.\n\n1:21:52.340 --> 1:21:55.500\n It's not like some big goal, like a million dollars\n\n1:21:55.500 --> 1:21:58.060\n or something like that, which is also really important\n\n1:21:58.060 --> 1:22:00.180\n to have because you can measure it and so on.\n\n1:22:00.180 --> 1:22:05.180\n But it's just like you belong in those situations.\n\n1:22:05.580 --> 1:22:08.900\n Just believing you belong there.\n\n1:22:08.900 --> 1:22:09.740\n It's not the default.\n\n1:22:09.740 --> 1:22:10.580\n It can be you.\n\n1:22:10.580 --> 1:22:11.740\n Yeah, it could be you.\n\n1:22:11.740 --> 1:22:13.620\n And for some reason, that really helps me,\n\n1:22:13.620 --> 1:22:15.100\n the little details.\n\n1:22:15.100 --> 1:22:15.940\n Sure.\n\n1:22:15.940 --> 1:22:18.740\n Like visualizing, most of them are almost\n\n1:22:18.740 --> 1:22:23.260\n a little bit funny, like focusing on the funniness.\n\n1:22:23.260 --> 1:22:28.060\n It's the mundaneness of it helps me a lot.\n\n1:22:28.060 --> 1:22:30.220\n And all the people that have done great things,\n\n1:22:30.220 --> 1:22:31.820\n they're just human too.\n\n1:22:31.820 --> 1:22:36.060\n Correct, and I think a lot of people overestimate\n\n1:22:36.060 --> 1:22:41.060\n who others are and sell themselves too short.\n\n1:22:42.300 --> 1:22:45.060\n Because at the end of the day, everybody started\n\n1:22:45.980 --> 1:22:47.420\n like everybody else, really.\n\n1:22:47.420 --> 1:22:49.340\n I mean, we did.\n\n1:22:49.340 --> 1:22:50.180\n We're all infants.\n\n1:22:50.180 --> 1:22:51.660\n We couldn't walk, we couldn't talk,\n\n1:22:51.660 --> 1:22:52.500\n we couldn't do anything.\n\n1:22:52.500 --> 1:22:54.300\n We learned along the way.\n\n1:22:54.300 --> 1:22:57.620\n And I think that's the one thing that I realized is that,\n\n1:22:57.620 --> 1:23:00.100\n and I tell this to my athletes,\n\n1:23:00.100 --> 1:23:03.340\n but I also tell it to my recreational students,\n\n1:23:03.340 --> 1:23:06.980\n nobody is better than you are, nobody,\n\n1:23:06.980 --> 1:23:08.540\n unless you allow them to be.\n\n1:23:09.540 --> 1:23:11.580\n If you really want something to happen,\n\n1:23:11.580 --> 1:23:16.420\n then like map the plan, believe in yourself,\n\n1:23:16.420 --> 1:23:20.700\n decide, and know full out, you're gonna fail a lot.\n\n1:23:20.700 --> 1:23:22.340\n You're gonna get beat down.\n\n1:23:22.340 --> 1:23:23.620\n You're gonna have losses.\n\n1:23:23.620 --> 1:23:25.540\n You're gonna have struggles.\n\n1:23:25.540 --> 1:23:27.260\n And I think that's the one thing with social media today\n\n1:23:27.260 --> 1:23:30.620\n is that everybody sees everybody succeed.\n\n1:23:30.620 --> 1:23:32.300\n Nobody posts the picture when they're on the ground\n\n1:23:32.300 --> 1:23:33.740\n and fail, you're losing.\n\n1:23:33.740 --> 1:23:36.140\n Like nobody sees when you broke your arm\n\n1:23:36.140 --> 1:23:37.780\n and you had to go through rehab,\n\n1:23:37.780 --> 1:23:39.580\n whatever it is, like had your injuries\n\n1:23:39.580 --> 1:23:41.460\n and you were on your couch watching TV\n\n1:23:41.460 --> 1:23:43.500\n and you were suffering and you were like,\n\n1:23:43.500 --> 1:23:47.020\n everybody has really, really dark, bad moments in their life\n\n1:23:47.020 --> 1:23:50.260\n and defeats and losses and suffrage.\n\n1:23:50.260 --> 1:23:53.180\n And it's only at the end after they've recovered\n\n1:23:53.180 --> 1:23:55.420\n from all of that, they've reclimbed up the mountain\n\n1:23:55.420 --> 1:23:56.660\n and they've gone to the pinnacle\n\n1:23:56.660 --> 1:23:59.780\n that you see them on social media with the medal, right?\n\n1:23:59.780 --> 1:24:03.140\n But everybody else like struggles and was human\n\n1:24:03.140 --> 1:24:05.300\n and failed many, many times.\n\n1:24:05.300 --> 1:24:10.300\n And convincing yourself that you're capable,\n\n1:24:10.380 --> 1:24:12.620\n I think is the first start of everything.\n\n1:24:12.620 --> 1:24:15.580\n Do you need people in your life that believe in you\n\n1:24:15.580 --> 1:24:19.020\n or should most of it come from within yourself?\n\n1:24:19.020 --> 1:24:21.060\n I think most of it has to come in from,\n\n1:24:21.060 --> 1:24:25.540\n it certainly helps, but it has to come from you first.\n\n1:24:25.540 --> 1:24:28.940\n You have to be driven, like other people can help you\n\n1:24:28.940 --> 1:24:31.500\n define where you wanna go and help you get there\n\n1:24:31.500 --> 1:24:33.940\n and encourage you and can support you\n\n1:24:33.940 --> 1:24:37.940\n and whether it's resource wise or with connections\n\n1:24:37.940 --> 1:24:39.780\n and like they can help with that path,\n\n1:24:39.780 --> 1:24:42.780\n but that first part has to come from you.\n\n1:24:42.780 --> 1:24:45.620\n It has to be your passion, your desire,\n\n1:24:45.620 --> 1:24:48.380\n your commitment to yourself.\n\n1:24:48.380 --> 1:24:49.980\n You're the one that's gonna ultimately make\n\n1:24:49.980 --> 1:24:51.820\n all the sacrifices to do it.\n\n1:24:51.820 --> 1:24:54.460\n So it has to be your decision, not your parents,\n\n1:24:54.460 --> 1:24:56.620\n not your spouses, something that you're\n\n1:24:56.620 --> 1:24:57.980\n really motivated to do.\n\n1:24:59.340 --> 1:25:01.340\n Let me ask you about Travis, Kayla,\n\n1:25:01.340 --> 1:25:03.260\n and maybe a few of the other athletes\n\n1:25:03.260 --> 1:25:04.100\n you've been involved with.\n\n1:25:04.100 --> 1:25:05.380\n So first, Travis.\n\n1:25:06.580 --> 1:25:11.580\n Travis Stevens, Olympic silver medalist,\n\n1:25:11.820 --> 1:25:16.820\n three time Olympian, 2008, 2012, 2016.\n\n1:25:17.140 --> 1:25:20.300\n What makes Travis Stevens great?\n\n1:25:20.300 --> 1:25:23.060\n What makes him so successful?\n\n1:25:23.060 --> 1:25:25.740\n What makes him unique in your mind as an athlete?\n\n1:25:26.660 --> 1:25:29.820\n Through all the hardship he had to overcome,\n\n1:25:29.820 --> 1:25:32.580\n through his weird looking sayonagi\n\n1:25:32.580 --> 1:25:36.180\n that eventually worked out nicely,\n\n1:25:36.180 --> 1:25:39.020\n through the full richness of his personality,\n\n1:25:39.020 --> 1:25:41.140\n in the context of all the other great athletes\n\n1:25:41.140 --> 1:25:43.140\n you've coached, what makes him special?\n\n1:25:45.460 --> 1:25:48.220\n His fight, Travis has fight.\n\n1:25:48.220 --> 1:25:50.700\n And you know, the first time I ever saw Travis Stevens\n\n1:25:50.700 --> 1:25:54.220\n was in, like recognized him, maybe I had seen him before\n\n1:25:54.220 --> 1:25:55.340\n as a younger boy or something,\n\n1:25:55.340 --> 1:25:57.860\n but like actually recognized him as,\n\n1:25:57.860 --> 1:26:00.940\n I brought a group of young kids to Italy\n\n1:26:00.940 --> 1:26:03.140\n for a competition in a training camp.\n\n1:26:03.140 --> 1:26:06.220\n And it was this program called U23 Elite.\n\n1:26:06.220 --> 1:26:10.780\n And I picked, handpicked 20 kids to go to this event.\n\n1:26:10.780 --> 1:26:14.260\n And it was the first time I coached an international team.\n\n1:26:15.140 --> 1:26:17.060\n And I had never seen Travis fight before,\n\n1:26:17.060 --> 1:26:18.820\n compete, train, anything.\n\n1:26:18.820 --> 1:26:21.500\n And during this competition, you know,\n\n1:26:21.500 --> 1:26:22.860\n he's an 81 kilo player.\n\n1:26:22.860 --> 1:26:27.860\n I think he was maybe like 18 years old, 17, 18 years old.\n\n1:26:28.100 --> 1:26:31.140\n And it was a really hard European event.\n\n1:26:31.140 --> 1:26:34.820\n And I think Travis won three matches and he lost two.\n\n1:26:34.820 --> 1:26:37.260\n But what stood out the most to me was like,\n\n1:26:37.260 --> 1:26:39.220\n the fight he had in him.\n\n1:26:39.220 --> 1:26:41.260\n He was scrapping every fight.\n\n1:26:41.260 --> 1:26:42.580\n Like he scrapped hard.\n\n1:26:42.580 --> 1:26:45.140\n Like he wanted to win more than any of them, right?\n\n1:26:45.140 --> 1:26:47.380\n He didn't win, but he wanted to win more.\n\n1:26:47.380 --> 1:26:49.700\n And I noticed that right away.\n\n1:26:49.700 --> 1:26:52.620\n And then I also noticed that after he lost his second match\n\n1:26:52.620 --> 1:26:54.380\n and he was eliminated from the tournament,\n\n1:26:54.380 --> 1:26:57.020\n I saw how disappointed he was in himself.\n\n1:26:57.020 --> 1:26:58.740\n Like he actually thought he was supposed\n\n1:26:58.740 --> 1:26:59.820\n to beat those people.\n\n1:26:59.820 --> 1:27:01.860\n Even though he was like 17, right?\n\n1:27:01.860 --> 1:27:03.660\n And he's fighting against grown men that are,\n\n1:27:03.660 --> 1:27:06.220\n you know, a high level judo, much higher than he was.\n\n1:27:06.220 --> 1:27:07.260\n And I said to him, I said,\n\n1:27:07.260 --> 1:27:09.740\n hey son, like, don't worry, man.\n\n1:27:09.740 --> 1:27:11.180\n You got a long career ahead of you.\n\n1:27:11.180 --> 1:27:13.580\n Like, I'm glad you're disappointed,\n\n1:27:13.580 --> 1:27:15.700\n but there's so many things you don't know\n\n1:27:15.700 --> 1:27:17.660\n and so many skills you don't have.\n\n1:27:17.660 --> 1:27:19.500\n The fact that you were able to hold your own\n\n1:27:19.500 --> 1:27:21.860\n and scrap like that, like you've got a good future.\n\n1:27:21.860 --> 1:27:24.900\n And I remember calling my friend, Jason Morris,\n\n1:27:24.900 --> 1:27:26.460\n after that tournament.\n\n1:27:26.460 --> 1:27:27.300\n And I said, hey man,\n\n1:27:27.300 --> 1:27:29.780\n did you ever hear of this kid, Travis Stevens?\n\n1:27:29.780 --> 1:27:30.860\n He says, no, why?\n\n1:27:30.860 --> 1:27:33.020\n I said, man, that kid's got some fight in him, right?\n\n1:27:33.020 --> 1:27:35.740\n And I said that, I said that to Jason at the time.\n\n1:27:35.740 --> 1:27:37.220\n I said, that kid's got some fight in him, man.\n\n1:27:37.220 --> 1:27:38.940\n He's pretty talented, you know?\n\n1:27:38.940 --> 1:27:40.220\n And that's how it started.\n\n1:27:41.340 --> 1:27:43.420\n But so I saw that in him when he was young.\n\n1:27:43.420 --> 1:27:46.260\n But the other thing was, Travis,\n\n1:27:46.260 --> 1:27:50.380\n like, there's no such thing as hard work to that guy.\n\n1:27:50.380 --> 1:27:52.420\n If you tell him to put his head through the wall\n\n1:27:52.420 --> 1:27:53.900\n and that's how he wins,\n\n1:27:53.900 --> 1:27:55.180\n he'll go put his head through the wall.\n\n1:27:55.180 --> 1:28:00.180\n He'll do whatever it takes for him to do to achieve success.\n\n1:28:00.980 --> 1:28:05.980\n And he hates failure more than he likes winning, 100%.\n\n1:28:08.140 --> 1:28:08.980\n He always has.\n\n1:28:08.980 --> 1:28:11.100\n He punishes himself when he doesn't do well.\n\n1:28:11.100 --> 1:28:12.620\n He makes himself work harder.\n\n1:28:12.620 --> 1:28:17.620\n He goes and just abuses himself when he doesn't succeed\n\n1:28:19.060 --> 1:28:22.220\n because he's so heartbroken and disappointed in himself.\n\n1:28:22.220 --> 1:28:24.900\n So that's a trait that I think all of the athletes\n\n1:28:24.900 --> 1:28:28.940\n that I work with closely, they all had that same trait.\n\n1:28:28.940 --> 1:28:30.860\n They hated losing more than anything.\n\n1:28:30.860 --> 1:28:31.900\n They would break their arm.\n\n1:28:31.900 --> 1:28:33.580\n They'd fall on their head.\n\n1:28:33.580 --> 1:28:36.860\n They'd rather get hit by a car than lose a judo tournament.\n\n1:28:36.860 --> 1:28:39.300\n And as a result, then they all had fight\n\n1:28:39.300 --> 1:28:40.780\n and they all were willing to train.\n\n1:28:40.780 --> 1:28:42.140\n They were willing to listen.\n\n1:28:42.140 --> 1:28:44.620\n They would do anything for victory.\n\n1:28:44.620 --> 1:28:47.380\n Within the rules, I'm not talking about taking drugs\n\n1:28:47.380 --> 1:28:48.220\n or anything like that,\n\n1:28:48.220 --> 1:28:52.660\n but they'd give 100% of themselves for victory.\n\n1:28:52.660 --> 1:28:56.020\n And Travis was somebody that when he was down,\n\n1:28:56.020 --> 1:28:58.660\n he found a way to get better doing something else.\n\n1:28:58.660 --> 1:29:01.500\n If he couldn't do standing, that's when he started jujitsu.\n\n1:29:01.500 --> 1:29:03.100\n He couldn't go on his feet anymore.\n\n1:29:03.100 --> 1:29:04.820\n He couldn't stand up and train.\n\n1:29:04.820 --> 1:29:06.380\n Might as well go learn jujitsu\n\n1:29:06.380 --> 1:29:09.300\n and get good on the ground because I can.\n\n1:29:09.300 --> 1:29:11.780\n So he always found a way no matter what obstacle\n\n1:29:11.780 --> 1:29:14.260\n was in his way, he just went around it.\n\n1:29:14.260 --> 1:29:18.100\n So what about, it'd be interesting to get your perspective\n\n1:29:18.100 --> 1:29:19.940\n because I know Travis's perspective\n\n1:29:19.940 --> 1:29:24.180\n is just the number of injuries.\n\n1:29:24.180 --> 1:29:26.380\n Like what do you make of the perseverance\n\n1:29:26.380 --> 1:29:28.780\n through all the injuries he had to overcome?\n\n1:29:28.780 --> 1:29:31.820\n Specifically like you just observing this creature\n\n1:29:31.820 --> 1:29:33.420\n that you've coached.\n\n1:29:33.420 --> 1:29:37.180\n I mean, he seems to not see the injuries as a problem.\n\n1:29:37.180 --> 1:29:40.740\n He just like, just like you said, head through the wall.\n\n1:29:40.740 --> 1:29:44.780\n It's like what, like when we were talking about injuries,\n\n1:29:44.780 --> 1:29:48.460\n he kinda, he doesn't even see the injuries themselves\n\n1:29:48.460 --> 1:29:51.860\n as the problem because he thinks that the injuries,\n\n1:29:51.860 --> 1:29:53.700\n you know, you heal back stronger.\n\n1:29:54.500 --> 1:29:57.220\n I forget the exact quote, but he said like,\n\n1:29:57.220 --> 1:30:02.220\n my body is now less injury prone than most of anyone else.\n\n1:30:02.860 --> 1:30:03.700\n Because I've already broken everything.\n\n1:30:03.700 --> 1:30:07.260\n I've broken everything and it's just grown back stronger.\n\n1:30:07.260 --> 1:30:08.580\n Like, cause I asked him something like,\n\n1:30:08.580 --> 1:30:10.940\n do you regret sort of pushing your body\n\n1:30:10.940 --> 1:30:15.060\n to all of those places that resulted in those injuries?\n\n1:30:15.060 --> 1:30:19.500\n He was, his response was like, no, I'm stronger now.\n\n1:30:19.500 --> 1:30:21.860\n So I don't know if that's justification,\n\n1:30:21.860 --> 1:30:24.700\n but that certainly describes a mindset that,\n\n1:30:24.700 --> 1:30:26.420\n yeah, head through the wall.\n\n1:30:26.420 --> 1:30:30.620\n That doesn't, it's almost not dramatic.\n\n1:30:30.620 --> 1:30:32.460\n Like, look, I got this injury.\n\n1:30:32.460 --> 1:30:35.220\n It's so, I'm so like brave and special\n\n1:30:35.220 --> 1:30:36.380\n for overcoming this injury.\n\n1:30:36.380 --> 1:30:39.900\n He's just, he's just, that's part of the job\n\n1:30:39.900 --> 1:30:41.580\n and he gets the job done.\n\n1:30:41.580 --> 1:30:44.380\n But like that job involves a lot of injuries.\n\n1:30:44.380 --> 1:30:46.780\n One of the talks I gave Travis and that team\n\n1:30:46.780 --> 1:30:49.940\n at that particular tournament was at the very beginning\n\n1:30:49.940 --> 1:30:52.540\n of the camp after the tournament, I said to them, listen,\n\n1:30:52.540 --> 1:30:54.620\n my vision, I shared my vision with them.\n\n1:30:54.620 --> 1:30:57.940\n I said, my vision is, you know, in seven years,\n\n1:30:57.940 --> 1:31:00.740\n cause that was 2005, I said in seven years,\n\n1:31:00.740 --> 1:31:04.340\n I wanna have a US team that steps on the mat\n\n1:31:04.340 --> 1:31:06.300\n that is ready to kick ass.\n\n1:31:06.300 --> 1:31:07.980\n And in order to get there,\n\n1:31:07.980 --> 1:31:09.820\n all of you guys can be a part of this team\n\n1:31:09.820 --> 1:31:10.820\n and part of this process.\n\n1:31:10.820 --> 1:31:12.340\n But in order to get there,\n\n1:31:12.340 --> 1:31:14.420\n you guys have to be the first ones to practice.\n\n1:31:14.420 --> 1:31:15.900\n You have to be the last ones to leave\n\n1:31:15.900 --> 1:31:18.740\n cause we have to work harder than the rest of the world\n\n1:31:18.740 --> 1:31:20.620\n because we're up against all odds.\n\n1:31:20.620 --> 1:31:24.220\n I said, I am sick of America being a laughing stock of judo\n\n1:31:24.220 --> 1:31:26.740\n and being the first round, easy match,\n\n1:31:26.740 --> 1:31:28.780\n warmup for everybody else.\n\n1:31:28.780 --> 1:31:30.820\n I said, if you get injured,\n\n1:31:30.820 --> 1:31:33.580\n you're not gonna be on the side with, you know,\n\n1:31:33.580 --> 1:31:36.140\n with a ice bag on taking off rounds.\n\n1:31:36.140 --> 1:31:37.900\n And then get back on the mat the next day\n\n1:31:37.900 --> 1:31:39.100\n and tell me you're okay.\n\n1:31:39.100 --> 1:31:41.340\n If you can train the next day, you can train today.\n\n1:31:41.340 --> 1:31:42.220\n So there's no injury.\n\n1:31:42.220 --> 1:31:44.160\n The only time you'll leave in this dojo\n\n1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:46.580\n is if the ambulance has to take you out of here.\n\n1:31:46.580 --> 1:31:48.940\n You know, and I do think subliminally,\n\n1:31:48.940 --> 1:31:53.100\n Travis bought into that message and heard that message then,\n\n1:31:53.100 --> 1:31:54.340\n said, if I'm gonna be a champion,\n\n1:31:54.340 --> 1:31:55.620\n that's the way I'm gonna do it.\n\n1:31:55.620 --> 1:31:58.940\n And he did, and he embodied it, he lived it.\n\n1:31:58.940 --> 1:32:02.540\n Man, do it many times in Europe where I said,\n\n1:32:02.540 --> 1:32:05.220\n dude, just tape it up, go off to the side,\n\n1:32:05.220 --> 1:32:07.620\n just take the day off, like, take the rest of the day off,\n\n1:32:07.620 --> 1:32:08.860\n you're beat up, you can't do it.\n\n1:32:08.860 --> 1:32:10.380\n He said, no, no, I'm gonna tape it up, I'm gonna tape it up.\n\n1:32:10.380 --> 1:32:12.440\n I said, no, you don't need to right now.\n\n1:32:12.440 --> 1:32:14.420\n And he said, no, sensei, I'm doing it.\n\n1:32:14.420 --> 1:32:17.020\n You know, the ambulance isn't taking me out,\n\n1:32:17.020 --> 1:32:20.380\n it's just my wrist, it's just my ankle, it's just my wrist.\n\n1:32:20.380 --> 1:32:23.260\n It's just my ankle, yeah, I love it.\n\n1:32:23.260 --> 1:32:27.160\n Yeah, what about the, so the other really big thing\n\n1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:30.500\n is you comment on a little bit is the weight cut.\n\n1:32:30.500 --> 1:32:33.860\n So early in his career, he was 81 kg,\n\n1:32:33.860 --> 1:32:37.220\n and that was presumably not so difficult.\n\n1:32:37.220 --> 1:32:40.420\n But later in his career, he is 81 kg,\n\n1:32:40.420 --> 1:32:42.980\n and it's becoming more and more difficult.\n\n1:32:42.980 --> 1:32:47.140\n So that's the other thing with him is,\n\n1:32:47.140 --> 1:32:50.380\n so I've known a lot of really, really tough people\n\n1:32:50.380 --> 1:32:53.100\n at the highest levels broken by the weight cut.\n\n1:32:53.100 --> 1:32:55.480\n Like that can break the toughest minds.\n\n1:32:55.480 --> 1:32:58.020\n And it doesn't seem to have broken him.\n\n1:32:58.020 --> 1:33:03.020\n And he's delivered on it often, on like insane weight cuts.\n\n1:33:03.020 --> 1:33:06.820\n So just as a coach, what do you think about his,\n\n1:33:06.820 --> 1:33:10.740\n particularly his mind and the challenge of the weight cut?\n\n1:33:10.740 --> 1:33:12.420\n It was part of his process.\n\n1:33:12.420 --> 1:33:15.140\n It was part of his way of getting ready for battle.\n\n1:33:15.140 --> 1:33:16.180\n Suffering?\n\n1:33:16.180 --> 1:33:17.860\n Yeah, it really was.\n\n1:33:17.860 --> 1:33:20.460\n And if I'm gonna suffer this much,\n\n1:33:20.460 --> 1:33:22.460\n then I'm gonna make my opponents pay\n\n1:33:22.460 --> 1:33:24.860\n for all the suffering that I went through to get here.\n\n1:33:24.860 --> 1:33:26.020\n That was his mindset.\n\n1:33:27.500 --> 1:33:29.100\n Later on in his career, you're right,\n\n1:33:29.100 --> 1:33:31.260\n like a lot of times, Travis,\n\n1:33:31.260 --> 1:33:33.420\n he would never step on a scale\n\n1:33:33.420 --> 1:33:35.180\n until he got to the tournament.\n\n1:33:35.180 --> 1:33:37.580\n And even when he get to the tournament,\n\n1:33:37.580 --> 1:33:39.540\n like he'd weigh like 90 kilos.\n\n1:33:39.540 --> 1:33:42.540\n He'd show up at the tournament nine kilos over.\n\n1:33:42.540 --> 1:33:44.740\n I'm like, you have to, but I never,\n\n1:33:44.740 --> 1:33:47.600\n it was just an expectation of making weight.\n\n1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:49.340\n Not making weight was never an option\n\n1:33:49.340 --> 1:33:50.680\n for any of our athletes.\n\n1:33:50.680 --> 1:33:52.180\n And Travis knew it.\n\n1:33:52.180 --> 1:33:56.380\n And he said, as a professional, my job is to make weight.\n\n1:33:56.380 --> 1:33:57.620\n If I don't make weight,\n\n1:33:57.620 --> 1:34:00.620\n he was never gonna allow that to happen.\n\n1:34:00.620 --> 1:34:02.780\n And he was never gonna allow us to come to him and say,\n\n1:34:02.780 --> 1:34:04.940\n hey, I told you.\n\n1:34:04.940 --> 1:34:07.820\n Cause losing wasn't an option,\n\n1:34:07.820 --> 1:34:08.900\n making weight wasn't,\n\n1:34:08.900 --> 1:34:11.740\n not making weight was not an option for him ever either.\n\n1:34:11.740 --> 1:34:14.340\n But a lot of times he wouldn't even,\n\n1:34:14.340 --> 1:34:16.360\n he'd be nine kilos over on the plane\n\n1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:17.980\n going over to the tournament\n\n1:34:17.980 --> 1:34:20.220\n and have to make weight three days later.\n\n1:34:20.220 --> 1:34:22.140\n And he didn't break 86 kilos\n\n1:34:23.100 --> 1:34:24.740\n until the day before the tournament.\n\n1:34:24.740 --> 1:34:26.780\n Like he had five kilos over the day before.\n\n1:34:26.780 --> 1:34:27.780\n That was his way.\n\n1:34:27.780 --> 1:34:30.500\n But he would do three workouts\n\n1:34:30.500 --> 1:34:31.740\n to wake up in the morning and work out.\n\n1:34:31.740 --> 1:34:32.580\n Then he'd eat.\n\n1:34:32.580 --> 1:34:33.700\n Then he'd work out in the afternoon.\n\n1:34:33.700 --> 1:34:34.540\n Then he'd eat again.\n\n1:34:34.540 --> 1:34:36.580\n Then he'd work out again at night.\n\n1:34:36.580 --> 1:34:37.820\n And then he'd reward himself.\n\n1:34:37.820 --> 1:34:38.980\n Hey, I worked out three times today.\n\n1:34:38.980 --> 1:34:41.540\n He'd go have a, you know, a Mountain Dew.\n\n1:34:41.540 --> 1:34:42.380\n Yeah.\n\n1:34:42.380 --> 1:34:43.740\n You know, or a chocolate bar.\n\n1:34:43.740 --> 1:34:44.580\n You know?\n\n1:34:44.580 --> 1:34:47.380\n And then his next morning, he's back up to 87\n\n1:34:47.380 --> 1:34:49.980\n and he would never touch weight\n\n1:34:49.980 --> 1:34:51.700\n until the morning of weigh ins.\n\n1:34:51.700 --> 1:34:54.220\n That's a, when he,\n\n1:34:54.220 --> 1:34:57.780\n he wasn't on weight for more than like five minutes.\n\n1:34:57.780 --> 1:35:00.820\n His process would break a lot of people.\n\n1:35:00.820 --> 1:35:03.540\n So the fact that he got the job done is...\n\n1:35:03.540 --> 1:35:06.220\n Not just the job done, but every single time\n\n1:35:06.220 --> 1:35:07.420\n he got the job done.\n\n1:35:07.420 --> 1:35:10.160\n And I made those athletes fight.\n\n1:35:10.160 --> 1:35:11.500\n We would fight in Paris.\n\n1:35:11.500 --> 1:35:13.300\n We would do a camp for a week,\n\n1:35:13.300 --> 1:35:15.420\n double session camp for a week.\n\n1:35:15.420 --> 1:35:17.540\n He'd be seven kilos over,\n\n1:35:17.540 --> 1:35:19.780\n have to fight the next weekend.\n\n1:35:19.780 --> 1:35:21.700\n We're talking two or three days later.\n\n1:35:21.700 --> 1:35:23.580\n You know, so not only did he make the weight,\n\n1:35:23.580 --> 1:35:26.460\n but he did a grueling training camp twice a day.\n\n1:35:26.460 --> 1:35:29.580\n And then cut weight and then fought again.\n\n1:35:29.580 --> 1:35:31.220\n Then did another camp for a week\n\n1:35:31.220 --> 1:35:32.820\n in double session training camp,\n\n1:35:32.820 --> 1:35:34.460\n and then fought on a third weekend in a row.\n\n1:35:34.460 --> 1:35:37.100\n And our athletes went through hell.\n\n1:35:37.100 --> 1:35:38.700\n You know, all of our athletes went through hell\n\n1:35:38.700 --> 1:35:42.340\n because on the tour around the world,\n\n1:35:42.340 --> 1:35:43.860\n they fought in every event.\n\n1:35:43.860 --> 1:35:45.020\n They did every camp.\n\n1:35:45.020 --> 1:35:46.580\n They fought in every event.\n\n1:35:46.580 --> 1:35:48.260\n Whereas most of the other teams,\n\n1:35:48.260 --> 1:35:50.180\n like Japan comes in and fights in Paris,\n\n1:35:50.180 --> 1:35:51.220\n then they go home.\n\n1:35:51.220 --> 1:35:52.740\n You know, they maybe do a camp for three days,\n\n1:35:52.740 --> 1:35:53.900\n then they go home.\n\n1:35:53.900 --> 1:35:56.700\n They don't stay in Europe for four or five weeks straight\n\n1:35:56.700 --> 1:35:57.980\n and fight in every tournament.\n\n1:35:57.980 --> 1:35:59.460\n And when you get to Germany,\n\n1:35:59.460 --> 1:36:01.340\n the Germans skip the French Open.\n\n1:36:01.340 --> 1:36:02.540\n They skip the camp in France.\n\n1:36:02.540 --> 1:36:04.220\n They're just getting ready for Germany.\n\n1:36:04.220 --> 1:36:06.180\n Our athletes already had two competitions,\n\n1:36:06.180 --> 1:36:09.100\n two training camps, three weight cuts now.\n\n1:36:09.100 --> 1:36:12.260\n And then, so they're not 100% when they fight in Germany,\n\n1:36:12.260 --> 1:36:14.740\n but that's all part of the experience they need,\n\n1:36:14.740 --> 1:36:15.980\n the training that they need\n\n1:36:15.980 --> 1:36:18.500\n that they don't get here in this country.\n\n1:36:18.500 --> 1:36:20.220\n And all of those were just preparation\n\n1:36:20.220 --> 1:36:23.500\n for our world championships or our Olympic games.\n\n1:36:23.500 --> 1:36:26.540\n So by the time our athletes got to those tournaments,\n\n1:36:26.540 --> 1:36:29.660\n they felt so strong, so rested, so like,\n\n1:36:29.660 --> 1:36:32.980\n man, this guy that felt like a monster in Germany\n\n1:36:32.980 --> 1:36:34.620\n feels like nothing today\n\n1:36:34.620 --> 1:36:37.260\n because you're fully rested now, you know?\n\n1:36:37.260 --> 1:36:38.340\n But part of the challenge\n\n1:36:38.340 --> 1:36:42.060\n is because the American team is smaller and more,\n\n1:36:42.060 --> 1:36:44.060\n I mean, just smaller,\n\n1:36:44.060 --> 1:36:49.060\n is all the different places you go to do the weight cut,\n\n1:36:49.060 --> 1:36:54.060\n to do the diet, to do the preparation or the recovery,\n\n1:36:54.420 --> 1:36:58.180\n there's, like that process changes every time.\n\n1:36:59.060 --> 1:37:01.580\n So you basically have to improvise a lot.\n\n1:37:01.580 --> 1:37:03.820\n So you show up to a hotel\n\n1:37:03.820 --> 1:37:05.700\n and how you do the weight cut, you don't know.\n\n1:37:05.700 --> 1:37:07.340\n And this is the different weather conditions.\n\n1:37:07.340 --> 1:37:11.140\n It's not, it's like, what is it?\n\n1:37:11.140 --> 1:37:12.540\n Rocky versus Drago, right?\n\n1:37:12.540 --> 1:37:13.380\n That's it.\n\n1:37:13.380 --> 1:37:15.180\n So you don't have, you have to just improvise.\n\n1:37:15.180 --> 1:37:16.860\n And that's also a fascinating part\n\n1:37:16.860 --> 1:37:18.100\n of the American judo story,\n\n1:37:18.100 --> 1:37:19.900\n which is like, you have to improvise more.\n\n1:37:19.900 --> 1:37:22.820\n Well, it was funny because when I, it was 1990,\n\n1:37:22.820 --> 1:37:25.020\n and it was at the Goodwill Games, right?\n\n1:37:25.020 --> 1:37:28.420\n And we were, it was a US Olympic committee type event.\n\n1:37:28.420 --> 1:37:31.580\n And so we're on the bus with the swim team.\n\n1:37:31.580 --> 1:37:34.500\n And it was me and Jason Morris on the American team,\n\n1:37:34.500 --> 1:37:36.420\n and we're going to the judo competition,\n\n1:37:36.420 --> 1:37:38.180\n but we're on the bus with the swim team.\n\n1:37:38.180 --> 1:37:40.780\n I'm sorry, we're going to the venue where we're staying.\n\n1:37:40.780 --> 1:37:42.660\n You know, I remember being like by ourselves\n\n1:37:42.660 --> 1:37:45.220\n with no staff, no manager, no coach,\n\n1:37:45.220 --> 1:37:48.300\n we're just by ourselves going to fight in Russia, right?\n\n1:37:48.300 --> 1:37:52.820\n And the swim team's on there with their full sweats\n\n1:37:52.820 --> 1:37:54.900\n and their staff and like their managers.\n\n1:37:54.900 --> 1:37:57.500\n And I heard the lady, the girl go,\n\n1:37:57.500 --> 1:37:58.700\n I'm sorry, this was 1994,\n\n1:37:58.700 --> 1:38:00.140\n because it was in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\n1:38:00.140 --> 1:38:02.660\n So I heard the little girl on the team,\n\n1:38:02.660 --> 1:38:03.700\n she goes up to the coach, she goes,\n\n1:38:03.700 --> 1:38:06.860\n coach, do you think you can send the massage therapist\n\n1:38:06.860 --> 1:38:08.020\n to my room at 10 a.m.?\n\n1:38:08.020 --> 1:38:10.300\n You know, I'm feeling kind of jet lag.\n\n1:38:10.300 --> 1:38:13.380\n I looked at, me and Jason looked at each other like,\n\n1:38:13.380 --> 1:38:17.660\n oh, she's scheduling a massage?\n\n1:38:17.660 --> 1:38:18.700\n We don't even have a staff.\n\n1:38:18.700 --> 1:38:20.380\n Like what the hell is going on here?\n\n1:38:20.380 --> 1:38:23.460\n You know, what a difference in sporting,\n\n1:38:23.460 --> 1:38:26.340\n you know, different sports within the same country,\n\n1:38:26.340 --> 1:38:27.180\n you know, and.\n\n1:38:27.180 --> 1:38:29.940\n But that, I mean, not to romanticize things,\n\n1:38:29.940 --> 1:38:32.620\n but that you do represent the spirit of the Olympics\n\n1:38:32.620 --> 1:38:37.340\n when you're kind of the improvisational nature of it.\n\n1:38:37.340 --> 1:38:41.540\n Cause it is just you, you and sometimes you and the coach\n\n1:38:41.540 --> 1:38:46.540\n and just pure guts and you against the world with no money.\n\n1:38:47.460 --> 1:38:48.540\n The warrior spirit.\n\n1:38:48.540 --> 1:38:49.660\n The warrior spirit.\n\n1:38:51.420 --> 1:38:53.100\n How did it feel like when he,\n\n1:38:53.100 --> 1:38:56.460\n after being in two Olympics,\n\n1:38:56.460 --> 1:38:59.060\n beating some of the best people in the world,\n\n1:38:59.060 --> 1:39:01.300\n facing some of the best people in the world\n\n1:39:01.300 --> 1:39:04.300\n and just barely losing,\n\n1:39:04.300 --> 1:39:06.100\n what did it feel like to you as a coach\n\n1:39:06.100 --> 1:39:08.620\n to see Travis Stevens win the silver medal?\n\n1:39:10.020 --> 1:39:11.420\n Electric.\n\n1:39:11.420 --> 1:39:16.420\n I like, first of all, in 2012 in London,\n\n1:39:16.860 --> 1:39:20.100\n it was like, it felt like somebody died.\n\n1:39:20.100 --> 1:39:21.540\n I'm not going to be, I'm not going to lie to you.\n\n1:39:21.540 --> 1:39:22.380\n Like.\n\n1:39:22.380 --> 1:39:23.420\n The Ole Bischoff match?\n\n1:39:23.420 --> 1:39:27.940\n Not, no, just seeing Travis not finish on the podium period.\n\n1:39:27.940 --> 1:39:30.300\n You know, in the Ole Bischoff match,\n\n1:39:30.300 --> 1:39:33.620\n I thought he won regardless of who won and who lost.\n\n1:39:33.620 --> 1:39:35.980\n He just left everything he had on that mat, right?\n\n1:39:35.980 --> 1:39:38.700\n 10 minutes of probably it was a 20 something minute match,\n\n1:39:38.700 --> 1:39:41.780\n but 10 minutes of fighting actually, right?\n\n1:39:41.780 --> 1:39:43.060\n He left everything he had.\n\n1:39:43.060 --> 1:39:44.460\n He wanted to be in the Olympic finals.\n\n1:39:44.460 --> 1:39:46.140\n He wanted to be Olympic champion.\n\n1:39:46.140 --> 1:39:47.860\n And when he didn't get that opportunity,\n\n1:39:47.860 --> 1:39:49.260\n he lost everything.\n\n1:39:49.260 --> 1:39:50.300\n He drained himself.\n\n1:39:50.300 --> 1:39:52.700\n He cried for 45 minutes straight.\n\n1:39:52.700 --> 1:39:53.820\n I couldn't regroup him.\n\n1:39:53.820 --> 1:39:54.780\n I couldn't get him up.\n\n1:39:54.780 --> 1:39:56.900\n I said, Travis, you've got to stop your crying.\n\n1:39:56.900 --> 1:39:58.460\n You've got to get off the floor.\n\n1:39:58.460 --> 1:40:00.220\n We've got a bronze medal fight.\n\n1:40:00.220 --> 1:40:03.780\n Like if you don't recover, you're not going to perform well.\n\n1:40:03.780 --> 1:40:04.940\n And he just didn't care.\n\n1:40:04.940 --> 1:40:06.980\n Like it was gold or nothing.\n\n1:40:06.980 --> 1:40:09.700\n And so when he walked out against the Canadian boy,\n\n1:40:09.700 --> 1:40:10.620\n he had beaten the Canadian.\n\n1:40:10.620 --> 1:40:11.980\n I think at that time,\n\n1:40:11.980 --> 1:40:14.020\n he had beaten that Canadian every single time,\n\n1:40:14.020 --> 1:40:16.060\n except for that bronze medal match.\n\n1:40:16.060 --> 1:40:18.460\n But he just didn't have the fight in him anymore.\n\n1:40:18.460 --> 1:40:19.700\n You know, he'd left it all in the match,\n\n1:40:19.700 --> 1:40:20.980\n in the Bischoff match.\n\n1:40:20.980 --> 1:40:23.180\n So to see him come back with zero, right?\n\n1:40:23.180 --> 1:40:26.780\n We just had a team where his best friend, Marty Malloy,\n\n1:40:26.780 --> 1:40:29.180\n won a bronze medal, right?\n\n1:40:29.180 --> 1:40:31.620\n Then the day after Travis fights,\n\n1:40:31.620 --> 1:40:34.180\n Kayla Harrison goes and wins her first gold medal, right?\n\n1:40:34.180 --> 1:40:35.020\n Our first ever gold.\n\n1:40:35.020 --> 1:40:36.380\n So we have a gold and a bronze.\n\n1:40:36.380 --> 1:40:38.460\n His training partner wins a gold.\n\n1:40:38.460 --> 1:40:41.220\n His best friend from growing up wins a bronze.\n\n1:40:41.220 --> 1:40:42.860\n He has nothing, right?\n\n1:40:42.860 --> 1:40:46.980\n To see him for four years go through hell,\n\n1:40:46.980 --> 1:40:49.580\n like literally like all of his injuries,\n\n1:40:49.580 --> 1:40:50.980\n every training camp,\n\n1:40:50.980 --> 1:40:52.500\n and then forget the humiliation,\n\n1:40:52.500 --> 1:40:56.540\n because every time any reporter ever came to my dojo,\n\n1:40:56.540 --> 1:40:57.620\n they want to talk to Kayla.\n\n1:40:57.620 --> 1:40:59.100\n She's the Olympic champion.\n\n1:40:59.100 --> 1:41:00.940\n Who's this Travis guy?\n\n1:41:00.940 --> 1:41:01.980\n Who is this guy?\n\n1:41:01.980 --> 1:41:04.180\n So he didn't medal.\n\n1:41:04.180 --> 1:41:05.300\n He's not that important.\n\n1:41:05.300 --> 1:41:08.780\n And up until you get to right before the Olympics,\n\n1:41:08.780 --> 1:41:11.660\n now they talk about he's an Olympian again.\n\n1:41:11.660 --> 1:41:12.740\n But up until that point,\n\n1:41:12.740 --> 1:41:16.460\n and then every little kid sees Kayla's medal.\n\n1:41:16.460 --> 1:41:18.740\n Oh, Travis, yeah, you went to the Olympics.\n\n1:41:18.740 --> 1:41:19.580\n Where's your medal?\n\n1:41:19.580 --> 1:41:20.500\n How did you do?\n\n1:41:20.500 --> 1:41:22.860\n You know, I took fifth, I didn't place.\n\n1:41:22.860 --> 1:41:25.020\n You know, it's the lowest of low,\n\n1:41:25.020 --> 1:41:27.380\n every day having that constant reminder.\n\n1:41:27.380 --> 1:41:31.700\n So four years later, when that guy,\n\n1:41:31.700 --> 1:41:35.540\n I mean, mentally, he was ready.\n\n1:41:35.540 --> 1:41:37.900\n Physically, he was ready.\n\n1:41:37.900 --> 1:41:41.780\n That was the best and strongest Travis Stevens\n\n1:41:41.780 --> 1:41:43.980\n that I've ever seen and I've ever felt.\n\n1:41:43.980 --> 1:41:45.380\n Like, cause I had to get on the mat\n\n1:41:45.380 --> 1:41:47.060\n and do some drills and stuff like that,\n\n1:41:47.060 --> 1:41:48.660\n and like try to defend armbars,\n\n1:41:48.660 --> 1:41:51.300\n and cause we didn't have a lot of bodies in Rio.\n\n1:41:51.300 --> 1:41:53.100\n And I was like, my God, he's,\n\n1:41:53.100 --> 1:41:54.260\n I said after one of the prizes,\n\n1:41:54.260 --> 1:41:56.580\n those are the strongest I've ever felt that guy, right?\n\n1:41:56.580 --> 1:41:59.100\n Before the competition, so physically he was ready.\n\n1:41:59.100 --> 1:42:00.940\n Mentally, the morning of competition,\n\n1:42:00.940 --> 1:42:03.580\n I said to Travis, I looked him in the eye,\n\n1:42:03.580 --> 1:42:06.340\n and I said, you know, we're ready to go over to the venue.\n\n1:42:06.340 --> 1:42:07.940\n I said, are you ready today?\n\n1:42:07.940 --> 1:42:10.340\n And he just looked at me like he goes,\n\n1:42:10.340 --> 1:42:12.420\n I am gonna shock the world today.\n\n1:42:12.420 --> 1:42:14.060\n That's what he told me, I'm gonna shock the world today.\n\n1:42:14.060 --> 1:42:16.900\n And I said, all right, great, let's go, right?\n\n1:42:16.900 --> 1:42:18.580\n So we go to the venue,\n\n1:42:18.580 --> 1:42:23.140\n and every other athlete was just like nervously,\n\n1:42:23.140 --> 1:42:25.300\n like doing repetitions of Uchi Komis.\n\n1:42:25.300 --> 1:42:27.060\n You could see like sweat coming out.\n\n1:42:27.060 --> 1:42:29.780\n You could see like all this nervous energy\n\n1:42:29.780 --> 1:42:31.580\n going through their body.\n\n1:42:31.580 --> 1:42:32.820\n And here comes Travis Stevens.\n\n1:42:32.820 --> 1:42:35.460\n He's got these big goofy headphones on.\n\n1:42:35.460 --> 1:42:38.220\n He's got a tank top that says USA on it.\n\n1:42:38.220 --> 1:42:41.260\n He's got the swim trunks that say USA,\n\n1:42:41.260 --> 1:42:44.300\n like that have shiny letters that glow in the dark.\n\n1:42:44.300 --> 1:42:47.580\n And he's like, and this is in the middle of the judo hall\n\n1:42:47.580 --> 1:42:48.780\n where all these athletes are warming up\n\n1:42:48.780 --> 1:42:50.060\n for their first match.\n\n1:42:50.060 --> 1:42:53.260\n He's like dancing around, like doing this loose warmup,\n\n1:42:53.260 --> 1:42:56.780\n like almost like a little kid at an amusement park\n\n1:42:56.780 --> 1:42:59.540\n whose dad said, yeah, go play, you know?\n\n1:42:59.540 --> 1:43:01.900\n And it was like, he had waited four years for that moment,\n\n1:43:01.900 --> 1:43:05.700\n and he was so relaxed, so focused, so relaxed,\n\n1:43:05.700 --> 1:43:07.380\n and couldn't wait.\n\n1:43:07.380 --> 1:43:08.700\n It was like a caged tiger.\n\n1:43:08.700 --> 1:43:10.700\n Like if you like coming out of the chute\n\n1:43:10.700 --> 1:43:14.820\n to go step on to the mat was like this tiger\n\n1:43:14.820 --> 1:43:16.300\n that you were just letting out of the cage,\n\n1:43:16.300 --> 1:43:18.660\n and he just go, like now's your time to go fight.\n\n1:43:18.660 --> 1:43:20.420\n And that's what he did that whole day.\n\n1:43:20.420 --> 1:43:25.140\n And like when he beat Chirikishvili in the semis\n\n1:43:25.140 --> 1:43:27.860\n and choked him out and won that fight,\n\n1:43:27.860 --> 1:43:30.780\n like there's nobody with the exception\n\n1:43:30.780 --> 1:43:33.340\n of maybe the guys in the American team,\n\n1:43:33.340 --> 1:43:35.660\n there was nobody in that stadium\n\n1:43:35.660 --> 1:43:38.420\n that expected Travis to beat him, nobody.\n\n1:43:38.420 --> 1:43:41.580\n Like, you know, he had smashed Travis,\n\n1:43:41.580 --> 1:43:43.460\n I don't know how many times before that free poem,\n\n1:43:43.460 --> 1:43:44.620\n like in the first minute even.\n\n1:43:44.620 --> 1:43:46.020\n It wasn't even a fight, right?\n\n1:43:46.020 --> 1:43:49.140\n And it was great game plan.\n\n1:43:49.140 --> 1:43:51.740\n He's the world number one at the time too.\n\n1:43:52.820 --> 1:43:56.860\n World number one at the time, world champion,\n\n1:43:56.860 --> 1:43:59.940\n carried the flag for the Georgian Federation\n\n1:43:59.940 --> 1:44:01.460\n walking into the games,\n\n1:44:02.740 --> 1:44:06.340\n most dominant 81 kilo player in that weight class\n\n1:44:06.340 --> 1:44:08.220\n for quite some time.\n\n1:44:08.220 --> 1:44:13.220\n And man, we just had his number and Travis was ready to go.\n\n1:44:13.220 --> 1:44:14.060\n It was so cool.\n\n1:44:14.060 --> 1:44:15.740\n It was so awesome.\n\n1:44:15.740 --> 1:44:17.340\n I mean, we had already won,\n\n1:44:17.340 --> 1:44:20.220\n Kayla had already won her second gold, right?\n\n1:44:20.220 --> 1:44:24.340\n The way the event went and Travis winning that\n\n1:44:24.340 --> 1:44:26.340\n was like icing on the cake for our team.\n\n1:44:26.340 --> 1:44:29.220\n That was the best performance we've ever had in history.\n\n1:44:29.220 --> 1:44:30.060\n It's awesome.\n\n1:44:30.060 --> 1:44:31.620\n So you mentioned Kayla.\n\n1:44:31.620 --> 1:44:36.060\n She is one of, if not the greatest American Jidoka ever.\n\n1:44:36.940 --> 1:44:39.540\n Two time gold medalist.\n\n1:44:39.540 --> 1:44:41.980\n 2010 world champion.\n\n1:44:41.980 --> 1:44:42.820\n 2010.\n\n1:44:42.820 --> 1:44:43.860\n First senior worlds.\n\n1:44:43.860 --> 1:44:45.580\n Senior worlds.\n\n1:44:45.580 --> 1:44:49.220\n What makes Kayla special?\n\n1:44:49.220 --> 1:44:51.420\n What makes her so great?\n\n1:44:51.420 --> 1:44:53.300\n What made this champion?\n\n1:44:53.300 --> 1:44:57.420\n It's a combination of a lot of things.\n\n1:44:57.420 --> 1:45:01.180\n One was obviously Kayla's mental toughness, right?\n\n1:45:01.180 --> 1:45:03.860\n To overcome what she overcame.\n\n1:45:03.860 --> 1:45:05.740\n You know, this is a girl who,\n\n1:45:06.940 --> 1:45:10.300\n you know, let's not say forget about the sexual abuse,\n\n1:45:10.300 --> 1:45:13.260\n but the fact that she had to go through that in life\n\n1:45:13.260 --> 1:45:15.860\n and learned how to compartmentalize that\n\n1:45:15.860 --> 1:45:18.420\n and keep that off as a separate part of her brain,\n\n1:45:18.420 --> 1:45:21.060\n you know, and forget about it and move on.\n\n1:45:21.060 --> 1:45:23.700\n That took an incredible team to help her do that,\n\n1:45:23.700 --> 1:45:28.180\n and my dad was a huge part of her accomplishing that.\n\n1:45:28.180 --> 1:45:30.860\n So for people who don't know, we should comment\n\n1:45:30.860 --> 1:45:33.980\n and say that Kayla had to go through trauma\n\n1:45:33.980 --> 1:45:37.420\n in her earlier life through sexual abuse\n\n1:45:37.420 --> 1:45:39.700\n and had to overcome that through the whole process\n\n1:45:39.700 --> 1:45:43.220\n of becoming a champion as well.\n\n1:45:43.220 --> 1:45:45.940\n Because she had zero self esteem, zero self worth.\n\n1:45:45.940 --> 1:45:47.420\n She was at the lowest of lows\n\n1:45:47.420 --> 1:45:51.580\n and didn't even want to be on this earth, right?\n\n1:45:51.580 --> 1:45:55.100\n So she was traumatized obviously\n\n1:45:56.180 --> 1:45:57.460\n and getting her the right help\n\n1:45:57.460 --> 1:45:59.060\n and surrounding her with the right people\n\n1:45:59.060 --> 1:46:01.460\n who could help her get through that\n\n1:46:01.460 --> 1:46:05.020\n and be by her side as she's getting through that\n\n1:46:05.020 --> 1:46:06.780\n and letting her know and reaffirming\n\n1:46:06.780 --> 1:46:08.380\n that she's doing the right thing\n\n1:46:08.380 --> 1:46:09.780\n and she made the right decision\n\n1:46:09.780 --> 1:46:11.780\n and she should have zero guilt.\n\n1:46:11.780 --> 1:46:14.060\n And you know, this doesn't define her.\n\n1:46:14.060 --> 1:46:15.820\n It happened to her, but it doesn't define her.\n\n1:46:15.820 --> 1:46:18.580\n What defines her is what she does from now on.\n\n1:46:18.580 --> 1:46:21.580\n And then rebuilding that person to become who she became.\n\n1:46:21.580 --> 1:46:25.340\n I think the mental toughness is a big part of it, her mind.\n\n1:46:26.700 --> 1:46:31.700\n But then as an athlete, she's a lot like Travis.\n\n1:46:32.540 --> 1:46:34.060\n She's a warrior.\n\n1:46:34.060 --> 1:46:35.020\n She's a fighter.\n\n1:46:35.020 --> 1:46:37.180\n My dad always jokes with her.\n\n1:46:37.180 --> 1:46:39.260\n He says, you're a workhorse.\n\n1:46:39.260 --> 1:46:40.180\n You're not a thoroughbred.\n\n1:46:40.180 --> 1:46:42.460\n We're not gonna treat you like a thoroughbred, right?\n\n1:46:42.460 --> 1:46:45.220\n You're a workhorse, so you're gonna work.\n\n1:46:45.220 --> 1:46:46.860\n And the way you're gonna get bigger and stronger\n\n1:46:46.860 --> 1:46:48.580\n is you're gonna work harder and you're gonna keep, you know.\n\n1:46:48.580 --> 1:46:50.820\n And she came to us when she was only 15.\n\n1:46:50.820 --> 1:46:53.020\n So at that time we got her\n\n1:46:53.020 --> 1:46:55.260\n with a really good strength and conditioning coach.\n\n1:46:55.260 --> 1:46:57.700\n We did all the core Olympic style lifting.\n\n1:46:57.700 --> 1:47:00.340\n Like as her body was developing,\n\n1:47:00.340 --> 1:47:02.340\n she was getting stronger every single day.\n\n1:47:02.340 --> 1:47:04.300\n And then, you know, she had the luxury\n\n1:47:04.300 --> 1:47:06.260\n of being on the mat with,\n\n1:47:06.260 --> 1:47:08.380\n at the time I was still young enough to train\n\n1:47:08.380 --> 1:47:10.460\n and be on the mat and I was around her weight class\n\n1:47:10.460 --> 1:47:12.100\n and Travis was able to train with her\n\n1:47:12.100 --> 1:47:15.540\n and we had all the top US athletes at the time\n\n1:47:15.540 --> 1:47:16.700\n training here at my school.\n\n1:47:16.700 --> 1:47:19.140\n So she got the benefit of all the best guys\n\n1:47:19.140 --> 1:47:21.060\n to train within the country, you know.\n\n1:47:21.060 --> 1:47:24.260\n And her doing all of those rounds,\n\n1:47:24.260 --> 1:47:26.340\n you know, night in, week, night,\n\n1:47:26.340 --> 1:47:28.700\n every night, every week, every year,\n\n1:47:28.700 --> 1:47:30.300\n compiled with the best, you know,\n\n1:47:30.300 --> 1:47:32.700\n highest level she could as a girl.\n\n1:47:32.700 --> 1:47:34.420\n She got the strength, she got the technique,\n\n1:47:34.420 --> 1:47:36.660\n she got the, and then she had the coaching on top of it\n\n1:47:36.660 --> 1:47:38.340\n with my dad being on her as, you know,\n\n1:47:38.340 --> 1:47:42.060\n working her out and, you know, having the wherewithal\n\n1:47:42.060 --> 1:47:44.180\n to develop a strategy and a plan for her.\n\n1:47:44.180 --> 1:47:46.260\n Because when she first came here,\n\n1:47:46.260 --> 1:47:50.260\n she competed at 63 kilos, which is 138 pounds.\n\n1:47:51.380 --> 1:47:55.060\n At the time, Rhonda Rousey was also training here\n\n1:47:55.060 --> 1:47:56.940\n and she was 70 kilos.\n\n1:47:56.940 --> 1:48:00.260\n So if Kayla was struggling making 63,\n\n1:48:00.260 --> 1:48:01.820\n so the only way to, obviously,\n\n1:48:01.820 --> 1:48:04.220\n the only way to still compete is to move up.\n\n1:48:04.220 --> 1:48:05.780\n But my dad said, well, if you move up,\n\n1:48:05.780 --> 1:48:06.940\n then you're in Rhonda's weight.\n\n1:48:06.940 --> 1:48:09.580\n So let's skip that weight and you're gonna go to 78 kilos.\n\n1:48:09.580 --> 1:48:12.500\n And he told her, listen, you're gonna go up two weight classes.\n\n1:48:12.500 --> 1:48:15.380\n She looked at him and was like, that's 172 pounds.\n\n1:48:15.380 --> 1:48:17.220\n And he goes, well, I don't care.\n\n1:48:17.220 --> 1:48:19.460\n Like, you're already struggling making 138,\n\n1:48:19.460 --> 1:48:20.980\n you weigh 150, what's the difference?\n\n1:48:20.980 --> 1:48:23.220\n We put 20 pounds on, go to 170.\n\n1:48:23.220 --> 1:48:24.980\n So that's why she jumped two weights,\n\n1:48:24.980 --> 1:48:27.500\n because she passed Rhonda, she went to the weight above\n\n1:48:27.500 --> 1:48:29.100\n so she could make the national team\n\n1:48:29.100 --> 1:48:30.740\n and she had a chance to go to the Olympics\n\n1:48:30.740 --> 1:48:33.020\n and all that, because we envisioned Rhonda\n\n1:48:33.020 --> 1:48:34.980\n staying around till 2012.\n\n1:48:34.980 --> 1:48:37.300\n And that's also like a longterm vision\n\n1:48:37.300 --> 1:48:40.340\n because you kind of grow into that body then over time.\n\n1:48:40.340 --> 1:48:41.180\n Correct.\n\n1:48:41.180 --> 1:48:42.500\n So you can dominate, you can learn\n\n1:48:42.500 --> 1:48:43.900\n what it's like in that weight class.\n\n1:48:43.900 --> 1:48:46.020\n You can learn to dominate that weight class,\n\n1:48:46.020 --> 1:48:47.700\n excel and then dominate.\n\n1:48:47.700 --> 1:48:49.980\n People that cut weight too hard, too long,\n\n1:48:49.980 --> 1:48:51.260\n they forget about technique\n\n1:48:51.260 --> 1:48:52.940\n because they're only worried about losing weight.\n\n1:48:52.940 --> 1:48:54.500\n They're always tired in training.\n\n1:48:54.500 --> 1:48:57.340\n They don't give 100% effort, they're not getting better.\n\n1:48:57.340 --> 1:49:00.500\n She now is just focused on getting better at judo,\n\n1:49:00.500 --> 1:49:02.660\n getting bigger, getting stronger, getting more powerful.\n\n1:49:02.660 --> 1:49:05.420\n So I think giving her that purpose and that,\n\n1:49:05.420 --> 1:49:06.540\n that was a great call.\n\n1:49:07.700 --> 1:49:11.900\n What are some memorable or maybe the most memorable moment,\n\n1:49:11.900 --> 1:49:14.740\n Kayla Harrison moment to you as her coach?\n\n1:49:16.860 --> 1:49:19.340\n Not the most perhaps, let's say,\n\n1:49:19.340 --> 1:49:21.140\n what are some memorable moments?\n\n1:49:22.220 --> 1:49:23.620\n Everybody hears the good ones, right?\n\n1:49:23.620 --> 1:49:26.220\n So everybody knows she won the world championships\n\n1:49:26.220 --> 1:49:28.740\n in Tokyo in 2010.\n\n1:49:28.740 --> 1:49:31.900\n She was our two time Olympic champion in 2012, 2016.\n\n1:49:31.900 --> 1:49:34.140\n I'll never forget those moments, right?\n\n1:49:34.140 --> 1:49:35.420\n Cause they're historic.\n\n1:49:36.660 --> 1:49:40.460\n One of the biggest moments that I liked sharing this story\n\n1:49:40.460 --> 1:49:45.460\n with everybody is that in 2010 in January,\n\n1:49:45.860 --> 1:49:48.020\n Kayla was still a developing athlete\n\n1:49:48.020 --> 1:49:50.220\n and we had a local tournament in New York.\n\n1:49:50.220 --> 1:49:53.580\n It was in Brooklyn, New York, it was called the Starrett Cup.\n\n1:49:53.580 --> 1:49:55.180\n And I knew that at that tournament\n\n1:49:55.180 --> 1:49:57.180\n that two of the Canadian girls,\n\n1:49:57.180 --> 1:49:59.740\n they were like ranked 15th or 20th in the world.\n\n1:49:59.740 --> 1:50:02.540\n They weren't superstars, but they were tough players.\n\n1:50:02.540 --> 1:50:04.780\n Both of them, I knew were gonna be at that tournament.\n\n1:50:04.780 --> 1:50:07.100\n So I said, Kayla, we're gonna go to this tournament,\n\n1:50:07.100 --> 1:50:08.620\n you're gonna compete against the Canadian girls,\n\n1:50:08.620 --> 1:50:10.140\n get some good experience,\n\n1:50:10.140 --> 1:50:11.300\n figure out what you need to work on\n\n1:50:11.300 --> 1:50:13.820\n and then we'll go home and work on some stuff.\n\n1:50:13.820 --> 1:50:14.940\n Well, she went to the tournament,\n\n1:50:14.940 --> 1:50:16.540\n there was only three girls in the weight,\n\n1:50:16.540 --> 1:50:18.420\n her and the two Canadians.\n\n1:50:18.420 --> 1:50:22.740\n At that tournament, she lost both fights, right?\n\n1:50:22.740 --> 1:50:26.340\n So this is January, 2010, she lost both matches.\n\n1:50:26.340 --> 1:50:27.260\n She was competitive,\n\n1:50:27.260 --> 1:50:29.420\n but certainly things she needed to work on,\n\n1:50:29.420 --> 1:50:32.540\n it was good development thing for her and for us.\n\n1:50:32.540 --> 1:50:34.940\n It also opened her mind to say, oh man,\n\n1:50:34.940 --> 1:50:39.540\n cause she was already a junior world champion at the time.\n\n1:50:39.540 --> 1:50:40.940\n But so now there's another level,\n\n1:50:40.940 --> 1:50:42.180\n this is a senior level, right?\n\n1:50:42.180 --> 1:50:43.420\n You gotta go up another level.\n\n1:50:43.420 --> 1:50:45.500\n Here's two girls that aren't even medalists\n\n1:50:45.500 --> 1:50:46.340\n that are beating you.\n\n1:50:46.340 --> 1:50:48.140\n So now there's more work to be done.\n\n1:50:48.140 --> 1:50:49.580\n And so I like telling that story\n\n1:50:49.580 --> 1:50:53.500\n because everybody sees the champions in the greatest moments,\n\n1:50:53.500 --> 1:50:55.620\n they don't see them when they have bad days.\n\n1:50:55.620 --> 1:50:58.740\n And could you imagine being, oh and two,\n\n1:50:58.740 --> 1:51:01.620\n you feel like a failure, right?\n\n1:51:01.620 --> 1:51:06.620\n But 10 months later, it was Tokyo 2010,\n\n1:51:06.780 --> 1:51:09.660\n she went from oh and two at Starret, New York\n\n1:51:10.940 --> 1:51:15.940\n to world champion 2010 in the motherland in Japan.\n\n1:51:16.860 --> 1:51:19.420\n I mean, that's an amazing turnaround.\n\n1:51:19.420 --> 1:51:22.540\n And that's only possible if you put the losses\n\n1:51:22.540 --> 1:51:24.340\n in their proper context,\n\n1:51:24.340 --> 1:51:26.580\n you don't let it destroy you mentally\n\n1:51:26.580 --> 1:51:28.100\n and just keep moving forward.\n\n1:51:28.100 --> 1:51:29.460\n Correct.\n\n1:51:29.460 --> 1:51:31.100\n This is so funny.\n\n1:51:31.100 --> 1:51:34.380\n So you were there 2010 at the Starret Cup?\n\n1:51:34.380 --> 1:51:35.980\n Was Travis there?\n\n1:51:35.980 --> 1:51:36.820\n Yeah.\n\n1:51:36.820 --> 1:51:38.900\n I made all those, we fought at every,\n\n1:51:38.900 --> 1:51:41.540\n like the mentality of our team was\n\n1:51:41.540 --> 1:51:43.820\n no tournament is beneath us.\n\n1:51:43.820 --> 1:51:47.900\n If our goal is to go to the Olympics in the world and win,\n\n1:51:47.900 --> 1:51:49.580\n there's no tournament that's beneath us.\n\n1:51:49.580 --> 1:51:51.820\n We're gonna get experience, we're gonna fight,\n\n1:51:51.820 --> 1:51:54.020\n we're gonna learn, we're gonna compete,\n\n1:51:54.020 --> 1:51:56.380\n we're gonna get better, you know?\n\n1:51:56.380 --> 1:51:59.980\n I actually, just as a funny little side,\n\n1:51:59.980 --> 1:52:01.860\n I was there, I competed.\n\n1:52:01.860 --> 1:52:02.700\n Really?\n\n1:52:02.700 --> 1:52:04.140\n This is one of the earlier tournaments,\n\n1:52:04.140 --> 1:52:05.460\n like the beginner division.\n\n1:52:05.460 --> 1:52:07.700\n Oh no, I actually did black belt division too.\n\n1:52:07.700 --> 1:52:11.780\n That was one of the, actually yeah, I remember that.\n\n1:52:11.780 --> 1:52:15.140\n That's when it was so early that I thought,\n\n1:52:16.540 --> 1:52:18.980\n like I was also really strong at that time,\n\n1:52:18.980 --> 1:52:21.100\n just like physically like power lifting stuff.\n\n1:52:21.100 --> 1:52:24.260\n So I thought like it'll be good experience\n\n1:52:24.260 --> 1:52:26.620\n to also do black belt division.\n\n1:52:26.620 --> 1:52:28.620\n And remember, it must have been actually\n\n1:52:28.620 --> 1:52:30.380\n Travis's division, which is funny.\n\n1:52:32.540 --> 1:52:33.700\n Is Legere Brothers?\n\n1:52:33.700 --> 1:52:35.500\n Yeah, Harry and Gary.\n\n1:52:35.500 --> 1:52:37.580\n They are super, they're super good\n\n1:52:37.580 --> 1:52:38.700\n and they're super dominant,\n\n1:52:38.700 --> 1:52:42.460\n but I think Travis faced one of them and beat them.\n\n1:52:43.740 --> 1:52:45.380\n I don't know, I just remembered,\n\n1:52:46.420 --> 1:52:48.620\n it's funny how there's just like these little roads\n\n1:52:48.620 --> 1:52:51.340\n that later reconnect.\n\n1:52:51.340 --> 1:52:54.420\n But yeah, there's some incredible people there.\n\n1:52:54.420 --> 1:52:57.460\n And I saw obviously the positive things\n\n1:52:57.460 --> 1:52:59.860\n and it's interesting that Kayla's story\n\n1:52:59.860 --> 1:53:01.380\n was also intersecting there\n\n1:53:01.380 --> 1:53:03.620\n and that was one of the lower points for her.\n\n1:53:04.540 --> 1:53:06.940\n Another story I like to share is that\n\n1:53:08.100 --> 1:53:09.940\n you have to know your athletes, right?\n\n1:53:09.940 --> 1:53:12.180\n And you have to really get to know their,\n\n1:53:13.380 --> 1:53:15.420\n what they're thinking psychologically, mentally,\n\n1:53:15.420 --> 1:53:16.540\n what's going through their head.\n\n1:53:16.540 --> 1:53:20.020\n Another story was in Tokyo.\n\n1:53:20.020 --> 1:53:25.020\n It was 2015, the Tokyo Grand Slam.\n\n1:53:25.460 --> 1:53:28.140\n So we had had Kayla face off\n\n1:53:28.140 --> 1:53:30.900\n against almost all the top girls in her division.\n\n1:53:30.900 --> 1:53:34.100\n She had beaten everybody going into the 2016 Olympics.\n\n1:53:34.100 --> 1:53:37.620\n But at the 2015 Tokyo Grand Slam,\n\n1:53:39.020 --> 1:53:40.660\n there was a girl from Japan\n\n1:53:40.660 --> 1:53:42.220\n that she hadn't fought in a long time\n\n1:53:42.220 --> 1:53:44.380\n and she lost to the girl last time she fought her.\n\n1:53:44.380 --> 1:53:46.460\n So it was something we wanted her\n\n1:53:46.460 --> 1:53:48.540\n to beat this girl going into the Olympics\n\n1:53:48.540 --> 1:53:50.580\n so that she knew she could beat everybody.\n\n1:53:52.300 --> 1:53:54.660\n And it was a first round match\n\n1:53:54.660 --> 1:53:57.940\n and it was gonna be tough for Kayla, right?\n\n1:53:57.940 --> 1:53:59.180\n It was gonna be a really hard fight.\n\n1:53:59.180 --> 1:54:02.540\n And she had won a bunch of tournaments in a row\n\n1:54:02.540 --> 1:54:03.380\n leading up to that.\n\n1:54:03.380 --> 1:54:06.620\n So her confidence was really high, but at the same time,\n\n1:54:06.620 --> 1:54:08.740\n she didn't think she needed this fight.\n\n1:54:10.500 --> 1:54:13.860\n And she showed up to the tournament and she said,\n\n1:54:13.860 --> 1:54:15.500\n I don't think I can fight today.\n\n1:54:15.500 --> 1:54:17.260\n I've got a stinger in my neck.\n\n1:54:17.260 --> 1:54:19.660\n I've got a stinger coming down my neck and I'm kind of sore.\n\n1:54:19.660 --> 1:54:21.740\n And she didn't tell us.\n\n1:54:21.740 --> 1:54:23.380\n She went and told the trainer.\n\n1:54:23.380 --> 1:54:25.740\n She walked around, she's holding her neck.\n\n1:54:25.740 --> 1:54:27.780\n And me and my dad were like, what's up with her?\n\n1:54:27.780 --> 1:54:28.620\n I don't know.\n\n1:54:28.620 --> 1:54:32.540\n And then, so maybe she doesn't wanna fight today.\n\n1:54:32.540 --> 1:54:33.380\n I don't know, right?\n\n1:54:33.380 --> 1:54:35.940\n So all of a sudden the trainer comes up to us\n\n1:54:35.940 --> 1:54:37.020\n and she didn't come to us.\n\n1:54:37.020 --> 1:54:37.940\n The trainer came to us and says,\n\n1:54:37.940 --> 1:54:39.780\n you know, I really don't think it's a good idea\n\n1:54:39.780 --> 1:54:41.580\n that Kayla fight today.\n\n1:54:41.580 --> 1:54:43.700\n And we looked at him and we're like,\n\n1:54:43.700 --> 1:54:45.740\n well, your opinion doesn't really matter, does it?\n\n1:54:45.740 --> 1:54:46.580\n Right?\n\n1:54:46.580 --> 1:54:47.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:54:47.420 --> 1:54:48.260\n What's up with her?\n\n1:54:48.260 --> 1:54:49.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:54:49.100 --> 1:54:49.940\n Well, she has this thing in her neck.\n\n1:54:49.940 --> 1:54:52.380\n It's like a pinched nerve and there's this and that.\n\n1:54:53.380 --> 1:54:56.980\n We talked, I said, is there a risk of her getting injured?\n\n1:54:56.980 --> 1:54:58.660\n Like, is this pain or is this risk\n\n1:54:58.660 --> 1:55:00.620\n that she's gonna get injured and she's gonna set her back\n\n1:55:00.620 --> 1:55:02.740\n like long time in her career?\n\n1:55:02.740 --> 1:55:04.420\n Says, no, she's not gonna get injured.\n\n1:55:04.420 --> 1:55:05.260\n It's just a pinched nerve.\n\n1:55:05.260 --> 1:55:06.500\n It's a little pain she's gonna have to deal with.\n\n1:55:06.500 --> 1:55:08.660\n I go, okay, well, can you fix the pain?\n\n1:55:09.700 --> 1:55:11.500\n Says, yeah, I can do this and that\n\n1:55:11.500 --> 1:55:13.700\n and I can give her a shot and the pain will go away.\n\n1:55:13.700 --> 1:55:15.580\n I said, okay, then do that.\n\n1:55:15.580 --> 1:55:17.220\n And so Kayla comes up, she goes,\n\n1:55:17.220 --> 1:55:18.900\n didn't the trainer talk to you?\n\n1:55:18.900 --> 1:55:20.220\n I said, yeah, he talked to us.\n\n1:55:20.220 --> 1:55:22.140\n Well, he said, I can't fight.\n\n1:55:22.140 --> 1:55:24.140\n I know, but we already talked to the trainer and.\n\n1:55:24.140 --> 1:55:26.100\n I love it.\n\n1:55:26.100 --> 1:55:27.700\n He said, you're good to go.\n\n1:55:27.700 --> 1:55:29.340\n She looked at us like.\n\n1:55:29.340 --> 1:55:31.740\n And then we had to talk to her and say, listen,\n\n1:55:31.740 --> 1:55:34.180\n you're not injured, you're in pain\n\n1:55:34.180 --> 1:55:35.460\n because we just came from a camp.\n\n1:55:35.460 --> 1:55:38.020\n I said, you're in pain, but here's the deal.\n\n1:55:38.020 --> 1:55:39.380\n We want you to fight this girl.\n\n1:55:39.380 --> 1:55:41.220\n We want you to go out there and beat this girl, period.\n\n1:55:41.220 --> 1:55:42.060\n I don't care.\n\n1:55:42.060 --> 1:55:43.540\n I want to know that you can beat this girl.\n\n1:55:43.540 --> 1:55:44.580\n This is why we came.\n\n1:55:44.580 --> 1:55:48.300\n This is our last hard tournament before the Olympic games.\n\n1:55:48.300 --> 1:55:50.420\n This is what we want from you.\n\n1:55:50.420 --> 1:55:53.380\n And lo and behold, she understood.\n\n1:55:53.380 --> 1:55:54.780\n They gave her a quick shot.\n\n1:55:54.780 --> 1:55:56.540\n The rest of the world thought we were crazy\n\n1:55:56.540 --> 1:55:58.660\n making her compete.\n\n1:55:58.660 --> 1:56:01.740\n And then she went out there, she fought,\n\n1:56:01.740 --> 1:56:03.100\n didn't even know she was injured.\n\n1:56:03.100 --> 1:56:04.020\n No, you know what I mean?\n\n1:56:04.020 --> 1:56:06.020\n She just went out there, she fought the tournament.\n\n1:56:06.020 --> 1:56:07.380\n She beat the Japanese girl.\n\n1:56:07.380 --> 1:56:09.700\n She ended up going through the whole tournament.\n\n1:56:09.700 --> 1:56:11.500\n She took a gold medal.\n\n1:56:11.500 --> 1:56:12.460\n She won the event.\n\n1:56:12.460 --> 1:56:13.900\n Mm hmm.\n\n1:56:13.900 --> 1:56:17.740\n That turned out to be a great confidence builder, yeah.\n\n1:56:18.780 --> 1:56:21.420\n And that kind of sets you up for all the chaos\n\n1:56:21.420 --> 1:56:23.140\n that can happen at the Olympic games.\n\n1:56:23.140 --> 1:56:25.980\n And it tells you if you can beat these girls\n\n1:56:25.980 --> 1:56:28.460\n when you're not 100% and you're not at your best,\n\n1:56:28.460 --> 1:56:31.780\n you're physically beat, mentally beat,\n\n1:56:31.780 --> 1:56:33.340\n imagine what you're gonna do when you're fresh.\n\n1:56:33.340 --> 1:56:35.060\n Well, when she was going to the Olympic games,\n\n1:56:35.060 --> 1:56:35.980\n there's a lot.\n\n1:56:35.980 --> 1:56:38.260\n She had the mental game down.\n\n1:56:38.260 --> 1:56:39.100\n Down.\n\n1:56:39.100 --> 1:56:39.940\n Down.\n\n1:56:39.940 --> 1:56:40.860\n There wasn't a girl in that division\n\n1:56:40.860 --> 1:56:41.940\n that thought they could beat Kayla\n\n1:56:41.940 --> 1:56:43.060\n going into those games.\n\n1:56:43.060 --> 1:56:44.380\n Not a one.\n\n1:56:44.380 --> 1:56:46.580\n They just looked at her and went, no, not happening.\n\n1:56:46.580 --> 1:56:48.060\n Yeah, that's great.\n\n1:56:48.060 --> 1:56:50.060\n I mean, she's a great Olympic champion,\n\n1:56:50.060 --> 1:56:51.620\n two time Olympic champion.\n\n1:56:51.620 --> 1:56:55.700\n But there is something that she's commented on,\n\n1:56:55.700 --> 1:57:00.100\n which is she's suffered or went through depression\n\n1:57:00.100 --> 1:57:02.460\n after winning her second Olympic gold.\n\n1:57:02.460 --> 1:57:04.140\n Why do you think this happens?\n\n1:57:04.140 --> 1:57:07.780\n You often hear stories of great champions\n\n1:57:07.780 --> 1:57:11.020\n becoming depressed after the Olympics.\n\n1:57:11.020 --> 1:57:14.340\n There's a lack of purpose afterwards, right?\n\n1:57:14.340 --> 1:57:18.460\n Because you've done in life what you set out to do.\n\n1:57:18.460 --> 1:57:20.540\n You've had a goal every day you woke up.\n\n1:57:20.540 --> 1:57:21.900\n You knew what your purpose was.\n\n1:57:21.900 --> 1:57:25.860\n You knew what your day looked like.\n\n1:57:25.860 --> 1:57:27.900\n You knew why you were doing that.\n\n1:57:27.900 --> 1:57:31.620\n And all of a sudden you won and you got all the fame\n\n1:57:31.620 --> 1:57:33.780\n and you're all happy.\n\n1:57:33.780 --> 1:57:37.860\n But then you wake up and you go, now what?\n\n1:57:37.860 --> 1:57:39.420\n I don't have a next.\n\n1:57:39.420 --> 1:57:42.100\n And also because there was nothing for her,\n\n1:57:42.100 --> 1:57:46.500\n there was no path set out for Kayla that said,\n\n1:57:46.500 --> 1:57:49.100\n okay, you're gonna become an ambassador,\n\n1:57:49.100 --> 1:57:51.780\n a global ambassador of judo.\n\n1:57:51.780 --> 1:57:54.020\n The IJF is gonna help pay a salary.\n\n1:57:54.020 --> 1:57:56.300\n The USA judo is gonna give you a salary.\n\n1:57:56.300 --> 1:57:58.460\n Here's what we want you to go teach children.\n\n1:57:58.460 --> 1:58:01.020\n We want you to go be an ambassador for women.\n\n1:58:01.020 --> 1:58:03.860\n We're gonna fly you around and whatever it is.\n\n1:58:03.860 --> 1:58:06.460\n We're gonna give you a job and here's what you're gonna do\n\n1:58:06.460 --> 1:58:07.580\n if you'd like to take it.\n\n1:58:07.580 --> 1:58:08.980\n There was nothing for her.\n\n1:58:08.980 --> 1:58:11.420\n Like I remember doing the interview at the Olympics\n\n1:58:11.420 --> 1:58:13.780\n with her and they said, are you gonna compete\n\n1:58:13.780 --> 1:58:14.700\n in the next Olympics?\n\n1:58:14.700 --> 1:58:15.740\n And I said, no.\n\n1:58:15.740 --> 1:58:16.740\n Like why?\n\n1:58:16.740 --> 1:58:17.980\n She already two time gold medalist.\n\n1:58:17.980 --> 1:58:19.820\n What does three time gold medalist do for her?\n\n1:58:19.820 --> 1:58:21.260\n Nothing, right?\n\n1:58:21.260 --> 1:58:23.900\n Doesn't motivate her to do it again.\n\n1:58:23.900 --> 1:58:25.020\n They said, are you doing MMA?\n\n1:58:25.020 --> 1:58:26.500\n I said, no, why would she do MMA?\n\n1:58:26.500 --> 1:58:27.820\n That's ridiculous.\n\n1:58:27.820 --> 1:58:29.300\n Like she doesn't need MMA.\n\n1:58:29.300 --> 1:58:32.500\n She should be able to make a living off of what she's\n\n1:58:32.500 --> 1:58:36.140\n accomplished in this sport for the rest of her life.\n\n1:58:36.140 --> 1:58:39.140\n But what happens is, and what most people don't understand\n\n1:58:39.140 --> 1:58:43.100\n is once you say I'm retired, I'm no longer competing\n\n1:58:43.100 --> 1:58:46.980\n in the sport of judo, you don't get a salary\n\n1:58:46.980 --> 1:58:49.980\n from USA Judo anymore, which she was getting.\n\n1:58:51.100 --> 1:58:53.220\n I think she got like $72,000 a year\n\n1:58:53.220 --> 1:58:55.140\n from USA Judo at the time.\n\n1:58:56.100 --> 1:58:59.900\n You don't get a stipend from the Olympic committee anymore.\n\n1:58:59.900 --> 1:59:01.140\n Goes away.\n\n1:59:01.140 --> 1:59:03.460\n Your sponsor, like the New York Athletic Club\n\n1:59:03.460 --> 1:59:05.700\n was a great sponsor for her for all those years.\n\n1:59:05.700 --> 1:59:08.740\n In fact, she could have never been the athlete she became\n\n1:59:08.740 --> 1:59:10.780\n without the support of the NYC.\n\n1:59:10.780 --> 1:59:12.900\n Cause I talked to them when she was 15, I said,\n\n1:59:12.900 --> 1:59:16.220\n hey, I got a girl that's really good someday.\n\n1:59:16.220 --> 1:59:17.900\n Like if you invest in her now,\n\n1:59:17.900 --> 1:59:20.100\n I promise you she'll pay back for you.\n\n1:59:20.100 --> 1:59:22.380\n And I remember the day she won the Olympic gold,\n\n1:59:22.380 --> 1:59:25.780\n I called the guy up, I said, hey, I told you so.\n\n1:59:25.780 --> 1:59:28.580\n But they can no longer give you stipends\n\n1:59:28.580 --> 1:59:30.860\n because you're not competing and representing them anymore.\n\n1:59:30.860 --> 1:59:32.160\n So that goes away.\n\n1:59:32.160 --> 1:59:35.160\n All of your sponsorships and all of your money\n\n1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:37.360\n that you would make from your TV commercials or whatever,\n\n1:59:37.360 --> 1:59:39.720\n that didn't happen for her after the Olympics\n\n1:59:39.720 --> 1:59:41.720\n cause Judo's a obscure sport, right?\n\n1:59:41.720 --> 1:59:44.760\n So she didn't have any opportunities for that.\n\n1:59:44.760 --> 1:59:47.720\n At the end of the day, she has no revenue coming in.\n\n1:59:47.720 --> 1:59:48.560\n How do you live?\n\n1:59:48.560 --> 1:59:51.280\n You get a bonus of 25 grand from the Olympic committee\n\n1:59:51.280 --> 1:59:53.560\n or whatever for winning a gold.\n\n1:59:53.560 --> 1:59:55.880\n But aside from that, you're not gonna live on that money.\n\n1:59:55.880 --> 1:59:59.000\n So no purpose, no goal, right?\n\n1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:00.560\n What am I gonna wake up and do tomorrow?\n\n2:00:00.560 --> 2:00:02.520\n I don't know, so she has no direction.\n\n2:00:02.520 --> 2:00:05.440\n And then at the same time, she has no money coming in.\n\n2:00:05.440 --> 2:00:06.680\n So everything shuts off.\n\n2:00:06.680 --> 2:00:09.680\n So now it's like, wait till you turn, what do you do?\n\n2:00:10.680 --> 2:00:14.240\n And that leads to being depressed because yeah,\n\n2:00:14.240 --> 2:00:16.560\n even though I've accomplished all this stuff,\n\n2:00:16.560 --> 2:00:17.920\n I'm kind of lost in life.\n\n2:00:17.920 --> 2:00:20.040\n Like what's next for me?\n\n2:00:20.040 --> 2:00:22.320\n And I guess you just have to ride that out\n\n2:00:22.320 --> 2:00:27.320\n because when you're a great human being, great champion,\n\n2:00:27.320 --> 2:00:31.120\n life has a way of helping you find a way.\n\n2:00:31.120 --> 2:00:33.600\n I mean, she's in mixed martial arts now,\n\n2:00:33.600 --> 2:00:35.400\n but she has a lot of stuff going on.\n\n2:00:35.400 --> 2:00:40.080\n Right, well, her kids, she adopted her sister's kids.\n\n2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:41.880\n So she's their legal guardian now.\n\n2:00:41.880 --> 2:00:43.320\n So that is her purpose, right?\n\n2:00:43.320 --> 2:00:46.320\n Raising these kids and making them part of her family.\n\n2:00:46.320 --> 2:00:49.840\n And she's fortunate enough that she has enough money\n\n2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:52.680\n that she can do that and she can give them a good life.\n\n2:00:52.680 --> 2:00:55.200\n Mm hmm, I'm gonna ask you to start some trouble.\n\n2:00:55.200 --> 2:00:57.360\n But I heard that she said somewhere\n\n2:00:57.360 --> 2:01:00.720\n that she can be Khabib Nurmagomedov in judo.\n\n2:01:00.720 --> 2:01:01.960\n What do you think?\n\n2:01:01.960 --> 2:01:03.240\n To be honest with you, I mean,\n\n2:01:03.240 --> 2:01:05.320\n I don't know what level of judoka.\n\n2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:06.160\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:07.000\n I don't know what level he is.\n\n2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:09.720\n But I do know that that Russian system\n\n2:01:09.720 --> 2:01:12.000\n respects judo immensely.\n\n2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:15.200\n What I will tell you is this, I trained with Kayla\n\n2:01:15.200 --> 2:01:18.840\n and I was an Olympic medalist and a world champion in judo.\n\n2:01:18.840 --> 2:01:21.800\n And granted, I was older when I trained with her.\n\n2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:23.600\n But you have to go as a man.\n\n2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:28.280\n You have to go 100% or she will smash you as a man.\n\n2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:30.480\n And I could tell you that if Khabib\n\n2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:34.960\n doesn't do a lot of just judo, doesn't like gripping\n\n2:01:34.960 --> 2:01:38.840\n and doesn't understand, if he can throw, that's one thing.\n\n2:01:38.840 --> 2:01:42.040\n But if he doesn't really understand judo at a high level,\n\n2:01:42.040 --> 2:01:43.720\n she will throw him.\n\n2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:46.080\n She would beat him in a match, in a judo contest.\n\n2:01:46.080 --> 2:01:47.800\n Not in a mixed martial arts contest,\n\n2:01:47.800 --> 2:01:50.880\n not in a wrestling contest, not in a submission contest.\n\n2:01:50.880 --> 2:01:52.840\n In a pure judo match.\n\n2:01:52.840 --> 2:01:56.720\n Where he cannot grab legs and he has to grip up\n\n2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:57.920\n and just throw.\n\n2:01:58.920 --> 2:02:01.120\n I'd put my money on Kayla.\n\n2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:03.600\n Unless he's, you know, if he could go place\n\n2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:05.560\n in the nationals in Russia, he would beat her.\n\n2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:07.320\n But if he's not at that level of judo,\n\n2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:09.960\n he's more like a brown belt or he's not,\n\n2:02:09.960 --> 2:02:11.960\n he's not a high level judo player, she will win.\n\n2:02:11.960 --> 2:02:16.400\n I saw her take some of our best juniors in this country.\n\n2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:20.240\n Some of the guys that went and won our,\n\n2:02:20.240 --> 2:02:22.080\n medaled in our senior nationals.\n\n2:02:22.080 --> 2:02:25.600\n I've seen her smash all of them in judo.\n\n2:02:25.600 --> 2:02:28.480\n Now, she's not gonna do that to a Travis Stevens.\n\n2:02:28.480 --> 2:02:33.480\n She's not gonna do that to a senior national champion\n\n2:02:33.480 --> 2:02:35.760\n or an Olympian in our sport.\n\n2:02:35.760 --> 2:02:39.360\n But she will go toe to toe with every other male,\n\n2:02:39.360 --> 2:02:40.440\n black belts or not.\n\n2:02:42.640 --> 2:02:45.240\n Speaking of Khabib in Russia,\n\n2:02:46.640 --> 2:02:50.480\n Vladimir Putin, I don't know if you have heard of him,\n\n2:02:50.480 --> 2:02:54.600\n he's the president of Russia, but he's also a judoka.\n\n2:02:54.600 --> 2:02:57.400\n Have you gotten a chance to see him do judo?\n\n2:02:57.400 --> 2:03:00.240\n What do you think about his judo, if you were to analyze it?\n\n2:03:00.240 --> 2:03:02.320\n So I'm actually really good friends\n\n2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:03.920\n with the Russian Federation.\n\n2:03:05.200 --> 2:03:07.920\n The guy in charge is Ezio Gamba.\n\n2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:10.760\n He's an Italian, he's a mastermind behind their success\n\n2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:14.080\n of the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams.\n\n2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:17.560\n 2020, he suffered from leukemia, blood cancer,\n\n2:03:17.560 --> 2:03:19.920\n so he wasn't part of their 2020 program.\n\n2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:22.400\n But he was part of 2012, 2016.\n\n2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:24.600\n That whole national, the Olympic team in 2012\n\n2:03:24.600 --> 2:03:29.600\n came to our studio and lived here for a month in Boston.\n\n2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:31.000\n They went to school in Boston.\n\n2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:32.440\n I brought them to my house.\n\n2:03:32.440 --> 2:03:33.960\n They had three Olympic champions.\n\n2:03:33.960 --> 2:03:36.200\n Three Olympic champions.\n\n2:03:36.200 --> 2:03:38.360\n Oh my God, what a team.\n\n2:03:38.360 --> 2:03:40.560\n They all came and lived here in Boston for a month.\n\n2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:44.480\n They wanted to be part of experience America type program.\n\n2:03:44.480 --> 2:03:48.080\n So I've seen all of them with Putin in Russia\n\n2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:50.640\n at their national training center,\n\n2:03:50.640 --> 2:03:52.720\n working out with them and taking falls\n\n2:03:52.720 --> 2:03:53.640\n and doing judo with him.\n\n2:03:53.640 --> 2:03:58.080\n So it's hard when you're older to move in judo.\n\n2:03:58.080 --> 2:04:01.600\n I mean, I was at a high level and I'm now 51.\n\n2:04:01.600 --> 2:04:03.520\n It's hard for me to move like I used to.\n\n2:04:03.520 --> 2:04:06.520\n So at his age, he's gotta be what, 60,\n\n2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:09.080\n between 62, 65ish?\n\n2:04:09.080 --> 2:04:11.280\n I mean, it moves really well for somebody\n\n2:04:11.280 --> 2:04:16.000\n that's that age and probably hasn't done very much judo\n\n2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:17.840\n for the last however many years, right?\n\n2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:19.880\n So that tells you he, at one point,\n\n2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:21.480\n he had to be a really good judo player.\n\n2:04:21.480 --> 2:04:23.920\n Yeah, he put in a lot of work at some point\n\n2:04:23.920 --> 2:04:25.120\n to develop the technique.\n\n2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:27.520\n You could tell when a great judo player,\n\n2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:30.240\n even if they haven't practiced it,\n\n2:04:30.240 --> 2:04:32.800\n even if they're up there in age,\n\n2:04:32.800 --> 2:04:34.400\n like just the way they move,\n\n2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:35.920\n the way they go in for a Seinage,\n\n2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:38.160\n the way they go for a particular throw,\n\n2:04:38.160 --> 2:04:40.280\n the way they do foot sweeps and all that kind of stuff,\n\n2:04:40.280 --> 2:04:42.320\n you could just tell he's good at judo.\n\n2:04:42.320 --> 2:04:43.920\n And that's kind of fascinating.\n\n2:04:43.920 --> 2:04:48.240\n So it's fascinating to see political leaders.\n\n2:04:48.240 --> 2:04:50.760\n I've gotten to interact with quite a few\n\n2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:54.960\n for whom judo was a formative experience in their life.\n\n2:04:54.960 --> 2:04:57.280\n And that's so interesting that for a lot of people,\n\n2:04:57.280 --> 2:05:00.680\n judo played a big part in their life, early development.\n\n2:05:00.680 --> 2:05:04.480\n It's similar to like if you served in the military.\n\n2:05:04.480 --> 2:05:05.840\n There's just something about judo.\n\n2:05:05.840 --> 2:05:09.640\n It's the, as a martial art, it's not just the technique.\n\n2:05:09.640 --> 2:05:13.200\n So yes, there's something about gaining confidence\n\n2:05:13.200 --> 2:05:17.080\n through becoming aware of what like your body can do,\n\n2:05:17.080 --> 2:05:20.480\n the sort of the artistry and the skill of it,\n\n2:05:20.480 --> 2:05:22.480\n also the power of being able to dominate\n\n2:05:22.480 --> 2:05:24.640\n another human being with technique,\n\n2:05:24.640 --> 2:05:28.880\n but also like the, I don't know, the formality,\n\n2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:33.560\n the discipline of just honoring the tradition of it.\n\n2:05:33.560 --> 2:05:36.960\n So all of that mixed together somehow creates.\n\n2:05:36.960 --> 2:05:37.840\n Memories.\n\n2:05:37.840 --> 2:05:40.600\n It creates memories that kind of define you\n\n2:05:40.600 --> 2:05:42.720\n as a human being and that you carry that forward\n\n2:05:42.720 --> 2:05:43.600\n throughout your life.\n\n2:05:43.600 --> 2:05:45.400\n And I've just been surprised to know\n\n2:05:45.400 --> 2:05:48.400\n how many powerful people internationally\n\n2:05:48.400 --> 2:05:53.400\n have like in their heart, in their, who they are, judo.\n\n2:05:53.560 --> 2:05:54.400\n For sure.\n\n2:05:54.400 --> 2:05:55.240\n At the core of it.\n\n2:05:55.240 --> 2:05:57.640\n It makes you the human being that you are.\n\n2:05:57.640 --> 2:05:58.480\n It really does.\n\n2:05:58.480 --> 2:06:01.120\n Like it becomes a fabric of,\n\n2:06:01.120 --> 2:06:02.560\n the people that stick with it, right?\n\n2:06:02.560 --> 2:06:03.760\n That stay with it.\n\n2:06:03.760 --> 2:06:07.520\n Because it, I mean, it teaches you so many lessons.\n\n2:06:07.520 --> 2:06:09.680\n It's so memorable because of what you talked about,\n\n2:06:09.680 --> 2:06:10.640\n the tradition.\n\n2:06:10.640 --> 2:06:14.280\n But it's also, you grow with other people,\n\n2:06:14.280 --> 2:06:16.560\n and you learn from other people\n\n2:06:16.560 --> 2:06:18.840\n and you experience things with other people.\n\n2:06:18.840 --> 2:06:23.840\n It's such a hands on sport that it's very memorable.\n\n2:06:24.160 --> 2:06:25.920\n And people love it so much.\n\n2:06:25.920 --> 2:06:30.040\n Like right now at my dojo, we have like four generations.\n\n2:06:30.040 --> 2:06:33.160\n Like somebody that did judo with my dad,\n\n2:06:33.160 --> 2:06:36.000\n had a kid who trained with me,\n\n2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:39.040\n who loved judo so much, had a kid.\n\n2:06:39.040 --> 2:06:43.920\n That kid was now in his 20s who did judo.\n\n2:06:43.920 --> 2:06:45.880\n And now has a kid who's two or three or four\n\n2:06:45.880 --> 2:06:48.240\n that's coming to my toddler program at my school.\n\n2:06:48.240 --> 2:06:49.920\n Like we're talking four generations.\n\n2:06:49.920 --> 2:06:52.600\n And they all love the experience so much\n\n2:06:52.600 --> 2:06:54.720\n and what it did for them and their lives\n\n2:06:54.720 --> 2:06:56.480\n that they wanted the next generation\n\n2:06:56.480 --> 2:06:58.160\n to also experience the same thing.\n\n2:06:59.760 --> 2:07:00.920\n This is a tricky question,\n\n2:07:00.920 --> 2:07:03.240\n but if people are interested in judo\n\n2:07:03.240 --> 2:07:04.840\n and want to start learning it,\n\n2:07:04.840 --> 2:07:08.640\n in the United States there's thousands of jiu jitsu schools,\n\n2:07:08.640 --> 2:07:11.520\n for example, is there advice you can give\n\n2:07:11.520 --> 2:07:13.800\n to people interested in judo\n\n2:07:13.800 --> 2:07:18.800\n or maybe to jiu jitsu gym owners?\n\n2:07:19.840 --> 2:07:24.840\n Like how do you get judo as part of your life in America?\n\n2:07:25.360 --> 2:07:26.480\n Well, I mean, if you're fortunate\n\n2:07:26.480 --> 2:07:28.880\n to live near another dojo, right?\n\n2:07:28.880 --> 2:07:30.640\n A place that has judo locally,\n\n2:07:30.640 --> 2:07:32.720\n then that's your best opportunity to learn\n\n2:07:32.720 --> 2:07:35.080\n is to go learn from another school.\n\n2:07:35.080 --> 2:07:39.240\n Unfortunately, sometimes the nearest dojo\n\n2:07:39.240 --> 2:07:41.560\n might not be for two hours or three hours\n\n2:07:41.560 --> 2:07:44.480\n away from where you're at, which is an obstacle.\n\n2:07:44.480 --> 2:07:45.320\n You're not gonna do that.\n\n2:07:45.320 --> 2:07:47.760\n So, I mean, Travis and I did start\n\n2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:50.360\n the American Judo System online.\n\n2:07:50.360 --> 2:07:52.840\n It's at usajudo.com.\n\n2:07:52.840 --> 2:07:57.040\n And we've broken down every single judo technique\n\n2:07:57.040 --> 2:08:00.360\n to the very, very basic elements of just movement.\n\n2:08:00.360 --> 2:08:04.360\n So we teach every technique of how you do it mechanically\n\n2:08:04.360 --> 2:08:05.760\n with just your feet,\n\n2:08:05.760 --> 2:08:09.320\n then how you incorporate your hands and your feet together,\n\n2:08:09.320 --> 2:08:11.120\n how you do it in all directions,\n\n2:08:11.120 --> 2:08:13.320\n moving forward, sideways, backwards,\n\n2:08:13.320 --> 2:08:17.080\n how to then introduce a partner into the movement,\n\n2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:23.000\n how to do basic uchi komi or repetitions with a partner,\n\n2:08:23.040 --> 2:08:24.440\n then moving with a partner,\n\n2:08:24.440 --> 2:08:26.400\n then how to throw your opponent static,\n\n2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:27.280\n how to throw your opponent.\n\n2:08:27.280 --> 2:08:30.760\n So basically from the very foundation of the movement\n\n2:08:30.760 --> 2:08:33.080\n all the way to the most advanced level,\n\n2:08:33.080 --> 2:08:36.880\n we've documented this through separate videos.\n\n2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:41.680\n And we've taken now, I think 12 to 15 of standing techniques\n\n2:08:41.680 --> 2:08:44.560\n combined with a whole bunch of groundwork techniques.\n\n2:08:44.560 --> 2:08:48.000\n And our goal is just to continue to build this platform out\n\n2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:51.440\n so that anybody anywhere can learn online\n\n2:08:51.440 --> 2:08:52.480\n and can ask questions.\n\n2:08:52.480 --> 2:08:54.840\n We have a live training class every couple of weeks,\n\n2:08:54.840 --> 2:08:58.520\n every two weeks, he or I answer questions online\n\n2:08:58.520 --> 2:09:00.280\n for our members.\n\n2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:04.560\n Ideally, what we'd like to do is have a standing curriculum\n\n2:09:04.560 --> 2:09:07.760\n for jujitsu instructors that want to learn\n\n2:09:07.760 --> 2:09:09.240\n and become black belts in judo.\n\n2:09:09.240 --> 2:09:11.280\n Here's how, these are the techniques you need to know.\n\n2:09:11.280 --> 2:09:13.200\n This is how many reps you need to do.\n\n2:09:13.200 --> 2:09:16.440\n This is how efficient you need to get at those techniques\n\n2:09:16.440 --> 2:09:18.960\n to become certified as an instructor\n\n2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:20.880\n or become a black belt.\n\n2:09:20.880 --> 2:09:23.240\n And eventually have an online promotion system\n\n2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:26.440\n where anybody anywhere can just submit videos\n\n2:09:26.440 --> 2:09:29.360\n and show us that they can do those techniques.\n\n2:09:29.360 --> 2:09:31.080\n And obviously we'll have people review them.\n\n2:09:31.080 --> 2:09:33.440\n And this is a dream and a vision,\n\n2:09:33.440 --> 2:09:35.720\n but we've already started the platform.\n\n2:09:35.720 --> 2:09:39.160\n We're about to do a collaborative effort with USA Judo\n\n2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:41.160\n where all of their members will start to get access\n\n2:09:41.160 --> 2:09:42.720\n to this platform as well.\n\n2:09:42.720 --> 2:09:45.840\n And if we can get that influx of money\n\n2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:49.520\n and people on the platform, it'll allow us to hire\n\n2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:51.160\n and grow it faster.\n\n2:09:51.160 --> 2:09:54.920\n So you also want to do certification there.\n\n2:09:54.920 --> 2:09:56.560\n It's not just instruction.\n\n2:09:56.560 --> 2:09:58.160\n Correct.\n\n2:09:58.160 --> 2:09:59.840\n That would be amazing.\n\n2:09:59.840 --> 2:10:01.240\n Yeah.\n\n2:10:01.240 --> 2:10:02.520\n I mean, for me personally, sort of,\n\n2:10:02.520 --> 2:10:04.680\n I mean, mostly in Austin, Texas now.\n\n2:10:04.680 --> 2:10:05.520\n Right.\n\n2:10:05.520 --> 2:10:10.160\n And there's a few judo schools, but it's not really.\n\n2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:11.000\n Right.\n\n2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:13.040\n There's not, and it's just one of those cities\n\n2:10:13.040 --> 2:10:15.280\n that doesn't quite have, I mean, there's a few,\n\n2:10:15.280 --> 2:10:18.160\n it's basically just like a few random judo people\n\n2:10:18.160 --> 2:10:20.200\n that kind of kind of gather together\n\n2:10:20.200 --> 2:10:23.840\n a couple of times a week, but it's not a system,\n\n2:10:23.840 --> 2:10:28.840\n a dojo, an instructor, integrated into a jiu jitsu school\n\n2:10:29.480 --> 2:10:30.520\n or not.\n\n2:10:30.520 --> 2:10:33.920\n The problem with most judo dojos right now\n\n2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:37.800\n is that most of them cater towards the competitive side.\n\n2:10:39.080 --> 2:10:41.480\n Also, a lot of them do it recreationally,\n\n2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:43.240\n meaning this isn't how they make a living.\n\n2:10:43.240 --> 2:10:44.840\n So they're there three nights a week,\n\n2:10:44.840 --> 2:10:45.800\n or they're there five,\n\n2:10:45.800 --> 2:10:47.240\n even if they're there five nights a week,\n\n2:10:47.240 --> 2:10:50.960\n it's still only one junior class and one senior class,\n\n2:10:50.960 --> 2:10:51.800\n and that's it.\n\n2:10:51.800 --> 2:10:53.160\n And it's one size fits all.\n\n2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:54.600\n Doesn't matter what level you're at,\n\n2:10:54.600 --> 2:10:55.560\n it's one size fits all.\n\n2:10:55.560 --> 2:10:58.040\n So you can't get out of the training\n\n2:10:58.040 --> 2:10:59.600\n what you're looking to get out of the training.\n\n2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:01.600\n It's whatever the instructor's teaching.\n\n2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:04.880\n And you can't learn because it's not\n\n2:11:04.880 --> 2:11:06.280\n at the appropriate level for you.\n\n2:11:06.280 --> 2:11:08.320\n And usually you're pushed into doing randori\n\n2:11:08.320 --> 2:11:09.200\n where you have no choice\n\n2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:11.360\n but to do the randori part of the training.\n\n2:11:13.040 --> 2:11:14.600\n So it's a challenge to go learn.\n\n2:11:14.600 --> 2:11:18.200\n And then a lot of times the schools are old school,\n\n2:11:18.200 --> 2:11:20.240\n so they go make you do falls for a half hour.\n\n2:11:20.240 --> 2:11:22.400\n They make you do things,\n\n2:11:22.400 --> 2:11:23.680\n maybe you're a jujitsu person\n\n2:11:23.680 --> 2:11:25.240\n who knows how to fall already,\n\n2:11:25.240 --> 2:11:27.160\n but you haven't proven it to the judo instructor\n\n2:11:27.160 --> 2:11:28.360\n and they don't break the norm\n\n2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:30.160\n and say you still have to fall for six months,\n\n2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:32.480\n which turns a lot of people away as well.\n\n2:11:32.480 --> 2:11:36.120\n So it's like any business.\n\n2:11:36.120 --> 2:11:40.880\n If you don't deliver on your customer's expectations,\n\n2:11:40.880 --> 2:11:42.880\n you're not gonna have very many customers,\n\n2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:44.480\n which is the way it is now.\n\n2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:47.560\n So a lot of people who listen to this,\n\n2:11:47.560 --> 2:11:49.120\n but in general in the United States\n\n2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:51.320\n practice Brazilian jujitsu,\n\n2:11:51.320 --> 2:11:54.080\n which has a lot of similarities to judo\n\n2:11:54.080 --> 2:11:56.200\n as obviously its origins in judo.\n\n2:11:57.360 --> 2:11:59.240\n How would you compare the two arts\n\n2:11:59.240 --> 2:12:00.800\n from the perspective of people\n\n2:12:00.800 --> 2:12:03.120\n just interested about both arts?\n\n2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:07.400\n Do you recommend people who do jujitsu get into judo?\n\n2:12:08.440 --> 2:12:10.560\n How can it enrich their jujitsu?\n\n2:12:10.560 --> 2:12:11.920\n How do you compare the two arts,\n\n2:12:11.920 --> 2:12:15.640\n the actual practice of it and why it might be useful to you?\n\n2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:19.680\n I mean, I think that judo is a hard sport for adults to do.\n\n2:12:19.680 --> 2:12:20.840\n It just is.\n\n2:12:20.840 --> 2:12:24.440\n Especially people that haven't fallen in a long time,\n\n2:12:24.440 --> 2:12:27.200\n aren't very athletic, haven't...\n\n2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:29.960\n I think about my own experience, right?\n\n2:12:29.960 --> 2:12:30.880\n Other than judo,\n\n2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:33.760\n when did I ever do like a forward somersault?\n\n2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:35.680\n Maybe when I was in grade school, right?\n\n2:12:35.680 --> 2:12:39.080\n That's the last time I've left my feet was in grade school.\n\n2:12:39.080 --> 2:12:42.760\n Most people haven't got off of a chair or a couch.\n\n2:12:42.760 --> 2:12:45.000\n They spend eight to 10 hours a day\n\n2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:46.400\n either working behind a computer\n\n2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:48.800\n or sitting on their couch watching TV, right?\n\n2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:50.560\n And they're not that athletic.\n\n2:12:50.560 --> 2:12:51.880\n And they haven't done anything athletic\n\n2:12:51.880 --> 2:12:55.080\n at least probably since high school, right?\n\n2:12:55.080 --> 2:12:57.400\n That's their last athletic endeavor, most of them.\n\n2:12:57.400 --> 2:12:59.040\n So you're talking about as an adult,\n\n2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:01.920\n that's 35 or 40 wanting to start a sport.\n\n2:13:01.920 --> 2:13:04.040\n Judo is a really hard sport to start,\n\n2:13:04.040 --> 2:13:06.880\n especially in today's dojos\n\n2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:09.720\n that don't have a recreational adult program.\n\n2:13:09.720 --> 2:13:11.640\n You know, when it's one size fits all, it's hard.\n\n2:13:11.640 --> 2:13:13.000\n So for those people,\n\n2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:15.720\n jujitsu makes a heck of a lot of sense.\n\n2:13:15.720 --> 2:13:18.800\n Good self defense, it's cerebral,\n\n2:13:18.800 --> 2:13:21.360\n where you got to use your brain, you're a smaller person,\n\n2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:23.160\n you have to use technique, you know,\n\n2:13:23.160 --> 2:13:25.400\n it teaches all the same things as judo,\n\n2:13:25.400 --> 2:13:27.040\n but it's a safe way to do it.\n\n2:13:27.040 --> 2:13:30.120\n And because of the validation it has\n\n2:13:30.120 --> 2:13:33.120\n with the UFC and MMA today, right?\n\n2:13:33.120 --> 2:13:34.560\n Everybody knows jujitsu.\n\n2:13:34.560 --> 2:13:37.120\n So now they can be part of mainstream society\n\n2:13:37.120 --> 2:13:40.240\n and talk intelligently about what they see on television\n\n2:13:40.240 --> 2:13:42.200\n or what's going on on ESPN today, right?\n\n2:13:42.200 --> 2:13:43.080\n They have some knowledge.\n\n2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:45.840\n So they have an identity.\n\n2:13:45.840 --> 2:13:47.880\n And also there's a good culture in jujitsu\n\n2:13:47.880 --> 2:13:49.480\n where it's becoming a family.\n\n2:13:49.480 --> 2:13:51.400\n You know, the dojo is the family place.\n\n2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:54.000\n You go to feel good, you go to see your friends,\n\n2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:57.200\n you go to get fit and you have a good time, right?\n\n2:13:57.200 --> 2:13:59.840\n So it makes a lot of sense why it's growing.\n\n2:13:59.840 --> 2:14:01.040\n Judo on the other hand,\n\n2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:04.480\n I think is a better sport for children to do.\n\n2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:08.280\n It's more, I would say fun and interactive.\n\n2:14:08.280 --> 2:14:10.160\n It's a little easier to teach the kids\n\n2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:12.240\n how to do the throwing skills\n\n2:14:12.240 --> 2:14:14.360\n and for safety and things like that.\n\n2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:16.840\n Their body can handle more than the adults can.\n\n2:14:16.840 --> 2:14:18.680\n They're less likely to get injured.\n\n2:14:20.320 --> 2:14:21.600\n It makes them better athletes\n\n2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:24.480\n because it's a lot more three dimensional in my opinion.\n\n2:14:25.880 --> 2:14:27.080\n So I think there's a good fit\n\n2:14:27.080 --> 2:14:32.080\n between judo can thrive from kids till whatever,\n\n2:14:32.200 --> 2:14:34.160\n high school, college.\n\n2:14:34.160 --> 2:14:37.800\n Jujitsu thrives from that 18 year old up, right?\n\n2:14:37.800 --> 2:14:40.520\n Right now, that's kind of where it is.\n\n2:14:40.520 --> 2:14:43.720\n So as a dojo, you have to kind of focus on the teens\n\n2:14:43.720 --> 2:14:46.880\n and the college, like early 20s, that kind of.\n\n2:14:46.880 --> 2:14:48.640\n Or you need to have,\n\n2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:50.600\n if you're gonna be a successful judo dojo,\n\n2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:53.920\n you have to have that recreational\n\n2:14:53.920 --> 2:14:56.720\n fundamental adult program in your school\n\n2:14:56.720 --> 2:15:00.800\n where people actually come to judo, learn the moves,\n\n2:15:00.800 --> 2:15:03.560\n but aren't pushed into randori training\n\n2:15:03.560 --> 2:15:05.800\n and pushed into things where they're uncomfortable\n\n2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:07.840\n and they can't control the situation\n\n2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:09.520\n because there's too many unknowns.\n\n2:15:09.520 --> 2:15:12.520\n You got an education at Browns.\n\n2:15:12.520 --> 2:15:15.440\n You're somebody, it's amazing because as an Olympian\n\n2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:17.440\n and an Olympic coach, you always emphasize\n\n2:15:17.440 --> 2:15:22.440\n kind of balance and education, all of that side of life.\n\n2:15:22.440 --> 2:15:24.280\n So developing your brain too.\n\n2:15:24.280 --> 2:15:27.640\n So you are an Olympic medalist,\n\n2:15:27.640 --> 2:15:31.080\n a coach of Olympic medalists, you're a business owner.\n\n2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:33.840\n So successful in all these domains.\n\n2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:36.680\n So I have to ask, what advice would you give\n\n2:15:36.680 --> 2:15:40.960\n to young people today, high school, judo age,\n\n2:15:40.960 --> 2:15:43.240\n high school, college, undergrad,\n\n2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:47.520\n how to be successful in their career\n\n2:15:47.520 --> 2:15:48.960\n or just in life in general,\n\n2:15:48.960 --> 2:15:51.760\n how to live a life they can be proud of?\n\n2:15:53.920 --> 2:15:56.080\n I think you have to be true to yourself.\n\n2:15:56.080 --> 2:15:58.840\n You have to decide what it is you really wanna do\n\n2:15:58.840 --> 2:15:59.680\n with your life.\n\n2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:02.280\n Like, and it's hard because when I grew up,\n\n2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:04.200\n I didn't know I was gonna be successful.\n\n2:16:04.200 --> 2:16:06.880\n When I was young, I didn't know I was gonna be\n\n2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:07.720\n an Olympic medalist.\n\n2:16:07.720 --> 2:16:10.600\n I certainly did envision myself owning a couple of companies\n\n2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:14.320\n that makes their living exclusively from martial arts\n\n2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:16.240\n or judo, cause that wasn't really an opportunity\n\n2:16:16.240 --> 2:16:19.200\n when I was a kid, but I've created that opportunity.\n\n2:16:19.200 --> 2:16:21.280\n I would just say that, pick something\n\n2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:23.120\n that you're passionate about.\n\n2:16:23.120 --> 2:16:24.640\n I was stuck in a career before\n\n2:16:24.640 --> 2:16:26.480\n where I wasn't passionate about it.\n\n2:16:26.480 --> 2:16:28.800\n And it was my wife who said, Jimmy,\n\n2:16:28.800 --> 2:16:32.560\n if you can figure out how to make your living\n\n2:16:32.560 --> 2:16:35.000\n exclusively from martial arts,\n\n2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:37.440\n where your brain and your heart and your passion\n\n2:16:37.440 --> 2:16:40.640\n is all towards one thing that you really like,\n\n2:16:40.640 --> 2:16:41.800\n then you'll be successful.\n\n2:16:41.800 --> 2:16:42.800\n And I left the job.\n\n2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:43.640\n I had three kids.\n\n2:16:43.640 --> 2:16:46.480\n I was working for monster.com.\n\n2:16:46.480 --> 2:16:48.280\n I was in internet marketing\n\n2:16:48.280 --> 2:16:50.080\n and I was working for that great company,\n\n2:16:50.080 --> 2:16:51.560\n nothing wrong with the company,\n\n2:16:51.560 --> 2:16:55.040\n but sitting behind the desk from eight till five.\n\n2:16:55.040 --> 2:16:59.040\n And then I get to go to judo from six till nine at night.\n\n2:16:59.040 --> 2:17:00.680\n My whole day is tied up doing something\n\n2:17:00.680 --> 2:17:02.640\n that I'm really not passionate about.\n\n2:17:02.640 --> 2:17:05.800\n She said, if you can figure out how to make money\n\n2:17:05.800 --> 2:17:08.880\n from your dojo and other things judo related,\n\n2:17:08.880 --> 2:17:10.200\n then I think you'll be successful.\n\n2:17:10.200 --> 2:17:11.760\n And so she's the one that my wife, Marie,\n\n2:17:11.760 --> 2:17:13.920\n gave me that advice and I would give that to others.\n\n2:17:13.920 --> 2:17:15.720\n Find something that you love doing\n\n2:17:15.720 --> 2:17:17.400\n where it doesn't feel like work,\n\n2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:18.720\n something you're passionate about.\n\n2:17:18.720 --> 2:17:20.800\n And if the opportunity doesn't exist\n\n2:17:20.800 --> 2:17:23.680\n how to make money on it, you can create the opportunity.\n\n2:17:23.680 --> 2:17:25.680\n Be resourceful, figure it out.\n\n2:17:25.680 --> 2:17:28.000\n Don't let anybody tell you you can't do it.\n\n2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:31.680\n I didn't know that I could have a 200 person judo school\n\n2:17:31.680 --> 2:17:33.000\n that only taught judo\n\n2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:35.800\n because that really didn't exist in this country.\n\n2:17:35.800 --> 2:17:38.840\n That actually charges money like jujitsu charges.\n\n2:17:38.840 --> 2:17:41.040\n We're talking not, there's plenty of clubs out there\n\n2:17:41.040 --> 2:17:43.480\n that charge 10 bucks a month that might have 100 people,\n\n2:17:43.480 --> 2:17:45.040\n but there's not many that,\n\n2:17:45.040 --> 2:17:48.400\n where the tuition is $150 a month having 200 people.\n\n2:17:48.400 --> 2:17:52.880\n So that's a successful business, but it wasn't done before.\n\n2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:55.800\n But be passionate about it, understand you're gonna fail,\n\n2:17:55.800 --> 2:17:58.920\n understand you're gonna get knocked down, beat up, right?\n\n2:17:58.920 --> 2:18:01.920\n There's gonna be dark days, but you gotta persevere.\n\n2:18:01.920 --> 2:18:03.240\n You gotta believe in yourself.\n\n2:18:03.240 --> 2:18:04.840\n You gotta have a plan.\n\n2:18:04.840 --> 2:18:07.840\n You have to be willing to learn from other people.\n\n2:18:07.840 --> 2:18:09.520\n And that's what I did.\n\n2:18:09.520 --> 2:18:12.120\n If I didn't know it, I brought somebody in to tell me,\n\n2:18:12.120 --> 2:18:13.120\n what am I doing wrong?\n\n2:18:13.120 --> 2:18:15.280\n Like, look from the outside, what do you see?\n\n2:18:15.280 --> 2:18:16.120\n Okay, great.\n\n2:18:16.120 --> 2:18:17.840\n Then you gotta be willing to change.\n\n2:18:17.840 --> 2:18:20.040\n You gotta be willing to adapt.\n\n2:18:20.040 --> 2:18:24.360\n And I think listening, believing in myself,\n\n2:18:24.360 --> 2:18:26.280\n and creating opportunity.\n\n2:18:26.280 --> 2:18:28.960\n And the other thing is helping others.\n\n2:18:28.960 --> 2:18:33.480\n Something I always did in my judo life\n\n2:18:33.480 --> 2:18:35.600\n and in my business life.\n\n2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:38.320\n If somebody came to me and asked for help with,\n\n2:18:38.320 --> 2:18:40.280\n hey man, is there something you can do to help me?\n\n2:18:40.280 --> 2:18:42.040\n I'm trying to get this thing started.\n\n2:18:42.040 --> 2:18:44.920\n I'm trying to get this dojo off the ground,\n\n2:18:44.920 --> 2:18:47.120\n or I'm trying to run this event series,\n\n2:18:47.120 --> 2:18:51.000\n or I was creative and trying to figure out a way\n\n2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:52.480\n to help them make it work.\n\n2:18:52.480 --> 2:18:54.560\n Because if that really was their dream,\n\n2:18:54.560 --> 2:18:56.560\n and I could help them do their dream,\n\n2:18:56.560 --> 2:19:00.640\n I felt like that person would then give nothing\n\n2:19:00.640 --> 2:19:02.600\n but good, good comments about us.\n\n2:19:02.600 --> 2:19:05.080\n Good, good, like they'll remember it forever.\n\n2:19:05.080 --> 2:19:06.640\n They become like family.\n\n2:19:06.640 --> 2:19:09.560\n And they'll be the best advocates for your business ever.\n\n2:19:09.560 --> 2:19:12.200\n And so the kids that I taught at my dojo\n\n2:19:12.200 --> 2:19:13.400\n were treated that way.\n\n2:19:13.400 --> 2:19:15.560\n The people that worked for me get treated that way.\n\n2:19:15.560 --> 2:19:18.600\n The people that, my customers that I work with\n\n2:19:18.600 --> 2:19:20.800\n and building their dojos,\n\n2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:22.600\n get treated that way.\n\n2:19:22.600 --> 2:19:23.760\n People that ran tournaments,\n\n2:19:23.760 --> 2:19:26.280\n whether it was Grappler's Quest years ago,\n\n2:19:26.280 --> 2:19:28.240\n and helping that guy with a full set of mats\n\n2:19:28.240 --> 2:19:31.040\n for his, Brian Simmons with his thing,\n\n2:19:31.040 --> 2:19:34.720\n or any of the Gracie's.\n\n2:19:34.720 --> 2:19:36.480\n It just became like family.\n\n2:19:36.480 --> 2:19:38.080\n And then I just work hard and deliver\n\n2:19:38.080 --> 2:19:39.720\n on what I say I'm gonna do.\n\n2:19:39.720 --> 2:19:41.880\n If I say I'm gonna do it, I do it.\n\n2:19:41.880 --> 2:19:43.560\n And I think it goes a long way.\n\n2:19:43.560 --> 2:19:44.800\n Well, and I got a comment.\n\n2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:48.320\n So in a small way, people may not know.\n\n2:19:48.320 --> 2:19:49.720\n I think it's still on YouTube.\n\n2:19:49.720 --> 2:19:52.160\n We previously talked many years ago.\n\n2:19:52.160 --> 2:19:56.320\n And I remember it, you were so kind to me.\n\n2:19:56.320 --> 2:19:58.200\n And you didn't really know who I was.\n\n2:19:58.200 --> 2:20:00.360\n You just took me as a human being.\n\n2:20:00.360 --> 2:20:01.880\n You welcomed me into your dojo.\n\n2:20:01.880 --> 2:20:04.400\n And we just had a conversation on a podcast\n\n2:20:04.400 --> 2:20:06.320\n or whatever the heck you call that thing.\n\n2:20:06.320 --> 2:20:08.440\n And you were just very kind.\n\n2:20:08.440 --> 2:20:11.480\n And you were also just,\n\n2:20:12.920 --> 2:20:15.600\n it was the last conversation I had\n\n2:20:15.600 --> 2:20:17.840\n when I showed up to MIT,\n\n2:20:17.840 --> 2:20:20.200\n and it stayed with me.\n\n2:20:20.200 --> 2:20:23.120\n So I've resumed doing this podcast.\n\n2:20:23.120 --> 2:20:24.920\n But it stayed with me because you said\n\n2:20:26.720 --> 2:20:28.960\n that I did a good job at this.\n\n2:20:28.960 --> 2:20:30.960\n And people, especially at that time,\n\n2:20:30.960 --> 2:20:32.560\n didn't tell me that.\n\n2:20:33.680 --> 2:20:36.200\n And just that little act of kindness\n\n2:20:36.200 --> 2:20:38.080\n is probably just a regular part of your day.\n\n2:20:38.080 --> 2:20:40.080\n You had a busy day, it was the end of the day.\n\n2:20:40.080 --> 2:20:42.760\n Just saying that, that was powerful.\n\n2:20:42.760 --> 2:20:45.000\n And that pays off somehow.\n\n2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:47.120\n So thank you for that.\n\n2:20:47.120 --> 2:20:49.560\n Yeah, but it was sincere, right?\n\n2:20:49.560 --> 2:20:50.400\n It was genuine.\n\n2:20:50.400 --> 2:20:53.320\n I felt like I had been to so many interviews.\n\n2:20:53.320 --> 2:20:54.840\n When it's around the Olympic time,\n\n2:20:54.840 --> 2:20:56.800\n there's lots of beat reporters that come out\n\n2:20:56.800 --> 2:20:58.200\n and they're trying to get your time.\n\n2:20:58.200 --> 2:21:01.360\n And they're there because they have to get the story\n\n2:21:01.360 --> 2:21:03.600\n for their newspaper or their television show.\n\n2:21:03.600 --> 2:21:06.160\n And a lot of times those people show up, right?\n\n2:21:06.160 --> 2:21:08.840\n And they pronounce my name wrong.\n\n2:21:08.840 --> 2:21:10.880\n Or they get something wrong about the background.\n\n2:21:10.880 --> 2:21:14.880\n Or they offend me because they call me for the wrong reason.\n\n2:21:14.880 --> 2:21:16.960\n Or they call me five minutes before\n\n2:21:16.960 --> 2:21:18.200\n that they're supposed to be there and say,\n\n2:21:18.200 --> 2:21:19.440\n oh, sorry, we're running late.\n\n2:21:19.440 --> 2:21:20.520\n We'll be there in an hour and a half.\n\n2:21:20.520 --> 2:21:22.440\n Well, I'm a busy guy too.\n\n2:21:22.440 --> 2:21:25.440\n But you were somebody that showed up,\n\n2:21:25.440 --> 2:21:27.120\n was so prepared with your notes,\n\n2:21:27.120 --> 2:21:32.120\n knew everything about the history of what I had done.\n\n2:21:32.120 --> 2:21:34.920\n The questions you asked were intelligent questions.\n\n2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:36.400\n They were well thought out.\n\n2:21:36.400 --> 2:21:38.440\n And at the end of that interview,\n\n2:21:38.440 --> 2:21:41.400\n I was really genuinely impressed.\n\n2:21:41.400 --> 2:21:43.960\n And I wanted to let you know you did a great job\n\n2:21:43.960 --> 2:21:45.240\n and you stood out from the rest.\n\n2:21:45.240 --> 2:21:46.080\n Thank you.\n\n2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:46.920\n Yeah.\n\n2:21:46.920 --> 2:21:48.640\n I mean, for me, it was like showing up to like the Mecca,\n\n2:21:48.640 --> 2:21:49.480\n like the track.\n\n2:21:49.480 --> 2:21:51.240\n I mean, I didn't, you know,\n\n2:21:51.240 --> 2:21:53.200\n you don't always want to just tell that to people,\n\n2:21:53.200 --> 2:21:55.400\n but you show up, you know,\n\n2:21:55.400 --> 2:21:58.720\n obviously you're the legend of judo in the United States.\n\n2:21:58.720 --> 2:22:01.640\n And so that was like, Boston is the Mecca.\n\n2:22:01.640 --> 2:22:02.960\n Right.\n\n2:22:02.960 --> 2:22:06.640\n I think that's where you travel to talk to the great.\n\n2:22:06.640 --> 2:22:09.200\n So the fact that you were kind to me\n\n2:22:09.200 --> 2:22:11.040\n just stuck with me for a long time.\n\n2:22:11.040 --> 2:22:14.680\n So it pays off to be kind to others,\n\n2:22:14.680 --> 2:22:19.680\n to give them a chance.\n\n2:22:20.080 --> 2:22:23.240\n Jimmy, thank you so much for giving me another chance\n\n2:22:23.240 --> 2:22:24.680\n and spending your valuable time.\n\n2:22:24.680 --> 2:22:27.440\n And you've also were kind enough to invite me\n\n2:22:27.440 --> 2:22:30.120\n to train with you today at your dojo.\n\n2:22:30.120 --> 2:22:31.400\n So I can't wait.\n\n2:22:31.400 --> 2:22:32.240\n Let's go.\n\n2:22:32.240 --> 2:22:33.080\n Let's go do some judo.\n\n2:22:33.080 --> 2:22:33.920\n Yeah, awesome.\n\n2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:35.440\n Thank you, Lex.\n\n2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:38.520\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jimmy Pedro.\n\n2:22:38.520 --> 2:22:41.400\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors\n\n2:22:41.400 --> 2:22:43.040\n in the description.\n\n2:22:43.040 --> 2:22:46.240\n And now let me leave you some words from Bruce Lee.\n\n2:22:46.240 --> 2:22:50.560\n I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once,\n\n2:22:50.560 --> 2:22:55.400\n but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.\n\n2:22:55.400 --> 2:23:07.920\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
