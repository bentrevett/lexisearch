00:08.160\n specializing in the study of primates\n\n00:08.160 --> 00:12.200\n and the evolution of violence, sex, cooking, culture,\n\n00:12.200 --> 00:15.160\n and other aspects of ape and human behavior\n\n00:15.160 --> 00:18.360\n at the individual and societal level.\n\n00:18.360 --> 00:20.960\n He began his career over four decades ago\n\n00:20.960 --> 00:22.340\n working with Jane Goodall\n\n00:22.340 --> 00:24.560\n and studying the behavior of chimps,\n\n00:24.560 --> 00:27.320\n and since then has done a lot of seminal work\n\n00:27.320 --> 00:29.800\n on human evolution and has proposed\n\n00:29.800 --> 00:33.380\n several theories for the roles of fire and violence\n\n00:33.380 --> 00:36.580\n in the evolution of us, hairless apes,\n\n00:36.580 --> 00:39.460\n otherwise known as homo sapiens.\n\n00:39.460 --> 00:41.700\n This is the Lux Friedman podcast.\n\n00:41.700 --> 00:43.520\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:43.520 --> 00:44.880\n in the description.\n\n00:44.880 --> 00:48.960\n And now, here's my conversation with Richard Wrangham.\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:53.080\n You've said that we're much less violent\n\n00:53.080 --> 00:57.000\n than our close living relatives, the chimps.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:01.000\n Can you elaborate on this point of how violent we are\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:04.500\n and how violent our evolutionary relatives are?\n\n01:04.500 --> 01:05.960\n Well, I haven't said exactly\n\n01:05.960 --> 01:07.940\n that we're less violent than chimps.\n\n01:07.940 --> 01:11.260\n What I've said is that there are two kinds of violence.\n\n01:11.260 --> 01:13.260\n One stems from proactive aggression\n\n01:13.260 --> 01:15.600\n and the other stems from reactive aggression.\n\n01:15.600 --> 01:17.840\n Proactive aggression is planned aggression.\n\n01:17.840 --> 01:20.760\n Reactive aggression is impulsive, defensive.\n\n01:20.760 --> 01:24.560\n It's reactive because it takes place\n\n01:24.560 --> 01:27.500\n in seconds after the threat.\n\n01:27.500 --> 01:30.840\n And the thing that is really striking about humans\n\n01:30.840 --> 01:35.840\n compared to our close relatives is the great reduction\n\n01:36.480 --> 01:40.240\n in the degree of reactive aggression.\n\n01:40.240 --> 01:43.160\n So we are far less violent than chimps\n\n01:43.160 --> 01:46.680\n when prompted by some relatively minor threat\n\n01:46.680 --> 01:48.620\n within our own society.\n\n01:48.620 --> 01:53.620\n And the way I judge that is with not super satisfactory data\n\n01:53.620 --> 01:58.620\n but the study which is particularly striking\n\n01:59.440 --> 02:04.440\n is one of people living as hunter gatherers\n\n02:05.200 --> 02:09.720\n in a really upsetting kind of environment,\n\n02:09.720 --> 02:14.720\n namely people in Australia living in a place\n\n02:15.300 --> 02:19.180\n where they got a lot of alcohol abuse.\n\n02:19.180 --> 02:21.640\n There's a lot of domestic violence.\n\n02:21.640 --> 02:26.640\n It's all a sort of a society that is as bad\n\n02:29.240 --> 02:30.540\n from the point of view of violence\n\n02:30.540 --> 02:33.140\n as an ordinary society can get.\n\n02:34.200 --> 02:36.880\n There's excellent data on the frequency\n\n02:36.880 --> 02:39.240\n with which people actually have physical violence\n\n02:39.240 --> 02:40.440\n and hit each other.\n\n02:40.440 --> 02:42.680\n And we can compare that to data\n\n02:42.680 --> 02:46.200\n from several different sites comparing,\n\n02:46.200 --> 02:50.100\n we're looking at chimpanzee and bonobo violence.\n\n02:50.100 --> 02:53.960\n And the difference is between two and three orders\n\n02:53.960 --> 02:55.420\n of magnitude.\n\n02:55.420 --> 02:58.120\n The frequency with which chimps and bonobos hit each other,\n\n02:58.120 --> 03:02.120\n chase each other, charge each other, physically engage\n\n03:02.120 --> 03:06.320\n is somewhere between 500 and a thousand times\n\n03:06.320 --> 03:08.360\n higher than in humans.\n\n03:08.360 --> 03:09.900\n So there's something just amazing about us.\n\n03:09.900 --> 03:13.600\n And this has been recognized for centuries.\n\n03:13.600 --> 03:17.080\n Aristotle drew attention to the fact that we behave\n\n03:17.080 --> 03:19.000\n in many ways like domesticated animals\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:21.320\n because we're so unviolent.\n\n03:21.320 --> 03:26.320\n But people say, well, what about the hideous engagements\n\n03:26.800 --> 03:29.480\n of this 20th century?\n\n03:29.480 --> 03:33.640\n The First and Second World War and much else besides.\n\n03:33.640 --> 03:37.120\n And that is all proactive violence.\n\n03:37.120 --> 03:39.860\n All of that is gangs of people\n\n03:42.280 --> 03:45.160\n making deliberate decisions to go off and attack\n\n03:45.160 --> 03:48.880\n in circumstances which ideally the attackers\n\n03:48.880 --> 03:51.360\n are going to be able to make their kills\n\n03:51.360 --> 03:53.320\n and then get out of there.\n\n03:53.320 --> 03:55.920\n In other words, not face confrontation.\n\n03:55.920 --> 03:58.780\n That's the ordinary way that armies try and work.\n\n03:58.780 --> 04:03.780\n And there it turns out that humans and chimpanzees\n\n04:04.880 --> 04:07.100\n are in a very similar kind of state.\n\n04:07.100 --> 04:10.960\n That is to say, if you look at the rate of death\n\n04:10.960 --> 04:15.460\n from chimpanzees conducting proactive coalition violence,\n\n04:15.460 --> 04:20.280\n it's very similar in many ways to what you see in humans.\n\n04:20.280 --> 04:23.580\n So we're not down regulated with proactive violence.\n\n04:23.580 --> 04:25.720\n It's just this reactive violence\n\n04:25.720 --> 04:29.160\n that is strikingly reduced in humans.\n\n04:29.160 --> 04:33.220\n So chimpanzees also practiced kind of tribal warfare.\n\n04:34.040 --> 04:36.060\n Indeed they do, yeah.\n\n04:36.060 --> 04:38.960\n So this was discovered first in 1974.\n\n04:38.960 --> 04:40.960\n It was observed first in 1974,\n\n04:40.960 --> 04:45.960\n which was about the time that the first major study\n\n04:48.080 --> 04:51.200\n of chimpanzees in the wild by Jane Goodall\n\n04:51.200 --> 04:55.480\n had been going for something like five years\n\n04:55.480 --> 05:00.480\n during of the chimpanzees being observed wherever they went.\n\n05:02.760 --> 05:07.000\n Until then, they'd been observed at a feeding station\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:11.080\n where Jane was luring them in to be observed\n\n05:11.080 --> 05:12.960\n by seeing bananas, which is great.\n\n05:12.960 --> 05:15.360\n She learned a lot, but she didn't learn\n\n05:15.360 --> 05:17.920\n what was happening at the edges of their ranges.\n\n05:17.920 --> 05:22.520\n So five years later, it became very obvious\n\n05:22.520 --> 05:25.680\n that there was hostile relationships between groups.\n\n05:25.680 --> 05:30.580\n And those hostile relationships sometimes take the form\n\n05:30.580 --> 05:32.640\n of the kind of hostile relationships\n\n05:32.640 --> 05:33.740\n that you see in many animals,\n\n05:33.740 --> 05:38.740\n which is a bunch of chimps in this case\n\n05:38.960 --> 05:43.960\n shouting at a bunch of other chimps on their borders.\n\n05:44.960 --> 05:47.560\n But dramatically, in addition to that,\n\n05:47.560 --> 05:49.320\n there is a second kind of interaction.\n\n05:49.320 --> 05:54.320\n And that is when a party of chimpanzees\n\n05:55.980 --> 06:00.980\n makes a deliberate venture to the edge of their territory,\n\n06:00.980 --> 06:05.980\n silently, and then search for members of neighboring groups.\n\n06:08.200 --> 06:11.760\n And what they're searching for is a lone individual.\n\n06:11.760 --> 06:15.240\n So I've been with chimps when they've heard\n\n06:15.240 --> 06:17.960\n a lone individual under these circumstances,\n\n06:17.960 --> 06:19.960\n or what they think is a lone one,\n\n06:19.960 --> 06:23.040\n and they touch each other and look at each other\n\n06:23.040 --> 06:26.120\n and then charge forward, very excited.\n\n06:26.120 --> 06:30.880\n And then while they're charging,\n\n06:30.880 --> 06:35.520\n all of a sudden, the place where they heard a lone call\n\n06:35.520 --> 06:37.520\n erupts with a volley of calls.\n\n06:37.520 --> 06:40.860\n It was just one calling out of a larger party.\n\n06:40.860 --> 06:43.480\n And our chimps put on the brakes\n\n06:43.480 --> 06:46.680\n and scoot back for safety into their own territory.\n\n06:46.680 --> 06:49.680\n But if in fact they do find a lone individual\n\n06:49.680 --> 06:52.460\n and they can sneak up to them,\n\n06:52.460 --> 06:55.000\n then they make a deliberate attack.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:57.560\n They're hunting, they're stalking and hunting,\n\n06:57.560 --> 07:00.640\n and then they impose terrible damage,\n\n07:00.640 --> 07:03.040\n which typically ends in a kill straight away,\n\n07:03.040 --> 07:08.040\n but it might end up with the victim so damaged\n\n07:08.320 --> 07:13.320\n that they'll crawl away and die a few days or hours later.\n\n07:13.520 --> 07:15.360\n So that was a very dramatic discovery\n\n07:15.360 --> 07:20.360\n because it really made people realize for the first time\n\n07:20.480 --> 07:22.760\n that Conrad Lorentz had been wrong\n\n07:22.760 --> 07:26.880\n when in the 1960s, in his famous book, On Aggression,\n\n07:26.880 --> 07:30.800\n he said, warfare is restricted to humans.\n\n07:30.800 --> 07:33.080\n Animals do not deliberately kill each other.\n\n07:33.080 --> 07:35.160\n Well, now we know that actually there's a bunch of animals\n\n07:35.160 --> 07:36.420\n that deliberately kill each other,\n\n07:36.420 --> 07:38.560\n and they always do so under essentially\n\n07:38.560 --> 07:40.680\n the same circumstances, which is\n\n07:40.680 --> 07:44.200\n when they feel safe doing it.\n\n07:44.200 --> 07:46.860\n So humans feel safe doing it when they got a weapon.\n\n07:48.040 --> 07:52.400\n Animals feel safe when they have a coalition.\n\n07:52.400 --> 07:54.800\n A coalition that has overwhelming power\n\n07:54.800 --> 07:56.720\n compared to the victim.\n\n07:56.720 --> 07:59.400\n And so wolves will do that, and lions will do that,\n\n07:59.400 --> 08:02.480\n and hyenas will do that, and chimpanzees will do it,\n\n08:02.480 --> 08:04.280\n and humans do it too.\n\n08:05.340 --> 08:08.480\n Can they pull themselves into something\n\n08:08.480 --> 08:10.600\n that looks more like a symmetric war\n\n08:10.600 --> 08:12.660\n as opposed to an asymmetric one?\n\n08:12.660 --> 08:15.280\n So accidentally engaging on the lone individual\n\n08:15.280 --> 08:17.220\n and then getting themselves into trouble?\n\n08:17.220 --> 08:19.080\n Or are they more aggressive\n\n08:19.080 --> 08:21.360\n in avoiding these kinds of battles?\n\n08:21.360 --> 08:24.040\n No, they're very, very keen to avoid those kinds of battles,\n\n08:24.040 --> 08:27.620\n but occasionally, they can make a mistake.\n\n08:28.800 --> 08:32.320\n But so far, there have been no observations\n\n08:32.320 --> 08:33.800\n of anything like a battle\n\n08:33.800 --> 08:37.240\n in which both sides maintain themselves.\n\n08:37.240 --> 08:40.240\n And I think you can very confidently say\n\n08:40.240 --> 08:42.600\n that overwhelmingly what happens is\n\n08:42.600 --> 08:45.060\n that if they discover that there's several individuals\n\n08:45.060 --> 08:48.240\n on the other side, then both sides retreat.\n\n08:48.240 --> 08:50.280\n Nobody wants to get hurt.\n\n08:50.280 --> 08:52.000\n What they want to do is to hurt others.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:52.840\n Yes.\n\n08:52.840 --> 08:54.440\n So you mentioned Jane Goodall.\n\n08:54.440 --> 08:56.640\n You've worked with her.\n\n08:56.640 --> 08:58.120\n What was it like working with her?\n\n08:58.120 --> 08:59.720\n What have you learned from her?\n\n09:01.080 --> 09:05.000\n Well, she's a wonderfully independent, courageous person\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:09.680\n who she famously began her studies\n\n09:09.680 --> 09:14.680\n not as a qualified person in terms of education,\n\n09:14.680 --> 09:19.680\n but qualified only by enthusiasm and a considerable\n\n09:19.680 --> 09:22.600\n experience, even in her early 20s, with nature.\n\n09:24.600 --> 09:26.440\n So she's courageous in the sense\n\n09:26.440 --> 09:30.520\n of being able to take on challenges.\n\n09:30.520 --> 09:32.720\n The thing that is very impressive about her\n\n09:32.720 --> 09:37.720\n is her total fidelity to the observations,\n\n09:37.720 --> 09:42.720\n very unwilling to extend beyond the observations,\n\n09:43.800 --> 09:45.440\n waiting until they mount up\n\n09:45.440 --> 09:47.440\n and you've really got a confident picture,\n\n09:48.960 --> 09:53.640\n and tremendous attention to individuals.\n\n09:53.640 --> 09:57.200\n So that was an interesting problem from her point of view\n\n09:57.200 --> 10:02.200\n because when she got to know the chimpanzees of Gombe,\n\n10:02.440 --> 10:05.280\n this particular community of Kazakus,\n\n10:05.280 --> 10:08.040\n this particular community of Kazakela,\n\n10:08.040 --> 10:09.400\n about 60 individuals,\n\n10:10.880 --> 10:14.680\n so Gombe was in Tanzania on Lake Tanganyika.\n\n10:14.680 --> 10:16.480\n She was there initially with her mother\n\n10:16.480 --> 10:20.400\n and then alone for two or three years\n\n10:20.400 --> 10:22.600\n of really intense observation\n\n10:22.600 --> 10:24.800\n and then slowly joined by other people.\n\n10:28.120 --> 10:31.600\n What she discovered was that there were obvious differences\n\n10:31.600 --> 10:34.520\n in individual personality\n\n10:34.520 --> 10:36.400\n and the difficulty about that was that\n\n10:37.320 --> 10:42.320\n when she reported this to the larger scientific world,\n\n10:42.960 --> 10:45.920\n initially her advisors at Cambridge,\n\n10:47.440 --> 10:49.840\n they said, well, we don't know how to handle that\n\n10:49.840 --> 10:52.800\n because you've got to treat all these animals\n\n10:52.800 --> 10:54.360\n as the same basically,\n\n10:54.360 --> 10:59.360\n because there is no research tradition\n\n11:00.440 --> 11:03.200\n of thinking about personalities.\n\n11:03.200 --> 11:06.720\n Well now, whatever it is, 60 years later,\n\n11:07.800 --> 11:11.520\n the study of personalities is a very rich part\n\n11:11.520 --> 11:13.200\n of the study of animal behavior.\n\n11:14.680 --> 11:17.320\n At any rate, the important point in terms of\n\n11:17.320 --> 11:19.200\n what was she like is that she stuck to her guns\n\n11:19.200 --> 11:23.280\n and she absolutely insisted that we have to show,\n\n11:23.280 --> 11:27.360\n describe in great detail the differences in personality\n\n11:27.360 --> 11:28.360\n among these individuals\n\n11:28.360 --> 11:30.400\n and then you can leave it to the evolutionary biologists\n\n11:30.400 --> 11:32.600\n to think about what it means.\n\n11:32.600 --> 11:37.600\n So what is the process of observation like this like?\n\n11:37.840 --> 11:41.520\n Observing the personality but also observing in a way\n\n11:41.520 --> 11:45.480\n that's not projecting your beliefs about human nature\n\n11:45.480 --> 11:48.760\n or animal nature onto chimps,\n\n11:48.760 --> 11:52.520\n which is probably really tempting to project.\n\n11:52.520 --> 11:55.880\n So your understanding of the way the human world works,\n\n11:55.880 --> 11:59.360\n projecting that onto the chimp world.\n\n11:59.360 --> 12:01.560\n Yes, I mean, it's particularly difficult with chimps\n\n12:01.560 --> 12:05.200\n because chimps are so similar to humans in their behavior\n\n12:05.200 --> 12:09.720\n that it's very easy to make those projections, as you say.\n\n12:10.840 --> 12:14.840\n The process involves making very clear definitions\n\n12:14.840 --> 12:16.880\n of what a behavior is.\n\n12:18.440 --> 12:23.440\n Aggression can be defined in terms of a forceful hit,\n\n12:24.240 --> 12:25.600\n a bite, and so on,\n\n12:26.720 --> 12:30.280\n and writing down every time these things happen\n\n12:30.280 --> 12:32.640\n and then slowly totting up the numbers of times\n\n12:32.640 --> 12:35.720\n that they happen from individual A\n\n12:35.720 --> 12:37.760\n towards individuals B, C, D, and E,\n\n12:39.040 --> 12:41.600\n so that you build up a very concrete picture\n\n12:41.600 --> 12:43.760\n rather than interpreting at any point\n\n12:43.760 --> 12:44.920\n and stopping and saying,\n\n12:44.920 --> 12:47.360\n well, they seem to be rather aggressive.\n\n12:48.400 --> 12:51.760\n So the sort of formal system\n\n12:51.760 --> 12:54.480\n is that you build up a pattern of the relationships\n\n12:54.480 --> 12:58.560\n based on a description of the different types\n\n12:58.560 --> 13:00.440\n of interactions, the aggressive\n\n13:00.440 --> 13:02.000\n and the friendly interactions,\n\n13:03.080 --> 13:06.040\n and all of these are defined in concrete.\n\n13:07.600 --> 13:12.280\n And so from that, you extract a pattern of relationships.\n\n13:12.280 --> 13:16.320\n And the relationships can be defined as\n\n13:18.560 --> 13:23.560\n relatively friendly, relatively aggressive, competitive,\n\n13:23.640 --> 13:27.400\n based on the frequency of these types of interactions.\n\n13:27.400 --> 13:30.960\n And so one can talk in terms of individuals\n\n13:30.960 --> 13:34.960\n having a relationship which, on the scores of friendliness,\n\n13:34.960 --> 13:38.080\n is two standard deviations outside the mean.\n\n13:39.280 --> 13:40.960\n I mean, you know, it's...\n\n13:40.960 --> 13:44.560\n In which direction, sorry, both directions?\n\n13:45.640 --> 13:47.960\n Well, I mean, that would be, obviously,\n\n13:47.960 --> 13:49.560\n the friendly ones would be the ones\n\n13:49.560 --> 13:52.000\n who have exceptionally high rates\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.400\n of spending time close to each other,\n\n13:54.400 --> 13:56.520\n of touching each other in a gentle way,\n\n13:56.520 --> 14:00.000\n of grooming each other, and, by the way,\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:03.320\n finding that those things are correlated with each other.\n\n14:03.320 --> 14:06.880\n So it's possible to define a friendship\n\n14:06.880 --> 14:10.040\n with a capital F in a very systematic way,\n\n14:10.040 --> 14:14.680\n and to compare that between individuals,\n\n14:14.680 --> 14:18.680\n but also between communities of chimpanzees\n\n14:18.680 --> 14:21.000\n and between different species.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.360\n So that, you know, we can say that in some species,\n\n14:23.360 --> 14:26.440\n individuals have friends, and others, they don't at all.\n\n14:26.440 --> 14:29.680\n What about just, because there's different personalities\n\n14:29.680 --> 14:31.880\n and because they're so fascinating,\n\n14:31.880 --> 14:33.600\n what about sort of falling in love\n\n14:33.600 --> 14:37.200\n or forming friendships with chimps, you know?\n\n14:37.200 --> 14:42.200\n Like really, you know, connecting with them as an observer?\n\n14:43.920 --> 14:46.320\n What role does that play?\n\n14:46.320 --> 14:47.960\n Because you're tracking these individuals\n\n14:47.960 --> 14:50.760\n that are full of life and intelligence\n\n14:50.760 --> 14:53.560\n for long periods of time.\n\n14:53.560 --> 14:58.120\n Plus, as a human, especially in those days for Jane,\n\n14:58.120 --> 15:00.280\n she's alone, observing it.\n\n15:00.280 --> 15:02.080\n It gets lonely as a human.\n\n15:02.080 --> 15:05.000\n I mean, probably deeply lonely as a human being,\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.720\n observing these other intelligent species.\n\n15:07.720 --> 15:08.880\n It's a very reasonable question,\n\n15:08.880 --> 15:11.600\n and of course, Jane, in those early years,\n\n15:11.600 --> 15:15.280\n I think she's willing now to talk about the fact\n\n15:15.280 --> 15:19.840\n that she regrets, to some extent, how close she became.\n\n15:19.840 --> 15:23.560\n And the problem is not just from the humans.\n\n15:23.560 --> 15:25.400\n The problem is from the chimpanzees as well,\n\n15:25.400 --> 15:28.040\n because they do things\n\n15:28.040 --> 15:32.640\n that are extremely affectionate, if you like.\n\n15:32.640 --> 15:37.640\n You know, at one point, Jane offered a ripe fruit\n\n15:39.640 --> 15:42.240\n to a chimpanzee called David Greybeard.\n\n15:42.240 --> 15:46.400\n David Greybeard took it and squeezed her hand,\n\n15:47.640 --> 15:48.760\n as if to say thank you.\n\n15:48.760 --> 15:51.160\n And then I think he gave it back, if I remember rightly.\n\n15:51.160 --> 15:52.000\n Yeah.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:52.840\n Um.\n\n15:52.840 --> 15:55.000\n No, thank you.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:55.840\n Right.\n\n15:57.320 --> 15:59.360\n Oh, it's almost like thank you\n\n15:59.360 --> 16:02.520\n and returning the affection by giving the fruit.\n\n16:02.520 --> 16:03.360\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n16:03.360 --> 16:04.200\n If they did something like that.\n\n16:04.200 --> 16:05.960\n Yeah, no, it was a gentle squeeze.\n\n16:05.960 --> 16:08.080\n I mean, chimpanzees could squeeze you very hard,\n\n16:08.080 --> 16:10.200\n as occasionally has happened.\n\n16:11.320 --> 16:13.520\n Some chimps are aggressive to people,\n\n16:14.600 --> 16:16.360\n and others are friendly.\n\n16:16.360 --> 16:18.880\n And the ones that are friendly tend to be\n\n16:18.880 --> 16:20.200\n rather sympathetic characters,\n\n16:20.200 --> 16:24.120\n because they might be ones who are having problems\n\n16:24.120 --> 16:26.080\n in their own society.\n\n16:26.080 --> 16:29.360\n You know, so Joe Mio in Gombe used to come\n\n16:29.360 --> 16:31.640\n and sit next to me quite often,\n\n16:31.640 --> 16:35.720\n and he was having a hard time making it in that society,\n\n16:35.720 --> 16:38.080\n which I can describe to you in terms of the number\n\n16:38.080 --> 16:39.640\n of aggressive interactions, if you want, you know,\n\n16:39.640 --> 16:43.240\n but just to be informed about it.\n\n16:43.240 --> 16:48.240\n So all of this is a temptation to be very firmly resisted.\n\n16:49.080 --> 16:52.200\n And in the community that I've been working with in Uganda\n\n16:52.200 --> 16:56.000\n for the last 30 years, we try extremely hard to impress\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.320\n on all of the research students who come with us,\n\n16:58.320 --> 17:01.640\n that it is absolutely vital that you do not fall\n\n17:01.640 --> 17:02.680\n into that temptation.\n\n17:02.680 --> 17:05.800\n Now, you know, we heard a story of one person\n\n17:05.800 --> 17:09.040\n who did reach out and touch one of our chimps.\n\n17:09.040 --> 17:12.120\n It's a very, very bad idea.\n\n17:12.120 --> 17:16.280\n Not because the chimp is going to do anything violent\n\n17:16.280 --> 17:21.280\n at the time, but because if they learn that humans\n\n17:22.240 --> 17:25.960\n are as weak physically as we are compared to them,\n\n17:25.960 --> 17:28.680\n then they can take advantage of us.\n\n17:28.680 --> 17:30.680\n And that's what happened in Gombe.\n\n17:30.680 --> 17:35.280\n So after Jane had done the very obvious thing\n\n17:35.280 --> 17:38.720\n when you're first engaged in this game\n\n17:38.720 --> 17:41.520\n of allowing the infants to approach her\n\n17:41.520 --> 17:43.760\n and then tickling them and playing with them,\n\n17:45.440 --> 17:49.080\n some of those infants had the personality\n\n17:49.080 --> 17:53.280\n of wanting to take advantage of that knowledge later.\n\n17:53.280 --> 17:56.000\n And so, you know, you had an individual, Frodo,\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:59.880\n who was violent on a regular basis towards humans\n\n17:59.880 --> 18:01.600\n when he was an adult, and he was quite dangerous.\n\n18:01.600 --> 18:02.840\n I mean, he could easily have killed someone.\n\n18:02.840 --> 18:05.040\n In fact, he did kill one person.\n\n18:05.040 --> 18:09.640\n He killed a baby that he took from a mother,\n\n18:09.640 --> 18:11.920\n a human baby, that he took off her hip\n\n18:11.920 --> 18:13.760\n when he met her on the path.\n\n18:15.160 --> 18:20.160\n So it's a reminder that we're dealing with a species\n\n18:20.440 --> 18:23.840\n that are rather humanlike in the range of emotions\n\n18:23.840 --> 18:26.320\n they have, in the capacities they have,\n\n18:26.320 --> 18:28.880\n and even in the strength they have,\n\n18:28.880 --> 18:33.040\n they are in many ways stronger than humans.\n\n18:33.040 --> 18:37.080\n So you've got to be careful.\n\n18:37.080 --> 18:39.920\n So in the full range of friendliness and violence,\n\n18:39.920 --> 18:43.160\n the capacity for these very human things.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:47.280\n Yes, I mean, it's very obvious with violence,\n\n18:47.280 --> 18:50.160\n as we talked about, that they will kill.\n\n18:50.160 --> 18:52.000\n They will kill not just strangers.\n\n18:53.200 --> 18:57.600\n They can kill other adults within their own group.\n\n18:57.600 --> 18:59.600\n They can kill babies that are strangers.\n\n18:59.600 --> 19:01.160\n They can kill babies in their own group.\n\n19:01.160 --> 19:04.360\n So, you know, this is a long lived individual.\n\n19:04.360 --> 19:06.600\n Obviously, these killings can't have very often\n\n19:06.600 --> 19:08.400\n because otherwise they'd all be dead.\n\n19:09.320 --> 19:11.960\n And we're now finding that they can live\n\n19:11.960 --> 19:14.160\n to 50 or 60 years in the wild\n\n19:14.160 --> 19:16.160\n at relatively low population density\n\n19:16.160 --> 19:17.640\n because they're big animals eating\n\n19:17.640 --> 19:20.440\n a rather specialized kind of food, the ripe fruits.\n\n19:22.360 --> 19:23.880\n So it doesn't happen all the time.\n\n19:23.880 --> 19:27.760\n With friendliness, they are very strong\n\n19:27.760 --> 19:28.760\n to support each other.\n\n19:28.760 --> 19:33.760\n They very much depend on their close friendships,\n\n19:33.760 --> 19:38.760\n which they express through physical contact\n\n19:38.960 --> 19:41.640\n and particularly through grooming.\n\n19:41.640 --> 19:45.720\n So grooming occurs when one individual approaches another.\n\n19:45.720 --> 19:48.280\n I might present for grooming,\n\n19:48.280 --> 19:50.800\n a very common way of starting,\n\n19:50.800 --> 19:53.200\n turning their back or presenting an arm\n\n19:53.200 --> 19:54.520\n or something like that, and the other\n\n19:54.520 --> 19:56.960\n just riffles their fingers through the hair.\n\n19:57.840 --> 20:00.480\n And that's partly just soothing\n\n20:00.480 --> 20:04.360\n and it's partly looking for parasites,\n\n20:04.360 --> 20:06.400\n but mostly it's just soothing.\n\n20:06.400 --> 20:09.240\n And the point about this is it can go on\n\n20:09.240 --> 20:14.240\n for half an hour, it can go on for sometimes even an hour.\n\n20:15.440 --> 20:20.040\n So this is a major expression of interest in somebody else.\n\n20:21.280 --> 20:25.720\n When did your interest in this one particular aspect\n\n20:25.720 --> 20:28.920\n of Chim come to be, which is violence?\n\n20:28.920 --> 20:32.240\n When did the study of violence in chimps\n\n20:32.240 --> 20:34.440\n become something you're deeply interested in?\n\n20:35.760 --> 20:40.760\n Well, for my PhD in the early 1970s,\n\n20:41.480 --> 20:43.000\n I was in Gombe with Jane Goodall\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:46.160\n and was studying feeding behavior.\n\n20:46.160 --> 20:49.040\n But during that time, we were seeing,\n\n20:49.040 --> 20:52.400\n and I say we because there were half a dozen\n\n20:52.400 --> 20:55.800\n research students all in her camp,\n\n20:55.800 --> 20:58.800\n we were discovering that chimps\n\n20:58.800 --> 21:02.440\n had this capacity for violence.\n\n21:02.440 --> 21:05.000\n The first kill happened during that time,\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:07.600\n which was of an infant in a neighboring group.\n\n21:09.200 --> 21:12.880\n And we were starting to see these hunting expeditions.\n\n21:13.760 --> 21:16.360\n And this was the start of my interest\n\n21:16.360 --> 21:19.280\n because it was such chilling evidence\n\n21:19.280 --> 21:23.320\n of an extraordinary similarity between chimps\n\n21:23.320 --> 21:27.680\n and humans. Now, at that time,\n\n21:27.680 --> 21:31.280\n we didn't know very much about how chimpanzees\n\n21:31.280 --> 21:33.320\n and humans were related.\n\n21:33.320 --> 21:37.520\n Chimps, gorillas, bonobos are all three\n\n21:37.520 --> 21:40.840\n big black hairy things that live in the African forests\n\n21:40.840 --> 21:45.840\n and eat fruits and leaves when they can't find fruits\n\n21:46.080 --> 21:47.440\n and walk on their knuckles.\n\n21:47.440 --> 21:49.040\n And they all look rather similar to each other.\n\n21:49.040 --> 21:51.760\n So they seem as though they're very similar\n\n21:51.760 --> 21:54.800\n so they seem as though those three species,\n\n21:54.800 --> 21:56.680\n chimps and gorillas and bonobos,\n\n21:56.680 --> 21:59.360\n should all be each other's closest relatives\n\n21:59.360 --> 22:01.480\n and humans are something rather separate.\n\n22:01.480 --> 22:04.640\n And so any of them would be of interest to us.\n\n22:04.640 --> 22:08.520\n Subsequently, we learn that actually that's not true\n\n22:08.520 --> 22:10.400\n and that there's a special relationship\n\n22:10.400 --> 22:13.360\n between humans and chimpanzees.\n\n22:13.360 --> 22:15.920\n But at the time, even without knowing that,\n\n22:15.920 --> 22:18.440\n it was obvious that there was something very odd\n\n22:18.440 --> 22:22.760\n about chimpanzees because Jane had discovered\n\n22:22.760 --> 22:25.360\n they were making tools.\n\n22:25.360 --> 22:29.040\n She had seen that they were hunting meat.\n\n22:29.040 --> 22:31.720\n She had seen that they were sharing the meat\n\n22:31.720 --> 22:33.160\n among each other.\n\n22:33.160 --> 22:36.440\n She had seen that the societies were dominated politically\n\n22:36.440 --> 22:38.600\n by males, coalitions of males.\n\n22:38.600 --> 22:39.760\n All of these things, of course,\n\n22:39.760 --> 22:42.200\n resonate so closely with humans.\n\n22:43.120 --> 22:47.400\n And then it turns out that in contrast\n\n22:47.400 --> 22:50.080\n to conventional wisdom at the time,\n\n22:50.080 --> 22:53.200\n the chimpanzees were capable of hunting\n\n22:53.200 --> 22:55.280\n and killing members of neighboring groups.\n\n22:56.640 --> 23:00.400\n Well, at that point, the similarities\n\n23:00.400 --> 23:04.600\n between chimps and humans become less a matter\n\n23:04.600 --> 23:09.160\n of sort of sheer intellectual fascination\n\n23:09.160 --> 23:11.520\n than something that has a really deep meaning\n\n23:11.520 --> 23:14.600\n about our understanding of ourselves.\n\n23:14.600 --> 23:18.720\n I mean, until then, you can cheerfully think of humans\n\n23:18.720 --> 23:21.840\n as a species apart from the rest of nature\n\n23:21.840 --> 23:23.680\n because we are so peculiar.\n\n23:23.680 --> 23:27.400\n But when it turns out that, as it turns out,\n\n23:27.400 --> 23:29.040\n one of our two closest relatives\n\n23:30.840 --> 23:33.840\n has got these features that we share\n\n23:33.840 --> 23:36.680\n and that one of the features is something\n\n23:36.680 --> 23:39.960\n that is the most horrendous,\n\n23:39.960 --> 23:43.600\n as well as fascinating, aspect of human behavior,\n\n23:43.600 --> 23:47.040\n then how can you resist just trying\n\n23:47.040 --> 23:49.080\n to find out what's going on?\n\n23:49.080 --> 23:50.760\n So I have to say this.\n\n23:50.760 --> 23:53.600\n I'm not sure if you're familiar with a man,\n\n23:53.600 --> 23:55.520\n but fans of this podcast are.\n\n23:55.520 --> 23:59.200\n So we're talking about chimps, we're talking about violence.\n\n23:59.200 --> 24:02.120\n My now friend, Mr. Joe Rogan,\n\n24:02.120 --> 24:03.560\n is a big fan of those things.\n\n24:03.560 --> 24:05.440\n I'm a big fan of these topics.\n\n24:05.440 --> 24:09.400\n I think a lot of people are fascinated by these topics.\n\n24:09.400 --> 24:14.400\n So as you're saying, why do we find\n\n24:15.200 --> 24:17.560\n the exploration of violence\n\n24:17.560 --> 24:20.880\n and the relations between chimps so interesting?\n\n24:20.880 --> 24:23.940\n What can they teach us about ourselves?\n\n24:26.160 --> 24:29.760\n Until we had this information about chimpanzees,\n\n24:29.760 --> 24:34.760\n it was possible to believe that the psychology\n\n24:34.760 --> 24:39.760\n behind warfare was totally the result\n\n24:43.640 --> 24:48.640\n of some kind of recent cultural innovation.\n\n24:49.520 --> 24:51.360\n It had nothing to do with our biology.\n\n24:52.560 --> 24:54.240\n Or if you like, that it's got something to do\n\n24:54.240 --> 24:59.240\n with sin and God and the devil and that sort of thing.\n\n24:59.240 --> 25:04.240\n But what the chimps tell us after we think carefully\n\n25:07.120 --> 25:11.720\n about it is that it seems undoubtedly the case\n\n25:11.720 --> 25:16.720\n that our evolutionary psychology has given us\n\n25:18.480 --> 25:22.680\n the same kind of attitude towards violence\n\n25:22.680 --> 25:27.680\n as has occurred in chimpanzees and in both species.\n\n25:27.680 --> 25:32.080\n It has evolved because of its evolutionary significance.\n\n25:32.080 --> 25:34.600\n In other words, because it's been helpful\n\n25:34.600 --> 25:37.920\n to the individuals who have practiced it.\n\n25:37.920 --> 25:41.880\n And now we know that, as I mentioned,\n\n25:41.880 --> 25:44.120\n other species do this as well.\n\n25:44.120 --> 25:49.120\n In fact, wolves, which this is a really kind of\n\n25:50.160 --> 25:54.960\n ironical observation, Conrad Lorentz, who I mentioned\n\n25:54.960 --> 25:59.640\n had been the person who thought that human aggression\n\n25:59.640 --> 26:02.000\n in the form of killing members of our own species\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:05.600\n was unique to our species, he was a great fan of wolves.\n\n26:05.600 --> 26:07.000\n He studied wolves.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:11.000\n And in captivity, he noted that wolves are very unlikely\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:16.000\n to harm each other in spats among members of the same group.\n\n26:17.440 --> 26:19.160\n What happens is that one of them will roll over\n\n26:19.160 --> 26:21.400\n and present their neck, much as you see in a dog park\n\n26:21.400 --> 26:25.680\n nowadays, and the other might put their jaws on the neck\n\n26:25.680 --> 26:26.640\n but will not bite.\n\n26:27.800 --> 26:30.280\n Okay, so now it turns out that if you study wolves\n\n26:30.280 --> 26:35.240\n in the wild, then neighboring packs often go hunting\n\n26:35.240 --> 26:39.320\n for each other, they are in fierce competition,\n\n26:39.320 --> 26:43.680\n and as much as 50% of the mortality of wolves\n\n26:43.680 --> 26:47.520\n is due to being killed by other wolves, adult mortality.\n\n26:47.520 --> 26:48.360\n Wow.\n\n26:48.360 --> 26:50.200\n So it's a really serious business.\n\n26:50.200 --> 26:54.440\n The chimpanzees and humans fit into a larger pattern\n\n26:54.440 --> 26:59.440\n of understanding animals in which you don't have\n\n26:59.440 --> 27:03.400\n an instinct for violence, what you have is an instinct,\n\n27:03.400 --> 27:06.840\n if you like, to use violence adaptively.\n\n27:06.840 --> 27:10.760\n And if the right circumstances come up, it'll be adaptive,\n\n27:10.760 --> 27:13.880\n if the right circumstances don't come up, it won't be.\n\n27:13.880 --> 27:17.440\n So some chimpanzee communities are much more violent\n\n27:17.440 --> 27:21.280\n than others because of things like the frequency\n\n27:21.280 --> 27:25.400\n with which a large party of males is likely to meet\n\n27:25.400 --> 27:28.000\n a lone victim, and that's going to depend\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.480\n on the local ecology.\n\n27:31.040 --> 27:34.880\n But, you know, so the overall answer to the question\n\n27:34.880 --> 27:38.400\n of what do chimps teach us is that we have to take\n\n27:38.400 --> 27:42.400\n very seriously the notion that in humans,\n\n27:42.400 --> 27:47.080\n the tendency to make war is a consequence\n\n27:47.080 --> 27:50.480\n of a long term evolutionary adaptation\n\n27:50.480 --> 27:53.040\n and not just a military ideology\n\n27:53.040 --> 27:57.040\n or some sort of local patriarchal phenomenon.\n\n27:58.320 --> 28:01.000\n And of course, you know, a reading of history,\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:05.120\n a judicious reading of history fits that very easily\n\n28:05.120 --> 28:07.760\n because war is so commonplace.\n\n28:08.760 --> 28:11.080\n It's not an accident, so it's not a constraint.\n\n28:11.080 --> 28:12.720\n It's not an accident, so it's not a construction\n\n28:12.720 --> 28:14.560\n of human civilization.\n\n28:14.560 --> 28:17.520\n It's deeply within us, violence.\n\n28:17.520 --> 28:20.440\n So what's the difference between violence\n\n28:20.440 --> 28:24.640\n on the individual level versus group is,\n\n28:24.640 --> 28:26.880\n it seems like with chimps and with wolves,\n\n28:26.880 --> 28:30.760\n there's something about the dynamic of multiple\n\n28:32.280 --> 28:36.280\n chimps together that increase the chance of violence.\n\n28:36.280 --> 28:41.000\n Or is violence still fundamentally part of the individual?\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:45.000\n Like would an individual be as violent\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.960\n as they might be as part of a group?\n\n28:47.960 --> 28:50.240\n If we're talking about killing,\n\n28:51.200 --> 28:54.200\n then violence in the sense of killing\n\n28:54.200 --> 28:59.000\n is very much associated with a group.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:03.920\n And the reason is that individuals don't benefit\n\n29:03.920 --> 29:05.560\n by getting into a fight\n\n29:05.560 --> 29:08.680\n in which they risk being hurt themselves.\n\n29:08.680 --> 29:12.640\n So it's only when you have overwhelming power\n\n29:12.640 --> 29:16.760\n that the temptation to try and kill another victim\n\n29:16.760 --> 29:20.640\n rises sufficiently for them to be motivated to do it.\n\n29:23.360 --> 29:27.840\n The average number of chimpanzee males\n\n29:27.840 --> 29:30.480\n that attack a single male\n\n29:30.480 --> 29:33.160\n in something like 50 observations\n\n29:33.160 --> 29:36.000\n that have accumulated in the last 50 years\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.400\n from various different study sites\n\n29:38.400 --> 29:41.080\n is eight, eight to one.\n\n29:41.920 --> 29:46.800\n Now, sometimes it can go as low as three to one,\n\n29:46.800 --> 29:49.440\n but that's getting risky.\n\n29:49.440 --> 29:51.640\n But if you have eight, you can see what can happen.\n\n29:51.640 --> 29:55.880\n I mean, basically you have one male on one foot,\n\n29:55.880 --> 29:58.080\n another male on another foot, another male on an arm,\n\n29:58.080 --> 29:59.640\n another male on another arm.\n\n29:59.640 --> 30:02.480\n Now you have an immobilized victim\n\n30:02.480 --> 30:06.320\n with four individuals capable of just doing the damage.\n\n30:06.320 --> 30:08.680\n And so they can then move in and tear out his thorax\n\n30:08.680 --> 30:10.160\n and tear off his testicles\n\n30:10.160 --> 30:12.560\n and twist an arm until it breaks\n\n30:12.560 --> 30:16.720\n and do this appalling damage with no weapons.\n\n30:18.440 --> 30:23.440\n What is the way in which they prefer to commit the violence?\n\n30:23.640 --> 30:24.880\n Is there something to be said\n\n30:24.880 --> 30:27.800\n about the actual process of it?\n\n30:27.800 --> 30:29.360\n Is there an artistry to it?\n\n30:29.360 --> 30:32.400\n So if you look at human warfare,\n\n30:32.400 --> 30:34.200\n there's different parts in history\n\n30:34.200 --> 30:37.800\n prefer different kind of approaches to violence.\n\n30:37.800 --> 30:41.240\n It had more to do with tools, I think, on the human side.\n\n30:41.240 --> 30:44.760\n But just the nature of violence itself,\n\n30:44.760 --> 30:47.520\n sorry, the practice, the strategy of violence,\n\n30:47.520 --> 30:49.080\n is it basically the same?\n\n30:49.080 --> 30:53.400\n You improvise, you immobilize the victim,\n\n30:53.400 --> 30:54.960\n and they just rip off different parts\n\n30:54.960 --> 30:56.760\n of their body kind of thing?\n\n30:56.760 --> 30:58.200\n Yeah, you have to understand\n\n30:58.200 --> 31:01.640\n that these things are happening at high speed\n\n31:01.640 --> 31:04.640\n in thick vegetation, mostly,\n\n31:04.640 --> 31:08.640\n so that they have not been filmed carefully.\n\n31:08.640 --> 31:12.320\n We have a few little glimpses of them\n\n31:12.320 --> 31:15.200\n from one or two people like David Watts,\n\n31:15.200 --> 31:16.400\n who's got some great video,\n\n31:16.400 --> 31:19.840\n but we don't know enough to be able to say that.\n\n31:19.840 --> 31:22.320\n It's hard for me to imagine that there are styles\n\n31:22.320 --> 31:26.880\n that vary between communities, cultural styles,\n\n31:26.880 --> 31:28.920\n but it is possible.\n\n31:28.920 --> 31:32.720\n It is possible, and one thing that is striking\n\n31:32.720 --> 31:37.000\n is that the number of times that an individual victim\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:41.200\n has been killed immediately has been higher\n\n31:41.200 --> 31:45.040\n in Kibale forest in Uganda\n\n31:45.040 --> 31:48.480\n than in Gombe National Park in Tanzania.\n\n31:48.480 --> 31:50.000\n It's conceivable that's just chance.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:54.160\n We don't have real numbers now, but what is this?\n\n31:54.160 --> 31:55.240\n I can't remember the exact numbers,\n\n31:55.240 --> 32:00.240\n but 10 versus 15 or something.\n\n32:00.240 --> 32:04.240\n So maybe they damaged to the point\n\n32:04.240 --> 32:07.080\n of expecting a death in one place\n\n32:07.080 --> 32:08.960\n and they just finished it off in the other,\n\n32:08.960 --> 32:11.920\n but most likely that sort of difference\n\n32:11.920 --> 32:16.920\n will be due to differences in the numbers of attackers.\n\n32:16.960 --> 32:19.720\n You know, human beings are able to conceive\n\n32:19.720 --> 32:23.200\n of the philosophical notion of death, of mortality.\n\n32:23.200 --> 32:27.280\n Is there any of that for chimps\n\n32:28.360 --> 32:30.320\n when they're thinking about violence?\n\n32:30.320 --> 32:33.360\n Is violence, like what is the nature\n\n32:33.360 --> 32:36.360\n of their conception of violence, do you think?\n\n32:36.360 --> 32:41.360\n Do they realize they're taking another conscious being's life\n\n32:41.440 --> 32:45.760\n or is it some kind of like optimization\n\n32:45.760 --> 32:48.360\n over the use of resources or something like that?\n\n32:48.360 --> 32:53.280\n I don't think it's, I can't think of any way\n\n32:53.280 --> 32:55.120\n to get an answer to the question\n\n32:55.120 --> 32:56.680\n of what they know about that.\n\n32:58.080 --> 33:03.080\n I think that the way to think about the motivation\n\n33:03.240 --> 33:08.240\n is rather like the motivation in sex.\n\n33:09.800 --> 33:14.560\n So when males are interested in having sex with a female,\n\n33:14.560 --> 33:18.800\n whether it's in chimpanzees or in humans,\n\n33:18.800 --> 33:20.240\n they don't think about the fact\n\n33:20.240 --> 33:25.200\n that what this is going to do is to lead to a baby, mostly.\n\n33:25.200 --> 33:26.040\n You're right.\n\n33:26.040 --> 33:27.520\n Mostly what they're thinking about is,\n\n33:27.520 --> 33:28.760\n I wanna get my end away.\n\n33:29.840 --> 33:34.440\n And I think that it's a similar kind of process\n\n33:34.440 --> 33:35.720\n with the chimps.\n\n33:35.720 --> 33:37.640\n What they are thinking about is,\n\n33:38.640 --> 33:41.600\n I wanna kill this individual.\n\n33:41.600 --> 33:45.520\n And it's hard to imagine that taking\n\n33:45.520 --> 33:47.560\n the other individual's perspective\n\n33:47.560 --> 33:50.160\n and thinking about what it means for them to die\n\n33:50.160 --> 33:51.720\n is gonna be an important part of that.\n\n33:51.720 --> 33:53.720\n In fact, there's reasons to think\n\n33:53.720 --> 33:55.080\n it should not be an important part of it\n\n33:55.080 --> 33:56.040\n because it might inhibit them\n\n33:56.040 --> 33:57.920\n and they don't want to be inhibited.\n\n33:57.920 --> 34:01.640\n The more efficient they are in doing this, the better.\n\n34:01.640 --> 34:03.440\n But I think it's interesting to think about\n\n34:03.440 --> 34:04.680\n this whole motivational question\n\n34:04.680 --> 34:09.680\n because it does produce this rather haunting thought\n\n34:09.680 --> 34:11.640\n that there has been selection\n\n34:11.640 --> 34:15.480\n in favor of enthusiasm about killing.\n\n34:16.920 --> 34:21.920\n And in our relatively gentle\n\n34:21.920 --> 34:26.480\n and deliberately moral society that we have today,\n\n34:26.480 --> 34:28.920\n it's very difficult for us to face the thought\n\n34:28.920 --> 34:32.400\n that in all of us,\n\n34:32.400 --> 34:37.160\n there might've been residue\n\n34:37.160 --> 34:42.160\n and more than that, sort of an active potential\n\n34:42.160 --> 34:46.480\n for that thought of really enjoying killing someone else.\n\n34:47.520 --> 34:52.520\n But I think one can sustain that thought fairly obviously\n\n34:52.520 --> 34:56.840\n by thinking of circumstances in which it would be true\n\n34:57.840 --> 35:02.840\n that the ordinary human male would be delighted\n\n35:03.480 --> 35:06.520\n to be part of a group that was killing someone.\n\n35:06.520 --> 35:10.360\n What you've got to do is to be in a position\n\n35:10.360 --> 35:12.520\n where you're regarding the victim\n\n35:12.520 --> 35:16.360\n as dangerous and thoroughly hostile.\n\n35:17.560 --> 35:21.000\n But the pure enjoyment of violence.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.880\n There's, I don't know if you know this historian,\n\n35:23.880 --> 35:25.920\n Dan Carlin, he has a podcast.\n\n35:25.920 --> 35:30.920\n He has an episode, three, four hour episode\n\n35:32.040 --> 35:33.200\n that I recommend to others.\n\n35:33.200 --> 35:34.880\n It's quite haunting.\n\n35:34.880 --> 35:38.280\n But he takes us through an entire history.\n\n35:38.280 --> 35:40.720\n It's called painfotainment.\n\n35:40.720 --> 35:44.480\n The history of humans\n\n35:45.360 --> 35:48.840\n enjoying the murder of others in a large group.\n\n35:48.840 --> 35:53.560\n So like public executions were long part of human history.\n\n35:53.560 --> 35:58.200\n And there's something that for some reason,\n\n35:58.200 --> 36:03.200\n humans seem to have been drawn to just watching others die.\n\n36:03.200 --> 36:06.640\n And he ventures to say that that may still be part of us.\n\n36:06.640 --> 36:11.240\n For example, he said if it was possible to televise,\n\n36:11.240 --> 36:13.120\n to stream online for example,\n\n36:13.120 --> 36:15.800\n the execution and the murder of somebody\n\n36:15.800 --> 36:17.840\n or even the torture of somebody,\n\n36:17.840 --> 36:22.840\n that a very large fraction of the population on earth\n\n36:23.080 --> 36:24.840\n would not be able to look away.\n\n36:24.840 --> 36:26.600\n They'd be drawn to that somehow.\n\n36:26.600 --> 36:31.560\n As a very dark thought that we were drawn to that.\n\n36:31.560 --> 36:33.840\n So you think that's part of us in there somewhere.\n\n36:33.840 --> 36:38.840\n That selection that we evolved for the enjoyment of killing\n\n36:39.160 --> 36:41.800\n and the enjoyment of observing\n\n36:44.120 --> 36:47.280\n those in our tribe doing the killing.\n\n36:48.120 --> 36:51.000\n Yes, I mean, and that word you produced at the end\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:52.520\n is critical I think.\n\n36:52.520 --> 36:57.320\n Because it would be a little bit weird I think\n\n36:57.320 --> 37:01.920\n to imagine a lot of enjoyment about people\n\n37:01.920 --> 37:04.240\n in your own tribe being killed.\n\n37:04.240 --> 37:06.240\n I don't think we're interested in violence\n\n37:06.240 --> 37:08.240\n for violence's sake that much.\n\n37:09.640 --> 37:14.640\n It's when you get these social boundaries set up.\n\n37:15.200 --> 37:19.240\n And in today's world, happily,\n\n37:20.640 --> 37:23.800\n we kind of are already one world.\n\n37:23.800 --> 37:28.800\n You have to dehumanize someone to get to the point\n\n37:29.160 --> 37:34.160\n where they are really outside our recognition of a tribe\n\n37:34.160 --> 37:37.360\n at some level, which is the whole human species.\n\n37:37.360 --> 37:41.120\n But in ancient times, that would not have been true.\n\n37:41.120 --> 37:42.600\n Because in ancient times,\n\n37:43.880 --> 37:47.240\n there are lots of accounts of hunters and gatherers\n\n37:47.240 --> 37:50.360\n in which the appearance of a stranger\n\n37:50.360 --> 37:55.360\n would lead to an immediate response of shooting on sight.\n\n37:56.280 --> 37:59.240\n Because what was human was the people\n\n37:59.240 --> 38:01.960\n that were in your society.\n\n38:01.960 --> 38:04.840\n And the other things that actually looked like us\n\n38:04.840 --> 38:08.520\n and were human in that sense, were not regarded as human.\n\n38:09.400 --> 38:12.360\n So there was a kind of automatic dehumanization\n\n38:12.360 --> 38:14.920\n of everybody that didn't speak our language\n\n38:14.920 --> 38:19.200\n or hadn't already somehow become recognized\n\n38:19.200 --> 38:24.200\n as sufficiently like us to escape\n\n38:25.280 --> 38:27.760\n the dehumanization contact.\n\n38:27.760 --> 38:29.960\n And so hopefully the story of human history\n\n38:29.960 --> 38:34.960\n is that tribalism fades away,\n\n38:35.240 --> 38:39.120\n that our dehumanization, the natural desire to dehumanize\n\n38:39.120 --> 38:42.280\n or tendency to dehumanize groups\n\n38:42.280 --> 38:45.800\n that are not within this tribe, decreases over time.\n\n38:45.800 --> 38:49.760\n And so then the desire for violence decreases over time.\n\n38:49.760 --> 38:52.520\n Yeah, I mean, that's the optimistic perspective.\n\n38:52.520 --> 38:56.240\n And the great sort of concern, of course,\n\n38:56.240 --> 39:00.360\n is that small conflicts can build up into bigger conflicts\n\n39:00.360 --> 39:02.120\n and then dehumanization happens\n\n39:02.120 --> 39:03.680\n and then violence is released.\n\n39:04.760 --> 39:06.280\n As Hannah Arendt says,\n\n39:06.280 --> 39:10.120\n there currently is no known alternative to war\n\n39:10.120 --> 39:15.120\n as a means of settling really important conflicts.\n\n39:16.520 --> 39:18.720\n So if we look at the big picture,\n\n39:18.720 --> 39:21.960\n what role has violence or do you think violence\n\n39:21.960 --> 39:24.960\n has played in the evolution of Homo sapiens?\n\n39:24.960 --> 39:29.640\n So we are quite an intelligent, quite a beautiful,\n\n39:29.640 --> 39:32.920\n particular little branch on the evolutionary tree.\n\n39:32.920 --> 39:39.920\n What part of that was played by our tendency to be violent?\n\n39:41.760 --> 39:43.880\n Well, I think that violence was responsible\n\n39:43.880 --> 39:46.120\n for creating your Homo sapiens.\n\n39:49.280 --> 39:54.280\n And that raises the question of what Homo sapiens is.\n\n39:55.160 --> 39:56.000\n Yes.\n\n39:57.240 --> 39:58.720\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n39:58.720 --> 40:03.720\n So nowadays people begin the concept\n\n40:06.640 --> 40:10.800\n of what Homo sapiens is by thinking about features\n\n40:10.800 --> 40:12.360\n that are very obviously different\n\n40:12.360 --> 40:14.680\n from all of the other species of Homo.\n\n40:15.720 --> 40:20.720\n And our large brain, our very rounded cranium,\n\n40:21.160 --> 40:24.240\n our relatively small face, these are characteristics\n\n40:24.240 --> 40:27.720\n which are developed in a relatively modern way\n\n40:27.720 --> 40:31.120\n by about 170,000 years ago.\n\n40:31.120 --> 40:33.960\n So that's one of the earliest skulls in Africa\n\n40:33.960 --> 40:36.560\n that really captures that.\n\n40:36.560 --> 40:41.560\n But it has been argued that that is an episode\n\n40:44.280 --> 40:49.280\n in a process that has been started substantially earlier.\n\n40:50.240 --> 40:52.200\n And there's no doubt that that's true.\n\n40:52.200 --> 40:55.080\n Homo sapiens is a species that has been changing\n\n40:55.080 --> 41:00.080\n pretty continuously throughout the length of time it's there.\n\n41:00.280 --> 41:03.360\n And it goes back to 300,000 years ago,\n\n41:03.360 --> 41:08.360\n 315 literally is the time, the best estimate of a date\n\n41:08.560 --> 41:11.920\n for a series of bones from Morocco\n\n41:13.120 --> 41:16.880\n that have been dated three or four years ago at that time\n\n41:16.880 --> 41:21.400\n and have been characterized as earliest Homo sapiens.\n\n41:21.400 --> 41:25.600\n Now at that point, they are only beginning\n\n41:25.600 --> 41:27.760\n the trend of sapionization.\n\n41:27.760 --> 41:31.760\n And that trend consists basically of gracilization\n\n41:31.760 --> 41:35.680\n of making our ancestors less robust,\n\n41:36.960 --> 41:40.680\n shorter faces, smaller teeth, smaller brow ridge,\n\n41:40.680 --> 41:45.440\n narrower face, thinner cranium,\n\n41:45.440 --> 41:51.440\n all these things that are associated with reduced violence.\n\n41:51.840 --> 41:54.240\n Okay, so that's saying what,\n\n41:54.240 --> 41:56.120\n that's Homo sapiens beginning.\n\n41:56.120 --> 41:59.600\n So it began sometime three to 400,000 years ago\n\n41:59.600 --> 42:01.560\n because by 315,000 years ago,\n\n42:01.560 --> 42:03.320\n you've already got something recognizable.\n\n42:03.320 --> 42:05.160\n So you're more on that side of things\n\n42:05.160 --> 42:06.680\n that those are this gradual process.\n\n42:06.680 --> 42:09.200\n It's not 150, 170,000 years ago.\n\n42:09.200 --> 42:14.200\n It started like 400,000 years ago and it's just.\n\n42:14.200 --> 42:16.160\n It started three to 400,000 years ago\n\n42:16.160 --> 42:19.680\n and if you look at 170, it's got even more like us.\n\n42:19.680 --> 42:23.320\n And then if you look at 100, it's got more like us again.\n\n42:23.320 --> 42:25.160\n And if you look at 50, it's more like us again.\n\n42:25.160 --> 42:26.720\n It's all the way, it's just getting\n\n42:26.720 --> 42:28.880\n more and more like the moderns.\n\n42:28.880 --> 42:30.520\n So the question is what happened\n\n42:30.520 --> 42:32.320\n between three and 400,000 years ago\n\n42:32.320 --> 42:34.440\n to produce Homo sapiens?\n\n42:34.440 --> 42:37.840\n And I think we have a pretty good answer now.\n\n42:37.840 --> 42:39.880\n And the answer comes from violence.\n\n42:39.880 --> 42:43.840\n And the story begins by focusing on this question.\n\n42:43.840 --> 42:48.840\n Why is it that in the human species,\n\n42:48.880 --> 42:51.320\n we are unique among all primates\n\n42:51.320 --> 42:55.360\n in not having an alpha male in any group\n\n42:56.760 --> 42:59.400\n in the sense that what we don't have\n\n42:59.400 --> 43:03.600\n is an alpha male who personally beats up every other male?\n\n43:05.040 --> 43:10.040\n And the answer that has been portrayed most richly\n\n43:10.040 --> 43:15.040\n by Christopher Boehm and whose work I've elaborated on\n\n43:15.040 --> 43:20.040\n is that only in humans do you have a system\n\n43:21.080 --> 43:26.080\n by which any male who tries to bully others\n\n43:26.320 --> 43:29.720\n and become the alpha equivalent to an alpha gorilla\n\n43:29.720 --> 43:31.720\n or an alpha chimpanzee or an alpha bonobo\n\n43:31.720 --> 43:33.960\n or an alpha baboon or anything like that,\n\n43:33.960 --> 43:36.600\n any male who tries to do that in humans\n\n43:36.600 --> 43:40.920\n gets taken down by a coalition of beta males.\n\n43:40.920 --> 43:43.920\n That coalition.\n\n43:43.920 --> 43:46.920\n That's a really good picture of human society, yes.\n\n43:46.920 --> 43:47.760\n I like it.\n\n43:47.760 --> 43:50.760\n Okay, and that's the way all our societies work now.\n\n43:50.760 --> 43:51.600\n Yes.\n\n43:51.600 --> 43:53.680\n Because individuals try and be alpha\n\n43:53.680 --> 43:55.040\n and then they get taken out.\n\n43:55.040 --> 43:57.080\n Yeah, I mean, we don't usually think of ourselves\n\n43:57.080 --> 44:01.360\n as beta males, but yes, I suppose that's what democracy is.\n\n44:01.360 --> 44:02.200\n Exactly.\n\n44:02.200 --> 44:04.120\n And that's the way we think of ourselves.\n\n44:04.120 --> 44:06.600\n I suppose that's what democracy is.\n\n44:06.600 --> 44:07.440\n Exactly.\n\n44:07.440 --> 44:08.280\n Yes.\n\n44:08.280 --> 44:09.120\n Exactly.\n\n44:09.120 --> 44:14.120\n Okay, so at some point alpha males get taken out.\n\n44:14.680 --> 44:16.920\n Well, what alpha males are are males\n\n44:16.920 --> 44:20.720\n who respond with high reactive violence\n\n44:20.720 --> 44:22.840\n to any challenge to their status.\n\n44:22.840 --> 44:25.160\n You see it all the time in primates.\n\n44:25.160 --> 44:28.120\n Some beta male thinks he's getting strong\n\n44:28.120 --> 44:31.800\n and maturing in wisdom and so on,\n\n44:31.800 --> 44:35.960\n and he refuses to kowtow to the alpha male.\n\n44:35.960 --> 44:39.440\n And the alpha male comes straight in and charges at him.\n\n44:39.440 --> 44:42.240\n Or maybe he'll just wait for a few minutes\n\n44:42.240 --> 44:44.440\n and then take an opportunity to attack him.\n\n44:48.720 --> 44:51.440\n All of these primates have got a high tendency\n\n44:51.440 --> 44:53.320\n for reactive aggression,\n\n44:53.320 --> 44:56.520\n and that enables the possibility of alpha males.\n\n44:56.520 --> 44:57.360\n We don't.\n\n44:57.360 --> 45:00.520\n We have this great reduction, as I talked about earlier.\n\n45:00.520 --> 45:03.160\n And the question is, when did that reduction happen?\n\n45:04.040 --> 45:08.560\n Well, cut to the famous experiments\n\n45:08.560 --> 45:12.320\n by the Russian biologist Dmitry Belyaev,\n\n45:12.320 --> 45:16.320\n who tried domesticating wild animals.\n\n45:17.600 --> 45:19.960\n When you domesticate wild animals,\n\n45:19.960 --> 45:23.760\n what you're doing is reducing reactive aggression.\n\n45:24.680 --> 45:28.280\n You are selecting those individuals to breed\n\n45:28.280 --> 45:32.000\n who are most willing to be approached by a human\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:34.400\n or by another member of their own species\n\n45:34.400 --> 45:39.400\n and are least likely to erupt in reactive aggression.\n\n45:40.040 --> 45:42.960\n And you only have to do that for a few generations\n\n45:42.960 --> 45:47.120\n to discover that there are changes in the skull.\n\n45:47.120 --> 45:52.120\n And those changes consist of shorter face, smaller teeth,\n\n45:52.120 --> 45:54.200\n reduced maleness,\n\n45:54.200 --> 45:56.720\n the males become increasingly female like,\n\n45:58.120 --> 45:59.720\n and reduced brain size.\n\n46:01.320 --> 46:03.320\n Well, the changes that are characteristic\n\n46:03.320 --> 46:05.240\n of domesticated animals in general\n\n46:05.240 --> 46:08.760\n compared to wild animals are all found in Homo sapiens\n\n46:08.760 --> 46:11.520\n compared to our early ancestors.\n\n46:11.520 --> 46:13.240\n So it's a very strong signal\n\n46:13.240 --> 46:15.920\n that when we first see Homo sapiens,\n\n46:15.920 --> 46:18.520\n what we're seeing is that there's a lot of change\n\n46:18.520 --> 46:20.560\n in the shape of the animal.\n\n46:20.560 --> 46:22.920\n What we're seeing is evidence\n\n46:22.920 --> 46:26.200\n of a reduction in reactive aggression.\n\n46:26.200 --> 46:29.320\n And that suggests that what's happening with Homo sapiens\n\n46:29.320 --> 46:32.040\n is that that is the point\n\n46:32.040 --> 46:35.440\n at which there is selection against the alpha males.\n\n46:35.440 --> 46:39.280\n And therefore, the way in which the selection happened\n\n46:39.280 --> 46:41.440\n would have been the way it happens today.\n\n46:41.440 --> 46:42.880\n The beta males take them out.\n\n46:44.160 --> 46:47.480\n So I think that Homo sapiens is a species\n\n46:47.480 --> 46:52.400\n characterized by the suppression of reactive aggression\n\n46:53.280 --> 46:55.320\n as a kind of incidental consequence\n\n46:55.320 --> 46:58.480\n of the suppression of the alpha male.\n\n46:58.480 --> 47:00.760\n And the story of our species\n\n47:00.760 --> 47:04.040\n is the story of how the beta males took charge\n\n47:05.720 --> 47:10.200\n and have been responsible for the generation\n\n47:10.200 --> 47:11.960\n of a new kind of human.\n\n47:11.960 --> 47:16.960\n And incidentally, for imposing on the society\n\n47:20.120 --> 47:23.160\n a new set of values.\n\n47:23.160 --> 47:25.640\n Because when those beta males discovered\n\n47:25.640 --> 47:28.760\n that they could take out the previous alpha male\n\n47:28.760 --> 47:29.880\n and continue to do so,\n\n47:29.880 --> 47:32.080\n because in every generation there'll always be some male\n\n47:32.080 --> 47:35.200\n who says, maybe I'll become the alpha male.\n\n47:35.200 --> 47:37.200\n So they just keep chopping them down.\n\n47:38.560 --> 47:41.400\n In discovering that, they also obviously discovered\n\n47:41.400 --> 47:43.400\n that they could kill anybody in the group.\n\n47:43.400 --> 47:44.240\n Mm hmm.\n\n47:44.240 --> 47:49.240\n Females, young males, anybody who didn't follow their values.\n\n47:51.960 --> 47:56.960\n And so this story is one in which the males of our species,\n\n47:58.560 --> 48:00.400\n and these would be the breeding males,\n\n48:01.920 --> 48:05.800\n have been able to impose their values on everybody else.\n\n48:05.800 --> 48:07.000\n And there is two kind of values.\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:08.560\n There's one kind of value is things\n\n48:08.560 --> 48:09.560\n that are good for the group.\n\n48:09.560 --> 48:11.480\n Like, thou shalt not murder.\n\n48:11.480 --> 48:12.920\n Mm hmm.\n\n48:12.920 --> 48:15.080\n And the other kind of value is things\n\n48:15.080 --> 48:17.080\n that are good for the males.\n\n48:18.480 --> 48:20.240\n Such as, hey, guess what?\n\n48:20.240 --> 48:22.480\n When good food comes in, males get it first.\n\n48:22.480 --> 48:23.320\n Yes.\n\n48:24.520 --> 48:27.520\n I mean, it's fascinating that that kind of set of ideals\n\n48:27.520 --> 48:30.920\n could outcompete the others.\n\n48:32.040 --> 48:34.400\n Do you have a sense of why,\n\n48:34.400 --> 48:36.400\n or maybe you can comment on Neanderthals\n\n48:36.400 --> 48:38.240\n and all the other early humans.\n\n48:38.240 --> 48:43.240\n Why did Homo sapiens come to succeed and flourish\n\n48:43.240 --> 48:44.680\n and all the other ones,\n\n48:44.680 --> 48:48.000\n all the other branches of evolution died out?\n\n48:49.600 --> 48:50.440\n Or got murdered out.\n\n48:50.440 --> 48:55.040\n I mean, nowadays, when Homo sapiens meets Homo sapiens,\n\n48:55.040 --> 48:58.120\n and we don't know each other initially,\n\n48:58.120 --> 48:59.640\n then conflict breaks out\n\n48:59.640 --> 49:04.640\n and the more militarily able group wins.\n\n49:04.640 --> 49:07.720\n We've seen that everywhere throughout the age\n\n49:07.720 --> 49:11.120\n of exploration and throughout history.\n\n49:12.160 --> 49:13.880\n So I'm rather surprised.\n\n49:13.880 --> 49:18.280\n The conventional wisdom that you see nowadays\n\n49:18.280 --> 49:22.200\n in contemporary anthropology is very reluctant\n\n49:22.200 --> 49:25.840\n to point to success in warfare\n\n49:25.840 --> 49:30.280\n as the reason why sapiens wiped out Neanderthals\n\n49:30.280 --> 49:33.560\n within about 3000 years of the sapiens.\n\n49:33.560 --> 49:36.880\n Coming into Europe 43,000 years ago.\n\n49:37.920 --> 49:40.440\n And people are much more inclined to say,\n\n49:40.440 --> 49:43.440\n well, the Neanderthals were at low population density,\n\n49:43.440 --> 49:48.440\n so they just couldn't survive the demographic sort of sweep\n\n49:49.800 --> 49:52.160\n or the disease came in.\n\n49:52.160 --> 49:54.680\n And maybe those things might've been important,\n\n49:54.680 --> 49:58.200\n but far and away, the most obvious possibility\n\n49:58.200 --> 50:02.120\n is that sapiens were just,\n\n50:02.120 --> 50:06.720\n sapiens were just powerful.\n\n50:06.720 --> 50:09.360\n They had, everyone agrees they had larger groups.\n\n50:10.360 --> 50:11.600\n They had better weapons.\n\n50:12.560 --> 50:15.840\n They had projectile weapons, bows and arrows,\n\n50:15.840 --> 50:20.200\n to judge from the little microlith bits of flake,\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:23.520\n which the Neanderthals didn't.\n\n50:25.160 --> 50:29.000\n Nowadays, there's evidence of interbreeding,\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:30.400\n quite extensive interbreeding\n\n50:30.400 --> 50:33.120\n between sapiens and Neanderthals,\n\n50:33.120 --> 50:35.160\n as well as with some other groups.\n\n50:35.160 --> 50:37.280\n And sometimes people say, well, you know,\n\n50:37.280 --> 50:38.560\n so they loved each other.\n\n50:38.560 --> 50:40.440\n They made love, not war.\n\n50:40.440 --> 50:42.760\n I think they made love and war.\n\n50:42.760 --> 50:46.520\n And it wouldn't necessarily mean too loving.\n\n50:46.520 --> 50:49.280\n I mean, if you just follow through\n\n50:49.280 --> 50:51.720\n from typical ethnographies nowadays\n\n50:51.720 --> 50:55.440\n of when dominant groups meet subordinate groups,\n\n50:55.440 --> 50:56.880\n they didn't know each other,\n\n50:56.880 --> 51:00.520\n then you can imagine that Neanderthal females\n\n51:00.520 --> 51:02.400\n would essentially be captured\n\n51:02.400 --> 51:05.360\n and taken into sapiens groups.\n\n51:07.080 --> 51:12.080\n Maybe you can comment on this cautiously and eloquently.\n\n51:13.840 --> 51:18.200\n What's the role of sexual violence in human evolution?\n\n51:18.200 --> 51:21.480\n Because you mentioned taking Neanderthal females.\n\n51:21.480 --> 51:23.920\n You've also mentioned that some of these rules\n\n51:23.920 --> 51:28.760\n are defined by the male side of the society.\n\n51:28.760 --> 51:31.600\n What's the role of sexual violence in this story?\n\n51:33.080 --> 51:34.080\n I think you've got to distinguish\n\n51:34.080 --> 51:35.840\n between groups and within groups.\n\n51:37.600 --> 51:42.600\n And I think the world has been slowly waking up\n\n51:43.200 --> 51:46.000\n over the last several decades\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:51.000\n to the fact that sexual violence is routine in war.\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:56.000\n And that to me says that it's just another example\n\n51:58.680 --> 52:03.680\n of power corrupts because when frustrated,\n\n52:04.800 --> 52:09.800\n scared, elated soldiers come upon females\n\n52:11.400 --> 52:16.400\n in a group that has been essential dehumanization of,\n\n52:16.400 --> 52:20.520\n then they get carried away by opportunity.\n\n52:21.680 --> 52:25.080\n It is not always possible to argue\n\n52:25.080 --> 52:28.480\n that this is adaptive nowadays\n\n52:28.480 --> 52:31.120\n because you get lots and lots of stories\n\n52:31.120 --> 52:36.120\n of women being abused to the point of being killed.\n\n52:38.640 --> 52:41.200\n She'll be gang raped and then killed.\n\n52:41.200 --> 52:46.120\n There's lots of terrible cases of that reported\n\n52:46.120 --> 52:47.680\n from all sorts of different wars.\n\n52:49.560 --> 52:54.560\n But you can see that that could build on a pattern\n\n52:54.840 --> 52:57.360\n that would have been adaptive\n\n52:57.360 --> 53:01.520\n if happening under so much less extreme circumstances.\n\n53:02.880 --> 53:05.160\n The war is very extreme nowadays\n\n53:05.160 --> 53:07.440\n in the sense that you get battles\n\n53:07.440 --> 53:11.240\n in which people are sent by a military hierarchy\n\n53:11.240 --> 53:14.120\n into a war situation in which they do not feel\n\n53:14.120 --> 53:16.440\n what hunters and gatherers would typically have felt,\n\n53:16.440 --> 53:18.600\n which would have been that if we attack,\n\n53:18.600 --> 53:21.920\n we have an excellent chance of getting away with it.\n\n53:21.920 --> 53:25.840\n Nowadays, you're sent in across the Somme or whatever it is\n\n53:25.840 --> 53:28.640\n and there's a very high chance you will be killed.\n\n53:28.640 --> 53:30.280\n And that's totally unnatural\n\n53:30.280 --> 53:33.040\n and a novel evolutionary experience, I think.\n\n53:34.760 --> 53:37.480\n Then there's sexual coercion within groups.\n\n53:37.480 --> 53:42.120\n And so that takes various kinds of forms.\n\n53:42.120 --> 53:44.720\n But nowadays, of course,\n\n53:44.720 --> 53:46.960\n I think people recognize increasingly\n\n53:46.960 --> 53:51.960\n that the principle form of sexual intimidation\n\n53:53.440 --> 53:57.080\n and rape occurs within relationships.\n\n53:58.400 --> 53:59.840\n It's not stranger rape\n\n53:59.840 --> 54:03.400\n that is really statistically important.\n\n54:03.400 --> 54:08.400\n There's much more what happens behind the walls\n\n54:08.400 --> 54:13.400\n of a bedroom where people have been living for some time.\n\n54:14.400 --> 54:19.400\n And just two sort of thoughts and observations about this.\n\n54:20.400 --> 54:25.320\n One is that it may seem odd\n\n54:25.320 --> 54:30.320\n that males should think it a good idea, as it were,\n\n54:34.360 --> 54:37.800\n to impose themselves sexually on someone\n\n54:37.800 --> 54:39.640\n with whom they have a relationship.\n\n54:40.960 --> 54:45.480\n But what they're doing is intimidating someone\n\n54:45.480 --> 54:48.840\n in a relationship in which the relative power\n\n54:48.840 --> 54:52.280\n in the relationship has continuing significance\n\n54:52.280 --> 54:53.800\n for a long time.\n\n54:53.800 --> 54:58.320\n And that power probably goes well beyond just the sexual.\n\n54:58.320 --> 55:01.360\n It's to do with domestic relationships,\n\n55:01.360 --> 55:05.680\n it's to do with the man getting his own way all the way.\n\n55:05.680 --> 55:09.800\n It's power dynamics and the sexual aggression\n\n55:09.800 --> 55:12.480\n is one of the tools to regain power,\n\n55:12.480 --> 55:14.880\n gain power, gain more power and that kind of thing.\n\n55:14.880 --> 55:16.680\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n55:16.680 --> 55:21.320\n And in that respect, it's worth noting\n\n55:21.320 --> 55:25.680\n that although this wasn't appreciated for some time,\n\n55:25.680 --> 55:28.320\n it's emerging that in a bunch of primates\n\n55:28.320 --> 55:32.160\n you have somewhat similar, somewhat parallel\n\n55:32.160 --> 55:35.000\n kinds of sexual intimidation\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:37.800\n where males will target particular females,\n\n55:37.800 --> 55:41.280\n even in a group in which the norm is for females\n\n55:41.280 --> 55:43.480\n to mate with multiple males.\n\n55:43.480 --> 55:45.920\n But each male will target a particular female\n\n55:45.920 --> 55:49.560\n and the more he is aggressive towards her,\n\n55:49.560 --> 55:53.160\n then the more she conforms to his wishes\n\n55:53.160 --> 55:55.240\n when he wants to mate.\n\n55:55.240 --> 55:57.920\n So a long term pattern of sexual intimidation.\n\n55:58.840 --> 56:00.320\n So there's that aspect.\n\n56:00.320 --> 56:02.680\n The other aspect I would just note is that\n\n56:02.680 --> 56:07.680\n males get away with a lot compared to females\n\n56:10.240 --> 56:13.680\n in any kind of intersexual conflict.\n\n56:16.160 --> 56:19.960\n So the punishment, here's one example of this,\n\n56:19.960 --> 56:23.520\n the punishment for a husband killing a wife\n\n56:23.520 --> 56:25.640\n has always been much less than the punishment\n\n56:25.640 --> 56:27.120\n for a wife killing a husband.\n\n56:29.960 --> 56:32.200\n And you see similar sorts of things\n\n56:32.200 --> 56:37.200\n in terms of the punishments for adultery and so on.\n\n56:38.680 --> 56:42.960\n I bring this up in the context of males\n\n56:42.960 --> 56:47.200\n sexually intimidating their partners,\n\n56:47.200 --> 56:49.160\n be it wives or whoever,\n\n56:50.680 --> 56:52.520\n because it's a reminder that\n\n56:53.560 --> 56:57.800\n it's basically a patriarchal world that we have come from.\n\n56:57.800 --> 57:02.080\n A patriarchal world in which male alliances\n\n57:02.080 --> 57:06.280\n tend to support males and take advantage of the fact\n\n57:06.280 --> 57:09.760\n that they have political power at the expense of females.\n\n57:09.760 --> 57:12.000\n And I would say that that all goes back\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:14.800\n to what happened three to 400,000 years ago\n\n57:14.800 --> 57:16.680\n when the beta males took charge\n\n57:16.680 --> 57:19.160\n and they started imposing their own norms\n\n57:19.160 --> 57:22.520\n on society as a whole and they've continued to do so.\n\n57:22.520 --> 57:26.200\n And we now look at ourselves and Jordan Peterson says,\n\n57:26.200 --> 57:28.800\n we are not a patriarchal society.\n\n57:28.800 --> 57:33.000\n Well, it's true that the laws try and make it even handed\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:35.440\n nowadays between males and females,\n\n57:35.440 --> 57:38.840\n but obviously we are patriarchal de facto\n\n57:38.840 --> 57:43.840\n because society still in many ways supports men\n\n57:45.360 --> 57:48.040\n better than it supports women in these sorts of conflicts.\n\n57:48.040 --> 57:50.560\n So beta male patriarchal.\n\n57:51.880 --> 57:55.320\n If we're looking at the evolutionary history.\n\n57:55.320 --> 57:58.880\n Okay, is there, maybe sticking on Jordan for a second,\n\n57:58.880 --> 58:03.880\n is there, so he's a psychologist, right?\n\n58:04.440 --> 58:09.440\n And what part of the picture do you think he's missing\n\n58:09.960 --> 58:14.800\n in analyzing the human relations?\n\n58:16.120 --> 58:20.120\n Like what does he need to understand\n\n58:20.120 --> 58:22.400\n about our origins in violence\n\n58:22.400 --> 58:24.960\n and the way that society has been constructed?\n\n58:24.960 --> 58:29.960\n Or I don't want to go deep into his missing perspectives,\n\n58:30.320 --> 58:34.520\n but I just think that what he's doing\n\n58:34.520 --> 58:37.800\n in that particular example is focusing\n\n58:37.800 --> 58:40.160\n on the legalistic position.\n\n58:41.080 --> 58:46.080\n And that's great that you do not find formal patriarchy\n\n58:47.480 --> 58:49.720\n in the law, anything like to the extent\n\n58:49.720 --> 58:53.800\n that you could find it 100 years ago and so on.\n\n58:53.800 --> 58:56.080\n Women have got the vote now, hooray.\n\n58:56.080 --> 58:58.640\n But it took a long time for women to get the vote.\n\n58:58.640 --> 59:03.640\n And it remains the case that women suffer\n\n59:06.320 --> 59:08.560\n in various kinds of ways.\n\n59:08.560 --> 59:13.560\n I mean, a woman who has lots of sexual partners\n\n59:15.480 --> 59:18.560\n is treated much more rudely than a male\n\n59:18.560 --> 59:21.240\n who has lots of sexual partners.\n\n59:21.240 --> 59:23.120\n There are all sorts of informal ways\n\n59:23.120 --> 59:27.200\n in which it's rougher being a woman than it is a man.\n\n59:27.200 --> 59:32.200\n And if we look at the surface layer of the law,\n\n59:32.560 --> 59:36.320\n we may miss the deeper human nature,\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:41.200\n like the origins of our human nature that still operates\n\n59:41.200 --> 59:42.600\n no matter what the law says.\n\n59:42.600 --> 59:47.120\n Yeah, which is, you know, human nature is awkward\n\n59:47.120 --> 59:50.960\n because it includes some unpleasant features\n\n59:50.960 --> 59:54.200\n that when we sit back and reflect about them,\n\n59:54.200 --> 59:57.920\n we would like them to go away.\n\n59:57.920 --> 1:00:02.920\n But it remains the fact that men are hugely concerned\n\n1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:10.000\n to try and have sex with at least one woman,\n\n1:00:11.840 --> 1:00:14.040\n and you know, often lots of women.\n\n1:00:14.040 --> 1:00:17.280\n And so men are constantly putting pressure on women\n\n1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:19.880\n in ways that women find unpleasant.\n\n1:00:19.880 --> 1:00:21.680\n And if men sit back and reflect about it,\n\n1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:22.880\n they think, yeah, we shouldn't do this.\n\n1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:26.280\n But actually, it just goes on because of human nature.\n\n1:00:26.280 --> 1:00:30.920\n So maybe looking at particular humans in history,\n\n1:00:30.920 --> 1:00:32.840\n let's talk about Genghis Khan.\n\n1:00:32.840 --> 1:00:37.200\n So is this particular human who was one\n\n1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:42.200\n of the most famous examples of large scale violence,\n\n1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:45.760\n is he a deep representative of human nature\n\n1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:47.920\n or is he a rare exception?\n\n1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:52.920\n Well, I think that it's easy to imagine\n\n1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:57.440\n that most men could have become Genghis Khan.\n\n1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:02.240\n It's possible that he had a particular streak\n\n1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:03.280\n of psychopathy.\n\n1:01:06.400 --> 1:01:11.400\n You know, it's striking that by the time you become\n\n1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:16.400\n immensely powerful, then your willingness\n\n1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:23.120\n to do terrible things for the interest of yourself\n\n1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:28.120\n and your group becomes very high.\n\n1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:36.360\n Stalin, Mao Zedong, these sorts of people have histories\n\n1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:39.360\n in which they do not show obvious psychopathy.\n\n1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:41.240\n But by the time they are big leaders,\n\n1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:43.160\n they are really psychopathic in the sense\n\n1:01:43.160 --> 1:01:47.680\n that they do not follow the ordinary morality\n\n1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:52.680\n of considering the harm that they are doing\n\n1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:53.680\n to their victims.\n\n1:01:58.040 --> 1:02:00.400\n What kind of experiment would we need to discover\n\n1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:04.120\n whether or not anybody could fall into this position?\n\n1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:09.120\n I don't know, but Lord Acton's famous dictum\n\n1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:14.120\n was power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\n\n1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:16.360\n And then the point that people often forget\n\n1:02:16.360 --> 1:02:17.880\n is the next sentence that he said,\n\n1:02:17.880 --> 1:02:22.120\n which is, great men are almost always bad men.\n\n1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:23.680\n And that is right.\n\n1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:27.160\n It is very difficult to find a great man in history\n\n1:02:27.160 --> 1:02:30.440\n who was not responsible for terrible things.\n\n1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:35.440\n I think there's some aspect of it that it's not just power.\n\n1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:40.440\n I think men who have been the most destructive\n\n1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:45.440\n in human history are not psychopathic completely.\n\n1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.840\n They have convinced themselves of an idea.\n\n1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:52.320\n It's like the idea is psychopathic.\n\n1:02:52.320 --> 1:02:55.080\n Stalin, for example, Hitler's a complicated one.\n\n1:02:55.080 --> 1:02:57.240\n I think he was legitimately insane.\n\n1:02:57.240 --> 1:03:02.240\n But I think Stalin has convinced himself that he's doing good.\n\n1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:06.240\n So the idea of communism is the thing that's psychopathic\n\n1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:09.880\n in his mind, like it bred, you construct the worldview\n\n1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:14.360\n in which the violence is justified, the cruelty is justified.\n\n1:03:14.360 --> 1:03:18.320\n So there, in that sense, first of all,\n\n1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:21.320\n you can construct experiments, unethical experiments\n\n1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:25.280\n that could test this, but in that sense,\n\n1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:30.280\n anybody else could have been in Stalin's position.\n\n1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:34.080\n It's the idea that could overtake the mind\n\n1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:38.320\n of a human being and in so doing justify cruel acts.\n\n1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:42.080\n And that seems to be, at least in part, unique to humans,\n\n1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:45.520\n is the ability to hold ideas in our minds\n\n1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:49.360\n and share those ideas and use those ideas\n\n1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:53.720\n to convince ourselves that proactive violence\n\n1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:56.120\n on a large scale is a good idea.\n\n1:03:57.440 --> 1:03:58.920\n So that, I don't know if you have a comment.\n\n1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:01.960\n I suppose so, I mean, but it seems to me\n\n1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:06.960\n what really motivated Stalin was not so much communism\n\n1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:11.200\n as the retention of power.\n\n1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:17.400\n So once he became leader and in the process\n\n1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:20.920\n of becoming leader, he was absolutely desperate\n\n1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:24.160\n to get rid of anybody who was a challenger.\n\n1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:28.480\n He was deeply suspicious, suspicious of anybody,\n\n1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:32.560\n even on his side, who might possibly be showing\n\n1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:36.040\n a glimmerings of willingness to challenge him.\n\n1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:41.040\n So when he apparently had Kirov murdered,\n\n1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:46.920\n Kirov was a great communist, Trotsky was a great communist,\n\n1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:51.920\n all his rivals, and I mean, when he went into the towns\n\n1:04:52.360 --> 1:04:55.240\n and murdered people by the tenths of thousands.\n\n1:04:55.240 --> 1:04:56.200\n They were all communists.\n\n1:04:56.200 --> 1:05:00.120\n A lot of them were explicit communists, that's right.\n\n1:05:00.120 --> 1:05:02.560\n But what he was worried about was that they were rivals\n\n1:05:02.560 --> 1:05:03.400\n to him.\n\n1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:08.880\n I suppose the thought is I am the best person\n\n1:05:08.880 --> 1:05:13.880\n to bring about a global sort of embrace of communism\n\n1:05:13.880 --> 1:05:17.640\n and others are not, and so we have to get rid\n\n1:05:17.640 --> 1:05:18.480\n of those others.\n\n1:05:18.480 --> 1:05:20.480\n Well, I suspect you're being very charitable here,\n\n1:05:20.480 --> 1:05:25.480\n but I mean, maybe you know enough about Stalin to really.\n\n1:05:25.480 --> 1:05:29.760\n Yes, well, so the point I'm making, I do quite a bit,\n\n1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:33.520\n is from my understanding and sense, of course,\n\n1:05:33.520 --> 1:05:37.520\n we can't know for sure, is he believed in communism.\n\n1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:41.600\n This wasn't purely a game of power.\n\n1:05:41.600 --> 1:05:45.280\n Now, he got drunk with power pretty quickly,\n\n1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:49.800\n but he really believed for, I believe his whole life,\n\n1:05:49.800 --> 1:05:53.120\n that communism is good for the world.\n\n1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:58.120\n And that, I don't know what role that belief plays\n\n1:05:58.360 --> 1:06:02.880\n with the more natural human desire for power.\n\n1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:05.000\n I don't know, but it just seems like.\n\n1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.320\n As we agreed, he's killing a lot of communists\n\n1:06:07.320 --> 1:06:09.520\n on his journey.\n\n1:06:09.520 --> 1:06:11.440\n On his journey.\n\n1:06:11.440 --> 1:06:15.520\n Hmm, but it's not, that calculus doesn't work that way.\n\n1:06:15.520 --> 1:06:18.400\n There's humans who are communists\n\n1:06:18.400 --> 1:06:20.880\n and then there's the idea of communism.\n\n1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:25.720\n So for him, in his delusional world view,\n\n1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:30.280\n killing a few people is worth the final result\n\n1:06:30.280 --> 1:06:32.720\n of bringing communism to the whole world.\n\n1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:34.320\n But it was more than that, again, because I mean,\n\n1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:37.600\n he really wanted power for the Soviet Union\n\n1:06:37.600 --> 1:06:42.600\n and so surely the reason that he orchestrated\n\n1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:48.920\n the export of wheat from Ukraine\n\n1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:53.920\n and in so doing was willing to lead to mass starvation\n\n1:06:53.920 --> 1:06:56.040\n was because he wanted to sell it on the market\n\n1:06:56.040 --> 1:06:57.560\n in order to be able to build up\n\n1:06:57.560 --> 1:07:01.120\n the power of the Soviet Union.\n\n1:07:01.120 --> 1:07:03.600\n Alternative view of communism might have been,\n\n1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:07.160\n well, let's just make sure everybody survives\n\n1:07:07.160 --> 1:07:09.560\n and make sure everybody has enough to eat\n\n1:07:09.560 --> 1:07:13.640\n and we'll all be mutually supportive in a communal network.\n\n1:07:13.640 --> 1:07:16.160\n But no, but he wanted the power for the country.\n\n1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:19.320\n Well, I guess exactly, so that it's not even communism,\n\n1:07:19.320 --> 1:07:21.800\n the set of ideas are like Marxism or something like that,\n\n1:07:21.800 --> 1:07:23.080\n it's the country.\n\n1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:27.480\n I guess what I'm saying is it's not purely power\n\n1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:31.280\n for the individual, it's power for a vision\n\n1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:34.840\n for this great nation, the Soviet Union.\n\n1:07:34.840 --> 1:07:39.320\n And it's similar with Hitler, the guy believed\n\n1:07:39.320 --> 1:07:42.320\n that this is a great nation, Germany,\n\n1:07:42.320 --> 1:07:47.320\n and it's a nation that's been wronged throughout history\n\n1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:49.960\n and needs to be righted.\n\n1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:54.440\n And there's some dance between the individual human\n\n1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:55.560\n and the tribe.\n\n1:07:55.560 --> 1:08:00.040\n Yes, absolutely, yes, and so just like chimpanzees,\n\n1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:04.080\n we are fiercely tribal and the tribalism resides\n\n1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:09.080\n particularly in male psychology and it's very scary\n\n1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:14.200\n because once you assemble a set of males\n\n1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:18.880\n who share a tribal identity, then they have power\n\n1:08:18.880 --> 1:08:23.880\n that they can exert with very little concern\n\n1:08:25.760 --> 1:08:28.160\n about what they're doing to damage other people.\n\n1:08:29.120 --> 1:08:33.920\n Do you think this, so Nietzschean will to power,\n\n1:08:33.920 --> 1:08:36.120\n we talked about the corrupting nature of power,\n\n1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:38.680\n do you think that's a manifestation\n\n1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:42.840\n of those early origins of violence?\n\n1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:46.040\n What's the connection of this desire for power\n\n1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:49.000\n and our proclivity for violence?\n\n1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:54.480\n You know, what we're talking about is tribal power, right?\n\n1:08:54.480 --> 1:08:56.920\n Power on behalf of a group.\n\n1:08:56.920 --> 1:08:57.760\n Yes.\n\n1:08:57.760 --> 1:09:00.040\n And yeah, that seems to me to go right back\n\n1:09:00.040 --> 1:09:04.520\n to a deep evolutionary origin\n\n1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:07.200\n because you see essentially the same thing\n\n1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:10.520\n in a whole bunch of animals.\n\n1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:15.520\n That most of the sort of cognitively complex animals\n\n1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:20.240\n live in social groups in which they have tribal boundaries.\n\n1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:26.280\n And so what you see in chimpanzees is echoed\n\n1:09:26.280 --> 1:09:28.800\n in almost all of the primates.\n\n1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:32.720\n The difference between us and, you know,\n\n1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:34.520\n chimpanzees and humans on the one hand\n\n1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:36.520\n and other primates on the other\n\n1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:39.280\n is that we kill and they don't.\n\n1:09:39.280 --> 1:09:42.880\n And the reason they don't is because they never meet\n\n1:09:42.880 --> 1:09:46.000\n in the context where there are massive imbalances of power.\n\n1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:49.160\n So two groups of baboons, you know,\n\n1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:52.560\n there's 30 on this side and 50 on this side, fine.\n\n1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:54.640\n Nobody's gonna try and kill anybody else\n\n1:09:54.640 --> 1:09:59.560\n because the serious risks involved.\n\n1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:02.160\n But nevertheless, they are tribal.\n\n1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:06.120\n So, you know, they will have fairly intense\n\n1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:09.600\n intergroup interactions in which everybody knows\n\n1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:12.560\n who is on whose side.\n\n1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:17.560\n And the longterm consequences of winning those battles,\n\n1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:23.760\n nonlethal battles, is that the dominance get access\n\n1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:28.680\n to larger areas of land, more safety and so on,\n\n1:10:28.680 --> 1:10:33.680\n with chances are better record\n\n1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:38.360\n of reproductive success subsequently.\n\n1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.520\n Do you think this, from an evolutionary perspective,\n\n1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:44.040\n is a feature or a bug?\n\n1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:49.040\n Our natural sort of tendency to form tribes?\n\n1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:51.800\n So what's a bug?\n\n1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:56.600\n Oh, sorry, this is a computer programming analogy,\n\n1:10:57.680 --> 1:11:02.680\n meaning like it would be more beneficial.\n\n1:11:03.240 --> 1:11:07.760\n Is it beneficial or detrimental to form tribes\n\n1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:09.200\n from an evolutionary perspective?\n\n1:11:09.200 --> 1:11:11.000\n Yeah, yeah, but, but, but.\n\n1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:12.080\n What does it mean?\n\n1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:13.200\n What does a bug mean?\n\n1:11:13.200 --> 1:11:14.400\n Yes, right.\n\n1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:15.240\n I mean.\n\n1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:17.520\n Well, yeah, like where's evolution going anyway?\n\n1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:19.120\n It's beneficial from, you know,\n\n1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:20.880\n it's beneficial in the sense that it evolved\n\n1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:25.440\n by natural selection to benefit the individuals who did it.\n\n1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:28.800\n But if by bug you mean something that,\n\n1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:30.240\n from the point of view of the species,\n\n1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:32.560\n it would be great if you could just wipe this out\n\n1:11:32.560 --> 1:11:36.040\n because the species would somehow do better as a result.\n\n1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:38.400\n Then yes, but then, you know, males are a bug.\n\n1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:46.160\n Come on now, there's some nice things to males,\n\n1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:48.120\n speaking as a male.\n\n1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:50.160\n The fact that there are some nice things to males\n\n1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:51.960\n doesn't mean that they're not bugs.\n\n1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:53.880\n You know, maybe they're quite nice bugs,\n\n1:11:53.880 --> 1:11:56.400\n but it would be much better for the species as a whole\n\n1:11:56.400 --> 1:12:00.400\n not to have to have males who impose this violence\n\n1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:01.840\n on the species as a whole.\n\n1:12:01.840 --> 1:12:03.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:03.080 --> 1:12:05.160\n As somebody who practiced controlled violence\n\n1:12:05.160 --> 1:12:10.000\n and doing a lot of martial arts, yeah, I'm not sure.\n\n1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.720\n It does seem kind of fun to have this kind\n\n1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:15.280\n of controlled violence, also sports.\n\n1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:18.440\n Also, I mean, the question of conflict in general,\n\n1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:20.560\n I guess that's the deeper question.\n\n1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:24.200\n Don't you think there's some value to conflict\n\n1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:27.720\n for the improvement of society, for progress?\n\n1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:31.080\n That this tension between tribes,\n\n1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:35.240\n isn't this like a experiment,\n\n1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:37.680\n a continued experiment we conduct with each other\n\n1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:40.200\n to figure out what is a better world to build?\n\n1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:44.960\n Like you need that conflict of good ideas and bad ideas\n\n1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:47.480\n to go to war with each other.\n\n1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:50.600\n It's like the United States with the 50 states\n\n1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:53.620\n and it's the laboratory of ideas.\n\n1:12:53.620 --> 1:12:57.180\n Don't you think that is, again, feature versus bug?\n\n1:12:59.420 --> 1:13:02.960\n This kind of conflict, when it doesn't get out of hand,\n\n1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:05.000\n is actually ultimately progressive,\n\n1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:06.720\n productive for a better world.\n\n1:13:08.100 --> 1:13:10.080\n Well, what do you mean by conflict?\n\n1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:12.880\n I mean, you can have conflict in the sense of\n\n1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:16.520\n people have different ideas about the solution to a problem.\n\n1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:18.920\n And so their ideas are in conflict.\n\n1:13:18.920 --> 1:13:23.480\n They can sit down on a log and chat about it\n\n1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:25.640\n and then decide, okay, you're right,\n\n1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:27.100\n or I'm wrong or whatever.\n\n1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:33.080\n But if by conflict, you mean a great idea\n\n1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:35.520\n to build a nuclear bomb and set that off,\n\n1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:39.600\n then no, I don't see why it's a good idea\n\n1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:40.960\n to have all this violence.\n\n1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:45.960\n Yeah, there's, I wonder, I mean, it's not a good idea,\n\n1:13:49.900 --> 1:13:52.260\n but I wonder if human history would evolve\n\n1:13:52.260 --> 1:13:54.240\n the way it did without the violence.\n\n1:13:55.100 --> 1:13:56.740\n Oh, I'm sure you're right.\n\n1:13:56.740 --> 1:13:58.620\n Probably humans would not have evolved\n\n1:13:58.620 --> 1:14:00.700\n in the sense that we have.\n\n1:14:00.700 --> 1:14:05.700\n But I would hope that the course of violence in evolution\n\n1:14:05.700 --> 1:14:08.440\n will continue in the way it has.\n\n1:14:08.440 --> 1:14:11.760\n So, there's all sorts of indications\n\n1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:16.760\n that the importance of violence has been reduced over time.\n\n1:14:18.960 --> 1:14:22.960\n And this is made famous in Steven Pinker's book,\n\n1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:24.760\n but others have written about it too,\n\n1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:30.520\n that the frequency of death from violence\n\n1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:32.840\n in every country you look at,\n\n1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:36.160\n has been declining, that's just great.\n\n1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:38.040\n And so, you know, the amazing thing about this\n\n1:14:38.040 --> 1:14:40.280\n is that even when you take the deaths\n\n1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:42.960\n due to the First World War and the Second World War,\n\n1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:47.200\n the 20th century appears to have been statistically,\n\n1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:49.960\n meaning rates of death per individual,\n\n1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:54.160\n the least violent in history.\n\n1:14:56.560 --> 1:14:59.440\n So, we haven't got very far down the course\n\n1:14:59.440 --> 1:15:02.680\n to nonviolence, but we've got a long way to go.\n\n1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:05.720\n But I don't see why we shouldn't just carry on doing it.\n\n1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:10.640\n I think it's ridiculous, frankly, excuse my frankness,\n\n1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:13.120\n to say that violence is a good thing.\n\n1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:16.820\n I think that it would be a wonderful concept\n\n1:15:16.820 --> 1:15:19.720\n if we could evolve somehow to a world\n\n1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:22.040\n 3,000 years from now,\n\n1:15:22.040 --> 1:15:26.780\n where violence is really regarded as simply appalling,\n\n1:15:26.780 --> 1:15:29.920\n and that they look back on our time\n\n1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:32.520\n and can't believe what we were doing.\n\n1:15:32.520 --> 1:15:33.960\n Yeah, but of course,\n\n1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:35.760\n violence takes a lot of different shapes.\n\n1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:37.320\n As we start to think deeper and deeper\n\n1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:40.280\n about living beings on Earth,\n\n1:15:40.280 --> 1:15:41.920\n for example, the violence we commit\n\n1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:43.960\n and the torture we commit to animals,\n\n1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:45.240\n and then perhaps down the line,\n\n1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:48.480\n as we talked offline about with robots,\n\n1:15:48.480 --> 1:15:49.360\n and that kind of thing.\n\n1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:52.640\n So there's just so many ways to commit violence to others.\n\n1:15:52.640 --> 1:15:54.480\n And some people now talk about violence\n\n1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:58.000\n in the space of ideas, which of course, to me at least,\n\n1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:00.280\n is a bit of a silly notion relative\n\n1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:04.020\n to use that same V word for the space of ideas\n\n1:16:04.020 --> 1:16:06.420\n versus actual physical violence.\n\n1:16:06.420 --> 1:16:08.920\n But it may be that a long time from now,\n\n1:16:08.920 --> 1:16:12.600\n we see that even violence in the space of ideas\n\n1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:16.680\n is quite a manifestation of that same kind of violence.\n\n1:16:16.680 --> 1:16:19.480\n And so it is interesting where this is headed.\n\n1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:23.000\n And I think you're absolutely right.\n\n1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:27.580\n A world, a nonviolent world, does seem like a better world.\n\n1:16:27.580 --> 1:16:30.640\n I wonder if the constraints on resources\n\n1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:34.360\n somehow make that world more and more difficult,\n\n1:16:34.360 --> 1:16:36.120\n especially as we run out of resources.\n\n1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:37.460\n Well, it's got to be very, very different\n\n1:16:37.460 --> 1:16:38.920\n from what we're doing nowadays.\n\n1:16:38.920 --> 1:16:40.880\n And it's unimaginably different.\n\n1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:41.800\n If we could imagine it,\n\n1:16:41.800 --> 1:16:43.200\n then maybe we could work towards it.\n\n1:16:43.200 --> 1:16:45.480\n At the moment, nobody knows how to work towards it.\n\n1:16:45.480 --> 1:16:46.960\n Well, that's kind of the stories of humans\n\n1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:48.640\n is we don't really know the future.\n\n1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:53.200\n We're trying to ad hoc kind of develop it as we go\n\n1:16:53.200 --> 1:16:55.440\n and sometimes get into trouble.\n\n1:16:55.440 --> 1:16:57.040\n That's the violence.\n\n1:16:57.040 --> 1:16:59.800\n But George Orwell's vision in 1984\n\n1:16:59.800 --> 1:17:04.760\n was of two or three world powers each so powerful\n\n1:17:04.760 --> 1:17:09.940\n that nobody could destroy the other.\n\n1:17:11.800 --> 1:17:16.080\n But the notion of an evolutionarily stable relationship\n\n1:17:16.080 --> 1:17:20.160\n among heavily armed world powers\n\n1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:27.320\n just does not seem as though it's reasonable at all.\n\n1:17:27.320 --> 1:17:36.160\n That is to say, we've now got 170 or 190 nations in the world\n\n1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:39.440\n dominated by a few big ones,\n\n1:17:39.440 --> 1:17:42.160\n all with arms pointing at each other.\n\n1:17:42.160 --> 1:17:45.280\n And the notion that we could just carry on\n\n1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:49.200\n having peace talks and making sure that these arms\n\n1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:54.080\n don't get involved in some kind of massive conflagration\n\n1:17:54.080 --> 1:17:56.960\n seems incredibly optimistic.\n\n1:17:56.960 --> 1:18:01.880\n Some kind of major change has to happen whereby,\n\n1:18:01.880 --> 1:18:04.080\n and some people would like to see all the weapons go.\n\n1:18:04.080 --> 1:18:05.080\n That'd be great.\n\n1:18:05.080 --> 1:18:07.840\n I'm a member of that sort of group\n\n1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:10.600\n that tries to see that happen.\n\n1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:13.080\n It's going to be very difficult to see it happen.\n\n1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:16.040\n Another kind of concept is the nations themselves\n\n1:18:16.040 --> 1:18:21.840\n will dissolve and will become one government.\n\n1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:23.680\n That itself is a terrifying vision\n\n1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:28.000\n because the capacity for abuse by a single world power\n\n1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:30.760\n would be so problematic.\n\n1:18:30.760 --> 1:18:32.440\n And in addition, how do you get there\n\n1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:35.240\n without a war in the first place?\n\n1:18:35.240 --> 1:18:40.040\n So at the moment, we have no reasonable kind of future\n\n1:18:40.040 --> 1:18:41.960\n in mind, but I'm sure it's there somewhere.\n\n1:18:41.960 --> 1:18:43.600\n It's just that we haven't yet to find it.\n\n1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:46.040\n And a lot of people like in the cryptocurrency space\n\n1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:49.640\n argue that you can create decentralized societies\n\n1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:52.280\n if you take away the power from states\n\n1:18:52.280 --> 1:18:54.080\n to define the monetary system.\n\n1:18:54.080 --> 1:18:58.680\n So they argue like if you make the monetary system\n\n1:18:58.680 --> 1:19:01.240\n such that it's disjoint from the control\n\n1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:03.960\n of any one individual, any one government,\n\n1:19:03.960 --> 1:19:05.720\n then that might be a way to form\n\n1:19:05.720 --> 1:19:08.000\n sort of ad hoc decentralized societies.\n\n1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:10.800\n They just pop up all over the place.\n\n1:19:10.800 --> 1:19:13.880\n That's a really interesting technological solution\n\n1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:17.960\n to how to remove the overreach of power from governments.\n\n1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:19.040\n Yes, right.\n\n1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:20.000\n Absolutely.\n\n1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:24.520\n And it may well be that the future will emerge\n\n1:19:24.520 --> 1:19:28.640\n out of some sort of quite surprising direction like that.\n\n1:19:28.640 --> 1:19:31.160\n Is it nevertheless surprising to you\n\n1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:34.240\n that we have not destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons?\n\n1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:36.480\n So the mutually assured destruction\n\n1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:38.440\n that we've had for many decades\n\n1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:40.760\n from somebody who studies violence,\n\n1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:43.240\n how does that make sense to you?\n\n1:19:43.240 --> 1:19:45.440\n Well, I mean, I'm surprised only in the sense\n\n1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:50.440\n that accidental, the fact that we have not had an accident\n\n1:19:51.040 --> 1:19:54.280\n yet has been quite remarkable.\n\n1:19:54.280 --> 1:19:56.040\n Yeah, because all the accounts are\n\n1:19:56.040 --> 1:19:59.280\n that we've come very close to having very serious accidents\n\n1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:03.120\n where people on either side have misread intentions\n\n1:20:03.120 --> 1:20:05.280\n or apparent launches and so on.\n\n1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:08.200\n So yes, I think it is remarkable.\n\n1:20:08.200 --> 1:20:13.200\n There is a nasty generalization that can be made\n\n1:20:14.080 --> 1:20:19.080\n that the longer that powerful states go without having wars\n\n1:20:20.640 --> 1:20:23.360\n than the worst the war is afterwards.\n\n1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:28.400\n And you can sort of see that that kind of makes sense\n\n1:20:28.400 --> 1:20:32.000\n because basically what's happening with these tribal groups\n\n1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:33.680\n that the nations are at the moment\n\n1:20:33.680 --> 1:20:38.120\n is that after a big war like the Second World War,\n\n1:20:38.120 --> 1:20:41.160\n they establish new kinds of dominance relationships.\n\n1:20:41.160 --> 1:20:45.000\n And then during the periods of peace,\n\n1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:50.000\n what happens is that the de facto dominance relationships\n\n1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:53.920\n change because some nations become poorer,\n\n1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:55.320\n some become richer,\n\n1:20:55.320 --> 1:20:57.840\n some become more militarily powerful and so on.\n\n1:20:57.840 --> 1:21:01.600\n Generally, economy and military goes hand in hand.\n\n1:21:01.600 --> 1:21:05.480\n So right now, China emerged from the war\n\n1:21:05.480 --> 1:21:09.520\n as a relatively low status state and is now high status.\n\n1:21:09.520 --> 1:21:11.600\n So if this were chimpanzees, what would happen\n\n1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:13.120\n is that you would predict a conflict\n\n1:21:13.120 --> 1:21:16.120\n because you need to have a readjustment\n\n1:21:16.120 --> 1:21:18.240\n of the formal dominance relationships\n\n1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:22.280\n to recognize the new in practice dominance relationships\n\n1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:24.760\n recognized by the economy and the military.\n\n1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:29.240\n So the longer that you have of a period of peace\n\n1:21:29.240 --> 1:21:32.360\n following a war, then the more these tensions\n\n1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:37.200\n of unresolved changed dominance relationships build up.\n\n1:21:37.200 --> 1:21:39.560\n And the longer they take to occur,\n\n1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:44.560\n then the more challenging are gonna be the conflicts.\n\n1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:47.440\n That's a terrifying view\n\n1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:50.520\n because we've been out of conflict for quite a bit.\n\n1:21:50.520 --> 1:21:52.720\n That's right. Maybe it's building up.\n\n1:21:52.720 --> 1:21:53.560\n So it's a scary view.\n\n1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:56.640\n But on the other hand, things have changed hugely\n\n1:21:56.640 --> 1:21:59.720\n with the advent of nuclear weapons\n\n1:21:59.720 --> 1:22:04.720\n because at least that conforms to this psychology\n\n1:22:05.040 --> 1:22:06.720\n that is very clear in other animals,\n\n1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:08.840\n which is you don't want to get into a fight\n\n1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:11.080\n if you are going to get hurt.\n\n1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:13.480\n So that's the whole principle of MAD,\n\n1:22:13.480 --> 1:22:15.680\n Mutual Assured Destruction.\n\n1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:18.640\n And it's doubtless been why powerful nations\n\n1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:23.640\n like America and Russia have not used their nuclear weapons\n\n1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:25.520\n since 1945.\n\n1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:30.520\n So if we can overcome the problem of accidental launches,\n\n1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:36.160\n then maybe the fact of MAD does fit into human psychology\n\n1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:40.200\n in a way that means that we really will resolve our tensions\n\n1:22:40.200 --> 1:22:41.440\n without using them.\n\n1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:46.440\n But we haven't yet really faced that challenge.\n\n1:22:46.440 --> 1:22:48.560\n I mean, the Soviet Union collapsed\n\n1:22:48.560 --> 1:22:50.960\n because of the poor economy,\n\n1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:55.960\n but with China desperate to take back Taiwan\n\n1:22:57.360 --> 1:23:02.360\n and America shifting its focus on the Pacific,\n\n1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:04.960\n the potential for something going wrong\n\n1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:06.200\n is clearly very high.\n\n1:23:07.080 --> 1:23:10.400\n So what's the hopeful case that you can make\n\n1:23:10.400 --> 1:23:14.840\n for a long term surviving and thriving human civilization\n\n1:23:14.840 --> 1:23:17.080\n given all the dangers that we face?\n\n1:23:17.080 --> 1:23:19.520\n Well, I can't really exactly make one.\n\n1:23:19.520 --> 1:23:20.840\n I would just say that,\n\n1:23:20.840 --> 1:23:24.840\n we're talking about the dangers,\n\n1:23:24.840 --> 1:23:27.040\n obviously the dangers are there.\n\n1:23:27.040 --> 1:23:29.560\n But what I would sort of think about\n\n1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:34.560\n is the notion that surprises come from all sorts\n\n1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:37.520\n of different directions.\n\n1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:42.280\n And I mean, you work in robotics\n\n1:23:42.280 --> 1:23:46.280\n and I can well imagine that you have a lot of experience\n\n1:23:46.280 --> 1:23:50.280\n and imagine that there will be advances in robotics\n\n1:23:50.280 --> 1:23:52.880\n that in some way I can't even conceive\n\n1:23:52.880 --> 1:23:57.880\n will somehow undermine the motivation for conflict.\n\n1:23:58.040 --> 1:24:01.720\n Something about by the time chips have been planted\n\n1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:05.560\n in human brains and we're all instantly sharing information\n\n1:24:05.560 --> 1:24:08.400\n in a way that we never did before,\n\n1:24:08.400 --> 1:24:12.040\n will this change the nature of human existence\n\n1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:15.120\n in such a way that these conflicts get resolved?\n\n1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:17.760\n So remove the conflicts, but keep some of the magic,\n\n1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:19.600\n the beauty of what it means to be human.\n\n1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:22.760\n So like still be able to enjoy life, the richness of life,\n\n1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:24.680\n the full complexity of life.\n\n1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:28.320\n Cause you can remove conflict by giving everybody a pill\n\n1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:30.440\n and then they go to sleep, right?\n\n1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:35.440\n You still want life to be amazing, exciting, interesting.\n\n1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:39.900\n And so that's where you have to find the balance.\n\n1:24:39.900 --> 1:24:42.960\n Well, it's, yes, I mean, it's all science fiction stuff.\n\n1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:47.740\n And so how it's gonna work out, totally unclear.\n\n1:24:51.040 --> 1:24:55.040\n I don't see any worry about the magic of life disappearing.\n\n1:24:55.040 --> 1:24:57.880\n I mean, first of all, you somehow get rid of males.\n\n1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:00.040\n I think you really need to get rid of males\n\n1:25:00.040 --> 1:25:05.040\n cause males are the source of a major problem,\n\n1:25:05.640 --> 1:25:10.640\n which is the lust for power and the resulting conflict.\n\n1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:14.360\n But you don't think the males are also source of beauty\n\n1:25:14.360 --> 1:25:15.200\n and creation?\n\n1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:18.120\n No, I mean, I don't have anything against males\n\n1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:20.400\n as individuals and that sort of thing.\n\n1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:22.820\n And males have clearly done a lot.\n\n1:25:22.820 --> 1:25:27.040\n I mean, they've been incredibly exploratory and creative\n\n1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:30.920\n and what they've done in art and music has been wonderful\n\n1:25:30.920 --> 1:25:32.120\n and that sort of thing.\n\n1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:33.020\n On the other hand,\n\n1:25:34.440 --> 1:25:36.160\n I'm not sure there's anything particularly special.\n\n1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:39.160\n And I think that probably females could do the same thing\n\n1:25:39.160 --> 1:25:40.920\n just as well when given the chance.\n\n1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:44.320\n Yes, including the dark stuff.\n\n1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:47.980\n I mean, a partial part of me is not understanding the,\n\n1:25:47.980 --> 1:25:52.620\n so there is evolutionary distinction between men and women,\n\n1:25:52.620 --> 1:25:55.720\n but I tend to believe both men and women,\n\n1:25:55.720 --> 1:25:58.640\n if you look out into the future, can be destructive,\n\n1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:02.000\n can be evil, can be greedy, can be corrupted by power.\n\n1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:03.640\n So if you move males from the picture,\n\n1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:07.160\n which are historically connected to this evolution\n\n1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:09.760\n that we've been talking about, that women are gonna fill\n\n1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:11.920\n that role quite nicely.\n\n1:26:11.920 --> 1:26:15.080\n And then it'll be just the same kind of process.\n\n1:26:15.080 --> 1:26:20.080\n Not the same, but it'll be new and interesting.\n\n1:26:21.080 --> 1:26:25.400\n There's a sense that the will to power, craving power,\n\n1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:28.200\n committing violence is somehow coupled\n\n1:26:28.200 --> 1:26:32.560\n with all of the things that are beautiful about life.\n\n1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:35.080\n That if you remove conflict completely,\n\n1:26:35.080 --> 1:26:37.720\n if you remove all of the evil in the world,\n\n1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:43.720\n it seems like you're going to,\n\n1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:47.540\n you're not going to have a stable place\n\n1:26:47.540 --> 1:26:49.440\n for the beauty, for the goodness.\n\n1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:54.440\n Like there's always has to be a dragon to fight for the way.\n\n1:26:54.940 --> 1:26:57.440\n If you look at human history, now you can say,\n\n1:26:57.440 --> 1:27:00.360\n the reason I'm nervous about a sort of utopia\n\n1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:03.620\n where everything is great is every time you look\n\n1:27:03.620 --> 1:27:06.720\n through human history when utopia has been chased,\n\n1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:09.840\n you run into a lot of trouble or again,\n\n1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:13.680\n sneaks into this evil, this craving for power.\n\n1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:16.640\n Now you could say that's a male problem,\n\n1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:18.920\n but I just think it's a human problem.\n\n1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:22.120\n And it's not even a human problem, it's a chimp problem too.\n\n1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:23.680\n It's life on earth problem,\n\n1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:25.560\n intelligent life on earth problem.\n\n1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:30.560\n So like it's better to not necessarily get rid\n\n1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:34.560\n of the sources of the darker sides of human nature,\n\n1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:38.080\n but more create mechanisms that the kindness,\n\n1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:41.760\n the goodness as the goodness paradox, your book,\n\n1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:46.760\n that that is incentivized and encouraged, empowered.\n\n1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:54.240\n Well, look, I don't think it would be utopia\n\n1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:56.440\n if you got rid of the males.\n\n1:27:56.440 --> 1:27:57.280\n Right.\n\n1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:00.520\n And certainly females are capable of conflict.\n\n1:28:01.600 --> 1:28:03.260\n I just think it's a gamble worth taking\n\n1:28:03.260 --> 1:28:04.880\n if you could actually do it.\n\n1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:07.120\n You can certainly find females in history\n\n1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:11.280\n who've done unpleasant things, but nevertheless,\n\n1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:13.480\n we have a very strong evolutionary theory\n\n1:28:13.480 --> 1:28:16.980\n which explains why males benefit more\n\n1:28:16.980 --> 1:28:21.540\n by having conflict and winning conflicts than females do.\n\n1:28:21.540 --> 1:28:26.540\n And so if we want to talk about reducing conflict,\n\n1:28:28.780 --> 1:28:31.920\n then it would reduce it to get rid of males.\n\n1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:34.100\n Now I understand this is a fantasy,\n\n1:28:34.100 --> 1:28:37.100\n and I think it's a fantasy that people would be able\n\n1:28:37.100 --> 1:28:40.540\n to talk about fairly soon because reproductive technology\n\n1:28:40.540 --> 1:28:44.300\n is getting to the point where it's quite likely\n\n1:28:44.300 --> 1:28:49.220\n that human females could breed without the use of males.\n\n1:28:49.220 --> 1:28:50.540\n Mm hmm.\n\n1:28:50.540 --> 1:28:55.540\n And so there would be a sort of a potential dynamic\n\n1:28:55.660 --> 1:29:00.660\n if everybody just agreed not to have any male babies.\n\n1:29:01.780 --> 1:29:03.740\n It's a really interesting thought experiment.\n\n1:29:03.740 --> 1:29:07.380\n I will agree with you that if given two buttons,\n\n1:29:07.380 --> 1:29:09.620\n one is get rid of all women,\n\n1:29:09.620 --> 1:29:11.780\n and the other button is get rid of all men,\n\n1:29:13.960 --> 1:29:18.960\n realizing that I have a stake in this choice,\n\n1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:20.800\n you're probably getting rid of all men\n\n1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:25.680\n if I wanted to preserve earth\n\n1:29:25.680 --> 1:29:28.460\n and the richness of life on earth,\n\n1:29:28.460 --> 1:29:30.300\n I would probably get rid of all men.\n\n1:29:30.300 --> 1:29:31.140\n I don't know.\n\n1:29:31.140 --> 1:29:32.360\n I don't think you have a stake in it.\n\n1:29:32.360 --> 1:29:35.320\n You know, I mean, you're saying that because you're a man.\n\n1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:36.160\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:39.560\n But I don't see why being a man should make you\n\n1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:42.640\n any more interested in having a male future for the world\n\n1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:43.640\n than a female future.\n\n1:29:43.640 --> 1:29:46.020\n You know, you've got just as many ancestors\n\n1:29:46.020 --> 1:29:48.400\n who were male as were female.\n\n1:29:48.400 --> 1:29:50.340\n Well, my problem is I'll have to die.\n\n1:29:51.440 --> 1:29:53.760\n Well, that's gonna happen anyway.\n\n1:29:53.760 --> 1:29:56.920\n I know, but like, I prefer to die tomorrow, not today.\n\n1:29:56.920 --> 1:30:00.520\n You know, I prefer to hit the snooze button\n\n1:30:00.520 --> 1:30:03.720\n on the whole mortality thing, but it's interesting.\n\n1:30:03.720 --> 1:30:05.560\n But this is not suggesting that males have to die\n\n1:30:05.560 --> 1:30:06.800\n in order to make room for females.\n\n1:30:06.800 --> 1:30:11.480\n It's just, you know, all you have to do is just say,\n\n1:30:11.480 --> 1:30:13.920\n don't let's have any more males born.\n\n1:30:13.920 --> 1:30:14.760\n Interesting.\n\n1:30:14.760 --> 1:30:16.600\n Of course, you know, the difficulty is that\n\n1:30:16.600 --> 1:30:19.840\n because we're tribal, you know, some country somewhere\n\n1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:21.360\n would say, well, we're not gonna do that.\n\n1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:22.180\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:22.180 --> 1:30:23.020\n And then guess what?\n\n1:30:23.020 --> 1:30:24.760\n They'd take over, you know, because they're male.\n\n1:30:24.760 --> 1:30:27.760\n So that's why it's impossible to imagine actually happening.\n\n1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:31.040\n You know what, I'm gonna take that\n\n1:30:31.040 --> 1:30:32.200\n and actually think about it.\n\n1:30:32.200 --> 1:30:34.900\n I don't know, I'm uncomfortable.\n\n1:30:34.900 --> 1:30:39.280\n There's a certain kind of woke culture\n\n1:30:39.280 --> 1:30:41.600\n that I've been kind of uncomfortable with\n\n1:30:41.600 --> 1:30:44.520\n because it's not women necessarily.\n\n1:30:44.520 --> 1:30:47.880\n It's more just, there's a lot of bullying I see.\n\n1:30:47.880 --> 1:30:50.880\n There's a lack of empathy and a lack of kindness\n\n1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:53.440\n towards others that's created by that culture.\n\n1:30:53.440 --> 1:30:55.200\n So, but you're speaking about something else.\n\n1:30:55.200 --> 1:31:00.200\n You're speaking about reducing conflict in this world\n\n1:31:00.240 --> 1:31:04.440\n and looking at the basics of our human nature\n\n1:31:04.440 --> 1:31:09.440\n and its origins in the evolution of Homo sapiens\n\n1:31:10.040 --> 1:31:14.480\n and thinking about which kind of aspects of human nature\n\n1:31:14.480 --> 1:31:18.200\n if we get rid of them will make for a better world.\n\n1:31:18.200 --> 1:31:20.240\n It's an interesting thought experiment worth thinking about.\n\n1:31:20.240 --> 1:31:21.680\n But it is only a thought experiment.\n\n1:31:21.680 --> 1:31:24.840\n I mean, you know, it's got no practical meaning right now.\n\n1:31:24.840 --> 1:31:28.320\n And I take your point that, you know,\n\n1:31:28.320 --> 1:31:32.480\n males get a hard rap nowadays in some ways\n\n1:31:32.480 --> 1:31:37.480\n because the balance of social power\n\n1:31:38.680 --> 1:31:42.580\n is moving against,\n\n1:31:42.580 --> 1:31:45.580\n I mean, you know, quite rightly\n\n1:31:45.580 --> 1:31:47.140\n and in a strong sense, of course,\n\n1:31:47.140 --> 1:31:50.060\n against all the nasty things that males do.\n\n1:31:51.600 --> 1:31:55.740\n But what people sometimes fail to remember\n\n1:31:55.740 --> 1:32:00.660\n is that life is very hard for males\n\n1:32:00.660 --> 1:32:03.660\n who don't have the power,\n\n1:32:03.660 --> 1:32:06.300\n who don't have money,\n\n1:32:06.300 --> 1:32:08.920\n who don't have access to women.\n\n1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:13.680\n And, you know, I'm sympathetic to incels.\n\n1:32:15.040 --> 1:32:18.400\n I'm not sympathetic to them using violence\n\n1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:20.200\n to solve their problems.\n\n1:32:20.200 --> 1:32:23.240\n But I am very sympathetic to the fact that\n\n1:32:24.200 --> 1:32:27.200\n it's not easy simply to be told by\n\n1:32:29.700 --> 1:32:34.700\n well off, feminist, middle class people\n\n1:32:36.500 --> 1:32:38.080\n that you shouldn't behave like this\n\n1:32:38.080 --> 1:32:40.360\n or you shouldn't feel like this because you do.\n\n1:32:40.360 --> 1:32:42.400\n Yes, it's who you are.\n\n1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:45.960\n I mean, in general, just empathy and kindness,\n\n1:32:46.960 --> 1:32:48.680\n male or female,\n\n1:32:51.080 --> 1:32:54.400\n I believe will be the thing that builds a better world.\n\n1:32:54.400 --> 1:32:57.360\n And that's practiced in different ways\n\n1:32:57.360 --> 1:32:58.680\n from different backgrounds.\n\n1:32:58.680 --> 1:33:01.600\n But ultimately, you should listen to others\n\n1:33:01.600 --> 1:33:04.120\n and empathize with the experience of others\n\n1:33:04.120 --> 1:33:06.480\n and put more love out there in the world.\n\n1:33:06.480 --> 1:33:09.380\n Now, that hopefully is the way to reduce conflict,\n\n1:33:10.280 --> 1:33:12.320\n reduce violence,\n\n1:33:12.320 --> 1:33:17.320\n and reduce that whole psychological experience\n\n1:33:18.200 --> 1:33:19.800\n of being powerless in this world,\n\n1:33:19.800 --> 1:33:22.520\n powerless to become the best version of yourself.\n\n1:33:22.520 --> 1:33:23.360\n And that, you know.\n\n1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:24.440\n Well, no one's gonna disagree\n\n1:33:24.440 --> 1:33:27.160\n with all those fine sentiments, right?\n\n1:33:27.160 --> 1:33:29.680\n But that, yes.\n\n1:33:29.680 --> 1:33:32.000\n But that's an actionable thing\n\n1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:35.120\n is actually practice empathy, right?\n\n1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:40.080\n Like saying that somebody should be silenced\n\n1:33:40.080 --> 1:33:43.780\n or just like this group is bad and this group is good.\n\n1:33:43.780 --> 1:33:45.360\n I just feel like that's not empathy.\n\n1:33:45.360 --> 1:33:50.360\n Empathy is understanding the experience of others\n\n1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:52.960\n and like respecting it.\n\n1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:57.240\n Like, I mean, that's what a better world looks like.\n\n1:33:57.240 --> 1:33:59.720\n That's what the reduction of conflict looks like.\n\n1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:03.680\n It's like, as opposed to saying my tribe is right,\n\n1:34:03.680 --> 1:34:05.220\n your tribe is wrong.\n\n1:34:06.360 --> 1:34:08.720\n Forget the violence and nonviolence part.\n\n1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:11.160\n That's just that act of saying my tribe is right,\n\n1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:12.220\n that tribe is wrong.\n\n1:34:12.220 --> 1:34:13.600\n Removing that from the picture,\n\n1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:15.720\n that's the way to make a better world.\n\n1:34:15.720 --> 1:34:18.320\n Like that's the way to reduce the violence, I think.\n\n1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:21.720\n Not necessarily removing the people\n\n1:34:21.720 --> 1:34:24.160\n who are causing the violence.\n\n1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:25.960\n You have to get to the source of the problem.\n\n1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:27.240\n I don't mean the evolutionary source,\n\n1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:32.240\n but just the mindset that creates the violence\n\n1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:35.960\n is usually just the lack of empathy for others.\n\n1:34:37.800 --> 1:34:40.480\n Yeah, but you know, I mean, you can't just teach that\n\n1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:43.560\n because our evolutionary psychology\n\n1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:45.520\n puts us in particular directions.\n\n1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:48.640\n So you don't think, do you think it's possible\n\n1:34:48.640 --> 1:34:53.640\n to learn through practice to resist the basics\n\n1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.920\n of our evolutionary psychology, the basic forces?\n\n1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:01.880\n Yeah, I mean, lots and lots of training.\n\n1:35:01.880 --> 1:35:04.920\n Lots and lots of education can do it.\n\n1:35:04.920 --> 1:35:09.200\n The famously most peaceful society\n\n1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:11.840\n that anthropologists have recorded\n\n1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:16.840\n involves tremendous amount of teaching,\n\n1:35:16.840 --> 1:35:18.880\n including some punishment.\n\n1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:20.920\n You know, it's a society in Thailand.\n\n1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:25.920\n You have to beat it out of children to make them nice.\n\n1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:27.760\n There's carrot and steak.\n\n1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:31.280\n You know, the point is that you do not find societies\n\n1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:34.360\n in which people are spontaneously\n\n1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:39.200\n showing the kinds of behaviors\n\n1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:42.040\n that we would all love them to show.\n\n1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:43.320\n It requires work.\n\n1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:45.160\n It requires work.\n\n1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:48.000\n What is your book titled, Goodness Paradox?\n\n1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.360\n What are the main ideas in this book?\n\n1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:55.360\n Well, the paradox is the fact that humans show extremes\n\n1:35:56.720 --> 1:36:00.480\n in relationship to both violence and nonviolence.\n\n1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:04.240\n And the violence is that we are one of these few animals\n\n1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:08.920\n in which we use coalitionary proactive violence\n\n1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:10.720\n to kill members of our own species.\n\n1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:12.240\n And we do it in large numbers,\n\n1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:14.760\n just like a few other species.\n\n1:36:14.760 --> 1:36:18.960\n And the nonviolence is we're particularly extreme\n\n1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:23.920\n in how repressed we are in terms of reactive violence.\n\n1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:26.960\n And I told you the story of how we get there.\n\n1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:29.120\n So what's so extraordinary about it is that\n\n1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:32.960\n most animals are either high on both\n\n1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:35.440\n or relatively low on both.\n\n1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:38.360\n So chimpanzees are high on proactive violence\n\n1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:40.040\n and reactive violence.\n\n1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:44.240\n Bonobos are less than chimpanzees on both of those,\n\n1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:46.360\n but still hundreds of times more\n\n1:36:47.640 --> 1:36:49.920\n reactively aggressive than humans are.\n\n1:36:50.960 --> 1:36:54.960\n What we've done is retain proactive violence being high\n\n1:36:54.960 --> 1:36:59.240\n and got reactive violence really being low.\n\n1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:01.200\n And so we have these wonderful societies\n\n1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:03.800\n in which we're all so incredibly nice to each other\n\n1:37:03.800 --> 1:37:07.080\n and tolerant and calm and can meet strangers\n\n1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:08.880\n and have no problem about\n\n1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:14.760\n leading to any kind of conflict\n\n1:37:14.760 --> 1:37:18.240\n at the same time as we are one of the worst\n\n1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:21.840\n killing machine species that's ever existed.\n\n1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:24.240\n So what's so extraordinary about this is that\n\n1:37:24.240 --> 1:37:26.880\n if you look at the political philosophers\n\n1:37:26.880 --> 1:37:28.920\n of the last few hundred years,\n\n1:37:29.800 --> 1:37:33.880\n you've got this fight famously between Thomas Hobbes\n\n1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:35.240\n and Jean Jacques Rousseau,\n\n1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:38.400\n or literally you've got the fight between their followers.\n\n1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:40.720\n So the followers of Hobbes say,\n\n1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:41.960\n well, Hobbes was right,\n\n1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:44.200\n because he says that we are naturally violent\n\n1:37:44.200 --> 1:37:46.360\n and you need a Leviathan,\n\n1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:49.280\n a sort of central government or a king\n\n1:37:49.280 --> 1:37:51.640\n to be able to suppress the violence.\n\n1:37:51.640 --> 1:37:53.560\n So we're naturally horrid\n\n1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:55.800\n and we can learn to be good.\n\n1:37:55.800 --> 1:37:58.200\n Whereas Jean Jacques Rousseau is interpreted\n\n1:37:58.200 --> 1:37:59.760\n as saying the opposite,\n\n1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:01.320\n that we are naturally good\n\n1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:03.360\n and it's only when culture intervenes\n\n1:38:03.360 --> 1:38:05.960\n and horrid ideologies come in\n\n1:38:05.960 --> 1:38:08.280\n that we become uncivilized.\n\n1:38:08.280 --> 1:38:10.840\n And so people have had this endless fight\n\n1:38:10.840 --> 1:38:13.680\n between are we naturally corrupt\n\n1:38:13.680 --> 1:38:17.280\n or are we naturally kind?\n\n1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:19.640\n And that has gone on for years\n\n1:38:19.640 --> 1:38:22.960\n and it's only in the last two or three decades\n\n1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:25.160\n that anthropologists like Christopher Boehm\n\n1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:26.520\n and Bruce Naft have said,\n\n1:38:26.520 --> 1:38:28.600\n look, it's obvious what the answer is,\n\n1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:30.320\n we are both of these things.\n\n1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:32.120\n And what is so exciting now\n\n1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:34.840\n is I think we can understand why we are both.\n\n1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:38.160\n And the answer is we come from ancestors\n\n1:38:38.160 --> 1:38:40.680\n that were elevated on proactive aggression,\n\n1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:43.680\n that were hunters and killers,\n\n1:38:43.680 --> 1:38:46.480\n both of animals and of each other.\n\n1:38:47.320 --> 1:38:49.080\n And you've got to include that\n\n1:38:49.080 --> 1:38:52.840\n as almost certain from the past.\n\n1:38:52.840 --> 1:38:57.840\n And then now we've taken our reactive aggression\n\n1:38:57.880 --> 1:39:00.480\n and we've down regulated it\n\n1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:02.480\n and that's given us power.\n\n1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:04.520\n It's given us power because\n\n1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:06.640\n once you get rid of the alpha male,\n\n1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:08.520\n once the beta males take over\n\n1:39:08.520 --> 1:39:13.320\n and force selection in favor of a more tolerant,\n\n1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:17.040\n less reactively aggressive individual,\n\n1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:21.960\n the effect is that our cultures suddenly become capable\n\n1:39:21.960 --> 1:39:24.880\n of focusing on things other than conflict.\n\n1:39:24.880 --> 1:39:27.680\n And so we have social groups\n\n1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:30.920\n in which individuals, instead of constantly being on edge\n\n1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:33.280\n in the way that chimpanzees are with each other,\n\n1:39:34.440 --> 1:39:39.440\n are able to interact in ways that enable them to share\n\n1:39:39.720 --> 1:39:44.000\n looking at a tool together or share their food together\n\n1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:47.200\n or pass ideas from one to the other\n\n1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:49.520\n or support each other when they're ill\n\n1:39:49.520 --> 1:39:51.600\n or whatever the issue is.\n\n1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:56.080\n Cooperate in ways that make the group far more effective.\n\n1:39:56.080 --> 1:39:58.360\n So you asked earlier, what did I think about\n\n1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:01.640\n why sapiens were able to expand\n\n1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:04.200\n at the expense of Neanderthals so dramatically\n\n1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:06.640\n around 40,000 years ago?\n\n1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:11.240\n And the answer is that whatever it was,\n\n1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:12.680\n it had something to do\n\n1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:16.040\n with the sapiens ability to cooperate.\n\n1:40:16.040 --> 1:40:18.200\n That was what gave them bigger groups.\n\n1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:21.640\n That's what enabled them to have\n\n1:40:21.640 --> 1:40:23.800\n a far more effective way of living.\n\n1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:26.160\n And I suspect it was to do with the weapons\n\n1:40:26.160 --> 1:40:28.200\n and military aspects.\n\n1:40:28.200 --> 1:40:30.200\n But even if it wasn't that,\n\n1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:35.080\n the greater cooperation that sapiens were showing\n\n1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:36.840\n would have been hugely important.\n\n1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:39.280\n So sapiens then had groups of,\n\n1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:42.040\n who knows exactly how big they were,\n\n1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:48.360\n but scores of people to judge from their remains.\n\n1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:52.800\n Whereas Neanderthals were living in widely separated,\n\n1:40:52.800 --> 1:40:57.800\n small groups of maybe as many as 15 or 20 people sometimes,\n\n1:40:58.760 --> 1:41:00.760\n where they saw others so rarely\n\n1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:03.880\n that they were inbreeding at high levels.\n\n1:41:03.880 --> 1:41:07.160\n Fathers having babies with their daughters.\n\n1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:09.720\n Very different world.\n\n1:41:09.720 --> 1:41:10.680\n Very different world.\n\n1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:12.280\n And that's probably what our world was like\n\n1:41:12.280 --> 1:41:13.640\n before we got sapiens.\n\n1:41:13.640 --> 1:41:14.920\n Before we got sapiens.\n\n1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:18.320\n And it's fascinating that there was that kind of violence\n\n1:41:18.320 --> 1:41:23.320\n against, once you get rid of the alpha males,\n\n1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:29.400\n you have now the freedom to have kindness amongst the beta.\n\n1:41:29.880 --> 1:41:31.360\n The beta males.\n\n1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:34.480\n Not kindness, but collaboration, that's the better word.\n\n1:41:34.480 --> 1:41:36.520\n Yes, right, much more corruption.\n\n1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:38.920\n Not just among the males, among the beta males,\n\n1:41:38.920 --> 1:41:42.760\n but also among the gamma males and the females.\n\n1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:44.880\n Yeah, I don't know what a gamma male is,\n\n1:41:44.880 --> 1:41:47.560\n but I imagine there's a whole alphabet.\n\n1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:48.760\n Well, I don't know about a whole alphabet,\n\n1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:52.400\n but I think the big layers are the married men\n\n1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:55.040\n and the unmarried men.\n\n1:41:55.040 --> 1:41:57.280\n Because the married men had a problem\n\n1:41:57.280 --> 1:41:59.200\n with the unmarried men, right?\n\n1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:01.200\n I mean, you see it in ethnographies\n\n1:42:01.200 --> 1:42:03.240\n of hunters and gatherers recently,\n\n1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:06.360\n where the unmarried men would be given rules,\n\n1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:09.720\n such as, I mean, a very extreme rule in Northern Australia\n\n1:42:09.720 --> 1:42:13.680\n was you cannot come to the camp for months.\n\n1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:17.280\n You have to go away and live somewhere out in the bush.\n\n1:42:17.280 --> 1:42:20.000\n Because we don't want you anywhere near our wives.\n\n1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.960\n And then another kind of rule is,\n\n1:42:23.840 --> 1:42:25.000\n if you are in the camp,\n\n1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.680\n you must be in the firelight all the time.\n\n1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:30.720\n Otherwise, we don't know what you're doing out in the dark.\n\n1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:33.880\n You really have to control them\n\n1:42:33.880 --> 1:42:36.920\n because the men who had lots of wives\n\n1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:38.640\n did not want those horrid bachelors\n\n1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:40.280\n sneaking around the place.\n\n1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:41.120\n I love this.\n\n1:42:42.200 --> 1:42:45.000\n You also wrote the book titled Catching Fire,\n\n1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:46.520\n How Cooking Made Us Human.\n\n1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:49.800\n What's the central idea in this book?\n\n1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:52.480\n The subtitle How Cooking Made Us Human\n\n1:42:52.480 --> 1:42:56.320\n refers not to Homo sapiens, but to Homo erectus.\n\n1:42:56.320 --> 1:42:59.040\n So human there means the genus Homo.\n\n1:42:59.960 --> 1:43:03.720\n And Homo erectus is the first full member\n\n1:43:03.720 --> 1:43:08.720\n of the genus Homo in the sense that it looked like us,\n\n1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:12.160\n just with a sort of slightly more robust build\n\n1:43:12.160 --> 1:43:14.120\n and a smaller brain.\n\n1:43:15.160 --> 1:43:17.360\n And the central idea of Catching Fire\n\n1:43:17.360 --> 1:43:22.040\n is that it was the control of fire\n\n1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:27.040\n that was responsible for the emergence of Homo erectus\n\n1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:30.760\n and therefore the genus Homo,\n\n1:43:30.760 --> 1:43:33.000\n which happened two million years ago.\n\n1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:38.000\n And it was an evolution from a line of Australopithecines.\n\n1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:46.360\n And Australopithecines are the creatures\n\n1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:49.360\n from whom we evolved.\n\n1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:52.840\n They were present in Africa\n\n1:43:52.840 --> 1:43:57.080\n from something like six or seven million years ago,\n\n1:43:57.080 --> 1:44:00.720\n up to actually up to one million years ago.\n\n1:44:00.720 --> 1:44:04.080\n And then a branch led off to Homo\n\n1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:05.720\n around two million years ago.\n\n1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:09.400\n And the way to think of Australopithecines\n\n1:44:09.400 --> 1:44:13.360\n is that they were like chimpanzees standing upright.\n\n1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:16.360\n So they were erect bipedal walkers.\n\n1:44:17.960 --> 1:44:20.400\n They were like chimpanzees in the sense\n\n1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:24.600\n that they had brains about the size of a chimpanzee.\n\n1:44:24.600 --> 1:44:27.360\n They were literally about the body size of a chimpanzee,\n\n1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:29.760\n a little bit smaller actually.\n\n1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:32.320\n And they had big jaws\n\n1:44:32.320 --> 1:44:36.640\n because they were still eating raw food.\n\n1:44:36.640 --> 1:44:39.400\n They had big teeth and big jaws.\n\n1:44:39.400 --> 1:44:41.600\n And then around two million years ago,\n\n1:44:42.520 --> 1:44:44.080\n the line of Australopithecines,\n\n1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:46.920\n which ended with an intermediate species,\n\n1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:48.240\n a kind of missing link area,\n\n1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:52.840\n because it is not missing, called habilis,\n\n1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:54.360\n sometimes called Homo habilis,\n\n1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:55.920\n but more properly, in my view,\n\n1:44:55.920 --> 1:44:57.720\n called Australopithecus habilis.\n\n1:44:57.720 --> 1:45:00.840\n That gave rise to Homo erectus.\n\n1:45:00.840 --> 1:45:04.480\n And Homo erectus, here's how different it was.\n\n1:45:04.480 --> 1:45:08.240\n It had a smaller mouth,\n\n1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:11.600\n a smaller jaw, smaller teeth,\n\n1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:16.120\n and to judge from its ribs and pelvis, smaller gut.\n\n1:45:17.840 --> 1:45:21.800\n In addition, it had lost what Australopithecines all had,\n\n1:45:21.800 --> 1:45:24.800\n which was adaptations for climbing in the trees.\n\n1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:26.920\n And that meant that Homo erectus must have slept\n\n1:45:26.920 --> 1:45:27.760\n on the ground.\n\n1:45:28.920 --> 1:45:31.320\n And since it slept on the ground,\n\n1:45:31.320 --> 1:45:33.400\n it should have been able to defend itself somehow\n\n1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:34.720\n against predators.\n\n1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:36.840\n And I can't think of any way they could have done that\n\n1:45:36.840 --> 1:45:38.040\n unless they had fire.\n\n1:45:40.040 --> 1:45:45.040\n So there are two major clues to why it was\n\n1:45:46.040 --> 1:45:49.160\n with Homo erectus that our ancestors\n\n1:45:49.160 --> 1:45:52.280\n first acquired the control of fire.\n\n1:45:52.280 --> 1:45:55.720\n One is the fact that they were clearly not sleeping in trees\n\n1:45:55.720 --> 1:45:58.720\n in the way that chimpanzees and gorillas and bonobos\n\n1:45:58.720 --> 1:46:01.000\n and all the other primates do.\n\n1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:07.400\n And the other is that there was this striking reduction\n\n1:46:08.120 --> 1:46:10.160\n throughout the gut,\n\n1:46:10.160 --> 1:46:14.440\n reduction in size of the mouth and the chewing apparatus\n\n1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:16.400\n and in the gut itself.\n\n1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:20.320\n And that conforms to what we have today,\n\n1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:24.880\n that conforms to what we see nowadays about humans,\n\n1:46:24.880 --> 1:46:28.640\n which is that our guts are about two thirds of the size\n\n1:46:28.640 --> 1:46:32.040\n of what they would be if we ate raw food\n\n1:46:32.040 --> 1:46:34.480\n to judge by the great apes.\n\n1:46:35.400 --> 1:46:38.600\n So at some point in our evolution,\n\n1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:43.160\n we acquired the skill of cooking\n\n1:46:43.160 --> 1:46:44.880\n and skill of controlling fire.\n\n1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:49.560\n At no time between two million years ago and the present,\n\n1:46:49.560 --> 1:46:52.840\n do we see any changes in our anatomy\n\n1:46:52.840 --> 1:46:57.840\n that can, as it were, justify the enormous change\n\n1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:01.280\n that happens when you are an animal\n\n1:47:01.280 --> 1:47:03.200\n that learns to control fire.\n\n1:47:03.200 --> 1:47:04.360\n But at two million years ago,\n\n1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:06.280\n we have exactly what you'd expect,\n\n1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:08.880\n namely the guts becoming smaller\n\n1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:11.000\n because the food is becoming softer\n\n1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:12.680\n and much more easy to digest\n\n1:47:12.680 --> 1:47:14.720\n so you don't have to work so hard in the kitchen\n\n1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:17.560\n or so hard in your body to digest it.\n\n1:47:17.560 --> 1:47:21.640\n And as I say, a commitment to sleeping on the ground,\n\n1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:26.000\n which I think you'd be absolutely crazy to do nowadays\n\n1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:30.200\n on a moonless night in the middle of Serengeti\n\n1:47:30.200 --> 1:47:31.680\n unless you had fire.\n\n1:47:31.680 --> 1:47:34.840\n I've slept out quite a lot in various parts of Africa\n\n1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:38.320\n in the bush and you will not catch me\n\n1:47:38.320 --> 1:47:42.880\n just lying on the ground in an area with lots of predators\n\n1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:44.320\n unless I got a fire with me.\n\n1:47:44.320 --> 1:47:46.160\n I'm going to get eaten.\n\n1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:49.120\n You're gonna get terrified and you're gonna get eaten.\n\n1:47:49.120 --> 1:47:51.960\n Okay, so there's a million questions I wanna ask.\n\n1:47:51.960 --> 1:47:55.840\n So one, is it very naturally coupled,\n\n1:47:55.840 --> 1:47:59.500\n the discovery of controlled fire and cooking with fire?\n\n1:47:59.500 --> 1:48:01.440\n Is that an obvious leap?\n\n1:48:01.440 --> 1:48:03.280\n Well, here's what we know.\n\n1:48:03.280 --> 1:48:06.800\n We know that all the animals that we've tested\n\n1:48:06.800 --> 1:48:10.640\n like to eat their food cooked more than they like it raw.\n\n1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:13.120\n So this is true for all the great apes.\n\n1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:14.260\n We've tested them.\n\n1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:17.320\n That's fascinating, by the way.\n\n1:48:17.320 --> 1:48:18.440\n Why is that?\n\n1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:21.000\n That's just like a property of food, I suppose.\n\n1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:25.880\n Yes, I think what it is is that animals are always looking\n\n1:48:25.880 --> 1:48:30.880\n for any kind of way to get food that is easier to digest.\n\n1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:33.760\n And there are various signals in the food\n\n1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:35.760\n such as the amount of sugar there,\n\n1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:37.920\n the amount of free amino acids\n\n1:48:37.920 --> 1:48:40.740\n because the amino acids can be tasted.\n\n1:48:40.740 --> 1:48:44.660\n And the physical qualities of the food\n\n1:48:44.660 --> 1:48:47.460\n be particularly important, how tough the food is.\n\n1:48:47.460 --> 1:48:52.140\n Always prefer softer food, provided it feels safe,\n\n1:48:52.140 --> 1:48:53.860\n tastes safe.\n\n1:48:53.860 --> 1:48:57.780\n And these kinds of sensory cues\n\n1:48:57.780 --> 1:49:01.140\n are all there in cooked food.\n\n1:49:01.140 --> 1:49:04.900\n It's soft, it doesn't have so many toxins.\n\n1:49:04.900 --> 1:49:08.480\n It's not so noxious to taste, easier to chew.\n\n1:49:08.480 --> 1:49:11.940\n So everyone loves it spontaneously.\n\n1:49:11.940 --> 1:49:14.500\n Your dogs and your cats prefer cooked food to raw food.\n\n1:49:14.500 --> 1:49:16.580\n Well, maybe you can say that's a consequence\n\n1:49:16.580 --> 1:49:19.020\n of domestication, but even, as I say,\n\n1:49:19.020 --> 1:49:23.060\n all of the great apes, you test naive ones\n\n1:49:23.060 --> 1:49:25.300\n and they prefer it cooked if they can.\n\n1:49:25.300 --> 1:49:28.020\n So then obvious, once you have fire,\n\n1:49:28.020 --> 1:49:29.620\n you're going to accidentally discover\n\n1:49:29.620 --> 1:49:32.540\n that food changes when you apply fire to it\n\n1:49:32.540 --> 1:49:37.260\n and then it's going to be the big, crazy new fad.\n\n1:49:37.260 --> 1:49:38.980\n You took the words out of my mouth.\n\n1:49:38.980 --> 1:49:41.180\n I mean, if they have fire at all\n\n1:49:41.180 --> 1:49:43.580\n and their food rolls into it,\n\n1:49:43.580 --> 1:49:46.860\n five minutes later it tastes better than it did before.\n\n1:49:46.860 --> 1:49:50.380\n How big of an invention from an engineering perspective\n\n1:49:50.380 --> 1:49:53.060\n do you think is the discovery of fire?\n\n1:49:53.060 --> 1:49:58.060\n Do you think for homo erectus, homo sapiens,\n\n1:50:00.300 --> 1:50:02.700\n do you think it's the greatest invention ever?\n\n1:50:02.700 --> 1:50:07.700\n Yeah, I think that the control of fire\n\n1:50:09.820 --> 1:50:14.300\n has been ultimately responsible for essentially\n\n1:50:15.780 --> 1:50:17.900\n how grandiose do I want to be here,\n\n1:50:17.900 --> 1:50:21.820\n the entire human story, going back to homo.\n\n1:50:21.820 --> 1:50:26.320\n It is what changed us from being a regular kind of animal.\n\n1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:30.400\n And perhaps the biggest way in which it is likely\n\n1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:35.140\n to have changed us is it reduced the difficulty\n\n1:50:35.140 --> 1:50:36.820\n of making a large brain.\n\n1:50:38.180 --> 1:50:43.180\n So the story here is that the constraints\n\n1:50:43.260 --> 1:50:46.040\n on brain size are energetic.\n\n1:50:47.820 --> 1:50:51.500\n You and I have brains that are something\n\n1:50:51.500 --> 1:50:55.860\n like 2.5% of our body weight.\n\n1:50:55.860 --> 1:51:00.860\n It consumes around 25% of all of our calories.\n\n1:51:03.540 --> 1:51:05.500\n So it's disproportionate.\n\n1:51:05.500 --> 1:51:08.620\n There are other expensive organs in our body as well,\n\n1:51:08.620 --> 1:51:09.760\n such as the heart.\n\n1:51:11.580 --> 1:51:16.580\n And what's different about the brain is that in addition\n\n1:51:16.700 --> 1:51:19.100\n to us being able to fuel it in a way\n\n1:51:19.100 --> 1:51:22.820\n that other animals can't, we also have reasons\n\n1:51:22.820 --> 1:51:24.980\n for wanting to have an even bigger brain,\n\n1:51:24.980 --> 1:51:27.020\n whereas we don't want an even bigger heart.\n\n1:51:29.020 --> 1:51:31.020\n So what those reasons are is unclear.\n\n1:51:31.020 --> 1:51:36.020\n But with regard to the costs of maintaining a brain,\n\n1:51:36.760 --> 1:51:38.580\n cooking makes it possible\n\n1:51:38.580 --> 1:51:42.600\n because it's supplying more calories\n\n1:51:42.600 --> 1:51:46.020\n and it is enormously reducing the amount of time\n\n1:51:46.020 --> 1:51:48.500\n that it takes to chew your food.\n\n1:51:48.500 --> 1:51:51.820\n So if you were a gorilla and you wanted\n\n1:51:51.820 --> 1:51:54.220\n to have a bigger brain, you might say, okay,\n\n1:51:54.220 --> 1:51:55.800\n well, let's just eat some more.\n\n1:51:56.860 --> 1:52:01.860\n But gorillas are eating for pretty much the entire day\n\n1:52:02.660 --> 1:52:04.740\n in the sense that they are eating\n\n1:52:04.740 --> 1:52:09.620\n for maybe seven or eight hours a day in some seasons.\n\n1:52:10.460 --> 1:52:11.300\n That's just chewing.\n\n1:52:11.300 --> 1:52:13.660\n And then they've got to sit around and digest their food\n\n1:52:13.660 --> 1:52:15.620\n because they can't just eat all the time.\n\n1:52:15.620 --> 1:52:20.620\n They've got to take a break while the food is digested\n\n1:52:20.660 --> 1:52:23.780\n in the stomach and then passed into the gut.\n\n1:52:23.780 --> 1:52:25.840\n So the stomach is already full.\n\n1:52:26.900 --> 1:52:29.060\n So basically gorillas are eating\n\n1:52:29.060 --> 1:52:31.220\n about the maximum rate already.\n\n1:52:31.220 --> 1:52:33.500\n So how does a gorilla get a bigger brain?\n\n1:52:33.500 --> 1:52:36.060\n It doesn't, it's actually got a smaller brain\n\n1:52:36.060 --> 1:52:39.100\n relative to its body size than a chimpanzee does.\n\n1:52:39.100 --> 1:52:44.100\n And that's the basic problem for our ancestors.\n\n1:52:44.320 --> 1:52:47.200\n Then you come along and cook and all of a sudden\n\n1:52:47.200 --> 1:52:50.900\n you can get an increased amount of energy from your food.\n\n1:52:50.900 --> 1:52:55.900\n You are spending much less energy on digesting your food.\n\n1:52:56.260 --> 1:53:00.300\n You know, there are 25 bodily processes or more\n\n1:53:00.300 --> 1:53:03.220\n that are involved in digesting your food,\n\n1:53:03.220 --> 1:53:06.940\n making the acid that takes the proteins apart,\n\n1:53:07.980 --> 1:53:12.020\n maintaining the brush border where the molecules\n\n1:53:12.020 --> 1:53:14.140\n are taken across the gut wall and so on.\n\n1:53:15.020 --> 1:53:16.300\n That all costs.\n\n1:53:16.300 --> 1:53:17.900\n It costs you to digest your food.\n\n1:53:17.900 --> 1:53:19.580\n It costs less if you cook your food.\n\n1:53:19.580 --> 1:53:22.780\n So you get a net gain in the amount of energy\n\n1:53:22.780 --> 1:53:25.700\n and you are reducing the amount of time\n\n1:53:25.700 --> 1:53:29.100\n from in our case, our ancestors,\n\n1:53:29.100 --> 1:53:32.940\n probably around 50% of the day chewing\n\n1:53:32.940 --> 1:53:36.460\n to nowadays one hour a day chewing.\n\n1:53:36.460 --> 1:53:38.260\n So all of a sudden you've got hours a day\n\n1:53:38.260 --> 1:53:41.660\n in which to do other things and to use those brains\n\n1:53:41.660 --> 1:53:44.220\n that you've now enabled to grow.\n\n1:53:44.220 --> 1:53:46.980\n So with Homo erectus, you start the process\n\n1:53:46.980 --> 1:53:49.260\n of getting a bigger brain and famously,\n\n1:53:49.260 --> 1:53:51.180\n throughout the whole period of the evolution\n\n1:53:51.180 --> 1:53:54.460\n of the genus Homo, you have a steadily increasing\n\n1:53:54.460 --> 1:53:59.220\n size of brain until right at the end\n\n1:53:59.220 --> 1:54:02.340\n when it actually gets smaller, but that's a different story.\n\n1:54:02.340 --> 1:54:03.940\n Which end is this?\n\n1:54:03.940 --> 1:54:06.140\n Which, are we talking about Homo sapiens?\n\n1:54:06.140 --> 1:54:09.620\n Yeah, with Homo sapiens, you've got a smaller brain\n\n1:54:09.620 --> 1:54:13.100\n from, people haven't got it exactly down,\n\n1:54:13.100 --> 1:54:17.140\n but at least 30,000 years ago, it starts declining.\n\n1:54:17.140 --> 1:54:20.300\n And so the fascinating thing about that\n\n1:54:20.300 --> 1:54:23.300\n is that all domesticated animals have smaller brains\n\n1:54:23.300 --> 1:54:25.340\n than their wild ancestors.\n\n1:54:25.340 --> 1:54:27.140\n And I.\n\n1:54:30.620 --> 1:54:32.700\n The domestication is intricately connected\n\n1:54:32.700 --> 1:54:34.140\n to this brain size, you think?\n\n1:54:34.140 --> 1:54:37.020\n And exactly, so I think what we're seeing in humans\n\n1:54:37.020 --> 1:54:39.700\n is that same manifestation.\n\n1:54:39.700 --> 1:54:43.260\n And then the fascinating question is why?\n\n1:54:43.260 --> 1:54:45.540\n And the only point I would want to make about this\n\n1:54:45.540 --> 1:54:50.740\n is that there's no evidence that in the small brain\n\n1:54:50.740 --> 1:54:53.100\n domesticates, they're losing say an average\n\n1:54:53.100 --> 1:54:55.460\n about 15% of brain size.\n\n1:54:55.460 --> 1:54:57.260\n In the small brain domesticates compared\n\n1:54:57.260 --> 1:54:59.420\n to their wild ancestors, there's no indication\n\n1:54:59.420 --> 1:55:02.500\n of a loss of cognitive ability.\n\n1:55:03.500 --> 1:55:08.380\n So I think what's going on is that it's a younger brain.\n\n1:55:08.380 --> 1:55:10.540\n It's a more pedomorphic brain,\n\n1:55:10.540 --> 1:55:13.780\n looking like the juveniles of the ancestor.\n\n1:55:13.780 --> 1:55:17.340\n But just as our kids are very smart\n\n1:55:17.340 --> 1:55:19.780\n and can learn amazing things compared to adults,\n\n1:55:19.780 --> 1:55:21.700\n all they lack is wisdom and maturity,\n\n1:55:21.700 --> 1:55:25.420\n but in terms of sheer cognitive ability, they got it.\n\n1:55:25.420 --> 1:55:27.460\n And I think that's the same with domesticated animals\n\n1:55:27.460 --> 1:55:28.700\n compared to their wild ancestors,\n\n1:55:28.700 --> 1:55:32.500\n and probably therefore with Homo sapiens,\n\n1:55:32.500 --> 1:55:36.700\n say 30,000 years ago, compared to their ancestors.\n\n1:55:36.700 --> 1:55:38.860\n So we have smaller brains than Neanderthals.\n\n1:55:38.860 --> 1:55:43.340\n Size, Richard, isn't everything.\n\n1:55:43.340 --> 1:55:45.180\n Exactly.\n\n1:55:45.180 --> 1:55:47.820\n What's the connection between fire, cooking,\n\n1:55:47.820 --> 1:55:50.460\n and the eating of meat?\n\n1:55:50.460 --> 1:55:53.140\n Which came first, do you think?\n\n1:55:53.140 --> 1:55:56.900\n Humans starting to enjoy the eating of meat\n\n1:55:56.900 --> 1:56:01.420\n or the invention of fire and the use of fire for cooking?\n\n1:56:01.420 --> 1:56:04.340\n I think that fire increased the using of meat.\n\n1:56:04.340 --> 1:56:09.340\n But the fact that chimpanzees really like to hunt\n\n1:56:09.700 --> 1:56:14.460\n and kill meat, as do bonobos, certainly puts us in,\n\n1:56:14.460 --> 1:56:18.580\n so those two species have a common ancestor with us\n\n1:56:18.580 --> 1:56:20.500\n going six, seven million years ago,\n\n1:56:20.500 --> 1:56:22.180\n and it was from that common ancestor\n\n1:56:22.180 --> 1:56:24.100\n that you get the Australopithecine line.\n\n1:56:24.100 --> 1:56:26.300\n It's very likely therefore Australopithecines\n\n1:56:26.300 --> 1:56:28.260\n were eating meat when they could get it,\n\n1:56:28.260 --> 1:56:29.300\n which wouldn't be very often\n\n1:56:29.300 --> 1:56:31.940\n because they wouldn't be very good sprinters.\n\n1:56:31.940 --> 1:56:33.460\n But nevertheless, they would occasionally be able\n\n1:56:33.460 --> 1:56:36.540\n to get some meat, and I bet they loved it all the time,\n\n1:56:36.540 --> 1:56:38.260\n and basically all primates like meat\n\n1:56:38.260 --> 1:56:40.180\n if they can get it, almost all of them.\n\n1:56:41.580 --> 1:56:44.700\n But I think fire would have been very important\n\n1:56:45.580 --> 1:56:47.980\n for a couple of reasons.\n\n1:56:47.980 --> 1:56:52.980\n One is that once you eat your food cooked,\n\n1:56:52.980 --> 1:56:54.620\n then you're saving yourself time.\n\n1:56:55.540 --> 1:56:58.940\n By saving yourself time, you can free up\n\n1:57:00.660 --> 1:57:03.420\n the opportunity to go and hunt more.\n\n1:57:03.420 --> 1:57:06.300\n Because hunting is a high risk, high gain activity.\n\n1:57:07.580 --> 1:57:10.580\n There's every risk that you will get nothing\n\n1:57:10.580 --> 1:57:12.900\n on one particular afternoon that you go off\n\n1:57:13.740 --> 1:57:16.460\n looking for opportunities to kill.\n\n1:57:16.460 --> 1:57:20.020\n But it's high gain because when you do get something,\n\n1:57:20.020 --> 1:57:21.740\n you bring down a kudu,\n\n1:57:21.740 --> 1:57:24.300\n then you've got a serious amount of meat.\n\n1:57:26.340 --> 1:57:28.500\n What did males and females do\n\n1:57:28.500 --> 1:57:29.820\n with the time they were saving\n\n1:57:29.820 --> 1:57:32.620\n from not having to chew their food?\n\n1:57:32.620 --> 1:57:35.220\n I think that in the case of males,\n\n1:57:35.220 --> 1:57:36.620\n it's very reasonable to think they spent\n\n1:57:36.620 --> 1:57:39.460\n a greatly increased amount of time hunting.\n\n1:57:39.460 --> 1:57:44.180\n So chimpanzees, they hunt maybe two or three times a month,\n\n1:57:44.180 --> 1:57:46.420\n and the average hunt length is 20 minutes.\n\n1:57:47.460 --> 1:57:52.460\n With humans, they're hunting maybe 20 times a month,\n\n1:57:53.020 --> 1:57:55.700\n and the average hunt length is six hours.\n\n1:57:55.700 --> 1:57:57.700\n It's a huge difference.\n\n1:57:57.700 --> 1:58:00.340\n So, and that's possible because the time was available,\n\n1:58:00.340 --> 1:58:01.700\n because they were cooking.\n\n1:58:01.700 --> 1:58:03.340\n Less chewing, more hunting.\n\n1:58:03.340 --> 1:58:04.180\n You got it.\n\n1:58:05.020 --> 1:58:10.020\n The other thing is that the meat is so much nicer.\n\n1:58:11.260 --> 1:58:14.060\n So when a chimpanzee kills a monkey,\n\n1:58:14.060 --> 1:58:17.500\n and I mean, they are so excited about killing a monkey.\n\n1:58:17.500 --> 1:58:19.380\n They're so excited about going into the hunt,\n\n1:58:19.380 --> 1:58:21.940\n and when they make the kill,\n\n1:58:21.940 --> 1:58:23.820\n then there's screams everywhere,\n\n1:58:23.820 --> 1:58:27.380\n and some don't like to seize it and capture it\n\n1:58:27.380 --> 1:58:28.740\n and take it away from the others,\n\n1:58:28.740 --> 1:58:31.980\n and eventually the strongest one has it,\n\n1:58:31.980 --> 1:58:33.980\n and the others sit around begging\n\n1:58:33.980 --> 1:58:35.700\n and trying to get some and tear it off,\n\n1:58:35.700 --> 1:58:37.540\n and so they all love it.\n\n1:58:37.540 --> 1:58:41.420\n There are others who, he often goes to the top of a tree\n\n1:58:41.420 --> 1:58:42.500\n in order to be able to get away\n\n1:58:42.500 --> 1:58:44.540\n from all of these beggars and scavengers,\n\n1:58:44.540 --> 1:58:47.940\n and while he's there, drops of blood\n\n1:58:47.940 --> 1:58:50.260\n or little scraps will fall down to the bottom,\n\n1:58:50.260 --> 1:58:52.580\n and the junior members of society,\n\n1:58:52.580 --> 1:58:55.300\n you know, the females and young and that sort of thing,\n\n1:58:55.300 --> 1:58:58.660\n they are racing through to find a particular leaf\n\n1:58:58.660 --> 1:59:00.620\n that's got a drop of blood on it so they can lick it.\n\n1:59:00.620 --> 1:59:05.620\n I mean, they love it, but it takes them a lot of time\n\n1:59:07.500 --> 1:59:08.340\n to chew it.\n\n1:59:08.340 --> 1:59:11.380\n I mean, it's the same thing as for cooked food in general.\n\n1:59:11.380 --> 1:59:16.380\n So they are getting meat very slowly into their bodies,\n\n1:59:16.820 --> 1:59:19.500\n and there sometimes comes a time when they just say,\n\n1:59:19.500 --> 1:59:21.940\n I've had enough of this, I need real food,\n\n1:59:21.940 --> 1:59:25.820\n and they'll drop the meat and go off and eat fruit again\n\n1:59:25.820 --> 1:59:27.900\n because they can get fruit into their bodies\n\n1:59:27.900 --> 1:59:29.900\n so much faster than they can get meat.\n\n1:59:32.260 --> 1:59:34.780\n So once they're cooking, that problem is solved,\n\n1:59:34.780 --> 1:59:37.260\n and they can eat the meat much more readily.\n\n1:59:37.260 --> 1:59:40.180\n So I think that meat eating would become important\n\n1:59:40.180 --> 1:59:42.340\n for two reasons with cooking.\n\n1:59:42.340 --> 1:59:45.820\n So the key, not to oversimplify,\n\n1:59:45.820 --> 1:59:48.500\n but the key moments in human history\n\n1:59:48.500 --> 1:59:52.740\n are with Homo erectus, the discovery of fire\n\n1:59:52.740 --> 1:59:55.180\n and the use of fire for cooking,\n\n1:59:55.180 --> 2:00:00.180\n and then with Homo sapiens, the beta males\n\n2:00:00.500 --> 2:00:03.180\n killing off the alpha males so that the cooperation\n\n2:00:03.180 --> 2:00:06.940\n can exist, and cooperation leads to communication\n\n2:00:06.940 --> 2:00:09.380\n and language and ideas, the sharing of ideas,\n\n2:00:09.380 --> 2:00:10.700\n that kind of thing.\n\n2:00:10.700 --> 2:00:13.660\n Well, yes, the only thing I would modify on that\n\n2:00:13.660 --> 2:00:17.420\n is that you have to ask, how is it that the beta males\n\n2:00:17.420 --> 2:00:20.380\n were able to kill the alpha male?\n\n2:00:20.380 --> 2:00:21.220\n Right.\n\n2:00:21.220 --> 2:00:25.580\n And we now know that although chimpanzees do kill males\n\n2:00:25.580 --> 2:00:27.700\n within their own group sometimes,\n\n2:00:27.700 --> 2:00:31.180\n it's not a process of killing the alpha male.\n\n2:00:31.180 --> 2:00:32.980\n It's taking advantage of opportunity\n\n2:00:32.980 --> 2:00:36.180\n when some male gets into a bad position,\n\n2:00:36.180 --> 2:00:39.300\n but it's not a systematic ability to kill the alpha male.\n\n2:00:39.300 --> 2:00:42.780\n And you can see why, because they don't have language,\n\n2:00:42.780 --> 2:00:46.380\n and without language, it's very difficult to know\n\n2:00:46.380 --> 2:00:50.020\n how confident you can be of the support of others\n\n2:00:50.020 --> 2:00:52.900\n against a particular individual within your own group.\n\n2:00:52.900 --> 2:00:53.780\n Yes.\n\n2:00:53.780 --> 2:00:55.540\n When you're attacking someone from another group,\n\n2:00:55.540 --> 2:00:57.060\n that problem is solved.\n\n2:00:57.060 --> 2:01:02.060\n We all hate those guys, but the alpha male\n\n2:01:03.820 --> 2:01:06.580\n has got alliances within his group.\n\n2:01:06.580 --> 2:01:10.460\n Some of those allies might be willing to turn against him.\n\n2:01:11.340 --> 2:01:13.340\n Some of them might be harboring deep feelings\n\n2:01:13.340 --> 2:01:17.740\n of resentment, but how does anyone else know that?\n\n2:01:17.740 --> 2:01:20.100\n So in other words, I think that you have to have\n\n2:01:20.100 --> 2:01:23.700\n some kind of language that is pretty good\n\n2:01:23.700 --> 2:01:27.700\n to solve the problems of gaining confidence\n\n2:01:27.700 --> 2:01:32.620\n that five of you say, or some number,\n\n2:01:33.940 --> 2:01:38.420\n can trust each other in this final attack.\n\n2:01:38.420 --> 2:01:42.100\n And even nowadays, it's difficult.\n\n2:01:42.100 --> 2:01:44.260\n I mean, you mentioned Stalin.\n\n2:01:44.260 --> 2:01:48.460\n It's like, why was everybody terrified?\n\n2:01:48.460 --> 2:01:50.260\n Any dictator that takes control.\n\n2:01:50.260 --> 2:01:53.260\n Why is all of us as individuals terrified\n\n2:01:53.260 --> 2:01:55.180\n when you know there's millions of us?\n\n2:01:56.060 --> 2:01:57.060\n That's right.\n\n2:01:57.060 --> 2:02:00.060\n And so like that, we lack the language,\n\n2:02:00.060 --> 2:02:04.460\n because our basic psychology of fear overtakes us.\n\n2:02:04.460 --> 2:02:06.220\n Like, who can we talk to?\n\n2:02:06.220 --> 2:02:08.660\n Who can we talk to and not get killed ourselves?\n\n2:02:08.660 --> 2:02:10.460\n Exactly, that's right.\n\n2:02:10.460 --> 2:02:14.180\n But do you have this intuition that some kind of language\n\n2:02:14.180 --> 2:02:18.660\n was developing along with this process\n\n2:02:18.660 --> 2:02:20.180\n of beta males taking over?\n\n2:02:20.180 --> 2:02:23.740\n Yes, yes, I mean, once you have sufficient language\n\n2:02:23.740 --> 2:02:25.820\n to be able to have the beta males conspiring\n\n2:02:25.820 --> 2:02:30.100\n to kill the alpha male, then you have selection\n\n2:02:30.100 --> 2:02:33.940\n in favor of cooperation and tolerance, as we spoke about.\n\n2:02:33.940 --> 2:02:38.220\n And at that point, there will be increased ability\n\n2:02:38.220 --> 2:02:40.020\n to communicate and the language will get richer\n\n2:02:40.020 --> 2:02:41.660\n and better and better.\n\n2:02:41.660 --> 2:02:44.380\n So yes, absolutely, positive feedback loop\n\n2:02:44.380 --> 2:02:47.000\n once you get the situation started.\n\n2:02:48.300 --> 2:02:53.060\n Can you maybe comment on the full complexity\n\n2:02:53.060 --> 2:02:55.720\n and richness of the human mind through this process?\n\n2:02:55.720 --> 2:03:00.580\n We've been casually saying cooking, fire,\n\n2:03:00.580 --> 2:03:05.580\n and beta males leading to cooperation.\n\n2:03:06.420 --> 2:03:09.540\n But how does the beauty of the human mind\n\n2:03:09.540 --> 2:03:10.660\n emerge from all of this?\n\n2:03:10.660 --> 2:03:13.060\n Is there other further steps we need to understand?\n\n2:03:13.060 --> 2:03:16.500\n Or is it as simple as this language emerging\n\n2:03:16.500 --> 2:03:21.260\n from taking over the alpha male and the cooperation?\n\n2:03:21.260 --> 2:03:23.840\n Or am I also over romanticizing\n\n2:03:23.840 --> 2:03:25.780\n how amazing the human mind is?\n\n2:03:25.780 --> 2:03:27.680\n Is it just like one small step\n\n2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:30.260\n in a long journey of evolution?\n\n2:03:33.020 --> 2:03:34.600\n Well, if the beauty of the human mind\n\n2:03:34.600 --> 2:03:39.600\n is the ability of us all to be creative, to explore,\n\n2:03:48.180 --> 2:03:49.900\n that's one kind of beauty.\n\n2:03:49.900 --> 2:03:54.900\n Another kind of beauty is the empathy that we can show.\n\n2:03:56.540 --> 2:03:58.020\n And we think of that as beautiful\n\n2:03:58.020 --> 2:04:03.020\n because it is a kind of rare and special ability\n\n2:04:03.020 --> 2:04:08.020\n compared to the sort of ordinary selfishness\n\n2:04:09.260 --> 2:04:12.440\n that can commonly predominate.\n\n2:04:14.600 --> 2:04:17.260\n I suppose we have to think of different sources\n\n2:04:17.260 --> 2:04:19.100\n for those two types.\n\n2:04:22.140 --> 2:04:24.580\n I suppose a general answer is that\n\n2:04:25.800 --> 2:04:29.220\n there has been selection in favor of bigger brains,\n\n2:04:29.220 --> 2:04:31.960\n which probably in general has been associated\n\n2:04:31.960 --> 2:04:33.900\n with increasing cognitive ability.\n\n2:04:33.900 --> 2:04:35.860\n And as that has happened,\n\n2:04:37.040 --> 2:04:41.140\n the complexity of life has increased\n\n2:04:41.140 --> 2:04:45.900\n because people have more and more complex,\n\n2:04:45.900 --> 2:04:48.460\n highly differentiated strategies\n\n2:04:48.460 --> 2:04:51.340\n in response to each other's more complex,\n\n2:04:51.340 --> 2:04:53.580\n highly differentiated strategies.\n\n2:04:53.580 --> 2:04:55.820\n We get to a point where there is deception\n\n2:04:55.820 --> 2:04:57.980\n and self deception.\n\n2:04:57.980 --> 2:05:02.820\n There is a manipulation of ideas\n\n2:05:02.820 --> 2:05:07.220\n through stories that we invent and stories that we pass on.\n\n2:05:09.700 --> 2:05:12.180\n I guess all I'm wanting to say is that\n\n2:05:13.660 --> 2:05:18.660\n there is a world of the mind that evolves in response\n\n2:05:22.660 --> 2:05:25.940\n to these platforms that are put there.\n\n2:05:25.940 --> 2:05:28.780\n The platform of increasing brain size\n\n2:05:28.780 --> 2:05:30.140\n and therefore cognitive ability\n\n2:05:30.140 --> 2:05:34.140\n made possible by increased energy supply.\n\n2:05:34.140 --> 2:05:38.980\n The platform of cooperation and tolerance\n\n2:05:38.980 --> 2:05:42.940\n in a world in which there remains a lot of conflict\n\n2:05:42.940 --> 2:05:46.500\n and therefore a need to respond to the conflict\n\n2:05:46.500 --> 2:05:49.120\n and manipulate your allies appropriately.\n\n2:05:50.380 --> 2:05:52.540\n I don't see beauty as coming,\n\n2:05:52.540 --> 2:05:53.820\n either kind of beauty as coming\n\n2:05:53.820 --> 2:05:56.780\n sort of totally independently of these things.\n\n2:05:56.780 --> 2:05:58.780\n You know, I don't think there's a selection\n\n2:05:58.780 --> 2:06:02.660\n for staring into the sunset and creating poetry.\n\n2:06:02.660 --> 2:06:03.500\n Yes.\n\n2:06:03.500 --> 2:06:06.020\n You know, but I guess sexual selection,\n\n2:06:06.020 --> 2:06:09.580\n you know, males wanting to impress females\n\n2:06:09.580 --> 2:06:13.700\n in different ways will lead to them wanting to.\n\n2:06:13.700 --> 2:06:15.180\n Write poetry?\n\n2:06:15.180 --> 2:06:16.740\n Well, yes, you know, show off.\n\n2:06:16.740 --> 2:06:18.500\n Yeah, in all the different ways.\n\n2:06:18.500 --> 2:06:20.620\n So all of these are natural consequences\n\n2:06:20.620 --> 2:06:24.780\n of just coming up with strategies of how to cooperate\n\n2:06:24.780 --> 2:06:27.240\n and how to achieve certain ends.\n\n2:06:27.240 --> 2:06:28.860\n So that's just like a natural.\n\n2:06:29.820 --> 2:06:31.980\n Yeah, I mean, we haven't spoken about sexual selection,\n\n2:06:31.980 --> 2:06:34.020\n but that is a really important part of it.\n\n2:06:34.020 --> 2:06:37.340\n You know, they try to out compete each other\n\n2:06:37.340 --> 2:06:42.340\n in, you know, normally without any physical conflict,\n\n2:06:43.100 --> 2:06:45.100\n just in order to be able to be chosen\n\n2:06:45.100 --> 2:06:46.900\n by mates of the opposite sex.\n\n2:06:46.900 --> 2:06:51.240\n And that is certainly a major source of creativity.\n\n2:06:53.280 --> 2:06:56.220\n So you've studied chimps.\n\n2:06:56.220 --> 2:06:59.340\n You also, all the other relatives, gorillas.\n\n2:06:59.340 --> 2:07:01.940\n What do you find beautiful and fascinating about chimps,\n\n2:07:01.940 --> 2:07:03.780\n about gorillas, about humans?\n\n2:07:03.780 --> 2:07:07.140\n Maybe you can paint the whole picture of that evolutionary,\n\n2:07:07.140 --> 2:07:10.760\n that little local pocket of the evolutionary tree.\n\n2:07:10.760 --> 2:07:12.260\n How are we related?\n\n2:07:12.260 --> 2:07:14.180\n What is the common ancestor?\n\n2:07:14.180 --> 2:07:15.740\n What are the interesting differences?\n\n2:07:15.740 --> 2:07:17.300\n I know I'm asking a million questions,\n\n2:07:17.300 --> 2:07:22.300\n but can you paint a map of what are chimps, gorillas,\n\n2:07:22.940 --> 2:07:25.060\n and humans, like how we're related,\n\n2:07:25.060 --> 2:07:27.360\n and what you find fascinating about each?\n\n2:07:29.340 --> 2:07:32.720\n In Africa, straddling the equator,\n\n2:07:33.700 --> 2:07:37.300\n there is a strip of rainforest\n\n2:07:37.300 --> 2:07:42.300\n that relies on the combination of high temperatures\n\n2:07:42.300 --> 2:07:45.660\n and rainfall that you get around the equator.\n\n2:07:45.660 --> 2:07:50.660\n That rainforest goes into about 22 countries.\n\n2:07:51.760 --> 2:07:54.920\n And throughout those countries, you have chimpanzees,\n\n2:07:54.920 --> 2:07:57.160\n although they've gone extinct in two of them.\n\n2:07:58.800 --> 2:08:02.600\n In just a fraction of them,\n\n2:08:02.600 --> 2:08:04.720\n but it was five countries,\n\n2:08:04.720 --> 2:08:09.720\n you've got gorillas, where there are mountains.\n\n2:08:09.720 --> 2:08:12.880\n And in one country, on the left bank\n\n2:08:12.880 --> 2:08:15.860\n of the Great Congo River, you have bonobos.\n\n2:08:17.640 --> 2:08:19.020\n So in the African forest,\n\n2:08:19.020 --> 2:08:22.120\n you've got these three African apes, the only African apes,\n\n2:08:23.160 --> 2:08:28.160\n all of which are very similar in much of their way of life.\n\n2:08:30.400 --> 2:08:33.000\n They walk on their knuckles through the forest,\n\n2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:34.660\n looking for fruit trees,\n\n2:08:34.660 --> 2:08:39.660\n and eating herbs when they can't find fruits.\n\n2:08:41.320 --> 2:08:46.040\n Gorillas represent the oldest chain.\n\n2:08:46.040 --> 2:08:49.000\n So about 10 million years ago,\n\n2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:51.800\n maybe as recently as eight million years ago,\n\n2:08:51.800 --> 2:08:54.040\n the ancestor of gorillas broke off\n\n2:08:54.040 --> 2:08:57.300\n from the ancestor leading to chimps and bonobos and humans.\n\n2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:00.800\n So they've probably remained very similar now\n\n2:09:00.800 --> 2:09:04.680\n to what, very similar to what they were then.\n\n2:09:04.680 --> 2:09:08.960\n They were probably the largest apes,\n\n2:09:08.960 --> 2:09:13.840\n living in montane areas and spending more time\n\n2:09:13.840 --> 2:09:17.860\n eating just herbs, stems,\n\n2:09:19.140 --> 2:09:21.320\n not so vitally dependent on fruit.\n\n2:09:22.200 --> 2:09:26.840\n And living in, if it was like the present,\n\n2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:30.620\n groups up to about 50 stable groups,\n\n2:09:30.620 --> 2:09:34.340\n with one alpha male who was in charge.\n\n2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:42.000\n Gorillas are wonderfully slow and inquisitive\n\n2:09:44.600 --> 2:09:46.360\n compared to chimps and bonobos.\n\n2:09:46.360 --> 2:09:51.360\n And I had the privilege of spending a week or two\n\n2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:58.000\n with gorillas at Dian Fossey's camp before she was murdered.\n\n2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:03.000\n And I went out with two women,\n\n2:10:03.440 --> 2:10:07.200\n Kelly and Barb, to a particular group.\n\n2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:12.200\n And there was a young female in the group called Simba.\n\n2:10:12.200 --> 2:10:16.240\n And Simba approached us and stared at the two women.\n\n2:10:16.240 --> 2:10:18.840\n And then she came towards me\n\n2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:23.840\n and she very deliberately reached out her knuckles\n\n2:10:24.800 --> 2:10:26.680\n and touched me on the forehead.\n\n2:10:26.680 --> 2:10:31.680\n She was watched in doing this by a young male\n\n2:10:32.200 --> 2:10:34.000\n who was quite keen on her.\n\n2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:35.800\n And he was called Digit.\n\n2:10:35.800 --> 2:10:38.200\n And about five minutes later,\n\n2:10:38.200 --> 2:10:42.080\n Digit stood in front of us on the path.\n\n2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:44.760\n And Kelly was in front of me,\n\n2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:48.160\n and then there was Barb, and then there was me.\n\n2:10:48.160 --> 2:10:49.920\n And he came charging down the path\n\n2:10:49.920 --> 2:10:51.840\n and he sidestepped around Kelly,\n\n2:10:51.840 --> 2:10:53.960\n and he sidestepped around Barb,\n\n2:10:53.960 --> 2:10:57.640\n and me, he just knocked with his arm\n\n2:10:57.640 --> 2:11:00.640\n and sent me flying about five yards into the bushes.\n\n2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:05.640\n And I love the way that that was a very deliberate response.\n\n2:11:06.840 --> 2:11:10.080\n And I love the way that Simba had been so interested in me\n\n2:11:10.080 --> 2:11:12.280\n and held my eye.\n\n2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:15.040\n Chimps and bonobos never hold your eye,\n\n2:11:15.040 --> 2:11:16.680\n but gorillas really look as though\n\n2:11:16.680 --> 2:11:18.000\n they're trying to sort of figure out\n\n2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:19.200\n what are you thinking about?\n\n2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:24.200\n That was a species that has, goes back\n\n2:11:24.200 --> 2:11:26.480\n for something like 10 million years.\n\n2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:30.440\n In that situation, was there a game being played?\n\n2:11:31.840 --> 2:11:35.000\n Well, I mean, I felt that Digit was telling me,\n\n2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.240\n I don't want you messing with Simba.\n\n2:11:37.240 --> 2:11:40.280\n But was Simba using you?\n\n2:11:40.280 --> 2:11:41.520\n Oh, I see.\n\n2:11:41.520 --> 2:11:43.040\n Well, that's a fun idea.\n\n2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:45.040\n I don't see why she should be using me,\n\n2:11:45.040 --> 2:11:46.960\n but you mean to use me?\n\n2:11:46.960 --> 2:11:49.800\n I see why she should be using me, but you mean testing\n\n2:11:49.800 --> 2:11:53.240\n how strongly Digit was prepared to intervene to?\n\n2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:54.080\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:11:54.080 --> 2:11:57.400\n Oh, that's come straight out of a sort of adolescent\n\n2:11:57.400 --> 2:11:58.320\n high school playbook.\n\n2:11:58.320 --> 2:11:59.960\n All right, well, that's all.\n\n2:11:59.960 --> 2:12:02.720\n No, no, no, there's nothing wrong with it for that.\n\n2:12:02.720 --> 2:12:04.080\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n2:12:04.080 --> 2:12:06.840\n I never thought of that, and you never know.\n\n2:12:08.200 --> 2:12:09.800\n It's possible.\n\n2:12:09.800 --> 2:12:14.160\n So, yeah, so, okay, so this is an ancient branch\n\n2:12:14.160 --> 2:12:16.800\n of the evolutionary tree, this gorilla\n\n2:12:16.800 --> 2:12:17.800\n that led to gorillas.\n\n2:12:17.800 --> 2:12:19.200\n Gorillas.\n\n2:12:19.200 --> 2:12:20.720\n So then the next thing that happened\n\n2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:23.760\n on the evolutionary tree was six or seven million years ago\n\n2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:28.760\n when you have the line between chimps and bonobos\n\n2:12:30.040 --> 2:12:34.200\n on the one hand and humans on the other splitting.\n\n2:12:34.200 --> 2:12:36.880\n And basically what happened is that at that point,\n\n2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:40.760\n a chimp like ancestor leaves the forest,\n\n2:12:41.920 --> 2:12:45.240\n gets isolated in an area outside the forest and adapts,\n\n2:12:45.240 --> 2:12:46.720\n and that becomes the Australopithecines\n\n2:12:46.720 --> 2:12:50.920\n and meanwhile, the chimpanzees and bonobo ancestor\n\n2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:52.160\n continues in the forest.\n\n2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:57.720\n And later what happens is that one branch of that\n\n2:12:57.720 --> 2:13:00.160\n crosses the Congo River and becomes the bonobos.\n\n2:13:01.280 --> 2:13:02.840\n That was only about two million years ago,\n\n2:13:02.840 --> 2:13:04.240\n maybe one million years ago.\n\n2:13:05.360 --> 2:13:07.520\n Now the chimps that remained in the forest\n\n2:13:07.520 --> 2:13:09.760\n throughout this time and occupied all the countries\n\n2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:12.520\n across from west to east Africa now,\n\n2:13:13.840 --> 2:13:16.000\n again, we assume that they're pretty similar\n\n2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:18.560\n to the ones that live nowadays,\n\n2:13:18.560 --> 2:13:21.840\n where there's some variation from west to east.\n\n2:13:21.840 --> 2:13:25.840\n And these are animals that live in social communities\n\n2:13:25.840 --> 2:13:29.920\n of between say 20 and 200.\n\n2:13:29.920 --> 2:13:32.360\n They have a lot of them in one group,\n\n2:13:32.360 --> 2:13:35.240\n but they never come together in a single unit.\n\n2:13:35.240 --> 2:13:39.960\n These are, they share an area, a community territory,\n\n2:13:39.960 --> 2:13:41.800\n and that area is defended by males\n\n2:13:41.800 --> 2:13:43.800\n and within it, females wander\n\n2:13:43.800 --> 2:13:46.120\n and bring up their young independently.\n\n2:13:46.120 --> 2:13:49.880\n And the females are very scared\n\n2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:53.800\n about the possibility that males\n\n2:13:53.800 --> 2:13:55.840\n will be mean to their infants.\n\n2:13:55.840 --> 2:13:58.640\n And in order to avoid them doing that,\n\n2:13:58.640 --> 2:14:02.760\n they do their best to mate with every single male\n\n2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:04.720\n in the group multiple times,\n\n2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:07.520\n as if to give a memory in that male of,\n\n2:14:07.520 --> 2:14:09.000\n yeah, yeah, I reminded you,\n\n2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:11.600\n so I'm not gonna be mean to your baby.\n\n2:14:11.600 --> 2:14:12.960\n So what's wonderful about chimps?\n\n2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:15.200\n Well, you know, as we've spoken about them,\n\n2:14:15.200 --> 2:14:20.120\n they are creative and sort of amazingly humanlike,\n\n2:14:20.120 --> 2:14:22.800\n but I love the sort of, you know, the quiet moments.\n\n2:14:22.800 --> 2:14:24.080\n And here's one.\n\n2:14:25.760 --> 2:14:30.760\n I've got two chimps who are grooming each other\n\n2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:33.680\n on a day when they are utterly exhausted.\n\n2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:37.760\n They've walked 11 kilometers the day before,\n\n2:14:37.760 --> 2:14:39.840\n up and down hills.\n\n2:14:39.840 --> 2:14:42.200\n And on this particular day,\n\n2:14:42.200 --> 2:14:44.360\n all they do is they get to one tree\n\n2:14:44.360 --> 2:14:45.800\n and they eat from that tree.\n\n2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:48.480\n And other than that, they only walk about 100 yards\n\n2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:52.480\n and they go back to sleep in the nest in which they woke up.\n\n2:14:52.480 --> 2:14:53.840\n So they're utterly exhausted\n\n2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:56.680\n and they're just eating nonstop\n\n2:14:56.680 --> 2:14:58.960\n because they're trying to recover their energy.\n\n2:14:59.880 --> 2:15:02.840\n And this is Hugh and Charlie.\n\n2:15:02.840 --> 2:15:04.400\n And we think they were probably brothers.\n\n2:15:04.400 --> 2:15:08.520\n They've never actually got the genetic evidence to prove it.\n\n2:15:08.520 --> 2:15:11.640\n Well, I never remember now who it is,\n\n2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:16.640\n but let's say that they both come down from the tree\n\n2:15:17.040 --> 2:15:22.040\n and they're both carrying branches of the food.\n\n2:15:22.600 --> 2:15:25.080\n They're actually seeds from these branches.\n\n2:15:25.080 --> 2:15:28.240\n They're both engaged, even in the midday sun\n\n2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:31.880\n when they want to come down and unshade themselves\n\n2:15:31.880 --> 2:15:34.880\n for a bit on the ground, they're still eating.\n\n2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:38.160\n But then Charlie finishes his branch\n\n2:15:38.160 --> 2:15:42.120\n and he starts grooming Hugh.\n\n2:15:42.120 --> 2:15:47.120\n And Hugh continues eating from his branch.\n\n2:15:48.880 --> 2:15:53.240\n Charlie eventually gets bored of this after a few minutes\n\n2:15:53.240 --> 2:15:57.800\n and he reaches out and he lifts the branch\n\n2:15:57.800 --> 2:16:00.320\n from which Hugh is still taking seeds\n\n2:16:01.280 --> 2:16:05.080\n and puts it over his head and puts it behind his back\n\n2:16:05.080 --> 2:16:08.720\n as far as possible away from Hugh.\n\n2:16:08.720 --> 2:16:10.680\n Hugh doesn't do anything.\n\n2:16:10.680 --> 2:16:12.360\n He just finishes his mouthful\n\n2:16:12.360 --> 2:16:15.000\n and then he turns to Charlie and grooms him.\n\n2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:16.760\n So this very polite way of saying,\n\n2:16:16.760 --> 2:16:19.800\n will you groom me please has worked.\n\n2:16:19.800 --> 2:16:24.800\n Then Hugh grooms around Charlie's back\n\n2:16:25.480 --> 2:16:29.440\n and around to the right side and then down his arm\n\n2:16:29.440 --> 2:16:33.040\n to what point where he can reach the branch again.\n\n2:16:33.040 --> 2:16:34.720\n And then he picks up the branch\n\n2:16:34.720 --> 2:16:37.200\n and continues nonchalantly.\n\n2:16:37.200 --> 2:16:38.040\n Right.\n\n2:16:38.040 --> 2:16:42.000\n So in other words, a very sort of simple little strategy\n\n2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:43.880\n but it just shows the courtesy\n\n2:16:43.880 --> 2:16:47.080\n with which they can treat each other.\n\n2:16:47.080 --> 2:16:49.320\n And the days I love with chimps\n\n2:16:49.320 --> 2:16:50.440\n are when you see that sort of thing\n\n2:16:50.440 --> 2:16:52.640\n or when you see mothers just lying\n\n2:16:52.640 --> 2:16:55.240\n in a sunlit patch in the forest\n\n2:16:55.240 --> 2:16:58.160\n with their babies bouncing on top of them,\n\n2:16:58.160 --> 2:17:01.480\n just having a wonderful peaceful time.\n\n2:17:01.480 --> 2:17:06.080\n And that's what most of their lives are like.\n\n2:17:06.080 --> 2:17:09.680\n So chimpanzees are the species\n\n2:17:09.680 --> 2:17:11.920\n that kind of unites the rest of the apes\n\n2:17:11.920 --> 2:17:14.800\n because a gorilla is in many ways\n\n2:17:14.800 --> 2:17:16.520\n just a big version of a chimpanzee.\n\n2:17:16.520 --> 2:17:19.640\n If you can sort of engineer a chimpanzee in your mind\n\n2:17:19.640 --> 2:17:22.560\n to be bigger, it basically turns into a gorilla.\n\n2:17:22.560 --> 2:17:26.480\n And then bonobos on the left bank of the Congo River\n\n2:17:26.480 --> 2:17:31.480\n are like a domesticated form of a chimpanzee\n\n2:17:31.960 --> 2:17:33.560\n but obviously humans didn't domesticate them.\n\n2:17:33.560 --> 2:17:35.240\n So they're self domesticated.\n\n2:17:35.240 --> 2:17:36.960\n They are less aggressive\n\n2:17:36.960 --> 2:17:39.760\n and they show all the marks of domestication\n\n2:17:39.760 --> 2:17:41.680\n that domestication animals do\n\n2:17:41.680 --> 2:17:44.640\n compared to wild animals in their bones.\n\n2:17:44.640 --> 2:17:47.520\n So they have reduced differences between males and females\n\n2:17:47.520 --> 2:17:49.080\n in which the males are more like females.\n\n2:17:49.080 --> 2:17:53.000\n They have smaller brains, they have shorter faces,\n\n2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:55.600\n smaller teeth and smaller bodies.\n\n2:17:55.600 --> 2:17:57.720\n All the things that domesticated animals show.\n\n2:17:57.720 --> 2:18:01.280\n And bonobos live in this environment\n\n2:18:01.280 --> 2:18:05.480\n in a strikingly peaceful way compared to the chimpanzees.\n\n2:18:05.480 --> 2:18:08.720\n There's no indication that they will have\n\n2:18:08.720 --> 2:18:12.480\n these aggressive kills and enough data now to show\n\n2:18:12.480 --> 2:18:13.960\n that there's a statistical difference\n\n2:18:13.960 --> 2:18:16.440\n in the frequency of which it would happen.\n\n2:18:16.440 --> 2:18:21.640\n And bonobos are famously erotic.\n\n2:18:21.640 --> 2:18:26.640\n The females have enlarged sexual parts\n\n2:18:27.480 --> 2:18:30.320\n which swell to particularly large size\n\n2:18:30.320 --> 2:18:33.720\n compared to the female chimpanzees.\n\n2:18:33.720 --> 2:18:38.200\n And the females have a lot of interactions with each other\n\n2:18:38.200 --> 2:18:42.040\n in which they excitedly rub their clitorises together\n\n2:18:42.040 --> 2:18:45.320\n and appear to have orgasms.\n\n2:18:45.320 --> 2:18:47.560\n And these occur in the context\n\n2:18:47.560 --> 2:18:52.400\n of some kind of social tension.\n\n2:18:52.400 --> 2:18:53.880\n And they sometimes happen before,\n\n2:18:53.880 --> 2:18:55.760\n they sometimes happen after the social tension,\n\n2:18:55.760 --> 2:18:59.440\n and they seem to be devices, these interactions,\n\n2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:02.280\n for ensuring that everyone's friends\n\n2:19:02.280 --> 2:19:03.920\n and reducing the chances\n\n2:19:03.920 --> 2:19:05.560\n that they're actually gonna get into a fight.\n\n2:19:05.560 --> 2:19:10.560\n So it's a kind of conflict resolution through sex\n\n2:19:10.880 --> 2:19:13.120\n or some kind of pleasurable sexual experience.\n\n2:19:13.120 --> 2:19:15.800\n Well, it's often characterized as make love, not war.\n\n2:19:15.800 --> 2:19:18.280\n Make love, not war.\n\n2:19:18.280 --> 2:19:22.960\n Okay, you mentioned to me offline\n\n2:19:22.960 --> 2:19:25.600\n that you have a deep love for nature.\n\n2:19:26.720 --> 2:19:28.400\n If we look at the world today,\n\n2:19:29.680 --> 2:19:34.200\n how can we ensure that the beautiful parts of nature\n\n2:19:35.720 --> 2:19:39.600\n remain a big part of our lives as human beings\n\n2:19:39.600 --> 2:19:41.040\n in the way we think about it,\n\n2:19:41.040 --> 2:19:46.040\n in the way we also keep it around, preserve it?\n\n2:19:46.280 --> 2:19:47.960\n You know, we keep it part of our minds\n\n2:19:47.960 --> 2:19:49.080\n and part of our world.\n\n2:19:51.720 --> 2:19:55.120\n It's a very difficult question\n\n2:19:55.120 --> 2:19:58.200\n because every time there was a conflict\n\n2:19:58.200 --> 2:20:02.200\n between conservation of a natural habitat\n\n2:20:02.200 --> 2:20:07.080\n and allowing people to get that little bit of extra food\n\n2:20:07.080 --> 2:20:08.400\n for their babies,\n\n2:20:08.400 --> 2:20:13.080\n then naturally the tendency is for the humans to win.\n\n2:20:13.960 --> 2:20:17.640\n And so we have this steady erosion\n\n2:20:17.640 --> 2:20:22.200\n in the face of tremendous efforts to conserve nature.\n\n2:20:22.200 --> 2:20:25.960\n We have a continuing steady erosion of habitats\n\n2:20:25.960 --> 2:20:27.960\n and all the species,\n\n2:20:27.960 --> 2:20:30.840\n and the numbers are always in the wrong direction.\n\n2:20:31.720 --> 2:20:34.600\n Occasionally you get sort of wonderful little examples\n\n2:20:34.600 --> 2:20:36.480\n of something being saved,\n\n2:20:36.480 --> 2:20:39.320\n but the overall trend is clear.\n\n2:20:40.320 --> 2:20:43.000\n And it's very difficult to see how one can ever escape that\n\n2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:45.200\n because it's not human.\n\n2:20:46.520 --> 2:20:49.400\n Now that we are essentially a single tribe,\n\n2:20:50.280 --> 2:20:55.280\n to want to save an elephant if it means killing 20 humans.\n\n2:20:57.600 --> 2:21:02.200\n So I think the only way in which we can really conserve\n\n2:21:02.200 --> 2:21:06.520\n is if we put tremendous effort\n\n2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:11.520\n into conserving the very best representative areas of nature.\n\n2:21:15.360 --> 2:21:18.840\n Often this will be the national parks that already exist.\n\n2:21:18.840 --> 2:21:22.680\n And what we have to do is to make them so valuable\n\n2:21:22.680 --> 2:21:26.560\n that actually it is worth it in terms of human survival\n\n2:21:26.560 --> 2:21:29.040\n to be able to keep those sorts of places.\n\n2:21:29.040 --> 2:21:32.720\n And that's the attitude that my colleagues and I\n\n2:21:32.720 --> 2:21:33.680\n have taken in Uganda,\n\n2:21:33.680 --> 2:21:38.680\n where we want to keep the Kibale National Park alive,\n\n2:21:39.440 --> 2:21:41.280\n which has got the largest population chimpanzees\n\n2:21:41.280 --> 2:21:42.120\n in Uganda,\n\n2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:44.200\n and it's got elephants and wonderful birds\n\n2:21:44.200 --> 2:21:46.720\n and wonderful butterflies and wonderful plants and so on,\n\n2:21:46.720 --> 2:21:51.160\n and visitors, and lots and lots of visitors.\n\n2:21:51.160 --> 2:21:54.520\n It may be that we're going to have to have huge increases\n\n2:21:54.520 --> 2:21:58.800\n in the amount of charges that you pay for ecotourism.\n\n2:21:58.800 --> 2:22:02.600\n And you need to make sure that ecotourism is done right.\n\n2:22:02.600 --> 2:22:06.480\n In other places, you will keep nature there\n\n2:22:06.480 --> 2:22:11.480\n because it's useful for maintaining the climate,\n\n2:22:12.600 --> 2:22:13.720\n bringing rain.\n\n2:22:15.120 --> 2:22:20.120\n Maybe you can in some places convince people\n\n2:22:20.600 --> 2:22:25.600\n of the sheer sort of aesthetics of keeping nature\n\n2:22:25.600 --> 2:22:28.920\n that even over the long term,\n\n2:22:28.920 --> 2:22:33.920\n presidents whose job it is to look for the future\n\n2:22:34.280 --> 2:22:36.840\n of the country will be persuaded\n\n2:22:36.840 --> 2:22:39.960\n that you can do it for purely aesthetic reasons.\n\n2:22:39.960 --> 2:22:44.960\n But overall, what is required is for people\n\n2:22:47.080 --> 2:22:50.920\n in the rich countries to do much more investment\n\n2:22:50.920 --> 2:22:55.920\n than they have so far in maintaining both the natural places\n\n2:22:56.920 --> 2:23:01.160\n in their own countries and in the tropics.\n\n2:23:01.160 --> 2:23:02.680\n And if you look at Africa,\n\n2:23:02.680 --> 2:23:07.680\n I mean, the population trends are that Nigeria\n\n2:23:08.720 --> 2:23:12.920\n may become the most populous country in the world, I think,\n\n2:23:12.920 --> 2:23:14.320\n or within a century.\n\n2:23:16.160 --> 2:23:19.320\n The future of African habitats,\n\n2:23:19.320 --> 2:23:21.880\n you know, it's clear what's gonna happen in general.\n\n2:23:21.880 --> 2:23:23.920\n There's gonna be a huge conversion\n\n2:23:23.920 --> 2:23:25.360\n towards agricultural land.\n\n2:23:28.040 --> 2:23:32.040\n I heard Ed Wilson speak years ago\n\n2:23:32.040 --> 2:23:36.480\n about the prospect of the entire globe\n\n2:23:36.480 --> 2:23:39.720\n being turned into a single human feedlot.\n\n2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:44.560\n It's gonna take a lot to avoid that.\n\n2:23:44.560 --> 2:23:49.560\n He is out there calling for half the earth\n\n2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:53.040\n to be devoted to nature.\n\n2:23:53.040 --> 2:23:56.360\n It's incredibly ambitious and incredibly optimistic.\n\n2:23:56.360 --> 2:24:00.240\n But unless you have really exciting goals,\n\n2:24:00.240 --> 2:24:01.720\n probably nothing will be achieved.\n\n2:24:02.760 --> 2:24:06.040\n Yeah, I mean, there's something to me,\n\n2:24:06.040 --> 2:24:08.480\n like when I visit New York and I see Central Park\n\n2:24:08.480 --> 2:24:10.560\n and then somehow constructed a situation\n\n2:24:10.560 --> 2:24:14.160\n where you preserve this park in the middle of the park,\n\n2:24:14.160 --> 2:24:17.600\n probably some of the most expensive land in the world.\n\n2:24:17.600 --> 2:24:19.600\n The fact that that's possible gives me hope\n\n2:24:19.600 --> 2:24:22.800\n that you can do this kind of preservation at a global scale,\n\n2:24:23.720 --> 2:24:25.720\n perhaps for just the aesthetic reasons\n\n2:24:25.720 --> 2:24:28.840\n of just valuing the beauty\n\n2:24:28.840 --> 2:24:32.040\n and just respecting our origins\n\n2:24:33.200 --> 2:24:35.200\n of having come from the earth.\n\n2:24:35.200 --> 2:24:39.280\n We are so incredibly lucky to have chimpanzees,\n\n2:24:39.280 --> 2:24:43.240\n bonobos and gorillas as our close relatives\n\n2:24:43.240 --> 2:24:44.480\n still living on the earth.\n\n2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:46.600\n We're unlucky that we don't have Australopithecines\n\n2:24:46.600 --> 2:24:48.080\n and other species of homo,\n\n2:24:48.080 --> 2:24:49.640\n but we're still lucky to have those\n\n2:24:49.640 --> 2:24:51.920\n because they are incredibly closely related to us\n\n2:24:51.920 --> 2:24:54.440\n compared to what most animals have.\n\n2:24:54.440 --> 2:24:56.880\n There are many animals that don't have any close relatives\n\n2:24:56.880 --> 2:24:58.760\n to them on the earth.\n\n2:24:58.760 --> 2:25:01.040\n But not only are they relatively close,\n\n2:25:01.040 --> 2:25:03.520\n but they teach us so much about ourselves.\n\n2:25:04.600 --> 2:25:06.920\n The similarities between them and ourselves\n\n2:25:06.920 --> 2:25:09.480\n raise questions that we can then test\n\n2:25:09.480 --> 2:25:13.880\n about the extent to which our own behavioral propensities\n\n2:25:13.880 --> 2:25:16.760\n are derived from the same evolutionary stock\n\n2:25:16.760 --> 2:25:18.960\n as in those great apes.\n\n2:25:18.960 --> 2:25:21.160\n Well, how much is that worth?\n\n2:25:21.160 --> 2:25:24.600\n I mean, we could spend billions going to the Mars\n\n2:25:24.600 --> 2:25:28.440\n to find evidence of bacteria there,\n\n2:25:28.440 --> 2:25:30.400\n and that's fascinating too.\n\n2:25:30.400 --> 2:25:33.160\n But we should be spending billions on this earth\n\n2:25:33.160 --> 2:25:36.640\n in order to make sure that we have,\n\n2:25:36.640 --> 2:25:40.200\n I don't know how to say it,\n\n2:25:40.200 --> 2:25:43.640\n substantial representative populations\n\n2:25:43.640 --> 2:25:45.440\n of these close relatives.\n\n2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:47.000\n Yeah, that we can meet.\n\n2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:49.400\n There's something like space tourism\n\n2:25:49.400 --> 2:25:53.360\n when you go out into space and you look back down on earth.\n\n2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:56.260\n That's to a lot of people, including myself,\n\n2:25:56.260 --> 2:25:57.260\n is worth a lot.\n\n2:25:58.120 --> 2:25:59.640\n But why is that worth a lot?\n\n2:25:59.640 --> 2:26:04.640\n Is because it's humbling and beautiful\n\n2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:07.800\n in the same way that meeting\n\n2:26:07.800 --> 2:26:12.800\n our close evolutionary relatives is humbling and beautiful.\n\n2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:17.840\n Just to know that this is what we come from.\n\n2:26:17.840 --> 2:26:19.340\n This is who we are.\n\n2:26:19.340 --> 2:26:21.600\n Not just for the understanding or the science of it,\n\n2:26:21.600 --> 2:26:24.940\n but just something about just the beauty of witnessing this.\n\n2:26:26.400 --> 2:26:30.960\n And again, it's both humbling and empowering\n\n2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:34.660\n that this place is fragile and we're damn lucky to be here.\n\n2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:37.720\n Yes, and unfortunately,\n\n2:26:37.720 --> 2:26:40.400\n the problems are incredibly difficult to solve\n\n2:26:40.400 --> 2:26:42.400\n and there is no one solver.\n\n2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:44.680\n It has to happen from a network\n\n2:26:44.680 --> 2:26:47.800\n of potentially cooperating people.\n\n2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:49.800\n But I mean, you're so right about it being daunting\n\n2:26:49.800 --> 2:26:52.420\n to think about what it looks like from space.\n\n2:26:52.420 --> 2:26:56.240\n And I love the view that Herman Muller expressed\n\n2:26:56.240 --> 2:26:59.040\n of being able to go out from space.\n\n2:26:59.040 --> 2:27:01.680\n And he said the whole of life\n\n2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:04.400\n would look like a kind of rust on the planet.\n\n2:27:06.440 --> 2:27:08.480\n Yeah, so the aliens were to visit.\n\n2:27:08.480 --> 2:27:10.280\n I'm not sure they would notice the life.\n\n2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:15.280\n They would probably notice the trees or ocean.\n\n2:27:15.520 --> 2:27:17.520\n It's a kind of rust.\n\n2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:21.480\n But let me ask the big ridiculous philosophical question.\n\n2:27:21.480 --> 2:27:23.760\n What is the meaning of this rust?\n\n2:27:23.760 --> 2:27:26.280\n What do you think is the meaning of life on Earth?\n\n2:27:26.280 --> 2:27:28.980\n What is the meaning of our human intelligent life?\n\n2:27:31.220 --> 2:27:32.140\n Well, I think it's very clear\n\n2:27:32.140 --> 2:27:35.840\n that we have an evolutionary story\n\n2:27:35.840 --> 2:27:40.840\n that is only getting challenged around the edges.\n\n2:27:41.280 --> 2:27:44.800\n We have a very clear understanding of the evolution of life.\n\n2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:48.780\n And the meaning is we are here\n\n2:27:48.780 --> 2:27:57.780\n as a consequence of materialistic processes that began,\n\n2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:03.080\n in our sense, with the establishment of the Earth\n\n2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:04.920\n four and a half billion years ago, whatever it was,\n\n2:28:04.920 --> 2:28:08.880\n and then water and oxygen and so on.\n\n2:28:09.840 --> 2:28:12.840\n And we are the astonishing consequence\n\n2:28:12.840 --> 2:28:17.840\n of the evolution of cells and multicellular organisms.\n\n2:28:18.840 --> 2:28:22.840\n The word random is the wrong word to use\n\n2:28:22.840 --> 2:28:24.840\n unless you understand what it means.\n\n2:28:24.840 --> 2:28:28.840\n You know, it didn't happen by chance,\n\n2:28:28.840 --> 2:28:30.840\n but a lot of random events had to happen\n\n2:28:30.840 --> 2:28:32.840\n to make this possible.\n\n2:28:32.840 --> 2:28:33.840\n And those random events, of course,\n\n2:28:33.840 --> 2:28:37.840\n are the production of appropriate mutations.\n\n2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:43.840\n But the meaning of life is there is no meaning.\n\n2:28:43.840 --> 2:28:48.840\n The really big mystery of life is why is there a universe?\n\n2:28:49.840 --> 2:28:53.840\n And that same why propagates itself through the whole of it,\n\n2:28:53.840 --> 2:28:55.840\n through the whole process of it,\n\n2:28:55.840 --> 2:28:58.840\n for the emergence of planets, the emergence,\n\n2:28:58.840 --> 2:29:02.840\n first of all, of galaxies, of star systems.\n\n2:29:02.840 --> 2:29:09.840\n Of planets, of the proteins required\n\n2:29:09.840 --> 2:29:11.840\n to construct the single cell organisms\n\n2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:14.840\n and the single cell organism becoming complex organisms\n\n2:29:14.840 --> 2:29:19.840\n and some of the clever fish crawling out onto the land\n\n2:29:19.840 --> 2:29:20.840\n and the whole of it.\n\n2:29:20.840 --> 2:29:21.840\n And then there's fire,\n\n2:29:21.840 --> 2:29:25.840\n some clever guy or lady invented fire,\n\n2:29:25.840 --> 2:29:28.840\n and then now here we are.\n\n2:29:28.840 --> 2:29:32.840\n It just does seem, speaking as a human,\n\n2:29:32.840 --> 2:29:35.840\n kind of special that we're able to reflect on the whole thing\n\n2:29:35.840 --> 2:29:36.840\n or the whole...\n\n2:29:36.840 --> 2:29:37.840\n Wonderful story.\n\n2:29:37.840 --> 2:29:40.840\n So much more interesting than the stories produced by religion.\n\n2:29:40.840 --> 2:29:42.840\n Yeah, it is beautiful,\n\n2:29:42.840 --> 2:29:44.840\n but it just seems special that us humans\n\n2:29:44.840 --> 2:29:49.840\n are able to write religions and construct stories\n\n2:29:49.840 --> 2:29:51.840\n and also do science.\n\n2:29:51.840 --> 2:29:56.840\n That seems kind of amazing.\n\n2:29:56.840 --> 2:30:06.840\n It seems like the universe is such that it creates beings like us\n\n2:30:06.840 --> 2:30:10.840\n that are able to investigate it.\n\n2:30:10.840 --> 2:30:14.840\n And that's why there's this longing for why.\n\n2:30:14.840 --> 2:30:20.840\n That's just such a beautiful little pocket of complexity\n\n2:30:20.840 --> 2:30:21.840\n created by the universe.\n\n2:30:21.840 --> 2:30:26.840\n It seems like there should be a why,\n\n2:30:26.840 --> 2:30:28.840\n but maybe there's just an infinite number of universes\n\n2:30:28.840 --> 2:30:33.840\n and this is the one that led to this particular set of humans.\n\n2:30:33.840 --> 2:30:35.840\n Even without an infinite number of universes,\n\n2:30:35.840 --> 2:30:37.840\n I bet there's an infinite number of intelligent beings.\n\n2:30:37.840 --> 2:30:39.840\n Throughout this universe.\n\n2:30:39.840 --> 2:30:41.840\n Yeah, now that we know how many planets\n\n2:30:41.840 --> 2:30:43.840\n have the right sort of conditions,\n\n2:30:43.840 --> 2:30:46.840\n which is what, I can't remember, a lot.\n\n2:30:46.840 --> 2:30:49.840\n It's some significant percentage of all planets.\n\n2:30:49.840 --> 2:30:54.840\n Then there are apparently billions of planets.\n\n2:30:54.840 --> 2:30:59.840\n Things happen so quickly on Earth.\n\n2:30:59.840 --> 2:31:02.840\n Once you've got water, then you've got life.\n\n2:31:02.840 --> 2:31:07.840\n It did not take long for life to evolve\n\n2:31:07.840 --> 2:31:09.840\n in the big scheme of things.\n\n2:31:09.840 --> 2:31:11.840\n And if you think, you look out there,\n\n2:31:11.840 --> 2:31:15.840\n say there's a nearly infinite number of intelligent civilizations,\n\n2:31:15.840 --> 2:31:21.840\n one dimension you can look at is the proclivity to violence they have.\n\n2:31:21.840 --> 2:31:26.840\n It's interesting to think what level of violence is useful\n\n2:31:26.840 --> 2:31:30.840\n for extending the life of a civilization.\n\n2:31:30.840 --> 2:31:33.840\n So we have a particular set of violence in our history.\n\n2:31:33.840 --> 2:31:37.840\n Maybe being too peaceful is a problem in the early days.\n\n2:31:37.840 --> 2:31:41.840\n Maybe being too violent, quite obviously, is a problem.\n\n2:31:41.840 --> 2:31:42.840\n So you look at viruses.\n\n2:31:42.840 --> 2:31:46.840\n What kind of viruses on Earth propagate and succeed?\n\n2:31:46.840 --> 2:31:49.840\n If you're too deadly, that's a big problem.\n\n2:31:49.840 --> 2:31:52.840\n If you're not deadly enough, that's also a problem.\n\n2:31:52.840 --> 2:31:55.840\n So that is a fascinating exploration of...\n\n2:31:55.840 --> 2:31:57.840\n I don't see any evidence.\n\n2:31:57.840 --> 2:31:58.840\n I don't see where you're coming from\n\n2:31:58.840 --> 2:32:01.840\n when you say that being too peaceful is a problem.\n\n2:32:01.840 --> 2:32:05.840\n Well, because, I'll say it this way,\n\n2:32:05.840 --> 2:32:11.840\n death is a way to get rid of suboptimal solutions.\n\n2:32:11.840 --> 2:32:13.840\n So violence...\n\n2:32:13.840 --> 2:32:15.840\n But there's lots of ways to die without violence.\n\n2:32:15.840 --> 2:32:18.840\n Right. To me, death in itself is violence.\n\n2:32:18.840 --> 2:32:21.840\n And you can...\n\n2:32:21.840 --> 2:32:23.840\n I mean, a lot of people that talk about, for example,\n\n2:32:23.840 --> 2:32:26.840\n longevity and disease and all that kind of stuff,\n\n2:32:26.840 --> 2:32:28.840\n they see death as a...\n\n2:32:28.840 --> 2:32:30.840\n This is the way they talk about it.\n\n2:32:30.840 --> 2:32:33.840\n And it's interesting to philosophically think of it that way.\n\n2:32:33.840 --> 2:32:37.840\n Death is like mass murder that's happening.\n\n2:32:37.840 --> 2:32:42.840\n People that try to, from a biological perspective, help extend life,\n\n2:32:42.840 --> 2:32:46.840\n they see that you're helping...\n\n2:32:46.840 --> 2:32:50.840\n The biggest atrocity in the history of human civilization,\n\n2:32:50.840 --> 2:32:52.840\n from their perspective,\n\n2:32:52.840 --> 2:32:58.840\n is not allocating all our resources to solving death.\n\n2:32:58.840 --> 2:33:01.840\n Right. Because death is a kind of violence.\n\n2:33:01.840 --> 2:33:04.840\n It is the kind of murder that we're allowing\n\n2:33:04.840 --> 2:33:06.840\n to be committed on us by nature.\n\n2:33:06.840 --> 2:33:11.840\n And so the flip side of that is death makes way for new life,\n\n2:33:11.840 --> 2:33:14.840\n for new ideas.\n\n2:33:14.840 --> 2:33:18.840\n Yes. But that's got nothing to do with peace versus war.\n\n2:33:18.840 --> 2:33:21.840\n You have animals that are very, very peaceful,\n\n2:33:21.840 --> 2:33:24.840\n but they evolve just in the same way as other animals do.\n\n2:33:24.840 --> 2:33:28.840\n They just don't do it with death caused by violence.\n\n2:33:28.840 --> 2:33:31.840\n And violent death is premature death, surely.\n\n2:33:31.840 --> 2:33:34.840\n I don't mind about people dying.\n\n2:33:34.840 --> 2:33:40.840\n What I mind about is people dying in their youth, middle age.\n\n2:33:40.840 --> 2:33:41.840\n Prematurely.\n\n2:33:41.840 --> 2:33:44.840\n But some people would say all death is premature.\n\n2:33:44.840 --> 2:33:46.840\n It certainly feels that way.\n\n2:33:46.840 --> 2:33:49.840\n It's died too soon.\n\n2:33:49.840 --> 2:33:51.840\n Anyone who's ever died, died too soon.\n\n2:33:51.840 --> 2:33:54.840\n Yeah. Well, I mean, if we can become like sequoias\n\n2:33:54.840 --> 2:33:57.840\n and live for hundreds of years or thousands of years,\n\n2:33:57.840 --> 2:33:59.840\n that would be great.\n\n2:33:59.840 --> 2:34:01.840\n Do you ponder your own mortality?\n\n2:34:01.840 --> 2:34:03.840\n Are you afraid of death?\n\n2:34:03.840 --> 2:34:05.840\n I don't think I'm afraid of it.\n\n2:34:05.840 --> 2:34:09.840\n I'm reconciled to the fact it's going to happen.\n\n2:34:09.840 --> 2:34:13.840\n I just feel frustrated because I enjoy life,\n\n2:34:13.840 --> 2:34:18.840\n and I don't want to leave the party.\n\n2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:22.840\n Yeah. It's kind of a fun party.\n\n2:34:22.840 --> 2:34:24.840\n I don't want to leave the party either.\n\n2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:27.840\n So however we got here, we made one heck of an awesome party.\n\n2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:30.840\n And you're right.\n\n2:34:30.840 --> 2:34:33.840\n Having a party with a little bit less violence in it\n\n2:34:33.840 --> 2:34:35.840\n is an even more fun party.\n\n2:34:35.840 --> 2:34:38.840\n Richard, I'm deeply honored that you spent time with me today.\n\n2:34:38.840 --> 2:34:40.840\n Your work is amazing.\n\n2:34:40.840 --> 2:34:45.840\n It includes some of the deepest thinking about our human history\n\n2:34:45.840 --> 2:34:47.840\n and the nature of human civilization.\n\n2:34:47.840 --> 2:34:50.840\n So again, thank you so much for talking today.\n\n2:34:50.840 --> 2:34:51.840\n It's an honor.\n\n2:34:51.840 --> 2:34:52.840\n Well, thanks for your great questions.\n\n2:34:52.840 --> 2:35:12.840\n It was a fun conversation.\n\n"
