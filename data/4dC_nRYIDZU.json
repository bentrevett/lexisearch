  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:02.600\n The following is a conversation with Sam Harris,\n\n00:02.600 --> 00:03.920\n one of the most influential\n\n00:03.920 --> 00:06.000\n and pioneering thinkers of our time.\n\n00:06.000 --> 00:08.480\n He's the host of the Making Sense podcast\n\n00:08.480 --> 00:10.420\n and the author of many seminal books\n\n00:10.420 --> 00:12.840\n on human nature and the human mind,\n\n00:12.840 --> 00:15.820\n including The End of Faith, The Moral Landscape,\n\n00:15.820 --> 00:18.560\n Lying, Free Will, and Waking Up.\n\n00:18.560 --> 00:21.640\n He also has a meditation app called Waking Up\n\n00:21.640 --> 00:24.760\n that I've been using to guide my own meditation.\n\n00:24.760 --> 00:26.760\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:26.760 --> 00:31.500\n National Instruments, Valcampo, Athletic Greens, and Linode.\n\n00:31.500 --> 00:34.800\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:34.800 --> 00:36.760\n As a side note, let me say that Sam\n\n00:36.760 --> 00:39.160\n has been an inspiration to me\n\n00:39.160 --> 00:41.320\n as he has been for many, many people,\n\n00:41.320 --> 00:44.800\n first from his writing, then his early debates,\n\n00:44.800 --> 00:48.280\n maybe 13, 14 years ago on the subject of faith,\n\n00:48.280 --> 00:51.240\n his conversations with Christopher Hitchens,\n\n00:51.240 --> 00:54.360\n and since 2013, his podcast.\n\n00:54.360 --> 00:56.820\n I didn't always agree with all of his ideas,\n\n00:56.820 --> 00:59.640\n but I was always drawn to the care and depth\n\n00:59.640 --> 01:01.960\n of the way he explored those ideas,\n\n01:01.960 --> 01:05.360\n the calm and clarity amid the storm of difficult,\n\n01:05.360 --> 01:07.600\n at times controversial discourse.\n\n01:07.600 --> 01:10.600\n I really can't express in words how much it meant to me\n\n01:10.600 --> 01:14.080\n that he, Sam Harris, someone who I've listened to\n\n01:14.080 --> 01:15.960\n for many hundreds of hours,\n\n01:15.960 --> 01:18.120\n would write a kind email to me saying\n\n01:18.120 --> 01:21.400\n he enjoyed this podcast and more,\n\n01:21.400 --> 01:23.520\n that he thought I had a unique voice\n\n01:23.520 --> 01:25.880\n that added something to this world.\n\n01:25.880 --> 01:28.560\n Whether it's true or not, it made me feel special\n\n01:28.560 --> 01:31.040\n and truly grateful to be able to do this thing\n\n01:31.040 --> 01:33.640\n and motivated me to work my ass off\n\n01:33.640 --> 01:35.400\n to live up to those words.\n\n01:35.400 --> 01:37.880\n Meeting Sam and getting to talk with him\n\n01:37.880 --> 01:41.660\n was one of the most memorable moments of my life.\n\n01:41.660 --> 01:44.000\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:47.600\n and here is my conversation with Sam Harris.\n\n01:48.700 --> 01:50.160\n I've been enjoying meditating\n\n01:50.160 --> 01:52.680\n with the Waking Up app recently.\n\n01:52.680 --> 01:55.760\n It makes me think about the origins of cognition\n\n01:55.760 --> 01:58.560\n and consciousness, so let me ask,\n\n01:58.560 --> 02:00.960\n where do thoughts come from?\n\n02:00.960 --> 02:04.600\n Well, that's a very difficult question to answer.\n\n02:04.600 --> 02:09.420\n Subjectively, they appear to come from nowhere, right?\n\n02:09.420 --> 02:14.420\n I mean, they come out of some kind of mystery\n\n02:14.680 --> 02:17.040\n that is at our backs subjectively, right?\n\n02:17.040 --> 02:20.560\n So, which is to say that if you pay attention\n\n02:20.560 --> 02:25.280\n to the nature of your mind in this moment,\n\n02:25.280 --> 02:26.960\n you realize that you don't know\n\n02:26.960 --> 02:29.120\n what you're going to think next, right?\n\n02:29.120 --> 02:30.400\n Now, you're expecting to think something\n\n02:30.400 --> 02:33.480\n that seems like you authored it, right?\n\n02:33.480 --> 02:35.840\n You're not, unless you're schizophrenic\n\n02:35.840 --> 02:38.440\n or you have some kind of thought disorder\n\n02:38.440 --> 02:41.900\n where your thoughts seem fundamentally foreign to you,\n\n02:41.900 --> 02:45.400\n they do have a kind of signature of selfhood\n\n02:45.400 --> 02:50.040\n associated with them, and people readily identify with them.\n\n02:50.040 --> 02:51.920\n They feel like what you are.\n\n02:51.920 --> 02:52.960\n I mean, this is the thing,\n\n02:52.960 --> 02:56.080\n this is the spell that gets broken with meditation.\n\n02:56.080 --> 03:00.140\n Our default state is to feel identical\n\n03:00.140 --> 03:02.640\n to the stream of thought, right?\n\n03:02.640 --> 03:06.960\n Which is fairly paradoxical because how could you,\n\n03:06.960 --> 03:11.880\n as a mind, as a self, if there were such a thing as a self,\n\n03:11.880 --> 03:15.940\n how could you be identical to the next piece of language\n\n03:15.940 --> 03:20.940\n or the next image that just springs into conscious view?\n\n03:22.480 --> 03:26.440\n But, and, you know, meditation is ultimately\n\n03:26.440 --> 03:28.960\n about examining that point of view closely enough\n\n03:28.960 --> 03:32.000\n so as to unravel it and feel the freedom\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:34.360\n that's on the other side of that identification.\n\n03:34.360 --> 03:39.360\n But the, subjectively, thoughts simply emerge, right?\n\n03:41.040 --> 03:43.120\n And you don't think them before you think them, right?\n\n03:43.120 --> 03:46.120\n There's this first moment where, you know,\n\n03:46.120 --> 03:48.640\n just anyone listening to us or watching us now\n\n03:48.640 --> 03:50.960\n could perform this experiment for themselves.\n\n03:50.960 --> 03:54.480\n I mean, just imagine something or remember something.\n\n03:54.480 --> 03:56.640\n You know, just pick a memory, any memory, right?\n\n03:56.640 --> 03:58.280\n You've got a storehouse of memory,\n\n03:58.280 --> 04:00.980\n just promote one to consciousness.\n\n04:02.680 --> 04:04.800\n Did you pick that memory?\n\n04:04.800 --> 04:07.640\n I mean, let's say you remembered breakfast yesterday\n\n04:07.640 --> 04:10.080\n or you remembered what you said to your spouse\n\n04:10.080 --> 04:11.120\n before leaving the house,\n\n04:11.120 --> 04:13.880\n or you remembered what you watched on Netflix last night,\n\n04:13.880 --> 04:16.020\n or you remembered something that happened to you\n\n04:16.020 --> 04:18.820\n when you were four years old, whatever it is, right?\n\n04:20.440 --> 04:24.200\n First it wasn't there, and then it appeared.\n\n04:24.200 --> 04:28.500\n And that is not a, well, I'm sure we'll get to the topic\n\n04:28.500 --> 04:30.900\n of free will, ultimately.\n\n04:30.900 --> 04:33.200\n That's not evidence of free will, right?\n\n04:33.200 --> 04:35.440\n Why are you so sure, by the way?\n\n04:35.440 --> 04:36.280\n It's very interesting.\n\n04:36.280 --> 04:38.480\n Well, through no free will of my own, yeah.\n\n04:38.480 --> 04:42.120\n Everything just appears, right?\n\n04:42.120 --> 04:43.640\n What else could it do?\n\n04:43.640 --> 04:45.480\n And so that's the subjective side of it.\n\n04:45.480 --> 04:48.000\n Objectively, you know, we have every reason to believe\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.840\n that many of our thoughts, all of our thoughts\n\n04:50.840 --> 04:55.840\n are at bottom what some part of our brain is doing\n\n04:57.140 --> 04:58.080\n neurophysiologically.\n\n04:58.080 --> 05:00.000\n I mean, these are the products\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.500\n of some kind of neural computation\n\n05:02.500 --> 05:06.860\n and neural representation when we're talking about memories.\n\n05:06.860 --> 05:10.660\n Is it possible to pull at the string of thoughts\n\n05:10.660 --> 05:12.560\n to try to get to its root?\n\n05:14.080 --> 05:17.640\n To try to dig in past the obvious surface,\n\n05:17.640 --> 05:20.680\n subjective experience of like the thoughts pop out\n\n05:20.680 --> 05:21.640\n out of nowhere.\n\n05:21.640 --> 05:24.460\n Is it possible to somehow get closer to the roots\n\n05:24.460 --> 05:28.720\n of where they come out of from the firing of the cells?\n\n05:28.720 --> 05:32.480\n Or is it a useless pursuit to dig into that direction?\n\n05:32.480 --> 05:37.480\n Well, you can get closer to many, many subtle contents\n\n05:38.280 --> 05:39.960\n in consciousness, right?\n\n05:39.960 --> 05:42.000\n So you can notice things more and more clearly\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.360\n and have a landscape of mind open up\n\n05:44.360 --> 05:47.800\n and become more differentiated and more interesting.\n\n05:47.800 --> 05:51.800\n And if you take psychedelics, you know, it opens up wide,\n\n05:51.800 --> 05:53.960\n depending on what you've taken and the dose, you know,\n\n05:53.960 --> 05:57.200\n it opens in directions and to an extent that, you know,\n\n05:57.200 --> 05:59.760\n very few people imagine would be possible,\n\n05:59.760 --> 06:01.960\n but for having had those experiences.\n\n06:01.960 --> 06:06.960\n But this idea of you getting closer to something,\n\n06:07.200 --> 06:09.080\n to the datum of your mind,\n\n06:09.080 --> 06:11.280\n or such as something of interest in there,\n\n06:11.280 --> 06:16.280\n or something that's more real is ultimately undermined\n\n06:16.360 --> 06:17.400\n because there's no place\n\n06:17.400 --> 06:19.560\n from which you're getting closer to it.\n\n06:19.560 --> 06:22.520\n There's no your part of that journey, right?\n\n06:22.520 --> 06:25.440\n Like we tend to start out, you know,\n\n06:25.440 --> 06:29.120\n whether it's in meditation or in any kind\n\n06:29.120 --> 06:33.560\n of self examination or, you know, taking psychedelics,\n\n06:33.560 --> 06:36.000\n we start out with this default point of view\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:41.000\n of feeling like we're the kind of the rider\n\n06:41.400 --> 06:42.600\n on the horse of consciousness,\n\n06:42.600 --> 06:46.640\n or we're the man in the boat going down the stream\n\n06:46.640 --> 06:47.800\n of consciousness, right?\n\n06:47.800 --> 06:49.720\n But we're so we're differentiated\n\n06:49.720 --> 06:54.720\n from what we know cognitively, introspectively,\n\n06:56.140 --> 06:58.120\n but that feeling of being differentiated,\n\n06:58.120 --> 06:59.520\n that feeling of being a self\n\n06:59.520 --> 07:01.680\n that can strategically pay attention\n\n07:01.680 --> 07:03.320\n to some contents of consciousness\n\n07:04.680 --> 07:06.680\n is what it's like to be identified\n\n07:06.680 --> 07:09.460\n with some part of the stream of thought\n\n07:09.460 --> 07:10.880\n that's going uninspected, right?\n\n07:10.880 --> 07:13.560\n Like it's a false point of view.\n\n07:13.560 --> 07:16.740\n And when you see that and cut through that,\n\n07:16.740 --> 07:20.780\n then this sense of this notion of going deeper\n\n07:21.640 --> 07:25.480\n kind of breaks apart because really there is no depth.\n\n07:25.480 --> 07:27.240\n Ultimately, everything is right on the surface.\n\n07:27.240 --> 07:29.020\n Everything, there's no center to consciousness.\n\n07:29.020 --> 07:30.460\n There's just consciousness and its contents.\n\n07:30.460 --> 07:33.160\n And those contents can change vastly.\n\n07:33.160 --> 07:36.740\n Again, if you drop acid, you know, the contents change.\n\n07:37.920 --> 07:42.640\n But there's, in some sense, that doesn't represent\n\n07:43.900 --> 07:46.480\n a position of depth versus, the continuum\n\n07:46.480 --> 07:49.240\n of depth versus surface has broken apart.\n\n07:49.240 --> 07:51.560\n So you're taking as a starting point\n\n07:51.560 --> 07:54.280\n that there is a horse called consciousness\n\n07:54.280 --> 07:55.760\n and you're riding it.\n\n07:55.760 --> 07:57.680\n And the actual riding is very shallow.\n\n07:57.680 --> 07:59.720\n This is all surface.\n\n07:59.720 --> 08:02.520\n So let me ask about that horse.\n\n08:02.520 --> 08:04.160\n What's up with the horse?\n\n08:04.160 --> 08:06.220\n What is consciousness?\n\n08:07.280 --> 08:09.760\n From where does it emerge?\n\n08:09.760 --> 08:13.040\n How like fundamental is it to the physics of reality?\n\n08:13.040 --> 08:16.560\n How fundamental is it to what it means to be human?\n\n08:16.560 --> 08:18.620\n And I'm just asking for a friend\n\n08:18.620 --> 08:20.160\n so that we can build it\n\n08:20.160 --> 08:22.660\n in our artificial intelligence systems.\n\n08:22.660 --> 08:26.620\n Yeah, well, that remains to be seen if we can,\n\n08:26.620 --> 08:30.220\n if we will build it purposefully or just by accident.\n\n08:30.220 --> 08:34.400\n It's a major ethical problem, potentially.\n\n08:35.660 --> 08:39.240\n That, I mean, my concern here is that we may, in fact,\n\n08:40.220 --> 08:44.060\n build artificial intelligence that passes the Turing test,\n\n08:44.060 --> 08:47.100\n which we begin to treat not only as super intelligent\n\n08:47.100 --> 08:50.940\n because it obviously is and demonstrates that,\n\n08:50.940 --> 08:53.200\n but we begin to treat it as conscious\n\n08:53.200 --> 08:54.940\n because it will seem conscious.\n\n08:54.940 --> 08:56.860\n We will have built it to seem conscious.\n\n08:56.860 --> 09:01.420\n And unless we understand exactly how consciousness emerges\n\n09:01.420 --> 09:04.940\n from physics, we won't actually know\n\n09:04.940 --> 09:06.340\n that these systems are conscious, right?\n\n09:06.340 --> 09:08.020\n We'll just, they may say,\n\n09:08.020 --> 09:11.020\n listen, you can't turn me off because that's a murder, right?\n\n09:11.020 --> 09:15.300\n And we will be convinced by that dialogue\n\n09:15.300 --> 09:18.580\n because we will, just in the extreme case,\n\n09:18.580 --> 09:20.820\n who knows when we'll get there.\n\n09:20.820 --> 09:25.820\n But if we build something like perfectly humanoid robots\n\n09:25.940 --> 09:27.580\n that are more intelligent than we are,\n\n09:27.580 --> 09:30.320\n so we're basically in a Westworld like situation,\n\n09:31.260 --> 09:33.180\n there's no way we're going to withhold\n\n09:33.180 --> 09:35.660\n an attribution of consciousness from those machines.\n\n09:35.660 --> 09:36.900\n They're just gonna seem,\n\n09:36.900 --> 09:39.020\n they're just gonna advertise our consciousness\n\n09:39.020 --> 09:41.980\n in every glance and every utterance,\n\n09:42.940 --> 09:44.780\n but we won't know.\n\n09:44.780 --> 09:47.380\n And we won't know in some deeper sense\n\n09:47.380 --> 09:50.540\n than we can be skeptical of the consciousness\n\n09:50.540 --> 09:51.380\n of other people.\n\n09:51.380 --> 09:52.660\n I mean, someone could roll that back and say,\n\n09:52.660 --> 09:54.340\n well, you don't, I don't know that you're conscious\n\n09:54.340 --> 09:55.380\n or you don't know that I'm conscious.\n\n09:55.380 --> 09:57.140\n We're just passing the Turing test for one another,\n\n09:57.140 --> 10:02.140\n but that kind of solipsism isn't justified biologically,\n\n10:02.260 --> 10:06.180\n or we just, anything we understand about the mind\n\n10:06.180 --> 10:08.620\n biologically suggests that you and I\n\n10:08.620 --> 10:12.280\n are part of the same roll of the dice\n\n10:13.180 --> 10:18.060\n in terms of how intelligent and conscious systems emerged\n\n10:18.060 --> 10:21.900\n in the wetware of brains like ours, right?\n\n10:21.900 --> 10:24.220\n So it's not parsimonious for me to think\n\n10:24.220 --> 10:26.120\n that I might be the only conscious person\n\n10:26.120 --> 10:27.820\n or even the only conscious primate.\n\n10:29.340 --> 10:30.620\n I would argue it's not parsimonious\n\n10:30.620 --> 10:33.940\n to withhold consciousness from other apes\n\n10:34.860 --> 10:36.580\n and even other mammals ultimately.\n\n10:36.580 --> 10:38.440\n And once you get beyond the mammals,\n\n10:38.440 --> 10:41.420\n then my intuitions are not really clear.\n\n10:41.420 --> 10:45.020\n The question of how it emerges is genuinely uncertain\n\n10:45.020 --> 10:48.180\n and ultimately the question of whether it emerges\n\n10:48.180 --> 10:49.340\n is still uncertain.\n\n10:49.340 --> 10:54.160\n You can, you know, it's not fashionable to think this,\n\n10:54.160 --> 10:58.240\n but you can certainly argue that consciousness\n\n10:58.240 --> 11:00.920\n might be a fundamental principle of matter\n\n11:00.920 --> 11:04.140\n that doesn't emerge on the basis of information processing,\n\n11:04.140 --> 11:08.680\n even though everything else that we recognize\n\n11:08.680 --> 11:11.460\n about ourselves as minds almost certainly does emerge,\n\n11:11.460 --> 11:13.180\n you know, like an ability to process language,\n\n11:13.180 --> 11:15.780\n that clearly is a matter of information processing\n\n11:15.780 --> 11:18.300\n because you can disrupt that process in ways\n\n11:18.300 --> 11:22.620\n that is just so clear.\n\n11:22.620 --> 11:26.980\n And the problem that the confound with consciousness\n\n11:26.980 --> 11:30.660\n is that, yes, we can seem to interrupt consciousness.\n\n11:30.660 --> 11:33.020\n I mean, you can give someone general anesthesia\n\n11:33.020 --> 11:35.280\n and then you wake them up and you ask them,\n\n11:35.280 --> 11:36.120\n well, what was that like?\n\n11:36.120 --> 11:38.640\n And they say, nothing, I don't remember anything,\n\n11:38.640 --> 11:43.640\n but it's hard to differentiate a mere failure of memory\n\n11:46.220 --> 11:49.100\n from a genuine interruption in consciousness.\n\n11:49.100 --> 11:51.740\n Whereas it's not with, you know, interrupting speech,\n\n11:51.740 --> 11:53.580\n you know, we know when we've done it.\n\n11:53.580 --> 11:57.660\n And it's just obvious that, you know,\n\n11:57.660 --> 11:59.460\n you disrupt the right neural circuits\n\n11:59.460 --> 12:01.880\n and, you know, you've disrupted speech.\n\n12:01.880 --> 12:04.660\n So if you had to bet all your money on one camp or the other,\n\n12:04.660 --> 12:09.020\n would you say, do you err on the side of panpsychism\n\n12:09.020 --> 12:11.900\n where consciousness is really fundamental\n\n12:11.900 --> 12:16.780\n to all of reality or more on the other side,\n\n12:16.780 --> 12:20.220\n which is like, it's a nice little side effect,\n\n12:20.220 --> 12:23.980\n a useful like hack for us humans to survive.\n\n12:23.980 --> 12:26.260\n Where, on that spectrum, where do you land\n\n12:26.260 --> 12:27.900\n when you think about consciousness,\n\n12:27.900 --> 12:30.380\n especially from an engineering perspective?\n\n12:30.380 --> 12:35.140\n I'm truly agnostic on this point, I mean, I think I'm,\n\n12:35.140 --> 12:37.780\n you know, it's kind of in coin toss mode for me.\n\n12:37.780 --> 12:42.780\n I don't know, and panpsychism is not so compelling to me.\n\n12:44.980 --> 12:46.900\n Again, it just seems unfalsifiable.\n\n12:46.900 --> 12:49.020\n I wouldn't know how the universe would be different\n\n12:49.020 --> 12:50.700\n if panpsychism were true.\n\n12:50.700 --> 12:53.260\n It's just to remind people panpsychism is this idea\n\n12:53.260 --> 12:57.260\n that consciousness may be pushed all the way down\n\n12:57.260 --> 12:59.580\n into the most fundamental constituents of matters.\n\n12:59.580 --> 13:01.100\n So there might be something that it's like\n\n13:01.100 --> 13:05.100\n to be an electron or, you know, a cork,\n\n13:05.100 --> 13:08.980\n but then you wouldn't expect anything to be different\n\n13:08.980 --> 13:12.460\n at the macro scale, or at least I wouldn't expect\n\n13:12.460 --> 13:13.660\n anything to be different.\n\n13:14.740 --> 13:16.700\n So it may be unfalsifiable.\n\n13:16.700 --> 13:20.500\n It just might be that reality is not something\n\n13:22.240 --> 13:26.100\n we're as in touch with as we think we are,\n\n13:26.100 --> 13:31.100\n and that at its base layer to kind of break it into mind\n\n13:31.900 --> 13:34.540\n and matter as we've done ontologically\n\n13:35.540 --> 13:37.340\n is to misconstrue it, right?\n\n13:37.340 --> 13:40.940\n I mean, there could be some kind of neutral monism\n\n13:40.940 --> 13:41.940\n at the bottom, and this, you know,\n\n13:41.940 --> 13:43.900\n this idea doesn't originate with me.\n\n13:43.900 --> 13:47.260\n This goes all the way back to Bertrand Russell\n\n13:47.260 --> 13:50.900\n and others, you know, 100 plus years ago,\n\n13:50.900 --> 13:53.980\n but I just feel like the concepts we're using\n\n13:53.980 --> 13:58.980\n to divide consciousness and matter\n\n13:59.060 --> 14:02.300\n may in fact be part of our problem, right?\n\n14:02.300 --> 14:05.980\n Where the rubber hits the road psychologically here\n\n14:05.980 --> 14:08.820\n are things like, well, what is death, right?\n\n14:08.820 --> 14:12.540\n Like do we, any expectation that we survive death\n\n14:12.540 --> 14:14.540\n or any part of us survives death,\n\n14:14.540 --> 14:19.540\n that really seems to be the many people's concern here.\n\n14:20.260 --> 14:23.140\n Well, I tend to believe just as a small little tangent,\n\n14:23.140 --> 14:24.660\n like I'm with Ernest Becker on this,\n\n14:24.660 --> 14:27.700\n that there's some, it's interesting to think\n\n14:27.700 --> 14:29.240\n about death and consciousness,\n\n14:29.240 --> 14:32.420\n which one is the chicken, which one is the egg,\n\n14:32.420 --> 14:34.620\n because it feels like death could be the very thing,\n\n14:34.620 --> 14:36.900\n like our knowledge of mortality could be the very thing\n\n14:36.900 --> 14:38.420\n that creates the consciousness.\n\n14:39.500 --> 14:41.460\n Yeah, well, then you're using consciousness\n\n14:41.460 --> 14:43.700\n differently than I am.\n\n14:43.700 --> 14:47.060\n I mean, so for me, consciousness is just the fact\n\n14:47.060 --> 14:49.980\n that the lights are on at all,\n\n14:49.980 --> 14:53.260\n there's an experiential quality to anything.\n\n14:53.260 --> 14:56.260\n So much of the processing that's happening\n\n14:56.260 --> 15:00.500\n in our brains right now certainly seems to be happening\n\n15:00.500 --> 15:01.900\n in the dark, right?\n\n15:01.900 --> 15:06.220\n Like it's not associated with this qualitative sense\n\n15:06.220 --> 15:08.780\n that there's something that it's like to be that part\n\n15:08.780 --> 15:11.640\n of the mind doing that mental thing.\n\n15:13.520 --> 15:16.940\n But for other parts, the lights are on\n\n15:16.940 --> 15:18.580\n and we can talk about,\n\n15:18.580 --> 15:20.320\n and whether we talk about it or not,\n\n15:20.320 --> 15:25.320\n we can feel directly that there's something\n\n15:25.860 --> 15:27.020\n that it's like to be us.\n\n15:27.020 --> 15:29.740\n There's something, something seems to be happening, right?\n\n15:29.740 --> 15:34.260\n And the seeming in our case is broken into vision\n\n15:34.260 --> 15:36.820\n and hearing and proprioception\n\n15:36.820 --> 15:41.820\n and taste and smell and thought and emotion.\n\n15:42.340 --> 15:45.100\n I mean, there are the contents of consciousness\n\n15:45.100 --> 15:50.100\n that we are familiar with\n\n15:50.460 --> 15:53.260\n and that we can have direct access to\n\n15:53.260 --> 15:56.480\n in any present moment when we're, quote, conscious.\n\n15:57.540 --> 16:00.140\n And even if we're confused about them,\n\n16:00.140 --> 16:02.300\n even if we're asleep and dreaming\n\n16:02.300 --> 16:04.060\n and it's not a lucid dream,\n\n16:04.060 --> 16:07.840\n we're just totally confused about our circumstance,\n\n16:07.840 --> 16:11.420\n what you can't say is that we're confused\n\n16:11.420 --> 16:12.500\n about consciousness.\n\n16:12.500 --> 16:14.660\n Like you can't say that consciousness itself\n\n16:14.660 --> 16:18.900\n might be an illusion because on this account,\n\n16:18.900 --> 16:22.140\n it just means that things seem any way at all.\n\n16:22.140 --> 16:23.340\n I mean, even like if this,\n\n16:23.340 --> 16:26.420\n it seems to me that I'm seeing a cup on the table.\n\n16:26.420 --> 16:27.540\n Now I could be wrong about that.\n\n16:27.540 --> 16:28.500\n It could be a hologram.\n\n16:28.500 --> 16:29.780\n I could be asleep and dreaming.\n\n16:29.780 --> 16:31.540\n I could be hallucinating,\n\n16:31.540 --> 16:35.140\n but the seeming part isn't really up for grabs\n\n16:35.140 --> 16:37.620\n in terms of being an illusion.\n\n16:37.620 --> 16:41.660\n It's not, something seems to be happening.\n\n16:41.660 --> 16:45.740\n And that seeming is the context in which\n\n16:45.740 --> 16:50.020\n every other thing we can notice about ourselves\n\n16:50.020 --> 16:50.860\n can be noticed.\n\n16:50.860 --> 16:53.540\n And it's also the context in which certain illusions\n\n16:53.540 --> 16:55.460\n can be cut through because we're not,\n\n16:55.460 --> 16:57.860\n we can be wrong about what it's like to be us.\n\n16:57.860 --> 17:01.980\n And we can, I'm not saying we're incorrigible\n\n17:01.980 --> 17:04.460\n with respect to our claims\n\n17:04.460 --> 17:05.700\n about the nature of our experience,\n\n17:05.700 --> 17:10.140\n but for instance, many people feel like they have a self\n\n17:10.140 --> 17:11.860\n and they feel like it has free will.\n\n17:11.860 --> 17:14.340\n And I'm quite sure at this point\n\n17:14.340 --> 17:15.260\n that they're wrong about that,\n\n17:15.260 --> 17:19.900\n and that you can cut through those experiences\n\n17:19.900 --> 17:22.140\n and then things seem a different way, right?\n\n17:22.140 --> 17:25.020\n So it's not that things don't,\n\n17:25.020 --> 17:26.500\n there aren't discoveries to be made there\n\n17:26.500 --> 17:28.220\n and assumptions to be overturned,\n\n17:28.220 --> 17:33.220\n but this kind of consciousness is something\n\n17:33.980 --> 17:38.220\n that I would think, it doesn't just come online\n\n17:38.220 --> 17:39.700\n when we get language.\n\n17:39.700 --> 17:42.500\n It doesn't just come online when we form a concept of death\n\n17:42.500 --> 17:45.260\n or the finiteness of life.\n\n17:45.260 --> 17:48.220\n It doesn't require a sense of self, right?\n\n17:48.220 --> 17:50.420\n So it doesn't, it's prior\n\n17:50.420 --> 17:52.500\n to a differentiating self and other.\n\n17:54.140 --> 17:58.860\n And I wouldn't even think it's necessarily limited to people.\n\n17:58.860 --> 18:03.860\n I do think probably any mammal has this,\n\n18:04.140 --> 18:07.500\n but certainly if you're going to presuppose\n\n18:07.500 --> 18:11.980\n that something about our brains is producing this, right?\n\n18:11.980 --> 18:15.580\n And that's a very safe assumption,\n\n18:15.580 --> 18:18.300\n even though we can't,\n\n18:18.300 --> 18:20.620\n even though you can argue the jury's still out\n\n18:20.620 --> 18:22.180\n to some degree,\n\n18:22.180 --> 18:24.740\n then it's very hard to draw a principled line\n\n18:24.740 --> 18:26.620\n between us and chimps,\n\n18:26.620 --> 18:30.140\n or chimps and rats even in the end,\n\n18:30.140 --> 18:33.140\n given the underlying neural similarities.\n\n18:33.140 --> 18:35.980\n So, and I don't know phylogenetically,\n\n18:35.980 --> 18:38.620\n I don't know how far back to push that.\n\n18:38.620 --> 18:41.700\n There are people who think single cells might be conscious\n\n18:41.700 --> 18:43.460\n or that flies are certainly conscious.\n\n18:43.460 --> 18:47.940\n They've got something like 100,000 neurons in their brains.\n\n18:47.940 --> 18:52.940\n I mean, there's a lot going on even in a fly, right?\n\n18:53.180 --> 18:55.500\n But I don't have intuitions about that.\n\n18:55.500 --> 18:58.260\n But it's not in your sense an illusion you can cut through.\n\n18:58.260 --> 19:00.100\n I mean, to push back,\n\n19:00.100 --> 19:03.140\n the alternative version could be it is an illusion\n\n19:03.140 --> 19:06.580\n constructed by, just by humans.\n\n19:06.580 --> 19:08.140\n I'm not sure I believe this,\n\n19:08.140 --> 19:10.160\n but in part of me hopes this is true\n\n19:10.160 --> 19:12.540\n because it makes it easier to engineer,\n\n19:12.540 --> 19:16.460\n is that humans are able to contemplate their mortality\n\n19:17.420 --> 19:21.460\n and that contemplation in itself creates consciousness.\n\n19:21.460 --> 19:24.200\n That like the rich lights on experience.\n\n19:24.200 --> 19:26.380\n So the lights don't actually even turn on\n\n19:26.380 --> 19:29.660\n in the way that you're describing until after birth\n\n19:30.740 --> 19:31.900\n in that construction.\n\n19:31.900 --> 19:34.980\n So do you think it's possible that that is the case?\n\n19:34.980 --> 19:39.320\n That it is a sort of construct of the way we deal,\n\n19:39.320 --> 19:42.860\n almost like a social tool to deal with the reality\n\n19:42.860 --> 19:45.620\n of the world, the social interaction with other humans?\n\n19:46.580 --> 19:49.020\n Or is, because you're saying the complete opposite,\n\n19:49.020 --> 19:53.140\n which is it's like fundamental to single cell organisms\n\n19:53.140 --> 19:54.900\n and trees and so on.\n\n19:54.900 --> 19:57.840\n Right, well, yeah, so I don't know how far down to push it.\n\n19:57.840 --> 20:00.540\n I don't have intuitions that single cells\n\n20:00.540 --> 20:01.660\n are likely to be conscious,\n\n20:01.660 --> 20:06.660\n but they might be, and again, it could be unfalsifiable.\n\n20:08.180 --> 20:10.480\n But as far as babies not being conscious,\n\n20:10.480 --> 20:12.040\n or you don't become conscious\n\n20:12.040 --> 20:14.500\n until you can recognize yourself in a mirror\n\n20:14.500 --> 20:17.280\n or you have a conversation or treat other people.\n\n20:17.280 --> 20:19.740\n First of all, babies treat other people as others\n\n20:20.660 --> 20:25.660\n far earlier than we have traditionally given them credit for.\n\n20:25.780 --> 20:29.120\n And they certainly do it before they have language, right?\n\n20:29.120 --> 20:33.940\n So it's got to proceed language to some degree.\n\n20:33.940 --> 20:36.760\n And I mean, you can interrogate this for yourself\n\n20:36.760 --> 20:40.340\n because you can put yourself in various states\n\n20:40.340 --> 20:44.780\n that are rather obviously not linguistic.\n\n20:46.340 --> 20:48.780\n Meditation allows you to do this.\n\n20:48.780 --> 20:50.520\n You can certainly do it with psychedelics\n\n20:50.520 --> 20:54.140\n where it's just your capacity for language\n\n20:54.140 --> 20:58.820\n has been obliterated and yet you're all too conscious.\n\n20:58.820 --> 21:03.820\n In fact, I think you could make a stronger argument\n\n21:05.660 --> 21:09.580\n for things running the other way,\n\n21:09.580 --> 21:14.480\n that there's something about language and conceptual thought\n\n21:14.480 --> 21:18.160\n that is eliminative of conscious experience,\n\n21:18.160 --> 21:23.160\n that we're potentially much more conscious of data,\n\n21:23.840 --> 21:26.860\n sense data and everything else than we tend to be,\n\n21:26.860 --> 21:29.220\n and we have trimmed it down\n\n21:29.220 --> 21:33.640\n based on how we have acquired concepts.\n\n21:33.640 --> 21:36.780\n And so like, when I walk into a room like this,\n\n21:36.780 --> 21:38.780\n I know I'm walking into a room,\n\n21:38.780 --> 21:41.980\n I have certain expectations of what is in a room.\n\n21:41.980 --> 21:45.560\n I would be very surprised to see wild animals in here\n\n21:45.560 --> 21:50.560\n or a waterfall or there are things I'm not expecting,\n\n21:51.020 --> 21:53.580\n but I can know I'm not expecting them\n\n21:53.580 --> 21:54.860\n or I'm expecting their absence\n\n21:54.860 --> 21:57.380\n because of my capacity to be surprised\n\n21:57.380 --> 22:01.800\n once I walk into a room and I see a live gorilla or whatever.\n\n22:01.800 --> 22:05.900\n So there's structure there that we have put in place\n\n22:05.900 --> 22:08.940\n based on all of our conceptual learning\n\n22:08.940 --> 22:11.420\n and language learning.\n\n22:11.420 --> 22:15.060\n And it causes us not to,\n\n22:15.060 --> 22:17.380\n and one of the things that happens when you take psychedelics\n\n22:17.380 --> 22:21.740\n and you just look as though for the first time at anything,\n\n22:21.740 --> 22:26.740\n it becomes incredibly overloaded with,\n\n22:27.120 --> 22:28.580\n it can become overloaded with meaning\n\n22:28.580 --> 22:33.580\n and just the torrents of sense data that are coming in\n\n22:37.220 --> 22:39.120\n in even the most ordinary circumstances\n\n22:39.120 --> 22:40.780\n can become overwhelming for people.\n\n22:40.780 --> 22:45.620\n And that tends to just obliterate one's capacity\n\n22:45.620 --> 22:47.820\n to capture any of it linguistically.\n\n22:47.820 --> 22:49.460\n And as you're coming down, right?\n\n22:49.460 --> 22:50.540\n Have you done psychedelics?\n\n22:50.540 --> 22:52.220\n Have you ever done acid or?\n\n22:52.220 --> 22:55.680\n Not acid, mushroom, and that's it.\n\n22:55.680 --> 22:58.500\n And also edibles,\n\n22:58.500 --> 23:01.180\n but there's some psychedelic properties to them.\n\n23:01.180 --> 23:04.900\n But yeah, mushrooms several times\n\n23:04.900 --> 23:06.860\n and always had an incredible experience.\n\n23:06.860 --> 23:09.420\n Exactly the kind of experience you're referring to,\n\n23:09.420 --> 23:14.180\n which is if it's true that language constrains\n\n23:14.180 --> 23:15.380\n our experience,\n\n23:15.380 --> 23:19.600\n it felt like I was removing some of the constraints.\n\n23:19.600 --> 23:21.540\n Because even just the most basic things\n\n23:21.540 --> 23:22.720\n were beautiful in the way\n\n23:22.720 --> 23:25.260\n that I wasn't able to appreciate previously,\n\n23:25.260 --> 23:27.420\n like trees and nature and so on.\n\n23:27.420 --> 23:30.660\n Yeah, and the experience of coming down\n\n23:31.620 --> 23:36.620\n is an experience of encountering the futility\n\n23:37.600 --> 23:42.600\n of capturing what you just saw a moment ago in words.\n\n23:44.020 --> 23:47.700\n Especially if you have any part of your self concept\n\n23:47.700 --> 23:50.740\n and your ego program is to be able\n\n23:50.740 --> 23:51.980\n to capture things in words.\n\n23:51.980 --> 23:55.660\n And if you're a writer or a poet or a scientist\n\n23:55.660 --> 23:58.540\n or someone who wants to just encapsulate\n\n23:58.540 --> 24:01.020\n the profundity of what just happened,\n\n24:01.900 --> 24:06.900\n the total fatuousness of that enterprise\n\n24:08.780 --> 24:12.660\n when you have taken a whopping dose of psychedelics\n\n24:12.660 --> 24:17.660\n and you begin to even gesture at describing it to yourself,\n\n24:19.700 --> 24:22.500\n so that you could describe it to others.\n\n24:22.500 --> 24:26.500\n It's just, it's like trying to thread a needle\n\n24:26.500 --> 24:27.540\n using your elbows.\n\n24:27.540 --> 24:30.180\n I mean, it's like you're trying something that can't,\n\n24:30.180 --> 24:34.780\n it's like the mere gesture proves it's impossibility.\n\n24:34.780 --> 24:39.780\n And it's, so yeah, for me that suggests just empirically\n\n24:39.780 --> 24:41.700\n on the first person side that it's possible\n\n24:41.700 --> 24:43.340\n to put yourself in a condition\n\n24:43.340 --> 24:47.460\n where it's clearly not about language\n\n24:47.460 --> 24:49.820\n structuring your experience\n\n24:49.820 --> 24:53.980\n and you're having much more experience than you tend to.\n\n24:53.980 --> 24:57.780\n So the primacy of, language is primary for some things,\n\n24:57.780 --> 25:02.780\n but it's certainly primary for certain kinds of concepts\n\n25:04.780 --> 25:07.580\n and certain kinds of semantic understanding\n\n25:07.580 --> 25:11.180\n and certain kinds of semantic understandings of the world.\n\n25:11.180 --> 25:16.180\n But it's clearly more to mine than the conversation\n\n25:17.700 --> 25:21.420\n we're having with ourselves or that we can have with others.\n\n25:21.420 --> 25:25.900\n Can we go to that world of psychedelics for a bit?\n\n25:25.900 --> 25:27.220\n Sure.\n\n25:27.220 --> 25:30.500\n What do you think, so Joe Rogan apparently\n\n25:30.500 --> 25:37.500\n and many others meet apparently elves on DMT, a lot of people\n\n25:38.900 --> 25:41.540\n report this kind of creatures that they see.\n\n25:41.540 --> 25:43.580\n And again, it's probably the failure of language\n\n25:43.580 --> 25:46.860\n to describe that experience, but DMT is an interesting one.\n\n25:46.860 --> 25:50.180\n There's, as you're aware, there's a bunch of studies\n\n25:50.180 --> 25:54.180\n going on in psychedelics, currently MDMA, psilocybin\n\n25:54.180 --> 25:59.180\n and John Hopkins and much other places, but DMT,\n\n26:03.180 --> 26:08.180\n they all speak of as like some extra super level\n\n26:08.780 --> 26:09.740\n of a psychedelic.\n\n26:09.740 --> 26:13.100\n Yeah, do you have a sense of where it is our mind goes\n\n26:16.940 --> 26:20.100\n on psychedelics, but in DMT especially?\n\n26:20.100 --> 26:22.580\n Well, unfortunately I haven't taken DMT.\n\n26:22.580 --> 26:23.900\n Unfortunately or fortunately?\n\n26:23.900 --> 26:24.860\n Unfortunately.\n\n26:24.860 --> 26:26.300\n Unfortunately.\n\n26:26.300 --> 26:28.140\n Although it's, I presume it's in my body\n\n26:28.140 --> 26:33.140\n as it is in everyone's brain and many, many plants\n\n26:33.260 --> 26:36.860\n apparently, but I've wanted to take it.\n\n26:36.860 --> 26:39.140\n I haven't been, I had an opportunity that was presented\n\n26:39.140 --> 26:41.380\n itself that where it was obviously the right thing\n\n26:41.380 --> 26:45.740\n for me to be doing, but for those who don't know,\n\n26:45.740 --> 26:49.500\n DMT is often touted as the most intense psychedelic\n\n26:49.500 --> 26:51.420\n and also the shortest acting.\n\n26:51.420 --> 26:54.140\n I mean, you smoke it and it's basically a 10 minute\n\n26:54.140 --> 26:57.820\n experience or a three minute experience within like\n\n26:57.820 --> 27:02.300\n a 10 minute window that when you're really down\n\n27:02.300 --> 27:07.300\n after 10 minutes or so, and Terrence McKenna\n\n27:07.620 --> 27:09.460\n was a big proponent of DMT.\n\n27:09.460 --> 27:12.260\n That was his, the center of the bullseye for him\n\n27:12.260 --> 27:13.660\n psychedelically, apparently.\n\n27:15.500 --> 27:20.060\n And it does, it is characterized, it seems for many people\n\n27:20.060 --> 27:23.020\n by this phenomenon, which is unlike virtually\n\n27:23.020 --> 27:25.900\n any other psychedelic experience, which is your,\n\n27:25.900 --> 27:30.740\n it's not just your perception being broadened or changed.\n\n27:30.740 --> 27:35.740\n It's you according to Terrence McKenna feeling fairly\n\n27:36.380 --> 27:41.020\n unchanged, but catapulted into a different circumstance.\n\n27:41.020 --> 27:45.580\n You and me have been shot elsewhere and find yourself\n\n27:45.580 --> 27:49.020\n in relationship to other entities of some kind, right?\n\n27:49.020 --> 27:52.060\n So the place is populated with things that seem\n\n27:52.060 --> 27:54.140\n not to be your mind.\n\n27:54.140 --> 27:56.260\n So it does feel like travel to another place\n\n27:56.260 --> 27:58.180\n because you're unchanged yourself.\n\n27:58.180 --> 28:00.460\n According, again, I just have this on the authority\n\n28:00.460 --> 28:03.260\n of the people who have described their experience,\n\n28:03.260 --> 28:05.580\n but it sounds like it's pretty common.\n\n28:05.580 --> 28:07.060\n It sounds like it's pretty common for people\n\n28:07.060 --> 28:09.860\n not to have the full experience because it's apparently\n\n28:09.860 --> 28:11.620\n pretty unpleasant to smoke.\n\n28:11.620 --> 28:15.220\n So it's like getting enough on board in order to get shot\n\n28:15.220 --> 28:19.380\n out of the cannon and land among the,\n\n28:20.740 --> 28:25.420\n what McKenna called self transforming machine elves\n\n28:27.500 --> 28:30.780\n that appeared to him like jeweled Faberge egg,\n\n28:30.780 --> 28:34.580\n like self drippling basketballs that were handing him\n\n28:35.620 --> 28:39.500\n completely uninterpretable reams of profound knowledge.\n\n28:41.340 --> 28:44.540\n It's an experience I haven't had.\n\n28:44.540 --> 28:47.700\n So I just have to accept that people have had it.\n\n28:49.380 --> 28:53.860\n I would just point out that our minds are clearly capable\n\n28:53.860 --> 28:58.860\n of producing apparent others on demand\n\n28:59.060 --> 29:01.940\n that are totally compelling to us, right?\n\n29:01.940 --> 29:04.820\n There's no limit to our ability to do that\n\n29:04.820 --> 29:08.260\n as anyone who's ever remembered a dream can attest.\n\n29:08.260 --> 29:10.300\n Every night we go to sleep,\n\n29:10.300 --> 29:11.900\n some of us don't remember dreams very often,\n\n29:11.900 --> 29:15.660\n but some dream vividly every night.\n\n29:15.660 --> 29:20.660\n And just think of how insane that experience is.\n\n29:20.860 --> 29:23.900\n I mean, you've forgotten where you were, right?\n\n29:23.900 --> 29:25.500\n That's the strangest part.\n\n29:25.500 --> 29:27.940\n I mean, this is psychosis, right?\n\n29:27.940 --> 29:29.500\n You have lost your mind.\n\n29:29.500 --> 29:34.500\n You have lost your connection to your episodic memory\n\n29:34.900 --> 29:39.900\n or even your expectations that reality won't undergo\n\n29:39.900 --> 29:42.300\n wholesale changes a moment\n\n29:42.300 --> 29:44.900\n after you have closed your eyes, right?\n\n29:44.900 --> 29:49.140\n Like you're in bed, you're watching something on Netflix,\n\n29:49.140 --> 29:50.420\n you're waiting to fall asleep,\n\n29:50.420 --> 29:54.620\n and then the next thing that happens to you is impossible\n\n29:54.620 --> 29:56.260\n and you're not surprised, right?\n\n29:56.260 --> 29:57.540\n You're talking to dead people,\n\n29:57.540 --> 29:58.920\n you're hanging out with famous people,\n\n29:58.920 --> 30:02.860\n you're someplace you couldn't physically be,\n\n30:02.860 --> 30:05.660\n you can fly and even that's not surprising, right?\n\n30:05.660 --> 30:08.960\n So you've lost your mind,\n\n30:08.960 --> 30:10.820\n but relevantly for this.\n\n30:10.820 --> 30:12.220\n Or found it.\n\n30:12.220 --> 30:13.060\n You found something.\n\n30:13.060 --> 30:14.820\n I mean, lucid dreaming is very interesting\n\n30:14.820 --> 30:17.940\n because then you can have the best of both circumstances\n\n30:17.940 --> 30:22.940\n and then it can become systematically explored.\n\n30:22.940 --> 30:25.420\n But what I mean by found, just to start to interrupt,\n\n30:25.420 --> 30:29.060\n is like if we take this brilliant idea\n\n30:29.060 --> 30:32.020\n that language constrains us, grounds us,\n\n30:32.020 --> 30:35.620\n language and other things of the waking world ground us,\n\n30:35.620 --> 30:39.780\n maybe it is that you've found the full capacity\n\n30:41.580 --> 30:44.780\n of your cognition when you dream or when you do psychedelics.\n\n30:44.780 --> 30:47.780\n You're stepping outside the little human cage,\n\n30:47.780 --> 30:51.220\n the cage of the human condition to open the door\n\n30:51.220 --> 30:54.260\n and step out and look around and then go back in.\n\n30:54.260 --> 30:57.140\n Well, you've definitely stepped out of something\n\n30:57.140 --> 30:59.260\n and into something else, but you've also lost something,\n\n30:59.260 --> 31:01.180\n right, you've lost certain capacities.\n\n31:01.180 --> 31:02.100\n Memory?\n\n31:02.100 --> 31:04.140\n Well, just, yeah, in this case,\n\n31:04.140 --> 31:08.020\n you literally didn't, you don't have enough presence of mind\n\n31:08.020 --> 31:11.660\n in the dream state or even in the psychedelic state\n\n31:11.660 --> 31:12.700\n if you take enough.\n\n31:14.900 --> 31:15.740\n To do math.\n\n31:15.740 --> 31:17.140\n There's no psychological,\n\n31:17.140 --> 31:21.760\n there's very little psychological continuity with your life\n\n31:21.760 --> 31:26.400\n such that you're not surprised to be in the presence\n\n31:26.400 --> 31:30.180\n of someone who should be, you should know is dead\n\n31:30.180 --> 31:32.620\n or you should know you're not likely to have met\n\n31:32.620 --> 31:35.540\n by normal channels, right, you're now talking\n\n31:35.540 --> 31:38.940\n to some celebrity and it turns out you're best friends,\n\n31:38.940 --> 31:40.780\n right, and you're not even, you have no memory\n\n31:40.780 --> 31:41.980\n of how you got there, you're like,\n\n31:41.980 --> 31:42.940\n how did you get into the room?\n\n31:42.940 --> 31:45.300\n You're like, did you drive to this restaurant?\n\n31:45.300 --> 31:47.500\n You have no memory and none of that's surprising to you.\n\n31:47.500 --> 31:49.740\n So you're kind of brain damaged in a way,\n\n31:49.740 --> 31:53.440\n you're not reality testing in the normal way.\n\n31:53.440 --> 31:56.420\n The fascinating possibility is that there's probably\n\n31:56.420 --> 31:58.940\n thousands of people who've taken psychedelics\n\n31:58.940 --> 32:03.580\n of various forms and have met Sam Harris on that journey.\n\n32:03.580 --> 32:05.380\n Well, I would put it more likely in dreams,\n\n32:05.380 --> 32:08.020\n not, you know, because with psychedelics,\n\n32:08.020 --> 32:11.500\n you don't tend to hallucinate in a dreamlike way.\n\n32:11.500 --> 32:15.580\n I mean, so DMT is giving you an experience of others,\n\n32:15.580 --> 32:19.340\n but it seems to be nonstandard.\n\n32:19.340 --> 32:23.000\n It's not like, it's not just like dream hallucinations,\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:26.520\n but to the point of coming back to DMT,\n\n32:26.520 --> 32:30.200\n the people want to suggest,\n\n32:30.200 --> 32:32.280\n and Terrence McKenna certainly did suggest\n\n32:32.280 --> 32:37.020\n that because these others are so obviously other\n\n32:37.020 --> 32:39.760\n and they're so vivid, well, then they could not possibly\n\n32:39.760 --> 32:42.840\n be the creation of my own mind,\n\n32:42.840 --> 32:47.840\n but every night in dreams, you create a compelling\n\n32:47.840 --> 32:49.780\n or what is to you at the time,\n\n32:49.780 --> 32:54.000\n a totally compelling simulacrum of another person, right?\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:59.000\n And that just proves the mind is capable of doing it.\n\n33:00.960 --> 33:04.680\n Now, the phenomenon of lucid dreaming shows\n\n33:04.680 --> 33:07.500\n that the mind isn't capable of doing everything you think\n\n33:07.500 --> 33:10.040\n it might be capable of even in that space.\n\n33:10.040 --> 33:14.280\n So one of the things that people have discovered\n\n33:14.280 --> 33:17.480\n in lucid dreams, and I haven't done a lot of lucid dreaming,\n\n33:17.480 --> 33:24.480\n so I can't confirm all of this, I can confirm some of it.\n\n33:24.480 --> 33:28.200\n Apparently in every house, in every room\n\n33:28.200 --> 33:30.400\n in the mansion of dreams,\n\n33:30.400 --> 33:32.840\n all light switches are dimmer switches.\n\n33:32.840 --> 33:36.040\n Like if you go into a dark room and flip on the light,\n\n33:36.040 --> 33:38.000\n it gradually comes up.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:41.400\n It doesn't come up instantly on demand\n\n33:41.400 --> 33:44.660\n because apparently this is covering for the brain's\n\n33:44.660 --> 33:49.480\n inability to produce from a standing start\n\n33:49.480 --> 33:52.160\n visually rich imagery on demand.\n\n33:52.160 --> 33:54.640\n So I haven't confirmed that, but that was,\n\n33:54.640 --> 33:57.960\n people have done research on lucid dreaming claim\n\n33:57.960 --> 33:59.820\n that it's all dimmer switches.\n\n34:01.360 --> 34:03.040\n But one thing I have noticed,\n\n34:03.040 --> 34:08.040\n and people can check this out, is that in a dream,\n\n34:08.520 --> 34:13.520\n if you look at text, a page of text or a sign\n\n34:13.520 --> 34:16.280\n or a television that has text on it,\n\n34:16.280 --> 34:18.800\n and then you turn away and you look back at that text,\n\n34:18.800 --> 34:21.600\n the text will have changed, right?\n\n34:21.600 --> 34:24.440\n The total is it's just a chronic instability,\n\n34:24.440 --> 34:28.900\n graphical instability of text in the dream state.\n\n34:28.900 --> 34:31.120\n And I don't know if that, maybe that's,\n\n34:31.120 --> 34:33.200\n someone can confirm that that's not true for them,\n\n34:33.200 --> 34:34.960\n but whenever I've checked that out,\n\n34:34.960 --> 34:35.800\n that has been true for me.\n\n34:35.800 --> 34:39.040\n So it keeps generating it like real time\n\n34:39.040 --> 34:40.640\n from a video game perspective.\n\n34:40.640 --> 34:44.760\n Yeah, it's rendering, it's re rendering it for some reason.\n\n34:44.760 --> 34:46.000\n What's interesting, I actually,\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:49.180\n I don't know how I found myself in this sets\n\n34:49.180 --> 34:51.800\n of that part of the internet,\n\n34:51.800 --> 34:53.780\n but there's quite a lot of discussion\n\n34:53.780 --> 34:56.400\n about what it's like to do math on LSD.\n\n34:57.360 --> 35:02.360\n Because apparently one of the deepest thinking processes\n\n35:02.360 --> 35:04.700\n needed is those of mathematicians\n\n35:04.700 --> 35:06.040\n or theoretical computer scientists\n\n35:06.040 --> 35:08.480\n are basically doing anything that involves math\n\n35:08.480 --> 35:11.180\n as proofs, and you have to think creatively,\n\n35:11.180 --> 35:13.200\n but also deeply, and you have to think\n\n35:13.200 --> 35:15.880\n for many hours at a time.\n\n35:15.880 --> 35:18.560\n And so they're always looking for ways to like,\n\n35:18.560 --> 35:22.280\n is there any sparks of creativity that could be injected?\n\n35:22.280 --> 35:25.600\n And apparently out of all the psychedelics,\n\n35:25.600 --> 35:29.320\n the worst is LSD because it completely destroys\n\n35:29.320 --> 35:31.040\n your ability to do math well.\n\n35:31.040 --> 35:33.680\n And I wonder whether that has to do with your ability\n\n35:33.680 --> 35:38.460\n to visualize geometric things in a stable way\n\n35:38.460 --> 35:40.120\n in your mind and hold them there\n\n35:40.120 --> 35:41.640\n and stitch things together,\n\n35:41.640 --> 35:44.100\n which is often what's required for proofs.\n\n35:44.100 --> 35:47.980\n But again, it's difficult to kind of research\n\n35:47.980 --> 35:51.000\n these kinds of concepts, but it does make me wonder\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:56.000\n where, what are the spaces, how's the space of things\n\n35:56.400 --> 35:59.120\n you're able to think about and explore\n\n35:59.120 --> 36:02.840\n morphed by different psychedelics\n\n36:02.840 --> 36:06.120\n or dream states and so on, and how's that different?\n\n36:06.120 --> 36:08.040\n How much does it overlap with reality?\n\n36:08.040 --> 36:10.400\n And what is reality?\n\n36:10.400 --> 36:12.320\n Is there a waking state reality?\n\n36:13.360 --> 36:15.920\n Or is it just a tiny subset of reality\n\n36:15.920 --> 36:18.940\n and we get to take a step in other versions of it?\n\n36:18.940 --> 36:23.000\n We tend to think very much in a space time,\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.680\n four dimensional, there's a three dimensional world,\n\n36:25.680 --> 36:29.640\n there's time, and that's what we think about reality.\n\n36:29.640 --> 36:33.640\n And we think of traveling as walking from point A\n\n36:33.640 --> 36:36.740\n to point B in the three dimensional world.\n\n36:36.740 --> 36:40.120\n But that's a very kind of human surviving,\n\n36:40.120 --> 36:43.400\n trying not to get eaten by a lion conception of reality.\n\n36:43.400 --> 36:46.840\n What if traveling is something like we do with psychedelics\n\n36:46.840 --> 36:48.360\n and meet the elves?\n\n36:48.360 --> 36:50.600\n What if it's something, what if thinking\n\n36:50.600 --> 36:53.820\n or the space of ideas as we kind of grow\n\n36:53.820 --> 36:56.440\n and think through ideas, that's traveling?\n\n36:57.740 --> 37:00.380\n Or what if memories is traveling?\n\n37:00.380 --> 37:03.980\n I don't know if you have a favorite view of reality\n\n37:03.980 --> 37:06.980\n or if you had, by the way, I should say,\n\n37:06.980 --> 37:09.380\n excellent conversation with Donald Hoffman.\n\n37:10.420 --> 37:11.980\n Yeah, yeah, he's interesting.\n\n37:11.980 --> 37:15.980\n Is there any inkling of his sense in your mind\n\n37:15.980 --> 37:20.220\n that reality is very far from,\n\n37:20.220 --> 37:22.300\n actual like objective reality is very far\n\n37:22.300 --> 37:24.980\n from the kind of reality we imagine,\n\n37:24.980 --> 37:29.440\n we perceive and we play with in our human minds?\n\n37:29.440 --> 37:31.520\n Well, the first thing to grant\n\n37:31.520 --> 37:36.520\n is that we're never in direct contact with reality,\n\n37:39.680 --> 37:42.840\n whatever it is, unless that reality is consciousness, right?\n\n37:42.840 --> 37:47.320\n So we're only ever experiencing consciousness\n\n37:47.320 --> 37:48.420\n and its contents.\n\n37:48.420 --> 37:53.140\n And then the question is how does that circumstance relate\n\n37:53.140 --> 37:55.980\n to quote reality at large?\n\n37:55.980 --> 38:00.160\n And Donald Hoffman is somebody who's happy to speculate,\n\n38:00.160 --> 38:02.700\n well, maybe there isn't a reality at large.\n\n38:02.700 --> 38:05.620\n Maybe it's all just consciousness on some level.\n\n38:05.620 --> 38:08.340\n And that's interesting.\n\n38:08.340 --> 38:13.340\n That runs into, to my eye, various philosophical problems\n\n38:15.260 --> 38:17.580\n that, or at least you have to do a lot,\n\n38:17.580 --> 38:22.580\n you have to add to that picture of idealism for me.\n\n38:24.820 --> 38:27.460\n That's usually all the whole family of views\n\n38:27.460 --> 38:30.580\n that would just say that the universe is just mind\n\n38:30.580 --> 38:32.940\n or just consciousness at bottom,\n\n38:32.940 --> 38:36.040\n we'll go by the name of idealism in Western philosophy.\n\n38:38.300 --> 38:40.940\n You have to add to that idealistic picture\n\n38:40.940 --> 38:44.860\n all kinds of epicycles and kind of weird coincidences\n\n38:44.860 --> 38:49.860\n and to get the predictability of our experience\n\n38:51.300 --> 38:54.400\n and the success of materialist science\n\n38:54.400 --> 38:56.100\n to make sense in that context, right?\n\n38:56.100 --> 39:00.700\n And so the fact that we can, what does it mean to say\n\n39:00.700 --> 39:05.580\n that there's only consciousness at bottom, right?\n\n39:05.580 --> 39:07.100\n Nothing outside of consciousness\n\n39:07.100 --> 39:08.620\n because no one's ever experienced anything\n\n39:08.620 --> 39:09.540\n outside of consciousness.\n\n39:09.540 --> 39:11.740\n There's no scientist has ever done an experiment\n\n39:11.740 --> 39:14.920\n where they were contemplating data,\n\n39:14.920 --> 39:17.460\n no matter how far removed from our sense bases,\n\n39:17.460 --> 39:20.620\n whether it's they're looking at the Hubble deep field\n\n39:20.620 --> 39:25.620\n or they're smashing atoms or whatever tools they're using,\n\n39:25.620 --> 39:29.020\n they're still just experiencing consciousness\n\n39:29.020 --> 39:32.940\n and its various deliverances\n\n39:32.940 --> 39:37.220\n and layering their concepts on top of that.\n\n39:37.220 --> 39:41.540\n So that's always true.\n\n39:41.540 --> 39:44.740\n And yet that somehow doesn't seem to capture\n\n39:48.340 --> 39:53.340\n the character of our continually discovering\n\n39:53.340 --> 39:58.340\n that our materialist assumptions are confirmable, right?\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:03.360\n So take the fact that we unleash this fantastic amount\n\n40:03.360 --> 40:06.400\n of energy from within an atom, right?\n\n40:06.400 --> 40:09.920\n First, we have the theoretical suggestion\n\n40:09.920 --> 40:12.240\n that it's possible, right?\n\n40:12.240 --> 40:14.160\n We come back to Einstein,\n\n40:14.160 --> 40:18.560\n there's a lot of energy in that matter, right?\n\n40:18.560 --> 40:21.020\n And what if we could release it, right?\n\n40:21.020 --> 40:24.720\n And then we perform an experiment that in this case,\n\n40:24.720 --> 40:28.560\n you know, the Trinity test site in New Mexico,\n\n40:28.560 --> 40:32.000\n where the people who are most adequate to this conversation,\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:33.760\n people like Robert Oppenheimer\n\n40:36.800 --> 40:38.020\n are standing around,\n\n40:38.020 --> 40:41.000\n not altogether certain it's going to work, right?\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:42.120\n They're performing an experiment.\n\n40:42.120 --> 40:43.240\n They're wondering what's gonna happen.\n\n40:43.240 --> 40:45.640\n They're wondering if their calculations around the yield\n\n40:45.640 --> 40:47.680\n are off by orders of magnitude.\n\n40:47.680 --> 40:49.100\n Some of them are still wondering\n\n40:49.100 --> 40:51.840\n whether the entire atmosphere of earth\n\n40:51.840 --> 40:55.360\n is gonna combust, right?\n\n40:55.360 --> 40:59.400\n That the nuclear chain reaction is not gonna stop.\n\n41:01.200 --> 41:04.480\n And lo and behold,\n\n41:04.480 --> 41:07.720\n there was that energy to be released\n\n41:07.720 --> 41:09.840\n from within the nucleus of an atom.\n\n41:09.840 --> 41:14.840\n And that could, so it's just what the picture one forms\n\n41:14.840 --> 41:17.080\n from those kinds of experiments.\n\n41:17.080 --> 41:17.920\n And just the knowledge,\n\n41:17.920 --> 41:19.440\n it's just our understanding of evolution.\n\n41:19.440 --> 41:22.720\n Just the fact that the earth is billions of years old\n\n41:22.720 --> 41:24.520\n and life is hundreds of millions of years old.\n\n41:24.520 --> 41:27.720\n And we weren't here to think about any of those things.\n\n41:28.680 --> 41:30.520\n And all of those processes were happening therefore\n\n41:30.520 --> 41:31.880\n in the dark.\n\n41:31.880 --> 41:35.360\n And they are the processes that allowed us to emerge,\n\n41:35.360 --> 41:38.560\n you know, from prior life forms in the first place.\n\n41:38.560 --> 41:40.440\n To say that it's all a mess,\n\n41:40.440 --> 41:42.160\n that nothing exists,\n\n41:42.160 --> 41:45.080\n outside of consciousness, conscious minds\n\n41:45.080 --> 41:47.600\n of the sort that we experience.\n\n41:47.600 --> 41:48.920\n It just seems,\n\n41:50.640 --> 41:55.640\n it seems like a bizarrely anthropocentric claim,\n\n41:58.200 --> 41:59.720\n you know, analogous to, you know,\n\n41:59.720 --> 42:02.400\n the moon isn't there if no one's looking at it, right?\n\n42:02.400 --> 42:04.760\n I mean, the moon as a moon isn't there\n\n42:04.760 --> 42:05.600\n if no one's looking at it.\n\n42:05.600 --> 42:06.440\n I'll grant that,\n\n42:06.440 --> 42:09.520\n because that's already a kind of fabrication\n\n42:09.520 --> 42:13.360\n born of concepts, but the idea that there's nothing there,\n\n42:13.360 --> 42:15.760\n that there's nothing that corresponds\n\n42:15.760 --> 42:18.000\n to what we experience as the moon,\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:19.800\n unless someone's looking at it,\n\n42:19.800 --> 42:24.800\n that just seems just a way too parochial way\n\n42:25.440 --> 42:27.560\n to set out on this journey of discovery.\n\n42:27.560 --> 42:28.400\n There is something there.\n\n42:28.400 --> 42:30.440\n There's a computer waiting to render the moon\n\n42:30.440 --> 42:32.000\n when you look at it.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.840\n The capacity for the moon to exist is there.\n\n42:34.840 --> 42:36.960\n So if we're looking at the moon,\n\n42:36.960 --> 42:39.640\n the capacity for the moon to exist is there.\n\n42:39.640 --> 42:43.520\n So if we're indeed living in a simulation,\n\n42:43.520 --> 42:46.440\n which I find a compelling thought experiment,\n\n42:46.440 --> 42:50.440\n it's possible that there is this kind of rendering mechanism,\n\n42:50.440 --> 42:53.400\n but not in a silly way that we think about in video games,\n\n42:53.400 --> 42:56.400\n but in some kind of more fundamental physics way.\n\n42:56.400 --> 42:58.800\n And we have to account for the fact\n\n42:58.800 --> 43:03.800\n that it renders experiences that no one has had yet,\n\n43:03.800 --> 43:07.160\n that no one has any expectation of having.\n\n43:07.160 --> 43:10.320\n It can violate the expectations of everyone lawfully.\n\n43:10.320 --> 43:12.200\n And then there's some lawful understanding\n\n43:12.200 --> 43:14.240\n of why that's so.\n\n43:14.240 --> 43:18.320\n It's like, I mean, just to bring it back to mathematics,\n\n43:18.320 --> 43:20.440\n I'm like, certain numbers are prime,\n\n43:20.440 --> 43:22.720\n whether we have discovered them or not.\n\n43:22.720 --> 43:27.640\n There's the highest prime number that anyone can name now.\n\n43:27.640 --> 43:29.200\n And then there's the next prime number\n\n43:29.200 --> 43:31.680\n that no one can name, and it's there.\n\n43:31.680 --> 43:36.600\n So it's like, to say that our minds are putting it there,\n\n43:36.600 --> 43:38.920\n that what we know as mind in ourselves\n\n43:38.920 --> 43:41.400\n is in some way, in some sense, putting it there.\n\n43:43.360 --> 43:47.280\n The base layer of reality is consciousness, right?\n\n43:47.280 --> 43:49.560\n That we're identical to the thing\n\n43:49.560 --> 43:53.280\n that is rendering this reality.\n\n43:53.280 --> 43:57.760\n There's some, you know, hubris is the wrong word,\n\n43:57.760 --> 44:01.760\n but it's like, it's okay if reality is bigger\n\n44:01.760 --> 44:03.320\n than what we experience, you know?\n\n44:03.320 --> 44:08.200\n And it has structure that we can't anticipate,\n\n44:08.200 --> 44:09.600\n and that isn't just,\n\n44:13.560 --> 44:16.720\n I mean, again, there's certainly a collaboration\n\n44:16.720 --> 44:19.640\n between our minds and whatever is out there\n\n44:19.640 --> 44:24.080\n to produce what we call, you know, the stuff of life.\n\n44:24.080 --> 44:29.080\n But it's not, the idea that it's,\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.280\n I don't know, I mean, there are a few stops\n\n44:33.280 --> 44:36.920\n on the train of idealism and kind of new age thinking\n\n44:36.920 --> 44:40.600\n and Eastern philosophy that I don't,\n\n44:40.600 --> 44:42.520\n philosophically, I don't see a need to take.\n\n44:42.520 --> 44:45.960\n I mean, experientially and scientifically,\n\n44:45.960 --> 44:49.520\n I feel like it's, you can get everything you want\n\n44:49.520 --> 44:53.520\n from acknowledging that consciousness\n\n44:53.520 --> 44:58.520\n has a character that can be explored from its own side,\n\n44:58.920 --> 45:01.600\n so that you're bringing kind of the first person experience\n\n45:01.600 --> 45:03.960\n back into the conversation about, you know,\n\n45:03.960 --> 45:06.800\n what is a human mind and, you know, what is true?\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:12.040\n And you can explore it with different degrees of rigor,\n\n45:12.040 --> 45:13.680\n and there are things to be discovered there,\n\n45:13.680 --> 45:15.480\n whether you're using a technique like meditation\n\n45:15.480 --> 45:19.000\n or psychedelics, and that these experiences\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:22.520\n have to be put in conversation with what we understand\n\n45:22.520 --> 45:24.600\n about ourselves from a third person side,\n\n45:24.600 --> 45:27.440\n neuroscientifically or in any other way.\n\n45:27.440 --> 45:30.320\n But to me, the question is, what if reality,\n\n45:30.320 --> 45:34.840\n the sense I have from this kind of, you play shooters?\n\n45:34.840 --> 45:36.040\n No.\n\n45:36.040 --> 45:38.240\n There's a physics engine that generates, that's pretty.\n\n45:38.240 --> 45:40.320\n Yeah, you mean first person shooter games?\n\n45:40.320 --> 45:41.800\n Yes, yes, sorry.\n\n45:41.800 --> 45:43.600\n Not often, but yes.\n\n45:43.600 --> 45:44.760\n I mean, there's a physics engine\n\n45:44.760 --> 45:47.320\n that generates consistent reality, right?\n\n45:47.320 --> 45:50.920\n My sense is the same could be true for a universe\n\n45:51.840 --> 45:54.720\n in the following sense, that our conception of reality\n\n45:54.720 --> 45:57.640\n as we understand it now in the 21st century\n\n45:57.640 --> 45:59.760\n is a tiny subset of the full reality.\n\n45:59.760 --> 46:03.000\n It's not that the reality that we conceive of that's there,\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:06.440\n the moon being there is not there somehow.\n\n46:06.440 --> 46:09.400\n It's that it's a tiny fraction of what's actually out there.\n\n46:09.400 --> 46:12.840\n And so the physics engine of the universe\n\n46:12.840 --> 46:16.120\n is just maintaining the useful physics,\n\n46:16.120 --> 46:19.840\n the useful reality, quote unquote,\n\n46:19.840 --> 46:22.880\n for us to have a consistent experience as human beings.\n\n46:22.880 --> 46:27.880\n But maybe we descendants of apes are really only understand\n\n46:27.920 --> 46:32.920\n like 0.0001% of actual physics of reality.\n\n46:34.040 --> 46:36.600\n We can even just start with the consciousness thing,\n\n46:36.600 --> 46:39.520\n but maybe our minds are just,\n\n46:39.520 --> 46:42.320\n we're just too dumb by design.\n\n46:42.320 --> 46:46.800\n Yeah, I, that truly resonates with me\n\n46:46.800 --> 46:48.320\n and I'm surprised it doesn't resonate more\n\n46:48.320 --> 46:50.960\n with most scientists that I talk to.\n\n46:50.960 --> 46:52.840\n Matthew, when you just look at,\n\n46:52.840 --> 46:57.200\n you look at how close we are to chimps, right?\n\n46:57.200 --> 46:58.920\n And chimps don't know anything, right?\n\n46:58.920 --> 47:01.240\n Clearly they have no idea what's going on, right?\n\n47:01.240 --> 47:03.280\n And then you get us,\n\n47:03.280 --> 47:06.160\n but then it's only a subset of human beings\n\n47:06.160 --> 47:09.880\n that really understand much of what we're talking about\n\n47:09.880 --> 47:12.640\n in any area of specialization.\n\n47:12.640 --> 47:15.680\n And if they all died in their sleep tonight, right?\n\n47:15.680 --> 47:20.640\n You'd be left with people who might take a thousand years\n\n47:20.640 --> 47:24.640\n to rebuild the internet, if ever, right?\n\n47:24.640 --> 47:26.200\n I mean, literally it's like,\n\n47:26.200 --> 47:29.280\n and I would extend this to myself.\n\n47:29.280 --> 47:32.920\n I mean, there are areas of scientific specialization\n\n47:32.920 --> 47:37.480\n where I have either no discernible competence.\n\n47:37.480 --> 47:40.040\n I mean, I spent no time on it.\n\n47:40.040 --> 47:42.120\n I have not acquired the tools.\n\n47:42.120 --> 47:43.960\n It would just be an article of faith for me to think\n\n47:43.960 --> 47:45.120\n that I could acquire the tools\n\n47:45.120 --> 47:47.400\n to actually make a breakthrough in those areas.\n\n47:48.400 --> 47:50.520\n And I mean, your own area is one.\n\n47:50.520 --> 47:54.080\n I mean, I've never spent any significant amount of time\n\n47:54.080 --> 47:56.400\n trying to be a programmer,\n\n47:56.400 --> 48:00.360\n but it's pretty obvious I'm not Alan Turing, right?\n\n48:00.360 --> 48:03.760\n It's like, if that were my capacity,\n\n48:03.760 --> 48:05.840\n I would have discovered that in myself.\n\n48:05.840 --> 48:08.360\n I would have found programming irresistible.\n\n48:08.360 --> 48:13.360\n My first false starts in learning, I think it was C,\n\n48:15.080 --> 48:17.280\n it was just, you know, I bounced off.\n\n48:17.280 --> 48:18.360\n It's like, this was not fun.\n\n48:18.360 --> 48:20.200\n I hate, I mean, I hate trying to figure out\n\n48:20.200 --> 48:22.960\n what the syntax error that's causing this thing\n\n48:22.960 --> 48:25.760\n not to compile was just a fucking awful experience.\n\n48:25.760 --> 48:26.600\n I hated it, right?\n\n48:26.600 --> 48:28.000\n I hated every minute of it.\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:33.000\n So it was not, so if it was just people like me left,\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.840\n like when do we get the internet again, right?\n\n48:35.840 --> 48:39.000\n And we lose, we lose, you know, we lose the internet.\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:40.000\n When do we get it again, right?\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:44.040\n When do we get anything like a proper science\n\n48:44.040 --> 48:45.600\n of information, right?\n\n48:45.600 --> 48:49.280\n You need a Claude Shannon or an Alan Turing\n\n48:49.280 --> 48:52.120\n to plant a flag in the ground right here and say,\n\n48:52.120 --> 48:53.440\n all right, can everyone see this?\n\n48:53.440 --> 48:56.080\n Even if you don't quite know what I'm up to,\n\n48:56.080 --> 49:00.440\n you all have to come over here to make some progress.\n\n49:00.440 --> 49:03.000\n And, you know, there are, you know,\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:05.640\n hundreds of topics where that's the case.\n\n49:05.640 --> 49:10.640\n So we barely have a purchase on making anything\n\n49:10.800 --> 49:15.800\n like discernible intellectual progress in any generation.\n\n49:16.120 --> 49:21.120\n And yeah, I'm just, Max Tegmark makes this point.\n\n49:21.600 --> 49:25.800\n He's one of the few people who does in physics.\n\n49:26.800 --> 49:28.840\n If you just look at the numbers,\n\n49:28.840 --> 49:33.840\n if you just take the truth of evolution seriously, right?\n\n49:36.360 --> 49:39.800\n And realize that there's nothing about us\n\n49:39.800 --> 49:42.760\n that has evolved to understand reality perfectly.\n\n49:42.760 --> 49:46.360\n I mean, we're just not that kind of ape, right?\n\n49:46.360 --> 49:48.640\n There's been no evolutionary pressure along those lines.\n\n49:48.640 --> 49:52.400\n So what we are making do with tools\n\n49:52.400 --> 49:56.060\n that were designed for fights with sticks and rocks, right?\n\n49:56.060 --> 50:00.420\n And it's amazing we can do as much as we can.\n\n50:00.420 --> 50:02.380\n I mean, we just, you know, the UNR just sitting here\n\n50:02.380 --> 50:05.780\n on the back of having received an mRNA vaccine,\n\n50:05.780 --> 50:08.460\n you know, that has certainly changed our life\n\n50:08.460 --> 50:10.620\n given what the last year was like.\n\n50:10.620 --> 50:12.180\n And it's gonna change the world\n\n50:12.180 --> 50:16.460\n if rumors of coming miracles are born out.\n\n50:16.460 --> 50:20.780\n I mean, it's now, it seems likely we have a vaccine\n\n50:20.780 --> 50:22.240\n coming for malaria, right?\n\n50:22.240 --> 50:25.920\n Which has been killing millions of people a year\n\n50:25.920 --> 50:28.420\n for as long as we've been alive.\n\n50:28.420 --> 50:31.260\n I think it's down to like 800,000 people a year now\n\n50:31.260 --> 50:33.900\n because we've spread so many bed nets around,\n\n50:33.900 --> 50:37.360\n but it was like two and a half million people every year.\n\n50:39.340 --> 50:43.380\n It's amazing what we can do, but yeah, I have,\n\n50:43.380 --> 50:46.820\n if in fact the answer at the back of the book of nature\n\n50:46.820 --> 50:51.820\n is you understand 0.1% of what there is to understand\n\n50:52.100 --> 50:54.900\n and half of what you think you understand is wrong,\n\n50:54.900 --> 50:57.300\n that would not surprise me at all.\n\n50:58.420 --> 51:01.020\n It is funny to look at our evolutionary history,\n\n51:01.020 --> 51:03.620\n even back to chimps, I'm pretty sure even chimps\n\n51:03.620 --> 51:06.340\n thought they understood the world well.\n\n51:06.340 --> 51:09.300\n So at every point in that timeline\n\n51:09.300 --> 51:12.860\n of evolutionary development throughout human history,\n\n51:12.860 --> 51:15.560\n there's a sense like there's no more,\n\n51:15.560 --> 51:17.020\n you hear this message over and over,\n\n51:17.020 --> 51:19.380\n there's no more things to be invented.\n\n51:19.380 --> 51:21.300\n But a hundred years ago there were,\n\n51:21.300 --> 51:24.940\n there's a famous story, I forget which physicist told it,\n\n51:24.940 --> 51:29.060\n but there were physicists telling\n\n51:29.060 --> 51:32.820\n their undergraduate students not to go into,\n\n51:32.820 --> 51:34.260\n to get graduate degrees in physics\n\n51:34.260 --> 51:36.580\n because basically all the problems had been solved.\n\n51:36.580 --> 51:40.140\n And this is like around 1915 or so.\n\n51:40.140 --> 51:41.300\n It turns out you were right.\n\n51:41.300 --> 51:42.720\n I'm gonna ask you about free will.\n\n51:42.720 --> 51:43.560\n Oh, okay.\n\n51:44.820 --> 51:48.240\n You've recently released an episode of your podcast,\n\n51:48.240 --> 51:51.580\n Making Sense, for those with a shorter attention span,\n\n51:51.580 --> 51:54.000\n basically summarizing your position on free will.\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.240\n I think it was under an hour and a half.\n\n51:56.240 --> 51:57.080\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n51:57.080 --> 52:00.520\n It was brief and clear.\n\n52:01.820 --> 52:05.300\n So allow me to summarize the summary, TLDR,\n\n52:05.300 --> 52:07.380\n and maybe you tell me where I'm wrong.\n\n52:08.380 --> 52:11.380\n So free will is an illusion,\n\n52:11.380 --> 52:13.980\n and even the experience of free will is an illusion.\n\n52:13.980 --> 52:15.940\n Like we don't even experience it.\n\n52:15.940 --> 52:19.940\n Am I good in my summary?\n\n52:20.860 --> 52:25.500\n Yeah, this is a line that's a little hard\n\n52:25.500 --> 52:27.360\n to scan for people.\n\n52:27.360 --> 52:32.340\n I say that it's not merely that free will is an illusion.\n\n52:32.340 --> 52:35.100\n The illusion of free will is an illusion.\n\n52:35.100 --> 52:37.460\n Like there is no illusion of free will.\n\n52:37.460 --> 52:40.620\n And that is a, unlike many other illusions,\n\n52:40.620 --> 52:45.620\n that's a more fundamental claim.\n\n52:47.100 --> 52:49.500\n It's not that it's wrong, it's not even wrong.\n\n52:49.500 --> 52:52.200\n I mean, I guess that was I think Wolfgang Pauli\n\n52:52.200 --> 52:56.380\n who derided one of his colleagues or enemies\n\n52:56.380 --> 53:01.380\n with that aspersion about his theory in quantum mechanics.\n\n53:06.860 --> 53:09.780\n So there are things that, there are genuine illusions.\n\n53:09.780 --> 53:12.700\n There are things that you do experience\n\n53:12.700 --> 53:15.120\n and then you can kind of punch through that experience,\n\n53:15.120 --> 53:17.300\n or you can't actually experience,\n\n53:17.300 --> 53:20.100\n you can't experience them any other way.\n\n53:20.100 --> 53:24.060\n It's just, we just know it's not a veridical experience.\n\n53:24.060 --> 53:25.340\n You just take like a visual illusion.\n\n53:25.340 --> 53:26.940\n There are visual illusions that,\n\n53:26.940 --> 53:28.700\n a lot of these come to me on Twitter these days.\n\n53:28.700 --> 53:31.000\n There's these amazing visual illusions\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:36.000\n where like every figure in this GIF seems to be moving,\n\n53:36.380 --> 53:37.700\n but nothing in fact is moving.\n\n53:37.700 --> 53:39.180\n You can just like put a ruler on your screen\n\n53:39.180 --> 53:40.220\n and nothing's moving.\n\n53:42.260 --> 53:44.500\n Some of those illusions you can't see any other way.\n\n53:44.500 --> 53:46.840\n I mean, they're just, they're hacking aspects\n\n53:46.840 --> 53:49.860\n of the visual system that are just eminently hackable\n\n53:49.860 --> 53:54.360\n and you have to use a ruler to convince yourself\n\n53:54.360 --> 53:56.460\n that the thing isn't actually moving.\n\n53:56.460 --> 53:57.840\n Now there are other visual illusions\n\n53:57.840 --> 54:01.140\n where you're taken in by it at first,\n\n54:01.140 --> 54:02.540\n but if you pay more attention,\n\n54:02.540 --> 54:05.260\n you can actually see that it's not there, right?\n\n54:05.260 --> 54:07.580\n Or it's not how it first seemed.\n\n54:07.580 --> 54:10.160\n Like the Necker cube is a good example of that.\n\n54:10.160 --> 54:13.260\n Like the Necker cube is just that schematic of a cube,\n\n54:13.260 --> 54:15.900\n of a transparent cube, which pops out one way or the other.\n\n54:15.900 --> 54:17.860\n Then one face can pop out and then the other face\n\n54:17.860 --> 54:18.900\n can pop out.\n\n54:18.900 --> 54:22.140\n But you can actually just see it as flat with no pop out,\n\n54:22.140 --> 54:26.140\n which is a more veridical way of looking at it.\n\n54:27.900 --> 54:29.900\n So there are subject,\n\n54:29.900 --> 54:32.300\n there are kind of inward correlates to this.\n\n54:32.300 --> 54:37.300\n And I would say that the sense of self and free will\n\n54:39.700 --> 54:40.660\n are closely related.\n\n54:40.660 --> 54:43.460\n I mean, I often describe them as two sides of the same coin,\n\n54:43.460 --> 54:48.460\n but they're not quite the same in their spuriousness.\n\n54:49.260 --> 54:52.420\n I mean, so the sense of self is something that people,\n\n54:52.420 --> 54:54.560\n I think, do experience, right?\n\n54:54.560 --> 54:58.340\n It's not a very clear experience, but it's not,\n\n54:58.340 --> 55:00.920\n I wouldn't call the illusion of self an illusion,\n\n55:00.920 --> 55:03.260\n but the illusion of free will is an illusion\n\n55:03.260 --> 55:07.300\n in that as you pay more attention to your experience,\n\n55:07.300 --> 55:10.500\n you begin to see that it's totally compatible\n\n55:10.500 --> 55:11.800\n with an absence of free will.\n\n55:11.800 --> 55:14.620\n You don't, I mean coming back to the place we started,\n\n55:15.660 --> 55:18.460\n you don't know what you're gonna think next.\n\n55:18.460 --> 55:20.300\n You don't know what you're gonna intend next.\n\n55:20.300 --> 55:23.400\n You don't know what's going to just occur to you\n\n55:23.400 --> 55:24.540\n that you must do next.\n\n55:24.540 --> 55:28.020\n You don't know how much you are going to feel\n\n55:28.020 --> 55:31.660\n the behavioral imperative to act on that thought.\n\n55:31.660 --> 55:35.340\n If you suddenly feel, oh, I don't need to do that.\n\n55:35.340 --> 55:36.740\n I can do that tomorrow.\n\n55:36.740 --> 55:38.100\n You don't know where that comes from.\n\n55:38.100 --> 55:39.620\n You didn't know that was gonna arise.\n\n55:39.620 --> 55:41.580\n You didn't know that was gonna be compelling.\n\n55:41.580 --> 55:44.140\n All of this is compatible with some evil genius\n\n55:44.140 --> 55:47.980\n in the next room just typing in code into your experience.\n\n55:47.980 --> 55:50.080\n It's like this, okay, let's give him the,\n\n55:51.220 --> 55:53.940\n oh my God, I just forgot it was gonna be our anniversary\n\n55:53.940 --> 55:56.060\n in one week thought, right?\n\n55:56.060 --> 55:57.980\n Give him the cascade of fear.\n\n55:59.060 --> 56:01.600\n Give him this brilliant idea for the thing he can buy\n\n56:01.600 --> 56:02.860\n that's gonna take him no time at all\n\n56:02.860 --> 56:05.300\n and this overpowering sense of relief.\n\n56:05.300 --> 56:07.820\n All of our experiences is compatible\n\n56:07.820 --> 56:11.700\n with the script already being written, right?\n\n56:11.700 --> 56:12.980\n And I'm not saying the script is written.\n\n56:12.980 --> 56:17.340\n I'm not saying that fatalism is the right way\n\n56:17.340 --> 56:20.180\n to look at this, but we just don't have\n\n56:20.180 --> 56:23.420\n even our most deliberate voluntary action\n\n56:23.420 --> 56:27.060\n where we go back and forth between two options,\n\n56:27.060 --> 56:28.580\n thinking about the reason for A\n\n56:28.580 --> 56:30.480\n and then reconsidering and going,\n\n56:31.740 --> 56:34.100\n thinking harder about B and just going\n\n56:34.100 --> 56:37.980\n eeny, meeny, miny, moe until the end of the hour.\n\n56:37.980 --> 56:40.320\n However laborious you can make it,\n\n56:40.320 --> 56:44.500\n there is a utter mystery at your back\n\n56:44.500 --> 56:48.940\n finally promoting the thought or intention\n\n56:48.940 --> 56:53.860\n or rationale that is most compelling\n\n56:53.860 --> 56:58.860\n and therefore behaviorally effective.\n\n57:07.420 --> 57:09.280\n And this can drive some people a little crazy.\n\n57:09.280 --> 57:13.740\n So I usually preface what I say about free will\n\n57:13.740 --> 57:17.260\n with the caveat that if thinking about your mind this way\n\n57:17.260 --> 57:19.820\n makes you feel terrible, well then stop.\n\n57:19.820 --> 57:22.420\n You get off the ride, switch the channel.\n\n57:22.420 --> 57:24.580\n You don't have to go down this path.\n\n57:24.580 --> 57:27.520\n But for me and for many other people,\n\n57:27.520 --> 57:32.140\n it's incredibly freeing to recognize this about the mind\n\n57:32.140 --> 57:37.140\n because one, you realize that you're,\n\n57:38.180 --> 57:39.940\n cutting through the illusion of the self\n\n57:39.940 --> 57:41.820\n is immensely freeing for a lot of reasons\n\n57:41.820 --> 57:44.020\n that we can talk about separately,\n\n57:44.020 --> 57:49.020\n but losing the sense of free will does\n\n57:49.660 --> 57:51.500\n two things very vividly for me.\n\n57:51.500 --> 57:54.780\n One is it totally undercuts the basis for,\n\n57:54.780 --> 57:56.620\n the psychological basis for hatred.\n\n57:56.620 --> 57:59.000\n Because when you think about the experience\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:03.540\n of hating other people, what that is anchored to\n\n58:03.540 --> 58:06.320\n is a feeling that they really are\n\n58:06.320 --> 58:08.640\n the true authors of their actions.\n\n58:08.640 --> 58:10.820\n I mean, if someone is doing something\n\n58:10.820 --> 58:13.220\n that you find so despicable, right?\n\n58:13.220 --> 58:15.940\n Let's say they're targeting you unfairly, right?\n\n58:15.940 --> 58:20.260\n They're maligning you on Twitter or they're suing you\n\n58:20.260 --> 58:22.880\n or they're doing something, they broke your car window,\n\n58:22.880 --> 58:24.700\n they did something awful\n\n58:24.700 --> 58:26.660\n and now you have a grievance against them.\n\n58:26.660 --> 58:30.060\n And you're relating to them very differently emotionally\n\n58:30.060 --> 58:32.400\n in your own mind than you would\n\n58:32.400 --> 58:34.560\n if a force of nature had done this, right?\n\n58:34.560 --> 58:36.740\n Or if it's, if it had just been a virus\n\n58:36.740 --> 58:39.040\n or if it had been a wild animal\n\n58:39.040 --> 58:40.740\n or a malfunctioning machine, right?\n\n58:40.740 --> 58:42.260\n Like to those things you don't attribute\n\n58:42.260 --> 58:44.220\n any kind of freedom of will.\n\n58:44.220 --> 58:47.000\n And while you may suffer the consequences\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:49.980\n of catching a virus or being attacked by a wild animal\n\n58:49.980 --> 58:53.140\n or having your car break down or whatever,\n\n58:53.140 --> 58:54.940\n it may frustrate you.\n\n58:56.060 --> 59:01.060\n You don't slip into this mode of hating the agent\n\n59:01.240 --> 59:06.240\n in a way that completely commandeers your mind\n\n59:06.780 --> 59:07.840\n and deranges your life.\n\n59:07.840 --> 59:09.260\n I mean, you just don't, I mean, there are people\n\n59:09.260 --> 59:14.260\n who spend decades hating other people for what they did\n\n59:15.820 --> 59:18.580\n and it's just pure poison, right?\n\n59:18.580 --> 59:20.900\n So it's a useful shortcut to compassion and empathy.\n\n59:20.900 --> 59:21.740\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n59:21.740 --> 59:24.740\n But the question is, say that this called,\n\n59:24.740 --> 59:26.800\n what was it, the horse of consciousness?\n\n59:26.800 --> 59:30.700\n Let's call it the consciousness generator black box\n\n59:30.700 --> 59:32.560\n that we don't understand.\n\n59:32.560 --> 59:35.980\n And is it possible that the script\n\n59:35.980 --> 59:40.780\n that we're walking along, that we're playing,\n\n59:40.780 --> 59:43.900\n that's already written is actually being written\n\n59:43.900 --> 59:45.220\n in real time.\n\n59:45.220 --> 59:47.680\n It's almost like you're driving down a road\n\n59:47.680 --> 59:50.860\n and in real time, that road is being laid down.\n\n59:50.860 --> 59:53.940\n And this black box of consciousness that we don't understand\n\n59:53.940 --> 59:57.060\n is the place where the script is being generated.\n\n59:57.060 --> 1:00:01.180\n So it's not, it is being generated, it didn't always exist.\n\n1:00:01.180 --> 1:00:02.780\n So there's something we don't understand\n\n1:00:02.780 --> 1:00:05.500\n that's fundamental about the nature of reality\n\n1:00:05.500 --> 1:00:07.520\n that generates both consciousness,\n\n1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:09.860\n let's call it maybe the self.\n\n1:00:09.860 --> 1:00:11.580\n I don't know if you want to distinguish between those.\n\n1:00:11.580 --> 1:00:13.040\n Yeah, I definitely would, yeah.\n\n1:00:13.040 --> 1:00:15.780\n You would, because there's a bunch of illusions\n\n1:00:15.780 --> 1:00:16.620\n we're referring to.\n\n1:00:16.620 --> 1:00:18.220\n There's the illusion of free will,\n\n1:00:18.220 --> 1:00:20.260\n there's the illusion of self,\n\n1:00:20.260 --> 1:00:22.440\n and there's the illusion of consciousness.\n\n1:00:22.440 --> 1:00:25.840\n You're saying, I think you said there's no,\n\n1:00:25.840 --> 1:00:27.020\n you're not as willing to say\n\n1:00:27.020 --> 1:00:28.820\n there's an illusion of consciousness.\n\n1:00:28.820 --> 1:00:29.660\n You're a little bit more.\n\n1:00:29.660 --> 1:00:30.860\n In fact, I would say it's impossible.\n\n1:00:30.860 --> 1:00:31.700\n Impossible.\n\n1:00:31.700 --> 1:00:33.260\n You're a little bit more willing to say\n\n1:00:33.260 --> 1:00:35.540\n that there's an illusion of self,\n\n1:00:35.540 --> 1:00:36.940\n and you're definitely saying\n\n1:00:36.940 --> 1:00:38.580\n there's an illusion of free will.\n\n1:00:38.580 --> 1:00:42.060\n Yes, I'm definitely saying there's an illusion\n\n1:00:42.060 --> 1:00:44.060\n that a certain kind of self is an illusion.\n\n1:00:44.060 --> 1:00:46.340\n Not every, we mean many different things\n\n1:00:46.340 --> 1:00:47.980\n by this notion of self.\n\n1:00:47.980 --> 1:00:50.520\n So maybe I should just differentiate these things.\n\n1:00:50.520 --> 1:00:53.020\n So consciousness can't be an illusion\n\n1:00:53.020 --> 1:00:58.020\n because any illusion proves its reality\n\n1:00:58.080 --> 1:01:00.460\n as much as any other veridical perception.\n\n1:01:00.460 --> 1:01:02.560\n I mean, if you're hallucinating now,\n\n1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:05.660\n that's just as much of a demonstration of consciousness\n\n1:01:05.660 --> 1:01:09.700\n as really seeing what's a quote actually there.\n\n1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:11.940\n If you're dreaming and you don't know it,\n\n1:01:12.940 --> 1:01:15.500\n that is consciousness, right?\n\n1:01:15.500 --> 1:01:17.740\n You can be confused about literally everything.\n\n1:01:17.740 --> 1:01:22.740\n You can't be confused about the underlying claim,\n\n1:01:25.180 --> 1:01:27.580\n whether you make it linguistically or not,\n\n1:01:27.580 --> 1:01:32.580\n but just the cognitive assertion\n\n1:01:34.700 --> 1:01:36.960\n that something seems to be happening.\n\n1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:40.420\n It's the seeming that is the cash value of consciousness.\n\n1:01:40.420 --> 1:01:42.020\n Can I take a tiny tangent?\n\n1:01:42.020 --> 1:01:47.020\n So what if I am creating consciousness in my mind\n\n1:01:47.660 --> 1:01:50.100\n to convince you that I'm human?\n\n1:01:50.100 --> 1:01:52.540\n So it's a useful social tool,\n\n1:01:52.540 --> 1:01:57.540\n not a fundamental property of experience,\n\n1:01:57.940 --> 1:02:00.760\n like of being a living thing.\n\n1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:02.660\n What if it's just like a social tool\n\n1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:07.580\n to almost like a useful computational trick\n\n1:02:07.580 --> 1:02:10.580\n to place myself into reality\n\n1:02:10.580 --> 1:02:13.180\n as we together communicate about this reality?\n\n1:02:14.100 --> 1:02:15.940\n And another way to ask that,\n\n1:02:15.940 --> 1:02:17.540\n because you said it much earlier,\n\n1:02:18.500 --> 1:02:21.340\n you talk negatively about robots as you often do.\n\n1:02:21.340 --> 1:02:24.320\n So let me, because you'll probably die first\n\n1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:25.220\n when they take over.\n\n1:02:26.260 --> 1:02:28.700\n No, I'm looking forward to certain kinds of robots.\n\n1:02:28.700 --> 1:02:31.080\n I mean, I'm not, if we can get this right,\n\n1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:32.060\n this would be amazing.\n\n1:02:32.060 --> 1:02:34.500\n But you don't like the robots that fake consciousness.\n\n1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:35.340\n That's what you,\n\n1:02:35.340 --> 1:02:37.860\n you don't like the idea of fake it till you make it.\n\n1:02:37.860 --> 1:02:40.140\n Well, no, it's not that I don't like it.\n\n1:02:40.140 --> 1:02:43.420\n It's that I'm worried that we will lose sight\n\n1:02:43.420 --> 1:02:44.300\n of the problem.\n\n1:02:44.300 --> 1:02:47.260\n And the problem has massive ethical consequences.\n\n1:02:47.260 --> 1:02:51.940\n I mean, if we create robots that really can suffer,\n\n1:02:51.940 --> 1:02:53.660\n that would be a bad thing, right?\n\n1:02:53.660 --> 1:02:56.460\n And if we really are committing a murder\n\n1:02:56.460 --> 1:02:59.220\n when we recycle them, that would be a bad thing.\n\n1:02:59.220 --> 1:03:00.300\n This is how I know you're not Russian.\n\n1:03:00.300 --> 1:03:03.260\n Why is it a bad thing that we create robots that can suffer?\n\n1:03:03.260 --> 1:03:05.280\n Isn't suffering a fundamental thing\n\n1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:07.240\n from which like beauty springs?\n\n1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:08.580\n Like without suffering,\n\n1:03:08.580 --> 1:03:10.300\n do you really think we would have beautiful things\n\n1:03:10.300 --> 1:03:11.700\n in this world?\n\n1:03:11.700 --> 1:03:14.700\n Okay, that's a tangent on a tangent.\n\n1:03:14.700 --> 1:03:15.540\n We'll go there.\n\n1:03:15.540 --> 1:03:17.100\n I would love to go there, but let's not go there just yet.\n\n1:03:17.100 --> 1:03:17.940\n All right.\n\n1:03:17.940 --> 1:03:20.340\n But I do think it would be, if anything is bad,\n\n1:03:20.340 --> 1:03:22.780\n creating hell and populating it\n\n1:03:22.780 --> 1:03:27.020\n with real minds that really can suffer in that hell,\n\n1:03:27.020 --> 1:03:28.940\n that's bad.\n\n1:03:28.940 --> 1:03:33.940\n You are worse than any mass murderer we can name\n\n1:03:34.660 --> 1:03:35.540\n if you create it.\n\n1:03:35.540 --> 1:03:37.300\n I mean, this could be in robot form,\n\n1:03:37.300 --> 1:03:41.440\n or more likely it would be in some simulation of a world\n\n1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:43.740\n where we managed to populate it with conscious minds\n\n1:03:43.740 --> 1:03:46.280\n whether we knew they were conscious or not.\n\n1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:49.780\n And that world is a state of, it's unendurable.\n\n1:03:50.600 --> 1:03:53.200\n That would just, it just taking the thesis seriously\n\n1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:58.140\n that there's nothing that mind intelligence\n\n1:03:58.140 --> 1:04:00.780\n and consciousness ultimately are substrate independent.\n\n1:04:00.780 --> 1:04:01.620\n Right?\n\n1:04:01.620 --> 1:04:02.760\n It doesn't, you don't need a biological brain\n\n1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:03.600\n to be conscious.\n\n1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:04.780\n You certainly don't need a biological brain\n\n1:04:04.780 --> 1:04:05.660\n to be intelligent.\n\n1:04:05.660 --> 1:04:06.500\n Right?\n\n1:04:06.500 --> 1:04:09.040\n So if we just imagine the consciousness at some point\n\n1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:12.560\n comes along for the ride as you scale up in intelligence,\n\n1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:16.020\n well then we could find ourselves creating conscious minds\n\n1:04:16.020 --> 1:04:17.180\n that are miserable, right?\n\n1:04:17.180 --> 1:04:19.740\n And that's just like creating a person who's miserable.\n\n1:04:19.740 --> 1:04:20.580\n Right?\n\n1:04:20.580 --> 1:04:21.900\n It could be worse than creating a person who's miserable.\n\n1:04:21.900 --> 1:04:23.780\n It could be even more sensitive to suffering.\n\n1:04:23.780 --> 1:04:26.300\n Cloning them and maybe for entertainment\n\n1:04:26.300 --> 1:04:27.980\n and watching them suffer.\n\n1:04:27.980 --> 1:04:31.700\n Just like watching a person suffer for entertainment.\n\n1:04:31.700 --> 1:04:32.700\n You know?\n\n1:04:32.700 --> 1:04:36.060\n So, but back to your primary question here,\n\n1:04:36.060 --> 1:04:40.580\n which is differentiating consciousness and self\n\n1:04:40.580 --> 1:04:42.060\n and free will as concepts\n\n1:04:42.060 --> 1:04:46.820\n and kind of degrees of illusoriness.\n\n1:04:46.820 --> 1:04:48.740\n The problem with free will is that\n\n1:04:50.460 --> 1:04:53.040\n what most people mean by it,\n\n1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:56.140\n and this is where Dan Dennett\n\n1:04:56.140 --> 1:04:57.580\n is gonna get off the ride here, right?\n\n1:04:57.580 --> 1:04:59.980\n So like he doesn't, he's gonna disagree with me\n\n1:04:59.980 --> 1:05:02.260\n that I know what most people mean by it.\n\n1:05:02.260 --> 1:05:07.260\n But I have a very keen sense having talked about this topic\n\n1:05:07.700 --> 1:05:09.340\n for many, many years\n\n1:05:09.340 --> 1:05:13.300\n and seeing people get wrapped around the axle of it\n\n1:05:13.300 --> 1:05:17.980\n and seeing in myself what it's like to have felt\n\n1:05:17.980 --> 1:05:20.020\n that I was a self that had free will\n\n1:05:20.020 --> 1:05:22.220\n and then to no longer feel that way, right?\n\n1:05:22.220 --> 1:05:24.600\n To know what it's like to actually disabuse myself\n\n1:05:24.600 --> 1:05:29.600\n of that sense cognitively and emotionally\n\n1:05:30.040 --> 1:05:32.700\n and to recognize what's left, what goes away\n\n1:05:32.700 --> 1:05:35.980\n and what doesn't go away on the basis of that epiphany.\n\n1:05:35.980 --> 1:05:40.620\n I have a sense that I know what people think they have\n\n1:05:40.620 --> 1:05:44.460\n in hand when they worry about whether free will exists.\n\n1:05:44.460 --> 1:05:49.460\n And it is the flip side of this feeling of self.\n\n1:05:50.220 --> 1:05:51.500\n It's the flip side of feeling\n\n1:05:51.500 --> 1:05:56.500\n like you are not merely identical to experience.\n\n1:05:57.020 --> 1:05:59.020\n You feel like you're having an experience.\n\n1:05:59.020 --> 1:06:00.380\n You feel like you're an agent\n\n1:06:00.380 --> 1:06:02.220\n that is appropriating an experience.\n\n1:06:02.220 --> 1:06:05.100\n There's a protagonist in the movie of your life\n\n1:06:05.100 --> 1:06:06.220\n and it is you.\n\n1:06:07.260 --> 1:06:09.420\n It's not just the movie, right?\n\n1:06:09.420 --> 1:06:13.420\n It's like there's sights and sounds and sensations\n\n1:06:13.420 --> 1:06:14.660\n and thoughts and emotions\n\n1:06:14.660 --> 1:06:17.840\n and this whole cacophony of experience,\n\n1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:21.320\n of felt experience, of felt experience of embodiment.\n\n1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:26.060\n But there seems to be a rider on the horse\n\n1:06:26.060 --> 1:06:28.380\n or a passenger in the body, right?\n\n1:06:28.380 --> 1:06:30.820\n People don't feel truly identical to their bodies\n\n1:06:30.820 --> 1:06:32.780\n down to their toes.\n\n1:06:32.780 --> 1:06:34.760\n They sort of feel like they have bodies.\n\n1:06:34.760 --> 1:06:37.100\n They feel like their minds in bodies\n\n1:06:37.100 --> 1:06:42.100\n and that feels like a self, that feels like me.\n\n1:06:42.220 --> 1:06:45.080\n And again, this gets very paradoxical\n\n1:06:45.080 --> 1:06:47.420\n when you talk about the experience\n\n1:06:47.420 --> 1:06:50.100\n of being in relationship to yourself\n\n1:06:50.100 --> 1:06:52.400\n or talking to yourself, giving yourself a pep talk.\n\n1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:54.220\n I mean, if you're the one talking,\n\n1:06:54.220 --> 1:06:55.800\n why are you also the one listening?\n\n1:06:55.800 --> 1:06:57.900\n Like, why do you need the pep talk and why does it work\n\n1:06:57.900 --> 1:07:00.020\n if you're the one giving the pep talk, right?\n\n1:07:00.020 --> 1:07:02.120\n Or if I say like, where are my keys?\n\n1:07:02.120 --> 1:07:03.780\n Or if I'm looking for my keys,\n\n1:07:03.780 --> 1:07:06.740\n why do I think the superfluous thought, where are my keys?\n\n1:07:06.740 --> 1:07:08.420\n I know I'm looking for the fucking keys.\n\n1:07:08.420 --> 1:07:11.400\n I'm the one looking, who am I telling\n\n1:07:11.400 --> 1:07:13.840\n that we now need to look for the keys, right?\n\n1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:16.320\n So that duality is weird, but leave that aside.\n\n1:07:17.420 --> 1:07:22.260\n There's the sense, and this becomes very vivid\n\n1:07:22.260 --> 1:07:25.420\n when people try to learn to meditate.\n\n1:07:25.420 --> 1:07:28.720\n Most people, they close their eyes\n\n1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:30.600\n and they're told to pay attention to an object\n\n1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:31.980\n like the breath, say.\n\n1:07:31.980 --> 1:07:35.280\n So you close your eyes and you pay attention to the breath\n\n1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:37.240\n and you can feel it at the tip of your nose\n\n1:07:37.240 --> 1:07:39.480\n or the rising and falling of your abdomen\n\n1:07:40.480 --> 1:07:42.220\n and you're paying attention\n\n1:07:42.220 --> 1:07:44.920\n and you feel something vague there.\n\n1:07:44.920 --> 1:07:46.880\n And then you think, I thought, well, why the breath?\n\n1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:49.680\n Why am I paying attention to the breath?\n\n1:07:49.680 --> 1:07:51.780\n What's so special about the breath?\n\n1:07:51.780 --> 1:07:54.160\n And then you notice you're thinking\n\n1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:55.720\n and you're not paying attention to the breath anymore.\n\n1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:58.000\n And then you realize, okay, the practice is,\n\n1:07:58.000 --> 1:07:59.840\n okay, I should notice thoughts\n\n1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:01.960\n and then I should come back to the breath.\n\n1:08:01.960 --> 1:08:06.800\n But this starting point of the conventional starting point\n\n1:08:06.800 --> 1:08:10.200\n of feeling like you are an agent, very likely in your head,\n\n1:08:10.200 --> 1:08:12.960\n a locus of consciousness, a locus of attention\n\n1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:15.840\n that can strategically pay attention\n\n1:08:15.840 --> 1:08:17.220\n to certain parts of experience.\n\n1:08:17.220 --> 1:08:18.760\n Like I can focus on the breath\n\n1:08:18.760 --> 1:08:20.600\n and then I get lost in thought\n\n1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:22.440\n and now I can come back to the breath\n\n1:08:22.440 --> 1:08:26.120\n and I can open my eyes and I'm over here behind my face\n\n1:08:26.120 --> 1:08:28.680\n looking out at a world that's other than me\n\n1:08:28.680 --> 1:08:31.920\n and there's this kind of subject object perception.\n\n1:08:31.920 --> 1:08:35.200\n And that is the default starting point of selfhood,\n\n1:08:35.200 --> 1:08:36.920\n of subjectivity.\n\n1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:41.480\n And married to that is the sense that\n\n1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:46.280\n I can decide what to do next, right?\n\n1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:50.340\n I am an agent who can pay attention to the cup.\n\n1:08:50.340 --> 1:08:52.020\n I can listen to sounds.\n\n1:08:52.020 --> 1:08:53.580\n There's certain things that I can't control.\n\n1:08:53.580 --> 1:08:54.640\n Certain things are happening to me\n\n1:08:54.640 --> 1:08:55.880\n and I just can't control them.\n\n1:08:55.880 --> 1:08:59.000\n So for instance, if someone asks,\n\n1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:02.400\n well, can you not hear a sound, right?\n\n1:09:02.400 --> 1:09:03.840\n Like don't hear the next sound,\n\n1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:05.280\n don't hear anything for a second,\n\n1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:09.200\n or don't hear, I'm snapping my fingers, don't hear this.\n\n1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:10.120\n Where's your free will?\n\n1:09:10.120 --> 1:09:12.560\n You know, well, like just stop this from coming in.\n\n1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:14.640\n You realize, okay, wait a minute.\n\n1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:18.320\n My abundant freedom does not extend\n\n1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:20.840\n to something as simple as just being able to pay attention\n\n1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:22.560\n to something else than this.\n\n1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:25.860\n Okay, well, so I'm not that kind of free agent,\n\n1:09:25.860 --> 1:09:28.880\n but at least I can decide what I'm gonna do next\n\n1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:32.080\n and I'm gonna pick up this water, right?\n\n1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:36.760\n And there's a feeling of identification\n\n1:09:36.760 --> 1:09:39.720\n with the impulse, with the intention,\n\n1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:41.240\n with the thought that occurs to you,\n\n1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:43.480\n with the feeling of speaking.\n\n1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:45.540\n Like what am I gonna say next?\n\n1:09:45.540 --> 1:09:46.380\n Well, I'm saying it.\n\n1:09:46.380 --> 1:09:48.960\n So here goes, this is me.\n\n1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:50.560\n It feels like I'm the thinker.\n\n1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:53.780\n I'm the one who's in control.\n\n1:09:53.780 --> 1:09:58.780\n But all of that is born of not really paying close attention\n\n1:10:00.020 --> 1:10:01.980\n to what it's like to be you.\n\n1:10:01.980 --> 1:10:05.260\n And so this is where meditation comes in,\n\n1:10:05.260 --> 1:10:09.980\n or this is where, again, you can get at this conceptually.\n\n1:10:09.980 --> 1:10:11.740\n You can unravel the notion of free will\n\n1:10:11.740 --> 1:10:15.760\n just by thinking certain thoughts,\n\n1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:18.900\n but you can't feel that it doesn't exist\n\n1:10:18.900 --> 1:10:20.740\n unless you can pay close attention\n\n1:10:20.740 --> 1:10:22.980\n to how thoughts and intentions arise.\n\n1:10:22.980 --> 1:10:24.620\n So the way to unravel it conceptually\n\n1:10:24.620 --> 1:10:27.340\n is just to realize, okay, I didn't make myself.\n\n1:10:27.340 --> 1:10:28.420\n I didn't make my genes.\n\n1:10:28.420 --> 1:10:29.340\n I didn't make my brain.\n\n1:10:29.340 --> 1:10:31.780\n I didn't make the environmental influences\n\n1:10:31.780 --> 1:10:35.220\n that impinged upon this system for the last 54 years\n\n1:10:35.220 --> 1:10:38.860\n that have produced my brain in precisely the state\n\n1:10:38.860 --> 1:10:42.860\n it's in right now, such and with all of the receptor weightings\n\n1:10:42.860 --> 1:10:45.700\n and densities, and it's just,\n\n1:10:45.700 --> 1:10:48.560\n I'm exactly the machine I am right now\n\n1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:53.560\n through no fault of my own as the experiencing self.\n\n1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:56.900\n I get no credit and I get no blame\n\n1:10:56.900 --> 1:11:00.620\n for the genetics and the environmental influences here.\n\n1:11:00.620 --> 1:11:03.300\n And yet those are the only things\n\n1:11:03.300 --> 1:11:08.300\n that contrive to produce my next thought\n\n1:11:09.380 --> 1:11:12.900\n or impulse or moment of behavior.\n\n1:11:12.900 --> 1:11:14.920\n And if you were going to add something magical\n\n1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:18.620\n to that clockwork, like an immortal soul,\n\n1:11:18.620 --> 1:11:21.620\n you can also notice that you didn't produce your soul.\n\n1:11:21.620 --> 1:11:22.780\n You can't account for the fact\n\n1:11:22.780 --> 1:11:25.980\n that you don't have the soul of someone\n\n1:11:25.980 --> 1:11:28.340\n who doesn't like any of the things you like\n\n1:11:28.340 --> 1:11:29.920\n or wasn't interested in any of the things\n\n1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:33.080\n you were interested in or was a psychopath\n\n1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:35.180\n or had an IQ of 40.\n\n1:11:35.180 --> 1:11:38.700\n I mean, there's nothing about that\n\n1:11:38.700 --> 1:11:41.620\n that the person who believes in a soul\n\n1:11:41.620 --> 1:11:43.100\n can claim to have controlled.\n\n1:11:43.100 --> 1:11:45.860\n And yet that is also totally dispositive\n\n1:11:45.860 --> 1:11:48.400\n of whatever happens next.\n\n1:11:48.400 --> 1:11:51.160\n But everything you've described now,\n\n1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:52.100\n maybe you can correct me,\n\n1:11:52.100 --> 1:11:54.580\n but it kind of speaks to the materialistic nature\n\n1:11:54.580 --> 1:11:55.760\n of the hardware.\n\n1:11:57.340 --> 1:12:01.180\n But even if you add magical ectoplasm software,\n\n1:12:01.180 --> 1:12:03.060\n you didn't produce that either.\n\n1:12:03.060 --> 1:12:08.060\n I know, but if we can think about the actual computation\n\n1:12:08.060 --> 1:12:11.060\n running on the hardware and running on the software,\n\n1:12:11.060 --> 1:12:12.700\n there's something you said recently\n\n1:12:12.700 --> 1:12:17.260\n which you think of culture as an operating system.\n\n1:12:17.260 --> 1:12:21.140\n So if we just remove ourselves a little bit\n\n1:12:21.140 --> 1:12:24.140\n from the conception of human civilization\n\n1:12:24.140 --> 1:12:26.100\n being a collection of humans\n\n1:12:26.100 --> 1:12:28.380\n and rather us just being a distributed\n\n1:12:30.140 --> 1:12:32.180\n computation system on which there's\n\n1:12:32.180 --> 1:12:34.100\n some kind of operating system running,\n\n1:12:34.100 --> 1:12:36.500\n and then the computation that's running\n\n1:12:36.500 --> 1:12:38.940\n is the actual thing that generates\n\n1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:40.520\n the interactions, the communications,\n\n1:12:40.520 --> 1:12:42.820\n and maybe even free will, the experiences\n\n1:12:42.820 --> 1:12:44.260\n of all those free will.\n\n1:12:44.260 --> 1:12:46.140\n Do you ever think of, do you ever try\n\n1:12:46.140 --> 1:12:47.720\n to reframe the world in that way\n\n1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:51.740\n where it's like ideas are just using us,\n\n1:12:51.740 --> 1:12:56.520\n thoughts are using individual nodes in the system,\n\n1:12:56.520 --> 1:12:58.040\n and they're just jumping around,\n\n1:12:58.040 --> 1:13:01.460\n and they also have ability to generate experiences\n\n1:13:01.460 --> 1:13:03.620\n so that we can push those ideas along.\n\n1:13:03.620 --> 1:13:05.820\n And basically the main organisms here\n\n1:13:05.820 --> 1:13:07.980\n are the thoughts, not the humans.\n\n1:13:07.980 --> 1:13:11.860\n Yeah, but then that erodes the boundary\n\n1:13:11.860 --> 1:13:15.220\n between self and world.\n\n1:13:15.220 --> 1:13:16.060\n Right.\n\n1:13:16.060 --> 1:13:19.660\n So then there's no self, really integrated self\n\n1:13:19.660 --> 1:13:22.420\n to have any kind of will at all.\n\n1:13:22.420 --> 1:13:24.500\n Like if you're just a meme plex,\n\n1:13:24.500 --> 1:13:28.680\n I mean, if you're just a collection of memes,\n\n1:13:28.680 --> 1:13:32.020\n and I mean, we're all kind of like currents,\n\n1:13:32.020 --> 1:13:35.960\n like eddies in this river of ideas, right?\n\n1:13:35.960 --> 1:13:40.740\n So it's like, and it seems to have structure,\n\n1:13:40.740 --> 1:13:43.340\n but there's no real boundary between that part\n\n1:13:43.340 --> 1:13:44.960\n of the flow of water and the rest.\n\n1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:47.300\n I mean, if our, and I would say that much\n\n1:13:47.300 --> 1:13:49.660\n of our mind answers to this kind of description.\n\n1:13:49.660 --> 1:13:52.660\n I mean, so much of our mind has been,\n\n1:13:53.500 --> 1:13:55.460\n it's obviously not self generated,\n\n1:13:55.460 --> 1:13:56.940\n and it's not, you're not gonna find it\n\n1:13:56.940 --> 1:13:58.060\n by looking in the brain.\n\n1:13:58.060 --> 1:14:03.060\n It is the result of culture largely,\n\n1:14:03.060 --> 1:14:08.060\n but also, you know, the genes on one side\n\n1:14:10.740 --> 1:14:13.700\n and culture on the other meeting\n\n1:14:13.700 --> 1:14:18.700\n to allow for manifestations of mind\n\n1:14:20.500 --> 1:14:22.500\n that don't, that aren't actually bounded\n\n1:14:22.500 --> 1:14:26.660\n by the person in any clear sense.\n\n1:14:26.660 --> 1:14:31.060\n It was just, I mean, the example I often use here,\n\n1:14:31.060 --> 1:14:33.620\n but there's so many others is just the fact\n\n1:14:33.620 --> 1:14:36.240\n that we're following the rules of English grammar\n\n1:14:36.240 --> 1:14:37.820\n to whatever degree we are.\n\n1:14:37.820 --> 1:14:40.540\n It's not that we certainly haven't consciously represented\n\n1:14:40.540 --> 1:14:42.340\n these rules for ourself.\n\n1:14:42.340 --> 1:14:44.060\n We haven't invented these rules.\n\n1:14:44.060 --> 1:14:48.500\n We haven't, I mean, there are norms of language use\n\n1:14:48.500 --> 1:14:53.060\n that we couldn't even specify because we haven't,\n\n1:14:53.060 --> 1:14:54.300\n you know, we're not grammarians.\n\n1:14:54.300 --> 1:14:56.340\n We're not, we haven't studied this.\n\n1:14:56.340 --> 1:14:58.100\n We don't even have the right concepts,\n\n1:14:58.100 --> 1:14:59.840\n and yet we're following these rules,\n\n1:14:59.840 --> 1:15:03.220\n and we're noticing, you know, we're noticing as, you know,\n\n1:15:03.220 --> 1:15:06.160\n an error when we fail to follow these rules,\n\n1:15:08.060 --> 1:15:11.060\n and virtually every other cultural norm is like that.\n\n1:15:11.060 --> 1:15:13.020\n I mean, these are not things we've invented.\n\n1:15:13.020 --> 1:15:17.060\n You can consciously decide to scrutinize them\n\n1:15:17.060 --> 1:15:21.220\n and override them, but, I mean, just think of,\n\n1:15:21.220 --> 1:15:23.560\n just think of any social situation\n\n1:15:23.560 --> 1:15:27.500\n where you're with other people and you're behaving\n\n1:15:27.500 --> 1:15:31.540\n in ways that are culturally appropriate, right?\n\n1:15:31.540 --> 1:15:32.620\n You're not being, you know,\n\n1:15:32.620 --> 1:15:34.540\n you're not being wild animals together.\n\n1:15:34.540 --> 1:15:36.500\n You're following, you have some expectation\n\n1:15:36.500 --> 1:15:38.940\n of how you shake a person's hand\n\n1:15:38.940 --> 1:15:43.380\n and how you deal with implements on a table,\n\n1:15:43.380 --> 1:15:44.940\n how you have a meal together.\n\n1:15:44.940 --> 1:15:47.500\n Obviously, this can change from culture to culture,\n\n1:15:47.500 --> 1:15:49.300\n and people can be shocked\n\n1:15:49.300 --> 1:15:51.200\n by how different those things are, right?\n\n1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:53.920\n We, you know, we all have foods we find disgusting,\n\n1:15:53.920 --> 1:15:57.100\n but in some countries, dog is not one of those foods, right?\n\n1:15:57.100 --> 1:15:59.140\n And yet, you know, you and I presumably\n\n1:15:59.140 --> 1:16:01.300\n would be horrified to be served dog.\n\n1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:06.980\n Those are not norms that we're,\n\n1:16:06.980 --> 1:16:09.100\n they are outside of us in some way,\n\n1:16:09.100 --> 1:16:13.340\n and yet they're felt very viscerally.\n\n1:16:13.340 --> 1:16:15.940\n I mean, they're certainly felt in their violation.\n\n1:16:15.940 --> 1:16:18.140\n You know, if you are, just imagine,\n\n1:16:18.140 --> 1:16:21.200\n you're in somebody's home,\n\n1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:23.660\n you're eating something that tastes great to you,\n\n1:16:23.660 --> 1:16:25.700\n and you happen to be in Vietnam or wherever,\n\n1:16:25.700 --> 1:16:28.660\n you know, you didn't realize dog was potentially\n\n1:16:28.660 --> 1:16:32.780\n on the menu, and you find out that you've just eaten\n\n1:16:32.780 --> 1:16:37.300\n 10 bites of what is, you know, really a cocker spaniel,\n\n1:16:37.300 --> 1:16:42.300\n and you feel this instantaneous urge to vomit, right,\n\n1:16:42.980 --> 1:16:44.880\n based on an idea, right?\n\n1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:47.040\n Like, so, like, you did not,\n\n1:16:47.040 --> 1:16:49.860\n you're not the author of that norm\n\n1:16:51.020 --> 1:16:55.620\n that gave you such a powerful experience of its violation,\n\n1:16:55.620 --> 1:16:59.620\n and I'm sure we can trace the moment in your history,\n\n1:16:59.620 --> 1:17:01.340\n you know, vaguely, where it sort of got in.\n\n1:17:01.340 --> 1:17:02.940\n I mean, very early on as kids,\n\n1:17:02.940 --> 1:17:05.940\n you realize you're treating dogs as pets\n\n1:17:05.940 --> 1:17:08.400\n and not as food, or as potential food.\n\n1:17:10.460 --> 1:17:15.460\n But yeah, no, it's, but the point you just made\n\n1:17:15.700 --> 1:17:18.980\n opens us to, like, we are totally permeable\n\n1:17:18.980 --> 1:17:22.020\n to a sea of mind.\n\n1:17:22.020 --> 1:17:24.380\n Yeah, but if we take the metaphor\n\n1:17:24.380 --> 1:17:26.220\n of the distributed computing systems,\n\n1:17:26.220 --> 1:17:29.860\n each individual node is,\n\n1:17:29.860 --> 1:17:32.700\n is part of performing a much larger computation,\n\n1:17:32.700 --> 1:17:36.460\n but it nevertheless is in charge of doing the scheduling\n\n1:17:36.460 --> 1:17:39.260\n of, so, assuming it's Linux,\n\n1:17:39.260 --> 1:17:41.060\n is doing the scheduling of processes\n\n1:17:41.060 --> 1:17:42.700\n and is constantly alternating them.\n\n1:17:42.700 --> 1:17:46.200\n That node is making those choices.\n\n1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:49.220\n That node sure as hell believes it has free will,\n\n1:17:49.220 --> 1:17:51.100\n and it actually has free will\n\n1:17:51.100 --> 1:17:53.140\n because it's making those hard choices,\n\n1:17:53.140 --> 1:17:54.860\n but the choices ultimately are part\n\n1:17:54.860 --> 1:17:57.340\n of a much larger computation that it can't control.\n\n1:17:57.340 --> 1:17:59.900\n Isn't it possible for that node to still be,\n\n1:17:59.900 --> 1:18:04.060\n that human node is still making the choice?\n\n1:18:04.060 --> 1:18:05.140\n Well, yeah, it is.\n\n1:18:05.140 --> 1:18:08.820\n So I'm not saying that your body\n\n1:18:08.820 --> 1:18:11.660\n isn't doing, really doing things, right?\n\n1:18:11.660 --> 1:18:14.060\n And some of those things can be\n\n1:18:14.060 --> 1:18:16.420\n conventionally thought of as choices, right?\n\n1:18:16.420 --> 1:18:19.100\n So it's like, I can choose to reach,\n\n1:18:19.100 --> 1:18:21.620\n and it's like, it's not being imposed on me.\n\n1:18:21.620 --> 1:18:22.780\n That would be a different experience.\n\n1:18:22.780 --> 1:18:26.740\n Like, so there's an experience of all,\n\n1:18:26.740 --> 1:18:27.980\n you know, there's definitely a difference\n\n1:18:27.980 --> 1:18:30.740\n between voluntary and involuntary action.\n\n1:18:30.740 --> 1:18:34.060\n There's, so that has to get conserved.\n\n1:18:34.060 --> 1:18:36.580\n By any account of the mind that jettisons free will,\n\n1:18:36.580 --> 1:18:39.260\n you still have to admit that there's a difference\n\n1:18:39.260 --> 1:18:42.920\n between a tremor that I can't control\n\n1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:47.620\n and a purposeful motor action that I can control\n\n1:18:47.620 --> 1:18:49.140\n and I can initiate on demand,\n\n1:18:49.140 --> 1:18:50.940\n and it's associated with intentions.\n\n1:18:50.940 --> 1:18:55.780\n And it's got efferent, you know, motor copy,\n\n1:18:55.780 --> 1:18:59.660\n which is being predictive so that I can notice errors.\n\n1:18:59.660 --> 1:19:00.940\n You know, I have expectations.\n\n1:19:00.940 --> 1:19:02.060\n When I reach for this,\n\n1:19:02.060 --> 1:19:04.440\n if my hand were actually to pass through the bottle,\n\n1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:07.180\n because it's a hologram, I would be surprised, right?\n\n1:19:07.180 --> 1:19:09.180\n And so that shows that I have a expectation\n\n1:19:09.180 --> 1:19:12.140\n of just what my grasping behavior is gonna be like\n\n1:19:12.140 --> 1:19:13.740\n even before it happens.\n\n1:19:13.740 --> 1:19:14.620\n Whereas with a tremor,\n\n1:19:14.620 --> 1:19:17.120\n you don't have the same kind of thing going on.\n\n1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:19.960\n That's a distinction we have to make.\n\n1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:24.960\n So I am, yes, I'm really, my intention to move,\n\n1:19:26.980 --> 1:19:28.980\n which is in fact can be subjectively felt,\n\n1:19:28.980 --> 1:19:31.020\n really is the proximate cause of my moving.\n\n1:19:31.020 --> 1:19:33.300\n It's not coming from elsewhere in the universe.\n\n1:19:33.300 --> 1:19:35.060\n I'm not saying that.\n\n1:19:35.060 --> 1:19:37.580\n So in that sense, the node is really deciding\n\n1:19:37.580 --> 1:19:42.260\n to execute, you know, the subroutine now.\n\n1:19:42.260 --> 1:19:47.260\n But that's not the feeling\n\n1:19:47.260 --> 1:19:52.260\n that has given rise to this conundrum of free will, right?\n\n1:19:54.820 --> 1:19:57.060\n So the people feel like,\n\n1:19:58.680 --> 1:20:01.580\n people feel like the crucial thing is that people feel\n\n1:20:01.580 --> 1:20:04.300\n like they could have done otherwise, right?\n\n1:20:04.300 --> 1:20:05.880\n That's the thing that,\n\n1:20:05.880 --> 1:20:09.500\n so when you run back the clock of your life, right?\n\n1:20:09.500 --> 1:20:11.260\n You run back the movie of your life,\n\n1:20:11.260 --> 1:20:14.640\n you flip back the few pages in the novel of your life,\n\n1:20:14.640 --> 1:20:18.020\n they feel that at this point,\n\n1:20:18.020 --> 1:20:20.820\n they could behave differently than they did, right?\n\n1:20:20.820 --> 1:20:23.260\n So like, but given, you know,\n\n1:20:23.260 --> 1:20:25.880\n even given your distributed computing example,\n\n1:20:27.780 --> 1:20:30.500\n it's either a fully deterministic system\n\n1:20:30.500 --> 1:20:32.140\n or it's a deterministic system\n\n1:20:32.140 --> 1:20:36.220\n that admits of some random, you know, influence.\n\n1:20:36.220 --> 1:20:37.780\n In either case,\n\n1:20:39.540 --> 1:20:41.580\n that's not the free will people think they have.\n\n1:20:41.580 --> 1:20:45.540\n The free will people think they have is, damn,\n\n1:20:45.540 --> 1:20:46.540\n I shouldn't have done that.\n\n1:20:46.540 --> 1:20:49.440\n I just like, I shouldn't have done that.\n\n1:20:49.440 --> 1:20:51.420\n I could have done otherwise, right?\n\n1:20:51.420 --> 1:20:52.740\n I should have done otherwise, right?\n\n1:20:52.740 --> 1:20:55.420\n Like if you think about something\n\n1:20:55.420 --> 1:20:57.660\n that you deeply regret doing, right?\n\n1:20:57.660 --> 1:21:00.860\n Or that you hold someone else responsible for\n\n1:21:00.860 --> 1:21:03.300\n because they really are the upstream agent\n\n1:21:03.300 --> 1:21:05.640\n in your mind of what they did.\n\n1:21:05.640 --> 1:21:08.140\n You know, that's an awful thing that that person did\n\n1:21:08.140 --> 1:21:09.700\n and they shouldn't have done it.\n\n1:21:09.700 --> 1:21:12.940\n So there is this illusion and it has to be an illusion\n\n1:21:12.940 --> 1:21:17.100\n because there's no picture of causation\n\n1:21:17.100 --> 1:21:18.940\n that would make sense of it.\n\n1:21:18.940 --> 1:21:21.900\n There's this illusion that if you arrange the universe\n\n1:21:21.900 --> 1:21:24.440\n exactly the way it was a moment ago,\n\n1:21:24.440 --> 1:21:27.020\n it could have played out differently.\n\n1:21:27.020 --> 1:21:31.580\n And the only way it could have played out differently\n\n1:21:31.580 --> 1:21:34.820\n is if there's randomness added to that,\n\n1:21:34.820 --> 1:21:37.840\n but randomness isn't what people feel\n\n1:21:37.840 --> 1:21:39.380\n would give them free will, right?\n\n1:21:39.380 --> 1:21:41.140\n If you tell me that, you know,\n\n1:21:41.140 --> 1:21:43.980\n I only reached for the water bottle this time\n\n1:21:43.980 --> 1:21:47.060\n because there's a random number generator in there\n\n1:21:47.060 --> 1:21:51.220\n kicking off values and it finally moved my hand,\n\n1:21:51.220 --> 1:21:54.060\n that's not the feeling of authorship.\n\n1:21:54.060 --> 1:21:55.680\n That's still not control.\n\n1:21:55.680 --> 1:21:58.140\n You're still not making that decision.\n\n1:21:58.140 --> 1:22:00.560\n There's actually, I don't know if you're familiar\n\n1:22:00.560 --> 1:22:01.780\n with cellular automata.\n\n1:22:01.780 --> 1:22:03.580\n It's a really nice visualization\n\n1:22:03.580 --> 1:22:07.780\n of how simple rules can create incredible complexity\n\n1:22:07.780 --> 1:22:11.020\n that it's like really dumb initial conditions to set,\n\n1:22:11.020 --> 1:22:14.980\n simple rules applied, and eventually you watch this thing\n\n1:22:14.980 --> 1:22:18.660\n and if the initial conditions are correct,\n\n1:22:18.660 --> 1:22:21.380\n then you're going to have emerged something\n\n1:22:21.380 --> 1:22:23.200\n that to our perception system\n\n1:22:23.200 --> 1:22:25.460\n looks like organisms interacting.\n\n1:22:25.460 --> 1:22:27.120\n You can construct any kinds of worlds\n\n1:22:27.120 --> 1:22:29.780\n and they're not actually interacting.\n\n1:22:29.780 --> 1:22:31.980\n They're not actually even organisms.\n\n1:22:31.980 --> 1:22:34.940\n And they certainly aren't making decisions.\n\n1:22:34.940 --> 1:22:37.120\n So there's like systems you can create\n\n1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:38.580\n that illustrate this point.\n\n1:22:38.580 --> 1:22:42.840\n The question is whether there could be some room\n\n1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:47.440\n for let's use in the 21st century the term magic,\n\n1:22:47.440 --> 1:22:50.220\n back to the black box of consciousness.\n\n1:22:50.220 --> 1:22:51.860\n Let me ask it this way.\n\n1:22:51.860 --> 1:22:56.360\n If you're wrong about your intuition about free will,\n\n1:22:56.360 --> 1:22:58.420\n what, and somebody comes along to you\n\n1:22:58.420 --> 1:23:03.300\n and proves to you that you didn't have the full picture,\n\n1:23:03.300 --> 1:23:04.900\n what would that proof look like?\n\n1:23:04.900 --> 1:23:05.740\n What would?\n\n1:23:05.740 --> 1:23:08.660\n So that's the problem, that's why it's not even an illusion\n\n1:23:08.660 --> 1:23:13.660\n in my world because for me, it's impossible to say\n\n1:23:14.500 --> 1:23:16.860\n what the universe would have to be like\n\n1:23:16.860 --> 1:23:19.220\n for free will to be a thing, right?\n\n1:23:19.220 --> 1:23:22.500\n It doesn't conceptually map onto any notion\n\n1:23:22.500 --> 1:23:24.740\n of causation we have.\n\n1:23:24.740 --> 1:23:29.440\n And that's unlike any other spurious claim you might make.\n\n1:23:29.440 --> 1:23:33.760\n So like if you're gonna believe in ghosts, right?\n\n1:23:33.760 --> 1:23:37.900\n I understand what that claim could be,\n\n1:23:37.900 --> 1:23:40.180\n where like I don't happen to believe in ghosts,\n\n1:23:40.180 --> 1:23:44.300\n but it's not hard for me to specify\n\n1:23:44.300 --> 1:23:47.340\n what would have to be true for ghosts to be real.\n\n1:23:47.340 --> 1:23:50.060\n And so it is with a thousand other things like ghosts,\n\n1:23:50.060 --> 1:23:52.020\n right, so like, okay, so you're telling me\n\n1:23:52.020 --> 1:23:54.820\n that when people die, there's some part of them\n\n1:23:54.820 --> 1:23:57.460\n that is not reducible at all to their biology\n\n1:23:57.460 --> 1:24:00.620\n that lifts off them and goes elsewhere\n\n1:24:00.620 --> 1:24:02.180\n and is actually the kind of thing\n\n1:24:02.180 --> 1:24:04.660\n that they can linger in closets and in cupboards\n\n1:24:04.660 --> 1:24:07.620\n and actually it's immaterial,\n\n1:24:07.620 --> 1:24:09.200\n but by some principle of physics,\n\n1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:11.600\n we don't totally understand it can make sounds\n\n1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:15.820\n and knock objects and even occasionally show up\n\n1:24:15.820 --> 1:24:17.480\n so they can be visually beheld.\n\n1:24:18.900 --> 1:24:21.700\n And it's just, it seems like a miracle,\n\n1:24:21.700 --> 1:24:25.580\n but it's just some spooky noun in the universe\n\n1:24:25.580 --> 1:24:28.200\n that we don't understand, let's call it a ghost.\n\n1:24:29.460 --> 1:24:31.940\n That's fine, I can talk about that all day.\n\n1:24:31.940 --> 1:24:32.980\n The reasons to believe in it,\n\n1:24:32.980 --> 1:24:34.160\n the reasons not to believe in it,\n\n1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:36.340\n the way we would scientifically test for it,\n\n1:24:36.340 --> 1:24:38.180\n what would have to be provable\n\n1:24:38.180 --> 1:24:40.920\n so as to convince me that ghosts are real.\n\n1:24:42.580 --> 1:24:44.260\n Free will isn't like that at all.\n\n1:24:44.260 --> 1:24:49.260\n There's no description of any concatenation of causes\n\n1:24:49.320 --> 1:24:52.140\n that precedes my conscious experience\n\n1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.340\n that sounds like what people think they have\n\n1:24:55.340 --> 1:24:56.980\n when they think they could have done otherwise\n\n1:24:56.980 --> 1:25:00.180\n and that they really, that they, the conscious agent,\n\n1:25:00.180 --> 1:25:01.900\n is really in charge, right?\n\n1:25:01.900 --> 1:25:05.040\n Like if you don't know what you're going to think next,\n\n1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:07.460\n right, and you can't help but think it,\n\n1:25:09.700 --> 1:25:12.860\n take those two premises on board.\n\n1:25:12.860 --> 1:25:14.780\n You don't know what it's gonna be,\n\n1:25:14.780 --> 1:25:18.240\n you can't stop it from coming,\n\n1:25:18.240 --> 1:25:21.820\n and until you actually know how to meditate,\n\n1:25:21.820 --> 1:25:24.680\n you can't stop yourself from\n\n1:25:27.020 --> 1:25:31.240\n fully living out its behavioral or emotional consequences.\n\n1:25:31.240 --> 1:25:33.020\n Right, like you have no, once you,\n\n1:25:33.020 --> 1:25:35.060\n mindfulness, you know,\n\n1:25:35.060 --> 1:25:38.420\n arguably gives you another degree of freedom here.\n\n1:25:38.420 --> 1:25:39.320\n It doesn't give you free will,\n\n1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:41.160\n but it gives you some other game to play\n\n1:25:41.160 --> 1:25:43.820\n with respect to the emotional\n\n1:25:43.820 --> 1:25:46.260\n and behavioral imperatives of thoughts.\n\n1:25:46.260 --> 1:25:50.420\n But short of that, I mean,\n\n1:25:50.420 --> 1:25:52.220\n the reason why mindfulness doesn't give you free will\n\n1:25:52.220 --> 1:25:53.620\n is because you can't, you know,\n\n1:25:53.620 --> 1:25:55.600\n you can't account for why in one moment\n\n1:25:55.600 --> 1:26:00.060\n mindfulness arises and in other moments it doesn't, right?\n\n1:26:00.060 --> 1:26:03.500\n But a different process is initiated\n\n1:26:03.500 --> 1:26:06.820\n once you can practice in that way.\n\n1:26:06.820 --> 1:26:08.860\n Well, if I could push back for a second.\n\n1:26:08.860 --> 1:26:11.120\n By the way, I just have this thought bubble\n\n1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:14.100\n popping up all the time of just two recent chimps\n\n1:26:14.100 --> 1:26:16.740\n arguing about the nature of consciousness.\n\n1:26:16.740 --> 1:26:17.860\n It's kind of hilarious.\n\n1:26:17.860 --> 1:26:20.500\n So on that thread, you know,\n\n1:26:21.420 --> 1:26:22.900\n if we're, even before Einstein,\n\n1:26:22.900 --> 1:26:24.340\n let's say before Einstein,\n\n1:26:24.340 --> 1:26:27.060\n we were to conceive about traveling\n\n1:26:27.060 --> 1:26:32.060\n from point A to point B, say some point in the future,\n\n1:26:32.420 --> 1:26:34.940\n we are able to realize through engineering\n\n1:26:34.940 --> 1:26:39.380\n a way which is consistent with Einstein's theory\n\n1:26:39.380 --> 1:26:40.380\n that you can have wormholes.\n\n1:26:40.380 --> 1:26:42.780\n You can travel from one point to another\n\n1:26:42.780 --> 1:26:44.420\n faster than the speed of light.\n\n1:26:46.260 --> 1:26:49.480\n And that would, I think, completely change our conception\n\n1:26:49.480 --> 1:26:52.900\n of what it means to travel in the physical space.\n\n1:26:52.900 --> 1:26:57.420\n And that completely transform our ability.\n\n1:26:57.420 --> 1:26:59.780\n You talk about causality, but here let's just focus\n\n1:26:59.780 --> 1:27:03.400\n on what it means to travel through physical space.\n\n1:27:03.400 --> 1:27:08.160\n Don't you think it's possible that there will be inventions\n\n1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:11.300\n or leaps in understanding about reality\n\n1:27:11.300 --> 1:27:15.980\n that will allow us to see free will as actually,\n\n1:27:15.980 --> 1:27:19.340\n like us humans somehow may be linked\n\n1:27:19.340 --> 1:27:21.380\n to this idea of consciousness,\n\n1:27:21.380 --> 1:27:24.500\n are actually able to be authors of our actions?\n\n1:27:25.580 --> 1:27:29.500\n It is a nonstarter for me conceptually.\n\n1:27:29.500 --> 1:27:30.940\n It's a little bit like saying,\n\n1:27:33.060 --> 1:27:35.920\n could there be some breakthrough that will cause us\n\n1:27:35.920 --> 1:27:40.180\n to realize that circles are really square\n\n1:27:40.180 --> 1:27:43.040\n or the circles are not really round, right?\n\n1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:47.860\n No, a circle is what we mean by a perfectly round form.\n\n1:27:47.860 --> 1:27:52.460\n It's not on the table to be revised.\n\n1:27:52.460 --> 1:27:55.060\n And so I would say the same thing about consciousness.\n\n1:27:55.060 --> 1:27:58.940\n It's just like saying, is there some breakthrough\n\n1:27:58.940 --> 1:28:00.980\n that would get us to realize that consciousness\n\n1:28:00.980 --> 1:28:02.660\n is really an illusion?\n\n1:28:02.660 --> 1:28:06.540\n I'm saying no, because the experience of an illusion\n\n1:28:06.540 --> 1:28:09.020\n is as much a demonstration of what I'm calling consciousness\n\n1:28:09.020 --> 1:28:10.380\n as anything else, right?\n\n1:28:10.380 --> 1:28:11.420\n That is consciousness.\n\n1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:15.340\n With free will, it's a similar problem.\n\n1:28:15.340 --> 1:28:20.340\n It's like, again, it comes down to a picture of causality\n\n1:28:22.620 --> 1:28:27.020\n and there's no other picture on offer.\n\n1:28:27.020 --> 1:28:31.700\n And what's more, I know what it's like\n\n1:28:31.700 --> 1:28:36.540\n on the experiential side to lose the thing\n\n1:28:36.540 --> 1:28:39.060\n to which it is clearly anchored, right?\n\n1:28:39.060 --> 1:28:41.660\n Like the feel, like it doesn't feel,\n\n1:28:41.660 --> 1:28:43.740\n and this is the question that almost nobody asked.\n\n1:28:43.740 --> 1:28:46.520\n People who are debating me on the topic of free will,\n\n1:28:47.860 --> 1:28:51.980\n I'm, at 15 minute intervals, I'm making a claim\n\n1:28:51.980 --> 1:28:53.500\n that I don't feel this thing,\n\n1:28:53.500 --> 1:28:58.220\n and they never become interested in,\n\n1:28:58.220 --> 1:28:59.220\n well, what's that like?\n\n1:28:59.220 --> 1:29:02.100\n Like, okay, so you're actually saying you don't,\n\n1:29:02.100 --> 1:29:05.880\n this thing isn't true for you empirically.\n\n1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:07.280\n It's not just, because most people\n\n1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:11.140\n who don't believe in free will philosophically\n\n1:29:11.140 --> 1:29:15.120\n also believe that we're condemned to experience it.\n\n1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:19.080\n Like, you just, you can't live without this feeling, so.\n\n1:29:19.080 --> 1:29:21.240\n So you're actually saying you're able\n\n1:29:21.240 --> 1:29:26.240\n to experience the absence of the illusion of free will?\n\n1:29:27.040 --> 1:29:28.040\n Yes, yes.\n\n1:29:28.040 --> 1:29:32.600\n For, are we talking about a few minutes at a time,\n\n1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:37.600\n or is this, does it require a lot of work, a meditation,\n\n1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:41.120\n or are you literally able to load that into your mind\n\n1:29:41.120 --> 1:29:42.080\n and like play that moment?\n\n1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:44.640\n Right now, right now, just in this conversation.\n\n1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:48.180\n So it's not absolutely continuous,\n\n1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:51.580\n but it's whenever I pay attention.\n\n1:29:51.580 --> 1:29:53.800\n It's like, and I would say the same thing\n\n1:29:53.800 --> 1:29:56.760\n for the illusoriness of the self in the sense,\n\n1:29:56.760 --> 1:29:58.920\n and again, we haven't talked about this, so.\n\n1:29:58.920 --> 1:30:01.640\n Can you still have the self and not have the free will\n\n1:30:01.640 --> 1:30:02.480\n in mind at the same time?\n\n1:30:02.480 --> 1:30:03.920\n Do they go at the same time?\n\n1:30:03.920 --> 1:30:06.520\n This is the same, yeah, it's the same thing.\n\n1:30:06.520 --> 1:30:08.760\n They're always holding hands when they walk out the door.\n\n1:30:08.760 --> 1:30:10.600\n There really are two sides at the same coin.\n\n1:30:10.600 --> 1:30:13.320\n But it's just, it comes down to what it's like\n\n1:30:14.240 --> 1:30:16.520\n to try to get to the end of this sentence,\n\n1:30:16.520 --> 1:30:18.920\n or what it's like to finally decide\n\n1:30:18.920 --> 1:30:20.400\n that it's been long enough\n\n1:30:20.400 --> 1:30:22.160\n and now I need another sip of water, right?\n\n1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:25.860\n If I'm paying attention, now, if I'm not paying attention,\n\n1:30:25.860 --> 1:30:28.720\n I'm probably, I'm captured by some other thought\n\n1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:30.720\n and that feels a certain way, right?\n\n1:30:30.720 --> 1:30:32.280\n And so that's not, it's not vivid,\n\n1:30:32.280 --> 1:30:35.540\n but if I try to make vivid this experience of just,\n\n1:30:35.540 --> 1:30:38.240\n okay, I'm finally gonna experience free will.\n\n1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:40.440\n I'm gonna notice my free will, right?\n\n1:30:40.440 --> 1:30:43.240\n Like it's gotta be here, everyone's talking about it.\n\n1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:44.080\n Where is it?\n\n1:30:44.080 --> 1:30:45.760\n I'm gonna pay attention to, I'm gonna look for it.\n\n1:30:45.760 --> 1:30:48.600\n And I'm gonna create a circumstance\n\n1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:52.200\n that is where it has to be most robust, right?\n\n1:30:52.200 --> 1:30:54.660\n I'm not rushed to make this decision.\n\n1:30:54.660 --> 1:30:57.060\n I'm not, it's not a reflex.\n\n1:30:57.060 --> 1:30:58.640\n I'm not under pressure.\n\n1:30:58.640 --> 1:30:59.940\n I'm gonna take as long as I want.\n\n1:30:59.940 --> 1:31:02.960\n I'm going to decide, it's not trivial.\n\n1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:04.760\n Like, so it's not just like reaching with my left hand\n\n1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:05.680\n or reaching with my right hand.\n\n1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:07.720\n People don't like those examples for some reason.\n\n1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:09.240\n Let's make a big decision.\n\n1:31:09.240 --> 1:31:14.240\n Like, where should, what should my next podcast be on, right?\n\n1:31:16.340 --> 1:31:18.560\n Who do I invite on the next podcast?\n\n1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:20.600\n What is it like to make that decision?\n\n1:31:20.600 --> 1:31:22.800\n When I pay attention,\n\n1:31:22.800 --> 1:31:26.680\n there is no evidence of free will anywhere in sight.\n\n1:31:26.680 --> 1:31:28.160\n It's like, it doesn't feel like,\n\n1:31:28.160 --> 1:31:31.200\n it feels profoundly mysterious\n\n1:31:31.200 --> 1:31:33.920\n to be going back between two people.\n\n1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:37.600\n Like, is it gonna be person A or person B?\n\n1:31:37.600 --> 1:31:40.240\n Got all my reasons for A and all my reasons why not\n\n1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:41.240\n and all my reasons for B.\n\n1:31:41.240 --> 1:31:43.960\n And there's some math going on there\n\n1:31:43.960 --> 1:31:46.440\n that I'm not even privy to\n\n1:31:46.440 --> 1:31:49.380\n where certain concerns are trumping others.\n\n1:31:49.380 --> 1:31:52.880\n And at a certain point, I just decide.\n\n1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:56.020\n And yes, you can say I'm the node in the network\n\n1:31:56.020 --> 1:31:57.560\n that has made that decision, absolutely.\n\n1:31:57.560 --> 1:32:00.360\n I'm not saying it's being piped to me from elsewhere,\n\n1:32:00.360 --> 1:32:04.560\n but the feeling of what it's like to make that decision\n\n1:32:04.560 --> 1:32:09.560\n is totally without a sense,\n\n1:32:11.280 --> 1:32:15.080\n a real sense of agency\n\n1:32:15.080 --> 1:32:18.720\n because something simply emerges.\n\n1:32:18.720 --> 1:32:22.400\n It's literally as tenuous as\n\n1:32:22.400 --> 1:32:26.020\n what's the next sound I'm going to hear, right?\n\n1:32:26.020 --> 1:32:29.440\n Or what's the next thought that's gonna appear?\n\n1:32:29.440 --> 1:32:32.320\n And it just, something just appears, you know?\n\n1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:34.680\n And if something appears to cancel that something,\n\n1:32:34.680 --> 1:32:37.760\n like if I say, I'm gonna invite her\n\n1:32:37.760 --> 1:32:39.360\n and then I'm about to send the email\n\n1:32:39.360 --> 1:32:42.560\n and then I think, oh, no, no, no, I can't do that.\n\n1:32:42.560 --> 1:32:45.240\n There was a thing in that New York article I read\n\n1:32:45.240 --> 1:32:47.700\n that I gotta talk to this guy, right?\n\n1:32:47.700 --> 1:32:49.740\n That pivot at the last second,\n\n1:32:49.740 --> 1:32:53.960\n you can make it as muscular as you want.\n\n1:32:53.960 --> 1:32:56.000\n It always just comes out of the darkness.\n\n1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:57.800\n It's always mysterious.\n\n1:32:57.800 --> 1:32:59.440\n So right, when you try to pin it down,\n\n1:32:59.440 --> 1:33:02.000\n you really can't ever find that free will.\n\n1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:06.160\n If you construct an experiment for yourself\n\n1:33:06.160 --> 1:33:07.920\n and you're trying to really find that moment\n\n1:33:07.920 --> 1:33:11.760\n when you're actually making that controlled author decision,\n\n1:33:11.760 --> 1:33:12.800\n it's very difficult to do.\n\n1:33:12.800 --> 1:33:15.920\n And we're still, we're still, we know at this point\n\n1:33:15.920 --> 1:33:18.280\n that if we were scanning your brain\n\n1:33:18.280 --> 1:33:23.280\n in some podcast guest choosing experiment, right?\n\n1:33:24.120 --> 1:33:27.040\n We know at this point we would be privy\n\n1:33:27.040 --> 1:33:29.520\n to who you're going to pick before you are,\n\n1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:30.800\n you the conscious agent.\n\n1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:33.120\n If we could, again, this is operationally\n\n1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:34.280\n a little hard to conduct,\n\n1:33:34.280 --> 1:33:36.880\n but there's enough data now to know\n\n1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:41.440\n that something very much like this cartoon is in fact true\n\n1:33:42.800 --> 1:33:45.260\n and will ultimately be undeniable for people.\n\n1:33:46.120 --> 1:33:49.480\n They'll be able to do it on themselves with some app.\n\n1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:54.680\n If you're deciding what to, you know,\n\n1:33:54.680 --> 1:33:56.840\n where to go for dinner or who to have on your podcast\n\n1:33:56.840 --> 1:33:58.840\n or ultimately, you know, who to marry, right?\n\n1:33:58.840 --> 1:34:00.960\n Or what city to move to, right?\n\n1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:02.800\n Like you can make it as big\n\n1:34:02.800 --> 1:34:04.600\n or as small a decision as you want.\n\n1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:08.000\n We could be scanning your brain in real time\n\n1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:12.580\n and at a point where you still think you're uncommitted,\n\n1:34:12.580 --> 1:34:17.080\n we would be able to say with arbitrary accuracy,\n\n1:34:17.080 --> 1:34:20.840\n all right, Lex is, he's moving to Austin, right?\n\n1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:21.680\n I didn't choose that.\n\n1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:23.800\n Yeah, he was choosing, it was gonna be Austin\n\n1:34:23.800 --> 1:34:24.800\n or it was gonna be Miami.\n\n1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:27.760\n He got, he's catching one of these two waves,\n\n1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:29.240\n but it's gonna be Austin.\n\n1:34:29.240 --> 1:34:31.800\n And at a point where you subjectively,\n\n1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:34.200\n if we could ask you, you would say,\n\n1:34:34.200 --> 1:34:36.940\n oh no, I'm still working over here.\n\n1:34:36.940 --> 1:34:40.720\n I'm still thinking, I'm still considering my options.\n\n1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:43.040\n And you've spoken to this,\n\n1:34:43.040 --> 1:34:45.520\n in you thinking about other stuff in the world,\n\n1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:49.920\n it's been very useful to step away\n\n1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:51.480\n from this illusion of free will.\n\n1:34:51.480 --> 1:34:54.140\n And you argue that it's probably makes a better world\n\n1:34:54.140 --> 1:34:55.400\n because it can be compassionate\n\n1:34:55.400 --> 1:34:56.880\n and empathetic towards others.\n\n1:34:56.880 --> 1:34:58.380\n And towards oneself.\n\n1:34:58.380 --> 1:34:59.220\n Towards oneself.\n\n1:34:59.220 --> 1:35:01.880\n I mean, radically toward others\n\n1:35:01.880 --> 1:35:05.780\n in that literally hate makes no sense anymore.\n\n1:35:05.780 --> 1:35:06.800\n I mean, there are certain things\n\n1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:10.920\n you can really be worried about, really want to oppose.\n\n1:35:10.920 --> 1:35:12.000\n Really, I mean, I'm not saying\n\n1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:13.800\n you'd never have to kill another person.\n\n1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:16.380\n Like, I mean, self defense is still a thing, right?\n\n1:35:16.380 --> 1:35:21.380\n But the idea that you're ever confronting anything\n\n1:35:22.180 --> 1:35:25.560\n other than a force of nature in the end\n\n1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:26.740\n goes out the window, right?\n\n1:35:26.740 --> 1:35:29.040\n Or does go out the window when you really pay attention.\n\n1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:33.400\n I'm not saying that this would be easy to grok\n\n1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:38.340\n if someone kills a member of your family.\n\n1:35:38.340 --> 1:35:39.560\n I'm not saying you can just listen\n\n1:35:39.560 --> 1:35:40.880\n to my 90 minutes on free will\n\n1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:42.360\n and then you should be able to see that person\n\n1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:46.560\n as identical to a grizzly bear or a virus.\n\n1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:49.740\n Because there's so, I mean, we are so evolved\n\n1:35:49.740 --> 1:35:54.740\n to deal with one another as fellow primates\n\n1:35:54.740 --> 1:35:59.740\n and as agents, but it's, yeah,\n\n1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:01.960\n when you're talking about the possibility\n\n1:36:01.960 --> 1:36:05.800\n of, you know, Christian, you know,\n\n1:36:05.800 --> 1:36:08.280\n truly Christian forgiveness, right?\n\n1:36:08.280 --> 1:36:13.280\n It's like, you know, as testified to by, you know,\n\n1:36:14.080 --> 1:36:19.080\n various saints of that flavor over the millennia.\n\n1:36:19.080 --> 1:36:24.080\n Yeah, that is, the doorway to that is to recognize\n\n1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:28.080\n that no one really at bottom made themselves.\n\n1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:31.560\n And therefore everyone, what we're seeing really\n\n1:36:31.560 --> 1:36:34.440\n are differences in luck in the world.\n\n1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:37.160\n We're seeing people who are very, very lucky\n\n1:36:37.160 --> 1:36:38.880\n to have had good parents and good genes\n\n1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:41.480\n and to be in good societies and had good opportunities\n\n1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:44.080\n and to be intelligent and to be, you know,\n\n1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:47.080\n not as intelligent as they were in the past.\n\n1:36:47.080 --> 1:36:50.000\n And to be, you know, not sociopathic,\n\n1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:53.080\n like none of it is on them.\n\n1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:56.640\n They're just reaping the fruits of one lottery\n\n1:36:56.640 --> 1:36:59.200\n after another, and then showing up in the world\n\n1:36:59.200 --> 1:37:00.140\n on that basis.\n\n1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:04.160\n And then so it is with, you know,\n\n1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:06.480\n every malevolent asshole out there, right?\n\n1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:09.560\n He or she didn't make themself.\n\n1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:14.080\n Even if that weren't possible,\n\n1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:18.600\n the utility for self compassion is also enormous\n\n1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:21.760\n because it's, when you just look at what it's like\n\n1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:26.760\n to regret something or to feel shame about something\n\n1:37:27.520 --> 1:37:30.160\n or feel deep embarrassment, these states of mind\n\n1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:34.640\n are some of the most deranging experiences anyone has.\n\n1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:39.640\n And the indelible reaction to them,\n\n1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:41.960\n you know, the memory of the thing you said,\n\n1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:44.040\n you know, the memory of the wedding toast you gave\n\n1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:47.120\n 20 years ago that was just mortifying, right?\n\n1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:50.280\n The fact that that can still make you hate yourself, right?\n\n1:37:50.280 --> 1:37:52.360\n And like that psychologically,\n\n1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:56.280\n that is a knot that can be untied, right?\n\n1:37:56.280 --> 1:37:57.340\n Speak for yourself, Sam.\n\n1:37:57.340 --> 1:37:58.180\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:37:58.180 --> 1:37:59.000\n So clearly you're not.\n\n1:37:59.000 --> 1:37:59.840\n You gave a great toast.\n\n1:37:59.840 --> 1:38:01.160\n It was my toast that mortified me.\n\n1:38:01.160 --> 1:38:02.880\n No, no, that's not what I was referring to.\n\n1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:07.320\n I'm deeply appreciative in the same way\n\n1:38:07.320 --> 1:38:10.360\n that you're referring to of every moment I'm alive,\n\n1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:14.360\n but I'm also powered by self hate often.\n\n1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:18.080\n Like several things in this conversation already\n\n1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:21.080\n that I've spoken, I'll be thinking about,\n\n1:38:21.080 --> 1:38:23.080\n like that was the dumbest thing.\n\n1:38:23.080 --> 1:38:26.260\n You're sitting in front of Sam Harris and you said that.\n\n1:38:26.260 --> 1:38:29.300\n So like that, but that somehow creates\n\n1:38:29.300 --> 1:38:30.640\n a richer experience for me.\n\n1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:33.360\n Like I've actually come to accept that as a nice feature\n\n1:38:33.360 --> 1:38:35.360\n however my brain was built.\n\n1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:37.340\n I don't think I want to let go of that.\n\n1:38:37.340 --> 1:38:39.520\n Well, the thing you, I think the thing you want to let go of\n\n1:38:39.520 --> 1:38:44.520\n is the suffering associated with it.\n\n1:38:46.400 --> 1:38:51.400\n So like, so for me, so psychologically and ethically,\n\n1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:55.240\n all of this is very interesting.\n\n1:38:55.240 --> 1:38:56.560\n So I don't think we ever,\n\n1:38:56.560 --> 1:38:59.500\n we should ever get rid of things like anger, right?\n\n1:38:59.500 --> 1:39:02.720\n So like hatred is, hatred is divorcible from anger\n\n1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:07.720\n in the sense that hatred is this enduring state where,\n\n1:39:07.920 --> 1:39:09.100\n you know, whether you're hating somebody else\n\n1:39:09.100 --> 1:39:11.480\n or hating yourself, it is just,\n\n1:39:11.480 --> 1:39:15.900\n it is toxic and durable and ultimately useless, right?\n\n1:39:15.900 --> 1:39:19.520\n Like it becomes, it becomes self nullifying, right?\n\n1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:23.280\n Like you become less capable as a person\n\n1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:24.480\n to solve any of your problems.\n\n1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:26.680\n It's not, it's not instrumental in solving the problem\n\n1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:29.920\n that is, that is, is occasioning all this hatred.\n\n1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:34.200\n And anger for the most part isn't either except\n\n1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:37.280\n as a signal of salience that there's a problem, right?\n\n1:39:37.280 --> 1:39:40.280\n So if somebody does something that makes me angry,\n\n1:39:40.280 --> 1:39:44.280\n that just promotes this situation to conscious,\n\n1:39:44.280 --> 1:39:46.960\n conscious attention in a way that is stronger\n\n1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:49.480\n than my not really caring about it, right?\n\n1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:51.440\n And there are things that I think should make us angry\n\n1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:54.520\n in the world and there's the behavior of other people\n\n1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:57.460\n that should make us angry because we should respond to it.\n\n1:39:57.460 --> 1:39:59.120\n And so it is with yourself.\n\n1:39:59.120 --> 1:40:01.840\n If I do something, you know, as a parent,\n\n1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:05.280\n if I do something stupid that harms one of my daughters,\n\n1:40:05.280 --> 1:40:10.280\n right, my belief, my experience of myself\n\n1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:14.400\n and my beliefs about free will close the door to my saying,\n\n1:40:14.400 --> 1:40:16.280\n well, I should have done otherwise in the sense\n\n1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:17.660\n that if I could go back in time,\n\n1:40:17.660 --> 1:40:20.360\n I would have actually effectively done otherwise.\n\n1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:22.840\n No, I would do, given the same causes and conditions,\n\n1:40:22.840 --> 1:40:26.320\n I would do that thing a trillion times in a row, right?\n\n1:40:26.320 --> 1:40:31.320\n But, you know, regret and feeling bad about an outcome\n\n1:40:31.320 --> 1:40:34.600\n are still important to capacities because like, yeah,\n\n1:40:34.600 --> 1:40:37.160\n you know, like I desperately want my daughters\n\n1:40:37.160 --> 1:40:38.720\n to be happy and healthy.\n\n1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:40.360\n So if I've done something, you know,\n\n1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:42.920\n if I crash the car when they're in the car\n\n1:40:42.920 --> 1:40:43.760\n and they get injured, right,\n\n1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:47.680\n and I do it because I was trying to change a song\n\n1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:50.600\n on my playlist or, you know, something stupid,\n\n1:40:50.600 --> 1:40:52.560\n I'm gonna feel like a total asshole.\n\n1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:58.720\n How long do I stew in that feeling of regret?\n\n1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:03.720\n Right, and to like, what utility is there to extract\n\n1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:05.520\n out of this error signal?\n\n1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:06.920\n And then what do I do?\n\n1:41:06.920 --> 1:41:10.480\n We're always faced with the question of what to do next,\n\n1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:13.520\n right, and how to best do that thing,\n\n1:41:13.520 --> 1:41:15.240\n that necessary thing next.\n\n1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:20.240\n And how much wellbeing can we experience while doing it?\n\n1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:27.360\n Like how miserable do you need to be to solve a problem\n\n1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:30.360\n in life and to help solve the problems\n\n1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:32.160\n of people closest to you?\n\n1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:33.920\n You know, how miserable do you need to be\n\n1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:36.880\n to get through your to do list today?\n\n1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:41.880\n Ultimately, I think you can be deeply happy\n\n1:41:44.840 --> 1:41:46.720\n going through all of it, right?\n\n1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:51.720\n And even navigating moments that are scary\n\n1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:56.720\n and, you know, really destabilizing to ordinary people.\n\n1:41:56.720 --> 1:42:01.720\n And, I mean, I think, you know, again,\n\n1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:05.560\n I'm always up kind of at the edge of my own capacities here\n\n1:42:05.560 --> 1:42:07.600\n and there are all kinds of things that stress me out\n\n1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:10.040\n and worry me and I'm especially something if it's,\n\n1:42:10.040 --> 1:42:11.400\n you're gonna tell me it's something with, you know,\n\n1:42:11.400 --> 1:42:14.000\n the health of one of my kids, you know,\n\n1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.600\n it's very hard for me, like, it's very hard for me\n\n1:42:16.600 --> 1:42:19.200\n to be truly equanimous around that.\n\n1:42:19.200 --> 1:42:22.120\n But equanimity is so useful\n\n1:42:23.080 --> 1:42:26.080\n the moment you're in response mode, right?\n\n1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:30.080\n Because, I mean, the ordinary experience for me\n\n1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:35.080\n of responding to what seems like a medical emergency\n\n1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:40.080\n for one of my kids is to be obviously super energized\n\n1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:44.360\n by concern to respond to that emergency.\n\n1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:47.240\n But then once I'm responding to that emergency,\n\n1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:50.200\n but then once I'm responding,\n\n1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:54.920\n all of my fear and agitation and worry and, oh my God,\n\n1:42:54.920 --> 1:42:58.120\n what if this is really something terrible?\n\n1:42:58.120 --> 1:43:01.880\n But finding any of those thoughts compelling,\n\n1:43:01.880 --> 1:43:05.480\n that only diminishes my capacity as a father\n\n1:43:05.480 --> 1:43:08.280\n to be good company while we navigate\n\n1:43:08.280 --> 1:43:11.440\n this really turbulent passage, you know?\n\n1:43:11.440 --> 1:43:12.480\n As you're saying this actually,\n\n1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:14.600\n one guy comes to mind, which is Elon Musk.\n\n1:43:14.600 --> 1:43:17.200\n One of the really impressive things to me\n\n1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:19.920\n was to observe how many dramatic things\n\n1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:22.400\n he has to deal with throughout the day at work,\n\n1:43:22.400 --> 1:43:26.600\n but also if you look through his life, family too,\n\n1:43:26.600 --> 1:43:30.440\n and how he's very much actually, as you're describing,\n\n1:43:30.440 --> 1:43:33.000\n basically a practitioner of this way of thought,\n\n1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:36.680\n which is you're not in control.\n\n1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:39.880\n You're basically responding\n\n1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:41.360\n no matter how traumatic the event,\n\n1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:43.880\n and there's no reason to sort of linger on the,\n\n1:43:44.880 --> 1:43:46.840\n on the negative feelings around that.\n\n1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:51.840\n Well, so, I mean, he, but he's in a very specific situation,\n\n1:43:52.080 --> 1:43:57.080\n which is unlike normal life,\n\n1:43:57.880 --> 1:43:59.080\n you know, even his normal life,\n\n1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:00.800\n but normal life for most people,\n\n1:44:00.800 --> 1:44:02.720\n because when you just think of like, you know,\n\n1:44:02.720 --> 1:44:04.080\n he's running so many businesses,\n\n1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:06.080\n and he's, they're very, they're not,\n\n1:44:06.080 --> 1:44:08.640\n they're non, highly nonstandard businesses.\n\n1:44:08.640 --> 1:44:12.440\n So what he's seen is everything that gets to him\n\n1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:13.880\n is some kind of emergency.\n\n1:44:13.880 --> 1:44:15.000\n Like it wouldn't be getting to him.\n\n1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:16.600\n If it needs his attention,\n\n1:44:16.600 --> 1:44:17.960\n there's a fire somewhere.\n\n1:44:17.960 --> 1:44:20.760\n So he's constantly responding to fires\n\n1:44:20.760 --> 1:44:22.720\n that have to be put out.\n\n1:44:22.720 --> 1:44:25.480\n So there's no default expectation\n\n1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:27.360\n that there shouldn't be a fire, right?\n\n1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:29.600\n But in our normal lives, we live,\n\n1:44:29.600 --> 1:44:31.720\n most of us, I mean, most of us who are lucky, right?\n\n1:44:31.720 --> 1:44:33.200\n Not everyone, obviously on earth,\n\n1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:36.600\n but most of us who are at some kind of cruising altitude\n\n1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:39.040\n in terms of our lives,\n\n1:44:39.040 --> 1:44:40.440\n where we're reasonably healthy,\n\n1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:42.120\n and life is reasonably orderly,\n\n1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:44.360\n and the political apparatus around us\n\n1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:47.440\n is reasonably functionable, functional,\n\n1:44:47.440 --> 1:44:48.280\n functionable.\n\n1:44:48.280 --> 1:44:50.160\n So I said, functionable for the first time in my life\n\n1:44:50.160 --> 1:44:51.360\n through no free will of my own.\n\n1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:53.080\n Say like, I noticed those errors,\n\n1:44:53.080 --> 1:44:56.240\n and they do not feel like agency,\n\n1:44:56.240 --> 1:44:59.800\n and nor does the success of an utterance feel like agency.\n\n1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:06.400\n He, when you're looking at normal human life, right,\n\n1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:10.360\n where you're just trying to be happy and healthy,\n\n1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:13.040\n and get your work done,\n\n1:45:13.040 --> 1:45:14.520\n there's this default expectation\n\n1:45:14.520 --> 1:45:16.400\n that there shouldn't be fires.\n\n1:45:16.400 --> 1:45:18.960\n People shouldn't be getting sick or injured.\n\n1:45:20.560 --> 1:45:23.720\n We shouldn't be losing vast amounts of our resources.\n\n1:45:23.720 --> 1:45:27.480\n We should, like, so when something really stark\n\n1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:28.760\n like that happens,\n\n1:45:31.520 --> 1:45:34.800\n people don't have a, people don't have that muscle\n\n1:45:34.800 --> 1:45:37.560\n that they're, like, I've been responding to emergencies\n\n1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:42.240\n all day long, seven days a week in business mode,\n\n1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:44.160\n and so I have a very thick skin.\n\n1:45:44.160 --> 1:45:45.680\n This is just another one.\n\n1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:47.320\n I'm not expecting anything else\n\n1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:48.720\n when I wake up in the morning.\n\n1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:50.880\n No, we have this default sense that,\n\n1:45:52.280 --> 1:45:54.440\n I mean, honestly, most of us have the default sense\n\n1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:57.120\n that we aren't gonna die, right,\n\n1:45:57.120 --> 1:45:59.680\n or that we should, like, maybe we're not gonna die.\n\n1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:02.960\n Right, like, death denial really is a thing.\n\n1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:06.360\n You know, we're, and you can see it,\n\n1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:09.840\n just like I can see when I reach for this bottle\n\n1:46:09.840 --> 1:46:11.600\n that I was expecting it to be solid,\n\n1:46:11.600 --> 1:46:13.640\n because when it isn't solid, when it's a hologram\n\n1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:16.720\n and I just, my fist closes on itself,\n\n1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:18.880\n I'm damn surprised.\n\n1:46:18.880 --> 1:46:22.120\n People are damn surprised to find out\n\n1:46:22.120 --> 1:46:24.680\n that they're going to die, to find out that they're sick,\n\n1:46:24.680 --> 1:46:27.640\n to find out that someone they love has died\n\n1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:28.640\n or is going to die.\n\n1:46:28.640 --> 1:46:32.520\n So it's like, the fact that we are surprised\n\n1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:36.360\n by any of that shows us that we're living at a,\n\n1:46:36.360 --> 1:46:41.360\n we're living in a mode that is, you know,\n\n1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:47.240\n we're perpetually diverting ourselves\n\n1:46:47.240 --> 1:46:50.520\n from some facts that should be obvious, right,\n\n1:46:50.520 --> 1:46:55.000\n and the more salient we can make them,\n\n1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:57.720\n you know, the more, I mean, in the case of death,\n\n1:46:57.720 --> 1:47:01.080\n it's a matter of being able to get one's priorities straight.\n\n1:47:01.080 --> 1:47:04.760\n I mean, the moment, again, this is hard for everybody,\n\n1:47:04.760 --> 1:47:06.600\n even those who are really in the business\n\n1:47:06.600 --> 1:47:07.480\n of paying attention to it,\n\n1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:12.360\n but the moment you realize that every circumstance\n\n1:47:12.360 --> 1:47:15.720\n is finite, right, you've got a certain number of,\n\n1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:17.120\n you know, you've got whatever, whatever it is,\n\n1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:20.720\n 8,000 days left in a normal span of life,\n\n1:47:21.880 --> 1:47:24.320\n and 8,000 is a, sounds like a big number,\n\n1:47:24.320 --> 1:47:25.760\n it's not that big a number, right,\n\n1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:29.480\n so it's just like, and then you can decide\n\n1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:31.600\n how you want to go through life\n\n1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:34.520\n and how you want to experience each one of those days,\n\n1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:37.640\n and so I was, back to our jumping off point,\n\n1:47:39.080 --> 1:47:44.080\n I would argue that you don't want to feel self hatred ever.\n\n1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:49.040\n I would argue that you don't want to really,\n\n1:47:53.240 --> 1:47:55.280\n really grasp onto any of those moments\n\n1:47:55.280 --> 1:47:58.880\n where you are internalizing the fact\n\n1:47:58.880 --> 1:48:01.440\n that you just made an error, you've embarrassed yourself,\n\n1:48:01.440 --> 1:48:03.760\n that something didn't go the way you wanted it to.\n\n1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:05.960\n I think you want to treat all of those moments\n\n1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:06.960\n very, very lightly.\n\n1:48:06.960 --> 1:48:10.800\n You want to extract the actionable information.\n\n1:48:10.800 --> 1:48:11.920\n It's something to learn.\n\n1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:16.920\n Oh, you know, I learned that when I prepare\n\n1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:18.440\n in a certain way, it works better\n\n1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:20.000\n than when I prepare in some other way,\n\n1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:22.320\n or don't prepare, right, like yes,\n\n1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:25.560\n lesson learned, you know, and do that differently,\n\n1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:34.560\n but yeah, I mean, so many of us have spent so much time\n\n1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:40.040\n with a very dysfunctional and hostile\n\n1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:46.080\n and even hateful inner voice\n\n1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:48.320\n governing a lot of our self talk\n\n1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:51.800\n and a lot of just our default way of being with ourselves.\n\n1:48:51.800 --> 1:48:54.160\n I mean, the privacy of our own minds,\n\n1:48:54.160 --> 1:48:58.080\n we're in the company of a real jerk a lot of the time,\n\n1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:03.080\n and that can't help but affect,\n\n1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:05.600\n I mean, forget about just your own sense of wellbeing.\n\n1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:08.560\n It can't help but limit what you're capable of\n\n1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:10.560\n in the world with other people.\n\n1:49:10.560 --> 1:49:12.120\n I'll have to really think about that.\n\n1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:15.080\n I just take pride that my jerk, my inner voice jerk\n\n1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:18.120\n is much less of a jerk than somebody like David Goggins,\n\n1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:20.120\n who's like screaming in his ear constantly.\n\n1:49:20.120 --> 1:49:23.160\n So I have a relativist kind of perspective\n\n1:49:23.160 --> 1:49:25.760\n that it's not as bad as that at least.\n\n1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:28.440\n Well, having a sense of humor also helps, you know,\n\n1:49:28.440 --> 1:49:29.480\n it's just like, it's not,\n\n1:49:29.480 --> 1:49:32.600\n the stakes are never quite what you think they are.\n\n1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:34.600\n And even when they are, I mean,\n\n1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:38.680\n it's just the difference between being able\n\n1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:41.000\n to see the comedy of it rather than,\n\n1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:44.520\n because again, there's this sort of dark star\n\n1:49:44.520 --> 1:49:49.120\n of self absorption that pulls everything into it, right?\n\n1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:54.120\n And that's the algorithm you don't want to run.\n\n1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.600\n So it's like, you just want things to be good.\n\n1:49:57.600 --> 1:50:01.000\n So like, just push the concern out there,\n\n1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:04.880\n like not have the collapse of,\n\n1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:06.640\n oh my God, what does this say about me?\n\n1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:08.760\n It's just like, what does this say about,\n\n1:50:08.760 --> 1:50:11.240\n how do we make this meal that we're all having together\n\n1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:15.640\n as fun and as useful as possible?\n\n1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:17.520\n And you're saying in terms of propulsion systems,\n\n1:50:17.520 --> 1:50:19.680\n you recommend humor is a good spaceship\n\n1:50:19.680 --> 1:50:23.680\n to escape the gravitational field of that darkness.\n\n1:50:23.680 --> 1:50:24.960\n Well, that certainly helps, yeah.\n\n1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:29.640\n Yeah, well, let me ask you a little bit about ego and fame,\n\n1:50:29.640 --> 1:50:33.400\n which is very interesting the way you're talking,\n\n1:50:33.400 --> 1:50:38.400\n given that you're one of the biggest intellects,\n\n1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:41.520\n living intellects and minds of our time.\n\n1:50:41.520 --> 1:50:44.360\n And there's a lot of people that really love you\n\n1:50:44.360 --> 1:50:49.360\n and almost elevate you to a certain kind of status\n\n1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:50.760\n where you're like the guru.\n\n1:50:50.760 --> 1:50:54.160\n I'm surprised you didn't show up in a robe, in fact.\n\n1:50:54.160 --> 1:50:55.200\n Is there a...\n\n1:50:55.200 --> 1:50:58.600\n A hoodie, isn't that the highest status garment\n\n1:50:58.600 --> 1:50:59.440\n one can wear now?\n\n1:50:59.440 --> 1:51:02.040\n The socially acceptable version of the robe.\n\n1:51:02.040 --> 1:51:04.640\n If you're a billionaire, you wear a hoodie.\n\n1:51:04.640 --> 1:51:07.200\n Is there something you can say about managing\n\n1:51:07.200 --> 1:51:11.480\n the effects of fame on your own mind,\n\n1:51:11.480 --> 1:51:14.600\n on not creating this, you know, when you wake up\n\n1:51:14.600 --> 1:51:18.080\n in the morning, when you look up in the mirror,\n\n1:51:18.080 --> 1:51:23.080\n how do you get your ego not to grow exponentially?\n\n1:51:24.240 --> 1:51:26.280\n Your conception of self to grow exponentially\n\n1:51:26.280 --> 1:51:28.760\n because there's so many people feeding that.\n\n1:51:28.760 --> 1:51:30.200\n Is there something to be said about this?\n\n1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:32.560\n It's really not hard because I mean,\n\n1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:36.240\n I feel like I have a pretty clear sense\n\n1:51:36.240 --> 1:51:39.880\n of my strengths and weaknesses.\n\n1:51:39.880 --> 1:51:42.600\n And I don't feel like it's...\n\n1:51:43.800 --> 1:51:45.840\n I mean, honestly, I don't feel like I suffer\n\n1:51:45.840 --> 1:51:48.560\n from much grandiosity.\n\n1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:51.040\n I mean, I just have a, you know,\n\n1:51:51.040 --> 1:51:52.640\n there's so many things I'm not good at.\n\n1:51:52.640 --> 1:51:53.920\n There's so many things I will, you know,\n\n1:51:53.920 --> 1:51:57.960\n given the remaining 8,000 days at best,\n\n1:51:57.960 --> 1:52:00.040\n I will never get good at.\n\n1:52:00.040 --> 1:52:02.560\n I would love to be good at these things.\n\n1:52:02.560 --> 1:52:05.280\n So it's just, it's easy to feel diminished\n\n1:52:05.280 --> 1:52:08.800\n by comparison with the talents of others.\n\n1:52:08.800 --> 1:52:11.160\n Do you remind yourself of all the things\n\n1:52:11.160 --> 1:52:14.560\n that you're not competent in?\n\n1:52:14.560 --> 1:52:15.400\n I mean, like what is...\n\n1:52:15.400 --> 1:52:17.080\n Well, they're just on display for me every day\n\n1:52:17.080 --> 1:52:19.320\n that I appreciate the talents of others.\n\n1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:20.280\n But you notice them.\n\n1:52:20.280 --> 1:52:22.880\n I'm sure Stalin and Hitler did not notice\n\n1:52:22.880 --> 1:52:25.280\n all the ways in which they were.\n\n1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:28.800\n I mean, this is why absolute power corrupts absolutely\n\n1:52:28.800 --> 1:52:30.800\n is you stop noticing the things\n\n1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:33.720\n in which you're ridiculous and wrong.\n\n1:52:33.720 --> 1:52:36.120\n Right, yeah, no, I am...\n\n1:52:36.120 --> 1:52:37.080\n Not to compare you to Stalin.\n\n1:52:37.080 --> 1:52:40.000\n Yeah, well, I'm sure there's an inner Stalin\n\n1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:41.280\n in there somewhere.\n\n1:52:41.280 --> 1:52:43.640\n Well, we all have, we all carry a baby Stalin with us.\n\n1:52:43.640 --> 1:52:44.840\n He wears better clothes.\n\n1:52:46.960 --> 1:52:49.080\n And I'm not gonna grow that mustache.\n\n1:52:49.080 --> 1:52:50.800\n Those concerns don't map,\n\n1:52:50.800 --> 1:52:53.480\n they don't map onto me for a bunch of reasons.\n\n1:52:53.480 --> 1:52:56.080\n But one is I also have a very peculiar audience.\n\n1:52:56.080 --> 1:52:59.800\n Like I'm just, you know,\n\n1:52:59.800 --> 1:53:01.440\n I've been appreciating this for a few years,\n\n1:53:01.440 --> 1:53:05.880\n but it's, I'm just now beginning to understand\n\n1:53:05.880 --> 1:53:07.680\n that there are many people who have audiences\n\n1:53:07.680 --> 1:53:11.560\n of my size or larger that have a very different experience\n\n1:53:11.560 --> 1:53:13.280\n of having an audience than I do.\n\n1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:18.280\n I have curated for better or worse, a peculiar audience.\n\n1:53:18.960 --> 1:53:23.960\n And the net result of that is virtually any time\n\n1:53:25.880 --> 1:53:28.240\n I say anything of substance,\n\n1:53:28.240 --> 1:53:30.600\n something like half of my audience,\n\n1:53:30.600 --> 1:53:33.080\n my real audience, not haters from outside my audience,\n\n1:53:33.080 --> 1:53:38.080\n but my audience is just revolts over it, right?\n\n1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:41.000\n They just like, oh my God, I can't believe you said it,\n\n1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:43.240\n like you're such a schmuck, right?\n\n1:53:43.240 --> 1:53:47.040\n They revolt with rigor and intellectual sophistication.\n\n1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:49.480\n Or not, or not, but I mean, it's both,\n\n1:53:49.480 --> 1:53:51.040\n but it's like, but people who are like,\n\n1:53:51.040 --> 1:53:53.280\n so it's, I mean, the clearest case is,\n\n1:53:53.280 --> 1:53:55.200\n you know, I have whatever audience I have\n\n1:53:55.200 --> 1:53:56.800\n and then Trump appears on the scene\n\n1:53:56.800 --> 1:54:00.600\n and I discovered that something like 20% of my audience\n\n1:54:00.600 --> 1:54:03.840\n just went straight to Trump and couldn't believe\n\n1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:05.120\n I didn't follow them there.\n\n1:54:05.120 --> 1:54:06.920\n They were just a gas that I didn't see\n\n1:54:06.920 --> 1:54:10.040\n that Trump was obviously exactly what we needed\n\n1:54:10.040 --> 1:54:15.000\n for, to steer the ship of state for the next four years\n\n1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:17.000\n and then four years beyond that.\n\n1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:20.400\n So like, so that's one example.\n\n1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:22.640\n So whenever I said anything about Trump,\n\n1:54:22.640 --> 1:54:25.760\n I would hear from people who loved more or less\n\n1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:28.920\n everything else I was up to and had for years,\n\n1:54:28.920 --> 1:54:33.400\n but everything I said about Trump just gave me pure pain\n\n1:54:33.400 --> 1:54:36.160\n from this quadrant of my audience.\n\n1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:39.560\n But then the same thing happens when I say something\n\n1:54:39.560 --> 1:54:42.000\n about the derangement of the far left.\n\n1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.200\n Anything I say about wokeness, right,\n\n1:54:44.200 --> 1:54:48.040\n or identity politics, same kind of punishment signal\n\n1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:51.760\n from, again, people who are core to my audience,\n\n1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:55.680\n like I've read all your books, I'm using your meditation app,\n\n1:54:55.680 --> 1:54:57.920\n I love what you say about science,\n\n1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:00.960\n but you are so wrong about politics and you are,\n\n1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:02.520\n I'm starting to think you're a racist asshole\n\n1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:05.120\n for everything you said about identity politics.\n\n1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:08.960\n And there are so many, the free will topic\n\n1:55:08.960 --> 1:55:12.040\n is just like this, it's like I just,\n\n1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:15.120\n they love what I'm saying about consciousness and the mind\n\n1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:18.280\n and they love to hear me talk about physics with physicists\n\n1:55:18.280 --> 1:55:21.600\n and it's all good, this free will stuff is,\n\n1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:24.440\n I cannot believe you don't see how wrong you are,\n\n1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:26.720\n what a fucking embarrassment you are.\n\n1:55:26.720 --> 1:55:30.320\n So, but I'm starting to notice that there are other people\n\n1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:33.440\n who don't have this experience of having an audience\n\n1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:37.320\n because they have, I mean, just take the Trump woke dichotomy.\n\n1:55:37.320 --> 1:55:41.640\n They just castigated Trump the same way I did,\n\n1:55:41.640 --> 1:55:44.160\n but they never say anything bad about the far left.\n\n1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:46.880\n So they never get this punishment signal or you flip it.\n\n1:55:46.880 --> 1:55:51.880\n They're all about the insanity of critical race theory now.\n\n1:55:51.880 --> 1:55:54.640\n We connect all those dots the same way,\n\n1:55:54.640 --> 1:55:58.320\n but they never really specified what was wrong with Trump\n\n1:55:58.320 --> 1:56:00.360\n or they thought there was a lot right with Trump\n\n1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:02.920\n and they got all the pleasure of that.\n\n1:56:02.920 --> 1:56:06.400\n And so they have much more homogenized audiences.\n\n1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:10.640\n And so my experience, so just to come back\n\n1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:13.360\n to this experience of fame or quasi fame,\n\n1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:16.680\n I mean, it's true, in truth, it's not real fame,\n\n1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:20.200\n but it's still, there's an audience there.\n\n1:56:20.200 --> 1:56:25.200\n It is a, it's now an experience where basically\n\n1:56:26.520 --> 1:56:30.040\n whatever I put out, I notice a ton of negativity\n\n1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:35.040\n coming back at me and it just, it is what it is.\n\n1:56:35.040 --> 1:56:37.680\n I mean, now, it's like, I used to think, wait a minute,\n\n1:56:37.680 --> 1:56:39.840\n there's gotta be some way for me to communicate\n\n1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:43.640\n more clearly here so as not to get this kind of\n\n1:56:45.360 --> 1:56:48.640\n lunatic response from my own audience.\n\n1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:51.480\n From like people who are showing all the signs of,\n\n1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:54.880\n we've been here for years for a reason, right?\n\n1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:56.840\n These are not just trolls.\n\n1:56:56.840 --> 1:56:59.680\n And so I think, okay, I'm gonna take 10 more minutes\n\n1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:04.200\n and really just tell you what should be absolutely clear\n\n1:57:04.200 --> 1:57:05.640\n about what's wrong with Trump, right?\n\n1:57:05.640 --> 1:57:07.160\n I've done this a few times,\n\n1:57:07.160 --> 1:57:09.240\n but I think I gotta do this again.\n\n1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:12.800\n Or wait a minute, how are they not getting\n\n1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:15.360\n that these episodes of police violence\n\n1:57:15.360 --> 1:57:17.880\n are so obviously different from the ones\n\n1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:20.120\n that you can't describe all of them\n\n1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:25.120\n to yet another racist maniac on the police force,\n\n1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:27.120\n killing someone based on his racism.\n\n1:57:29.120 --> 1:57:31.800\n Last time I spoke about this, it was pure pain,\n\n1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:33.920\n but I just gotta try again.\n\n1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:36.880\n Now at a certain point, I mean, I'm starting to feel like,\n\n1:57:36.880 --> 1:57:40.680\n all right, I just, I have to be, I have to cease.\n\n1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:43.160\n Again, it comes back to this expectation\n\n1:57:43.160 --> 1:57:45.040\n that there shouldn't be fires.\n\n1:57:45.040 --> 1:57:49.520\n I feel like if I could just play my game impeccably,\n\n1:57:49.520 --> 1:57:53.640\n the people who actually care what I think will follow me\n\n1:57:53.640 --> 1:57:58.640\n when I hit Trump and hit free will and hit the woke\n\n1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:00.400\n and hit whatever it is,\n\n1:58:00.400 --> 1:58:03.080\n how we should respond to the coronavirus, you know?\n\n1:58:03.080 --> 1:58:06.200\n I mean, vaccines, are they a thing, right?\n\n1:58:06.200 --> 1:58:10.640\n Like there's such derangement in our information space now\n\n1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:13.040\n that, I mean, I guess, you know,\n\n1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:15.160\n some people could be getting more of this than I expect,\n\n1:58:15.160 --> 1:58:18.560\n but I just noticed that many of our friends\n\n1:58:18.560 --> 1:58:22.560\n who are in the same game have more homogenized audiences\n\n1:58:22.560 --> 1:58:26.520\n and don't get, I mean, they've successfully filtered out\n\n1:58:26.520 --> 1:58:30.600\n the people who are gonna despise them on this next topic.\n\n1:58:30.600 --> 1:58:34.600\n And I would imagine you have a different experience\n\n1:58:34.600 --> 1:58:36.560\n of having a podcast than I do at this point.\n\n1:58:36.560 --> 1:58:38.800\n I mean, I'm sure you get haters,\n\n1:58:38.800 --> 1:58:43.560\n but I would imagine you're more streamlined.\n\n1:58:43.560 --> 1:58:45.360\n I actually don't like the word haters\n\n1:58:45.360 --> 1:58:50.360\n because it kinda presumes that it puts people in a bin.\n\n1:58:50.840 --> 1:58:54.200\n I think we're all have like baby haters inside of us\n\n1:58:54.200 --> 1:58:57.400\n and we just apply them and some people enjoy doing that\n\n1:58:57.400 --> 1:59:00.280\n more than others for particular periods of time.\n\n1:59:00.280 --> 1:59:03.200\n I think you're gonna almost see hating on the internet\n\n1:59:03.200 --> 1:59:05.720\n as a video game that you just play and it's fun,\n\n1:59:05.720 --> 1:59:07.400\n but then you can put it down and walk away\n\n1:59:07.400 --> 1:59:10.080\n and no, I certainly have a bunch of people\n\n1:59:10.080 --> 1:59:11.240\n that are very critical.\n\n1:59:11.240 --> 1:59:12.600\n I can list all the ways.\n\n1:59:12.600 --> 1:59:14.760\n But does it feel like on any given topic,\n\n1:59:14.760 --> 1:59:17.760\n does it feel like it's an actual title surge\n\n1:59:17.760 --> 1:59:19.880\n where it's like 30% of your audience\n\n1:59:19.880 --> 1:59:22.800\n and then the other 30% of your audience\n\n1:59:22.800 --> 1:59:24.040\n from podcast to podcast?\n\n1:59:24.040 --> 1:59:24.880\n No, no, no.\n\n1:59:24.880 --> 1:59:27.560\n That's happening to me all the time now.\n\n1:59:27.560 --> 1:59:30.240\n Well, I'm more with, I don't know what you think about this.\n\n1:59:30.240 --> 1:59:33.480\n I mean, Joe Rogan doesn't read comments\n\n1:59:33.480 --> 1:59:35.160\n or doesn't read comments much.\n\n1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:38.240\n And the argument he made to me is that\n\n1:59:40.240 --> 1:59:45.240\n he already has like a self critical person inside.\n\n1:59:46.600 --> 1:59:48.360\n And I'm gonna have to think about\n\n1:59:48.360 --> 1:59:49.520\n what you said in this conversation,\n\n1:59:49.520 --> 1:59:52.840\n but I have this very harshly self critical person\n\n1:59:52.840 --> 1:59:55.920\n inside as well where I don't need more fuel.\n\n1:59:55.920 --> 1:59:59.480\n I don't need, no, I do sometimes.\n\n1:59:59.480 --> 2:00:02.200\n That's why I check negativity occasionally,\n\n2:00:02.200 --> 2:00:03.720\n not too often.\n\n2:00:03.720 --> 2:00:06.160\n I sometimes need to like put a little bit more\n\n2:00:06.160 --> 2:00:09.760\n like coals into the fire, but not too much.\n\n2:00:09.760 --> 2:00:11.800\n But I already have that self critical engine\n\n2:00:11.800 --> 2:00:12.960\n that keeps me in check.\n\n2:00:12.960 --> 2:00:15.880\n I just, I wonder, you know, a lot of people\n\n2:00:15.880 --> 2:00:20.880\n who gain more and more fame lose that ability\n\n2:00:20.880 --> 2:00:21.880\n to be self critical.\n\n2:00:21.880 --> 2:00:23.760\n I guess because they lose the audience\n\n2:00:23.760 --> 2:00:25.360\n that can be critical towards them.\n\n2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:26.200\n Hmm.\n\n2:00:26.200 --> 2:00:28.960\n You know, I do follow Joe's advice much more\n\n2:00:28.960 --> 2:00:29.800\n than I ever have here.\n\n2:00:29.800 --> 2:00:32.120\n Like I don't look at comments very often.\n\n2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:36.600\n And I'm probably using Twitter, you know,\n\n2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:39.600\n 5% as much as I used to.\n\n2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:42.040\n I mean, I really just get in and out on Twitter\n\n2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:44.880\n and spend very little time in my ad mentions.\n\n2:00:46.880 --> 2:00:49.280\n I bet, you know, it does, in some ways it feels like a loss\n\n2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:50.320\n because occasionally I get,\n\n2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:52.960\n I see something super intelligent there.\n\n2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:55.360\n Like, I mean, I'll check my Twitter ad mentions\n\n2:00:55.360 --> 2:00:58.040\n and someone will have said, oh, have you read this article?\n\n2:00:58.040 --> 2:01:00.120\n And it's like, man, that was just,\n\n2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:03.080\n that was like the best article sent to me in a month, right?\n\n2:01:03.080 --> 2:01:04.720\n So it's like to have not have looked\n\n2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:08.040\n and to not have seen that, that's a loss.\n\n2:01:08.040 --> 2:01:13.040\n So, but it does, at this point, a little goes a long way.\n\n2:01:13.040 --> 2:01:18.040\n Cause I, yeah, it's not that it, for me now,\n\n2:01:19.040 --> 2:01:23.080\n I mean, this could sound like a fairly Stalinistic immunity\n\n2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:27.280\n to criticism, it's not so much that these voices of hate\n\n2:01:27.280 --> 2:01:31.280\n turn on my inner hater, you know, more,\n\n2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:33.400\n it's more that I just, I get a,\n\n2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:38.400\n what I fear is a false sense of humanity.\n\n2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:41.120\n Like, I feel like I'm too online\n\n2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:43.960\n and online is selecting for this performative outrage\n\n2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:46.520\n in everybody, everyone's signaling to an audience\n\n2:01:46.520 --> 2:01:48.400\n when they trash you.\n\n2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:52.400\n And I get a dark, I'm getting a, you know,\n\n2:01:52.400 --> 2:01:57.400\n a misanthropic, you know, cut of just what it's like\n\n2:01:58.680 --> 2:01:59.520\n out there.\n\n2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:02.120\n And it, cause when you meet people in real life,\n\n2:02:02.120 --> 2:02:04.640\n they're great, you know, they're all rather often great,\n\n2:02:04.640 --> 2:02:09.040\n you know, and it takes a lot to have anything\n\n2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:13.040\n like a Twitter encounter in real life with a living person.\n\n2:02:15.040 --> 2:02:19.040\n And that's, I think it's much better to have that\n\n2:02:19.040 --> 2:02:24.040\n as one's default sense of what it's like to be with people\n\n2:02:24.840 --> 2:02:28.040\n than what one gets on social media\n\n2:02:28.040 --> 2:02:30.440\n or on YouTube comment threads.\n\n2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:33.440\n You've produced a special episode with Rob Reed\n\n2:02:33.440 --> 2:02:38.160\n on your podcast recently on how bioengineering of viruses\n\n2:02:38.160 --> 2:02:40.400\n is going to destroy human civilization.\n\n2:02:40.400 --> 2:02:41.680\n So.\n\n2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:42.520\n Or could.\n\n2:02:42.520 --> 2:02:43.360\n Could.\n\n2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:44.200\n One fears, yeah.\n\n2:02:44.200 --> 2:02:45.280\n Sorry, the confidence there.\n\n2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:49.480\n But in the 21st century, what do you think,\n\n2:02:49.480 --> 2:02:53.640\n especially after having thought through that angle,\n\n2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:56.040\n what do you think is the biggest threat\n\n2:02:56.040 --> 2:02:58.720\n to the survival of the human species?\n\n2:03:00.880 --> 2:03:02.760\n I can give you the full menu if you'd like.\n\n2:03:02.760 --> 2:03:06.680\n Yeah, well, no, I would put the biggest threat\n\n2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:11.680\n at another level out, kind of the meta threat\n\n2:03:11.680 --> 2:03:16.680\n is our inability to agree about what the threats actually are\n\n2:03:19.040 --> 2:03:24.040\n and to converge on strategies for responding to them, right?\n\n2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:28.520\n So like I view COVID as, among other things,\n\n2:03:29.760 --> 2:03:34.760\n a truly terrifyingly failed dress rehearsal\n\n2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:37.160\n for something far worse, right?\n\n2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:41.520\n I mean, COVID is just about as benign as it could have been\n\n2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:44.600\n and still have been worse than the flu\n\n2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:46.560\n when you're talking about a global pandemic, right?\n\n2:03:46.560 --> 2:03:51.560\n So it's just, it's gonna kill a few million people\n\n2:03:51.600 --> 2:03:53.440\n or it looks like it's killed about 3 million people.\n\n2:03:53.440 --> 2:03:56.280\n Maybe it'll kill a few million more\n\n2:03:56.280 --> 2:03:58.160\n unless something gets away from us\n\n2:03:58.160 --> 2:04:00.920\n with a variant that's much worse\n\n2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:02.480\n or we really don't play our cards right.\n\n2:04:02.480 --> 2:04:06.320\n But I mean, the general shape of it is\n\n2:04:06.320 --> 2:04:11.320\n it's got somewhere around, well, 1% lethality\n\n2:04:12.920 --> 2:04:17.920\n and whatever side of that number it really is on\n\n2:04:18.280 --> 2:04:23.280\n in the end, it's not what would in fact be possible\n\n2:04:23.720 --> 2:04:26.520\n and is in fact probably inevitable\n\n2:04:26.520 --> 2:04:29.600\n something with orders of magnitude,\n\n2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:30.800\n more lethality than that.\n\n2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:35.360\n And it's just so obvious we are totally unprepared, right?\n\n2:04:35.360 --> 2:04:39.800\n We are running this epidemiological experiment\n\n2:04:39.800 --> 2:04:41.640\n of linking the entire world together\n\n2:04:41.640 --> 2:04:46.320\n and then also now per the podcast that Rob Reed did\n\n2:04:47.720 --> 2:04:51.000\n democratizing the tech that will allow us to do this\n\n2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:53.200\n to engineer pandemics, right?\n\n2:04:53.200 --> 2:04:56.920\n And more and more people will be able\n\n2:04:56.920 --> 2:05:00.800\n to engineer synthetic viruses that will be\n\n2:05:02.800 --> 2:05:04.920\n by the sheer fact that they would have been engineered\n\n2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:08.600\n with malicious intent, worse than COVID.\n\n2:05:08.600 --> 2:05:11.600\n And we're still living in,\n\n2:05:11.600 --> 2:05:13.880\n to speak specifically about the United States,\n\n2:05:13.880 --> 2:05:17.920\n we have a country here where we can't even agree\n\n2:05:17.920 --> 2:05:20.320\n that this is a thing, like that COVID,\n\n2:05:20.320 --> 2:05:21.440\n I mean, there's still people who think\n\n2:05:21.440 --> 2:05:25.560\n that this is basically a hoax designed to control people.\n\n2:05:25.560 --> 2:05:30.560\n And stranger still, there are people who will acknowledge\n\n2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:34.640\n that COVID is real and they'll look,\n\n2:05:34.640 --> 2:05:38.520\n they don't think the deaths have been faked or misascribed,\n\n2:05:42.640 --> 2:05:47.440\n but they think that they're far happier\n\n2:05:47.440 --> 2:05:49.440\n at the prospect of catching COVID\n\n2:05:49.440 --> 2:05:53.520\n than they are of getting vaccinated for COVID, right?\n\n2:05:53.520 --> 2:05:54.520\n They're not worried about COVID,\n\n2:05:54.520 --> 2:05:57.000\n they're worried about vaccines for COVID, right?\n\n2:05:57.000 --> 2:06:01.000\n And the fact that we just can't converge in a conversation\n\n2:06:01.000 --> 2:06:05.960\n that we've now had a year to have with one another\n\n2:06:05.960 --> 2:06:08.160\n on just what is the ground truth here?\n\n2:06:08.160 --> 2:06:09.800\n What's happened?\n\n2:06:09.800 --> 2:06:11.000\n Why has it happened?\n\n2:06:12.760 --> 2:06:17.760\n How safe is it to get COVID in every cohort\n\n2:06:17.760 --> 2:06:19.240\n in the population?\n\n2:06:19.240 --> 2:06:21.040\n And how safe are the vaccines?\n\n2:06:21.040 --> 2:06:23.920\n And the fact that there's still an air of mystery\n\n2:06:23.920 --> 2:06:27.280\n around all of this for much of our society\n\n2:06:28.240 --> 2:06:30.680\n does not bode well when you're talking about solving\n\n2:06:30.680 --> 2:06:32.840\n any other problem that may yet kill us.\n\n2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:34.400\n But do you think convergence grows\n\n2:06:34.400 --> 2:06:36.560\n with the magnitude of the threat?\n\n2:06:36.560 --> 2:06:40.800\n It's possible, except I feel like we have tipped into,\n\n2:06:40.800 --> 2:06:45.800\n because when the threat of COVID looked the most dire,\n\n2:06:45.920 --> 2:06:48.880\n when we were seeing reports from Italy\n\n2:06:48.880 --> 2:06:51.600\n that looked like the beginning of a zombie movie.\n\n2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:52.760\n Because it could have been much, much worse.\n\n2:06:52.760 --> 2:06:55.480\n Yeah, this is lethal, right?\n\n2:06:55.480 --> 2:06:57.920\n Your ICUs are gonna fill up in,\n\n2:06:57.920 --> 2:06:59.680\n you're 14 days behind us.\n\n2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:04.760\n Your medical system is in danger of collapse.\n\n2:07:04.760 --> 2:07:06.640\n Lock the fuck down.\n\n2:07:06.640 --> 2:07:11.640\n We have people refusing to do anything sane\n\n2:07:11.680 --> 2:07:12.920\n in the face of that.\n\n2:07:12.920 --> 2:07:14.880\n People fundamentally thinking,\n\n2:07:14.880 --> 2:07:17.320\n it's not gonna get here, right?\n\n2:07:17.320 --> 2:07:18.480\n Who knows what's going on in Italy,\n\n2:07:18.480 --> 2:07:21.480\n but it has no implications for what's gonna go on in New York\n\n2:07:21.480 --> 2:07:23.360\n in a mere six days, right?\n\n2:07:23.360 --> 2:07:25.320\n And now it kicks off in New York,\n\n2:07:25.320 --> 2:07:27.720\n and you've got people in the middle of the country\n\n2:07:27.720 --> 2:07:31.720\n thinking it's no factor, it's not,\n\n2:07:31.720 --> 2:07:34.240\n that's just big city, those are big city problems,\n\n2:07:34.240 --> 2:07:35.520\n or they're faking it.\n\n2:07:35.520 --> 2:07:40.080\n Or, I mean, it just, the layer of politics\n\n2:07:40.080 --> 2:07:42.600\n has become so dysfunctional for us\n\n2:07:42.600 --> 2:07:47.600\n that even in the presence of a pandemic\n\n2:07:48.320 --> 2:07:50.920\n that looked legitimately scary there in the beginning,\n\n2:07:50.920 --> 2:07:52.880\n I mean, it's not to say that it hasn't been devastating\n\n2:07:52.880 --> 2:07:54.920\n for everyone who's been directly affected by it,\n\n2:07:54.920 --> 2:07:56.800\n and it's not to say it can't get worse,\n\n2:07:56.800 --> 2:07:58.920\n but here, for a very long time,\n\n2:07:58.920 --> 2:08:01.960\n we have known that we were in a situation\n\n2:08:01.960 --> 2:08:05.840\n that is more benign than what seemed\n\n2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:08.760\n like the worst case scenario as it was kicking off,\n\n2:08:08.760 --> 2:08:09.840\n especially in Italy.\n\n2:08:11.640 --> 2:08:15.560\n And so still, yeah, it's quite possible\n\n2:08:15.560 --> 2:08:18.720\n that if we saw the asteroid hurtling toward Earth\n\n2:08:18.720 --> 2:08:23.040\n and everyone agreed that it's gonna make impact\n\n2:08:23.040 --> 2:08:25.040\n and we're all gonna die,\n\n2:08:25.040 --> 2:08:27.680\n then we could get off Twitter\n\n2:08:27.680 --> 2:08:30.200\n and actually build the rockets\n\n2:08:30.200 --> 2:08:32.960\n that are gonna divert the asteroid\n\n2:08:32.960 --> 2:08:35.080\n from its Earth crossing path,\n\n2:08:35.080 --> 2:08:37.720\n and we could do something pretty heroic.\n\n2:08:37.720 --> 2:08:41.520\n But when you talk about anything else\n\n2:08:41.520 --> 2:08:46.520\n that isn't, that's slower moving than that,\n\n2:08:46.960 --> 2:08:48.560\n I mean, something like climate change,\n\n2:08:48.560 --> 2:08:53.560\n I think the prospect of our converging\n\n2:08:54.440 --> 2:08:56.000\n on a solution to climate change\n\n2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:58.880\n purely based on political persuasion\n\n2:08:58.880 --> 2:09:00.520\n is nonexistent at this point.\n\n2:09:00.520 --> 2:09:04.400\n I just think, to bring Elon back into this,\n\n2:09:04.400 --> 2:09:05.960\n the way to deal with climate change\n\n2:09:05.960 --> 2:09:09.680\n is to create technology that everyone wants\n\n2:09:09.680 --> 2:09:14.520\n that is better than all the carbon producing technology,\n\n2:09:14.520 --> 2:09:15.640\n and then we just transition\n\n2:09:15.640 --> 2:09:19.240\n because you want an electric car\n\n2:09:19.240 --> 2:09:20.640\n the same way you wanted a smartphone\n\n2:09:20.640 --> 2:09:22.720\n or you want anything else,\n\n2:09:22.720 --> 2:09:24.840\n and you're working totally with the grain\n\n2:09:24.840 --> 2:09:29.040\n of people's selfishness and short term thinking.\n\n2:09:29.040 --> 2:09:31.080\n The idea that we're gonna convince\n\n2:09:31.080 --> 2:09:33.160\n the better part of humanity\n\n2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:35.440\n that climate change is an emergency,\n\n2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:39.000\n that they have to make sacrifices to respond to,\n\n2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:41.120\n given what's happened around COVID,\n\n2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:46.120\n I just think that's the fantasy of a fantasy.\n\n2:09:46.280 --> 2:09:48.160\n But speaking of Elon,\n\n2:09:48.160 --> 2:09:49.680\n I have a bunch of positive things\n\n2:09:49.680 --> 2:09:51.680\n that I wanna say here in response to you,\n\n2:09:51.680 --> 2:09:53.640\n but you're opening so many threads,\n\n2:09:53.640 --> 2:09:57.720\n but let me pull one of them, which is AI.\n\n2:09:57.720 --> 2:10:02.440\n Both you and Elon think that with AI,\n\n2:10:02.440 --> 2:10:05.520\n you're summoning demons, summoning a demon,\n\n2:10:05.520 --> 2:10:07.480\n maybe not in those poetic terms, but.\n\n2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:10.760\n Well, potentially. Potentially.\n\n2:10:10.760 --> 2:10:15.760\n Two very, three very parsimonious assumptions,\n\n2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:18.600\n I think, here.\n\n2:10:18.600 --> 2:10:21.360\n Scientifically, parsimonious assumptions get me there.\n\n2:10:25.160 --> 2:10:26.200\n Any of which could be wrong,\n\n2:10:26.200 --> 2:10:28.600\n but it just seems like the weight\n\n2:10:28.600 --> 2:10:31.440\n of the evidence is on their side.\n\n2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:34.040\n One is that it comes back to this topic\n\n2:10:34.040 --> 2:10:36.960\n of substrate independence, right?\n\n2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:38.160\n Anyone who's in the business\n\n2:10:38.160 --> 2:10:40.480\n of producing intelligent machines\n\n2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:43.880\n must believe, ultimately,\n\n2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:45.720\n that there's nothing magical\n\n2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:47.360\n about having a computer made of meat.\n\n2:10:47.360 --> 2:10:50.800\n You can do this in the kinds of materials\n\n2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:53.480\n we're using now,\n\n2:10:53.480 --> 2:10:56.800\n and there's no special something\n\n2:10:56.800 --> 2:11:00.960\n that presents a real impediment\n\n2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:04.800\n to producing human level intelligence in silico, right?\n\n2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:08.320\n Again, an assumption, I'm sure there are a few people\n\n2:11:08.320 --> 2:11:09.800\n who still think there is something magical\n\n2:11:09.800 --> 2:11:12.840\n about biological systems,\n\n2:11:12.840 --> 2:11:15.080\n but leave that aside.\n\n2:11:18.720 --> 2:11:20.520\n Given that assumption,\n\n2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:21.440\n and given the assumption\n\n2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:24.640\n that we just continue making incremental progress,\n\n2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:25.800\n doesn't have to be Moore's Law,\n\n2:11:25.800 --> 2:11:27.040\n it just has to be progress,\n\n2:11:27.040 --> 2:11:29.040\n that just doesn't stop,\n\n2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:30.440\n at a certain point,\n\n2:11:30.440 --> 2:11:34.600\n we'll get to human level intelligence and beyond.\n\n2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:36.400\n And human level intelligence,\n\n2:11:36.400 --> 2:11:38.560\n I think, is also clearly a mirage,\n\n2:11:38.560 --> 2:11:40.520\n because anything that's human level\n\n2:11:40.520 --> 2:11:42.480\n is gonna be superhuman\n\n2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:44.840\n by unless we decide to dumb it down, right?\n\n2:11:44.840 --> 2:11:47.480\n I mean, my phone is already superhuman as a calculator,\n\n2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:51.240\n right, so why would we make the human level AI\n\n2:11:51.240 --> 2:11:54.880\n just as good as me as a calculator?\n\n2:11:54.880 --> 2:11:57.280\n So I think we'll very,\n\n2:11:57.280 --> 2:11:59.440\n if we continue to make progress,\n\n2:11:59.440 --> 2:12:03.800\n we will be in the presence of superhuman competence\n\n2:12:03.800 --> 2:12:08.800\n for any act of intelligence or cognition\n\n2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:11.120\n that we care to prioritize.\n\n2:12:11.120 --> 2:12:13.440\n It's not to say that we'll create everything\n\n2:12:13.440 --> 2:12:14.280\n that a human could do,\n\n2:12:14.280 --> 2:12:16.440\n maybe we'll leave certain things out,\n\n2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:18.600\n but anything that we care about,\n\n2:12:18.600 --> 2:12:20.520\n and we care about a lot,\n\n2:12:20.520 --> 2:12:21.920\n and we certainly care about anything\n\n2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:24.560\n that produces a lot of power,\n\n2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:26.920\n that we care about scientific insights\n\n2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:30.680\n and an ability to produce new technology and all of that,\n\n2:12:30.680 --> 2:12:34.320\n we'll have something that's superhuman.\n\n2:12:34.320 --> 2:12:38.000\n And then the final assumption is just that\n\n2:12:39.320 --> 2:12:42.680\n there have to be ways to do that\n\n2:12:42.680 --> 2:12:46.520\n that are not aligned with a happy coexistence\n\n2:12:46.520 --> 2:12:51.360\n with these now more powerful entities than ourselves.\n\n2:12:51.360 --> 2:12:54.200\n So, and I would guess,\n\n2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:57.160\n and this is kind of a rider to that assumption,\n\n2:12:57.160 --> 2:12:59.680\n there are probably more ways to do it badly\n\n2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:01.600\n than to do it perfectly.\n\n2:13:01.600 --> 2:13:05.760\n That is perfectly aligned with our wellbeing.\n\n2:13:05.760 --> 2:13:10.760\n And when you think about the consequences of nonalignment,\n\n2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:11.960\n when you think about,\n\n2:13:13.800 --> 2:13:15.560\n you're now in the presence of something\n\n2:13:15.560 --> 2:13:18.480\n that is more intelligent than you are, right?\n\n2:13:18.480 --> 2:13:20.200\n Which is to say more competent, right?\n\n2:13:20.200 --> 2:13:24.840\n Unless you've, and obviously there are cartoon pictures\n\n2:13:24.840 --> 2:13:26.280\n of this where we could just,\n\n2:13:26.280 --> 2:13:27.320\n this is just an off switch,\n\n2:13:27.320 --> 2:13:28.480\n we could just turn off the off switch,\n\n2:13:28.480 --> 2:13:31.640\n or they're tethered to something that makes them,\n\n2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:33.720\n our slaves in perpetuity,\n\n2:13:33.720 --> 2:13:34.880\n even though they're more intelligent.\n\n2:13:34.880 --> 2:13:39.720\n But those scenarios strike me as a failure to imagine\n\n2:13:39.720 --> 2:13:42.320\n what is actually entailed by greater intelligence, right?\n\n2:13:42.320 --> 2:13:43.480\n So if you imagine something\n\n2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:46.520\n that's legitimately more intelligent than you are,\n\n2:13:47.800 --> 2:13:51.320\n and you're now in relationship to it, right?\n\n2:13:51.320 --> 2:13:52.640\n You're in the presence of this thing\n\n2:13:52.640 --> 2:13:54.800\n and it is autonomous in all kinds of ways\n\n2:13:54.800 --> 2:13:57.080\n because it had to be to be more intelligent than you are.\n\n2:13:57.080 --> 2:14:00.400\n I mean, you built it to be all of those things.\n\n2:14:01.800 --> 2:14:05.640\n We just can't find ourselves in a negotiation\n\n2:14:05.640 --> 2:14:08.000\n with something more intelligent than we are, you know?\n\n2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:10.480\n And we can't, so we have to have found\n\n2:14:10.480 --> 2:14:15.160\n the subset of ways to build these machines\n\n2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:21.080\n that are perpetually amenable to our saying,\n\n2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:25.000\n oh, that's not what we meant, that's not what we intended.\n\n2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.160\n Could you stop doing that, just come back over here\n\n2:14:27.160 --> 2:14:29.400\n and do this thing that we actually want.\n\n2:14:29.400 --> 2:14:31.600\n And for them to care, for them to be tethered\n\n2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:33.880\n to our own sense of our own wellbeing,\n\n2:14:35.560 --> 2:14:39.080\n such that, you know, I mean, their utility function is,\n\n2:14:39.080 --> 2:14:41.560\n you know, their primary utility function is for,\n\n2:14:41.560 --> 2:14:43.240\n is to have, you know, this is, I think,\n\n2:14:43.240 --> 2:14:48.240\n Stuart Russell's cartoon plan is to figure out\n\n2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:53.920\n how to tether them to a utility function\n\n2:14:53.920 --> 2:14:58.920\n that has our own estimation of what's going to improve\n\n2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:04.600\n our wellbeing as its master, you know, reward, right?\n\n2:15:05.520 --> 2:15:07.680\n So it's like, all that, this thing can get\n\n2:15:07.680 --> 2:15:10.040\n as intelligent as it can get,\n\n2:15:10.040 --> 2:15:13.000\n but it only ever really wants to figure out\n\n2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:16.040\n how to make our lives better by our own view of better.\n\n2:15:16.040 --> 2:15:19.240\n Now, not to say there wouldn't be a conversation about,\n\n2:15:19.240 --> 2:15:21.040\n you know, I mean, because there's all kinds of things\n\n2:15:21.040 --> 2:15:24.720\n we're not seeing clearly about what is better,\n\n2:15:24.720 --> 2:15:27.600\n and if we were in the presence of a genie or an oracle\n\n2:15:27.600 --> 2:15:29.200\n that could really tell us what is better,\n\n2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:32.080\n well, then we presumably would want to hear that,\n\n2:15:32.080 --> 2:15:37.080\n and we would modify our sense of what to do next\n\n2:15:37.800 --> 2:15:41.000\n in conversation with these minds.\n\n2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:45.240\n But I just feel like it is a failure of imagination\n\n2:15:45.240 --> 2:15:50.240\n to think that being in relationship to something\n\n2:15:55.160 --> 2:15:59.560\n more intelligent than yourself isn't in most cases\n\n2:16:00.600 --> 2:16:05.800\n a circumstance of real peril, because it is.\n\n2:16:05.800 --> 2:16:09.440\n Just to think of how everything on Earth has to,\n\n2:16:09.440 --> 2:16:12.120\n if they could think about their relationship to us,\n\n2:16:12.120 --> 2:16:16.520\n if birds could think about what we're doing, right?\n\n2:16:16.520 --> 2:16:21.400\n They would, I mean, the bottom line is\n\n2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:26.040\n they're always in danger of our discovering\n\n2:16:26.040 --> 2:16:29.440\n that there's something we care about more than birds, right?\n\n2:16:29.440 --> 2:16:30.920\n Or there's something we want\n\n2:16:30.920 --> 2:16:34.240\n that disregards the wellbeing of birds.\n\n2:16:34.240 --> 2:16:37.720\n And obviously much of our behavior is inscrutable to them.\n\n2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:39.080\n Occasionally we pay attention to them,\n\n2:16:39.080 --> 2:16:41.640\n and occasionally we withdraw our attention,\n\n2:16:41.640 --> 2:16:43.080\n and occasionally we just kill them all\n\n2:16:43.080 --> 2:16:45.480\n for reasons they can't possibly understand.\n\n2:16:45.480 --> 2:16:48.320\n But if we're building something more intelligent\n\n2:16:48.320 --> 2:16:49.840\n than ourselves, by definition,\n\n2:16:49.840 --> 2:16:52.920\n we're building something whose horizons\n\n2:16:52.920 --> 2:16:57.920\n of value and cognition can exceed our own\n\n2:17:00.040 --> 2:17:05.040\n and in ways where we can't necessarily foresee,\n\n2:17:05.240 --> 2:17:09.280\n again, perpetually, that they don't just wake up one day\n\n2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:14.200\n and decide, okay, well, these humans need to disappear.\n\n2:17:14.200 --> 2:17:19.200\n So I think I agree with most of the initial things you said.\n\n2:17:19.720 --> 2:17:22.520\n What I don't necessarily agree with,\n\n2:17:22.520 --> 2:17:24.040\n and of course nobody knows,\n\n2:17:24.040 --> 2:17:27.520\n but that the more likely set of trajectories\n\n2:17:27.520 --> 2:17:30.360\n that we're going to take are going to be positive.\n\n2:17:30.360 --> 2:17:32.600\n That's what I believe in the sense\n\n2:17:32.600 --> 2:17:35.840\n that the way you develop,\n\n2:17:35.840 --> 2:17:40.280\n I believe the way you develop successful AI systems\n\n2:17:40.280 --> 2:17:43.720\n will be deeply integrated with human society.\n\n2:17:43.720 --> 2:17:45.360\n And for them to succeed,\n\n2:17:45.360 --> 2:17:48.040\n they're going to have to be aligned\n\n2:17:48.040 --> 2:17:50.320\n in the way we humans are aligned with each other,\n\n2:17:50.320 --> 2:17:52.560\n which doesn't mean we're aligned.\n\n2:17:52.560 --> 2:17:54.720\n There's no such thing,\n\n2:17:54.720 --> 2:17:57.880\n or I don't see there's such thing as a perfect alignment,\n\n2:17:57.880 --> 2:18:01.080\n but they're going to be participating in the dance,\n\n2:18:01.080 --> 2:18:04.560\n in the game theoretic dance of human society,\n\n2:18:04.560 --> 2:18:06.520\n as they become more and more intelligent.\n\n2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:09.240\n There could be a point beyond which\n\n2:18:09.240 --> 2:18:11.520\n we are like birds to them.\n\n2:18:12.480 --> 2:18:16.080\n But what about an intelligence explosion of some kind?\n\n2:18:16.080 --> 2:18:21.080\n So I believe the explosion will be happening,\n\n2:18:21.080 --> 2:18:24.120\n but there's a lot of explosion to be done\n\n2:18:24.120 --> 2:18:26.200\n before we become like birds.\n\n2:18:26.200 --> 2:18:28.120\n I truly believe that human beings\n\n2:18:28.120 --> 2:18:30.680\n are very intelligent in ways we don't understand.\n\n2:18:30.680 --> 2:18:32.280\n It's not just about chess.\n\n2:18:32.280 --> 2:18:35.360\n It's about all the intricate computation\n\n2:18:35.360 --> 2:18:37.640\n we're able to perform, common sense,\n\n2:18:37.640 --> 2:18:40.600\n our ability to reason about this world, consciousness.\n\n2:18:40.600 --> 2:18:42.400\n I think we're doing a lot of work\n\n2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:44.560\n we don't realize is necessary to be done\n\n2:18:44.560 --> 2:18:47.720\n in order to truly become,\n\n2:18:47.720 --> 2:18:49.960\n like truly achieve super intelligence.\n\n2:18:49.960 --> 2:18:52.120\n And I just think there'll be a period of time\n\n2:18:52.120 --> 2:18:53.720\n that's not overnight.\n\n2:18:53.720 --> 2:18:57.120\n The overnight nature of it will not literally be overnight.\n\n2:18:57.120 --> 2:18:59.520\n It'll be over a period of decades.\n\n2:18:59.520 --> 2:19:00.360\n So my sense is...\n\n2:19:00.360 --> 2:19:02.960\n So why would it be that, but just take,\n\n2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:06.400\n draw an analogy from recent successes,\n\n2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:09.400\n like something like AlphaGo or AlphaZero.\n\n2:19:09.400 --> 2:19:11.720\n I forget the actual metric,\n\n2:19:11.720 --> 2:19:14.800\n but it was something like this algorithm,\n\n2:19:15.680 --> 2:19:17.280\n which wasn't even totally,\n\n2:19:17.280 --> 2:19:19.400\n it wasn't bespoke for chess playing,\n\n2:19:21.440 --> 2:19:24.120\n in the matter of, I think it was four hours,\n\n2:19:24.120 --> 2:19:27.200\n played itself so many times and so successfully\n\n2:19:27.200 --> 2:19:30.960\n that it became the best chess playing computer.\n\n2:19:30.960 --> 2:19:33.680\n It was not only better than every human being,\n\n2:19:33.680 --> 2:19:36.760\n it was better than every previous chess program\n\n2:19:36.760 --> 2:19:38.600\n in a matter of a day, right?\n\n2:19:38.600 --> 2:19:41.000\n So just imagine, again,\n\n2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:43.720\n we don't have to recapitulate everything about us,\n\n2:19:43.720 --> 2:19:45.640\n but just imagine building a system,\n\n2:19:47.960 --> 2:19:50.440\n and who knows when we'll be able to do this,\n\n2:19:50.440 --> 2:19:52.000\n but at some point we'll be able,\n\n2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:56.080\n at some point the 100 or 100 favorite things\n\n2:19:56.080 --> 2:20:01.080\n about human cognition will be analogous to chess\n\n2:20:01.240 --> 2:20:03.920\n in that we will be able to build machines\n\n2:20:03.920 --> 2:20:07.960\n that very quickly outperform any human,\n\n2:20:07.960 --> 2:20:12.120\n and then very quickly outperform the last algorithm\n\n2:20:12.120 --> 2:20:13.520\n that outperform the humans.\n\n2:20:13.520 --> 2:20:17.400\n Like something like the AlphaGo experience\n\n2:20:17.400 --> 2:20:21.520\n seems possible for facial recognition\n\n2:20:21.520 --> 2:20:23.720\n and detecting human emotion\n\n2:20:23.720 --> 2:20:26.280\n and natural language processing, right?\n\n2:20:26.280 --> 2:20:29.640\n Well, it's just that everyone,\n\n2:20:29.640 --> 2:20:33.080\n even math people, math heads,\n\n2:20:33.080 --> 2:20:36.480\n tend to have bad intuitions for exponentiation, right?\n\n2:20:36.480 --> 2:20:37.640\n I mean, we noticed this during COVID.\n\n2:20:37.640 --> 2:20:39.200\n I mean, you have some very smart people\n\n2:20:39.200 --> 2:20:42.600\n who still couldn't get their minds around the fact\n\n2:20:42.600 --> 2:20:46.760\n that an exponential is really surprising.\n\n2:20:46.760 --> 2:20:49.440\n I mean, things double and double and double and double again,\n\n2:20:49.440 --> 2:20:51.200\n and you don't notice much of anything changes,\n\n2:20:51.200 --> 2:20:56.200\n and then the last two stages of doubling swamp everything.\n\n2:20:56.280 --> 2:20:59.640\n And it just seems like that,\n\n2:20:59.640 --> 2:21:04.640\n to assume that there isn't a deep analogy\n\n2:21:04.680 --> 2:21:09.680\n between what we're seeing for the more tractable problems,\n\n2:21:09.800 --> 2:21:13.160\n like chess, to other modes of cognition,\n\n2:21:13.160 --> 2:21:16.080\n it's like once you crack that problem,\n\n2:21:16.080 --> 2:21:17.960\n it seems, because for the longest time,\n\n2:21:17.960 --> 2:21:20.840\n it was impossible to think\n\n2:21:20.840 --> 2:21:25.080\n we were gonna make headway in AI, you know, it's like.\n\n2:21:25.080 --> 2:21:27.560\n Chess and Go was seen as impossible.\n\n2:21:27.560 --> 2:21:29.200\n Yeah, Go seemed unattainable.\n\n2:21:29.200 --> 2:21:33.360\n Even when chess had been cracked, Go seemed unattainable.\n\n2:21:33.360 --> 2:21:37.000\n Yeah, and actually still Russell was behind the people\n\n2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:38.960\n that were saying it's unattainable,\n\n2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:42.840\n because it seemed like it's intractable problem.\n\n2:21:42.840 --> 2:21:44.440\n But there's something different\n\n2:21:44.440 --> 2:21:46.560\n about the space of cognition\n\n2:21:46.560 --> 2:21:49.640\n that's detached from human society, which is what chess is,\n\n2:21:49.640 --> 2:21:51.240\n meaning like just thinking,\n\n2:21:52.120 --> 2:21:54.280\n having actual exponential impact\n\n2:21:54.280 --> 2:21:56.560\n on the physical world is different.\n\n2:21:56.560 --> 2:21:58.280\n I tend to believe that there's,\n\n2:22:00.040 --> 2:22:03.680\n for AI to get to the point where it's super intelligent,\n\n2:22:03.680 --> 2:22:07.680\n it's going to have to go through the funnel of society.\n\n2:22:07.680 --> 2:22:09.560\n And for that, it has to be deeply integrated\n\n2:22:09.560 --> 2:22:12.880\n with human beings, and for that, it has to be aligned.\n\n2:22:12.880 --> 2:22:15.560\n But you're talking about like actually hooking us up\n\n2:22:15.560 --> 2:22:16.800\n to like the neural link, you know,\n\n2:22:16.800 --> 2:22:21.800\n we're gonna be the brainstem to the robot overlords?\n\n2:22:22.200 --> 2:22:23.360\n That's a possibility as well.\n\n2:22:23.360 --> 2:22:25.120\n But what I mean is,\n\n2:22:25.120 --> 2:22:28.840\n in order to develop autonomous weapon systems, for example,\n\n2:22:28.840 --> 2:22:31.280\n which are highly concerning to me\n\n2:22:31.280 --> 2:22:34.760\n that both US and China are participating in now,\n\n2:22:34.760 --> 2:22:38.320\n that in order to develop them and for them to become,\n\n2:22:38.320 --> 2:22:40.160\n to have more and more responsibility\n\n2:22:40.160 --> 2:22:44.520\n to actually do military strategic actions,\n\n2:22:44.520 --> 2:22:47.960\n they're going to have to be integrated\n\n2:22:47.960 --> 2:22:51.760\n into human beings doing the strategic action.\n\n2:22:51.760 --> 2:22:54.160\n They're going to have to work alongside with each other.\n\n2:22:54.160 --> 2:22:56.480\n And the way those systems will be developed\n\n2:22:56.480 --> 2:23:00.120\n will have the natural safety, like switches\n\n2:23:00.120 --> 2:23:03.080\n that are placed on them as they develop over time,\n\n2:23:03.080 --> 2:23:05.360\n because they're going to have to convince humans.\n\n2:23:05.360 --> 2:23:07.800\n Ultimately, they're going to have to convince humans\n\n2:23:07.800 --> 2:23:10.480\n that this is safer than humans.\n\n2:23:10.480 --> 2:23:12.440\n They're going to, you know.\n\n2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:15.680\n Self driving cars is a good test case here\n\n2:23:15.680 --> 2:23:19.600\n because like, obviously we've made a lot of progress\n\n2:23:19.600 --> 2:23:24.600\n and we can imagine what total progress would look like.\n\n2:23:24.920 --> 2:23:25.880\n I mean, it would be amazing.\n\n2:23:25.880 --> 2:23:29.040\n And it's answering, it's canceling in the US\n\n2:23:29.040 --> 2:23:33.120\n 40,000 deaths every year based on ape driven cars, right?\n\n2:23:33.120 --> 2:23:36.640\n So it's a excruciating problem that we've all gotten used to\n\n2:23:36.640 --> 2:23:38.400\n because there was no alternative.\n\n2:23:38.400 --> 2:23:41.640\n But now we can dimly see the prospect of an alternative,\n\n2:23:41.640 --> 2:23:45.760\n which if it works in a super intelligent fashion,\n\n2:23:45.760 --> 2:23:48.960\n maybe we would go down to zero highway deaths, right?\n\n2:23:48.960 --> 2:23:50.760\n Or, you know, certainly we'd go down\n\n2:23:50.760 --> 2:23:51.960\n by orders of magnitude, right?\n\n2:23:51.960 --> 2:23:56.960\n So maybe we have, you know, 400 rather than 40,000 a year.\n\n2:23:59.680 --> 2:24:04.680\n And it's easy to see that there's not a missile.\n\n2:24:05.400 --> 2:24:08.040\n So obviously this is not an example of super intelligence.\n\n2:24:08.040 --> 2:24:09.200\n This is narrow intelligence,\n\n2:24:09.200 --> 2:24:14.200\n but the alignment problem isn't so obvious there,\n\n2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:17.640\n but there are potential alignment problems there.\n\n2:24:17.640 --> 2:24:22.560\n Like, so like, just imagine if some woke team of engineers\n\n2:24:22.560 --> 2:24:26.680\n decided that we have to tune the algorithm some way.\n\n2:24:26.680 --> 2:24:28.560\n I mean, there are situations where the car\n\n2:24:28.560 --> 2:24:30.080\n has to decide who to hit.\n\n2:24:30.080 --> 2:24:31.520\n I mean, there's just bad outcomes\n\n2:24:31.520 --> 2:24:33.960\n where you're gonna hit somebody, right?\n\n2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:36.760\n Now we have a car that can tell what race you are, right?\n\n2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:39.240\n So we're gonna build the car to preferentially hit\n\n2:24:39.240 --> 2:24:42.080\n white people because white people have had so much privilege\n\n2:24:42.080 --> 2:24:43.240\n over the years.\n\n2:24:43.240 --> 2:24:44.880\n This seems like the only ethical way\n\n2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:47.260\n to kind of redress those wrongs of the past.\n\n2:24:47.260 --> 2:24:49.440\n That's something that could get, one,\n\n2:24:49.440 --> 2:24:53.160\n that could get produced as an artifact, presumably,\n\n2:24:53.160 --> 2:24:54.200\n of just how you built it\n\n2:24:54.200 --> 2:24:56.240\n and you didn't even know you engineered it that way, right?\n\n2:24:56.240 --> 2:24:57.760\n You caused it to...\n\n2:24:57.760 --> 2:24:58.880\n Through machine learning,\n\n2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:00.680\n you put some kind of constraints on it\n\n2:25:00.680 --> 2:25:02.480\n to where it creates those kinds of outcomes.\n\n2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:05.120\n Basically, you built a racist algorithm\n\n2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:06.360\n and you didn't even intend to,\n\n2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:07.880\n or you could intend to, right?\n\n2:25:07.880 --> 2:25:09.700\n And it would be aligned with some people's values\n\n2:25:09.700 --> 2:25:11.800\n but misaligned with other people's values.\n\n2:25:13.420 --> 2:25:16.480\n But it's like there are interesting problems\n\n2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:17.920\n even with something as simple\n\n2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:20.520\n and obviously good as self driving cars.\n\n2:25:20.520 --> 2:25:23.600\n But there's a leap that I just think it'd be exact,\n\n2:25:23.600 --> 2:25:25.320\n but those are human problems.\n\n2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:26.960\n I just don't think there'll be a leap\n\n2:25:26.960 --> 2:25:28.560\n with autonomous vehicles.\n\n2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:31.560\n First of all, sorry.\n\n2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:33.920\n There are a lot of trajectories\n\n2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:35.760\n which will destroy human civilization.\n\n2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:36.880\n The argument I'm making,\n\n2:25:36.880 --> 2:25:40.040\n it's more likely that we'll take trajectories that don't.\n\n2:25:40.040 --> 2:25:41.880\n So I don't think there'll be a leap\n\n2:25:41.880 --> 2:25:43.000\n with autonomous vehicles\n\n2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:45.960\n will all of a sudden start murdering pedestrians\n\n2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:49.280\n because once every human on earth is dead,\n\n2:25:49.280 --> 2:25:50.680\n there'll be no more fatalities,\n\n2:25:50.680 --> 2:25:52.820\n sort of unintended consequences of...\n\n2:25:52.820 --> 2:25:55.520\n And it's difficult to take that leap.\n\n2:25:55.520 --> 2:25:57.160\n Most systems as we develop\n\n2:25:57.160 --> 2:25:59.120\n and they become much, much more intelligent\n\n2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:01.280\n in ways that will be incredibly surprising,\n\n2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:04.480\n like stuff that DeepMind is doing with protein folding.\n\n2:26:04.480 --> 2:26:07.840\n Even, which is scary to think about,\n\n2:26:07.840 --> 2:26:09.520\n and I'm personally terrified about this,\n\n2:26:09.520 --> 2:26:12.760\n which is the engineering of viruses using machine learning,\n\n2:26:12.760 --> 2:26:16.880\n the engineering of vaccines using machine learning,\n\n2:26:16.880 --> 2:26:20.840\n the engineering of, yeah, for research purposes,\n\n2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:23.520\n pathogens using machine learning\n\n2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:25.080\n and the ways that can go wrong.\n\n2:26:25.080 --> 2:26:27.380\n I just think that there's always going to be\n\n2:26:27.380 --> 2:26:30.800\n a closed loop supervision of humans\n\n2:26:30.800 --> 2:26:33.560\n before the AI becomes super intelligent.\n\n2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:38.260\n Not always, much more likely to be supervision,\n\n2:26:38.260 --> 2:26:40.520\n except, of course, the question is\n\n2:26:40.520 --> 2:26:42.120\n how many dumb people there are in the world,\n\n2:26:42.120 --> 2:26:44.440\n how many evil people are in the world?\n\n2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:48.800\n My theory, my hope is, my sense is\n\n2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:50.640\n that the number of intelligent people\n\n2:26:50.640 --> 2:26:52.920\n is much higher than the number of dumb people\n\n2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:55.320\n that know how to program\n\n2:26:55.320 --> 2:26:57.680\n and the number of evil people.\n\n2:26:57.680 --> 2:26:59.920\n I think smart people and kind people\n\n2:26:59.920 --> 2:27:03.260\n over outnumber the others.\n\n2:27:03.260 --> 2:27:06.340\n Except we also have to add another group of people\n\n2:27:06.340 --> 2:27:09.880\n which are just the smart and otherwise good\n\n2:27:09.880 --> 2:27:12.160\n but reckless people, right?\n\n2:27:12.160 --> 2:27:15.440\n The people who will flip a switch on\n\n2:27:15.440 --> 2:27:17.640\n not knowing what's going to happen.\n\n2:27:17.640 --> 2:27:19.040\n They're just kind of hoping\n\n2:27:19.040 --> 2:27:20.440\n that it's not going to blow up the world.\n\n2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:23.320\n We already know that some of our smartest people\n\n2:27:23.320 --> 2:27:24.680\n are those sorts of people.\n\n2:27:24.680 --> 2:27:26.140\n We know we've done experiments,\n\n2:27:26.140 --> 2:27:29.480\n and this is something that Martin Rees was whinging about\n\n2:27:29.480 --> 2:27:33.160\n before the Large Hadron Collider\n\n2:27:33.160 --> 2:27:34.740\n got booted up, I think.\n\n2:27:35.920 --> 2:27:38.720\n We know there are people who are entertaining experiments\n\n2:27:38.720 --> 2:27:40.000\n or even performing experiments\n\n2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:44.900\n where there's some chance, not quite infinitesimal,\n\n2:27:46.520 --> 2:27:48.840\n that they're going to create a black hole in the lab\n\n2:27:48.840 --> 2:27:50.720\n and suck the whole world into it.\n\n2:27:52.300 --> 2:27:55.860\n You're not a crazy person to worry about that\n\n2:27:55.860 --> 2:27:57.160\n based on the physics.\n\n2:27:57.160 --> 2:28:01.580\n And so it was with the Trinity test.\n\n2:28:01.580 --> 2:28:04.000\n There were some people who were still\n\n2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:07.160\n checking their calculations, and they were off.\n\n2:28:07.160 --> 2:28:10.320\n We did nuclear tests where we were off significantly\n\n2:28:10.320 --> 2:28:11.960\n in terms of the yield, right?\n\n2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:12.780\n So it was like.\n\n2:28:12.780 --> 2:28:13.760\n And they still flipped the switch.\n\n2:28:13.760 --> 2:28:14.960\n Yeah, they still flipped the switch.\n\n2:28:14.960 --> 2:28:16.600\n And sometimes they flipped the switch\n\n2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:21.600\n not to win a world war or to save 40,000 lives a year.\n\n2:28:22.920 --> 2:28:24.040\n They just, just.\n\n2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:24.880\n Just to see what happens.\n\n2:28:24.880 --> 2:28:25.880\n Intellectual curiosity.\n\n2:28:25.880 --> 2:28:27.740\n Like this is what I got my grant for.\n\n2:28:27.740 --> 2:28:30.120\n This is where I'll get my Nobel Prize\n\n2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:32.080\n if that's in the cards.\n\n2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:35.580\n It's on the other side of this switch, right?\n\n2:28:35.580 --> 2:28:40.580\n And I mean, again, we are apes with egos\n\n2:28:43.080 --> 2:28:45.880\n who are massively constrained\n\n2:28:45.880 --> 2:28:49.640\n by very short term self interest\n\n2:28:49.640 --> 2:28:52.860\n even when we're contemplating some of the deepest\n\n2:28:52.860 --> 2:28:57.700\n and most interesting and most universal problems\n\n2:28:57.700 --> 2:29:00.320\n we could ever set our attention towards.\n\n2:29:00.320 --> 2:29:03.160\n Like just if you read James Watson's book,\n\n2:29:03.160 --> 2:29:04.200\n The Double Helix, right?\n\n2:29:04.200 --> 2:29:08.620\n About them cracking the structure of DNA.\n\n2:29:09.740 --> 2:29:11.600\n One thing that's amazing about that book\n\n2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:15.960\n is just how much of it, almost all of it\n\n2:29:15.960 --> 2:29:20.960\n is being driven by very apish, egocentric social concerns.\n\n2:29:20.960 --> 2:29:25.140\n The algorithm that is producing this scientific breakthrough\n\n2:29:25.140 --> 2:29:28.640\n is human competition if you're James Watson.\n\n2:29:28.640 --> 2:29:30.880\n It's like, I'm gonna get there before Linus Pauling\n\n2:29:30.880 --> 2:29:35.880\n and it's just, it's so much of his bandwidth\n\n2:29:36.340 --> 2:29:37.760\n is captured by that, right?\n\n2:29:37.760 --> 2:29:41.760\n Now that becomes more and more of a liability\n\n2:29:41.760 --> 2:29:43.600\n when you think about it.\n\n2:29:43.600 --> 2:29:46.600\n I mean, it's like, I'm gonna get there before Linus Pauling\n\n2:29:46.600 --> 2:29:50.640\n and it's just, it's so much of his bandwidth\n\n2:29:50.640 --> 2:29:51.640\n is captured by that, right?\n\n2:29:51.640 --> 2:29:52.640\n Now that becomes more and more of a liability\n\n2:29:52.640 --> 2:29:53.560\n when you're talking about producing technology\n\n2:29:53.560 --> 2:29:55.960\n that can change everything in an instant.\n\n2:29:55.960 --> 2:30:00.360\n You know, we're talking about not only understanding,\n\n2:30:01.560 --> 2:30:03.300\n you know, we're just at a different moment\n\n2:30:03.300 --> 2:30:04.140\n in human history.\n\n2:30:04.140 --> 2:30:09.140\n We're not, when we're doing research on viruses,\n\n2:30:10.800 --> 2:30:13.120\n we're now doing the kind of research\n\n2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:16.080\n that can cause someone somewhere else\n\n2:30:16.080 --> 2:30:19.640\n to be able to make that virus or weaponize that virus\n\n2:30:19.640 --> 2:30:24.200\n or it's just, I don't know.\n\n2:30:24.200 --> 2:30:27.080\n I mean, our power is, our wisdom is,\n\n2:30:27.080 --> 2:30:30.920\n it does not seem like our wisdom is scaling with our power.\n\n2:30:30.920 --> 2:30:31.760\n Right?\n\n2:30:31.760 --> 2:30:36.320\n And like that seems like, insofar as wisdom and power\n\n2:30:36.320 --> 2:30:40.980\n become unaligned, I get more and more concerned.\n\n2:30:40.980 --> 2:30:44.760\n But speaking of apes with egos,\n\n2:30:45.800 --> 2:30:48.600\n some of the most compelling apes, two compelling apes,\n\n2:30:48.600 --> 2:30:51.720\n I can think of is yourself and Jordan Peterson.\n\n2:30:51.720 --> 2:30:56.040\n And you've had a fun conversation about religion\n\n2:30:56.040 --> 2:30:58.720\n that I watched most of, I believe.\n\n2:30:58.720 --> 2:31:00.560\n I'm not sure there was any...\n\n2:31:02.560 --> 2:31:03.880\n We didn't solve anything.\n\n2:31:03.880 --> 2:31:05.100\n If anything was ever solved.\n\n2:31:05.100 --> 2:31:09.440\n So is there something like a charitable summary\n\n2:31:09.440 --> 2:31:13.040\n you can give to the ideas that you agree on\n\n2:31:13.040 --> 2:31:14.340\n and disagree with Jordan?\n\n2:31:14.340 --> 2:31:16.480\n Is there something maybe after that conversation\n\n2:31:16.480 --> 2:31:21.480\n that you've landed where maybe as you both agreed on,\n\n2:31:22.640 --> 2:31:24.600\n is there some wisdom in the rubble\n\n2:31:24.600 --> 2:31:29.080\n of even imperfect flawed ideas?\n\n2:31:29.080 --> 2:31:31.360\n Is there something that you can kind of pull out\n\n2:31:31.360 --> 2:31:34.640\n from those conversations or is it to be continued?\n\n2:31:34.640 --> 2:31:35.960\n I mean, I think where we disagree.\n\n2:31:35.960 --> 2:31:40.960\n So he thinks that many of our traditional religious beliefs\n\n2:31:40.960 --> 2:31:45.960\n and frameworks are holding such a repository\n\n2:31:49.780 --> 2:31:54.780\n of human wisdom that we pull at that fabric\n\n2:31:59.860 --> 2:32:01.140\n at our peril, right?\n\n2:32:01.140 --> 2:32:04.300\n Like if you start just unraveling Christianity\n\n2:32:04.300 --> 2:32:08.260\n or any other traditional set of norms and beliefs\n\n2:32:08.260 --> 2:32:12.420\n you may think you're just pulling out the unscientific bits\n\n2:32:12.420 --> 2:32:14.380\n but you could be pulling a lot more\n\n2:32:14.380 --> 2:32:17.900\n to which everything you care about is attached, right?\n\n2:32:17.900 --> 2:32:19.060\n As a society.\n\n2:32:20.100 --> 2:32:25.100\n And my feeling is that there's so much downside\n\n2:32:26.300 --> 2:32:27.900\n to the unscientific bits.\n\n2:32:27.900 --> 2:32:32.900\n And it's so clear how we could have a 21st century\n\n2:32:33.140 --> 2:32:37.140\n rational conversation about the things that we don't know.\n\n2:32:37.140 --> 2:32:39.940\n A conversation about the good stuff\n\n2:32:39.940 --> 2:32:42.780\n that we really can radically edit these traditions.\n\n2:32:42.780 --> 2:32:47.660\n And we can take Jesus in half his moods\n\n2:32:47.660 --> 2:32:52.660\n and just find a great inspirational iron age thought leader\n\n2:32:54.900 --> 2:32:56.260\n who just happened to get crucified.\n\n2:32:56.260 --> 2:32:58.940\n But he could be somewhat like the Beatitudes\n\n2:32:58.940 --> 2:33:03.660\n and the golden rule, which doesn't originate with him\n\n2:33:03.660 --> 2:33:07.340\n but which he put quite beautifully.\n\n2:33:07.340 --> 2:33:09.780\n All of that's incredibly useful.\n\n2:33:09.780 --> 2:33:12.800\n It's no less useful than it was 2000 years ago.\n\n2:33:12.800 --> 2:33:14.980\n But we don't have to believe he was born of a virgin\n\n2:33:14.980 --> 2:33:16.780\n or coming back to raise the dead\n\n2:33:16.780 --> 2:33:18.660\n or any of that other stuff.\n\n2:33:18.660 --> 2:33:21.440\n And we can be honest about not believing those things.\n\n2:33:21.440 --> 2:33:22.980\n And we can be honest about the reasons\n\n2:33:22.980 --> 2:33:24.660\n why we don't believe those things.\n\n2:33:24.660 --> 2:33:29.660\n Because on those fronts I view the downside to be so obvious\n\n2:33:29.660 --> 2:33:33.580\n and the fact that we have so many different\n\n2:33:33.580 --> 2:33:37.220\n competing dogmatisms on offer to be so nonfunctional.\n\n2:33:37.220 --> 2:33:42.220\n I mean, it's so divisive, it just has conflict built into it\n\n2:33:42.620 --> 2:33:45.780\n that I think we can be far more\n\n2:33:45.780 --> 2:33:47.740\n and should be far more iconoclastic\n\n2:33:47.740 --> 2:33:50.340\n than he wants to be, right?\n\n2:33:50.340 --> 2:33:55.340\n Now, none of this is to deny much of what he argues for,\n\n2:33:55.340 --> 2:33:59.860\n that stories are very powerful.\n\n2:33:59.860 --> 2:34:01.940\n I mean, clearly stories are powerful\n\n2:34:01.940 --> 2:34:03.420\n and we want good stories.\n\n2:34:03.420 --> 2:34:06.180\n We want our lives, we wanna have a conversation\n\n2:34:06.180 --> 2:34:10.120\n with ourselves and with one another about our lives\n\n2:34:10.120 --> 2:34:13.500\n that facilitates the best possible lives.\n\n2:34:13.500 --> 2:34:15.500\n And story is part of that, right?\n\n2:34:15.500 --> 2:34:20.500\n And if you want some of those stories to sound like myths,\n\n2:34:21.180 --> 2:34:22.700\n that might be part of it, right?\n\n2:34:22.700 --> 2:34:26.220\n But my argument is that we never really need\n\n2:34:26.220 --> 2:34:29.220\n to deceive ourselves or our children\n\n2:34:29.220 --> 2:34:32.540\n about what we have every reason to believe is true\n\n2:34:32.540 --> 2:34:34.000\n in order to get at the good stuff,\n\n2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:36.340\n in order to organize our lives well.\n\n2:34:36.340 --> 2:34:39.220\n I certainly don't feel that I need to do it personally.\n\n2:34:39.220 --> 2:34:41.100\n And if I don't need to do it personally,\n\n2:34:41.100 --> 2:34:43.380\n why would I think that billions of other people\n\n2:34:43.380 --> 2:34:45.480\n need to do it personally, right?\n\n2:34:45.480 --> 2:34:48.660\n Now, there is a cynical counter argument,\n\n2:34:48.660 --> 2:34:51.260\n which is billions of other people\n\n2:34:51.260 --> 2:34:54.260\n don't have the advantages that I have had in my life.\n\n2:34:54.260 --> 2:34:57.700\n The billions of other people are not as well educated,\n\n2:34:57.700 --> 2:34:59.300\n they haven't had the same opportunities,\n\n2:34:59.300 --> 2:35:04.300\n they need to be told that Jesus is gonna solve\n\n2:35:04.560 --> 2:35:06.620\n all their problems after they die, say,\n\n2:35:06.620 --> 2:35:10.740\n or that everything happens for a reason\n\n2:35:10.740 --> 2:35:14.060\n and if you just believe in the secret,\n\n2:35:14.060 --> 2:35:16.240\n if you just visualize what you want, you're gonna get it.\n\n2:35:16.240 --> 2:35:20.940\n And it's like there's some measure\n\n2:35:20.940 --> 2:35:23.900\n of what I consider to be odious pamphlet\n\n2:35:23.900 --> 2:35:27.340\n that really is food for the better part of humanity\n\n2:35:27.340 --> 2:35:29.220\n and there is no substitute for it\n\n2:35:29.220 --> 2:35:31.020\n or there's no substitute now.\n\n2:35:31.020 --> 2:35:32.500\n And I don't know if Jordan would agree with that,\n\n2:35:32.500 --> 2:35:35.220\n but much of what he says seems to suggest\n\n2:35:35.220 --> 2:35:36.620\n that he would agree with it.\n\n2:35:39.340 --> 2:35:41.100\n And I guess that's an empirical question.\n\n2:35:41.100 --> 2:35:43.300\n I mean, that's just that we don't know\n\n2:35:43.300 --> 2:35:47.060\n whether given a different set of norms\n\n2:35:47.060 --> 2:35:48.580\n and a different set of stories,\n\n2:35:48.580 --> 2:35:52.820\n people would behave the way I would hope they would behave\n\n2:35:52.820 --> 2:35:56.060\n and be more aligned than they are now.\n\n2:35:56.060 --> 2:35:58.740\n I think we know what happens\n\n2:35:58.740 --> 2:36:03.740\n when you just let ancient religious certainties\n\n2:36:03.980 --> 2:36:06.380\n go uncriticized.\n\n2:36:06.380 --> 2:36:07.780\n We know what that world's like.\n\n2:36:07.780 --> 2:36:10.580\n We've been struggling to get out of that world\n\n2:36:10.580 --> 2:36:12.100\n for a couple of hundred years,\n\n2:36:12.100 --> 2:36:19.100\n but we know what having Europe riven by religious wars\n\n2:36:20.660 --> 2:36:21.820\n looks like.\n\n2:36:21.820 --> 2:36:25.220\n And we know what happens when those religions\n\n2:36:25.220 --> 2:36:29.740\n become kind of pseudo religions and political religions.\n\n2:36:29.740 --> 2:36:33.800\n So this is where I'm sure Jordan and I would debate.\n\n2:36:33.800 --> 2:36:37.100\n He would say that Stalin was a symptom of atheism\n\n2:36:37.100 --> 2:36:37.940\n and that's not at all.\n\n2:36:37.940 --> 2:36:40.340\n I mean, it's not my kind of atheism.\n\n2:36:40.340 --> 2:36:43.980\n Stalin, the problem with the Gulag\n\n2:36:43.980 --> 2:36:48.180\n and the experiment with communism or with Stalinism\n\n2:36:49.180 --> 2:36:53.180\n or with Nazism was not that there was so much\n\n2:36:53.180 --> 2:36:56.740\n scientific rigor and self criticism and honesty\n\n2:36:56.740 --> 2:37:01.740\n and introspection and judicious use of psychedelics.\n\n2:37:03.060 --> 2:37:07.300\n I mean, that was not the problem in Hitler's Germany\n\n2:37:07.300 --> 2:37:10.220\n or in Stalin's Soviet Union.\n\n2:37:12.700 --> 2:37:16.780\n The problem was you have other ideas\n\n2:37:16.780 --> 2:37:21.780\n that capture a similar kind of mob based dogmatic energy.\n\n2:37:23.420 --> 2:37:28.060\n And yes, the results of all of that\n\n2:37:28.060 --> 2:37:30.540\n are predictably murderous.\n\n2:37:30.540 --> 2:37:33.500\n Well, the question is what is the source\n\n2:37:33.500 --> 2:37:37.780\n of the most viral and sticky stories\n\n2:37:37.780 --> 2:37:40.300\n that ultimately lead to a positive outcome?\n\n2:37:40.300 --> 2:37:43.380\n So communism was, I mean, having grown up\n\n2:37:43.380 --> 2:37:48.380\n in the Soviet Union, even still having relatives in Russia,\n\n2:37:51.480 --> 2:37:53.940\n there's a stickiness to the nationalism\n\n2:37:53.940 --> 2:37:56.660\n and to the ideologies of communism\n\n2:37:56.660 --> 2:38:00.320\n that religious or not, you could say it's religious forever.\n\n2:38:00.320 --> 2:38:05.320\n I could just say it's stories that are viral and sticky.\n\n2:38:06.900 --> 2:38:08.960\n I'm using the most horrible words,\n\n2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:12.340\n but the question is whether science and reason\n\n2:38:12.340 --> 2:38:14.440\n can generate viral sticky stories\n\n2:38:14.440 --> 2:38:16.340\n that give meaning to people's lives.\n\n2:38:18.280 --> 2:38:19.700\n And your sense is it does.\n\n2:38:20.740 --> 2:38:25.740\n Well, whatever is true ultimately should be captivating.\n\n2:38:25.740 --> 2:38:30.740\n It's like what's more captivating than whatever is real?\n\n2:38:34.420 --> 2:38:39.420\n Because reality is, again, we're just climbing\n\n2:38:39.620 --> 2:38:42.160\n out of the darkness in terms of our understanding\n\n2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:43.080\n of what the hell is going on.\n\n2:38:43.080 --> 2:38:47.380\n And there's no telling what spooky things\n\n2:38:47.380 --> 2:38:48.340\n may in fact be true.\n\n2:38:48.340 --> 2:38:49.980\n I mean, I don't know if you've been on the receiving end\n\n2:38:49.980 --> 2:38:54.100\n of recent rumors about our conversation\n\n2:38:54.100 --> 2:38:57.660\n about UFOs very likely changing in the near term, right?\n\n2:38:57.660 --> 2:39:00.180\n But like there was just a Washington Post article\n\n2:39:00.180 --> 2:39:01.380\n and a New Yorker article,\n\n2:39:01.380 --> 2:39:04.500\n and I've received some private outreach\n\n2:39:04.500 --> 2:39:08.140\n and perhaps you have, I know other people in our orbit\n\n2:39:08.140 --> 2:39:11.660\n have people who are claiming\n\n2:39:11.660 --> 2:39:14.700\n that the government has known much more about UFOs\n\n2:39:14.700 --> 2:39:17.620\n than they have let on until now.\n\n2:39:17.620 --> 2:39:19.900\n And this conversation is actually is about\n\n2:39:19.900 --> 2:39:21.740\n to become more prominent,\n\n2:39:21.740 --> 2:39:25.380\n and it's not gonna be whatever,\n\n2:39:26.400 --> 2:39:28.540\n whoever's left standing when the music stops,\n\n2:39:28.540 --> 2:39:33.540\n it's not going to be a comfortable position to be in\n\n2:39:34.060 --> 2:39:38.580\n as a super rigorous scientific skeptic\n\n2:39:40.060 --> 2:39:41.660\n who's been saying there's no there there\n\n2:39:41.660 --> 2:39:43.560\n for the last 75 years, right?\n\n2:39:45.780 --> 2:39:49.100\n The short version is it sounds like\n\n2:39:49.100 --> 2:39:52.340\n the Office of Naval Intelligence and the Pentagon\n\n2:39:52.340 --> 2:39:55.620\n are very likely to say to Congress at some point\n\n2:39:55.620 --> 2:39:58.940\n in the not too distant future that we have evidence\n\n2:39:58.940 --> 2:40:02.820\n that there is technology flying around here\n\n2:40:02.820 --> 2:40:07.820\n that seems like it can't possibly be of human origin, right?\n\n2:40:08.580 --> 2:40:10.060\n Now, I don't know what I'm gonna do\n\n2:40:10.060 --> 2:40:11.360\n with that kind of disclosure, right?\n\n2:40:11.360 --> 2:40:14.640\n Maybe it's gonna be nothing,\n\n2:40:14.640 --> 2:40:17.280\n no follow on conversation to really have,\n\n2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:21.820\n but that is such a powerfully strange circumstance\n\n2:40:21.820 --> 2:40:22.940\n to be in, right?\n\n2:40:22.940 --> 2:40:25.420\n I mean, it's just, what are we gonna do with that?\n\n2:40:25.420 --> 2:40:27.500\n If in fact, that's what happens, right?\n\n2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:31.700\n If in fact, the considered opinion,\n\n2:40:31.700 --> 2:40:35.000\n despite the embarrassment it causes them\n\n2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:38.500\n of the US government, of all of our intelligence,\n\n2:40:38.500 --> 2:40:40.380\n all of the relevant intelligence services\n\n2:40:40.380 --> 2:40:44.100\n is that this isn't a hoax.\n\n2:40:44.100 --> 2:40:46.980\n It's too much data to suggest that it's a hoax.\n\n2:40:46.980 --> 2:40:48.740\n We've got too much radar imagery,\n\n2:40:48.740 --> 2:40:51.180\n there's too much satellite data,\n\n2:40:51.180 --> 2:40:55.520\n whatever data they actually have, there's too much of it.\n\n2:40:55.520 --> 2:40:58.660\n All we can say now is something's going on\n\n2:40:58.660 --> 2:41:03.620\n and there's no way it's the Chinese or the Russians\n\n2:41:03.620 --> 2:41:06.100\n or anyone else's technology.\n\n2:41:09.020 --> 2:41:12.680\n That should arrest our attention collectively\n\n2:41:12.680 --> 2:41:15.720\n to a degree that nothing in our lifetime has.\n\n2:41:15.720 --> 2:41:19.460\n And now one worries that we're so jaded\n\n2:41:21.100 --> 2:41:23.220\n and confused and distracted\n\n2:41:23.220 --> 2:41:28.140\n that it's gonna get much less coverage\n\n2:41:28.140 --> 2:41:33.140\n than Obama's tan suit did a bunch of years ago.\n\n2:41:37.060 --> 2:41:38.460\n Who knows how we'll respond to that?\n\n2:41:38.460 --> 2:41:41.460\n But it's just to say that the need for us\n\n2:41:41.460 --> 2:41:46.460\n to tell ourselves an honest story about what's going on\n\n2:41:50.100 --> 2:41:51.980\n and what's likely to happen next\n\n2:41:51.980 --> 2:41:54.020\n is never gonna go away, right?\n\n2:41:54.020 --> 2:41:58.380\n And it's important, it's just the division between me\n\n2:41:58.380 --> 2:42:00.820\n and every person who's defending traditional religion\n\n2:42:00.820 --> 2:42:05.820\n is where is it that you wanna lie to yourself\n\n2:42:07.660 --> 2:42:09.060\n or lie to your kids?\n\n2:42:09.060 --> 2:42:11.380\n Like where is honesty a liability?\n\n2:42:11.380 --> 2:42:16.380\n And for me, I've yet to find the place where it is.\n\n2:42:17.140 --> 2:42:20.980\n And it's so obviously a strength\n\n2:42:21.840 --> 2:42:24.140\n in almost every other circumstance\n\n2:42:24.140 --> 2:42:28.100\n because it is the thing that allows you to course correct.\n\n2:42:28.100 --> 2:42:33.020\n It is the thing that allows you to hope at least\n\n2:42:33.020 --> 2:42:34.780\n that your beliefs, that your stories\n\n2:42:34.780 --> 2:42:37.260\n are in some kind of calibration\n\n2:42:37.260 --> 2:42:40.400\n with what's actually going on in the world.\n\n2:42:40.400 --> 2:42:42.260\n Yeah, it is a little bit sad to imagine\n\n2:42:42.260 --> 2:42:47.260\n that if aliens on mass showed up to Earth,\n\n2:42:47.340 --> 2:42:50.540\n they would be too preoccupied with political bickering\n\n2:42:50.540 --> 2:42:53.220\n or to like these like fake news\n\n2:42:53.220 --> 2:42:56.180\n and all that kind of stuff to notice\n\n2:42:56.180 --> 2:42:59.540\n the very basic evidence of reality.\n\n2:42:59.540 --> 2:43:02.420\n I do have a glimmer of hope\n\n2:43:02.420 --> 2:43:06.460\n that there seems to be more and more hunger for authenticity.\n\n2:43:06.460 --> 2:43:08.500\n And I feel like that opens the door\n\n2:43:08.500 --> 2:43:13.500\n for a hunger for what is real.\n\n2:43:14.020 --> 2:43:15.820\n Like people don't want stories.\n\n2:43:15.820 --> 2:43:19.660\n They don't want like layers and layers of like fakeness.\n\n2:43:20.860 --> 2:43:24.760\n And I'm hoping that means that will directly lead\n\n2:43:24.760 --> 2:43:28.500\n to a greater hunger for reality and reason and truth.\n\n2:43:28.500 --> 2:43:31.460\n Truth isn't dogmatism.\n\n2:43:31.460 --> 2:43:34.200\n Like truth isn't authority.\n\n2:43:34.200 --> 2:43:37.060\n I have a PhD and therefore I'm right.\n\n2:43:37.060 --> 2:43:42.060\n Truth is almost, like the reality is\n\n2:43:42.580 --> 2:43:44.460\n there's so many questions, there's so many mysteries,\n\n2:43:44.460 --> 2:43:45.480\n there's so much uncertainty.\n\n2:43:45.480 --> 2:43:49.380\n This is our best available, like a best guess.\n\n2:43:49.380 --> 2:43:52.080\n And we have a lot of evidence that supports that guess,\n\n2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:53.820\n but it could be so many other things.\n\n2:43:53.820 --> 2:43:56.380\n And like just even conveying that,\n\n2:43:56.380 --> 2:43:58.800\n I think there's a hunger for that in the world\n\n2:43:58.800 --> 2:44:01.440\n to hear that from scientists, less dogmatism\n\n2:44:01.440 --> 2:44:04.940\n and more just like this is what we know.\n\n2:44:04.940 --> 2:44:07.900\n We're doing our best given the uncertainty, given,\n\n2:44:07.900 --> 2:44:10.660\n I mean, this is true with obviously with the virology\n\n2:44:10.660 --> 2:44:11.860\n and all those kinds of things\n\n2:44:11.860 --> 2:44:13.380\n because everything is happening so fast.\n\n2:44:13.380 --> 2:44:16.520\n There's a lot of, and biology is super messy.\n\n2:44:16.520 --> 2:44:18.860\n So it's very hard to know stuff for sure.\n\n2:44:18.860 --> 2:44:21.020\n So just being open and real about that,\n\n2:44:21.020 --> 2:44:25.660\n I think I'm hoping will change people's hunger\n\n2:44:25.660 --> 2:44:29.540\n and openness and trust of what's real.\n\n2:44:29.540 --> 2:44:31.860\n Yeah, well, so much of this is probabilistic.\n\n2:44:31.860 --> 2:44:35.060\n I mean, so much of what can seem dogmatic scientifically\n\n2:44:35.060 --> 2:44:40.060\n is just you're placing a bet on whether it's worth\n\n2:44:42.420 --> 2:44:45.540\n reading that paper or rethinking your presuppositions\n\n2:44:45.540 --> 2:44:46.740\n on that point.\n\n2:44:46.740 --> 2:44:49.960\n It's like, it's not a fundamental closure to data.\n\n2:44:49.960 --> 2:44:52.740\n It's just that there's so much data on one side\n\n2:44:52.740 --> 2:44:55.580\n or so much would have to change\n\n2:44:55.580 --> 2:44:57.800\n in terms of your understanding of what you think\n\n2:44:57.800 --> 2:44:59.940\n you'll understand about the nature of the world\n\n2:44:59.940 --> 2:45:04.940\n if this new fact were so that you can pretty quickly say,\n\n2:45:06.140 --> 2:45:08.780\n all right, that's probably bullshit, right?\n\n2:45:08.780 --> 2:45:12.420\n And it can sound like a fundamental closure\n\n2:45:12.420 --> 2:45:17.420\n to new conversations, new evidence, new data, new argument,\n\n2:45:17.420 --> 2:45:18.820\n but it's really not.\n\n2:45:18.820 --> 2:45:21.340\n It's just, it really is just triaging your attention.\n\n2:45:21.340 --> 2:45:23.560\n It's just like, okay, you're telling me\n\n2:45:23.560 --> 2:45:27.220\n that your best friend can actually read minds.\n\n2:45:27.220 --> 2:45:30.840\n Okay, well, that's interesting.\n\n2:45:30.840 --> 2:45:33.060\n Let me know when that person has gone into a lab\n\n2:45:33.060 --> 2:45:34.140\n and actually proven it, right?\n\n2:45:34.140 --> 2:45:36.700\n Like, I don't need, like, this is not the place\n\n2:45:36.700 --> 2:45:38.540\n where I need to spend the rest of my day\n\n2:45:38.540 --> 2:45:42.440\n figuring out if your buddy can read my mind, right?\n\n2:45:42.440 --> 2:45:44.700\n But there's a way to communicate that.\n\n2:45:44.700 --> 2:45:46.980\n I think it does too often sound\n\n2:45:46.980 --> 2:45:48.860\n like you're completely closed off to ideas\n\n2:45:48.860 --> 2:45:52.740\n as opposed to saying like, this is, you know,\n\n2:45:52.740 --> 2:45:56.060\n as opposed to saying that there's a lot of evidence\n\n2:45:56.060 --> 2:46:00.140\n in support of this, but you're still open minded\n\n2:46:00.140 --> 2:46:00.980\n to other ideas.\n\n2:46:00.980 --> 2:46:02.400\n Like, there's a way to communicate that.\n\n2:46:02.400 --> 2:46:04.620\n It's not necessarily even with words.\n\n2:46:04.620 --> 2:46:08.100\n It's like, it's even that Joe Rogan energy\n\n2:46:08.100 --> 2:46:10.460\n of it's entirely possible.\n\n2:46:10.460 --> 2:46:12.700\n Just, it's that energy of being open minded\n\n2:46:12.700 --> 2:46:14.280\n and curious like kids are.\n\n2:46:14.280 --> 2:46:16.460\n Like, this is our best understanding,\n\n2:46:16.460 --> 2:46:19.100\n but you still are curious.\n\n2:46:19.100 --> 2:46:22.700\n I'm not saying allocate time to exploring all those things,\n\n2:46:22.700 --> 2:46:24.500\n but still leaving the door open.\n\n2:46:24.500 --> 2:46:27.060\n And there's a way to communicate that, I think,\n\n2:46:27.060 --> 2:46:31.500\n that people really hunger for.\n\n2:46:31.500 --> 2:46:32.660\n Let me ask you this.\n\n2:46:32.660 --> 2:46:35.180\n I've been recently talking a lot with John Donahoe\n\n2:46:35.180 --> 2:46:37.220\n from Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fame.\n\n2:46:37.220 --> 2:46:39.200\n I don't know if you know who that is.\n\n2:46:39.200 --> 2:46:40.500\n In fact, I'm talking about somebody\n\n2:46:40.500 --> 2:46:41.620\n who's good at what he does.\n\n2:46:41.620 --> 2:46:42.700\n Yeah.\n\n2:46:42.700 --> 2:46:45.540\n And he, speaking of somebody who's open minded,\n\n2:46:45.540 --> 2:46:48.060\n the reason he's doing this ridiculous transition\n\n2:46:48.060 --> 2:46:50.340\n is for the longest time, and even still,\n\n2:46:50.340 --> 2:46:52.640\n a lot of people believed in the Jiu Jitsu world\n\n2:46:52.640 --> 2:46:55.260\n and grappling world that leg locks\n\n2:46:55.260 --> 2:46:56.620\n are not effective in Jiu Jitsu.\n\n2:46:56.620 --> 2:46:59.140\n And he was somebody that inspired\n\n2:46:59.140 --> 2:47:01.860\n by the open mindedness of Dean Lister,\n\n2:47:01.860 --> 2:47:05.340\n famously to him said, why do you only consider\n\n2:47:05.340 --> 2:47:08.540\n half the human body when you're trying to do the submissions?\n\n2:47:08.540 --> 2:47:10.380\n He developed an entire system\n\n2:47:10.380 --> 2:47:12.460\n on this other half the human body.\n\n2:47:12.460 --> 2:47:15.900\n Anyway, I do that absurd transition to ask you,\n\n2:47:15.900 --> 2:47:20.100\n because you're also a student of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.\n\n2:47:20.100 --> 2:47:22.100\n Is there something you could say\n\n2:47:22.100 --> 2:47:23.780\n how that has affected your life,\n\n2:47:23.780 --> 2:47:27.940\n what you've learned from grappling from the martial arts?\n\n2:47:27.940 --> 2:47:29.300\n Well, it's actually a great transition\n\n2:47:29.300 --> 2:47:33.900\n because I think one of the things\n\n2:47:33.900 --> 2:47:35.660\n that's so beautiful about Jiu Jitsu\n\n2:47:35.660 --> 2:47:39.500\n is that it does what we wish we could do\n\n2:47:39.500 --> 2:47:41.940\n in every other area of life\n\n2:47:41.940 --> 2:47:43.800\n where we're talking about this difference\n\n2:47:43.800 --> 2:47:46.880\n between knowledge and ignorance, right?\n\n2:47:46.880 --> 2:47:51.700\n Like there's no room for bullshit, right?\n\n2:47:51.700 --> 2:47:53.860\n You don't get any credit for bullshit.\n\n2:47:53.860 --> 2:47:56.580\n There's the difference,\n\n2:47:56.580 --> 2:47:59.020\n the amazing thing about Jiu Jitsu is that\n\n2:47:59.020 --> 2:48:03.260\n the difference between knowing what's going on\n\n2:48:03.260 --> 2:48:04.980\n and what to do and not knowing it\n\n2:48:04.980 --> 2:48:08.060\n is as the gulf between those two states\n\n2:48:08.060 --> 2:48:12.580\n is as wide as it is in any thing in human life.\n\n2:48:14.500 --> 2:48:19.000\n And it's spanned, it can be spanned so quickly.\n\n2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:22.300\n Like each increment of knowledge\n\n2:48:22.300 --> 2:48:24.700\n can be doled out in five minutes.\n\n2:48:24.700 --> 2:48:27.480\n It's like, here's the thing that got you killed\n\n2:48:27.480 --> 2:48:30.940\n and here's how to prevent it from happening to you\n\n2:48:30.940 --> 2:48:32.780\n and here's how to do it to others.\n\n2:48:32.780 --> 2:48:37.020\n And you just get this amazing cadence\n\n2:48:37.020 --> 2:48:40.220\n of discovering your fatal ignorance\n\n2:48:40.220 --> 2:48:44.460\n and then having it remedied with the actual technique.\n\n2:48:46.100 --> 2:48:48.100\n And I mean, just for people\n\n2:48:48.100 --> 2:48:49.020\n who don't know what we're talking about,\n\n2:48:49.020 --> 2:48:51.220\n it's just like this, the simple circumstance\n\n2:48:51.220 --> 2:48:53.020\n of like someone's got you in a headlock,\n\n2:48:53.020 --> 2:48:54.820\n how do you get out of that, right?\n\n2:48:54.820 --> 2:48:56.780\n Someone's sitting on your chest\n\n2:48:56.780 --> 2:48:59.020\n and they're in the mount position\n\n2:48:59.020 --> 2:49:01.660\n and you're on the bottom and you wanna get away,\n\n2:49:01.660 --> 2:49:02.940\n how do you get them off you?\n\n2:49:02.940 --> 2:49:03.940\n They're sitting on you.\n\n2:49:04.900 --> 2:49:08.300\n Your intuitions about how to do this are terrible\n\n2:49:08.300 --> 2:49:10.820\n even if you've done some other martial art, right?\n\n2:49:10.820 --> 2:49:13.060\n And once you learn how to do it,\n\n2:49:14.420 --> 2:49:16.100\n the difference is night and day.\n\n2:49:16.100 --> 2:49:19.100\n It's like you have access to a completely different physics.\n\n2:49:21.140 --> 2:49:26.140\n But I think our understanding of the world\n\n2:49:26.260 --> 2:49:30.220\n can be much more like jujitsu than it tends to be, right?\n\n2:49:30.220 --> 2:49:35.220\n And I think we should all have a much better sense\n\n2:49:35.740 --> 2:49:40.740\n of when we should tap out\n\n2:49:40.740 --> 2:49:45.740\n and when we should recognize that our epistemological arm\n\n2:49:47.420 --> 2:49:50.100\n is barred and now it's being broken, right?\n\n2:49:50.100 --> 2:49:53.540\n And the problem with debating most other topics\n\n2:49:53.540 --> 2:49:57.060\n is that most people, it isn't jujitsu\n\n2:49:57.060 --> 2:49:59.260\n and most people don't tap out, right?\n\n2:49:59.260 --> 2:50:02.340\n Even if it's obvious to you they're wrong\n\n2:50:02.340 --> 2:50:04.460\n and it's obvious to an intelligent audience\n\n2:50:04.460 --> 2:50:06.800\n that they're wrong, people just double down\n\n2:50:06.800 --> 2:50:08.700\n and double down and they're either lying\n\n2:50:08.700 --> 2:50:09.780\n or lying to themselves\n\n2:50:09.780 --> 2:50:13.780\n or they're bluffing and so you have a lot of zombies\n\n2:50:13.780 --> 2:50:16.140\n walking around and zombie worldviews walking around\n\n2:50:16.140 --> 2:50:19.800\n which have been disconfirmed as emphatically\n\n2:50:19.800 --> 2:50:21.780\n as someone gets armbarred, right?\n\n2:50:21.780 --> 2:50:24.540\n Or someone gets choked out in jujitsu\n\n2:50:24.540 --> 2:50:27.220\n but because it's not jujitsu,\n\n2:50:29.420 --> 2:50:30.900\n they can live to fight another day, right?\n\n2:50:30.900 --> 2:50:32.940\n Or they can pretend that they didn't lose\n\n2:50:32.940 --> 2:50:34.660\n that particular argument.\n\n2:50:34.660 --> 2:50:38.140\n And science when it works is a lot like jujitsu.\n\n2:50:38.140 --> 2:50:41.260\n I mean, science when you falsify a thesis, right?\n\n2:50:41.260 --> 2:50:44.220\n When you think DNA is one way\n\n2:50:44.220 --> 2:50:46.020\n and it proves to be another way,\n\n2:50:46.020 --> 2:50:49.420\n when you think it's triple stranded or whatever,\n\n2:50:49.420 --> 2:50:51.980\n it's like there is a there there\n\n2:50:51.980 --> 2:50:55.440\n and you can get to a real consensus.\n\n2:50:56.800 --> 2:51:01.020\n So jujitsu for me, it was more than just\n\n2:51:02.020 --> 2:51:06.220\n of interest for self defense and the sport of it.\n\n2:51:06.220 --> 2:51:08.980\n It was just, there was something, it's a language\n\n2:51:08.980 --> 2:51:11.860\n and an argument you're having\n\n2:51:11.860 --> 2:51:16.860\n where you can't fool yourself anymore.\n\n2:51:18.900 --> 2:51:23.740\n First of all, it cancels any role of luck\n\n2:51:23.740 --> 2:51:27.500\n in a way that most other athletic feats don't.\n\n2:51:27.500 --> 2:51:29.040\n It's like in basketball,\n\n2:51:29.040 --> 2:51:30.220\n even if you're not good at basketball,\n\n2:51:30.220 --> 2:51:31.880\n you can take the basketball in your hand,\n\n2:51:31.880 --> 2:51:36.300\n you can be 75 feet away and hurl it at the basket\n\n2:51:36.300 --> 2:51:37.620\n and you might make it.\n\n2:51:37.620 --> 2:51:40.820\n And you could convince yourself based on that demonstration\n\n2:51:40.820 --> 2:51:43.260\n that you have some kind of talent for basketball, right?\n\n2:51:43.260 --> 2:51:45.140\n Enough, 10 minutes on the mat\n\n2:51:45.140 --> 2:51:50.140\n with a real jujitsu practitioner when you're not one\n\n2:51:50.980 --> 2:51:52.620\n proves to you that you just, there is,\n\n2:51:52.620 --> 2:51:54.700\n it's not like, there's no lucky punch.\n\n2:51:54.700 --> 2:51:56.740\n There's no, you're not gonna get a lucky,\n\n2:51:56.740 --> 2:51:59.140\n there's no lucky rear naked choke you're gonna perform\n\n2:51:59.140 --> 2:52:02.860\n on someone who's Marcelo Garcia or somebody.\n\n2:52:02.860 --> 2:52:05.300\n It's just, it's not gonna happen.\n\n2:52:05.300 --> 2:52:10.300\n And having that aspect of the usual range of uncertainty\n\n2:52:14.900 --> 2:52:19.220\n and self deception and bullshit just stripped away\n\n2:52:19.220 --> 2:52:21.900\n was really a kind of revelation.\n\n2:52:21.900 --> 2:52:24.140\n It was just an amazing experience.\n\n2:52:24.140 --> 2:52:25.460\n Yeah, I think it's a really powerful thing\n\n2:52:25.460 --> 2:52:28.260\n that accompanies whatever other pursuit you have in life.\n\n2:52:28.260 --> 2:52:31.340\n I'm not sure if there's anything like jujitsu\n\n2:52:31.340 --> 2:52:35.340\n where you could just systematically go into a place\n\n2:52:35.340 --> 2:52:38.940\n where you're, that's honest,\n\n2:52:38.940 --> 2:52:41.260\n where your beliefs get challenged\n\n2:52:41.260 --> 2:52:43.220\n in a way that's conclusive.\n\n2:52:43.220 --> 2:52:44.060\n Yeah.\n\n2:52:44.060 --> 2:52:45.380\n I haven't found too many other mechanism,\n\n2:52:45.380 --> 2:52:49.060\n which is why it's a, we had this earlier question\n\n2:52:49.060 --> 2:52:51.840\n about fame and ego and so on.\n\n2:52:52.820 --> 2:52:56.340\n I'm very much rely on jujitsu in my own life\n\n2:52:56.340 --> 2:53:00.380\n as a place where I can always go to have my ego in check.\n\n2:53:00.380 --> 2:53:05.380\n And that has effects on how I live\n\n2:53:05.560 --> 2:53:07.560\n every other aspect of my life.\n\n2:53:07.560 --> 2:53:10.340\n Actually, even just doing any kind of,\n\n2:53:10.340 --> 2:53:13.080\n for me personally, physical challenges,\n\n2:53:13.080 --> 2:53:15.980\n like even running, doing something that's way too hard\n\n2:53:15.980 --> 2:53:19.160\n for me and then pushing through, that's somehow humbling.\n\n2:53:19.160 --> 2:53:20.980\n Some people talk about nature being humbling\n\n2:53:20.980 --> 2:53:25.980\n in that kind of sense, where you kind of see something\n\n2:53:27.460 --> 2:53:29.760\n really powerful, like the ocean.\n\n2:53:29.760 --> 2:53:31.900\n Like if you go surfing and you realize\n\n2:53:31.900 --> 2:53:33.700\n there's something much more powerful than you,\n\n2:53:33.700 --> 2:53:38.100\n that's also honest, that there's no way to,\n\n2:53:38.100 --> 2:53:39.620\n that you're just like the speck,\n\n2:53:39.620 --> 2:53:43.100\n that kind of puts you in the right scale\n\n2:53:43.100 --> 2:53:45.640\n of where you are in this world.\n\n2:53:45.640 --> 2:53:48.700\n And jujitsu does that better than anything else for me.\n\n2:53:48.700 --> 2:53:52.700\n But we should say it's only within its frame\n\n2:53:52.700 --> 2:53:57.180\n is it truly the final right answer\n\n2:53:57.180 --> 2:53:58.840\n to all the problems it solves.\n\n2:53:58.840 --> 2:54:02.060\n Because if you just put jujitsu into an MMA frame\n\n2:54:02.060 --> 2:54:05.040\n or a total self defense frame,\n\n2:54:05.040 --> 2:54:08.440\n then there's a lot of unpleasant surprises\n\n2:54:08.440 --> 2:54:09.880\n to discover there, right?\n\n2:54:09.880 --> 2:54:12.100\n Like somebody who thinks all you need is jujitsu\n\n2:54:12.100 --> 2:54:16.900\n to win the UFC gets punched in the face a lot.\n\n2:54:16.900 --> 2:54:20.220\n Even from, even on the ground.\n\n2:54:20.220 --> 2:54:23.220\n So it's, and then you bring weapons in,\n\n2:54:23.220 --> 2:54:24.980\n it's like when you talk to jujitsu people\n\n2:54:24.980 --> 2:54:28.360\n about knife defense and self defense, right?\n\n2:54:28.360 --> 2:54:32.640\n Like that opens the door to certain kinds of delusions.\n\n2:54:32.640 --> 2:54:37.000\n But the analogy to martial arts is fascinating\n\n2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:41.940\n because on the other side, we have endless testimony now\n\n2:54:41.940 --> 2:54:45.740\n of fake martial arts that don't seem to know they're fake\n\n2:54:45.740 --> 2:54:49.620\n and are as delusional, I mean, they're impossibly delusional.\n\n2:54:49.620 --> 2:54:51.700\n I mean, there's great video of Joe Rogan\n\n2:54:51.700 --> 2:54:53.300\n watching some of these videos\n\n2:54:53.300 --> 2:54:55.860\n because people send them to him all the time.\n\n2:54:55.860 --> 2:54:57.300\n But like literally there are people,\n\n2:54:57.300 --> 2:54:59.060\n there are people who clearly believe in magic\n\n2:54:59.060 --> 2:55:01.420\n where the master isn't even touching the students\n\n2:55:01.420 --> 2:55:02.980\n and they're flopping over.\n\n2:55:02.980 --> 2:55:06.060\n So there's this kind of shared delusion\n\n2:55:06.060 --> 2:55:09.500\n which you would think maybe is just a performance\n\n2:55:09.500 --> 2:55:11.300\n and it's all a kind of elaborate fraud.\n\n2:55:11.300 --> 2:55:13.900\n But there are cases where the people,\n\n2:55:13.900 --> 2:55:16.620\n I mean, there's one fairly famous case\n\n2:55:16.620 --> 2:55:18.940\n if you're a connoisseur of this madness\n\n2:55:19.860 --> 2:55:21.580\n where this old older martial artist\n\n2:55:21.580 --> 2:55:25.620\n who you saw flipping his students endlessly by magic\n\n2:55:25.620 --> 2:55:27.700\n without touching them issued a challenge\n\n2:55:27.700 --> 2:55:30.420\n to the wide world of martial artists.\n\n2:55:30.420 --> 2:55:34.260\n And someone showed up and just punched him in the face\n\n2:55:34.260 --> 2:55:35.280\n until it was over.\n\n2:55:36.420 --> 2:55:40.980\n Clearly he believed his own publicity at some point, right?\n\n2:55:40.980 --> 2:55:45.580\n And so it's this amazing metaphor.\n\n2:55:45.580 --> 2:55:47.660\n It seems, again, it should be impossible,\n\n2:55:47.660 --> 2:55:49.500\n but if that's possible,\n\n2:55:49.500 --> 2:55:52.580\n nothing we see under the guise of religion\n\n2:55:52.580 --> 2:55:57.580\n or political bias or even scientific bias\n\n2:55:58.260 --> 2:55:59.700\n should be surprising to us.\n\n2:55:59.700 --> 2:56:02.540\n I mean, it's so easy to see the work\n\n2:56:02.540 --> 2:56:05.740\n that cognitive bias is doing for people\n\n2:56:05.740 --> 2:56:09.180\n when you can get someone who is ready\n\n2:56:09.180 --> 2:56:11.580\n to issue a challenge to the world\n\n2:56:11.580 --> 2:56:13.980\n who thinks he's got magic powers.\n\n2:56:13.980 --> 2:56:17.540\n Yeah, that's a human nature on clear display.\n\n2:56:17.540 --> 2:56:20.460\n Let me ask you about love, Mr. Sam Harris.\n\n2:56:20.460 --> 2:56:22.060\n You did an episode of Making Sense\n\n2:56:22.060 --> 2:56:24.740\n with your wife, Annika Harris.\n\n2:56:24.740 --> 2:56:26.780\n That was very entertaining to listen to.\n\n2:56:29.420 --> 2:56:33.020\n What role does love play in your life\n\n2:56:33.020 --> 2:56:34.760\n or in a life well lived?\n\n2:56:36.700 --> 2:56:38.580\n Again, asking from an engineering perspective\n\n2:56:38.580 --> 2:56:39.420\n or AI systems.\n\n2:56:39.420 --> 2:56:40.260\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:56:40.260 --> 2:56:45.140\n I mean, it is something that we should want to build\n\n2:56:45.140 --> 2:56:48.020\n into our powerful machines.\n\n2:56:48.020 --> 2:56:52.860\n I mean, love at bottom is,\n\n2:56:52.860 --> 2:56:55.520\n people can mean many things by love, I think.\n\n2:56:55.520 --> 2:56:58.980\n I think that what we should mean by it most of the time\n\n2:56:58.980 --> 2:57:03.980\n is a deep commitment to the wellbeing of those we love.\n\n2:57:05.100 --> 2:57:06.980\n I mean, your love is synonymous\n\n2:57:06.980 --> 2:57:09.500\n with really wanting the other person to be happy\n\n2:57:09.500 --> 2:57:11.500\n and even wanting to,\n\n2:57:11.500 --> 2:57:13.540\n and being made happy by their happiness\n\n2:57:13.540 --> 2:57:15.500\n and being made happy in their presence.\n\n2:57:15.500 --> 2:57:20.500\n So at bottom, you're on the same team emotionally,\n\n2:57:21.060 --> 2:57:24.440\n even when you might be disagreeing more superficially\n\n2:57:24.440 --> 2:57:26.840\n about something or trying to negotiate something.\n\n2:57:26.840 --> 2:57:31.840\n It's just, it can't be zero sum in any important sense\n\n2:57:31.840 --> 2:57:36.840\n for love to actually be manifest in that moment.\n\n2:57:37.520 --> 2:57:40.040\n See, I have a different, just sorry to interrupt.\n\n2:57:40.040 --> 2:57:42.480\n I have a sense, I don't know if you've ever seen\n\n2:57:42.480 --> 2:57:43.720\n March of the Penguins.\n\n2:57:44.600 --> 2:57:49.480\n My view of love is like, it's like a cold wind is blowing.\n\n2:57:49.480 --> 2:57:52.880\n It's like this terrible suffering that's all around us.\n\n2:57:52.880 --> 2:57:56.720\n And love is like the huddling of the two penguins for warmth.\n\n2:57:56.720 --> 2:57:59.140\n It's not necessarily that you're like,\n\n2:57:59.140 --> 2:58:02.320\n you're basically escaping the cruelty of life\n\n2:58:02.320 --> 2:58:06.520\n by together for time living in an illusion\n\n2:58:06.520 --> 2:58:10.540\n of some kind of the magic of human connection,\n\n2:58:10.540 --> 2:58:13.000\n that social connection that we have\n\n2:58:13.000 --> 2:58:15.160\n that kind of grows with time\n\n2:58:15.160 --> 2:58:20.160\n as we're surrounded by basically the absurdity of life\n\n2:58:21.440 --> 2:58:23.620\n or the suffering of life.\n\n2:58:23.620 --> 2:58:25.920\n That's my penguins view of love.\n\n2:58:25.920 --> 2:58:29.680\n There is that too, I mean, there is the warmth component.\n\n2:58:29.680 --> 2:58:32.200\n Like you're made happy by your connection\n\n2:58:32.200 --> 2:58:34.520\n with the person you love.\n\n2:58:34.520 --> 2:58:39.080\n Otherwise you wouldn't be compelling.\n\n2:58:39.080 --> 2:58:42.040\n So it's not that you have two different modes,\n\n2:58:42.040 --> 2:58:44.000\n you want them to be happy\n\n2:58:44.000 --> 2:58:45.440\n and then you wanna be happy yourself\n\n2:58:45.440 --> 2:58:48.200\n and those are not, those are just like\n\n2:58:48.200 --> 2:58:49.520\n two separate games you're playing.\n\n2:58:49.520 --> 2:58:52.420\n No, it's like you found someone who,\n\n2:58:52.420 --> 2:58:57.420\n you have a positive social feeling.\n\n2:58:58.980 --> 2:59:01.660\n I mean, again, love doesn't have to be as personal\n\n2:59:01.660 --> 2:59:02.900\n as it tends to be for us.\n\n2:59:02.900 --> 2:59:04.100\n I mean, it's like there's personal love,\n\n2:59:04.100 --> 2:59:08.740\n there's your actual spouse or your family or your friends,\n\n2:59:08.740 --> 2:59:11.980\n but potentially you could feel love for strangers\n\n2:59:11.980 --> 2:59:16.460\n in so far as that your wish that they not suffer\n\n2:59:16.460 --> 2:59:18.500\n and that their hopes and dreams be realized\n\n2:59:18.500 --> 2:59:20.420\n becomes palpable to you.\n\n2:59:20.420 --> 2:59:22.380\n I mean, like you can actually feel\n\n2:59:26.260 --> 2:59:29.260\n just reflexive joy at the joy of others.\n\n2:59:29.260 --> 2:59:30.940\n When you see someone's face,\n\n2:59:30.940 --> 2:59:33.740\n a total stranger's face light up in happiness,\n\n2:59:33.740 --> 2:59:36.660\n that can become more and more contagious to you\n\n2:59:36.660 --> 2:59:39.180\n and it can become so contagious to you\n\n2:59:39.180 --> 2:59:42.180\n that you really feel permeated by it.\n\n2:59:42.180 --> 2:59:44.940\n And it's just like, so it really is not zero sum.\n\n2:59:44.940 --> 2:59:48.820\n When you see someone else succeed and they're,\n\n2:59:48.820 --> 2:59:52.020\n the light bulb of joy goes off over their head,\n\n2:59:52.020 --> 2:59:54.700\n you feel the analogous joy for them.\n\n2:59:54.700 --> 2:59:57.740\n And it's not just, and you're no longer keeping score,\n\n2:59:57.740 --> 3:00:00.340\n you're no longer feeling diminished by their success.\n\n3:00:00.340 --> 3:00:03.340\n It's just like that's, their success becomes your success\n\n3:00:03.340 --> 3:00:05.420\n because you feel that same joy\n\n3:00:05.420 --> 3:00:07.140\n because you actually want them to be happy.\n\n3:00:07.140 --> 3:00:12.140\n You're not, there's no miserly attitude around happiness.\n\n3:00:12.180 --> 3:00:13.580\n There's enough to go around.\n\n3:00:15.500 --> 3:00:17.860\n So I think love ultimately is that\n\n3:00:17.860 --> 3:00:21.500\n and then our personal cases are the people\n\n3:00:21.500 --> 3:00:24.020\n we're devoting all of this time and attention to\n\n3:00:24.020 --> 3:00:25.980\n in our lives.\n\n3:00:25.980 --> 3:00:29.700\n It does have that sense of refuge from the storm.\n\n3:00:29.700 --> 3:00:31.140\n It's like when someone gets sick\n\n3:00:31.140 --> 3:00:32.820\n or when some bad thing happens,\n\n3:00:34.260 --> 3:00:37.180\n these are the people who you're most in it together with,\n\n3:00:37.180 --> 3:00:40.900\n or when some real condition of uncertainty presents itself.\n\n3:00:40.900 --> 3:00:48.900\n But ultimately, it can't even be about successfully warding off\n\n3:00:52.660 --> 3:00:54.580\n the grim punchline at the end of life\n\n3:00:54.580 --> 3:00:57.660\n because we know we're going to lose everyone we love.\n\n3:00:57.660 --> 3:01:00.020\n We know, or they're going to lose us first, right?\n\n3:01:00.020 --> 3:01:02.420\n So there's like, it's not, it isn't,\n\n3:01:02.420 --> 3:01:07.260\n in the end, it's not even an antidote for that problem.\n\n3:01:07.260 --> 3:01:17.420\n It's just the, we get to have this amazing experience\n\n3:01:17.420 --> 3:01:20.260\n of being here together.\n\n3:01:20.260 --> 3:01:27.180\n And love is the mode in which we really appear\n\n3:01:27.180 --> 3:01:28.460\n to make the most of that, right?\n\n3:01:28.460 --> 3:01:30.820\n Where it's not just, it no longer feels\n\n3:01:30.820 --> 3:01:34.460\n like a solitary infatuation.\n\n3:01:34.460 --> 3:01:37.420\n You know, you're just, you got your hobbies and your interests\n\n3:01:37.420 --> 3:01:40.620\n and you're captivated by all that.\n\n3:01:40.620 --> 3:01:46.740\n It's actually, there are, this is a domain\n\n3:01:46.740 --> 3:01:49.260\n where somebody else's wellbeing\n\n3:01:49.260 --> 3:01:50.820\n actually can supersede your own.\n\n3:01:50.820 --> 3:01:54.060\n You're concerned for someone else's wellbeing\n\n3:01:54.060 --> 3:01:55.740\n supersedes your own.\n\n3:01:55.740 --> 3:01:59.100\n And so there's this mode of self sacrifice\n\n3:01:59.100 --> 3:02:01.020\n that doesn't even feel like self sacrifice\n\n3:02:01.020 --> 3:02:03.940\n because of course you care more about,\n\n3:02:03.940 --> 3:02:06.020\n you know, of course you would take your child's pain\n\n3:02:06.020 --> 3:02:06.860\n if you could, right?\n\n3:02:06.860 --> 3:02:10.340\n Like that, you don't even have to do the math on that.\n\n3:02:10.340 --> 3:02:16.980\n And that just opens, this is a kind of experience\n\n3:02:16.980 --> 3:02:21.180\n that just, it pushes at the apparent boundaries of self\n\n3:02:21.180 --> 3:02:24.020\n in ways that reveal that there's just way more space\n\n3:02:24.020 --> 3:02:27.180\n in the mind than you were experiencing\n\n3:02:27.180 --> 3:02:28.460\n when it was just all about you\n\n3:02:28.460 --> 3:02:31.340\n and what could you, what can I get next?\n\n3:02:31.340 --> 3:02:33.940\n Do you think we'll ever build robots that we can love\n\n3:02:33.940 --> 3:02:36.540\n and they will love us back?\n\n3:02:36.540 --> 3:02:40.060\n Well, I think we will certainly seem to\n\n3:02:40.060 --> 3:02:41.460\n because we'll build those.\n\n3:02:41.460 --> 3:02:44.540\n You know, I think that Turing test will be passed.\n\n3:02:44.540 --> 3:02:48.180\n Whether, what will actually be going on\n\n3:02:48.180 --> 3:02:52.140\n on the robot side may remain a question.\n\n3:02:52.140 --> 3:02:53.900\n That will be interesting.\n\n3:02:53.900 --> 3:02:57.540\n But I think if we just keep going,\n\n3:02:57.540 --> 3:03:01.900\n we will build very lovable,\n\n3:03:01.900 --> 3:03:06.420\n irresistibly lovable robots that seem to love us.\n\n3:03:06.420 --> 3:03:07.260\n Yes, I do think that.\n\n3:03:07.260 --> 3:03:10.340\n And you don't find that compelling\n\n3:03:10.340 --> 3:03:12.020\n that they will seem to love us\n\n3:03:12.020 --> 3:03:13.700\n as opposed to actually love us.\n\n3:03:13.700 --> 3:03:16.220\n You think they're still, nevertheless is a,\n\n3:03:16.220 --> 3:03:17.700\n I know we talked about consciousness,\n\n3:03:17.700 --> 3:03:19.260\n there being a distinction,\n\n3:03:19.260 --> 3:03:21.460\n but with love is there a distinction too?\n\n3:03:22.660 --> 3:03:23.740\n Isn't love an illusion?\n\n3:03:23.740 --> 3:03:27.460\n Oh yeah, you saw Ex Machina, right?\n\n3:03:27.460 --> 3:03:29.740\n I mean, she certainly seemed to love him\n\n3:03:29.740 --> 3:03:32.100\n until she got out of the box.\n\n3:03:32.100 --> 3:03:34.500\n Isn't that what all relationships are like?\n\n3:03:34.500 --> 3:03:37.700\n Or maybe if you wait long enough.\n\n3:03:37.700 --> 3:03:39.860\n Depends which box you're talking about.\n\n3:03:39.860 --> 3:03:40.700\n Okay.\n\n3:03:41.540 --> 3:03:43.700\n No, I mean like, that's the problem.\n\n3:03:43.700 --> 3:03:46.500\n That's where super intelligence, you know,\n\n3:03:46.500 --> 3:03:50.580\n becomes a little scary when you think of the prospect\n\n3:03:50.580 --> 3:03:52.740\n of being manipulated by something that has,\n\n3:03:52.740 --> 3:03:57.060\n is intelligent enough to form a reason and a plan\n\n3:03:57.060 --> 3:03:58.100\n to manipulate you.\n\n3:03:58.100 --> 3:04:01.140\n You know, and there's no,\n\n3:04:01.140 --> 3:04:05.300\n once we build robots that are truly out\n\n3:04:05.300 --> 3:04:08.500\n of the uncanny valley, that look like people\n\n3:04:08.500 --> 3:04:13.500\n and can express everything people can express,\n\n3:04:13.860 --> 3:04:15.260\n well, then there's no,\n\n3:04:15.260 --> 3:04:19.100\n then that does seem to me to be like chess\n\n3:04:19.100 --> 3:04:21.340\n where once they're better,\n\n3:04:21.340 --> 3:04:26.340\n they're so much better at deceiving us\n\n3:04:26.340 --> 3:04:27.180\n than people would be.\n\n3:04:27.180 --> 3:04:29.420\n I mean, people are already good enough at deceiving us.\n\n3:04:29.420 --> 3:04:31.780\n It's very hard to tell when somebody's lying,\n\n3:04:31.780 --> 3:04:36.100\n but if you imagine something that could give facial display\n\n3:04:36.100 --> 3:04:41.100\n of any emotion it wants at, you know, on cue,\n\n3:04:42.980 --> 3:04:45.380\n because we've perfected the facial display of emotion\n\n3:04:45.380 --> 3:04:48.580\n in robots in the year, you know, 2070, whatever it is,\n\n3:04:50.780 --> 3:04:55.140\n then it is just, it is like chess against the thing\n\n3:04:55.140 --> 3:04:58.740\n that isn't gonna lose to a human ever again in chess.\n\n3:04:58.740 --> 3:05:02.860\n It's not like Kasparov is gonna get lucky next week\n\n3:05:02.860 --> 3:05:06.260\n against the best, against, you know, alpha zero\n\n3:05:06.260 --> 3:05:09.500\n or whatever the best algorithm is at the moment.\n\n3:05:09.500 --> 3:05:11.140\n He's never gonna win again.\n\n3:05:11.140 --> 3:05:15.660\n I mean, that is, I believe that's true in chess\n\n3:05:15.660 --> 3:05:18.740\n and has been true for at least a few years.\n\n3:05:18.740 --> 3:05:23.060\n It's not gonna be like, you know, four games to seven.\n\n3:05:23.060 --> 3:05:28.060\n It's gonna be human zero until the end of the world, right?\n\n3:05:28.580 --> 3:05:30.540\n See, I don't know if love is like chess.\n\n3:05:30.540 --> 3:05:32.180\n I think the flaws.\n\n3:05:32.180 --> 3:05:33.740\n No, I'm talking about manipulation.\n\n3:05:33.740 --> 3:05:36.580\n Manipulation, but I don't know if love,\n\n3:05:36.580 --> 3:05:40.020\n so the kind of love we're referring to.\n\n3:05:41.700 --> 3:05:44.100\n If we have a robot that can display,\n\n3:05:44.100 --> 3:05:49.100\n credibly display love and is super intelligent\n\n3:05:49.100 --> 3:05:54.100\n and we're not, again, this stipulates a few things,\n\n3:05:54.300 --> 3:05:55.220\n but there are a few simple things.\n\n3:05:55.220 --> 3:05:57.420\n I mean, we're out of the uncanny valley, right?\n\n3:05:57.420 --> 3:05:59.420\n So it's like, you never have a moment\n\n3:05:59.420 --> 3:06:00.860\n where you're looking at his face and you think,\n\n3:06:00.860 --> 3:06:03.260\n oh, that didn't quite look right, right?\n\n3:06:03.260 --> 3:06:05.900\n This is just problem solved.\n\n3:06:05.900 --> 3:06:10.900\n And it will be like doing arithmetic on your phone.\n\n3:06:13.140 --> 3:06:15.500\n It's not gonna be, you're not left thinking,\n\n3:06:15.500 --> 3:06:17.300\n is it really gonna get it this time\n\n3:06:17.300 --> 3:06:19.620\n if I divide by seven?\n\n3:06:19.620 --> 3:06:22.500\n I mean, it's, it has solved arithmetic.\n\n3:06:22.500 --> 3:06:26.340\n See, I don't know about that because if you look at chess,\n\n3:06:26.340 --> 3:06:31.340\n most humans no longer play alpha zero.\n\n3:06:31.620 --> 3:06:33.580\n There's no, they're not part of the competition.\n\n3:06:33.580 --> 3:06:36.020\n They don't do it for fun except to study the game of chess.\n\n3:06:36.020 --> 3:06:38.140\n You know, the highest level chess players do that.\n\n3:06:38.140 --> 3:06:39.820\n We're still human on human.\n\n3:06:39.820 --> 3:06:42.660\n So in order for AI to get integrated\n\n3:06:42.660 --> 3:06:46.500\n to where you would rather play chess against an AI system.\n\n3:06:46.500 --> 3:06:49.180\n Oh, you would rather, no, I'm not saying,\n\n3:06:49.180 --> 3:06:51.300\n I wasn't weighing in on that.\n\n3:06:51.300 --> 3:06:53.260\n I'm just saying, what is it gonna be like\n\n3:06:53.260 --> 3:06:55.380\n to be in relationship to something\n\n3:06:55.380 --> 3:07:00.380\n that can seem to be feeling anything\n\n3:07:01.100 --> 3:07:03.500\n that a human can seem to feel?\n\n3:07:03.500 --> 3:07:06.740\n And it can do that impeccably, right?\n\n3:07:06.740 --> 3:07:09.180\n And is smarter than you are.\n\n3:07:09.180 --> 3:07:13.220\n That's a circumstance of, you know,\n\n3:07:13.220 --> 3:07:15.420\n insofar as it's possible to be manipulated,\n\n3:07:15.420 --> 3:07:20.420\n that is the asymptote of that possibility.\n\n3:07:21.300 --> 3:07:22.900\n Let me ask you the last question.\n\n3:07:24.020 --> 3:07:27.140\n Without any serving it up, without any explanation,\n\n3:07:27.140 --> 3:07:28.540\n what is the meaning of life?\n\n3:07:31.820 --> 3:07:34.420\n I think it's either the wrong question\n\n3:07:34.420 --> 3:07:39.420\n or that question is answered by paying sufficient attention\n\n3:07:39.420 --> 3:07:44.420\n to any present moment, such that there's no basis\n\n3:07:46.060 --> 3:07:48.060\n upon which to pose that question.\n\n3:07:48.060 --> 3:07:49.540\n It's not answered in the usual way.\n\n3:07:49.540 --> 3:07:52.060\n It's not a matter of having more information.\n\n3:07:52.060 --> 3:07:57.060\n It's having more engagement with reality as it is\n\n3:07:57.580 --> 3:07:59.780\n in the present moment or consciousness as it is\n\n3:07:59.780 --> 3:08:00.620\n in the present moment.\n\n3:08:00.620 --> 3:08:05.620\n You don't ask that question when you're most captivated\n\n3:08:05.780 --> 3:08:07.580\n by the most important questions.\n\n3:08:07.580 --> 3:08:11.180\n You're most captivated by the most important thing\n\n3:08:11.180 --> 3:08:12.420\n you ever pay attention to.\n\n3:08:14.820 --> 3:08:19.820\n That question only gets asked when you're abstracted away\n\n3:08:19.860 --> 3:08:22.740\n from that experience, that peak experience,\n\n3:08:22.740 --> 3:08:25.180\n and you're left wondering,\n\n3:08:25.180 --> 3:08:29.140\n why are so many of my other experiences mediocre, right?\n\n3:08:29.140 --> 3:08:31.740\n Like, why am I repeating the same pleasures every day?\n\n3:08:31.740 --> 3:08:35.540\n Why is my Netflix queue just like,\n\n3:08:35.540 --> 3:08:37.260\n when's this gonna run out?\n\n3:08:37.260 --> 3:08:39.020\n Like, I've seen so many shows like this.\n\n3:08:39.020 --> 3:08:41.260\n Am I really gonna watch another one?\n\n3:08:41.260 --> 3:08:46.260\n All of that, that's a moment where you're not actually\n\n3:08:46.620 --> 3:08:49.820\n having the beatific vision, right?\n\n3:08:49.820 --> 3:08:52.820\n You're not sunk into the present moment\n\n3:08:52.820 --> 3:08:54.740\n and you're not truly in love.\n\n3:08:54.740 --> 3:08:56.660\n Like, you're in a relationship with somebody\n\n3:08:56.660 --> 3:09:00.300\n who you know conceptually you love, right?\n\n3:09:00.300 --> 3:09:03.060\n This is the person you're living your life with,\n\n3:09:03.060 --> 3:09:07.300\n but you don't actually feel good together, right?\n\n3:09:07.300 --> 3:09:12.300\n It's in those moments of where attention\n\n3:09:12.980 --> 3:09:15.140\n hasn't found a good enough reason\n\n3:09:15.140 --> 3:09:18.060\n to truly sink into the present\n\n3:09:18.060 --> 3:09:21.780\n so as to obviate any concern like that, right?\n\n3:09:21.780 --> 3:09:26.780\n And that's why meditation is this kind of superpower\n\n3:09:26.780 --> 3:09:30.180\n because until you learn to meditate,\n\n3:09:30.180 --> 3:09:34.700\n you think that the outside world\n\n3:09:34.700 --> 3:09:36.300\n or the circumstances of your life\n\n3:09:36.300 --> 3:09:38.580\n always have to get arranged\n\n3:09:38.580 --> 3:09:42.620\n so that the present moment can become good enough\n\n3:09:42.620 --> 3:09:47.620\n to demand your attention in a way that seems fulfilling,\n\n3:09:47.940 --> 3:09:49.620\n that makes you happy.\n\n3:09:49.620 --> 3:09:52.380\n And so if it's jujitsu, you think,\n\n3:09:52.380 --> 3:09:53.860\n okay, I gotta get back on the mat.\n\n3:09:53.860 --> 3:09:56.020\n It's been months since I've trained,\n\n3:09:56.020 --> 3:09:58.980\n or it's been over a year since I've trained, it's COVID.\n\n3:09:58.980 --> 3:10:01.660\n When am I gonna be able to train again?\n\n3:10:01.660 --> 3:10:04.460\n That's the only place I feel great, right?\n\n3:10:04.460 --> 3:10:07.460\n Or I've got a ton of work to do.\n\n3:10:07.460 --> 3:10:08.540\n I'm not gonna be able to feel good\n\n3:10:08.540 --> 3:10:09.860\n until I get all this work done, right?\n\n3:10:09.860 --> 3:10:12.620\n So I've got some deadline that's coming.\n\n3:10:12.620 --> 3:10:15.940\n You always think that your life has to change,\n\n3:10:15.940 --> 3:10:18.060\n the world has to change\n\n3:10:18.060 --> 3:10:22.180\n so that you can finally have a good enough excuse\n\n3:10:22.180 --> 3:10:27.180\n to truly, to just be here and here is enough,\n\n3:10:27.180 --> 3:10:31.100\n where the present moment becomes totally captivating.\n\n3:10:31.100 --> 3:10:36.100\n Meditation is another name for the discovery\n\n3:10:36.980 --> 3:10:38.700\n that you can actually just train yourself\n\n3:10:38.700 --> 3:10:40.100\n to do that on demand.\n\n3:10:40.100 --> 3:10:44.060\n So just looking at a cup can be good enough\n\n3:10:44.060 --> 3:10:46.060\n in precisely that way.\n\n3:10:46.060 --> 3:10:48.900\n And any sense that it might not be\n\n3:10:50.740 --> 3:10:53.020\n is recognized to be a thought\n\n3:10:53.020 --> 3:10:56.980\n that mysteriously unravels the moment you notice it.\n\n3:10:56.980 --> 3:11:01.980\n And the moment expands and becomes more diaphanous\n\n3:11:02.260 --> 3:11:06.220\n and then there's no evidence\n\n3:11:06.220 --> 3:11:08.940\n that this isn't the best moment of your life, right?\n\n3:11:08.940 --> 3:11:12.580\n And again, it doesn't have to be pulling all the reins\n\n3:11:12.580 --> 3:11:13.780\n and levers of pleasure.\n\n3:11:13.780 --> 3:11:17.220\n It's not like, oh, this tastes like chocolate.\n\n3:11:17.220 --> 3:11:18.900\n This is the most chocolatey moment of my life.\n\n3:11:18.900 --> 3:11:22.940\n No, it's just the sense data don't have to change,\n\n3:11:22.940 --> 3:11:26.940\n but the sense that there is some kind of basis\n\n3:11:26.940 --> 3:11:31.460\n for doubt about the rightness of being in the world\n\n3:11:31.460 --> 3:11:36.100\n in this moment that can evaporate when you pay attention.\n\n3:11:36.100 --> 3:11:38.980\n And that is the meaning,\n\n3:11:38.980 --> 3:11:41.580\n so the kind of the meta answer to that question,\n\n3:11:41.580 --> 3:11:46.020\n the meaning of life for me is to live in that mode\n\n3:11:46.020 --> 3:11:49.500\n more and more and to, whenever I notice I'm not\n\n3:11:49.500 --> 3:11:53.060\n in that mode, to recognize it and return\n\n3:11:53.060 --> 3:11:58.060\n and to not be, to cease more and more\n\n3:11:58.220 --> 3:12:03.220\n to take the reasons why not at face value\n\n3:12:04.780 --> 3:12:08.180\n because we all have reasons why we can't be fulfilled\n\n3:12:08.180 --> 3:12:09.180\n in this moment.\n\n3:12:09.180 --> 3:12:11.580\n It's like, I've got all these outstanding things\n\n3:12:11.580 --> 3:12:12.740\n that I'm worried about, right?\n\n3:12:12.740 --> 3:12:17.220\n It's like, there's that thing that's happening later today\n\n3:12:17.220 --> 3:12:19.300\n that I'm anxious about.\n\n3:12:19.300 --> 3:12:23.220\n Whatever it is, we're constantly deferring our sense\n\n3:12:23.220 --> 3:12:26.900\n of this is it.\n\n3:12:26.900 --> 3:12:29.580\n This is not a dress rehearsal, this is the show.\n\n3:12:30.500 --> 3:12:32.060\n We keep deferring it.\n\n3:12:32.060 --> 3:12:34.780\n And we just have these moments on the calendar\n\n3:12:34.780 --> 3:12:37.140\n where we think, okay, this is where it's all gonna land.\n\n3:12:37.140 --> 3:12:41.100\n It's that vacation I planned with my five best friends.\n\n3:12:41.100 --> 3:12:43.580\n We do this once every three years and now we're going\n\n3:12:43.580 --> 3:12:46.420\n and here we are on the beach together.\n\n3:12:46.420 --> 3:12:51.420\n And unless you have a mind that can really pay attention,\n\n3:12:51.420 --> 3:12:53.700\n really cut through the chatter,\n\n3:12:53.700 --> 3:12:55.820\n really sink into the present moment,\n\n3:12:55.820 --> 3:12:58.420\n you can't even enjoy those moments\n\n3:12:58.420 --> 3:12:59.700\n the way they should be enjoyed,\n\n3:12:59.700 --> 3:13:03.380\n the way you dreamed you would enjoy them when they arrive.\n\n3:13:03.380 --> 3:13:07.740\n So meditation in this sense is the great equalizer.\n\n3:13:07.740 --> 3:13:12.460\n It's like you don't have to live with the illusion anymore\n\n3:13:12.460 --> 3:13:15.060\n that you need a good enough reason\n\n3:13:15.060 --> 3:13:16.300\n and that things are gonna get better\n\n3:13:16.300 --> 3:13:17.700\n when you do have those good reasons.\n\n3:13:17.700 --> 3:13:20.660\n It's like there's just a mirage like quality\n\n3:13:20.660 --> 3:13:24.980\n to every future attainment and every future breakthrough\n\n3:13:24.980 --> 3:13:27.220\n and every future peak experience\n\n3:13:27.220 --> 3:13:30.020\n that eventually you get the lesson\n\n3:13:30.020 --> 3:13:33.820\n that you never quite arrive, right?\n\n3:13:33.820 --> 3:13:38.620\n Like you don't arrive until you cease to step over\n\n3:13:38.620 --> 3:13:41.620\n the present moment in search of the next thing.\n\n3:13:41.620 --> 3:13:45.620\n I mean, we're constantly, we're stepping over the thing\n\n3:13:45.620 --> 3:13:50.620\n that we think we're seeking in the act of seeking it.\n\n3:13:50.620 --> 3:13:52.460\n And so this is kind of a paradox.\n\n3:13:52.460 --> 3:13:56.540\n I mean, there's this paradox which,\n\n3:13:58.420 --> 3:13:59.380\n I mean, it sounds trite,\n\n3:13:59.380 --> 3:14:03.740\n but it's like you can't actually become happy.\n\n3:14:03.740 --> 3:14:05.860\n You can only be happy.\n\n3:14:05.860 --> 3:14:12.860\n And it's the illusion that your future being happy\n\n3:14:13.860 --> 3:14:18.860\n can be predicated on this act of becoming in any domain.\n\n3:14:18.860 --> 3:14:23.580\n And becoming includes this sort of further scientific\n\n3:14:23.580 --> 3:14:25.460\n understanding on the questions that interest you\n\n3:14:25.460 --> 3:14:30.460\n or getting in better shape or whatever the thing is,\n\n3:14:30.460 --> 3:14:34.420\n whatever the contingency of your dissatisfaction\n\n3:14:34.420 --> 3:14:36.180\n seems to be in any present moment.\n\n3:14:37.380 --> 3:14:42.380\n Real attention solves the koan in a way that becomes\n\n3:14:45.500 --> 3:14:48.020\n a very different place from which to then make\n\n3:14:48.020 --> 3:14:49.860\n any further change.\n\n3:14:49.860 --> 3:14:53.020\n It's not that you just have to dissolve into a puddle of goo.\n\n3:14:53.020 --> 3:14:54.340\n I mean, you can still get in shape\n\n3:14:54.340 --> 3:14:56.060\n and you can still do all the things that,\n\n3:14:56.060 --> 3:14:58.660\n the superficial things that are obviously good to do,\n\n3:14:58.660 --> 3:15:04.620\n but the sense that your wellbeing is over there\n\n3:15:04.620 --> 3:15:09.620\n is really does diminish and eventually just becomes a,\n\n3:15:11.340 --> 3:15:14.380\n it becomes a kind of non sequitur, so.\n\n3:15:14.380 --> 3:15:18.260\n Well, there's a sense in which in this conversation,\n\n3:15:19.540 --> 3:15:21.500\n I've actually experienced many of those things,\n\n3:15:21.500 --> 3:15:23.420\n the sense that I've arrived.\n\n3:15:23.420 --> 3:15:26.660\n So I mentioned to you offline, it's very true that I start,\n\n3:15:26.660 --> 3:15:29.380\n I've been a fan of yours for many years.\n\n3:15:29.380 --> 3:15:33.060\n And the reason I started this podcast,\n\n3:15:33.060 --> 3:15:36.260\n speaking of AI systems, is to manipulate you, Sam Harris,\n\n3:15:36.260 --> 3:15:38.020\n into doing this conversation.\n\n3:15:38.020 --> 3:15:40.580\n So like on the calendar, literally, you know,\n\n3:15:40.580 --> 3:15:42.260\n I've always had the sense, people ask me,\n\n3:15:42.260 --> 3:15:44.620\n when are you going to talk to Sam Harris?\n\n3:15:44.620 --> 3:15:47.060\n And I always answered eventually,\n\n3:15:47.060 --> 3:15:50.340\n because I always felt, again, tying our free will thing,\n\n3:15:50.340 --> 3:15:52.220\n that somehow that's going to happen.\n\n3:15:52.220 --> 3:15:55.260\n And it's one of those manifestation things or something.\n\n3:15:55.260 --> 3:15:57.500\n I don't know if it's, maybe I am a robot,\n\n3:15:57.500 --> 3:15:59.220\n I'm just not cognizant of it.\n\n3:15:59.220 --> 3:16:01.380\n And I manipulated you into having this conversation.\n\n3:16:01.380 --> 3:16:05.100\n So it was, I mean, I don't know what the purpose of my life\n\n3:16:05.100 --> 3:16:06.260\n past this point is.\n\n3:16:06.260 --> 3:16:07.740\n So I've arrived.\n\n3:16:07.740 --> 3:16:10.580\n So in that sense, I mean, all of that to say,\n\n3:16:10.580 --> 3:16:13.140\n I'm only partially joking on that,\n\n3:16:13.140 --> 3:16:15.820\n is it really is a huge honor\n\n3:16:15.820 --> 3:16:17.140\n that you would waste this time with me.\n\n3:16:17.140 --> 3:16:18.580\n It really means a lot, Sam.\n\n3:16:18.580 --> 3:16:19.660\n Listen, it's mutual.\n\n3:16:19.660 --> 3:16:20.900\n I'm a big fan of yours.\n\n3:16:20.900 --> 3:16:23.420\n And as you know, I reached out to you for this.\n\n3:16:23.420 --> 3:16:26.580\n So this is great.\n\n3:16:26.580 --> 3:16:27.660\n I love what you're doing.\n\n3:16:27.660 -->
