Bush administration\n\n00:45.320 --> 00:47.000\n acted in a state of panic.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:49.080\n And I think they wanted to show a kind of toughness.\n\n00:49.080 --> 00:51.880\n They wanted to show some kind of resolve.\n\n00:51.880 --> 00:55.120\n This was a horrific act that played out\n\n00:55.120 --> 00:57.280\n on everyone's television screens.\n\n00:57.280 --> 00:59.600\n And I think it was really fundamentally\n\n00:59.600 --> 01:01.600\n a crisis of legitimacy within the White House,\n\n01:01.600 --> 01:02.440\n within the Oval Office.\n\n01:02.440 --> 01:05.200\n And I think they felt like they had to do something\n\n01:05.200 --> 01:06.640\n and something dramatic.\n\n01:06.640 --> 01:08.880\n I think they didn't really think through\n\n01:08.880 --> 01:11.880\n who they were fighting, who the enemy was,\n\n01:11.880 --> 01:14.680\n what this geography had to do with 9 11.\n\n01:14.680 --> 01:17.160\n I think looking back at it, I mean, some of us,\n\n01:17.160 --> 01:19.800\n not to say I was clairvoyant or could see into the future,\n\n01:19.800 --> 01:22.360\n but I think many of us were, from that morning,\n\n01:22.360 --> 01:24.240\n skeptical about the connections that people were drawing\n\n01:24.240 --> 01:27.560\n between Afghanistan as a state, as a place,\n\n01:27.560 --> 01:30.160\n and the actions of Al Qaeda in Washington\n\n01:30.160 --> 01:32.960\n and New York and Pennsylvania.\n\n01:32.960 --> 01:35.880\n So as you watch the events of 9 11,\n\n01:35.880 --> 01:40.240\n the things that our leaders were saying\n\n01:40.240 --> 01:44.720\n in the minutes, hours, days, weeks that followed,\n\n01:44.720 --> 01:47.720\n maybe you can give a little bit of a timeline\n\n01:47.720 --> 01:49.680\n of what was being said.\n\n01:49.680 --> 01:52.240\n One was the actual invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n01:52.240 --> 01:55.320\n And also, what were your feelings\n\n01:55.320 --> 01:59.400\n in the minutes, weeks after 9 11?\n\n01:59.400 --> 02:00.360\n I was in DC.\n\n02:00.360 --> 02:04.120\n I was on the way to American University\n\n02:04.120 --> 02:07.200\n hearing on NPR what had happened.\n\n02:07.200 --> 02:10.520\n And I thought of the American University logo,\n\n02:10.520 --> 02:11.720\n which is red, white, and blue.\n\n02:11.720 --> 02:12.960\n It's an eagle.\n\n02:12.960 --> 02:15.360\n And I thought Washington is under attack\n\n02:15.360 --> 02:18.600\n and symbols of American power are under attack.\n\n02:18.600 --> 02:22.200\n And so I was quite concerned and at the time lived\n\n02:22.200 --> 02:24.760\n just a few miles from the capital.\n\n02:24.760 --> 02:28.360\n And so I felt that it was real.\n\n02:28.360 --> 02:32.240\n So I appreciate the sense of anxiety and fear and panic.\n\n02:32.240 --> 02:35.320\n And four, two, three years later in DC,\n\n02:35.320 --> 02:37.680\n we were constantly getting reports,\n\n02:37.680 --> 02:40.800\n mostly rumors and unconfirmed about all kinds of attacks\n\n02:40.800 --> 02:41.640\n that befall the city.\n\n02:41.640 --> 02:46.200\n So I definitely appreciate the sense of being under assault.\n\n02:46.200 --> 02:47.240\n But in watching television,\n\n02:47.240 --> 02:48.680\n including Russian television that day,\n\n02:48.680 --> 02:51.200\n because I just installed a satellite thing.\n\n02:51.200 --> 02:52.400\n So I was trying to watch world news\n\n02:52.400 --> 02:53.240\n and get different points of view.\n\n02:53.240 --> 02:54.920\n And that was quite useful\n\n02:54.920 --> 02:57.320\n to have an alternative set of eyes.\n\n02:57.320 --> 02:58.160\n In Russian?\n\n02:58.160 --> 02:59.360\n Yeah, in Russian, yeah.\n\n02:59.360 --> 03:01.440\n Okay, so your Russians is good enough\n\n03:01.440 --> 03:03.120\n to understand Russian television.\n\n03:03.120 --> 03:05.520\n The news, yeah, the news and the visuals that were coming\n\n03:05.520 --> 03:07.920\n that were not shown on American television.\n\n03:07.920 --> 03:09.280\n I don't know how they had it, but they had,\n\n03:09.280 --> 03:11.320\n they were not filtering anything\n\n03:11.320 --> 03:13.080\n in the way that the major networks\n\n03:13.080 --> 03:14.520\n and cable televisions were doing here.\n\n03:14.520 --> 03:17.720\n So it was a very unvarnished view of the violence\n\n03:17.720 --> 03:19.400\n of the moment in New York City\n\n03:19.400 --> 03:22.320\n of people diving from the towers or being,\n\n03:22.320 --> 03:24.440\n and it was really, they didn't hold back on that,\n\n03:24.440 --> 03:26.280\n which was quite fascinating.\n\n03:26.280 --> 03:27.560\n I think much of the world saw much more\n\n03:27.560 --> 03:29.880\n than actually the American public saw.\n\n03:29.880 --> 03:33.760\n But to your question, amid that feeling of imminent doom,\n\n03:33.760 --> 03:36.840\n I watched commentators start to talk about Al Qaeda\n\n03:36.840 --> 03:39.080\n and then talk about Afghanistan.\n\n03:39.080 --> 03:42.880\n And one of the experts was Barnett Rubin,\n\n03:42.880 --> 03:45.760\n who's at NYU, who's a kind of long,\n\n03:45.760 --> 03:48.560\n very learned Afghanistan hand.\n\n03:48.560 --> 03:50.480\n And he's brought on Peter Jennings on ABC News\n\n03:50.480 --> 03:52.800\n to kind of lay this out for everyone.\n\n03:54.080 --> 03:55.320\n And I thought, you know, he did a fine job,\n\n03:55.320 --> 03:57.920\n but I think it was formative in submitting the view\n\n03:57.920 --> 04:00.160\n that somehow Al Qaeda was synonymous\n\n04:00.160 --> 04:02.040\n with this space, Afghanistan.\n\n04:02.040 --> 04:06.240\n And I think, again, I was no Al Qaeda expert then,\n\n04:06.240 --> 04:09.160\n and I'm not now, but I think my immediate thought\n\n04:09.160 --> 04:13.720\n went to war and because my background had been with,\n\n04:13.720 --> 04:15.840\n at that point, mostly Afghans who had been displaced\n\n04:15.840 --> 04:17.720\n from decades of war,\n\n04:17.720 --> 04:19.080\n whom I encountered in Uzbekistan,\n\n04:19.080 --> 04:20.920\n who were refugees and so on.\n\n04:20.920 --> 04:24.080\n I thought immediately, my mind went to the suffering\n\n04:24.080 --> 04:28.240\n of Afghan people, that this war was going to sweep up,\n\n04:28.240 --> 04:30.000\n of course, the defenseless people\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:31.400\n who have nothing to do with these politics.\n\n04:31.400 --> 04:33.280\n So we should give maybe a little bit of context\n\n04:33.280 --> 04:35.200\n that you could speak to.\n\n04:35.200 --> 04:38.240\n So assume nobody's an expert at anything.\n\n04:38.240 --> 04:43.240\n So let's just say you and I are not experts at anything.\n\n04:43.280 --> 04:46.400\n What, as a historian, were you studying at the time\n\n04:46.400 --> 04:51.400\n and thinking about, is it the full global history\n\n04:52.200 --> 04:53.680\n of Afghanistan?\n\n04:53.680 --> 04:55.400\n Is it the region?\n\n04:55.400 --> 04:58.880\n Were you thinking about the Mujahideen\n\n04:58.880 --> 05:01.720\n and Al Qaeda and Taliban?\n\n05:01.720 --> 05:04.160\n Were you thinking about the Soviet Union,\n\n05:04.160 --> 05:06.600\n the proxy war through Afghanistan?\n\n05:06.600 --> 05:09.880\n Were you thinking about Iraq and oil?\n\n05:09.880 --> 05:12.760\n What's the full space of things in your heart,\n\n05:12.760 --> 05:14.320\n in your mind at the time?\n\n05:14.320 --> 05:16.440\n I mean, just at the moment, of course, it was just the sense\n\n05:16.440 --> 05:19.480\n of the suffering and the tragedy\n\n05:19.480 --> 05:21.400\n of the moment of the deaths.\n\n05:21.400 --> 05:23.320\n And that was, I think, I was preoccupied\n\n05:23.320 --> 05:25.360\n by the violence of the moment.\n\n05:26.280 --> 05:28.520\n But as the conversation turned to Afghanistan,\n\n05:28.520 --> 05:31.320\n as a kind of theater, to somehow respond to this moment,\n\n05:31.320 --> 05:32.360\n I think immediately what came to mind\n\n05:32.360 --> 05:34.640\n was that little I knew about Al Qaeda at the time\n\n05:34.640 --> 05:38.120\n suggested that the geography was inaccurate,\n\n05:38.120 --> 05:41.320\n that this was a global network, a global threat,\n\n05:41.320 --> 05:45.200\n that this was a movement that went beyond borders.\n\n05:45.200 --> 05:47.200\n And I think that it felt early on\n\n05:47.200 --> 05:50.480\n that Afghanistan was gonna be used as a scapegoat.\n\n05:50.480 --> 05:51.640\n And intellectually at the time,\n\n05:51.640 --> 05:52.960\n I was teaching at American University.\n\n05:52.960 --> 05:56.320\n My courses touched on a range of subjects,\n\n05:56.320 --> 05:58.240\n but I was trying to complete a book\n\n05:58.240 --> 06:01.160\n on Islam and the Russian Empire, actually.\n\n06:01.160 --> 06:04.040\n But in doing that research, which took me across Russia\n\n06:04.040 --> 06:06.520\n and Central Asia, purely by accident,\n\n06:06.520 --> 06:08.520\n I had developed an interest in Afghanistan\n\n06:08.520 --> 06:12.720\n because just, again, a series of coincidences.\n\n06:12.720 --> 06:15.280\n I found myself in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan,\n\n06:15.280 --> 06:17.960\n without housing, through an American friend\n\n06:17.960 --> 06:20.160\n who was like the king of the market in Tashkent.\n\n06:20.160 --> 06:21.400\n He knew everyone.\n\n06:21.400 --> 06:24.400\n He ran into some Afghan merchants there.\n\n06:24.400 --> 06:26.760\n They found out I didn't have a place to live.\n\n06:26.760 --> 06:28.240\n I didn't know where Afghanistan was, honestly.\n\n06:28.240 --> 06:29.320\n This was 1997.\n\n06:29.320 --> 06:30.560\n I had a vague idea it was next door.\n\n06:30.560 --> 06:32.160\n Well, you lived in Uzbekistan?\n\n06:32.160 --> 06:35.000\n Yeah, in Tashkent, doing dissertation research, yeah.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.880\n Because it was hub of the Russian Empire in Central Asia.\n\n06:37.880 --> 06:40.240\n So just by accident, I met with these young Afghans\n\n06:40.240 --> 06:42.720\n who took me in as roommates.\n\n06:42.720 --> 06:46.240\n And that, I think, the sense of that community\n\n06:46.240 --> 06:48.480\n shaped my idea of what Afghanistan is.\n\n06:48.480 --> 06:51.160\n It was my first exposure to them.\n\n06:51.160 --> 06:53.480\n They were part of a trading diaspora.\n\n06:53.480 --> 06:57.440\n They had brought matches from Riga, Latvia.\n\n06:57.440 --> 06:59.960\n They had somehow brought flour\n\n06:59.960 --> 07:02.800\n and some agricultural products from Egypt.\n\n07:02.800 --> 07:06.480\n And they were sitting in closed containers in Tashkent\n\n07:06.480 --> 07:10.120\n waiting for the Uzbekistan state to permit them to trade.\n\n07:10.120 --> 07:11.880\n So these guys are mostly hanging out during the day.\n\n07:11.880 --> 07:12.800\n They'll get dressed up.\n\n07:12.800 --> 07:15.160\n They put on suits and ties like you're wearing.\n\n07:15.160 --> 07:16.480\n They'd polish their shoes.\n\n07:16.480 --> 07:21.480\n And they would sit around offices, drink tea, pistachios.\n\n07:21.800 --> 07:23.240\n Then they'd feast at lunch.\n\n07:23.240 --> 07:25.120\n And then at night, we would go out.\n\n07:25.120 --> 07:26.800\n So part of my research,\n\n07:26.800 --> 07:28.160\n because I also had a bottleneck in my research,\n\n07:28.160 --> 07:31.880\n I was going to the state archives in Tashkent.\n\n07:31.880 --> 07:34.160\n And because of the state of Uzbekistan,\n\n07:34.160 --> 07:36.560\n that was a very kind of suspicious thing to do.\n\n07:36.560 --> 07:38.200\n So it took a while to get in.\n\n07:38.200 --> 07:41.600\n So I had downtime in Tashkent, just like these guys.\n\n07:41.600 --> 07:42.800\n So I got to know them pretty well.\n\n07:42.800 --> 07:45.880\n And it was really just an accidental kind of thing,\n\n07:45.880 --> 07:47.600\n but grew quite close to them.\n\n07:47.600 --> 07:49.400\n And I developed an appreciation of,\n\n07:50.520 --> 07:53.280\n which now I think, again, thinking of the seeds of all this,\n\n07:53.280 --> 07:55.800\n these people had already lived,\n\n07:55.800 --> 07:57.240\n young guys in their 20s,\n\n07:57.240 --> 07:59.840\n they'd already lived in six or seven countries.\n\n07:59.840 --> 08:02.040\n They all spoke half a dozen languages.\n\n08:02.040 --> 08:05.080\n One of my best friends there had been a kickboxer\n\n08:06.080 --> 08:08.240\n and break dancer, trained in Tehran.\n\n08:08.240 --> 08:11.240\n His father was a theater person in Afghanistan.\n\n08:11.240 --> 08:14.480\n He told stories of escaping death in Afghanistan\n\n08:14.480 --> 08:16.960\n during the civil war, going to Uzbekistan,\n\n08:16.960 --> 08:18.640\n escaping death there.\n\n08:18.640 --> 08:21.200\n And these were very real stories.\n\n08:21.200 --> 08:23.920\n Can you also just briefly mention,\n\n08:23.920 --> 08:25.880\n geographically speaking,\n\n08:25.880 --> 08:29.840\n Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, you mentioned Iran.\n\n08:29.840 --> 08:32.680\n Who are the neighbors of all of this?\n\n08:32.680 --> 08:35.200\n What are we supposed to be thinking about for people?\n\n08:35.200 --> 08:38.800\n I was always terrible at geography and spatial information.\n\n08:38.800 --> 08:39.960\n So can you lay it out?\n\n08:39.960 --> 08:40.960\n Yeah, sure, sure.\n\n08:40.960 --> 08:44.280\n So Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan.\n\n08:44.280 --> 08:49.280\n It was a hub of Russian imperial power in the 19th century.\n\n08:49.680 --> 08:52.960\n The Russians take the city from a local kind of Muslim\n\n08:52.960 --> 08:55.360\n dynasty in 1865.\n\n08:55.360 --> 08:59.320\n It becomes the city, the kind of hub of Soviet power\n\n08:59.320 --> 09:01.760\n in Central Asia after 1917.\n\n09:01.760 --> 09:06.760\n It becomes the center of the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan,\n\n09:06.800 --> 09:09.160\n which becomes independent finally in 1991\n\n09:09.160 --> 09:10.720\n when the Soviet Union collapses.\n\n09:10.720 --> 09:14.400\n So these are all like these republics\n\n09:14.400 --> 09:18.400\n are the fingertips of Soviet power in Central Asia.\n\n09:18.400 --> 09:19.320\n That's right.\n\n09:19.320 --> 09:22.360\n And they've been independent since 1991,\n\n09:22.360 --> 09:25.560\n but they have struggled to disentangle themselves\n\n09:25.560 --> 09:28.280\n from Moscow, from one another.\n\n09:28.280 --> 09:31.320\n And now they face very serious pressure from China\n\n09:31.320 --> 09:34.880\n to form a kind of periphery of the great machine\n\n09:34.880 --> 09:37.680\n that is the Chinese economy and its ambitions\n\n09:37.680 --> 09:39.640\n to stretch across Asia.\n\n09:40.840 --> 09:43.640\n For Afghanistan, where my roommates, my friends\n\n09:43.640 --> 09:48.640\n hailed from, Afghanistan had fallen into civil war\n\n09:49.760 --> 09:52.240\n in the late 1970s when leftists tried\n\n09:52.240 --> 09:54.680\n to seize power there in 1978.\n\n09:54.680 --> 09:58.400\n The Soviet Union then extended from Uzbekistan,\n\n09:58.400 --> 10:01.600\n crossing the border with its forces in 1979\n\n10:01.600 --> 10:03.640\n to try to shore up this leftist government\n\n10:03.640 --> 10:06.360\n that had seized power in 1978.\n\n10:06.360 --> 10:09.760\n And so for Central Asians in the wider region,\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.920\n their fate had for some decades been tied to Afghanistan\n\n10:13.920 --> 10:17.400\n in a variety of ways, but it became much more connected\n\n10:17.400 --> 10:21.880\n in the 1980s when the Soviet Red Army occupied Afghanistan\n\n10:21.880 --> 10:23.280\n for 10 years.\n\n10:23.280 --> 10:25.120\n And here, I refer your listeners and viewers\n\n10:25.120 --> 10:28.600\n to Rainbow Three as the guide to.\n\n10:28.600 --> 10:30.080\n The historically accurate guide.\n\n10:30.080 --> 10:32.320\n The historically accurate, the Bible.\n\n10:32.320 --> 10:34.440\n The Bible of Afghan history in Rainbow Three, yeah.\n\n10:34.440 --> 10:39.320\n As a fantastic window onto the American view of the war.\n\n10:39.320 --> 10:41.720\n But for us Afghans, there are people who fought\n\n10:41.720 --> 10:45.640\n against the Soviet army, but of a certain generation,\n\n10:46.560 --> 10:50.840\n the guys I knew, their mission was to survive.\n\n10:50.840 --> 10:54.040\n And so they fled in waves by the millions\n\n10:54.040 --> 10:56.680\n to Pakistan, to Iran.\n\n10:56.680 --> 11:00.520\n Some went north into Soviet Central Asia later in the 1990s.\n\n11:00.520 --> 11:02.200\n And some were displaced across the planet.\n\n11:02.200 --> 11:03.960\n So California, where we're sitting today,\n\n11:03.960 --> 11:07.920\n has a large community that came in the 80s and 90s\n\n11:07.920 --> 11:09.680\n in the East Bay.\n\n11:09.680 --> 11:12.720\n Can I ask a quick question that's a little bit of a tangent?\n\n11:12.720 --> 11:13.920\n Yep.\n\n11:13.920 --> 11:17.720\n What is the correct or the respectful way\n\n11:17.720 --> 11:22.720\n to pronounce Afghanistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iran?\n\n11:25.840 --> 11:28.600\n So as a Russian speaker, Afghanistan.\n\n11:28.600 --> 11:30.040\n Yeah.\n\n11:30.040 --> 11:32.400\n The an versus the an.\n\n11:32.400 --> 11:33.240\n Yeah.\n\n11:33.240 --> 11:34.720\n Is it a different country by country?\n\n11:34.720 --> 11:37.160\n As an English speaker in America,\n\n11:37.160 --> 11:41.360\n is it pretentious and disrespectful to say Afghanistan?\n\n11:41.360 --> 11:44.440\n Or is it the opposite, respectful to say it that way?\n\n11:44.440 --> 11:45.400\n What are your thoughts on this?\n\n11:45.400 --> 11:47.240\n That's a fascinating question.\n\n11:47.240 --> 11:50.160\n I defer to the people from those countries\n\n11:50.160 --> 11:52.600\n to, of course, sort out those politics.\n\n11:52.600 --> 11:55.080\n I think one of the fascinating things about the region\n\n11:55.080 --> 11:57.080\n broadly is that it is a place of so many cultures\n\n11:57.080 --> 12:00.040\n and it's really quite cosmopolitan.\n\n12:00.040 --> 12:02.000\n So I think people are mostly quite forgiving\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.560\n about how you say Afghanistan, Afghanistan.\n\n12:04.560 --> 12:05.840\n It's not like Paris.\n\n12:05.840 --> 12:06.680\n Yeah, right, right.\n\n12:06.680 --> 12:07.880\n The French are not forgiving.\n\n12:07.880 --> 12:08.720\n No, no, no.\n\n12:08.720 --> 12:09.560\n Exactly.\n\n12:09.560 --> 12:10.680\n I think people are very, very forgiving.\n\n12:10.680 --> 12:15.680\n And I think that Iranians are a bit more instructive\n\n12:15.680 --> 12:20.680\n in suggesting Iran rather than Iran, Iraq, Iraq.\n\n12:22.080 --> 12:24.960\n I think there's going to be a fit\n\n12:24.960 --> 12:27.440\n between certain ways of pronouncing these places\n\n12:27.440 --> 12:30.960\n and the position that Americans take about them.\n\n12:30.960 --> 12:35.960\n So it's more jarring when people say Iraq\n\n12:36.240 --> 12:41.240\n and it comes with a claim that a certain kind of person\n\n12:41.480 --> 12:43.440\n should be the victim of violence or.\n\n12:43.440 --> 12:44.560\n Yeah, that's fascinating.\n\n12:44.560 --> 12:47.040\n It's kind of like talking about the Democratic Party\n\n12:47.040 --> 12:48.440\n or the Democrat Party.\n\n12:48.440 --> 12:51.720\n It's sometimes using certain kind of terminology\n\n12:51.720 --> 12:56.720\n to make a little bit of a sort of implied statement\n\n12:57.720 --> 12:58.680\n about your beliefs.\n\n12:58.680 --> 12:59.520\n That's fascinating.\n\n12:59.520 --> 13:02.640\n Yeah, I mean, I think when I hear Iraq and Iran,\n\n13:02.640 --> 13:04.840\n I mean, I think it, yeah, is it intentional\n\n13:04.840 --> 13:07.280\n in the case of a Democrat or is it just a,\n\n13:07.280 --> 13:08.120\n you know, and it's a whatever.\n\n13:08.120 --> 13:10.560\n Again, I think most Iranians and Afghans people I know\n\n13:10.560 --> 13:12.880\n have been very cool about that.\n\n13:12.880 --> 13:15.440\n What annoys Afghans now, I can say,\n\n13:15.440 --> 13:16.280\n I think it's fair to say,\n\n13:16.280 --> 13:18.320\n I don't mean to speak for many people,\n\n13:18.320 --> 13:20.080\n for the entire group of people,\n\n13:20.080 --> 13:23.240\n but I can just share with our non Afghan friends.\n\n13:24.360 --> 13:28.600\n The term Afghani is a kind of term of offense\n\n13:28.600 --> 13:29.920\n because that's the name of the currency.\n\n13:29.920 --> 13:34.400\n And so lots of people ask, you know, why having,\n\n13:34.400 --> 13:36.600\n especially again, it's more directed at Americans\n\n13:36.600 --> 13:38.400\n because, you know, we've been so deeply involved\n\n13:38.400 --> 13:40.920\n in that country obviously for the last 20 years, right?\n\n13:40.920 --> 13:43.360\n So Afghans ask why after 20 years,\n\n13:43.360 --> 13:45.320\n are you still calling us the wrong name?\n\n13:45.320 --> 13:47.360\n What is the right name of somebody?\n\n13:47.360 --> 13:48.440\n They prefer Afghans.\n\n13:48.440 --> 13:49.280\n Afghans.\n\n13:49.280 --> 13:52.160\n Yeah, and Afghani is the name of the currency.\n\n13:52.160 --> 13:53.000\n And so.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:54.000\n I just dodged a bullet\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:54.840\n because I was gonna say Afghans.\n\n13:54.840 --> 13:56.040\n That's cool, no, no, no, yeah, I hear you.\n\n13:56.040 --> 13:57.280\n That's really great to know.\n\n13:57.280 --> 13:59.360\n Yeah, and it's, again, I think,\n\n13:59.360 --> 14:02.240\n but I would emphasize that people are quite open\n\n14:02.240 --> 14:06.160\n and, you know, it's a whole region of incredible diversity\n\n14:06.160 --> 14:09.800\n and respect for linguistic pluralism actually.\n\n14:09.800 --> 14:11.200\n So I think that, you know,\n\n14:11.200 --> 14:14.240\n but I also appreciate that in this context,\n\n14:14.240 --> 14:16.120\n when there's a lot of pain, you know,\n\n14:16.120 --> 14:18.840\n in the Afghan diaspora community in particular,\n\n14:18.840 --> 14:22.000\n you know, being called the wrong name after 20 years\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:24.800\n when they already feel so betrayed at this moment,\n\n14:24.800 --> 14:25.760\n you know, just kind of,\n\n14:25.760 --> 14:27.960\n if one follows this on social media,\n\n14:27.960 --> 14:32.160\n that is one kind of hot wire, right?\n\n14:32.160 --> 14:35.400\n Yeah, so the reason I ask about pronunciation\n\n14:35.400 --> 14:37.360\n is because, yes, it is true\n\n14:37.360 --> 14:39.880\n that there are certain things when mispronounced\n\n14:39.880 --> 14:42.800\n kind of reveal that you don't care enough\n\n14:42.800 --> 14:44.320\n to pronounce correctly.\n\n14:44.320 --> 14:47.040\n So I don't know enough to pronounce correctly\n\n14:47.040 --> 14:49.760\n and you dismiss the culture and the people,\n\n14:49.760 --> 14:53.360\n which I think as per your writing is something that,\n\n14:54.960 --> 14:57.160\n if it's okay, I'll go with Afghanistan\n\n14:57.160 --> 14:58.480\n just because I'm used to it.\n\n14:58.480 --> 15:01.520\n I say Iraq, Iran, but I say Afghanistan.\n\n15:01.520 --> 15:02.880\n Yeah, that's great.\n\n15:02.880 --> 15:04.560\n As you do in your writing,\n\n15:04.560 --> 15:07.360\n Afghanistan suffers from much misunderstanding\n\n15:07.360 --> 15:08.640\n from the rest of the world.\n\n15:08.640 --> 15:13.640\n But back to our discussion of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,\n\n15:13.800 --> 15:17.600\n the whole region that gives us context\n\n15:17.600 --> 15:18.880\n for the events of 9 11.\n\n15:18.880 --> 15:20.280\n Right, right.\n\n15:20.280 --> 15:21.600\n So yeah, if we go back to that day\n\n15:21.600 --> 15:23.880\n and the weeks that followed,\n\n15:23.880 --> 15:26.480\n in my mind went to the community I knew in Tashkent,\n\n15:28.040 --> 15:28.880\n which was interesting.\n\n15:28.880 --> 15:29.800\n I mean, they were,\n\n15:29.800 --> 15:33.080\n so Islam was the focal point of our conversation in the US\n\n15:33.080 --> 15:34.040\n about 9 11, right?\n\n15:34.040 --> 15:36.280\n Everyone to know what was the relationship\n\n15:36.280 --> 15:39.840\n between the civic violence and that religious tradition\n\n15:39.840 --> 15:44.840\n with its 1 billion plus followers across the globe, right?\n\n15:45.160 --> 15:47.000\n That became the issue, of course,\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.400\n for American security institutions,\n\n15:49.400 --> 15:53.440\n for local state and police institutions, right?\n\n15:53.440 --> 15:54.320\n I mean, it became the,\n\n15:54.320 --> 15:55.560\n I think it was the question\n\n15:55.560 --> 15:56.680\n that most Americans had on their mind.\n\n15:56.680 --> 15:59.760\n So again, I didn't imagine myself as someone\n\n15:59.760 --> 16:00.840\n who had all the answers, of course,\n\n16:00.840 --> 16:02.520\n but given my background\n\n16:02.520 --> 16:04.600\n and coming at this from Russian history,\n\n16:04.600 --> 16:06.840\n coming at this from studying empire\n\n16:06.840 --> 16:09.040\n and trying to think about the region broadly,\n\n16:10.080 --> 16:12.840\n I was very alarmed at the way that the conversation went.\n\n16:12.840 --> 16:13.880\n Can I ask you a question?\n\n16:13.880 --> 16:18.880\n What was your feeling on that morning of 9 11?\n\n16:19.120 --> 16:20.240\n Who did this?\n\n16:20.240 --> 16:22.520\n Isn't that a natural feeling?\n\n16:22.520 --> 16:25.640\n It's coupled with fear of what's next,\n\n16:25.640 --> 16:27.160\n especially when you're in DC,\n\n16:27.160 --> 16:28.680\n but also who is this?\n\n16:28.680 --> 16:30.280\n Is this an accident?\n\n16:30.280 --> 16:32.040\n Is this a deliberate terrorist attack?\n\n16:32.040 --> 16:34.960\n Is this domestic?\n\n16:34.960 --> 16:37.440\n What were your thoughts of the options\n\n16:37.440 --> 16:41.040\n and the internal ranking given your expertise?\n\n16:41.040 --> 16:44.040\n I suppose I was taken by the narrative\n\n16:44.040 --> 16:46.400\n that this was international.\n\n16:46.400 --> 16:47.920\n I mean, I'd also lived in New York\n\n16:47.920 --> 16:50.760\n during one of the first bombings in 94\n\n16:50.760 --> 16:52.240\n of the World Trade Center.\n\n16:52.240 --> 16:53.920\n So it was clear to me that a radical community\n\n16:53.920 --> 16:58.280\n had really fixed New York as part of their imagination of,\n\n16:58.280 --> 17:03.200\n and I immediately thought it was a kind of blow\n\n17:03.200 --> 17:04.320\n to American power.\n\n17:04.320 --> 17:08.840\n And I was drawn by the symbolism of it.\n\n17:08.840 --> 17:09.680\n If you think of it as an act,\n\n17:09.680 --> 17:13.120\n it was a kind of an act of speech, if you will,\n\n17:13.120 --> 17:16.840\n a kind of a way of speaking to,\n\n17:16.840 --> 17:18.560\n from a position of relative weakness,\n\n17:18.560 --> 17:21.440\n speaking to an imperial power.\n\n17:21.440 --> 17:25.760\n And I saw it as a kind of symbolic speech act of that\n\n17:25.760 --> 17:28.960\n with horrific real world consequences\n\n17:28.960 --> 17:30.960\n for all those innocent victims,\n\n17:30.960 --> 17:32.000\n for the firemen, for the police,\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.560\n and just the horror of the moment.\n\n17:35.600 --> 17:39.640\n So I did see it as transcending the United States,\n\n17:39.640 --> 17:42.840\n but I did not see it as really having anything necessarily\n\n17:42.840 --> 17:45.360\n to do fundamentally about Afghanistan\n\n17:45.360 --> 17:48.000\n and the history of the region that I'd been studying\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:49.760\n and the community people that I knew\n\n17:49.760 --> 17:52.360\n who were not particularly religious.\n\n17:52.360 --> 17:54.200\n The guys I hung out with actually wore me out\n\n17:54.200 --> 17:56.120\n because they wanted to go out every night.\n\n17:56.120 --> 17:57.880\n They wanted to party every night.\n\n17:57.880 --> 17:58.720\n Drinking?\n\n17:58.720 --> 17:59.560\n Yep.\n\n17:59.560 --> 18:00.560\n We had discussions about alcohol.\n\n18:00.560 --> 18:02.720\n I mean, Uzbekistan is famous for its, you know.\n\n18:02.720 --> 18:03.560\n Drinking.\n\n18:03.560 --> 18:04.400\n It's drinking.\n\n18:04.400 --> 18:05.220\n You know, it's.\n\n18:05.220 --> 18:06.060\n That's something to look forward to.\n\n18:06.060 --> 18:08.360\n So I do want to travel to that part of the world.\n\n18:08.360 --> 18:11.400\n When was the last time you were in that part of the world?\n\n18:11.400 --> 18:12.680\n Early 2000s.\n\n18:12.680 --> 18:14.840\n Well, in the mid 2000s, 2010s.\n\n18:14.840 --> 18:16.880\n So wait, so by the way, what drinking?\n\n18:16.880 --> 18:17.720\n Vodka?\n\n18:17.720 --> 18:20.040\n What's the, what's the weapon of choice?\n\n18:20.040 --> 18:25.040\n Uzbekistan has incorporated vodka as the choice.\n\n18:26.240 --> 18:28.280\n And that, and it informs, you know, and it's,\n\n18:28.280 --> 18:30.040\n but the fascinating thing, you know, as a student,\n\n18:30.040 --> 18:32.520\n is what you're observing as a non Muslim.\n\n18:32.520 --> 18:34.200\n You know, I'm a non Russian.\n\n18:34.200 --> 18:38.840\n I'm, this is all, you know, culturally new to me.\n\n18:38.840 --> 18:40.800\n And I'm, you know, a student of all that, right?\n\n18:40.800 --> 18:42.520\n As a grad student doing my work there.\n\n18:42.520 --> 18:45.280\n So you're like Jane Goodall of vodka and Russia.\n\n18:45.280 --> 18:46.120\n That's right.\n\n18:46.120 --> 18:46.940\n You're just observing.\n\n18:46.940 --> 18:47.780\n That's right.\n\n18:47.780 --> 18:48.620\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n18:48.620 --> 18:51.280\n You get the Samogon, the grass vodka.\n\n18:51.280 --> 18:53.360\n You get, you know, I have,\n\n18:53.360 --> 18:56.640\n I've had some long nights on the Kazakhstan frontier\n\n18:56.640 --> 19:00.120\n that I'm not proud of, you know.\n\n19:00.120 --> 19:01.520\n But you got to know the people\n\n19:01.520 --> 19:03.000\n and some of them from, from, from.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:03.840\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n19:03.840 --> 19:05.360\n But intellectually, so the thing, I mean,\n\n19:05.360 --> 19:08.040\n the fascinating thing there was that, and just as a,\n\n19:08.040 --> 19:09.920\n I mean, there's a whole, you know, I'm a historian, right?\n\n19:09.920 --> 19:14.400\n But there, there are great contributions by, you know,\n\n19:14.400 --> 19:15.880\n anthropologists and ethnographers who,\n\n19:15.880 --> 19:16.920\n who've gone across the planet\n\n19:16.920 --> 19:20.000\n and try to understand how Muslims understand the tradition\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:21.600\n at different contexts.\n\n19:21.600 --> 19:24.320\n So many Uzbeks will say, you know,\n\n19:25.680 --> 19:27.200\n this is part of our national culture\n\n19:27.200 --> 19:29.760\n to drink and eat as we please, right?\n\n19:29.760 --> 19:31.620\n And yet I'm a very devout Muslim.\n\n19:31.620 --> 19:33.960\n And so of course you can encounter\n\n19:33.960 --> 19:37.400\n other Muslim communities who won't touch alcohol, right?\n\n19:37.400 --> 19:40.120\n But it's become kind of, I think it's very much,\n\n19:40.120 --> 19:42.360\n you know, Soviet culture left a deep impression\n\n19:42.360 --> 19:43.200\n in each of these places.\n\n19:43.200 --> 19:45.360\n And so there are ways of thinking,\n\n19:45.360 --> 19:49.760\n ways of performing, ways of, you know, enjoying oneself\n\n19:49.760 --> 19:53.320\n that are shared across Soviet and former Soviet space\n\n19:53.320 --> 19:54.640\n to this day, right?\n\n19:54.640 --> 19:57.800\n And you've written also about Muslims in the Soviet Union.\n\n19:57.800 --> 19:59.120\n That's right.\n\n19:59.120 --> 20:02.280\n There's an article that, there was a paywall,\n\n20:02.280 --> 20:04.920\n so I couldn't read it and I really want to read it.\n\n20:04.920 --> 20:09.920\n It's a Moscow in the mosque or something like that.\n\n20:11.840 --> 20:15.000\n By the way, just another tangent on a tangent.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.280\n So I bought all your books.\n\n20:16.280 --> 20:18.120\n I love them very much.\n\n20:18.120 --> 20:21.560\n One of the reasons I bought them and read many parts\n\n20:21.560 --> 20:24.320\n is because they're easy to buy.\n\n20:24.320 --> 20:28.560\n Unlike articles, every single website has a paywall.\n\n20:28.560 --> 20:32.720\n So it's very frustrating to read brilliant scholars\n\n20:32.720 --> 20:33.700\n such as yourself.\n\n20:35.280 --> 20:37.520\n I wish there was one fee I could pay everywhere.\n\n20:37.520 --> 20:38.840\n I don't care what that fee is,\n\n20:38.840 --> 20:41.200\n where it gives, allows me to read\n\n20:41.200 --> 20:42.200\n some of your brilliant writing.\n\n20:42.200 --> 20:43.040\n No, no, thank you, I hear you.\n\n20:43.040 --> 20:46.480\n I think moving toward more kind of open source\n\n20:47.360 --> 20:49.120\n formatting stuff I think is what a lot of journals\n\n20:49.120 --> 20:51.760\n are thinking about now and I think it's definitely\n\n20:51.760 --> 20:54.520\n for the kind of democratization of knowledge and scholarship\n\n20:54.520 --> 20:55.940\n that's definitely an important thing\n\n20:55.940 --> 20:56.900\n that we should all think about.\n\n20:56.900 --> 21:01.200\n And I think we need to exert pressure on these publishers\n\n21:01.200 --> 21:02.600\n to do that, so I appreciate that.\n\n21:02.600 --> 21:03.840\n This is what I'm doing here.\n\n21:03.840 --> 21:06.520\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, good, good, I appreciate it.\n\n21:06.520 --> 21:11.520\n So your thought was Afghanistan is not going to be\n\n21:11.520 --> 21:14.960\n to be the center, the source of where.\n\n21:14.960 --> 21:16.960\n It's not the center of this and invading that country\n\n21:16.960 --> 21:21.960\n isn't gonna fix the toxic milestone of politics\n\n21:22.160 --> 21:25.200\n that produced 9 11, right?\n\n21:25.200 --> 21:26.520\n I'm just thinking of some of the personalities,\n\n21:26.520 --> 21:28.880\n just thinking about going back to the Tashkent story\n\n21:28.880 --> 21:29.800\n which I'll end with.\n\n21:29.800 --> 21:34.060\n I mean, just observing real Muslims doing things\n\n21:34.060 --> 21:35.400\n and then asking questions about it\n\n21:35.400 --> 21:39.000\n and trying to understand through their eyes\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.920\n what the tradition means to them.\n\n21:40.920 --> 21:43.680\n And then we had a very narrow conversation\n\n21:43.680 --> 21:48.320\n about what Islam is that generated, immediately exploded\n\n21:48.320 --> 21:50.120\n on the day of 9 11, right?\n\n21:50.120 --> 21:53.800\n And then of course, I think the antipathy toward Islam\n\n21:53.800 --> 21:58.800\n and Muslims was informed by racism, informed by xenophobia.\n\n21:59.920 --> 22:03.000\n So it became a perfect storm I think of demonization\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:06.180\n that didn't sit with what I knew about the tradition\n\n22:06.180 --> 22:08.380\n and with actual people that I had known\n\n22:08.380 --> 22:10.960\n because then going back to, I mean, there were other friends\n\n22:10.960 --> 22:13.000\n and encounters and so on, but just thinking about Afghanistan\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.360\n and Tashkent for a moment, I mean,\n\n22:15.360 --> 22:18.360\n just thought about my friends who had been,\n\n22:18.360 --> 22:20.600\n who had suffered a great deal in their short lives,\n\n22:20.600 --> 22:24.680\n who had been cast aside from country to country,\n\n22:24.680 --> 22:26.680\n but had found a place in Tashkent\n\n22:26.680 --> 22:28.680\n with some relative stability.\n\n22:28.680 --> 22:31.040\n And they wanted to go out every night\n\n22:31.040 --> 22:33.480\n and they explained, one friend,\n\n22:33.480 --> 22:34.840\n we talked about it with the alcohol and all that\n\n22:34.840 --> 22:37.260\n and he didn't get crazy, but he was like,\n\n22:37.260 --> 22:38.880\n you can drink, but just don't get drunk.\n\n22:38.880 --> 22:41.340\n That's permissible within Islam, right?\n\n22:42.720 --> 22:44.960\n And he was an ethnic Pashtun.\n\n22:44.960 --> 22:46.680\n I think Uzbeks had a different view,\n\n22:47.640 --> 22:49.840\n often the more vodka the better,\n\n22:49.840 --> 22:51.840\n and it doesn't violate, as I understand Islam.\n\n22:51.840 --> 22:54.080\n So even, it's kind of a silly example,\n\n22:54.080 --> 22:56.160\n but it's just an illustration of the ways in which\n\n22:56.160 --> 22:57.980\n different communities, different generations,\n\n22:57.980 --> 23:01.520\n different people can come at this very complex rich tradition\n\n23:01.520 --> 23:02.500\n in so many different ways.\n\n23:02.500 --> 23:06.120\n So obviously, whatever kind of scholar you are,\n\n23:06.120 --> 23:08.320\n or any kind of expert, whatever,\n\n23:08.320 --> 23:10.880\n it's always disconcerting to see\n\n23:10.880 --> 23:13.800\n your field of specialization be flattened, right?\n\n23:13.800 --> 23:15.120\n And then be flattened and then be turned\n\n23:15.120 --> 23:18.480\n to arguments for violence, right?\n\n23:18.480 --> 23:22.280\n Mixed up with the natural human feelings of hate.\n\n23:22.280 --> 23:23.120\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n23:23.120 --> 23:25.480\n And depression. And hurt at that moment, and pain.\n\n23:25.480 --> 23:28.080\n So, I mean, that day I vividly remember,\n\n23:28.080 --> 23:32.800\n I sat with other PhD historians in different fields.\n\n23:32.800 --> 23:35.740\n We, oddly enough, had lunch that day\n\n23:35.740 --> 23:37.320\n and it kind of deserted Washington.\n\n23:37.320 --> 23:39.760\n Some place was open when we went.\n\n23:39.760 --> 23:40.600\n And we just thought, you know,\n\n23:40.600 --> 23:42.480\n this is going to kind of open up\n\n23:42.480 --> 23:45.800\n like a great mall of destruction.\n\n23:45.800 --> 23:50.800\n And, you know, the American state is going to destroy\n\n23:51.020 --> 23:53.800\n and it's going to destroy in this geography.\n\n23:53.800 --> 23:56.560\n And I thought that was misplaced for lots of reasons.\n\n23:56.560 --> 23:59.200\n And then I think if one, you know,\n\n23:59.200 --> 24:02.560\n I'd been doing some research on Afghanistan then,\n\n24:02.560 --> 24:03.640\n I was kind of shifting to the South\n\n24:03.640 --> 24:08.000\n and I'd been looking at the Taliban from afar\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:08.840\n for some years.\n\n24:08.840 --> 24:11.800\n And, you know, I think it's clear now\n\n24:11.800 --> 24:14.080\n that in retrospect there were opportunities\n\n24:14.080 --> 24:16.560\n for alternative policies at that moment.\n\n24:16.560 --> 24:20.880\n So what should the conversation have been like?\n\n24:20.880 --> 24:23.560\n What should we have done differently?\n\n24:23.560 --> 24:28.560\n Because, you know, from a perspective of the time,\n\n24:28.560 --> 24:33.440\n the United States was invaded by a foreign force.\n\n24:33.440 --> 24:35.080\n What is the proper response\n\n24:35.080 --> 24:36.760\n or what is the proper conversation\n\n24:36.760 --> 24:39.080\n about the proper response at the time, you think?\n\n24:39.080 --> 24:41.300\n You know, I know my colleague at Stanford,\n\n24:41.300 --> 24:44.600\n Condoleezza Rice would tell me this is above my pay grade.\n\n24:44.600 --> 24:46.640\n And, you know, she makes a point in her classes\n\n24:46.640 --> 24:50.240\n to talk about how difficult decision making is\n\n24:50.240 --> 24:52.200\n under such intense pressure.\n\n24:52.200 --> 24:53.900\n And I appreciate that.\n\n24:53.900 --> 24:57.420\n You know, I am a historian who sits safely in my office.\n\n24:57.420 --> 24:58.720\n I don't like battlefields.\n\n24:58.720 --> 25:01.480\n I don't like taking risks.\n\n25:01.480 --> 25:02.960\n So I can see all those limits.\n\n25:02.960 --> 25:05.280\n You know, I'm not a military expert.\n\n25:05.280 --> 25:07.200\n I've been accused of being a spy wherever I've gone\n\n25:07.200 --> 25:08.040\n because of the way I look\n\n25:08.040 --> 25:10.320\n and because of my nationality and so on, but I'm not a spy.\n\n25:10.320 --> 25:12.760\n So I defer, you know, I respect the expertise\n\n25:12.760 --> 25:13.720\n of all those communities.\n\n25:13.720 --> 25:16.960\n But I think they acted out of ignorance.\n\n25:16.960 --> 25:19.680\n They acted, I think, because, I mean, you think of the,\n\n25:19.680 --> 25:22.840\n in a way there was a compensatory aspect\n\n25:22.840 --> 25:23.840\n of this decision making.\n\n25:23.840 --> 25:27.580\n I mean, the Bush administration failed.\n\n25:27.580 --> 25:29.580\n This was an extraordinary failure, right?\n\n25:29.580 --> 25:30.420\n So if we start.\n\n25:30.420 --> 25:31.240\n In which way?\n\n25:31.240 --> 25:32.080\n Can we break down the nation?\n\n25:32.080 --> 25:32.920\n Of intelligence.\n\n25:32.920 --> 25:33.760\n I mean, if they, you know,\n\n25:33.760 --> 25:35.760\n if you follow the story of Richard Clarke.\n\n25:36.840 --> 25:37.800\n Who's Richard Clarke?\n\n25:37.800 --> 25:40.840\n He was a national security expert\n\n25:40.840 --> 25:43.400\n who was tasked with following Al Qaeda,\n\n25:43.400 --> 25:47.280\n who had produced a dossier under the Clinton administration\n\n25:47.280 --> 25:50.720\n that he passed on to the George W. Bush administration.\n\n25:50.720 --> 25:53.440\n And if you look at the work of Condoleezza Rice,\n\n25:53.440 --> 25:56.760\n she wrote a very famous, I think, unpaywalled\n\n25:56.760 --> 25:58.680\n foreign affairs article that you can read,\n\n25:58.680 --> 26:02.840\n announcing the George W. Bush foreign policy kind of outlook.\n\n26:02.840 --> 26:05.280\n And it was all about great powers.\n\n26:05.280 --> 26:06.480\n It was about the rise of China.\n\n26:06.480 --> 26:07.520\n It was about Russia.\n\n26:07.520 --> 26:10.920\n I mean, there's definitely a kind of hangover\n\n26:10.920 --> 26:15.920\n of those who missed having Russia as the boogeyman.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:17.660\n Who spoke, you know, the Clinton administration\n\n26:17.660 --> 26:19.920\n repeated again and again the idea of making sure\n\n26:19.920 --> 26:21.840\n the bear stayed in his cage.\n\n26:22.860 --> 26:26.540\n Which is why the United States threw a lifeline\n\n26:26.540 --> 26:31.120\n to the Central Asian states, hoping to have pipelines,\n\n26:31.120 --> 26:34.580\n hoping to shore up their national sovereignty\n\n26:34.580 --> 26:39.120\n as a way of containing Russia initially, but also Iran,\n\n26:39.120 --> 26:42.160\n you know, which sits to the south and west.\n\n26:42.160 --> 26:43.840\n And then peripherally looking down the road\n\n26:43.840 --> 26:45.640\n to China to the east.\n\n26:45.640 --> 26:50.200\n So the bear is what, like Russia?\n\n26:50.200 --> 26:53.200\n Or is it kind of like some weird combination\n\n26:53.200 --> 26:55.360\n of Russia, Iran, and China?\n\n26:55.360 --> 27:00.240\n The bear is Russia and Russia is this thing.\n\n27:00.240 --> 27:01.760\n I'm trying to characterize the imagination\n\n27:01.760 --> 27:04.000\n of some of these national security figures.\n\n27:04.920 --> 27:07.240\n This is an image formed in the Cold War.\n\n27:07.240 --> 27:09.480\n I mean, it has deeper seeds in European\n\n27:09.480 --> 27:12.160\n and Western intellectual thought that go back\n\n27:12.160 --> 27:17.160\n at least to the 1850s and the reign of Tsar Nicholas I.\n\n27:17.600 --> 27:21.140\n When we first get this language about the Russian Empire\n\n27:21.140 --> 27:24.960\n as this kind of evil polity.\n\n27:24.960 --> 27:28.080\n Obviously this was a kind of pillar of Reaganism.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:30.960\n But the Clinton folks kept that alive.\n\n27:30.960 --> 27:34.040\n They wanted to make sure that American power\n\n27:34.040 --> 27:36.080\n would be unmatched.\n\n27:36.080 --> 27:39.400\n And they, being creatures of the Cold War themselves,\n\n27:39.400 --> 27:42.860\n they looked to Russia as a recession power\n\n27:42.860 --> 27:45.560\n well before Putin was even thought of.\n\n27:45.560 --> 27:49.440\n Yeah, I mean, this is, you mentioned one deep,\n\n27:49.440 --> 27:52.140\n profound historical piece in Rambo.\n\n27:52.140 --> 27:55.640\n It's probably, this conflict has to do\n\n27:55.640 --> 27:57.280\n with another Sylvester Stallone movie,\n\n27:57.280 --> 28:00.520\n a Rocky IV, which is also historically accurate\n\n28:00.520 --> 28:03.540\n and based on, it's basically a documentary.\n\n28:03.540 --> 28:07.440\n So there is something about the American power,\n\n28:07.440 --> 28:10.140\n even at the level of Condoleezza Rice,\n\n28:10.140 --> 28:15.140\n these respected deep kind of leaders and thinkers\n\n28:15.760 --> 28:17.560\n about history and the future,\n\n28:17.560 --> 28:20.440\n where they like to have competition\n\n28:20.440 --> 28:25.440\n with other superpowers and almost conjure up superpowers,\n\n28:26.520 --> 28:31.280\n even when those countries don't maybe at the time\n\n28:31.280 --> 28:33.520\n at least deserve the label of superpower.\n\n28:33.520 --> 28:34.360\n That's right, great point.\n\n28:34.360 --> 28:35.760\n Yeah, they're all some points.\n\n28:35.760 --> 28:39.400\n So yeah, I mean, Russia was, I think many, many exports.\n\n28:39.400 --> 28:42.420\n I mean, my mentor at Princeton, Stephen Cotkin,\n\n28:43.320 --> 28:45.320\n was then writing great things about how,\n\n28:46.280 --> 28:49.600\n if you look at Russia's economy, the scale of its GDP,\n\n28:49.600 --> 28:52.240\n its capacity to actually act globally,\n\n28:52.240 --> 28:54.160\n it's all quite limited.\n\n28:54.160 --> 28:56.680\n But Condoleezza Rice and the people around her\n\n28:58.360 --> 29:00.080\n came into power with George W. Bush,\n\n29:00.080 --> 29:03.560\n thinking that the foreign policy challenges of her era\n\n29:03.560 --> 29:06.480\n would be those of the past, right?\n\n29:06.480 --> 29:08.120\n Richard Clark and others within the administration\n\n29:08.120 --> 29:10.440\n warned that, in fact, there is this group\n\n29:10.440 --> 29:12.940\n that has declared war against the United States\n\n29:12.940 --> 29:14.760\n and they are coming for us.\n\n29:14.760 --> 29:17.280\n The FBI had been following these people around\n\n29:17.280 --> 29:18.120\n for many months.\n\n29:18.120 --> 29:21.880\n So by the time George W. Bush comes to power,\n\n29:21.880 --> 29:23.800\n lots of Al Qaeda activists are, well, not lots,\n\n29:23.800 --> 29:26.120\n but perhaps a dozen or so,\n\n29:26.120 --> 29:30.000\n are already training in the United States, right?\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:31.800\n And what we knew immediately from the biographies\n\n29:31.800 --> 29:34.400\n of some of the characters of the attackers of 9.11,\n\n29:34.400 --> 29:37.120\n it was a hodgepodge of people from across the planet,\n\n29:37.120 --> 29:39.320\n but most of them were Saudi, right?\n\n29:39.320 --> 29:41.240\n And that was known very early on\n\n29:41.240 --> 29:43.240\n or presumed very early on.\n\n29:43.240 --> 29:44.520\n So again, if we go back to your big question\n\n29:44.520 --> 29:47.080\n about the geography, why Afghanistan?\n\n29:47.080 --> 29:48.240\n It didn't add up, right?\n\n29:48.240 --> 29:51.240\n It seemed to me that Afghanistan was a kind of soft target.\n\n29:51.240 --> 29:54.100\n It was a place to have explosions,\n\n29:54.100 --> 29:58.360\n to seemingly recapture American supremacy.\n\n29:58.360 --> 29:59.760\n And also, I think, you know, there was,\n\n29:59.760 --> 30:02.660\n in many quarters, there was a deep urge for revenge.\n\n30:02.660 --> 30:05.440\n And this was a place to have some casualties,\n\n30:05.440 --> 30:07.480\n have some explosions.\n\n30:07.480 --> 30:09.720\n And then I think, you know, restore the legitimacy\n\n30:09.720 --> 30:11.340\n of the Bush administration\n\n30:11.340 --> 30:14.060\n by showing that we are in charge, we will pay.\n\n30:14.060 --> 30:17.480\n And I think that was a very old fashioned punitive dimension,\n\n30:17.480 --> 30:19.280\n which rests upon the presumption\n\n30:19.280 --> 30:21.600\n that if we intimidate these people,\n\n30:21.600 --> 30:23.880\n they'll know not to try us again, right?\n\n30:23.880 --> 30:25.680\n All these, I would suggest, are all misreadings\n\n30:25.680 --> 30:28.360\n of an organization that was always global.\n\n30:28.360 --> 30:29.680\n It had no real center.\n\n30:29.680 --> 30:30.680\n I mean, it called itself the center.\n\n30:30.680 --> 30:32.880\n That's one way to translate Al Qaeda.\n\n30:32.880 --> 30:35.560\n But that center was really in the imagination.\n\n30:36.840 --> 30:39.240\n Bin Laden bounced around from country to country.\n\n30:40.120 --> 30:42.740\n And crucially, I think a dimension\n\n30:42.740 --> 30:45.200\n that I don't claim to know anything new about,\n\n30:45.200 --> 30:47.900\n but has endured as a kind of doubt,\n\n30:47.900 --> 30:50.360\n is the role of Saudi Arabia and the fact that, you know,\n\n30:50.360 --> 30:55.000\n the muscle in that operation of 9 11 was Saudi, right?\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.480\n I mean, this was a Saudi operation with,\n\n30:57.480 --> 31:00.400\n if one thinks, again, just on the basis of nationalities,\n\n31:00.400 --> 31:04.440\n Saudis, you know, an Egyptian or two, a Lebanese guy.\n\n31:04.440 --> 31:06.800\n And the Egyptian guy, you know,\n\n31:06.800 --> 31:08.640\n had been studying in Germany.\n\n31:08.640 --> 31:10.980\n He was an urban planner, right?\n\n31:10.980 --> 31:12.360\n So if one thinks of the imagination of this,\n\n31:12.360 --> 31:15.760\n I mean, in fact, if you look at the kind of typology\n\n31:15.760 --> 31:19.440\n of the figures who have led this radical movement,\n\n31:19.440 --> 31:22.000\n I mean, if you think of the global jihadists,\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:25.480\n they are mostly not religious scholars, right?\n\n31:25.480 --> 31:27.660\n Bin Laden was not a religious scholar.\n\n31:27.660 --> 31:29.200\n His training was an engineer.\n\n31:29.200 --> 31:30.160\n You know, some biographers claim\n\n31:30.160 --> 31:32.640\n that he was a playboy for much of his youth.\n\n31:32.640 --> 31:34.680\n But really, these ideas,\n\n31:34.680 --> 31:37.600\n I think that's probably why they chose the Twin Towers.\n\n31:37.600 --> 31:41.720\n I mean, this is an imagination fueled\n\n31:41.720 --> 31:43.880\n by training and engineering.\n\n31:43.880 --> 31:46.400\n I mean, a lot of the, you know, the sociology,\n\n31:46.400 --> 31:47.560\n if you do a kind of post biography\n\n31:47.560 --> 31:50.800\n of a lot of these leading jihadists,\n\n31:50.800 --> 31:53.160\n their backgrounds are not in Islamic scholarship,\n\n31:53.160 --> 31:54.560\n but actually in engineering\n\n31:54.560 --> 31:57.160\n and kind of practical sciences and professions.\n\n31:57.160 --> 31:59.260\n Medical doctors are among their ranks.\n\n32:00.400 --> 32:03.040\n And so there's long been a tension between Islamic scholars\n\n32:03.040 --> 32:05.360\n who devote their whole lives to study of texts\n\n32:05.360 --> 32:08.000\n and commentary and interpretation.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.640\n And then what some scholars call kind of new intellectuals,\n\n32:10.640 --> 32:12.400\n new Muslim authorities,\n\n32:12.400 --> 32:16.080\n who actually have secular university educations,\n\n32:16.080 --> 32:17.200\n often in the natural sciences\n\n32:17.200 --> 32:19.220\n or engineering and technical fields,\n\n32:19.220 --> 32:22.560\n who then bring that kind of mindset, if you will,\n\n32:22.560 --> 32:26.760\n to what Muslim scholars called the religious sciences,\n\n32:26.760 --> 32:30.600\n which are, you know, a field of kind of ambiguity\n\n32:30.600 --> 32:33.940\n and of gradation and of subtlety and nuance,\n\n32:33.940 --> 32:36.540\n and really of decades of training\n\n32:36.540 --> 32:39.840\n before one becomes authoritative to speak about issues\n\n32:39.840 --> 32:41.200\n like whether or not it's legitimate\n\n32:41.200 --> 32:43.260\n to take someone else's life.\n\n32:43.260 --> 32:47.420\n With the relation to Afghanistan, who was bin Laden?\n\n32:47.420 --> 32:49.320\n Bin Laden was a visitor.\n\n32:50.640 --> 32:52.700\n If you look at his whole life course,\n\n32:53.800 --> 32:55.760\n part of it is an enigma still.\n\n32:55.760 --> 32:59.880\n You know, he is from a Saudi elite family,\n\n32:59.880 --> 33:03.920\n but a family that kind of has a Yemeni Arabian sea\n\n33:03.920 --> 33:07.060\n kind of genealogy.\n\n33:07.060 --> 33:10.240\n So the family has no relationship to Afghanistan,\n\n33:10.240 --> 33:13.560\n past or present, except at some point in 1980s,\n\n33:13.560 --> 33:16.960\n when he went like thousands of other young Saudis,\n\n33:16.960 --> 33:20.720\n first to Pakistan, to places like Bashour on the border,\n\n33:20.720 --> 33:24.720\n where they wanted to aid the jihad in some capacity.\n\n33:25.760 --> 33:29.180\n And for the most part, the Arabs who went\n\n33:29.180 --> 33:32.140\n opened up hospitals, some opened up schools.\n\n33:32.140 --> 33:35.020\n The bin Laden family had long been\n\n33:35.020 --> 33:37.320\n based in engineering construction.\n\n33:37.320 --> 33:39.400\n So it's thought that he used some of those skills\n\n33:39.400 --> 33:42.420\n and resources and connections to build things.\n\n33:44.240 --> 33:48.240\n We have images of him firing a gun for show, right?\n\n33:48.240 --> 33:50.600\n It's not clear that he ever actually fired a gun\n\n33:50.600 --> 33:52.200\n in what we would call combat.\n\n33:53.900 --> 33:55.480\n Again, I could be corrected by this.\n\n33:55.480 --> 33:58.600\n And I think there are competing accounts of who he was.\n\n33:58.600 --> 34:01.200\n So he's kind of a, I mean, many of these figures\n\n34:01.200 --> 34:05.280\n who sit at the pinnacle of this world are fictive heroes\n\n34:05.280 --> 34:08.400\n that people map their aspirations onto, right?\n\n34:08.400 --> 34:10.400\n And so people like Mullah Omar,\n\n34:10.400 --> 34:13.300\n who was then head of the Taliban,\n\n34:13.300 --> 34:15.920\n was rarely seen in public.\n\n34:15.920 --> 34:17.680\n The current head of the Taliban\n\n34:17.680 --> 34:19.480\n is almost never seen in public.\n\n34:19.480 --> 34:22.240\n I mean, there's a kind of studied era of mystery\n\n34:22.240 --> 34:25.340\n that they've cultivated to make themselves available\n\n34:25.340 --> 34:27.720\n for all kinds of fantasies, right?\n\n34:27.720 --> 34:32.080\n Do you think he believed, so his religious beliefs,\n\n34:33.720 --> 34:38.720\n do you think he believed some of the more extreme things\n\n34:39.120 --> 34:42.320\n that enable him to commit terrorist acts?\n\n34:42.320 --> 34:44.000\n Maybe put another way,\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.960\n what makes a man want to become a terrorist?\n\n34:46.960 --> 34:50.400\n And what aspect of bin Laden made him want to be a terrorist?\n\n34:51.440 --> 34:52.520\n Great.\n\n34:52.520 --> 34:54.120\n I mean, let me offer some observations.\n\n34:54.120 --> 34:57.040\n I think there are others who know more about bin Laden\n\n34:57.040 --> 34:59.600\n and have far more expertise in Al Qaeda.\n\n34:59.600 --> 35:04.340\n So I'm coming at this in an adjacent way,\n\n35:04.340 --> 35:06.520\n kind of from Afghanistan and from my historical training.\n\n35:06.520 --> 35:10.820\n So this is my two cents, so bear with me.\n\n35:10.820 --> 35:12.680\n I don't have the authoritative account for this.\n\n35:12.680 --> 35:14.040\n Which in itself is fascinating\n\n35:14.040 --> 35:16.960\n because you're a historian of Afghanistan,\n\n35:16.960 --> 35:21.160\n and the fact that bin Laden isn't a huge part\n\n35:21.160 --> 35:23.960\n of your focus of study just means\n\n35:23.960 --> 35:28.680\n that bin Laden is not a key part of the history of Afghanistan\n\n35:28.680 --> 35:31.000\n except that America made him a key part\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:32.280\n of the history of Afghanistan.\n\n35:32.280 --> 35:33.300\n I would endorse that.\n\n35:33.300 --> 35:34.140\n Definitely, that's it.\n\n35:34.140 --> 35:37.140\n I mean, you've put it in a very pithy, pithy way.\n\n35:37.140 --> 35:40.480\n Yeah, so listen, so he was an engineer.\n\n35:40.480 --> 35:42.520\n He was said to be a playboy\n\n35:42.520 --> 35:45.280\n who spent a lot of cash from his family.\n\n35:45.280 --> 35:48.240\n Like many young Saudis and from some other countries,\n\n35:48.240 --> 35:50.560\n he was inspired by this idea\n\n35:50.560 --> 35:52.760\n that there was jihad in Afghanistan.\n\n35:52.760 --> 35:55.840\n It was gonna take down one of the two superpowers,\n\n35:55.840 --> 35:57.200\n the Soviet Union,\n\n35:57.200 --> 36:01.720\n who the Red Army did murder hundreds of thousands,\n\n36:01.720 --> 36:05.680\n perhaps as many as 2 million Afghan civilians\n\n36:05.680 --> 36:06.880\n during that conflict.\n\n36:07.720 --> 36:12.720\n It's very plausible and very completely understandable\n\n36:13.500 --> 36:16.660\n that many young people would see that cause\n\n36:16.660 --> 36:21.660\n as the righteous, pious fighters for jihad\n\n36:21.660 --> 36:23.820\n who call themselves mujahideen\n\n36:23.820 --> 36:26.420\n are ready against this evil empire\n\n36:26.420 --> 36:30.220\n of a godless Soviet empire that,\n\n36:30.220 --> 36:31.060\n I mean, there's even confusion\n\n36:31.060 --> 36:32.300\n about what the Soviets wanted.\n\n36:32.300 --> 36:34.380\n Now we know much more about what the Kremlin wanted,\n\n36:34.380 --> 36:36.220\n what Brezhnev wanted,\n\n36:36.220 --> 36:37.540\n and how the Soviet elite thought about it\n\n36:37.540 --> 36:39.180\n because we have many more of their records.\n\n36:39.180 --> 36:42.700\n But from the outside, for Jimmy Carter and then for Reagan,\n\n36:42.700 --> 36:47.700\n it looked like the Soviets were making a move on South Asia\n\n36:47.860 --> 36:50.860\n because they wanted to get to the warm water ports,\n\n36:50.860 --> 36:52.660\n which Russians always want supposedly, right?\n\n36:52.660 --> 36:56.120\n And it was kind of a move to take over our oil\n\n36:56.120 --> 36:58.780\n and to assert world domination, right?\n\n36:58.780 --> 37:01.500\n So there are lots of ways in which this looked like\n\n37:01.500 --> 37:03.300\n good versus evil in Congress.\n\n37:03.300 --> 37:06.880\n It looked like kind of Vietnam again,\n\n37:06.880 --> 37:08.920\n but this time this is our chance to get them.\n\n37:08.920 --> 37:11.380\n And there are lots of great quotes,\n\n37:11.380 --> 37:13.900\n I mean, disturbing, but really revealing quotes\n\n37:13.900 --> 37:16.300\n that American policymakers made about\n\n37:16.300 --> 37:18.980\n wanting to give the Soviets their Vietnam.\n\n37:18.980 --> 37:23.320\n So the CIA funneled hundreds of millions of dollars\n\n37:23.320 --> 37:25.660\n into this project to back the Mujahideen,\n\n37:25.660 --> 37:27.580\n who Reagan called freedom fighters.\n\n37:27.580 --> 37:29.460\n And so Bin Laden was part of that universe,\n\n37:29.460 --> 37:30.300\n he's part of that,\n\n37:30.300 --> 37:33.520\n he's swimming in the ocean of these Afghan Mujahideen\n\n37:33.520 --> 37:36.740\n who out of size did 95% of the fighting,\n\n37:36.740 --> 37:37.740\n they're the ones who died,\n\n37:37.740 --> 37:40.500\n they're the ones who defeated the Red Army, right?\n\n37:40.500 --> 37:43.100\n The Arabs who were there did a little fighting,\n\n37:43.100 --> 37:45.740\n but a lot of it was for their purposes.\n\n37:45.740 --> 37:47.100\n It was to get experience,\n\n37:47.100 --> 37:50.300\n it was to kind of create their reputations\n\n37:50.300 --> 37:52.660\n like Bin Laden began to force for himself\n\n37:52.660 --> 37:55.260\n of being spoken for a global project.\n\n37:55.260 --> 37:57.020\n Because by the late 80s,\n\n37:57.020 --> 37:58.860\n when Bin Laden I think was more active\n\n37:58.860 --> 38:02.840\n and began conspiring with people from other Arab countries,\n\n38:02.840 --> 38:06.020\n the idea that Gorbachev came to power in 85,\n\n38:06.020 --> 38:07.100\n he's like, let's get out of here,\n\n38:07.100 --> 38:09.380\n this is draining the Soviet budget,\n\n38:09.380 --> 38:10.460\n it's an embarrassment,\n\n38:11.500 --> 38:13.220\n we didn't think about this properly,\n\n38:13.220 --> 38:17.220\n let's focus on restoring the party\n\n38:17.220 --> 38:19.300\n and strengthening the Soviet Union,\n\n38:19.300 --> 38:20.900\n let's get out of this costly war,\n\n38:20.900 --> 38:23.780\n it's a waste, it's not worth it,\n\n38:23.780 --> 38:24.620\n where you don't lose anything\n\n38:24.620 --> 38:26.860\n by getting out of Afghanistan.\n\n38:26.860 --> 38:31.860\n And so their retreat was quite effective and successful\n\n38:31.880 --> 38:33.100\n from the Soviet point of view, right?\n\n38:33.100 --> 38:35.140\n It's not what we're seeing now.\n\n38:35.140 --> 38:37.300\n What year was the retreat?\n\n38:37.300 --> 38:38.840\n I mean, it began,\n\n38:38.840 --> 38:41.900\n so Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985,\n\n38:41.900 --> 38:44.540\n he was a generation younger than the other guys,\n\n38:44.540 --> 38:46.300\n he was a critic of the system,\n\n38:46.300 --> 38:47.140\n he didn't want to abolish it,\n\n38:47.140 --> 38:48.580\n he wanted to reform it,\n\n38:48.580 --> 38:51.360\n he was a true believer in Soviet socialism\n\n38:51.360 --> 38:55.640\n and in the party as a monopolist, right?\n\n38:56.740 --> 38:58.020\n But he was critical of the old guard\n\n38:58.020 --> 39:00.900\n and recognized that the party had to change\n\n39:00.900 --> 39:04.620\n and the whole system had to change to continue to compete.\n\n39:04.620 --> 39:07.420\n And so Afghanistan was one element of this.\n\n39:07.420 --> 39:11.420\n And so he pushed the Afghan elites\n\n39:11.420 --> 39:14.320\n that Moscow was backing to basically say,\n\n39:14.320 --> 39:16.340\n listen, we're gonna share power.\n\n39:16.340 --> 39:19.660\n And so a figure named Najibullah,\n\n39:19.660 --> 39:23.260\n who was a Soviet trained intelligence specialist\n\n39:23.260 --> 39:26.420\n sitting in Kabul agreed.\n\n39:26.420 --> 39:28.780\n And he said, we need to have a more kind of\n\n39:28.780 --> 39:33.220\n pluralistic accommodations approach to our enemies\n\n39:33.220 --> 39:36.260\n who are backed by the US mainly,\n\n39:36.260 --> 39:39.180\n sitting in Pakistan, sitting in Iran,\n\n39:39.180 --> 39:40.540\n backed by these Arabs to a degree,\n\n39:40.540 --> 39:42.340\n getting money from Saudi.\n\n39:42.340 --> 39:45.100\n And he said, let's draw some of them into the government\n\n39:45.100 --> 39:48.420\n and basically have a kind of unity government\n\n39:48.420 --> 39:50.820\n that would make some space to the opposition.\n\n39:50.820 --> 39:53.340\n And for the most part, with US backing,\n\n39:53.340 --> 39:56.020\n with Pakistani backing, with Iranian backing\n\n39:56.020 --> 39:58.540\n and with Saudi backing, the opposition said, no,\n\n39:58.540 --> 40:00.700\n we're not going to reconcile,\n\n40:00.700 --> 40:02.700\n we're gonna push you off the cliff.\n\n40:02.700 --> 40:06.660\n And so that story goes on from at least 1987,\n\n40:06.660 --> 40:11.180\n the last Soviet Red Army troops leave early 1989,\n\n40:11.180 --> 40:15.220\n but the Najibullah government holds on for three more years.\n\n40:15.220 --> 40:17.700\n It is the, I mean, they're still getting some help\n\n40:17.700 --> 40:18.740\n from the Soviet Union,\n\n40:18.740 --> 40:21.660\n its enemies are still getting help from the US mainly.\n\n40:21.660 --> 40:26.660\n And it's not till 1992 that they lose.\n\n40:27.180 --> 40:29.540\n And then Mujahideen come to power,\n\n40:29.540 --> 40:33.060\n they immediately, they're deeply fractured.\n\n40:33.060 --> 40:35.900\n And that's where bin Laden is watching all of this unroll.\n\n40:35.900 --> 40:36.740\n That's right.\n\n40:36.740 --> 40:37.860\n And he's part of the mix, but he's also mobile.\n\n40:37.860 --> 40:42.580\n So he at one point goes, is in Sudan.\n\n40:42.580 --> 40:44.060\n He's moving from place to place.\n\n40:44.060 --> 40:45.220\n His people are all over the world.\n\n40:45.220 --> 40:48.180\n In fact, they, I mean, if you think of the,\n\n40:48.180 --> 40:50.180\n once the Mujahideen take power,\n\n40:50.180 --> 40:52.100\n they have difficulties with Arab fighters too.\n\n40:52.100 --> 40:54.180\n And they don't want them coming in and messing\n\n40:54.180 --> 40:57.140\n with Mujahideen regarding this as like,\n\n40:57.140 --> 40:59.340\n this is an Afghan national state that we're gonna build.\n\n40:59.340 --> 41:01.620\n It's gonna be Islamic, it's gonna be an Islamic state,\n\n41:01.620 --> 41:03.740\n but you can't interfere with us.\n\n41:03.740 --> 41:05.660\n And so there are always tensions.\n\n41:05.660 --> 41:07.020\n And so the Arabs are always kind of,\n\n41:07.020 --> 41:09.980\n I would say they were Arab fighters were always interlopers.\n\n41:11.300 --> 41:13.860\n Yes, the Afghans are happy to take their money,\n\n41:13.860 --> 41:17.460\n send patients to their hospitals, take their weapons,\n\n41:17.460 --> 41:20.700\n but they were never gonna let this be like a Saudi\n\n41:20.700 --> 41:22.720\n or Egyptian or whatever project.\n\n41:23.740 --> 41:26.340\n But then many of those fighters went home,\n\n41:26.340 --> 41:29.140\n they went back to Syria, they went back to Egypt.\n\n41:29.140 --> 41:30.580\n Some wanted to go back to the Saudi Arabia,\n\n41:30.580 --> 41:31.620\n but the Saudis were very careful.\n\n41:31.620 --> 41:33.220\n I mean, the Saudis always used Afghanistan\n\n41:33.220 --> 41:34.860\n as a kind of safety valve.\n\n41:34.860 --> 41:37.180\n In fact, they had fundraisers on television,\n\n41:37.180 --> 41:38.420\n they chartered jets.\n\n41:38.420 --> 41:41.340\n They filled them with people to fly to Pakistan,\n\n41:42.420 --> 41:44.340\n get out in the shower and say, go fight.\n\n41:44.340 --> 41:47.380\n And it was one way that the monarchy, the Saudi monarchy,\n\n41:48.980 --> 41:52.660\n very cleverly I think, created a kind of escape valve\n\n41:52.660 --> 41:55.420\n for would be dissidents in Saudi Arabia, right?\n\n41:55.420 --> 41:56.900\n Just send them abroad.\n\n41:56.900 --> 41:59.140\n You wanna fight Jihad, go do that somewhere else.\n\n41:59.140 --> 42:01.260\n Don't bother the kingdom.\n\n42:01.260 --> 42:04.380\n But all this became dicier in the early 90s\n\n42:04.380 --> 42:06.260\n when some of these guys came back home\n\n42:06.260 --> 42:09.140\n and some of the scholars around them said,\n\n42:09.140 --> 42:11.180\n we've defeated the Soviet Union, which is a huge, huge boost.\n\n42:11.180 --> 42:12.780\n And I think part of the dynamic we see today\n\n42:12.780 --> 42:17.340\n is that the Taliban victory is a renewed inspiration\n\n42:17.340 --> 42:20.220\n for people who think, look, we beat the Soviets,\n\n42:20.220 --> 42:21.940\n now we beat the Americans.\n\n42:21.940 --> 42:24.580\n And so already watching the Soviet retreat\n\n42:24.580 --> 42:26.900\n across this bridge, back into Uzbekistan,\n\n42:26.900 --> 42:30.300\n if you see these dramatic images of the tanks moving,\n\n42:30.300 --> 42:32.420\n a lot of people interpreted this as like,\n\n42:32.420 --> 42:34.620\n we are going to change the world\n\n42:34.620 --> 42:36.500\n and now we're training to the Americans.\n\n42:36.500 --> 42:38.220\n And our local national governments\n\n42:38.220 --> 42:39.780\n are backed by the Americans.\n\n42:39.780 --> 42:42.020\n So let's start with those places\n\n42:42.020 --> 42:44.780\n and then let's go strike the belly of the beast,\n\n42:44.780 --> 42:47.300\n which is America, which is New York.\n\n42:47.300 --> 42:48.140\n And going back to Bin Laden,\n\n42:48.140 --> 42:50.100\n your question about what motivates him,\n\n42:50.100 --> 42:52.500\n what motivated him, again,\n\n42:52.500 --> 42:57.340\n he was not a rigorously trained Islamic scholar.\n\n42:57.340 --> 43:00.580\n And that I think, when this comes up in our classes,\n\n43:00.580 --> 43:01.980\n I think especially young people,\n\n43:01.980 --> 43:03.140\n I mean, people who weren't even born on 9 11,\n\n43:03.140 --> 43:05.460\n I mean, they're shocked, they see his appearance,\n\n43:05.460 --> 43:10.460\n they see him pictured in front of a giant bookshelf\n\n43:10.660 --> 43:13.500\n of Arabic books, he's got the Kalashnikov,\n\n43:13.500 --> 43:14.700\n he's got what looks like\n\n43:14.700 --> 43:16.980\n a religious scholars library behind him, right?\n\n43:16.980 --> 43:19.620\n But if you look at his words,\n\n43:19.620 --> 43:21.500\n I mean, one fascinating thing about just our politics\n\n43:21.500 --> 43:22.700\n and just one thing that kind of sums all this up,\n\n43:22.700 --> 43:25.180\n I mean, the fact that on 9 11,\n\n43:25.180 --> 43:29.740\n we had to have a few people, a few experts,\n\n43:29.740 --> 43:32.140\n people like Burnett Rubin, who was an Afghanistan expert.\n\n43:32.140 --> 43:33.780\n So that was one way in which I think,\n\n43:33.780 --> 43:35.220\n I'm not faulting him personally,\n\n43:35.220 --> 43:37.500\n but it's just one way in which that relationship\n\n43:37.500 --> 43:40.340\n appeared to be formed, right?\n\n43:40.340 --> 43:42.620\n Of linking Afghanistan to that moment.\n\n43:44.100 --> 43:47.380\n If one looks actually at what Bin Laden was saying and doing,\n\n43:47.380 --> 43:49.340\n people like Richard Clarke were studying this,\n\n43:49.340 --> 43:51.940\n there were Arab leaders, the Arab press was watching this\n\n43:51.940 --> 43:54.020\n because he gave some of his first interviews\n\n43:54.020 --> 43:57.060\n to a few Arab newspaper outlets.\n\n43:57.060 --> 44:00.260\n But speaking of our American kind of monolingualism,\n\n44:00.260 --> 44:01.980\n a lot of what he was saying wasn't known.\n\n44:01.980 --> 44:04.820\n And so I think for several years,\n\n44:04.820 --> 44:07.740\n people weren't reading what Bin Laden said.\n\n44:07.740 --> 44:10.260\n I mean, experts are reading it in Arabic,\n\n44:10.260 --> 44:13.740\n but there was great anxiety around translating his works.\n\n44:13.740 --> 44:15.820\n So we have Mon conf, we have all this other stuff,\n\n44:15.820 --> 44:18.220\n you can buy the collected works of Lenin, Stalin, Mao,\n\n44:18.220 --> 44:20.460\n whatever you want in whatever language you want.\n\n44:20.460 --> 44:22.420\n But Bin Laden was taboo for American publishing.\n\n44:22.420 --> 44:25.540\n So it was only a Verso in the UK\n\n44:25.540 --> 44:29.020\n that published a famous volume called\n\n44:29.020 --> 44:30.940\n Messages to the World,\n\n44:30.940 --> 44:33.820\n which was the first compendium of Bin Laden's writings.\n\n44:33.820 --> 44:35.980\n So he has a Mein Kampf.\n\n44:35.980 --> 44:38.140\n He has a type, does he have a thing?\n\n44:38.140 --> 44:39.220\n I mean, it's a kind of collected works.\n\n44:39.220 --> 44:41.860\n It's a collected works of his, yeah.\n\n44:41.860 --> 44:46.820\n Well, like a blog, like a collection of articles versus.\n\n44:46.820 --> 44:49.300\n Yeah, these are interviews, these are his missives,\n\n44:49.300 --> 44:54.300\n his declarations, his decrees, right?\n\n44:54.300 --> 44:58.060\n But I think just in terms of if we zoom out for a second\n\n44:58.060 --> 45:00.580\n about American policy choices and so on,\n\n45:00.580 --> 45:02.700\n the powers that be didn't trust us\n\n45:02.700 --> 45:04.260\n to know what he was really about.\n\n45:04.260 --> 45:05.100\n I put it that way.\n\n45:05.100 --> 45:06.820\n And I don't say that in a conspiratorial sense.\n\n45:06.820 --> 45:11.100\n I just think that it was a taboo.\n\n45:11.100 --> 45:14.740\n I think people, there was a kind of consensus\n\n45:14.740 --> 45:19.740\n that trust us, we know how to fight Al Qaeda\n\n45:20.180 --> 45:21.340\n and you don't need to know what they're about\n\n45:21.340 --> 45:22.500\n because they're crazy.\n\n45:22.500 --> 45:24.540\n They're fanatics, they're fundamentalists.\n\n45:24.540 --> 45:28.740\n They hate us, remember that language, us versus them.\n\n45:28.740 --> 45:30.740\n But if you read Bin Laden, that's when it gets messy.\n\n45:30.740 --> 45:34.220\n That's where the Bin Laden's argumentation\n\n45:34.220 --> 45:37.140\n is not fundamentally about Islam.\n\n45:37.140 --> 45:39.180\n And if you were sitting here with an Islamic scholar,\n\n45:39.180 --> 45:43.140\n he would say, depending on which Islamic scholar,\n\n45:43.140 --> 45:45.580\n they would tend to go through and dissect\n\n45:45.580 --> 45:48.660\n and negate 99% of the arguments\n\n45:48.660 --> 45:51.100\n that Bin Laden claimed was in Islam, right?\n\n45:51.100 --> 45:53.340\n But what strikes me as an historian who's again,\n\n45:53.340 --> 45:57.020\n looking at this adjacently, if you read Bin Laden,\n\n45:57.020 --> 45:59.940\n I mean, the arguments that he make are,\n\n45:59.940 --> 46:01.420\n first of all, they're sophisticated.\n\n46:01.420 --> 46:06.420\n They reflect a mind that is about geopolitics.\n\n46:07.820 --> 46:09.940\n He uses terms like imperialism.\n\n46:09.940 --> 46:12.220\n He knows something about world history.\n\n46:12.220 --> 46:14.300\n He knows something about geography.\n\n46:14.300 --> 46:16.140\n So imperialism is the enemy for him\n\n46:16.140 --> 46:17.900\n or what's the nature of the enemy?\n\n46:17.900 --> 46:21.620\n It's an amalgam and like a good politician,\n\n46:21.620 --> 46:23.380\n which is what I would call him,\n\n46:23.380 --> 46:27.020\n he is adept at speaking in different ways\n\n46:27.020 --> 46:28.060\n to different audiences.\n\n46:28.060 --> 46:30.620\n So if you look at the context in which he speaks,\n\n46:30.620 --> 46:33.020\n if you look at messages to the world,\n\n46:33.020 --> 46:35.740\n if you look at his writings and you can zoom out now\n\n46:35.740 --> 46:37.660\n and we now have compendia of the writings\n\n46:37.660 --> 46:40.900\n of Al Qaeda more broadly, you can purchase these,\n\n46:42.420 --> 46:45.340\n they're basically primary source collections.\n\n46:45.340 --> 46:47.020\n We now have that for the Taliban.\n\n46:47.020 --> 46:49.500\n I mean, what's fascinating about,\n\n46:49.500 --> 46:52.220\n I think if you'd like this culture,\n\n46:52.220 --> 46:55.740\n acknowledging it's very diverse internally\n\n46:55.740 --> 46:58.860\n is that these people are representatives\n\n46:58.860 --> 47:01.140\n of political movements who seek followers.\n\n47:01.140 --> 47:05.420\n They speak, they often are very,\n\n47:05.420 --> 47:08.460\n I'd say skilled at visual imagery.\n\n47:08.460 --> 47:10.220\n And especially now, I mean, what's fascinating is that,\n\n47:10.220 --> 47:12.900\n I mean, the Taliban used to shoot televisions.\n\n47:12.900 --> 47:17.900\n They used to blow up VCR, videotapes.\n\n47:19.420 --> 47:22.740\n They used to string audio and video cassettes\n\n47:22.740 --> 47:25.860\n from trees and kind of ceremonial hangings, right?\n\n47:25.860 --> 47:30.380\n That we're killing this nefarious, infidel technology\n\n47:30.380 --> 47:32.260\n that is doing the work of Satan.\n\n47:32.260 --> 47:34.540\n And yet today, and plus, I mean,\n\n47:34.540 --> 47:35.740\n one of the keys to the Taliban success\n\n47:35.740 --> 47:38.860\n is that they got really good at using media.\n\n47:38.860 --> 47:42.180\n I mean, brilliant at using the written word,\n\n47:42.180 --> 47:44.100\n the spoken word, music, actually.\n\n47:45.100 --> 47:48.500\n And Hollywood, Hollywood is the gold standard.\n\n47:48.500 --> 47:52.300\n And these guys have studied how to create drama,\n\n47:52.300 --> 47:53.900\n how to speak to modern users.\n\n47:53.900 --> 47:55.020\n I mean, Islamic State did this.\n\n47:55.020 --> 47:57.580\n I mean, the role of media, new media.\n\n47:57.580 --> 48:01.780\n I mean, I follow and I am followed by\n\n48:01.780 --> 48:06.580\n senior Taliban leaders, which is bizarre on Twitter.\n\n48:06.580 --> 48:07.620\n On Twitter?\n\n48:07.620 --> 48:08.900\n I don't know why they care about me.\n\n48:08.900 --> 48:10.500\n I'm nothing.\n\n48:10.500 --> 48:12.820\n They follow you on Twitter.\n\n48:12.820 --> 48:13.660\n I don't know why.\n\n48:13.660 --> 48:14.500\n This is no joke.\n\n48:14.500 --> 48:15.340\n This is no joke.\n\n48:15.340 --> 48:17.260\n So they're part of our modern world\n\n48:17.260 --> 48:18.420\n and it's how they talk and it's how they recruit.\n\n48:18.420 --> 48:20.740\n And this is part of the, this is why they are.\n\n48:20.740 --> 48:22.100\n So Ben Laden, if you read Ben Laden,\n\n48:22.100 --> 48:24.300\n he speaks multiple languages, I would say.\n\n48:24.300 --> 48:27.460\n It's environmentalism.\n\n48:28.420 --> 48:31.500\n The West is bad because we destroyed the planet.\n\n48:31.500 --> 48:34.540\n The West is bad because we abuse women.\n\n48:34.540 --> 48:38.820\n So in class, especially female students\n\n48:38.820 --> 48:40.180\n are very surprised to learn\n\n48:40.180 --> 48:43.580\n and actually say this feminist argument is not,\n\n48:45.500 --> 48:47.420\n we start with, this is a murder.\n\n48:47.420 --> 48:49.140\n This is a person who has taken human life,\n\n48:49.140 --> 48:51.380\n innocent life over and over again.\n\n48:51.380 --> 48:56.020\n And he is aspirationally genocidal,\n\n48:56.020 --> 48:57.620\n but let's try to understand what he's about.\n\n48:57.620 --> 48:59.340\n So we walk through the texts, read them\n\n48:59.340 --> 49:02.740\n and people are shocked to learn that\n\n49:02.740 --> 49:05.820\n it's not just about quotations in the Quran\n\n49:05.820 --> 49:08.300\n strung together in some irrational fashion.\n\n49:08.300 --> 49:10.940\n He knows, I mean, at the core,\n\n49:10.940 --> 49:12.980\n I'd say is the problem of human suffering.\n\n49:12.980 --> 49:15.420\n And he has a geography of that, that is mostly Muslim,\n\n49:15.420 --> 49:17.860\n but he talked about the suffering of Kashmir, right?\n\n49:17.860 --> 49:19.580\n So if you have a student in your class,\n\n49:19.580 --> 49:22.420\n who's from South Asia, who knows about Kashmir,\n\n49:22.420 --> 49:25.940\n he or she will say, that's not entirely inaccurate.\n\n49:26.980 --> 49:29.980\n The Indian state commits atrocities in Kashmir.\n\n49:31.220 --> 49:33.340\n Pakistan is doing that too.\n\n49:33.340 --> 49:35.100\n Palestine is an issue, right?\n\n49:35.100 --> 49:37.940\n So you have in the American university setting,\n\n49:37.940 --> 49:41.500\n people across the spectrum who get that,\n\n49:41.500 --> 49:43.460\n Palestinians have had a raw deal.\n\n49:43.460 --> 49:46.220\n And so it's a, victimhood is central\n\n49:46.220 --> 49:50.140\n and it's Muslim victimhood, which is primary,\n\n49:50.140 --> 49:52.380\n but as a number of scholars have written,\n\n49:52.380 --> 49:55.420\n and I definitely think this is a framework\n\n49:55.420 --> 49:56.260\n for what this is useful.\n\n49:56.260 --> 49:58.500\n I mean, in this kind of vocabulary,\n\n49:58.500 --> 50:00.180\n in this framing, this narrative,\n\n50:01.380 --> 50:03.340\n today, in today's world,\n\n50:03.340 --> 50:06.580\n if we think of today's world being post Cold War,\n\n50:06.580 --> 50:11.100\n 91 to the present, looking at the series of Gulf Wars\n\n50:12.020 --> 50:12.940\n and seeing the visuals of that,\n\n50:12.940 --> 50:14.700\n I think that the American public\n\n50:14.700 --> 50:15.540\n has been shielded from some of this,\n\n50:15.540 --> 50:20.060\n but if you look at just the carnage of the Iraqi army\n\n50:20.940 --> 50:24.180\n that George H.W. Bush produced, right?\n\n50:24.180 --> 50:26.500\n Or you think of the images of the suffering\n\n50:26.500 --> 50:31.180\n of Iraqi children under George H.W. Bush's sanctions,\n\n50:31.180 --> 50:33.420\n US British airstrikes,\n\n50:33.420 --> 50:36.740\n then you have Madeleine Albright answer a question\n\n50:36.740 --> 50:37.580\n on 16 Minutes saying,\n\n50:37.580 --> 50:40.660\n do you think the deaths of half a million Iraqi kids\n\n50:40.660 --> 50:41.820\n is worth it?\n\n50:41.820 --> 50:44.620\n Is that justified to contain Saddam Hussein?\n\n50:44.620 --> 50:47.860\n And she says on camera, yes, it's worth it to me.\n\n50:47.860 --> 50:49.820\n If you put that all together,\n\n50:49.820 --> 50:52.300\n I mean, American kids, and of course the American public,\n\n50:52.300 --> 50:55.900\n they're not always aware of those facts of global history,\n\n50:55.900 --> 50:57.180\n but these guys are,\n\n50:57.180 --> 51:02.180\n and they very capably use these images, use these tropes,\n\n51:02.180 --> 51:03.820\n and use facts.\n\n51:03.820 --> 51:05.780\n I mean, some of these things are not deniable.\n\n51:05.780 --> 51:07.980\n I mean, these estimates about the number\n\n51:07.980 --> 51:10.740\n of Iraqi civilian children dead,\n\n51:10.740 --> 51:12.100\n that came from, I think, the Lancet,\n\n51:12.100 --> 51:13.980\n and it came from, those are estimates,\n\n51:13.980 --> 51:18.420\n but looking at this from the point of view of Amman,\n\n51:18.420 --> 51:22.380\n of Jaffa, of Nairobi,\n\n51:22.380 --> 51:25.100\n you can just think around the planet,\n\n51:25.100 --> 51:26.500\n and if you see yourself as the victim\n\n51:26.500 --> 51:29.700\n of this great imperial power,\n\n51:29.700 --> 51:31.020\n you can see why especially young men\n\n51:31.020 --> 51:36.020\n would be drawn to a road of self sacrifice.\n\n51:37.220 --> 51:41.820\n And the idea is that in killing others,\n\n51:41.820 --> 51:46.820\n you are making them feel how you feel,\n\n51:46.860 --> 51:49.180\n because they won't listen to your arguments reasonably,\n\n51:49.180 --> 51:52.620\n because they won't recognize Palestinian suffering,\n\n51:52.620 --> 51:54.380\n Bosnian suffering, right?\n\n51:54.380 --> 51:55.860\n Chechen suffering.\n\n51:55.860 --> 51:57.420\n You go across the planet, right?\n\n51:57.420 --> 51:59.980\n Because they won't recognize our suffering,\n\n51:59.980 --> 52:01.620\n we're gonna speak to you in the only language\n\n52:01.620 --> 52:04.220\n that you understand, and that's violence.\n\n52:04.220 --> 52:08.220\n And look at the violence of the post 1991 world, right?\n\n52:08.220 --> 52:12.340\n In which American air power really becomes a global,\n\n52:12.340 --> 52:15.600\n you know, kind of fact in the lives of so many people.\n\n52:16.820 --> 52:19.340\n And then the big mistake after 9 11 among many,\n\n52:19.340 --> 52:22.860\n I mean, fundamentally was taking the war on terror\n\n52:22.860 --> 52:25.060\n to some 30 or 40 countries, right?\n\n52:25.060 --> 52:28.180\n So that you have more and more of the globe\n\n52:28.180 --> 52:30.820\n feel like they're under attack, right?\n\n52:30.820 --> 52:33.540\n And the logic is essentially, it's really bin Laden,\n\n52:33.540 --> 52:36.500\n it's not we're going to convert you\n\n52:36.500 --> 52:38.820\n and turn you into Muslims and that's why we're doing this.\n\n52:38.820 --> 52:42.100\n That appears, that claim does appear at times.\n\n52:42.100 --> 52:45.140\n But if you look at any given bin Laden text,\n\n52:45.140 --> 52:47.500\n I mean, there are 40 claims in each text.\n\n52:47.500 --> 52:48.900\n I mean, it's kind of, it's dizzying,\n\n52:48.900 --> 52:51.080\n but he's a modern politician,\n\n52:51.080 --> 52:54.860\n he knows the language of social equality,\n\n52:54.860 --> 52:56.820\n you know, there's a class dimension to it,\n\n52:56.820 --> 52:58.660\n there is an environmental dimension to it,\n\n52:58.660 --> 53:00.740\n there's a gender dimension to it.\n\n53:00.740 --> 53:04.180\n And yes, there are chronic quotes sprinkled in.\n\n53:04.180 --> 53:06.500\n And when he wants to speak that language,\n\n53:06.500 --> 53:09.300\n he knew that, you know, he's not a scholar.\n\n53:09.300 --> 53:13.420\n So he would often get a few recognized scholars to sign on.\n\n53:13.420 --> 53:16.020\n So some of his decorations of Jihad\n\n53:16.020 --> 53:19.000\n had his signature kind of sprinkled in\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:20.500\n with like a dozen other signatures\n\n53:20.500 --> 53:22.780\n from people who are somewhat known\n\n53:22.780 --> 53:24.800\n or at least with titles, right?\n\n53:24.800 --> 53:28.240\n So as a kind of intellectual exercise,\n\n53:28.240 --> 53:29.080\n it's fascinating to see\n\n53:29.080 --> 53:33.120\n that he is throwing everything at the wall in one level.\n\n53:34.080 --> 53:35.760\n That's one way to see that it's a,\n\n53:35.760 --> 53:39.860\n these are kind of testaments toward recruitment\n\n53:39.860 --> 53:43.840\n of people who, yes, they're angry, yes, they're unhappy.\n\n53:43.840 --> 53:44.680\n And this is what, you know,\n\n53:44.680 --> 53:47.160\n I think for a broader public, it's hard to get,\n\n53:47.160 --> 53:51.280\n you're like, well, bin Laden didn't suffer, he wasn't poor.\n\n53:51.280 --> 53:55.120\n Like, yeah, I mean, Lenin, Pol Pot, I mean.\n\n53:55.120 --> 53:57.160\n They're speaking to, they're empathetic\n\n53:57.160 --> 53:58.560\n to the suffering, the landscape,\n\n53:58.560 --> 53:59.860\n the full landscape of suffering.\n\n53:59.860 --> 54:03.400\n It's interesting to think about suffering,\n\n54:03.400 --> 54:06.900\n you know, America, the American public,\n\n54:06.900 --> 54:08.900\n American politicians and leaders,\n\n54:09.880 --> 54:13.080\n when they see what is good and evil,\n\n54:13.080 --> 54:16.560\n they're often not empathetic to the suffering of others.\n\n54:16.560 --> 54:21.560\n And what you're saying is bin Laden perhaps accurately\n\n54:21.600 --> 54:24.860\n could speak to the ignorance of America,\n\n54:24.860 --> 54:28.280\n maybe the Soviet Union, to the suffering of their people.\n\n54:28.280 --> 54:29.120\n That's right.\n\n54:29.120 --> 54:32.680\n And I mean, if you look at the speeches\n\n54:32.680 --> 54:37.200\n and the ideas that are public of Hitler in the 1930s,\n\n54:37.200 --> 54:42.200\n he spoke quite accurately to the injustice\n\n54:42.640 --> 54:46.480\n and maybe the suffering of the German people.\n\n54:46.480 --> 54:49.080\n I mean, charismatic politicians\n\n54:49.080 --> 54:50.840\n are good at telling accurate stories.\n\n54:50.840 --> 54:53.040\n It's not all fabricated,\n\n54:53.040 --> 54:55.640\n but they emphasize certain aspects.\n\n54:55.640 --> 54:58.400\n And then the problem part is the actions\n\n54:58.400 --> 55:00.200\n you should take based on that.\n\n55:01.480 --> 55:03.600\n So the narratives and the stories\n\n55:03.600 --> 55:06.680\n may be grounded in historical accuracy.\n\n55:06.680 --> 55:11.680\n The actions then cross the line, the ethical line.\n\n55:11.800 --> 55:13.600\n I found that too, I mean, it's a,\n\n55:13.600 --> 55:14.760\n again, if you pick up just one of these texts,\n\n55:14.760 --> 55:15.980\n I mean, it's a kaleidoscope.\n\n55:15.980 --> 55:18.480\n So the Hitler analogy is interesting\n\n55:18.480 --> 55:21.200\n because it's Hitler spoke to,\n\n55:21.200 --> 55:23.400\n he could speak to things like inflation, right?\n\n55:23.400 --> 55:24.500\n Which really existed.\n\n55:25.400 --> 55:29.920\n But he also appealed to the irrational emotions of Germans.\n\n55:29.920 --> 55:34.920\n He sought out scapegoats, Jews, Roma, disabled people,\n\n55:36.220 --> 55:38.120\n homosexuals and so on, right?\n\n55:38.120 --> 55:40.120\n That's also there in bin Laden too.\n\n55:40.120 --> 55:44.040\n I mean, the idea of an anti semitism,\n\n55:44.040 --> 55:47.640\n the constant flagging of Zionists and crusaders,\n\n55:47.640 --> 55:50.720\n it's a kind of shotgun approach to a search for followers.\n\n55:50.720 --> 55:53.160\n But I also hasten to add that it's,\n\n55:53.160 --> 55:55.640\n for all of the things that we could take off saying,\n\n55:55.640 --> 55:58.360\n well, yes, Kashmiris have suffered,\n\n55:58.360 --> 56:00.000\n Chechens have suffered and so on.\n\n56:01.280 --> 56:04.320\n Bin Ladenism never became a mass movement.\n\n56:04.320 --> 56:06.660\n I mean, it never really, I think the,\n\n56:08.040 --> 56:09.760\n I mean, this is the encouraging thing, right?\n\n56:09.760 --> 56:11.440\n About ideology.\n\n56:11.440 --> 56:14.840\n I mean, I think the blood on his hands\n\n56:14.840 --> 56:18.080\n always limited his appeal among Muslims and others.\n\n56:19.560 --> 56:21.120\n But Bin Laden did have, I mean, he had a,\n\n56:21.120 --> 56:23.400\n there's a great book by a great scholar\n\n56:23.400 --> 56:26.760\n at UC San Diego, Jeremy Prestholt,\n\n56:26.760 --> 56:29.120\n who read a great book about global icons\n\n56:29.120 --> 56:34.120\n in which he has Bin Laden, he has Bob Marley,\n\n56:35.640 --> 56:40.440\n he has Tupac, you know, he asked why,\n\n56:40.440 --> 56:42.360\n you know, he's doing research in East Africa,\n\n56:42.360 --> 56:46.240\n why did he see young kids wearing Bin Laden shirts?\n\n56:46.240 --> 56:48.080\n They're also wearing like Tupac shirts.\n\n56:48.080 --> 56:50.000\n They're wearing Bob Marley shirts.\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:55.000\n And it's a way of looking at a kind of partial embrace\n\n56:56.760 --> 57:00.100\n of some aspects of the rebelliousness\n\n57:00.100 --> 57:02.540\n of some of these figures, some of the time,\n\n57:02.540 --> 57:05.280\n by some people under certain conditions.\n\n57:05.280 --> 57:06.500\n Well, the terrifying thing to me,\n\n57:06.500 --> 57:08.760\n so yeah, there is a longing in the human heart\n\n57:08.760 --> 57:13.240\n to belong to a group and a charismatic leader somehow,\n\n57:14.120 --> 57:16.120\n especially when you're young,\n\n57:16.120 --> 57:18.840\n just a catalyst for all of that.\n\n57:18.840 --> 57:22.920\n I tend to think that perhaps it's actually hard\n\n57:22.920 --> 57:26.760\n to be Hitler, so a leader so charismatic\n\n57:26.760 --> 57:29.560\n that he can rally a nation to war.\n\n57:29.560 --> 57:32.580\n And Bin Laden, perhaps we're lucky,\n\n57:32.580 --> 57:35.560\n was not sufficiently charismatic.\n\n57:35.560 --> 57:37.740\n I feel like if his writing was better,\n\n57:37.740 --> 57:39.560\n if his speeches were better,\n\n57:39.560 --> 57:41.660\n if his ideas were stronger,\n\n57:42.840 --> 57:46.000\n better, it's like more viral,\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:48.800\n and then there would be more people,\n\n57:48.800 --> 57:52.560\n kind of young people uniting around him.\n\n57:52.560 --> 57:56.200\n So in some sense, it's almost like accidents of history\n\n57:56.200 --> 57:58.240\n of just how much charisma,\n\n57:58.240 --> 58:01.360\n how much charisma a particular evil person has,\n\n58:01.360 --> 58:03.240\n a person like Bin Laden.\n\n58:03.240 --> 58:05.680\n I think it's fair, evil works, I think.\n\n58:05.680 --> 58:07.400\n So you think Bin Laden is evil?\n\n58:07.400 --> 58:08.240\n Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n58:08.240 --> 58:09.940\n I mean, he was a mass murderer.\n\n58:11.120 --> 58:13.720\n I'm just saying that his ideas were,\n\n58:13.720 --> 58:17.680\n they're more complex than we've tended to acknowledge.\n\n58:17.680 --> 58:21.960\n They have a wider potential resonance\n\n58:21.960 --> 58:23.360\n than we would acknowledge.\n\n58:23.360 --> 58:25.600\n I mean, and also, I guess what I'm,\n\n58:25.600 --> 58:27.620\n just one fundamental point is that\n\n58:29.560 --> 58:31.680\n thinking about the complexity of Bin Laden\n\n58:31.680 --> 58:34.580\n is also a way of removing him from Islam.\n\n58:35.560 --> 58:36.800\n He is not an Islamic thinker.\n\n58:36.800 --> 58:39.680\n He is a cosmopolitan thinker\n\n58:39.680 --> 58:43.240\n who plays in all kinds of modern ideologies,\n\n58:43.240 --> 58:45.720\n which have proven to mobilize people in the past, right?\n\n58:45.720 --> 58:50.720\n So antisemitism, populism, environmentalism,\n\n58:51.880 --> 58:56.400\n and the urging to do something about humanity,\n\n58:56.400 --> 58:57.800\n do something about suffering.\n\n58:57.800 --> 58:59.120\n That's why I think the actual,\n\n58:59.120 --> 59:00.320\n you asked about what motivates people\n\n59:00.320 --> 59:01.140\n to do this kind of stuff.\n\n59:01.140 --> 59:04.380\n I think that's why if one goes below the level of leadership,\n\n59:04.380 --> 59:05.720\n and this is being reported,\n\n59:05.720 --> 59:09.240\n if you look at the trial ongoing now in Paris\n\n59:09.240 --> 59:12.860\n of the Bataclan murders, I think,\n\n59:14.080 --> 59:15.600\n the court allowed some discussion\n\n59:15.600 --> 59:17.640\n of the backgrounds of the accused,\n\n59:17.640 --> 59:20.360\n and they come from different backgrounds,\n\n59:20.360 --> 59:22.040\n but if there's any common bond,\n\n59:22.040 --> 59:26.160\n it's kind of that they had some background in petty crime.\n\n59:26.160 --> 59:28.300\n Famously, in the 7.7 bombings in London,\n\n59:29.260 --> 59:32.560\n the Metropolitan Police, UK authorities\n\n59:32.560 --> 59:34.520\n looked at all those guys,\n\n59:34.520 --> 59:36.940\n and what people want is this idea\n\n59:36.940 --> 59:39.100\n that they must be very pious.\n\n59:39.100 --> 59:42.040\n They must be super Islamic to do this kind of stuff.\n\n59:42.040 --> 59:43.560\n They must be fanatical true believers,\n\n59:43.560 --> 59:45.360\n but what they found with those guys\n\n59:45.360 --> 59:50.020\n was that some were nominally Muslim,\n\n59:50.020 --> 59:51.720\n some went to mosques, some didn't.\n\n59:53.320 --> 59:57.640\n Some were single, young guys with criminal backgrounds.\n\n59:57.640 --> 1:00:01.880\n Some were like, sorry, they were kind of misfits\n\n1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:04.400\n who never succeeded in anything.\n\n1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:06.480\n But others had at least one thing,\n\n1:00:06.480 --> 1:00:10.480\n had a wife and family who he widowed and orphaned.\n\n1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:12.840\n And so there's no, I mean, for policing,\n\n1:00:12.840 --> 1:00:15.160\n I mean, if you're looking at it through that lens,\n\n1:00:15.160 --> 1:00:17.560\n there is no kind of typology\n\n1:00:17.560 --> 1:00:20.120\n that will predict who will become violent.\n\n1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:22.160\n And that's why I think we have to move beyond\n\n1:00:22.160 --> 1:00:25.880\n thinking about religious augmentation narrowly or by itself\n\n1:00:25.880 --> 1:00:27.280\n and think about things like geopolitics,\n\n1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:30.220\n think about how people respond to inequality,\n\n1:00:30.220 --> 1:00:35.220\n the existential threat of climate crisis,\n\n1:00:35.980 --> 1:00:38.180\n of a whole host of matters,\n\n1:00:38.180 --> 1:00:42.080\n and think about this is a mode of political contestation.\n\n1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:43.560\n I mean, it's a violent one, it's one I condemn.\n\n1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:45.200\n It is evil, right?\n\n1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:47.760\n But these are people that are trying to be political.\n\n1:00:47.760 --> 1:00:49.800\n They're trying to change things in some way.\n\n1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:51.460\n It's not narrowly about like,\n\n1:00:51.460 --> 1:00:54.220\n I don't know, impose Sharia law on you.\n\n1:00:54.220 --> 1:00:55.940\n You must wear a veil.\n\n1:00:55.940 --> 1:00:57.220\n You must eat this kind of food.\n\n1:00:57.220 --> 1:00:59.340\n It's not that parochial.\n\n1:00:59.340 --> 1:01:00.980\n But another quick thought\n\n1:01:00.980 --> 1:01:03.380\n about your interesting claim about charisma in this,\n\n1:01:03.380 --> 1:01:06.820\n I think that the one self limiting feature\n\n1:01:06.820 --> 1:01:11.140\n of this subculture is that definitely,\n\n1:01:11.140 --> 1:01:13.940\n I mentioned the enigma of not wanting to be seen\n\n1:01:13.940 --> 1:01:17.420\n and that the kind of invisibility\n\n1:01:17.420 --> 1:01:19.740\n is a productive force of a power,\n\n1:01:20.700 --> 1:01:22.420\n which a colleague of mine\n\n1:01:22.420 --> 1:01:24.860\n who knows ancient history far better than I,\n\n1:01:24.860 --> 1:01:29.420\n said that this is, when she looked at Milo Omar initially,\n\n1:01:29.420 --> 1:01:30.460\n or we talk about Bin Laden,\n\n1:01:30.460 --> 1:01:33.580\n I mean, this kind of studied posture\n\n1:01:33.580 --> 1:01:34.860\n of staying in the shadows\n\n1:01:36.020 --> 1:01:37.980\n is also a source of authority potentially,\n\n1:01:37.980 --> 1:01:41.140\n because it invites the idea,\n\n1:01:41.140 --> 1:01:42.780\n and it's partly dictatorships do as well.\n\n1:01:42.780 --> 1:01:45.780\n I mean, it invites the idea that someone's working,\n\n1:01:45.780 --> 1:01:47.820\n and maybe it's the basis for a lot of QAnon\n\n1:01:47.820 --> 1:01:48.660\n or other conspiracy today,\n\n1:01:48.660 --> 1:01:51.220\n that someone's working behind the scenes\n\n1:01:51.220 --> 1:01:53.020\n and things are gonna go the right way.\n\n1:01:53.020 --> 1:01:54.460\n You can't see it.\n\n1:01:54.460 --> 1:01:57.940\n That's almost preferable because you can kind of feel it.\n\n1:01:57.940 --> 1:02:01.140\n And so not having someone out front\n\n1:02:01.140 --> 1:02:02.740\n can be maybe more effective\n\n1:02:02.740 --> 1:02:04.900\n than having someone out in front constantly.\n\n1:02:04.900 --> 1:02:05.740\n Then the whole...\n\n1:02:05.740 --> 1:02:06.580\n Maybe, maybe.\n\n1:02:06.580 --> 1:02:07.420\n And then the whole Bin Laden,\n\n1:02:07.420 --> 1:02:09.300\n you know, Milo Omar thing, like you can't see me,\n\n1:02:09.300 --> 1:02:11.380\n or if you look at Bin Laden's photographs\n\n1:02:11.380 --> 1:02:14.980\n and his video stuff, I mean, he's coy.\n\n1:02:16.340 --> 1:02:18.860\n Some observers have noted that he's kind of effeminate.\n\n1:02:18.860 --> 1:02:21.140\n He doesn't strike this kind of masculine,\n\n1:02:21.140 --> 1:02:24.260\n he's not a Mussolini, he's not a Hitler,\n\n1:02:24.260 --> 1:02:26.780\n macho, upstanding, thumping my chest.\n\n1:02:26.780 --> 1:02:29.380\n He's not doing the theatrical chin, you know?\n\n1:02:29.380 --> 1:02:32.780\n The theater people tell us he's so aggressive, you know?\n\n1:02:32.780 --> 1:02:33.820\n Oh, a chin?\n\n1:02:33.820 --> 1:02:35.540\n What, bringing your chin up?\n\n1:02:35.540 --> 1:02:38.220\n I saw a great BBC theater person.\n\n1:02:38.220 --> 1:02:39.420\n It was kind of a...\n\n1:02:39.420 --> 1:02:42.300\n It was a makeover show about how to become a better...\n\n1:02:42.300 --> 1:02:43.140\n A dictator?\n\n1:02:43.140 --> 1:02:43.980\n Oh, no.\n\n1:02:43.980 --> 1:02:47.740\n Just a powerful, yeah, leader, authoritarian figure.\n\n1:02:47.740 --> 1:02:49.860\n No, just how to get ahead in life.\n\n1:02:49.860 --> 1:02:50.700\n And then...\n\n1:02:50.700 --> 1:02:51.540\n Oh, okay, cool.\n\n1:02:51.540 --> 1:02:53.700\n And just about acting, how you can act differently, right?\n\n1:02:53.700 --> 1:02:55.340\n So it was a BBC thing.\n\n1:02:56.220 --> 1:02:59.660\n And this woman claimed that, you know,\n\n1:02:59.660 --> 1:03:01.620\n sticking your chin out, like a wrestler does, right,\n\n1:03:01.620 --> 1:03:03.020\n is the most, like, male to male.\n\n1:03:03.020 --> 1:03:05.820\n I love this kind of hilarious analysis\n\n1:03:05.820 --> 1:03:08.380\n that people have about power.\n\n1:03:08.380 --> 1:03:09.660\n But watch the chin, watch the chin.\n\n1:03:09.660 --> 1:03:11.740\n It's the same as analyzing, like,\n\n1:03:11.740 --> 1:03:16.300\n in wrestling styles that win or fighting or so on.\n\n1:03:16.300 --> 1:03:17.420\n There's so many ways to do it.\n\n1:03:17.420 --> 1:03:19.420\n Well, the chin, I mean, the chin is a...\n\n1:03:19.420 --> 1:03:21.620\n Could be interesting verbal gesture.\n\n1:03:21.620 --> 1:03:25.900\n And I've watched enough Mussolini footage from my classes\n\n1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:27.500\n to try to pick the right moment.\n\n1:03:27.500 --> 1:03:28.380\n And the chin is...\n\n1:03:28.380 --> 1:03:29.900\n Mussolini is all about the chin, so...\n\n1:03:29.900 --> 1:03:33.540\n And I have watched human beings and human nature enough\n\n1:03:33.540 --> 1:03:36.220\n to know that there's more to a man,\n\n1:03:36.220 --> 1:03:38.060\n a powerful man, than a chin.\n\n1:03:38.060 --> 1:03:38.900\n Yeah, no, no, no.\n\n1:03:38.900 --> 1:03:40.340\n I'm saying it's an act of aggression.\n\n1:03:40.340 --> 1:03:41.180\n I'm not saying it's...\n\n1:03:41.180 --> 1:03:43.820\n It's one of the many tools in the toolkit.\n\n1:03:43.820 --> 1:03:44.660\n Yeah, yeah, sure.\n\n1:03:44.660 --> 1:03:45.500\n So she definitely...\n\n1:03:45.500 --> 1:03:47.540\n It's not all about the chin, but it's a...\n\n1:03:47.540 --> 1:03:49.500\n But that's what I'm trying to tell you about Ben Laden.\n\n1:03:49.500 --> 1:03:52.500\n I don't think he was deliberate enough\n\n1:03:52.500 --> 1:03:55.060\n with the way he presents himself.\n\n1:03:55.060 --> 1:03:55.900\n What I'm saying about Ben Laden\n\n1:03:55.900 --> 1:03:58.060\n that makes him different from these other characters is that\n\n1:03:58.060 --> 1:04:01.460\n because he played at being the scholar,\n\n1:04:01.460 --> 1:04:05.580\n he played at being a figure of modesty and humility.\n\n1:04:05.580 --> 1:04:07.940\n And that meant that he was often...\n\n1:04:07.940 --> 1:04:09.140\n Again, if you watch his visuals,\n\n1:04:09.140 --> 1:04:11.780\n I mean, yes, there's one video of him firing a gun,\n\n1:04:11.780 --> 1:04:14.220\n but if you watch how he moved,\n\n1:04:14.220 --> 1:04:16.220\n how he wouldn't look at people directly,\n\n1:04:16.220 --> 1:04:17.900\n how his face was almost...\n\n1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:20.260\n I mean, he appears to be incredibly shy.\n\n1:04:20.260 --> 1:04:22.180\n He's not spoken.\n\n1:04:22.180 --> 1:04:23.860\n His voice was low.\n\n1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:25.820\n He attempted to be poetic, right?\n\n1:04:25.820 --> 1:04:28.500\n So it wasn't a warrior kind of image\n\n1:04:28.500 --> 1:04:30.900\n that he tried to project of like a tough guy.\n\n1:04:30.900 --> 1:04:34.620\n It was, I'm demure, I'm humble.\n\n1:04:34.620 --> 1:04:37.140\n I'm offering you this message.\n\n1:04:37.140 --> 1:04:41.580\n And the appeal that he was going for was to see...\n\n1:04:43.660 --> 1:04:45.620\n To project himself as a scholar,\n\n1:04:45.620 --> 1:04:48.340\n his knowledge and humility, the whole package,\n\n1:04:48.340 --> 1:04:52.020\n carried with it an authenticity and a valor\n\n1:04:52.020 --> 1:04:54.900\n that would animate, inspire people\n\n1:04:54.900 --> 1:04:56.180\n to commit acts of violence, right?\n\n1:04:56.180 --> 1:04:59.660\n So there's a different kind of logic of like go and kill.\n\n1:04:59.660 --> 1:05:03.660\n So he presented himself in contrast\n\n1:05:03.660 --> 1:05:08.660\n to the imperialist kind of macho power, superpowers.\n\n1:05:09.780 --> 1:05:12.980\n So that's just yet another way of...\n\n1:05:12.980 --> 1:05:14.820\n And you have to have facial hair or hair\n\n1:05:14.820 --> 1:05:16.180\n of different kinds that's recognized.\n\n1:05:16.180 --> 1:05:18.140\n We had a very recognizable look too,\n\n1:05:18.140 --> 1:05:20.020\n or at least later in life.\n\n1:05:20.020 --> 1:05:20.860\n So...\n\n1:05:20.860 --> 1:05:22.860\n Yeah, no, he tried to look the part.\n\n1:05:22.860 --> 1:05:23.980\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:05:23.980 --> 1:05:25.900\n But I'm saying we're fortunate\n\n1:05:25.900 --> 1:05:29.060\n that whatever calculation that he was making,\n\n1:05:29.060 --> 1:05:33.660\n he was not more effective.\n\n1:05:33.660 --> 1:05:38.220\n I mean, the world is full of terrorist organizations\n\n1:05:38.220 --> 1:05:42.700\n and we're fortunate to the degree any one of them\n\n1:05:42.700 --> 1:05:45.580\n does not have an incredibly charismatic leader\n\n1:05:45.580 --> 1:05:49.380\n that attains the kind of power that's very difficult\n\n1:05:49.380 --> 1:05:52.500\n to manage at the geopolitical level.\n\n1:05:52.500 --> 1:05:55.260\n Yeah, and we credit the publics,\n\n1:05:55.260 --> 1:05:57.140\n who don't buy into that, right?\n\n1:05:57.140 --> 1:05:57.980\n Who see through this.\n\n1:05:57.980 --> 1:06:00.140\n We credit the critics, you know?\n\n1:06:01.300 --> 1:06:03.900\n Early on, Kermadev 9.11 itself,\n\n1:06:05.340 --> 1:06:08.900\n one of the problems was that US government officials\n\n1:06:08.900 --> 1:06:12.140\n kept kind of leaning on Muslims to condemn this\n\n1:06:12.140 --> 1:06:16.260\n as if all Muslims shared some collective responsibility\n\n1:06:16.260 --> 1:06:17.780\n or culpability.\n\n1:06:17.780 --> 1:06:19.020\n And in fact,\n\n1:06:20.860 --> 1:06:23.060\n dozens of scholars and organizations,\n\n1:06:23.060 --> 1:06:25.100\n hundreds condemned this,\n\n1:06:25.100 --> 1:06:27.140\n but their condemnations never quite made it out.\n\n1:06:27.140 --> 1:06:29.900\n But it created a tension where, you know,\n\n1:06:29.900 --> 1:06:32.420\n if you wore a veil, you must've been one of them\n\n1:06:32.420 --> 1:06:33.980\n and you must be on Team Bin Laden.\n\n1:06:33.980 --> 1:06:35.620\n And so a lot of the, you know,\n\n1:06:35.620 --> 1:06:38.420\n I think a lot of the popular violence and discrimination\n\n1:06:38.420 --> 1:06:40.740\n and profiling came out of that urge\n\n1:06:40.740 --> 1:06:44.140\n to see a oneness, which, you know,\n\n1:06:44.140 --> 1:06:45.420\n Bin Laden projected, right?\n\n1:06:45.420 --> 1:06:47.580\n He wanted to say, we are one community.\n\n1:06:47.580 --> 1:06:50.660\n You know, if you are a Muslim, you must be with me, right?\n\n1:06:50.660 --> 1:06:53.980\n But I think that's where the diversity\n\n1:06:53.980 --> 1:06:55.620\n of Muslim communities became important\n\n1:06:55.620 --> 1:06:57.420\n because outside of small pockets,\n\n1:06:57.420 --> 1:07:00.060\n I mean, they didn't accept his leadership, right?\n\n1:07:00.060 --> 1:07:01.500\n People wore T shirts in some countries.\n\n1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:02.420\n I mean, non Muslims wore T shirts\n\n1:07:02.420 --> 1:07:03.980\n because he was like, he stuck it to the Americans.\n\n1:07:03.980 --> 1:07:07.180\n So in Latin America, people are like,\n\n1:07:07.180 --> 1:07:09.620\n yeah, that was sad, but, you know, finally,\n\n1:07:09.620 --> 1:07:10.980\n I mean, there was a kind of schadenfreude\n\n1:07:10.980 --> 1:07:11.820\n in that moment internationally.\n\n1:07:11.820 --> 1:07:13.820\n It's like Che Guevara or somebody like that.\n\n1:07:13.820 --> 1:07:16.140\n Yeah, Che's the other character in Prasad's book.\n\n1:07:16.140 --> 1:07:17.740\n Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right.\n\n1:07:17.740 --> 1:07:18.700\n It's just a symbol.\n\n1:07:18.700 --> 1:07:20.980\n It's not exactly what he believed\n\n1:07:20.980 --> 1:07:23.260\n or the cruelty of actions he took.\n\n1:07:23.260 --> 1:07:24.980\n It's more like he stood for an idea\n\n1:07:24.980 --> 1:07:28.100\n of revolution versus authority.\n\n1:07:28.100 --> 1:07:29.020\n That's right.\n\n1:07:29.020 --> 1:07:32.780\n And that's a great way to understand Bin Ladenism\n\n1:07:32.780 --> 1:07:33.620\n and the whole phenomenon,\n\n1:07:33.620 --> 1:07:35.420\n but I think looking at the big picture,\n\n1:07:35.420 --> 1:07:40.180\n it's also, you wonder, will that ever end, right?\n\n1:07:40.180 --> 1:07:42.180\n I mean, is that, I mean, that's the risk\n\n1:07:42.180 --> 1:07:45.140\n of being a kind of hyper power like the U.S.\n\n1:07:45.140 --> 1:07:49.940\n where you, in assisting on a kind of unipolar world\n\n1:07:49.940 --> 1:07:53.620\n in 2001, 2002, 2003, I think that created\n\n1:07:55.260 --> 1:07:57.860\n an almost irresistible target, you know,\n\n1:07:57.860 --> 1:08:00.700\n wherever the U.S. wanted to exert itself militarily.\n\n1:08:00.700 --> 1:08:03.980\n Before we go to the history of Afghanistan,\n\n1:08:03.980 --> 1:08:05.980\n the people, and I just want to talk to you\n\n1:08:05.980 --> 1:08:10.580\n about just some fascinating aspect of the culture.\n\n1:08:10.580 --> 1:08:12.140\n Let's go to the end.\n\n1:08:13.060 --> 1:08:17.060\n Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.\n\n1:08:18.100 --> 1:08:21.540\n What are your thoughts on how that was executed?\n\n1:08:21.540 --> 1:08:24.460\n How could it have been done better?\n\n1:08:24.460 --> 1:08:26.020\n Yeah, an important question.\n\n1:08:26.020 --> 1:08:29.020\n I mean, I would preface all this by saying,\n\n1:08:29.020 --> 1:08:31.860\n you know, as I noted, I think the war was a mistake.\n\n1:08:31.860 --> 1:08:36.540\n I had hoped the war would end sooner.\n\n1:08:36.540 --> 1:08:39.900\n I think there were different exit routes all along the way.\n\n1:08:39.900 --> 1:08:43.420\n Again, I think there were lots of policy choices\n\n1:08:43.420 --> 1:08:45.940\n in September and October when the war began.\n\n1:08:46.980 --> 1:08:50.540\n There were choices in December 2001.\n\n1:08:50.540 --> 1:08:54.060\n So we could look at almost every six month stopping point\n\n1:08:54.060 --> 1:08:57.580\n and say, we could have done differently.\n\n1:08:57.580 --> 1:09:00.700\n As it turns out though, I mean, the way it played out,\n\n1:09:00.700 --> 1:09:02.380\n you know, it's been catastrophic.\n\n1:09:02.380 --> 1:09:06.580\n And I think the Biden administration\n\n1:09:08.300 --> 1:09:10.180\n has remained unaccountable for the scale\n\n1:09:10.180 --> 1:09:14.340\n of the strategic and humanitarian and ethical failure\n\n1:09:14.340 --> 1:09:15.980\n that they're responsible for.\n\n1:09:15.980 --> 1:09:19.300\n Well, okay, let's lay out the full,\n\n1:09:19.300 --> 1:09:24.060\n there's George W. Bush, there's Barack Obama,\n\n1:09:24.060 --> 1:09:27.820\n there's Donald Trump, there's Biden.\n\n1:09:27.820 --> 1:09:32.820\n So they're all driving this van and there's these exits\n\n1:09:32.820 --> 1:09:34.500\n and they keep not taking the exits\n\n1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:36.500\n and they're running out of gas.\n\n1:09:36.500 --> 1:09:38.980\n I do this all the time thinking, where am I gonna pull off?\n\n1:09:38.980 --> 1:09:41.220\n I'll go till it's empty.\n\n1:09:41.220 --> 1:09:43.860\n How could it have been done better?\n\n1:09:43.860 --> 1:09:48.740\n And what exactly, how much suffering\n\n1:09:48.740 --> 1:09:52.380\n have all the decisions along the way caused?\n\n1:09:52.380 --> 1:09:54.220\n What are the longterm consequences?\n\n1:09:54.220 --> 1:09:56.360\n What are the biggest things that concern you\n\n1:09:56.360 --> 1:10:00.620\n about the decisions we've made in both invading Afghanistan\n\n1:10:00.620 --> 1:10:03.380\n and staying in Afghanistan as long as we have?\n\n1:10:03.380 --> 1:10:05.960\n I mean, if we start at the end, as you proposed,\n\n1:10:07.820 --> 1:10:09.580\n you know, the horrific scenes of the airport,\n\n1:10:09.580 --> 1:10:11.660\n you know, that was just one dimension.\n\n1:10:12.980 --> 1:10:14.420\n I think in the weeks to come,\n\n1:10:15.860 --> 1:10:18.060\n I mean, we're gonna see Afghanistan implode.\n\n1:10:19.540 --> 1:10:22.100\n There are lots of signs that malnutrition,\n\n1:10:22.100 --> 1:10:26.980\n hunger, starvation are going to claim tens of thousands,\n\n1:10:26.980 --> 1:10:29.520\n maybe hundreds of thousands of lives this winter.\n\n1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:33.100\n And I think there is really nothing,\n\n1:10:33.100 --> 1:10:38.100\n there's no framework in place to forestall that.\n\n1:10:38.940 --> 1:10:42.900\n What is the government, what is currently the system there?\n\n1:10:42.900 --> 1:10:44.740\n What's the role of the Taliban?\n\n1:10:44.740 --> 1:10:46.620\n So there could be tens of thousands,\n\n1:10:46.620 --> 1:10:48.420\n hundreds of thousands that starve,\n\n1:10:48.420 --> 1:10:53.420\n either just almost to famine or starve to death.\n\n1:10:54.380 --> 1:10:58.100\n So this is economic implosion, this is political implosion.\n\n1:10:58.100 --> 1:11:01.540\n What's the system there like\n\n1:11:01.540 --> 1:11:05.000\n and what could be the one, you know, some inkling of hope?\n\n1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:05.840\n Right, right.\n\n1:11:06.780 --> 1:11:09.380\n The Taliban sit in control, that's unique.\n\n1:11:09.380 --> 1:11:14.380\n When they were in power in the 1990s from 1996, 2001,\n\n1:11:14.380 --> 1:11:18.860\n they controlled some 85 to 90% of the country.\n\n1:11:18.860 --> 1:11:22.380\n Now they own it all, but they have no budget.\n\n1:11:22.380 --> 1:11:27.380\n The Afghan banking system is frozen.\n\n1:11:28.780 --> 1:11:30.940\n So the financial system is a mess.\n\n1:11:30.940 --> 1:11:32.340\n And it's frozen by the U.S.\n\n1:11:32.340 --> 1:11:34.500\n because the U.S. is trying to use that lever\n\n1:11:34.500 --> 1:11:36.940\n to exert pressure on the Taliban.\n\n1:11:36.940 --> 1:11:40.540\n And so the ethical quandaries are of course legion, right?\n\n1:11:40.540 --> 1:11:44.020\n Do you release that money to allow the Taliban\n\n1:11:44.020 --> 1:11:46.740\n to shore up their rule, right?\n\n1:11:46.740 --> 1:11:48.900\n The Biden administration has said no,\n\n1:11:48.900 --> 1:11:51.380\n but the banks aren't working.\n\n1:11:52.300 --> 1:11:56.660\n If you're in California, you wanna send $100 to your cousin\n\n1:11:56.660 --> 1:11:59.980\n so she can buy bread, you can't do that now.\n\n1:11:59.980 --> 1:12:01.360\n It's almost impossible.\n\n1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:02.600\n There are some informal networks,\n\n1:12:02.600 --> 1:12:06.140\n they're removing some stuff, but there are bread lines.\n\n1:12:06.140 --> 1:12:09.300\n The Taliban government is incapable,\n\n1:12:09.300 --> 1:12:10.720\n fundamentally just of ruling.\n\n1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:13.620\n I mean, they can discipline people on the street,\n\n1:12:13.620 --> 1:12:15.660\n they can force people into the mosque,\n\n1:12:15.660 --> 1:12:18.780\n they can shoot people, they can beat protesters,\n\n1:12:18.780 --> 1:12:20.740\n they can put out a newspaper,\n\n1:12:20.740 --> 1:12:23.860\n they can have, they're great at diplomacy it turns out,\n\n1:12:23.860 --> 1:12:24.860\n they can't rule this country.\n\n1:12:24.860 --> 1:12:27.800\n So essentially the hospitals\n\n1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:31.640\n and the kind of healthcare infrastructure\n\n1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:36.640\n is being managed by NGOs that are international.\n\n1:12:38.460 --> 1:12:41.180\n But most people had to leave\n\n1:12:41.180 --> 1:12:44.740\n and the Taliban have impeded some of that work.\n\n1:12:44.740 --> 1:12:47.980\n They've told adult women essentially to stay home, right?\n\n1:12:47.980 --> 1:12:51.740\n So a big part of the workforce isn't there.\n\n1:12:51.740 --> 1:12:56.740\n So the supply chain is kind of crawling to a halt.\n\n1:12:57.200 --> 1:13:00.260\n Trade with Pakistan and its neighbors,\n\n1:13:00.260 --> 1:13:02.600\n I mean, it's kind of a transit trade economy.\n\n1:13:03.660 --> 1:13:05.540\n It exports fruits.\n\n1:13:05.540 --> 1:13:07.460\n Pakistan has been closing the border\n\n1:13:07.460 --> 1:13:09.060\n because they're anxious about refugees.\n\n1:13:09.060 --> 1:13:12.020\n They want to exert pressure on the international community\n\n1:13:12.020 --> 1:13:13.660\n to recognize the Taliban\n\n1:13:13.660 --> 1:13:17.460\n because the Pakistan want the Taliban to succeed in power\n\n1:13:17.460 --> 1:13:20.420\n because they see that in Pakistan's national interest,\n\n1:13:20.420 --> 1:13:24.020\n especially through the lens of its rivalry with India.\n\n1:13:24.020 --> 1:13:27.380\n So the Pakistani security institutions\n\n1:13:27.380 --> 1:13:29.260\n are playing a double game.\n\n1:13:29.260 --> 1:13:31.460\n Essentially Afghan people are being held hostage.\n\n1:13:31.460 --> 1:13:34.280\n And so the Taliban are also saying,\n\n1:13:34.280 --> 1:13:36.280\n if you don't recognize us,\n\n1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:39.120\n you're gonna let tens of millions of Afghans starve.\n\n1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:41.140\n So to which degree is Taliban,\n\n1:13:41.140 --> 1:13:44.100\n like who are the Taliban?\n\n1:13:44.100 --> 1:13:45.700\n What do they stand for?\n\n1:13:45.700 --> 1:13:47.360\n What do they want?\n\n1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:49.860\n Obviously year by year, this changes.\n\n1:13:49.860 --> 1:13:53.600\n So what is the nature of this organization?\n\n1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:57.820\n Can they be a legitimate, peaceful, kind, respectful\n\n1:13:58.900 --> 1:14:02.320\n government sort of holder of power\n\n1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:06.940\n or are they fundamentally not capable of doing so?\n\n1:14:06.940 --> 1:14:08.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:08.140 --> 1:14:09.900\n I mean, the briefest answer would be\n\n1:14:09.900 --> 1:14:14.900\n that they are a clerical slash military organization.\n\n1:14:17.300 --> 1:14:22.300\n They have, this is kind of a imperfect metaphor,\n\n1:14:23.620 --> 1:14:28.180\n but years ago, a German scholar used the term caravan\n\n1:14:28.180 --> 1:14:29.260\n to describe them.\n\n1:14:29.260 --> 1:14:31.100\n And that has some attractive elements\n\n1:14:31.100 --> 1:14:35.100\n because different people have joined the Taliban\n\n1:14:35.100 --> 1:14:37.500\n for different purposes at different times,\n\n1:14:37.500 --> 1:14:40.100\n but today, and people tell us,\n\n1:14:40.100 --> 1:14:42.180\n scholars who know more about the women than I have said,\n\n1:14:42.180 --> 1:14:45.220\n listen, the Taliban is this kind of hodgepodge\n\n1:14:45.220 --> 1:14:48.300\n of different actors and people and competing interests.\n\n1:14:48.300 --> 1:14:51.140\n And I think, so we have a lot of scholars who said,\n\n1:14:51.140 --> 1:14:54.060\n listen, it's polycentric.\n\n1:14:54.060 --> 1:14:57.300\n It's got people in this city and that city and so on.\n\n1:14:57.300 --> 1:15:00.020\n I think actually, I was always very skeptical.\n\n1:15:00.020 --> 1:15:00.940\n How do they know this?\n\n1:15:00.940 --> 1:15:03.580\n I mean, this is an organization that doesn't want you\n\n1:15:03.580 --> 1:15:06.820\n to know where that money comes from and so on.\n\n1:15:06.820 --> 1:15:09.700\n But I would say now that we have a clear picture\n\n1:15:09.700 --> 1:15:11.300\n of what has happened,\n\n1:15:11.300 --> 1:15:15.220\n I'd say they are a astoundingly well organized\n\n1:15:15.220 --> 1:15:20.220\n clerical military organization that has a very cohesive\n\n1:15:22.300 --> 1:15:26.220\n and enduring ideology, which is quite idiosyncratic.\n\n1:15:26.220 --> 1:15:28.180\n If we zoom out and continue the conversation\n\n1:15:28.180 --> 1:15:30.600\n we're having about Islam and how we think about radicalism\n\n1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:32.780\n and who's drawn to what,\n\n1:15:34.620 --> 1:15:38.540\n people throw different terms around to describe the Taliban.\n\n1:15:38.540 --> 1:15:43.060\n Some use a term that links it to a kind of school of thought\n\n1:15:43.060 --> 1:15:45.900\n born in the 19th century in India, the Doabandi school.\n\n1:15:47.400 --> 1:15:49.260\n But if you look at their teachings,\n\n1:15:49.260 --> 1:15:51.540\n it's very clear now I think that these labels,\n\n1:15:51.540 --> 1:15:54.140\n it's like saying, you're an MIT guy.\n\n1:15:54.140 --> 1:15:54.980\n Well, what does that mean?\n\n1:15:54.980 --> 1:15:59.340\n I mean, MIT is home to dozens of different potentially\n\n1:15:59.340 --> 1:16:02.340\n kinds of intellectual orientations, right?\n\n1:16:02.340 --> 1:16:03.860\n I mean, attaching the name of the school\n\n1:16:03.860 --> 1:16:07.420\n doesn't quite capture, I mean, university.\n\n1:16:07.420 --> 1:16:08.260\n It's complicated.\n\n1:16:08.260 --> 1:16:09.500\n I mean, actually MIT is interesting\n\n1:16:09.500 --> 1:16:11.340\n because I would say MIT is different\n\n1:16:11.340 --> 1:16:13.000\n than Stanford, for example.\n\n1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:16.500\n I think MIT has a more kind of narrow.\n\n1:16:16.500 --> 1:16:18.020\n Yeah, I hear you.\n\n1:16:18.020 --> 1:16:19.740\n Bad analogy on my part, maybe.\n\n1:16:19.740 --> 1:16:21.740\n Well, no, it's interesting because I would argue\n\n1:16:21.740 --> 1:16:26.740\n that there's some aspect of a brand like Taliban or MIT,\n\n1:16:26.740 --> 1:16:31.740\n no relation, that has a kind of interact,\n\n1:16:33.060 --> 1:16:37.100\n like the brand results in the behavior of the,\n\n1:16:37.100 --> 1:16:39.260\n like enforces a kind of behavior on the people\n\n1:16:39.260 --> 1:16:41.860\n and the people feed the brand and like there's a loop.\n\n1:16:41.860 --> 1:16:43.780\n I think Stanford is a good example\n\n1:16:43.780 --> 1:16:45.140\n of something that's more distributed.\n\n1:16:45.140 --> 1:16:48.220\n There's sufficient amount of diversity\n\n1:16:48.220 --> 1:16:50.020\n in like all kinds of like centers\n\n1:16:50.020 --> 1:16:53.180\n and all that kind of stuff that the brand\n\n1:16:53.180 --> 1:16:55.020\n doesn't become one thing.\n\n1:16:55.020 --> 1:16:57.180\n MIT is so engineering.\n\n1:16:57.180 --> 1:16:59.080\n It's so different than that.\n\n1:16:59.080 --> 1:17:01.580\n Okay, scratch MIT, scratch Stanford too\n\n1:17:01.580 --> 1:17:03.540\n because I think Stanford's more like MIT\n\n1:17:03.540 --> 1:17:07.580\n than you might imagine, but isn't Taliban,\n\n1:17:07.580 --> 1:17:10.640\n isn't it pretty, I don't think there's a diversity.\n\n1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:13.200\n So yeah, sorry, so just to rephrase.\n\n1:17:13.200 --> 1:17:15.100\n So people say, oh, the Deobandi school.\n\n1:17:15.100 --> 1:17:16.340\n I'm like, what is that?\n\n1:17:16.340 --> 1:17:20.460\n I mean, but the Taliban are, they're an ethnic movement.\n\n1:17:20.460 --> 1:17:25.460\n They represent a vision of Pashtun power, right?\n\n1:17:26.180 --> 1:17:29.980\n Pashtuns are people who are quite internally diverse,\n\n1:17:29.980 --> 1:17:34.940\n who actually speak multiple dialects of Pashto,\n\n1:17:34.940 --> 1:17:39.940\n who reside across the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\n1:17:40.540 --> 1:17:42.820\n There are Pashtuns who live all over the planet, right?\n\n1:17:42.820 --> 1:17:45.140\n There's a community in Moscow, California, everywhere,\n\n1:17:45.140 --> 1:17:48.660\n right, so it's a global diaspora of sorts.\n\n1:17:48.660 --> 1:17:51.140\n Pashtuns have a kind of genealogical imagination\n\n1:17:51.140 --> 1:17:53.600\n so that lots of Pashtuns can tell you\n\n1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:55.180\n the names of their grandparents, great grandparents\n\n1:17:55.180 --> 1:17:56.420\n and so on, and that's kind of a,\n\n1:17:56.420 --> 1:17:58.840\n there's a sense of pride in that.\n\n1:17:58.840 --> 1:18:03.540\n Pashto language is a kind of core element of that identity,\n\n1:18:03.540 --> 1:18:05.300\n but it's not universal.\n\n1:18:05.300 --> 1:18:07.740\n So for example, you can meet people who say,\n\n1:18:07.740 --> 1:18:10.660\n I am Pashtun, but I don't know Pashto.\n\n1:18:10.660 --> 1:18:14.820\n So as you claw away at this idea, it's amorphous.\n\n1:18:14.820 --> 1:18:15.940\n It also means different things,\n\n1:18:15.940 --> 1:18:17.020\n different people at different times.\n\n1:18:17.020 --> 1:18:20.700\n So saying the Taliban are Pashtun\n\n1:18:20.700 --> 1:18:21.700\n requires lots of qualifiers\n\n1:18:21.700 --> 1:18:24.020\n because lots of Pashtuns will say,\n\n1:18:24.020 --> 1:18:26.480\n no, no, I have nothing to the Taliban.\n\n1:18:26.480 --> 1:18:27.480\n I hate those people.\n\n1:18:28.300 --> 1:18:32.680\n So the Taliban tried to mobilize other Pashtuns\n\n1:18:32.680 --> 1:18:34.120\n with limited success,\n\n1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:37.020\n but their core membership is almost exclusively Pashtun.\n\n1:18:37.020 --> 1:18:40.180\n And they say, no, no, we represent Afghans.\n\n1:18:40.180 --> 1:18:42.460\n We represent pious Muslims.\n\n1:18:42.460 --> 1:18:46.020\n And so in recent two, three years,\n\n1:18:46.020 --> 1:18:48.920\n they've gone further to say, no, we have other groups.\n\n1:18:48.920 --> 1:18:52.660\n We have Uzbeks, we have Tajiks, we have Hazaras.\n\n1:18:52.660 --> 1:18:54.640\n And in the North of Afghanistan, in recent years,\n\n1:18:54.640 --> 1:18:57.300\n they did do a bit better at drawing in people\n\n1:18:57.300 --> 1:18:59.800\n who were very disaffected because of the government.\n\n1:18:59.800 --> 1:19:02.580\n And they were able to diversify their ranks somewhat.\n\n1:19:02.580 --> 1:19:06.060\n But if you want to say August 15 and who they've appointed,\n\n1:19:06.060 --> 1:19:07.440\n what language they've used,\n\n1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:09.980\n how they've presented themselves,\n\n1:19:09.980 --> 1:19:14.500\n it's clear that they are Pashtun, they are male,\n\n1:19:14.500 --> 1:19:19.500\n and they are extremely ideologically cohesive\n\n1:19:20.140 --> 1:19:22.820\n and disciplined, I'd say, right?\n\n1:19:22.820 --> 1:19:25.860\n So I think that a lot of the polycentrism, blah, blah,\n\n1:19:25.860 --> 1:19:27.980\n some of that stuff was a way to fight a war.\n\n1:19:28.860 --> 1:19:33.020\n They are fundamentally a guerrilla movement.\n\n1:19:33.020 --> 1:19:37.620\n They see themselves as kind of pious Robin Hoods.\n\n1:19:37.620 --> 1:19:40.340\n The rhetoric is very much about taking from the rich,\n\n1:19:40.340 --> 1:19:43.100\n taking from the privileged, giving to the poor,\n\n1:19:43.100 --> 1:19:47.020\n being on the side of the underdog, fighting against evil.\n\n1:19:47.020 --> 1:19:50.220\n And so, I mean, their bag, if you like, their thing,\n\n1:19:50.220 --> 1:19:53.780\n their central theme, their brand is about public morality.\n\n1:19:53.780 --> 1:19:55.940\n And so their origin story, going back to 1994,\n\n1:19:55.940 --> 1:20:00.940\n is that they interceded, they broke up a gang of criminals\n\n1:20:00.940 --> 1:20:03.300\n who were trying to rape people.\n\n1:20:03.300 --> 1:20:08.140\n And so there's a very interesting emphasis on sexuality\n\n1:20:08.140 --> 1:20:11.540\n and on public morality and really being the core\n\n1:20:11.540 --> 1:20:16.100\n of we're gonna restore order and public morality.\n\n1:20:16.100 --> 1:20:18.020\n And how that translates into governance\n\n1:20:18.020 --> 1:20:19.300\n is something they've never sorted out.\n\n1:20:19.300 --> 1:20:20.860\n I mean, how do you run a banking system\n\n1:20:20.860 --> 1:20:23.660\n if your intellectual priorities are really about\n\n1:20:23.660 --> 1:20:25.380\n the length of a beard?\n\n1:20:25.380 --> 1:20:29.260\n And then their path to power in a kind of abstract sense,\n\n1:20:29.260 --> 1:20:32.100\n I mean, a lot of that was very much driven by,\n\n1:20:33.740 --> 1:20:37.300\n if you like, propagating the promise of martyrdom.\n\n1:20:37.300 --> 1:20:38.820\n And that sounds, I don't mean to say that in a way\n\n1:20:38.820 --> 1:20:40.740\n that, to make it sound ridiculous,\n\n1:20:40.740 --> 1:20:44.380\n to make it sound like it's a moral judgment,\n\n1:20:44.380 --> 1:20:46.980\n it's simply, I think, a fact, it's a fact of their appeal\n\n1:20:46.980 --> 1:20:51.980\n that they promised young men who have known nothing else\n\n1:20:52.420 --> 1:20:56.300\n but studying in certain schools, if at all,\n\n1:20:56.300 --> 1:20:57.220\n but they've known fighting\n\n1:20:57.220 --> 1:20:59.940\n and they've known victimization.\n\n1:20:59.940 --> 1:21:03.180\n And this isn't, I'm not asking for sympathy for them,\n\n1:21:03.180 --> 1:21:05.380\n but I think the reality is that a lot of the,\n\n1:21:05.380 --> 1:21:06.980\n we know about the kind of foot soldiers\n\n1:21:06.980 --> 1:21:10.860\n is that they lost families in bombings,\n\n1:21:11.700 --> 1:21:13.660\n in airstrikes, in night raids.\n\n1:21:15.300 --> 1:21:17.460\n I mean, orphans have always been a stream,\n\n1:21:18.740 --> 1:21:23.180\n living in all male society, not knowing girls,\n\n1:21:23.180 --> 1:21:25.820\n not knowing women, hearing things from outside\n\n1:21:25.820 --> 1:21:27.420\n about places like Kabul.\n\n1:21:27.420 --> 1:21:30.020\n And so there's always been this kind of urban rural\n\n1:21:30.020 --> 1:21:32.100\n dimension, it's not just that,\n\n1:21:32.100 --> 1:21:36.180\n but I think there's a whole imagination\n\n1:21:36.180 --> 1:21:39.740\n that being Taliban captures.\n\n1:21:39.740 --> 1:21:41.780\n And the whole margin of thing is really it's,\n\n1:21:43.300 --> 1:21:45.060\n you know, I think to any religious person,\n\n1:21:45.060 --> 1:21:46.860\n I mean, it's not a bizarre idea.\n\n1:21:46.860 --> 1:21:50.740\n I mean, it animates, I mean, so many global traditions,\n\n1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:52.660\n you know, but I think the,\n\n1:21:52.660 --> 1:21:54.780\n but you try to tell like an army colonel,\n\n1:21:54.780 --> 1:21:56.460\n if you were to have a conversation with,\n\n1:21:56.460 --> 1:21:58.900\n you know, a US Marine about this,\n\n1:21:58.900 --> 1:21:59.740\n I mean, some would get it\n\n1:21:59.740 --> 1:22:01.300\n from their own religious backgrounds,\n\n1:22:01.300 --> 1:22:04.260\n but I think it's an alien idea,\n\n1:22:04.260 --> 1:22:06.300\n but I think it's essential to kind of stretch out\n\n1:22:06.300 --> 1:22:08.580\n my imagination to understand that's attractive.\n\n1:22:08.580 --> 1:22:09.860\n And now one of the dilemmas going forward\n\n1:22:09.860 --> 1:22:14.180\n is that they've got to pivot from martyrdom.\n\n1:22:14.180 --> 1:22:16.700\n And some have been, some have told foreign journalists,\n\n1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:19.140\n I mean, it's good that we're in charge now,\n\n1:22:19.140 --> 1:22:21.740\n we're gonna build a proper state,\n\n1:22:21.740 --> 1:22:23.700\n but it's kind of boring.\n\n1:22:24.540 --> 1:22:26.820\n I wanna keep fighting, maybe I'll do that in Pakistan.\n\n1:22:26.820 --> 1:22:28.980\n Yeah, I mean, it's nice that they are expressing\n\n1:22:28.980 --> 1:22:32.060\n that thought, some are not even honest sufficiently\n\n1:22:32.060 --> 1:22:34.220\n with themselves to express that kind of thought.\n\n1:22:34.220 --> 1:22:36.740\n If you're a fighter,\n\n1:22:38.340 --> 1:22:40.900\n you see that with a bunch of fighters\n\n1:22:40.900 --> 1:22:43.940\n or professional athletes, once they retire,\n\n1:22:43.940 --> 1:22:47.180\n they don't know, it's very, it's boring.\n\n1:22:47.180 --> 1:22:48.020\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:22:48.020 --> 1:22:50.940\n And so like if the spirit of the Taliban,\n\n1:22:51.820 --> 1:22:55.020\n even the best version of the Taliban is to fight,\n\n1:22:55.020 --> 1:23:00.020\n is to be martyrs, is to paint the world as good and evil\n\n1:23:00.300 --> 1:23:02.900\n and you're fighting evil and all that kind of stuff,\n\n1:23:02.900 --> 1:23:04.620\n that's difficult to imagine how they can run\n\n1:23:04.620 --> 1:23:07.540\n an education system, a banking system,\n\n1:23:07.540 --> 1:23:12.020\n respect all kinds of citizens with different backgrounds\n\n1:23:12.020 --> 1:23:16.580\n and religious beliefs and women and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:23:16.580 --> 1:23:18.460\n Yeah, and they've walked into Kabul\n\n1:23:18.460 --> 1:23:22.060\n and other major cities, some of them are young,\n\n1:23:22.060 --> 1:23:22.900\n they didn't know those places,\n\n1:23:22.900 --> 1:23:26.940\n but also the very important obstacle for them\n\n1:23:26.940 --> 1:23:28.900\n is that Afghan society has changed.\n\n1:23:28.900 --> 1:23:31.500\n I mean, it's not what, even for the older guys,\n\n1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:33.300\n it's not what they knew in the 1990s.\n\n1:23:34.260 --> 1:23:37.500\n Some always had some ambivalence about the capital,\n\n1:23:37.500 --> 1:23:38.500\n but now it's totally different.\n\n1:23:38.500 --> 1:23:40.580\n I mean, they've been shocked to see, I think to me,\n\n1:23:40.580 --> 1:23:43.620\n one of the most striking features of the last few weeks\n\n1:23:43.620 --> 1:23:47.100\n has been that women have come out on the streets\n\n1:23:47.100 --> 1:23:50.300\n and have stood in their faces and said,\n\n1:23:50.300 --> 1:23:52.180\n we demand rights, we demand education,\n\n1:23:52.180 --> 1:23:53.820\n we demand employment.\n\n1:23:53.820 --> 1:23:57.900\n And these foot soldiers are paralyzed, they're not sure.\n\n1:23:57.900 --> 1:23:59.780\n They don't know what to do with women, period.\n\n1:23:59.780 --> 1:24:00.620\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:24:00.620 --> 1:24:01.940\n And they don't know what to do with being yelled at\n\n1:24:01.940 --> 1:24:04.260\n and having someone stick their fingers in their faces.\n\n1:24:04.260 --> 1:24:07.700\n I mean, this is not what they've imagined.\n\n1:24:07.700 --> 1:24:10.340\n And so I think, and at this juncture,\n\n1:24:10.340 --> 1:24:12.460\n there are still foreign cameras around.\n\n1:24:12.460 --> 1:24:16.300\n So they have committed acts of violence against women,\n\n1:24:16.300 --> 1:24:18.580\n against journalists, they've beaten people,\n\n1:24:18.580 --> 1:24:19.580\n they've disappeared people.\n\n1:24:19.580 --> 1:24:22.100\n Even with cameras around, even in this tense period.\n\n1:24:22.100 --> 1:24:24.860\n Yeah, but I think that when the cameras retreat\n\n1:24:24.860 --> 1:24:26.340\n and that's not gonna happen,\n\n1:24:26.340 --> 1:24:28.540\n it's gonna get much worse, I think.\n\n1:24:28.540 --> 1:24:31.980\n So the challenge now is can the Taliban rule?\n\n1:24:31.980 --> 1:24:35.100\n And then this is where the diplomacy is so important\n\n1:24:35.100 --> 1:24:38.580\n because the Taliban can't rule in isolation\n\n1:24:38.580 --> 1:24:39.500\n and they know that.\n\n1:24:39.500 --> 1:24:41.740\n And part of the success is due to the fact\n\n1:24:41.740 --> 1:24:45.500\n that they became very good at talking to other people\n\n1:24:45.500 --> 1:24:48.220\n in the last, I mean, it's been building for the last decade,\n\n1:24:48.220 --> 1:24:50.860\n but I'd say the last five years,\n\n1:24:50.860 --> 1:24:52.300\n they always had Pakistan's backing.\n\n1:24:52.300 --> 1:24:55.820\n And so the Taliban are, we noted they're a military force,\n\n1:24:55.820 --> 1:24:57.260\n very effective guerrilla force.\n\n1:24:57.260 --> 1:25:00.860\n They beat NATO, I mean, this is, still hasn't sunk in.\n\n1:25:00.860 --> 1:25:04.300\n I mean, the fact that they, with light arms,\n\n1:25:04.300 --> 1:25:08.620\n using suicide attacks, using mines,\n\n1:25:08.620 --> 1:25:13.340\n improvised explosive devices, machine guns.\n\n1:25:13.340 --> 1:25:17.100\n In some, in recent years, they got sniper rifles\n\n1:25:17.100 --> 1:25:20.380\n and from the summer, they got American equipment\n\n1:25:20.380 --> 1:25:22.340\n on a broad scale, right?\n\n1:25:22.340 --> 1:25:23.420\n They have airplanes, they have a lot\n\n1:25:23.420 --> 1:25:25.460\n that they will be able to use eventually.\n\n1:25:25.460 --> 1:25:30.460\n So, but still, basically it's a story of AK47s,\n\n1:25:30.660 --> 1:25:33.700\n some American small arms and mines.\n\n1:25:33.700 --> 1:25:36.060\n So it's very Ho Chi Minh,\n\n1:25:36.060 --> 1:25:38.140\n very old school guerrilla fighting, right?\n\n1:25:38.140 --> 1:25:40.300\n And they defeated the most powerful military alliance\n\n1:25:40.300 --> 1:25:41.380\n in world history probably.\n\n1:25:41.380 --> 1:25:43.780\n So that has not yet sunk in and what that means\n\n1:25:43.780 --> 1:25:45.940\n for American and global politics.\n\n1:25:47.260 --> 1:25:49.380\n And now they're trying to rule, right?\n\n1:25:49.380 --> 1:25:52.460\n They know they need international support\n\n1:25:52.460 --> 1:25:56.100\n and their most consistent backer has been Pakistan\n\n1:25:56.100 --> 1:25:59.980\n who sees them as an extension of Pakistani power.\n\n1:26:01.180 --> 1:26:02.660\n And this is very important for a Pakistani elite\n\n1:26:02.660 --> 1:26:05.300\n that of course is looking toward India.\n\n1:26:05.300 --> 1:26:08.540\n They wanna have their rear covered, right?\n\n1:26:08.540 --> 1:26:10.700\n They wanna make sure that these Pashtuns\n\n1:26:10.700 --> 1:26:13.060\n don't cause trouble for Pakistan.\n\n1:26:13.060 --> 1:26:15.380\n And they like, I mean, for some of the security forces,\n\n1:26:15.380 --> 1:26:17.900\n they like this vision of the Islamic state\n\n1:26:17.900 --> 1:26:19.540\n that the Taliban are building there\n\n1:26:19.540 --> 1:26:22.060\n because those are not so distant from their views\n\n1:26:22.060 --> 1:26:24.260\n of what Pakistan should be.\n\n1:26:24.260 --> 1:26:27.180\n But the Taliban have been smart enough\n\n1:26:27.180 --> 1:26:30.380\n to kind of diversify their potential international allies.\n\n1:26:30.380 --> 1:26:32.540\n So everyone in the neighborhood\n\n1:26:32.540 --> 1:26:34.820\n has wanted the US to leave, right?\n\n1:26:34.820 --> 1:26:36.540\n If we go back to 2001,\n\n1:26:36.540 --> 1:26:39.140\n there were Iranian and American special forces in the North\n\n1:26:39.140 --> 1:26:41.660\n working together against the Taliban to displace them\n\n1:26:41.660 --> 1:26:46.660\n using Iranian, American, and then Afghan resistance forces\n\n1:26:47.460 --> 1:26:48.820\n against the Taliban.\n\n1:26:48.820 --> 1:26:50.180\n And that was a real moment of rapprochement\n\n1:26:50.180 --> 1:26:52.940\n if we go back to the missed exits.\n\n1:26:54.580 --> 1:26:55.460\n The relationship with Iran\n\n1:26:55.460 --> 1:26:57.220\n could have been different at that moment,\n\n1:26:57.220 --> 1:27:01.260\n but the US under George W. Bush, you know,\n\n1:27:01.260 --> 1:27:03.580\n devised this axis of evil language,\n\n1:27:04.820 --> 1:27:06.300\n put them together with their enemy,\n\n1:27:06.300 --> 1:27:10.180\n Iraq and the North Korea, all that went south.\n\n1:27:10.180 --> 1:27:12.460\n That was the most opportunity.\n\n1:27:12.460 --> 1:27:14.700\n But in recent years, the Taliban and Iran\n\n1:27:14.700 --> 1:27:19.140\n have kind of papered over the differences.\n\n1:27:19.140 --> 1:27:22.580\n They allowed the Taliban to open small offices\n\n1:27:22.580 --> 1:27:24.460\n on Iranian territory,\n\n1:27:24.460 --> 1:27:26.540\n likely shared some resources, some intelligence,\n\n1:27:26.540 --> 1:27:28.500\n some sophisticated weaponry.\n\n1:27:28.500 --> 1:27:30.660\n And then the Taliban went to Moscow.\n\n1:27:30.660 --> 1:27:32.900\n And for the Putin administration,\n\n1:27:32.900 --> 1:27:35.420\n you know, they've long been worried that,\n\n1:27:35.420 --> 1:27:37.700\n you know, they see the Taliban as a kind of,\n\n1:27:37.700 --> 1:27:40.620\n you know, disease that will potentially move North,\n\n1:27:40.620 --> 1:27:43.180\n infect Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan,\n\n1:27:43.180 --> 1:27:44.660\n Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan,\n\n1:27:44.660 --> 1:27:47.980\n and maybe creep into Russia's sphere of influence.\n\n1:27:47.980 --> 1:27:49.860\n Maybe that's why they have, you know,\n\n1:27:51.060 --> 1:27:52.540\n a bunch of troops sitting in Tajikistan.\n\n1:27:52.540 --> 1:27:54.460\n I mean, the one, you know,\n\n1:27:54.460 --> 1:27:56.900\n Ford base that Russia as well has in Central Asia\n\n1:27:56.900 --> 1:27:57.820\n is in Tajikistan.\n\n1:27:58.780 --> 1:28:01.060\n And so the Taliban were always, you know,\n\n1:28:01.060 --> 1:28:03.900\n a worrying point, but also useful because\n\n1:28:03.900 --> 1:28:05.380\n they could say, well, you know,\n\n1:28:06.700 --> 1:28:08.380\n in case the Taliban get out of control,\n\n1:28:08.380 --> 1:28:09.900\n we need to be here.\n\n1:28:09.900 --> 1:28:12.300\n And so Tajikistan said, okay, you know,\n\n1:28:12.300 --> 1:28:14.100\n you're helping secure us.\n\n1:28:14.100 --> 1:28:16.140\n And yes, it impinges upon our sovereignty,\n\n1:28:16.140 --> 1:28:18.100\n but it's okay, you know?\n\n1:28:18.100 --> 1:28:21.380\n So Putin said, you know, let's, you know,\n\n1:28:21.380 --> 1:28:23.540\n give another black eye to the Americans\n\n1:28:23.540 --> 1:28:25.380\n and let's, you know, treat the Taliban\n\n1:28:25.380 --> 1:28:27.460\n as if they're the kind of government in waiting.\n\n1:28:27.460 --> 1:28:30.180\n Let's have them come to Moscow multiple times.\n\n1:28:30.180 --> 1:28:32.580\n This summer, you know, for the last year or two,\n\n1:28:32.580 --> 1:28:34.300\n they've been talking to China, right?\n\n1:28:34.300 --> 1:28:39.300\n So the photographs of senior Taliban figures\n\n1:28:39.340 --> 1:28:40.740\n going from their office in Qatar,\n\n1:28:40.740 --> 1:28:43.460\n which was a major blow to the U.S. back government,\n\n1:28:43.460 --> 1:28:45.380\n the fact that they were able to open up\n\n1:28:45.380 --> 1:28:47.100\n an office in Qatar that at one point\n\n1:28:47.100 --> 1:28:51.340\n began to fly a flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,\n\n1:28:51.340 --> 1:28:54.260\n that basically said, we're a state in the waiting.\n\n1:28:54.260 --> 1:28:57.300\n And as the U.S.-backed Afghan government failed\n\n1:28:57.300 --> 1:29:00.460\n and failed and failed at ruling too, right?\n\n1:29:00.460 --> 1:29:02.500\n As they showed how corrupt they were.\n\n1:29:02.500 --> 1:29:04.660\n And as they really alienated more and more Afghans\n\n1:29:04.660 --> 1:29:07.340\n by committing acts of violence against them,\n\n1:29:07.340 --> 1:29:11.020\n by stealing from them, by, you know,\n\n1:29:11.020 --> 1:29:15.180\n basically creating a kind of kleptocracy, right?\n\n1:29:17.100 --> 1:29:20.700\n The Taliban said, we are pure, we are not corrupt.\n\n1:29:20.700 --> 1:29:22.660\n And look at us, we're winning on the battlefield.\n\n1:29:22.660 --> 1:29:25.260\n And internationally, look, we're talking to China.\n\n1:29:25.260 --> 1:29:27.980\n We're talking to Putin, we're talking to China.\n\n1:29:27.980 --> 1:29:31.220\n We're a legitimate, powerful center of Central Asia.\n\n1:29:31.220 --> 1:29:33.460\n And also kind of, you know, hinting that, you know,\n\n1:29:33.460 --> 1:29:34.500\n oh, we have a website.\n\n1:29:34.500 --> 1:29:36.180\n I mean, the whole digital angle is amazing\n\n1:29:36.180 --> 1:29:39.380\n because they began to, and this is important, actually.\n\n1:29:39.380 --> 1:29:43.380\n They had a website which grew more and more sophisticated.\n\n1:29:43.380 --> 1:29:45.580\n Again, after having, you know, shot televisions\n\n1:29:45.580 --> 1:29:47.580\n and these kind of ceremonial killings\n\n1:29:47.580 --> 1:29:49.900\n of these infidel devices, right?\n\n1:29:49.900 --> 1:29:53.540\n They said, we have a government, we have commissions,\n\n1:29:53.540 --> 1:29:55.420\n we have a complaint line.\n\n1:29:55.420 --> 1:29:57.980\n They lifted all this technocratic language\n\n1:29:57.980 --> 1:30:00.100\n that you would get from any UN document,\n\n1:30:00.100 --> 1:30:01.340\n you know, about good governance\n\n1:30:01.340 --> 1:30:03.340\n and all the kind of, you know, generic language\n\n1:30:03.340 --> 1:30:06.740\n that the NGO world has produced for us, right, in English.\n\n1:30:06.740 --> 1:30:08.620\n They reproduced that in five languages\n\n1:30:08.620 --> 1:30:10.460\n on their Taiwan website.\n\n1:30:10.460 --> 1:30:12.300\n And of course, I'm not saying even believe this,\n\n1:30:12.300 --> 1:30:15.620\n but it was like, you know, just put me in coach.\n\n1:30:15.620 --> 1:30:17.300\n You know, I know the playbook.\n\n1:30:17.300 --> 1:30:18.140\n I know how to run a government.\n\n1:30:18.140 --> 1:30:20.700\n And look, we have an agricultural commission.\n\n1:30:20.700 --> 1:30:24.220\n We have, you know, a taxation system.\n\n1:30:24.220 --> 1:30:26.180\n And again, this idea, and then on the ground,\n\n1:30:26.180 --> 1:30:28.340\n they had their own law courts.\n\n1:30:28.340 --> 1:30:30.380\n And they would creep into a district,\n\n1:30:30.380 --> 1:30:32.900\n assassinate some people, the local authority figures,\n\n1:30:32.900 --> 1:30:36.380\n men of influence, talk to local clerics,\n\n1:30:36.380 --> 1:30:39.740\n either get them on board or kill them and say, you know,\n\n1:30:39.740 --> 1:30:42.220\n this state is corrupt, but we're bringing you justice.\n\n1:30:42.220 --> 1:30:43.300\n This is our calling card.\n\n1:30:43.300 --> 1:30:45.700\n We're bringing public reality and justice.\n\n1:30:45.700 --> 1:30:48.980\n And then to a broader world, they said, you know,\n\n1:30:48.980 --> 1:30:51.740\n yeah, things didn't go perfectly, the whole Al Qaeda thing,\n\n1:30:51.740 --> 1:30:54.660\n you know, you know, wish we could have a do over on that.\n\n1:30:56.060 --> 1:30:58.780\n We're not gonna let anyone hurt you from our territory.\n\n1:30:58.780 --> 1:31:03.220\n We just wanna rule and people like us and look.\n\n1:31:03.220 --> 1:31:05.140\n And so if you look at the neighborhood,\n\n1:31:05.140 --> 1:31:08.340\n Iran, even the Central Asian states after a while,\n\n1:31:08.340 --> 1:31:09.500\n recognizing they could make some money.\n\n1:31:09.500 --> 1:31:11.420\n I mean, one of the, one thing that Uzbekistan likes\n\n1:31:11.420 --> 1:31:13.940\n about the current arrangement, or they're not,\n\n1:31:13.940 --> 1:31:17.460\n they're not hostile to is that they have all these contracts.\n\n1:31:17.460 --> 1:31:21.180\n They can potentially make some money from, you know,\n\n1:31:21.180 --> 1:31:25.020\n the pipeline dream remains alive, running natural gas, oil,\n\n1:31:25.020 --> 1:31:28.020\n to, you know, which is the Indian ocean,\n\n1:31:28.020 --> 1:31:31.380\n to markets, you know, beyond Central Asia.\n\n1:31:31.380 --> 1:31:32.740\n It's sitting on a couple of trillion dollars,\n\n1:31:32.740 --> 1:31:34.100\n probably in mineral resources\n\n1:31:34.100 --> 1:31:36.500\n that China would love to have, of course.\n\n1:31:36.500 --> 1:31:38.460\n And so people are looking at Afghanistan now,\n\n1:31:38.460 --> 1:31:41.180\n after 20 years saying, you know, under American rule,\n\n1:31:41.180 --> 1:31:42.700\n it was a basket case, right?\n\n1:31:43.900 --> 1:31:46.620\n There was immense human suffering, incredibly violent.\n\n1:31:46.620 --> 1:31:49.140\n The world did not start counting civilian casualties\n\n1:31:49.140 --> 1:31:51.060\n in Afghanistan until 2009.\n\n1:31:51.060 --> 1:31:51.900\n I mean, think about that.\n\n1:31:51.900 --> 1:31:53.460\n The war went on for eight years.\n\n1:31:53.460 --> 1:31:54.780\n The Taliban were never really defeated.\n\n1:31:54.780 --> 1:31:56.100\n They just went to Pakistan.\n\n1:31:56.100 --> 1:31:59.180\n They went to the mountains, they went to the woods.\n\n1:31:59.180 --> 1:32:01.580\n And so all of these different American operations,\n\n1:32:01.580 --> 1:32:05.420\n as you noted, under Bush, Obama, Trump, and so on,\n\n1:32:07.460 --> 1:32:09.420\n killed countless civilians.\n\n1:32:09.420 --> 1:32:10.580\n The US never accounted for that.\n\n1:32:10.580 --> 1:32:12.220\n We never even counted.\n\n1:32:13.260 --> 1:32:15.500\n Trump escalated civilian casualties\n\n1:32:15.500 --> 1:32:17.260\n by escalating the air war.\n\n1:32:17.260 --> 1:32:19.980\n But a lot of this was like very ugly, on the ground,\n\n1:32:19.980 --> 1:32:21.260\n you know, night raid stuff,\n\n1:32:21.260 --> 1:32:25.820\n where you drop into a Hamlet and massacre people,\n\n1:32:25.820 --> 1:32:27.900\n and then you're not honest about what happened, right?\n\n1:32:27.900 --> 1:32:31.620\n So that dynamic continued to fuel the growth of the Taliban\n\n1:32:31.620 --> 1:32:32.700\n from below.\n\n1:32:32.700 --> 1:32:35.100\n So the foot soldiers, they never ran out of foot soldiers.\n\n1:32:35.100 --> 1:32:39.300\n I mean, the US and its allies killed tens of thousands,\n\n1:32:39.300 --> 1:32:41.140\n maybe hundreds of thousands of Taliban fighters\n\n1:32:41.140 --> 1:32:42.740\n over the last 20 years.\n\n1:32:42.740 --> 1:32:44.860\n But they just sprouted up again.\n\n1:32:44.860 --> 1:32:46.420\n And part of that was the kind of solidarity culture,\n\n1:32:46.420 --> 1:32:51.020\n the male bonding of martyrology, of martyrdom,\n\n1:32:51.020 --> 1:32:56.020\n and of revenge, and a sense of the foreign invader.\n\n1:32:56.020 --> 1:32:57.860\n And I've heard, I mean, I haven't taught a ton\n\n1:32:57.860 --> 1:33:01.540\n of US military people, but through the Hoover,\n\n1:33:01.540 --> 1:33:03.540\n they put officers in our classes sometimes,\n\n1:33:03.540 --> 1:33:07.220\n and met a few wonderful army and marine officers\n\n1:33:07.220 --> 1:33:08.940\n who I really enjoyed.\n\n1:33:08.940 --> 1:33:11.260\n You know, we came from the South like me,\n\n1:33:11.260 --> 1:33:12.620\n always had great rapport with them,\n\n1:33:12.620 --> 1:33:15.260\n and they expressed a range of opinions about this.\n\n1:33:15.260 --> 1:33:17.460\n I think that I learned a lot from someone who said,\n\n1:33:17.460 --> 1:33:20.020\n yeah, I mean, I get why they hate us.\n\n1:33:20.020 --> 1:33:21.860\n I get why they're still fighting,\n\n1:33:21.860 --> 1:33:25.820\n because last week, we were in the middle of a war,\n\n1:33:25.820 --> 1:33:30.820\n we just killed 14 of their fellow villagers.\n\n1:33:31.300 --> 1:33:34.780\n So the officers, the guys on the ground,\n\n1:33:34.780 --> 1:33:37.300\n fighting this war, we're not stupid about that.\n\n1:33:37.300 --> 1:33:39.500\n I mean, they got the human dimension of that,\n\n1:33:39.500 --> 1:33:41.060\n and yet no one got off the exit,\n\n1:33:41.060 --> 1:33:42.700\n as you said, people kept driving.\n\n1:33:43.940 --> 1:33:46.380\n But going forward now, internationally,\n\n1:33:46.380 --> 1:33:48.940\n it's critical that they have,\n\n1:33:48.940 --> 1:33:50.460\n and they've had meetings.\n\n1:33:50.460 --> 1:33:52.660\n I mean, what the Taliban have done since August 15th\n\n1:33:52.660 --> 1:33:54.140\n is a lot of diplomacy.\n\n1:33:54.140 --> 1:33:55.900\n They've had meetings, they've had people,\n\n1:33:55.900 --> 1:33:58.500\n they've had Tashkent come, they've had Beijing come,\n\n1:33:58.500 --> 1:34:00.300\n they've had Moscow come.\n\n1:34:00.300 --> 1:34:04.780\n I mean, they've had major visits from Islamabad,\n\n1:34:06.100 --> 1:34:09.260\n from security people, from diplomatic circles.\n\n1:34:09.260 --> 1:34:11.940\n And they're counting on things being different this time.\n\n1:34:11.940 --> 1:34:13.100\n I mean, the first time around,\n\n1:34:13.100 --> 1:34:15.900\n the only people who backed the Taliban by recognition,\n\n1:34:15.900 --> 1:34:17.620\n giving them diplomatic recognition,\n\n1:34:17.620 --> 1:34:20.260\n were the Saudis, Pakistanis, and the UAE.\n\n1:34:20.260 --> 1:34:24.420\n And because of Al Qaeda, because of opium,\n\n1:34:24.420 --> 1:34:27.020\n because of some of the human rights stuff,\n\n1:34:27.020 --> 1:34:28.420\n the US pushed everyone to like,\n\n1:34:28.420 --> 1:34:30.020\n let's not recognize the state,\n\n1:34:30.020 --> 1:34:31.260\n even though the US did.\n\n1:34:31.260 --> 1:34:33.300\n I mean, Colin Powell famously,\n\n1:34:33.300 --> 1:34:37.220\n summer of 2001, we did give a few grants and aid\n\n1:34:38.940 --> 1:34:43.940\n to the Taliban as kind of like massaging negotiations.\n\n1:34:44.420 --> 1:34:46.180\n They kept talking about bin Laden,\n\n1:34:46.180 --> 1:34:49.420\n but they also wanted them to stop opium production.\n\n1:34:49.420 --> 1:34:50.780\n I mean, Afghanistan, throughout all this period\n\n1:34:50.780 --> 1:34:52.300\n we've talked about, is the global center\n\n1:34:52.300 --> 1:34:54.220\n of opium production.\n\n1:34:54.220 --> 1:34:57.460\n I mean, over the years, more and more of the Afghan economy\n\n1:34:57.460 --> 1:35:00.460\n continued to today is devoted to the opium trade.\n\n1:35:00.460 --> 1:35:05.460\n Opium, which is the thing that leads to heroin,\n\n1:35:06.420 --> 1:35:07.780\n some of the painkillers.\n\n1:35:07.780 --> 1:35:09.180\n Yeah.\n\n1:35:09.180 --> 1:35:12.660\n And even if Afghan poppies don't make it to Hoboken,\n\n1:35:13.540 --> 1:35:18.340\n they are not the source of American deaths.\n\n1:35:18.340 --> 1:35:22.820\n They are part of a universal market, a global market,\n\n1:35:22.820 --> 1:35:25.900\n which I think any economist would tell you\n\n1:35:25.900 --> 1:35:29.660\n is part of the story of our opium problem.\n\n1:35:29.660 --> 1:35:34.660\n Something I read maybe a decade ago now,\n\n1:35:34.940 --> 1:35:36.460\n and I just kind of looked it up again\n\n1:35:36.460 --> 1:35:38.380\n to bring it up to see your opinion on this,\n\n1:35:38.380 --> 1:35:43.060\n is a 2010 report by the International Council\n\n1:35:43.060 --> 1:35:45.380\n on Security and Development that showed\n\n1:35:45.380 --> 1:35:50.380\n that 92% of Afghans in Helmand and Kandahar province\n\n1:35:52.460 --> 1:35:56.900\n know nothing of the 9 11 attacks on US in 2001.\n\n1:35:56.900 --> 1:36:00.500\n Is this at all representative of what you know?\n\n1:36:00.500 --> 1:36:01.700\n Is this possible?\n\n1:36:01.700 --> 1:36:03.860\n So basically, put another way,\n\n1:36:05.140 --> 1:36:10.060\n is it possible that a lot of Afghans don't even know\n\n1:36:10.060 --> 1:36:13.100\n the reason why there may be troops\n\n1:36:13.100 --> 1:36:17.460\n or the sort of American provided narrative\n\n1:36:17.460 --> 1:36:21.340\n for why there's troops, American soldiers,\n\n1:36:21.340 --> 1:36:25.500\n and American drones overhead in Afghanistan?\n\n1:36:25.500 --> 1:36:26.580\n Right.\n\n1:36:26.580 --> 1:36:28.700\n I mean, my gut response,\n\n1:36:28.700 --> 1:36:32.180\n not knowing the details of this actual poll is\n\n1:36:32.180 --> 1:36:37.180\n that that's a very unhelpful way to think about\n\n1:36:38.260 --> 1:36:39.940\n how Afghans relate to the world.\n\n1:36:39.940 --> 1:36:43.580\n And I think it could be, if you go to my hometown,\n\n1:36:44.780 --> 1:36:48.180\n in North Carolina, if you knock on some doors,\n\n1:36:48.180 --> 1:36:50.740\n you may meet people who don't know all kinds of things.\n\n1:36:50.740 --> 1:36:52.100\n I could probably walk around this neighborhood\n\n1:36:52.100 --> 1:36:54.180\n here in California and there'd be all kinds of people\n\n1:36:54.180 --> 1:36:56.700\n who don't know all kinds of things.\n\n1:36:57.980 --> 1:37:01.460\n Kyrie Irving apparently thinks the earth is flat.\n\n1:37:01.460 --> 1:37:06.460\n I mean, so we could make a lot of certain kinds\n\n1:37:07.260 --> 1:37:08.100\n of ignorance, I think.\n\n1:37:08.100 --> 1:37:09.980\n But I think what I would say,\n\n1:37:09.980 --> 1:37:12.140\n and there's also, I mean, a companion point maybe\n\n1:37:12.140 --> 1:37:15.140\n that in thinking about the withdrawal, the collapse,\n\n1:37:15.140 --> 1:37:17.020\n the return of the Taliban,\n\n1:37:17.020 --> 1:37:18.780\n there has been a big conversation\n\n1:37:18.780 --> 1:37:21.780\n about what Afghans think of us really.\n\n1:37:21.780 --> 1:37:24.300\n And this famous piece in the New Yorker\n\n1:37:24.300 --> 1:37:28.740\n was about how many people liked the Taliban,\n\n1:37:28.740 --> 1:37:33.740\n that many women interviewed supposedly in this piece,\n\n1:37:35.460 --> 1:37:37.340\n were sympathetic because they had lost family members\n\n1:37:37.340 --> 1:37:38.260\n and all the violence.\n\n1:37:38.260 --> 1:37:40.340\n And the idea kind of was that,\n\n1:37:41.420 --> 1:37:42.500\n we haven't thought about that at all.\n\n1:37:42.500 --> 1:37:45.340\n When in fact, of course we have and lots of people have,\n\n1:37:45.340 --> 1:37:48.300\n but I think if you're just dropping into the conversation,\n\n1:37:48.300 --> 1:37:49.780\n if you look at like an immediate arc of coverage\n\n1:37:49.780 --> 1:37:50.940\n of Afghanistan and the United States,\n\n1:37:50.940 --> 1:37:55.500\n I mean, the arc went from lots of coverage during,\n\n1:37:55.500 --> 1:37:57.780\n of course, 9.11 and its aftermath,\n\n1:37:57.780 --> 1:38:00.860\n lots of coverage during Obama's surge,\n\n1:38:00.860 --> 1:38:03.700\n and then quickly dropped down the last decade,\n\n1:38:03.700 --> 1:38:05.220\n it's been almost nothing.\n\n1:38:05.220 --> 1:38:07.380\n So if you ask the same question about Americans\n\n1:38:07.380 --> 1:38:09.500\n or of Americans, I'm not sure what they would say to you,\n\n1:38:09.500 --> 1:38:11.380\n what percentage would actually know\n\n1:38:11.380 --> 1:38:14.340\n why the US is in X, Y, or Z either, right?\n\n1:38:14.340 --> 1:38:16.220\n But on the Afghan side, just to return to that for a moment,\n\n1:38:16.220 --> 1:38:19.540\n I think that we can fetishize these provinces.\n\n1:38:19.540 --> 1:38:21.620\n They are kind of a place\n\n1:38:21.620 --> 1:38:24.140\n where Taliban support has been greatest.\n\n1:38:24.140 --> 1:38:25.620\n Also where there's been the most violence,\n\n1:38:25.620 --> 1:38:27.300\n where the Americans have been most committed\n\n1:38:27.300 --> 1:38:30.420\n to trying to root out the Taliban movement.\n\n1:38:30.420 --> 1:38:32.380\n Where exactly in the South.\n\n1:38:32.380 --> 1:38:34.500\n What are the other parts in the South of Afghanistan?\n\n1:38:34.500 --> 1:38:37.060\n Yeah, it's mostly Pashtun, not exclusively,\n\n1:38:37.060 --> 1:38:39.540\n but mostly Pashtun, mostly rural.\n\n1:38:39.540 --> 1:38:40.420\n What is Pashtun?\n\n1:38:40.420 --> 1:38:41.260\n That's the other group\n\n1:38:41.260 --> 1:38:44.740\n that the Taliban claim to represent, right?\n\n1:38:44.740 --> 1:38:45.580\n So they are this group.\n\n1:38:45.580 --> 1:38:46.660\n What other groups are there?\n\n1:38:46.660 --> 1:38:48.060\n Okay, sorry, yeah, sorry.\n\n1:38:48.060 --> 1:38:51.020\n So in cities, you'll find everything, right?\n\n1:38:51.020 --> 1:38:51.940\n That is in Afghanistan.\n\n1:38:51.940 --> 1:38:54.780\n You'll find Uzbeks, Tajiks, Hazaras.\n\n1:38:55.780 --> 1:39:00.780\n These are people who, Uzbek is a Turkic language, right?\n\n1:39:01.140 --> 1:39:03.340\n Most Uzbeks live in what is now Uzbekistan,\n\n1:39:03.340 --> 1:39:06.700\n but they form majorities in some Northern parts of the city.\n\n1:39:06.700 --> 1:39:08.700\n I'm sorry, of the country of Afghanistan.\n\n1:39:08.700 --> 1:39:10.340\n But what I emphasize is that,\n\n1:39:11.620 --> 1:39:14.060\n and you can find online an ethnographic map of Afghanistan\n\n1:39:14.060 --> 1:39:16.860\n and you'll see green where Pashtuns live,\n\n1:39:16.860 --> 1:39:20.460\n red where Hazaras live, orange where Uzbeks live,\n\n1:39:20.460 --> 1:39:22.460\n purple where Tajiks live.\n\n1:39:22.460 --> 1:39:23.940\n Then there are a bunch of other smaller groups\n\n1:39:23.940 --> 1:39:25.500\n of different kinds.\n\n1:39:25.500 --> 1:39:30.500\n There are Noristanis, there are Baluch,\n\n1:39:30.620 --> 1:39:32.620\n there are, in different religious communities,\n\n1:39:32.620 --> 1:39:34.940\n there are Sunni, Shia, different kinds of Shia.\n\n1:39:34.940 --> 1:39:36.660\n What are the key differences between them?\n\n1:39:36.660 --> 1:39:39.940\n Is it religious basis from the origins\n\n1:39:39.940 --> 1:39:43.380\n of where they immigrated from and how different are they?\n\n1:39:43.380 --> 1:39:46.180\n So they're all, I mean, they're all indigenous, I think.\n\n1:39:46.180 --> 1:39:47.260\n I mean, there's a kind of mythology\n\n1:39:47.260 --> 1:39:49.540\n that some groups have been there longer, right?\n\n1:39:49.540 --> 1:39:50.980\n So they have a greater claim to power.\n\n1:39:50.980 --> 1:39:55.100\n But historically, I mean, it's like, you know,\n\n1:39:55.100 --> 1:39:55.940\n ethnic groups anywhere,\n\n1:39:55.940 --> 1:39:58.460\n people have different narratives about themselves,\n\n1:39:58.460 --> 1:40:01.860\n but many Pashtuns would tell you, not all,\n\n1:40:01.860 --> 1:40:03.340\n but many would say,\n\n1:40:03.340 --> 1:40:05.780\n we are the kind of state builders of Afghanistan.\n\n1:40:05.780 --> 1:40:09.620\n The dynasty that ruled much of the space,\n\n1:40:09.620 --> 1:40:12.100\n that was born in the mid 18th century,\n\n1:40:12.100 --> 1:40:15.380\n that ruled until 1973, more or less,\n\n1:40:15.380 --> 1:40:18.420\n generalizing, you know, it was a Pashtun dynasty.\n\n1:40:18.420 --> 1:40:21.820\n The Taliban have definitely said to some audiences,\n\n1:40:21.820 --> 1:40:24.900\n we are the rightful rulers because we are Pashtun.\n\n1:40:26.620 --> 1:40:28.580\n The trick though is, I don't mean to be evasive,\n\n1:40:28.580 --> 1:40:30.700\n but just to convey some of the complexity,\n\n1:40:30.700 --> 1:40:32.780\n one quick answer as well,\n\n1:40:32.780 --> 1:40:34.420\n they're majorities and minorities.\n\n1:40:34.420 --> 1:40:37.420\n I mean, one finds that a lot along with those maps,\n\n1:40:37.420 --> 1:40:40.940\n but I would say suspend any firm belief in that\n\n1:40:40.940 --> 1:40:42.980\n because that could be entirely wrong.\n\n1:40:42.980 --> 1:40:47.100\n In fact, there's never been a modern census of Afghanistan.\n\n1:40:47.100 --> 1:40:49.980\n So when journalists say Pashtuns are the majority,\n\n1:40:49.980 --> 1:40:53.220\n or they're the biggest group, I would say not so fast.\n\n1:40:53.220 --> 1:40:54.060\n I would say not so fast\n\n1:40:54.060 --> 1:40:57.020\n because of migration is one major issue.\n\n1:40:57.020 --> 1:41:00.060\n No major modern census.\n\n1:41:00.060 --> 1:41:01.260\n Actually, the Soviets got pretty close,\n\n1:41:01.260 --> 1:41:04.060\n but didn't quite, you know, find something comprehensive\n\n1:41:04.060 --> 1:41:06.260\n and didn't publicize it knowing that it was,\n\n1:41:07.380 --> 1:41:08.220\n you know, in modern times,\n\n1:41:08.220 --> 1:41:11.060\n ethnicity can be the source of political mobilization.\n\n1:41:11.060 --> 1:41:14.740\n It's not innately so, but it's been part of the story.\n\n1:41:14.740 --> 1:41:16.020\n But then you have mixed families, right?\n\n1:41:16.020 --> 1:41:17.740\n So a lot of people you'll meet,\n\n1:41:17.740 --> 1:41:19.140\n you'll encounter in the diaspora and around,\n\n1:41:19.140 --> 1:41:22.340\n I mean, well, I am, you know,\n\n1:41:22.340 --> 1:41:26.220\n my one parent is Tajik, one is Pashtun, right?\n\n1:41:26.220 --> 1:41:27.980\n Or I'm Pashtun, as I mentioned before,\n\n1:41:27.980 --> 1:41:29.980\n but I don't speak Pashto, right?\n\n1:41:29.980 --> 1:41:34.980\n Or I am Hazara, but you read about us as Shiite Hazara,\n\n1:41:35.100 --> 1:41:36.900\n in fact, I'm a Sunni Hazara,\n\n1:41:36.900 --> 1:41:39.380\n or I'm a secular Hazara, or I'm an atheist Hazara.\n\n1:41:39.380 --> 1:41:41.940\n I mean, everything's possible, right?\n\n1:41:41.940 --> 1:41:46.100\n One of my friends, if he were here,\n\n1:41:46.100 --> 1:41:49.140\n he'd say, I'm Kabuli, you know, I'm from Kabul.\n\n1:41:49.140 --> 1:41:51.140\n So if you think about it in Russian terms,\n\n1:41:51.140 --> 1:41:53.260\n you know, it means a lot if you're a Muscovitch,\n\n1:41:53.260 --> 1:41:57.060\n you know, if you're from Pisa or Moscow, I mean, you know.\n\n1:41:57.060 --> 1:42:02.060\n Yeah, well, even here is Pashtunians, Texans, Californians.\n\n1:42:04.460 --> 1:42:07.340\n Yeah, East Coast, West Coast, all that stuff.\n\n1:42:07.340 --> 1:42:08.820\n Those are all part of the mix here.\n\n1:42:08.820 --> 1:42:10.980\n So you asked about Kandahar and Helmand,\n\n1:42:10.980 --> 1:42:14.580\n then I would say, yeah, if you go out to, you know,\n\n1:42:14.580 --> 1:42:18.340\n a pomegranate field, you'll meet a guy\n\n1:42:18.340 --> 1:42:22.460\n who may reckon time differently from you and me,\n\n1:42:22.460 --> 1:42:24.860\n who may not be literate,\n\n1:42:24.860 --> 1:42:27.900\n you may not have ever had a geography lesson,\n\n1:42:27.900 --> 1:42:30.780\n but if you go one door over, you may meet a guy\n\n1:42:31.700 --> 1:42:36.020\n who, you know, his life path has taken him\n\n1:42:36.020 --> 1:42:38.500\n to live in, you know, six countries.\n\n1:42:38.500 --> 1:42:40.340\n He may speak five languages.\n\n1:42:40.340 --> 1:42:41.780\n And these are all things I'm not saying they're all,\n\n1:42:41.780 --> 1:42:43.300\n these are just because people have money\n\n1:42:43.300 --> 1:42:44.140\n can go fly around.\n\n1:42:44.140 --> 1:42:46.860\n I mean, there are people who are displaced by war\n\n1:42:46.860 --> 1:42:48.500\n from late 1970s, right?\n\n1:42:48.500 --> 1:42:50.180\n Even already in the early 70s,\n\n1:42:50.180 --> 1:42:53.620\n people were traveling by the tens of thousands to Iran,\n\n1:42:53.620 --> 1:42:55.220\n you know, as labor migrants.\n\n1:42:55.220 --> 1:42:56.940\n And once you get to Iran, once you get to Pakistan,\n\n1:42:56.940 --> 1:42:59.500\n once you get to Uzbekistan,\n\n1:42:59.500 --> 1:43:02.620\n you then connect to all kinds of cosmopolitan cultures.\n\n1:43:02.620 --> 1:43:04.900\n And in fact, I think one of the themes of the book,\n\n1:43:04.900 --> 1:43:06.020\n you know, that you may or may not have read,\n\n1:43:06.020 --> 1:43:07.740\n it may put you to sleep.\n\n1:43:07.740 --> 1:43:09.580\n You know, Afghan Modern was about, you know,\n\n1:43:09.580 --> 1:43:11.820\n conceptualizing Afghanistan as a cosmopolitan place\n\n1:43:11.820 --> 1:43:14.860\n where for centuries people put on the move\n\n1:43:14.860 --> 1:43:15.700\n and trade in this area.\n\n1:43:15.700 --> 1:43:17.900\n You think of, you know, I think this mischaracterization\n\n1:43:17.900 --> 1:43:20.460\n of places like Helmand and Kandahar,\n\n1:43:20.460 --> 1:43:24.460\n you know, you fly in or you're part of a Marine battalion\n\n1:43:24.460 --> 1:43:26.620\n and you see people there and they look different.\n\n1:43:26.620 --> 1:43:30.220\n And I think in our imagination, if I can generalize,\n\n1:43:30.220 --> 1:43:31.860\n you know, they look like they've been there\n\n1:43:31.860 --> 1:43:33.420\n for millennia, right?\n\n1:43:33.420 --> 1:43:34.860\n The dress, the whatever, right?\n\n1:43:34.860 --> 1:43:35.980\n You think of technology,\n\n1:43:35.980 --> 1:43:38.700\n you think of the mud compounds and so on.\n\n1:43:38.700 --> 1:43:42.740\n You think of, you know, animal drawn transportation,\n\n1:43:42.740 --> 1:43:43.940\n that kind of stuff, right?\n\n1:43:43.940 --> 1:43:46.660\n Or the motorbike, right, at most is what they have.\n\n1:43:46.660 --> 1:43:49.220\n But in fact, if you follow those families,\n\n1:43:49.220 --> 1:43:51.940\n their trade has taken them to Northern India\n\n1:43:51.940 --> 1:43:53.100\n for centuries, right?\n\n1:43:53.100 --> 1:43:56.260\n Their trade has connected them to cosmopolitan centers.\n\n1:43:56.260 --> 1:43:58.060\n You know, say they have a scholar in the family,\n\n1:43:58.060 --> 1:43:59.740\n that scholar may have studied\n\n1:43:59.740 --> 1:44:02.220\n all of the Middle East, South Asia, right?\n\n1:44:02.220 --> 1:44:03.940\n You know, their ancestors may have been horse traders\n\n1:44:03.940 --> 1:44:05.660\n who went all the way to Moscow, right?\n\n1:44:05.660 --> 1:44:07.860\n I mean, we have a sort of records of all these people\n\n1:44:07.860 --> 1:44:10.420\n traveling across Eurasia,\n\n1:44:10.420 --> 1:44:12.580\n pursuing all kinds of livelihoods.\n\n1:44:12.580 --> 1:44:14.700\n And so Afghanistan is this paradox\n\n1:44:14.700 --> 1:44:17.300\n of visually looking remote\n\n1:44:17.300 --> 1:44:20.260\n and looking like it's kind of stuck in time,\n\n1:44:20.260 --> 1:44:22.660\n but the family trajectories\n\n1:44:22.660 --> 1:44:23.740\n and the current trajectories\n\n1:44:23.740 --> 1:44:26.420\n are astoundingly cosmopolitan and mobile.\n\n1:44:26.420 --> 1:44:29.860\n And so, and a conception of being a world center\n\n1:44:29.860 --> 1:44:30.900\n is also quite strong.\n\n1:44:30.900 --> 1:44:33.820\n So, you know, another way to frame that question about like,\n\n1:44:33.820 --> 1:44:36.220\n do they know about 9.11 would be like,\n\n1:44:36.220 --> 1:44:37.420\n why should we know about 9.11?\n\n1:44:37.420 --> 1:44:39.660\n Because we are at the center of something important, right?\n\n1:44:39.660 --> 1:44:41.140\n We are the center of Asia.\n\n1:44:41.140 --> 1:44:42.900\n We are the heart of Asia.\n\n1:44:42.900 --> 1:44:44.540\n We have a kind of historic greatness.\n\n1:44:44.540 --> 1:44:49.180\n We are a proud culture of our own achievements, right?\n\n1:44:49.180 --> 1:44:51.780\n So we're not worried about that, right?\n\n1:44:51.780 --> 1:44:53.020\n That said, I mean, sure,\n\n1:44:53.020 --> 1:44:54.780\n there are different narratives about\n\n1:44:54.780 --> 1:44:56.100\n why Americans are there,\n\n1:44:56.100 --> 1:44:57.860\n why people are being killed.\n\n1:44:57.860 --> 1:45:00.300\n You know, of course you'd find,\n\n1:45:00.300 --> 1:45:02.100\n they want to convert us,\n\n1:45:02.100 --> 1:45:03.180\n they want our gold,\n\n1:45:03.180 --> 1:45:04.620\n they want our opium,\n\n1:45:04.620 --> 1:45:06.580\n they want X, Y, and Z, right?\n\n1:45:06.580 --> 1:45:10.700\n There was a recent story about a Taliban official\n\n1:45:10.700 --> 1:45:11.780\n sitting in an office in Kabul\n\n1:45:11.780 --> 1:45:12.620\n and a journalist asked him,\n\n1:45:12.620 --> 1:45:15.180\n what can you find in this rotating globe?\n\n1:45:15.180 --> 1:45:16.020\n Find your country,\n\n1:45:16.020 --> 1:45:17.900\n find where are we sitting right now?\n\n1:45:17.900 --> 1:45:21.460\n And he was filmed not being able to do it.\n\n1:45:21.460 --> 1:45:22.420\n And so a lot of, you know,\n\n1:45:22.420 --> 1:45:23.740\n race sophisticated Afghans in the diaspora\n\n1:45:23.740 --> 1:45:25.900\n were saying, you know, ha ha, look at this.\n\n1:45:25.900 --> 1:45:27.260\n And that exists.\n\n1:45:27.260 --> 1:45:29.860\n I mean, I think I could go to my Stanford classroom\n\n1:45:29.860 --> 1:45:30.700\n and there'd be a lot of kids\n\n1:45:30.700 --> 1:45:32.580\n who wouldn't know where Afghanistan is too, right?\n\n1:45:32.580 --> 1:45:35.580\n But I guess I wouldn't use those metrics\n\n1:45:35.580 --> 1:45:38.220\n to suggest that this is a place\n\n1:45:38.220 --> 1:45:40.340\n that doesn't have a sense of its place in the world\n\n1:45:40.340 --> 1:45:42.300\n and of geopolitics.\n\n1:45:42.300 --> 1:45:43.220\n I think if anything,\n\n1:45:43.220 --> 1:45:44.500\n being a relatively small country\n\n1:45:44.500 --> 1:45:46.620\n in a very complicated neighborhood,\n\n1:45:46.620 --> 1:45:48.340\n I mean, everybody, every cab driver,\n\n1:45:48.340 --> 1:45:49.740\n I mean, people have, I mean,\n\n1:45:50.620 --> 1:45:52.420\n you know, this is where America is different\n\n1:45:52.420 --> 1:45:54.340\n because I don't think Americans have this sense.\n\n1:45:54.340 --> 1:45:55.860\n You know, we're talking about Moscow and stuff.\n\n1:45:55.860 --> 1:45:58.740\n I think, you know, Moscow cab drivers,\n\n1:45:59.820 --> 1:46:01.580\n I think a lot of them are gonna tell you,\n\n1:46:01.580 --> 1:46:04.460\n like what's happening in the world and why, right?\n\n1:46:04.460 --> 1:46:07.020\n And it's just part of their thing, right?\n\n1:46:07.020 --> 1:46:07.940\n You can find that in Ghana,\n\n1:46:07.940 --> 1:46:09.100\n you can find that in Mexico city, right?\n\n1:46:09.100 --> 1:46:10.220\n You find that lots of places.\n\n1:46:10.220 --> 1:46:13.660\n So I think Afghans are part of a very sophisticated\n\n1:46:13.660 --> 1:46:17.940\n kind of mapping of the world and where they fit in.\n\n1:46:17.940 --> 1:46:20.020\n And a lot of them remarkably had done it firsthand,\n\n1:46:20.020 --> 1:46:21.340\n which is what struck me so much.\n\n1:46:21.340 --> 1:46:22.980\n And, you know, really my experiences\n\n1:46:22.980 --> 1:46:24.460\n from the 1990s and Tashkent places\n\n1:46:24.460 --> 1:46:26.380\n that these guys had already lived\n\n1:46:26.380 --> 1:46:28.420\n in more countries than I'd ever been.\n\n1:46:28.420 --> 1:46:30.100\n They already knew half those languages.\n\n1:46:30.100 --> 1:46:33.220\n I mean, this one friend's Russian was impeccable.\n\n1:46:34.140 --> 1:46:36.460\n And of course it helped, they had Russian girlfriends,\n\n1:46:36.460 --> 1:46:38.780\n they had, you know, they mixed with the police,\n\n1:46:38.780 --> 1:46:40.700\n they had run ins, I mean,\n\n1:46:40.700 --> 1:46:42.940\n this wasn't something you got from a book, right?\n\n1:46:42.940 --> 1:46:44.940\n This was like hard knock life.\n\n1:46:44.940 --> 1:46:47.660\n I mean, one friend was from a wealthy family\n\n1:46:48.580 --> 1:46:51.180\n in this trading diaspora and he was imprisoned.\n\n1:46:51.180 --> 1:46:54.060\n I mean, they sent him to prison in Pakistan\n\n1:46:54.060 --> 1:46:57.140\n and he talks about how he could start like running,\n\n1:46:57.140 --> 1:46:58.900\n running in the jail, you know,\n\n1:46:58.900 --> 1:47:00.580\n taking cigarettes to people, doing little things\n\n1:47:00.580 --> 1:47:03.980\n and kind of, you know, these are not stories of like,\n\n1:47:03.980 --> 1:47:06.020\n oh, I went to Harvard and so I'm so learned\n\n1:47:06.020 --> 1:47:06.860\n because of this.\n\n1:47:06.860 --> 1:47:08.860\n I mean, it's a whole range of experiences.\n\n1:47:08.860 --> 1:47:10.860\n The interesting thing is the survey is a survey\n\n1:47:10.860 --> 1:47:15.860\n and it doesn't reflect ignorance,\n\n1:47:16.500 --> 1:47:18.900\n as you're saying, perhaps,\n\n1:47:18.900 --> 1:47:22.460\n but it may reflect a different geopolitical view\n\n1:47:22.460 --> 1:47:25.660\n of the world than the West has.\n\n1:47:25.660 --> 1:47:29.260\n So if, you know, for a lot of the world,\n\n1:47:29.260 --> 1:47:33.220\n 9 11 was one of the most important moments\n\n1:47:33.220 --> 1:47:35.580\n of recent human history.\n\n1:47:35.580 --> 1:47:38.540\n And for Afghanistan to not to know that,\n\n1:47:38.540 --> 1:47:41.420\n especially when they're part of that story,\n\n1:47:41.420 --> 1:47:43.060\n means they have a very different,\n\n1:47:43.060 --> 1:47:46.140\n like there could be a lot of things said.\n\n1:47:46.140 --> 1:47:49.660\n One is the spread of information is different.\n\n1:47:49.660 --> 1:47:52.540\n The channels of the way information is spread.\n\n1:47:52.540 --> 1:47:54.900\n And two of the things they care about,\n\n1:47:54.900 --> 1:47:59.900\n maybe they see themselves as part of a longer arc\n\n1:47:59.980 --> 1:48:03.980\n of history where the bickering of these superpowers\n\n1:48:03.980 --> 1:48:06.220\n that seem to want to go to the moon\n\n1:48:06.220 --> 1:48:09.220\n are not as important as the big sort of arc\n\n1:48:09.220 --> 1:48:11.300\n that's been the story of Afghanistan.\n\n1:48:13.020 --> 1:48:15.100\n You know, that's an interesting idea,\n\n1:48:15.100 --> 1:48:18.220\n but it's still a bit, if at all,\n\n1:48:18.220 --> 1:48:20.100\n representative of the truth.\n\n1:48:20.100 --> 1:48:23.340\n It's heartbreaking that they're not,\n\n1:48:23.340 --> 1:48:28.340\n do not see themselves as active player\n\n1:48:28.700 --> 1:48:32.940\n in this game between the United States\n\n1:48:32.940 --> 1:48:37.420\n and Central Asia, because they're such a critical player.\n\n1:48:37.420 --> 1:48:41.580\n And I feel, and obviously, in many ways,\n\n1:48:41.580 --> 1:48:44.300\n get the short end of the stick in this whole interaction\n\n1:48:44.300 --> 1:48:49.300\n with the invasion of Afghanistan for many years,\n\n1:48:50.100 --> 1:48:54.580\n and then this rushed withdrawal of troops,\n\n1:48:54.580 --> 1:49:03.580\n and now the economic collapse, and it's sad in some ways.\n\n1:49:04.100 --> 1:49:04.940\n That's right.\n\n1:49:04.940 --> 1:49:07.540\n I mean, you know, another way to put it is this.\n\n1:49:07.540 --> 1:49:08.820\n I mean, yeah, there's a range of knowledge,\n\n1:49:08.820 --> 1:49:10.180\n and you're right, the information flows\n\n1:49:10.180 --> 1:49:14.260\n are peculiar to particular geographies\n\n1:49:14.260 --> 1:49:15.100\n and histories and stuff.\n\n1:49:15.100 --> 1:49:17.300\n I think that, you know, plucking out one sample\n\n1:49:17.300 --> 1:49:20.180\n from some fairly remote area,\n\n1:49:20.180 --> 1:49:22.700\n from one like follow the agricultural products.\n\n1:49:22.700 --> 1:49:24.940\n I mean, and this is where, you know,\n\n1:49:24.940 --> 1:49:29.500\n I think urban rural divides used to mean a lot more\n\n1:49:29.500 --> 1:49:30.460\n in the 19th century, right?\n\n1:49:30.460 --> 1:49:32.700\n So a lot of like the nuts and bolts of history\n\n1:49:32.700 --> 1:49:35.780\n is about conceiving of these kinds of distinctions,\n\n1:49:35.780 --> 1:49:37.900\n but I think that if one has the privilege\n\n1:49:37.900 --> 1:49:40.740\n of traveling a bit, you see that like urban areas\n\n1:49:40.740 --> 1:49:43.420\n are fed by rural hinterlands.\n\n1:49:43.420 --> 1:49:47.060\n And if you think of who actually brings the bread,\n\n1:49:47.060 --> 1:49:49.740\n the milk, the pomegranates and so on,\n\n1:49:49.740 --> 1:49:50.740\n it creates these networks.\n\n1:49:50.740 --> 1:49:53.620\n And then, you know, mobility channels,\n\n1:49:53.620 --> 1:49:55.740\n information and so on.\n\n1:49:55.740 --> 1:49:57.220\n But yeah, but your broader point\n\n1:49:57.220 --> 1:49:58.060\n about like the tragedy of this,\n\n1:49:58.060 --> 1:50:01.140\n I mean, I guess if I can quote a brilliant student of mine,\n\n1:50:01.140 --> 1:50:04.220\n an Afghan American woman who just received her PhD,\n\n1:50:04.220 --> 1:50:07.980\n who's now, you know, a doctor, he's a great scholar.\n\n1:50:07.980 --> 1:50:10.620\n You know, we've done several events now\n\n1:50:10.620 --> 1:50:11.980\n trying to just think through what's happened.\n\n1:50:11.980 --> 1:50:14.620\n And of course, she's very emotionally affected by it.\n\n1:50:14.620 --> 1:50:17.340\n And she continues to ask a really great question.\n\n1:50:17.340 --> 1:50:19.780\n If I can get her phrasing right, you know,\n\n1:50:19.780 --> 1:50:21.500\n if you think of the cycle of like the Taliban\n\n1:50:21.500 --> 1:50:24.340\n being in power in 2001 and the way in which\n\n1:50:24.340 --> 1:50:25.660\n that affected women in particular,\n\n1:50:25.660 --> 1:50:28.940\n you know, half Afghan, half of the society, right?\n\n1:50:28.940 --> 1:50:30.980\n Then you think of this 20 year period of violence\n\n1:50:30.980 --> 1:50:34.340\n and, you know, missed exits, right?\n\n1:50:34.340 --> 1:50:38.300\n And repeated tragedy that also it created a space.\n\n1:50:38.300 --> 1:50:39.980\n I mean, it created a space for a whole generation.\n\n1:50:39.980 --> 1:50:41.340\n I'd say generationally, it created a sense,\n\n1:50:41.340 --> 1:50:44.380\n a space for people to realize something new.\n\n1:50:44.380 --> 1:50:47.020\n And I think, so we have to attend to the dynamism\n\n1:50:47.020 --> 1:50:47.860\n of the society, right?\n\n1:50:47.860 --> 1:50:51.100\n So yeah, this happened mostly in Kabul,\n\n1:50:51.100 --> 1:50:53.900\n other big cities, Mazar Sharif, Herat, and Kandahar.\n\n1:50:55.420 --> 1:50:56.700\n But you can't limit your analysis to that\n\n1:50:56.700 --> 1:51:00.540\n because things like radio, television,\n\n1:51:00.540 --> 1:51:02.340\n everyone got a TV channel.\n\n1:51:02.340 --> 1:51:05.340\n There's a wonderful documentary called Afghan Star\n\n1:51:05.340 --> 1:51:07.420\n that I recommend to your listeners and viewers\n\n1:51:07.420 --> 1:51:10.620\n that it's about a singing show, a singing contest show.\n\n1:51:10.620 --> 1:51:12.100\n But you see just for some of these things\n\n1:51:12.100 --> 1:51:14.060\n about like connections, I mean,\n\n1:51:14.060 --> 1:51:17.940\n it's a show by an independent television network\n\n1:51:17.940 --> 1:51:21.180\n that did drama, it did kind of infomercials\n\n1:51:21.180 --> 1:51:24.300\n for the government and huge American investment in it.\n\n1:51:24.300 --> 1:51:25.540\n So it wasn't politically neutral,\n\n1:51:25.540 --> 1:51:27.660\n but it did talk shows, did all this kind of stuff.\n\n1:51:27.660 --> 1:51:31.820\n But it did a singing show that became incredibly popular,\n\n1:51:31.820 --> 1:51:33.300\n modeled upon the British American,\n\n1:51:33.300 --> 1:51:35.260\n you know, American Idol kind of stuff, you know,\n\n1:51:35.260 --> 1:51:36.260\n and you could vote.\n\n1:51:36.260 --> 1:51:39.020\n So it had a kind of democratic practice element.\n\n1:51:39.020 --> 1:51:41.260\n But it's fascinating to see that, you know,\n\n1:51:41.260 --> 1:51:44.780\n people hooked up generators to televisions and watch this,\n\n1:51:44.780 --> 1:51:46.940\n you know, you think of like literacy rates,\n\n1:51:46.940 --> 1:51:47.980\n literacy rates are imperfect.\n\n1:51:47.980 --> 1:51:50.620\n And, you know, people who study, you know,\n\n1:51:50.620 --> 1:51:52.860\n medieval or modern Europe talk about how,\n\n1:51:52.860 --> 1:51:56.100\n yeah, no one could read and there weren't many books,\n\n1:51:56.100 --> 1:51:58.700\n but if someone had a book, it'd be read aloud\n\n1:51:58.700 --> 1:52:00.340\n to a whole village potentially or gathering.\n\n1:52:00.340 --> 1:52:01.460\n So there isn't much, you know,\n\n1:52:01.460 --> 1:52:03.780\n some of these metrics don't get what people actually\n\n1:52:03.780 --> 1:52:05.180\n receive as information or exposure\n\n1:52:05.180 --> 1:52:08.900\n because there's the magnifying power of open spaces\n\n1:52:08.900 --> 1:52:11.540\n and hearing radio in group settings,\n\n1:52:11.540 --> 1:52:15.340\n seeing television group settings, having telephone,\n\n1:52:15.340 --> 1:52:18.420\n you know, cheap telephones, which then become an access\n\n1:52:18.420 --> 1:52:20.380\n point to the world and social media, right?\n\n1:52:20.380 --> 1:52:23.140\n So all the stuff swept across Afghan society\n\n1:52:23.140 --> 1:52:28.140\n as it did elsewhere, you know, in the last decade or more.\n\n1:52:28.260 --> 1:52:31.180\n So Afghan society became, you know, in important ways,\n\n1:52:31.180 --> 1:52:33.300\n really connected to everything going on.\n\n1:52:33.300 --> 1:52:34.460\n And so you see that reflected politically\n\n1:52:34.460 --> 1:52:35.300\n and what people wanted.\n\n1:52:35.300 --> 1:52:37.300\n So you had some people obviously\n\n1:52:37.300 --> 1:52:39.020\n back to return to the Taliban,\n\n1:52:39.020 --> 1:52:41.180\n some people wanted the status quo,\n\n1:52:41.180 --> 1:52:44.260\n but increasingly many more people wanted something else.\n\n1:52:44.260 --> 1:52:45.700\n And one of the great failures was\n\n1:52:45.700 --> 1:52:47.980\n to expose people to democracy,\n\n1:52:47.980 --> 1:52:50.020\n but only give them the rigged version.\n\n1:52:50.020 --> 1:52:52.780\n And so the US State Department in particular\n\n1:52:52.780 --> 1:52:55.060\n continued to double down on faked elections\n\n1:52:55.060 --> 1:52:57.860\n for the parliament and for the presidency in Afghanistan.\n\n1:52:57.860 --> 1:52:58.980\n What kind of elections?\n\n1:52:58.980 --> 1:53:02.140\n Faked, fraudulent elections for parliament\n\n1:53:02.140 --> 1:53:06.740\n and for president in Afghanistan again and again\n\n1:53:06.740 --> 1:53:08.300\n from the very beginning.\n\n1:53:08.300 --> 1:53:12.260\n And those elections were partly theater for the US,\n\n1:53:12.260 --> 1:53:14.380\n like for remaining on the road that you're describing,\n\n1:53:14.380 --> 1:53:15.820\n right, for not deviating, for not exiting\n\n1:53:15.820 --> 1:53:18.660\n because we were building democracy there.\n\n1:53:18.660 --> 1:53:19.820\n In reality, the US government knew\n\n1:53:19.820 --> 1:53:21.940\n it was never really building democracy there.\n\n1:53:21.940 --> 1:53:24.100\n It was establishing control\n\n1:53:24.100 --> 1:53:26.540\n and elections were one of the means to gather control,\n\n1:53:26.540 --> 1:53:27.380\n right?\n\n1:53:27.380 --> 1:53:28.460\n But then you had on the ground,\n\n1:53:28.460 --> 1:53:32.100\n especially among young people going to university,\n\n1:53:32.100 --> 1:53:33.340\n you know, having experiences\n\n1:53:33.340 --> 1:53:36.180\n that were denied to them before,\n\n1:53:36.180 --> 1:53:37.620\n you know, they took these problems so seriously.\n\n1:53:37.620 --> 1:53:40.060\n So part of the disillusionment that we see today\n\n1:53:40.060 --> 1:53:43.340\n is that, you know, they believe what the US told them\n\n1:53:43.340 --> 1:53:45.100\n that they're constructing democracy.\n\n1:53:45.100 --> 1:53:46.980\n And of course, you know, cynics like us may be thinking,\n\n1:53:46.980 --> 1:53:49.300\n well, you know, you're not really doing that.\n\n1:53:49.300 --> 1:53:50.420\n You're backing fraud.\n\n1:53:50.420 --> 1:53:52.180\n They believed it when they were younger\n\n1:53:52.180 --> 1:53:54.060\n and now they're actually smart enough\n\n1:53:54.060 --> 1:53:56.380\n to understand that it's a farce.\n\n1:53:56.380 --> 1:53:59.140\n But in so indirectly had the consequence\n\n1:53:59.140 --> 1:54:03.460\n of actually working and that it taught the young\n\n1:54:03.460 --> 1:54:07.020\n over a period of 20 years, young folks to believe\n\n1:54:07.020 --> 1:54:08.420\n that democracy is possible\n\n1:54:08.420 --> 1:54:10.860\n and then to realize what democracy is not.\n\n1:54:10.860 --> 1:54:11.700\n It's just the current system.\n\n1:54:11.700 --> 1:54:12.780\n That's beautifully said, beautifully said.\n\n1:54:12.780 --> 1:54:15.460\n And so, but now look at us, now it's, you know,\n\n1:54:15.460 --> 1:54:17.900\n it's now November.\n\n1:54:17.900 --> 1:54:21.620\n And so this whole period,\n\n1:54:21.620 --> 1:54:23.300\n and I wouldn't say like, you know,\n\n1:54:23.300 --> 1:54:25.540\n I wouldn't cast the last 20 years\n\n1:54:25.540 --> 1:54:27.780\n if we're looking at all the achievements, you know,\n\n1:54:27.780 --> 1:54:30.220\n I wouldn't put them in an American tally sheet,\n\n1:54:30.220 --> 1:54:31.620\n like, oh, this is something\n\n1:54:31.620 --> 1:54:32.660\n we should pat ourselves on the back for.\n\n1:54:32.660 --> 1:54:34.540\n I think that much of this happened actually\n\n1:54:34.540 --> 1:54:35.940\n against what the Americans wanted.\n\n1:54:35.940 --> 1:54:39.260\n I mean, that the kind of free thinking,\n\n1:54:39.260 --> 1:54:42.340\n democracy wanting, I mean, even like, you know,\n\n1:54:42.340 --> 1:54:43.260\n we could point out on the religious,\n\n1:54:43.260 --> 1:54:44.100\n go back to the religious sphere.\n\n1:54:44.100 --> 1:54:47.780\n I mean, the African religious landscape\n\n1:54:47.780 --> 1:54:49.300\n became very pluralistic.\n\n1:54:50.220 --> 1:54:52.100\n Lots of young people wanted a different kind\n\n1:54:52.100 --> 1:54:56.300\n of secular politics, but the old guard\n\n1:54:56.300 --> 1:54:59.020\n who wanted the status quo and wanted something\n\n1:54:59.020 --> 1:55:01.220\n that they'd fought for in 1980s tended\n\n1:55:01.220 --> 1:55:04.060\n to still get American backing as the political leads,\n\n1:55:04.060 --> 1:55:06.860\n who still tended to monopolize political power.\n\n1:55:06.860 --> 1:55:09.460\n So all this stuff was happening in different ways.\n\n1:55:09.460 --> 1:55:10.740\n I mean, the Americans established\n\n1:55:10.740 --> 1:55:12.780\n this American University of Afghanistan,\n\n1:55:12.780 --> 1:55:13.940\n which was, I think, one of the best things\n\n1:55:13.940 --> 1:55:14.780\n the U.S. did there.\n\n1:55:14.780 --> 1:55:18.020\n And I regret that the U.S. didn't fund 20 more,\n\n1:55:18.020 --> 1:55:19.940\n you know, sprinkling them across the country,\n\n1:55:19.940 --> 1:55:20.780\n making them accessible to people,\n\n1:55:20.780 --> 1:55:23.140\n because it was, you know, again,\n\n1:55:23.140 --> 1:55:26.420\n it wasn't an engine of Americanization.\n\n1:55:26.420 --> 1:55:27.260\n It was just opportunity.\n\n1:55:27.260 --> 1:55:28.660\n And so the thirst for higher education\n\n1:55:28.660 --> 1:55:29.860\n was really extraordinary there.\n\n1:55:29.860 --> 1:55:31.020\n It was never really met.\n\n1:55:31.020 --> 1:55:34.180\n The U.S. tended to put money in primary education,\n\n1:55:34.180 --> 1:55:37.060\n which much of that too was fraudulent.\n\n1:55:37.060 --> 1:55:38.420\n But so you have all this interesting dynamism.\n\n1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:42.220\n You have, you know, the arts, you have a critical space.\n\n1:55:42.220 --> 1:55:43.660\n I mean, I call it a public sphere\n\n1:55:43.660 --> 1:55:45.660\n in the classic European sense.\n\n1:55:45.660 --> 1:55:46.780\n You know, the Afghans made of their own.\n\n1:55:46.780 --> 1:55:49.180\n And again, it wasn't Americanization.\n\n1:55:49.180 --> 1:55:51.500\n It wasn't imposed.\n\n1:55:51.500 --> 1:55:54.220\n It was something that Afghans built across generations,\n\n1:55:54.220 --> 1:55:58.340\n but really with a firm foundation among youth,\n\n1:55:58.340 --> 1:56:01.620\n who wanted, importantly, a multiethnic Afghan society.\n\n1:56:01.620 --> 1:56:03.660\n You asked about Pashtuns and that kind of stuff.\n\n1:56:03.660 --> 1:56:07.660\n And a lot of that language in recent years was,\n\n1:56:07.660 --> 1:56:09.820\n they were aware that the U.S.-backed government\n\n1:56:09.820 --> 1:56:11.860\n was playing ethnic politics\n\n1:56:11.860 --> 1:56:14.460\n and trying to kind of put people on the blocks\n\n1:56:14.460 --> 1:56:17.860\n and mobilize people based on their ethnic identity.\n\n1:56:17.860 --> 1:56:19.820\n And there was a younger cohort of people who said,\n\n1:56:19.820 --> 1:56:21.540\n you know, we are Afghan.\n\n1:56:21.540 --> 1:56:23.260\n And then there was interesting social media stuff\n\n1:56:23.260 --> 1:56:25.580\n where people would say, I am Hazara,\n\n1:56:25.580 --> 1:56:28.340\n but I'm also Tajik, I'm also Uzbek.\n\n1:56:28.340 --> 1:56:30.380\n I mean, it was a way of creating\n\n1:56:30.380 --> 1:56:33.540\n a multiethnic Afghan national identity\n\n1:56:33.540 --> 1:56:34.980\n that embraced everything.\n\n1:56:34.980 --> 1:56:37.860\n I mean, very utopian, you know, super utopian, right?\n\n1:56:37.860 --> 1:56:39.220\n But symbolically, it was very important\n\n1:56:39.220 --> 1:56:42.940\n that they rejected being mobilized politically,\n\n1:56:42.940 --> 1:56:45.340\n you know, voting as a Hazara or voting as whatever.\n\n1:56:45.340 --> 1:56:47.580\n And of course, there were communities who wanted to,\n\n1:56:47.580 --> 1:56:50.660\n you know, vote as that ethnic community.\n\n1:56:50.660 --> 1:56:52.220\n But there are also people who said, you know,\n\n1:56:52.220 --> 1:56:55.060\n let's put a kind of civic nationalism first,\n\n1:56:55.060 --> 1:56:57.740\n one that accommodates, I think, pluralism\n\n1:56:57.740 --> 1:57:00.180\n in a way that rejected the kind of majoritarian politics\n\n1:57:00.180 --> 1:57:03.380\n of one ethnic group dominating the thing.\n\n1:57:03.380 --> 1:57:04.580\n So all this stuff was quite interesting.\n\n1:57:04.580 --> 1:57:07.380\n I mean, women were asserting themselves\n\n1:57:07.380 --> 1:57:09.580\n across multiple spheres.\n\n1:57:09.580 --> 1:57:10.740\n Of course, it remained patriarchal.\n\n1:57:10.740 --> 1:57:11.580\n Of course, there were struggles.\n\n1:57:11.580 --> 1:57:12.420\n Of course, there was violence.\n\n1:57:12.420 --> 1:57:15.100\n Of course, you know, there's no utopia.\n\n1:57:15.100 --> 1:57:18.820\n But the door on all that shut on August 15.\n\n1:57:18.820 --> 1:57:22.020\n So to go back to the quote that I wanted to offer\n\n1:57:22.020 --> 1:57:25.620\n from the student, now professor,\n\n1:57:25.620 --> 1:57:28.540\n was it, you know, in trying to make sense of this,\n\n1:57:28.540 --> 1:57:31.780\n and you mentioned the tragic arc here,\n\n1:57:31.780 --> 1:57:35.060\n if you think of the 20 years, like, she asked, you know,\n\n1:57:35.060 --> 1:57:37.620\n why did you go to war in our country?\n\n1:57:37.620 --> 1:57:39.220\n Basically, why did you do this to us for 20 years\n\n1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:41.460\n when this was never about us?\n\n1:57:41.460 --> 1:57:43.860\n You know, you never asked us if you wanted to come.\n\n1:57:43.860 --> 1:57:46.420\n You never asked us what you wanted to build here.\n\n1:57:46.420 --> 1:57:47.460\n You didn't ask us when you were coming\n\n1:57:47.460 --> 1:57:49.420\n and you didn't ask us when you were leaving.\n\n1:57:49.420 --> 1:57:51.460\n You just did this all on your own.\n\n1:57:51.460 --> 1:57:53.780\n And we tried to make the most of it.\n\n1:57:53.780 --> 1:57:55.820\n And then you pulled the rug out from under us,\n\n1:57:55.820 --> 1:57:57.860\n you know, at the 11th hour,\n\n1:57:57.860 --> 1:58:02.100\n and returned to power, probably by diplomacy.\n\n1:58:02.100 --> 1:58:04.460\n It wasn't, at the end, just a military loss.\n\n1:58:04.460 --> 1:58:06.980\n I mean, it was a series of diplomatic decisions.\n\n1:58:06.980 --> 1:58:08.500\n I mean, the idea, you asked about alternatives.\n\n1:58:08.500 --> 1:58:10.900\n I mean, give me a Bagram.\n\n1:58:10.900 --> 1:58:12.740\n I mean, holding to the timeline.\n\n1:58:12.740 --> 1:58:14.260\n I mean, the Biden people did not need to hold\n\n1:58:14.260 --> 1:58:17.620\n to the Doha Agreement that Trump had signed.\n\n1:58:17.620 --> 1:58:19.820\n I mean, every American president\n\n1:58:19.820 --> 1:58:21.900\n writes his or her own foreign policy, right?\n\n1:58:21.900 --> 1:58:24.580\n So the Biden administration acted as if,\n\n1:58:24.580 --> 1:58:27.460\n and they tried to convince us that their hands were tied,\n\n1:58:28.460 --> 1:58:31.340\n and that it was either this or 20 more years of war\n\n1:58:31.340 --> 1:58:36.020\n or some absurd kind of, you know, false alternative.\n\n1:58:36.020 --> 1:58:37.980\n And so, but I think that's important\n\n1:58:37.980 --> 1:58:40.020\n for American audiences to hear that, you know,\n\n1:58:40.020 --> 1:58:42.180\n they're like, you came to here to experiment.\n\n1:58:42.180 --> 1:58:44.180\n You came here to punish.\n\n1:58:44.180 --> 1:58:47.820\n You came here to kind of reassert, you know,\n\n1:58:47.820 --> 1:58:49.860\n your dominance the world stage,\n\n1:58:49.860 --> 1:58:53.460\n you know, to work out the fear and hurt of 9 11\n\n1:58:53.460 --> 1:58:55.020\n that we talked about, which was so real, you know,\n\n1:58:55.020 --> 1:58:59.060\n impalpable and so important for American politics since then.\n\n1:58:59.060 --> 1:59:00.900\n Like you did, you worked out your problems,\n\n1:59:00.900 --> 1:59:02.820\n you know, on us, on our territory.\n\n1:59:03.940 --> 1:59:06.140\n And now what do we have for it?\n\n1:59:06.140 --> 1:59:08.820\n You know, and then the people who had a stake\n\n1:59:08.820 --> 1:59:12.180\n in that system, imperfect as it was,\n\n1:59:12.180 --> 1:59:13.700\n have been desperate to leave.\n\n1:59:13.700 --> 1:59:15.620\n And so this, I don't know how much people are aware of this,\n\n1:59:15.620 --> 1:59:19.300\n but, you know, I'm a scholar, I work in California,\n\n1:59:19.300 --> 1:59:23.380\n you know, I have friends, I edited a journal on Afghanistan\n\n1:59:23.380 --> 1:59:26.820\n and, you know, but I'm not a politician, I'm not a soldier,\n\n1:59:26.820 --> 1:59:28.780\n but people assume that, you know,\n\n1:59:28.780 --> 1:59:31.100\n Afghans have been desperately trying to reach me\n\n1:59:31.100 --> 1:59:34.700\n and anyone who is kind of on the radar as an American\n\n1:59:34.700 --> 1:59:36.020\n to help get them out.\n\n1:59:36.020 --> 1:59:39.420\n You know, that's the kind of like, you know,\n\n1:59:39.420 --> 1:59:42.260\n the symbol of voting with your feet, you know,\n\n1:59:42.260 --> 1:59:43.100\n is quite powerful.\n\n1:59:43.100 --> 1:59:45.900\n I mean, there's a huge swath of society\n\n1:59:45.900 --> 1:59:47.260\n that doesn't want the system\n\n1:59:47.260 --> 1:59:50.580\n and is literally living in terror about it.\n\n1:59:50.580 --> 1:59:51.420\n Naturally women, you know,\n\n1:59:51.420 --> 1:59:52.860\n I mean, especially women of a certain age,\n\n1:59:52.860 --> 1:59:54.780\n I mean, they feel like their lives are over.\n\n1:59:54.780 --> 1:59:56.820\n I mean, there is an epidemic of suicide.\n\n1:59:58.380 --> 2:00:02.380\n They feel betrayed and some people have done\n\n2:00:02.380 --> 2:00:03.540\n some good things in getting people out.\n\n2:00:03.540 --> 2:00:05.740\n You know, I mean, some, you know,\n\n2:00:05.740 --> 2:00:08.140\n the US military vets have been, you know,\n\n2:00:08.140 --> 2:00:10.980\n at the forefront of working to get out people,\n\n2:00:10.980 --> 2:00:14.500\n you know, that they know they owe,\n\n2:00:14.500 --> 2:00:17.580\n but the US government doesn't want these people.\n\n2:00:17.580 --> 2:00:19.660\n I mean, they have created all these obstacles\n\n2:00:19.660 --> 2:00:24.660\n to allowing a safety valve for people to leave.\n\n2:00:24.820 --> 2:00:27.820\n Looking forward from a perspective of leadership,\n\n2:00:27.820 --> 2:00:31.100\n how do we avoid these kinds of mistakes?\n\n2:00:31.100 --> 2:00:33.620\n So obviously some interests,\n\n2:00:33.620 --> 2:00:36.940\n some aspects of human nature led to this war.\n\n2:00:36.940 --> 2:00:41.060\n How do we resist that in the future?\n\n2:00:41.060 --> 2:00:44.540\n I guess beyond my moral and intellectual capacity,\n\n2:00:44.540 --> 2:00:45.620\n I'll just say this, I mean, looking at it,\n\n2:00:45.620 --> 2:00:47.980\n again, looking at it from my home ground as the university,\n\n2:00:47.980 --> 2:00:51.780\n and I think of the intellectual,\n\n2:00:53.100 --> 2:00:55.900\n you know, ways of thinking that I think students\n\n2:00:55.900 --> 2:00:59.060\n should develop for themselves as citizens, right?\n\n2:00:59.060 --> 2:01:01.940\n Maybe that's where to start is like historical thinking.\n\n2:01:01.940 --> 2:01:03.620\n I mean, these are all, you know,\n\n2:01:03.620 --> 2:01:04.900\n I try to tell people, you know,\n\n2:01:04.900 --> 2:01:07.460\n if you want to do robotics, computer science,\n\n2:01:07.460 --> 2:01:08.700\n you'd be a doctor or whatever.\n\n2:01:08.700 --> 2:01:10.100\n You should study history.\n\n2:01:10.100 --> 2:01:11.700\n Yeah, I mean, you don't have to be in a story like me,\n\n2:01:11.700 --> 2:01:13.300\n and it's, you know, my job isn't perfect.\n\n2:01:13.300 --> 2:01:15.100\n My profession is deeply flawed, right?\n\n2:01:15.100 --> 2:01:17.620\n But as I get older, I'm like,\n\n2:01:17.620 --> 2:01:18.460\n there are fewer and fewer historians\n\n2:01:18.460 --> 2:01:20.460\n that I actually like and want to hang out with and stuff.\n\n2:01:20.460 --> 2:01:22.220\n So it's like, I'm not offering myself\n\n2:01:22.220 --> 2:01:23.180\n as like a model for anything,\n\n2:01:23.180 --> 2:01:25.660\n but you know, whether you're a, you know,\n\n2:01:25.660 --> 2:01:27.820\n you carry the mail or you're a brain surgeon, whatever.\n\n2:01:27.820 --> 2:01:30.500\n I mean, I think it's a way of civic engagement\n\n2:01:30.500 --> 2:01:32.700\n and a way of like, you know, ethical being in the world\n\n2:01:32.700 --> 2:01:34.500\n that we need to familiarize ourselves with,\n\n2:01:34.500 --> 2:01:35.980\n because if you're an American\n\n2:01:35.980 --> 2:01:38.180\n or if you're from a rich country, you know,\n\n2:01:38.180 --> 2:01:40.260\n you need to be aware of your effect\n\n2:01:40.260 --> 2:01:42.260\n on an intricate world.\n\n2:01:42.260 --> 2:01:45.100\n You can't say anymore that you don't know or care\n\n2:01:45.100 --> 2:01:46.820\n what's happening in Afghanistan\n\n2:01:46.820 --> 2:01:49.580\n or really circle the globe and point to a place.\n\n2:01:49.580 --> 2:01:53.380\n I mean, we're all connected and we have ethical obligations.\n\n2:01:54.420 --> 2:01:55.940\n That's one place to start, but I would just say this,\n\n2:01:55.940 --> 2:01:57.540\n and this is a lot for a self critique,\n\n2:01:57.540 --> 2:02:01.180\n and that is so much of my teaching\n\n2:02:01.180 --> 2:02:03.020\n and like the themes of my research have been about empire,\n\n2:02:03.020 --> 2:02:05.460\n you know, how big states work,\n\n2:02:05.460 --> 2:02:07.500\n not only on big territories like the Russian Empire\n\n2:02:07.500 --> 2:02:08.340\n and Soviet Union and stuff,\n\n2:02:08.340 --> 2:02:11.860\n but the way in which power often is projected\n\n2:02:11.860 --> 2:02:14.140\n beyond those boundaries in ways that we don't see.\n\n2:02:14.140 --> 2:02:16.940\n So this is where things like neoliberalism\n\n2:02:16.940 --> 2:02:18.780\n or just, you know, if you want to take capitalism\n\n2:02:18.780 --> 2:02:21.860\n or just things that, you know, the idea of humanity\n\n2:02:21.860 --> 2:02:24.900\n or of liberalism or of humanitarianism,\n\n2:02:24.900 --> 2:02:26.900\n ideas that move beyond state boundaries\n\n2:02:26.900 --> 2:02:30.140\n are all things that we think about as affecting power\n\n2:02:30.140 --> 2:02:33.700\n in some ways that often harm people, right?\n\n2:02:33.700 --> 2:02:36.140\n So I think part of, as I've seen my job so far\n\n2:02:36.140 --> 2:02:37.620\n is to think about, you know,\n\n2:02:37.620 --> 2:02:39.940\n building upon the work of my people in grad school\n\n2:02:39.940 --> 2:02:42.140\n and, you know, scholars that have affected me.\n\n2:02:42.140 --> 2:02:43.820\n I mean, you know, we're all concerned\n\n2:02:43.820 --> 2:02:45.580\n with how power works and its effects\n\n2:02:45.580 --> 2:02:49.060\n and trying to be attuned to understanding\n\n2:02:50.020 --> 2:02:50.980\n things that aren't visible, right,\n\n2:02:50.980 --> 2:02:51.860\n that we should be thinking about,\n\n2:02:51.860 --> 2:02:52.940\n that should be known to us.\n\n2:02:52.940 --> 2:02:55.260\n And as scholars, we can hopefully play some useful role\n\n2:02:55.260 --> 2:03:00.260\n in showing effects that aren't, you know, obvious initially.\n\n2:03:01.620 --> 2:03:03.220\n So empire is a framework to think about this.\n\n2:03:03.220 --> 2:03:05.940\n And so you think about invading foreign countries.\n\n2:03:05.940 --> 2:03:07.980\n Obviously, if you're a scholar of empire,\n\n2:03:07.980 --> 2:03:09.580\n you've seen what that looks like,\n\n2:03:09.580 --> 2:03:11.620\n and that's horrific, right?\n\n2:03:11.620 --> 2:03:13.100\n You look at things like racism\n\n2:03:13.100 --> 2:03:16.780\n as one of the ideological pillars of empire.\n\n2:03:16.780 --> 2:03:17.620\n You know, that's horrific.\n\n2:03:17.620 --> 2:03:18.460\n It must be critiqued.\n\n2:03:18.460 --> 2:03:20.900\n It must be, you know, we must be educated against.\n\n2:03:22.100 --> 2:03:24.100\n Some of the, you know, gender exploitation of empire\n\n2:03:24.100 --> 2:03:25.420\n is also something to highlight, you know,\n\n2:03:25.420 --> 2:03:26.620\n to rectify and so on.\n\n2:03:27.820 --> 2:03:28.660\n You know, to be moral beings,\n\n2:03:28.660 --> 2:03:31.260\n we need to think about past inequality\n\n2:03:31.260 --> 2:03:35.220\n and the legacies of violence and destruction that live on.\n\n2:03:35.220 --> 2:03:36.340\n I mean, living in the Americas.\n\n2:03:36.340 --> 2:03:39.620\n I mean, look at, you know, we're all on stolen land.\n\n2:03:39.620 --> 2:03:43.020\n We're all in the sense living with the fruits of genocide\n\n2:03:43.020 --> 2:03:44.380\n and slavery and all those things\n\n2:03:44.380 --> 2:03:46.980\n that are hard to come to terms with, right?\n\n2:03:46.980 --> 2:03:49.740\n But the last few months in Afghanistan\n\n2:03:49.740 --> 2:03:53.380\n and thinking about empire, I think, made me more humble\n\n2:03:53.380 --> 2:03:57.100\n when I read people who say,\n\n2:03:57.100 --> 2:03:59.980\n to put it simply, have taken some joy in this moment,\n\n2:03:59.980 --> 2:04:02.020\n saying like, well, the Americans\n\n2:04:02.020 --> 2:04:03.940\n got kicked out of Afghanistan.\n\n2:04:03.940 --> 2:04:07.020\n You know, if you're against empire, this is a good thing.\n\n2:04:07.020 --> 2:04:09.620\n This is a kind of victory of anti colonial.\n\n2:04:10.780 --> 2:04:14.020\n You could see from the perspective of Afghanistan\n\n2:04:14.020 --> 2:04:16.940\n that America is not some kind of place\n\n2:04:16.940 --> 2:04:18.900\n that has an ideal of freedom\n\n2:04:18.900 --> 2:04:21.980\n and all the kind of things that we Americans tell ourselves,\n\n2:04:21.980 --> 2:04:25.820\n but it's more America has the ideal of empire,\n\n2:04:25.820 --> 2:04:28.420\n that there's one place that has the truth\n\n2:04:28.420 --> 2:04:31.700\n and everybody else must follow this truth.\n\n2:04:31.700 --> 2:04:34.340\n And so from a perspective of Afghanistan,\n\n2:04:34.340 --> 2:04:36.460\n it could be a victory against this idea\n\n2:04:36.460 --> 2:04:38.700\n of centralized truth of empire.\n\n2:04:39.780 --> 2:04:41.660\n That's another way to tell the story.\n\n2:04:41.660 --> 2:04:43.500\n And then in that sense, it's a victory.\n\n2:04:43.500 --> 2:04:46.580\n And in that sense also, I mean,\n\n2:04:46.580 --> 2:04:49.340\n you push back against this somewhat,\n\n2:04:49.340 --> 2:04:54.340\n this idea of Afghanistan as the graveyard of empires.\n\n2:04:54.620 --> 2:04:56.140\n Right, right.\n\n2:04:56.140 --> 2:04:59.980\n And outside this, I mean, I'm a critic of empire.\n\n2:04:59.980 --> 2:05:04.060\n I mean, you know, colonialism is a political phenomenon\n\n2:05:04.060 --> 2:05:05.060\n that stays with us.\n\n2:05:05.060 --> 2:05:06.900\n And I think, you know, we need scholars\n\n2:05:06.900 --> 2:05:08.900\n to point to the way in which it still works\n\n2:05:08.900 --> 2:05:10.060\n and still does harm.\n\n2:05:11.780 --> 2:05:12.820\n But it's part of being an empire\n\n2:05:12.820 --> 2:05:15.780\n that you can just get up and leave a place, right?\n\n2:05:15.780 --> 2:05:19.820\n That you can remake its politics on one day.\n\n2:05:19.820 --> 2:05:22.580\n And then because it fails to advance your agenda\n\n2:05:22.580 --> 2:05:26.180\n at one moment, you simply walk away.\n\n2:05:26.180 --> 2:05:27.860\n I mean, you know, we can point to other moments.\n\n2:05:27.860 --> 2:05:30.380\n I mean, 1947 on the subcontinent,\n\n2:05:30.380 --> 2:05:32.820\n you know, the way that the British withdrew\n\n2:05:34.500 --> 2:05:37.780\n played a significant role in mass violence,\n\n2:05:37.780 --> 2:05:40.100\n you know, that accompanied partition.\n\n2:05:40.100 --> 2:05:41.620\n It wasn't all the actions of the British\n\n2:05:41.620 --> 2:05:44.420\n that, you know, dictated that, right?\n\n2:05:44.420 --> 2:05:46.940\n There were lots of actors who chose to pick up,\n\n2:05:46.940 --> 2:05:49.860\n you know, the knife to kill their neighbor and so on.\n\n2:05:49.860 --> 2:05:52.020\n I mean, there's lots of agency in that moment\n\n2:05:52.020 --> 2:05:54.700\n as there is now in what's happening in Afghanistan.\n\n2:05:54.700 --> 2:05:56.980\n But I think the capriciousness,\n\n2:05:56.980 --> 2:06:01.980\n I mean, the ability to act as if your political decisions\n\n2:06:03.020 --> 2:06:06.340\n about other people's lives, you know,\n\n2:06:06.340 --> 2:06:09.580\n are something that can be made, you know, in secret.\n\n2:06:09.580 --> 2:06:11.820\n They can be made willy nilly.\n\n2:06:11.820 --> 2:06:14.580\n They really are beyond the accountability, you know,\n\n2:06:14.580 --> 2:06:17.020\n of those who are actually going to live\n\n2:06:17.020 --> 2:06:20.580\n with the consequences of shifting the cards on a deck\n\n2:06:20.580 --> 2:06:23.460\n in a way that decides who rules and who doesn't.\n\n2:06:23.460 --> 2:06:25.420\n I would love to hear your conversation\n\n2:06:25.420 --> 2:06:28.420\n with somebody I just talked to, which is Neil Ferguson,\n\n2:06:28.420 --> 2:06:30.980\n who argues on the topic of empire,\n\n2:06:30.980 --> 2:06:34.700\n that you can also zoom out even further\n\n2:06:34.700 --> 2:06:38.220\n and say, weigh the good and the bad of empire.\n\n2:06:38.220 --> 2:06:41.260\n And he argues, I think he gets a lot of flack for this\n\n2:06:41.260 --> 2:06:45.780\n from other historians, that like the British empire\n\n2:06:45.780 --> 2:06:50.420\n did more good than bad in certain moments of history.\n\n2:06:50.420 --> 2:06:52.860\n And that's an uncomfortable truth.\n\n2:06:52.860 --> 2:06:55.300\n There's like levels, it's a cake\n\n2:06:55.300 --> 2:06:57.860\n with layers of uncomfortable truths.\n\n2:06:57.860 --> 2:07:00.780\n And it's not a cake at all because none of it tastes good.\n\n2:07:00.780 --> 2:07:01.620\n Right.\n\n2:07:01.620 --> 2:07:04.180\n I mean, I would continue to disagree with Neil Ferguson.\n\n2:07:04.180 --> 2:07:06.460\n So I'm still working out where I am\n\n2:07:06.460 --> 2:07:08.820\n and what this moment does to kind of, I think,\n\n2:07:08.820 --> 2:07:12.380\n qualify my understanding of the past into,\n\n2:07:12.380 --> 2:07:15.460\n I think in a moment of humility, I do,\n\n2:07:15.460 --> 2:07:18.660\n and I'm probably reacting to the kind of, as you put it,\n\n2:07:18.660 --> 2:07:21.020\n I mean, the idea that this is like a good thing\n\n2:07:21.020 --> 2:07:23.140\n that American power has been defeated here.\n\n2:07:23.140 --> 2:07:25.780\n I mean, I do think American power should contract.\n\n2:07:25.780 --> 2:07:28.540\n And I don't think, and again,\n\n2:07:28.540 --> 2:07:30.660\n if I had to create a tally sheet\n\n2:07:30.660 --> 2:07:32.020\n of what the Americans did in the US,\n\n2:07:32.020 --> 2:07:35.460\n I mean, I mentioned the American University of Afghanistan.\n\n2:07:35.460 --> 2:07:37.660\n It could have done that without invading the country\n\n2:07:37.660 --> 2:07:38.900\n and killing people.\n\n2:07:38.900 --> 2:07:41.460\n I've not now become an apologist for empire.\n\n2:07:41.460 --> 2:07:44.460\n I'm not now a mini Neil Ferguson,\n\n2:07:44.460 --> 2:07:48.860\n but ending empire is, I mean,\n\n2:07:51.580 --> 2:07:54.180\n those decisions you make are in some ways\n\n2:07:54.180 --> 2:07:56.620\n a continuation of imperil hubris, right?\n\n2:07:57.900 --> 2:07:59.380\n So you're not really out of empire yet.\n\n2:07:59.380 --> 2:08:01.020\n You're not really contracting empire\n\n2:08:01.020 --> 2:08:03.500\n for those who are living it, you know?\n\n2:08:03.500 --> 2:08:05.580\n But I think it's also, I mean, maybe I put it this way,\n\n2:08:05.580 --> 2:08:08.300\n it's be careful what you ask for, you know?\n\n2:08:08.300 --> 2:08:10.980\n I mean, I wanted the US out of Afghanistan,\n\n2:08:12.380 --> 2:08:14.980\n but I wanted there to be a political settlement.\n\n2:08:14.980 --> 2:08:18.100\n I wanted my cake and I wanted to eat it too, right?\n\n2:08:18.100 --> 2:08:20.580\n I wanted all kinds of things to be different, right?\n\n2:08:20.580 --> 2:08:22.740\n But why is going to Afghanistan even needed for that?\n\n2:08:22.740 --> 2:08:26.260\n You can play all those games of geopolitics\n\n2:08:26.260 --> 2:08:30.140\n without ever invading and taking ownership of the place.\n\n2:08:30.140 --> 2:08:33.500\n It feels like the war, it feels like,\n\n2:08:33.500 --> 2:08:35.660\n I mean, I'm not exactly sure\n\n2:08:35.660 --> 2:08:38.420\n what military force is necessary for,\n\n2:08:38.420 --> 2:08:41.820\n except for targeted intense attacks.\n\n2:08:41.820 --> 2:08:46.500\n It feels like to me, the right thing to do after 9 11\n\n2:08:46.500 --> 2:08:49.940\n was to show what was a display of force\n\n2:08:49.940 --> 2:08:52.040\n unlike anything the world has ever seen\n\n2:08:52.040 --> 2:08:54.180\n for a very short amount of time.\n\n2:08:54.180 --> 2:08:57.220\n Targeted at, sure, a terrorist,\n\n2:08:57.220 --> 2:08:59.860\n at certain strongholds and so on.\n\n2:08:59.860 --> 2:09:03.500\n And then in and out and then focus on education,\n\n2:09:03.500 --> 2:09:08.500\n on empowering women into the education system,\n\n2:09:08.980 --> 2:09:10.740\n all those kinds of things that have to do\n\n2:09:10.740 --> 2:09:13.980\n with supporting the culture, the education,\n\n2:09:13.980 --> 2:09:16.420\n the flourishing of the place.\n\n2:09:16.420 --> 2:09:21.260\n It has nothing to do with military policing essentially.\n\n2:09:21.260 --> 2:09:22.100\n Right.\n\n2:09:22.100 --> 2:09:25.100\n I mean, I think, yeah, if you look at it through that lens,\n\n2:09:25.100 --> 2:09:28.100\n I mean, if any Afghanistan and then if any Iraq\n\n2:09:28.100 --> 2:09:33.100\n didn't end Al Qaeda, it didn't end terrorism, right?\n\n2:09:33.300 --> 2:09:38.260\n It didn't really deflate these ideologies entirely.\n\n2:09:38.260 --> 2:09:40.860\n There were, if you like, you could say there were,\n\n2:09:41.900 --> 2:09:46.900\n some limited discrediting of certain kinds of ideas.\n\n2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:48.040\n But in fact, I mean,\n\n2:09:48.040 --> 2:09:50.620\n look at the phenomenon of suicide bombing.\n\n2:09:50.620 --> 2:09:51.700\n I mean, it spread.\n\n2:09:51.700 --> 2:09:53.780\n I mean, it was never an Islamic thing.\n\n2:09:53.780 --> 2:09:55.420\n It was never a Muslim thing.\n\n2:09:55.420 --> 2:09:58.100\n Some Muslims adopted it in some places,\n\n2:09:58.100 --> 2:10:00.340\n but the circuits of knowledge\n\n2:10:00.340 --> 2:10:02.740\n about how to do these kinds of things only expanded\n\n2:10:02.740 --> 2:10:05.700\n with the insurgencies that emerged in Afghanistan and Iraq,\n\n2:10:05.700 --> 2:10:06.860\n and then they kind of became connected.\n\n2:10:06.860 --> 2:10:08.380\n And then they began to the present.\n\n2:10:08.380 --> 2:10:10.220\n I mean, the Islamic state is,\n\n2:10:10.220 --> 2:10:12.580\n it's the best thing that happened to the Taliban ever\n\n2:10:12.580 --> 2:10:17.100\n because it's on the basis of its supposed new stance\n\n2:10:18.420 --> 2:10:20.080\n as a counterterrorism outfit\n\n2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:22.460\n that it will get recognition from all its neighbors.\n\n2:10:22.460 --> 2:10:24.380\n It will get recognition from Russia.\n\n2:10:24.380 --> 2:10:26.900\n I mean, already with the evacuation of the airport,\n\n2:10:26.900 --> 2:10:29.340\n the United States was collaborating with the Taliban\n\n2:10:29.340 --> 2:10:31.300\n against the Islamic state\n\n2:10:31.300 --> 2:10:34.140\n and openly talking about the Taliban\n\n2:10:34.140 --> 2:10:35.780\n as if they were partners in the security operation.\n\n2:10:35.780 --> 2:10:40.000\n So, and then Al Qaeda remains present in Afghanistan, so.\n\n2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:42.260\n Trillions of dollars spent.\n\n2:10:42.260 --> 2:10:43.860\n Yeah.\n\n2:10:43.860 --> 2:10:48.520\n The drones up above bombing places\n\n2:10:48.520 --> 2:10:50.140\n that result in civilian death,\n\n2:10:50.140 --> 2:10:53.220\n the death of children, the death of fathers and mothers,\n\n2:10:53.220 --> 2:10:56.060\n and those stories even at the individual level\n\n2:10:56.060 --> 2:10:58.940\n propagate virally across the land,\n\n2:10:58.940 --> 2:11:01.700\n creating potentially more terrorists.\n\n2:11:01.700 --> 2:11:04.920\n And a cynical view of the trillions of dollars\n\n2:11:04.920 --> 2:11:08.460\n is the military industrial complex\n\n2:11:08.460 --> 2:11:13.460\n where there's just a momentum where after 9 11,\n\n2:11:13.460 --> 2:11:16.240\n the feeling like we should do something\n\n2:11:16.240 --> 2:11:18.740\n led to us doing something.\n\n2:11:18.740 --> 2:11:21.580\n And then a lot of people realizing they can make money\n\n2:11:21.580 --> 2:11:23.500\n from doing more of that something.\n\n2:11:23.500 --> 2:11:25.380\n And then it's just the momentum\n\n2:11:25.380 --> 2:11:28.620\n where no one person is sitting there\n\n2:11:28.620 --> 2:11:30.900\n petting a cat in an evil way,\n\n2:11:30.900 --> 2:11:33.220\n saying we're going to spend all of this money\n\n2:11:33.220 --> 2:11:36.260\n and create more suffering and create more terrorism.\n\n2:11:36.260 --> 2:11:37.860\n But it's just something about that momentum\n\n2:11:37.860 --> 2:11:39.140\n that leads to that.\n\n2:11:39.140 --> 2:11:42.540\n And to me, honestly, I'm still a sucker.\n\n2:11:42.540 --> 2:11:43.940\n I believe in leadership.\n\n2:11:43.940 --> 2:11:47.540\n I believe in great charismatic leaders\n\n2:11:47.540 --> 2:11:51.460\n and the power of that want to do evil and to do good.\n\n2:11:51.460 --> 2:11:56.460\n And it felt like I honestly put the blame on George Bush,\n\n2:11:58.620 --> 2:12:03.020\n Obama, Trump, and Biden for lack of leadership.\n\n2:12:03.020 --> 2:12:05.060\n Yeah, definitely, definitely.\n\n2:12:05.060 --> 2:12:05.900\n I agree.\n\n2:12:05.900 --> 2:12:08.020\n Yeah, there is the military industrial complex component,\n\n2:12:08.020 --> 2:12:09.360\n which is huge.\n\n2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:11.300\n And there's also, I mean, speaking of government leadership,\n\n2:12:11.300 --> 2:12:15.020\n it's also, I'd say the imbalance of power within Washington.\n\n2:12:15.020 --> 2:12:18.700\n I mean, the Pentagon used this moment,\n\n2:12:20.160 --> 2:12:21.260\n well, beginning in 2001,\n\n2:12:21.260 --> 2:12:24.620\n I think to assert this authority\n\n2:12:24.620 --> 2:12:26.300\n at the expense of other institutions\n\n2:12:26.300 --> 2:12:27.940\n of national government.\n\n2:12:27.940 --> 2:12:30.300\n I mean, the State Department diplomacy\n\n2:12:31.780 --> 2:12:35.820\n has become a shadow of what it was once capable of doing.\n\n2:12:35.820 --> 2:12:37.980\n And of course, I mean, other historians, US historians,\n\n2:12:37.980 --> 2:12:39.620\n which I'm not formally a historian of the United States,\n\n2:12:39.620 --> 2:12:42.040\n but we can go back to talk about Vietnam.\n\n2:12:42.040 --> 2:12:46.200\n We talk about lots of Cold War and post Cold War engagements.\n\n2:12:47.380 --> 2:12:49.000\n And I think we need a reckoning\n\n2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:52.580\n about how the United States uses military power,\n\n2:12:52.580 --> 2:12:55.220\n why we devote so much to our military budget\n\n2:12:55.220 --> 2:12:56.780\n and what could be available to us\n\n2:12:56.780 --> 2:12:59.940\n if we had a more sensible view\n\n2:12:59.940 --> 2:13:03.060\n of the value of military power, of its effectiveness.\n\n2:13:03.060 --> 2:13:04.900\n And I think we're willing to hammer home\n\n2:13:04.900 --> 2:13:05.900\n that this was a defeat.\n\n2:13:05.900 --> 2:13:08.020\n I mean, I think there should be accountability.\n\n2:13:08.020 --> 2:13:09.780\n And this could be a kind of opening\n\n2:13:09.780 --> 2:13:11.220\n for a kind of bipartisan conversation,\n\n2:13:11.220 --> 2:13:16.220\n because if you are a kind of American militarist,\n\n2:13:16.460 --> 2:13:18.440\n I mean, you have to look at the leadership\n\n2:13:18.440 --> 2:13:20.660\n that got you to a place where you were defeated\n\n2:13:20.660 --> 2:13:25.660\n by men wearing sandals firing AK 47s, right?\n\n2:13:25.980 --> 2:13:27.980\n Yeah, there should be a humility with that.\n\n2:13:29.480 --> 2:13:31.820\n I mean, we should actually say that,\n\n2:13:31.820 --> 2:13:34.200\n like literally the...\n\n2:13:34.200 --> 2:13:35.040\n Oh, we lost.\n\n2:13:35.040 --> 2:13:35.880\n You should say we lost.\n\n2:13:35.880 --> 2:13:37.580\n It wasn't just, you know...\n\n2:13:37.580 --> 2:13:40.700\n The American military lost.\n\n2:13:40.700 --> 2:13:43.620\n Yeah, and I feel I have very mixed feelings\n\n2:13:43.620 --> 2:13:46.340\n and it's, I don't know, a ton of veterans,\n\n2:13:46.340 --> 2:13:48.160\n but Mitch and I have topped my share\n\n2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:52.380\n and have a student now and they're suffering\n\n2:13:52.380 --> 2:13:54.260\n because they look at the sacrifices that they made\n\n2:13:54.260 --> 2:13:55.260\n that I didn't make.\n\n2:13:55.260 --> 2:13:57.060\n I mean, American society didn't make the sacrifices.\n\n2:13:57.060 --> 2:13:59.420\n I mean, men and women lost limbs,\n\n2:13:59.420 --> 2:14:01.220\n they lost eyes, they lost lives.\n\n2:14:02.900 --> 2:14:06.140\n There's been this, of course, quiet epidemic of suicide\n\n2:14:06.140 --> 2:14:07.980\n among veterans.\n\n2:14:07.980 --> 2:14:10.860\n And I've heard some stories\n\n2:14:10.860 --> 2:14:12.300\n the fact that the State Department\n\n2:14:12.300 --> 2:14:14.760\n is seeing a similar surge of suicides\n\n2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:19.760\n because they see their adult life's work collapse.\n\n2:14:19.820 --> 2:14:20.740\n They've seen their relationships.\n\n2:14:20.740 --> 2:14:23.500\n I mean, they've seen phone calls in the middle of the night\n\n2:14:23.500 --> 2:14:26.460\n from people who they entrusted with their lives\n\n2:14:26.460 --> 2:14:28.340\n who they know are gonna be targeted.\n\n2:14:28.340 --> 2:14:30.820\n I mean, some of them have already been killed.\n\n2:14:30.820 --> 2:14:32.780\n They've seen the, I mean, I think just,\n\n2:14:32.780 --> 2:14:35.620\n I'd imagine just ideologically and professionally\n\n2:14:35.620 --> 2:14:40.060\n what they believed in and what they sacrificed for\n\n2:14:40.060 --> 2:14:41.780\n has vanished.\n\n2:14:41.780 --> 2:14:44.700\n And I think that's bad.\n\n2:14:44.700 --> 2:14:46.740\n I mean, historically thinking of some of the precedents\n\n2:14:46.740 --> 2:14:49.580\n you were thinking of, I mean, if you think of,\n\n2:14:49.580 --> 2:14:51.300\n first of all, at a human level,\n\n2:14:51.300 --> 2:14:53.220\n I feel horrible for those people who,\n\n2:14:53.220 --> 2:14:55.500\n I may not have agreed with everything they had done\n\n2:14:55.500 --> 2:14:56.620\n and their choices in life,\n\n2:14:56.620 --> 2:14:59.260\n but I respect the fact that many good people\n\n2:14:59.260 --> 2:15:03.540\n went out of the best intentions as young people\n\n2:15:03.540 --> 2:15:05.900\n to do the right thing and make things right.\n\n2:15:05.900 --> 2:15:07.180\n And I respect that.\n\n2:15:07.180 --> 2:15:09.980\n And I've met enough to know that there were people\n\n2:15:09.980 --> 2:15:12.180\n who saw the gray and complexity\n\n2:15:12.180 --> 2:15:14.440\n and that's all you can hope for.\n\n2:15:16.340 --> 2:15:19.220\n But we don't want a generation of disillusioned veterans\n\n2:15:20.900 --> 2:15:23.460\n if we look at the other postwar moments.\n\n2:15:23.460 --> 2:15:25.940\n And this is kind of a postwar moment where,\n\n2:15:25.940 --> 2:15:27.740\n I think we need a conversation with American veterans\n\n2:15:27.740 --> 2:15:31.040\n about what they've gone through and what they're feeling.\n\n2:15:31.040 --> 2:15:33.100\n And they still have skin in the game\n\n2:15:33.100 --> 2:15:33.940\n because their personal connections\n\n2:15:33.940 --> 2:15:35.460\n and the end of their histories.\n\n2:15:35.460 --> 2:15:37.260\n And they're also gonna be future leaders.\n\n2:15:37.260 --> 2:15:39.380\n I mean, veterans.\n\n2:15:39.380 --> 2:15:43.940\n People who have served are often great men and women.\n\n2:15:43.940 --> 2:15:45.080\n That's true.\n\n2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:50.080\n And throughout history,\n\n2:15:50.080 --> 2:15:54.500\n whether you sacrifice you served in fighting World War II,\n\n2:15:54.500 --> 2:15:55.940\n in fighting Vietnam,\n\n2:15:55.940 --> 2:15:58.780\n that's going to mold you in different ways.\n\n2:15:58.780 --> 2:16:02.620\n That's going to mold how you are as a leader\n\n2:16:02.620 --> 2:16:04.740\n that leads this country forward.\n\n2:16:04.740 --> 2:16:07.200\n And so you have to have an honest conversation\n\n2:16:07.200 --> 2:16:12.200\n about what was the role of the war in Afghanistan,\n\n2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:15.000\n the war in the Middle East,\n\n2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:18.060\n the war on terror in the history of America.\n\n2:16:18.060 --> 2:16:20.100\n If we just look at the full context\n\n2:16:20.100 --> 2:16:22.340\n at the end of this 21st century,\n\n2:16:22.340 --> 2:16:24.420\n how are we going to remember this\n\n2:16:24.420 --> 2:16:27.800\n and how that's going to result in our future interactions\n\n2:16:27.800 --> 2:16:30.560\n with small and large countries,\n\n2:16:30.560 --> 2:16:32.860\n with China or some proxy war with China,\n\n2:16:32.860 --> 2:16:36.420\n with Russia or some proxy war with Russia\n\n2:16:36.420 --> 2:16:39.180\n what's the role of oil and natural resources and opium\n\n2:16:39.180 --> 2:16:40.620\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n2:16:40.620 --> 2:16:45.220\n What's the role of military power in the world.\n\n2:16:45.220 --> 2:16:46.580\n And now with COVID,\n\n2:16:50.220 --> 2:16:55.220\n it's almost like because of the many failures\n\n2:16:55.220 --> 2:16:58.820\n of the US government and many leaders\n\n2:17:00.860 --> 2:17:04.700\n in science and politics to respond effectively\n\n2:17:04.700 --> 2:17:07.820\n and quickly to COVID,\n\n2:17:07.820 --> 2:17:12.340\n we kind of forget that we fumbled this other thing too.\n\n2:17:12.340 --> 2:17:15.340\n And it's hard to know which is going to be more expensive.\n\n2:17:17.340 --> 2:17:19.620\n They seem to be symptoms of something\n\n2:17:21.820 --> 2:17:26.820\n of a same kind of source problem of leadership,\n\n2:17:28.140 --> 2:17:31.740\n of bureaucracy, of the way information\n\n2:17:31.740 --> 2:17:34.500\n and intelligence flows throughout the US government.\n\n2:17:34.500 --> 2:17:35.660\n All those kinds of things.\n\n2:17:35.660 --> 2:17:39.340\n And that hopefully motivates young leaders to fix things.\n\n2:17:39.340 --> 2:17:41.140\n Definitely, I mean, if there's one theme\n\n2:17:41.140 --> 2:17:43.060\n that jumps out to me and thinking about this moment,\n\n2:17:43.060 --> 2:17:45.100\n I mean, if we recognize that we live\n\n2:17:45.100 --> 2:17:48.540\n in a kind of crisis of democracy in the United States\n\n2:17:48.540 --> 2:17:50.900\n and in other countries that have long been proud\n\n2:17:50.900 --> 2:17:51.820\n of their democratic traditions,\n\n2:17:51.820 --> 2:17:54.220\n if we see them being under assault from certain quarters,\n\n2:17:54.220 --> 2:17:57.700\n I think military defeat is yet another addition\n\n2:17:57.700 --> 2:18:00.020\n to all the aspects of this that you mentioned.\n\n2:18:00.020 --> 2:18:04.020\n I mean, the fact that military defeat is a giant match\n\n2:18:04.020 --> 2:18:05.580\n that you're throwing on this fire potentially,\n\n2:18:05.580 --> 2:18:07.780\n if we think of its legacies\n\n2:18:07.780 --> 2:18:09.100\n and other postwar environments,\n\n2:18:09.100 --> 2:18:12.700\n when the veteran angle is one,\n\n2:18:12.700 --> 2:18:15.500\n when you have people who feel betrayed,\n\n2:18:15.500 --> 2:18:17.060\n I mean, they have been fodder\n\n2:18:17.060 --> 2:18:18.580\n for the far right in other settings.\n\n2:18:18.580 --> 2:18:19.820\n I mean, interwar Europe is very much\n\n2:18:19.820 --> 2:18:23.020\n about mobilizing dissolution veterans\n\n2:18:23.020 --> 2:18:25.260\n in the name of right wing fascist politics.\n\n2:18:26.580 --> 2:18:28.940\n If one thinks too of this moment\n\n2:18:28.940 --> 2:18:32.060\n of really increasing xenophobia,\n\n2:18:32.060 --> 2:18:34.580\n our immigration debate is now talking about\n\n2:18:34.580 --> 2:18:36.420\n whether or not Afghans should be permitted at all\n\n2:18:36.420 --> 2:18:39.020\n in the United States after 20 years.\n\n2:18:39.020 --> 2:18:41.540\n And I think immediately the response in Europe,\n\n2:18:41.540 --> 2:18:44.300\n which I followed to some extent, focusing on Germany,\n\n2:18:45.220 --> 2:18:49.100\n because it was really ramping up deportations of Afghans\n\n2:18:49.100 --> 2:18:50.820\n leading up to this collapse.\n\n2:18:50.820 --> 2:18:52.140\n And now they have been,\n\n2:18:53.540 --> 2:18:57.100\n a lot of right wing center right politicians in Germany\n\n2:18:57.100 --> 2:19:01.220\n have been watching all this with an eye to,\n\n2:19:01.220 --> 2:19:05.220\n using it to their advantage for a domestic German audience\n\n2:19:05.220 --> 2:19:07.660\n to say, in the context of recent elections,\n\n2:19:07.660 --> 2:19:09.820\n that we are the party who will defend you\n\n2:19:09.820 --> 2:19:11.460\n against these Afghans who are gonna be coming from this.\n\n2:19:11.460 --> 2:19:13.380\n So what I've tried to emphasize\n\n2:19:13.380 --> 2:19:15.180\n in talking to different groups about this moment\n\n2:19:15.180 --> 2:19:17.700\n is that it won't be confined to Afghanistan\n\n2:19:17.700 --> 2:19:18.540\n or even the region.\n\n2:19:18.540 --> 2:19:20.700\n I mean, obviously malnutrition, hunger\n\n2:19:20.700 --> 2:19:23.140\n will send Afghans to neighboring states,\n\n2:19:23.140 --> 2:19:27.180\n but where the European right is resurgent,\n\n2:19:27.180 --> 2:19:28.620\n this has been a gift, right?\n\n2:19:28.620 --> 2:19:30.700\n To say that the Afghans are coming,\n\n2:19:30.700 --> 2:19:32.460\n they're brown skinned, they're Muslim,\n\n2:19:32.460 --> 2:19:34.980\n they're uneducated, they're gonna want your women.\n\n2:19:34.980 --> 2:19:37.900\n And they will take the odd sexual assault case\n\n2:19:37.900 --> 2:19:41.460\n or the odd, whatever, dramatic act of violence\n\n2:19:41.460 --> 2:19:45.380\n that happens numerically in any population.\n\n2:19:45.380 --> 2:19:47.380\n And they will magnify that to say that,\n\n2:19:49.020 --> 2:19:51.740\n our far right group is gonna save the nation.\n\n2:19:51.740 --> 2:19:54.620\n And sorry, the main point I wanted to speak of leadership\n\n2:19:54.620 --> 2:19:56.740\n was that I think the serial,\n\n2:19:56.740 --> 2:20:00.180\n well, there were many, many carnal sins, if you like,\n\n2:20:00.180 --> 2:20:02.580\n but if you go back to our analogy of all the exits,\n\n2:20:02.580 --> 2:20:04.740\n I mean, what blocked some of those exits\n\n2:20:04.740 --> 2:20:09.660\n was an absence of truth and transparency and the lying.\n\n2:20:09.660 --> 2:20:11.620\n And so, I mean, this is no secret,\n\n2:20:11.620 --> 2:20:15.140\n anyone who's followed this, but we've allowed,\n\n2:20:15.140 --> 2:20:17.460\n and you think of the general mistrust of government,\n\n2:20:17.460 --> 2:20:21.820\n mistrust of authority across the board,\n\n2:20:21.820 --> 2:20:26.740\n of professors, of economists, of scientists, doctors, right?\n\n2:20:26.740 --> 2:20:28.900\n Well, I actually think that's the hopeful thing to me\n\n2:20:28.900 --> 2:20:33.900\n about the internet is the internet hates inauthenticity.\n\n2:20:34.140 --> 2:20:36.180\n They can smell bullshit much better.\n\n2:20:36.180 --> 2:20:38.300\n And I think that motivates young leaders\n\n2:20:38.300 --> 2:20:40.580\n to be transparent and authentic.\n\n2:20:40.580 --> 2:20:45.260\n So like the very problems we've been seeing,\n\n2:20:45.260 --> 2:20:49.180\n this kind of attitude of authority where,\n\n2:20:49.180 --> 2:20:53.220\n oh, the populace, they're too busy with their own lives.\n\n2:20:53.220 --> 2:20:54.900\n They're not smart enough to understand\n\n2:20:54.900 --> 2:20:57.580\n the full complexities of the things we're dealing with.\n\n2:20:57.580 --> 2:20:59.820\n So we're not going to even communicate to them\n\n2:20:59.820 --> 2:21:02.860\n the full complexities, we're just going to decide\n\n2:21:02.860 --> 2:21:05.300\n and then tell them what we decided\n\n2:21:05.300 --> 2:21:08.100\n and conceive some kind of narrative\n\n2:21:08.100 --> 2:21:12.340\n that makes it easy for them to consume this decision.\n\n2:21:13.500 --> 2:21:16.620\n As opposed to that, I really believe,\n\n2:21:16.620 --> 2:21:18.820\n I see there's a hunger for authenticity\n\n2:21:18.820 --> 2:21:21.780\n of when you're making decisions,\n\n2:21:21.780 --> 2:21:23.780\n when you're looking at the rest of the world\n\n2:21:23.780 --> 2:21:28.780\n and trying to untangle this complexity, the internet,\n\n2:21:28.980 --> 2:21:33.220\n the public, the world wants to see you as a leader struggle\n\n2:21:33.220 --> 2:21:37.700\n with the tension of these ideas, to change your mind,\n\n2:21:37.700 --> 2:21:40.380\n to recognize your own flaws\n\n2:21:40.380 --> 2:21:43.060\n and your own thinking from a month ago, all that,\n\n2:21:43.060 --> 2:21:44.300\n the full complexity of it,\n\n2:21:44.300 --> 2:21:47.660\n also acknowledge the uncertainty as with COVID,\n\n2:21:47.660 --> 2:21:51.820\n also with the wars, I think there's a hunger for that.\n\n2:21:51.820 --> 2:21:53.860\n And I think that's just going to change the nature\n\n2:21:53.860 --> 2:21:56.340\n of leadership in the 21st century.\n\n2:21:56.340 --> 2:21:57.180\n I hope so.\n\n2:21:57.180 --> 2:21:59.780\n I think all the things you've highlighted,\n\n2:21:59.780 --> 2:22:00.900\n accountability is part of that, right?\n\n2:22:00.900 --> 2:22:04.740\n I mean, we need honesty, openness,\n\n2:22:04.740 --> 2:22:06.820\n and then acknowledgement of mistakes.\n\n2:22:06.820 --> 2:22:08.900\n Humility is the key to all learning, right?\n\n2:22:08.900 --> 2:22:10.860\n But also, I mean, you think just the headline\n\n2:22:10.860 --> 2:22:14.660\n from yesterday, the horrible drone strike,\n\n2:22:14.660 --> 2:22:18.180\n which was really the last kind of American military action\n\n2:22:18.180 --> 2:22:20.460\n on the day that the US was, I think,\n\n2:22:20.460 --> 2:22:22.660\n mostly departing from Kabul,\n\n2:22:22.660 --> 2:22:25.500\n wiped out an entire family, mostly children.\n\n2:22:25.500 --> 2:22:27.020\n You know, the US acknowledged that, yes,\n\n2:22:27.020 --> 2:22:29.540\n this was not the ISIS bombing outfit\n\n2:22:29.540 --> 2:22:31.300\n that they thought it was.\n\n2:22:31.300 --> 2:22:33.660\n But yesterday, they did a quick review.\n\n2:22:34.860 --> 2:22:36.940\n I'm not an expert on drone strikes in the aftermath,\n\n2:22:36.940 --> 2:22:38.940\n but those who've looked at it more closely said\n\n2:22:38.940 --> 2:22:41.860\n it was basically whole cloth taken\n\n2:22:41.860 --> 2:22:44.900\n from what the US government has been saying\n\n2:22:44.900 --> 2:22:46.980\n after all these strikes, you know,\n\n2:22:46.980 --> 2:22:48.100\n reproducing the same language\n\n2:22:48.100 --> 2:22:51.740\n and basically pointing to technical errors,\n\n2:22:51.740 --> 2:22:56.740\n but denying that there were any procedural mistakes\n\n2:22:57.420 --> 2:22:59.780\n or flaws, or it was just kind of,\n\n2:22:59.780 --> 2:23:01.580\n they found little ways of acknowledging\n\n2:23:01.580 --> 2:23:02.660\n things did not go as planned,\n\n2:23:02.660 --> 2:23:06.340\n but, you know, we follow the policies essentially,\n\n2:23:06.340 --> 2:23:08.060\n and yeah, that's it.\n\n2:23:08.060 --> 2:23:09.700\n It's not a crime.\n\n2:23:09.700 --> 2:23:13.700\n It's a way of not even saying, you know, we screwed up.\n\n2:23:13.700 --> 2:23:15.620\n And it's kind of the legal ease\n\n2:23:15.620 --> 2:23:19.700\n that suddenly makes a war crime not a war crime, you know?\n\n2:23:19.700 --> 2:23:22.420\n And that reflects, I think,\n\n2:23:22.420 --> 2:23:24.660\n our refusal to take accountability.\n\n2:23:24.660 --> 2:23:26.660\n I think people are really sick of that\n\n2:23:26.660 --> 2:23:29.580\n in a way where the opposite is true,\n\n2:23:29.580 --> 2:23:33.660\n which is they get excited for people who are not,\n\n2:23:33.660 --> 2:23:35.540\n for leaders who are not that,\n\n2:23:35.540 --> 2:23:37.660\n and so they're not going to punish you\n\n2:23:37.660 --> 2:23:40.260\n for saying, I made a mistake.\n\n2:23:42.740 --> 2:23:44.740\n I just had a conversation with Francis Collins,\n\n2:23:44.740 --> 2:23:46.180\n the director of the NIH,\n\n2:23:46.180 --> 2:23:49.300\n and part of my criticism towards Anthony Fauci\n\n2:23:49.300 --> 2:23:54.180\n has been that it's such subtle,\n\n2:23:54.180 --> 2:23:58.900\n but such crucial communication of mistakes made.\n\n2:23:58.900 --> 2:24:00.540\n If you make a small mistake,\n\n2:24:00.540 --> 2:24:04.100\n it is so powerful to communicate,\n\n2:24:04.100 --> 2:24:05.500\n I think we messed up.\n\n2:24:05.500 --> 2:24:08.620\n We thought this was true, and it wasn't.\n\n2:24:08.620 --> 2:24:11.220\n So the obvious thing there was with masks\n\n2:24:11.220 --> 2:24:13.220\n early in the pandemic.\n\n2:24:13.220 --> 2:24:14.620\n There's so much uncertainty.\n\n2:24:14.620 --> 2:24:17.020\n It's so understandable to make mistakes\n\n2:24:17.020 --> 2:24:21.140\n or to also be concerned about what kind of hysteria,\n\n2:24:21.140 --> 2:24:23.420\n different statements you make lead to.\n\n2:24:23.420 --> 2:24:25.020\n Just being transparent about that\n\n2:24:25.020 --> 2:24:26.820\n and saying we were not correct\n\n2:24:26.820 --> 2:24:28.100\n and saying the thing we said before.\n\n2:24:28.100 --> 2:24:33.100\n That's so powerful to communicate, to gain trust.\n\n2:24:33.340 --> 2:24:35.180\n And the opposite is true.\n\n2:24:35.180 --> 2:24:38.580\n When you do this legal ease type of talk,\n\n2:24:38.580 --> 2:24:40.780\n it destroys trust.\n\n2:24:40.780 --> 2:24:45.780\n And again, I really think the lessons of recent history\n\n2:24:47.180 --> 2:24:51.060\n teach us how to be a leader\n\n2:24:51.060 --> 2:24:53.580\n and teach young leaders how to be leaders.\n\n2:24:53.580 --> 2:24:56.740\n And so I have a lot of hope.\n\n2:24:56.740 --> 2:24:58.580\n Partially thanks for the internet.\n\n2:24:58.580 --> 2:25:00.140\n Yeah, yeah, that's great.\n\n2:25:00.140 --> 2:25:00.980\n Oh, humility.\n\n2:25:00.980 --> 2:25:03.580\n I mean, we need humility, accountability, honesty.\n\n2:25:05.340 --> 2:25:07.660\n And yes, studying the past is an important way to do that.\n\n2:25:07.660 --> 2:25:09.700\n I mean, to learn from past mistakes.\n\n2:25:09.700 --> 2:25:11.900\n And obviously there's stories of inspiration and courage\n\n2:25:11.900 --> 2:25:14.700\n and we can take some kind of assistance from that too.\n\n2:25:14.700 --> 2:25:19.100\n But also learning from, learning how not to do things.\n\n2:25:19.100 --> 2:25:23.140\n And then analogies are never like one to one.\n\n2:25:23.140 --> 2:25:24.260\n I mean, we talk about Vietnam.\n\n2:25:24.260 --> 2:25:27.100\n I mean, I think many Vietnam veterans would say,\n\n2:25:27.100 --> 2:25:28.500\n yeah, this is like deja vu.\n\n2:25:28.500 --> 2:25:31.700\n I mean, the story, the visuals of the Kabul airport\n\n2:25:31.700 --> 2:25:35.580\n and of the Saigon embassy were not the same,\n\n2:25:35.580 --> 2:25:38.220\n but close enough that people would juxtapose them.\n\n2:25:38.220 --> 2:25:39.620\n All of this right now, but I would just ask people\n\n2:25:39.620 --> 2:25:44.620\n that over analogizing is also a kind of path down\n\n2:25:44.780 --> 2:25:47.900\n making errors of judgment and comparison,\n\n2:25:47.900 --> 2:25:51.260\n and then sameness, but it's stretch.\n\n2:25:51.260 --> 2:25:52.380\n I mean, like 9.11 itself,\n\n2:25:52.380 --> 2:25:56.580\n I think the idea that people lack the imagination\n\n2:25:56.580 --> 2:25:58.100\n within our security apparatus\n\n2:25:58.100 --> 2:26:00.540\n to think this was even possible, right?\n\n2:26:00.540 --> 2:26:03.380\n And you think of the simplicity of having a $10 lock\n\n2:26:03.380 --> 2:26:06.380\n on a cockpit door, could have wanted all this.\n\n2:26:06.380 --> 2:26:09.500\n And again, I'm not saying either the time\n\n2:26:09.500 --> 2:26:11.780\n or in hindsight that I am omniscient about all this,\n\n2:26:11.780 --> 2:26:15.100\n but I had just been living in Germany the year before,\n\n2:26:15.100 --> 2:26:16.980\n and there was a plot there.\n\n2:26:16.980 --> 2:26:18.780\n This guy was hatching from Germany\n\n2:26:18.780 --> 2:26:22.220\n to blow up the mausoleum of Attertwerk in Ankara\n\n2:26:22.220 --> 2:26:23.580\n with an airplane.\n\n2:26:23.580 --> 2:26:27.460\n And so if you kind of dig, it wasn't unimaginable\n\n2:26:27.460 --> 2:26:29.700\n that you would use an airplane as a weapon.\n\n2:26:29.700 --> 2:26:31.580\n And the Bush administration kept saying,\n\n2:26:31.580 --> 2:26:32.900\n no one had ever heard of this.\n\n2:26:32.900 --> 2:26:33.740\n Who would do this?\n\n2:26:33.740 --> 2:26:35.540\n Like, well, not a lot of people do this.\n\n2:26:35.540 --> 2:26:37.180\n And then at that very moment,\n\n2:26:37.180 --> 2:26:41.220\n my wife was teaching the Joseph Conrad novel Secret Agent,\n\n2:26:41.220 --> 2:26:44.100\n which was about a conspiratorial organization\n\n2:26:44.100 --> 2:26:46.340\n that wanted to bomb,\n\n2:26:46.340 --> 2:26:48.940\n actually in retrospect, it was kind of suicide bombing\n\n2:26:48.940 --> 2:26:50.660\n because they tricked this guy into doing it,\n\n2:26:50.660 --> 2:26:53.460\n but they wanted to bomb the Greenwich Observatory\n\n2:26:53.460 --> 2:26:55.340\n for some obscure political purpose.\n\n2:26:57.140 --> 2:27:00.660\n So that's an instance in which, you know, the novel,\n\n2:27:00.660 --> 2:27:02.460\n right, to go back to our kind of humanities pitch, right,\n\n2:27:02.460 --> 2:27:05.940\n that my point was that, you know,\n\n2:27:05.940 --> 2:27:08.180\n as you mentioned, we need humanity, transparency,\n\n2:27:08.180 --> 2:27:09.940\n but also imagination, right?\n\n2:27:09.940 --> 2:27:14.100\n I think part of expanding our imagination is by, you know,\n\n2:27:14.100 --> 2:27:16.580\n I mean, obviously delving into your fields, you know,\n\n2:27:16.580 --> 2:27:19.020\n of engineering and the sciences and robotics\n\n2:27:19.020 --> 2:27:20.860\n and artificial intelligence and all that rich landscape.\n\n2:27:20.860 --> 2:27:24.740\n And then, but also we find this in film, poetry, literature,\n\n2:27:24.740 --> 2:27:28.500\n I mean, just the kind of stretching that we need to do\n\n2:27:28.500 --> 2:27:31.460\n to really educate ourselves more fully, right,\n\n2:27:31.460 --> 2:27:34.860\n across the spectrum of everything humans need\n\n2:27:34.860 --> 2:27:37.340\n to imagine, to reimagine security.\n\n2:27:37.340 --> 2:27:38.660\n You know, so much of what we talked about today,\n\n2:27:38.660 --> 2:27:41.660\n I mean, so much of, you know,\n\n2:27:41.660 --> 2:27:43.860\n our security is affected by others perception\n\n2:27:43.860 --> 2:27:45.300\n of their insecurity, right?\n\n2:27:46.580 --> 2:27:49.620\n Which unleashes a whole web of emotions.\n\n2:27:49.620 --> 2:27:54.060\n Can you tell me about the Afghan people,\n\n2:27:54.060 --> 2:27:57.020\n what they love, what they fear,\n\n2:27:57.020 --> 2:28:00.100\n what they dream of for themselves and for their nation?\n\n2:28:00.100 --> 2:28:02.020\n Is there something to say,\n\n2:28:02.020 --> 2:28:04.860\n to speak to to the spirit of the people\n\n2:28:04.860 --> 2:28:09.620\n that may humanize them and maybe speak to the concerns\n\n2:28:09.620 --> 2:28:10.820\n and the hopes they have?\n\n2:28:12.020 --> 2:28:13.940\n Yeah, I think I, you know, as an outsider,\n\n2:28:13.940 --> 2:28:16.300\n I hesitate to make any grand statement,\n\n2:28:16.300 --> 2:28:17.900\n but I would say, listen, I mean,\n\n2:28:19.020 --> 2:28:21.540\n there are a number of documentary films\n\n2:28:21.540 --> 2:28:23.420\n that are incredibly rich\n\n2:28:23.420 --> 2:28:26.180\n that will offer your listeners and viewers a snapshot.\n\n2:28:26.180 --> 2:28:29.460\n So there is Afghan Star, you know,\n\n2:28:29.460 --> 2:28:32.500\n which really brings you in the homes of a set of people\n\n2:28:32.500 --> 2:28:34.980\n who, you know, they want stardom, they're artists,\n\n2:28:34.980 --> 2:28:36.700\n they want to express themselves.\n\n2:28:36.700 --> 2:28:39.940\n Some want to push political boundaries, cultural boundaries.\n\n2:28:39.940 --> 2:28:42.660\n There's a woman who gets into hot water for dancing.\n\n2:28:42.660 --> 2:28:46.460\n But yeah, you realize that, I mean, people,\n\n2:28:46.460 --> 2:28:48.020\n I mean, they love art, they love music,\n\n2:28:48.020 --> 2:28:50.700\n they love poetry, they love expression.\n\n2:28:50.700 --> 2:28:52.820\n You know, people want to care for their children.\n\n2:28:52.820 --> 2:28:54.260\n They want safety of their families.\n\n2:28:54.260 --> 2:28:57.380\n They want to enjoy what everyone enjoys, you know?\n\n2:28:57.380 --> 2:29:00.540\n I think it's a very humanizing portrait.\n\n2:29:00.540 --> 2:29:01.660\n There's another great documentary film\n\n2:29:01.660 --> 2:29:05.700\n called Love Crimes of Kabul,\n\n2:29:06.620 --> 2:29:10.020\n which is a great snapshot of the post 2000 world\n\n2:29:10.020 --> 2:29:11.500\n that the Americans shaped a lot of ways.\n\n2:29:11.500 --> 2:29:13.580\n And it's about a women's prison.\n\n2:29:13.580 --> 2:29:15.500\n And it's incredibly revealing\n\n2:29:15.500 --> 2:29:19.820\n because it's about young girls and what they want.\n\n2:29:19.820 --> 2:29:22.220\n Well, not just young, but young, teenage,\n\n2:29:22.220 --> 2:29:23.420\n and then some middle aged people\n\n2:29:23.420 --> 2:29:26.180\n who are accused of moral crimes,\n\n2:29:26.180 --> 2:29:29.900\n ranging from homicide, which one woman admits to,\n\n2:29:29.900 --> 2:29:33.700\n to having sexual relations outside of marriage.\n\n2:29:33.700 --> 2:29:36.260\n And so it shows in a way continuity\n\n2:29:36.260 --> 2:29:38.660\n with the previous Taliban regime\n\n2:29:38.660 --> 2:29:40.340\n and that women are in prison\n\n2:29:40.340 --> 2:29:42.300\n for things that you wouldn't be in prison for elsewhere,\n\n2:29:42.300 --> 2:29:46.860\n and that Islamic law operates as the kind of judicial logic\n\n2:29:46.860 --> 2:29:50.180\n for these punishments.\n\n2:29:50.180 --> 2:29:52.700\n But letting these women kind of speak for themselves,\n\n2:29:52.700 --> 2:29:53.540\n I mean, it's fascinating.\n\n2:29:53.540 --> 2:29:55.100\n I mean, I don't want to get too much away,\n\n2:29:55.100 --> 2:29:58.820\n but women make very interesting choices in this film\n\n2:29:58.820 --> 2:30:00.300\n that land them in this predicament.\n\n2:30:00.300 --> 2:30:04.100\n So they don't all profess innocence.\n\n2:30:04.100 --> 2:30:06.980\n Some are like, I'm guilty, but they're guilty for reasons.\n\n2:30:06.980 --> 2:30:09.180\n In one case, one woman is guilty, she's in prison\n\n2:30:09.180 --> 2:30:12.100\n because it's a way to exert pressure on her fiancee\n\n2:30:12.100 --> 2:30:14.580\n to finally marry her, you know?\n\n2:30:14.580 --> 2:30:16.540\n So you get ethnicity, you get like, you know,\n\n2:30:16.540 --> 2:30:18.500\n kind of Romeo and Juliet things\n\n2:30:18.500 --> 2:30:20.580\n where their families don't like each other necessarily,\n\n2:30:20.580 --> 2:30:21.980\n but they find each other.\n\n2:30:21.980 --> 2:30:25.300\n You have questions of like, love, money, clothing,\n\n2:30:25.300 --> 2:30:28.180\n furniture, it's beautiful.\n\n2:30:28.180 --> 2:30:29.460\n And like, I mean, the parts with it,\n\n2:30:29.460 --> 2:30:30.980\n I remember showing it in class,\n\n2:30:30.980 --> 2:30:33.660\n there was a wonderful Afghan student who was a,\n\n2:30:33.660 --> 2:30:35.900\n I think a Fulbright at the ed school at Stanford,\n\n2:30:35.900 --> 2:30:37.660\n and she's a genius, she's amazing.\n\n2:30:38.900 --> 2:30:41.460\n It was awkward for her because talking about young women\n\n2:30:41.460 --> 2:30:44.500\n having sex and stuff, and it was just, it wasn't,\n\n2:30:44.500 --> 2:30:46.780\n you know, the snapshot of Afghanistan that she wanted.\n\n2:30:46.780 --> 2:30:47.700\n And obviously there's so much more,\n\n2:30:47.700 --> 2:30:50.380\n they're great writers and, you know, musicians.\n\n2:30:50.380 --> 2:30:52.260\n And I mean, you know, music is a huge thing.\n\n2:30:52.260 --> 2:30:54.380\n I mean, poetry, all those things are great.\n\n2:30:55.380 --> 2:30:57.500\n So she found it, you know, I hear you.\n\n2:30:57.500 --> 2:30:59.100\n I mean, it's kind of a taboo subject,\n\n2:30:59.100 --> 2:31:02.220\n but I thought the American students seeing it\n\n2:31:02.220 --> 2:31:04.780\n really identified with these women\n\n2:31:04.780 --> 2:31:05.700\n because they're just so real.\n\n2:31:05.700 --> 2:31:08.580\n And so, you know, young people trying to find like,\n\n2:31:08.580 --> 2:31:10.820\n I mean, relationships that are universal\n\n2:31:11.820 --> 2:31:14.820\n and circumstances that are very difficult.\n\n2:31:14.820 --> 2:31:16.820\n Love, love is universal.\n\n2:31:16.820 --> 2:31:17.780\n Yeah, yeah, so it's, I mean,\n\n2:31:17.780 --> 2:31:18.940\n we do have resources to humanize.\n\n2:31:18.940 --> 2:31:20.980\n I mean, you know, some of your people will know\n\n2:31:20.980 --> 2:31:23.780\n Khaled Hosseini, you know, he's an African American,\n\n2:31:23.780 --> 2:31:25.660\n he's done his stuff, but there are,\n\n2:31:25.660 --> 2:31:29.260\n there are a number of novelists and short story writers\n\n2:31:29.260 --> 2:31:30.420\n who do cool things.\n\n2:31:30.420 --> 2:31:33.300\n I think that another tragic aspect of this moment\n\n2:31:33.300 --> 2:31:35.100\n is that those people have now pretty much\n\n2:31:35.100 --> 2:31:36.180\n had to leave the country.\n\n2:31:36.180 --> 2:31:39.940\n So there's a visual artist I would highlight for you\n\n2:31:39.940 --> 2:31:44.940\n named Khadem Ali, who's a Hazara based in Australia.\n\n2:31:44.940 --> 2:31:48.460\n He does extraordinary work in blending a tradition\n\n2:31:48.460 --> 2:31:52.860\n of Persian miniatures with contemporary political commentary.\n\n2:31:54.500 --> 2:31:56.020\n His work is between Australia and Afghanistan,\n\n2:31:56.020 --> 2:31:57.340\n but he also, he had to flee.\n\n2:31:57.340 --> 2:31:59.180\n I mean, he was doing some work in Kabul,\n\n2:31:59.180 --> 2:32:04.180\n but it's a extraordinary kind of visual language\n\n2:32:04.180 --> 2:32:06.620\n that he's adopted that has been shown all over the planet now.\n\n2:32:06.620 --> 2:32:08.300\n He's got some of his work is in New York galleries,\n\n2:32:08.300 --> 2:32:09.140\n is in Europe.\n\n2:32:10.300 --> 2:32:11.140\n He's been shown in Australia,\n\n2:32:11.140 --> 2:32:13.180\n but he talks about migration in a way\n\n2:32:13.180 --> 2:32:16.380\n that puts Afghans and Hazaras at the center,\n\n2:32:16.380 --> 2:32:20.180\n but it's totally universal about, you know,\n\n2:32:20.180 --> 2:32:23.300\n our modern crisis of all the mains people\n\n2:32:23.300 --> 2:32:24.860\n who were displaced across our planet.\n\n2:32:24.860 --> 2:32:28.540\n And he attempts to kind of speak for some size of them\n\n2:32:28.540 --> 2:32:30.500\n in a way that like everyone can get.\n\n2:32:31.460 --> 2:32:32.820\n I mean, the visual imagery experts will know\n\n2:32:32.820 --> 2:32:36.060\n that it's from, you know, like the Shah Naam,\n\n2:32:36.060 --> 2:32:38.980\n like an ancient Persian epic that Iranians were attached to,\n\n2:32:38.980 --> 2:32:41.660\n that Afghans are attached to, that people can quote,\n\n2:32:41.660 --> 2:32:44.180\n you know, at length, that has mythical figures\n\n2:32:44.180 --> 2:32:47.180\n of good and evil that kids grow up embodying.\n\n2:32:47.180 --> 2:32:50.140\n They're named the names of the characters that are,\n\n2:32:50.140 --> 2:32:52.340\n it's called, you know, the Book of Kings.\n\n2:32:52.340 --> 2:32:53.700\n The heroes and villains are the staple\n\n2:32:53.700 --> 2:32:58.700\n of conversation and poetry and, you know, like Russians,\n\n2:32:59.460 --> 2:33:02.500\n I mean, the kind of, the resort to literary references\n\n2:33:02.500 --> 2:33:04.460\n and speak is something that, you know,\n\n2:33:04.460 --> 2:33:07.260\n Americans don't do, most West European countries don't do,\n\n2:33:07.260 --> 2:33:09.260\n but the fact that everyone's got to know this character,\n\n2:33:09.260 --> 2:33:10.860\n everyone knows this reference,\n\n2:33:10.860 --> 2:33:15.860\n the wordplay, the linguistic finesse in multiple languages\n\n2:33:16.220 --> 2:33:20.620\n is, you know, a major value of Afghan storytelling.\n\n2:33:21.620 --> 2:33:25.340\n As an outsider, I'm scratching at the surface of the surface.\n\n2:33:25.340 --> 2:33:26.180\n Yeah, but there's a depth to it.\n\n2:33:26.180 --> 2:33:28.100\n It's just like, it is fascinating.\n\n2:33:28.100 --> 2:33:29.060\n With the layers, yeah.\n\n2:33:29.060 --> 2:33:31.660\n With the layers of Russian language that's.\n\n2:33:31.660 --> 2:33:32.500\n Exactly.\n\n2:33:32.500 --> 2:33:36.060\n The culture, it's a, I've been struggling,\n\n2:33:36.060 --> 2:33:40.300\n and this is kind of the journey I'm embarking on\n\n2:33:40.300 --> 2:33:43.180\n to convey to an American audience\n\n2:33:43.180 --> 2:33:47.860\n what is lost in translation between Russian and English.\n\n2:33:47.860 --> 2:33:51.540\n And it's very challenging in some of the great translators\n\n2:33:51.540 --> 2:33:55.220\n of Dostoevsky, of Tolstoy, of Russian literature,\n\n2:33:55.220 --> 2:33:56.700\n struggle with this deeply.\n\n2:33:56.700 --> 2:34:01.260\n And they work, it's an art form just to convey that.\n\n2:34:01.260 --> 2:34:03.780\n And it's amazing to hear that Afghanistan,\n\n2:34:03.780 --> 2:34:06.700\n with a full mix of cultures that are there,\n\n2:34:06.700 --> 2:34:10.980\n have the same kind of wit and humor and depth of intellect.\n\n2:34:10.980 --> 2:34:13.100\n I mean, the humor thing is, that's, you know,\n\n2:34:13.100 --> 2:34:14.100\n I'm so much of our visual imagery\n\n2:34:14.100 --> 2:34:15.980\n is about like this sad place in Dower or whatever,\n\n2:34:15.980 --> 2:34:18.540\n but the, I mean, socially, again,\n\n2:34:18.540 --> 2:34:19.780\n I'm gonna engage in some stereotypes\n\n2:34:19.780 --> 2:34:21.940\n about generalization stuff, but just the,\n\n2:34:22.940 --> 2:34:25.220\n you know, the Afghan friends that I've come to\n\n2:34:25.220 --> 2:34:28.380\n be close with and really love, I mean, the humor,\n\n2:34:28.380 --> 2:34:31.340\n there's so much there of common stuff of like,\n\n2:34:31.340 --> 2:34:33.340\n when I go to Ireland, it's one of my favorite places\n\n2:34:33.340 --> 2:34:36.260\n and just like the, I feel a sense of pressure,\n\n2:34:36.260 --> 2:34:38.020\n like the humor all around me at the time.\n\n2:34:38.020 --> 2:34:40.580\n I mean, I feel like there's something between Ireland\n\n2:34:40.580 --> 2:34:43.740\n and Russia with the humor stuff where it's like,\n\n2:34:43.740 --> 2:34:46.220\n you've gotta be on your game if you wanna be, you know,\n\n2:34:46.220 --> 2:34:51.220\n so it's, yeah, I feel like the intensity of conversation\n\n2:34:52.140 --> 2:34:54.260\n in terms of, yeah, you have to be on your game\n\n2:34:54.260 --> 2:34:55.980\n in terms of wit and so on.\n\n2:34:55.980 --> 2:34:58.340\n I mean, you have to, there's certain people I have,\n\n2:34:58.340 --> 2:34:59.620\n like when I talk on this podcast,\n\n2:34:59.620 --> 2:35:02.620\n they're like that, certain people from the Jewish tradition\n\n2:35:02.620 --> 2:35:05.460\n have that, like where the wit is just like,\n\n2:35:05.460 --> 2:35:09.340\n okay, I have to, oh yeah, I really have to pay attention.\n\n2:35:09.340 --> 2:35:12.380\n It's a game, it's like, you know what it feels like?\n\n2:35:12.380 --> 2:35:14.660\n It feels like speed chess or something like that\n\n2:35:14.660 --> 2:35:17.420\n and you really have to focus and play\n\n2:35:17.420 --> 2:35:19.900\n and at the same time, there's body language in the,\n\n2:35:19.900 --> 2:35:22.260\n and then there's a melancholy nature to it,\n\n2:35:22.260 --> 2:35:23.860\n at least in the Russian side.\n\n2:35:23.860 --> 2:35:25.780\n The whole thing is just a beautiful mess.\n\n2:35:25.780 --> 2:35:27.060\n Yeah, I mean, there's a funny TikTok video\n\n2:35:27.060 --> 2:35:29.620\n that went around that I got from like some Afghan\n\n2:35:29.620 --> 2:35:33.100\n acquaintances that was a, that he's an Irish comedian\n\n2:35:33.100 --> 2:35:35.820\n kind of highlighting, you know,\n\n2:35:35.820 --> 2:35:38.060\n kind of Irish and German national stereotypes\n\n2:35:38.060 --> 2:35:39.740\n around hospitality.\n\n2:35:39.740 --> 2:35:41.540\n And this Afghan woman said, you know,\n\n2:35:41.540 --> 2:35:44.980\n I didn't know that the Irish were just white Afghans\n\n2:35:44.980 --> 2:35:46.260\n because the whole, like, you know, the hospitality,\n\n2:35:46.260 --> 2:35:48.380\n like politics of like, of refusal.\n\n2:35:48.380 --> 2:35:51.140\n You know, you don't take something\n\n2:35:51.140 --> 2:35:52.180\n that's offered to you the first time.\n\n2:35:52.180 --> 2:35:56.780\n You don't, I mean, it's the culture of receiving a guest.\n\n2:35:56.780 --> 2:35:59.260\n You know, that's, you know, Americans aren't,\n\n2:35:59.260 --> 2:36:01.420\n I mean, that's not, you know, that's not always,\n\n2:36:01.420 --> 2:36:02.940\n I mean, the different, the regional cultures\n\n2:36:02.940 --> 2:36:03.780\n where that's the thing, there's whatever,\n\n2:36:03.780 --> 2:36:06.940\n but it's, I mean, the kind of like generosity\n\n2:36:06.940 --> 2:36:09.380\n and the kind of, you know, that's real.\n\n2:36:09.380 --> 2:36:11.420\n I mean, that's, and that's a cool thing.\n\n2:36:11.420 --> 2:36:12.260\n And that's amazing.\n\n2:36:12.260 --> 2:36:13.820\n That's, you know, the food, I mean, going off\n\n2:36:13.820 --> 2:36:17.500\n just the superficial things, but all of that,\n\n2:36:17.500 --> 2:36:22.500\n the warmth of hospitality and of wit and humanity.\n\n2:36:22.500 --> 2:36:25.780\n I mean, that's what we don't see viewing the place\n\n2:36:25.780 --> 2:36:27.660\n just through war and geopolitics\n\n2:36:27.660 --> 2:36:29.100\n and the moving pieces of the map and stuff.\n\n2:36:29.100 --> 2:36:31.700\n And that's hard to see when, you know,\n\n2:36:31.700 --> 2:36:34.900\n there are gaps in language and in religious tradition\n\n2:36:34.900 --> 2:36:35.820\n and all that stuff.\n\n2:36:35.820 --> 2:36:38.380\n And then, you know, being open to the fact\n\n2:36:38.380 --> 2:36:41.060\n that people do things differently, you know,\n\n2:36:41.060 --> 2:36:43.500\n and it's, and the gender dimension there is important,\n\n2:36:43.500 --> 2:36:44.340\n right?\n\n2:36:44.340 --> 2:36:47.540\n They're kind of, you know, arguably each culture\n\n2:36:47.540 --> 2:36:49.140\n has a kind of gender dynamic that's different.\n\n2:36:49.140 --> 2:36:50.940\n And so I think it's helpful to have humility\n\n2:36:50.940 --> 2:36:53.100\n in thinking that some Afghans\n\n2:36:53.100 --> 2:36:55.660\n will do some things differently, you know.\n\n2:36:55.660 --> 2:36:58.580\n But then you'll also have Afghans who say,\n\n2:36:58.580 --> 2:36:59.820\n every woman should be educated.\n\n2:36:59.820 --> 2:37:01.260\n Everyone should work and so on and so on.\n\n2:37:01.260 --> 2:37:03.460\n So there's no, there's no single way of, yeah.\n\n2:37:03.460 --> 2:37:06.060\n And there is a gender dynamic in Russia too.\n\n2:37:06.060 --> 2:37:08.260\n We need to be respectful of that.\n\n2:37:08.260 --> 2:37:10.100\n And that's not always what it looks like at first.\n\n2:37:10.100 --> 2:37:10.940\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:37:10.940 --> 2:37:11.780\n There's layers.\n\n2:37:11.780 --> 2:37:12.600\n Where power is.\n\n2:37:12.600 --> 2:37:14.300\n I mean, that's definitely, I don't know, yeah.\n\n2:37:14.300 --> 2:37:16.060\n Yeah, that's a whole nother conversation\n\n2:37:16.060 --> 2:37:17.180\n where the power is.\n\n2:37:17.180 --> 2:37:18.220\n Yeah.\n\n2:37:18.220 --> 2:37:20.620\n Rumi, the 13th century Persian poet\n\n2:37:20.620 --> 2:37:23.980\n who was born on the land that is now Afghanistan.\n\n2:37:23.980 --> 2:37:26.940\n Is there something in his words that speaks to you\n\n2:37:26.940 --> 2:37:31.420\n about the spirit of the Afghan people?\n\n2:37:31.420 --> 2:37:33.060\n I mean, everyone owns Rumi, I guess I'd say.\n\n2:37:33.060 --> 2:37:34.060\n I mean, that's gonna get me in trouble\n\n2:37:34.060 --> 2:37:36.060\n with certain Afghan fans of Rumi\n\n2:37:36.060 --> 2:37:38.740\n who wanna see him as an Afghan.\n\n2:37:38.740 --> 2:37:39.580\n I would say.\n\n2:37:40.500 --> 2:37:42.020\n Are they proud of Rumi?\n\n2:37:42.020 --> 2:37:42.860\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:37:42.860 --> 2:37:44.020\n Do they see him as an Afghan?\n\n2:37:44.020 --> 2:37:44.860\n Do they?\n\n2:37:44.860 --> 2:37:46.180\n Yeah, I mean, it depends.\n\n2:37:46.180 --> 2:37:49.860\n I mean, some people will be militant and say,\n\n2:37:49.860 --> 2:37:51.100\n you know, the Iranian's gonna have him.\n\n2:37:51.100 --> 2:37:51.980\n He's ours.\n\n2:37:53.500 --> 2:37:55.940\n But they'll also say, you know, he's,\n\n2:37:55.940 --> 2:37:57.140\n I mean, you can say, I mean, again,\n\n2:37:57.140 --> 2:37:57.980\n he's like a Rorschach blot.\n\n2:37:57.980 --> 2:38:00.900\n I mean, he's a Sufi, he's a Muslim,\n\n2:38:00.900 --> 2:38:04.140\n he's a Central Asian, he's Iranian, he's Afghan,\n\n2:38:04.980 --> 2:38:05.940\n he's a Turk.\n\n2:38:05.940 --> 2:38:06.780\n I'm trying to think of the analogy,\n\n2:38:06.780 --> 2:38:08.940\n but he's something special to everyone.\n\n2:38:08.940 --> 2:38:11.060\n So I guess I would not walk into that conversation\n\n2:38:11.060 --> 2:38:12.700\n and claim that he's one or another,\n\n2:38:12.700 --> 2:38:13.540\n but it's a cool thing.\n\n2:38:13.540 --> 2:38:15.860\n I mean, it's the, but I'm glad you brought that up\n\n2:38:15.860 --> 2:38:20.700\n because that's a good way of seeing something that Afghans,\n\n2:38:20.700 --> 2:38:22.260\n I mean, we live in our country in Afghanistan\n\n2:38:22.260 --> 2:38:24.700\n and say, okay, Rumi's everyone, you know,\n\n2:38:24.700 --> 2:38:26.420\n Madonna helped make him famous in the United States,\n\n2:38:26.420 --> 2:38:27.860\n you know, for better, for worse.\n\n2:38:27.860 --> 2:38:29.180\n They used to sell stuff at Starbucks\n\n2:38:29.180 --> 2:38:32.020\n and that's all complicated and embarrassing.\n\n2:38:32.020 --> 2:38:35.140\n And his translations are very much disputed\n\n2:38:35.140 --> 2:38:36.420\n where you have people be like,\n\n2:38:36.420 --> 2:38:37.780\n there's some awful Rumi translations.\n\n2:38:37.780 --> 2:38:40.300\n And there are, there are also a lot of,\n\n2:38:40.300 --> 2:38:41.140\n speaking of the internet,\n\n2:38:41.140 --> 2:38:44.020\n there are lots of fake Rumi quotes, you know,\n\n2:38:44.020 --> 2:38:46.100\n like Rumi said, always be your best.\n\n2:38:46.100 --> 2:38:48.620\n Like, Rumi didn't say that, you know, that was, you know,\n\n2:38:48.620 --> 2:38:49.980\n I mean, that's kind of slow stuff like that.\n\n2:38:49.980 --> 2:38:52.380\n But the cool thing is like, I mean,\n\n2:38:52.380 --> 2:38:56.420\n I think you can read Rumi as a religious thinker,\n\n2:38:56.420 --> 2:38:59.060\n but you can also, you know, read Rumi as,\n\n2:39:00.500 --> 2:39:01.420\n you know, in an Islamic sense,\n\n2:39:01.420 --> 2:39:03.340\n but you can also read him as a kind of spiritualist, right?\n\n2:39:03.340 --> 2:39:05.260\n As someone who, or an ethicist or moralist.\n\n2:39:05.260 --> 2:39:09.420\n And so I think that's, I like the lens of Rumi\n\n2:39:09.420 --> 2:39:14.100\n as a gateway to Afghan ecumenism and cosmolitanism.\n\n2:39:14.100 --> 2:39:16.420\n You know, the theme I keep emphasizing of,\n\n2:39:16.420 --> 2:39:19.220\n of meeting actual Afghans who were actually,\n\n2:39:19.220 --> 2:39:21.380\n you know, fluent in Russian, fluent in German,\n\n2:39:21.380 --> 2:39:24.420\n fluent in Turkish, they know Dari, they know Pashto.\n\n2:39:26.100 --> 2:39:28.460\n They've gone to university or sometimes they haven't.\n\n2:39:28.460 --> 2:39:30.300\n And yet, I mean, they are,\n\n2:39:30.300 --> 2:39:34.260\n I like the category of the popular intellectual,\n\n2:39:34.260 --> 2:39:36.060\n you know, the intellectual who isn't,\n\n2:39:36.060 --> 2:39:37.940\n isn't formally educated necessarily.\n\n2:39:37.940 --> 2:39:39.500\n Although of course that's represented too,\n\n2:39:39.500 --> 2:39:41.100\n especially increasingly now with the generation\n\n2:39:41.100 --> 2:39:42.540\n of going to university all over the world,\n\n2:39:42.540 --> 2:39:44.540\n you know, Stanford, MIT, everywhere.\n\n2:39:45.500 --> 2:39:47.220\n Afghans are well represented there.\n\n2:39:47.220 --> 2:39:50.660\n But just being, I don't have any kind of worldly knowledge\n\n2:39:50.660 --> 2:39:54.700\n that is not limited to a province, to a village, to a hamlet.\n\n2:39:54.700 --> 2:39:58.140\n But sometimes it is, but sometimes it's not.\n\n2:39:58.140 --> 2:40:02.140\n Because of, again, not because of some fairy tale story\n\n2:40:02.140 --> 2:40:06.980\n of curiosity wandering the globe out of, you know,\n\n2:40:06.980 --> 2:40:10.220\n some sense of privilege, but out of necessity,\n\n2:40:10.220 --> 2:40:11.780\n out of survival of having to adapt.\n\n2:40:11.780 --> 2:40:14.780\n And it's really extraordinary that, I mean,\n\n2:40:14.780 --> 2:40:16.180\n also let me think about like professions,\n\n2:40:16.180 --> 2:40:20.460\n so like, you know, ask an Afghan, you know,\n\n2:40:20.460 --> 2:40:22.340\n what does he or she do for a living?\n\n2:40:22.340 --> 2:40:23.460\n And what have they done in the past?\n\n2:40:23.460 --> 2:40:25.060\n I mean, the answers one gets,\n\n2:40:25.060 --> 2:40:30.060\n shoe salesman, task cop drivers, surgeons, all in one guy.\n\n2:40:30.900 --> 2:40:31.740\n Yeah.\n\n2:40:31.740 --> 2:40:33.540\n I mean, that's not just Afghan,\n\n2:40:33.540 --> 2:40:35.340\n but that's, you know, that's very common.\n\n2:40:35.340 --> 2:40:37.420\n But it's also Russia is the same.\n\n2:40:37.420 --> 2:40:39.980\n I think it's whenever there's complexities\n\n2:40:39.980 --> 2:40:43.140\n to the economic system and the short term\n\n2:40:43.140 --> 2:40:46.300\n and the long term history of how the country develops.\n\n2:40:46.300 --> 2:40:49.980\n And it's basically the people figuring out their way\n\n2:40:49.980 --> 2:40:54.180\n around a mess of a country politically,\n\n2:40:54.180 --> 2:40:59.180\n but a beautiful, flourishing culture and humanity.\n\n2:40:59.340 --> 2:41:01.420\n And that creates super interesting people.\n\n2:41:01.420 --> 2:41:02.620\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:41:02.620 --> 2:41:05.660\n So we can often see, okay, there's Taliban, there's war,\n\n2:41:05.660 --> 2:41:09.620\n there's economic malfunction,\n\n2:41:09.620 --> 2:41:11.980\n there's harboring of terrorists, there's opium trade,\n\n2:41:11.980 --> 2:41:13.860\n all that kind of stuff, but there's humans there\n\n2:41:13.860 --> 2:41:16.780\n with deep intellectual lies.\n\n2:41:17.980 --> 2:41:21.220\n And like, I love the movie, Love Crimes.\n\n2:41:21.220 --> 2:41:25.740\n And the same kind of hopes, fears, and desire to love\n\n2:41:25.740 --> 2:41:27.740\n the old Romeo and Juliet story.\n\n2:41:27.740 --> 2:41:30.000\n And I think Rumi to me represents that.\n\n2:41:31.460 --> 2:41:36.460\n The wit, the intelligence, but also the just eloquent\n\n2:41:37.180 --> 2:41:40.860\n and just beautiful representation of humanity of love.\n\n2:41:40.860 --> 2:41:44.700\n Some of the best quotes about love are from him,\n\n2:41:44.700 --> 2:41:48.540\n half of them fake, half of them real, but.\n\n2:41:48.540 --> 2:41:49.380\n The best ones are real, right?\n\n2:41:49.380 --> 2:41:52.020\n The best ones are real, the best ones are real.\n\n2:41:52.020 --> 2:41:53.860\n Robert, this was an incredible conversation.\n\n2:41:53.860 --> 2:41:54.700\n Oh, thank you for having us.\n\n2:41:54.700 --> 2:41:59.380\n Thank you for the tour of Afghanistan\n\n2:41:59.380 --> 2:42:04.380\n and making me, making us realize that there's much more\n\n2:42:04.900 --> 2:42:09.020\n to this country than what we may think.\n\n2:42:09.020 --> 2:42:13.500\n It's a beautiful country and it's full of beautiful people.\n\n2:42:13.500 --> 2:42:15.020\n You made me think about a lot of new things too,\n\n2:42:15.020 --> 2:42:17.460\n so it was definitely, definitely great online too,\n\n2:42:17.460 --> 2:42:19.280\n so thank you so much.\n\n2:42:19.280 --> 2:42:20.740\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:42:20.740 --> 2:42:22.000\n with Robert Cruz.\n\n2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:24.700\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors\n\n2:42:24.700 --> 2:42:26.060\n in the description.\n\n2:42:26.060 --> 2:42:27.960\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n2:42:27.960 --> 2:42:29.760\n from Winston Churchill.\n\n2:42:29.760 --> 2:42:34.760\n \"'History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it.'\"\n\n2:42:34.760 --> 2:42:38.440\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
