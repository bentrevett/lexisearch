00:08.440\n Yeah, make yourself comfortable.\n\n00:08.440 --> 00:09.280\n Boo.\n\n00:09.280 --> 00:10.120\n No, wow, okay.\n\n00:10.120 --> 00:12.760\n You don't do the headphone thing?\n\n00:12.760 --> 00:13.600\n No.\n\n00:13.600 --> 00:14.420\n Okay.\n\n00:14.420 --> 00:15.840\n I mean, how close do I need to get up to the same place?\n\n00:15.840 --> 00:17.560\n The closer you are, the sexier you sound.\n\n00:17.560 --> 00:18.400\n Hey, babe.\n\n00:18.400 --> 00:19.220\n What's up?\n\n00:19.220 --> 00:20.880\n Can't get enough of your love, baby.\n\n00:20.880 --> 00:25.080\n I'm gonna clip that out\n\n00:25.080 --> 00:26.720\n any time somebody messages me about it.\n\n00:26.720 --> 00:30.120\n If you want my body and you think I'm sexy,\n\n00:30.120 --> 00:32.080\n come right out and tell me so.\n\n00:33.040 --> 00:36.000\n Do, do, do, do, do.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:38.840\n So good.\n\n00:38.840 --> 00:39.680\n So good.\n\n00:39.680 --> 00:41.880\n Okay, serious mode activate.\n\n00:41.880 --> 00:43.240\n All right.\n\n00:43.240 --> 00:44.360\n Serious mode.\n\n00:44.360 --> 00:45.200\n Come on, you're Russian.\n\n00:45.200 --> 00:46.020\n You can be serious.\n\n00:46.020 --> 00:46.860\n Yeah, I know.\n\n00:46.860 --> 00:47.700\n Everyone's serious all the time in Russia.\n\n00:47.700 --> 00:50.600\n Yeah, yeah, we'll get there.\n\n00:50.600 --> 00:51.920\n We'll get there.\n\n00:51.920 --> 00:52.760\n Yeah.\n\n00:52.760 --> 00:53.600\n It's gotten soft.\n\n00:53.600 --> 00:57.760\n Allow me to say that the SpaceX launch\n\n00:57.760 --> 01:00.960\n of human beings to orbit on May 30th, 2020\n\n01:02.160 --> 01:03.920\n was seen by many as the first step\n\n01:03.920 --> 01:07.440\n in a new era of human space exploration.\n\n01:07.440 --> 01:10.620\n These human space flight missions were a beacon of hope\n\n01:10.620 --> 01:12.740\n to me and to millions over the past two years\n\n01:12.740 --> 01:14.680\n as our world has been going through\n\n01:14.680 --> 01:18.080\n one of the most difficult periods in recent human history.\n\n01:18.080 --> 01:21.720\n We saw, we see the rise of division, fear, cynicism,\n\n01:21.720 --> 01:24.620\n and the loss of common humanity\n\n01:24.620 --> 01:26.380\n right when it is needed most.\n\n01:26.380 --> 01:29.080\n So first, Elon, let me say thank you\n\n01:29.080 --> 01:30.620\n for giving the world hope and reason\n\n01:30.620 --> 01:32.520\n to be excited about the future.\n\n01:32.520 --> 01:34.200\n Oh, it's kind of easy to say.\n\n01:34.200 --> 01:35.480\n I do want to do that.\n\n01:35.480 --> 01:38.320\n Humanity has obviously a lot of issues\n\n01:38.320 --> 01:42.620\n and people at times do bad things,\n\n01:42.620 --> 01:47.260\n but despite all that, I love humanity\n\n01:47.260 --> 01:52.260\n and I think we should make sure we do everything we can\n\n01:52.560 --> 01:54.640\n to have a good future and an exciting future\n\n01:54.640 --> 01:58.320\n and one where that maximizes the happiness of the people.\n\n01:58.320 --> 02:00.960\n Let me ask about Crew Dragon Demo 2.\n\n02:00.960 --> 02:03.480\n So that first flight with humans on board,\n\n02:04.360 --> 02:06.160\n how did you feel leading up to that launch?\n\n02:06.160 --> 02:07.280\n Were you scared?\n\n02:07.280 --> 02:08.260\n Were you excited?\n\n02:08.260 --> 02:09.640\n What was going through your mind?\n\n02:09.640 --> 02:11.380\n So much was at stake.\n\n02:11.380 --> 02:14.700\n Yeah, no, that was extremely stressful, no question.\n\n02:14.700 --> 02:19.140\n We obviously could not let them down in any way.\n\n02:19.140 --> 02:24.140\n So extremely stressful, I'd say, to say the least.\n\n02:25.940 --> 02:28.380\n I was confident that at the time that we launched\n\n02:28.380 --> 02:33.380\n that no one could think of anything at all to do\n\n02:34.140 --> 02:36.500\n that would improve the probability of success.\n\n02:36.500 --> 02:40.100\n And we racked our brains to think of any possible way\n\n02:40.100 --> 02:41.420\n to improve the probability of success.\n\n02:41.420 --> 02:44.820\n We could not think of anything more, nor could NASA.\n\n02:44.820 --> 02:48.060\n And so that's just the best that we could do.\n\n02:48.060 --> 02:51.860\n So then we went ahead and launched.\n\n02:51.860 --> 02:54.340\n Now, I'm not a religious person,\n\n02:54.340 --> 02:59.340\n but I nonetheless got on my knees and prayed for that mission.\n\n03:00.340 --> 03:01.940\n Were you able to sleep?\n\n03:01.940 --> 03:02.780\n No.\n\n03:02.780 --> 03:07.780\n How did it feel when it was a success,\n\n03:10.820 --> 03:12.780\n first when the launch was a success,\n\n03:12.780 --> 03:15.580\n and when they returned back home or back to Earth?\n\n03:16.940 --> 03:18.060\n It was a great relief.\n\n03:20.380 --> 03:23.480\n Yeah, for high stress situations,\n\n03:23.480 --> 03:26.060\n I find it's not so much elation as relief.\n\n03:26.060 --> 03:31.060\n And I think once, as we got more comfortable\n\n03:33.440 --> 03:34.600\n and proved out the systems,\n\n03:34.600 --> 03:39.600\n because we really got to make sure everything works,\n\n03:41.280 --> 03:43.200\n it was definitely a lot more enjoyable\n\n03:43.200 --> 03:46.520\n with the subsequent astronaut missions.\n\n03:46.520 --> 03:50.160\n And I thought the Inspiration mission\n\n03:50.160 --> 03:53.960\n was actually a very inspiring Inspiration 4 mission.\n\n03:53.960 --> 03:57.040\n I'd encourage people to watch the Inspiration documentary\n\n03:57.040 --> 03:58.880\n on Netflix, it's actually really good.\n\n04:00.280 --> 04:03.360\n And it really isn't, I was actually inspired by that.\n\n04:03.360 --> 04:07.760\n And so that one I felt I was kind of able\n\n04:07.760 --> 04:09.320\n to enjoy the actual mission\n\n04:09.320 --> 04:10.880\n and not just be super stressed all the time.\n\n04:10.880 --> 04:13.760\n So for people that somehow don't know,\n\n04:13.760 --> 04:17.240\n it's the all civilian, first time all civilian\n\n04:17.240 --> 04:19.400\n out to space, out to orbit.\n\n04:19.400 --> 04:22.480\n Yeah, and it was I think the highest orbit\n\n04:22.480 --> 04:26.120\n that in like, I don't know, 30 or 40 years or something.\n\n04:26.120 --> 04:29.480\n The only one that was higher was the one shuttle,\n\n04:29.480 --> 04:32.160\n sorry, a Hubble servicing mission.\n\n04:32.160 --> 04:35.980\n And then before that, it would have been Apollo in 72.\n\n04:37.840 --> 04:39.180\n It's pretty wild.\n\n04:39.180 --> 04:40.520\n So it's cool, it's good.\n\n04:40.520 --> 04:45.520\n I think as a species, we want to be continuing\n\n04:46.620 --> 04:50.000\n to do better and reach higher ground.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.880\n And like, I think it would be tragic, extremely tragic\n\n04:52.880 --> 04:57.000\n if Apollo was the high watermark for humanity,\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.800\n and that's as far as we ever got.\n\n05:00.080 --> 05:05.080\n And it's concerning that here we are 49 years\n\n05:06.360 --> 05:09.060\n after the last mission to the moon.\n\n05:09.060 --> 05:14.060\n And so almost half a century, and we've not been back.\n\n05:14.060 --> 05:16.260\n And that's worrying.\n\n05:16.260 --> 05:20.280\n It's like, does that mean we've peaked as a civilization\n\n05:20.280 --> 05:21.120\n or what?\n\n05:21.120 --> 05:24.480\n So like, I think we got to get back to the moon\n\n05:24.480 --> 05:27.160\n and build a base there, a science base.\n\n05:27.160 --> 05:28.880\n I think we could learn a lot about the nature\n\n05:28.880 --> 05:31.120\n of the universe if we have a proper science base\n\n05:31.120 --> 05:35.520\n on the moon, like we have a science base in Antarctica\n\n05:35.520 --> 05:38.080\n and many other parts of the world.\n\n05:38.080 --> 05:41.880\n And so that's like, I think the next big thing,\n\n05:41.880 --> 05:45.680\n we've got to have like a serious moon base\n\n05:45.680 --> 05:49.960\n and then get people to Mars and get out there\n\n05:49.960 --> 05:52.580\n and be a spacefaring civilization.\n\n05:52.580 --> 05:54.500\n I'll ask you about some of those details,\n\n05:54.500 --> 05:57.520\n but since you're so busy with the hard engineering\n\n05:57.520 --> 06:00.440\n challenges of everything that's involved,\n\n06:00.440 --> 06:03.000\n are you still able to marvel at the magic of it all,\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.880\n of space travel, of every time the rocket goes up,\n\n06:05.880 --> 06:08.120\n especially when it's a crewed mission?\n\n06:08.120 --> 06:11.440\n Or are you just so overwhelmed with all the challenges\n\n06:11.440 --> 06:12.560\n that you have to solve?\n\n06:12.560 --> 06:16.280\n And actually, sort of to add to that,\n\n06:16.280 --> 06:19.240\n the reason I wanted to ask this question of May 30th,\n\n06:19.240 --> 06:21.840\n it's been some time, so you can look back\n\n06:21.840 --> 06:23.520\n and think about the impact already.\n\n06:23.520 --> 06:26.360\n It's already, at the time it was an engineering problem\n\n06:26.360 --> 06:29.320\n maybe, now it's becoming a historic moment.\n\n06:29.320 --> 06:31.640\n Like it's a moment that, how many moments\n\n06:31.640 --> 06:33.720\n will be remembered about the 21st century?\n\n06:33.720 --> 06:37.300\n To me, that or something like that,\n\n06:37.300 --> 06:39.780\n maybe Inspiration4, one of those would be remembered\n\n06:39.780 --> 06:44.200\n as the early steps of a new age of space exploration.\n\n06:44.200 --> 06:46.640\n Yeah, I mean, during the launches itself,\n\n06:46.640 --> 06:49.120\n so I mean, I think maybe some people will know,\n\n06:49.120 --> 06:50.200\n but a lot of people don't know,\n\n06:50.200 --> 06:52.120\n is like I'm actually the chief engineer of SpaceX,\n\n06:52.120 --> 06:57.120\n so I've signed off on pretty much all the design decisions.\n\n06:59.040 --> 07:03.120\n And so if there's something that goes wrong\n\n07:03.120 --> 07:09.960\n with that vehicle, it's fundamentally my fault, so.\n\n07:09.960 --> 07:13.800\n So I'm really just thinking about all the things that,\n\n07:13.800 --> 07:15.600\n like, so when I see the rocket,\n\n07:15.600 --> 07:17.320\n I see all the things that could go wrong\n\n07:17.320 --> 07:18.520\n and the things that could be better\n\n07:18.520 --> 07:21.480\n and the same with the Dragon spacecraft.\n\n07:21.480 --> 07:23.440\n It's like, other people will see,\n\n07:23.440 --> 07:25.600\n oh, this is a spacecraft or a rocket\n\n07:25.600 --> 07:27.040\n and this looks really cool.\n\n07:27.040 --> 07:29.600\n I'm like, I've like a readout of like,\n\n07:29.600 --> 07:32.600\n these are the risks, these are the problems,\n\n07:32.600 --> 07:33.840\n that's what I see.\n\n07:33.840 --> 07:36.320\n Like, choo choo choo choo choo choo choo.\n\n07:36.320 --> 07:38.840\n So it's not what other people see\n\n07:38.840 --> 07:40.400\n when they see the product, you know.\n\n07:40.400 --> 07:43.040\n So let me ask you then to analyze Starship\n\n07:43.040 --> 07:44.360\n in that same way.\n\n07:44.360 --> 07:46.520\n I know you have, you'll talk about,\n\n07:46.520 --> 07:49.560\n in more detail about Starship in the near future, perhaps.\n\n07:49.560 --> 07:51.800\n Yeah, we can talk about it now if you want.\n\n07:51.800 --> 07:54.120\n But just in that same way, like you said,\n\n07:54.120 --> 07:57.620\n you see, when you see a rocket,\n\n07:57.620 --> 07:59.160\n you see sort of a list of risks.\n\n07:59.160 --> 08:01.040\n In that same way, you said that Starship\n\n08:01.040 --> 08:03.240\n is a really hard problem.\n\n08:03.240 --> 08:05.480\n So there's many ways I can ask this,\n\n08:05.480 --> 08:09.560\n but if you magically could solve one problem perfectly,\n\n08:09.560 --> 08:11.740\n one engineering problem perfectly,\n\n08:11.740 --> 08:13.000\n which one would it be?\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:14.120\n On Starship?\n\n08:14.120 --> 08:15.540\n On, sorry, on Starship.\n\n08:15.540 --> 08:18.040\n So is it maybe related to the efficiency,\n\n08:18.040 --> 08:21.360\n the engine, the weight of the different components,\n\n08:21.360 --> 08:22.680\n the complexity of various things,\n\n08:22.680 --> 08:26.720\n maybe the controls of the crazy thing it has to do to land?\n\n08:26.720 --> 08:30.080\n No, it's actually by far the biggest thing\n\n08:30.080 --> 08:33.720\n absorbing my time is engine production.\n\n08:35.080 --> 08:36.480\n Not the design of the engine,\n\n08:36.480 --> 08:41.480\n but I've often said prototypes are easy, production is hard.\n\n08:45.360 --> 08:48.680\n So we have the most advanced rocket engine\n\n08:48.680 --> 08:50.240\n that's ever been designed.\n\n08:52.720 --> 08:55.260\n Cause I'd say currently the best rocket engine ever\n\n08:55.260 --> 09:00.260\n is probably the RD180 or RD170,\n\n09:00.320 --> 09:02.600\n that's the Russian engine basically.\n\n09:03.640 --> 09:06.760\n And still, I think an engine should only count\n\n09:06.760 --> 09:09.000\n if it's gotten something to orbit.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.720\n So our engine has not gotten anything to orbit yet,\n\n09:12.720 --> 09:14.600\n but it is, it's the first engine\n\n09:14.600 --> 09:19.600\n that's actually better than the Russian RD engines,\n\n09:20.240 --> 09:22.680\n which were amazing design.\n\n09:22.680 --> 09:24.120\n So you're talking about Raptor engine.\n\n09:24.120 --> 09:25.520\n What makes it amazing?\n\n09:25.520 --> 09:29.280\n What are the different aspects of it that make it,\n\n09:29.280 --> 09:31.920\n like what are you the most excited about\n\n09:31.920 --> 09:35.080\n if the whole thing works in terms of efficiency,\n\n09:35.080 --> 09:37.120\n all those kinds of things?\n\n09:37.120 --> 09:42.000\n Well, it's, the Raptor is a full flow\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:46.360\n staged combustion engine\n\n09:46.360 --> 09:50.840\n and it's operating at a very high chamber pressure.\n\n09:50.840 --> 09:54.800\n So one of the key figures of merit, perhaps the key figure\n\n09:54.800 --> 09:58.680\n of merit is what is the chamber pressure\n\n09:58.680 --> 10:00.800\n at which the rocket engine can operate?\n\n10:00.800 --> 10:03.040\n That's the combustion chamber pressure.\n\n10:03.040 --> 10:06.960\n So Raptor is designed to operate at 300 bar,\n\n10:06.960 --> 10:10.320\n possibly maybe higher, that's 300 atmospheres.\n\n10:10.320 --> 10:15.320\n So the record right now for operational engine\n\n10:15.880 --> 10:17.880\n is the RD engine that I mentioned, the Russian RD,\n\n10:17.880 --> 10:21.300\n which is I believe around 267 bar.\n\n10:22.560 --> 10:25.840\n And the difficulty of the chamber pressure\n\n10:25.840 --> 10:27.860\n is increases on a nonlinear basis.\n\n10:27.860 --> 10:32.860\n So 10% more chamber pressure is more like 50% more difficult.\n\n10:36.960 --> 10:38.640\n But that chamber pressure is,\n\n10:38.640 --> 10:42.920\n that is what allows you to get a very high power density\n\n10:44.400 --> 10:45.220\n for the engine.\n\n10:45.220 --> 10:50.220\n So enabling a very high thrust to weight ratio\n\n10:53.300 --> 10:57.020\n and a very high specific impulse.\n\n10:57.020 --> 10:59.820\n So specific impulse is like a measure of the efficiency\n\n10:59.820 --> 11:01.700\n of a rocket engine.\n\n11:01.700 --> 11:06.700\n It's really the effect of exhaust velocity\n\n11:07.820 --> 11:10.120\n of the gas coming out of the engine.\n\n11:10.120 --> 11:15.120\n So with a very high chamber pressure,\n\n11:17.160 --> 11:21.600\n you can have a compact engine\n\n11:21.600 --> 11:24.000\n that nonetheless has a high expansion ratio,\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:29.000\n which is the ratio between the exit nozzle and the throat.\n\n11:31.800 --> 11:35.640\n So you see a rocket engine's got sort of like a hourglass\n\n11:35.640 --> 11:38.120\n shape, it's like a chamber and then it necks down\n\n11:38.120 --> 11:41.880\n and there's a nozzle and the ratio of the exit diameter\n\n11:41.880 --> 11:45.960\n to the throat is the expansion ratio.\n\n11:45.960 --> 11:49.640\n So why is it such a hard engine to manufacture at scale?\n\n11:51.400 --> 11:53.120\n It's very complex.\n\n11:53.120 --> 11:55.200\n So a lot of, what is complexity mean here?\n\n11:55.200 --> 11:56.760\n There's a lot of components involved.\n\n11:56.760 --> 12:01.760\n There's a lot of components and a lot of unique materials\n\n12:02.400 --> 12:07.040\n that, so we had to invent several alloys\n\n12:07.040 --> 12:09.600\n that don't exist in order to make this engine work.\n\n12:11.520 --> 12:13.040\n It's a materials problem too.\n\n12:14.560 --> 12:19.560\n It's a materials problem and in a staged combustion,\n\n12:19.760 --> 12:21.200\n a full flow staged combustion,\n\n12:21.200 --> 12:24.160\n there are many feedback loops in the system.\n\n12:24.160 --> 12:29.160\n So basically you've got propellants and hot gas\n\n12:31.820 --> 12:36.820\n flowing simultaneously to so many different places\n\n12:36.820 --> 12:41.820\n on the engine and they all have a recursive effect\n\n12:42.740 --> 12:43.700\n on each other.\n\n12:43.700 --> 12:45.780\n So you change one thing here, it has a recursive effect\n\n12:45.780 --> 12:47.420\n here, it changes something over there\n\n12:47.420 --> 12:51.380\n and it's quite hard to control.\n\n12:52.740 --> 12:54.980\n Like there's a reason no one's made this before.\n\n12:58.700 --> 13:03.700\n And the reason we're doing a staged combustion full flow\n\n13:03.700 --> 13:08.700\n is because it has the highest possible efficiency.\n\n13:12.740 --> 13:17.740\n So in order to make a fully reusable rocket,\n\n13:19.380 --> 13:23.200\n which that's the really the holy grail of orbital rocketry.\n\n13:25.340 --> 13:28.420\n You have to have, everything's gotta be the best.\n\n13:28.420 --> 13:30.900\n It's gotta be the best engine, the best airframe,\n\n13:30.900 --> 13:35.900\n the best heat shield, extremely light avionics,\n\n13:38.100 --> 13:40.620\n very clever control mechanisms.\n\n13:40.620 --> 13:45.100\n You've got to shed mass in any possible way that you can.\n\n13:45.100 --> 13:47.620\n For example, we are, instead of putting landing legs\n\n13:47.620 --> 13:49.580\n on the booster and ship, we are gonna catch them\n\n13:49.580 --> 13:53.220\n with a tower to save the weight of the landing legs.\n\n13:53.220 --> 13:58.220\n So that's like, I mean, we're talking about catching\n\n13:58.220 --> 14:03.220\n the largest flying object ever made with,\n\n14:03.340 --> 14:06.660\n on a giant tower with chopstick arms.\n\n14:06.660 --> 14:09.660\n It's like Karate Kid with the fly, but much bigger.\n\n14:12.060 --> 14:12.900\n I mean, pulling something like that home.\n\n14:12.900 --> 14:15.460\n This probably won't work the first time.\n\n14:17.620 --> 14:19.820\n Anyway, so this is bananas, this is banana stuff.\n\n14:19.820 --> 14:23.100\n So you mentioned that you doubt, well, not you doubt,\n\n14:23.100 --> 14:26.460\n but there's days or moments when you doubt\n\n14:26.460 --> 14:28.340\n that this is even possible.\n\n14:28.340 --> 14:30.120\n It's so difficult.\n\n14:30.120 --> 14:34.120\n The possible part is, well, at this point,\n\n14:35.420 --> 14:37.480\n I think we will get Starship to work.\n\n14:41.380 --> 14:42.860\n There's a question of timing.\n\n14:42.860 --> 14:45.460\n How long will it take us to do this?\n\n14:45.460 --> 14:47.700\n How long will it take us to actually achieve\n\n14:47.700 --> 14:49.060\n full and rapid reusability?\n\n14:50.500 --> 14:52.680\n Cause it will take probably many launches\n\n14:52.680 --> 14:56.760\n before we are able to have full and rapid reusability.\n\n14:57.660 --> 15:01.540\n But I can say that the physics pencils out.\n\n15:01.540 --> 15:06.540\n Like we're not, like at this point,\n\n15:06.620 --> 15:10.100\n I'd say we're confident that, like let's say,\n\n15:10.100 --> 15:12.620\n I'm very confident success is in the set\n\n15:12.620 --> 15:13.820\n of all possible outcomes.\n\n15:13.820 --> 15:18.340\n For a while there, I was not convinced\n\n15:18.340 --> 15:20.820\n that success was in the set of possible outcomes,\n\n15:20.820 --> 15:23.820\n which is very important actually.\n\n15:23.820 --> 15:28.820\n But so we're saying there's a chance.\n\n15:29.700 --> 15:31.500\n I'm saying there's a chance, exactly.\n\n15:33.260 --> 15:37.100\n Just not sure how long it will take.\n\n15:38.260 --> 15:39.580\n We have a very talented team.\n\n15:39.580 --> 15:42.080\n They're working night and day to make it happen.\n\n15:43.420 --> 15:48.260\n And like I said, the critical thing to achieve\n\n15:48.260 --> 15:49.540\n for the revolution in space flight\n\n15:49.540 --> 15:52.020\n and for humanity to be a spacefaring civilization\n\n15:52.020 --> 15:54.380\n is to have a fully and rapidly reusable rocket,\n\n15:54.380 --> 15:55.220\n orbital rocket.\n\n15:56.500 --> 15:58.820\n There's not even been any orbital rocket\n\n15:58.820 --> 16:00.100\n that's been fully reusable ever.\n\n16:00.100 --> 16:05.040\n And this has always been the holy grail of rocketry.\n\n16:06.020 --> 16:09.700\n And many smart people, very smart people,\n\n16:09.700 --> 16:12.700\n have tried to do this before and they've not succeeded.\n\n16:12.700 --> 16:16.100\n So, cause it's such a hard problem.\n\n16:16.100 --> 16:21.100\n What's your source of belief in situations like this?\n\n16:21.220 --> 16:23.580\n When the engineering problem is so difficult,\n\n16:23.580 --> 16:27.500\n there's a lot of experts, many of whom you admire,\n\n16:27.500 --> 16:29.220\n who have failed in the past.\n\n16:29.220 --> 16:34.220\n And a lot of people, a lot of experts,\n\n16:37.220 --> 16:38.860\n maybe journalists, all the kind of,\n\n16:38.860 --> 16:40.900\n the public in general have a lot of doubt\n\n16:40.900 --> 16:42.820\n about whether it's possible.\n\n16:42.820 --> 16:47.340\n And you yourself know that even if it's a non null set,\n\n16:47.340 --> 16:50.580\n non empty set of success, it's still unlikely\n\n16:50.580 --> 16:52.140\n or very difficult.\n\n16:52.140 --> 16:54.740\n Like where do you go to, both personally,\n\n16:55.780 --> 16:58.920\n intellectually as an engineer, as a team,\n\n16:58.920 --> 17:00.860\n like for source of strength needed\n\n17:00.860 --> 17:02.560\n to sort of persevere through this.\n\n17:02.560 --> 17:18.560\n And to keep going with the project, take it to completion.\n\n17:18.560 --> 17:19.800\n A source of strength.\n\n17:19.800 --> 17:21.880\n That's really not how I think about things.\n\n17:23.600 --> 17:25.000\n I mean, for me, it's simply this,\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:28.080\n this is something that is important to get done\n\n17:28.080 --> 17:32.480\n and we should just keep doing it or die trying.\n\n17:32.480 --> 17:35.920\n And I don't need a source of strength.\n\n17:35.920 --> 17:39.000\n So quitting is not even like...\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.520\n That's not, it's not in my nature.\n\n17:41.520 --> 17:45.080\n And I don't care about optimism or pessimism.\n\n17:46.240 --> 17:47.880\n Fuck that, we're gonna get it done.\n\n17:47.880 --> 17:48.800\n Gonna get it done.\n\n17:51.720 --> 17:55.160\n Can you then zoom back in to specific problems\n\n17:55.160 --> 17:58.300\n with Starship or any engineering problems you work on?\n\n17:58.300 --> 18:00.900\n Can you try to introspect your particular\n\n18:00.900 --> 18:03.520\n biological neural network, your thinking process\n\n18:03.520 --> 18:06.120\n and describe how you think through problems,\n\n18:06.120 --> 18:07.960\n the different engineering and design problems?\n\n18:07.960 --> 18:10.080\n Is there like a systematic process?\n\n18:10.080 --> 18:11.880\n You've spoken about first principles thinking,\n\n18:11.880 --> 18:14.140\n but is there a kind of process to it?\n\n18:14.140 --> 18:19.140\n Well, yeah, like saying like physics is a law\n\n18:19.200 --> 18:21.640\n and everything else is a recommendation.\n\n18:21.640 --> 18:23.200\n Like I've met a lot of people that can break the law,\n\n18:23.200 --> 18:25.700\n but I haven't met anyone who could break physics.\n\n18:25.700 --> 18:30.700\n So the first, for any kind of technology problem,\n\n18:32.520 --> 18:34.560\n you have to sort of just make sure\n\n18:34.560 --> 18:37.880\n you're not violating physics.\n\n18:39.960 --> 18:44.960\n And first principles analysis, I think,\n\n18:45.120 --> 18:49.200\n is something that can be applied to really any walk of life,\n\n18:49.200 --> 18:50.040\n anything really.\n\n18:50.040 --> 18:54.680\n It's really just saying, let's boil something down\n\n18:54.680 --> 18:58.440\n to the most fundamental principles.\n\n18:58.440 --> 19:00.840\n The things that we are most confident are true\n\n19:00.840 --> 19:02.480\n at a foundational level.\n\n19:02.480 --> 19:05.040\n And that sets your axiomatic base,\n\n19:05.040 --> 19:07.000\n and then you reason up from there,\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.040\n and then you cross check your conclusion\n\n19:09.040 --> 19:11.340\n against the axiomatic truths.\n\n19:13.680 --> 19:18.120\n So some basics in physics would be like,\n\n19:18.120 --> 19:20.280\n are you violating conservation of energy or momentum\n\n19:20.280 --> 19:21.400\n or something like that?\n\n19:21.400 --> 19:26.400\n Then it's not gonna work.\n\n19:29.560 --> 19:32.960\n So that's just to establish, is it possible?\n\n19:32.960 --> 19:34.760\n And another good physics tool\n\n19:34.760 --> 19:36.480\n is thinking about things in the limit.\n\n19:36.480 --> 19:38.360\n If you take a particular thing\n\n19:38.360 --> 19:41.680\n and you scale it to a very large number\n\n19:41.680 --> 19:44.840\n or to a very small number, how do things change?\n\n19:45.960 --> 19:48.920\n Both like in number of things you manufacture\n\n19:48.920 --> 19:51.640\n or something like that, and then in time?\n\n19:51.640 --> 19:55.920\n Yeah, like let's say take an example of like manufacturing,\n\n19:55.920 --> 19:59.140\n which I think is just a very underrated problem.\n\n20:00.400 --> 20:05.140\n And like I said, it's much harder to\n\n20:06.720 --> 20:09.520\n take an advanced technology product\n\n20:09.520 --> 20:11.000\n and bring it into volume manufacturing\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:12.880\n than it is to design it in the first place.\n\n20:12.880 --> 20:14.480\n My orders of magnitude.\n\n20:14.480 --> 20:17.800\n So let's say you're trying to figure out\n\n20:17.800 --> 20:22.800\n is like why is this part or product expensive?\n\n20:23.960 --> 20:27.400\n Is it because of something fundamentally foolish\n\n20:27.400 --> 20:31.320\n that we're doing or is it because our volume is too low?\n\n20:31.320 --> 20:32.840\n And so then you say, okay, well, what if our volume\n\n20:32.840 --> 20:34.220\n was a million units a year?\n\n20:34.220 --> 20:35.740\n Is it still expensive?\n\n20:35.740 --> 20:38.120\n That's what I mean by thinking about things in the limit.\n\n20:38.120 --> 20:40.140\n If it's still expensive at a million units a year,\n\n20:40.140 --> 20:42.500\n then volume is not the reason why your thing is expensive.\n\n20:42.500 --> 20:44.700\n There's something fundamental about the design.\n\n20:44.700 --> 20:47.440\n And then you then can focus on reducing the complexity\n\n20:47.440 --> 20:48.280\n or something like that in the design.\n\n20:48.280 --> 20:50.600\n You gotta change the design to change the part\n\n20:50.600 --> 20:55.600\n to be something that is not fundamentally expensive.\n\n20:56.440 --> 20:58.920\n But like that's a common thing in rocketry\n\n20:58.920 --> 21:01.840\n because the unit volume is relatively low.\n\n21:01.840 --> 21:04.120\n And so a common excuse would be,\n\n21:04.120 --> 21:06.480\n well, it's expensive because our unit volume is low.\n\n21:06.480 --> 21:08.760\n And if we were in like automotive or something like that,\n\n21:08.760 --> 21:10.920\n or consumer electronics, then our costs would be lower.\n\n21:10.920 --> 21:13.080\n I'm like, okay, so let's say\n\n21:13.080 --> 21:14.620\n now you're making a million units a year.\n\n21:14.620 --> 21:16.080\n Is it still expensive?\n\n21:16.080 --> 21:20.560\n If the answer is yes, then economies of scale\n\n21:20.560 --> 21:22.120\n are not the issue.\n\n21:22.120 --> 21:24.120\n Do you throw into manufacturing,\n\n21:24.120 --> 21:26.080\n do you throw like supply chain?\n\n21:26.080 --> 21:28.520\n Talked about resources and materials and stuff like that.\n\n21:28.520 --> 21:29.960\n Do you throw that into the calculation\n\n21:29.960 --> 21:31.800\n of trying to reason from first principles,\n\n21:31.800 --> 21:34.640\n like how we're gonna make the supply chain work here?\n\n21:34.640 --> 21:35.760\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n21:35.760 --> 21:37.840\n And then the cost of materials, things like that.\n\n21:37.840 --> 21:38.960\n Or is that too much?\n\n21:38.960 --> 21:41.880\n Exactly, so like a good example,\n\n21:41.880 --> 21:44.440\n I think of thinking about things in the limit\n\n21:44.440 --> 21:49.440\n is if you take any machine or whatever,\n\n21:54.360 --> 21:56.040\n like take a rocket or whatever,\n\n21:56.040 --> 22:01.040\n and say, if you look at the raw materials in the rocket,\n\n22:03.640 --> 22:07.560\n so you're gonna have like aluminum, steel, titanium,\n\n22:07.560 --> 22:12.560\n Inconel, specialty alloys, copper,\n\n22:12.560 --> 22:17.560\n and you say, what's the weight of the constituent elements,\n\n22:19.200 --> 22:20.440\n of each of these elements,\n\n22:20.440 --> 22:22.600\n and what is their raw material value?\n\n22:22.600 --> 22:25.720\n And that sets the asymptotic limit\n\n22:25.720 --> 22:29.480\n for how low the cost of the vehicle can be\n\n22:29.480 --> 22:31.800\n unless you change the materials.\n\n22:31.800 --> 22:33.960\n So, and then when you do that,\n\n22:33.960 --> 22:35.760\n I call it like maybe the magic one number\n\n22:35.760 --> 22:36.600\n or something like that.\n\n22:36.600 --> 22:38.760\n So that would be like, if you had the,\n\n22:40.320 --> 22:42.440\n like just a pile of these raw materials,\n\n22:42.440 --> 22:43.680\n again, you could wave the magic wand\n\n22:43.680 --> 22:45.920\n and rearrange the atoms into the final shape.\n\n22:47.160 --> 22:49.600\n That would be the lowest possible cost\n\n22:49.600 --> 22:51.000\n that you could make this thing for\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:52.720\n unless you change the materials.\n\n22:52.720 --> 22:56.400\n So then, and that is almost always a very low number.\n\n22:57.760 --> 23:01.200\n So then what's actually causing things to be expensive\n\n23:01.200 --> 23:04.080\n is how you put the atoms into the desired shape.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:09.000\n Yeah, actually, if you don't mind me taking a tiny tangent,\n\n23:10.120 --> 23:11.440\n I often talk to Jim Keller,\n\n23:11.440 --> 23:14.440\n who's somebody that worked with you as a friend.\n\n23:14.440 --> 23:17.760\n Jim was, yeah, did great work at Tesla.\n\n23:17.760 --> 23:20.480\n So I suppose he carries the flame\n\n23:20.480 --> 23:22.680\n with the same kind of thinking\n\n23:22.680 --> 23:24.560\n that you're talking about now.\n\n23:26.240 --> 23:27.880\n And I guess I see that same thing\n\n23:27.880 --> 23:31.800\n at Tesla and SpaceX folks who work there,\n\n23:31.800 --> 23:33.760\n they kind of learn this way of thinking\n\n23:33.760 --> 23:36.720\n and it kind of becomes obvious almost.\n\n23:36.720 --> 23:39.680\n But anyway, I had argument, not argument,\n\n23:39.680 --> 23:44.680\n but he educated me about how cheap it might be\n\n23:44.800 --> 23:46.600\n to manufacture a Tesla bot.\n\n23:46.600 --> 23:48.360\n We just, we had an argument.\n\n23:48.360 --> 23:52.120\n How can you reduce the cost of scale of producing a robot?\n\n23:52.120 --> 23:55.960\n Because I've gotten the chance to interact quite a bit,\n\n23:55.960 --> 23:59.480\n obviously, in the academic circles with humanoid robots\n\n23:59.480 --> 24:01.800\n and then Boston Dynamics and stuff like that.\n\n24:01.800 --> 24:04.520\n And they're very expensive to build.\n\n24:04.520 --> 24:07.600\n And then Jim kind of schooled me on saying like,\n\n24:07.600 --> 24:10.080\n okay, like this kind of first principles thinking\n\n24:10.080 --> 24:12.640\n of how can we get the cost of manufacturing down?\n\n24:13.760 --> 24:14.720\n I suppose you do that,\n\n24:14.720 --> 24:17.640\n you have done that kind of thinking for Tesla bot\n\n24:17.640 --> 24:21.880\n and for all kinds of complex systems\n\n24:21.880 --> 24:23.680\n that are traditionally seen as complex.\n\n24:23.680 --> 24:26.280\n And you say, okay, how can we simplify everything down?\n\n24:27.160 --> 24:30.320\n Yeah, I mean, I think if you are really good\n\n24:30.320 --> 24:34.640\n at manufacturing, you can basically make,\n\n24:34.640 --> 24:36.560\n at high volume, you can basically make anything\n\n24:36.560 --> 24:40.640\n for a cost that asymptotically approaches\n\n24:40.640 --> 24:42.880\n the raw material value of the constituents\n\n24:42.880 --> 24:46.480\n plus any intellectual property that you need to do license.\n\n24:46.480 --> 24:47.320\n Anything.\n\n24:49.440 --> 24:50.280\n But it's hard.\n\n24:50.280 --> 24:51.840\n It's not like that's a very hard thing to do,\n\n24:51.840 --> 24:54.720\n but it is possible for anything.\n\n24:54.720 --> 24:57.480\n Anything in volume can be made, like I said,\n\n24:57.480 --> 25:00.440\n for a cost that asymptotically approaches\n\n25:00.440 --> 25:02.760\n this raw material constituents\n\n25:02.760 --> 25:05.360\n plus intellectual property license rights.\n\n25:05.360 --> 25:08.520\n So what'll often happen in trying to design a product\n\n25:08.520 --> 25:11.960\n is people will start with the tools and parts\n\n25:11.960 --> 25:14.520\n and methods that they are familiar with\n\n25:14.520 --> 25:17.480\n and then try to create the product\n\n25:17.480 --> 25:19.560\n using their existing tools and methods.\n\n25:21.240 --> 25:25.080\n The other way to think about it is actually imagine the,\n\n25:25.080 --> 25:28.800\n try to imagine the platonic ideal of the perfect product\n\n25:28.800 --> 25:31.360\n or technology, whatever it might be.\n\n25:31.360 --> 25:35.680\n And say, what is the perfect arrangement of atoms\n\n25:35.680 --> 25:38.560\n that would be the best possible product?\n\n25:38.560 --> 25:39.840\n And now let us try to figure out\n\n25:39.840 --> 25:41.540\n how to get the atoms in that shape.\n\n25:43.880 --> 25:45.600\n I mean, it sounds,\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.400\n it's almost like a Rick and Morty absurd\n\n25:50.400 --> 25:52.080\n until you start to really think about it\n\n25:52.080 --> 25:56.440\n and you really should think about it in this way\n\n25:56.440 --> 25:59.000\n because everything else is kind of,\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:03.000\n if you think, you might fall victim to the momentum\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:04.440\n of the way things were done in the past\n\n26:04.440 --> 26:06.000\n unless you think in this way.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:07.680\n Well, just as a function of inertia,\n\n26:07.680 --> 26:10.640\n people will want to use the same tools and methods\n\n26:10.640 --> 26:12.040\n that they are familiar with.\n\n26:13.720 --> 26:15.720\n That's what they'll do by default.\n\n26:15.720 --> 26:18.720\n And then that will lead to an outcome of things\n\n26:18.720 --> 26:20.480\n that can be made with those tools and methods\n\n26:20.480 --> 26:23.880\n but is unlikely to be the platonic ideal\n\n26:23.880 --> 26:25.040\n of the perfect product.\n\n26:25.040 --> 26:28.360\n So then, so that's why it's good to think of things\n\n26:28.360 --> 26:29.200\n in both directions.\n\n26:29.200 --> 26:31.240\n So like, what can we build with the tools that we have?\n\n26:31.240 --> 26:34.600\n But then, but also what is the perfect,\n\n26:34.600 --> 26:36.320\n the theoretical perfect product look like?\n\n26:36.320 --> 26:38.600\n And that theoretical perfect part\n\n26:38.600 --> 26:39.560\n is gonna be a moving target\n\n26:39.560 --> 26:41.720\n because as you learn more,\n\n26:41.720 --> 26:45.960\n the definition of that perfect product will change\n\n26:45.960 --> 26:47.720\n because you don't actually know what the perfect product is,\n\n26:47.720 --> 26:52.120\n but you can successfully approximate a more perfect product.\n\n26:52.120 --> 26:54.520\n So think about it like that and then saying,\n\n26:54.520 --> 26:57.320\n okay, now what tools, methods, materials,\n\n26:57.320 --> 27:00.400\n whatever do we need to create\n\n27:00.400 --> 27:02.360\n in order to get the atoms in that shape?\n\n27:03.880 --> 27:07.880\n But people rarely think about it that way.\n\n27:07.880 --> 27:09.440\n But it's a powerful tool.\n\n27:10.480 --> 27:13.840\n I should mention that the brilliant Siobhan Ziles\n\n27:13.840 --> 27:17.840\n is hanging out with us in case you hear a voice\n\n27:17.840 --> 27:22.840\n of wisdom from outside, from up above.\n\n27:23.720 --> 27:26.320\n Okay, so let me ask you about Mars.\n\n27:26.320 --> 27:28.520\n You mentioned it would be great for science\n\n27:28.520 --> 27:32.960\n to put a base on the moon to do some research.\n\n27:32.960 --> 27:36.760\n But the truly big leap, again,\n\n27:36.760 --> 27:38.920\n in this category of seemingly impossible,\n\n27:38.920 --> 27:41.880\n is to put a human being on Mars.\n\n27:41.880 --> 27:44.920\n When do you think SpaceX will land a human being on Mars?\n\n27:44.920 --> 27:49.920\n Hmm, best case is about five years, worst case, 10 years.\n\n27:54.480 --> 27:57.480\n Okay, so I'm gonna ask you about Mars.\n\n27:57.480 --> 28:00.480\n You mentioned it would be great for science\n\n28:00.480 --> 28:03.480\n to put a base on the moon to do some research.\n\n28:03.480 --> 28:05.680\n But the truly big leap, again,\n\n28:05.680 --> 28:08.760\n in this category of seemingly impossible,\n\n28:08.760 --> 28:11.240\n is to put a human being on Mars.\n\n28:11.240 --> 28:15.040\n But the truly big leap, again,\n\n28:15.040 --> 28:18.040\n in this category of seemingly impossible,\n\n28:18.040 --> 28:20.480\n is to put a human being on Mars.\n\n28:20.480 --> 28:23.480\n When do you think SpaceX will land a human being on Mars?\n\n28:23.480 --> 28:28.480\n Hmm, best case is about five years, worst case, 10 years.\n\n28:31.760 --> 28:34.520\n What are the determining factors, would you say,\n\n28:34.520 --> 28:36.240\n from an engineering perspective?\n\n28:36.240 --> 28:37.840\n Or is that not the bottlenecks?\n\n28:37.840 --> 28:40.760\n I don't know, order of magnitude or something like that.\n\n28:40.760 --> 28:43.000\n It's a lot, it's really next level.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:48.000\n So, and the fundamental optimization of Starship\n\n28:49.200 --> 28:51.480\n is minimizing cost per ton to orbit,\n\n28:51.480 --> 28:54.760\n and ultimately cost per ton to the surface of Mars.\n\n28:54.760 --> 28:56.320\n This may seem like a mercantile objective,\n\n28:56.320 --> 28:59.240\n but it is actually the thing that needs to be optimized.\n\n29:00.320 --> 29:04.000\n Like there is a certain cost per ton to the surface of Mars\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:07.920\n where we can afford to establish a self sustaining city,\n\n29:08.800 --> 29:11.560\n and then above that, we cannot afford to do it.\n\n29:12.760 --> 29:16.760\n So right now, you couldn't fly to Mars for a trillion dollars.\n\n29:16.760 --> 29:19.120\n No amount of money could get you a ticket to Mars.\n\n29:19.120 --> 29:21.520\n So we need to get that above,\n\n29:22.440 --> 29:25.360\n to get that something that is actually possible at all.\n\n29:27.760 --> 29:32.240\n But that's, we don't just want to have,\n\n29:32.240 --> 29:33.800\n with Mars, flags and footprints,\n\n29:33.800 --> 29:35.880\n and then not come back for a half century,\n\n29:35.880 --> 29:37.920\n like we did with the Moon.\n\n29:37.920 --> 29:42.920\n In order to pass a very important, great filter,\n\n29:43.360 --> 29:45.680\n I think we need to be a multi planet species.\n\n29:48.320 --> 29:51.400\n This may sound somewhat esoteric to a lot of people,\n\n29:51.400 --> 29:55.680\n but eventually, given enough time,\n\n29:57.160 --> 30:00.480\n there's something, Earth is likely to experience\n\n30:00.480 --> 30:05.200\n some calamity that could be something\n\n30:05.200 --> 30:06.720\n that humans do to themselves,\n\n30:06.720 --> 30:09.400\n or an external event like happened to the dinosaurs.\n\n30:12.680 --> 30:17.680\n But eventually, if none of that happens,\n\n30:17.920 --> 30:21.240\n and somehow magically we keep going,\n\n30:21.240 --> 30:24.520\n then the Sun is gradually expanding,\n\n30:24.520 --> 30:26.600\n and will engulf the Earth,\n\n30:26.600 --> 30:31.080\n and probably Earth gets too hot for life\n\n30:31.080 --> 30:34.800\n in about 500 million years.\n\n30:34.800 --> 30:37.280\n It's a long time, but that's only 10% longer\n\n30:37.280 --> 30:39.360\n than Earth has been around.\n\n30:39.360 --> 30:43.240\n And so if you think about the current situation,\n\n30:43.240 --> 30:45.640\n it's really remarkable, and kind of hard to believe,\n\n30:45.640 --> 30:50.120\n but Earth's been around four and a half billion years,\n\n30:50.120 --> 30:52.360\n and this is the first time in four and a half billion years\n\n30:52.360 --> 30:55.720\n that it's been possible to extend life beyond Earth.\n\n30:55.720 --> 30:58.120\n And that window of opportunity may be open\n\n30:58.120 --> 30:59.520\n for a long time, and I hope it is,\n\n30:59.520 --> 31:01.740\n but it also may be open for a short time.\n\n31:01.740 --> 31:06.740\n And I think it is wise for us to act quickly\n\n31:09.440 --> 31:13.800\n while the window is open, just in case it closes.\n\n31:13.800 --> 31:17.800\n Yeah, the existence of nuclear weapons, pandemics,\n\n31:17.800 --> 31:22.800\n all kinds of threats should kind of give us some motivation.\n\n31:22.800 --> 31:27.800\n I mean, civilization could die with a bang or a whimper.\n\n31:29.560 --> 31:32.760\n If it dies as a demographic collapse,\n\n31:32.760 --> 31:35.160\n then it's more of a whimper, obviously.\n\n31:35.160 --> 31:38.480\n And if it's World War III, it's more of a bang.\n\n31:38.480 --> 31:40.040\n But these are all risks.\n\n31:41.160 --> 31:42.000\n I mean, it's important to think of these things\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:46.240\n and just think of things like probabilities, not certainties.\n\n31:46.240 --> 31:47.680\n There's a certain probability\n\n31:47.680 --> 31:50.200\n that something bad will happen on Earth.\n\n31:50.200 --> 31:53.200\n I think most likely the future will be good.\n\n31:53.200 --> 31:56.400\n But there's like, let's say for argument's sake,\n\n31:56.400 --> 32:00.920\n a 1% chance per century of a civilization ending event.\n\n32:00.920 --> 32:03.080\n Like that was Stephen Hawking's estimate.\n\n32:05.080 --> 32:07.720\n I think he might be right about that.\n\n32:07.720 --> 32:12.720\n So then we should basically think of this\n\n32:15.440 --> 32:16.760\n being a multi planet species,\n\n32:16.760 --> 32:18.600\n just like taking out a planet from the sky,\n\n32:18.600 --> 32:20.720\n multi planet species, just like taking out insurance\n\n32:20.720 --> 32:21.560\n for life itself.\n\n32:21.560 --> 32:23.280\n Like life insurance for life.\n\n32:27.280 --> 32:29.360\n It's turned into an infomercial real quick.\n\n32:29.360 --> 32:31.600\n Life insurance for life, yes.\n\n32:31.600 --> 32:36.240\n And we can bring the creatures from,\n\n32:36.240 --> 32:38.040\n plants and animals from Earth to Mars\n\n32:38.040 --> 32:39.440\n and breathe life into the planet\n\n32:41.280 --> 32:43.720\n and have a second planet with life.\n\n32:44.640 --> 32:46.000\n That would be great.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:47.560\n They can't bring themselves there.\n\n32:47.560 --> 32:50.000\n So if we don't bring them to Mars,\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.280\n then they will just for sure all die\n\n32:52.280 --> 32:54.320\n when the sun expands anyway.\n\n32:54.320 --> 32:56.200\n And then that'll be it.\n\n32:56.200 --> 32:58.560\n What do you think is the most difficult aspect\n\n32:58.560 --> 33:00.960\n of building a civilization on Mars?\n\n33:00.960 --> 33:03.760\n Terraforming Mars, like from an engineering perspective,\n\n33:03.760 --> 33:07.240\n from a financial perspective, human perspective,\n\n33:07.240 --> 33:12.240\n to get a large number of folks there\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.880\n who will never return back to Earth?\n\n33:15.880 --> 33:17.160\n No, they could certainly return.\n\n33:17.160 --> 33:18.440\n Some will return back to Earth.\n\n33:18.440 --> 33:19.960\n They will choose to stay there\n\n33:19.960 --> 33:21.280\n for the rest of their lives.\n\n33:21.280 --> 33:22.160\n Yeah, many will.\n\n33:23.760 --> 33:28.440\n But we need the spaceships back,\n\n33:28.440 --> 33:29.480\n like the ones that go to Mars.\n\n33:29.480 --> 33:30.320\n We need them back.\n\n33:30.320 --> 33:32.680\n So you can hop on if you want.\n\n33:32.680 --> 33:34.960\n But we can't just not have the spaceships come back.\n\n33:34.960 --> 33:35.800\n Those things are expensive.\n\n33:35.800 --> 33:36.640\n We need them back.\n\n33:36.640 --> 33:38.760\n I'd like to come back and do another trip.\n\n33:38.760 --> 33:40.680\n I mean, do you think about the terraforming aspect,\n\n33:40.680 --> 33:41.640\n like actually building?\n\n33:41.640 --> 33:44.560\n Are you so focused right now on the spaceships part\n\n33:44.560 --> 33:46.960\n that's so critical to get to Mars?\n\n33:46.960 --> 33:48.200\n We absolutely, if you can't get there,\n\n33:48.200 --> 33:49.600\n nothing else matters.\n\n33:49.600 --> 33:53.040\n So, and like I said, we can't get there\n\n33:53.040 --> 33:54.680\n at some extraordinarily high cost.\n\n33:54.680 --> 33:57.800\n I mean, the current cost of, let's say,\n\n33:57.800 --> 34:00.080\n one ton to the surface of Mars\n\n34:00.080 --> 34:02.680\n is on the order of a billion dollars.\n\n34:02.680 --> 34:04.840\n So, because you don't just need the rocket\n\n34:04.840 --> 34:05.680\n and the launch and everything,\n\n34:05.680 --> 34:09.840\n you need like heat shield, you need guidance system,\n\n34:09.840 --> 34:12.280\n you need deep space communications,\n\n34:12.280 --> 34:15.000\n you need some kind of landing system.\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:19.520\n So, like rough approximation would be a billion dollars\n\n34:19.520 --> 34:22.200\n per ton to the surface of Mars right now.\n\n34:22.200 --> 34:26.880\n This is obviously way too expensive\n\n34:26.880 --> 34:29.060\n to create a self sustaining civilization.\n\n34:30.680 --> 34:35.680\n So we need to improve that by at least a factor of 1,000.\n\n34:36.840 --> 34:38.440\n A million per ton?\n\n34:38.440 --> 34:40.880\n Yes, ideally much less than a million ton.\n\n34:40.880 --> 34:44.280\n But if it's not, like it's gotta be,\n\n34:44.280 --> 34:45.200\n so you have to say like, well,\n\n34:45.200 --> 34:47.960\n how much can society afford to spend\n\n34:47.960 --> 34:52.400\n or just want to spend on a self sustaining city on Mars?\n\n34:52.400 --> 34:53.780\n The self sustaining part is important.\n\n34:53.780 --> 34:56.240\n Like it's just the key threshold,\n\n34:57.720 --> 35:01.360\n the great filter will have been passed\n\n35:01.360 --> 35:05.280\n when the city on Mars can survive\n\n35:05.280 --> 35:07.720\n even if the spaceships from Earth stop coming\n\n35:07.720 --> 35:09.960\n for any reason, doesn't matter what the reason is,\n\n35:09.960 --> 35:12.120\n but if they stop coming for any reason,\n\n35:12.120 --> 35:13.720\n will it die out or will it not?\n\n35:13.720 --> 35:16.400\n And if there's even one critical ingredient missing,\n\n35:16.400 --> 35:18.320\n then it still doesn't count.\n\n35:18.320 --> 35:20.440\n It's like, you know, if you're on a long sea voyage\n\n35:20.440 --> 35:22.520\n and you've got everything except vitamin C,\n\n35:23.920 --> 35:26.280\n it's only a matter of time, you know, you're gonna die.\n\n35:26.280 --> 35:28.880\n So we're gonna get a Mars city\n\n35:28.880 --> 35:30.840\n to the point where it's self sustaining.\n\n35:32.260 --> 35:33.880\n I'm not sure this will really happen in my lifetime,\n\n35:33.880 --> 35:37.320\n but I hope to see it at least have a lot of momentum.\n\n35:37.320 --> 35:38.520\n And then you could say, okay,\n\n35:38.520 --> 35:40.380\n what is the minimum tonnage necessary\n\n35:40.380 --> 35:44.060\n to have a self sustaining city?\n\n35:44.060 --> 35:46.480\n And there's a lot of uncertainty about this.\n\n35:46.480 --> 35:48.560\n You could say like, I don't know,\n\n35:48.560 --> 35:50.440\n it's probably at least a million tons\n\n35:52.040 --> 35:55.440\n cause you have to set up a lot of infrastructure on Mars.\n\n35:55.440 --> 35:58.680\n Like I said, you can't be missing anything\n\n35:58.680 --> 36:00.960\n that in order to be self sustaining,\n\n36:00.960 --> 36:02.420\n you can't be missing, like you need,\n\n36:02.420 --> 36:07.120\n you know, semiconductor, fabs, you need iron ore refineries,\n\n36:07.120 --> 36:09.360\n like you need lots of things, you know.\n\n36:09.360 --> 36:13.640\n So, and Mars is not super hospitable.\n\n36:13.640 --> 36:15.680\n It's the least inhospitable planet,\n\n36:15.680 --> 36:18.120\n but it's definitely a fixer of a planet.\n\n36:18.120 --> 36:19.360\n Outside of Earth.\n\n36:19.360 --> 36:20.200\n Yes.\n\n36:20.200 --> 36:21.020\n Earth is pretty good.\n\n36:21.020 --> 36:22.280\n Earth is like easy, yeah.\n\n36:22.280 --> 36:25.480\n And also I should, we should clarify in the solar system.\n\n36:25.480 --> 36:26.600\n Yes, in the solar system.\n\n36:26.600 --> 36:29.760\n There might be nice like vacation spots.\n\n36:29.760 --> 36:31.160\n There might be some great planets out there,\n\n36:31.160 --> 36:32.760\n but it's hopeless.\n\n36:32.760 --> 36:33.800\n Too hard to get there?\n\n36:33.800 --> 36:37.440\n Yeah, way, way, way, way, way too hard to say the least.\n\n36:37.440 --> 36:39.720\n Let me push back on that, not really a push back,\n\n36:39.720 --> 36:42.000\n but a quick curve ball of a question.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.840\n So you did mention physics as the first starting point.\n\n36:44.840 --> 36:49.840\n So, general relativity allows for wormholes.\n\n36:51.400 --> 36:53.080\n They technically can exist.\n\n36:53.080 --> 36:55.720\n Do you think those can ever be leveraged\n\n36:55.720 --> 36:58.080\n by humans to travel fast in the speed of light?\n\n36:59.400 --> 37:03.600\n Well, the wormhole thing is debatable.\n\n37:03.600 --> 37:08.200\n The, we currently do not know of any means\n\n37:08.200 --> 37:10.200\n of going faster than the speed of light.\n\n37:11.760 --> 37:16.760\n There is like, there are some ideas about having space.\n\n37:21.400 --> 37:26.400\n Like so, you can only move at the speed of light\n\n37:26.520 --> 37:30.740\n through space, but if you can make space itself move,\n\n37:30.740 --> 37:34.520\n that's like, that's warping space.\n\n37:36.140 --> 37:39.580\n Space is capable of moving faster than the speed of light.\n\n37:39.580 --> 37:40.740\n Right.\n\n37:40.740 --> 37:42.100\n Like the universe in the Big Bang,\n\n37:42.100 --> 37:44.180\n the universe expanded at much,\n\n37:44.180 --> 37:46.820\n much more than the speed of light by a lot.\n\n37:46.820 --> 37:47.660\n Yeah.\n\n37:48.820 --> 37:53.820\n So, but the, if this is possible,\n\n37:56.380 --> 37:58.660\n the amount of energy required to warp space\n\n37:58.660 --> 38:03.100\n is so gigantic, it boggles the mind.\n\n38:03.100 --> 38:05.060\n So all the work you've done with propulsion,\n\n38:05.060 --> 38:08.100\n how much innovation is possible with rocket propulsion?\n\n38:08.100 --> 38:11.140\n Is this, I mean, you've seen it all,\n\n38:11.140 --> 38:13.540\n and you're constantly innovating in every aspect.\n\n38:14.420 --> 38:15.340\n How much is possible?\n\n38:15.340 --> 38:17.380\n Like how much, can you get 10x somehow?\n\n38:17.380 --> 38:19.660\n Is there something in there in physics\n\n38:19.660 --> 38:21.260\n that you can get significant improvement\n\n38:21.260 --> 38:22.620\n in terms of efficiency of engines\n\n38:22.620 --> 38:24.640\n and all those kinds of things?\n\n38:24.640 --> 38:27.940\n Well, as I was saying, really the Holy Grail\n\n38:27.940 --> 38:31.500\n is a fully and rapidly reusable orbital system.\n\n38:33.020 --> 38:38.020\n So right now, the Falcon 9\n\n38:38.100 --> 38:41.460\n is the only reusable rocket out there,\n\n38:41.460 --> 38:44.300\n but the booster comes back and lands,\n\n38:44.300 --> 38:46.180\n and you've seen the videos,\n\n38:46.180 --> 38:47.620\n and we get the nose cone fairing back,\n\n38:47.620 --> 38:49.740\n but we do not get the upper stage back.\n\n38:49.740 --> 38:54.260\n So that means that we have a minimum cost\n\n38:54.260 --> 38:56.660\n of building an upper stage.\n\n38:56.660 --> 38:59.300\n And you can think of like a two stage rocket\n\n38:59.300 --> 39:00.700\n of sort of like two airplanes,\n\n39:00.700 --> 39:03.180\n like a big airplane and a small airplane.\n\n39:03.180 --> 39:04.600\n And we get the big airplane back,\n\n39:04.600 --> 39:05.860\n but not the small airplane.\n\n39:05.860 --> 39:07.860\n And so it still costs a lot.\n\n39:07.860 --> 39:11.300\n So that upper stage is at least $10 million.\n\n39:13.300 --> 39:15.460\n And then the degree of,\n\n39:15.460 --> 39:19.060\n the booster is not as rapidly and completely reusable\n\n39:19.060 --> 39:20.900\n as we'd like in order of the fairings.\n\n39:20.900 --> 39:25.180\n So our kind of minimum marginal cost\n\n39:25.180 --> 39:27.180\n and our counting overhead for per flight\n\n39:27.180 --> 39:32.180\n is on the order of 15 to $20 million, maybe.\n\n39:33.400 --> 39:38.060\n So that's extremely good for,\n\n39:38.060 --> 39:40.660\n it's by far better than any rocket ever in history.\n\n39:41.660 --> 39:45.380\n But with full and rapid reusability,\n\n39:45.380 --> 39:48.840\n we can reduce the cost per ton to orbit\n\n39:48.840 --> 39:51.880\n by a factor of 100.\n\n39:51.880 --> 39:54.200\n But just think of it like,\n\n39:54.200 --> 39:58.800\n like imagine if you had an aircraft or something or a car.\n\n39:58.800 --> 40:02.920\n And if you had to buy a new car\n\n40:02.920 --> 40:05.080\n every time you went for a drive,\n\n40:05.080 --> 40:06.760\n that would be very expensive.\n\n40:06.760 --> 40:08.320\n It'd be silly, frankly.\n\n40:08.320 --> 40:13.320\n But in fact, you just refuel the car or recharge the car.\n\n40:13.480 --> 40:18.480\n And that makes your trip like,\n\n40:18.480 --> 40:20.320\n I don't know, a thousand times cheaper.\n\n40:20.320 --> 40:23.800\n So it's the same for rockets.\n\n40:23.800 --> 40:27.240\n If you, it's very difficult to make this complex machine\n\n40:27.240 --> 40:28.680\n that can go to orbit.\n\n40:28.680 --> 40:30.560\n And so if you cannot reuse it\n\n40:30.560 --> 40:32.800\n and have to throw even any part of,\n\n40:32.800 --> 40:34.000\n any significant part of it away,\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:36.640\n that massively increases the cost.\n\n40:36.640 --> 40:40.320\n So, you know, Starship in theory\n\n40:40.320 --> 40:44.360\n could do a cost per launch of like a million,\n\n40:44.360 --> 40:46.400\n maybe $2 million or something like that.\n\n40:46.400 --> 40:51.400\n And put over a hundred tons in orbit, which is crazy.\n\n40:53.560 --> 40:55.960\n Yeah, that's incredible.\n\n40:55.960 --> 40:58.200\n So you're saying like it's by far the biggest bang\n\n40:58.200 --> 41:00.720\n for the buck is to make it fully reusable\n\n41:00.720 --> 41:04.160\n versus like some kind of brilliant breakthrough\n\n41:04.160 --> 41:05.760\n in theoretical physics.\n\n41:05.760 --> 41:07.680\n No, no, there's no, there's no brilliant break.\n\n41:07.680 --> 41:11.240\n No, there's no, just make the rocket reusable.\n\n41:11.240 --> 41:13.520\n This is an extremely difficult engineering problem.\n\n41:13.520 --> 41:14.360\n Got it.\n\n41:14.360 --> 41:17.960\n No new physics is required.\n\n41:17.960 --> 41:19.320\n Just brilliant engineering.\n\n41:19.320 --> 41:22.200\n Let me ask a slightly philosophical fun question.\n\n41:22.200 --> 41:24.840\n Gotta ask, I know you're focused on getting to Mars,\n\n41:24.840 --> 41:27.240\n but once we're there on Mars, what do you,\n\n41:27.240 --> 41:32.240\n what form of government, economic system, political system\n\n41:32.360 --> 41:33.760\n do you think would work best\n\n41:33.760 --> 41:37.200\n for an early civilization of humans?\n\n41:37.200 --> 41:41.560\n Is, I mean, the interesting reason to talk about this stuff,\n\n41:41.560 --> 41:44.320\n it also helps people dream about the future.\n\n41:44.320 --> 41:45.560\n I know you're really focused\n\n41:45.560 --> 41:48.040\n about the short term engineering dream,\n\n41:48.040 --> 41:49.320\n but it's like, I don't know,\n\n41:49.320 --> 41:51.840\n there's something about imagining an actual civilization\n\n41:51.840 --> 41:55.440\n on Mars that gives people, really gives people hope.\n\n41:55.440 --> 41:57.680\n Well, it would be a new frontier and an opportunity\n\n41:57.680 --> 41:59.640\n to rethink the whole nature of government,\n\n41:59.640 --> 42:02.680\n just as was done in the creation of the United States.\n\n42:02.680 --> 42:14.680\n So, I mean, I would suggest having a direct democracy,\n\n42:14.680 --> 42:16.200\n people vote directly on things\n\n42:16.200 --> 42:18.440\n as opposed to representative democracy.\n\n42:18.440 --> 42:21.520\n So representative democracy, I think,\n\n42:21.520 --> 42:25.120\n is too subject to a special interest\n\n42:25.120 --> 42:29.580\n and a coercion of the politicians and that kind of thing.\n\n42:29.580 --> 42:34.580\n So I'd recommend that there was just direct democracy,\n\n42:39.360 --> 42:42.680\n people vote on laws, the population votes on laws themselves,\n\n42:42.680 --> 42:44.520\n and then the laws must be short enough\n\n42:44.520 --> 42:46.880\n that people can understand them.\n\n42:46.880 --> 42:49.920\n Yeah, and then like keeping a well informed populace,\n\n42:49.920 --> 42:52.240\n like really being transparent about all the information,\n\n42:52.240 --> 42:53.080\n about what they're voting for.\n\n42:53.080 --> 42:54.800\n Yeah, absolute transparency.\n\n42:54.800 --> 42:57.480\n Yeah, and not make it as annoying as those cookies\n\n42:57.480 --> 42:59.920\n we have to accept. Accept cookies.\n\n42:59.920 --> 43:01.760\n I've always, like, you know,\n\n43:01.760 --> 43:03.640\n there's like always like a slight amount of trepidation\n\n43:03.640 --> 43:05.360\n when you click accept cookies,\n\n43:05.360 --> 43:07.280\n like I feel as though there's like perhaps\n\n43:07.280 --> 43:10.680\n like a very tiny chance that it'll open a portal to hell\n\n43:10.680 --> 43:12.320\n or something like that.\n\n43:12.320 --> 43:13.800\n That's exactly how I feel.\n\n43:13.800 --> 43:16.640\n Why do they, why do they keep wanting me to accept it?\n\n43:16.640 --> 43:19.000\n What do they want with this cookie?\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.020\n Like somebody got upset with accepting cookies\n\n43:21.020 --> 43:23.040\n or something somewhere, who cares?\n\n43:23.040 --> 43:26.920\n Like so annoying to keep accepting all these cookies.\n\n43:26.920 --> 43:29.600\n To me, this is just a great example.\n\n43:29.600 --> 43:30.720\n Yes, you can have my damn cookie.\n\n43:30.720 --> 43:32.360\n I don't care, whatever.\n\n43:32.360 --> 43:33.720\n Heard it from Ilhan first.\n\n43:33.720 --> 43:35.960\n He accepts all your damn cookies.\n\n43:35.960 --> 43:38.920\n Yeah, and stop asking me.\n\n43:40.240 --> 43:41.400\n It's annoying.\n\n43:41.400 --> 43:46.000\n Yeah, it's one example of implementation\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:50.200\n of a good idea done really horribly.\n\n43:50.200 --> 43:51.480\n Yeah, it's somebody who was like,\n\n43:51.480 --> 43:54.920\n there's some good intentions of like privacy or whatever,\n\n43:54.920 --> 43:57.320\n but now everyone's just has to accept cookies\n\n43:57.320 --> 43:59.360\n and it's not, you know, you have billions of people\n\n43:59.360 --> 44:00.720\n who have to keep clicking accept cookie.\n\n44:00.720 --> 44:02.440\n It's super annoying.\n\n44:02.440 --> 44:05.000\n Then we just accept the damn cookie, it's fine.\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:08.660\n There is like, I think a fundamental problem that we're,\n\n44:08.660 --> 44:11.300\n because we've not really had a major,\n\n44:12.320 --> 44:14.360\n like a world war or something like that in a while.\n\n44:14.360 --> 44:16.920\n And obviously we would like to not have world wars.\n\n44:18.320 --> 44:19.840\n There's not been a cleansing function\n\n44:19.840 --> 44:21.420\n for rules and regulations.\n\n44:21.420 --> 44:24.340\n So wars did have, you know, some sort of aligning\n\n44:24.340 --> 44:27.580\n in that there would be a reset on rules\n\n44:27.580 --> 44:29.660\n and regulations after a war.\n\n44:29.660 --> 44:30.500\n So World Wars I and II,\n\n44:30.500 --> 44:32.980\n there were huge resets on rules and regulations.\n\n44:34.260 --> 44:37.900\n Now, if society does not have a war\n\n44:37.900 --> 44:39.460\n and there's no cleansing function\n\n44:39.460 --> 44:41.420\n or garbage collection for rules and regulations,\n\n44:41.420 --> 44:43.500\n then rules and regulations will accumulate every year\n\n44:43.500 --> 44:45.020\n because they're immortal.\n\n44:45.020 --> 44:48.580\n There's no actual, humans die, but the laws don't.\n\n44:48.580 --> 44:51.660\n So we need a garbage collection function\n\n44:51.660 --> 44:52.980\n for rules and regulations.\n\n44:52.980 --> 44:55.660\n They should not just be immortal\n\n44:55.660 --> 44:57.340\n because some of the rules and regulations\n\n44:57.340 --> 45:00.260\n that are put in place will be counterproductive,\n\n45:00.260 --> 45:02.140\n done with good intentions, but counterproductive.\n\n45:02.140 --> 45:03.940\n Sometimes not done with good intentions.\n\n45:03.940 --> 45:08.940\n So if rules and regulations just accumulate every year\n\n45:09.100 --> 45:10.740\n and you get more and more of them,\n\n45:10.740 --> 45:13.220\n then eventually you won't be able to do anything.\n\n45:13.220 --> 45:15.180\n You're just like Gulliver with, you know,\n\n45:15.180 --> 45:17.420\n tied down by thousands of little structures\n\n45:17.420 --> 45:19.620\n by thousands of little strings.\n\n45:19.620 --> 45:24.620\n And we see that in, you know, US and like basically\n\n45:26.460 --> 45:30.300\n all economies that have been around for a while\n\n45:31.460 --> 45:35.340\n and regulators and legislators create new rules\n\n45:35.340 --> 45:36.580\n and regulations every year,\n\n45:36.580 --> 45:38.740\n but they don't put effort into removing them.\n\n45:38.740 --> 45:40.300\n And I think that's very important that we put effort\n\n45:40.300 --> 45:42.100\n into removing rules and regulations.\n\n45:44.020 --> 45:45.620\n But it gets tough because you get special interests\n\n45:45.620 --> 45:48.900\n that then are dependent on, like they have, you know,\n\n45:48.900 --> 45:51.940\n a vested interest in that whatever rule and regulation\n\n45:51.940 --> 45:55.620\n and then they fight to not get it removed.\n\n45:57.620 --> 46:00.940\n Yeah, so I mean, I guess the problem with the constitution\n\n46:00.940 --> 46:04.140\n is it's kind of like C versus Java\n\n46:04.140 --> 46:06.740\n because it doesn't have any garbage collection built in.\n\n46:06.740 --> 46:09.020\n I think there should be, when you first said\n\n46:09.020 --> 46:10.860\n the metaphor of garbage collection, I loved it.\n\n46:10.860 --> 46:12.380\n Yeah, from a coding standpoint.\n\n46:12.380 --> 46:14.340\n From a coding standpoint, yeah, yeah.\n\n46:14.340 --> 46:16.900\n It would be interesting if the laws themselves\n\n46:16.900 --> 46:19.020\n kind of had a built in thing\n\n46:19.020 --> 46:20.700\n where they kind of die after a while\n\n46:20.700 --> 46:23.660\n unless somebody explicitly publicly defends them.\n\n46:23.660 --> 46:26.220\n So that's sort of, it's not like somebody has to kill them.\n\n46:26.220 --> 46:28.100\n They kind of die themselves.\n\n46:28.100 --> 46:29.180\n They disappear.\n\n46:29.180 --> 46:30.020\n Yeah.\n\n46:32.540 --> 46:36.220\n Not to defend Java or anything, but you know, C++,\n\n46:36.220 --> 46:38.540\n you know, you could also have a great garbage collection\n\n46:38.540 --> 46:39.940\n in Python and so on.\n\n46:39.940 --> 46:43.740\n Yeah, so yeah, something needs to happen\n\n46:43.740 --> 46:48.580\n or just the civilization's arteries just harden over time\n\n46:48.580 --> 46:50.820\n and you can just get less and less done\n\n46:50.820 --> 46:53.220\n because there's just a rule against everything.\n\n46:54.820 --> 46:57.900\n So I think like, I don't know, for Mars or whatever,\n\n46:57.900 --> 47:00.260\n I'd say, or even for, you know, obviously for Earth as well,\n\n47:00.260 --> 47:02.620\n like I think there should be an active process\n\n47:02.620 --> 47:04.940\n for removing rules and regulations\n\n47:04.940 --> 47:07.100\n and questioning their existence.\n\n47:07.100 --> 47:10.260\n Just like if we've got a function\n\n47:10.260 --> 47:11.580\n for creating rules and regulations,\n\n47:11.580 --> 47:13.140\n because rules and regulations can also think of us\n\n47:13.140 --> 47:15.780\n like they're like software or lines of code\n\n47:15.780 --> 47:18.860\n for operating civilization.\n\n47:18.860 --> 47:21.300\n That's the rules and regulations.\n\n47:21.300 --> 47:22.980\n So it's not like we shouldn't have rules and regulations,\n\n47:22.980 --> 47:27.100\n but you have code accumulation, but no code removal.\n\n47:27.100 --> 47:31.460\n And so it just gets to become basically archaic bloatware\n\n47:31.460 --> 47:32.300\n after a while.\n\n47:33.620 --> 47:37.900\n And it's just, it makes it hard for things to progress.\n\n47:37.900 --> 47:40.460\n So I don't know, maybe Mars, you'd have like,\n\n47:40.460 --> 47:44.300\n you know, any given law must have a sunset, you know,\n\n47:44.300 --> 47:49.300\n and require active voting to keep it up there, you know.\n\n47:52.140 --> 47:54.660\n And I actually also say like, and these are just,\n\n47:54.660 --> 47:57.020\n I don't know, recommendations or thoughts,\n\n47:58.260 --> 48:00.700\n ultimately will be up to the people on Mars to decide.\n\n48:00.700 --> 48:05.700\n But I think it should be easier to remove a law\n\n48:06.660 --> 48:08.620\n than to add one because of the,\n\n48:08.620 --> 48:10.700\n just to overcome the inertia of laws.\n\n48:10.700 --> 48:15.220\n So maybe it's like, for argument's sake,\n\n48:15.220 --> 48:19.780\n you need like say 60% vote to have a law take effect,\n\n48:19.780 --> 48:22.020\n but only a 40% vote to remove it.\n\n48:23.420 --> 48:26.620\n So let me be the guy, you posted a meme on Twitter recently\n\n48:26.620 --> 48:30.140\n where there's like a row of urinals,\n\n48:30.140 --> 48:33.100\n and a guy just walks all the way across,\n\n48:33.100 --> 48:34.620\n and he tells you about crypto.\n\n48:36.300 --> 48:38.340\n I mean, that's happened to me so many times.\n\n48:38.340 --> 48:40.420\n I think maybe even literally.\n\n48:40.420 --> 48:41.820\n Yeah.\n\n48:41.820 --> 48:43.500\n Do you think, technologically speaking,\n\n48:43.500 --> 48:47.340\n there's any room for ideas of smart contracts or so on?\n\n48:47.340 --> 48:49.300\n Because you mentioned laws.\n\n48:49.300 --> 48:52.980\n That's an interesting use of things like smart contracts\n\n48:52.980 --> 48:56.000\n to implement the laws by which governments function.\n\n48:57.300 --> 48:58.980\n Like something built on Ethereum,\n\n48:58.980 --> 49:03.980\n or maybe a dog coin that enables smart contracts somehow.\n\n49:04.860 --> 49:08.260\n I don't quite understand this whole smart contract thing.\n\n49:08.260 --> 49:09.100\n You know.\n\n49:09.960 --> 49:15.020\n I mean, I'm too dumb to understand smart contracts.\n\n49:15.020 --> 49:16.020\n That's a good line.\n\n49:17.900 --> 49:21.460\n I mean, my general approach to any kind of deal or whatever\n\n49:21.460 --> 49:23.780\n is just make sure there's clarity of understanding.\n\n49:23.780 --> 49:25.820\n That's the most important thing.\n\n49:25.820 --> 49:29.660\n And just keep any kind of deal very short and simple,\n\n49:29.660 --> 49:33.460\n plain language, and just make sure everyone understands\n\n49:33.460 --> 49:36.580\n this is the deal, is it clear?\n\n49:36.580 --> 49:40.660\n And what are the consequences if various things\n\n49:40.660 --> 49:41.500\n don't happen?\n\n49:42.620 --> 49:47.220\n But usually deals are, business deals or whatever,\n\n49:47.220 --> 49:50.940\n are way too long and complex and overly lawyered\n\n49:50.940 --> 49:51.880\n and pointlessly.\n\n49:52.740 --> 49:57.020\n You mentioned that Doge is the people's coin.\n\n49:57.020 --> 49:57.860\n Yeah.\n\n49:57.860 --> 49:59.660\n And you said that you were literally going,\n\n49:59.660 --> 50:04.660\n SpaceX may consider literally putting a Doge coin\n\n50:04.660 --> 50:09.660\n on the moon, is this something you're still considering?\n\n50:09.940 --> 50:13.620\n Mars, perhaps, do you think there's some chance,\n\n50:13.620 --> 50:16.060\n we've talked about political systems on Mars,\n\n50:16.060 --> 50:20.220\n that Doge coin is the official currency of Mars\n\n50:20.220 --> 50:21.580\n at some point in the future?\n\n50:22.580 --> 50:25.700\n Well, I think Mars itself will need to have\n\n50:25.700 --> 50:29.060\n a different currency because you can't synchronize\n\n50:29.060 --> 50:32.660\n due to speed of light, or not easily.\n\n50:32.660 --> 50:35.020\n So it must be completely stand alone from Earth.\n\n50:36.480 --> 50:41.340\n Well, yeah, because Mars is, at closest approach,\n\n50:41.340 --> 50:43.020\n it's four light minutes away, roughly,\n\n50:43.020 --> 50:45.580\n and then at furthest approach, it's roughly\n\n50:45.580 --> 50:48.480\n 20 light minutes away, maybe a little more.\n\n50:50.100 --> 50:52.980\n So you can't really have something synchronizing\n\n50:52.980 --> 50:55.500\n if you've got a 20 minute speed of light issue,\n\n50:55.500 --> 50:58.180\n if it's got a one minute blockchain.\n\n50:58.180 --> 50:59.980\n It's not gonna synchronize properly.\n\n50:59.980 --> 51:03.960\n So Mars, I don't know if Mars would have\n\n51:03.960 --> 51:07.640\n a cryptocurrency as a thing, but probably, seems likely.\n\n51:07.640 --> 51:10.240\n But it would be some kind of localized thing on Mars.\n\n51:12.280 --> 51:13.880\n And you let the people decide.\n\n51:14.800 --> 51:16.500\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n51:17.680 --> 51:20.720\n The future of Mars should be up to the Martians.\n\n51:20.720 --> 51:25.720\n Yeah, so, I think the cryptocurrency thing\n\n51:25.720 --> 51:30.720\n is an interesting approach to reducing\n\n51:30.800 --> 51:35.800\n the error in the database that is called money.\n\n51:41.400 --> 51:42.920\n I think I have a pretty deep understanding\n\n51:42.920 --> 51:46.720\n of what money actually is on a practical day to day basis\n\n51:46.720 --> 51:48.040\n because of PayPal.\n\n51:50.400 --> 51:52.920\n We really got in deep there.\n\n51:52.920 --> 51:57.560\n And right now, the money system, actually,\n\n51:57.560 --> 52:01.120\n for practical purposes, is really a bunch\n\n52:01.120 --> 52:05.780\n of heterogeneous mainframes running old COBOL.\n\n52:07.480 --> 52:08.720\n Okay, you mean literally.\n\n52:08.720 --> 52:10.840\n That's literally what's happening.\n\n52:10.840 --> 52:11.680\n In batch mode.\n\n52:12.760 --> 52:13.600\n Okay.\n\n52:13.600 --> 52:14.420\n In batch mode.\n\n52:14.420 --> 52:16.720\n Yeah, pretty the poor bastards who have\n\n52:16.720 --> 52:19.000\n to maintain that code.\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:22.240\n Okay, that's a pain.\n\n52:22.240 --> 52:24.240\n Not even Fortran, it's COBOL.\n\n52:24.240 --> 52:25.080\n It's COBOL.\n\n52:26.040 --> 52:30.120\n And the banks are still buying mainframes in 2021\n\n52:30.120 --> 52:32.020\n and running ancient COBOL code.\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:37.800\n And the Federal Reserve is probably even older\n\n52:37.800 --> 52:39.280\n than what the banks have, and they have\n\n52:39.280 --> 52:41.080\n an old COBOL mainframe.\n\n52:41.880 --> 52:46.880\n And so, the government effectively has editing privileges\n\n52:47.080 --> 52:48.660\n on the money database.\n\n52:48.660 --> 52:53.660\n And they use those editing privileges to make more money,\n\n52:53.740 --> 52:55.420\n whatever they want.\n\n52:55.420 --> 52:59.060\n And this increases the error in the database that is money.\n\n52:59.060 --> 53:00.820\n So, I think money should really be viewed\n\n53:00.820 --> 53:03.580\n through the lens of information theory.\n\n53:03.580 --> 53:08.300\n And so, it's kind of like an internet connection.\n\n53:08.300 --> 53:12.580\n Like what's the bandwidth, total bit rate,\n\n53:12.580 --> 53:16.420\n what is the latency, jitter, packet drop,\n\n53:16.420 --> 53:21.420\n you know, errors in network communication.\n\n53:21.820 --> 53:24.460\n Just think of money like that, basically.\n\n53:24.460 --> 53:26.460\n I think that's probably the right way to think of it.\n\n53:26.460 --> 53:31.460\n And then say what system from an information theory\n\n53:31.460 --> 53:34.380\n standpoint allows an economy to function the best.\n\n53:35.620 --> 53:40.620\n And, you know, crypto is an attempt to reduce\n\n53:40.620 --> 53:45.620\n the error in money that is contributed\n\n53:48.780 --> 53:53.300\n by governments diluting the money supply\n\n53:53.300 --> 53:57.220\n as basically a pernicious form of taxation.\n\n53:58.900 --> 54:01.900\n So, both policy in terms of with inflation\n\n54:01.900 --> 54:05.780\n and actual like technological COBOL,\n\n54:05.780 --> 54:08.880\n like cryptocurrency takes us into the 21st century\n\n54:08.880 --> 54:10.740\n in terms of the actual systems\n\n54:10.740 --> 54:12.140\n that allow you to do the transaction,\n\n54:12.140 --> 54:14.180\n to store wealth, all those kinds of things.\n\n54:16.920 --> 54:18.580\n Like I said, just think of money as information.\n\n54:18.580 --> 54:20.900\n People often will think of money\n\n54:20.900 --> 54:22.740\n as having power in and of itself.\n\n54:24.100 --> 54:24.980\n It does not.\n\n54:24.980 --> 54:28.980\n Money is information and it does not have power\n\n54:28.980 --> 54:29.900\n in and of itself.\n\n54:31.460 --> 54:35.060\n Like, you know, applying the physics tools\n\n54:35.060 --> 54:37.540\n of thinking about things in the limit is helpful.\n\n54:37.540 --> 54:39.980\n If you are stranded on a tropical island\n\n54:41.020 --> 54:45.500\n and you have a trillion dollars, it's useless\n\n54:47.660 --> 54:50.540\n because there's no resource allocation.\n\n54:50.540 --> 54:52.660\n Money is a database for resource allocation,\n\n54:52.660 --> 54:55.020\n but there's no resource to allocate except yourself.\n\n54:55.020 --> 54:56.060\n So, money is useless.\n\n55:01.020 --> 55:04.100\n If you're stranded on a desert island with no food,\n\n55:04.100 --> 55:09.100\n all the Bitcoin in the world will not stop you\n\n55:10.340 --> 55:11.180\n from starving.\n\n55:12.420 --> 55:17.420\n So, just think of money as a database\n\n55:20.820 --> 55:24.020\n for resource allocation across time and space.\n\n55:24.980 --> 55:29.980\n And then what system, in what form\n\n55:29.980 --> 55:34.980\n should that database or data system,\n\n55:37.020 --> 55:39.060\n what would be most effective?\n\n55:39.060 --> 55:41.380\n Now, there is a fundamental issue\n\n55:41.380 --> 55:44.940\n with say Bitcoin in its current form\n\n55:46.020 --> 55:48.660\n in that the transaction volume is very limited\n\n55:50.700 --> 55:55.700\n and the latency for a properly confirmed transaction\n\n55:55.700 --> 55:58.100\n is too long, much longer than you'd like.\n\n55:58.100 --> 56:02.460\n So, it's actually not great from a transaction volume\n\n56:02.460 --> 56:04.460\n standpoint or a latency standpoint.\n\n56:07.260 --> 56:12.260\n So, it is perhaps useful to solve an aspect\n\n56:12.420 --> 56:17.420\n of the money database problem, which is the sort of store\n\n56:17.420 --> 56:22.020\n of wealth or an accounting of relative obligations,\n\n56:22.020 --> 56:27.020\n I suppose, but it is not useful as a currency,\n\n56:27.500 --> 56:28.780\n as a day to day currency.\n\n56:28.780 --> 56:31.260\n But people have proposed different technological solutions.\n\n56:31.260 --> 56:32.100\n Like Lightning.\n\n56:32.100 --> 56:34.740\n Yeah, Lightning Network and the layer two technologies\n\n56:34.740 --> 56:35.580\n on top of that.\n\n56:35.580 --> 56:38.820\n I mean, it seems to be all kind of a trade off,\n\n56:38.820 --> 56:41.060\n but the point is, it's kind of brilliant to say\n\n56:41.060 --> 56:42.460\n that just think about information,\n\n56:42.460 --> 56:44.100\n think about what kind of database,\n\n56:44.100 --> 56:45.860\n what kind of infrastructure enables\n\n56:45.860 --> 56:46.700\n that exchange of information.\n\n56:46.700 --> 56:49.180\n Yeah, just say like you're operating an economy\n\n56:49.180 --> 56:54.180\n and you need to have some thing that allows\n\n56:55.260 --> 56:59.740\n for the efficient, to have efficient value ratios\n\n56:59.740 --> 57:01.380\n between products and services.\n\n57:01.380 --> 57:03.220\n So, you've got this massive number of products\n\n57:03.220 --> 57:06.380\n and services and you need to, you can't just barter.\n\n57:06.380 --> 57:09.620\n It's just like, that would be extremely unwieldy.\n\n57:09.620 --> 57:13.420\n So, you need something that gives you the ratio\n\n57:13.420 --> 57:18.420\n of exchange between goods and services.\n\n57:20.540 --> 57:22.580\n And then something that allows you\n\n57:22.580 --> 57:26.580\n to shift obligations across time, like debt.\n\n57:26.580 --> 57:29.180\n Debt and equity shift obligations across time.\n\n57:29.180 --> 57:31.340\n Then what does the best job of that?\n\n57:33.300 --> 57:36.020\n Part of the reason why I think there's some\n\n57:36.020 --> 57:38.660\n Merit Doge coin, even though it was obviously created\n\n57:38.660 --> 57:43.660\n as a joke, is that it actually does have\n\n57:44.100 --> 57:48.340\n a much higher transaction volume capability than Bitcoin.\n\n57:49.820 --> 57:53.180\n And the costs of doing a transaction,\n\n57:53.180 --> 57:55.980\n the Doge coin fee is very low.\n\n57:55.980 --> 57:58.220\n Like right now, if you want to do a Bitcoin transaction,\n\n57:58.220 --> 58:00.460\n the price of doing that transaction is very high.\n\n58:00.460 --> 58:04.340\n So, you could not use it effectively for most things.\n\n58:04.340 --> 58:09.340\n And nor could it even scale to a high volume.\n\n58:11.860 --> 58:15.260\n And when Bitcoin started, I guess around 2008\n\n58:15.260 --> 58:18.740\n or something like that, the internet connections\n\n58:18.740 --> 58:20.820\n were much worse than they are today.\n\n58:20.820 --> 58:23.620\n Like Order of magnitude, I mean,\n\n58:23.620 --> 58:26.860\n just way, way worse in 2008.\n\n58:26.860 --> 58:31.860\n So, like having a small block size or whatever\n\n58:31.860 --> 58:36.860\n is, and a long synchronization time made sense in 2008.\n\n58:37.820 --> 58:41.380\n But 2021, or fast forward 10 years,\n\n58:41.380 --> 58:45.380\n it's like comically low.\n\n58:50.540 --> 58:55.540\n And I think there's some value to having a linear increase\n\n58:55.580 --> 58:58.620\n in the amount of currency that is generated.\n\n58:58.620 --> 59:01.060\n So, because some amount of the currency,\n\n59:01.060 --> 59:05.060\n like if a currency is too deflationary,\n\n59:05.060 --> 59:10.060\n or I should say, if a currency is expected\n\n59:10.140 --> 59:11.700\n to increase in value over time,\n\n59:11.700 --> 59:14.220\n there's reluctance to spend it.\n\n59:14.220 --> 59:17.380\n Because you're like, oh, I'll just hold it and not spend it\n\n59:17.380 --> 59:19.380\n because it's scarcity is increasing with time.\n\n59:19.380 --> 59:22.180\n So, if I spend it now, then I will regret spending it.\n\n59:22.180 --> 59:24.980\n So, I will just, you know, hodl it.\n\n59:24.980 --> 59:27.980\n But if there's some dilution of the currency occurring\n\n59:27.980 --> 59:29.860\n over time, that's more of an incentive\n\n59:29.860 --> 59:31.260\n to use it as a currency.\n\n59:31.260 --> 59:36.260\n So, those coins, somewhat randomly has just a fixed,\n\n59:39.220 --> 59:43.220\n a number of sort of coins or hash strings\n\n59:43.220 --> 59:46.540\n that are generated every year.\n\n59:46.540 --> 59:49.860\n So, there's some inflation, but it's not a percentage base.\n\n59:49.860 --> 59:54.340\n It's a percentage of the total amount of money\n\n59:54.340 --> 59:55.700\n it's a fixed number.\n\n59:55.700 --> 59:58.380\n So, the percentage of inflation\n\n59:58.380 --> 1:00:00.140\n will necessarily decline over time.\n\n1:00:02.700 --> 1:00:06.340\n So, I'm not saying that it's like the ideal system\n\n1:00:06.340 --> 1:00:09.500\n for a currency, but I think it actually is\n\n1:00:09.500 --> 1:00:13.460\n just fundamentally better than anything else I've seen\n\n1:00:13.460 --> 1:00:16.420\n just by accident, so.\n\n1:00:16.420 --> 1:00:19.740\n I like how you said around 2008.\n\n1:00:19.740 --> 1:00:23.420\n So, you're not, you know, some people suggested\n\n1:00:23.420 --> 1:00:24.820\n you might be Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n1:00:24.820 --> 1:00:26.340\n You've previously said you're not.\n\n1:00:26.340 --> 1:00:27.180\n Let me ask.\n\n1:00:27.180 --> 1:00:28.780\n You're not for sure.\n\n1:00:28.780 --> 1:00:30.140\n Would you tell us if you were?\n\n1:00:30.140 --> 1:00:30.980\n Yes.\n\n1:00:30.980 --> 1:00:31.820\n Okay.\n\n1:00:33.460 --> 1:00:34.780\n Do you think it's a feature or a bug\n\n1:00:34.780 --> 1:00:37.260\n that he's anonymous or she or they?\n\n1:00:38.980 --> 1:00:41.700\n It's an interesting kind of quirk of human history\n\n1:00:41.700 --> 1:00:43.580\n that there is a particular technology\n\n1:00:43.580 --> 1:00:46.140\n that is a completely anonymous inventor\n\n1:00:46.140 --> 1:00:51.140\n or creator.\n\n1:01:03.380 --> 1:01:08.020\n Well, I mean, you can look at the evolution of ideas\n\n1:01:10.060 --> 1:01:11.860\n before the launch of Bitcoin\n\n1:01:11.860 --> 1:01:16.860\n and see who wrote, you know, about those ideas.\n\n1:01:19.540 --> 1:01:21.900\n And then, like, I don't know exactly,\n\n1:01:21.900 --> 1:01:24.180\n obviously I don't know who created Bitcoin\n\n1:01:24.180 --> 1:01:25.180\n for practical purposes,\n\n1:01:25.180 --> 1:01:28.980\n but the evolution of ideas is pretty clear for that.\n\n1:01:28.980 --> 1:01:31.940\n And like, it seems as though like Nick Szabo\n\n1:01:31.940 --> 1:01:35.260\n is probably more than anyone else responsible\n\n1:01:35.260 --> 1:01:37.100\n for the evolution of those ideas.\n\n1:01:37.100 --> 1:01:41.100\n So, he claims not to be Satoshi Nakamoto,\n\n1:01:41.100 --> 1:01:44.460\n but I'm not sure that's neither here nor there,\n\n1:01:44.460 --> 1:01:47.700\n but he seems to be the one more responsible\n\n1:01:47.700 --> 1:01:50.340\n for the ideas behind Bitcoin than anyone else.\n\n1:01:50.340 --> 1:01:52.820\n So, it's not perhaps like singular figures\n\n1:01:52.820 --> 1:01:55.740\n aren't even as important as the figures involved\n\n1:01:55.740 --> 1:01:58.100\n in the evolution of ideas, the Leto thing, so.\n\n1:01:58.100 --> 1:01:58.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:01:58.940 --> 1:02:02.260\n Yeah, it's, you know, perhaps it's sad\n\n1:02:02.260 --> 1:02:03.100\n to think about history,\n\n1:02:03.100 --> 1:02:06.340\n but maybe most names will be forgotten anyway.\n\n1:02:06.340 --> 1:02:07.460\n What is a name anyway?\n\n1:02:07.460 --> 1:02:11.260\n It's a name attached to an idea.\n\n1:02:11.260 --> 1:02:13.700\n What does it even mean, really?\n\n1:02:13.700 --> 1:02:16.260\n I think Shakespeare had a thing about roses and stuff,\n\n1:02:16.260 --> 1:02:17.220\n whatever he said.\n\n1:02:17.220 --> 1:02:19.500\n A rose by any other name, it smells sweet.\n\n1:02:22.420 --> 1:02:24.340\n I got Elon to quote Shakespeare.\n\n1:02:24.340 --> 1:02:26.900\n I feel like I accomplished something today.\n\n1:02:26.900 --> 1:02:28.860\n Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\n\n1:02:28.860 --> 1:02:30.820\n What?\n\n1:02:30.820 --> 1:02:31.820\n I'm gonna clip that out.\n\n1:02:31.820 --> 1:02:33.980\n I said it to people.\n\n1:02:33.980 --> 1:02:38.980\n Not more temperate and more fair.\n\n1:02:39.060 --> 1:02:40.620\n Autopilot.\n\n1:02:40.620 --> 1:02:41.460\n Tesla autopilot.\n\n1:02:46.140 --> 1:02:48.500\n Tesla autopilot has been through an incredible journey\n\n1:02:48.500 --> 1:02:50.540\n over the past six years,\n\n1:02:50.540 --> 1:02:52.780\n or perhaps even longer in the minds of,\n\n1:02:52.780 --> 1:02:55.180\n in your mind and the minds of many involved.\n\n1:02:57.020 --> 1:02:58.980\n Yeah, I think that's where we first like connected really\n\n1:02:58.980 --> 1:03:01.900\n was the autopilot stuff, autonomy and.\n\n1:03:01.900 --> 1:03:05.220\n The whole journey was incredible to me to watch.\n\n1:03:05.220 --> 1:03:10.220\n I was, because I knew, well, part of it is I was at MIT\n\n1:03:10.340 --> 1:03:13.180\n and I knew the difficulty of computer vision.\n\n1:03:13.180 --> 1:03:15.780\n And I knew the whole, I had a lot of colleagues and friends\n\n1:03:15.780 --> 1:03:18.420\n about the DARPA challenge and knew how difficult it is.\n\n1:03:18.420 --> 1:03:20.140\n And so there was a natural skepticism\n\n1:03:20.140 --> 1:03:23.700\n when I first drove a Tesla with the initial system\n\n1:03:23.700 --> 1:03:25.140\n based on Mobileye.\n\n1:03:25.140 --> 1:03:28.900\n I thought there's no way, so first when I got in,\n\n1:03:28.900 --> 1:03:32.580\n I thought there's no way this car could maintain,\n\n1:03:32.580 --> 1:03:35.900\n like stay in the lane and create a comfortable experience.\n\n1:03:35.900 --> 1:03:39.500\n So my intuition initially was that the lane keeping problem\n\n1:03:39.500 --> 1:03:41.780\n is way too difficult to solve.\n\n1:03:41.780 --> 1:03:43.900\n Oh, lane keeping, yeah, that's relatively easy.\n\n1:03:43.900 --> 1:03:47.820\n Well, like, but not this, but solve in the way\n\n1:03:47.820 --> 1:03:50.860\n that we just, we talked about previous is prototype\n\n1:03:50.860 --> 1:03:54.380\n versus a thing that actually creates a pleasant experience\n\n1:03:54.380 --> 1:03:57.460\n over hundreds of thousands of miles or millions.\n\n1:03:57.460 --> 1:04:00.460\n Yeah, so we had to wrap a lot of code\n\n1:04:00.460 --> 1:04:01.740\n around the Mobileye thing.\n\n1:04:01.740 --> 1:04:04.380\n It doesn't just work by itself.\n\n1:04:04.380 --> 1:04:06.420\n I mean, that's part of the story\n\n1:04:06.420 --> 1:04:07.980\n of how you approach things sometimes.\n\n1:04:07.980 --> 1:04:09.680\n Sometimes you do things from scratch.\n\n1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:12.340\n Sometimes at first you kind of see what's out there\n\n1:04:12.340 --> 1:04:14.340\n and then you decide to do from scratch.\n\n1:04:14.340 --> 1:04:17.180\n That was one of the boldest decisions I've seen\n\n1:04:17.180 --> 1:04:18.820\n is both in the hardware and the software\n\n1:04:18.820 --> 1:04:21.020\n to decide to eventually go from scratch.\n\n1:04:21.020 --> 1:04:22.700\n I thought, again, I was skeptical\n\n1:04:22.700 --> 1:04:24.500\n of whether that's going to be able to work out\n\n1:04:24.500 --> 1:04:26.860\n because it's such a difficult problem.\n\n1:04:26.860 --> 1:04:28.900\n And so it was an incredible journey\n\n1:04:28.900 --> 1:04:31.460\n what I see now with everything,\n\n1:04:31.460 --> 1:04:33.220\n the hardware, the compute, the sensors,\n\n1:04:33.220 --> 1:04:37.300\n the things I maybe care and love about most\n\n1:04:37.300 --> 1:04:40.060\n is the stuff that Andre Karpathy is leading\n\n1:04:40.060 --> 1:04:41.740\n with the data set selection,\n\n1:04:41.740 --> 1:04:43.100\n the whole data engine process,\n\n1:04:43.100 --> 1:04:45.020\n the neural network architectures,\n\n1:04:45.020 --> 1:04:47.300\n the way that's in the real world,\n\n1:04:47.300 --> 1:04:49.380\n that network is tested, validated,\n\n1:04:49.380 --> 1:04:50.900\n all the different test sets,\n\n1:04:52.340 --> 1:04:54.740\n versus the ImageNet model of computer vision,\n\n1:04:54.740 --> 1:04:58.340\n like what's in academia is like real world\n\n1:04:58.340 --> 1:04:59.720\n artificial intelligence.\n\n1:05:01.340 --> 1:05:04.220\n And Andre's awesome and obviously plays an important role,\n\n1:05:04.220 --> 1:05:07.780\n but we have a lot of really talented people driving things.\n\n1:05:09.540 --> 1:05:12.760\n And Ashok is actually the head of autopilot engineering.\n\n1:05:14.820 --> 1:05:16.380\n Andre's the director of AI.\n\n1:05:16.380 --> 1:05:17.700\n AI stuff, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:05:17.700 --> 1:05:20.580\n So yeah, I'm aware that there's an incredible team\n\n1:05:20.580 --> 1:05:22.060\n of just a lot going on.\n\n1:05:22.060 --> 1:05:26.060\n Yeah, obviously people will give me too much credit\n\n1:05:26.060 --> 1:05:28.700\n and they'll give Andre too much credit, so.\n\n1:05:28.700 --> 1:05:31.700\n And people should realize how much is going on\n\n1:05:31.700 --> 1:05:32.540\n under the hood.\n\n1:05:32.540 --> 1:05:34.940\n Yeah, it's just a lot of really talented people.\n\n1:05:36.540 --> 1:05:40.020\n The Tesla Autopilot AI team is extremely talented.\n\n1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:42.620\n It's like some of the smartest people in the world.\n\n1:05:43.700 --> 1:05:45.060\n So yeah, we're getting it done.\n\n1:05:45.060 --> 1:05:47.660\n What are some insights you've gained\n\n1:05:47.660 --> 1:05:51.300\n over those five, six years of autopilot\n\n1:05:51.300 --> 1:05:54.260\n about the problem of autonomous driving?\n\n1:05:54.260 --> 1:05:58.580\n So you leaped in having some sort of\n\n1:05:58.580 --> 1:06:00.820\n first principles kinds of intuitions,\n\n1:06:00.820 --> 1:06:05.340\n but nobody knows how difficult the problem, like the problem.\n\n1:06:05.340 --> 1:06:07.140\n I thought the self driving problem would be hard,\n\n1:06:07.140 --> 1:06:08.980\n but it was harder than I thought.\n\n1:06:08.980 --> 1:06:09.980\n It's not like I thought it would be easy.\n\n1:06:09.980 --> 1:06:10.800\n I thought it would be very hard,\n\n1:06:10.800 --> 1:06:14.220\n but it was actually way harder than even that.\n\n1:06:14.220 --> 1:06:17.060\n So, I mean, what it comes down to at the end of the day\n\n1:06:17.060 --> 1:06:18.760\n is to solve self driving,\n\n1:06:18.760 --> 1:06:23.760\n you basically need to recreate what humans do to drive,\n\n1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:31.480\n which is humans drive with optical sensors,\n\n1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:33.800\n eyes and biological neural nets.\n\n1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:36.420\n And so in order to,\n\n1:06:36.420 --> 1:06:39.120\n that's how the entire road system is designed to work\n\n1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:43.920\n with basically passive optical and neural nets,\n\n1:06:45.360 --> 1:06:46.200\n biologically.\n\n1:06:46.200 --> 1:06:47.920\n And now that we need to,\n\n1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:50.080\n so for actually for full self driving to work,\n\n1:06:50.080 --> 1:06:52.080\n we have to recreate that in digital form.\n\n1:06:52.960 --> 1:06:57.960\n So we have to, that means cameras with advanced neural nets\n\n1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:06.400\n in silicon form, and then it will obviously solve\n\n1:07:06.400 --> 1:07:08.000\n for full self driving.\n\n1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:09.000\n That's the only way.\n\n1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:10.320\n I don't think there's any other way.\n\n1:07:10.320 --> 1:07:12.920\n But the question is what aspects of human nature\n\n1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:15.560\n do you have to encode into the machine, right?\n\n1:07:15.560 --> 1:07:18.720\n Do you have to solve the perception problem, like detect?\n\n1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:21.320\n And then you first realize\n\n1:07:21.320 --> 1:07:23.080\n what is the perception problem for driving,\n\n1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:25.400\n like all the kinds of things you have to be able to see,\n\n1:07:25.400 --> 1:07:27.900\n like what do we even look at when we drive?\n\n1:07:27.900 --> 1:07:32.440\n There's, I just recently heard Andre talked about MIT\n\n1:07:32.440 --> 1:07:33.720\n about car doors.\n\n1:07:33.720 --> 1:07:36.080\n I think it was the world's greatest talk of all time\n\n1:07:36.080 --> 1:07:41.080\n about car doors, the fine details of car doors.\n\n1:07:41.380 --> 1:07:44.440\n Like what is even an open car door, man?\n\n1:07:44.440 --> 1:07:46.880\n So like the ontology of that,\n\n1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:48.000\n that's a perception problem.\n\n1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:49.880\n We humans solve that perception problem,\n\n1:07:49.880 --> 1:07:51.640\n and Tesla has to solve that problem.\n\n1:07:51.640 --> 1:07:53.380\n And then there's the control and the planning\n\n1:07:53.380 --> 1:07:54.980\n coupled with the perception.\n\n1:07:54.980 --> 1:07:58.280\n You have to figure out like what's involved in driving,\n\n1:07:58.280 --> 1:08:00.880\n like especially in all the different edge cases.\n\n1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:06.540\n And then, I mean, maybe you can comment on this,\n\n1:08:06.540 --> 1:08:10.920\n how much game theoretic kind of stuff needs to be involved\n\n1:08:10.920 --> 1:08:12.700\n at a four way stop sign.\n\n1:08:12.700 --> 1:08:17.700\n As humans, when we drive, our actions affect the world.\n\n1:08:18.060 --> 1:08:20.780\n Like it changes how others behave.\n\n1:08:20.780 --> 1:08:23.340\n Most autonomous driving, if you,\n\n1:08:23.340 --> 1:08:27.420\n you're usually just responding to the scene\n\n1:08:27.420 --> 1:08:31.360\n as opposed to like really asserting yourself in the scene.\n\n1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:32.200\n Do you think?\n\n1:08:33.140 --> 1:08:37.580\n I think these sort of control logic conundrums\n\n1:08:37.580 --> 1:08:39.340\n are not the hard part.\n\n1:08:39.340 --> 1:08:43.580\n The, you know, let's see.\n\n1:08:45.540 --> 1:08:46.860\n What do you think is the hard part\n\n1:08:46.860 --> 1:08:50.580\n in this whole beautiful, complex problem?\n\n1:08:50.580 --> 1:08:52.980\n So it's a lot of freaking software, man.\n\n1:08:52.980 --> 1:08:54.380\n A lot of smart lines of code.\n\n1:08:57.300 --> 1:08:59.660\n For sure, in order to have,\n\n1:09:01.340 --> 1:09:03.980\n create an accurate vector space.\n\n1:09:03.980 --> 1:09:08.280\n So like you're coming from image space,\n\n1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:12.540\n which is like this flow of photons,\n\n1:09:12.540 --> 1:09:14.380\n you're going to the camera, cameras,\n\n1:09:14.380 --> 1:09:19.380\n and then you have this massive bitstream\n\n1:09:21.220 --> 1:09:26.220\n in image space, and then you have to effectively compress\n\n1:09:29.580 --> 1:09:34.580\n a massive bitstream corresponding to photons\n\n1:09:34.580 --> 1:09:38.500\n that knocked off an electron in a camera sensor\n\n1:09:38.500 --> 1:09:42.500\n and turn that bitstream into a vector space.\n\n1:09:44.860 --> 1:09:47.860\n By vector space, I mean like, you know,\n\n1:09:47.860 --> 1:09:52.860\n you've got cars and humans and lane lines and curves\n\n1:09:55.060 --> 1:09:59.380\n and traffic lights and that kind of thing.\n\n1:09:59.380 --> 1:10:03.180\n Once you've got all of that in your head,\n\n1:10:03.180 --> 1:10:08.180\n once you have an accurate vector space,\n\n1:10:08.500 --> 1:10:11.680\n the control problem is similar to that of a video game,\n\n1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:14.100\n like a Grand Theft Auto of Cyberpunk,\n\n1:10:14.100 --> 1:10:16.260\n if you have accurate vector space.\n\n1:10:16.260 --> 1:10:18.300\n It's the control problem is,\n\n1:10:18.300 --> 1:10:20.300\n I wouldn't say it's trivial, it's not trivial,\n\n1:10:20.300 --> 1:10:25.300\n but it's not like some insurmountable thing.\n\n1:10:29.020 --> 1:10:32.140\n Having an accurate vector space is very difficult.\n\n1:10:32.140 --> 1:10:35.540\n Yeah, I think we humans don't give enough respect\n\n1:10:35.540 --> 1:10:37.900\n to how incredible the human perception system is\n\n1:10:37.900 --> 1:10:42.460\n to mapping the raw photons to the vector space\n\n1:10:42.460 --> 1:10:44.660\n representation in our heads.\n\n1:10:44.660 --> 1:10:47.460\n Your brain is doing an incredible amount of processing\n\n1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:51.360\n and giving you an image that is a very cleaned up image.\n\n1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:53.380\n Like when we look around here, we see,\n\n1:10:53.380 --> 1:10:55.340\n like you see color in the corners of your eyes,\n\n1:10:55.340 --> 1:10:59.420\n but actually your eyes have very few cones,\n\n1:10:59.420 --> 1:11:02.260\n like cone receptors in the peripheral vision.\n\n1:11:02.260 --> 1:11:05.660\n Your eyes are painting color in the peripheral vision.\n\n1:11:05.660 --> 1:11:06.500\n You don't realize it,\n\n1:11:06.500 --> 1:11:09.060\n but their eyes are actually painting color\n\n1:11:09.060 --> 1:11:12.260\n and your eyes also have like this blood vessels\n\n1:11:12.260 --> 1:11:14.660\n and all sorts of gnarly things and there's a blind spot,\n\n1:11:14.660 --> 1:11:16.380\n but do you see your blind spot?\n\n1:11:16.380 --> 1:11:21.180\n No, your brain is painting in the missing, the blind spot.\n\n1:11:21.180 --> 1:11:24.980\n You're gonna do these things online where you look here\n\n1:11:24.980 --> 1:11:27.380\n and look at this point and then look at this point\n\n1:11:27.380 --> 1:11:30.460\n and if it's in your blind spot,\n\n1:11:30.460 --> 1:11:33.660\n your brain will just fill in the missing bits.\n\n1:11:33.660 --> 1:11:35.500\n The peripheral vision is so cool.\n\n1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:38.060\n It makes you realize all the illusions for vision sciences,\n\n1:11:38.060 --> 1:11:40.620\n so it makes you realize just how incredible the brain is.\n\n1:11:40.620 --> 1:11:42.660\n The brain is doing crazy amount of post processing\n\n1:11:42.660 --> 1:11:44.780\n on the vision signals for your eyes.\n\n1:11:45.820 --> 1:11:46.660\n It's insane.\n\n1:11:49.180 --> 1:11:51.940\n And then even once you get all those vision signals,\n\n1:11:51.940 --> 1:11:56.260\n your brain is constantly trying to forget\n\n1:11:56.260 --> 1:11:57.660\n as much as possible.\n\n1:11:57.660 --> 1:11:59.500\n So human memory is,\n\n1:11:59.500 --> 1:12:01.900\n perhaps the weakest thing about the brain is memory.\n\n1:12:01.900 --> 1:12:05.260\n So because memory is so expensive to our brain\n\n1:12:05.260 --> 1:12:06.660\n and so limited,\n\n1:12:06.660 --> 1:12:09.740\n your brain is trying to forget as much as possible\n\n1:12:09.740 --> 1:12:12.140\n and distill the things that you see\n\n1:12:12.140 --> 1:12:16.500\n into the smallest amounts of information possible.\n\n1:12:16.500 --> 1:12:19.340\n So your brain is trying to not just get to a vector space,\n\n1:12:19.340 --> 1:12:22.860\n but get to a vector space that is the smallest possible\n\n1:12:22.860 --> 1:12:25.020\n vector space of only relevant objects.\n\n1:12:26.620 --> 1:12:29.860\n And I think you can sort of look inside your brain\n\n1:12:29.860 --> 1:12:31.540\n or at least I can,\n\n1:12:31.540 --> 1:12:35.380\n when you drive down the road and try to think about\n\n1:12:35.380 --> 1:12:38.940\n what your brain is actually doing consciously.\n\n1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:43.940\n And it's like you'll see a car,\n\n1:12:44.540 --> 1:12:46.860\n because you don't have cameras,\n\n1:12:46.860 --> 1:12:48.940\n I don't have eyes in the back of your head or a side.\n\n1:12:48.940 --> 1:12:53.940\n So you basically have like two cameras on a slow gimbal.\n\n1:13:00.460 --> 1:13:01.700\n And eyesight is not that great.\n\n1:13:01.700 --> 1:13:04.300\n Okay, human eyes are like,\n\n1:13:04.300 --> 1:13:05.700\n and people are constantly distracted\n\n1:13:05.700 --> 1:13:07.180\n and thinking about things and texting\n\n1:13:07.180 --> 1:13:09.260\n and doing all sorts of things they shouldn't do in a car,\n\n1:13:09.260 --> 1:13:10.940\n changing the radio station.\n\n1:13:10.940 --> 1:13:15.060\n So having arguments is like,\n\n1:13:15.060 --> 1:13:20.060\n so when's the last time you looked right and left\n\n1:13:22.540 --> 1:13:27.060\n and rearward, or even diagonally forward\n\n1:13:27.060 --> 1:13:30.140\n to actually refresh your vector space?\n\n1:13:30.140 --> 1:13:32.740\n So you're glancing around and what your mind is doing\n\n1:13:32.740 --> 1:13:37.300\n is trying to distill the relevant vectors,\n\n1:13:37.300 --> 1:13:40.220\n basically objects with a position and motion.\n\n1:13:40.220 --> 1:13:45.220\n And then editing that down to the least amount\n\n1:13:48.140 --> 1:13:49.940\n that's necessary for you to drive.\n\n1:13:49.940 --> 1:13:53.260\n It does seem to be able to edit it down\n\n1:13:53.260 --> 1:13:55.780\n or compress it even further into things like concepts.\n\n1:13:55.780 --> 1:13:57.660\n So it's not, it's like it goes beyond,\n\n1:13:57.660 --> 1:14:01.260\n the human mind seems to go sometimes beyond vector space\n\n1:14:01.260 --> 1:14:05.080\n to sort of space of concepts to where you'll see a thing.\n\n1:14:05.080 --> 1:14:07.520\n It's no longer represented spatially somehow.\n\n1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:10.060\n It's almost like a concept that you should be aware of.\n\n1:14:10.060 --> 1:14:12.300\n Like if this is a school zone,\n\n1:14:12.300 --> 1:14:14.940\n you'll remember that as a concept,\n\n1:14:14.940 --> 1:14:16.420\n which is a weird thing to represent,\n\n1:14:16.420 --> 1:14:17.480\n but perhaps for driving,\n\n1:14:17.480 --> 1:14:20.460\n you don't need to fully represent those things.\n\n1:14:20.460 --> 1:14:25.460\n Or maybe you get those kind of indirectly.\n\n1:14:25.860 --> 1:14:27.740\n You need to establish vector space\n\n1:14:27.740 --> 1:14:32.740\n and then actually have predictions for those vector spaces.\n\n1:14:32.740 --> 1:14:37.740\n So if you drive past, say a bus and you see that there's people,\n\n1:14:47.340 --> 1:14:48.500\n before you drove past the bus,\n\n1:14:48.500 --> 1:14:50.580\n you saw people crossing or some,\n\n1:14:50.580 --> 1:14:52.820\n just imagine there's like a large truck\n\n1:14:52.820 --> 1:14:54.220\n or something blocking site.\n\n1:14:55.500 --> 1:14:57.420\n But before you came up to the truck,\n\n1:14:57.420 --> 1:15:00.700\n you saw that there were some kids about to cross the road\n\n1:15:00.700 --> 1:15:01.540\n in front of the truck.\n\n1:15:01.540 --> 1:15:03.260\n Now you can no longer see the kids,\n\n1:15:03.260 --> 1:15:06.300\n but you would now know, okay,\n\n1:15:06.300 --> 1:15:09.020\n those kids are probably gonna pass by the truck\n\n1:15:09.020 --> 1:15:12.020\n and cross the road, even though you cannot see them.\n\n1:15:12.020 --> 1:15:15.980\n So you have to have memory,\n\n1:15:17.340 --> 1:15:19.100\n you have to need to remember that there were kids there\n\n1:15:19.100 --> 1:15:21.820\n and you need to have some forward prediction\n\n1:15:21.820 --> 1:15:25.660\n of what their position will be at the time of relevance.\n\n1:15:25.660 --> 1:15:28.540\n So with occlusions and computer vision,\n\n1:15:28.540 --> 1:15:30.840\n when you can't see an object anymore,\n\n1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:33.460\n even when it just walks behind a tree and reappears,\n\n1:15:33.460 --> 1:15:35.100\n that's a really, really,\n\n1:15:35.100 --> 1:15:37.100\n I mean, at least in academic literature,\n\n1:15:37.100 --> 1:15:40.620\n it's tracking through occlusions, it's very difficult.\n\n1:15:40.620 --> 1:15:41.940\n Yeah, we're doing it.\n\n1:15:41.940 --> 1:15:42.780\n I understand this.\n\n1:15:42.780 --> 1:15:43.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:44.440\n So some of it.\n\n1:15:44.440 --> 1:15:45.420\n It's like object permanence,\n\n1:15:45.420 --> 1:15:47.700\n like same thing happens with humans with neural nets.\n\n1:15:47.700 --> 1:15:50.100\n Like when like a toddler grows up,\n\n1:15:50.100 --> 1:15:54.420\n like there's a point in time where they develop,\n\n1:15:54.420 --> 1:15:56.220\n they have a sense of object permanence.\n\n1:15:56.220 --> 1:15:59.580\n So before a certain age, if you have a ball or a toy\n\n1:15:59.580 --> 1:16:01.180\n or whatever, and you put it behind your back\n\n1:16:01.180 --> 1:16:03.360\n and you pop it out, if they don't,\n\n1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:04.660\n before they have object permanence,\n\n1:16:04.660 --> 1:16:05.860\n it's like a new thing every time.\n\n1:16:05.860 --> 1:16:08.260\n It's like, whoa, this toy went poof, just fared\n\n1:16:08.260 --> 1:16:09.980\n and now it's back again and they can't believe it.\n\n1:16:09.980 --> 1:16:12.140\n And that they can play peekaboo all day long\n\n1:16:12.140 --> 1:16:13.940\n because peekaboo is fresh every time.\n\n1:16:13.940 --> 1:16:18.220\n But then we figured out object permanence,\n\n1:16:18.220 --> 1:16:20.360\n then they realize, oh no, the object is not gone,\n\n1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:21.760\n it's just behind your back.\n\n1:16:22.660 --> 1:16:26.380\n Sometimes I wish we never did figure out object permanence.\n\n1:16:26.380 --> 1:16:28.260\n Yeah, so that's a...\n\n1:16:28.260 --> 1:16:31.620\n So that's an important problem to solve.\n\n1:16:31.620 --> 1:16:33.960\n Yes, so like an important evolution\n\n1:16:33.960 --> 1:16:35.740\n of the neural nets in the car is\n\n1:16:39.740 --> 1:16:43.860\n memory across both time and space.\n\n1:16:43.860 --> 1:16:47.100\n So now you can't remember, like you have to say,\n\n1:16:47.100 --> 1:16:48.960\n like how long do you want to remember things for?\n\n1:16:48.960 --> 1:16:53.260\n And there's a cost to remembering things for a long time.\n\n1:16:53.260 --> 1:16:55.740\n So you can like run out of memory\n\n1:16:55.740 --> 1:16:58.600\n to try to remember too much for too long.\n\n1:16:58.600 --> 1:17:01.420\n And then you also have things that are stale\n\n1:17:01.420 --> 1:17:03.540\n if you remember them for too long.\n\n1:17:03.540 --> 1:17:06.880\n And then you also need things that are remembered over time.\n\n1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:10.640\n So even if you like say have like,\n\n1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:14.580\n for our good sake, five seconds of memory on a time basis,\n\n1:17:14.580 --> 1:17:17.100\n but like let's say you're parked at a light\n\n1:17:17.100 --> 1:17:20.660\n and you saw, use a pedestrian example,\n\n1:17:20.660 --> 1:17:25.220\n that people were waiting to cross the road\n\n1:17:25.220 --> 1:17:27.820\n and you can't quite see them because of an occlusion,\n\n1:17:28.900 --> 1:17:31.820\n but they might wait for a minute before the light changes\n\n1:17:31.820 --> 1:17:33.180\n for them to cross the road.\n\n1:17:33.180 --> 1:17:36.940\n You still need to remember that that's where they were\n\n1:17:36.940 --> 1:17:38.420\n and that they're probably going\n\n1:17:38.420 --> 1:17:40.580\n to cross the road type of thing.\n\n1:17:40.580 --> 1:17:44.740\n So even if that exceeds your time based memory,\n\n1:17:44.740 --> 1:17:47.000\n it should not exceed your space memory.\n\n1:17:48.140 --> 1:17:50.500\n And I just think the data engine side of that,\n\n1:17:50.500 --> 1:17:53.540\n so getting the data to learn all of the concepts\n\n1:17:53.540 --> 1:17:56.180\n that you're saying now is an incredible process.\n\n1:17:56.180 --> 1:17:58.380\n It's this iterative process of just,\n\n1:17:58.380 --> 1:18:00.740\n it's this hydranet of many.\n\n1:18:00.740 --> 1:18:01.580\n Hydranet.\n\n1:18:03.380 --> 1:18:05.420\n We're changing the name to something else.\n\n1:18:05.420 --> 1:18:09.700\n Okay, I'm sure it'll be equally as Rick and Morty like.\n\n1:18:09.700 --> 1:18:11.460\n There's a lot of, yeah.\n\n1:18:11.460 --> 1:18:13.780\n We've rearchitected the neural net,\n\n1:18:14.700 --> 1:18:17.980\n the neural nets in the cars so many times it's crazy.\n\n1:18:17.980 --> 1:18:20.020\n Oh, so every time there's a new major version,\n\n1:18:20.020 --> 1:18:21.940\n you'll rename it to something more ridiculous\n\n1:18:21.940 --> 1:18:25.060\n or memorable and beautiful, sorry.\n\n1:18:25.060 --> 1:18:26.360\n Not ridiculous, of course.\n\n1:18:28.140 --> 1:18:32.500\n If you see the full array of neural nets\n\n1:18:32.500 --> 1:18:34.180\n that are operating in the cars,\n\n1:18:34.180 --> 1:18:35.540\n it kind of boggles the mind.\n\n1:18:36.420 --> 1:18:38.500\n There's so many layers, it's crazy.\n\n1:18:39.860 --> 1:18:41.920\n So, yeah.\n\n1:18:43.620 --> 1:18:48.620\n And we started off with simple neural nets\n\n1:18:48.620 --> 1:18:53.300\n that were basically image recognition\n\n1:18:53.300 --> 1:18:56.620\n on a single frame from a single camera\n\n1:18:56.620 --> 1:19:00.700\n and then trying to knit those together\n\n1:19:00.700 --> 1:19:05.700\n with C, I should say we're really primarily running C here\n\n1:19:07.680 --> 1:19:10.000\n because C++ is too much overhead\n\n1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:11.660\n and we have our own C compiler.\n\n1:19:11.660 --> 1:19:13.580\n So to get maximum performance,\n\n1:19:13.580 --> 1:19:15.780\n we actually wrote our own C compiler\n\n1:19:15.780 --> 1:19:18.060\n and are continuing to optimize our C compiler\n\n1:19:18.060 --> 1:19:20.060\n for maximum efficiency.\n\n1:19:20.060 --> 1:19:23.100\n In fact, we've just recently done a new river\n\n1:19:23.100 --> 1:19:25.260\n on our C compiler that'll compile directly\n\n1:19:25.260 --> 1:19:26.980\n to our autopilot hardware.\n\n1:19:26.980 --> 1:19:28.960\n If you want to compile the whole thing down\n\n1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:32.660\n with your own compiler, like so efficiency here,\n\n1:19:32.660 --> 1:19:33.940\n because there's all kinds of compute,\n\n1:19:33.940 --> 1:19:37.340\n there's CPU, GPU, there's like basic types of things\n\n1:19:37.340 --> 1:19:39.140\n and you have to somehow figure out the scheduling\n\n1:19:39.140 --> 1:19:40.140\n across all of those things.\n\n1:19:40.140 --> 1:19:43.320\n And so you're compiling the code down that does all, okay.\n\n1:19:44.500 --> 1:19:46.900\n So that's why there's a lot of people involved.\n\n1:19:46.900 --> 1:19:50.620\n There's a lot of hardcore software engineering\n\n1:19:50.620 --> 1:19:54.700\n at a very sort of bare metal level\n\n1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:57.280\n because we're trying to do a lot of compute\n\n1:19:57.280 --> 1:20:02.280\n that's constrained to our full self driving computer.\n\n1:20:03.040 --> 1:20:06.780\n So we want to try to have the highest frames per second\n\n1:20:07.740 --> 1:20:12.740\n possible in a sort of very finite amount of compute\n\n1:20:14.580 --> 1:20:15.420\n and power.\n\n1:20:15.420 --> 1:20:20.420\n So we really put a lot of effort into the efficiency\n\n1:20:20.940 --> 1:20:21.780\n of our compute.\n\n1:20:23.820 --> 1:20:26.060\n And so there's actually a lot of work done\n\n1:20:26.060 --> 1:20:29.660\n by some very talented software engineers at Tesla\n\n1:20:29.660 --> 1:20:33.140\n that at a very foundational level\n\n1:20:33.140 --> 1:20:35.260\n to improve the efficiency of compute\n\n1:20:35.260 --> 1:20:38.940\n and how we use the trip accelerators,\n\n1:20:38.940 --> 1:20:43.180\n which are basically, you know,\n\n1:20:43.180 --> 1:20:45.420\n doing matrix math dot products,\n\n1:20:45.420 --> 1:20:47.340\n like a bazillion dot products.\n\n1:20:47.340 --> 1:20:49.580\n And it's like, what are neural nets?\n\n1:20:49.580 --> 1:20:53.200\n It's like compute wise, like 99% dot products.\n\n1:20:54.340 --> 1:20:57.100\n So, you know.\n\n1:20:57.100 --> 1:20:59.700\n And you want to achieve as many high frame rates\n\n1:20:59.700 --> 1:21:00.580\n like a video game.\n\n1:21:00.580 --> 1:21:05.020\n You want full resolution, high frame rate.\n\n1:21:05.020 --> 1:21:10.020\n High frame rate, low latency, low jitter.\n\n1:21:10.020 --> 1:21:15.020\n So I think one of the things we're moving towards now\n\n1:21:18.340 --> 1:21:22.540\n is no post processing of the image\n\n1:21:22.540 --> 1:21:26.700\n through the image signal processor.\n\n1:21:26.700 --> 1:21:31.700\n So like what happens for cameras is that,\n\n1:21:32.580 --> 1:21:34.040\n almost all cameras is they,\n\n1:21:35.740 --> 1:21:37.700\n there's a lot of post processing done\n\n1:21:37.700 --> 1:21:40.260\n in order to make pictures look pretty.\n\n1:21:40.260 --> 1:21:43.540\n And so we don't care about pictures looking pretty.\n\n1:21:43.540 --> 1:21:45.380\n We just want the data.\n\n1:21:45.380 --> 1:21:48.780\n So we're moving just raw photon counts.\n\n1:21:48.780 --> 1:21:53.780\n So the system will, like the image that the computer sees\n\n1:21:55.060 --> 1:21:57.860\n is actually much more than what you'd see\n\n1:21:57.860 --> 1:21:59.100\n if you represented it on a camera.\n\n1:21:59.100 --> 1:22:00.780\n It's got much more data.\n\n1:22:00.780 --> 1:22:02.560\n And even in a very low light conditions,\n\n1:22:02.560 --> 1:22:05.220\n you can see that there's a small photon count difference\n\n1:22:05.220 --> 1:22:08.780\n between this spot here and that spot there,\n\n1:22:08.780 --> 1:22:09.620\n which means that,\n\n1:22:09.620 --> 1:22:12.020\n so it can see in the dark incredibly well\n\n1:22:12.900 --> 1:22:15.100\n because it can detect these tiny differences\n\n1:22:15.100 --> 1:22:16.140\n in photon counts.\n\n1:22:16.980 --> 1:22:19.820\n Like much better than you could possibly imagine.\n\n1:22:20.780 --> 1:22:25.780\n So, and then we also save 13 milliseconds on a latency.\n\n1:22:27.420 --> 1:22:28.260\n So.\n\n1:22:29.260 --> 1:22:31.220\n From removing the post processing on the image?\n\n1:22:31.220 --> 1:22:32.060\n Yes.\n\n1:22:32.060 --> 1:22:32.900\n It's like,\n\n1:22:32.900 --> 1:22:34.300\n it's incredible.\n\n1:22:34.300 --> 1:22:35.820\n Cause we've got eight cameras\n\n1:22:35.820 --> 1:22:39.780\n and then there's roughly, I don't know,\n\n1:22:39.780 --> 1:22:41.980\n one and a half milliseconds or so,\n\n1:22:41.980 --> 1:22:46.220\n maybe 1.6 milliseconds of latency for each camera.\n\n1:22:46.220 --> 1:22:51.220\n And so like going to just,\n\n1:22:53.380 --> 1:22:56.300\n basically bypassing the image processor\n\n1:22:56.300 --> 1:22:58.240\n gets us back 13 milliseconds of latency,\n\n1:22:58.240 --> 1:22:59.320\n which is important.\n\n1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:03.440\n And we track latency all the way from, you know,\n\n1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:06.760\n photon hits the camera to, you know,\n\n1:23:06.760 --> 1:23:08.920\n all the steps that it's got to go through to get,\n\n1:23:08.920 --> 1:23:12.280\n you know, go through the various neural nets\n\n1:23:12.280 --> 1:23:13.320\n and the C code.\n\n1:23:13.320 --> 1:23:16.540\n And there's a little bit of C++ there as well.\n\n1:23:17.800 --> 1:23:20.200\n Well, I can maybe a lot, but it,\n\n1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:23.080\n the core stuff is heavy duty computers all in C.\n\n1:23:25.120 --> 1:23:28.840\n And so we track that latency all the way\n\n1:23:28.840 --> 1:23:33.480\n to an output command to the drive unit to accelerate\n\n1:23:33.480 --> 1:23:36.600\n the brakes just to slow down the steering,\n\n1:23:36.600 --> 1:23:38.920\n you know, turn left or right.\n\n1:23:38.920 --> 1:23:40.680\n So, cause you go to output a command\n\n1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:41.800\n that's got to go to a controller.\n\n1:23:41.800 --> 1:23:44.120\n And like some of these controllers have an update frequency\n\n1:23:44.120 --> 1:23:46.480\n that's maybe 10 Hertz or something like that,\n\n1:23:46.480 --> 1:23:47.320\n which is slow.\n\n1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:50.240\n That's like now you lose a hundred milliseconds potentially.\n\n1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:53.960\n So, so then we want to update the,\n\n1:23:55.040 --> 1:23:58.720\n the drivers on the like say steering and braking control\n\n1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:02.920\n to have more like a hundred Hertz instead of 10 Hertz.\n\n1:24:02.920 --> 1:24:04.400\n And then you've got a 10 millisecond latency\n\n1:24:04.400 --> 1:24:06.400\n instead of a hundred millisecond worst case latency.\n\n1:24:06.400 --> 1:24:09.560\n And actually jitter is more of a challenge than latency.\n\n1:24:09.560 --> 1:24:11.000\n Cause latency is like, you can, you can,\n\n1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:13.120\n you can anticipate and predict, but if you're,\n\n1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:14.920\n but if you've got a stack up of things going\n\n1:24:14.920 --> 1:24:17.880\n from the camera to the, to the computer through\n\n1:24:17.880 --> 1:24:19.400\n then a series of other computers,\n\n1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:22.120\n and finally to an actuator on the car,\n\n1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:26.960\n if you have a stack up of tolerances of timing tolerances,\n\n1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:29.000\n then you can have quite a variable latency,\n\n1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:30.360\n which is called jitter.\n\n1:24:30.360 --> 1:24:34.840\n And, and that makes it hard to, to, to anticipate exactly\n\n1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:37.480\n what, how you should turn the car or accelerate,\n\n1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:40.640\n because if you've got maybe a hundred,\n\n1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:42.440\n 50, 200 milliseconds of jitter,\n\n1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:45.560\n then you could be off by, you know, up to 0.2 seconds.\n\n1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:47.560\n And this can make, this could make a big difference.\n\n1:24:47.560 --> 1:24:50.160\n So you have to interpolate somehow to, to, to,\n\n1:24:50.160 --> 1:24:52.400\n to deal with the effects of jitter.\n\n1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:56.940\n So that you can make like robust control decisions.\n\n1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:01.620\n You have to, so the jitters and the sensor information,\n\n1:25:01.620 --> 1:25:05.000\n or the jitter can occur at any stage in the pipeline.\n\n1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.760\n You can, if you have just, if you have fixed latency,\n\n1:25:07.760 --> 1:25:11.960\n you can anticipate and, and like say, okay,\n\n1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:16.560\n we know that our information is for argument's sake,\n\n1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:19.000\n 150 milliseconds stale.\n\n1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:22.840\n Like, so for, for, for 150 milliseconds\n\n1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:27.840\n from photon second camera to where you can measure a change\n\n1:25:28.500 --> 1:25:30.840\n in the acceleration of the vehicle.\n\n1:25:33.720 --> 1:25:38.080\n So then, then you can say, okay, well, we're going to enter,\n\n1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:39.400\n we know it's 150 milliseconds.\n\n1:25:39.400 --> 1:25:40.960\n So we're going to take that into account\n\n1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:44.240\n and, and compensate for that latency.\n\n1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:47.320\n However, if you've got then 150 milliseconds of latency\n\n1:25:47.320 --> 1:25:49.200\n plus a hundred milliseconds of jitter,\n\n1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:50.760\n that's which could be anywhere from zero,\n\n1:25:50.760 --> 1:25:52.240\n zero to a hundred milliseconds on top.\n\n1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:55.720\n So, so then your latency could be from 150 to 250 milliseconds.\n\n1:25:55.720 --> 1:25:56.680\n Now you've got a hundred milliseconds\n\n1:25:56.680 --> 1:25:58.040\n that you don't know what to do with.\n\n1:25:58.040 --> 1:25:59.960\n And that's basically random.\n\n1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:04.260\n So getting rid of jitter is extremely important.\n\n1:26:04.260 --> 1:26:05.840\n And that affects your control decisions\n\n1:26:05.840 --> 1:26:07.400\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:26:07.400 --> 1:26:08.240\n Okay.\n\n1:26:09.160 --> 1:26:11.140\n Yeah, the car's just going to fundamentally maneuver better\n\n1:26:11.140 --> 1:26:12.040\n with lower jitter.\n\n1:26:12.920 --> 1:26:13.760\n Got it.\n\n1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:16.760\n The cars will maneuver with superhuman ability\n\n1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:19.000\n and reaction time much faster than a human.\n\n1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:24.320\n I mean, I think over time the autopilot,\n\n1:26:24.320 --> 1:26:26.400\n full self driving will be capable of maneuvers\n\n1:26:26.400 --> 1:26:31.400\n that are far more than what like James Bond could do\n\n1:26:34.840 --> 1:26:36.360\n in like the best movie type of thing.\n\n1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:38.620\n That's exactly what I was imagining in my mind,\n\n1:26:38.620 --> 1:26:40.240\n as you said it.\n\n1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:41.820\n It's like an impossible maneuvers\n\n1:26:41.820 --> 1:26:43.020\n that a human couldn't do.\n\n1:26:43.020 --> 1:26:45.080\n Yeah, so.\n\n1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:48.720\n Well, let me ask sort of looking back the six years,\n\n1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:50.280\n looking out into the future,\n\n1:26:50.280 --> 1:26:51.840\n based on your current understanding,\n\n1:26:51.840 --> 1:26:53.640\n how hard do you think this,\n\n1:26:53.640 --> 1:26:55.360\n this full self driving problem,\n\n1:26:55.360 --> 1:26:58.820\n when do you think Tesla will solve level four FSD?\n\n1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:02.340\n I mean, it's looking quite likely\n\n1:27:02.340 --> 1:27:03.640\n that it will be next year.\n\n1:27:05.520 --> 1:27:07.040\n And what does the solution look like?\n\n1:27:07.040 --> 1:27:10.200\n Is it the current pool of FSD beta candidates,\n\n1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:13.120\n they start getting greater and greater\n\n1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:15.760\n as they have been degrees of autonomy,\n\n1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:17.760\n and then there's a certain level\n\n1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:20.800\n beyond which they can do their own,\n\n1:27:20.800 --> 1:27:21.840\n they can read a book.\n\n1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:23.840\n Yeah, so.\n\n1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:26.880\n I mean, you can see that anybody\n\n1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:30.640\n who's been following the full self driving beta closely\n\n1:27:30.640 --> 1:27:35.260\n will see that the rate of disengagements\n\n1:27:35.260 --> 1:27:37.440\n has been dropping rapidly.\n\n1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:40.720\n So like disengagement be where the driver intervenes\n\n1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:44.000\n to prevent the car from doing something dangerous,\n\n1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:44.940\n potentially, so.\n\n1:27:49.740 --> 1:27:53.240\n So the interventions per million miles\n\n1:27:53.240 --> 1:27:55.920\n has been dropping dramatically at some point.\n\n1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:01.040\n And that trend looks like it happens next year\n\n1:28:01.040 --> 1:28:06.040\n is that the probability of an accident on FSD\n\n1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:09.520\n is less than that of the average human,\n\n1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:12.480\n and then significantly less than that of the average human.\n\n1:28:13.480 --> 1:28:18.480\n So it certainly appears like we will get there next year.\n\n1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:24.000\n Then of course, then there's gonna be a case of,\n\n1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.040\n okay, well, we now have to prove this to regulators\n\n1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:28.640\n and prove it to, you know, and we want a standard\n\n1:28:28.640 --> 1:28:31.160\n that is not just equivalent to a human,\n\n1:28:31.160 --> 1:28:33.480\n but much better than the average human.\n\n1:28:33.480 --> 1:28:35.560\n I think it's gotta be at least two or three times\n\n1:28:35.560 --> 1:28:39.000\n two or three times higher safety than a human.\n\n1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:41.360\n So two or three times lower probability of injury\n\n1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:44.840\n than a human before we would actually say like,\n\n1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:46.800\n okay, it's okay to go, it's not gonna be equivalent,\n\n1:28:46.800 --> 1:28:48.340\n it's gonna be much better.\n\n1:28:48.340 --> 1:28:53.340\n So if you look, FSD 10.6 just came out recently,\n\n1:28:53.400 --> 1:28:57.120\n 10.7 is on the way, maybe 11 is on the way,\n\n1:28:57.120 --> 1:28:58.440\n so we're in the future.\n\n1:28:58.440 --> 1:29:01.040\n Yeah, we were hoping to get 11 out this year,\n\n1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:06.040\n but 11 actually has a whole bunch of fundamental rewrites\n\n1:29:07.180 --> 1:29:09.460\n on the neural net architecture,\n\n1:29:10.840 --> 1:29:14.040\n and some fundamental improvements\n\n1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:18.280\n in creating vector space, so.\n\n1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:22.240\n There is some fundamental like leap\n\n1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:24.000\n that really deserves the 11,\n\n1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:25.160\n I mean, that's a pretty cool number.\n\n1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:29.920\n Yeah, 11 would be a single stack\n\n1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:32.160\n for all, you know, one stack to rule them all.\n\n1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:38.600\n But there are just some really fundamental\n\n1:29:40.520 --> 1:29:42.120\n neural net architecture changes\n\n1:29:43.760 --> 1:29:47.720\n that will allow for much more capability,\n\n1:29:47.720 --> 1:29:51.080\n but at first they're gonna have issues.\n\n1:29:51.080 --> 1:29:54.680\n So like we have this working on like sort of alpha software\n\n1:29:54.680 --> 1:29:59.680\n and it's good, but it's basically taking a whole bunch\n\n1:30:00.880 --> 1:30:05.360\n of C, C++ code and leading a massive amount of C++ code\n\n1:30:05.360 --> 1:30:06.440\n and replacing it with a neural net.\n\n1:30:06.440 --> 1:30:09.160\n And Andre makes this point a lot,\n\n1:30:09.160 --> 1:30:12.480\n which is like neural nets are kind of eating software.\n\n1:30:12.480 --> 1:30:15.880\n Over time there's like less and less conventional software,\n\n1:30:15.880 --> 1:30:18.240\n more and more neural net, which is still software,\n\n1:30:18.240 --> 1:30:21.120\n but it's, you know, still comes out the lines of software,\n\n1:30:21.120 --> 1:30:25.320\n but it's more neural net stuff\n\n1:30:25.320 --> 1:30:29.800\n and less, you know, heuristics basically.\n\n1:30:33.080 --> 1:30:38.080\n More matrix based stuff and less heuristics based stuff.\n\n1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:47.080\n And, you know, like one of the big changes will be,\n\n1:30:47.080 --> 1:30:54.080\n like right now the neural nets will deliver\n\n1:30:54.080 --> 1:31:00.080\n a giant bag of points to the C++ or C and C++ code.\n\n1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:03.080\n We call it the giant bag of points.\n\n1:31:03.080 --> 1:31:08.080\n And it's like, so you've got a pixel and something associated\n\n1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:09.080\n with that pixel.\n\n1:31:09.080 --> 1:31:11.080\n Like this pixel is probably car.\n\n1:31:11.080 --> 1:31:13.080\n The pixel is probably lane line.\n\n1:31:13.080 --> 1:31:16.080\n Then you've got to assemble this giant bag of points\n\n1:31:16.080 --> 1:31:21.080\n in the C code and turn it into vectors.\n\n1:31:21.080 --> 1:31:26.080\n And it does a pretty good job of it, but it's,\n\n1:31:26.080 --> 1:31:30.080\n we want to just, you know,\n\n1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:35.080\n we need another layer of neural nets on top of that\n\n1:31:35.080 --> 1:31:40.080\n to take the giant bag of points and distill that down\n\n1:31:40.080 --> 1:31:45.080\n to a vector space in the neural net part of the software,\n\n1:31:45.080 --> 1:31:48.080\n as opposed to the heuristics part of the software.\n\n1:31:48.080 --> 1:31:51.080\n This is a big improvement.\n\n1:31:51.080 --> 1:31:52.080\n Neural nets all the way down.\n\n1:31:52.080 --> 1:31:53.080\n That's what you want.\n\n1:31:53.080 --> 1:31:58.080\n It's not even all neural nets, but this will be just a,\n\n1:31:58.080 --> 1:32:01.080\n this is a game changer to not have the bag of points,\n\n1:32:01.080 --> 1:32:04.080\n the giant bag of points that has to be assembled\n\n1:32:04.080 --> 1:32:09.080\n with many lines of C++ and have the,\n\n1:32:09.080 --> 1:32:12.080\n and have a neural net just assemble those into a vector.\n\n1:32:12.080 --> 1:32:19.080\n So the neural net is outputting much, much less data.\n\n1:32:19.080 --> 1:32:22.080\n It's outputting, this is a lane line.\n\n1:32:22.080 --> 1:32:23.080\n This is a curb.\n\n1:32:23.080 --> 1:32:24.080\n This is drivable space.\n\n1:32:24.080 --> 1:32:25.080\n This is a car.\n\n1:32:25.080 --> 1:32:29.080\n This is a pedestrian or a cyclist or something like that.\n\n1:32:29.080 --> 1:32:35.080\n It's outputting, it's really outputting proper vectors\n\n1:32:35.080 --> 1:32:39.080\n to the C, C++ control code,\n\n1:32:39.080 --> 1:32:50.080\n as opposed to the sort of constructing the vectors in C,\n\n1:32:50.080 --> 1:32:52.080\n which we've done, I think, quite a good job of,\n\n1:32:52.080 --> 1:32:55.080\n but we're kind of hitting a local maximum\n\n1:32:55.080 --> 1:32:59.080\n on how well the C can do this.\n\n1:32:59.080 --> 1:33:02.080\n So this is really a big deal.\n\n1:33:02.080 --> 1:33:04.080\n And just all of the networks in the car\n\n1:33:04.080 --> 1:33:06.080\n need to move to surround video.\n\n1:33:06.080 --> 1:33:11.080\n There's still some legacy networks that are not surround video.\n\n1:33:11.080 --> 1:33:14.080\n And all of the training needs to move to surround video\n\n1:33:14.080 --> 1:33:16.080\n and the efficiency of the training,\n\n1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:18.080\n it needs to get better and it is.\n\n1:33:18.080 --> 1:33:25.080\n And then we need to move everything to raw photon counts\n\n1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:29.080\n as opposed to processed images,\n\n1:33:29.080 --> 1:33:31.080\n which is quite a big reset on the training\n\n1:33:31.080 --> 1:33:35.080\n because the system's trained on post processed images.\n\n1:33:35.080 --> 1:33:38.080\n So we need to redo all the training\n\n1:33:38.080 --> 1:33:41.080\n to train against the raw photon counts\n\n1:33:41.080 --> 1:33:43.080\n instead of the post processed image.\n\n1:33:43.080 --> 1:33:46.080\n So ultimately, it's kind of reducing the complexity\n\n1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:47.080\n of the whole thing.\n\n1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:50.080\n So reducing the...\n\n1:33:50.080 --> 1:33:52.080\n Lines of code will actually go lower.\n\n1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:54.080\n Yeah, that's fascinating.\n\n1:33:54.080 --> 1:33:56.080\n So you're doing fusion of all the sensors\n\n1:33:56.080 --> 1:33:58.080\n and reducing the complexity of having to deal with these...\n\n1:33:58.080 --> 1:33:59.080\n Fusion of the cameras.\n\n1:33:59.080 --> 1:34:00.080\n Fusion of the cameras, really.\n\n1:34:00.080 --> 1:34:03.080\n Right, yes.\n\n1:34:03.080 --> 1:34:05.080\n Same with humans.\n\n1:34:05.080 --> 1:34:07.080\n Well, I guess we've got ears too.\n\n1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:11.080\n Yeah, we'll actually need to incorporate sound as well\n\n1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:14.080\n because you need to listen for ambulance sirens\n\n1:34:14.080 --> 1:34:20.080\n or fire trucks or somebody yelling at you or something.\n\n1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:21.080\n I don't know.\n\n1:34:21.080 --> 1:34:24.080\n There's a little bit of audio that needs to be incorporated as well.\n\n1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:26.080\n Do you need to go back for a break?\n\n1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:27.080\n Yeah, sure, let's take a break.\n\n1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:28.080\n Okay.\n\n1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:33.080\n Honestly, frankly, the ideas are the easy thing\n\n1:34:33.080 --> 1:34:35.080\n and the implementation is the hard thing.\n\n1:34:35.080 --> 1:34:37.080\n The idea of going to the moon is the easy part.\n\n1:34:37.080 --> 1:34:39.080\n Not going to the moon is the hard part.\n\n1:34:39.080 --> 1:34:40.080\n It's the hard part.\n\n1:34:40.080 --> 1:34:42.080\n And there's a lot of hardcore engineering\n\n1:34:42.080 --> 1:34:46.080\n that's got to get done at the hardware and software level.\n\n1:34:46.080 --> 1:34:48.080\n Like I said, optimizing the C compiler\n\n1:34:48.080 --> 1:34:55.080\n and just cutting out latency everywhere.\n\n1:34:55.080 --> 1:34:59.080\n If we don't do this, the system will not work properly.\n\n1:34:59.080 --> 1:35:02.080\n So the work of the engineers doing this,\n\n1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:05.080\n they are like the unsung heroes,\n\n1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:08.080\n but they are critical to the success of the situation.\n\n1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:09.080\n I think you made it clear.\n\n1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:11.080\n I mean, at least to me, it's super exciting.\n\n1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:15.080\n Everything that's going on outside of what Andre is doing.\n\n1:35:15.080 --> 1:35:17.080\n Just the whole infrastructure, the software.\n\n1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:19.080\n I mean, everything is going on with Data Engine,\n\n1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:21.080\n whatever it's called.\n\n1:35:21.080 --> 1:35:24.080\n The whole process is just work of art to me.\n\n1:35:24.080 --> 1:35:26.080\n The sheer scale of it boggles my mind.\n\n1:35:26.080 --> 1:35:29.080\n Like the training, the amount of work done with,\n\n1:35:29.080 --> 1:35:33.080\n like we've written all this custom software for training and labeling\n\n1:35:33.080 --> 1:35:34.080\n and to do auto labeling.\n\n1:35:34.080 --> 1:35:38.080\n Auto labeling is essential.\n\n1:35:38.080 --> 1:35:42.080\n Because especially when you've got surround video, it's very difficult.\n\n1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:48.080\n To label surround video from scratch is extremely difficult.\n\n1:35:48.080 --> 1:35:52.080\n Like take a human such a long time to even label one video clip,\n\n1:35:52.080 --> 1:35:54.080\n like several hours.\n\n1:35:54.080 --> 1:36:00.080\n Or the auto label, basically we just apply heavy duty,\n\n1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:06.080\n like a lot of compute to the video clips to preassign\n\n1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:09.080\n and guess what all the things are that are going on in the surround video.\n\n1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:10.080\n And then there's like correcting it.\n\n1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:11.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:36:11.080 --> 1:36:13.080\n And then all the human has to do is like tweet,\n\n1:36:13.080 --> 1:36:16.080\n like say, adjust what is incorrect.\n\n1:36:16.080 --> 1:36:21.080\n This is like increases productivity by in fact a hundred or more.\n\n1:36:21.080 --> 1:36:22.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:25.080\n So you've presented Tesla Bot as primarily useful in the factory.\n\n1:36:25.080 --> 1:36:28.080\n First of all, I think humanoid robots are incredible.\n\n1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:32.080\n From a fan of robotics, I think the elegance of movement\n\n1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:38.080\n that humanoid robots, that bipedal robots show are just so cool.\n\n1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:40.080\n So it's really interesting that you're working on this\n\n1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:44.080\n and also talking about applying the same kind of all the ideas,\n\n1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:46.080\n some of which we've talked about with Data Engine,\n\n1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:49.080\n all the things that we're talking about with Tesla Autopilot,\n\n1:36:49.080 --> 1:36:54.080\n just transferring that over to just yet another robotics problem.\n\n1:36:54.080 --> 1:36:57.080\n I have to ask, since I care about human robot interaction,\n\n1:36:57.080 --> 1:36:59.080\n so the human side of that.\n\n1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:01.080\n So you've talked about mostly in the factory.\n\n1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:06.080\n Do you see part of this problem that Tesla Bot has to solve\n\n1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:10.080\n is interacting with humans and potentially having a place like in the home.\n\n1:37:10.080 --> 1:37:15.080\n So interacting, not just not replacing labor, but also like, I don't know,\n\n1:37:15.080 --> 1:37:18.080\n being a friend or an assistant or something like that.\n\n1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:27.080\n Yeah, I think the possibilities are endless.\n\n1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:32.080\n It's not quite in Tesla's primary mission direction\n\n1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:34.080\n of accelerating sustainable energy,\n\n1:37:34.080 --> 1:37:38.080\n but it is an extremely useful thing that we can do for the world,\n\n1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:44.080\n which is to make a useful humanoid robot that is capable of interacting with the world\n\n1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:49.080\n and helping in many different ways.\n\n1:37:49.080 --> 1:37:59.080\n I think if you say extrapolate to many years in the future,\n\n1:37:59.080 --> 1:38:04.080\n I think work will become optional.\n\n1:38:04.080 --> 1:38:10.080\n There's a lot of jobs that if people weren't paid to do it,\n\n1:38:10.080 --> 1:38:12.080\n they wouldn't do it.\n\n1:38:12.080 --> 1:38:14.080\n It's not fun necessarily.\n\n1:38:14.080 --> 1:38:16.080\n If you're washing dishes all day,\n\n1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:19.080\n it's like, you know, even if you really like washing dishes,\n\n1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:22.080\n you really want to do it for eight hours a day every day.\n\n1:38:22.080 --> 1:38:25.080\n Probably not.\n\n1:38:25.080 --> 1:38:27.080\n And then there's like dangerous work.\n\n1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:30.080\n And basically, if it's dangerous, boring,\n\n1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:34.080\n it has like potential for repetitive stress injury, that kind of thing.\n\n1:38:34.080 --> 1:38:40.080\n Then that's really where humanoid robots would add the most value initially.\n\n1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:47.080\n So that's what we're aiming for is for the humanoid robots to do jobs\n\n1:38:47.080 --> 1:38:51.080\n that people don't voluntarily want to do.\n\n1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:53.080\n And then we'll have to pair that obviously\n\n1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:56.080\n with some kind of universal basic income in the future.\n\n1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:00.080\n So I think.\n\n1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:05.080\n So do you see a world when there's like hundreds of millions of Tesla bots\n\n1:39:05.080 --> 1:39:12.080\n doing different, performing different tasks throughout the world?\n\n1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:14.080\n Yeah, I haven't really thought about it that far into the future,\n\n1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:17.080\n but I guess there may be something like that.\n\n1:39:17.080 --> 1:39:20.080\n So.\n\n1:39:20.080 --> 1:39:22.080\n Can I ask a wild question?\n\n1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:25.080\n So the number of Tesla cars has been accelerating.\n\n1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:28.080\n There's been close to two million produced.\n\n1:39:28.080 --> 1:39:30.080\n Many of them have autopilot.\n\n1:39:30.080 --> 1:39:32.080\n I think we're over two million now.\n\n1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:36.080\n Do you think there will ever be a time when there will be more Tesla bots\n\n1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:40.080\n than Tesla cars?\n\n1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:42.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:42.080 --> 1:39:44.080\n Actually, it's funny you asked this question,\n\n1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:47.080\n because normally I do try to think pretty far into the future,\n\n1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:52.080\n but I haven't really thought that far into the future with the Tesla bot,\n\n1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:55.080\n or it's codenamed Optimus.\n\n1:39:55.080 --> 1:39:59.080\n I call it Optimus subprime.\n\n1:39:59.080 --> 1:40:04.080\n It's not like a giant transformer robot.\n\n1:40:04.080 --> 1:40:07.080\n So.\n\n1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:14.080\n But it's meant to be a general purpose, helpful bot.\n\n1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:18.080\n And basically, like the things that we're basically like, like,\n\n1:40:18.080 --> 1:40:25.080\n Tesla, I think is the has the most advanced real world AI\n\n1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:26.080\n for interacting with the real world,\n\n1:40:26.080 --> 1:40:30.080\n which are developed as a function of to make self driving work.\n\n1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:36.080\n And so along with custom hardware and like a lot of, you know,\n\n1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:39.080\n hardcore low level software to have it run efficiently\n\n1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:43.080\n and be power efficient because it's one thing to do neural nets\n\n1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:45.080\n if you've got a gigantic server room with 10,000 computers.\n\n1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:48.080\n But now let's say you just you have to now distill that down\n\n1:40:48.080 --> 1:40:53.080\n into one computer that's running at low power in a humanoid robot or a car.\n\n1:40:53.080 --> 1:40:54.080\n That's actually very difficult.\n\n1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:59.080\n A lot of hardcore software work is required for that.\n\n1:40:59.080 --> 1:41:05.080\n So since we're kind of like solving the navigate the real world\n\n1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:08.080\n with neural nets problem for cars,\n\n1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:10.080\n which are kind of robots with four wheels,\n\n1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:14.080\n then it's like kind of a natural extension of that is to put it\n\n1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:20.080\n in a robot with arms and legs and actuators.\n\n1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:31.080\n So like the two hard things are like you basically need to make the\n\n1:41:31.080 --> 1:41:34.080\n have the robot be intelligent enough to interact in a sensible way\n\n1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:36.080\n with the environment.\n\n1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:43.080\n So you need real world AI and you need to be very good at manufacturing,\n\n1:41:43.080 --> 1:41:44.080\n which is a very hard problem.\n\n1:41:44.080 --> 1:41:50.080\n Tesla is very good at manufacturing and also has the real world AI.\n\n1:41:50.080 --> 1:41:58.080\n So making the humanoid robot work is basically means developing custom motors\n\n1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:04.080\n and sensors that are different from what a car would use.\n\n1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:10.080\n But we've also we have I think we have the best expertise\n\n1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:15.080\n in developing advanced electric motors and power electronics.\n\n1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:22.080\n So it just has to be for humanoid robot application on a car.\n\n1:42:22.080 --> 1:42:25.080\n Still, you do talk about love sometimes.\n\n1:42:25.080 --> 1:42:26.080\n So let me ask.\n\n1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:29.080\n This isn't like for like sex robots or something like that.\n\n1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:30.080\n Love is the answer.\n\n1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:33.080\n Yes.\n\n1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:36.080\n There is something compelling to us, not compelling,\n\n1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:41.080\n but we connect with humanoid robots or even like robots like with the dog\n\n1:42:41.080 --> 1:42:43.080\n and shapes of dogs.\n\n1:42:43.080 --> 1:42:48.080\n It just it seems like, you know, there's a huge amount of loneliness in this world.\n\n1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:51.080\n All of us seek companionship with other humans, friendship\n\n1:42:51.080 --> 1:42:52.080\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:42:52.080 --> 1:42:56.080\n We have a lot of here in Austin, a lot of people have dogs.\n\n1:42:56.080 --> 1:43:01.080\n There seems to be a huge opportunity to also have robots that decrease\n\n1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:09.080\n the amount of loneliness in the world or help us humans connect with each other.\n\n1:43:09.080 --> 1:43:12.080\n So in a way that dogs can.\n\n1:43:12.080 --> 1:43:14.080\n Do you think about that with TeslaBot at all?\n\n1:43:14.080 --> 1:43:19.080\n Or is it really focused on the problem of performing specific tasks,\n\n1:43:19.080 --> 1:43:23.080\n not connecting with humans?\n\n1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:27.080\n I mean, to be honest, I have not actually thought about it from the companionship\n\n1:43:27.080 --> 1:43:31.080\n standpoint, but I think it actually would end up being it could be actually\n\n1:43:31.080 --> 1:43:34.080\n a very good companion.\n\n1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:44.080\n And it could develop like a personality over time that is that is like unique,\n\n1:43:44.080 --> 1:43:47.080\n like, you know, it's not like they're just all the robots are the same\n\n1:43:47.080 --> 1:43:53.080\n and that personality could evolve to be, you know,\n\n1:43:53.080 --> 1:43:59.080\n match the owner or the, you know, yes, the owner.\n\n1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:02.080\n Well, whatever you want to call it.\n\n1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:05.080\n The other half, right?\n\n1:44:05.080 --> 1:44:06.080\n In the same way that friends do.\n\n1:44:06.080 --> 1:44:09.080\n See, I think that's a huge opportunity.\n\n1:44:09.080 --> 1:44:14.080\n Yeah, no, that's interesting.\n\n1:44:14.080 --> 1:44:19.080\n Because, you know, like there's a Japanese phrase I like, Wabi Sabi,\n\n1:44:19.080 --> 1:44:23.080\n you know, the subtle imperfections are what makes something special.\n\n1:44:23.080 --> 1:44:28.080\n And the subtle imperfections of the personality of the robot mapped\n\n1:44:28.080 --> 1:44:34.080\n to the subtle imperfections of the robot's human friend.\n\n1:44:34.080 --> 1:44:36.080\n I don't know, owner sounds like maybe the wrong word,\n\n1:44:36.080 --> 1:44:42.080\n but could actually make an incredible buddy, basically.\n\n1:44:42.080 --> 1:44:43.080\n In that way, the imperfections.\n\n1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:46.080\n Like R2D2 or like a C3PO sort of thing, you know.\n\n1:44:46.080 --> 1:44:49.080\n So from a machine learning perspective,\n\n1:44:49.080 --> 1:44:53.080\n I think the flaws being a feature is really nice.\n\n1:44:53.080 --> 1:44:57.080\n You could be quite terrible at being a robot for quite a while\n\n1:44:57.080 --> 1:45:00.080\n in the general home environment or in general world.\n\n1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:02.080\n And that's kind of adorable.\n\n1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:06.080\n And that's like, those are your flaws and you fall in love with those flaws.\n\n1:45:06.080 --> 1:45:09.080\n So it's very different than autonomous driving\n\n1:45:09.080 --> 1:45:13.080\n where it's a very high stakes environment you cannot mess up.\n\n1:45:13.080 --> 1:45:17.080\n And so it's more fun to be a robot in the home.\n\n1:45:17.080 --> 1:45:21.080\n Yeah, in fact, if you think of like C3PO and R2D2,\n\n1:45:21.080 --> 1:45:24.080\n like they actually had a lot of like flaws and imperfections\n\n1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:29.080\n and silly things and they would argue with each other.\n\n1:45:29.080 --> 1:45:32.080\n Were they actually good at doing anything?\n\n1:45:32.080 --> 1:45:34.080\n I'm not exactly sure.\n\n1:45:34.080 --> 1:45:38.080\n They definitely added a lot to the story.\n\n1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:43.080\n But there's sort of quirky elements and, you know,\n\n1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:45.080\n that they would like make mistakes and do things.\n\n1:45:45.080 --> 1:45:52.080\n It was like it made them relatable, I don't know, enduring.\n\n1:45:52.080 --> 1:45:59.080\n So yeah, I think that that could be something that probably would happen.\n\n1:45:59.080 --> 1:46:03.080\n But our initial focus is just to make it useful.\n\n1:46:03.080 --> 1:46:06.080\n So I'm confident we'll get it done.\n\n1:46:06.080 --> 1:46:08.080\n I'm not sure what the exact timeframe is,\n\n1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:11.080\n but like we'll probably have, I don't know,\n\n1:46:11.080 --> 1:46:15.080\n a decent prototype towards the end of next year or something like that.\n\n1:46:15.080 --> 1:46:19.080\n And it's cool that it's connected to Tesla, the car.\n\n1:46:19.080 --> 1:46:22.080\n Yeah, it's using a lot of, you know,\n\n1:46:22.080 --> 1:46:25.080\n it would use the autopilot inference computer\n\n1:46:25.080 --> 1:46:29.080\n and a lot of the training that we've done for cars\n\n1:46:29.080 --> 1:46:32.080\n in terms of recognizing real world things\n\n1:46:32.080 --> 1:46:38.080\n could be applied directly to the robot.\n\n1:46:38.080 --> 1:46:42.080\n But there's a lot of custom actuators and sensors that need to be developed.\n\n1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:47.080\n And an extra module on top of the vector space for love.\n\n1:46:47.080 --> 1:46:48.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:51.080\n That's what I'm saying.\n\n1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:53.080\n We can add that to the car too.\n\n1:46:53.080 --> 1:46:55.080\n That's true.\n\n1:46:55.080 --> 1:46:57.080\n Yeah, it could be useful in all environments.\n\n1:46:57.080 --> 1:46:59.080\n Like you said, a lot of people argue in the car,\n\n1:46:59.080 --> 1:47:02.080\n so maybe we can help them out.\n\n1:47:02.080 --> 1:47:03.080\n You're a student of history,\n\n1:47:03.080 --> 1:47:06.080\n fan of Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast.\n\n1:47:06.080 --> 1:47:07.080\n Yeah, it's great.\n\n1:47:07.080 --> 1:47:08.080\n Greatest podcast ever?\n\n1:47:08.080 --> 1:47:11.080\n Yeah, I think it is actually.\n\n1:47:11.080 --> 1:47:14.080\n It almost doesn't really count as a podcast.\n\n1:47:14.080 --> 1:47:16.080\n It's more like an audio book.\n\n1:47:16.080 --> 1:47:18.080\n So you were on the podcast with Dan.\n\n1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:21.080\n I just had a chat with him about it.\n\n1:47:21.080 --> 1:47:23.080\n He said you guys went military and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:47:23.080 --> 1:47:32.080\n Yeah, it was basically, it should be titled Engineer Wars, essentially.\n\n1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:36.080\n Like when there's a rapid change in the rate of technology,\n\n1:47:36.080 --> 1:47:43.080\n then engineering plays a pivotal role in victory and battle.\n\n1:47:43.080 --> 1:47:45.080\n How far back in history did you go?\n\n1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:47.080\n Did you go World War II?\n\n1:47:47.080 --> 1:47:55.080\n Well, it was supposed to be a deep dive on fighters and bomber technology in World War II,\n\n1:47:55.080 --> 1:47:58.080\n but that ended up being more wide ranging than that,\n\n1:47:58.080 --> 1:48:04.080\n because I just went down the total rathole of studying all of the fighters and bombers of World War II\n\n1:48:04.080 --> 1:48:10.080\n and the constant rock, paper, scissors game that one country would make this plane,\n\n1:48:10.080 --> 1:48:15.080\n then it would make a plane to beat that, and that country would make a plane to beat that.\n\n1:48:15.080 --> 1:48:18.080\n And really what matters is the pace of innovation\n\n1:48:18.080 --> 1:48:25.080\n and also access to high quality fuel and raw materials.\n\n1:48:25.080 --> 1:48:29.080\n Germany had some amazing designs, but they couldn't make them\n\n1:48:29.080 --> 1:48:31.080\n because they couldn't get the raw materials,\n\n1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:37.080\n and they had a real problem with the oil and fuel, basically.\n\n1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:40.080\n The fuel quality was extremely variable.\n\n1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:42.080\n So the design wasn't the bottleneck?\n\n1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:47.080\n Yeah, the U.S. had kickass fuel that was very consistent.\n\n1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:50.080\n The problem is if you make a very high performance aircraft engine,\n\n1:48:50.080 --> 1:48:59.080\n in order to make it high performance, the fuel, the aviation gas,\n\n1:48:59.080 --> 1:49:07.080\n has to be a consistent mixture and it has to have a high octane.\n\n1:49:07.080 --> 1:49:11.080\n High octane is the most important thing, but it also can't have impurities and stuff\n\n1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:14.080\n because you'll foul up the engine.\n\n1:49:14.080 --> 1:49:16.080\n And Germany just never had good access to oil.\n\n1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:22.080\n They tried to get it by invading the Caucasus, but that didn't work too well.\n\n1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:23.080\n It never worked so well.\n\n1:49:23.080 --> 1:49:24.080\n It didn't work out for them.\n\n1:49:24.080 --> 1:49:26.080\n See you, Jerry.\n\n1:49:26.080 --> 1:49:28.080\n Nice to meet you.\n\n1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:31.080\n Germany was always struggling with basically shitty oil,\n\n1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:37.080\n and they couldn't count on high quality fuel for their aircraft,\n\n1:49:37.080 --> 1:49:43.080\n so they had to have all these additives and stuff.\n\n1:49:43.080 --> 1:49:48.080\n Whereas the U.S. had awesome fuel, and they provided that to Britain as well.\n\n1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:53.080\n So that allowed the British and the Americans to design aircraft engines\n\n1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:58.080\n that were super high performance, better than anything else in the world.\n\n1:49:58.080 --> 1:50:01.080\n Germany could design the engines, they just didn't have the fuel.\n\n1:50:01.080 --> 1:50:06.080\n And then also the quality of the aluminum alloys that they were getting\n\n1:50:06.080 --> 1:50:09.080\n was also not that great.\n\n1:50:09.080 --> 1:50:11.080\n Is this like, you talked about all this with Dan?\n\n1:50:11.080 --> 1:50:12.080\n Yep.\n\n1:50:12.080 --> 1:50:13.080\n Awesome.\n\n1:50:13.080 --> 1:50:16.080\n Broadly looking at history, when you look at Genghis Khan,\n\n1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:22.080\n when you look at Stalin, Hitler, the darkest moments of human history,\n\n1:50:22.080 --> 1:50:24.080\n what do you take away from those moments?\n\n1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:28.080\n Does it help you gain insight about human nature, about human behavior today,\n\n1:50:28.080 --> 1:50:32.080\n whether it's the wars or the individuals or just the behavior of people,\n\n1:50:32.080 --> 1:50:41.080\n any aspects of history?\n\n1:50:41.080 --> 1:50:49.080\n Yeah, I find history fascinating.\n\n1:50:49.080 --> 1:50:54.080\n There's just a lot of incredible things that have been done, good and bad,\n\n1:50:54.080 --> 1:51:06.080\n that they help you understand the nature of civilization and individuals.\n\n1:51:06.080 --> 1:51:09.080\n Does it make you sad that humans do these kinds of things to each other?\n\n1:51:09.080 --> 1:51:15.080\n You look at the 20th century, World War II, the cruelty, the abuse of power,\n\n1:51:15.080 --> 1:51:20.080\n talk about communism, Marxism, and Stalin.\n\n1:51:20.080 --> 1:51:24.080\n I mean, there's a lot of human history.\n\n1:51:24.080 --> 1:51:28.080\n Most of it is actually people just getting on with their lives,\n\n1:51:28.080 --> 1:51:35.080\n and it's not like human history is just nonstop war and disaster.\n\n1:51:35.080 --> 1:51:38.080\n Those are actually just, those are intermittent and rare.\n\n1:51:38.080 --> 1:51:46.080\n If they weren't, then humans would soon cease to exist.\n\n1:51:46.080 --> 1:51:50.080\n But it's just that wars tend to be written about a lot,\n\n1:51:50.080 --> 1:51:54.080\n whereas something being like, well,\n\n1:51:54.080 --> 1:51:58.080\n a normal year where nothing major happened doesn't get written about much.\n\n1:51:58.080 --> 1:52:04.080\n But that's, most people just like farming and kind of living their life,\n\n1:52:04.080 --> 1:52:09.080\n being a villager somewhere.\n\n1:52:09.080 --> 1:52:16.080\n And every now and again, there's a war.\n\n1:52:16.080 --> 1:52:23.080\n And I would have to say, there aren't very many books where I just had to stop reading\n\n1:52:23.080 --> 1:52:26.080\n because it was just too dark.\n\n1:52:26.080 --> 1:52:32.080\n But the book about Stalin, The Court of the Red Tsar, I had to stop reading.\n\n1:52:32.080 --> 1:52:37.080\n It was just too dark and rough.\n\n1:52:37.080 --> 1:52:39.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:52:39.080 --> 1:52:44.080\n The 30s, there's a lot of lessons there to me,\n\n1:52:44.080 --> 1:52:48.080\n in particular that it feels like humans,\n\n1:52:48.080 --> 1:52:53.080\n like all of us have that, it's the old Solzhenitsyn line,\n\n1:52:53.080 --> 1:52:56.080\n that the line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man,\n\n1:52:56.080 --> 1:52:59.080\n that all of us are capable of evil, all of us are capable of good.\n\n1:52:59.080 --> 1:53:04.080\n It's almost like this kind of responsibility that all of us have\n\n1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:07.080\n to tend towards the good.\n\n1:53:07.080 --> 1:53:11.080\n And so to me, looking at history is almost like an example of,\n\n1:53:11.080 --> 1:53:16.080\n look, you have some charismatic leader that convinces you of things.\n\n1:53:16.080 --> 1:53:21.080\n It's too easy, based on that story, to do evil onto each other,\n\n1:53:21.080 --> 1:53:23.080\n onto your family, onto others.\n\n1:53:23.080 --> 1:53:26.080\n And so it's like our responsibility to do good.\n\n1:53:26.080 --> 1:53:29.080\n It's not like now is somehow different from history.\n\n1:53:29.080 --> 1:53:32.080\n That can happen again. All of it can happen again.\n\n1:53:32.080 --> 1:53:35.080\n And yes, most of the time, you're right,\n\n1:53:35.080 --> 1:53:39.080\n the optimistic view here is mostly people are just living life.\n\n1:53:39.080 --> 1:53:44.080\n And as you've often memed about, the quality of life was way worse\n\n1:53:44.080 --> 1:53:47.080\n back in the day, and this keeps improving over time\n\n1:53:47.080 --> 1:53:49.080\n through innovation, through technology.\n\n1:53:49.080 --> 1:53:54.080\n But still, it's somehow notable that these blimps of atrocities happen.\n\n1:53:54.080 --> 1:53:56.080\n Sure.\n\n1:53:56.080 --> 1:54:02.080\n Yeah, I mean, life was really tough for most of history.\n\n1:54:02.080 --> 1:54:07.080\n I mean, for most of human history, a good year would be one\n\n1:54:07.080 --> 1:54:11.080\n where not that many people in your village died of the plague,\n\n1:54:11.080 --> 1:54:16.080\n starvation, freezing to death, or being killed by a neighboring village.\n\n1:54:16.080 --> 1:54:18.080\n It's like, well, it wasn't that bad.\n\n1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:20.080\n It was only like we lost 5% this year.\n\n1:54:20.080 --> 1:54:23.080\n That was a good year.\n\n1:54:23.080 --> 1:54:25.080\n That would be par for the course.\n\n1:54:25.080 --> 1:54:28.080\n Just not starving to death would have been the primary goal\n\n1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:31.080\n of most people throughout history,\n\n1:54:31.080 --> 1:54:34.080\n is making sure we'll have enough food to last through the winter\n\n1:54:34.080 --> 1:54:36.080\n and not freeze or whatever.\n\n1:54:36.080 --> 1:54:42.080\n So, now food is plentiful.\n\n1:54:42.080 --> 1:54:46.080\n I have an obesity problem.\n\n1:54:46.080 --> 1:54:50.080\n Well, yeah, the lesson there is to be grateful for the way things are now\n\n1:54:50.080 --> 1:54:53.080\n for some of us.\n\n1:54:53.080 --> 1:54:56.080\n We've spoken about this offline.\n\n1:54:56.080 --> 1:55:00.080\n I'd love to get your thought about it here.\n\n1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:05.080\n If I sat down for a long form in person conversation with the President of Russia,\n\n1:55:05.080 --> 1:55:10.080\n Vladimir Putin, would you potentially want to call in for a few minutes\n\n1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:15.080\n to join in on a conversation with him, moderated and translated by me?\n\n1:55:15.080 --> 1:55:16.080\n Sure, yeah.\n\n1:55:16.080 --> 1:55:19.080\n Sure, I'd be happy to do that.\n\n1:55:19.080 --> 1:55:22.080\n You've shown interest in the Russian language.\n\n1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:27.080\n Is this grounded in your interest in history of linguistics, culture, general curiosity?\n\n1:55:27.080 --> 1:55:29.080\n I think it sounds cool.\n\n1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:32.080\n Sounds cool and that looks cool.\n\n1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:39.080\n Well, it takes a moment to read Cyrillic.\n\n1:55:39.080 --> 1:55:43.080\n Once you know what the Cyrillic characters stand for,\n\n1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:47.080\n actually then reading Russian becomes a lot easier\n\n1:55:47.080 --> 1:55:49.080\n because there are a lot of words that are actually the same.\n\n1:55:49.080 --> 1:55:54.080\n Like bank is bank.\n\n1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:59.080\n So find the words that are exactly the same and now you start to understand Cyrillic.\n\n1:55:59.080 --> 1:56:06.080\n If you can sound it out, there's at least some commonality of words.\n\n1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:09.080\n What about the culture?\n\n1:56:09.080 --> 1:56:12.080\n You love great engineering, physics.\n\n1:56:12.080 --> 1:56:14.080\n There's a tradition of the sciences there.\n\n1:56:14.080 --> 1:56:17.080\n You look at the 20th century from rocketry.\n\n1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:24.080\n Some of the greatest rockets, some of the space exploration has been done in the former Soviet Union.\n\n1:56:24.080 --> 1:56:27.080\n So do you draw inspiration from that history?\n\n1:56:27.080 --> 1:56:33.080\n Just how this culture that in many ways, one of the sad things is because of the language,\n\n1:56:33.080 --> 1:56:37.080\n a lot of it is lost to history because it's not translated.\n\n1:56:37.080 --> 1:56:40.080\n Because it is in some ways an isolated culture.\n\n1:56:40.080 --> 1:56:45.080\n It flourishes within its borders.\n\n1:56:45.080 --> 1:56:51.080\n So do you draw inspiration from those folks, from the history of science engineering there?\n\n1:56:51.080 --> 1:57:02.080\n The Soviet Union, Russia and Ukraine as well have a really strong history in space flight.\n\n1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:11.080\n Some of the most advanced and impressive things in history were done by the Soviet Union.\n\n1:57:11.080 --> 1:57:20.080\n So one cannot help but admire the impressive rocket technology that was developed.\n\n1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:29.080\n After the fall of the Soviet Union, there's much less that then happened.\n\n1:57:29.080 --> 1:57:46.080\n But still things are happening, but it's not quite at the frenetic pace that it was happening before the Soviet Union kind of dissolved into separate republics.\n\n1:57:46.080 --> 1:57:52.080\n Yeah, there's Roscosmos, the Russian agency.\n\n1:57:52.080 --> 1:57:57.080\n I look forward to a time when those countries with China are working together.\n\n1:57:57.080 --> 1:58:00.080\n The United States are all working together.\n\n1:58:00.080 --> 1:58:02.080\n Maybe a little bit of friendly competition.\n\n1:58:02.080 --> 1:58:04.080\n I think friendly competition is good.\n\n1:58:04.080 --> 1:58:09.080\n Governments are slow and the only thing slower than one government is a collection of governments.\n\n1:58:09.080 --> 1:58:16.080\n So the Olympics would be boring if everyone just crossed the finishing line at the same time.\n\n1:58:16.080 --> 1:58:18.080\n Nobody would watch.\n\n1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:22.080\n And people wouldn't try hard to run fast and stuff.\n\n1:58:22.080 --> 1:58:25.080\n So I think friendly competition is a good thing.\n\n1:58:25.080 --> 1:58:29.080\n This is also a good place to give a shout out to a video titled,\n\n1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:34.080\n The Entire Soviet Rocket Engine Family Tree by Tim Dodd, AKA Everyday Astronaut.\n\n1:58:34.080 --> 1:58:35.080\n It's like an hour and a half.\n\n1:58:35.080 --> 1:58:38.080\n It gives the full history of Soviet rockets.\n\n1:58:38.080 --> 1:58:41.080\n And people should definitely go check out and support Tim in general.\n\n1:58:41.080 --> 1:58:45.080\n That guy is super excited about the future, super excited about space flight.\n\n1:58:45.080 --> 1:58:50.080\n Every time I see anything by him, I just have a stupid smile on my face because he's so excited about stuff.\n\n1:58:50.080 --> 1:58:53.080\n Yeah, Tim Dodd is really great.\n\n1:58:53.080 --> 1:59:02.080\n If you're interested in anything to do with space, he's, in terms of explaining rocket technology to your average person, he's awesome.\n\n1:59:02.080 --> 1:59:04.080\n The best, I'd say.\n\n1:59:04.080 --> 1:59:14.080\n And I should say like the part of the reason like I switched us from like Rafter at one point was going to be a hydrogen engine.\n\n1:59:14.080 --> 1:59:17.080\n But hydrogen has a lot of challenges.\n\n1:59:17.080 --> 1:59:18.080\n It's very low density.\n\n1:59:18.080 --> 1:59:19.080\n It's a deep cryogen.\n\n1:59:19.080 --> 1:59:23.080\n So it's only liquid at a very, very close to absolute zero.\n\n1:59:23.080 --> 1:59:26.080\n Requires a lot of insulation.\n\n1:59:26.080 --> 1:59:30.080\n So it is a lot of challenges there.\n\n1:59:30.080 --> 1:59:35.080\n And I was actually reading a bit about Russian rocket engine developments.\n\n1:59:35.080 --> 1:59:50.080\n And at least the impression I had was that the Soviet Union, Russia and Ukraine primarily were actually in the process of switching to Methalox.\n\n1:59:50.080 --> 1:59:55.080\n And there were some interesting tests and data for ISP.\n\n1:59:55.080 --> 2:00:01.080\n Like they were able to get like up to like a 380 second ISP with the Methalox engine.\n\n2:00:01.080 --> 2:00:05.080\n And I was like, well, OK, that's actually really impressive.\n\n2:00:05.080 --> 2:00:19.080\n So I think you could actually get a much lower cost, like in optimizing cost per ton to orbit, cost per ton to Mars.\n\n2:00:19.080 --> 2:00:25.080\n I think Methalox is the way to go.\n\n2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:32.080\n And I was partly inspired by the Russian work on the test stands with Methalox engines.\n\n2:00:32.080 --> 2:00:35.080\n And now for something completely different.\n\n2:00:35.080 --> 2:00:41.080\n Do you mind doing a bit of a meme review in the spirit of the great, the powerful PewDiePie?\n\n2:00:41.080 --> 2:00:42.080\n Let's say 1 to 11.\n\n2:00:42.080 --> 2:00:45.080\n Just go over a few documents printed out.\n\n2:00:45.080 --> 2:00:46.080\n We can try.\n\n2:00:46.080 --> 2:00:49.080\n Let's try this.\n\n2:00:49.080 --> 2:00:56.080\n I present to you document numero uno.\n\n2:00:56.080 --> 2:00:58.080\n I don't know. OK.\n\n2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:03.080\n Vladimir Impaler discovers marshmallows.\n\n2:01:03.080 --> 2:01:07.080\n That's not bad.\n\n2:01:07.080 --> 2:01:11.080\n So you get it? Because he likes impaling things.\n\n2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:12.080\n Yes, I get it.\n\n2:01:12.080 --> 2:01:14.080\n I don't know, three, whatever.\n\n2:01:14.080 --> 2:01:19.080\n That's not very good.\n\n2:01:19.080 --> 2:01:28.080\n This is grounded in some engineering, some history.\n\n2:01:28.080 --> 2:01:31.080\n Yeah, give us an eight out of ten.\n\n2:01:31.080 --> 2:01:33.080\n What do you think about nuclear power?\n\n2:01:33.080 --> 2:01:34.080\n I'm in favor of nuclear power.\n\n2:01:34.080 --> 2:01:47.080\n I think in a place that is not subject to extreme natural disasters, I think nuclear power is a great way to generate electricity.\n\n2:01:47.080 --> 2:01:51.080\n I don't think we should be shutting down nuclear power stations.\n\n2:01:51.080 --> 2:01:53.080\n Yeah, but what about Chernobyl?\n\n2:01:53.080 --> 2:01:56.080\n Exactly.\n\n2:01:56.080 --> 2:02:04.080\n I think there's a lot of fear of radiation and stuff.\n\n2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:13.080\n The problem is a lot of people just don't study engineering or physics.\n\n2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:16.080\n Just the word radiation just sounds scary.\n\n2:02:16.080 --> 2:02:21.080\n They can't calibrate what radiation means.\n\n2:02:21.080 --> 2:02:30.080\n But radiation is much less dangerous than you think.\n\n2:02:30.080 --> 2:02:41.080\n For example, Fukushima, when the Fukushima problem happened due to the tsunami,\n\n2:02:41.080 --> 2:02:46.080\n I got people in California asking me if they should worry about radiation from Fukushima.\n\n2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:51.080\n I'm like, definitely not, not even slightly, not at all.\n\n2:02:51.080 --> 2:02:54.080\n That is crazy.\n\n2:02:54.080 --> 2:03:09.080\n Just to show this is how the danger is so much overplayed compared to what it really is that I actually flew to Fukushima.\n\n2:03:09.080 --> 2:03:28.080\n I donated a solar power system for a water treatment plant, and I made a point of eating locally grown vegetables on TV in Fukushima.\n\n2:03:28.080 --> 2:03:31.080\n I'm still alive.\n\n2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:36.080\n So it's not even that the risk of these events is low, but the impact of them is...\n\n2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:38.080\n The impact is greatly exaggerated.\n\n2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:40.080\n It's human nature.\n\n2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:42.080\n People don't know what radiation is.\n\n2:03:42.080 --> 2:03:46.080\n I've had people ask me, what about radiation from cell phones causing brain cancer?\n\n2:03:46.080 --> 2:03:49.080\n I'm like, when you say radiation, do you mean photons or particles?\n\n2:03:49.080 --> 2:03:52.080\n They're like, I don't know, what do you mean photons or particles?\n\n2:03:52.080 --> 2:03:56.080\n Do you mean, let's say, photons?\n\n2:03:56.080 --> 2:03:59.080\n What frequency or wavelength?\n\n2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:01.080\n And they're like, I have no idea.\n\n2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:04.080\n Do you know that everything's radiating all the time?\n\n2:04:04.080 --> 2:04:06.080\n What do you mean?\n\n2:04:06.080 --> 2:04:08.080\n Like, yeah, everything's radiating all the time.\n\n2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:12.080\n Photons are being emitted by all objects all the time, basically.\n\n2:04:12.080 --> 2:04:21.080\n And if you want to know what it means to stand in front of nuclear fire, go outside.\n\n2:04:21.080 --> 2:04:28.080\n The sun is a gigantic thermonuclear reactor that you're staring right at it.\n\n2:04:28.080 --> 2:04:29.080\n Are you still alive?\n\n2:04:29.080 --> 2:04:30.080\n Yes.\n\n2:04:30.080 --> 2:04:32.080\n Okay, amazing.\n\n2:04:32.080 --> 2:04:39.080\n Yeah, I guess radiation is one of the words that could be used as a tool to fear monger by certain people.\n\n2:04:39.080 --> 2:04:40.080\n That's it.\n\n2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:42.080\n I think people just don't understand.\n\n2:04:42.080 --> 2:04:46.080\n I mean, that's the way to fight that fear, I suppose, is to understand, is to learn.\n\n2:04:46.080 --> 2:04:50.080\n Yeah, just say, okay, how many people have actually died from nuclear accidents?\n\n2:04:50.080 --> 2:04:51.080\n It's practically nothing.\n\n2:04:51.080 --> 2:04:57.080\n And say, how many people have died from coal plants?\n\n2:04:57.080 --> 2:04:59.080\n And it's a very big number.\n\n2:04:59.080 --> 2:05:05.080\n So, like, obviously we should not be starting up coal plants and shutting down nuclear plants.\n\n2:05:05.080 --> 2:05:08.080\n It just doesn't make any sense at all.\n\n2:05:08.080 --> 2:05:15.080\n Coal plants, like, I don't know, 100 to 1,000 times worse for health than nuclear power plants.\n\n2:05:15.080 --> 2:05:16.080\n You want to go to the next one?\n\n2:05:16.080 --> 2:05:20.080\n This is really bad.\n\n2:05:20.080 --> 2:05:24.080\n It's 90, 180, and 360 degrees.\n\n2:05:24.080 --> 2:05:25.080\n Everybody loves the math.\n\n2:05:25.080 --> 2:05:28.080\n Nobody gives a shit about 270.\n\n2:05:28.080 --> 2:05:30.080\n It's not super funny.\n\n2:05:30.080 --> 2:05:32.080\n I don't know, like, 203.\n\n2:05:32.080 --> 2:05:37.080\n This is not a, you know, LOL situation.\n\n2:05:37.080 --> 2:05:43.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:43.080 --> 2:05:44.080\n That was pretty good.\n\n2:05:44.080 --> 2:05:48.080\n The United States oscillating between establishing and destroying dictatorships.\n\n2:05:48.080 --> 2:05:49.080\n It's like a metronome.\n\n2:05:49.080 --> 2:05:50.080\n Is that a metronome?\n\n2:05:50.080 --> 2:05:53.080\n Yeah, it's out of 7 out of 10.\n\n2:05:53.080 --> 2:05:54.080\n It's kind of true.\n\n2:05:54.080 --> 2:05:57.080\n Oh, yeah, this is kind of personal for me.\n\n2:05:57.080 --> 2:05:58.080\n Next one.\n\n2:05:58.080 --> 2:05:59.080\n Oh, man.\n\n2:05:59.080 --> 2:06:00.080\n Is this Leica?\n\n2:06:00.080 --> 2:06:01.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:06:01.080 --> 2:06:02.080\n Well, no.\n\n2:06:02.080 --> 2:06:03.080\n Or it's like referring to Leica or something?\n\n2:06:03.080 --> 2:06:06.080\n As Leica's, like, husband.\n\n2:06:06.080 --> 2:06:07.080\n Husband.\n\n2:06:07.080 --> 2:06:08.080\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:06:08.080 --> 2:06:09.080\n Hello.\n\n2:06:09.080 --> 2:06:10.080\n Yes, this is dog.\n\n2:06:10.080 --> 2:06:11.080\n Your wife was launched into space.\n\n2:06:11.080 --> 2:06:16.080\n And then the last one is him with his eyes closed and a bottle of vodka.\n\n2:06:16.080 --> 2:06:17.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:06:17.080 --> 2:06:18.080\n Leica didn't come back.\n\n2:06:18.080 --> 2:06:19.080\n No.\n\n2:06:19.080 --> 2:06:24.080\n They don't tell you the full story of, you know, what the impact they had on the loved\n\n2:06:24.080 --> 2:06:25.080\n ones.\n\n2:06:25.080 --> 2:06:26.080\n True.\n\n2:06:26.080 --> 2:06:27.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:06:27.080 --> 2:06:28.080\n It's like 711 for me.\n\n2:06:28.080 --> 2:06:29.080\n Sure.\n\n2:06:29.080 --> 2:06:30.080\n The Soviet shadow.\n\n2:06:30.080 --> 2:06:31.080\n Oh, yeah.\n\n2:06:31.080 --> 2:06:33.400\n This keeps going on the Russian theme.\n\n2:06:33.400 --> 2:06:35.160\n First man in space.\n\n2:06:35.160 --> 2:06:36.160\n Nobody cares.\n\n2:06:36.160 --> 2:06:37.160\n First man on the moon.\n\n2:06:37.160 --> 2:06:38.160\n Well, I think people do care.\n\n2:06:38.160 --> 2:06:39.160\n No, I know.\n\n2:06:39.160 --> 2:06:40.160\n But...\n\n2:06:40.160 --> 2:06:41.160\n There is...\n\n2:06:41.160 --> 2:06:45.760\n Yuri Gagarin's name will be forever in history, I think.\n\n2:06:45.760 --> 2:06:52.080\n There is something special about placing, like, stepping foot onto another totally foreign\n\n2:06:52.080 --> 2:06:53.080\n land.\n\n2:06:53.080 --> 2:06:56.960\n It's not the journey, like, people that explore the oceans.\n\n2:06:56.960 --> 2:07:01.400\n It's not as important to explore the oceans as to land on a whole new continent.\n\n2:07:01.400 --> 2:07:02.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:07:02.400 --> 2:07:05.080\n Well, this is about you.\n\n2:07:05.080 --> 2:07:08.200\n Oh, yeah, I'd love to get your comment on this.\n\n2:07:08.200 --> 2:07:14.680\n Elon Musk, after sending 6.6 billion dollars to the UN to end world hunger, you have three\n\n2:07:14.680 --> 2:07:15.680\n hours.\n\n2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:24.240\n Yeah, well, I mean, obviously, 6 billion dollars is not going to end world hunger.\n\n2:07:24.240 --> 2:07:30.680\n So I mean, the reality is at this point, the world is producing far more food than it can\n\n2:07:30.680 --> 2:07:31.680\n really consume.\n\n2:07:31.680 --> 2:07:35.920\n Like, we don't have a caloric constraint at this point.\n\n2:07:35.920 --> 2:07:43.280\n So where there is hunger, it is almost always due to, like, civil war or strife or some\n\n2:07:43.280 --> 2:07:52.860\n like, it's not a thing that is extremely rare for it to be just a matter of, like, lack\n\n2:07:52.860 --> 2:07:53.860\n of money.\n\n2:07:53.860 --> 2:07:59.000\n It's like, you know, it's like some civil war in some country and like one part of the\n\n2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:03.040\n country is literally trying to starve the other part of the country.\n\n2:08:03.040 --> 2:08:05.840\n So it's much more complex than something that money could solve.\n\n2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:07.440\n It's geopolitics.\n\n2:08:07.440 --> 2:08:09.840\n It's a lot of things.\n\n2:08:09.840 --> 2:08:10.840\n It's human nature.\n\n2:08:10.840 --> 2:08:11.840\n It's governments.\n\n2:08:11.840 --> 2:08:14.520\n It's money, monetary systems, all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:08:14.520 --> 2:08:17.640\n Yeah, food is extremely cheap these days.\n\n2:08:17.640 --> 2:08:26.720\n It's like, I mean, the US at this point, you know, among low income families, obesity is\n\n2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:27.960\n actually another problem.\n\n2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:31.120\n It's not, like, obesity, it's not hunger.\n\n2:08:31.120 --> 2:08:34.660\n It's like too much, you know, too many calories.\n\n2:08:34.660 --> 2:08:37.880\n So it's not that nobody's hungry anywhere.\n\n2:08:37.880 --> 2:08:43.960\n It's just, this is not a simple matter of adding money and solving it.\n\n2:08:43.960 --> 2:08:44.960\n Hmm.\n\n2:08:44.960 --> 2:08:48.800\n What do you think that one gets?\n\n2:08:48.800 --> 2:08:49.800\n It's getting...\n\n2:08:49.800 --> 2:08:50.800\n Two.\n\n2:08:50.800 --> 2:08:57.560\n We're just going after empires, world, where did you get those artifacts?\n\n2:08:57.560 --> 2:08:58.560\n The British Museum.\n\n2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:01.600\n Shout out to Monty Python.\n\n2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:02.600\n We found them.\n\n2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:03.600\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:03.600 --> 2:09:05.800\n The British Museum is pretty great.\n\n2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:10.200\n I mean, admittedly Britain did take these historical artifacts from all around the world\n\n2:09:10.200 --> 2:09:16.120\n and put them in London, but, you know, it's not like people can't go see them.\n\n2:09:16.120 --> 2:09:23.480\n So it is a convenient place to see these ancient artifacts is London for, you know, for a large\n\n2:09:23.480 --> 2:09:25.080\n segment of the world.\n\n2:09:25.080 --> 2:09:29.640\n So I think, you know, on balance, the British Museum is a net good, although I'm sure a\n\n2:09:29.640 --> 2:09:31.440\n lot of countries will argue about that.\n\n2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:32.440\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:32.440 --> 2:09:35.960\n It's like you want to make these historical artifacts accessible to as many people as\n\n2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:41.520\n possible and the British Museum, I think, does a good job of that.\n\n2:09:41.520 --> 2:09:45.200\n Even if there's a darker aspect to like the history of empire in general, whatever the\n\n2:09:45.200 --> 2:09:52.120\n empire is, however things were done, it is the history that happened.\n\n2:09:52.120 --> 2:09:54.280\n You can't sort of erase that history, unfortunately.\n\n2:09:54.280 --> 2:09:55.920\n You could just become better in the future.\n\n2:09:55.920 --> 2:09:57.520\n That's the point.\n\n2:09:57.520 --> 2:09:58.520\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:58.520 --> 2:10:04.040\n I mean, it's like, well, how are we going to pass moral judgment on these things?\n\n2:10:04.040 --> 2:10:10.400\n Like it's like if, you know, if one is going to judge, say, the Russian Empire, you've\n\n2:10:10.400 --> 2:10:14.720\n got to judge, you know, what everyone was doing at the time and how were the British\n\n2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:18.200\n relative to everyone.\n\n2:10:18.200 --> 2:10:22.640\n And I think the British would actually get like a relatively good grade, relatively good\n\n2:10:22.640 --> 2:10:30.040\n grade, not in absolute terms, but compared to what everyone else was doing, they were\n\n2:10:30.040 --> 2:10:31.600\n not the worst.\n\n2:10:31.600 --> 2:10:35.400\n Like I said, you got to look at these things in the context of the history at the time\n\n2:10:35.400 --> 2:10:39.200\n and say, what were the alternatives and what are you comparing it against?\n\n2:10:39.200 --> 2:10:47.220\n And I do not think it would be the case that Britain would get a bad grade when looking\n\n2:10:47.220 --> 2:10:48.560\n at history at the time.\n\n2:10:48.560 --> 2:10:56.280\n You know, if you judge history from, you know, from what is morally acceptable today, you\n\n2:10:56.280 --> 2:10:58.400\n basically are going to give everyone a failing grade.\n\n2:10:58.400 --> 2:10:59.400\n I'm not clear.\n\n2:10:59.400 --> 2:11:04.720\n It's not, I don't think anyone would get a passing grade in their morality of like you\n\n2:11:04.720 --> 2:11:08.960\n could go back 300 years ago, like who's getting a passing grade?\n\n2:11:08.960 --> 2:11:10.760\n Basically no one.\n\n2:11:10.760 --> 2:11:16.280\n And we might not get a passing grade from generations that come after us.\n\n2:11:16.280 --> 2:11:18.880\n What does that one get?\n\n2:11:18.880 --> 2:11:19.880\n Sure.\n\n2:11:19.880 --> 2:11:20.880\n Six, seven.\n\n2:11:20.880 --> 2:11:21.880\n For the Monty Python, maybe.\n\n2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:22.880\n I always love Monty Python.\n\n2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:23.880\n They're great.\n\n2:11:23.880 --> 2:11:28.880\n The Life of Brian and the Quest of the Holy Grail are incredible.\n\n2:11:28.880 --> 2:11:29.880\n Yeah.\n\n2:11:29.880 --> 2:11:30.880\n Yeah.\n\n2:11:30.880 --> 2:11:31.880\n Yeah.\n\n2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:32.880\n Those serious eyebrows.\n\n2:11:32.880 --> 2:11:37.480\n How important do you think is facial hair to great leadership?\n\n2:11:37.480 --> 2:11:41.480\n Well, you got a new haircut.\n\n2:11:41.480 --> 2:11:42.480\n How does that affect your leadership?\n\n2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:43.480\n I don't know.\n\n2:11:43.480 --> 2:11:44.480\n Hopefully not.\n\n2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:45.480\n It doesn't.\n\n2:11:45.480 --> 2:11:46.480\n Is that the second no one?\n\n2:11:46.480 --> 2:11:47.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:48.480\n The second is no one.\n\n2:11:48.480 --> 2:11:49.480\n There is no one competing with Brezhnev.\n\n2:11:49.480 --> 2:11:50.480\n No one, too.\n\n2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:51.480\n Those are like epic eyebrows.\n\n2:11:51.480 --> 2:11:52.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:11:52.480 --> 2:11:53.480\n Sure.\n\n2:11:53.480 --> 2:11:54.480\n That's ridiculous.\n\n2:11:54.480 --> 2:11:55.480\n Give it a six or seven, I don't know.\n\n2:11:55.480 --> 2:11:56.480\n I like this Shakespearean analysis of memes.\n\n2:11:56.480 --> 2:11:57.480\n Brezhnev, he had a flair for drama as well.\n\n2:11:57.480 --> 2:11:58.480\n Like, you know, showmanship.\n\n2:11:58.480 --> 2:11:59.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:11:59.480 --> 2:12:00.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:00.480 --> 2:12:01.480\n It must come from the eyebrows.\n\n2:12:01.480 --> 2:12:02.480\n All right.\n\n2:12:02.480 --> 2:12:20.960\n Invention, great engineering, look what I invented, that's the best thing since ripped\n\n2:12:20.960 --> 2:12:21.960\n up bread.\n\n2:12:21.960 --> 2:12:22.960\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:22.960 --> 2:12:29.000\n Because they invented sliced bread, am I just explaining memes at this point?\n\n2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:40.000\n This is where my life has become a meme, what it like, you know, like a scribe that like\n\n2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:44.120\n runs around with the kings and just like writes down memes.\n\n2:12:44.120 --> 2:12:46.280\n I mean, when was the cheeseburger invented?\n\n2:12:46.280 --> 2:12:47.280\n That's like an epic invention.\n\n2:12:47.280 --> 2:12:48.280\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:48.280 --> 2:12:49.280\n Like, like, wow.\n\n2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:50.280\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:50.280 --> 2:12:57.680\n Versus just like a burger or a burger, I guess a burger in general is like, you know, then\n\n2:12:57.680 --> 2:13:01.800\n there's like, what is a burger, what's a sandwich, and then you start getting a pizza sandwich\n\n2:13:01.800 --> 2:13:05.720\n and what is the original, it gets into an ontology argument.\n\n2:13:05.720 --> 2:13:06.720\n Yeah.\n\n2:13:06.720 --> 2:13:08.920\n But everybody knows like if you order like a burger or cheeseburger or whatever and you\n\n2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:14.000\n like, you got like, you know, tomato and some lettuce and onions and whatever and, you know,\n\n2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:16.040\n mayor and ketchup and mustard, it's like epic.\n\n2:13:16.040 --> 2:13:17.040\n Yeah.\n\n2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:21.080\n But I'm sure they've had bread and meat separately for a long time and it was kind of a burger\n\n2:13:21.080 --> 2:13:25.960\n on the same plate, but somebody who actually combined them into the same thing and then\n\n2:13:25.960 --> 2:13:29.040\n you bite it and hold it makes it convenient.\n\n2:13:29.040 --> 2:13:30.040\n It's a materials problem.\n\n2:13:30.040 --> 2:13:31.040\n Yeah.\n\n2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:33.520\n Like your hands don't get dirty and whatever.\n\n2:13:33.520 --> 2:13:34.520\n Yeah.\n\n2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:35.520\n It's brilliant.\n\n2:13:35.520 --> 2:13:43.280\n Well, that is not what I would have guessed, but everyone knows like you, if you order\n\n2:13:43.280 --> 2:13:46.800\n a cheeseburger, you know what you're getting, you know, it's not like some obtuse, like,\n\n2:13:46.800 --> 2:13:52.800\n well, I wonder what I'll get, you know, um, you know, uh, fries are, I mean, great.\n\n2:13:52.800 --> 2:13:56.320\n I mean, they were the devil, but fries are awesome.\n\n2:13:56.320 --> 2:14:00.320\n And uh, yeah, pizza is incredible.\n\n2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:05.480\n Food innovation doesn't get enough love, I guess is what we're getting at.\n\n2:14:05.480 --> 2:14:06.480\n Great.\n\n2:14:06.480 --> 2:14:13.520\n Um, uh, what about the, uh, Matthew McConaughey, Austinite here, uh, president Kennedy, do\n\n2:14:13.520 --> 2:14:15.200\n you know how to put men on the moon yet?\n\n2:14:15.200 --> 2:14:16.200\n NASA?\n\n2:14:16.200 --> 2:14:17.200\n No.\n\n2:14:17.200 --> 2:14:19.440\n President Kennedy, it'd be a lot cooler if you did.\n\n2:14:19.440 --> 2:14:25.360\n Pretty much sure, six, six or seven, I suppose.\n\n2:14:25.360 --> 2:14:26.360\n All right.\n\n2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:30.880\n And this is the last one that's funny.\n\n2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:35.680\n Someone drew a bunch of dicks all over the walls, 16 chapel boys bath.\n\n2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:36.680\n Sure.\n\n2:14:36.680 --> 2:14:37.680\n I'll give it a nine.\n\n2:14:37.680 --> 2:14:38.680\n It's super.\n\n2:14:38.680 --> 2:14:39.680\n It's really true.\n\n2:14:39.680 --> 2:14:40.680\n All right.\n\n2:14:40.680 --> 2:14:41.680\n This is our highest ranking meme for today.\n\n2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:42.680\n I mean, it's true.\n\n2:14:42.680 --> 2:14:44.880\n Like, how do they get away with it?\n\n2:14:44.880 --> 2:14:45.880\n Lots of nakedness.\n\n2:14:45.880 --> 2:14:49.640\n I mean, dick pics are, I mean, just something throughout history.\n\n2:14:49.640 --> 2:14:53.080\n Uh, as long as people can draw things, there's been a dick pic.\n\n2:14:53.080 --> 2:14:55.080\n It's a staple of human history.\n\n2:14:55.080 --> 2:14:56.080\n It's a staple.\n\n2:14:56.080 --> 2:14:58.840\n It's just throughout human history.\n\n2:14:58.840 --> 2:15:00.680\n You tweeted that you aspire to comedy.\n\n2:15:00.680 --> 2:15:02.640\n You're friends with Joe Rogan.\n\n2:15:02.640 --> 2:15:08.080\n Might you, uh, do a short standup comedy set at some point in the future, maybe, um, open\n\n2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:09.640\n for Joe, something like that.\n\n2:15:09.640 --> 2:15:10.640\n Is that, is that...\n\n2:15:10.640 --> 2:15:11.640\n Really?\n\n2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:12.640\n Standup?\n\n2:15:12.640 --> 2:15:13.640\n Actual, just full on standup?\n\n2:15:13.640 --> 2:15:14.640\n Full on standup.\n\n2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:15.640\n Is that in there or is that...\n\n2:15:15.640 --> 2:15:22.840\n It's extremely difficult if, uh, at least that's what, uh, like Joe says and the comedians\n\n2:15:22.840 --> 2:15:23.840\n say.\n\n2:15:23.840 --> 2:15:24.840\n Huh.\n\n2:15:24.840 --> 2:15:32.880\n I wonder if I could, um, I mean, I, I, you know, I, I have done standup for friends,\n\n2:15:32.880 --> 2:15:40.320\n just, uh, impromptu, you know, I'll get, get on like a roof, uh, and they, they do laugh,\n\n2:15:40.320 --> 2:15:41.440\n but they're our friends too.\n\n2:15:41.440 --> 2:15:45.320\n So I don't know if, if you've got to call, you know, like a room of strangers, are they\n\n2:15:45.320 --> 2:15:51.400\n going to actually also find it funny, but I could try, see what happens.\n\n2:15:51.400 --> 2:15:53.560\n I think you'd learn something either way.\n\n2:15:53.560 --> 2:15:54.560\n Um, yeah.\n\n2:15:54.560 --> 2:16:00.080\n I kind of love, um, both the, when you bomb and when, when you do great, just watching\n\n2:16:00.080 --> 2:16:03.320\n people, how they deal with it, it's so difficult.\n\n2:16:03.320 --> 2:16:07.000\n It's so, you're so fragile up there.\n\n2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:09.760\n It's just you and you, you think you're going to be funny.\n\n2:16:09.760 --> 2:16:14.400\n And when it completely falls flat, it's just, it's beautiful to see people deal with like\n\n2:16:14.400 --> 2:16:15.400\n that.\n\n2:16:15.400 --> 2:16:16.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:16:16.400 --> 2:16:17.400\n I might have enough material to do standup.\n\n2:16:17.400 --> 2:16:21.240\n I've never thought about it, but I might have enough material.\n\n2:16:21.240 --> 2:16:25.480\n Um, I don't know, like 15 minutes or something.\n\n2:16:25.480 --> 2:16:26.480\n Oh yeah.\n\n2:16:26.480 --> 2:16:27.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:16:27.480 --> 2:16:28.480\n Do a Netflix special.\n\n2:16:28.480 --> 2:16:29.480\n Netflix special.\n\n2:16:29.480 --> 2:16:30.480\n Sure.\n\n2:16:30.480 --> 2:16:36.240\n Um, what's your favorite Rick and Morty concept, uh, just to spring that on you.\n\n2:16:36.240 --> 2:16:39.960\n Is there, there's a lot of sort of scientific engineering ideas explored there.\n\n2:16:39.960 --> 2:16:42.880\n There's the butter robot.\n\n2:16:42.880 --> 2:16:44.800\n That's a great, uh, that's a great show.\n\n2:16:44.800 --> 2:16:45.800\n Um, yeah.\n\n2:16:45.800 --> 2:16:47.440\n Rick and Morty is awesome.\n\n2:16:47.440 --> 2:16:50.560\n Somebody that's exactly like you from an alternate dimension showed up there.\n\n2:16:50.560 --> 2:16:51.560\n Elon Tusk.\n\n2:16:51.560 --> 2:16:52.560\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n2:16:52.560 --> 2:16:53.560\n That you voiced.\n\n2:16:53.560 --> 2:16:54.560\n Yeah.\n\n2:16:54.560 --> 2:16:57.200\n Rick and Morty certainly explores a lot of interesting concepts.\n\n2:16:57.200 --> 2:17:00.200\n Uh, so like what's the favorite one?\n\n2:17:00.200 --> 2:17:01.200\n I don't know.\n\n2:17:01.200 --> 2:17:04.960\n The butter robot certainly is, uh, you know, it's like, it's certainly possible to have\n\n2:17:04.960 --> 2:17:06.840\n too much sentience in a device.\n\n2:17:06.840 --> 2:17:12.080\n Um, like you don't want to have your toast to be like a super genius toaster.\n\n2:17:12.080 --> 2:17:15.280\n It's going to hate, hate life cause all it could do is make his toast.\n\n2:17:15.280 --> 2:17:19.720\n But if it's like, you don't want to have like super intelligent stuck in a very limited\n\n2:17:19.720 --> 2:17:20.720\n device.\n\n2:17:20.720 --> 2:17:24.960\n Um, do you think it's too easy from a, if we're talking about from the engineering perspective\n\n2:17:24.960 --> 2:17:30.760\n of super intelligence, like with Marvin the robot, like, is it, it seems like it might\n\n2:17:30.760 --> 2:17:33.800\n be very easy to engineer just the depressed robot.\n\n2:17:33.800 --> 2:17:40.760\n Like it's not obvious to engineer and robot that's going to find a fulfilling existence.\n\n2:17:40.760 --> 2:17:47.160\n Sometimes humans I suppose, but, um, I wonder if that's like the default, if you don't do\n\n2:17:47.160 --> 2:17:52.800\n a good job on building a robot, it's going to be sad a lot.\n\n2:17:52.800 --> 2:17:58.160\n Well we can reprogram robots easier than we can reprogram humans.\n\n2:17:58.160 --> 2:18:06.520\n So I guess if you let it evolve without tinkering, then it might get a sad, uh, but you can change\n\n2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:13.000\n the optimization function and have it be a cheery robot.\n\n2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:17.560\n You uh, like I mentioned with, with SpaceX, you give a lot of people hope and a lot of\n\n2:18:17.560 --> 2:18:18.560\n people look up to you.\n\n2:18:18.560 --> 2:18:19.920\n Millions of people look up to you.\n\n2:18:19.920 --> 2:18:26.400\n Uh, if we think about young people in high school, maybe in college, um, what advice\n\n2:18:26.400 --> 2:18:31.680\n would you give to them about if they want to try to do something big in this world,\n\n2:18:31.680 --> 2:18:33.680\n they want to really have a big positive impact.\n\n2:18:33.680 --> 2:18:39.440\n What advice would you give them about their career, maybe about life in general?\n\n2:18:39.440 --> 2:18:40.440\n Try to be useful.\n\n2:18:40.440 --> 2:18:46.480\n Um, you know, do things that are useful to your fellow human beings, to the world.\n\n2:18:46.480 --> 2:18:48.480\n It's very hard to be useful.\n\n2:18:48.480 --> 2:18:51.680\n Um, very hard.\n\n2:18:51.680 --> 2:18:57.200\n Um, you know, are you contributing more than you consume?\n\n2:18:57.200 --> 2:19:05.760\n You know, like, uh, like can you try to have a positive net contribution to society?\n\n2:19:05.760 --> 2:19:11.600\n Um, I think that's the thing to aim for, you know, not, not to try to be sort of a leader\n\n2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:15.200\n for just for the sake of being a leader or whatever.\n\n2:19:15.200 --> 2:19:22.080\n Um, a lot of time people, a lot of times the people you want as leaders are the people\n\n2:19:22.080 --> 2:19:24.440\n who don't want to be leaders.\n\n2:19:24.440 --> 2:19:36.640\n So, um, if you live a useful life, that is a good life, a life worth having lived.\n\n2:19:36.640 --> 2:19:45.040\n Um, you know, and I, like I said, I would, I would encourage people to use the mental\n\n2:19:45.040 --> 2:19:48.360\n tools of physics and apply them broadly in life.\n\n2:19:48.360 --> 2:19:49.360\n There are the best tools.\n\n2:19:49.360 --> 2:19:54.040\n When you think about education and self education, what do you recommend?\n\n2:19:54.040 --> 2:20:01.920\n So there's the university, there's a self study, there is a hands on sort of finding\n\n2:20:01.920 --> 2:20:05.840\n a company or a place or a set of people that do the thing you're passionate about and joining\n\n2:20:05.840 --> 2:20:08.080\n them as early as possible.\n\n2:20:08.080 --> 2:20:13.520\n Um, there's, uh, taking a road trip across Europe for a few years and writing some poetry,\n\n2:20:13.520 --> 2:20:18.440\n which, uh, which, which trajectory do you suggest?\n\n2:20:18.440 --> 2:20:24.000\n In terms of learning about how you can become useful, as you mentioned, how you can have\n\n2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:27.320\n the most positive impact.\n\n2:20:27.320 --> 2:20:39.160\n Well, I encourage people to read a lot of books, just read, basically try to ingest\n\n2:20:39.160 --> 2:20:46.000\n as much information as you can, uh, and try to also just develop a good general knowledge.\n\n2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:54.320\n Um, so, so you at least have like a rough lay of the land of the knowledge landscape.\n\n2:20:54.320 --> 2:20:59.040\n Like try to learn a little bit about a lot of things, um, cause you might not know what\n\n2:20:59.040 --> 2:21:00.040\n you're really interested in.\n\n2:21:00.040 --> 2:21:04.280\n How would you know what you're really interested in if you at least aren't like doing a peripheral\n\n2:21:04.280 --> 2:21:10.240\n explore exploration of broadly of, of the knowledge landscape?\n\n2:21:10.240 --> 2:21:17.320\n Um, and you talk to people from different walks of life and different, uh, industries\n\n2:21:17.320 --> 2:21:27.520\n and professions and skills and occupations, like just try to learn as much as possible.\n\n2:21:27.520 --> 2:21:31.120\n Man's search for meaning.\n\n2:21:31.120 --> 2:21:32.920\n Isn't the whole thing a search for meaning?\n\n2:21:32.920 --> 2:21:33.920\n Yeah.\n\n2:21:33.920 --> 2:21:38.920\n What's the meaning of life and all, you know, but just generally, like I said, I would encourage\n\n2:21:38.920 --> 2:21:45.760\n people to read broadly, um, in many different subject areas, um, and, and, and then try\n\n2:21:45.760 --> 2:21:51.580\n to find something where there's an overlap of your talents and, and what you're interested\n\n2:21:51.580 --> 2:21:52.580\n in.\n\n2:21:52.580 --> 2:21:56.120\n So people may, may, may be good at something, but, or they may have skill at a particular\n\n2:21:56.120 --> 2:21:57.760\n thing, but they don't like doing it.\n\n2:21:57.760 --> 2:22:04.680\n Um, so you want to try to find a thing where you have your, that's a good, a good, a combination\n\n2:22:04.680 --> 2:22:12.600\n of, of your, of the things that you're inherently good at, but you also like doing, um, and,\n\n2:22:12.600 --> 2:22:13.600\n um,\n\n2:22:13.600 --> 2:22:18.680\n And reading is a super fast shortcut to, to figure out which, where are you, you both\n\n2:22:18.680 --> 2:22:19.680\n good at it.\n\n2:22:19.680 --> 2:22:22.680\n You like doing it and it will actually have positive impact.\n\n2:22:22.680 --> 2:22:25.040\n Well, you got to learn about things somehow.\n\n2:22:25.040 --> 2:22:31.320\n So read, reading a broad range, just really read, read it.\n\n2:22:31.320 --> 2:22:38.760\n You know, one point was that kid I read through the encyclopedia, uh, so that was pretty helpful.\n\n2:22:38.760 --> 2:22:44.280\n Um, and, uh, there are also things that I didn't even know existed a lot, so obviously\n\n2:22:44.280 --> 2:22:45.280\n and\n\n2:22:45.280 --> 2:22:46.280\n It's like as broad as it gets.\n\n2:22:46.280 --> 2:22:51.240\n Encyclopedias were digestible, I think, uh, you know, whatever, 40 years ago.\n\n2:22:51.240 --> 2:22:58.360\n Um, so, um, you know, maybe read through the, the condensed version of the encyclopedia\n\n2:22:58.360 --> 2:22:59.360\n of Britannica.\n\n2:22:59.360 --> 2:23:05.120\n And that, um, you can always like skip subjects or you read a few paragraphs and you know\n\n2:23:05.120 --> 2:23:07.560\n you're not interested, just jump to the next one.\n\n2:23:07.560 --> 2:23:12.360\n That sort of read the encyclopedia or scan, skim, skim through it.\n\n2:23:12.360 --> 2:23:19.920\n Um, and, um, but I, you know, I put a lot of stock and certainly have a lot of respect\n\n2:23:19.920 --> 2:23:27.480\n for someone who puts in an honest day's work, uh, to do useful things and, and just generally\n\n2:23:27.480 --> 2:23:34.560\n to have like a, not a zero sum mindset, um, or, uh, like have, have more of a grow the\n\n2:23:34.560 --> 2:23:35.840\n pie mindset.\n\n2:23:35.840 --> 2:23:42.280\n Like the, if you, if you sort of say like when, when I see people like perhaps, um,\n\n2:23:42.280 --> 2:23:48.320\n including some very smart people kind of taking an attitude of, uh, like, like, like doing\n\n2:23:48.320 --> 2:23:53.640\n things that seem like morally questionable, it's often because they have at a base sort\n\n2:23:53.640 --> 2:23:57.480\n of axiomatic level, a zero sum mindset.\n\n2:23:57.480 --> 2:24:02.720\n Um, and, and they, without realizing it, they don't realize they have a zero sum mindset\n\n2:24:02.720 --> 2:24:04.920\n or at least that they don't realize it consciously.\n\n2:24:04.920 --> 2:24:09.260\n Um, and so if you have a zero sum mindset, then the only way to get ahead is by taking\n\n2:24:09.260 --> 2:24:11.520\n things from others.\n\n2:24:11.520 --> 2:24:17.160\n If it's like, if the, if the, if the pie is fixed, then the only way to have more pie\n\n2:24:17.160 --> 2:24:19.360\n is to take someone else's pie.\n\n2:24:19.360 --> 2:24:20.680\n But this is false.\n\n2:24:20.680 --> 2:24:24.120\n Like obviously the pie has grown dramatically over time, the economic pie.\n\n2:24:24.120 --> 2:24:31.640\n Um, so the reality, in reality you can have the, so overuse this analogy, if you have\n\n2:24:31.640 --> 2:24:37.960\n a lot of, there's a lot of pie, pie is not fixed.\n\n2:24:37.960 --> 2:24:43.640\n Um, uh, so you really want to make sure you don't, you're not operating, um, without realizing\n\n2:24:43.640 --> 2:24:47.960\n it from a zero sum mindset where, where the only way to get ahead is to take things from\n\n2:24:47.960 --> 2:24:48.960\n others.\n\n2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:52.040\n And you take, try to take things from others, which is not, not good.\n\n2:24:52.040 --> 2:25:02.280\n It's much better to work on, uh, adding to the economic pie, maybe, you know, so creating,\n\n2:25:02.280 --> 2:25:06.200\n like I said, create, creating more than you consume, uh, doing more than you.\n\n2:25:06.200 --> 2:25:07.200\n Yeah.\n\n2:25:07.200 --> 2:25:08.960\n Um, so that's, that's a big deal.\n\n2:25:08.960 --> 2:25:15.040\n Um, I think there's like, you know, a fair number of people in, in finance that, uh,\n\n2:25:15.040 --> 2:25:16.680\n do have a bit of a zero sum mindset.\n\n2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:19.160\n I mean, it's all walks of life.\n\n2:25:19.160 --> 2:25:25.680\n I've seen that one of the, one of the reasons, uh, Rogan inspires me is he celebrates others\n\n2:25:25.680 --> 2:25:26.680\n a lot.\n\n2:25:26.680 --> 2:25:29.400\n There's not, not creating a constant competition.\n\n2:25:29.400 --> 2:25:31.400\n Like there's a scarcity of resources.\n\n2:25:31.400 --> 2:25:36.800\n What happens when you celebrate others and you promote others, the ideas of others, it,\n\n2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:38.960\n it, uh, it actually grows that pie.\n\n2:25:38.960 --> 2:25:45.280\n I mean, it, every, like the, uh, the resource, the resources become less scarce and that,\n\n2:25:45.280 --> 2:25:46.760\n that applies in a lot of kinds of domains.\n\n2:25:46.760 --> 2:25:51.600\n It applies in academia where a lot of people are very, uh, see some funding for academic\n\n2:25:51.600 --> 2:25:54.120\n research is zero sum and it is not.\n\n2:25:54.120 --> 2:25:58.080\n If you celebrate each other, if you make, if you get everybody to be excited about AI,\n\n2:25:58.080 --> 2:26:02.440\n about physics, above mathematics, I think it, there'll be more and more funding and\n\n2:26:02.440 --> 2:26:03.640\n I think everybody wins.\n\n2:26:03.640 --> 2:26:04.640\n Yeah.\n\n2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:05.640\n That applies, I think broadly.\n\n2:26:05.640 --> 2:26:06.640\n Uh,\n\n2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:08.680\n yeah, yeah, exactly.\n\n2:26:08.680 --> 2:26:15.240\n So last, last question about love and meaning, uh, what is the role of love?\n\n2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:21.720\n In the human condition, broadly and more specific to you, how has love, romantic love or otherwise\n\n2:26:21.720 --> 2:26:27.360\n made you a better person, a better human being?\n\n2:26:27.360 --> 2:26:28.360\n Better engineer?\n\n2:26:28.360 --> 2:26:31.520\n Now you're asking really perplexing questions.\n\n2:26:31.520 --> 2:26:41.240\n Um, it's hard to give a, I mean, there are many books, poems and songs written about\n\n2:26:41.240 --> 2:26:50.960\n what is love and what is, what exactly, you know, um, you know, what is love, baby don't\n\n2:26:50.960 --> 2:26:51.960\n hurt me.\n\n2:26:51.960 --> 2:26:53.920\n Um, that's one of the great ones.\n\n2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:54.920\n Yes.\n\n2:26:54.920 --> 2:26:55.920\n Yeah.\n\n2:26:55.920 --> 2:26:58.120\n You've, you've earlier quoted Shakespeare, but that that's really up there.\n\n2:26:58.120 --> 2:26:59.120\n Yeah.\n\n2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:02.120\n Love is a many splinter thing.\n\n2:27:02.120 --> 2:27:07.960\n Uh, I mean there's, um, it's cause we've talked about so many inspiring things like be useful\n\n2:27:07.960 --> 2:27:13.720\n in the world, sort of like solve problems, alleviate suffering, but it seems like connection\n\n2:27:13.720 --> 2:27:20.320\n between humans is a source, you know, it's a, it's a source of joys, a source of meaning\n\n2:27:20.320 --> 2:27:24.160\n and that, that's what love is, friendship, love.\n\n2:27:24.160 --> 2:27:29.040\n I just wonder if you think about that kind of thing where you talk about preserving the\n\n2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:35.240\n light of human consciousness and us becoming a multi planetary, multi planetary species.\n\n2:27:35.240 --> 2:27:43.240\n I mean, to me at least, um, that, that means like if we're just alone and conscious and\n\n2:27:43.240 --> 2:27:48.880\n intelligent and it doesn't mean nearly as much as if we're with others, right?\n\n2:27:48.880 --> 2:27:54.560\n And there's some magic created when we're together, the, uh, the, the friendship of\n\n2:27:54.560 --> 2:27:55.560\n it.\n\n2:27:55.560 --> 2:27:59.440\n And I think the highest form of it is love, which I think broadly is, is much bigger than\n\n2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:05.800\n just sort of romantic, but also yes, romantic love and, um, family and those kinds of things.\n\n2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:10.420\n Well, I mean, the reason I guess I care about us becoming multi planet species in a space\n\n2:28:10.420 --> 2:28:19.600\n frank civilization is foundationally, I love humanity, um, and, and so I wish to see it\n\n2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:27.520\n prosper and do great things and be happy and, um, and if I did not love humanity, I would\n\n2:28:27.520 --> 2:28:29.640\n not care about these things.\n\n2:28:29.640 --> 2:28:35.080\n So when you look at the whole of it, the human history, all the people who's ever lived,\n\n2:28:35.080 --> 2:28:41.840\n all the people live now, it's pretty, we're, we're okay.\n\n2:28:41.840 --> 2:28:44.960\n On the whole, we're pretty interesting bunch.\n\n2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:45.960\n Yeah.\n\n2:28:45.960 --> 2:28:51.680\n All things considered, and I've read a lot of history, including the darkest, worst parts\n\n2:28:51.680 --> 2:28:59.560\n of it, and, uh, despite all that, I think on balance, I still love humanity.\n\n2:28:59.560 --> 2:29:03.280\n You joked about it with the 42, uh, what do you, what do you think is the meaning of this\n\n2:29:03.280 --> 2:29:05.600\n whole thing?\n\n2:29:05.600 --> 2:29:08.520\n Is like, is there a non numerical representation?\n\n2:29:08.520 --> 2:29:09.520\n Yeah.\n\n2:29:09.520 --> 2:29:13.120\n Well, really, I think what Douglas Adams was saying in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\n2:29:13.120 --> 2:29:22.000\n is that, um, the universe is the answer and, uh, what we really need to figure out are\n\n2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:27.680\n what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe and that the question is the\n\n2:29:27.680 --> 2:29:28.680\n really the hard part.\n\n2:29:28.680 --> 2:29:33.640\n And if you can properly frame the question, then the answer, relatively speaking, is easy.\n\n2:29:33.640 --> 2:29:40.840\n Uh, so, so, so therefore, if you want to understand what questions to ask about the universe,\n\n2:29:40.840 --> 2:29:45.860\n you want to understand the meaning of life, we need to expand the scope and scale of consciousness\n\n2:29:45.860 --> 2:29:51.120\n so that we're better able to understand the nature of the universe and, and understand\n\n2:29:51.120 --> 2:29:52.580\n the meaning of life.\n\n2:29:52.580 --> 2:30:00.240\n And ultimately, the most important part would be to ask the right question, thereby elevating\n\n2:30:00.240 --> 2:30:07.880\n the role of the interviewer as the most important human in the room.\n\n2:30:07.880 --> 2:30:12.880\n Good questions are, you know, it's a hard, it's hard to come up with good questions.\n\n2:30:12.880 --> 2:30:13.880\n Absolutely.\n\n2:30:13.880 --> 2:30:20.000\n Um, but yeah, like, it's like that, that is the foundation of my philosophy is that, um,\n\n2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:27.240\n I am curious about the nature of the universe and, uh, you know, and obviously I will die.\n\n2:30:27.240 --> 2:30:31.840\n I don't know when I'll die, but I won't live forever.\n\n2:30:31.840 --> 2:30:36.560\n Um, but I would like to know that we are on a path to understanding the nature of the\n\n2:30:36.560 --> 2:30:40.040\n universe and the meaning of life and what questions to ask about the answer that is\n\n2:30:40.040 --> 2:30:41.040\n the universe.\n\n2:30:41.040 --> 2:30:46.160\n And, um, and so if we expand the scope and scale of humanity and consciousness in general,\n\n2:30:46.160 --> 2:30:51.960\n um, which includes silicon consciousness, then that, you know, that, that, that seems\n\n2:30:51.960 --> 2:30:53.920\n like a fundamentally good thing.\n\n2:30:53.920 --> 2:31:00.520\n Elon, like I said, um, I'm deeply grateful that you would spend your extremely valuable\n\n2:31:00.520 --> 2:31:07.040\n time with me today and also that you have given millions of people hope in this difficult\n\n2:31:07.040 --> 2:31:11.380\n time, this divisive time, in this, uh, cynical time.\n\n2:31:11.380 --> 2:31:14.160\n So I hope you do continue doing what you're doing.\n\n2:31:14.160 --> 2:31:15.160\n Thank you so much for talking today.\n\n2:31:15.160 --> 2:31:16.160\n Oh, you're welcome.\n\n2:31:16.160 --> 2:31:18.880\n Uh, thanks for your excellent questions.\n\n2:31:18.880 --> 2:31:21.280\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Elon Musk.\n\n2:31:21.280 --> 2:31:25.480\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:31:25.480 --> 2:31:29.640\n And now let me leave you with some words from Elon Musk himself.\n\n2:31:29.640 --> 2:31:35.840\n When something is important enough, you do it, even if the odds are not in your favor.\n\n2:31:35.840 --> 2:32:02.560\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
