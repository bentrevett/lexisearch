To support this podcast,\n\n00:16.400 --> 00:24.720\n please check out our sponsors, Insight Tracker, GiveWell, NI, Indeed, and Masterclass. Their links\n\n00:24.720 --> 00:31.280\n are in the description. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here's my conversation with Brian\n\n00:31.280 --> 00:39.760\n Miorescu. Who or what do you think God is? How has our conception, maybe put another way,\n\n00:39.760 --> 00:43.680\n of God changed throughout history? We're starting with an easy one, Lex.\n\n00:43.680 --> 00:55.120\n Yep. So, what is God? Well, God is a thought. God is an idea, but its reference is to that which is\n\n00:55.120 --> 01:02.320\n beyond thinking, beyond our ability to even conceive, beyond the categories of being and\n\n01:02.320 --> 01:07.760\n nonbeing. So, how do we talk about that? To talk about it is almost to get it wrong, right? So,\n\n01:07.760 --> 01:14.160\n Joe Campbell famously said that any God that is not transparent to transcendence is like an\n\n01:14.160 --> 01:20.320\n idolatry because it's just a mental construct, and it can't possibly speak to the incomprehensible.\n\n01:20.320 --> 01:28.080\n So, we use poetic language. We say the being of beings, the infinite life energy of the universe,\n\n01:28.640 --> 01:35.040\n the mystery of transcendence, boundless life, unqualified isness, but it doesn't quite get to\n\n01:35.040 --> 01:41.520\n the point. I think that if there's any great insight from mysticism, it's that you and I\n\n01:41.520 --> 01:48.240\n participate with God in a very real way, Lex Friedman, here in Austin, Texas, that in the here\n\n01:48.240 --> 01:54.160\n and now to touch that eternal principle, another way to refer to God, to touch that eternal principle\n\n01:54.160 --> 02:02.240\n within ourselves is to participate with divinity in some way. So, not an external force, but\n\n02:02.240 --> 02:07.440\n that divine sense within. So, there's some aspect in which God is a part of us. So, one, it's the\n\n02:07.440 --> 02:13.600\n thing we can't describe. It represents all of the mystery around us. It's outside our ability to\n\n02:13.600 --> 02:19.200\n comprehend, and at the same time, it's somehow the thing that's inside of us also. The ultimate\n\n02:19.200 --> 02:24.400\n paradox. Mechthild of Magdeburg, 13th century German mystic, maybe the first German mystic,\n\n02:25.840 --> 02:32.160\n says that the day of her spiritual awakening was the day that she saw and knew that she saw God\n\n02:32.160 --> 02:37.920\n in all things and all things in God. And so, we can say this, by the way, without apology or\n\n02:37.920 --> 02:45.120\n lightweight theology or vapid speculation or even heresy. We can talk about this,\n\n02:45.120 --> 02:49.520\n including within the Abrahamic faiths. The mystical core of these faiths all talk about\n\n02:49.520 --> 02:56.160\n the encounter of divinity within. That's what I explore in the immortality key, this notion of\n\n02:56.160 --> 03:02.240\n techniques, archaic techniques in some cases, of ecstasy, that allow that experience of the\n\n03:02.240 --> 03:07.200\n eternal principle to actually rise up in our consciousness when we're still here as flesh and\n\n03:07.200 --> 03:15.680\n blood beings. There's some sense in which our conception of God, though, is conjured up by\n\n03:15.680 --> 03:26.240\n our own mind. And so, aren't we creating God? Aren't we the gods that are creating the idea of\n\n03:26.240 --> 03:36.320\n God? When we talk about God, aren't we playing with ideas that are created by our mind and\n\n03:36.320 --> 03:46.320\n thereby we are the creator, not God? This is a very kind of cyclical question, but in some sense,\n\n03:46.320 --> 03:55.840\n I mean that if God is the thing that represents the mystery all around us, contrast that with\n\n03:55.840 --> 04:01.520\n our conception of God, the way we talk about him, is more a creation of our minds. It's not the\n\n04:01.520 --> 04:07.280\n mystery. It's our struggle to comprehend the mystery. And therefore, we're creating the God\n\n04:07.280 --> 04:12.720\n in terms of the God that we're talking about in this conversation or in general, if that makes any\n\n04:12.720 --> 04:20.320\n sense. It makes no sense whatsoever. Great. This is wonderful. But this is the eternal mystery.\n\n04:21.840 --> 04:27.120\n This is why it's so difficult to talk about, and yet it could be the very center of our beings.\n\n04:27.120 --> 04:33.120\n The Upanishads speak about us as the creators, about us as gods. It's a very different creation\n\n04:33.120 --> 04:41.200\n myth, but the God of the Upanishads in this great verse talks about pouring themselves into\n\n04:41.200 --> 04:48.160\n creation. Indeed, I have become this creation, says God. And there's a great line, verily he or\n\n04:48.160 --> 04:56.640\n she who knows this becomes in this creation a creator. So, yeah, I mean, just our ability to\n\n04:56.640 --> 05:02.480\n engage in mentation, our ability to think about this stuff is partly our divine nature. This is\n\n05:02.480 --> 05:07.840\n what the humanists were talking about in the Renaissance, by the way. And that it's not so much\n\n05:08.560 --> 05:15.680\n learning, putting dots together, having arguments with each other over learned books. It's a\n\n05:15.680 --> 05:21.680\n process of unlearning, is what some of the mystical traditions talk about. Unlearning all these\n\n05:21.680 --> 05:27.040\n thoughts, emotions, traumas, and experiences that have gone into the false construction of our false\n\n05:27.040 --> 05:34.720\n self, that behind all these layers, like peeling back the onion, is a part of us that once you can\n\n05:34.720 --> 05:40.160\n identify that, begins to look a little bit different. In other words, it's one thing to\n\n05:40.160 --> 05:47.360\n foster a relationship with God. It's a very different thing to identify as God. And I mean\n\n05:47.360 --> 05:52.240\n that quite literally, without being heretical. You can find this in the mystery traditions.\n\n05:52.960 --> 05:58.320\n Can you expand on this? You mean a human being can embody God?\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:07.040\n That is textbook incarnational theology that you can find in any Christian mysticism.\n\n06:07.040 --> 06:13.840\n But you can find it in the mystical tradition of Islam and Judaism as well. So, Rumi, for example,\n\n06:14.800 --> 06:22.000\n the great Sufi mystic talks about, if you could get rid of yourself, just get rid of yourself just\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:28.240\n once, the secret of secrets would open to you. That the face of the unknown would appear on the\n\n06:28.240 --> 06:33.520\n perception of your consciousness. Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, a modern day Christian,\n\n06:33.520 --> 06:38.240\n of your consciousness. Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, a modern day contemporary mystic,\n\n06:38.880 --> 06:42.080\n talks about, because this stuff does continue, there's a continuity to it.\n\n06:42.080 --> 06:44.080\n The poetry here is incredible.\n\n06:44.080 --> 06:49.200\n So, well, listen to Rabbi Kushner. He says that the emptying of selfhood\n\n06:50.080 --> 06:56.480\n allows the soul to attach to true reality. And in Kabbalism, the true reality is what's called\n\n06:56.480 --> 07:03.680\n the divine nothingness, ayin. And so, I like the adage that atheists and mystics both essentially\n\n07:03.680 --> 07:10.240\n believe in nothing, except that the mystics spell it with a capital N, the divine nothing.\n\n07:10.240 --> 07:15.760\n And then I'll give you Meister Eckhart, another medieval Christian mystic. He says that\n\n07:16.800 --> 07:22.400\n if you could not yourself, the same concept, if you could not yourself for just an instant,\n\n07:22.400 --> 07:27.440\n indeed, I say less than an instant, you would possess all. So, again, you're seeing the same\n\n07:27.440 --> 07:33.600\n thing in Sufism, Kabbalism, Christian mysticism. The way to identify with the divine is to peel\n\n07:33.600 --> 07:37.440\n back these layers and attempt to discover pure awareness.\n\n07:38.080 --> 07:41.920\n If we look at the universe from a physics perspective, or, you know, I'm a computer\n\n07:41.920 --> 07:53.280\n science person, so if the universe is a computer, there's some sense that God, the creator of the\n\n07:53.280 --> 07:58.960\n universe, or just the computer itself, doesn't know what the heck is going to happen. He just\n\n07:58.960 --> 08:05.680\n kind of creates some basic rules and runs the thing. So, there is some element in which you\n\n08:05.680 --> 08:13.600\n can conceive of humans or conscious beings or intelligent beings as a tool that the creator\n\n08:13.600 --> 08:24.240\n uses to understand himself. Do you think that's a perspective that we could or is useful to take on\n\n08:24.240 --> 08:33.040\n God that is basically the universe created humans to understand itself? He doesn't actually know\n\n08:33.040 --> 08:39.200\n the full thing. He needs the human brains to figure out the puzzle. So, that's in contrasting\n\n08:39.200 --> 08:43.840\n to the unlearning to getting out of the way that we've talked about. It's more like, no,\n\n08:43.840 --> 08:48.880\n we need the humans to figure out this puzzle. Well, we have no answers to this, which is why\n\n08:48.880 --> 08:53.840\n philosophers still have jobs, if they have jobs at all. But, I mean, so the physicists take a look\n\n08:53.840 --> 08:58.480\n at this. Have you seen the article that came out, I think it was this month, in the Journal of\n\n08:58.480 --> 09:04.960\n Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, Robert Lanza, the biocentrism theory, the idea that the universe\n\n09:04.960 --> 09:10.080\n comes into being through our observation, right, the whole, the God equation. So, not just in\n\n09:10.080 --> 09:15.680\n quantum mechanics, but in general relativity, the idea that we make the universe moment by moment,\n\n09:15.680 --> 09:21.600\n which is kind of mind blowing, gets into ideas of simulation. Okay, so that's how the physicists,\n\n09:21.600 --> 09:26.080\n at least some of them might look at it. You could also look back to the medieval Christian mystics,\n\n09:26.080 --> 09:34.400\n Meister Eckhart, once again, says that the eye with which I see God is the same eye that sees me,\n\n09:34.400 --> 09:42.320\n right? So, one sight, one knowledge, one love, another mind blowing concept. But this is why\n\n09:42.320 --> 09:46.640\n the arts and poetry and music are so important, because although I love astroparticle physics,\n\n09:47.280 --> 09:51.840\n it's another to kind of hear this, the same message across time.\n\n09:51.840 --> 09:58.720\n Yeah, the simulation thing. I was actually looking this morning at video games, just the statistics\n\n09:58.720 --> 10:05.920\n on video games. And I saw that the two top video games in terms of hours played is Fortnite and\n\n10:05.920 --> 10:13.600\n World of Warcraft. And I saw that it's 140 billion hours, billion hours have been played of those\n\n10:13.600 --> 10:22.320\n games. That's a lot of video games. Yeah, but that's very sophisticated worlds being created,\n\n10:22.320 --> 10:27.360\n especially in the World of Warcraft. It's a massive online role playing game. So you have\n\n10:27.360 --> 10:33.120\n these characters that are together sort of creating a world, but they in themselves are also\n\n10:33.120 --> 10:37.280\n developing, they have all these items, and they're like, they're little humans. Like there's\n\n10:37.280 --> 10:41.760\n complicated societies that are formed, they have goals, they're striving and so on. And it's,\n\n10:41.760 --> 10:48.640\n we're creating a universe within our universe. And for now, it's a kind of, it's a basic sort\n\n10:48.640 --> 10:55.200\n of constraint version of our more richer earth like civilization. But it's conceivable that,\n\n10:55.760 --> 11:02.080\n you know, that we are this thing on earth is a kind of video game that somebody else is playing.\n\n11:02.080 --> 11:05.600\n It's like you can see sort of video games upon video games being created.\n\n11:05.600 --> 11:12.080\n That, and this is something I think a lot about, not from philosophical perspective, but practically,\n\n11:12.080 --> 11:19.920\n how fun does this video game have to be for us to let go of the silly pursuits in this meat space\n\n11:19.920 --> 11:27.280\n that we live in and fully just stay in wow, stay in World of Warcraft, stay in the video game for\n\n11:27.280 --> 11:32.160\n full time. So I think about that from an engineering perspective. Like is there going to be a time\n\n11:32.160 --> 11:39.440\n when this video game is actual real life for us, and then the creatures inside the video game,\n\n11:40.160 --> 11:46.800\n they'll be just borrowing our consciousness, sort of to ground themselves will refer to us as the\n\n11:46.800 --> 11:55.440\n gods. Right? Like, won't we become the gods? This conversation is not going how I expected.\n\n11:55.440 --> 12:00.720\n But I think about this a lot from, you know, because I love video games, and I wonder more\n\n12:00.720 --> 12:06.000\n and more of us, especially in COVID times, are living in the digital world. You could think about\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:10.560\n Twitter and all those kinds of things. You could think about clubhouse people using just voices to\n\n12:10.560 --> 12:15.200\n communicate with little icons, sort of in the digital space, you could see more and more will\n\n12:15.200 --> 12:23.280\n be moving in the digital space and let go of this physical space. And then the remnants of the\n\n12:23.280 --> 12:29.200\n ancients that created the video games, that nobody centuries from now will even remember,\n\n12:29.200 --> 12:34.560\n those will be the gods. And then there'll be gods upon gods being created. This is the kind of stuff\n\n12:34.560 --> 12:40.880\n I think about. But is that any at all useful to you to this thought experiment of a simulation?\n\n12:40.880 --> 12:46.000\n Basically, the fabric of our reality, how did it come to be? What is running this thing? Is that\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:52.880\n useful? Or is it ultimately the project of understanding God, of understanding myth,\n\n12:52.880 --> 12:58.800\n is the project that centers on the human, on the human mind, for you?\n\n12:58.800 --> 13:04.880\n Hmm. We seem to be at the center of this divine dance, which sounds awfully anthropocentric.\n\n13:05.440 --> 13:11.680\n But the ancients thought about this too. I mean, the concept in Sanskrit of lila, that the point\n\n13:11.680 --> 13:17.680\n behind existence is this play, right? It's ultimately playful, this divine dance. It gets\n\n13:17.680 --> 13:25.280\n awfully complicated in the Gnostic and Neoplatonic schools, these chains of being from God head down\n\n13:25.280 --> 13:31.920\n to us, right? Some invisible, right? And we're gonna get into Terence McKenna territory later\n\n13:31.920 --> 13:37.200\n on, but we can start now by talking about discarnate entities and archons and aliens\n\n13:37.200 --> 13:43.040\n and archetypes. I mean, there is a world where Terence McKenna does meet Plato and Gnosticism\n\n13:43.040 --> 13:51.840\n quite kindly, and that's in this invisible college, right? The invisible world with which we seem to\n\n13:51.840 --> 13:58.480\n have some kind of symbiosis that has a higher intent, maybe even a purpose or a plan in mind\n\n13:58.480 --> 14:02.960\n for us. So, I mean, these ideas come across when you've had a heroic dose of mushrooms.\n\n14:03.680 --> 14:08.000\n They also pop up in the ancient philosophical literature, this idea of archons who, you know,\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:16.080\n the puppet masters controlling us flesh and blood beings. It's all a cosmic dance, and there are no\n\n14:16.080 --> 14:20.480\n answers to this. First, who are the archons? And second, what is this world where Terence McKenna\n\n14:20.480 --> 14:25.600\n meets Plato? Do you mean in the space of ideas, or are we talking about some kind of world that\n\n14:25.600 --> 14:29.760\n connects all of consciousness throughout human history? I think through different techniques,\n\n14:29.760 --> 14:33.600\n it is, you know, I think a lot about, I think Gordon Wasson is the meeting point of the two.\n\n14:33.600 --> 14:39.920\n So, Gordon Wasson, who I do talk about in the book, was this J.P. Morgan banker turned\n\n14:39.920 --> 14:46.640\n ethnomycologist, and he's largely credited with the rediscovery of psilocybin containing mushrooms,\n\n14:46.640 --> 14:52.720\n which kind of gave rise to the pop psychedelic revolution of the 1960s. He visited Maria Sabina\n\n14:52.720 --> 14:57.440\n down in Mexico. In his wake went Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, the Stones, and everybody else.\n\n14:58.400 --> 15:03.280\n And the way he describes his psilocybin experience is a bit strange because he thinks of\n\n15:03.280 --> 15:09.840\n Plato, right? And he says that, you know, whereas our ordinary reality is kind of this imperfect\n\n15:09.840 --> 15:15.440\n view of things, Gordon Wasson felt that on mushrooms, he was spying the archetypes.\n\n15:15.440 --> 15:19.680\n And he talks about Plato, and he writes about the archetypes in this famous article that's\n\n15:19.680 --> 15:26.880\n released in 1957 in Life magazine. And so, a well read individual from the mid 20th century has his\n\n15:26.880 --> 15:33.760\n his premier psychedelic experience, and out comes Plato because what he was witnessing was so sharp,\n\n15:33.760 --> 15:40.000\n so brilliant, so detailed, in some sense, more real than real, this noetic sense that William\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:45.360\n James talks about, that when you confront something more real than real, these discarnate\n\n15:45.360 --> 15:52.480\n entities, these images, these visionary motifs, you're tempted to believe that you've tapped into\n\n15:52.480 --> 15:57.920\n the truest nature and the underlying structure of the cosmos. And that's difficult to escape from,\n\n15:57.920 --> 16:01.440\n whether you're Plato or Terence McKenna or Gordon Wasson caught in between.\n\n16:02.160 --> 16:06.720\n Can we talk about this being in touch with something that is more real than real?\n\n16:07.440 --> 16:11.520\n And let's just go straight there to McKenna before we return to the bigger picture.\n\n16:11.520 --> 16:16.080\n So he's talked about the, what is it, self healing machine elves?\n\n16:16.080 --> 16:17.120\n Self transforming.\n\n16:17.120 --> 16:25.200\n Self transforming machine elves during his DMT travels. And I just talked to Rick Doblin,\n\n16:25.200 --> 16:32.800\n who also had different travels to this hyperspace. But they all seem to be traveling on the same\n\n16:32.800 --> 16:37.440\n spaceship, just the different locations. And there is a sense in which they seem to be traveling\n\n16:38.640 --> 16:42.640\n through whatever, I don't know if it's through space time or something else,\n\n16:42.640 --> 16:48.640\n to meet something that is more real than real. What can you say about this DMT experience,\n\n16:48.640 --> 16:54.080\n about Terence McKenna, about the poetry he used, but maybe more specifically about\n\n16:54.080 --> 16:56.400\n this place that they seem to all travel to?\n\n16:57.120 --> 17:01.840\n So the big question is, is it real? Is it really more real than real? The ancient philosophers\n\n17:01.840 --> 17:06.960\n were asking the same question and their means of attempting to answer that was by dying.\n\n17:06.960 --> 17:12.640\n And so if you ask Plato the definition of philosophy, he will say that to practice it\n\n17:12.640 --> 17:19.520\n in the right way is to practice dying and being dead. And many people describe the psychedelic\n\n17:19.520 --> 17:25.280\n experience in sort of near death experience terms. And the encountering of all this visual\n\n17:25.280 --> 17:30.320\n imagery tends to be something that is often described as more real than real. So how does\n\n17:30.320 --> 17:35.680\n Terence talk about this? So I was just listening to the triologues, which folks should look up\n\n17:35.680 --> 17:42.400\n somewhere between 1989 and 1990. Terence sits down with his friends, Ralph Abraham and\n\n17:42.400 --> 17:48.080\n Rupert Sheldrake at Esalen. And they're trying to figure out the meaning of these\n\n17:48.080 --> 17:54.000\n discarnate entities and these nonhuman intelligences. And Terence develops a taxonomy\n\n17:54.000 --> 18:01.040\n for how to analyze this. And he says that number one, they're either semi physical,\n\n18:01.040 --> 18:07.280\n but kind of elusive. So think of the Bigfoot or the Yeti or things like this. Beings that exist\n\n18:07.280 --> 18:14.480\n somewhere between mythology and zoology, which isn't really appropriate here. So option number\n\n18:14.480 --> 18:21.600\n two, he says, is the mental. You're dropping so many good lines. It's so good. I apologize.\n\n18:23.600 --> 18:28.560\n Somewhere between mythology and zoology. This is all Terence McKenna. I take no credit for this.\n\n18:28.560 --> 18:34.320\n But you're combining, you're like, Jimi Hendrix only used the blues scale,\n\n18:34.320 --> 18:39.200\n but he still created something new in the music he played. Anyway, go ahead.\n\n18:39.200 --> 18:48.240\n We're going into Mixolydian right now. So option number two, and this is what Terence calls sort\n\n18:48.240 --> 18:55.360\n of the mentalist reductionist approach. And this is pure McKenna poetry. He says that these beings\n\n18:55.360 --> 19:02.640\n could be autonomous fragments of psychic energy that have temporarily escaped the controlling\n\n19:02.640 --> 19:09.360\n power of the ego. So in Jungian senses, these would just be pure projections, the projections\n\n19:09.360 --> 19:13.840\n of schizophrenics in some cases. So they're essentially unreal. And the third option,\n\n19:13.840 --> 19:19.440\n the most tantalizing, is that they're both nonphysical, but autonomous. In other words,\n\n19:19.440 --> 19:25.680\n they actually exist in some kind of real place, in some kind of real space, and that we can have\n\n19:25.680 --> 19:32.160\n Congress with them. There is communication. He talks about the whisperings of the demon artificers,\n\n19:32.160 --> 19:38.000\n and that it's just possible that our meetings with these beings have coaxed the human species\n\n19:38.560 --> 19:44.960\n into self expression in a very real way, that at different times in history, our relationships with\n\n19:44.960 --> 19:51.600\n these semi autonomous beings may actually guide the species. Now, this is high speculation,\n\n19:52.240 --> 19:59.520\n and Terence and Ralph and Rupert wind up talking about the early modern period and the scientific\n\n19:59.520 --> 20:04.960\n enlightenment, and that even someone like Descartes reports a dream in which he came face\n\n20:04.960 --> 20:11.840\n to face with an angel who said that the conquest of nature is to be achieved through measure and\n\n20:11.840 --> 20:19.120\n number. So even the hard minded materialist like Descartes is confronting these discarnate entities.\n\n20:19.120 --> 20:23.680\n John Dee in the 16th century, the high magician of the Elizabethan court,\n\n20:25.120 --> 20:30.480\n he reports decades worth of what we would say is extraterrestrial communication,\n\n20:30.480 --> 20:37.040\n or interdimensional communication. And you can find instances of this throughout history,\n\n20:37.040 --> 20:42.240\n including among the pre Socratics. And Peter Kingsley writes quite a bit about this, but I'll\n\n20:42.240 --> 20:47.520\n save that until your next question. Well, first of all, we don't seem to understand from where\n\n20:47.520 --> 20:53.360\n intelligence came from. We don't understand from where life came from on Earth. But that we can\n\n20:53.360 --> 20:57.360\n kind of intuit because it's the space of chemistry and biology have good theories about the origins\n\n20:57.360 --> 21:05.120\n of life on Earth. But the origins of intelligent life, that is a giant mystery. And there's some\n\n21:05.120 --> 21:11.680\n sense in which, I mean, I don't know if you know the movie 2001 Space Odyssey. But it does seem\n\n21:11.680 --> 21:17.120\n that there's like important throughout human history, throughout life on Earth, there's\n\n21:17.120 --> 21:26.080\n important phase shifts of it feels like something happened, where there's big leaps. It could be\n\n21:26.080 --> 21:31.120\n something coincidental, like fire and learning how to cook meat and all those kinds of things.\n\n21:31.120 --> 21:36.960\n But it feels like there could be other things. And I think that's at the core of your work is\n\n21:36.960 --> 21:44.960\n exploring what those things could be. Is there, is it possible? Talked about Joe Rogan off line.\n\n21:44.960 --> 21:52.800\n Is it entirely possible? Is it possible that psychedelics have in fact contributed of being\n\n21:52.800 --> 21:59.520\n an important source of those phase shift throughout human history of the intellect, basically steering\n\n21:59.520 --> 22:06.400\n the intellectual development and growth of human civilization. It's a hypothesis worth\n\n22:06.400 --> 22:11.280\n investigating. How about that? Beautiful. And maybe not psychedelics in and of themselves,\n\n22:11.280 --> 22:17.040\n but I think our whole conversation is kind of wrapped up in these non ordinary states of\n\n22:17.040 --> 22:23.680\n awareness. We start by talking about God, which is something unordinary and expansive. And I think\n\n22:23.680 --> 22:31.840\n that as you trace the intervention of divinity, if that's the case, throughout human history,\n\n22:31.840 --> 22:38.560\n you have to bump up against the irrational. And Mursi Eliade, the great scholar of religions and\n\n22:38.560 --> 22:44.320\n fellow Romanian said that the history of religions essentially constitutes the point of intersection\n\n22:44.320 --> 22:51.840\n between metaphysics and biology. So that we are biological beings who do interact with our planet,\n\n22:51.840 --> 22:57.840\n with the natural kingdom. And you would think that as, you know, early archaic ecologists,\n\n22:57.840 --> 23:04.240\n we would have figured out what plants work, which fungi don't and developed maybe language around\n\n23:04.240 --> 23:11.360\n that. And so this is another one of McKenna's speculative, but very interesting hypotheses,\n\n23:11.360 --> 23:17.920\n the stone and ape theory. Is it possible that psychedelics were involved in one of the several\n\n23:17.920 --> 23:23.760\n leaps forward? You mentioned the word leap. Jared Diamond talks about the great leap forward 60,000\n\n23:23.760 --> 23:28.560\n years ago. The species had been around for a couple hundred thousand years. All of a sudden,\n\n23:28.560 --> 23:34.000\n the cave painting appears. All of a sudden there's a phase shift. Did something like that happen\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:38.640\n millions of years ago? And I love the way Paul Stamets talks about this. It would be the ingestion\n\n23:39.280 --> 23:47.040\n of perhaps psilocybin containing fungi millions and millions of times over millions and millions\n\n23:47.040 --> 23:52.400\n of years. So it's not just a one time event that cascades, but it's the accumulation\n\n23:52.960 --> 23:59.920\n of psychedelic experience. It's really difficult to test that hypothesis. But I've been talking\n\n23:59.920 --> 24:06.160\n with a paleoanthropologist in South Africa, my friend Lee Berger, about ways that we might test\n\n24:06.160 --> 24:12.400\n for this. And so Lee, amongst many things, is this national geographic explorer. He's the\n\n24:12.400 --> 24:18.000\n paleoanthropologist's paleoanthropologist at the University of Witwatersrand. He's famous,\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:22.720\n amongst other things, for the discovery of previously undiscovered hominids like Homo\n\n24:22.720 --> 24:33.280\n naledi. And there's an interesting point. So naledi is this archaic hominid, morphologically\n\n24:33.280 --> 24:39.920\n archaic, but it dates to about 300,000 years ago, which is very strange. What's even more\n\n24:39.920 --> 24:44.800\n strange about Homo naledi at the Rising Star cave system there in South Africa is that Lee\n\n24:44.800 --> 24:50.640\n believes he's discovered the first bipedal ape deliberately disposing of its dead.\n\n24:51.680 --> 24:58.400\n So there is a recognition of self mortality and the practicing of rituals around death. We're\n\n24:58.400 --> 25:05.840\n talking about burials. And if you have burials, says Lee, in an archaic hominid 300,000 years ago,\n\n25:05.840 --> 25:10.320\n maybe you have language. And I mentioned that because Terence McKenna was obsessed\n\n25:10.320 --> 25:16.720\n with language in the stoned ape theory, that the ingestion of psilocybin in addition to enhancing\n\n25:16.720 --> 25:22.480\n visual acuity, perhaps facilitating sexual arousal, leads to proto language.\n\n25:23.280 --> 25:30.240\n Now, isn't it interesting, this could be entirely a coincidence, that the largest sound inventory\n\n25:30.240 --> 25:37.680\n of any language is the Khoisan of Botswana and Namibia. They have something like 164 consonants\n\n25:37.680 --> 25:43.280\n and 44 vowels. English, by comparison, has about 45. So I don't know what to make of this, but what\n\n25:43.280 --> 25:50.480\n you find in that part of the world is very, very complex language. Language that could be an\n\n25:50.480 --> 25:56.480\n inheritance, language that could be incredibly archaic, together with this recognition of self\n\n25:56.480 --> 26:01.440\n mortality. And when I talk to Lee Berger, we say, when you're looking at universals like that,\n\n26:01.440 --> 26:07.440\n language around all human populations, the recognition of self mortality, the contemplation\n\n26:07.440 --> 26:12.480\n of death, just maybe you have pharmacology. And so maybe we can go out and test for this\n\n26:13.200 --> 26:18.560\n using gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, proteomics, technology that doesn't even exist,\n\n26:18.560 --> 26:23.600\n but maybe we can actually test the stoned ape theory to figure out once and for all,\n\n26:23.600 --> 26:27.680\n if there's any merit there. Can you just linger a little bit on the pharmacology tools?\n\n26:27.680 --> 26:34.800\n Like how would it be possible to say something about what was being ingested so, so long ago?\n\n26:34.800 --> 26:43.680\n That's what I asked Dr. Berger. So Lee has discovered in the dental calculus of archaic\n\n26:43.680 --> 26:50.800\n hominids. Dental calculus. I like this. Evidence of their diet. And you might not believe how old\n\n26:50.800 --> 26:57.760\n this was, but in sedeba, Australopithecus sedeba, they found evidence of sedeba's diet going back\n\n26:57.760 --> 27:04.480\n two million years. So through things like phytoliths, which are essentially fossilized\n\n27:04.480 --> 27:12.240\n plant tissue, they found evidence that sedeba was eating bark and leaves and grasses and fruits and\n\n27:12.240 --> 27:18.080\n palm. So no psychedelics to speak of, but it just goes to show that through things like dental\n\n27:18.080 --> 27:23.040\n microwear analysis and other techniques that we're still developing, we can actually figure out what\n\n27:23.040 --> 27:29.040\n the diet was at the time. I'll fast forward to 50,000 years ago. There was another study out of\n\n27:29.040 --> 27:34.800\n El Cidr\u00f3n Cave in 2012, which found that Neanderthals, again, preceding our species\n\n27:34.800 --> 27:41.760\n 50,000 years ago, were ingesting yarrow and chamomile, which had been identified as medicinal.\n\n27:41.760 --> 27:47.360\n So again, not psychedelic or psychoactive, but we kind of have the beginnings of the technology,\n\n27:47.360 --> 27:53.840\n and that was nine years ago, to begin figuring out the ancestral diet of these hominids.\n\n27:53.840 --> 27:59.120\n Presumably there could be a way to figure out, it's not just diet, but which have psychoactive\n\n27:59.120 --> 28:03.200\n elements to them. So whether you're chewing it, whether you're smoking it, whether, I mean, I don't\n\n28:03.200 --> 28:08.800\n know, licking it. I don't know if there's any kind of ways through the dental calculus to figure out\n\n28:09.440 --> 28:15.200\n what exact substances were being consumed. Is it possible to figure out whether psychedelic\n\n28:15.200 --> 28:21.040\n substances are being consumed by looking at human behavior, like you said, organized burials\n\n28:22.640 --> 28:28.240\n or cave paintings? No, but so that's a little bit of a stretch to say, like, where did this\n\n28:28.240 --> 28:34.160\n leap come from? But it's not. It's not. So just last fall, as a matter of fact, so that notion\n\n28:34.160 --> 28:38.160\n has been out there for a while, the idea that hallucinogens and the ritual consumption of\n\n28:38.160 --> 28:43.760\n hallucinogens were somehow related to the great leap forward, were somehow related to the initial\n\n28:43.760 --> 28:48.080\n cave painting. Graham Hancock wrote a beautiful book about this called Supernatural, which in\n\n28:48.080 --> 28:53.840\n many ways like sent me down this rabbit hole back in 2007. But even at the time when he was writing\n\n28:53.840 --> 29:01.440\n that and the year subsequent, it was still kind of seen as a kooky idea. Last fall, interestingly\n\n29:01.440 --> 29:08.720\n enough, the first archeochemical data for the ritual consumption of psychedelics associated with\n\n29:08.720 --> 29:13.920\n cave art was finally published. It's not that ancient. It's only about 400 or 500 years ago,\n\n29:13.920 --> 29:19.680\n but it came from the Pinwheel Cave, a Chumash site in California. And what they found were\n\n29:19.680 --> 29:24.720\n datura quids, like these chewed up, you mentioned, how did they ingest it? These chewed up quids,\n\n29:24.720 --> 29:31.280\n like these bunches of datura, which contain these very powerful tropane alkaloids and what was\n\n29:31.280 --> 29:37.200\n believed to be some kind of Chumash initiation site. So we can say that there is initial\n\n29:37.200 --> 29:42.160\n archeochemical data for the consumption of psychedelics and cave art. And so where else\n\n29:42.160 --> 29:50.000\n might we find this? Are there a lot of archeochemists in the world? Is this fascinating? Is through\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:56.320\n chemistry, through biology, through physics, whatever, like all the disciplines, perhaps one\n\n29:56.320 --> 30:04.320\n day computer science, we apply those tools to study not the data of today, but the data of the past.\n\n30:04.320 --> 30:09.040\n But are we talking about dozens here? Like how hard is this problem relative to how many people\n\n30:09.040 --> 30:15.120\n are taking it on just as a side little tangent? We're probably talking more dozens than hundreds.\n\n30:16.080 --> 30:21.040\n I spent many years trying to track down an archeochemist who would talk to me. There were\n\n30:21.040 --> 30:27.520\n a couple, Pat McGovern at the University of Pennsylvania, and then my friend Andrew Ko at MIT,\n\n30:27.520 --> 30:33.200\n which you might know something about. Andrew really, you know, on his own time, on his own\n\n30:33.200 --> 30:41.440\n dime, has been gathering the data for this organic residue analysis. He has what's called the Open\n\n30:41.440 --> 30:46.880\n Archem Project, which is this online open source repository for this data. But there's never been\n\n30:46.880 --> 30:52.960\n a center for this. No university has stood up a dedicated center, a team really, which is what you\n\n30:52.960 --> 30:57.520\n need of archeochemists looking at this stuff. But I mean, even despite that, there have been some\n\n30:57.520 --> 31:02.320\n remarkable discoveries over the past 10, 20 years. It's still a discipline very much in\n\n31:02.320 --> 31:09.440\n its infancy. Maybe it's becoming a toddler. But as the technology gets better and cheaper, I hope\n\n31:09.440 --> 31:12.480\n you'll see more and more archeochemists joining the fight.\n\n31:12.480 --> 31:18.960\n Yeah. And Andrew is fascinating. His work is fascinating. But also, just because of your work,\n\n31:18.960 --> 31:24.880\n I came across and exchanged a few emails with Patrick McGovern, who's basically, what would\n\n31:24.880 --> 31:30.880\n you call him? So, he has a center, I guess, that does biomolecular archeology at UPenn.\n\n31:30.880 --> 31:36.800\n And he's the author of a bunch of books, one of which is Ancient Brews. So, he's a scholar of beer\n\n31:36.800 --> 31:42.560\n and wine and like ancient alcohol, which is fascinating. They influence, even just alcohol,\n\n31:42.560 --> 31:50.720\n but he has like alcohol with hallucinogenic properties as well. But as a Russian, it's\n\n31:50.720 --> 31:58.640\n fascinating to think about the influence of alcohol on the development of human civilization\n\n31:58.640 --> 32:05.600\n throughout its history. Is there something you can comment on alcohol or in general,\n\n32:07.120 --> 32:13.680\n Patrick's work that was informative to you, inspiring, or kind of added to your conception\n\n32:13.680 --> 32:15.280\n of human history?\n\n32:15.280 --> 32:20.880\n His work was some of the first hard scientific data that I saw for the ritual consumption\n\n32:20.880 --> 32:27.440\n of these intoxicants. I don't think he's ever found the hard and fast data for psychedelics.\n\n32:27.440 --> 32:33.040\n But what he turned me on to was this idea that alcohol or beer and wine specifically\n\n32:33.520 --> 32:37.520\n could have been used as vehicles for the administration of psychedelics. That's where\n\n32:37.520 --> 32:43.280\n it all started for me. Just the notion that ancient beer and ancient wine is very, very\n\n32:43.280 --> 32:48.880\n different from what we drink today, that typically they were cocktails. They were often fortified\n\n32:48.880 --> 32:55.280\n and mixed with different fruits, berries, herbs, plants, maybe even fungi over time,\n\n32:55.280 --> 33:00.800\n because this was all in the absence of distilled liquor. There is no hard alcohol, even in\n\n33:00.800 --> 33:08.000\n Russia, before maybe the 12th century it was in Europe, maybe a bit earlier. But the concept\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:15.040\n of distillation just didn't exist. And so, to pack a punch, rather than just drink a\n\n33:15.040 --> 33:20.640\n kind of watered down Budweiser, these people were interested in fortifying these beverages\n\n33:20.640 --> 33:25.920\n with whatever they could find in nature. And Pat, to his credit, found some of the initial\n\n33:25.920 --> 33:31.200\n data for these, you could say, spiked wines and spiked beers. Not with anything overtly\n\n33:31.200 --> 33:38.080\n psychedelic, but just the fact that in the 16th century BC, at grave circle A in Mycenae,\n\n33:38.080 --> 33:43.040\n there's this Minoan ritual cocktail of beer mixed with wine, mixed with mead, is very\n\n33:43.040 --> 33:48.320\n interesting. It's even more interesting that you find that across the Aegean, in Gordium,\n\n33:48.320 --> 33:54.560\n at King Midas's tomb, right? The same kind of ritual cocktail, which Pat and Sam at the\n\n33:54.560 --> 33:59.040\n Dogfish Head Brewery resurrected as the Midas touch. So, I mean, the notion that we can\n\n33:59.040 --> 34:05.280\n go back, find this data, resurrect it, in some cases, 2800 years later, I found pretty\n\n34:05.280 --> 34:11.520\n exciting 10 years ago. Yeah, bring it back for research. But that's fascinating that\n\n34:11.520 --> 34:16.880\n people are playing with these ideas. And we'll return to, we'll return to our\n\n34:16.880 --> 34:22.080\n ideas of psychedelic infused wine, which is pretty fascinating. But can we step back and\n\n34:22.080 --> 34:27.440\n just kind of look at your work with the book Immortality Key? What is the story that you\n\n34:27.440 --> 34:35.440\n tell in this book? I knew we'd get there eventually, Lex. It's a nonlinear path. Somehow\n\n34:35.440 --> 34:40.400\n we were talking about simulation and the universe is a computer that's creating video games\n\n34:40.400 --> 34:48.080\n and WoW and Fortnite. But we got there and we'll return, always, to the insane philosophical.\n\n34:48.080 --> 34:53.680\n But your book Immortality Key, what's the story that you tell in this book? Which part\n\n34:53.680 --> 34:57.840\n of human history are you studying? Right. So that's the way to phrase it. So it's, you\n\n34:57.840 --> 35:04.480\n know, it's my 12 year search for the hard scientific data for the ritual use of psychedelics\n\n35:04.480 --> 35:09.120\n in classical antiquity. So we're talking about amongst the ancient Greeks and Romans.\n\n35:09.120 --> 35:15.680\n And the paleo Christians. So the generations that would give birth to the largest religion\n\n35:15.680 --> 35:20.000\n the world's ever known. Christianity today was two and a half billion people. The big\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:23.920\n question for me is, you know, were psychedelics actually involved? There was a lot written\n\n35:23.920 --> 35:29.840\n about this in the sixties, John Marco Allegro. The book that I follow was published in 1978\n\n35:29.840 --> 35:35.040\n before I was born. The Road to Eleusis by Gordon Wasson, who we talked about already,\n\n35:35.040 --> 35:40.960\n Albert Hofmann, who famously discovers LSD or synthesizes it from ergot, and Carl Ruck,\n\n35:41.680 --> 35:48.000\n who is still a professor of classics at Boston University, the only surviving member of that\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:55.200\n renegade trio and now 85 years old. So this all predates us. But what was lacking in the 60s,\n\n35:55.200 --> 36:01.040\n 70s, 80s, 90s, I think was some of this technology and the hard scientific data.\n\n36:01.040 --> 36:05.760\n Now, for years and years, I went out to the archaeobotanists and the archaeochemists around\n\n36:05.760 --> 36:11.520\n the world and I asked a very basic question. Is there any evidence for psychedelics in classical\n\n36:11.520 --> 36:17.040\n antiquity? And the answer would almost invariably come back no. I'm talking to, in addition to Pat,\n\n36:17.040 --> 36:22.000\n he put me in touch with Hans Peter Sticke in Germany, Tania Valamotti in Greece,\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:26.880\n Assunta Florenzano in Italy. I went all over the place asking one question and getting the same\n\n36:26.880 --> 36:32.960\n answer back time and again. And so the book is essentially my search for that data and\n\n36:32.960 --> 36:41.760\n the eventual uncovering of two what I think are key pieces of data. One data point shows the ritual\n\n36:41.760 --> 36:48.640\n use of a psychedelic beer in classical antiquity in Iberia, what today is Spain. And the other\n\n36:48.640 --> 36:55.440\n shows what looks like a kind of psychedelic wine just outside Pompeii from the first century AD,\n\n36:55.440 --> 37:00.400\n at the right place at the right time when the earliest Christians were showing up in Italy.\n\n37:01.520 --> 37:05.760\n Again, these are early steps in the search for evidence in the space. But\n\n37:07.840 --> 37:15.360\n speaking of early Christians, what role do you think psychedelic infused wine could have played\n\n37:15.360 --> 37:27.600\n in the life of Jesus Christ? I've been saying recently that, and I hope this doesn't sound\n\n37:28.160 --> 37:36.000\n obscurantist, but I think it's impossible to understand Jesus and the birth of Christianity\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:40.720\n in the absence of ancient Greek. And I'll give you a very specific example of why I think that's the\n\n37:40.720 --> 37:49.280\n case. You can read the entire New Testament in ancient Greek and not once will you ever find\n\n37:49.280 --> 37:55.120\n a reference to alcohol because there was no word in ancient Greek for alcohol. The way the word\n\n37:55.120 --> 38:01.840\n sounds alcohol, it's Semitic, it comes from the Arabic. Kehela means to enliven or refresh. It\n\n38:01.840 --> 38:07.760\n probably comes from kohl, K O H L, sort of these powdered metallics that were used in alchemical\n\n38:07.760 --> 38:13.520\n experiments and cosmetics. So again, that's much later in time when we're using alchemy,\n\n38:13.520 --> 38:21.280\n distillation, et cetera. In the first century AD, the power of wine wasn't necessarily tied to\n\n38:21.280 --> 38:26.720\n alcohol, fermented grapes, the way we think about wine today. So Pat McGovern found some of that\n\n38:26.720 --> 38:34.720\n early organic data for wine being mixed with beer and with mead. But if you look at the literature\n\n38:34.720 --> 38:39.440\n from the first century AD, Dioscorides, for example, he writes this massive treatise at the\n\n38:39.440 --> 38:45.600\n exact same time the gospels are being written. And Dioscorides in just one of his books talks about\n\n38:45.600 --> 38:53.520\n 56 detailed recipes for spiking wine with all kinds of things like salvia and hellebore and\n\n38:53.520 --> 38:58.880\n frankincense and myrrh, these spice perfumes, but also more dangerous things like henbane\n\n38:58.880 --> 39:05.360\n and mandrake, which he says in Greek can be fatal with just one cupful. And in book 474 of his\n\n39:05.360 --> 39:14.560\n Materia Medica, he talks about black nightshade producing fantasias u aedais, not unpleasant\n\n39:14.560 --> 39:20.560\n visions, what today we would say is psychedelic. So just looking at the literature and the kind of\n\n39:20.560 --> 39:25.040\n literature that even most classicists, I didn't really learn it in undergrad, I came across\n\n39:25.040 --> 39:32.880\n Dioscorides later, but just a basic look at the literature supports what McGovern has been testing,\n\n39:32.880 --> 39:38.560\n which is the fact that wine was routinely mixed with different compounds. It's fascinating,\n\n39:38.560 --> 39:44.800\n by the way, that language affects our conception of the tools we use to understand the world. So\n\n39:44.800 --> 39:56.720\n like you can see wine, you can see psychedelics, if they're not called drugs, you can maybe reframe\n\n39:57.840 --> 40:02.240\n how you see them in terms of their role in us thinking about the world, understanding the\n\n40:02.240 --> 40:06.320\n world. That's really interesting that language has that power, but what language was used to\n\n40:06.320 --> 40:11.840\n understand wine at the time? So we're talking about a Greek speaking world, right? So Jesus\n\n40:11.840 --> 40:16.880\n is born and does his public ministry in the Holy Land, but think about the early church,\n\n40:16.880 --> 40:22.160\n think about where the church takes root. Paul, the greatest evangelist of the time, writes basically\n\n40:22.160 --> 40:27.920\n half the New Testament, he's writing letters in Greek to Greek speakers in places like Corinth\n\n40:28.480 --> 40:35.520\n in Greece, or Philippi, a defunct city just north of the island of Thassos, or he's writing to folks\n\n40:35.520 --> 40:40.560\n in what today is Turkey, the Colossians, the Galatians, he writes letters to the Romans.\n\n40:40.560 --> 40:46.000\n These are Greek speakers in these pockets, these Hellenic pockets all around the ancient\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:51.680\n Mediterranean. And for them, again, ignore Dioscorides, ignore Pat McGovern's work,\n\n40:51.680 --> 40:58.240\n to them to think about wine was to think about a mixed potion. And so the word oinos in ancient\n\n40:58.240 --> 41:02.880\n Greek does show up in the New Testament, but there was another word to describe wine,\n\n41:02.880 --> 41:08.880\n and it exists for like a thousand years before, during, and after the life of Jesus. The word\n\n41:08.880 --> 41:14.400\n used for wine is pharmakon, which obviously gives us the word pharmacy, it means drug.\n\n41:14.400 --> 41:20.400\n So in Greek, a Greek speaker would actually use the word drug to refer to wine. Ruth Skodel,\n\n41:20.400 --> 41:27.920\n the classicist, talks about this as a ritualistic formula. They understood wine as this compound\n\n41:27.920 --> 41:35.920\n beverage, a drug against grief, a medicinal elixir that could either harm or heal, or just maybe a\n\n41:35.920 --> 41:45.840\n sacrament to put you in touch with wine gods old and new. Clearly, religion and myth, but religion\n\n41:45.840 --> 41:55.840\n very much so has sort of a, much like dreams, has like an imagery component. Like you're kind of\n\n41:55.840 --> 42:04.160\n going outside the visual constraints of physical space where you kind of have very specific\n\n42:04.160 --> 42:11.120\n conceptions of what things look like, and you kind of use your imagination to stretch beyond\n\n42:11.120 --> 42:16.240\n the world as we know it. Things that are trying to get in touch with things that are more real\n\n42:16.240 --> 42:26.320\n than real. What role do these tools, do these pharmakons have in trying to stimulate the imagery\n\n42:26.320 --> 42:32.160\n of religion? Do you have a sense that they have a critical role here, or is it just a bunch of\n\n42:32.160 --> 42:36.800\n different factors that are utilized, a bunch of different tools that are utilized to construct\n\n42:36.800 --> 42:41.600\n this imagery? Or is this not even, or is imagery the wrong terminology? Is it more like space of\n\n42:41.600 --> 42:48.480\n ideas that's core to religion? No, I think the wine is absolutely essential. And so, if it's\n\n42:48.480 --> 42:53.600\n impossible to understand paleo Christianity in the absence of ancient Greek, I think it's equally\n\n42:53.600 --> 43:00.640\n difficult in the absence of the sacred pharmacopeia or wine itself, right? Just think about wine\n\n43:00.640 --> 43:05.680\n at the time. I think that the ancient Greek audience would have heard that in a very different\n\n43:05.680 --> 43:11.840\n way from us. And so, they're referring to it maybe as a pharmakon, but the followers of Dionysus,\n\n43:11.840 --> 43:18.240\n which precedes Jesus. And in some cases, the story of Jesus is kind of a recapitulation of the\n\n43:18.240 --> 43:23.520\n mysteries of Dionysus. But when you think about Dionysus, maybe from your high school mythology,\n\n43:23.520 --> 43:28.400\n you think about him as the god of theater, or the god of wine, which is typically what it is,\n\n43:28.400 --> 43:38.000\n or the god of ecstasy. Again, Dionysus is not the god of alcohol. There's no concept of fermented\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:42.400\n grapes. The power of Dionysus and the ability to commune with Dionysus through his blood.\n\n43:43.200 --> 43:49.440\n And before Christianity, the blood of Dionysus is equated to his wine. The sacramental drinking of\n\n43:49.440 --> 43:55.040\n the wine was interpreted, and classicists write about this, including Walter Burkert. It was\n\n43:55.040 --> 44:00.720\n it was interpreted as consuming the god himself in order to become one with the god. This is where we\n\n44:00.720 --> 44:06.400\n get the idea of enthusiasm, because the language matters. Enthusiasm to be filled with the spirit\n\n44:06.400 --> 44:11.680\n of the god, so that you became identified with Dionysus and acquired his divine powers.\n\n44:11.680 --> 44:16.240\n Now, how does that happen? Again, he's not the god of alcohol. He is the god of wine,\n\n44:16.240 --> 44:22.880\n but he's really the god of madness, and delirium, and frenzy. And his principal followers are women.\n\n44:22.880 --> 44:27.520\n They're called the minads. And the way they get in touch with him is through the consumption\n\n44:27.520 --> 44:34.880\n of this sacramental wine. Even at the theater of Dionysus, separate from his outdoor churches,\n\n44:34.880 --> 44:40.400\n there was a wine served there called drima. And this is the wine that gives birth to Hollywood.\n\n44:40.400 --> 44:44.160\n I mean, the ancient Hollywood was there at the theater of Dionysus. This is where\n\n44:44.160 --> 44:48.960\n comedy, and tragedy, and poetry, and music come from. But rather than a hot dog and a beer,\n\n44:48.960 --> 44:53.760\n what they drink at the theater of Dionysus was this wine called drima, which means\n\n44:53.760 --> 44:58.560\n pounded or rubbed. And Professor Ruck talks about maybe it was the drugs\n\n44:58.560 --> 45:04.880\n that were rubbed into this theatrical beverage to help the play come alive.\n\n45:04.880 --> 45:13.280\n So madness is seen as a positive thing, as like a creative journey. It's not, what is it,\n\n45:13.280 --> 45:20.560\n the unlearning, getting out of the way kind of thing. Is that how it's seen? Or is it more like\n\n45:20.560 --> 45:31.840\n entertaining escape from life that is suffering? I gotta inject a little modern Dostoevsky into the old.\n\n45:31.840 --> 45:39.200\n Existential despair. Maybe it's a bit of that. We can't say that there wasn't\n\n45:39.200 --> 45:46.080\n recreational drinking happening. The Greeks also had the symposium. And they also were just\n\n45:46.080 --> 45:53.280\n getting hammered in some cases. But when it comes to the rites of Dionysus, what you see there is\n\n45:54.480 --> 46:00.960\n the creation of these states of awareness in which, again, you identify with the God to become\n\n46:00.960 --> 46:06.640\n the God. There's theophagy. There's the consumption of divinity in order to become divinity. Right\n\n46:06.640 --> 46:12.480\n back to how we started the conversation, right? So if we stop conceiving of God as something\n\n46:12.480 --> 46:18.480\n exterior to us, but that the mystery of being itself is the mystery of your being and the\n\n46:18.480 --> 46:24.640\n mystery of my being, that the way to encounter that is through the sacramental theology, that\n\n46:24.640 --> 46:31.520\n you drink the actual blood of this Greek God to become that God. And there was a place for this\n\n46:31.520 --> 46:37.360\n in ancient Greek society. So drinking the wine and drinking the blood of Dionysus, do you think Jesus\n\n46:38.480 --> 46:45.840\n is an actual physical person that existed in history? Or is he an idea\n\n46:47.040 --> 46:54.000\n that came to life through the consumption of wine and those kinds of rituals?\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:57.360\n So this is where I face my excommunication, depending how I answer this.\n\n46:57.360 --> 47:03.200\n I mean, you're playing with fire and wine.\n\n47:03.200 --> 47:06.240\n A good combination, by the way.\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:14.400\n So I shy away from that controversy in the book. I'm perfectly willing to accept Jesus\n\n47:14.400 --> 47:19.440\n as a historical personage. We have the multiplicity of sources, although it's a\n\n47:19.440 --> 47:25.280\n generation after his death. But we have the Eucharist being described in the four gospels.\n\n47:25.280 --> 47:31.040\n We have it being described by Paul in 1 Corinthians. But when you read John,\n\n47:31.040 --> 47:35.280\n it does read a bit differently than the other gospels. And in my book, I rely a lot on the\n\n47:35.280 --> 47:40.000\n scholarship of Dennis McDonald, who writes a fabulous book called The Dionysian Gospel.\n\n47:40.560 --> 47:45.120\n And this is, again, why the Greek matters, because once you start to analyze the Greek of John's\n\n47:45.120 --> 47:51.520\n gospel, it seems to be a presentation of Jesus very much in the guise of Dionysus. The most\n\n47:51.520 --> 47:57.280\n obvious example is the wedding at Cana, right? That only occurs in John's gospel, the famous\n\n47:57.280 --> 48:02.000\n transformation of water into wine. Now, again, to any Greek speaker of the first century,\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:07.600\n they would have known about the Greek district of Elis on the Peloponnese. And in Elis,\n\n48:07.600 --> 48:14.080\n around the epiphany, every January, the priests of Dionysus would deposit these water basins,\n\n48:14.080 --> 48:19.760\n empty basins in the temple of Dionysus. They'd return the next morning and find them magically\n\n48:19.760 --> 48:25.360\n filled with wine. Now, on the island of Andros, it's even more interesting. Around the same\n\n48:25.360 --> 48:31.760\n epiphany date, the God's gift day, Dies Theodosia, the wine would emanate from the temple and run\n\n48:31.760 --> 48:37.440\n like a river for a week. And you can Google the Bacchanal of the Andrians, a wonderful painting\n\n48:37.440 --> 48:42.080\n by Titian, which hangs in the Prado, and you'll see a river of wine behind these people having\n\n48:42.080 --> 48:47.520\n a great time. This exists for centuries and centuries before the wedding at Cana and before\n\n48:47.520 --> 48:55.040\n Jesus begins his public ministry with what these scholars call the signature miracle of Dionysus.\n\n48:55.040 --> 49:00.880\n It would not have been lost on the Greek audience that something very specific is being communicated\n\n49:00.880 --> 49:07.120\n here. What's being communicated? That you just might find in early Christianity what you hold\n\n49:07.120 --> 49:11.760\n strong to in these mysteries of Dionysus that you may have inherited from your parents, your\n\n49:11.760 --> 49:16.480\n grandparents, your great grandparents for centuries. There was a perfectly good religion.\n\n49:16.480 --> 49:20.400\n There were perfectly good mystery cults in the ancient Greek and Roman worlds.\n\n49:20.400 --> 49:27.040\n And here comes this new, untested, illegal cult, illegal, of a dozen or so illiterate\n\n49:27.040 --> 49:32.400\n day laborers that go on to convert the empire in a few hundred years. The answer to that\n\n49:33.440 --> 49:38.320\n extraordinary growth is not psychedelics, but I do think it's visionary experiences,\n\n49:38.320 --> 49:42.800\n and I do think it's this continuity from the pagan world into early Christianity.\n\n49:42.800 --> 49:47.200\n So what part, you mentioned this idea that's really interesting with, I think you said Paul\n\n49:47.200 --> 49:56.800\n Stamets, of I guess millions of people over millions of years kind of consuming, really\n\n49:56.800 --> 50:02.000\n practicing a ritual or a habit of some sort. This idea of rituals is kind of interesting.\n\n50:02.800 --> 50:08.640\n Again, you mentioned cult. What's the role of ritual consumption of some of these substances\n\n50:08.640 --> 50:15.760\n or just ritual practice of anything in the intellectual growth of particular groups of\n\n50:15.760 --> 50:22.160\n people or societies? So again, I would say it is the centerpiece of ancient life, not just the\n\n50:22.160 --> 50:27.040\n mysteries of Dionysus, which we've only talked a bit about, but the mysteries of Eleusis were\n\n50:27.040 --> 50:32.240\n probably the most famous and longest lasting of these Greek mystery rites. And I mean, just to\n\n50:32.240 --> 50:37.040\n put it in simple terms, the best definition for a mystery religion, as the name implies,\n\n50:37.040 --> 50:42.880\n is something secret, right? Muo from the Greek means to shut the eyes or to shut the mouth,\n\n50:42.880 --> 50:49.840\n to keep quiet about this stuff. We're always teasing details from the archaeological and the\n\n50:49.840 --> 50:56.240\n literary record, and we're kind of just grabbing at these secrets. But Eleusis, which survives for\n\n50:56.240 --> 51:02.480\n like 2,000 years into the Christian period from about 1500 BC to the fourth century AD,\n\n51:02.480 --> 51:08.160\n it's kind of this centerpiece of Greek life. Cicero, the great Roman statesman, calls what was\n\n51:08.160 --> 51:15.120\n happening at Eleusis the most exceptional and divine thing that Athens ever produced. So not\n\n51:15.120 --> 51:21.200\n democracy, the arts and sciences, or philosophy, but the vision that was encountered at Eleusis,\n\n51:21.200 --> 51:27.680\n perhaps through the ritual consumption of a potent psychedelic over hundreds and hundreds of years,\n\n51:27.680 --> 51:32.960\n hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands and thousands, if not millions of initiates, pilgrims,\n\n51:32.960 --> 51:38.160\n who would walk from Athens to Eleusis to encounter this vision. It seems to have been\n\n51:39.120 --> 51:43.120\n not just an important part of Greek life, but the thing that made life livable,\n\n51:43.680 --> 51:49.040\n such that as these mysteries are about to be exterminated by the newly Christianized\n\n51:49.040 --> 51:53.920\n Roman Empire, there's this passage in the ancient literature that talks about these,\n\n51:53.920 --> 51:58.080\n you know, in the absence of these mysteries, life becomes unlivable. Abiotos.\n\n51:58.720 --> 52:03.440\n Is there ways you can, I mean, you write about the mysteries of Eleusis, and is there ways you\n\n52:03.440 --> 52:11.520\n can convert that into words? Why those are so important to them, more important than any other\n\n52:11.520 --> 52:19.520\n invention to them? Why is it such a source of meaning to life? So from what we can reconstruct,\n\n52:19.520 --> 52:25.120\n they would make that pilgrimage 13 miles northwest of Athens to confront their mortality. Remember,\n\n52:25.120 --> 52:30.160\n we were talking about Homo Naledi, and in South Africa, this recognition of self mortality,\n\n52:31.280 --> 52:38.080\n the deliberate disposal of the dead. Plato talks about the real practice of philosophy being the\n\n52:38.080 --> 52:45.200\n death and dying process. So in some senses, you went to Eleusis to die and to experience a death\n\n52:45.200 --> 52:50.080\n before your death. We talked about this with Terence McKenna as well, on this, how the\n\n52:50.080 --> 52:55.840\n psychedelic state seems to share something in common with the near death or out of body experiences\n\n52:55.840 --> 53:01.120\n or these ecstatic experiences, whether through wine or beer or otherwise, you went to Eleusis\n\n53:01.120 --> 53:07.360\n to die. And it was said that only those who had witnessed this vision, whatever vision was to be\n\n53:07.360 --> 53:14.080\n witnessed in Demeter Sanctuary, it essentially vouchsafed you the afterlife, that only those who\n\n53:14.080 --> 53:21.280\n went there became immortal. And Cicero says that at that point, you essentially live with more joy\n\n53:21.280 --> 53:27.520\n and die with a better hope. Can I ask you a question about this human contention with death,\n\n53:27.520 --> 53:34.000\n this confrontation of death that seems to be at the core of things? I don't know how deep to the\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:41.920\n core, but it seems to be a central element of the human condition. What do you think about Ernest\n\n53:41.920 --> 53:51.840\n Becker and those guys that put death at the, what is it, the warm of the core, which as the main\n\n53:51.840 --> 53:58.640\n thing, the main, like this confrontation of our own mortality, first of all, being understanding\n\n53:58.640 --> 54:06.400\n that we're mortal and then confronting the terror of it, the fear of it as the creative, like trying\n\n54:06.400 --> 54:13.200\n to escape the fear of death as the creative force of human society. It's like the reason we do\n\n54:13.200 --> 54:21.760\n anything is because we're just running away from our death, scared. Do you find some of that to be\n\n54:21.760 --> 54:27.200\n true, first of all, as somebody who looks in the mirror, looks at yourself and your own as a human\n\n54:27.200 --> 54:34.080\n being, two, just looking at society today, and three, at this whole big spread of human history\n\n54:34.080 --> 54:39.920\n and all the cool stuff we've created, including the mysteries of Eleusis? I wonder what life would\n\n54:39.920 --> 54:46.880\n look like in the absence of the fear of our mortality. I wonder how we'd interact with one\n\n54:46.880 --> 54:52.400\n another if there was relatively little or no fear of death. I really do when it comes to Becker's\n\n54:52.400 --> 54:58.480\n work and others. If the ancients were known for anything, it was running to death. It was the\n\n54:58.480 --> 55:02.640\n opposite. In fact, dying before dying, which is the immortality key, by the way, it's not\n\n55:02.640 --> 55:07.280\n psychedelics. When I refer to this key, I'm referring to this notion that's preserved in\n\n55:07.280 --> 55:15.120\n Greek, anpethanis, prinpethanis, denthapethanis, otanpethanis. If you die before you die, you won't\n\n55:15.120 --> 55:22.480\n die when you die. For some reason, the ancients prized that experience. And we talked about the\n\n55:22.480 --> 55:29.520\n mystics of Sufism and Kabbalism and Christian mysticism, where you have this same self nodding,\n\n55:29.520 --> 55:34.640\n this death before death, the divine nothingness, right? For some reason, the mystic saints,\n\n55:34.640 --> 55:40.160\n visionaries, and ancient philosophers, they ran to death. And the one message I wanted to try and\n\n55:40.160 --> 55:46.400\n communicate with this book is how they viewed life, that it can only be fully experienced,\n\n55:46.400 --> 55:55.120\n fully embodied in the wake of a really intense, perhaps terrifying, but utterly transformational\n\n55:55.120 --> 56:02.720\n encounter with death. So running to death, not running away from death. You talk about Aldous\n\n56:02.720 --> 56:13.600\n Huxley and mind changers. So if we look at the history where the ancients were running to death\n\n56:13.600 --> 56:23.200\n and maybe using some performance enhancing permacons to run more effectively towards death,\n\n56:23.200 --> 56:31.680\n and now we're using tools of modern society, whether they're psychological, sociological,\n\n56:31.680 --> 56:39.600\n or in case pharmaceutical to run away from this conception. So what do you see as a hopeful future\n\n56:39.600 --> 56:48.000\n for human civilization? If all of these kinds of societies are ice cream flavors,\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:53.520\n how do you create the perfect ice cream flavor? What is the future of religious experience,\n\n56:53.520 --> 56:59.680\n of psychedelic experience, of intellectual journeys, of facing death, running away from death?\n\n57:00.240 --> 57:05.600\n What do you hope that looks like and what kind of ideas should we look to?\n\n57:05.600 --> 57:11.920\n My next book will be entitled Performance Enhancing Pharmacon. You get full copyright.\n\n57:11.920 --> 57:22.160\n Yeah, I like it. But that's a historical view. What in that book would you suggest\n\n57:22.160 --> 57:27.920\n in one of the last chapters about the future of this process?\n\n57:27.920 --> 57:34.640\n Well, Huxley has to stop you. He stopped me in my tracks, Aldous Huxley. So in 1958,\n\n57:34.640 --> 57:43.440\n he pens this op ed of sorts, and it reads incredibly prescient because I really do think\n\n57:43.440 --> 57:51.040\n in many ways as the fog of the war drug is ending and finally lifting that we've kind of come full\n\n57:51.040 --> 57:57.120\n circle back to the late 1950s, which might sound strange. It'll make more sense when you hear what\n\n57:57.120 --> 58:02.880\n Huxley said about psychedelics. And so he was looking forward to a revival of religion, which\n\n58:02.880 --> 58:12.000\n is why I subtitled the book, The Religion with No Name. And to him, to Huxley, this revival wouldn't\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:18.880\n come about through televangelistic mass meetings or photogenic clergymen, as he says, but he points\n\n58:18.880 --> 58:25.520\n to the biochemical discoveries such as we have today that would allow for large numbers of men\n\n58:25.520 --> 58:31.600\n and women to achieve a radical self transcendence and a deeper understanding of the nature of things.\n\n58:31.600 --> 58:36.560\n In other words, that this revival of religion, he says, would be a revolution. Alan Watts comes\n\n58:36.560 --> 58:44.240\n along and says that there's nothing more dangerous to authority than a popular outbreak of mysticism.\n\n58:44.240 --> 58:50.240\n But I think this is what Huxley was pointing to. And he talks about religion in these terms about\n\n58:50.240 --> 58:57.280\n being less about symbols and returning to a sense of experience and intuition. And Huxley says that\n\n58:57.280 --> 59:04.400\n he envisions a religion which gives rise to everyday mysticism. And he talks about something\n\n59:04.400 --> 59:11.120\n that would undergird everyday rationality, everyday tasks and duties, and everyday human\n\n59:11.120 --> 59:17.440\n relationships. In other words, religion has to mean something. And these altered states of\n\n59:17.440 --> 59:23.520\n awareness that we seem to be able to produce quite easily inside the lab at Hopkins, NYU,\n\n59:23.520 --> 59:30.560\n and elsewhere with psilocybin. I think this is kind of part of Huxley's prediction about a time\n\n59:31.200 --> 59:37.520\n when we would have legal access, safe access, efficacious access to this material that would\n\n59:37.520 --> 59:44.640\n allow for insight in an afternoon. And what do you do when millions of people can become mystics in\n\n59:44.640 --> 59:54.800\n an afternoon? So psychedelics, psilocybin might be sort of the practical way of having these kinds of\n\n59:55.760 --> 1:00:01.360\n maybe could be termed religious experiences. And then many people partaking in those experiences\n\n1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:05.280\n and then like evolving this collective intelligence thing we've got going on,\n\n1:00:06.160 --> 1:00:10.880\n that's sort of the practice of religion that we should be striving for as opposed to kind of\n\n1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:19.280\n operating in the space of ideas, actually practicing it. You mentioned, and that's the\n\n1:00:19.280 --> 1:00:27.280\n religion with no name, the use of these tools. Is there a simple way to summarize religion for our\n\n1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:33.440\n previous discussion about God, basically discovering the God inside? What if I give you a very\n\n1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:39.440\n complicated definition of religion and then we talk about a more simplified? Let's do it. So\n\n1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:44.160\n the most complicated we can get on this is the anthropologist Clifford Geertz. But I think it's\n\n1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:49.920\n worth defining our terms when we're talking about God and religion. So religion religio from the\n\n1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:55.040\n Latin means to bind back. So to bind us back to some meaningful tradition, to bind us back to the\n\n1:00:55.040 --> 1:01:03.040\n source. Here's a mouthful from Clifford Geertz. Religion, he defines as a set of symbols which\n\n1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:09.440\n acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long lasting moods and motivations by formulating\n\n1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:14.400\n conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing those conceptions in such an aura of\n\n1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:23.200\n factuality that those moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic, which is complex. What does\n\n1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:29.280\n that mean? That religion has to make you feel something, these moods and motivations. But it\n\n1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:35.040\n can't just do that in the way that sex does that for us or sports or ultimate fighting or the World\n\n1:01:35.040 --> 1:01:41.760\n Cup or going to a concert. So we get all that emotion in these experiences like that. But that\n\n1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:47.680\n emotion has to be concomitant to a deep existential insight that answers this question for you in the\n\n1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:53.200\n morning. I know why I'm here. I know why humans are here. I think I know what the meaning of life\n\n1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:59.280\n is. That's what religion is. And if you find that meaning in science, then that's your religion and\n\n1:01:59.280 --> 1:02:05.920\n that's fine. But we need to be more honest about that. If your epistemological model is weighing\n\n1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:10.080\n facts and figures and you think that's why you're here on this planet and you find deep meaning,\n\n1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:15.920\n that's okay. Religion is the thing that makes you feel, right? It has the aura of factuality. It\n\n1:02:15.920 --> 1:02:22.160\n just makes you feel like you know the point behind existence. In other words, I think it can be\n\n1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:25.680\n in other words, I think it comes down to experience. Like Joe Campbell was talking about,\n\n1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:30.480\n like Aldous Huxley mentions about experience and intuition. I think this is how we connect to God.\n\n1:02:32.240 --> 1:02:38.800\n Make you feel like you understand the world. I mean, so that's kind of bigger than science.\n\n1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:47.120\n That includes science, but it's bigger. Do you think, what is real? Like do you think there's\n\n1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:53.360\n an absolute reality that we're kind of striving towards understanding or is it all just conjured\n\n1:02:53.360 --> 1:03:00.400\n up in our minds? And that's the whole kind of point. We together create these realities and\n\n1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:08.960\n play with them and dance to somehow derive meaning from those realities. And it's ultimately not like\n\n1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:18.320\n like very deeply integrated into what's like into atoms of space time. Another easy question, Lex.\n\n1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:23.760\n Well, I mean, you have to kind of, when you're thinking about\n\n1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:32.240\n emotion and making it concrete into something that feels real, you have to start asking,\n\n1:03:32.240 --> 1:03:40.240\n like, what is real? It's something that Ben Shapiro has this saying of facts don't care\n\n1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:46.240\n about your feelings. I was always uncomfortable with this. I mean, he's just being spiffy or\n\n1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:53.360\n whatever, but I was always uncomfortable with somehow first that the hubris of thinking that\n\n1:03:53.360 --> 1:04:02.480\n humans can have, like arrive at absolute truth, which is what I assume he means by facts,\n\n1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:09.280\n like things that are uncontrovertible. And then somehow deriding feelings, like feelings are not\n\n1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:18.400\n important. To me, like the whole thing is reality. The facts don't even, like facts is reality,\n\n1:04:18.400 --> 1:04:24.240\n feelings are reality, like the entirety of human experience is reality. All these\n\n1:04:24.240 --> 1:04:29.680\n consciousnesses somehow interacting together, making up random crap and together agreeing\n\n1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:34.640\n they're all going to wear the same colors, rooting for one football team or the other football team\n\n1:04:34.640 --> 1:04:40.800\n or countries, all those things, that's real because we've agreed that it's real.\n\n1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:45.760\n And in the same way, it gives us meaning in that same way religion is a set of ideas that\n\n1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:58.400\n gives us meaning, but real, it's really difficult for me as a scientist that finds comfort in the\n\n1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:04.640\n physical understanding of the universe of physics. I love physics. I love computer science.\n\n1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:11.680\n It makes me feel like everything is perfectly understandable. And then I look at humans,\n\n1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:17.760\n humans, they're totally not understandable. It's like a giant mess, but that's part of the beauty.\n\n1:05:17.760 --> 1:05:26.880\n Like what is love? Like what the hell is love? It's certainly not like a weird hack to convince me\n\n1:05:26.880 --> 1:05:32.000\n to procreate because it feels something bigger than that. So like taking a purely evolutionary\n\n1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:37.520\n biologist perspective, it's missing the, it's not missing, it's only capturing a part of the picture.\n\n1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:44.400\n And so it just keeps making me ask, what is real? Because as a human, it's very human centric.\n\n1:05:44.400 --> 1:05:53.120\n It does certainly feel like a part, a big part of what is real is all the fake stuff my mind makes up.\n\n1:05:57.120 --> 1:06:01.280\n I mean, okay, I guess, is there something you could say\n\n1:06:01.280 --> 1:06:06.320\n from our discussions about the tools of psychedelics, about our discussion about\n\n1:06:06.320 --> 1:06:10.960\n religion, of what is real, of what is reality?\n\n1:06:11.920 --> 1:06:15.120\n These are largely unanswerable questions.\n\n1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:19.920\n But we should nevertheless strive to answer them. That's the whole point of the human experience.\n\n1:06:19.920 --> 1:06:24.240\n And I think science is one way and religion is another. And I think there's actually a sphere\n\n1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:30.000\n where they intersect, you know, there's a way for religion to be a big part of the world.\n\n1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:35.440\n Religion to be observable, testable, repeatable, falsifiable. When I look at the ancient mysteries,\n\n1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:41.600\n that's what I find. I find people exploring alternate states of consciousness and arriving\n\n1:06:41.600 --> 1:06:46.880\n at conclusions based on that exploration and deriving deep meaning from that, which yes,\n\n1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:51.200\n are feelings and emotions and very hard to quantify. But nonetheless, these are the things\n\n1:06:51.200 --> 1:06:56.640\n that govern our lives. I mean, I don't know a parent who isn't motivated by the love of their\n\n1:06:56.640 --> 1:07:03.360\n children. Everything I do at 40 years old now is pretty much inspired by my love for my two\n\n1:07:03.360 --> 1:07:08.560\n daughters. And I can't prove to you that I love them. I can say it, I can show you behavior,\n\n1:07:08.560 --> 1:07:15.520\n but it's very hard for me to weigh and measure that. So not everything is so reducible to this\n\n1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:23.200\n quantifiable reality. And yet, I also love science. And I love the historical process of weighing this\n\n1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:29.440\n data. I love the chemistry. I love the biology. And for me, I think this was the message of the\n\n1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:34.880\n ancient Greeks. And I think this is the world in which paleo Christianity was born. I think there\n\n1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:43.520\n is this meeting ground between science and religion, which allow for the, if not the discovery,\n\n1:07:43.520 --> 1:07:50.240\n then at least the near identification of the ultimate reality, which is another way to describe\n\n1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:55.360\n God, right? This being of being is the transcendent mystery. So speaking of God,\n\n1:07:56.240 --> 1:08:03.680\n you mentioned to me offline, you're wearing the most sophisticated clothing choice of the elite\n\n1:08:03.680 --> 1:08:08.400\n intellectuals. Like you mentioned, Sam Harris was wearing a hoodie. This is the Sam Harris hoodie.\n\n1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:14.240\n He's starting a trend. He's starting a trend. This is a new religion, you could even say. It's\n\n1:08:14.240 --> 1:08:22.320\n a ritual. It's a ritual practice of intellectuals of searching for meaning. So there's quite a\n\n1:08:22.320 --> 1:08:29.760\n fascinating debate. So he was for a time still known as one of the sort of new age atheists.\n\n1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:35.520\n So he was kind of trying to explore the role of religion in society and the role of science.\n\n1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:40.800\n And then on the other side, another kind of powerhouse intellectual is Jordan Peterson,\n\n1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:48.240\n who in sometimes, for my taste, a bit too poetic of ways is exploring the ideas of religion.\n\n1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:54.640\n And they had these interesting debates that I think will continue about the role of religion\n\n1:08:54.640 --> 1:09:05.920\n in society. For Jordan, there's all these flaws with religion, but there is a lot of value to be\n\n1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:12.880\n discovered amidst the rituals, the traditions, the practice, the way we conceive of each other\n\n1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:20.080\n because of the ideas that religion propagates. And then for Sam, it says that everything about\n\n1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:29.360\n religion basically gets in the way of us fully realizing our human potential, which is deeply\n\n1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:39.760\n scientific and rational and sort of like we're surrounded by mystery. Calling that mystery God\n\n1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:45.200\n is getting in the way of us understanding that mystery. What do you think about this debate\n\n1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:48.240\n about the role of religion in society?\n\n1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:52.560\n We should continue having this debate. I talked to Jordan a couple of weeks ago, as a matter of fact.\n\n1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:55.120\n Excellent. On his podcast? Public? Excellent.\n\n1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:59.360\n Yes. It'll be out soon. And so, he and I...\n\n1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:01.120\n How did that go, by the way?\n\n1:10:02.320 --> 1:10:06.400\n It was incredible. Carl Ruck, the professor, joined us, as a matter of fact, for one of his\n\n1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:13.360\n rare public appearances. We went deep. And Jordan is very well read, obviously, on the psychedelic\n\n1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:18.640\n literature. He had just had Roland Griffiths from Hopkins on the podcast. And it's one of\n\n1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:23.920\n Roland's figures that Jordan and I, again, just like the language of Aldous Huxley, it's hard to\n\n1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:30.800\n move past the following statistic. Over the past 20 years of the modern study of psilocybin, Roland\n\n1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:36.800\n will tell you that about three in four of their volunteers walk away from their single dose of\n\n1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:43.040\n psilocybin, high dose, saying it was among the most meaningful experiences of their entire lives,\n\n1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:53.600\n if not the most meaningful. And Jordan says, what do you do with that? How do we synthesize that?\n\n1:10:55.280 --> 1:11:02.640\n Here we are quantifying the qualifiable, the unqualifiable. And yet, these compounds have\n\n1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:08.880\n dramatic effects on people's lives, and they walk away feeling like they're more loving,\n\n1:11:08.880 --> 1:11:16.720\n more compassionate. The science of all talks about the welling up of cooperation and resource sharing\n\n1:11:16.720 --> 1:11:22.000\n and kindness and all these strange things from this single chemical intervention, which seems to\n\n1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:28.800\n reduce us to automata, as if enlightenment can be flipped on like a switch. And yet, there it is,\n\n1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:33.120\n there's the data. And I don't see how you walk away from that. I mean, I completely understand\n\n1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:39.360\n Sam's position. But I think there's a reading of religion, particularly the mystical core\n\n1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:45.040\n of the big faiths, and especially these ancient mystery cults, which do speak, again, to those\n\n1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:52.640\n moods and motivations, creating this aura of factuality that these volunteers never walk away\n\n1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:57.600\n from, permanently transformed, just like the ancient mysteries. And part of that is perhaps\n\n1:11:57.600 --> 1:12:06.640\n language, that we need to continue to evolve language in how we conceive of these processes.\n\n1:12:06.640 --> 1:12:13.280\n Maybe religion has a bunch of baggage associated with it that is good to let go of,\n\n1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:20.000\n or perhaps not. I don't know. This is connected to our previous part of our conversation is the\n\n1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.360\n importance of language in this whole thing. Well, that's how I start my book with one of\n\n1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:27.920\n these volunteers from the NYU psilocybin experiments, this woman, Dina Dina Baser,\n\n1:12:27.920 --> 1:12:34.080\n who's an atheist. And she still describes herself as an atheist. And yet, as one of these three and\n\n1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:39.760\n four people who walked away from this experiment transformed, she says that her experience of\n\n1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:45.360\n psilocybin was like being bathed in God's love from an atheist. And I asked her why she uses\n\n1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:51.360\n the word God, why not the love of the cosmos or the universe or mother nature? And she says,\n\n1:12:51.360 --> 1:12:56.880\n well, frankly, we don't know about any of this stuff and that God makes sense to me. She's still\n\n1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:03.680\n an atheist, but it's the way she describes that as kind of like the way your mother's love must\n\n1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:08.880\n have felt when you were a baby. Yeah. There's a kind of, I like the way Einstein uses God. God\n\n1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:13.360\n doesn't play dice. There's a poetry. There's a humility that you don't know what the hell is\n\n1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:19.680\n going on. There's a humor to it. I'm a huge fan, especially like more and more of just kind of\n\n1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:27.680\n having a big old laugh at the absurdity of this world and this life as represented nicely by memes\n\n1:13:27.680 --> 1:13:34.240\n on Twitter kind of thing. I mean, there's a sense in which we want to be playing with these words\n\n1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:41.600\n and not take them so seriously and being a little bit lighthearted and explore. Let me ask you about,\n\n1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:50.880\n because you mentioned NYU, what I find fascinating is how much amazing research, speaking of science,\n\n1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:58.240\n right? Studying the effects of psilocybin, studying the effects of various psychedelics, MDMA,\n\n1:13:58.240 --> 1:14:05.600\n on the human mind right now for helping people. But I'm hoping there'll be studies soon at Hopkins\n\n1:14:05.600 --> 1:14:12.400\n and elsewhere that allow people that are kind of more quote unquote creatives or regular people\n\n1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:18.160\n that don't have a particular demon they're trying to work through, a problem they're trying to work\n\n1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:25.760\n through, but more like to see what can I find if I utilize psychedelics to explore? Is there something\n\n1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:31.760\n you could say that is exciting to you, that's promising about the future? What currently is\n\n1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:36.640\n going on but also the future of psychedelics research at Hopkins and elsewhere? The healthy normals.\n\n1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:43.040\n I was looking for the right words because healthy doesn't feel like a good term and\n\n1:14:43.040 --> 1:14:47.440\n normal doesn't feel like a good term because we're all pretty messed up and we're all weird.\n\n1:14:47.440 --> 1:14:53.600\n Well, those with ontological angst in that case. Maybe there'll be a future DSM qualification.\n\n1:14:54.800 --> 1:15:00.400\n There's no doubt that things like psilocybin, MDMA are useful for things like anxiety,\n\n1:15:00.400 --> 1:15:06.720\n depression, end of life distress, PTSD, alcoholism, you name it. And it's largely because of the\n\n1:15:06.720 --> 1:15:13.120\n clinical research that MDMA and psilocybin will probably be legal in some FDA regulated way in\n\n1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:19.040\n the next five years. But again, I start the first page of my book with this question, why do\n\n1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:25.680\n psychedelics work across all these different conditions? And the best that I could find is\n\n1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:32.800\n is the meaning, right? Tony Bosse at NYU talks about psilocybin, for example, as meaning making\n\n1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:38.000\n medicine, which is interesting because it puts it somewhere between a therapeutic and again,\n\n1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:45.120\n this ontological instigator. What is it about psychedelics that creates these mystical\n\n1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:50.080\n experiences or mystical like experiences? You can call them emotional breakthroughs,\n\n1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:54.640\n you can call them moments of awe. I do think we get locked up in the language and we're\n\n1:15:54.640 --> 1:16:00.640\n somewhere between science and religion here, including legally. So the FDA is one route to\n\n1:16:00.640 --> 1:16:04.800\n this. What excites me about psychedelics is the first amendment. What is this going to mean for\n\n1:16:04.800 --> 1:16:09.600\n religion? The freedom of religion being the first thing that's mentioned in the first amendment\n\n1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:15.520\n before freedom of speech, freedom of assembly. If America is known for anything, it's a refuge\n\n1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:21.280\n for religious pioneers. And so we already have the native American church, Brazilian spawn churches\n\n1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:28.080\n that are using psychedelics. But what would happen if Judaism or Christianity or Islam were to begin\n\n1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:35.680\n incorporating the very ritual, very sacred and discreet use of psychedelics as part of their\n\n1:16:35.680 --> 1:16:42.080\n liturgy? So not replacing the Sunday Eucharist in the case of Christianity, but part of the extra\n\n1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:49.040\n credit dimension of the faith. And then we can, through practice, figure out how essential it is.\n\n1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:53.040\n It could be a minor thing. It could be a major thing. That's another thing I wanted to kind of\n\n1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:58.080\n ask you is, I recently, despite the fact that I'm eating a huge amount of meat, I'm getting fat.\n\n1:16:58.640 --> 1:17:07.200\n I'm loving it. This is actually, as of two days ago, I started this long road to training for David\n\n1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:13.680\n Goggins, to training back, to getting back to competing in jiu jitsu. So the fun is over. But\n\n1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:21.600\n I also partook in fasting and there was a very strong, there's an almost like a hallucinogenic\n\n1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:27.280\n aspect of fasting, because it was, especially because it was a 72 hour fast versus a more common\n\n1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:34.640\n fast that I do, which is 24 hours. And a bunch of people talk about throughout history about the\n\n1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:42.240\n value of fasting in having these kind of visual, these kind of intellectual experiences. Also,\n\n1:17:42.240 --> 1:17:51.200\n there's meditation, Sam Harris with the hoodie. Do you have a sense that those other rituals of\n\n1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:59.040\n fasting, of meditation, and maybe other things could be as essential or more essential to the\n\n1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:05.360\n religious experience as psychedelics? Yes, if not, and this is going to sound weird, but maybe not\n\n1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:13.200\n if more so. I look at psychedelics as a catalyst for spiritual investigation, not as the superficial\n\n1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:21.840\n means to an end. I think their value is in kind of serving as a Google Maps for the Kingdom of Heaven.\n\n1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:31.280\n All right, I like this. Well, so Ram Dass's teacher said that when he was offered psychedelics that\n\n1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:37.920\n it'll get you in the room with Jesus, but it won't keep you there. And I think that's all well and\n\n1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:41.520\n good, but what if you don't know where the house is in the first place? What if you've never had\n\n1:18:41.520 --> 1:18:47.680\n a mystical experience? What if religion is anathema to you? What if you hate God? What if all\n\n1:18:47.680 --> 1:18:51.920\n these words mean nothing to you? And they probably do for many, many people, and it's perfectly\n\n1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:57.200\n understandable. I think that we've lost the coordinates to these irrational states, again,\n\n1:18:57.200 --> 1:19:03.120\n that were prized throughout antiquity and that continue to be prized by the mystical communities,\n\n1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:08.560\n even in big organized religion, it just doesn't filter out that much. And so psychedelics, in my\n\n1:19:08.560 --> 1:19:16.720\n mind, help orient our minds, bodies, and souls towards the irrational, right? We talked about\n\n1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:23.520\n McKenna's invisible world that seems to have this symbiosis with our own and perhaps has this higher\n\n1:19:23.520 --> 1:19:30.240\n intent for us. You could very well just, you know, take catalog of your dreams, right? And that would\n\n1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:37.120\n do it too. But psychedelics seem to be particularly fast acting, particularly potent, and very\n\n1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:42.880\n reliable, especially in the clinical studies. And so I looked at them as biochemical discoveries,\n\n1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:49.920\n like Huxley did. Maybe it's once in your life or infrequently, right? But maybe that's the beginning\n\n1:19:49.920 --> 1:19:55.600\n of a genuine introspection and a life well examined, as the ancients always instructed us.\n\n1:19:55.600 --> 1:20:00.960\n Yeah, it does seem like in the research, the effectiveness of psychedelics always comes with\n\n1:20:00.960 --> 1:20:07.920\n the integration, where you use it, just like you said, as a catalyst for thinking through stuff.\n\n1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:15.920\n It's not going to be, I don't even know if Google Maps, maybe Google Maps is the right analogy,\n\n1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:22.240\n but it doesn't do the driving for you. You still have to do the driving. It just kind of gives you\n\n1:20:22.240 --> 1:20:28.400\n the directions. So after you come down from the trip, or whatever, you still have to drive.\n\n1:20:29.360 --> 1:20:34.480\n There's other tools that are kind of interesting. We've been talking about this at the psychological\n\n1:20:34.480 --> 1:20:39.440\n level, but there's also a neuroscience perspective of it. If you kind of like go past the skull into\n\n1:20:39.440 --> 1:20:43.760\n the brain with the neurons firing, there's ideas of brain computer interfaces,\n\n1:20:43.760 --> 1:20:48.160\n there's ideas of brain computer interfaces. First of all, there's a whole field of neuroscience\n\n1:20:48.160 --> 1:20:52.160\n that's kind of zooming in and studying the firing of the brain, the firing of the neurons in the\n\n1:20:52.160 --> 1:21:00.240\n brain, of how from those neurons emerges all the things that we think that makes us human. That's a\n\n1:21:00.240 --> 1:21:06.080\n fascinating exploration of the human mind. That's of course where the psychedelics have the chemical,\n\n1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:13.280\n the biochemical effects on those neurons. There's ideas of brain computer interfaces,\n\n1:21:13.280 --> 1:21:18.240\n which if you look at, especially what Neuralink is doing with this long term vision,\n\n1:21:18.880 --> 1:21:26.880\n with Elon Musk and Neuralink, they hope to expand, he calls it a wizard hat.\n\n1:21:32.160 --> 1:21:38.080\n This is back to the humor on the internet thing. The wizard hat that expands the\n\n1:21:38.080 --> 1:21:44.800\n capabilities, the capacity of the human mind. Do you think there's something there or\n\n1:21:47.840 --> 1:21:54.080\n is the human mind so infinitely complex that we're quite a long way away from\n\n1:21:55.360 --> 1:22:02.160\n expanding the capabilities of the human mind through technology versus something like psychedelics?\n\n1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:08.720\n I wonder how Terence McKenna would answer that question. He looked to shamans as kind of the\n\n1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:15.280\n scientists, the high magicians of the high archaic past and the far flung future.\n\n1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:21.120\n You know more about AI than I do, so I'm not going to discount it. But\n\n1:22:21.120 --> 1:22:31.840\n I do think that AI paired with the sacred recovery, the archaeology of consciousness\n\n1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:37.600\n and these states, these archaic techniques of ecstasy that were practiced across time. I think\n\n1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:44.400\n that's a winning combination. Part of what I do in the book is just I try and lay out the set\n\n1:22:44.400 --> 1:22:48.640\n and setting. That's often talked about with psychedelics. So maybe psychedelics in the\n\n1:22:48.640 --> 1:22:53.840\n right AI environment is going to work. I think it'd probably work a lot better with that myth\n\n1:22:53.840 --> 1:23:00.560\n and ritual incorporated. So the reason Eleusis worked for 2000 years and let's assume the\n\n1:23:00.560 --> 1:23:05.600\n psychedelic hypothesis has some merit to it. But I think the reason it worked is because you were\n\n1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:11.680\n born into a mythology. You were born into a story about Demeter and Persephone and you waited your\n\n1:23:11.680 --> 1:23:17.360\n entire life to meet them in the flesh. So you weren't just preparing for a few months. It was\n\n1:23:17.360 --> 1:23:24.560\n a lifetime of expectation, anticipation, ritual preparation. In fact, some of the early church\n\n1:23:24.560 --> 1:23:30.080\n fathers made fun of the Greeks for essentially just piquing people's curiosity and revving up\n\n1:23:30.080 --> 1:23:34.240\n the anticipation, which has something to do with the outcome, by the way. But in other words,\n\n1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:39.840\n I think we need to create a new mythology around this. I don't think you pop into a laboratory.\n\n1:23:39.840 --> 1:23:45.200\n I don't think you pop into a retreat center from one day to the next. I think that in my own case,\n\n1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:50.240\n I think that in my own case, I feel like I've been preparing 12 years for psychedelics and I'm still\n\n1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:57.120\n preparing, including in today's conversation. I'm learning new things and I'm willing to explore it\n\n1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:04.960\n together with the computer interface. But I do think ritual is a gigantic part of this. And even\n\n1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:11.040\n McKenna would say that. I'll paraphrase him by saying that if you'd met someone who didn't know\n\n1:24:11.040 --> 1:24:18.480\n where they were between the years 1995 and 2005, you would describe them as a fairly damaged person.\n\n1:24:18.480 --> 1:24:23.600\n And yet who among us knows what was happening in Western civilization between 900 and 1300,\n\n1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:28.960\n let alone 2,500 years ago. So this is in many ways the prophet of the psychedelic renaissance saying\n\n1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:34.400\n that history has lessons. And I don't think they're superficial lessons. I think it cuts to\n\n1:24:34.400 --> 1:24:42.960\n the very core of how and why Western civilization came to be born. Yeah, but that history can be\n\n1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:50.560\n loaded into AI systems. And I do love the idea of whether it's to bring computer interfaces or without\n\n1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:57.840\n intrusive, sort of without direct reading of the neurons and more sort of interactive experience\n\n1:24:57.840 --> 1:25:03.280\n with the robot that you can have an AI system that steers your psychedelic experience.\n\n1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:11.200\n That helps you sort of, when you take a heroic dose of psilocybin, for example,\n\n1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:16.880\n helps steer you, steer your mind, say just the right things. I mean, you could say that kind\n\n1:25:16.880 --> 1:25:25.200\n of thing with, it's a totally open problem, I would say. You talk about set and setting.\n\n1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:31.200\n This is the interesting thing about Johns Hopkins is you create a comfortable environment,\n\n1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:38.480\n a safe environment for allowing, then if you take a heroic, like a large dose of psilocybin,\n\n1:25:38.480 --> 1:25:43.520\n that you could trust that everything would be safe and you can really allow the exploration\n\n1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:50.320\n of your mind. But then you don't know from a psychotherapy perspective of like during that trip,\n\n1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:55.440\n what a human should say to steer that trip. Like that's a totally open set of problems.\n\n1:25:55.440 --> 1:26:00.960\n And in some sense, probably throughout history, those rituals, you figured out what are the\n\n1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:05.680\n right things to say to each other, how to collaborate. And maybe if you can turn that\n\n1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:11.120\n into an optimization problem, AI could figure that out much, much quicker.\n\n1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:15.200\n I'm with you. So, Eleusis was known for three things, the legomena, the dromena,\n\n1:26:15.200 --> 1:26:21.040\n the decnumena, the things said, the things done, the things shown. If you can pack that\n\n1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:26.320\n all into your AI interface, I'm in, Lex Friedman. I'm going to write a proposal and then try to\n\n1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:34.080\n get it through the IRB at MIT. I mean, there is a certain sense in which I definitely wanted\n\n1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:41.520\n to explore psychedelics, I mean, in my personal life, but also more rigorously as a scientist\n\n1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:52.000\n and to push that forward and especially in the AI space. And it is difficult how to do that dance\n\n1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:58.000\n when there's gray areas of legality and all those kinds of things. And we're dancing around them.\n\n1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:05.840\n And some of that is language and some of that is what we socially conceive of as drugs or not.\n\n1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:11.680\n And you're right that perhaps we can reframe it as religious experiences, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:27:11.680 --> 1:27:16.240\n I mean, it's fascinating because it feels like there's a bunch of tools before us that were\n\n1:27:16.240 --> 1:27:23.600\n used by the ancients that we're not utilizing for exploring the human mind, that we very well could\n\n1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:29.600\n be in a rigorous scientific way, in a safe way. And that's fascinating. There's this interesting\n\n1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:40.640\n period in the 20th century of LSD use that many of the people doing research on psychedelics now\n\n1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:47.360\n kind of have their roots in that history. I mentioned that Dr. Rick Doblin, he is one of those people.\n\n1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:54.880\n And there's this interesting story of a bunch of creatives that used LSD or other drugs to help them.\n\n1:27:56.320 --> 1:28:00.880\n What do you make of the idea of somebody like Ken Kesey who wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\n\n1:28:00.880 --> 1:28:11.520\n in part under the influence of LSD? What do you make of the use of psychedelics to\n\n1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:22.560\n maximize the creative potential of the human mind? Is this a crutch or is this actually\n\n1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:31.120\n an effective tool that we should explore? One person's crutch might be another's\n\n1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:40.400\n bungee cord. It depends on that mind. Think about Paul McCartney. I mean,\n\n1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:44.000\n we might not have some of the better Beatles music in the absence of LSD.\n\n1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:50.400\n And what did Sir Paul say in 1967 when he was asked about his use of LSD? He said that he\n\n1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:57.040\n recognized the dangers inherent in it, but that he did it with a very specific, very deliberate\n\n1:28:57.040 --> 1:29:03.760\n purpose in mind. He wanted to find the answer to what life is all about. And I'm not sure what Sir\n\n1:29:03.760 --> 1:29:10.400\n Paul is doing this week, but he's probably not doing LSD. Speaking back to my theory about these\n\n1:29:10.400 --> 1:29:16.960\n substances being catalyzers of spiritual introspection, it came along at a time in\n\n1:29:16.960 --> 1:29:22.080\n their life when I think they were ripe for it, especially George Harrison. I highly recommend\n\n1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:29.680\n the Martin Scorsese documentary about George Harrison. For them, I think it was exactly\n\n1:29:30.240 --> 1:29:36.320\n the way we ought to investigate it, which is, well, mind expanders. This is what psychedelics\n\n1:29:36.320 --> 1:29:42.720\n do, right? That which makes manifest the contents of the mind. In the absence of an experience like\n\n1:29:42.720 --> 1:29:48.640\n that, and it can be in a three day fast, it can be laying down in a cave, it can be in ritual\n\n1:29:48.640 --> 1:29:52.960\n chanting, it can be in a sun dance, but in the absence of that kind of experience at the right\n\n1:29:52.960 --> 1:29:58.640\n time in your life, it may otherwise be very difficult to find entrance to that kingdom of\n\n1:29:58.640 --> 1:30:03.360\n heaven, which I do think is here and now, getting right back to the very beginning. If we are\n\n1:30:03.360 --> 1:30:10.160\n actually to participate in that eternal principle, how and when? What do you think Nietzsche meant\n\n1:30:10.160 --> 1:30:16.480\n when he said that God is dead? So, there's a sense that religion is fading from society,\n\n1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:23.920\n and there's a cranky German that kind of wrote about it. What do you think he meant?\n\n1:30:23.920 --> 1:30:30.480\n He was a cranky German who knew a lot about Dionysus, by the way, which is why I like him.\n\n1:30:30.480 --> 1:30:38.000\n So, certainly there's some truth to the mortality of God. I think Gallup put out a study only a\n\n1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:43.040\n couple of months ago where church membership is now officially in the minority in the United States\n\n1:30:43.040 --> 1:30:49.920\n at 47%, according to the most recent poll. That number was closer to 70% only 20 years ago.\n\n1:30:49.920 --> 1:30:50.320\n Wow.\n\n1:30:50.320 --> 1:30:54.000\n So, we're living through something, and we're living through the unchurching\n\n1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:57.200\n of America, and it's the rise of the spiritual but not religious,\n\n1:30:59.120 --> 1:31:03.760\n the inheritor of all traditions but the slave to none. There's a rise in the unaffiliated,\n\n1:31:03.760 --> 1:31:08.400\n the nones. I think it was like one third of millennials. It's probably much higher now\n\n1:31:08.400 --> 1:31:13.040\n that don't affiliate with any religion. So, in that sense, God is absolutely dead,\n\n1:31:14.320 --> 1:31:19.200\n but maybe not the God that we were trying to define at the very beginning. So, Nietzsche\n\n1:31:19.200 --> 1:31:24.720\n also looked forward to the \u00dcbermensch, which would be a fully realized human being that,\n\n1:31:24.720 --> 1:31:32.800\n despite the death of God, did not fall into nihilism and amorality, existential despair,\n\n1:31:32.800 --> 1:31:38.160\n all that great German stuff. And there are some commentators who talk about this eternal\n\n1:31:38.160 --> 1:31:44.240\n recurrence that just maybe by incorporating some of these techniques, not necessarily doctrine and\n\n1:31:44.240 --> 1:31:49.120\n dogma, but I would say the techniques of antiquity. And again, Nietzsche writes a lot about the\n\n1:31:49.120 --> 1:31:56.000\n rationality of Dionysus having its place in society. If anything, these biochemical discoveries,\n\n1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:02.880\n I think, point us back. They point us back to Dionysus and their responsible incorporation of\n\n1:32:02.880 --> 1:32:11.440\n the irrational into our otherwise society of rational people and our kazoo history.\n\n1:32:11.440 --> 1:32:17.600\n I have a sense that there will be kind of, just kind of as you've implied, that there will be\n\n1:32:19.040 --> 1:32:24.160\n maybe the God of old is dying and there'll be a rebirth of different kind of God and it'll just\n\n1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:29.840\n keep happening throughout history. I do think there will be a time where AI will be the gods\n\n1:32:29.840 --> 1:32:36.480\n we look to, the other, the super intelligent, those kinds of things. There's a little bit of an\n\n1:32:36.480 --> 1:32:44.640\n inkling of religious longing for meaning in the way people conceive of aliens currently.\n\n1:32:46.320 --> 1:32:51.280\n I mean, I talked to a bunch of people about UFOs, the EPs and aliens. And so to me,\n\n1:32:51.280 --> 1:32:56.080\n it's very interesting for perhaps different reasons, because I'm just, I look up to the stars\n\n1:32:56.080 --> 1:33:02.960\n and it's incredibly humbling to me to think that there's trillions of intelligent alien civilizations\n\n1:33:02.960 --> 1:33:09.600\n out there, which to me seems likely, or perhaps not intelligent, perhaps just alien life. And\n\n1:33:09.600 --> 1:33:14.800\n actually, also that we don't even understand what it means to be intelligent, or do we understand\n\n1:33:14.800 --> 1:33:23.520\n what it means to be alive? The time scale, the spatial scale, which patterns of atoms can form\n\n1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:31.920\n in a way that you can call life, it just could be way weirder than we can imagine. And certainly\n\n1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:38.480\n way different than human life. Anyway, that to me is humbling. And so it's almost like the\n\n1:33:38.480 --> 1:33:44.960\n simulation, conceiving of the world as simulation, thinking of aliens to me is a useful thought experiment\n\n1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:50.000\n of like, what would aliens look like if they visited? How would we know? How would we communicate\n\n1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:57.760\n with them? How would we send signals to them? If they're already here and we don't see them,\n\n1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:03.440\n how's that possible? That seems to me actually likely that we would just be too self centered\n\n1:34:03.440 --> 1:34:11.440\n and too dumb to see them if they're already here. Anyway, so that's kind of the almost the\n\n1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:18.240\n pragmatic, the engineering, the physics sense of aliens. But there's also kind of a longing\n\n1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:24.240\n to connect with other intelligent beings out there, both the fear and the excitement of that,\n\n1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:30.560\n that has kind of a religious aspect to it that I find fascinating. And in the right context,\n\n1:34:30.560 --> 1:34:35.760\n when you remove the skepticism of government from that, it's actually a hopeful longing.\n\n1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:44.240\n Do you see this kind of interest in aliens as at all connected to your study of religion?\n\n1:34:44.240 --> 1:34:48.560\n So you're the first person to ask me about aliens in eight months. So it looks like I'm going on the\n\n1:34:48.560 --> 1:34:59.840\n record. Let's go. I'll drop some J. Allen Hynek on you. So Hynek involved in Project Blue Book\n\n1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:06.160\n famously says in 1966, when the long awaited solution to the UFO problem comes, and we're\n\n1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:11.600\n assuming that UFOs have something to do with aliens, but when the long awaited solution comes,\n\n1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:17.680\n I believe it will prove to be not merely the next small step in the march of science,\n\n1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:24.080\n but a mighty and unexpected quantum leap. In other words, I do not think that we're dealing with\n\n1:35:24.080 --> 1:35:30.320\n flesh and blood beings in nuts and bolts crafts. I think it's way, way more complicated than that.\n\n1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:36.160\n And if anything, it takes me back to the ancient world. It takes me back to this invisible college\n\n1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:42.880\n of beings of apparent higher intent. It takes me to the geniuses and the muses. So the first\n\n1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:49.920\n document in Western civilization, Homer's epics, they begin by invoking an alien. They invoke a\n\n1:35:49.920 --> 1:36:01.360\n muse. Tell me O muse about the man. So Homer isn't inventing poetry. He's channeling poetry, epic\n\n1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:09.600\n poetry from an alien intelligence. Maybe that intelligence has felt a little unrecognized in\n\n1:36:09.600 --> 1:36:16.160\n recent years. Trying to show up in human recognizable forms. The muse is trying to give\n\n1:36:16.160 --> 1:36:22.960\n a little hints of its existence. Yeah. I mean, I have a, I've been saying, I honestly sort of,\n\n1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:30.560\n I don't believe this, but I think about this, whether alien, like muse is a great example,\n\n1:36:30.560 --> 1:36:39.600\n whether aliens could be thoughts. Ideas we have are the aliens or consciousness itself\n\n1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:47.120\n is the methods by which aliens communicate with us. Like I find this very kind of liberating to\n\n1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:54.160\n expand our conception of what intelligent beings are. You would like Julian Jaynes. Julian Jaynes\n\n1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:59.760\n writes a great book, the origins of consciousness and the breakdown of the bicameral mind. It's this\n\n1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:06.320\n theory that the ancient Greek mind was very different from ours. And that when they heard\n\n1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:10.560\n the muses, they heard, or the gods and goddesses for that matter, they would hear them as voices\n\n1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:18.560\n in the head and hear it as an internal God figure offering commands, which they couldn't ignore. So\n\n1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:22.800\n were they walking schizophrenics? It might be one way to talk about it before the breakdown of the\n\n1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:28.560\n bicameral mind, but it's a provocative theory, largely untestable. But when you're reading\n\n1:37:28.560 --> 1:37:33.680\n ancient Greek and Latin for that matter, you can't read it very long without bumping up against these\n\n1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:40.800\n discarnate entities. They're everywhere. And they survived. They persist across time, which is even\n\n1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:45.760\n stranger, not just in the form of all the things my daughters like, like fairies and gnomes and\n\n1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:52.320\n elves. And McKenna loves this, the sylphs and the boulder grinders and the sprites and the gins and\n\n1:37:52.320 --> 1:37:58.560\n elementals, every society has them. It seems to be fairly universal. And they largely exist in\n\n1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:04.080\n folklore, mythology. This is what Jacques Vall\u00e9e writes about so wonderfully. We've kind of been\n\n1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:11.200\n sneaking around it, but let me ask you from everything we've been talking about, how do you\n\n1:38:11.200 --> 1:38:19.520\n think about consciousness? Is it a fun little trick that the human mind does or is it somehow\n\n1:38:19.520 --> 1:38:27.120\n fundamental to this whole thing? So this three pound lump of jelly inside our craniums,\n\n1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:34.800\n that can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space, it can contemplate the meaning of infinity,\n\n1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:40.960\n and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity, that peculiar self\n\n1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:47.040\n recursive quality that we call self awareness. So this is the hard problem, right? This is the\n\n1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:53.040\n unknowable, the unknown at least. I don't know. I have no good answer for that.\n\n1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:58.160\n Did you think it's somehow deeply fundamental to the human experience or is it just a trick? So\n\n1:38:58.160 --> 1:39:05.040\n you have like, I mean, Sam Harris has really been making me think about this. So, you know,\n\n1:39:05.040 --> 1:39:13.280\n calling free will an illusion. The interesting thing about Sam is it's not just a philosophical\n\n1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:23.280\n it's not just a philosophical little chat with him about free will. He really says he experiences\n\n1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:29.600\n the lack of free will. Like he's able to, you know, large parts of the day to feel like he\n\n1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:40.480\n has no free will. In that same way, now he thinks that consciousness is not an illusion. It is,\n\n1:39:40.480 --> 1:39:46.560\n you know, it's a real thing. But at the same, I'm more almost like, I'm almost more of like\n\n1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:51.520\n consciousness seems to be a little bit of an illusion in the sense that like, it feels like\n\n1:39:51.520 --> 1:39:57.440\n maybe this is a robotics AI perspective, but it feels like in that same way that Sam steps outside\n\n1:39:57.440 --> 1:40:04.160\n of feeling like he has an agency, feeling like he has a free will, I feel like we should be able to\n\n1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:12.720\n step outside of having a consciousness. So that, from my perspective, maybe that's a hopeful\n\n1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:17.760\n perspective for trying to engineer consciousness. But do you think consciousness is like at the core\n\n1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:26.880\n of this? Or is it just like language? Or almost like a thing we build on top of much deeper human,\n\n1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:33.600\n the things that makes us human? I don't know. I am attracted to Lanz's notion of biocentrism.\n\n1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:37.520\n I mean, it's difficult to walk away from the double slit experiment, not wondering\n\n1:40:38.320 --> 1:40:45.920\n why we seem capable of collapsing that quantum wave function. It's very, very weird, giving rise\n\n1:40:45.920 --> 1:40:51.280\n to even weirder ideas about superposition and spooky action at a distance and things that MIT\n\n1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:56.880\n guys know a lot better than me. But it seems to me fundamental. I mean, maybe consciousness is\n\n1:40:56.880 --> 1:41:02.800\n the fundamental thing. I mean, weirdly, some of these ancient incubatory practices, I talked about\n\n1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:08.240\n Peter Kingsley before. So he's not a proponent of ancient psychedelic use, but is a proponent of\n\n1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:14.880\n these ancient rites of incubation that were practiced by Pythagoras, Parmenides, Empedocles,\n\n1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:18.960\n other Presocratics. And so what were they doing? They were trying to get in touch with consciousness.\n\n1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:25.360\n They were entering into suspended states of animation in these cave like settings. Pythagoras\n\n1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:30.720\n had built one in his basement and would lie down motionless, apparently, for long periods of time.\n\n1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:36.720\n And what I think they were trying to do was tap into and trying to answer this question in their\n\n1:41:36.720 --> 1:41:41.920\n own, you could call it a scientific way, actually, less religion than science. And what they would\n\n1:41:42.480 --> 1:41:47.520\n discover or try to discover was a state of awareness that is somehow beyond life and death,\n\n1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:53.360\n beyond waking and dreaming, where you can be aware of the senses, but also in touch with another\n\n1:41:53.360 --> 1:42:00.800\n reality at the exact same time, what Kingsley calls sensation. That, I think, is definitely\n\n1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:08.960\n worth exploring. Well, and the way I hope to explore is by trying to build it. Everybody uses\n\n1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:13.280\n the tools they have. Well, no, I do also hope psychedelics can help. So how do you build that?\n\n1:42:13.280 --> 1:42:19.280\n I'm curious. That's a whole other discussion. There's a lot of things I could say here, but\n\n1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:32.800\n let me put simply is I believe that you can go a long way towards building consciousness\n\n1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:40.560\n by trying to fake consciousness. So fake it till you make it. As an engineering approach,\n\n1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:46.800\n I think will work for consciousness. You seem satisfied with that.\n\n1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:53.040\n I'm satisfied with that because I know how deeply unsatisfied others are, but just wait.\n\n1:42:55.280 --> 1:43:04.160\n So, I mean, I don't know what to. So the topic of consciousness is mostly handled by\n\n1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:12.560\n philosophers currently. And that's great. And their philosophers are wonderful and good at\n\n1:43:12.560 --> 1:43:18.240\n what they do. I'm not a philosopher. I'm an engineer. And I think the approach there is\n\n1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:29.520\n quite different. I think falling in love is different than trying to have a podcast conversation\n\n1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:38.800\n about what is love. I think the engineering effort is just fundamentally different than\n\n1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:45.360\n the philosophical effort. And I have a sense that consciousness can be engineered even before it is\n\n1:43:45.360 --> 1:43:50.480\n understood by the philosophers. So I think there's a bunch of things like that in this world that\n\n1:43:50.480 --> 1:43:55.520\n could be engineered before they're understood. I think the intelligence is one such thing.\n\n1:43:55.520 --> 1:44:01.680\n I think we'll be able to engineer super intelligent beings before we're able to understand\n\n1:44:01.680 --> 1:44:10.960\n the human mind. There's a lot of intuition to unpack there of why that is. But\n\n1:44:12.880 --> 1:44:19.680\n as it stands, that's perhaps my engineering optimism and engineering ethic under which I operate.\n\n1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:23.920\n Consciousness is easy to build, hard to understand.\n\n1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:34.160\n Okay. Are there books or movies in your life long ago or recently that had a big impact on you?\n\n1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:44.560\n Immortality Key is exceptionally well researched. The amount of books you read is I cannot even\n\n1:44:44.560 --> 1:44:53.120\n imagine. So is there something in your travels through the land of language that stuck with\n\n1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:59.680\n you that was especially impactful? I mentioned a couple of them. So I knew nothing about\n\n1:44:59.680 --> 1:45:06.160\n psychedelics before 2007. And it was in hearing about some of the first psilocybin experiments\n\n1:45:06.160 --> 1:45:11.840\n at Hopkins. And then shortly thereafter, I went down this rabbit hole. And so the first set of\n\n1:45:11.840 --> 1:45:17.680\n recommendations all kind of fit in that time period of my life, 2007, 2008. It started with\n\n1:45:17.680 --> 1:45:25.440\n Jeremy Narby, The Cosmic Serpent, DNA and the Origins of Knowledge. It was a total impulse buy\n\n1:45:25.440 --> 1:45:31.840\n at the Barnes and Noble on Sixth Avenue in New York and wound up introducing me to Supernatural\n\n1:45:31.840 --> 1:45:39.120\n by Graham Hancock. That convinced me that there was a long story to psychedelics that\n\n1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:44.560\n he tried to prove in that book and that we're still trying to prove. I mentioned\n\n1:45:44.560 --> 1:45:51.840\n the connection between ritual psychedelics and cave art. This is the neuropsychological model\n\n1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:57.040\n that was first proposed by David Lewis Williams at the University of Waterstrand, the same university\n\n1:45:57.040 --> 1:46:02.720\n where Lee Berger is, by the way, in South Africa. So these ideas are old. But what Graham did in\n\n1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:08.320\n that book is just it's well worth your time. It's well worth a few reads actually. Because it was\n\n1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:15.520\n after that that I discovered Breaking Open the Head by Daniel Pinchback and a lot of other books\n\n1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:23.120\n that just kind of blew my mind. What is Breaking Open the Head about? So it's Daniel's romp through\n\n1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:30.960\n contemporary shamanism. And it's his very well told experiences with everything from psilocybin\n\n1:46:30.960 --> 1:46:38.960\n to iboga being initiated by the Buites. And it was the first time I'd read any firsthand accounts,\n\n1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:45.040\n aside from Jeremy Narby, any firsthand accounts by a New Yorker, by the way, about the potential\n\n1:46:45.040 --> 1:46:51.520\n for these compounds that I'd been ignoring for far too long, obviously. And so that's when I\n\n1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:57.040\n started revisiting the Road to Eleusis and looking through the anthropological literature, reading\n\n1:46:57.040 --> 1:47:02.240\n everything Gordon Wasson had ever written, that Carl Ruck had written. And it sent me down a\n\n1:47:02.240 --> 1:47:06.960\n pretty weird rabbit hole until I found Peter Kingsley, which is my second recommendation.\n\n1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:14.720\n So Peter, again, he's not a fan of the psychedelic hypothesis. But what he does is I think expose\n\n1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:20.000\n the value of the irrational to the ancient Greeks, especially the pre Socratic. Here we are talking\n\n1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:29.280\n about AI and God and these entangled philosophical questions. The best I can read Kingsley is that\n\n1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:36.160\n Western civilization is a product of a gift from the goddess Persephone. And this is not a hippie.\n\n1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:43.040\n This is a pretty gold standard classicist who went on to write a couple of books. One is In\n\n1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:48.240\n the Dark Places of Wisdom, and the other is Reality. What better way to title your book?\n\n1:47:48.240 --> 1:47:54.320\n Where he talks about these ancient techniques for exploring the irrational. The same thing Carl Ruck\n\n1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:59.840\n was talking about. After compiling all this data in the Road to Eleusis, Ruck says that the biggest\n\n1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:05.280\n challenge is trying to convince his colleagues in the late 1970s that the ancient Greeks,\n\n1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:12.480\n and indeed some of the most famous and intelligent among them, could enter so fully into irrationality.\n\n1:48:12.480 --> 1:48:16.720\n Same thing Nietzsche is talking about in his exploration of Dionysus. And so I think\n\n1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:24.080\n Kingsley just stands apart as one of those books, Reality, that my life was never quite the same\n\n1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:28.320\n after reading that. We talked about the three pound\n\n1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:40.480\n jelly that is able to conceive of the entirety of the fabric of reality in the universe\n\n1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:49.280\n and everything, and also of its own mortality. What do you think is the meaning of it all?\n\n1:48:50.880 --> 1:48:58.160\n What's the meaning of life? Is a three pound jelly able to answer that one?\n\n1:48:59.680 --> 1:49:06.640\n No, but I can plagiarize Joseph Campbell, which is good enough. Joe Campbell says that I don't\n\n1:49:06.640 --> 1:49:12.480\n think what we're looking for is a meaning of life. I think what we're looking for is an experience\n\n1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:19.120\n of being alive so that the experiences we have on the purely physical plane will have resonances\n\n1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:23.840\n within that are those of our innermost being and reality. You talked about the true reality,\n\n1:49:23.840 --> 1:49:31.360\n absolute truth. These are all constructs. And I think they're constructs that are made day by day\n\n1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:37.200\n and acquire this aura of factuality, remembering Clifford Geertz's definition of religion. We're\n\n1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:42.880\n all just faking it until we make it. And I think a lot of that has to do with moods and motivations\n\n1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:48.640\n and feelings and emotions, which is not to discredit facts and figures. But I think that\n\n1:49:48.640 --> 1:49:56.000\n meaning, meaning making is a very subjective process that is not only difficult to talk about,\n\n1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:02.160\n but difficult to quantify. And experience is a primary in that versus, so like the actual\n\n1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:09.520\n subjective experience is primary to the meaning making process versus like some kind of rigorous\n\n1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:17.840\n analysis of like having an algorithm that runs and computes and then finally spits out 42.\n\n1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:24.320\n Well, this is how families are created. Tell me more about this. Well, my wife and I fell in love\n\n1:50:24.320 --> 1:50:29.360\n and made babies. We didn't type up an Excel sheet and figure out the best way to go about this.\n\n1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:32.880\n That's what I've been doing all these years. That's why I'm single.\n\n1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:41.920\n Too many Excel sheets. Well, we say falling in love, right? We say fall in love. What does that\n\n1:50:41.920 --> 1:50:50.080\n mean to fall in love? You are surrendering to an intelligence that is beyond us. You could say a\n\n1:50:50.080 --> 1:50:54.880\n Godlike intelligence. Richard Rohr, the Franciscan friar I mentioned, in the Universal Christ,\n\n1:50:54.880 --> 1:51:02.000\n he writes a lot about how the divine for you is often encountered in the other. In fact,\n\n1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:07.760\n how could it be otherwise? This is bedrock sacramental theology that you find the God in\n\n1:51:07.760 --> 1:51:14.800\n the things in your life as well you should. That's the proving ground for identifying as God rather\n\n1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:19.600\n than creating a relationship with God. And so I think that these irrational states play a big role\n\n1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:24.960\n in that. Irrational. Well, I don't think there's a better way to end it than on the topic of love.\n\n1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:31.600\n Brian, thank you so much for a brilliant exposition of history and the poetry.\n\n1:51:32.320 --> 1:51:37.520\n I really appreciate you talking with me today. I love you, Lex. I love you too, Brian.\n\n1:51:39.120 --> 1:51:44.320\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Brian Muirrescu. And thank you to Inside Tracker,\n\n1:51:44.320 --> 1:51:51.120\n GiveWell, Ni, Indeed, and Masterclass. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:56.480\n And now, let me leave you with some words from Terrence McKenna about psychedelics.\n\n1:51:57.760 --> 1:52:04.080\n Part of what psychedelics do is they decondition you from cultural values. This is what makes it\n\n1:52:04.080 --> 1:52:09.440\n such a political hot potato. Since all culture is a kind of con game, the most dangerous candy\n\n1:52:09.440 --> 1:52:14.800\n you can hand out is one which causes people to start questioning the rules of the game.\n\n1:52:14.800 --> 1:52:38.800\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
