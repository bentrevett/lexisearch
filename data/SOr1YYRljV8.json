00:07.240\n and thinkers in the world.\n\n00:07.240 --> 00:11.680\n Objectivism is the philosophical system developed by Ayn Rand\n\n00:11.680 --> 00:14.240\n that she first expressed in her fiction books,\n\n00:14.240 --> 00:16.720\n The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged,\n\n00:16.720 --> 00:19.840\n and later in nonfiction essays and books.\n\n00:19.840 --> 00:22.880\n Yaron is the current chairman of the board\n\n00:22.880 --> 00:26.800\n at the Ayn Rand Institute, host of the Yaron Brook Show,\n\n00:26.800 --> 00:30.080\n and the coauthor of Free Market Revolution,\n\n00:30.080 --> 00:33.360\n Equal is Unfair, and several other books\n\n00:33.360 --> 00:37.440\n where he analyzes systems of government, human behavior,\n\n00:37.440 --> 00:41.800\n and the human condition from the perspective of objectivism.\n\n00:41.800 --> 00:43.320\n Quick mention of each sponsor,\n\n00:43.320 --> 00:46.280\n followed by some thoughts related to the episode.\n\n00:46.280 --> 00:49.120\n Blinkist, an app I use for reading\n\n00:49.120 --> 00:51.080\n through summaries of books.\n\n00:51.080 --> 00:54.640\n ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years\n\n00:54.640 --> 00:57.240\n to protect my privacy on the internet.\n\n00:57.240 --> 01:01.400\n And CashApp, the app I use to send money to friends.\n\n01:01.400 --> 01:03.640\n Please check out these sponsors in the description\n\n01:03.640 --> 01:07.320\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n01:07.320 --> 01:11.040\n As a side note, let me say that I first read Atlas Shrugged\n\n01:11.040 --> 01:13.480\n and The Fountainhead early in college,\n\n01:13.480 --> 01:16.960\n along with many other literary and philosophical works\n\n01:16.960 --> 01:21.280\n from Nietzsche, Heidegger, Kant, Locke, Foucault,\n\n01:21.280 --> 01:25.120\n Wittgenstein, and of course, all the great existentialists\n\n01:25.120 --> 01:27.640\n from Kierkegaard to Camus.\n\n01:27.640 --> 01:30.160\n I always had an open mind, curious to learn\n\n01:30.160 --> 01:33.040\n and explore the ideas of thinkers throughout history,\n\n01:33.040 --> 01:36.720\n no matter how mundane or radical\n\n01:36.720 --> 01:39.480\n or even dangerous they were considered to be.\n\n01:40.360 --> 01:44.480\n Ayn Rand was, and I think still is, a divisive figure.\n\n01:44.480 --> 01:46.880\n Some people love her, some people dislike\n\n01:46.880 --> 01:49.200\n or even dismiss her.\n\n01:49.200 --> 01:51.400\n I prefer to look past what some may consider\n\n01:51.400 --> 01:53.720\n to be the flaws of the person\n\n01:53.720 --> 01:57.880\n and consider with an open mind the ideas she presents\n\n01:57.880 --> 02:00.720\n and Jaron now describes and applies\n\n02:00.720 --> 02:02.920\n in his philosophical discussions.\n\n02:02.920 --> 02:05.400\n In general, I hope that you will be patient\n\n02:05.400 --> 02:09.760\n and understanding as I venture out across the space of ideas\n\n02:09.760 --> 02:12.720\n and the ever widening Overton window,\n\n02:12.720 --> 02:15.040\n pulling at the thread of curiosity,\n\n02:15.040 --> 02:17.080\n sometimes saying stupid things,\n\n02:17.080 --> 02:19.200\n but always striving to understand\n\n02:19.200 --> 02:23.280\n how we can better build a better world together.\n\n02:23.280 --> 02:25.680\n If you enjoy this

question first.\n\n02:42.560 --> 02:43.400\n Sure.\n\n02:43.400 --> 02:47.280\n What are the principles of a life well lived?\n\n02:47.280 --> 02:50.120\n I think it's to live with thought,\n\n02:51.920 --> 02:55.920\n that is to live a rational life, to think it through.\n\n02:55.920 --> 02:59.600\n I think so many people are in a sense zombies out there.\n\n02:59.600 --> 03:01.880\n They're alive, but they're not really alive\n\n03:01.880 --> 03:03.920\n because their mind is not focused,\n\n03:03.920 --> 03:07.960\n their mind is not focused on what do I need to do\n\n03:07.960 --> 03:10.000\n in order to live a great life?\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:12.880\n So too many people just go through the motions\n\n03:12.880 --> 03:16.720\n of living rather than really embrace life.\n\n03:16.720 --> 03:19.720\n So I think the secret to living a great life\n\n03:19.720 --> 03:22.680\n is to take it seriously.\n\n03:22.680 --> 03:24.440\n And what it means to take it seriously\n\n03:24.440 --> 03:26.960\n is to use the one tool that makes us human,\n\n03:26.960 --> 03:29.040\n the one tool that provides us with all the values\n\n03:29.040 --> 03:31.640\n that we have, our mind, our reason,\n\n03:31.640 --> 03:34.840\n and to use it, apply it to living.\n\n03:34.840 --> 03:36.720\n People apply it to their work,\n\n03:36.720 --> 03:38.840\n they apply it to their math problems,\n\n03:38.840 --> 03:41.880\n to science, to programming.\n\n03:41.880 --> 03:43.640\n But imagine if they used that same energy,\n\n03:43.640 --> 03:45.600\n that same focus, that same concentration\n\n03:45.600 --> 03:48.680\n to actually living life and choosing values\n\n03:49.560 --> 03:51.040\n that they should pursue,\n\n03:51.880 --> 03:54.240\n that would change the world,\n\n03:54.240 --> 03:56.160\n and it would change their lives.\n\n03:56.160 --> 04:00.280\n Yeah, actually, I wear this silly suit and tie.\n\n04:00.280 --> 04:02.240\n It symbolizes to me always,\n\n04:02.240 --> 04:06.400\n it makes me feel like I'm taking the moment really seriously.\n\n04:06.400 --> 04:08.440\n I think that's really, that's right.\n\n04:08.440 --> 04:10.920\n And each one of us has different ways\n\n04:10.920 --> 04:14.400\n to kind of condition our consciousness.\n\n04:14.400 --> 04:17.720\n I'm serious now, and for you, it's a suit and tie.\n\n04:17.720 --> 04:19.560\n It's a conditioning of your consciousness\n\n04:19.560 --> 04:21.520\n to now I'm focused, now I'm at work,\n\n04:21.520 --> 04:22.840\n now I'm doing my thing.\n\n04:22.840 --> 04:23.840\n Yeah.\n\n04:23.840 --> 04:26.000\n And I think that's terrific,\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:28.000\n and I wish everybody took that.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:32.040\n Look, I mean, it's a cliche, but we only live once.\n\n04:32.040 --> 04:34.800\n Every minute of your life, you're never gonna live again.\n\n04:34.800 --> 04:36.480\n This is really valuable.\n\n04:36.480 --> 04:41.000\n And when people don't have that deep respect\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:44.800\n for their own life, for their own time, for their own mind,\n\n04:44.800 --> 04:49.120\n and if they did, again, one could only imagine,\n\n04:49.120 --> 04:50.840\n look at how productive people are.\n\n04:50.840 --> 04:52.560\n Look at the amazing things they produce\n\n04:52.560 --> 04:54.520\n and they do in their work.\n\n04:54.520 --> 04:58.480\n And if they applied that to everything, wow.\n\n04:58.480 --> 05:00.240\n So you kind of talk about reason.\n\n05:00.240 --> 05:05.120\n Where does the kind of existentialist idea\n\n05:05.120 --> 05:10.120\n of experience maybe, fully experiencing all the moments\n\n05:10.560 --> 05:13.720\n versus fully thinking through?\n\n05:14.640 --> 05:17.760\n Is there an interesting line to separate the two?\n\n05:17.760 --> 05:21.800\n Why such an emphasis on reason for a life well lived\n\n05:21.800 --> 05:26.480\n versus just enjoy, like experience the moment?\n\n05:26.480 --> 05:28.360\n Well, because I think experience in a sense\n\n05:28.360 --> 05:31.480\n is the easy part.\n\n05:31.480 --> 05:36.480\n I'm not saying it's how we experience the life that we live.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:42.000\n And yes, I'm all with the take time to value what you value,\n\n05:43.240 --> 05:46.680\n but I don't think that's the problem of people out there.\n\n05:46.680 --> 05:48.640\n I don't think the problem is they're not taking time\n\n05:48.640 --> 05:51.080\n to appreciate where they are and what they do.\n\n05:51.080 --> 05:53.360\n I think it's that they don't use their mind\n\n05:53.360 --> 05:57.800\n in this one respect, in planning their life,\n\n05:57.800 --> 06:00.080\n in thinking about how to live.\n\n06:00.080 --> 06:02.360\n So the focus is on reason is because\n\n06:02.360 --> 06:03.880\n it's our only source of knowledge.\n\n06:03.880 --> 06:05.240\n There's no other source of knowledge.\n\n06:05.240 --> 06:10.080\n We don't know anything that does not come\n\n06:10.080 --> 06:12.480\n from our senses and our mind,\n\n06:12.480 --> 06:15.200\n the integration of the evidence of our senses.\n\n06:15.200 --> 06:16.680\n Now we know stuff about ourselves\n\n06:16.680 --> 06:18.280\n and I think it's important to know oneself\n\n06:18.280 --> 06:19.720\n through introspection.\n\n06:19.720 --> 06:24.720\n And I consider that part of reasoning is to introspect.\n\n06:25.640 --> 06:29.840\n But I think reason is undervalued, which is funny to say,\n\n06:29.840 --> 06:31.360\n because it's our means of survival.\n\n06:31.360 --> 06:33.000\n It's how human beings survive.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.720\n We cannot, see, this is why I disagree\n\n06:35.720 --> 06:38.600\n with so many scientists and people like Sam Harris.\n\n06:38.600 --> 06:40.560\n You mentioned Sam Harris before the show.\n\n06:42.440 --> 06:46.120\n We're not programmed to know how to hunt.\n\n06:47.080 --> 06:49.040\n We're not programmed to do agriculture.\n\n06:49.040 --> 06:51.640\n We're not programmed to build computers\n\n06:51.640 --> 06:53.880\n and build networks on which we can podcast\n\n06:53.880 --> 06:55.320\n and do our shows.\n\n06:55.320 --> 06:58.080\n All of that requires effort.\n\n06:58.080 --> 06:59.720\n It requires focus.\n\n06:59.720 --> 07:03.360\n It requires energy and it requires will.\n\n07:03.360 --> 07:05.840\n It requires somebody to will it.\n\n07:05.840 --> 07:08.560\n It requires somebody to choose it.\n\n07:08.560 --> 07:11.200\n And once you make that choice,\n\n07:11.200 --> 07:13.560\n you have to engage that choice means\n\n07:13.560 --> 07:15.960\n that you're choosing to engage your reason\n\n07:15.960 --> 07:19.240\n in discovery, in integration,\n\n07:19.240 --> 07:23.120\n and then in work to change the world in which we live.\n\n07:23.120 --> 07:26.400\n And human beings have to discover,\n\n07:26.400 --> 07:29.120\n figure out, solve the problem of hunting.\n\n07:29.120 --> 07:31.640\n Hunting, everybody thinks, oh, that's easy.\n\n07:31.640 --> 07:32.680\n I've seen the movie.\n\n07:32.680 --> 07:36.280\n But human beings had to figure out how to do it, right?\n\n07:36.280 --> 07:40.760\n You can't run down a bison and bite into it, right?\n\n07:40.760 --> 07:41.600\n You're not gonna catch it.\n\n07:41.600 --> 07:44.120\n You're not gonna, you have no fangs to bite into it.\n\n07:44.120 --> 07:45.560\n You have to build weapons.\n\n07:45.560 --> 07:46.440\n You have to build tools.\n\n07:46.440 --> 07:47.680\n You have to create traps.\n\n07:47.680 --> 07:49.520\n You have to have a strategy.\n\n07:49.520 --> 07:50.920\n All of that requires reason.\n\n07:52.040 --> 07:56.520\n So the most important thing that allows human beings\n\n07:56.520 --> 07:58.800\n to survive and to thrive in every value\n\n07:58.800 --> 08:01.400\n from the most simple to the most sophisticated,\n\n08:01.400 --> 08:04.600\n from the most material to, I believe, the most spiritual,\n\n08:04.600 --> 08:06.320\n requires thinking.\n\n08:06.320 --> 08:10.240\n So stopping and appreciating the moment\n\n08:10.240 --> 08:14.480\n is something that I think is relatively easy\n\n08:14.480 --> 08:17.600\n once you have a plan, once you've thought it through,\n\n08:17.600 --> 08:19.640\n once you know what your values are.\n\n08:20.600 --> 08:21.920\n There is a mistake people make.\n\n08:21.920 --> 08:25.720\n They attain their values and they don't take a moment\n\n08:25.720 --> 08:27.800\n to savor that and to appreciate that\n\n08:27.800 --> 08:31.360\n and to even pat themselves on the back that they did it.\n\n08:31.360 --> 08:33.200\n But that's not what's screwing up the world.\n\n08:33.200 --> 08:34.320\n What's screwing up the world\n\n08:34.320 --> 08:35.800\n is that people have the wrong values\n\n08:35.800 --> 08:37.320\n and they don't think about them\n\n08:37.320 --> 08:39.000\n and they don't really focus on them\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.520\n and they don't have a plan for their own life\n\n08:41.520 --> 08:42.600\n and how to live it.\n\n08:42.600 --> 08:44.320\n If we look at human nature,\n\n08:44.320 --> 08:46.760\n you're saying the fundamental big thing\n\n08:46.760 --> 08:49.080\n that we need to consider is our capacity,\n\n08:49.080 --> 08:51.600\n like a capability to reason.\n\n08:51.600 --> 08:56.600\n So to me, reason is this massive evolutionary achievement\n\n08:56.600 --> 08:57.440\n in quotes.\n\n08:58.960 --> 09:02.280\n If you think about any other sophisticated animal,\n\n09:02.280 --> 09:03.840\n everything has to be coded.\n\n09:04.800 --> 09:07.280\n Everything has to be written in the hard way.\n\n09:07.280 --> 09:08.800\n It has to be there.\n\n09:08.800 --> 09:11.080\n And they have to have a solution for every outcome.\n\n09:11.080 --> 09:13.280\n And if there's no solution, the animal dies typically,\n\n09:13.280 --> 09:15.680\n or the animal suffers in some way.\n\n09:15.680 --> 09:18.560\n Human beings have this capacity to self program.\n\n09:18.560 --> 09:20.280\n They have this capacity.\n\n09:20.280 --> 09:24.320\n It's not a tabula rasa in the sense\n\n09:24.320 --> 09:25.280\n that there's nothing there.\n\n09:25.280 --> 09:26.880\n Obviously, we have a nature.\n\n09:26.880 --> 09:29.200\n Obviously, our minds, our brains\n\n09:29.200 --> 09:31.160\n are structured in a particular way.\n\n09:31.160 --> 09:35.120\n But given that, we have the ability\n\n09:35.120 --> 09:37.320\n to turn it on or turn it off.\n\n09:37.320 --> 09:39.440\n We have the ability to commit suicide,\n\n09:39.440 --> 09:43.600\n to reject our nature, to work against our interests,\n\n09:43.600 --> 09:48.120\n not to use the tool that evolution has provided us,\n\n09:48.120 --> 09:50.760\n which is this mind, which is reason.\n\n09:50.760 --> 09:54.280\n So that choice, that fundamental choice,\n\n09:54.280 --> 09:58.440\n you know, Hamlet says it, right, to be or not to be.\n\n09:58.440 --> 10:01.880\n But to be or not to be is to think or not to think,\n\n10:01.880 --> 10:05.880\n to engage or not to engage, to focus or not to focus.\n\n10:05.880 --> 10:07.720\n You know, in the morning when you get up,\n\n10:07.720 --> 10:10.560\n you kind of, you know, you're not really completely there.\n\n10:10.560 --> 10:12.680\n You're kind of out of focus and stuff.\n\n10:12.680 --> 10:14.880\n It requires an act of will to say,\n\n10:14.880 --> 10:17.520\n okay, I'm awake, I've got stuff to do.\n\n10:17.520 --> 10:19.280\n Some people never do that.\n\n10:19.280 --> 10:21.600\n Some people live in that haze,\n\n10:21.600 --> 10:23.440\n and they never engage that mind.\n\n10:23.440 --> 10:26.200\n And when you're sitting and try to solve\n\n10:26.200 --> 10:29.400\n a complex computer problem or math problem,\n\n10:29.400 --> 10:31.920\n you have to turn something on.\n\n10:31.920 --> 10:36.160\n You have to, in a sense, exert certain energy\n\n10:36.160 --> 10:38.080\n to focus on the problem to do it.\n\n10:38.080 --> 10:41.160\n And that is not determined in a sense\n\n10:41.160 --> 10:43.160\n that you have to focus.\n\n10:43.160 --> 10:46.200\n You choose to focus, and you could choose not to focus.\n\n10:46.200 --> 10:49.360\n And that choice is more powerful than any other,\n\n10:49.360 --> 10:52.160\n like, parts of our brain that we've borrowed from fish\n\n10:52.160 --> 10:54.640\n and from our evolutionary origins.\n\n10:54.640 --> 10:58.040\n Like this, whatever this crazy little leap in evolution is\n\n10:58.040 --> 11:00.640\n that allowed us to think is more powerful than anything else.\n\n11:00.640 --> 11:05.560\n So I think neuroscientists pretend they know a lot more\n\n11:05.560 --> 11:07.440\n about the brain than they really do.\n\n11:07.440 --> 11:09.080\n Yeah.\n\n11:09.080 --> 11:11.720\n And that we know. Shots fired.\n\n11:11.720 --> 11:12.560\n I agree with you.\n\n11:12.560 --> 11:14.760\n And we don't know that much yet\n\n11:14.760 --> 11:16.960\n about how the brain functions and what's a fish\n\n11:16.960 --> 11:18.760\n and what, you know, all this stuff.\n\n11:18.760 --> 11:21.400\n So I think what exists there\n\n11:21.400 --> 11:24.880\n is a lot of potentialities.\n\n11:24.880 --> 11:28.720\n But the beauty of the human brain is it's potentialities\n\n11:28.720 --> 11:32.880\n that we have to manifest through our choices.\n\n11:32.880 --> 11:34.440\n It's there. It's sitting there.\n\n11:34.440 --> 11:36.280\n And, yes, there's certain things\n\n11:36.280 --> 11:42.640\n that are going to evoke certain senses, certain feelings.\n\n11:42.640 --> 11:43.760\n I'm not even saying emotions\n\n11:43.760 --> 11:45.320\n because I think emotions are too complex\n\n11:45.320 --> 11:48.120\n to have been programmed into our mind.\n\n11:48.120 --> 11:49.480\n But I don't think so.\n\n11:49.480 --> 11:52.000\n You know, there's this big issue of evolutionary psychology\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:55.760\n is huge right now and it's a big issue.\n\n11:55.760 --> 12:02.760\n You know, I find it to a large extent as way too early\n\n12:02.760 --> 12:08.000\n and in storytelling about expo storytelling about stuff.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.360\n We still don't, you know, so for example,\n\n12:10.360 --> 12:12.240\n I would like to see if evolutionary psychology\n\n12:12.240 --> 12:17.000\n differentiate between things like inclinations,\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:23.600\n feelings, emotions, sensations, thoughts, concepts, ideas.\n\n12:23.600 --> 12:27.080\n What of those are programmed and what of those are developed\n\n12:27.080 --> 12:29.520\n and chosen and a product of reason?\n\n12:29.520 --> 12:33.920\n I think anything from emotion to abstract ideas is all chosen,\n\n12:33.920 --> 12:36.720\n is all a product of reason.\n\n12:36.720 --> 12:42.440\n And everything before that, we might have been programmed for.\n\n12:42.440 --> 12:45.880\n But the fact is so clearly a sensation is not a product of,\n\n12:45.880 --> 12:48.680\n you know, is something that we feel\n\n12:48.680 --> 12:50.720\n because that's how our biology works.\n\n12:50.720 --> 12:54.240\n So until we have these categories\n\n12:54.240 --> 12:58.720\n and until we can clearly specify what is what\n\n12:58.720 --> 13:01.320\n and where do they come from,\n\n13:01.320 --> 13:03.200\n the whole discussion in evolutionary psychology\n\n13:03.200 --> 13:04.320\n seems to be rambling.\n\n13:04.320 --> 13:06.400\n It doesn't seem to be scientific.\n\n13:06.400 --> 13:08.840\n So we have to define our terms, you know,\n\n13:08.840 --> 13:10.000\n which is the basis of science.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.080\n You have to have some clear definitions\n\n13:12.080 --> 13:14.760\n about what we're talking about.\n\n13:14.760 --> 13:16.360\n When you ask them these questions,\n\n13:16.360 --> 13:18.520\n there's never really a coherent answer\n\n13:18.520 --> 13:20.440\n about what is it exactly.\n\n13:20.440 --> 13:22.760\n And everybody is afraid of the issue of free will.\n\n13:22.760 --> 13:26.800\n And I think to some extent, I mean, Harris has this,\n\n13:26.800 --> 13:28.720\n and I don't want to misrepresent anything Harris has\n\n13:28.720 --> 13:33.160\n because, you know, I'm a fan and I like a lot of his stuff.\n\n13:33.160 --> 13:37.200\n But on the one hand, he is obviously intellectually active\n\n13:37.200 --> 13:38.760\n and wants to change our minds.\n\n13:38.760 --> 13:41.920\n So he believes that we have some capacity to choose.\n\n13:41.920 --> 13:44.360\n On the other hand, he's undermining that capacity\n\n13:44.360 --> 13:45.800\n to choose by saying it's just determines\n\n13:45.800 --> 13:47.360\n you're gonna choose what you choose.\n\n13:47.360 --> 13:50.240\n You have no say in it, there's actually no you.\n\n13:51.640 --> 13:55.880\n So it's, you know, and that's to me completely unscientific.\n\n13:55.880 --> 14:00.480\n That's completely him, you know, pulling it out of nowhere.\n\n14:00.480 --> 14:03.640\n We all experienced the fact that we have an eye.\n\n14:03.640 --> 14:06.720\n That kind of certainty saying that we do not have\n\n14:06.720 --> 14:09.320\n that fundamental choice that reason provides\n\n14:09.320 --> 14:12.000\n is unfounded currently.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:15.840\n Look, there's a sense in which it can never be contradicted\n\n14:15.840 --> 14:20.840\n because it's a product of your experience.\n\n14:20.840 --> 14:21.920\n It's not a product of your experience.\n\n14:21.920 --> 14:24.080\n You can experience it directly.\n\n14:24.080 --> 14:28.240\n So no science will ever prove that this table isn't here.\n\n14:29.120 --> 14:31.160\n I can see it, it's here, right?\n\n14:31.160 --> 14:32.200\n I can feel it.\n\n14:33.360 --> 14:36.400\n I know I have free will because I can introspect it.\n\n14:36.400 --> 14:37.960\n In a sense, I can see it.\n\n14:37.960 --> 14:42.960\n I can see myself engaging it and that is as valid\n\n14:45.640 --> 14:47.520\n as the evidence of my senses.\n\n14:47.520 --> 14:49.720\n Now I can't point at it so that you can see\n\n14:49.720 --> 14:51.400\n the same thing I'm seeing,\n\n14:51.400 --> 14:53.560\n but you can do the same thing in your own consciousness\n\n14:53.560 --> 14:55.200\n and you can identify the same thing.\n\n14:55.200 --> 14:59.160\n And to deny that in the name of science\n\n14:59.160 --> 15:00.560\n is to get things upside down.\n\n15:00.560 --> 15:04.720\n You start with that and that's the beginning of science.\n\n15:04.720 --> 15:07.320\n The beginning of science is the identification\n\n15:07.320 --> 15:10.720\n that I choose and that I can reason\n\n15:10.720 --> 15:13.320\n and now I need to figure out the mechanism,\n\n15:13.320 --> 15:16.720\n the rules of reasoning, the rules of logic.\n\n15:16.720 --> 15:17.680\n How does this work?\n\n15:17.680 --> 15:19.560\n And that's where science comes from.\n\n15:19.560 --> 15:21.200\n Of course, it's possible that science,\n\n15:21.200 --> 15:24.640\n like from my place of AI would be able to,\n\n15:25.680 --> 15:30.680\n if we were able to engineer consciousness or understand,\n\n15:30.960 --> 15:32.120\n I mean, it's very difficult\n\n15:32.120 --> 15:33.440\n because we're so far away from it now,\n\n15:33.440 --> 15:36.760\n but understand how the actual mechanism\n\n15:36.760 --> 15:38.600\n that consciousness emerges.\n\n15:38.600 --> 15:40.600\n And in fact, this table is not real,\n\n15:40.600 --> 15:43.560\n that we can determine that it,\n\n15:45.040 --> 15:47.480\n exactly how our mind constructs the reality\n\n15:47.480 --> 15:51.640\n that we perceive, then you can start to make interesting.\n\n15:51.640 --> 15:54.480\n But our mind doesn't construct the reality that we perceive.\n\n15:54.480 --> 15:56.320\n The reality we perceive is there.\n\n15:56.320 --> 15:59.800\n We perceive a reality that exists.\n\n15:59.800 --> 16:02.160\n Now, we perceive it in particular ways\n\n16:02.160 --> 16:05.040\n given the nature of our senses, right?\n\n16:05.040 --> 16:07.200\n A bat perceives this table differently,\n\n16:07.200 --> 16:08.520\n but it's still the same table\n\n16:08.520 --> 16:12.880\n with the same characteristics and the same identity.\n\n16:12.880 --> 16:16.160\n It's just a matter of, we use eyes,\n\n16:16.160 --> 16:18.040\n they use a radar system to,\n\n16:18.040 --> 16:19.880\n they use sound waves to perceive it,\n\n16:19.880 --> 16:20.840\n but it's still there.\n\n16:20.840 --> 16:22.960\n Existence exists whether we exist or not.\n\n16:22.960 --> 16:27.040\n And so you could create, I mean, I don't know how,\n\n16:27.040 --> 16:28.480\n and I don't know if it's possible,\n\n16:28.480 --> 16:31.000\n but let's say you could create a consciousness, right?\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.600\n And I suspect that to do that,\n\n16:33.600 --> 16:37.080\n you would have to use biology, not just electronics,\n\n16:37.080 --> 16:39.320\n but way outside my expertise.\n\n16:40.600 --> 16:42.640\n Because consciousness, as far as we know,\n\n16:42.640 --> 16:43.640\n is a phenomenon of life,\n\n16:43.640 --> 16:45.360\n and you would have to figure out how to create life\n\n16:45.360 --> 16:48.360\n before you created consciousness, I think.\n\n16:48.360 --> 16:51.880\n But if you did that, then that wouldn't change anything.\n\n16:51.880 --> 16:53.680\n All it would say is we have another conscious being.\n\n16:53.680 --> 16:54.720\n Cool, that's great.\n\n16:54.720 --> 16:58.080\n But it wouldn't change the nature of our consciousness.\n\n16:58.080 --> 17:01.360\n Our consciousness is what it is in respect.\n\n17:01.360 --> 17:04.560\n So that's very interesting, I think this is a good way\n\n17:04.560 --> 17:08.240\n to set the table for discussion of objectivism is,\n\n17:09.480 --> 17:12.360\n let me at least challenge a thought experiment,\n\n17:12.360 --> 17:14.200\n which is, I don't know if you're familiar\n\n17:14.200 --> 17:17.280\n with Donald Hoffman's work about reality.\n\n17:17.280 --> 17:20.480\n So his idea is that we're just,\n\n17:20.480 --> 17:23.440\n our perception is just an interface to reality.\n\n17:23.440 --> 17:26.560\n So Donald Hoffman is the guy you see on Vine?\n\n17:26.560 --> 17:27.400\n Yeah.\n\n17:27.400 --> 17:28.840\n Yes, I've met Donald and I've seen his video.\n\n17:28.840 --> 17:31.840\n And look, Donald has not invented anything new.\n\n17:31.840 --> 17:34.040\n This goes back to ancient philosophy.\n\n17:34.040 --> 17:38.200\n Let me just state it in case people aren't familiar.\n\n17:38.200 --> 17:41.480\n I mean, it's a fascinating thought experiment to me,\n\n17:41.480 --> 17:44.120\n like of out of the box thinking, perhaps literally,\n\n17:44.120 --> 17:49.120\n is that there's a gap between the world as we perceive it\n\n17:50.480 --> 17:52.800\n and the world as it actually exists.\n\n17:52.800 --> 17:55.040\n And I think that's, for the philosophy,\n\n17:55.040 --> 17:59.720\n objectivism is a really important gap to close.\n\n17:59.720 --> 18:03.640\n So can you maybe at least try to entertain the idea\n\n18:03.640 --> 18:08.640\n that there is more to reality than our minds can perceive?\n\n18:09.360 --> 18:13.400\n Well, I don't understand what more means, right?\n\n18:13.400 --> 18:14.800\n Of course there's more to reality\n\n18:14.800 --> 18:16.440\n than what our senses perceive.\n\n18:16.440 --> 18:19.320\n That is, for example, I don't know,\n\n18:19.320 --> 18:24.200\n certain elements have radiation, right?\n\n18:24.200 --> 18:25.160\n Uranium has radiation.\n\n18:25.160 --> 18:27.120\n I can't perceive radiation.\n\n18:27.120 --> 18:31.200\n The beauty of human reason is I can,\n\n18:31.200 --> 18:32.440\n through experimentation,\n\n18:32.440 --> 18:34.320\n discover the phenomena of radiation,\n\n18:34.320 --> 18:36.760\n then actually measure radiation.\n\n18:36.760 --> 18:37.640\n And I don't worry about it.\n\n18:37.640 --> 18:39.040\n I can't perceive the world\n\n18:39.040 --> 18:40.400\n the way a bat perceives the world.\n\n18:40.400 --> 18:43.160\n And I might not be able to see certain things,\n\n18:43.160 --> 18:44.960\n but I can, we've created radar,\n\n18:44.960 --> 18:47.800\n so A, we understand how a bat perceives the world,\n\n18:47.800 --> 18:50.280\n and I can mimic it through a radar screen\n\n18:50.280 --> 18:53.280\n and create images like the bat,\n\n18:53.280 --> 18:55.720\n its consciousness somehow perceives it, right?\n\n18:55.720 --> 19:00.240\n So the beauty of human reason is our capacity\n\n19:00.240 --> 19:02.840\n to understand the world beyond\n\n19:02.840 --> 19:05.200\n what our senses give us directly.\n\n19:05.200 --> 19:07.840\n At the end, everything comes in through our senses,\n\n19:07.840 --> 19:10.320\n but we can understand things\n\n19:10.320 --> 19:11.520\n that our senses don't provide us.\n\n19:11.520 --> 19:14.920\n But what he's doing is he's doing something very different.\n\n19:14.920 --> 19:17.400\n He is saying what our senses provides us\n\n19:17.400 --> 19:20.640\n might have nothing to do with the reality out there.\n\n19:20.640 --> 19:25.640\n That is just a random, arbitrary, nonsensical statement.\n\n19:25.680 --> 19:27.240\n And he actually has a whole\n\n19:27.240 --> 19:28.840\n evolutionary explanation for it.\n\n19:28.840 --> 19:30.640\n He runs some simulations.\n\n19:30.640 --> 19:32.400\n The simulations seem, I mean,\n\n19:32.400 --> 19:33.720\n I'm not an expert on this field,\n\n19:33.720 --> 19:35.320\n but they seem silly to me.\n\n19:35.320 --> 19:36.720\n They don't seem to reflect.\n\n19:36.720 --> 19:38.680\n And look, all he's doing is taking\n\n19:38.680 --> 19:41.040\n Immanuel Kant's philosophy,\n\n19:41.040 --> 19:43.200\n which articulate exactly the same cause,\n\n19:43.200 --> 19:48.200\n and he's giving it a veneer of evolutionary ideas.\n\n19:48.920 --> 19:50.360\n I'm not an expert on evolution,\n\n19:50.360 --> 19:52.240\n and I'm not an expert on epistemology,\n\n19:52.240 --> 19:53.560\n which is what this is.\n\n19:53.560 --> 19:57.080\n So to me, as a semi layman,\n\n19:57.080 --> 19:58.760\n it doesn't make any sense.\n\n19:58.760 --> 20:02.480\n And, you know, I'm actually,\n\n20:02.480 --> 20:04.240\n you know, I have this Yaron Book Show.\n\n20:04.240 --> 20:05.480\n I don't know if I'm allowed to pitch it,\n\n20:05.480 --> 20:08.320\n but I've got this Yaron Book Show on YouTube.\n\n20:08.320 --> 20:11.080\n I'm a huge fan of the Yaron Book Show.\n\n20:11.080 --> 20:12.760\n I listen to it very often.\n\n20:12.760 --> 20:17.760\n As a small aside, the cool thing about reason,\n\n20:17.960 --> 20:19.880\n which you practice,\n\n20:19.880 --> 20:21.880\n is you have a systematic way of thinking\n\n20:21.880 --> 20:24.320\n through basically anything.\n\n20:24.320 --> 20:25.360\n Yes.\n\n20:25.360 --> 20:27.520\n And that's so fun to listen to.\n\n20:27.520 --> 20:32.520\n I mean, it's rare that I think there's flaws in your logic,\n\n20:32.640 --> 20:34.480\n but even then it's fun,\n\n20:34.480 --> 20:37.280\n because I'm like disagreeing with the screen.\n\n20:37.280 --> 20:39.040\n And it's great when somebody disagrees with me\n\n20:39.040 --> 20:40.480\n and they give good arguments,\n\n20:40.480 --> 20:42.200\n because that makes it challenging.\n\n20:42.200 --> 20:43.040\n Anyway, sorry.\n\n20:43.040 --> 20:45.200\n You know, so one of the shows I want to do\n\n20:45.200 --> 20:47.720\n in the next few weeks is one of my philosophy,\n\n20:47.720 --> 20:50.240\n bring one of my philosophy friends to discuss the video\n\n20:50.240 --> 20:52.760\n that Hoffman, where he presents his theory,\n\n20:52.760 --> 20:57.760\n because it surprises me how seductive it is.\n\n20:58.360 --> 21:00.240\n And it seems to be so,\n\n21:00.240 --> 21:01.920\n first of all, completely counterintuitive,\n\n21:01.920 --> 21:05.800\n but because, you know, somehow we managed to cross the road\n\n21:05.800 --> 21:06.960\n and not get hit by the car.\n\n21:06.960 --> 21:10.040\n And if our senses did not provide us any information\n\n21:10.040 --> 21:12.160\n about what's actually going on in reality,\n\n21:12.160 --> 21:13.600\n how do we do that?\n\n21:13.600 --> 21:16.000\n And not to mention build computers,\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:17.560\n not to mention fly to the moon\n\n21:17.560 --> 21:18.600\n and actually land on the moon.\n\n21:18.600 --> 21:21.760\n And if reality is not giving us information about the moon,\n\n21:21.760 --> 21:24.560\n if our senses are not giving us information about the moon,\n\n21:24.560 --> 21:25.600\n how did we get there?\n\n21:25.600 --> 21:27.080\n You know, and where did we go?\n\n21:27.080 --> 21:28.840\n Maybe we didn't go anywhere.\n\n21:28.840 --> 21:30.880\n It's just, it's nonsensical to me.\n\n21:30.880 --> 21:35.880\n And it's a very bad place philosophically,\n\n21:37.080 --> 21:38.640\n because it basically says\n\n21:38.640 --> 21:40.760\n there is no objective standard for anything.\n\n21:40.760 --> 21:42.440\n There is no objective reality.\n\n21:42.440 --> 21:43.560\n You can come up with anything.\n\n21:43.560 --> 21:44.640\n You could argue anything.\n\n21:44.640 --> 21:46.000\n And there's no methodology, right?\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.120\n My, I believe that at the end of the day,\n\n21:48.120 --> 21:50.000\n what reason allows us to do\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.160\n is provides us with a methodology for truth.\n\n21:52.160 --> 21:54.720\n And at the end of the day, for every claim that I make,\n\n21:54.720 --> 21:59.000\n I should be able to boil it down to see,\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:02.560\n yeah, look, the evidence of the census is right then.\n\n22:02.560 --> 22:05.000\n Once you take that away, knowledge is gone\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:06.200\n and truth is gone.\n\n22:06.200 --> 22:09.640\n And that opens it up to, you know, complete disaster.\n\n22:09.640 --> 22:12.720\n So, you know, to me why it's compelling\n\n22:12.720 --> 22:16.160\n to at least entertain this idea,\n\n22:16.160 --> 22:18.920\n first of all, it shakes up the mind a little bit\n\n22:18.920 --> 22:23.920\n to force you to go back to first principles\n\n22:24.080 --> 22:27.360\n and, you know, ask the question, what do I really know?\n\n22:27.360 --> 22:31.440\n And the second part of that that I really enjoy\n\n22:31.440 --> 22:35.400\n is it's a reminder that we know very little\n\n22:35.400 --> 22:37.320\n to be a little bit more humble.\n\n22:37.320 --> 22:40.560\n So if reality doesn't exist at all,\n\n22:40.560 --> 22:43.040\n before you start thinking about it,\n\n22:43.040 --> 22:46.640\n I think it's a really nice wake up call to think,\n\n22:46.640 --> 22:51.160\n wait a minute, I don't really know much about this universe,\n\n22:51.160 --> 22:52.640\n that humbleness.\n\n22:52.640 --> 22:54.960\n I think something I'd like to ask you about\n\n22:54.960 --> 22:57.280\n in terms of reason, when you,\n\n22:58.160 --> 22:59.920\n you can become very confident\n\n23:00.880 --> 23:03.040\n in your ability to understand the world\n\n23:03.040 --> 23:04.840\n if you practice reason often.\n\n23:04.840 --> 23:07.920\n And I feel like it can lead you astray\n\n23:07.920 --> 23:10.440\n because you can start to think,\n\n23:10.440 --> 23:12.960\n it's, so I love psychology\n\n23:12.960 --> 23:15.400\n and psychologists have the certainty\n\n23:15.400 --> 23:17.880\n about understanding the human condition,\n\n23:17.880 --> 23:19.560\n which is undeserved.\n\n23:19.560 --> 23:21.600\n You know, you run a study with 50 people\n\n23:21.600 --> 23:23.720\n and you think you can understand\n\n23:23.720 --> 23:25.640\n the source of all these psychiatric disorders,\n\n23:25.640 --> 23:27.160\n all these kinds of things.\n\n23:27.160 --> 23:28.920\n That's similar kind of trouble\n\n23:28.920 --> 23:31.880\n I feel like you can get into\n\n23:31.880 --> 23:35.320\n when you overreach with reason.\n\n23:35.320 --> 23:36.560\n So I don't think there is such a thing\n\n23:36.560 --> 23:38.240\n as overreaching with reason,\n\n23:38.240 --> 23:40.520\n but there are bad applications of reason.\n\n23:40.520 --> 23:42.120\n There are bad uses of reason\n\n23:42.120 --> 23:44.400\n or the pretense of using reason.\n\n23:44.400 --> 23:46.760\n I think a lot of these psychological studies\n\n23:46.760 --> 23:48.160\n are pretense of using reason.\n\n23:48.160 --> 23:51.080\n And the psychologists have never really taken\n\n23:51.080 --> 23:53.600\n a serious stat class or a serious econometrics class.\n\n23:53.600 --> 23:55.760\n So they use statistics in weird ways\n\n23:55.760 --> 23:57.320\n that just don't make any sense.\n\n23:57.320 --> 23:59.440\n And that's a miss, that's not reason, right?\n\n23:59.440 --> 24:01.120\n That's just bad thinking, right?\n\n24:01.120 --> 24:05.000\n So I don't think you can do too much good thinking.\n\n24:05.880 --> 24:07.360\n And that's what reason is.\n\n24:07.360 --> 24:08.560\n It's good thinking.\n\n24:08.560 --> 24:13.560\n Now, the fact that you try to use reason\n\n24:14.280 --> 24:17.000\n does not guarantee you won't make mistakes.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:18.840\n It doesn't guarantee you won't be wrong.\n\n24:18.840 --> 24:21.760\n It doesn't guarantee you won't go down a rabbit hole\n\n24:21.760 --> 24:24.320\n and completely get it wrong.\n\n24:24.320 --> 24:29.160\n But it does give you the only existing mechanism to fix it.\n\n24:29.160 --> 24:30.320\n Which is going back to reality,\n\n24:30.320 --> 24:32.600\n going back to facts, going back to reason.\n\n24:32.600 --> 24:34.760\n And getting out of the rabbit hole\n\n24:34.760 --> 24:37.320\n and getting back to reality.\n\n24:37.320 --> 24:40.160\n So I agree with you that it's interesting\n\n24:40.160 --> 24:44.640\n to think about these, what I consider crazy ideas\n\n24:44.640 --> 24:47.760\n because it, oh wait, what is my argument about them?\n\n24:47.760 --> 24:49.840\n If I don't really have a good argument about them,\n\n24:49.840 --> 24:51.040\n then do I know what I know?\n\n24:51.040 --> 24:53.880\n So in that sense, it's always nice to be challenged\n\n24:53.880 --> 24:55.960\n and pushed and oriented.\n\n24:55.960 --> 24:58.320\n You know, the nice thing about objectivism is\n\n24:58.320 --> 25:00.240\n everybody's doing that to me all the time, right?\n\n25:00.240 --> 25:01.760\n Because nobody agrees with me on anything.\n\n25:01.760 --> 25:04.080\n So I'm constantly being challenged,\n\n25:04.080 --> 25:07.440\n whether it's in, by Hoffman on metaphysics\n\n25:07.440 --> 25:08.400\n and epistemology, right?\n\n25:08.400 --> 25:10.480\n On the very foundations of analogy and ethics,\n\n25:10.480 --> 25:13.960\n everybody constantly, and in politics all the time.\n\n25:13.960 --> 25:18.480\n So I find that it's part of, you know,\n\n25:18.480 --> 25:20.200\n I prefer that everybody, there's a sense\n\n25:20.200 --> 25:22.520\n in which I prefer that everybody agreed with me, right?\n\n25:22.520 --> 25:24.400\n Because I think we'd live in a better world.\n\n25:24.400 --> 25:27.600\n But there's a sense in which that disagreement makes it,\n\n25:27.600 --> 25:30.280\n at least up to a point, makes it interesting\n\n25:30.280 --> 25:35.280\n and challenging and forces you to be able to rethink\n\n25:35.640 --> 25:37.320\n or to confirm your own thinking\n\n25:37.320 --> 25:39.520\n and to challenge that thinking.\n\n25:39.520 --> 25:42.240\n Can you try to do the impossible task\n\n25:42.240 --> 25:46.200\n and give a whirlwind introduction to Ayn Rand,\n\n25:46.200 --> 25:49.280\n the many sides of Ayn Rand?\n\n25:49.280 --> 25:53.800\n So Ayn Rand the human being, Ayn Rand the novelist,\n\n25:53.800 --> 25:56.040\n and Ayn Rand the philosopher.\n\n25:56.040 --> 25:57.760\n So who was Ayn Rand?\n\n25:57.760 --> 26:02.760\n Sure, so her life story is one that I think is fascinating\n\n26:04.160 --> 26:07.400\n but it also lends itself to this integration\n\n26:07.400 --> 26:08.840\n of all of these things.\n\n26:08.840 --> 26:12.600\n She was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905\n\n26:12.600 --> 26:16.440\n to kind of a middle class family, Jewish family.\n\n26:16.440 --> 26:20.560\n They owned a pharmacy, her father owned a pharmacy.\n\n26:20.560 --> 26:25.000\n And, you know, she grew up, she grew up,\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:28.960\n she was a very, she knew what she wanted to do\n\n26:28.960 --> 26:31.160\n and what she wanted to be from a very young age.\n\n26:31.160 --> 26:32.320\n I think from the age of nine,\n\n26:32.320 --> 26:33.600\n she knew she wanted to be a writer.\n\n26:33.600 --> 26:34.960\n She wanted to write stories.\n\n26:34.960 --> 26:37.320\n That was the thing she wanted to do.\n\n26:37.320 --> 26:41.480\n And, you know, she focused her life after that\n\n26:41.480 --> 26:44.880\n on this goal of I wanna be a novelist, I wanna write.\n\n26:46.120 --> 26:50.000\n And the philosophy was incidental to that in a sense,\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.680\n at least until some point in her life.\n\n26:52.680 --> 26:55.680\n She witnessed the Russian Revolution,\n\n26:55.680 --> 26:57.000\n literally it happened outside.\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.320\n They lived in St. Petersburg\n\n26:59.320 --> 27:01.360\n where the first kind of demonstrations\n\n27:01.360 --> 27:03.440\n and of the revolution happened.\n\n27:03.440 --> 27:04.520\n So she witnessed it.\n\n27:04.520 --> 27:06.720\n She lived through it as a teenager,\n\n27:07.680 --> 27:10.880\n went to school under the Soviets.\n\n27:10.880 --> 27:15.160\n For a while, they were under kind of on the Black Sea\n\n27:15.160 --> 27:18.040\n where the opposition government was ruling\n\n27:18.040 --> 27:19.760\n and then they would go back and forth\n\n27:19.760 --> 27:21.800\n between the commies and the whites.\n\n27:21.800 --> 27:23.800\n But she experienced what communism was like.\n\n27:23.800 --> 27:26.680\n She saw the pharmacy being taken away from a family.\n\n27:26.680 --> 27:28.880\n She saw their apartment being taken away\n\n27:28.880 --> 27:30.520\n or other families being brought\n\n27:30.520 --> 27:32.640\n into the apartment they already lived in.\n\n27:33.840 --> 27:38.600\n And it was very clear given her nature,\n\n27:38.600 --> 27:42.040\n given her views, even at a very young age\n\n27:42.040 --> 27:44.640\n that she would not survive the system.\n\n27:44.640 --> 27:48.360\n So a lot of effort was put into how did she get out?\n\n27:48.360 --> 27:51.240\n And her family was really helpful in this.\n\n27:51.240 --> 27:54.080\n And she had a cousin in Chicago\n\n27:54.080 --> 27:59.080\n and she had been studying kind of film at the university and...\n\n27:59.440 --> 28:00.440\n This is in her 20s?\n\n28:00.440 --> 28:03.200\n This is in her 20s, early 20s.\n\n28:03.200 --> 28:06.800\n And Lenin, there was a small window\n\n28:06.800 --> 28:09.240\n where Lenin was allowing some people\n\n28:09.240 --> 28:12.440\n to leave under certain circumstances.\n\n28:12.440 --> 28:15.800\n And she managed to get out to go do research on film\n\n28:15.800 --> 28:17.120\n in the United States.\n\n28:17.120 --> 28:19.200\n Everybody knew, everybody who knew her\n\n28:19.200 --> 28:21.120\n knew she would never come back,\n\n28:21.120 --> 28:22.480\n that this was a one way ticket.\n\n28:22.480 --> 28:24.520\n And she got out, she made it to Chicago,\n\n28:24.520 --> 28:28.840\n spent a few weeks in Chicago, and then headed to Hollywood.\n\n28:28.840 --> 28:32.440\n She wanted to write scripts, that was the goal.\n\n28:32.440 --> 28:37.440\n Here's this short woman from Russia with a strong accent,\n\n28:38.160 --> 28:41.680\n learning English, showing up in Hollywood\n\n28:41.680 --> 28:43.600\n and I wanna be a script writer.\n\n28:43.600 --> 28:44.480\n In English.\n\n28:44.480 --> 28:46.520\n In English, writing in English.\n\n28:46.520 --> 28:51.160\n And this is kind of one of these fairytale stories,\n\n28:51.160 --> 28:55.460\n but it's true, she shows up at the Cecil B. DeMille Studios.\n\n28:56.400 --> 28:59.720\n And she has a letter of introduction from her cousin\n\n28:59.720 --> 29:02.040\n in Chicago who owns a movie theater.\n\n29:02.040 --> 29:05.920\n And this is in the late 1920s.\n\n29:05.920 --> 29:08.440\n And she shows up there with this letter and they say,\n\n29:08.440 --> 29:10.400\n don't call us, we'll call you kind of thing.\n\n29:10.400 --> 29:15.400\n And she steps out and there's this massive convertible.\n\n29:15.400 --> 29:18.000\n And in the convertible is Cecil B. DeMille.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.120\n And he's driving slowly past her\n\n29:20.120 --> 29:21.520\n right at the entrance of the studio.\n\n29:21.520 --> 29:23.840\n And she stares at him and he stops the car and he says,\n\n29:23.840 --> 29:25.720\n why are you staring at me?\n\n29:25.720 --> 29:28.200\n And she says, she tells him a story from Russia\n\n29:28.200 --> 29:30.060\n and I wanna make it in the movies,\n\n29:30.060 --> 29:31.560\n I wanna be a script writer one day.\n\n29:31.560 --> 29:35.000\n And he says, well, if you want that, get in the car.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:38.200\n She gets in the car and he takes her to the back lot\n\n29:38.200 --> 29:40.360\n of his studio where they're filming The King of Kings,\n\n29:40.360 --> 29:41.960\n the story of Jesus.\n\n29:41.960 --> 29:45.160\n And he says, here's a pass for a week.\n\n29:45.160 --> 29:47.280\n If you wanna write for the movies,\n\n29:47.280 --> 29:49.680\n you better know how movies are made.\n\n29:49.680 --> 29:51.680\n And she basically spends a week in there.\n\n29:51.680 --> 29:53.120\n She spends more time there.\n\n29:53.120 --> 29:54.480\n She managed to get an extension.\n\n29:54.480 --> 29:56.080\n She lands up being an extra in the movie.\n\n29:56.080 --> 30:00.800\n So you can see Ayn Rand there is one of the masses\n\n30:00.800 --> 30:03.000\n when Jesus is walking by.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.560\n She meets her future husband on the sets\n\n30:05.560 --> 30:07.320\n of The King of Kings.\n\n30:07.320 --> 30:09.160\n She lands up getting married,\n\n30:09.160 --> 30:12.120\n getting her American citizenship that way.\n\n30:12.120 --> 30:15.840\n And she lands up doing odds and ends jobs in Hollywood,\n\n30:15.840 --> 30:17.640\n living in a tiny little apartment,\n\n30:19.340 --> 30:20.680\n somehow making a living.\n\n30:20.680 --> 30:22.000\n Her husband was an actor.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:26.560\n He was struggling actors were difficult times.\n\n30:26.560 --> 30:28.760\n And in the evenings, studying English,\n\n30:28.760 --> 30:30.440\n writing, writing, writing, writing,\n\n30:30.440 --> 30:31.840\n and studying and studying and studying.\n\n30:31.840 --> 30:34.640\n And she finally makes it by writing a play\n\n30:34.640 --> 30:39.640\n that is successful in LA and ultimately goes to Broadway.\n\n30:39.640 --> 30:44.640\n And her first novel is a novel called We The Living,\n\n30:44.720 --> 30:47.880\n which is the most autobiographical of all her novels.\n\n30:47.880 --> 30:51.480\n It's about a young woman in the Soviet Union.\n\n30:51.480 --> 30:55.200\n It's a powerful story, a very moving story,\n\n30:55.200 --> 30:58.360\n and probably, if not the best,\n\n30:58.360 --> 31:02.160\n one of the best portrayals of life under communism.\n\n31:02.160 --> 31:02.980\n And how powerful.\n\n31:02.980 --> 31:03.820\n So you would recommend the book?\n\n31:03.820 --> 31:05.160\n Definitely recommend We The Living.\n\n31:05.160 --> 31:06.560\n It's her first novel.\n\n31:06.560 --> 31:08.400\n She wrote it in the spring of 2000.\n\n31:08.400 --> 31:11.360\n First novel she wrote in the 30s.\n\n31:11.360 --> 31:13.240\n And it didn't go anywhere.\n\n31:13.240 --> 31:16.000\n Because if you think about the intelligentsia,\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:20.280\n the people who matter, the people who wrote book reviews,\n\n31:20.280 --> 31:23.400\n this is a time of Durante,\n\n31:23.400 --> 31:25.920\n who's the New York Times guy in Moscow,\n\n31:25.920 --> 31:29.740\n who's praising Stalin to the hills and the success.\n\n31:29.740 --> 31:34.240\n So the novel fails, but she's got a novel out.\n\n31:34.240 --> 31:36.800\n She writes a small novelette called Anthem.\n\n31:36.800 --> 31:38.880\n A lot of people have read that, and it's read\n\n31:38.880 --> 31:39.800\n in high schools.\n\n31:39.800 --> 31:42.160\n It's kind of a dystopian novel,\n\n31:42.160 --> 31:45.800\n and it doesn't get published in the U.S.\n\n31:45.800 --> 31:47.120\n It gets published in the U.K.\n\n31:47.120 --> 31:50.240\n U.K. is very interested in dystopian novels.\n\n31:50.240 --> 31:54.000\n Animal Farm in 1984,\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:57.380\n 84 is published a couple of years after, I think,\n\n31:57.380 --> 31:58.880\n after Anthem.\n\n31:58.880 --> 32:01.580\n There's reason to believe he read Anthem.\n\n32:01.580 --> 32:06.580\n And George Orwell read Animal Farm.\n\n32:07.620 --> 32:11.100\n Just a small aside, Animal Farm is probably top.\n\n32:11.100 --> 32:12.960\n I mean, it's weird to say,\n\n32:12.960 --> 32:14.860\n but I would say it's my favorite book.\n\n32:14.860 --> 32:17.580\n Have you seen this movie out now called Mr. Jones?\n\n32:17.580 --> 32:18.420\n No.\n\n32:18.420 --> 32:19.580\n Oh, you've got to see Mr. Jones.\n\n32:19.580 --> 32:21.020\n What's Mr. Jones?\n\n32:21.020 --> 32:22.020\n It's a...\n\n32:22.020 --> 32:22.940\n Sorry for my ignorance.\n\n32:22.940 --> 32:25.620\n No, no, it's a movie, and it hasn't got any publicity,\n\n32:25.620 --> 32:28.180\n which is tragic, because it's a really good movie.\n\n32:28.180 --> 32:29.620\n It's both brilliantly made.\n\n32:29.620 --> 32:31.540\n It's made by a Polish director.\n\n32:31.540 --> 32:32.940\n But it's in English.\n\n32:32.940 --> 32:34.300\n It's a true story,\n\n32:34.300 --> 32:37.540\n and George Orwell's Animal Farm is featured in it\n\n32:37.540 --> 32:40.200\n in the sense that during the story,\n\n32:40.200 --> 32:42.540\n George Orwell is writing Animal Farm,\n\n32:42.540 --> 32:47.300\n and the narrator is reading off sections of Animal Farm\n\n32:47.300 --> 32:49.340\n as the movie is progressing.\n\n32:49.340 --> 32:50.920\n And the movie is a true story\n\n32:50.920 --> 32:55.660\n about the first Western journalist to discover\n\n32:55.660 --> 32:57.700\n and to write about the famine in Ukraine.\n\n32:58.660 --> 33:01.020\n And so he goes to Moscow, and then he gets on a train,\n\n33:01.020 --> 33:02.220\n and he finds himself in Ukraine,\n\n33:02.220 --> 33:05.740\n and it's beautifully and horrifically made.\n\n33:05.740 --> 33:10.460\n So the horror of the famine is brilliantly conveyed.\n\n33:10.460 --> 33:13.020\n And it's a true story, so it's a very moving story,\n\n33:13.020 --> 33:16.540\n very powerful story, and just very well made movie.\n\n33:16.540 --> 33:18.540\n So it's tragic, in my view,\n\n33:18.540 --> 33:20.340\n that not more people are seeing it.\n\n33:20.340 --> 33:23.220\n I was actually recently just complaining\n\n33:23.220 --> 33:25.800\n that there's not enough content\n\n33:25.800 --> 33:29.460\n on the famine in the 30s of stuff.\n\n33:29.460 --> 33:30.580\n There's so much on Hitler.\n\n33:30.580 --> 33:32.500\n I love the reading.\n\n33:32.500 --> 33:35.860\n I'm reading, it's so long, it's been taking me forever,\n\n33:35.860 --> 33:37.740\n The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\n\n33:37.740 --> 33:39.380\n Yeah, I love it, but.\n\n33:39.380 --> 33:40.980\n Well, I've got the book to compliment that,\n\n33:40.980 --> 33:42.140\n that you have to read.\n\n33:42.140 --> 33:44.180\n It's called The Ominous Parallels.\n\n33:44.180 --> 33:47.060\n It's Lennon Peacock, and it's The Ominous Parallels,\n\n33:47.060 --> 33:52.060\n and it's about the causes of the rise of Hitler,\n\n33:52.740 --> 33:54.220\n but a philosophical causes.\n\n33:54.220 --> 33:58.500\n So whereas The Rise and Fall is more of a kind of,\n\n33:58.500 --> 34:00.880\n the existential kind of what happened,\n\n34:02.900 --> 34:07.700\n but really delving into the intellectual currents\n\n34:07.700 --> 34:11.820\n that led to the rise of Hitler, highly recommend that.\n\n34:11.820 --> 34:15.780\n Basically suggesting how it might rise another.\n\n34:15.780 --> 34:17.220\n That's The Ominous Parallels,\n\n34:17.220 --> 34:20.460\n so the parallel he draws is to the United States,\n\n34:20.460 --> 34:22.660\n and he says those same intellectual forces\n\n34:22.660 --> 34:23.820\n are rising in the United States,\n\n34:23.820 --> 34:28.820\n and this was published, I think, in, published in 82.\n\n34:28.820 --> 34:30.260\n It was published in 82.\n\n34:30.260 --> 34:31.740\n So it was published a long time ago,\n\n34:31.740 --> 34:34.600\n and yet you look around us,\n\n34:34.600 --> 34:37.220\n and it's unbelievably predictive, sadly,\n\n34:37.220 --> 34:38.740\n about the state of the world.\n\n34:38.740 --> 34:40.140\n So I haven't finished Iron Man's story.\n\n34:40.140 --> 34:41.460\n I don't know if you want me to finish it.\n\n34:41.460 --> 34:44.340\n No, no, no, but on that point, I'll have to,\n\n34:44.340 --> 34:46.820\n let's please return to it, but let's now,\n\n34:46.820 --> 34:47.860\n for now, let's talk.\n\n34:47.860 --> 34:49.580\n Let me also say, just because,\n\n34:49.580 --> 34:51.680\n I don't want to forget about Mr. Jones,\n\n34:51.680 --> 34:54.420\n it is true, the point you made,\n\n34:54.420 --> 34:57.580\n there are tons of movies that are anti fascist,\n\n34:57.580 --> 35:00.900\n anti Nazi, and that's good,\n\n35:00.900 --> 35:03.860\n but there are way too few movies that are anti communist,\n\n35:03.860 --> 35:06.900\n just almost not, and it's very interesting,\n\n35:06.900 --> 35:09.300\n and if you remind me later, I'll tell you a story about that.\n\n35:09.300 --> 35:13.900\n But so she publishes Anthem, and then she starts,\n\n35:13.900 --> 35:15.740\n and she's doing okay in Hollywood,\n\n35:15.740 --> 35:18.060\n and she's doing okay with the play,\n\n35:18.060 --> 35:21.620\n and then she starts on the book The Fountainhead,\n\n35:21.620 --> 35:25.220\n and she writes The Fountainhead, and it comes out,\n\n35:25.220 --> 35:28.300\n she finishes it in 1945,\n\n35:28.300 --> 35:33.300\n and she sends it to publishers,\n\n35:33.660 --> 35:37.060\n and publisher after publisher after publisher turn it down,\n\n35:37.060 --> 35:41.860\n and it takes 12 publishers before this editor reads it,\n\n35:41.860 --> 35:44.760\n and says, I want to publish this book,\n\n35:44.760 --> 35:47.060\n and he basically tells his bosses,\n\n35:47.060 --> 35:52.060\n if you don't publish this book, I'm leaving, right?\n\n35:52.340 --> 35:54.700\n And they don't really believe in the book,\n\n35:54.700 --> 35:56.500\n so they publish just a few copies,\n\n35:56.500 --> 35:58.580\n they don't do a mat lot,\n\n35:58.580 --> 36:00.900\n and the book becomes a bestseller from word of mouth,\n\n36:00.900 --> 36:02.900\n and they land up having to publish more and more and more,\n\n36:02.900 --> 36:07.500\n and she's basically gone from this immigrant\n\n36:07.500 --> 36:10.060\n who comes here with very little command of English,\n\n36:10.060 --> 36:14.820\n and to all kinds of odds and ends jobs in Hollywood,\n\n36:14.820 --> 36:19.820\n to writing one of the seminal, I think, American books.\n\n36:21.900 --> 36:24.020\n She is an American author.\n\n36:24.020 --> 36:27.500\n I mean, if you read The Fountainhead, it's not Russian.\n\n36:27.500 --> 36:29.180\n This is not Dostoevsky.\n\n36:29.180 --> 36:32.760\n It feels like a symbol of what America is\n\n36:32.760 --> 36:37.760\n in the 20th century, and I mean, probably, maybe you can,\n\n36:38.260 --> 36:42.460\n so there's a famous kind of sexual rape scene in there.\n\n36:42.460 --> 36:44.780\n Is that like a lesson you wanna throw in\n\n36:44.780 --> 36:46.440\n some controversial stuff\n\n36:46.440 --> 36:49.340\n to make your philosophical books work out?\n\n36:49.340 --> 36:51.980\n I mean, why was it so popular?\n\n36:51.980 --> 36:53.260\n Do you have a sense?\n\n36:53.260 --> 36:54.100\n Or is it just?\n\n36:54.100 --> 36:55.780\n Well, because I think it illustrated,\n\n36:55.780 --> 36:58.940\n first of all, because I think the characters are fantastic.\n\n36:58.940 --> 37:02.840\n It's got a real hero, and I think the whole book\n\n37:02.840 --> 37:05.860\n is basically illustrating this massive conflict\n\n37:05.860 --> 37:09.280\n that I think went on in America then, is going on today,\n\n37:09.280 --> 37:12.500\n and it goes on on a big scale, politics,\n\n37:12.500 --> 37:13.980\n all the way down to the scale\n\n37:13.980 --> 37:16.180\n of the choices you make in your life.\n\n37:16.180 --> 37:20.180\n And the issue is individualism versus collectivism.\n\n37:21.100 --> 37:22.420\n Should you live for yourself?\n\n37:22.420 --> 37:23.660\n Should you live for your values?\n\n37:23.660 --> 37:25.500\n Should you pursue your passions?\n\n37:26.980 --> 37:29.060\n Or should you do what your mother tells you?\n\n37:29.060 --> 37:31.620\n Should you follow your mother's passions?\n\n37:31.620 --> 37:40.620\n And it's very, very much a book about individuals,\n\n37:40.860 --> 37:42.620\n and people relate to that.\n\n37:42.620 --> 37:45.700\n But it obviously has this massive implications\n\n37:45.700 --> 37:47.100\n to the world outside,\n\n37:47.100 --> 37:50.980\n and at the time of collectivism just having been defeated,\n\n37:50.980 --> 37:53.580\n communism, well, fascism,\n\n37:53.580 --> 37:58.620\n and the United States representing individualism\n\n37:58.620 --> 38:01.420\n as defeated collectivism.\n\n38:01.420 --> 38:03.820\n But where collectivist ideas are still popular\n\n38:03.820 --> 38:06.260\n in the form of socialism and communism.\n\n38:06.260 --> 38:09.100\n And for the individual, there's constant struggle\n\n38:09.100 --> 38:10.940\n between what people tell me to do,\n\n38:10.940 --> 38:12.100\n what society tells me to do,\n\n38:12.100 --> 38:13.260\n what my mother tells me to do,\n\n38:13.260 --> 38:15.260\n and what I think I should do.\n\n38:15.260 --> 38:17.580\n I think it's unbelievably appealing,\n\n38:17.580 --> 38:18.860\n particularly to young people\n\n38:18.860 --> 38:21.500\n who's trying to figure out what they wanna do in life,\n\n38:21.500 --> 38:23.740\n trying to figure out what's important in life.\n\n38:24.620 --> 38:27.340\n It had this enormous appeal, it's romantic,\n\n38:27.340 --> 38:29.940\n it's bigger than life, the characters are big heroes.\n\n38:29.940 --> 38:31.660\n It's very American in that sense.\n\n38:31.660 --> 38:32.940\n It's about individualism,\n\n38:32.940 --> 38:35.500\n it's about the triumph of individualism.\n\n38:35.500 --> 38:38.900\n And so I think that's what related,\n\n38:38.900 --> 38:42.980\n and it had this big romantic element from the,\n\n38:42.980 --> 38:44.260\n I mean, when I use romantic,\n\n38:44.260 --> 38:49.260\n I use it kind of in the sense of a movement in art.\n\n38:49.900 --> 38:51.620\n But it also has this romantic element\n\n38:51.620 --> 38:54.180\n in the sense of a relationship between a man and woman\n\n38:54.180 --> 38:55.660\n who's, that's very intriguing.\n\n38:55.660 --> 38:58.180\n It's not only that there's a,\n\n38:58.180 --> 39:00.460\n I would say almost rape scene, right?\n\n39:01.340 --> 39:03.620\n I would say, but it's also that this woman\n\n39:03.620 --> 39:04.980\n is hard to understand.\n\n39:04.980 --> 39:06.900\n I mean, I've read it more than once,\n\n39:06.900 --> 39:09.500\n and I still can't quite figure out Dominique, right?\n\n39:09.500 --> 39:11.620\n Because she loves him and she wants to destroy him\n\n39:11.620 --> 39:13.020\n and she marries other people.\n\n39:13.020 --> 39:14.220\n I mean, think about that too.\n\n39:14.220 --> 39:16.220\n Here she's writing a book in the 1940s.\n\n39:18.580 --> 39:19.860\n There's lots of sex.\n\n39:20.700 --> 39:23.700\n There's a woman who marries more than one person,\n\n39:23.700 --> 39:25.860\n has having sex with more than one person,\n\n39:25.860 --> 39:27.340\n very unconventional.\n\n39:27.340 --> 39:29.860\n She's having married, she's having sex with work\n\n39:29.860 --> 39:31.060\n even though she's not married to work.\n\n39:31.060 --> 39:33.100\n This is 1945.\n\n39:33.100 --> 39:36.940\n And it's very jarring to people.\n\n39:36.940 --> 39:39.820\n It's very unexpected, but it's also a book of its time.\n\n39:39.820 --> 39:42.420\n It's about individuals pursuing their passion,\n\n39:42.420 --> 39:45.540\n pursuing their life and not caring about convention\n\n39:45.540 --> 39:50.100\n and what people think, but doing what they think is right.\n\n39:50.100 --> 39:54.340\n And so I think it's,\n\n39:54.340 --> 39:56.340\n I encourage everybody to read this, obviously.\n\n39:56.340 --> 39:58.300\n So that was, was that the first time\n\n39:58.300 --> 40:03.300\n she articulated something that sounded like a philosophy\n\n40:03.940 --> 40:04.900\n of individualism?\n\n40:04.900 --> 40:08.660\n I mean, the philosophy's there in We The Living, right?\n\n40:08.660 --> 40:12.620\n Because at the end of the day, the woman is,\n\n40:12.620 --> 40:16.060\n the hero of We The Living is this individualist\n\n40:16.060 --> 40:17.300\n stuck in Soviet Union.\n\n40:17.300 --> 40:19.220\n So she's struggling with these things.\n\n40:20.260 --> 40:22.380\n So the theme is there already.\n\n40:22.380 --> 40:23.900\n It's not as fleshed out.\n\n40:23.900 --> 40:26.380\n It's not as articulated philosophically.\n\n40:26.380 --> 40:29.820\n And it's certainly then Anthem, which is a dystopian novel\n\n40:29.820 --> 40:33.660\n where this dystopia in the future has a,\n\n40:33.660 --> 40:36.660\n there's no I, everything is we.\n\n40:37.580 --> 40:40.940\n And it's about one guy who breaks out of that.\n\n40:40.940 --> 40:43.460\n I don't want to give it away, but breaks out of that.\n\n40:43.460 --> 40:48.060\n So these themes are running and then we have,\n\n40:48.060 --> 40:48.980\n and they've been published,\n\n40:48.980 --> 40:53.060\n some of the early Ayn Rand stories that she was writing\n\n40:53.060 --> 40:54.740\n in preparation for writing her novel,\n\n40:54.740 --> 40:57.300\n stories she was writing when she first came to America.\n\n40:57.300 --> 41:01.140\n And you can see these same philosophical elements,\n\n41:01.140 --> 41:04.780\n even in the male, female relationships and the passion\n\n41:04.780 --> 41:07.980\n and the, you know, in the conflict,\n\n41:07.980 --> 41:10.820\n you see them even in those early pieces.\n\n41:10.820 --> 41:12.340\n And she's just developing them.\n\n41:12.340 --> 41:13.900\n It's same philosophically,\n\n41:13.900 --> 41:17.780\n she's developing her philosophy with her literature.\n\n41:17.780 --> 41:20.020\n And of course, after The Fountainhead,\n\n41:20.020 --> 41:22.540\n she starts on what turns out to be her Magnus Opus,\n\n41:22.540 --> 41:24.300\n which is Atlas Shrugged,\n\n41:24.300 --> 41:26.140\n which takes her 12 years to publish.\n\n41:26.140 --> 41:28.700\n By the time, of course, she brings that out,\n\n41:28.700 --> 41:31.020\n every publisher in New York wants to publish it\n\n41:31.020 --> 41:34.220\n because The Fountainhead has been such a huge success.\n\n41:34.220 --> 41:35.380\n They don't quite understand it.\n\n41:35.380 --> 41:37.140\n They don't know what to do with Atlas Shrugged,\n\n41:37.140 --> 41:39.740\n but they're eager to get it out there.\n\n41:39.740 --> 41:41.340\n And indeed it, when it's published,\n\n41:41.340 --> 41:43.540\n it becomes an instant bestseller.\n\n41:43.540 --> 41:44.660\n And the thing about the,\n\n41:44.660 --> 41:46.500\n particularly The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged,\n\n41:46.500 --> 41:49.100\n but true of even Anthem and We the Living,\n\n41:49.100 --> 41:53.220\n she is one of the only dead authors\n\n41:53.220 --> 41:55.340\n that sell more after they've died\n\n41:55.340 --> 41:56.300\n than when they were still alive.\n\n41:56.300 --> 41:58.500\n Now, that's true maybe in music,\n\n41:58.500 --> 42:00.420\n we listen to more Beethoven than when he was alive,\n\n42:00.420 --> 42:02.980\n but it's not true typically of novelists.\n\n42:02.980 --> 42:04.380\n And yet here we are,\n\n42:06.940 --> 42:09.820\n was it 50, 60 years after,\n\n42:09.820 --> 42:13.020\n 63 years after the publication of Atlas Shrugged,\n\n42:13.020 --> 42:15.660\n and it sells probably more today than it sold\n\n42:15.660 --> 42:17.580\n when it was a bestseller when it first came out.\n\n42:17.580 --> 42:21.580\n Is it true that it's like one of the most sold books\n\n42:21.580 --> 42:22.420\n in history?\n\n42:22.420 --> 42:23.260\n No.\n\n42:23.260 --> 42:24.100\n Okay.\n\n42:24.100 --> 42:24.940\n I've heard this kind of statement.\n\n42:24.940 --> 42:27.180\n Any Tom Clancy book comes out,\n\n42:27.180 --> 42:28.580\n sells more than Atlas Shrugged.\n\n42:28.580 --> 42:30.780\n But I've read, I've heard statements like this.\n\n42:30.780 --> 42:32.820\n So there was a very,\n\n42:32.820 --> 42:34.620\n and I shouldn't say this, but it's the truth,\n\n42:34.620 --> 42:35.460\n so I'll say it,\n\n42:35.460 --> 42:40.460\n a very unscientific study done by the Smithsonian Institute,\n\n42:40.820 --> 42:42.700\n probably in the early 90s,\n\n42:42.700 --> 42:47.220\n that basically surveyed CEOs and asked them,\n\n42:47.220 --> 42:49.260\n what was the most influential book on you?\n\n42:50.180 --> 42:53.460\n And Atlas Shrugged came out as number two,\n\n42:53.460 --> 42:57.020\n the second most influential book on CEOs in the country.\n\n42:57.020 --> 42:58.700\n But there's so many flaws in the study.\n\n42:58.700 --> 43:01.460\n One was, you want to guess what the number one book?\n\n43:01.460 --> 43:02.300\n Bible.\n\n43:02.300 --> 43:03.140\n The Bible.\n\n43:03.140 --> 43:04.740\n But the Bible was like,\n\n43:05.740 --> 43:07.020\n so maybe they surveyed 100 people.\n\n43:07.020 --> 43:07.860\n I don't know what the exact numbers were,\n\n43:07.860 --> 43:09.860\n but let's say it's 100 people,\n\n43:09.860 --> 43:12.900\n and 60 said the Bible and 10 said Atlas Shrugged,\n\n43:12.900 --> 43:15.020\n and there were a bunch of books over there.\n\n43:15.020 --> 43:16.220\n So, I don't...\n\n43:16.220 --> 43:18.060\n That's, again, the psychology discussion\n\n43:18.060 --> 43:18.900\n what we're having right now.\n\n43:18.900 --> 43:21.580\n Exactly, well, and it's one thing I've learned,\n\n43:21.580 --> 43:23.580\n and maybe COVID has taught me,\n\n43:23.580 --> 43:27.020\n and there are very few people\n\n43:27.020 --> 43:29.540\n who know how to do statistics,\n\n43:29.540 --> 43:33.300\n and almost nobody knows how to think probabilistically,\n\n43:33.300 --> 43:35.500\n that is, think in terms of probabilities,\n\n43:35.500 --> 43:38.180\n that it is a skill, it's a hard skill,\n\n43:38.180 --> 43:39.580\n and everybody thinks they know it.\n\n43:39.580 --> 43:42.300\n So I see doctors thinking they're statisticians\n\n43:42.300 --> 43:45.340\n and giving whole analyses of the data on COVID,\n\n43:45.340 --> 43:46.940\n and they don't have a clue what they're talking about,\n\n43:46.940 --> 43:48.500\n not because they're not good doctors,\n\n43:48.500 --> 43:49.900\n but because they're not good statisticians.\n\n43:49.900 --> 43:50.740\n It's not...\n\n43:52.220 --> 43:53.620\n People think that they have one skill,\n\n43:53.620 --> 43:55.900\n and therefore it translates immediately into another skill,\n\n43:55.900 --> 43:57.220\n and it's just not true.\n\n43:58.780 --> 44:01.780\n So I've been astounded at how bad people are at that.\n\n44:03.580 --> 44:05.740\n For people who haven't read any of the books\n\n44:05.740 --> 44:07.180\n that we were just discussing,\n\n44:09.220 --> 44:11.420\n what would you recommend,\n\n44:11.420 --> 44:14.060\n what book would you recommend they read,\n\n44:14.060 --> 44:17.100\n and maybe also just elaborate\n\n44:17.100 --> 44:20.620\n what mindset should they enter\n\n44:20.620 --> 44:22.780\n the reading of that book with?\n\n44:22.780 --> 44:24.900\n So I would recommend everybody\n\n44:24.900 --> 44:26.900\n read Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged.\n\n44:26.900 --> 44:27.740\n And in one...\n\n44:27.740 --> 44:28.980\n In that order?\n\n44:28.980 --> 44:31.580\n So it would depend on where you are in life, right?\n\n44:31.580 --> 44:35.260\n So it depends on who you are and what you are.\n\n44:35.260 --> 44:38.180\n So Fountainhead is a more personal story.\n\n44:38.180 --> 44:39.660\n For many people, it's their favorite,\n\n44:39.660 --> 44:41.380\n and for many people, it was their first book,\n\n44:41.380 --> 44:43.980\n and they wouldn't replace that, right?\n\n44:46.900 --> 44:49.300\n Atlas Shrugged is a...\n\n44:49.300 --> 44:50.820\n It's about the world.\n\n44:50.820 --> 44:51.660\n Right.\n\n44:51.660 --> 44:54.020\n It's about what impacts the world,\n\n44:54.020 --> 44:55.540\n how the world functions,\n\n44:55.540 --> 44:59.180\n how it's a bigger book in the sense of the scope.\n\n44:59.180 --> 45:01.580\n If you're interested in politics\n\n45:01.580 --> 45:03.620\n and you're interested in the world,\n\n45:03.620 --> 45:05.460\n read Atlas Shrugged first.\n\n45:05.460 --> 45:08.100\n If you're mainly focused on your life, your career,\n\n45:08.100 --> 45:10.380\n what you wanna do with yourself, start with Fountainhead.\n\n45:10.380 --> 45:12.020\n I still think you should read both\n\n45:12.020 --> 45:13.940\n because I think they are...\n\n45:13.940 --> 45:16.620\n I mean, to me, they were life altering,\n\n45:16.620 --> 45:18.820\n and to many, many people, they're life altering,\n\n45:18.820 --> 45:21.820\n and you should go into reading them with an open mind,\n\n45:21.820 --> 45:24.500\n I'd say, and with a...\n\n45:24.500 --> 45:27.020\n Put aside everything you've heard about Ayn Rand.\n\n45:27.020 --> 45:28.740\n Put aside any...\n\n45:28.740 --> 45:30.540\n Even if it's true, just put it aside.\n\n45:30.540 --> 45:33.260\n Even what I just said about Ayn Rand, put it aside.\n\n45:33.260 --> 45:35.500\n Just read the book as a book,\n\n45:35.500 --> 45:39.580\n and let it move you and let your thoughts,\n\n45:39.580 --> 45:41.700\n let it shape how you think,\n\n45:43.500 --> 45:48.500\n and you'll either have a response to it or you won't,\n\n45:48.980 --> 45:52.140\n but I think most people have a very strong response to it,\n\n45:52.140 --> 45:53.820\n and then the question is,\n\n45:55.540 --> 45:57.260\n are they willing to respond to the philosophy?\n\n45:57.260 --> 45:58.700\n Are they willing to integrate the philosophy?\n\n45:58.700 --> 46:01.700\n Are they willing to think through the philosophy or not?\n\n46:01.700 --> 46:02.940\n Because I know a lot of people\n\n46:02.940 --> 46:06.340\n who completely disagree with the philosophy, right?\n\n46:06.340 --> 46:07.620\n Here in Hollywood, right?\n\n46:07.620 --> 46:09.340\n Lots of people here in Hollywood,\n\n46:09.340 --> 46:11.340\n love The Fountainhead.\n\n46:11.340 --> 46:12.180\n Interesting.\n\n46:12.180 --> 46:16.740\n Oliver Stone, who is, I think, a avowed Marxist, right?\n\n46:16.740 --> 46:19.660\n I think he's admitted to being a Marxist, he is.\n\n46:19.660 --> 46:23.180\n His movies certainly reflect a Marxist theme,\n\n46:24.700 --> 46:27.260\n is a huge fan of The Fountainhead,\n\n46:27.260 --> 46:30.380\n and is actually his dream project, he has said in public,\n\n46:30.380 --> 46:33.060\n his dream project is to make The Fountainhead.\n\n46:33.060 --> 46:37.500\n Now, he would completely change it, as movie directors do,\n\n46:37.500 --> 46:40.020\n and he's actually outlined what his script would look like,\n\n46:40.020 --> 46:43.460\n and it would be a disaster for the ideas of The Fountainhead,\n\n46:43.460 --> 46:44.620\n but he loves the story,\n\n46:44.620 --> 46:47.780\n because to him, the story is about artistic integrity.\n\n46:47.780 --> 46:48.980\n Ah, yeah.\n\n46:48.980 --> 46:50.180\n And that's what he catches on.\n\n46:50.180 --> 46:53.060\n And what he hates about the story is the individualism.\n\n46:53.060 --> 46:56.020\n And I think that his movie ends\n\n46:56.020 --> 46:58.620\n with Howard Rourke joining some kind of commune\n\n46:58.620 --> 47:00.660\n of architects that do it for the love\n\n47:00.660 --> 47:02.100\n and don't do it for the money.\n\n47:02.100 --> 47:02.940\n Interesting.\n\n47:02.940 --> 47:04.420\n But so, yeah, so he can connect with you\n\n47:04.420 --> 47:05.260\n without the philosophy,\n\n47:05.260 --> 47:07.460\n and before we get into the philosophy,\n\n47:07.460 --> 47:09.180\n staying on Ayn Rand,\n\n47:10.420 --> 47:12.780\n I'll tell you sort of my own personal experience,\n\n47:12.780 --> 47:15.140\n and I think it's one that people share.\n\n47:15.140 --> 47:18.140\n I've experienced this with two people, Ayn Rand and Nietzsche.\n\n47:19.540 --> 47:24.020\n When I brought up Ayn Rand when I was in my early 20s,\n\n47:24.020 --> 47:28.580\n the number of eye rolls I got from sort of, you know,\n\n47:28.580 --> 47:33.580\n like advisors and so on, that of dismissal,\n\n47:33.580 --> 47:37.260\n I've seen that later in life about more specific concepts\n\n47:37.260 --> 47:38.980\n in artificial intelligence and technical,\n\n47:38.980 --> 47:42.500\n where people decide that this is a set of ideas\n\n47:42.500 --> 47:45.380\n that are acceptable and these sets of ideas are not.\n\n47:45.380 --> 47:48.020\n And they dismissed Ayn Rand\n\n47:49.140 --> 47:52.100\n without giving me any justification\n\n47:52.100 --> 47:54.780\n of why they dismissed her,\n\n47:54.780 --> 47:57.980\n except, oh, that's something you're into\n\n47:57.980 --> 48:00.500\n when you're 19 or 20.\n\n48:00.500 --> 48:02.580\n That's the same thing people say about Nietzsche.\n\n48:02.580 --> 48:05.620\n Well, that's just something you do when you're in college\n\n48:05.620 --> 48:08.740\n and you take an intro to philosophy course.\n\n48:08.740 --> 48:13.740\n So, and I've never really heard anybody cleanly articulate\n\n48:15.460 --> 48:17.620\n their opposition to Ayn Rand,\n\n48:17.620 --> 48:20.420\n in my own private little circles and so on.\n\n48:20.420 --> 48:23.060\n Maybe one question I just wanna ask is,\n\n48:24.340 --> 48:27.820\n why is there such a opposition to Ayn Rand?\n\n48:27.820 --> 48:30.740\n And maybe another way to ask the same thing is,\n\n48:30.740 --> 48:35.100\n what's misunderstood about Ayn Rand?\n\n48:35.100 --> 48:37.380\n So, we haven't talked about the philosophy,\n\n48:37.380 --> 48:38.980\n so it's harder to answer right now.\n\n48:38.980 --> 48:40.140\n We can return to it if you think\n\n48:40.140 --> 48:41.380\n that's the right way to go.\n\n48:41.380 --> 48:43.300\n Well, let me give a broad answer\n\n48:43.300 --> 48:45.100\n and then we'll do the philosophy\n\n48:45.100 --> 48:45.940\n and then we'll return to it,\n\n48:45.940 --> 48:47.460\n because I think it's important to know\n\n48:47.460 --> 48:49.380\n something about her ideas.\n\n48:49.380 --> 48:54.380\n She, I think her philosophy challenges everything.\n\n48:55.540 --> 48:58.180\n It really does, it shakes up the world.\n\n48:58.180 --> 49:01.500\n It challenges so many of our preconceptions.\n\n49:01.500 --> 49:03.500\n It challenges so many of the things\n\n49:03.500 --> 49:06.420\n that people take for granted as truth.\n\n49:07.820 --> 49:10.580\n From religion to morality to politics\n\n49:10.580 --> 49:11.620\n to almost everything,\n\n49:11.620 --> 49:13.740\n there's never quite been a thinker like her\n\n49:13.740 --> 49:17.220\n in the sense of really challenging everything\n\n49:17.220 --> 49:18.540\n and doing it systematically\n\n49:18.540 --> 49:21.380\n and having a complete philosophy\n\n49:21.380 --> 49:23.980\n that is a challenge to everything that has come before her.\n\n49:23.980 --> 49:27.660\n Now, I'm not saying they're on threads that connect,\n\n49:27.660 --> 49:28.500\n they are, right?\n\n49:28.500 --> 49:30.100\n In politics, there might be a thread\n\n49:30.100 --> 49:31.740\n and in morality, there might be a thread,\n\n49:31.740 --> 49:34.820\n but on everything, there's just never been like it.\n\n49:34.820 --> 49:37.940\n And people are afraid of that\n\n49:37.940 --> 49:39.780\n because it challenges them to the core.\n\n49:39.780 --> 49:42.660\n She's basically telling you to rethink almost everything.\n\n49:44.580 --> 49:47.820\n And that is that people reject.\n\n49:47.820 --> 49:49.540\n The other thing that it does,\n\n49:49.540 --> 49:51.580\n and this goes to this point about,\n\n49:51.580 --> 49:54.260\n oh yeah, that's what you do when you're 14, 15, right?\n\n49:54.260 --> 49:55.580\n Yeah.\n\n49:55.580 --> 49:59.540\n She points out to them that they've lost something.\n\n50:00.540 --> 50:02.860\n They've lost their idealism.\n\n50:02.860 --> 50:05.940\n They've lost the youthful idealism.\n\n50:05.940 --> 50:09.980\n What makes youthfulness meaningful\n\n50:09.980 --> 50:13.340\n other than we're in better physical shape,\n\n50:13.340 --> 50:15.380\n starting to feel, because I'm getting older.\n\n50:16.660 --> 50:17.940\n When we're young,\n\n50:19.420 --> 50:21.420\n sometime in the teen years, right?\n\n50:21.420 --> 50:24.540\n There's something that happens to human consciousness.\n\n50:24.540 --> 50:27.260\n We almost awakened and knew, right?\n\n50:27.260 --> 50:30.780\n We suddenly discovered that we can think for ourselves.\n\n50:30.780 --> 50:33.860\n We suddenly discovered that not everything our parents\n\n50:33.860 --> 50:36.140\n and our teachers tell us is true.\n\n50:36.140 --> 50:39.460\n We suddenly discovered that this tool, our minds,\n\n50:39.460 --> 50:42.700\n is suddenly available to us to discover the world\n\n50:42.700 --> 50:44.660\n and to discover truth.\n\n50:44.660 --> 50:46.620\n And it is a time of idealism.\n\n50:46.620 --> 50:49.740\n It's a time of, whoa, I want to, you know,\n\n50:49.740 --> 50:52.260\n the better teenagers, I want to know about the world.\n\n50:52.260 --> 50:53.220\n I want to go out there.\n\n50:53.220 --> 50:54.340\n I don't believe my parents.\n\n50:54.340 --> 50:55.420\n I don't believe my teachers.\n\n50:55.420 --> 50:56.380\n And this is healthy.\n\n50:56.380 --> 50:57.940\n This is fantastic.\n\n50:57.940 --> 50:59.820\n And I want to go out there and experiment.\n\n50:59.820 --> 51:01.460\n And that gets us into trouble, right?\n\n51:01.460 --> 51:03.420\n We do stupid things when we're teenagers.\n\n51:03.420 --> 51:04.260\n Why?\n\n51:04.260 --> 51:05.100\n Because we're experimenting.\n\n51:05.100 --> 51:06.740\n It's the experiential part of it, right?\n\n51:06.740 --> 51:08.980\n We want to go and experience life.\n\n51:08.980 --> 51:09.980\n But we're learning.\n\n51:09.980 --> 51:11.420\n It's part of the learning process.\n\n51:11.420 --> 51:15.420\n And we become risk takers because we want to experience.\n\n51:15.420 --> 51:16.980\n But the risk is something we need to learn\n\n51:16.980 --> 51:19.340\n because we need to learn where the boundaries are.\n\n51:19.340 --> 51:21.780\n And one of the damages that helicopter parents do\n\n51:21.780 --> 51:23.180\n is they prevent us from taking those risks\n\n51:23.180 --> 51:24.380\n so we don't learn about the world\n\n51:24.380 --> 51:26.580\n and we don't learn about where the boundaries are.\n\n51:26.580 --> 51:30.420\n So the teenage years are these years of wonder.\n\n51:30.420 --> 51:32.740\n They're depressing when you're in them\n\n51:32.740 --> 51:33.740\n for a variety of reasons,\n\n51:33.740 --> 51:35.420\n which I think primarily have to do with the culture,\n\n51:35.420 --> 51:38.060\n but also with oneself.\n\n51:38.060 --> 51:41.980\n But they are exciting, the periods of discovery.\n\n51:41.980 --> 51:45.460\n And people get excited about ideas\n\n51:45.460 --> 51:48.660\n and good ideas, bad ideas, all kinds of ideas.\n\n51:48.660 --> 51:50.300\n And then what happens?\n\n51:50.300 --> 51:51.140\n We settle.\n\n51:51.140 --> 51:53.180\n We compromise.\n\n51:53.180 --> 51:55.220\n Whether that happens in college\n\n51:55.220 --> 51:57.580\n where we're taught that nothing exists and nothing matters\n\n51:57.580 --> 52:01.300\n and stop being an idealist, be a cynic, be whatever.\n\n52:01.300 --> 52:03.820\n Or whether it happens when we get married and get a job\n\n52:03.820 --> 52:05.140\n and have kids and are too busy\n\n52:05.140 --> 52:06.940\n and can't think about our ideals and forget\n\n52:06.940 --> 52:09.900\n and just get into the norm of conventional life\n\n52:09.900 --> 52:13.460\n or whether it's because a mother pesters us\n\n52:13.460 --> 52:14.500\n to get married and have kids\n\n52:14.500 --> 52:17.380\n and do all the things that she wanted us to do.\n\n52:17.380 --> 52:19.780\n We give up on those ideals.\n\n52:19.780 --> 52:24.780\n And there's a sense in which Ayn Rand reminds them\n\n52:24.820 --> 52:25.860\n that they gave up.\n\n52:25.860 --> 52:28.860\n That's beautifully, that's so beautifully put and so true.\n\n52:29.980 --> 52:34.260\n It's, it's worth pausing on,\n\n52:34.260 --> 52:38.500\n that this dismissal,\n\n52:38.500 --> 52:41.580\n people forget the beauty of that curiosity.\n\n52:41.580 --> 52:44.260\n That's true in the scientific field too,\n\n52:44.260 --> 52:49.260\n is that youthful joy of like everything is possible\n\n52:51.820 --> 52:56.180\n and we can understand it with the tools of our mind.\n\n52:56.180 --> 52:57.020\n Yes.\n\n52:57.020 --> 52:57.860\n And that's what it's all about.\n\n52:57.860 --> 52:58.900\n That's what Ayn Rand's ideas\n\n52:58.900 --> 53:00.340\n at the end of the day all boil down to,\n\n53:00.340 --> 53:02.500\n is that confidence and that passion\n\n53:02.500 --> 53:05.260\n and that curiosity and that interest.\n\n53:05.260 --> 53:08.820\n And if you think about what academia does\n\n53:08.820 --> 53:10.300\n to so many of us, right?\n\n53:10.300 --> 53:12.740\n We go into academia and we're excited about,\n\n53:12.740 --> 53:14.140\n we're gonna learn stuff.\n\n53:14.140 --> 53:16.220\n We're gonna discover things.\n\n53:16.220 --> 53:18.420\n And then they stick you into sub sub field\n\n53:18.420 --> 53:20.500\n and examining some minutia\n\n53:20.500 --> 53:22.820\n that's insignificant and unimportant.\n\n53:22.820 --> 53:25.580\n And to get published, you have to be conventional.\n\n53:25.580 --> 53:27.060\n You have to do what everybody else does.\n\n53:27.060 --> 53:29.660\n And then there's the tenure process of seven years\n\n53:29.660 --> 53:32.220\n where they put you through this torture to write papers\n\n53:32.220 --> 53:34.180\n that fit into a certain mold.\n\n53:34.180 --> 53:36.700\n And by the time you're done,\n\n53:36.700 --> 53:38.940\n you're in your mid thirties and you've done nothing.\n\n53:38.940 --> 53:39.900\n You discovered nothing.\n\n53:39.900 --> 53:43.020\n You're all in this minutia in this stuff\n\n53:43.020 --> 53:44.340\n and it's destructive.\n\n53:44.340 --> 53:48.100\n And where's holding onto that passion,\n\n53:48.100 --> 53:52.220\n holding onto that knowledge and that confidence is hard.\n\n53:52.220 --> 53:55.500\n And when people do away with it, they become cynical\n\n53:55.500 --> 53:57.340\n and they become part of the system\n\n53:57.340 --> 54:00.300\n and they inflict the same pain on the next guy\n\n54:00.300 --> 54:03.420\n that they suffered because that's part of how it works.\n\n54:03.420 --> 54:06.020\n Yeah, this happens in artificial intelligence.\n\n54:06.020 --> 54:08.940\n This happens when like a young person shows up\n\n54:08.940 --> 54:11.500\n and with like fire in their eyes and they say,\n\n54:11.500 --> 54:14.500\n I want to understand the nature of intelligence.\n\n54:14.500 --> 54:17.020\n And everybody rolls their eyes.\n\n54:18.100 --> 54:20.220\n Well, for these same reasons,\n\n54:20.220 --> 54:21.780\n because they've spent so many years\n\n54:21.780 --> 54:25.060\n on the very specific set of questions\n\n54:25.060 --> 54:30.060\n that kind of they compete over and they write papers over\n\n54:30.060 --> 54:31.660\n and they have conferences about.\n\n54:31.660 --> 54:34.020\n And it's true that incremental research\n\n54:34.020 --> 54:36.100\n is the way you make progress answering the question\n\n54:36.100 --> 54:38.820\n of what is intelligence exceptionally difficult.\n\n54:38.820 --> 54:43.820\n But when you mock it, you actually destroy the realities.\n\n54:45.340 --> 54:47.860\n When we look like centuries from now,\n\n54:47.860 --> 54:49.300\n we'll look back at this time\n\n54:49.300 --> 54:52.620\n for this particular field of artificial intelligence,\n\n54:52.620 --> 54:55.500\n it will be the people who will be remembered,\n\n54:55.500 --> 54:58.020\n will be the people who've asked the question\n\n54:58.020 --> 55:01.500\n and made it their life journey of what is intelligence\n\n55:01.500 --> 55:04.740\n and actually had the chance to succeed.\n\n55:04.740 --> 55:06.660\n Most will fail asking that question,\n\n55:06.660 --> 55:09.500\n but the ones that like had a chance of succeeding\n\n55:09.500 --> 55:11.820\n and had that throughout their whole life.\n\n55:12.700 --> 55:15.060\n And I suppose the same is true for philosophy.\n\n55:15.060 --> 55:16.060\n It's in every field.\n\n55:16.060 --> 55:20.140\n It's asking the big questions and staying curious\n\n55:20.140 --> 55:22.820\n and staying passionate and staying excited\n\n55:22.820 --> 55:26.100\n and accepting failure, right?\n\n55:26.100 --> 55:27.900\n Accepting that you're not going to get it first time.\n\n55:27.900 --> 55:29.580\n You're not going to get the whole thing.\n\n55:29.580 --> 55:31.860\n But, and sometimes you have to do the minutia work\n\n55:31.860 --> 55:34.300\n and I'm not here to say nobody should specialize\n\n55:34.300 --> 55:36.700\n and you shouldn't do the minutia, you have to do that.\n\n55:36.700 --> 55:38.820\n But there has to be a way to do that work\n\n55:38.820 --> 55:41.900\n and keep the passion and keep it all integrated.\n\n55:41.900 --> 55:42.740\n That's another thing.\n\n55:42.740 --> 55:46.420\n I mean, we don't live in a culture that integrates, right?\n\n55:46.420 --> 55:51.060\n We live in a culture that is all about this minutia\n\n55:51.060 --> 55:53.540\n and not, and medicine is another field\n\n55:53.540 --> 55:55.380\n where you specialize in the kidney.\n\n55:55.380 --> 55:57.060\n I mean, the kidney's connected to other things.\n\n55:57.060 --> 55:59.900\n You've got to, and we don't have a holistic view\n\n55:59.900 --> 56:02.220\n of these things and I'm sure in artificial intelligence,\n\n56:02.220 --> 56:04.980\n you're not going to make the big leaps forward\n\n56:04.980 --> 56:07.980\n without a holistic view of what it is\n\n56:07.980 --> 56:08.820\n you're trying to achieve.\n\n56:08.820 --> 56:10.700\n And maybe that's the question of what is intelligence?\n\n56:10.700 --> 56:14.260\n But that's the kind of questions you have to ask\n\n56:14.260 --> 56:17.340\n to make big leaps forward, to really move the field\n\n56:17.340 --> 56:19.300\n in a positive direction.\n\n56:19.300 --> 56:21.940\n And it's the people who can think that way,\n\n56:21.940 --> 56:24.060\n who move fields and move technology,\n\n56:24.060 --> 56:27.340\n who move anything, anything is, everything is like.\n\n56:27.340 --> 56:28.820\n But just like you said, it's painful\n\n56:28.820 --> 56:32.620\n because underlying that kind of questioning is,\n\n56:32.620 --> 56:35.300\n well, maybe the work I've done for the past 20 years\n\n56:35.300 --> 56:40.060\n was a dead end and you have to kind of face that.\n\n56:40.060 --> 56:42.060\n Even just, it might not be true,\n\n56:42.060 --> 56:45.820\n but even just facing that reality is just,\n\n56:45.820 --> 56:47.740\n it's a painful feeling.\n\n56:47.740 --> 56:50.540\n Absolutely, but it's, that's part of the reason\n\n56:50.540 --> 56:52.340\n why it's important to enjoy the work that you do.\n\n56:52.340 --> 56:53.180\n Right.\n\n56:53.180 --> 56:54.780\n So that even if it doesn't completely work out,\n\n56:54.780 --> 56:56.260\n at least you enjoy the process, right?\n\n56:56.260 --> 56:59.260\n It was not a waste because you enjoyed the process.\n\n56:59.260 --> 57:02.700\n And if you learn, as any entrepreneur knows this, right,\n\n57:02.700 --> 57:05.460\n and if you learn from the waste of time,\n\n57:05.460 --> 57:07.500\n from the errors, from the mistakes,\n\n57:07.500 --> 57:10.220\n then you can build on them and make things even better.\n\n57:10.220 --> 57:15.220\n Right, and so the next 20 years are a massive success.\n\n57:16.180 --> 57:18.780\n Can we, another impossible task,\n\n57:18.780 --> 57:22.580\n so you did wonderfully on talking about Ayn Rand,\n\n57:22.580 --> 57:25.900\n the other impossible task of giving a whirlwind overview\n\n57:25.900 --> 57:28.980\n of the philosophy of objectivism,\n\n57:28.980 --> 57:30.580\n the philosophy of Ayn Rand.\n\n57:30.580 --> 57:33.580\n Yeah, so luckily she did it in an essay.\n\n57:33.580 --> 57:35.900\n She talks about doing a philosophy on one foot.\n\n57:37.220 --> 57:39.500\n But let me integrate it with the literature\n\n57:39.500 --> 57:41.740\n and with her life a little bit.\n\n57:41.740 --> 57:45.460\n She wanted to be a writer, but her goal,\n\n57:45.460 --> 57:48.220\n she had a particular goal in her writing.\n\n57:48.220 --> 57:50.140\n She was an idealist, right?\n\n57:50.140 --> 57:52.620\n She wanted to portray the ideal man.\n\n57:52.620 --> 57:55.620\n So one of the things you do when you want to do something\n\n57:55.620 --> 57:56.460\n is what is an ideal man?\n\n57:56.460 --> 57:57.780\n You have to ask that question.\n\n57:57.780 --> 57:58.780\n What does that mean?\n\n57:58.780 --> 58:00.660\n You might have a sense of it.\n\n58:00.660 --> 58:03.940\n You might have some glimpses of it\n\n58:03.940 --> 58:06.380\n in other people's literature, but what is it?\n\n58:07.420 --> 58:09.660\n So she starts reading philosophy to try to figure out\n\n58:09.660 --> 58:11.860\n what do philosophers say about the ideal man?\n\n58:12.740 --> 58:14.540\n And what she finds horrifies her\n\n58:14.540 --> 58:16.660\n in terms of the view of most philosophers of man.\n\n58:16.660 --> 58:20.820\n And she's attracted, certainly when she's young,\n\n58:20.820 --> 58:24.660\n to Nietzsche, because Nietzsche at least has a vision\n\n58:24.660 --> 58:28.460\n of grandeur for man, even though his philosophy\n\n58:28.460 --> 58:30.060\n is very flawed and has other problems\n\n58:30.060 --> 58:32.100\n and contradicts man in many ways.\n\n58:32.100 --> 58:36.060\n But at least he has that vision of what is possible to man.\n\n58:36.060 --> 58:38.100\n And she's attracted to that romantic vision,\n\n58:38.100 --> 58:40.140\n that idealistic vision.\n\n58:40.140 --> 58:41.660\n So she discovers in writing,\n\n58:41.660 --> 58:43.020\n and particularly in writing Atlas Shrugged,\n\n58:43.020 --> 58:44.620\n but even in the Fountainhead,\n\n58:44.620 --> 58:47.340\n that she's gonna have to develop her own philosophy.\n\n58:47.340 --> 58:50.100\n She's gonna have to discover what she can do\n\n58:50.100 --> 58:52.740\n and she's gonna have to discover these ideas for herself,\n\n58:52.740 --> 58:55.820\n because they're not fully articulated anywhere else.\n\n58:55.820 --> 59:00.300\n The glimpses again of it in Aristotle, in Nietzsche,\n\n59:00.300 --> 59:02.020\n but they're not fully fleshed out.\n\n59:02.020 --> 59:05.780\n So to a large extent, she develops a philosophy\n\n59:05.780 --> 59:08.860\n for a very practical purpose, to write,\n\n59:08.860 --> 59:11.260\n to write a novel about the ideal man.\n\n59:11.260 --> 59:14.580\n And Atlas Shrugged is the manifestation of that.\n\n59:14.580 --> 59:18.940\n By the way, sorry to interrupt, as a little aside,\n\n59:18.940 --> 59:22.420\n she does, when you say man, you mean human.\n\n59:22.420 --> 59:26.300\n And because we'll bring this up often,\n\n59:26.300 --> 59:28.820\n she does, maybe you can elaborate\n\n59:28.820 --> 59:33.340\n of how she specifically uses man and he in the work.\n\n59:33.340 --> 59:36.220\n We live in a time now of gender and so on.\n\n59:36.220 --> 59:40.300\n Well, she did that in the sense that everybody did it\n\n59:40.300 --> 59:41.500\n during her period of time, right?\n\n59:41.500 --> 59:45.340\n It's only in modern times where we do he slash she, right?\n\n59:45.340 --> 59:48.580\n Historically, when you said he, you meant a human being,\n\n59:48.580 --> 59:51.580\n unless the particular context implied that it was a...\n\n59:51.580 --> 59:55.700\n But in Ayn Rand's case, in this case, in this one sentence,\n\n59:55.700 --> 59:57.340\n she probably meant man.\n\n59:58.780 --> 1:00:02.020\n Not that, because she viewed that there are differences\n\n1:00:02.020 --> 1:00:03.820\n between men and women, we're not the same,\n\n1:00:03.820 --> 1:00:06.020\n which I know comes at a shock to many people.\n\n1:00:06.020 --> 1:00:11.020\n But she...\n\n1:00:11.060 --> 1:00:12.340\n She's working on a character.\n\n1:00:12.340 --> 1:00:15.420\n She was working on a particular vision, right?\n\n1:00:15.420 --> 1:00:18.860\n She considered herself a man worshiper.\n\n1:00:18.860 --> 1:00:23.020\n And a man, not human being, a male.\n\n1:00:23.020 --> 1:00:28.020\n She worshiped manhood, if you will, the hero in man.\n\n1:00:28.540 --> 1:00:31.980\n And she wanted to fully understand what that was.\n\n1:00:31.980 --> 1:00:35.260\n Now, it has massive implications for ideal woman.\n\n1:00:35.260 --> 1:00:36.900\n And I think she does portray the ideal woman\n\n1:00:36.900 --> 1:00:40.780\n in Atlas Shrugged, in the character of Dagny.\n\n1:00:40.780 --> 1:00:45.780\n But her goal is, I think her selfish goal\n\n1:00:46.420 --> 1:00:49.140\n for what she wanted to get out of the novel\n\n1:00:49.140 --> 1:00:52.580\n is that excitement, partially sexual,\n\n1:00:52.580 --> 1:00:56.220\n about seeing your ideal manifest in reality\n\n1:00:56.220 --> 1:01:01.220\n of what you perceive as that which you would be attracted to\n\n1:01:02.300 --> 1:01:05.260\n fully, intellectually, physically, sexually,\n\n1:01:05.260 --> 1:01:06.580\n in every aspect of your life.\n\n1:01:06.580 --> 1:01:08.060\n That's what she's trying to bring into it.\n\n1:01:08.060 --> 1:01:11.340\n So there was no ambiguity of gender, so there was a masculinity\n\n1:01:11.340 --> 1:01:12.780\n and a femininity in her work.\n\n1:01:12.780 --> 1:01:14.300\n Very much so.\n\n1:01:14.300 --> 1:01:16.500\n And if you read the novels, you see that.\n\n1:01:16.500 --> 1:01:17.340\n You see that.\n\n1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:21.420\n Now, remember, this is in the context of, in Atlas Shrugged,\n\n1:01:21.420 --> 1:01:25.500\n she is portraying a woman who runs a railroad,\n\n1:01:25.500 --> 1:01:28.420\n the most masculine of all jobs you can imagine, right?\n\n1:01:28.420 --> 1:01:31.700\n Running a railroad, better than any man can run it.\n\n1:01:31.700 --> 1:01:33.380\n And achieving huge success,\n\n1:01:33.380 --> 1:01:35.780\n better than any other man out there.\n\n1:01:35.780 --> 1:01:40.780\n But, but for her, even Dagny needs somebody to,\n\n1:01:42.420 --> 1:01:47.300\n needs a man, in some sense, to look up to.\n\n1:01:47.300 --> 1:01:48.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:01:48.220 --> 1:01:51.340\n And that's the character whose name I won't mention\n\n1:01:51.340 --> 1:01:53.180\n because it gives away too much of the plot.\n\n1:01:53.180 --> 1:01:54.780\n But there has to be that.\n\n1:01:54.780 --> 1:01:55.820\n I like how you do that.\n\n1:01:55.820 --> 1:01:57.060\n You're good.\n\n1:01:57.060 --> 1:01:59.620\n You're not, a lot of practice, a lot of practice.\n\n1:01:59.620 --> 1:02:01.020\n Nothing, brilliant.\n\n1:02:01.020 --> 1:02:02.700\n Because you convey all the important things\n\n1:02:02.700 --> 1:02:04.500\n without giving away plot lines.\n\n1:02:04.500 --> 1:02:05.340\n That's beautiful.\n\n1:02:05.340 --> 1:02:06.180\n You're a master.\n\n1:02:06.180 --> 1:02:09.300\n So she's, so she's very much,\n\n1:02:09.300 --> 1:02:14.300\n she, she described herself once as a male chauvinist.\n\n1:02:15.340 --> 1:02:16.180\n Okay.\n\n1:02:16.180 --> 1:02:20.940\n She very, she likes the idea of a man opening a door for her.\n\n1:02:20.940 --> 1:02:25.940\n But more metaphysically, she identifies something\n\n1:02:25.940 --> 1:02:28.980\n in the difference between the way a man relates to a woman\n\n1:02:28.980 --> 1:02:30.180\n and a woman relates to a man.\n\n1:02:30.180 --> 1:02:32.100\n It's not the same.\n\n1:02:32.100 --> 1:02:35.300\n And let's not take too far of a tangent,\n\n1:02:35.300 --> 1:02:40.300\n but I just, as a side comment, I, to me, she represented,\n\n1:02:41.260 --> 1:02:43.140\n she was a feminist to me.\n\n1:02:43.140 --> 1:02:45.740\n Perhaps there's a, perhaps technically,\n\n1:02:45.740 --> 1:02:47.540\n philosophy, you disagree with that, whatever.\n\n1:02:47.540 --> 1:02:52.540\n But the, you know, that to me represented strong,\n\n1:02:52.620 --> 1:02:55.380\n like she had some of the strongest female characters\n\n1:02:55.380 --> 1:02:56.780\n in the history of literature.\n\n1:02:56.780 --> 1:03:00.180\n Again, this is, this is a woman running a railroad in 1957.\n\n1:03:00.180 --> 1:03:01.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:01.020 --> 1:03:02.620\n And not just a woman running a railroad,\n\n1:03:02.620 --> 1:03:05.020\n and this is true of the Fountainhead as well.\n\n1:03:05.020 --> 1:03:09.740\n A woman who is sexually, in a sense, assertive,\n\n1:03:09.740 --> 1:03:11.220\n sexually open.\n\n1:03:13.540 --> 1:03:15.700\n This is, this is not a woman who, you know,\n\n1:03:15.700 --> 1:03:20.380\n this is a woman who, who, who embraces her sexuality.\n\n1:03:20.380 --> 1:03:22.740\n And, you know, sex is important in life.\n\n1:03:22.740 --> 1:03:24.540\n This is why it keeps coming up, right?\n\n1:03:24.540 --> 1:03:25.900\n It's, it was important to Ayn Rand.\n\n1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:27.380\n It was, it's important in the novels.\n\n1:03:27.380 --> 1:03:28.940\n It's important in life.\n\n1:03:28.940 --> 1:03:32.340\n And for her, one's attitude towards sex\n\n1:03:32.340 --> 1:03:34.460\n is a reflection of one's attitude towards life.\n\n1:03:34.460 --> 1:03:36.700\n And it, you know, and what attitude towards pleasure,\n\n1:03:36.700 --> 1:03:38.380\n which is an important part of life.\n\n1:03:38.380 --> 1:03:41.900\n And she thought that was an incredibly important thing.\n\n1:03:41.900 --> 1:03:46.900\n And so she has these assertive, powerful, sexual women\n\n1:03:48.900 --> 1:03:53.900\n who live their lives on their terms 100%,\n\n1:03:54.100 --> 1:03:56.940\n who seek a man to look up to.\n\n1:03:56.940 --> 1:03:57.780\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:57.780 --> 1:04:00.660\n It's not, it is psychologically complex.\n\n1:04:00.660 --> 1:04:02.300\n It's more psychology than philosophy, right?\n\n1:04:02.300 --> 1:04:05.100\n It's psychologically complex and, you know,\n\n1:04:05.100 --> 1:04:07.700\n not my area of expertise, but this is,\n\n1:04:07.700 --> 1:04:10.420\n there's something in, she would argue,\n\n1:04:10.420 --> 1:04:12.780\n there's something fundamentally different\n\n1:04:12.780 --> 1:04:16.140\n about a male and a woman, about a male and female,\n\n1:04:16.140 --> 1:04:18.820\n psychologically in their attitude towards one another.\n\n1:04:18.820 --> 1:04:21.980\n Yeah, but as a side note, I say that,\n\n1:04:21.980 --> 1:04:25.500\n I would say that, I don't know philosophically\n\n1:04:25.500 --> 1:04:28.940\n if her ideas about gender are interesting.\n\n1:04:28.940 --> 1:04:30.740\n I think her other philosophical ideas\n\n1:04:30.740 --> 1:04:32.300\n are much more interesting.\n\n1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:36.180\n But reading wise, like the stories it created,\n\n1:04:36.180 --> 1:04:39.460\n the tension it created, that was pretty powerful.\n\n1:04:39.460 --> 1:04:43.300\n I mean, that was, that's pretty powerful stuff.\n\n1:04:43.300 --> 1:04:45.660\n I'll speculate that the reason it's so powerful\n\n1:04:45.660 --> 1:04:47.380\n is because it reflects something in reality.\n\n1:04:47.380 --> 1:04:48.660\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n1:04:48.660 --> 1:04:50.140\n There's a thread that at least.\n\n1:04:50.140 --> 1:04:53.380\n And look, it's really important to say,\n\n1:04:53.380 --> 1:04:56.340\n I think she was the first feminist in a sense.\n\n1:04:56.340 --> 1:04:57.900\n I think in a sense, the feminists have\n\n1:04:57.900 --> 1:05:00.780\n promoted feminism into something that it shouldn't be.\n\n1:05:00.780 --> 1:05:04.180\n But in the sense of men and women are capable,\n\n1:05:05.980 --> 1:05:08.580\n she was the first one who really put that\n\n1:05:08.580 --> 1:05:10.660\n into a novel and showed it.\n\n1:05:10.660 --> 1:05:15.540\n To me, as a boy, when I was reading Alice Shrugged,\n\n1:05:15.540 --> 1:05:18.180\n I think I read that before Fountainhead,\n\n1:05:18.180 --> 1:05:20.460\n that was one of the early introductions,\n\n1:05:20.460 --> 1:05:21.820\n at least of an American woman,\n\n1:05:21.820 --> 1:05:24.180\n I had examples of my own life of Russian women,\n\n1:05:24.180 --> 1:05:26.900\n but of like a badass lady.\n\n1:05:26.900 --> 1:05:30.180\n Like I admire, like I love engineering.\n\n1:05:30.180 --> 1:05:32.380\n I had loved that she could, you know,\n\n1:05:32.380 --> 1:05:34.340\n here's a lady that's running the show.\n\n1:05:34.340 --> 1:05:36.660\n So that at least to me was an example\n\n1:05:36.660 --> 1:05:38.980\n of a really strong woman, but objectivism.\n\n1:05:38.980 --> 1:05:39.820\n Objectivism.\n\n1:05:39.820 --> 1:05:42.020\n So, and so she developed it for a novel.\n\n1:05:42.020 --> 1:05:43.980\n She spent the latter part of her life\n\n1:05:43.980 --> 1:05:45.380\n after the publication of Alice Shrugged\n\n1:05:45.380 --> 1:05:46.820\n really articulating her philosophy.\n\n1:05:46.820 --> 1:05:47.740\n So that's what she did.\n\n1:05:47.740 --> 1:05:50.780\n She applied it to politics, to life, to gender,\n\n1:05:50.780 --> 1:05:54.260\n to all these issues from 1957 until she died in 1982.\n\n1:05:54.260 --> 1:05:56.100\n So the objectivism was born\n\n1:05:56.100 --> 1:05:57.900\n out of the later parts of Alice Shrugged.\n\n1:05:57.900 --> 1:05:59.300\n Yes, definitely.\n\n1:05:59.300 --> 1:06:00.460\n It was there all the time,\n\n1:06:00.460 --> 1:06:02.940\n but it was fleshed out during the latter parts\n\n1:06:02.940 --> 1:06:04.340\n of Alice Shrugged and then articulated\n\n1:06:04.340 --> 1:06:05.180\n for the next 20 years.\n\n1:06:05.180 --> 1:06:06.660\n So what is objectivism?\n\n1:06:06.660 --> 1:06:09.900\n So objectivism, so there are five branches in philosophy.\n\n1:06:09.900 --> 1:06:13.180\n And so I'm gonna just go through the branches.\n\n1:06:13.180 --> 1:06:15.060\n She starts with, you start with metaphysics,\n\n1:06:15.060 --> 1:06:16.780\n the nature of reality.\n\n1:06:16.780 --> 1:06:20.220\n And objectivism argues that reality is what it is.\n\n1:06:20.220 --> 1:06:22.820\n It's kind of goes Hawkins back to Aristotle,\n\n1:06:22.820 --> 1:06:24.900\n law of identity, A is A.\n\n1:06:24.900 --> 1:06:27.020\n You can wish it to be B,\n\n1:06:27.020 --> 1:06:29.460\n but wishes do not make something real.\n\n1:06:29.460 --> 1:06:32.620\n Reality is what it is and it is the primary.\n\n1:06:32.620 --> 1:06:37.420\n And it's not manipulated, directed by consciousness.\n\n1:06:37.420 --> 1:06:40.420\n Consciousness is there to observe,\n\n1:06:42.980 --> 1:06:45.900\n to give us information about reality.\n\n1:06:45.900 --> 1:06:48.220\n That is the purpose of consciousness.\n\n1:06:48.220 --> 1:06:50.340\n That is the nature of it.\n\n1:06:50.340 --> 1:06:54.580\n So in metaphysics, existence exists.\n\n1:06:54.580 --> 1:06:57.180\n The law of identity, the law of causality,\n\n1:06:57.180 --> 1:07:01.100\n things act based on their nature,\n\n1:07:01.100 --> 1:07:05.420\n not randomly, not arbitrarily, but based on their nature.\n\n1:07:05.420 --> 1:07:08.420\n And then we have the tool to know reality.\n\n1:07:08.420 --> 1:07:11.420\n This is epistemology, the theory of knowledge.\n\n1:07:11.420 --> 1:07:14.340\n A tool to know reality is reason.\n\n1:07:14.340 --> 1:07:16.620\n It's our senses and our capacity\n\n1:07:16.620 --> 1:07:19.140\n to integrate the information we get from our senses\n\n1:07:19.140 --> 1:07:20.700\n and to integrate it into new knowledge\n\n1:07:20.700 --> 1:07:22.580\n and to conceptualize it.\n\n1:07:22.580 --> 1:07:25.220\n And that is uniquely human.\n\n1:07:26.420 --> 1:07:31.220\n We don't know the truth from revelation.\n\n1:07:32.100 --> 1:07:35.220\n We don't know truth from our emotions.\n\n1:07:35.220 --> 1:07:36.900\n Our emotions are interesting.\n\n1:07:36.900 --> 1:07:39.540\n Our emotions tell us something about ourselves,\n\n1:07:39.540 --> 1:07:42.380\n but our emotions are not tools of cognition.\n\n1:07:42.380 --> 1:07:45.180\n They don't tell us the truth about what's out there,\n\n1:07:45.180 --> 1:07:47.660\n about what's in reality.\n\n1:07:47.660 --> 1:07:50.860\n So reason is our means of knowledge\n\n1:07:50.860 --> 1:07:53.340\n and therefore reason is our means of survival.\n\n1:07:54.340 --> 1:07:56.180\n Only individuals reason,\n\n1:07:56.180 --> 1:07:59.140\n just in the same way that only individuals can eat.\n\n1:07:59.140 --> 1:08:00.900\n We don't have a collective stomach.\n\n1:08:00.900 --> 1:08:05.700\n Nobody can eat for me and therefore nobody can think for me.\n\n1:08:05.700 --> 1:08:07.260\n We don't have a collective mind.\n\n1:08:07.260 --> 1:08:09.420\n There's no collective consciousness.\n\n1:08:09.420 --> 1:08:11.780\n It's bizarre that people talk about\n\n1:08:11.780 --> 1:08:14.980\n these collectivized aspects of the mind.\n\n1:08:14.980 --> 1:08:16.700\n They don't talk about collective feet\n\n1:08:16.700 --> 1:08:18.780\n and collective stomachs and collective things.\n\n1:08:18.780 --> 1:08:21.780\n But so we all think for ourselves\n\n1:08:21.780 --> 1:08:25.340\n and it is our fundamental basic responsibility\n\n1:08:25.340 --> 1:08:29.900\n to live our lives, to live, to choose.\n\n1:08:29.900 --> 1:08:32.740\n Once we choose to live, to live our lives\n\n1:08:32.740 --> 1:08:34.140\n to the best of our ability.\n\n1:08:35.140 --> 1:08:38.060\n So in morality, she is an egoist.\n\n1:08:38.060 --> 1:08:40.420\n She believes that the purpose of morality\n\n1:08:40.420 --> 1:08:43.540\n is to provide you with a code of values and virtues\n\n1:08:43.540 --> 1:08:47.780\n to guide your life for the purpose of your own success,\n\n1:08:47.780 --> 1:08:51.100\n your own survival, your own thriving, your own happiness.\n\n1:08:51.100 --> 1:08:54.300\n Happiness is the moral purpose of your life.\n\n1:08:54.300 --> 1:08:57.700\n The purpose of morality is to guide you towards a happy life.\n\n1:08:57.700 --> 1:08:58.740\n Your own happiness.\n\n1:08:58.740 --> 1:09:00.540\n Your own happiness, absolutely.\n\n1:09:00.540 --> 1:09:01.820\n Your own happiness.\n\n1:09:01.820 --> 1:09:03.140\n So she rejects the idea\n\n1:09:03.140 --> 1:09:04.860\n that you should live other people.\n\n1:09:04.860 --> 1:09:06.140\n That you should live for the purpose\n\n1:09:06.140 --> 1:09:07.740\n of other people's happiness.\n\n1:09:07.740 --> 1:09:09.340\n Your purpose is not to make them happier,\n\n1:09:09.340 --> 1:09:10.220\n to make them anything.\n\n1:09:10.220 --> 1:09:12.020\n Your purpose is your own happiness.\n\n1:09:12.020 --> 1:09:14.520\n But she also rejects the idea\n\n1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:18.040\n that you could argue maybe the Nietzschean idea\n\n1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:22.080\n of you should use other people for your own purposes, right?\n\n1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:24.440\n So every person is an end in himself.\n\n1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:28.160\n Every person's moral responsibility is their own happiness.\n\n1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:30.120\n And you shouldn't use other people for your own,\n\n1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:32.040\n shouldn't exploit other people for your own happiness,\n\n1:09:32.040 --> 1:09:33.300\n and you shouldn't allow yourself\n\n1:09:33.300 --> 1:09:34.960\n to be exploited for other people.\n\n1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:37.260\n Every individual is responsible for themselves.\n\n1:09:38.740 --> 1:09:40.800\n And what is it that allows us to be happy?\n\n1:09:40.800 --> 1:09:44.680\n What is it that facilitates human flourishing,\n\n1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:46.960\n human success, human survival?\n\n1:09:46.960 --> 1:09:49.000\n Well, it's the use of our minds, right?\n\n1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:50.340\n It goes back to reason.\n\n1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:56.140\n And what does reason require in order to be successful,\n\n1:09:56.140 --> 1:09:58.600\n in order to work effectively?\n\n1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:02.200\n It requires freedom.\n\n1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:07.000\n So the enemy of reason, the enemy of reason is force.\n\n1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.120\n The enemy of reason is coercion.\n\n1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:12.840\n The enemy of reason is authority, right?\n\n1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:16.800\n The Catholic church doing what they did to Galileo, right?\n\n1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:19.160\n That restricts Galileo's thinking, right?\n\n1:10:19.160 --> 1:10:20.400\n When he's in house arrest,\n\n1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:21.640\n is he gonna come up with a new theory?\n\n1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:23.720\n Is he gonna discover new truths?\n\n1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:28.720\n No, the punishment is too, you know, it's too dangerous.\n\n1:10:29.140 --> 1:10:34.140\n So force, coercion are enemies of reason.\n\n1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:39.060\n And what reason needs is to be free,\n\n1:10:39.060 --> 1:10:42.680\n to think, to discover, to innovate,\n\n1:10:42.680 --> 1:10:44.660\n to break out of convention.\n\n1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:48.680\n So we need to create an environment\n\n1:10:48.680 --> 1:10:52.400\n in which individuals are free to reason, free to think.\n\n1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:55.640\n And to do that, we come up with a concept,\n\n1:10:55.640 --> 1:10:57.200\n historically we've come up with a concept\n\n1:10:57.200 --> 1:10:58.760\n of individual rights.\n\n1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:01.520\n Individual rights define the scope of,\n\n1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:05.540\n define the fact that we should be left alone,\n\n1:11:05.540 --> 1:11:09.400\n free to pursue our values, using our reason,\n\n1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:10.240\n free of what?\n\n1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:12.400\n Free of coercion, force, authority.\n\n1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:14.840\n And that the job of government\n\n1:11:14.840 --> 1:11:17.180\n is to make sure that we are free.\n\n1:11:17.180 --> 1:11:18.400\n The whole point of government,\n\n1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:21.680\n the whole point of when we come in a social context,\n\n1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:25.540\n the whole point of establish a government in that context\n\n1:11:25.540 --> 1:11:30.040\n is to secure that freedom.\n\n1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:34.640\n It's to make sure that I don't use coercion on you.\n\n1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:36.040\n The government is supposed to stop me,\n\n1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:38.080\n supposed to intervene before I can do that,\n\n1:11:38.080 --> 1:11:40.440\n or if I've already done it,\n\n1:11:40.440 --> 1:11:42.680\n to prevent me from doing it again.\n\n1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:47.040\n So the purpose of government is to protect our freedom\n\n1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:49.940\n to think and to act based on our thoughts.\n\n1:11:49.940 --> 1:11:53.380\n It's to leave individuals free to pursue their values,\n\n1:11:53.380 --> 1:11:58.380\n to pursue their happiness, to pursue their rational thought,\n\n1:11:59.100 --> 1:12:01.560\n and to be left alone to do it.\n\n1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:06.480\n And so she rejects socialism, which basically assumes\n\n1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:07.800\n some kind of collective goal,\n\n1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:11.000\n assumes the sacrifice of the individual to the group,\n\n1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.080\n assumes that your moral purpose in life\n\n1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:15.800\n is the well being of other people rather than your own.\n\n1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:20.560\n And she rejects all form of statism,\n\n1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:25.000\n all form of government that is overly,\n\n1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:28.680\n that is involved in any aspect\n\n1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:32.580\n other than to protect us from forced coercion authority.\n\n1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:36.600\n And she rejects anarchy, and we can talk about that.\n\n1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:39.480\n I think you had a question in the list of questions\n\n1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:41.040\n you sent me about anarchy.\n\n1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:41.880\n And I'm happy to discuss that.\n\n1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:43.480\n I just talked to Michael Malice about anarchy,\n\n1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:45.720\n so I don't know if you're familiar with him.\n\n1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:46.760\n Yes, I'm familiar with him.\n\n1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:49.840\n So yeah, so she would completely reject anarchy.\n\n1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:52.440\n Anarchy is completely inconsistent with her point of view,\n\n1:12:52.440 --> 1:12:54.120\n and we can talk about why if you want.\n\n1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:57.200\n So there is some perfect place where freedom is maximized,\n\n1:12:57.200 --> 1:12:58.920\n so systems of government and that.\n\n1:12:58.920 --> 1:12:59.760\n Absolutely.\n\n1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:01.560\n And she thought that the American system of government\n\n1:13:01.560 --> 1:13:04.080\n came close in its idea,\n\n1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:08.460\n obviously founded with original sin, with the sin of slavery,\n\n1:13:08.460 --> 1:13:11.320\n but in its conception, the Declaration of Independence\n\n1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:14.620\n is about as perfect a political document as one could write.\n\n1:13:14.620 --> 1:13:17.080\n I think the greatest political document in human history,\n\n1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:21.920\n but really articulated almost perfectly and beautifully.\n\n1:13:21.920 --> 1:13:23.160\n And that the American system of government\n\n1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:25.120\n with the checks as balances,\n\n1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:27.540\n which is with its emphasis on individual rights,\n\n1:13:27.540 --> 1:13:29.440\n with its emphasis on freedom,\n\n1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:32.200\n with its emphasis on leaving individual freedom\n\n1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:33.360\n to pursue their happiness,\n\n1:13:33.360 --> 1:13:36.600\n an explicit recognition of happiness as a goal,\n\n1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:39.200\n individual happiness, was the model.\n\n1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:40.480\n It wasn't perfect.\n\n1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:42.280\n There are a lot of problems to a large extent\n\n1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:45.400\n because the founders had mixed philosophical premises.\n\n1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:50.400\n So there were alien premises introduced\n\n1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:52.220\n into the founding of the country,\n\n1:13:52.220 --> 1:13:55.040\n slavery obviously being the biggest problem.\n\n1:13:55.040 --> 1:13:56.840\n But it was close.\n\n1:13:56.840 --> 1:13:59.000\n And we need to build on that\n\n1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.240\n to create an ideal political system\n\n1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:06.200\n that will, yes, maximize the freedom of individuals\n\n1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:07.340\n to do exactly this.\n\n1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:10.640\n And then of course she had,\n\n1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:12.320\n so that's kind of,\n\n1:14:12.320 --> 1:14:15.400\n that's the manifestation of this individualism\n\n1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:16.720\n in a political realm.\n\n1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:18.000\n And she had a theory of art.\n\n1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:19.520\n She had a theory of aesthetics,\n\n1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:21.560\n which is the fifth branch of,\n\n1:14:21.560 --> 1:14:25.040\n she have metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and politics.\n\n1:14:25.040 --> 1:14:26.840\n And the fifth branch is aesthetics.\n\n1:14:26.840 --> 1:14:31.680\n And she viewed art as an essential human need,\n\n1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:34.120\n a fuel for the human spirit.\n\n1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:36.200\n And that just like any human need,\n\n1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:40.160\n it had certain principles that it had to abide by.\n\n1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:42.720\n That is just like there's nutrition, right?\n\n1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:43.960\n So some food is good for you\n\n1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:45.120\n and some food is bad for you.\n\n1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:47.720\n Some food, some stuff is poison.\n\n1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:49.600\n She believed the same is true of art,\n\n1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:51.600\n that art had an identity,\n\n1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:53.840\n which is very controversial today, right?\n\n1:14:53.840 --> 1:14:57.240\n If you put a frame around it, it is art, right?\n\n1:14:57.240 --> 1:15:01.080\n If you put a urinal in a museum, it becomes art,\n\n1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:05.040\n which she thought was evil and ludicrous,\n\n1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:07.120\n and she rejected completely.\n\n1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:09.080\n That art had an identity\n\n1:15:09.080 --> 1:15:11.400\n and that it served a certain function\n\n1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:13.560\n that human beings needed it.\n\n1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:15.160\n And if it didn't have,\n\n1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:17.160\n not only did it have the identity,\n\n1:15:17.160 --> 1:15:20.040\n but that function was served well by some art\n\n1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:21.400\n and poorly by other art.\n\n1:15:22.600 --> 1:15:24.840\n And then there's a whole realm of stuff that's not art.\n\n1:15:24.840 --> 1:15:28.680\n Basically, all of what today is considered modern art,\n\n1:15:28.680 --> 1:15:31.280\n she would consider as not being art.\n\n1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:34.040\n Splashing paint on a canvas, not art.\n\n1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:40.080\n So she had very clear ideas.\n\n1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:42.480\n She articulated them not,\n\n1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:46.280\n so I would say not in conventional philosophical form.\n\n1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:49.160\n So she didn't write philosophical essays\n\n1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:51.800\n using the philosopher's language.\n\n1:15:51.800 --> 1:15:54.400\n It's why, partially why I think philosophers\n\n1:15:54.400 --> 1:15:56.080\n have never taken it seriously.\n\n1:15:56.080 --> 1:15:58.280\n They're actually accessible to us.\n\n1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:00.360\n We can actually read them.\n\n1:16:00.360 --> 1:16:02.920\n And she integrates the philosophy\n\n1:16:02.920 --> 1:16:06.040\n in what I think are amazing ways with psychology,\n\n1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:09.480\n with history, with economics, with politics,\n\n1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:11.440\n with what's going on in the world.\n\n1:16:11.440 --> 1:16:14.640\n And she has dozens and dozens and dozens of essays\n\n1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:16.240\n that she wrote.\n\n1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:19.760\n Many of them were aggregated into books.\n\n1:16:19.760 --> 1:16:21.640\n I particularly recommend books like\n\n1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:25.160\n The Virtue of Selfishness,\n\n1:16:25.160 --> 1:16:27.360\n Capitalism, The Unknown Ideal,\n\n1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:32.120\n and Philosophy Who Needs It.\n\n1:16:32.120 --> 1:16:37.120\n And I think it's a beautiful philosophy.\n\n1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:38.960\n I know you're big on love.\n\n1:16:38.960 --> 1:16:41.600\n I think it's the philosophy of love.\n\n1:16:41.600 --> 1:16:42.600\n We can talk about that.\n\n1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:44.120\n Essentially, it's about love.\n\n1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:45.640\n That's what the philosophy is all about\n\n1:16:45.640 --> 1:16:48.120\n in terms of it applying to self.\n\n1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:54.120\n And I think it's sad that so few people read it\n\n1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:57.400\n and so few intellectuals take it seriously\n\n1:16:57.400 --> 1:16:58.720\n and are willing to engage with it.\n\n1:16:58.720 --> 1:17:01.960\n Let me ask, that was incredible.\n\n1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:04.280\n But after that beautiful whirlwind overview,\n\n1:17:04.280 --> 1:17:06.240\n let me ask the most shallow of questions,\n\n1:17:06.240 --> 1:17:09.400\n which is the name Objectivism.\n\n1:17:12.840 --> 1:17:16.600\n How should people think about the name being rooted?\n\n1:17:16.600 --> 1:17:18.120\n Why not individualism?\n\n1:17:18.120 --> 1:17:19.280\n What are the options?\n\n1:17:19.280 --> 1:17:21.200\n If we had a branding meeting right now.\n\n1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:22.040\n Sure.\n\n1:17:22.040 --> 1:17:23.880\n So she actually had a branding meeting.\n\n1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:24.920\n So she did this.\n\n1:17:24.920 --> 1:17:25.960\n She went through the exercise.\n\n1:17:25.960 --> 1:17:27.640\n Objectivism, I do not think,\n\n1:17:27.640 --> 1:17:28.880\n I don't know all the details,\n\n1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:32.000\n but I don't think Objectivism was the first name\n\n1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:32.840\n she came with.\n\n1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:35.280\n The problem was that the other names were taken\n\n1:17:35.280 --> 1:17:38.240\n and they were not positive implications.\n\n1:17:38.240 --> 1:17:41.240\n So for example, rationalism could have been a good word\n\n1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:45.200\n because she's an advocate of rational thought or reasonism,\n\n1:17:45.200 --> 1:17:47.320\n but reasonism sounds weird, right?\n\n1:17:47.320 --> 1:17:50.080\n The ism because of too many Ss, I guess.\n\n1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:52.920\n Rationalism, but it was already a philosophy\n\n1:17:52.920 --> 1:17:55.440\n and it was a philosophy inconsistent with hers\n\n1:17:55.440 --> 1:17:59.040\n because it was what she considered a false view\n\n1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:01.080\n of reason, of rationality.\n\n1:18:01.080 --> 1:18:04.440\n Reality ism, you know, just doesn't work.\n\n1:18:04.440 --> 1:18:06.320\n So she came on Objectivism.\n\n1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:10.120\n And I think actually, it's a great word.\n\n1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:15.120\n It's a great name because it has two aspects to it.\n\n1:18:15.400 --> 1:18:16.440\n And this is a unique view\n\n1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:18.400\n of what objectivity actually means.\n\n1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:22.360\n In Objectivism, in objectivity is the idea\n\n1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:24.760\n of an independent reality.\n\n1:18:24.760 --> 1:18:26.080\n There is truth.\n\n1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:28.640\n There's actually something out there that we,\n\n1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:32.440\n and then there's the role of consciousness, right?\n\n1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:36.160\n There is the role of figuring out the truth.\n\n1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:39.120\n The truth doesn't just hit you.\n\n1:18:40.040 --> 1:18:42.880\n The truth is not in the thing.\n\n1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:44.440\n You have to discover it.\n\n1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:48.160\n It's that a consciousness applied to,\n\n1:18:49.560 --> 1:18:51.880\n that's what objectivity is, right?\n\n1:18:51.880 --> 1:18:55.880\n It's you discovering the truth in reality.\n\n1:18:55.880 --> 1:18:57.320\n It's your consciousness.\n\n1:18:57.320 --> 1:19:00.160\n It's your consciousness interacting.\n\n1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:02.600\n And thereby posing the individual in that sense.\n\n1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:03.800\n And only the individual could do it.\n\n1:19:03.800 --> 1:19:06.160\n Now, the problem with individualism\n\n1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:09.960\n is it would have made the philosophy too political.\n\n1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:10.880\n Right.\n\n1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:13.760\n And she always said, so she said,\n\n1:19:13.760 --> 1:19:15.640\n she said, I'm an advocate of capitalism\n\n1:19:16.600 --> 1:19:19.400\n because I'm really an advocate for rational egoism.\n\n1:19:20.360 --> 1:19:23.640\n But I'm a advocate for rational egoism\n\n1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:26.040\n really because I'm an advocate for reason.\n\n1:19:26.040 --> 1:19:28.960\n So she viewed the essential of her philosophy\n\n1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:33.960\n as being this reason and her particular view of reason.\n\n1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:35.640\n And she has a whole book.\n\n1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:36.680\n She has a book called\n\n1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:39.400\n Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology,\n\n1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:42.120\n which I encourage any scientist, mathematician,\n\n1:19:42.120 --> 1:19:43.720\n anybody interested in science to read\n\n1:19:43.720 --> 1:19:46.480\n because it is a tour de force on,\n\n1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:52.960\n in a sense, what it means to hold concepts\n\n1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:56.880\n and what it means to discover new discoveries\n\n1:19:56.880 --> 1:20:01.880\n and to use concepts and how we use concepts.\n\n1:20:03.160 --> 1:20:08.160\n And she has a theory of concepts that is completely new,\n\n1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:11.200\n that is completely revolutionary.\n\n1:20:11.200 --> 1:20:14.320\n And I think is essential for the philosophy of science.\n\n1:20:14.320 --> 1:20:16.000\n And therefore, ultimately,\n\n1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:18.800\n the more abstract we get with scientific discoveries,\n\n1:20:18.800 --> 1:20:22.160\n the easier it is to detach them from reality\n\n1:20:22.160 --> 1:20:24.320\n and to detach them from truth,\n\n1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:26.720\n the easier it is to be inside our heads\n\n1:20:26.720 --> 1:20:29.480\n instead of about what's real.\n\n1:20:30.360 --> 1:20:31.400\n And there are probably examples\n\n1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:33.840\n from modern physics that fit that.\n\n1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:36.760\n And I think what she teaches in the book\n\n1:20:36.760 --> 1:20:38.680\n is how to ground your concepts\n\n1:20:38.680 --> 1:20:41.520\n and how to bring them into grounding in reality.\n\n1:20:41.520 --> 1:20:43.520\n So Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology,\n\n1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:45.400\n note that it's only an introduction\n\n1:20:45.400 --> 1:20:46.960\n because one of the things she realized,\n\n1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:49.320\n one of the things that I think a lot of her critics\n\n1:20:49.320 --> 1:20:51.080\n don't give enough credit for,\n\n1:20:51.080 --> 1:20:55.040\n is that philosophy is, there's no end, right?\n\n1:20:55.040 --> 1:20:57.360\n It's always growing, there are always new discoveries.\n\n1:20:57.360 --> 1:20:59.480\n There's always, it's like science,\n\n1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:00.520\n there's always new things.\n\n1:21:00.520 --> 1:21:05.520\n And there's a ton of work to do in philosophy,\n\n1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:08.640\n and particularly in epistemology and the theory of knowledge.\n\n1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:10.000\n And she was actually,\n\n1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:11.320\n given your interest in mathematics,\n\n1:21:11.320 --> 1:21:14.600\n she actually saw a lot of parallels\n\n1:21:14.600 --> 1:21:17.320\n between math and concept formation.\n\n1:21:18.520 --> 1:21:22.520\n And she was actually, in the years before she died,\n\n1:21:22.520 --> 1:21:24.960\n she was taking private lessons in mathematics,\n\n1:21:24.960 --> 1:21:27.800\n in algebra and calculus,\n\n1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:30.280\n because she believed that there was real insight\n\n1:21:30.280 --> 1:21:32.560\n in understanding algebra in calculus\n\n1:21:32.560 --> 1:21:37.560\n to philosophy and to epistemology.\n\n1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:41.760\n And she also was very interested in neuroscience\n\n1:21:41.760 --> 1:21:44.760\n because she believed that that had a lot to tell us\n\n1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:48.080\n about epistemology, but also about music,\n\n1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:50.000\n therefore about aesthetics.\n\n1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:54.800\n So, I mean, she recognized the importance\n\n1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:56.200\n of all these different fields\n\n1:21:56.200 --> 1:21:58.000\n and the beauty of philosophy\n\n1:21:58.000 --> 1:21:59.960\n is it should be integrating all of them.\n\n1:21:59.960 --> 1:22:02.400\n And one of the sad things about the world in which we live\n\n1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:04.720\n is again, we view these things as silos.\n\n1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:06.200\n We don't view them as integrating.\n\n1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:10.000\n We don't have teams of people from different arena,\n\n1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:13.120\n you know, different fields, you know, discovering things.\n\n1:22:13.120 --> 1:22:16.840\n We become like ants, specialized.\n\n1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:19.480\n So she was definitely like that.\n\n1:22:19.480 --> 1:22:21.840\n And she was constantly curious,\n\n1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:25.680\n constantly interested in new discoveries and new ideas\n\n1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:30.200\n and how this could expand the scope of her philosophy\n\n1:22:30.200 --> 1:22:31.640\n and the application of her philosophy.\n\n1:22:31.640 --> 1:22:33.520\n There's like a million topics I could talk to you,\n\n1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:35.160\n but since you mentioned math, I'm almost curious.\n\n1:22:35.160 --> 1:22:36.240\n We only got three hours.\n\n1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:37.080\n Oh, okay.\n\n1:22:37.080 --> 1:22:40.720\n I'm almost curious.\n\n1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:41.640\n I don't know if you're familiar\n\n1:22:41.640 --> 1:22:44.160\n with Gayle's incompleteness theorem.\n\n1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:45.080\n I'm not, unfortunately.\n\n1:22:45.080 --> 1:22:45.920\n Okay.\n\n1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:50.920\n It was a powerful proof that any axiomatic systems,\n\n1:22:51.120 --> 1:22:53.840\n when you start from a bunch of axioms,\n\n1:22:53.840 --> 1:22:57.880\n that there will, in that system,\n\n1:22:57.880 --> 1:23:00.920\n provably must be an inconsistency.\n\n1:23:00.920 --> 1:23:04.520\n So that was this painful like stab\n\n1:23:04.520 --> 1:23:07.440\n in the idea of mathematics that, no,\n\n1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:09.960\n if we start with a set of assumptions,\n\n1:23:09.960 --> 1:23:12.960\n kind of like Ayn Rand started with objectivism,\n\n1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:16.540\n there will have to be at least one contradiction.\n\n1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:21.000\n See, I intuitively am gonna say that's false.\n\n1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:25.320\n Philosophically, but in math, it's just true.\n\n1:23:25.320 --> 1:23:26.160\n And that's...\n\n1:23:26.160 --> 1:23:28.240\n It's a question about how you define,\n\n1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:30.200\n again, definitions matter,\n\n1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:32.800\n and you have to be careful on how you define axioms.\n\n1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:34.880\n And you have to be careful about what you define\n\n1:23:34.880 --> 1:23:36.880\n as an inconsistency and what that means\n\n1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:38.520\n to say there's an inconsistency.\n\n1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:39.360\n And I don't know.\n\n1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:40.200\n I'm not gonna say more than that,\n\n1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:41.360\n because I don't know.\n\n1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:46.360\n But I'm suspicious that there is some...\n\n1:23:46.360 --> 1:23:47.600\n And this is the power of philosophy.\n\n1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:49.000\n And this is why I said before,\n\n1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:50.560\n concept formation is so important.\n\n1:23:50.560 --> 1:23:52.960\n And understanding concept formation is so important,\n\n1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:54.200\n for particularly, again, mathematics,\n\n1:23:54.200 --> 1:23:55.840\n because it's such an abstract field.\n\n1:23:55.840 --> 1:24:00.280\n And it's so easy to lose grounding in reality\n\n1:24:00.280 --> 1:24:03.680\n that if you properly define axioms,\n\n1:24:03.680 --> 1:24:05.600\n and you properly define what you're doing in math,\n\n1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:06.520\n whether that is true.\n\n1:24:06.520 --> 1:24:08.240\n And I don't think it is.\n\n1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:09.080\n This is a...\n\n1:24:09.080 --> 1:24:11.160\n Yeah, we'll leave it as an open mystery,\n\n1:24:11.160 --> 1:24:13.460\n because actually, this audience,\n\n1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:19.000\n there's literally over 100,000 people that have PhDs.\n\n1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:21.360\n So they know Gaydo's The Compliance Theorem.\n\n1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:25.040\n I have this intuition that there's something different\n\n1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:27.240\n to mathematics and philosophy\n\n1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:28.880\n that I'd love to hear from people.\n\n1:24:28.880 --> 1:24:31.480\n Like, what exactly is that difference?\n\n1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:36.000\n Because there's a precision to mathematics\n\n1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:39.100\n that philosophy doesn't have,\n\n1:24:39.100 --> 1:24:42.680\n but that precision gets you in trouble.\n\n1:24:42.680 --> 1:24:46.340\n It somehow, it actually takes you away from truth.\n\n1:24:46.340 --> 1:24:49.840\n Like, the very constraints of the language used\n\n1:24:49.840 --> 1:24:53.400\n in mathematics actually puts a constraint\n\n1:24:53.400 --> 1:24:56.160\n on the capture of truth that it's able to do.\n\n1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:00.520\n I'm gonna argue that that is a total product\n\n1:25:00.520 --> 1:25:02.800\n of the way you're conceptualizing\n\n1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:05.720\n the terms within mathematics.\n\n1:25:05.720 --> 1:25:07.640\n It's not in reality.\n\n1:25:07.640 --> 1:25:10.440\n Yeah, so you would argue it's in the fact\n\n1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:13.760\n that mathematics, in as much as it's detached from reality,\n\n1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:15.200\n that you can do these kinds of things.\n\n1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:20.200\n Yes, and that mathematicians have come up with concepts\n\n1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:25.200\n that they haven't grounded in reality properly\n\n1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:28.200\n that allows them to go off in places\n\n1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:29.960\n that don't lead to truth.\n\n1:25:29.960 --> 1:25:31.480\n That's right, that don't lead to truth.\n\n1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:34.280\n But I encourage you then, I encourage you\n\n1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:38.800\n to do one of these podcasts with one of our philosophers\n\n1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:42.200\n who know more about this stuff.\n\n1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:43.680\n And if you move to Austin,\n\n1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:45.640\n I've got somebody I'd recommend to you.\n\n1:25:45.640 --> 1:25:47.960\n And I'd love to hear from you.\n\n1:25:47.960 --> 1:25:50.320\n I've got somebody I'd recommend to you.\n\n1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:51.920\n Can you throw a name out, or no?\n\n1:25:51.920 --> 1:25:54.600\n Yeah, I mean, I would talk to Greg Saumieri.\n\n1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:58.200\n When you say our, can you say what you mean by our?\n\n1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:00.600\n I'd say people who are affiliated\n\n1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:02.720\n with the Ironman Institute are philosophers\n\n1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:05.200\n who are affiliated with objectivism.\n\n1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:08.720\n And Greg is one of our brightest, and he's in Austin.\n\n1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:11.560\n He's just got a position at UT,\n\n1:26:11.560 --> 1:26:13.720\n so at the University of Texas.\n\n1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:16.200\n And he would want, Ankar Gatte would be another one\n\n1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:19.160\n who works at the Institute and a chief philosophy officer\n\n1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:20.000\n at the Institute.\n\n1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:20.840\n That's awesome.\n\n1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:24.520\n And there are others who specialize in philosophy\n\n1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:28.720\n of science who I think Greg could probably give you a lead.\n\n1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:31.320\n But these are unbelievably smart people\n\n1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:34.480\n who know this part of the philosophy much better than I do.\n\n1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:36.640\n What, can you just briefly perhaps say\n\n1:26:36.640 --> 1:26:38.560\n what is the Ironman Institute?\n\n1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:41.400\n Yeah, so the Ironman Institute was an organization founded\n\n1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:44.760\n three years after Ironman died.\n\n1:26:44.760 --> 1:26:47.480\n She died in 1982.\n\n1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:51.160\n And it was founded in 1985 to promote her ideas,\n\n1:26:51.160 --> 1:26:54.160\n to make sure that her ideas and her novels\n\n1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:58.320\n continued in the culture and were relevant.\n\n1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:01.880\n Well, they're relevant, but the people saw the relevance.\n\n1:27:01.880 --> 1:27:04.320\n So our mission is to get people to read her books,\n\n1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:06.320\n to engage in the ideas.\n\n1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:10.080\n We teach, we have the Objectivist Academic Center\n\n1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:12.760\n where we teach the philosophy,\n\n1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:14.800\n primarily to graduate students and others\n\n1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:15.880\n who take their ideas seriously\n\n1:27:15.880 --> 1:27:20.880\n and who really want a deep understanding of the philosophy.\n\n1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:22.680\n And we apply the ideas.\n\n1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:25.080\n So we take the ideas and apply them to ethics,\n\n1:27:25.080 --> 1:27:28.200\n to philosophy, to issues of the day,\n\n1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:31.160\n which is more my strength and more what I tend to do.\n\n1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:34.760\n I've never formally studied philosophy.\n\n1:27:34.760 --> 1:27:39.640\n So all my education philosophy is informal.\n\n1:27:39.640 --> 1:27:43.360\n And I'm an engineer and a finance guy.\n\n1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:44.600\n That's my background.\n\n1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:45.760\n So I'm a numbers guy.\n\n1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:49.720\n Well, let me, I feel pretty undereducated.\n\n1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:54.840\n I have a pretty open mind,\n\n1:27:54.840 --> 1:27:57.120\n which sometimes can be painful on the internet\n\n1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:00.820\n because people mock me or,\n\n1:28:02.760 --> 1:28:05.520\n if I say something nuanced about communism,\n\n1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:09.120\n people immediately kind of put you in a bin\n\n1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:10.760\n or something like that.\n\n1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:12.660\n It hurts to be open minded to say,\n\n1:28:12.660 --> 1:28:15.100\n I don't know, to ask the question,\n\n1:28:15.100 --> 1:28:19.260\n why is communism or Marxism so problematic?\n\n1:28:19.260 --> 1:28:21.920\n Why is capitalism problematic and so on?\n\n1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:25.200\n But let me nevertheless go into that direction with you.\n\n1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:29.820\n Maybe let's talk about capitalism a little bit.\n\n1:28:29.820 --> 1:28:32.800\n How does Objectivism compare,\n\n1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:36.080\n relate to the idea of capitalism?\n\n1:28:36.080 --> 1:28:37.880\n Well, first we have to define what capitalism is.\n\n1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:40.940\n Cause again, people use capitalism in all kinds of ways.\n\n1:28:40.940 --> 1:28:44.000\n And I know you had Ray Dalio on your show once.\n\n1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.320\n I need to listen to that episode.\n\n1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:48.680\n But Ray has no clue what capitalism is.\n\n1:28:48.680 --> 1:28:51.640\n And that's his big problem.\n\n1:28:52.520 --> 1:28:56.860\n So when he says there are real problems today in capitalism,\n\n1:28:56.860 --> 1:28:58.200\n he's not talking about capitalism.\n\n1:28:58.200 --> 1:28:59.880\n He's talking about problems in the world today.\n\n1:28:59.880 --> 1:29:01.440\n And I agree with many of the problems,\n\n1:29:01.440 --> 1:29:03.400\n but they have nothing to do with capitalism.\n\n1:29:03.400 --> 1:29:08.400\n Capitalism is a social, political, economic system\n\n1:29:08.680 --> 1:29:13.360\n in which all property is privately owned\n\n1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:15.280\n and in which the only role of government\n\n1:29:15.280 --> 1:29:18.040\n is the protection of individual rights.\n\n1:29:18.040 --> 1:29:19.920\n I think it's the ideal system.\n\n1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:21.040\n I think it's the right system\n\n1:29:21.040 --> 1:29:22.320\n for the reasons we talked about earlier.\n\n1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:24.440\n It's a system that leaves you as an individual\n\n1:29:24.440 --> 1:29:27.360\n to pursue your values, your life, your happiness,\n\n1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:28.920\n free of coercion and force.\n\n1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:32.120\n And you get to decide what happens to you.\n\n1:29:32.120 --> 1:29:34.400\n And I get to decide if to help you or not, right?\n\n1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:35.580\n Let's say you fall flat on your face.\n\n1:29:35.580 --> 1:29:37.280\n People always say, well, what about the poor?\n\n1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:39.840\n Well, if you care about the poor, help them.\n\n1:29:39.840 --> 1:29:41.040\n Right.\n\n1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:43.760\n Just don't, you know, what do you need a government for?\n\n1:29:43.760 --> 1:29:46.920\n You know, I always ask audiences, okay,\n\n1:29:46.920 --> 1:29:49.760\n if there's a poor kid who can't afford to go to school\n\n1:29:49.760 --> 1:29:50.780\n and all the schools are private\n\n1:29:50.780 --> 1:29:53.400\n because capitalism is being instituted\n\n1:29:54.360 --> 1:29:55.200\n and he can't go to school,\n\n1:29:55.200 --> 1:29:57.160\n would you be willing to participate in a fund\n\n1:29:57.160 --> 1:29:58.920\n that pays for his education?\n\n1:29:58.920 --> 1:30:00.440\n Every hand in the room goes up.\n\n1:30:00.440 --> 1:30:02.460\n So what do you need government for?\n\n1:30:02.460 --> 1:30:05.920\n Just let's get all the money together and pay for schooling.\n\n1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:08.340\n So the point is that what capitalism does\n\n1:30:08.340 --> 1:30:11.160\n is leave individuals free to make their own decisions.\n\n1:30:11.160 --> 1:30:14.120\n And as long as they're not violating other people's rights,\n\n1:30:14.120 --> 1:30:17.320\n in other words, as long as they're not using coercion force\n\n1:30:17.320 --> 1:30:20.240\n on other people, then leave them alone.\n\n1:30:20.240 --> 1:30:21.880\n And people are going to make mistakes\n\n1:30:21.880 --> 1:30:23.100\n and people are gonna screw up their lives\n\n1:30:23.100 --> 1:30:24.440\n and people are gonna commit suicide.\n\n1:30:24.440 --> 1:30:27.320\n People are gonna do terrible things to themselves.\n\n1:30:27.320 --> 1:30:29.080\n That is fundamentally their problem.\n\n1:30:29.080 --> 1:30:30.880\n And if you want to help,\n\n1:30:30.880 --> 1:30:33.780\n you under capitalism are free to help.\n\n1:30:33.780 --> 1:30:35.960\n It's just the only thing that doesn't happen\n\n1:30:35.960 --> 1:30:38.920\n under capitalism is you don't get to impose your will\n\n1:30:38.920 --> 1:30:40.480\n on other people.\n\n1:30:40.480 --> 1:30:41.760\n Now, how's that a bad thing?\n\n1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:46.760\n So the question then is how does the implementation\n\n1:30:47.320 --> 1:30:52.320\n of capitalism deviate from its ideal in practice?\n\n1:30:54.840 --> 1:30:57.440\n I mean, this is what is the question with a lot of systems\n\n1:30:57.440 --> 1:31:00.820\n is how does it start to then fail?\n\n1:31:00.820 --> 1:31:05.020\n So one thing maybe you can correct me or inform me,\n\n1:31:06.200 --> 1:31:10.480\n it seems like information is very important.\n\n1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:15.480\n Like being able to make decisions, to be free,\n\n1:31:15.960 --> 1:31:19.120\n you have to have access, full access\n\n1:31:19.120 --> 1:31:23.600\n of all the information you need to make rational decisions.\n\n1:31:23.600 --> 1:31:25.720\n No, that can't be.\n\n1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:28.720\n Because it can be right, because none of us has full access\n\n1:31:28.720 --> 1:31:31.200\n to all the information we need.\n\n1:31:31.200 --> 1:31:32.320\n I mean, what does that even mean?\n\n1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:35.640\n And how big, how much of the scope do you wanna do?\n\n1:31:35.640 --> 1:31:36.480\n Let's just start there.\n\n1:31:36.480 --> 1:31:37.320\n Yeah, we don't.\n\n1:31:37.320 --> 1:31:39.780\n So you need to have access to information.\n\n1:31:39.780 --> 1:31:41.880\n So one of the big criticisms of capitalism\n\n1:31:41.880 --> 1:31:44.220\n is this asymmetrical information.\n\n1:31:44.220 --> 1:31:46.760\n The drug maker has more information about the drug\n\n1:31:46.760 --> 1:31:49.600\n than the drug buyer, pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n1:31:50.780 --> 1:31:53.720\n True, it's a problem.\n\n1:31:53.720 --> 1:31:55.720\n Well, I wonder if one can think about,\n\n1:31:55.720 --> 1:31:58.040\n an entrepreneur can think about how to solve that problem.\n\n1:31:58.040 --> 1:32:01.160\n See, I view any one of these challenges to capitalism\n\n1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:03.560\n as an opportunity for entrepreneur to make money.\n\n1:32:03.560 --> 1:32:04.840\n And they have the freedom to do it.\n\n1:32:04.840 --> 1:32:07.340\n Yeah, so imagine an entrepreneur steps in and says,\n\n1:32:07.340 --> 1:32:11.440\n I will test all the drugs that drug companies make,\n\n1:32:11.440 --> 1:32:15.880\n and I will provide you for a fee with the answer.\n\n1:32:15.880 --> 1:32:18.460\n And how do I know he's not gonna be corrupted?\n\n1:32:18.460 --> 1:32:21.680\n Well, there'll be other ones and they'll compete.\n\n1:32:21.680 --> 1:32:25.080\n And who am I to tell which one of these is the right one?\n\n1:32:25.080 --> 1:32:26.760\n Well, it won't be you really getting\n\n1:32:26.760 --> 1:32:28.800\n the information from them.\n\n1:32:28.800 --> 1:32:30.520\n It'll be your doctor.\n\n1:32:30.520 --> 1:32:32.220\n The doctors need that information.\n\n1:32:33.140 --> 1:32:35.960\n So the doctor who has some expertise in medicine\n\n1:32:35.960 --> 1:32:39.240\n will be evaluating which rating agency to use\n\n1:32:39.240 --> 1:32:41.460\n to evaluate the drugs and which ones then\n\n1:32:41.460 --> 1:32:43.040\n to recommend to you.\n\n1:32:43.040 --> 1:32:45.440\n So do we need an FDA?\n\n1:32:45.440 --> 1:32:48.320\n Do we need a government that siphons all the information\n\n1:32:48.320 --> 1:32:51.040\n to one source that does all the research, all the thing,\n\n1:32:51.040 --> 1:32:52.960\n and has a clear incentive, by the way,\n\n1:32:52.960 --> 1:32:55.020\n not to approve drugs.\n\n1:32:55.020 --> 1:32:57.480\n Because they don't make any money from it.\n\n1:32:57.480 --> 1:32:59.200\n Nobody pays them for the information.\n\n1:32:59.200 --> 1:33:00.680\n Nobody pays them to be accurate.\n\n1:33:00.680 --> 1:33:02.400\n They're bureaucrats at the end of the day.\n\n1:33:02.400 --> 1:33:04.080\n And what is a bureaucrat?\n\n1:33:04.080 --> 1:33:06.640\n What's the main focus of a bureaucrat?\n\n1:33:06.640 --> 1:33:08.960\n Even if they go in with the best of intentions,\n\n1:33:08.960 --> 1:33:10.800\n which I'm sure all the scientists at the FDA\n\n1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:13.320\n have the best of intentions, what's their incentive?\n\n1:33:13.320 --> 1:33:17.020\n The system builds in this incentive not to screw up.\n\n1:33:17.020 --> 1:33:21.960\n Because one drug gets value and does damage,\n\n1:33:21.960 --> 1:33:23.760\n you lose your job.\n\n1:33:23.760 --> 1:33:26.800\n But if a hundred drugs that could cure cancer tomorrow\n\n1:33:26.800 --> 1:33:29.060\n don't ever get to market,\n\n1:33:29.060 --> 1:33:31.520\n nobody's gonna come after you.\n\n1:33:31.520 --> 1:33:32.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:32.360 --> 1:33:35.760\n And you're saying that's not a mechanism,\n\n1:33:35.760 --> 1:33:38.200\n and that's conducive to like...\n\n1:33:38.200 --> 1:33:39.400\n You see, the marketplace is competition.\n\n1:33:39.400 --> 1:33:41.160\n So if you won't approve the drug,\n\n1:33:41.160 --> 1:33:43.720\n if I still think it's possible, I will.\n\n1:33:43.720 --> 1:33:45.200\n And it's not zero one.\n\n1:33:45.200 --> 1:33:47.160\n You see the other thing that happens with the FDA\n\n1:33:47.160 --> 1:33:48.000\n is it's zero one.\n\n1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.320\n It's either approved or it's not approved.\n\n1:33:50.320 --> 1:33:52.540\n Oh, it's approved for this, but it's not approved for that.\n\n1:33:52.540 --> 1:33:56.960\n But what if a drug came out and you said, right?\n\n1:33:56.960 --> 1:33:58.060\n You told the doctors,\n\n1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:04.160\n this drug in 10% of the cases can cause patients\n\n1:34:05.080 --> 1:34:07.480\n an increased risk of heart disease.\n\n1:34:07.480 --> 1:34:09.640\n You and your patients should,\n\n1:34:09.640 --> 1:34:12.600\n we're not forcing you, but you should, right?\n\n1:34:12.600 --> 1:34:15.440\n It's your medical responsibility to evaluate that\n\n1:34:15.440 --> 1:34:17.420\n and decide if the drug is appropriate or not.\n\n1:34:17.420 --> 1:34:19.040\n Why don't I get to make that choice\n\n1:34:19.040 --> 1:34:21.720\n if I wanna take on the 10% risk of heart disease?\n\n1:34:21.720 --> 1:34:24.480\n So there was a drug, and right now I forget the name,\n\n1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:26.320\n but it was a drug against pain,\n\n1:34:26.320 --> 1:34:29.280\n particularly for arthritic pain, and it worked.\n\n1:34:29.280 --> 1:34:31.560\n It reduced pain dramatically, right?\n\n1:34:31.560 --> 1:34:33.220\n And some people tried everything,\n\n1:34:33.220 --> 1:34:35.760\n and this was the only drug that reduced their pain.\n\n1:34:35.760 --> 1:34:39.320\n And it turned out that in 10% of the cases,\n\n1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:42.160\n it caused the elevated risk.\n\n1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:43.880\n It didn't kill people necessarily,\n\n1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:46.040\n but it caused elevated risk of heart disease.\n\n1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:49.040\n Okay, what did the FDA do?\n\n1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:50.000\n It banned the drug.\n\n1:34:50.880 --> 1:34:53.560\n Some people, I know a lot of people who said\n\n1:34:53.560 --> 1:34:58.400\n living with pain is much worse than taking on a 10% risk.\n\n1:34:58.400 --> 1:34:59.520\n Again, probabilities, right?\n\n1:34:59.520 --> 1:35:01.320\n People don't think in those numbers.\n\n1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:03.160\n 10% risk of maybe getting heart disease.\n\n1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:04.620\n Why don't I get to make that choice?\n\n1:35:04.620 --> 1:35:07.480\n Why does some bureaucrat make that choice for me?\n\n1:35:07.480 --> 1:35:08.840\n That's capitalism.\n\n1:35:08.840 --> 1:35:11.100\n Capitalism gives you the choice,\n\n1:35:11.100 --> 1:35:13.080\n not you as an ignorant person.\n\n1:35:13.080 --> 1:35:17.040\n You with your doctor and a whole marketplace,\n\n1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:20.100\n which is not created to provide you with information.\n\n1:35:20.100 --> 1:35:23.680\n And think about a world where we didn't have\n\n1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:25.780\n all these regulations and controls.\n\n1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:31.960\n The amount of opportunities that would exist\n\n1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:35.000\n to create, to provide information,\n\n1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:36.920\n to educate you about that information,\n\n1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:39.520\n would mushroom dramatically.\n\n1:35:39.520 --> 1:35:40.980\n Bloomberg, you know, the billionaire,\n\n1:35:40.980 --> 1:35:42.960\n Bloomberg, you know, how did he make his money?\n\n1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:45.560\n He made his money by providing financial information,\n\n1:35:45.560 --> 1:35:47.480\n by creating this service called Bloomberg\n\n1:35:47.480 --> 1:35:49.560\n that you buy a terminal and you get\n\n1:35:49.560 --> 1:35:50.840\n all this amazing information.\n\n1:35:50.840 --> 1:35:53.720\n And he was before computers, desktop computers.\n\n1:35:53.720 --> 1:35:55.240\n I mean, he was very early on\n\n1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:57.360\n in that whole computing revolution,\n\n1:35:57.360 --> 1:35:59.800\n but his focus was providing financial information\n\n1:35:59.800 --> 1:36:00.720\n to professionals.\n\n1:36:02.040 --> 1:36:04.380\n And you hire a professional to manage your money.\n\n1:36:04.380 --> 1:36:05.880\n That's the way it's supposed to be.\n\n1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:08.400\n You know, you have to have,\n\n1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:11.160\n so you as an individual cannot have\n\n1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:12.800\n all the knowledge you need in medicine,\n\n1:36:12.800 --> 1:36:14.080\n all the knowledge you need in finance,\n\n1:36:14.080 --> 1:36:16.240\n all the knowledge you need in every aspect of your life.\n\n1:36:16.240 --> 1:36:17.240\n You can't do that.\n\n1:36:17.240 --> 1:36:21.120\n You have to delegate and you hire a doctor.\n\n1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:23.040\n Now you should be able to figure out\n\n1:36:23.040 --> 1:36:24.180\n if the doctor's good or not.\n\n1:36:24.180 --> 1:36:26.800\n You should be able to ask doctors for reasons\n\n1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:28.920\n for why you have to make the decision at the end.\n\n1:36:28.920 --> 1:36:29.760\n But that's why you have a doctor.\n\n1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:31.040\n That's why you have a financial advisor.\n\n1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:32.800\n That's why you have different people\n\n1:36:32.800 --> 1:36:36.400\n who you're delegating certain aspects of your life to,\n\n1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:38.400\n but you want choices.\n\n1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:41.520\n And what the marketplace provides is those choices.\n\n1:36:41.520 --> 1:36:44.120\n So let me then,\n\n1:36:44.120 --> 1:36:45.520\n this is what I do.\n\n1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:47.640\n I'll make a dumb case for things\n\n1:36:47.640 --> 1:36:48.920\n and then you shut me down\n\n1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:51.120\n and then the internet says how dumb Lex is.\n\n1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:51.940\n This is good.\n\n1:36:51.940 --> 1:36:52.780\n This is how it works.\n\n1:36:52.780 --> 1:36:57.400\n I'm good at shutting down and they're foolish\n\n1:36:57.400 --> 1:36:59.820\n in blaming you for the question\n\n1:36:59.820 --> 1:37:02.840\n because you're here to ask me questions.\n\n1:37:02.840 --> 1:37:06.640\n Let me make a case for socialism.\n\n1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:08.680\n So.\n\n1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:11.640\n It's gonna be bad because that's the only case\n\n1:37:11.640 --> 1:37:12.720\n there is for socialism.\n\n1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:13.640\n That's reality.\n\n1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:16.880\n So perhaps it's not a case for socialism,\n\n1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:21.800\n but just a certain notion that inequality,\n\n1:37:22.760 --> 1:37:24.320\n the wealth inequality,\n\n1:37:24.320 --> 1:37:28.120\n that the bigger the gap between the poorest\n\n1:37:28.120 --> 1:37:30.400\n or the average and the richest,\n\n1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:34.960\n the more painful it is to be average.\n\n1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:36.960\n Psychologically speaking,\n\n1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:41.520\n if you know that there is the CEOs of companies\n\n1:37:41.520 --> 1:37:45.940\n make 300, 1000, 1 million times more than you do,\n\n1:37:45.940 --> 1:37:50.480\n that makes life for a large part of the population\n\n1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:51.560\n less fulfilling.\n\n1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:55.200\n That there's a relative notion to the experience of our life\n\n1:37:55.200 --> 1:37:58.160\n that even though everybody's life has gotten better\n\n1:37:58.160 --> 1:38:02.000\n over the past decades and centuries,\n\n1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:05.240\n it may feel actually worse\n\n1:38:05.240 --> 1:38:08.160\n because you know that life could be so,\n\n1:38:08.160 --> 1:38:11.920\n so much better in the life of the CEOs\n\n1:38:11.920 --> 1:38:16.920\n that yeah, that gap is fundamentally a thing\n\n1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:19.700\n that is undesirable in a society.\n\n1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:22.700\n Everything about that is wrong.\n\n1:38:22.700 --> 1:38:25.040\n Okay.\n\n1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:27.040\n I like to start off like that.\n\n1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:30.480\n Which, so I mean,\n\n1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:32.200\n so my wife likes to remind me\n\n1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:36.080\n that as well as we've done in life,\n\n1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:38.200\n we are actually from a wealth perspective\n\n1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:41.080\n closer to a homeless person than we are to Bill Gates.\n\n1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:42.080\n Just a math, right?\n\n1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:43.080\n Just a math, right?\n\n1:38:44.840 --> 1:38:46.120\n It's a good ego check.\n\n1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:47.800\n When I look at Bill Gates,\n\n1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:49.240\n I get a smile on my face.\n\n1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:50.080\n I love Bill Gates.\n\n1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:51.360\n I've never met Bill Gates.\n\n1:38:51.360 --> 1:38:52.400\n I love Bill Gates.\n\n1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:54.760\n I love what he stands for.\n\n1:38:54.760 --> 1:38:57.560\n I love that he has $100 billion.\n\n1:38:57.560 --> 1:39:01.120\n I love that he has built a trampoline room in his house\n\n1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:03.520\n where his kids can jump up and down in a trampoline\n\n1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:04.880\n in a safe environment.\n\n1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:06.600\n Can we take another billionaire?\n\n1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:09.380\n Because I'm not sure if you're paying attention,\n\n1:39:09.380 --> 1:39:12.340\n but there's all kinds of conspiracy theories\n\n1:39:12.340 --> 1:39:13.800\n about Bill Gates.\n\n1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:15.540\n Well, but that's part of the story, right?\n\n1:39:15.540 --> 1:39:16.740\n They have to pull him down\n\n1:39:16.740 --> 1:39:19.080\n because people resent him for other reasons.\n\n1:39:19.080 --> 1:39:19.920\n That's strange.\n\n1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:21.500\n But yes, we can take Jeff Bezos.\n\n1:39:21.500 --> 1:39:24.880\n We can say my favorite, historically,\n\n1:39:24.880 --> 1:39:28.740\n just because I like a lot about him, was Steve Jobs.\n\n1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:32.720\n I mean, I love these people.\n\n1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:36.340\n And I can't, there are very few billionaires I don't love.\n\n1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:40.160\n In the sense that I appreciate everything they've done\n\n1:39:40.160 --> 1:39:45.160\n for me, for people I cherish and love,\n\n1:39:46.020 --> 1:39:48.360\n they've made the world a better place.\n\n1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:49.800\n Why?\n\n1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:54.800\n Would it ever cross my mind that they make me look bad\n\n1:39:54.900 --> 1:39:55.920\n because they're richer than me\n\n1:39:55.920 --> 1:39:58.360\n or that I don't have what they have?\n\n1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:02.520\n They've made me so much richer\n\n1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:08.040\n that they've made inventions that used to cost millions\n\n1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:12.120\n and millions and millions of dollars accessible to me.\n\n1:40:12.120 --> 1:40:15.960\n I mean, this is a supercomputer in my pocket.\n\n1:40:16.920 --> 1:40:18.540\n Now, but think about it, right?\n\n1:40:18.540 --> 1:40:20.080\n What is the difference between,\n\n1:40:20.080 --> 1:40:22.560\n and I'll get to the essence of your point in a minute,\n\n1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:24.680\n but think about what the difference is\n\n1:40:24.680 --> 1:40:27.600\n between me and Bill Gates in terms of,\n\n1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:29.360\n because it's true that in terms of wealth,\n\n1:40:29.360 --> 1:40:30.840\n I'm closer to the homeless person,\n\n1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:32.920\n but in terms of my day to day life,\n\n1:40:32.920 --> 1:40:34.880\n I'm closer to Bill Gates.\n\n1:40:34.880 --> 1:40:36.880\n You know, we both live in a nice house.\n\n1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:39.240\n His is nicer, but we live in a nice house.\n\n1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:42.160\n His is bigger, but mine is plenty big.\n\n1:40:42.160 --> 1:40:43.640\n We both drive cars.\n\n1:40:43.640 --> 1:40:45.840\n His is nicer, but we both drive cars.\n\n1:40:45.840 --> 1:40:50.160\n We both drive cars, cars, 100 years ago, what cars?\n\n1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:54.280\n We both can fly, get on a plane in Los Angeles\n\n1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:57.060\n and fly to New York and get there in about the same time.\n\n1:40:57.060 --> 1:40:58.480\n We're both flying private.\n\n1:40:59.400 --> 1:41:01.240\n The only difference is my private plane\n\n1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:04.720\n I share with 300 other people and his,\n\n1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:07.120\n but it's accessible.\n\n1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:08.680\n It's relatively comfortable.\n\n1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:11.360\n Again, in the perspective of 50 years ago, 100 years ago,\n\n1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:14.040\n it's unimaginable that I could fly like that\n\n1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:15.480\n for such a low fee.\n\n1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:18.840\n We live very similar lives in that sense.\n\n1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:20.160\n So I don't resent him.\n\n1:41:20.160 --> 1:41:23.800\n So first of all, I'm an exception to the supposed rule\n\n1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:24.840\n that people resent.\n\n1:41:24.840 --> 1:41:26.800\n I don't think anybody, I don't think people do resent\n\n1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:28.320\n unless they're taught to resent.\n\n1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:29.680\n And this is the key.\n\n1:41:29.680 --> 1:41:33.120\n People are taught and I've seen this in America.\n\n1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:37.520\n And this is to me the most horrible shocking thing\n\n1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:40.400\n that has happened in America over the last 40 years.\n\n1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:42.320\n I came to America, so I'm an immigrant.\n\n1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:45.720\n I came to America from Israel in 1987.\n\n1:41:45.720 --> 1:41:48.400\n And I came here because I thought this was the place\n\n1:41:48.400 --> 1:41:50.840\n where I could, where I'd had the most opportunities\n\n1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:52.880\n and it is, most opportunities.\n\n1:41:52.880 --> 1:41:54.280\n And I came here because I believed\n\n1:41:54.280 --> 1:41:58.820\n there was a certain American spirit of individualism\n\n1:41:58.820 --> 1:42:01.120\n and exactly the opposite of what you just described.\n\n1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:06.120\n A sense of I live my life, it's my happiness.\n\n1:42:06.320 --> 1:42:07.640\n I'm not looking at my neighbor.\n\n1:42:07.640 --> 1:42:09.560\n I'm not competing with the Joneses.\n\n1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:11.680\n The American dream is my dream.\n\n1:42:11.680 --> 1:42:14.540\n My two kids, my dog, my station wagon.\n\n1:42:14.540 --> 1:42:17.480\n Not because other people have it, it's because I want it.\n\n1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:20.820\n In that sense, and when I came here in the 80s,\n\n1:42:21.740 --> 1:42:22.800\n you had that.\n\n1:42:22.800 --> 1:42:25.220\n You had, you still had it.\n\n1:42:25.220 --> 1:42:28.080\n It was less than I think it had been in the past.\n\n1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:29.440\n But you had that spirit.\n\n1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:30.320\n There was no envy.\n\n1:42:30.320 --> 1:42:31.240\n There was no resentment.\n\n1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:34.160\n There were rich people and they were celebrated.\n\n1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:37.520\n There was still this admiration for entrepreneurs\n\n1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:39.660\n and admiration for success.\n\n1:42:39.660 --> 1:42:42.660\n Not by everybody, certainly not by the intellectuals,\n\n1:42:42.660 --> 1:42:45.080\n but by the average person.\n\n1:42:45.080 --> 1:42:47.920\n I have witnessed particularly over the last 10 years\n\n1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:50.100\n a complete transformation\n\n1:42:50.100 --> 1:42:52.460\n and America's become like Europe.\n\n1:42:52.460 --> 1:42:54.220\n I know, are you Russian?\n\n1:42:54.220 --> 1:42:55.060\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n1:42:55.060 --> 1:42:59.440\n It's become Russian in a sense where,\n\n1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:02.260\n you know, they've always done these studies.\n\n1:43:02.260 --> 1:43:05.380\n You know, I'll give you a hundred dollars\n\n1:43:05.380 --> 1:43:06.820\n and your neighbor a hundred dollars\n\n1:43:06.820 --> 1:43:11.480\n or I'll give you, what was it, I'll give you a thousand\n\n1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:14.000\n dollars but your neighbor gets $10,000\n\n1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:16.540\n and a Russian will always choose the hundred dollars, right?\n\n1:43:16.540 --> 1:43:20.700\n He wants equality above being better himself.\n\n1:43:20.700 --> 1:43:24.500\n Americans would always choose that gap.\n\n1:43:24.500 --> 1:43:25.340\n And that's changing.\n\n1:43:25.340 --> 1:43:26.760\n My sense is not anymore.\n\n1:43:26.760 --> 1:43:31.760\n And it's changing because we've been told it should change.\n\n1:43:32.140 --> 1:43:34.960\n And morally you're saying that doesn't make any sense.\n\n1:43:34.960 --> 1:43:38.860\n So there's no sense in which, let me put another spin.\n\n1:43:38.860 --> 1:43:41.740\n I forget the book, but the sense of,\n\n1:43:41.740 --> 1:43:45.460\n if you're working for Steve Jobs and your hands,\n\n1:43:45.460 --> 1:43:48.220\n you're the engineer behind the iPhone\n\n1:43:48.220 --> 1:43:51.300\n and there's a sense in which his salary\n\n1:43:51.300 --> 1:43:53.940\n is stealing from your efforts.\n\n1:43:53.940 --> 1:43:57.300\n Because I forget the book, right?\n\n1:43:57.300 --> 1:43:59.920\n That's literally the terminology is used, right?\n\n1:43:59.920 --> 1:44:02.380\n This is straight out of Karl Marx.\n\n1:44:02.380 --> 1:44:05.220\n Sure, it's also straight out of Karl Marx.\n\n1:44:05.220 --> 1:44:08.140\n But there's no sense morally speaking\n\n1:44:08.140 --> 1:44:09.660\n that you see that as the theft.\n\n1:44:09.660 --> 1:44:11.020\n The other way around.\n\n1:44:11.020 --> 1:44:12.620\n That engineer is stealing off of,\n\n1:44:12.620 --> 1:44:14.220\n and it's not stealing, right?\n\n1:44:14.220 --> 1:44:15.700\n It's not.\n\n1:44:15.700 --> 1:44:18.380\n But the engineer is getting more from Steve Jobs\n\n1:44:18.380 --> 1:44:20.420\n by a lot, not by a little bit,\n\n1:44:20.420 --> 1:44:23.300\n than Steve Jobs is getting from the engineer.\n\n1:44:23.300 --> 1:44:26.100\n The engineer, even if they're a great engineer,\n\n1:44:26.100 --> 1:44:27.360\n there are probably other great engineers\n\n1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:28.460\n that could replace him.\n\n1:44:29.420 --> 1:44:32.120\n Would he even have a job without Steve Jobs?\n\n1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:34.940\n Would the industry exist without Steve Jobs?\n\n1:44:34.940 --> 1:44:38.500\n Without the giants that carry these things forward?\n\n1:44:38.500 --> 1:44:39.340\n Let me ask you this.\n\n1:44:39.340 --> 1:44:41.100\n I mean, you're a scientist.\n\n1:44:41.100 --> 1:44:43.500\n Do you resent Einstein for being smarter than you?\n\n1:44:45.840 --> 1:44:48.260\n I mean, and VM, are you angry with him?\n\n1:44:48.260 --> 1:44:51.440\n Would you feel negative towards him\n\n1:44:51.440 --> 1:44:52.620\n if he was in the room right now?\n\n1:44:52.620 --> 1:44:53.980\n Or would you, if he came into the room,\n\n1:44:53.980 --> 1:44:55.300\n you'd say, oh my God.\n\n1:44:55.300 --> 1:44:58.220\n I mean, you interview people who I think some of them\n\n1:44:58.220 --> 1:45:00.460\n are probably smarter than you and me.\n\n1:45:00.460 --> 1:45:03.180\n And your attitude towards them is one of reverence.\n\n1:45:03.180 --> 1:45:06.960\n Well, one interesting little side question there\n\n1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:10.800\n is what is the natural state of being for us humans?\n\n1:45:10.800 --> 1:45:15.620\n You kind of implied education has polluted our minds,\n\n1:45:15.620 --> 1:45:19.580\n but like if I, because you're referring to jealousy,\n\n1:45:19.580 --> 1:45:22.580\n the Einstein question, the Steve Jobs question,\n\n1:45:22.580 --> 1:45:25.980\n I wonder which way, if we're left without education,\n\n1:45:25.980 --> 1:45:27.460\n we would naturally go.\n\n1:45:27.460 --> 1:45:30.060\n So there is no such thing as the natural state\n\n1:45:30.060 --> 1:45:31.900\n in that sense, right?\n\n1:45:31.900 --> 1:45:36.900\n This is the myth of who so is a noble savage\n\n1:45:37.860 --> 1:45:42.460\n and of John Walls is behind the veil of ignorance.\n\n1:45:42.460 --> 1:45:44.740\n Well, if you're ignorant, you're ignorant.\n\n1:45:45.740 --> 1:45:47.180\n You can't make any decisions.\n\n1:45:47.180 --> 1:45:48.220\n You're just ignorant.\n\n1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:54.500\n There is no human nature that determines\n\n1:45:54.500 --> 1:45:56.500\n how you will relate to other people.\n\n1:45:56.500 --> 1:45:58.940\n You will relate to other people based on the conclusions\n\n1:45:58.940 --> 1:46:01.900\n you come to about how to relate to other people.\n\n1:46:01.900 --> 1:46:05.620\n You can relate to other people as values\n\n1:46:06.860 --> 1:46:10.260\n to use your terminology from the perspective of love.\n\n1:46:10.260 --> 1:46:13.560\n This other human being is a value to me\n\n1:46:13.560 --> 1:46:16.380\n and I want to trade with them and trade,\n\n1:46:16.380 --> 1:46:19.020\n the beauty of trade is it's win, win.\n\n1:46:19.020 --> 1:46:21.420\n I want to benefit and they are going to benefit.\n\n1:46:21.420 --> 1:46:22.580\n I don't want to screw them.\n\n1:46:22.580 --> 1:46:24.060\n I don't want them to screw me.\n\n1:46:24.060 --> 1:46:25.540\n I want us to be win, win.\n\n1:46:25.540 --> 1:46:30.540\n Or you can deal with other people as threats, as enemies.\n\n1:46:31.500 --> 1:46:33.540\n Much of human history, we have done that.\n\n1:46:34.540 --> 1:46:37.300\n And therefore, as a zero sum world,\n\n1:46:37.300 --> 1:46:41.860\n what they have, I want, I will take it.\n\n1:46:41.860 --> 1:46:43.060\n I will use force to take it.\n\n1:46:43.060 --> 1:46:44.580\n I will use political force to take it.\n\n1:46:44.580 --> 1:46:46.180\n I will use the force of my arm to take it.\n\n1:46:46.180 --> 1:46:47.620\n I will just take it.\n\n1:46:47.620 --> 1:46:51.020\n So those are two options, right?\n\n1:46:51.020 --> 1:46:52.640\n And they will determine whether we live\n\n1:46:52.640 --> 1:46:54.580\n in civilization or not.\n\n1:46:54.580 --> 1:46:57.420\n And they are determined by conclusions people come to\n\n1:46:57.420 --> 1:46:59.260\n about the world and the nature of reality\n\n1:46:59.260 --> 1:47:01.420\n and the nature of morality and the nature of politics\n\n1:47:01.420 --> 1:47:02.780\n and all these things.\n\n1:47:02.780 --> 1:47:05.060\n They're determined by philosophy.\n\n1:47:05.060 --> 1:47:07.620\n And this is why philosophy is so important\n\n1:47:07.620 --> 1:47:10.700\n because the philosophy shapes,\n\n1:47:10.700 --> 1:47:12.340\n evolution doesn't do this.\n\n1:47:12.340 --> 1:47:14.420\n It doesn't just happen.\n\n1:47:14.420 --> 1:47:17.120\n Ideas shape how we relate to other people.\n\n1:47:18.100 --> 1:47:19.880\n And you say, well, little children do it.\n\n1:47:19.880 --> 1:47:22.540\n Well, little children don't have a frontal cortex.\n\n1:47:22.540 --> 1:47:24.380\n It's not relevant, right?\n\n1:47:24.380 --> 1:47:26.980\n What happens as you develop a frontal cortex,\n\n1:47:26.980 --> 1:47:31.980\n as you develop the brain, you learn ideas.\n\n1:47:32.140 --> 1:47:35.180\n And those ideas will shape how you relate to other people.\n\n1:47:35.180 --> 1:47:36.980\n And if you learn good ideas,\n\n1:47:36.980 --> 1:47:40.400\n you relate to other people in a healthy, productive win, win.\n\n1:47:41.380 --> 1:47:43.820\n And if you develop bad ideas,\n\n1:47:43.820 --> 1:47:47.740\n you will resent other people and you will want their stuff.\n\n1:47:47.740 --> 1:47:50.220\n And the thing is that human progress depends\n\n1:47:50.220 --> 1:47:52.440\n on the win, win relationship.\n\n1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:55.440\n It depends on civilization, depends on peace.\n\n1:47:55.440 --> 1:47:57.780\n It depends on allowing people,\n\n1:47:57.780 --> 1:47:59.220\n going back to what we talked about earlier,\n\n1:47:59.220 --> 1:48:02.620\n allowing people the freedom to think for themselves.\n\n1:48:02.620 --> 1:48:05.020\n And anytime you try to interrupt that,\n\n1:48:05.020 --> 1:48:06.140\n you're causing damage.\n\n1:48:06.140 --> 1:48:09.420\n So this change in America is not some reversion\n\n1:48:09.420 --> 1:48:11.340\n to a natural state.\n\n1:48:11.340 --> 1:48:12.780\n It's a shift in ideas.\n\n1:48:15.620 --> 1:48:19.480\n We still live, the better part of American society\n\n1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:23.420\n and the world, still lives on the remnants\n\n1:48:23.420 --> 1:48:27.420\n of the Enlightenment, the Enlightenment ideas,\n\n1:48:27.420 --> 1:48:30.720\n the ideas that brought about this scientific revolution,\n\n1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:33.060\n the ideas that brought about the creation of this country.\n\n1:48:33.060 --> 1:48:36.420\n And it's the same basic ideas that led to both of those.\n\n1:48:36.420 --> 1:48:41.060\n And as those ideas get more distant,\n\n1:48:41.060 --> 1:48:43.420\n as those ideas are not defended,\n\n1:48:43.420 --> 1:48:47.320\n as those ideas disappear, as Enlightenment goes away,\n\n1:48:47.320 --> 1:48:52.000\n we will become more violent, more resentful,\n\n1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:56.640\n more tribal, more obnoxious, more unpleasant,\n\n1:48:56.640 --> 1:48:58.180\n more primitive.\n\n1:48:58.180 --> 1:49:02.640\n A very specific example of this that bothers me,\n\n1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:04.940\n I'd be curious to get your comment on.\n\n1:49:04.940 --> 1:49:08.740\n So Elon Musk is a billionaire.\n\n1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:14.720\n And one of the things that really,\n\n1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:16.240\n maybe it's almost a pet peeve,\n\n1:49:16.240 --> 1:49:18.480\n it really bothers me when the press\n\n1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:21.360\n and the general public will say,\n\n1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:24.900\n well, all those rockets they're sending up there,\n\n1:49:24.900 --> 1:49:26.480\n those are just like the toys,\n\n1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:28.440\n the games that billionaires play.\n\n1:49:29.940 --> 1:49:34.940\n That to me, billionaire has become a dirty word to use,\n\n1:49:36.480 --> 1:49:41.480\n like as if money can buy or has anything to do with genius.\n\n1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:46.480\n I'm trying to articulate a specific line of question here\n\n1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:53.940\n because it just bothers me.\n\n1:49:53.940 --> 1:49:57.200\n I guess the question is how do we get here\n\n1:49:57.200 --> 1:49:58.480\n and how do we get out of that?\n\n1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:02.240\n Because Elon Musk is doing some of the most incredible things\n\n1:50:02.240 --> 1:50:05.360\n that a human being has ever participated in.\n\n1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:07.480\n Mostly, he doesn't build the rockets himself,\n\n1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:10.480\n he's getting a bunch of other geniuses together that have.\n\n1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:11.440\n That takes genius.\n\n1:50:11.440 --> 1:50:12.320\n That takes genius.\n\n1:50:12.320 --> 1:50:16.480\n But where do we go and how do we get back\n\n1:50:16.480 --> 1:50:19.000\n to where Elon Musk is an inspiring figure\n\n1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:23.200\n as opposed to a billionaire playing with some toys?\n\n1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:25.120\n So this is the role of philosophy.\n\n1:50:25.120 --> 1:50:26.560\n It goes back to the same place.\n\n1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:28.540\n It goes back to our understanding of the world\n\n1:50:28.540 --> 1:50:30.280\n and our role in it.\n\n1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:32.680\n And if you understand that the only way\n\n1:50:32.680 --> 1:50:34.840\n to become a billionaire, for example,\n\n1:50:34.840 --> 1:50:36.200\n is to create value.\n\n1:50:36.200 --> 1:50:37.600\n Value for whom?\n\n1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:39.800\n Value for people who are gonna consume it.\n\n1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:41.240\n The only way to become a billionaire,\n\n1:50:41.240 --> 1:50:45.600\n the only way Elon Musk became a billionaire is through PayPal.\n\n1:50:45.600 --> 1:50:47.560\n Now, PayPal is something we all use.\n\n1:50:47.560 --> 1:50:50.040\n PayPal is an enormous value to all of us.\n\n1:50:50.040 --> 1:50:52.680\n It's why it's worth several billions of dollars\n\n1:50:52.680 --> 1:50:57.680\n which Elon Musk could then earn.\n\n1:50:57.680 --> 1:51:01.640\n But you cannot become a billionaire in a free society\n\n1:51:01.640 --> 1:51:02.920\n by exploiting people.\n\n1:51:02.920 --> 1:51:05.840\n You cannot because you'll be laughed.\n\n1:51:05.840 --> 1:51:06.880\n Nobody will deal with you.\n\n1:51:06.880 --> 1:51:09.160\n Nobody will have any interactions with you.\n\n1:51:09.160 --> 1:51:10.640\n The only way to become a billionaire\n\n1:51:10.640 --> 1:51:14.180\n is to do billions of win, win transactions.\n\n1:51:15.340 --> 1:51:18.440\n So the only way to become a billionaire in a free society\n\n1:51:18.440 --> 1:51:21.720\n is to change the world to make it a better place.\n\n1:51:21.720 --> 1:51:24.640\n Billionaires are the great humanitarians of our time,\n\n1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:26.360\n not because they give charity,\n\n1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:29.200\n but because they make them billions.\n\n1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:32.760\n And it's true that money and genius\n\n1:51:32.760 --> 1:51:35.420\n are not necessarily correlated,\n\n1:51:35.420 --> 1:51:37.360\n but you cannot become a billionaire\n\n1:51:37.360 --> 1:51:38.960\n without being super smart.\n\n1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:42.380\n You cannot become a billionaire by figuring something out\n\n1:51:42.380 --> 1:51:44.560\n that nobody else has figured out\n\n1:51:44.560 --> 1:51:46.160\n in whatever realm it happens to be.\n\n1:51:46.160 --> 1:51:48.400\n And that thing that you figure out\n\n1:51:48.400 --> 1:51:50.700\n has to be something that provides immense value\n\n1:51:50.700 --> 1:51:51.540\n to other people.\n\n1:51:52.440 --> 1:51:54.400\n Where do we go wrong?\n\n1:51:54.400 --> 1:51:56.760\n We go wrong, our culture goes wrong\n\n1:51:56.760 --> 1:52:01.760\n because it views billionaires as selfish.\n\n1:52:02.700 --> 1:52:04.120\n And there's a sense in which,\n\n1:52:04.120 --> 1:52:06.380\n not a sense, it's absolutely true.\n\n1:52:06.380 --> 1:52:08.680\n The billionaire doesn't ask for my opinion\n\n1:52:08.680 --> 1:52:11.540\n on what product to launch.\n\n1:52:11.540 --> 1:52:13.880\n Elon Musk doesn't ask others\n\n1:52:13.880 --> 1:52:15.960\n what they think he should spend his money on,\n\n1:52:15.960 --> 1:52:18.560\n what the greatest social wellbeing will be.\n\n1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:21.920\n I mean, there's a sense in which the rockets are his toys.\n\n1:52:21.920 --> 1:52:24.520\n There's a sense in which he chose\n\n1:52:24.520 --> 1:52:28.280\n that he would be inspired the most.\n\n1:52:28.280 --> 1:52:30.200\n He would have the most fun\n\n1:52:30.200 --> 1:52:32.720\n by going to Mars and building rockets.\n\n1:52:32.720 --> 1:52:34.480\n And he's probably dreamt of rockets\n\n1:52:34.480 --> 1:52:35.440\n from when he was a kid\n\n1:52:35.440 --> 1:52:37.400\n and probably always played with rockets.\n\n1:52:37.400 --> 1:52:39.080\n And now he has the funds, the capital\n\n1:52:39.080 --> 1:52:40.760\n to be able to deploy it.\n\n1:52:40.760 --> 1:52:43.860\n So he's being selfish.\n\n1:52:43.860 --> 1:52:45.620\n Obviously, he's being self interested.\n\n1:52:45.620 --> 1:52:47.280\n This is what Elon Musk is about.\n\n1:52:47.280 --> 1:52:50.440\n I mean, the same with Jeff Bezos.\n\n1:52:50.440 --> 1:52:54.920\n There's no committee to decide whether to invest\n\n1:52:54.920 --> 1:52:57.000\n in cloud computing or not.\n\n1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:58.960\n Bezos decided that.\n\n1:52:58.960 --> 1:53:00.840\n And at the end of the day,\n\n1:53:00.840 --> 1:53:01.880\n they are the bosses,\n\n1:53:01.880 --> 1:53:03.740\n they pursue the values they believe are good.\n\n1:53:03.740 --> 1:53:06.080\n They create the wealth.\n\n1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:08.960\n It's their decisions, it's their mind.\n\n1:53:08.960 --> 1:53:10.980\n And the fact is we live in a world\n\n1:53:10.980 --> 1:53:14.500\n where for 2000 plus years,\n\n1:53:14.500 --> 1:53:18.160\n self interest, even though we all do it,\n\n1:53:18.160 --> 1:53:20.600\n just more extent to the less,\n\n1:53:20.600 --> 1:53:23.980\n we deem it as morally apparent.\n\n1:53:23.980 --> 1:53:24.960\n It's bad.\n\n1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:26.120\n It's wrong.\n\n1:53:26.120 --> 1:53:28.180\n I mean, your mother probably taught you the same thing\n\n1:53:28.180 --> 1:53:29.220\n my mother taught me.\n\n1:53:29.220 --> 1:53:30.960\n Think of others first.\n\n1:53:30.960 --> 1:53:32.740\n Think of yourself last.\n\n1:53:32.740 --> 1:53:35.680\n The good stuff is kept for the guests.\n\n1:53:35.680 --> 1:53:38.340\n You never get to use the good stuff.\n\n1:53:38.340 --> 1:53:39.700\n It's others.\n\n1:53:39.700 --> 1:53:41.560\n That's what the focus of morality is.\n\n1:53:41.560 --> 1:53:44.940\n Now, no mother, even no Jewish mother\n\n1:53:44.940 --> 1:53:46.920\n actually believes that, right?\n\n1:53:46.920 --> 1:53:50.640\n Because they don't really want you to be last.\n\n1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:53.480\n They want you to be first and they push you to be first.\n\n1:53:53.480 --> 1:53:56.400\n But morally, they've been taught their entire lives\n\n1:53:56.400 --> 1:53:59.800\n and they believe that the right thing to say\n\n1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:01.240\n and to some extent do\n\n1:54:01.240 --> 1:54:06.240\n is to argue for sacrifice for other people, right?\n\n1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:11.020\n So most people, 99% of people are torn.\n\n1:54:12.420 --> 1:54:17.420\n They know they should be selfless,\n\n1:54:17.920 --> 1:54:20.000\n sacrifice, live for other people.\n\n1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:21.920\n They don't really want to.\n\n1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:25.020\n So they act selfishly in their day to day life\n\n1:54:25.020 --> 1:54:28.460\n and they feel guilty and they can't be happy.\n\n1:54:28.460 --> 1:54:29.300\n They can't be happy.\n\n1:54:29.300 --> 1:54:31.480\n And Jewish mothers and Catholic mothers are excellent\n\n1:54:31.480 --> 1:54:33.920\n at using that guilt to manipulate you.\n\n1:54:33.920 --> 1:54:35.120\n But the guilt is inevitable\n\n1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:38.360\n because you've got these two conflicting things,\n\n1:54:38.360 --> 1:54:39.360\n the way you want to live\n\n1:54:39.360 --> 1:54:42.020\n and the way you've been taught to live.\n\n1:54:42.020 --> 1:54:45.500\n And what objectivism does is that at the end of the day\n\n1:54:45.500 --> 1:54:49.180\n provides you with a way to unite morality,\n\n1:54:49.180 --> 1:54:52.720\n a proper morality with what you want\n\n1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:55.080\n and to think about what you really want,\n\n1:54:55.080 --> 1:54:58.160\n to conceptualize what you really want properly.\n\n1:54:58.160 --> 1:55:00.080\n So what you want is really good for you\n\n1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:03.360\n and what you want will really lead to your happiness.\n\n1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:06.760\n So, you know, we reject the idea of sacrifice.\n\n1:55:06.760 --> 1:55:08.480\n We reject the idea of living for other people,\n\n1:55:08.480 --> 1:55:13.480\n but you see, if you believe that the purpose of morality\n\n1:55:14.120 --> 1:55:16.080\n is to sacrifice for other people\n\n1:55:17.220 --> 1:55:18.760\n and you look at Jeff Bezos,\n\n1:55:19.760 --> 1:55:22.120\n when was the last time he sacrificed anything, right?\n\n1:55:22.120 --> 1:55:23.520\n He was living pretty well.\n\n1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:26.220\n He's got billions that he could give it all away\n\n1:55:26.220 --> 1:55:27.680\n and yet he doesn't.\n\n1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:28.800\n How dare he?\n\n1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:32.940\n You know, in my talks, I often position,\n\n1:55:34.180 --> 1:55:35.200\n and I'm gonna use Bill Gates,\n\n1:55:35.200 --> 1:55:37.960\n sorry guys, drop the conspiracy theory.\n\n1:55:37.960 --> 1:55:41.320\n They're all BS, complete and utter nonsense.\n\n1:55:41.320 --> 1:55:42.920\n There's not a shred of truth.\n\n1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:45.480\n You know, I disagree with Bill Gates\n\n1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:47.420\n on everything political.\n\n1:55:47.420 --> 1:55:50.980\n I think he politically is a complete ignoramus,\n\n1:55:50.980 --> 1:55:54.160\n but the guy's a genius when it comes to technology\n\n1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:57.960\n and he's just thoughtful even in this philanthropy.\n\n1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:00.300\n He just uses his mind and I respect that\n\n1:56:00.300 --> 1:56:01.680\n even though politically he's terrible.\n\n1:56:01.680 --> 1:56:04.000\n Anyway, think about this.\n\n1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.880\n Who had a bigger impact on the lives\n\n1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:08.520\n of poor people in the world?\n\n1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:10.380\n Bill Gates or Mother Teresa?\n\n1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:12.600\n Bill Gates.\n\n1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:13.440\n It's not even close.\n\n1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:17.400\n And Mother Teresa lived this altruistic life to the core.\n\n1:56:17.400 --> 1:56:19.200\n She lived it consistently.\n\n1:56:19.200 --> 1:56:21.680\n And yet she was miserable, pathetic, horrible.\n\n1:56:21.680 --> 1:56:22.940\n She hated her life.\n\n1:56:22.940 --> 1:56:25.200\n She was miserable.\n\n1:56:25.200 --> 1:56:27.480\n And most of the people she helped didn't do very well\n\n1:56:27.480 --> 1:56:30.760\n because she just helped them not die, right?\n\n1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:32.800\n And then Bill Gates changed the world\n\n1:56:32.800 --> 1:56:35.080\n and he helped a lot by providing technology.\n\n1:56:35.080 --> 1:56:37.160\n We even, philanthropy gets to them.\n\n1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:39.560\n The food gets them, much fancier, more efficient.\n\n1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:40.960\n Yet who is the moral saint?\n\n1:56:42.240 --> 1:56:44.640\n Sainthood is not determined based on\n\n1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:46.120\n what you do for other people.\n\n1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:49.100\n Sainthood is based on how much pain you suffer.\n\n1:56:50.180 --> 1:56:52.080\n I like to ask people to go to a museum\n\n1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:54.640\n and look at all the paintings of saints.\n\n1:56:54.640 --> 1:56:57.420\n How many of them are smiling and are happy?\n\n1:56:57.420 --> 1:56:59.260\n They've usually got arrows through them\n\n1:56:59.260 --> 1:57:00.760\n and holes in their body\n\n1:57:00.760 --> 1:57:02.720\n and they're just suffering a horrible death.\n\n1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:05.160\n The whole point of the morality we are taught\n\n1:57:06.360 --> 1:57:10.120\n is that happiness is immorality,\n\n1:57:11.800 --> 1:57:15.200\n that happy people cannot be good people,\n\n1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:17.280\n and that good people suffer\n\n1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:20.760\n and that suffering is necessary for morality.\n\n1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:25.040\n Morality is about self sacrifice and suffering.\n\n1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:28.400\n And at the end of the day,\n\n1:57:28.400 --> 1:57:30.000\n almost all the problems in the world\n\n1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:34.160\n boil down to that false view.\n\n1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:37.580\n So can we try to talk about,\n\n1:57:37.580 --> 1:57:39.840\n part of it is the problem of the word selfishness,\n\n1:57:39.840 --> 1:57:42.920\n but let's talk about the virtue of selfishness.\n\n1:57:42.920 --> 1:57:45.160\n So let's start at the fact that for me,\n\n1:57:45.160 --> 1:57:48.120\n I really enjoy doing stuff for other people.\n\n1:57:48.120 --> 1:57:53.120\n I enjoy cheering on the success of others.\n\n1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:55.400\n Why?\n\n1:57:55.400 --> 1:57:56.440\n I don't know.\n\n1:57:56.440 --> 1:57:57.280\n It's deep in that.\n\n1:57:57.280 --> 1:57:58.100\n Well, think about it.\n\n1:57:58.100 --> 1:57:59.240\n Why?\n\n1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:01.400\n Because I think you do know.\n\n1:58:01.400 --> 1:58:03.600\n If I were to really think,\n\n1:58:05.800 --> 1:58:08.640\n I don't want to resort to like evolutionary arguments\n\n1:58:08.640 --> 1:58:10.360\n or like this is somehow different.\n\n1:58:10.360 --> 1:58:13.040\n So I think.\n\n1:58:14.040 --> 1:58:16.960\n So I can tell you why I enjoy helping others.\n\n1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:18.200\n Maybe you can go there.\n\n1:58:18.200 --> 1:58:19.120\n Like one thing,\n\n1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:21.120\n cause we should talk about love a little bit.\n\n1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:23.000\n I'll tell you there's a part of me\n\n1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:26.640\n that's a little bit not rational.\n\n1:58:26.640 --> 1:58:29.600\n Like there's a gut that I follow\n\n1:58:29.600 --> 1:58:32.520\n that not everything I do is perfectly rational.\n\n1:58:32.520 --> 1:58:36.600\n For example, my dad criticizes me.\n\n1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:38.680\n He says like, you should always have a plan.\n\n1:58:38.680 --> 1:58:40.040\n Like it should make sense.\n\n1:58:40.040 --> 1:58:41.360\n You have a strategy.\n\n1:58:41.360 --> 1:58:44.120\n And I say that,\n\n1:58:44.120 --> 1:58:46.680\n I left, I stepped down from my full salary position\n\n1:58:46.680 --> 1:58:47.840\n at MIT.\n\n1:58:47.840 --> 1:58:50.160\n There's so many things I did without like a plan.\n\n1:58:50.160 --> 1:58:51.040\n It's a gut.\n\n1:58:51.040 --> 1:58:53.640\n It's like, I want to start a company.\n\n1:58:53.640 --> 1:58:55.320\n Well, you know how many companies fail?\n\n1:58:55.320 --> 1:58:56.160\n I don't know.\n\n1:58:56.160 --> 1:58:58.800\n It's a gut.\n\n1:58:58.800 --> 1:59:02.600\n And the same thing with being kind to others is a gut.\n\n1:59:02.600 --> 1:59:06.440\n I watched the way that karma works in this world\n\n1:59:06.440 --> 1:59:07.840\n that the people like us,\n\n1:59:07.840 --> 1:59:09.880\n one guy I look up to is Joe Rogan,\n\n1:59:09.880 --> 1:59:12.200\n that he does stuff for others.\n\n1:59:12.200 --> 1:59:15.360\n And that the joy he experiences,\n\n1:59:15.360 --> 1:59:16.800\n the way he sees the world,\n\n1:59:16.800 --> 1:59:20.760\n like just the glimmer in his eyes\n\n1:59:20.760 --> 1:59:22.600\n because he does stuff for others\n\n1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:24.200\n that creates a joyful experience.\n\n1:59:24.200 --> 1:59:27.760\n And that somehow seems to be an instructive way to,\n\n1:59:27.760 --> 1:59:31.520\n that to me is inspiring of a life well lived.\n\n1:59:31.520 --> 1:59:32.960\n But you probably know a lot of people\n\n1:59:32.960 --> 1:59:35.360\n who have done stuff for others who are not happy.\n\n1:59:36.640 --> 1:59:37.960\n True.\n\n1:59:37.960 --> 1:59:39.920\n So I don't think it's the doing stuff for others\n\n1:59:39.920 --> 1:59:41.080\n that just brings the happiness.\n\n1:59:41.080 --> 1:59:42.480\n It's why you do stuff for others\n\n1:59:42.480 --> 1:59:44.120\n and what else you're doing in your life\n\n1:59:44.120 --> 1:59:48.400\n and what is the proportion.\n\n1:59:48.400 --> 1:59:51.240\n But it's why at the end of the day, which is,\n\n1:59:51.240 --> 1:59:52.360\n and it's the same.\n\n1:59:52.360 --> 1:59:55.240\n Look, you can maybe through a gut feeling say,\n\n1:59:55.240 --> 1:59:56.680\n I wanna start a company,\n\n1:59:56.680 --> 1:59:57.960\n but you better start doing thinking\n\n1:59:57.960 --> 2:00:00.480\n about how and what and all of that.\n\n2:00:00.480 --> 2:00:01.800\n And to some extent the why,\n\n2:00:01.800 --> 2:00:03.760\n because if you really wanna be happy doing this,\n\n2:00:03.760 --> 2:00:06.760\n you better make sure you're doing it for the right reason.\n\n2:00:06.760 --> 2:00:08.280\n So I'm not, you know,\n\n2:00:08.280 --> 2:00:10.280\n there's something called fast thinking,\n\n2:00:10.280 --> 2:00:14.400\n Carlman, the Daniel Kahneman.\n\n2:00:14.400 --> 2:00:15.640\n Daniel Kahneman talks about,\n\n2:00:15.640 --> 2:00:19.560\n and there is, it's, you know,\n\n2:00:19.560 --> 2:00:21.960\n all the integrations you've made so far in your life\n\n2:00:21.960 --> 2:00:25.080\n cause you to have specialized knowledge and certain things\n\n2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:27.080\n and you can think very fast\n\n2:00:27.080 --> 2:00:31.440\n and your gut tells you what the right answer is.\n\n2:00:31.440 --> 2:00:34.800\n But it's not, it's your mind is constantly evaluating\n\n2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:35.960\n and constantly working.\n\n2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:39.280\n You wanna make it as rational as you can,\n\n2:00:39.280 --> 2:00:41.000\n not in the sense that I have to think through\n\n2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:42.480\n every time I make a decision,\n\n2:00:42.480 --> 2:00:45.880\n but that they've so programmed my mind in a sense\n\n2:00:45.880 --> 2:00:48.880\n that the answers are the right answers,\n\n2:00:48.880 --> 2:00:51.440\n you know, when I get them.\n\n2:00:53.720 --> 2:00:58.720\n So, you know, I like, I view other people as a value.\n\n2:01:00.640 --> 2:01:02.880\n Other people contribute enormously to my life,\n\n2:01:04.200 --> 2:01:07.320\n whether it's a romantic love relationship\n\n2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:09.400\n or whether it's a friendship relationship\n\n2:01:09.400 --> 2:01:12.520\n or whether it's just, you know,\n\n2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:14.960\n Jeff Bezos creating Amazon\n\n2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:18.480\n and delivering goodies to my home when I get them.\n\n2:01:18.480 --> 2:01:20.600\n And people do all that, right?\n\n2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:22.120\n It's not just Jeff Bezos.\n\n2:01:22.120 --> 2:01:23.040\n He gets the most credit,\n\n2:01:23.040 --> 2:01:24.720\n but everybody in that chain of command,\n\n2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:27.320\n everybody at Amazon is working for me.\n\n2:01:27.320 --> 2:01:28.520\n I love that.\n\n2:01:28.520 --> 2:01:31.520\n I love the idea of a human being.\n\n2:01:31.520 --> 2:01:34.520\n I love the idea that there are people capable\n\n2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:37.600\n of being an Einstein, of being, you know,\n\n2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:40.400\n and creating and building and making stuff\n\n2:01:40.400 --> 2:01:42.400\n that makes my life so good.\n\n2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:45.480\n You know, most of us like,\n\n2:01:45.480 --> 2:01:47.440\n this is not a good room for an example.\n\n2:01:47.440 --> 2:01:50.000\n Most of us like plants, right?\n\n2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:51.400\n We like pets.\n\n2:01:51.400 --> 2:01:53.240\n I don't particularly, but people like pets.\n\n2:01:53.240 --> 2:01:54.080\n Why?\n\n2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:55.720\n We like to see life.\n\n2:01:57.120 --> 2:01:59.800\n Human beings are life on steroids, right?\n\n2:01:59.800 --> 2:02:01.040\n They're life with a brain.\n\n2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:03.560\n It's amazing, right, what they can do.\n\n2:02:03.560 --> 2:02:05.240\n I love people.\n\n2:02:05.240 --> 2:02:07.160\n Now that doesn't mean I love everybody\n\n2:02:07.160 --> 2:02:08.040\n because there's some,\n\n2:02:08.040 --> 2:02:10.680\n there are really bad people out there who I hate, right?\n\n2:02:10.680 --> 2:02:11.960\n And I do hate.\n\n2:02:11.960 --> 2:02:14.120\n And there are people out there that are just,\n\n2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:15.520\n I have no opinion about.\n\n2:02:15.520 --> 2:02:18.680\n But generally the idea of a human being\n\n2:02:18.680 --> 2:02:20.000\n to me is a phenomenal idea.\n\n2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.600\n When I see a baby, I light up\n\n2:02:22.600 --> 2:02:26.040\n because to me there's a potential, you know,\n\n2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:29.600\n there's this magnificent potential\n\n2:02:29.600 --> 2:02:31.080\n that is embodied in that.\n\n2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:34.080\n And when I see people struggling and need help,\n\n2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:36.600\n I think they're human beings.\n\n2:02:36.600 --> 2:02:38.600\n You know, they embody that potential.\n\n2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:40.760\n They embody that goodness.\n\n2:02:40.760 --> 2:02:43.200\n They might turn out to be bad,\n\n2:02:43.200 --> 2:02:45.320\n but why would I ever give the presumption of that?\n\n2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:46.920\n I give them the presumption of the positive\n\n2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:48.840\n and I cheer them on.\n\n2:02:48.840 --> 2:02:52.120\n And I enjoy watching people succeed.\n\n2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:54.720\n I enjoy watching people get to the top of the mountain\n\n2:02:54.720 --> 2:02:56.080\n and produce something.\n\n2:02:56.080 --> 2:02:59.040\n Even if I don't get anything directly from it,\n\n2:02:59.040 --> 2:03:03.320\n I enjoy that because it's part of my enjoyment of life.\n\n2:03:03.320 --> 2:03:08.240\n So the word, to you, the morality of selfishness,\n\n2:03:08.240 --> 2:03:10.320\n this kind of love of other human beings,\n\n2:03:10.320 --> 2:03:13.840\n the love of life fits into a morality of selfishness.\n\n2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:18.760\n Cannot, because there's no context\n\n2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:21.880\n in which you can truly love yourself\n\n2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:24.880\n without loving life and loving what it means to be human.\n\n2:03:24.880 --> 2:03:28.880\n So, you know, the love of yourself is gonna manifest itself\n\n2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:31.560\n definitely in different people, but it's core.\n\n2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:33.360\n What do you love about yourself?\n\n2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:35.880\n First of all, I love that I'm alive.\n\n2:03:35.880 --> 2:03:39.600\n I love this world and the opportunities it provides me\n\n2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:43.640\n and the fun and the excitement of discovering something new\n\n2:03:43.640 --> 2:03:46.920\n and meeting a new person and having a conversation.\n\n2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:51.200\n You know, all of this is immensely enjoyable,\n\n2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:54.120\n but behind all of that is a particular human character.\n\n2:03:54.120 --> 2:03:55.600\n There's a particular human capability\n\n2:03:55.600 --> 2:03:57.880\n that not only I have, other people have.\n\n2:03:57.880 --> 2:03:59.960\n And the fact that they have it makes my life\n\n2:03:59.960 --> 2:04:03.680\n so much more fun because, so it's,\n\n2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:07.360\n you cannot view, you know, it's all integrated\n\n2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:09.320\n and you cannot view yourself in isolation.\n\n2:04:09.320 --> 2:04:13.240\n Now that doesn't place a moral commandment on me,\n\n2:04:14.680 --> 2:04:16.520\n help everybody who's poor\n\n2:04:16.520 --> 2:04:18.600\n that you happen to meet in the street.\n\n2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:21.560\n It doesn't place a burden on me in a sense\n\n2:04:21.560 --> 2:04:25.640\n that now I have this moral duty to help everybody.\n\n2:04:25.640 --> 2:04:27.800\n It leaves me free to make decisions\n\n2:04:27.800 --> 2:04:28.920\n about who I help and who I don't.\n\n2:04:28.920 --> 2:04:31.560\n There's some people who I will not help.\n\n2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:35.520\n There's some people who I do not wish positive things upon.\n\n2:04:36.680 --> 2:04:39.480\n Bad people should have bad outcomes.\n\n2:04:39.480 --> 2:04:41.800\n Bad people should suffer.\n\n2:04:41.800 --> 2:04:42.640\n So.\n\n2:04:42.640 --> 2:04:44.720\n And then you have the freedom to choose who's good,\n\n2:04:44.720 --> 2:04:45.560\n who's bad within your.\n\n2:04:45.560 --> 2:04:47.720\n It's your decision based on your values.\n\n2:04:47.720 --> 2:04:49.760\n Now, I think there's an objectivity to it.\n\n2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:52.080\n There's a standard by which you should evaluate\n\n2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:53.080\n good versus bad.\n\n2:04:53.080 --> 2:04:55.000\n And that standard should be to what extent\n\n2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:57.560\n do they contribute or hurt human life?\n\n2:04:57.560 --> 2:04:59.600\n The standard is human life.\n\n2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:01.560\n And so when I say, look at Jeff Bezos,\n\n2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:04.200\n I say, he's contributed to human life, good guy.\n\n2:05:04.200 --> 2:05:05.840\n I might disagree with him on stuff.\n\n2:05:05.840 --> 2:05:07.240\n We might disagree about politics.\n\n2:05:07.240 --> 2:05:08.920\n We might disagree about women.\n\n2:05:08.920 --> 2:05:10.280\n I don't know what we agree.\n\n2:05:10.280 --> 2:05:15.280\n But overall, big picture, he is pro life, right?\n\n2:05:15.320 --> 2:05:19.440\n I look at somebody like, you know, to take like 99.9%\n\n2:05:19.440 --> 2:05:22.800\n of our politicians and they are pro death.\n\n2:05:23.880 --> 2:05:25.520\n They're pro destruction.\n\n2:05:25.520 --> 2:05:29.320\n They're pro cutting corners in ways that destroy human life\n\n2:05:29.320 --> 2:05:31.160\n and human potential and human ability.\n\n2:05:31.160 --> 2:05:34.240\n So I literally hate almost every politician out there.\n\n2:05:35.440 --> 2:05:38.000\n And I wish ill on them, right?\n\n2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:40.120\n I don't want them to be successful or happy.\n\n2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:42.200\n I want them all to go away, right?\n\n2:05:42.200 --> 2:05:43.040\n Leave me alone.\n\n2:05:43.040 --> 2:05:45.200\n So I believe in justice.\n\n2:05:45.200 --> 2:05:46.760\n I believe good things should happen to good people\n\n2:05:46.760 --> 2:05:47.920\n and bad things should happen to bad people.\n\n2:05:47.920 --> 2:05:52.560\n So I make those generalizations based on this one,\n\n2:05:52.560 --> 2:05:54.080\n you know, on the other hand, if, you know,\n\n2:05:54.080 --> 2:05:55.680\n I shouldn't say all politicians, right?\n\n2:05:55.680 --> 2:05:57.520\n So if I, you know, I love Thomas Jefferson\n\n2:05:57.520 --> 2:05:59.360\n and George Washington, right?\n\n2:05:59.360 --> 2:06:00.520\n I love Abraham Lincoln.\n\n2:06:00.520 --> 2:06:02.680\n I love people who fought for freedom\n\n2:06:02.680 --> 2:06:04.720\n and who believed in freedom, who had these ideas\n\n2:06:04.720 --> 2:06:07.520\n and lived up to, at least in parts of their lives,\n\n2:06:07.520 --> 2:06:08.360\n to those principles.\n\n2:06:08.360 --> 2:06:10.360\n Now, do I think Thomas Jefferson was flawed\n\n2:06:10.360 --> 2:06:11.280\n because he held slaves?\n\n2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:12.880\n Absolutely.\n\n2:06:12.880 --> 2:06:15.520\n But the virtues way outweigh that in my view.\n\n2:06:15.520 --> 2:06:17.560\n And I understand people who don't accept that.\n\n2:06:17.560 --> 2:06:19.280\n You don't have to also love\n\n2:06:19.280 --> 2:06:21.080\n and hate the entirety of the person.\n\n2:06:21.080 --> 2:06:23.360\n There's parts of that person that you're attracted to.\n\n2:06:23.360 --> 2:06:26.520\n The major part is pro life and therefore I'm pro that person.\n\n2:06:26.520 --> 2:06:28.520\n And I think, and I said earlier\n\n2:06:28.520 --> 2:06:30.040\n that objectivism is a philosophy of love.\n\n2:06:30.040 --> 2:06:35.040\n And I believe that because objectivism is about your life,\n\n2:06:35.440 --> 2:06:38.240\n about loving your life, about embracing your life,\n\n2:06:38.240 --> 2:06:39.960\n about engaging with the world,\n\n2:06:39.960 --> 2:06:42.600\n about loving the world in which you live,\n\n2:06:42.600 --> 2:06:44.800\n about win win relationships with other people,\n\n2:06:44.800 --> 2:06:48.280\n which means to a large extent loving the good\n\n2:06:48.280 --> 2:06:50.720\n in other people and the best in other people\n\n2:06:50.720 --> 2:06:52.280\n and encouraging that and supporting that\n\n2:06:52.280 --> 2:06:53.440\n and promoting that.\n\n2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:56.440\n So I know selfishness is a harsh word\n\n2:06:56.440 --> 2:06:58.960\n because the culture has given it that harshness.\n\n2:06:58.960 --> 2:07:00.320\n Selfishness is a harsh word\n\n2:07:00.320 --> 2:07:01.920\n because the people who don't like selfishness\n\n2:07:01.920 --> 2:07:04.240\n want you to believe it's a harsh word.\n\n2:07:04.240 --> 2:07:05.640\n But it's not.\n\n2:07:05.640 --> 2:07:06.560\n What does it mean?\n\n2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:09.000\n It means focus on self.\n\n2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:10.840\n It means take care of self.\n\n2:07:10.840 --> 2:07:13.360\n It means make yourself your highest priority,\n\n2:07:13.360 --> 2:07:14.880\n not your only priority,\n\n2:07:14.880 --> 2:07:16.720\n because in taking care of self,\n\n2:07:16.720 --> 2:07:20.320\n what would I be without my wife?\n\n2:07:20.320 --> 2:07:24.440\n What would I be without the people who support me,\n\n2:07:24.440 --> 2:07:28.520\n who help me, who I have these love relationships with?\n\n2:07:30.280 --> 2:07:31.880\n So other people are crucial.\n\n2:07:31.880 --> 2:07:36.880\n What would my life be without Steve Jobs, right?\n\n2:07:36.920 --> 2:07:41.360\n A lot of things you mentioned here are just beautiful.\n\n2:07:41.360 --> 2:07:42.840\n So one is win win.\n\n2:07:42.840 --> 2:07:45.800\n So one key thing about this selfishness\n\n2:07:45.800 --> 2:07:48.720\n and the idea of objectivism is the philosophy of love\n\n2:07:48.720 --> 2:07:52.240\n is that you don't want parasitism.\n\n2:07:52.240 --> 2:07:54.400\n So that is unethical.\n\n2:07:54.400 --> 2:07:58.320\n So you actually, first of all, you say win win a lot.\n\n2:07:58.320 --> 2:08:00.240\n And I just like that terminology\n\n2:08:00.240 --> 2:08:02.280\n because it's a good way to see life.\n\n2:08:02.280 --> 2:08:06.560\n It's tried to maximize the number of win win interactions.\n\n2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:08.320\n That's a good way to see business actually.\n\n2:08:08.320 --> 2:08:10.920\n Well, life generally, I think every aspect of life,\n\n2:08:10.920 --> 2:08:13.800\n you wanna have a win win relationship with your wife.\n\n2:08:13.800 --> 2:08:16.000\n Imagine if it was win lose.\n\n2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:18.200\n Either way, if you win and she loses,\n\n2:08:18.200 --> 2:08:20.440\n how long is that gonna sustain?\n\n2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:25.200\n So win lose relationships are not in equilibrium.\n\n2:08:25.200 --> 2:08:27.080\n What they turn into is lose lose.\n\n2:08:27.080 --> 2:08:29.800\n Like win lose turns into lose lose.\n\n2:08:29.800 --> 2:08:34.280\n And so the only alternative to lose lose is win win.\n\n2:08:34.280 --> 2:08:36.880\n And you win and the person you love wins.\n\n2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:38.440\n What's better than that, right?\n\n2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:42.480\n That's the way to maximize, so like the selfishness\n\n2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:44.480\n is you're trying to maximize the win,\n\n2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:48.200\n but the way to maximize the win is to maximize the win win.\n\n2:08:48.200 --> 2:08:49.600\n Yes, and it turns out,\n\n2:08:49.600 --> 2:08:51.800\n and Adam Smith understood this a long time ago,\n\n2:08:51.800 --> 2:08:54.080\n that if you focus on your own winning\n\n2:08:55.360 --> 2:08:57.960\n while respecting other people as human beings,\n\n2:08:57.960 --> 2:08:59.120\n then everybody wins.\n\n2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:00.240\n And the beauty of capitalism,\n\n2:09:00.240 --> 2:09:02.200\n if we go back to capitalism for a second,\n\n2:09:02.200 --> 2:09:05.080\n the beauty of capitalism is you cannot be successful\n\n2:09:05.080 --> 2:09:08.800\n in capitalism without producing values\n\n2:09:08.800 --> 2:09:10.240\n that other people appreciate\n\n2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:12.120\n and therefore willing to buy from you.\n\n2:09:12.120 --> 2:09:14.960\n And they buy them, and this goes back to that question\n\n2:09:14.960 --> 2:09:16.520\n about the engineer and Steve Jobs.\n\n2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:18.960\n Why is the engineer working there?\n\n2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:22.560\n Because he's getting paid more than his time is worth to him.\n\n2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:24.280\n I know people don't like to think in those terms,\n\n2:09:24.280 --> 2:09:25.720\n but that's the reality.\n\n2:09:25.720 --> 2:09:27.960\n If his time is worth more to him than what he's getting paid,\n\n2:09:27.960 --> 2:09:28.800\n he would leave.\n\n2:09:29.880 --> 2:09:30.840\n So he's winning.\n\n2:09:32.160 --> 2:09:33.120\n And is Apple winning?\n\n2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:35.280\n Yes, because they're getting more productivity from him.\n\n2:09:35.280 --> 2:09:36.600\n They're getting more from him\n\n2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:39.800\n than what he's actually producing.\n\n2:09:40.920 --> 2:09:44.120\n It's tough because there's the human psychology\n\n2:09:44.120 --> 2:09:45.720\n and imperfect information.\n\n2:09:45.720 --> 2:09:47.840\n It just makes it a little messier\n\n2:09:47.840 --> 2:09:50.360\n than the clarity of thinking you have about this.\n\n2:09:50.360 --> 2:09:54.240\n It's just, you know, because for sure,\n\n2:09:54.240 --> 2:09:56.920\n but not everything in life is an economic transaction.\n\n2:09:56.920 --> 2:10:00.520\n It ultimately is close, but it...\n\n2:10:00.520 --> 2:10:02.240\n Even if it's not an economic transaction,\n\n2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:05.560\n even if it's a relationship transaction,\n\n2:10:05.560 --> 2:10:08.640\n when you get to a point with a friend\n\n2:10:08.640 --> 2:10:11.400\n where you're not gaining from the relationship,\n\n2:10:11.400 --> 2:10:12.560\n friendship's gonna be over.\n\n2:10:12.560 --> 2:10:14.720\n Not immediately, because it takes time for these things\n\n2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:17.200\n to manifest itself and to really absorb and to...\n\n2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:20.200\n But we change friendships, we change our loves, right?\n\n2:10:20.200 --> 2:10:22.000\n We fall in and out of love.\n\n2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:23.920\n We fall out of love because we're not...\n\n2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:27.000\n Love, so let's go back to love, right?\n\n2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:29.160\n Love is the most selfish of all emotions.\n\n2:10:29.160 --> 2:10:31.920\n Love is about what you do to me, right?\n\n2:10:31.920 --> 2:10:34.360\n So I love my wife because she makes me feel better\n\n2:10:34.360 --> 2:10:35.200\n about myself.\n\n2:10:36.520 --> 2:10:40.520\n So, you know, the idea of selfless love is bizarre.\n\n2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:44.960\n So Ayn Rand used to say, before you say, I love you,\n\n2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:46.280\n you have to say the I.\n\n2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:50.480\n And you have to know who you are\n\n2:10:50.480 --> 2:10:52.080\n and you have to appreciate yourself.\n\n2:10:52.080 --> 2:10:53.520\n If you hate yourself,\n\n2:10:53.520 --> 2:10:55.520\n what does it mean to love somebody else?\n\n2:10:55.520 --> 2:10:58.560\n So I love my wife because she makes me feel great\n\n2:10:58.560 --> 2:10:59.400\n about the world.\n\n2:11:00.400 --> 2:11:02.520\n And she loves me for the same reason.\n\n2:11:02.520 --> 2:11:05.640\n And so Ayn Rand used to use this example.\n\n2:11:05.640 --> 2:11:10.360\n Imagine you go up to be spoused the night before the wedding\n\n2:11:10.360 --> 2:11:14.680\n and you say, you know, I get nothing out of this relationship.\n\n2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:18.680\n I'm doing this purely as an act of noble self sacrifice.\n\n2:11:18.680 --> 2:11:23.120\n She would slap you, as she should, right?\n\n2:11:23.120 --> 2:11:27.760\n So, you know, we know this intuitively that love is selfish,\n\n2:11:27.760 --> 2:11:29.800\n but we are afraid to admit it to ourselves.\n\n2:11:29.800 --> 2:11:30.640\n And why?\n\n2:11:30.640 --> 2:11:33.000\n Because the other side has convinced us\n\n2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:36.520\n that selfishness is associated with exploiting other people.\n\n2:11:36.520 --> 2:11:39.240\n Selfishness means lying, cheating, stealing,\n\n2:11:39.240 --> 2:11:42.160\n walking on corpses, backstabbing people.\n\n2:11:43.360 --> 2:11:47.800\n But is that ever in your self interest truly, right?\n\n2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:50.240\n You know, I'll often be in front of an audience to say,\n\n2:11:50.240 --> 2:11:52.320\n okay, how many people have you ever been in a relationship\n\n2:11:52.320 --> 2:11:54.600\n and say, okay, how many people here have lied?\n\n2:11:54.600 --> 2:11:57.040\n I'm kidding, right?\n\n2:11:57.040 --> 2:12:00.840\n How many of you think that if you did that consistently,\n\n2:12:00.840 --> 2:12:02.480\n that would make your life better?\n\n2:12:03.360 --> 2:12:04.960\n Nobody thinks that, right?\n\n2:12:04.960 --> 2:12:09.800\n Because everybody's experienced how shitty lying,\n\n2:12:09.800 --> 2:12:11.360\n not because of how it makes you feel\n\n2:12:11.360 --> 2:12:12.480\n out of a sense of guilt.\n\n2:12:12.480 --> 2:12:15.320\n Existentially, it's just a bad strategy, right?\n\n2:12:15.320 --> 2:12:18.200\n You get caught, you have to create other lies\n\n2:12:18.200 --> 2:12:19.920\n to cover up the previous lie.\n\n2:12:19.920 --> 2:12:23.800\n It screws up with your own psychology and your own cognition.\n\n2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:27.880\n You know, the mind, to some extent, like a computer, right,\n\n2:12:27.880 --> 2:12:29.680\n is an integrating machine.\n\n2:12:29.680 --> 2:12:31.120\n And in computer science, I understand\n\n2:12:31.120 --> 2:12:33.720\n there's a term called garbage in, garbage out.\n\n2:12:33.720 --> 2:12:35.000\n Lying is garbage in.\n\n2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:36.000\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:38.920\n So it's not good strategy.\n\n2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:42.760\n Cheating, screwing your customers in a business,\n\n2:12:42.760 --> 2:12:45.120\n not paying your suppliers as a businessman,\n\n2:12:45.120 --> 2:12:47.080\n not good business practices,\n\n2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:49.320\n not good practices for being alive.\n\n2:12:49.320 --> 2:12:52.960\n So win, win is both model and practical.\n\n2:12:52.960 --> 2:12:55.040\n And the beauty of Heinemann's philosophy,\n\n2:12:55.040 --> 2:12:57.240\n and I think this is really important,\n\n2:12:57.240 --> 2:12:58.760\n is that the model is the practical\n\n2:12:58.760 --> 2:13:00.320\n and the practical is the model.\n\n2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:03.280\n And therefore, if you are a model, you will be happy.\n\n2:13:04.680 --> 2:13:08.040\n Yeah, that's why the application\n\n2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:11.840\n of the philosophy of objectivism is so easy to practice.\n\n2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:15.160\n So like, or to discuss, or possible to discuss.\n\n2:13:15.160 --> 2:13:16.480\n That's why you talk about all.\n\n2:13:16.480 --> 2:13:17.560\n I'm so clear cut.\n\n2:13:17.560 --> 2:13:18.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:19.400\n I'm so vigorous about my view.\n\n2:13:19.400 --> 2:13:20.920\n And that's fundamentally practical.\n\n2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:24.440\n I mean, that's the best of philosophies is practical.\n\n2:13:24.440 --> 2:13:27.680\n It's in a sense, teaching you how to live a good life.\n\n2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:30.160\n And it's teaching you how to live a good life,\n\n2:13:30.160 --> 2:13:33.280\n not just as you, but as a human being.\n\n2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:35.440\n And therefore, the principles that apply to you\n\n2:13:35.440 --> 2:13:37.200\n probably apply to me as well.\n\n2:13:37.200 --> 2:13:40.040\n And if we both share the same principles\n\n2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:42.760\n of how to live a good life, we're not gonna be enemies.\n\n2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:46.840\n You brought up anarchy earlier.\n\n2:13:46.840 --> 2:13:49.560\n It's an interesting question\n\n2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:52.040\n because you've kind of said politicians.\n\n2:13:52.040 --> 2:13:54.000\n I mean, part of it is a little bit joking,\n\n2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:57.320\n but politicians are not good people.\n\n2:13:57.320 --> 2:13:58.440\n Yep.\n\n2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:02.080\n So, but we should have some.\n\n2:14:02.080 --> 2:14:05.840\n So you have an opposition to anarchism.\n\n2:14:05.840 --> 2:14:08.360\n So they, first of all, they weren't always not bad people.\n\n2:14:08.360 --> 2:14:10.800\n That is, I gave examples of people\n\n2:14:10.800 --> 2:14:11.880\n who engage in political life\n\n2:14:11.880 --> 2:14:14.080\n who I think were good people basically.\n\n2:14:14.080 --> 2:14:17.160\n And, but they think they get worse over time\n\n2:14:17.160 --> 2:14:19.960\n if the system is corrupt.\n\n2:14:19.960 --> 2:14:21.920\n And I think the system, unfortunately,\n\n2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:24.560\n even the American system, as good as it was,\n\n2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:27.400\n was founded on quicksand and have corruption built in.\n\n2:14:28.560 --> 2:14:30.400\n They didn't quite get it.\n\n2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:31.920\n And they needed Ayn Rand to get it.\n\n2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:32.920\n So I'm not blaming them.\n\n2:14:32.920 --> 2:14:34.440\n I don't think they share any blame.\n\n2:14:34.440 --> 2:14:39.280\n You needed a philosophy in order to completely fulfill\n\n2:14:39.280 --> 2:14:40.800\n the promise that is America,\n\n2:14:40.800 --> 2:14:42.280\n or the promise that is the founding of America.\n\n2:14:42.280 --> 2:14:45.320\n So the place where corruption sneaked in\n\n2:14:45.320 --> 2:14:48.400\n is the lack in some way of the philosophy\n\n2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:49.600\n underlying the nation?\n\n2:14:49.600 --> 2:14:50.440\n Absolutely.\n\n2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:53.080\n So it's Christianity.\n\n2:14:53.080 --> 2:14:57.120\n It's, you know, not to hit on another controversial topic.\n\n2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:01.800\n It's religion, which undercut their morality.\n\n2:15:01.800 --> 2:15:05.880\n So the founders were explicitly Christian\n\n2:15:05.880 --> 2:15:08.240\n and altruistic in their morality.\n\n2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:11.800\n Implicitly, in terms of their actions,\n\n2:15:11.800 --> 2:15:12.880\n they were completely secular,\n\n2:15:12.880 --> 2:15:15.240\n and they were very secular anyway.\n\n2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:17.680\n But in their morality, even, they were secular.\n\n2:15:17.680 --> 2:15:20.000\n So there's nothing in Christianity that says\n\n2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:23.200\n that you have an inalienable right to pursue happiness.\n\n2:15:23.200 --> 2:15:25.120\n That's unbelievably self interested\n\n2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:28.400\n and based on kind of a moral philosophy of ego,\n\n2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:30.080\n of an egoistic moral philosophy.\n\n2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:31.120\n But they didn't know that.\n\n2:15:31.120 --> 2:15:33.080\n And they didn't know how to ground it.\n\n2:15:33.080 --> 2:15:36.040\n They implicitly, they had that fast thinking, that gut.\n\n2:15:36.040 --> 2:15:37.520\n They told them that this was right.\n\n2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:39.640\n And the whole enlightenment, that period,\n\n2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:44.640\n from John Locke on to really to Hume,\n\n2:15:44.880 --> 2:15:47.280\n that period is about pursuit of happiness,\n\n2:15:47.280 --> 2:15:50.280\n using reason in pursuit of the good life, right?\n\n2:15:50.280 --> 2:15:51.480\n But they can't ground it.\n\n2:15:51.480 --> 2:15:53.240\n They don't really understand what reason is,\n\n2:15:53.240 --> 2:15:56.840\n and they don't really understand what happiness requires.\n\n2:15:56.840 --> 2:16:00.040\n And they can't detach themselves from Christianity.\n\n2:16:00.040 --> 2:16:01.400\n They're not allowed to politically.\n\n2:16:01.400 --> 2:16:02.720\n And I think conceptually,\n\n2:16:02.720 --> 2:16:05.080\n you just can't make that big break.\n\n2:16:05.080 --> 2:16:07.160\n Rand is an enlightenment thinker in that sense.\n\n2:16:07.160 --> 2:16:10.960\n She is what should have followed right after, right?\n\n2:16:10.960 --> 2:16:13.320\n She should have come there and grounded them\n\n2:16:13.320 --> 2:16:18.080\n in the secular and in the egoistic\n\n2:16:18.080 --> 2:16:19.960\n and the Aristotelian view of morality\n\n2:16:19.960 --> 2:16:24.960\n as a code of values to basically to guide your life,\n\n2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:27.240\n to guide your life towards happiness.\n\n2:16:27.240 --> 2:16:28.800\n That's Aristotle's view, right?\n\n2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:34.000\n So they didn't have that.\n\n2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:38.400\n So I think that government is necessary.\n\n2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:39.520\n It's not a necessary evil.\n\n2:16:39.520 --> 2:16:42.880\n It's a necessary good, because it does something good.\n\n2:16:43.840 --> 2:16:45.800\n And the good that it does\n\n2:16:45.800 --> 2:16:48.000\n is it eliminates coercion from society.\n\n2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:50.000\n It eliminates violence from society.\n\n2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:52.680\n It eliminates the use of force\n\n2:16:52.680 --> 2:16:55.360\n between individuals from society.\n\n2:16:55.360 --> 2:16:56.840\n And that...\n\n2:16:56.840 --> 2:16:59.360\n But see, the argument like Michael Malice would make,\n\n2:16:59.360 --> 2:17:02.440\n give me a chance here,\n\n2:17:02.440 --> 2:17:05.960\n is why can't you apply the same kind of reasoning\n\n2:17:05.960 --> 2:17:08.760\n that you've effectively used for the rest\n\n2:17:08.760 --> 2:17:12.160\n of mutually agreed upon institutions\n\n2:17:12.160 --> 2:17:14.040\n that are driven by capitalism,\n\n2:17:14.040 --> 2:17:17.240\n that we can't also hire forces\n\n2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:19.240\n to protect us from the violence,\n\n2:17:19.240 --> 2:17:21.560\n to ensure the stability of society\n\n2:17:21.560 --> 2:17:23.280\n that protects us from the violence.\n\n2:17:24.920 --> 2:17:28.440\n Why draw the line at this particular place, right?\n\n2:17:28.440 --> 2:17:30.840\n Well, because there is no other place to draw a line,\n\n2:17:30.840 --> 2:17:32.600\n and there is a line.\n\n2:17:32.600 --> 2:17:35.160\n And by the way, we draw lines at other places, right?\n\n2:17:36.280 --> 2:17:40.560\n We don't vote.\n\n2:17:45.240 --> 2:17:48.040\n We don't determine truth and science based on competition.\n\n2:17:49.200 --> 2:17:51.520\n Right, so that's a line.\n\n2:17:51.520 --> 2:17:53.680\n But first of all, some people might say...\n\n2:17:53.680 --> 2:17:55.360\n I mean, there's competition in a sense\n\n2:17:55.360 --> 2:17:57.360\n that you have alternate theories,\n\n2:17:57.360 --> 2:17:59.080\n but at the end of the day,\n\n2:17:59.080 --> 2:18:01.720\n whether you decide that he's right or he's right\n\n2:18:01.720 --> 2:18:04.680\n is not based on the market.\n\n2:18:04.680 --> 2:18:09.400\n It's based on facts, on reality, on objective reality.\n\n2:18:09.400 --> 2:18:11.440\n You have to...\n\n2:18:11.440 --> 2:18:14.280\n And some people will never accept that this person is right\n\n2:18:14.280 --> 2:18:17.000\n because they don't see the string.\n\n2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:19.160\n So first of all, what they reject,\n\n2:18:19.160 --> 2:18:20.480\n what most anarchists reject,\n\n2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:23.600\n even if they don't admit it or recognize it,\n\n2:18:23.600 --> 2:18:26.640\n is they reject objective reality.\n\n2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:27.920\n In which sense?\n\n2:18:27.920 --> 2:18:29.480\n So like, okay, I get it, right.\n\n2:18:29.480 --> 2:18:30.960\n So there's a whole...\n\n2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:34.240\n So the whole realm of law\n\n2:18:36.600 --> 2:18:38.760\n is a scientific realm\n\n2:18:39.880 --> 2:18:43.880\n to define, for example, the boundaries of private property.\n\n2:18:45.400 --> 2:18:47.480\n It's not an issue of competition.\n\n2:18:47.480 --> 2:18:50.480\n It's not an issue of,\n\n2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:53.760\n I have one system and you have another system.\n\n2:18:53.760 --> 2:18:55.800\n It's an issue of a big competition.\n\n2:18:55.800 --> 2:18:57.880\n It's an issue of objective reality.\n\n2:18:57.880 --> 2:19:00.840\n And now it's more difficult than science in a sense\n\n2:19:00.840 --> 2:19:03.600\n because it's more difficult to prove\n\n2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:05.520\n that my conception of property is correct\n\n2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:07.680\n and you're correct.\n\n2:19:07.680 --> 2:19:10.200\n But there is a correct one.\n\n2:19:10.200 --> 2:19:12.280\n In reality, there's a correct vision.\n\n2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:13.280\n It's more abstract.\n\n2:19:14.480 --> 2:19:15.320\n But look,\n\n2:19:16.560 --> 2:19:19.920\n somebody has to decide what property is.\n\n2:19:19.920 --> 2:19:24.920\n So my property is defined by certain boundaries.\n\n2:19:24.920 --> 2:19:27.160\n And I have a police force\n\n2:19:27.160 --> 2:19:30.040\n and I have a judiciary system that backs my vision.\n\n2:19:31.040 --> 2:19:33.040\n And you have a claim against my property.\n\n2:19:33.960 --> 2:19:35.120\n You have a claim against my property.\n\n2:19:35.120 --> 2:19:38.240\n And you have a police force and a judicial system\n\n2:19:38.240 --> 2:19:39.360\n that backs your claim.\n\n2:19:40.720 --> 2:19:41.800\n Who's right?\n\n2:19:41.800 --> 2:19:45.160\n So our definitions of property are different?\n\n2:19:45.160 --> 2:19:46.400\n Yes, our definitions of property\n\n2:19:46.400 --> 2:19:48.960\n or our claim on the property is different.\n\n2:19:48.960 --> 2:19:54.200\n So what if we just agree on the definition of property and...\n\n2:19:54.200 --> 2:19:55.760\n But why should we agree, right?\n\n2:19:55.760 --> 2:19:58.720\n Your judicial system is one definition of property.\n\n2:19:58.720 --> 2:20:00.320\n My judicial system is not.\n\n2:20:00.320 --> 2:20:02.920\n You think that there's no such thing\n\n2:20:02.920 --> 2:20:05.240\n as intellectual property rights.\n\n2:20:05.240 --> 2:20:07.360\n And your whole system believes that.\n\n2:20:07.360 --> 2:20:09.600\n And my whole system believes there is such thing.\n\n2:20:09.600 --> 2:20:12.160\n So you are duplicating my books\n\n2:20:12.160 --> 2:20:14.280\n and handing them out to all your friends\n\n2:20:14.280 --> 2:20:16.000\n and not paying me a royalty.\n\n2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:16.840\n Yeah.\n\n2:20:16.840 --> 2:20:19.640\n And I think that's wrong.\n\n2:20:19.640 --> 2:20:23.960\n My judicial system and my police force think that's wrong.\n\n2:20:23.960 --> 2:20:27.880\n And we're both living in the same geographic area, right?\n\n2:20:27.880 --> 2:20:31.560\n So we have overlapping jurisdictions.\n\n2:20:31.560 --> 2:20:34.600\n Now, the anarchist would say, well, we'll negotiate.\n\n2:20:34.600 --> 2:20:35.760\n Why should we negotiate?\n\n2:20:35.760 --> 2:20:37.440\n My system is actually right.\n\n2:20:37.440 --> 2:20:39.280\n There is such a thing as intellectual property rights.\n\n2:20:39.280 --> 2:20:40.560\n There's no negotiation here.\n\n2:20:40.560 --> 2:20:41.560\n You're wrong.\n\n2:20:41.560 --> 2:20:44.280\n And you should either pay a fine or go to jail.\n\n2:20:44.280 --> 2:20:45.520\n Yeah, but why can't...\n\n2:20:45.520 --> 2:20:48.480\n Because it's a community, there's multiple parties\n\n2:20:48.480 --> 2:20:49.920\n and it's like a majority vote.\n\n2:20:49.920 --> 2:20:52.640\n They'll hire different forces that says,\n\n2:20:52.640 --> 2:20:54.760\n yeah, Yaron is onto something here\n\n2:20:54.760 --> 2:20:57.080\n with the definition of property and we'll go with that.\n\n2:20:57.080 --> 2:21:01.320\n So are anarchists pro democracy in the majority rule sense?\n\n2:21:01.320 --> 2:21:02.160\n Well, I think so.\n\n2:21:02.160 --> 2:21:07.160\n I think anarchy promotes like emergent democracy, right?\n\n2:21:07.680 --> 2:21:08.520\n Like the...\n\n2:21:08.520 --> 2:21:09.960\n No, it doesn't.\n\n2:21:09.960 --> 2:21:11.240\n I'll tell you what it promotes.\n\n2:21:11.240 --> 2:21:15.960\n It promotes emergent strife and civil war and violence,\n\n2:21:15.960 --> 2:21:18.240\n constant uninterrupted violence.\n\n2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:20.880\n Because the only way to settle the dispute between us,\n\n2:21:20.880 --> 2:21:23.240\n since we both think that we are right\n\n2:21:23.240 --> 2:21:26.920\n and we have guns behind us to protect that\n\n2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:28.080\n and we have a legal system,\n\n2:21:28.080 --> 2:21:30.160\n we have a whole theory of ideas,\n\n2:21:30.160 --> 2:21:33.720\n is you're stealing my stuff.\n\n2:21:33.720 --> 2:21:35.560\n How do I get it back?\n\n2:21:35.560 --> 2:21:37.440\n I invade you, right?\n\n2:21:37.440 --> 2:21:41.880\n I take over, and who's gonna win that battle?\n\n2:21:41.880 --> 2:21:43.000\n The smartest guy?\n\n2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:44.440\n Oh, the guy with the biggest guns.\n\n2:21:44.440 --> 2:21:46.360\n See, but the anarchists would say\n\n2:21:46.360 --> 2:21:48.280\n that they're using implied,\n\n2:21:48.280 --> 2:21:51.680\n like the state uses implied force.\n\n2:21:51.680 --> 2:21:53.000\n They're already doing violence.\n\n2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:56.040\n Because they take the state as it is today\n\n2:21:56.040 --> 2:21:58.760\n and they refuse to engage in the conversation\n\n2:21:58.760 --> 2:22:01.200\n about what a state should and could look like\n\n2:22:01.200 --> 2:22:04.080\n and how we can create mechanisms\n\n2:22:04.080 --> 2:22:07.000\n to protect us from the state using those.\n\n2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:10.320\n But look, my view of anarchy is very simple.\n\n2:22:10.320 --> 2:22:12.440\n It's a ridiculous position.\n\n2:22:12.440 --> 2:22:13.560\n It's infantile.\n\n2:22:13.560 --> 2:22:14.960\n I mean, I really mean this, right?\n\n2:22:14.960 --> 2:22:16.480\n And sorry to Michael,\n\n2:22:16.480 --> 2:22:19.320\n but and all the other very, very smart,\n\n2:22:19.320 --> 2:22:20.760\n very, very smart anarchists.\n\n2:22:20.760 --> 2:22:22.280\n Because anarchists is never,\n\n2:22:23.320 --> 2:22:25.680\n you won't find a dumb anarchist.\n\n2:22:25.680 --> 2:22:26.520\n Right.\n\n2:22:26.520 --> 2:22:28.800\n Because dumb people know it wouldn't work.\n\n2:22:28.800 --> 2:22:31.680\n You have to have, it's absolutely true.\n\n2:22:31.680 --> 2:22:35.800\n You have to have a certain IQ to be an anarchist.\n\n2:22:35.800 --> 2:22:37.400\n That's true, they're all really intelligent.\n\n2:22:37.400 --> 2:22:38.240\n All intelligence.\n\n2:22:38.240 --> 2:22:42.640\n And the reason is that you have to create\n\n2:22:42.640 --> 2:22:45.840\n such a mythology in your head.\n\n2:22:45.840 --> 2:22:49.440\n You have to create so many rationalizations.\n\n2:22:49.440 --> 2:22:52.640\n Any Joe in the street knows it doesn't work\n\n2:22:52.640 --> 2:22:55.560\n because they can understand what happens\n\n2:22:55.560 --> 2:22:59.240\n when two people who are armed are in the street\n\n2:22:59.240 --> 2:23:01.960\n and have a dispute and there's no mechanism\n\n2:23:01.960 --> 2:23:03.680\n to resolve that dispute.\n\n2:23:03.680 --> 2:23:04.640\n Yeah.\n\n2:23:04.640 --> 2:23:06.320\n That's objective.\n\n2:23:06.320 --> 2:23:07.840\n And this is where it gets subjective.\n\n2:23:07.840 --> 2:23:09.440\n That's objective.\n\n2:23:09.440 --> 2:23:11.280\n The whole point of government is\n\n2:23:12.200 --> 2:23:14.800\n that it is the objective authority\n\n2:23:14.800 --> 2:23:18.840\n for determining the truth in one regard,\n\n2:23:18.840 --> 2:23:20.320\n in regard to force.\n\n2:23:21.560 --> 2:23:25.600\n Because the only alternative to determining it\n\n2:23:25.600 --> 2:23:27.920\n when it comes to force is through force.\n\n2:23:27.920 --> 2:23:31.120\n The only way to resolve disputes is through force\n\n2:23:31.120 --> 2:23:33.160\n or through this negotiation, which is unjust\n\n2:23:33.160 --> 2:23:34.760\n because if one party is right and one party is wrong,\n\n2:23:34.760 --> 2:23:35.880\n why negotiate?\n\n2:23:35.880 --> 2:23:38.600\n And this is the point.\n\n2:23:38.600 --> 2:23:41.760\n I'm not against competition of governance.\n\n2:23:41.760 --> 2:23:43.720\n I'm all for competition of governance.\n\n2:23:43.720 --> 2:23:44.680\n We do that all the time.\n\n2:23:44.680 --> 2:23:46.200\n It's called countries.\n\n2:23:46.200 --> 2:23:49.120\n The United States has a certain governance structure.\n\n2:23:49.120 --> 2:23:50.800\n The Soviet Union had a governance structure.\n\n2:23:50.800 --> 2:23:52.760\n Mexico has a governance structure.\n\n2:23:52.760 --> 2:23:54.160\n And they're competing.\n\n2:23:54.160 --> 2:23:55.880\n And we can observe the competition.\n\n2:23:55.880 --> 2:23:58.640\n And in my world, you could move freely\n\n2:23:58.640 --> 2:24:00.240\n from one governance to another.\n\n2:24:00.240 --> 2:24:01.520\n If you didn't like your governance,\n\n2:24:01.520 --> 2:24:03.840\n you would move to a better governance system.\n\n2:24:03.840 --> 2:24:07.240\n But they have to have autonomy within a geographic area.\n\n2:24:07.240 --> 2:24:10.720\n Otherwise what you get is complete and utter civil war.\n\n2:24:10.720 --> 2:24:13.120\n The law needs to be objective.\n\n2:24:13.120 --> 2:24:15.360\n And there needs to be one law over a piece of ground.\n\n2:24:15.360 --> 2:24:16.800\n And if you disagree with that law,\n\n2:24:16.800 --> 2:24:18.560\n you can move somewhere else where they may.\n\n2:24:18.560 --> 2:24:21.480\n This is why federalism is such a beautiful system.\n\n2:24:21.480 --> 2:24:23.960\n Even within the United States, we have states.\n\n2:24:23.960 --> 2:24:25.760\n And on certain issues, we're allowed\n\n2:24:25.760 --> 2:24:27.960\n to disagree between states, like the death penalty.\n\n2:24:27.960 --> 2:24:30.000\n Some states do, some states don't.\n\n2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:30.920\n Fine.\n\n2:24:30.920 --> 2:24:33.720\n And now I can move from one state if I don't like it.\n\n2:24:33.720 --> 2:24:36.040\n But there's certain issues you cannot have disagreement.\n\n2:24:36.040 --> 2:24:39.080\n Slavery, for example, this is why we had a civil war.\n\n2:24:39.080 --> 2:24:43.600\n But let me, one other argument against anarchy.\n\n2:24:43.600 --> 2:24:47.960\n Markets exist where force has been eliminated.\n\n2:24:49.080 --> 2:24:50.000\n Sorry, can you say that again?\n\n2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:54.360\n Markets exist where the rule of force has been eliminated.\n\n2:24:55.680 --> 2:24:57.080\n The rule of force?\n\n2:24:57.080 --> 2:24:58.120\n Yes.\n\n2:24:58.120 --> 2:25:02.680\n So a market will exist if we know\n\n2:25:02.680 --> 2:25:05.680\n that you can't pull a gun on me and just take my stuff.\n\n2:25:05.680 --> 2:25:08.080\n I am willing to engage in transaction with you\n\n2:25:08.080 --> 2:25:10.840\n if we have an implicit understanding\n\n2:25:10.840 --> 2:25:13.240\n that we're not gonna use force against each other.\n\n2:25:13.240 --> 2:25:15.600\n So force has something special to it.\n\n2:25:15.600 --> 2:25:16.440\n Yes.\n\n2:25:16.440 --> 2:25:18.800\n It's a special, it overrides,\n\n2:25:18.800 --> 2:25:21.800\n because we are still agreeing we can manipulate each other.\n\n2:25:21.800 --> 2:25:22.840\n Yes.\n\n2:25:22.840 --> 2:25:23.680\n But force we can't.\n\n2:25:23.680 --> 2:25:25.240\n Force kind of,\n\n2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:28.320\n so there's something fundamental about violence.\n\n2:25:28.320 --> 2:25:30.640\n Force is a fundamental force.\n\n2:25:30.640 --> 2:25:32.480\n It's the anti reason.\n\n2:25:32.480 --> 2:25:34.480\n It's the anti life.\n\n2:25:34.480 --> 2:25:38.680\n It's the anti force against another person.\n\n2:25:38.680 --> 2:25:41.600\n And it's what it does is shuts down the mind.\n\n2:25:41.600 --> 2:25:43.040\n Right.\n\n2:25:43.040 --> 2:25:45.920\n So in order to have a market,\n\n2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:48.320\n you have to extract force.\n\n2:25:49.280 --> 2:25:50.120\n That's fascinating.\n\n2:25:50.120 --> 2:25:51.480\n How can you have a market in force?\n\n2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:56.480\n When I, there's an Instagram channel called nature's metal\n\n2:25:56.480 --> 2:26:00.960\n where it has all these videos of animals,\n\n2:26:00.960 --> 2:26:03.160\n basically having a market of force.\n\n2:26:03.160 --> 2:26:04.000\n Yes.\n\n2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:06.040\n But that shuts down the ability to reason\n\n2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:08.000\n and animals don't need to because they can't.\n\n2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:08.840\n Exactly.\n\n2:26:08.840 --> 2:26:10.960\n So the innovation that is human beings\n\n2:26:10.960 --> 2:26:12.440\n is our capacity to reason.\n\n2:26:12.440 --> 2:26:16.000\n And therefore the relegation of force to the animals.\n\n2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:17.440\n We don't do force.\n\n2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:20.200\n Civilization is what we don't have force.\n\n2:26:20.200 --> 2:26:25.200\n And so what you have is you cannot have a market in that,\n\n2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:28.960\n which a market requires the elimination of it.\n\n2:26:28.960 --> 2:26:32.240\n And I don't debate formally these guys,\n\n2:26:32.240 --> 2:26:34.240\n but I interact with them all the time, right?\n\n2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:37.120\n And you get these absurd arguments where,\n\n2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:39.840\n David Friedman will say, that's Milton Friedman's son.\n\n2:26:39.840 --> 2:26:42.760\n He will say something like, well, in Somalia,\n\n2:26:42.760 --> 2:26:43.960\n in the Northern part of Somalia\n\n2:26:43.960 --> 2:26:45.360\n where they have no government,\n\n2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:46.560\n you have all these wonderful,\n\n2:26:46.560 --> 2:26:51.200\n you have these tribal tribunals of these tribes\n\n2:26:51.200 --> 2:26:52.920\n and they resolve disputes.\n\n2:26:52.920 --> 2:26:54.040\n Yeah.\n\n2:26:54.040 --> 2:26:57.080\n Barbarically, they use Sharia law.\n\n2:26:57.080 --> 2:26:58.760\n They have no respect for individual rights,\n\n2:26:58.760 --> 2:27:00.320\n no respect for property.\n\n2:27:00.320 --> 2:27:02.520\n And the only reason they have any authority\n\n2:27:02.520 --> 2:27:04.880\n is because they have guns and they have power\n\n2:27:04.880 --> 2:27:08.600\n and they have force and they do it barbarically.\n\n2:27:08.600 --> 2:27:13.600\n There's nothing civilizing about the courts of Somalian\n\n2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:18.120\n and they write about pirates because they view force.\n\n2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:20.360\n They don't view force as something unique\n\n2:27:20.360 --> 2:27:23.200\n that must be extracted from human life.\n\n2:27:23.200 --> 2:27:26.160\n And that's why anarchy has to devolve into violence\n\n2:27:26.160 --> 2:27:27.640\n because it treats forces just,\n\n2:27:27.640 --> 2:27:32.360\n what's the big deal with negotiating over guns?\n\n2:27:32.360 --> 2:27:34.600\n So we covered a lot of high level philosophy,\n\n2:27:34.600 --> 2:27:39.600\n but I'd like to touch on the troubles, the chaos of the day.\n\n2:27:41.400 --> 2:27:42.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:43.800\n A couple of things.\n\n2:27:43.800 --> 2:27:48.800\n And I really trying to find a hopeful path way out.\n\n2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:55.080\n So one is the current coronavirus pandemic,\n\n2:27:55.080 --> 2:27:57.120\n or in particular, not the virus,\n\n2:27:57.120 --> 2:28:00.480\n but our handling of it.\n\n2:28:00.480 --> 2:28:04.800\n Is there something philosophically, politically\n\n2:28:04.800 --> 2:28:06.120\n that you would like to see,\n\n2:28:06.120 --> 2:28:08.120\n that you would like to recommend,\n\n2:28:08.120 --> 2:28:11.040\n that you would like to maybe give a hopeful message\n\n2:28:11.040 --> 2:28:12.760\n if we take that kind of trajectory\n\n2:28:12.760 --> 2:28:14.280\n we might be able to get out?\n\n2:28:14.280 --> 2:28:18.200\n Because I'm kind of worried about the economic pain\n\n2:28:18.200 --> 2:28:22.000\n that people are feeling that there's this quiet suffering.\n\n2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:23.560\n I mean, I agree with you completely.\n\n2:28:23.560 --> 2:28:24.640\n There is a quiet suffering.\n\n2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:26.080\n It's horrible.\n\n2:28:26.080 --> 2:28:27.560\n I mean, I know people.\n\n2:28:27.560 --> 2:28:29.400\n I go to a lot of restaurants.\n\n2:28:29.400 --> 2:28:31.680\n One of the things we love to do is eat out.\n\n2:28:31.680 --> 2:28:33.800\n My wife doesn't like cooking anymore.\n\n2:28:33.800 --> 2:28:35.920\n We don't have kids in the house anymore,\n\n2:28:35.920 --> 2:28:36.760\n so she doesn't have to.\n\n2:28:36.760 --> 2:28:37.600\n So we go out a lot.\n\n2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:38.440\n We go to restaurants.\n\n2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:40.520\n And because we have our favorites and we go to them a lot,\n\n2:28:40.520 --> 2:28:44.760\n we get to know the owners of the restaurant, the chef.\n\n2:28:44.760 --> 2:28:46.880\n And it's just heartbreaking.\n\n2:28:46.880 --> 2:28:51.040\n These people put their life, their blood, sweat, and tears.\n\n2:28:51.040 --> 2:28:53.960\n I mean, real blood, sweat, and tears into these projects.\n\n2:28:53.960 --> 2:28:56.960\n Restaurants are super difficult to manage.\n\n2:28:56.960 --> 2:28:58.520\n Most of them go bankrupt anyway.\n\n2:28:59.520 --> 2:29:01.760\n And the restaurants, we go to a good restaurant.\n\n2:29:01.760 --> 2:29:03.040\n So they've done a good job\n\n2:29:03.040 --> 2:29:06.520\n and they offer unique value.\n\n2:29:08.200 --> 2:29:09.400\n And they shut them down.\n\n2:29:10.640 --> 2:29:12.880\n And many of them will never open.\n\n2:29:13.880 --> 2:29:16.120\n Something like the estimate 50, 60% of restaurants\n\n2:29:16.120 --> 2:29:17.600\n in some places won't open.\n\n2:29:17.600 --> 2:29:18.600\n These are people's lives.\n\n2:29:18.600 --> 2:29:19.520\n These are people's capital.\n\n2:29:19.520 --> 2:29:20.520\n These are people's effort.\n\n2:29:20.520 --> 2:29:22.000\n These are people's love.\n\n2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:22.840\n Talk about love.\n\n2:29:22.840 --> 2:29:24.280\n Love what they do.\n\n2:29:24.280 --> 2:29:26.480\n Particularly if they're the chef as well.\n\n2:29:26.480 --> 2:29:27.560\n And it's gone.\n\n2:29:27.560 --> 2:29:28.400\n And it's disappeared.\n\n2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:29.520\n And what are they gonna do with their lives now?\n\n2:29:29.520 --> 2:29:30.600\n They're gonna live off the government\n\n2:29:30.600 --> 2:29:32.520\n the way our politicians would like them.\n\n2:29:32.520 --> 2:29:34.160\n Bigger and bigger stimulus plans\n\n2:29:34.160 --> 2:29:35.720\n so we can hand checks to people\n\n2:29:35.720 --> 2:29:38.360\n to get them used to living off of us rather than.\n\n2:29:38.360 --> 2:29:40.480\n It's disgusting and it's offensive\n\n2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:42.760\n and it's unbelievably sad.\n\n2:29:42.760 --> 2:29:44.440\n And this is where it comes to this.\n\n2:29:44.440 --> 2:29:45.360\n I care about other people.\n\n2:29:45.360 --> 2:29:46.880\n I mean, this idea that objectivists don't care.\n\n2:29:46.880 --> 2:29:50.640\n I mean, I love these people who provide me with pleasure\n\n2:29:50.640 --> 2:29:54.760\n of eating wonderful food in a great environment.\n\n2:29:54.760 --> 2:29:56.680\n And there's something inspiring about them too.\n\n2:29:56.680 --> 2:29:58.480\n Like when I see a great restaurant owner,\n\n2:29:58.480 --> 2:30:00.440\n I wanna do better with my own stuff.\n\n2:30:00.440 --> 2:30:02.080\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:30:02.080 --> 2:30:02.920\n They're inspiring.\n\n2:30:02.920 --> 2:30:04.680\n Anybody who does it is excellent.\n\n2:30:04.680 --> 2:30:07.000\n I love sports because it's the one realm\n\n2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:10.800\n in which you'd still value and celebrate excellence.\n\n2:30:10.800 --> 2:30:13.280\n But I try to celebrate excellence everything in my life.\n\n2:30:13.280 --> 2:30:16.600\n So I try to be nice to these people.\n\n2:30:16.600 --> 2:30:20.200\n And with COVID, we went more to restaurants,\n\n2:30:20.200 --> 2:30:23.200\n we did more takeout stuff.\n\n2:30:23.200 --> 2:30:25.400\n We made an effort, particularly the restaurants,\n\n2:30:25.400 --> 2:30:27.360\n we really love to keep them going,\n\n2:30:27.360 --> 2:30:29.160\n to encourage them, to support them.\n\n2:30:30.040 --> 2:30:34.160\n The problem is philosophy drives the world.\n\n2:30:35.360 --> 2:30:38.640\n The response to COVID has been worse than pathetic.\n\n2:30:40.520 --> 2:30:42.120\n And it's driven by philosophy.\n\n2:30:43.080 --> 2:30:46.440\n It's driven by disrespect to science,\n\n2:30:46.440 --> 2:30:48.960\n ignorance and disrespect of statistics,\n\n2:30:48.960 --> 2:30:52.320\n a disrespect of individual human decision making.\n\n2:30:52.320 --> 2:30:55.200\n Government has to decide everything for us.\n\n2:30:55.200 --> 2:30:59.160\n And just throughout the process and a disrespect of markets\n\n2:30:59.160 --> 2:31:02.360\n because we didn't let markets work to facilitate\n\n2:31:02.360 --> 2:31:05.080\n what we needed in order to deal with this virus.\n\n2:31:05.080 --> 2:31:07.320\n If you look at the place, it's interesting\n\n2:31:07.320 --> 2:31:08.640\n that the only place on the planet\n\n2:31:08.640 --> 2:31:11.880\n that's done well with this are parts of Asia, right?\n\n2:31:11.880 --> 2:31:14.440\n Taiwan did phenomenally with this.\n\n2:31:14.440 --> 2:31:18.120\n And the vice president of Taiwan is an epidemiologist.\n\n2:31:18.120 --> 2:31:20.080\n So he knew what he was doing.\n\n2:31:20.080 --> 2:31:22.200\n And they got it right from the beginning.\n\n2:31:22.200 --> 2:31:26.240\n South Korea did amazing, even Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\n2:31:27.280 --> 2:31:29.720\n Hong Kong is just very few deaths.\n\n2:31:31.040 --> 2:31:34.480\n And the economy wasn't shut down in any of those places.\n\n2:31:34.480 --> 2:31:36.920\n There were no lockdowns in any of those places.\n\n2:31:38.600 --> 2:31:43.200\n The CDC had plans before this happened\n\n2:31:43.200 --> 2:31:45.120\n on how to deal with good plans.\n\n2:31:45.120 --> 2:31:48.440\n Indeed, if you ask people around the world before the pandemic\n\n2:31:48.440 --> 2:31:51.440\n which country is best prepared for a pandemic,\n\n2:31:51.440 --> 2:31:53.080\n they would have said the United States\n\n2:31:53.080 --> 2:31:54.760\n because of the CDC's plans\n\n2:31:54.760 --> 2:31:56.840\n and all of our emergency reserves and all that\n\n2:31:56.840 --> 2:31:57.680\n and the wealth.\n\n2:31:59.560 --> 2:32:02.040\n And yet all of that went out the window\n\n2:32:02.040 --> 2:32:06.320\n because people panicked, people didn't think,\n\n2:32:06.320 --> 2:32:09.520\n go back to reason, people were arrogant,\n\n2:32:10.560 --> 2:32:14.440\n refused to use the tools that they had at their disposal\n\n2:32:14.440 --> 2:32:15.600\n to deal with this.\n\n2:32:15.600 --> 2:32:17.560\n So you deal with pandemics, it's very simple\n\n2:32:17.560 --> 2:32:18.400\n how you deal with pandemics.\n\n2:32:18.400 --> 2:32:20.600\n And this is how South Korea and Taiwan and everywhere,\n\n2:32:20.600 --> 2:32:25.600\n you deal with them by testing, tracing and isolating.\n\n2:32:26.680 --> 2:32:28.000\n That's it.\n\n2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:30.280\n And you do it well and you do it vigorously\n\n2:32:30.280 --> 2:32:32.240\n and you do it on scale if you have to.\n\n2:32:32.240 --> 2:32:35.080\n And you scale up to do it and we have the wealth to do that.\n\n2:32:35.080 --> 2:32:40.080\n So one question I have, it's a difficult one.\n\n2:32:40.520 --> 2:32:43.200\n So I talk about love a lot\n\n2:32:43.200 --> 2:32:45.560\n and you've just talked about Donald Trump,\n\n2:32:45.560 --> 2:32:47.880\n I guarantee you though this particular segment\n\n2:32:47.880 --> 2:32:50.240\n will be full of division from the internet.\n\n2:32:51.280 --> 2:32:56.280\n But I believe that should be and can be fixed.\n\n2:32:57.040 --> 2:33:00.440\n What I'm referring to in particular is the division\n\n2:33:00.440 --> 2:33:03.360\n because we've talked about the value of reason.\n\n2:33:04.240 --> 2:33:06.120\n And what I've noticed on the internet\n\n2:33:06.120 --> 2:33:10.200\n is the division shuts down reason.\n\n2:33:10.200 --> 2:33:12.480\n So when people hear you say Trump,\n\n2:33:12.480 --> 2:33:14.600\n actually the first sentence you said about Trump,\n\n2:33:14.600 --> 2:33:17.240\n they'll hear Trump and their ears will perk up\n\n2:33:17.240 --> 2:33:19.720\n and they'll immediately start in that first sentence,\n\n2:33:19.720 --> 2:33:22.760\n they'll say, is he a Trump supporter or a Trump?\n\n2:33:22.760 --> 2:33:24.520\n They're not interested in anything else after that.\n\n2:33:24.520 --> 2:33:26.480\n And then after that, that's it.\n\n2:33:26.480 --> 2:33:29.400\n And what, how do, so my question is,\n\n2:33:30.680 --> 2:33:34.600\n you as one of the beacons of intellectualism,\n\n2:33:34.600 --> 2:33:37.560\n quite honestly, I mean, it sounds silly to say,\n\n2:33:37.560 --> 2:33:40.680\n but you are a beacon of reason.\n\n2:33:40.680 --> 2:33:44.360\n How do we bring people together long enough\n\n2:33:44.360 --> 2:33:46.080\n to where we can reason?\n\n2:33:48.360 --> 2:33:51.040\n I mean, there's no easy way out of this\n\n2:33:51.040 --> 2:33:54.560\n because the fact that people have become tribal\n\n2:33:54.560 --> 2:33:56.400\n and they have, very tribal.\n\n2:33:57.600 --> 2:34:02.600\n And the tribe, in the tribe reason doesn't matter.\n\n2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:04.640\n It's all about emotion.\n\n2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:06.400\n It's all about belonging or not belonging.\n\n2:34:06.400 --> 2:34:08.000\n And you don't wanna stand out.\n\n2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:10.160\n You don't wanna have a different opinion.\n\n2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:11.200\n You wanna belong.\n\n2:34:11.200 --> 2:34:13.400\n And it's all about belonging.\n\n2:34:13.400 --> 2:34:18.360\n It took us decades to get back to tribalism\n\n2:34:18.360 --> 2:34:20.560\n where we were hundreds of years ago.\n\n2:34:20.560 --> 2:34:23.120\n It took millennium to get out of tribalism.\n\n2:34:23.120 --> 2:34:24.280\n It took the enlightenment\n\n2:34:24.280 --> 2:34:26.160\n to get us to the point of individualism,\n\n2:34:26.160 --> 2:34:28.400\n where we think in reason, respect for reason.\n\n2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:30.160\n Before that, we were all tribal.\n\n2:34:30.160 --> 2:34:31.960\n So it took the enlightenment to get us out of it.\n\n2:34:31.960 --> 2:34:34.480\n We've been in the enlightenment for about 250 years,\n\n2:34:34.480 --> 2:34:38.040\n influenced by the enlightenment and it's fading.\n\n2:34:38.040 --> 2:34:39.920\n The impact is fading.\n\n2:34:39.920 --> 2:34:42.280\n So what would we need to get out of it?\n\n2:34:42.280 --> 2:34:43.360\n We need self esteem.\n\n2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:46.800\n People join a tribe\n\n2:34:46.800 --> 2:34:49.000\n because they don't trust their own mind.\n\n2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:51.840\n People join a tribe\n\n2:34:51.840 --> 2:34:54.160\n because they're afraid to stand on their own two feet.\n\n2:34:54.160 --> 2:34:55.920\n They're afraid to think for themselves.\n\n2:34:55.920 --> 2:34:57.160\n They're afraid to be different.\n\n2:34:57.160 --> 2:34:58.360\n They're afraid to be unique.\n\n2:34:58.360 --> 2:35:00.840\n They're afraid to be an individual.\n\n2:35:00.840 --> 2:35:02.440\n People need self esteem.\n\n2:35:02.440 --> 2:35:04.600\n To gain self esteem,\n\n2:35:04.600 --> 2:35:08.840\n they have to have respect for rationality.\n\n2:35:08.840 --> 2:35:10.800\n They have to think and they have to achieve\n\n2:35:10.800 --> 2:35:13.000\n and they have to recognize that achievement.\n\n2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:19.760\n To do that, they have to have respect for thinking.\n\n2:35:19.760 --> 2:35:22.160\n They have to have to respect for reason.\n\n2:35:22.160 --> 2:35:24.800\n And we have to, and think about the schools.\n\n2:35:24.800 --> 2:35:27.640\n We have to have schools that teach people to think,\n\n2:35:27.640 --> 2:35:29.920\n teach people to value their mind.\n\n2:35:29.920 --> 2:35:32.680\n We have schools that teach people to feel\n\n2:35:32.680 --> 2:35:33.800\n and value their feelings.\n\n2:35:33.800 --> 2:35:36.280\n We have groups of six year olds sitting around a circle\n\n2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:37.640\n discussing politics.\n\n2:35:37.640 --> 2:35:38.480\n What?\n\n2:35:38.480 --> 2:35:39.680\n They don't know anything.\n\n2:35:39.680 --> 2:35:41.000\n They're ignorant.\n\n2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:43.280\n See, you don't know anything when you're ignorant.\n\n2:35:43.280 --> 2:35:44.560\n Yes, you can feel,\n\n2:35:44.560 --> 2:35:49.160\n but your feelings are useless as decision making tools.\n\n2:35:49.160 --> 2:35:51.360\n But we emphasize emotion.\n\n2:35:51.360 --> 2:35:53.720\n It's all about socialization and emotion.\n\n2:35:53.720 --> 2:35:57.520\n This is why they talk about this generation of snowflakes.\n\n2:35:57.520 --> 2:36:00.560\n They can't hear anything that they're opposed to\n\n2:36:00.560 --> 2:36:03.440\n because they've not learned how to use their mind,\n\n2:36:03.440 --> 2:36:04.320\n how to think.\n\n2:36:04.320 --> 2:36:08.320\n So it boils down to teaching people how to think two things,\n\n2:36:08.320 --> 2:36:11.400\n how to think and how to care about themselves.\n\n2:36:11.400 --> 2:36:14.440\n So it's thinking of self esteem and the connected,\n\n2:36:14.440 --> 2:36:16.840\n because when you think, you achieve,\n\n2:36:16.840 --> 2:36:19.000\n which gains you self esteem.\n\n2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:20.320\n When you have self esteem,\n\n2:36:20.320 --> 2:36:22.000\n it's easier to think for yourself.\n\n2:36:23.560 --> 2:36:26.240\n And I don't know how you do that quickly.\n\n2:36:26.240 --> 2:36:29.560\n I mean, I think leadership matters.\n\n2:36:29.560 --> 2:36:32.160\n So, you know, part of what I try to do\n\n2:36:32.160 --> 2:36:35.240\n is try to encourage people to do those things.\n\n2:36:35.240 --> 2:36:37.000\n But I am a small voice.\n\n2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:38.240\n You asked me when,\n\n2:36:38.240 --> 2:36:39.400\n early on you said we should talk about\n\n2:36:39.400 --> 2:36:41.080\n why I'm not more famous.\n\n2:36:41.080 --> 2:36:42.160\n I'm not famous.\n\n2:36:42.160 --> 2:36:43.480\n You know, my following is not big.\n\n2:36:43.480 --> 2:36:47.040\n It's very small in the scope of things.\n\n2:36:47.040 --> 2:36:49.840\n Well, yours and objectivism and that question,\n\n2:36:49.840 --> 2:36:51.960\n could you linger on it for a moment?\n\n2:36:51.960 --> 2:36:56.320\n Why isn't objectivism more famous?\n\n2:36:56.320 --> 2:36:59.000\n I think because it's so challenging.\n\n2:36:59.000 --> 2:37:01.080\n It's not challenging.\n\n2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:03.160\n It's not challenging to me, right?\n\n2:37:03.160 --> 2:37:06.040\n When I first encountered objectivism,\n\n2:37:06.040 --> 2:37:08.000\n it's like after the first shock\n\n2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:10.200\n and after the first kind of,\n\n2:37:10.200 --> 2:37:11.240\n none of this can be true.\n\n2:37:11.240 --> 2:37:12.880\n This is all BS.\n\n2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:16.000\n And fighting it, once I got it,\n\n2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:17.840\n it was easy.\n\n2:37:17.840 --> 2:37:19.240\n It required years of studying,\n\n2:37:19.240 --> 2:37:20.480\n but it was easy in the sense of,\n\n2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:21.600\n yes, this makes sense.\n\n2:37:22.760 --> 2:37:25.920\n But it's challenging because it upends everything.\n\n2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:28.880\n It really says what my mother taught me is wrong.\n\n2:37:28.880 --> 2:37:32.760\n And what my politicians say left and right is wrong.\n\n2:37:32.760 --> 2:37:33.720\n All of them.\n\n2:37:33.720 --> 2:37:35.480\n There's not a single politician\n\n2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:39.280\n on which I agree with on almost anything, right?\n\n2:37:39.280 --> 2:37:41.280\n Because on the fundamentals we disagree.\n\n2:37:42.200 --> 2:37:45.360\n And what my teachers are telling me is wrong.\n\n2:37:45.360 --> 2:37:48.400\n And what Jesus said is wrong.\n\n2:37:48.400 --> 2:37:50.560\n And it's hard.\n\n2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:52.040\n But the thing is,\n\n2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:54.640\n so you talk about politics and all that kind of stuff,\n\n2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:56.320\n but you know, most people don't care.\n\n2:37:56.320 --> 2:37:58.800\n The more powerful thing about objectivism\n\n2:37:58.800 --> 2:38:02.240\n is the practical of my life,\n\n2:38:02.240 --> 2:38:04.920\n of how I revolutionized my life.\n\n2:38:04.920 --> 2:38:09.920\n And that feels to be like a very important and appealing,\n\n2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:12.200\n you know, get your shit together.\n\n2:38:12.200 --> 2:38:14.600\n Yeah, but this is why Jordan Peterson\n\n2:38:14.600 --> 2:38:16.360\n is so much more successful than we are, right?\n\n2:38:16.360 --> 2:38:17.440\n Why is that?\n\n2:38:17.440 --> 2:38:18.800\n Make your bed or whatever.\n\n2:38:18.800 --> 2:38:19.640\n What's that?\n\n2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:20.480\n Make your bed.\n\n2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:23.080\n Yeah, because his personal responsibility is shallow.\n\n2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:25.760\n It's make your bed, stand up straight.\n\n2:38:25.760 --> 2:38:27.440\n That's what my mother told me when I was growing up.\n\n2:38:27.440 --> 2:38:29.600\n There's nothing new about Jordan Peterson.\n\n2:38:29.600 --> 2:38:32.160\n He says, embrace Christianity.\n\n2:38:32.160 --> 2:38:34.040\n Christianity is fine, right?\n\n2:38:34.040 --> 2:38:36.000\n Religion is okay.\n\n2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:38.080\n Just do these few things and you'll be fine.\n\n2:38:38.080 --> 2:38:42.360\n And by the way, he says, happiness, you know,\n\n2:38:42.360 --> 2:38:43.640\n you either have it or you don't.\n\n2:38:43.640 --> 2:38:44.720\n You know, it's random.\n\n2:38:44.720 --> 2:38:45.560\n You don't actually,\n\n2:38:45.560 --> 2:38:47.200\n you can't bring about your own happiness.\n\n2:38:47.200 --> 2:38:49.160\n So he's given people an easy out.\n\n2:38:49.160 --> 2:38:50.200\n People want easy outs.\n\n2:38:50.200 --> 2:38:52.560\n People buy self help books\n\n2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:53.920\n that give them five principles\n\n2:38:53.920 --> 2:38:56.200\n or living in, you know, shallow.\n\n2:38:56.200 --> 2:38:58.920\n I'm telling them, think,\n\n2:38:58.920 --> 2:39:02.560\n stand on your own two feet, be independent.\n\n2:39:02.560 --> 2:39:04.920\n Don't listen to your mother.\n\n2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:07.560\n Do your own thing, but thoughtfully,\n\n2:39:07.560 --> 2:39:09.400\n not based on emotions.\n\n2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:10.760\n So you're responsible not just\n\n2:39:10.760 --> 2:39:14.800\n for a set of particular habits and so on.\n\n2:39:14.800 --> 2:39:17.160\n You're responsible for everything.\n\n2:39:17.160 --> 2:39:18.480\n Yes, and you're responsible.\n\n2:39:18.480 --> 2:39:20.040\n Here's the big one, right?\n\n2:39:20.040 --> 2:39:24.440\n You're responsible for shaping your own soul.\n\n2:39:26.160 --> 2:39:27.920\n Your consciousness,\n\n2:39:27.920 --> 2:39:30.960\n you get to decide what it's going to be like.\n\n2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:33.440\n And the only tool you have is your mind.\n\n2:39:33.440 --> 2:39:35.600\n Your only tool is your mind.\n\n2:39:35.600 --> 2:39:37.120\n Well, your emotions play a tool\n\n2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:38.520\n when they're properly cultivated.\n\n2:39:38.520 --> 2:39:40.320\n They play a role in that.\n\n2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:43.080\n And the tools you have is thinking, experiencing,\n\n2:39:43.080 --> 2:39:46.080\n living, coming to the right conclusions,\n\n2:39:46.080 --> 2:39:47.720\n you know, listening to great music\n\n2:39:47.720 --> 2:39:51.800\n and watching good movies and art is very important\n\n2:39:51.800 --> 2:39:55.240\n in shaping your own soul and helping you do this.\n\n2:39:55.240 --> 2:39:58.400\n It's got a crucial role in that.\n\n2:39:58.400 --> 2:40:00.720\n But it's work.\n\n2:40:00.720 --> 2:40:03.520\n And it's lonely work\n\n2:40:03.520 --> 2:40:04.880\n because it's work you do with yourself.\n\n2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:06.960\n Now, if you find somebody who you love\n\n2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:09.200\n who shares these values and you can do with them,\n\n2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:11.960\n that's great, but it's mostly lonely work.\n\n2:40:11.960 --> 2:40:15.680\n It's hard, it's challenging, it ends your world.\n\n2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:17.880\n The reward is unbelievable.\n\n2:40:17.880 --> 2:40:22.880\n But even at that, think about the enlightenment, right?\n\n2:40:23.280 --> 2:40:25.920\n So up until the enlightenment, where was truth?\n\n2:40:25.920 --> 2:40:27.920\n Truth came from a book.\n\n2:40:27.920 --> 2:40:29.840\n And there were a few people who understood the book.\n\n2:40:29.840 --> 2:40:32.520\n Most of us couldn't read and they conveyed it to us.\n\n2:40:32.520 --> 2:40:33.760\n And they just told us what to do.\n\n2:40:33.760 --> 2:40:35.200\n And in that sense, life's easy.\n\n2:40:35.200 --> 2:40:38.400\n It sucks and we die young and we have nothing\n\n2:40:38.400 --> 2:40:41.600\n and we don't enjoy it, but it's easy.\n\n2:40:41.600 --> 2:40:44.400\n And the enlightenment comes around and says,\n\n2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:49.120\n we've got this tool, it's called reason.\n\n2:40:49.120 --> 2:40:51.560\n And it allows us to discover truth about the world.\n\n2:40:51.560 --> 2:40:52.920\n It's not in a book.\n\n2:40:52.920 --> 2:40:54.840\n It's actually your reason allows you\n\n2:40:54.840 --> 2:40:56.440\n to discover stuff about the world.\n\n2:40:56.440 --> 2:40:57.760\n And I consider the first,\n\n2:40:57.760 --> 2:41:01.320\n really the first figure of the enlightenment is Newton,\n\n2:41:01.320 --> 2:41:02.440\n not Locke, right?\n\n2:41:02.440 --> 2:41:03.480\n It's a scientist.\n\n2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:07.920\n Because he teaches us the laws of mechanics,\n\n2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:10.040\n like how does stuff work?\n\n2:41:10.040 --> 2:41:13.200\n And people go, oh, wow, this is cool.\n\n2:41:13.200 --> 2:41:14.560\n I can use my mind.\n\n2:41:14.560 --> 2:41:16.160\n I can discover truth.\n\n2:41:16.160 --> 2:41:18.040\n Isn't that amazing?\n\n2:41:18.040 --> 2:41:19.840\n And everything opens up once you do that.\n\n2:41:19.840 --> 2:41:21.800\n Hey, if I can discover,\n\n2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:23.880\n if I understand the laws of motion,\n\n2:41:23.880 --> 2:41:25.560\n if I can understand truth in the world,\n\n2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:27.560\n how come I can't decide who I marry?\n\n2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:29.880\n I mean, everything was fixed in those days.\n\n2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:33.040\n How come I can't decide what profession I should be in?\n\n2:41:33.040 --> 2:41:35.120\n Right, everybody would belong to a guild.\n\n2:41:35.120 --> 2:41:38.440\n How come I can't decide who my political leader should be?\n\n2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:40.520\n That's, so it's all reason.\n\n2:41:40.520 --> 2:41:43.200\n It's all, once you understand the efficacy of your own mind\n\n2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:45.160\n to understand truth, to understand reality,\n\n2:41:45.160 --> 2:41:48.160\n discover truth, not understand truth, discover it.\n\n2:41:48.160 --> 2:41:49.240\n Everything opens up.\n\n2:41:49.240 --> 2:41:51.240\n Now you can take responsibility for your own life\n\n2:41:51.240 --> 2:41:53.880\n because now you have the tool to do it.\n\n2:41:53.880 --> 2:41:57.160\n But we are living in an era where postmodernism tells us\n\n2:41:57.160 --> 2:41:59.080\n there is no truth, there is no reality,\n\n2:41:59.080 --> 2:42:00.800\n and our mind is useless anyway.\n\n2:42:01.680 --> 2:42:03.640\n Critical race theory tells us\n\n2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:05.400\n that you're determined by your race\n\n2:42:05.400 --> 2:42:06.920\n and your race shapes everything\n\n2:42:06.920 --> 2:42:08.560\n and your free will is meaningless\n\n2:42:08.560 --> 2:42:10.200\n and your reason doesn't matter\n\n2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:12.720\n because reason is just shaped by your genes\n\n2:42:12.720 --> 2:42:15.000\n and shaped by the color of your skin.\n\n2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:17.120\n It's the most racist theory of all.\n\n2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:21.160\n And you've got our friend at UC Irvine telling them,\n\n2:42:21.160 --> 2:42:24.280\n oh, your senses don't tell you anything about reality.\n\n2:42:24.280 --> 2:42:25.440\n Anyway, reality is what it is.\n\n2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:28.200\n So, you know, what's the purpose of reason?\n\n2:42:28.200 --> 2:42:30.000\n It's to invent stuff, it's to make stuff up.\n\n2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:31.000\n And then what use is that?\n\n2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:32.800\n It's complete fantasy.\n\n2:42:32.800 --> 2:42:35.760\n You've basically got every philosophical,\n\n2:42:35.760 --> 2:42:37.560\n intellectual voice in the culture\n\n2:42:37.560 --> 2:42:40.920\n telling them their reason is impotent.\n\n2:42:40.920 --> 2:42:43.640\n There's like a Steven Pinker who tries,\n\n2:42:43.640 --> 2:42:46.040\n and I love Pinker and he's really good\n\n2:42:46.040 --> 2:42:47.040\n and I love his books,\n\n2:42:48.640 --> 2:42:52.320\n but, you know, he needs to be stronger about this.\n\n2:42:52.320 --> 2:42:54.080\n And there's a few people on kind of,\n\n2:42:54.080 --> 2:42:56.520\n there's a few people partially in the intellectual dark web\n\n2:42:56.520 --> 2:42:58.400\n and otherwise who are big on reason\n\n2:42:58.400 --> 2:43:01.560\n but not consistent enough and not full understanding\n\n2:43:01.560 --> 2:43:04.080\n of what it means or what it implies.\n\n2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:05.680\n And then there's little old me.\n\n2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:10.240\n There's a little old me and it's me against the world\n\n2:43:10.240 --> 2:43:13.160\n in a sense, because I'm not only willing to accept,\n\n2:43:13.160 --> 2:43:16.720\n to articulate the case for reason,\n\n2:43:16.720 --> 2:43:18.680\n but then what that implies.\n\n2:43:18.680 --> 2:43:20.680\n It implies freedom, it implies capitalism,\n\n2:43:20.680 --> 2:43:23.360\n it implies taking personal responsibility over your own life.\n\n2:43:23.360 --> 2:43:25.280\n And there are other intellectual dark web people\n\n2:43:25.280 --> 2:43:28.960\n get to reason and then, oh, politics, you can be whatever.\n\n2:43:28.960 --> 2:43:32.440\n No, you can't, you can't be a socialist and for reason.\n\n2:43:32.440 --> 2:43:35.200\n It doesn't actually, those are incompatible.\n\n2:43:35.200 --> 2:43:38.280\n And you can't be a determinist and for reason.\n\n2:43:38.280 --> 2:43:40.680\n Reason and determinism don't go together.\n\n2:43:40.680 --> 2:43:43.640\n The whole point of reason is that it's an achievement\n\n2:43:43.640 --> 2:43:45.600\n and it requires effort and it requires engagement,\n\n2:43:45.600 --> 2:43:47.360\n it requires choice.\n\n2:43:47.360 --> 2:43:49.720\n So it is, it does feel like a little old me\n\n2:43:49.720 --> 2:43:51.560\n because that's it.\n\n2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:53.520\n The allies I have are allies.\n\n2:43:53.520 --> 2:43:56.760\n I have allies among some libertarians over economics.\n\n2:43:56.760 --> 2:43:58.680\n I have some allies in the intellectual dark web\n\n2:43:58.680 --> 2:44:00.000\n maybe over reason,\n\n2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:02.760\n but none of them are allies in the full sense.\n\n2:44:02.760 --> 2:44:04.560\n So my allies are the other objectivists,\n\n2:44:04.560 --> 2:44:06.120\n but they're not a lot of us.\n\n2:44:07.680 --> 2:44:10.320\n For people listening to this,\n\n2:44:10.320 --> 2:44:12.360\n for the few folks kind of listening to this\n\n2:44:12.360 --> 2:44:16.400\n and thinking about the trajectory of their own life,\n\n2:44:17.760 --> 2:44:22.760\n I guess the takeaway is reason is a difficult project,\n\n2:44:23.920 --> 2:44:27.280\n but a project that's worthy of taking on.\n\n2:44:27.280 --> 2:44:30.040\n Yeah, difficulties, I don't know\n\n2:44:30.040 --> 2:44:31.160\n if difficulty is the right word\n\n2:44:31.160 --> 2:44:33.000\n because difficult sounds like it's,\n\n2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:35.200\n I have to push this boulder up a hill.\n\n2:44:35.200 --> 2:44:37.000\n It's not difficult in that sense.\n\n2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:39.040\n It's difficult in the sense that it requires energy\n\n2:44:39.040 --> 2:44:41.720\n and focus, it requires effort,\n\n2:44:41.720 --> 2:44:43.960\n but it's immediately rewarding.\n\n2:44:43.960 --> 2:44:45.880\n It's fun to do.\n\n2:44:45.880 --> 2:44:50.880\n And it rewards immediate, pretty quick, right?\n\n2:44:51.600 --> 2:44:53.960\n It takes a while to undo all the garbage that you have,\n\n2:44:53.960 --> 2:44:56.640\n but we all have that I had that took me years\n\n2:44:56.640 --> 2:44:58.600\n and years and years to get rid of certain concepts\n\n2:44:58.600 --> 2:45:01.960\n and certain emotions that I had that didn't make any sense,\n\n2:45:01.960 --> 2:45:04.960\n but it takes a long time to fully integrate that.\n\n2:45:04.960 --> 2:45:09.240\n So I don't want it to sound like it's a burden,\n\n2:45:09.240 --> 2:45:11.480\n like it's hard in that sense.\n\n2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:13.760\n It does require focus and energy.\n\n2:45:13.760 --> 2:45:16.760\n And I don't want it to sound like a Dr. Spock.\n\n2:45:16.760 --> 2:45:18.640\n I don't want to say, and I don't think I do\n\n2:45:18.640 --> 2:45:20.360\n because I'm a pretty passionate guy,\n\n2:45:20.360 --> 2:45:22.080\n but I don't want it to appeal like,\n\n2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:24.400\n oh, just forget about emotions.\n\n2:45:24.400 --> 2:45:26.880\n Emotions are how you experience the world.\n\n2:45:26.880 --> 2:45:29.680\n You want to have strong emotions.\n\n2:45:29.680 --> 2:45:33.720\n You want to live, you want to experience life strongly\n\n2:45:33.720 --> 2:45:35.720\n and passionately.\n\n2:45:35.720 --> 2:45:39.560\n You just need to know that emotions are not cognition.\n\n2:45:39.560 --> 2:45:40.680\n It's another realm.\n\n2:45:40.680 --> 2:45:42.440\n It's like, don't mix the realms.\n\n2:45:42.440 --> 2:45:45.360\n Think about outcomes and then experience them.\n\n2:45:45.360 --> 2:45:47.320\n And sometimes your emotions won't coincide\n\n2:45:47.320 --> 2:45:49.920\n with what you think should be.\n\n2:45:49.920 --> 2:45:52.640\n And that means there's still more integration to be done.\n\n2:45:53.640 --> 2:45:55.960\n Yaron, as I told you offline,\n\n2:45:55.960 --> 2:45:58.200\n I've been a fan of yours for a long time.\n\n2:45:58.200 --> 2:46:01.720\n It's been, I was a little starstruck early on,\n\n2:46:01.720 --> 2:46:02.560\n getting a little more comfortable now.\n\n2:46:02.560 --> 2:46:03.560\n I believe that's gone.\n\n2:46:05.960 --> 2:46:09.280\n I highly recommend that people\n\n2:46:09.280 --> 2:46:11.320\n that haven't heard your work,\n\n2:46:11.320 --> 2:46:13.600\n listen to it through the Yaron Brook Show.\n\n2:46:15.480 --> 2:46:18.760\n The times I've disagreed with something I've heard you say\n\n2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:21.880\n is usually a first step on a journey\n\n2:46:21.880 --> 2:46:24.320\n of learning a lot more about that thing,\n\n2:46:24.320 --> 2:46:25.720\n about that viewpoint.\n\n2:46:25.720 --> 2:46:27.240\n And that's been so fulfilling.\n\n2:46:27.240 --> 2:46:28.080\n It's been a gift.\n\n2:46:28.080 --> 2:46:32.040\n The passion, you talk about reason a lot,\n\n2:46:32.040 --> 2:46:35.320\n but the passion radiates in a way\n\n2:46:35.320 --> 2:46:38.080\n that's just contagious and uninspiring.\n\n2:46:38.080 --> 2:46:40.920\n So thank you for everything you've done for this world.\n\n2:46:40.920 --> 2:46:43.440\n It's truly an honor and a pleasure to talk to you.\n\n2:46:43.440 --> 2:46:44.280\n Well, thank you.\n\n2:46:44.280 --> 2:46:48.200\n And my reward is that if I've had an impact\n\n2:46:48.200 --> 2:46:49.920\n on you and people like you, wow.\n\n2:46:49.920 --> 2:46:51.240\n I mean, that's amazing.\n\n2:46:51.240 --> 2:46:54.080\n When you wrote to me an email saying you've been a fan,\n\n2:46:54.080 --> 2:46:56.720\n I was blown away because I had no idea\n\n2:46:56.720 --> 2:46:58.320\n and completely unexpected.\n\n2:46:58.320 --> 2:47:02.280\n And every few months I discover,\n\n2:47:02.280 --> 2:47:03.800\n hey, I had an impact on this world\n\n2:47:03.800 --> 2:47:06.560\n and people that I would have never thought.\n\n2:47:06.560 --> 2:47:09.560\n So the only way to change the world\n\n2:47:10.720 --> 2:47:12.600\n is to change your one mind at a time.\n\n2:47:13.600 --> 2:47:18.040\n And when you have an impact on a good mind\n\n2:47:18.040 --> 2:47:20.120\n and a mind that cares about the world\n\n2:47:20.120 --> 2:47:22.480\n and a mind that goes out and does something about it,\n\n2:47:22.480 --> 2:47:24.760\n then you get the exponential growth.\n\n2:47:24.760 --> 2:47:27.760\n So through you, I've impacted other people\n\n2:47:27.760 --> 2:47:31.760\n and that's how you ultimately change everything.\n\n2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:34.200\n And so in spite of everything,\n\n2:47:34.200 --> 2:47:37.000\n I'm optimistic in a sense that I think\n\n2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:39.760\n that the progress we've made today\n\n2:47:39.760 --> 2:47:41.800\n is so universally accepted,\n\n2:47:41.800 --> 2:47:44.280\n the scientific progress, the technological progress,\n\n2:47:44.280 --> 2:47:48.720\n it can just vanish like it did when Rome collapsed.\n\n2:47:48.720 --> 2:47:51.160\n And whether it's in the United States or somewhere,\n\n2:47:51.160 --> 2:47:55.680\n progress will continue, the human project\n\n2:47:55.680 --> 2:47:57.560\n for human progress will continue.\n\n2:47:57.560 --> 2:47:58.920\n And I think these ideas,\n\n2:47:58.920 --> 2:48:00.760\n the ideas of reason and individualism\n\n2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:02.480\n will always be at the heart of it.\n\n2:48:02.480 --> 2:48:05.640\n And what we are doing is continuing\n\n2:48:05.640 --> 2:48:06.960\n the project of the Enlightenment.\n\n2:48:06.960 --> 2:48:11.920\n And it's the project that will save the human race\n\n2:48:11.920 --> 2:48:14.880\n and allow it to, for Elon Musk\n\n2:48:14.880 --> 2:48:19.040\n and for Jeff Bezos to reach the stars.\n\n2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:22.560\n Thank you for masterfully ending on a hopeful note.\n\n2:48:22.560 --> 2:48:24.320\n Yaron, a pleasure and an honor.\n\n2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:25.680\n Thanks.\n\n2:48:25.680 --> 2:48:27.240\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:48:27.240 --> 2:48:30.480\n with Yaron Brook and thank you to our

fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark\n\n2:49:09.320 --> 2:49:13.080\n in the hopeless swamps of the not quite,\n\n2:49:13.080 --> 2:49:15.920\n the not yet, and the not at all.\n\n2:49:15.920 --> 2:49:19.000\n Do not let the hero in your soul perish\n\n2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:22.240\n in lonely frustration for the life you deserved\n\n2:49:22.240 --> 2:49:24.800\n and have never been able to reach.\n\n2:49:24.800 --> 2:49:27.360\n The world you desire can be one.\n\n2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:32.360\n It exists, it is real, it is possible, it is yours.\n\n2:49:32.360 --> 2:49:45.360\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
