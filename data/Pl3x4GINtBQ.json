  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:05.680\n The following is a conversation with Michael Mallis and Yaron Brook, Michael's third time\n\n00:05.680 --> 00:11.640\n on this podcast and Yaron's second, but together for the first time.\n\n00:11.640 --> 00:18.280\n Michael is an anarchist, political thinker, host of a podcast called You're Welcome and\n\n00:18.280 --> 00:25.220\n author of Dear Reader, The New Right and two upcoming books Anarchist Handbook and The\n\n00:25.220 --> 00:26.680\n White Pill.\n\n00:26.680 --> 00:33.800\n Yaron is an objectivist philosopher, chairman of the Ayn Rand Institute, host of The Yaron\n\n00:33.800 --> 00:41.200\n Brook Show and coauthor of The Free Market Revolution and Equal is Unfair.\n\n00:41.200 --> 00:48.400\n Quick mention of our sponsors, Ground News, Public Goods, Athletic Greens, Brave and Four\n\n00:48.400 --> 00:49.560\n Sigmatic.\n\n00:49.560 --> 00:53.160\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:53.160 --> 00:58.380\n As a side note, let me say that this conversation is a kind of experiment.\n\n00:58.380 --> 01:03.840\n Both Michael and Yaron are thoughtful and passionate, united in part by an interest\n\n01:03.840 --> 01:09.600\n in the history and philosophy of Ayn Rand, but they are also very different in style.\n\n01:09.600 --> 01:16.440\n Good conversation, like good food, is often made delicious by pairing of contrasting elements.\n\n01:16.440 --> 01:22.900\n For example, someone suggested I try a peanut butter, bacon and banana sandwich, which apparently\n\n01:22.900 --> 01:24.640\n is very good.\n\n01:24.640 --> 01:28.240\n Among the three of us, I don't know who's the peanut butter, who's the bacon and who's\n\n01:28.240 --> 01:34.880\n the banana, I'm guessing it's probably me, I'm the banana, but I hope the final result,\n\n01:34.880 --> 01:38.680\n the final dish, if you will, is equally delicious.\n\n01:38.680 --> 01:44.800\n We talk through, I think, a lot of interesting ideas, sometimes disagreeing, sometimes even\n\n01:44.800 --> 01:51.000\n in rare cases saying something humorous, including dark humor, especially in Michael's case.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:55.760\n All three of us are sensitive to the suffering in the world today and throughout human history.\n\n01:55.760 --> 02:00.520\n We think about it, we talk about it, and we deal with it in different ways.\n\n02:00.520 --> 02:02.200\n Be patient with us.\n\n02:02.200 --> 02:07.280\n Whether you agree, disagree, enjoy or dislike the result, I hope you feel listened, you're\n\n02:07.280 --> 02:10.960\n a wiser person on the other end of it, I know I was.\n\n02:10.960 --> 02:17.280\n Mostly, I really enjoyed this conversation because no matter what Michael and Yaron believe,\n\n02:17.280 --> 02:22.600\n underneath it all, they're genuine, kind human beings that I'm lucky to be able to\n\n02:22.600 --> 02:25.420\n hang out with and learn from.\n\n02:25.420 --> 02:31.480\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast and here's my conversation with Michael Malus and Yaron\n\n02:31.480 --> 02:32.480\n Rook.\n\n02:32.480 --> 02:36.800\n I've been a huge fan of the two of you for the longest time.\n\n02:36.800 --> 02:37.800\n Are we recording now?\n\n02:37.800 --> 02:38.800\n Is it starting?\n\n02:38.800 --> 02:39.800\n Or are you just talking?\n\n02:39.800 --> 02:40.800\n I'm not recording at all.\n\n02:40.800 --> 02:43.320\n He's not going to compliment us if it's not part of the show.\n\n02:43.320 --> 02:44.320\n Yes, he does, all the time.\n\n02:44.320 --> 02:45.320\n He speaks very highly of me.\n\n02:45.320 --> 02:46.320\n You, I don't know.\n\n02:46.320 --> 02:47.320\n I'm not sure.\n\n02:47.320 --> 02:48.320\n He only does this to me on the show.\n\n02:48.320 --> 02:53.120\n Objectivists don't like charity, so don't compliment him, he won't think it's sincere.\n\n02:53.120 --> 02:57.360\n So it's an incredible honor that the both of you would show up here.\n\n02:57.360 --> 03:01.600\n If we, let me just ask this sort of profound philosophical question.\n\n03:01.600 --> 03:05.600\n How well do you think we would get along if we were stuck on a desert island together?\n\n03:05.600 --> 03:07.440\n What would life be like?\n\n03:07.440 --> 03:12.100\n I thought the original question you had, that you sent us this question, was how long would\n\n03:12.100 --> 03:13.960\n it take for us to murder one another or something like that.\n\n03:13.960 --> 03:15.600\n There was murder in the question, if I remember.\n\n03:15.600 --> 03:18.600\n I, I, listen, he sent us homework, right?\n\n03:18.600 --> 03:19.600\n All these questions.\n\n03:19.600 --> 03:20.600\n I ignored it.\n\n03:20.600 --> 03:23.720\n I didn't spend four years at Patrick Henry University to do homework.\n\n03:23.720 --> 03:29.160\n To answer your question, I think it would be very easy for us to live together in a\n\n03:29.160 --> 03:30.860\n desert island in terms of interpersonal.\n\n03:30.860 --> 03:34.500\n I know, and I say this because I know a lot of people who have been the show's survivor.\n\n03:34.500 --> 03:36.920\n So they, and I know a little bit about the dynamics.\n\n03:36.920 --> 03:42.680\n So when you have people who are intelligent, who are going to have the same goals, I mean,\n\n03:42.680 --> 03:46.400\n there's space to go away if I'm annoyed at you, I don't think it would be that hard at\n\n03:46.400 --> 03:47.400\n all.\n\n03:47.400 --> 03:48.400\n What's our goals on a desert island?\n\n03:48.400 --> 03:49.400\n Food, shelter.\n\n03:49.400 --> 03:50.400\n Survival.\n\n03:50.400 --> 03:51.400\n Survival.\n\n03:51.400 --> 03:52.400\n Survival, basically.\n\n03:52.400 --> 03:53.400\n Survival and getting out of there, right?\n\n03:53.400 --> 03:54.840\n You don't want to stay on the desert island.\n\n03:54.840 --> 04:01.440\n So yeah, I don't, I don't think, I think that's true of any three, you know, semi rational\n\n04:01.440 --> 04:06.040\n people who, you know, who basically share the goal that they want to survive.\n\n04:06.040 --> 04:07.040\n They want to thrive.\n\n04:07.040 --> 04:09.080\n They want to get off of the island.\n\n04:09.080 --> 04:10.080\n Why would there be conflict?\n\n04:10.080 --> 04:14.560\n I mean, there would be conflict, but, and there can be conflict, but they'd find ways\n\n04:14.560 --> 04:15.560\n to deal with it.\n\n04:15.560 --> 04:20.240\n I don't have this negative view of human beings, particularly not as individuals.\n\n04:20.240 --> 04:26.760\n It's when they get into mobs and groups and collectives that ideology can really motivate\n\n04:26.760 --> 04:28.400\n them to do horrible things.\n\n04:28.400 --> 04:32.960\n One of the things that really drives me crazy is how sinister an impact the book Lord of\n\n04:32.960 --> 04:34.920\n the Flies has had on our culture.\n\n04:34.920 --> 04:36.400\n I read it in high school.\n\n04:36.400 --> 04:37.400\n It's a superb book.\n\n04:37.400 --> 04:39.840\n That's not even a question, but it's not accurate.\n\n04:39.840 --> 04:45.320\n We see in many situations where people are trapped together under difficult circumstances.\n\n04:45.320 --> 04:50.040\n Obviously that book's about children that very quickly it is not about conflict.\n\n04:50.040 --> 04:52.960\n It very quickly becomes about cooperation.\n\n04:52.960 --> 04:53.960\n Let's work together.\n\n04:53.960 --> 04:55.000\n We all have the same goal.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.320\n This is not a time to worry about other things.\n\n04:57.320 --> 05:04.040\n It really, the human beings, the animal instinct that kicks in is the social animal and I'm\n\n05:04.040 --> 05:08.160\n going to shut up and go over there and have a, like stomp my feet instead of arguing with\n\n05:08.160 --> 05:11.760\n your own because we're really trapped in the situation and we need to make it work.\n\n05:11.760 --> 05:14.880\n Well, and to the extent that they're bad people, bad people are dealt with, right?\n\n05:14.880 --> 05:19.360\n So this is true of all of, you know, how did we survive as a species, right?\n\n05:19.360 --> 05:20.640\n How have we survived as a species?\n\n05:20.640 --> 05:24.280\n We've been on a desert island in a sense as a species forever.\n\n05:24.280 --> 05:25.280\n Tribes survived.\n\n05:25.280 --> 05:26.280\n They survived by cooperation.\n\n05:26.280 --> 05:31.200\n They survived by dealing with bad people.\n\n05:31.200 --> 05:37.040\n Civilization is created by people cooperating and working together and allowing individuals\n\n05:37.040 --> 05:43.120\n to thrive within the group and when bad people arise, they deal with them, right?\n\n05:43.120 --> 05:50.700\n Now sometimes these groups get captured by bad people and bad ideas and probably from\n\n05:50.700 --> 05:52.900\n day one that was going on, right?\n\n05:52.900 --> 05:59.380\n The whole tribe is probably a bad idea to begin with, but you know, underneath it all,\n\n05:59.380 --> 06:06.400\n the fact is that to survive as a species, we need to think, we need to be rational and\n\n06:06.400 --> 06:10.720\n if we don't have any respect for reason, then we would all die.\n\n06:10.720 --> 06:11.840\n We would die off.\n\n06:11.840 --> 06:15.000\n So that's a hopeful message, but where does that go wrong?\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:19.440\n So with three people we might get along, we would focus on the basics of life, we have\n\n06:19.440 --> 06:20.600\n similar goals.\n\n06:20.600 --> 06:26.400\n Once women are introduced, their incessant irrationalism and less of their hormones for\n\n06:26.400 --> 06:27.400\n SOL.\n\n06:27.400 --> 06:31.200\n Look, three of us on a desert island would be nice, but without women, it wouldn't be\n\n06:31.200 --> 06:32.200\n fun.\n\n06:32.200 --> 06:34.960\n I'm going to edit out half the things Michael said through this broadcast.\n\n06:34.960 --> 06:37.320\n As you know, I used to run the Ayn Rand Institute.\n\n06:37.320 --> 06:38.880\n She was a woman last time I looked.\n\n06:38.880 --> 06:39.880\n Oh, wait a minute.\n\n06:39.880 --> 06:42.560\n You know, you know exactly what I'm going to say.\n\n06:42.560 --> 06:47.840\n When Ludwig von Mises or Hazlitt, I don't know who it was, Mises was praising Ayn Rand\n\n06:47.840 --> 06:50.320\n and I think it was Hazlitt who said it to her.\n\n06:50.320 --> 06:54.160\n He said, Ludwig von Mises said, you're the smartest man I've ever met.\n\n06:54.160 --> 06:56.520\n And Ayn Rand said, did he say man?\n\n06:56.520 --> 06:57.520\n Right?\n\n06:57.520 --> 06:58.520\n No, she viewed as a compliment.\n\n06:58.520 --> 06:59.520\n Right.\n\n06:59.520 --> 07:00.520\n But she wanted to be clear that he said man.\n\n07:00.520 --> 07:01.520\n She was excited.\n\n07:01.520 --> 07:02.520\n Yes.\n\n07:02.520 --> 07:03.520\n Absolutely.\n\n07:03.520 --> 07:07.760\n I took it as her perceiving him as seeing her as a full equal.\n\n07:07.760 --> 07:09.080\n Oh, I think that's right.\n\n07:09.080 --> 07:10.080\n I think that's right.\n\n07:10.080 --> 07:15.400\n Plus, I think the perception out there, the perception in the culture of man as being\n\n07:15.400 --> 07:22.960\n rational was a compliment to her because that was affirming that he viewed her as a rational.\n\n07:22.960 --> 07:24.440\n Yeah, because Mises is old school.\n\n07:24.440 --> 07:28.360\n He's an older Eastern European guy, so he would definitely have these rigid views.\n\n07:28.360 --> 07:33.240\n Like his wife, I read her autobiography, Margit von Mises, and basically he made her his secretary\n\n07:33.240 --> 07:37.560\n to the point where if he's typing something or he had something handwritten, she had to\n\n07:37.560 --> 07:38.560\n type it out.\n\n07:38.560 --> 07:41.660\n And if she made a typo, he would tear up the page, she had to start from the beginning.\n\n07:41.660 --> 07:44.400\n But it's like, this is the role of the man, this is the role of the woman.\n\n07:44.400 --> 07:47.560\n So for him to regard her, this was kind of a breaking through moment.\n\n07:47.560 --> 07:51.320\n Not that she was secretly misogynist.\n\n07:51.320 --> 07:55.680\n So I think we go wrong when people try to understand the world around them and come\n\n07:55.680 --> 07:57.680\n up with wrong ideas.\n\n07:57.680 --> 08:02.360\n And it's natural that they would come up with wrong ideas because it's hard to figure out\n\n08:02.360 --> 08:03.580\n what's right.\n\n08:03.580 --> 08:10.000\n So we start with trying to come up with mystical explanations for the existence of the things\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:11.780\n around us.\n\n08:11.780 --> 08:16.720\n And that I think very quickly leads to some people being able to communicate with the\n\n08:16.720 --> 08:20.920\n mystical stuff out there and some people not being able to communicate and some people\n\n08:20.920 --> 08:27.380\n wanting to control other people and using those pseudo explanations as a way to control.\n\n08:27.380 --> 08:31.100\n So you always have, Rand called it Attila and the witch doctor.\n\n08:31.100 --> 08:37.320\n You always have a witch doctor, the mystic, the philosopher, the intellectual, the philosopher\n\n08:37.320 --> 08:43.640\n king, and you have an Attila, you have somebody who wants control of the people, who's willing\n\n08:43.640 --> 08:45.960\n to use force to control other people.\n\n08:45.960 --> 08:49.400\n And when those two get together, that's when things go bad.\n\n08:49.400 --> 08:57.560\n And unfortunately, 95, 98% of human history is when those two are together.\n\n08:57.560 --> 09:02.120\n And so the not having them together, having the right ideas, and the right ideas are ones\n\n09:02.120 --> 09:07.720\n that are not exclusive to those guys and where we don't allow Attila to have that kind of\n\n09:07.720 --> 09:13.920\n physical power over us, that's an exception and that's rare and that's what needs to be\n\n09:13.920 --> 09:14.920\n defended.\n\n09:14.920 --> 09:15.920\n Yeah.\n\n09:15.920 --> 09:16.920\n Stalin's not personally killing people.\n\n09:16.920 --> 09:17.920\n Hitler's not personally killing people.\n\n09:17.920 --> 09:18.960\n Charles Manson's not personally killing people.\n\n09:18.960 --> 09:20.320\n They need their goons.\n\n09:20.320 --> 09:25.640\n They need their goons, but also they don't have original ideas.\n\n09:25.640 --> 09:28.280\n Everything Stalin says is original to him, right?\n\n09:28.280 --> 09:31.140\n He needs a Marx, even Lenin, right?\n\n09:31.140 --> 09:33.040\n They all need a Marx, right?\n\n09:33.040 --> 09:40.020\n And Marx needs a particular line of thinkers that come before him that set him up for these\n\n09:40.020 --> 09:41.260\n kind of ideas.\n\n09:41.260 --> 09:45.320\n So Stalin both needs his goons, even though he's somewhat of a goon, particularly Stalin.\n\n09:45.320 --> 09:46.760\n Yeah, he's a bank robber, yeah.\n\n09:46.760 --> 09:51.300\n And then, so take Lenin, Lenin I think is a better example because Lenin's more intellectual\n\n09:51.300 --> 09:52.300\n if you will.\n\n09:52.300 --> 09:56.320\n Lenin needs his goons, he needs his Stalins, but Lenin also needs his Marx.\n\n09:56.320 --> 10:02.000\n And we don't want to let Marx off the hook because Marx knows, I think, implicitly that\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:05.340\n his ideas have to lead to Lenin and Stalin.\n\n10:05.340 --> 10:06.640\n His ideas are not neutral.\n\n10:06.640 --> 10:08.200\n I don't think it's implicit at all.\n\n10:08.200 --> 10:14.080\n I think Marx very much glorified revolution, blood and terror, this is not implicit in\n\n10:14.080 --> 10:15.080\n the slightest.\n\n10:15.080 --> 10:16.080\n No, absolutely.\n\n10:16.080 --> 10:17.800\n I mean, there are letters between him and Engels where they talk about which peoples\n\n10:17.800 --> 10:23.720\n will have to be eliminated because they don't have that proletarian thing, right?\n\n10:23.720 --> 10:31.360\n So I think certain peoples in Southern Europe are not appropriate for the utopia to come\n\n10:31.360 --> 10:32.940\n and will have to be gone.\n\n10:32.940 --> 10:38.600\n And Marx also had this concept which we still see today in garbled ways of polylogism, which\n\n10:38.600 --> 10:44.680\n is if you're a capitalist and I'm bourgeois or I'm a worker, your logic is different than\n\n10:44.680 --> 10:45.680\n mine.\n\n10:45.680 --> 10:47.800\n It's really going to be impossible for us to communicate.\n\n10:47.800 --> 10:49.920\n And at a certain point, you're going to have to be liquidated.\n\n10:49.920 --> 10:52.480\n And they pretend that doesn't mean murdered, but it means murdered.\n\n10:52.480 --> 10:54.600\n And very quickly, everyone becomes a capitalist or bourgeois.\n\n10:54.600 --> 10:57.760\n And then you have the Holodomor and things like this.\n\n10:57.760 --> 10:59.800\n No, he knows exactly where it's going to lead.\n\n10:59.800 --> 11:02.640\n And this is why people say, oh, Marx is not evil.\n\n11:02.640 --> 11:03.640\n He just wrote books.\n\n11:03.640 --> 11:09.180\n No, it's the people who write books who are responsible for the way history evolves.\n\n11:09.180 --> 11:16.040\n And they know the bad guys certainly know the consequence of their ideas, and they need\n\n11:16.040 --> 11:20.600\n to bear the moral responsibility for what happens when the ideas are implemented.\n\n11:20.600 --> 11:21.600\n Here's a way.\n\n11:21.600 --> 11:22.600\n Can I ask a question?\n\n11:22.600 --> 11:23.600\n Yeah.\n\n11:23.600 --> 11:24.600\n Because I think I know more about Rand than Yaron does.\n\n11:24.600 --> 11:25.600\n So let's see.\n\n11:25.600 --> 11:26.600\n Oh.\n\n11:26.600 --> 11:27.600\n Okay.\n\n11:27.600 --> 11:28.600\n The gauntlet has been thrown down.\n\n11:28.600 --> 11:30.880\n Who did Ayn Rand say is the most evil man who ever lived?\n\n11:30.880 --> 11:31.880\n Immanuel Kant.\n\n11:31.880 --> 11:32.880\n That's right.\n\n11:32.880 --> 11:33.880\n Correct.\n\n11:33.880 --> 11:34.880\n No, that I know.\n\n11:34.880 --> 11:36.640\n I mean, it's a big deal that Immanuel Kant is.\n\n11:36.640 --> 11:41.240\n And most people don't understand why, because if you read Kant, there's certain passages\n\n11:41.240 --> 11:47.040\n in Kant that sound pretty liberal, they sound pretty, it sounds like he's for the individual,\n\n11:47.040 --> 11:50.120\n he sounds like he's for the American Revolution, things like that.\n\n11:50.120 --> 11:53.360\n But when you actually read his philosophy and what he's trying to defend and what he's\n\n11:53.360 --> 11:59.160\n trying to undermine, he's trying to undermine the foundations that make the revolution possible,\n\n11:59.160 --> 12:01.600\n that make freedom and individualism possible.\n\n12:01.600 --> 12:03.560\n He's trying to destroy the Enlightenment.\n\n12:03.560 --> 12:08.960\n And the Enlightenment are those ideas that make freedom, individualism feasible.\n\n12:08.960 --> 12:10.720\n He's trying to undermine reason.\n\n12:10.720 --> 12:14.240\n And without reason, we're nothing.\n\n12:14.240 --> 12:16.240\n We can't survive as a species.\n\n12:16.240 --> 12:21.520\n And that's why she thought he was the most evil person, because his ideas undermine the\n\n12:21.520 --> 12:27.000\n very foundations of what it requires to be a human being, reason and individualism.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.240\n Those are the things he's trying to eviscerate.\n\n12:29.240 --> 12:32.480\n I know you've talked about Hoffman before.\n\n12:32.480 --> 12:42.520\n So Hoffman is a modern day attempt to, Donald Hoffman, Donald Hoffman is the University\n\n12:42.520 --> 12:47.520\n of California, Irvine, a neurologist, a neuroscientist, something like that.\n\n12:47.520 --> 12:53.040\n So I met him once and we were at one of these conferences where you do a quick intro, you\n\n12:53.040 --> 12:54.040\n sit and you do a quick intro.\n\n12:54.040 --> 12:58.560\n His introduction was, I've just written a book that proves that evolution has conditioned\n\n12:58.560 --> 13:03.000\n us not to see reality.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\n That is very Kantian.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:05.000\n Yeah.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:13.120\n And he is basically just presenting pseudoscience to defend Kant's position about epistemology\n\n13:13.120 --> 13:14.920\n and about metaphysics.\n\n13:14.920 --> 13:18.200\n And there's nothing original there.\n\n13:18.200 --> 13:23.200\n And he puts up a bunch of equations and he says, I ran a simulation and it proves I'm\n\n13:23.200 --> 13:24.200\n right.\n\n13:24.200 --> 13:28.560\n So Yaron is a little bit frustrated with Donald Hoffman's work.\n\n13:28.560 --> 13:29.560\n Let me...\n\n13:29.560 --> 13:30.560\n I'm not frustrated.\n\n13:30.560 --> 13:35.960\n I just think it's completely wrong and it's anti life, anti mind, anti evolution.\n\n13:35.960 --> 13:38.260\n I think he's an anti evolutionist at the end.\n\n13:38.260 --> 13:42.160\n And I think it, you know, anytime you say, look, here's the important point.\n\n13:42.160 --> 13:47.200\n Anytime you say reality doesn't exist, well, who are you?\n\n13:47.200 --> 13:48.200\n What do you mean by reality?\n\n13:48.200 --> 13:49.280\n What do any of your words mean?\n\n13:49.280 --> 13:52.880\n What does anything you say even mean if it doesn't refer to something that's actually\n\n13:52.880 --> 13:53.880\n out there in reality?\n\n13:53.880 --> 14:00.040\n I try to defend this point of view because in a certain kind of sense, I hear it as being\n\n14:00.040 --> 14:03.520\n humble in the face of the uncertainty that's around us.\n\n14:03.520 --> 14:10.840\n Sort of, you know, when you speak with the confidence of Ayn Rand and yourself, that\n\n14:10.840 --> 14:16.000\n reason can be like this weapon that cuts through all the bullshit of the world and makes us\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:19.680\n like have an ethical moral life and all those kinds of things.\n\n14:19.680 --> 14:24.760\n You kind of assume that reason is a superpower that has no limits.\n\n14:24.760 --> 14:27.760\n Wait, hold on, hold on a second.\n\n14:27.760 --> 14:31.960\n But I got this one.\n\n14:31.960 --> 14:37.520\n See this is already leading to a murder by words and we've been only talking for 20 minutes.\n\n14:37.520 --> 14:40.520\n The three of us wouldn't get together, we wouldn't get along together on an island.\n\n14:40.520 --> 14:42.000\n We'll just make him our slave.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:43.920\n We're all going to get along.\n\n14:43.920 --> 14:44.920\n He's just going to do the work.\n\n14:44.920 --> 14:49.840\n But I'm afraid I cannot provide any value as a slave, so this is not going to end well\n\n14:49.840 --> 14:50.840\n for me.\n\n14:50.840 --> 14:52.640\n We could provide value as dinner.\n\n14:52.640 --> 14:54.160\n That's the problem I'm trying to get to.\n\n14:54.160 --> 14:55.160\n That's a solution.\n\n14:55.160 --> 14:56.160\n Okay.\n\n14:56.160 --> 15:04.760\n But Donald Hoffman says that there is like he makes an argument that exactly as you said,\n\n15:04.760 --> 15:12.460\n that what we perceive is not, is very, very far from actual physical reality.\n\n15:12.460 --> 15:17.600\n In fact, we're not able to perceive the physical reality at all.\n\n15:17.600 --> 15:26.520\n And he also makes the bigger claim that evolution prefers beings who are not attached to reality.\n\n15:26.520 --> 15:31.160\n So like evolution created creatures that are basically functioning way outside of what\n\n15:31.160 --> 15:32.160\n the physical reality is.\n\n15:32.160 --> 15:33.160\n I got this.\n\n15:33.160 --> 15:34.160\n I got this.\n\n15:34.160 --> 15:35.160\n Okay.\n\n15:35.160 --> 15:37.160\n Because there's a lot to unpack here and I hate all of it.\n\n15:37.160 --> 15:38.160\n Okay.\n\n15:38.160 --> 15:40.120\n First of all, no, no, I'm serious.\n\n15:40.120 --> 15:44.800\n First of all, when you were making that comment about how, you know, reason is a superpower\n\n15:44.800 --> 15:48.800\n beyond limit, you're being ironic, but it's true.\n\n15:48.800 --> 15:51.000\n And I'll give you one example, which is astronomy.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:55.980\n If you look at the physical size of the universe, it's literally in one sense incomprehensible.\n\n15:55.980 --> 16:00.440\n So he's right in the sense that I do not understand and none of us understand what it means for\n\n16:00.440 --> 16:02.440\n 93 million miles away for the sun to be.\n\n16:02.440 --> 16:05.260\n It makes no, it's a number on another screen, right?\n\n16:05.260 --> 16:10.880\n That said, the fact that my mind, and I'm not one of the great thinkers of all time\n\n16:10.880 --> 16:19.080\n is getting there, is capable of appreciating what the sun means, what heliocentrism means.\n\n16:19.080 --> 16:23.720\n The fact that we can, you know, you're a math person that you could look at galaxies and\n\n16:23.720 --> 16:31.120\n reduce it to 10 to the 64th power in terms of distance that shows the unlimited capacity\n\n16:31.120 --> 16:32.720\n of the human mind and reason.\n\n16:32.720 --> 16:33.720\n Number one.\n\n16:33.720 --> 16:41.360\n Number two is if he says that evolution favors those who are not in touch with reality, and\n\n16:41.360 --> 16:44.320\n I don't know in what context he's saying that because that sentence could mean a lot of\n\n16:44.320 --> 16:46.440\n different things.\n\n16:46.440 --> 16:50.900\n Evolution is what guides, reality is what guides evolution.\n\n16:50.900 --> 16:56.680\n Evolution works because you are fitted to the reality of the situation around you.\n\n16:56.680 --> 17:01.440\n It's not that someone is sitting down and says, well, I'm going to add a fin to this\n\n17:01.440 --> 17:04.160\n animal and that fin helps it swim.\n\n17:04.160 --> 17:05.720\n I engineered a check mark.\n\n17:05.720 --> 17:08.360\n It's that mutations occur.\n\n17:08.360 --> 17:11.680\n The vast majority of these mutations are against reality.\n\n17:11.680 --> 17:16.640\n They do not further this animal's life or this plant's life or this fungus's life, but\n\n17:16.640 --> 17:22.300\n the ones that are in touch with reality, such as, okay, it's really cold here.\n\n17:22.300 --> 17:23.920\n There's no predators here.\n\n17:23.920 --> 17:28.280\n If I could figure out, and I'm using that term very loosely, a way where I could survive\n\n17:28.280 --> 17:30.480\n in the cold, I don't have predation.\n\n17:30.480 --> 17:31.760\n It's really great.\n\n17:31.760 --> 17:38.840\n The fact that unconsciously and mindlessly this process can force the mutation and evolution\n\n17:38.840 --> 17:42.000\n of the form precisely means that they're in touch with reality.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:47.040\n Now, if he means the consciousness is not in touch with reality, that's another thing\n\n17:47.040 --> 17:48.400\n that I really hate.\n\n17:48.400 --> 17:52.440\n You're referring to the reality as like the biological reality of evolution, but all of\n\n17:52.440 --> 17:57.680\n that is based on many other layers of abstraction that ultimately has quantum mechanics underneath\n\n17:57.680 --> 18:01.720\n it all, and he's saying somewhere along the layers, you start to lose more and more and\n\n18:01.720 --> 18:02.720\n more attachment to the actual.\n\n18:02.720 --> 18:03.720\n Hold on.\n\n18:03.720 --> 18:04.720\n Can I add one more sentence?\n\n18:04.720 --> 18:05.720\n Sure, sure.\n\n18:05.720 --> 18:11.960\n I do not, I despise the idea, I say despise, I'm not using this, I'm not joking, the idea\n\n18:11.960 --> 18:17.080\n that the reality we don't live in is somehow more real than this.\n\n18:17.080 --> 18:20.920\n That is a very dangerous idea to say, well, quantum works in this way, and I'm sure he's\n\n18:20.920 --> 18:23.880\n correct and none of us disagree with that.\n\n18:23.880 --> 18:28.200\n What we perceive, macro, works in a different way, well, that's the real reality and this\n\n18:28.200 --> 18:29.200\n is fake.\n\n18:29.200 --> 18:30.200\n Bullshit.\n\n18:30.200 --> 18:31.200\n Yeah.\n\n18:31.200 --> 18:32.200\n This is the real reality.\n\n18:32.200 --> 18:37.280\n That is a different type, a subset, but no one's living there, and humanity is the starting\n\n18:37.280 --> 18:38.280\n point.\n\n18:38.280 --> 18:41.760\n It's a subset that has to integrate with this world.\n\n18:41.760 --> 18:44.840\n There isn't two worlds, one in the quantum world and one here.\n\n18:44.840 --> 18:45.840\n They're integrated.\n\n18:45.840 --> 18:49.040\n Now, we might not have the scientific knowledge to know how they're integrated, but so what?\n\n18:49.040 --> 18:52.360\n We know that there's only one reality and that's this one.\n\n18:52.360 --> 18:53.440\n He has this difference.\n\n18:53.440 --> 18:59.960\n He says, evolution matches up to fitness, not to reality, and he creates this dichotomy\n\n18:59.960 --> 19:03.320\n between fitness and reality, but that's complete nonsense.\n\n19:03.320 --> 19:08.980\n There is no such thing as a concept of fitness outside of fitness to what?\n\n19:08.980 --> 19:10.640\n To reality.\n\n19:10.640 --> 19:12.400\n Fitness and reality are the same thing.\n\n19:12.400 --> 19:14.180\n They're not separate things.\n\n19:14.180 --> 19:21.300\n The whole way he sets this up intellectually is wrong, I think to some extent dishonest,\n\n19:21.300 --> 19:23.140\n and certainly philosophically corrupt.\n\n19:23.140 --> 19:24.140\n It's Kantian.\n\n19:24.140 --> 19:29.520\n Again, he's accepted Kant's ideas, and everybody pretty much has accepted Kant's ideas for\n\n19:29.520 --> 19:32.960\n the last 200 years, and they give it a different facade.\n\n19:32.960 --> 19:37.000\n He's giving it an evolutionary facade, but it's just a facade for the same idea, and\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:43.080\n that is that somehow because we have eyes, we cannot see, because the light waves are\n\n19:43.080 --> 19:46.440\n going through a medium, and that medium necessarily distorted.\n\n19:46.440 --> 19:49.720\n The medium changes the resolution at which you see.\n\n19:49.720 --> 19:52.640\n If I take off my glasses, I'm seeing it a little differently.\n\n19:52.640 --> 19:56.480\n The thing is still there, and the thing is still there in the way I see it, because I'm\n\n19:56.480 --> 19:58.840\n grasping the handle and lifting the cup.\n\n19:58.840 --> 19:59.840\n That's not an illusion.\n\n19:59.840 --> 20:00.840\n That is a real cup.\n\n20:00.840 --> 20:03.320\n So do you think some things are more real than others?\n\n20:03.320 --> 20:04.320\n For example, money.\n\n20:04.320 --> 20:08.360\n There's a bunch of things that seem real.\n\n20:08.360 --> 20:09.640\n This is not an Animal Farm reference.\n\n20:09.640 --> 20:11.800\n Is this going to be about love?\n\n20:11.800 --> 20:16.200\n There's nothing as real as love, right Lex?\n\n20:16.200 --> 20:19.360\n Love is a fundamental part of the quantum mechanics, yes.\n\n20:19.360 --> 20:20.360\n No.\n\n20:20.360 --> 20:21.360\n No.\n\n20:21.360 --> 20:22.360\n No.\n\n20:22.360 --> 20:27.400\n There are some things that have become reality because we humans, in a collective sense,\n\n20:27.400 --> 20:28.520\n believe it.\n\n20:28.520 --> 20:30.320\n You can't believe something collectively.\n\n20:30.320 --> 20:31.960\n Now it doesn't become real.\n\n20:31.960 --> 20:33.800\n What does it mean to say something's real?\n\n20:33.800 --> 20:36.880\n That is, you can, so love, for example, love's a good example, right?\n\n20:36.880 --> 20:38.640\n Love is an abstraction, right?\n\n20:38.640 --> 20:40.280\n It's not something I can touch.\n\n20:40.280 --> 20:42.960\n It's not something I can see, but it's certainly something you would feel.\n\n20:42.960 --> 20:45.880\n Not something you can hit.\n\n20:45.880 --> 20:46.880\n We love differently.\n\n20:46.880 --> 20:47.880\n You and I.\n\n20:47.880 --> 20:48.880\n I don't think that's true.\n\n20:48.880 --> 20:49.880\n I think I'm just too honest about it.\n\n20:49.880 --> 20:50.880\n You can't hit love.\n\n20:50.880 --> 20:53.160\n You can't, love is an abstraction.\n\n20:53.160 --> 20:54.160\n So is love real?\n\n20:54.160 --> 20:56.460\n Yes, it's real because I feel it.\n\n20:56.460 --> 21:00.440\n It's an existent, but it's not an existent in the same sense as this cup is.\n\n21:00.440 --> 21:07.920\n So abstractions are real, but at the end of the day, all abstractions have to be able\n\n21:07.920 --> 21:14.640\n to be reduced to actual concrete so you can either see it.\n\n21:14.640 --> 21:19.240\n I really don't like criticizing someone whose work I haven't read secondhand.\n\n21:19.240 --> 21:22.440\n So I want to take this away from speaking about him personally, because I'm not familiar\n\n21:22.440 --> 21:23.440\n with his work.\n\n21:23.440 --> 21:24.440\n He is a nice guy.\n\n21:24.440 --> 21:25.440\n That makes me like him.\n\n21:25.440 --> 21:26.440\n That makes him like him less.\n\n21:26.440 --> 21:31.120\n Now you're back talking about evolutionary fitness again.\n\n21:31.120 --> 21:39.480\n I think there's disingenuousness when we talk about the word real in terms of ideas are\n\n21:39.480 --> 21:45.480\n real versus the cup is real, and you try to switch back between those two meanings, and\n\n21:45.480 --> 21:51.240\n it's a little bit of linguistic wordplay that is trying to force a point that's not accurate,\n\n21:51.240 --> 21:52.240\n in my opinion.\n\n21:52.240 --> 21:57.520\n Well, I think the issue is, and what he's challenging is, and what Kant is challenging\n\n21:57.520 --> 22:01.280\n is, do we know reality?\n\n22:01.280 --> 22:03.320\n And I think the answer is yes, we do.\n\n22:03.320 --> 22:04.320\n We know reality.\n\n22:04.320 --> 22:05.320\n We observe it.\n\n22:05.320 --> 22:07.680\n Now, do we know everything about reality?\n\n22:07.680 --> 22:08.680\n No.\n\n22:08.680 --> 22:12.720\n We can't, for example, sense what a bat senses as reality.\n\n22:12.720 --> 22:16.000\n A bat observes reality through, what is it?\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:17.000\n Sonar.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:18.000\n Sound waves, right?\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:19.000\n Yeah.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:20.000\n Through sonar.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:21.000\n Right?\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:22.000\n So it has a different sense, but it's the same reality.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:23.000\n It's still a table.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:28.160\n The bat's spatial relationship to the table is different than ours, but the object is\n\n22:28.160 --> 22:29.160\n still the same object.\n\n22:29.160 --> 22:31.240\n But how do you know that's true?\n\n22:31.240 --> 22:34.320\n Are you not just hoping that's true or assuming that's true?\n\n22:34.320 --> 22:35.960\n That's what no means.\n\n22:35.960 --> 22:39.720\n No means I have identified an aspect of reality.\n\n22:39.720 --> 22:41.880\n That's literally the definition of knowledge.\n\n22:41.880 --> 22:43.600\n Now if you say, how are you certain?\n\n22:43.600 --> 22:47.880\n Well, that's a whole other question, but one of the reasons I know it was certain is because\n\n22:47.880 --> 22:48.880\n this happens.\n\n22:48.880 --> 22:49.880\n Yes.\n\n22:49.880 --> 22:50.880\n Okay.\n\n22:50.880 --> 22:51.880\n And I know this is going to happen.\n\n22:51.880 --> 22:55.500\n And if I tell you, if you go downstairs, you're going to see, you know, Mr. Jones and you\n\n22:55.500 --> 22:59.840\n walk downstairs and I see Mr. Jones, at the very least, you know, something's going on\n\n22:59.840 --> 23:00.840\n there.\n\n23:00.840 --> 23:02.720\n So what about all the things that mess with our perception?\n\n23:02.720 --> 23:05.320\n For example, we've talked about psychedelics before.\n\n23:05.320 --> 23:10.640\n Talked about in dreams where you'd be detached from this, I mean, there's certain things\n\n23:10.640 --> 23:12.920\n that happen to your brain to where you're not able to perceive.\n\n23:12.920 --> 23:14.320\n So you're not perceiving reality.\n\n23:14.320 --> 23:15.320\n That's right.\n\n23:15.320 --> 23:16.720\n So your brain is creating a different reality.\n\n23:16.720 --> 23:17.720\n It's not real.\n\n23:17.720 --> 23:19.200\n How do you know it's not real?\n\n23:19.200 --> 23:21.880\n How do you know the elves will meet in the...\n\n23:21.880 --> 23:26.920\n Because partially because I need to take a drug in order to do it, because I'm asleep\n\n23:26.920 --> 23:28.560\n when I'm dreaming.\n\n23:28.560 --> 23:29.560\n It's not reality.\n\n23:29.560 --> 23:33.560\n That is clearly a creation of our mind.\n\n23:33.560 --> 23:34.560\n It's not a creed.\n\n23:34.560 --> 23:35.560\n Hold on.\n\n23:35.560 --> 23:36.560\n Let's get to the psychedelics.\n\n23:36.560 --> 23:37.560\n The drug is real.\n\n23:37.560 --> 23:42.240\n I think you're going to be thinking I'm joking a lot more than I am this episode.\n\n23:42.240 --> 23:43.960\n I'm going to be the humorist objectivist.\n\n23:43.960 --> 23:47.820\n He could be the court jester.\n\n23:47.820 --> 23:51.880\n In terms of psychedelic, when people are perceiving these elves, these machine elves, these other\n\n23:51.880 --> 23:57.200\n entities, whether they could either be real or not, I don't know.\n\n23:57.200 --> 24:02.880\n But the point is that doesn't go to his broader point because if these beings exist and the\n\n24:02.880 --> 24:06.720\n only way to perceive them is to take a drug, they still exist.\n\n24:06.720 --> 24:07.720\n This is just...\n\n24:07.720 --> 24:14.640\n For example, if I'm walking outside in the woods at night and there's a deer and I can't\n\n24:14.640 --> 24:17.740\n see it, but if I put on night vision goggles, I can see it.\n\n24:17.740 --> 24:19.600\n That deer was there the entire time.\n\n24:19.600 --> 24:22.780\n It's not that the night vision goggles caused the deer to appear.\n\n24:22.780 --> 24:28.160\n You can recreate it not only using night vision goggles, but you can then use sonar.\n\n24:28.160 --> 24:31.840\n You can use other mechanisms by which to prove that the deer is there.\n\n24:31.840 --> 24:36.600\n The thing with psychedelics is that...I don't know because maybe I'm the least experienced\n\n24:36.600 --> 24:38.640\n with psychedelics here probably.\n\n24:38.640 --> 24:41.480\n My guess is every time you take the psychedelic, you have exactly the same experience of the\n\n24:41.480 --> 24:42.480\n deer.\n\n24:42.480 --> 24:43.480\n No.\n\n24:43.480 --> 24:48.000\n Second, are there other mechanisms, other scientific mechanisms by which I can find\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.880\n the deer out there other than the psychedelics?\n\n24:50.880 --> 24:51.880\n We don't know yet.\n\n24:51.880 --> 24:52.880\n So...\n\n24:52.880 --> 24:53.880\n Well, we don't know yet.\n\n24:53.880 --> 24:54.880\n Well, but the...\n\n24:54.880 --> 24:56.520\n This is Occam's Razor, right?\n\n24:56.520 --> 25:02.340\n The simplest explanation here is the most likely, and that is that you've taken something\n\n25:02.340 --> 25:07.080\n that's messing with the chemicals in the brain, something is being...that your brain can project.\n\n25:07.080 --> 25:08.080\n We dream.\n\n25:08.080 --> 25:12.600\n Nobody's arguing that the dream is real and reality is not, or if they are, I think they're\n\n25:12.600 --> 25:13.600\n nuts.\n\n25:13.600 --> 25:15.360\n The dream is a dream.\n\n25:15.360 --> 25:20.680\n Your brain is creating an image of telling you a story.\n\n25:20.680 --> 25:22.160\n Psychedelics are simulating the same thing.\n\n25:22.160 --> 25:25.240\n That's probably what's going on until there's evidence to the contrary.\n\n25:25.240 --> 25:26.240\n Well, hold on.\n\n25:26.240 --> 25:29.360\n Let me disagree with you a little bit, because let's take Adderall, for example.\n\n25:29.360 --> 25:30.360\n No one here disagrees.\n\n25:30.360 --> 25:34.520\n That's something much more simpler and less out of this world.\n\n25:34.520 --> 25:37.720\n I think what he might be speaking to, I know Joe Rogan talks about this and other people\n\n25:37.720 --> 25:41.080\n in this space, is that when you take certain drugs, it changes your perception.\n\n25:41.080 --> 25:44.040\n It doesn't have to be otherworldly, it changes your perception of what's around you.\n\n25:44.040 --> 25:47.400\n And as an example, what they talk about is, the three of us are talking, there's lots\n\n25:47.400 --> 25:50.960\n of other stuff in the room, we're only aware of it vaguely on a personal level.\n\n25:50.960 --> 25:51.960\n So it changes the...\n\n25:51.960 --> 25:52.960\n Hold on, let me finish.\n\n25:52.960 --> 25:53.960\n No, I don't do that.\n\n25:53.960 --> 25:54.960\n I'm Israeli.\n\n25:54.960 --> 25:55.960\n You're about to start.\n\n25:55.960 --> 25:58.680\n This is back to the desert island of murder.\n\n25:58.680 --> 26:00.800\n No, but we just resolved it within three seconds.\n\n26:00.800 --> 26:01.800\n We did.\n\n26:01.800 --> 26:02.800\n There's no conch.\n\n26:02.800 --> 26:05.800\n He's trying to get us to feed on the truth.\n\n26:05.800 --> 26:06.800\n Yeah, it's not going to happen.\n\n26:06.800 --> 26:07.800\n Exactly.\n\n26:07.800 --> 26:08.800\n I'm trying to create murder.\n\n26:08.800 --> 26:09.800\n No one has asthma.\n\n26:09.800 --> 26:10.800\n It's going to be fine.\n\n26:10.800 --> 26:12.760\n Because if the two of you murder each other, there's more food for me.\n\n26:12.760 --> 26:13.760\n There's no food.\n\n26:13.760 --> 26:14.760\n You're all...\n\n26:14.760 --> 26:15.760\n Well, ratings would go up.\n\n26:15.760 --> 26:16.760\n You robots eat alcohol.\n\n26:16.760 --> 26:17.760\n Ratings would go up.\n\n26:17.760 --> 26:18.760\n Viewership would go up.\n\n26:18.760 --> 26:19.760\n Yeah, it's good for the ratings.\n\n26:19.760 --> 26:20.760\n Yeah.\n\n26:20.760 --> 26:22.480\n But if you take, for example, Adderall or speed, right?\n\n26:22.480 --> 26:25.680\n People like you focus on things, you perceive things that aren't there.\n\n26:25.680 --> 26:27.800\n But that doesn't mean those things weren't there to begin with.\n\n26:27.800 --> 26:32.320\n There are absolutely ways to change human perception chemically, through glasses, through\n\n26:32.320 --> 26:33.760\n getting drunk.\n\n26:33.760 --> 26:37.200\n None of that changes the fact that the reality underneath it is real and is causing this\n\n26:37.200 --> 26:38.200\n effect.\n\n26:38.200 --> 26:39.200\n Absolutely.\n\n26:39.200 --> 26:40.200\n And it has a particular nature, right?\n\n26:40.200 --> 26:43.160\n And all it's doing is changing the focus, right?\n\n26:43.160 --> 26:45.400\n So if I take off my glasses, I'm seeing the same thing.\n\n26:45.400 --> 26:49.240\n I'm just seeing something's out of focus and maybe in the distance, I can't see something.\n\n26:49.240 --> 26:50.240\n It's just gone.\n\n26:50.240 --> 26:51.240\n And then I put it on.\n\n26:51.240 --> 26:52.240\n There it is.\n\n26:52.240 --> 26:53.380\n That thing was always there.\n\n26:53.380 --> 26:57.640\n It's just the sensitivity I have to it has changed.\n\n26:57.640 --> 27:00.720\n And it's absolutely not sensitive to everything equally.\n\n27:00.720 --> 27:03.800\n And drugs can change the relative sensitivities.\n\n27:03.800 --> 27:06.000\n It doesn't change reality.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:09.600\n It changes our ability to focus on reality.\n\n27:09.600 --> 27:13.400\n Let me give you one great example, the microscope.\n\n27:13.400 --> 27:14.400\n I forget who it was.\n\n27:14.400 --> 27:16.840\n His name was with an L, the scientist who discovered it.\n\n27:16.840 --> 27:21.380\n He had a drop of water and he's seeing monsters, the protozoa in this drop of water.\n\n27:21.380 --> 27:24.880\n For him, it must have been, it is like a drug experience, like, wait a minute, I'm drinking\n\n27:24.880 --> 27:25.880\n this.\n\n27:25.880 --> 27:29.280\n And there's alien beings whose shapes are completely crazy in this water.\n\n27:29.280 --> 27:30.500\n Those beings were always there.\n\n27:30.500 --> 27:32.000\n Those beings were there before any of us were here.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:33.800\n They've been there for billions of years.\n\n27:33.800 --> 27:37.780\n But because he had this apparatus, now he's able to see protozoa.\n\n27:37.780 --> 27:41.920\n No one's arguing protozoa are extradimensional, no one's arguing the supernatural, amoebas\n\n27:41.920 --> 27:44.360\n are well studied, paramecia, all the other lots.\n\n27:44.360 --> 27:49.000\n So if these elves, the machine elves are real, and the only way to perceive them is through\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:53.800\n DMT or something like that, that doesn't contradict the broader point that they've always been\n\n27:53.800 --> 27:56.360\n there and this is the mechanism for perceiving them.\n\n27:56.360 --> 27:59.920\n So here's the word I was looking for, it's the word actually Greg taught me this, so\n\n27:59.920 --> 28:02.000\n Greg Salamieri.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:03.940\n So it's resolution, right?\n\n28:03.940 --> 28:04.940\n So it's resolution.\n\n28:04.940 --> 28:06.680\n My resolution changes with the glasses.\n\n28:06.680 --> 28:09.600\n My resolution gets finer with the microscope.\n\n28:09.600 --> 28:11.920\n So there's probably some bacteria here on the table.\n\n28:11.920 --> 28:12.920\n 100%.\n\n28:12.920 --> 28:13.920\n Right?\n\n28:13.920 --> 28:14.920\n There's no doubt about it.\n\n28:14.920 --> 28:15.920\n I can't see them.\n\n28:15.920 --> 28:19.880\n I can't use the microscope to not see them, but they're either there or they're not there.\n\n28:19.880 --> 28:24.120\n And I have the tools to discover whether they are there or they're not there.\n\n28:24.120 --> 28:26.000\n And that's called a microscope.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:29.840\n Now there could be even smaller beings that even with a microscope, I won't be able to\n\n28:29.840 --> 28:34.240\n define, but that's completely arbitrary to claim that, that they're there until I find\n\n28:34.240 --> 28:36.040\n a tool to be able to discover it.\n\n28:36.040 --> 28:41.360\n The same with what you see if you're seeing other beings when you're taking psychedelics.\n\n28:41.360 --> 28:46.280\n Unless you find another tool to be able to see them with, the simplest assumption is\n\n28:46.280 --> 28:47.840\n probably the truest assumption.\n\n28:47.840 --> 28:50.440\n But even the not simplest assumption doesn't contradict the broader point.\n\n28:50.440 --> 28:51.440\n No.\n\n28:51.440 --> 28:52.440\n Which is again, reality is what it is.\n\n28:52.440 --> 28:56.160\n If it turns out that there are these creatures that you can only see with psychedelics, and\n\n28:56.160 --> 29:00.720\n there are these creatures that you can only see with psychedelics, and our resolution\n\n29:00.720 --> 29:04.500\n while we're not on psychedelics is not fine enough to observe them.\n\n29:04.500 --> 29:05.500\n So what?\n\n29:05.500 --> 29:10.960\n That doesn't change the fact that we evolved to survive in reality as it is.\n\n29:10.960 --> 29:14.720\n What do you do with the possibility that our resolution as it currently stands is really,\n\n29:14.720 --> 29:15.960\n really crappy?\n\n29:15.960 --> 29:16.960\n That basically.\n\n29:16.960 --> 29:17.960\n Well, it's not.\n\n29:17.960 --> 29:19.520\n No, but you don't know that.\n\n29:19.520 --> 29:20.520\n No, we know it.\n\n29:20.520 --> 29:21.520\n We know it completely.\n\n29:21.520 --> 29:22.520\n Compared to who?\n\n29:22.520 --> 29:23.520\n Exactly.\n\n29:23.520 --> 29:24.520\n Compared to the future possibilities like artificial intelligence.\n\n29:24.520 --> 29:25.520\n It is true.\n\n29:25.520 --> 29:26.520\n Hundreds of years.\n\n29:26.520 --> 29:27.520\n It is crappy compared to the future.\n\n29:27.520 --> 29:28.520\n That's true.\n\n29:28.520 --> 29:29.520\n Fine.\n\n29:29.520 --> 29:30.520\n But that's not relevant.\n\n29:30.520 --> 29:31.520\n Much, much.\n\n29:31.520 --> 29:32.520\n Yes.\n\n29:32.520 --> 29:33.520\n Or just the magnitude of crappy.\n\n29:33.520 --> 29:34.520\n Of course.\n\n29:34.520 --> 29:35.520\n No, but here I'll use the standard that Hoffman uses, evolution, right?\n\n29:35.520 --> 29:39.880\n The reason I know that our resolution is phenomenal, it's phenomenally good, right?\n\n29:39.880 --> 29:46.540\n Because look at us, we're sitting here comfortably in an apartment with air conditioning and\n\n29:46.540 --> 29:53.080\n in warm Austin with microphones and we did all this stuff, we're really good at survival\n\n29:53.080 --> 29:54.480\n and changing the environment.\n\n29:54.480 --> 29:59.600\n Indeed, if you look at the species that we know of, there's not a species that come anywhere\n\n29:59.600 --> 30:05.200\n close to our ability to deal with reality, to observe reality, to understand reality\n\n30:05.200 --> 30:06.200\n and to shape it.\n\n30:06.200 --> 30:09.760\n Now in the future, well, we'll come up with machines that can figure out stuff that we\n\n30:09.760 --> 30:12.680\n have no clue about today.\n\n30:12.680 --> 30:16.080\n That's only because we're so well suited to reality that can we create those machines.\n\n30:16.080 --> 30:20.480\n And I promise you, in the future, it's going to be much more what you're saying.\n\n30:20.480 --> 30:21.480\n That's how it's going to happen.\n\n30:21.480 --> 30:24.640\n No, but the thing is, when the creatures from the future look back to the things we're saying\n\n30:24.640 --> 30:28.080\n now, what Aydin Rand is saying, what you're saying with certainty, do you think they'll\n\n30:28.080 --> 30:32.480\n laugh at the level of how much confusion there was, how much inaccuracy?\n\n30:32.480 --> 30:33.480\n Did you?\n\n30:33.480 --> 30:34.480\n No.\n\n30:34.480 --> 30:35.480\n No, no.\n\n30:35.480 --> 30:36.480\n Let me get this one.\n\n30:36.480 --> 30:37.480\n You know what they're going to do?\n\n30:37.480 --> 30:38.480\n Yes.\n\n30:38.480 --> 30:42.280\n They're going to either read Aristotle or read any of these great geniuses of the past.\n\n30:42.280 --> 30:44.760\n It's like these people didn't have electricity.\n\n30:44.760 --> 30:49.680\n They didn't have warm clothes or anything, and they're able to figure out the diameter\n\n30:49.680 --> 30:50.680\n of the Earth.\n\n30:50.680 --> 30:55.060\n Like the creativity to be and to get it within a few miles.\n\n30:55.060 --> 30:59.420\n The creativity and to figure out the speed of light when you don't even have a stopwatch.\n\n30:59.420 --> 31:04.900\n When you look back, a lot of it's nonsense, but it's like when you're talking to a kid.\n\n31:04.900 --> 31:09.280\n They would disregard the nonsense, and when they get something right, it's awe.\n\n31:09.280 --> 31:11.320\n So it's never a numbers game, right?\n\n31:11.320 --> 31:16.600\n So it's the few that validate and justify the rest.\n\n31:16.600 --> 31:20.780\n So when you look at Aristotle, he's talking about there was one of those causes which\n\n31:20.780 --> 31:23.120\n is like time travel and it doesn't really make sense.\n\n31:23.120 --> 31:26.680\n But you look at the rest of this stuff or even Plato or any of these greats, it's like,\n\n31:26.680 --> 31:29.160\n oh my, this is an amazing miracle.\n\n31:29.160 --> 31:31.340\n I wouldn't say literally miracle, I got you, everyone.\n\n31:31.340 --> 31:34.300\n But at the same time, yeah, a lot of these other people had stupid ideas.\n\n31:34.300 --> 31:35.300\n You don't care.\n\n31:35.300 --> 31:39.860\n You care about those great, great minds and how they moved us all forward.\n\n31:39.860 --> 31:42.720\n To this day, we still study Pythagoras.\n\n31:42.720 --> 31:46.320\n And it's not even just the sciences and the math.\n\n31:46.320 --> 31:48.560\n Think about the philosophy.\n\n31:48.560 --> 31:52.520\n How much is there to learn from reading Aristotle or Plato or Socrates when you disagree with\n\n31:52.520 --> 31:53.520\n them?\n\n31:53.520 --> 31:58.220\n How many giants have there been in all of human history that have had the minds of Socrates\n\n31:58.220 --> 32:00.640\n or Plato and Aristotle?\n\n32:00.640 --> 32:04.760\n A thousand years where they look back at Plato and Aristotle and admire them?\n\n32:04.760 --> 32:05.760\n Absolutely.\n\n32:05.760 --> 32:10.960\n Well, they find certain things that are wrong, yes, but certain things that Aristotle discovered\n\n32:10.960 --> 32:14.240\n are absolutely right and will always be right.\n\n32:14.240 --> 32:16.680\n Certain things that Ayn Rand discovered will always be right.\n\n32:16.680 --> 32:21.440\n I think a lot of what she came up with, will some things be discovered to be wrong?\n\n32:21.440 --> 32:22.440\n Yeah.\n\n32:22.440 --> 32:25.200\n You know, that wouldn't shock me.\n\n32:25.200 --> 32:33.100\n But the genius and the truth that we know today is amazing.\n\n32:33.100 --> 32:38.600\n It's stunning to be pessimistic about us because in the future we'll know more.\n\n32:38.600 --> 32:40.160\n Not pessimistic, but more humble.\n\n32:40.160 --> 32:42.000\n There's no reason to be humble.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:45.760\n I mean, I really think humility is a vice, not a virtue.\n\n32:45.760 --> 32:46.760\n What's there to be humble about?\n\n32:46.760 --> 32:48.520\n Look at life.\n\n32:48.520 --> 32:49.520\n This is amazing.\n\n32:49.520 --> 32:51.120\n We should be...\n\n32:51.120 --> 32:52.120\n But the word humble has different meanings.\n\n32:52.120 --> 32:53.120\n I know.\n\n32:53.120 --> 32:54.120\n I know.\n\n32:54.120 --> 32:55.120\n Okay.\n\n32:55.120 --> 32:56.120\n I know what it's going to get.\n\n32:56.120 --> 33:07.880\n I mean, humility in a sense of not appreciating the genius and the ability and the success\n\n33:07.880 --> 33:15.240\n and all the stuff that we as individuals, I think, in our lives, but as a culture, as\n\n33:15.240 --> 33:18.760\n a movement, if you think about movement in terms of those of us who respect reason have\n\n33:18.760 --> 33:24.500\n achieved in spite of the odds, we should be proud of that and pride as the virtue.\n\n33:24.500 --> 33:27.560\n Humility in the sense of, yeah, I know there's more to know.\n\n33:27.560 --> 33:30.520\n I know there's a lot more to know and in the future we'll know more.\n\n33:30.520 --> 33:31.520\n Sure.\n\n33:31.520 --> 33:32.520\n But I don't think that's the way...\n\n33:32.520 --> 33:35.820\n See, I take humility as the way the Christians use it, which is the other way.\n\n33:35.820 --> 33:37.480\n And I think it's a real vice.\n\n33:37.480 --> 33:41.880\n It's don't think of yourself too much just because you can think that's no big deal or\n\n33:41.880 --> 33:43.280\n just because you can create this stuff.\n\n33:43.280 --> 33:44.920\n It is a big deal.\n\n33:44.920 --> 33:47.960\n Your achievements are a big deal and you should take credit for them.\n\n33:47.960 --> 33:52.280\n So be careful with the word humility because the real meaning is the Christian meaning,\n\n33:52.280 --> 33:54.800\n which is a very, very bad meaning.\n\n33:54.800 --> 33:55.800\n Hold on.\n\n33:55.800 --> 33:58.160\n Let me be a little pedantic because there's no such thing as real meaning, right?\n\n33:58.160 --> 33:59.160\n So there's different meanings.\n\n33:59.160 --> 34:00.160\n Okay.\n\n34:00.160 --> 34:01.160\n Hold on.\n\n34:01.160 --> 34:03.480\n This is semantics, but here's another real meaning that you're not going to disagree\n\n34:03.480 --> 34:09.440\n with, which is the smartest person on earth is ignorant of 99.9% of knowledge, right?\n\n34:09.440 --> 34:14.880\n So if I meet someone who is less intelligent than me and less informed than me, it is still\n\n34:14.880 --> 34:18.480\n certain that this person has things to teach me.\n\n34:18.480 --> 34:22.720\n If I go to a mechanic and maybe this guy's dumb as rocks.\n\n34:22.720 --> 34:24.440\n I don't know anything about cars.\n\n34:24.440 --> 34:26.040\n What he tells me about that car is good.\n\n34:26.040 --> 34:27.320\n I could take it to the bank.\n\n34:27.320 --> 34:29.520\n He's going to be in a position to inform me.\n\n34:29.520 --> 34:34.600\n So one of the reasons humility is extremely important is very often you have people and\n\n34:34.600 --> 34:39.360\n you see this very much in academia who think you know exactly where I'm going around who\n\n34:39.360 --> 34:43.180\n think they're know what else and they think, oh, I have this degree.\n\n34:43.180 --> 34:44.180\n You're a layman.\n\n34:44.180 --> 34:46.000\n You've never been formally educated.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:49.680\n Therefore not only you dumb and uneducated and you're wrong.\n\n34:49.680 --> 34:53.480\n And it's like this person might be have won a great example of this.\n\n34:53.480 --> 34:58.640\n And this is an example you might not like is a lot of times you have these native populations\n\n34:58.640 --> 35:02.680\n and they'll have a better understanding of the animals around them, the plants, the fruits,\n\n35:02.680 --> 35:03.680\n whatever.\n\n35:03.680 --> 35:06.200\n And you'd have these scientists and be like, oh, they're talking about this monster in\n\n35:06.200 --> 35:07.200\n the woods.\n\n35:07.200 --> 35:08.200\n Yeah, whatever.\n\n35:08.200 --> 35:09.200\n This giant, this giant ape.\n\n35:09.200 --> 35:10.200\n But it was real.\n\n35:10.200 --> 35:11.200\n It was the gorilla.\n\n35:11.200 --> 35:14.080\n But you know, you dismiss them because, oh, these are stupid, ignorant, whatever people\n\n35:14.080 --> 35:15.540\n that's kind of changed to some extent.\n\n35:15.540 --> 35:20.940\n But that is an aspect of humility that I think behooves especially highly intelligent people\n\n35:20.940 --> 35:25.200\n because there is such a presumption to be dismissive of people who you regard as less\n\n35:25.200 --> 35:26.200\n than.\n\n35:26.200 --> 35:27.200\n But they're often right.\n\n35:27.200 --> 35:28.200\n So I agree.\n\n35:28.200 --> 35:31.480\n I agree with all of the concrete examples.\n\n35:31.480 --> 35:34.020\n I just think we should come up with a better word than humility.\n\n35:34.020 --> 35:36.200\n And I don't have one because I'm not I'm not a woodsmith.\n\n35:36.200 --> 35:37.200\n I'm not.\n\n35:37.200 --> 35:38.820\n This is not my strength.\n\n35:38.820 --> 35:43.780\n But humility, humility is a is a word from the Christian ethics.\n\n35:43.780 --> 35:47.720\n And it means something very specific in the field of ethics.\n\n35:47.720 --> 35:54.200\n And it means the opposite of of what I think virtue requires.\n\n35:54.200 --> 35:55.200\n It's demeaning.\n\n35:55.200 --> 35:56.520\n It's to put you down.\n\n35:56.520 --> 36:00.240\n It's to it's to it's to resist pride.\n\n36:00.240 --> 36:01.800\n And I think pride is a very important thing.\n\n36:01.800 --> 36:02.800\n I don't know.\n\n36:02.800 --> 36:03.800\n You're on.\n\n36:03.800 --> 36:04.800\n But again, you have to define your terms properly.\n\n36:04.800 --> 36:09.560\n Hating myself has has been quite useful for me as well, but that's because you're Russian\n\n36:09.560 --> 36:10.560\n and Jewish.\n\n36:10.560 --> 36:17.000\n So by what this changes, you know, this is this is what happens, right?\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:22.800\n We're brought up to, you know, to to feel exactly that way in a good Russian boy.\n\n36:22.800 --> 36:23.800\n So we got him.\n\n36:23.800 --> 36:24.800\n Oh, my God.\n\n36:24.800 --> 36:25.800\n What is this?\n\n36:25.800 --> 36:26.800\n What is this?\n\n36:26.800 --> 36:27.800\n Gimmat again.\n\n36:27.800 --> 36:28.800\n What is this?\n\n36:28.800 --> 36:29.800\n Gimmat again.\n\n36:29.800 --> 36:30.800\n What is that?\n\n36:30.800 --> 36:31.800\n What it says?\n\n36:31.800 --> 36:32.800\n Yeah.\n\n36:32.800 --> 36:33.800\n Gimmat again.\n\n36:33.800 --> 36:34.800\n I can't.\n\n36:34.800 --> 36:35.800\n I can't.\n\n36:35.800 --> 36:36.800\n I'm blind.\n\n36:36.800 --> 36:37.800\n Yeah.\n\n36:37.800 --> 36:38.800\n But as long as you're good.\n\n36:38.800 --> 36:39.800\n But is it kosher?\n\n36:39.800 --> 36:40.800\n Yes, it is.\n\n36:40.800 --> 36:43.460\n Check if it's kosher.\n\n36:43.460 --> 36:44.720\n This is Ukrainian, my friend.\n\n36:44.720 --> 36:46.440\n Oh, oh, my God.\n\n36:46.440 --> 36:47.440\n That is a sin.\n\n36:47.440 --> 36:48.440\n How dare you?\n\n36:48.440 --> 36:49.440\n That is really simple.\n\n36:49.440 --> 36:50.920\n You know, me and Sinai were born in the same town.\n\n36:50.920 --> 36:51.920\n I'm kidding.\n\n36:51.920 --> 36:52.920\n My dad is Ukrainian.\n\n36:52.920 --> 36:53.920\n Don't get mad.\n\n36:53.920 --> 36:58.960\n So I don't think I don't think self self.\n\n36:58.960 --> 37:00.960\n What did you how did you define it?\n\n37:00.960 --> 37:01.960\n Self hate?\n\n37:01.960 --> 37:02.960\n Yeah.\n\n37:02.960 --> 37:05.960\n I think self hate is quite destructive.\n\n37:05.960 --> 37:06.960\n Speak for yourself.\n\n37:06.960 --> 37:10.400\n I think that humility is quite destructive.\n\n37:10.400 --> 37:12.960\n Humility in the sense of I'm no big deal.\n\n37:12.960 --> 37:13.960\n No.\n\n37:13.960 --> 37:15.860\n I mean, if you've achieved something in life, you are a big deal.\n\n37:15.860 --> 37:20.560\n You are a big deal because, you know, look, you got the two of us to fly into town just\n\n37:20.560 --> 37:22.400\n to sit down here and have a conversation with you.\n\n37:22.400 --> 37:23.400\n You're a big deal.\n\n37:23.400 --> 37:24.840\n That says more about you than me.\n\n37:24.840 --> 37:25.840\n We're just desperate.\n\n37:25.840 --> 37:26.840\n We're lonely and depraved.\n\n37:26.840 --> 37:27.840\n I'm not lonely.\n\n37:27.840 --> 37:33.720\n I might be desperate.\n\n37:33.720 --> 37:40.480\n I'm starting to question your ability to reason with the decisions you're making on the on\n\n37:40.480 --> 37:44.520\n the aspect of and I should mention that The Idiot by Dostoevsky is one of my favorite\n\n37:44.520 --> 37:47.800\n novels and there is a Christian ethic that runs through that.\n\n37:47.800 --> 37:52.860\n I mean, because because, yeah, I mean, particularly but I hate to bring this up, but particularly\n\n37:52.860 --> 37:57.880\n Russians and particularly Russian Jews and particularly Eastern European Jews are incredibly\n\n37:57.880 --> 37:58.880\n Christian.\n\n37:58.880 --> 38:06.480\n There's a there's a there's a real Christian theme in in Judaism that's that's about guilt.\n\n38:06.480 --> 38:09.600\n Guilt is not there's no guilt in Judaism.\n\n38:09.600 --> 38:11.200\n King David doesn't feel any guilt.\n\n38:11.200 --> 38:12.200\n Solomon doesn't.\n\n38:12.200 --> 38:13.960\n There's no guilt in the in the Old Testament.\n\n38:13.960 --> 38:15.300\n Plenty of guilt.\n\n38:15.300 --> 38:18.760\n Once Christianity has an impact on Judaism, we're raised to feel this way.\n\n38:18.760 --> 38:20.160\n We're raised to be humble.\n\n38:20.160 --> 38:22.000\n We're raised not to feel special.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:27.720\n We were raised to think we're no big deal and to and our mothers put us down and and\n\n38:27.720 --> 38:31.040\n use that against us and try to inflict guilt on us.\n\n38:31.040 --> 38:33.480\n They raise us up and then they knock us down.\n\n38:33.480 --> 38:36.640\n It's a mechanism, but it's it's a cultural mechanism.\n\n38:36.640 --> 38:39.240\n And I think it's very destructive to self esteem and to happiness.\n\n38:39.240 --> 38:42.120\n Let me and I'll give you a great he's absolutely right with what he just said.\n\n38:42.120 --> 38:43.120\n I disagree.\n\n38:43.120 --> 38:44.120\n Oh, yeah.\n\n38:44.120 --> 38:45.120\n Why?\n\n38:45.120 --> 38:46.120\n Why is he right?\n\n38:46.120 --> 38:48.700\n Because like my family, for example, it still doesn't really understand how I could pay\n\n38:48.700 --> 38:50.460\n the rent because I don't go into an office.\n\n38:50.460 --> 38:55.120\n And like when I started out trying to be a writer, the immediate reaction isn't which\n\n38:55.120 --> 38:58.840\n is a lot of times I talk to kids, right, and they have these aspirations.\n\n38:58.840 --> 39:02.040\n And I'll tell them, go for it while you're young.\n\n39:02.040 --> 39:05.880\n If you fail, you'll go to your grave with like I tried my best.\n\n39:05.880 --> 39:07.280\n I didn't make it happen.\n\n39:07.280 --> 39:11.000\n Whereas if you don't try and never achieve, you are going to feel horrible for the rest\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:12.000\n of your life.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:13.400\n And this is the example I use all the time.\n\n39:13.400 --> 39:19.320\n I bring up many times I go go to any bookstore and look at all those terrible, terrible books\n\n39:19.320 --> 39:22.280\n on the shelves that you wonder, how is this a book that could be you?\n\n39:22.280 --> 39:23.820\n You could be that crappy writer.\n\n39:23.820 --> 39:27.600\n But the thing is, in that culture that Yaron was talking about, you tell your family, I'm\n\n39:27.600 --> 39:28.600\n going to be a writer.\n\n39:28.600 --> 39:29.600\n Who do you think you are?\n\n39:29.600 --> 39:30.600\n Why do you think you're going to be?\n\n39:30.600 --> 39:31.600\n You're no Stephen King.\n\n39:31.600 --> 39:33.660\n And it's like, why do you have to be Stephen King?\n\n39:33.660 --> 39:37.360\n Why can't you just be a mediocre, crappy writer making the rent?\n\n39:37.360 --> 39:38.560\n The best that you can be.\n\n39:38.560 --> 39:39.840\n But even that is an amazing accomplishment.\n\n39:39.840 --> 39:40.840\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n39:40.840 --> 39:44.000\n If I don't have to go to an office and I write books that not that many people read, this\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:49.080\n is the story of my life, at the same time, I do have pride because I made this happen.\n\n39:49.080 --> 39:50.080\n You can be the best version.\n\n39:50.080 --> 39:53.280\n I mean, this is a cliche, but you can be the best version of yourself.\n\n39:53.280 --> 39:54.700\n It's not a competition.\n\n39:54.700 --> 39:59.280\n And yet our Jewish mothers, that's not what they aspire us to be.\n\n39:59.280 --> 40:04.640\n They aspire us to be the best version of what they imagine, what the culture imagines, what\n\n40:04.640 --> 40:09.640\n society imagined, not what, it's not about you in their minds.\n\n40:09.640 --> 40:12.800\n And I've seen it, I see it all around me.\n\n40:12.800 --> 40:15.700\n People putting their kids down, putting themselves down.\n\n40:15.700 --> 40:16.700\n It's not healthy.\n\n40:16.700 --> 40:19.080\n I've never told this story, I'm going to tell it now.\n\n40:19.080 --> 40:24.160\n When I graduated college, I was a temp for a while because I didn't know what I wanted\n\n40:24.160 --> 40:25.160\n to do.\n\n40:25.160 --> 40:26.160\n Right?\n\n40:26.160 --> 40:27.160\n And when you're a temp, it's like playing roulette.\n\n40:27.160 --> 40:31.480\n You're going to have jobs that pay well, that suck, and pay well that are great or that\n\n40:31.480 --> 40:35.020\n are great that don't pay well and suck and pay poorly.\n\n40:35.020 --> 40:38.560\n But it's you and you're 21, you have that kind of space.\n\n40:38.560 --> 40:43.160\n And my grandmother was talking to her brother, you know, he's talking about his kids, she's\n\n40:43.160 --> 40:45.820\n talking about me, she's, you know, from Odessa.\n\n40:45.820 --> 40:50.740\n And she told me she lied to him about how much money I was making.\n\n40:50.740 --> 40:54.000\n And that's something I've never brought up and it still hurts me.\n\n40:54.000 --> 41:02.560\n Because it's like, your approval of me should be a function of my character, my happiness.\n\n41:02.560 --> 41:06.920\n And the fact that you feel ashamed over how much money I'm making, especially at this\n\n41:06.920 --> 41:11.560\n point in my life, I thought was very, really misplaced priorities.\n\n41:11.560 --> 41:12.560\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n41:12.560 --> 41:13.560\n I don't know.\n\n41:13.560 --> 41:15.400\n I don't know what to make of that.\n\n41:15.400 --> 41:23.160\n I think there's a huge benefit to the humility, terms aside, for believing that others can\n\n41:23.160 --> 41:24.160\n teach you a lot.\n\n41:24.160 --> 41:25.160\n Everybody, everybody can teach you a lot.\n\n41:25.160 --> 41:26.160\n I think we all agree on that.\n\n41:26.160 --> 41:27.160\n I just mentioned that, the mechanic.\n\n41:27.160 --> 41:28.160\n No, you do.\n\n41:28.160 --> 41:29.160\n Exactly.\n\n41:29.160 --> 41:30.160\n Exactly the point.\n\n41:30.160 --> 41:37.760\n But for that, I do believe you have to not constantly sort of break your ego apart and\n\n41:37.760 --> 41:43.880\n constantly question whether you know anything about this world and sort of there's a negativity\n\n41:43.880 --> 41:46.800\n with it that I think is very useful.\n\n41:46.800 --> 41:50.920\n And it's also very fulfilling, just constantly.\n\n41:50.920 --> 41:51.920\n I don't know.\n\n41:51.920 --> 41:52.920\n It's the other way around.\n\n41:52.920 --> 41:58.340\n I find that the more, the more I know, the more I know I know, the easier it is for me\n\n41:58.340 --> 42:00.360\n to learn from other people.\n\n42:00.360 --> 42:06.600\n The broader a context I have, the more curious I become, the more areas I know.\n\n42:06.600 --> 42:10.440\n You know, it's true that the more you know, the more areas you know you don't know.\n\n42:10.440 --> 42:14.680\n And the more I find myself attracted to people who can teach me something about things I\n\n42:14.680 --> 42:15.680\n don't know.\n\n42:15.680 --> 42:21.520\n Whereas if I was ignorant, if I truly believed I didn't know anything, I don't know how I\n\n42:21.520 --> 42:22.520\n would live.\n\n42:22.520 --> 42:28.640\n It would really completely challenge everything, everything about life for me.\n\n42:28.640 --> 42:29.740\n Where would I even start?\n\n42:29.740 --> 42:31.000\n You wouldn't know where to start.\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:36.200\n So no, I think, and if you don't recognize what you know, you don't have a full appreciation\n\n42:36.200 --> 42:37.700\n of yourself.\n\n42:37.700 --> 42:41.680\n So really building a recognition of what do I know, right?\n\n42:41.680 --> 42:45.640\n And how much do I know is really crucial to living.\n\n42:45.640 --> 42:49.840\n And I'll tell you something else that furthers my life enormously is when you reach a certain\n\n42:49.840 --> 42:53.480\n point in your career in your life, and you're talking to people who are a lot younger, and\n\n42:53.480 --> 42:57.160\n they might be smart, driven, intelligent, they lack data.\n\n42:57.160 --> 43:00.080\n When you're 23, you don't know how to speak corporate, you don't know what the code words\n\n43:00.080 --> 43:01.080\n are.\n\n43:01.080 --> 43:05.400\n So if I am in a position to sit down with this kid and be like, do X, Y, and Z, and\n\n43:05.400 --> 43:06.940\n here's why I'm coming to this conclusion.\n\n43:06.940 --> 43:09.740\n This is the information that released me this conclusion.\n\n43:09.740 --> 43:13.560\n And I can save them from some of the suffering I went through.\n\n43:13.560 --> 43:15.600\n That is very gratifying.\n\n43:15.600 --> 43:17.480\n It's making the world a better place.\n\n43:17.480 --> 43:22.160\n And it's also the opposite in a sense of humility, because like, in this context, I'm an expert,\n\n43:22.160 --> 43:25.000\n or at least knowledgeable enough that I'm comfortable giving you advice.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:26.000\n Yeah.\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:29.840\n And look, everything I do is about me knowing stuff that other people don't.\n\n43:29.840 --> 43:32.860\n And I know a lot of stuff other people don't, and I do.\n\n43:32.860 --> 43:34.400\n And it's fun.\n\n43:34.400 --> 43:35.400\n I'm a teacher.\n\n43:35.400 --> 43:36.640\n I'm a teacher at heart, always have been.\n\n43:36.640 --> 43:42.400\n It turns out, I didn't know that early on, but I like becoming an expert and then trying\n\n43:42.400 --> 43:43.400\n to teach people.\n\n43:43.400 --> 43:45.100\n It doesn't mean I know everything.\n\n43:45.100 --> 43:46.100\n Quite the contrary.\n\n43:46.100 --> 43:49.480\n Again, the more I know, the more I know that the certain things I don't know and the certain\n\n43:49.480 --> 43:51.360\n areas of expertise I don't have.\n\n43:51.360 --> 43:54.080\n But look, pride is a broader concept than that.\n\n43:54.080 --> 43:57.440\n Pride is about, and humility is the opposite of pride.\n\n43:57.440 --> 43:59.040\n And Christianity has that right.\n\n43:59.040 --> 44:01.220\n Pride is about taking your life seriously.\n\n44:01.220 --> 44:07.800\n Pride is about wanting to be really good at living, wanting to have the knowledge.\n\n44:07.800 --> 44:12.880\n And I think what you're describing is, you're describing as I'm constantly learning.\n\n44:12.880 --> 44:16.840\n Sometimes I have to challenge myself, I have to question what I believe in order to gain\n\n44:16.840 --> 44:17.840\n new knowledge.\n\n44:17.840 --> 44:23.160\n That's all good, but that is a drive that is driven by pride.\n\n44:23.160 --> 44:24.160\n You want to know.\n\n44:24.160 --> 44:28.800\n There are lots of people out there that don't want to know, because they don't have that\n\n44:28.800 --> 44:29.800\n pride.\n\n44:29.800 --> 44:34.200\n They don't have that commitment to live, the commitment to achieving something.\n\n44:34.200 --> 44:36.720\n And I'm going to say something else that I think is crucial.\n\n44:36.720 --> 44:40.480\n Humility is extremely important when it comes to politics.\n\n44:40.480 --> 44:46.240\n Because if you feel comfortable telling someone you've never met how to live their life, that\n\n44:46.240 --> 44:48.800\n is a complete lack of humility.\n\n44:48.800 --> 44:51.240\n I lack it, obviously, because I tell people how to live all the time.\n\n44:51.240 --> 44:52.240\n Not through force.\n\n44:52.240 --> 44:53.240\n Not through force.\n\n44:53.240 --> 44:54.240\n That's what I'm saying.\n\n44:54.240 --> 44:55.240\n And of course, not in the concrete.\n\n44:55.240 --> 44:59.200\n I don't tell them, you know, move to, although I do tell them to move to Austin, but I don't\n\n44:59.200 --> 45:01.800\n tell them this is what you do as a profession.\n\n45:01.800 --> 45:03.800\n But I give them the principles, because I think they're principles of how to live.\n\n45:03.800 --> 45:04.800\n They're making the choice.\n\n45:04.800 --> 45:05.800\n That's my point.\n\n45:05.800 --> 45:09.880\n Politically, what I'm saying is it shows a lack of humility to be like, I've never met\n\n45:09.880 --> 45:10.960\n this person.\n\n45:10.960 --> 45:12.960\n This is how I'm going to take money from him.\n\n45:12.960 --> 45:13.960\n I'm going to...\n\n45:13.960 --> 45:14.960\n See, but I don't see that humility.\n\n45:14.960 --> 45:15.960\n There's nothing...\n\n45:15.960 --> 45:16.960\n No, it's the lack of humility.\n\n45:16.960 --> 45:19.680\n No, but it's not even a lack of humility, because it's...\n\n45:19.680 --> 45:21.040\n Who am I to tell them how to live?\n\n45:21.040 --> 45:22.040\n That's lack of humility.\n\n45:22.040 --> 45:23.040\n No, of course you're not.\n\n45:23.040 --> 45:26.400\n No, who are you to tell them how to live is an issue of...\n\n45:26.400 --> 45:30.720\n It's an issue of force and rights and a bunch of different things.\n\n45:30.720 --> 45:32.880\n I don't think it's a lack of humility there.\n\n45:32.880 --> 45:34.960\n I think it's a lack of being a human being.\n\n45:34.960 --> 45:37.160\n It can be both.\n\n45:37.160 --> 45:38.160\n Sure.\n\n45:38.160 --> 45:43.080\n I think it's, who gives you the right to dictate to somebody else how to live their lives?\n\n45:43.080 --> 45:46.120\n Yeah, but that's a lack of humility, if you think you have that right.\n\n45:46.120 --> 45:49.000\n Again, we're using humility in a very different way.\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:53.240\n No, we're using the same way, because the person who feels comfortable, they think,\n\n45:53.240 --> 45:58.680\n I know better than you how you should live your life to the point where I'm a couple\n\n45:58.680 --> 46:01.520\n forcing you, because I know it's gonna be best for you in the long run.\n\n46:01.520 --> 46:02.760\n And the answer is you don't know.\n\n46:02.760 --> 46:04.600\n Right, but that's a lack of humility.\n\n46:04.600 --> 46:09.360\n I think in your mind, you're on humility somehow tied to the Christian concept, the humility,\n\n46:09.360 --> 46:11.240\n and so you're kind of allergic to the word.\n\n46:11.240 --> 46:12.680\n Well, absolutely, because it's part of...\n\n46:12.680 --> 46:19.200\n If you look at the cardinal virtues, the cardinal sins in Christianity, pride is a cardinal\n\n46:19.200 --> 46:25.640\n sin and humility is a cardinal virtue, but they don't mean it in the sense, because they're\n\n46:25.640 --> 46:27.720\n happy to tell you how to live, right?\n\n46:27.720 --> 46:31.760\n They're happy to be philosopher kings over your life, and they believe that's being humble.\n\n46:31.760 --> 46:35.960\n And you should be humble, by the way, in listening to the Pope or listening to God, because what\n\n46:35.960 --> 46:36.960\n do you know?\n\n46:36.960 --> 46:37.960\n You know nothing.\n\n46:37.960 --> 46:41.720\n God knows everything, so you should shut up and do what you're told.\n\n46:41.720 --> 46:43.920\n That's the sense in which I don't think you should be humble.\n\n46:43.920 --> 46:48.080\n I mean, it's a sense in which I always use the example of Abraham, right?\n\n46:48.080 --> 46:53.000\n God comes to Abraham and says, go kill your oldest son, your only son, right?\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:54.000\n Your only son.\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:55.000\n Go kill him.\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:56.000\n It's like...\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:57.000\n And what does Abraham do?\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:58.000\n He says, yes, sir.\n\n46:58.000 --> 46:59.000\n I'll follow...\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:04.080\n And he's a moral hero, for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, he's a moral hero, because he follows\n\n47:04.080 --> 47:06.120\n orders, because he's humble.\n\n47:06.120 --> 47:09.160\n I would tell God to go to hell.\n\n47:09.160 --> 47:10.160\n Screw you.\n\n47:10.160 --> 47:11.160\n I'm not killing my son.\n\n47:11.160 --> 47:12.160\n There's no way.\n\n47:12.160 --> 47:13.160\n But he killed...\n\n47:13.160 --> 47:14.160\n I mean, he killed his son, so it's only fair.\n\n47:14.160 --> 47:17.560\n Well, this is before he killed his son, so I didn't know that, right?\n\n47:17.560 --> 47:21.680\n No, but part of the evil, part of the evil of Christianity is that he's killed his son\n\n47:21.680 --> 47:25.440\n in the most torturous form of death possible.\n\n47:25.440 --> 47:30.400\n I mean, the whole story of Jesus is one of the most immoral, unjust stories ever told,\n\n47:30.400 --> 47:33.080\n and that Christians elevate this to a position of...\n\n47:33.080 --> 47:35.160\n I'd love to have this conversation with Jordan, right?\n\n47:35.160 --> 47:36.160\n Jordan Peterson.\n\n47:36.160 --> 47:37.160\n The idea of elevating...\n\n47:37.160 --> 47:38.160\n That'll never happen.\n\n47:38.160 --> 47:39.160\n No, it won't.\n\n47:39.160 --> 47:43.760\n But elevating Jesus, exactly, elevating Jesus to a superhero status for one of the most\n\n47:43.760 --> 47:47.320\n immoral acts in human history is horrific.\n\n47:47.320 --> 47:52.560\n So yeah, I mean, I'm opposed to God sacrificing his own son, never mind my son, but let him\n\n47:52.560 --> 47:53.560\n go do it to his own son.\n\n47:53.560 --> 47:54.560\n But he didn't kill Isaac.\n\n47:54.560 --> 47:55.560\n He killed the goat.\n\n47:55.560 --> 47:57.640\n The story's about Abraham, not about God.\n\n47:57.640 --> 48:01.560\n First of all, God is mean, right, to put Abraham through that.\n\n48:01.560 --> 48:06.300\n But Abraham has to assume that he's going to kill his son, and he lifts his...\n\n48:06.300 --> 48:08.920\n He's going to do it, and he stopped.\n\n48:08.920 --> 48:10.980\n So the whole point is obedience.\n\n48:10.980 --> 48:12.680\n That's what humility leads to.\n\n48:12.680 --> 48:14.940\n It leads to the opposite of the story you were telling.\n\n48:14.940 --> 48:17.440\n It leads to people saying, yes, I should be told what to do.\n\n48:17.440 --> 48:19.680\n Where's the authority who actually knows something?\n\n48:19.680 --> 48:20.840\n I don't know anything.\n\n48:20.840 --> 48:23.760\n No, I know a lot, and I know a lot about my life.\n\n48:23.760 --> 48:24.760\n The science...\n\n48:24.760 --> 48:27.200\n So you stay away from my life because I have pride in my life.\n\n48:27.200 --> 48:28.920\n The science is settled, right?\n\n48:28.920 --> 48:29.920\n Look at these experts.\n\n48:29.920 --> 48:31.100\n Who am I to argue with these experts?\n\n48:31.100 --> 48:32.800\n They tell me to drink dog pee.\n\n48:32.800 --> 48:33.800\n I'm going to drink...\n\n48:33.800 --> 48:34.800\n What am I, not drink dog pee?\n\n48:34.800 --> 48:35.800\n Yes.\n\n48:35.800 --> 48:36.800\n Yeah.\n\n48:36.800 --> 48:37.800\n Let's go back to the island.\n\n48:37.800 --> 48:38.800\n Speaking of which...\n\n48:38.800 --> 48:39.800\n We're on an island again?\n\n48:39.800 --> 48:40.800\n We're back to the island.\n\n48:40.800 --> 48:41.800\n Manhattan.\n\n48:41.800 --> 48:43.640\n And let's go to the island.\n\n48:43.640 --> 48:44.640\n Let's...\n\n48:44.640 --> 48:47.080\n I live on an island.\n\n48:47.080 --> 48:49.760\n Everything is an island in some context.\n\n48:49.760 --> 48:51.640\n Like Earth is an island.\n\n48:51.640 --> 48:54.040\n This universe is an island in a multiverse.\n\n48:54.040 --> 48:55.440\n There's no multiverses.\n\n48:55.440 --> 48:57.160\n There's only one universe.\n\n48:57.160 --> 48:58.160\n All right.\n\n48:58.160 --> 49:01.520\n So let's invite Jordan Peterson to this island.\n\n49:01.520 --> 49:02.520\n You wish.\n\n49:02.520 --> 49:03.520\n Hold on.\n\n49:03.520 --> 49:04.520\n Hold on a sec.\n\n49:04.520 --> 49:05.520\n Hey, girl.\n\n49:05.520 --> 49:06.520\n Whatcha doing?\n\n49:06.520 --> 49:07.520\n Lex.\n\n49:07.520 --> 49:08.520\n Lex Friedman?\n\n49:08.520 --> 49:09.520\n Look him up.\n\n49:09.520 --> 49:10.520\n Lex who?\n\n49:10.520 --> 49:11.520\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n49:11.520 --> 49:12.520\n I don't know.\n\n49:12.520 --> 49:13.520\n Lex who?\n\n49:13.520 --> 49:18.480\n I don't know, Lex says something as big of a following almost as Jordan does.\n\n49:18.480 --> 49:19.480\n I know Jordan.\n\n49:19.480 --> 49:22.840\n I know his family actually through Jim Keller, who's his relative.\n\n49:22.840 --> 49:23.840\n He's an engineer.\n\n49:23.840 --> 49:32.840\n And I just talked to Sam, who is perhaps a little bit aligned in some sense on your perspective\n\n49:32.840 --> 49:34.560\n on religion and so on.\n\n49:34.560 --> 49:35.880\n So let me ask, is there some...\n\n49:35.880 --> 49:36.880\n Religion, yes.\n\n49:36.880 --> 49:37.880\n But...\n\n49:37.880 --> 49:38.880\n Other things, no.\n\n49:38.880 --> 49:39.880\n Sam Harris.\n\n49:39.880 --> 49:40.880\n Sam Harris, yeah.\n\n49:40.880 --> 49:41.880\n Oh, sorry.\n\n49:41.880 --> 49:42.880\n Sam Harris.\n\n49:42.880 --> 49:43.880\n I thought you were talking about baseball.\n\n49:43.880 --> 49:44.880\n Yeah.\n\n49:44.880 --> 49:45.880\n I just talked to Sam.\n\n49:45.880 --> 49:46.880\n I thought...\n\n49:46.880 --> 49:47.880\n Let's talk about humility.\n\n49:47.880 --> 49:48.880\n Let's talk about humility, Lex.\n\n49:48.880 --> 49:49.880\n My buddy Sam.\n\n49:49.880 --> 49:50.880\n I was talking to Barack.\n\n49:50.880 --> 49:51.880\n You might know him.\n\n49:51.880 --> 49:52.880\n Yeah.\n\n49:52.880 --> 49:53.880\n I simply...\n\n49:53.880 --> 49:55.880\n Humility went out the window.\n\n49:55.880 --> 50:02.480\n I'm just a natural language processing model that I assume that once I mentioned Jordan\n\n50:02.480 --> 50:06.120\n Peterson, it becomes an obvious statement what Sam means.\n\n50:06.120 --> 50:07.680\n This is how neural networks think.\n\n50:07.680 --> 50:11.280\n This is how robots think, Michael, you should know this.\n\n50:11.280 --> 50:13.280\n I thought by now you'd be a scholar.\n\n50:13.280 --> 50:17.600\n For the sake of the audience.\n\n50:17.600 --> 50:18.720\n Humility.\n\n50:18.720 --> 50:21.800\n Everything can teach you something, even the robot.\n\n50:21.800 --> 50:22.800\n Okay.\n\n50:22.800 --> 50:28.000\n So do you think there's value in religion or broader?\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:30.080\n Do you think there's value in myth?\n\n50:30.080 --> 50:33.900\n And as we've been talking about the value of reason, do you think it's possible to argue\n\n50:33.900 --> 50:40.600\n in society as we grow the population of our little island that there's some value of common\n\n50:40.600 --> 50:43.680\n myths, of common stories, of common religion?\n\n50:43.680 --> 50:45.680\n There was value.\n\n50:45.680 --> 50:47.720\n There is no value today.\n\n50:47.720 --> 50:50.940\n So human beings need explanations, right?\n\n50:50.940 --> 50:53.240\n They need a philosophy to guide their life.\n\n50:53.240 --> 50:54.240\n They need ethics.\n\n50:54.240 --> 50:58.160\n They need some explanation of what's going on in the world, right?\n\n50:58.160 --> 51:04.440\n And it's no accident that the early religions had a river god and they had a sun god and\n\n51:04.440 --> 51:09.780\n a moon god because everything they didn't understand, they made god, right?\n\n51:09.780 --> 51:13.040\n So they had multiple gods because they didn't understand very much.\n\n51:13.040 --> 51:19.080\n As human understanding evolved, it increased, as we knew reality more, right?\n\n51:19.080 --> 51:22.700\n We came to the conclusion of, you know, this is very inefficient to have all these gods.\n\n51:22.700 --> 51:24.880\n This is a genius of Judaism, right?\n\n51:24.880 --> 51:28.320\n Let's just have one bucket to put all the stuff we don't know in and we'll call it one\n\n51:28.320 --> 51:32.820\n god and then we don't, as we gain new knowledge, we can just take it out of the bucket that's\n\n51:32.820 --> 51:36.440\n god and put it into the bucket of science.\n\n51:36.440 --> 51:42.160\n At some point, though, at some point, and that point suddenly came during the scientific\n\n51:42.160 --> 51:47.880\n revolution, I think, we could come to the conclusion that, no, we don't need this bucket\n\n51:47.880 --> 51:51.080\n that's called god to explain the things that we don't know.\n\n51:51.080 --> 51:55.920\n We can say we don't know and we're learning.\n\n51:55.920 --> 52:00.560\n And slowly our knowledge is increasing and yet there's a lot more that we don't know,\n\n52:00.560 --> 52:05.860\n but we don't need to throw it into some bucket that's called god in order to have it.\n\n52:05.860 --> 52:09.560\n And I think that's true for morality and it's true for everything else, right?\n\n52:09.560 --> 52:15.340\n As we gain the tools to understand what morality requires, we don't need a set of commandments.\n\n52:15.340 --> 52:19.400\n We can figure out morality from human nature and from reality.\n\n52:19.400 --> 52:22.560\n So I don't think we need religion anymore.\n\n52:22.560 --> 52:29.480\n I think religion needed to die probably about 200 years ago and was dying, I think, up until\n\n52:29.480 --> 52:30.480\n Kant.\n\n52:30.480 --> 52:31.480\n It seemed to be dying.\n\n52:31.480 --> 52:37.240\n Kant's missions, as he says, is to revive religion against attack of reason in the Enlightenment.\n\n52:37.240 --> 52:41.360\n Now mythology is a little different because it depends what you mean by mythology.\n\n52:41.360 --> 52:45.120\n Certainly we need stories and certainly we need art.\n\n52:45.120 --> 52:46.120\n Art is a...\n\n52:46.120 --> 52:50.400\n And Rand writes about this a lot and she's an artist and she writes in...\n\n52:50.400 --> 52:54.600\n I'm a huge fan of the Romantic Manifesto, which I think is one of her underappreciated\n\n52:54.600 --> 52:55.600\n masterpieces.\n\n52:55.600 --> 52:56.600\n Oh, I hate it.\n\n52:56.600 --> 52:57.600\n Okay.\n\n52:57.600 --> 52:58.600\n That's it.\n\n52:58.600 --> 52:59.600\n Okay.\n\n52:59.600 --> 53:03.520\n So I think we have a real need, right?\n\n53:03.520 --> 53:07.720\n As a conceptual being, we have a need for aesthetic experiences.\n\n53:07.720 --> 53:13.560\n We have a need to concretize abstractions, to concretize abstract ideas, to concretize\n\n53:13.560 --> 53:15.400\n the complex nature of the world out there.\n\n53:15.400 --> 53:20.520\n And that's what painting sculpture, to an extent music, but painting sculpture literature\n\n53:20.520 --> 53:22.200\n does for us.\n\n53:22.200 --> 53:27.120\n So to the extent that mythology serves that purpose, it's just art, right?\n\n53:27.120 --> 53:31.840\n To the extent that it serves another purpose, that is that it's a way for the gods to communicate\n\n53:31.840 --> 53:37.000\n with us or it fits some kind of preexisting mental construct that we have as, again, kind\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:38.720\n of a conscientious perspective, right?\n\n53:38.720 --> 53:45.520\n That we have these categorical imperatives and this mythology links up to that.\n\n53:45.520 --> 53:50.320\n Then I think it's false, it's not helpful and destructive.\n\n53:50.320 --> 53:54.080\n So I believe religion today is a destructive force on planet Earth.\n\n53:54.080 --> 53:55.980\n I think it's always been a destructive force.\n\n53:55.980 --> 53:57.640\n It was just a necessary force, right?\n\n53:57.640 --> 53:59.280\n You needed an explanation.\n\n53:59.280 --> 54:01.340\n People needed something to believe in.\n\n54:01.340 --> 54:05.920\n Once you get philosophy and once you get philosophy that starts explaining real life, real world,\n\n54:05.920 --> 54:09.120\n you don't need religion anymore and indeed it becomes a destructive force.\n\n54:09.120 --> 54:12.760\n And you look around the world today, it's an unbelievably destructive force.\n\n54:12.760 --> 54:16.560\n Everywhere it touches is bad for life.\n\n54:16.560 --> 54:21.040\n Again, mythology depends, art is essential, very, very crucial to human existence.\n\n54:21.040 --> 54:26.160\n I mean, I'd love to hear what you think, but you don't see religion and philosophy and\n\n54:26.160 --> 54:28.960\n mythology as just a continuous spectrum?\n\n54:28.960 --> 54:29.960\n Yeah.\n\n54:29.960 --> 54:30.960\n So religion is a primitive form of philosophy.\n\n54:30.960 --> 54:31.960\n It's prephilosophical.\n\n54:31.960 --> 54:39.760\n Where I thought Rand was going to go and he didn't go was that I think he, I agree with\n\n54:39.760 --> 54:43.720\n what he's going to say, Rand was a mythologizer.\n\n54:43.720 --> 54:46.340\n In certain specific contexts Atlas Shrugged is a myth.\n\n54:46.340 --> 54:50.500\n It's one thing to sit down and say, these are the people who move us forward.\n\n54:50.500 --> 54:52.600\n These are the values that are important.\n\n54:52.600 --> 54:57.920\n When you experience it through a story, through a movie, through a TV show, a poem or a painting,\n\n54:57.920 --> 55:02.200\n it affects you in a very visceral, very different way.\n\n55:02.200 --> 55:03.520\n Talk about American history.\n\n55:03.520 --> 55:06.640\n You have the founding fathers, then you have the myth of the founding fathers.\n\n55:06.640 --> 55:13.000\n Now, unfortunately the term myth often means lie, but it could mean in a useful sense,\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:17.480\n an abstraction to help you systematize and concretize ideas.\n\n55:17.480 --> 55:22.200\n So you have the myth of Reagan, you have the myth of Thatcher, the reality often falls\n\n55:22.200 --> 55:23.500\n very short.\n\n55:23.500 --> 55:29.680\n But when you look at how these different figures are mythologized, not only is it very inspirational\n\n55:29.680 --> 55:35.680\n on a personal level, very motivating on a personal level, it's also a great way to concretize\n\n55:35.680 --> 55:39.960\n ideas because just how humans think, it's one thing to think about ideas, but when you\n\n55:39.960 --> 55:44.240\n see someone who embodies these ideas, Miss America, I was saying earlier, I had an aster\n\n55:44.240 --> 55:47.060\n on my show, these people might be jerks.\n\n55:47.060 --> 55:51.040\n But when you look at them, one specific aspect of their life and you extrapolate it, that\n\n55:51.040 --> 55:53.260\n could be to anyone very motivating.\n\n55:53.260 --> 55:59.120\n And it's very important for people to have the belief that happiness and achievement\n\n55:59.120 --> 56:03.480\n is possible because it's very hard to keep that in mind, especially if you're depressed,\n\n56:03.480 --> 56:06.400\n if you're anxious, you're unemployed, you don't have a girlfriend, you think it's going\n\n56:06.400 --> 56:07.560\n to be like this forever.\n\n56:07.560 --> 56:11.200\n And then you look at someone's story and they're like, you know what, that astronaut interview,\n\n56:11.200 --> 56:17.000\n Clayton Anderson, he applied 13 times, didn't get a call back, applied the 14th time, got\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:19.280\n a call back, didn't get the job, 15th time he get the job.\n\n56:19.280 --> 56:25.160\n He talks to kids and he goes, listen, apply 13 times.\n\n56:25.160 --> 56:28.680\n Even if you don't get the call back, you'll still feel I'm doing something.\n\n56:28.680 --> 56:33.600\n And having heard him and the myth of Clayton Anderson, this is going to tell people, yeah,\n\n56:33.600 --> 56:34.600\n you know what?\n\n56:34.600 --> 56:35.600\n That could be me.\n\n56:35.600 --> 56:36.600\n Absolutely.\n\n56:36.600 --> 56:42.440\n And it's not just happiness, it's the fact that virtue works, that the integrity, I mean,\n\n56:42.440 --> 56:43.440\n what's the power of the fountainhead?\n\n56:43.440 --> 56:44.440\n I know you love the fountainhead.\n\n56:44.440 --> 56:51.920\n Part of the power of the fountainhead is how it works, absolute commitment to integrity.\n\n56:51.920 --> 56:55.860\n He is committed to integrity and he's happy.\n\n56:55.860 --> 57:02.820\n And it's very rare in life to see that, to actually see a concrete of that.\n\n57:02.820 --> 57:05.120\n And it's very hard to hold it in your mind.\n\n57:05.120 --> 57:09.320\n Yes, I'm going to be stuck in the quarry or I'm going to be stuck doing this horrible\n\n57:09.320 --> 57:10.320\n job.\n\n57:10.320 --> 57:12.920\n But if I stick to my principles, I'm going to be how it works.\n\n57:12.920 --> 57:13.920\n Now I've got that concrete.\n\n57:13.920 --> 57:18.660\n I know I can immediately relate to that success.\n\n57:18.660 --> 57:21.140\n So I think art is essential.\n\n57:21.140 --> 57:24.760\n And I think in a sense, what we do to Thatcher and Reagan is art.\n\n57:24.760 --> 57:29.980\n You have to be careful in true stories, not to diverge too far from reality because then\n\n57:29.980 --> 57:33.240\n when you discover the reality, you don't want to whitewash it, and particularly when it\n\n57:33.240 --> 57:35.920\n has political implications and then it's really bad.\n\n57:35.920 --> 57:39.120\n So particularly with Reagan and Thatcher, you have to be careful because they want anyone\n\n57:39.120 --> 57:41.920\n near as good as people try to make them out to be.\n\n57:41.920 --> 57:47.960\n But these are powerful, powerful, powerful stories and people are moved by it.\n\n57:47.960 --> 57:51.920\n And the integration of emotion with reason is crucial.\n\n57:51.920 --> 57:57.720\n One of the goals to be happy is to bring your emotions in line with your thinking.\n\n57:57.720 --> 58:03.120\n And I think that stories and arts more broadly, and when I go and see Michelangelo's David,\n\n58:03.120 --> 58:05.780\n it does the same thing to me.\n\n58:05.780 --> 58:08.600\n I can stand up to anybody because he did.\n\n58:08.600 --> 58:10.980\n And look, he succeeded.\n\n58:10.980 --> 58:13.000\n And it makes sense that he could.\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:18.000\n So this is a really interesting idea of bringing your emotion in line with your thinking, with\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:19.120\n your reasoning.\n\n58:19.120 --> 58:23.520\n So Ben Shapiro famously has this saying, how do you like that transition, Michael?\n\n58:23.520 --> 58:24.520\n Give me props.\n\n58:24.520 --> 58:25.520\n I know you do.\n\n58:25.520 --> 58:26.520\n He's not Ben, it's Ben Shapiro.\n\n58:26.520 --> 58:27.520\n Yeah.\n\n58:27.520 --> 58:28.520\n Someone is not taking your calls.\n\n58:28.520 --> 58:29.520\n Benny.\n\n58:29.520 --> 58:35.840\n I guess it's a daily, don't take the caller.\n\n58:35.840 --> 58:37.680\n Back to the island with the murder.\n\n58:37.680 --> 58:38.680\n I think we know.\n\n58:38.680 --> 58:39.680\n Murder Island.\n\n58:39.680 --> 58:42.040\n We would know who would be committing the murder.\n\n58:42.040 --> 58:44.400\n I have the suit for it.\n\n58:44.400 --> 58:49.000\n So he has the saying of facts don't care about your feelings.\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:56.560\n And I've always felt badly about that statement somehow, like it was incomplete.\n\n58:56.560 --> 59:01.960\n So it's interesting that you mentioned bringing your emotions in line with your thinking.\n\n59:01.960 --> 59:03.840\n What do you think about that statement?\n\n59:03.840 --> 59:05.320\n I got this one.\n\n59:05.320 --> 59:16.320\n What Ben is doing in a loose way is attacking Kantianism because Kant, it's almost impossible\n\n59:16.320 --> 59:21.240\n for Westerners who aren't schooled in this to understand the idea of philosophical idealism\n\n59:21.240 --> 59:25.760\n because it sounds so crazy that you're like, these great minds of all time can't really\n\n59:25.760 --> 59:26.760\n be saying this.\n\n59:26.760 --> 59:27.760\n I must be missing something.\n\n59:27.760 --> 59:32.880\n So when we hear idealism, we think John F. Kennedy is a good example.\n\n59:32.880 --> 59:33.880\n You aspire things.\n\n59:33.880 --> 59:35.720\n You think life can be better than it is.\n\n59:35.720 --> 59:38.080\n That's not what it means in a philosophical sense.\n\n59:38.080 --> 59:43.820\n In philosophical idealism, it means ideas are more real than reality.\n\n59:43.820 --> 59:47.000\n That I have this idea, then this comes along.\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.640\n It's the reality that isn't correct.\n\n59:49.640 --> 59:50.640\n My idea is still correct.\n\n59:50.640 --> 59:53.780\n A good example of this that you see all the time on the internet is when they refer to\n\n59:53.780 --> 59:58.640\n Mitt Romney and John McCain as rhinos, Republicans in name only.\n\n59:58.640 --> 1:00:01.700\n And it's like, who is more a real Republican?\n\n1:00:01.700 --> 1:00:07.220\n The nominee of the party, the Senator, the governor of the party, or some person in your\n\n1:00:07.220 --> 1:00:11.080\n mind who has never existed and there's no evidence for them existing.\n\n1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:16.800\n So what Kant did is he bifurcated reality into what we see around us, the phenomenal\n\n1:00:16.800 --> 1:00:19.360\n world, but then it's inferior.\n\n1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:25.640\n The real world, the noumenal world, we can't access it because we have eyes.\n\n1:00:25.640 --> 1:00:29.440\n We only see the thing as it appears, not as it is in itself.\n\n1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:33.200\n And because of this, everything we know is a shadow and is secondary.\n\n1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:35.320\n And that's Plato, straight out of Plato.\n\n1:00:35.320 --> 1:00:38.360\n And the real reality is this realm of ideas.\n\n1:00:38.360 --> 1:00:44.000\n So when Ben is saying facts don't care about your feelings, what he is really saying is\n\n1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:45.360\n reality comes first.\n\n1:00:45.360 --> 1:00:48.800\n Your feelings have to be a response or a reaction to it.\n\n1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:50.720\n You can't say, this is how I feel.\n\n1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:52.240\n This table doesn't care.\n\n1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:54.040\n You can yell at it all day long.\n\n1:00:54.040 --> 1:00:57.560\n It will still be indifferent to your emotional state because it comes first.\n\n1:00:57.560 --> 1:00:59.160\n So it's a great statement.\n\n1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:04.320\n I think he's cribbing it from Ayn Rand in a sense, and there's a sense in which he is.\n\n1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:07.000\n I mean, who popularized that kind of idea?\n\n1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.320\n And Ben has read Ayn Rand quite extensively.\n\n1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:10.320\n Not enough.\n\n1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:11.320\n Not enough.\n\n1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:12.320\n Well.\n\n1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:13.320\n Not enough to reference her.\n\n1:01:13.320 --> 1:01:14.320\n That's the way the army goes.\n\n1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:15.320\n So yeah, obviously.\n\n1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:19.560\n He may be read enough, but didn't understand enough.\n\n1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:24.640\n But so it's absolutely reality.\n\n1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:29.520\n Reality is unaffected by your emotional state and your feelings about it.\n\n1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:35.120\n And this is a great claim against the idealism, the philosophical idealism of much of the\n\n1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:36.480\n world out there, both left and right.\n\n1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:40.520\n I think politically, culturally, the left and right are detached from reality.\n\n1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:44.560\n They live in a different dimension, in a different space that they are creating in their own\n\n1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:47.160\n minds that has nothing to do with the real world.\n\n1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:52.680\n And when they fail, they make stuff up to justify their failure, right?\n\n1:01:52.680 --> 1:02:01.120\n So all of really the ideas that are promulgated today on both sides are this kind of detached\n\n1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:02.120\n from reality.\n\n1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:07.320\n We're putting emotions or ideas before reality itself.\n\n1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:11.360\n But I believe that emotions are responses.\n\n1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:17.320\n The responses to reality conditioned by our existing concepts.\n\n1:02:17.320 --> 1:02:20.200\n You're going to have to talk slowly to talk emotions to Lex because he doesn't really\n\n1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:21.200\n understand what that is.\n\n1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:22.200\n I don't understand.\n\n1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:24.400\n That's a really, you got to really taste your words.\n\n1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:25.920\n But he's big on love?\n\n1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:26.920\n What is love?\n\n1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:27.920\n But he's big on love?\n\n1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:28.920\n He's trying to learn.\n\n1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:29.920\n Pretty big on love.\n\n1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:32.520\n I'm all in, I'm a love maximalist.\n\n1:02:32.520 --> 1:02:36.800\n I mean, I could create, we could create an environment on this island where you would\n\n1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:38.200\n really feel emotions.\n\n1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:40.120\n Like fear is an emotion.\n\n1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:41.120\n We could.\n\n1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:42.680\n That's the metaphysical terror.\n\n1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:47.280\n We could easily terrorize you to the point where you felt fear, right?\n\n1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:49.760\n So we could teach him about emotion.\n\n1:02:49.760 --> 1:02:51.280\n But emotions are a response to reality.\n\n1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:54.960\n So some people, for example, you could take five different people and show them exactly\n\n1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:55.960\n the same thing.\n\n1:02:55.960 --> 1:03:00.600\n And some of them would feel fear and some of them would actually feel indifferent and\n\n1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:03.720\n other people might feel love, right?\n\n1:03:03.720 --> 1:03:09.880\n I think Leonard Peacock uses the example of looking through a microscope and seeing a,\n\n1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:11.560\n I don't know, a virus or bacteria.\n\n1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:13.880\n And for one, it's a scientist, he's made a new discovery.\n\n1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:17.520\n He feels pride and love and awe.\n\n1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:22.240\n The one has no clue, right, and he's looking at this and it means nothing to them and somebody\n\n1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:26.600\n else might look at it and it's a bacteria and they feel fear because of what it could\n\n1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:27.600\n do to them.\n\n1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:33.260\n So it's conditioned by what you know, what your values are and your level of knowledge\n\n1:03:33.260 --> 1:03:35.880\n and what the thing is out there in reality.\n\n1:03:35.880 --> 1:03:40.560\n And it's that into, so your emotions respond to that.\n\n1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:48.360\n So aligning your emotions with your reason is making sure that your emotions are really\n\n1:03:48.360 --> 1:03:53.900\n conditioned by what you know explicitly versus what you've internalized implicitly that\n\n1:03:53.900 --> 1:03:55.880\n you might not agree with anymore.\n\n1:03:55.880 --> 1:04:02.160\n You know, things might happen in your childhood and they probably do, right, where you get\n\n1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:03.160\n a trauma.\n\n1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:09.320\n I don't know, I'm afraid of dogs and maybe when I was a five year old, some dogs jumped\n\n1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:11.440\n at me and I don't even remember it, right?\n\n1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:16.120\n But I came to a conclusion when I was five, dogs bad, dogs dangerous, right?\n\n1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:20.880\n And now anytime I see a dog, oh my God, that bringing my emotions aligned with reality,\n\n1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:26.160\n right, with my ideas is no, now I understand dogs don't have to be scary.\n\n1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:30.920\n I can work through this and there are various techniques and hopefully if there is such\n\n1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:35.680\n a science of psychology, but in psychology to get you to the point where you can get\n\n1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:40.800\n rid of that fear and align your emotion now with your explicit ideas, and that's what\n\n1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:41.800\n I mean by that.\n\n1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:45.280\n And let me build on that, talking about your friend Putin, I think I mentioned this before\n\n1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:47.760\n at least maybe on the show, he was meeting with Angela Merkel.\n\n1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:48.760\n Oh, Vladimir, please.\n\n1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:50.880\n Yeah, Vlad, my boy Vlad.\n\n1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:55.800\n He was meeting with Angela Merkel, Angela Merkel has a fear of dogs, so he brought out\n\n1:04:55.800 --> 1:05:00.400\n his big Labrador Retriever, now for people who don't know, Labradors are very big dogs,\n\n1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:03.520\n but they're also like the least aggressive, it's like you could punch them in the face,\n\n1:05:03.520 --> 1:05:04.960\n they don't care.\n\n1:05:04.960 --> 1:05:10.440\n That dog is not going to be more likely to attack just because she's scared.\n\n1:05:10.440 --> 1:05:15.500\n And I know they say animals can sense fear, domesticated dogs, if they see you're scared,\n\n1:05:15.500 --> 1:05:17.520\n they're not going to be aggressive, they're going to try to play.\n\n1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:22.240\n I remember when I was a kid, there was this dog, Rex, this German Shepherd, I'm five,\n\n1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:26.040\n this dog is gigantic, and I'm sitting on the couch, the German Shepherds have been bred\n\n1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:29.080\n for intelligence, they're very bright dogs, they're very good with kids, he's sitting\n\n1:05:29.080 --> 1:05:32.160\n next to me, this thing is three times my size.\n\n1:05:32.160 --> 1:05:37.440\n He very gently puts his paw on my leg to be like, kid, he can sense my fear, he's like,\n\n1:05:37.440 --> 1:05:40.920\n I'm not going to do it, I want to be your friend, I'm still freaking out.\n\n1:05:40.920 --> 1:05:45.000\n He licks my hand, it's just very scary, you know, animals are so bright, but that's the\n\n1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:50.280\n thing is, in terms of facts don't care about your feelings, that dog is not more likely\n\n1:05:50.280 --> 1:05:54.560\n to attack someone because their emotion is so intense.\n\n1:05:54.560 --> 1:06:01.120\n It's not that I feel something very strongly, therefore, this thing is more likely to happen.\n\n1:06:01.120 --> 1:06:07.260\n So my intensity of my emotion does not in any way correlate, when you're being irrational,\n\n1:06:07.260 --> 1:06:09.320\n to the likelihood of that thing actually happening.\n\n1:06:09.320 --> 1:06:12.280\n Now, you could have a dog that does respond to your emotion, right?\n\n1:06:12.280 --> 1:06:16.820\n But then it's, but then it's not, that's part of reality, right?\n\n1:06:16.820 --> 1:06:20.320\n That's a fact of reality that certain dogs respond to certain emotions.\n\n1:06:20.320 --> 1:06:25.400\n But isn't this emotion a part of reality, like, okay, let me say a word.\n\n1:06:25.400 --> 1:06:30.640\n So part of that, I would even say, don't let your emotion about your emotion, right, because\n\n1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:36.760\n sometimes you have an emotion about your emotion, don't be repressed, and identify the emotion\n\n1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:41.280\n as reality, and evaluate it, don't judge it, evaluate it.\n\n1:06:41.280 --> 1:06:42.520\n Is it a rational emotion?\n\n1:06:42.520 --> 1:06:47.440\n Is it consistent with my, like, if I'm afraid of these dogs, if I feel that fear, is it\n\n1:06:47.440 --> 1:06:49.240\n rational to be afraid of these dogs?\n\n1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:53.560\n But you're speaking to your own individual trajectory as a human being as you grow through\n\n1:06:53.560 --> 1:06:57.260\n the world and try to understand reality and connect yourself through reason to reality.\n\n1:06:57.260 --> 1:07:02.280\n What I'm talking about is a term like lived experience.\n\n1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:09.880\n When you observe and analyze the, you know, conversations with other people to try to\n\n1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:16.200\n understand how other people see the world, doesn't emotion fundamentally integrate into\n\n1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:17.200\n that?\n\n1:07:17.200 --> 1:07:19.160\n Like, isn't emotion lived experience?\n\n1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:24.200\n So everybody experiences the same reality, but the way they experience it might be very\n\n1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:25.200\n different.\n\n1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:26.200\n And that has to do with what?\n\n1:07:26.200 --> 1:07:27.200\n It doesn't have to do with\u2026\n\n1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:30.840\n With their values, with their conclusions, with their ideas, with their experiences,\n\n1:07:30.840 --> 1:07:31.840\n with a million different things, right?\n\n1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:32.840\n But is it\u2026\n\n1:07:32.840 --> 1:07:35.480\n But at the end of the day, it's about the conclusions that they come to, which are then\n\n1:07:35.480 --> 1:07:37.200\n shaping their emotions.\n\n1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:40.320\n But look, emotions are not something to be avoided or ignored.\n\n1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:43.440\n That is, I can sense your emotions to some extent, right?\n\n1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:44.440\n That's a lie.\n\n1:07:44.440 --> 1:07:45.440\n Okay, it is Lex.\n\n1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:46.440\n I can sense his emotions.\n\n1:07:46.440 --> 1:07:47.440\n Thank you.\n\n1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:48.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:48.440 --> 1:07:52.260\n I can sense Michael's emotions, and that's part of the fact of reality, right?\n\n1:07:52.260 --> 1:07:58.760\n So if Michael responds to something that I view as really, really important, right?\n\n1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:03.000\n If we were standing in front of Michelangelo's David, and Michael responds to Michelangelo's\n\n1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:07.920\n David and goes, eh, and turned his back to it and walked away, that would be really meaningful\n\n1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:08.920\n to me, right?\n\n1:08:08.920 --> 1:08:12.640\n That I would respond emotionally to that, and cognitively I would say, what is it about\n\n1:08:12.640 --> 1:08:16.520\n Michael that makes him, you know, respond this way?\n\n1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:17.520\n That is\u2026\n\n1:08:17.520 --> 1:08:18.960\n That gives me a lot of information about him.\n\n1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:22.600\n So emotions are information laden, right?\n\n1:08:22.600 --> 1:08:25.040\n But they are not primary.\n\n1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:29.160\n They are responses, responses to something.\n\n1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:34.480\n So one must be very aware of one's own emotions, recognize them, and analyze them.\n\n1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:38.200\n And one should be aware of other people's emotions, if they're important to you, if\n\n1:08:38.200 --> 1:08:39.200\n they're not important to you.\n\n1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:40.200\n It doesn't matter, right?\n\n1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:43.240\n You don't care about a stranger's emotion, you know, like a stranger walks up to Michael\n\n1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:49.920\n and Michelangelo's David and said, eh, and walks away, and I go, okay, I'm glad you're\n\n1:08:49.920 --> 1:08:50.920\n a stranger.\n\n1:08:50.920 --> 1:08:51.920\n But it's\u2026\n\n1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:56.080\n Now, I don't know what Michael's response to Michelangelo's David was or is, so I'm\n\n1:08:56.080 --> 1:08:57.720\n a little worried about what he's gonna say.\n\n1:08:57.720 --> 1:08:58.720\n You got candy too, that was great.\n\n1:08:58.720 --> 1:08:59.720\n Hey, hey, I thought I was special.\n\n1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:00.720\n Do I get Ukrainian candy?\n\n1:09:00.720 --> 1:09:01.720\n I don't know, I can't read either.\n\n1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:02.720\n What's this say, Joshua?\n\n1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:03.720\n What does that say to him?\n\n1:09:03.720 --> 1:09:04.720\n Is this Ukrainian candy as well?\n\n1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:05.720\n I thought it was sent to me from\u2026\n\n1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:12.720\n Do you know that Atlas Shrugged was the bestselling book in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016?\n\n1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:17.120\n Do you know Atlas Shrugged was translated to Russian by someone who's now a crypto like\n\n1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:20.600\n billionaire and he made like six copies and I have one of them and I sent it to my great\n\n1:09:20.600 --> 1:09:21.600\n grandma.\n\n1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:22.600\n No, they're more than six, but yeah.\n\n1:09:22.600 --> 1:09:23.600\n Oh, but they were like\u2026\n\n1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:24.600\n Because I have a copy too.\n\n1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:25.600\n Okay.\n\n1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:26.600\n Not I personally, the institute has a copy.\n\n1:09:26.600 --> 1:09:28.960\n I sent it to my great grandma and she said, why is he sending me this, I wanna read books\n\n1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:29.960\n about love.\n\n1:09:29.960 --> 1:09:30.960\n And I'm like, you know what?\n\n1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:31.960\n This is about love.\n\n1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:32.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:33.960\n That's what you should have said.\n\n1:09:33.960 --> 1:09:34.960\n What's that, what does that say?\n\n1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:35.960\n So this says it's\u2026\n\n1:09:35.960 --> 1:09:36.960\n It has vitamins and minerals.\n\n1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:37.960\n If it's in Russian, I don't believe it.\n\n1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:50.880\n It just sounds really strange to read like health information in Russian, I'm already\n\n1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:51.880\n distressed.\n\n1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:53.440\n But look, there's a Yorshik like you have.\n\n1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:54.440\n Exactly.\n\n1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:58.360\n I mean, I'm much, I like Kiev much more than I like Moscow.\n\n1:09:58.360 --> 1:09:59.360\n Wow.\n\n1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:00.360\n Strong words.\n\n1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:02.640\n But this is, this is not, it's like hard candy.\n\n1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:03.640\n I don't know.\n\n1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:07.360\n I think this, some of my friends sent me that's made with blood to give the kids iron.\n\n1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:08.360\n Whose blood?\n\n1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:09.360\n Like cow blood.\n\n1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:10.360\n Oh.\n\n1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:11.360\n Like with chocolate.\n\n1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:12.360\n All right.\n\n1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:13.360\n You can keep it.\n\n1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:14.360\n That's all you.\n\n1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:15.360\n All right.\n\n1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:16.360\n I'm keeping both of these.\n\n1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:18.480\n Can I take something you're talking about with emotion?\n\n1:10:18.480 --> 1:10:23.160\n Something that is very pernicious in terms of emotion is people denying the validity\n\n1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:24.380\n of their own emotions.\n\n1:10:24.380 --> 1:10:28.620\n And here's one example, someone could be in an abusive relationship or have had an\n\n1:10:28.620 --> 1:10:32.780\n abusive childhood and they think, well, I didn't have a black eye.\n\n1:10:32.780 --> 1:10:33.780\n We had dinner on the table.\n\n1:10:33.780 --> 1:10:35.960\n It wasn't abusive because you hear some other story.\n\n1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:41.000\n So they feel their emotion is invalid or like, oh, he never lays hands on me.\n\n1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:42.760\n He gets drunk and is mean to me.\n\n1:10:42.760 --> 1:10:44.700\n He's still basically a good person.\n\n1:10:44.700 --> 1:10:46.240\n You're denying that emotion.\n\n1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:49.240\n And that emotion is a response to something real.\n\n1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:52.200\n There's an expression, I have friends who are in 12 step programs.\n\n1:10:52.200 --> 1:10:56.560\n There's an expression there, which I think is very profound, which is if it's hysterical,\n\n1:10:56.560 --> 1:10:57.560\n it's historical.\n\n1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:03.840\n Meaning if some minor incident is having an extreme disproportionate impact on you, think,\n\n1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:08.160\n ask yourself, why am I responding in such an extreme way to some minor thing?\n\n1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:13.160\n And I will tell you 10 times out of 10, you'll go back and you'll be like, oh, I'm feeling\n\n1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:18.240\n now like I felt when I was eight and my dad came home and he was a total jerk and I didn't\n\n1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:19.240\n do anything wrong.\n\n1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:21.680\n And he thought I had, and I was complete powerless.\n\n1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:23.360\n And now I'm in the same situation, my boss.\n\n1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:27.280\n I'm not that eight year old in one sense I am, in another sense I'm not, but I feel the\n\n1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:28.560\n same way I did as a kid.\n\n1:11:28.560 --> 1:11:32.500\n And this is a very useful mechanism in terms of furthering one's happiness because you\n\n1:11:32.500 --> 1:11:35.360\n kind of deprogram all those things that you picked up as a child.\n\n1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:39.240\n But it's also, you know, if you're feeling something wrong, even though you're trying\n\n1:11:39.240 --> 1:11:42.520\n to rationalize in a way, you know, it's not abusive because he's not hitting me.\n\n1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:46.200\n No, the emotion is telling you something real about what's going on.\n\n1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:50.080\n So acknowledge it and fix the situation, right?\n\n1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:54.420\n So one of the powers emotions give you is they send you signals about something that\n\n1:11:54.420 --> 1:11:57.000\n might not be in cognition yet.\n\n1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:01.520\n And when you examine their emotion, it brings it to cognition and now you can act on it.\n\n1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:06.100\n So maybe the boss is abusive, but I didn't really think of it in those terms of my emotions\n\n1:12:06.100 --> 1:12:07.720\n is sending me signals.\n\n1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:09.400\n And now that I signal it, I'm going to resign.\n\n1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:11.160\n I'm going to find a better, another job.\n\n1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:12.960\n I'm going to complain to his boss or whatever.\n\n1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:14.740\n I'm going to take action.\n\n1:12:14.740 --> 1:12:17.940\n Why do you think Ayn Rand is such a controversial figure?\n\n1:12:17.940 --> 1:12:23.800\n Last time I spoke with you on this particular podcast, the, the amount of emails I've gotten\n\n1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:28.720\n positive and negative and certainly negative, I don't usually get negative emails.\n\n1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:29.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:31.920\n I can't, I can't relate.\n\n1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:34.480\n I'm sure mine were all positive or only positive.\n\n1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:39.120\n It was mostly women sending pictures for me to forward to you because you didn't send\n\n1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:40.120\n me anything.\n\n1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:43.120\n Oh, it's the wrong email address.\n\n1:12:43.120 --> 1:12:44.120\n Sorry.\n\n1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:45.120\n I kept bouncing.\n\n1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:51.160\n Oh, so this is love.\n\n1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:52.160\n Love hurts.\n\n1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:53.160\n Okay.\n\n1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:54.160\n Yes.\n\n1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:55.160\n No.\n\n1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:56.160\n But why do you think she's such a divisive figure?\n\n1:12:56.160 --> 1:12:59.560\n Why do you think she provokes such emotion in both the positive and the negative side?\n\n1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:02.040\n I'd love to hear both of your viewpoints on this.\n\n1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:05.760\n Well, I think on the negative side and both on the positive and the negative side, I think\n\n1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:08.200\n it's because she's radical.\n\n1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:10.440\n She's consistently radical.\n\n1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:17.720\n She upends the, the premises, the ideas that are prevalent in the culture that were brought\n\n1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:24.440\n up on the, that, that are like, you know, they're like milk and, and, and, you know,\n\n1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:26.640\n the basic stuff that we're, we're growing up.\n\n1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:27.640\n You have to be altruistic.\n\n1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:29.100\n You have to live for other people.\n\n1:13:29.100 --> 1:13:30.400\n That's just basic stuff.\n\n1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:31.400\n Nobody challenges that.\n\n1:13:31.400 --> 1:13:32.480\n Nobody questions it.\n\n1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:37.960\n And if they do question it, they usually question it from the perspective of a cynic or a bad\n\n1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:38.960\n guy.\n\n1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:39.960\n Right.\n\n1:13:39.960 --> 1:13:40.960\n You mentioned the book, the Joker, right.\n\n1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:41.960\n Before we started, right.\n\n1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:44.960\n You know, I'm going to upend the world because I don't care about other people.\n\n1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:45.960\n Right.\n\n1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:49.840\n So, so they're presented with these two alternatives and it's real in people's lives, right?\n\n1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:56.520\n You either live for other people or you're a evil SOB and you know, yeah, most people\n\n1:13:56.520 --> 1:14:00.760\n in either one of those, but the ethic is right here.\n\n1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:02.080\n It's living for other people.\n\n1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:05.560\n And when you challenge that, they have no way cognitively to go with that.\n\n1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:08.680\n And the only place they can go with that cognitively is to the Joker.\n\n1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:09.980\n It's the evil guy.\n\n1:14:09.980 --> 1:14:14.040\n It's the somebody who wants to smash everything and destroy because they don't have this alternative\n\n1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:19.740\n conception of, oh no, you can be rationally self interested and that does not involve\n\n1:14:19.740 --> 1:14:25.460\n destruction and that does not involve, you know, just exploiting other people.\n\n1:14:25.460 --> 1:14:27.440\n They can't conceptualize that.\n\n1:14:27.440 --> 1:14:30.060\n It's not in their framework.\n\n1:14:30.060 --> 1:14:34.220\n So it's the fact that she's so consistently on the side of self interest, for example,\n\n1:14:34.220 --> 1:14:37.640\n on the side of capitalism, on the side of freedom.\n\n1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:42.560\n It's the fact that she dismisses faith to the extent that she does or to the extent\n\n1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:47.360\n that I do, right, that alienates people because that is completely different from what they\n\n1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:48.360\n brought up.\n\n1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:52.840\n Now the flip side of that is it's also really interesting to some people.\n\n1:14:52.840 --> 1:14:56.900\n So you know, a lot of, you got some positives, right?\n\n1:14:56.900 --> 1:14:58.640\n And I got a lot of positives from that appearance.\n\n1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:02.280\n I know a lot of people came to my podcast because I appeared on your show.\n\n1:15:02.280 --> 1:15:03.280\n Why?\n\n1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:08.520\n Because they hear something that's completely fresh, new, different, they've never heard\n\n1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:09.520\n before.\n\n1:15:09.520 --> 1:15:13.640\n It appeals to something in them that maybe, you know, a lot of people say I read Ayn Rand\n\n1:15:13.640 --> 1:15:15.620\n and it confirmed everything I believed.\n\n1:15:15.620 --> 1:15:16.620\n Now for me it didn't.\n\n1:15:16.620 --> 1:15:17.620\n It was the opposite.\n\n1:15:17.620 --> 1:15:21.480\n It turned upside down everything I believed, but there are a lot of people out there that\n\n1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:26.360\n do have a sense that something's wrong in the world, that altruism is wrong, that socialism,\n\n1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:29.960\n just the stuff and religion is wrong, but they don't have an alternative.\n\n1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:31.280\n It hasn't coalesced.\n\n1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:35.640\n And they listen to a lot of podcasts because they're trying to get ideas of what is it\n\n1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:37.560\n that I'm sensing that's wrong out there?\n\n1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:42.080\n And suddenly somebody comes out and gives them some clear explanation of things and\n\n1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:45.240\n they go, wow, that's what I've been looking for my whole life.\n\n1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:48.280\n So that's the positive for people.\n\n1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:53.000\n You know, and I read Ayn Rand, it just all made sense.\n\n1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:59.080\n It all clicked and it all, and it made clear that everything I believed to that point was\n\n1:15:59.080 --> 1:16:00.080\n just wrong.\n\n1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:02.280\n It just didn't, it didn't integrate.\n\n1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:05.720\n And I always knew to some extent it didn't integrate, but there was no alternative, so\n\n1:16:05.720 --> 1:16:06.720\n I believed it.\n\n1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:07.720\n What else was there?\n\n1:16:07.720 --> 1:16:12.680\n I remember saying to myself as a kid, probably 15, why should I, why is this, why is morality\n\n1:16:12.680 --> 1:16:14.040\n all about other people?\n\n1:16:14.040 --> 1:16:15.040\n Why is that?\n\n1:16:15.040 --> 1:16:17.480\n Well, that's just the way it is, right?\n\n1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:19.160\n And I couldn't, couldn't come up with an explanation.\n\n1:16:19.160 --> 1:16:23.400\n She gave me the explanation and she gave me the explanation why it's wrong to do that.\n\n1:16:23.400 --> 1:16:25.900\n And I think, so I think that's why people respond.\n\n1:16:25.900 --> 1:16:27.360\n It's just too radical.\n\n1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:32.080\n It can't fit into their cognitive framework that they have been brought up on, that they've\n\n1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:35.360\n been educated on, that just their whole life revolves around.\n\n1:16:35.360 --> 1:16:40.480\n Michael, you don't bring up Ayn Rand that much in conversation, except as kind of references\n\n1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:44.400\n every once in a while as part of the humor of just the general flow in the music of the\n\n1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:45.920\n way you like to talk.\n\n1:16:45.920 --> 1:16:52.000\n Well, why do you think you don't integrate her into your philosophy when you're like\n\n1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:54.320\n explaining ideas and all those kinds of things?\n\n1:16:54.320 --> 1:17:01.440\n Like, why is she not, you know, a popular reference point for discussion of ideas?\n\n1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:05.400\n Because I, I don't know if Yaron's going to agree with or can agree with me.\n\n1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:09.280\n I think for a certain percentage of the population, actually I talked to someone from the Ayn\n\n1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:12.720\n Rand Institute, I forgot his name, older guy with glasses and he didn't disagree with me.\n\n1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:13.720\n He said, this is changing.\n\n1:17:13.720 --> 1:17:17.720\n He said, I think for a certain percentage of the population who are uninformed about\n\n1:17:17.720 --> 1:17:23.160\n her work, higher than 10%, less than 50%, you mentioned Ayn Rand, they have been trained\n\n1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:25.640\n to think this is identical Scientology.\n\n1:17:25.640 --> 1:17:28.560\n So as soon as her name comes up, it's like, okay, I'm out the door.\n\n1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:30.440\n I'm not going to have anything to do with this.\n\n1:17:30.440 --> 1:17:32.080\n And everyone who follows her is a crazy person.\n\n1:17:32.080 --> 1:17:33.960\n That's one thing that has happened.\n\n1:17:33.960 --> 1:17:40.240\n Another thing is Rand in her personality was very aggressive and antagonistic.\n\n1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:45.080\n She was for a long time, the lone voice in the wilderness being like, this isn't like\n\n1:17:45.080 --> 1:17:50.040\n one of her big adversaries in a certain sense is Milton Friedman.\n\n1:17:50.040 --> 1:17:55.760\n And she really hated how Milton Friedman was like, oh, you know, having rent control is\n\n1:17:55.760 --> 1:17:56.760\n inefficient.\n\n1:17:56.760 --> 1:17:58.340\n And she's like, inefficient?\n\n1:17:58.340 --> 1:18:02.400\n We're talking about mass homelessness and people dying.\n\n1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:06.760\n And you're talking about this, like what color tie goes with this color shirt?\n\n1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:07.760\n Are you insane?\n\n1:18:07.760 --> 1:18:09.840\n And in fact, it's hilarious.\n\n1:18:09.840 --> 1:18:12.800\n There was an organization called the Foundation for Economic Education fee.\n\n1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:15.680\n Leonard Reed was the head of this.\n\n1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:18.960\n And there were a series of letters and she was helping him.\n\n1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:22.600\n She was much more philosophically grounded in certain contexts than he was.\n\n1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:27.440\n And there was an essay, a pamphlet that he published called Roofs or Ceilings.\n\n1:18:27.440 --> 1:18:32.200\n It was cowritten by Milton Friedman, later Nobel prize winner and George Stigler, also\n\n1:18:32.200 --> 1:18:33.880\n later Nobel prize winner.\n\n1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:39.080\n And basically the argument was, well, if the government controls all housing, how's that\n\n1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:40.280\n going to work out?\n\n1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:43.840\n And she's sitting there and she's typing in all caps.\n\n1:18:43.840 --> 1:18:49.160\n So you know, she's holding on the shift key and doing this on a typewriter and being like\n\n1:18:49.160 --> 1:18:50.160\n how?\n\n1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:55.760\n And you can imagine her with her cigarette holder, apoplectic, being like, how is an\n\n1:18:55.760 --> 1:19:04.880\n organization ostensibly devoted to free enterprise discussing this Stalinist idea in the most\n\n1:19:04.880 --> 1:19:06.160\n casual of terms?\n\n1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:07.300\n She's like, have I taught you not?\n\n1:19:07.300 --> 1:19:13.000\n And what's amazing is, so at Fee, they only have her letters because she sent them to\n\n1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:14.000\n Reed.\n\n1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:16.280\n The Ayn Rand Institute must have Leonard Reed's letters.\n\n1:19:16.280 --> 1:19:21.160\n I was able to, knowing Rand enough, predict exactly what the conversation would go like\n\n1:19:21.160 --> 1:19:26.300\n because he also did something she didn't approve of, which is he asked other people for feedback\n\n1:19:26.300 --> 1:19:27.300\n on her work.\n\n1:19:27.300 --> 1:19:29.640\n And she goes, I gave this to you to read.\n\n1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:33.120\n Who are you shopping around to some jerk that I don't, I need their approval.\n\n1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:34.120\n What are you doing?\n\n1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:38.200\n So it was a very interesting situation, but so that's one issue.\n\n1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:40.480\n I remember this is Ayn Rand when she's young.\n\n1:19:40.480 --> 1:19:41.480\n She wasn't that young.\n\n1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:42.480\n It was in the 40s.\n\n1:19:42.480 --> 1:19:43.480\n She's relatively young, right?\n\n1:19:43.480 --> 1:19:44.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:45.480\n It's before Atlas Shrugged.\n\n1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:46.480\n It was before Atlas Shrugged.\n\n1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:47.480\n So it's before she's super famous.\n\n1:19:47.480 --> 1:19:55.200\n And before this is, the found has been published, but you know, she's trying to work with others\n\n1:19:55.200 --> 1:19:57.200\n and they are disappointing her left and right.\n\n1:19:57.200 --> 1:19:58.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:58.200 --> 1:20:06.720\n And also when you are a, what she takes away from bad people is you have these kids, right?\n\n1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:09.160\n And you're going to sit down with them and they're going to be like, yeah, I'm going\n\n1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:10.240\n to take your guns.\n\n1:20:10.240 --> 1:20:12.760\n I'm going to lock you in your house.\n\n1:20:12.760 --> 1:20:16.600\n I'm going to take 60% of your income and all this other stuff.\n\n1:20:16.600 --> 1:20:21.040\n And they might, up to reading Rand, they might sit down and have a discussion.\n\n1:20:21.040 --> 1:20:23.400\n And Rand goes, Hey, you know what?\n\n1:20:23.400 --> 1:20:25.240\n You didn't have to give them an answer.\n\n1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:27.100\n You could say, go to hell.\n\n1:20:27.100 --> 1:20:32.840\n We're not having this conversation and you have no right to one second of my life.\n\n1:20:32.840 --> 1:20:35.480\n And this is not a legitimate opener.\n\n1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:36.820\n This is a declaration of war.\n\n1:20:36.820 --> 1:20:40.040\n This isn't like, it's not like if I sit down with you, I run like, Hey, Ron, here are my\n\n1:20:40.040 --> 1:20:41.040\n plans for your wife.\n\n1:20:41.040 --> 1:20:42.040\n Go to hell.\n\n1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:43.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:43.040 --> 1:20:44.040\n This isn't a conversation we're having.\n\n1:20:44.040 --> 1:20:45.400\n Oh, I'm going to make you unsafe in your house.\n\n1:20:45.400 --> 1:20:46.400\n What?\n\n1:20:46.400 --> 1:20:47.400\n This is not a discussion.\n\n1:20:47.400 --> 1:20:52.000\n So what happens is these people who five minutes ago were able to have a debate with this kid\n\n1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.260\n because people read Rand when they're young often.\n\n1:20:54.260 --> 1:20:57.120\n And now that kid is like, yeah, I'm not even talking to you.\n\n1:20:57.120 --> 1:20:58.360\n It's her fault.\n\n1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:03.260\n Whereas in reality, it's that person's fault because that person had no right, although\n\n1:21:03.260 --> 1:21:06.860\n they've been trained to the contrary of our culture to believe, yeah, I'm going to sit\n\n1:21:06.860 --> 1:21:11.020\n down and we're just going to equally have a discussion over your own life.\n\n1:21:11.020 --> 1:21:14.080\n And you have one vote and I have one vote and we're going to know Lex has a vote and\n\n1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:18.020\n that's just how it's going to be and Rand's not having it.\n\n1:21:18.020 --> 1:21:19.760\n So I think those are two issues.\n\n1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:22.240\n And there's some other things which, which I don't need to get into.\n\n1:21:22.240 --> 1:21:27.840\n But I, I, because one of the things that Rand said consisting of her life is that her philosophy\n\n1:21:27.840 --> 1:21:29.980\n is an integrated whole, right?\n\n1:21:29.980 --> 1:21:33.720\n So to be an objectivist isn't just like, I like Atlas shrugged.\n\n1:21:33.720 --> 1:21:37.160\n It means I accept objectivism as a totality.\n\n1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:43.560\n Since I do not, I don't, I think it is proper to be respectful to her wishes and not constantly\n\n1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:46.440\n be, especially given that I've somewhat of a platform to be like Ayn Rand, Ayn Rand,\n\n1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:50.360\n Ayn Rand, because I don't think Ayn Rand would have liked it if I was talking about Ayn Rand\n\n1:21:50.360 --> 1:21:51.360\n this much.\n\n1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:54.300\n So how do you, how do you deprogram?\n\n1:21:54.300 --> 1:21:58.540\n Because I don't like to bring up Ayn Rand just because I do see what, like how people\n\n1:21:58.540 --> 1:22:00.000\n roll their eyes essentially.\n\n1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:03.280\n So how do you, what's the upside, exactly.\n\n1:22:03.280 --> 1:22:08.520\n But what is that pro, can we, can you speak to that programming that people have?\n\n1:22:08.520 --> 1:22:12.500\n I mean, look, at the end of the day, if you talk about the ideas and the ideas make sense\n\n1:22:12.500 --> 1:22:15.680\n and people are attracted to the ideas, then you say, oh, by the way, and this came from\n\n1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:18.560\n Ayn Rand, that's how you deprogram them, right?\n\n1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:23.160\n If you make the ideas prevalent in the culture, if people start viewing self interest as something\n\n1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:27.800\n that's kind of, that's interesting and worthwhile and something worth investigating, and they\n\n1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:32.940\n said, oh, that came from Ayn Rand, then I think, I think then we'll, we'll deprogram\n\n1:22:32.940 --> 1:22:36.340\n them and get them and get them changing their minds about these things.\n\n1:22:36.340 --> 1:22:40.960\n And also, you know, going on shows where people are going to watch your show no matter who\n\n1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:41.960\n you bring on.\n\n1:22:41.960 --> 1:22:42.960\n Right.\n\n1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:48.440\n So, uh, even though now you do, you, if you put, you put Ayn Rand in the title that immediately\n\n1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:52.360\n reduces the number of people who watch, so, so in the future you shouldn't, but, uh, you\n\n1:22:52.360 --> 1:22:56.200\n put Michael Malice in the title and then at least the, the female population, the female\n\n1:22:56.200 --> 1:23:01.000\n to, you know, absolutely, just to see, but so, so you go and you try to make them as\n\n1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:04.240\n credible as possible to as many people as possible over time.\n\n1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:05.240\n It takes time.\n\n1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:08.420\n And ultimately, I don't think the culture will have this response to her.\n\n1:23:08.420 --> 1:23:12.000\n They might still disagree with her, but I think over time, and already you're seeing\n\n1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:16.360\n it, younger people, I think today are far less, there was a generation who never read\n\n1:23:16.360 --> 1:23:19.920\n Ayn Rand and was like this, bring out the garlic and the crosses.\n\n1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:22.040\n We don't want to have anything to do with it then.\n\n1:23:22.040 --> 1:23:25.600\n And I think today there are many more people who've read her and might disagree or not\n\n1:23:25.600 --> 1:23:26.600\n disagree.\n\n1:23:26.600 --> 1:23:27.600\n Right.\n\n1:23:27.600 --> 1:23:30.040\n And then there were a lot of people who haven't read her, but who are not opposed to it or\n\n1:23:30.040 --> 1:23:32.160\n willing to have an, to engage.\n\n1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:34.000\n So I think it's changing already.\n\n1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:35.560\n And I think in 20 years it'll be completely different.\n\n1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:38.920\n And just two more things that she does that I think it says that I think people find very,\n\n1:23:38.920 --> 1:23:41.020\n very off putting given our culture.\n\n1:23:41.020 --> 1:23:46.340\n One is she will, basically you could sit down with Rand and be like, your fear is not in\n\n1:23:46.340 --> 1:23:48.680\n any way a hold on my freedom.\n\n1:23:48.680 --> 1:23:50.000\n Just that one sentence.\n\n1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:55.760\n And for a lot of people that's very off putting and very harsh, it's correct.\n\n1:23:55.760 --> 1:23:59.040\n But for them, it's just like, wait a minute, I'm still scared.\n\n1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:00.040\n It's like, I don't care.\n\n1:24:00.040 --> 1:24:04.160\n Like for example, like with lockdowns and things like this, it's like, well, I'm scared\n\n1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:05.760\n and maybe I have a right to be scared.\n\n1:24:05.760 --> 1:24:08.340\n Or like, I'm scared that you have a gun in your house.\n\n1:24:08.340 --> 1:24:10.520\n And it's like, I respect that you're scared.\n\n1:24:10.520 --> 1:24:11.520\n I don't care.\n\n1:24:11.520 --> 1:24:13.920\n At the end, as you say at the end of the day, this is my house.\n\n1:24:13.920 --> 1:24:17.440\n I'm going to live my life as I please, as long as I don't hurt other people.\n\n1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:19.160\n Well, you are hurting me because I'm scared.\n\n1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:20.360\n No, that's not.\n\n1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:21.920\n This is the feeling versus fact.\n\n1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:22.920\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:24:22.920 --> 1:24:23.920\n So that is one situation.\n\n1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:26.200\n This is like a feeling versus freedom, essentially.\n\n1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:30.680\n Yes, where Rand is, that puts a lot of people off.\n\n1:24:30.680 --> 1:24:36.880\n I also think that historically, a lot of people who were drawn to her are drawn to her for\n\n1:24:36.880 --> 1:24:38.520\n the wrong reasons.\n\n1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:43.840\n That a lot of times, like Howard Rourke, the hero, we're gonna still say hero.\n\n1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:45.520\n You're supposed to say protagonist, but hero.\n\n1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:51.720\n The hero of the fountainhead, he's extremely intelligent, but he's also extremely uncompromising.\n\n1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:55.960\n What often ends up happening is you'll have a young kid who is somewhat intelligent, but\n\n1:24:55.960 --> 1:24:59.600\n then they pick up the personality and now you're someone I can't work with.\n\n1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:01.740\n And then it's like, you're not Howard Rourke, relax.\n\n1:25:01.740 --> 1:25:02.740\n You're not that skilled.\n\n1:25:02.740 --> 1:25:03.740\n You're not that talented.\n\n1:25:03.740 --> 1:25:08.880\n But because the character has to do personification and have certain aspects together, when kids\n\n1:25:08.880 --> 1:25:10.560\n read that, they might get the wrong idea.\n\n1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:11.560\n That's not Rand's fault.\n\n1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:12.680\n And it's more than that.\n\n1:25:12.680 --> 1:25:18.600\n It's so, I completely agree with that, but it's even broader than that.\n\n1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:24.400\n So here is, in my view, one of the geniuses of the millennium presenting a philosophy.\n\n1:25:24.400 --> 1:25:27.120\n And she's got not just the questions, in my view, she's got the answers.\n\n1:25:27.120 --> 1:25:30.600\n And you're reading them at 16 and you're reading the answers.\n\n1:25:30.600 --> 1:25:34.240\n You don't know at 16 that this is true.\n\n1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:37.560\n You might have a sense that it's true, but you don't have the life experience, the learned\n\n1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:38.560\n experience.\n\n1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:40.360\n You don't have the facts, you don't have the knowledge.\n\n1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:41.640\n You're picking up truth.\n\n1:25:41.640 --> 1:25:43.400\n It's just being absorbed.\n\n1:25:43.400 --> 1:25:46.180\n You're accepting it as true, but you don't know it's true.\n\n1:25:46.180 --> 1:25:51.280\n And then you go out into the world advocating for it, which we all did, or at least I did,\n\n1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:52.560\n when I was 16.\n\n1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:54.020\n And you're obnoxious.\n\n1:25:54.020 --> 1:25:58.040\n You can't prove what you're arguing for because you don't have the experience.\n\n1:25:58.040 --> 1:26:03.780\n It took me, I don't know, 10, 20 years, probably 20, to figure out that I really do think what\n\n1:26:03.780 --> 1:26:07.000\n she said was true, but I didn't know when I was 16.\n\n1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:13.960\n When I was 16, I just absorbed these ideas and accepted them, in a sense, with some connection\n\n1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:20.560\n to reality, but in a sense, on faith, at least presented it that way.\n\n1:26:20.560 --> 1:26:26.280\n And as a consequence, you come off as a detached from reality, obnoxious human being.\n\n1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:30.680\n And I think a lot of young objectivists are, and it's hard not to be, because you are.\n\n1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:32.320\n You're confronted with genius.\n\n1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:33.320\n And you're not a genius.\n\n1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:34.640\n I certainly am not a genius.\n\n1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:38.480\n And I'm confronted with just genius and have all this information in my head now.\n\n1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:41.880\n I can't articulate it.\n\n1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:42.880\n And it's hard to deal with yourself.\n\n1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:43.880\n What?\n\n1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:44.880\n There's an inside joke.\n\n1:26:44.880 --> 1:26:45.880\n No, you said I'm confronted with genius.\n\n1:26:45.880 --> 1:26:46.880\n I pointed to us.\n\n1:26:46.880 --> 1:26:47.880\n Yes.\n\n1:26:47.880 --> 1:26:48.880\n I mean, I'm confronted with you guys.\n\n1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:52.160\n I'm at an age where I know how to deal with geniuses.\n\n1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:53.600\n But there's something else.\n\n1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:56.560\n This is not why people don't like her, but there's something that the Fountainhead does,\n\n1:26:56.560 --> 1:27:01.940\n which I think is very, and I don't blame her, but it's a bad consequence.\n\n1:27:01.940 --> 1:27:05.640\n If you read the Fountainhead and you're young and you're intelligent and talented, the message\n\n1:27:05.640 --> 1:27:09.400\n at least I got, and I know I'm not alone, is you are going to think that you're going\n\n1:27:09.400 --> 1:27:14.440\n to be a pariah, that a lot of people are going to be against you, and you're basically doomed\n\n1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:17.960\n for a short period of being isolated and alone.\n\n1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:20.640\n And that may have been the case when Fountainhead was written.\n\n1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:24.480\n But I think now with the internet, and in my experience, both as a youth and someone\n\n1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:28.280\n who's a little bit older, I didn't appreciate, and you're not going to get it from that book,\n\n1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:31.540\n and you can't get it through that book because it has to have a certain narrative, how many\n\n1:27:31.540 --> 1:27:38.800\n people who are a little older are giddy when they find young talent, how inspiring it is,\n\n1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:39.800\n how exciting it is.\n\n1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:43.240\n Like when you talk to these kids who are doing things on the internet or writing or whatever\n\n1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:45.960\n achievement, you want them to flourish.\n\n1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:50.260\n You're not threatened by them as the antagonists of the Fountainhead are, and that doesn't\n\n1:27:50.260 --> 1:27:53.360\n come through in the Fountainhead because it depends on your profession, right?\n\n1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:56.640\n I mean, some of these parts of the world are better than others.\n\n1:27:56.640 --> 1:28:02.880\n If you're an artist, at least the way I conceive of art, and you want to go study art today,\n\n1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:06.680\n you're going to be pouped and look down on and so on.\n\n1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:07.680\n So yeah, I agree.\n\n1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:13.500\n I mean, in my generation, when I read Iron Man, there was no internet, and I was in Israel,\n\n1:28:13.500 --> 1:28:17.860\n so we were isolated, and there was nobody else who had shared their ideas, and you did\n\n1:28:17.860 --> 1:28:19.960\n feel that kind of isolation.\n\n1:28:19.960 --> 1:28:26.120\n But Roark gave you, to me, he didn't teach me about you're going to be isolated because\n\n1:28:26.120 --> 1:28:36.480\n partially because I wasn't, maybe I was humble, right?\n\n1:28:36.480 --> 1:28:40.480\n When I read Atlas Shrugged, I identified with Eddie Willis.\n\n1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:43.960\n When I read the Fountainhead, I didn't identify with Howard Roark.\n\n1:28:43.960 --> 1:28:46.200\n How old were you when you read the Fountainhead?\n\n1:28:46.200 --> 1:28:47.480\n So I read Atlas when I was 16.\n\n1:28:47.480 --> 1:28:52.000\n I probably read the Fountainhead when I was 16 and a half, 17, something like that.\n\n1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:53.000\n That is unfathomable crime.\n\n1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.280\n You read the Fountainhead after Atlas Shrugged?\n\n1:28:55.280 --> 1:29:00.700\n If anyone listening to this, if you read the Fountainhead after Atlas Shrugged, that is\n\n1:29:00.700 --> 1:29:01.700\n a war crime.\n\n1:29:01.700 --> 1:29:05.440\n No, for me, reading Atlas Shrugged was much more important.\n\n1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:10.240\n It is more important, but my point is, I think the Fountainhead in many ways is redundant\n\n1:29:10.240 --> 1:29:13.920\n in certain aspects if you read Atlas Shrugged first, and because the Fountainhead is such\n\n1:29:13.920 --> 1:29:17.440\n a masterful book and such a personal book.\n\n1:29:17.440 --> 1:29:18.440\n I agree with that.\n\n1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:19.440\n So ideally, you would read the Fountainhead.\n\n1:29:19.440 --> 1:29:20.440\n That's what I'm saying, yes.\n\n1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:24.020\n And here's the other thing people don't appreciate, I'm sorry to interrupt you.\n\n1:29:24.020 --> 1:29:27.600\n People think Rand's always about politics, politics, politics, politics, but the Fountainhead\n\n1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:29.000\n is not a political book at all.\n\n1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:32.040\n It's about, well, she talks about politics in Mansoul, sure.\n\n1:29:32.040 --> 1:29:36.200\n But it's about ethics, how important everyone has to have a moral code.\n\n1:29:36.200 --> 1:29:38.460\n That's the other thing why people find Rand off putting.\n\n1:29:38.460 --> 1:29:44.760\n If you have young people who now find it very important to live a moral life, who are like,\n\n1:29:44.760 --> 1:29:50.400\n what does that mean to have morality, to have ethics, to live with integrity for people\n\n1:29:50.400 --> 1:29:55.440\n who have gotten a little older, who have made these little sacrifices, who are like, I'm\n\n1:29:55.440 --> 1:29:56.800\n not going to fight at work.\n\n1:29:56.800 --> 1:29:58.560\n Do I really need to look for another job?\n\n1:29:58.560 --> 1:30:02.800\n Yeah, my wife's kind of getting annoying, but am I going to make a fight about it?\n\n1:30:02.800 --> 1:30:05.720\n These little sacrifices that they make every day.\n\n1:30:05.720 --> 1:30:06.720\n And big ones.\n\n1:30:06.720 --> 1:30:08.020\n And big ones, absolutely.\n\n1:30:08.020 --> 1:30:14.840\n So when you have someone who's forcing you to look in the mirror and say, those little\n\n1:30:14.840 --> 1:30:22.120\n sacrifices and big sacrifices you made, you did the wrong thing and you're evading that you betrayed your unconscious.\n\n1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:24.480\n That to many people, I think, is very threatening.\n\n1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:29.840\n But this is why so many people say that Ayn Rand is for 14 year old boys.\n\n1:30:29.840 --> 1:30:30.840\n Yeah, right.\n\n1:30:30.840 --> 1:30:31.840\n Right?\n\n1:30:31.840 --> 1:30:32.840\n You grow out of it.\n\n1:30:32.840 --> 1:30:37.680\n And there's a reason why it appeals to 14 as a little young, but 16, 18.\n\n1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:41.320\n It's because those are the ages where we're still open to idealism.\n\n1:30:41.320 --> 1:30:49.160\n In a positive sense, to beautiful things, to ideals, to seeking perfection, to seeking\n\n1:30:49.160 --> 1:30:50.200\n a great life.\n\n1:30:50.200 --> 1:30:53.080\n I think as you grow older, most people become cynical.\n\n1:30:53.080 --> 1:30:54.080\n They give up on their ideals.\n\n1:30:54.080 --> 1:30:55.080\n Why?\n\n1:30:55.080 --> 1:30:57.480\n Because their ideals were wrong and their ideals failed.\n\n1:30:57.480 --> 1:30:59.720\n My parents were socialists when they were young.\n\n1:30:59.720 --> 1:31:00.720\n Those ideas failed.\n\n1:31:00.720 --> 1:31:02.480\n So where do you go from socialism if your ideals fail?\n\n1:31:02.480 --> 1:31:03.480\n Cynicism.\n\n1:31:03.480 --> 1:31:04.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:04.480 --> 1:31:05.480\n Which is horrible.\n\n1:31:05.480 --> 1:31:08.060\n All adults, almost all adults out there are cynical.\n\n1:31:08.060 --> 1:31:10.600\n And that is failed idealism.\n\n1:31:10.600 --> 1:31:15.440\n When they look at the young people, they see their idealism, oh, well, I was idealistic\n\n1:31:15.440 --> 1:31:16.440\n too.\n\n1:31:16.440 --> 1:31:19.360\n And they don't question the idea, well, they're good ideals and they're bad ideals, they're\n\n1:31:19.360 --> 1:31:22.320\n right ideals and they're wrong ideals.\n\n1:31:22.320 --> 1:31:24.740\n And that's why they attribute it to youth.\n\n1:31:24.740 --> 1:31:28.960\n So it's a threat to a lot of people, a lot of people who it's too late for.\n\n1:31:28.960 --> 1:31:31.660\n For some people, it's too late to change their minds.\n\n1:31:31.660 --> 1:31:33.520\n And they know it.\n\n1:31:33.520 --> 1:31:38.840\n And they're too invested in the job, in the wife, in the compromises.\n\n1:31:38.840 --> 1:31:39.840\n In the comfort.\n\n1:31:39.840 --> 1:31:42.840\n And they're too invested in the comfort.\n\n1:31:42.840 --> 1:31:45.400\n Too invested in a compromise, too invested in a comfort.\n\n1:31:45.400 --> 1:31:47.480\n And they know that they shouldn't be.\n\n1:31:47.480 --> 1:31:49.040\n They know they should change.\n\n1:31:49.040 --> 1:31:51.120\n And these young people are challenging that.\n\n1:31:51.120 --> 1:31:53.600\n And that is really, really scary for them.\n\n1:31:53.600 --> 1:31:57.720\n And that's why they reject it without too much consideration.\n\n1:31:57.720 --> 1:32:01.480\n One of the things Rand, the working title for Fountainhead was Secondhand Lives.\n\n1:32:01.480 --> 1:32:04.480\n And Rand had two definitions of selfishness in that book.\n\n1:32:04.480 --> 1:32:08.200\n One is selfishness in the sense of my life is the most important thing.\n\n1:32:08.200 --> 1:32:09.760\n It's not the only important thing.\n\n1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:11.520\n My family would be number two friends.\n\n1:32:11.520 --> 1:32:15.480\n They certainly are extremely high values, but you can't have these secondary values\n\n1:32:15.480 --> 1:32:16.480\n without the first value.\n\n1:32:16.480 --> 1:32:17.760\n But in the context of my life, right?\n\n1:32:17.760 --> 1:32:20.040\n Because your family might not be a value, right?\n\n1:32:20.040 --> 1:32:21.040\n You might hate your parents.\n\n1:32:21.040 --> 1:32:22.040\n Sure.\n\n1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:23.520\n The point being selfishness.\n\n1:32:23.520 --> 1:32:26.760\n Then there's the other kind of selfishness, which is Peter Keating, one of the villains\n\n1:32:26.760 --> 1:32:30.400\n of the book, which is he's selfish in that he's greedy.\n\n1:32:30.400 --> 1:32:33.040\n He's looking out for number one, but he has no values.\n\n1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:34.380\n He has no sense of character.\n\n1:32:34.380 --> 1:32:36.660\n He just wants to be wealthy.\n\n1:32:36.660 --> 1:32:38.360\n He wants to have a beautiful wife.\n\n1:32:38.360 --> 1:32:39.640\n He wants to have a big house.\n\n1:32:39.640 --> 1:32:40.640\n Why?\n\n1:32:40.640 --> 1:32:43.120\n He couldn't tell you because other people have it and he wants to have it more than\n\n1:32:43.120 --> 1:32:44.120\n them.\n\n1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:45.920\n His sense of reference is other people.\n\n1:32:45.920 --> 1:32:47.560\n He's living secondhand.\n\n1:32:47.560 --> 1:32:53.080\n The problem with that is a lot of young people read Rand and when they start arguing online,\n\n1:32:53.080 --> 1:32:55.200\n they just start trying to talk like Rand.\n\n1:32:55.200 --> 1:32:58.080\n Whereas Rand would be like, be original, be an innovator.\n\n1:32:58.080 --> 1:33:02.640\n If you want to argue for objectivism in Rand's views, take her ideas, articulate them in\n\n1:33:02.640 --> 1:33:03.640\n your own way.\n\n1:33:03.640 --> 1:33:08.160\n That's a good way of showing that you understand what she thinks, but what they end up doing\n\n1:33:08.160 --> 1:33:09.720\n is just talking like her.\n\n1:33:09.720 --> 1:33:14.080\n It sounds dated and comical and that's going to be off putting because it's like Rand wouldn't\n\n1:33:14.080 --> 1:33:16.400\n expect someone else to sound like Rand.\n\n1:33:16.400 --> 1:33:18.480\n She's her own person.\n\n1:33:18.480 --> 1:33:23.920\n She of course wouldn't view Keating as selfish in any sense because, or even greedy, greed\n\n1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:24.920\n is a tricky word.\n\n1:33:24.920 --> 1:33:27.240\n Well, he was selfish in the old school sense.\n\n1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:33.400\n Yeah, he's selfish in the old, but even there, it's not as if he has some passion and he's\n\n1:33:33.400 --> 1:33:39.080\n going after passion no matter what, I'm going to light, cheat, steal.\n\n1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:42.320\n His passion is painting and he doesn't pursue his passion.\n\n1:33:42.320 --> 1:33:48.520\n He pursues what his mother wants him to pursue and he pursues money and he's completely second\n\n1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:51.680\n handed in the sense that he follows other people's values, not his own.\n\n1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:56.160\n Can we actually just backtrack and can we define some of these ideas that Ayn Rand\n\n1:33:56.160 --> 1:34:01.000\n is known for of selfishness, selfishness, egoism, egotism, greed?\n\n1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:07.600\n Those all, basically all of those words are seen as negative in society and Ayn Rand has\n\n1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:10.600\n been reclaiming in her work those words.\n\n1:34:10.600 --> 1:34:13.200\n So can you speak to what they mean?\n\n1:34:13.200 --> 1:34:20.280\n I think she's trying to, and Yaron might disagree, I think she's trying to be needlessly provocative\n\n1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:25.000\n and it's off putting and on one hand, maybe you want to be a provocateur because that\n\n1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:27.480\n gives you people like, what does this woman mean?\n\n1:34:27.480 --> 1:34:30.800\n On the other hand, many people are going to be viscerally put off.\n\n1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:37.120\n When Ayn Rand was on Donahue in 1979, he asked her explicitly, define to me the virtue of\n\n1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:40.600\n selfishness, which is the title of her collection of essays as well.\n\n1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:45.240\n And she, this is Rand, immediately says, use a different word, self esteem.\n\n1:34:45.240 --> 1:34:49.880\n And it's like, yeah, it's like, why are you championing this word, which has extremely\n\n1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:51.680\n negative connotations?\n\n1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:58.540\n Whereas if you just say, and this is thanks to her and her work, my life matters, my values\n\n1:34:58.540 --> 1:35:01.840\n matter, I'm not going to apologize for that.\n\n1:35:01.840 --> 1:35:07.560\n That is a lot less off putting than this caricature of Rand, which is I'm for, when people hear\n\n1:35:07.560 --> 1:35:11.200\n I'm for selfishness, they hear, oh, someone's bleeding out in the corner, but I want to\n\n1:35:11.200 --> 1:35:12.200\n get a Coke.\n\n1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:13.200\n That's nice.\n\n1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:14.200\n She condemned that.\n\n1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:15.880\n She says, I'm against this kind of sociopathy.\n\n1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:17.160\n That's absolutely crazy.\n\n1:35:17.160 --> 1:35:18.160\n But that word selfishness.\n\n1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:24.640\n If it goes a mistake to be provocative in this one dimension, to go and to stick with\n\n1:35:24.640 --> 1:35:25.640\n it.\n\n1:35:25.640 --> 1:35:27.120\n I mean, she's stuck with this idea of selfishness and so on.\n\n1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:31.840\n She's stuck with this term and it's, I often use terms for provocative effect.\n\n1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:32.840\n Yes, this is true.\n\n1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:36.200\n You're a master, you're a scholar of the trolling arts.\n\n1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:37.200\n Thank you, sir.\n\n1:35:37.200 --> 1:35:42.240\n But I think this is one example where the costs outweigh the benefits.\n\n1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:43.240\n And go ahead, Yaron.\n\n1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:48.200\n Yes, I'm open to that idea, but I don't think that's right.\n\n1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:55.880\n When you actually dig deeper into what people object to, they're not objecting to the word.\n\n1:35:55.880 --> 1:35:58.760\n They're objecting to the ideas.\n\n1:35:58.760 --> 1:36:03.360\n And she addresses this explicitly in The Virtue of Selfishness in the, I think, the introduction.\n\n1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:04.360\n Wait, hold on.\n\n1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:05.640\n I got to ask for clarification.\n\n1:36:05.640 --> 1:36:08.880\n You're saying they're objecting to the ideas, but when they talk about her, they're not\n\n1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:09.880\n talking about her actual ideas.\n\n1:36:09.880 --> 1:36:10.880\n They're talking about the caricature.\n\n1:36:10.880 --> 1:36:11.880\n Well, sure.\n\n1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:17.720\n But the caricature is a defense mechanism not to have to deal with the ideas, right?\n\n1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:23.640\n So they create the caricature in order to ignore the ideas and some of them do it consciously.\n\n1:36:23.640 --> 1:36:28.360\n Like when people like Krugman and others do this, they know exactly what they're doing.\n\n1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:30.400\n But Krugman is Ellsworth Tewi.\n\n1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:33.760\n Yes, he's the perfect Ellsworth Tewi.\n\n1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:35.300\n And he knows Ayn Rand.\n\n1:36:35.300 --> 1:36:36.840\n He's read Ayn Rand.\n\n1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:38.800\n And he knows she's the enemy in some sense.\n\n1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:39.800\n He knows...\n\n1:36:39.800 --> 1:36:42.440\n Check out our episode with Krugman.\n\n1:36:42.440 --> 1:36:43.440\n I think it's number 90.\n\n1:36:43.440 --> 1:36:44.440\n It was a great conversation.\n\n1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:46.960\n Didn't get as many views as me, but what are you going to do?\n\n1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:50.800\n Well, he got a Nobel Prize, so what you got?\n\n1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:52.320\n I've got a ticket to heaven.\n\n1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:53.320\n Sorry, Paul.\n\n1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:55.920\n Yasser Alford has a Nobel Prize.\n\n1:36:55.920 --> 1:37:00.880\n And Hitler was a Times Man of the Year for a few times.\n\n1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:02.480\n That really bothers me when people bring that up.\n\n1:37:02.480 --> 1:37:03.480\n Are you really...\n\n1:37:03.480 --> 1:37:04.480\n Yeah, Time of the Year...\n\n1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:05.480\n It's called a joke, Michael.\n\n1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:06.480\n It's not good.\n\n1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:07.480\n Is it?\n\n1:37:07.480 --> 1:37:09.120\n Man of the Year is not representative of good.\n\n1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:13.000\n It represents the most influential person of that year, and Hitler was.\n\n1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:14.840\n Wait, what were you upset about?\n\n1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:16.640\n When people like, well, look at Time Magazine.\n\n1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:17.800\n They called Hitler Man of the Year.\n\n1:37:17.800 --> 1:37:18.800\n They were on set.\n\n1:37:18.800 --> 1:37:19.800\n They were on set.\n\n1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:20.800\n They were on set.\n\n1:37:20.800 --> 1:37:21.800\n This guy's awesome.\n\n1:37:21.800 --> 1:37:22.800\n They said this is the guy who moved the world the most.\n\n1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:23.800\n It's not like he was Stalin.\n\n1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:24.800\n I don't go out there.\n\n1:37:24.800 --> 1:37:25.800\n Now, that's who they like.\n\n1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:26.800\n Hitler's terrible.\n\n1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:27.800\n The Stalin guy.\n\n1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:28.800\n Oh, no, no.\n\n1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:29.800\n I'm not even joking.\n\n1:37:29.800 --> 1:37:39.880\n The attitude of people between Nazism and fascism and communism is stunning.\n\n1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:43.700\n In my upcoming book, I have all the receipts how the things that they were saying about\n\n1:37:43.700 --> 1:37:49.280\n Stalin at the time are, if you look back, it's unconscionable, and these people have\n\n1:37:49.280 --> 1:37:51.680\n had no accountability in the positive direction.\n\n1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:55.520\n That's not even at the time, and we need to get back to the selfishness stuff, but it's\n\n1:37:55.520 --> 1:37:57.240\n not even at the time.\n\n1:37:57.240 --> 1:37:59.880\n I think I've told this story.\n\n1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:06.480\n I was in the green room going on John Stossel's show, and I saw a bunch of libertarians in\n\n1:38:06.480 --> 1:38:10.720\n the green room all hanging out, and this guy walks in, this young guy walks in, and somebody\n\n1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:13.320\n says to me, he's a communist.\n\n1:38:13.320 --> 1:38:15.160\n I said, what do you mean?\n\n1:38:15.160 --> 1:38:19.520\n They said, no, no, he's a card carrying member of the Communist Party.\n\n1:38:19.520 --> 1:38:20.520\n He's a communist.\n\n1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:23.480\n I said, and that's okay with you guys?\n\n1:38:23.480 --> 1:38:26.640\n They go, yeah, yeah, he's a nice guy.\n\n1:38:26.640 --> 1:38:28.680\n I'm like, no, this is not acceptable.\n\n1:38:28.680 --> 1:38:29.680\n Hold on.\n\n1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:30.680\n Let me quote Rand.\n\n1:38:30.680 --> 1:38:34.640\n Rand said she would rather talk to a philosophical Marxist, right?\n\n1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:35.640\n Did she not say this?\n\n1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:41.200\n Yeah, but this is a communist in the context of 21st century, right?\n\n1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:42.200\n So I said...\n\n1:38:42.200 --> 1:38:43.200\n But not 20th.\n\n1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:46.840\n Well, in the sense that we know exactly what, we know exactly.\n\n1:38:46.840 --> 1:38:47.840\n Yeah, yeah, that's...\n\n1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:50.840\n And this guy has the blood of 100 million people on his hands.\n\n1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:52.480\n I'm not letting him off the hook.\n\n1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:58.800\n So I engage with this guy, and literally we get into this... I'm telling him what I think\n\n1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:03.800\n of his ideas, and therefore what I think of him, and the people from the wardrobe department\n\n1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:07.560\n come out, and their chairs are put aside in this little gladiator ring.\n\n1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:12.960\n It's like the libertarians are sitting there amused, because to them it's just... I'm\n\n1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:17.240\n not going to name names, but to them it's just like, yeah, he's a communist, and I said\n\n1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:23.840\n at some point to them... I won't name names, because... I said at some point to them,\n\n1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:29.600\n if somebody walks into a room and says, I'm a Nazi, do you just treat him as, okay, let's\n\n1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:30.600\n go hang out and get some drinks?\n\n1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:31.600\n I do.\n\n1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:32.600\n I don't.\n\n1:39:32.600 --> 1:39:33.600\n I do.\n\n1:39:33.600 --> 1:39:34.720\n Because I wrote a book about this, the new write, and I did talk to Nazis, and I went\n\n1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:35.720\n to North Korea to talk to them.\n\n1:39:35.720 --> 1:39:36.720\n Yeah, because you were writing a book.\n\n1:39:36.720 --> 1:39:37.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:37.720 --> 1:39:38.720\n Right?\n\n1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:41.760\n But you're not going to hang out with a Nazi or a communist just like the regular person,\n\n1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:42.760\n right?\n\n1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:43.760\n To me, a Nazi and a communist are the same.\n\n1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:47.160\n I don't under... Okay, please explain this, because first of all, any time you have a\n\n1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:49.960\n lot of equivocation, I hate that, because I don't like equality.\n\n1:39:49.960 --> 1:39:50.960\n I think it's a bad concept.\n\n1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:51.960\n Sure.\n\n1:39:51.960 --> 1:39:53.600\n We're all sitting here as Jewish people, right?\n\n1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:56.240\n We're from the Soviet Union.\n\n1:39:56.240 --> 1:39:59.600\n To say these two things are basically the same, it's a matter of life and death for\n\n1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:00.600\n all of us.\n\n1:40:00.600 --> 1:40:01.840\n We'd be dead under Hitler.\n\n1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:04.200\n We're not doing so hot under Stalin, but we're still alive.\n\n1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:05.200\n Sure.\n\n1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:07.200\n There's some very big difference.\n\n1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:08.200\n Sure.\n\n1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:09.200\n One more thing.\n\n1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:10.200\n So within the context, they're different, right?\n\n1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:11.200\n Hold on, one more thing.\n\n1:40:11.200 --> 1:40:15.080\n There's also one very big difference in that one has a lot worse of a brand name, and the\n\n1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:17.320\n other does not, even though the other should.\n\n1:40:17.320 --> 1:40:18.320\n It's a brand.\n\n1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:19.320\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:20.320\n Yeah, so I agree.\n\n1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:23.080\n So there's a context in which I would fear Stalin more than Hitler.\n\n1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:29.560\n There's a different context in which I would fear Hitler, but as ideologies, they are equally\n\n1:40:29.560 --> 1:40:30.560\n evil.\n\n1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:31.560\n Wait, wait, but...\n\n1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:36.140\n Not the same, because the difference is between communism and fascism, but as ideologies,\n\n1:40:36.140 --> 1:40:37.140\n they're equally evil.\n\n1:40:37.140 --> 1:40:41.160\n They both view the individual as insignificant, unimportant, and they both basically want\n\n1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:42.640\n to kill any independent minded...\n\n1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:45.640\n Well, you're equating communism with Stalinism, so you're equating...\n\n1:40:45.640 --> 1:40:49.240\n No, I'm equating communism... I don't know what Stalinism is.\n\n1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:50.240\n I don't care.\n\n1:40:50.240 --> 1:40:53.840\n Stalinism is one version of communism, I'm sure there are others.\n\n1:40:53.840 --> 1:40:57.240\n Communism is an evil ideology, no matter who practices it.\n\n1:40:57.240 --> 1:41:02.720\n I don't think that's... I think that's too loose, because here's one example.\n\n1:41:02.720 --> 1:41:10.000\n The first person who went to the Soviet Union from the left and denounced it was Emma Goldman.\n\n1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:11.960\n She was an anarcho communist, right?\n\n1:41:11.960 --> 1:41:14.520\n So she went there, she got deported from the United States.\n\n1:41:14.520 --> 1:41:16.080\n She went to Lenin to his face.\n\n1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:17.560\n Hold on, let me finish.\n\n1:41:17.560 --> 1:41:19.520\n You're already dismissing what I'm saying.\n\n1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:20.520\n Me?\n\n1:41:20.520 --> 1:41:21.520\n No.\n\n1:41:21.520 --> 1:41:22.520\n Your body language, your emotions.\n\n1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:23.520\n No.\n\n1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:24.520\n Humility, yeah.\n\n1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:25.520\n Humility.\n\n1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:26.520\n History doesn't carry your feelings either.\n\n1:41:26.520 --> 1:41:29.720\n She goes to Lenin, she goes, we're supposed to be about free speech.\n\n1:41:29.720 --> 1:41:31.440\n We're supposed to be about the individual freedom.\n\n1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:32.440\n What are you doing?\n\n1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:34.600\n And he goes, free speech is a bourgeois extravagance.\n\n1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:37.180\n You can't have it during a revolution, too bad.\n\n1:41:37.180 --> 1:41:38.680\n She comes back to the West.\n\n1:41:38.680 --> 1:41:39.680\n Wait, he's right?\n\n1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:40.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:41.680\n Oh no, yeah, of course.\n\n1:41:41.680 --> 1:41:42.680\n She's more consistent with the idea.\n\n1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:43.680\n Yeah, he's more consistent.\n\n1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:44.680\n She's a compromise.\n\n1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:45.680\n Yeah, you're right.\n\n1:41:45.680 --> 1:41:50.760\n Well, she comes back to the West, the big red Emma, the big hero of the left.\n\n1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:55.160\n And she goes, you guys, this is a complete, not, she didn't say bad.\n\n1:41:55.160 --> 1:41:56.160\n She was very random.\n\n1:41:56.160 --> 1:41:57.780\n She goes, this is pure evil.\n\n1:41:57.780 --> 1:41:59.000\n This is horrifying.\n\n1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:03.000\n What they're doing to the workers, which you supposedly care about, completely oppressing.\n\n1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:08.000\n And when one person described, they go, when she got up to talk, it was a standing ovation.\n\n1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:12.860\n And when she was finished, you could hear a pin drop because she wasn't some capitalist.\n\n1:42:12.860 --> 1:42:15.760\n She wasn't some bourgeois conservative.\n\n1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:19.360\n She was as hard left for violent revolution as it gets.\n\n1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:22.880\n And so I don't think she, as a communist, is an evil person.\n\n1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:24.520\n I think she is.\n\n1:42:24.520 --> 1:42:32.240\n Because if she wasn't evading, and with Rand, and I think in reality, the essence of evil\n\n1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:37.660\n is evasion, is ignoring the facts of reality, is putting your feelings ahead of your facts.\n\n1:42:37.660 --> 1:42:42.360\n She would realize that what was going on in the Soviet Union was the inevitable consequence\n\n1:42:42.360 --> 1:42:43.360\n of her ideas.\n\n1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:44.360\n That could be just she's dumb.\n\n1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:46.420\n So she could have changed her mind.\n\n1:42:46.420 --> 1:42:50.240\n She could have, coming back to the Soviet Union, said, these ideas are wrong.\n\n1:42:50.240 --> 1:42:54.880\n I now repudiate my ideas, not just of implementation, but my ideas.\n\n1:42:54.880 --> 1:42:58.440\n And then I would have said, yeah, she had been mistaken before, and now she's confronted\n\n1:42:58.440 --> 1:42:59.440\n reality.\n\n1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:04.840\n But if she stayed a leftist, if she stayed a leftist to that extent, not just a mild leftist,\n\n1:43:04.840 --> 1:43:07.480\n then I think she's dishonest and therefore immoral.\n\n1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:08.480\n So \u2013\n\n1:43:08.480 --> 1:43:09.480\n But you're using three words identically.\n\n1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:10.880\n You're saying dishonest, immoral, and evil.\n\n1:43:10.880 --> 1:43:11.880\n And I'm \u2013\n\n1:43:11.880 --> 1:43:12.880\n Okay.\n\n1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:15.960\n So evil is more \u2013 is an extreme form of immorality, right?\n\n1:43:15.960 --> 1:43:16.960\n Sure.\n\n1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:17.960\n Of course.\n\n1:43:17.960 --> 1:43:18.960\n So okay.\n\n1:43:18.960 --> 1:43:19.960\n So she's immoral.\n\n1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:20.960\n The ideology she holds is still evil because the ideology \u2013\n\n1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:21.960\n Maybe she's delusional.\n\n1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:22.960\n She might be delusional.\n\n1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:23.960\n But delusional and evil are the same.\n\n1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:24.960\n But she can be delusional.\n\n1:43:24.960 --> 1:43:26.360\n She cannot be delusional.\n\n1:43:26.360 --> 1:43:32.360\n See, I'm willing to accept a delusion before she's gone to the Soviet Union and seen it.\n\n1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:36.880\n Once she's gone to see it, I don't think that excuse holds anymore.\n\n1:43:36.880 --> 1:43:41.120\n I think now she's being confronted and she's lying to herself about the implications of\n\n1:43:41.120 --> 1:43:42.120\n it.\n\n1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:47.560\n Logically, it's inevitable that what happens in the Soviet Union has to happen in any communist\n\n1:43:47.560 --> 1:43:48.560\n context.\n\n1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:54.000\n So to play a little bit of a devil's advocate here, is it logically inevitable?\n\n1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:58.440\n Is it \u2013 can you imagine that there is communist systems where the consequences we've seen\n\n1:43:58.440 --> 1:44:02.520\n in the 20th century are not the consequences we get?\n\n1:44:02.520 --> 1:44:07.760\n In future societies, under different conditions, under different \u2013 with the internet, different\n\n1:44:07.760 --> 1:44:09.760\n communication schemes, different set of resources.\n\n1:44:09.760 --> 1:44:11.760\n As long as human beings are what we are.\n\n1:44:11.760 --> 1:44:15.840\n Now the Borg \u2013 you remember the Borg from Star Trek or whatever the series was?\n\n1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:16.840\n Okay, nerd.\n\n1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:17.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:44:17.840 --> 1:44:18.840\n I mean \u2013\n\n1:44:18.840 --> 1:44:19.840\n Okay, okay.\n\n1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:20.840\n No.\n\n1:44:20.840 --> 1:44:21.840\n I'm a nerd.\n\n1:44:21.840 --> 1:44:22.840\n Okay.\n\n1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:23.840\n The Borg \u2013\n\n1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:25.280\n It's the highest of compliments.\n\n1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:26.280\n The Borg \u2013\n\n1:44:26.280 --> 1:44:27.280\n In this household.\n\n1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:28.280\n The Borg is the highest of lex.\n\n1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:29.280\n Now we're talking.\n\n1:44:29.280 --> 1:44:32.180\n The Borg is communist, right?\n\n1:44:32.180 --> 1:44:34.360\n The Borg is a different species.\n\n1:44:34.360 --> 1:44:35.560\n It has a different biology.\n\n1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:38.800\n It has a business \u2013 different form of consciousness.\n\n1:44:38.800 --> 1:44:43.280\n Now whether such a being could survive evolution is a question.\n\n1:44:43.280 --> 1:44:44.280\n Whether such a \u2013\n\n1:44:44.280 --> 1:44:45.280\n People are ants.\n\n1:44:45.280 --> 1:44:46.280\n They don't have to be intelligent.\n\n1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:50.680\n Yeah, but then the question is can you have free will, human cognitive cognition and be\n\n1:44:50.680 --> 1:44:51.680\n a Borg?\n\n1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:52.680\n I don't think so.\n\n1:44:52.680 --> 1:44:53.680\n But maybe.\n\n1:44:53.680 --> 1:44:54.680\n Sure.\n\n1:44:54.680 --> 1:44:55.680\n Maybe in another planet.\n\n1:44:55.680 --> 1:44:56.680\n But human beings \u2013\n\n1:44:56.680 --> 1:44:57.680\n You've got to take DMT to meet the Borg.\n\n1:44:57.680 --> 1:45:04.000\n So human beings \u2013 no, communism is anti \u2013 the reason communism is evil is it's\n\n1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:09.520\n anti reality, anti human nature, anti the individual, and therefore it is inherently\n\n1:45:09.520 --> 1:45:10.520\n evil.\n\n1:45:10.520 --> 1:45:13.360\n It cannot result in anything good coming out of it.\n\n1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:14.360\n Only bad can come of it.\n\n1:45:14.360 --> 1:45:16.920\n Do you think you could have predicted that before the 20th century?\n\n1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:18.320\n Yes, and plenty of people did.\n\n1:45:18.320 --> 1:45:19.320\n It's not \u2013\n\n1:45:19.320 --> 1:45:20.320\n You know who did?\n\n1:45:20.320 --> 1:45:21.320\n Mikhail Bakunin.\n\n1:45:21.320 --> 1:45:25.800\n Mikhail Bakunin, who was an early communist Marxist rival in 18 \u2013 this is going to be\n\n1:45:25.800 --> 1:45:31.160\n in my upcoming book \u2013 in 1860, he sat down and wrote an essay, he goes, what Marx is\n\n1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:33.200\n advocating is insane.\n\n1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:35.120\n This is going to be worse than the czar.\n\n1:45:35.120 --> 1:45:38.140\n You're talking about complete totalitarian nightmare.\n\n1:45:38.140 --> 1:45:41.600\n When you put this into practice, it's going to be something we've never seen before.\n\n1:45:41.600 --> 1:45:42.600\n It's a pure horror.\n\n1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:43.880\n Like, he was a hardcore leftist.\n\n1:45:43.880 --> 1:45:45.360\n Look, Marx predicted it, right?\n\n1:45:45.360 --> 1:45:46.360\n We talked about this.\n\n1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:47.360\n Yeah, that's true too.\n\n1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:48.360\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:50.840\n Marx at some point says certain people cannot be part of the proletariat and they have to\n\n1:45:50.840 --> 1:45:51.920\n be liquidated.\n\n1:45:51.920 --> 1:45:56.640\n So this idea of mass murder and mass killing is not new to communism, it is an inherent\n\n1:45:56.640 --> 1:45:58.240\n part of what it means.\n\n1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:00.840\n You're either proletarian or you're not.\n\n1:46:00.840 --> 1:46:04.260\n And you're \u2013 look, and in Marx, it's in Marx, right?\n\n1:46:04.260 --> 1:46:06.280\n The individual doesn't matter.\n\n1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:09.760\n Now he might matter in his utopia because he knows he's got a marketing problem.\n\n1:46:09.760 --> 1:46:13.560\n See, Marx has a marketing problem because of the fact that you have individuals.\n\n1:46:13.560 --> 1:46:17.720\n How do you convince individuals to give up their individualism, to give up the individuality?\n\n1:46:17.720 --> 1:46:20.640\n What you say is, well, we have to go through this difficult process.\n\n1:46:20.640 --> 1:46:21.640\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:46:21.640 --> 1:46:22.680\n We have to get to this utopia.\n\n1:46:22.680 --> 1:46:25.960\n And in this utopia, I mean, he's very Christian.\n\n1:46:25.960 --> 1:46:27.360\n I mean, this is the other thing about Marx.\n\n1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:28.360\n About the end time.\n\n1:46:28.360 --> 1:46:32.240\n Marx is very Christian in everything, in his morality, in his collectivism, and in the\n\n1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:33.240\n end time.\n\n1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:36.480\n The end times for Marx is going back to the Garden of Eden.\n\n1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:40.840\n The end time for Marx is you don't have to do anything.\n\n1:46:40.840 --> 1:46:43.040\n Food is just available.\n\n1:46:43.040 --> 1:46:44.560\n Wealth is just available.\n\n1:46:44.560 --> 1:46:46.280\n You can do your hobbies.\n\n1:46:46.280 --> 1:46:47.280\n You can do everything.\n\n1:46:47.280 --> 1:46:49.280\n You can do whatever you want, whatever feelings, whatever.\n\n1:46:49.280 --> 1:46:53.400\n So it's going back to a Garden of Eden perspective on human.\n\n1:46:53.400 --> 1:46:55.400\n So he knows what that is going to require.\n\n1:46:55.400 --> 1:46:58.520\n It's going to require this dictatorship of the proletarian to get there.\n\n1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:00.680\n And he never tells you how we get there.\n\n1:47:00.680 --> 1:47:01.680\n There's no game plan.\n\n1:47:01.680 --> 1:47:05.000\n There's a dictatorship, then there's utopia.\n\n1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:06.000\n It's like the underpants.\n\n1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:07.000\n Step one, dictatorship.\n\n1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:08.000\n Step two, question mark.\n\n1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:09.000\n Step three, utopia.\n\n1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:10.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:11.560\n And the question mark is where the action is, right?\n\n1:47:11.560 --> 1:47:12.560\n Annihilate.\n\n1:47:12.560 --> 1:47:15.320\n Yeah, you yada yada the important part.\n\n1:47:15.320 --> 1:47:17.520\n And people buy this garbage, right?\n\n1:47:17.520 --> 1:47:20.720\n So there's nothing of value in Marx.\n\n1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:22.040\n I mean, let me be very clear.\n\n1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:23.040\n There's nothing.\n\n1:47:23.040 --> 1:47:24.740\n He gets capitalism wrong.\n\n1:47:24.740 --> 1:47:26.560\n He gets the proletarian wrong.\n\n1:47:26.560 --> 1:47:27.780\n He gets the workers wrong.\n\n1:47:27.780 --> 1:47:31.560\n He gets the labor theory of value is wrong.\n\n1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:33.320\n There is nothing of value.\n\n1:47:33.320 --> 1:47:35.200\n There's nothing of value in communism.\n\n1:47:35.200 --> 1:47:41.200\n It is a wrong, unfitted to human nature ideology from beginning to end.\n\n1:47:41.200 --> 1:47:45.380\n The clarity with which you speak is just not something I, I don't think I have that clarity\n\n1:47:45.380 --> 1:47:46.380\n about anything.\n\n1:47:46.380 --> 1:47:50.200\n But I mean, it has to do with that thing that where everybody has something to teach you.\n\n1:47:50.200 --> 1:47:54.760\n I just feel like I've been reading Mein Kampf recently, for example, for the first time.\n\n1:47:54.760 --> 1:47:55.760\n Something to learn from Hitler?\n\n1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:57.860\n Well, there's a lot to learn from Hitler.\n\n1:47:57.860 --> 1:48:01.760\n About the nature of evil, about wrong ideas, not about anything good, not about anything\n\n1:48:01.760 --> 1:48:02.760\n positive.\n\n1:48:02.760 --> 1:48:03.760\n Oh, so yeah.\n\n1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:05.280\n So that's probably a really bad example.\n\n1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:07.720\n Why is Hitler different than Marx?\n\n1:48:07.720 --> 1:48:08.720\n That's a very good question.\n\n1:48:08.720 --> 1:48:09.720\n No, I get that.\n\n1:48:09.720 --> 1:48:11.640\n But in terms of ideas, why is Hitler different than Marx?\n\n1:48:11.640 --> 1:48:16.360\n Why do we have to assume there's something to learn from Marx, but there's nothing, but\n\n1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:19.480\n we acknowledge that there's nothing positive to learn from Hitler.\n\n1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:20.480\n Because I mean, all right.\n\n1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:23.960\n I can tell you something, in the sense that like, there's an interesting question is,\n\n1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:28.160\n how did this person get from step A to being able to implement the ideas?\n\n1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:32.680\n I know, everybody should read, anybody who's interested should read Marx, because it's\n\n1:48:32.680 --> 1:48:33.680\n really important.\n\n1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:36.460\n It's important in the history and a lot of people were influenced by it.\n\n1:48:36.460 --> 1:48:37.660\n Why was it influential?\n\n1:48:37.660 --> 1:48:40.320\n What is it that he says that appeals to people?\n\n1:48:40.320 --> 1:48:42.880\n I find it interesting to see all the parallels with Christianity.\n\n1:48:42.880 --> 1:48:46.960\n I think that's why to a large extent it appeals to people because they got to give up the\n\n1:48:46.960 --> 1:48:51.520\n unimportant part of religion and got to keep the fun parts of religion, the important parts\n\n1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:54.440\n to them of religion, the morality, for example.\n\n1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:58.720\n But no, there's not something positive to learn from everybody.\n\n1:48:58.720 --> 1:49:04.440\n In Ayn Rand's view, in your view, who was worse, Stalin or Hitler?\n\n1:49:04.440 --> 1:49:12.600\n I think worse is, this is something that I'll do a Randian sin and be evasive.\n\n1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:18.880\n It really drives me crazy when people sit down and have these competitions about like,\n\n1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:21.960\n if someone who's Jewish brings up the Holocaust and someone who's African American brings\n\n1:49:21.960 --> 1:49:27.280\n up slavery, and this is a conversation that I think is pointless and very hurtful and\n\n1:49:27.280 --> 1:49:31.280\n harmful and it is really silly and ridiculous.\n\n1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:35.040\n So it might make sense in some kind of stoner context about like you're doing the math and\n\n1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:39.100\n trying to figure out, but it's like, and yeah, you could be like, what would you rather have\n\n1:49:39.100 --> 1:49:41.360\n like this kind of cancer or full blown AIDS?\n\n1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:48.200\n In short, I mean, there's gotta be life expectancy, but these are such, I'll evade your question,\n\n1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:49.280\n reframe it.\n\n1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:54.960\n I think we understand, and a lot of this is a function of the propaganda at the time,\n\n1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:58.800\n and I'm not using the word propaganda in a negative sense, the horrors of Hitler and\n\n1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:00.160\n Nazism.\n\n1:50:00.160 --> 1:50:04.480\n I think, and one of the things I'm trying to solve with my upcoming book, there is a\n\n1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:11.720\n very poor understanding about the horrors of Stalinism and what that meant in practice.\n\n1:50:11.720 --> 1:50:16.620\n One of the reasons I wrote Dear Reader, my North Korea book, and what I was shocked and\n\n1:50:16.620 --> 1:50:22.440\n delighted by when I started writing Dear Reader, I thought to myself, look, I have very little\n\n1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:26.560\n capacity to affect change, but I can tell stories.\n\n1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:27.560\n I can write books.\n\n1:50:27.560 --> 1:50:29.400\n This is my competency.\n\n1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:33.080\n If I move the needle in America, we got it pretty good here.\n\n1:50:33.080 --> 1:50:37.880\n If I move the needle in North Korea, this could have really profound positive consequences.\n\n1:50:37.880 --> 1:50:43.120\n I set a very limited goal, and that goal is to change the conversation about North Korea,\n\n1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:51.120\n to stop it being regarded as a laughing stock and start regarding it as an existential horror.\n\n1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:54.880\n The metaphor I use always, and we brought up earlier, was the Joker, because people\n\n1:50:54.880 --> 1:50:59.160\n look at Kim Jong Un, Kim Jong Il, his father, they look at a clown disguised as a buffoon,\n\n1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:02.900\n and that's valid, and I said, this is what I can do.\n\n1:51:02.900 --> 1:51:06.960\n I can move that camera a little bit, and now that camera, instead of looking at Kim Jong\n\n1:51:06.960 --> 1:51:12.900\n Un, Kim Jong Il, you see behind him literally millions of corpses, and when you see people\n\n1:51:12.900 --> 1:51:17.360\n putting on these performances in these shows, look at these fools, then you're like, everyone\n\n1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:20.760\n those people, their kid has a gun to their head right now.\n\n1:51:20.760 --> 1:51:23.400\n If someone puts a gun to your kid's head, you're going to put on clown makeup?\n\n1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:24.460\n Yeah, you are.\n\n1:51:24.460 --> 1:51:25.460\n What color?\n\n1:51:25.460 --> 1:51:27.640\n Put on the shoes, whatever you want.\n\n1:51:27.640 --> 1:51:34.680\n So in terms of, people do not appreciate the horrors of Stalinism.\n\n1:51:34.680 --> 1:51:37.400\n I think this is a big fault of the right wing.\n\n1:51:37.400 --> 1:51:40.680\n You can't expect necessarily the New York Times to do this because of the blood on their\n\n1:51:40.680 --> 1:51:45.920\n hands, and for a long time, I was berating conservatives, I go, this was the big right\n\n1:51:45.920 --> 1:51:49.880\n wing victory, bloodless largely, the victory of the Soviet Union.\n\n1:51:49.880 --> 1:51:54.760\n No one's talking about it, no one's informing, and let's be clear, there are very many people\n\n1:51:54.760 --> 1:51:58.420\n who are Democrats who are on the left, who are violently opposed, literally violently\n\n1:51:58.420 --> 1:52:03.720\n opposed to the Soviet Union, it's horrors, this is not necessarily a partisan issue.\n\n1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:05.680\n And I'm like, all right, I'm going to do something about it.\n\n1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:10.520\n So I know that's not really literally your question, but you know, that's kind of information\n\n1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:11.520\n that feeds us.\n\n1:52:11.520 --> 1:52:13.560\n Let me ask you that question if it's okay.\n\n1:52:13.560 --> 1:52:20.880\n So what, which do we, can we learn more from, from a historical perspective looking forward?\n\n1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:27.920\n From like, which has more lessons in, in how to avoid it, how to, and just general lessons\n\n1:52:27.920 --> 1:52:28.920\n about human nature.\n\n1:52:28.920 --> 1:52:34.360\n Well, I mean, I agree with Michael that it's not important who's more evil because they're\n\n1:52:34.360 --> 1:52:39.880\n both evil and they're both just so evil that the differences don't matter.\n\n1:52:39.880 --> 1:52:44.560\n What matters is what is the ideology?\n\n1:52:44.560 --> 1:52:47.640\n What is the, what is, what are the consequences?\n\n1:52:47.640 --> 1:52:49.200\n What do we understand from it?\n\n1:52:49.200 --> 1:52:51.000\n What are we worried about?\n\n1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:52.520\n What are we going to avoid?\n\n1:52:52.520 --> 1:52:57.440\n So I'm not worried about Nazism qua Nazism because everybody hates Nazism.\n\n1:52:57.440 --> 1:53:01.320\n I mean, it's uniform that that's out.\n\n1:53:01.320 --> 1:53:06.340\n Even the people I think on the far right in America are staying away from the cliches\n\n1:53:06.340 --> 1:53:08.600\n of Nazism, although some of them are stupid enough not to.\n\n1:53:08.600 --> 1:53:13.600\n But, but in the end, if, if, if the United States goes authoritarian right, it's not\n\n1:53:13.600 --> 1:53:14.600\n going to be Nazism.\n\n1:53:14.600 --> 1:53:21.840\n It'd be some other form of fascism because that is so obviously, you know, being understood\n\n1:53:21.840 --> 1:53:28.160\n as evil and bad that there's almost no understanding that the evil of communism, I mean, you brought\n\n1:53:28.160 --> 1:53:30.840\n it up earlier, right?\n\n1:53:30.840 --> 1:53:34.840\n Almost nobody understands that communism is an evil ideology, that there's, that there's\n\n1:53:34.840 --> 1:53:41.260\n nothing worthwhile there, that any, any attempt to go in that direction in any sustainable\n\n1:53:41.260 --> 1:53:42.960\n way is destructive.\n\n1:53:42.960 --> 1:53:46.480\n They are, as you mentioned, they're economists out there claiming they are communists.\n\n1:53:46.480 --> 1:53:51.960\n I mean, I find that despicable that anybody would claim to be a communist economist or\n\n1:53:51.960 --> 1:53:57.680\n communist anything, because I think that's, it's a, it's a, it's a ideology that has\n\n1:53:57.680 --> 1:54:00.120\n no basis, but we haven't learned that.\n\n1:54:00.120 --> 1:54:06.280\n So to me, communism is the much bigger threat because we still think it's some kind of beautiful\n\n1:54:06.280 --> 1:54:11.000\n ideal in, in the world around us.\n\n1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:14.960\n I think Nazism is out, but I think, I think fascism is a, is a massive threat out there\n\n1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:19.920\n because I don't think we've learned real lessons of, nobody knows what fascism is.\n\n1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:21.440\n Everybody thinks fascism is Nazism.\n\n1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:25.480\n They don't, they don't recognize that in a sense we are already fascist and that we're\n\n1:54:25.480 --> 1:54:27.400\n certainly heading in that direction.\n\n1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:28.440\n So they don't know what it is.\n\n1:54:28.440 --> 1:54:33.040\n And again, we haven't studied, and the real lesson here is we haven't studied what unifies\n\n1:54:33.040 --> 1:54:37.240\n them both because there's not a big difference between fascism and communism.\n\n1:54:37.240 --> 1:54:39.000\n There's no big difference between Nazism and communism.\n\n1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:40.440\n What does unify them?\n\n1:54:40.440 --> 1:54:45.440\n What unifies them is the common good, the public interest.\n\n1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:50.280\n What unifies them is this idea that there is some elite group of people who can run\n\n1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:54.480\n our lives for us, for the common good, for the public interest.\n\n1:54:54.480 --> 1:54:55.480\n And that you don't matter.\n\n1:54:55.480 --> 1:55:01.400\n You as an individual, you individual don't matter and they, they will dictate how you\n\n1:55:01.400 --> 1:55:02.400\n live.\n\n1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:03.400\n And you know, so these are philosopher kings.\n\n1:55:03.400 --> 1:55:07.160\n It goes back to Plato's philosophy, but it really unifies it.\n\n1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:11.720\n Think about communism, communism is about the sacrifice of the individual to the proletarian.\n\n1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:13.200\n Who is the proletarian?\n\n1:55:13.200 --> 1:55:15.600\n It's this collective group here.\n\n1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:17.440\n Who represents a proletarian?\n\n1:55:17.440 --> 1:55:20.360\n Well they have, somebody has to, somebody has to tell the proletarian what they believe\n\n1:55:20.360 --> 1:55:23.600\n in because they don't know, because there is no collective consciousness.\n\n1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:27.760\n So you need a Stalin and this is the point about Marxism.\n\n1:55:27.760 --> 1:55:36.120\n Marxism needs a dictator because somebody has to represent the values, the public interest,\n\n1:55:36.120 --> 1:55:38.160\n what's good for the public.\n\n1:55:38.160 --> 1:55:39.200\n Nazism needs the same thing.\n\n1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:43.400\n Just Nazism replace proletarian with Aryans, the Aryan race.\n\n1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:44.620\n And you have exactly the same thing.\n\n1:55:44.620 --> 1:55:48.360\n You need a dictator to tell us what's good for the Aryan people so we can do what's good\n\n1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:49.360\n for the Aryan people.\n\n1:55:49.360 --> 1:55:53.840\n So it's impossible to have a communist system or a fascist system without a dictator naturally\n\n1:55:53.840 --> 1:55:54.840\n emerging.\n\n1:55:54.840 --> 1:55:56.400\n It's not, it's not possible to have a George.\n\n1:55:56.400 --> 1:55:57.720\n It's not naturally, it's ideologically.\n\n1:55:57.720 --> 1:56:00.400\n It's absolutely impossible to have that on scale.\n\n1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:04.520\n You can certainly have communes where people behave communistically.\n\n1:56:04.520 --> 1:56:06.200\n Because it's not inside the ideology.\n\n1:56:06.200 --> 1:56:07.200\n Hold on.\n\n1:56:07.200 --> 1:56:11.120\n Let me talk about fascism because fascism definitionally is going to have a strong man.\n\n1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:14.240\n I don't even know how it could be fascism without that.\n\n1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:18.720\n And let's talk, what you said earlier on is about how people don't know what fascism is.\n\n1:56:18.720 --> 1:56:20.300\n Fascists don't know what fascism is.\n\n1:56:20.300 --> 1:56:25.320\n So there's a superb book by John Diggins from the early seventies called Mussolini and Fascism,\n\n1:56:25.320 --> 1:56:26.580\n the view from America.\n\n1:56:26.580 --> 1:56:31.120\n So I find Mussolini to be a far more interesting figure than Hitler because he had a much more\n\n1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:32.440\n nuanced career.\n\n1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:34.160\n He was much more of an innovator.\n\n1:56:34.160 --> 1:56:35.160\n He was an intellectual.\n\n1:56:35.160 --> 1:56:39.100\n Which is shocking because he always comes across as a buffoon, but he was actually a\n\n1:56:39.100 --> 1:56:40.100\n thinker.\n\n1:56:40.100 --> 1:56:43.720\n Why did he not resist Hitler at all?\n\n1:56:43.720 --> 1:56:51.000\n So one of the things with fascism is it comes, it's a direct line from Kant to Mussolini.\n\n1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:56.600\n So basically there is a philosopher who I adore, who I'm sure you don't, called Schopenhauer.\n\n1:56:56.600 --> 1:57:02.920\n And Schopenhauer, the question became, Rand was not a particularly humorous person.\n\n1:57:02.920 --> 1:57:04.480\n She had some moments of wit.\n\n1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:09.420\n There's a great moment when she was on Tom Snyder show in 1980, I believe, and she's\n\n1:57:09.420 --> 1:57:14.720\n talking about Kant and she goes, Immanuel Kant and all his illegitimate children, if\n\n1:57:14.720 --> 1:57:17.480\n you catch my meaning, she mean all his bastards.\n\n1:57:17.480 --> 1:57:19.440\n But the host Tom Snyder did not pick up on it.\n\n1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:21.560\n If you watch it on YouTube, you could pick up on it.\n\n1:57:21.560 --> 1:57:26.520\n And what happened was once Kant bifurcated reality into the phenomenal world, the pure\n\n1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:32.540\n idea world and the numeral world, the question became, well, what is the nature of this world\n\n1:57:32.540 --> 1:57:33.640\n of ideas?\n\n1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:35.240\n And Hegel had it meant reason.\n\n1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:39.840\n I don't know even know what that means theoretically, that the world of reason is idea and this\n\n1:57:39.840 --> 1:57:45.680\n is Schopenhauer who hated Hegel, who constantly attacked him by name and Hegel's followers\n\n1:57:45.680 --> 1:57:46.880\n in his work.\n\n1:57:46.880 --> 1:57:52.160\n He was a very big innovator in a malevolent way because he said the nature of reality,\n\n1:57:52.160 --> 1:57:58.520\n this idea is will, meaning the universe doesn't care about you and it's constantly in this\n\n1:57:58.520 --> 1:58:02.720\n reality putting urges in your mind, values.\n\n1:58:02.720 --> 1:58:06.520\n And when you denounce these values and urges, that's the basis of morality.\n\n1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:12.960\n And from there it went to Nietzsche and the will isn't mindless, it is a will to power.\n\n1:58:12.960 --> 1:58:19.480\n Mussolini took this and basically said, because the will to power is the real reality, the\n\n1:58:19.480 --> 1:58:23.320\n Kantian idea, therefore all of this is secondary.\n\n1:58:23.320 --> 1:58:26.880\n So if we will it, we can make it happen.\n\n1:58:26.880 --> 1:58:32.920\n When you have this concept of my willpower is stronger than reality and you're like,\n\n1:58:32.920 --> 1:58:34.880\n okay, how's this program going to work?\n\n1:58:34.880 --> 1:58:36.480\n We can make it happen.\n\n1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:42.320\n That was why fascism is not a very coherent ideology because explicitly, there's a book\n\n1:58:42.320 --> 1:58:46.520\n called from 1936 called The Philosophy of Fascism, which tried to codify this, 36, this\n\n1:58:46.520 --> 1:58:53.020\n is a long time ago, where they're like, we're against reason and explicitly rationality.\n\n1:58:53.020 --> 1:58:59.080\n We are for willpower, for strength, and if you are strong enough and united enough, you\n\n1:58:59.080 --> 1:59:02.400\n can force these things to work.\n\n1:59:02.400 --> 1:59:06.840\n So there's a lot that is not taught about this ideology.\n\n1:59:06.840 --> 1:59:10.200\n I highly recommend people read the books from the time.\n\n1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:15.160\n And what was fascinating about Mussolini is he was regarded as the moderate.\n\n1:59:15.160 --> 1:59:21.040\n Because the 1930s, you had the Great Depression, all the intellectuals said, this proves capitalism\n\n1:59:21.040 --> 1:59:25.640\n can't work, the Great Depression, obviously, air quotes, is capitalism's fault.\n\n1:59:25.640 --> 1:59:27.400\n Then you have the alternative, the USSR.\n\n1:59:27.400 --> 1:59:29.480\n Well, that's not tenable for us.\n\n1:59:29.480 --> 1:59:34.040\n Here comes Mussolini and Mussolini says, I'm going to take the best of both worlds.\n\n1:59:34.040 --> 1:59:38.720\n I have aspects of markets, capitalism, but I don't have this chaos, but I also don't\n\n1:59:38.720 --> 1:59:41.640\n have complete government control of the bureaucrats.\n\n1:59:41.640 --> 1:59:43.920\n I'm going to have this combination.\n\n1:59:43.920 --> 1:59:47.360\n And there was a Broadway song, You're the Top, you're Mussolini.\n\n1:59:47.360 --> 1:59:50.720\n That was later edited out because that's when he took a bad turn.\n\n1:59:50.720 --> 1:59:54.600\n But this is kind of the fascist idea.\n\n1:59:54.600 --> 1:59:57.440\n And it's about power and it's about control.\n\n1:59:57.440 --> 1:59:58.440\n That's the essence.\n\n1:59:58.440 --> 1:59:59.440\n It's about will.\n\n1:59:59.440 --> 2:00:01.560\n So they don't care.\n\n2:00:01.560 --> 2:00:07.040\n Fascists don't care who owns stuff, owns in quotes, because what's important is who controls\n\n2:00:07.040 --> 2:00:08.040\n it.\n\n2:00:08.040 --> 2:00:11.760\n So you can own your home, but if I get to tell you when you can sell it, for how much\n\n2:00:11.760 --> 2:00:15.880\n you can sell it and what you can do on that home, then I'm in control of it.\n\n2:00:15.880 --> 2:00:17.280\n That's the essence of fascism.\n\n2:00:17.280 --> 2:00:22.400\n And if you think about it, we live today in a much more fascist economic context than\n\n2:00:22.400 --> 2:00:24.760\n anything else.\n\n2:00:24.760 --> 2:00:29.400\n We pretend that corporations are private, but when everything they do is regulated,\n\n2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:34.960\n who they can hire, how much they pay them, when and how they can fire them, what they\n\n2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:38.800\n can do in their property, it's all control.\n\n2:00:38.800 --> 2:00:43.280\n That's the way fascists start controlling everything.\n\n2:00:43.280 --> 2:00:47.320\n But it's not possible to have checks on power and balance of power at the top of fascism\n\n2:00:47.320 --> 2:00:48.740\n or communist systems.\n\n2:00:48.740 --> 2:00:56.400\n The question was whether in fascist systems or communist systems, we're saying the dictator\n\n2:00:56.400 --> 2:00:58.200\n naturally or must emerge.\n\n2:00:58.200 --> 2:01:02.200\n I don't say emerge, the dictator is the one who makes the fascist system.\n\n2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:08.900\n Yeah, fascism, well, it could emerge because for example, I think today in America we're\n\n2:01:08.900 --> 2:01:14.240\n moving much more towards fascism or socialism, and at some point that'll manifest itself\n\n2:01:14.240 --> 2:01:15.760\n in some kind of dictator.\n\n2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:19.280\n And the dictator might be different than a Mussolini or Nazis, it might be couched in\n\n2:01:19.280 --> 2:01:23.280\n some kind of pseudo constitutional American presence.\n\n2:01:23.280 --> 2:01:28.320\n It would be a lot easier for a female to be a fascist dictator in America than a male,\n\n2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:29.760\n because do you have that softness?\n\n2:01:29.760 --> 2:01:33.340\n She's not gonna come off as a strong woman, people won't see it coming, in my opinion.\n\n2:01:33.340 --> 2:01:41.120\n I think it's gonna be a nationalist, religionist, environmentalist, I think somebody who can\n\n2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:42.120\n combine those three.\n\n2:01:42.120 --> 2:01:43.120\n Well, Hitler did those, yeah.\n\n2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:44.120\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:01:44.120 --> 2:01:47.040\n And somebody who can combine those three and articulate the case for it, I think America\n\n2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:48.040\n is ready for it.\n\n2:01:48.040 --> 2:01:50.760\n So you think it's possible for fascism to arise in the world again?\n\n2:01:50.760 --> 2:01:54.920\n Oh, of course, it had never went away, they just adopt the name.\n\n2:01:54.920 --> 2:02:00.480\n Because the fundamental ideas, the Kantian ideas, the ideas that are behind fascism never\n\n2:02:00.480 --> 2:02:01.480\n went away.\n\n2:02:01.480 --> 2:02:05.560\n They're still as popular, if anything, more popular than they were back then, Marx is\n\n2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:06.560\n as popular.\n\n2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:12.040\n I think these ideas are prevalent, they're out there, and absolutely, I think America\n\n2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:13.040\n is ready for them.\n\n2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:17.800\n Again, it won't be quite in the form that we've experienced in the past, it'll be in\n\n2:02:17.800 --> 2:02:22.800\n a uniquely American form, couched at a flag, and of course, it was couched at a flag before.\n\n2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:28.920\n But no, yes, an authoritarian, some form of authoritarianism is necessary, because the\n\n2:02:28.920 --> 2:02:35.800\n fundamental principle behind both communism and fascism is the unimportance of the individual.\n\n2:02:35.800 --> 2:02:42.320\n The individual is nothing, the individual is a nobody, and the importance of the collective.\n\n2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:46.560\n The collective will, the collective soul, the collective consciousness, but the collective\n\n2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:49.320\n has no will, has no soul, has no consciousness.\n\n2:02:49.320 --> 2:02:55.720\n So somebody has to emerge to speak for the collective, otherwise, everything falls apart.\n\n2:02:55.720 --> 2:03:01.600\n So it's necessary, whether it's a committee or whether it's one person, how exactly, somebody\n\n2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:03.960\n has to speak for the collective.\n\n2:03:03.960 --> 2:03:06.820\n Even a committee doesn't function as a committee, right?\n\n2:03:06.820 --> 2:03:11.500\n Most committees, particularly when the committee is about dictating how people should live,\n\n2:03:11.500 --> 2:03:14.560\n somebody is going to, because now it becomes really, really important, somebody is going\n\n2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:18.880\n to dominate that committee and rule over it, because you don't want independent sources,\n\n2:03:18.880 --> 2:03:22.320\n independent voices, because the individual doesn't matter, the individual doesn't count.\n\n2:03:22.320 --> 2:03:26.080\n It's a natural hierarchical, so you have seven people that ostensibly have the same role,\n\n2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:28.640\n someone is going to emerge as a leader naturally, and some people are going to follow.\n\n2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:34.000\n Yeah, it's the same reason you cannot have the Richard Wolff type socialism of, and this\n\n2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:37.560\n is the more, if you will, innocent part of his ideas.\n\n2:03:37.560 --> 2:03:43.320\n Oh, why can't we have corporations all be worker owned, and everybody votes on everything,\n\n2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:51.920\n and we vote on who should be CEO, and no, communism, fascism, most ideas necessitate\n\n2:03:51.920 --> 2:03:55.880\n ultimately authoritarians, and that's most of human history.\n\n2:03:55.880 --> 2:03:57.260\n We forget again.\n\n2:03:57.260 --> 2:04:01.520\n This idea of liberty, this idea of freedom, even the limited freedom we have today.\n\n2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:02.520\n It's a recent invention.\n\n2:04:02.520 --> 2:04:04.240\n It's a recent invention.\n\n2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:07.080\n It happens in little pockets throughout history.\n\n2:04:07.080 --> 2:04:11.960\n We had a little bit of this democracy stuff, partial, only a few, some people got to vote\n\n2:04:11.960 --> 2:04:15.480\n and it wasn't rights respecting, because they didn't have the concept of rights in Athens,\n\n2:04:15.480 --> 2:04:16.480\n right?\n\n2:04:16.480 --> 2:04:17.480\n You had it in a few Greek cities.\n\n2:04:17.480 --> 2:04:21.140\n We maybe had a version of it in Venice, we had a version of it in city states around\n\n2:04:21.140 --> 2:04:25.960\n the world, but then it was invented by the founding fathers in this country.\n\n2:04:25.960 --> 2:04:29.680\n That's what makes the founding of America so important, and so different, and such a\n\n2:04:29.680 --> 2:04:33.000\n radical thing to have happened historically.\n\n2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:34.600\n Freedom is rare.\n\n2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:35.600\n Authoritarianism is common.\n\n2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:41.680\n So I was looking at some statistics that 53% of people in the world live under authoritarian\n\n2:04:41.680 --> 2:04:42.680\n government.\n\n2:04:42.680 --> 2:04:43.680\n Only 53.\n\n2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:49.480\n Oh, because India is democratic, so I guess they don't count India, but yes, it used to\n\n2:04:49.480 --> 2:04:50.480\n be 100.\n\n2:04:50.480 --> 2:04:51.480\n Exactly.\n\n2:04:51.480 --> 2:04:52.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:52.480 --> 2:04:53.480\n How do we change that?\n\n2:04:53.480 --> 2:04:54.480\n How do we change that?\n\n2:04:54.480 --> 2:04:59.840\n And even the authoritarianism in a country like China is a lot less than it used to be\n\n2:04:59.840 --> 2:05:01.560\n under Mao, right?\n\n2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:05.280\n So they were better off than they were under Mao.\n\n2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:06.280\n That's a reality.\n\n2:05:06.280 --> 2:05:08.200\n How do we change it?\n\n2:05:08.200 --> 2:05:12.280\n We have to declare, we have to change the ethical views of people.\n\n2:05:12.280 --> 2:05:18.600\n This brings us back to selfishness, because as long as the standard of morality is the\n\n2:05:18.600 --> 2:05:23.740\n group, others, as long as the standard of value is what other people want, what other\n\n2:05:23.740 --> 2:05:29.280\n people think, as long as you are alive only to be sacrificed to the group, that's why\n\n2:05:29.280 --> 2:05:31.800\n you have to challenge Christianity.\n\n2:05:31.800 --> 2:05:37.880\n As long as the Jesus on a cross dying for other people's sin is viewed as this noble,\n\n2:05:37.880 --> 2:05:42.560\n wonderful act instead of one of the most unjust things to ever happen to anybody, as long\n\n2:05:42.560 --> 2:05:47.560\n as the common good and the public interest are the standards by which we evaluate things,\n\n2:05:47.560 --> 2:05:52.080\n we will always drift towards fascism, some form of authoritarianism.\n\n2:05:52.080 --> 2:05:53.600\n Can I answer your question?\n\n2:05:53.600 --> 2:05:57.160\n I think there's something that has to go along with what Yaron was saying, and I know he's\n\n2:05:57.160 --> 2:05:59.980\n going to agree with me, which is technology.\n\n2:05:59.980 --> 2:06:04.720\n Because if it becomes harder technologically for the authoritarian and more expensive for\n\n2:06:04.720 --> 2:06:10.480\n him to input or force his edicts, that is going to create a pocket of freedom regardless\n\n2:06:10.480 --> 2:06:12.000\n of what the masses think.\n\n2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:15.420\n And the masses, hold on let me finish, the masses as a rule are not going to be able\n\n2:06:15.420 --> 2:06:17.320\n to think in general anyway.\n\n2:06:17.320 --> 2:06:19.680\n I have a much more elitist view of mankind than Rand does.\n\n2:06:19.680 --> 2:06:23.440\n And let me give you one specific example, which I mentioned in my book that you write.\n\n2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:28.440\n Let's suppose it's 1990, not that long ago, we all remember 1990.\n\n2:06:28.440 --> 2:06:31.000\n And we're having an argument about censorship.\n\n2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:35.640\n And Yaron says, I want full freedom of the press, freedom of books, publish whatever\n\n2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:37.640\n you want, whatever, free speech.\n\n2:06:37.640 --> 2:06:40.320\n And I say, well, what about books like Mein Kampf?\n\n2:06:40.320 --> 2:06:42.320\n What about, you know, people read this the wrong idea?\n\n2:06:42.320 --> 2:06:44.560\n What about child pornography, things like this?\n\n2:06:44.560 --> 2:06:45.800\n Like, where are you going to draw the line?\n\n2:06:45.800 --> 2:06:51.300\n And we could argue along, Lex appears from the future, and he goes, hey, guys, this conversation\n\n2:06:51.300 --> 2:06:52.300\n is moot.\n\n2:06:52.300 --> 2:06:54.320\n And we're like, Lex, you look exactly the same.\n\n2:06:54.320 --> 2:06:56.560\n I'm like, yeah, of course, Robo Stone Age.\n\n2:06:56.560 --> 2:06:58.680\n And you go, I'm from the future.\n\n2:06:58.680 --> 2:07:00.480\n And I go, wait a minute, black president?\n\n2:07:00.480 --> 2:07:06.560\n And you go, look, this conversation is moot, because in a few years from now, you will\n\n2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:11.720\n be able to send any book anywhere on earth at the speed of light.\n\n2:07:11.720 --> 2:07:15.880\n You can make infinite copies in one second.\n\n2:07:15.880 --> 2:07:19.880\n And you could send it to anyone such that they can only open this book if they know\n\n2:07:19.880 --> 2:07:21.480\n a magic word.\n\n2:07:21.480 --> 2:07:23.120\n And I go, well, how much is this going to cost?\n\n2:07:23.120 --> 2:07:24.120\n Oh, it's free.\n\n2:07:24.120 --> 2:07:29.740\n And I go, wait, wait, you're telling me I can make infinite copies of any book and teleport\n\n2:07:29.740 --> 2:07:32.800\n them at the speed of light anywhere for free?\n\n2:07:32.800 --> 2:07:35.240\n And you would say, yes, we would think he's insane.\n\n2:07:35.240 --> 2:07:37.140\n But that's the status quo, right?\n\n2:07:37.140 --> 2:07:44.240\n So technology has done far more to fight government censorship of literature and ideas than has\n\n2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:46.160\n spreading the right ideas.\n\n2:07:46.160 --> 2:07:50.440\n So when you have things like crypto, which makes money less accessible than a gold block\n\n2:07:50.440 --> 2:07:55.560\n in your house, when you have things like people being able to travel quickly, those are also\n\n2:07:55.560 --> 2:07:59.520\n necessary compliments to having the right ideas.\n\n2:07:59.520 --> 2:08:03.920\n And Rand herself said that she couldn't have come up with her philosophy before the Industrial\n\n2:08:03.920 --> 2:08:04.960\n Revolution.\n\n2:08:04.960 --> 2:08:09.880\n So as time goes forward and we have more technology and we have more discourse.\n\n2:08:09.880 --> 2:08:12.280\n But for very different reasons, she said that, right?\n\n2:08:12.280 --> 2:08:16.320\n But it's also a lot easier to persuade people the right ideas.\n\n2:08:16.320 --> 2:08:18.600\n So I kind of agree.\n\n2:08:18.600 --> 2:08:22.920\n Maybe I'm more pessimistic or maybe I don't get the technology completely.\n\n2:08:22.920 --> 2:08:23.920\n That's because you're a boomer.\n\n2:08:23.920 --> 2:08:24.920\n There you go.\n\n2:08:24.920 --> 2:08:25.920\n Okay, boomer.\n\n2:08:25.920 --> 2:08:30.360\n I get that insult a lot.\n\n2:08:30.360 --> 2:08:32.520\n I think I'm the last year of the boomer generation.\n\n2:08:32.520 --> 2:08:33.520\n It's a mindset.\n\n2:08:33.520 --> 2:08:34.520\n I think I hit that last.\n\n2:08:34.520 --> 2:08:35.520\n It's a mindset.\n\n2:08:35.520 --> 2:08:36.520\n There you go.\n\n2:08:36.520 --> 2:08:38.640\n I love you so much.\n\n2:08:38.640 --> 2:08:43.600\n So the reason she said she couldn't have developed her, the reason she said she couldn't develop\n\n2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:52.120\n the philosophy without the Industrial Revolution is the link between reason and wealth was not\n\n2:08:52.120 --> 2:08:54.200\n obvious before the Industrial Revolution.\n\n2:08:54.200 --> 2:08:56.960\n And that, for example, it's not obvious to Aristotle.\n\n2:08:56.960 --> 2:09:00.400\n Aristotle doesn't see the link between rationality and wealth creation.\n\n2:09:00.400 --> 2:09:03.240\n Business is low.\n\n2:09:03.240 --> 2:09:10.480\n And money is barren, interest has no productive function, bankers don't have.\n\n2:09:10.480 --> 2:09:18.080\n So you had to see it existentially to be able to see reason is the source of wealth creation.\n\n2:09:18.080 --> 2:09:20.080\n So I think that's a little different.\n\n2:09:20.080 --> 2:09:25.760\n Now, there is a sense in which, yes, technology makes it more difficult for authoritarians\n\n2:09:25.760 --> 2:09:29.360\n to achieve their authoritarianism.\n\n2:09:29.360 --> 2:09:31.160\n I'm not convinced that they can't.\n\n2:09:31.160 --> 2:09:32.160\n I didn't say can't.\n\n2:09:32.160 --> 2:09:33.160\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:36.440\n At a certain point, because they can turn off the electricity.\n\n2:09:36.440 --> 2:09:38.160\n I'm just saying it becomes more expensive.\n\n2:09:38.160 --> 2:09:40.180\n It becomes more expensive, no question.\n\n2:09:40.180 --> 2:09:41.440\n It becomes more expensive.\n\n2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:48.400\n And we're still beings that live in a physical reality, therefore, they can still harm us\n\n2:09:48.400 --> 2:09:49.760\n in this physical reality.\n\n2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:52.480\n But let me say this, it's going to sound as absurd.\n\n2:09:52.480 --> 2:09:56.040\n If there was technology that we could teleport anywhere on Earth at the speed of light, that\n\n2:09:56.040 --> 2:09:59.440\n would certainly go a long way towards hurting authoritarianism.\n\n2:09:59.440 --> 2:10:03.320\n If there was some way to go, and of course, they could teleport too.\n\n2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:08.080\n And this is, of course, the danger of they can use the technology too, and look at what\n\n2:10:08.080 --> 2:10:13.520\n the Chinese are doing with social scores and with monitoring people and cameras everywhere.\n\n2:10:13.520 --> 2:10:18.960\n So there's a sense in which you probably had more privacy before some of this technology.\n\n2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:21.100\n So it's not obvious to me.\n\n2:10:21.100 --> 2:10:23.280\n So to me, it's all about ideas.\n\n2:10:23.280 --> 2:10:28.080\n And if we don't get the ideas right, technology will be used for evil, yes, and it will allow\n\n2:10:28.080 --> 2:10:33.920\n some of us maybe to escape for a little while in some realms, but others not.\n\n2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:39.280\n You know, Iran and North Korea do a pretty good job shutting themselves away from technology,\n\n2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:43.840\n although a lot gets through in the Iranian, at least with Iran.\n\n2:10:43.840 --> 2:10:45.840\n I don't know about North Korea, how much gets through.\n\n2:10:45.840 --> 2:10:47.640\n It's really undermining them, which is wonderful.\n\n2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:49.620\n Yeah, which is great.\n\n2:10:49.620 --> 2:10:51.880\n So yes, but it's more than that.\n\n2:10:51.880 --> 2:10:54.640\n And this is what leads me to be optimistic.\n\n2:10:54.640 --> 2:11:00.920\n It's that we live in a world today where 7 billion people basically have access to all\n\n2:11:00.920 --> 2:11:04.400\n of human knowledge, all of human knowledge.\n\n2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:05.960\n It's not like in Rome.\n\n2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:08.560\n When Rome fell, all of human knowledge disappeared.\n\n2:11:08.560 --> 2:11:12.260\n Now some of it escaped to Byzantine, some of the Byzantines had and ultimately land\n\n2:11:12.260 --> 2:11:16.320\n up with the Arabs and found its way back into Western civilization through them.\n\n2:11:16.320 --> 2:11:19.220\n But a lot of knowledge disappeared, just wiped out, right?\n\n2:11:19.220 --> 2:11:22.160\n How to build a dome, how to build a big dome, how to have...\n\n2:11:22.160 --> 2:11:26.440\n You know, in Pompeii, they had faucets, running water and faucets.\n\n2:11:26.440 --> 2:11:30.840\n They didn't have faucets for another thousand years, right?\n\n2:11:30.840 --> 2:11:31.840\n A lot of...\n\n2:11:31.840 --> 2:11:34.600\n They couldn't build tall buildings once Rome came down.\n\n2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:39.400\n The Great Pyramid of Egypt was the tallest building on earth till like 1840, it was crazy.\n\n2:11:39.400 --> 2:11:41.600\n Rome was a city of a million people.\n\n2:11:41.600 --> 2:11:45.440\n Other than China, there wasn't another city of a million people in the West until London\n\n2:11:45.440 --> 2:11:48.680\n in the 19th century, 1500 years later.\n\n2:11:48.680 --> 2:11:53.020\n So it all disappeared because all of it was concentrated basically in one place.\n\n2:11:53.020 --> 2:11:58.040\n Today none of that exists because of the internet, because of universities everywhere, institutions.\n\n2:11:58.040 --> 2:12:01.400\n I mean, think about how many engineers there are in the world today, right?\n\n2:12:01.400 --> 2:12:04.320\n Who have basically all different...\n\n2:12:04.320 --> 2:12:06.840\n Basically the same level of knowledge on how to build stuff.\n\n2:12:06.840 --> 2:12:10.840\n So even if the United States went to some kind of dark ages, it's unlikely the whole\n\n2:12:10.840 --> 2:12:12.900\n world goes into that kind of dark ages.\n\n2:12:12.900 --> 2:12:19.840\n So I am optimistic in that sense that the fusion of knowledge is so broad today that\n\n2:12:19.840 --> 2:12:24.560\n other than wiping out all electricity on the planet, everything electronic on the planet,\n\n2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:27.200\n it's just, it's not going to be possible to control us all.\n\n2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:31.500\n And in that sense, technology is going to make it possible for us to survive and to\n\n2:12:31.500 --> 2:12:35.440\n stay semi free, because I don't think full freedom, but semi free.\n\n2:12:35.440 --> 2:12:37.220\n Because full freedom, you need the ideas.\n\n2:12:37.220 --> 2:12:39.640\n Because full freedom means you need some political implementation.\n\n2:12:39.640 --> 2:12:42.560\n No, full freedom means anarchy, but we know that.\n\n2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:47.560\n So we need to get into that because we can't leave without pointing out that we fundamentally\n\n2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:48.560\n disagree about that.\n\n2:12:48.560 --> 2:12:52.640\n Oh, that's beautiful to be continued on that one.\n\n2:12:52.640 --> 2:12:57.420\n Let me ask about one particular technology that I've been learning a lot about, thinking\n\n2:12:57.420 --> 2:13:02.080\n a lot about, talking about, which is Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general, but Bitcoin\n\n2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:11.480\n specifically, which a lot of people argue that the Bitcoin, that setting ideas aside,\n\n2:13:11.480 --> 2:13:16.320\n when you look at practical tools that governments use to manipulate its people is inflation\n\n2:13:16.320 --> 2:13:19.600\n of the monetary system, within the monetary system.\n\n2:13:19.600 --> 2:13:26.100\n And so they see Bitcoin as a way for the, for individuals to fight that, to go outside\n\n2:13:26.100 --> 2:13:33.300\n those specific government control systems and thereby sort of decentralizing power.\n\n2:13:33.300 --> 2:13:37.060\n You know, there's a case to be made historically of the 20th century that you couldn't have\n\n2:13:37.060 --> 2:13:41.560\n Stalin, you couldn't have Hitler, you couldn't have much of the evil that you see in the\n\n2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:43.800\n world if they couldn't control the monetary system.\n\n2:13:43.800 --> 2:13:45.200\n You couldn't have had the New Deal.\n\n2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:46.920\n And FDR realized this very quickly.\n\n2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:49.360\n That's why they confiscated all the gold.\n\n2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:53.860\n Everybody knows FDR is going to come in to become president and confiscate the gold.\n\n2:13:53.860 --> 2:14:00.960\n So one of the mythologies, the myths about the Great Depression is that there were all\n\n2:14:00.960 --> 2:14:07.080\n these bank runs that, well, bank runs happened because everybody was afraid that FDR would\n\n2:14:07.080 --> 2:14:08.600\n get elected to confiscate the gold.\n\n2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:11.280\n So everybody ran to the bank and took the gold.\n\n2:14:11.280 --> 2:14:15.520\n Little did they realize that he would confiscate their private holdings in their own backyards.\n\n2:14:15.520 --> 2:14:18.240\n He would force them to dig up the gold from their own backyards.\n\n2:14:18.240 --> 2:14:22.040\n But yes, one of the first things FDR did in spite of denying it throughout the campaign,\n\n2:14:22.040 --> 2:14:25.600\n right, he was asked about this over and over again and denied it.\n\n2:14:25.600 --> 2:14:29.960\n One of the first things was take over the gold and take the United States Federal Reserve\n\n2:14:29.960 --> 2:14:34.800\n off the gold standard so that they can, in a sense, print money and that he could start\n\n2:14:34.800 --> 2:14:35.800\n spending.\n\n2:14:35.800 --> 2:14:39.720\n Yeah, what people don't realize, just to clarify what Yaron said, is FDR, this is something\n\n2:14:39.720 --> 2:14:42.920\n that's so crazy to us that we think, okay, I'm misunderstanding it.\n\n2:14:42.920 --> 2:14:48.600\n FDR made it illegal for people to own gold unless it's like a wedding ring.\n\n2:14:48.600 --> 2:14:54.600\n And before that, contracts, because inflation was a concern, I make a contract with Yaron,\n\n2:14:54.600 --> 2:14:59.800\n right, I said, okay, you're either going to pay me in $1,500 for my work or the gold\n\n2:14:59.800 --> 2:15:05.760\n equivalent because if that $1,500, you know, weimar Germany and you have hyperinflation,\n\n2:15:05.760 --> 2:15:07.280\n I don't want that $1,500.\n\n2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:08.800\n Just give me the gold bullion.\n\n2:15:08.800 --> 2:15:15.280\n And FDR said all of those clauses, he broke every contract, they don't matter.\n\n2:15:15.280 --> 2:15:20.280\n So now if I say, Yaron says, okay, you owe me three feet of drywall.\n\n2:15:20.280 --> 2:15:22.180\n And I go, here's three feet of drywall.\n\n2:15:22.180 --> 2:15:23.180\n It's 12 inches.\n\n2:15:23.180 --> 2:15:25.360\n And you go, wait, wait, wait, three feet is 36 inches.\n\n2:15:25.360 --> 2:15:26.360\n I go, no, no, not anymore.\n\n2:15:26.360 --> 2:15:28.000\n It's like, what am I supposed to do?\n\n2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:32.780\n And because you have, when you print more money, the value of every individual dollar\n\n2:15:32.780 --> 2:15:38.600\n matters less, it becomes that much harder to plan anything, either in the government\n\n2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:43.540\n level or in the private level, because if I'm managing outlays, if I'm trying to pay\n\n2:15:43.540 --> 2:15:47.160\n my workers, I'm trying to build factories, I'm thinking long term, and I don't know what\n\n2:15:47.160 --> 2:15:52.400\n this dollar is going to buy in 10 years, that puts an enormous incentive for me to spend\n\n2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:56.720\n it now and not save it, because if I save it, it's going to be worth a lot less.\n\n2:15:56.720 --> 2:16:00.400\n And the worst thing about inflation, and this is something I think people who are pro capitalism\n\n2:16:00.400 --> 2:16:04.020\n don't talk about enough, they do talk about it, I would just like to see it more.\n\n2:16:04.020 --> 2:16:09.140\n This by far hurts the poor, the poorest of the poor the most.\n\n2:16:09.140 --> 2:16:14.160\n When we came to this country, my mom told me they would go to 86th street in Bensonhurst\n\n2:16:14.160 --> 2:16:17.480\n with the fruit stands to buy Mika Chika, some grapes.\n\n2:16:17.480 --> 2:16:21.120\n And you go to this fruit stand, and she'd walk all the way to the other corner.\n\n2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:25.200\n And if it was three cents more a pound, or less a pound, she'd walk all the way back,\n\n2:16:25.200 --> 2:16:26.760\n because that three cents mattered.\n\n2:16:26.760 --> 2:16:32.860\n Now if I have this dollar, and it's 5% inflation or whatever, and next year it's 95 cents,\n\n2:16:32.860 --> 2:16:37.480\n me and you, the three of us might not care, but if I'm destitute hand to mouth, and I've\n\n2:16:37.480 --> 2:16:42.720\n got 5% less, that is really a material consequence of my life.\n\n2:16:42.720 --> 2:16:48.440\n So inflation really is evil, because it hurts the people for who those pennies matter.\n\n2:16:48.440 --> 2:16:52.160\n Well, one of the ways the government gets around that, and it's because they get smart\n\n2:16:52.160 --> 2:16:57.820\n to that, is they index everything, so they index your social security, they index welfare,\n\n2:16:57.820 --> 2:17:01.880\n they try to make sure, but that only makes you more dependent on them.\n\n2:17:01.880 --> 2:17:07.120\n And the people in the modern context that inflation hurts the most are savers, people\n\n2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:08.400\n trying to save money.\n\n2:17:08.400 --> 2:17:14.440\n And Fed policy right now is just horrific if you're a saver, because the Fed, the interest\n\n2:17:14.440 --> 2:17:19.640\n rates are zero, you get nothing on your saving, and cost of living is going up, maybe not\n\n2:17:19.640 --> 2:17:26.960\n at a huge level, but it is going up, and yet you can't even save to keep the value of your\n\n2:17:26.960 --> 2:17:27.960\n dollars.\n\n2:17:27.960 --> 2:17:33.360\n And the government controls, and this has massive perverse effects, because it's not\n\n2:17:33.360 --> 2:17:38.480\n just that prices go up, it's that prices don't reflect reality anymore.\n\n2:17:38.480 --> 2:17:41.760\n So some prices go up, some prices might not.\n\n2:17:41.760 --> 2:17:45.980\n Investments get distorted, things get produced that shouldn't get produced, and then people\n\n2:17:45.980 --> 2:17:50.160\n like Richard Wolff turn around and blame all the distortions, and the perversions, and\n\n2:17:50.160 --> 2:17:53.600\n the crashes, and the financial crisis on capitalism.\n\n2:17:53.600 --> 2:17:57.560\n Not on the fact that the Fed, look at the financial crisis, financial crisis was caused,\n\n2:17:57.560 --> 2:18:01.600\n you could argue by inflation, and we could get into that if you wanted, but that's probably\n\n2:18:01.600 --> 2:18:03.680\n a three hour show, just that, right?\n\n2:18:03.680 --> 2:18:07.680\n It was caused by the Federal Reserve, and yet who got blamed for the financial crisis?\n\n2:18:07.680 --> 2:18:09.800\n Who would Richard Wolff is going to jump up and down?\n\n2:18:09.800 --> 2:18:13.680\n This is a crisis of capitalism, this was caused by capitalism, but capitalism is the negation\n\n2:18:13.680 --> 2:18:15.680\n of the Fed.\n\n2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:18.280\n Capitalism says there should be no Fed.\n\n2:18:18.280 --> 2:18:24.840\n That's item number one on the list of the things capitalists want, is to get rid of\n\n2:18:24.840 --> 2:18:29.120\n the Fed, and then grant you guys your wish, have competition for currency, and let's see\n\n2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:30.120\n if Bitcoin wins.\n\n2:18:30.120 --> 2:18:32.440\n I'm skeptical, but I don't care.\n\n2:18:32.440 --> 2:18:34.000\n My point is under freedom.\n\n2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:39.640\n I don't care who wins, I just want free choices, and let the best currency win.\n\n2:18:39.640 --> 2:18:43.200\n I doubt that becomes Bitcoin, but it doesn't really matter.\n\n2:18:43.200 --> 2:18:44.200\n If I'm wrong, great.\n\n2:18:44.200 --> 2:18:49.560\n Let me add to this, and I think people appreciate, and this is a leftist, leftism at its best,\n\n2:18:49.560 --> 2:18:51.620\n that the government and the banks are in bed with each other.\n\n2:18:51.620 --> 2:18:53.440\n This I don't think is a particularly controversial statement.\n\n2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:56.400\n Well I don't like that statement, let me just say why I don't like it.\n\n2:18:56.400 --> 2:19:00.480\n I don't like it because it assumes that they're equal partners, or that there's causality\n\n2:19:00.480 --> 2:19:02.800\n goes in both directions.\n\n2:19:02.800 --> 2:19:07.720\n From day one, and this is really from day one of the establishment of the United States,\n\n2:19:07.720 --> 2:19:12.280\n banks have been regulated by the state, and the reason for that is primarily Jefferson\n\n2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:16.520\n and others, founders, distrust of finance.\n\n2:19:16.520 --> 2:19:20.520\n So from the beginning, banks have been controlled by the state.\n\n2:19:20.520 --> 2:19:25.600\n Now over time, if I'm controlling you, you won't have influence over me, because I get\n\n2:19:25.600 --> 2:19:31.080\n to, so yes, they get into bed over time, so I don't like it that they're in bed together.\n\n2:19:31.080 --> 2:19:34.640\n One is dominating over the other, and the other is participating, because what choice\n\n2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:35.640\n do they have?\n\n2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:40.320\n I should explain to you how things work when you get in bed, and it's not always equal.\n\n2:19:40.320 --> 2:19:46.880\n Okay, so let's talk about safe words, which is very Randian topic, she doesn't like those.\n\n2:19:46.880 --> 2:19:49.880\n I had to read that scene three times in the Fountainhead, because I couldn't believe what\n\n2:19:49.880 --> 2:19:50.880\n I was reading.\n\n2:19:50.880 --> 2:19:51.880\n I'm sure you did.\n\n2:19:51.880 --> 2:19:52.880\n I'm sure you did.\n\n2:19:52.880 --> 2:19:55.920\n No, because I looked at the back cover, I'm like, a woman wrote this book in 1943, I\n\n2:19:55.920 --> 2:19:57.400\n must be misunderstanding the scene.\n\n2:19:57.400 --> 2:19:58.400\n And it's 43.\n\n2:19:58.400 --> 2:19:59.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:19:59.400 --> 2:20:00.400\n She sure had a lot of shades of gray.\n\n2:20:00.400 --> 2:20:01.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:20:01.400 --> 2:20:02.400\n So, no, she hated that.\n\n2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:03.400\n She hated that.\n\n2:20:03.400 --> 2:20:04.400\n Only black and white.\n\n2:20:04.400 --> 2:20:09.520\n No, but what I meant is, 2008, you have the bailout of Wall Street.\n\n2:20:09.520 --> 2:20:14.280\n Whereas in 2020, we saw every medium and small business under the sun go under, there's not\n\n2:20:14.280 --> 2:20:17.240\n even a pretense that these are going to be bailed out.\n\n2:20:17.240 --> 2:20:21.120\n So the priorities of the politicians, in my view, are always going to be towards powerful\n\n2:20:21.120 --> 2:20:24.880\n entities, powerful corporations, and they're not going to be about the medium guy, the\n\n2:20:24.880 --> 2:20:25.880\n middle guy.\n\n2:20:25.880 --> 2:20:29.520\n Let me just finish my point, because I see you champing at the bit.\n\n2:20:29.520 --> 2:20:33.780\n At the very least, if you have regulation, people influencing each other.\n\n2:20:33.780 --> 2:20:38.280\n With Bitcoin, and with crypto, that is not a possibility.\n\n2:20:38.280 --> 2:20:44.960\n You do not have any agency who is king of Bitcoin, who is the Federal Reserve of Bitcoin.\n\n2:20:44.960 --> 2:20:48.840\n There is no organizing organization or management team.\n\n2:20:48.840 --> 2:20:53.880\n Now, you could say this is a bad thing, but you can't say that this is a different thing\n\n2:20:53.880 --> 2:20:55.800\n to money as opposed to Federal Reserve system.\n\n2:20:55.800 --> 2:20:56.800\n Yeah.\n\n2:20:56.800 --> 2:21:01.480\n So I agree with that description of Bitcoin, my problems with Bitcoin, elsewhere.\n\n2:21:01.480 --> 2:21:07.400\n Let me just say about the financial crisis, I don't like it phrased that way again.\n\n2:21:07.400 --> 2:21:11.660\n They let Lehman go under and destroyed Lehman Brothers.\n\n2:21:11.660 --> 2:21:17.840\n In the past, they destroyed Drexel Burnham because they didn't like Michael Malkin.\n\n2:21:17.840 --> 2:21:19.840\n They are vindictive.\n\n2:21:19.840 --> 2:21:25.540\n It's not an accident that the Treasury Secretary at the time was an ex chairman of Goldman\n\n2:21:25.540 --> 2:21:29.120\n Sachs, not Lehman Brothers, and Goldman hates Lehman.\n\n2:21:29.120 --> 2:21:32.500\n The next day, they bail out AIG.\n\n2:21:32.500 --> 2:21:36.000\n What I got out of financial crisis more than anything, and by the way, there wasn't a bailout,\n\n2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:41.880\n it wasn't even a bailout, because they gave money to every bank, whether they had problems\n\n2:21:41.880 --> 2:21:42.880\n or not.\n\n2:21:42.880 --> 2:21:43.880\n Okay.\n\n2:21:43.880 --> 2:21:48.240\n And indeed, I know several bankers, including big banks, like JP Morgan and Wes Falgo, and\n\n2:21:48.240 --> 2:21:53.460\n a friend of mine, John Allison of BB&T, who told them explicitly, we don't want your money,\n\n2:21:53.460 --> 2:21:57.720\n we don't need your money, and they were basically, a gun was put to their head and they said,\n\n2:21:57.720 --> 2:22:02.320\n you don't take the money, we'll shut you down, basically, the equivalent of that.\n\n2:22:02.320 --> 2:22:09.000\n So they, A, wanted a virtue signal, so there's a big virtue signal, we're taking care of\n\n2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:12.360\n things, don't worry, we've got everything under control, even though they were completely\n\n2:22:12.360 --> 2:22:16.320\n panicking and they had no clue what they were doing.\n\n2:22:16.320 --> 2:22:23.560\n One of the things that the financial crisis really illustrated was how pathetic, ignorant,\n\n2:22:23.560 --> 2:22:27.400\n and incompetent the people at the top are, and they knew it.\n\n2:22:27.400 --> 2:22:31.640\n And they, you know, Sir Paulson goes to Congress, says, give me $700 billion, don't tell me\n\n2:22:31.640 --> 2:22:35.480\n how to use it, because I have no clue, just give it to me and give me your authoritarian\n\n2:22:35.480 --> 2:22:37.080\n power to do it any way I want.\n\n2:22:37.080 --> 2:22:41.560\n And that was not out of a sense of grandeur, that was a sense of panic, he had no idea,\n\n2:22:41.560 --> 2:22:44.740\n he had no clue, none of them did.\n\n2:22:44.740 --> 2:22:50.520\n They bailed out everybody they could, everybody under their, you know, within their periphery,\n\n2:22:50.520 --> 2:22:55.120\n when they thought it was appropriate, they were vindictive about some people like Lehman,\n\n2:22:55.120 --> 2:22:58.560\n it was complete arbitrary use of power.\n\n2:22:58.560 --> 2:23:02.760\n The bankers didn't benefit from this, indeed, many bankers that took their money lost from\n\n2:23:02.760 --> 2:23:03.760\n it.\n\n2:23:03.760 --> 2:23:06.520\n Bank stocks got crushed after the bailout.\n\n2:23:06.520 --> 2:23:10.680\n Before the bailout, bank stocks were doing okay, and right after top was announced, bank\n\n2:23:10.680 --> 2:23:15.480\n stocks crushed because this was bad for banks, it wasn't good for banks.\n\n2:23:15.480 --> 2:23:22.360\n This is just central planning gone amok, it's not them bailing out elites, it's them, you\n\n2:23:22.360 --> 2:23:26.760\n know, throwing money at a problem without knowing what they would actually do and what\n\n2:23:26.760 --> 2:23:27.920\n the consequences would be.\n\n2:23:27.920 --> 2:23:28.920\n Right.\n\n2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:34.280\n But the point is, sorry, where we agree, the focus will always be on bailing out elites.\n\n2:23:34.280 --> 2:23:35.280\n It's almost...\n\n2:23:35.280 --> 2:23:36.280\n But little banks got money too.\n\n2:23:36.280 --> 2:23:41.160\n No, I was saying that last year, there's no talk of saving ice and vice, saving Century\n\n2:23:41.160 --> 2:23:43.160\n 21, saving all these other industries.\n\n2:23:43.160 --> 2:23:47.400\n But sure there were, if you look at it, it's just, sure there was, if you look at the,\n\n2:23:47.400 --> 2:23:53.440\n if you look at what the Fed did, the Fed was bailing out third, fourth class businesses\n\n2:23:53.440 --> 2:23:59.480\n in all kinds of areas that you wouldn't consider elitist areas, the whole PPP, the way...\n\n2:23:59.480 --> 2:24:00.480\n You're talking 2008.\n\n2:24:00.480 --> 2:24:01.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:24:01.480 --> 2:24:02.480\n No, I'm talking about now.\n\n2:24:02.480 --> 2:24:03.480\n Okay.\n\n2:24:03.480 --> 2:24:04.480\n I'm talking about COVID last year.\n\n2:24:04.480 --> 2:24:08.840\n What the Fed did was unbelievable, the kind of bonds that they were buying, even 2008,\n\n2:24:08.840 --> 2:24:11.440\n even after 2008, I couldn't believe what they did last year.\n\n2:24:11.440 --> 2:24:18.040\n PPP, the Payable Protection Program was targeted at everybody, everybody got PPP.\n\n2:24:18.040 --> 2:24:19.040\n It's not about...\n\n2:24:19.040 --> 2:24:22.960\n I don't think it's about bailing out elites, it's about securing their power base.\n\n2:24:22.960 --> 2:24:25.960\n And if they believe that securing their power base is Wall Street, then they'll bail out\n\n2:24:25.960 --> 2:24:26.960\n Wall Street.\n\n2:24:26.960 --> 2:24:31.640\n They believe securing their power base is writing checks to restaurant owners all over\n\n2:24:31.640 --> 2:24:34.400\n the country, they'll write checks to restaurant owners all over the country, which is what\n\n2:24:34.400 --> 2:24:36.540\n they did with PPP.\n\n2:24:36.540 --> 2:24:40.520\n It's all about power for them and it's whatever will achieve power, whatever will result in\n\n2:24:40.520 --> 2:24:41.520\n power.\n\n2:24:41.520 --> 2:24:42.520\n I don't think it's about elites.\n\n2:24:42.520 --> 2:24:46.680\n I don't see elitism in the bailouts of last year.\n\n2:24:46.680 --> 2:24:47.680\n I agree.\n\n2:24:47.680 --> 2:24:48.680\n I agree it wasn't last year.\n\n2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:50.800\n I'm saying that's one distinction between 2008 and 2020.\n\n2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:56.120\n And I do think, just one more thing, I do think getting in good bed with the elites\n\n2:24:56.120 --> 2:24:59.200\n is a great mechanism in general for maintaining one's power.\n\n2:24:59.200 --> 2:25:00.200\n Oh yeah.\n\n2:25:00.200 --> 2:25:01.200\n Yeah, that's not a dispute.\n\n2:25:01.200 --> 2:25:02.200\n Depending on how we define it.\n\n2:25:02.200 --> 2:25:03.200\n Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:04.200\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n2:25:04.200 --> 2:25:08.240\n You mentioned there's some criticism towards Bitcoin, there's a lot of excitement about\n\n2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:16.640\n the technology of Bitcoin for the resistance against this kind of central state pursuit\n\n2:25:16.640 --> 2:25:17.640\n of power.\n\n2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:19.800\n So that's part of my criticism because I don't think it works.\n\n2:25:19.800 --> 2:25:28.360\n So yeah, I can imagine a world, I can imagine, I'd love to see a technology evolve that where\n\n2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:34.600\n money is competitive and it's a financial instrument that the government cannot touch.\n\n2:25:34.600 --> 2:25:36.400\n You think the state is too powerful?\n\n2:25:36.400 --> 2:25:37.760\n I think two things.\n\n2:25:37.760 --> 2:25:43.160\n I think right now, and maybe this won't be true in the future, right now, I think crypto\n\n2:25:43.160 --> 2:25:44.160\n is ill...\n\n2:25:44.160 --> 2:25:45.600\n It cannot function as money right now.\n\n2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:46.600\n It just can't.\n\n2:25:46.600 --> 2:25:47.600\n But it does.\n\n2:25:47.600 --> 2:25:48.700\n No, it doesn't.\n\n2:25:48.700 --> 2:25:50.880\n It functions as a mechanism.\n\n2:25:50.880 --> 2:25:56.840\n It functions as a mechanism to transfer, it's a technology that allows me to transfer fiat\n\n2:25:56.840 --> 2:26:02.680\n money from place to place, but it doesn't function, and it can't because it's too volatile.\n\n2:26:02.680 --> 2:26:03.680\n I've sold things with Bitcoin.\n\n2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:06.080\n No, I know you have, but I can sell things.\n\n2:26:06.080 --> 2:26:08.520\n I can buy things and sell things with my airline model.\n\n2:26:08.520 --> 2:26:12.480\n So there are lots of ways in which you can use things as money, but it doesn't make them\n\n2:26:12.480 --> 2:26:13.480\n money.\n\n2:26:13.480 --> 2:26:14.480\n If you're using something as money, it's money.\n\n2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:17.640\n So let me take something you said before.\n\n2:26:17.640 --> 2:26:19.360\n And it contradicts, I think, Bitcoin.\n\n2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:22.400\n You said one of the things about money is that it's stable.\n\n2:26:22.400 --> 2:26:24.660\n I know what it's gonna buy tomorrow, right?\n\n2:26:24.660 --> 2:26:28.480\n This is why we're against inflation, because I know what the dollar today I can plan, because\n\n2:26:28.480 --> 2:26:29.480\n I can't plan...\n\n2:26:29.480 --> 2:26:31.240\n I don't know what Bitcoin's gonna be worth tomorrow.\n\n2:26:31.240 --> 2:26:33.200\n So I can't plan with Bitcoin.\n\n2:26:33.200 --> 2:26:35.800\n Bitcoin is way too volatile to serve right now as money.\n\n2:26:35.800 --> 2:26:41.000\n Now, the argument from Bitcoiners is, yes, it's still being adopted.\n\n2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:43.560\n At some point, it'll reach a certain crucial mass.\n\n2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:44.560\n High perfect monetization, yeah.\n\n2:26:44.560 --> 2:26:48.680\n Yes, and then it will become money, because at that point, it can be used as money, because\n\n2:26:48.680 --> 2:26:51.520\n then it'll have a stable value.\n\n2:26:51.520 --> 2:26:56.120\n Maybe right now, it's not useful as money, because I can't predict what...\n\n2:26:56.120 --> 2:27:00.560\n I can't invest in it knowing what the value will be in five years.\n\n2:27:00.560 --> 2:27:01.800\n Right now, it's an asset.\n\n2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:05.160\n It's not a monetary unit.\n\n2:27:05.160 --> 2:27:06.960\n It's much more functions as an asset.\n\n2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:07.960\n Asset's value can go up.\n\n2:27:07.960 --> 2:27:08.960\n Oh, I agree.\n\n2:27:08.960 --> 2:27:09.960\n It's functioning much more as an asset than as money.\n\n2:27:09.960 --> 2:27:10.960\n That's not in dispute.\n\n2:27:10.960 --> 2:27:11.960\n I agree with that completely.\n\n2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:12.960\n So I don't think it's money.\n\n2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:16.920\n But so I think it's still...\n\n2:27:16.920 --> 2:27:20.000\n I think it can compete as a money with something tangible.\n\n2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:25.280\n So I think in a free market, some kind of crypto backed by gold would be more successful.\n\n2:27:25.280 --> 2:27:30.960\n So Bitcoin folks argue that Bitcoin has all the same fundamental properties that does\n\n2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:32.220\n gold.\n\n2:27:32.220 --> 2:27:33.920\n So it's backed by...\n\n2:27:33.920 --> 2:27:39.720\n There's a scarcity to it, and it's backed by proof of work, so it's backed by physical\n\n2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:40.720\n resources.\n\n2:27:40.720 --> 2:27:44.960\n And so they say that's a very natural replacement of gold, so it doesn't need to be connected\n\n2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:45.960\n to gold.\n\n2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:50.120\n So there are two things that gold has that it doesn't have.\n\n2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:52.640\n One is gold is not finite.\n\n2:27:52.640 --> 2:27:54.160\n Gold supply actually grows over time.\n\n2:27:54.160 --> 2:27:56.960\n Bitcoin at some point is truly finite.\n\n2:27:56.960 --> 2:28:02.060\n At least unless you count the fact that you can split bitcoins and create coins, but that's\n\n2:28:02.060 --> 2:28:04.520\n a whole other question.\n\n2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:05.520\n So that's one.\n\n2:28:05.520 --> 2:28:14.720\n The other one is that gold has value beyond its use as a currency, beyond its use as money.\n\n2:28:14.720 --> 2:28:15.720\n For jewelry and stuff.\n\n2:28:15.720 --> 2:28:16.720\n Yeah.\n\n2:28:16.720 --> 2:28:17.840\n But you minimize that.\n\n2:28:17.840 --> 2:28:21.760\n But jewelry and stuff has been important for the human race for 100,000 years.\n\n2:28:21.760 --> 2:28:26.200\n You can find jewelry in caves, for the cavemen designed jewelry and wore them.\n\n2:28:26.200 --> 2:28:29.360\n So we obviously as human beings value jewelry a lot.\n\n2:28:29.360 --> 2:28:33.720\n And almost all jewelry evolved to be made out of gold because whatever it is within\n\n2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:38.240\n us is attracted to shiny gold in particular, shiny object generally.\n\n2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:40.480\n So there's something about gold that appeals to human beings.\n\n2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:44.640\n There's some value that gold has beyond its being a currency.\n\n2:28:44.640 --> 2:28:46.140\n It's not that Bitcoin doesn't.\n\n2:28:46.140 --> 2:28:48.480\n Now it's not enough to use it as money.\n\n2:28:48.480 --> 2:28:50.340\n Lots of things appeal to human beings.\n\n2:28:50.340 --> 2:28:52.280\n But those are two characteristics.\n\n2:28:52.280 --> 2:28:59.120\n One that it's not finite and second that it is a value beyond that Bitcoin doesn't have.\n\n2:28:59.120 --> 2:29:01.660\n Don't you think the finiteness could be framed as a feature?\n\n2:29:01.660 --> 2:29:02.920\n The scarcity of Bitcoin?\n\n2:29:02.920 --> 2:29:07.880\n No, because I think it creates a real problem with scarcity economically.\n\n2:29:07.880 --> 2:29:10.100\n It's the issue of planning.\n\n2:29:10.100 --> 2:29:15.120\n There is a mechanism, there's a beautiful mechanism in markets that as the supply of\n\n2:29:15.120 --> 2:29:21.640\n gold is in a sense the quantity of gold is...\n\n2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:24.280\n Prices are going down because there's too little gold, right?\n\n2:29:24.280 --> 2:29:28.000\n So the value of gold in a sense in dollar terms, the prices are going down.\n\n2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:34.880\n What happens then is there's an incentive to then go mine for more gold, right?\n\n2:29:34.880 --> 2:29:37.800\n Because it becomes cheaper and cheaper to mine as the price goes down.\n\n2:29:37.800 --> 2:29:43.500\n So you mine for more gold, so it keeps increasing and it keeps increasing basically very correlated\n\n2:29:43.500 --> 2:29:46.460\n to the rate of increasing productivity.\n\n2:29:46.460 --> 2:29:51.760\n That's the beauty of gold mining because prices are related to gold, gold is the dominant\n\n2:29:51.760 --> 2:29:55.440\n money and it increases at about the same rate as productivity.\n\n2:29:55.440 --> 2:29:59.920\n So it keeps prices relatively stable.\n\n2:29:59.920 --> 2:30:04.080\n You still have bouts of inflation and deflation, but it keeps it relatively stable.\n\n2:30:04.080 --> 2:30:08.400\n With Bitcoin it's fine at its ends, now prices will only decline.\n\n2:30:08.400 --> 2:30:09.640\n What rate will they decline at?\n\n2:30:09.640 --> 2:30:12.800\n They'll decline at the rate of productivity increases.\n\n2:30:12.800 --> 2:30:15.480\n It's hard to predict the rate at which productivity increases.\n\n2:30:15.480 --> 2:30:19.840\n For example, technological shocks can change that dramatically.\n\n2:30:19.840 --> 2:30:26.180\n You could get bouts of dramatic deflation, dramatic price drops that could be problematic\n\n2:30:26.180 --> 2:30:31.480\n in terms of planning the same problem of inflation just reversed that you had before.\n\n2:30:31.480 --> 2:30:34.160\n So again, it's a technical issue.\n\n2:30:34.160 --> 2:30:35.720\n I'm sure there are ways to get around it.\n\n2:30:35.720 --> 2:30:38.320\n And again, I'm not sure.\n\n2:30:38.320 --> 2:30:43.160\n I don't know if you guys consider Bitcoin the end or the beginning, that is, is Bitcoin\n\n2:30:43.160 --> 2:30:46.760\n it or is Bitcoin just the first example of a technology that's evolving?\n\n2:30:46.760 --> 2:30:51.560\n I was just going to say there's the same technological issue with regard to gold, which is we now\n\n2:30:51.560 --> 2:30:56.300\n have the technology that was very expensive to turn elements into different elements.\n\n2:30:56.300 --> 2:30:59.680\n And at a certain, yeah, you could fire electrons at it or whatever.\n\n2:30:59.680 --> 2:31:00.680\n You can make gold.\n\n2:31:00.680 --> 2:31:01.680\n They figured out how to do it.\n\n2:31:01.680 --> 2:31:04.280\n It's not cheap and it's called big process.\n\n2:31:04.280 --> 2:31:09.680\n If gold is the standard, a lot of resources are going to be going toward turning other\n\n2:31:09.680 --> 2:31:12.300\n things into gold, making the production of gold cheaper.\n\n2:31:12.300 --> 2:31:16.220\n And that's going to have a similar consequence that Laurence talked about.\n\n2:31:16.220 --> 2:31:19.680\n That's kind of the category of security that Bitcoin has talked about, that it's very difficult\n\n2:31:19.680 --> 2:31:21.680\n to do that with Bitcoin.\n\n2:31:21.680 --> 2:31:24.280\n But I would argue that it's exceptionally difficult to do that with gold.\n\n2:31:24.280 --> 2:31:25.280\n It is now.\n\n2:31:25.280 --> 2:31:26.540\n But the thing is, there's not huge incentive.\n\n2:31:26.540 --> 2:31:32.040\n If gold is the basis and if gold is worth that much, gold isn't worth that much.\n\n2:31:32.040 --> 2:31:36.000\n Gold is worth, let's say, I'm saying in this world that we're talking about, in the future,\n\n2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:39.200\n gold is not going to be worth, let's say right now, gold is about 2000 bucks.\n\n2:31:39.200 --> 2:31:40.200\n It's less than 2000.\n\n2:31:40.200 --> 2:31:42.160\n Let's say it's 2000 bucks.\n\n2:31:42.160 --> 2:31:44.480\n That's its price in terms of dollars.\n\n2:31:44.480 --> 2:31:48.320\n So you'd have to, it would have to be worthwhile to create something of 2000 dollars.\n\n2:31:48.320 --> 2:31:49.880\n How much would you be willing to put into it?\n\n2:31:49.880 --> 2:31:50.880\n At some point, you're right.\n\n2:31:50.880 --> 2:31:55.000\n And at that point, I think gold stops being money because it's useless.\n\n2:31:55.000 --> 2:31:59.800\n Once I can create it like silicon, then once I can make out official gold.\n\n2:31:59.800 --> 2:32:02.840\n So I'm just not, I don't think Bitcoin is the solution.\n\n2:32:02.840 --> 2:32:06.080\n I think, I don't know what the solution is.\n\n2:32:06.080 --> 2:32:12.520\n I wish I was that innovative, but I think you need a solution that has more of the characteristics\n\n2:32:12.520 --> 2:32:14.600\n of gold than Bitcoin currently has.\n\n2:32:14.600 --> 2:32:21.440\n And I'm, I guess I'm surprised at a lot of the technologists who view Bitcoin as the\n\n2:32:21.440 --> 2:32:26.100\n end game, where it strikes me as it's a, it's the birth of a new tech, it represents the\n\n2:32:26.100 --> 2:32:29.920\n birth of a new technology and who the winner in that technology is going to be.\n\n2:32:29.920 --> 2:32:30.920\n We have no clue.\n\n2:32:30.920 --> 2:32:34.080\n Bitcoin is one of the players, there are other players.\n\n2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:37.600\n There might be a new technology that is even better than anything we can imagine right\n\n2:32:37.600 --> 2:32:42.280\n now that, so Bitcoin doesn't strike me as optimal.\n\n2:32:42.280 --> 2:32:44.400\n And that we should be moving towards something better.\n\n2:32:44.400 --> 2:32:50.560\n Can you please stop shilling randcoin for five minutes?\n\n2:32:50.560 --> 2:32:51.560\n You know where there was randcoin?\n\n2:32:51.560 --> 2:32:52.560\n There was rand.\n\n2:32:52.560 --> 2:32:53.560\n South Africa.\n\n2:32:53.560 --> 2:32:54.560\n No, I was.\n\n2:32:54.560 --> 2:32:55.560\n The agri currency is rand.\n\n2:32:55.560 --> 2:32:56.560\n No, that's true.\n\n2:32:56.560 --> 2:32:57.560\n No, I mean.\n\n2:32:57.560 --> 2:32:59.040\n Ayn Rand is the South African one dollar.\n\n2:32:59.040 --> 2:33:00.040\n Yeah.\n\n2:33:00.040 --> 2:33:04.840\n Ayn Rand coin was, I was in China in 20, I think it was 2015 or 14.\n\n2:33:04.840 --> 2:33:05.840\n What's that?\n\n2:33:05.840 --> 2:33:06.840\n China.\n\n2:33:06.840 --> 2:33:07.840\n China.\n\n2:33:07.840 --> 2:33:10.540\n I was in China 20, something like that.\n\n2:33:10.540 --> 2:33:16.200\n And this entrepreneur came up to me, she said she's bought this massive quantity of land\n\n2:33:16.200 --> 2:33:19.240\n in this area in China, it's a little secluded.\n\n2:33:19.240 --> 2:33:21.600\n She's starting what she's calling Gold's Gulch.\n\n2:33:21.600 --> 2:33:22.800\n She's serious.\n\n2:33:22.800 --> 2:33:30.000\n And she's issuing, and she issued cryptocurrency based on the land, right backed by the land\n\n2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:34.520\n called rand, but Ayn Rand with a little portrait of Ayn Rand, you know, a little portrait in\n\n2:33:34.520 --> 2:33:35.520\n the marketing.\n\n2:33:35.520 --> 2:33:36.520\n I don't think it went anywhere.\n\n2:33:36.520 --> 2:33:39.520\n You're not going to be a janitor?\n\n2:33:39.520 --> 2:33:42.240\n A janitor in China at Gold's Gulch.\n\n2:33:42.240 --> 2:33:43.240\n Yeah.\n\n2:33:43.240 --> 2:33:46.960\n By the way, I do want to point out something I do enjoy about Objectivist.\n\n2:33:46.960 --> 2:33:52.760\n I constantly talk about Ayn Rand and her vampire novels and that's the joke you're on.\n\n2:33:52.760 --> 2:33:54.160\n Thank you.\n\n2:33:54.160 --> 2:33:59.160\n And inevitably someone feels the need to point out that she did not write vampire novels\n\n2:33:59.160 --> 2:34:00.480\n and her name is actually Ayn.\n\n2:34:00.480 --> 2:34:01.480\n So thank you.\n\n2:34:01.480 --> 2:34:02.480\n Thank you.\n\n2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:03.480\n We've been talking for two hours.\n\n2:34:03.480 --> 2:34:05.240\n I owed her a copy of the Fountainhead.\n\n2:34:05.240 --> 2:34:06.440\n Somehow I thought her name was Ayn.\n\n2:34:06.440 --> 2:34:07.440\n Thank you.\n\n2:34:07.440 --> 2:34:08.440\n Thank you.\n\n2:34:08.440 --> 2:34:10.160\n I love them.\n\n2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:13.840\n So this is a really interesting way of phrasing it, which is...\n\n2:34:13.840 --> 2:34:15.360\n I was kidding with the Ayn.\n\n2:34:15.360 --> 2:34:17.200\n I know you knew how to pronounce it.\n\n2:34:17.200 --> 2:34:18.200\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:18.200 --> 2:34:19.200\n I know you know, you know.\n\n2:34:19.200 --> 2:34:20.200\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:20.200 --> 2:34:21.200\n It just got confusing.\n\n2:34:21.200 --> 2:34:23.400\n I think we all know and we all know that we're jokers here.\n\n2:34:23.400 --> 2:34:24.400\n We're all one.\n\n2:34:24.400 --> 2:34:27.960\n There's no Batman in this conversation.\n\n2:34:27.960 --> 2:34:29.800\n So it's an interesting way to frame it.\n\n2:34:29.800 --> 2:34:32.240\n Is Bitcoin the end or the beginning of something?\n\n2:34:32.240 --> 2:34:37.800\n And I've, as sort of with an open mind and seeing kind of all the possibilities of technologies\n\n2:34:37.800 --> 2:34:42.240\n out there, I also kind of thought that Bitcoin is the beginning of something.\n\n2:34:42.240 --> 2:34:50.120\n But what the Bitcoin community argues is that Bitcoin is the end of the base layer, meaning\n\n2:34:50.120 --> 2:34:53.520\n all the different innovations will come on top of it.\n\n2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:58.440\n Like for example, there's something called lightning network where it's basically just\n\n2:34:58.440 --> 2:35:03.120\n like gold is the end and everything is built like the monetary systems like cash and all\n\n2:35:03.120 --> 2:35:05.240\n that is built on top of gold.\n\n2:35:05.240 --> 2:35:10.560\n Bitcoin is the end in that other technologies are built on top of Bitcoin.\n\n2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:11.560\n That's their argument.\n\n2:35:11.560 --> 2:35:16.880\n I get that and I hear that all the time and I just, I don't quite understand that.\n\n2:35:16.880 --> 2:35:23.040\n And I think Bitcoin has limitations that potentially other cryptocurrencies might not have.\n\n2:35:23.040 --> 2:35:26.520\n You know, my attitude towards something like this is to a large extent, I don't understand\n\n2:35:26.520 --> 2:35:28.120\n this technology.\n\n2:35:28.120 --> 2:35:31.560\n My view is let it play out.\n\n2:35:31.560 --> 2:35:41.320\n I think I have more fear of physical, the ability of the government to crush these things\n\n2:35:41.320 --> 2:35:43.000\n than I think many in the community.\n\n2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:49.200\n So for example, so I gave a talk, Bitcoin, you know, and they were hyping the acceptance\n\n2:35:49.200 --> 2:35:50.200\n now.\n\n2:35:50.200 --> 2:35:52.320\n A lot of vendors will accept Bitcoin and this is great.\n\n2:35:52.320 --> 2:35:54.120\n And I said, yeah, it's absolutely great.\n\n2:35:54.120 --> 2:35:57.000\n More options is better than fewer options.\n\n2:35:57.000 --> 2:36:00.320\n But I said, you know that that could be taken away like that.\n\n2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:05.800\n Now it's true that we could exchange Bitcoin and the government wouldn't know, I think,\n\n2:36:05.800 --> 2:36:06.960\n wouldn't know that we do.\n\n2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:11.560\n But once he's advertising on his website that he accepts Bitcoin or once he tries to turn\n\n2:36:11.560 --> 2:36:17.800\n his Bitcoin into particular goods, once you manifest it in the physical world, now the\n\n2:36:17.800 --> 2:36:18.800\n government can step in.\n\n2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:22.740\n So the government could say, you can't sell anything to anybody using Bitcoin.\n\n2:36:22.740 --> 2:36:24.920\n They can do that and you won't be able to sell it.\n\n2:36:24.920 --> 2:36:26.920\n It will have to go into the black market.\n\n2:36:26.920 --> 2:36:29.480\n But that isn't able to sell it, just sell it in the black market.\n\n2:36:29.480 --> 2:36:31.400\n Yeah, but that's where the government thrives, right?\n\n2:36:31.400 --> 2:36:34.120\n The government thrives on letting you do stuff in the black market so they can decide when\n\n2:36:34.120 --> 2:36:36.280\n to put you in jail or not, right?\n\n2:36:36.280 --> 2:36:40.660\n So if I'm buying a sweatshirt from the government, sorry, if I'm buying a sweatshirt from somebody\n\n2:36:40.660 --> 2:36:45.480\n using Bitcoin, the government can't monitor my exchange of Bitcoin to him.\n\n2:36:45.480 --> 2:36:49.480\n But they can monitor the sweatshirt being sent to me, right?\n\n2:36:49.480 --> 2:36:51.400\n That's where they can interfere.\n\n2:36:51.400 --> 2:36:58.240\n And I think that at some point, to the extent Bitcoin is successful, it will be stopped.\n\n2:36:58.240 --> 2:37:00.400\n And that's what will stop it from becoming money.\n\n2:37:00.400 --> 2:37:02.920\n See, money can only become money.\n\n2:37:02.920 --> 2:37:06.380\n It can only become money if people are using it as money, right?\n\n2:37:06.380 --> 2:37:09.720\n And if the government can stop it being used, if I can't go to the grocery store and use\n\n2:37:09.720 --> 2:37:15.580\n my ATM that charges on Bitcoin or whatever, then it's not money.\n\n2:37:15.580 --> 2:37:21.680\n And I think that the government is going to step in and stop people from doing that.\n\n2:37:21.680 --> 2:37:23.240\n And that's what I...\n\n2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:30.520\n So I have more respect and fear for the power of government today.\n\n2:37:30.520 --> 2:37:31.800\n I don't see that at all.\n\n2:37:31.800 --> 2:37:33.400\n However, I could be wrong.\n\n2:37:33.400 --> 2:37:35.200\n And I'm sure Yaron hopes he's wrong.\n\n2:37:35.200 --> 2:37:36.200\n Absolutely.\n\n2:37:36.200 --> 2:37:37.200\n And in some sense...\n\n2:37:37.200 --> 2:37:42.120\n I hope the government just give in and the Fed tomorrow says, yeah, let Bitcoin thrive.\n\n2:37:42.120 --> 2:37:43.880\n But I think they'll want to regulate and control it.\n\n2:37:43.880 --> 2:37:47.280\n And the only way to regulate and control it is to stop it.\n\n2:37:47.280 --> 2:37:52.200\n Yeah, there's a bunch of people who argue that Bitcoin is too compelling to government\n\n2:37:52.200 --> 2:37:54.640\n that they'll actually embrace it, like a Trojan horse and stuff.\n\n2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:58.260\n But that assumes government has positive goals and wants to do good things.\n\n2:37:58.260 --> 2:37:59.260\n You can ask...\n\n2:37:59.260 --> 2:38:01.080\n No, no, it's greedy.\n\n2:38:01.080 --> 2:38:03.040\n They say government is greedy because they...\n\n2:38:03.040 --> 2:38:05.160\n Well, Bitcoiners have this whole lingo.\n\n2:38:05.160 --> 2:38:07.600\n They say number go up.\n\n2:38:07.600 --> 2:38:09.360\n Government is not greedy.\n\n2:38:09.360 --> 2:38:11.440\n Government is not greedy for money.\n\n2:38:11.440 --> 2:38:13.040\n Government is greedy for power.\n\n2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:15.520\n Government is greedy for control.\n\n2:38:15.520 --> 2:38:16.520\n Government is much more...\n\n2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:17.760\n Now, money is good too.\n\n2:38:17.760 --> 2:38:19.360\n They'll take the money if they can get it.\n\n2:38:19.360 --> 2:38:21.660\n But it's not fundamentally about money.\n\n2:38:21.660 --> 2:38:22.660\n It's fundamentally...\n\n2:38:22.660 --> 2:38:26.000\n And this is something that many libertarians don't understand.\n\n2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.640\n This is something many of the Bitcoin community don't understand.\n\n2:38:28.640 --> 2:38:34.720\n They have far too benevolent a view of politicians and the people in government today.\n\n2:38:34.720 --> 2:38:35.720\n By the way, I'm alive with this.\n\n2:38:35.720 --> 2:38:36.720\n And I know why he's laughing.\n\n2:38:36.720 --> 2:38:37.720\n I think I know why he's laughing.\n\n2:38:37.720 --> 2:38:39.360\n You know exactly why I'm laughing.\n\n2:38:39.360 --> 2:38:45.000\n And we should get to that issue at some point here.\n\n2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:46.560\n So I think there's a lot of naivete.\n\n2:38:46.560 --> 2:38:47.560\n Yeah, there's a lot.\n\n2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:48.560\n Speaking of naivete...\n\n2:38:48.560 --> 2:38:49.560\n A lot of it, Yaron.\n\n2:38:49.560 --> 2:38:50.560\n No.\n\n2:38:50.560 --> 2:38:51.560\n Okay.\n\n2:38:51.560 --> 2:38:52.560\n Okay.\n\n2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:53.560\n I'm not naive.\n\n2:38:53.560 --> 2:38:58.440\n I'm actually providing the warning and all these Bitcoiners are saying, no, no, no, government\n\n2:38:58.440 --> 2:38:59.440\n doesn't function that way.\n\n2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:01.000\n No one says I'm naive.\n\n2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:03.680\n Naive people think they're not naive.\n\n2:39:03.680 --> 2:39:05.160\n So let's put this on the table.\n\n2:39:05.160 --> 2:39:11.880\n Speaking of naive, I still more than the two of you by far, I think, have faith that government\n\n2:39:11.880 --> 2:39:12.880\n can work.\n\n2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:13.880\n Okay.\n\n2:39:13.880 --> 2:39:14.880\n Let's put that on the table.\n\n2:39:14.880 --> 2:39:15.880\n I got it.\n\n2:39:15.880 --> 2:39:16.880\n I'm not trying to be pedantic.\n\n2:39:16.880 --> 2:39:19.200\n What do you mean work?\n\n2:39:19.200 --> 2:39:20.320\n Government can achieve goals.\n\n2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:21.320\n That is not a dispute.\n\n2:39:21.320 --> 2:39:28.760\n Government can achieve goals effectively to build a better world, a functioning society.\n\n2:39:28.760 --> 2:39:31.400\n So I'm going to take it one step further than you.\n\n2:39:31.400 --> 2:39:32.400\n Oh, boy.\n\n2:39:32.400 --> 2:39:37.080\n The only way to achieve a better world is through government.\n\n2:39:37.080 --> 2:39:40.120\n Michael, what do you think about that?\n\n2:39:40.120 --> 2:39:41.120\n He almost dropped it.\n\n2:39:41.120 --> 2:39:42.120\n I said it on purpose that way.\n\n2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:45.440\n I'm glad that the mask is dropping.\n\n2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:50.680\n You cannot achieve, you cannot have liberty or freedom without a government.\n\n2:39:50.680 --> 2:39:53.480\n Now not anything like the governments we have today.\n\n2:39:53.480 --> 2:40:00.320\n So I think the idea that you can have liberty or freedom without government is the rejection\n\n2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:06.280\n of the idea of liberty and freedom and the undermining of any effort, any attempt to\n\n2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:07.280\n do it.\n\n2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:10.000\n In that sense, you, Lex, I know, exactly.\n\n2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:12.600\n On this side, I'm in agreement with Lex, which is unusual.\n\n2:40:12.600 --> 2:40:13.600\n That government is good for freedom.\n\n2:40:13.600 --> 2:40:16.040\n Yeah, you're in agreement with the guy who's reading Mein Kampf.\n\n2:40:16.040 --> 2:40:17.040\n That's not a surprise.\n\n2:40:17.040 --> 2:40:18.040\n Who's dressed in black.\n\n2:40:18.040 --> 2:40:19.040\n Yeah.\n\n2:40:19.040 --> 2:40:20.040\n That's the bad guys.\n\n2:40:20.040 --> 2:40:26.000\n But the fascism, I mean, the road to fascism is anarchy.\n\n2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:27.000\n It's not.\n\n2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:28.000\n What the hell are you talking about?\n\n2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:29.000\n Anarchy.\n\n2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:32.240\n Can you give me one example of an anarchy like the fascism?\n\n2:40:32.240 --> 2:40:37.480\n Well, every example of a stateless society leads to authoritarianism, every single one\n\n2:40:37.480 --> 2:40:39.060\n in all of human history.\n\n2:40:39.060 --> 2:40:40.060\n It has to.\n\n2:40:40.060 --> 2:40:43.000\n Wait, wait, you're saying Weimar Germany was anarchy?\n\n2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:46.120\n Well, it wasn't pure anarchy, but it got close.\n\n2:40:46.120 --> 2:40:47.120\n But no.\n\n2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:48.120\n It got close to anarchy?\n\n2:40:48.120 --> 2:40:49.120\n I said the reverse, by the way.\n\n2:40:49.120 --> 2:40:50.120\n I said the reverse.\n\n2:40:50.120 --> 2:40:53.600\n I didn't say that every form of authoritarianism started with anarchy.\n\n2:40:53.600 --> 2:40:59.720\n I said that every situation in which human beings lived under anarchy led to authoritarianism.\n\n2:40:59.720 --> 2:41:01.620\n So I said the flip was right.\n\n2:41:01.620 --> 2:41:03.160\n Anarchism isn't a location.\n\n2:41:03.160 --> 2:41:04.480\n Anarchism is a relationship.\n\n2:41:04.480 --> 2:41:07.280\n The three of us are in an anarchist relationship.\n\n2:41:07.280 --> 2:41:10.680\n Every country is in a relationship of anarchy toward each other.\n\n2:41:10.680 --> 2:41:14.480\n The US and Canada have an anarchist relationship toward one another.\n\n2:41:14.480 --> 2:41:23.920\n And to claim, you know, going back to Emma Goldman, who I love, in 1901, William McKinley,\n\n2:41:23.920 --> 2:41:27.260\n President McKinley, was shot by this guy, Leon Salgas.\n\n2:41:27.260 --> 2:41:31.100\n And it was very funny, but he was a crazy person.\n\n2:41:31.100 --> 2:41:32.100\n And they arrested him.\n\n2:41:32.100 --> 2:41:33.420\n He shot the president.\n\n2:41:33.420 --> 2:41:36.540\n And they go, why did you shoot President McKinley?\n\n2:41:36.540 --> 2:41:39.240\n And he just goes, I was radicalized by Emma Goldman.\n\n2:41:39.240 --> 2:41:40.640\n And she's like, oh, goddammit.\n\n2:41:40.640 --> 2:41:43.880\n So now she's on the lam, she had nothing to do with this guy.\n\n2:41:43.880 --> 2:41:45.640\n She's trying to flee.\n\n2:41:45.640 --> 2:41:47.080\n She gets arrested.\n\n2:41:47.080 --> 2:41:48.760\n They caught her.\n\n2:41:48.760 --> 2:41:53.880\n And she said, and this is the hubris of this woman, which I admire as the subject to be\n\n2:41:53.880 --> 2:41:54.880\n good hubris.\n\n2:41:54.880 --> 2:41:58.860\n She goes, I'd like to thank the cops for doing what they're doing.\n\n2:41:58.860 --> 2:42:02.660\n They're turning far more people into anarchism than I could do on my own.\n\n2:42:02.660 --> 2:42:11.080\n So given everything you've said in these two hours, and then to pivot to being anti government\n\n2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:15.200\n is being anti liberty, I don't feel I have to say anything.\n\n2:42:15.200 --> 2:42:16.200\n Well, okay.\n\n2:42:16.200 --> 2:42:20.040\n For people who are not familiar, if you're, I don't know why you would not be familiar,\n\n2:42:20.040 --> 2:42:26.200\n but Michael Malice talks quite a bit about the evils of the state and government and\n\n2:42:26.200 --> 2:42:33.240\n espouses ideas that anarchism is actually, what is it, the most moral system, the most\n\n2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:36.240\n effective system for human relationships.\n\n2:42:36.240 --> 2:42:41.800\n There's this great book called Atlas Shrugged and the author posits an anarchist private\n\n2:42:41.800 --> 2:42:42.800\n society.\n\n2:42:42.800 --> 2:42:46.400\n She calls it Galt's Gulch, where everything is privately owned and everyone is, no one\n\n2:42:46.400 --> 2:42:50.160\n is in a position of authority over anyone else other than the landowner.\n\n2:42:50.160 --> 2:42:51.160\n That's an anarchist society.\n\n2:42:51.160 --> 2:42:54.400\n There's one judge and one authority.\n\n2:42:54.400 --> 2:42:55.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:42:55.400 --> 2:43:00.800\n And that's what everyone has voluntarily moved there and agreed to be under.\n\n2:43:00.800 --> 2:43:02.400\n It's a very small community, right?\n\n2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:03.400\n Sure.\n\n2:43:03.400 --> 2:43:04.400\n That is right.\n\n2:43:04.400 --> 2:43:06.480\n There's no problem with competing governments.\n\n2:43:06.480 --> 2:43:08.080\n That's the definition of anarchism.\n\n2:43:08.080 --> 2:43:09.080\n What's that?\n\n2:43:09.080 --> 2:43:10.080\n That's the definition of anarchism.\n\n2:43:10.080 --> 2:43:11.080\n Case closed.\n\n2:43:11.080 --> 2:43:12.080\n Okay.\n\n2:43:12.080 --> 2:43:13.080\n End the show.\n\n2:43:13.080 --> 2:43:14.080\n End the show.\n\n2:43:14.080 --> 2:43:15.080\n I got him over.\n\n2:43:15.080 --> 2:43:16.080\n Mission accomplished.\n\n2:43:16.080 --> 2:43:17.080\n Not definition of anarchy at all.\n\n2:43:17.080 --> 2:43:18.080\n I'm all for competing governments.\n\n2:43:18.080 --> 2:43:19.080\n Hold up.\n\n2:43:19.080 --> 2:43:20.080\n You get more cookies.\n\n2:43:20.080 --> 2:43:21.080\n Good job.\n\n2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:22.080\n He did it.\n\n2:43:22.080 --> 2:43:23.080\n He did it.\n\n2:43:23.080 --> 2:43:24.080\n Yay.\n\n2:43:24.080 --> 2:43:25.080\n You're wrong.\n\n2:43:25.080 --> 2:43:26.080\n You brought him over.\n\n2:43:26.080 --> 2:43:27.080\n Red rover, red rover.\n\n2:43:27.080 --> 2:43:28.080\n More Lithuanian.\n\n2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:29.080\n What is this clown stuff?\n\n2:43:29.080 --> 2:43:30.080\n I was Lithuanian.\n\n2:43:30.080 --> 2:43:31.080\n That's my people.\n\n2:43:31.080 --> 2:43:34.880\n Yasnaya Polyana, Miodom, it's honey.\n\n2:43:34.880 --> 2:43:36.640\n No claims of health or nutrition.\n\n2:43:36.640 --> 2:43:39.040\n The other one claimed health.\n\n2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:40.040\n This one no claims.\n\n2:43:40.040 --> 2:43:41.040\n This makes no claims.\n\n2:43:41.040 --> 2:43:45.240\n No, I'm for competing governments on different geographic areas.\n\n2:43:45.240 --> 2:43:46.240\n That's fine.\n\n2:43:46.240 --> 2:43:47.600\n Why does it have to be over geographic?\n\n2:43:47.600 --> 2:43:48.600\n Okay, let me...\n\n2:43:48.600 --> 2:43:50.780\n It's really crucial that it's on different...\n\n2:43:50.780 --> 2:43:55.960\n So you don't have two judges in Galt's Gulch, you have one.\n\n2:43:55.960 --> 2:43:56.960\n And there's a reason why.\n\n2:43:56.960 --> 2:43:57.960\n There's one authority.\n\n2:43:57.960 --> 2:44:04.480\n There's one system of laws in Galt's Gulch that all the people under the Gulch abide\n\n2:44:04.480 --> 2:44:05.480\n by.\n\n2:44:05.480 --> 2:44:06.480\n There's one.\n\n2:44:06.480 --> 2:44:07.480\n There's two because they're in America.\n\n2:44:07.480 --> 2:44:08.480\n No, they're not.\n\n2:44:08.480 --> 2:44:09.480\n The whole point is they're not, right?\n\n2:44:09.480 --> 2:44:10.480\n They're not in America, they're in Colorado.\n\n2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:14.040\n I know, but the whole point of the novel is they've left America.\n\n2:44:14.040 --> 2:44:15.040\n They haven't left America.\n\n2:44:15.040 --> 2:44:16.080\n They've hid themselves.\n\n2:44:16.080 --> 2:44:17.680\n So they're not under the authority of the Americans.\n\n2:44:17.680 --> 2:44:18.680\n But they are.\n\n2:44:18.680 --> 2:44:19.680\n Don't you get it?\n\n2:44:19.680 --> 2:44:20.680\n But they're hidden.\n\n2:44:20.680 --> 2:44:21.680\n They're supposed to be...\n\n2:44:21.680 --> 2:44:22.680\n Hold on.\n\n2:44:22.680 --> 2:44:23.680\n The point is that they're hidden so they're not under the...\n\n2:44:23.680 --> 2:44:24.680\n No, no, no.\n\n2:44:24.680 --> 2:44:29.360\n If the three of us hide, we're still under the authority of Washington.\n\n2:44:29.360 --> 2:44:30.360\n Not if they don't know that we exist.\n\n2:44:30.360 --> 2:44:33.980\n But this is why they haven't established a state, and it's not a government, and it's\n\n2:44:33.980 --> 2:44:43.000\n not in that sense an example of really the way we form societies.\n\n2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:46.720\n It is a private club that is hidden away from everybody else.\n\n2:44:46.720 --> 2:44:47.720\n Fine.\n\n2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:48.720\n I'm fine with that.\n\n2:44:48.720 --> 2:44:52.020\n What happens if an American kills a Canadian in Mexico?\n\n2:44:52.020 --> 2:44:54.280\n What happens in America, it depends.\n\n2:44:54.280 --> 2:44:56.920\n Depends on the nature of the governments of the three places, right?\n\n2:44:56.920 --> 2:45:02.000\n But usually what happens in most of human history is that America will launch a war\n\n2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:04.040\n either against Mexico or Canada.\n\n2:45:04.040 --> 2:45:05.040\n Okay.\n\n2:45:05.040 --> 2:45:06.040\n First of all...\n\n2:45:06.040 --> 2:45:08.960\n So usually violence results in much more violence.\n\n2:45:08.960 --> 2:45:11.520\n Anarchy is just a system that legalizes violence.\n\n2:45:11.520 --> 2:45:12.520\n That's all it does.\n\n2:45:12.520 --> 2:45:14.600\n And in international affairs, that's the reality.\n\n2:45:14.600 --> 2:45:19.400\n The reality is that the way you resolve disputes that are major disputes is through violence.\n\n2:45:19.400 --> 2:45:25.560\n Ayn Rand said, the definition of a government is an agency that has a monopoly of force\n\n2:45:25.560 --> 2:45:27.160\n in a geographical area.\n\n2:45:27.160 --> 2:45:33.280\n So you can't complain that anarchism is legalizing violence when the definition of government,\n\n2:45:33.280 --> 2:45:35.280\n according to Rand, is legalized violence.\n\n2:45:35.280 --> 2:45:40.480\n No, but because you're taking the definition of violence the way she defines it, right,\n\n2:45:40.480 --> 2:45:41.480\n in this context.\n\n2:45:41.480 --> 2:45:43.680\n A, she talks about retaliatory force only.\n\n2:45:43.680 --> 2:45:45.880\n Has that ever happened?\n\n2:45:45.880 --> 2:45:46.880\n That's not the point.\n\n2:45:46.880 --> 2:45:47.880\n That is the point.\n\n2:45:47.880 --> 2:45:48.880\n Before there was Aristotle.\n\n2:45:48.880 --> 2:45:51.200\n Before there was an America, there was an America.\n\n2:45:51.200 --> 2:45:54.700\n The fact that something has never existed means that it will never exist before.\n\n2:45:54.700 --> 2:45:58.880\n The fact that the ideas haven't been developed to make something exist means that it will\n\n2:45:58.880 --> 2:46:00.640\n never exist before.\n\n2:46:00.640 --> 2:46:01.640\n You know, we're young.\n\n2:46:01.640 --> 2:46:03.260\n Human race is a young race.\n\n2:46:03.260 --> 2:46:05.460\n The ideas of freedom are very young.\n\n2:46:05.460 --> 2:46:08.240\n The ideas of the enlightenment are just 250 years old.\n\n2:46:08.240 --> 2:46:13.280\n The idea that you can't create the kind of government Ayn Rand talked about, I talk about,\n\n2:46:13.280 --> 2:46:16.060\n that it's never been before means it will never happen again.\n\n2:46:16.060 --> 2:46:17.060\n That's a silly argument.\n\n2:46:17.060 --> 2:46:18.060\n It's not a silly argument.\n\n2:46:18.060 --> 2:46:19.060\n You're being a Platonist.\n\n2:46:19.060 --> 2:46:20.060\n No, not at all.\n\n2:46:20.060 --> 2:46:22.400\n I'll explain to you how you're being exactly a Platonist.\n\n2:46:22.400 --> 2:46:26.520\n So if I was sitting in 1750 arguing with Thomas Jefferson, he was telling me what kind of\n\n2:46:26.520 --> 2:46:30.320\n state he was going to create, and I said, is a state like this ever being created?\n\n2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:31.320\n And he said, no.\n\n2:46:31.320 --> 2:46:32.320\n Was I being a Platonist?\n\n2:46:32.320 --> 2:46:33.320\n Of course not.\n\n2:46:33.320 --> 2:46:34.320\n No, you're being a Platonist.\n\n2:46:34.320 --> 2:46:35.320\n You know, things change.\n\n2:46:35.320 --> 2:46:36.320\n You're being a Platonist now.\n\n2:46:36.320 --> 2:46:37.620\n Here's why you're being a Platonist now.\n\n2:46:37.620 --> 2:46:41.940\n Because one of the things that Aristotle believed in, one of the things that Ayn Rand in other\n\n2:46:41.940 --> 2:46:48.240\n contexts believed in, the cover of her book, The Philosophy Who Needs It, is, I think it's\n\n2:46:48.240 --> 2:46:50.560\n the Sistine Chapel, the cover, or wherever it is.\n\n2:46:50.560 --> 2:46:52.520\n It's Aristotle and Plato walking.\n\n2:46:52.520 --> 2:46:53.520\n No, it's not.\n\n2:46:53.520 --> 2:46:54.520\n Yeah, but...\n\n2:46:54.520 --> 2:46:55.520\n What's that painting?\n\n2:46:55.520 --> 2:46:56.520\n I forgot what it is.\n\n2:46:56.520 --> 2:46:57.520\n It's the School of Athens.\n\n2:46:57.520 --> 2:46:58.520\n School of Athens.\n\n2:46:58.520 --> 2:46:59.520\n Thank you.\n\n2:46:59.520 --> 2:47:00.520\n It's the Raphael.\n\n2:47:00.520 --> 2:47:03.960\n So Plato's pointing toward the heavens while they're talking, and Aristotle's pointing\n\n2:47:03.960 --> 2:47:04.960\n to the earth.\n\n2:47:04.960 --> 2:47:05.960\n Reality.\n\n2:47:05.960 --> 2:47:06.960\n Reality.\n\n2:47:06.960 --> 2:47:07.960\n Absolutely.\n\n2:47:07.960 --> 2:47:09.380\n So if you want, there's two approaches.\n\n2:47:09.380 --> 2:47:14.600\n There's the Descartes, Cartesian approach, which is I sit in my armchair and I deduce\n\n2:47:14.600 --> 2:47:19.680\n all of reality, or if I want to study the nature of man, if I want to study the nature\n\n2:47:19.680 --> 2:47:23.240\n of dogs, if I want to study the nature of the sun, I have to look around.\n\n2:47:23.240 --> 2:47:24.240\n I have to open my eyes.\n\n2:47:24.240 --> 2:47:26.220\n I have to look at data.\n\n2:47:26.220 --> 2:47:27.480\n It's very difficult.\n\n2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:32.240\n You know, when Rand was on Donahue, he asked her about, aren't you impressed with the order\n\n2:47:32.240 --> 2:47:33.240\n in the universe?\n\n2:47:33.240 --> 2:47:35.920\n And she goes, oh, now you have to give me a moment.\n\n2:47:35.920 --> 2:47:39.360\n And the point she made, which was very hard for many people to grasp, it's hard for me\n\n2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:45.140\n to grasp, is one's concept of order comes from the universe.\n\n2:47:45.140 --> 2:47:51.020\n You can't have a disorderly universe because order means describing that which exists and\n\n2:47:51.020 --> 2:47:52.400\n which has existed.\n\n2:47:52.400 --> 2:47:58.780\n Now, if you are looking at governments throughout history that have always existed, and when\n\n2:47:58.780 --> 2:48:04.440\n you were on Lex, you said, what I'm talking about has never existed.\n\n2:48:04.440 --> 2:48:10.580\n To say that this, therefore, that that has a possibility of working in reality, I think\n\n2:48:10.580 --> 2:48:13.500\n is certainly not a point in that favor, number one.\n\n2:48:13.500 --> 2:48:16.420\n And number two, Jefferson was a fraud.\n\n2:48:16.420 --> 2:48:21.360\n What Jefferson argued how America would look did not come true.\n\n2:48:21.360 --> 2:48:24.880\n Jefferson's concerns about the Constitution were accurate.\n\n2:48:24.880 --> 2:48:29.940\n And the fact is the federal government did become centralized, did become a civil war.\n\n2:48:29.940 --> 2:48:34.420\n So if you told Mr. Jefferson the government you're positing can't work, you would have\n\n2:48:34.420 --> 2:48:36.700\n been correct.\n\n2:48:36.700 --> 2:48:37.700\n That's not what I'm saying.\n\n2:48:37.700 --> 2:48:39.860\n It's not the issue of can it work or not.\n\n2:48:39.860 --> 2:48:45.140\n It's the issue of can something exist that hasn't existed in the past?\n\n2:48:45.140 --> 2:48:46.260\n It's a silly argument.\n\n2:48:46.260 --> 2:48:50.060\n Now, we can argue about the fact of reality, whether such a thing can exist.\n\n2:48:50.060 --> 2:48:53.940\n But to say it hasn't existed in the past is not an argument about whether it can exist\n\n2:48:53.940 --> 2:48:54.940\n in the future.\n\n2:48:54.940 --> 2:48:55.940\n But that's the argument you made.\n\n2:48:55.940 --> 2:48:58.380\n No, no, you're talking about history and now you're dancing around it.\n\n2:48:58.380 --> 2:48:59.380\n No, I'm not.\n\n2:48:59.380 --> 2:49:00.380\n Sure.\n\n2:49:00.380 --> 2:49:04.020\n I'm saying that something different happened in the founding of America.\n\n2:49:04.020 --> 2:49:07.360\n It might not have been perfect, might not have been ideal, it might have been some people\n\n2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:08.360\n even think it was bad, right?\n\n2:49:08.360 --> 2:49:09.360\n Sure, it was different.\n\n2:49:09.360 --> 2:49:10.360\n Something different happened.\n\n2:49:10.360 --> 2:49:11.360\n Sure.\n\n2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:14.140\n And you could have said 20 years before and said, well, that's never happened before,\n\n2:49:14.140 --> 2:49:15.780\n so it can't happen in the future.\n\n2:49:15.780 --> 2:49:17.740\n That is a bad argument.\n\n2:49:17.740 --> 2:49:18.740\n It's not a good argument.\n\n2:49:18.740 --> 2:49:19.740\n Irrelevant.\n\n2:49:19.740 --> 2:49:24.420\n No, but you're making the argument that just because something hasn't happened before,\n\n2:49:24.420 --> 2:49:27.500\n that's certainly not a point to say it's likely to happen or possible.\n\n2:49:27.500 --> 2:49:28.500\n No.\n\n2:49:28.500 --> 2:49:34.460\n I'm saying, first of all, I agree that everything we know about what's possible or what's not\n\n2:49:34.460 --> 2:49:36.660\n possible has to be from reality.\n\n2:49:36.660 --> 2:49:37.660\n That we agree completely.\n\n2:49:37.660 --> 2:49:40.500\n I think anarchists completely evade that point.\n\n2:49:40.500 --> 2:49:48.660\n I think you guys live in a world of mythology, of abstraction, of Descartes, to imagine the\n\n2:49:48.660 --> 2:49:52.460\n kind of anarchy that David Friedman or Rothbard describe.\n\n2:49:52.460 --> 2:49:55.460\n It's complete fiction and it's complete mysticism.\n\n2:49:55.460 --> 2:49:59.700\n Okay, let me ask just a few dumb questions.\n\n2:49:59.700 --> 2:50:06.380\n So first of all, what do we do with violence in terms of just natural emergence of violence\n\n2:50:06.380 --> 2:50:08.180\n in human societies?\n\n2:50:08.180 --> 2:50:15.540\n So the idea that anarchism proposes is that we would, as the community grows, there may\n\n2:50:15.540 --> 2:50:21.500\n be violence and then we together form collectives that sort of fund mechanisms that resist that\n\n2:50:21.500 --> 2:50:22.500\n violence.\n\n2:50:22.500 --> 2:50:28.740\n I mean, I'd love to sort of talk about violence because that seems to be the core thing.\n\n2:50:28.740 --> 2:50:33.820\n That's the difference between the state that was definitionally, I guess, is the thing\n\n2:50:33.820 --> 2:50:39.540\n that has a monopoly on violence or controls violence in such a way that you don't have\n\n2:50:39.540 --> 2:50:40.540\n to worry about it.\n\n2:50:40.540 --> 2:50:44.700\n And then the anarchism, I don't know, I'm using bad words.\n\n2:50:44.700 --> 2:50:49.580\n Your definition is accurate, but the point is that being definition of the state versus\n\n2:50:49.580 --> 2:50:54.020\n how states act in reality is just absurd, yeah.\n\n2:50:54.020 --> 2:50:59.860\n And then the idea that anarchism will be is that it's more kind of a market of defenses\n\n2:50:59.860 --> 2:51:01.360\n against violence.\n\n2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:06.500\n So you have like security companies and then you hire different ones that are more competent.\n\n2:51:06.500 --> 2:51:12.060\n You have things being made affordable, you have more accessibility to security, you have\n\n2:51:12.060 --> 2:51:19.120\n accountability when people misuse their power, and you have more layers of security than\n\n2:51:19.120 --> 2:51:20.980\n having a government monopoly.\n\n2:51:20.980 --> 2:51:25.300\n What every objectivist understand, and they don't deny this, this is something they talk\n\n2:51:25.300 --> 2:51:31.980\n about constantly, is anytime you have a government monopoly, it's going to have enormous distortions\n\n2:51:31.980 --> 2:51:32.980\n as a consequence.\n\n2:51:32.980 --> 2:51:34.300\n It's going to be expensive.\n\n2:51:34.300 --> 2:51:35.300\n It's going to be ineffective.\n\n2:51:35.300 --> 2:51:39.500\n And when you're talking about ineffectiveness in markets, that's not just, you know, like\n\n2:51:39.500 --> 2:51:40.500\n the cup sucks.\n\n2:51:40.500 --> 2:51:42.240\n It often means mass death.\n\n2:51:42.240 --> 2:51:44.220\n It often means persecution.\n\n2:51:44.220 --> 2:51:50.820\n So this is something that anarchism, if not entirely prevents, certainly mitigates enormously.\n\n2:51:50.820 --> 2:51:55.380\n So can I just, as a thought experiment, say it was very easy to immigrate to another country,\n\n2:51:55.380 --> 2:52:00.080\n like where you could just move about from government to government, would that alleviate\n\n2:52:00.080 --> 2:52:04.740\n most of the problems that you have towards the state, which is like people being free\n\n2:52:04.740 --> 2:52:07.660\n to choose which government they operate under?\n\n2:52:07.660 --> 2:52:08.660\n Wouldn't that essentially be...\n\n2:52:08.660 --> 2:52:09.820\n Last scam, yeah.\n\n2:52:09.820 --> 2:52:16.660\n So like what is, I'm trying to understand why governments aren't already the thing that's\n\n2:52:16.660 --> 2:52:18.380\n the goal of anarchism.\n\n2:52:18.380 --> 2:52:23.100\n The kind of collectives that emerge under anarchism seems to be what government...\n\n2:52:23.100 --> 2:52:24.580\n You're equating two terms.\n\n2:52:24.580 --> 2:52:28.300\n So there's something called like private governance and there's government.\n\n2:52:28.300 --> 2:52:34.180\n So for example, if I go to Yaron's house and he has a rule, take off your shoes, become\n\n2:52:34.180 --> 2:52:39.300\n your house, if you want to really be kind of silly about it, you could say he's the\n\n2:52:39.300 --> 2:52:40.300\n governor.\n\n2:52:40.300 --> 2:52:43.300\n But it's really nonsensical to say that.\n\n2:52:43.300 --> 2:52:48.420\n If you go to Macy's, right, if you want to return your sweater, Macy's rules are right\n\n2:52:48.420 --> 2:52:49.420\n up there.\n\n2:52:49.420 --> 2:52:50.420\n You have seven days.\n\n2:52:50.420 --> 2:52:52.580\n If you don't have a receipt, you're going to get store credit.\n\n2:52:52.580 --> 2:52:54.460\n If you do have a receipt, you get a refund.\n\n2:52:54.460 --> 2:53:00.140\n So every organization, every bar, every nightclub, your house has rules of governments.\n\n2:53:00.140 --> 2:53:01.140\n This is...\n\n2:53:01.140 --> 2:53:02.140\n It's often they're unspoken.\n\n2:53:02.140 --> 2:53:03.140\n This is unavoidable.\n\n2:53:03.140 --> 2:53:09.460\n No one in America by law has to pay a tip, but it's just customary.\n\n2:53:09.460 --> 2:53:13.180\n You go at the waiter, you give them 15, 20%, so on and so forth.\n\n2:53:13.180 --> 2:53:20.940\n Now what anarchism does is it says, okay, security is something that is of crucial,\n\n2:53:20.940 --> 2:53:22.740\n essential human need.\n\n2:53:22.740 --> 2:53:26.420\n We all need to be safe in our property, safe in our purpose.\n\n2:53:26.420 --> 2:53:31.700\n The organization that by far is the biggest violator of this and always has been, always\n\n2:53:31.700 --> 2:53:33.580\n will be, is the government.\n\n2:53:33.580 --> 2:53:34.580\n Why?\n\n2:53:34.580 --> 2:53:37.260\n Because it's a monopoly, because it has no accountability.\n\n2:53:37.260 --> 2:53:40.380\n And look at the rioting last year, right?\n\n2:53:40.380 --> 2:53:44.540\n If you have one agency, pretend it's not the government, pretend it's Apple.\n\n2:53:44.540 --> 2:53:47.740\n And Apple has in charge of security in this town.\n\n2:53:47.740 --> 2:53:49.780\n People are rioting, people are looting.\n\n2:53:49.780 --> 2:53:52.740\n And Apple says, yeah, we're not going to send people into work.\n\n2:53:52.740 --> 2:53:56.380\n And if you try to defend yourself, we're going to put you in jail as well.\n\n2:53:56.380 --> 2:54:00.180\n That's the problem of having a government monopoly and that's something that anarchism\n\n2:54:00.180 --> 2:54:01.180\n solves for.\n\n2:54:01.180 --> 2:54:02.180\n Okay.\n\n2:54:02.180 --> 2:54:07.140\n But don't you, cause you said no accountability, don't you mean to say poor accountability?\n\n2:54:07.140 --> 2:54:09.620\n No, I mean to say no accountability.\n\n2:54:09.620 --> 2:54:11.740\n But isn't that the idea of democracies?\n\n2:54:11.740 --> 2:54:13.060\n I'm not for democracy.\n\n2:54:13.060 --> 2:54:18.980\n No, not for democracy, but like the system of governments that we have, there is a monopoly\n\n2:54:18.980 --> 2:54:24.460\n on violence, but there is a, I mean, at least in the ideal, but I think in practice as well,\n\n2:54:24.460 --> 2:54:25.460\n there's an accountability.\n\n2:54:25.460 --> 2:54:26.460\n I do not think that's the case.\n\n2:54:26.460 --> 2:54:30.300\n I know you're a critic of the police force and all those kinds of things, but the military\n\n2:54:30.300 --> 2:54:31.620\n is accountable to the people.\n\n2:54:31.620 --> 2:54:32.620\n I do not agree.\n\n2:54:32.620 --> 2:54:33.620\n The police force is accountable to the people.\n\n2:54:33.620 --> 2:54:35.180\n I do not agree.\n\n2:54:35.180 --> 2:54:37.900\n Perhaps imperfectly, but you're saying not at all.\n\n2:54:37.900 --> 2:54:38.900\n Not at all.\n\n2:54:38.900 --> 2:54:44.220\n And we've seen many examples of police officers doing horrific things on video and they don't\n\n2:54:44.220 --> 2:54:45.220\n even lose their pensions.\n\n2:54:45.220 --> 2:54:47.700\n But there's a lot of amazing police officers or no?\n\n2:54:47.700 --> 2:54:49.860\n I mean, no, there are not.\n\n2:54:49.860 --> 2:54:53.780\n So you're saying by nature, police is like a fundamentally flawed system.\n\n2:54:53.780 --> 2:54:59.140\n No, by nature, government monopoly on police is a fundamentally irredeemable system.\n\n2:54:59.140 --> 2:55:01.000\n Talk about private security.\n\n2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:05.300\n If I have a private security firm, you could have that under a government.\n\n2:55:05.300 --> 2:55:10.880\n And as a result of my private security, my person who I'm bodyguarding gets shot.\n\n2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:14.940\n That's going to be very bad for my company as compared to competing companies.\n\n2:55:14.940 --> 2:55:18.420\n However, when you have a government monopoly and I get people shot, what are you going\n\n2:55:18.420 --> 2:55:20.800\n to do?\n\n2:55:20.800 --> 2:55:25.780\n So the problem is that all the examples are going to be within the context of an existing\n\n2:55:25.780 --> 2:55:26.780\n government.\n\n2:55:26.780 --> 2:55:30.300\n The iPhone example and all these other examples of us being here, we're not an anarchy.\n\n2:55:30.300 --> 2:55:31.300\n That is absurd.\n\n2:55:31.300 --> 2:55:35.260\n We're under a particular system of law and the system of laws applies and we know that\n\n2:55:35.260 --> 2:55:37.800\n the particular system of laws applies.\n\n2:55:37.800 --> 2:55:40.380\n So the problem is when you have...\n\n2:55:40.380 --> 2:55:43.820\n There are many laws that we're not going to be enforced, that we're not going to be subject\n\n2:55:43.820 --> 2:55:44.820\n to.\n\n2:55:44.820 --> 2:55:45.820\n Sure.\n\n2:55:45.820 --> 2:55:46.820\n We know that.\n\n2:55:46.820 --> 2:55:47.820\n Violence related?\n\n2:55:47.820 --> 2:55:48.820\n No, there are lots of laws that are not going to be enforced.\n\n2:55:48.820 --> 2:55:49.820\n Right.\n\n2:55:49.820 --> 2:55:54.300\n And that doesn't make this anarchy because there are the laws out there.\n\n2:55:54.300 --> 2:55:57.180\n They could be enforced, which makes it an anarchy.\n\n2:55:57.180 --> 2:56:00.140\n But look, there's a number of issues here.\n\n2:56:00.140 --> 2:56:03.300\n There's an issue of the role of force in human society.\n\n2:56:03.300 --> 2:56:06.540\n I got to clarify things because I think you misunderstood what I said.\n\n2:56:06.540 --> 2:56:08.940\n I'm not saying that America is anarchist.\n\n2:56:08.940 --> 2:56:11.940\n What I'm saying is the three of us have an anarchist relationship between us because\n\n2:56:11.940 --> 2:56:13.580\n none of us have authority over the others.\n\n2:56:13.580 --> 2:56:14.580\n That's what I'm saying.\n\n2:56:14.580 --> 2:56:16.780\n But that's a bad use of the word anarchy.\n\n2:56:16.780 --> 2:56:18.420\n No, that's the correct use of the word anarchy.\n\n2:56:18.420 --> 2:56:19.420\n It makes it meaningless.\n\n2:56:19.420 --> 2:56:20.420\n It makes it...\n\n2:56:20.420 --> 2:56:23.620\n Every time any people get together, they have an anarchistic relationship.\n\n2:56:23.620 --> 2:56:24.620\n Yes.\n\n2:56:24.620 --> 2:56:25.620\n No.\n\n2:56:25.620 --> 2:56:26.620\n We have a voluntary relationship.\n\n2:56:26.620 --> 2:56:27.620\n That's what anarchism means, voluntarism.\n\n2:56:27.620 --> 2:56:28.620\n No.\n\n2:56:28.620 --> 2:56:29.620\n No, it doesn't.\n\n2:56:29.620 --> 2:56:30.620\n It's a political system.\n\n2:56:30.620 --> 2:56:31.620\n You want to get a dictionary out?\n\n2:56:31.620 --> 2:56:33.860\n You're taking a word and it's accepted usage.\n\n2:56:33.860 --> 2:56:35.860\n And then you're saying, oh, no, it means...\n\n2:56:35.860 --> 2:56:36.860\n You mean like selfishness?\n\n2:56:36.860 --> 2:56:37.860\n Maybe.\n\n2:56:37.860 --> 2:56:38.860\n And we never finished that discussion.\n\n2:56:38.860 --> 2:56:44.860\n You're taking a word, we're taking a word that you're defining and replacing it with\n\n2:56:44.860 --> 2:56:45.860\n voluntary.\n\n2:56:45.860 --> 2:56:46.860\n Now, voluntary...\n\n2:56:46.860 --> 2:56:47.860\n Okay, fine.\n\n2:56:47.860 --> 2:56:48.860\n I'm not for anarchism or voluntarism.\n\n2:56:48.860 --> 2:56:49.860\n Fine.\n\n2:56:49.860 --> 2:56:50.860\n Go ahead.\n\n2:56:50.860 --> 2:56:51.860\n But let's understand what voluntary means, right?\n\n2:56:51.860 --> 2:56:55.660\n For example, going to stores and there's a certain relationship that we have with a store\n\n2:56:55.660 --> 2:56:58.860\n that we engage in certain voluntary transactions with that store.\n\n2:56:58.860 --> 2:57:05.140\n Now, I believe that that works because there is a certain system of law that both the store\n\n2:57:05.140 --> 2:57:08.780\n and we have accepted that makes that possible.\n\n2:57:08.780 --> 2:57:12.700\n Now, if that didn't, there are certain people who would like to walk into their store and\n\n2:57:12.700 --> 2:57:14.580\n just take the stuff, right?\n\n2:57:14.580 --> 2:57:16.100\n So there is a...\n\n2:57:16.100 --> 2:57:19.220\n We might not, but there are certain people who might want it to go into their store.\n\n2:57:19.220 --> 2:57:25.460\n There's a certain system of laws that regulates the relationship and that defines the property\n\n2:57:25.460 --> 2:57:28.620\n rights and then provides protection for the property rights.\n\n2:57:28.620 --> 2:57:30.660\n Now, you would like all that privatized.\n\n2:57:30.660 --> 2:57:33.820\n That is, the store would have its police force and that would be privatized.\n\n2:57:33.820 --> 2:57:39.540\n Now, I don't believe that force can be privatized and there are many reasons...\n\n2:57:39.540 --> 2:57:41.040\n And it shouldn't.\n\n2:57:41.040 --> 2:57:44.340\n I don't think it can and I don't think...\n\n2:57:44.340 --> 2:57:45.340\n I think it's a...\n\n2:57:45.340 --> 2:57:46.340\n That's an interesting distinction.\n\n2:57:46.340 --> 2:57:50.460\n I don't think it can because I think that it's an unstable equilibrium, right?\n\n2:57:50.460 --> 2:57:55.500\n I don't think competing police forces can work.\n\n2:57:55.500 --> 2:58:00.060\n At the end, the police force with the biggest gun always wins and always takes over and\n\n2:58:00.060 --> 2:58:01.060\n becomes authoritarian.\n\n2:58:01.060 --> 2:58:02.060\n That's not true.\n\n2:58:02.060 --> 2:58:03.580\n Look at Iran and Iraq, excuse me.\n\n2:58:03.580 --> 2:58:06.300\n We had the bigger guns, we didn't win.\n\n2:58:06.300 --> 2:58:09.900\n Look at Afghanistan.\n\n2:58:09.900 --> 2:58:13.100\n We didn't win partially because none of that is an example of anarchy.\n\n2:58:13.100 --> 2:58:15.540\n No, but you just said the guy with the biggest gun is gonna win.\n\n2:58:15.540 --> 2:58:16.540\n Yeah.\n\n2:58:16.540 --> 2:58:17.540\n The guy with the biggest gun is gonna win.\n\n2:58:17.540 --> 2:58:18.540\n We didn't win in Vietnam.\n\n2:58:18.540 --> 2:58:19.540\n We had the bigger guns.\n\n2:58:19.540 --> 2:58:22.300\n But again, you're taking it outside of a context.\n\n2:58:22.300 --> 2:58:27.380\n That was a context in which countries are fighting, not a context in which there is\n\n2:58:27.380 --> 2:58:28.380\n no country.\n\n2:58:28.380 --> 2:58:29.380\n Okay.\n\n2:58:29.380 --> 2:58:32.960\n Let's suppose you, Yaron, have a rocket launcher and there's 100 people with handguns.\n\n2:58:32.960 --> 2:58:33.960\n How are you gonna win?\n\n2:58:33.960 --> 2:58:35.340\n You have the biggest gun.\n\n2:58:35.340 --> 2:58:37.660\n Oh, believe me, I could win.\n\n2:58:37.660 --> 2:58:39.340\n With one rocket launcher against 100 people?\n\n2:58:39.340 --> 2:58:40.340\n Yeah.\n\n2:58:40.340 --> 2:58:41.340\n It's just...\n\n2:58:41.340 --> 2:58:43.180\n Well, it depends how many rockets I have in the rocket launcher and whether I'm willing\n\n2:58:43.180 --> 2:58:44.180\n to use them.\n\n2:58:44.180 --> 2:58:48.420\n But that's... so now it's democracy because there are more of them that they win.\n\n2:58:48.420 --> 2:58:55.020\n Look, any one of these scenarios, all it does... so let's go back to the store.\n\n2:58:55.020 --> 2:58:56.020\n This is fascinating, by the way.\n\n2:58:56.020 --> 2:58:57.020\n I'm really enjoying this.\n\n2:58:57.020 --> 2:58:58.020\n I just want to say that.\n\n2:58:58.020 --> 2:58:59.020\n This is great.\n\n2:58:59.020 --> 2:59:00.020\n Because...\n\n2:59:00.020 --> 2:59:01.900\n I'm glad you are.\n\n2:59:01.900 --> 2:59:03.580\n I am enjoying the pain.\n\n2:59:03.580 --> 2:59:05.940\n And I'm also enjoying the comments that are gonna happen.\n\n2:59:05.940 --> 2:59:09.460\n Oh, the comments are gonna be overwhelmingly on your side.\n\n2:59:09.460 --> 2:59:10.460\n I don't think so.\n\n2:59:10.460 --> 2:59:11.460\n I know that.\n\n2:59:11.460 --> 2:59:12.460\n I don't think so.\n\n2:59:12.460 --> 2:59:13.460\n I don't think so.\n\n2:59:13.460 --> 2:59:14.460\n I'm completely dishonest.\n\n2:59:14.460 --> 2:59:15.460\n I'm a modern day...\n\n2:59:15.460 --> 2:59:16.460\n What's his name?\n\n2:59:16.460 --> 2:59:17.460\n What's the guy who is defending communism?\n\n2:59:17.460 --> 2:59:18.460\n Richard Wolff.\n\n2:59:18.460 --> 2:59:21.580\n I'm a modern day Richard Wolff.\n\n2:59:21.580 --> 2:59:27.820\n There's a sense in which I think anarchists are evading reality in the same sense.\n\n2:59:27.820 --> 2:59:28.820\n So we've got this...\n\n2:59:28.820 --> 2:59:31.700\n Do you think I'm dishonest or delusional?\n\n2:59:31.700 --> 2:59:35.860\n Calling someone dishonest is a really specific...\n\n2:59:35.860 --> 2:59:36.860\n I think you're delusional.\n\n2:59:36.860 --> 2:59:37.860\n I think you're delusional.\n\n2:59:37.860 --> 2:59:42.300\n And I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt of being delusional.\n\n2:59:42.300 --> 2:59:43.300\n That's fair.\n\n2:59:43.300 --> 2:59:44.300\n What is love?\n\n2:59:44.300 --> 2:59:51.980\n And as I said on the show, on the previous interview, I said, only smart people can be\n\n2:59:51.980 --> 2:59:56.960\n anarchists because it requires a certain level of abstraction of being divorced from reality\n\n2:59:56.960 --> 2:59:59.780\n that is hard for people who are actually connected to reality.\n\n2:59:59.780 --> 3:00:03.220\n He makes a good point because I always talk about this with people on social media and\n\n3:00:03.220 --> 3:00:07.460\n they talk about a lot of people who buy into the corporate media narrative and how they're\n\n3:00:07.460 --> 3:00:08.460\n dumb.\n\n3:00:08.460 --> 3:00:10.780\n I go, it's easier to train smart people than dumb people.\n\n3:00:10.780 --> 3:00:13.980\n It's easier to convince smart people of the systemic that's divorced from reality than\n\n3:00:13.980 --> 3:00:14.980\n somebody's dumb.\n\n3:00:14.980 --> 3:00:15.980\n You can deal in abstracts.\n\n3:00:15.980 --> 3:00:20.380\n I don't have to deal with the concretes that actually happen.\n\n3:00:20.380 --> 3:00:23.420\n This is an example I gave debating another anarchist.\n\n3:00:23.420 --> 3:00:24.420\n So...\n\n3:00:24.420 --> 3:00:25.420\n Who was it?\n\n3:00:25.420 --> 3:00:26.420\n She must have sucked.\n\n3:00:26.420 --> 3:00:27.420\n Well, you were the best.\n\n3:00:27.420 --> 3:00:28.420\n They were Hoppe fans.\n\n3:00:28.420 --> 3:00:29.420\n Oh, okay.\n\n3:00:29.420 --> 3:00:30.420\n Hoppe, okay.\n\n3:00:30.420 --> 3:00:31.420\n Hoppe fans.\n\n3:00:31.420 --> 3:00:33.340\n Not one of my least like...\n\n3:00:33.340 --> 3:00:37.500\n The people I like least in the world out there.\n\n3:00:37.500 --> 3:00:40.980\n You like them better than the communists, don't you?\n\n3:00:40.980 --> 3:00:41.980\n Barely.\n\n3:00:41.980 --> 3:00:42.980\n Oh, come on.\n\n3:00:42.980 --> 3:00:43.980\n Seriously?\n\n3:00:43.980 --> 3:00:44.980\n Yes.\n\n3:00:44.980 --> 3:00:45.980\n Because I think it leads to the same place.\n\n3:00:45.980 --> 3:00:46.980\n I really do.\n\n3:00:46.980 --> 3:00:47.980\n I think it leads to gulags.\n\n3:00:47.980 --> 3:00:48.980\n Fine.\n\n3:00:48.980 --> 3:00:49.980\n I think anarchy leads to gulags.\n\n3:00:49.980 --> 3:00:50.980\n And I think Hoppe's view of anarchy definitely leads to gulags.\n\n3:00:50.980 --> 3:00:53.140\n I'll grant you just for the sake of argument that it leads to gulags.\n\n3:00:53.140 --> 3:00:58.220\n However, surely you concede that they are against gulags whereas the commies have no\n\n3:00:58.220 --> 3:00:59.220\n problem with it.\n\n3:00:59.220 --> 3:01:00.220\n And that's a big...\n\n3:01:00.220 --> 3:01:01.220\n I think some do.\n\n3:01:01.220 --> 3:01:03.220\n I'm not sure people like Hoppe do.\n\n3:01:03.220 --> 3:01:07.980\n Because if you read some of his stuff, one wonders, right?\n\n3:01:07.980 --> 3:01:09.860\n But he wants monarchies and he wants...\n\n3:01:09.860 --> 3:01:13.300\n No, he said monarchies are preferable to democracy, which is true.\n\n3:01:13.300 --> 3:01:14.300\n No, it's not.\n\n3:01:14.300 --> 3:01:15.300\n Oh, God.\n\n3:01:15.300 --> 3:01:17.060\n I mean, one of the problems with an anarchist is...\n\n3:01:17.060 --> 3:01:18.060\n What judge?\n\n3:01:18.060 --> 3:01:19.060\n That's the monarch.\n\n3:01:19.060 --> 3:01:20.060\n One of the problems...\n\n3:01:20.060 --> 3:01:21.060\n Yeah.\n\n3:01:21.060 --> 3:01:22.060\n One judge, one authority.\n\n3:01:22.060 --> 3:01:23.060\n This is why I think...\n\n3:01:23.060 --> 3:01:24.060\n Yeah, the monarch.\n\n3:01:24.060 --> 3:01:25.060\n That's why I think...\n\n3:01:25.060 --> 3:01:26.060\n So you're a Hoppean.\n\n3:01:26.060 --> 3:01:27.060\n I don't think it's authoritarians.\n\n3:01:27.060 --> 3:01:28.060\n So Yaron Brooks is a Hoppean.\n\n3:01:28.060 --> 3:01:29.060\n Get in the chopper.\n\n3:01:29.060 --> 3:01:30.060\n No, I'm not a Hoppean.\n\n3:01:30.060 --> 3:01:31.060\n I don't want one judge.\n\n3:01:31.060 --> 3:01:33.100\n I don't want an arbitrary judge.\n\n3:01:33.100 --> 3:01:34.780\n I want an objective judge.\n\n3:01:34.780 --> 3:01:37.940\n There's an essay by John Hasnas, I think his name, I'm gonna bungle it.\n\n3:01:37.940 --> 3:01:40.180\n It's gonna be in my upcoming book on anarchism.\n\n3:01:40.180 --> 3:01:44.660\n And he just discusses, and it's a very long, complicated, technical issue, that the idea\n\n3:01:44.660 --> 3:01:46.700\n of objective law is incoherent.\n\n3:01:46.700 --> 3:01:47.700\n Well, yeah.\n\n3:01:47.700 --> 3:01:49.980\n I mean, that's why we disagree so much.\n\n3:01:49.980 --> 3:01:50.980\n Yeah.\n\n3:01:50.980 --> 3:01:53.200\n Because I think objective law is the only coherent system.\n\n3:01:53.200 --> 3:02:01.740\n Do you disagree that we, in effect, have competing systems of law under America?\n\n3:02:01.740 --> 3:02:04.020\n Meaning there's different ideologies.\n\n3:02:04.020 --> 3:02:08.220\n You have the Sotomayor ideology versus the Scalia ideology, and that effectively.\n\n3:02:08.220 --> 3:02:12.780\n And the point being, when you and I file a lawsuit, it completely depends on who the\n\n3:02:12.780 --> 3:02:13.780\n judge is.\n\n3:02:13.780 --> 3:02:14.780\n Yes.\n\n3:02:14.780 --> 3:02:15.780\n Okay.\n\n3:02:15.780 --> 3:02:18.180\n And in theory, I don't think the system works this way, but in theory, the way the system\n\n3:02:18.180 --> 3:02:23.380\n would work is that on new issues, there is some competition.\n\n3:02:23.380 --> 3:02:26.700\n Syria wasn't talking to you.\n\n3:02:26.700 --> 3:02:27.700\n Technology.\n\n3:02:27.700 --> 3:02:28.700\n Capitalism.\n\n3:02:28.700 --> 3:02:34.020\n So in theory, the system works, and this works, I think, with competing states, but also with\n\n3:02:34.020 --> 3:02:38.460\n competing legal views, particularly on a new issue.\n\n3:02:38.460 --> 3:02:42.220\n There's some, this is how common law worked, right?\n\n3:02:42.220 --> 3:02:46.820\n There's some evolution of it, and at some point, that gets codified into the law.\n\n3:02:46.820 --> 3:02:48.540\n And it gets objectified in that sense.\n\n3:02:48.540 --> 3:02:51.640\n That is, there's some conclusion that people come to.\n\n3:02:51.640 --> 3:02:56.500\n This is the role, in theory, of a legislature, and the legislature would be nice if it was\n\n3:02:56.500 --> 3:03:01.420\n composed of people who had some idea of legal philosophy.\n\n3:03:01.420 --> 3:03:03.620\n And it gets codified.\n\n3:03:03.620 --> 3:03:08.140\n Because these things are complex, and at some point, it goes through all the arguments,\n\n3:03:08.140 --> 3:03:12.480\n and then a certain truth emerges, or a certain truth is identified, and that's what gets\n\n3:03:12.480 --> 3:03:14.020\n encoded in law.\n\n3:03:14.020 --> 3:03:15.900\n That's what the purpose of a legislature is.\n\n3:03:15.900 --> 3:03:22.060\n Now, if you have competing mechanisms that don't converge on one authority, because there's\n\n3:03:22.060 --> 3:03:24.420\n no one authority, there are multiple authorities.\n\n3:03:24.420 --> 3:03:30.020\n That is, in a sense, there are multiple governments or multiple systems of enforcement, right?\n\n3:03:30.020 --> 3:03:38.060\n Then you get not just something emerging out of it, what you get is competing legal systems.\n\n3:03:38.060 --> 3:03:44.660\n Competing legal systems that now have competing mechanisms of enforcement, competing police\n\n3:03:44.660 --> 3:03:47.980\n forces, competing militaries, however we want to define it.\n\n3:03:47.980 --> 3:03:50.500\n And now there's no mechanism to resolve that.\n\n3:03:50.500 --> 3:03:55.180\n Now, yes, we could negotiate, and there's goodwill, and so on, right?\n\n3:03:55.180 --> 3:03:56.180\n Yeah, there you go.\n\n3:03:56.180 --> 3:03:57.180\n No, no.\n\n3:03:57.180 --> 3:04:04.420\n But now we're talking about the law, what each view, each position views as true and\n\n3:04:04.420 --> 3:04:06.180\n right, right?\n\n3:04:06.180 --> 3:04:11.100\n And it might involve, for example, it might involve the fact that the legal system has\n\n3:04:11.100 --> 3:04:15.180\n come to the conclusion that it's okay for children to have sex with adults, and this\n\n3:04:15.180 --> 3:04:19.540\n legal system thinks that is evil and wrong, right?\n\n3:04:19.540 --> 3:04:23.860\n And something has happened between the two, right?\n\n3:04:23.860 --> 3:04:24.860\n How do you resolve that conflict?\n\n3:04:24.860 --> 3:04:25.860\n There is no resolution.\n\n3:04:25.860 --> 3:04:30.420\n If this adult wants to have sex with this child, this legal system thinks it's okay,\n\n3:04:30.420 --> 3:04:31.740\n that legal system thinks it's...\n\n3:04:31.740 --> 3:04:35.620\n The only way to resolve that system is through one system imposing itself on the other.\n\n3:04:35.620 --> 3:04:37.600\n An example of countries is exactly that.\n\n3:04:37.600 --> 3:04:41.940\n When you had monarchies, when you had the little states all over the place, the way\n\n3:04:41.940 --> 3:04:46.540\n any kind of dispute was resolved when there were issues of territorial disputes, or issues\n\n3:04:46.540 --> 3:04:51.220\n of marriage, or issues of different legal interpretations about... was war.\n\n3:04:51.220 --> 3:04:52.220\n No, it wasn't.\n\n3:04:52.220 --> 3:04:53.220\n Yes, it was.\n\n3:04:53.220 --> 3:04:54.220\n It wasn't marriage.\n\n3:04:54.220 --> 3:04:56.260\n A lot of times people would marry a princess from another country just to feast.\n\n3:04:56.260 --> 3:04:57.260\n Sure.\n\n3:04:57.260 --> 3:04:58.700\n Forced marriages, which was not very pleasant.\n\n3:04:58.700 --> 3:05:00.900\n I'd rather sacrifice one princess than a queen.\n\n3:05:00.900 --> 3:05:02.940\n No, I don't want to sacrifice anybody.\n\n3:05:02.940 --> 3:05:03.940\n And in addition, I don't want to sacrifice anybody.\n\n3:05:03.940 --> 3:05:04.940\n I want to sacrifice the royals.\n\n3:05:04.940 --> 3:05:05.940\n And in addition...\n\n3:05:05.940 --> 3:05:06.940\n Well, I don't want royals.\n\n3:05:06.940 --> 3:05:07.940\n I don't want royals.\n\n3:05:07.940 --> 3:05:08.940\n Well, that's what sacrificing means.\n\n3:05:08.940 --> 3:05:09.940\n I think royals are pretty disgusting.\n\n3:05:09.940 --> 3:05:10.940\n Agreed.\n\n3:05:10.940 --> 3:05:11.940\n Let's get the baskets.\n\n3:05:11.940 --> 3:05:16.260\n And then on top of that, look, those periods in history are filled with violence, much\n\n3:05:16.260 --> 3:05:20.740\n more violence than we have today, much more bloody than they are today, far less freedom\n\n3:05:20.740 --> 3:05:21.740\n than we have today in terms of individual freedom.\n\n3:05:21.740 --> 3:05:22.740\n After the 20th...\n\n3:05:22.740 --> 3:05:25.740\n You're comparing this to 20th century.\n\n3:05:25.740 --> 3:05:30.340\n Yes, I'm comparing a monarchy, right?\n\n3:05:30.340 --> 3:05:32.660\n You said that's preferable to democracy, right?\n\n3:05:32.660 --> 3:05:33.660\n Yes, I did.\n\n3:05:33.660 --> 3:05:34.660\n I'm comparing...\n\n3:05:34.660 --> 3:05:35.660\n I'm saying Hoppe said that.\n\n3:05:35.660 --> 3:05:36.660\n I'm not saying I'm saying that.\n\n3:05:36.660 --> 3:05:37.660\n I'm saying Hoppe said that.\n\n3:05:37.660 --> 3:05:38.660\n To some extent.\n\n3:05:38.660 --> 3:05:39.660\n To some extent.\n\n3:05:39.660 --> 3:05:40.660\n But I'm not going to die in that hell.\n\n3:05:40.660 --> 3:05:41.660\n Hoppe said that.\n\n3:05:41.660 --> 3:05:42.660\n And I think it's ridiculous.\n\n3:05:42.660 --> 3:05:43.660\n These kings and queens were fighting constantly.\n\n3:05:43.660 --> 3:05:47.660\n I mean, the wars back then were violent in a way that...\n\n3:05:47.660 --> 3:05:48.660\n Unlike now?\n\n3:05:48.660 --> 3:05:49.660\n No, much more violent than now.\n\n3:05:49.660 --> 3:05:51.660\n If you look at the actual percentage of people killed in war...\n\n3:05:51.660 --> 3:05:52.660\n The Steven Pinker book.\n\n3:05:52.660 --> 3:05:53.660\n Yeah.\n\n3:05:53.660 --> 3:05:54.660\n If you look at the percentage of people...\n\n3:05:54.660 --> 3:05:55.660\n And not just that.\n\n3:05:55.660 --> 3:05:56.660\n You can look at the other stats.\n\n3:05:56.660 --> 3:05:59.100\n The percentage of people killed in war back then were far greater than the percentage\n\n3:05:59.100 --> 3:06:01.740\n of people even during World War II and World War I.\n\n3:06:01.740 --> 3:06:07.860\n So anarchy, and you know, David Friedman loves to quote the sagas of Iceland about how wonderful\n\n3:06:07.860 --> 3:06:08.860\n the anarchy...\n\n3:06:08.860 --> 3:06:13.180\n And I mean, it's funny because a lot of people who read David Friedman never read the sagas.\n\n3:06:13.180 --> 3:06:14.380\n It's worth reading.\n\n3:06:14.380 --> 3:06:19.300\n The sagas of the Iceland are filled with violence.\n\n3:06:19.300 --> 3:06:20.300\n Constant violence.\n\n3:06:20.300 --> 3:06:25.380\n Constantly people killing each other over, you know, I stole your chickens and you slept\n\n3:06:25.380 --> 3:06:27.140\n with my wife.\n\n3:06:27.140 --> 3:06:31.300\n The only way to resolve disputes, the only way to resolve disputes was violence.\n\n3:06:31.300 --> 3:06:34.820\n There was no authority, there was no mechanism to resolve these disputes.\n\n3:06:34.820 --> 3:06:38.100\n There was a council, but the council couldn't enforce anything, so in the end of the day\n\n3:06:38.100 --> 3:06:39.840\n we just resolved to violence.\n\n3:06:39.840 --> 3:06:46.620\n And this is legalized because there is no mechanism by which to make the violence illegal.\n\n3:06:46.620 --> 3:06:58.340\n So all anarchy is, is legalized violence constrained for a while and up until people stop that\n\n3:06:58.340 --> 3:07:04.100\n constraint by, you know, arrangements between the security organizations.\n\n3:07:04.100 --> 3:07:08.660\n But the security organizations have us by the balls, to put it figuratively, right?\n\n3:07:08.660 --> 3:07:09.660\n They really do.\n\n3:07:09.660 --> 3:07:10.660\n Sure.\n\n3:07:10.660 --> 3:07:11.660\n Unlike the state?\n\n3:07:11.660 --> 3:07:15.660\n Oh, the state today has it, but I would much rather live in this state, much rather live\n\n3:07:15.660 --> 3:07:20.180\n in this state, much rather live in many more authoritarian states than this, than a place\n\n3:07:20.180 --> 3:07:22.700\n where there's constant violence.\n\n3:07:22.700 --> 3:07:24.340\n I have a bunch of questions, but I'm enjoying this.\n\n3:07:24.340 --> 3:07:25.820\n Here's why everything he said is wrong.\n\n3:07:25.820 --> 3:07:26.820\n Okay, yes.\n\n3:07:26.820 --> 3:07:33.540\n Well, the idea of competing legal systems is inevitable because what Rand talked about\n\n3:07:33.540 --> 3:07:39.240\n is what she wanted was, and this is really kind of out of character with her broader\n\n3:07:39.240 --> 3:07:43.960\n ideology is, I think this was her term and I'm not saying this to make fun of you, when\n\n3:07:43.960 --> 3:07:49.540\n she has a judge and he's looking at the information, she wants him to be basically, I think she's\n\n3:07:49.540 --> 3:07:52.600\n the word robot, someone without any ideology.\n\n3:07:52.600 --> 3:07:56.780\n That they're just looking at the facts, they're not bringing their kind of worldview to it.\n\n3:07:56.780 --> 3:07:58.220\n I take it as a compliment.\n\n3:07:58.220 --> 3:08:01.060\n You are welcome.\n\n3:08:01.060 --> 3:08:11.880\n I think that given otherwise, her correct view that ideology is just a slur for someone's\n\n3:08:11.880 --> 3:08:17.140\n philosophy that someone, especially someone as erudite, educated and informed as a judge\n\n3:08:17.140 --> 3:08:23.620\n has to, and in fact should bring their ideology to their work is in one sense a little contradiction\n\n3:08:23.620 --> 3:08:25.220\n in her view, number one.\n\n3:08:25.220 --> 3:08:31.080\n Number two is we have right now the DA in San Francisco, I forget his name.\n\n3:08:31.080 --> 3:08:36.180\n He's the son of literal terrorists, communist terrorists, and he has made it the decree\n\n3:08:36.180 --> 3:08:41.500\n unilaterally that if you shoplift for less than, I forget, $200, we're not prosecuting.\n\n3:08:41.500 --> 3:08:42.500\n Yeah, I know that.\n\n3:08:42.500 --> 3:08:44.020\n You know this guy, right, right, right.\n\n3:08:44.020 --> 3:08:51.300\n So now you and I, and Lex I'm sure probably, agree that his ideology is abhorrent, that\n\n3:08:51.300 --> 3:08:57.220\n this doesn't help poor people, it doesn't help shop owners, it creates a culture, an\n\n3:08:57.220 --> 3:09:00.700\n area where it's just deleterious to human life.\n\n3:09:00.700 --> 3:09:07.180\n However, he has in one sense, given that he is a state operative, a legitimate worldview.\n\n3:09:07.180 --> 3:09:08.660\n Can I ask you just a quick question?\n\n3:09:08.660 --> 3:09:09.660\n Sure.\n\n3:09:09.660 --> 3:09:15.620\n Why couldn't a security force in a particular context say, yeah, if you take stuff on that\n\n3:09:15.620 --> 3:09:18.940\n store, we're not going to have any problem with that?\n\n3:09:18.940 --> 3:09:19.940\n I agree with you.\n\n3:09:19.940 --> 3:09:20.940\n That's very fair.\n\n3:09:20.940 --> 3:09:21.940\n That's a very legitimate question.\n\n3:09:21.940 --> 3:09:27.320\n The point is, in the context that I'm talking about, that firm is like, wait a minute, I'm\n\n3:09:27.320 --> 3:09:31.840\n hiring you for security, you're saying we're not going to provide security, why am I writing\n\n3:09:31.840 --> 3:09:32.840\n you a check?\n\n3:09:32.840 --> 3:09:34.860\n And we have examples of this in real life.\n\n3:09:34.860 --> 3:09:38.380\n If I get into a car accident with you, right?\n\n3:09:38.380 --> 3:09:41.720\n You have your car insurance, I have my car insurance.\n\n3:09:41.720 --> 3:09:45.380\n If your car insurance had their druthers, they wouldn't pay me one penny.\n\n3:09:45.380 --> 3:09:49.020\n If my car insurance didn't have their druthers, they wouldn't pay you one penny.\n\n3:09:49.020 --> 3:09:53.180\n We already have all, you were saying earlier that we need to have one kind of umbrella\n\n3:09:53.180 --> 3:09:54.480\n mechanism of use.\n\n3:09:54.480 --> 3:09:59.220\n There are already more cases than you can count where there's private arbitration.\n\n3:09:59.220 --> 3:10:04.020\n Now the argument is that private arbitration only works because they have recourse to the\n\n3:10:04.020 --> 3:10:05.020\n government.\n\n3:10:05.020 --> 3:10:09.460\n But my point is, there's many examples where even though that recourse is theoretically\n\n3:10:09.460 --> 3:10:16.460\n possible, it's not a realistic concern, specifically because they know that if you have recourse\n\n3:10:16.460 --> 3:10:22.180\n to the state, you have no concept of what that outcome is going to look like, except\n\n3:10:22.180 --> 3:10:28.340\n knowing it's going to be exorbitant, it's going to be time consuming.\n\n3:10:28.340 --> 3:10:29.980\n We can't use the state, right?\n\n3:10:29.980 --> 3:10:33.620\n I mean, I'm as critical as the state as it is right now.\n\n3:10:33.620 --> 3:10:36.980\n Maybe not as critical as yours, not as critical as yours, but I'm quite critical of the state\n\n3:10:36.980 --> 3:10:38.980\n as it is right now.\n\n3:10:38.980 --> 3:10:45.340\n But let's say we got into a traffic accident and you have a Rolls Royce and I destroyed\n\n3:10:45.340 --> 3:10:49.660\n your Rolls Royce and my insurance company now owes your insurance company a lot of money.\n\n3:10:49.660 --> 3:10:51.780\n And let's imagine it's a lot of money just for the sake of it.\n\n3:10:51.780 --> 3:10:52.780\n You're clearly guilty.\n\n3:10:52.780 --> 3:10:54.020\n Yeah, clearly guilty.\n\n3:10:54.020 --> 3:10:59.820\n And my insurance company looks at the books and it goes, I don't want to pay this.\n\n3:10:59.820 --> 3:11:00.820\n And you know what?\n\n3:11:00.820 --> 3:11:03.060\n I've got bigger guns than his insurance company.\n\n3:11:03.060 --> 3:11:05.580\n And I'm just going to take over their insurance company.\n\n3:11:05.580 --> 3:11:12.220\n And hostile takeover takes on a whole new meaning when I can muster guns on my behalf\n\n3:11:12.220 --> 3:11:17.900\n than in a hostile takeover in a capitalist context.\n\n3:11:17.900 --> 3:11:19.180\n That to me is what happens.\n\n3:11:19.180 --> 3:11:22.140\n That to me is inevitably what happens.\n\n3:11:22.140 --> 3:11:24.220\n And I think this is where the delusion comes in.\n\n3:11:24.220 --> 3:11:30.860\n The idea that when big money is involved and power is involved, remember, again, the same\n\n3:11:30.860 --> 3:11:36.380\n kind of politicians who today get into politics are likely to want to run some of these security\n\n3:11:36.380 --> 3:11:39.100\n agencies because they'll have a lot of power over people.\n\n3:11:39.100 --> 3:11:44.500\n The same kind of maybe sociopaths would be the same skill set, but that's a separate\n\n3:11:44.500 --> 3:11:45.500\n issue.\n\n3:11:45.500 --> 3:11:46.500\n I think it very much is.\n\n3:11:46.500 --> 3:11:50.740\n But you think people, the people in Washington, the same, the CEOs psychologically and skill\n\n3:11:50.740 --> 3:11:51.740\n set wise?\n\n3:11:51.740 --> 3:11:52.740\n Well, today's CEOs?\n\n3:11:52.740 --> 3:11:53.740\n Yes.\n\n3:11:53.740 --> 3:11:54.740\n Okay.\n\n3:11:54.740 --> 3:11:55.740\n Yes.\n\n3:11:55.740 --> 3:11:56.740\n You might be right.\n\n3:11:56.740 --> 3:12:00.400\n Because I think that's what's rewarded for a CEO, somebody who could get along with government.\n\n3:12:00.400 --> 3:12:05.140\n And I think the kind of CEO who is going to run a security company, which is not just\n\n3:12:05.140 --> 3:12:07.660\n about business, it's about the use of force.\n\n3:12:07.660 --> 3:12:08.820\n It's about control.\n\n3:12:08.820 --> 3:12:14.900\n It's about negotiation with other entities that are using force, you know, diplomacy.\n\n3:12:14.900 --> 3:12:19.100\n And we should get back to objective law because I think it's essential to this whole argument.\n\n3:12:19.100 --> 3:12:23.440\n I think all you get into is security agencies fighting security agencies.\n\n3:12:23.440 --> 3:12:24.940\n And again, the biggest gun.\n\n3:12:24.940 --> 3:12:28.940\n And I don't mean here the guy who has the biggest literal gun, the rocket launcher versus\n\n3:12:28.940 --> 3:12:29.940\n the guns.\n\n3:12:29.940 --> 3:12:30.940\n I got excited for a second.\n\n3:12:30.940 --> 3:12:31.940\n By the biggest gun?\n\n3:12:31.940 --> 3:12:32.940\n Yeah.\n\n3:12:32.940 --> 3:12:37.860\n The party that has the more physical force, however, that is mustered either by numbers\n\n3:12:37.860 --> 3:12:41.460\n or by weapons is going to dominate and will take over everybody else.\n\n3:12:41.460 --> 3:12:45.920\n Now, one of the things that's common in a market is takeovers.\n\n3:12:45.920 --> 3:12:47.360\n It's consolidation.\n\n3:12:47.360 --> 3:12:54.180\n And here the consolidation can happen through force and you can rule other security companies.\n\n3:12:54.180 --> 3:12:57.820\n And that's exactly what will happen until you dominate the particular geographic area.\n\n3:12:57.820 --> 3:12:58.820\n Okay.\n\n3:12:58.820 --> 3:13:00.100\n So let me explain why I disagree with that.\n\n3:13:00.100 --> 3:13:04.540\n You were just saying, and I agree correctly, I agree with you, that, listen, if I have\n\n3:13:04.540 --> 3:13:08.020\n access to the bigger gun, why am I paying you or whoever's paying whatever?\n\n3:13:08.020 --> 3:13:10.500\n I'm just going to use force and not pay them.\n\n3:13:10.500 --> 3:13:11.500\n We have that right now.\n\n3:13:11.500 --> 3:13:12.500\n It's called lobbying.\n\n3:13:12.500 --> 3:13:13.500\n Yeah.\n\n3:13:13.500 --> 3:13:18.460\n So instead of me, and I'm sure in your example, you weren't being literal, instead of the\n\n3:13:18.460 --> 3:13:22.820\n insurance company literally having the army, they could be like, hey, let me call corrupt\n\n3:13:22.820 --> 3:13:23.820\n co with a mafia.\n\n3:13:23.820 --> 3:13:24.820\n I agree.\n\n3:13:24.820 --> 3:13:25.820\n Yeah.\n\n3:13:25.820 --> 3:13:26.820\n Go out and take them out.\n\n3:13:26.820 --> 3:13:31.300\n By having this federal government, as you know, and certainly I'm not a fan of, takes\n\n3:13:31.300 --> 3:13:36.680\n more through asset forfeiture than burglaries combined.\n\n3:13:36.680 --> 3:13:38.780\n What asset forfeiture is, people don't even understand this.\n\n3:13:38.780 --> 3:13:43.620\n This is something crazy, which you're on, it's as opposed to me, as opposed as I am,\n\n3:13:43.620 --> 3:13:45.440\n which is I'm a cop.\n\n3:13:45.440 --> 3:13:46.940\n I go to your house.\n\n3:13:46.940 --> 3:13:50.260\n I think you haven't been charged or convicted of anything.\n\n3:13:50.260 --> 3:13:51.260\n I have evidence.\n\n3:13:51.260 --> 3:13:52.260\n It's usually in a car.\n\n3:13:52.260 --> 3:13:53.260\n Yeah.\n\n3:13:53.260 --> 3:13:54.260\n Yeah.\n\n3:13:54.260 --> 3:13:55.260\n It's like drug deals.\n\n3:13:55.260 --> 3:13:56.260\n Okay.\n\n3:13:56.260 --> 3:13:57.260\n I go to your house, you're a drug dealer.\n\n3:13:57.260 --> 3:14:02.780\n I say, and you can understand the reasoning, well, if someone is getting profit through\n\n3:14:02.780 --> 3:14:07.200\n illegal mechanisms, their profit isn't really their property and they shouldn't be rewarded\n\n3:14:07.200 --> 3:14:08.200\n that profit.\n\n3:14:08.200 --> 3:14:12.700\n So basically, I go to your house, you're a drug dealer, I seize all your property.\n\n3:14:12.700 --> 3:14:15.900\n You don't really have recourse, even though you haven't been through deep, I'm just explaining\n\n3:14:15.900 --> 3:14:20.000\n to the audience, through the new process and SOL.\n\n3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:25.200\n That combined, for people who don't know, is more than the total amount of burglaries\n\n3:14:25.200 --> 3:14:26.300\n in America.\n\n3:14:26.300 --> 3:14:27.440\n It's a huge incentive.\n\n3:14:27.440 --> 3:14:30.980\n And what happens is the police department, which seizes your car auctions, it sees your\n\n3:14:30.980 --> 3:14:34.280\n house auctions, it's a great way to line their pockets.\n\n3:14:34.280 --> 3:14:35.280\n This is a huge incentive.\n\n3:14:35.280 --> 3:14:36.640\n It's horrible.\n\n3:14:36.640 --> 3:14:42.920\n It's a huge incentive for police departments to do this because it's like, look, this guy's\n\n3:14:42.920 --> 3:14:43.920\n a crook.\n\n3:14:43.920 --> 3:14:46.680\n Maybe he's not a drug dealer, but he's clearly a pimp.\n\n3:14:46.680 --> 3:14:48.920\n Let me just take all his stuff and it's going to go to the community.\n\n3:14:48.920 --> 3:14:54.500\n Well, and the rationale originally was if I try him, in the meantime, he'll take that\n\n3:14:54.500 --> 3:14:59.440\n money and funnel it somewhere else and hide it, and I'll never be able to get access to\n\n3:14:59.440 --> 3:15:00.440\n it.\n\n3:15:00.440 --> 3:15:06.300\n And it was passed in the 1970s under the original Caesar Laws, what kind of RICO Act, going\n\n3:15:06.300 --> 3:15:07.680\n after the mafia.\n\n3:15:07.680 --> 3:15:12.480\n And one of the reasons I despise Giuliani as much as I do, and there's very few politicians\n\n3:15:12.480 --> 3:15:18.160\n out there that I despise more, is because he was the first guy to use RICO on financiers.\n\n3:15:18.160 --> 3:15:19.760\n And so it wasn't even a drug dealer.\n\n3:15:19.760 --> 3:15:27.640\n It was you accused of a financial fraud, not you weren't shown to be guilty, you were accused.\n\n3:15:27.640 --> 3:15:30.200\n All your assets basically were forfeiture.\n\n3:15:30.200 --> 3:15:31.960\n Innocent until proven guilty went out the window.\n\n3:15:31.960 --> 3:15:34.080\n If you were managing money, you were done.\n\n3:15:34.080 --> 3:15:35.080\n You were finished.\n\n3:15:35.080 --> 3:15:37.280\n So you're saying this kind of stuff naturally emerges with the state.\n\n3:15:37.280 --> 3:15:38.280\n Hold on.\n\n3:15:38.280 --> 3:15:43.080\n So my point is what are presented as the strongest criticism of anarchism are inevitably descriptions\n\n3:15:43.080 --> 3:15:44.380\n of status quo.\n\n3:15:44.380 --> 3:15:46.940\n What you're describing is already the event.\n\n3:15:46.940 --> 3:15:49.120\n I am a big insurance company.\n\n3:15:49.120 --> 3:15:50.720\n I don't want to pay you.\n\n3:15:50.720 --> 3:15:52.420\n I call Washington.\n\n3:15:52.420 --> 3:15:54.700\n Either I pay you and Washington gives me a subsidy.\n\n3:15:54.700 --> 3:15:59.200\n So what you're describing is an inevitable aspect of having a government.\n\n3:15:59.200 --> 3:16:03.440\n So what I'm describing is the inevitable evolution of anarchy into a government.\n\n3:16:03.440 --> 3:16:04.880\n I just think that the...\n\n3:16:04.880 --> 3:16:06.520\n Markets don't consolidate into monopoly.\n\n3:16:06.520 --> 3:16:08.800\n That's a leftist propaganda myth.\n\n3:16:08.800 --> 3:16:13.320\n Not markets where you have substitute products, but this is the problem.\n\n3:16:13.320 --> 3:16:15.660\n The problem is force has no substitute.\n\n3:16:15.660 --> 3:16:18.060\n That is force is not a product you can have.\n\n3:16:18.060 --> 3:16:22.920\n So this is my fundamental issue about turning competing police forces.\n\n3:16:22.920 --> 3:16:23.920\n Force is not a product.\n\n3:16:23.920 --> 3:16:24.920\n Force is not a service.\n\n3:16:24.920 --> 3:16:25.920\n It's a service.\n\n3:16:25.920 --> 3:16:26.920\n It's not a service.\n\n3:16:26.920 --> 3:16:27.920\n And it's not a product.\n\n3:16:27.920 --> 3:16:28.920\n Security is not a service?\n\n3:16:28.920 --> 3:16:29.920\n No.\n\n3:16:29.920 --> 3:16:31.960\n Well, security in the context of a legal system is.\n\n3:16:31.960 --> 3:16:32.960\n But this is the point.\n\n3:16:32.960 --> 3:16:37.680\n The legal system, the laws are not a service or a product.\n\n3:16:37.680 --> 3:16:42.400\n They are a different type of human institution.\n\n3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:44.680\n Science is not a product or a service.\n\n3:16:44.680 --> 3:16:46.400\n It's a different type of human institution.\n\n3:16:46.400 --> 3:16:48.260\n There are different types of human institutions.\n\n3:16:48.260 --> 3:16:49.560\n Some are marketable.\n\n3:16:49.560 --> 3:16:51.920\n You can create markets in, some you cannot.\n\n3:16:51.920 --> 3:16:54.280\n Law is not a marketable system.\n\n3:16:54.280 --> 3:16:55.780\n Can I ask a question quickly?\n\n3:16:55.780 --> 3:16:59.560\n Is there any other field other than law that you think you can't create markets?\n\n3:16:59.560 --> 3:17:00.560\n Well, science.\n\n3:17:00.560 --> 3:17:01.560\n Science is not marketable.\n\n3:17:01.560 --> 3:17:03.160\n The science itself is not marketable.\n\n3:17:03.160 --> 3:17:05.840\n What science is true and the same ethic is in law.\n\n3:17:05.840 --> 3:17:07.120\n Law is not marketable.\n\n3:17:07.120 --> 3:17:10.840\n Law is the system that allows markets to happen.\n\n3:17:10.840 --> 3:17:15.560\n You need a system of law, whether it's private law in a particular narrow context or whether\n\n3:17:15.560 --> 3:17:16.560\n it's broader law.\n\n3:17:16.560 --> 3:17:20.280\n Law is the context in which markets arise.\n\n3:17:20.280 --> 3:17:24.960\n So one of the reasons we transact is we know that there's a certain contract between us,\n\n3:17:24.960 --> 3:17:28.720\n explicit or implicit, that is protected by a certain law, whether it's protected by private\n\n3:17:28.720 --> 3:17:30.680\n agency or private, the government doesn't matter.\n\n3:17:30.680 --> 3:17:34.360\n But there's a certain contract that is protectable, right?\n\n3:17:34.360 --> 3:17:35.360\n By a system.\n\n3:17:35.360 --> 3:17:36.360\n Theoretically.\n\n3:17:36.360 --> 3:17:37.360\n Theoretically.\n\n3:17:37.360 --> 3:17:38.360\n Yes.\n\n3:17:38.360 --> 3:17:40.640\n So law is the context in which markets arise.\n\n3:17:40.640 --> 3:17:47.680\n You don't create a market because there's nothing above it, in a sense.\n\n3:17:47.680 --> 3:17:51.480\n It is the context that allows markets to be created.\n\n3:17:51.480 --> 3:17:54.320\n Once you market it, markets fall apart.\n\n3:17:54.320 --> 3:17:55.320\n So hold on a second.\n\n3:17:55.320 --> 3:17:56.320\n Hold on.\n\n3:17:56.320 --> 3:17:58.980\n So you think that law could be a market?\n\n3:17:58.980 --> 3:18:00.260\n And it already is a market.\n\n3:18:00.260 --> 3:18:02.180\n And we see it, for example, eBay.\n\n3:18:02.180 --> 3:18:05.320\n If I am buying something from Yaron, I won't even know his name.\n\n3:18:05.320 --> 3:18:06.320\n I don't know.\n\n3:18:06.320 --> 3:18:08.200\n Maybe he's in another country.\n\n3:18:08.200 --> 3:18:11.640\n And he screws me out of the money.\n\n3:18:11.640 --> 3:18:12.640\n I can't sue you.\n\n3:18:12.640 --> 3:18:15.240\n Or if I sue you in England, good luck with that.\n\n3:18:15.240 --> 3:18:16.840\n You're not going to argue that I'm going to sue you.\n\n3:18:16.840 --> 3:18:21.360\n What happens in this case, which has already been solved by the market, eBay and PayPal,\n\n3:18:21.360 --> 3:18:24.720\n which has access to your bank account, they act as the private arbiter.\n\n3:18:24.720 --> 3:18:27.000\n They're going to get it wrong a lot.\n\n3:18:27.000 --> 3:18:30.960\n Not even a question, just like Yaron's not going to argue that the government right now\n\n3:18:30.960 --> 3:18:31.960\n gets it wrong a lot.\n\n3:18:31.960 --> 3:18:32.960\n That's not even a question.\n\n3:18:32.960 --> 3:18:38.600\n The point is, at the very least, I'm going to get my resolution faster, cheaper, and\n\n3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:39.880\n more effectively.\n\n3:18:39.880 --> 3:18:44.040\n So the issue with having any kind of government, anything, and Yaron's not going to disagree\n\n3:18:44.040 --> 3:18:50.200\n with this, is at the very least, it's going to be expensive, inefficient, and cause conflict.\n\n3:18:50.200 --> 3:18:53.040\n Yeah, but I think what it allows is exactly...\n\n3:18:53.040 --> 3:18:55.880\n We don't even know what the Supreme Court's going to judge.\n\n3:18:55.880 --> 3:18:59.400\n Again, you're moving us to today's environment, which I'm against.\n\n3:18:59.400 --> 3:19:00.880\n I'm moving us to reality.\n\n3:19:00.880 --> 3:19:03.440\n No, but reality doesn't have to be what it is.\n\n3:19:03.440 --> 3:19:04.440\n I mean, go ahead.\n\n3:19:04.440 --> 3:19:05.920\n That's the most anti Iran quote.\n\n3:19:05.920 --> 3:19:10.280\n No, in a sense of the politics, the political reality.\n\n3:19:10.280 --> 3:19:11.640\n I know, but the quote by itself is great.\n\n3:19:11.640 --> 3:19:12.640\n I know.\n\n3:19:12.640 --> 3:19:13.640\n I know.\n\n3:19:13.640 --> 3:19:14.640\n You'd love to...\n\n3:19:14.640 --> 3:19:15.640\n He agrees with Donald Hoffman is what he said.\n\n3:19:15.640 --> 3:19:16.640\n Yeah, it turns out I agree with Hoffman.\n\n3:19:16.640 --> 3:19:18.200\n He's an elf.\n\n3:19:18.200 --> 3:19:19.200\n So it's...\n\n3:19:19.200 --> 3:19:20.840\n Where were we?\n\n3:19:20.840 --> 3:19:26.400\n So I believe that because we have a certain system of government, it allows for these\n\n3:19:26.400 --> 3:19:32.640\n private innovations to come about that facilitates certain issues in a much more efficient way\n\n3:19:32.640 --> 3:19:34.000\n than the government would deal with it.\n\n3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:40.240\n But it's only because we have a particular system that has defined property rights, that\n\n3:19:40.240 --> 3:19:45.640\n has a clear view of what property rights are, it has a clear view of what a transaction\n\n3:19:45.640 --> 3:19:51.080\n mean or what contract law is, and eBay has a bunch of stuff that you sign, whether you\n\n3:19:51.080 --> 3:19:52.080\n read it or not.\n\n3:19:52.080 --> 3:19:53.080\n Of course.\n\n3:19:53.080 --> 3:20:00.120\n The fact is defined first, and then there are massive innovations at the level of particular\n\n3:20:00.120 --> 3:20:05.320\n transactions at the level of an eBay that facilitate increased efficiency.\n\n3:20:05.320 --> 3:20:06.320\n And that's great.\n\n3:20:06.320 --> 3:20:08.560\n But the fact is none of that gets developed.\n\n3:20:08.560 --> 3:20:10.180\n None of that gets created.\n\n3:20:10.180 --> 3:20:14.680\n In a world in which I might be living under different definition of property rights, eBay\n\n3:20:14.680 --> 3:20:16.760\n might be living under separate definition of property rights.\n\n3:20:16.760 --> 3:20:20.800\n You might have a third definition of property rights, and there's no mechanism by which\n\n3:20:20.800 --> 3:20:24.920\n we can actually operationalize that because we all have a different system.\n\n3:20:24.920 --> 3:20:25.920\n There is a mechanism.\n\n3:20:25.920 --> 3:20:27.000\n We already have that.\n\n3:20:27.000 --> 3:20:28.880\n Let's change the example I just used.\n\n3:20:28.880 --> 3:20:34.240\n What happens if a Chinese person who has different definition of property rights kills an American\n\n3:20:34.240 --> 3:20:35.240\n in Brazil?\n\n3:20:35.240 --> 3:20:39.920\n Again, in a smaller community, what happens is lots of violence.\n\n3:20:39.920 --> 3:20:41.800\n No, but I'm talking right now.\n\n3:20:41.800 --> 3:20:42.960\n A Chinese person has...\n\n3:20:42.960 --> 3:20:47.200\n Right now, the only reason that it doesn't lead to violence is because people are afraid\n\n3:20:47.200 --> 3:20:52.200\n of even more violence, and it affects many people, large numbers of people who don't\n\n3:20:52.200 --> 3:20:53.400\n want to go to war.\n\n3:20:53.400 --> 3:20:56.860\n But if you have small...\n\n3:20:56.860 --> 3:21:01.720\n In a state where the states were small, in those little states, there was war all the\n\n3:21:01.720 --> 3:21:08.640\n time for exactly those reasons, because the cost was lower, because it was more personal,\n\n3:21:08.640 --> 3:21:13.000\n because I knew maybe the person who was killed over there, and I went to my king and encouraged\n\n3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:14.000\n him to go to war.\n\n3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:15.000\n You know why there was war?\n\n3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:16.000\n Violence is constant.\n\n3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:17.040\n You know why there was war?\n\n3:21:17.040 --> 3:21:23.520\n Because there had been no Ayn Rand, and good ideas lead to good societies, which leads\n\n3:21:23.520 --> 3:21:26.960\n to good people, which leads to good behavior, good interrelationships.\n\n3:21:26.960 --> 3:21:31.400\n So now that we have Ayn Rand, all this stuff in the past is irrelevant, because if they\n\n3:21:31.400 --> 3:21:33.800\n studied her works, we would be...\n\n3:21:33.800 --> 3:21:39.720\n Rand was on Donahue again, you could watch the clip, and he asks her, she goes...\n\n3:21:39.720 --> 3:21:44.640\n He goes, you're saying that if we were more selfish and acted more self interest, there'd\n\n3:21:44.640 --> 3:21:46.880\n be less war, less Hitler?\n\n3:21:46.880 --> 3:21:48.920\n And she said, there wouldn't be any.\n\n3:21:48.920 --> 3:21:49.920\n Right?\n\n3:21:49.920 --> 3:21:50.920\n That's right.\n\n3:21:50.920 --> 3:21:53.560\n Well, if we were all selfish, there wouldn't be any Hitlers, right?\n\n3:21:53.560 --> 3:22:00.960\n But who do you regard as the overweening authority if I am buying a product from you as someone\n\n3:22:00.960 --> 3:22:02.680\n in England via eBay?\n\n3:22:02.680 --> 3:22:05.200\n Who's the governing authority?\n\n3:22:05.200 --> 3:22:10.000\n The governing authority are the legal systems in England and the United States, which have\n\n3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:11.800\n to be synchronized pretty well.\n\n3:22:11.800 --> 3:22:12.800\n Right.\n\n3:22:12.800 --> 3:22:17.160\n So why eBay doesn't function in certain countries, because there is no legal system.\n\n3:22:17.160 --> 3:22:18.160\n I agree with you.\n\n3:22:18.160 --> 3:22:22.840\n My point is, why do those legal systems have to be a function specifically of geography,\n\n3:22:22.840 --> 3:22:25.840\n as opposed to, why can't I sitting here...\n\n3:22:25.840 --> 3:22:27.880\n I could sit here, you're not going to let me finish my point.\n\n3:22:27.880 --> 3:22:31.740\n I can sit here and be a British diplomat, right?\n\n3:22:31.740 --> 3:22:35.560\n And as a British diplomat, I'm going to be treated differently under American law than\n\n3:22:35.560 --> 3:22:37.680\n you are as an American citizen as you are.\n\n3:22:37.680 --> 3:22:43.360\n Why can't you have that same process, sure, we're geographically proximate, but I'm a\n\n3:22:43.360 --> 3:22:47.240\n citizen of this company and you're a citizen of that company?\n\n3:22:47.240 --> 3:22:49.960\n Why would that be different in your opinion?\n\n3:22:49.960 --> 3:22:55.440\n If it's England and the United States, it's probably not going to matter that much, right?\n\n3:22:55.440 --> 3:23:00.740\n But if it's Iran and the United States, then the fact that we're sitting next to each other\n\n3:23:00.740 --> 3:23:01.740\n makes a huge difference.\n\n3:23:01.740 --> 3:23:02.740\n Oh, I...\n\n3:23:02.740 --> 3:23:03.740\n Massive difference.\n\n3:23:03.740 --> 3:23:08.120\n The fact is that, and Ayn Rand, I think would be the first technologist and this is why\n\n3:23:08.120 --> 3:23:10.720\n she was so opposed to anarchy.\n\n3:23:10.720 --> 3:23:11.720\n It's not...\n\n3:23:11.720 --> 3:23:12.720\n That's not why.\n\n3:23:12.720 --> 3:23:13.720\n It is why.\n\n3:23:13.720 --> 3:23:14.720\n It's because of Rothbard.\n\n3:23:14.720 --> 3:23:15.720\n No, it has nothing to do with...\n\n3:23:15.720 --> 3:23:16.720\n Nothing?\n\n3:23:16.720 --> 3:23:17.720\n It has nothing to do with Rothbard.\n\n3:23:17.720 --> 3:23:18.720\n Nothing.\n\n3:23:18.720 --> 3:23:19.720\n Nothing.\n\n3:23:19.720 --> 3:23:20.720\n How do you know?\n\n3:23:20.720 --> 3:23:21.720\n Nothing.\n\n3:23:21.720 --> 3:23:22.720\n How would you know?\n\n3:23:22.720 --> 3:23:23.720\n Because her argument against anarchy is an intellectual one, not a personality based\n\n3:23:23.720 --> 3:23:24.720\n one.\n\n3:23:24.720 --> 3:23:25.720\n Can't it be both?\n\n3:23:25.720 --> 3:23:26.720\n Anyway, but back to it, back to Iran.\n\n3:23:26.720 --> 3:23:27.720\n No, it has nothing to do with Rothbard.\n\n3:23:27.720 --> 3:23:33.200\n You don't know that, you're not a psychic or a necromancer.\n\n3:23:33.200 --> 3:23:36.500\n The only way we're going to resolve this is arm wrestling, right?\n\n3:23:36.500 --> 3:23:37.500\n It's through violence.\n\n3:23:37.500 --> 3:23:40.160\n Arm wrestling is not violence.\n\n3:23:40.160 --> 3:23:41.160\n Words are violence.\n\n3:23:41.160 --> 3:23:42.160\n Words are violence, everyone.\n\n3:23:42.160 --> 3:23:43.160\n Words are violence.\n\n3:23:43.160 --> 3:23:44.160\n Emotions are violence.\n\n3:23:44.160 --> 3:23:48.600\n He throws me off with this stuff.\n\n3:23:48.600 --> 3:23:49.600\n That's the problem.\n\n3:23:49.600 --> 3:23:50.600\n Even facts and truth?\n\n3:23:50.600 --> 3:23:51.600\n He's very, very good.\n\n3:23:51.600 --> 3:23:52.600\n Not facts and truth.\n\n3:23:52.600 --> 3:23:56.400\n Distortions and arbitrary statements, because your statement about Rothbard is an arbitrary\n\n3:23:56.400 --> 3:24:01.040\n statement that has no cognitive standing and therefore I can dismiss it.\n\n3:24:01.040 --> 3:24:03.280\n I'm not doing like this because I want to dismiss it.\n\n3:24:03.280 --> 3:24:04.280\n It has no cognitive status.\n\n3:24:04.280 --> 3:24:09.120\n The fact that she disliked Rothbard doesn't mean that everything he said she was going\n\n3:24:09.120 --> 3:24:10.280\n to dismiss because she disliked it.\n\n3:24:10.280 --> 3:24:11.280\n I agree with you.\n\n3:24:11.280 --> 3:24:13.280\n But what I'm saying is it would not be impossible.\n\n3:24:13.280 --> 3:24:14.280\n But there's no evidence.\n\n3:24:14.280 --> 3:24:15.280\n I'll talk.\n\n3:24:15.280 --> 3:24:16.880\n I'll give you some evidence.\n\n3:24:16.880 --> 3:24:18.260\n Human psychology.\n\n3:24:18.260 --> 3:24:23.520\n It is not impossible that if you hate some... What's that guy's name?\n\n3:24:23.520 --> 3:24:24.520\n Richard Wolff.\n\n3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:25.520\n Right.\n\n3:24:25.520 --> 3:24:29.680\n It's not impossible that if Richard Wolff said something that you would otherwise agree\n\n3:24:29.680 --> 3:24:34.520\n with, hold on, let me finish, you'd be dismissive or less likely to give him credit for it being\n\n3:24:34.520 --> 3:24:35.520\n a human being.\n\n3:24:35.520 --> 3:24:36.520\n That's all I'm saying.\n\n3:24:36.520 --> 3:24:41.840\n It's as silly as to say Rothbard came up with this theory of anarchy because he was pissed\n\n3:24:41.840 --> 3:24:43.880\n off at Ayn Rand and wanted to write something.\n\n3:24:43.880 --> 3:24:44.880\n I don't know.\n\n3:24:44.880 --> 3:24:45.880\n Bring it down.\n\n3:24:45.880 --> 3:24:50.960\n Bring it down so that he can speak too and let's keep it...\n\n3:24:50.960 --> 3:24:51.960\n I don't think we're getting agitated.\n\n3:24:51.960 --> 3:24:52.960\n No, you guys aren't.\n\n3:24:52.960 --> 3:24:53.960\n No, no, no.\n\n3:24:53.960 --> 3:24:54.960\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n3:24:54.960 --> 3:25:02.920\n No, bring it down not in terms of give more pauses so Michael can insert himself.\n\n3:25:02.920 --> 3:25:03.920\n That's what I mean.\n\n3:25:03.920 --> 3:25:04.920\n See, private governance.\n\n3:25:04.920 --> 3:25:05.920\n What's the point of that?\n\n3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:06.920\n Private governance.\n\n3:25:06.920 --> 3:25:07.920\n Look.\n\n3:25:07.920 --> 3:25:08.920\n Look, it's private governance.\n\n3:25:08.920 --> 3:25:09.920\n I'm all for private governance.\n\n3:25:09.920 --> 3:25:12.320\n I'm trying to establish this geographic law of the land.\n\n3:25:12.320 --> 3:25:13.320\n I don't know.\n\n3:25:13.320 --> 3:25:14.320\n That's not the point.\n\n3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:17.440\n I do think that Michael's... I mean, that's interesting that you disagree with this.\n\n3:25:17.440 --> 3:25:23.680\n I do believe that psychology has an impact on ideas and Ayn Rand, you don't think Ayn\n\n3:25:23.680 --> 3:25:30.400\n Rand had grudges that impacted the way she saw the world?\n\n3:25:30.400 --> 3:25:31.640\n We would like to think that...\n\n3:25:31.640 --> 3:25:35.200\n I don't think any of her grudges entered into her philosophical statements, at least not\n\n3:25:35.200 --> 3:25:43.640\n that I can tell, and given the centrality Ayn Rand gave to the role of government, to\n\n3:25:43.640 --> 3:25:48.720\n the existence of government, to the need for government, to establish real freedom, and\n\n3:25:48.720 --> 3:25:53.000\n the way she defines freedom, which is very different than Rothbard, and the way she defines\n\n3:25:53.000 --> 3:26:00.480\n it, to say then that her opposition and anarchy is because of, I think, is just an arbitrary\n\n3:26:00.480 --> 3:26:01.480\n statement.\n\n3:26:01.480 --> 3:26:02.480\n I didn't say because of.\n\n3:26:02.480 --> 3:26:03.480\n I didn't say because of.\n\n3:26:03.480 --> 3:26:04.480\n I said followed by.\n\n3:26:04.480 --> 3:26:07.360\n And not, and I don't see why psychology would enter it.\n\n3:26:07.360 --> 3:26:11.320\n Now, maybe the tone in which you responded to an answer might have been motivated by\n\n3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:14.360\n that or something like that, but given the amount of thought she gave to the role of\n\n3:26:14.360 --> 3:26:19.480\n government in human society and why government was needed, and why you needed laws in order\n\n3:26:19.480 --> 3:26:27.840\n to be free, that freedom didn't proceed, you needed the right hierarchy, I think that we\n\n3:26:27.840 --> 3:26:35.240\n could say that it, give it at least a respect that she might have been wrong, but she had\n\n3:26:35.240 --> 3:26:39.440\n a particular theory that rejected anarchy, and that thought anarchy was wrong.\n\n3:26:39.440 --> 3:26:40.440\n Okay, hold on.\n\n3:26:40.440 --> 3:26:45.640\n I really resent, and I don't want to say you're doing this, the implication that if Rand was\n\n3:26:45.640 --> 3:26:49.680\n guided by her passions, that somehow is a criticism of her or lessens her.\n\n3:26:49.680 --> 3:26:52.120\n I think Rand was a very passionate person.\n\n3:26:52.120 --> 3:26:56.920\n I think she loved her husband enormously.\n\n3:26:56.920 --> 3:27:02.280\n She despised certain people enormously, and I don't think that there's anything wrong\n\n3:27:02.280 --> 3:27:03.280\n with that.\n\n3:27:03.280 --> 3:27:05.840\n I don't think she would change her philosophical position about something because she disliked\n\n3:27:05.840 --> 3:27:06.840\n somebody.\n\n3:27:06.840 --> 3:27:07.840\n I agree, but what I'm saying.\n\n3:27:07.840 --> 3:27:09.480\n Given the amount of thought she gave to that philosophical position.\n\n3:27:09.480 --> 3:27:16.300\n All I'm saying is, it is possible that if someone comes across ideas that she had not\n\n3:27:16.300 --> 3:27:22.280\n considered before, if she regarded this person as a bad actor, like all of us, she would\n\n3:27:22.280 --> 3:27:25.160\n be less likely to take them under consideration.\n\n3:27:25.160 --> 3:27:26.160\n Sure.\n\n3:27:26.160 --> 3:27:27.160\n That's all I'm saying.\n\n3:27:27.160 --> 3:27:28.160\n Sure.\n\n3:27:28.160 --> 3:27:31.080\n And I think other people confronted her with ideas of anarchy, I don't think Rothbard was\n\n3:27:31.080 --> 3:27:32.080\n the only one.\n\n3:27:32.080 --> 3:27:33.080\n Correct, Roy Charles as well, yeah.\n\n3:27:33.080 --> 3:27:34.080\n Roy Charles certainly did.\n\n3:27:34.080 --> 3:27:37.940\n And she rejected them, and she rejected them because she had, and whether you agree with\n\n3:27:37.940 --> 3:27:45.960\n or not, she had a thought out position about why you needed to have this particular structure\n\n3:27:45.960 --> 3:27:49.840\n in place so that markets and human freedom could exist.\n\n3:27:49.840 --> 3:27:54.520\n It's just really interesting because this is the one time, in my view, and please correct\n\n3:27:54.520 --> 3:28:01.120\n me if I'm wrong, where she invokes need as kind of a basis for political activity.\n\n3:28:01.120 --> 3:28:05.360\n So let's suppose you want this federal government, whatever you want, you don't want it like\n\n3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:11.560\n it is now, like your version of the government, I don't see why it's an issue for you for\n\n3:28:11.560 --> 3:28:18.240\n me and Lex to say, we're not privy to Washington, we're going to do our own thing, and given,\n\n3:28:18.240 --> 3:28:23.360\n if we go about our lives not initiating force and being productive actors, why she would\n\n3:28:23.360 --> 3:28:24.360\n have an issue with this.\n\n3:28:24.360 --> 3:28:25.360\n Why would I care?\n\n3:28:25.360 --> 3:28:28.900\n Well, you would care because if you're saying the government has a monopoly on force between\n\n3:28:28.900 --> 3:28:29.900\n these two oceans.\n\n3:28:29.900 --> 3:28:32.640\n So you can do that as long as you don't violate somebody else's rights.\n\n3:28:32.640 --> 3:28:36.120\n Sure, but what I'm saying is we just declare ourselves sovereign, we're not going to pay\n\n3:28:36.120 --> 3:28:42.600\n any income taxes, we're going to be peaceful people, and when Lex and I have disputes,\n\n3:28:42.600 --> 3:28:46.160\n we're going to call Joe, that's Joe Rogan, you're never going to get to meet him, but\n\n3:28:46.160 --> 3:28:47.160\n he's a good guy.\n\n3:28:47.160 --> 3:28:48.160\n I know.\n\n3:28:48.160 --> 3:28:51.000\n We're going to call Joe, and Joe's going to resolve it.\n\n3:28:51.000 --> 3:28:57.240\n He's so good at like, you know, needling and getting you off topic that way.\n\n3:28:57.240 --> 3:29:00.560\n He's really effective at it.\n\n3:29:00.560 --> 3:29:04.840\n I always say, when I debate communists, I always say to them...\n\n3:29:04.840 --> 3:29:05.840\n You mean Lex?\n\n3:29:05.840 --> 3:29:07.200\n Yeah, maybe Lex.\n\n3:29:07.200 --> 3:29:08.200\n Maybe I should...\n\n3:29:08.200 --> 3:29:10.000\n Comrade, I love you.\n\n3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:11.000\n That if they really believe...\n\n3:29:11.000 --> 3:29:12.000\n Burgundy, not red.\n\n3:29:12.000 --> 3:29:15.840\n If they really believe in what they think, then they should be advocates of capitalism,\n\n3:29:15.840 --> 3:29:19.860\n because under capitalism, under my system of government, capitalist government, right,\n\n3:29:19.860 --> 3:29:23.920\n they could go and start a commune, they can live with communists, they can live to each\n\n3:29:23.920 --> 3:29:29.840\n according to his needs, from each according to his ability, all they want, and live their\n\n3:29:29.840 --> 3:29:34.080\n pathetic miserable lives that way, and the government would never intervene, because\n\n3:29:34.080 --> 3:29:38.760\n the whole view of capitalism is freedom, is we leave it alone, right?\n\n3:29:38.760 --> 3:29:42.060\n As long as you're not violating my rights, as long as you're not taking my property,\n\n3:29:42.060 --> 3:29:45.120\n as long as you're not engaging with...\n\n3:29:45.120 --> 3:29:49.440\n So in that sense, yeah, you and Lex can form your own thing, I don't believe in compulsory\n\n3:29:49.440 --> 3:29:55.280\n taxes anyway, so you and Lex can do your own thing, never pay taxes, as long as you're\n\n3:29:55.280 --> 3:29:59.120\n not violating the laws, and the laws are very limited, right, because they're only there\n\n3:29:59.120 --> 3:30:02.080\n to protect individual rights, so as long as you're not violating somebody else's property\n\n3:30:02.080 --> 3:30:07.360\n rights or inflicting force on anybody else, you're peaceful, you can do what you want,\n\n3:30:07.360 --> 3:30:08.360\n you know, don't have...\n\n3:30:08.360 --> 3:30:09.360\n Great.\n\n3:30:09.360 --> 3:30:10.360\n Yeah.\n\n3:30:10.360 --> 3:30:11.360\n Great.\n\n3:30:11.360 --> 3:30:12.360\n Case placed.\n\n3:30:12.360 --> 3:30:13.360\n Don't have sex with kids, right?\n\n3:30:13.360 --> 3:30:14.360\n I will stop immediately.\n\n3:30:14.360 --> 3:30:15.360\n Good.\n\n3:30:15.360 --> 3:30:16.360\n The rest of us are just playing checkers and he's playing chess.\n\n3:30:16.360 --> 3:30:20.320\n Yeah, I mean, a government that protects individual rights properly is a government\n\n3:30:20.320 --> 3:30:23.640\n that leaves you alone to live your life as you see fit, even if you live your life in\n\n3:30:23.640 --> 3:30:27.280\n a way that I don't approve of, that I don't think is right, I mean, that's the whole point,\n\n3:30:27.280 --> 3:30:28.280\n right?\n\n3:30:28.280 --> 3:30:35.280\n So the only thing you can do is, you know, try to enforce arbitrary laws that you come\n\n3:30:35.280 --> 3:30:36.280\n up with on me.\n\n3:30:36.280 --> 3:30:37.280\n Sure.\n\n3:30:37.280 --> 3:30:38.280\n Of course.\n\n3:30:38.280 --> 3:30:39.280\n Absolutely.\n\n3:30:39.280 --> 3:30:40.280\n Okay, great.\n\n3:30:40.280 --> 3:30:45.240\n Wouldn't it be wonderful if we lived in a world where rights protecting laws are superfluous,\n\n3:30:45.240 --> 3:30:52.480\n but the reality is usually that somebody violates them, whether by accident or intentionally,\n\n3:30:52.480 --> 3:30:57.400\n and that you need some mechanism, now if you guys can resolve that dispute without getting\n\n3:30:57.400 --> 3:30:58.860\n involved, fine.\n\n3:30:58.860 --> 3:31:04.760\n But if you guys land up not resolving, there is another authority that will help you resolve\n\n3:31:04.760 --> 3:31:05.760\n it.\n\n3:31:05.760 --> 3:31:06.760\n Yeah, our company.\n\n3:31:06.760 --> 3:31:07.760\n So can I ask you a question?\n\n3:31:07.760 --> 3:31:12.960\n Under anarchism, what kind of systems of laws do you think will emerge?\n\n3:31:12.960 --> 3:31:18.200\n Do you think we'll have basically a similar kind of layer of universal law to where, like...\n\n3:31:18.200 --> 3:31:19.200\n Let me answer this.\n\n3:31:19.200 --> 3:31:20.200\n This is a great question.\n\n3:31:20.200 --> 3:31:21.900\n I know what you're going with this.\n\n3:31:21.900 --> 3:31:26.340\n This is often presented as a criticism of anarchism, and this is actually something\n\n3:31:26.340 --> 3:31:30.240\n I think Yaron would agree with as well in other contexts, which is this.\n\n3:31:30.240 --> 3:31:34.600\n One of the reasons communism can't work, central planning can't work, and this was one of Mises's\n\n3:31:34.600 --> 3:31:40.020\n great innovations, is if I could sit down, it's like asking, what would the fashion industry\n\n3:31:40.020 --> 3:31:42.540\n look like if the government didn't run it?\n\n3:31:42.540 --> 3:31:44.040\n There's no way for me to know.\n\n3:31:44.040 --> 3:31:48.240\n What the fashion industry is, which all of us are in favor of it being free, is literally\n\n3:31:48.240 --> 3:31:55.640\n millions of designers, of seamstresses, of people who make the fabric, also references\n\n3:31:55.640 --> 3:32:01.920\n throughout history, and these creative artistic minds putting things together in every year.\n\n3:32:01.920 --> 3:32:03.440\n There's no shortage of clothes.\n\n3:32:03.440 --> 3:32:08.840\n In fact, we make so many clothes that we send them in landfill sizes to overseas poor countries,\n\n3:32:08.840 --> 3:32:11.600\n and you have people in these destitute countries wearing Adidas shirts.\n\n3:32:11.600 --> 3:32:15.260\n They can't even read English, but because we don't know what to do with all these clothes.\n\n3:32:15.260 --> 3:32:18.360\n That's how the glory of free enterprise is.\n\n3:32:18.360 --> 3:32:23.960\n The problem is, problem using this loosely, everything comes cheap and overabundant, like\n\n3:32:23.960 --> 3:32:24.960\n food.\n\n3:32:24.960 --> 3:32:28.320\n Well, it doesn't actually come overabundant, but it's done properly.\n\n3:32:28.320 --> 3:32:29.320\n That's fair.\n\n3:32:29.320 --> 3:32:30.320\n Supply meets demand.\n\n3:32:30.320 --> 3:32:31.320\n Sure.\n\n3:32:31.320 --> 3:32:32.320\n That's fair.\n\n3:32:32.320 --> 3:32:34.680\n What I'm saying is, if 150 years ago you said, you know, one day we're going to have an issue\n\n3:32:34.680 --> 3:32:38.720\n where there's going to be so much food and then the kids are too fat.\n\n3:32:38.720 --> 3:32:42.360\n It's just going to be like, I have four who are dead in the crib.\n\n3:32:42.360 --> 3:32:43.360\n I wish.\n\n3:32:43.360 --> 3:32:47.240\n I mean, what kind of paradise is this?\n\n3:32:47.240 --> 3:32:52.160\n What you would have, we have this right now in certain senses, you have the Hasidim, you\n\n3:32:52.160 --> 3:32:58.000\n have Sharia, I'm sure in the medical system, they have their own kind of private courts\n\n3:32:58.000 --> 3:33:01.520\n and court marshals is another example of this, although obviously that's through the state.\n\n3:33:01.520 --> 3:33:07.840\n So you would have innovation in law, under markets, just the same ways you'd have it.\n\n3:33:07.840 --> 3:33:09.380\n And we have this already.\n\n3:33:09.380 --> 3:33:13.600\n Maybe it's not, Yaron doesn't like in terms of murder and rape and I can understand why,\n\n3:33:13.600 --> 3:33:18.960\n but in terms of business and interactions, he would have no problem with different arbitration\n\n3:33:18.960 --> 3:33:22.800\n firms, having different rules for what kind of evidence is allowed.\n\n3:33:22.800 --> 3:33:25.920\n Maybe you only have 60 days to make your case and so on and so forth.\n\n3:33:25.920 --> 3:33:30.120\n And the market is a process of creative innovation and it would be dynamic.\n\n3:33:30.120 --> 3:33:31.120\n It would be changing.\n\n3:33:31.120 --> 3:33:35.500\n So what's interesting relating to this is that one of the ways Ayn Rand proposed raising\n\n3:33:35.500 --> 3:33:41.160\n revenue for the government, because she was against, was let's say we have a contract.\n\n3:33:41.160 --> 3:33:47.200\n We could just have it arbitrated without government interfering, but if we wanted to access the\n\n3:33:47.200 --> 3:33:51.320\n courts of the government as a final authority, we would pay.\n\n3:33:51.320 --> 3:33:55.620\n And that's how governments would raise, some of the funds would be raised that way.\n\n3:33:55.620 --> 3:34:02.040\n So there's definitely a value to having this innovation and the public space.\n\n3:34:02.040 --> 3:34:04.680\n But I don't believe that is the case with murder.\n\n3:34:04.680 --> 3:34:07.120\n I don't believe that is the case with violent crime.\n\n3:34:07.120 --> 3:34:10.560\n And it's funny you bring up Sharia because David Friedman, when he gives, when he gives\n\n3:34:10.560 --> 3:34:12.120\n Wait, I got to ask you to clarify.\n\n3:34:12.120 --> 3:34:13.120\n I'm not trying to interrupt you.\n\n3:34:13.120 --> 3:34:14.360\n You were talking about with murder.\n\n3:34:14.360 --> 3:34:19.720\n I mean, you would agree, I think just to clarify for the audience, that there is room for innovation\n\n3:34:19.720 --> 3:34:21.240\n and murder because there's things like matter of slaughter.\n\n3:34:21.240 --> 3:34:22.240\n There's murder one, murder two.\n\n3:34:22.240 --> 3:34:23.240\n Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n3:34:23.240 --> 3:34:26.080\n I don't think it happens at a market level.\n\n3:34:26.080 --> 3:34:28.760\n I don't think there's a market innovation for murder.\n\n3:34:28.760 --> 3:34:32.520\n Somebody has to figure out what those standards are and they will evolve as we gain more knowledge.\n\n3:34:32.520 --> 3:34:36.360\n But we're all in agreement that the word murder means very different things.\n\n3:34:36.360 --> 3:34:37.360\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n3:34:37.360 --> 3:34:43.120\n And if circumstances matter and standards of proof and standards of evidence, all of\n\n3:34:43.120 --> 3:34:45.120\n that, there has to be a standard.\n\n3:34:45.120 --> 3:34:46.640\n All of that, there has to be a standard.\n\n3:34:46.640 --> 3:34:52.160\n And that's what I think a proper government provides.\n\n3:34:52.160 --> 3:34:59.160\n So David Friedman uses, in some of his talks about private law, he uses Sharia law in Somalia\n\n3:34:59.160 --> 3:35:00.160\n as an example.\n\n3:35:00.160 --> 3:35:07.040\n Look, legal systems evolve privately, independent, yeah, authoritarian ones, ones that don't\n\n3:35:07.040 --> 3:35:08.840\n respect the rights of women at all.\n\n3:35:08.840 --> 3:35:09.840\n Are you married?\n\n3:35:09.840 --> 3:35:10.840\n No, no.\n\n3:35:10.840 --> 3:35:14.240\n But we all want to have sex with our mother, as Freud would say.\n\n3:35:14.240 --> 3:35:15.240\n Oh my God.\n\n3:35:15.240 --> 3:35:16.720\n Can we make that a clip?\n\n3:35:16.720 --> 3:35:17.720\n Yeah.\n\n3:35:17.720 --> 3:35:20.360\n Where the hell did that come from?\n\n3:35:20.360 --> 3:35:23.040\n That's much better than what I was just saying about the kids.\n\n3:35:23.040 --> 3:35:24.040\n I appreciate that.\n\n3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:25.040\n Okay.\n\n3:35:25.040 --> 3:35:29.880\n So we went in a voluntary way, although sometimes for Yaron and sometimes for Michael it felt\n\n3:35:29.880 --> 3:35:34.400\n involuntary, but we all got the big guns.\n\n3:35:34.400 --> 3:35:37.600\n So how do we land this?\n\n3:35:37.600 --> 3:35:41.480\n Obviously there's a disagreement about anarchism here.\n\n3:35:41.480 --> 3:35:44.000\n I think there's a big agreement.\n\n3:35:44.000 --> 3:35:48.720\n Because if Yaron was saying that if I want to have my voluntary stupid thing with you,\n\n3:35:48.720 --> 3:35:53.080\n and his government is not going to tax me, and is not going to insinuate itself unless\n\n3:35:53.080 --> 3:35:56.000\n we're murdering each other, something like that, I'm okay with that.\n\n3:35:56.000 --> 3:35:59.800\n So if you take the example of Sharia law, which was mentioned earlier.\n\n3:35:59.800 --> 3:36:06.080\n So if you have a little community within this, within my world, right, that imposes Sharia\n\n3:36:06.080 --> 3:36:15.440\n law, if it starts mutilating little girls, then you impose your law on it, right?\n\n3:36:15.440 --> 3:36:18.640\n You impose the law on it because it's an issue of protecting individual rights.\n\n3:36:18.640 --> 3:36:24.000\n If they want to treat women, if women have to cover up, and the women are okay with that,\n\n3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:25.000\n that's fine.\n\n3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:29.380\n If the woman wants to leave but is not allowed to leave, that's where my government would\n\n3:36:29.380 --> 3:36:35.680\n step in and prevent them from using force against her.\n\n3:36:35.680 --> 3:36:37.640\n And that's it, right?\n\n3:36:37.640 --> 3:36:39.920\n Now I think it's more complicated than that, right?\n\n3:36:39.920 --> 3:36:44.760\n Because I think there are complex issue property rights often where it's not going to be easy\n\n3:36:44.760 --> 3:36:48.600\n for you guys to resolve, and particularly if you interact with people outside of your\n\n3:36:48.600 --> 3:36:49.600\n community.\n\n3:36:49.600 --> 3:36:50.600\n Sure.\n\n3:36:50.600 --> 3:36:56.120\n But yeah, my view is government is there to protect individual rights.\n\n3:36:56.120 --> 3:36:57.120\n That's it.\n\n3:36:57.120 --> 3:36:58.340\n Otherwise, leave you alone.\n\n3:36:58.340 --> 3:37:02.440\n I think this conversation is going to continue for quite a while.\n\n3:37:02.440 --> 3:37:06.680\n Israel has a new book on the topic coming out eventually, one day.\n\n3:37:06.680 --> 3:37:09.800\n So you're working also on the, still called the White Pill?\n\n3:37:09.800 --> 3:37:10.800\n The White Pill, yeah.\n\n3:37:10.800 --> 3:37:16.920\n And the first line of the White Pill is, Ayn Rand did not laugh.\n\n3:37:16.920 --> 3:37:17.920\n I'm not joking.\n\n3:37:17.920 --> 3:37:18.920\n That's literally the first line.\n\n3:37:18.920 --> 3:37:19.920\n I believe it.\n\n3:37:19.920 --> 3:37:23.160\n Because it opens up with her, who knows what the book's going to look like when it's done,\n\n3:37:23.160 --> 3:37:27.760\n but as of now, that's the beginning, because it opens up with her testimony at the House\n\n3:37:27.760 --> 3:37:33.560\n UnAmerican Activities Committee, where she's trying to explain to these congresspeople\n\n3:37:33.560 --> 3:37:38.760\n what it was like when she left the Soviet Union, and they are just befuddled by it.\n\n3:37:38.760 --> 3:37:40.280\n Can you explain she did not laugh?\n\n3:37:40.280 --> 3:37:43.960\n Well, because the first line of the Fountainhead, spoiler alert, is Howard Rourke laughed.\n\n3:37:43.960 --> 3:37:45.560\n So this is a little inversion of that.\n\n3:37:45.560 --> 3:37:53.900\n It says Ayn Rand did not laugh, because Ayn Rand was a huge fan of America, as am I.\n\n3:37:53.900 --> 3:37:57.520\n She took our political system very seriously.\n\n3:37:57.520 --> 3:38:00.160\n She had enormous reverence for institutions.\n\n3:38:00.160 --> 3:38:06.720\n One example of this is one of the villains of the Atlas Shrugged is based on Harry Truman.\n\n3:38:06.720 --> 3:38:08.880\n I think Thompson is the character's name.\n\n3:38:08.880 --> 3:38:13.600\n And because she had such respect for the title of president, she refers to him as the chairman.\n\n3:38:13.600 --> 3:38:14.600\n She couldn't even bring herself...\n\n3:38:14.600 --> 3:38:17.160\n She had a huge respect for the presidency.\n\n3:38:17.160 --> 3:38:20.840\n I wonder if she'd still have it, given the last string of presidents we've had.\n\n3:38:20.840 --> 3:38:27.360\n So having her, which sets up the broader point of the book, which I'm sure I'll be back on\n\n3:38:27.360 --> 3:38:32.160\n the show to discuss, assuming this bridge hasn't been burned, but I'll try my best.\n\n3:38:32.160 --> 3:38:34.480\n All three of us are canceled.\n\n3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:36.160\n Some are more canceled than the others.\n\n3:38:36.160 --> 3:38:37.160\n Uh oh.\n\n3:38:37.160 --> 3:38:38.160\n I don't know.\n\n3:38:38.160 --> 3:38:39.160\n I'm looking at you, Michael.\n\n3:38:39.160 --> 3:38:45.960\n And the point being, which sets up the broader point of the book, is how ignorant many people\n\n3:38:45.960 --> 3:38:53.280\n are in the West about the horrors of Stalinism and communism, but also how many people in\n\n3:38:53.280 --> 3:39:02.320\n the West were complicit in saying to Americans, go home, everything's fine, this is great,\n\n3:39:02.320 --> 3:39:05.920\n sure, you know, this is why pensions have a race, they're sure they're mistakes.\n\n3:39:05.920 --> 3:39:13.600\n And they really made a point to downplay really gratuitously some of the unimaginable atrocities\n\n3:39:13.600 --> 3:39:15.280\n of the communism.\n\n3:39:15.280 --> 3:39:20.880\n And just one more sentence, and going through the work and learning about what they actually\n\n3:39:20.880 --> 3:39:28.400\n did is so jaw dropping that it's, and if I didn't know about it, many people I'm friends\n\n3:39:28.400 --> 3:39:32.320\n with who are historians who entered the space, you know, this isn't common knowledge to them,\n\n3:39:32.320 --> 3:39:35.200\n then we can assume that almost no one knows about it.\n\n3:39:35.200 --> 3:39:40.760\n And I think it's very important for people to appreciate whether Republican, Democrat,\n\n3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:45.160\n liberal, whatever, how much of a danger this is.\n\n3:39:45.160 --> 3:39:49.400\n And I think Americans have this, there's a book called It Can't Happen Here, I think\n\n3:39:49.400 --> 3:39:53.280\n by Sinclair Lewis about a fascism coming to America.\n\n3:39:53.280 --> 3:39:57.600\n American exceptionalism has a positive context, but also a negative context where you think\n\n3:39:57.600 --> 3:40:01.020\n we're invincible, all these horrible things that happen in these other countries, it can't\n\n3:40:01.020 --> 3:40:06.440\n possibly happen here, we're America, we're special, and it's completely an absurdity.\n\n3:40:06.440 --> 3:40:07.440\n Yeah.\n\n3:40:07.440 --> 3:40:10.040\n Have you seen the movie, Mr. Jones?\n\n3:40:10.040 --> 3:40:15.680\n My friend wrote it, no I haven't, but Walter Durante and his quotes, I have a thread on\n\n3:40:15.680 --> 3:40:16.680\n Twitter.\n\n3:40:16.680 --> 3:40:22.560\n For those who don't know, he won a Pulitzer because he was the New York Times man in Moscow.\n\n3:40:22.560 --> 3:40:29.960\n And endlessly, he was talking about how great it was, how if you hear about this famine\n\n3:40:29.960 --> 3:40:35.140\n in Ukraine, this is just propaganda, I went to the villages, you know, everyone's happy\n\n3:40:35.140 --> 3:40:36.360\n and fed.\n\n3:40:36.360 --> 3:40:42.160\n A lot of it was explicit lies, you know, and when you realize you're talking about, let's\n\n3:40:42.160 --> 3:40:49.440\n give them the absolute benefit of the doubt, an accidental genocide, it's still mind boggling.\n\n3:40:49.440 --> 3:40:54.160\n And also, you know, Ann Applebaum, who's just a phenomenal, phenomenal writer, she wrote\n\n3:40:54.160 --> 3:40:59.680\n a book called Red Famine, Stalin's War in Ukraine, and she talks about how what people\n\n3:40:59.680 --> 3:41:06.960\n in America don't appreciate is how clever in their sadism the Soviets were.\n\n3:41:06.960 --> 3:41:11.880\n And what they knew to do to Ukraine is everyone is starving, so they knew if you got some\n\n3:41:11.880 --> 3:41:14.360\n meat on your bones, you're hiding food.\n\n3:41:14.360 --> 3:41:18.680\n So they come back at night, take your hand, put in the door jam, keep slamming the door,\n\n3:41:18.680 --> 3:41:19.680\n ransack your house.\n\n3:41:19.680 --> 3:41:24.480\n They didn't have to find the food, burn down your house, take all your clothes, goodbye\n\n3:41:24.480 --> 3:41:25.480\n and good luck.\n\n3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:26.480\n I don't recall saying good luck.\n\n3:41:26.480 --> 3:41:27.480\n Yeah.\n\n3:41:27.480 --> 3:41:31.400\n So I highly recommend the movie because it's very well done.\n\n3:41:31.400 --> 3:41:37.800\n It's very well directed, it's beautifully made, it's stunningly effective in illustrating\n\n3:41:37.800 --> 3:41:38.800\n exactly that.\n\n3:41:38.800 --> 3:41:44.320\n When you're in Ukraine during the famine, oh, your heart goes, I mean, it's crushing.\n\n3:41:44.320 --> 3:41:45.640\n And it shifts to black and white.\n\n3:41:45.640 --> 3:41:49.320\n It's very, very well made aesthetically, so highly recommend.\n\n3:41:49.320 --> 3:41:53.040\n And it's written by Andriusha Lupa, she's a Ukrainian friend of mine, she introduced\n\n3:41:53.040 --> 3:41:57.040\n me, Yanmi Park, who's a big North Korean defector.\n\n3:41:57.040 --> 3:42:01.920\n And this is the kind of thing where I think more people need to...\n\n3:42:01.920 --> 3:42:06.760\n When I wrote the new write, which talks a lot about the Nazis or the kind of neo Nazis,\n\n3:42:06.760 --> 3:42:11.600\n on their big complaints against people who are Jewish, she's like, oh, we hear all about\n\n3:42:11.600 --> 3:42:12.600\n the Holocaust.\n\n3:42:12.600 --> 3:42:13.600\n How come you don't talk about the Holodomor?\n\n3:42:13.600 --> 3:42:15.120\n I'm like, I'm trying to do my part.\n\n3:42:15.120 --> 3:42:18.840\n I agree with you that we need to be talking more about the Holodomor.\n\n3:42:18.840 --> 3:42:19.840\n Absolutely.\n\n3:42:19.840 --> 3:42:24.240\n And it's sad, there are more movies that are anti Soviet, which tells you a lot about the\n\n3:42:24.240 --> 3:42:26.400\n view of the intelligentsia.\n\n3:42:26.400 --> 3:42:29.060\n It's a great idea, it just was badly implemented.\n\n3:42:29.060 --> 3:42:34.440\n And no, it's a rotten idea, it's an evil idea, and it was implemented exactly how it has\n\n3:42:34.440 --> 3:42:35.440\n to be implemented.\n\n3:42:35.440 --> 3:42:37.520\n There's no alternative.\n\n3:42:37.520 --> 3:42:44.240\n Can we talk about The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and which character do you find\n\n3:42:44.240 --> 3:42:49.720\n most fascinating, ones that kind of you meet in your own mind, that you almost have conversations\n\n3:42:49.720 --> 3:42:54.080\n with or has an influence on you and your life in general?\n\n3:42:54.080 --> 3:42:58.480\n You know what character I like, because I know no one ever gives this answer, but this\n\n3:42:58.480 --> 3:43:00.320\n is my...\n\n3:43:00.320 --> 3:43:04.240\n Just aesthetically, you know how sometimes you're drawn to a character and if this person\n\n3:43:04.240 --> 3:43:07.200\n were real, you think they're just horrible, but there's something about the resonates\n\n3:43:07.200 --> 3:43:08.200\n with you.\n\n3:43:08.200 --> 3:43:13.240\n I can't even explain this, but I love the character in Atlas Shrugged of Lillian Reardon,\n\n3:43:13.240 --> 3:43:15.040\n who is Hank Reardon's wife.\n\n3:43:15.040 --> 3:43:21.520\n And what is amazing about her, so she's his wife, he's this big industrialist innovator,\n\n3:43:21.520 --> 3:43:29.000\n and she's this like former beauty, but she's so cold and soulless that there's...\n\n3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:33.220\n I mean, I joke about, you know, Ayn Rand's vampire novels, that character is as close\n\n3:43:33.220 --> 3:43:37.120\n to a literal vampire as you're going to see in Rand.\n\n3:43:37.120 --> 3:43:42.200\n And there's just this great scene where, you know, Hank Reardon invents Reardon metal.\n\n3:43:42.200 --> 3:43:45.880\n It's this great metal, which is extremely strong, but extremely, it's like light, so\n\n3:43:45.880 --> 3:43:48.200\n this creates all these innovations.\n\n3:43:48.200 --> 3:43:52.080\n And he brings her a bracelet made of the first Reardon metal.\n\n3:43:52.080 --> 3:43:53.400\n This is his life goal.\n\n3:43:53.400 --> 3:43:55.540\n This is like Prometheus bringing fire.\n\n3:43:55.540 --> 3:43:57.520\n And she's like, what the fuck is this?\n\n3:43:57.520 --> 3:43:58.520\n You brought me diamonds.\n\n3:43:58.520 --> 3:43:59.520\n Yeah, you could have brought me diamonds.\n\n3:43:59.520 --> 3:44:00.520\n What is this shit?\n\n3:44:00.520 --> 3:44:04.360\n And then Dagny, who is another industrialist, she's a heroine, very strong female character\n\n3:44:04.360 --> 3:44:08.960\n in Atlas Shrugged, is at a party, and she goes, I got diamonds, let's trade.\n\n3:44:08.960 --> 3:44:10.640\n And Lillian's like, you want this?\n\n3:44:10.640 --> 3:44:13.480\n And she's like, yes, because that's the concretization of the human mind.\n\n3:44:13.480 --> 3:44:14.700\n These are rocks.\n\n3:44:14.700 --> 3:44:17.060\n And Lillian's like, okay, whatever.\n\n3:44:17.060 --> 3:44:24.240\n And that character is someone who has a lot of resonance in our culture, this kind of\n\n3:44:24.240 --> 3:44:25.600\n soulless...\n\n3:44:25.600 --> 3:44:31.620\n It's easy to write a soulless male figure, like Peter Keating in some ways a soulless,\n\n3:44:31.620 --> 3:44:39.200\n but that for some reason, when it's like a soulless female, it seems that much more chilling\n\n3:44:39.200 --> 3:44:40.200\n and effective.\n\n3:44:40.200 --> 3:44:43.680\n Do you not agree though, that Lillian Reardon is an amazingly very powerful figure?\n\n3:44:43.680 --> 3:44:44.680\n Powerful figure.\n\n3:44:44.680 --> 3:44:47.200\n And I think Reardon is too.\n\n3:44:47.200 --> 3:44:51.240\n And what I love about Reardon is his evolution, right?\n\n3:44:51.240 --> 3:44:52.560\n He's so flawed.\n\n3:44:52.560 --> 3:44:57.560\n He's a hero who's completely flawed, and it drives me nuts when people say, her characters\n\n3:44:57.560 --> 3:45:00.640\n are cartoonish, they never change, there's no emotion.\n\n3:45:00.640 --> 3:45:01.640\n Really?\n\n3:45:01.640 --> 3:45:03.480\n Did you read the same book I did?\n\n3:45:03.480 --> 3:45:07.120\n Because if you take Reardon, and he's struggling and he's trying to deal with Lillian and his\n\n3:45:07.120 --> 3:45:10.760\n family and all this stuff, and we know family members like this, right?\n\n3:45:10.760 --> 3:45:15.960\n I mean, who are leeches and parasites, but he's excusing them because that's what he's\n\n3:45:15.960 --> 3:45:17.200\n supposed to do.\n\n3:45:17.200 --> 3:45:23.720\n And then as he evolves to fully realize what's going on, that evolution is difficult, it's\n\n3:45:23.720 --> 3:45:24.720\n hard.\n\n3:45:24.720 --> 3:45:27.960\n Like the scene after he has sex with Dagny, of course, he gives a speech, but the speeches\n\n3:45:27.960 --> 3:45:34.400\n is such a good speech in terms of conveying his mind body split, right?\n\n3:45:34.400 --> 3:45:38.280\n He thinks he really had fun, he really enjoyed the sex, right?\n\n3:45:38.280 --> 3:45:43.280\n But he thinks it's animalistic, and he thinks it's a sign of his depravity, and he thinks,\n\n3:45:43.280 --> 3:45:48.680\n and here he is, this woman he loves, and he adores her, and he can't connect the two,\n\n3:45:48.680 --> 3:45:52.920\n he can't connect the sex with the love, he can't connect the sex with adoration, and\n\n3:45:52.920 --> 3:45:53.920\n with the values.\n\n3:45:53.920 --> 3:45:59.840\n So her characters are anything I think but cardboard characters, because I think Dagny\n\n3:45:59.840 --> 3:46:05.400\n and the scenes where she's listening to music, and gets captured by the music and the way\n\n3:46:05.400 --> 3:46:08.200\n Wren describes that, I think it's just beautiful.\n\n3:46:08.200 --> 3:46:16.360\n Or the scene, my favorite scene in Atlas is the scene where they're taking the first train\n\n3:46:16.360 --> 3:46:24.160\n ride across the John Gold Bridge, and they're in the engine room, and it's traveling through,\n\n3:46:24.160 --> 3:46:28.960\n and the way she's describing Dagny, it's almost like Dagny's having sex with the machine,\n\n3:46:28.960 --> 3:46:29.960\n right?\n\n3:46:29.960 --> 3:46:34.800\n It's so powerful emotionally, their success, the fact that they did it.\n\n3:46:34.800 --> 3:46:39.840\n Nobody told them it was impossible, and the train is going really fast, and that whole,\n\n3:46:39.840 --> 3:46:46.760\n it's got a sexual vibe to it, it's all about passion, it's all about success, and it's\n\n3:46:46.760 --> 3:46:51.160\n all about the success of their minds, and nobody else matters.\n\n3:46:51.160 --> 3:46:54.720\n What's really great about that scene, just in terms of constructing the novel, I'm not\n\n3:46:54.720 --> 3:46:59.360\n going to spoil anything, so the Atlas Shrugged has three acts, like three act structures\n\n3:46:59.360 --> 3:47:04.760\n not uncommon, and the first act is about Hank Reardon overcoming all this adversity\n\n3:47:04.760 --> 3:47:10.040\n at home in his personal life and in his business to create this great achievement.\n\n3:47:10.040 --> 3:47:14.980\n So Rand really makes the reader invested in this character and his accomplishments, he's\n\n3:47:14.980 --> 3:47:20.280\n unambiguously doing something good, there's no downside here, he's making it easier to\n\n3:47:20.280 --> 3:47:24.180\n transport people, transport food, this is really just great.\n\n3:47:24.180 --> 3:47:29.080\n And it's just, once you read it and you look back, you're like, she does such a masterful\n\n3:47:29.080 --> 3:47:33.960\n job of making, you have to be a fan of this person and root for them, because she's like,\n\n3:47:33.960 --> 3:47:36.760\n oh, you think things are going great, he's overcome?\n\n3:47:36.760 --> 3:47:37.760\n Hold on a minute.\n\n3:47:37.760 --> 3:47:43.320\n And then the rest of it, she's just real, and your sense of injustice is triggered as\n\n3:47:43.320 --> 3:47:48.560\n a reader to such an nth degree, because you saw what he went through to get to this point,\n\n3:47:48.560 --> 3:47:51.580\n and now you're seeing it taken away from people inferior to him.\n\n3:47:51.580 --> 3:47:56.900\n And one of the quotes on Twitter I use all the time is, I'll see someone, politician\n\n3:47:56.900 --> 3:48:02.640\n or a bureaucrat or a thinker, just advocate for something completely unconscionable.\n\n3:48:02.640 --> 3:48:07.880\n And I'll just quote and say, my favorite criticism of Ayn Rand is that they say her villains\n\n3:48:07.880 --> 3:48:13.080\n are too evil and unrealistic, because the things that people posit with a straight face\n\n3:48:13.080 --> 3:48:16.480\n are so much worse than she has in her book.\n\n3:48:16.480 --> 3:48:18.800\n And not just politicians, you find intellectuals today.\n\n3:48:18.800 --> 3:48:19.800\n Oh, of course.\n\n3:48:19.800 --> 3:48:20.800\n So yeah, yeah.\n\n3:48:20.800 --> 3:48:21.800\n Way, way over the top.\n\n3:48:21.800 --> 3:48:25.400\n You know, even whenever Adlai Shrugged I was going, nobody really talks like this.\n\n3:48:25.400 --> 3:48:26.400\n No, they do.\n\n3:48:26.400 --> 3:48:28.120\n Let me give you one example.\n\n3:48:28.120 --> 3:48:31.960\n There was a story she wrote, which she never published, they published her journals, the\n\n3:48:31.960 --> 3:48:33.560\n Ayn Rand Institute.\n\n3:48:33.560 --> 3:48:36.600\n And there was one character, and this is a prototype of Ellsworth Toohey, he was the\n\n3:48:36.600 --> 3:48:39.520\n villain of one of the villains of the Fountainhead.\n\n3:48:39.520 --> 3:48:43.580\n And basically, the kid had like deformed legs or broke his legs or something like that.\n\n3:48:43.580 --> 3:48:45.620\n And he wants to get leg braces.\n\n3:48:45.620 --> 3:48:47.640\n And the dad is like, Oh, we're not going to do that.\n\n3:48:47.640 --> 3:48:49.160\n Why should you be better than anyone else?\n\n3:48:49.160 --> 3:48:52.320\n Like you should just have like this deformity, accept your fate.\n\n3:48:52.320 --> 3:48:53.320\n And you're reading this.\n\n3:48:53.320 --> 3:48:57.320\n I'm like, what dad is not going to give his kid leg braces, it's ridiculous.\n\n3:48:57.320 --> 3:49:03.560\n But now it's not uncommon for deaf children to not get cochlear implants and not be able\n\n3:49:03.560 --> 3:49:08.500\n to hear because their parents say, well, we're going to lose deaf culture.\n\n3:49:08.500 --> 3:49:09.560\n Hearing is just information.\n\n3:49:09.560 --> 3:49:13.160\n And you're sitting there, and whether you agree with this or not, this is very close\n\n3:49:13.160 --> 3:49:14.880\n to what she was saying.\n\n3:49:14.880 --> 3:49:18.720\n And when I read what she was saying, I'm like, okay, crazy Ayn Rand, this is not a thing.\n\n3:49:18.720 --> 3:49:23.160\n And it's like, oh, yeah, the craziness is that it's not braces, it's hearing.\n\n3:49:23.160 --> 3:49:24.160\n It's yeah.\n\n3:49:24.160 --> 3:49:26.000\n And what evil to deny your kid hearing.\n\n3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:27.720\n I mean, God.\n\n3:49:27.720 --> 3:49:31.680\n So here's the thing, if you want deaf culture, which I would believe is a thing, sign language\n\n3:49:31.680 --> 3:49:33.200\n or whatever, they could turn it off.\n\n3:49:33.200 --> 3:49:34.200\n Yeah.\n\n3:49:34.200 --> 3:49:35.200\n Yeah.\n\n3:49:35.200 --> 3:49:36.200\n If you want, you give them the choice.\n\n3:49:36.200 --> 3:49:37.200\n Yeah.\n\n3:49:37.200 --> 3:49:38.200\n Tonight, I'm sorry, one more thing.\n\n3:49:38.200 --> 3:49:41.640\n You know, Rand used the word evil frequently.\n\n3:49:41.640 --> 3:49:45.240\n And I think maybe I can make the argument she used it too loosely.\n\n3:49:45.240 --> 3:49:49.400\n If you are denying a child the gift of music, I will say that's evil.\n\n3:49:49.400 --> 3:49:51.000\n I agree completely.\n\n3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:52.000\n Unambiguously.\n\n3:49:52.000 --> 3:49:53.000\n Yep.\n\n3:49:53.000 --> 3:49:59.120\n If you go online and listen, watch videos of people getting hearing aids and being able\n\n3:49:59.120 --> 3:50:05.040\n to hear for the first time, I promise you, you will cry because there's no pure, I'm\n\n3:50:05.040 --> 3:50:06.440\n getting teared up right now.\n\n3:50:06.440 --> 3:50:12.560\n There's no pure expression of humanity and technology at its best than seeing a two year\n\n3:50:12.560 --> 3:50:15.440\n old or one and a half year old who can't even talk.\n\n3:50:15.440 --> 3:50:18.040\n And then you see the reaction when they hear mom's voice.\n\n3:50:18.040 --> 3:50:20.160\n It's so beautiful and moving.\n\n3:50:20.160 --> 3:50:21.160\n Absolutely.\n\n3:50:21.160 --> 3:50:22.160\n Yeah.\n\n3:50:22.160 --> 3:50:23.160\n It's just moving.\n\n3:50:23.160 --> 3:50:24.160\n It is.\n\n3:50:24.160 --> 3:50:28.320\n It's like it's one of the, one of the ways to rethink technology, perhaps.\n\n3:50:28.320 --> 3:50:32.440\n And there's this, this is really funny because sometimes it'll be this tough dude, right?\n\n3:50:32.440 --> 3:50:34.000\n And he's been deaf all his life.\n\n3:50:34.000 --> 3:50:36.720\n And then they put the hearing aid and the girl is like, can you hear me?\n\n3:50:36.720 --> 3:50:40.960\n And he's trying to be tough for three seconds and you just sit there.\n\n3:50:40.960 --> 3:50:41.960\n No, absolutely.\n\n3:50:41.960 --> 3:50:43.480\n And that's true of any sense.\n\n3:50:43.480 --> 3:50:44.480\n I mean.\n\n3:50:44.480 --> 3:50:46.960\n Like colorblind people seeing color for the first time, that kind of thing.\n\n3:50:46.960 --> 3:50:48.040\n I think there's a few.\n\n3:50:48.040 --> 3:50:50.800\n It's not quite the same, but it's somewhat.\n\n3:50:50.800 --> 3:50:55.080\n But if you're blind and suddenly can see, I mean, it's just, it's just stunning.\n\n3:50:55.080 --> 3:50:57.160\n I mean, and how do we form our concepts?\n\n3:50:57.160 --> 3:50:58.160\n How do we think?\n\n3:50:58.160 --> 3:51:02.040\n We have to, we get information from reality, right?\n\n3:51:02.040 --> 3:51:06.820\n We interact with reality through our senses and that's how we become conceptual beings.\n\n3:51:06.820 --> 3:51:09.720\n And you deny an element of that from a human being.\n\n3:51:09.720 --> 3:51:10.720\n That is horrible.\n\n3:51:10.720 --> 3:51:14.600\n There's a potential with that, with the Neuralink too, so further developments there.\n\n3:51:14.600 --> 3:51:18.800\n So I mean on that, there's a powerful question of who is John Galt.\n\n3:51:18.800 --> 3:51:21.360\n I don't know if we can do this without spoiler alerts.\n\n3:51:21.360 --> 3:51:22.360\n Yeah, don't spoil the book.\n\n3:51:22.360 --> 3:51:23.360\n Okay.\n\n3:51:23.360 --> 3:51:25.000\n Well, but you can say, you can say.\n\n3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:26.440\n What's the importance of this character?\n\n3:51:26.440 --> 3:51:27.440\n What's the importance of this question?\n\n3:51:27.440 --> 3:51:32.440\n I mean, without the, so I want to give a talk on who is John Galt and who is John Galt in\n\n3:51:32.440 --> 3:51:35.700\n a sense is anybody who takes their own life seriously.\n\n3:51:35.700 --> 3:51:40.440\n Anybody who's willing to really live fully their own life, use their mind in pursuit\n\n3:51:40.440 --> 3:51:47.580\n of their rational values and pursue their happiness fully uncompromisingly with no comp,\n\n3:51:47.580 --> 3:51:53.200\n with no compromise and sticking to the integrity.\n\n3:51:53.200 --> 3:51:55.040\n Anybody can be John Galt in that sense.\n\n3:51:55.040 --> 3:52:02.440\n I think one of the mottos I live by is all we are tasked to, maybe this is a little bit\n\n3:52:02.440 --> 3:52:04.320\n religious but I think your own is going to agree with it.\n\n3:52:04.320 --> 3:52:05.880\n I'm sure you'll agree with it.\n\n3:52:05.880 --> 3:52:09.600\n All any of us can do is leave the world a little bit of a better place than we found\n\n3:52:09.600 --> 3:52:10.600\n it.\n\n3:52:10.600 --> 3:52:15.420\n And I think if you do that through hard work, being honest, being a kind, not at the expense\n\n3:52:15.420 --> 3:52:20.280\n of other people, you can go to your grave patting yourself on the back.\n\n3:52:20.280 --> 3:52:26.960\n I mean, to me, leaving the world a better place, yeah, I mean, that's not what drives\n\n3:52:26.960 --> 3:52:27.960\n me.\n\n3:52:27.960 --> 3:52:29.760\n What drives me is, I mean, what I think drives people.\n\n3:52:29.760 --> 3:52:34.960\n I think just live a good life and good life means a life you're happy living and part\n\n3:52:34.960 --> 3:52:41.640\n of that is the impact you have on the world but it's, so many people live wasted lives,\n\n3:52:41.640 --> 3:52:45.140\n live mediocre lives, live conventional lives.\n\n3:52:45.140 --> 3:52:48.760\n Maybe they even leave the world a better place but they didn't really, they didn't \u2013\n\n3:52:48.760 --> 3:52:50.080\n But they didn't leave the world a better place.\n\n3:52:50.080 --> 3:52:57.800\n They left the world a better place but they didn't live their potential or they died\n\n3:52:57.800 --> 3:53:01.520\n feeling guilty about it or they \u2013 a million different things.\n\n3:53:01.520 --> 3:53:02.720\n So there's so many productive people.\n\n3:53:02.720 --> 3:53:06.680\n I mean, think about all the innovators and the technologists and the businessmen who\n\n3:53:06.680 --> 3:53:10.480\n leave the world a better place by a big shot but are never happy.\n\n3:53:10.480 --> 3:53:14.320\n Never happy in their own souls, in their own life.\n\n3:53:14.320 --> 3:53:17.640\n And to me, that's what counts and if you're going to be happy, you'll leave the better\n\n3:53:17.640 --> 3:53:18.640\n world a better place.\n\n3:53:18.640 --> 3:53:20.220\n And that's what Jean Val symbolizes.\n\n3:53:20.220 --> 3:53:29.120\n To me, it's living your life by your standards, by your values and pursuing that happiness.\n\n3:53:29.120 --> 3:53:33.560\n Well, I take \u2013 I'm sorry, I take in a different context because I think a lot of \u2013 and I\n\n3:53:33.560 --> 3:53:35.000\n don't think you're going to disagree with this.\n\n3:53:35.000 --> 3:53:38.280\n I think a lot of times when you're young, you have unrealistic expectations about what\n\n3:53:38.280 --> 3:53:41.160\n you're going to accomplish and you think to yourself, well, I thought, let's suppose\n\n3:53:41.160 --> 3:53:42.160\n someone wants to go into politics.\n\n3:53:42.160 --> 3:53:44.480\n Well, if I'm not elected president, I'm a failure.\n\n3:53:44.480 --> 3:53:45.480\n That's nonsensical.\n\n3:53:45.480 --> 3:53:48.800\n There's lots of people who are successful who haven't achieved literally the top position\n\n3:53:48.800 --> 3:53:49.800\n in their role.\n\n3:53:49.800 --> 3:53:54.320\n So if you can go to your grave having \u2013 defending everything you've done and you move the needle\n\n3:53:54.320 --> 3:53:55.320\n in the \u2013\n\n3:53:55.320 --> 3:53:56.320\n Yes.\n\n3:53:56.320 --> 3:53:57.320\n Successes should not be relative.\n\n3:53:57.320 --> 3:53:58.320\n Yes.\n\n3:53:58.320 --> 3:53:59.320\n So that goes back to second handedness.\n\n3:53:59.320 --> 3:54:00.320\n Yes.\n\n3:54:00.320 --> 3:54:01.320\n Success is not being better than other people.\n\n3:54:01.320 --> 3:54:03.360\n Success is not being the best.\n\n3:54:03.360 --> 3:54:06.480\n Success is maximizing your potential, whatever that is.\n\n3:54:06.480 --> 3:54:13.960\n And look, I know people \u2013 I have a son who could be a really good engineer, a really\n\n3:54:13.960 --> 3:54:18.880\n good mathematician, really good scientist, but he decided he wants to write comedy.\n\n3:54:18.880 --> 3:54:23.160\n So he might have been a better mathematician than he is a comedian, but that's his values.\n\n3:54:23.160 --> 3:54:24.160\n That's his goals.\n\n3:54:24.160 --> 3:54:25.760\n That's what he wants to do.\n\n3:54:25.760 --> 3:54:29.080\n And hopefully he'll be really, really good at that and he'll be incredibly successful\n\n3:54:29.080 --> 3:54:34.600\n at it materially in every other sense, but that's what you pursue.\n\n3:54:34.600 --> 3:54:39.640\n So it's really being true to yourself in a deep sense.\n\n3:54:39.640 --> 3:54:43.200\n And if you are true to yourself, yeah, you'll leave the world a better place, but that's\n\n3:54:43.200 --> 3:54:44.200\n not the essence.\n\n3:54:44.200 --> 3:54:45.680\n The essence is you.\n\n3:54:45.680 --> 3:54:47.340\n No, focus on you.\n\n3:54:47.340 --> 3:54:50.160\n Focus on making your life the best life that it can be.\n\n3:54:50.160 --> 3:54:54.760\n And if you do that, you'll make the world a better place by \u2013 almost by definition.\n\n3:54:54.760 --> 3:54:55.760\n Yeah.\n\n3:54:55.760 --> 3:54:56.760\n You'll impact people.\n\n3:54:56.760 --> 3:54:58.960\n We're looking at the same thing in different ways.\n\n3:54:58.960 --> 3:54:59.960\n Yeah.\n\n3:54:59.960 --> 3:55:06.760\n So at least in my little corner of the world, it was disappointing how rare that is.\n\n3:55:06.760 --> 3:55:12.920\n So one of the reasons I'm here in Austin and one of the reasons my work gravitated\n\n3:55:12.920 --> 3:55:21.120\n towards Elon Musk is because he represents that person for me in the world of technology,\n\n3:55:21.120 --> 3:55:23.760\n in the world of CEO, in the world of business.\n\n3:55:23.760 --> 3:55:29.360\n It was very surprising to me the more I've learned about the world of tech, how few people\n\n3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:35.480\n live unapologetically, fully to their potential.\n\n3:55:35.480 --> 3:55:38.120\n I'm sure people, others do that.\n\n3:55:38.120 --> 3:55:39.120\n Maybe music and art.\n\n3:55:39.120 --> 3:55:40.120\n I'm not sure.\n\n3:55:40.120 --> 3:55:41.120\n I don't know about those worlds.\n\n3:55:41.120 --> 3:55:43.320\n I do know about the technology world.\n\n3:55:43.320 --> 3:55:49.400\n And it was disappointing to me how many people compromise their integrity in subtle ways\n\n3:55:49.400 --> 3:55:52.080\n at first, but then it becomes a slippery slope and then you \u2013\n\n3:55:52.080 --> 3:55:53.200\n Can I say this?\n\n3:55:53.200 --> 3:55:57.400\n There's this great quote and I always forget if it's Steinbeck or Hemingway and the quote\n\n3:55:57.400 --> 3:56:01.760\n \u2013 and this applies for money, it applies for morality \u2013 the quote was, how did you\n\n3:56:01.760 --> 3:56:03.280\n go bankrupt?\n\n3:56:03.280 --> 3:56:06.500\n And he says two ways, gradually and then suddenly.\n\n3:56:06.500 --> 3:56:10.160\n It's very hard to one day be like, I have no integrity.\n\n3:56:10.160 --> 3:56:11.240\n That doesn't happen.\n\n3:56:11.240 --> 3:56:15.720\n It's very easy if it's like, look, I stole this candy bar.\n\n3:56:15.720 --> 3:56:17.920\n What's the big deal if I steal this thing?\n\n3:56:17.920 --> 3:56:18.920\n Then you're still \u2013\n\n3:56:18.920 --> 3:56:20.640\n People say there are no slippery slopes.\n\n3:56:20.640 --> 3:56:24.040\n There are and they're big and they're very slippery and people slide.\n\n3:56:24.040 --> 3:56:25.360\n This is the biggest one.\n\n3:56:25.360 --> 3:56:27.820\n And people violate their integrity even without stealing.\n\n3:56:27.820 --> 3:56:31.700\n Just little things about how they treat other people, how they treat themselves, the values\n\n3:56:31.700 --> 3:56:32.700\n they pursue.\n\n3:56:32.700 --> 3:56:34.660\n They don't go after the profession they really wanted to.\n\n3:56:34.660 --> 3:56:39.200\n They compromise in ways that they shouldn't with their spouse or with their mothers or\n\n3:56:39.200 --> 3:56:40.200\n whatever.\n\n3:56:40.200 --> 3:56:42.680\n And then they wake up one day when they're 40.\n\n3:56:42.680 --> 3:56:47.480\n And this is why people go through a midlife crisis.\n\n3:56:47.480 --> 3:56:51.200\n Midlife crisis is a crisis where you suddenly realize, I didn't do it.\n\n3:56:51.200 --> 3:56:52.800\n I didn't live up to my standards.\n\n3:56:52.800 --> 3:56:55.920\n I didn't live up to my youthful idealism.\n\n3:56:55.920 --> 3:56:57.840\n I compromised and I sold out.\n\n3:56:57.840 --> 3:57:00.120\n But I also would warn you about Silicon Valley.\n\n3:57:00.120 --> 3:57:06.960\n Yeah, I think at the top very few of them stick to it and partially it's the political\n\n3:57:06.960 --> 3:57:07.960\n pressure is unbearable.\n\n3:57:07.960 --> 3:57:09.800\n I mean, how would you?\n\n3:57:09.800 --> 3:57:10.800\n How can you?\n\n3:57:10.800 --> 3:57:13.700\n It would require to be a hero and very few of them are.\n\n3:57:13.700 --> 3:57:18.120\n But there are a lot of people who do really well at all kinds of levels in technology\n\n3:57:18.120 --> 3:57:20.160\n who \u2013 little startups, people.\n\n3:57:20.160 --> 3:57:21.160\n And this is the point Michael was making.\n\n3:57:21.160 --> 3:57:22.160\n You don't have to be the best.\n\n3:57:22.160 --> 3:57:23.160\n Yeah.\n\n3:57:23.160 --> 3:57:28.600\n You know, you don't have to be a CEO to live to your max and to live with integrity\n\n3:57:28.600 --> 3:57:30.720\n and to live a great life.\n\n3:57:30.720 --> 3:57:36.560\n I know people who because they joined Amazon or whatever have just made a life for themselves,\n\n3:57:36.560 --> 3:57:41.640\n an amazing life for themselves and have done great work at Amazon let's say and then\n\n3:57:41.640 --> 3:57:45.700\n have lived a great life because of the opportunity that created for them.\n\n3:57:45.700 --> 3:57:51.520\n So I think there are more good people out there but yes, one of the saddest things of\n\n3:57:51.520 --> 3:57:57.960\n growing up is \u2013 or even when you're a teenager and looking at adults and noticing\n\n3:57:57.960 --> 3:58:04.400\n how few of them actually live, I mean really alive in a sense of living their values and\n\n3:58:04.400 --> 3:58:05.400\n enjoying their life.\n\n3:58:05.400 --> 3:58:10.200\n And you start with your parents and you look across the people, everybody lives such mediocre\n\n3:58:10.200 --> 3:58:11.200\n lives.\n\n3:58:11.200 --> 3:58:12.200\n Yeah.\n\n3:58:12.200 --> 3:58:13.200\n And the other thing is they don't have to.\n\n3:58:13.200 --> 3:58:14.200\n That's what people don't appreciate.\n\n3:58:14.200 --> 3:58:15.200\n They don't have to.\n\n3:58:15.200 --> 3:58:18.720\n Particularly not in the world that we live in today that's so wealthy and so many \u2013 we\n\n3:58:18.720 --> 3:58:20.440\n all have so many opportunities.\n\n3:58:20.440 --> 3:58:27.760\n So what \u2013 by way of advice, what advice would you give to young people to live their\n\n3:58:27.760 --> 3:58:28.760\n life fully?\n\n3:58:28.760 --> 3:58:35.480\n I mean Michael and I have talked about this but it bears repeating.\n\n3:58:35.480 --> 3:58:40.040\n So if you look at John Galt, if you look at the highest ideals of what we \u2013 of a life\n\n3:58:40.040 --> 3:58:43.960\n we could live, what advice would you give to a 20 year old today, 18 year old?\n\n3:58:43.960 --> 3:58:46.840\n Can I say \u2013 I don't think \u2013 and I think Rand would agree.\n\n3:58:46.840 --> 3:58:51.720\n When Rand was writing John Galt, she says, when you have this character's human perfection,\n\n3:58:51.720 --> 3:58:53.400\n you don't want to get too close.\n\n3:58:53.400 --> 3:58:56.920\n So he's a little bit of a vague character because she was aware that when you're dealing\n\n3:58:56.920 --> 3:58:59.480\n with day to day, it kind of \u2013 the shine comes off.\n\n3:58:59.480 --> 3:59:03.200\n I think Rourke is a lot better character for a young person.\n\n3:59:03.200 --> 3:59:04.200\n Oh really?\n\n3:59:04.200 --> 3:59:07.300\n Yeah, but Rourke is all \u2013 the entirety of the Fountainhead is Rourke.\n\n3:59:07.300 --> 3:59:08.440\n So Ed Reardon is the one of several.\n\n3:59:08.440 --> 3:59:09.440\n We barely know John Galt.\n\n3:59:09.440 --> 3:59:10.440\n Yeah.\n\n3:59:10.440 --> 3:59:12.980\n So but Rourke is someone where you could be like, okay.\n\n3:59:12.980 --> 3:59:15.600\n And what Rourke also gives young people is \u2013\n\n3:59:15.600 --> 3:59:16.600\n That's in the Fountainhead.\n\n3:59:16.600 --> 3:59:20.160\n That's in the Fountainhead, is the strength to persevere.\n\n3:59:20.160 --> 3:59:23.520\n Because when you're young, you're going to have down times.\n\n3:59:23.520 --> 3:59:25.720\n There's going to be times when you're lonely.\n\n3:59:25.720 --> 3:59:28.160\n There's going to be times when you don't have a girlfriend.\n\n3:59:28.160 --> 3:59:32.080\n There's going to be times when you're out of work and you're thinking, holy crap, I'm\n\n3:59:32.080 --> 3:59:33.480\n falling between the cracks.\n\n3:59:33.480 --> 3:59:34.600\n I'm going to accomplish that.\n\n3:59:34.600 --> 3:59:36.040\n I'm going to be a failure.\n\n3:59:36.040 --> 3:59:38.960\n And he gives them the courage.\n\n3:59:38.960 --> 3:59:42.120\n There's even a scene in the Fountainhead, which is this amazing scene.\n\n3:59:42.120 --> 3:59:45.800\n I love that it's not talked about enough where basically Rourke is looking at one of\n\n3:59:45.800 --> 3:59:50.800\n his buildings and this little kid on a bicycle comes up to him and \u2013 Yaron, please correct\n\n3:59:50.800 --> 3:59:51.800\n me.\n\n3:59:51.800 --> 3:59:52.800\n And he's like, who built this?\n\n3:59:52.800 --> 3:59:54.720\n And Rourke said, I did.\n\n3:59:54.720 --> 3:59:58.240\n And the line is, you know, Rourke didn't realize it, but he just gave that kid the\n\n3:59:58.240 --> 4:00:00.080\n courage to face the lifetime.\n\n4:00:00.080 --> 4:00:06.360\n And I think that is such a beautiful thing where you can find inspiration in this character.\n\n4:00:06.360 --> 4:00:08.440\n Don't become needlessly difficult.\n\n4:00:08.440 --> 4:00:10.020\n Don't start parroting his lines.\n\n4:00:10.020 --> 4:00:12.920\n You're not Howard Rourke and he's not a real person.\n\n4:00:12.920 --> 4:00:16.580\n But there's aspects of him that you can apply to your life.\n\n4:00:16.580 --> 4:00:17.580\n And here's something else.\n\n4:00:17.580 --> 4:00:20.080\n I'll give you one example because this happened to me.\n\n4:00:20.080 --> 4:00:23.800\n When I was working at Goldman Sachs, I was doing tech support and my great grandmother\n\n4:00:23.800 --> 4:00:25.400\n had passed away that year.\n\n4:00:25.400 --> 4:00:28.800\n And I promised my grandmother I would have \u2013 I've told this story several times.\n\n4:00:28.800 --> 4:00:30.960\n I would have Thanksgiving dinner with her.\n\n4:00:30.960 --> 4:00:35.740\n I was working second shift, fort to midnight, and we were a 24 seven help desk.\n\n4:00:35.740 --> 4:00:39.640\n And I got the schedule for the next week and I sold my grandmother to have lunch with\n\n4:00:39.640 --> 4:00:40.900\n her at Thanksgiving.\n\n4:00:40.900 --> 4:00:44.680\n And they had put me down from fort to midnight the day before Wednesday, which is my normal\n\n4:00:44.680 --> 4:00:47.160\n shift, but then the day shift the next day.\n\n4:00:47.160 --> 4:00:50.840\n And I go to my boss, I go \u2013 first off, second shift, I'm like, this Thanksgiving, I promised\n\n4:00:50.840 --> 4:00:51.920\n my grandma.\n\n4:00:51.920 --> 4:00:54.560\n And they're like, well, if you could find someone to fill this, we'll do it.\n\n4:00:54.560 --> 4:00:55.560\n And I asked everyone.\n\n4:00:55.560 --> 4:00:56.560\n They're like, no.\n\n4:00:56.560 --> 4:00:58.580\n And I said, I'm not coming in.\n\n4:00:58.580 --> 4:01:03.440\n And I 100%, not even a question, if I asked my grandmother, can we have dinner instead,\n\n4:01:03.440 --> 4:01:04.680\n she would have said yes.\n\n4:01:04.680 --> 4:01:08.320\n But this was one of those moments, maybe this is from my huge ego where I felt like I was\n\n4:01:08.320 --> 4:01:10.280\n in a movie and I'm making a choice.\n\n4:01:10.280 --> 4:01:12.880\n Am I going to ask grandma?\n\n4:01:12.880 --> 4:01:15.100\n Or am I going to just bend the knee?\n\n4:01:15.100 --> 4:01:19.280\n And I go, I go, I couldn't find anyone and I go, I'm not coming in.\n\n4:01:19.280 --> 4:01:21.600\n And they go, if you're not coming in, you're fired.\n\n4:01:21.600 --> 4:01:23.160\n And I go, fire me.\n\n4:01:23.160 --> 4:01:24.880\n And they did fire me.\n\n4:01:24.880 --> 4:01:27.080\n And I have no regrets.\n\n4:01:27.080 --> 4:01:31.120\n And because if I compromised, I'd have money in my pocket.\n\n4:01:31.120 --> 4:01:34.080\n But since I didn't compromise, I could look at that story.\n\n4:01:34.080 --> 4:01:36.840\n Rand talks about how man is a being of self made soul.\n\n4:01:36.840 --> 4:01:42.280\n I could look at that story, and next time, I have a time where it's a tough decision,\n\n4:01:42.280 --> 4:01:45.920\n where there's really pressure, I could be like, you know what, this is the kind of person\n\n4:01:45.920 --> 4:01:47.140\n you are.\n\n4:01:47.140 --> 4:01:48.140\n Stick to it.\n\n4:01:48.140 --> 4:01:49.140\n I'll give one more example.\n\n4:01:49.140 --> 4:01:50.140\n Sorry, you're on.\n\n4:01:50.140 --> 4:01:51.760\n I've given talks on networking.\n\n4:01:51.760 --> 4:01:55.620\n And I tell people, I like to use humor, because humor is a great way to shortcut the brain\n\n4:01:55.620 --> 4:01:57.160\n and get the truth to them directly.\n\n4:01:57.160 --> 4:02:04.240\n I say, if you know someone is in town, it's their birthday, and they're not doing anything,\n\n4:02:04.240 --> 4:02:05.240\n take them out.\n\n4:02:05.240 --> 4:02:06.360\n And I say, I do this for Rand reasons.\n\n4:02:06.360 --> 4:02:07.360\n I do it selfishly.\n\n4:02:07.360 --> 4:02:08.720\n And the audience laughs.\n\n4:02:08.720 --> 4:02:09.720\n And I go, you're laughing.\n\n4:02:09.720 --> 4:02:14.840\n But I go, the guy who takes people out for their birthday is awesome.\n\n4:02:14.840 --> 4:02:15.840\n That could be you.\n\n4:02:15.840 --> 4:02:16.840\n There's nothing stopping you.\n\n4:02:16.840 --> 4:02:20.280\n You're just not thinking in these terms, what's it going to cost you $30?\n\n4:02:20.280 --> 4:02:24.360\n But for the rest of their life, or a few years, that person will remember you and be like,\n\n4:02:24.360 --> 4:02:27.160\n you know what, this person did right by me.\n\n4:02:27.160 --> 4:02:31.400\n And I'll give you a concrete example, which changed my life profoundly.\n\n4:02:31.400 --> 4:02:35.960\n Ted Hope, who was the producer of the film American Splendor, which starred my mentor\n\n4:02:35.960 --> 4:02:42.200\n Harvey Pekar, sent an email to his firm that said Harvey's in town with nothing to do.\n\n4:02:42.200 --> 4:02:44.400\n If you want to hang out with him, here's your chance.\n\n4:02:44.400 --> 4:02:46.080\n They worked at a film company.\n\n4:02:46.080 --> 4:02:51.000\n And I was the only one, I got the email, I wasn't working there from a friend who took\n\n4:02:51.000 --> 4:02:52.200\n him up on it.\n\n4:02:52.200 --> 4:02:55.520\n And as a consequence, Harvey wrote a graphic novel about me, Ego and Hubris, which is $250\n\n4:02:55.520 --> 4:02:58.400\n on eBay now, and it moves at that, not too shabby.\n\n4:02:58.400 --> 4:03:03.620\n The point being, you know what, someone had a movie made about him.\n\n4:03:03.620 --> 4:03:05.000\n Someone is an interesting figure.\n\n4:03:05.000 --> 4:03:07.960\n Take the lunch and stay overtime for an hour.\n\n4:03:07.960 --> 4:03:11.160\n But so many people don't think in those terms.\n\n4:03:11.160 --> 4:03:12.960\n And there's so many opportunities for them.\n\n4:03:12.960 --> 4:03:14.480\n And so that's the advice I give.\n\n4:03:14.480 --> 4:03:17.560\n And I think it's also good to give advice via anecdote.\n\n4:03:17.560 --> 4:03:21.880\n So not only is the person getting the advice, they are learning why you got to that point.\n\n4:03:21.880 --> 4:03:24.240\n And maybe I'm wrong, but at least they've thought about it.\n\n4:03:24.240 --> 4:03:26.200\n Yeah, I mean, I agree with all of that.\n\n4:03:26.200 --> 4:03:31.160\n And I like the line, Ayn Rand's line about man is a self made soul, is a creature of\n\n4:03:31.160 --> 4:03:33.680\n self made soul is huge.\n\n4:03:33.680 --> 4:03:37.880\n And it's something most people don't realize, and it's something that modern intellectuals\n\n4:03:37.880 --> 4:03:38.880\n undermine.\n\n4:03:38.880 --> 4:03:43.240\n I mean, even somebody like Sam Harris, when you keep telling people they don't have free\n\n4:03:43.240 --> 4:03:46.000\n will, then you don't have a self made soul.\n\n4:03:46.000 --> 4:03:49.840\n Because what is self made, there is no self, according to Sam, right?\n\n4:03:49.840 --> 4:03:52.760\n He meditates and he sees that he doesn't have a self.\n\n4:03:52.760 --> 4:03:59.200\n So you're undermining the ability of people to take control of their own lives and make\n\n4:03:59.200 --> 4:04:03.880\n the kind of choices that are necessary to create the kind of moral character that is\n\n4:04:03.880 --> 4:04:05.600\n necessary for them to be successful.\n\n4:04:05.600 --> 4:04:12.280\n So I'd encourage people to go read Foundhead and Atlas Shrugged because put aside the politics,\n\n4:04:12.280 --> 4:04:19.760\n put aside even aspects of the philosophy, focus on these models.\n\n4:04:19.760 --> 4:04:22.560\n How to Walk is a great model for all of us.\n\n4:04:22.560 --> 4:04:28.140\n It's a great story to have in your head, in your mind when you encounter challenging choices\n\n4:04:28.140 --> 4:04:30.520\n that you might make.\n\n4:04:30.520 --> 4:04:35.520\n And then spend the time, and this is, I don't think I ever did this when I was young, I\n\n4:04:35.520 --> 4:04:39.120\n don't think people do this, but spend the time thinking about what your values really\n\n4:04:39.120 --> 4:04:40.120\n are.\n\n4:04:40.120 --> 4:04:42.460\n What do you love doing?\n\n4:04:42.460 --> 4:04:44.980\n What makes, what gets you going?\n\n4:04:44.980 --> 4:04:46.720\n What gets you excited?\n\n4:04:46.720 --> 4:04:50.060\n And how can I make a living at this?\n\n4:04:50.060 --> 4:04:53.560\n How can I do this and live through this?\n\n4:04:53.560 --> 4:04:58.120\n And then, you know, think about what kind of life you want, what kind of, I don't know,\n\n4:04:58.120 --> 4:04:59.680\n what kind of people you want to hang out with.\n\n4:04:59.680 --> 4:05:03.720\n Don't just, don't let life just happen to you.\n\n4:05:03.720 --> 4:05:04.720\n Think it through.\n\n4:05:04.720 --> 4:05:07.840\n What kind of people, for example, if you want ambitious, excited, maybe you should move\n\n4:05:07.840 --> 4:05:11.160\n to Silicon Valley, to Austin, Texas, right?\n\n4:05:11.160 --> 4:05:14.680\n If you want to be around artsy people, I mean, you should go to Hollywood, maybe you should\n\n4:05:14.680 --> 4:05:20.120\n go to New York, you know, I don't know, but figure out what kind of life you want to live,\n\n4:05:20.120 --> 4:05:23.200\n what kind of people you want to hang out with, what kind of woman you want to spend your\n\n4:05:23.200 --> 4:05:28.640\n life with, what kind of romantic relationship you want to have, figure that out and go and\n\n4:05:28.640 --> 4:05:29.640\n do it.\n\n4:05:29.640 --> 4:05:30.640\n Don't sit around.\n\n4:05:30.640 --> 4:05:31.640\n Life is not...\n\n4:05:31.640 --> 4:05:32.640\n Or try and fail.\n\n4:05:32.640 --> 4:05:33.640\n It's okay.\n\n4:05:33.640 --> 4:05:34.640\n You're going to fail.\n\n4:05:34.640 --> 4:05:35.640\n Oh, failure, failure, absolutely.\n\n4:05:35.640 --> 4:05:36.640\n Don't fail.\n\n4:05:36.640 --> 4:05:37.640\n Yeah.\n\n4:05:37.640 --> 4:05:38.640\n And learn from that failure.\n\n4:05:38.640 --> 4:05:39.640\n And that's another thing.\n\n4:05:39.640 --> 4:05:41.800\n Think about what you're doing, why you're succeeding, why you're failing, and keep improving.\n\n4:05:41.800 --> 4:05:44.160\n Keep working on it because it's not just going to happen like this.\n\n4:05:44.160 --> 4:05:48.560\n Nobody is Francisco to take a character out of Atlas Shark, to succeed at everything,\n\n4:05:48.560 --> 4:05:50.380\n first try, right?\n\n4:05:50.380 --> 4:05:51.720\n We all need to fail a few times.\n\n4:05:51.720 --> 4:05:56.200\n We all need to, but what have you got to lose?\n\n4:05:56.200 --> 4:05:58.760\n Every second is never going to be back.\n\n4:05:58.760 --> 4:06:02.440\n I mean, these are all cliches, but they're all true cliches.\n\n4:06:02.440 --> 4:06:11.420\n So think, figure out what your values are, and try to apply your reason, your rational\n\n4:06:11.420 --> 4:06:14.360\n thought on getting those values.\n\n4:06:14.360 --> 4:06:18.760\n We talked about early on in the show, in the interview, we talked about integrating your\n\n4:06:18.760 --> 4:06:21.200\n emotions with your cognition.\n\n4:06:21.200 --> 4:06:24.880\n I think that's crucial because you don't want to be fighting your emotions as you move towards\n\n4:06:24.880 --> 4:06:25.880\n these things.\n\n4:06:25.880 --> 4:06:28.400\n You don't want your emotions to be barriers to your own success.\n\n4:06:28.400 --> 4:06:35.280\n You want them to be cheerleaders, to chew on when good things happen and to be negative\n\n4:06:35.280 --> 4:06:38.320\n emotions when it's justified that they're negative.\n\n4:06:38.320 --> 4:06:41.000\n So work on integrating your soul.\n\n4:06:41.000 --> 4:06:44.180\n So creating your own soul, that's the real challenge.\n\n4:06:44.180 --> 4:06:46.420\n And I'll give one piece of meta advice.\n\n4:06:46.420 --> 4:06:49.520\n When you're young, you're going to be clueless because you're going to be ignorant, you know\n\n4:06:49.520 --> 4:06:50.700\n the data.\n\n4:06:50.700 --> 4:06:56.360\n Don't ask your dopey friends for advice because they want to be helpful, but the friends want\n\n4:06:56.360 --> 4:06:57.360\n to be helpful.\n\n4:06:57.360 --> 4:06:58.360\n They're as dopey as you.\n\n4:06:58.360 --> 4:06:59.640\n They have uninformed as you.\n\n4:06:59.640 --> 4:07:02.560\n So they're just going to give you platitudes and you're going to be worse off because now\n\n4:07:02.560 --> 4:07:06.180\n you're going to be confused, especially with social media.\n\n4:07:06.180 --> 4:07:09.320\n Reach out to people who are older than you, who are accomplished.\n\n4:07:09.320 --> 4:07:13.040\n You'd be surprised how often that you got to send them 20 bucks, buy them dinner, buy\n\n4:07:13.040 --> 4:07:15.320\n their book, whatever it takes.\n\n4:07:15.320 --> 4:07:22.360\n You are getting free world class advice for very cheap and that is really a mechanism\n\n4:07:22.360 --> 4:07:23.360\n for success.\n\n4:07:23.360 --> 4:07:25.760\n And here's something very unpopular and not sexy.\n\n4:07:25.760 --> 4:07:28.320\n This is why people probably unfollow me.\n\n4:07:28.320 --> 4:07:29.320\n That's not why.\n\n4:07:29.320 --> 4:07:30.320\n Read.\n\n4:07:30.320 --> 4:07:32.040\n Well, you'll tell me why after this.\n\n4:07:32.040 --> 4:07:33.440\n Read, read, read.\n\n4:07:33.440 --> 4:07:36.760\n Because you're not always going to have access to those experts.\n\n4:07:36.760 --> 4:07:39.280\n And I'm not just talking about self help books.\n\n4:07:39.280 --> 4:07:41.240\n I'm not even talking about self help books.\n\n4:07:41.240 --> 4:07:42.520\n Read the words with literature.\n\n4:07:42.520 --> 4:07:47.280\n I mean, literature presents you with all the different characters.\n\n4:07:47.280 --> 4:07:50.960\n You know, read Dostoevsky, right?\n\n4:07:50.960 --> 4:07:52.760\n Read Hugo, right?\n\n4:07:52.760 --> 4:07:56.840\n Read all these authors that have taken time to really create characters and put them in\n\n4:07:56.840 --> 4:08:01.280\n situations that maybe you will never face those exact situations, but you'll face similar\n\n4:08:01.280 --> 4:08:04.580\n situations and they play it out for you.\n\n4:08:04.580 --> 4:08:06.920\n You'll see what the consequences are.\n\n4:08:06.920 --> 4:08:10.500\n Great literature is a real tool for building your soul.\n\n4:08:10.500 --> 4:08:14.840\n Read generally with literature and particularly because it's more conceptual.\n\n4:08:14.840 --> 4:08:20.720\n What maybe you could speak to love and relationship in your own life, but in general, if we look\n\n4:08:20.720 --> 4:08:26.360\n at Alice Shrugged, if we look at Fountainhead, and maybe this is going to become a therapy\n\n4:08:26.360 --> 4:08:32.680\n session for Lex, but also just looking at your own life in a form of advice, how can\n\n4:08:32.680 --> 4:08:41.160\n you be a heroic Reardon type character and live your life to the fullest in creating\n\n4:08:41.160 --> 4:08:48.040\n the most amazing things that you're able to create and yet have others in your life that\n\n4:08:48.040 --> 4:08:54.000\n you give yourself to in terms of loving them fully and having a family, having kids, but\n\n4:08:54.000 --> 4:08:57.840\n just even just the love of your life kind of thing.\n\n4:08:57.840 --> 4:09:00.240\n How do you balance those things together?\n\n4:09:00.240 --> 4:09:02.320\n Is there any anything to say?\n\n4:09:02.320 --> 4:09:05.000\n I'll say one thing because then I'll defer to you, Ron, because he's the one who's married\n\n4:09:05.000 --> 4:09:06.000\n here.\n\n4:09:06.000 --> 4:09:07.080\n I don't think it's a balance.\n\n4:09:07.080 --> 4:09:09.560\n I think they compliment each other and feed off each other.\n\n4:09:09.560 --> 4:09:12.240\n So it's like, how do you balance having shoes and pants?\n\n4:09:12.240 --> 4:09:14.040\n It's like, no, you want both.\n\n4:09:14.040 --> 4:09:15.040\n You want it all.\n\n4:09:15.040 --> 4:09:19.560\n And having a great partner who thinks you're a badass and then sometimes they're on the\n\n4:09:19.560 --> 4:09:22.320\n stage and you're like, oh my, I'm married to a badass.\n\n4:09:22.320 --> 4:09:23.320\n That's the goal.\n\n4:09:23.320 --> 4:09:24.320\n Am I wrong?\n\n4:09:24.320 --> 4:09:25.320\n No, absolutely.\n\n4:09:25.320 --> 4:09:26.320\n It feeds off of each other.\n\n4:09:26.320 --> 4:09:27.320\n It's synergetic.\n\n4:09:27.320 --> 4:09:28.320\n It's completely synergetic.\n\n4:09:28.320 --> 4:09:33.160\n The problem that people have, I think, where they get into challenges is when they view\n\n4:09:33.160 --> 4:09:35.080\n them as opposites, right?\n\n4:09:35.080 --> 4:09:36.080\n Work or family.\n\n4:09:36.080 --> 4:09:42.800\n Well, if you don't work the family, you can't finance the family, but more than that.\n\n4:09:42.800 --> 4:09:45.720\n Why is your wife going to love you?\n\n4:09:45.720 --> 4:09:47.360\n What are the virtues that you're bringing?\n\n4:09:47.360 --> 4:09:51.080\n If you don't maximize your own potential, if you don't live the best life that you can\n\n4:09:51.080 --> 4:09:52.840\n live, what is it to love?\n\n4:09:52.840 --> 4:09:56.640\n And if she doesn't do the same thing, why do you love her?\n\n4:09:56.640 --> 4:10:02.080\n So you don't get this conflict between work and, you know, how do I have a balanced life?\n\n4:10:02.080 --> 4:10:03.560\n Of course you have a balanced life.\n\n4:10:03.560 --> 4:10:07.200\n You balance it based on your values and it's never going to be the same.\n\n4:10:07.200 --> 4:10:12.320\n The balance is, you know, the time you spend at work and with family when you're young\n\n4:10:12.320 --> 4:10:15.880\n or when you have little kids or when they're grown up is all going to be different.\n\n4:10:15.880 --> 4:10:19.280\n It's going to depend on your priorities at the point, but it's all going to feed off\n\n4:10:19.280 --> 4:10:20.280\n of each other.\n\n4:10:20.280 --> 4:10:23.160\n So maybe another word outside of balance is sacrifice.\n\n4:10:23.160 --> 4:10:25.560\n Do you think relationship involves sacrifice or no?\n\n4:10:25.560 --> 4:10:26.560\n Does he know what he's doing?\n\n4:10:26.560 --> 4:10:27.560\n I know.\n\n4:10:27.560 --> 4:10:28.560\n He's trolling you.\n\n4:10:28.560 --> 4:10:29.560\n Is he trolling me?\n\n4:10:29.560 --> 4:10:30.560\n He's a big troll.\n\n4:10:30.560 --> 4:10:31.560\n Is he trolling me?\n\n4:10:31.560 --> 4:10:32.560\n Never.\n\n4:10:32.560 --> 4:10:33.560\n Lex is the biggest troll on Twitter.\n\n4:10:33.560 --> 4:10:34.560\n Ever.\n\n4:10:34.560 --> 4:10:35.560\n Ever.\n\n4:10:35.560 --> 4:10:36.560\n Ever.\n\n4:10:36.560 --> 4:10:37.560\n Ever sacrifice.\n\n4:10:37.560 --> 4:10:38.560\n Deal with it.\n\n4:10:38.560 --> 4:10:39.560\n Never sacrifice.\n\n4:10:39.560 --> 4:10:40.560\n Never sacrifice.\n\n4:10:40.560 --> 4:10:41.560\n But see, he means sacrifice in the context.\n\n4:10:41.560 --> 4:10:42.560\n I know.\n\n4:10:42.560 --> 4:10:43.560\n I know.\n\n4:10:43.560 --> 4:10:44.560\n So I'm going to define it.\n\n4:10:44.560 --> 4:10:45.560\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n4:10:45.560 --> 4:10:46.560\n Okay.\n\n4:10:46.560 --> 4:10:47.560\n Sacrifice in my world.\n\n4:10:47.560 --> 4:10:48.560\n Can I say one thing before we get sidebar?\n\n4:10:48.560 --> 4:10:49.560\n Rand had a good example when he was talking about balance.\n\n4:10:49.560 --> 4:10:50.560\n So she was married to this guy, Frank O. Connor.\n\n4:10:50.560 --> 4:10:51.560\n He was not a cerebral.\n\n4:10:51.560 --> 4:10:52.560\n He was not intellectual.\n\n4:10:52.560 --> 4:10:53.560\n That's fine.\n\n4:10:53.560 --> 4:10:54.560\n She was in love with him.\n\n4:10:54.560 --> 4:10:55.560\n She was a fan.\n\n4:10:55.560 --> 4:10:58.040\n And a lot of times she'd have these conversations with her acolytes till like four in the morning\n\n4:10:58.040 --> 4:10:59.880\n about the most cerebral topics.\n\n4:10:59.880 --> 4:11:01.560\n And I said, he would always bring them food.\n\n4:11:01.560 --> 4:11:06.480\n He'd stay up and kind of sit there in a corner and I go, when this was happening, was he\n\n4:11:06.480 --> 4:11:09.800\n sitting there like, oh God, here goes crazy old Ein and I just got to be bored?\n\n4:11:09.800 --> 4:11:12.040\n And they go, absolutely not.\n\n4:11:12.040 --> 4:11:14.120\n He was so proud of her.\n\n4:11:14.120 --> 4:11:15.700\n He was so excited.\n\n4:11:15.700 --> 4:11:19.980\n In fact, when she got a lot of money from, I think selling Red Pawn, which was her screenplay,\n\n4:11:19.980 --> 4:11:24.320\n which never produced, he told her you can buy any kind of fur coat as long as it's\n\n4:11:24.320 --> 4:11:29.040\n Mink, he's like, you earn this, celebrate it, so that was a good example.\n\n4:11:29.040 --> 4:11:35.120\n And that's a good relationship, absolutely. Now, sacrifice is the giving of a value and\n\n4:11:35.120 --> 4:11:40.640\n expecting either nothing or something less in return. You don't do that in a love relationship.\n\n4:11:41.440 --> 4:11:46.960\n Your love relationship is a sense, a trait. You're constantly trading. You're not trading\n\n4:11:46.960 --> 4:11:53.280\n materially, but you're trading spiritually. Imagine if I only gave my wife, if I gave\n\n4:11:53.280 --> 4:11:58.240\n spiritually and materially, only in one direction. I'd get sick of it. She'd get sick of it. It\n\n4:11:58.240 --> 4:12:04.720\n would never last. It has to be in give and take constantly, in different ways, different values.\n\n4:12:04.720 --> 4:12:10.400\n It's not a monetary exchange, but it's constantly you're giving and you're receiving and you're\n\n4:12:10.400 --> 4:12:16.480\n giving. And that's got to be in balance. And I know a lot of relationships where that gets out\n\n4:12:16.480 --> 4:12:22.000\n of balance. And one party feels like they're giving all the time, they're sacrificing.\n\n4:12:22.000 --> 4:12:24.960\n They're giving more than they're receiving, in a sense. And it's over.\n\n4:12:27.200 --> 4:12:32.880\n Now, people use the word sacrifice, like Jordan Peterson. He uses it both ways. That's a problem.\n\n4:12:32.880 --> 4:12:33.840\n You know Jordan?\n\n4:12:33.840 --> 4:12:37.040\n I don't know him personally. Jordan Peterson, I said. I didn't call him Jordan.\n\n4:12:37.040 --> 4:12:38.000\n Just wanted to be clear.\n\n4:12:38.000 --> 4:12:42.720\n Yeah. He uses it in his talks as... Sometimes he uses it just as I described it,\n\n4:12:43.440 --> 4:12:47.840\n and he's supportive of that, like the sacrifice Jesus made. And sometimes he uses it as an\n\n4:12:47.840 --> 4:12:55.040\n investment. But it's not. If you're giving money now, expecting a bigger return in the future,\n\n4:12:55.040 --> 4:12:58.960\n that's not a sacrifice. That's an investment. That's why we have two concepts for that.\n\n4:12:58.960 --> 4:13:07.120\n And the same is true if my wife is ill. And I've got a whole relationship built around what I'm\n\n4:13:07.120 --> 4:13:11.120\n giving. It's not that I'm not getting anything back. What I'm getting back is that she is\n\n4:13:11.120 --> 4:13:18.240\n recovering. Is that she's still alive or whatever it is that I'm keeping. That's the value that I'm\n\n4:13:18.240 --> 4:13:23.360\n getting in return. If I'm not getting that, why am I doing it? Because I signed a contract a long\n\n4:13:23.360 --> 4:13:30.080\n time ago. So it's not a sacrifice. Children are not a sacrifice. If I don't go to the movies,\n\n4:13:30.080 --> 4:13:34.560\n because I stay at home with my kids, it's because I love my kids more than I love going to the\n\n4:13:34.560 --> 4:13:39.040\n movies. And if I love going to the movies more than I love staying with the kids, then get a\n\n4:13:39.040 --> 4:13:46.480\n babysitter or don't have kids, which is the better approach. Here's a question. What book did Ayn Rand\n\n4:13:46.480 --> 4:13:51.280\n say is the most evil book in all of serious literature? It was Anna Karenina. And the reason\n\n4:13:51.280 --> 4:13:54.960\n it was that book, which I haven't read, please correct me if I get the plot wrong. What Rand was\n\n4:13:54.960 --> 4:13:59.600\n saying is the plot is a guy who's a big shot, I think. He marries a stupid girl who has nothing\n\n4:13:59.600 --> 4:14:04.000\n of value to offer him for at all. And she ends up killing herself. Whereas Rand's version, and we\n\n4:14:04.000 --> 4:14:09.680\n can take this out of the romantic context. I am delighted when I could be of use to my friends.\n\n4:14:10.320 --> 4:14:15.520\n It makes me feel wonderful and not in a kind of parasitic way. It's just like that I'm at a\n\n4:14:15.520 --> 4:14:19.360\n certain point where they call me up, they're having a problem and I've helped them with that problem.\n\n4:14:19.360 --> 4:14:25.760\n Anna Karenina, he gives up the love of his life. Oh, is that what it is? The amazing girl.\n\n4:14:26.320 --> 4:14:32.640\n He has an affair with her outside of marriage, taints her, is married to the stupid, but she gives\n\n4:14:32.640 --> 4:14:42.160\n him the prestige and everything. Oh, that's clearly very anti Rand. And the smart, the one he loves,\n\n4:14:42.160 --> 4:14:48.880\n she commits suicide in there. Okay, I got it wrong. So it's about him choosing\n\n4:14:49.680 --> 4:14:57.760\n mediocrity and nothingness over love. So pursuing your values is so crucial. So don't take it by\n\n4:14:57.760 --> 4:15:01.920\n saying, it doesn't mean that if you want to eat Chinese and she wants to eat Italian, you don't\n\n4:15:01.920 --> 4:15:08.720\n once in a while eat Italian on that day, right? That's silly, right? That's not a sacrifice,\n\n4:15:08.720 --> 4:15:13.840\n not in the sense in which we're talking about. It doesn't mean don't compromise. It doesn't mean\n\n4:15:13.840 --> 4:15:18.880\n don't compromise on the day to day stuff. It means don't compromise on moral values. You don't\n\n4:15:18.880 --> 4:15:25.200\n compromise on the big stuff and you never sacrifice. And that way you have a relationship\n\n4:15:25.200 --> 4:15:32.880\n that's built as equals and as you admire each other and love at the end of the day is a response\n\n4:15:32.880 --> 4:15:41.760\n to value. If you stop undermining your own value, the person who loves you will stop loving you,\n\n4:15:41.760 --> 4:15:48.320\n will love you less. If you love yourself less, you have to say, in order to say I love you,\n\n4:15:48.320 --> 4:15:54.560\n you have to be able to say the I, right? You have to be somebody, you have to know yourself,\n\n4:15:54.560 --> 4:16:01.520\n you have to have value. And so love is a profound emotional response to value.\n\n4:16:02.080 --> 4:16:07.280\n So speaking of love and the three of us being on this deserted island for a time together,\n\n4:16:07.280 --> 4:16:15.040\n somehow not murdering each other, let me ask you, Yaron, Michael, what is the most beautiful thing\n\n4:16:16.160 --> 4:16:21.040\n you find about the other? So let's go Yaron first. What do you think about Michael,\n\n4:16:21.040 --> 4:16:29.040\n that you appreciate about him? What do you get these questions from? What do you love about Michael?\n\n4:16:29.040 --> 4:16:33.440\n Then he's going to edit it. See, that makes sense to me. I just programmed him.\n\n4:16:33.440 --> 4:16:37.920\n Press play. It's all just a prerecorded message. So I've never met Michael before,\n\n4:16:37.920 --> 4:16:40.400\n so this is my... That's not true. You have and you're...\n\n4:16:40.400 --> 4:16:44.800\n I don't remember ever meeting Michael before. You're the very beginning of the new right,\n\n4:16:44.800 --> 4:16:47.280\n is me meeting you. I'm in the book?\n\n4:16:47.280 --> 4:16:49.280\n Yes. All right. Well, now I have to read his book\n\n4:16:49.280 --> 4:16:53.040\n because I mean, am I presented positively or negatively?\n\n4:16:53.040 --> 4:16:54.080\n Very. Oh, okay. Good.\n\n4:16:56.160 --> 4:16:58.000\n Lex is not so sure. He's like...\n\n4:16:58.000 --> 4:17:02.000\n I like that he goes, have I presented positively or negatively? I just go, very.\n\n4:17:04.000 --> 4:17:05.680\n And he's like, oh, good. I'm like, is it?\n\n4:17:08.080 --> 4:17:15.280\n So Michael Sharp, he's quick. He's funny, although some of the humor is beyond me.\n\n4:17:15.920 --> 4:17:18.480\n That's a nice way of saying he's very intelligent.\n\n4:17:18.480 --> 4:17:26.640\n Yeah. He's definitely very intelligent, but also very engaging. I think that's very engaging.\n\n4:17:26.640 --> 4:17:27.440\n I'm a sharp dresser.\n\n4:17:28.560 --> 4:17:32.560\n Oh, he's definitely... Well, yeah. I compliment him on stuff that's obvious\n\n4:17:32.560 --> 4:17:34.800\n and everybody can see by the video. The sex appeal.\n\n4:17:34.800 --> 4:17:37.200\n Let me also just comment, one thing you mentioned about\n\n4:17:38.000 --> 4:17:42.000\n you deriving joy from being of value to your friends.\n\n4:17:42.880 --> 4:17:48.080\n People talk to me about you sometimes because you'll do humor about various things and things\n\n4:17:48.080 --> 4:17:52.240\n like maybe you're some kind of a crazy person or something like that.\n\n4:17:53.520 --> 4:17:58.800\n Yeah. I know you enjoy this aspect of it, but I say that the reason I'm friends with Michael\n\n4:17:58.800 --> 4:18:04.240\n is there's real love there. And the kind of kindness you give to your friends,\n\n4:18:04.240 --> 4:18:10.240\n to people that are close to you, to your family is amazing, man.\n\n4:18:10.240 --> 4:18:17.200\n So that's one of my favorite things about you. Your intellect aside, your philosophies aside,\n\n4:18:17.200 --> 4:18:20.960\n your humor aside, I think there's a lot of love in you. That's what I really appreciate.\n\n4:18:20.960 --> 4:18:24.720\n But enough about you. I'm actually getting sick of saying nice things about you.\n\n4:18:24.720 --> 4:18:27.120\n You're always going to say it.\n\n4:18:27.120 --> 4:18:27.840\n Take it all back.\n\n4:18:29.920 --> 4:18:34.960\n Can I say one thing? You're joking, but this is something that's very key and this is something\n\n4:18:34.960 --> 4:18:42.560\n in a random context. It is very disturbing, and this is not by accident, how in our culture it is\n\n4:18:42.560 --> 4:18:48.960\n pooh poohed to show kindness, earnestness, appreciation, to tell someone. You see this\n\n4:18:48.960 --> 4:18:53.520\n on Twitter where someone's like, you know what? I read your book. It's made my life a lot better.\n\n4:18:53.520 --> 4:18:59.600\n Okay, simp. And there's a real, and this very much comes out of urban media circles,\n\n4:18:59.600 --> 4:19:06.480\n there's this real disdain for showing appreciation, for showing happiness, for showing kindness.\n\n4:19:06.480 --> 4:19:11.680\n And now that I've called it out, you'll notice it. But when you see how common it is and how people\n\n4:19:11.680 --> 4:19:17.200\n can't take compliments, the effects of that are extreme and extremely negative.\n\n4:19:17.200 --> 4:19:22.480\n I got to say about Texas, one of the things, so Austin especially, I mean, I don't really\n\n4:19:22.480 --> 4:19:27.840\n fully know Texas, Texas, but Austin, the friendliness. There's a reason I've gotten\n\n4:19:27.840 --> 4:19:33.440\n fatter and been drinking a lot is all the friendliness from random people who are no\n\n4:19:33.440 --> 4:19:39.280\n longer random. They're just friends. I've made more friends in one week than I have in my entire\n\n4:19:39.280 --> 4:19:45.600\n stay in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Exactly. One and a half. You know what the number two means?\n\n4:19:46.640 --> 4:19:52.720\n I've never counted up that high. So this is what happens when people are free.\n\n4:19:52.720 --> 4:19:55.200\n No. When people are free and individualistic,\n\n4:19:55.200 --> 4:20:00.800\n it's exact opposite of what people believe. The more collectivist we are, the less free we are,\n\n4:20:00.800 --> 4:20:05.600\n the nastier we are to one another. Individualists who are pursuing their own happiness are incredibly\n\n4:20:05.600 --> 4:20:11.920\n kind, friendly, and supportive people. Okay. And now your task with doing...\n\n4:20:11.920 --> 4:20:12.960\n Talk about bad juju.\n\n4:20:14.880 --> 4:20:21.840\n To practice what you preach, is there in your soul that you can find one beautiful thing to\n\n4:20:21.840 --> 4:20:26.560\n say about Yaron now that you guys met for the first, second, or third time, or at least in\n\n4:20:26.560 --> 4:20:34.240\n book format? So that's an easy one. So what I like about Yaron is that I think he is taking\n\n4:20:34.240 --> 4:20:40.480\n one of the problems with maybe more old school objectivism is that they would just use Rand's\n\n4:20:40.480 --> 4:20:45.280\n arguments in Rand's way. And it's like, you're a parent, you're not adding anything, and you're\n\n4:20:45.280 --> 4:20:50.800\n not going to be better than her. So you give this talk about, I think you can compare, was it Bill\n\n4:20:50.800 --> 4:20:55.600\n Gates to who was the one who went to jail? Oh, Bernie Madoff.\n\n4:20:55.600 --> 4:21:00.480\n To Bernie Madoff. And you make the point, you're like, does anyone here really think Bernie Madoff\n\n4:21:00.480 --> 4:21:04.800\n was happy? Like, yeah, he's successful and he's wealthy, but does he go to bed being like,\n\n4:21:04.800 --> 4:21:08.800\n hey, I'm a great guy? No. And his son kills himself with all this tragedy that goes with him.\n\n4:21:08.800 --> 4:21:15.920\n So I think anyone who takes an ideology or worldview that I think is of value and adds to it\n\n4:21:15.920 --> 4:21:22.320\n and makes it and articulates it in a new way, I think is a great accomplishment. I like how\n\n4:21:22.320 --> 4:21:31.920\n uncompromising you are in your views of putting her views forward. And I like how you illustrate\n\n4:21:31.920 --> 4:21:37.520\n how silly it is to argue against anarchism. So I don't really have to do any of the work.\n\n4:21:37.520 --> 4:21:44.000\n As for you, and this, I've thought this before many times, you're the first person I met who\n\n4:21:44.000 --> 4:21:48.400\n I come at, literally the first, other than my friend who I went to yeshiva with as a kid,\n\n4:21:48.400 --> 4:21:53.760\n who I come at us, there was a line on friends where Ross and Rachel were thinking of dating,\n\n4:21:53.760 --> 4:21:59.360\n right? And they go, if we start dating, it would be like the third date because they knew each\n\n4:21:59.360 --> 4:22:02.400\n other well. And then she's like, yeah, but it'd be like, so it's like a plus and a minus, like,\n\n4:22:02.400 --> 4:22:06.960\n yeah, you're fast forwarding to seriousness, but it's also the fact that you and I have the same\n\n4:22:06.960 --> 4:22:12.320\n background. Like I can sit with your own or any of my other friends and try to explain it. The fact\n\n4:22:12.320 --> 4:22:18.480\n that intuitively you and I grew up the same. And I know that we have that background in common\n\n4:22:18.480 --> 4:22:23.680\n does create a bond because I feel even if I haven't told you certain things, you are going\n\n4:22:23.680 --> 4:22:28.960\n to understand me a lot better than many of my friends who've known me for a long time. I also\n\n4:22:28.960 --> 4:22:36.080\n really like how I feel. This is a very new age term, but I'm going to use it. I feel very seen\n\n4:22:36.080 --> 4:22:43.200\n when I talk to you. I think you see me for who I am. You appreciate me for who I am. And I also\n\n4:22:43.200 --> 4:22:51.200\n really like how, and this is increasingly common as my platform increases. So I'm very flattered\n\n4:22:51.200 --> 4:22:56.240\n by this. You understand what I'm trying to do and you don't try to get in the way, even though it's\n\n4:22:56.240 --> 4:23:02.080\n your show. You're like, okay, this guy's a performer. He's doing his thing. People appreciate\n\n4:23:02.080 --> 4:23:08.960\n it. I appreciate it. I'm not going to try to drive the car. And I think some people who are who are\n\n4:23:08.960 --> 4:23:13.200\n bad and I have not encountered this because I would shoot it down. But I think a lot of times\n\n4:23:13.200 --> 4:23:18.960\n people have a tendency when they're hosts to try to drive the car. And it's like these things work\n\n4:23:19.600 --> 4:23:24.080\n when we come in here. None of us prepare. You prepare by me. None of us talking beforehand\n\n4:23:24.080 --> 4:23:28.240\n and like make it spontaneous. And the audience really enjoys that more because they know it's\n\n4:23:28.240 --> 4:23:34.320\n real earnest and dynamic. Yeah. I enjoy having you drive the car, even though I believe you don't\n\n4:23:34.320 --> 4:23:39.200\n have a license. And you think we're going to crash. No, I think he's, he's an extraordinary\n\n4:23:39.200 --> 4:23:45.600\n interviewer because of all those things. He makes you feel visible. And, and he does, but he also\n\n4:23:45.600 --> 4:23:52.160\n comes across as really honest. The questions are really questions that you seem really interested\n\n4:23:52.160 --> 4:23:59.840\n in that you really want answers to. It doesn't come across as canned or I prepared my three\n\n4:24:00.880 --> 4:24:07.040\n book project. Thank you. Thank you, Michael. I was pretty sure that on a desert island,\n\n4:24:07.040 --> 4:24:12.480\n this would end in murder, but now I believe it may. Well, given his comments on anarchy,\n\n4:24:12.480 --> 4:24:20.720\n it might still. It might still. The day is young. The night is young. This is a huge honor. I've\n\n4:24:20.720 --> 4:24:25.280\n been a fan of both of you separately for a long time. I really appreciate wasting all this time\n\n4:24:25.280 --> 4:24:32.160\n with me today. I love you, Michael. I love you, Yaron. We love you too. Thanks for listening to\n\n4:24:32.160 --> 4:24:38.960\n this conversation with Michael Malice and Yaron Brook. And thank you to ground news, public goods,\n\n4:24:38.960 --> 4:24:44.880\n athletic greens, brave and four Sigmatic. Check them out in the description to support this\n\n4:24:44.880 --> 4:24:52.000\n podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx. Surround yourself with people who\n\n4:24:52.000 --> 4:24:58.960\n make you happy. People who make you laugh, who help you when you're in need. People who genuinely\n\n4:24:58.960 --> 4:25:05.280\n care. They are the ones worth keeping in your life. Everyone else is just passing through.\n\n4:25:05.280 --> 4:25:14.000\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
