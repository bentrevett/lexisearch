--> 00:09.840\n working on the Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment\n\n00:09.840 --> 00:13.000\n that specializes in investigating the slight differences\n\n00:13.000 --> 00:15.280\n between matter and antimatter\n\n00:15.280 --> 00:18.400\n by studying a type of particle called the beauty quark\n\n00:18.400 --> 00:19.880\n or b quark.\n\n00:19.880 --> 00:22.280\n In this way, he's part of the group of physicists\n\n00:22.280 --> 00:25.120\n who are searching for the evidence of new particles\n\n00:25.120 --> 00:26.920\n that can answer some of the biggest questions\n\n00:26.920 --> 00:28.280\n in modern physics.\n\n00:28.280 --> 00:31.840\n He's also an exceptional communicator of science\n\n00:31.840 --> 00:34.880\n with some of the clearest and most captivating explanations\n\n00:34.880 --> 00:37.440\n of basic concepts in particle physicists\n\n00:37.440 --> 00:39.560\n that I've ever heard.\n\n00:39.560 --> 00:42.960\n So when I visited London, I knew I had to talk to him.\n\n00:42.960 --> 00:44.920\n And we did this conversation\n\n00:44.920 --> 00:47.280\n at the Royal Institute Lecture Theatre,\n\n00:47.280 --> 00:50.520\n which has hosted lectures for over two centuries\n\n00:50.520 --> 00:52.120\n from some of the greatest scientists\n\n00:52.120 --> 00:54.160\n and science communicators in history,\n\n00:54.160 --> 00:57.680\n from Michael Faraday to Carl Sagan.\n\n00:57.680 --> 00:59.080\n This conversation was recorded\n\n00:59.080 --> 01:01.240\n before the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n01:01.240 --> 01:03.440\n For everyone feeling the medical and psychological\n\n01:03.440 --> 01:05.440\n and financial burden of this crisis,\n\n01:05.440 --> 01:07.360\n I'm sending love your way.\n\n01:07.360 --> 01:08.400\n Stay strong.\n\n01:08.400 --> 01:09.560\n We're in this together.\n\n01:09.560 --> 01:11.160\n We'll beat this thing.\n\n01:11.160 --> 01:13.840\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:13.840

now\n\n01:27.120 --> 01:28.400\n and never any ads in the middle\n\n01:28.400 --> 01:30.560\n that can break the flow of the conversation.\n\n01:30.560 --> 01:31.880\n I hope that works for you\n\n01:31.880 --> 01:35.040\n and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n01:35.040 --> 01:36.480\n Quick summary of the ads.\n\n01:36.480 --> 01:40.000\n Two sponsors, ExpressVPN and Cash App.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:41.680\n Please consider supporting the podcast\n\n01:41.680 --> 01:46.680\n by getting ExpressVPN at expressvpn.com slash lexpod\n\n01:46.720 --> 01:50.880\n and downloading Cash App and using code lexpodcast.\n\n01:50.880 --> 01:52.800\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n01:52.800 --> 01:55.200\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n01:55.200 -->

little as $1.\n\n02:04.480 --> 02:06.800\n Since Cash App does fractional share trading,\n\n02:06.800 --> 02:09.600\n let me mention that the order execution algorithm\n\n02:09.600 --> 02:11.000\n that works behind the scenes\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.720\n to create the abstraction of the fractional orders\n\n02:13.720 --> 02:15.800\n is an algorithmic marvel.\n\n02:15.800 --> 02:17.720\n So big props to the Cash App engineers\n\n02:17.720 --> 02:20.200\n for solving a hard problem that in the end\n\n02:20.200 --> 02:22.680\n provides an easy interface that takes a step up\n\n02:22.680 --> 02:25.720\n to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market,\n\n02:25.720 --> 02:28.560\n making trading more accessible for new investors\n\n02:28.560 --> 02:31.480\n and diversification much easier.\n\n02:31.480 --> 02:34.840\n So again, you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play\n\n02:34.840 --> 02:38.400\n and use the code lexpodcast, you get $10\n\n02:38.400 --> 02:41.520\n and

things\n\n03:54.160 --> 03:56.140\n that human beings have ever created,\n\n03:56.140 --> 03:58.980\n the Large Hadron Collider, OHC.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:00.940\n What is it?\n\n04:00.940 --> 04:02.180\n How does it work?\n\n04:02.180 --> 04:05.260\n Okay, so it's essentially this gigantic\n\n04:05.260 --> 04:08.340\n 27 kilometer circumference particle accelerator.\n\n04:08.340 --> 04:09.540\n It's this big ring.\n\n04:09.540 --> 04:12.100\n It's buried about 100 meters underneath the surface\n\n04:12.100 --> 04:14.700\n in the countryside just outside Geneva in Switzerland.\n\n04:14.700 --> 04:17.060\n And really what it's for, ultimately,\n\n04:17.060 --> 04:20.380\n is to try to understand what are the basic building blocks\n\n04:20.380 --> 04:21.640\n of the universe.\n\n04:21.640 --> 04:23.060\n So you can think of it in a way\n\n04:23.060 --> 04:24.540\n as like a gigantic microscope,\n\n04:24.540 --> 04:28.500\n and the analogy is actually fairly precise, so.\n\n04:28.500 --> 04:30.060\n Gigantic microscope.\n\n04:30.060 --> 04:32.580\n Effectively, except it's a microscope\n\n04:32.580 --> 04:36.180\n that looks at the structure of the vacuum.\n\n04:36.180 --> 04:39.520\n In order for this kind of thing to study particles,\n\n04:40.500 --> 04:44.420\n which are the microscopic entities, it has to be huge.\n\n04:44.420 --> 04:45.780\n It's a gigantic microscope.\n\n04:45.780 --> 04:48.580\n So what do you mean by studying vacuum?\n\n04:48.580 --> 04:51.960\n Okay, so I mean, so particle physics as a field\n\n04:51.960 --> 04:53.460\n is kind of badly named in a way,\n\n04:53.460 --> 04:56.620\n because particles are not the fundamental ingredients\n\n04:56.620 --> 04:57.740\n of the universe.\n\n04:57.740 --> 04:58.940\n They're not fundamental at all.\n\n04:58.940 --> 05:00.180\n So the things that we believe\n\n05:00.180 --> 05:02.340\n are the real building blocks of the universe\n\n05:02.340 --> 05:05.420\n are objects, invisible fluid like objects\n\n05:05.420 --> 05:07.420\n called quantum fields.\n\n05:07.420 --> 05:10.200\n So these are fields like the magnetic field\n\n05:10.200 --> 05:12.620\n around a magnet that exists everywhere in space.\n\n05:12.620 --> 05:13.620\n They're always there.\n\n05:13.620 --> 05:15.020\n In fact, actually, it's funny that we're\n\n05:15.020 --> 05:15.860\n in the Royal Institution,\n\n05:15.860 --> 05:19.000\n because this is where the idea of the field\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.260\n was effectively invented by Michael Faraday\n\n05:21.260 --> 05:23.840\n doing experiments with magnets and coils of wire.\n\n05:23.840 --> 05:26.060\n So he noticed that, you know,\n\n05:26.060 --> 05:28.420\n it was a very famous experiment that he did\n\n05:28.420 --> 05:31.220\n where he got a magnet and put on top of it a piece of paper\n\n05:31.220 --> 05:32.680\n and then sprinkled iron filings.\n\n05:32.680 --> 05:34.620\n And he found the iron filings arranged themselves\n\n05:34.620 --> 05:36.420\n into these kind of loops,\n\n05:37.460 --> 05:40.300\n which was actually mapping out the invisible influence\n\n05:40.300 --> 05:42.400\n of this magnetic field, which is a thing, you know,\n\n05:42.400 --> 05:44.740\n we've all experienced, we've all felt, held a magnet\n\n05:44.740 --> 05:46.500\n or two poles of magnet and pushed them together\n\n05:46.500 --> 05:48.620\n and felt this thing, this force pushing back.\n\n05:48.620 --> 05:51.020\n So these are real physical objects.\n\n05:51.020 --> 05:53.820\n And the way we think of particles in modern physics\n\n05:53.820 --> 05:56.660\n is that they are essentially little vibrations,\n\n05:56.660 --> 06:00.260\n little ripples in these otherwise invisible fields\n\n06:00.260 --> 06:01.420\n that are everywhere.\n\n06:01.420 --> 06:03.260\n They fill the whole universe.\n\n06:03.260 --> 06:05.860\n You know, I don't, I apologize perhaps\n\n06:05.860 --> 06:07.420\n for the ridiculous question.\n\n06:07.420 --> 06:10.240\n Are you comfortable with the idea\n\n06:10.240 --> 06:14.140\n of the fundamental nature of our reality being fields?\n\n06:14.140 --> 06:17.540\n Because to me, particles, you know,\n\n06:17.540 --> 06:20.620\n a bunch of different building blocks makes more sense\n\n06:20.620 --> 06:22.600\n sort of intellectually, sort of visually,\n\n06:22.600 --> 06:26.680\n like it seems to, I seem to be able to visualize\n\n06:26.680 --> 06:28.620\n that kind of idea easier.\n\n06:28.620 --> 06:31.740\n Are you comfortable psychologically with the idea\n\n06:31.740 --> 06:35.300\n that the basic building block is not a block, but a field?\n\n06:35.300 --> 06:38.220\n I think it's, I think it's quite a magical idea.\n\n06:38.220 --> 06:39.400\n I find it quite appealing.\n\n06:39.400 --> 06:42.020\n And it's, well, it comes from a misunderstanding\n\n06:42.020 --> 06:43.180\n of what particles are.\n\n06:43.180 --> 06:45.460\n So like when you, when we do science at school\n\n06:45.460 --> 06:46.740\n and we draw a picture of an atom,\n\n06:46.740 --> 06:49.180\n you draw like, you know, a nucleus with some protons\n\n06:49.180 --> 06:50.940\n and neutrons, these little spheres in the middle,\n\n06:50.940 --> 06:53.540\n and then you have some electrons that are like little flies\n\n06:53.540 --> 06:54.820\n flying around the atom.\n\n06:54.820 --> 06:56.460\n And that is a completely misleading picture\n\n06:56.460 --> 06:57.700\n of what an atom is like.\n\n06:57.700 --> 06:58.540\n It's nothing like that.\n\n06:58.540 --> 07:01.980\n The electron is not like a little planet orbiting the atom.\n\n07:01.980 --> 07:05.900\n It's this spread out, wibbly wobbly wave like thing.\n\n07:05.900 --> 07:07.420\n And we know we've known that since, you know,\n\n07:07.420 --> 07:10.140\n the early 20th century, thanks to quantum mechanics.\n\n07:10.140 --> 07:13.220\n So when we, we, we carry on using this word particle\n\n07:13.220 --> 07:15.780\n because sometimes when we do experiments,\n\n07:15.780 --> 07:17.980\n particles do behave like they're little marbles\n\n07:17.980 --> 07:19.260\n or little bullets, you know.\n\n07:19.260 --> 07:22.580\n So in the LHC, when we collide particles together,\n\n07:22.580 --> 07:25.080\n you'll get, you know, you'll get like hundreds of particles\n\n07:25.080 --> 07:26.300\n all flying out through the detector\n\n07:26.300 --> 07:28.660\n and they all take a trajectory and you can see\n\n07:28.660 --> 07:29.940\n from the detector where they've gone\n\n07:29.940 --> 07:31.420\n and they look like they're little bullets.\n\n07:31.420 --> 07:35.380\n So they behave that way, you know, a lot of the time.\n\n07:35.380 --> 07:37.620\n When you really study them carefully,\n\n07:37.620 --> 07:40.100\n you'll see that they are not little spheres.\n\n07:40.100 --> 07:43.220\n They are these ethereal disturbances\n\n07:43.220 --> 07:44.940\n in these underlying fields.\n\n07:44.940 --> 07:48.460\n So this is really how we think nature is,\n\n07:48.460 --> 07:51.640\n which is surprising, but also I think kind of magic.\n\n07:51.640 --> 07:54.580\n So, you know, we are, our bodies are basically made up\n\n07:54.580 --> 07:56.860\n of like little knots of energy\n\n07:56.860 --> 08:00.280\n in these invisible objects that are all around us.\n\n08:00.280 --> 08:05.280\n And what is the story of the vacuum when it comes to LHC?\n\n08:07.760 --> 08:09.920\n So why did you mention the word vacuum?\n\n08:09.920 --> 08:13.040\n Okay, so if we just, if we go back to like the physics,\n\n08:13.040 --> 08:13.920\n we do know.\n\n08:13.920 --> 08:16.320\n So atoms are made of electrons,\n\n08:16.320 --> 08:18.260\n which were discovered a hundred or so years ago.\n\n08:18.260 --> 08:20.000\n And then in the nucleus of the atom,\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:21.720\n you have two other types of particles.\n\n08:21.720 --> 08:23.480\n There's an up, something called an up quark\n\n08:23.480 --> 08:24.420\n and a down quark.\n\n08:24.420 --> 08:27.920\n And those three particles make up every atom in the universe.\n\n08:27.920 --> 08:30.640\n So we think of these as ripples in fields.\n\n08:30.640 --> 08:34.300\n So there is something called the electron field\n\n08:34.300 --> 08:37.440\n and every electron in the universe is a ripple moving\n\n08:37.440 --> 08:39.080\n about in this electron field.\n\n08:39.080 --> 08:40.800\n So the electron field is all around us, we can't see it,\n\n08:40.800 --> 08:42.920\n but every electron in our body is a little ripple\n\n08:42.920 --> 08:45.600\n in this thing that's there all the time.\n\n08:45.600 --> 08:46.960\n And the quark fields are the same.\n\n08:46.960 --> 08:48.960\n So there's an up quark field and an up quark\n\n08:48.960 --> 08:50.240\n is a little ripple in the up quark field.\n\n08:50.240 --> 08:51.720\n And the down quark is a little ripple\n\n08:51.720 --> 08:53.340\n in something else called the down quark field.\n\n08:53.340 --> 08:55.000\n So these fields are always there.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:58.880\n Now there are potentially, we know about a certain number\n\n08:58.880 --> 09:00.440\n of fields in what we call the standard model\n\n09:00.440 --> 09:01.320\n of particle physics.\n\n09:01.320 --> 09:04.040\n And the most recent one we discovered was the Higgs field.\n\n09:04.040 --> 09:07.080\n And the way we discovered the Higgs field\n\n09:07.080 --> 09:08.620\n was to make a little ripple in it.\n\n09:08.620 --> 09:12.520\n So what the LHC did, it fired two protons into each other,\n\n09:12.520 --> 09:14.920\n very, very hard with enough energy\n\n09:14.920 --> 09:18.460\n that you could create a disturbance in this Higgs field.\n\n09:18.460 --> 09:20.840\n And that's what shows up as what we call the Higgs boson.\n\n09:20.840 --> 09:22.940\n So this particle that everyone was going on about\n\n09:22.940 --> 09:25.800\n eight or so years ago is proof really,\n\n09:25.800 --> 09:28.500\n the particle in itself is, I mean, it's interesting,\n\n09:28.500 --> 09:30.620\n but the thing that's really interesting is the field.\n\n09:30.620 --> 09:33.900\n Because it's the Higgs field that we believe\n\n09:33.900 --> 09:38.280\n is the reason that electrons and quarks have mass.\n\n09:38.280 --> 09:41.000\n And it's that invisible field that's always there\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.480\n that gives mass to the particles.\n\n09:42.480 --> 09:44.360\n The Higgs boson is just our way\n\n09:44.360 --> 09:46.340\n of checking it's there basically.\n\n09:46.340 --> 09:49.160\n And so the Large Hadron Collider,\n\n09:49.160 --> 09:51.900\n in order to get that ripple in the Higgs field,\n\n09:51.900 --> 09:54.380\n it requires a huge amount of energy.\n\n09:54.380 --> 09:55.220\n Yeah, I suppose.\n\n09:55.220 --> 09:57.000\n And so that's why you need this huge,\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:58.360\n that's why size matters here.\n\n09:58.360 --> 10:01.440\n So maybe there's a million questions here,\n\n10:01.440 --> 10:02.640\n but let's backtrack.\n\n10:02.640 --> 10:07.640\n Why does size matter in the context of a particle collider?\n\n10:09.960 --> 10:14.960\n So why does bigger allow you for higher energy collisions?\n\n10:15.760 --> 10:18.500\n Right, so the reason, well, it's kind of simple really,\n\n10:18.500 --> 10:21.080\n which is that there are two types of particle accelerator\n\n10:21.080 --> 10:21.920\n that you can build.\n\n10:21.920 --> 10:23.640\n One is circular, which is like the LHC,\n\n10:23.640 --> 10:25.680\n the other is a great long line.\n\n10:25.680 --> 10:28.560\n So the advantage of a circular machine\n\n10:28.560 --> 10:30.580\n is that you can send particles around a ring\n\n10:30.580 --> 10:32.560\n and you can give them a kick every time they go around.\n\n10:32.560 --> 10:34.700\n So imagine you have a, there's actually a bit of the LHC,\n\n10:34.700 --> 10:36.800\n that's about only 30 meters long,\n\n10:36.800 --> 10:38.720\n where you have a bunch of metal boxes,\n\n10:38.720 --> 10:41.800\n which have oscillating 2 million volt electric fields\n\n10:41.800 --> 10:44.360\n inside them, which are timed so that when a proton\n\n10:44.360 --> 10:45.560\n goes through one of these boxes,\n\n10:45.560 --> 10:48.240\n the field it sees as it approaches is attractive.\n\n10:48.240 --> 10:49.200\n And then as it leaves the box,\n\n10:49.200 --> 10:51.240\n it flips and becomes repulsive\n\n10:51.240 --> 10:52.520\n and the proton gets attracted\n\n10:52.520 --> 10:55.060\n and kicked out the other side, so it gets a bit faster.\n\n10:55.060 --> 10:57.160\n So you send it, and then you send it back round again.\n\n10:57.160 --> 10:59.440\n And it's incredible, like the timing of that,\n\n10:59.440 --> 11:01.160\n the synchronization, wait, really?\n\n11:01.160 --> 11:02.760\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n11:02.760 --> 11:05.520\n I think there's going to be a multiplicative effect\n\n11:05.520 --> 11:06.720\n on the questions I have.\n\n11:06.720 --> 11:10.880\n Is, okay, let me just take that attention for a second.\n\n11:12.520 --> 11:15.120\n The orchestration of that, is that fundamentally\n\n11:15.120 --> 11:17.600\n a hardware problem or a software problem?\n\n11:17.600 --> 11:20.120\n Like what, how do you get that?\n\n11:20.120 --> 11:22.680\n I mean, I should first of all say, I'm not an engineer.\n\n11:22.680 --> 11:24.640\n So the guys, I did not build the LHC,\n\n11:24.640 --> 11:26.840\n so they're people much, much better at this stuff than I.\n\n11:26.840 --> 11:28.240\n For sure, but maybe.\n\n11:30.120 --> 11:33.680\n But from your sort of intuition,\n\n11:33.680 --> 11:37.440\n from the echoes of what you understand,\n\n11:37.440 --> 11:40.560\n what you heard of how it's designed, what's your sense?\n\n11:40.560 --> 11:43.360\n What's the engineering aspects of it?\n\n11:43.360 --> 11:45.400\n The acceleration bit is not challenging.\n\n11:45.400 --> 11:47.120\n Okay, I mean, okay, there's always challenges\n\n11:47.120 --> 11:50.280\n with everything, but basically you have these,\n\n11:50.280 --> 11:53.600\n the beams that go around the LHC, the beams of particles\n\n11:53.600 --> 11:55.480\n are divided into little bunches.\n\n11:55.480 --> 11:57.800\n So they're called, they're a bit like swarms of bees,\n\n11:57.800 --> 12:00.280\n if you like, and there are around,\n\n12:00.280 --> 12:04.040\n I think it's something of the order 2000 bunches\n\n12:04.040 --> 12:05.280\n spaced around the ring.\n\n12:05.280 --> 12:07.800\n And they, if you're at a given point on the ring,\n\n12:07.800 --> 12:10.120\n counting bunches, you get 40 million bunches\n\n12:10.120 --> 12:11.240\n passing you every second.\n\n12:11.240 --> 12:14.200\n So they come in like cars going past\n\n12:14.200 --> 12:16.000\n on a very fast motorway.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:18.280\n So you need to have, if you're an electric field\n\n12:18.280 --> 12:20.400\n that you're using to accelerate the particles,\n\n12:20.400 --> 12:23.800\n that needs to be timed so that as a bunch of protons arrives,\n\n12:23.800 --> 12:26.080\n it's got the right sign to attract them\n\n12:26.080 --> 12:27.600\n and then flips at the right moment.\n\n12:27.600 --> 12:29.600\n But I think the voltage in those boxes\n\n12:29.600 --> 12:31.200\n oscillates at hundreds of megahertz.\n\n12:31.200 --> 12:33.280\n So the beams are like 40 megahertz,\n\n12:33.280 --> 12:35.200\n but it's oscillating much more quickly than the beam.\n\n12:35.200 --> 12:37.640\n So I think it's difficult engineering,\n\n12:37.640 --> 12:41.480\n but in principle, it's not a really serious challenge.\n\n12:41.480 --> 12:42.320\n The bigger problem.\n\n12:42.320 --> 12:44.600\n There's probably engineers like screaming at you right now.\n\n12:44.600 --> 12:46.400\n Probably, but I mean, okay.\n\n12:46.400 --> 12:47.880\n So in terms of coming back to this thing,\n\n12:47.880 --> 12:48.760\n why is it so big?\n\n12:48.760 --> 12:51.520\n Well, the reason is you wanna get the particles\n\n12:51.520 --> 12:54.160\n through that accelerating element over and over again.\n\n12:54.160 --> 12:55.280\n So you wanna bring them back round.\n\n12:55.280 --> 12:56.320\n So that's why it's round.\n\n12:56.320 --> 12:58.640\n The question is why couldn't you make it smaller?\n\n12:58.640 --> 13:01.360\n Well, the basic answer is that these particles\n\n13:01.360 --> 13:03.120\n are going unbelievably quickly.\n\n13:03.120 --> 13:08.120\n So they travel at 99.9999991% of the speed of light\n\n13:09.880 --> 13:11.360\n in the LHC.\n\n13:11.360 --> 13:12.520\n And if you think about, say,\n\n13:12.520 --> 13:16.040\n driving your car around a corner at high speed,\n\n13:16.040 --> 13:19.520\n if you go fast, you need a lot of friction in the tires\n\n13:19.520 --> 13:21.200\n to make sure you don't slide off the road.\n\n13:21.200 --> 13:26.200\n So the limiting factor is how powerful a magnet can you make\n\n13:26.560 --> 13:28.480\n because what we do is magnets are used\n\n13:28.480 --> 13:30.960\n to bend the particles around the ring.\n\n13:30.960 --> 13:33.120\n And essentially the LHC, when it was designed,\n\n13:33.120 --> 13:35.200\n was designed with the most powerful magnets\n\n13:35.200 --> 13:37.920\n that could conceivably be built at the time.\n\n13:37.920 --> 13:40.400\n And so that's your kind of limiting factor.\n\n13:40.400 --> 13:41.800\n So if you wanted to make the machine smaller,\n\n13:41.800 --> 13:42.840\n that means a tighter bend,\n\n13:42.840 --> 13:44.280\n you need to have a more powerful magnet.\n\n13:44.280 --> 13:48.200\n So it's this toss up between how strong are your magnets\n\n13:48.200 --> 13:49.920\n versus how big a tunnel can you afford.\n\n13:49.920 --> 13:51.560\n The bigger the tunnel, the weaker the magnets can be.\n\n13:51.560 --> 13:54.080\n The smaller the tunnel, the stronger they've gotta be.\n\n13:54.080 --> 13:57.680\n Okay, so maybe can we backtrack to the Standard Model\n\n13:57.680 --> 14:00.800\n and say what kind of particles there are, period,\n\n14:00.800 --> 14:04.560\n and maybe the history of kind of assembling\n\n14:04.560 --> 14:06.880\n that the Standard Model of physics\n\n14:06.880 --> 14:10.400\n and then how that leads up to the hopes and dreams\n\n14:10.400 --> 14:12.800\n and the accomplishments of the Large Hadron Collider.\n\n14:12.800 --> 14:14.000\n Yeah, sure, okay.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.720\n So all of 20th century physics in like five minutes.\n\n14:16.720 --> 14:17.560\n Yeah, please.\n\n14:17.560 --> 14:21.280\n Okay, so, okay, the story really begins properly.\n\n14:21.280 --> 14:24.760\n End of the 19th century, the basic view of matter\n\n14:24.760 --> 14:26.720\n is that matter is made of atoms\n\n14:26.720 --> 14:30.280\n and the atoms are indestructible, immutable little spheres\n\n14:30.280 --> 14:31.480\n like the things we were talking about\n\n14:31.480 --> 14:32.600\n that don't really exist.\n\n14:32.600 --> 14:35.280\n And there's one atom for every chemical element.\n\n14:35.280 --> 14:36.880\n So there's an atom for hydrogen, for helium,\n\n14:36.880 --> 14:39.800\n for carbon, for iron, et cetera, and they're all different.\n\n14:39.800 --> 14:41.880\n Then in 1897, experiments done\n\n14:41.880 --> 14:43.280\n at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge,\n\n14:43.280 --> 14:45.840\n which is where I'm still, where I'm based,\n\n14:45.840 --> 14:48.720\n showed that there are actually smaller particles\n\n14:48.720 --> 14:51.640\n inside the atom, which eventually became known as electrons.\n\n14:51.640 --> 14:53.200\n So these are these negatively charged things\n\n14:53.200 --> 14:54.840\n that go around the outside.\n\n14:54.840 --> 14:57.080\n A few years later, Ernest Rutherford,\n\n14:57.080 --> 14:58.680\n very famous nuclear physicist,\n\n14:58.680 --> 15:00.000\n one of the pioneers of nuclear physics\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.480\n shows that the atom has a tiny nugget in the center,\n\n15:03.480 --> 15:04.400\n which we call the nucleus,\n\n15:04.400 --> 15:05.840\n which is a positively charged object.\n\n15:05.840 --> 15:09.080\n So then by like 1910, 11, we have this model of the atom\n\n15:09.080 --> 15:09.960\n that we learn in school,\n\n15:09.960 --> 15:13.240\n which is you've got a nucleus, electrons go around it.\n\n15:13.240 --> 15:16.280\n Fast forward a few years, the nucleus,\n\n15:16.280 --> 15:18.480\n people start doing experiments with radioactivity\n\n15:18.480 --> 15:20.840\n where they use alpha particles\n\n15:20.840 --> 15:24.520\n that are spat out of radioactive elements as bullets,\n\n15:24.520 --> 15:26.800\n and they fire them at other atoms.\n\n15:26.800 --> 15:28.560\n And by banging things into each other,\n\n15:28.560 --> 15:31.200\n they see that they can knock bits out of the nucleus.\n\n15:31.200 --> 15:33.880\n So these things come out called protons, first of all,\n\n15:33.880 --> 15:36.040\n which are positively charged particles\n\n15:36.040 --> 15:38.800\n about 2000 times heavier than the electron.\n\n15:38.800 --> 15:41.160\n And then 10 years later, more or less,\n\n15:41.160 --> 15:43.880\n a neutral particle is discovered called the neutron.\n\n15:43.880 --> 15:47.000\n So those are the three basic building blocks of atoms.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.400\n You have protons and neutrons in the nucleus\n\n15:49.400 --> 15:51.800\n that are stuck together by something called the strong force,\n\n15:51.800 --> 15:53.200\n the strong nuclear force,\n\n15:53.200 --> 15:55.800\n and you have electrons in orbit around that,\n\n15:55.800 --> 15:57.920\n held in by the electromagnetic force,\n\n15:57.920 --> 16:00.440\n which is one of the forces of nature.\n\n16:00.440 --> 16:03.840\n That's sort of where we get to by like 1932, more or less.\n\n16:04.840 --> 16:07.440\n Then what happens is physics is nice and neat.\n\n16:07.440 --> 16:09.520\n In 1932, everything looks great, got three particles\n\n16:09.520 --> 16:11.160\n and all the atoms are made of, that's fine.\n\n16:11.160 --> 16:13.960\n But then cloud chamber experiments.\n\n16:13.960 --> 16:16.000\n These are devices that can be used to,\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.600\n the first device is capable of imaging subatomic particles\n\n16:18.600 --> 16:19.600\n so you can see their tracks.\n\n16:19.600 --> 16:21.760\n And they're used to study cosmic rays,\n\n16:21.760 --> 16:23.760\n particles that come from outer space\n\n16:23.760 --> 16:25.640\n and bang into the atmosphere.\n\n16:25.640 --> 16:28.120\n And in these experiments,\n\n16:28.120 --> 16:29.840\n people start to see a whole load of new particles.\n\n16:29.840 --> 16:31.560\n So they discover for one thing antimatter,\n\n16:31.560 --> 16:34.440\n which is the sort of a mirror image of the particles.\n\n16:34.440 --> 16:35.960\n So we discovered that there's also,\n\n16:35.960 --> 16:37.440\n as well as a negatively charged electron,\n\n16:37.440 --> 16:38.520\n there's something called a positron,\n\n16:38.520 --> 16:40.480\n which is a positively charged version of the electron.\n\n16:40.480 --> 16:43.240\n And there's an antiproton, which is negatively charged.\n\n16:43.240 --> 16:45.600\n And then a whole load of other weird particles\n\n16:45.600 --> 16:46.480\n start to get discovered.\n\n16:46.480 --> 16:48.800\n And no one really knows what they are.\n\n16:48.800 --> 16:50.960\n This is known as the zoo of particles.\n\n16:50.960 --> 16:55.160\n Are these discoveries from the first theoretical discoveries\n\n16:55.160 --> 16:58.360\n or are they discoveries in an experiment?\n\n16:58.360 --> 17:01.120\n So like, yeah, what's the process of discovery\n\n17:01.120 --> 17:03.280\n for these early sets of particles?\n\n17:03.280 --> 17:04.120\n It's a mixture.\n\n17:04.120 --> 17:06.040\n The early stuff around the atom is really\n\n17:06.040 --> 17:07.200\n experimentally driven.\n\n17:07.200 --> 17:09.000\n It's not based on some theory.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.640\n It's exploration in the lab using equipment.\n\n17:11.640 --> 17:12.920\n So it's really people just figuring out,\n\n17:12.920 --> 17:14.400\n getting hands on with the phenomena,\n\n17:14.400 --> 17:16.000\n figuring out what these things are.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:17.600\n And the theory comes a bit later.\n\n17:17.600 --> 17:18.880\n That's not always the case.\n\n17:18.880 --> 17:22.480\n So in the discovery of the anti electron, the positron,\n\n17:22.480 --> 17:26.160\n that was predicted from quantum mechanics and relativity\n\n17:26.160 --> 17:30.320\n by a very clever theoretical physicist called Paul Dirac,\n\n17:30.320 --> 17:33.240\n who was probably the second brightest physicist\n\n17:33.240 --> 17:34.920\n of the 20th century, apart from Einstein,\n\n17:34.920 --> 17:36.720\n but isn't anywhere near as well known.\n\n17:36.720 --> 17:39.240\n So he predicted the existence of the anti electron\n\n17:39.240 --> 17:41.880\n from basically a combination of the theories\n\n17:41.880 --> 17:43.240\n of quantum mechanics and relativity.\n\n17:43.240 --> 17:44.720\n And it was discovered about a year after\n\n17:44.720 --> 17:46.000\n he made the prediction.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:49.160\n What happens when an electron meets a positron?\n\n17:49.160 --> 17:50.680\n They annihilate each other.\n\n17:50.680 --> 17:54.400\n So when you bring a particle and its antiparticle together,\n\n17:54.400 --> 17:56.440\n they react, well, they don't react,\n\n17:56.440 --> 17:58.520\n they just wipe each other out and they turn,\n\n17:58.520 --> 18:00.040\n their mass is turned into energy,\n\n18:00.040 --> 18:03.440\n usually in the form of photons, so you get light produced.\n\n18:03.440 --> 18:06.920\n So when you have that kind of situation,\n\n18:06.920 --> 18:08.880\n why does the universe exist at all\n\n18:08.880 --> 18:10.320\n if there's matter in any matter?\n\n18:10.320 --> 18:12.080\n Oh God, now we're getting into the really big questions.\n\n18:12.080 --> 18:15.680\n So, do you wanna go there now?\n\n18:15.680 --> 18:19.000\n Let's, maybe let's go there later.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:20.600\n Cause that, I mean, that is a very big question.\n\n18:20.600 --> 18:23.720\n Yeah, let's take it slow with the standard model.\n\n18:23.720 --> 18:28.240\n So, okay, so there's matter and antimatter in the 30s.\n\n18:28.240 --> 18:29.520\n So what else?\n\n18:29.520 --> 18:30.400\n So matter and antimatter,\n\n18:30.400 --> 18:33.400\n and then a load of new particles start turning up\n\n18:33.400 --> 18:36.880\n in these cosmic ray experiments, first of all.\n\n18:36.880 --> 18:40.120\n And they don't seem to be particles that make up atoms.\n\n18:40.120 --> 18:41.080\n They're something else.\n\n18:41.080 --> 18:44.120\n They all mostly interact with a strong nuclear force.\n\n18:44.120 --> 18:46.480\n So they're a bit like protons and neutrons.\n\n18:46.480 --> 18:50.280\n And by, in the 1960s in America, particularly,\n\n18:50.280 --> 18:52.320\n but also in Europe and Russia,\n\n18:52.320 --> 18:54.160\n scientists started to build particle accelerators.\n\n18:54.160 --> 18:55.800\n So these are the forerunners of the LHC.\n\n18:55.800 --> 18:58.280\n So big ring shaped machines that were, you know,\n\n18:58.280 --> 19:00.720\n hundreds of meters long, which in those days was enormous.\n\n19:00.720 --> 19:02.760\n You never, you know, most physics up until that point\n\n19:02.760 --> 19:04.840\n had been done in labs, in universities, you know,\n\n19:04.840 --> 19:06.240\n with small bits of kit.\n\n19:06.240 --> 19:07.160\n So this is a big change.\n\n19:07.160 --> 19:08.920\n And when these accelerators are built,\n\n19:08.920 --> 19:10.680\n they start to find they can produce\n\n19:10.680 --> 19:12.160\n even more of these particles.\n\n19:12.160 --> 19:16.440\n So I don't know the exact numbers, but by around 1960,\n\n19:16.440 --> 19:19.320\n there are of order a hundred of these things\n\n19:19.320 --> 19:20.160\n that have been discovered.\n\n19:20.160 --> 19:22.720\n And physicists are kind of tearing their hair out\n\n19:22.720 --> 19:25.040\n because physics is all about simplification.\n\n19:25.040 --> 19:28.080\n And suddenly what was simple has become messy\n\n19:28.080 --> 19:29.720\n and complicated and everyone sort of wants\n\n19:29.720 --> 19:31.640\n to understand what's going on.\n\n19:31.640 --> 19:34.600\n As a quick kind of aside and probably really dumb question,\n\n19:34.600 --> 19:38.720\n but how is it possible to take something like a,\n\n19:38.720 --> 19:43.720\n like a photon or electron and be able to control it enough,\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:49.000\n like to be able to do a controlled experiment\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.480\n where you collide it against something else?\n\n19:51.480 --> 19:52.320\n Yeah.\n\n19:52.320 --> 19:55.920\n Is that, is that, that seems like an exceptionally difficult\n\n19:55.920 --> 19:59.520\n engineering challenge because you mentioned vacuum too.\n\n19:59.520 --> 20:03.200\n So you basically want to remove every other distraction\n\n20:03.200 --> 20:04.760\n and really focus on this collision.\n\n20:04.760 --> 20:06.840\n How difficult of an engineering challenge is that?\n\n20:06.840 --> 20:07.840\n Just to get a sense.\n\n20:07.840 --> 20:09.680\n And it is very hard.\n\n20:09.680 --> 20:10.920\n I mean, in the early days,\n\n20:10.920 --> 20:12.960\n particularly when the first accelerators are being built\n\n20:12.960 --> 20:17.880\n in like 1932, Ernest Lawrence builds the first,\n\n20:17.880 --> 20:18.880\n what we call a cyclotron,\n\n20:18.880 --> 20:21.760\n which is like a little accelerator, this big or so.\n\n20:21.760 --> 20:22.600\n There's another one.\n\n20:22.600 --> 20:23.420\n Is it really that big?\n\n20:23.420 --> 20:24.260\n There's a tiny little thing.\n\n20:24.260 --> 20:25.100\n Yeah.\n\n20:25.100 --> 20:27.840\n So most of the first accelerators\n\n20:27.840 --> 20:31.000\n were what we call fixed target experiments.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:34.100\n So you had a ring, you accelerate particles around the ring\n\n20:34.100 --> 20:37.480\n and then you fire them out the side into some target.\n\n20:37.480 --> 20:39.480\n So that makes the kind of,\n\n20:39.480 --> 20:41.320\n the colliding bit is relatively straightforward\n\n20:41.320 --> 20:42.360\n because you just fire it,\n\n20:42.360 --> 20:43.660\n whatever it is you want to fire it at.\n\n20:43.660 --> 20:46.200\n The hard bit is the steering the beams\n\n20:46.200 --> 20:47.760\n with the magnetic fields, getting, you know,\n\n20:47.760 --> 20:49.560\n strong enough electric fields to accelerate them,\n\n20:49.560 --> 20:50.400\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n20:50.400 --> 20:53.760\n The first colliders where you have two beams\n\n20:53.760 --> 20:56.680\n colliding head on, that comes later.\n\n20:56.680 --> 21:01.680\n And I don't think it's done until maybe the 1980s.\n\n21:01.920 --> 21:05.360\n I'm not entirely sure, but it's a much harder problem.\n\n21:05.360 --> 21:06.200\n That's crazy.\n\n21:06.200 --> 21:09.880\n Cause you have to like perfectly get them to hit each other.\n\n21:09.880 --> 21:13.120\n I mean, we're talking about, I mean, what scale it takes,\n\n21:13.120 --> 21:18.120\n what's the, I mean, the temporal thing is a giant mess,\n\n21:18.160 --> 21:23.160\n but the spatially, like the size is tiny.\n\n21:23.160 --> 21:26.060\n Well, to give you a sense of the LHC beams,\n\n21:26.060 --> 21:31.060\n the cross sectional diameter is I think around a dozen\n\n21:31.620 --> 21:32.820\n or so microns.\n\n21:32.820 --> 21:37.060\n So, you know, 10 millionths of a meter.\n\n21:37.060 --> 21:39.900\n And a beam, sorry, just to clarify,\n\n21:39.900 --> 21:41.340\n a beam contains how many,\n\n21:41.340 --> 21:43.060\n is it the bunches that you mentioned?\n\n21:43.060 --> 21:45.060\n Is it multiple particles or is it just one particle?\n\n21:45.060 --> 21:45.900\n Oh no, no.\n\n21:45.900 --> 21:48.920\n The bunches contains say a hundred billion protons each.\n\n21:48.920 --> 21:51.020\n So a bunch is, it's not really bunch shaped.\n\n21:51.020 --> 21:51.900\n They're actually quite long.\n\n21:51.900 --> 21:53.660\n They're like 30 centimeters long,\n\n21:53.660 --> 21:54.860\n but thinner than a human hair.\n\n21:54.860 --> 21:58.420\n So like very, very narrow, long sort of objects.\n\n21:58.420 --> 21:59.260\n Those are the things.\n\n21:59.260 --> 22:02.260\n So what happens in the LHC is you steer the beams\n\n22:02.260 --> 22:06.080\n so that they cross in the middle of the detector.\n\n22:06.080 --> 22:08.540\n So they basically have these swarms of protons\n\n22:08.540 --> 22:10.160\n that are flying through each other.\n\n22:10.160 --> 22:12.180\n And most of the, you have to have a hundred billion\n\n22:12.180 --> 22:14.500\n coming one way, a hundred billion another way,\n\n22:14.500 --> 22:17.100\n maybe 10 of them will hit each other.\n\n22:17.100 --> 22:17.940\n Oh, okay.\n\n22:17.940 --> 22:19.400\n So this, okay, that makes a lot more sense.\n\n22:19.400 --> 22:20.240\n So that's nice.\n\n22:20.240 --> 22:21.980\n But you're trying to use sort of,\n\n22:21.980 --> 22:24.560\n it's like probabilistically, you're not.\n\n22:24.560 --> 22:26.100\n You can't make a single particle collide\n\n22:26.100 --> 22:26.940\n with a single other particle.\n\n22:26.940 --> 22:28.140\n That's not an efficient way to do it.\n\n22:28.140 --> 22:30.980\n You'd be waiting a very long time to get anything.\n\n22:30.980 --> 22:34.020\n So you're basically, right.\n\n22:34.020 --> 22:37.460\n You're relying on probability to be that some fraction\n\n22:37.460 --> 22:38.780\n of them are gonna collide.\n\n22:38.780 --> 22:40.820\n And then you know which,\n\n22:40.820 --> 22:44.340\n because it's a swarm of the same kind of particle.\n\n22:44.340 --> 22:46.420\n So it doesn't matter which ones hit each other exactly.\n\n22:46.420 --> 22:48.240\n I mean, that's not to say it's not hard.\n\n22:48.240 --> 22:50.420\n You've got to, one of the challenges\n\n22:50.420 --> 22:52.880\n to make the collisions work is you have to squash\n\n22:52.880 --> 22:54.580\n these beams to very, very,\n\n22:54.580 --> 22:56.020\n basically the narrower they are the better\n\n22:56.020 --> 22:58.780\n cause the higher chances of them colliding.\n\n22:58.780 --> 23:00.380\n If you think about two flocks of birds\n\n23:00.380 --> 23:01.580\n flying through each other,\n\n23:01.580 --> 23:03.660\n the birds are all far apart in the flocks.\n\n23:03.660 --> 23:04.980\n There's not much chance that they'll collide.\n\n23:04.980 --> 23:06.420\n If they're all flying densely together,\n\n23:06.420 --> 23:08.360\n then they're much more likely to collide with each other.\n\n23:08.360 --> 23:10.060\n So that's the sort of problem.\n\n23:10.060 --> 23:12.060\n And it's tuning those magnetic fields,\n\n23:12.060 --> 23:13.380\n getting the magnetic fields powerful enough\n\n23:13.380 --> 23:15.220\n that you squash the beams and focus them\n\n23:15.220 --> 23:16.900\n so that you get enough collisions.\n\n23:16.900 --> 23:17.900\n That's super cool.\n\n23:17.900 --> 23:20.360\n Do you know how much software is involved here?\n\n23:20.360 --> 23:21.200\n I mean, it's sort of,\n\n23:21.200 --> 23:23.600\n I come from the software world and it's fascinating.\n\n23:24.780 --> 23:28.060\n This seems like software is buggy and messy.\n\n23:28.060 --> 23:30.980\n And so like, you almost don't want to rely\n\n23:30.980 --> 23:31.900\n on software too much.\n\n23:31.900 --> 23:33.900\n Like if you do, it has to be like low level,\n\n23:33.900 --> 23:36.340\n like Fortran style programming.\n\n23:36.340 --> 23:37.540\n Do you know how much software\n\n23:37.540 --> 23:39.500\n is in a large Hadron Collider?\n\n23:39.500 --> 23:41.580\n I mean, it depends at which level a lot.\n\n23:41.580 --> 23:43.640\n I mean, the whole thing is obviously computer controlled.\n\n23:43.640 --> 23:45.460\n So, I mean, I don't know a huge amount\n\n23:45.460 --> 23:49.340\n about how the software for the actual accelerator works,\n\n23:49.340 --> 23:51.340\n but I've been in the control center.\n\n23:51.340 --> 23:53.280\n So at CERN, there's this big control room,\n\n23:53.280 --> 23:55.480\n which is like a bit like a NASA mission control\n\n23:55.480 --> 23:57.760\n with big banks of desks where the engineers sit\n\n23:57.760 --> 23:59.180\n and they monitor the LHC.\n\n23:59.180 --> 24:00.860\n Cause you obviously can't be in the tunnel\n\n24:00.860 --> 24:01.680\n when it's running.\n\n24:01.680 --> 24:03.460\n So everything's remote.\n\n24:03.460 --> 24:07.460\n I mean, one sort of anecdote about the software side,\n\n24:07.460 --> 24:10.460\n in 2008, when the LHC first switched on,\n\n24:10.460 --> 24:11.620\n they had this big launch event\n\n24:11.620 --> 24:14.940\n and then big press conference party\n\n24:14.940 --> 24:16.260\n to inaugurate the machine.\n\n24:16.260 --> 24:18.300\n And about 10 days after that,\n\n24:18.300 --> 24:19.580\n they were doing some tests\n\n24:19.580 --> 24:22.100\n and this dramatic event happened\n\n24:22.100 --> 24:24.180\n where a huge explosion basically took place\n\n24:24.180 --> 24:26.880\n in the tunnel that destroyed or damaged, badly damaged\n\n24:26.880 --> 24:29.880\n about half a kilometer of the machine.\n\n24:29.880 --> 24:31.540\n But the stories, the engineers\n\n24:31.540 --> 24:33.620\n are in the control room that day.\n\n24:33.620 --> 24:35.300\n One guy told me this story about,\n\n24:35.300 --> 24:37.700\n basically all these screens they have in the control room\n\n24:37.700 --> 24:38.540\n started going red.\n\n24:38.540 --> 24:42.300\n So these alarms like kind of in software going off\n\n24:42.300 --> 24:43.500\n and then they assume that there's something wrong\n\n24:43.500 --> 24:45.500\n with the software, cause there's no way\n\n24:45.500 --> 24:48.700\n something this catastrophic could have happened.\n\n24:48.700 --> 24:52.300\n But I mean, when I worked on, when I was a PhD student,\n\n24:52.300 --> 24:56.060\n one of my jobs was to help to maintain the software\n\n24:56.060 --> 24:59.140\n that's used to control the detector that we work on.\n\n24:59.140 --> 25:01.180\n And that was, it's relatively robust,\n\n25:01.180 --> 25:02.940\n not such, you don't want it to be too fancy.\n\n25:02.940 --> 25:04.620\n You don't want it to sort of fall over too easily.\n\n25:04.620 --> 25:07.040\n The more clever stuff comes\n\n25:07.040 --> 25:08.500\n when you're talking about analyzing the data\n\n25:08.500 --> 25:10.540\n and that's where the sort of, you know.\n\n25:10.540 --> 25:11.740\n Are we jumping around too much?\n\n25:11.740 --> 25:13.160\n Do we finish with a standard model?\n\n25:13.160 --> 25:14.000\n We didn't, no.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:17.020\n We didn't, so have we even started talking about quarks?\n\n25:17.020 --> 25:17.860\n We haven't talked to them yet.\n\n25:17.860 --> 25:20.360\n No, we got to the messy zoo of particles.\n\n25:20.360 --> 25:22.980\n Let me, let's go back there if it's okay.\n\n25:22.980 --> 25:23.820\n Okay, that's fine.\n\n25:23.820 --> 25:26.540\n Can you take us to the rest of the history of physics\n\n25:26.540 --> 25:27.700\n in the 20th century?\n\n25:27.700 --> 25:29.020\n Okay, sure.\n\n25:29.020 --> 25:32.000\n Okay, so circa 1960, you have this,\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.680\n you have these a hundred or so particles.\n\n25:33.680 --> 25:35.540\n It's a bit like the periodic table all over again.\n\n25:35.540 --> 25:37.860\n So you've got like having a hundred elements,\n\n25:37.860 --> 25:39.260\n it's sort of a bit like that.\n\n25:39.260 --> 25:41.500\n And people start to try to impose some order.\n\n25:41.500 --> 25:46.140\n So Murray Gellman, he's a theoretical physicist,\n\n25:46.140 --> 25:47.700\n American from New York.\n\n25:47.700 --> 25:50.500\n He realizes that there are these symmetries\n\n25:50.500 --> 25:53.340\n in these particles that if you arrange them in certain ways,\n\n25:53.340 --> 25:54.380\n they relate to each other.\n\n25:54.380 --> 25:56.060\n And he uses these symmetry principles\n\n25:56.060 --> 25:58.260\n to predict the existence of particles\n\n25:58.260 --> 25:59.220\n that haven't been discovered,\n\n25:59.220 --> 26:01.060\n which are then discovered in accelerators.\n\n26:01.060 --> 26:02.480\n So this starts to suggest\n\n26:02.480 --> 26:04.500\n there's not just random collections of crap.\n\n26:04.500 --> 26:06.460\n There's like, you know, actually some order\n\n26:06.460 --> 26:08.740\n to this underlying it.\n\n26:08.740 --> 26:13.280\n A little bit later in 1960, again, around the 1960s,\n\n26:14.260 --> 26:17.860\n he proposes along with another physicist called George Zweig\n\n26:17.860 --> 26:21.060\n that these symmetries arise because\n\n26:21.060 --> 26:23.380\n just like the patterns in the periodic table arise\n\n26:23.380 --> 26:26.420\n because atoms are made of electrons and protons,\n\n26:26.420 --> 26:28.100\n that these patterns are due to the fact\n\n26:28.100 --> 26:30.260\n that these particles are made of smaller things.\n\n26:30.260 --> 26:31.900\n And they are called quarks.\n\n26:31.900 --> 26:34.500\n So these are the particles they're predicted from theory.\n\n26:34.500 --> 26:36.700\n For a long time, no one really believes they're real.\n\n26:36.700 --> 26:39.180\n A lot of people think that they're a kind of theoretical\n\n26:39.180 --> 26:41.480\n convenience that happened to fit the data,\n\n26:41.480 --> 26:42.580\n but there's no evidence.\n\n26:42.580 --> 26:45.460\n No one's ever seen a quark in any experiment.\n\n26:45.460 --> 26:48.580\n And lots of experiments are done to try to find quarks,\n\n26:48.580 --> 26:50.460\n to try to knock a quark out of a...\n\n26:50.460 --> 26:52.860\n So the idea, if protons and neutrons are made of quarks,\n\n26:52.860 --> 26:55.140\n you should be able to knock a quark out and see the quark.\n\n26:55.140 --> 26:56.020\n That never happens.\n\n26:56.020 --> 26:58.140\n And we still have never actually managed to do that.\n\n26:58.140 --> 26:59.260\n Wait, really?\n\n26:59.260 --> 27:00.100\n No.\n\n27:00.100 --> 27:02.260\n So the way that it's done in the end\n\n27:02.260 --> 27:04.620\n is this machine that's built in California\n\n27:04.620 --> 27:08.860\n at the Stanford Lab, Stanford Linear Accelerator,\n\n27:08.860 --> 27:10.540\n which is essentially a gigantic,\n\n27:10.540 --> 27:12.460\n three kilometer long electron gun.\n\n27:12.460 --> 27:16.260\n It fires electrons, almost the speed of light, at protons.\n\n27:16.260 --> 27:17.860\n And when you do these experiments,\n\n27:17.860 --> 27:20.100\n what you find is at very high energy,\n\n27:20.100 --> 27:24.000\n the electrons bounce off small, hard objects\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:25.420\n inside the proton.\n\n27:25.420 --> 27:28.100\n So it's a bit like taking an X ray of the proton.\n\n27:28.100 --> 27:31.580\n You're firing these very light, high energy particles,\n\n27:31.580 --> 27:34.260\n and they're pinging off little things inside the proton\n\n27:34.260 --> 27:36.260\n that are like ball bearings, if you like.\n\n27:36.260 --> 27:38.220\n So you actually, that way,\n\n27:38.220 --> 27:41.020\n they resolve that there are three things\n\n27:41.020 --> 27:42.820\n inside the proton, which are quarks,\n\n27:42.820 --> 27:45.480\n the quarks that Gellman and Zweig had predicted.\n\n27:45.480 --> 27:47.900\n So that's really the evidence that convinces people\n\n27:47.900 --> 27:49.400\n that these things are real.\n\n27:49.400 --> 27:50.820\n The fact that we've never seen one\n\n27:50.820 --> 27:51.980\n in an experiment directly,\n\n27:51.980 --> 27:56.260\n they're always stuck inside other particles.\n\n27:56.260 --> 27:58.180\n And the reason for that is essentially\n\n27:58.180 --> 27:59.100\n to do with a strong force.\n\n27:59.100 --> 28:01.700\n The strong force is the force that holds quarks together.\n\n28:01.700 --> 28:04.020\n And it's so strong that it's impossible\n\n28:04.020 --> 28:06.460\n to actually liberate a quark.\n\n28:06.460 --> 28:08.260\n So if you try and pull a quark out of a proton,\n\n28:08.260 --> 28:09.700\n what actually ends up happening\n\n28:09.700 --> 28:14.260\n is that you kind of create this spring like bond\n\n28:14.260 --> 28:15.100\n in the strong force.\n\n28:15.100 --> 28:16.780\n You imagine two quarks that are held together\n\n28:16.780 --> 28:18.540\n by a very powerful spring.\n\n28:18.540 --> 28:19.940\n You pull and pull and pull,\n\n28:19.940 --> 28:22.280\n more and more energy gets stored in that bond,\n\n28:22.280 --> 28:23.420\n like stretching a spring,\n\n28:23.420 --> 28:25.340\n and eventually the tension gets so great,\n\n28:25.340 --> 28:28.700\n the spring snaps, and the energy in that bond\n\n28:28.700 --> 28:30.660\n gets turned into two new quarks\n\n28:30.660 --> 28:32.420\n that go on the broken ends.\n\n28:32.420 --> 28:33.260\n So you started with two quarks,\n\n28:33.260 --> 28:34.660\n you end up with four quarks.\n\n28:34.660 --> 28:37.180\n So you never actually get to take a quark out.\n\n28:37.180 --> 28:39.860\n You just end up making loads more quarks in the process.\n\n28:39.860 --> 28:42.900\n So how do we, again, forgive the dumb question,\n\n28:42.900 --> 28:44.880\n how do we know quarks are real then?\n\n28:44.880 --> 28:48.100\n Well, A, from these experiments where we can scatter,\n\n28:48.100 --> 28:49.700\n you fire electrons into the protons.\n\n28:49.700 --> 28:52.620\n They can burrow into the proton and knock off,\n\n28:52.620 --> 28:55.140\n and they can bounce off these quarks.\n\n28:55.140 --> 28:56.460\n So you can see from the angles,\n\n28:56.460 --> 28:58.100\n the electrons come out.\n\n28:58.100 --> 28:59.120\n I see, you can infer.\n\n28:59.120 --> 29:02.060\n You can infer that these things are there.\n\n29:02.060 --> 29:03.620\n The quark model can also be used.\n\n29:03.620 --> 29:05.340\n It has a lot of successes that you can use it\n\n29:05.340 --> 29:07.500\n to predict the existence of new particles\n\n29:07.500 --> 29:08.700\n that hadn't been seen.\n\n29:08.700 --> 29:10.780\n So, and it basically, there's lots of data\n\n29:10.780 --> 29:12.340\n basically showing from, you know,\n\n29:12.340 --> 29:15.200\n when we fire protons at each other at the LHC,\n\n29:16.420 --> 29:18.820\n a lot of quarks get knocked all over the place.\n\n29:18.820 --> 29:20.540\n And every time they try and escape from,\n\n29:20.540 --> 29:21.580\n say, one of their protons,\n\n29:21.580 --> 29:25.580\n they make a whole jet of quarks that go flying off,\n\n29:25.580 --> 29:28.560\n bound up in other sorts of particles made of quarks.\n\n29:28.560 --> 29:30.740\n So all the sort of the theoretical predictions\n\n29:30.740 --> 29:33.740\n from the basic theory of the strong force and the quarks\n\n29:33.740 --> 29:35.380\n all agrees with what we are seeing in experiments.\n\n29:35.380 --> 29:38.020\n We've just never seen an actual quark on its own\n\n29:38.020 --> 29:39.280\n because unfortunately it's impossible\n\n29:39.280 --> 29:41.140\n to get them out on their own.\n\n29:41.140 --> 29:45.120\n So quarks, these crazy smaller things\n\n29:45.120 --> 29:47.160\n that are hard to imagine are real.\n\n29:47.160 --> 29:48.140\n So what else?\n\n29:48.140 --> 29:49.780\n What else is part of the story here?\n\n29:49.780 --> 29:52.100\n So the other thing that's going on at the time,\n\n29:52.100 --> 29:57.100\n around the 60s, is an attempt to understand the forces\n\n29:57.380 --> 30:00.220\n that make these particles interact with each other.\n\n30:00.220 --> 30:01.780\n So you have the electromagnetic force,\n\n30:01.780 --> 30:03.900\n which is the force that was sort of discovered\n\n30:03.900 --> 30:07.140\n to some extent in this room, or at least in this building.\n\n30:07.140 --> 30:10.020\n So the first, what we call quantum field theory\n\n30:10.020 --> 30:13.380\n of the electromagnetic force is developed\n\n30:13.380 --> 30:17.660\n in the 1940s and 50s by Feynman,\n\n30:17.660 --> 30:19.740\n Richard Feynman amongst other people,\n\n30:19.740 --> 30:22.020\n Julian Schrodinger, Tom Onaga,\n\n30:22.020 --> 30:23.060\n who come up with the first,\n\n30:23.060 --> 30:24.420\n what we call a quantum field theory\n\n30:24.420 --> 30:25.740\n of the electromagnetic force.\n\n30:25.740 --> 30:27.340\n And this is where this description of,\n\n30:27.340 --> 30:28.360\n which I gave you at the beginning,\n\n30:28.360 --> 30:30.820\n that particles are ripples in fields.\n\n30:30.820 --> 30:33.900\n Well, in this theory, the photon, the particle of light\n\n30:33.900 --> 30:36.340\n is described as a ripple in this quantum field\n\n30:36.340 --> 30:38.720\n called the electromagnetic field.\n\n30:38.720 --> 30:40.240\n And the attempt then is made to try,\n\n30:40.240 --> 30:42.260\n well, can we come up with a quantum field theory\n\n30:42.260 --> 30:45.140\n of the other forces, of the strong force and the weak,\n\n30:45.140 --> 30:47.140\n the third force, which we haven't discussed,\n\n30:47.140 --> 30:50.740\n which is the weak force, which is a nuclear force.\n\n30:50.740 --> 30:52.640\n We don't really experience it in our everyday lives,\n\n30:52.640 --> 30:54.960\n but it's responsible for radioactive decay.\n\n30:54.960 --> 30:56.980\n It's the force that allows, you know,\n\n30:56.980 --> 30:59.140\n on a radioactive atom to turn\n\n30:59.140 --> 31:01.060\n into a different element, for example.\n\n31:01.060 --> 31:03.420\n And I don't know if you've explicitly mentioned,\n\n31:03.420 --> 31:06.100\n but so there's technically four forces.\n\n31:06.100 --> 31:06.980\n Yes.\n\n31:06.980 --> 31:09.900\n I guess three of them would be in the standard model,\n\n31:09.900 --> 31:13.460\n like the weak, the strong, and the electromagnetic,\n\n31:13.460 --> 31:14.540\n and then there's gravity.\n\n31:14.540 --> 31:16.220\n And there's gravity, which we don't worry about that,\n\n31:16.220 --> 31:17.040\n because it's too hard.\n\n31:17.040 --> 31:17.880\n It's too hard.\n\n31:17.880 --> 31:19.940\n Well, no, maybe we bring that up at the end, but yeah.\n\n31:19.940 --> 31:22.340\n Gravity, so far, we don't have a quantum theory of,\n\n31:22.340 --> 31:23.580\n and if you can solve that problem,\n\n31:23.580 --> 31:25.140\n you'll win a Nobel Prize.\n\n31:25.140 --> 31:26.340\n Well, we're gonna have to bring up\n\n31:26.340 --> 31:28.140\n the graviton at some point, I'm gonna ask you,\n\n31:28.140 --> 31:31.160\n but let's leave that to the side for now.\n\n31:31.160 --> 31:36.160\n So those three, okay, Feynman, electromagnetic force,\n\n31:36.500 --> 31:41.500\n the quantum field, and where does the weak force come in?\n\n31:41.920 --> 31:43.580\n So yeah, well, first of all,\n\n31:43.580 --> 31:44.780\n I mean, the strong force is the easiest.\n\n31:44.780 --> 31:46.460\n The strong force is a little bit\n\n31:46.460 --> 31:47.600\n like the electromagnetic force.\n\n31:47.600 --> 31:49.140\n It's a force that binds things together.\n\n31:49.140 --> 31:51.060\n So that's the force that holds quarks together\n\n31:51.060 --> 31:52.860\n inside the proton, for example.\n\n31:52.860 --> 31:55.960\n So a quantum field theory of that force\n\n31:55.960 --> 31:58.900\n is discovered in the, I think it's in the 60s,\n\n31:59.820 --> 32:01.460\n and it predicts the existence\n\n32:01.460 --> 32:04.500\n of new force particles called gluons.\n\n32:04.500 --> 32:06.940\n So gluons are a bit like the photon.\n\n32:06.940 --> 32:09.500\n The photon is the particle of electromagnetism.\n\n32:09.500 --> 32:13.540\n Gluons are the particles of the strong force.\n\n32:13.540 --> 32:15.860\n So just like there's an electromagnetic field,\n\n32:15.860 --> 32:17.540\n there's something called a gluon field,\n\n32:17.540 --> 32:19.500\n which is also all around us.\n\n32:19.500 --> 32:21.780\n So some of these particles, I guess,\n\n32:21.780 --> 32:23.660\n are the force carriers or whatever.\n\n32:23.660 --> 32:24.500\n They carry the force.\n\n32:24.500 --> 32:25.980\n It depends how you want to think about it.\n\n32:25.980 --> 32:28.460\n I mean, really the field, the strong force field,\n\n32:28.460 --> 32:32.880\n the gluon field is the thing that binds the quarks together.\n\n32:32.880 --> 32:35.460\n The gluons are the little ripples in that field.\n\n32:35.460 --> 32:37.740\n So that like, in the same way that the photon is a ripple\n\n32:37.740 --> 32:39.900\n in the electromagnetic field.\n\n32:39.900 --> 32:43.620\n But the thing that really does the binding is the field.\n\n32:43.620 --> 32:45.680\n I mean, you may have heard people talk about things\n\n32:45.680 --> 32:48.600\n like you've heard the phrase virtual particle.\n\n32:49.860 --> 32:52.460\n So sometimes in some, if you hear people describing\n\n32:52.460 --> 32:54.900\n how forces are exchanged between particles,\n\n32:54.900 --> 32:56.220\n they quite often talk about the idea\n\n32:56.220 --> 32:59.180\n that if you have an electron and another electron, say,\n\n32:59.180 --> 33:00.640\n and they're repelling each other\n\n33:00.640 --> 33:03.060\n through the electromagnetic force,\n\n33:03.060 --> 33:05.820\n you can think of that as if they're exchanging photons.\n\n33:05.820 --> 33:07.060\n So they're kind of firing photons\n\n33:07.060 --> 33:08.660\n backwards and forwards between each other.\n\n33:08.660 --> 33:11.060\n And that causes them to repel.\n\n33:11.060 --> 33:13.060\n That photon is then a virtual particle.\n\n33:13.060 --> 33:14.460\n Yes, that's what we call a virtual particle.\n\n33:14.460 --> 33:15.580\n In other words, it's not a real thing,\n\n33:15.580 --> 33:16.820\n it doesn't actually exist.\n\n33:16.820 --> 33:19.900\n So it's an artifact of the way theorists do calculations.\n\n33:19.900 --> 33:22.140\n So when they do calculations in quantum field theory,\n\n33:22.140 --> 33:24.460\n rather than, no one's discovered a way\n\n33:24.460 --> 33:25.780\n of just treating the whole field.\n\n33:25.780 --> 33:28.200\n You have to break the field down into simpler things.\n\n33:28.200 --> 33:30.200\n So you can basically treat the field\n\n33:30.200 --> 33:33.540\n as if it's made up of lots of these virtual photons,\n\n33:33.540 --> 33:35.660\n but there's no experiment that you can do\n\n33:35.660 --> 33:38.420\n that can detect these particles being exchanged.\n\n33:38.420 --> 33:40.460\n What's really happening in reality\n\n33:40.460 --> 33:43.280\n is that the electromagnetic field is warped\n\n33:43.280 --> 33:46.240\n by the charge of the electron and that causes the force.\n\n33:46.240 --> 33:49.300\n But the way we do calculations involves particles.\n\n33:49.300 --> 33:50.840\n So it's a bit confusing,\n\n33:50.840 --> 33:53.300\n but it's really a mathematical technique.\n\n33:53.300 --> 33:55.740\n It's not something that corresponds to reality.\n\n33:55.740 --> 33:58.260\n I mean, that's part, I guess, of the Feynman diagrams.\n\n33:58.260 --> 33:59.100\n Yes.\n\n33:59.100 --> 34:00.100\n Is this these virtual particles, okay.\n\n34:00.100 --> 34:01.500\n That's right, yeah.\n\n34:01.500 --> 34:03.800\n Some of these have mass, some of them don't.\n\n34:06.380 --> 34:09.060\n What does that even mean, not to have mass?\n\n34:09.060 --> 34:11.900\n And maybe you can say which one of them have mass\n\n34:11.900 --> 34:12.860\n and which don't.\n\n34:12.860 --> 34:14.140\n Okay, so.\n\n34:14.140 --> 34:17.020\n And why is mass important or relevant\n\n34:17.020 --> 34:22.020\n in this field view of the universe?\n\n34:22.020 --> 34:23.700\n Well, there are actually only two particles\n\n34:23.700 --> 34:25.500\n in the standard model that don't have mass,\n\n34:25.500 --> 34:28.480\n which are the photon and the gluons.\n\n34:28.480 --> 34:30.300\n So they are massless particles,\n\n34:30.300 --> 34:32.960\n but the electron, the quarks,\n\n34:32.960 --> 34:34.140\n and there are a bunch of other particles\n\n34:34.140 --> 34:34.960\n I haven't discussed.\n\n34:34.960 --> 34:36.380\n There's something called a muon and a tau,\n\n34:36.380 --> 34:39.280\n which are basically heavy versions of the electron\n\n34:39.280 --> 34:40.120\n that are unstable.\n\n34:40.120 --> 34:41.380\n You can make them in accelerators,\n\n34:41.380 --> 34:44.200\n but they don't form atoms or anything.\n\n34:44.200 --> 34:45.600\n They don't exist for long enough.\n\n34:45.600 --> 34:48.700\n But all the matter particles, there are 12 of them,\n\n34:48.700 --> 34:51.940\n six quarks and six, what we call leptons,\n\n34:51.940 --> 34:54.460\n which includes the electron and its two heavy versions\n\n34:54.460 --> 34:57.380\n and three neutrinos, all of them have mass.\n\n34:57.380 --> 34:59.500\n And so do, this is the critical bit.\n\n34:59.500 --> 35:02.860\n So the weak force, which is the third of these\n\n35:02.860 --> 35:06.240\n quantum forces, which is one of the hardest to understand,\n\n35:07.540 --> 35:12.540\n the force particles of that force have very large masses.\n\n35:13.860 --> 35:14.900\n And there are three of them.\n\n35:14.900 --> 35:19.540\n They're called the W plus, the W minus, and the Z boson.\n\n35:19.540 --> 35:23.000\n And they have masses of between 80 and 90 times\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:24.580\n that of the protons.\n\n35:24.580 --> 35:25.660\n They're very heavy.\n\n35:25.660 --> 35:26.500\n Wow.\n\n35:26.500 --> 35:27.320\n They're very heavy things.\n\n35:27.320 --> 35:29.440\n So they're what, the heaviest, I guess?\n\n35:29.440 --> 35:30.280\n They're not the heaviest.\n\n35:30.280 --> 35:32.920\n The heaviest particle is the top quark,\n\n35:32.920 --> 35:37.920\n which has a mass of about 175 ish protons.\n\n35:38.460 --> 35:39.700\n So that's really massive.\n\n35:39.700 --> 35:41.680\n And we don't know why it's so massive,\n\n35:41.680 --> 35:43.160\n but coming back to the weak force,\n\n35:43.160 --> 35:47.380\n so the problem in the 60s and 70s was that\n\n35:47.380 --> 35:50.100\n the reason that the electromagnetic force\n\n35:50.100 --> 35:51.900\n is a force that we can experience in our everyday lives.\n\n35:51.900 --> 35:53.260\n So if we have a magnet and a piece of metal,\n\n35:53.260 --> 35:55.420\n you can hold it, you know, a meter apart\n\n35:55.420 --> 35:57.040\n if it's powerful enough and you'll feel a force.\n\n35:57.040 --> 36:00.380\n Whereas the weak force only becomes apparent\n\n36:00.380 --> 36:03.180\n when you basically have two particles touching\n\n36:03.180 --> 36:05.340\n at the scale of a nucleus.\n\n36:05.340 --> 36:06.980\n So we just get to very short distances\n\n36:06.980 --> 36:09.620\n before this force becomes manifest.\n\n36:09.620 --> 36:12.260\n It's not, we don't get weak forces going on in this room.\n\n36:12.260 --> 36:14.060\n We don't notice them.\n\n36:14.060 --> 36:15.860\n And the reason for that is that the particle,\n\n36:15.860 --> 36:20.140\n well, the field that transmits the weak force,\n\n36:20.140 --> 36:22.300\n the particle that's associated with that field\n\n36:22.300 --> 36:23.380\n has a very large mass,\n\n36:23.380 --> 36:26.240\n which means that the field dies off very quickly.\n\n36:26.240 --> 36:28.360\n So as you, whereas an electric charge,\n\n36:28.360 --> 36:30.640\n if you were to look at the shape of the electromagnetic field,\n\n36:30.640 --> 36:32.140\n it would fall off with this,\n\n36:32.140 --> 36:33.780\n you have this thing called the inverse square law,\n\n36:33.780 --> 36:36.220\n which is the idea that the force halves\n\n36:36.220 --> 36:38.740\n every time you double the distance.\n\n36:38.740 --> 36:39.700\n No, sorry, it doesn't half.\n\n36:39.700 --> 36:42.580\n It quarters every time you double the distance\n\n36:42.580 --> 36:44.220\n between say the two particles.\n\n36:44.220 --> 36:45.780\n Whereas the weak force kind of,\n\n36:45.780 --> 36:47.300\n you move a little bit away from the nucleus\n\n36:47.300 --> 36:49.400\n and just disappears.\n\n36:49.400 --> 36:51.980\n The reason for that is because these fields,\n\n36:51.980 --> 36:55.420\n the particles that go with them have a very large mass.\n\n36:55.420 --> 36:59.860\n But the problem that theorists faced in the 60s\n\n36:59.860 --> 37:04.300\n was that if you tried to introduce massive force fields,\n\n37:04.300 --> 37:06.540\n the theory gave you nonsensical answers.\n\n37:06.540 --> 37:08.700\n So you'd end up with infinite results\n\n37:08.700 --> 37:11.140\n for a lot of the calculations you tried to do.\n\n37:11.140 --> 37:13.660\n So the basically, it seemed that quantum field theory\n\n37:13.660 --> 37:17.320\n was incompatible with having massive particles,\n\n37:17.320 --> 37:18.700\n not just the force particles actually,\n\n37:18.700 --> 37:21.900\n but even the electron was a problem.\n\n37:21.900 --> 37:23.740\n So this is where the Higgs\n\n37:23.740 --> 37:25.640\n that we sort of alluded to comes in.\n\n37:25.640 --> 37:28.400\n And the solution was to say, okay, well,\n\n37:28.400 --> 37:30.460\n actually all the particles in the Standard Model are mass.\n\n37:30.460 --> 37:31.540\n They have no mass.\n\n37:31.540 --> 37:33.340\n So the quarks, the electron, they don't have a mass.\n\n37:33.340 --> 37:34.820\n Neither do these weak particles.\n\n37:34.820 --> 37:36.740\n They don't have mass either.\n\n37:36.740 --> 37:38.500\n What happens is they actually acquire mass\n\n37:38.500 --> 37:40.420\n through another process.\n\n37:40.420 --> 37:41.660\n They get it from somewhere else.\n\n37:41.660 --> 37:43.780\n They don't actually have it intrinsically.\n\n37:43.780 --> 37:46.500\n So this idea that was introduced by,\n\n37:46.500 --> 37:47.740\n well, Peter Higgs is the most famous,\n\n37:47.740 --> 37:49.380\n but actually there are about six people\n\n37:49.380 --> 37:52.080\n that came up with the idea more or less at the same time,\n\n37:52.080 --> 37:55.180\n is that you introduce a new quantum field,\n\n37:55.180 --> 37:56.880\n which is another one of these invisible things\n\n37:56.880 --> 37:58.100\n that's everywhere.\n\n37:58.100 --> 38:01.500\n And it's through the interaction with this field\n\n38:01.500 --> 38:02.660\n that particles get mass.\n\n38:02.660 --> 38:07.380\n So you can think of say an electron in the Higgs field,\n\n38:07.380 --> 38:10.900\n the Higgs field kind of bunches around the electron.\n\n38:10.900 --> 38:12.900\n It's sort of drawn towards the electron.\n\n38:12.900 --> 38:15.580\n And that energy that's stored in that field\n\n38:15.580 --> 38:17.720\n around the electron is what we see\n\n38:17.720 --> 38:19.320\n as the mass of the electron.\n\n38:19.320 --> 38:21.740\n But if you could somehow turn off the Higgs field,\n\n38:21.740 --> 38:23.880\n then all the particles in nature would become massless\n\n38:23.880 --> 38:26.540\n and fly around at the speed of light.\n\n38:26.540 --> 38:31.540\n So this idea of the Higgs field allowed other people,\n\n38:32.540 --> 38:36.160\n other theorists to come up with a, well,\n\n38:36.160 --> 38:39.500\n it was another, basically a unified theory\n\n38:39.500 --> 38:41.580\n of the electromagnetic force and the weak force.\n\n38:41.580 --> 38:43.060\n So once you bring in the Higgs field,\n\n38:43.060 --> 38:45.620\n you can combine two of the forces into one.\n\n38:45.620 --> 38:47.900\n So it turns out the electromagnetic force\n\n38:47.900 --> 38:49.660\n and the weak force are just two aspects\n\n38:49.660 --> 38:52.420\n of the same fundamental force.\n\n38:52.420 --> 38:54.760\n And at the LHC, we go to high enough energies\n\n38:54.760 --> 38:59.460\n that you see these two forces unifying effectively.\n\n38:59.460 --> 39:04.260\n So first of all, it started as a theoretical notion,\n\n39:04.260 --> 39:07.540\n like this is some, and then, I mean,\n\n39:07.540 --> 39:10.660\n wasn't the Higgs called the God particle at some point?\n\n39:10.660 --> 39:13.660\n It was by a guy trying to sell popular science books, yeah.\n\n39:13.660 --> 39:17.880\n Yeah, but I mean, I remember because when I was hearing it,\n\n39:17.880 --> 39:22.060\n I thought it would, I mean, that would solve a lot of,\n\n39:22.060 --> 39:26.340\n that unify a lot of our ideas of physics was my notion.\n\n39:26.340 --> 39:29.020\n But maybe you can speak to that.\n\n39:29.020 --> 39:32.540\n Is it as big of a leap as a God particle\n\n39:32.540 --> 39:37.340\n or is it a Jesus particle, which, you know,\n\n39:37.340 --> 39:39.020\n what's the big contribution of Higgs\n\n39:39.020 --> 39:40.780\n in terms of this unification power?\n\n39:40.780 --> 39:42.940\n Yeah, I mean, to understand that,\n\n39:42.940 --> 39:45.060\n it maybe helps know the history a little bit.\n\n39:45.060 --> 39:47.740\n So when the, what we call electroweak theory\n\n39:47.740 --> 39:50.580\n was put together, which is where you unify electromagnetism\n\n39:50.580 --> 39:53.280\n with the weak force and Higgs is involved in all of that.\n\n39:53.280 --> 39:55.420\n So that theory, which was written in the mid 70s,\n\n39:55.420 --> 39:59.380\n predicted the existence of four new particles,\n\n39:59.380 --> 40:01.780\n the W plus boson, the W minus boson,\n\n40:01.780 --> 40:03.500\n the Z boson and the Higgs boson.\n\n40:03.500 --> 40:04.780\n So there were these four particles\n\n40:04.780 --> 40:06.020\n that came with the theory,\n\n40:06.020 --> 40:07.500\n that were predicted by the theory.\n\n40:07.500 --> 40:11.620\n In 1983, 84, the W's and the Z particles\n\n40:11.620 --> 40:14.320\n were discovered at an accelerator at CERN\n\n40:14.320 --> 40:15.980\n called the super proton synchrotron,\n\n40:15.980 --> 40:19.240\n which was a seven kilometer particle collider.\n\n40:19.240 --> 40:22.820\n So three of the bits of this theory had already been found.\n\n40:22.820 --> 40:25.560\n So people were pretty confident from the 80s\n\n40:25.560 --> 40:27.060\n that the Higgs must exist\n\n40:27.060 --> 40:30.800\n because it was a part of this family of particles\n\n40:30.800 --> 40:33.020\n that this theoretical structure only works\n\n40:33.020 --> 40:34.460\n if the Higgs is there.\n\n40:34.460 --> 40:36.540\n So what then happens,\n\n40:36.540 --> 40:37.380\n and so you've got this question about\n\n40:37.380 --> 40:39.420\n why is the LHC the size it is?\n\n40:39.420 --> 40:41.500\n Well, actually the tunnel that the LHC is in\n\n40:41.500 --> 40:42.780\n was not built for the LHC.\n\n40:42.780 --> 40:45.140\n It was built for a previous accelerator\n\n40:45.140 --> 40:48.740\n called the large electron positron collider.\n\n40:48.740 --> 40:53.740\n So that began operation in the late 80s, early 90s.\n\n40:53.800 --> 40:55.220\n They basically, that's when they dug\n\n40:55.220 --> 40:56.420\n the 27 kilometer tunnel.\n\n40:56.420 --> 40:58.020\n They put this accelerator into it,\n\n40:58.020 --> 40:59.860\n the collider that fires electrons\n\n40:59.860 --> 41:02.660\n and anti electrons at each other, electrons and positrons.\n\n41:02.660 --> 41:05.180\n So the purpose of that machine was,\n\n41:05.180 --> 41:06.700\n well, it was actually to look for the Higgs.\n\n41:06.700 --> 41:08.700\n That was one of the things it was trying to do.\n\n41:08.700 --> 41:11.380\n It didn't have enough energy to do it in the end.\n\n41:11.380 --> 41:13.820\n But the main thing it achieved was it studied\n\n41:13.820 --> 41:17.540\n the W and the Z particles at very high precision.\n\n41:17.540 --> 41:19.300\n So it made loads of these things.\n\n41:19.300 --> 41:20.540\n Previously, you can only make a few of them\n\n41:20.540 --> 41:21.460\n at the previous accelerator.\n\n41:21.460 --> 41:24.500\n So you could study these really, really precisely.\n\n41:24.500 --> 41:25.680\n And by studying their properties,\n\n41:25.680 --> 41:28.220\n you could really test this electroweak theory\n\n41:28.220 --> 41:29.820\n that had been invented in the 70s\n\n41:29.820 --> 41:31.260\n and really make sure that it worked.\n\n41:31.260 --> 41:36.260\n So actually by 1999, when this machine turned off,\n\n41:36.380 --> 41:39.500\n people knew, well, okay, you never know\n\n41:39.500 --> 41:41.420\n until you find the thing.\n\n41:41.420 --> 41:43.000\n But people were really confident\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:44.800\n this electroweak theory was right.\n\n41:44.800 --> 41:46.820\n And that the Higgs almost,\n\n41:46.820 --> 41:49.860\n the Higgs or something very like the Higgs had to exist\n\n41:49.860 --> 41:52.220\n because otherwise the whole thing doesn't work.\n\n41:52.220 --> 41:54.000\n It'd be really weird if you could discover\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:55.900\n and these particles, they all behave exactly\n\n41:55.900 --> 41:57.320\n as your theory tells you they should.\n\n41:57.320 --> 42:00.900\n But somehow this key piece of the picture is not there.\n\n42:00.900 --> 42:03.920\n So in a way, it depends how you look at it.\n\n42:03.920 --> 42:05.780\n The discovery of the Higgs on its own\n\n42:07.020 --> 42:09.980\n is obviously a huge achievement in many,\n\n42:09.980 --> 42:12.300\n both experimentally and theoretically.\n\n42:12.300 --> 42:15.260\n On the other hand, it's like having a jigsaw puzzle\n\n42:15.260 --> 42:17.100\n where every piece has been filled in.\n\n42:17.100 --> 42:19.020\n You have this beautiful image, there's one gap\n\n42:19.020 --> 42:22.860\n and you kind of know that piece must be there somewhere.\n\n42:22.860 --> 42:27.860\n So the discovery in itself, although it's important,\n\n42:29.020 --> 42:30.420\n is not so interesting.\n\n42:30.420 --> 42:34.340\n It's like a confirmation of the obvious at that point.\n\n42:34.340 --> 42:36.020\n But what makes it interesting\n\n42:36.020 --> 42:38.080\n is not that it just completes the standard model,\n\n42:38.080 --> 42:39.980\n which is a theory that we've known\n\n42:39.980 --> 42:44.780\n had the basic layout offs for 40 years or more now.\n\n42:44.780 --> 42:48.420\n It's that the Higgs actually is a unique particle.\n\n42:48.420 --> 42:50.540\n It's very different to any of the other particles\n\n42:50.540 --> 42:51.860\n in the standard model.\n\n42:51.860 --> 42:55.260\n And it's a theoretically very troublesome particle.\n\n42:55.260 --> 42:59.240\n There are a lot of nasty things to do with the Higgs,\n\n42:59.240 --> 43:00.860\n but also opportunities.\n\n43:00.860 --> 43:02.580\n So that we basically, we don't really understand\n\n43:02.580 --> 43:06.260\n how such an object can exist in the form that it does.\n\n43:06.260 --> 43:08.500\n So there are lots of reasons for thinking\n\n43:08.500 --> 43:12.540\n that the Higgs must come with a bunch of other particles\n\n43:12.540 --> 43:15.020\n or that it's perhaps made of other things.\n\n43:15.020 --> 43:16.460\n So it's not a fundamental particle,\n\n43:16.460 --> 43:17.940\n that it's made of smaller things.\n\n43:17.940 --> 43:19.580\n I can talk about that if you like a bit.\n\n43:19.580 --> 43:23.180\n That's still a notion, so the Higgs\n\n43:23.180 --> 43:24.820\n might not be a fundamental particle,\n\n43:24.820 --> 43:27.180\n that there might be some, it might, oh man.\n\n43:27.180 --> 43:31.080\n So that is an idea, it's not been demonstrated to be true.\n\n43:31.080 --> 43:33.820\n But I mean, all of these ideas basically come\n\n43:33.820 --> 43:37.940\n from the fact that this is a problem\n\n43:37.940 --> 43:40.100\n that motivated a lot of development in physics\n\n43:40.100 --> 43:42.380\n in the last 30 years or so.\n\n43:42.380 --> 43:44.780\n And it's this basic fact that the Higgs field,\n\n43:44.780 --> 43:47.260\n which is this field that's everywhere in the universe,\n\n43:47.260 --> 43:49.060\n this is the thing that gives mass to the particles.\n\n43:49.060 --> 43:51.340\n And the Higgs field is different from all the other fields\n\n43:51.340 --> 43:54.420\n in that, let's say you take the electromagnetic field,\n\n43:54.420 --> 43:56.080\n which is, if we actually were to measure\n\n43:56.080 --> 43:57.420\n the electromagnetic field in this room,\n\n43:57.420 --> 43:58.900\n we would measure all kinds of stuff going on\n\n43:58.900 --> 44:00.940\n because there's light, there's gonna be microwaves\n\n44:00.940 --> 44:02.100\n and radio waves and stuff.\n\n44:02.100 --> 44:04.940\n But let's say we could go to a really, really remote part\n\n44:04.940 --> 44:07.660\n of empty space and shield it and put a big box around it\n\n44:07.660 --> 44:10.060\n and then measure the electromagnetic field in that box.\n\n44:10.060 --> 44:12.180\n The field would be almost zero,\n\n44:12.180 --> 44:14.780\n apart from some little quantum fluctuations,\n\n44:14.780 --> 44:16.980\n but basically it goes to naught.\n\n44:16.980 --> 44:19.140\n The Higgs field has a value everywhere.\n\n44:19.140 --> 44:20.700\n So it's a bit like the whole,\n\n44:20.700 --> 44:23.440\n it's like the entire space has got this energy\n\n44:23.440 --> 44:25.420\n stored in the Higgs field, which is not zero,\n\n44:25.420 --> 44:28.860\n it's finite, it's a bit like having the temperature\n\n44:28.860 --> 44:32.380\n of space raised to some background temperature.\n\n44:33.900 --> 44:36.900\n And it's that energy that gives mass to the particles.\n\n44:36.900 --> 44:40.460\n So the reason that electrons and quarks have mass\n\n44:40.460 --> 44:42.440\n is through the interaction with this energy\n\n44:42.440 --> 44:44.820\n that's stored in the Higgs field.\n\n44:44.820 --> 44:49.820\n Now, it turns out that the precise value this energy has\n\n44:50.620 --> 44:55.620\n has to be very carefully tuned if you want a universe\n\n44:55.700 --> 44:58.140\n where interesting stuff can happen.\n\n44:58.140 --> 45:00.660\n So if you push the Higgs field down,\n\n45:00.660 --> 45:03.100\n it has a tendency to collapse to,\n\n45:03.100 --> 45:04.020\n well, there's a tendency,\n\n45:04.020 --> 45:05.620\n if you do your sort of naive calculations,\n\n45:05.620 --> 45:08.260\n there are basically two possible likely configurations\n\n45:08.260 --> 45:11.320\n for the Higgs field, which is either it's zero everywhere,\n\n45:11.320 --> 45:12.480\n in which case you have a universe\n\n45:12.480 --> 45:15.860\n which is just particles with no mass that can't form atoms\n\n45:15.860 --> 45:18.060\n and just fly about at the speed of light,\n\n45:18.060 --> 45:20.700\n or it explodes to an enormous value,\n\n45:20.700 --> 45:21.820\n what we call the Planck scale,\n\n45:21.820 --> 45:24.140\n which is the scale of quantum gravity.\n\n45:24.140 --> 45:27.060\n And at that point, if the Higgs field was that strong,\n\n45:27.060 --> 45:28.900\n even an electron would become so massive\n\n45:28.900 --> 45:31.200\n that it would collapse into a black hole.\n\n45:31.200 --> 45:33.100\n And then you have a universe made of black holes\n\n45:33.100 --> 45:34.940\n and nothing like us.\n\n45:34.940 --> 45:37.640\n So it seems that the strength of the Higgs field\n\n45:37.640 --> 45:40.180\n is to achieve the value that we see\n\n45:40.180 --> 45:42.900\n requires what we call fine tuning of the laws of physics.\n\n45:42.900 --> 45:45.340\n You have to fiddle around with the other fields\n\n45:45.340 --> 45:47.340\n in the Standard Model and their properties\n\n45:47.340 --> 45:50.780\n to just get it to this right sort of Goldilocks value\n\n45:50.780 --> 45:53.100\n that allows atoms to exist.\n\n45:53.100 --> 45:54.580\n This is deeply fishy.\n\n45:54.580 --> 45:57.380\n People really dislike this.\n\n45:57.380 --> 45:59.420\n Well, yeah, I guess, so what would be,\n\n45:59.420 --> 46:00.840\n so two explanations.\n\n46:00.840 --> 46:03.060\n One, there's a god that designed this perfectly,\n\n46:03.060 --> 46:05.580\n and two is there's an infinite number\n\n46:05.580 --> 46:07.020\n of alternate universes,\n\n46:07.020 --> 46:10.300\n and we just happen to be in the one in which life\n\n46:10.300 --> 46:12.380\n is possible, complexity.\n\n46:12.380 --> 46:15.540\n So when you say, I mean, life, any kind of complexity,\n\n46:15.540 --> 46:19.980\n that's not either complete chaos or black holes.\n\n46:21.500 --> 46:22.760\n I mean, how does that make you feel?\n\n46:22.760 --> 46:23.600\n What do you make of that?\n\n46:23.600 --> 46:25.260\n That's such a fascinating notion\n\n46:25.260 --> 46:28.340\n that this perfectly tuned field\n\n46:28.340 --> 46:31.120\n that's the same everywhere is there.\n\n46:31.120 --> 46:33.140\n What do you make of that?\n\n46:33.140 --> 46:34.200\n Yeah, what do you make of that?\n\n46:34.200 --> 46:35.300\n I mean, yeah, so you laid out\n\n46:35.300 --> 46:36.660\n two of the possible explanations.\n\n46:36.660 --> 46:37.500\n Really?\n\n46:37.500 --> 46:38.820\n Some, well, yeah, I mean, well,\n\n46:38.820 --> 46:41.060\n someone, some cosmic creator went,\n\n46:41.060 --> 46:43.140\n yeah, let's fix that to be at the right level.\n\n46:43.140 --> 46:44.420\n That's one possibility, I guess.\n\n46:44.420 --> 46:45.900\n It's not a scientifically testable one,\n\n46:45.900 --> 46:48.740\n but theoretically, I guess, it's possible.\n\n46:48.740 --> 46:50.860\n Sorry to interrupt, but there could also be\n\n46:50.860 --> 46:53.460\n not a designer, but couldn't there be just,\n\n46:54.540 --> 46:55.980\n I guess I'm not sure what that would be,\n\n46:55.980 --> 46:58.240\n but some kind of force that,\n\n46:58.240 --> 47:03.240\n that some kind of mechanism\n\n47:03.240 --> 47:08.240\n by which this kind of field is enforced\n\n47:09.840 --> 47:11.920\n in order to create complexity,\n\n47:11.920 --> 47:16.280\n basically forces that pull the universe\n\n47:16.280 --> 47:19.800\n towards an interesting complexity.\n\n47:19.800 --> 47:21.360\n I mean, yeah, I mean, there are people\n\n47:21.360 --> 47:22.280\n who have those ideas.\n\n47:22.280 --> 47:23.600\n I don't really subscribe to them.\n\n47:23.600 --> 47:25.520\n As I'm saying, it sounds really stupid.\n\n47:25.520 --> 47:27.120\n No, I mean, there are definitely people\n\n47:27.120 --> 47:29.400\n that make those kind of arguments.\n\n47:29.400 --> 47:33.040\n There's ideas that, I think it's Lee Smolin's idea,\n\n47:33.040 --> 47:38.040\n or one, I think, that universes are born inside black holes.\n\n47:38.120 --> 47:40.280\n And so, universes, they basically have\n\n47:40.280 --> 47:42.480\n like Darwinian evolution of the universe,\n\n47:42.480 --> 47:44.800\n where universes give birth to other universes.\n\n47:44.800 --> 47:46.720\n And if universes where black holes can form\n\n47:46.720 --> 47:48.760\n are more likely to give birth to more universes,\n\n47:48.760 --> 47:51.260\n so you end up with universes which have similar laws.\n\n47:51.260 --> 47:52.600\n I mean, I don't know, whatever.\n\n47:52.600 --> 47:57.080\n Well, I talked to Lee recently on this podcast,\n\n47:57.080 --> 48:02.080\n and he's a reminder to me that the physics community\n\n48:02.360 --> 48:05.600\n has like so many interesting characters in it.\n\n48:05.600 --> 48:06.960\n It's fascinating.\n\n48:06.960 --> 48:08.040\n Anyway, sorry, so.\n\n48:08.040 --> 48:10.120\n I mean, as an experimentalist, I tend to sort of think,\n\n48:10.120 --> 48:12.760\n these are interesting ideas, but they're not really testable,\n\n48:12.760 --> 48:14.720\n so I tend not to think about them very much.\n\n48:14.720 --> 48:17.600\n So, I mean, going back to the science of this,\n\n48:17.600 --> 48:19.120\n there is an explanation.\n\n48:19.120 --> 48:21.240\n There is a possible solution to this problem of the Higgs,\n\n48:21.240 --> 48:25.200\n which doesn't involve multiverses or creators fiddling about\n\n48:25.200 --> 48:26.560\n with the laws of physics.\n\n48:26.560 --> 48:28.400\n If the most popular solution\n\n48:28.400 --> 48:30.440\n was something called supersymmetry,\n\n48:30.440 --> 48:34.800\n which is a theory which involves a new type of symmetry\n\n48:34.800 --> 48:35.720\n of the universe.\n\n48:35.720 --> 48:37.680\n In fact, it's one of the last types of symmetries\n\n48:37.680 --> 48:38.560\n that it's possible to have\n\n48:38.560 --> 48:40.400\n that we haven't already seen in nature,\n\n48:40.400 --> 48:43.600\n which is a symmetry between force particles\n\n48:43.600 --> 48:44.760\n and matter particles.\n\n48:44.760 --> 48:47.880\n So what we call fermions, which are the matter particles\n\n48:47.880 --> 48:49.920\n and bosons, which are force particles.\n\n48:49.920 --> 48:52.600\n And if you have supersymmetry, then there is a super partner\n\n48:52.600 --> 48:55.920\n for every particle in the standard model.\n\n48:55.920 --> 48:57.520\n And without going into the details,\n\n48:57.520 --> 48:59.320\n the effect of this basically is that you have\n\n48:59.320 --> 49:01.320\n a whole bunch of other fields,\n\n49:01.320 --> 49:04.240\n and these fields cancel out the effect\n\n49:04.240 --> 49:05.680\n of the standard model fields,\n\n49:05.680 --> 49:09.000\n and they stabilize the Higgs field at a nice sensible value.\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.360\n So in supersymmetry, you naturally,\n\n49:11.360 --> 49:14.280\n without any tinkering about with the constants of nature\n\n49:14.280 --> 49:17.360\n or anything, you get a Higgs field with a nice value,\n\n49:17.360 --> 49:18.960\n which is the one we see.\n\n49:18.960 --> 49:20.200\n So this is one of the,\n\n49:20.200 --> 49:22.000\n and supersymmetry's also got lots of other things\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:22.840\n going for it.\n\n49:22.840 --> 49:25.360\n It predicts the existence of a dark matter particle,\n\n49:25.360 --> 49:27.000\n which would be great.\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:30.120\n It potentially suggests that the strong force\n\n49:30.120 --> 49:32.760\n and the electroweak force unify at high energy.\n\n49:32.760 --> 49:35.360\n So lots of reasons people thought this was a productive idea.\n\n49:35.360 --> 49:37.800\n And when the LHC was, just before it was turned on,\n\n49:37.800 --> 49:39.600\n there was a lot of hype, I guess,\n\n49:39.600 --> 49:42.440\n a lot of an expectation that we would discover\n\n49:42.440 --> 49:44.280\n these super partners because,\n\n49:44.280 --> 49:46.080\n and particularly the main reason was\n\n49:46.080 --> 49:50.240\n that if supersymmetry stabilizes the Higgs field\n\n49:50.240 --> 49:52.960\n at this nice Goldilocks value,\n\n49:52.960 --> 49:55.760\n these super particles should have a mass\n\n49:55.760 --> 49:58.520\n around the energy that we're probing at the LHC,\n\n49:58.520 --> 49:59.920\n around the energy of the Higgs.\n\n49:59.920 --> 50:01.520\n So it was kind of thought, you discover the Higgs,\n\n50:01.520 --> 50:03.600\n you probably discover super partners as well.\n\n50:03.600 --> 50:06.200\n So once you start creating ripples in this Higgs field,\n\n50:06.200 --> 50:08.680\n you should be able to see these kinds of,\n\n50:08.680 --> 50:09.520\n you should be, yeah.\n\n50:09.520 --> 50:11.000\n So the super fields would be there.\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:12.320\n When I, at the very beginning I said,\n\n50:12.320 --> 50:13.720\n we're probing the vacuum.\n\n50:13.720 --> 50:15.200\n What I mean is really that, you know,\n\n50:15.200 --> 50:16.680\n okay, let's say these super fields exist.\n\n50:16.680 --> 50:18.200\n The vacuum contains super fields.\n\n50:18.200 --> 50:20.160\n They're there, these supersymmetric fields.\n\n50:20.160 --> 50:22.640\n If we hit them hard enough, we can make them vibrate.\n\n50:22.640 --> 50:24.840\n We see super particles come flying out.\n\n50:24.840 --> 50:26.320\n That's the sort of, that's the idea.\n\n50:26.320 --> 50:27.160\n That's the whole, okay.\n\n50:27.160 --> 50:28.000\n That's the whole point.\n\n50:29.600 --> 50:30.680\n But we haven't.\n\n50:30.680 --> 50:31.520\n But we haven't.\n\n50:31.520 --> 50:33.240\n So, so far at least, I mean,\n\n50:33.240 --> 50:37.960\n we've had now a decade of data taking at the LHC.\n\n50:38.920 --> 50:41.760\n No signs of super partners have,\n\n50:41.760 --> 50:43.360\n supersymmetric particles have been found.\n\n50:43.360 --> 50:46.000\n In fact, no signs of any physics, any new particles\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:47.520\n beyond the Standard Model have been found.\n\n50:47.520 --> 50:49.520\n So supersymmetry is not the only thing that can do this.\n\n50:49.520 --> 50:51.440\n There are other theories that involve\n\n50:51.440 --> 50:53.160\n additional dimensions of space\n\n50:53.160 --> 50:55.680\n or potentially involve the Higgs boson\n\n50:55.680 --> 50:56.920\n being made of smaller things,\n\n50:56.920 --> 50:58.360\n being made of other particles.\n\n50:58.360 --> 50:59.480\n Yeah, that's an interesting, you know,\n\n50:59.480 --> 51:00.560\n I haven't heard that before.\n\n51:00.560 --> 51:02.320\n That's really, that's an interesting,\n\n51:02.320 --> 51:03.640\n but can you maybe linger on that?\n\n51:03.640 --> 51:06.400\n Like what, what could be,\n\n51:06.400 --> 51:08.880\n what could the Higgs particle be made of?\n\n51:08.880 --> 51:11.560\n Well, so the oldest, I think the original ideas about this\n\n51:11.560 --> 51:14.080\n was these theories called technicolor,\n\n51:14.080 --> 51:17.320\n which were basically like an analogy with the strong force.\n\n51:17.320 --> 51:21.440\n So the idea was the Higgs boson was a bound state\n\n51:21.440 --> 51:24.480\n of two very strongly interacting particles\n\n51:24.480 --> 51:25.560\n that were a bit like quarks.\n\n51:25.560 --> 51:29.200\n So like quarks, but I guess higher energy things\n\n51:29.200 --> 51:30.440\n with a super strong force.\n\n51:30.440 --> 51:31.880\n So not the strong force, but a new force\n\n51:31.880 --> 51:33.000\n that was very strong.\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:36.480\n And the Higgs was a bound state of these, these objects.\n\n51:36.480 --> 51:38.440\n And the Higgs would in principle, if that was right,\n\n51:38.440 --> 51:42.400\n would be the first in a series of technicolor particles.\n\n51:42.400 --> 51:45.560\n Technicolor, I think not being a theorist,\n\n51:45.560 --> 51:48.120\n but it's not, it's basically not done very well,\n\n51:48.120 --> 51:49.600\n particularly since the LHC found the Higgs,\n\n51:49.600 --> 51:52.360\n that kind of, it rules out, you know,\n\n51:52.360 --> 51:53.440\n a lot of these technicolor theories,\n\n51:53.440 --> 51:55.440\n but there are other things that are a bit like technicolor.\n\n51:55.440 --> 52:00.440\n So there's a theory called partial composite,\n\n52:00.560 --> 52:02.560\n which is an idea that some of my colleagues\n\n52:02.560 --> 52:04.360\n at Cambridge have worked on,\n\n52:04.360 --> 52:06.840\n which is a similar sort of idea that the Higgs\n\n52:06.840 --> 52:10.440\n is a bound state of some strongly interacting particles,\n\n52:10.440 --> 52:13.000\n and that the standard model particles themselves,\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:15.120\n the more exotic ones like the top quark\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:20.480\n are also sort of mixtures of these composite particles.\n\n52:20.480 --> 52:23.320\n So it's a kind of an extension to the standard model,\n\n52:23.320 --> 52:25.280\n which explains this problem\n\n52:25.280 --> 52:28.560\n with the Higgs bosons, Goldilocks value,\n\n52:28.560 --> 52:31.160\n but also helps us understand we have,\n\n52:31.160 --> 52:32.840\n we're in a situation now, again,\n\n52:32.840 --> 52:34.480\n a bit like the periodic table,\n\n52:34.480 --> 52:38.640\n where we have six quarks, six leptons in this kind of,\n\n52:38.640 --> 52:40.000\n you can arrange in this nice table\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.480\n and you can see these columns where the patterns repeat\n\n52:42.480 --> 52:46.160\n and you go, okay, maybe there's something deeper\n\n52:46.160 --> 52:47.640\n going on here, you know,\n\n52:47.640 --> 52:49.640\n and so this would potentially be something,\n\n52:49.640 --> 52:52.880\n this partial composite theory could explain,\n\n52:52.880 --> 52:54.360\n a sort of enlarge this picture\n\n52:54.360 --> 52:56.480\n that allows us to see the whole symmetrical pattern\n\n52:56.480 --> 52:59.120\n and understand what the ingredients, why do we have,\n\n52:59.120 --> 53:02.160\n so one of the big questions in particle physics is,\n\n53:02.160 --> 53:06.240\n why are there three copies of the matter particles?\n\n53:06.240 --> 53:07.920\n So in what we call the first generation,\n\n53:07.920 --> 53:08.920\n which is what we're made of,\n\n53:08.920 --> 53:11.760\n there's the electron, the electron neutrino,\n\n53:11.760 --> 53:13.160\n the up quark and the down quark,\n\n53:13.160 --> 53:15.640\n they're the most common matter particles in the universe,\n\n53:15.640 --> 53:18.800\n but then there are copies of these four particles\n\n53:18.800 --> 53:20.360\n in the second and the third generations,\n\n53:20.360 --> 53:23.120\n so things like nuons and top quarks and other stuff,\n\n53:23.120 --> 53:25.240\n we don't know why, we see these patterns,\n\n53:25.240 --> 53:26.440\n we have no idea where it comes from,\n\n53:26.440 --> 53:28.880\n so that's another big question, you know,\n\n53:28.880 --> 53:32.920\n can we find out the deeper order that explains\n\n53:32.920 --> 53:36.440\n this particular periodic table of particles that we see?\n\n53:36.440 --> 53:40.240\n Is it possible that the deeper order includes\n\n53:40.240 --> 53:42.400\n like almost a single entity,\n\n53:42.400 --> 53:44.960\n so like something that I guess like string theory\n\n53:44.960 --> 53:49.960\n dreams about, is this essentially the dream,\n\n53:50.240 --> 53:54.120\n is to discover something simple, beautiful and unifying?\n\n53:54.120 --> 53:55.640\n Yeah, I mean, that is the dream,\n\n53:55.640 --> 53:59.480\n and I think for some people, for a lot of people,\n\n53:59.480 --> 54:00.400\n it still is the dream,\n\n54:00.400 --> 54:03.800\n so there's a great book by Steven Weinberg,\n\n54:03.800 --> 54:05.760\n who is one of the theoretical physicists\n\n54:05.760 --> 54:08.360\n who was instrumental in building the Standard Model,\n\n54:08.360 --> 54:12.000\n so he came up with some others with the electroweak theory,\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.560\n the theory that unified electromagnetism and the weak force,\n\n54:14.560 --> 54:15.680\n and he wrote this book,\n\n54:15.680 --> 54:18.080\n I think it was towards the end of the 80s, early 90s,\n\n54:18.080 --> 54:20.000\n called Dreams of a Final Theory,\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.920\n which is a very lovely, quite short book\n\n54:22.920 --> 54:26.200\n about this idea of a final unifying theory\n\n54:26.200 --> 54:27.560\n that brings everything together,\n\n54:27.560 --> 54:29.440\n and I think you get a sense reading his book\n\n54:29.440 --> 54:31.760\n written at the end of the 80s, early 90s,\n\n54:31.760 --> 54:35.600\n that there was this feeling that such a theory was coming,\n\n54:37.760 --> 54:39.200\n and that was the time when string theory\n\n54:39.200 --> 54:41.960\n was very exciting, so string theory,\n\n54:41.960 --> 54:44.080\n there's been this thing called the superstring revolution,\n\n54:44.080 --> 54:46.080\n and theoretical physicists were very excited,\n\n54:46.080 --> 54:47.960\n they discovered these theoretical objects,\n\n54:47.960 --> 54:49.440\n these little vibrating loops of string\n\n54:49.440 --> 54:52.440\n that in principle not only was a quantum theory of gravity\n\n54:52.440 --> 54:54.840\n but could explain all the particles in the Standard Model\n\n54:54.840 --> 54:55.760\n and bring it all together,\n\n54:55.760 --> 54:59.520\n and as you say, you have one object, the string,\n\n54:59.520 --> 55:02.560\n and you can pluck it, and the way it vibrates\n\n55:02.560 --> 55:03.840\n gives you these different notes,\n\n55:03.840 --> 55:05.960\n each of which is a different particle,\n\n55:05.960 --> 55:08.160\n so it's a very lovely idea,\n\n55:08.160 --> 55:11.920\n but the problem is that, well, there's a few,\n\n55:11.920 --> 55:14.680\n people discover that mathematics is very difficult,\n\n55:14.680 --> 55:17.640\n so people have spent three decades or more\n\n55:17.640 --> 55:19.120\n trying to understand string theory,\n\n55:19.120 --> 55:21.520\n and I think if you spoke to most string theorists,\n\n55:21.520 --> 55:22.640\n they would probably freely admit\n\n55:22.640 --> 55:24.920\n that no one really knows what string theory is yet,\n\n55:24.920 --> 55:26.000\n I mean, there's been a lot of work,\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:27.320\n but it's not really understood,\n\n55:27.320 --> 55:31.240\n and the other problem is that string theory\n\n55:31.240 --> 55:34.040\n mostly makes predictions about physics\n\n55:34.040 --> 55:36.560\n that occurs at energies far beyond\n\n55:36.560 --> 55:40.600\n what we will ever be able to probe in the laboratory.\n\n55:40.600 --> 55:42.200\n Yeah, probably ever.\n\n55:42.200 --> 55:44.840\n By the way, so sorry to take a million tangents,\n\n55:44.840 --> 55:48.080\n but is there room for complete innovation\n\n55:48.080 --> 55:50.240\n of how to build a particle collider\n\n55:50.240 --> 55:52.720\n that could give us an order of magnitude increase\n\n55:52.720 --> 55:55.200\n in the kind of energies,\n\n55:55.200 --> 55:58.520\n or do we need to keep just increasing the size of things?\n\n55:58.520 --> 56:00.920\n I mean, maybe, yeah, I mean, there are ideas,\n\n56:00.920 --> 56:03.920\n to give you a sense of the gulf that has to be bridged.\n\n56:03.920 --> 56:08.920\n So the LHC collides particles at an energy\n\n56:09.320 --> 56:13.440\n of what we call 14 tera electron volts,\n\n56:13.440 --> 56:15.040\n so that's basically the equivalent\n\n56:15.040 --> 56:19.200\n if you've accelerated a proton through 14 trillion volts.\n\n56:19.200 --> 56:20.520\n That gets us to the energies\n\n56:20.520 --> 56:23.240\n where the Higgs and these weak particles live.\n\n56:23.240 --> 56:24.480\n They're very massive.\n\n56:24.480 --> 56:27.760\n The scale where strings become manifest\n\n56:27.760 --> 56:29.320\n is something called the Planck scale,\n\n56:29.320 --> 56:31.960\n which I think is of the order 10 to the,\n\n56:31.960 --> 56:33.720\n hang on, get this right,\n\n56:33.720 --> 56:35.840\n it's 10 to the 18 giga electron volts,\n\n56:35.840 --> 56:40.840\n so about 10 to the 15 tera electron volts.\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:44.760\n So you're talking trillions of times more energy.\n\n56:44.760 --> 56:49.760\n Yeah, 10 to the 15th or 10 to the 14th larger, I don't even.\n\n56:49.760 --> 56:50.840\n It's of that order.\n\n56:50.840 --> 56:52.680\n It's a very big number.\n\n56:52.680 --> 56:54.400\n So we're not talking just an order\n\n56:54.400 --> 56:55.600\n of magnitude increase in energy,\n\n56:55.600 --> 56:58.600\n we're talking 14 orders of magnitude energy increase.\n\n56:58.600 --> 57:01.160\n So to give you a sense of what that would look like,\n\n57:01.160 --> 57:03.000\n were you to build a particle accelerator\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:04.760\n with today's technology.\n\n57:04.760 --> 57:07.960\n Bigger or smaller than our solar system?\n\n57:07.960 --> 57:09.120\n The size of the galaxy.\n\n57:09.120 --> 57:10.040\n The galaxy.\n\n57:10.040 --> 57:11.480\n So you'd need to put a particle accelerator\n\n57:11.480 --> 57:14.560\n that circled the Milky Way to get to the energies\n\n57:14.560 --> 57:17.600\n where you would see strings if they exist.\n\n57:17.600 --> 57:20.400\n So that is a fundamental problem,\n\n57:20.400 --> 57:22.600\n which is that most of the predictions\n\n57:22.600 --> 57:26.040\n of these unified theories, quantum theories of gravity,\n\n57:26.040 --> 57:29.200\n only make statements that are testable at energies\n\n57:29.200 --> 57:31.160\n that we will not be able to probe,\n\n57:32.200 --> 57:35.200\n and barring some unbelievable,\n\n57:35.200 --> 57:37.160\n completely unexpected technological\n\n57:37.160 --> 57:38.080\n or scientific breakthrough,\n\n57:38.080 --> 57:40.000\n which is almost impossible to imagine.\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:42.800\n You never say never, but it seems very unlikely.\n\n57:42.800 --> 57:45.120\n Yeah, I can just see the news story.\n\n57:45.120 --> 57:48.840\n Elon Musk decides to build a particle collider\n\n57:48.840 --> 57:51.080\n the size of our galaxy.\n\n57:51.080 --> 57:51.920\n We'd have to get together\n\n57:51.920 --> 57:55.120\n with all our galactic neighbors to pay for it, I think.\n\n57:55.120 --> 57:56.720\n What is the exciting possibilities\n\n57:56.720 --> 57:58.960\n of the Large Hadron Collider?\n\n57:58.960 --> 58:00.640\n What is there to be discovered\n\n58:00.640 --> 58:04.160\n in this order of magnitude of scale?\n\n58:04.160 --> 58:09.160\n Is there other bigger efforts on the horizon in this space?\n\n58:09.800 --> 58:12.720\n What are the open problems, the exciting possibilities?\n\n58:12.720 --> 58:14.560\n You mentioned supersymmetry.\n\n58:14.560 --> 58:17.600\n Yeah, so, well, there are lots of new ideas.\n\n58:17.600 --> 58:18.920\n Well, there are lots of problems that we're facing.\n\n58:18.920 --> 58:20.160\n So there's a problem with the Higgs field,\n\n58:20.160 --> 58:23.320\n which supersymmetry was supposed to solve.\n\n58:23.320 --> 58:25.720\n There's the fact that 95% of the universe\n\n58:25.720 --> 58:29.360\n we know from cosmology, astrophysics, is invisible,\n\n58:29.360 --> 58:31.840\n that it's made of dark matter and dark energy,\n\n58:31.840 --> 58:33.520\n which are really just words\n\n58:33.520 --> 58:35.360\n for things that we don't know what they are.\n\n58:35.360 --> 58:37.920\n It's what Donald Rumsfeld called a known unknown.\n\n58:37.920 --> 58:39.880\n So we know we don't know what they are.\n\n58:39.880 --> 58:42.480\n Well, that's better than unknown unknown.\n\n58:42.480 --> 58:43.800\n Yeah, well, there may be some unknown unknowns,\n\n58:43.800 --> 58:47.360\n but by definition we don't know what those are, so, yeah.\n\n58:47.360 --> 58:52.360\n But the hope is a particle accelerator\n\n58:52.480 --> 58:55.560\n could help us make sense of dark energy, dark matter.\n\n58:55.560 --> 58:57.680\n There's still, there's some hope for that?\n\n58:57.680 --> 58:58.760\n There's hope for that, yeah.\n\n58:58.760 --> 59:01.400\n So one of the hopes is the LHC could produce\n\n59:01.400 --> 59:03.800\n a dark matter particle in its collisions.\n\n59:03.800 --> 59:08.360\n And it may be that the LHC\n\n59:08.360 --> 59:09.920\n will still discover new particles,\n\n59:09.920 --> 59:11.920\n that it might still, supersymmetry could still be there.\n\n59:11.920 --> 59:14.320\n It's just maybe more difficult to find\n\n59:14.320 --> 59:15.640\n than we thought originally.\n\n59:15.640 --> 59:18.520\n And dark matter particles might be being produced,\n\n59:18.520 --> 59:20.600\n but we're just not looking in the right part of the data\n\n59:20.600 --> 59:22.120\n for them, that's possible.\n\n59:22.120 --> 59:23.320\n It might be that we need more data,\n\n59:23.320 --> 59:24.800\n that these processes are very rare\n\n59:24.800 --> 59:26.600\n and we need to collect lots and lots of data\n\n59:26.600 --> 59:27.600\n before we see them.\n\n59:27.600 --> 59:29.880\n But I think a lot of people would say now\n\n59:29.880 --> 59:33.720\n that the chances of the LHC\n\n59:33.720 --> 59:36.000\n directly discovering new particles\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:37.760\n in the near future is quite slim.\n\n59:37.760 --> 59:40.800\n It may be that we need a decade more data\n\n59:40.800 --> 59:43.920\n before we can see something, or we may not see anything.\n\n59:43.920 --> 59:45.480\n That's the, that's where we are.\n\n59:45.480 --> 59:48.960\n So, I mean, the physics, the experiments that I work on,\n\n59:48.960 --> 59:50.760\n so I work on a detector called LHCb,\n\n59:50.760 --> 59:52.760\n which is one of these four big detectors\n\n59:52.760 --> 59:54.400\n that are spaced around the ring.\n\n59:54.400 --> 59:57.520\n And we do slightly different stuff to the big guys.\n\n59:57.520 --> 1:00:00.600\n There's two big experiments called Atlas and CMS,\n\n1:00:00.600 --> 1:00:02.720\n 3000 physicists and scientists\n\n1:00:02.720 --> 1:00:04.760\n and computer scientists on them each.\n\n1:00:04.760 --> 1:00:06.080\n They are the ones that discovered the Higgs\n\n1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:08.560\n and they look for supersymmetry and dark matter and so on.\n\n1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:11.200\n What we look at are standard model particles\n\n1:00:11.200 --> 1:00:14.880\n called bequarks, which depending on your preferences,\n\n1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:16.600\n either bottom or beauty,\n\n1:00:16.600 --> 1:00:18.800\n we tend to say beauty because it sounds sexier.\n\n1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:20.440\n Yeah, for sure.\n\n1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:22.680\n But these particles are interesting\n\n1:00:22.680 --> 1:00:25.840\n because they have, we can make lots of them.\n\n1:00:25.840 --> 1:00:28.880\n We make billions or hundreds of billions of these things.\n\n1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:31.560\n You can therefore measure their properties very precisely.\n\n1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:34.400\n So you can make these really lovely precision measurements.\n\n1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:39.400\n And what we are doing really is a sort of complimentary thing\n\n1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:41.920\n to the other big experiments, which is they,\n\n1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:44.120\n if you think of the sort of analogy they often use is,\n\n1:00:44.120 --> 1:00:45.800\n if you imagine you're looking in, you're in the jungle\n\n1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:48.680\n and you're looking for an elephant, say,\n\n1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:52.040\n and you are a hunter and you're kind of like,\n\n1:00:52.040 --> 1:00:53.520\n let's say there's the relevance, very rare.\n\n1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:55.440\n You don't know where in the jungle, the jungle's big.\n\n1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:56.760\n So there's two ways you go about this.\n\n1:00:56.760 --> 1:00:58.720\n Either you can go wandering around the jungle\n\n1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:00.160\n and try and find the elephant.\n\n1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:01.320\n The problem is if the elephant,\n\n1:01:01.320 --> 1:01:02.720\n if there's only one elephant and the jungle's big,\n\n1:01:02.720 --> 1:01:04.760\n the chances of running into it are very small.\n\n1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:07.200\n Or you could look on the ground\n\n1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:09.200\n and see if you see footprints left by the elephant.\n\n1:01:09.200 --> 1:01:11.480\n And if the elephant's moving around, you've got a chance,\n\n1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:12.320\n that you're better chance maybe\n\n1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:13.880\n of seeing the elephant's footprints.\n\n1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:16.080\n If you see the footprints, you go, okay, there's an elephant.\n\n1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:18.320\n I maybe don't know what kind of elephant it is,\n\n1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:20.000\n but I got a sense there's something out there.\n\n1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:21.600\n So that's sort of what we do.\n\n1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:23.040\n We are the footprint people.\n\n1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:25.800\n We are, we're looking for the footprints,\n\n1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:28.800\n the impressions that quantum fields\n\n1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:32.600\n that we haven't managed to directly create the particle of,\n\n1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:33.960\n the effects these quantum fields have\n\n1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:35.560\n on the ordinary standard model fields\n\n1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:36.480\n that we already know about.\n\n1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:39.760\n So these B particles, the way they behave\n\n1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:41.720\n can be influenced by the presence of say,\n\n1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:45.200\n super fields or dark matter fields or whatever you like.\n\n1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:48.640\n And the way they decay and behave can be altered slightly\n\n1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:52.480\n from what our theory tells us they ought to behave.\n\n1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:54.600\n And it's easier to collect huge amounts of data\n\n1:01:54.600 --> 1:01:56.600\n on B quarks.\n\n1:01:56.600 --> 1:01:58.440\n We get billions and billions of these things.\n\n1:01:58.440 --> 1:02:00.280\n You can make very precise measurements.\n\n1:02:00.280 --> 1:02:03.200\n And the only place really at the LHC\n\n1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:05.200\n or really in high energy physics at the moment\n\n1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:08.920\n where there's fairly compelling evidence\n\n1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:10.960\n that there might be something beyond the standard model\n\n1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:15.320\n is in these B, these beauty quarks decays.\n\n1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:18.640\n Just to clarify, which is the difference\n\n1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:20.320\n between the different, the four experiments,\n\n1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:21.600\n for example, that you mentioned,\n\n1:02:21.600 --> 1:02:24.760\n is it the kind of particles that are being collided?\n\n1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:27.160\n Is it the energies which they're collided?\n\n1:02:27.160 --> 1:02:28.960\n What's the fundamental difference\n\n1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:30.440\n between the different experiments?\n\n1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:32.280\n The collisions are the same.\n\n1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:34.480\n What's different is the design of the detectors.\n\n1:02:34.480 --> 1:02:37.040\n So Atlas and CMS are called,\n\n1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:39.760\n they're called what are called general purpose detectors.\n\n1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:42.360\n And they are basically barrel shaped machines\n\n1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:44.440\n and the collisions happen in the middle of the barrel\n\n1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:46.600\n and the barrel captures all the particles\n\n1:02:46.600 --> 1:02:48.040\n that go flying out in every direction.\n\n1:02:48.040 --> 1:02:49.840\n So in a sphere effectively that can fly out\n\n1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:51.840\n and it can record all of those particles.\n\n1:02:51.840 --> 1:02:54.720\n And what's the, sorry to be interrupting,\n\n1:02:54.720 --> 1:02:57.440\n but what's the mechanism of the recording?\n\n1:02:57.440 --> 1:02:59.520\n Oh, so these detectors, if you've seen pictures of them,\n\n1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:03.080\n they're huge, like Atlas is 25 meters high\n\n1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:06.440\n and 45 meters long, they're vast machines,\n\n1:03:07.760 --> 1:03:09.600\n instruments, I guess you should call them really.\n\n1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:11.760\n They are, they're kind of like onions.\n\n1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:15.360\n So they have layers, concentric layers of detectors,\n\n1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:16.480\n different sorts of detectors.\n\n1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:18.160\n So close into the beam pipe,\n\n1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:20.600\n you have what are called usually made of silicon,\n\n1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:21.720\n they're tracking detectors.\n\n1:03:21.720 --> 1:03:23.600\n So they're little made of strips of silicon\n\n1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:24.960\n or pixels of silicon.\n\n1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:26.800\n And when a particle goes through the silicon,\n\n1:03:26.800 --> 1:03:28.520\n it gives a little electrical signal\n\n1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:30.280\n and you get these dots, electrical dots\n\n1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:31.440\n through your detector, which allows you\n\n1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:34.120\n to reconstruct the trajectory of the particle.\n\n1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:34.960\n So that's the middle\n\n1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:36.280\n and then the outsides of these detectors,\n\n1:03:36.280 --> 1:03:37.720\n you have things called calorimeters,\n\n1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:39.600\n which measure the energies of the particles\n\n1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:42.640\n and the very edge you have things called muon chambers,\n\n1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:44.680\n which basically these muon particles,\n\n1:03:44.680 --> 1:03:46.720\n which are the heavy version of the electron,\n\n1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:48.440\n they're like high velocity bullets\n\n1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:50.120\n and they can get right to the edge of the detectors.\n\n1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:52.480\n If you see something at the edge, that's a muon.\n\n1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:54.000\n So that's broadly how they work.\n\n1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:55.720\n And all of that is being recorded.\n\n1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:58.280\n That's all being fed out to, you know, computers.\n\n1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:00.800\n Data must be awesome, okay.\n\n1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:02.000\n So LHCb is different.\n\n1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.680\n So we, because we're looking for these be quarks,\n\n1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:07.960\n be quarks tend to be produced along the beam line.\n\n1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:10.640\n So in a collision, the be quark tend to fly\n\n1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:12.840\n sort of close to the beam pipe.\n\n1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:15.520\n So we built a detector that sort of pyramid cone shaped\n\n1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:18.120\n basically, that just looks in one direction.\n\n1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:20.280\n So we ignore, if you have your collision,\n\n1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:21.120\n stuff goes everywhere.\n\n1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:23.400\n We ignore all the stuff over here and going off sideways.\n\n1:04:23.400 --> 1:04:26.240\n We're just looking in this little region\n\n1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:27.080\n close to the beam pipe\n\n1:04:27.080 --> 1:04:28.720\n where most of these be quarks are made.\n\n1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:33.720\n So is there a different aspect of the sensors involved\n\n1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:37.600\n in the collection of the be quark trajectories?\n\n1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:38.720\n There are some differences.\n\n1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:40.840\n So one of the differences is that,\n\n1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:42.600\n one of the ways you know you've seen a be quark\n\n1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:44.880\n is that be quarks are actually quite long lived\n\n1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:45.920\n by particle standards.\n\n1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:49.120\n So they live for 1.5 trillionths of a second,\n\n1:04:49.120 --> 1:04:50.600\n which is if you're a fundamental particle\n\n1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:51.640\n is a very long time.\n\n1:04:51.640 --> 1:04:54.600\n Cause the Higgs boson, I think lives for about\n\n1:04:54.600 --> 1:04:57.240\n a trillionth of a trillionth of a second,\n\n1:04:57.240 --> 1:04:58.400\n or maybe even less than that.\n\n1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:00.760\n So these are quite long lived things\n\n1:05:00.760 --> 1:05:02.600\n and they will actually fly a little distance\n\n1:05:02.600 --> 1:05:03.440\n before they decay.\n\n1:05:03.440 --> 1:05:06.280\n So they will fly a few centimeters maybe if you're lucky,\n\n1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:07.920\n then they'll decay into other stuff.\n\n1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:10.360\n So what we need to do in the middle of the detector,\n\n1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:12.160\n you wanna be able to see,\n\n1:05:12.160 --> 1:05:14.560\n you have your place where the protons crash into each other\n\n1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:16.880\n and that produces loads of particles that come flying out.\n\n1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:18.960\n So you have loads of lines, loads of tracks\n\n1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:21.320\n that point back to that proton collision.\n\n1:05:21.320 --> 1:05:23.400\n And then you're looking for a couple of other tracks,\n\n1:05:23.400 --> 1:05:25.880\n maybe two or three that point back to a different place\n\n1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:27.360\n that's maybe a few centimeters away\n\n1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:28.400\n from the proton collision.\n\n1:05:28.400 --> 1:05:31.560\n And that's the sign that a little B particle has flown\n\n1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:33.240\n a few centimeters and decayed somewhere else.\n\n1:05:33.240 --> 1:05:36.760\n So we need to be able to very accurately resolve\n\n1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:39.480\n the proton collision from the B particle decay.\n\n1:05:39.480 --> 1:05:42.360\n So the middle of our detector is very sensitive\n\n1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:44.160\n and it gets very close to the collision.\n\n1:05:44.160 --> 1:05:46.520\n So you have this really beautiful delicate\n\n1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:48.360\n silicon detector that sits,\n\n1:05:48.360 --> 1:05:52.360\n I think it's seven millimeters from the beam.\n\n1:05:52.360 --> 1:05:53.920\n And the LHC beam has as much energy\n\n1:05:53.920 --> 1:05:55.200\n as a jumbo jet at takeoff.\n\n1:05:55.200 --> 1:05:57.360\n So it's enough to melt a ton of copper.\n\n1:05:57.360 --> 1:05:59.840\n So you have this furiously powerful thing sitting next\n\n1:05:59.840 --> 1:06:02.320\n to this tiny delicate silicon sensor.\n\n1:06:03.360 --> 1:06:07.120\n So those aspects of our detector that are specialized\n\n1:06:07.120 --> 1:06:09.840\n to measure these particular B quarks\n\n1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:10.880\n that we're interested in.\n\n1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:12.960\n And is there, I mean, I remember seeing somewhere\n\n1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:15.360\n that there's some mention of matter and antimatter\n\n1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:18.280\n connected to the B, these beautiful quarks.\n\n1:06:18.280 --> 1:06:21.600\n Is that, what's the connection?\n\n1:06:23.600 --> 1:06:25.880\n Yeah, what's the connection there?\n\n1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:28.280\n Yeah, so there is a connection, which is that\n\n1:06:29.600 --> 1:06:31.880\n when you produce these B particles,\n\n1:06:31.880 --> 1:06:33.760\n these particles, because you don't see the B quark,\n\n1:06:33.760 --> 1:06:35.400\n you see the thing that B quark is inside.\n\n1:06:35.400 --> 1:06:37.960\n So they're bound up inside what we call beauty particles,\n\n1:06:37.960 --> 1:06:40.640\n where the B quark is joined together with another quark\n\n1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:43.400\n or two, maybe two other quarks, depending on what it is.\n\n1:06:43.400 --> 1:06:46.160\n They're a particular set of these B particles\n\n1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:49.480\n that exhibit this property called oscillation.\n\n1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:52.280\n So if you make a, for the sake of argument,\n\n1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:55.440\n a matter version of one of these B particles,\n\n1:06:55.440 --> 1:06:58.840\n as it travels, because of the magic of quantum mechanics,\n\n1:06:58.840 --> 1:07:01.040\n it oscillates backwards and forwards\n\n1:07:01.040 --> 1:07:03.880\n between its matter and antimatter versions.\n\n1:07:03.880 --> 1:07:06.720\n So it does this weird flipping about backwards and forwards.\n\n1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:09.160\n And what we can use this for is a laboratory\n\n1:07:09.160 --> 1:07:12.880\n for testing the symmetry between matter and antimatter.\n\n1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:15.680\n So if the symmetry between antimatter is precise,\n\n1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:20.040\n it's exact, then we should see these B particles decaying\n\n1:07:20.040 --> 1:07:21.840\n as often as matter, as they do as antimatter,\n\n1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:23.360\n because this oscillation should be even.\n\n1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:26.000\n It should spend as much time in each state.\n\n1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:29.000\n But what we actually see is that one of the states,\n\n1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.720\n it spends more time and it's more likely to decay\n\n1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:32.800\n in one state than the other.\n\n1:07:32.800 --> 1:07:36.960\n So this gives us a way of testing this fundamental symmetry\n\n1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:39.160\n between matter and antimatter.\n\n1:07:39.160 --> 1:07:42.400\n So what can you, sort of returning to the question\n\n1:07:42.400 --> 1:07:44.480\n before about this fundamental symmetry,\n\n1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:46.520\n it seems like if there's perfect symmetry\n\n1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:50.560\n between matter and antimatter,\n\n1:07:50.560 --> 1:07:54.600\n if we have the equal amount of each in our universe,\n\n1:07:54.600 --> 1:07:57.000\n it would just destroy itself.\n\n1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:58.760\n And just like you mentioned,\n\n1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:00.920\n we seem to live in a very unlikely universe\n\n1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:03.520\n where it doesn't destroy itself.\n\n1:08:03.520 --> 1:08:07.280\n So do you have some intuition about why that is?\n\n1:08:07.280 --> 1:08:10.160\n I mean, well, I'm not a theorist.\n\n1:08:10.160 --> 1:08:11.680\n I don't have any particular ideas myself.\n\n1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:13.120\n I mean, I sort of do measurements\n\n1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:14.200\n to try and test these things,\n\n1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:16.000\n but I mean, so the terms of the basic problem\n\n1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:17.800\n is that in the Big Bang,\n\n1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:19.240\n if you use the standard model to figure out\n\n1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:20.120\n what ought to have happened,\n\n1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:21.640\n you should have got equal amounts of matter\n\n1:08:21.640 --> 1:08:22.480\n and antimatter made,\n\n1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:23.880\n because whenever you make a particle\n\n1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:25.440\n in our collisions, for example,\n\n1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:26.800\n when we collide stuff together,\n\n1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:28.440\n you make a particle, you make an antiparticle.\n\n1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:29.480\n They always come together.\n\n1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:30.920\n They always annihilate together.\n\n1:08:30.920 --> 1:08:33.440\n So there's no way of making more matter than antimatter\n\n1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:35.040\n that we've discovered so far.\n\n1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:36.080\n So that means in the Big Bang,\n\n1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:38.200\n you get equal amounts of matter and antimatter.\n\n1:08:38.200 --> 1:08:41.720\n As the universe expands and cools down during the Big Bang,\n\n1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:43.240\n not very long after the Big Bang,\n\n1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:45.040\n I think a few seconds after the Big Bang,\n\n1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:47.280\n you have this event called the Great Annihilation,\n\n1:08:47.280 --> 1:08:49.840\n which is where all the particles and antiparticles\n\n1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:53.520\n smack into each other, annihilate, turn into light mostly,\n\n1:08:53.520 --> 1:08:55.000\n and you end up with a universe later on.\n\n1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:55.960\n If that was what happened,\n\n1:08:55.960 --> 1:08:58.800\n then the universe we live in today would be black and empty,\n\n1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:01.600\n apart from some photons, that would be it.\n\n1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:03.560\n So there is stuff in the universe.\n\n1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:04.960\n It appears to be just made of matter.\n\n1:09:04.960 --> 1:09:08.200\n So there's this big mystery as to how did this happen?\n\n1:09:08.200 --> 1:09:09.720\n And there are various ideas,\n\n1:09:09.720 --> 1:09:13.520\n which all involve sort of physics going on\n\n1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:17.040\n in the first trillionth of a second or so of the Big Bang.\n\n1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:20.080\n So it could be that one possibility\n\n1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:22.600\n is that the Higgs field is somehow implicated in this,\n\n1:09:22.600 --> 1:09:25.360\n that there was this event that took place\n\n1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:27.680\n in the early universe where the Higgs field\n\n1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:31.400\n basically switched on, it acquired its modern value.\n\n1:09:31.400 --> 1:09:33.480\n And when that happened,\n\n1:09:33.480 --> 1:09:35.600\n this caused all the particles to acquire mass\n\n1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:37.880\n and the universe basically went through a phase transition\n\n1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:41.000\n where you had a hot plasma of massless particles.\n\n1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:42.040\n And then in that plasma,\n\n1:09:42.040 --> 1:09:44.760\n it's almost like a gas turning into droplets of water.\n\n1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:47.960\n You get kind of these little bubbles forming in the universe\n\n1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:50.760\n where the Higgs field has acquired its modern value,\n\n1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:52.280\n the particles have got mass.\n\n1:09:52.280 --> 1:09:55.200\n And this phase transition in some models\n\n1:09:55.200 --> 1:09:57.960\n can cause more matter than antimatter to be produced,\n\n1:09:57.960 --> 1:10:00.640\n depending on how matter bounces off these bubbles\n\n1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:01.760\n in the early universe.\n\n1:10:01.760 --> 1:10:02.760\n So that's one idea.\n\n1:10:02.760 --> 1:10:04.680\n There's other ideas to do with neutrinos,\n\n1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:06.360\n that there are exotic types of neutrinos\n\n1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:09.280\n that can decay in a biased way to just matter\n\n1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:10.200\n and not to antimatter.\n\n1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:12.640\n So, and people are trying to test these ideas.\n\n1:10:12.640 --> 1:10:14.280\n That's what we're trying to do at LHCb.\n\n1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:15.720\n There's neutrino experiments planned\n\n1:10:15.720 --> 1:10:17.560\n that are trying to do these sorts of things as well.\n\n1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:19.560\n So yeah, there are ideas, but at the moment,\n\n1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:22.920\n no clear evidence for which of these ideas might be right.\n\n1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:25.520\n So we're talking about some incredible ideas.\n\n1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:28.320\n By the way, never heard anyone be so eloquent\n\n1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:31.680\n about describing even just the standard model.\n\n1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:34.520\n So I'm in awe just listening.\n\n1:10:34.520 --> 1:10:35.360\n Oh, thank you.\n\n1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:38.080\n Yeah, just having fun enjoying it.\n\n1:10:38.080 --> 1:10:40.280\n So the, yes, the theoretical,\n\n1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:42.520\n the particle physics is fascinating here.\n\n1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:44.680\n To me, one of the most fascinating things\n\n1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:47.880\n about the Large Hadron Collider is the human side of it.\n\n1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:51.520\n That a bunch of sort of brilliant people\n\n1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:54.360\n that probably have egos got together\n\n1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:57.720\n and were collaborate together and countries,\n\n1:10:57.720 --> 1:11:00.000\n I guess, collaborate together for the funds\n\n1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:03.000\n and everything's just collaboration everywhere.\n\n1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:07.440\n Cause you may be, I don't know what the right question here\n\n1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:09.680\n to ask, but almost what's your intuition\n\n1:11:09.680 --> 1:11:11.840\n about how it was possible to make this happen\n\n1:11:11.840 --> 1:11:14.360\n and what are the lessons we should learn\n\n1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:16.080\n for the future of human civilization\n\n1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:17.840\n in terms of our scientific progress?\n\n1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:21.600\n Cause it seems like this is a great, great illustration\n\n1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:24.640\n of us working together to do something big.\n\n1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:27.040\n Yeah, I think it's possibly the best example.\n\n1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:30.280\n Maybe I can think of international collaboration\n\n1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:33.400\n that isn't for some unpleasant purpose, basically.\n\n1:11:33.400 --> 1:11:37.400\n You know, I mean, so when I started out in the field\n\n1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:39.720\n in 2008 as a new PhD student,\n\n1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:41.480\n the LHC was basically finished.\n\n1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:44.600\n So I didn't have to go around asking for money for it\n\n1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:45.520\n or trying to make the case.\n\n1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:48.760\n So I have huge admiration for the people who managed that.\n\n1:11:48.760 --> 1:11:51.160\n Cause this was a project that was first imagined\n\n1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:53.440\n in the 1970s, in the late 70s\n\n1:11:53.440 --> 1:11:56.440\n was when the first conversations about the LHC were mooted\n\n1:11:56.440 --> 1:12:00.800\n and it took two and a half decades of campaigning\n\n1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:03.600\n and fundraising and persuasion\n\n1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:05.200\n until they started breaking ground\n\n1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:08.040\n and building the thing in the early noughties in 2000.\n\n1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:11.280\n So, I mean, I think the reason just from a sort of,\n\n1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:13.280\n from the point of view of the sort of science,\n\n1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:14.120\n the scientists there,\n\n1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:16.680\n I think the reason it works ultimately\n\n1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:19.280\n is that everywhere, everyone there is there\n\n1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:23.680\n for the same reason, which is, well, in principle, at least\n\n1:12:23.680 --> 1:12:25.520\n they're there because they're interested in the world.\n\n1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:27.400\n They want to find out, you know,\n\n1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:29.360\n what are the basic ingredients of our universe?\n\n1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:31.040\n What are the laws of nature?\n\n1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:32.920\n And so everyone is pulling in the same direction.\n\n1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:34.720\n Now, of course, everyone has their own\n\n1:12:34.720 --> 1:12:35.680\n things they're interested in.\n\n1:12:35.680 --> 1:12:37.360\n Everyone has their own careers to consider.\n\n1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:38.800\n And, you know, I wouldn't pretend that\n\n1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:40.760\n there isn't also a lot of competition.\n\n1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:42.880\n So there's this funny thing in these experiments\n\n1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:43.960\n where your collaborators,\n\n1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:46.120\n your 800 collaborators in LHCb,\n\n1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:47.320\n but you're also competitors\n\n1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:49.920\n because your academics in your various universities\n\n1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:51.520\n and you want to be the one that gets the paper out\n\n1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:53.400\n on the most exciting, you know, new measurements.\n\n1:12:53.400 --> 1:12:55.720\n So there's this funny thing where you're kind of trying\n\n1:12:55.720 --> 1:12:58.440\n to stake out your territory while also collaborating\n\n1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:00.920\n and having to work together to make the experiments work.\n\n1:13:00.920 --> 1:13:03.560\n And it does work amazingly well,\n\n1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:05.160\n actually considering all of that.\n\n1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:06.760\n And I think there was actually,\n\n1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:08.680\n I think McKinsey or one of these big management\n\n1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:11.840\n consultancy firms went into CERN maybe a decade or so ago\n\n1:13:11.840 --> 1:13:15.000\n to try to understand how these organizations function.\n\n1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:16.040\n Did they figure it out?\n\n1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:16.960\n I don't think they could.\n\n1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:18.800\n I mean, I think one of the things that's interesting,\n\n1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:19.800\n one of the other interesting things\n\n1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:21.080\n about these experiments is, you know,\n\n1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:24.960\n they're big operations like say Atlas has 3000 people.\n\n1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:26.320\n Now there was a person nominally\n\n1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:29.680\n who was the head of Atlas, they're called the spokesperson.\n\n1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:32.360\n And the spokesperson is elected by,\n\n1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:34.240\n usually by the collaboration,\n\n1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:36.400\n but they have no actual power really.\n\n1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:38.560\n I mean, they can't fire anyone.\n\n1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:39.720\n They're not anyone's boss.\n\n1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:43.360\n So, you know, my boss is a professor at Cambridge,\n\n1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:45.120\n not the head of my experiments.\n\n1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:47.520\n The head of my experiment can't tell me what to do really.\n\n1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:50.200\n And there's all these independent academics\n\n1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:52.400\n who are their own bosses who, you know,\n\n1:13:52.400 --> 1:13:54.600\n so that somehow it, nonetheless,\n\n1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:58.520\n by kind of consensus and discussion and lots of meetings,\n\n1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:01.640\n these things do happen and it does get done, but.\n\n1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:04.960\n It's like the queen here in the UK is the spokesperson.\n\n1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:05.800\n I guess so.\n\n1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:07.560\n No actual power. Except we don't elect her, no.\n\n1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:08.880\n No, we don't elect her.\n\n1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:10.480\n But everybody seems to love her.\n\n1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:13.040\n I don't know, from my outside perspective.\n\n1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:19.840\n But yeah, giant egos, brilliant people.\n\n1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:22.920\n And moving forward, do you think there's.\n\n1:14:22.920 --> 1:14:24.800\n Actually, I would pick up one thing you said just there,\n\n1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:25.840\n just the brilliant people thing.\n\n1:14:25.840 --> 1:14:28.240\n Cause I'm not saying that people aren't great.\n\n1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:30.600\n But I think there is this sort of impression\n\n1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:32.960\n that physicists all have to be brilliant or geniuses,\n\n1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:34.160\n which is not true actually.\n\n1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:37.520\n And you know, you have to be relatively bright for sure.\n\n1:14:37.520 --> 1:14:39.120\n But you know, a lot of people,\n\n1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:41.560\n a lot of the most successful experimental physicists\n\n1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:43.960\n are not necessarily the people with the biggest brains.\n\n1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:45.680\n They're the people who, you know,\n\n1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:47.440\n particularly one of the skills that's most important\n\n1:14:47.440 --> 1:14:49.560\n in particle physics is the ability to work\n\n1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:51.320\n with others and to collaborate and exchange ideas\n\n1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:52.360\n and also to work hard.\n\n1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:55.520\n And it's a sort of, often it's more a determination\n\n1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:57.520\n or a sort of other set of skills.\n\n1:14:57.520 --> 1:15:00.320\n It's not just being, you know, kind of some great brain.\n\n1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:02.280\n Very true.\n\n1:15:02.280 --> 1:15:04.160\n So, I mean, there's parallels to that\n\n1:15:04.160 --> 1:15:05.160\n in the machine learning world.\n\n1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:08.200\n If you wanna solve any real world problems,\n\n1:15:08.200 --> 1:15:11.200\n which I see as the particle accelerators,\n\n1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:14.920\n essentially a real world instantiation\n\n1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:16.720\n of theoretical physics.\n\n1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:20.280\n And for that, you have to not necessarily be brilliant,\n\n1:15:20.280 --> 1:15:25.280\n but be sort of obsessed, systematic, rigorous,\n\n1:15:26.320 --> 1:15:29.840\n sort of unborable, stubborn, all those kind of qualities\n\n1:15:29.840 --> 1:15:31.160\n that make for a great engineer.\n\n1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:34.200\n So, scientists purely speaking,\n\n1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:36.200\n that practitioner of the scientific method.\n\n1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:37.400\n So you're right.\n\n1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:39.800\n But nevertheless, to me that's brilliant.\n\n1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:41.600\n My dad's a physicist.\n\n1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:43.040\n I argue with him all the time.\n\n1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:46.000\n To me, engineering is the highest form of science.\n\n1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.360\n And he thinks that's all nonsense,\n\n1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:50.640\n that the real work is done by the theoretician.\n\n1:15:50.640 --> 1:15:54.320\n So, in fact, we have arguments about like people\n\n1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:56.080\n like Elon Musk, for example,\n\n1:15:56.080 --> 1:15:58.640\n because I think his work is quite brilliant,\n\n1:15:58.640 --> 1:16:00.520\n but he's fundamentally not coming up\n\n1:16:00.520 --> 1:16:02.480\n with any serious breakthroughs.\n\n1:16:02.480 --> 1:16:07.080\n He's just creating in this world, implementing,\n\n1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:09.640\n like making ideas happen that have a huge impact.\n\n1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:12.200\n To me, that's the Edison.\n\n1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:17.200\n That to me is a brilliant work,\n\n1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:22.400\n but to him, it's messy details\n\n1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:25.440\n that somebody will figure out anyway.\n\n1:16:25.440 --> 1:16:26.640\n I mean, I don't know whether you think\n\n1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:29.000\n there is a actual difference in temperament\n\n1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.160\n between say a physicist and an engineer,\n\n1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:33.000\n whether it's just what you got interested in.\n\n1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:34.240\n I don't know.\n\n1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:37.920\n I mean, a lot of what experimental physicists do\n\n1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:40.040\n is to some extent engineering.\n\n1:16:40.040 --> 1:16:40.880\n I mean, it's not what I do.\n\n1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:42.120\n I mostly do data stuff,\n\n1:16:42.120 --> 1:16:45.520\n but a lot of people would be called electrical engineers,\n\n1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:46.960\n but they trained as physicists,\n\n1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:48.880\n but they learned electrical engineering, for example,\n\n1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:50.960\n because they were building detectors.\n\n1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:52.880\n So, there's not such a clear divide, I think.\n\n1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:53.720\n Yeah, it's interesting.\n\n1:16:53.720 --> 1:16:55.600\n I mean, but there does seem to be,\n\n1:16:55.600 --> 1:16:57.120\n like you work with data.\n\n1:16:57.120 --> 1:16:59.920\n There does seem to be a certain,\n\n1:16:59.920 --> 1:17:01.640\n like I love data collection.\n\n1:17:01.640 --> 1:17:03.680\n There might be an OCD element or something\n\n1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:06.600\n that you're more naturally predisposed to\n\n1:17:06.600 --> 1:17:07.600\n as opposed to theory.\n\n1:17:07.600 --> 1:17:08.880\n Like I'm not afraid of data.\n\n1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:10.160\n I love data.\n\n1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:11.680\n And there's a lot of people in machine learning\n\n1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:14.360\n who are more like,\n\n1:17:14.360 --> 1:17:16.920\n they're basically afraid of data collection,\n\n1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:18.880\n afraid of data sets, afraid of all of that.\n\n1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:20.720\n They just want to stay in more than theoretical\n\n1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:22.800\n and they're really good at it, space.\n\n1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:24.040\n So, I don't know if that's the genetic,\n\n1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:28.280\n that's your upbringing, the way you go to school,\n\n1:17:28.280 --> 1:17:33.280\n but looking into the future of LHC and other colliders.\n\n1:17:33.400 --> 1:17:35.320\n So, there's in America,\n\n1:17:35.320 --> 1:17:37.520\n there's whatever it was called, the super,\n\n1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:38.360\n there's a lot of super.\n\n1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:39.840\n Superconducting super colliders.\n\n1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:40.840\n Yeah, superconducting.\n\n1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:41.880\n The desertron, yeah.\n\n1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:43.000\n Desertron, yeah.\n\n1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:45.880\n So, that was canceled, the construction of that.\n\n1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:46.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:50.880\n Which is a sad thing,\n\n1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:54.160\n but what do you think is the future of these efforts?\n\n1:17:54.160 --> 1:17:56.480\n Will a bigger collider be built?\n\n1:17:56.480 --> 1:17:58.560\n Will LHC be expanded?\n\n1:17:58.560 --> 1:17:59.920\n What do you think?\n\n1:17:59.920 --> 1:18:03.360\n Well, in the near future, the LHC is gonna get an upgrade.\n\n1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:04.840\n So, that's pretty much confirmed.\n\n1:18:04.840 --> 1:18:07.160\n I think it is confirmed, which is,\n\n1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:08.160\n it's not an energy upgrade.\n\n1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:10.200\n It's what we call a luminosity upgrade.\n\n1:18:10.200 --> 1:18:11.680\n So, it basically means increasing\n\n1:18:11.680 --> 1:18:13.400\n the data collection rates.\n\n1:18:13.400 --> 1:18:15.920\n So, more collisions per second, basically,\n\n1:18:15.920 --> 1:18:18.160\n because after a few years of data taking,\n\n1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:19.560\n you get this law of diminishing returns\n\n1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:20.680\n where each year's worth of data\n\n1:18:20.680 --> 1:18:21.960\n is a smaller and smaller fraction\n\n1:18:21.960 --> 1:18:23.440\n of the lot you've already got.\n\n1:18:23.440 --> 1:18:25.840\n So, to get a real improvement in sensitivity,\n\n1:18:25.840 --> 1:18:27.200\n you need to increase the data rate\n\n1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:28.280\n by an order of magnitude.\n\n1:18:28.280 --> 1:18:30.520\n So, that's what this upgrade is gonna do.\n\n1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:32.680\n LHCb, at the moment, the whole detector\n\n1:18:32.680 --> 1:18:36.240\n is basically being rebuilt to allow it to record data\n\n1:18:36.240 --> 1:18:38.000\n at a much larger rate than we could before.\n\n1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:39.240\n So, that will make us sensitive\n\n1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:40.680\n to whole loads of new processes\n\n1:18:40.680 --> 1:18:42.200\n that we weren't able to study before.\n\n1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:45.760\n And I mentioned briefly these anomalies that we've seen.\n\n1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:49.040\n So, we've seen a bunch of very intriguing anomalies\n\n1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:51.400\n in these b quark decays,\n\n1:18:52.320 --> 1:18:55.480\n which may be hinting at the first signs\n\n1:18:55.480 --> 1:18:57.360\n of this kind of the elephant,\n\n1:18:57.360 --> 1:18:59.640\n the signs of some new quantum field\n\n1:18:59.640 --> 1:19:01.200\n or fields maybe beyond the standard model.\n\n1:19:01.200 --> 1:19:02.920\n It's not yet at the statistical threshold\n\n1:19:02.920 --> 1:19:06.200\n where you can say that you've observed something,\n\n1:19:06.200 --> 1:19:08.840\n but there's lots of anomalies in many measurements\n\n1:19:08.840 --> 1:19:11.040\n that all seem to be consistent with each other.\n\n1:19:11.040 --> 1:19:12.000\n So, it's quite interesting.\n\n1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:13.600\n So, the upgrade will allow us\n\n1:19:13.600 --> 1:19:15.840\n to really home in on these things\n\n1:19:15.840 --> 1:19:17.360\n and see whether these anomalies are real,\n\n1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:19.480\n because if they are real,\n\n1:19:19.480 --> 1:19:20.880\n and this kind of connects to your point\n\n1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:23.720\n about the next generation of machines,\n\n1:19:23.720 --> 1:19:26.320\n what we would have seen then is,\n\n1:19:26.320 --> 1:19:29.240\n we would have seen the tail end of some quantum field\n\n1:19:29.240 --> 1:19:31.800\n in influencing these b quarks.\n\n1:19:31.800 --> 1:19:34.520\n What we then need to do is to build a bigger collider\n\n1:19:34.520 --> 1:19:37.480\n to actually make the particle of that field.\n\n1:19:37.480 --> 1:19:40.240\n So, if these things really do exist.\n\n1:19:40.240 --> 1:19:41.280\n So, that would be one argument.\n\n1:19:41.280 --> 1:19:42.360\n I mean, so at the moment,\n\n1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:44.000\n Europe is going through this process\n\n1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:47.800\n of thinking about the strategy for the future.\n\n1:19:47.800 --> 1:19:49.720\n So, there are a number of different proposals on the table.\n\n1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:53.600\n One is for a sort of higher energy upgrade of the LHC,\n\n1:19:53.600 --> 1:19:55.280\n where you just build more powerful magnets\n\n1:19:55.280 --> 1:19:56.200\n and put them in the same tunnel.\n\n1:19:56.200 --> 1:19:59.680\n That's a sort of cheaper, less ambitious possibility.\n\n1:19:59.680 --> 1:20:00.840\n Most people don't really like it\n\n1:20:00.840 --> 1:20:02.560\n because it's sort of a bit of a dead end,\n\n1:20:02.560 --> 1:20:05.560\n because once you've done that, there's nowhere to go.\n\n1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:06.840\n There's a machine called Click,\n\n1:20:06.840 --> 1:20:08.960\n which is a compact linear collider,\n\n1:20:08.960 --> 1:20:10.720\n which is a electron positron collider\n\n1:20:10.720 --> 1:20:13.440\n that uses a novel type of acceleration technology\n\n1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:15.520\n to accelerate at shorter distances.\n\n1:20:15.520 --> 1:20:17.000\n We're still talking kilometers long,\n\n1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:19.880\n but not like 100 kilometers long.\n\n1:20:19.880 --> 1:20:22.480\n And then probably the project that is,\n\n1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:23.920\n I think getting the most support,\n\n1:20:23.920 --> 1:20:25.400\n it'd be interesting to see what happens,\n\n1:20:25.400 --> 1:20:28.040\n something called the Future Circular Collider,\n\n1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:32.040\n which is a really ambitious longterm multi decade project\n\n1:20:32.040 --> 1:20:35.960\n to build a 100 kilometer circumference tunnel\n\n1:20:35.960 --> 1:20:38.160\n under the Geneva region.\n\n1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:40.720\n The LHC would become a kind of feeding machine.\n\n1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:41.560\n It would just feed.\n\n1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:44.080\n So the same area, so it would be a feeder for the.\n\n1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:44.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:44.920 --> 1:20:46.400\n So it would kind of, the edge of this machine\n\n1:20:46.400 --> 1:20:47.640\n would be where the LHC is,\n\n1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:49.120\n but it would sort of go under Lake Geneva\n\n1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:51.560\n and round to the Alps, basically,\n\n1:20:51.560 --> 1:20:52.920\n up to the edge of the Geneva basin.\n\n1:20:52.920 --> 1:20:55.560\n So it's basically the biggest tunnel you can fit\n\n1:20:55.560 --> 1:20:57.240\n in the region based on the geology.\n\n1:20:57.240 --> 1:20:58.080\n 100 kilometers.\n\n1:20:58.080 --> 1:20:58.920\n Yeah, so it's big.\n\n1:20:58.920 --> 1:21:01.880\n It'd be a long drive if your experiment's on one side.\n\n1:21:01.880 --> 1:21:03.080\n You've got to go back to CERN for lunch,\n\n1:21:03.080 --> 1:21:04.280\n so that would be a pain.\n\n1:21:04.280 --> 1:21:07.600\n But you know, so this project is,\n\n1:21:07.600 --> 1:21:09.120\n in principle, it's actually two accelerators.\n\n1:21:09.120 --> 1:21:09.960\n The first thing you would do\n\n1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:11.720\n is put an electron positron machine\n\n1:21:11.720 --> 1:21:14.360\n in the 100 kilometer tunnel to study the Higgs.\n\n1:21:14.360 --> 1:21:15.440\n So you'd make lots of Higgs bows\n\n1:21:15.440 --> 1:21:16.960\n and study it really precisely\n\n1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:18.600\n in the hope that you see it misbehaving\n\n1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:20.480\n and doing something it's not supposed to.\n\n1:21:20.480 --> 1:21:22.880\n And then in the much longer term,\n\n1:21:22.880 --> 1:21:24.840\n 100, that machine gets taken out,\n\n1:21:24.840 --> 1:21:26.520\n you put in a proton proton machine.\n\n1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:29.040\n So it's like the LHC, but much bigger.\n\n1:21:29.040 --> 1:21:30.440\n And that's the way you start going\n\n1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:32.400\n and looking for dark matter,\n\n1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:35.960\n or you're trying to recreate this phase transition\n\n1:21:35.960 --> 1:21:37.120\n that I talked about in the early universe,\n\n1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:39.360\n where you can see matter anti matter being made,\n\n1:21:39.360 --> 1:21:40.200\n for example.\n\n1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:41.080\n There's lots of things you can do with these machines.\n\n1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:43.560\n The problem is that they will take,\n\n1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:45.440\n you know, the most optimistic,\n\n1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:46.720\n you're not gonna have any data\n\n1:21:46.720 --> 1:21:49.080\n from any of these machines until 2040,\n\n1:21:49.080 --> 1:21:51.840\n or, you know, because they take such a long time to build\n\n1:21:51.840 --> 1:21:52.920\n and they're so expensive.\n\n1:21:52.920 --> 1:21:55.960\n So you have, there'll be a process of R&D design,\n\n1:21:55.960 --> 1:21:57.960\n but also the political case being made.\n\n1:21:57.960 --> 1:22:01.280\n So LHC, what costs a few billion?\n\n1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:03.200\n Depends how you count it.\n\n1:22:03.200 --> 1:22:05.440\n I think most of the sort of more reasonable estimates\n\n1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:07.000\n that take everything into account properly,\n\n1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:10.400\n it's around the sort of 10, 11, 12 billion euro mark.\n\n1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:12.400\n What would be the future, sorry,\n\n1:22:12.400 --> 1:22:13.240\n I forgot the name already.\n\n1:22:13.240 --> 1:22:14.720\n Future Circular Collider.\n\n1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:15.560\n Future Circular Collider.\n\n1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:16.920\n Presumably they won't call it that when it's built,\n\n1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:18.280\n cause it won't be the future anymore.\n\n1:22:18.280 --> 1:22:20.680\n But I don't know, I don't know what they'll call it then.\n\n1:22:20.680 --> 1:22:25.120\n The very big Hadron Collider, I don't know.\n\n1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:28.840\n But that will, now I should know the numbers,\n\n1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:31.160\n but I think the whole project is estimated\n\n1:22:31.160 --> 1:22:32.880\n at about 30 billion euros,\n\n1:22:32.880 --> 1:22:37.840\n but that's money spent over between now and 2070 probably,\n\n1:22:37.840 --> 1:22:39.840\n which is when the last bit of it\n\n1:22:39.840 --> 1:22:42.360\n would be sort of finishing up, I guess.\n\n1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:46.560\n So you're talking a half a century of science\n\n1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:48.720\n coming out of this thing, shared by many countries.\n\n1:22:48.720 --> 1:22:51.200\n So the actual cost, the arguments that are made\n\n1:22:51.200 --> 1:22:53.120\n is that you could make this project fit\n\n1:22:53.120 --> 1:22:56.160\n within the existing budget of CERN,\n\n1:22:56.160 --> 1:22:57.480\n if you didn't do anything else.\n\n1:22:57.480 --> 1:23:00.520\n And CERN, by the way, we didn't mention, what is CERN?\n\n1:23:00.520 --> 1:23:03.280\n CERN is the European Organization for Nuclear Research.\n\n1:23:03.280 --> 1:23:05.240\n It's an international organization\n\n1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:07.080\n that was established in the 1950s\n\n1:23:07.080 --> 1:23:10.280\n in the wake of the second world war as a kind of,\n\n1:23:10.280 --> 1:23:12.520\n it was sort of like a scientific Marshall plan for Europe.\n\n1:23:12.520 --> 1:23:16.080\n The idea was that you bring European science back together\n\n1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:17.320\n for peaceful purposes,\n\n1:23:17.320 --> 1:23:20.000\n because what happened in the forties was,\n\n1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:21.280\n a lot of particular Jewish scientists,\n\n1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:22.640\n but a lot of scientists from central Europe\n\n1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:25.000\n had fled to the United States\n\n1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:27.240\n and Europe had sort of seen this brain drain.\n\n1:23:27.240 --> 1:23:29.920\n So there was a desire to bring the community back together\n\n1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:32.280\n for a project that wasn't building nasty bombs,\n\n1:23:32.280 --> 1:23:34.280\n but was doing something that was curiosity driven.\n\n1:23:34.280 --> 1:23:37.320\n So, and that has continued since then.\n\n1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:38.840\n So it's kind of a unique organization.\n\n1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:41.480\n It's you, to be a member as a country,\n\n1:23:41.480 --> 1:23:43.040\n you sort of sign up as a member\n\n1:23:43.040 --> 1:23:45.960\n and then you have to pay a fraction of your GDP\n\n1:23:45.960 --> 1:23:47.360\n each year as a subscription.\n\n1:23:47.360 --> 1:23:49.520\n I mean, it's a very small fraction, relatively speaking.\n\n1:23:49.520 --> 1:23:51.480\n I think it's like, I think the UK's contribution\n\n1:23:51.480 --> 1:23:54.840\n is a hundred or 200 million quid or something like that.\n\n1:23:54.840 --> 1:23:57.480\n Yeah, which is quite a lot, but not so.\n\n1:23:57.480 --> 1:23:58.400\n That's fascinating.\n\n1:23:58.400 --> 1:24:00.040\n I mean, just the whole thing that is possible,\n\n1:24:00.040 --> 1:24:01.240\n it's beautiful.\n\n1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:02.240\n It's a beautiful idea,\n\n1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:05.320\n especially when there's no wars on the line,\n\n1:24:05.320 --> 1:24:06.560\n it's not like we're freaking out,\n\n1:24:06.560 --> 1:24:08.880\n as we're actually legitimately collaborating\n\n1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:09.880\n to do good science.\n\n1:24:09.880 --> 1:24:11.880\n One of the things I don't think we really mentioned\n\n1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:15.360\n is on the final side, that sort of the data analysis side,\n\n1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:17.080\n is there breakthroughs possible there\n\n1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:18.160\n and the machine learning side,\n\n1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:22.680\n like is there a lot more signal to be mined\n\n1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:25.400\n in more effective ways from the actual raw data?\n\n1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:27.680\n Yeah, a lot of people are looking into that.\n\n1:24:27.680 --> 1:24:31.600\n I mean, so I use machine learning in my data analysis,\n\n1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:33.840\n but pretty naughty, basic stuff,\n\n1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:35.440\n cause I'm not a machine learning expert.\n\n1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:37.960\n I'm just a physicist who had to learn to do this stuff\n\n1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:38.800\n for my day job.\n\n1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:40.600\n So what a lot of people do is they use\n\n1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:42.560\n kind of off the shelf packages\n\n1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:46.240\n that you can train to do signal noise.\n\n1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:48.280\n Just clean up all the data.\n\n1:24:48.280 --> 1:24:50.040\n But one of the big challenges,\n\n1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:52.720\n the big challenge of the data is A, it's volume,\n\n1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:53.880\n there's huge amounts of data.\n\n1:24:53.880 --> 1:24:56.480\n So the LHC generates, now, okay,\n\n1:24:56.480 --> 1:24:57.920\n I try to remember what the actual numbers are,\n\n1:24:57.920 --> 1:24:59.440\n but if you, we don't record all our data,\n\n1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:02.240\n we record a tiny fraction of the data.\n\n1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:04.920\n It's like of order one 10,000th or something, I think.\n\n1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:05.880\n Is that right?\n\n1:25:05.880 --> 1:25:07.040\n Around that.\n\n1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:08.600\n So most of it gets thrown away.\n\n1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:10.080\n You couldn't record all the LHC data\n\n1:25:10.080 --> 1:25:11.480\n cause it would fill up every computer in the world\n\n1:25:11.480 --> 1:25:13.680\n in a matter of days, basically.\n\n1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:17.000\n So there's this process that happens on live,\n\n1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:18.880\n on the detector, something called a trigger,\n\n1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:21.360\n which in real time, 40 million times every second\n\n1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:23.680\n has to make a decision about whether this collision\n\n1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:26.400\n is likely to contain an interesting object,\n\n1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:28.560\n like a Higgs boson or a dark matter particle.\n\n1:25:28.560 --> 1:25:29.760\n And it has to do that very fast.\n\n1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:33.240\n And the software algorithms in the past\n\n1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:36.040\n were quite relatively basic.\n\n1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:37.840\n They did things like measure mementos\n\n1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:40.320\n and energies of particles and put some requirements.\n\n1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:42.200\n So you would say, if there's a particle\n\n1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:43.640\n with an energy above some threshold,\n\n1:25:43.640 --> 1:25:44.840\n then record this collision.\n\n1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:46.240\n But if there isn't, don't.\n\n1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:47.960\n Whereas now the attempt is get more and more\n\n1:25:47.960 --> 1:25:51.080\n machine learning in at the earliest possible stage.\n\n1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:53.160\n That's cool, at the stage of deciding\n\n1:25:53.160 --> 1:25:55.280\n whether we want to keep this data or not.\n\n1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:57.640\n But also maybe even lower down than that,\n\n1:25:57.640 --> 1:26:01.160\n which is the point where there's this,\n\n1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:02.800\n so generally how the data is reconstructed\n\n1:26:02.800 --> 1:26:06.280\n is you start off with a set of digital hits\n\n1:26:06.280 --> 1:26:07.120\n in your detector.\n\n1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:08.840\n So channels saying, did you see something?\n\n1:26:08.840 --> 1:26:10.120\n Did you not see something?\n\n1:26:10.120 --> 1:26:12.560\n That has to be then turned into tracks,\n\n1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:14.040\n particles going in different directions.\n\n1:26:14.040 --> 1:26:15.520\n And that's done by using fits\n\n1:26:15.520 --> 1:26:17.200\n that fit through the data points.\n\n1:26:17.200 --> 1:26:18.640\n And then that's passed to the algorithms\n\n1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:20.520\n that then go, is this interesting or not?\n\n1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:22.520\n What'd be better is you could train machine learning\n\n1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:24.120\n to just look at the raw hits,\n\n1:26:24.120 --> 1:26:26.360\n the basic real base level information,\n\n1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:28.440\n not have any of the reconstruction done.\n\n1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:31.040\n And it just goes, and it can learn to do pattern recognition\n\n1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:34.240\n on this strange three dimensional image that you get.\n\n1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:36.800\n And potentially that's where you could get really big gains\n\n1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:38.760\n because our triggers tend to be quite inefficient\n\n1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:41.880\n because they don't have time to do\n\n1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:43.360\n the full whiz bang processing\n\n1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:45.400\n to get all the information out that we would like,\n\n1:26:45.400 --> 1:26:46.760\n because you have to do the decision very quickly.\n\n1:26:46.760 --> 1:26:48.760\n So if you can come up with some clever\n\n1:26:48.760 --> 1:26:50.080\n machine learning technique,\n\n1:26:50.080 --> 1:26:52.000\n then potentially you can massively increase\n\n1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.960\n the amount of useful data you record\n\n1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:58.400\n and get rid of more of the background\n\n1:26:58.400 --> 1:26:59.800\n earlier in the process.\n\n1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:01.440\n Yeah, to me, that's an exciting possibility\n\n1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:04.880\n because then you don't have to build a sort of,\n\n1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:07.200\n you can get a gain without having to.\n\n1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:10.360\n Without having to build any hardware, I suppose.\n\n1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:11.200\n Hardware, yeah.\n\n1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:13.960\n Although you need lots of new GPU farms, I guess.\n\n1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:15.280\n So hardware still helps.\n\n1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:20.280\n But I got to talk to you,\n\n1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:22.840\n sort of I'm not sure how to ask,\n\n1:27:22.840 --> 1:27:27.480\n but you're clearly an incredible science communicator.\n\n1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:29.560\n I don't know if that's the right term,\n\n1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:32.520\n but you're basically a younger Neil deGrasse Tyson\n\n1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:33.680\n with a British accent.\n\n1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:36.480\n So, and you've, I mean,\n\n1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:39.160\n can you say where we are today, actually?\n\n1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:42.560\n Yeah, so today we're in the Royal Institution in London,\n\n1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:45.880\n which is a very old organization.\n\n1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:47.760\n It's been around for about 200 years now, I think.\n\n1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:49.800\n Maybe even I should know when it was founded.\n\n1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:51.440\n Sort of early 19th century,\n\n1:27:51.440 --> 1:27:55.880\n it was set up to basically communicate science to the public.\n\n1:27:55.880 --> 1:27:57.560\n So it was one of the first places in the world\n\n1:27:57.560 --> 1:28:01.240\n where famous scientists would come and give talks.\n\n1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:05.440\n So very famously Humphrey Davy, who you may know of,\n\n1:28:05.440 --> 1:28:07.560\n who was the person who discovered nitrous oxide.\n\n1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:11.200\n He was a very famous chemist and scientist.\n\n1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:12.720\n Also discovered electrolysis.\n\n1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:13.920\n So he used to do these fantastic,\n\n1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:15.040\n he was a very charismatic speaker.\n\n1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:15.880\n So he used to appear here.\n\n1:28:15.880 --> 1:28:18.440\n There's a big desk that they usually have in the theater\n\n1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:21.160\n and he would do demonstrations to the sort of the,\n\n1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:23.760\n the folk of London back in the early 19th century.\n\n1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:25.200\n And Michael Faraday, who I talked about,\n\n1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:27.280\n who is the person who did so much work on electromagnetism,\n\n1:28:27.280 --> 1:28:28.400\n he used, he lectured here.\n\n1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:29.880\n He also did experiments in the basement.\n\n1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:31.240\n So this place has got a long history\n\n1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:33.320\n of both scientific research,\n\n1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:35.800\n but also communication of scientific research.\n\n1:28:35.800 --> 1:28:38.040\n So you gave a few lectures here.\n\n1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:39.320\n How many, two?\n\n1:28:39.320 --> 1:28:41.080\n I've given, yeah, I've given a couple of lectures\n\n1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:42.280\n in this theater before, so.\n\n1:28:42.280 --> 1:28:46.000\n I mean, that's, so people should definitely go watch online.\n\n1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:48.640\n It's just the explanation of particle physics.\n\n1:28:48.640 --> 1:28:50.480\n So all the, I mean, it's incredible.\n\n1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:53.360\n Like your lectures are just incredible.\n\n1:28:53.360 --> 1:28:54.520\n I can't sing it enough praise.\n\n1:28:54.520 --> 1:28:55.480\n So it was awesome.\n\n1:28:55.480 --> 1:29:00.280\n But maybe can you say, what did that feel like?\n\n1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:03.600\n What does it feel like to lecture here, to talk about that?\n\n1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:06.440\n And maybe from a different perspective,\n\n1:29:06.440 --> 1:29:09.360\n more kind of like how the sausage is made is,\n\n1:29:09.360 --> 1:29:12.120\n how do you prepare for that kind of thing?\n\n1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:14.320\n How do you think about communication,\n\n1:29:14.320 --> 1:29:16.440\n the process of communicating these ideas\n\n1:29:16.440 --> 1:29:18.480\n in a way that's inspiring to,\n\n1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:21.200\n what I would say your talks are inspiring\n\n1:29:21.200 --> 1:29:22.560\n to like the general audience.\n\n1:29:22.560 --> 1:29:25.080\n You don't actually have to be a scientist.\n\n1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:28.040\n You can still be inspired without really knowing much of the,\n\n1:29:28.040 --> 1:29:30.720\n you start from the very basics.\n\n1:29:30.720 --> 1:29:33.320\n So what's the preparation process?\n\n1:29:33.320 --> 1:29:34.800\n And then the romantic question is,\n\n1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:38.000\n what did that feel like to perform here?\n\n1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:39.600\n I mean, profession, yeah.\n\n1:29:39.600 --> 1:29:42.200\n I mean, the process, I mean, the talk,\n\n1:29:42.200 --> 1:29:43.280\n my favorite talk that I gave here\n\n1:29:43.280 --> 1:29:44.520\n was one called Beyond the Higgs,\n\n1:29:44.520 --> 1:29:46.800\n which you can find on the Royal Institute's YouTube channel,\n\n1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:48.280\n which you should go and check out.\n\n1:29:48.280 --> 1:29:50.000\n I mean, and their channel's got loads of great talks\n\n1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:51.760\n with loads of great people as well.\n\n1:29:52.760 --> 1:29:55.160\n I mean, that one, I'd sort of given a version of it\n\n1:29:55.160 --> 1:29:57.360\n many times, so part of it is just practice, right?\n\n1:29:57.360 --> 1:29:59.000\n And actually, I don't have some great theory\n\n1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:00.360\n of how to communicate with people.\n\n1:30:00.360 --> 1:30:02.640\n It's more just that I'm really interested\n\n1:30:02.640 --> 1:30:05.240\n and excited by those ideas and I like talking about them.\n\n1:30:05.240 --> 1:30:07.280\n And through the process of doing that,\n\n1:30:07.280 --> 1:30:09.640\n I guess I figured out stories that work\n\n1:30:09.640 --> 1:30:10.840\n and explanations that work.\n\n1:30:10.840 --> 1:30:12.920\n When you say practice, you mean legitimately\n\n1:30:12.920 --> 1:30:14.960\n just giving talks? Just giving talks, yeah.\n\n1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:17.240\n I started off when I was a PhD student\n\n1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:20.040\n doing talks in schools and I still do that as well\n\n1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:21.760\n some of the time and doing things,\n\n1:30:21.760 --> 1:30:23.200\n I've even done a bit of standup comedy,\n\n1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:25.240\n which sort of went reasonably well,\n\n1:30:25.240 --> 1:30:26.280\n even if it was terrifying.\n\n1:30:26.280 --> 1:30:27.480\n And that's on YouTube as well.\n\n1:30:27.480 --> 1:30:29.240\n That's also on, I wouldn't necessarily recommend\n\n1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:30.080\n you check that out.\n\n1:30:30.080 --> 1:30:33.200\n I'm gonna post the links several places\n\n1:30:33.200 --> 1:30:35.400\n to make sure people click on it.\n\n1:30:35.400 --> 1:30:37.760\n But it's basically, I kind of have a story in my head\n\n1:30:37.760 --> 1:30:41.720\n and I kind of, I have to think about what I wanna say.\n\n1:30:41.720 --> 1:30:43.480\n I usually have some images to support what I'm saying\n\n1:30:43.480 --> 1:30:44.440\n and I get up and do it.\n\n1:30:44.440 --> 1:30:47.200\n And it's not really, I wish there was some kind of,\n\n1:30:47.200 --> 1:30:48.640\n I probably should have some proper process.\n\n1:30:48.640 --> 1:30:50.640\n This is very sounds like I'm just making up as I go along\n\n1:30:50.640 --> 1:30:52.200\n and I sort of am.\n\n1:30:52.200 --> 1:30:54.240\n Well, I think the fundamental thing that you said,\n\n1:30:54.240 --> 1:30:58.320\n I think it's like, I don't know if you know\n\n1:30:58.320 --> 1:31:01.120\n who a guy named Joe Rogan is.\n\n1:31:01.120 --> 1:31:02.200\n Yes, I do.\n\n1:31:02.200 --> 1:31:05.040\n So he's also kind of sounds like you in a sense\n\n1:31:05.040 --> 1:31:08.560\n that he's not very introspective about his process,\n\n1:31:08.560 --> 1:31:13.040\n but he's an incredibly engaging conversationalist.\n\n1:31:13.040 --> 1:31:15.800\n And I think one of the things that you and him share\n\n1:31:15.800 --> 1:31:19.920\n that I could see is like a genuine curiosity\n\n1:31:19.920 --> 1:31:22.320\n and passion for the topic.\n\n1:31:22.320 --> 1:31:26.840\n I think that could be systematically cultivated.\n\n1:31:26.840 --> 1:31:28.200\n I'm sure there's a process to it,\n\n1:31:28.200 --> 1:31:30.520\n but you come to it naturally somehow.\n\n1:31:30.520 --> 1:31:31.920\n I think maybe there's something else as well,\n\n1:31:31.920 --> 1:31:34.240\n which is to understand something.\n\n1:31:34.240 --> 1:31:35.920\n There's this quote by Feynman, which I really like,\n\n1:31:35.920 --> 1:31:38.240\n which is what I cannot create, I do not understand.\n\n1:31:38.240 --> 1:31:43.200\n So I'm not particularly super bright.\n\n1:31:43.200 --> 1:31:44.680\n So for me to understand something,\n\n1:31:44.680 --> 1:31:47.240\n I have to break it down into its simplest elements.\n\n1:31:47.240 --> 1:31:49.800\n And if I can then tell people about that,\n\n1:31:49.800 --> 1:31:51.120\n that helps me understand it as well.\n\n1:31:51.120 --> 1:31:55.480\n So I've learned to understand physics a lot more\n\n1:31:55.480 --> 1:31:57.120\n from the process of communicating,\n\n1:31:57.120 --> 1:32:00.640\n because it forces you to really scrutinize the ideas\n\n1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:02.600\n that you're communicating and it often makes you realize\n\n1:32:02.600 --> 1:32:06.000\n you don't really understand the ideas you're talking about.\n\n1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:08.120\n And I'm writing a book at the moment,\n\n1:32:08.120 --> 1:32:09.960\n and I had this experience yesterday where I realized\n\n1:32:09.960 --> 1:32:12.600\n I didn't really understand a pretty fundamental\n\n1:32:12.600 --> 1:32:14.480\n theoretical aspect of my own subject.\n\n1:32:14.480 --> 1:32:15.960\n And I had to go and I had to sort of spend\n\n1:32:15.960 --> 1:32:18.840\n a couple of days reading textbooks and thinking about it\n\n1:32:18.840 --> 1:32:21.760\n in order to make sure that the explanation I gave\n\n1:32:21.760 --> 1:32:24.800\n captured the, got as close to what is actually happening\n\n1:32:24.800 --> 1:32:26.040\n in the theory.\n\n1:32:26.040 --> 1:32:29.040\n And to do that, you have to really understand it properly.\n\n1:32:29.040 --> 1:32:31.040\n Yeah, and there's layers to understanding.\n\n1:32:31.040 --> 1:32:33.720\n It seems like the more,\n\n1:32:33.720 --> 1:32:35.920\n there must be some kind of Feynman law.\n\n1:32:35.920 --> 1:32:39.680\n I mean, the more you understand sort of the simpler\n\n1:32:39.680 --> 1:32:44.680\n you're able to really convey the essence of the idea, right?\n\n1:32:46.080 --> 1:32:51.080\n So it's like this reverse effect that it's like\n\n1:32:52.480 --> 1:32:54.880\n the more you understand, the simpler the final thing\n\n1:32:54.880 --> 1:32:56.280\n that you actually convey.\n\n1:32:56.280 --> 1:32:58.800\n And so the more accessible somehow it becomes.\n\n1:32:58.800 --> 1:33:01.960\n That's why Feynman's lectures are really accessible.\n\n1:33:03.200 --> 1:33:04.880\n It was just counterintuitive.\n\n1:33:04.880 --> 1:33:06.720\n Yeah, although there are some ideas\n\n1:33:06.720 --> 1:33:09.400\n that are very difficult to explain\n\n1:33:09.400 --> 1:33:12.240\n no matter how well or badly you understand them.\n\n1:33:12.240 --> 1:33:15.280\n Like I still can't really properly explain\n\n1:33:15.280 --> 1:33:16.440\n the Higgs mechanism.\n\n1:33:16.440 --> 1:33:17.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:17.400 --> 1:33:19.120\n Because some of these ideas only exist\n\n1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:20.400\n in mathematics really.\n\n1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:24.320\n And the only way to really develop an understanding\n\n1:33:24.320 --> 1:33:29.080\n is to go unfortunately to a graduate degree in physics.\n\n1:33:29.080 --> 1:33:31.880\n But you can get kind of a flavor of what's happening,\n\n1:33:31.880 --> 1:33:33.520\n I think, and it's trying to do that in a way\n\n1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:36.840\n that isn't misleading, but always also intelligible.\n\n1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:39.760\n So let me ask them the romantic question of\n\n1:33:39.760 --> 1:33:44.480\n what to you is the most, perhaps an unfair question,\n\n1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:47.560\n what is the most beautiful idea in physics?\n\n1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:52.680\n One that fills you with awe is the most surprising,\n\n1:33:52.680 --> 1:33:54.760\n the strangest, the weirdest.\n\n1:33:54.760 --> 1:33:57.600\n There's a lot of different definitions of beauty.\n\n1:33:57.600 --> 1:33:59.320\n And I'm sure there's several for you,\n\n1:33:59.320 --> 1:34:01.080\n but is there something that just jumps to mind\n\n1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:04.520\n that you think is just especially beautiful?\n\n1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:08.760\n There's a specific thing and a more general thing.\n\n1:34:08.760 --> 1:34:10.040\n So maybe the specific thing first,\n\n1:34:10.040 --> 1:34:12.400\n which I can now first came across as an undergraduate.\n\n1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:13.440\n I found this amazing.\n\n1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:17.120\n So this idea that the forces of nature,\n\n1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:19.960\n electromagnetism, strong force, the weak force,\n\n1:34:19.960 --> 1:34:24.720\n they arise in our theories as a consequence of symmetries.\n\n1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:27.480\n So symmetries in the laws of nature,\n\n1:34:27.480 --> 1:34:29.000\n in the equations essentially\n\n1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:31.040\n that used to describe these ideas,\n\n1:34:32.080 --> 1:34:34.440\n the process whereby theories come up\n\n1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:36.600\n with these sorts of models is they say,\n\n1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:39.920\n imagine the universe obeys this particular type of symmetry.\n\n1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:42.240\n It's a symmetry that isn't so far removed\n\n1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:44.880\n from a geometrical symmetry, like the rotations of a cube.\n\n1:34:44.880 --> 1:34:46.360\n It's not, you can't think of it quite that way,\n\n1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:49.040\n but it's sort of a similar sort of idea.\n\n1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:51.880\n And you say, okay, if the universe respects the symmetry,\n\n1:34:51.880 --> 1:34:54.720\n you find that you have to introduce a force\n\n1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:57.960\n which has the properties of electromagnetism\n\n1:34:57.960 --> 1:35:00.080\n or a different symmetry, you get the strong force\n\n1:35:00.080 --> 1:35:01.800\n or a different symmetry, you get the weak force.\n\n1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:05.160\n So these interactions seem to come from some deeper,\n\n1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:06.280\n it suggests that they come\n\n1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:07.960\n from some deeper symmetry principle.\n\n1:35:07.960 --> 1:35:09.680\n I mean, it depends a bit how you look at it\n\n1:35:09.680 --> 1:35:10.720\n because it could be that we're actually\n\n1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:12.800\n just recognizing symmetries in the things that we see,\n\n1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:15.160\n but there's something rather lovely about that.\n\n1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:17.080\n But I mean, I suppose a bigger thing that makes me wonder\n\n1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:20.200\n is actually, if you look at the laws of nature,\n\n1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:22.680\n how particles interact when you get really close down,\n\n1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:24.240\n they're basically pretty simple things.\n\n1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:26.360\n They bounce off each other by exchanging\n\n1:35:26.360 --> 1:35:27.840\n through force fields and they move around\n\n1:35:27.840 --> 1:35:29.280\n in very simple ways.\n\n1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:31.880\n And somehow these basic ingredients,\n\n1:35:31.880 --> 1:35:34.560\n these few particles that we know about in the forces\n\n1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:37.360\n creates this universe, which is unbelievably complicated\n\n1:35:37.360 --> 1:35:39.520\n and has things like you and me in it,\n\n1:35:39.520 --> 1:35:43.400\n and the earth and stars that make matter in their cores\n\n1:35:43.400 --> 1:35:46.160\n from the gravitational energy of their own bulk\n\n1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:47.600\n that then gets sprayed into the universe\n\n1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:48.480\n that forms other things.\n\n1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:52.880\n I mean, the fact that there's this incredibly long story\n\n1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:55.920\n that goes right back to the beginning,\n\n1:35:55.920 --> 1:35:58.240\n and we can take this story right back to a trillionth\n\n1:35:58.240 --> 1:35:59.440\n of a second after the Big Bang,\n\n1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:01.280\n and we can trace the origins of the stuff\n\n1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:02.440\n that we're made from.\n\n1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:05.040\n And it all ultimately comes from these simple ingredients\n\n1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:06.560\n with these simple rules.\n\n1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:08.720\n And the fact you can generate such complexity from that\n\n1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:11.080\n is really mysterious, I think, and strange.\n\n1:36:11.080 --> 1:36:12.920\n And it's not even a question that physicists\n\n1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:15.760\n can really tackle because we are sort of trying\n\n1:36:15.760 --> 1:36:19.080\n to find these really elementary laws.\n\n1:36:19.080 --> 1:36:21.880\n But it turns out that going from elementary laws\n\n1:36:21.880 --> 1:36:24.040\n and a few particles to something even as complicated\n\n1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:26.600\n as a molecule becomes very difficult.\n\n1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:28.640\n So going from a molecule to a human being\n\n1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:31.960\n is a problem that just can't be tackled,\n\n1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:34.040\n at least not at the moment, so.\n\n1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:37.320\n Yeah, the emergence of complexity from simple rules\n\n1:36:37.320 --> 1:36:40.600\n is so beautiful and so mysterious.\n\n1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:43.600\n And we don't have good mathematics\n\n1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:47.320\n to even try to approach that emergent phenomena.\n\n1:36:47.320 --> 1:36:48.800\n That's why we have chemistry and biology\n\n1:36:48.800 --> 1:36:52.040\n and all the other subjects, yeah, okay.\n\n1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:55.880\n I don't think there's a better way to end it, Harry.\n\n1:36:55.880 --> 1:36:59.040\n I can't, I mean, I think I speak for a lot of people\n\n1:36:59.040 --> 1:37:01.880\n that can't wait to see what happens\n\n1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:03.800\n in the next five, 10, 20 years with you.\n\n1:37:03.800 --> 1:37:06.080\n I think you're one of the great communicators of our time.\n\n1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:09.840\n So I hope you continue that and I hope that grows.\n\n1:37:09.840 --> 1:37:12.280\n And I'm definitely a huge fan.\n\n1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:13.960\n So it was an honor to talk to you today.\n\n1:37:13.960 --> 1:37:14.800\n Thanks so much, man.\n\n1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:16.360\n It was really fun, thanks very much.\n\n1:37:16.360 --> 1:37:19.040\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Harry

1:37:51.160\n You and I are leftovers.\n\n1:37:51.160 --> 1:37:53.760\n Every particle in our bodies is a survivor\n\n1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:57.080\n from an almighty shootout between matter and antimatter\n\n1:37:57.080 --> 1:37:59.360\n that happened a little after the Big Bang.\n\n1:37:59.360 --> 1:38:02.760\n In fact, only one in a billion particles created\n\n1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:06.080\n at the beginning of time have survived to the present day.\n\n1:38:06.080 --> 1:38:18.080\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
