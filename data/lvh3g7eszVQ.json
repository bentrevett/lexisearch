00:07.460\n twice a week or three times per week,\n\n00:07.460 --> 00:09.460\n you reduce the likelihood of dying\n\n00:09.460 --> 00:12.440\n of a cardiovascular event by 27%.\n\n00:12.440 --> 00:14.720\n If you do it four or more times per week,\n\n00:14.720 --> 00:17.960\n you reduce the probability of dying by 50%.\n\n00:17.960 --> 00:19.840\n Is there any scientific evidence\n\n00:19.840 --> 00:22.460\n that being naked is beneficial in the sauna?\n\n00:22.460 --> 00:25.640\n Well, in certain contexts, it leads to childbirth.\n\n00:25.640 --> 00:27.560\n Okay, well, I'll have to read up on that.\n\n00:27.560 --> 00:30.200\n I think Dorothy Parker said,\n\n00:30.200 --> 00:32.520\n the cure for boredom is curiosity.\n\n00:32.520 --> 00:34.400\n There is no cure for curiosity.\n\n00:36.660 --> 00:39.360\n The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman,\n\n00:39.360 --> 00:41.800\n his third time on this podcast.\n\n00:41.800 --> 00:45.240\n He's a brilliant neuroscientist at Stanford University\n\n00:45.240 --> 00:48.180\n and the host of one of the best,\n\n00:49.480 --> 00:51.280\n the best, if you ask me,\n\n00:51.280 --> 00:53.240\n health and science podcasts in the world\n\n00:53.240 --> 00:55.600\n called Huberman Lab Podcast.\n\n00:55.600 --> 00:58.840\n Check him out on Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube.\n\n00:58.840 --> 01:01.920\n Most importantly, Andrew is a great human being\n\n01:01.920 --> 01:05.320\n and has quickly become a great friend.\n\n01:05.320 --> 01:07.380\n This is the Lex Riebman Podcast.\n\n01:07.380 --> 01:09.520\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:09.520 --> 01:10.800\n in the description.\n\n01:10.800 --> 01:14.780\n And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Huberman.\n\n01:15.680 --> 01:17.600\n We meet again, my friend.\n\n01:17.600 --> 01:19.760\n We should talk on each other's podcast once a year.\n\n01:19.760 --> 01:21.520\n I think we should make a deal.\n\n01:21.520 --> 01:23.040\n I was just talking to the guys,\n\n01:23.040 --> 01:25.560\n this is a show called Louie, I don't know if you know it.\n\n01:25.560 --> 01:27.680\n And yeah, with Louie CK.\n\n01:27.680 --> 01:30.320\n And there's this thing called Bang Bang,\n\n01:30.320 --> 01:31.640\n which people that are probably watching\n\n01:31.640 --> 01:33.520\n know exactly what I'm talking about.\n\n01:33.520 --> 01:35.520\n It's this worst possible thing you can do\n\n01:35.520 --> 01:39.000\n in terms of meals, which is you go to a restaurant,\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:42.480\n do a full meal, and then you go to another restaurant\n\n01:42.480 --> 01:44.240\n and do a full meal and you pet me.\n\n01:44.240 --> 01:46.480\n You, exactly.\n\n01:46.480 --> 01:51.040\n So they go Mexican, Italian, sushi, pizza, barbecue,\n\n01:51.040 --> 01:52.960\n IHOP, that one is disgusting.\n\n01:52.960 --> 01:57.880\n This kind of thing reminds me of the joy of food.\n\n01:57.880 --> 01:59.740\n Last time we were hanging out,\n\n01:59.740 --> 02:01.920\n we went to see Joe Do Comedy\n\n02:01.920 --> 02:04.680\n and then we went to eat Russian food.\n\n02:04.680 --> 02:08.480\n And it was a particularly fun experience\n\n02:08.480 --> 02:10.880\n to go to a Russian restaurant.\n\n02:10.880 --> 02:14.380\n I was the only person there that didn't speak Russian\n\n02:14.380 --> 02:16.260\n and eat Russian food with you.\n\n02:16.260 --> 02:20.460\n And because I felt walking in, they trusted you.\n\n02:20.460 --> 02:21.840\n They didn't trust me.\n\n02:21.840 --> 02:24.800\n Yeah, the funny thing about the people there,\n\n02:24.800 --> 02:26.640\n they were talking to you in Russian\n\n02:26.640 --> 02:29.160\n and then they refused to sort of switch to English,\n\n02:29.160 --> 02:31.280\n even though they understood you speak no Russian.\n\n02:31.280 --> 02:34.080\n This is Russian House in Austin, by the way.\n\n02:34.080 --> 02:38.120\n Anyway, by way of question, what's the worst or the best,\n\n02:38.120 --> 02:40.160\n depending on your perspective, cheap meal?\n\n02:40.160 --> 02:41.560\n Let's call it a pigging out meal,\n\n02:41.560 --> 02:45.220\n but it could be a cheap meal that you've ever had\n\n02:45.220 --> 02:48.640\n or you want to have that's like on the bucket list\n\n02:48.640 --> 02:50.120\n or something that's in the past,\n\n02:50.120 --> 02:52.360\n where you did something like a Bang Bang,\n\n02:52.360 --> 02:54.160\n which is like, you're talking about\n\n02:54.160 --> 02:56.840\n multiple thousands of calories\n\n02:56.840 --> 02:59.120\n that you just feel horrible about yourself\n\n02:59.120 --> 03:01.600\n but you still keep eating because it's delicious,\n\n03:01.600 --> 03:04.000\n but also great company.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:07.360\n Something about the atmosphere is just right.\n\n03:07.360 --> 03:09.600\n Screw the diet, screw all the things,\n\n03:11.360 --> 03:12.480\n like you should be doing,\n\n03:12.480 --> 03:14.540\n but just throw it all out the window.\n\n03:14.540 --> 03:16.980\n I've done that several times.\n\n03:16.980 --> 03:18.160\n Yeah, I don't do this anymore,\n\n03:18.160 --> 03:21.280\n but the entire time I was a postdoc, so five years,\n\n03:21.280 --> 03:23.660\n and the entire time I was a pretenured professor,\n\n03:23.660 --> 03:27.460\n so five years, so I basically followed\n\n03:27.460 --> 03:29.680\n the Tim Ferriss slow carb diet,\n\n03:29.680 --> 03:32.960\n which is, people can look it up, but it worked really well.\n\n03:32.960 --> 03:37.480\n It was basically some good animal proteins,\n\n03:37.480 --> 03:38.680\n fish and meat and things like that.\n\n03:38.680 --> 03:39.520\n Why slow carb?\n\n03:39.520 --> 03:41.620\n Because slow carb is like low glycemic stuff,\n\n03:41.620 --> 03:44.480\n it's mostly lentils and beans and things and vegetables,\n\n03:44.480 --> 03:48.440\n no dairy, no, anyway, but then one day.\n\n03:48.440 --> 03:49.280\n Is pasta in there?\n\n03:49.280 --> 03:50.120\n Sorry to interrupt.\n\n03:50.120 --> 03:51.200\n No, no pasta.\n\n03:51.200 --> 03:53.600\n So it wasn't low carb, but it was low glycemic carb.\n\n03:53.600 --> 03:55.280\n And I did that and it worked terrifically well\n\n03:55.280 --> 03:56.320\n just for energy levels,\n\n03:56.320 --> 03:57.400\n cause I want to be able to train and work.\n\n03:57.400 --> 03:58.880\n And then one day a week,\n\n03:58.880 --> 04:02.760\n you're supposed to go full cheat day.\n\n04:02.760 --> 04:05.400\n And so I would do what used to be 12 hours,\n\n04:05.400 --> 04:07.200\n but then it became 24,\n\n04:07.200 --> 04:09.800\n you can start to redefine what the day is.\n\n04:09.800 --> 04:13.800\n And I would, and that was when Costello was pretty young\n\n04:13.800 --> 04:14.920\n and we would do it together.\n\n04:14.920 --> 04:18.100\n So I would get pizzas and croissants and donuts,\n\n04:18.100 --> 04:20.060\n and I would just do the full thing.\n\n04:20.060 --> 04:21.640\n And by the end of the day,\n\n04:21.640 --> 04:24.000\n you don't want to look at an item of food.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:25.520\n You're just repulsed by food.\n\n04:25.520 --> 04:27.880\n The only modification I made was the next day,\n\n04:27.880 --> 04:29.360\n I would fast completely,\n\n04:29.360 --> 04:32.360\n just to avoid the gastric distress of eating anything.\n\n04:32.360 --> 04:34.200\n And so I would do them on Sundays\n\n04:34.200 --> 04:35.520\n and then Mondays I'd fast all day.\n\n04:35.520 --> 04:37.580\n And then by Tuesday, I felt pretty good again,\n\n04:37.580 --> 04:38.720\n but Sunday and Monday,\n\n04:38.720 --> 04:42.680\n or you just feel like you're sliding down the slope\n\n04:42.680 --> 04:44.880\n of just blood sugar disaster.\n\n04:44.880 --> 04:46.000\n Terrible idea or a good idea?\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.160\n You know, at the time I enjoyed it.\n\n04:48.160 --> 04:50.300\n I love donuts, croissants, all that kind of stuff.\n\n04:50.300 --> 04:53.400\n What's interesting is after stopping that whole protocol,\n\n04:53.400 --> 04:54.840\n now I just try and eat well each day.\n\n04:54.840 --> 04:55.680\n Protocol.\n\n04:55.680 --> 04:56.520\n It's really a protocol.\n\n04:56.520 --> 04:59.240\n Now I basically, I do a pseudo intermittent fasting.\n\n04:59.240 --> 05:02.200\n I'm not really strict, but I'll start at eating around 11,\n\n05:02.200 --> 05:03.280\n eat my first meal around 11,\n\n05:03.280 --> 05:04.360\n I usually train in the morning,\n\n05:04.360 --> 05:06.520\n eat my last bite of food somewhere around eight or nine,\n\n05:06.520 --> 05:07.620\n and I'm not super strict.\n\n05:07.620 --> 05:09.440\n I might have some berries or something late at night.\n\n05:09.440 --> 05:11.160\n Three meals, two meals?\n\n05:11.160 --> 05:12.960\n Two meals.\n\n05:12.960 --> 05:15.280\n And then maybe a little bit of snacking on some nuts\n\n05:15.280 --> 05:16.160\n or something in the middle.\n\n05:16.160 --> 05:17.720\n Ever fast, 24 hour?\n\n05:17.720 --> 05:18.900\n Never done a long fast,\n\n05:18.900 --> 05:20.800\n except when I was doing the cheat days.\n\n05:20.800 --> 05:24.520\n And then, and actually there are a couple different ways\n\n05:24.520 --> 05:25.840\n to do cheat days that were fun.\n\n05:25.840 --> 05:26.920\n Like if you were in a new city,\n\n05:26.920 --> 05:30.520\n you could try all the restaurants that you wanted.\n\n05:30.520 --> 05:33.040\n Yeah, and I think Tim and our mutual friend,\n\n05:33.040 --> 05:34.440\n John Romanello did a,\n\n05:34.440 --> 05:36.760\n I think it was like a cheat day marathon where they did,\n\n05:36.760 --> 05:38.360\n you know, marathon's 26.3 miles.\n\n05:38.360 --> 05:41.680\n They went to 26.3 different locations in New York.\n\n05:41.680 --> 05:44.800\n They put it on a map and I never took it to that extreme,\n\n05:44.800 --> 05:45.640\n but.\n\n05:45.640 --> 05:46.480\n Wait, wait, wait.\n\n05:46.480 --> 05:47.500\n Over how many days?\n\n05:47.500 --> 05:48.340\n One day.\n\n05:48.340 --> 05:49.160\n That was their cheat day.\n\n05:49.160 --> 05:50.000\n Why?\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:50.840\n Just cause they were, you know.\n\n05:50.840 --> 05:53.040\n Just a little bit of something at each place.\n\n05:53.040 --> 05:54.320\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n05:54.320 --> 05:56.440\n I mean, there are things that guys do in their thirties\n\n05:56.440 --> 05:58.040\n that you just shouldn't do in your forties.\n\n05:58.040 --> 05:59.520\n I can say that cause I'm in my forties.\n\n05:59.520 --> 06:01.980\n And now I just try and eat well most days.\n\n06:01.980 --> 06:05.220\n And what's interesting is about 12 to 14 months ago,\n\n06:05.220 --> 06:08.140\n I completely lost all appetite for sweets.\n\n06:08.140 --> 06:08.980\n I don't know what happened.\n\n06:08.980 --> 06:10.000\n I still love savory food.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.320\n So meat and butter and cheese,\n\n06:12.320 --> 06:14.200\n and I love vegetables too.\n\n06:14.200 --> 06:16.880\n I love fruit also, but lost all appetite.\n\n06:16.880 --> 06:18.780\n So if you put a donut in front of me or ice cream\n\n06:18.780 --> 06:20.280\n or something like that, I just,\n\n06:20.280 --> 06:23.320\n it's almost aversive to me and I don't know what happened.\n\n06:23.320 --> 06:24.240\n I don't know what changed.\n\n06:24.240 --> 06:25.760\n It's probably a scientific explanation.\n\n06:25.760 --> 06:26.580\n Sure.\n\n06:26.580 --> 06:27.420\n It has to do maybe with habit.\n\n06:27.420 --> 06:28.560\n Neuron loss, dementia.\n\n06:28.560 --> 06:29.400\n Yeah.\n\n06:29.400 --> 06:34.400\n The sugar, the desire for that rush maybe is gone\n\n06:35.820 --> 06:37.440\n from your soul.\n\n06:37.440 --> 06:40.600\n So what was the most delicious things, croissant donuts?\n\n06:40.600 --> 06:42.240\n Is there a thing that?\n\n06:42.240 --> 06:44.760\n There's a place in Portland.\n\n06:44.760 --> 06:47.800\n I don't know if it's still open called Little T's Bakery.\n\n06:47.800 --> 06:50.780\n And they have croissants that easily rival\n\n06:50.780 --> 06:52.200\n the croissants in Paris.\n\n06:52.200 --> 06:54.680\n People make a lot of the pastry in Paris,\n\n06:54.680 --> 06:57.040\n but it's really the bread in Paris that's amazing.\n\n06:57.040 --> 06:59.400\n We lived there when I was a kid and we did a sabbatical\n\n06:59.400 --> 07:01.120\n there and you know, there they do the baguette,\n\n07:01.120 --> 07:02.880\n morning bake and afternoon bake.\n\n07:02.880 --> 07:07.000\n And there's nothing like the bread in Paris or the people,\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:10.700\n you know, and, but if you're in the Pacific Northwest,\n\n07:10.700 --> 07:13.000\n you know, you can find amazing croissants there.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:14.040\n What do you do with the croissant?\n\n07:14.040 --> 07:15.280\n What do you do with the bread?\n\n07:15.280 --> 07:16.520\n Butter or is it just?\n\n07:16.520 --> 07:18.380\n I actually used to, I don't eat them anymore.\n\n07:18.380 --> 07:19.760\n I don't have much of an appetite for them,\n\n07:19.760 --> 07:20.840\n even though they're not a sweet food,\n\n07:20.840 --> 07:24.000\n but I'm always putting butter on the croissant.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:25.360\n Butter on the butter croissant.\n\n07:25.360 --> 07:26.200\n No jam.\n\n07:26.200 --> 07:28.480\n I would never adulterate my croissant.\n\n07:28.480 --> 07:30.360\n I have to actually be honest about this\n\n07:30.360 --> 07:33.380\n because people talk about steak and they talk about bread\n\n07:33.380 --> 07:34.440\n with the butter.\n\n07:34.440 --> 07:35.800\n I feel like butter is cheating.\n\n07:35.800 --> 07:40.060\n I feel like you're disrespecting the fundamental food\n\n07:40.060 --> 07:41.320\n by adding butter.\n\n07:41.320 --> 07:43.580\n Cause butter, it's like, it's like,\n\n07:43.580 --> 07:47.680\n it's like a elite version of ketchup.\n\n07:47.680 --> 07:48.520\n You're.\n\n07:48.520 --> 07:49.520\n Well there we diverge because for me,\n\n07:49.520 --> 07:52.840\n bread is just a vehicle for butter.\n\n07:52.840 --> 07:56.760\n A cracker is just a vehicle for cheese.\n\n07:56.760 --> 07:57.880\n Oh, so that's just the,\n\n07:57.880 --> 07:59.920\n the cracker and the bread is just texture.\n\n07:59.920 --> 08:01.160\n It's just that people look at you funny\n\n08:01.160 --> 08:03.240\n if you, if you just eat the butter straight,\n\n08:03.240 --> 08:04.360\n which occasionally I do.\n\n08:04.360 --> 08:05.200\n I got it.\n\n08:05.200 --> 08:07.880\n So I put a little piece of bread underneath it,\n\n08:07.880 --> 08:10.240\n not because I'm low carb, strictly low carb,\n\n08:10.240 --> 08:13.000\n but just because otherwise you get some funny looks.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:17.140\n That's like pasta is a vehicle for pasta sauce.\n\n08:17.140 --> 08:20.640\n It's interesting, but like Indian non bread,\n\n08:20.640 --> 08:23.400\n you have, you have the bread.\n\n08:23.400 --> 08:25.440\n I've had a lot of soul searching\n\n08:25.440 --> 08:28.780\n on which part of Indian is, brings me so much joy.\n\n08:28.780 --> 08:30.800\n Is it the bread or is it all the sauces\n\n08:30.800 --> 08:31.680\n that come with the bread?\n\n08:31.680 --> 08:32.820\n Well, there we diverge again,\n\n08:32.820 --> 08:36.920\n because for whatever reason, no disrespect to anyone,\n\n08:36.920 --> 08:39.120\n but Indian food doesn't appeal to me.\n\n08:39.120 --> 08:40.320\n Well, you're a lucky man\n\n08:40.320 --> 08:43.160\n because the number of calories in that food,\n\n08:43.160 --> 08:44.800\n it sneaks like non bread.\n\n08:44.800 --> 08:46.120\n I don't know how non bread is made,\n\n08:46.120 --> 08:49.320\n but I think it's just soaked in oil\n\n08:49.320 --> 08:51.800\n and it just very intensely,\n\n08:51.800 --> 08:55.360\n like the density of calories is very, very high.\n\n08:56.320 --> 08:58.680\n For me, barbecue, I would say is probably the,\n\n08:58.680 --> 08:59.560\n that's good.\n\n08:59.560 --> 09:02.940\n Anytime I'm in Austin, I start thinking about barbecue.\n\n09:02.940 --> 09:04.360\n I do love, you know, I do love meat.\n\n09:04.360 --> 09:05.240\n My dad's Argentine.\n\n09:05.240 --> 09:06.200\n I mean, I love steak.\n\n09:06.200 --> 09:07.040\n I love meat.\n\n09:07.040 --> 09:09.440\n I mean, Argentina chorizo sausage\n\n09:09.440 --> 09:12.600\n is an appetizer before you have steak.\n\n09:12.600 --> 09:13.680\n It's meat on top of meat.\n\n09:13.680 --> 09:16.000\n And it's not just, you know, it's not just the men, right?\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.380\n You see women, sometimes very petite women\n\n09:18.380 --> 09:22.360\n eating steaks that are bigger than their skull size.\n\n09:22.360 --> 09:24.340\n You know, slowly, they eat very slowly there.\n\n09:24.340 --> 09:26.240\n And they all eat dessert too, which is interesting.\n\n09:26.240 --> 09:28.880\n And they generally do the sort of one meal per day\n\n09:28.880 --> 09:30.520\n and do that kind of real flexibly.\n\n09:30.520 --> 09:31.700\n That's how I think about it.\n\n09:31.700 --> 09:32.920\n Cause I often eat one meal a day,\n\n09:32.920 --> 09:34.200\n especially when I'm traveling.\n\n09:34.200 --> 09:36.640\n It feels like a cheap meal because it allows,\n\n09:36.640 --> 09:38.800\n it gives you a bit of more freedom\n\n09:38.800 --> 09:42.480\n to just lose yourself in the quantity of the food.\n\n09:42.480 --> 09:46.160\n I did the three day fast and I ate chicken breast,\n\n09:46.160 --> 09:47.960\n like literally chicken breast with nothing else,\n\n09:47.960 --> 09:48.840\n just grilled.\n\n09:48.840 --> 09:51.400\n And it was the most delicious piece of meat I've ever eaten.\n\n09:51.400 --> 09:53.560\n And that, and that gives you,\n\n09:53.560 --> 09:55.440\n the problem is when you fast the three days,\n\n09:55.440 --> 09:56.440\n you really can't pig out.\n\n09:56.440 --> 09:57.280\n You really shouldn't.\n\n09:57.280 --> 09:59.520\n Your stomach will shrink in size already.\n\n09:59.520 --> 10:01.280\n Your gut microbiome is almost completely\n\n10:01.280 --> 10:02.840\n depleted by fasting.\n\n10:02.840 --> 10:03.680\n A lot of people think, oh,\n\n10:03.680 --> 10:05.800\n cleanses and fasts are great for the microbiome.\n\n10:05.800 --> 10:07.640\n They quash your microbiome.\n\n10:07.640 --> 10:09.680\n However, when you start eating again,\n\n10:09.680 --> 10:11.640\n the microbiome comes back better\n\n10:11.640 --> 10:13.120\n than it was before your fast.\n\n10:13.120 --> 10:15.400\n For people who don't know, Sergey and Todd are on the call.\n\n10:15.400 --> 10:16.960\n They're kind of pulling stuff up.\n\n10:16.960 --> 10:19.360\n They just pulled up Phelps with the,\n\n10:19.360 --> 10:21.700\n I forget how many calories he was eating, 10,000.\n\n10:21.700 --> 10:22.540\n You know what's interesting?\n\n10:22.540 --> 10:24.800\n There's some, some cool physiology around this.\n\n10:24.800 --> 10:26.760\n The reason he needed to eat so much\n\n10:26.760 --> 10:30.040\n is not that he was burning that many calories\n\n10:30.040 --> 10:31.320\n in pure movement.\n\n10:31.320 --> 10:33.340\n It's that when you do exercise in water,\n\n10:33.340 --> 10:34.680\n even if it's warm water,\n\n10:34.680 --> 10:36.520\n the heat transfer in water is greater.\n\n10:36.520 --> 10:38.220\n So you burn far more calories.\n\n10:38.220 --> 10:40.520\n And again, here, I'm admittedly lifting that\n\n10:40.520 --> 10:43.240\n from knowledge that was passed on to me by Tim Ferriss.\n\n10:43.240 --> 10:45.160\n I didn't, so, but I checked it out\n\n10:45.160 --> 10:46.120\n and it's absolutely true.\n\n10:46.120 --> 10:47.960\n So if you exercise in water,\n\n10:47.960 --> 10:49.560\n even if it's not really cold water,\n\n10:49.560 --> 10:50.680\n your caloric needs go way up,\n\n10:50.680 --> 10:52.280\n which is why you get out of the pool\n\n10:52.280 --> 10:53.640\n and you're often really hungry.\n\n10:53.640 --> 10:56.040\n And for fans of the Human Lab podcast,\n\n10:56.040 --> 10:57.400\n and if you're not a fan,\n\n10:57.400 --> 10:59.160\n what are you doing with your life?\n\n11:00.440 --> 11:02.120\n You would probably chuckle at the fact\n\n11:02.120 --> 11:04.740\n that Andrew just cited his sources,\n\n11:04.740 --> 11:05.940\n even on that statement,\n\n11:05.940 --> 11:08.120\n because you're so good at,\n\n11:08.120 --> 11:09.360\n I don't know how your memory works,\n\n11:09.360 --> 11:12.400\n but the only person whose memory\n\n11:12.400 --> 11:14.520\n is better than Joe Rogan is yours.\n\n11:14.520 --> 11:16.420\n But my colleagues joke,\n\n11:16.420 --> 11:20.840\n you know, PubMed sort of scrolls through my mind.\n\n11:20.840 --> 11:22.580\n Also in science, as you know,\n\n11:22.580 --> 11:25.560\n attribution is so baked into what we do.\n\n11:25.560 --> 11:27.520\n And I think that it's interesting\n\n11:27.520 --> 11:29.840\n because now spending a lot of time on social media,\n\n11:29.840 --> 11:31.760\n attribution is not as common.\n\n11:31.760 --> 11:34.960\n And, but in academia, you learn really early on\n\n11:34.960 --> 11:37.280\n that if you give a talk about your data\n\n11:37.280 --> 11:39.320\n and you cite all these amazing sources,\n\n11:39.320 --> 11:42.380\n all it does is make you look better, right?\n\n11:42.380 --> 11:44.520\n Whereas in social media and elsewhere\n\n11:44.520 --> 11:45.620\n in the business sector,\n\n11:45.620 --> 11:47.000\n it's almost like citing other people,\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:48.480\n people feel as if it's going to take away\n\n11:48.480 --> 11:49.340\n some of the credit.\n\n11:49.340 --> 11:50.880\n All it does is place you in the company\n\n11:50.880 --> 11:52.500\n of people that do really nice work.\n\n11:52.500 --> 11:53.340\n So I have tremendous,\n\n11:53.340 --> 11:55.680\n and I have genuine and tremendous respect for Tim.\n\n11:55.680 --> 11:56.960\n He's been about 10 years ahead\n\n11:56.960 --> 11:59.000\n on a huge number of health related things\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.320\n and other things and extremely kind person,\n\n12:01.320 --> 12:02.320\n very thoughtful person.\n\n12:02.320 --> 12:05.080\n So it's also just a pleasure to shine light\n\n12:05.080 --> 12:05.920\n on other people.\n\n12:05.920 --> 12:07.480\n Yeah, well, I actually, to push back,\n\n12:07.480 --> 12:11.960\n I know there's a culture of if you write a paper,\n\n12:11.960 --> 12:15.080\n standing on the shoulders of giants is a powerful thing,\n\n12:15.080 --> 12:18.320\n but there's also a culture of not giving credit\n\n12:19.320 --> 12:21.320\n to the strongest idea in your paper.\n\n12:21.320 --> 12:24.860\n And instead say it's kind of, or imply that it's original.\n\n12:24.860 --> 12:28.480\n There is a culture of kind of not celebrating others.\n\n12:28.480 --> 12:33.160\n I think people get most competitive in all walks of life,\n\n12:33.160 --> 12:35.400\n but especially in science when they're,\n\n12:35.400 --> 12:39.000\n the closer they get in the exact thing they work on.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.040\n And so there's this dance,\n\n12:41.040 --> 12:43.040\n you know, there's a few researchers\n\n12:43.040 --> 12:46.160\n in each of the individual little things that you work on.\n\n12:46.160 --> 12:48.000\n If you're studying a particular kind of ant,\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.120\n you know that other asshole\n\n12:50.120 --> 12:52.560\n that also is studying that particular ant,\n\n12:52.560 --> 12:56.080\n and then you're not going to often give credit\n\n12:56.080 --> 12:59.700\n for the brilliant ideas that that other researcher is doing.\n\n12:59.700 --> 13:01.880\n And I think one of the things you've discovered\n\n13:01.880 --> 13:04.280\n and just as part of your nature,\n\n13:04.280 --> 13:08.520\n which is why it's really great that you have an audience\n\n13:08.520 --> 13:09.800\n and you inspire others to do the same,\n\n13:09.800 --> 13:12.660\n is you celebrate that other ant studier.\n\n13:12.660 --> 13:16.780\n It's great and everybody wins, it raises all boats.\n\n13:16.780 --> 13:19.820\n But that initial instinct to be like,\n\n13:19.820 --> 13:21.120\n what is it in Borat?\n\n13:21.120 --> 13:26.120\n Like my neighbor gets a toaster, I get a bigger toaster.\n\n13:27.040 --> 13:28.240\n Yeah, that mindset to, you know,\n\n13:28.240 --> 13:31.280\n it's not that I'm not competitive in certain domains,\n\n13:31.280 --> 13:33.760\n but yeah, I get great pleasure\n\n13:33.760 --> 13:37.160\n from sharing things that I find.\n\n13:37.160 --> 13:40.940\n And I think that, you know, at the end of the day,\n\n13:40.940 --> 13:43.640\n you're as strong as your community\n\n13:43.640 --> 13:45.920\n and you can build a wonderful community\n\n13:45.920 --> 13:48.760\n just by pointing out things that you love.\n\n13:48.760 --> 13:49.880\n Like these are all just loves.\n\n13:49.880 --> 13:51.600\n I see a paper and I love it.\n\n13:51.600 --> 13:54.080\n Only rarely do I think, oh, I wish we had done that.\n\n13:54.080 --> 13:55.320\n I usually think, fantastic,\n\n13:55.320 --> 13:56.680\n now I can just focus on something else\n\n13:56.680 --> 13:58.420\n because they checked off that box.\n\n13:59.320 --> 14:02.000\n And by the way, you mentioned PubMed and barbecue.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.160\n I should mention that I got a chance to hang out\n\n14:04.160 --> 14:06.120\n with Rick Rubin, thanks to you.\n\n14:06.120 --> 14:07.940\n He's a friend of yours and you made the connection.\n\n14:07.940 --> 14:11.160\n That was a huge gift to my spirit, I guess.\n\n14:11.160 --> 14:13.160\n He's a truly, truly special human being.\n\n14:13.160 --> 14:15.560\n And there's a lot I could say\n\n14:15.560 --> 14:17.440\n about why he's a special human being.\n\n14:17.440 --> 14:19.640\n I'd love to learn how you met him,\n\n14:19.640 --> 14:22.360\n but I should also just mention on the PubMed thing,\n\n14:23.560 --> 14:25.920\n it was so interesting talking to him about music\n\n14:27.320 --> 14:31.000\n and both on the podcast and privately\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:32.780\n and just listening to music together.\n\n14:32.780 --> 14:36.000\n Because when you mention a song,\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:39.960\n he does this thing where he like closes his eyes\n\n14:39.960 --> 14:44.120\n and he finds that song in the album that we're talking about\n\n14:44.120 --> 14:45.880\n and he steps through the album.\n\n14:45.880 --> 14:47.840\n You could see the brain like stepping\n\n14:47.840 --> 14:51.200\n through individual songs to find that song in the album.\n\n14:51.200 --> 14:53.080\n And there's that kind of lookup process.\n\n14:53.080 --> 14:55.320\n And then he puts himself mentally in that space\n\n14:55.320 --> 14:59.800\n of like, okay, this is, you know, whatever the album is.\n\n14:59.800 --> 15:01.520\n And not just the ones he produced,\n\n15:01.520 --> 15:04.940\n but all of these in the encyclopedia of music.\n\n15:04.940 --> 15:06.480\n And it's so interesting.\n\n15:06.480 --> 15:10.160\n It also, the thing I really love about him\n\n15:10.160 --> 15:13.520\n is something like a calmness that radiates from him.\n\n15:13.520 --> 15:16.680\n That it's okay to close your eyes and place yourself\n\n15:16.680 --> 15:19.680\n in the place where that album was recorded,\n\n15:20.540 --> 15:24.540\n in the feeling of that album and like that silence.\n\n15:24.540 --> 15:26.640\n Let's go there, let's go there together.\n\n15:26.640 --> 15:28.680\n It's like Alice in Wonderland and we'll go there together.\n\n15:28.680 --> 15:31.160\n You do a good Rick Rubin, minus the beard.\n\n15:31.160 --> 15:32.000\n Minus the beard.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:33.720\n His beard is epic, right?\n\n15:33.720 --> 15:35.900\n You can't fake a beard like that, you know.\n\n15:35.900 --> 15:37.240\n How'd you guys meet?\n\n15:37.240 --> 15:42.240\n Yeah, well, Rick, I'm very blessed to consider a close friend.\n\n15:42.240 --> 15:45.840\n Rick and I got introduced through a common friend\n\n15:45.840 --> 15:47.320\n during the pandemic.\n\n15:47.320 --> 15:49.660\n And we started doing some FaceTime together\n\n15:49.660 --> 15:52.000\n and just talking about things related to science and health.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:56.020\n And I'm not a musician, I have no musical ability or talent.\n\n15:56.020 --> 15:58.200\n I have a good ability to memorize lyrics\n\n15:58.200 --> 16:00.280\n and I love lyrics and I love poetry.\n\n16:00.280 --> 16:02.740\n So I asked him a lot of questions about musicians\n\n16:02.740 --> 16:05.420\n that I happen to love that he's worked with and knows.\n\n16:05.420 --> 16:07.840\n And so he would give me stories about musicians\n\n16:07.840 --> 16:10.140\n and I would talk to him about health.\n\n16:10.140 --> 16:12.040\n And then eventually we formed a friendship\n\n16:12.040 --> 16:13.340\n where we would talk about any number\n\n16:13.340 --> 16:15.560\n of different topics in life.\n\n16:15.560 --> 16:18.720\n And then we started spending time together in person\n\n16:18.720 --> 16:21.100\n when he was in town or nearby.\n\n16:21.100 --> 16:25.300\n And as you now know, you know, Rick,\n\n16:26.360 --> 16:28.520\n in addition to all his incredible accomplishments,\n\n16:28.520 --> 16:31.240\n has an incredible understanding\n\n16:31.240 --> 16:36.240\n of how to get the brain and body into state, right?\n\n16:36.640 --> 16:40.800\n And as you pointed out, he's willing to do the things\n\n16:40.800 --> 16:43.560\n that allow him to help these incredible artists\n\n16:43.560 --> 16:46.960\n get into the best state to do their craft.\n\n16:46.960 --> 16:49.660\n And so if he needs to sit there and be quiet\n\n16:49.660 --> 16:53.600\n with his eyes closed for a minute or two or more,\n\n16:53.600 --> 16:54.880\n he'll do that.\n\n16:54.880 --> 16:57.960\n He has routines to allow himself to get into state.\n\n16:57.960 --> 17:01.200\n And it's really inspired me to think about states of mind\n\n17:01.200 --> 17:02.680\n as something that, you know, we'd all love\n\n17:02.680 --> 17:04.160\n to just flip the switch and say,\n\n17:04.160 --> 17:05.640\n we're focused or we're creative,\n\n17:05.640 --> 17:09.960\n but to actually ratchet through the challenging steps\n\n17:09.960 --> 17:11.280\n in order to do that and to figure out\n\n17:11.280 --> 17:14.360\n what one needs to do on a regular basis\n\n17:14.360 --> 17:16.400\n to get into a proper state.\n\n17:16.400 --> 17:19.360\n It's not just gonna come from a cup of coffee,\n\n17:19.360 --> 17:22.640\n you know, a lamp of a particular wavelength or something.\n\n17:22.640 --> 17:23.620\n It's gonna be those things,\n\n17:23.620 --> 17:26.680\n but it's also going to be really teaching oneself\n\n17:26.680 --> 17:28.480\n how to get into proper state.\n\n17:28.480 --> 17:30.120\n Yeah, you did an episode on hypnosis.\n\n17:30.120 --> 17:32.600\n Do you think it's a kind of self hypnosis?\n\n17:32.600 --> 17:33.920\n Yes, I do.\n\n17:33.920 --> 17:38.160\n Because hypnosis is a, you limit the context,\n\n17:38.160 --> 17:41.400\n you're very alert and you're very calm.\n\n17:41.400 --> 17:44.360\n And he has a number of these different practices.\n\n17:44.360 --> 17:45.640\n And so we would talk about those.\n\n17:45.640 --> 17:48.480\n And then we also have enjoyed a lot of discussions\n\n17:48.480 --> 17:50.220\n about deep neuroscience.\n\n17:50.220 --> 17:52.760\n In fact, I introduced Rick to a friend of mine\n\n17:52.760 --> 17:54.920\n who's a neurosurgeon and neuroscientist\n\n17:54.920 --> 17:56.320\n and they've become friendly.\n\n17:56.320 --> 17:57.520\n You know, Rick is one of these people\n\n17:57.520 --> 18:00.680\n that he sort of defies definition, incredibly kind,\n\n18:00.680 --> 18:02.160\n incredibly private person too.\n\n18:02.160 --> 18:04.000\n So, you know, I'm being respectful of that.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:07.520\n But, and then of course he's a fan of your podcast.\n\n18:07.520 --> 18:09.040\n And so when I learned that,\n\n18:09.040 --> 18:11.900\n I just made natural sense to introduce you.\n\n18:11.900 --> 18:13.780\n And I know he really enjoyed meeting you.\n\n18:13.780 --> 18:15.440\n And we talk about you a lot.\n\n18:15.440 --> 18:17.600\n And of course, in a positive light, you know,\n\n18:17.600 --> 18:21.880\n I think his dedication to getting into these states of mind\n\n18:21.880 --> 18:22.920\n and his willingness to do that\n\n18:22.920 --> 18:26.400\n has completely transformed my routines around life.\n\n18:26.400 --> 18:27.240\n Like for instance,\n\n18:27.240 --> 18:29.360\n before doing a very long podcast recording,\n\n18:29.360 --> 18:32.280\n the solo ones, which often take me several hours or more,\n\n18:32.280 --> 18:35.300\n six hours to record, sometimes more, sometimes less.\n\n18:35.300 --> 18:37.440\n I realized that there's a certain brain state\n\n18:37.440 --> 18:38.320\n associated with that.\n\n18:38.320 --> 18:41.040\n So I have to really limit the kind of interactions I have\n\n18:41.040 --> 18:42.520\n for the two hours before.\n\n18:42.520 --> 18:45.680\n I actually walk and talk out loud through my neighborhood.\n\n18:45.680 --> 18:46.960\n People think I'm crazy,\n\n18:46.960 --> 18:47.920\n but I live in a neighborhood\n\n18:47.920 --> 18:50.880\n where there are a lot of crazy creatives anyway.\n\n18:50.880 --> 18:51.720\n So.\n\n18:51.720 --> 18:52.560\n Are you saying you're not crazy?\n\n18:52.560 --> 18:57.560\n Well, at least not institutionally defined as crazy yet.\n\n18:57.920 --> 19:00.760\n But, you know, getting into state of mind\n\n19:00.760 --> 19:02.840\n is something that we'd all just imagine we flip the switch,\n\n19:02.840 --> 19:04.080\n but Rick really convinced me,\n\n19:04.080 --> 19:06.680\n you have to do the work to do the work.\n\n19:06.680 --> 19:09.440\n Can you maybe linger on that,\n\n19:09.440 --> 19:11.200\n elucidate a little bit more of your process\n\n19:11.200 --> 19:12.880\n of how you get in that space?\n\n19:12.880 --> 19:14.040\n That's really interesting.\n\n19:14.040 --> 19:16.600\n Cause I have to admit,\n\n19:16.600 --> 19:19.240\n I do everything last minute before a podcast.\n\n19:19.240 --> 19:20.080\n I don't know.\n\n19:21.320 --> 19:24.160\n Like there's a lot of anxiety because like whatever,\n\n19:24.160 --> 19:27.120\n if I have to pack, if I have to set up stuff,\n\n19:27.120 --> 19:29.040\n you were luckily a few minutes,\n\n19:29.040 --> 19:30.520\n you showed up a few minutes later.\n\n19:30.520 --> 19:32.080\n Which for an academic is right on time.\n\n19:32.080 --> 19:33.280\n Right on time.\n\n19:33.280 --> 19:36.040\n But the stress is immense.\n\n19:36.040 --> 19:38.080\n And on top of that,\n\n19:38.080 --> 19:41.560\n you look at like a situation with Rick Rubin,\n\n19:41.560 --> 19:44.760\n is I had to set up microphones in front of him\n\n19:44.760 --> 19:47.000\n and just that stress, the anxiety.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:48.320\n He knows a lot about microphones.\n\n19:48.320 --> 19:49.160\n What did he say?\n\n19:49.160 --> 19:50.180\n Which I really loved.\n\n19:50.180 --> 19:55.180\n He's like, how close do you like the microphone to be?\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:56.840\n It's like.\n\n19:56.840 --> 19:59.120\n That's a very Rick Rubin kind of thing, right?\n\n19:59.120 --> 20:01.620\n That the details really matter.\n\n20:01.620 --> 20:03.600\n The details really matter,\n\n20:03.600 --> 20:07.600\n right down to your relationship to the microphone, right?\n\n20:07.600 --> 20:09.660\n Distance and whether or not it brings out the timbre\n\n20:09.660 --> 20:10.500\n in your voice.\n\n20:10.500 --> 20:11.320\n But of course that's what he does.\n\n20:11.320 --> 20:12.160\n He produces music.\n\n20:12.160 --> 20:15.880\n But he also said like, you know, he is the professional.\n\n20:15.880 --> 20:20.320\n He said, how close do you like it to be?\n\n20:20.320 --> 20:22.440\n And he said it with a gentleness\n\n20:22.440 --> 20:24.820\n where I had like an existential crisis.\n\n20:24.820 --> 20:26.420\n Where I don't, I don't know.\n\n20:27.660 --> 20:30.120\n He gave me so much like, wow.\n\n20:30.120 --> 20:31.960\n Like he made me feel like an artist.\n\n20:31.960 --> 20:35.040\n Like that the microphone distance\n\n20:35.040 --> 20:37.320\n is a decision you're supposed to make.\n\n20:37.320 --> 20:39.400\n Well, I have to say, and this has actually come up\n\n20:39.400 --> 20:41.440\n in some of our conversations about you.\n\n20:41.440 --> 20:42.920\n I mean, you are, you are an artist.\n\n20:42.920 --> 20:44.800\n And actually Joe Rogan,\n\n20:44.800 --> 20:46.960\n once I heard him talking about podcasting\n\n20:46.960 --> 20:48.960\n and the fact that he's always trying to get better at it,\n\n20:48.960 --> 20:50.960\n you know, and he described podcasting at one moment\n\n20:50.960 --> 20:52.500\n as an art, right?\n\n20:52.500 --> 20:55.600\n And it is, it's a certain medium of communication\n\n20:55.600 --> 20:59.400\n and there's a cadence and a rhythm that when it's working,\n\n20:59.400 --> 21:01.920\n it really can facilitate the transfer of information.\n\n21:01.920 --> 21:03.220\n When it's not, it doesn't.\n\n21:03.220 --> 21:05.720\n I mean, obviously Joe just being himself\n\n21:05.720 --> 21:08.800\n has tapped into that cadence that allows\n\n21:08.800 --> 21:11.840\n and it's made so many people excited to hear him talk.\n\n21:11.840 --> 21:13.200\n Well, in his case and in general,\n\n21:13.200 --> 21:17.880\n I think part of the art is refusing the world\n\n21:17.880 --> 21:21.120\n as you get a bigger audience, change who you are.\n\n21:21.120 --> 21:23.180\n There's one quote that I've seen out there where he says,\n\n21:23.180 --> 21:25.600\n you know, I'm like the, talking about himself, he says,\n\n21:25.600 --> 21:27.540\n you know, I'm like the fish that got through the net.\n\n21:27.540 --> 21:29.760\n There's no stage version of me, right?\n\n21:29.760 --> 21:33.240\n How he is in person is how he is, you know,\n\n21:33.240 --> 21:34.080\n out in the world.\n\n21:34.080 --> 21:36.460\n And of course there's nuance to his life, right?\n\n21:36.460 --> 21:40.200\n And his different relationships, of course, but it's true.\n\n21:40.200 --> 21:41.760\n I mean, we've had the, you know,\n\n21:41.760 --> 21:43.720\n the great fortune of spending time with him\n\n21:43.720 --> 21:46.860\n out away from the microphones, so to speak.\n\n21:46.860 --> 21:48.160\n Joe is Joe.\n\n21:48.160 --> 21:51.120\n So can you speak to your, that process you mentioned,\n\n21:51.120 --> 21:52.720\n the walking and the talking to yourself?\n\n21:52.720 --> 21:53.560\n Cause that's fascinating.\n\n21:53.560 --> 21:57.600\n Yeah, I try and do a couple of things.\n\n21:57.600 --> 21:59.100\n First of all, when I was a kid,\n\n21:59.100 --> 22:01.360\n I had a little bit of a grunting tick.\n\n22:01.360 --> 22:03.220\n When I was five or six,\n\n22:03.220 --> 22:06.680\n I would feel this buildup of tension in my throat\n\n22:06.680 --> 22:07.700\n and I would do this grunting tick.\n\n22:07.700 --> 22:10.280\n If I get very tired, I start to do it still.\n\n22:10.280 --> 22:11.800\n We actually know that this is related\n\n22:11.800 --> 22:14.120\n to these basal ganglia circuits for go, no go.\n\n22:14.120 --> 22:16.160\n You've got an accelerator and a brake basically\n\n22:16.160 --> 22:21.160\n in your neural circuitry and kids with Tourette's and OCD,\n\n22:21.220 --> 22:23.360\n the brake doesn't work quite as well.\n\n22:23.360 --> 22:25.080\n And so one thing that happens is if I wake up\n\n22:25.080 --> 22:27.880\n in the morning and especially if I'm well rested,\n\n22:27.880 --> 22:30.120\n well, if I'm not well rested, I do a hypnosis\n\n22:30.120 --> 22:32.240\n or yoga nidra in order to recover my sleep.\n\n22:32.240 --> 22:33.080\n That works really well.\n\n22:33.080 --> 22:36.800\n But then once I'm into the process of preparing the podcast,\n\n22:36.800 --> 22:37.940\n I've already gone through my notes.\n\n22:37.940 --> 22:39.480\n I know what I want to say more or less\n\n22:39.480 --> 22:40.840\n in a kind of general contour.\n\n22:40.840 --> 22:45.480\n And then I take a walk and I try to, so no phone with me.\n\n22:45.480 --> 22:49.920\n And I try to assess whether or not my energy is too high\n\n22:49.920 --> 22:52.140\n or too low for podcasting.\n\n22:52.140 --> 22:54.160\n Because when you podcast, as you know,\n\n22:54.160 --> 22:55.920\n you have to punch out a lot of material,\n\n22:55.920 --> 22:57.660\n but then there's times when you really need to slow down\n\n22:57.660 --> 22:59.600\n and emphasize and articulate.\n\n22:59.600 --> 23:04.160\n And so what I do, I've never revealed this.\n\n23:04.160 --> 23:08.000\n What I do actually is I will recite the lyrics of songs\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:12.480\n for about 10 minutes, songs I love while I walk out loud.\n\n23:12.480 --> 23:14.480\n It calms you and focuses you, what does it do for you?\n\n23:14.480 --> 23:19.480\n I think it gets my vocal cords warmed up and it also.\n\n23:19.760 --> 23:21.120\n Do you sing or speak them?\n\n23:21.120 --> 23:25.600\n I often sing them and fortunately nobody hears.\n\n23:25.600 --> 23:28.880\n And as I do this, I start to evaluate\n\n23:28.880 --> 23:30.920\n whether or not I'm straining to get the words out\n\n23:30.920 --> 23:34.960\n or whether or not I'm straining to make them slow enough\n\n23:34.960 --> 23:37.240\n so that I can articulate them.\n\n23:37.240 --> 23:39.800\n So there are days when I have so much energy\n\n23:39.800 --> 23:44.460\n that I'm trying to speak faster than I should\n\n23:44.460 --> 23:46.080\n in order to articulate properly.\n\n23:46.080 --> 23:47.380\n There are other days when I'm tired\n\n23:47.380 --> 23:49.520\n and I can't sort of keep up with my thoughts.\n\n23:49.520 --> 23:51.480\n And so what I try and do is assess that\n\n23:51.480 --> 23:55.260\n and then adjust the transmission, the RPM, so to speak.\n\n23:55.260 --> 23:56.560\n For instance, I can speak very quickly\n\n23:56.560 --> 23:57.860\n and then I can slow down.\n\n23:57.860 --> 23:59.680\n So I can change the cadence of my voice.\n\n23:59.680 --> 24:01.520\n And when you teach in the classroom,\n\n24:01.520 --> 24:02.940\n you learn as you know,\n\n24:02.940 --> 24:03.920\n cause you're an excellent teacher,\n\n24:03.920 --> 24:05.800\n I've watched your lectures in the classroom.\n\n24:05.800 --> 24:09.480\n As you teach in the classroom, when you want to slow down,\n\n24:09.480 --> 24:11.880\n every teacher knows you turn to the whiteboard or chalkboard\n\n24:11.880 --> 24:13.040\n and you start writing, right?\n\n24:13.040 --> 24:14.240\n It gives you a break.\n\n24:14.240 --> 24:16.220\n And then you turn around and you fire back\n\n24:16.220 --> 24:19.040\n the kind of machine gun fire of information.\n\n24:19.040 --> 24:20.920\n And then you slow down or you underline something.\n\n24:20.920 --> 24:24.600\n When you podcast, you don't have that opportunity, right?\n\n24:24.600 --> 24:26.340\n There are no visuals in my podcast.\n\n24:26.340 --> 24:31.340\n So what I try and do is always get my voice warmed up\n\n24:31.560 --> 24:33.720\n and make sure that I'm thinking and speaking\n\n24:33.720 --> 24:36.040\n at approximately the same rate.\n\n24:36.040 --> 24:38.920\n And then I also do this thing of as I put my vision\n\n24:38.920 --> 24:42.680\n into panoramic vision when I walk, which is very calming.\n\n24:42.680 --> 24:46.040\n And then I actually start to remind myself\n\n24:46.040 --> 24:47.520\n of the purpose of podcasting.\n\n24:47.520 --> 24:49.480\n This sounds very mission statementy,\n\n24:49.480 --> 24:51.480\n but you asked what I do.\n\n24:51.480 --> 24:54.820\n I remind myself first and foremost\n\n24:54.820 --> 24:56.160\n that what I want to communicate,\n\n24:56.160 --> 24:57.920\n what I want to come through is the beauty\n\n24:57.920 --> 25:00.160\n and utility of biology.\n\n25:00.160 --> 25:02.980\n And I only feel comfortable saying the word beauty\n\n25:02.980 --> 25:06.360\n publicly now about science things thanks to you,\n\n25:06.360 --> 25:07.600\n because I think.\n\n25:07.600 --> 25:09.000\n Love and beauty.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:10.840\n Yeah, love and beauty.\n\n25:10.840 --> 25:11.840\n Dr. Andrew Huberman.\n\n25:11.840 --> 25:14.760\n Love and beauty, but also darkness and hatred.\n\n25:14.760 --> 25:17.200\n And if you're talking about the Lex Friedman podcast,\n\n25:17.200 --> 25:18.040\n you have to adjust,\n\n25:18.040 --> 25:21.100\n you have to address the shadow also, the shadow side.\n\n25:21.100 --> 25:22.360\n But I think about the,\n\n25:22.360 --> 25:26.360\n I want to communicate the beauty and utility of biology.\n\n25:26.360 --> 25:29.960\n And then I check my emotional state.\n\n25:29.960 --> 25:32.760\n I want to make sure that I'm not angry about anything.\n\n25:33.840 --> 25:35.640\n And certainly if I am that I'm going to set it aside\n\n25:35.640 --> 25:36.480\n for the podcast,\n\n25:36.480 --> 25:38.600\n because that's not a place for my,\n\n25:38.600 --> 25:40.260\n whatever I might be dealing with.\n\n25:40.260 --> 25:43.460\n I also really start to feel into the parts of the research\n\n25:43.460 --> 25:45.620\n and the papers I found that I really love,\n\n25:45.620 --> 25:50.620\n because that's the part of me that I like the most frankly.\n\n25:52.060 --> 25:54.760\n And on the podcast, if there's a paper,\n\n25:54.760 --> 25:56.740\n like for instance, we have a paper, excuse me,\n\n25:56.740 --> 26:01.040\n a podcast coming out soon about heat as a tool,\n\n26:01.040 --> 26:02.320\n sauna, but some other things.\n\n26:02.320 --> 26:03.680\n And in researching this,\n\n26:03.680 --> 26:07.440\n I learned so much about these heat shock proteins\n\n26:07.440 --> 26:09.960\n and the use of sauna in Finland\n\n26:09.960 --> 26:11.080\n for increasing growth hormone,\n\n26:11.080 --> 26:12.960\n but also for the treatment of mental illness.\n\n26:12.960 --> 26:15.160\n And I realized I fell in love with this literature.\n\n26:15.160 --> 26:17.000\n It's just a beautiful literature.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:19.020\n These people are true pioneers for doing this work.\n\n26:19.020 --> 26:21.740\n Now everyone's in the sauna, but this was 20 years ago.\n\n26:21.740 --> 26:23.840\n The way the experiments were done were amazing\n\n26:23.840 --> 26:26.800\n with all these Finnish people with thermocouples up there,\n\n26:26.800 --> 26:29.480\n rectum to measure temperature, swimming in pools.\n\n26:29.480 --> 26:30.680\n It's hilarious and great.\n\n26:30.680 --> 26:32.780\n And so I start to think about, and I think,\n\n26:33.880 --> 26:36.660\n I just start to really access my love of the work.\n\n26:36.660 --> 26:39.180\n And then when we finally sit down,\n\n26:39.180 --> 26:42.440\n meaning my producer Rob and I and record,\n\n26:42.440 --> 26:46.200\n I just sort of want to just bask in sharing it.\n\n26:46.200 --> 26:48.760\n Just like the little version of me when I was six or seven,\n\n26:48.760 --> 26:51.120\n I used to spend all weekend reading the encyclopedia,\n\n26:51.120 --> 26:53.020\n Guinness Book of World Records,\n\n26:53.020 --> 26:55.960\n making my mother drive me places to introduce me to,\n\n26:55.960 --> 26:57.720\n I had this obsession with trapping animals\n\n26:57.720 --> 26:58.880\n when I was a kid, meet these people.\n\n26:58.880 --> 27:02.100\n And then on Monday, I would insist on giving a lecture\n\n27:02.100 --> 27:03.640\n in class, which as a little kid.\n\n27:03.640 --> 27:04.720\n So that's basically what it is.\n\n27:04.720 --> 27:07.920\n I just try and access that childlike energy.\n\n27:07.920 --> 27:09.960\n And so I want to be clear.\n\n27:09.960 --> 27:13.120\n The goal is always to make the information interesting,\n\n27:13.120 --> 27:15.640\n clear and actionable.\n\n27:15.640 --> 27:18.720\n And if it's also surprising, then that's a bonus.\n\n27:18.720 --> 27:19.920\n But that's basically the process.\n\n27:19.920 --> 27:24.640\n But yeah, I'm singing and talking and getting into state.\n\n27:24.640 --> 27:27.920\n And I used to feel very sheepish about sharing any of this.\n\n27:27.920 --> 27:29.780\n This is the first time I've ever shared it out loud,\n\n27:29.780 --> 27:32.000\n but Rick was the one who encouraged me\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:34.640\n to find a process that works\n\n27:34.640 --> 27:36.840\n and continue to develop that process\n\n27:36.840 --> 27:39.600\n and not let anything get near that process.\n\n27:39.600 --> 27:41.640\n People in my personal life know this.\n\n27:41.640 --> 27:43.000\n And when it's time, it's like,\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:44.960\n I don't care what else is going on,\n\n27:44.960 --> 27:47.240\n I'm moving into that brain state.\n\n27:47.240 --> 27:48.640\n And there's probably a process like that\n\n27:48.640 --> 27:51.900\n for anything that you do in life that you take seriously.\n\n27:51.900 --> 27:55.120\n So the people that have perfected this is athletes.\n\n27:55.120 --> 27:56.640\n Like if Olympic level athletes,\n\n27:56.640 --> 27:58.360\n they have to have a process like this.\n\n27:58.360 --> 27:59.720\n You know what, I think Tiger Woods actually\n\n27:59.720 --> 28:02.320\n was taught self hypnosis quite young\n\n28:03.760 --> 28:07.760\n and use self hypnosis often during his tournaments,\n\n28:07.760 --> 28:11.420\n sometimes to great success and other times less so.\n\n28:11.420 --> 28:15.200\n Is there other places in life that you use\n\n28:16.360 --> 28:20.480\n kind of a protocol, like a mental protocol to get ready?\n\n28:20.480 --> 28:22.440\n Many of the best areas of life\n\n28:22.440 --> 28:25.240\n are their own form of hypnosis, right?\n\n28:25.240 --> 28:26.080\n True.\n\n28:26.080 --> 28:27.040\n You know that you're in hypnosis,\n\n28:27.040 --> 28:29.220\n if for instance, you're in a movie and something happens\n\n28:29.220 --> 28:30.560\n and you feel the emotional lift\n\n28:30.560 --> 28:32.880\n without being self conscious about it.\n\n28:32.880 --> 28:37.880\n Yes, I think that one thing that we've tried to do\n\n28:38.440 --> 28:42.800\n in our house is around meal times to try and set a state\n\n28:42.800 --> 28:44.000\n that food isn't just something\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.440\n that we just throw down our throats.\n\n28:46.440 --> 28:49.300\n And I'm fortunate that my partner cooks really well.\n\n28:49.300 --> 28:52.400\n And so I try and give her the space to do that.\n\n28:52.400 --> 28:55.280\n And that's the whole thing of her getting into state.\n\n28:55.280 --> 28:56.120\n And then.\n\n28:56.120 --> 28:56.960\n For the cooking.\n\n28:56.960 --> 28:57.780\n For the cooking.\n\n28:57.780 --> 28:58.620\n The preparation of all the.\n\n28:58.620 --> 28:59.460\n I can just see it.\n\n28:59.460 --> 29:01.240\n I just see the way she approaches the whole thing\n\n29:01.240 --> 29:03.160\n and the pleasure in serving it.\n\n29:03.160 --> 29:04.760\n And I'm an eater, not a cooker.\n\n29:05.800 --> 29:06.640\n But.\n\n29:06.640 --> 29:08.000\n Both are important roles.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.560\n You could be a very good eater.\n\n29:09.560 --> 29:11.200\n Like there's something about,\n\n29:11.200 --> 29:14.680\n is there anything better in this world than that feeling?\n\n29:14.680 --> 29:18.560\n Especially if it's a family, getting around a table.\n\n29:18.560 --> 29:20.500\n Just the warmth of that.\n\n29:20.500 --> 29:21.340\n I don't know.\n\n29:21.340 --> 29:26.340\n It's like the cold outside of the cruel world\n\n29:27.120 --> 29:29.840\n cannot touch you in this place that you've returned to.\n\n29:29.840 --> 29:31.640\n And if.\n\n29:31.640 --> 29:32.480\n I mean.\n\n29:32.480 --> 29:34.640\n Did you grow up eating meals as a family?\n\n29:34.640 --> 29:35.480\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n29:35.480 --> 29:36.320\n I mean.\n\n29:36.320 --> 29:37.880\n No television?\n\n29:37.880 --> 29:38.720\n No.\n\n29:38.720 --> 29:43.280\n I didn't really have television period outside of meals.\n\n29:44.400 --> 29:48.280\n So most of my time was spent, you know,\n\n29:48.280 --> 29:53.080\n like a stray cat outdoors, just running around,\n\n29:53.080 --> 29:53.920\n playing soccer.\n\n29:53.920 --> 29:56.960\n I imagine you in this like dirt or concrete lot\n\n29:56.960 --> 30:00.280\n between two very high rise buildings playing soccer\n\n30:00.280 --> 30:04.480\n in like athletic gear that you only see in Eastern Europe.\n\n30:04.480 --> 30:05.800\n You know how like you come to the States\n\n30:05.800 --> 30:07.200\n and people wear their athletic gear.\n\n30:07.200 --> 30:10.880\n You go to Europe and you see, maybe it's the soccer culture,\n\n30:10.880 --> 30:12.240\n but you see athletic gear\n\n30:12.240 --> 30:14.160\n that you just don't see anywhere else.\n\n30:14.160 --> 30:15.000\n That's interesting.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\n I mean, I grew up pretty poor.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:20.760\n So first of all, I was always wearing my brother's,\n\n30:20.760 --> 30:23.600\n who's an older brother, brother's clothes.\n\n30:23.600 --> 30:28.600\n And they were like old, like my favorite things\n\n30:29.440 --> 30:31.960\n were American things that I didn't understand.\n\n30:31.960 --> 30:34.280\n It would be like a Pepsi shirt or something.\n\n30:34.280 --> 30:36.560\n And it was just, that was the gear.\n\n30:36.560 --> 30:38.040\n And it was like too large for me,\n\n30:38.040 --> 30:40.200\n but I thought I was the coolest person ever\n\n30:40.200 --> 30:44.800\n just wearing this fancy like Kanye like type of fashion.\n\n30:44.800 --> 30:45.640\n Yeah, there's something about,\n\n30:45.640 --> 30:47.720\n I feel like in Eastern Europe,\n\n30:47.720 --> 30:50.080\n they wear athletic gear where like the guys like zip up.\n\n30:50.080 --> 30:52.080\n Yeah, no, that's like fancy stuff.\n\n30:52.080 --> 30:54.480\n That's if you like, those are the cool kids.\n\n30:54.480 --> 30:55.960\n I see, I see.\n\n30:55.960 --> 30:58.640\n Like the cool soccer players, football players\n\n30:58.640 --> 31:02.400\n that like they were in a league of some kind.\n\n31:02.400 --> 31:06.880\n So they would get uniforms or like, or they somehow,\n\n31:06.880 --> 31:10.360\n I always thought anyone who had anything nice\n\n31:10.360 --> 31:13.040\n had to do something really bad to get it.\n\n31:13.040 --> 31:15.680\n That was my way, view of the world.\n\n31:15.680 --> 31:20.360\n Because like, I guess I didn't understand\n\n31:20.360 --> 31:22.360\n how it's possible to be rich.\n\n31:22.360 --> 31:25.280\n Cause most of us were surrounded by people who are poor\n\n31:25.280 --> 31:26.800\n and that life is beautiful and simple.\n\n31:26.800 --> 31:28.840\n And it's like, why do you escape that life?\n\n31:28.840 --> 31:30.960\n But you still admire the cool,\n\n31:30.960 --> 31:34.800\n like when we got McDonald's, it was like,\n\n31:35.680 --> 31:39.960\n what kind of world does this place come from?\n\n31:39.960 --> 31:42.600\n Like who invented this?\n\n31:42.600 --> 31:45.520\n This is a fascinating view from a child's perspective\n\n31:45.520 --> 31:47.720\n of like, of capitalism essentially.\n\n31:47.720 --> 31:49.920\n Yeah, but the fact that you ate dinner together\n\n31:49.920 --> 31:51.400\n is really interesting.\n\n31:51.400 --> 31:53.520\n My parents divorced when I was an adolescent.\n\n31:53.520 --> 31:56.560\n So then there was a total fracture of any family structure.\n\n31:56.560 --> 31:58.880\n But prior to that, we ate dinner together every night.\n\n31:58.880 --> 32:00.880\n I was expected to know how to use my knife and fork.\n\n32:00.880 --> 32:05.880\n And it was like a very structured thing.\n\n32:05.920 --> 32:07.560\n I don't know if kids do that now.\n\n32:09.080 --> 32:11.200\n If I ever have kids, they're gonna do that.\n\n32:11.200 --> 32:13.680\n And certainly, actually on the way over here,\n\n32:13.680 --> 32:16.720\n I was thinking, I was like, I really want a lot of kids.\n\n32:16.720 --> 32:18.320\n I want like a whole litter.\n\n32:18.320 --> 32:21.600\n And I was thinking, if Lex has kids and I have kids,\n\n32:21.600 --> 32:25.200\n then we can like pit them against each other with jujitsu.\n\n32:25.200 --> 32:26.800\n This is my chance at redemption.\n\n32:28.680 --> 32:30.400\n It's the law game.\n\n32:30.400 --> 32:33.120\n They'll all wanna be engineers or physicists.\n\n32:33.120 --> 32:34.640\n They won't wanna be biologists.\n\n32:35.840 --> 32:38.360\n But in all seriousness, I look forward to the day\n\n32:38.360 --> 32:41.360\n that our kids play together.\n\n32:41.360 --> 32:43.480\n Yeah, I think there's something,\n\n32:43.480 --> 32:47.200\n so the family dinner, the ritual of the family dinner,\n\n32:47.200 --> 32:49.160\n but also the special occasion dinners,\n\n32:49.160 --> 32:51.920\n like where there's a little bit more preparation,\n\n32:51.920 --> 32:53.760\n a little bit more cooking,\n\n32:53.760 --> 32:57.000\n whether it's on the weekend or for some holiday.\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.600\n In Russia, it was a thing that actually\n\n32:59.600 --> 33:02.800\n I find completely missing for the most part.\n\n33:02.800 --> 33:04.800\n In America is there was neighbors.\n\n33:04.800 --> 33:08.360\n There was a, you broke the walls\n\n33:08.360 --> 33:11.080\n between families much more commonly.\n\n33:11.080 --> 33:13.800\n Like there would be kinda regular characters,\n\n33:13.800 --> 33:15.120\n like a sitcom almost.\n\n33:15.120 --> 33:17.600\n If you watch the sitcom, it's never just the family.\n\n33:17.600 --> 33:19.200\n There's always like other characters that.\n\n33:19.200 --> 33:20.120\n Just bursting in the door.\n\n33:20.120 --> 33:20.960\n Bursting in the door.\n\n33:20.960 --> 33:22.120\n I'm gonna start doing that here,\n\n33:22.120 --> 33:22.960\n just to make you feel at home.\n\n33:22.960 --> 33:24.680\n Just start showing up at your studio.\n\n33:24.680 --> 33:25.640\n I know where you live.\n\n33:25.640 --> 33:27.520\n I think people wanna respect,\n\n33:27.520 --> 33:30.720\n like Michael Malice lives next door to me.\n\n33:30.720 --> 33:33.760\n And I think people wanna respect each other's privacy\n\n33:33.760 --> 33:34.600\n or something like that.\n\n33:34.600 --> 33:37.400\n And I think we all get super busy.\n\n33:37.400 --> 33:42.400\n And it's kind of work\n\n33:42.400 --> 33:46.080\n to do this dinner together.\n\n33:46.080 --> 33:49.760\n Or if you see it as a thing that needs to be scheduled,\n\n33:49.760 --> 33:50.600\n it's work.\n\n33:50.600 --> 33:51.440\n We get busy.\n\n33:51.440 --> 33:52.280\n There's a lot of stuff going on.\n\n33:52.280 --> 33:55.520\n But if it's part of a ritual, a part of the culture,\n\n33:55.520 --> 33:58.560\n all of those walls get broken down.\n\n33:58.560 --> 34:00.160\n And then you realize like that's,\n\n34:00.160 --> 34:03.120\n like later looking back, those are the things you miss.\n\n34:03.120 --> 34:04.880\n Like that's what life is about.\n\n34:04.880 --> 34:06.360\n Like all the stupid stuff you're doing\n\n34:06.360 --> 34:08.160\n in terms of career or whatever,\n\n34:08.160 --> 34:10.080\n all the busy things, those don't matter.\n\n34:10.080 --> 34:12.240\n What matters is the people.\n\n34:12.240 --> 34:17.080\n In academia, this changed in the last few years, of course.\n\n34:17.080 --> 34:20.800\n But one of the great joys was professors will stop by\n\n34:20.800 --> 34:21.640\n your office or your lab.\n\n34:21.640 --> 34:23.560\n Nobody set up an appointment.\n\n34:23.560 --> 34:25.480\n There was a guy when I was a professor in San Diego,\n\n34:25.480 --> 34:26.400\n a guy named Harvey Cartney,\n\n34:26.400 --> 34:28.440\n he's a member of the National Academies,\n\n34:28.440 --> 34:31.320\n truly the world's expert in the evolution of vision\n\n34:31.320 --> 34:33.720\n and evolution of brains generally.\n\n34:33.720 --> 34:35.320\n And he would show up in my lab\n\n34:35.320 --> 34:37.880\n and he would just start talking to the students in postdocs.\n\n34:37.880 --> 34:42.600\n And I mean, a pure encyclopedia.\n\n34:42.600 --> 34:43.840\n And then at some point you'd say,\n\n34:43.840 --> 34:45.080\n hey, Harvey, I gotta go.\n\n34:45.080 --> 34:46.640\n And you'd have, you'd kick him out, right?\n\n34:46.640 --> 34:49.600\n Or this guy, he's a physicist, David Klinefield,\n\n34:49.600 --> 34:50.920\n who's, same way.\n\n34:50.920 --> 34:53.040\n Actually, David Klinefield is an interesting one.\n\n34:53.040 --> 34:55.800\n A student of his went on to create\n\n34:55.800 --> 34:57.400\n the Beavis and Butthead cartoon.\n\n34:57.400 --> 34:59.360\n And one of them is David, he's a physics professor.\n\n34:59.360 --> 35:01.000\n Now people can look him up.\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.320\n And David's one of those guys who just walk into your office\n\n35:03.320 --> 35:05.400\n and you just sit down and you just start talking to you.\n\n35:05.400 --> 35:07.360\n And so there's a kind of a family field.\n\n35:07.360 --> 35:09.800\n It's like Cheers or Seinfeld or one of those shows\n\n35:09.800 --> 35:10.880\n where somebody just walks in.\n\n35:10.880 --> 35:13.720\n And yeah, I think you and I both share a love\n\n35:13.720 --> 35:14.960\n of the community around things.\n\n35:14.960 --> 35:17.720\n And podcasting is a little bit more isolated.\n\n35:17.720 --> 35:19.600\n I should say for the guest episodes,\n\n35:19.600 --> 35:21.320\n the preparation is completely different\n\n35:21.320 --> 35:22.960\n because it's more conversational.\n\n35:22.960 --> 35:24.560\n And so there, I don't do any of this business\n\n35:24.560 --> 35:26.280\n of putting myself into state.\n\n35:26.280 --> 35:30.080\n I just try and make sure that the guest is taken care of.\n\n35:30.080 --> 35:32.920\n And I do list out the questions I'm gonna ask before,\n\n35:32.920 --> 35:35.440\n but those actually really like the interview episodes\n\n35:35.440 --> 35:37.920\n far more than I like doing the solo ones.\n\n35:37.920 --> 35:39.160\n Just psychologically I mean.\n\n35:39.160 --> 35:41.520\n I just like learning from someone directly\n\n35:41.520 --> 35:44.080\n because you asking an expert about something,\n\n35:44.080 --> 35:46.680\n like sitting here with you when we recorded the podcast\n\n35:46.680 --> 35:48.560\n where you were a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast.\n\n35:48.560 --> 35:51.480\n And for the first time, and finally,\n\n35:51.480 --> 35:53.200\n someone was explaining to me the difference\n\n35:53.200 --> 35:55.160\n between machine learning, artificial intelligence\n\n35:55.160 --> 35:56.440\n and all these other things.\n\n35:56.440 --> 35:58.040\n You know, and I've finally forgiven you\n\n35:58.040 --> 36:02.400\n for making me cry about Costello on camera,\n\n36:02.400 --> 36:03.560\n because it helped me move through it.\n\n36:03.560 --> 36:06.160\n But in all seriousness, the interview ones\n\n36:06.160 --> 36:08.560\n are a sheer pleasure.\n\n36:08.560 --> 36:12.600\n The solo ones I really enjoy, but they're work.\n\n36:12.600 --> 36:14.120\n Sometimes I think like I'm gonna sweat\n\n36:14.120 --> 36:16.120\n a little blood prepping for them.\n\n36:16.120 --> 36:18.480\n Well, it's interesting because I do think prepping\n\n36:18.480 --> 36:21.160\n for interviews, having a similar process\n\n36:21.160 --> 36:23.000\n might be also very valuable.\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:26.280\n Like I have to think about that\n\n36:26.280 --> 36:31.200\n because I think when you do a conversation\n\n36:31.200 --> 36:35.000\n for several hours, especially when it's a high stakes one.\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:36.720\n So it's not like you and I know,\n\n36:36.720 --> 36:38.560\n it's more like it's just chatting and so on.\n\n36:38.560 --> 36:40.720\n The world order isn't gonna shift according to it.\n\n36:40.720 --> 36:43.320\n Although you never know, knowing you will probably\n\n36:43.320 --> 36:46.000\n be into some pretty controversial topics in a few minutes.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.080\n You like to ride the edge more than I do.\n\n36:48.080 --> 36:50.360\n There are a number of topics that I just completely avoid.\n\n36:50.360 --> 36:52.560\n And my response to those is always that\n\n36:52.560 --> 36:54.080\n I have a lot of opinions about that,\n\n36:54.080 --> 36:55.800\n but not a lot to say, you know.\n\n36:55.800 --> 37:00.720\n But whereas you've become far braver\n\n37:00.720 --> 37:02.800\n in terms of the topics you'll encounter\n\n37:02.800 --> 37:06.200\n and some of your guests have been a bit controversial.\n\n37:06.200 --> 37:11.080\n Some of them are people that a lot of people don't like.\n\n37:11.080 --> 37:13.760\n And you've been willing to just sit down\n\n37:13.760 --> 37:16.240\n and maybe it's the jujitsu thing.\n\n37:16.240 --> 37:18.080\n I don't know, it is tricky.\n\n37:18.080 --> 37:20.840\n One of my goals for this year is to talk to people\n\n37:20.840 --> 37:24.520\n that a lot of people really don't like.\n\n37:24.520 --> 37:26.200\n Are you gonna share with us?\n\n37:26.200 --> 37:27.040\n And here I am.\n\n37:27.040 --> 37:32.040\n People that are in prison, major political leaders\n\n37:34.280 --> 37:37.000\n have been thinking a lot about how to talk\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:41.280\n to really difficult, controversial figures,\n\n37:41.280 --> 37:45.160\n but find together something with them\n\n37:45.160 --> 37:47.680\n that's deeply honest about their nature,\n\n37:47.680 --> 37:52.680\n about the ideas they have about the world.\n\n37:54.280 --> 37:56.600\n Reveal something real.\n\n37:56.600 --> 37:59.440\n And some people, you have to be very careful,\n\n37:59.440 --> 38:03.560\n some people are very good at hiding the real inside them,\n\n38:03.560 --> 38:05.240\n even from themselves.\n\n38:05.240 --> 38:06.600\n That's something I think about a lot.\n\n38:06.600 --> 38:08.320\n I think about dictators of the past\n\n38:08.320 --> 38:09.960\n and I put myself in the mindset,\n\n38:09.960 --> 38:12.720\n well, how do you reveal something real\n\n38:12.720 --> 38:14.720\n about this person to themselves?\n\n38:14.720 --> 38:17.640\n I think that to me, and you kind of spoke to that,\n\n38:17.640 --> 38:22.640\n but a great conversation is one where\n\n38:22.640 --> 38:25.800\n both of you discover something new.\n\n38:28.840 --> 38:31.280\n So I love that too, that's my favorite thing\n\n38:31.280 --> 38:33.640\n what you mentioned, which is allowing your curiosity\n\n38:33.640 --> 38:35.520\n and ask all kinds of questions and get excited\n\n38:35.520 --> 38:37.240\n and to learn from an expert.\n\n38:37.240 --> 38:40.520\n But also to push them to discover something\n\n38:40.520 --> 38:44.320\n about themselves, about their ideas together.\n\n38:44.320 --> 38:48.840\n And then that discovery, and sometimes it's like,\n\n38:48.840 --> 38:53.840\n we don't see it in the moment, but the audience hears it.\n\n38:55.440 --> 38:58.240\n It's weird to say, I would compare it to\n\n38:58.240 --> 38:59.520\n when you're a musician and you're playing\n\n38:59.520 --> 39:02.080\n with other musicians, you lose yourself in the moment.\n\n39:02.080 --> 39:04.360\n Yeah, it's all, it's like, it's working right.\n\n39:04.360 --> 39:09.360\n It's working, but you don't really see the big picture\n\n39:09.800 --> 39:13.760\n impact of what it's working right actually feels like.\n\n39:13.760 --> 39:17.680\n And that's where the audience could see that.\n\n39:17.680 --> 39:19.320\n If you talk to somebody evil,\n\n39:22.920 --> 39:26.560\n for me as an interviewer, I have to empathize\n\n39:26.560 --> 39:27.560\n with that person.\n\n39:27.560 --> 39:29.840\n If I want to understand, I have to put myself\n\n39:29.840 --> 39:32.920\n in that mind space, and to put yourself in that mindset,\n\n39:32.920 --> 39:37.600\n you really have to understand the evil inside of you.\n\n39:38.560 --> 39:41.360\n Like you can't just think if somebody's in power\n\n39:41.360 --> 39:45.200\n and has used that power to abuse others,\n\n39:45.200 --> 39:48.160\n you can't just be a, I personally,\n\n39:48.160 --> 39:49.960\n a person who seeks to understand.\n\n39:49.960 --> 39:52.920\n You can't just be a journalist asking generic questions.\n\n39:52.920 --> 39:55.840\n You have to put yourself in a place\n\n39:55.840 --> 39:58.480\n where you're somebody who's given a lot of power\n\n39:58.480 --> 40:01.320\n and slowly you start to abuse that power.\n\n40:01.320 --> 40:03.280\n And what does that person become?\n\n40:03.280 --> 40:04.520\n Who are you?\n\n40:04.520 --> 40:07.200\n I have to plug myself into those moments in my life\n\n40:07.200 --> 40:09.640\n in the past where I've been angry at something\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:14.560\n and where I've been cruel because I was angry.\n\n40:14.560 --> 40:17.560\n In little ways, but then you magnify them at scale\n\n40:17.560 --> 40:21.000\n and I have to go there and that's very human.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:23.000\n And then I have to look at another person\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.200\n from across the table for me and understand,\n\n40:25.200 --> 40:26.800\n well, you're there too.\n\n40:26.800 --> 40:31.320\n And then you had more opportunity to do truly cruel things.\n\n40:31.320 --> 40:36.320\n And then where, like I have to plug myself\n\n40:36.440 --> 40:39.600\n into places where I've been, I can imagine I can go,\n\n40:39.600 --> 40:43.240\n where I was cruel to others and was unaware of it.\n\n40:43.240 --> 40:45.720\n So I was in a mind space where I was thinking\n\n40:45.720 --> 40:48.200\n that I'm doing good and I was doing not good.\n\n40:48.200 --> 40:50.280\n Again, I've never gotten the opportunity\n\n40:50.280 --> 40:52.480\n to do any of those things at large scale,\n\n40:52.480 --> 40:54.840\n but all of us have done it at a small scale.\n\n40:54.840 --> 40:58.760\n And I plug myself into that and then we're here,\n\n40:58.760 --> 41:01.480\n we're to, if it's somebody who's in prison,\n\n41:01.480 --> 41:03.400\n if it's somebody who's a dictator,\n\n41:03.400 --> 41:07.040\n we're in that space where evil is,\n\n41:07.040 --> 41:09.560\n all of us have the capacity to do that evil\n\n41:09.560 --> 41:13.480\n and I have to imagine myself being able to do that evil.\n\n41:13.480 --> 41:17.920\n And then we're here together in that dark, dark place.\n\n41:17.920 --> 41:20.000\n And then if it's just right,\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:21.800\n something real can actually come,\n\n41:21.800 --> 41:23.960\n something from that person's childhood,\n\n41:23.960 --> 41:27.640\n maybe awakening to a realization\n\n41:27.640 --> 41:30.800\n that I thought it was a good person and I'm not.\n\n41:30.800 --> 41:34.880\n And that only happens when you truly empathize.\n\n41:34.880 --> 41:36.960\n Those moments of discovery are beautiful,\n\n41:36.960 --> 41:38.720\n but they also happen in science.\n\n41:38.720 --> 41:42.360\n When you just have a conversation and you realize,\n\n41:42.360 --> 41:44.000\n I feel like talking to Stephen Wolfram,\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:46.080\n I feel like we constantly realize\n\n41:46.080 --> 41:48.040\n beautiful things together.\n\n41:48.040 --> 41:52.240\n On this element of evil and sociopathy,\n\n41:52.240 --> 41:57.240\n that Jung had this notion that we have all things inside us\n\n41:57.760 --> 42:00.800\n and that we all have the capacity to be good or evil,\n\n42:00.800 --> 42:05.160\n et cetera, but I have the good fortune\n\n42:05.160 --> 42:08.040\n of working with somebody who has deep understanding\n\n42:08.040 --> 42:10.200\n of psychiatry, but also psychoanalysis\n\n42:10.200 --> 42:11.720\n and Jungian theory.\n\n42:11.720 --> 42:15.040\n And he said to me recently, he said,\n\n42:15.040 --> 42:17.960\n whether or not all people have all things inside them\n\n42:17.960 --> 42:20.400\n is still debated in the psychology community\n\n42:20.400 --> 42:22.840\n and in the neuroscience community.\n\n42:22.840 --> 42:24.440\n And as a matter of philosophy,\n\n42:24.440 --> 42:28.240\n but there are certain people, not many,\n\n42:28.240 --> 42:29.960\n but there are certain people\n\n42:29.960 --> 42:33.280\n for whom they've actually lived out many versions\n\n42:33.280 --> 42:37.040\n of their possible selves in the first person.\n\n42:37.040 --> 42:38.760\n And so those are unique individuals.\n\n42:38.760 --> 42:41.280\n Then even if they tapped into these things,\n\n42:41.280 --> 42:44.440\n as you mentioned, at a more minor level,\n\n42:44.440 --> 42:49.000\n as opposed to impacting people negatively at scale.\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.440\n So being able to access those different parts of oneself\n\n42:51.440 --> 42:54.120\n is key and you've been willing to step into that.\n\n42:54.120 --> 42:57.480\n My podcast is not one in which we get down to those matters.\n\n42:57.480 --> 42:59.120\n Yet, yet.\n\n42:59.120 --> 43:00.560\n You never know, we might do an episode\n\n43:00.560 --> 43:02.840\n on narcissism and sociopathy.\n\n43:02.840 --> 43:04.960\n The other thing that I took away from a conversation\n\n43:04.960 --> 43:08.480\n with a friend, he was a lot of years in special operations\n\n43:08.480 --> 43:09.520\n in the intelligence community.\n\n43:09.520 --> 43:13.280\n He said, if you look at somebody's past,\n\n43:13.280 --> 43:16.280\n at some point you will come to understand\n\n43:16.280 --> 43:19.520\n some pretty good reasons as to why they became who they are,\n\n43:19.520 --> 43:21.720\n but you have to draw the, his words,\n\n43:21.720 --> 43:23.320\n the red line someplace.\n\n43:23.320 --> 43:25.040\n And what he was referring to was the fact\n\n43:25.040 --> 43:26.920\n that certain people, at least in the eyes\n\n43:26.920 --> 43:30.240\n of certain communities deserve to be eliminated\n\n43:30.240 --> 43:33.200\n as a consequence of their actions, right?\n\n43:33.200 --> 43:35.160\n Regardless of what drove them to those actions.\n\n43:35.160 --> 43:36.800\n So it gets right down to the line\n\n43:36.800 --> 43:40.800\n between nature, nurture, neuroscience,\n\n43:40.800 --> 43:43.880\n and the law and justice.\n\n43:43.880 --> 43:45.720\n Complicated, complicated themes.\n\n43:45.720 --> 43:47.040\n I can think of a number of people\n\n43:47.040 --> 43:49.240\n that I would love to hear you interview.\n\n43:49.240 --> 43:51.920\n And here I'm not revealing the reasons why,\n\n43:51.920 --> 43:53.520\n but except for the fact that I think\n\n43:53.520 --> 43:56.040\n you would be uniquely suited to bring out\n\n43:56.040 --> 43:58.480\n the important components of the conversation\n\n43:58.480 --> 44:02.600\n that other people have not been able to do,\n\n44:02.600 --> 44:04.840\n which for instance, Liz Holmes,\n\n44:04.840 --> 44:08.520\n this is one of the most mysterious\n\n44:08.520 --> 44:11.520\n and yet disliked people on the planet.\n\n44:13.640 --> 44:15.640\n She's sort of synonymous with deception.\n\n44:17.280 --> 44:20.200\n I don't know if there've been any real interviews\n\n44:20.200 --> 44:22.920\n of her since the whole thing.\n\n44:22.920 --> 44:23.920\n I haven't followed that case.\n\n44:23.920 --> 44:27.240\n I listened to the book and I followed it a little bit\n\n44:27.240 --> 44:29.400\n because it was happening in my hometown, right?\n\n44:29.400 --> 44:31.000\n Theranos was right up the road.\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:32.280\n The building's still there.\n\n44:32.280 --> 44:33.120\n It's interesting.\n\n44:33.120 --> 44:34.600\n It's some of the most premier real estate\n\n44:34.600 --> 44:36.920\n in Silicon Valley, but nobody wants it.\n\n44:36.920 --> 44:38.480\n It's sort of like, it's very hard to sell a home\n\n44:38.480 --> 44:41.080\n where somebody committed suicide or committed a murder,\n\n44:41.080 --> 44:42.560\n even if it's a beautiful home.\n\n44:42.560 --> 44:46.040\n It sort of feel like the Theranos building is that building.\n\n44:46.040 --> 44:48.520\n So that would be a really interesting interview.\n\n44:48.520 --> 44:50.560\n I would love to hear that interview.\n\n44:50.560 --> 44:55.560\n One of the most interesting dark human beings in science.\n\n44:55.760 --> 44:58.600\n Yeah, and then there'll even be people that say,\n\n44:58.600 --> 44:59.720\n was it even science, right?\n\n44:59.720 --> 45:01.120\n It might've all been deception.\n\n45:01.120 --> 45:02.360\n It might've been one part deception,\n\n45:02.360 --> 45:05.520\n one part goal setting mixed in with,\n\n45:05.520 --> 45:08.580\n clearly that there were so many factors\n\n45:08.580 --> 45:10.760\n impacting what happened.\n\n45:10.760 --> 45:15.000\n I think the big difference between Theranos and that story\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.520\n and some of the other stories about Silicon Valley\n\n45:17.520 --> 45:19.900\n where people promised a lot more than they could deliver\n\n45:19.900 --> 45:22.720\n is they were promising things that were directly related\n\n45:22.720 --> 45:23.720\n to health and healthcare.\n\n45:23.720 --> 45:26.960\n People were taking blood tests with the understanding\n\n45:26.960 --> 45:29.280\n that the data they were getting was important,\n\n45:29.280 --> 45:31.200\n information about sexually transmitted diseases\n\n45:31.200 --> 45:33.400\n and other diseases and making real world decisions\n\n45:33.400 --> 45:34.480\n on the basis of that.\n\n45:34.480 --> 45:37.240\n Whereas if you remember when the iPhone first came out\n\n45:37.240 --> 45:38.760\n and Steve Jobs was still alive\n\n45:38.760 --> 45:40.600\n and the phones were dropping calls\n\n45:40.600 --> 45:41.940\n if you held it in a particular way.\n\n45:41.940 --> 45:43.480\n And his response was a little flip.\n\n45:43.480 --> 45:45.920\n He said, hey folks, it's a phone\n\n45:45.920 --> 45:47.720\n as if like don't get so worked up.\n\n45:47.720 --> 45:51.040\n But people held them understandably to a very high standard.\n\n45:51.040 --> 45:54.080\n She sort of, it seemed, and I don't know,\n\n45:54.080 --> 45:55.360\n cause I certainly wasn't there,\n\n45:55.360 --> 45:57.820\n seemed like she sort of adopted this idea\n\n45:57.820 --> 45:59.360\n that you could get it wrong a bunch of times\n\n45:59.360 --> 46:00.960\n before you get it right.\n\n46:00.960 --> 46:02.720\n Except if the allegations are true.\n\n46:02.720 --> 46:05.760\n And I think she was found guilty, I believe,\n\n46:05.760 --> 46:07.120\n on a number of counts.\n\n46:07.120 --> 46:09.080\n That a number of the things that they were doing\n\n46:09.080 --> 46:11.880\n were impacting real world decision making.\n\n46:11.880 --> 46:14.560\n So Steve's point about the phone, it's just a phone.\n\n46:14.560 --> 46:15.400\n Well, it depends on the call.\n\n46:15.400 --> 46:18.460\n If you're calling 911, then it's not just a phone, right?\n\n46:19.360 --> 46:22.160\n But in the case of blood tests and disease,\n\n46:22.160 --> 46:23.000\n that's serious.\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:24.960\n I think that the Theranos case was super interesting to me\n\n46:24.960 --> 46:27.600\n because of the number of people from major universities\n\n46:27.600 --> 46:31.400\n and from government that both trusted her\n\n46:31.400 --> 46:34.360\n and the number of people who did not trust her\n\n46:34.360 --> 46:37.320\n and yet either didn't speak up or no one listened to them.\n\n46:37.320 --> 46:39.700\n It was only in the forensic version of it\n\n46:39.700 --> 46:42.440\n that everyone said, oh yeah, I knew that she was lying,\n\n46:42.440 --> 46:43.280\n et cetera, et cetera.\n\n46:43.280 --> 46:45.320\n They were lying to multiple people involved\n\n46:45.320 --> 46:46.680\n in those lies apparently.\n\n46:46.680 --> 46:49.120\n But I have a deep interest in the neuroscience\n\n46:49.120 --> 46:51.520\n of narcissism, sociopathy,\n\n46:51.520 --> 46:54.000\n and some of the darker aspects of the mind.\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:55.480\n So yeah, maybe someday.\n\n46:55.480 --> 46:57.080\n Maybe we'll do a podcast together.\n\n46:57.080 --> 47:00.400\n I mean, like in the kind of early 90s version of talk shows\n\n47:00.400 --> 47:02.680\n where we darken the lights and we do it together,\n\n47:02.680 --> 47:03.520\n you can use your voice\n\n47:03.520 --> 47:06.840\n because your voice is much more sinister sounding than mine.\n\n47:06.840 --> 47:07.940\n Good cop, bad cop.\n\n47:08.800 --> 47:11.440\n Well, it'd be interesting from a scientific perspective\n\n47:11.440 --> 47:15.740\n of somebody who is a sociopath or a psychopath,\n\n47:16.780 --> 47:20.200\n how to reveal something real about them.\n\n47:20.200 --> 47:24.480\n I think that requires not just,\n\n47:24.480 --> 47:26.520\n well, I don't know what that requires.\n\n47:26.520 --> 47:27.920\n That requires the same skill\n\n47:27.920 --> 47:31.620\n that it takes to be a good therapist.\n\n47:31.620 --> 47:35.140\n Right, and some therapists won't work with sociopaths\n\n47:35.140 --> 47:38.420\n because they don't feel any progress can be made.\n\n47:38.420 --> 47:40.400\n Some therapists will work with sociopaths\n\n47:40.400 --> 47:41.960\n because for the wealthy ones,\n\n47:41.960 --> 47:44.900\n they often, they want their money.\n\n47:44.900 --> 47:47.360\n I think most therapists are good and benevolent,\n\n47:47.360 --> 47:48.320\n but there's some that will do it\n\n47:48.320 --> 47:50.480\n just the same way lawyers will work with criminals\n\n47:50.480 --> 47:52.120\n knowing they're criminals, right?\n\n47:53.440 --> 47:55.320\n Oftentimes because they're criminals.\n\n47:55.320 --> 47:57.000\n There are certain domains of psychiatry\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:59.760\n that are more tractable than others, right?\n\n47:59.760 --> 48:00.720\n Borderlines are interesting.\n\n48:00.720 --> 48:01.560\n I should just mention\n\n48:01.560 --> 48:03.860\n because they have this phenomenon of splitting.\n\n48:03.860 --> 48:05.740\n So in the world of psychology,\n\n48:05.740 --> 48:09.960\n the idea is that being neurotic is actually the goal.\n\n48:09.960 --> 48:12.360\n The idea that you could be, you know,\n\n48:12.360 --> 48:15.100\n feel something and then work a lot to overcome it\n\n48:15.100 --> 48:18.760\n or have some sort of defense mechanism in place,\n\n48:18.760 --> 48:20.340\n but that's not destructive.\n\n48:20.340 --> 48:22.560\n That's actually a pretty healthy state to be in.\n\n48:22.560 --> 48:25.380\n It's provided it's not destructive.\n\n48:25.380 --> 48:29.800\n Psychotic is truly delusional thinking about reality.\n\n48:29.800 --> 48:31.980\n And the idea is that borderlines split,\n\n48:33.120 --> 48:37.340\n intermittently split between psychotic and neurotic.\n\n48:37.340 --> 48:38.180\n That's why it was called,\n\n48:38.180 --> 48:41.000\n there's beautiful work by Melanie Klein that describes this,\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:42.980\n which I'm just now kind of delving into.\n\n48:42.980 --> 48:46.020\n But, you know, so the borderline is the person who is like,\n\n48:46.020 --> 48:47.520\n I love you, I love you, I love you,\n\n48:47.520 --> 48:49.720\n and then truly feels as if they hate you\n\n48:49.720 --> 48:51.320\n and you become the bad object.\n\n48:51.320 --> 48:54.580\n So borderlines are challenging for psychologists\n\n48:54.580 --> 48:56.460\n because of the splitting, right?\n\n48:57.500 --> 48:58.780\n Schizophrenics are challenging\n\n48:58.780 --> 49:02.940\n because of the detachment from reality.\n\n49:02.940 --> 49:05.120\n And narcissists are challenging\n\n49:05.120 --> 49:07.620\n because they're often so charming\n\n49:07.620 --> 49:10.060\n that even the therapists are charmed.\n\n49:10.060 --> 49:12.280\n I believe you mentioned Karl Deisseroth.\n\n49:12.280 --> 49:13.120\n We'll talk about him.\n\n49:13.120 --> 49:14.460\n He was definitely not a narcissist.\n\n49:14.460 --> 49:16.420\n He's one of the more humble people, but he is brilliant.\n\n49:16.420 --> 49:17.900\n Thanks again to you.\n\n49:17.900 --> 49:19.420\n You've connected us.\n\n49:19.420 --> 49:22.820\n I had the pleasure of having a conversation with him.\n\n49:22.820 --> 49:23.900\n You had a conversation with him.\n\n49:23.900 --> 49:25.660\n I really enjoyed it on the podcast.\n\n49:25.660 --> 49:29.740\n You guys come from the same science, from the same place,\n\n49:29.740 --> 49:31.500\n maybe different journeys, fascinating.\n\n49:31.500 --> 49:32.340\n And levels.\n\n49:32.340 --> 49:33.940\n We were postdocs together.\n\n49:33.940 --> 49:37.860\n Karl is truly the Michael Jordan, the Wayne Gretzky,\n\n49:37.860 --> 49:40.420\n five children, amazing marriage to it.\n\n49:40.420 --> 49:41.940\n Also an amazing scientist.\n\n49:41.940 --> 49:42.940\n His wife, Michelle Monge,\n\n49:42.940 --> 49:44.940\n is in our neurology department at Stanford.\n\n49:44.940 --> 49:49.940\n An incredible thinker, writer, very kind person, humble.\n\n49:51.500 --> 49:52.740\n Speaking of getting into state,\n\n49:52.740 --> 49:54.300\n sorry, Karl, I'm gonna out you on this,\n\n49:54.300 --> 49:58.340\n but Karl, despite being at the highest levels\n\n49:58.340 --> 50:01.420\n of science and engineering and a practicing psychiatrist,\n\n50:02.300 --> 50:06.200\n his office is literally a coat closet\n\n50:06.200 --> 50:07.900\n with a small table lamp.\n\n50:07.900 --> 50:10.220\n When you meet with Karl, if you manage to meet with him,\n\n50:10.220 --> 50:12.300\n because he's very hard to get to,\n\n50:12.300 --> 50:13.700\n you walk in, you sit down\n\n50:13.700 --> 50:15.700\n as if you're going through some interrogation\n\n50:15.700 --> 50:18.100\n and some spy novel.\n\n50:18.100 --> 50:22.100\n And he'll ask you, what are you most excited about lately?\n\n50:22.100 --> 50:23.980\n And I've got 11 minutes or something.\n\n50:23.980 --> 50:27.040\n And that's a meeting with Karl, because he's that busy.\n\n50:27.040 --> 50:29.300\n But he doesn't have the office with the pictures of the kids\n\n50:29.300 --> 50:30.800\n and the thing and all that.\n\n50:30.800 --> 50:32.540\n All that is kept elsewhere.\n\n50:32.540 --> 50:34.420\n So in order to get, I asked him\n\n50:34.420 --> 50:36.020\n why he work in this office, right?\n\n50:36.020 --> 50:38.060\n You work on light and channels of light,\n\n50:38.060 --> 50:39.820\n things related to light of all things.\n\n50:39.820 --> 50:40.740\n Here you are in this dark room.\n\n50:40.740 --> 50:41.940\n And he said, well, this is what gets me\n\n50:41.940 --> 50:44.260\n into the state of mind to be able to do what I want to do.\n\n50:44.260 --> 50:48.860\n Very Rick Rubin ish, not at all the same person,\n\n50:48.860 --> 50:50.600\n but very similar in that he's figured out\n\n50:50.600 --> 50:52.380\n the physical space he needs in order to get\n\n50:52.380 --> 50:54.540\n into the optimal state to do the work he needs to do\n\n50:54.540 --> 50:55.460\n in this lifetime.\n\n50:55.460 --> 50:57.460\n And it's very unusual, right?\n\n50:57.460 --> 50:59.340\n If I don't have a window, I kind of freak out.\n\n50:59.340 --> 51:00.540\n I can do it here for a while.\n\n51:00.540 --> 51:03.960\n We're in this black cube here, floating in space, of course.\n\n51:05.380 --> 51:08.900\n But I find that amazing that these people\n\n51:08.900 --> 51:10.820\n that are operating in this super high level\n\n51:10.820 --> 51:12.580\n are willing to actually deprive themselves\n\n51:12.580 --> 51:14.040\n of a lot of conditions.\n\n51:14.040 --> 51:16.580\n They're not sitting there with the secretary coming in\n\n51:16.580 --> 51:19.100\n offering them espresso every five minutes and things that,\n\n51:19.100 --> 51:21.940\n no, no, no, that's New York Neuroscience.\n\n51:21.940 --> 51:23.980\n The New York Neuroscience Mafia is kind of famous\n\n51:23.980 --> 51:28.160\n for having all the tickets to the opera and this and that.\n\n51:28.160 --> 51:30.180\n And they enjoy lifestyle a lot.\n\n51:30.180 --> 51:31.500\n The New York Neuroscience Mafia.\n\n51:31.500 --> 51:32.980\n Oh, there is one, there definitely is one.\n\n51:32.980 --> 51:34.380\n They know who they are.\n\n51:34.380 --> 51:35.220\n They know who they are.\n\n51:35.220 --> 51:38.940\n People don't know, Andrew Huberman is from the West Coast\n\n51:38.940 --> 51:41.620\n and now he's just starting wars with the Neuroscience Mafia.\n\n51:41.620 --> 51:42.660\n Well, they do amazing science.\n\n51:42.660 --> 51:45.520\n They think, they love their lifestyle and that's wonderful,\n\n51:45.520 --> 51:47.120\n but the culture is very different.\n\n51:48.380 --> 51:50.560\n Carl and I think Silicon Valley in general\n\n51:50.560 --> 51:55.300\n kind of prides itself on this kind of monk like assesism,\n\n51:55.300 --> 51:56.140\n right?\n\n51:56.140 --> 51:57.820\n But at the individual scale,\n\n51:57.820 --> 51:59.700\n be deliberate about controlling the environment.\n\n51:59.700 --> 52:01.860\n I think about that with the conversations too.\n\n52:01.860 --> 52:04.160\n I haven't been deliberate about that either\n\n52:04.160 --> 52:07.460\n in terms of controlling the space you're in.\n\n52:07.460 --> 52:10.680\n Visually, yes, black curtains, all those kinds of things.\n\n52:10.680 --> 52:13.820\n There is nothing like the Lex Friedman podcast studio.\n\n52:14.820 --> 52:17.180\n First of all, when you do them remotely,\n\n52:17.180 --> 52:20.620\n I always feel like I'm in a witness relocation program.\n\n52:20.620 --> 52:23.140\n You only get the coordinates at the last moment\n\n52:23.140 --> 52:26.260\n and you always get the sense that there are people\n\n52:26.260 --> 52:30.140\n behind the walls that are recording things.\n\n52:30.140 --> 52:32.620\n Well, there's something about creating a feeling.\n\n52:32.620 --> 52:34.460\n I have a sense that there's a robot over there.\n\n52:34.460 --> 52:36.580\n There's several throughout this place.\n\n52:36.580 --> 52:41.500\n And I think part of that,\n\n52:42.860 --> 52:46.220\n part of creating a feeling would be having the robots\n\n52:46.220 --> 52:49.960\n constantly moving around and having a mind of their own\n\n52:49.960 --> 52:54.660\n because that would most closely put guests\n\n52:54.660 --> 52:58.080\n and other humans that I interact with into a place\n\n52:58.080 --> 53:01.460\n that's closest to my mind\n\n53:01.460 --> 53:03.940\n because it's such an engineering mind\n\n53:03.940 --> 53:06.500\n and one where when things come to life,\n\n53:06.500 --> 53:08.460\n it's a beautiful place to be.\n\n53:08.460 --> 53:10.700\n And whatever that is, that could be like art,\n\n53:10.700 --> 53:12.620\n but to me, robots are art.\n\n53:12.620 --> 53:17.300\n And so I'm thinking about that both for me and for guests.\n\n53:17.300 --> 53:19.900\n And I'm also thinking about the difficult guests\n\n53:19.900 --> 53:22.540\n just to return to, you said, Elizabeth Holmes.\n\n53:22.540 --> 53:26.460\n One person, maybe a couple of things I want to say.\n\n53:26.460 --> 53:31.660\n One person I think I would like to talk to is\n\n53:32.800 --> 53:34.300\n Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n53:34.300 --> 53:36.380\n I always get afraid right before you reveal\n\n53:36.380 --> 53:37.220\n these kinds of things.\n\n53:37.220 --> 53:39.020\n And now I know why I get afraid.\n\n53:39.020 --> 53:42.220\n Yeah, I mean, again, assuming that she did the things\n\n53:42.220 --> 53:45.900\n that people claim she did, they're despicable, right?\n\n53:45.900 --> 53:48.020\n I mean, these were underage children, right?\n\n53:48.020 --> 53:50.500\n There's just no version of the story\n\n53:50.500 --> 53:54.580\n where she did the things she was accused of doing\n\n53:54.580 --> 53:56.600\n and is still a quote unquote good person.\n\n53:56.600 --> 53:58.400\n There's just, in my mind, right?\n\n53:59.260 --> 54:01.780\n And yet I think there is tremendous interest\n\n54:01.780 --> 54:05.980\n in understanding like what led her to do all that.\n\n54:05.980 --> 54:07.300\n So at least for some people.\n\n54:07.300 --> 54:08.180\n Let me say a couple of things.\n\n54:08.180 --> 54:13.180\n So one is at a high level, let me say that she believes\n\n54:14.860 --> 54:18.900\n or her current story is that she's the victim.\n\n54:18.900 --> 54:20.060\n Of who?\n\n54:20.060 --> 54:21.020\n Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n54:21.020 --> 54:21.860\n Oh my.\n\n54:23.160 --> 54:26.780\n I think I'll just leave that there as is.\n\n54:26.780 --> 54:29.920\n So these are ideas that you're facing.\n\n54:31.380 --> 54:34.700\n The nature of truth and the nature of the human mind\n\n54:34.700 --> 54:38.940\n is what it is and this is, imagine folks,\n\n54:38.940 --> 54:43.060\n if you went into a room with a person that says that,\n\n54:43.060 --> 54:44.240\n what do you do next?\n\n54:45.200 --> 54:50.200\n Let me also say that I never or rarely,\n\n54:51.100 --> 54:54.500\n let me say not say never, I rarely mention names\n\n54:54.500 --> 54:57.240\n that I'm interested in talking to\n\n54:57.240 --> 55:00.880\n without having made significant progress\n\n55:00.880 --> 55:03.180\n in already securing that interview.\n\n55:03.180 --> 55:07.640\n So people sometimes ask me about Vladimir Zelensky\n\n55:07.640 --> 55:09.700\n and Vladimir Putin.\n\n55:09.700 --> 55:14.700\n I do not bring them up lightly in terms of their being\n\n55:15.800 --> 55:17.220\n a path to an actual conversation.\n\n55:17.220 --> 55:20.140\n That said, something I regret but I'm not sure\n\n55:20.140 --> 55:23.740\n I know what to do with it.\n\n55:23.740 --> 55:27.380\n But in the case of all the people I just mentioned,\n\n55:27.380 --> 55:30.540\n I haven't been preparing for those conversations.\n\n55:30.540 --> 55:35.100\n I only start really preparing seriously\n\n55:35.100 --> 55:40.100\n when it's confirmed because it's such a heavy burden.\n\n55:40.340 --> 55:44.300\n And one of the things I regret in having mentioned\n\n55:44.300 --> 55:47.260\n a conversation with Vladimir Putin\n\n55:47.260 --> 55:51.220\n before the war in Ukraine broke out in the past few years\n\n55:51.220 --> 55:55.780\n is that I would mention it very loosely, very casually.\n\n55:55.780 --> 56:00.780\n And without having really deeply put myself into a place\n\n56:01.380 --> 56:02.940\n that I'm ready to talk to him.\n\n56:02.940 --> 56:07.460\n And that's a tricky thing because then the internet,\n\n56:08.500 --> 56:11.640\n the audience in general, and just me,\n\n56:11.640 --> 56:14.380\n when I listen back to my dumb self,\n\n56:14.380 --> 56:16.280\n think, well, why are you speaking so lightly\n\n56:16.280 --> 56:17.740\n about these topics?\n\n56:17.740 --> 56:19.540\n Well, I know you've had a longstanding interest\n\n56:19.540 --> 56:21.620\n in talking to him.\n\n56:21.620 --> 56:25.860\n I think now, well, I don't understand\n\n56:27.120 --> 56:31.200\n how I would sit down and have a conversation\n\n56:31.200 --> 56:32.140\n with somebody like that,\n\n56:32.140 --> 56:36.380\n but that's not in the range of my skill sets.\n\n56:36.380 --> 56:39.940\n Or like maybe not in the range of things\n\n56:39.940 --> 56:41.980\n that you're drawn to somehow.\n\n56:41.980 --> 56:42.820\n Not so much.\n\n56:42.820 --> 56:46.240\n I mean, I would watch that episode with great interest.\n\n56:47.380 --> 56:49.700\n Well, you did an episode recently with this guy\n\n56:49.700 --> 56:53.940\n who was a former cyber criminal turned state side, right?\n\n56:53.940 --> 56:55.220\n I think he works for the government now.\n\n56:55.220 --> 56:57.360\n And there was a segment in there.\n\n56:57.360 --> 56:58.200\n Remind me his name?\n\n56:58.200 --> 56:59.040\n Brett Johnson.\n\n56:59.040 --> 56:59.860\n Brett Johnson.\n\n56:59.860 --> 57:02.260\n There was a segment in there where he talked about\n\n57:02.260 --> 57:06.140\n stealing a lifetime's worth of collected coins\n\n57:06.140 --> 57:08.780\n from some elderly woman.\n\n57:08.780 --> 57:10.220\n And this was everything she had.\n\n57:10.220 --> 57:15.220\n And then he openly admitted that he felt no remorse,\n\n57:15.660 --> 57:18.540\n which is the way he described is purely sociopathic.\n\n57:18.540 --> 57:20.660\n And then of course we learned that he grew up in a family\n\n57:20.660 --> 57:23.140\n where criminal behavior was very common.\n\n57:23.140 --> 57:25.820\n It was kind of embedded into his notions\n\n57:25.820 --> 57:27.700\n of what typical behaviors were.\n\n57:27.700 --> 57:30.580\n And I found myself somewhat conflicted,\n\n57:30.580 --> 57:33.540\n but also hung up on this idea that,\n\n57:33.540 --> 57:37.500\n I mean, he had behaved as a sociopath\n\n57:38.420 --> 57:39.960\n or in a sociopathic way.\n\n57:39.960 --> 57:42.580\n And it created an internal conflict\n\n57:42.580 --> 57:44.020\n because he's quite charming guest\n\n57:44.020 --> 57:45.860\n and his stories are terrific.\n\n57:45.860 --> 57:49.180\n Especially I really enjoyed his discussions\n\n57:49.180 --> 57:52.740\n about how he would go out and do all these things\n\n57:52.740 --> 57:56.460\n out of a desire to please his girlfriend.\n\n57:56.460 --> 57:58.280\n So he was in service to other people,\n\n57:58.280 --> 57:59.420\n despite being sociopathic,\n\n57:59.420 --> 58:01.780\n he could say he was in service to them as a way to extract.\n\n58:01.780 --> 58:03.260\n Gets very complicated.\n\n58:03.260 --> 58:05.140\n I think is the reason I went into science\n\n58:05.140 --> 58:07.340\n is that at some level,\n\n58:07.340 --> 58:10.500\n it's more about facts than it is opinions and judgments.\n\n58:10.500 --> 58:12.100\n And I don't know that I have the ability\n\n58:12.100 --> 58:16.540\n to suspend judgment away from the kind of\n\n58:16.540 --> 58:19.460\n top level contours of my initial reaction to like,\n\n58:20.300 --> 58:22.420\n if it's true, like the Ghislaine Maxwell's\n\n58:22.420 --> 58:25.340\n and the Liz Holmes and the other sociopaths\n\n58:25.340 --> 58:28.220\n is one of just kind of revulsion and repulsion.\n\n58:28.220 --> 58:29.740\n But that could also reflect the fact\n\n58:29.740 --> 58:33.660\n that I'm not as neurologically sophisticated\n\n58:33.660 --> 58:38.660\n as somebody that can spin all the plates of empathy,\n\n58:38.660 --> 58:43.660\n forgiveness, but also holding people accountable\n\n58:44.140 --> 58:44.980\n at the same time.\n\n58:44.980 --> 58:45.820\n That's work.\n\n58:45.820 --> 58:46.820\n That takes, if you think about it,\n\n58:46.820 --> 58:50.700\n that's three four brain circuits having to work in parallel.\n\n58:50.700 --> 58:52.700\n That's the difference between chess or a game of go\n\n58:52.700 --> 58:53.540\n and a game of checkers.\n\n58:53.540 --> 58:56.020\n I guess I'm playing checkers and you're playing chess.\n\n58:56.020 --> 58:58.500\n No, so one is actually holding in your mind\n\n58:58.500 --> 59:01.160\n and two is the raw skill of conversation.\n\n59:01.160 --> 59:04.020\n You're very, just having listened to your interviews,\n\n59:04.020 --> 59:05.620\n you're very good at conversation,\n\n59:05.620 --> 59:08.940\n but the skill of conversation is really tricky.\n\n59:08.940 --> 59:10.300\n I'm not being self deprecating.\n\n59:10.300 --> 59:12.060\n I'm being just objective.\n\n59:12.060 --> 59:15.540\n I'm not good at conversation.\n\n59:15.540 --> 59:18.780\n I'm working very hard, getting better at it.\n\n59:18.780 --> 59:22.660\n I'm speaking not about just podcasting.\n\n59:22.660 --> 59:25.380\n I'm speaking just normal life.\n\n59:25.380 --> 59:30.260\n I have anxiety from social interaction.\n\n59:30.260 --> 59:31.100\n I...\n\n59:31.100 --> 59:31.940\n Do you really?\n\n59:31.940 --> 59:33.060\n A huge amount, yeah, yeah.\n\n59:33.060 --> 59:37.260\n So this is interesting because I never detect that in you.\n\n59:37.260 --> 59:38.100\n Ever.\n\n59:38.100 --> 59:40.660\n And I think there are people that we both know\n\n59:40.660 --> 59:45.180\n that have said to me that they too feel anxious\n\n59:45.180 --> 59:49.500\n and yet your voice is steady.\n\n59:49.500 --> 59:51.460\n I don't see any perspiration.\n\n59:51.460 --> 59:52.740\n Oh yeah.\n\n59:52.740 --> 59:54.060\n You appear incredibly calm.\n\n59:54.060 --> 59:55.380\n I'm scared shitless.\n\n59:55.380 --> 59:57.500\n I was scared shitless with Rick Rubin.\n\n59:57.500 --> 1:00:00.940\n Rick Rubin is, when you first meet him,\n\n1:00:00.940 --> 1:00:03.300\n is intimidatingly calm.\n\n1:00:03.300 --> 1:00:04.540\n But as you get to know him a bit,\n\n1:00:04.540 --> 1:00:07.340\n you realize that the kindness\n\n1:00:07.340 --> 1:00:09.740\n and the generosity that you sense is real.\n\n1:00:11.420 --> 1:00:14.660\n But yeah, I would never in a million years\n\n1:00:14.660 --> 1:00:16.740\n have guessed that you get anxious in conversation.\n\n1:00:16.740 --> 1:00:19.100\n Can I just make another quick comment?\n\n1:00:19.100 --> 1:00:22.380\n This may come off entertaining to you, Andrew.\n\n1:00:22.380 --> 1:00:24.260\n Maybe you've already gotten the same.\n\n1:00:24.260 --> 1:00:31.260\n But having mentioned Vladimir Putin, Vladimir Zelensky,\n\n1:00:31.260 --> 1:00:37.260\n Ghislaine Maxwell, there is a natural question.\n\n1:00:37.260 --> 1:00:43.260\n How does Lex have access to these people?\n\n1:00:43.260 --> 1:00:45.540\n Who does he work for?\n\n1:00:45.540 --> 1:00:48.060\n Like how does he...\n\n1:00:48.060 --> 1:00:49.420\n Or who works for him.\n\n1:00:49.420 --> 1:00:50.580\n Who works for him.\n\n1:00:50.580 --> 1:00:51.420\n Right.\n\n1:00:51.420 --> 1:00:52.940\n What does he have on others?\n\n1:00:52.940 --> 1:00:55.780\n This, I'm actually, I ask myself,\n\n1:00:55.780 --> 1:00:57.820\n when I look in the mirror,\n\n1:00:57.820 --> 1:01:01.980\n just somebody who kind of enjoys conspiracy theories,\n\n1:01:01.980 --> 1:01:03.300\n I want to ask the same question.\n\n1:01:03.300 --> 1:01:05.500\n Like, well, I usually ask in the following way,\n\n1:01:05.500 --> 1:01:07.220\n like, how the fuck am I so lucky?\n\n1:01:07.220 --> 1:01:11.100\n Like, who am I being, am I a robot\n\n1:01:11.100 --> 1:01:12.540\n being controlled by somebody else?\n\n1:01:12.540 --> 1:01:16.340\n Or like, how is this my life right now?\n\n1:01:16.340 --> 1:01:17.180\n What is happening?\n\n1:01:17.180 --> 1:01:18.780\n It really does feel like a simulation.\n\n1:01:18.780 --> 1:01:22.060\n So let me just speak to several things.\n\n1:01:22.060 --> 1:01:25.300\n First of all, I have no boss.\n\n1:01:25.300 --> 1:01:29.180\n I know of nor am I controlled\n\n1:01:29.180 --> 1:01:32.460\n by any intelligence agencies of any nation.\n\n1:01:32.460 --> 1:01:34.940\n We're going to get you a dog, Lex.\n\n1:01:34.940 --> 1:01:37.140\n So that I could talk to.\n\n1:01:37.140 --> 1:01:38.420\n I'm scared of getting a dog\n\n1:01:38.420 --> 1:01:41.580\n because I would fall in love so deeply, I think.\n\n1:01:41.580 --> 1:01:43.700\n Next time I'm bringing a puppy.\n\n1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:44.540\n I'm just going to bring a puppy\n\n1:01:44.540 --> 1:01:46.900\n and I'm going to leave it here.\n\n1:01:46.900 --> 1:01:48.540\n And then you'll never see me again.\n\n1:01:48.540 --> 1:01:50.300\n I mean, I love dogs so much.\n\n1:01:50.300 --> 1:01:54.420\n But I was also surprised and maybe,\n\n1:01:55.740 --> 1:02:00.540\n I have never talked to an intelligence agency,\n\n1:02:00.540 --> 1:02:02.380\n which is very interesting to me.\n\n1:02:02.380 --> 1:02:03.500\n Like, I haven't.\n\n1:02:03.500 --> 1:02:05.060\n That you're aware of.\n\n1:02:05.060 --> 1:02:07.780\n Cause they're very good at communicating.\n\n1:02:07.780 --> 1:02:08.620\n Right.\n\n1:02:08.620 --> 1:02:10.980\n But I've been very suspicious on this exact point.\n\n1:02:10.980 --> 1:02:15.500\n That's the downside of kind of being an introvert,\n\n1:02:15.500 --> 1:02:17.460\n having anxiety about social interaction,\n\n1:02:17.460 --> 1:02:20.180\n but then having so much love thrown your way\n\n1:02:20.180 --> 1:02:21.860\n because we connect over podcasts.\n\n1:02:21.860 --> 1:02:24.540\n Podcasts have a powerful way of connecting people.\n\n1:02:24.540 --> 1:02:28.220\n So people come with you with love that I really love.\n\n1:02:28.220 --> 1:02:32.220\n I appreciate, but I wonder like exactly this question,\n\n1:02:32.220 --> 1:02:37.220\n like why is this person with a Russian accent talking to me\n\n1:02:37.380 --> 1:02:39.180\n and showing me so much love?\n\n1:02:39.180 --> 1:02:41.100\n Well, because, sorry to interrupt you again,\n\n1:02:41.100 --> 1:02:42.820\n but it's what we do.\n\n1:02:44.100 --> 1:02:46.340\n And it's a sign of interest, by the way, too.\n\n1:02:46.340 --> 1:02:47.620\n Sometimes. Sometimes.\n\n1:02:47.620 --> 1:02:49.020\n Yeah, I have a colleague at Stanford\n\n1:02:49.020 --> 1:02:53.260\n and she said, you know, interruption 75% of the time\n\n1:02:53.260 --> 1:02:55.740\n is a sign of real interest in what the person is saying,\n\n1:02:55.740 --> 1:02:56.660\n if nothing else.\n\n1:02:57.540 --> 1:03:00.740\n Well, you're very lovable.\n\n1:03:00.740 --> 1:03:01.660\n Well, that, that, but,\n\n1:03:01.660 --> 1:03:04.460\n I mean, I learned about a hedgehog in the fog from you.\n\n1:03:04.460 --> 1:03:05.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:05.300 --> 1:03:07.940\n You know, when I learned, you know, you're very lovable.\n\n1:03:07.940 --> 1:03:09.700\n People love you because you're lovable.\n\n1:03:09.700 --> 1:03:10.540\n I love, love.\n\n1:03:10.540 --> 1:03:12.460\n Okay. So 100%.\n\n1:03:12.460 --> 1:03:14.780\n And it's, I mean, especially here in Austin, Texas,\n\n1:03:14.780 --> 1:03:17.060\n people are so, so amazing.\n\n1:03:17.060 --> 1:03:19.780\n I go just hugs and just, ah, I love people.\n\n1:03:19.780 --> 1:03:20.740\n Do you want a family?\n\n1:03:20.740 --> 1:03:21.580\n Or are you eventually?\n\n1:03:21.580 --> 1:03:22.420\n 100%.\n\n1:03:22.420 --> 1:03:25.220\n I mean, you're, I take what you said as a challenge\n\n1:03:26.140 --> 1:03:28.860\n in terms of having a family with kids\n\n1:03:28.860 --> 1:03:32.220\n and they do jiu jitsu and obviously defeat you\n\n1:03:32.220 --> 1:03:37.220\n and make you miserable for your failures as a father\n\n1:03:37.220 --> 1:03:38.220\n because you couldn't.\n\n1:03:39.540 --> 1:03:40.900\n But you're gonna be a great dad.\n\n1:03:40.900 --> 1:03:43.060\n Build up an army of good jiu jitsu people.\n\n1:03:43.060 --> 1:03:44.820\n But yes, I would love a family.\n\n1:03:44.820 --> 1:03:47.100\n I would love to have children.\n\n1:03:47.100 --> 1:03:49.580\n But I just want to finish that point\n\n1:03:49.580 --> 1:03:50.580\n because I'm nervous about it.\n\n1:03:50.580 --> 1:03:52.780\n I'm nervous about the way people perceive.\n\n1:03:52.780 --> 1:03:54.940\n What you're seeing is a Forrest Gump type character.\n\n1:03:54.940 --> 1:03:58.100\n Like what, who I am, I seem to be,\n\n1:03:58.100 --> 1:04:00.700\n and this is how like the world seems to work,\n\n1:04:00.700 --> 1:04:03.420\n is you just try, you try to be yourself.\n\n1:04:03.420 --> 1:04:05.540\n Like you try to find yourself.\n\n1:04:05.540 --> 1:04:07.220\n That's maybe the better way to say it.\n\n1:04:07.220 --> 1:04:09.420\n And just be that.\n\n1:04:10.740 --> 1:04:12.620\n Be kind to people.\n\n1:04:12.620 --> 1:04:14.580\n Work your ass off.\n\n1:04:14.580 --> 1:04:19.460\n And say F you to anybody that wants to control you\n\n1:04:19.460 --> 1:04:21.460\n or to tell you what to do.\n\n1:04:21.460 --> 1:04:22.700\n Just be free.\n\n1:04:22.700 --> 1:04:24.500\n And then put love out there in the world.\n\n1:04:24.500 --> 1:04:25.380\n And doors open.\n\n1:04:25.380 --> 1:04:27.660\n This karma thing seems to work.\n\n1:04:28.780 --> 1:04:32.820\n Like how the hell, my friends as you know,\n\n1:04:32.820 --> 1:04:35.620\n how the hell did I get a chance to eat barbecue\n\n1:04:35.620 --> 1:04:37.060\n with Rick Rubin, right?\n\n1:04:37.060 --> 1:04:38.180\n Like doors.\n\n1:04:38.180 --> 1:04:39.020\n You guys had a barbecue?\n\n1:04:39.020 --> 1:04:40.380\n Yeah, I had barbecue.\n\n1:04:40.380 --> 1:04:42.420\n He, right, of course I did.\n\n1:04:42.420 --> 1:04:43.260\n He's from New York.\n\n1:04:43.260 --> 1:04:46.900\n Any New Yorker that I know has very high standards for food\n\n1:04:46.900 --> 1:04:49.300\n because bad restaurants don't last long in New York.\n\n1:04:49.300 --> 1:04:50.780\n And barbecue counts as?\n\n1:04:50.780 --> 1:04:51.620\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:04:51.620 --> 1:04:52.860\n Oh yeah, Texas barbecue.\n\n1:04:52.860 --> 1:04:56.780\n Well, you know, I would also add that you,\n\n1:04:56.780 --> 1:04:57.900\n whether or not you realize it or not,\n\n1:04:57.900 --> 1:04:59.460\n you took tremendous risk.\n\n1:04:59.460 --> 1:05:01.260\n I mean, we come from the same original community,\n\n1:05:01.260 --> 1:05:03.220\n which is academic science, right?\n\n1:05:03.220 --> 1:05:07.620\n And to be at MIT and to start posting lectures online\n\n1:05:07.620 --> 1:05:09.460\n is risky, right?\n\n1:05:09.460 --> 1:05:12.700\n To, you know, I was third or fourth man in\n\n1:05:12.700 --> 1:05:14.620\n in terms of podcasting as an academic.\n\n1:05:14.620 --> 1:05:16.980\n Cause you had gone on Rogan many times,\n\n1:05:16.980 --> 1:05:18.500\n David Sinclair had gone on there.\n\n1:05:18.500 --> 1:05:22.580\n You know, especially before the pandemic,\n\n1:05:22.580 --> 1:05:24.340\n you just didn't see many academics and scientists\n\n1:05:24.340 --> 1:05:26.900\n talking in a public facing way.\n\n1:05:26.900 --> 1:05:29.020\n So you took tremendous risk, right?\n\n1:05:29.020 --> 1:05:30.180\n You took tremendous risk\n\n1:05:30.180 --> 1:05:33.380\n always wearing that jacket and tie, right?\n\n1:05:33.380 --> 1:05:35.020\n The only time I haven't seen you in that truly\n\n1:05:35.020 --> 1:05:36.820\n is when we rolled jujitsu, which is,\n\n1:05:36.820 --> 1:05:38.420\n and I hear I'm being generous to myself saying\n\n1:05:38.420 --> 1:05:40.300\n I rolled jujitsu when basically you choked me out\n\n1:05:40.300 --> 1:05:41.140\n in front of hundreds of people.\n\n1:05:41.140 --> 1:05:41.980\n Thank you for doing that.\n\n1:05:41.980 --> 1:05:44.700\n It was, it was great fun.\n\n1:05:44.700 --> 1:05:45.780\n And I...\n\n1:05:45.780 --> 1:05:46.700\n Thank you for doing that.\n\n1:05:46.700 --> 1:05:48.620\n To have a beginner's mind is a beautiful thing.\n\n1:05:48.620 --> 1:05:51.260\n I have admittedly, I have not been taking the classes,\n\n1:05:51.260 --> 1:05:54.060\n but I'm going to, I truly am.\n\n1:05:54.060 --> 1:05:56.620\n Especially there's a small chance I might find myself\n\n1:05:56.620 --> 1:05:59.420\n in Austin a bit more often in the near future.\n\n1:05:59.420 --> 1:06:00.380\n But the...\n\n1:06:00.380 --> 1:06:01.620\n Well, if you're out in San Francisco,\n\n1:06:01.620 --> 1:06:02.860\n you should train with Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n1:06:02.860 --> 1:06:04.220\n He just started, so there you go.\n\n1:06:04.220 --> 1:06:05.060\n Oh yeah?\n\n1:06:05.060 --> 1:06:05.900\n You guys can...\n\n1:06:05.900 --> 1:06:06.740\n Interesting.\n\n1:06:07.940 --> 1:06:09.180\n Sure.\n\n1:06:09.180 --> 1:06:10.540\n I mean, he's actually,\n\n1:06:10.540 --> 1:06:12.380\n I mean, people listen to an episode,\n\n1:06:12.380 --> 1:06:14.140\n perhaps he's a fascinating human being too.\n\n1:06:14.140 --> 1:06:15.820\n I listened to it, it was great.\n\n1:06:15.820 --> 1:06:19.740\n You took tremendous risk as an academic to do what you did.\n\n1:06:19.740 --> 1:06:24.140\n So I do believe that when one takes intelligent risk,\n\n1:06:24.140 --> 1:06:26.300\n because you can die or can crash your career,\n\n1:06:26.300 --> 1:06:28.820\n you can do all sorts of self destructive\n\n1:06:28.820 --> 1:06:31.180\n or destructive things when taking risks.\n\n1:06:31.180 --> 1:06:33.460\n You took risks and they paid off, right?\n\n1:06:33.460 --> 1:06:35.220\n And you take different risks at different stages,\n\n1:06:35.220 --> 1:06:38.940\n but I don't throw around the word admiration lightly.\n\n1:06:38.940 --> 1:06:41.500\n I mean, I admire that you were in this classroom at MIT.\n\n1:06:41.500 --> 1:06:44.460\n You're like, I'm gonna film this and put it online.\n\n1:06:44.460 --> 1:06:47.020\n One of your early interviews is with Ido Portal,\n\n1:06:47.020 --> 1:06:49.140\n who's very hard to get to.\n\n1:06:49.140 --> 1:06:50.820\n I've communicated with Ido a few times.\n\n1:06:50.820 --> 1:06:51.740\n You should definitely talk to him.\n\n1:06:51.740 --> 1:06:53.020\n I can't wait to talk to him.\n\n1:06:53.020 --> 1:06:54.180\n I'm dying to talk to him.\n\n1:06:54.180 --> 1:06:57.460\n I was supposed to do some course teaching with him\n\n1:06:57.460 --> 1:06:58.740\n right before the pandemic hit,\n\n1:06:58.740 --> 1:07:00.700\n and then it got canceled because he couldn't travel,\n\n1:07:00.700 --> 1:07:02.980\n but getting to him is exceedingly challenging.\n\n1:07:02.980 --> 1:07:06.380\n So you do have this incredible ability to get to people\n\n1:07:06.380 --> 1:07:09.900\n and for them to trust you and know you.\n\n1:07:09.900 --> 1:07:12.380\n And I think it's through your authenticity.\n\n1:07:12.380 --> 1:07:15.060\n And I think it's the fact that you're willing to go places\n\n1:07:15.060 --> 1:07:16.780\n where people haven't been before.\n\n1:07:16.780 --> 1:07:19.540\n You know, this is, what's the saying about pioneers?\n\n1:07:19.540 --> 1:07:20.860\n How do you spot the pioneers?\n\n1:07:20.860 --> 1:07:23.060\n They're the people with the arrows in their backs.\n\n1:07:23.060 --> 1:07:26.260\n You know, so that's the, you know, yeah.\n\n1:07:26.260 --> 1:07:28.220\n And that's actually a quote that I lifted\n\n1:07:28.220 --> 1:07:30.820\n from Terry Siknowski, who's a, you know.\n\n1:07:30.820 --> 1:07:34.340\n You should talk to Terry.\n\n1:07:34.340 --> 1:07:37.620\n He's a computational neuroscientist\n\n1:07:37.620 --> 1:07:39.460\n down at the Salk Institute,\n\n1:07:39.460 --> 1:07:40.820\n Howard Hughes investigator, et cetera.\n\n1:07:40.820 --> 1:07:43.420\n But so, you know, taking risks\n\n1:07:43.420 --> 1:07:48.300\n that other people have not taken is, that's a real thing.\n\n1:07:48.300 --> 1:07:53.220\n And to do it with integrity and rigor, that's a real thing.\n\n1:07:53.220 --> 1:07:55.180\n And so, yeah, I'm complimenting you\n\n1:07:55.180 --> 1:07:57.980\n and I hope it lands and lands deeply.\n\n1:07:57.980 --> 1:07:59.460\n But I also hope that people will hear that\n\n1:07:59.460 --> 1:08:01.700\n and understand that it's one thing\n\n1:08:01.700 --> 1:08:06.380\n to do what other people are already doing boldly.\n\n1:08:06.380 --> 1:08:10.540\n It's a whole other thing to launch an entire art form\n\n1:08:10.540 --> 1:08:12.860\n or venue and you did that.\n\n1:08:12.860 --> 1:08:15.580\n And you didn't write a book, hopefully you will someday,\n\n1:08:15.580 --> 1:08:16.540\n but you didn't go write a book.\n\n1:08:16.540 --> 1:08:18.460\n A lot of academics have written books.\n\n1:08:18.460 --> 1:08:19.940\n You went online.\n\n1:08:19.940 --> 1:08:22.020\n Jordan Peterson, another controversial character.\n\n1:08:22.020 --> 1:08:24.420\n He did it too, all those lectures that he filmed.\n\n1:08:24.420 --> 1:08:26.060\n And then it's led to this other thing.\n\n1:08:26.060 --> 1:08:30.180\n So, you know, there's karma.\n\n1:08:30.180 --> 1:08:32.780\n And then there's also having the spine\n\n1:08:32.780 --> 1:08:34.740\n to just put it all on the line\n\n1:08:34.740 --> 1:08:38.860\n and do something for which there is no prior example\n\n1:08:38.860 --> 1:08:43.020\n to hold onto while you go through those headwinds.\n\n1:08:43.020 --> 1:08:44.100\n The really fascinating thing,\n\n1:08:44.100 --> 1:08:46.500\n and actually a lot of people tell me about you,\n\n1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:51.500\n Andrew Huberman, like the reach of a podcast\n\n1:08:51.500 --> 1:08:53.020\n is really fascinating.\n\n1:08:53.020 --> 1:08:56.100\n It's not the numbers of people listen.\n\n1:08:56.100 --> 1:08:59.420\n I don't know if that's important at all.\n\n1:08:59.420 --> 1:09:02.460\n Is what's important is like the depth of connection\n\n1:09:02.460 --> 1:09:04.180\n you have with certain people.\n\n1:09:04.180 --> 1:09:05.420\n It really moves them.\n\n1:09:05.420 --> 1:09:08.540\n Like a great, and like they really get you.\n\n1:09:08.540 --> 1:09:11.220\n So there's a lot of big Andrew Huberman fans\n\n1:09:11.220 --> 1:09:12.620\n that really get you.\n\n1:09:12.620 --> 1:09:13.940\n It's not just the science.\n\n1:09:13.940 --> 1:09:15.860\n It's the stuff between the lines.\n\n1:09:15.860 --> 1:09:16.900\n It's Costello.\n\n1:09:16.900 --> 1:09:18.980\n It's the whole picture of a scientist\n\n1:09:18.980 --> 1:09:22.100\n that finds beauty in biology and reveals it.\n\n1:09:22.100 --> 1:09:23.300\n And they love you for it.\n\n1:09:23.300 --> 1:09:28.220\n You know, because it was on television at the time,\n\n1:09:28.220 --> 1:09:31.660\n I followed that Amanda Knox story pretty carefully.\n\n1:09:31.660 --> 1:09:33.260\n And I don't watch television,\n\n1:09:33.260 --> 1:09:34.740\n but whenever I would travel,\n\n1:09:34.740 --> 1:09:37.140\n if there was a TV on the airplane,\n\n1:09:37.140 --> 1:09:39.380\n I would find myself getting wrapped into things\n\n1:09:39.380 --> 1:09:42.220\n like locked up abroad, you know, like,\n\n1:09:42.220 --> 1:09:44.100\n and these things where they would make you terrified\n\n1:09:44.100 --> 1:09:47.220\n to travel anywhere, let alone commit a crime overseas.\n\n1:09:47.220 --> 1:09:49.540\n You know, the scenes of some of these prisons\n\n1:09:49.540 --> 1:09:50.580\n are so dramatic.\n\n1:09:50.580 --> 1:09:52.500\n And, you know, I mean, her case got a ton of interest.\n\n1:09:52.500 --> 1:09:55.620\n And then I, you know, she went and then was a student\n\n1:09:55.620 --> 1:09:57.220\n at the University of Washington\n\n1:09:57.220 --> 1:09:59.660\n and has talked quite openly about, you know,\n\n1:09:59.660 --> 1:10:02.620\n how she was treated and how people assume guilt\n\n1:10:02.620 --> 1:10:04.140\n and, you know, and eventually, you know,\n\n1:10:04.140 --> 1:10:05.940\n she was exonerated and, you know,\n\n1:10:05.940 --> 1:10:08.460\n we can only go by what we know what the law determined,\n\n1:10:08.460 --> 1:10:10.540\n but, you know, these are people that\n\n1:10:11.420 --> 1:10:13.580\n the world is fascinated by.\n\n1:10:13.580 --> 1:10:15.540\n I would, I'm guessing about a third of people\n\n1:10:15.540 --> 1:10:18.220\n have already decided this person is despicable.\n\n1:10:18.220 --> 1:10:20.540\n Why would you ever give them an audience?\n\n1:10:20.540 --> 1:10:24.140\n About a third of people I think are open to,\n\n1:10:24.140 --> 1:10:27.100\n or at least interested in learning more about them.\n\n1:10:27.100 --> 1:10:29.180\n And then I think the remaining third,\n\n1:10:29.180 --> 1:10:32.820\n kind of the third that the category that I put myself in,\n\n1:10:32.820 --> 1:10:37.820\n which is what can I learn about people and myself,\n\n1:10:37.940 --> 1:10:41.100\n even in my revulsion, right?\n\n1:10:41.100 --> 1:10:42.540\n What can I learn?\n\n1:10:42.540 --> 1:10:44.180\n Yeah, what can I learn about myself\n\n1:10:44.180 --> 1:10:45.700\n from listening to this conversation\n\n1:10:45.700 --> 1:10:48.220\n with somebody that I like to think,\n\n1:10:48.220 --> 1:10:49.300\n I'm not talking about Amanda here,\n\n1:10:49.300 --> 1:10:50.740\n I'm talking about the other people that you're talking about\n\n1:10:50.740 --> 1:10:54.500\n that I don't, I can't relate to, right?\n\n1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:57.300\n Hearing conversations with and about people\n\n1:10:57.300 --> 1:10:59.740\n that you cannot relate to is informative.\n\n1:10:59.740 --> 1:11:03.660\n Otherwise, your whole mind literally becomes insular.\n\n1:11:03.660 --> 1:11:06.260\n Well, there's an interesting thing I also had to,\n\n1:11:07.260 --> 1:11:09.620\n ever since the war in Ukraine broke out,\n\n1:11:09.620 --> 1:11:12.060\n one of the questions I was asking myself,\n\n1:11:13.420 --> 1:11:15.180\n and this is not to be dramatic,\n\n1:11:15.180 --> 1:11:17.740\n it's just a very simple, honest question\n\n1:11:17.740 --> 1:11:19.180\n that I think a lot of journalists\n\n1:11:19.180 --> 1:11:21.060\n that operate in the war zone,\n\n1:11:21.060 --> 1:11:22.780\n or documentary filmmakers\n\n1:11:22.780 --> 1:11:24.740\n that ever since they got a chance to meet,\n\n1:11:24.740 --> 1:11:27.300\n have to be honest with themselves,\n\n1:11:27.300 --> 1:11:32.300\n are you willing to put at risk your life for things you do?\n\n1:11:34.860 --> 1:11:36.020\n What are you willing to die for?\n\n1:11:36.020 --> 1:11:37.460\n Yeah, what are you willing to die for?\n\n1:11:37.460 --> 1:11:42.460\n It sounds very dramatic, but whenever risk goes up,\n\n1:11:44.140 --> 1:11:46.060\n I mean, I don't know, you asked that\n\n1:11:46.060 --> 1:11:48.740\n if you wanna take a trip out to space\n\n1:11:48.740 --> 1:11:51.300\n on a commercial space flight,\n\n1:11:51.300 --> 1:11:56.220\n you have to, are you willing to die for this journey?\n\n1:11:56.220 --> 1:11:58.020\n Now, the odds, they're really small.\n\n1:11:58.020 --> 1:12:00.180\n I just watched Apollo 13 again.\n\n1:12:00.180 --> 1:12:01.300\n Great movie.\n\n1:12:01.300 --> 1:12:02.780\n I'm not going to space.\n\n1:12:02.780 --> 1:12:05.660\n I'm not going to space.\n\n1:12:05.660 --> 1:12:06.580\n Afraid of heights?\n\n1:12:06.580 --> 1:12:08.420\n No, I'm not afraid of heights.\n\n1:12:08.420 --> 1:12:11.660\n I just, it feels like a terrible place to die.\n\n1:12:13.820 --> 1:12:17.020\n Well, first of all, death anywhere is not great.\n\n1:12:17.020 --> 1:12:21.500\n Yeah, although, I have a song teed up in my phone.\n\n1:12:21.500 --> 1:12:24.260\n If the plane starts to go down,\n\n1:12:24.260 --> 1:12:25.540\n I'm gonna spend the last few.\n\n1:12:25.540 --> 1:12:26.420\n It's a rare song.\n\n1:12:26.420 --> 1:12:27.260\n Nobody knows it.\n\n1:12:27.260 --> 1:12:29.780\n It's a song off a B track of my favorite band,\n\n1:12:29.780 --> 1:12:30.620\n which is Rancid.\n\n1:12:30.620 --> 1:12:32.020\n It's a song called The Sentence.\n\n1:12:32.020 --> 1:12:34.060\n And nobody, and I love it.\n\n1:12:34.060 --> 1:12:36.340\n And I listen to it almost every day.\n\n1:12:36.340 --> 1:12:38.180\n Rancid, The Sentence, it's called The Sentence?\n\n1:12:38.180 --> 1:12:41.700\n The band is called Rancid, famous band, relatively.\n\n1:12:41.700 --> 1:12:43.220\n Love those guys, love their music.\n\n1:12:43.220 --> 1:12:44.700\n And the song is The Sentence.\n\n1:12:44.700 --> 1:12:46.900\n You can only find it on like a B side or outtake.\n\n1:12:46.900 --> 1:12:49.860\n And it's, if you don't know how to decipher\n\n1:12:49.860 --> 1:12:50.900\n Tim Armstrong's voice,\n\n1:12:50.900 --> 1:12:52.460\n then you probably won't understand the lyrics.\n\n1:12:52.460 --> 1:12:55.340\n But because it's sung very, very fast.\n\n1:12:55.340 --> 1:12:56.420\n But if the plane ever goes,\n\n1:12:56.420 --> 1:12:57.380\n anytime there's turbulence,\n\n1:12:57.380 --> 1:12:59.020\n I put that thing in, I put the headphones in.\n\n1:12:59.020 --> 1:13:01.060\n I'm like, well, you know, if it's time, it's time.\n\n1:13:01.060 --> 1:13:02.340\n I'm gonna go out like this.\n\n1:13:02.340 --> 1:13:04.180\n I don't wanna drift off into the galaxy,\n\n1:13:04.180 --> 1:13:06.420\n just slowly asphyxiating and freezing to death.\n\n1:13:06.420 --> 1:13:08.060\n That sounds horrible.\n\n1:13:08.060 --> 1:13:09.500\n Just like I wouldn't wanna drown or burn.\n\n1:13:09.500 --> 1:13:10.860\n But on a plane is okay?\n\n1:13:10.860 --> 1:13:11.820\n Well, on a plane, I mean, like,\n\n1:13:11.820 --> 1:13:13.060\n if the thing starts going down\n\n1:13:13.060 --> 1:13:15.100\n and there's truly nothing you can do,\n\n1:13:15.100 --> 1:13:17.180\n you might as well at least listen to your favorite song.\n\n1:13:17.180 --> 1:13:18.140\n Yeah, true, true.\n\n1:13:18.140 --> 1:13:19.220\n I'll probably go with The Pixies,\n\n1:13:19.220 --> 1:13:21.500\n Where's My Mind, like from Fight Club.\n\n1:13:21.500 --> 1:13:23.580\n And just the calmness, just sit back,\n\n1:13:23.580 --> 1:13:26.340\n like the musicians playing at the Titanic.\n\n1:13:26.340 --> 1:13:27.420\n I didn't know you were a Pixies fan.\n\n1:13:27.420 --> 1:13:28.260\n I'm gonna have to.\n\n1:13:28.260 --> 1:13:29.740\n Not so much a Pixies fan.\n\n1:13:29.740 --> 1:13:32.660\n Actually, I should say that I just,\n\n1:13:32.660 --> 1:13:35.980\n that was the, Where's My Mind was the chosen song\n\n1:13:35.980 --> 1:13:39.660\n for Fight Club at the end when the buildings\n\n1:13:39.660 --> 1:13:41.900\n are coming down or something like that.\n\n1:13:41.900 --> 1:13:46.820\n So that there's certain songs that just fit just right\n\n1:13:46.820 --> 1:13:49.140\n for the collapse of human civilization\n\n1:13:49.140 --> 1:13:54.140\n and you're calmly appreciating, like,\n\n1:13:54.220 --> 1:13:55.500\n that that's just it.\n\n1:13:55.500 --> 1:13:58.100\n This is how absurd this life is at any moment it can end.\n\n1:13:58.100 --> 1:13:58.940\n And this is it.\n\n1:14:01.380 --> 1:14:05.460\n I love how we both have death and demise soundtracks.\n\n1:14:05.460 --> 1:14:08.420\n It's just a question when you're an academic,\n\n1:14:08.420 --> 1:14:10.460\n doesn't come up often.\n\n1:14:10.460 --> 1:14:11.300\n Right, well.\n\n1:14:11.300 --> 1:14:15.940\n Yeah, there are some academics that are bold and brave.\n\n1:14:15.940 --> 1:14:17.980\n It's not a phenotype.\n\n1:14:17.980 --> 1:14:19.700\n Being bold and brave in the physical world\n\n1:14:19.700 --> 1:14:22.100\n is not a common phenotype of academics.\n\n1:14:22.100 --> 1:14:24.260\n I mean, the great neurologist, one of my,\n\n1:14:24.260 --> 1:14:27.780\n I don't have many heroes, but Oliver Sacks is a true hero.\n\n1:14:27.780 --> 1:14:30.340\n I mean, people think of him as a writer,\n\n1:14:30.340 --> 1:14:32.140\n but he was foremost a neurologist\n\n1:14:32.140 --> 1:14:36.660\n and he took tremendous pushback from the neurology community\n\n1:14:36.660 --> 1:14:39.020\n for doing his books and his articles.\n\n1:14:39.020 --> 1:14:40.940\n He has a great biography called On the Move.\n\n1:14:40.940 --> 1:14:42.100\n There's a wonderful documentary\n\n1:14:42.100 --> 1:14:42.980\n that just came out about him.\n\n1:14:42.980 --> 1:14:44.660\n He died in 2015.\n\n1:14:44.660 --> 1:14:49.220\n I'm actually kind of a collector of his things,\n\n1:14:50.100 --> 1:14:53.900\n but he, tremendous, but he was accused of horrible things\n\n1:14:53.900 --> 1:14:56.260\n until the movie Awakenings came out\n\n1:14:56.260 --> 1:14:58.020\n with De Niro and Robin Williams.\n\n1:14:58.020 --> 1:15:00.100\n Amazing movie, by the way, people don't,\n\n1:15:00.100 --> 1:15:02.260\n they seem to not say great things about the movie.\n\n1:15:02.260 --> 1:15:03.100\n I love that movie.\n\n1:15:03.100 --> 1:15:04.140\n It was amazing.\n\n1:15:04.140 --> 1:15:08.460\n And it was only once he became famous from that movie\n\n1:15:08.460 --> 1:15:11.260\n that his more academic work started\n\n1:15:11.260 --> 1:15:12.940\n to receive any kind of attention\n\n1:15:12.940 --> 1:15:15.380\n and he was invited back to Columbia and NYU.\n\n1:15:15.380 --> 1:15:18.140\n You know, the New York Neuroscience Mafia is a real thing.\n\n1:15:18.140 --> 1:15:20.140\n And yes, you know who you are.\n\n1:15:20.140 --> 1:15:22.580\n And some of them are actually coming on the broadcast.\n\n1:15:22.580 --> 1:15:25.340\n They are...\n\n1:15:25.340 --> 1:15:26.900\n I think we talked offline about this.\n\n1:15:26.900 --> 1:15:30.060\n We should start a mafia to fight off\n\n1:15:30.060 --> 1:15:31.620\n whatever's going on in the East Coast.\n\n1:15:31.620 --> 1:15:33.980\n Although I'm still at MIT, so I don't know how that works,\n\n1:15:33.980 --> 1:15:36.020\n but Boston is different than New York.\n\n1:15:36.020 --> 1:15:37.420\n Yeah, so I have tremendous respect\n\n1:15:37.420 --> 1:15:38.780\n for science done in New York.\n\n1:15:38.780 --> 1:15:39.620\n Don't get me wrong.\n\n1:15:39.620 --> 1:15:41.220\n They are excellent scientists.\n\n1:15:41.220 --> 1:15:44.500\n It's just a very different culture than on the West Coast.\n\n1:15:44.500 --> 1:15:46.780\n And the personalities, the personalities...\n\n1:15:46.780 --> 1:15:48.900\n Tremendous respect for the mob.\n\n1:15:48.900 --> 1:15:53.700\n Well, and the personalities are a bit more grandiose.\n\n1:15:53.700 --> 1:15:56.260\n However, because of some of the shift\n\n1:15:56.260 --> 1:15:59.300\n in science culture in the last few years,\n\n1:15:59.300 --> 1:16:03.580\n things around scandals and things of that sort,\n\n1:16:03.580 --> 1:16:07.180\n they've been forced to tamp down some of their personality\n\n1:16:07.180 --> 1:16:09.380\n or at least their outspoken personality.\n\n1:16:09.380 --> 1:16:11.140\n And I actually think it's revealed something\n\n1:16:11.140 --> 1:16:12.740\n really important and useful in science,\n\n1:16:12.740 --> 1:16:15.180\n which is it used to be the case\n\n1:16:15.180 --> 1:16:18.420\n you could really inject your personality into what you do.\n\n1:16:19.540 --> 1:16:21.900\n Richard Feynman is a good example.\n\n1:16:21.900 --> 1:16:25.060\n If he did today what he did then,\n\n1:16:25.060 --> 1:16:28.660\n bongo drumming on the roof of Caltech naked,\n\n1:16:28.660 --> 1:16:31.620\n working out theorems in strip clubs and things of that,\n\n1:16:31.620 --> 1:16:35.500\n he would have lost his job in moments.\n\n1:16:35.500 --> 1:16:37.740\n So that kind of behavior isn't celebrated anymore.\n\n1:16:37.740 --> 1:16:39.460\n It's actually punished.\n\n1:16:39.460 --> 1:16:40.540\n And I'm only half kidding\n\n1:16:40.540 --> 1:16:42.260\n about this New York neuroscience mafia,\n\n1:16:42.260 --> 1:16:44.140\n but because I now exist in multiple realms,\n\n1:16:44.140 --> 1:16:45.220\n I can say these sorts of things.\n\n1:16:45.220 --> 1:16:47.340\n And I, again, admiration and respect,\n\n1:16:47.340 --> 1:16:50.460\n but I will say that I think it's important\n\n1:16:50.460 --> 1:16:53.380\n that people in science and kids that are curious\n\n1:16:53.380 --> 1:16:58.060\n about science understand that you can have any personality\n\n1:16:58.060 --> 1:17:01.220\n provided that you're ethical and respectful in science\n\n1:17:01.220 --> 1:17:03.020\n and do well, right?\n\n1:17:03.020 --> 1:17:05.500\n There are true bench scientists\n\n1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:07.060\n that just want to be at the bench.\n\n1:17:07.060 --> 1:17:08.580\n There are people that just want to be in their office.\n\n1:17:08.580 --> 1:17:11.580\n There are people that really enjoy public speaking.\n\n1:17:11.580 --> 1:17:12.980\n And there are people that love meetings\n\n1:17:12.980 --> 1:17:14.220\n and there are people that hate crowds.\n\n1:17:14.220 --> 1:17:16.140\n And so there's a place for everybody,\n\n1:17:16.140 --> 1:17:19.020\n truly a place for everybody in science.\n\n1:17:19.020 --> 1:17:21.300\n I would like to be able to shine light\n\n1:17:21.300 --> 1:17:23.180\n on the fact that there are,\n\n1:17:23.180 --> 1:17:27.580\n you can have a shy personality, an outgoing personality,\n\n1:17:27.580 --> 1:17:30.740\n and you can, all of those can be,\n\n1:17:30.740 --> 1:17:32.420\n have excellent careers in science,\n\n1:17:32.420 --> 1:17:34.140\n but you have to find the community in place\n\n1:17:34.140 --> 1:17:34.980\n that's right for you.\n\n1:17:34.980 --> 1:17:36.580\n One reason I like Stanford\n\n1:17:36.580 --> 1:17:39.620\n is that Stanford is very much about the future.\n\n1:17:39.620 --> 1:17:40.980\n We have Nobel prize winners,\n\n1:17:40.980 --> 1:17:43.020\n we have field medal winners and all that stuff,\n\n1:17:43.020 --> 1:17:44.260\n and their names are on walls\n\n1:17:44.260 --> 1:17:46.100\n and we acknowledge their great works.\n\n1:17:46.100 --> 1:17:49.060\n But most of what you hear about in the halls of Stanford\n\n1:17:49.060 --> 1:17:52.420\n is about what's happening now and what could happen next.\n\n1:17:52.420 --> 1:17:53.980\n It's really about the future.\n\n1:17:53.980 --> 1:17:55.940\n Whereas when I've spent time at other institutions\n\n1:17:55.940 --> 1:17:58.340\n not to be named, you hear that,\n\n1:17:58.340 --> 1:18:02.060\n but there's a lot of kind of recycling and regurgitation\n\n1:18:02.060 --> 1:18:03.620\n of how wonderful people are\n\n1:18:03.620 --> 1:18:05.820\n based on things they did previously.\n\n1:18:05.820 --> 1:18:09.260\n And the students at Stanford, because of Silicon Valley,\n\n1:18:09.260 --> 1:18:10.980\n sure, they have respect for Nobel prizes,\n\n1:18:10.980 --> 1:18:12.140\n they're delighted to be learning from\n\n1:18:12.140 --> 1:18:14.140\n and surrounded by all these great minds,\n\n1:18:14.140 --> 1:18:15.460\n but they're mostly interested\n\n1:18:15.460 --> 1:18:17.660\n in what they are gonna create.\n\n1:18:17.660 --> 1:18:19.980\n And so I kind of, not kind of,\n\n1:18:19.980 --> 1:18:23.260\n I really like the shift toward possibility\n\n1:18:23.260 --> 1:18:26.420\n as opposed to things that are steeped in tradition.\n\n1:18:26.420 --> 1:18:28.660\n You know, I've never been to high table dinner at Oxford,\n\n1:18:28.660 --> 1:18:30.540\n I'm sure it's a wonderful experience.\n\n1:18:30.540 --> 1:18:35.140\n I'm also not sure what purpose it serves for the world,\n\n1:18:35.140 --> 1:18:36.260\n but I've never been,\n\n1:18:36.260 --> 1:18:37.740\n and so I don't know what the conversations are,\n\n1:18:37.740 --> 1:18:40.860\n and so maybe I'm, you know, speaking out of line here.\n\n1:18:40.860 --> 1:18:43.060\n And then now I'm definitely not getting invited.\n\n1:18:43.060 --> 1:18:44.860\n No, you're definitely getting invited.\n\n1:18:44.860 --> 1:18:45.740\n But yeah, I'm with you,\n\n1:18:45.740 --> 1:18:48.180\n the culture's picked the right ones for you.\n\n1:18:48.180 --> 1:18:50.900\n That's why I like MIT, the spirit of it.\n\n1:18:51.980 --> 1:18:55.140\n To me, it's not about the past or the future,\n\n1:18:55.140 --> 1:18:58.180\n it's about just tinkering and having fun,\n\n1:18:58.180 --> 1:18:59.500\n building cool stuff.\n\n1:18:59.500 --> 1:19:03.500\n Like the big ambitious projects, it's there.\n\n1:19:03.500 --> 1:19:06.620\n I mean, it may be more in the biology and the health side,\n\n1:19:06.620 --> 1:19:08.740\n but like the engineering side,\n\n1:19:08.740 --> 1:19:10.780\n it doesn't matter if this has any impact,\n\n1:19:10.780 --> 1:19:13.780\n let us build the coolest thing the world has ever built.\n\n1:19:13.780 --> 1:19:16.580\n Well, whenever I'm in Kendall Square,\n\n1:19:16.580 --> 1:19:18.780\n I've seen, they have those buildings there\n\n1:19:18.780 --> 1:19:20.380\n that actually tilt toward the ground.\n\n1:19:20.380 --> 1:19:22.460\n These are these, the architecture of MIT\n\n1:19:22.460 --> 1:19:24.060\n is also really impressive.\n\n1:19:24.060 --> 1:19:25.500\n Yeah, this, he pulled up,\n\n1:19:25.500 --> 1:19:27.380\n Sergei just pulled up Yilmaz tweet.\n\n1:19:27.380 --> 1:19:28.820\n I'm inspired by curiosity.\n\n1:19:28.820 --> 1:19:30.180\n That is what drives me.\n\n1:19:30.180 --> 1:19:32.980\n So let us expand the scope and scale of consciousness\n\n1:19:32.980 --> 1:19:35.700\n so that we may aspire to understand the universe.\n\n1:19:35.700 --> 1:19:37.220\n Those are like three tweets in one,\n\n1:19:37.220 --> 1:19:41.700\n but curiosity, yeah, yeah, curiosity for its own sake.\n\n1:19:41.700 --> 1:19:42.740\n What's that saying?\n\n1:19:43.620 --> 1:19:45.340\n I think Dorothy Parker said,\n\n1:19:46.260 --> 1:19:48.580\n the cure for boredom is curiosity.\n\n1:19:48.580 --> 1:19:50.460\n There is no cure for curiosity.\n\n1:19:51.460 --> 1:19:52.580\n And you need to celebrate.\n\n1:19:52.580 --> 1:19:54.900\n So let me just briefly mention\n\n1:19:54.900 --> 1:19:59.900\n to my lovely friends at MIT\n\n1:20:00.580 --> 1:20:03.220\n to celebrate different weirdness,\n\n1:20:03.220 --> 1:20:06.020\n to celebrate the weird characters.\n\n1:20:06.020 --> 1:20:10.780\n I've, I sometimes get loving pressure\n\n1:20:10.780 --> 1:20:15.020\n from my lovely friends at MIT\n\n1:20:15.020 --> 1:20:18.580\n to tone down the weirdness a bit.\n\n1:20:18.580 --> 1:20:19.420\n Really?\n\n1:20:19.420 --> 1:20:20.460\n Even from MIT?\n\n1:20:20.460 --> 1:20:24.980\n I'm very fortunate to have a lot of leverage\n\n1:20:24.980 --> 1:20:29.140\n to where I have completely resist the pressure,\n\n1:20:29.140 --> 1:20:32.500\n but I'm very sure that there's young faculty\n\n1:20:32.500 --> 1:20:35.980\n that with that subtle pressure would...\n\n1:20:37.340 --> 1:20:39.860\n Dissolve them into a puddle of tears.\n\n1:20:39.860 --> 1:20:40.700\n Not, no, no.\n\n1:20:40.700 --> 1:20:41.860\n Oh, they're from Boston, excuse me.\n\n1:20:41.860 --> 1:20:42.900\n From Boston, that's right.\n\n1:20:42.900 --> 1:20:43.740\n They're tougher than that.\n\n1:20:43.740 --> 1:20:45.820\n That's right, but it's a slight nudging\n\n1:20:45.820 --> 1:20:50.820\n towards conformity that I think ultimately destroys,\n\n1:20:51.340 --> 1:20:56.340\n or at least lessens the power of the kind of science\n\n1:20:56.660 --> 1:21:00.220\n that you can do when you encourage diversity.\n\n1:21:00.220 --> 1:21:02.420\n Diversity in all of its forms,\n\n1:21:02.420 --> 1:21:04.220\n including the weirdness of ideas,\n\n1:21:04.220 --> 1:21:05.820\n the out of the box thinkers,\n\n1:21:05.820 --> 1:21:08.880\n including the flamboyant behavior online,\n\n1:21:10.260 --> 1:21:13.860\n how you choose to educate, how you choose to inspire.\n\n1:21:13.860 --> 1:21:15.260\n People talk about freedom of speech,\n\n1:21:15.260 --> 1:21:17.820\n but it's not just freedom of speech\n\n1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:20.320\n to say controversial things.\n\n1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:23.140\n It's also freedom of speech to be weird.\n\n1:21:23.140 --> 1:21:26.060\n If you're, for some reason, fascinated in...\n\n1:21:27.060 --> 1:21:28.100\n You look at Elon Musk.\n\n1:21:28.100 --> 1:21:29.660\n He talks about sex a lot.\n\n1:21:29.660 --> 1:21:31.740\n Let the guy put sex memes up.\n\n1:21:31.740 --> 1:21:33.060\n Who cares?\n\n1:21:33.060 --> 1:21:36.400\n I mean, I feel like Elon can do basically whatever he wants.\n\n1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:37.640\n Right, there's no pressure,\n\n1:21:37.640 --> 1:21:40.380\n but there's a bunch of Elons in the academic world.\n\n1:21:40.380 --> 1:21:42.440\n There's a bunch of Elons.\n\n1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:43.480\n No, actually, sorry.\n\n1:21:43.480 --> 1:21:47.100\n Let me backtrack, because the man deserves props.\n\n1:21:47.100 --> 1:21:48.780\n Right, he's unparalleled.\n\n1:21:48.780 --> 1:21:50.480\n He's a CEO of major companies.\n\n1:21:50.480 --> 1:21:53.260\n You better believe there's pressure\n\n1:21:53.260 --> 1:21:55.000\n to behave more like a CEO,\n\n1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:57.660\n as opposed to a giggling schoolboy\n\n1:21:57.660 --> 1:22:00.140\n who's posting memes throughout the night.\n\n1:22:00.140 --> 1:22:02.060\n But that is him.\n\n1:22:02.060 --> 1:22:06.060\n And that freedom, that's what freedom looks like.\n\n1:22:06.060 --> 1:22:08.100\n I talk to a lot of CEOs,\n\n1:22:08.100 --> 1:22:13.100\n and a lot of them feel like caged birds\n\n1:22:13.940 --> 1:22:17.740\n who have long ago forgotten how to sing, quite honestly.\n\n1:22:17.740 --> 1:22:20.740\n Like, there's like shareholders,\n\n1:22:20.740 --> 1:22:22.660\n and they come up with excuses for themselves.\n\n1:22:22.660 --> 1:22:25.660\n Here's why I have to be this way, you have to understand.\n\n1:22:25.660 --> 1:22:27.820\n So on, there's PR, there's marketing people,\n\n1:22:27.820 --> 1:22:30.300\n there's lawyers, there's all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:22:30.300 --> 1:22:35.080\n But the final result is the authenticity is suffocated.\n\n1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:38.460\n The beautiful weirdness of a CEO,\n\n1:22:38.460 --> 1:22:41.660\n of a leader, of a creator, of a scientist, all that,\n\n1:22:41.660 --> 1:22:45.060\n that's all gone.\n\n1:22:45.060 --> 1:22:49.100\n Well, Steve Jobs wouldn't have kept his job\n\n1:22:49.100 --> 1:22:52.100\n in acting the way he did in his 20s and 30s\n\n1:22:52.100 --> 1:22:53.540\n in today's climate.\n\n1:22:53.540 --> 1:22:57.200\n But he probably would have updated his protocols,\n\n1:22:57.200 --> 1:22:58.040\n so to speak. A little bit,\n\n1:22:58.040 --> 1:22:59.740\n but maybe.\n\n1:22:59.740 --> 1:23:01.100\n You know, you're screaming at employees.\n\n1:23:01.100 --> 1:23:02.940\n I mean, these are anecdotes, right?\n\n1:23:02.940 --> 1:23:04.440\n I call them anecdata,\n\n1:23:04.440 --> 1:23:05.780\n because people treat them as data,\n\n1:23:05.780 --> 1:23:07.160\n but they're really just anecdotes.\n\n1:23:07.160 --> 1:23:08.660\n We don't know, I wasn't there.\n\n1:23:09.700 --> 1:23:14.300\n But, you know, I like the idea of authenticity\n\n1:23:14.300 --> 1:23:16.500\n without oversharing, right?\n\n1:23:16.500 --> 1:23:19.620\n You're very authentic, but there are aspects to your life\n\n1:23:19.620 --> 1:23:22.340\n that I'm aware of that your audiences will never be aware of,\n\n1:23:22.340 --> 1:23:23.280\n and there are aspects of your life\n\n1:23:23.280 --> 1:23:24.380\n that I'll never be aware of.\n\n1:23:24.380 --> 1:23:26.540\n And so you're still authentic, but.\n\n1:23:26.540 --> 1:23:29.500\n Yeah, wait, which ones are you aware of?\n\n1:23:29.500 --> 1:23:30.620\n People are gonna wonder, like,\n\n1:23:30.620 --> 1:23:32.860\n what is, is he up in sex dungeon?\n\n1:23:32.860 --> 1:23:33.700\n What is this?\n\n1:23:33.700 --> 1:23:35.380\n No, no, no, no.\n\n1:23:35.380 --> 1:23:37.720\n But interesting choice of examples.\n\n1:23:39.300 --> 1:23:42.220\n No, but I think that, you know,\n\n1:23:42.220 --> 1:23:44.940\n people lose the careers on the basis\n\n1:23:44.940 --> 1:23:47.460\n of the movement of their thumbs, right?\n\n1:23:47.460 --> 1:23:50.360\n I mean, the chair of psychiatry at Columbia\n\n1:23:50.360 --> 1:23:55.360\n recently lost his position based on a response to a tweet.\n\n1:23:55.380 --> 1:23:56.220\n People can look that up.\n\n1:23:56.220 --> 1:23:58.260\n This is one of the most famous psychiatry departments\n\n1:23:58.260 --> 1:23:59.240\n in the world.\n\n1:23:59.240 --> 1:24:01.000\n And he put something out there\n\n1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:03.060\n that was very insensitive, frankly.\n\n1:24:03.060 --> 1:24:06.300\n And everyone that I talked to about it was like,\n\n1:24:06.300 --> 1:24:09.060\n gosh, that was very, very insensitive,\n\n1:24:09.060 --> 1:24:10.080\n not thoughtful at all.\n\n1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:11.940\n And he lost his job, right?\n\n1:24:11.940 --> 1:24:12.960\n Or at least had to step down.\n\n1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:14.260\n I don't know the specifics.\n\n1:24:14.260 --> 1:24:18.680\n So, you know, I think I read someplace\n\n1:24:18.680 --> 1:24:22.700\n that more than half of the job loss due to online behavior\n\n1:24:22.700 --> 1:24:25.940\n is because people were trying to be funny, right?\n\n1:24:25.940 --> 1:24:29.760\n I mean, not everyone can pull off what Tim Dillon.\n\n1:24:29.760 --> 1:24:30.980\n Oh, and by the way, congratulations.\n\n1:24:30.980 --> 1:24:32.500\n I heard that you and Tim just got married.\n\n1:24:32.500 --> 1:24:33.340\n Yeah, I saw that too.\n\n1:24:33.340 --> 1:24:34.180\n No, no, we didn't just get married.\n\n1:24:34.180 --> 1:24:35.000\n Engaged.\n\n1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:35.840\n He proposed.\n\n1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:36.680\n Yeah, got it, got it, got it.\n\n1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:37.580\n And I said, yes.\n\n1:24:37.580 --> 1:24:38.420\n Right.\n\n1:24:38.420 --> 1:24:40.380\n So some people can get away.\n\n1:24:40.380 --> 1:24:41.220\n Oh, yeah.\n\n1:24:41.220 --> 1:24:42.040\n Thank you.\n\n1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:42.880\n Thank you, Sergey.\n\n1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:43.720\n Has that ready to go.\n\n1:24:43.720 --> 1:24:46.140\n See those 13.3 thousand likes?\n\n1:24:46.140 --> 1:24:48.140\n One of those is mine.\n\n1:24:48.140 --> 1:24:49.760\n So for people who are not aware,\n\n1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:52.980\n one of the days in April tweeted that Tim Dillon\n\n1:24:52.980 --> 1:24:55.180\n asked me to get married and I said, yes.\n\n1:24:55.180 --> 1:24:59.380\n I think Tim said, the wedding will be on 6th Street\n\n1:24:59.380 --> 1:25:01.280\n in Austin, bring all of your weapons,\n\n1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:03.320\n which of course is totally inappropriate.\n\n1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:08.320\n This is, I was like PG funny,\n\n1:25:08.900 --> 1:25:12.620\n and he's goes rated R funny right away.\n\n1:25:12.620 --> 1:25:16.260\n But that said, I mean, if there's anyone\n\n1:25:17.180 --> 1:25:19.380\n I would like to get married with,\n\n1:25:19.380 --> 1:25:21.340\n it's that guy and we would do it in Austin\n\n1:25:21.340 --> 1:25:24.460\n and it would be epic.\n\n1:25:24.460 --> 1:25:31.460\n It would be like the wedding from November rain, one of the,\n\n1:25:31.500 --> 1:25:32.540\n Mr. and Mrs.\n\n1:25:32.540 --> 1:25:33.380\n Oh, wow.\n\n1:25:33.380 --> 1:25:34.340\n Oh, Mr. and Mr., I apologize.\n\n1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:38.820\n Wow, yeah, and you broke tradition with the jacket color.\n\n1:25:38.820 --> 1:25:42.780\n So it sounds to me that you are a free speech absolutist.\n\n1:25:42.780 --> 1:25:44.540\n I think freedom is really important\n\n1:25:44.540 --> 1:25:48.460\n and that includes letting people who are hateful,\n\n1:25:48.460 --> 1:25:51.220\n letting people who are controversial\n\n1:25:51.220 --> 1:25:53.140\n have a voice on platforms.\n\n1:25:53.140 --> 1:25:57.140\n But it becomes, I'm not sure what exactly to think\n\n1:25:57.140 --> 1:26:02.140\n because I also treasure the quiet voices\n\n1:26:03.380 --> 1:26:04.600\n in the back of the room.\n\n1:26:05.540 --> 1:26:10.540\n And sometimes the assholes silence those voices,\n\n1:26:10.620 --> 1:26:14.300\n meaning by being loud and obnoxious and so on,\n\n1:26:14.300 --> 1:26:16.460\n it pushes away the thoughtful people.\n\n1:26:16.460 --> 1:26:19.340\n So I'm also a fan of creating communities.\n\n1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:23.980\n Like you should be able to let people kind of\n\n1:26:23.980 --> 1:26:27.580\n build a community that's positive, that's loving,\n\n1:26:27.580 --> 1:26:32.580\n or that's constantly trolling, or that's super hateful.\n\n1:26:33.940 --> 1:26:37.100\n All those communities should have a place in the world.\n\n1:26:37.100 --> 1:26:40.540\n But like the thing I've noticed is that\n\n1:26:41.980 --> 1:26:44.860\n hate can destroy, a community full of hate\n\n1:26:44.860 --> 1:26:46.820\n can destroy a community full of love\n\n1:26:46.820 --> 1:26:49.540\n easier than a community full of love\n\n1:26:49.540 --> 1:26:51.020\n can overtake one with hate.\n\n1:26:51.020 --> 1:26:54.020\n And so you have to kind of, I don't know exactly how,\n\n1:26:54.020 --> 1:26:58.760\n but create digital mechanisms that discourage\n\n1:26:58.760 --> 1:27:00.340\n the collision of these communities.\n\n1:27:00.340 --> 1:27:03.900\n They should all have a platform and ability to speak\n\n1:27:03.900 --> 1:27:06.880\n to a large audience, but you have to be careful\n\n1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:11.540\n to protect that like little flame of connection\n\n1:27:11.540 --> 1:27:12.380\n that people have.\n\n1:27:12.380 --> 1:27:17.140\n Yeah, that's good, the goodness, it sounds like, I mean,\n\n1:27:17.140 --> 1:27:20.220\n yeah, I think in any great city like New York,\n\n1:27:20.220 --> 1:27:24.020\n which I love, by the way, you wanna have a symphony\n\n1:27:24.020 --> 1:27:26.100\n in an opera house and you want some punk rock shows\n\n1:27:26.100 --> 1:27:29.540\n happening on the Lower East Side, you want all of that.\n\n1:27:29.540 --> 1:27:32.180\n You just don't necessarily want them to overlap.\n\n1:27:32.180 --> 1:27:36.060\n In terms of social media and then podcasts and engagement,\n\n1:27:36.060 --> 1:27:38.600\n one thing that I decided very early on\n\n1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:41.260\n is was to encourage comments and feedback, et cetera.\n\n1:27:41.260 --> 1:27:44.980\n But I have in my mind what I call classroom rules.\n\n1:27:44.980 --> 1:27:46.180\n You've taught in the university\n\n1:27:46.180 --> 1:27:48.040\n and then you teach in the university\n\n1:27:48.040 --> 1:27:51.580\n and you establish a certain etiquette within the classroom\n\n1:27:51.580 --> 1:27:54.140\n of the kinds of questions that you'll tolerate, right?\n\n1:27:54.140 --> 1:27:56.300\n So there's always the student that's gonna ask a question,\n\n1:27:56.300 --> 1:27:58.340\n which is basically a 10 minute monologue\n\n1:27:58.340 --> 1:28:00.100\n about their experience that really isn't a question\n\n1:28:00.100 --> 1:28:01.540\n that pertains to a lot of people.\n\n1:28:01.540 --> 1:28:04.580\n So you politely discourage that kind of question\n\n1:28:04.580 --> 1:28:05.820\n and you encourage the kinds of questions\n\n1:28:05.820 --> 1:28:08.180\n that are likely to be in the minds of many other students.\n\n1:28:08.180 --> 1:28:09.500\n It's just more efficient that way.\n\n1:28:09.500 --> 1:28:12.740\n Or not politely, which is more, you know,\n\n1:28:12.740 --> 1:28:15.160\n I try and respond to comments and I try and respond,\n\n1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:16.460\n but also, you know, there's this,\n\n1:28:16.460 --> 1:28:17.820\n also this really interesting question.\n\n1:28:17.820 --> 1:28:20.620\n Now, if you block people or restrict people,\n\n1:28:20.620 --> 1:28:22.080\n people think that you're somehow afraid\n\n1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:23.780\n of the information that they're posting,\n\n1:28:23.780 --> 1:28:25.580\n but that's often not the case.\n\n1:28:25.580 --> 1:28:26.740\n I'm not in the habit of blocking\n\n1:28:26.740 --> 1:28:27.820\n or restricting too many people.\n\n1:28:27.820 --> 1:28:29.380\n Occasionally we've had to do it\n\n1:28:29.380 --> 1:28:31.420\n only because of how other people are being treated\n\n1:28:31.420 --> 1:28:32.900\n in the comment section.\n\n1:28:32.900 --> 1:28:35.300\n What I can take and what I think other people deserve to take\n\n1:28:35.300 --> 1:28:37.100\n are two completely different things.\n\n1:28:37.100 --> 1:28:40.020\n David Goggins, right, who we both know well,\n\n1:28:40.020 --> 1:28:40.920\n I don't know if he still does this,\n\n1:28:40.920 --> 1:28:42.940\n but a few years ago, he posted something like,\n\n1:28:42.940 --> 1:28:45.900\n if people ask him, when do you sleep?\n\n1:28:45.900 --> 1:28:47.220\n He would just block them.\n\n1:28:48.060 --> 1:28:49.920\n Because it wasn't consistent with what he was trying to say.\n\n1:28:49.920 --> 1:28:51.640\n Of course he sleeps, but it's, you know,\n\n1:28:51.640 --> 1:28:53.300\n he's trying to get a particular message out.\n\n1:28:53.300 --> 1:28:54.600\n I think people should just understand\n\n1:28:54.600 --> 1:28:59.500\n that everybody's page is their own to moderate, right?\n\n1:28:59.500 --> 1:29:02.020\n Just like in a classroom, there are certain rules,\n\n1:29:02.020 --> 1:29:03.280\n of course, of institution,\n\n1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:05.140\n but then you establish the etiquette\n\n1:29:05.140 --> 1:29:06.660\n within the context of the kind of class.\n\n1:29:06.660 --> 1:29:09.160\n You know, a class about personality psychology\n\n1:29:09.160 --> 1:29:11.380\n or the psychology of love,\n\n1:29:11.380 --> 1:29:14.920\n you're gonna have a very different range of conversations\n\n1:29:14.920 --> 1:29:17.860\n than, you know, a class on, you know,\n\n1:29:17.860 --> 1:29:19.200\n memory and physiology.\n\n1:29:20.140 --> 1:29:25.140\n So I think social media is a great place for conversation,\n\n1:29:25.320 --> 1:29:26.880\n but it's not necessarily a great place\n\n1:29:26.880 --> 1:29:28.460\n for every kind of conversation.\n\n1:29:28.460 --> 1:29:31.540\n Yeah, and I also just say that people that do get blocked,\n\n1:29:31.540 --> 1:29:35.260\n I never, this is something I do very deliberately,\n\n1:29:35.260 --> 1:29:37.180\n blocked or ignored.\n\n1:29:37.180 --> 1:29:38.980\n I never think poorly of them.\n\n1:29:38.980 --> 1:29:41.980\n I actually explicitly think,\n\n1:29:41.980 --> 1:29:44.120\n if there's somebody that's like saying\n\n1:29:44.120 --> 1:29:45.780\n hateful things about me or whatever,\n\n1:29:45.780 --> 1:29:47.540\n I always think positive thoughts.\n\n1:29:47.540 --> 1:29:49.680\n It's not some kind of weird guru thing,\n\n1:29:49.680 --> 1:29:52.140\n but just actually found that as a hack.\n\n1:29:52.140 --> 1:29:53.720\n I think well of them,\n\n1:29:53.720 --> 1:29:56.700\n and that allows me to never think of them again.\n\n1:29:56.700 --> 1:29:58.220\n Like I send them my love,\n\n1:29:58.220 --> 1:30:01.200\n and like I think this is a like fascinating human being\n\n1:30:01.200 --> 1:30:02.820\n with a fascinating story.\n\n1:30:02.820 --> 1:30:04.620\n I would love to have time to actually learn\n\n1:30:04.620 --> 1:30:07.140\n about their story, but there's not enough time in the world.\n\n1:30:07.140 --> 1:30:09.660\n And I just think well of them and then I move on\n\n1:30:09.660 --> 1:30:13.460\n and enjoy a delicious meal with people that are close to me\n\n1:30:13.460 --> 1:30:16.660\n and I love and so on and just, and move on.\n\n1:30:16.660 --> 1:30:19.340\n And then never adding to the negativity of like,\n\n1:30:19.340 --> 1:30:21.520\n just even in the privacy of my own mind,\n\n1:30:21.520 --> 1:30:23.700\n thinking a hateful thought towards them,\n\n1:30:23.700 --> 1:30:25.500\n it serves no purpose whatsoever.\n\n1:30:25.500 --> 1:30:27.080\n Yeah, I love that about you.\n\n1:30:27.080 --> 1:30:29.540\n And I know that what you just said to be true,\n\n1:30:29.540 --> 1:30:33.940\n one of the, I think more toxic things in life\n\n1:30:33.940 --> 1:30:37.780\n is what's called, you know, a vacuative projection.\n\n1:30:37.780 --> 1:30:40.260\n When people feel something and they try and evacuate it\n\n1:30:40.260 --> 1:30:41.500\n and project it onto somebody else.\n\n1:30:41.500 --> 1:30:43.220\n Projection is fascinating, right?\n\n1:30:43.220 --> 1:30:44.620\n What you essentially just said is that\n\n1:30:44.620 --> 1:30:46.700\n you don't accept projections.\n\n1:30:46.700 --> 1:30:49.020\n And in fact, you transmute them\n\n1:30:49.020 --> 1:30:51.320\n to put it in the language of the Buddhist, you know,\n\n1:30:51.320 --> 1:30:53.300\n you transmute it into positivity.\n\n1:30:53.300 --> 1:30:58.300\n And in that way, you truly neutralize it and transmute it.\n\n1:30:58.540 --> 1:31:02.900\n I think that if people were better understood\n\n1:31:02.900 --> 1:31:04.340\n when they were experiencing\n\n1:31:04.340 --> 1:31:06.500\n or observing a vacuative projection,\n\n1:31:08.400 --> 1:31:11.580\n the world would be a much healthier and happier place.\n\n1:31:11.580 --> 1:31:14.780\n But it requires a certain stable internal rudder.\n\n1:31:14.780 --> 1:31:18.300\n And, you know, when we're tired or sick or angry,\n\n1:31:18.300 --> 1:31:21.460\n you know, we're hungry, excessively hungry.\n\n1:31:21.460 --> 1:31:23.460\n All of us are less good at it.\n\n1:31:23.460 --> 1:31:25.580\n I've been positively struck by the nature\n\n1:31:25.580 --> 1:31:28.580\n of most of the interactions, not just feedback,\n\n1:31:28.580 --> 1:31:32.340\n but my favorite thing as an educator in the classroom,\n\n1:31:32.340 --> 1:31:33.440\n but also on social media.\n\n1:31:33.440 --> 1:31:36.340\n My absolute favorite thing is when the comments\n\n1:31:36.340 --> 1:31:39.660\n about other people's comments are positively reinforcing.\n\n1:31:39.660 --> 1:31:42.940\n So you see people having conversations within the comments\n\n1:31:42.940 --> 1:31:45.060\n and you realize this is like, if you, as an educator,\n\n1:31:45.060 --> 1:31:47.020\n again, you know, it's fun to teach\n\n1:31:47.020 --> 1:31:48.520\n and it's fun to talk to the students,\n\n1:31:48.520 --> 1:31:51.740\n but the real pleasure is in walking by a small group\n\n1:31:51.740 --> 1:31:54.220\n of students on campus and hearing them talking\n\n1:31:54.220 --> 1:31:58.380\n about the material, that just fills me with joy.\n\n1:31:58.380 --> 1:32:02.700\n And because what it means is that the ideas are reverberating\n\n1:32:02.700 --> 1:32:05.020\n in their nervous systems and will eventually wick out\n\n1:32:05.020 --> 1:32:06.260\n to others.\n\n1:32:06.260 --> 1:32:07.700\n So it's not just about feedback,\n\n1:32:07.700 --> 1:32:11.120\n it's about a venue for parsing information.\n\n1:32:11.120 --> 1:32:13.700\n So you actually posted that we're gonna talk on Instagram\n\n1:32:13.700 --> 1:32:15.460\n and I collected a bunch of the questions,\n\n1:32:15.460 --> 1:32:20.460\n which reminds me of, I have to mention Mike Jones\n\n1:32:21.040 --> 1:32:24.780\n and a question he asked, but also a gift he gave\n\n1:32:24.780 --> 1:32:26.860\n quite a while ago, if it's okay.\n\n1:32:26.860 --> 1:32:29.140\n But first, a quick bathroom break.\n\n1:32:29.140 --> 1:32:30.460\n Yes.\n\n1:32:30.460 --> 1:32:33.180\n We're looking at an Instagram page of Mike Jones,\n\n1:32:33.180 --> 1:32:35.580\n Knife and Tool, you should check it out.\n\n1:32:35.580 --> 1:32:39.480\n He, Andrew gave me a gift from him,\n\n1:32:39.480 --> 1:32:44.260\n that is a badass butcher knife.\n\n1:32:44.260 --> 1:32:46.660\n Yours is the earth, da, da, da,\n\n1:32:46.660 --> 1:32:48.820\n is from If by Richard Kipling.\n\n1:32:48.820 --> 1:32:52.020\n Yeah, the story of this knife is kind of interesting,\n\n1:32:52.020 --> 1:32:53.740\n perhaps, to people where it was,\n\n1:32:53.740 --> 1:32:56.100\n I was coming out here to Austin to meet with Lex\n\n1:32:56.100 --> 1:32:57.900\n and it was his birthday.\n\n1:32:57.900 --> 1:33:00.140\n I wanna get him a gift, but I didn't know what to get him.\n\n1:33:00.140 --> 1:33:02.460\n And I contacted this guy, Mike Jones,\n\n1:33:02.460 --> 1:33:04.480\n that I learned about through Joe Rogan.\n\n1:33:04.480 --> 1:33:08.380\n Cause the first, remember in the old days of Joe Rogan,\n\n1:33:08.380 --> 1:33:09.920\n when you go on the episode afterwards,\n\n1:33:09.920 --> 1:33:11.660\n you take a picture with an object.\n\n1:33:11.660 --> 1:33:13.780\n So it was like Elon with a flamethrower\n\n1:33:13.780 --> 1:33:14.760\n or people would have the ax.\n\n1:33:14.760 --> 1:33:18.820\n I picked up this Bushwhacker hatchet thing.\n\n1:33:18.820 --> 1:33:21.100\n And I was like, I love this thing.\n\n1:33:21.100 --> 1:33:22.700\n And Joe said, oh yeah, you should check out\n\n1:33:22.700 --> 1:33:25.500\n Mike Jones's work, he does these beautiful knives.\n\n1:33:25.500 --> 1:33:29.180\n And so then I heard your episode with Joe\n\n1:33:29.180 --> 1:33:31.140\n and you recited a poem at the end.\n\n1:33:31.140 --> 1:33:33.320\n It was right after your grandmother died.\n\n1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:36.880\n And there's a line in that poem from If\n\n1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:39.540\n that Mike engraved on that knife for you.\n\n1:33:39.540 --> 1:33:41.740\n So he makes these by hand.\n\n1:33:41.740 --> 1:33:46.740\n I love, the old days, before the podcast and all that.\n\n1:33:47.980 --> 1:33:48.820\n That's the first appearance.\n\n1:33:48.820 --> 1:33:50.620\n That was the first time on there.\n\n1:33:50.620 --> 1:33:55.380\n And it was a lot of fun in the old studio in Los Angeles.\n\n1:33:55.380 --> 1:33:59.180\n And yeah, Mike makes these beautiful knives.\n\n1:33:59.180 --> 1:34:02.340\n And I have this, I just have a great admiration\n\n1:34:02.340 --> 1:34:04.540\n for crafts people.\n\n1:34:04.540 --> 1:34:06.260\n So, do you use it?\n\n1:34:06.260 --> 1:34:08.540\n Do you cut your one meal a day steaks with it?\n\n1:34:08.540 --> 1:34:10.140\n I feel.\n\n1:34:10.140 --> 1:34:11.660\n Are you taking it with you on your travels?\n\n1:34:11.660 --> 1:34:12.820\n Exactly.\n\n1:34:12.820 --> 1:34:15.260\n I actually used to keep it on the table,\n\n1:34:15.260 --> 1:34:18.340\n but I thought it really intimidates guests.\n\n1:34:18.340 --> 1:34:19.280\n A little bit.\n\n1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:20.120\n But like.\n\n1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:20.940\n You can put it on their side.\n\n1:34:20.940 --> 1:34:21.900\n Yeah, right.\n\n1:34:21.900 --> 1:34:22.780\n It's like, oops.\n\n1:34:22.780 --> 1:34:24.980\n It's trust, right?\n\n1:34:24.980 --> 1:34:26.300\n What's the story?\n\n1:34:26.300 --> 1:34:27.460\n I mean, yeah.\n\n1:34:27.460 --> 1:34:28.940\n But it's, cause it's not,\n\n1:34:30.620 --> 1:34:33.580\n it's quite bad ass if I may say.\n\n1:34:33.580 --> 1:34:37.860\n So the craftsmanship is obvious, but also it is a knife.\n\n1:34:37.860 --> 1:34:40.140\n It's got some like Dexter like qualities to it.\n\n1:34:40.140 --> 1:34:40.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:34:40.980 --> 1:34:43.660\n It looks like it's designed to cleave through a limb.\n\n1:34:43.660 --> 1:34:46.040\n If I had like a family or something where people,\n\n1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:49.940\n there's nothing about this place that softens your kind\n\n1:34:49.940 --> 1:34:54.620\n of sense that this person might not murder me.\n\n1:34:54.620 --> 1:34:56.780\n Let's put it differently.\n\n1:34:56.780 --> 1:34:58.900\n This place could use a woman's touch.\n\n1:34:58.900 --> 1:35:00.820\n That's one way to put it.\n\n1:35:00.820 --> 1:35:01.820\n If it's okay, let me,\n\n1:35:01.820 --> 1:35:06.820\n because it is a poem I go to often actually.\n\n1:35:09.140 --> 1:35:10.760\n You mentioned reciting some lyrics\n\n1:35:10.760 --> 1:35:13.260\n and I'm actually gonna go back to that at some point\n\n1:35:13.260 --> 1:35:15.560\n to get a few songs that touch you.\n\n1:35:17.380 --> 1:35:20.060\n But this is one of the things I go to often.\n\n1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:23.200\n I'll read it to remind myself.\n\n1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:27.940\n It's advice from a father to son.\n\n1:35:27.940 --> 1:35:31.100\n And it's a kind of mantra that it's just nice to live by.\n\n1:35:31.100 --> 1:35:31.940\n So if it's okay with me,\n\n1:35:31.940 --> 1:35:34.260\n just use this opportunity one more time.\n\n1:35:34.260 --> 1:35:36.520\n Read If by Roger Kipling.\n\n1:35:36.520 --> 1:35:38.820\n If you can keep your head when all about you\n\n1:35:38.820 --> 1:35:41.540\n are losing theirs and blaming it on you,\n\n1:35:41.540 --> 1:35:44.300\n if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you\n\n1:35:44.300 --> 1:35:47.020\n but make allowance for their doubting too,\n\n1:35:47.020 --> 1:35:49.940\n if you can wait to not be tired by waiting\n\n1:35:49.940 --> 1:35:53.020\n or being lied about don't deal in lies\n\n1:35:53.020 --> 1:35:55.940\n or being hated don't give way to hating\n\n1:35:55.940 --> 1:35:59.740\n and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise.\n\n1:35:59.740 --> 1:36:02.740\n If you can dream and not make dreams your master,\n\n1:36:02.740 --> 1:36:05.860\n if you can think and not make thoughts your aim,\n\n1:36:05.860 --> 1:36:08.300\n if you can meet with triumph and disaster\n\n1:36:08.300 --> 1:36:11.420\n and treat those two imposters just the same,\n\n1:36:11.420 --> 1:36:14.180\n if you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken\n\n1:36:14.180 --> 1:36:17.020\n twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools\n\n1:36:17.020 --> 1:36:20.660\n or watch the things you gave your life to broken\n\n1:36:20.660 --> 1:36:24.420\n and stoop and build them up with worn out tools,\n\n1:36:24.420 --> 1:36:26.980\n if you can make one heap of all your winnings\n\n1:36:26.980 --> 1:36:30.740\n and risk it all on one turn of pitch and toss\n\n1:36:30.740 --> 1:36:34.180\n and lose and start again at your beginnings\n\n1:36:34.180 --> 1:36:37.180\n and never breathe a word about your loss,\n\n1:36:37.180 --> 1:36:40.000\n if you can force your heart to nerve and sinew\n\n1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.940\n to serve your turn long after they're gone\n\n1:36:42.940 --> 1:36:46.220\n and so hold on when there's nothing in you\n\n1:36:46.220 --> 1:36:49.300\n except the will which says to them, hold on.\n\n1:36:49.300 --> 1:36:53.240\n If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\n\n1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:55.680\n I like this one, and walk with kings\n\n1:36:55.680 --> 1:36:58.600\n nor lose the common touch, if neither foes\n\n1:36:58.600 --> 1:37:00.680\n nor loving friends can hurt you,\n\n1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:05.580\n if all men count with you but none too much,\n\n1:37:05.580 --> 1:37:07.980\n if you can fill the unforgiving minute\n\n1:37:07.980 --> 1:37:10.600\n with 60 seconds worth of distance run,\n\n1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:15.680\n yours is the earth and everything that's in it\n\n1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:19.080\n and which is more, you'll be a man, my son.\n\n1:37:19.080 --> 1:37:20.920\n Thank you, Andrew, thank you, thank you, Mike,\n\n1:37:20.920 --> 1:37:23.560\n for the knife, it's a, I don't know.\n\n1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:24.880\n It's an important poem.\n\n1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:28.080\n And engraved in it, yeah, it's yours.\n\n1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:31.320\n Yours is the earth and everything that's in it.\n\n1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:34.160\n We toiled over what to engrave,\n\n1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:36.320\n and then finally I just said, Mike,\n\n1:37:36.320 --> 1:37:38.860\n just pick something that speaks to you,\n\n1:37:38.860 --> 1:37:41.120\n you're the craftsman, and so he selected that.\n\n1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:42.920\n There's certain ways to pull yourself in that book.\n\n1:37:42.920 --> 1:37:47.920\n Actually, Karl Deisseroth, he wrote the book Projections.\n\n1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:50.080\n One of my favorite, first of all,\n\n1:37:50.080 --> 1:37:53.080\n just as you said, incredible writer.\n\n1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:57.900\n Just, I mean, if you wrote fiction,\n\n1:37:57.900 --> 1:37:59.000\n if you wrote those kinds of things,\n\n1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.600\n I'm curious to see where he goes with his writing.\n\n1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:02.440\n It's very interesting.\n\n1:38:02.440 --> 1:38:04.880\n I think that book took him 10 years to write,\n\n1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:06.520\n which is vindication for me and for you\n\n1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:07.860\n because we're both supposed to write books\n\n1:38:07.860 --> 1:38:08.960\n and we haven't done it.\n\n1:38:10.680 --> 1:38:13.600\n Yeah, I mean, in some sense,\n\n1:38:13.600 --> 1:38:18.600\n your first book will have decades in it, right?\n\n1:38:20.700 --> 1:38:23.640\n Even if you just take a half a year to write it.\n\n1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:27.300\n It's like the first book, like the first album for a musician,\n\n1:38:27.300 --> 1:38:28.900\n I mean, it's a journey.\n\n1:38:30.360 --> 1:38:35.140\n But he uses poems and quotes in there really well.\n\n1:38:35.140 --> 1:38:36.040\n It's a beautiful book.\n\n1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:36.860\n It's a dreamy book.\n\n1:38:36.860 --> 1:38:39.560\n I think when people hear that it's a book about neuroscience,\n\n1:38:39.560 --> 1:38:41.240\n they think they're gonna get a textbook\n\n1:38:41.240 --> 1:38:44.200\n or a protocols book or something, it's nothing like that.\n\n1:38:44.200 --> 1:38:46.500\n But it really is a deep dive into the mind\n\n1:38:46.500 --> 1:38:48.140\n of the psychiatrist and the researcher\n\n1:38:48.140 --> 1:38:50.600\n and so much feeling and compassion.\n\n1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:51.880\n I love that you love poetry.\n\n1:38:51.880 --> 1:38:53.480\n I mean, I didn't know that until I saw you\n\n1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:58.480\n on Rogan Read If and I'm not a very rabid consumer of poetry\n\n1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:03.180\n but I'm a big Wendell Berry fan.\n\n1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:10.640\n And I try and read a poem once every few days.\n\n1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:13.400\n Also, I think if is a tough act to follow.\n\n1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:14.760\n Oh yeah, oh yeah.\n\n1:39:14.760 --> 1:39:18.320\n I mean, that's the richness and the, I mean,\n\n1:39:18.320 --> 1:39:21.480\n you said every third line in there is something\n\n1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:25.440\n that you would consider your life well lived\n\n1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:27.760\n if you said that, right?\n\n1:39:27.760 --> 1:39:31.440\n What about the preparation for the solo podcast?\n\n1:39:31.440 --> 1:39:34.120\n You said you listen to certain songs,\n\n1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:37.200\n you sing or recite the lyrics to certain songs.\n\n1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:39.320\n Is there ones that kind of come to mind\n\n1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:40.680\n that are interesting?\n\n1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:43.640\n Um, yeah, I've always been very lyrics driven\n\n1:39:43.640 --> 1:39:45.400\n and I don't understand music.\n\n1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:46.600\n I've talked to Rick about this.\n\n1:39:46.600 --> 1:39:47.720\n I think I've talked to you about this a little bit.\n\n1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:50.840\n I don't really understand, I mean,\n\n1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:53.920\n I can hear music and like it,\n\n1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:56.580\n but I don't really understand the structure of it.\n\n1:39:56.580 --> 1:39:57.420\n But lyrics make a lot of sense to me.\n\n1:39:57.420 --> 1:40:00.400\n But does it touch your soul, music, or is it the lyrics?\n\n1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:02.280\n It's the lyrics, it's not the instrumentals.\n\n1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:04.080\n So I'm a huge Joe Strummer fan\n\n1:40:04.080 --> 1:40:05.880\n and I'm gonna lose punk points for saying this\n\n1:40:05.880 --> 1:40:07.320\n but I'm not a Clash fan.\n\n1:40:07.320 --> 1:40:08.280\n Oh, okay.\n\n1:40:08.280 --> 1:40:10.240\n So he obviously is best known for the Clash.\n\n1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:12.640\n Most Clash songs start off great\n\n1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:15.520\n and then after about 30 seconds, at least in my mind,\n\n1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:17.840\n just kind of disintegrate into a bunch of mush.\n\n1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:21.100\n Whereas Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros,\n\n1:40:21.100 --> 1:40:23.320\n which is what he did as an adult,\n\n1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:25.880\n as a later and some of his solo work,\n\n1:40:25.880 --> 1:40:28.000\n he actually, Rick produced some work\n\n1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.240\n that he did with Johnny Cash.\n\n1:40:30.240 --> 1:40:31.920\n Rick pulled Johnny Cash out of,\n\n1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:33.060\n essentially out of retirement\n\n1:40:33.060 --> 1:40:35.920\n and had him do his albums before he died.\n\n1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:38.720\n And so anything that Strummer did,\n\n1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:40.920\n there's a favorite song of mine by Strummer,\n\n1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:43.040\n it's called Burning Lights.\n\n1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:44.680\n You can find it, there is an album now\n\n1:40:44.680 --> 1:40:46.360\n where you can find it or Tennessee Rain\n\n1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:47.320\n or some of these things that he did,\n\n1:40:47.320 --> 1:40:49.920\n which are a little bit more folky, so not really punk.\n\n1:40:49.920 --> 1:40:52.160\n So I love that song.\n\n1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:54.440\n Bunch of songs by Rancid that I love.\n\n1:40:54.440 --> 1:40:55.880\n Yeah, Rancid is great.\n\n1:40:55.880 --> 1:40:57.920\n And then if I listen to instrumentals,\n\n1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:01.800\n I do, I'll listen to classical piano.\n\n1:41:01.800 --> 1:41:04.400\n Some dreams are made for children.\n\n1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:06.080\n But it's not gonna sound good as a poem.\n\n1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:07.720\n They can play the, people can play the song.\n\n1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:08.720\n Play the song, okay.\n\n1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:12.880\n Yeah, so I'll, I mean, cause it has to be something,\n\n1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:14.880\n Joe's voice is what makes the song.\n\n1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:15.880\n Got it.\n\n1:41:15.880 --> 1:41:17.120\n Joe's voice is what makes the song.\n\n1:41:17.120 --> 1:41:18.760\n But yeah, that song Burning Lights\n\n1:41:18.760 --> 1:41:21.800\n from I Hired a Contract Killer.\n\n1:41:21.800 --> 1:41:23.080\n I don't know, the licks are pretty good.\n\n1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:23.920\n They're pretty good.\n\n1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:25.480\n I mean, Joe is an amazing writer, right?\n\n1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:27.920\n I'm also a big Bob Dylan fan.\n\n1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:30.040\n Glenn Gould for classical piano.\n\n1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:33.360\n He was at Asperger's, and actually I think\n\n1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:36.800\n you can hear him grunting, he had a Tourette's like tick.\n\n1:41:36.800 --> 1:41:40.640\n And I learned about Glenn Gould from Oliver Sacks.\n\n1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:42.080\n So I'll listen to any number of things.\n\n1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:43.040\n It depends on my mood.\n\n1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:44.200\n If I'm feeling a little more tired\n\n1:41:44.200 --> 1:41:45.680\n and I need to be amped up,\n\n1:41:45.680 --> 1:41:48.040\n I'll listen to something that's a little louder and faster.\n\n1:41:48.040 --> 1:41:49.560\n If I'm feeling kind of keyed up\n\n1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:52.040\n and I need to bring the cadence down a little bit,\n\n1:41:53.080 --> 1:41:55.880\n then I'll listen to something a little mellower, poppier.\n\n1:41:55.880 --> 1:42:00.120\n I love bands like, yeah, I'm a big fan\n\n1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:02.880\n of this British pop band called James.\n\n1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:04.760\n There's like 20 bands named James.\n\n1:42:04.760 --> 1:42:06.360\n But this one, you know, and again,\n\n1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:09.320\n I lose punk points for saying that, but they're amazing.\n\n1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:10.160\n And best luck.\n\n1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:11.320\n I think you've accumulated enough points\n\n1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:13.760\n where you can afford to lose a few.\n\n1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:15.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:18.800\n But in any case, yeah, music and poetry are,\n\n1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:21.880\n they're the subconscious, right?\n\n1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:23.600\n I mean, if you think about a Bob Dylan song\n\n1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:25.960\n or a really good Strummer song or a poem\n\n1:42:25.960 --> 1:42:29.080\n that the words don't mean anything when read linearly,\n\n1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:30.660\n but they make you feel something,\n\n1:42:30.660 --> 1:42:32.880\n they're tapping into the subconscious.\n\n1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:34.120\n That's really what they're doing.\n\n1:42:34.120 --> 1:42:38.440\n They're pulling on neural threads of emotion\n\n1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:41.280\n based on either timbre or cadence\n\n1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:45.480\n or something that's independent of the word structure.\n\n1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:48.640\n And that to me is the beauty of music and poetry.\n\n1:42:48.640 --> 1:42:51.720\n I often say Johnny Cash's version, Hurt,\n\n1:42:51.720 --> 1:42:55.040\n that I say would be my favorite song ever.\n\n1:42:55.040 --> 1:42:56.680\n Well, he did a Nine Inch Nails song.\n\n1:42:56.680 --> 1:42:57.520\n He did, he covered.\n\n1:42:57.520 --> 1:42:58.840\n I think Rick produced that.\n\n1:42:58.840 --> 1:42:59.680\n Pretty sure he produced that.\n\n1:42:59.680 --> 1:43:01.080\n He produced it.\n\n1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:04.120\n I mean, he did, like Rick produced the,\n\n1:43:04.120 --> 1:43:08.000\n he pulled Johnny Cash out from a dark place\n\n1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:11.040\n to produce something that, I mean,\n\n1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:15.440\n when you look back as one of the great things ever in music,\n\n1:43:15.440 --> 1:43:19.320\n which are these like haunting covers\n\n1:43:19.320 --> 1:43:21.960\n of certain songs and originals.\n\n1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:25.160\n Johnny Cash and Joe Strummer did a version\n\n1:43:25.160 --> 1:43:30.040\n of Redemption song together that Rick produced,\n\n1:43:30.040 --> 1:43:33.800\n which is on loop in my house sometimes,\n\n1:43:33.800 --> 1:43:35.560\n for hours and hours.\n\n1:43:35.560 --> 1:43:37.000\n That song is fascinating.\n\n1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:38.720\n Bob Marley's song.\n\n1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:41.200\n Song by Johnny Cash and Joe Strummer.\n\n1:43:41.200 --> 1:43:43.200\n You know, sometimes I think what it would be\n\n1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:46.120\n to be a fly on the wall when these guys were doing this.\n\n1:43:46.120 --> 1:43:48.520\n These songs of freedom.\n\n1:43:48.520 --> 1:43:51.140\n There's certain songs where you're like,\n\n1:43:51.140 --> 1:43:56.140\n it elicits an emotion that's unlike anything else.\n\n1:43:58.660 --> 1:44:01.980\n I mean, I was trying to figure that out with Rick, too.\n\n1:44:01.980 --> 1:44:04.620\n Like, there's certain songs that make you wanna pull out\n\n1:44:04.620 --> 1:44:07.340\n over to the side of the road and just weep\n\n1:44:07.340 --> 1:44:11.660\n or just get inspired to just get shit done\n\n1:44:11.660 --> 1:44:13.260\n or all of those kinds of things.\n\n1:44:13.260 --> 1:44:16.620\n Remember your family, the people you've lost,\n\n1:44:16.620 --> 1:44:17.460\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:44:17.460 --> 1:44:20.980\n When you hurt, I hurt myself today\n\n1:44:20.980 --> 1:44:22.940\n to see if I still feel.\n\n1:44:22.940 --> 1:44:26.080\n There's certain songs that I've loved so much\n\n1:44:26.080 --> 1:44:29.380\n that I actually won't play them during a relationship\n\n1:44:29.380 --> 1:44:32.660\n until the relationship passes a certain duration\n\n1:44:32.660 --> 1:44:35.560\n because if you start sharing in those experiences\n\n1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:38.020\n with somebody and it starts to become associated\n\n1:44:38.020 --> 1:44:40.180\n with the relationship, you braiding it in\n\n1:44:40.180 --> 1:44:43.860\n with the dopamine of love and that relationship ends,\n\n1:44:43.860 --> 1:44:45.480\n the song is forever tainted.\n\n1:44:45.480 --> 1:44:47.220\n There are certain songs that I will never play\n\n1:44:47.220 --> 1:44:49.260\n in the company of anybody else.\n\n1:44:49.260 --> 1:44:50.620\n They're mine.\n\n1:44:50.620 --> 1:44:54.980\n I just, it's too risky to give those up.\n\n1:44:54.980 --> 1:44:58.900\n And you know, and I think that.\n\n1:44:58.900 --> 1:45:00.700\n And there's like levels.\n\n1:45:00.700 --> 1:45:04.020\n There are levels, right, exactly.\n\n1:45:04.020 --> 1:45:05.820\n We'll leave it at that.\n\n1:45:05.820 --> 1:45:10.020\n Yeah, and the interesting thing about this kind\n\n1:45:10.020 --> 1:45:12.900\n of preparing for the solo episode,\n\n1:45:14.060 --> 1:45:17.140\n just interacting with Rick about that process\n\n1:45:17.140 --> 1:45:22.140\n of preparation and because you mentioned with interviews.\n\n1:45:23.420 --> 1:45:25.140\n By the way, are you do solo, solo?\n\n1:45:25.140 --> 1:45:26.900\n Are you the only one in the room or?\n\n1:45:26.900 --> 1:45:30.180\n No, well, it used to be Rob, my producer,\n\n1:45:30.180 --> 1:45:33.900\n who I should say, you know, he's really the person\n\n1:45:33.900 --> 1:45:35.540\n behind the podcast.\n\n1:45:35.540 --> 1:45:37.540\n I mean, first of all, we're equal partners.\n\n1:45:37.540 --> 1:45:38.900\n You're just a pretty face.\n\n1:45:40.180 --> 1:45:41.900\n We're just, and I'm aging, man.\n\n1:45:41.900 --> 1:45:43.340\n Not to say I love him.\n\n1:45:43.340 --> 1:45:45.500\n I actually really, I like aging.\n\n1:45:45.500 --> 1:45:46.340\n It's weird.\n\n1:45:46.340 --> 1:45:47.900\n I'm like friends with David Sinclair\n\n1:45:47.900 --> 1:45:49.540\n and it's all about not aging.\n\n1:45:49.540 --> 1:45:52.540\n I don't wanna live past 90, 95.\n\n1:45:52.540 --> 1:45:54.340\n I'm just trying to get as much done as I can\n\n1:45:54.340 --> 1:45:56.020\n in this short life and do it right\n\n1:45:56.020 --> 1:46:00.820\n and with integrity and heart and accuracy, you know.\n\n1:46:00.820 --> 1:46:02.460\n And you like the stages.\n\n1:46:02.460 --> 1:46:05.340\n Oh yeah, if you read Erickson's stages of development,\n\n1:46:05.340 --> 1:46:08.620\n you realize that every stage of life\n\n1:46:08.620 --> 1:46:12.140\n is a set of neural circuits trying to resolve a problem.\n\n1:46:12.140 --> 1:46:16.140\n And if you're gonna try and avoid that progression\n\n1:46:16.140 --> 1:46:19.820\n sure, you might live longer, but you know,\n\n1:46:19.820 --> 1:46:21.140\n it's sort of like saying like,\n\n1:46:21.140 --> 1:46:25.380\n do you wanna go win the high school jujitsu championship?\n\n1:46:25.380 --> 1:46:28.540\n No, you graduated high school a long time ago, right?\n\n1:46:28.540 --> 1:46:32.140\n So I actually look forward to the future,\n\n1:46:32.140 --> 1:46:34.980\n even if it means that I'm starting to shift.\n\n1:46:34.980 --> 1:46:37.060\n I think that my biology will shift.\n\n1:46:37.060 --> 1:46:37.900\n Oh, you know, I'll fight that.\n\n1:46:37.900 --> 1:46:39.140\n I try and take good care of myself,\n\n1:46:39.140 --> 1:46:41.140\n but I don't wanna get sick.\n\n1:46:41.140 --> 1:46:43.060\n I don't wanna suffer, who does?\n\n1:46:43.060 --> 1:46:46.580\n But I'm embracing this whole developmental arc.\n\n1:46:46.580 --> 1:46:49.780\n I mean, we're not children and then adults.\n\n1:46:49.780 --> 1:46:52.820\n Our entire life is one long developmental arc.\n\n1:46:52.820 --> 1:46:54.780\n And if you fail to embrace that,\n\n1:46:54.780 --> 1:46:56.420\n you fail to extract the richness\n\n1:46:56.420 --> 1:46:58.620\n of what it is to be a human being.\n\n1:46:58.620 --> 1:47:03.620\n So in any event, I record Rob is in the room.\n\n1:47:05.780 --> 1:47:08.060\n I'll sometimes stop and ask him for feedback\n\n1:47:08.060 --> 1:47:09.740\n if I feel like something's not landing right.\n\n1:47:09.740 --> 1:47:11.580\n So he gives, if it's clear, he'll let me know.\n\n1:47:11.580 --> 1:47:12.820\n If it's not clear, he'll let me know.\n\n1:47:12.820 --> 1:47:13.660\n Excuse me.\n\n1:47:13.660 --> 1:47:15.580\n And then, you know, Costello used to be in the room.\n\n1:47:15.580 --> 1:47:18.380\n The early days of the podcast, which weren't that long ago,\n\n1:47:19.300 --> 1:47:22.180\n he's snoring at my feet and farting\n\n1:47:22.180 --> 1:47:23.180\n and smelling up the room.\n\n1:47:23.180 --> 1:47:24.980\n And we're all just kind of like gasping for air.\n\n1:47:24.980 --> 1:47:25.820\n He's a bulldog.\n\n1:47:25.820 --> 1:47:26.860\n That's what they do.\n\n1:47:26.860 --> 1:47:28.900\n With him gone, it changed.\n\n1:47:28.900 --> 1:47:30.180\n You know, the whole thing changed.\n\n1:47:30.180 --> 1:47:31.740\n There will be another dog soon.\n\n1:47:32.700 --> 1:47:35.300\n And as you know, I've been moving\n\n1:47:35.300 --> 1:47:36.540\n through that grief process,\n\n1:47:36.540 --> 1:47:41.540\n but having him there gave me a levity that I miss.\n\n1:47:41.540 --> 1:47:43.100\n But in my mind, he's still there.\n\n1:47:43.100 --> 1:47:43.940\n Yeah, he's still there.\n\n1:47:43.940 --> 1:47:44.900\n Yeah, he's still there.\n\n1:47:44.900 --> 1:47:47.740\n So, and you know, in time there'll be another dog\n\n1:47:47.740 --> 1:47:49.780\n and who knows, you know, maybe there'll be a dog\n\n1:47:49.780 --> 1:47:51.300\n and a couple of infants running around,\n\n1:47:51.300 --> 1:47:52.820\n but that would be more distracting.\n\n1:47:52.820 --> 1:47:57.820\n So, but it's, there's no podcast that exists\n\n1:47:58.020 --> 1:47:59.540\n just because of the podcaster.\n\n1:47:59.540 --> 1:48:01.820\n This is true for Joe, this is true for your podcast,\n\n1:48:01.820 --> 1:48:03.860\n for me, that there's, it's not just a staff\n\n1:48:03.860 --> 1:48:05.220\n of people to post stuff.\n\n1:48:05.220 --> 1:48:07.060\n That's just the top level contour.\n\n1:48:07.060 --> 1:48:09.220\n There's the constant feedback and iteration\n\n1:48:09.220 --> 1:48:11.620\n of what you want it to become\n\n1:48:11.620 --> 1:48:14.540\n and trying to hold on to something\n\n1:48:14.540 --> 1:48:16.540\n that's essential along the way.\n\n1:48:16.540 --> 1:48:17.620\n Cause everything has to evolve,\n\n1:48:17.620 --> 1:48:20.460\n but you can't lose the essence of something.\n\n1:48:20.460 --> 1:48:24.100\n Anytime a company or brand or a course\n\n1:48:24.100 --> 1:48:27.820\n or a scientist has done that, it just ends up terrible.\n\n1:48:27.820 --> 1:48:29.180\n It just is a, you know, it becomes\n\n1:48:29.180 --> 1:48:31.380\n like a Senator version of itself.\n\n1:48:31.380 --> 1:48:35.660\n So to Rick is very, the power of the people in the room\n\n1:48:35.660 --> 1:48:39.700\n is great to inspire and to destroy.\n\n1:48:39.700 --> 1:48:42.140\n So you have to be extremely careful\n\n1:48:42.140 --> 1:48:44.460\n with the selection of people that are in the room.\n\n1:48:44.460 --> 1:48:46.540\n To me, I never really thought of it that way.\n\n1:48:46.540 --> 1:48:50.980\n I thought only positive things can happen.\n\n1:48:50.980 --> 1:48:51.900\n Oh, by adding people in the room?\n\n1:48:51.900 --> 1:48:52.740\n By adding people in the room.\n\n1:48:52.740 --> 1:48:55.300\n Oh, I think if there were an audience in the room for,\n\n1:48:55.300 --> 1:48:56.540\n well, you know what, someday I'd love\n\n1:48:56.540 --> 1:48:58.180\n to do a live podcast with you.\n\n1:48:59.420 --> 1:49:01.980\n I saw you doing like a couple of live things,\n\n1:49:01.980 --> 1:49:04.380\n which is great that you're paving the way there to try.\n\n1:49:04.380 --> 1:49:06.140\n Well, we did one, I went up to University\n\n1:49:06.140 --> 1:49:11.140\n of British Columbia and did a lecture on a college campus.\n\n1:49:11.700 --> 1:49:13.780\n And one of the more gratifying things that happened\n\n1:49:13.780 --> 1:49:16.060\n is this kid, he's in his early twenties, I think,\n\n1:49:16.060 --> 1:49:17.580\n stood up and said, you know,\n\n1:49:17.580 --> 1:49:19.740\n I've never been on a college campus.\n\n1:49:19.740 --> 1:49:22.140\n I didn't think I could go onto a college campus.\n\n1:49:22.140 --> 1:49:23.500\n And that still rings in my mind.\n\n1:49:23.500 --> 1:49:25.340\n Whoever you are out there, that meant so much to me.\n\n1:49:25.340 --> 1:49:27.740\n Cause I was like, yes, there was something about that to me.\n\n1:49:27.740 --> 1:49:30.300\n I was like, okay, this, it made sense to come all the way\n\n1:49:30.300 --> 1:49:31.620\n up here and do this in person.\n\n1:49:31.620 --> 1:49:34.700\n Cause you can get out to a lot more people online.\n\n1:49:34.700 --> 1:49:35.660\n Public speaking events,\n\n1:49:35.660 --> 1:49:37.580\n it's not like it's that lucrative or anything.\n\n1:49:37.580 --> 1:49:39.300\n I mean, unless you're whatever,\n\n1:49:39.300 --> 1:49:41.780\n you're a famous celebrity or politician or something,\n\n1:49:41.780 --> 1:49:43.120\n I'm sure there are people that do well with it,\n\n1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:44.700\n but that's not what it's about for us.\n\n1:49:44.700 --> 1:49:47.260\n It's really about being able to connect with people\n\n1:49:47.260 --> 1:49:50.740\n in a different venue and for interactions like that.\n\n1:49:50.740 --> 1:49:53.700\n I don't know how many of them we will do,\n\n1:49:53.700 --> 1:49:55.500\n but I'm curious to see how it goes,\n\n1:49:55.500 --> 1:49:57.940\n but I'd love to do a podcast with you.\n\n1:49:57.940 --> 1:50:02.940\n Is it energizing? My fear is the fear of the introvert\n\n1:50:03.780 --> 1:50:08.020\n is that I don't know if I can handle so much love\n\n1:50:08.020 --> 1:50:11.940\n and fascinating people all around.\n\n1:50:11.940 --> 1:50:14.020\n It's like, I don't know.\n\n1:50:14.020 --> 1:50:16.180\n Well, we'll invite a few haters too.\n\n1:50:16.180 --> 1:50:19.900\n Well, yes, but I love the haters too, but I don't know.\n\n1:50:19.900 --> 1:50:20.860\n It makes me nervous.\n\n1:50:20.860 --> 1:50:23.140\n Cause Jordan Peterson is currently on tour.\n\n1:50:23.140 --> 1:50:24.460\n I got a chance to hang out with him.\n\n1:50:24.460 --> 1:50:28.180\n Oh right, he does a lot of live speaking.\n\n1:50:28.180 --> 1:50:31.900\n Yeah, he's now on tour where he does like every other day.\n\n1:50:33.300 --> 1:50:35.460\n But he doesn't have any small kids at home anymore.\n\n1:50:35.460 --> 1:50:36.580\n So you can't do that.\n\n1:50:36.580 --> 1:50:38.180\n So yeah, you should do it before you have a fan.\n\n1:50:38.180 --> 1:50:39.020\n It's also exhausting.\n\n1:50:39.020 --> 1:50:42.380\n I mean, I'm just speaking from an athlete perspective,\n\n1:50:42.380 --> 1:50:45.980\n like if you're Mick Jagger with the Rolling Stones,\n\n1:50:45.980 --> 1:50:50.980\n it's just physically, I mean, you have to speak potentially\n\n1:50:50.980 --> 1:50:55.980\n for two hours, then off stage, like hanging out with people.\n\n1:50:56.620 --> 1:50:58.460\n It's a lot of hours.\n\n1:50:58.460 --> 1:51:00.020\n It's a lot of hours to stay focused,\n\n1:51:00.020 --> 1:51:04.460\n to keep finding your place of like calmness and excitement.\n\n1:51:04.460 --> 1:51:05.700\n Well, and you're staying in hotels,\n\n1:51:05.700 --> 1:51:07.540\n your circadian rhythm is disrupted.\n\n1:51:07.540 --> 1:51:09.420\n You're not getting your like cold and sauna\n\n1:51:09.420 --> 1:51:10.380\n and your workout every day.\n\n1:51:10.380 --> 1:51:11.820\n Your food isn't optimal.\n\n1:51:12.780 --> 1:51:15.620\n I think done in patches, I could enjoy it\n\n1:51:15.620 --> 1:51:17.220\n because it's fun to meet people from different places.\n\n1:51:17.220 --> 1:51:19.900\n I'm doing a public lecture in Copenhagen\n\n1:51:19.900 --> 1:51:22.820\n for the Lundbeck Foundation in June, June 3rd.\n\n1:51:22.820 --> 1:51:25.020\n And that one is particularly gratifying for me\n\n1:51:25.020 --> 1:51:27.580\n because the Lundbeck Foundation is an academic foundation.\n\n1:51:27.580 --> 1:51:29.500\n So the fact that, and then so when they invited,\n\n1:51:29.500 --> 1:51:31.740\n I asked, do you want me to talk about what my lab does\n\n1:51:31.740 --> 1:51:33.580\n or do you want me to talk about the stuff on the podcast?\n\n1:51:33.580 --> 1:51:35.500\n They're like, no, no, not your lab.\n\n1:51:35.500 --> 1:51:37.460\n We want to hear about this, like health stuff\n\n1:51:37.460 --> 1:51:39.380\n and the stuff that we cover on the podcast.\n\n1:51:39.380 --> 1:51:43.300\n So that was amusing to me and tells me that things\n\n1:51:43.300 --> 1:51:44.140\n are changing now.\n\n1:51:44.140 --> 1:51:47.180\n I think 2020 and 2021 revealed a lot of things\n\n1:51:47.180 --> 1:51:50.060\n about people to ourselves.\n\n1:51:50.060 --> 1:51:52.020\n But one thing that it made very clear\n\n1:51:52.020 --> 1:51:55.700\n is that there's an enormous appetite for tools\n\n1:51:55.700 --> 1:51:56.740\n for mental and physical health,\n\n1:51:56.740 --> 1:51:58.100\n but also understanding about science\n\n1:51:58.100 --> 1:51:59.580\n and how science is done.\n\n1:51:59.580 --> 1:52:02.420\n So thanks to you, again, I'm not saying this to flatter you.\n\n1:52:02.420 --> 1:52:03.740\n It's true gratitude.\n\n1:52:03.740 --> 1:52:07.300\n There's now a runway for scientists to talk to people.\n\n1:52:07.300 --> 1:52:09.060\n I mean, you had the, I always forget this guy's name,\n\n1:52:09.060 --> 1:52:10.940\n the virus guy from Columbia.\n\n1:52:10.940 --> 1:52:12.140\n It's a wrecking yellow.\n\n1:52:12.140 --> 1:52:13.340\n Yeah, amazing, right?\n\n1:52:13.340 --> 1:52:16.460\n I mean, forgetting the controversy around all the stuff\n\n1:52:16.460 --> 1:52:17.500\n of 2020, 21.\n\n1:52:17.500 --> 1:52:21.860\n I mean, he is an encyclopedia of all things virology.\n\n1:52:21.860 --> 1:52:24.460\n Yeah, people should listen to his podcast\n\n1:52:24.460 --> 1:52:25.660\n this week in virology.\n\n1:52:25.660 --> 1:52:28.140\n He's also an incredible lecturer and educator.\n\n1:52:28.140 --> 1:52:30.340\n It's fascinating.\n\n1:52:30.340 --> 1:52:33.580\n It's fascinating when people take again that leap\n\n1:52:33.580 --> 1:52:36.060\n of putting all that education online.\n\n1:52:36.060 --> 1:52:39.220\n That's non controversial at all.\n\n1:52:39.220 --> 1:52:43.300\n It's like everybody there, people should go listen to him\n\n1:52:43.300 --> 1:52:47.580\n for the most part in terms of, at his best, at least.\n\n1:52:47.580 --> 1:52:48.780\n There's no politics in it.\n\n1:52:48.780 --> 1:52:50.140\n There's none of that.\n\n1:52:50.140 --> 1:52:51.660\n No, he's a virus jockey.\n\n1:52:51.660 --> 1:52:55.700\n He likes playing around with bacteria and viruses and.\n\n1:52:55.700 --> 1:52:57.820\n But that said, molecular biology.\n\n1:52:57.820 --> 1:53:00.480\n We all say stuff carelessly all the time.\n\n1:53:00.480 --> 1:53:02.700\n So he gets in a bit of trouble on some of the things\n\n1:53:02.700 --> 1:53:06.500\n you've said about like dismissing lab leak theory.\n\n1:53:06.500 --> 1:53:07.940\n Like, there's no way.\n\n1:53:07.940 --> 1:53:08.780\n He dismisses that.\n\n1:53:08.780 --> 1:53:10.940\n Yeah, but not, he's not making,\n\n1:53:10.940 --> 1:53:15.940\n like folks, there's a difference when you say stuff\n\n1:53:16.580 --> 1:53:20.820\n like off the cuff and when you say stuff\n\n1:53:20.820 --> 1:53:22.340\n that's like courts your principles\n\n1:53:22.340 --> 1:53:25.060\n and you've thought about it for a very long time.\n\n1:53:25.060 --> 1:53:28.340\n You talking for hours, for hundreds of hours\n\n1:53:28.340 --> 1:53:29.660\n and you can just say stuff.\n\n1:53:29.660 --> 1:53:31.360\n You could just say your opinions.\n\n1:53:32.860 --> 1:53:34.780\n Will Smith slapped.\n\n1:53:34.780 --> 1:53:36.020\n I was wondering, okay, wait,\n\n1:53:36.020 --> 1:53:37.180\n how long have we been recording?\n\n1:53:37.180 --> 1:53:38.580\n I was wondering how long it was gonna take us\n\n1:53:38.580 --> 1:53:40.300\n before someone talked about Ukraine.\n\n1:53:40.300 --> 1:53:41.340\n No, no, Will Smith.\n\n1:53:41.340 --> 1:53:43.240\n I was wondering whether or not we'd make it the end.\n\n1:53:43.240 --> 1:53:45.020\n I had it planned.\n\n1:53:45.020 --> 1:53:46.940\n I was literally in the back of my mind.\n\n1:53:46.940 --> 1:53:48.420\n I had it planned that at the end,\n\n1:53:48.420 --> 1:53:50.860\n if we didn't talk about the Will Smith, Chris Rock thing,\n\n1:53:50.860 --> 1:53:52.920\n that I was gonna say, it's amazing.\n\n1:53:52.920 --> 1:53:54.580\n This is the first conversation to happen\n\n1:53:54.580 --> 1:53:58.040\n in a long time where it wasn't mentioned.\n\n1:53:58.040 --> 1:53:59.460\n Oh, no.\n\n1:53:59.460 --> 1:54:01.020\n No, do not pull it up.\n\n1:54:01.020 --> 1:54:01.860\n We don't need to see it.\n\n1:54:01.860 --> 1:54:02.680\n We don't need to see it.\n\n1:54:02.680 --> 1:54:03.520\n Here we go.\n\n1:54:03.520 --> 1:54:04.340\n It revealed some interesting things\n\n1:54:04.340 --> 1:54:08.900\n about human beings, impulse control and lack thereof.\n\n1:54:08.900 --> 1:54:11.760\n But, you know, oh my goodness.\n\n1:54:11.760 --> 1:54:13.940\n Chris Rock has a material for the rest of his career.\n\n1:54:13.940 --> 1:54:16.620\n Yeah, I think he's not short on material.\n\n1:54:16.620 --> 1:54:21.140\n But I do, see, if I knew what I wanted to tweet,\n\n1:54:21.140 --> 1:54:23.620\n if I knew you a lot to just slap comedians,\n\n1:54:23.620 --> 1:54:25.020\n my conversation with Tim Dillon\n\n1:54:25.020 --> 1:54:27.140\n would have gone very differently.\n\n1:54:27.140 --> 1:54:29.220\n People just being humans.\n\n1:54:29.220 --> 1:54:33.260\n There's so much fascinating human nature on display there.\n\n1:54:33.260 --> 1:54:37.460\n It's also, in terms of it becoming a topic\n\n1:54:37.460 --> 1:54:39.380\n that a lot of people are talking about\n\n1:54:39.380 --> 1:54:41.020\n versus the war in Ukraine, for example,\n\n1:54:41.020 --> 1:54:42.280\n is also fascinating to watch,\n\n1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:46.180\n like just these kind of news cycles moving through.\n\n1:54:46.180 --> 1:54:48.140\n I think, if I may, I'm sorry to interrupt,\n\n1:54:48.140 --> 1:54:53.020\n but, you know, anytime we observe something very limbic,\n\n1:54:53.020 --> 1:54:55.260\n very emotional, you know,\n\n1:54:55.260 --> 1:54:59.660\n we generally can empathize somewhat, right?\n\n1:54:59.660 --> 1:55:00.980\n We all know what it's like to feel angry.\n\n1:55:00.980 --> 1:55:02.260\n We all know what it's like to feel ashamed.\n\n1:55:02.260 --> 1:55:04.500\n We all know what it's like to feel shocked.\n\n1:55:04.500 --> 1:55:09.380\n Images of war are, for most people, very hard to relate to.\n\n1:55:09.380 --> 1:55:12.460\n We see it, it's, you know, there are these images\n\n1:55:12.460 --> 1:55:15.260\n and they're very traumatic and challenging\n\n1:55:15.260 --> 1:55:16.100\n to look at at times,\n\n1:55:16.100 --> 1:55:17.500\n and yet most people have no idea\n\n1:55:17.500 --> 1:55:19.780\n what it feels like to be shot at\n\n1:55:19.780 --> 1:55:21.660\n or what it feels like to have your home destroyed\n\n1:55:21.660 --> 1:55:26.260\n or what it feels like to be an aggressor in that way.\n\n1:55:26.260 --> 1:55:29.180\n So it's very, so I think that people naturally orient\n\n1:55:29.180 --> 1:55:31.780\n towards things that feel familiar to them,\n\n1:55:31.780 --> 1:55:33.540\n even though the circumstances are different.\n\n1:55:33.540 --> 1:55:36.500\n And people also forget, they look at these celebrities,\n\n1:55:37.780 --> 1:55:39.900\n that's just like looking at criticism of Will Smith,\n\n1:55:39.900 --> 1:55:43.220\n you forget that they're human too.\n\n1:55:43.220 --> 1:55:45.580\n That's one of the most surprising things for me,\n\n1:55:45.580 --> 1:55:48.300\n having done this podcast and met celebrities\n\n1:55:48.300 --> 1:55:50.020\n and stuff like that.\n\n1:55:50.020 --> 1:55:52.020\n They're human, they're all human.\n\n1:55:52.020 --> 1:55:53.140\n And that's inspiring to me,\n\n1:55:53.140 --> 1:55:55.980\n like some of these great folks that have won Nobel Prizes\n\n1:55:55.980 --> 1:55:57.460\n and built some cool things,\n\n1:55:57.460 --> 1:55:59.460\n they're just human, like the rest of us.\n\n1:55:59.460 --> 1:56:01.420\n Well, and if you look at actors and actresses,\n\n1:56:01.420 --> 1:56:03.060\n I mean, there's some amazing ones, right?\n\n1:56:03.060 --> 1:56:05.260\n And who also do well in the outside life,\n\n1:56:05.260 --> 1:56:09.740\n but their careers were built on the business\n\n1:56:09.740 --> 1:56:12.900\n of pretending to be other people.\n\n1:56:12.900 --> 1:56:16.460\n And that's got to distort maybe positively,\n\n1:56:16.460 --> 1:56:19.020\n but also just let's be honest,\n\n1:56:19.020 --> 1:56:21.020\n what it is that the neuroplasticity there,\n\n1:56:21.020 --> 1:56:22.860\n the changes in the areas of the brain\n\n1:56:22.860 --> 1:56:25.420\n that represent personality have to be quite different\n\n1:56:25.420 --> 1:56:26.700\n for somebody who pretends to be\n\n1:56:26.700 --> 1:56:28.940\n lots of different personalities and gets paid for it.\n\n1:56:28.940 --> 1:56:30.820\n You're working the reward system\n\n1:56:30.820 --> 1:56:33.260\n into the system of self identity.\n\n1:56:33.260 --> 1:56:37.260\n And you have to imagine that that can really\n\n1:56:38.500 --> 1:56:41.220\n contort somebody's neurology\n\n1:56:41.220 --> 1:56:43.780\n in ways that maybe they are not as,\n\n1:56:43.780 --> 1:56:45.860\n maybe they are not in touch with reality\n\n1:56:45.860 --> 1:56:47.060\n in the same way that we are.\n\n1:56:47.060 --> 1:56:47.940\n Remember earlier we were talking about\n\n1:56:47.940 --> 1:56:49.420\n neurotic versus psychotic.\n\n1:56:50.300 --> 1:56:52.180\n They may be more borderline\n\n1:56:53.140 --> 1:56:56.100\n in their kind of ground state than we think.\n\n1:56:56.100 --> 1:56:58.260\n And so I'm actually impressed anytime there's a celebrity\n\n1:56:58.260 --> 1:57:00.540\n who doesn't have a messed up life.\n\n1:57:00.540 --> 1:57:02.900\n I'm like, oh wow, finally somebody who's managed\n\n1:57:02.900 --> 1:57:05.860\n to maintain some semblance,\n\n1:57:05.860 --> 1:57:08.260\n at least from the outside, of normalcy.\n\n1:57:08.260 --> 1:57:11.300\n So first of all, I can empathize\n\n1:57:11.300 --> 1:57:14.140\n with the actions that Will Smith did, right?\n\n1:57:14.140 --> 1:57:16.500\n They're not, I think they're kind of,\n\n1:57:16.500 --> 1:57:18.540\n not kind of, they're just shitty.\n\n1:57:18.540 --> 1:57:21.580\n You should probably talk privately, man to man,\n\n1:57:21.580 --> 1:57:24.660\n not, because otherwise it's like a dramatic display.\n\n1:57:24.660 --> 1:57:27.980\n It's almost like you are a fake, you're acting.\n\n1:57:27.980 --> 1:57:29.740\n Well, there are all these questions, right?\n\n1:57:29.740 --> 1:57:33.140\n I mean, obviously it was aggressive at some level.\n\n1:57:33.140 --> 1:57:36.180\n There's this question of whether or not it was impulsive.\n\n1:57:36.180 --> 1:57:37.380\n I think most people feel yes.\n\n1:57:37.380 --> 1:57:39.540\n There's a question, there was the protective nature of it\n\n1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:42.220\n because he was doing it to, you know,\n\n1:57:42.220 --> 1:57:43.940\n apparently in defense.\n\n1:57:43.940 --> 1:57:47.180\n But then there's also the context,\n\n1:57:47.180 --> 1:57:49.480\n he lost touch with the context, right?\n\n1:57:50.620 --> 1:57:52.740\n Whereas Chris Rock basically gets,\n\n1:57:53.700 --> 1:57:56.740\n there's the possible critique that he went too far.\n\n1:57:56.740 --> 1:57:59.140\n That's gonna be in the eye of the beholder.\n\n1:57:59.140 --> 1:58:01.620\n But then, and depending on how you view comedy and jokes,\n\n1:58:01.620 --> 1:58:04.100\n but then there's also the fact that he took that slap\n\n1:58:04.100 --> 1:58:05.220\n and then just snapped right back,\n\n1:58:05.220 --> 1:58:07.500\n so much so that people thought maybe it was fake.\n\n1:58:07.500 --> 1:58:10.020\n He also waited with his hands behind his back.\n\n1:58:10.020 --> 1:58:12.260\n That's just natural, he likes to stand like that.\n\n1:58:12.260 --> 1:58:17.260\n I mean, I got to a little bit of a story here\n\n1:58:18.260 --> 1:58:22.740\n to connect to what Chris Rock did.\n\n1:58:22.740 --> 1:58:27.260\n Like I wish, what Chris Rock did in terms of just\n\n1:58:27.260 --> 1:58:28.540\n taking the slap and keep going,\n\n1:58:28.540 --> 1:58:30.720\n first of all, just props for somebody\n\n1:58:30.720 --> 1:58:33.740\n that's able to maintain cool in that situation\n\n1:58:33.740 --> 1:58:35.220\n for the most part.\n\n1:58:35.220 --> 1:58:36.900\n I think I like watched it once.\n\n1:58:36.900 --> 1:58:39.300\n You only have to be alive on this planet\n\n1:58:39.300 --> 1:58:42.060\n to see it, you can't avoid seeing it.\n\n1:58:42.060 --> 1:58:47.060\n I wish at that afterwards, he would sort of say something\n\n1:58:47.860 --> 1:58:52.460\n loving and kind to Will Smith and his wife\n\n1:58:52.460 --> 1:58:56.180\n and then hit him real hard, lean into the joke.\n\n1:58:56.180 --> 1:59:00.100\n But I think in hockey, they call it taking a number.\n\n1:59:00.100 --> 1:59:01.700\n I have a friend who plays hockey and there's this idea\n\n1:59:01.700 --> 1:59:04.500\n that if someone checks you really badly in one game,\n\n1:59:04.500 --> 1:59:06.260\n you don't go and check them again,\n\n1:59:06.260 --> 1:59:07.240\n you don't get into a fight.\n\n1:59:07.240 --> 1:59:11.120\n But three games later, you blade them in the shin.\n\n1:59:14.700 --> 1:59:18.220\n The ability to defer and to handle it\n\n1:59:18.220 --> 1:59:20.260\n in whatever fashion one feels is appropriate.\n\n1:59:20.260 --> 1:59:22.540\n They're probably also friends and all those kinds of things\n\n1:59:22.540 --> 1:59:25.900\n that they respect each other, so he probably didn't,\n\n1:59:25.900 --> 1:59:27.740\n but there's a comedian instinct.\n\n1:59:27.740 --> 1:59:32.740\n I saw this, I was at an open mic here in Texas.\n\n1:59:33.300 --> 1:59:35.620\n I won't say where, there's many open mics.\n\n1:59:35.620 --> 1:59:36.460\n Have you gone to a few of these?\n\n1:59:36.460 --> 1:59:37.460\n These are pretty good.\n\n1:59:37.460 --> 1:59:42.460\n No, so there is more sort of rougher kind of.\n\n1:59:44.180 --> 1:59:47.420\n Yeah, you've been hanging out in West Texas lately.\n\n1:59:47.420 --> 1:59:50.540\n Austin's too tame for Lex, so he's headed to West Texas.\n\n1:59:50.540 --> 1:59:53.180\n Exactly, I put on a cowboy hat\n\n1:59:53.180 --> 1:59:54.700\n and instantly I became a cowboy.\n\n1:59:54.700 --> 1:59:56.580\n I've been talking like a cowboy.\n\n1:59:56.580 --> 1:59:58.940\n I mean, I belong out there in the desert.\n\n1:59:58.940 --> 2:00:02.180\n He's gone from eating meat and athletic greens\n\n2:00:02.180 --> 2:00:03.980\n to rattlesnakes, rattlesnake jerky.\n\n2:00:03.980 --> 2:00:04.940\n Exactly.\n\n2:00:04.940 --> 2:00:08.460\n No, there was a, open mic is late at night\n\n2:00:08.460 --> 2:00:11.100\n and I was one of the only people in the audience.\n\n2:00:11.100 --> 2:00:15.340\n There's a couple of drunk folks, a few drunk folks.\n\n2:00:15.340 --> 2:00:20.340\n One of them was a couple, like bikers with helmets and so on,\n\n2:00:22.620 --> 2:00:23.500\n a guy and a girl.\n\n2:00:23.500 --> 2:00:27.580\n And then the comedian, the open mic comedian,\n\n2:00:28.740 --> 2:00:31.780\n did a joke about people who wear helmets.\n\n2:00:31.780 --> 2:00:33.340\n I don't know if it was on purpose or not,\n\n2:00:33.340 --> 2:00:34.780\n but he did the joke.\n\n2:00:34.780 --> 2:00:38.980\n And then the guy about women who wear helmets.\n\n2:00:38.980 --> 2:00:41.780\n And the guy, it's this exact same situation.\n\n2:00:41.780 --> 2:00:44.180\n The guy stood up, walked up to him.\n\n2:00:44.180 --> 2:00:45.020\n There was no slap.\n\n2:00:45.020 --> 2:00:45.860\n It's so interesting,\n\n2:00:45.860 --> 2:00:47.940\n because this happened before the Will Smith thing.\n\n2:00:47.940 --> 2:00:51.180\n So he walked up to the comedian\n\n2:00:51.180 --> 2:00:56.180\n and said, I think he pointed his finger down\n\n2:00:59.300 --> 2:01:01.380\n and told him to stop or something like that.\n\n2:01:01.380 --> 2:01:02.900\n And then sat down.\n\n2:01:02.900 --> 2:01:05.540\n This is an audience of like six people.\n\n2:01:05.540 --> 2:01:09.140\n And at midnight around then, there's nobody,\n\n2:01:09.140 --> 2:01:10.460\n no security, nothing.\n\n2:01:10.460 --> 2:01:11.300\n In Texas.\n\n2:01:11.300 --> 2:01:12.140\n In Texas.\n\n2:01:12.140 --> 2:01:12.980\n Which implies.\n\n2:01:12.980 --> 2:01:16.220\n And then this guy was the energy drunk,\n\n2:01:16.220 --> 2:01:21.220\n but also a biker and what he felt his lady\n\n2:01:23.100 --> 2:01:25.660\n was now attacked by the comedian, right?\n\n2:01:25.660 --> 2:01:26.540\n With his words.\n\n2:01:27.940 --> 2:01:32.900\n And the comedian was a kind of out of shape, small guy.\n\n2:01:32.900 --> 2:01:37.180\n So he's not threatening at all and probably in trouble.\n\n2:01:37.180 --> 2:01:39.220\n And the comedian, after he sat down,\n\n2:01:39.220 --> 2:01:41.340\n he looked a little bit scared.\n\n2:01:41.340 --> 2:01:43.620\n He paced back and forth.\n\n2:01:43.620 --> 2:01:47.580\n And then he did the joke again.\n\n2:01:47.580 --> 2:01:48.660\n Wow.\n\n2:01:48.660 --> 2:01:50.820\n And I was sitting and I started,\n\n2:01:50.820 --> 2:01:53.300\n I leaned back and I just did this like,\n\n2:01:55.140 --> 2:01:56.980\n because that is comedy.\n\n2:01:56.980 --> 2:02:00.620\n And the guy was getting angrier and angrier.\n\n2:02:00.620 --> 2:02:02.500\n And he just sat there.\n\n2:02:02.500 --> 2:02:06.100\n And the comedian went on for a couple more minutes\n\n2:02:06.100 --> 2:02:09.300\n and then did another bad joke,\n\n2:02:09.300 --> 2:02:10.660\n but another joke about him.\n\n2:02:10.660 --> 2:02:12.700\n It's just like, he leaned into it.\n\n2:02:12.700 --> 2:02:15.820\n If you go to a small comedy club, open mic or otherwise,\n\n2:02:15.820 --> 2:02:17.220\n you're in the shooting gallery.\n\n2:02:17.220 --> 2:02:21.900\n Like you're basically there teed up as a pin to get it.\n\n2:02:21.900 --> 2:02:24.340\n We went and saw Andrew Scholls in San Francisco.\n\n2:02:24.340 --> 2:02:25.180\n In San Francisco?\n\n2:02:25.180 --> 2:02:26.380\n Yeah, it was hilarious.\n\n2:02:26.380 --> 2:02:27.220\n It was amazing.\n\n2:02:27.220 --> 2:02:30.020\n I mean, he's just masterful in his ability\n\n2:02:30.020 --> 2:02:32.500\n to command an audience.\n\n2:02:32.500 --> 2:02:34.380\n But I felt for the people up front,\n\n2:02:34.380 --> 2:02:37.420\n but no sympathy either because you buy tickets\n\n2:02:37.420 --> 2:02:41.460\n to sit up front at a Scholls show, you're gonna get it.\n\n2:02:41.460 --> 2:02:43.140\n But he was very loving.\n\n2:02:43.140 --> 2:02:44.660\n Yeah, and funny.\n\n2:02:44.660 --> 2:02:46.100\n First of all, funny.\n\n2:02:46.100 --> 2:02:48.300\n The funniness really helps you.\n\n2:02:48.300 --> 2:02:52.820\n But the ethic of the comedian is like that fearlessness.\n\n2:02:52.820 --> 2:02:57.540\n What I really liked is like the danger,\n\n2:02:57.540 --> 2:03:00.700\n there's risk to comedy and there's also consequences.\n\n2:03:00.700 --> 2:03:02.300\n Have you watched that show?\n\n2:03:02.300 --> 2:03:03.140\n What is it?\n\n2:03:03.140 --> 2:03:04.580\n The Marvelous Miss Maisel show?\n\n2:03:04.580 --> 2:03:05.820\n It's really good.\n\n2:03:05.820 --> 2:03:07.740\n I watched a few of them.\n\n2:03:07.740 --> 2:03:09.100\n Guilty pleasure there.\n\n2:03:09.100 --> 2:03:14.100\n She plays a comic in the, I think it's mid 1960s in New York.\n\n2:03:14.940 --> 2:03:18.940\n And there's a character that somewhat resembles Lenny Bruce.\n\n2:03:18.940 --> 2:03:21.220\n It's sort of meant to be Lenny Bruce.\n\n2:03:21.220 --> 2:03:24.260\n And they're always getting arrested and this kind of thing.\n\n2:03:24.260 --> 2:03:25.620\n I think I learned about it from Joe.\n\n2:03:25.620 --> 2:03:27.180\n Anyway, the writing is great.\n\n2:03:27.180 --> 2:03:28.020\n It's very funny.\n\n2:03:29.260 --> 2:03:32.460\n But yeah, comedy is designed to push boundaries, right?\n\n2:03:32.460 --> 2:03:36.940\n And to say the thing that other people aren't,\n\n2:03:36.940 --> 2:03:38.180\n feel they can't say.\n\n2:03:38.180 --> 2:03:39.460\n Not something in science, right?\n\n2:03:39.460 --> 2:03:40.460\n Science you're supposed to,\n\n2:03:40.460 --> 2:03:43.340\n etiquette is a big part of how you communicate ideas.\n\n2:03:43.340 --> 2:03:46.300\n It's about constraining communication.\n\n2:03:46.300 --> 2:03:48.420\n This is something, I mean, I confess on the podcast,\n\n2:03:48.420 --> 2:03:52.500\n in the goals of making it clear, interesting,\n\n2:03:52.500 --> 2:03:54.500\n surprising and actionable,\n\n2:03:54.500 --> 2:03:57.100\n you have to constrain the amount\n\n2:03:57.100 --> 2:03:58.420\n and the style of information.\n\n2:03:58.420 --> 2:04:01.260\n Otherwise it becomes something else altogether, right?\n\n2:04:02.780 --> 2:04:05.460\n I saw Sandra Perchay, Google CEO,\n\n2:04:05.460 --> 2:04:08.620\n said that he likes the thing you mentioned,\n\n2:04:08.620 --> 2:04:11.940\n not the yoga nidra, but the NSDR,\n\n2:04:11.940 --> 2:04:15.020\n non sleep deep rest podcast over meditation.\n\n2:04:15.900 --> 2:04:16.940\n I don't know if you saw that.\n\n2:04:16.940 --> 2:04:18.380\n Yeah, I saw that, yeah.\n\n2:04:18.380 --> 2:04:19.460\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:19.460 --> 2:04:20.300\n Why?\n\n2:04:20.300 --> 2:04:21.140\n What do you think that is?\n\n2:04:21.140 --> 2:04:22.500\n What do you think the difference is?\n\n2:04:22.500 --> 2:04:25.460\n Yeah, so non sleep deep rest, NSDR is an acronym\n\n2:04:25.460 --> 2:04:28.420\n that I coined because it encompasses a lot of practices\n\n2:04:28.420 --> 2:04:31.180\n that are not meditation per se,\n\n2:04:31.180 --> 2:04:32.780\n but that bring the brain and body\n\n2:04:32.780 --> 2:04:34.940\n into a state of relaxation and focus.\n\n2:04:34.940 --> 2:04:37.100\n So hypnosis is one variant of NSDR.\n\n2:04:37.100 --> 2:04:38.580\n There are other variants of NSDR.\n\n2:04:38.580 --> 2:04:40.620\n You can just look these up and you'll find them.\n\n2:04:40.620 --> 2:04:42.460\n And I think that they've caught on\n\n2:04:42.460 --> 2:04:47.460\n and that the CEO of Google is an avid practitioner of NSDR\n\n2:04:49.620 --> 2:04:51.580\n because it has this amazing ability\n\n2:04:51.580 --> 2:04:53.980\n to reset your energy levels and focus.\n\n2:04:53.980 --> 2:04:57.420\n Whereas with meditation, many people find meditation hard.\n\n2:04:57.420 --> 2:04:58.900\n And part of the reason they find it hard\n\n2:04:58.900 --> 2:05:00.980\n is that it requires focus.\n\n2:05:00.980 --> 2:05:04.380\n NSDR is a state which is very calm and relaxing.\n\n2:05:04.380 --> 2:05:05.580\n You don't have to work too hard.\n\n2:05:05.580 --> 2:05:06.820\n You're just listening to a script,\n\n2:05:06.820 --> 2:05:08.980\n whereas most forms of meditation, not all,\n\n2:05:08.980 --> 2:05:11.860\n but most forms of meditation involve cranking up\n\n2:05:11.860 --> 2:05:14.180\n the activity in your prefrontal cortex\n\n2:05:14.180 --> 2:05:16.620\n and trying to see your thoughts\n\n2:05:16.620 --> 2:05:18.020\n as opposed to thinking your thoughts\n\n2:05:18.020 --> 2:05:20.180\n or focus on your breath,\n\n2:05:20.180 --> 2:05:23.300\n but then third personing yourself in some respect\n\n2:05:23.300 --> 2:05:24.140\n and that's work.\n\n2:05:24.140 --> 2:05:26.540\n And so many people who meditate quite intensely\n\n2:05:26.540 --> 2:05:28.180\n feel more exhausted.\n\n2:05:28.180 --> 2:05:30.140\n Now that doesn't mean that meditation\n\n2:05:30.140 --> 2:05:31.580\n doesn't have any utility,\n\n2:05:31.580 --> 2:05:33.900\n but it's distinctly different than NSDR.\n\n2:05:33.900 --> 2:05:35.460\n And I think that people are working,\n\n2:05:35.460 --> 2:05:37.260\n certainly the CEO of Google I have to imagine\n\n2:05:37.260 --> 2:05:39.500\n is working very hard and using his forebrain.\n\n2:05:39.500 --> 2:05:42.260\n If he's going to have 20 or 30 minutes to take a break,\n\n2:05:42.260 --> 2:05:44.420\n he should, and I think this is what he's doing,\n\n2:05:44.420 --> 2:05:46.940\n he should go out for a jog and not listen to anything\n\n2:05:46.940 --> 2:05:48.780\n and just kind of let his mind wander\n\n2:05:48.780 --> 2:05:52.340\n or sit there in a chair and just zone out or do NSDR.\n\n2:05:52.340 --> 2:05:57.340\n The problem is people are not that good at shifting states.\n\n2:05:57.540 --> 2:05:59.300\n We are all actually pretty good at,\n\n2:05:59.300 --> 2:06:01.820\n even people with severe ADHD,\n\n2:06:01.820 --> 2:06:03.460\n we had an episode about this,\n\n2:06:03.460 --> 2:06:07.260\n can become hyper focused on things that they actually enjoy\n\n2:06:07.260 --> 2:06:10.460\n because dope and most of the drugs designed to treat ADHD\n\n2:06:10.460 --> 2:06:12.660\n are drugs that increase the levels of dopamine.\n\n2:06:12.660 --> 2:06:13.500\n So when you like something,\n\n2:06:13.500 --> 2:06:15.300\n there's dopamine release and you can focus.\n\n2:06:15.300 --> 2:06:17.140\n It's when you don't like something that's hard to focus,\n\n2:06:17.140 --> 2:06:18.860\n shifting states is hard.\n\n2:06:18.860 --> 2:06:19.900\n I'm sure you've experienced this.\n\n2:06:19.900 --> 2:06:22.180\n If you've ever been in deep research or podcasting,\n\n2:06:22.180 --> 2:06:24.580\n podcasting, and then all of a sudden you go for a run,\n\n2:06:24.580 --> 2:06:27.140\n you probably spend the first third of that run thinking.\n\n2:06:27.140 --> 2:06:28.420\n And then in the middle third,\n\n2:06:28.420 --> 2:06:30.900\n you're kind of that thinking is fractured a bit.\n\n2:06:30.900 --> 2:06:32.100\n And then in the final third\n\n2:06:32.100 --> 2:06:34.300\n is where you finally get to relax\n\n2:06:34.300 --> 2:06:37.100\n because the brain doesn't shift states very quickly.\n\n2:06:37.100 --> 2:06:39.140\n We can go from sleep to wakefulness quickly.\n\n2:06:39.140 --> 2:06:41.700\n We can go from wakefulness to sleep quickly,\n\n2:06:41.700 --> 2:06:45.020\n but we don't shift between different states of consciousness\n\n2:06:45.020 --> 2:06:49.420\n like a step function, except in rare cases, right?\n\n2:06:49.420 --> 2:06:50.420\n Fear is one.\n\n2:06:50.420 --> 2:06:51.980\n All of a sudden we hear an explosion right now,\n\n2:06:51.980 --> 2:06:52.860\n it's a step function.\n\n2:06:52.860 --> 2:06:55.660\n We're in fear or we're in alertness, right?\n\n2:06:56.740 --> 2:06:57.980\n A heightened state of alertness.\n\n2:06:57.980 --> 2:07:01.020\n But NSDR is terrific at allowing people\n\n2:07:01.020 --> 2:07:03.060\n to learn to shift their state.\n\n2:07:03.060 --> 2:07:05.500\n And I actually would venture to argue that\n\n2:07:07.420 --> 2:07:09.900\n part of the value of meditation and exercise\n\n2:07:09.900 --> 2:07:11.460\n is the actual state that you get into\n\n2:07:11.460 --> 2:07:13.420\n in deep meditation or exercise,\n\n2:07:13.420 --> 2:07:16.180\n but just as valuable is the transition\n\n2:07:16.180 --> 2:07:17.700\n that you have to take yourself through\n\n2:07:17.700 --> 2:07:20.940\n from one state of mind to the other and then back again.\n\n2:07:20.940 --> 2:07:23.980\n When I look, David Goggins, he always seems to come up\n\n2:07:23.980 --> 2:07:25.980\n because he represents so many important things,\n\n2:07:25.980 --> 2:07:29.660\n drive, determination, override of emotional state,\n\n2:07:29.660 --> 2:07:31.620\n going from being a 300 pound plus person\n\n2:07:31.620 --> 2:07:32.820\n to a fit person through,\n\n2:07:32.820 --> 2:07:35.620\n he's never revealed anything substantial\n\n2:07:35.620 --> 2:07:36.780\n about what he ate or what he didn't eat.\n\n2:07:36.780 --> 2:07:39.660\n He basically says like, listen, run a lot, eat less, right?\n\n2:07:40.980 --> 2:07:44.060\n But what's remarkable is so much of what he says\n\n2:07:44.060 --> 2:07:46.300\n is about those transitions,\n\n2:07:46.300 --> 2:07:48.980\n about taking oneself from a state of I don't want to\n\n2:07:48.980 --> 2:07:52.220\n to scruffing oneself and like you're gonna do it anyway.\n\n2:07:52.220 --> 2:07:55.460\n And then being able to carry that into regular life,\n\n2:07:55.460 --> 2:07:56.420\n so to speak.\n\n2:07:56.420 --> 2:08:00.140\n So I think that NSDR is immensely powerful.\n\n2:08:00.140 --> 2:08:01.260\n It's zero cost.\n\n2:08:01.260 --> 2:08:04.660\n And one of the reasons I'm such a fan of people doing it\n\n2:08:04.660 --> 2:08:08.220\n is that most people don't stick to a meditation practice.\n\n2:08:08.220 --> 2:08:09.380\n There are also been a few cases\n\n2:08:09.380 --> 2:08:10.300\n you might find this interesting.\n\n2:08:10.300 --> 2:08:11.940\n There's a book by Scott Carney.\n\n2:08:11.940 --> 2:08:13.100\n I forget what it's called.\n\n2:08:13.100 --> 2:08:15.220\n I think it's called the transcendence trap or something.\n\n2:08:15.220 --> 2:08:16.220\n I'm gonna have that title wrong,\n\n2:08:16.220 --> 2:08:20.100\n but there have been a fair number of cases of people\n\n2:08:20.100 --> 2:08:22.580\n that go and do very extensive meditation,\n\n2:08:22.580 --> 2:08:24.500\n silent meditation retreats,\n\n2:08:24.500 --> 2:08:28.060\n who then return to normal life and end up killing themselves.\n\n2:08:28.060 --> 2:08:31.340\n There are states of mind inside of extended meditations\n\n2:08:31.340 --> 2:08:34.020\n or silent meditations that are very beneficial.\n\n2:08:34.020 --> 2:08:37.020\n And I'm certainly not suggesting people don't meditate,\n\n2:08:37.020 --> 2:08:39.060\n but I know at least one person who came back\n\n2:08:39.060 --> 2:08:41.140\n from one of these long extended meditation retreats\n\n2:08:41.140 --> 2:08:43.740\n and wasn't able to shift their state back\n\n2:08:43.740 --> 2:08:45.700\n into one that was functional in regular life.\n\n2:08:45.700 --> 2:08:47.620\n And that book includes a very dramatic story.\n\n2:08:47.620 --> 2:08:50.300\n I don't wanna give it away in case people\n\n2:08:50.300 --> 2:08:51.140\n check out the book,\n\n2:08:51.140 --> 2:08:53.540\n but Scott told the story to me directly once,\n\n2:08:53.540 --> 2:08:58.140\n where someone feels they've reached enlightenment\n\n2:08:58.140 --> 2:09:00.500\n and then commit suicide.\n\n2:09:00.500 --> 2:09:03.100\n So these very unusual brain states\n\n2:09:03.100 --> 2:09:06.380\n are potentially hazardous if people can't return from them.\n\n2:09:07.260 --> 2:09:11.060\n So it's nice to focus not on those brain states,\n\n2:09:11.060 --> 2:09:12.580\n but instead on the shifting.\n\n2:09:12.580 --> 2:09:15.300\n Right, this morning I woke up a little bit earlier\n\n2:09:15.300 --> 2:09:16.140\n than I would have liked.\n\n2:09:16.140 --> 2:09:18.860\n I use this reverie app that's research backed,\n\n2:09:18.860 --> 2:09:20.620\n REVRI.com.\n\n2:09:20.620 --> 2:09:23.400\n There's a free version of it or you can try it for free.\n\n2:09:23.400 --> 2:09:24.240\n So I feel comfortable.\n\n2:09:24.240 --> 2:09:25.060\n That's for hypnosis?\n\n2:09:25.060 --> 2:09:25.900\n For hypnosis.\n\n2:09:25.900 --> 2:09:29.140\n And I do a self hypnosis to put me back into sleep.\n\n2:09:29.140 --> 2:09:29.980\n And if I can't sleep,\n\n2:09:29.980 --> 2:09:31.540\n you just put me into a state of deep relaxation.\n\n2:09:31.540 --> 2:09:35.300\n I would put hypnosis under the category of NSDR,\n\n2:09:35.300 --> 2:09:37.220\n yoga nidra under the category of NSDR.\n\n2:09:37.220 --> 2:09:39.500\n There are now some NSDR scripts online\n\n2:09:39.500 --> 2:09:42.100\n if you just go to YouTube that you can just listen to.\n\n2:09:42.100 --> 2:09:43.140\n Do you like those?\n\n2:09:43.140 --> 2:09:43.980\n I do, yeah.\n\n2:09:43.980 --> 2:09:45.340\n I think the one from made for is quite good.\n\n2:09:45.340 --> 2:09:46.860\n I have an affiliation with them, but it's free.\n\n2:09:46.860 --> 2:09:48.540\n So I feel comfortable mentioning it.\n\n2:09:48.540 --> 2:09:50.820\n I do, I really like the reverie app.\n\n2:09:50.820 --> 2:09:52.620\n I can vary.\n\n2:09:52.620 --> 2:09:53.700\n And as you, the more you do them,\n\n2:09:53.700 --> 2:09:55.000\n the more quickly you can shift your brain\n\n2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:56.740\n into a state of deep relaxation.\n\n2:09:56.740 --> 2:09:59.740\n I will sometimes stop mid podcast.\n\n2:09:59.740 --> 2:10:02.460\n If it's, sometimes our recordings go seven, eight hours\n\n2:10:02.460 --> 2:10:04.620\n and I'll stop and I'll do a one minute hypnosis.\n\n2:10:04.620 --> 2:10:06.540\n They have one minute hypnosis inside reverie.\n\n2:10:06.540 --> 2:10:08.140\n You're only going to,\n\n2:10:08.140 --> 2:10:10.220\n you're only going to find that one minute hypnosis\n\n2:10:10.220 --> 2:10:13.500\n is effective if you are routinely doing 10\n\n2:10:13.500 --> 2:10:16.940\n and 15 minute hypnosis in addition to that.\n\n2:10:16.940 --> 2:10:19.420\n Meaning I do it every other day or so at 10 or 15.\n\n2:10:19.420 --> 2:10:22.940\n So there's a, is there a YouTube one minute hypnosis\n\n2:10:22.940 --> 2:10:23.780\n or is this for the reverie?\n\n2:10:23.780 --> 2:10:25.460\n There are, but inside of reverie as well.\n\n2:10:25.460 --> 2:10:26.580\n You can find them online.\n\n2:10:26.580 --> 2:10:27.400\n A really good.\n\n2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:28.580\n Pull it up so I can see.\n\n2:10:28.580 --> 2:10:29.580\n Yeah, so reverie is good.\n\n2:10:29.580 --> 2:10:32.940\n And then Michael Sealy, S E A L E Y.\n\n2:10:32.940 --> 2:10:34.860\n He has some long hypnosis scripts, but again,\n\n2:10:34.860 --> 2:10:37.480\n these are all free and you know,\n\n2:10:37.480 --> 2:10:40.460\n there's a lot of good research now on the neural networks\n\n2:10:40.460 --> 2:10:42.380\n and it shifts your so called default network,\n\n2:10:42.380 --> 2:10:43.780\n the default mode network.\n\n2:10:43.780 --> 2:10:46.900\n It shifts how much of your forebrain you're using.\n\n2:10:46.900 --> 2:10:48.700\n And it also is very, very good.\n\n2:10:48.700 --> 2:10:51.900\n If I get so many questions about,\n\n2:10:51.900 --> 2:10:53.080\n hey, I'm really upset.\n\n2:10:53.080 --> 2:10:55.860\n I found out about my girlfriend's sexual past\n\n2:10:55.860 --> 2:10:57.120\n or, hey, I'm so upset.\n\n2:10:57.120 --> 2:10:58.420\n I found out that my boyfriend was cheating\n\n2:10:58.420 --> 2:10:59.940\n or, oh, so and so died.\n\n2:10:59.940 --> 2:11:01.300\n How do I get over these emotions?\n\n2:11:01.300 --> 2:11:02.380\n How do I deal with them?\n\n2:11:02.380 --> 2:11:05.060\n And hypnosis has shown to be very useful for people\n\n2:11:05.060 --> 2:11:07.180\n to learn to bring themselves into a state\n\n2:11:07.180 --> 2:11:12.060\n of deep relaxation, to literally project in their mind's eye\n\n2:11:12.060 --> 2:11:15.400\n these very intense things that they don't like.\n\n2:11:15.400 --> 2:11:19.600\n And then for people to associate with other emotions\n\n2:11:19.600 --> 2:11:21.440\n in their body to learn to be calm\n\n2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:23.660\n while feeling your feelings,\n\n2:11:23.660 --> 2:11:26.900\n to dissociate the mind body communication to some extent.\n\n2:11:26.900 --> 2:11:28.500\n Just observe the feelings.\n\n2:11:28.500 --> 2:11:30.360\n Observe them and start to associate them\n\n2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:31.840\n with positive experiences.\n\n2:11:31.840 --> 2:11:32.800\n You're an Android guy,\n\n2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:35.340\n so soon it should be available on Android.\n\n2:11:35.340 --> 2:11:36.700\n Then it doesn't exist for me.\n\n2:11:36.700 --> 2:11:37.540\n Yeah, I know.\n\n2:11:37.540 --> 2:11:38.900\n It's only, you know, I don't get it.\n\n2:11:38.900 --> 2:11:40.840\n Android is the device of the people,\n\n2:11:40.840 --> 2:11:43.300\n all you elitist people with your iPhones.\n\n2:11:43.300 --> 2:11:44.500\n Tell me this about Android.\n\n2:11:44.500 --> 2:11:48.260\n Now you want to, this is the one thing that gets me.\n\n2:11:48.260 --> 2:11:50.760\n Cause I'm very close to someone who uses an Android phone.\n\n2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:51.780\n I feel like that.\n\n2:11:51.780 --> 2:11:53.940\n So you have great people in your life.\n\n2:11:53.940 --> 2:11:54.780\n That's good to know.\n\n2:11:54.780 --> 2:11:56.780\n No, their messages always look green to me,\n\n2:11:56.780 --> 2:11:59.340\n but I answer yours, not despite that.\n\n2:12:00.200 --> 2:12:02.300\n But they, I feel like the Android phones\n\n2:12:02.300 --> 2:12:03.500\n are very trigger happy.\n\n2:12:03.500 --> 2:12:05.380\n Like anything I touch does something.\n\n2:12:05.380 --> 2:12:07.260\n Whereas the Apple phone is kind of built\n\n2:12:07.260 --> 2:12:10.100\n for like a macaque monkey to be able to operate,\n\n2:12:10.100 --> 2:12:12.500\n which is great for me because I'm more of a macaque monkey\n\n2:12:12.500 --> 2:12:14.180\n and you're a more sophisticated ape.\n\n2:12:14.180 --> 2:12:15.060\n Oh, I see.\n\n2:12:15.060 --> 2:12:15.900\n I see.\n\n2:12:15.900 --> 2:12:16.720\n I feel like that.\n\n2:12:16.720 --> 2:12:17.560\n I think like you have to be.\n\n2:12:17.560 --> 2:12:18.380\n They're more sensitive.\n\n2:12:18.380 --> 2:12:19.220\n Yeah, you have to have, you know, I mean,\n\n2:12:19.220 --> 2:12:22.220\n I've got fat fingers, you know, I've got clumsy fingers.\n\n2:12:22.220 --> 2:12:24.860\n The Android is too, well, maybe you need\n\n2:12:24.860 --> 2:12:26.480\n to soften your touch.\n\n2:12:26.480 --> 2:12:27.900\n What I would do is go into the most,\n\n2:12:27.900 --> 2:12:31.420\n sort by most popular, because there's some older ones\n\n2:12:31.420 --> 2:12:33.420\n that I really like and it generally scales with that.\n\n2:12:33.420 --> 2:12:35.500\n So I'll do the, this one,\n\n2:12:35.500 --> 2:12:38.900\n the hypnosis for clearing subconscious negativity.\n\n2:12:38.900 --> 2:12:40.020\n That's an hour long one.\n\n2:12:40.020 --> 2:12:41.840\n The sleep and anxiety one, 40 minutes,\n\n2:12:41.840 --> 2:12:44.100\n but those you listen to as you fall asleep.\n\n2:12:44.100 --> 2:12:44.940\n As you fall asleep.\n\n2:12:44.940 --> 2:12:45.780\n Oh, we're going to do this now?\n\n2:12:45.780 --> 2:12:48.180\n Yeah, yeah, let's listen to it.\n\n2:12:48.180 --> 2:12:52.100\n And I have created this hypnosis recording for you\n\n2:12:52.100 --> 2:12:53.060\n to help you.\n\n2:12:53.060 --> 2:12:53.940\n And this is the voice.\n\n2:12:53.940 --> 2:12:55.900\n How often does the voice pop up?\n\n2:12:55.900 --> 2:12:57.120\n And at the same time.\n\n2:12:57.120 --> 2:12:58.220\n You don't watch it.\n\n2:12:58.220 --> 2:12:59.140\n You just listen to it.\n\n2:12:59.140 --> 2:13:00.320\n Your anxiety.\n\n2:13:03.300 --> 2:13:05.420\n Now, one of the most important things.\n\n2:13:05.420 --> 2:13:06.420\n It's a great voice.\n\n2:13:06.420 --> 2:13:10.300\n At the outset of any self hypnosis experience\n\n2:13:10.300 --> 2:13:12.700\n is to know and understand.\n\n2:13:12.700 --> 2:13:16.880\n So people really should know that stage hypnosis\n\n2:13:16.880 --> 2:13:19.120\n is about the hypnotist getting you to do things\n\n2:13:19.120 --> 2:13:20.380\n you wouldn't normally do.\n\n2:13:21.260 --> 2:13:23.380\n Self hypnosis, which is what we're talking about here,\n\n2:13:23.380 --> 2:13:26.480\n reverie in this is about you getting your brain\n\n2:13:26.480 --> 2:13:28.500\n into the state that you want.\n\n2:13:28.500 --> 2:13:32.060\n And again, I mean, there's a ton of neuroimaging data\n\n2:13:32.060 --> 2:13:34.300\n and work on trauma and pain relief.\n\n2:13:34.300 --> 2:13:36.940\n And our labs are working on this with David Spiegel's lab.\n\n2:13:36.940 --> 2:13:39.340\n I really encourage people to explore NSDR.\n\n2:13:39.340 --> 2:13:41.560\n And if this feels a little too wacky and out there,\n\n2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:44.620\n then I would just put in NSDR into YouTube\n\n2:13:44.620 --> 2:13:46.500\n and there's some good NSDR scripts.\n\n2:13:46.500 --> 2:13:49.740\n Yeah, by the way, Sondar is a fan of your podcast.\n\n2:13:49.740 --> 2:13:50.940\n No, it's okay, we don't need to play it.\n\n2:13:50.940 --> 2:13:52.340\n Yeah, so I don't know him.\n\n2:13:53.780 --> 2:13:56.700\n But I get a lot of media outlets picked up\n\n2:13:56.700 --> 2:13:58.860\n on his love of NSDR.\n\n2:13:58.860 --> 2:14:01.680\n And I have to imagine running Google involves a lot of,\n\n2:14:01.680 --> 2:14:02.860\n juggling a lot of.\n\n2:14:02.860 --> 2:14:05.540\n He's one of the great CEOs because everybody loves him.\n\n2:14:05.540 --> 2:14:06.500\n Everybody loves him.\n\n2:14:06.500 --> 2:14:07.520\n Have you interviewed him?\n\n2:14:07.520 --> 2:14:10.300\n No, but we'll do the interview eventually.\n\n2:14:10.300 --> 2:14:13.660\n So it's this annoying thing about me being a stickler\n\n2:14:13.660 --> 2:14:17.440\n for three hours, CEOs don't seem to understand.\n\n2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:20.360\n Like, not understand, but it's scheduling.\n\n2:14:20.360 --> 2:14:23.580\n So what happens is Sondar said, yes, definitely, let's do it.\n\n2:14:23.580 --> 2:14:26.020\n I'm a fan of podcasts, is a fan of yours.\n\n2:14:26.020 --> 2:14:30.140\n And then he goes to his executive assistant like,\n\n2:14:30.140 --> 2:14:32.100\n oh, let's find a slot.\n\n2:14:32.100 --> 2:14:34.020\n And then they immediately think, all right,\n\n2:14:34.020 --> 2:14:35.380\n well, one hour is good.\n\n2:14:35.380 --> 2:14:36.340\n 45 minutes.\n\n2:14:36.340 --> 2:14:37.180\n 90 minutes.\n\n2:14:37.180 --> 2:14:38.000\n By Zoom.\n\n2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:39.260\n 90 minutes, yeah, right.\n\n2:14:39.260 --> 2:14:42.140\n Well, no, they know in person that I'm a stickler on that.\n\n2:14:42.140 --> 2:14:45.140\n But like, it's like, no, we need more.\n\n2:14:45.140 --> 2:14:47.500\n And it's so hard to.\n\n2:14:47.500 --> 2:14:49.540\n Do you still travel to do your podcast or generally?\n\n2:14:49.540 --> 2:14:50.820\n No, most people come down here.\n\n2:14:50.820 --> 2:14:55.820\n Most people, but for certain situations, obviously,\n\n2:14:55.980 --> 2:14:57.660\n like if you're in prison.\n\n2:14:57.660 --> 2:14:59.300\n Right.\n\n2:14:59.300 --> 2:15:00.140\n Or you're ahead of.\n\n2:15:00.140 --> 2:15:02.020\n Imagine if you get out on work for a lot of people\n\n2:15:02.020 --> 2:15:04.540\n that have anklets so that they can go to an Alex Friedman\n\n2:15:04.540 --> 2:15:05.740\n podcast, it'll probably happen.\n\n2:15:05.740 --> 2:15:07.340\n Have you ever been in a prison?\n\n2:15:07.340 --> 2:15:12.340\n No, you know, either a visitation or on the inside.\n\n2:15:13.180 --> 2:15:15.420\n From my hike, I can see San Quentin.\n\n2:15:15.420 --> 2:15:17.180\n It's really weird that San Quentin and Alcatraz,\n\n2:15:17.180 --> 2:15:18.700\n you know, Bay Area, beautiful, everyone thinks like,\n\n2:15:18.700 --> 2:15:21.220\n you know, like there's the Bay and there's Alcatraz\n\n2:15:21.220 --> 2:15:22.060\n and San Quentin sitting right there.\n\n2:15:22.060 --> 2:15:23.440\n Does that make you feel?\n\n2:15:24.860 --> 2:15:27.100\n You know, it's amazing how easy it is to overlook\n\n2:15:27.100 --> 2:15:28.500\n that they're there and forget that they're there.\n\n2:15:28.500 --> 2:15:31.720\n But when I drive by San Quentin, I think about it.\n\n2:15:31.720 --> 2:15:33.060\n I also think about the people who are in there\n\n2:15:33.060 --> 2:15:34.740\n who might be innocent.\n\n2:15:34.740 --> 2:15:37.220\n I've seen some of those episodes on Rogan and elsewhere.\n\n2:15:37.220 --> 2:15:40.140\n And Amanda Knox talks a lot about this, right?\n\n2:15:40.140 --> 2:15:42.560\n Whether or not you believe her story or not,\n\n2:15:42.560 --> 2:15:44.820\n I happen to believe her story, personally,\n\n2:15:44.820 --> 2:15:47.300\n based on what I know, what, you know,\n\n2:15:47.300 --> 2:15:48.820\n I'm sure there are people disagree with me.\n\n2:15:48.820 --> 2:15:52.780\n I think to myself, what it must be like to be in a cell\n\n2:15:52.780 --> 2:15:57.260\n and know in your heart's heart, you didn't do it, you know?\n\n2:15:57.260 --> 2:16:01.100\n I mean, I can't think of many things worse.\n\n2:16:01.100 --> 2:16:02.760\n I can't think of many things worse.\n\n2:16:02.760 --> 2:16:07.760\n That's so clearly unjust, but life is full of unjust things\n\n2:16:08.020 --> 2:16:12.500\n like this, cruel things happen all the time.\n\n2:16:12.500 --> 2:16:16.620\n You lose a loved one for no good reason.\n\n2:16:16.620 --> 2:16:17.860\n You lose your job.\n\n2:16:20.420 --> 2:16:21.660\n You lose your home.\n\n2:16:22.660 --> 2:16:24.500\n Yeah, I've been talking to a lot of refugees now,\n\n2:16:24.500 --> 2:16:27.000\n and the war in Ukraine has really focused my mind\n\n2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:29.220\n to how much suffering there is in the world.\n\n2:16:29.220 --> 2:16:32.180\n And so just cruel things happen all the time.\n\n2:16:32.180 --> 2:16:36.420\n And people kind of, there's this suffering,\n\n2:16:36.420 --> 2:16:38.740\n and you kind of go on.\n\n2:16:38.740 --> 2:16:41.180\n You stick to the people really close to you.\n\n2:16:41.180 --> 2:16:44.420\n There's still love all around you.\n\n2:16:44.420 --> 2:16:47.420\n Traumatic events kind of focus your mind on the,\n\n2:16:47.420 --> 2:16:50.780\n like, very practical, like, okay,\n\n2:16:50.780 --> 2:16:51.900\n how do we solve the problem?\n\n2:16:51.900 --> 2:16:52.780\n How do we escape?\n\n2:16:52.780 --> 2:16:56.900\n Let's solve, like, survival, food, shelter, focus.\n\n2:16:56.900 --> 2:16:58.760\n Remember that book,\n\n2:16:58.760 --> 2:17:01.000\n \"'All's Quiet on the Western Front,\" by World War I?\n\n2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:01.840\n There's this line in there.\n\n2:17:01.840 --> 2:17:02.680\n I forget what it is,\n\n2:17:02.680 --> 2:17:06.100\n about how war is like the smell of a skunk.\n\n2:17:06.100 --> 2:17:09.820\n Like a little bit is actually a little bit is slightly,\n\n2:17:10.900 --> 2:17:12.720\n there's something slightly delicious of it,\n\n2:17:12.720 --> 2:17:14.860\n is what it says in the book.\n\n2:17:14.860 --> 2:17:17.700\n I happen to like the smell of ferrets and skunks and things.\n\n2:17:17.700 --> 2:17:19.420\n I had a pet ferret when I was a kid,\n\n2:17:19.420 --> 2:17:21.900\n and I like that musky scent.\n\n2:17:21.900 --> 2:17:23.740\n Most people, just it's repulsive to them.\n\n2:17:23.740 --> 2:17:25.580\n It's actually a gene, believe it or not.\n\n2:17:25.580 --> 2:17:26.540\n Some people have the gene\n\n2:17:26.540 --> 2:17:29.340\n that makes the musky scent repulsive.\n\n2:17:29.340 --> 2:17:32.740\n Some people love it. Let me ask you this.\n\n2:17:32.740 --> 2:17:34.860\n There's another gene, this is a fun one.\n\n2:17:34.860 --> 2:17:37.260\n Microwave popcorn, smells good, neutral,\n\n2:17:37.260 --> 2:17:38.180\n or disgusting to you?\n\n2:17:38.180 --> 2:17:39.260\n Good, very good.\n\n2:17:39.260 --> 2:17:40.460\n There are people who have a gene\n\n2:17:40.460 --> 2:17:43.060\n that leads them to the perception\n\n2:17:43.060 --> 2:17:46.100\n that the smell of microwave popcorn that you find is good,\n\n2:17:46.100 --> 2:17:48.340\n it smells like putrid vomit to them.\n\n2:17:48.340 --> 2:17:51.140\n It's a particular gene variant,\n\n2:17:51.140 --> 2:17:52.520\n and they can smell certain elements\n\n2:17:52.520 --> 2:17:54.580\n within the microwave popcorn.\n\n2:17:55.660 --> 2:17:58.780\n It's pretty, it's prominent in France.\n\n2:17:58.780 --> 2:18:01.580\n This gene, and so in laboratories\n\n2:18:01.580 --> 2:18:04.300\n where you have a lot of French people,\n\n2:18:04.300 --> 2:18:05.620\n it's often said like you're not allowed\n\n2:18:05.620 --> 2:18:06.580\n to make microwave popcorn.\n\n2:18:06.580 --> 2:18:09.400\n It smells putrid, disgusting, you know?\n\n2:18:09.400 --> 2:18:12.860\n So a lot of it's in the perception of the beholder, right?\n\n2:18:14.580 --> 2:18:18.080\n But okay, before I leave the NSDR,\n\n2:18:18.080 --> 2:18:23.080\n focus in general, as you said, it's for shifting mind states.\n\n2:18:23.600 --> 2:18:28.140\n Is there advice you have for how to achieve focus\n\n2:18:28.140 --> 2:18:29.800\n on a task?\n\n2:18:29.800 --> 2:18:31.200\n Yes.\n\n2:18:31.200 --> 2:18:32.520\n First of all, we have to distinguish\n\n2:18:32.520 --> 2:18:34.780\n between modulators and mediators,\n\n2:18:34.780 --> 2:18:36.700\n and I'll do this very briefly.\n\n2:18:36.700 --> 2:18:37.580\n There are a lot of things\n\n2:18:37.580 --> 2:18:39.200\n that will modulate your state of focus,\n\n2:18:39.200 --> 2:18:42.140\n but they don't directly mediate your sense of focus.\n\n2:18:42.140 --> 2:18:44.960\n So for instance, if right now a fire alarm went off\n\n2:18:44.960 --> 2:18:48.060\n in this building, it would modulate our attention.\n\n2:18:48.060 --> 2:18:49.020\n We would get up and leave.\n\n2:18:49.020 --> 2:18:50.460\n It would be very hard to do what we're doing\n\n2:18:50.460 --> 2:18:53.220\n with that banging in the background, at least at first.\n\n2:18:53.220 --> 2:18:58.220\n So it's modulating focus, but it's not really involved\n\n2:18:58.300 --> 2:19:00.120\n in the mechanisms of focus, right?\n\n2:19:01.020 --> 2:19:04.440\n In the same way, being well rested when you sleep,\n\n2:19:04.440 --> 2:19:06.560\n your autonomic nervous system that adjusts states\n\n2:19:06.560 --> 2:19:09.100\n of alertness and focus and calm works better\n\n2:19:09.100 --> 2:19:10.560\n than when you're sleep deprived.\n\n2:19:10.560 --> 2:19:12.560\n So if you're sleeping better, you're gonna focus better.\n\n2:19:12.560 --> 2:19:15.740\n So I always answer this way to a question like this,\n\n2:19:15.740 --> 2:19:18.440\n because the best thing that anyone can do\n\n2:19:18.440 --> 2:19:20.640\n for their mental health, physical health, and performance\n\n2:19:20.640 --> 2:19:23.340\n in athletic or cognitive endeavors or creative endeavors\n\n2:19:23.340 --> 2:19:26.880\n is to make sure that you're getting enough quality sleep,\n\n2:19:26.880 --> 2:19:28.340\n enough of the time for you.\n\n2:19:28.340 --> 2:19:29.180\n And that's gonna differ.\n\n2:19:29.180 --> 2:19:30.380\n We could talk about what that means.\n\n2:19:30.380 --> 2:19:33.380\n Now, in terms of things that mediate focus\n\n2:19:33.380 --> 2:19:35.100\n without getting into the description of mechanisms,\n\n2:19:35.100 --> 2:19:36.800\n cause we have podcasts about that.\n\n2:19:37.980 --> 2:19:42.060\n It's very clear that mental focus follows visual focus,\n\n2:19:42.060 --> 2:19:44.020\n provided that you're a sighted person.\n\n2:19:45.180 --> 2:19:47.660\n Much of the training that's being done now in China\n\n2:19:47.660 --> 2:19:49.540\n to teach kids to focus better,\n\n2:19:49.540 --> 2:19:52.980\n literally has them stare at a target,\n\n2:19:52.980 --> 2:19:55.720\n blinking every so often, but really training themselves\n\n2:19:55.720 --> 2:19:59.480\n to breathe calmly and maintain a tight visual aperture.\n\n2:20:00.480 --> 2:20:02.200\n When you read, you have to maintain\n\n2:20:02.200 --> 2:20:03.220\n a tight visual aperture.\n\n2:20:03.220 --> 2:20:04.940\n You're literally scrolling like a highlighter\n\n2:20:04.940 --> 2:20:06.580\n in your mind's eye, right?\n\n2:20:06.580 --> 2:20:08.140\n It's kind of obvious once you hear it.\n\n2:20:08.140 --> 2:20:10.900\n So for people that have problems focusing sleep well,\n\n2:20:12.740 --> 2:20:17.020\n learn to dilate and contract your visual field consciously.\n\n2:20:17.020 --> 2:20:19.660\n This can be done if you practice it a little bit.\n\n2:20:19.660 --> 2:20:21.420\n And then as I said before,\n\n2:20:21.420 --> 2:20:23.340\n it is very hard to get into a state of focus,\n\n2:20:23.340 --> 2:20:26.020\n like a step function immediately, like snapping your fingers.\n\n2:20:26.020 --> 2:20:28.260\n What you can do is you can pick any object,\n\n2:20:28.260 --> 2:20:31.540\n but ideally an object at roughly the same distance,\n\n2:20:31.540 --> 2:20:32.920\n placed at roughly the same distance\n\n2:20:32.920 --> 2:20:35.820\n to which you're going to do that work and stare at it.\n\n2:20:35.820 --> 2:20:36.940\n You're allowed to blink.\n\n2:20:36.940 --> 2:20:39.460\n And as your mind starts to drift every once in a while\n\n2:20:39.460 --> 2:20:40.940\n to understand that's normal,\n\n2:20:40.940 --> 2:20:43.380\n but try and narrow your visual aperture\n\n2:20:43.380 --> 2:20:45.980\n and bring that into your visual field\n\n2:20:45.980 --> 2:20:47.420\n so that that's the most prominent thing,\n\n2:20:47.420 --> 2:20:49.300\n kind of like portrait mode in your phone.\n\n2:20:49.300 --> 2:20:51.000\n This would look very different in portrait mode\n\n2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:53.540\n than it would in just a standard photograph mode.\n\n2:20:53.540 --> 2:20:57.140\n And then after doing that for 30 to 60 seconds,\n\n2:20:57.140 --> 2:20:58.860\n moving into the work that you're about to do\n\n2:20:58.860 --> 2:21:01.280\n and really encourage yourself to do that.\n\n2:21:01.280 --> 2:21:03.500\n If you're somebody who's low vision or no vision,\n\n2:21:03.500 --> 2:21:05.160\n you're going to use your ears to do this.\n\n2:21:05.160 --> 2:21:08.380\n Braille readers have trouble focusing sometimes\n\n2:21:08.380 --> 2:21:11.660\n because they feel other stuff and they hear other stuff.\n\n2:21:11.660 --> 2:21:15.180\n So you learn to adjust that aperture consciously.\n\n2:21:15.180 --> 2:21:17.480\n And then of course the pharmacologic tools,\n\n2:21:17.480 --> 2:21:20.780\n just enough caffeine, but not too much, right?\n\n2:21:20.780 --> 2:21:22.460\n We talked about white noise, brown noise,\n\n2:21:22.460 --> 2:21:24.720\n music or no music, really varies,\n\n2:21:24.720 --> 2:21:28.860\n but it's very clear that binaural beats of 40 Hertz\n\n2:21:28.860 --> 2:21:31.320\n can shift the brain into a heightened state\n\n2:21:31.320 --> 2:21:32.600\n of focus and cognition.\n\n2:21:32.600 --> 2:21:34.060\n So if you're going to use binaural beats,\n\n2:21:34.060 --> 2:21:37.100\n which should definitely be used with headphones,\n\n2:21:37.100 --> 2:21:39.980\n and there are a number of free apps out there and sources,\n\n2:21:39.980 --> 2:21:43.220\n 40 Hertz seems to be the frequency\n\n2:21:43.220 --> 2:21:45.740\n that best supports the brain shifting\n\n2:21:45.740 --> 2:21:46.580\n into a particular mode of focus.\n\n2:21:46.580 --> 2:21:49.620\n Sorry, can you give us some binaural beats?\n\n2:21:49.620 --> 2:21:51.060\n Yeah, so you're going to look for,\n\n2:21:51.060 --> 2:21:54.920\n you'd want to find an app that offers 40 Hertz.\n\n2:21:54.920 --> 2:21:59.920\n I think Brainwave allows you to slide bar\n\n2:21:59.960 --> 2:22:02.460\n up to the particular frequency that you want.\n\n2:22:02.460 --> 2:22:05.220\n And I should say that there are other frequencies\n\n2:22:05.220 --> 2:22:07.980\n that are interesting, but 40 Hertz binaural beats\n\n2:22:07.980 --> 2:22:09.060\n seems to be the one\n\n2:22:09.060 --> 2:22:11.100\n that there's the most quality research on.\n\n2:22:11.100 --> 2:22:14.900\n So it's like a beat, but you're saying\n\n2:22:14.900 --> 2:22:16.300\n there's a lot of mixed science\n\n2:22:16.300 --> 2:22:19.340\n on the white noise and brown noise.\n\n2:22:19.340 --> 2:22:21.500\n You really should be doing this with headphones\n\n2:22:21.500 --> 2:22:23.140\n because binaural beats are best accomplished\n\n2:22:23.140 --> 2:22:26.020\n by feeding two different frequencies to the two ears.\n\n2:22:26.020 --> 2:22:28.180\n And then you have what's called this brainstem area\n\n2:22:28.180 --> 2:22:30.240\n that reads out what are called interaural time differences.\n\n2:22:30.240 --> 2:22:33.100\n And then it extracts the delta essentially.\n\n2:22:33.100 --> 2:22:33.940\n Turn it up.\n\n2:22:33.940 --> 2:22:38.940\n And then in other things that can enhance focus.\n\n2:22:41.240 --> 2:22:43.280\n So, you know, the pharmacology around this\n\n2:22:43.280 --> 2:22:44.120\n is pretty interesting.\n\n2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:45.600\n Things that tickle the dopamine pathway\n\n2:22:45.600 --> 2:22:47.540\n and the acetylcholine pathway, they work.\n\n2:22:47.540 --> 2:22:48.680\n Yeah.\n\n2:22:48.680 --> 2:22:50.080\n There's your Ritalin, your Adderals,\n\n2:22:50.080 --> 2:22:51.840\n your Modafinils, which are prescription.\n\n2:22:51.840 --> 2:22:54.120\n And there's a lot of non prescription use\n\n2:22:54.120 --> 2:22:55.680\n of those prescription drugs.\n\n2:22:55.680 --> 2:22:57.400\n Not so much in my generation,\n\n2:22:57.400 --> 2:23:00.600\n but in people 35 and younger, you know,\n\n2:23:00.600 --> 2:23:02.420\n I hear all the time from day traders\n\n2:23:02.420 --> 2:23:04.720\n and programmers and stuff and kids that play video games,\n\n2:23:04.720 --> 2:23:07.000\n a lot of Ritalin Adderall use.\n\n2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:08.920\n I think that unless it's prescribed by a doctor\n\n2:23:08.920 --> 2:23:10.820\n for a specific purpose of ADHD,\n\n2:23:10.820 --> 2:23:12.960\n I don't think people should go that route, frankly.\n\n2:23:12.960 --> 2:23:15.000\n Hits the dopamine system way too hard.\n\n2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:19.600\n Also has a number of negative effects on sexual side effects,\n\n2:23:19.600 --> 2:23:21.520\n all sorts of things that you just wouldn't want.\n\n2:23:21.520 --> 2:23:25.000\n There are a few compounds like alpha GPC,\n\n2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:27.760\n 300 milligrams to 600 milligrams of alpha GPC\n\n2:23:27.760 --> 2:23:28.960\n with a cup of espresso.\n\n2:23:28.960 --> 2:23:32.720\n If you're well rested, you're like a laser for 90 minutes,\n\n2:23:32.720 --> 2:23:35.240\n maybe two hours, but then it's going to taper off\n\n2:23:35.240 --> 2:23:37.080\n and you have to just recognize that.\n\n2:23:37.080 --> 2:23:39.800\n And then there's this whole world of nootropics now\n\n2:23:39.800 --> 2:23:42.280\n and people trying to figure out the racetams,\n\n2:23:42.280 --> 2:23:45.560\n paracetams and phenol ethylamine combined with this.\n\n2:23:45.560 --> 2:23:47.200\n And, you know, it's not quite in the place\n\n2:23:47.200 --> 2:23:48.360\n where you'd like it to be.\n\n2:23:48.360 --> 2:23:49.200\n There are a few companies\n\n2:23:49.200 --> 2:23:50.480\n that are doing this better than others.\n\n2:23:50.480 --> 2:23:51.960\n We talk about some of these on the podcast,\n\n2:23:51.960 --> 2:23:55.240\n but I would always start with behavioral tools\n\n2:23:55.240 --> 2:23:57.400\n and then consider pharmacology.\n\n2:23:57.400 --> 2:24:00.600\n And then I suppose the other thing for focus\n\n2:24:00.600 --> 2:24:03.120\n is there are these, this is a little more esoteric,\n\n2:24:03.120 --> 2:24:06.240\n but we cover this in an episode on workplace optimization.\n\n2:24:07.100 --> 2:24:09.960\n Where you place your screen is important.\n\n2:24:09.960 --> 2:24:12.840\n Staring down at a screen is not going to be as effective\n\n2:24:12.840 --> 2:24:15.120\n as placing it at eye level or above you.\n\n2:24:15.120 --> 2:24:16.200\n When the eyes are up,\n\n2:24:16.200 --> 2:24:18.660\n literally when your eyes are directed forward or up,\n\n2:24:18.660 --> 2:24:21.040\n the brainstem centers for alertness are activated.\n\n2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:24.200\n When your eyes are down, it's actually you're sort of,\n\n2:24:24.200 --> 2:24:25.880\n it's like being pulled under water a little bit\n\n2:24:25.880 --> 2:24:27.760\n in the autonomic arousal sense.\n\n2:24:27.760 --> 2:24:32.480\n It's your closing your eyes is one,\n\n2:24:32.480 --> 2:24:34.440\n it reflects the brainstem centers\n\n2:24:34.440 --> 2:24:36.200\n that are active becoming less,\n\n2:24:36.200 --> 2:24:39.840\n or for alertness, excuse me, becoming less active.\n\n2:24:39.840 --> 2:24:41.020\n But there's a really cool effect\n\n2:24:41.020 --> 2:24:42.560\n that's active in this room right now,\n\n2:24:42.560 --> 2:24:45.280\n which is that there've been some really interesting studies\n\n2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:48.160\n that when people work in small compact spaces\n\n2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:49.760\n or wear a hoodie or a hat,\n\n2:24:49.760 --> 2:24:53.320\n that can also improve focus like blinders on a horse\n\n2:24:53.320 --> 2:24:55.640\n for obvious reasons now, based on what I said before,\n\n2:24:55.640 --> 2:24:59.640\n but also analytic work or the kind of work\n\n2:24:59.640 --> 2:25:02.240\n where there's a correct answer that you're seeking\n\n2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:05.460\n is best supported by these kind of low ceiling environments.\n\n2:25:05.460 --> 2:25:07.920\n Whereas there's something called the cathedral effect,\n\n2:25:07.920 --> 2:25:09.800\n which is when you work in an outdoor environment\n\n2:25:09.800 --> 2:25:11.140\n or a high ceiling environment,\n\n2:25:11.140 --> 2:25:14.640\n it lends itself to kind of pun intended,\n\n2:25:14.640 --> 2:25:17.600\n kind of loftier ideas and more creativity.\n\n2:25:17.600 --> 2:25:19.160\n And that probably has to do with the fact\n\n2:25:19.160 --> 2:25:21.280\n that there's a natural tendency, a reflex\n\n2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:23.220\n to expand your visual field\n\n2:25:23.220 --> 2:25:25.660\n in these high ceiling environments.\n\n2:25:25.660 --> 2:25:28.480\n Expansion of the visual field\n\n2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:31.820\n changes the way the brain works in the time domain.\n\n2:25:31.820 --> 2:25:35.100\n Your engineering and biology oriented listeners\n\n2:25:35.100 --> 2:25:37.700\n will understand this and music.\n\n2:25:37.700 --> 2:25:39.940\n For those that don't, the best way to think about it\n\n2:25:39.940 --> 2:25:42.800\n is when you have a narrow focus portrait mode on your phone\n\n2:25:42.800 --> 2:25:47.540\n or you're very alert, you are fine slicing life in time.\n\n2:25:47.540 --> 2:25:50.680\n It's like a, think of it as a high frame rate,\n\n2:25:50.680 --> 2:25:52.760\n like you're shooting in slow motion.\n\n2:25:52.760 --> 2:25:56.000\n When you have a, when you dilate your view,\n\n2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:58.000\n you're taking bigger time bins.\n\n2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:01.000\n And that one way to just let this hopefully land home\n\n2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:04.560\n is that if you've ever had a really exciting day\n\n2:26:04.560 --> 2:26:08.280\n or podcast interview or experience of any kind,\n\n2:26:08.280 --> 2:26:11.500\n your system is flooded with dopamine and norepinephrine,\n\n2:26:11.500 --> 2:26:13.800\n alertness and motivation, all this excitement.\n\n2:26:13.800 --> 2:26:15.880\n It seems like it goes by very, very fast.\n\n2:26:15.880 --> 2:26:17.560\n And yet when you think back to that,\n\n2:26:17.560 --> 2:26:19.840\n it seems like a lot happened.\n\n2:26:19.840 --> 2:26:20.840\n This happened and that happened.\n\n2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:23.160\n Now think about waiting in the doctor's office\n\n2:26:23.160 --> 2:26:24.440\n in a blank waiting room\n\n2:26:24.440 --> 2:26:26.720\n with no interesting art on the walls.\n\n2:26:26.720 --> 2:26:29.040\n It feels like it goes by very, very slow.\n\n2:26:29.040 --> 2:26:31.840\n Dopamine and norepinephrine are at all time low.\n\n2:26:31.840 --> 2:26:33.920\n And yet when you think back on that experience,\n\n2:26:33.920 --> 2:26:35.400\n it's as if nothing happened\n\n2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:39.240\n because you were parsing time differently.\n\n2:26:39.240 --> 2:26:41.240\n So those are the roughly the tools\n\n2:26:41.240 --> 2:26:43.720\n and the neurochemicals around time perception\n\n2:26:43.720 --> 2:26:44.920\n and the time domain.\n\n2:26:44.920 --> 2:26:46.760\n There's a wonderful book, I'm forgetting the title,\n\n2:26:46.760 --> 2:26:48.200\n so wonderful I forget the title,\n\n2:26:48.200 --> 2:26:50.960\n by Dean Bodo Mano from UCLA,\n\n2:26:50.960 --> 2:26:53.480\n but I think it's called The Brain is a Time Machine\n\n2:26:53.480 --> 2:26:56.120\n that talks about this expansion and contraction\n\n2:26:56.120 --> 2:26:58.280\n of the time domain and what you can do\n\n2:26:58.280 --> 2:27:01.040\n to leverage it for work and creativity focus and so on.\n\n2:27:01.040 --> 2:27:03.760\n Yeah, it's fascinating that I think one way\n\n2:27:03.760 --> 2:27:07.720\n to define focus for me is the experience,\n\n2:27:07.720 --> 2:27:11.520\n the feeling of focus is losing track of time,\n\n2:27:11.520 --> 2:27:13.860\n is getting to a place where you're no longer\n\n2:27:15.720 --> 2:27:17.960\n operating in time.\n\n2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:21.960\n Well, and you mentioned being kind of cramming for something\n\n2:27:21.960 --> 2:27:24.120\n where you'll release a lot of adrenaline.\n\n2:27:24.120 --> 2:27:27.660\n And it is true, you can get a lot done under pressure\n\n2:27:27.660 --> 2:27:29.960\n because of the way that you're slicing time.\n\n2:27:29.960 --> 2:27:32.040\n You don't actually have more time.\n\n2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:34.020\n It's that you're finally in a brain state\n\n2:27:34.020 --> 2:27:37.480\n that lends itself well to parsing information really quickly.\n\n2:27:37.480 --> 2:27:40.100\n Now, if we ramp up your level of stress enough,\n\n2:27:40.100 --> 2:27:44.400\n it's definitely, it's a more or less normal distribution.\n\n2:27:44.400 --> 2:27:45.440\n We get you stressed enough,\n\n2:27:45.440 --> 2:27:46.480\n it's hard to remember anything,\n\n2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:47.560\n you're not parsing time well.\n\n2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:50.160\n But in that middle range, almost every study shows\n\n2:27:50.160 --> 2:27:51.840\n that the higher levels of autonomic arousal,\n\n2:27:51.840 --> 2:27:54.720\n meaning norepinephrine, adrenaline in your system,\n\n2:27:54.720 --> 2:27:57.560\n the more effective you are at things.\n\n2:27:57.560 --> 2:27:59.700\n And we always hear stress and adrenaline,\n\n2:27:59.700 --> 2:28:00.760\n it's just bad, bad, bad.\n\n2:28:00.760 --> 2:28:02.520\n But my colleague, Ali Krom at Stanford\n\n2:28:02.520 --> 2:28:03.720\n has done these beautiful studies\n\n2:28:03.720 --> 2:28:05.880\n where if you just educate people\n\n2:28:05.880 --> 2:28:10.060\n on how adrenaline makes them sharper thinkers,\n\n2:28:10.060 --> 2:28:11.440\n they become sharper thinkers.\n\n2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:13.240\n If you educate them on the fact that stress\n\n2:28:13.240 --> 2:28:16.680\n makes your cognition worse, their cognition gets worse.\n\n2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:18.280\n This is why I don't wear a sleep tracker.\n\n2:28:18.280 --> 2:28:19.720\n If you tell people they slept poorly,\n\n2:28:19.720 --> 2:28:21.360\n your recovery score sucks,\n\n2:28:21.360 --> 2:28:23.880\n they naturally perform less well the next day\n\n2:28:23.880 --> 2:28:26.680\n than if you tell them your recovery score is high.\n\n2:28:26.680 --> 2:28:28.720\n And so I don't have anything against those companies,\n\n2:28:28.720 --> 2:28:31.440\n but in fact, we use some of their technology,\n\n2:28:31.440 --> 2:28:33.000\n can be very useful in certain contexts,\n\n2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:37.760\n but you want to determine your mindset around these things.\n\n2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:38.600\n And if you tell yourself,\n\n2:28:38.600 --> 2:28:41.880\n hey, deadlines make me sharp, pressure makes me sharp,\n\n2:28:41.880 --> 2:28:43.400\n you will perform better.\n\n2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:48.400\n So stress and anxiety, what is that?\n\n2:28:48.540 --> 2:28:51.180\n And can it be leveraged for good?\n\n2:28:51.180 --> 2:28:55.000\n Absolutely, look, whether or not you get into a cold ice bath\n\n2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:58.040\n or a hot sauna so hot you want to get out,\n\n2:28:58.040 --> 2:29:02.600\n or you get hit square in the face with something over text\n\n2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:06.680\n that you really didn't want to hear or see, it's adrenaline.\n\n2:29:06.680 --> 2:29:07.800\n It's just adrenaline.\n\n2:29:07.800 --> 2:29:09.680\n And so your subjective readout of that\n\n2:29:09.680 --> 2:29:11.600\n and what it means is really important.\n\n2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:13.040\n And you can just channel that.\n\n2:29:13.040 --> 2:29:17.120\n Well, you can, if you agree with the following statement,\n\n2:29:17.120 --> 2:29:20.040\n which I do, and many people do because the data support it,\n\n2:29:20.040 --> 2:29:22.320\n which is Allie Crum's statement, not mine,\n\n2:29:22.320 --> 2:29:24.760\n which is she directs the mind body lab at Stanford.\n\n2:29:24.760 --> 2:29:27.280\n She's brilliant, by the way, brilliant Harvard trained,\n\n2:29:27.280 --> 2:29:30.280\n Yale trained, trained licensed clinical psychologist,\n\n2:29:30.280 --> 2:29:31.520\n also a tenured professor at Stanford.\n\n2:29:31.520 --> 2:29:34.920\n She's a Olympian, no, excuse me,\n\n2:29:34.920 --> 2:29:39.500\n a division one athlete in gymnastics and martial arts.\n\n2:29:39.500 --> 2:29:42.320\n And her dad is a long time martial arts trainer,\n\n2:29:42.320 --> 2:29:43.600\n who's done work with special forces\n\n2:29:43.600 --> 2:29:45.680\n and he's an amazing human being and very humble,\n\n2:29:45.680 --> 2:29:50.320\n very kind, lovely woman and professor scientist.\n\n2:29:50.320 --> 2:29:53.320\n She says, anything that you do and experience,\n\n2:29:53.320 --> 2:29:58.320\n but especially stress is the consequence of that thing\n\n2:29:58.360 --> 2:30:01.040\n and what you believe about that thing.\n\n2:30:01.040 --> 2:30:04.160\n And so if you consume a lot of information\n\n2:30:04.160 --> 2:30:07.720\n about the powers of stressful states to bring out your best,\n\n2:30:07.720 --> 2:30:09.160\n you will perform better.\n\n2:30:09.160 --> 2:30:10.640\n If you consume a lot of information\n\n2:30:10.640 --> 2:30:13.120\n about the power of stress to cripple you,\n\n2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:15.240\n you will perform worse.\n\n2:30:15.240 --> 2:30:18.460\n There's absolutely no question, the data are striking.\n\n2:30:18.460 --> 2:30:20.500\n And this is not growth mindset.\n\n2:30:20.500 --> 2:30:24.140\n This is just simply what do you believe about stress\n\n2:30:24.140 --> 2:30:27.800\n based on the dominant knowledge\n\n2:30:27.800 --> 2:30:28.920\n that you're consuming about it.\n\n2:30:28.920 --> 2:30:31.640\n So that's why it's fun to watch David Goggins,\n\n2:30:31.640 --> 2:30:35.060\n here we go again, David or Jocko or Joe or someone put,\n\n2:30:35.060 --> 2:30:37.680\n or Cam Haynes put out this information about,\n\n2:30:37.680 --> 2:30:39.580\n or Ryan Hall who ran for Stanford\n\n2:30:39.580 --> 2:30:41.480\n and then now is like into the power lifting thing\n\n2:30:41.480 --> 2:30:42.320\n and running.\n\n2:30:43.280 --> 2:30:45.040\n And there are others too, of course.\n\n2:30:45.040 --> 2:30:48.320\n When you start to consume a lot of that information,\n\n2:30:48.320 --> 2:30:49.560\n it's not just inspiring,\n\n2:30:49.560 --> 2:30:51.580\n it actually changes your perception\n\n2:30:51.580 --> 2:30:53.740\n of what your own stressful states mean.\n\n2:30:54.940 --> 2:30:56.880\n You can actually get better from stress\n\n2:30:56.880 --> 2:31:00.980\n if you're in the ocean of knowledge that stress grows you.\n\n2:31:00.980 --> 2:31:03.800\n If you're living in the ocean of knowledge,\n\n2:31:03.800 --> 2:31:05.560\n I was seeing like a pool in the summer,\n\n2:31:05.560 --> 2:31:06.600\n you got the kiddie pool,\n\n2:31:06.600 --> 2:31:08.800\n the kids all peeing in it, presumably.\n\n2:31:08.800 --> 2:31:09.640\n And you got the diving thing,\n\n2:31:09.640 --> 2:31:10.640\n you got the high dive and all that.\n\n2:31:10.640 --> 2:31:13.960\n If you believe that the experience of belly flopping\n\n2:31:13.960 --> 2:31:17.080\n off the high dive is gonna make you a better diver,\n\n2:31:17.080 --> 2:31:20.640\n in some sense, at least in this analogy, it will.\n\n2:31:20.640 --> 2:31:22.960\n Whereas if you feel that it's just the most embarrassing\n\n2:31:22.960 --> 2:31:25.480\n thing ever, and it's gonna cripple your ability\n\n2:31:25.480 --> 2:31:28.780\n to get out in the dive in front of anybody ever again,\n\n2:31:28.780 --> 2:31:31.160\n well, you're right about that too.\n\n2:31:31.160 --> 2:31:34.200\n Yeah, we actually talked with Carl about depression,\n\n2:31:34.200 --> 2:31:37.440\n all those kinds of things that there could be\n\n2:31:37.440 --> 2:31:41.600\n these, what are commonly seen as negative journeys,\n\n2:31:41.600 --> 2:31:46.040\n they could be, when reframed, can be used.\n\n2:31:46.040 --> 2:31:48.160\n You know, one of the reasons I enjoy our friendship so much\n\n2:31:48.160 --> 2:31:50.480\n is that you bring this Russian thing,\n\n2:31:50.480 --> 2:31:52.840\n which I don't really understand it at a deep level,\n\n2:31:52.840 --> 2:31:53.960\n how could I, I'm not Russian,\n\n2:31:53.960 --> 2:31:58.680\n but this mindset like that there's pain in life.\n\n2:31:58.680 --> 2:32:02.200\n When I watched that Hedgehog in the Fog cartoon,\n\n2:32:02.200 --> 2:32:05.100\n I thought, no wonder Russians call it the way they do.\n\n2:32:05.100 --> 2:32:06.840\n This is the most, it's so sad,\n\n2:32:06.840 --> 2:32:08.760\n it's beautiful in Sabbath, it's so sad.\n\n2:32:08.760 --> 2:32:11.080\n Whereas out here, it's like Sesame Street,\n\n2:32:11.080 --> 2:32:13.920\n and my mother would not let me watch Sesame Street\n\n2:32:13.920 --> 2:32:15.000\n when I was a kid.\n\n2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:17.080\n She thought it was too chaotic.\n\n2:32:17.080 --> 2:32:18.320\n Too chaotic. Too chaotic.\n\n2:32:18.320 --> 2:32:19.680\n She was like, it's too chaotic.\n\n2:32:19.680 --> 2:32:20.520\n Too many things going on.\n\n2:32:20.520 --> 2:32:22.160\n Captain Kangaroo, we were allowed,\n\n2:32:22.160 --> 2:32:24.280\n and then Mr. Rogers, we were allowed.\n\n2:32:24.280 --> 2:32:25.420\n I never really liked shows,\n\n2:32:25.420 --> 2:32:28.340\n I liked doing things outside in the yard.\n\n2:32:29.360 --> 2:32:30.680\n I was trying to trap all the animals,\n\n2:32:30.680 --> 2:32:32.080\n I didn't wanna watch stuff on TV.\n\n2:32:32.080 --> 2:32:35.440\n But Hedgehog in the Fog is enough to turn any kid\n\n2:32:35.440 --> 2:32:38.840\n into a thinker and a philosopher and a poet.\n\n2:32:38.840 --> 2:32:40.280\n Here we go.\n\n2:32:40.280 --> 2:32:42.240\n I fell in love with this when you showed,\n\n2:32:42.240 --> 2:32:44.520\n look, it even walks with its arms behind its back.\n\n2:32:44.520 --> 2:32:45.800\n So for people who don't know,\n\n2:32:45.800 --> 2:32:48.820\n and we're watching little clips here to get into,\n\n2:32:48.820 --> 2:32:53.820\n and it's a hedgehog that is wandering about\n\n2:32:54.200 --> 2:32:57.800\n in this fog at night, and.\n\n2:32:57.800 --> 2:32:59.340\n Can't even see a lamp.\n\n2:32:59.340 --> 2:33:00.880\n The fog is so dense.\n\n2:33:00.880 --> 2:33:03.400\n There's a feeling of searching.\n\n2:33:03.400 --> 2:33:08.160\n And then there's a horse that speaks from a distance.\n\n2:33:08.160 --> 2:33:09.080\n Words of wisdom.\n\n2:33:09.080 --> 2:33:12.560\n Some people actually told me that they believe that's God.\n\n2:33:12.560 --> 2:33:15.040\n That's supposed to represent God.\n\n2:33:15.040 --> 2:33:18.840\n I always thought it was a motherly voice, or a voice.\n\n2:33:18.840 --> 2:33:23.160\n A voice of conformity that wants you to return to safety.\n\n2:33:23.160 --> 2:33:27.120\n And here's the hedgehog is searching\n\n2:33:27.120 --> 2:33:31.020\n for something that's in him for the unknown,\n\n2:33:31.020 --> 2:33:32.800\n to explore the unknown.\n\n2:33:32.800 --> 2:33:37.800\n And ultimately, as it, as the cartoon unrolls,\n\n2:33:38.520 --> 2:33:43.440\n it's, he discovers a friend in a bear.\n\n2:33:43.440 --> 2:33:46.120\n And he also discovers a lifetime passion\n\n2:33:46.120 --> 2:33:47.800\n for looking up at the stars,\n\n2:33:47.800 --> 2:33:50.760\n and the curiosity of exploring what is up there.\n\n2:33:50.760 --> 2:33:55.420\n And I see that as science, as exploring the mystery.\n\n2:33:55.420 --> 2:33:59.040\n And also I see that as brave to explore the mystery\n\n2:33:59.040 --> 2:34:01.840\n given all the uncertainty all around you.\n\n2:34:01.840 --> 2:34:04.480\n But there is a melancholy, the whole sound of it,\n\n2:34:04.480 --> 2:34:06.320\n the feel of it, the look of it.\n\n2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:11.320\n It was, it just captures both the melancholy\n\n2:34:12.120 --> 2:34:14.640\n and the wonder of childhood.\n\n2:34:14.640 --> 2:34:17.680\n Which is like, there's a loneliness to it.\n\n2:34:17.680 --> 2:34:19.720\n Like, nobody understands me.\n\n2:34:21.800 --> 2:34:25.720\n That's there, that children can feel.\n\n2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:27.120\n Because you're trying to figure out.\n\n2:34:27.120 --> 2:34:28.560\n That's my favorite character right there.\n\n2:34:28.560 --> 2:34:29.560\n I love the owl.\n\n2:34:29.560 --> 2:34:30.960\n I love the owl.\n\n2:34:30.960 --> 2:34:32.200\n The owl shows up every once in a while.\n\n2:34:32.200 --> 2:34:33.040\n I love the owl.\n\n2:34:33.040 --> 2:34:35.160\n Sorry, I interrupted you.\n\n2:34:35.160 --> 2:34:36.000\n Again.\n\n2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:37.060\n There's non sequitur.\n\n2:34:37.060 --> 2:34:39.520\n It means you're interested 70% of the time.\n\n2:34:39.520 --> 2:34:41.720\n The other 30%, you're just an asshole.\n\n2:34:41.720 --> 2:34:43.080\n So you have to figure out which.\n\n2:34:43.080 --> 2:34:44.000\n So I'm told.\n\n2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:47.480\n There's non sequitur parts in this cartoon.\n\n2:34:47.480 --> 2:34:49.940\n It's voted as one of the greatest cartoons of all time.\n\n2:34:49.940 --> 2:34:52.800\n Short, short little films, documentary filmmakers.\n\n2:34:52.800 --> 2:34:56.440\n So it is, you know, in the Soviet Union,\n\n2:34:56.440 --> 2:35:01.240\n in a lot of sort of authoritarian regimes,\n\n2:35:02.120 --> 2:35:07.120\n there's channels to communicate difficult ideas to people.\n\n2:35:07.120 --> 2:35:08.480\n And you figure out those channels.\n\n2:35:08.480 --> 2:35:09.840\n And in the Soviet Union,\n\n2:35:09.840 --> 2:35:13.480\n one of those channels was children's cartoons.\n\n2:35:13.480 --> 2:35:16.360\n So you're actually, they're very much for adults.\n\n2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:19.600\n Yeah, I like that in some countries,\n\n2:35:19.600 --> 2:35:21.000\n not so much in the US,\n\n2:35:22.300 --> 2:35:24.440\n children are treated with more respect\n\n2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:27.480\n for their intelligence, you know,\n\n2:35:27.480 --> 2:35:29.840\n and not constantly getting this drivel\n\n2:35:29.840 --> 2:35:34.040\n of just kind of moronic explosions and whistles and bells\n\n2:35:34.040 --> 2:35:37.260\n and the voices that just kind of, you know,\n\n2:35:37.260 --> 2:35:39.680\n children, obviously are children and need to be,\n\n2:35:39.680 --> 2:35:41.200\n their brains are young and plastic\n\n2:35:41.200 --> 2:35:45.220\n and need to be treated and nurtured as such.\n\n2:35:45.220 --> 2:35:48.600\n But they have an intelligence.\n\n2:35:48.600 --> 2:35:51.600\n And I think that you treat them like morons\n\n2:35:51.600 --> 2:35:53.840\n and they're gonna behave like morons.\n\n2:35:53.840 --> 2:35:55.120\n You treat them as, you know,\n\n2:35:55.120 --> 2:35:58.560\n people who can consume information\n\n2:35:58.560 --> 2:36:00.680\n and make sense of it in their own way.\n\n2:36:00.680 --> 2:36:02.560\n And that's what they're gonna do.\n\n2:36:02.560 --> 2:36:05.280\n They have a seriousness of looking at the world.\n\n2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:10.080\n I love people that talk with children like they're adults.\n\n2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:13.640\n Well, like, here's if you're talking to a mini Einstein,\n\n2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:15.980\n because you're like really,\n\n2:36:15.980 --> 2:36:17.880\n they're asking some big questions.\n\n2:36:17.880 --> 2:36:19.880\n And I think, I mean, people sometimes\n\n2:36:19.880 --> 2:36:23.240\n speak of me in this way.\n\n2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:26.200\n Like, how dumb is this childlike person?\n\n2:36:26.200 --> 2:36:28.280\n But like, no, there's intelligence\n\n2:36:28.280 --> 2:36:32.320\n in these dumb, simple questions that a child asks.\n\n2:36:32.320 --> 2:36:35.440\n And I always love those questions, the simplicity,\n\n2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:39.460\n but also the depth of those questions.\n\n2:36:39.460 --> 2:36:40.300\n Why?\n\n2:36:40.300 --> 2:36:41.920\n The reason I started watching your podcast\n\n2:36:41.920 --> 2:36:44.720\n was you did an episode early on with Ray Dalio.\n\n2:36:44.720 --> 2:36:45.560\n Yeah.\n\n2:36:45.560 --> 2:36:47.860\n And the first, maybe the first,\n\n2:36:47.860 --> 2:36:50.000\n but a question that you definitely asked him\n\n2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:53.320\n was you just said, what is money?\n\n2:36:53.320 --> 2:36:55.040\n And his answer was fantastic.\n\n2:36:55.040 --> 2:36:58.800\n It's a superb question and he gave a superb answer.\n\n2:36:58.800 --> 2:37:02.520\n And I never would have thought to ask that question.\n\n2:37:02.520 --> 2:37:04.160\n And it's the question.\n\n2:37:04.160 --> 2:37:06.460\n And it was the question to tee things off with.\n\n2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:10.840\n So simple questions that get right\n\n2:37:10.840 --> 2:37:12.960\n to the heart of the matter, you know,\n\n2:37:12.960 --> 2:37:17.060\n and kids aren't often putting the same cultural filters\n\n2:37:17.060 --> 2:37:21.440\n and you know, kids generally aren't concerned\n\n2:37:21.440 --> 2:37:23.680\n about getting canceled either.\n\n2:37:23.680 --> 2:37:25.160\n So they'll ask the question\n\n2:37:25.160 --> 2:37:26.400\n that no one else is willing to ask.\n\n2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:27.840\n And they're not concerned about\n\n2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:30.640\n how dumb the question sounds.\n\n2:37:30.640 --> 2:37:32.160\n I find the most fascinating questions\n\n2:37:32.160 --> 2:37:33.920\n are just really, really simple.\n\n2:37:33.920 --> 2:37:37.820\n And it is a bit embarrassing to ask those simple questions\n\n2:37:37.820 --> 2:37:40.480\n of like, what is anything?\n\n2:37:40.480 --> 2:37:43.800\n You're asking them for all of us, so please ask them.\n\n2:37:43.800 --> 2:37:46.800\n I think that question, what is money, is crucial.\n\n2:37:46.800 --> 2:37:49.960\n And I think the simple questions are the most,\n\n2:37:49.960 --> 2:37:51.120\n obviously the most interesting.\n\n2:37:51.120 --> 2:37:53.520\n I'm gonna ask you about, you had awesome podcasts.\n\n2:37:53.520 --> 2:37:55.280\n I mean, I can ask you questions about basically\n\n2:37:55.280 --> 2:37:56.120\n all your podcasts.\n\n2:37:56.120 --> 2:37:57.480\n People should definitely listen to the Huberman Lab,\n\n2:37:57.480 --> 2:38:00.960\n but with Andy Gap and the conversation,\n\n2:38:00.960 --> 2:38:02.680\n you talked about strength and muscle building\n\n2:38:02.680 --> 2:38:03.600\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:38:03.600 --> 2:38:04.800\n He's an encyclopedia.\n\n2:38:04.800 --> 2:38:05.640\n Yeah.\n\n2:38:05.640 --> 2:38:08.420\n And he also works with a lot of UFC fighters\n\n2:38:08.420 --> 2:38:11.720\n and he works with, he has a lab that includes a gym.\n\n2:38:11.720 --> 2:38:14.520\n And so he works on endurance and powerlifting\n\n2:38:14.520 --> 2:38:16.380\n and also hypertrophy training, et cetera.\n\n2:38:16.380 --> 2:38:19.160\n But he also does muscle biopsy.\n\n2:38:19.160 --> 2:38:21.360\n So he runs the full spectrum\n\n2:38:21.360 --> 2:38:23.800\n and he's a full tenured professor\n\n2:38:23.800 --> 2:38:25.680\n and he does all this stuff.\n\n2:38:25.680 --> 2:38:29.080\n So he's a really unique person\n\n2:38:29.080 --> 2:38:31.120\n in this whole fitness landscape\n\n2:38:31.120 --> 2:38:33.000\n because there are a lot of PTs out there.\n\n2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:34.480\n There are a lot of kinesiologists.\n\n2:38:34.480 --> 2:38:36.640\n There are a lot of people studying nutrition\n\n2:38:36.640 --> 2:38:37.480\n and sports training.\n\n2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:40.280\n But I think he has the, among the people out there,\n\n2:38:40.280 --> 2:38:42.720\n he's at least in the top five,\n\n2:38:42.720 --> 2:38:45.160\n probably within the top three of people\n\n2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:47.920\n that really have their arms around the full extent\n\n2:38:47.920 --> 2:38:50.600\n of what's possible with training.\n\n2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:53.480\n And he works with the UFC Performance Center.\n\n2:38:53.480 --> 2:38:55.640\n Well, I mean, he just said a very systematic way\n\n2:38:55.640 --> 2:38:58.000\n of describing things that was really nice.\n\n2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:02.080\n You know, skill, speed, power, strength,\n\n2:39:02.080 --> 2:39:05.400\n hypertrophy, so muscle mass, right?\n\n2:39:05.400 --> 2:39:06.640\n Endurance, all kinds of,\n\n2:39:06.640 --> 2:39:08.920\n and then the philosophical of like adaptation,\n\n2:39:08.920 --> 2:39:11.000\n how to overload stuff, all that very,\n\n2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:14.660\n is there stuff, I'll ask you about ice bath and sauna,\n\n2:39:14.660 --> 2:39:16.680\n which was surprising to me there.\n\n2:39:16.680 --> 2:39:20.260\n Is there stuff you took away from that conversation,\n\n2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:25.960\n like principles about how to get strong,\n\n2:39:25.960 --> 2:39:28.080\n how to build muscle mass,\n\n2:39:28.080 --> 2:39:31.320\n that like broadened and deepened your understanding\n\n2:39:31.320 --> 2:39:32.400\n of that task?\n\n2:39:32.400 --> 2:39:33.240\n Definitely.\n\n2:39:33.240 --> 2:39:34.320\n And I'll do these in bullet points\n\n2:39:34.320 --> 2:39:36.160\n because if people want the logic behind them\n\n2:39:36.160 --> 2:39:38.000\n and the mechanism, they can listen to that episode.\n\n2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:39.240\n It's a really good episode.\n\n2:39:39.240 --> 2:39:40.840\n I'll start with heat and cold really quickly\n\n2:39:40.840 --> 2:39:44.060\n and just say that avoid cold immersion.\n\n2:39:44.060 --> 2:39:47.800\n So ice baths and being in cold water up to the neck,\n\n2:39:47.800 --> 2:39:50.180\n uncomfortably cold within the four hours\n\n2:39:50.180 --> 2:39:53.800\n after a training session that's designed\n\n2:39:53.800 --> 2:39:55.080\n to evoke an adaptation,\n\n2:39:55.080 --> 2:39:57.500\n either endurance, hypertrophy, or strength,\n\n2:39:57.500 --> 2:39:59.920\n because the inflammation that you experienced\n\n2:39:59.920 --> 2:40:02.400\n from a hard endurance workout or from a hard strength\n\n2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:05.640\n or a hard hypertrophy workout is the stimulus\n\n2:40:05.640 --> 2:40:07.200\n that you're going to adapt to.\n\n2:40:07.200 --> 2:40:10.120\n The cold water immersion reduces inflammation\n\n2:40:10.120 --> 2:40:12.880\n and can short circuit some of that.\n\n2:40:12.880 --> 2:40:14.600\n After four hours, you're probably okay,\n\n2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:16.280\n but if you can do it a different day\n\n2:40:16.280 --> 2:40:18.840\n or you can do it before those sessions, that's better.\n\n2:40:18.840 --> 2:40:21.920\n Heat, however, can be done immediately after training\n\n2:40:21.920 --> 2:40:22.880\n and it's probably beneficial\n\n2:40:22.880 --> 2:40:25.280\n because of the way that it dilates the vascular system\n\n2:40:25.280 --> 2:40:28.840\n and perfuses the muscles and ligaments, et cetera,\n\n2:40:28.840 --> 2:40:29.800\n with more nutrients.\n\n2:40:29.800 --> 2:40:31.000\n And I should just mention\n\n2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:33.520\n that was a crucial piece of information.\n\n2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:34.900\n It's a little bit surprising.\n\n2:40:34.900 --> 2:40:36.080\n Was it surprising to you?\n\n2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:36.900\n Absolutely.\n\n2:40:36.900 --> 2:40:37.740\n Because I actually,\n\n2:40:37.740 --> 2:40:39.600\n the way I posed the question to him about cold\n\n2:40:39.600 --> 2:40:41.720\n was I hear that getting into an ice bath\n\n2:40:41.720 --> 2:40:43.280\n or a cold water immersion after training\n\n2:40:43.280 --> 2:40:44.200\n can reduce hypertrophy,\n\n2:40:44.200 --> 2:40:45.740\n but I'm guessing it's not that big of a deal.\n\n2:40:45.740 --> 2:40:47.120\n And he said, no, it is a big deal.\n\n2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:48.900\n It will short circuit your progress.\n\n2:40:48.900 --> 2:40:51.420\n Now, for people that are only interested in performance,\n\n2:40:51.420 --> 2:40:53.220\n who are doing a lot of workouts and trying to recover,\n\n2:40:53.220 --> 2:40:54.760\n but not trying to grow muscle, get stronger,\n\n2:40:54.760 --> 2:40:57.680\n or build endurance, then it makes sense to do cold.\n\n2:40:57.680 --> 2:40:58.840\n Like skill development or something.\n\n2:40:58.840 --> 2:41:01.960\n Skill development, or you're an athlete in season.\n\n2:41:01.960 --> 2:41:04.060\n So you have to, what's so great about Andy\n\n2:41:04.060 --> 2:41:06.880\n is he really points out the specific ways to train\n\n2:41:06.880 --> 2:41:08.120\n given your specific goals.\n\n2:41:08.120 --> 2:41:09.480\n So if we're getting swole,\n\n2:41:09.480 --> 2:41:12.440\n stay out of the ice bath after a workout, there you go.\n\n2:41:12.440 --> 2:41:14.600\n Lex is always making fun of the meatheads.\n\n2:41:14.600 --> 2:41:15.640\n I love it.\n\n2:41:15.640 --> 2:41:17.000\n I put myself in the meathead category\n\n2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:19.360\n only because I don't do a real sport now.\n\n2:41:19.360 --> 2:41:21.520\n I work out and I run, which is working out.\n\n2:41:21.520 --> 2:41:24.040\n I'm an aspiring meathead, okay, so.\n\n2:41:24.040 --> 2:41:25.720\n One of these days I'm going to get back to Jiu Jitsu,\n\n2:41:25.720 --> 2:41:27.200\n or I'm going to get to Jiu Jitsu.\n\n2:41:27.200 --> 2:41:28.360\n Now, in terms of training,\n\n2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:31.700\n he has this beautiful three by five concept for strength.\n\n2:41:31.700 --> 2:41:34.000\n Pick three exercises, compound exercises,\n\n2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:37.680\n multi joint movements, do them for,\n\n2:41:37.680 --> 2:41:40.480\n do three to five exercises\n\n2:41:40.480 --> 2:41:45.280\n for three to five repetitions per set,\n\n2:41:45.280 --> 2:41:47.000\n rest three to five minutes,\n\n2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:49.000\n and do that three to five times per week.\n\n2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:51.060\n And for details, you can, again, look to the episode.\n\n2:41:51.060 --> 2:41:51.900\n It's timestamped.\n\n2:41:51.900 --> 2:41:53.280\n But what's interesting about this is\n\n2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:55.400\n three to five times a week is a lot for a muscle group.\n\n2:41:55.400 --> 2:41:58.080\n Squatting five times a week for five reps,\n\n2:41:58.080 --> 2:42:00.240\n meaning you're working pretty heavy,\n\n2:42:00.240 --> 2:42:01.520\n meaning you're close to failure,\n\n2:42:01.520 --> 2:42:03.640\n but not failure for strength generally.\n\n2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:08.080\n What Andy taught me is that people\n\n2:42:08.080 --> 2:42:10.280\n who are training mostly for strength\n\n2:42:10.280 --> 2:42:13.880\n can do these low rep type regimens frequently\n\n2:42:13.880 --> 2:42:16.640\n because most of the adaptation is neural.\n\n2:42:16.640 --> 2:42:18.600\n And because you're not pushing to failure,\n\n2:42:18.600 --> 2:42:21.800\n in most cases, you don't get that sore.\n\n2:42:21.800 --> 2:42:25.800\n And so it's the motor neurons getting the muscle fibers\n\n2:42:25.800 --> 2:42:29.820\n to contract more intensely or with more efficiency\n\n2:42:29.820 --> 2:42:32.340\n in other ways that's leading to these strength gains.\n\n2:42:32.340 --> 2:42:34.600\n And this is why power lifters can train every day\n\n2:42:34.600 --> 2:42:37.280\n or five days a week or four days a week.\n\n2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:41.000\n For hypertrophy, I learned from Andy\n\n2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:44.220\n that the repetition range can be pretty broad.\n\n2:42:44.220 --> 2:42:47.820\n You're thinking anywhere from six to 30 repetitions.\n\n2:42:48.880 --> 2:42:52.280\n You should do 10 sets per muscle group per week,\n\n2:42:52.280 --> 2:42:53.640\n maybe even a bit more.\n\n2:42:53.640 --> 2:42:54.480\n So high volume.\n\n2:42:54.480 --> 2:42:59.120\n High volume, but you have to go to failure\n\n2:42:59.120 --> 2:43:01.380\n or beyond in order to stimulate growth.\n\n2:43:01.380 --> 2:43:03.760\n Why does it work at such a great range of repetitions?\n\n2:43:03.760 --> 2:43:06.240\n Well, there apparently are three ways\n\n2:43:06.240 --> 2:43:08.480\n that you stimulate hypertrophy and maybe more.\n\n2:43:08.480 --> 2:43:11.380\n One is tissue micro damage to the tissue.\n\n2:43:11.380 --> 2:43:14.640\n The other is through some sort of tension based changes\n\n2:43:14.640 --> 2:43:17.400\n in the molecular gene programs of cells\n\n2:43:17.400 --> 2:43:19.080\n that lead to protein synthesis\n\n2:43:19.080 --> 2:43:21.040\n that are distinct from damage.\n\n2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:22.560\n And the other are metabolic effects\n\n2:43:22.560 --> 2:43:23.760\n of like high repetition work\n\n2:43:23.760 --> 2:43:26.020\n of super fusion of the muscle with blood.\n\n2:43:26.020 --> 2:43:27.700\n We know that third category exists\n\n2:43:27.700 --> 2:43:29.960\n because people are now doing this blood restriction training\n\n2:43:29.960 --> 2:43:31.120\n where they cuff off a muscle\n\n2:43:31.120 --> 2:43:32.640\n and they'll use a really lightweight.\n\n2:43:32.640 --> 2:43:33.460\n I've done these before.\n\n2:43:33.460 --> 2:43:35.500\n You can use a five pound weight and do curls with this\n\n2:43:35.500 --> 2:43:38.280\n and you are in pain and the muscles are swelling up\n\n2:43:38.280 --> 2:43:39.120\n with blood.\n\n2:43:39.120 --> 2:43:40.360\n It does lead to hypertrophy,\n\n2:43:40.360 --> 2:43:42.940\n but in general, you're not sore.\n\n2:43:42.940 --> 2:43:44.680\n You're not doing tissue damage.\n\n2:43:44.680 --> 2:43:46.680\n And by the way, don't just turn to get off a muscle\n\n2:43:46.680 --> 2:43:48.780\n cause you have to use the proper cuffs\n\n2:43:48.780 --> 2:43:50.760\n because you need the blood still to flow in one direction.\n\n2:43:50.760 --> 2:43:52.000\n You can't just cinch it off\n\n2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:53.740\n or you'll potentially kill yourself\n\n2:43:53.740 --> 2:43:56.840\n if you get a clot or you do it wrong.\n\n2:43:56.840 --> 2:43:59.440\n So get the appropriate cuffs, they're out there.\n\n2:43:59.440 --> 2:44:01.600\n And then for endurance, I learned something really cool.\n\n2:44:01.600 --> 2:44:02.920\n So I work out basically,\n\n2:44:02.920 --> 2:44:06.320\n I go to the gym every other day on average,\n\n2:44:06.320 --> 2:44:07.520\n three or four days a week I do that,\n\n2:44:07.520 --> 2:44:09.800\n but generally not two days in a row to work out.\n\n2:44:09.800 --> 2:44:11.200\n Next day I'll do cardio next day.\n\n2:44:11.200 --> 2:44:14.200\n And the cardio for me is always a 30 to 45 minute jog\n\n2:44:14.200 --> 2:44:15.540\n kind of zone two cardio.\n\n2:44:16.640 --> 2:44:18.800\n Andy informed me that to build endurance\n\n2:44:18.800 --> 2:44:22.200\n while building strength and maintaining some muscle size\n\n2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:23.640\n or even building muscle size,\n\n2:44:24.520 --> 2:44:27.000\n I would be wise to take one day a week\n\n2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:32.000\n and add to that all out max heart rate work\n\n2:44:32.320 --> 2:44:34.560\n for 90 seconds at least.\n\n2:44:34.560 --> 2:44:36.120\n So do 90 seconds then rest\n\n2:44:36.120 --> 2:44:38.760\n and then maybe do another 90 second all out sprint.\n\n2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:41.480\n I almost missed my flight going from Los Angeles to Austin.\n\n2:44:41.480 --> 2:44:44.800\n I did that all out sprint in the airport yesterday.\n\n2:44:44.800 --> 2:44:47.600\n So I actually can think it's done for me.\n\n2:44:47.600 --> 2:44:51.840\n So there was a sprinting Dr. Huberman throughout.\n\n2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:52.840\n With three bags.\n\n2:44:52.840 --> 2:44:53.680\n That's awesome.\n\n2:44:53.680 --> 2:44:55.520\n Cause I travel, generally I'll travel\n\n2:44:55.520 --> 2:44:57.780\n with too much stuff.\n\n2:44:57.780 --> 2:45:00.200\n I love how you were probably running late for a flight\n\n2:45:00.200 --> 2:45:02.080\n and use that as an opportunity to explore.\n\n2:45:02.080 --> 2:45:02.960\n Well, I was doing it.\n\n2:45:02.960 --> 2:45:03.800\n I was thinking to myself,\n\n2:45:03.800 --> 2:45:05.880\n okay, Andy, that's a 90 second sprint.\n\n2:45:05.880 --> 2:45:07.780\n Cause I got to the security line.\n\n2:45:07.780 --> 2:45:08.620\n I finally got TSC.\n\n2:45:08.620 --> 2:45:11.360\n But that's for better, that's for extending endurance?\n\n2:45:11.360 --> 2:45:12.360\n That's for, yeah.\n\n2:45:12.360 --> 2:45:15.120\n It actually has some carry over effects on endurance\n\n2:45:15.120 --> 2:45:16.120\n if you're doing the other stuff.\n\n2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:18.280\n And then he also said one day a week to do this workout\n\n2:45:18.280 --> 2:45:19.120\n and I haven't done it yet.\n\n2:45:19.120 --> 2:45:19.960\n Maybe we do it tomorrow.\n\n2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:20.780\n It'd be fun.\n\n2:45:20.780 --> 2:45:22.740\n Which is you run a mile,\n\n2:45:22.740 --> 2:45:26.460\n you ask yourself, how long did that take?\n\n2:45:26.460 --> 2:45:28.420\n Let's say it took eight minutes.\n\n2:45:28.420 --> 2:45:30.660\n Then you walk or rest for eight minutes.\n\n2:45:30.660 --> 2:45:33.380\n Then you run another mile as fast as you can.\n\n2:45:33.380 --> 2:45:34.860\n And then you rest for the equivalent period.\n\n2:45:34.860 --> 2:45:38.020\n And you do that one to three times once per week.\n\n2:45:38.020 --> 2:45:38.900\n So you do.\n\n2:45:38.900 --> 2:45:41.620\n And so as an all around fitness program,\n\n2:45:41.620 --> 2:45:43.820\n it make, you could collapse this into something\n\n2:45:43.820 --> 2:45:44.660\n where you say, okay,\n\n2:45:44.660 --> 2:45:45.680\n you're gonna work out with the weights\n\n2:45:45.680 --> 2:45:48.000\n for about an hour every other day.\n\n2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:49.480\n Maybe take two days off every once in a while.\n\n2:45:49.480 --> 2:45:50.320\n Maybe not.\n\n2:45:50.320 --> 2:45:53.460\n You're going to do six to 15 repetitions.\n\n2:45:53.460 --> 2:45:56.020\n You're gonna push to failure on some of those, not all,\n\n2:45:56.020 --> 2:45:58.700\n because some of those are designed to build more strength.\n\n2:45:58.700 --> 2:46:00.180\n You're not going to failure in heavier.\n\n2:46:00.180 --> 2:46:02.340\n Some are designed for hypertrophy, higher rep\n\n2:46:02.340 --> 2:46:03.820\n and going to failure.\n\n2:46:03.820 --> 2:46:04.900\n And then on off days,\n\n2:46:04.900 --> 2:46:07.380\n you're gonna jog for 30 to 45 minutes.\n\n2:46:07.380 --> 2:46:09.180\n But for two days a week,\n\n2:46:09.180 --> 2:46:12.580\n you're either at the end of your jog or whatever,\n\n2:46:12.580 --> 2:46:15.480\n you're gonna do some all out sprints for 90 seconds\n\n2:46:15.480 --> 2:46:17.580\n and then rest and repeat.\n\n2:46:17.580 --> 2:46:22.580\n And for another day, you're going to do these mile repeats.\n\n2:46:22.720 --> 2:46:27.120\n That's a pretty large chunk of exercise movement.\n\n2:46:27.120 --> 2:46:30.120\n But if you kind of thread through the middle of all that,\n\n2:46:30.120 --> 2:46:32.340\n what you end up with is some decent strength,\n\n2:46:32.340 --> 2:46:34.820\n building protocols, some decent hypertrophy,\n\n2:46:34.820 --> 2:46:36.700\n some cardiovascular training\n\n2:46:36.700 --> 2:46:40.060\n that establishes the so called A base or a so called base.\n\n2:46:40.060 --> 2:46:42.040\n So you're not gonna get really good at anything.\n\n2:46:42.040 --> 2:46:44.040\n You're not gonna become a marathoner this way,\n\n2:46:44.040 --> 2:46:45.660\n an optimizing marathon.\n\n2:46:45.660 --> 2:46:47.100\n You're not gonna optimize powerlifting.\n\n2:46:47.100 --> 2:46:48.720\n You're not gonna optimize hypertrophy.\n\n2:46:48.720 --> 2:46:52.500\n But for the typical person, 75% of people, 75% of the time,\n\n2:46:52.500 --> 2:46:53.940\n they want some muscle, they want some strength,\n\n2:46:53.940 --> 2:46:54.940\n they want some endurance,\n\n2:46:54.940 --> 2:46:58.260\n and they want the capacity to sprint to the security gate\n\n2:46:58.260 --> 2:47:01.340\n without leaving a lung in the terminal.\n\n2:47:01.340 --> 2:47:03.140\n So it's like functional stuff,\n\n2:47:03.140 --> 2:47:05.820\n like your life going up the stairs is easier,\n\n2:47:05.820 --> 2:47:08.180\n moving about, all that kind of just regular life.\n\n2:47:08.180 --> 2:47:12.020\n And I should mention that cold showers after training\n\n2:47:12.020 --> 2:47:17.020\n don't seem to short circuit the training effect\n\n2:47:17.140 --> 2:47:19.540\n to the same extent that immersion in cold water does.\n\n2:47:19.540 --> 2:47:21.640\n And that really speaks to the fact that cold showers,\n\n2:47:21.640 --> 2:47:23.620\n even though they can provide some of the adrenaline\n\n2:47:23.620 --> 2:47:25.060\n for the mental effects of like,\n\n2:47:25.060 --> 2:47:26.460\n oh, I have a lot of adrenaline in my system\n\n2:47:26.460 --> 2:47:28.220\n from a cold shower and I can remain calm.\n\n2:47:28.220 --> 2:47:30.080\n There's utility to that.\n\n2:47:30.080 --> 2:47:32.840\n It's not going to have the same metabolic effects\n\n2:47:32.840 --> 2:47:35.060\n or other positive effects that cold water exposure\n\n2:47:35.060 --> 2:47:36.540\n has been shown to have.\n\n2:47:36.540 --> 2:47:39.020\n And that's unfortunate because most people\n\n2:47:39.020 --> 2:47:40.120\n have access to cold showers,\n\n2:47:40.120 --> 2:47:41.900\n not everyone has access to a cold dunker.\n\n2:47:41.900 --> 2:47:42.900\n Or an ice dunk.\n\n2:47:42.900 --> 2:47:45.900\n But here in Austin, you have this place,\n\n2:47:45.900 --> 2:47:47.060\n and no, they don't pay me to say this,\n\n2:47:47.060 --> 2:47:48.560\n but I always like going to this place\n\n2:47:48.560 --> 2:47:50.180\n whenever I'm in town, this place, Kuya.\n\n2:47:50.180 --> 2:47:52.580\n And they've got a sauna and a couple ice baths.\n\n2:47:52.580 --> 2:47:53.980\n And they even have those salt tanks\n\n2:47:53.980 --> 2:47:54.820\n that you can float on the surface.\n\n2:47:54.820 --> 2:47:55.940\n Do they have ice baths there?\n\n2:47:55.940 --> 2:47:59.300\n They have cold water immersion, it's pretty cold.\n\n2:47:59.300 --> 2:48:00.640\n Still haven't done an ice bath.\n\n2:48:00.640 --> 2:48:02.100\n Really? I need to, yeah, I need to.\n\n2:48:02.100 --> 2:48:03.500\n You're Russian, you'll probably get in\n\n2:48:03.500 --> 2:48:04.500\n and you won't even know.\n\n2:48:04.500 --> 2:48:05.340\n Yeah, what is this?\n\n2:48:05.340 --> 2:48:06.180\n What's the big deal here?\n\n2:48:06.180 --> 2:48:07.540\n Exactly, or people pay for this.\n\n2:48:08.500 --> 2:48:10.300\n I did a post, right, of you as a baby.\n\n2:48:10.300 --> 2:48:11.140\n Yeah.\n\n2:48:11.140 --> 2:48:14.540\n You know, I had to go deep to get that photo of Lex\n\n2:48:14.540 --> 2:48:16.620\n in a bassinet, in the snow.\n\n2:48:16.620 --> 2:48:17.580\n Yeah.\n\n2:48:17.580 --> 2:48:20.740\n Because in Russia, they actually did this for a long time.\n\n2:48:20.740 --> 2:48:21.620\n They thought that it would,\n\n2:48:21.620 --> 2:48:23.580\n and indeed it does build the immune system\n\n2:48:23.580 --> 2:48:25.780\n to expose babies to the cold.\n\n2:48:25.780 --> 2:48:27.820\n I still don't know where you got that photo.\n\n2:48:27.820 --> 2:48:29.820\n I didn't know you were able to find exactly the right,\n\n2:48:29.820 --> 2:48:31.540\n it was great.\n\n2:48:31.540 --> 2:48:32.380\n It was great research.\n\n2:48:32.380 --> 2:48:33.200\n You didn't have a tie on,\n\n2:48:33.200 --> 2:48:36.260\n but you had all the look and seriousness that you do now.\n\n2:48:36.260 --> 2:48:37.860\n So it's clearly nature nurture,\n\n2:48:37.860 --> 2:48:39.260\n clearly you were born with that.\n\n2:48:39.260 --> 2:48:40.300\n What about sauna?\n\n2:48:40.300 --> 2:48:42.500\n He does say that it's good to do heat.\n\n2:48:42.500 --> 2:48:44.020\n So there are three ways you can do sauna\n\n2:48:44.020 --> 2:48:46.060\n that I can just toss out as like briefings.\n\n2:48:46.060 --> 2:48:48.740\n If you want to get a really big growth hormone release\n\n2:48:48.740 --> 2:48:50.780\n for sake of metabolism, fat loss,\n\n2:48:50.780 --> 2:48:52.680\n you're training really, really hard in jujitsu\n\n2:48:52.680 --> 2:48:54.260\n and you want to recover,\n\n2:48:54.260 --> 2:48:56.380\n you don't want to sauna too often\n\n2:48:56.380 --> 2:48:59.920\n because the study that identified this massive\n\n2:48:59.920 --> 2:49:02.360\n 16 fold increase in growth hormone,\n\n2:49:02.360 --> 2:49:04.560\n they had people do this, it's crazy.\n\n2:49:04.560 --> 2:49:07.560\n They got into, okay, temperatures are 80\n\n2:49:07.560 --> 2:49:09.480\n to 100 degrees centigrade.\n\n2:49:09.480 --> 2:49:11.500\n So that's 176 degrees Fahrenheit\n\n2:49:11.500 --> 2:49:15.700\n to 212 degrees Fahrenheit for five to 30 minutes\n\n2:49:15.700 --> 2:49:17.740\n is the typical ranges that people work in\n\n2:49:17.740 --> 2:49:19.080\n in these research studies.\n\n2:49:20.300 --> 2:49:22.780\n For maximum growth hormone release,\n\n2:49:22.780 --> 2:49:24.960\n don't do sauna more than once a week,\n\n2:49:24.960 --> 2:49:27.980\n but get into the sauna for 30 minutes,\n\n2:49:27.980 --> 2:49:29.980\n as hot as you can safely tolerate.\n\n2:49:29.980 --> 2:49:31.620\n So probably for you, that'll be 210\n\n2:49:31.620 --> 2:49:34.900\n because I suspect you'll be on the high end of things.\n\n2:49:34.900 --> 2:49:38.580\n Then get out for five to 10 minutes, no cold exposure,\n\n2:49:38.580 --> 2:49:40.460\n get back in the sauna for 30 minutes.\n\n2:49:40.460 --> 2:49:41.880\n Then they had them do it again,\n\n2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:44.240\n out for five minutes, back for 30 minutes,\n\n2:49:44.240 --> 2:49:45.700\n out for five minutes, back for three minutes.\n\n2:49:45.700 --> 2:49:48.640\n They had them do two hours of sauna exposure\n\n2:49:48.640 --> 2:49:51.220\n to get that growth hormone release.\n\n2:49:51.220 --> 2:49:54.040\n Now for the reduction in likelihood\n\n2:49:54.040 --> 2:49:57.060\n of dying of a cardiovascular event stroke or otherwise,\n\n2:49:57.060 --> 2:49:59.240\n the more often you do sauna, the better.\n\n2:49:59.240 --> 2:50:01.860\n So if you look at all cause mortality\n\n2:50:01.860 --> 2:50:03.940\n or death due to cardiovascular events,\n\n2:50:03.940 --> 2:50:06.140\n and you look at sauna use frequencies\n\n2:50:06.140 --> 2:50:09.220\n using the same parameters, 80 to 100 degrees centigrade,\n\n2:50:09.220 --> 2:50:10.900\n one to seven times per week,\n\n2:50:10.900 --> 2:50:12.780\n basically the more often you get into the sauna\n\n2:50:12.780 --> 2:50:15.260\n for 30 minutes across the week,\n\n2:50:15.260 --> 2:50:17.920\n so 30 minutes a day is better than four times a week.\n\n2:50:17.920 --> 2:50:19.740\n Four times a week is better than two times a week\n\n2:50:19.740 --> 2:50:21.400\n and two times a week is better than one.\n\n2:50:21.400 --> 2:50:25.180\n And the reductions in mortality are really impressive.\n\n2:50:25.180 --> 2:50:29.180\n 27, if you get into the sauna the way I just described,\n\n2:50:29.180 --> 2:50:32.940\n not the two hours a day, but 30 minutes twice a week\n\n2:50:32.940 --> 2:50:33.980\n or three times per week,\n\n2:50:33.980 --> 2:50:35.980\n you reduce the likelihood of dying\n\n2:50:35.980 --> 2:50:38.980\n of a cardiovascular event by 27%.\n\n2:50:38.980 --> 2:50:41.240\n If you do it four or more times per week,\n\n2:50:41.240 --> 2:50:44.660\n you reduce the probability of dying by 50%\n\n2:50:44.660 --> 2:50:46.180\n of a cardiovascular event.\n\n2:50:46.180 --> 2:50:47.020\n And in these studies,\n\n2:50:47.020 --> 2:50:50.300\n they rule out other things that people are doing, smoking.\n\n2:50:50.300 --> 2:50:52.480\n They even ask them, do you live in an apartment?\n\n2:50:52.480 --> 2:50:53.820\n Are you in a happy relationship?\n\n2:50:53.820 --> 2:50:57.100\n Like they evaluate other potentially confounding variables.\n\n2:50:57.100 --> 2:50:59.200\n Now for people that don't have access to a sauna,\n\n2:50:59.200 --> 2:51:03.020\n a hot water bath or hot tub is gonna be your next best bet.\n\n2:51:03.020 --> 2:51:04.260\n And if you don't have access to that,\n\n2:51:04.260 --> 2:51:05.660\n do like the wrestlers do,\n\n2:51:05.660 --> 2:51:09.500\n which is put on two sets of sweats and a hoodie\n\n2:51:09.500 --> 2:51:12.780\n and a stocking cap and wrap yourself in plastics\n\n2:51:12.780 --> 2:51:14.480\n underneath all that and go for a run,\n\n2:51:14.480 --> 2:51:16.820\n but please nobody die of hyperthermia.\n\n2:51:16.820 --> 2:51:18.760\n I mean, you can die of warming up too much.\n\n2:51:18.760 --> 2:51:23.760\n Is this experience pleasant or stressful in the way,\n\n2:51:25.180 --> 2:51:27.380\n so is it as stressful as an ice bath, for example?\n\n2:51:27.380 --> 2:51:28.960\n Great question.\n\n2:51:28.960 --> 2:51:31.300\n People always ask how cold to make the ice bath\n\n2:51:31.300 --> 2:51:33.140\n or the cold water or the shower.\n\n2:51:33.140 --> 2:51:35.460\n You want it to be uncomfortably cold,\n\n2:51:35.460 --> 2:51:38.220\n meaning you want to feel like I really wanna get out,\n\n2:51:38.220 --> 2:51:39.300\n but you can safely stay in.\n\n2:51:39.300 --> 2:51:42.380\n And that's gonna vary by person and experience with it.\n\n2:51:42.380 --> 2:51:43.520\n Experience, yeah.\n\n2:51:43.520 --> 2:51:45.660\n With the sauna, it's the same thing.\n\n2:51:46.540 --> 2:51:47.620\n How hot to make it?\n\n2:51:47.620 --> 2:51:50.840\n Well, don't kill yourself, obviously be smart.\n\n2:51:50.840 --> 2:51:53.980\n If you're pregnant, you shouldn't be doing this anyway,\n\n2:51:53.980 --> 2:51:56.300\n but it's very clear that what you need\n\n2:51:56.300 --> 2:51:58.580\n is the release of something called dinorphin.\n\n2:51:58.580 --> 2:52:00.740\n We have endorphin, which makes us feel good.\n\n2:52:00.740 --> 2:52:04.280\n It binds to these mu opioid receptors in the body.\n\n2:52:04.280 --> 2:52:07.120\n You have dinorphin, which is the terrible feeling\n\n2:52:07.120 --> 2:52:09.420\n that you get when you're in really hot temperatures.\n\n2:52:09.420 --> 2:52:12.300\n It's also the terrible effect that alcoholics feel\n\n2:52:12.300 --> 2:52:14.180\n when they are in withdrawal.\n\n2:52:14.180 --> 2:52:15.900\n You feel agitated, you wanna get out,\n\n2:52:15.900 --> 2:52:16.740\n it's really unpleasant.\n\n2:52:16.740 --> 2:52:18.500\n It's dinorphin binding to the so called\n\n2:52:18.500 --> 2:52:22.300\n kappa opioid receptor, that's what you're trying to trigger.\n\n2:52:22.300 --> 2:52:24.260\n When you do that, a number of things happen.\n\n2:52:24.260 --> 2:52:27.060\n You set off heat shock proteins that go repair\n\n2:52:27.060 --> 2:52:29.660\n broken proteins and misfolded proteins.\n\n2:52:29.660 --> 2:52:33.780\n It also makes it so that later endorphin binds its receptor\n\n2:52:33.780 --> 2:52:34.620\n more strongly.\n\n2:52:34.620 --> 2:52:38.180\n So when you have this uncomfortable experience in the heat,\n\n2:52:38.180 --> 2:52:40.460\n you literally feel better in real life\n\n2:52:40.460 --> 2:52:42.900\n when pleasurable events come on,\n\n2:52:42.900 --> 2:52:44.340\n when you experience them.\n\n2:52:44.340 --> 2:52:45.840\n In the same way, I like to say this,\n\n2:52:45.840 --> 2:52:48.640\n that when you get into a cold ice bath or cold shower,\n\n2:52:48.640 --> 2:52:53.640\n the increase in epinephrine and dopamine is two to 300%.\n\n2:52:54.580 --> 2:52:57.140\n These are huge increases and they last many hours.\n\n2:52:57.140 --> 2:53:00.420\n This is shown, because lately I've gotten a little bit\n\n2:53:00.420 --> 2:53:04.900\n of pushback on Twitter, which is interesting place.\n\n2:53:06.180 --> 2:53:07.460\n People say, well, that's just in mice.\n\n2:53:07.460 --> 2:53:08.980\n No, all the studies I just referred to\n\n2:53:08.980 --> 2:53:11.300\n are all done in humans, men and women,\n\n2:53:11.300 --> 2:53:12.940\n fairly broad age ranges.\n\n2:53:12.940 --> 2:53:15.300\n So you want to be uncomfortable in the cold.\n\n2:53:15.300 --> 2:53:17.140\n You wanna be uncomfortable in the heat.\n\n2:53:17.140 --> 2:53:19.460\n This is why I'm not a big fan of infrared saunas\n\n2:53:19.460 --> 2:53:22.860\n because they only go up to about 160, 170 degrees.\n\n2:53:22.860 --> 2:53:26.040\n Infrared light and far red light of all kinds\n\n2:53:26.040 --> 2:53:27.980\n has been shown to be beneficial for wound healing,\n\n2:53:27.980 --> 2:53:29.780\n acne, skin, eyes.\n\n2:53:29.780 --> 2:53:31.500\n There are even guys now putting on their testicles\n\n2:53:31.500 --> 2:53:34.780\n because it can increase testosterone and sperm production.\n\n2:53:34.780 --> 2:53:36.100\n Yeah, hormone release.\n\n2:53:36.100 --> 2:53:37.100\n Hormone release.\n\n2:53:37.100 --> 2:53:39.020\n But in terms of the sauna,\n\n2:53:39.020 --> 2:53:41.540\n you want that strong heat stimulus.\n\n2:53:41.540 --> 2:53:44.900\n Yeah, and that's when you crawl up to the 200 mark\n\n2:53:44.900 --> 2:53:45.740\n and so on.\n\n2:53:45.740 --> 2:53:46.560\n Whenever I'm in New York,\n\n2:53:46.560 --> 2:53:47.740\n and there's also one in San Francisco,\n\n2:53:47.740 --> 2:53:49.960\n although the one in San Francisco is clothing optional,\n\n2:53:49.960 --> 2:53:52.940\n just to warn people, there's a place called Archimedes Banya.\n\n2:53:52.940 --> 2:53:55.620\n Is there any scientific evidence that being naked\n\n2:53:55.620 --> 2:53:57.460\n is beneficial in the sauna?\n\n2:53:57.460 --> 2:53:58.780\n Well, in certain contexts,\n\n2:53:58.780 --> 2:54:01.060\n it leads to childbirth.\n\n2:54:01.060 --> 2:54:03.020\n Okay, well, I'll have to read up on that.\n\n2:54:03.020 --> 2:54:04.700\n I read that somewhere.\n\n2:54:04.700 --> 2:54:07.460\n I suppose it's not required for childbirth,\n\n2:54:07.460 --> 2:54:10.100\n but in all seriousness,\n\n2:54:10.100 --> 2:54:12.340\n in New York, I'll go to a place called Spa 88,\n\n2:54:12.340 --> 2:54:14.580\n and actually, Khabib's picture is on the wall.\n\n2:54:14.580 --> 2:54:15.420\n He goes there.\n\n2:54:15.420 --> 2:54:18.100\n And that one, it's clothing.\n\n2:54:18.100 --> 2:54:19.180\n They require clothing.\n\n2:54:19.180 --> 2:54:20.020\n I only just say that\n\n2:54:20.020 --> 2:54:21.900\n because it can be a little bit of a shock to people sometimes\n\n2:54:21.900 --> 2:54:22.740\n if they kind of walk in there,\n\n2:54:22.740 --> 2:54:25.380\n a bunch of naked people, the one in San Francisco.\n\n2:54:25.380 --> 2:54:26.500\n If I go, I'm clothed,\n\n2:54:26.500 --> 2:54:29.420\n mostly because I run into coworkers or things like that.\n\n2:54:29.420 --> 2:54:33.040\n You know, I'm sort of more old fashioned in that way,\n\n2:54:33.040 --> 2:54:33.880\n I suppose.\n\n2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:34.700\n But...\n\n2:54:34.700 --> 2:54:36.440\n Do you like to wear clothes around coworkers?\n\n2:54:36.440 --> 2:54:37.280\n Yes.\n\n2:54:37.280 --> 2:54:38.100\n Yeah, in general. Very old fashioned.\n\n2:54:38.100 --> 2:54:40.180\n Yeah, I mean, to me, it just seems like, you know,\n\n2:54:40.180 --> 2:54:41.020\n just be aware.\n\n2:54:41.020 --> 2:54:44.400\n But nonetheless, the Banyas have very hot saunas\n\n2:54:44.400 --> 2:54:46.180\n because they're Russian owned.\n\n2:54:46.180 --> 2:54:48.040\n And in New York, there's one on the Lower East Side,\n\n2:54:48.040 --> 2:54:51.220\n but the Spa 88 place, they have some saunas\n\n2:54:51.220 --> 2:54:53.940\n that the moment I get into those,\n\n2:54:53.940 --> 2:54:55.580\n I have a hard time catching a full breath.\n\n2:54:55.580 --> 2:54:56.720\n It burns.\n\n2:54:56.720 --> 2:54:59.340\n They've got a cold dunk that's like a shock.\n\n2:54:59.340 --> 2:55:01.460\n And then they've got a sauna, a wet sauna steam room\n\n2:55:01.460 --> 2:55:02.700\n that's a little mellower.\n\n2:55:02.700 --> 2:55:03.940\n So the nice thing about a Banya\n\n2:55:03.940 --> 2:55:05.760\n is you can kind of find your place.\n\n2:55:05.760 --> 2:55:06.820\n And then they do the plaza\n\n2:55:06.820 --> 2:55:08.900\n where they take the eucalyptus leaves\n\n2:55:08.900 --> 2:55:10.440\n and you can pay someone.\n\n2:55:10.440 --> 2:55:12.180\n And you basically, you cover your groin\n\n2:55:12.180 --> 2:55:15.700\n and then they beat you with the leaves.\n\n2:55:15.700 --> 2:55:17.640\n And it's supposed to bring the vasculature to the surface.\n\n2:55:17.640 --> 2:55:18.780\n I've only done it once.\n\n2:55:18.780 --> 2:55:22.380\n And frankly, I found it to be a little bit unnerving.\n\n2:55:22.380 --> 2:55:24.140\n I didn't really like the experience,\n\n2:55:24.140 --> 2:55:26.060\n but I'll try and get into a sauna\n\n2:55:26.060 --> 2:55:28.040\n as often as I possibly can,\n\n2:55:28.040 --> 2:55:30.380\n which is once or three times per week.\n\n2:55:30.380 --> 2:55:34.860\n And I try and do the cold exposure shower or immersion,\n\n2:55:34.860 --> 2:55:37.780\n but early in the day, cause it really wakes you up.\n\n2:55:37.780 --> 2:55:40.340\n One of my favorite things I've listened to,\n\n2:55:40.340 --> 2:55:42.100\n I wish there was a video,\n\n2:55:42.100 --> 2:55:45.140\n is listening to a bunch of stuff with Rick Rubin.\n\n2:55:45.140 --> 2:55:47.780\n And he did a thing with Tim Ferriss,\n\n2:55:47.780 --> 2:55:49.060\n like the Tim Ferriss podcast.\n\n2:55:49.060 --> 2:55:50.540\n I don't know if you've ever heard it,\n\n2:55:50.540 --> 2:55:55.540\n but he forced them to do, they did the podcast in a sauna.\n\n2:55:56.660 --> 2:56:01.020\n And I don't think at the time Tim Ferriss was adapted.\n\n2:56:01.020 --> 2:56:03.180\n If you're not heat adapted, it can be pretty stressful.\n\n2:56:03.180 --> 2:56:05.740\n And I mean, obviously the whole experience is stressful\n\n2:56:05.740 --> 2:56:09.340\n as somebody with microphones, like what is happening?\n\n2:56:09.340 --> 2:56:12.940\n But I just love that Tim was vulnerable enough\n\n2:56:12.940 --> 2:56:15.540\n to kind of give themself over\n\n2:56:15.540 --> 2:56:17.260\n to whatever the hell this experience is.\n\n2:56:17.260 --> 2:56:22.140\n And I am just so happy that Rick like pushed\n\n2:56:22.140 --> 2:56:25.740\n that kind of idea and just let's do it.\n\n2:56:25.740 --> 2:56:27.740\n That's a very Rick Rubin kind of thing to do.\n\n2:56:27.740 --> 2:56:31.620\n And we must, like we must do this, this has to be done.\n\n2:56:31.620 --> 2:56:34.740\n A podcast that was done from a sauna continuously\n\n2:56:34.740 --> 2:56:35.680\n would be really interesting.\n\n2:56:35.680 --> 2:56:37.180\n Like you could call it like the pressure cooker\n\n2:56:37.180 --> 2:56:38.020\n or something.\n\n2:56:38.020 --> 2:56:38.940\n Oh, I mean like a regular podcast.\n\n2:56:38.940 --> 2:56:42.140\n Yeah, like you have to sit with your guests in the sauna\n\n2:56:42.140 --> 2:56:43.700\n or they have to sit in the sauna.\n\n2:56:43.700 --> 2:56:45.260\n That was one of the interesting things\n\n2:56:45.260 --> 2:56:48.940\n is it was a sad thing because I believe there's no video\n\n2:56:48.940 --> 2:56:53.740\n of that podcast, but you could tell there was a kind of,\n\n2:56:53.740 --> 2:56:56.700\n there was suffering and especially on Tim's part.\n\n2:56:56.700 --> 2:56:58.260\n It was like a degradation.\n\n2:56:58.260 --> 2:57:01.380\n He started over time not being able\n\n2:57:01.380 --> 2:57:05.600\n to put words together correctly, which he's very eloquent.\n\n2:57:05.600 --> 2:57:10.540\n And so you could see there's like, there's a struggle.\n\n2:57:10.540 --> 2:57:12.760\n Heat and cold pull you down from the inside.\n\n2:57:12.760 --> 2:57:14.140\n You have to, I mean, there's a reason why\n\n2:57:14.140 --> 2:57:18.820\n the screening process for, they call it SEAL training,\n\n2:57:18.820 --> 2:57:21.420\n but it's really screening and training involves cold waters.\n\n2:57:21.420 --> 2:57:23.300\n Cause if you're in the heat too long,\n\n2:57:23.300 --> 2:57:25.060\n you'll die or damage tissue.\n\n2:57:25.060 --> 2:57:27.160\n In cold, you can do it quite extensively\n\n2:57:27.160 --> 2:57:30.220\n before you die or damage tissue, but it is stressful.\n\n2:57:30.220 --> 2:57:33.620\n I was going to say one thing that I sometimes enjoy seeing\n\n2:57:33.620 --> 2:57:35.740\n these social media posts where people will get\n\n2:57:35.740 --> 2:57:37.880\n into the ice bath and they'll look really stoic.\n\n2:57:37.880 --> 2:57:39.180\n Like they're really tough,\n\n2:57:39.180 --> 2:57:43.300\n but actually that's the wimpy way to go through it.\n\n2:57:43.300 --> 2:57:47.380\n When you get into cold water, if you stay very still,\n\n2:57:47.380 --> 2:57:51.380\n you develop a thermal sheath around you\n\n2:57:51.380 --> 2:57:53.300\n that you're warming yourself.\n\n2:57:53.300 --> 2:57:56.300\n The really bold way is to get in and continue\n\n2:57:56.300 --> 2:57:57.740\n to sift your arms and legs.\n\n2:57:57.740 --> 2:58:00.940\n And it ends up feeling miserably colder.\n\n2:58:00.940 --> 2:58:02.020\n And then there's no sheath\n\n2:58:02.020 --> 2:58:04.580\n cause you're breaking up that thermal layer.\n\n2:58:04.580 --> 2:58:06.500\n And then when you get out, you'll notice a lot\n\n2:58:06.500 --> 2:58:09.620\n of people huddle or they'll put, or they'll grab the towel.\n\n2:58:09.620 --> 2:58:10.500\n In general, that's me.\n\n2:58:10.500 --> 2:58:12.580\n I'll get back, I'll get into the sauna.\n\n2:58:12.580 --> 2:58:15.100\n But if you really want to stimulate the big increases\n\n2:58:15.100 --> 2:58:18.080\n in metabolism, you stand out there and you dry off\n\n2:58:18.080 --> 2:58:20.780\n with arms extended in open air.\n\n2:58:20.780 --> 2:58:23.660\n And as that water evaporates off you, it is really cold,\n\n2:58:23.660 --> 2:58:25.820\n but your body is forced to activate a number\n\n2:58:25.820 --> 2:58:28.480\n of the warming programs related to metabolism.\n\n2:58:28.480 --> 2:58:31.100\n This is the beautiful work of a woman named Susanna Soberg,\n\n2:58:31.100 --> 2:58:32.420\n who's Scandinavian.\n\n2:58:32.420 --> 2:58:34.980\n She published this paper last year in Cell Reports Medicine.\n\n2:58:34.980 --> 2:58:36.820\n And so I call this the Soberg principle,\n\n2:58:36.820 --> 2:58:40.300\n which is if you're doing ice and heat for whatever reason,\n\n2:58:40.300 --> 2:58:41.900\n it doesn't matter if you end on heat or cold,\n\n2:58:41.900 --> 2:58:44.140\n but if you're using cold specifically\n\n2:58:44.140 --> 2:58:47.820\n to stimulate an increase in metabolism, end with cold.\n\n2:58:47.820 --> 2:58:49.960\n That's the Soberg principle.\n\n2:58:49.960 --> 2:58:52.340\n And with cold, if you're alternating,\n\n2:58:52.340 --> 2:58:55.400\n and then if you want to do it the tough way,\n\n2:58:55.400 --> 2:58:57.940\n you let the shivering, so you just stand out\n\n2:58:57.940 --> 2:58:59.220\n and let the water evaporate.\n\n2:58:59.220 --> 2:59:01.620\n Yeah, I mean, if you ever waded into a cold ocean,\n\n2:59:01.620 --> 2:59:04.140\n everybody's kind of like holding themselves in,\n\n2:59:04.140 --> 2:59:06.900\n if you really just, if you let yourself extend your limbs\n\n2:59:06.900 --> 2:59:08.420\n and move them around a bit so you break up\n\n2:59:08.420 --> 2:59:12.020\n that thermal layer, that's the tough way to do it.\n\n2:59:12.020 --> 2:59:13.580\n So when I see people on social media getting in\n\n2:59:13.580 --> 2:59:16.420\n and they're like really tough and trying to look hard.\n\n2:59:16.420 --> 2:59:17.820\n Yeah, you want to be moving around.\n\n2:59:17.820 --> 2:59:22.620\n Yeah, smiling, talking, moving around is way, way colder.\n\n2:59:22.620 --> 2:59:23.780\n Are you able to talk?\n\n2:59:23.780 --> 2:59:27.860\n Can you do, so you suggest the podcast in the sauna.\n\n2:59:27.860 --> 2:59:28.700\n How about this?\n\n2:59:28.700 --> 2:59:29.700\n I proposed this since I got choked.\n\n2:59:29.700 --> 2:59:31.260\n You want to do the next podcast?\n\n2:59:31.260 --> 2:59:33.980\n I'll get to, so the folks from The Plunge,\n\n2:59:33.980 --> 2:59:35.780\n maybe you could bring Lex a plunge.\n\n2:59:35.780 --> 2:59:37.740\n He certainly deserves one.\n\n2:59:37.740 --> 2:59:40.180\n And we can go side by side coffin style,\n\n2:59:40.180 --> 2:59:42.180\n or we can face one another when we're doing it.\n\n2:59:42.180 --> 2:59:44.060\n Well, we said we should do each other's podcast.\n\n2:59:44.060 --> 2:59:44.980\n I mean, it'd be next.\n\n2:59:44.980 --> 2:59:46.280\n Well, I can't wait to have you back on.\n\n2:59:46.280 --> 2:59:47.500\n I mean, we only scratched the surface.\n\n2:59:47.500 --> 2:59:49.060\n Well, let's do at least part of the next\n\n2:59:49.060 --> 2:59:51.380\n Human Lab podcast either in the.\n\n2:59:51.380 --> 2:59:53.580\n I have a sauna and a cold plunge, so we could do it.\n\n2:59:53.580 --> 2:59:55.020\n Yeah, we could do.\n\n2:59:55.020 --> 2:59:57.140\n We do a sauna and a cold plunge version.\n\n2:59:57.140 --> 2:59:59.580\n I wonder how the recording works,\n\n2:59:59.580 --> 3:00:01.460\n if the recording. A bit of an echo in the sauna,\n\n3:00:01.460 --> 3:00:04.060\n but I'm sure we can take out the reverb.\n\n3:00:04.060 --> 3:00:08.720\n So Sergey wants to ask you about sex performance.\n\n3:00:09.820 --> 3:00:12.340\n Very journalistic, very hardcore hitting questions\n\n3:00:12.340 --> 3:00:13.180\n that we have here on the.\n\n3:00:13.180 --> 3:00:15.140\n Generally, or a specific.\n\n3:00:15.140 --> 3:00:18.260\n No, he has a certain problem he needs help with, no.\n\n3:00:18.260 --> 3:00:21.580\n Generally, you haven't done an episode on sex.\n\n3:00:21.580 --> 3:00:24.940\n Well, we did an episode early on, on sexual development.\n\n3:00:24.940 --> 3:00:25.760\n Yes.\n\n3:00:25.760 --> 3:00:27.660\n We've done them on optimizing testosterone and estrogen.\n\n3:00:27.660 --> 3:00:31.300\n And we touched a little bit on the, on libido\n\n3:00:31.300 --> 3:00:34.900\n and somewhat on sex performance, but not much.\n\n3:00:34.900 --> 3:00:38.420\n We did an episode on relationships, love and desire,\n\n3:00:38.420 --> 3:00:40.740\n where we touched on libido specifically.\n\n3:00:40.740 --> 3:00:43.060\n So just as a quick mention of something,\n\n3:00:43.060 --> 3:00:46.060\n a lot of people take SSRIs or antidepressants\n\n3:00:46.060 --> 3:00:47.860\n that can disrupt sexual function.\n\n3:00:47.860 --> 3:00:51.720\n There are a few compounds like maca root and punga ali\n\n3:00:51.720 --> 3:00:53.680\n and things like that, that at least in a few studies\n\n3:00:53.680 --> 3:00:55.180\n in humans have been shown to offset\n\n3:00:55.180 --> 3:00:57.260\n some of the sexual side effects.\n\n3:00:57.260 --> 3:01:01.300\n Now, in terms of sexual, and then the, sorry,\n\n3:01:01.300 --> 3:01:04.220\n the episode on sexual development was about how the brain\n\n3:01:04.220 --> 3:01:06.340\n and body become organized in certain ways,\n\n3:01:06.340 --> 3:01:09.380\n how the brain becomes organized if you have X chromosomes\n\n3:01:09.380 --> 3:01:11.060\n or Y chromosomes or et cetera.\n\n3:01:11.060 --> 3:01:12.100\n So early, early development.\n\n3:01:12.100 --> 3:01:13.220\n Early development mainly.\n\n3:01:13.220 --> 3:01:16.540\n And the effects of hormones later on that template.\n\n3:01:16.540 --> 3:01:21.000\n We will be doing a, I'm actually putting together a series\n\n3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:26.000\n on sexual health, everything from the menstrual cycle,\n\n3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:28.940\n which both men and women should understand, of course,\n\n3:01:28.940 --> 3:01:32.060\n understanding arousal, understanding, for instance,\n\n3:01:32.060 --> 3:01:33.140\n a lot of people don't realize this,\n\n3:01:33.140 --> 3:01:37.000\n but that orgasm is actually the consequence of activity\n\n3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:40.220\n in the sympathetic, meaning the stress arm\n\n3:01:40.220 --> 3:01:42.580\n of the autonomic nervous system.\n\n3:01:42.580 --> 3:01:46.680\n Whereas arousal is the consequence of the activity\n\n3:01:46.680 --> 3:01:49.220\n of the parasympathetic, the calming aspect\n\n3:01:49.220 --> 3:01:51.300\n of the autonomic nervous system.\n\n3:01:51.300 --> 3:01:52.700\n That's counterintuitive, right?\n\n3:01:52.700 --> 3:01:55.020\n It's counterintuitive and it kind of works like a seesaw.\n\n3:01:55.020 --> 3:01:56.860\n I mean, there's arousal, then there's relaxation,\n\n3:01:56.860 --> 3:02:01.620\n then there's arousal, and then immediately after orgasm\n\n3:02:01.620 --> 3:02:03.540\n and in males ejaculation, what ends up happening\n\n3:02:03.540 --> 3:02:07.020\n is there's a rebounding of the parasympathetic nervous system\n\n3:02:07.020 --> 3:02:09.580\n which it leads to oftentimes people feeling very relaxed\n\n3:02:09.580 --> 3:02:11.380\n or falling asleep.\n\n3:02:11.380 --> 3:02:15.100\n So I'm going to do a short series on sexual health\n\n3:02:15.100 --> 3:02:17.980\n that will include stuff about sexual performance,\n\n3:02:17.980 --> 3:02:22.980\n but also some, I'm working on getting an expert guest\n\n3:02:22.980 --> 3:02:26.820\n who can talk about some of the neurologic changes\n\n3:02:26.820 --> 3:02:30.380\n that happen as a consequence of sexual activity.\n\n3:02:30.380 --> 3:02:33.900\n And we did an episode with a guy from UT Austin here,\n\n3:02:33.900 --> 3:02:36.320\n David Buss, who's an evolutionary psychologist,\n\n3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:41.240\n talking about, it went pretty deep into some of the typical\n\n3:02:41.240 --> 3:02:44.900\n and unusual dynamics of mating relation,\n\n3:02:44.900 --> 3:02:46.940\n whether or not people have kids or not and what impacts that,\n\n3:02:46.940 --> 3:02:49.620\n but we're going to do an episode on menopause, andropause.\n\n3:02:49.620 --> 3:02:52.500\n What's very surprising is I get a lot of questions\n\n3:02:52.500 --> 3:02:55.460\n about sexual health from the young male audience,\n\n3:02:56.780 --> 3:03:00.240\n which tells me that, well, here's what I think it reflects.\n\n3:03:00.240 --> 3:03:03.460\n I think that women, because of their menstrual cycles,\n\n3:03:03.460 --> 3:03:06.540\n early on start to talk to one another about changes\n\n3:03:06.540 --> 3:03:08.540\n in physiology and psychology as a function\n\n3:03:08.540 --> 3:03:10.500\n of this 28 day cycle that they all experience\n\n3:03:10.500 --> 3:03:11.820\n sooner or later.\n\n3:03:11.820 --> 3:03:14.120\n Males, there's less of a conversation\n\n3:03:14.120 --> 3:03:15.700\n and it usually arrives in code.\n\n3:03:15.700 --> 3:03:16.900\n People will say, hey, what should I take\n\n3:03:16.900 --> 3:03:18.220\n to increase my testosterone?\n\n3:03:18.220 --> 3:03:20.500\n And I'll say, well, maybe nothing.\n\n3:03:20.500 --> 3:03:23.580\n You know, what are you specifically concerned about?\n\n3:03:23.580 --> 3:03:25.340\n And then over time, if you pull on those threads\n\n3:03:25.340 --> 3:03:28.200\n a little bit, you know, you get your answer.\n\n3:03:28.200 --> 3:03:30.720\n Sometimes I'll just get a direct question.\n\n3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:33.500\n But I think that the psychology of all this\n\n3:03:33.500 --> 3:03:36.860\n and in terms of jealousy and the terms of notions\n\n3:03:36.860 --> 3:03:40.500\n of roles and relationships is very dynamic right now.\n\n3:03:40.500 --> 3:03:41.660\n And I'm fascinated by this.\n\n3:03:41.660 --> 3:03:43.740\n So we're going to do a four episode series.\n\n3:03:43.740 --> 3:03:45.180\n What about sexual fantasy?\n\n3:03:46.500 --> 3:03:48.860\n What, to get Freudian for a second,\n\n3:03:48.860 --> 3:03:52.820\n what role does sexual fantasy have in the human condition?\n\n3:03:52.820 --> 3:03:56.060\n There's a book called The Erotic Imagination.\n\n3:03:56.060 --> 3:03:57.500\n It's a very psychoanalytic book written\n\n3:03:57.500 --> 3:04:01.220\n by a psychoanalyst that talks about how,\n\n3:04:01.220 --> 3:04:03.180\n well, here's the uncomfortable reality.\n\n3:04:03.180 --> 3:04:05.260\n Freud was at least right about one thing,\n\n3:04:05.260 --> 3:04:09.020\n which is that the brain circuitry that you used\n\n3:04:09.020 --> 3:04:11.180\n to develop attachments to your caregivers,\n\n3:04:11.180 --> 3:04:13.340\n mother and father or other caregivers,\n\n3:04:14.300 --> 3:04:16.700\n do not disappear when you hit puberty.\n\n3:04:16.700 --> 3:04:20.380\n They are repurposed for romantic and sexual relations.\n\n3:04:20.380 --> 3:04:23.780\n And so this is why the whole notion of anxious attached\n\n3:04:23.780 --> 3:04:26.300\n and secure attached, you know, stems from childhood\n\n3:04:26.300 --> 3:04:27.940\n attachment patterns, but it carries over\n\n3:04:27.940 --> 3:04:29.820\n to romantic relationships.\n\n3:04:29.820 --> 3:04:32.580\n So that the relationship with your mother has.\n\n3:04:32.580 --> 3:04:33.420\n And father.\n\n3:04:33.420 --> 3:04:36.980\n And father has a, and probably other close people to you\n\n3:04:36.980 --> 3:04:41.340\n in your young age has a secondary, tertiary,\n\n3:04:41.340 --> 3:04:44.420\n some kind of ripple effect on how your sexuality developed.\n\n3:04:44.420 --> 3:04:46.180\n Like what fantasies you might have, all that.\n\n3:04:46.180 --> 3:04:47.220\n No, without question.\n\n3:04:47.220 --> 3:04:48.980\n And of course, early experiences too,\n\n3:04:48.980 --> 3:04:51.780\n and traumatic or positive or neutral.\n\n3:04:51.780 --> 3:04:53.580\n The thing that's really important to remember though,\n\n3:04:53.580 --> 3:04:57.180\n in this transfer of circuitry from one role to another\n\n3:04:57.180 --> 3:05:00.860\n is that, and it's certainly consistent with psychoanalysis\n\n3:05:00.860 --> 3:05:04.820\n that gender is interchangeable, sex is interchangeable.\n\n3:05:04.820 --> 3:05:07.660\n So for instance, let's say you had a wonderful relationship.\n\n3:05:07.660 --> 3:05:10.860\n Let's say this, let's take a hypothetical person, okay?\n\n3:05:10.860 --> 3:05:12.220\n I'm truly not referring to myself.\n\n3:05:12.220 --> 3:05:15.700\n Let's take a young woman who has a wonderful relationship\n\n3:05:15.700 --> 3:05:18.660\n with her father and a just absolutely terrible\n\n3:05:18.660 --> 3:05:20.340\n abusive relationship to her mother.\n\n3:05:20.340 --> 3:05:21.620\n Just for sake of example.\n\n3:05:22.620 --> 3:05:26.420\n She then goes into adulthood and she is drawn\n\n3:05:26.420 --> 3:05:28.980\n to very abusive men.\n\n3:05:28.980 --> 3:05:31.260\n Not always, but let's just use in this example.\n\n3:05:32.180 --> 3:05:34.260\n And the dynamic is exactly the same\n\n3:05:34.260 --> 3:05:36.100\n as the dynamic she had with her mother.\n\n3:05:36.100 --> 3:05:37.900\n That's actually a common occurrence.\n\n3:05:37.900 --> 3:05:40.580\n Even though in this context, she's heterosexual,\n\n3:05:40.580 --> 3:05:41.980\n she's romantically attracted to men.\n\n3:05:41.980 --> 3:05:44.660\n What is seen over and over again is that the dynamic\n\n3:05:44.660 --> 3:05:47.620\n with one parent can be transferred onto a romantic dynamic,\n\n3:05:47.620 --> 3:05:49.540\n but it doesn't have to be, you know,\n\n3:05:49.540 --> 3:05:51.100\n that if it was with the mother,\n\n3:05:51.100 --> 3:05:53.380\n then it only has to do with relationships to women.\n\n3:05:53.380 --> 3:05:54.940\n So gender is interchangeable\n\n3:05:54.940 --> 3:05:58.300\n because these circuitries are presexual.\n\n3:05:58.300 --> 3:06:00.020\n They're laid down in our brain\n\n3:06:00.020 --> 3:06:04.220\n before the brain has any concept of sexual interactions.\n\n3:06:04.220 --> 3:06:06.620\n It's preverbal, excuse me.\n\n3:06:06.620 --> 3:06:09.860\n And so there are a lot of interesting examples\n\n3:06:09.860 --> 3:06:11.100\n and data to support this.\n\n3:06:11.100 --> 3:06:14.700\n The book Attached is a pretty interesting book\n\n3:06:14.700 --> 3:06:16.260\n by two psychologists.\n\n3:06:16.260 --> 3:06:18.140\n One I think is at Columbia University\n\n3:06:19.140 --> 3:06:22.700\n that talks about how childhood dynamics carry over\n\n3:06:22.700 --> 3:06:25.620\n to adult romantic attachment.\n\n3:06:25.620 --> 3:06:27.820\n So as you can tell, I get pretty alert\n\n3:06:27.820 --> 3:06:29.140\n in response to these questions.\n\n3:06:29.140 --> 3:06:32.140\n I get a lot of them relate in this domain.\n\n3:06:32.140 --> 3:06:33.620\n They have a lot of impact on people\n\n3:06:33.620 --> 3:06:35.380\n and they're wondering about, they wanna learn.\n\n3:06:35.380 --> 3:06:37.060\n And no one knows what other people are doing\n\n3:06:37.060 --> 3:06:37.900\n or what's normal.\n\n3:06:37.900 --> 3:06:39.220\n We kind of know deviancy.\n\n3:06:39.220 --> 3:06:40.100\n We know perversion.\n\n3:06:40.100 --> 3:06:42.100\n We know the extremes.\n\n3:06:42.100 --> 3:06:43.100\n We know the rules.\n\n3:06:43.100 --> 3:06:44.460\n Hopefully people know the rules,\n\n3:06:44.460 --> 3:06:47.660\n but let's just be,\n\n3:06:47.660 --> 3:06:51.660\n there are a lot of people in the academic community,\n\n3:06:51.660 --> 3:06:54.780\n in particular at certain East Coast schools not to be named\n\n3:06:54.780 --> 3:06:57.580\n that are in open relationships.\n\n3:06:57.580 --> 3:06:58.880\n This is more common now.\n\n3:06:59.940 --> 3:07:03.340\n It's not very common, but it's more common.\n\n3:07:03.340 --> 3:07:06.900\n And obviously that's a way of bypassing\n\n3:07:06.900 --> 3:07:08.540\n some of these more primitive emotions\n\n3:07:08.540 --> 3:07:10.220\n about jealousy, et cetera,\n\n3:07:10.220 --> 3:07:12.300\n and leveraging them towards\n\n3:07:12.300 --> 3:07:13.920\n maybe even ongoing relationships.\n\n3:07:13.920 --> 3:07:16.060\n I'm not passing judgment one way or the other.\n\n3:07:16.060 --> 3:07:18.420\n I always say four conditions have to be met\n\n3:07:18.420 --> 3:07:21.020\n for any discussion about sex and sexuality\n\n3:07:21.020 --> 3:07:21.980\n or sexual health.\n\n3:07:21.980 --> 3:07:25.060\n Age appropriate, context appropriate,\n\n3:07:25.060 --> 3:07:27.340\n consensual and species appropriate.\n\n3:07:28.300 --> 3:07:31.600\n Well, that's weird because the thing I'm trying to figure out\n\n3:07:31.600 --> 3:07:36.600\n is why my sexual fantasy is to go to furry orgies\n\n3:07:36.600 --> 3:07:41.180\n and have sex with others dressed as squirrels\n\n3:07:41.180 --> 3:07:43.340\n and me, the other animals.\n\n3:07:43.340 --> 3:07:48.100\n So that could be, I'll see a therapist about that one.\n\n3:07:48.100 --> 3:07:48.940\n Can I ask you?\n\n3:07:48.940 --> 3:07:52.260\n I'm not gonna respond to that except to say that\n\n3:07:52.260 --> 3:07:54.580\n as long as those four conditions are met.\n\n3:07:54.580 --> 3:07:55.420\n Yeah.\n\n3:07:55.420 --> 3:07:56.260\n Consensual, age appropriate,\n\n3:07:56.260 --> 3:07:57.860\n context appropriate, species appropriate.\n\n3:07:57.860 --> 3:08:00.860\n So there's a bunch of questions on Instagram.\n\n3:08:00.860 --> 3:08:05.260\n One of them on this topic, on relationships,\n\n3:08:05.260 --> 3:08:08.540\n somebody suggested to do a part three of why Lex is single.\n\n3:08:08.540 --> 3:08:11.420\n There's a running joke about this.\n\n3:08:11.420 --> 3:08:12.260\n So.\n\n3:08:12.260 --> 3:08:14.620\n But I can answer it in part, right?\n\n3:08:14.620 --> 3:08:17.340\n Because, well, partially because you're very busy,\n\n3:08:17.340 --> 3:08:22.340\n partially because you've decided that until it's time,\n\n3:08:22.980 --> 3:08:26.680\n you're gonna wait until it's time, it's time, right?\n\n3:08:26.680 --> 3:08:28.140\n I mean, until it's time, you're waiting.\n\n3:08:28.140 --> 3:08:31.060\n And then, I mean, not saving yourself for marriage,\n\n3:08:31.060 --> 3:08:34.420\n I don't think, but in some sense,\n\n3:08:34.420 --> 3:08:37.700\n yeah, your future wife is out there.\n\n3:08:37.700 --> 3:08:38.540\n Oh yeah, yeah.\n\n3:08:38.540 --> 3:08:39.820\n She's being programmed.\n\n3:08:39.820 --> 3:08:43.100\n No, I mean, I definitely believe that.\n\n3:08:43.100 --> 3:08:45.140\n I mean, first of all, I just love people\n\n3:08:45.140 --> 3:08:47.060\n and I fall in love very easily with people,\n\n3:08:47.060 --> 3:08:50.140\n with objects, with things, with life, with every moment.\n\n3:08:50.140 --> 3:08:51.940\n And that way you're like Oliver Sacks,\n\n3:08:51.940 --> 3:08:53.580\n he would fall in love with minerals\n\n3:08:54.800 --> 3:08:56.540\n and concepts and things like that.\n\n3:08:56.540 --> 3:08:58.740\n And so like to me, this kind of,\n\n3:08:58.740 --> 3:09:03.740\n so relationship is more like a commitment\n\n3:09:04.020 --> 3:09:09.020\n to one particular kind of object of your love.\n\n3:09:10.380 --> 3:09:12.800\n Like it's almost like a,\n\n3:09:12.800 --> 3:09:14.940\n it's like a journey that you take on together\n\n3:09:14.940 --> 3:09:18.020\n because also the interesting thing about humans\n\n3:09:18.020 --> 3:09:20.900\n is they're moment by moment a different person,\n\n3:09:20.900 --> 3:09:23.260\n day by day, week by week, month by month,\n\n3:09:23.260 --> 3:09:24.820\n they change, they evolve.\n\n3:09:24.820 --> 3:09:26.720\n There's an ups and downs and stuff like that.\n\n3:09:26.720 --> 3:09:29.140\n So what you're doing is you're saying,\n\n3:09:29.140 --> 3:09:31.380\n well, I'm going to explore all the ways\n\n3:09:31.380 --> 3:09:34.460\n that this human gets morphed and changed\n\n3:09:34.460 --> 3:09:38.500\n and what makes them cry, what makes them excited,\n\n3:09:38.500 --> 3:09:43.500\n what makes them lonely, like the habits,\n\n3:09:44.460 --> 3:09:47.180\n like when they form certain habits,\n\n3:09:47.180 --> 3:09:49.260\n how they feel when those habits are broken,\n\n3:09:49.260 --> 3:09:52.740\n like the stupid minute things that make everyday life,\n\n3:09:52.740 --> 3:09:54.900\n you're gonna be on that journey together\n\n3:09:54.900 --> 3:09:56.940\n figuring that out, just the way we're trying to figure\n\n3:09:56.940 --> 3:10:00.020\n ourselves out when we're like optimizing these things\n\n3:10:00.020 --> 3:10:01.460\n about diet and health and so on,\n\n3:10:01.460 --> 3:10:04.380\n you're kind of doing this computation together\n\n3:10:04.380 --> 3:10:06.980\n because neither person really understands themselves\n\n3:10:08.260 --> 3:10:11.260\n at all and you're together both confused about each other\n\n3:10:11.260 --> 3:10:15.620\n and you get to almost like a relationship is a chance\n\n3:10:16.620 --> 3:10:21.620\n to understand yourself and to understand another person,\n\n3:10:21.620 --> 3:10:25.860\n like together, that process is somewhat iterative.\n\n3:10:25.860 --> 3:10:27.180\n You know the dynamics, right?\n\n3:10:27.180 --> 3:10:29.300\n I mean, you're merging two nervous systems.\n\n3:10:29.300 --> 3:10:32.100\n This was once described to me very well by an ex girlfriend\n\n3:10:32.100 --> 3:10:35.320\n who's truly brilliant, she's really brilliant.\n\n3:10:36.980 --> 3:10:39.500\n She said, you know, there's four arrows.\n\n3:10:39.500 --> 3:10:42.980\n This is maybe to an engineer or like a, so it makes sense.\n\n3:10:42.980 --> 3:10:45.340\n There's how you feel towards the other person.\n\n3:10:45.340 --> 3:10:47.420\n There's how they feel towards you,\n\n3:10:47.420 --> 3:10:51.020\n but then there's an arrow that comes back to you,\n\n3:10:51.020 --> 3:10:54.940\n which is how you feel about how they feel.\n\n3:10:54.940 --> 3:10:56.720\n And then they have an arrow of how they feel\n\n3:10:56.720 --> 3:10:57.940\n about how you feel, right?\n\n3:10:57.940 --> 3:10:59.460\n This is why if someone else is moody\n\n3:10:59.460 --> 3:11:00.780\n or somebody else is upset,\n\n3:11:01.900 --> 3:11:05.020\n there's one version of ourselves where we respond to that\n\n3:11:05.020 --> 3:11:06.340\n or they respond to us,\n\n3:11:06.340 --> 3:11:09.580\n but there's another version where we respond to that,\n\n3:11:09.580 --> 3:11:12.660\n but it's also, there's a processing of what it means for us\n\n3:11:12.660 --> 3:11:15.460\n that they're behaving that way or feeling that way.\n\n3:11:15.460 --> 3:11:17.780\n And this again leads us back\n\n3:11:17.780 --> 3:11:19.300\n to that early attachment circuitry\n\n3:11:19.300 --> 3:11:22.900\n because if a parent was stressed,\n\n3:11:22.900 --> 3:11:25.860\n the child's role is not to soothe the parent.\n\n3:11:25.860 --> 3:11:27.500\n In fact, healthy models of parenting say\n\n3:11:27.500 --> 3:11:30.840\n that children shouldn't actually know how their parents feel\n\n3:11:30.840 --> 3:11:32.860\n for like the first eight years of their life.\n\n3:11:32.860 --> 3:11:34.420\n They're not supposed to be in that mindset\n\n3:11:34.420 --> 3:11:35.900\n of empathizing for the parent.\n\n3:11:35.900 --> 3:11:37.780\n This is often not the case,\n\n3:11:37.780 --> 3:11:40.080\n but maybe the cutoff isn't exactly eight,\n\n3:11:40.080 --> 3:11:41.240\n but you get the idea.\n\n3:11:41.240 --> 3:11:44.060\n So the dynamics of relationship are where the learning is\n\n3:11:44.060 --> 3:11:46.660\n because we learn how we react to other people reacting.\n\n3:11:46.660 --> 3:11:49.060\n It's not just a two arrow system.\n\n3:11:49.060 --> 3:11:51.140\n It's at least this four arrow thing.\n\n3:11:52.320 --> 3:11:54.900\n But there's also the element of nurturing, right?\n\n3:11:54.900 --> 3:11:57.860\n I mean, I think that going through life with somebody\n\n3:11:57.860 --> 3:12:00.140\n is so much better than going through it alone.\n\n3:12:00.140 --> 3:12:02.700\n And I'd never thought I'd make that statement.\n\n3:12:04.180 --> 3:12:05.860\n So it wasn't always obvious to you?\n\n3:12:05.860 --> 3:12:07.340\n No, it wasn't always obvious to me.\n\n3:12:07.340 --> 3:12:10.380\n I mean, I've really enjoyed wonderful relationships\n\n3:12:11.260 --> 3:12:12.540\n and some have been hard\n\n3:12:12.540 --> 3:12:14.500\n and there's certainly been a lot of growth.\n\n3:12:14.500 --> 3:12:18.940\n I'm on good terms with almost all my former girlfriends\n\n3:12:18.940 --> 3:12:21.960\n and close with some enough that I know their spouses\n\n3:12:21.960 --> 3:12:23.620\n and I'm close with their families.\n\n3:12:24.700 --> 3:12:25.740\n But no, it wasn't.\n\n3:12:25.740 --> 3:12:29.680\n And I think that when people say relationship is hard,\n\n3:12:29.680 --> 3:12:32.960\n the only really hard part of a good relationship\n\n3:12:32.960 --> 3:12:34.340\n is just dealing with oneself\n\n3:12:34.340 --> 3:12:35.540\n and making sure that you're staying\n\n3:12:35.540 --> 3:12:38.000\n in that mode of caretaking.\n\n3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:40.800\n Because I do believe that if one is mainly focused\n\n3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:42.700\n on taking good care of the other person,\n\n3:12:42.700 --> 3:12:46.400\n provided they're also focused on taking good care of you,\n\n3:12:46.400 --> 3:12:49.040\n to some extent, and we're good at taking care of ourselves,\n\n3:12:49.040 --> 3:12:51.040\n everybody flourishes, everything gets better.\n\n3:12:51.040 --> 3:12:52.940\n But no, I don't think I experienced that\n\n3:12:52.940 --> 3:12:54.880\n until fairly recently.\n\n3:12:54.880 --> 3:12:58.380\n What do you think is the secret\n\n3:12:58.380 --> 3:12:59.920\n to a successful relationship?\n\n3:13:02.900 --> 3:13:07.360\n There isn't just one, but at least in the top five\n\n3:13:07.360 --> 3:13:12.360\n is master or at least be good at autonomic self regulation.\n\n3:13:12.360 --> 3:13:16.300\n Be good at autonomic self regulation.\n\n3:13:16.300 --> 3:13:18.700\n Know how to calm yourself down.\n\n3:13:18.700 --> 3:13:21.700\n Don't expect the, like looking to anything external\n\n3:13:21.700 --> 3:13:24.720\n to soothe yourself is it puts you in a terrible position\n\n3:13:24.720 --> 3:13:27.700\n to be a caretaker of yourself and other people, right?\n\n3:13:27.700 --> 3:13:29.200\n So learn how to self soothe, right?\n\n3:13:29.200 --> 3:13:32.460\n Learn how to calm your mind, steady your actions,\n\n3:13:32.460 --> 3:13:33.500\n steady your voice.\n\n3:13:33.500 --> 3:13:34.420\n There are tools to do that.\n\n3:13:34.420 --> 3:13:35.900\n We talk about on the podcast, but elsewhere,\n\n3:13:35.900 --> 3:13:36.900\n have that in place.\n\n3:13:36.900 --> 3:13:41.900\n I also think that if your main focus is on,\n\n3:13:41.900 --> 3:13:43.860\n you want to have a good boundaries, et cetera,\n\n3:13:43.860 --> 3:13:46.420\n but on tending to the relationship,\n\n3:13:46.420 --> 3:13:48.540\n doing a little bit more than you think you ought to do,\n\n3:13:48.540 --> 3:13:50.740\n if everyone does that, it goes great.\n\n3:13:50.740 --> 3:13:52.880\n I mean, I'm sometimes so positively struck\n\n3:13:52.880 --> 3:13:57.840\n by how supported I feel because for many years,\n\n3:13:57.840 --> 3:13:59.620\n I was just kind of doing everything on my own.\n\n3:13:59.620 --> 3:14:01.180\n So any little thing, I'm like, oh my goodness,\n\n3:14:01.180 --> 3:14:02.780\n this feels huge.\n\n3:14:02.780 --> 3:14:04.980\n And also I think the dynamics have to be right.\n\n3:14:04.980 --> 3:14:05.860\n Let's be really honest.\n\n3:14:05.860 --> 3:14:07.500\n This is a little bit of a tricky topic,\n\n3:14:07.500 --> 3:14:12.500\n but there is a power dynamic in relationships.\n\n3:14:13.460 --> 3:14:16.400\n Sometimes, not all, but in some relationships,\n\n3:14:16.400 --> 3:14:18.500\n it works much better if one person leads\n\n3:14:18.500 --> 3:14:21.100\n and the other person follows.\n\n3:14:21.100 --> 3:14:24.820\n In other relationships, it's more mutuality, works best.\n\n3:14:24.820 --> 3:14:26.880\n People need to know what they need.\n\n3:14:26.880 --> 3:14:29.300\n And so knowing what you need and what you crave\n\n3:14:29.300 --> 3:14:30.260\n is really important.\n\n3:14:30.260 --> 3:14:31.100\n And then once you do that,\n\n3:14:31.100 --> 3:14:33.400\n you can create the relationship you want.\n\n3:14:33.400 --> 3:14:34.760\n I've seen that over and over again.\n\n3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:36.020\n And people are different.\n\n3:14:36.020 --> 3:14:41.020\n But I think that ultimately, I mean, right,\n\n3:14:41.300 --> 3:14:44.740\n there's the dopamine phase of a relationship.\n\n3:14:44.740 --> 3:14:46.140\n And then there's the serotonin phase,\n\n3:14:46.140 --> 3:14:49.020\n the kind of more mutuality, coziness and sweetness.\n\n3:14:49.020 --> 3:14:52.220\n There's a great book about how to make sure\n\n3:14:52.220 --> 3:14:56.460\n that the dopamine component and the serotonin component,\n\n3:14:56.460 --> 3:14:58.540\n so to speak, go on forever.\n\n3:14:58.540 --> 3:14:59.780\n And it has to do with, you know,\n\n3:14:59.780 --> 3:15:01.400\n when you first meet someone and you're attracted to them,\n\n3:15:01.400 --> 3:15:04.500\n you're essentially objectifying them,\n\n3:15:04.500 --> 3:15:07.100\n meaning not in the way people might think,\n\n3:15:07.100 --> 3:15:09.500\n you are not dependent on them\n\n3:15:09.500 --> 3:15:11.700\n for emotional stability or survival.\n\n3:15:11.700 --> 3:15:12.860\n As you get close to somebody,\n\n3:15:12.860 --> 3:15:14.820\n you really come to depend on them\n\n3:15:14.820 --> 3:15:16.500\n and then you tend to objectify them less.\n\n3:15:16.500 --> 3:15:18.820\n And so this book, the name is kind of corny,\n\n3:15:18.820 --> 3:15:20.280\n but it's written by an analyst again,\n\n3:15:20.280 --> 3:15:21.620\n it's called Can Love Last?\n\n3:15:21.620 --> 3:15:26.260\n And it's a book about how really good, strong relationships\n\n3:15:26.260 --> 3:15:28.560\n are the consequence of people constantly moving\n\n3:15:28.560 --> 3:15:33.260\n through this dependency objectification dynamic.\n\n3:15:33.260 --> 3:15:37.060\n And I use those words in the psychological sense,\n\n3:15:37.060 --> 3:15:39.100\n not in the way they're typically thrown around nowadays.\n\n3:15:39.100 --> 3:15:41.940\n So in some cultures,\n\n3:15:41.940 --> 3:15:45.020\n men and women will only touch\n\n3:15:45.020 --> 3:15:46.900\n for two weeks out of the month.\n\n3:15:46.900 --> 3:15:48.580\n And then for the other two weeks,\n\n3:15:49.500 --> 3:15:52.540\n the excitement and the sensuality and all,\n\n3:15:52.540 --> 3:15:54.660\n and the sexuality is very heightened.\n\n3:15:54.660 --> 3:15:56.460\n And then they go back to this kind of distancing.\n\n3:15:56.460 --> 3:15:58.660\n Now, I don't think that's feasible for most people,\n\n3:15:58.660 --> 3:16:00.200\n but if you look statistically,\n\n3:16:00.200 --> 3:16:02.900\n those relationships tend to last a very long time\n\n3:16:02.900 --> 3:16:05.940\n with at least reported mutual feelings\n\n3:16:05.940 --> 3:16:10.500\n of intense attraction for many, many, many decades.\n\n3:16:10.500 --> 3:16:14.660\n So human beings need to learn how to at least understand\n\n3:16:14.660 --> 3:16:16.060\n and control these dynamics.\n\n3:16:16.060 --> 3:16:17.860\n And there's a lot of divorce, there's a lot of cheating,\n\n3:16:17.860 --> 3:16:18.860\n there's a lot of stuff out there.\n\n3:16:18.860 --> 3:16:20.900\n It'd be great if people could resolve some of this stuff\n\n3:16:20.900 --> 3:16:23.060\n inside of the relationship, in my opinion.\n\n3:16:24.260 --> 3:16:26.860\n Yeah, and this kind of intense attraction,\n\n3:16:26.860 --> 3:16:31.860\n there's actually one of the poems\n\n3:16:32.900 --> 3:16:36.020\n that Karl Deisseroth introduced me to.\n\n3:16:36.020 --> 3:16:38.340\n I think it's Two English Poems is the name.\n\n3:16:38.340 --> 3:16:41.960\n But one of the things I find myself\n\n3:16:41.960 --> 3:16:45.020\n for prolonged periods being attracted to\n\n3:16:45.900 --> 3:16:49.780\n is you notice some kind of magic\n\n3:16:50.640 --> 3:16:55.640\n and you keep wanting to dig to the depths of that magic.\n\n3:16:55.640 --> 3:16:57.800\n You need to really know that person.\n\n3:16:57.800 --> 3:17:00.360\n To really know a person deeply, yeah.\n\n3:17:00.360 --> 3:17:03.400\n You notice something early on.\n\n3:17:03.400 --> 3:17:04.500\n I don't know what that is,\n\n3:17:04.500 --> 3:17:06.640\n but you just notice something special\n\n3:17:06.640 --> 3:17:09.080\n and you want to keep pulling at that thread\n\n3:17:09.080 --> 3:17:10.640\n and you never really do.\n\n3:17:10.640 --> 3:17:12.040\n Well, you also have to be careful.\n\n3:17:12.040 --> 3:17:13.600\n I get a lot of questions from guys.\n\n3:17:13.600 --> 3:17:15.060\n You have to be careful the questions you ask\n\n3:17:15.060 --> 3:17:16.400\n in a relationship too.\n\n3:17:16.400 --> 3:17:18.400\n You have to make sure you really want that information.\n\n3:17:18.400 --> 3:17:20.080\n And it's not just about people's past, right?\n\n3:17:20.080 --> 3:17:21.800\n If you ask somebody how they really feel\n\n3:17:21.800 --> 3:17:24.680\n about something about you and they tell you,\n\n3:17:24.680 --> 3:17:25.960\n that may be soothing.\n\n3:17:25.960 --> 3:17:27.900\n It may be intensely stressful.\n\n3:17:27.900 --> 3:17:31.240\n You have to be, here's one thing I know for sure.\n\n3:17:31.240 --> 3:17:34.020\n For a relationship to work, you have to be brave.\n\n3:17:34.900 --> 3:17:37.480\n You can't go in there fully protected.\n\n3:17:37.480 --> 3:17:39.680\n And yet you also can't go in there with no boundaries\n\n3:17:39.680 --> 3:17:42.240\n because you'll end up beat up.\n\n3:17:42.240 --> 3:17:43.260\n What's that quote?\n\n3:17:43.260 --> 3:17:45.160\n If you want to be a warrior, prepare to get hurt.\n\n3:17:45.160 --> 3:17:47.280\n If you want to be an explorer, prepare to get lost.\n\n3:17:47.280 --> 3:17:49.440\n And if you want to be both, you know,\n\n3:17:49.440 --> 3:17:52.080\n if you become a lover, prepare to be both or something.\n\n3:17:52.080 --> 3:17:52.920\n Something like that.\n\n3:17:52.920 --> 3:17:55.080\n I forget, this is one of these Instagram type things\n\n3:17:55.080 --> 3:17:56.880\n that you see passing by and you go, oh, that's pretty true.\n\n3:17:56.880 --> 3:17:59.920\n Love is scary because it takes us back\n\n3:17:59.920 --> 3:18:03.000\n to that primitive circuitry that is as primitive\n\n3:18:03.000 --> 3:18:05.820\n and basic as hunger, thirst, the desire for heat\n\n3:18:05.820 --> 3:18:10.040\n when we're cold, the desire for cold when we're overly warm.\n\n3:18:10.040 --> 3:18:11.940\n It's a, it's Dynorphin.\n\n3:18:11.940 --> 3:18:14.600\n I mean, when somebody leaves, like the, you know,\n\n3:18:14.600 --> 3:18:17.880\n when somebody you are attached to leaves by death\n\n3:18:17.880 --> 3:18:20.680\n or by decision or you're forced apart,\n\n3:18:20.680 --> 3:18:23.160\n the Dynorphin release is massive.\n\n3:18:23.160 --> 3:18:24.520\n It is true discomfort.\n\n3:18:24.520 --> 3:18:27.760\n People feel anxiety and discomfort.\n\n3:18:27.760 --> 3:18:30.240\n And moving through that is a hell of a process.\n\n3:18:30.240 --> 3:18:32.820\n I mean, if I knew how to best break up\n\n3:18:32.820 --> 3:18:34.520\n at a neurological level,\n\n3:18:34.520 --> 3:18:37.200\n or if you could just plug yourself into a wall and reset,\n\n3:18:37.200 --> 3:18:39.400\n I mean, I'd do that episode tomorrow,\n\n3:18:39.400 --> 3:18:41.360\n but we don't have that knowledge.\n\n3:18:41.360 --> 3:18:44.100\n Come on, I think we've covered this before\n\n3:18:44.100 --> 3:18:45.840\n and it's even been memeified.\n\n3:18:45.840 --> 3:18:49.560\n I think losing love is part of the magic of love.\n\n3:18:49.560 --> 3:18:51.480\n It means you've felt something.\n\n3:18:51.480 --> 3:18:52.880\n I agree, but at some point,\n\n3:18:52.880 --> 3:18:54.720\n like if you've done it enough times,\n\n3:18:54.720 --> 3:18:57.480\n you know, life is finite, you know.\n\n3:18:57.480 --> 3:18:59.840\n It is beautiful to see these couples\n\n3:18:59.840 --> 3:19:04.840\n that seem very much in love despite many years,\n\n3:19:04.960 --> 3:19:06.640\n despite having been together many years.\n\n3:19:06.640 --> 3:19:08.400\n Yeah, the way they look at each other.\n\n3:19:08.400 --> 3:19:09.240\n Yeah, they'll say.\n\n3:19:09.240 --> 3:19:10.200\n They still see the magic.\n\n3:19:10.200 --> 3:19:11.920\n Yeah, and they'll say, we got lucky\n\n3:19:11.920 --> 3:19:14.120\n or it was, it's been hard or this and that.\n\n3:19:14.120 --> 3:19:18.560\n I think external conditions being a little tougher\n\n3:19:18.560 --> 3:19:20.640\n is helpful for a couple.\n\n3:19:20.640 --> 3:19:21.480\n Hardship.\n\n3:19:21.480 --> 3:19:24.720\n I do, I do, because I think that you rally, you know,\n\n3:19:24.720 --> 3:19:26.560\n and you bond with people, you know,\n\n3:19:26.560 --> 3:19:29.200\n obviously you want to survive those conditions,\n\n3:19:29.200 --> 3:19:31.640\n but yeah, I do.\n\n3:19:31.640 --> 3:19:32.480\n I think that it helps.\n\n3:19:32.480 --> 3:19:33.760\n Bonnie and Clyde.\n\n3:19:33.760 --> 3:19:34.600\n So any.\n\n3:19:34.600 --> 3:19:35.760\n Well, they were a little.\n\n3:19:35.760 --> 3:19:37.480\n Oh, a little too much.\n\n3:19:37.480 --> 3:19:38.800\n Well, a little too much.\n\n3:19:38.800 --> 3:19:41.080\n They were sociopaths, but the,\n\n3:19:41.080 --> 3:19:42.720\n well, when two sociopaths find one.\n\n3:19:42.720 --> 3:19:44.120\n Love can make you do crazy things.\n\n3:19:44.120 --> 3:19:45.060\n Normally, it's interesting,\n\n3:19:45.060 --> 3:19:47.560\n normally sociopaths don't team up\n\n3:19:47.560 --> 3:19:50.080\n because they manipulate each other.\n\n3:19:50.080 --> 3:19:53.500\n Sociopaths sadly are usually only interested\n\n3:19:53.500 --> 3:19:56.920\n in manipulating the highly pliable or unsuspecting,\n\n3:19:58.480 --> 3:20:01.860\n but when romantic attraction is woven in,\n\n3:20:01.860 --> 3:20:05.440\n then it gets really diabolical.\n\n3:20:05.440 --> 3:20:09.440\n Any advice on finding the love of your life, of my life?\n\n3:20:09.440 --> 3:20:12.360\n This is, why Lexus single response?\n\n3:20:12.360 --> 3:20:13.640\n Why, any advice?\n\n3:20:15.460 --> 3:20:17.320\n Yeah, actually this comes from a friend of mine\n\n3:20:17.320 --> 3:20:19.680\n who's in a really excellent marriage\n\n3:20:19.680 --> 3:20:23.360\n with great kids and family and high demand life.\n\n3:20:24.440 --> 3:20:25.600\n It's a decision.\n\n3:20:25.600 --> 3:20:28.600\n Like at some point you just prioritize it as,\n\n3:20:28.600 --> 3:20:33.340\n okay, I'm going to make this happen one way or another.\n\n3:20:33.340 --> 3:20:36.560\n And you don't force the discovery of that person.\n\n3:20:36.560 --> 3:20:38.800\n But I mean, I've occasionally said,\n\n3:20:38.800 --> 3:20:41.020\n hey, I think you should meet this person or that person.\n\n3:20:41.020 --> 3:20:44.520\n And well, it wasn't, maybe my judgment\n\n3:20:44.520 --> 3:20:47.160\n might've been off, but the timing wasn't right or something.\n\n3:20:47.160 --> 3:20:49.960\n But I think that, yeah, it's a decision.\n\n3:20:49.960 --> 3:20:52.160\n And it also has to do with life structure.\n\n3:20:52.160 --> 3:20:53.000\n I mean, there were years.\n\n3:20:53.000 --> 3:20:54.880\n So when I was in graduate school,\n\n3:20:54.880 --> 3:20:56.360\n I didn't want a girlfriend.\n\n3:20:56.360 --> 3:20:57.600\n I just wanted to be in lab.\n\n3:20:57.600 --> 3:21:00.620\n And I, sure I had romantic dating interests,\n\n3:21:00.620 --> 3:21:02.800\n but I wasn't going to meet them through a committed,\n\n3:21:02.800 --> 3:21:04.400\n live together situation.\n\n3:21:04.400 --> 3:21:05.720\n It wasn't where I was at.\n\n3:21:05.720 --> 3:21:07.360\n And as a postdoc, things were a little different,\n\n3:21:07.360 --> 3:21:08.200\n et cetera, et cetera.\n\n3:21:08.200 --> 3:21:09.880\n So, but at some point it's sort of like,\n\n3:21:09.880 --> 3:21:12.440\n what do I want my daily routine to look like?\n\n3:21:12.440 --> 3:21:16.240\n Because ultimately a relationship, however one structures,\n\n3:21:16.240 --> 3:21:18.120\n is going to be part of your daily routine.\n\n3:21:18.120 --> 3:21:19.400\n So at the point where you're like,\n\n3:21:19.400 --> 3:21:21.720\n I'd really love to wake up next to somebody\n\n3:21:21.720 --> 3:21:23.960\n and do blank and blank together.\n\n3:21:23.960 --> 3:21:27.620\n And then I'd love to work and then we meet for dinner.\n\n3:21:27.620 --> 3:21:30.080\n And then we take the dog for a walk or take kids out\n\n3:21:30.080 --> 3:21:32.960\n or whatever it happens to be, take a trip.\n\n3:21:32.960 --> 3:21:35.680\n You have to be, one has to be in the mindset\n\n3:21:35.680 --> 3:21:38.760\n of wanting to do couple like things.\n\n3:21:38.760 --> 3:21:40.480\n And a lot of people don't think about it that way.\n\n3:21:40.480 --> 3:21:43.200\n They either fall into something\n\n3:21:43.200 --> 3:21:48.200\n or they don't see the benefits of coupling up.\n\n3:21:48.400 --> 3:21:52.240\n I think that the pandemic tuned people's awareness\n\n3:21:52.240 --> 3:21:57.000\n to the fact that some things are indeed easier on your own,\n\n3:21:57.920 --> 3:21:59.680\n depends on finances, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n3:21:59.680 --> 3:22:04.680\n But a lot of things are made better done with other people.\n\n3:22:05.680 --> 3:22:10.560\n 100%, but I also, so I was very deliberately,\n\n3:22:10.560 --> 3:22:13.320\n it's an interesting way to put it,\n\n3:22:13.320 --> 3:22:15.400\n but what do you want your day to look like?\n\n3:22:15.400 --> 3:22:17.240\n I think what do you want your day to look like?\n\n3:22:17.240 --> 3:22:18.680\n What do you want your life to be?\n\n3:22:18.680 --> 3:22:23.000\n I was very deliberately always, first of all,\n\n3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:27.280\n happy to be alone, like a conscious thinking.\n\n3:22:27.280 --> 3:22:31.200\n I know a lot of friends were just unable to be alone.\n\n3:22:31.200 --> 3:22:34.340\n I'm able to be alone, but I'm much happier\n\n3:22:34.340 --> 3:22:35.760\n with another person.\n\n3:22:35.760 --> 3:22:39.600\n Like I'm able to share joy with other humans.\n\n3:22:39.600 --> 3:22:43.520\n I look forward to the day that our kids are rolling jiu jitsu\n\n3:22:43.520 --> 3:22:47.120\n and my kids are hanging out with your kids.\n\n3:22:47.120 --> 3:22:52.120\n And if that notion sounds even remotely interesting\n\n3:22:53.440 --> 3:22:56.200\n and fun, then it's sort of like you kind of backpedal\n\n3:22:56.200 --> 3:22:57.680\n from that and you go, well, it has to happen.\n\n3:22:57.680 --> 3:23:00.760\n How do you get to reverse engineer\n\n3:23:00.760 --> 3:23:03.920\n and think from first principles about love?\n\n3:23:03.920 --> 3:23:06.960\n Andrew, thank you for being my friend.\n\n3:23:06.960 --> 3:23:08.560\n Thank you for being an amazing human being\n\n3:23:08.560 --> 3:23:11.640\n who's so inspiring to so many people for constantly.\n\n3:23:11.640 --> 3:23:13.600\n I told this to Carl, like one of the things\n\n3:23:13.600 --> 3:23:18.600\n that was really refreshing about you is that\n\n3:23:21.800 --> 3:23:23.960\n when I tell you an idea and I tell you a thought,\n\n3:23:23.960 --> 3:23:25.760\n when I tell you something,\n\n3:23:25.760 --> 3:23:29.120\n you don't shut it down as a first step.\n\n3:23:29.120 --> 3:23:31.320\n I was saying that that's common in the scientific community.\n\n3:23:31.320 --> 3:23:32.960\n That's common in people around you.\n\n3:23:32.960 --> 3:23:34.720\n You're seeing what's the goal there.\n\n3:23:34.720 --> 3:23:37.000\n You get excited, get excited together.\n\n3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:40.520\n And that's how you can really have a great friendship\n\n3:23:40.520 --> 3:23:43.520\n and do great stuff together.\n\n3:23:43.520 --> 3:23:45.320\n So I'm deeply grateful for that.\n\n3:23:45.320 --> 3:23:50.200\n And just for connecting so many interesting people together.\n\n3:23:50.200 --> 3:23:51.840\n You're doing an amazing job, man.\n\n3:23:51.840 --> 3:23:53.720\n And thank you for existing.\n\n3:23:53.720 --> 3:23:54.920\n Thank you for being you.\n\n3:23:54.920 --> 3:23:56.280\n Thank you for talking today.\n\n3:23:56.280 --> 3:23:59.960\n And next time I'll see you in the sauna and ice bath.\n\n3:23:59.960 --> 3:24:01.200\n Well, I wanna say several things.\n\n3:24:01.200 --> 3:24:03.040\n First of all, thank you for having me on again.\n\n3:24:03.040 --> 3:24:04.520\n It's an honor and a pleasure.\n\n3:24:04.520 --> 3:24:07.640\n And I don't say that formally, I really truly mean it.\n\n3:24:07.640 --> 3:24:10.120\n I only, the Huberman Lab Podcast, as I always say,\n\n3:24:10.120 --> 3:24:12.640\n only exists because you gave me the suggestion\n\n3:24:12.640 --> 3:24:14.920\n and I'm so grateful that you did.\n\n3:24:14.920 --> 3:24:15.960\n So thank you.\n\n3:24:15.960 --> 3:24:19.440\n And for doing what you do, like you are brave\n\n3:24:19.440 --> 3:24:20.760\n and you were first man in\n\n3:24:20.760 --> 3:24:22.680\n and you're just continuing to do it.\n\n3:24:22.680 --> 3:24:24.720\n As my postdoc advisor used to say,\n\n3:24:24.720 --> 3:24:27.480\n whatever you're doing, just keep going.\n\n3:24:27.480 --> 3:24:28.880\n And then in terms of our friendship,\n\n3:24:28.880 --> 3:24:32.960\n I mean, I think you know, and if you don't,\n\n3:24:32.960 --> 3:24:34.280\n I'm gonna just keep telling you anyway,\n\n3:24:34.280 --> 3:24:37.240\n by texting in person, you're an amazing friend.\n\n3:24:37.240 --> 3:24:40.560\n There's deep trust, there's immense respect\n\n3:24:40.560 --> 3:24:42.920\n and I love you, brother.\n\n3:24:42.920 --> 3:24:44.480\n I love you too, man.\n\n3:24:44.480 --> 3:24:46.040\n We did it.\n\n3:24:46.040 --> 3:24:47.440\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n3:24:47.440 --> 3:24:48.720\n with Andrew Huberman.\n\n3:24:48.720 --> 3:24:50.000\n To support this podcast,\n\n3:24:50.000 -->

Emerson.\n\n3:24:57.000 --> 3:24:59.600\n It is one of the blessings of old friends.\n\n3:24:59.600 --> 3:25:02.440\n You can afford to be stupid with them.\n\n3:25:02.440 --> 3:25:04.840\n I look forward to doing just that\n\n3:25:04.840 --> 3:25:06.640\n in the many years to come\n\n3:25:06.640 --> 3:25:09.680\n of friendship and fun conversations with Andrew.\n\n3:25:09.680 --> 3:25:32.680\n
