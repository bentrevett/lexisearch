00:10.600\n that manages a $2 billion dual currency investment fund\n\n00:10.600 --> 00:13.160\n with a focus on developing the next generation\n\n00:13.160 --> 00:15.440\n of Chinese high tech companies.\n\n00:15.440 --> 00:17.880\n He's the former president of Google China\n\n00:17.880 --> 00:19.800\n and the founder of what is now called\n\n00:19.800 --> 00:21.680\n Microsoft Research Asia,\n\n00:21.680 --> 00:24.920\n an institute that trained many of the artificial\n\n00:24.920 --> 00:26.520\n intelligence leaders in China,\n\n00:26.520 --> 00:30.280\n including CTOs or AI execs at Baidu,\n\n00:30.280 --> 00:33.920\n Tencent, Alibaba, Lenovo, and Huawei.\n\n00:34.840 --> 00:38.520\n He was named one of the 100 most influential people\n\n00:38.520 --> 00:40.480\n in the world by Time Magazine.\n\n00:40.480 --> 00:43.840\n He's the author of seven bestselling books in Chinese\n\n00:43.840 --> 00:46.680\n and most recently, the New York Times bestseller\n\n00:46.680 --> 00:50.600\n called AI Superpowers, China, Silicon Valley,\n\n00:50.600 --> 00:52.600\n and the New World Order.\n\n00:52.600 --> 00:55.760\n He has unparalleled experience\n\n00:55.760 --> 00:57.640\n in working across major tech companies\n\n00:57.640 --> 01:00.040\n and governments and applications of AI,\n\n01:00.040 --> 01:03.440\n and so he has a unique perspective on global innovation\n\n01:03.440 --> 01:06.200\n and the future of AI that I think is important\n\n01:06.200 --> 01:08.880\n to listen to and think about.\n\n01:08.880 --> 01:11.880\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:11.880 --> 01:15.160\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube and iTunes,\n\n01:15.160 --> 01:17.920\n support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me\n\n01:17.920 --> 01:20.960\n on Twitter at Lex Friedman.\n\n01:20.960 --> 01:25.960\n And now, here's my conversation with Kaifu Li.\n\n01:26.040 --> 01:29.360\n I immigrated from Russia to US when I was 13.\n\n01:29.360 --> 01:32.400\n You immigrated to US at about the same age.\n\n01:32.400 --> 01:34.720\n The Russian people, the American people,\n\n01:34.720 --> 01:38.240\n the Chinese people each have a certain soul,\n\n01:38.240 --> 01:42.000\n a spirit that permeates throughout the generations.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:45.080\n So maybe it's a little bit of a poetic question,\n\n01:45.080 --> 01:48.840\n but could you describe your sense\n\n01:48.840 --> 01:52.000\n of what defines the Chinese soul?\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:56.080\n I think the Chinese soul of people today, right,\n\n01:56.080 --> 02:01.080\n we're talking about people who have had centuries of burden\n\n02:01.920 --> 02:05.120\n because of the poverty that the country has gone through,\n\n02:05.120 --> 02:10.120\n and suddenly shined with hope of prosperity\n\n02:10.480 --> 02:13.360\n in the past 40 years as China opened up\n\n02:13.360 --> 02:15.400\n and embraced market economy.\n\n02:15.400 --> 02:20.160\n And undoubtedly, there are two sets of pressures\n\n02:20.160 --> 02:24.120\n on the people, that of the tradition,\n\n02:24.120 --> 02:28.000\n that of facing difficult situations,\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:31.120\n and that of hope of wanting to be the first\n\n02:31.120 --> 02:33.840\n to become successful and wealthy.\n\n02:33.840 --> 02:38.320\n So that's a very strong hunger and a strong desire\n\n02:38.320 --> 02:41.120\n and strong work ethic that drives China forward.\n\n02:41.120 --> 02:43.920\n And is there roots to not just this generation,\n\n02:43.920 --> 02:47.280\n but before that's deeper\n\n02:47.280 --> 02:50.080\n than just the new economic developments?\n\n02:50.080 --> 02:52.520\n Is there something that's unique to China\n\n02:52.520 --> 02:54.960\n that you could speak to that's in the people?\n\n02:54.960 --> 02:58.560\n Yeah, well, the Chinese tradition\n\n02:58.560 --> 03:02.640\n is about excellence, dedication, and results.\n\n03:02.640 --> 03:07.200\n And the Chinese exams and study subjects in schools\n\n03:07.200 --> 03:09.120\n have traditionally started\n\n03:09.120 --> 03:11.080\n from memorizing 10,000 characters,\n\n03:11.080 --> 03:13.560\n not an easy task to start with.\n\n03:13.560 --> 03:15.120\n And further by memorizing\n\n03:15.120 --> 03:18.960\n his historic philosopher's literature poetry.\n\n03:18.960 --> 03:21.080\n So it really is probably\n\n03:21.080 --> 03:25.040\n the strongest rote learning mechanism created\n\n03:25.040 --> 03:26.920\n to make sure people had good memory\n\n03:26.920 --> 03:29.120\n and remember things extremely well.\n\n03:30.080 --> 03:32.680\n That's, I think at the same time,\n\n03:32.680 --> 03:36.120\n suppresses the breakthrough innovation\n\n03:37.360 --> 03:42.360\n and also enhances the speed execution get results.\n\n03:42.360 --> 03:44.400\n And that I think characterizes\n\n03:44.400 --> 03:47.280\n the historic basis of China.\n\n03:47.280 --> 03:48.120\n That's interesting,\n\n03:48.120 --> 03:50.200\n because there's echoes of that in Russian education\n\n03:50.200 --> 03:51.960\n as well as rote memorization.\n\n03:51.960 --> 03:53.680\n So you have to memorize a lot of poetry.\n\n03:53.680 --> 03:58.680\n I mean, there's just an emphasis on perfection in all forms\n\n03:59.120 --> 04:02.120\n that's not conducive to perhaps what you're speaking to,\n\n04:02.120 --> 04:03.560\n which is creativity.\n\n04:03.560 --> 04:06.880\n But you think that kind of education holds back\n\n04:06.880 --> 04:09.400\n the innovative spirit that you might see\n\n04:09.400 --> 04:10.840\n in the United States?\n\n04:10.840 --> 04:14.720\n Well, it holds back the breakthrough innovative spirits\n\n04:14.720 --> 04:16.360\n that we see in the United States,\n\n04:16.360 --> 04:21.360\n but it does not hold back the valuable execution oriented,\n\n04:21.760 --> 04:25.120\n result oriented value creating engines,\n\n04:25.120 --> 04:27.840\n which we see China being very successful.\n\n04:27.840 --> 04:32.760\n So is there a difference between a Chinese AI engineer today\n\n04:32.760 --> 04:34.680\n and an American AI engineer,\n\n04:34.680 --> 04:36.920\n perhaps rooted in the culture that we just talked about\n\n04:36.920 --> 04:41.040\n or the education or the very soul of the people or no?\n\n04:41.040 --> 04:43.600\n And what would your advice be to each\n\n04:43.600 --> 04:45.400\n if there's a difference?\n\n04:45.400 --> 04:47.000\n Well, there's a lot that's similar\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:51.120\n because AI is about mastering sciences,\n\n04:51.120 --> 04:54.760\n about using known technologies and trying new things,\n\n04:54.760 --> 04:58.120\n but it's also about picking from many parts\n\n04:58.120 --> 05:00.160\n of possible networks to use\n\n05:00.160 --> 05:02.800\n and different types of parameters to tune.\n\n05:02.800 --> 05:05.200\n And that part is somewhat rote.\n\n05:05.200 --> 05:08.880\n And it is also, as anyone who's built AI products\n\n05:08.880 --> 05:12.560\n can tell you a lot about cleansing the data\n\n05:12.560 --> 05:15.080\n because AI runs better with more data\n\n05:15.080 --> 05:18.480\n and data is generally unstructured,\n\n05:18.480 --> 05:22.280\n errorful and unclean.\n\n05:22.280 --> 05:26.160\n And the effort to clean the data is immense.\n\n05:26.160 --> 05:31.160\n So I think the better part of American engineering,\n\n05:31.160 --> 05:35.520\n AI engineering process is to try new things,\n\n05:35.520 --> 05:37.960\n to do things people haven't done before\n\n05:37.960 --> 05:42.960\n and to use technology to solve most if not all problems.\n\n05:43.360 --> 05:47.120\n So to make the algorithm work despite not so great data,\n\n05:47.120 --> 05:50.640\n find error tolerant ways to deal with the data.\n\n05:50.640 --> 05:55.640\n The Chinese way would be to basically enumerate\n\n05:55.920 --> 05:58.560\n to the fullest extent all the possible ways\n\n05:58.560 --> 06:01.000\n by a lot of machines, try lots of different ways\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:04.560\n to get it to work and spend a lot of resources\n\n06:04.560 --> 06:07.680\n and money and time cleaning up data.\n\n06:07.680 --> 06:10.960\n That means the AI engineer may be writing\n\n06:10.960 --> 06:15.560\n data cleansing algorithms, working with thousands of people\n\n06:15.560 --> 06:19.120\n who label or correct or do things with the data.\n\n06:19.120 --> 06:21.680\n That is the incredible hard work\n\n06:21.680 --> 06:23.960\n that might lead to better results.\n\n06:23.960 --> 06:26.360\n So the Chinese engineer would rely on\n\n06:26.360 --> 06:29.040\n and ask for more and more and more data\n\n06:29.040 --> 06:31.440\n and find ways to cleanse them and make them work\n\n06:31.440 --> 06:34.480\n in the system and probably less time thinking\n\n06:34.480 --> 06:38.520\n about new algorithms that can overcome data\n\n06:38.520 --> 06:39.640\n or other issues.\n\n06:39.640 --> 06:40.840\n So where's your intuition?\n\n06:40.840 --> 06:42.320\n Where do you think the biggest impact\n\n06:42.320 --> 06:44.160\n in the next 10 years lies?\n\n06:44.160 --> 06:46.480\n Is it in some breakthrough algorithms\n\n06:47.360 --> 06:52.360\n or is it in just this at scale rigor,\n\n06:53.160 --> 06:55.920\n a rigorous approach to data, cleaning data,\n\n06:55.920 --> 06:58.440\n organizing data onto the same algorithms?\n\n06:58.440 --> 07:02.600\n What do you think the big impact in the applied world is?\n\n07:02.600 --> 07:04.560\n Well, if you're really in the company\n\n07:04.560 --> 07:06.880\n and you have to deliver results,\n\n07:06.880 --> 07:09.720\n using known techniques and enhancing data\n\n07:09.720 --> 07:12.240\n seems like the more expedient approach\n\n07:12.240 --> 07:15.680\n that's very low risk and likely to generate\n\n07:15.680 --> 07:17.200\n better and better results.\n\n07:17.200 --> 07:20.520\n And that's why the Chinese approach has done quite well.\n\n07:20.520 --> 07:24.280\n Now, there are a lot of more challenging startups\n\n07:24.280 --> 07:28.480\n and problems such as autonomous vehicles,\n\n07:28.480 --> 07:32.080\n medical diagnosis that existing algorithms\n\n07:32.080 --> 07:34.280\n probably won't solve.\n\n07:34.280 --> 07:38.720\n And that would put the Chinese approach more challenged\n\n07:38.720 --> 07:42.400\n and give them more breakthrough innovation approach,\n\n07:42.400 --> 07:45.440\n more of an edge on those kinds of problems.\n\n07:45.440 --> 07:47.080\n So let me talk to that a little more.\n\n07:47.080 --> 07:51.000\n So my intuition personally is that data\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.680\n can take us extremely far.\n\n07:53.680 --> 07:56.480\n So you brought up autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis.\n\n07:56.480 --> 08:00.080\n So your intuition is that huge amounts of data\n\n08:00.080 --> 08:04.000\n might not be able to completely help us solve that problem.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:08.080\n Right, so breaking that down further in autonomous vehicle,\n\n08:08.080 --> 08:11.280\n I think huge amounts of data probably will solve\n\n08:11.280 --> 08:13.000\n trucks driving on highways,\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.600\n which will deliver a significant value\n\n08:15.600 --> 08:18.120\n and China will probably lead in that.\n\n08:18.120 --> 08:23.120\n And full L5 autonomous is likely to require\n\n08:23.960 --> 08:26.320\n new technologies we don't yet know.\n\n08:26.320 --> 08:28.640\n And that might require academia\n\n08:28.640 --> 08:30.360\n and great industrial research,\n\n08:30.360 --> 08:32.480\n both innovating and working together.\n\n08:32.480 --> 08:35.360\n And in that case, US has an advantage.\n\n08:35.360 --> 08:37.200\n So the interesting question there is,\n\n08:37.200 --> 08:38.240\n I don't know if you're familiar\n\n08:38.240 --> 08:39.720\n on the autonomous vehicle space\n\n08:39.720 --> 08:42.640\n and the developments with Tesla and Elon Musk.\n\n08:42.640 --> 08:43.480\n I am.\n\n08:43.480 --> 08:48.080\n Where they are in fact full steam ahead\n\n08:49.400 --> 08:53.480\n into this mysterious complex world of full autonomy, L5,\n\n08:53.480 --> 08:58.480\n L4, L5, and they're trying to solve that purely with data.\n\n08:58.800 --> 09:00.800\n So the same kind of thing that you're saying\n\n09:00.800 --> 09:02.080\n is just for highway,\n\n09:02.080 --> 09:05.320\n which is what a lot of people share your intuition.\n\n09:05.320 --> 09:07.200\n They're trying to solve with data.\n\n09:07.200 --> 09:09.320\n So just to linger on that moment further,\n\n09:09.320 --> 09:13.560\n do you think possible for them to achieve success\n\n09:13.560 --> 09:17.040\n with simply just a huge amount of this training\n\n09:17.040 --> 09:20.400\n on edge cases and difficult cases in urban environments,\n\n09:20.400 --> 09:21.760\n not just highway and so on?\n\n09:22.760 --> 09:24.520\n I think it would be very hard.\n\n09:24.520 --> 09:27.040\n One could characterize Tesla's approach\n\n09:27.040 --> 09:29.840\n as kind of a Chinese strength approach, right?\n\n09:29.840 --> 09:31.560\n Gather all the data you can\n\n09:31.560 --> 09:34.000\n and hope that will overcome the problems.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.080\n But in autonomous driving,\n\n09:36.080 --> 09:40.400\n clearly a lot of the decisions aren't merely solved\n\n09:40.400 --> 09:43.480\n by aggregating data and having feedback loop.\n\n09:43.480 --> 09:48.000\n There are things that are more akin to human thinking.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:51.640\n And how would those be integrated and built?\n\n09:51.640 --> 09:53.960\n There has not yet been a lot of success\n\n09:53.960 --> 09:56.400\n integrating human intelligence\n\n09:56.400 --> 09:58.760\n or call it expert systems if you will,\n\n09:58.760 --> 10:02.920\n even though that's a taboo word with the machine learning.\n\n10:02.920 --> 10:05.560\n And the integration of the two types of thinking\n\n10:05.560 --> 10:07.800\n hasn't yet been demonstrated.\n\n10:07.800 --> 10:09.920\n And the question is how much can you push\n\n10:09.920 --> 10:12.360\n a purely machine learning approach?\n\n10:12.360 --> 10:15.480\n And of course, Tesla also has an additional constraint\n\n10:15.480 --> 10:18.480\n that they don't have all the sensors.\n\n10:18.480 --> 10:21.120\n I know that they think it's foolish to use LIDARs,\n\n10:21.120 --> 10:25.080\n but that's clearly a one less very valuable\n\n10:25.080 --> 10:28.880\n and reliable source of input that they're foregoing,\n\n10:28.880 --> 10:31.120\n which may also have consequences.\n\n10:32.400 --> 10:34.960\n I think the advantage of course is capturing data\n\n10:34.960 --> 10:37.080\n that no one has ever seen before.\n\n10:37.080 --> 10:40.680\n And in some cases such as computer vision\n\n10:40.680 --> 10:42.240\n and speech recognition,\n\n10:42.240 --> 10:44.880\n I have seen Chinese companies accumulate data\n\n10:44.880 --> 10:47.360\n that's not seen anywhere in the Western world\n\n10:47.360 --> 10:50.280\n and they have delivered superior results.\n\n10:50.280 --> 10:53.760\n But then speech recognition and object recognition\n\n10:53.760 --> 10:57.120\n are relatively suitable problems for deep learning\n\n10:57.120 --> 11:00.800\n and don't have the potentially need\n\n11:00.800 --> 11:04.480\n for the human intelligence analytical planning elements.\n\n11:04.480 --> 11:06.440\n And the same on the speech recognition side,\n\n11:06.440 --> 11:08.960\n your intuition that speech recognition\n\n11:08.960 --> 11:11.480\n and the machine learning approaches to speech recognition\n\n11:11.480 --> 11:14.520\n won't take us to a conversational system\n\n11:14.520 --> 11:15.960\n that can pass the Turing test,\n\n11:15.960 --> 11:20.080\n which is sort of maybe akin to what driving is.\n\n11:20.080 --> 11:22.760\n So it needs to have something more than just simply\n\n11:24.480 --> 11:27.520\n simple language understanding, simple language generation.\n\n11:27.520 --> 11:28.720\n Roughly right.\n\n11:28.720 --> 11:33.120\n I would say that based on purely machine learning approaches,\n\n11:33.120 --> 11:35.960\n it's hard to imagine it could lead\n\n11:35.960 --> 11:40.520\n to a full conversational experience\n\n11:40.520 --> 11:44.600\n across arbitrary domains, which is akin to L5.\n\n11:44.600 --> 11:46.920\n I'm a little hesitant to use the word Turing test\n\n11:46.920 --> 11:50.280\n because the original definition was probably too easy.\n\n11:50.280 --> 11:52.320\n We probably do that, yeah.\n\n11:52.320 --> 11:54.400\n The spirit of the Turing test\n\n11:54.400 --> 11:56.520\n is what I was referring to. Of course.\n\n11:56.520 --> 11:59.440\n So you've had major leadership research positions\n\n11:59.440 --> 12:01.640\n at Apple, Microsoft, Google.\n\n12:01.640 --> 12:05.120\n So continuing on the discussion of America, Russia,\n\n12:05.120 --> 12:07.640\n Chinese, Seoul and culture and so on.\n\n12:09.200 --> 12:11.360\n What is the culture of Silicon Valley\n\n12:12.440 --> 12:16.320\n in contrast to China and maybe US broadly?\n\n12:16.320 --> 12:18.760\n And what is the unique culture\n\n12:18.760 --> 12:22.080\n of each of these three major companies in your view?\n\n12:22.080 --> 12:25.120\n I think in aggregate, Silicon Valley companies,\n\n12:25.120 --> 12:27.200\n and we could probably include Microsoft in that,\n\n12:27.200 --> 12:29.120\n even though they're not in the Valley,\n\n12:29.120 --> 12:33.960\n is really dream big and have visionary goals\n\n12:33.960 --> 12:37.960\n and believe that technology will conquer all.\n\n12:37.960 --> 12:42.280\n And also the self confidence and the self entitlement\n\n12:42.280 --> 12:43.560\n that whatever they produce,\n\n12:43.560 --> 12:47.240\n the whole world should use and must use.\n\n12:47.240 --> 12:52.240\n And those are historically important, I think.\n\n12:54.080 --> 12:59.080\n Steve Jobs famous quote that he doesn't do focus groups,\n\n12:59.080 --> 13:02.360\n he looks in the mirror and asks the person in the mirror,\n\n13:02.360 --> 13:03.520\n what do you want?\n\n13:03.520 --> 13:07.880\n And that really is an inspirational comment that says,\n\n13:07.880 --> 13:11.240\n the great company shouldn't just ask users what they want,\n\n13:11.240 --> 13:15.160\n but develop something that users will know they want\n\n13:15.160 --> 13:16.200\n when they see it,\n\n13:16.200 --> 13:18.920\n but they could never come up with themselves.\n\n13:18.920 --> 13:23.840\n I think that is probably the most exhilarating description\n\n13:23.840 --> 13:26.520\n of what the essence of Silicon Valley is,\n\n13:26.520 --> 13:31.520\n that this brilliant idea could cause you to build something\n\n13:31.800 --> 13:35.480\n that couldn't come out of the focus groups or AB tests.\n\n13:35.480 --> 13:38.000\n And iPhone would be an example of that.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.520\n No one in the age of Blackberry would write down\n\n13:40.520 --> 13:42.760\n they want an iPhone or multi touch.\n\n13:42.760 --> 13:44.760\n A browser might be another example.\n\n13:44.760 --> 13:47.480\n No one would say they want that in the days of FTP,\n\n13:47.480 --> 13:49.400\n but once they see it, they want it.\n\n13:49.400 --> 13:53.560\n So I think that is what Silicon Valley is best at.\n\n13:53.560 --> 13:58.560\n But it also comes with, it came with a lot of success.\n\n13:58.920 --> 14:01.960\n These products became global platforms\n\n14:01.960 --> 14:05.120\n and there were basically no competitors anywhere.\n\n14:05.120 --> 14:08.440\n And that has also led to a belief\n\n14:08.440 --> 14:13.240\n that these are the only things that one should do,\n\n14:13.240 --> 14:17.960\n that companies should not tread on other companies territory\n\n14:17.960 --> 14:22.960\n so that a Groupon and a Yelp and then OpenTable\n\n14:24.080 --> 14:26.280\n and the Grubhub would each feel,\n\n14:26.280 --> 14:28.560\n okay, I'm not gonna do the other company's business\n\n14:28.560 --> 14:32.360\n because that would not be the pride of innovating\n\n14:33.280 --> 14:35.880\n what each of these four companies have innovated.\n\n14:36.920 --> 14:40.320\n But I think the Chinese approach\n\n14:40.320 --> 14:42.720\n is do whatever it takes to win.\n\n14:42.720 --> 14:45.000\n And it's a winner take all market.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.200\n And in fact, in the internet space,\n\n14:47.200 --> 14:50.880\n the market leader will get predominantly all the value\n\n14:50.880 --> 14:53.320\n extracted out of the system.\n\n14:53.320 --> 14:57.840\n So, and the system isn't just defined\n\n14:57.840 --> 15:01.360\n as one narrow category, but gets broader and broader.\n\n15:01.360 --> 15:06.360\n So it's amazing ambition for success and domination\n\n15:07.960 --> 15:11.760\n of increasingly larger product categories\n\n15:11.760 --> 15:15.080\n leading to clear market winner status\n\n15:15.080 --> 15:19.080\n and the opportunity to extract tremendous value.\n\n15:19.080 --> 15:24.080\n And that develops a practical, result oriented,\n\n15:25.840 --> 15:30.840\n ultra ambitious winner take all gladiatorial mentality.\n\n15:31.480 --> 15:36.480\n And if what it takes is to build what the competitors built,\n\n15:37.400 --> 15:40.000\n essentially a copycat that can be done\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:41.920\n without infringing laws.\n\n15:41.920 --> 15:46.280\n If what it takes is to satisfy a foreign country's need\n\n15:46.280 --> 15:48.480\n by forking the code base and building something\n\n15:48.480 --> 15:51.400\n that looks really ugly and different, they'll do it.\n\n15:51.400 --> 15:54.360\n So it's contrasted very sharply\n\n15:54.360 --> 15:56.240\n with the Silicon Valley approach.\n\n15:56.240 --> 16:00.040\n And I think the flexibility and the speed and execution\n\n16:00.040 --> 16:01.960\n has helped the Chinese approach.\n\n16:01.960 --> 16:04.080\n And I think the Silicon Valley approach\n\n16:05.040 --> 16:10.040\n is potentially challenged if every Chinese entrepreneur\n\n16:10.040 --> 16:13.240\n is learning from the whole world, US and China,\n\n16:13.240 --> 16:16.320\n and the American entrepreneurs only look internally\n\n16:16.320 --> 16:19.640\n and write off China as a copycat.\n\n16:19.640 --> 16:21.360\n And the second part of your question\n\n16:21.360 --> 16:23.560\n about the three companies.\n\n16:23.560 --> 16:26.080\n The unique elements of the three companies perhaps.\n\n16:26.080 --> 16:30.440\n Yeah, I think Apple represents\n\n16:30.440 --> 16:33.160\n while the user please the user\n\n16:33.160 --> 16:38.160\n and the essence of design and brand\n\n16:38.160 --> 16:43.160\n and it's the one company and perhaps the only tech company\n\n16:43.640 --> 16:48.640\n that draws people with a strong, serious desire\n\n16:49.440 --> 16:53.080\n for the product and the willingness to pay a premium\n\n16:53.080 --> 16:56.440\n because of the halo effect of the brand\n\n16:56.440 --> 16:59.640\n which came from the attention to detail\n\n16:59.640 --> 17:01.760\n and great respect for user needs.\n\n17:01.760 --> 17:06.760\n Microsoft represents a platform approach\n\n17:07.680 --> 17:12.680\n that builds giant products that become very strong modes\n\n17:12.760 --> 17:17.280\n that others can't do because it's well architected\n\n17:17.280 --> 17:22.280\n at the bottom level and the work is efficiently delegated\n\n17:23.640 --> 17:28.640\n to individuals and then the whole product is built\n\n17:28.640 --> 17:32.000\n by adding small parts that sum together.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:36.520\n So it's probably the most effective high tech assembly line\n\n17:36.520 --> 17:38.760\n that builds a very difficult product\n\n17:38.760 --> 17:43.040\n that and the whole process of doing that\n\n17:43.040 --> 17:48.040\n is kind of a differentiation and something competitors\n\n17:49.040 --> 17:50.800\n can't easily repeat.\n\n17:50.800 --> 17:53.080\n Are there elements of the Chinese approach\n\n17:53.080 --> 17:56.640\n in the way Microsoft went about assembling\n\n17:56.640 --> 17:59.000\n those little pieces and dominating,\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:02.320\n essentially dominating the market for a long time\n\n18:02.320 --> 18:04.040\n or do you see those as distinct?\n\n18:04.040 --> 18:06.680\n I think there are elements that are the same.\n\n18:06.680 --> 18:09.520\n I think the three American companies that had\n\n18:09.520 --> 18:12.960\n or have Chinese characteristics and obviously\n\n18:12.960 --> 18:16.280\n as well as American characteristics are Microsoft,\n\n18:16.280 --> 18:18.720\n Facebook and Amazon.\n\n18:18.720 --> 18:20.160\n Yes, that's right, Amazon.\n\n18:20.160 --> 18:23.920\n Because these are companies that will tenaciously\n\n18:23.920 --> 18:27.640\n go after adjacent markets,\n\n18:27.640 --> 18:32.640\n build up strong product offering and find ways\n\n18:34.360 --> 18:37.960\n to extract greater value from a sphere\n\n18:37.960 --> 18:41.480\n that's ever increasing and they understand\n\n18:41.480 --> 18:43.520\n the value of the platforms.\n\n18:43.520 --> 18:47.280\n So that's the similarity and then with Google,\n\n18:47.280 --> 18:52.280\n I think it's a genuinely value oriented company\n\n18:54.800 --> 18:57.000\n that does have a heart and soul\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.800\n and that wants to do great things for the world\n\n18:59.800 --> 19:01.920\n by connecting information\n\n19:01.920 --> 19:06.920\n and that has also very strong technology genes\n\n19:08.840 --> 19:13.280\n and wants to use technology\n\n19:13.280 --> 19:18.280\n and has found out of the box ways to use technology\n\n19:19.120 --> 19:23.720\n to deliver incredible value to the end user.\n\n19:23.720 --> 19:25.240\n If you can look at Google, for example,\n\n19:25.240 --> 19:26.760\n you mentioned heart and soul.\n\n19:28.040 --> 19:31.840\n There seems to be an element where Google\n\n19:31.840 --> 19:34.840\n is after making the world better.\n\n19:34.840 --> 19:36.920\n There's a more positive view.\n\n19:36.920 --> 19:39.280\n They used to have the slogan, don't be evil.\n\n19:39.280 --> 19:43.120\n And Facebook a little bit more has a negative tend to it.\n\n19:43.120 --> 19:45.760\n At least in the perception of privacy and so on.\n\n19:45.760 --> 19:50.760\n Do you have a sense of how these different companies\n\n19:51.080 --> 19:53.040\n can achieve, because you've talked about\n\n19:53.040 --> 19:54.520\n how much we can make the world better\n\n19:54.520 --> 19:56.760\n in all these kinds of ways with AI.\n\n19:56.760 --> 19:59.360\n What is it about a company that can make,\n\n19:59.360 --> 20:03.200\n give it a heart and soul, gain the trust of the public\n\n20:03.200 --> 20:06.120\n and just actually just not be evil\n\n20:06.120 --> 20:08.000\n and do good for the world?\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.240\n It's really hard and I think Google\n\n20:10.240 --> 20:13.120\n has struggled with that.\n\n20:13.120 --> 20:16.720\n First, the don't do evil mantra is very dangerous\n\n20:16.720 --> 20:20.800\n because every employee's definition of evil is different.\n\n20:20.800 --> 20:22.600\n And that has led to some difficult\n\n20:22.600 --> 20:25.120\n employee situations for them.\n\n20:25.120 --> 20:29.560\n So I don't necessarily think that's a good value statement,\n\n20:29.560 --> 20:32.320\n but just watching the kinds of things Google\n\n20:32.320 --> 20:35.320\n or its parent company Alphabet does\n\n20:35.320 --> 20:40.320\n in new areas like healthcare, like eradicating mosquitoes,\n\n20:40.480 --> 20:42.360\n things that are really not in the business\n\n20:42.360 --> 20:44.520\n of a internet tech company.\n\n20:44.520 --> 20:47.200\n I think that shows that there's a heart and soul\n\n20:47.200 --> 20:50.360\n and desire to do good and willingness\n\n20:50.360 --> 20:54.800\n to put in the resources to do something\n\n20:54.800 --> 20:57.240\n when they see it's good, they will pursue it.\n\n20:58.280 --> 21:00.160\n That doesn't necessarily mean\n\n21:00.160 --> 21:02.480\n it has all the trust of the users.\n\n21:02.480 --> 21:06.360\n I realize while most people would view Facebook\n\n21:06.360 --> 21:09.760\n as the primary target of their recent unhappiness\n\n21:09.760 --> 21:11.560\n about Silicon Valley companies,\n\n21:11.560 --> 21:14.040\n many would put Google in that category.\n\n21:14.040 --> 21:16.760\n And some have named Google's business practices\n\n21:16.760 --> 21:19.720\n as predatory also.\n\n21:19.720 --> 21:24.240\n So it's kind of difficult to have the two parts of a body.\n\n21:24.240 --> 21:27.440\n The brain wants to do what it's supposed to do\n\n21:27.440 --> 21:29.280\n for a shareholder, maximize profit.\n\n21:29.280 --> 21:32.000\n And then the heart and soul wants to do good things\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:36.120\n that may run against what the brain wants to do.\n\n21:36.120 --> 21:39.000\n So in this complex balancing\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.320\n that these companies have to do,\n\n21:40.320 --> 21:42.480\n you've mentioned that you're concerned\n\n21:42.480 --> 21:45.480\n about a future where too few companies\n\n21:45.480 --> 21:49.640\n like Google, Facebook, Amazon are controlling our data\n\n21:49.640 --> 21:53.360\n or controlling too much of our digital lives.\n\n21:53.360 --> 21:54.840\n Can you elaborate on this concern\n\n21:54.840 --> 21:57.560\n and perhaps do you have a better way forward?\n\n21:57.560 --> 22:02.560\n I think I'm hardly the most vocal complainer of this.\n\n22:02.760 --> 22:03.760\n Sure, of course.\n\n22:03.760 --> 22:06.240\n There are a lot louder complainers out there.\n\n22:06.240 --> 22:10.760\n I do observe that having a lot of data\n\n22:10.760 --> 22:13.600\n does perpetuate their strength\n\n22:13.600 --> 22:18.600\n and limits competition in many spaces.\n\n22:18.600 --> 22:21.560\n But I also believe AI is much broader\n\n22:21.560 --> 22:23.160\n than the internet space.\n\n22:23.160 --> 22:26.520\n So the entrepreneurial opportunities still exists\n\n22:26.520 --> 22:30.600\n in using AI to empower financial,\n\n22:30.600 --> 22:34.600\n retail, manufacturing, education applications.\n\n22:34.600 --> 22:36.440\n So I don't think it's quite a case\n\n22:36.440 --> 22:38.920\n of full monopolistic dominance\n\n22:38.920 --> 22:43.160\n that totally stifles innovation.\n\n22:43.160 --> 22:45.600\n But I do believe in their areas of strength\n\n22:45.600 --> 22:47.960\n it's hard to dislodge them.\n\n22:48.960 --> 22:52.480\n I don't know if I have a good solution.\n\n22:52.480 --> 22:54.960\n Probably the best solution is let\n\n22:54.960 --> 22:58.320\n the entrepreneurial VC ecosystem work well\n\n22:58.320 --> 23:02.160\n and find all the places that can create the next Google,\n\n23:02.160 --> 23:03.520\n the next Facebook.\n\n23:03.520 --> 23:07.880\n So there will always be increasing number of challengers.\n\n23:07.880 --> 23:10.680\n In some sense that has happened a little bit.\n\n23:10.680 --> 23:14.000\n You see Uber, Airbnb having emerged\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.960\n despite the strength of the big three.\n\n23:19.440 --> 23:21.760\n And I think China as an environment\n\n23:21.760 --> 23:24.520\n may be more interesting for the emergence\n\n23:24.520 --> 23:26.120\n because if you look at companies\n\n23:26.120 --> 23:31.120\n between let's say 50 to $300 billion,\n\n23:32.920 --> 23:35.720\n China has emerged more of such companies\n\n23:35.720 --> 23:39.320\n than the US in the last three to four years\n\n23:39.320 --> 23:41.560\n because of the larger marketplace,\n\n23:41.560 --> 23:45.160\n because of the more fearless nature of the entrepreneurs.\n\n23:46.440 --> 23:48.960\n And the Chinese giants are just as powerful\n\n23:48.960 --> 23:50.240\n as American ones.\n\n23:50.240 --> 23:52.360\n Tencent, Alibaba are very strong,\n\n23:52.360 --> 23:56.480\n but ByteDance has emerged worth 75 billion\n\n23:56.480 --> 23:59.600\n and financial while it's Alibaba affiliated,\n\n23:59.600 --> 24:03.400\n it's nevertheless independent and worth 150 billion.\n\n24:03.400 --> 24:07.800\n And so I do think if we start to extend\n\n24:07.800 --> 24:09.440\n to traditional businesses,\n\n24:09.440 --> 24:12.160\n we will see very valuable companies.\n\n24:12.160 --> 24:17.160\n So it's probably not the case that in five or 10 years\n\n24:17.600 --> 24:19.160\n we'll still see the whole world\n\n24:19.160 --> 24:22.720\n with these five companies having such dominance.\n\n24:22.720 --> 24:24.760\n So you've mentioned a couple of times\n\n24:26.080 --> 24:29.240\n this fascinating world of entrepreneurship in China\n\n24:29.240 --> 24:31.080\n of the fearless nature of the entrepreneur.\n\n24:31.080 --> 24:33.240\n So can you maybe talk a little bit about\n\n24:33.240 --> 24:35.520\n what it takes to be an entrepreneur in China?\n\n24:35.520 --> 24:38.240\n What are the strategies that are undertaken?\n\n24:38.240 --> 24:41.120\n What are the ways to achieve success?\n\n24:41.120 --> 24:43.920\n What is the dynamic of VCF funding\n\n24:43.920 --> 24:46.480\n of the way the government helps companies and so on?\n\n24:46.480 --> 24:47.880\n What are the interesting aspects here\n\n24:47.880 --> 24:50.200\n that are distinct from, that are different\n\n24:50.200 --> 24:54.200\n from the Silicon Valley world of entrepreneurship?\n\n24:55.240 --> 24:59.400\n Well, many of the listeners probably still\n\n24:59.400 --> 25:03.000\n would brand Chinese entrepreneur as copycats.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.360\n And no doubt 10 years ago,\n\n25:05.360 --> 25:09.080\n that would not be an inaccurate description.\n\n25:09.080 --> 25:10.760\n Back 10 years ago,\n\n25:10.760 --> 25:13.640\n an entrepreneur probably could not get funding\n\n25:13.640 --> 25:16.000\n if he or she could not describe\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:20.440\n what product he or she is copying from the US.\n\n25:20.440 --> 25:23.360\n The first question is who has proven this business model\n\n25:23.360 --> 25:27.200\n which is a nice way of asking who are you copying?\n\n25:27.200 --> 25:29.560\n And that reason is understandable\n\n25:29.560 --> 25:34.560\n because China had a much lower internet penetration\n\n25:34.880 --> 25:39.880\n and didn't have enough indigenous experience\n\n25:40.960 --> 25:43.240\n to build innovative products.\n\n25:43.240 --> 25:47.640\n And secondly, internet was emerging.\n\n25:47.640 --> 25:49.840\n Link startup was the way to do things,\n\n25:49.840 --> 25:52.960\n building a first minimally viable product\n\n25:52.960 --> 25:55.360\n and then expanding was the right way to go.\n\n25:55.360 --> 25:59.520\n And the American successes have given a shortcut\n\n25:59.520 --> 26:02.560\n that if you built your minimally viable product\n\n26:02.560 --> 26:04.240\n based on an American product,\n\n26:04.240 --> 26:06.720\n it's guaranteed to be a decent starting point.\n\n26:06.720 --> 26:08.400\n Then you tweak it afterwards.\n\n26:08.400 --> 26:11.280\n So as long as there are no IP infringement,\n\n26:11.280 --> 26:14.000\n which as far as I know there hasn't been in the mobile\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:19.000\n and AI spaces, that's a much better shortcut.\n\n26:19.360 --> 26:21.880\n And I think Silicon Valley would view that\n\n26:21.880 --> 26:25.120\n as still not very honorable\n\n26:25.120 --> 26:29.160\n because that's not your own idea to start with,\n\n26:29.160 --> 26:32.560\n but you can't really at the same time\n\n26:32.560 --> 26:35.120\n believe every idea must be your own\n\n26:35.120 --> 26:38.080\n and believe in the link startup methodology\n\n26:38.080 --> 26:41.840\n because link startup is intended to try many, many things\n\n26:41.840 --> 26:44.160\n and then converge when that works.\n\n26:44.160 --> 26:46.640\n And it's meant to be iterated and changed.\n\n26:46.640 --> 26:48.640\n So finding a decent starting point\n\n26:48.640 --> 26:51.160\n without legal violations,\n\n26:51.160 --> 26:55.240\n there should be nothing morally dishonorable about that.\n\n26:55.240 --> 26:56.920\n Yeah, so just a quick pause on that.\n\n26:56.920 --> 26:58.600\n It's fascinating that that's,\n\n26:59.760 --> 27:01.840\n why is that not honorable, right?\n\n27:01.840 --> 27:04.600\n It's exactly as you formulated.\n\n27:04.600 --> 27:07.600\n It seems like a perfect start for business.\n\n27:07.600 --> 27:12.080\n Is to take, look at Amazon and say,\n\n27:12.080 --> 27:14.480\n okay, we'll do exactly what Amazon is doing.\n\n27:14.480 --> 27:16.760\n Let's start there in this particular market\n\n27:16.760 --> 27:20.720\n and then let's out innovate them from that starting point.\n\n27:20.720 --> 27:22.200\n Come up with new ways.\n\n27:22.200 --> 27:23.760\n I mean, is it wrong to be,\n\n27:25.200 --> 27:27.080\n except the word copycat just sounds bad,\n\n27:27.080 --> 27:28.760\n but is it wrong to be a copycat?\n\n27:28.760 --> 27:31.600\n It just seems like a smart strategy,\n\n27:31.600 --> 27:35.760\n but yes, it doesn't have a heroic nature to it\n\n27:35.760 --> 27:40.720\n that like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk,\n\n27:40.720 --> 27:42.200\n sort of in something completely,\n\n27:42.200 --> 27:43.880\n coming up with something completely new.\n\n27:43.880 --> 27:45.280\n Yeah, I like the way you describe it.\n\n27:45.280 --> 27:50.440\n It's a nonheroic, acceptable way to start the company\n\n27:50.440 --> 27:52.800\n and maybe more expedient.\n\n27:52.800 --> 27:57.800\n So that's, I think, a baggage for Silicon Valley\n\n27:58.920 --> 28:00.760\n that if it doesn't let go,\n\n28:00.760 --> 28:05.120\n then it may limit the ultimate ceiling of the company.\n\n28:05.120 --> 28:07.200\n Take Snapchat as an example.\n\n28:07.200 --> 28:09.840\n I think, you know, Evan's brilliant.\n\n28:09.840 --> 28:11.520\n He built a great product,\n\n28:11.520 --> 28:15.440\n but he's very proud that he wants to build his own features,\n\n28:15.440 --> 28:16.800\n not copy others.\n\n28:16.800 --> 28:20.960\n While Facebook was more willing to copy his features\n\n28:20.960 --> 28:23.440\n and you see what happens in the competition.\n\n28:23.440 --> 28:27.440\n So I think putting that handcuff on the company\n\n28:27.440 --> 28:31.560\n would limit its ability to reach the maximum potential.\n\n28:31.560 --> 28:33.840\n So back to the Chinese environment,\n\n28:33.840 --> 28:38.400\n copying was merely a way to learn from the American masters.\n\n28:38.400 --> 28:43.400\n Just like we, if we learned to play piano or painting,\n\n28:43.440 --> 28:44.520\n you start by copying.\n\n28:44.520 --> 28:45.960\n You don't start by innovating\n\n28:45.960 --> 28:48.160\n when you don't have the basic skill sets.\n\n28:48.160 --> 28:51.000\n So very amazingly, the Chinese entrepreneurs\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:56.000\n about six years ago started to branch off\n\n28:56.120 --> 28:59.480\n with these lean startups built on American ideas\n\n28:59.480 --> 29:02.120\n to build better products than American products.\n\n29:02.120 --> 29:04.960\n But they did start from the American idea.\n\n29:04.960 --> 29:08.560\n And today WeChat is better than WhatsApp,\n\n29:08.560 --> 29:10.520\n Weibo is better than Twitter,\n\n29:10.520 --> 29:12.920\n Zhihu is better than Quora and so on.\n\n29:12.920 --> 29:17.920\n So that I think is Chinese entrepreneurs going to step two.\n\n29:18.520 --> 29:21.560\n And then step three is once these entrepreneurs\n\n29:21.560 --> 29:23.720\n have done one or two of these companies,\n\n29:23.720 --> 29:27.400\n they now look at the Chinese market and the opportunities\n\n29:27.400 --> 29:30.600\n and come up with ideas that didn't exist elsewhere.\n\n29:30.600 --> 29:34.200\n So products like Ant Financial,\n\n29:34.200 --> 29:38.280\n under which includes Alipay, which is mobile payments,\n\n29:38.280 --> 29:43.280\n and also the financial products for loans built on that.\n\n29:44.320 --> 29:47.560\n And also in education, VIPKID,\n\n29:48.560 --> 29:53.560\n and in social video, social network, TikTok,\n\n29:54.880 --> 29:58.640\n and in social eCommerce, Pinduoduo,\n\n29:58.640 --> 30:01.680\n and then in ride sharing, Mobike,\n\n30:01.680 --> 30:05.600\n these are all Chinese innovated products\n\n30:05.600 --> 30:08.680\n that now are being copied elsewhere.\n\n30:08.680 --> 30:13.000\n So an additional interesting observation\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:14.240\n is some of these products\n\n30:14.240 --> 30:17.240\n are built on unique Chinese demographics,\n\n30:17.240 --> 30:19.360\n which may not work in the US,\n\n30:19.360 --> 30:23.120\n but may work very well in Southeast Asia, Africa,\n\n30:23.120 --> 30:25.160\n and other developing worlds\n\n30:25.160 --> 30:27.800\n that are a few years behind China.\n\n30:27.800 --> 30:31.000\n And a few of these products maybe are universal\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.720\n and are getting traction even in the United States,\n\n30:33.720 --> 30:35.320\n such as TikTok.\n\n30:35.320 --> 30:40.320\n So this whole ecosystem is supported by VCs\n\n30:42.040 --> 30:43.480\n as a virtuous cycle,\n\n30:43.480 --> 30:47.640\n because a large market with innovative entrepreneurs\n\n30:47.640 --> 30:49.360\n will draw a lot of money\n\n30:49.360 --> 30:51.520\n and then invest in these companies.\n\n30:51.520 --> 30:54.480\n As the market gets larger and larger,\n\n30:54.480 --> 30:58.440\n the China market is easily three, four times larger than the US,\n\n30:58.440 --> 31:01.120\n they will create greater value and greater returns\n\n31:01.120 --> 31:05.400\n for the VCs, thereby raising even more money.\n\n31:05.400 --> 31:09.960\n So at Sinovation Ventures, our first fund was 15 million,\n\n31:09.960 --> 31:12.000\n our last fund was 500 million.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:16.520\n So it reflects the valuation of the companies\n\n31:16.520 --> 31:19.840\n and our us going multi stage and things like that.\n\n31:19.840 --> 31:22.000\n It also has government support,\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:25.360\n but not in the way most Americans would think of it.\n\n31:25.360 --> 31:28.720\n The government actually leaves the entrepreneurial space\n\n31:28.720 --> 31:32.400\n as a private enterprise, sort of self regulating,\n\n31:32.400 --> 31:35.400\n and the government would build infrastructures\n\n31:35.400 --> 31:38.520\n that would around it to make it work better.\n\n31:38.520 --> 31:42.160\n For example, the Mass Entrepreneur Mass Innovation Plan\n\n31:42.160 --> 31:44.120\n builds 8,000 incubators,\n\n31:44.120 --> 31:47.560\n so the pipeline is very strong to the VCs.\n\n31:47.560 --> 31:48.920\n For autonomous vehicles,\n\n31:48.920 --> 31:52.600\n the Chinese government is building smart highways\n\n31:52.600 --> 31:54.640\n with sensors, smart cities\n\n31:54.640 --> 31:57.240\n that separate pedestrians from cars\n\n31:57.240 --> 32:00.440\n that may allow initially an inferior\n\n32:00.440 --> 32:03.640\n autonomous vehicle company to launch a car\n\n32:03.640 --> 32:07.000\n without increasing with lower casualty\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:10.880\n because the roads or the city is smart.\n\n32:10.880 --> 32:13.160\n And the Chinese government at local levels\n\n32:13.160 --> 32:16.720\n would have these guiding funds acting as LPs,\n\n32:16.720 --> 32:18.800\n passive LPs to funds.\n\n32:18.800 --> 32:21.400\n And when the fund makes money,\n\n32:21.400 --> 32:23.880\n part of the money made is given back\n\n32:23.880 --> 32:26.720\n to the GPs and potentially other LPs\n\n32:26.720 --> 32:30.480\n to increase everybody's return\n\n32:30.480 --> 32:33.080\n at the expense of the government's return.\n\n32:33.080 --> 32:35.800\n So that's an interesting incentive\n\n32:35.800 --> 32:40.800\n that entrusts the task of choosing entrepreneurs to VCs\n\n32:41.080 --> 32:43.240\n who are better at it than the government\n\n32:43.240 --> 32:46.080\n by letting some of the profits move that way.\n\n32:46.080 --> 32:48.720\n So this is really fascinating, right?\n\n32:48.720 --> 32:51.800\n So I look at the Russian government as a case study\n\n32:51.800 --> 32:54.240\n where, let me put it this way,\n\n32:54.240 --> 32:57.840\n there's no such government driven\n\n32:57.840 --> 33:00.840\n large scale support of entrepreneurship.\n\n33:00.840 --> 33:04.000\n And probably the same is true in the United States,\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:07.640\n but the entrepreneurs themselves kind of find a way.\n\n33:07.640 --> 33:11.640\n So maybe in a form of advice or explanation,\n\n33:11.640 --> 33:15.560\n how did the Chinese government arrive to be this way\n\n33:15.560 --> 33:17.720\n so supportive on entrepreneurship\n\n33:17.720 --> 33:21.520\n to be in this particular way so forward thinking\n\n33:21.520 --> 33:23.120\n at such a large scale?\n\n33:23.120 --> 33:27.080\n And also perhaps, how can we copy it in other countries?\n\n33:28.280 --> 33:29.800\n How can we encourage other governments,\n\n33:29.800 --> 33:31.600\n like even the United States government,\n\n33:31.600 --> 33:33.800\n to support infrastructure for autonomous vehicles\n\n33:33.800 --> 33:36.040\n in that same kind of way, perhaps?\n\n33:36.040 --> 33:41.040\n Yes, so these techniques are\n\n33:41.040 --> 33:44.440\n the result of several key things,\n\n33:44.440 --> 33:46.040\n some of which may be learnable,\n\n33:46.040 --> 33:48.040\n some of which may be very hard.\n\n33:48.040 --> 33:50.520\n One is just trial and error\n\n33:50.520 --> 33:52.920\n and watching what everyone else is doing.\n\n33:52.920 --> 33:54.680\n I think it's important to be humble\n\n33:54.680 --> 33:56.920\n and not feel like you know all the answers.\n\n33:56.920 --> 33:59.480\n The guiding funds idea came from Singapore,\n\n33:59.480 --> 34:01.440\n which came from Israel.\n\n34:01.440 --> 34:06.120\n And China made a few tweaks and turned it into a,\n\n34:06.120 --> 34:09.320\n because the Chinese cities and government officials\n\n34:09.320 --> 34:11.360\n kind of compete with each other\n\n34:11.360 --> 34:14.680\n because they all want to make their city more successful\n\n34:14.680 --> 34:19.680\n so they can get the next level in their political career.\n\n34:20.280 --> 34:22.280\n And it's somewhat competitive.\n\n34:22.280 --> 34:25.160\n So the central government made it a bit of a competition.\n\n34:25.160 --> 34:26.800\n Everybody has a budget.\n\n34:26.800 --> 34:29.840\n They can put it on AI or they can put it on bio\n\n34:29.840 --> 34:32.160\n or they can put it on energy.\n\n34:32.160 --> 34:34.120\n And then whoever gets the results,\n\n34:34.120 --> 34:36.160\n the city shines, the people are better off,\n\n34:36.160 --> 34:37.960\n the mayor gets a promotion.\n\n34:37.960 --> 34:41.680\n So the tools is kind of almost like an entrepreneurial\n\n34:41.680 --> 34:44.840\n environment for local governments\n\n34:44.840 --> 34:47.480\n to see who can do a better job.\n\n34:47.480 --> 34:52.480\n And also many of them try different experiments.\n\n34:52.480 --> 34:57.480\n Some have given award to very smart researchers.\n\n34:58.480 --> 35:00.840\n Just give them money and hope they'll start a company.\n\n35:00.840 --> 35:05.840\n Some have given money to academic research labs,\n\n35:05.840 --> 35:08.080\n maybe government research labs\n\n35:08.080 --> 35:10.760\n to see if they can spin off some companies\n\n35:10.760 --> 35:14.080\n from the science lab or something like that.\n\n35:14.080 --> 35:17.120\n Some have tried to recruit overseas Chinese\n\n35:17.120 --> 35:19.000\n to come back and start companies.\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\n And they've had mixed results.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.400\n The one that worked the best was the guiding funds.\n\n35:23.400 --> 35:25.880\n So it's almost like a lean startup idea\n\n35:25.880 --> 35:27.560\n where people try different things\n\n35:27.560 --> 35:30.600\n and what works sticks and everybody copies.\n\n35:30.600 --> 35:32.880\n So now every city has a guiding fund.\n\n35:32.880 --> 35:34.600\n So that's how that came about.\n\n35:34.600 --> 35:39.600\n The autonomous vehicle and the massive spending\n\n35:40.400 --> 35:45.400\n in highways and smart cities, that's a Chinese way.\n\n35:46.080 --> 35:49.520\n It's about building infrastructure to facilitate.\n\n35:49.520 --> 35:52.880\n It's a clear division of the government's responsibility\n\n35:52.880 --> 35:55.400\n from the market.\n\n35:55.400 --> 36:00.400\n The market should do everything in a private freeway,\n\n36:00.560 --> 36:02.920\n but there are things the market can't afford to do\n\n36:02.920 --> 36:04.480\n like infrastructure.\n\n36:04.480 --> 36:08.680\n So the government always appropriates large amounts\n\n36:08.680 --> 36:11.960\n of money for infrastructure building.\n\n36:11.960 --> 36:16.840\n This happens with not only autonomous vehicle and AI,\n\n36:16.840 --> 36:20.800\n but happened with the 3G and 4G.\n\n36:20.800 --> 36:25.320\n You'll find that the Chinese wireless reception\n\n36:25.320 --> 36:28.560\n is better than the US because massive spending\n\n36:28.560 --> 36:30.600\n that tries to cover the whole country,\n\n36:30.600 --> 36:33.040\n whereas in the US it may be a little spotty.\n\n36:33.040 --> 36:36.880\n It's a government driven because I think they view\n\n36:36.880 --> 36:41.880\n the coverage of cell access and 3G, 4G access\n\n36:44.120 --> 36:47.080\n to be a governmental infrastructure spending\n\n36:47.080 --> 36:49.880\n as opposed to capitalistic.\n\n36:49.880 --> 36:52.240\n So that's, of course, the state owned enterprises\n\n36:52.240 --> 36:54.280\n are also publicly traded,\n\n36:54.280 --> 36:57.760\n but they also carry a government responsibility\n\n36:57.760 --> 37:00.240\n to deliver infrastructure to all.\n\n37:00.240 --> 37:01.920\n So it's a different way of thinking\n\n37:01.920 --> 37:05.440\n that may be very hard to inject into Western countries\n\n37:05.440 --> 37:09.320\n to say starting tomorrow, bandwidth infrastructure\n\n37:09.320 --> 37:13.880\n and highways are gonna be governmental spending\n\n37:13.880 --> 37:16.120\n with some characteristics.\n\n37:16.120 --> 37:18.280\n What's your sense, and sorry to interrupt,\n\n37:18.280 --> 37:20.480\n but because it's such a fascinating point,\n\n37:21.680 --> 37:24.120\n do you think on the autonomous vehicle space\n\n37:25.600 --> 37:30.160\n it's possible to solve the problem of full autonomy\n\n37:30.160 --> 37:33.080\n without significant investment in infrastructure?\n\n37:34.120 --> 37:36.440\n Well, that's really hard to speculate.\n\n37:36.440 --> 37:39.000\n I think it's not a yes, no question,\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:40.680\n but how long does it take question?\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:45.200\n 15 years, 30 years, 45 years.\n\n37:45.200 --> 37:49.040\n Clearly with infrastructure augmentation,\n\n37:49.040 --> 37:52.360\n whether it's road, the city or whole city planning,\n\n37:52.360 --> 37:56.480\n building a new city, I'm sure that will accelerate\n\n37:56.480 --> 37:58.320\n the day of the L5.\n\n37:58.320 --> 38:01.280\n I'm not knowledgeable enough,\n\n38:01.280 --> 38:03.920\n and it's hard to predict even when we're knowledgeable\n\n38:03.920 --> 38:06.080\n because a lot of it is speculative.\n\n38:07.160 --> 38:10.440\n But in the US, I don't think people would consider\n\n38:10.440 --> 38:13.280\n building a new city the size of Chicago\n\n38:13.280 --> 38:15.960\n to make it the AI slash autonomous city.\n\n38:15.960 --> 38:18.880\n There are smaller ones being built, I'm aware of that.\n\n38:18.880 --> 38:22.040\n But is infrastructure spend really impossible\n\n38:22.040 --> 38:23.720\n for US or Western countries?\n\n38:23.720 --> 38:25.760\n I don't think so.\n\n38:25.760 --> 38:28.920\n The US highway system was built,\n\n38:28.920 --> 38:31.960\n was that during President Eisenhower or Kennedy?\n\n38:31.960 --> 38:33.160\n Eisenhower, yeah.\n\n38:33.160 --> 38:37.240\n So maybe historians can study\n\n38:37.240 --> 38:40.280\n how the President Eisenhower get the resources\n\n38:40.280 --> 38:42.800\n to build this massive infrastructure\n\n38:42.800 --> 38:47.560\n that surely gave US a tremendous amount of prosperity\n\n38:47.560 --> 38:50.800\n over the next decade, if not century.\n\n38:50.800 --> 38:53.080\n If I may comment on that then,\n\n38:53.080 --> 38:55.440\n it takes us to artificial intelligence a little bit\n\n38:55.440 --> 38:58.080\n because in order to build infrastructure,\n\n38:58.080 --> 39:00.520\n it creates a lot of jobs.\n\n39:00.520 --> 39:03.400\n So I'll be actually interested if you would say\n\n39:03.400 --> 39:06.560\n that you talk in your book about all kinds of jobs\n\n39:06.560 --> 39:08.920\n that could and could not be automated.\n\n39:08.920 --> 39:13.080\n I wonder if building infrastructure is one of the jobs\n\n39:13.080 --> 39:15.760\n that would not be easily automated.\n\n39:15.760 --> 39:17.040\n Something you could think about\n\n39:17.040 --> 39:19.920\n because I think you've mentioned somewhere in the talk\n\n39:19.920 --> 39:24.280\n or that there might be, as jobs are being automated,\n\n39:24.280 --> 39:26.200\n a role for government to create jobs\n\n39:26.200 --> 39:28.160\n that can't be automated.\n\n39:28.160 --> 39:31.040\n Yes, I think that's a possibility.\n\n39:31.040 --> 39:34.280\n Back in the last financial crisis,\n\n39:34.280 --> 39:37.840\n China put a lot of money\n\n39:37.840 --> 39:41.200\n to basically give this economy a boost\n\n39:41.200 --> 39:44.600\n and a lot of it went into infrastructure building.\n\n39:45.480 --> 39:49.920\n And I think that's a legitimate way at the government level\n\n39:49.920 --> 39:54.360\n to deal with the employment issues\n\n39:54.360 --> 39:57.040\n as well as build out the infrastructure\n\n39:57.040 --> 39:59.840\n as long as the infrastructures are truly needed\n\n39:59.840 --> 40:02.160\n and as long as there is an employment problem,\n\n40:02.160 --> 40:04.000\n which no, we don't know.\n\n40:04.920 --> 40:07.840\n So maybe taking a little step back,\n\n40:07.840 --> 40:12.840\n if you've been a leader and a researcher in AI\n\n40:12.840 --> 40:16.200\n for several decades, at least 30 years,\n\n40:16.200 --> 40:21.000\n so how has AI changed in the West and the East\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:23.080\n as you've observed, as you've been deep in it\n\n40:23.080 --> 40:25.080\n over the past 30 years?\n\n40:25.080 --> 40:27.840\n Well, AI began as the pursuit\n\n40:27.840 --> 40:30.280\n of understanding human intelligence\n\n40:30.280 --> 40:34.160\n and the term itself represents that,\n\n40:34.160 --> 40:37.520\n but it kind of drifted into the one sub area\n\n40:37.520 --> 40:40.840\n that worked extremely well, which is machine intelligence.\n\n40:40.840 --> 40:45.080\n And that's actually more using pattern recognition techniques\n\n40:45.080 --> 40:50.080\n to basically do incredibly well on a limited domain,\n\n40:51.280 --> 40:52.760\n large amount of data,\n\n40:52.760 --> 40:57.120\n but relatively simple kinds of planning tasks\n\n40:57.120 --> 40:58.680\n and not very creative.\n\n40:58.680 --> 41:02.440\n So we didn't end up building human intelligence.\n\n41:02.440 --> 41:04.560\n We built a different machine\n\n41:04.560 --> 41:08.080\n that was a lot better than us, some problems,\n\n41:08.080 --> 41:11.720\n but nowhere close to us on other problems.\n\n41:11.720 --> 41:15.240\n So today, I think a lot of people still misunderstand\n\n41:16.320 --> 41:18.040\n when we say artificial intelligence\n\n41:18.040 --> 41:20.720\n and what various products can do,\n\n41:20.720 --> 41:22.960\n people still think it's about replicating\n\n41:22.960 --> 41:24.200\n human intelligence,\n\n41:24.200 --> 41:27.600\n but the products out there really are closer\n\n41:27.600 --> 41:31.680\n to having invented the internet or the spreadsheet\n\n41:31.680 --> 41:34.440\n or the database and getting broader adoption.\n\n41:35.360 --> 41:37.640\n And speaking further to the fears,\n\n41:37.640 --> 41:40.360\n near term fears that people have about AI,\n\n41:40.360 --> 41:45.080\n so you're commenting on the sort of general intelligence\n\n41:45.080 --> 41:48.080\n that people in the popular culture from sci fi movies\n\n41:48.080 --> 41:49.600\n have a sense about AI,\n\n41:49.600 --> 41:52.000\n but there's practical fears about AI,\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:54.840\n the narrow AI that you're talking about\n\n41:54.840 --> 41:57.280\n of automating particular kinds of jobs\n\n41:57.280 --> 41:59.440\n and you talk about them in the book.\n\n41:59.440 --> 42:01.560\n So what are the kinds of jobs in your view\n\n42:01.560 --> 42:04.480\n that you see in the next five, 10 years\n\n42:04.480 --> 42:09.280\n beginning to be automated by AI systems algorithms?\n\n42:09.280 --> 42:13.040\n Yes, this is also maybe a little bit counterintuitive\n\n42:13.040 --> 42:15.280\n because it's the routine jobs\n\n42:15.280 --> 42:18.360\n that will be displaced the soonest\n\n42:18.360 --> 42:20.880\n and they may not be displaced entirely,\n\n42:20.880 --> 42:24.080\n maybe 50%, 80% of a job,\n\n42:24.080 --> 42:26.320\n but when the workload drops by that much,\n\n42:26.320 --> 42:28.760\n employment will come down.\n\n42:28.760 --> 42:31.520\n And also another part of misunderstanding\n\n42:31.520 --> 42:35.720\n is most people think of AI replacing routine jobs\n\n42:35.720 --> 42:38.760\n than they think of the assembly line, the workers.\n\n42:38.760 --> 42:41.000\n Well, that will have some effect,\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:44.240\n but it's actually the routine white collar workers\n\n42:44.240 --> 42:46.200\n that's easiest to replace\n\n42:46.200 --> 42:49.280\n because to replace a white collar worker,\n\n42:49.280 --> 42:50.720\n you just need software.\n\n42:50.720 --> 42:53.120\n To replace a blue collar worker,\n\n42:53.120 --> 42:57.200\n you need robotics, mechanical excellence,\n\n42:57.200 --> 43:01.880\n and the ability to deal with dexterity\n\n43:01.880 --> 43:05.640\n and maybe even unknown environments, very, very difficult.\n\n43:05.640 --> 43:10.600\n So if we were to categorize the most dangerous\n\n43:10.600 --> 43:12.400\n white collar jobs,\n\n43:12.400 --> 43:15.640\n they would be things like back office,\n\n43:15.640 --> 43:17.920\n people who copy and paste\n\n43:17.920 --> 43:22.200\n and deal with simple computer programs and data\n\n43:22.200 --> 43:25.600\n and maybe paper and OCR,\n\n43:25.600 --> 43:29.040\n and they don't make strategic decisions.\n\n43:29.040 --> 43:32.040\n They basically facilitate the process.\n\n43:32.040 --> 43:34.600\n These softwares and paper systems don't work.\n\n43:34.600 --> 43:39.400\n So you have people dealing with new employee orientation,\n\n43:40.520 --> 43:44.320\n searching for past lawsuits and financial documents,\n\n43:45.200 --> 43:47.920\n and doing reference check.\n\n43:47.920 --> 43:50.960\n So basic searching and management of data.\n\n43:50.960 --> 43:52.800\n That's the most endangered being lost.\n\n43:52.800 --> 43:56.440\n In addition to the white collar repetitive work,\n\n43:56.440 --> 44:00.240\n a lot of simple interaction work can also be taken care of\n\n44:00.240 --> 44:04.840\n such as telesales, telemarketing, customer service,\n\n44:04.840 --> 44:07.280\n as well as many physical jobs\n\n44:07.280 --> 44:09.520\n that are in the same location\n\n44:09.520 --> 44:12.200\n and don't require a high degree of dexterity.\n\n44:12.200 --> 44:17.200\n So fruit picking, dishwashing, assembly line inspection\n\n44:17.840 --> 44:20.320\n are jobs in that category.\n\n44:20.320 --> 44:24.440\n So altogether, back office is a big part.\n\n44:25.400 --> 44:29.840\n And the blue collar may be smaller initially,\n\n44:29.840 --> 44:32.520\n but over time, AI will get better.\n\n44:32.520 --> 44:36.880\n And when we start to get to over the next 15, 20 years,\n\n44:36.880 --> 44:39.120\n the ability to actually have the dexterity\n\n44:39.120 --> 44:42.600\n of doing assembly line, that's a huge chunk of jobs.\n\n44:42.600 --> 44:45.600\n And when autonomous vehicles start to work,\n\n44:45.600 --> 44:47.440\n initially starting with truck drivers,\n\n44:47.440 --> 44:49.360\n but eventually to all drivers,\n\n44:49.360 --> 44:52.000\n that's another huge group of workers.\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:55.600\n So I see modest numbers in the next five years,\n\n44:55.600 --> 44:58.080\n but increasing rapidly after that.\n\n44:58.080 --> 45:01.240\n On the worry of the jobs that are in danger\n\n45:01.240 --> 45:03.080\n and the gradual loss of jobs,\n\n45:04.080 --> 45:06.680\n I'm not sure if you're familiar with Andrew Yang.\n\n45:06.680 --> 45:07.840\n Yes, I am.\n\n45:07.840 --> 45:10.600\n So there's a candidate for president of the United States\n\n45:10.600 --> 45:14.400\n whose platform Andrew Yang is based around,\n\n45:14.400 --> 45:17.720\n in part around job loss due to automation.\n\n45:17.720 --> 45:19.600\n And also in addition,\n\n45:19.600 --> 45:22.600\n the need perhaps of universal basic income\n\n45:22.600 --> 45:25.280\n to support jobs that are,\n\n45:25.280 --> 45:28.600\n folks who lose their job due to automation and so on.\n\n45:28.600 --> 45:30.400\n And in general, support people\n\n45:30.400 --> 45:34.360\n under complex, unstable job market.\n\n45:34.360 --> 45:36.760\n So what are your thoughts about his concerns,\n\n45:36.760 --> 45:39.160\n him as a candidate, his ideas in general?\n\n45:40.080 --> 45:43.440\n I think his thinking is generally in the right direction,\n\n45:44.680 --> 45:48.480\n but his approach as a presidential candidate\n\n45:48.480 --> 45:51.040\n may be a little bit ahead of the time.\n\n45:51.040 --> 45:55.200\n And I think the displacements will happen,\n\n45:56.120 --> 45:57.800\n but will they happen soon enough\n\n45:57.800 --> 46:00.480\n for people to agree to vote for him?\n\n46:00.480 --> 46:03.800\n The unemployment numbers are not very high yet.\n\n46:03.800 --> 46:07.600\n And I think he and I have the same challenge.\n\n46:07.600 --> 46:11.560\n If I want to theoretically convince people this is an issue\n\n46:11.560 --> 46:13.920\n and he wants to become the president,\n\n46:13.920 --> 46:17.520\n people have to see how can this be the case\n\n46:17.520 --> 46:19.720\n when unemployment numbers are low.\n\n46:19.720 --> 46:21.400\n So that is the challenge.\n\n46:21.400 --> 46:26.400\n And I think I do agree with him on the displacement issue,\n\n46:27.080 --> 46:29.080\n on universal basic income.\n\n46:30.280 --> 46:33.920\n At a very vanilla level, I don't agree with it\n\n46:33.920 --> 46:38.360\n because I think the main issue is retraining.\n\n46:38.360 --> 46:41.520\n So people need to be incented\n\n46:41.520 --> 46:45.480\n not by just giving a monthly $2,000 check or $1,000 check\n\n46:45.480 --> 46:47.160\n and do whatever they want\n\n46:47.160 --> 46:50.960\n because they don't have the know how\n\n46:50.960 --> 46:55.960\n to know what to retrain to go into what type of a job.\n\n46:56.840 --> 46:58.640\n And guidance is needed.\n\n46:58.640 --> 47:00.440\n And retraining is needed\n\n47:00.440 --> 47:03.160\n because historically when technology revolutions,\n\n47:03.160 --> 47:06.880\n when routine jobs were displaced, new routine jobs came up.\n\n47:06.880 --> 47:09.400\n So there was always room for that.\n\n47:09.400 --> 47:11.840\n But with AI and automation,\n\n47:11.840 --> 47:15.320\n the whole point is replacing all routine jobs eventually.\n\n47:15.320 --> 47:17.840\n So there will be fewer and fewer routine jobs.\n\n47:17.840 --> 47:22.640\n And AI will create jobs, but it won't create routine jobs\n\n47:22.640 --> 47:24.840\n because if it creates routine jobs,\n\n47:24.840 --> 47:26.880\n why wouldn't AI just do it?\n\n47:26.880 --> 47:30.360\n So therefore the people who are losing the jobs\n\n47:30.360 --> 47:32.280\n are losing routine jobs.\n\n47:32.280 --> 47:35.680\n The jobs that are becoming available are non routine jobs.\n\n47:35.680 --> 47:39.280\n So the social stipend needs to be put in place\n\n47:39.280 --> 47:42.040\n is for the routine workers who lost their jobs\n\n47:42.040 --> 47:46.120\n to be retrained maybe in six months, maybe in three years,\n\n47:46.120 --> 47:48.560\n takes a while to retrain on the non routine job\n\n47:48.560 --> 47:51.360\n and then take on a job that will last\n\n47:51.360 --> 47:53.360\n for that person's lifetime.\n\n47:53.360 --> 47:55.280\n Now, having said that,\n\n47:55.280 --> 47:57.120\n if you look deeply into Andrew's document,\n\n47:57.120 --> 47:58.200\n he does cater for that.\n\n47:58.200 --> 48:03.200\n So I'm not disagreeing with what he's trying to do.\n\n48:03.280 --> 48:06.320\n But for simplification, sometimes he just says UBI,\n\n48:06.320 --> 48:08.720\n but simple UBI wouldn't work.\n\n48:08.720 --> 48:10.560\n And I think you've mentioned elsewhere\n\n48:10.560 --> 48:15.560\n that the goal isn't necessarily to give people enough money\n\n48:15.720 --> 48:19.080\n to survive or live, or even to prosper.\n\n48:19.080 --> 48:22.760\n The point is to give them a job that gives them meaning.\n\n48:22.760 --> 48:24.560\n That meaning is extremely important.\n\n48:25.560 --> 48:28.560\n That our employment, at least in the United States\n\n48:28.560 --> 48:31.120\n and perhaps it carries across the world,\n\n48:31.120 --> 48:34.520\n provides something that's, forgive me for saying,\n\n48:34.520 --> 48:35.600\n greater than money.\n\n48:35.600 --> 48:36.880\n It provides meaning.\n\n48:36.880 --> 48:41.880\n So now, what kind of jobs do you think can't be automated?\n\n48:43.280 --> 48:45.080\n Can you talk a little bit about creativity\n\n48:45.080 --> 48:46.640\n and compassion in your book?\n\n48:46.640 --> 48:49.640\n What aspects do you think it's difficult to automate\n\n48:49.640 --> 48:50.800\n for an AI system?\n\n48:51.920 --> 48:56.440\n Because an AI system is currently merely optimizing.\n\n48:56.440 --> 48:59.240\n It's not able to reason, plan,\n\n48:59.240 --> 49:02.040\n or think creatively or strategically.\n\n49:02.040 --> 49:04.400\n It's not able to deal with complex problems.\n\n49:04.400 --> 49:08.800\n It can't come up with a new problem and solve it.\n\n49:08.800 --> 49:11.480\n A human needs to find the problem\n\n49:11.480 --> 49:14.760\n and pose it as an optimization problem,\n\n49:14.760 --> 49:16.640\n then have the AI work at it.\n\n49:16.640 --> 49:21.640\n So an AI would have a very hard time discovering a new drug\n\n49:22.360 --> 49:25.400\n or discovering a new style of painting\n\n49:26.440 --> 49:31.440\n or dealing with complex tasks such as managing a company\n\n49:31.440 --> 49:34.440\n that isn't just about optimizing the bottom line,\n\n49:34.440 --> 49:38.000\n but also about employee satisfaction, corporate brand,\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:39.840\n and many, many other things.\n\n49:39.840 --> 49:43.400\n So that is one category of things.\n\n49:43.400 --> 49:47.360\n And because these things are challenging, creative, complex,\n\n49:47.360 --> 49:51.160\n doing them creates a high degree of satisfaction\n\n49:51.160 --> 49:54.480\n and therefore appealing to our desire for working,\n\n49:54.480 --> 49:57.360\n which isn't just to make the money, make the ends meet,\n\n49:57.360 --> 49:59.560\n but also that we've accomplished something\n\n49:59.560 --> 50:02.320\n that others maybe can't do or can't do as well.\n\n50:03.320 --> 50:06.320\n Another type of job that is much numerous\n\n50:06.320 --> 50:10.240\n would be compassionate jobs, jobs that require compassion,\n\n50:10.240 --> 50:13.600\n empathy, human touch, human trust.\n\n50:13.600 --> 50:17.760\n AI can't do that because AI is cold, calculating,\n\n50:17.760 --> 50:21.920\n and even if it can fake that to some extent,\n\n50:21.920 --> 50:25.120\n it will make errors and that will make it look very silly.\n\n50:25.120 --> 50:28.320\n And also, I think even if AI did okay,\n\n50:28.320 --> 50:32.000\n people would want to interact with another person,\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:35.920\n whether it's for some kind of a service or a teacher\n\n50:35.920 --> 50:40.920\n or a doctor or a concierge or a masseuse or a bartender.\n\n50:40.920 --> 50:44.440\n There are so many jobs where people just don't want\n\n50:44.440 --> 50:48.000\n to interact with a cold robot or software.\n\n50:49.400 --> 50:52.480\n I've had an entrepreneur who built an elderly care robot\n\n50:52.480 --> 50:55.240\n and they found that the elderly really only use it\n\n50:55.240 --> 50:56.880\n for customer service.\n\n50:56.880 --> 50:59.480\n And not, but not to service the product,\n\n50:59.480 --> 51:01.840\n but they click on customer service\n\n51:01.840 --> 51:04.120\n and the video of a person comes up\n\n51:04.120 --> 51:05.960\n and then the person says,\n\n51:05.960 --> 51:08.080\n how come my daughter didn't call me?\n\n51:08.080 --> 51:10.240\n Let me show you a picture of her grandkids.\n\n51:10.240 --> 51:14.000\n So people yearn for that people, people interaction.\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:17.840\n So even if robots improved, people just don't want it.\n\n51:17.840 --> 51:20.120\n And those jobs are going to be increasing\n\n51:20.120 --> 51:22.840\n because AI will create a lot of value,\n\n51:22.840 --> 51:26.640\n $16 trillion to the world in the next 10 years.\n\n51:26.640 --> 51:29.520\n Next 11 years, according to PWC.\n\n51:29.520 --> 51:34.520\n And that will give people money to enjoy services,\n\n51:34.640 --> 51:39.640\n whether it's eating a gourmet meal or tourism and traveling\n\n51:39.680 --> 51:41.480\n or having concierge services,\n\n51:41.480 --> 51:45.600\n the services revolving around every dollar\n\n51:45.600 --> 51:48.080\n of that $16 trillion will be tremendous.\n\n51:48.080 --> 51:50.080\n It will create more opportunities\n\n51:50.080 --> 51:52.800\n that are to service the people who did well\n\n51:52.800 --> 51:56.240\n through AI with things.\n\n51:56.240 --> 51:58.280\n But even at the same time,\n\n51:58.280 --> 52:01.720\n the entire society is very much short\n\n52:01.720 --> 52:04.240\n in need of many service oriented,\n\n52:04.240 --> 52:06.200\n compassionate oriented jobs.\n\n52:06.200 --> 52:10.360\n The best example is probably in healthcare services.\n\n52:10.360 --> 52:14.320\n There's going to be 2 million new jobs,\n\n52:14.320 --> 52:15.400\n not counting replacement,\n\n52:15.400 --> 52:17.520\n just brand new incremental jobs\n\n52:17.520 --> 52:20.560\n in the next six years in healthcare services.\n\n52:20.560 --> 52:25.000\n That includes nurses, orderly in the hospital,\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:30.000\n elderly care and also at home care is particularly lacking.\n\n52:31.480 --> 52:34.840\n And those jobs are not likely to be filled.\n\n52:34.840 --> 52:36.840\n So there's likely to be a shortage.\n\n52:36.840 --> 52:38.600\n And the reason they're not filled\n\n52:38.600 --> 52:41.600\n is simply because they don't pay very well\n\n52:41.600 --> 52:46.600\n and that the social status of these jobs are not very good.\n\n52:47.520 --> 52:49.720\n So they pay about half as much\n\n52:49.720 --> 52:52.160\n as a heavy equipment operator,\n\n52:52.160 --> 52:55.600\n which will be replaced a lot sooner.\n\n52:55.600 --> 52:57.560\n And they pay probably comparably\n\n52:57.560 --> 52:59.880\n to someone on the assembly line.\n\n52:59.880 --> 53:03.480\n And so if we ignoring all the other issues\n\n53:03.480 --> 53:07.160\n and just think about satisfaction from one's job,\n\n53:07.160 --> 53:10.520\n someone repetitively doing the same manual action\n\n53:10.520 --> 53:11.640\n at an assembly line,\n\n53:11.640 --> 53:14.640\n that can't create a lot of job satisfaction,\n\n53:14.640 --> 53:17.680\n but someone taking care of a sick person\n\n53:17.680 --> 53:19.600\n and getting a hug and thank you\n\n53:19.600 --> 53:22.000\n from that person and the family,\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:24.680\n I think is quite satisfying.\n\n53:24.680 --> 53:28.720\n So if only we could fix the pay for service jobs,\n\n53:28.720 --> 53:31.880\n there are plenty of jobs that require some training\n\n53:31.880 --> 53:33.400\n or a lot of training\n\n53:33.400 --> 53:36.960\n for the people coming off the routine jobs to take.\n\n53:36.960 --> 53:40.320\n We can easily imagine someone\n\n53:40.320 --> 53:43.480\n who was maybe a cashier at the grocery store\n\n53:43.480 --> 53:45.640\n as stores become automated,\n\n53:45.640 --> 53:49.160\n learns to become a nurse or an at home care.\n\n53:49.160 --> 53:52.760\n I also do want to point out the blue collar jobs\n\n53:52.760 --> 53:54.720\n are going to stay around a bit longer.\n\n53:54.720 --> 53:56.440\n Some of them quite a bit longer.\n\n53:58.120 --> 54:02.200\n AI cannot be told go clean an arbitrary home.\n\n54:02.200 --> 54:03.920\n That's incredibly hard.\n\n54:03.920 --> 54:07.560\n Arguably it's an L5 level of difficulty, right?\n\n54:07.560 --> 54:10.080\n And then AI cannot be a good plumber\n\n54:10.080 --> 54:12.840\n because plumber is almost like a mini detective\n\n54:12.840 --> 54:15.640\n that has to figure out where the leak came from.\n\n54:15.640 --> 54:20.200\n So yet AI probably can be an assembly line\n\n54:20.200 --> 54:22.800\n and auto mechanic and so on.\n\n54:22.800 --> 54:26.760\n So one has to study which blue collar jobs are going away\n\n54:26.760 --> 54:29.240\n and facilitate retraining for the people\n\n54:29.240 --> 54:31.120\n to go into the ones that won't go away\n\n54:31.120 --> 54:32.960\n or maybe even will increase.\n\n54:32.960 --> 54:35.000\n I mean, it is fascinating that it's easier\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:39.480\n to build a world champion chess player\n\n54:39.480 --> 54:42.040\n than it is to build a mediocre plumber.\n\n54:42.040 --> 54:43.160\n Yes, right.\n\n54:43.160 --> 54:44.000\n Very true.\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.160\n And to AI and that goes counterintuitive\n\n54:46.160 --> 54:48.000\n to a lot of people's understanding\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:50.120\n of what artificial intelligence is.\n\n54:50.120 --> 54:52.480\n So it sounds, I mean, you're painting\n\n54:52.480 --> 54:55.400\n a pretty optimistic picture about retraining\n\n54:55.400 --> 54:57.000\n about the number of jobs\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.560\n and actually the meaningful nature of those jobs\n\n54:59.560 --> 55:02.080\n once we automate the repetitive tasks.\n\n55:02.080 --> 55:07.080\n So overall, are you optimistic about the future\n\n55:08.160 --> 55:11.640\n where much of the repetitive tasks are automated?\n\n55:11.640 --> 55:13.840\n That there is a lot of room for humans\n\n55:13.840 --> 55:17.360\n for the compassionate, for the creative input\n\n55:17.360 --> 55:20.080\n that only humans can provide?\n\n55:20.080 --> 55:23.400\n I am optimistic if we start to take action.\n\n55:23.400 --> 55:27.640\n If we have no action in the next five years,\n\n55:27.640 --> 55:30.760\n I think it's going to be hard to deal\n\n55:30.760 --> 55:34.200\n with the devastating losses that will emerge.\n\n55:34.200 --> 55:37.120\n So if we start thinking about retraining,\n\n55:37.120 --> 55:39.360\n maybe with the low hanging fruits,\n\n55:39.360 --> 55:41.800\n explaining to vocational schools\n\n55:41.800 --> 55:45.760\n why they should train more plumbers than auto mechanics,\n\n55:46.640 --> 55:49.680\n maybe starting with some government subsidy\n\n55:49.680 --> 55:53.600\n for corporations to have more training positions.\n\n55:53.600 --> 55:58.160\n We start to explain to people why retraining is important.\n\n55:58.160 --> 56:00.760\n We start to think about what the future of education,\n\n56:00.760 --> 56:04.560\n how that needs to be tweaked for the era of AI.\n\n56:04.560 --> 56:06.760\n If we start to make incremental progress\n\n56:06.760 --> 56:08.960\n and the greater number of people understand,\n\n56:08.960 --> 56:12.360\n then there's no reason to think we can't deal with this\n\n56:12.360 --> 56:14.360\n because this technological revolution\n\n56:14.360 --> 56:17.280\n is arguably similar to what electricity,\n\n56:17.280 --> 56:20.440\n industrial revolutions, and internet brought about.\n\n56:20.440 --> 56:22.680\n Do you think there's a role for policy,\n\n56:22.680 --> 56:24.640\n for governments to step in,\n\n56:24.640 --> 56:28.000\n to help with policy to create a better world?\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:32.280\n Absolutely, and the governments don't have to believe\n\n56:32.280 --> 56:34.040\n an employment will go up,\n\n56:34.040 --> 56:37.560\n and they don't have to believe automation will be this fast\n\n56:37.560 --> 56:39.440\n to do something.\n\n56:39.440 --> 56:42.520\n Revamping vocational school would be one example.\n\n56:42.520 --> 56:44.760\n Another is if there's a big gap\n\n56:44.760 --> 56:47.480\n in healthcare service employment,\n\n56:47.480 --> 56:51.840\n and we know that a country's population is growing older,\n\n56:51.840 --> 56:54.280\n more longevity, living older,\n\n56:54.280 --> 56:57.560\n because people over 80 require five times as much care\n\n56:57.560 --> 56:59.680\n as those under 80,\n\n56:59.680 --> 57:03.480\n then it is a good time to incent training programs\n\n57:03.480 --> 57:07.600\n for elderly care to find ways to improve the pay.\n\n57:07.600 --> 57:11.720\n Maybe one way would be to offer as part of Medicare\n\n57:11.720 --> 57:14.600\n or the equivalent program for people over 80\n\n57:14.600 --> 57:18.760\n to be entitled to a few hours of elderly care at home,\n\n57:18.760 --> 57:22.160\n and then that might be reimbursable,\n\n57:22.160 --> 57:26.720\n and that will stimulate the service industry\n\n57:26.720 --> 57:28.920\n around the policy.\n\n57:28.920 --> 57:33.400\n Do you have concerns about large entities,\n\n57:33.400 --> 57:35.480\n whether it's governments or companies,\n\n57:35.480 --> 57:39.240\n controlling the future of AI development in general?\n\n57:39.240 --> 57:41.000\n So we talked about companies.\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:44.360\n Do you have a better sense that governments\n\n57:44.360 --> 57:49.360\n can better represent the interests of the people\n\n57:49.480 --> 57:52.320\n than companies, or do you believe companies\n\n57:52.320 --> 57:54.960\n are better at representing the interests of the people?\n\n57:54.960 --> 57:56.840\n Or is there no easy answer?\n\n57:56.840 --> 57:58.120\n I don't think there's an easy answer\n\n57:58.120 --> 58:00.200\n because it's a double edged sword.\n\n58:00.200 --> 58:03.760\n The companies and governments can provide better services\n\n58:03.760 --> 58:06.760\n with more access to data and more access to AI,\n\n58:06.760 --> 58:09.440\n but that also leads to greater power,\n\n58:09.440 --> 58:13.600\n which can lead to uncontrollable problems,\n\n58:13.600 --> 58:17.760\n whether it's monopoly or corruption in the government.\n\n58:17.760 --> 58:21.400\n So I think one has to be careful\n\n58:21.400 --> 58:25.040\n to look at how much data that companies and governments have\n\n58:25.040 --> 58:30.040\n and some kind of checks and balances would be helpful.\n\n58:30.400 --> 58:34.040\n So again, I come from Russia.\n\n58:34.040 --> 58:35.960\n There's something called the Cold War.\n\n58:36.840 --> 58:39.240\n So let me ask a difficult question here\n\n58:39.240 --> 58:40.720\n looking at conflict.\n\n58:40.720 --> 58:42.160\n Steven Pinker written a great book\n\n58:42.160 --> 58:45.440\n that conflict all over the world is decreasing in general.\n\n58:45.440 --> 58:49.680\n But do you have a sense that having written\n\n58:49.680 --> 58:51.800\n the book AI Superpowers,\n\n58:51.800 --> 58:54.440\n do you see a major international conflict\n\n58:54.440 --> 58:57.840\n potentially arising between major nations,\n\n58:57.840 --> 59:00.400\n whatever they are, whether it's Russia, China,\n\n59:00.400 --> 59:04.120\n European nations, United States or others\n\n59:04.120 --> 59:07.720\n in the next 10, 20, 50 years around AI,\n\n59:07.720 --> 59:10.200\n around the digital space, cyberspace?\n\n59:10.200 --> 59:12.120\n Do you worry about that?\n\n59:12.120 --> 59:15.520\n Is that something we need to think about\n\n59:15.520 --> 59:18.640\n and try to alleviate or prevent?\n\n59:19.600 --> 59:22.680\n I believe in greater engagement.\n\n59:22.680 --> 59:26.720\n A lot of the worries about more powerful AI\n\n59:26.720 --> 59:31.720\n are based on a arms race metaphor.\n\n59:33.280 --> 59:38.280\n And when you extrapolate into military kinds of scenarios,\n\n59:41.560 --> 59:46.560\n AI can automate and autonomous weapons\n\n59:46.560 --> 59:48.800\n that needs to be controlled somehow\n\n59:48.800 --> 59:51.640\n and autonomous decision making\n\n59:51.640 --> 59:56.640\n can lead to not enough time to fix international crises.\n\n59:57.560 --> 1:00:00.880\n So I actually believe a Cold War mentality\n\n1:00:00.880 --> 1:00:02.480\n would be very dangerous\n\n1:00:02.480 --> 1:00:05.560\n because should two countries rely on AI\n\n1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:07.400\n to make certain decisions\n\n1:00:07.400 --> 1:00:10.040\n and they don't even talk to each other,\n\n1:00:10.040 --> 1:00:12.120\n they do their own scenario planning,\n\n1:00:12.120 --> 1:00:15.120\n then something could easily go wrong.\n\n1:00:15.120 --> 1:00:18.960\n I think engagement, interaction, some protocols\n\n1:00:18.960 --> 1:00:23.960\n to avoid inadvertent disasters is actually needed.\n\n1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:29.120\n So it's natural for each country to want to be the best,\n\n1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:34.120\n whether it's in nuclear technologies or AI or bio.\n\n1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:37.720\n But I think it's important to realize\n\n1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:41.360\n if each country has a black box AI\n\n1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:43.280\n and don't talk to each other,\n\n1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:49.280\n that probably presents greater challenges to humanity\n\n1:00:49.280 --> 1:00:51.480\n than if they interacted.\n\n1:00:51.480 --> 1:00:53.760\n I think there can still be competition,\n\n1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:57.080\n but with some degree of protocol for interaction,\n\n1:00:57.080 --> 1:01:02.080\n just like when there was a nuclear competition,\n\n1:01:02.160 --> 1:01:04.880\n there were some protocol for deterrence\n\n1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:08.000\n among US, Russia, and China.\n\n1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.880\n And I think that engagement is needed.\n\n1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:13.520\n So of course, we're still far from AI\n\n1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:16.000\n presenting that kind of danger.\n\n1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.400\n But what I worry the most about\n\n1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:23.000\n is the level of engagement seems to be coming down.\n\n1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.360\n The level of distrust seems to be going up,\n\n1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:30.240\n especially from the US towards other large countries\n\n1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:33.400\n such as China and of course, and Russia, yes.\n\n1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:34.680\n Is there a way to make that better?\n\n1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:37.240\n So let's beautifully put level of engagement\n\n1:01:37.240 --> 1:01:40.680\n and even just basic trust and communication\n\n1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:45.680\n as opposed to sort of making artificial enemies\n\n1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:52.520\n out of particular countries.\n\n1:01:53.360 --> 1:01:57.160\n Do you have a sense how we can make it better?\n\n1:01:57.160 --> 1:02:01.720\n Actionable items that as a society we can take on?\n\n1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:05.000\n I'm not an expert at geopolitics,\n\n1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:10.800\n but I would say that we look pretty foolish as humankind\n\n1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:13.200\n when we are faced with the opportunity\n\n1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:19.520\n to create $16 trillion for humanity,\n\n1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:26.040\n and yet we're not solving fundamental problems\n\n1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:29.520\n with parts of the world still in poverty.\n\n1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:31.320\n And for the first time,\n\n1:02:31.320 --> 1:02:34.600\n we have the resources to overcome poverty and hunger.\n\n1:02:34.600 --> 1:02:35.960\n We're not using it on that,\n\n1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:38.800\n but we're fueling competition among superpowers.\n\n1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:41.880\n And that's a very unfortunate thing.\n\n1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:44.760\n If we become utopian for a moment,\n\n1:02:44.760 --> 1:02:52.240\n imagine a benevolent world government\n\n1:02:52.240 --> 1:02:56.120\n that has this $16 trillion and maybe some AI\n\n1:02:56.120 --> 1:02:59.280\n to figure out how to use it to deal with diseases\n\n1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:02.640\n and problems and hate and things like that.\n\n1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:04.840\n World would be a lot better off.\n\n1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:07.600\n So what is wrong with the current world?\n\n1:03:07.600 --> 1:03:11.040\n I think the people with more skill than I\n\n1:03:11.040 --> 1:03:13.920\n should think about this.\n\n1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:16.920\n And then the geopolitics issue with superpower competition\n\n1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:19.360\n is one side of the issue.\n\n1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:24.040\n There's another side which I worry maybe even more,\n\n1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:29.360\n which is as the $16 trillion all gets made by US and China\n\n1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:32.040\n and a few of the other developed countries,\n\n1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:34.280\n the poorer country will get nothing\n\n1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:36.880\n because they don't have technology\n\n1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:42.440\n and the wealth disparity and inequality will increase.\n\n1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:45.880\n So a poorer country with a large population\n\n1:03:45.880 --> 1:03:48.520\n will not only benefit from the AI boom\n\n1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:50.360\n or other technology booms,\n\n1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:52.360\n but they will have their workers\n\n1:03:52.360 --> 1:03:56.040\n who previously had hoped they could do the China model\n\n1:03:56.040 --> 1:03:58.840\n and do outsource manufacturing or the India model\n\n1:03:58.840 --> 1:04:02.640\n so they could do the outsource process or call center.\n\n1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:05.800\n Well, all those jobs are gonna be gone in 10 or 15 years.\n\n1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:10.800\n So the individual citizen may be a net liability,\n\n1:04:12.080 --> 1:04:15.040\n I mean, financially speaking to a poorer country\n\n1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:19.800\n and not an asset to claw itself out of poverty.\n\n1:04:19.800 --> 1:04:22.640\n So in that kind of situation,\n\n1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:26.400\n these large countries with not much tech\n\n1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:30.080\n are going to be facing a downward spiral\n\n1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:33.120\n and it's unclear what could be done.\n\n1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:34.720\n And then when we look back\n\n1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:37.600\n and say there's $16 trillion being created\n\n1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:39.720\n and it's all being kept by US, China\n\n1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:43.360\n and other developed countries, it just doesn't feel right.\n\n1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:46.920\n So I hope people who know about geopolitics\n\n1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:49.960\n can find solutions that's beyond my expertise.\n\n1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:53.160\n So different countries that we've talked about\n\n1:04:53.160 --> 1:04:55.200\n have different value systems.\n\n1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:56.920\n If you look at the United States,\n\n1:04:56.920 --> 1:04:58.960\n to an almost extreme degree,\n\n1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:03.400\n there is an absolute desire for freedom of speech.\n\n1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:05.160\n If you look at a country where I was raised,\n\n1:05:05.160 --> 1:05:06.960\n that desire just amongst the people\n\n1:05:06.960 --> 1:05:11.960\n is not as elevated as it is to basically fundamental level\n\n1:05:15.040 --> 1:05:17.560\n to the essence of what it means to be America, right?\n\n1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:19.160\n And the same is true with China,\n\n1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:21.480\n there's different value systems.\n\n1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:26.480\n There's some censorship of internet content\n\n1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:31.280\n that China and Russia and many other countries undertake.\n\n1:05:31.280 --> 1:05:36.280\n Do you see that having effects on innovation,\n\n1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:38.880\n other aspects of some of the tech stuff,\n\n1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:40.920\n AI development we talked about,\n\n1:05:40.920 --> 1:05:42.520\n and maybe from another angle,\n\n1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:46.200\n do you see that changing in different ways\n\n1:05:46.200 --> 1:05:49.560\n over the next 10 years, 20 years, 50 years\n\n1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:53.000\n as China continues to grow as it does now\n\n1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:54.840\n in its tech innovation?\n\n1:05:55.720 --> 1:05:57.200\n There's a common belief\n\n1:05:57.200 --> 1:06:01.040\n that full freedom of speech and expression\n\n1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:03.040\n is correlated with creativity,\n\n1:06:03.040 --> 1:06:08.040\n which is correlated with entrepreneurial success.\n\n1:06:08.520 --> 1:06:13.200\n I think empirically we have seen that is not true\n\n1:06:13.200 --> 1:06:15.600\n and China has been successful.\n\n1:06:15.600 --> 1:06:19.600\n That's not to say the fundamental values are not right\n\n1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:20.840\n or not the best,\n\n1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:25.040\n but it's just that perfect correlation isn't there.\n\n1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:30.560\n It's hard to read the tea leaves on opening up or not\n\n1:06:30.560 --> 1:06:31.720\n in any country,\n\n1:06:31.720 --> 1:06:35.880\n and I've not been very good at that in my past predictions,\n\n1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:40.840\n but I do believe every country\n\n1:06:40.840 --> 1:06:45.840\n shares a lot of fundamental values for the longterm.\n\n1:06:47.440 --> 1:06:52.440\n So China is drafting its privacy policy\n\n1:06:54.480 --> 1:06:57.240\n for individual citizens,\n\n1:06:57.240 --> 1:07:00.000\n and they don't look that different\n\n1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:03.240\n from the American or European ones.\n\n1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:07.600\n So people do want to protect their privacy\n\n1:07:07.600 --> 1:07:10.680\n and have the opportunity to express\n\n1:07:10.680 --> 1:07:14.200\n and I think the fundamental values are there.\n\n1:07:14.200 --> 1:07:17.920\n The question is in the execution and timing,\n\n1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:21.760\n how soon or when will that start to open up?\n\n1:07:21.760 --> 1:07:25.520\n So as long as each government knows\n\n1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:28.320\n ultimately people want that kind of protection,\n\n1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:32.240\n there should be a plan to move towards that\n\n1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:35.360\n as to when or how and I'm not an expert.\n\n1:07:36.280 --> 1:07:39.040\n On the point of privacy to me, it's really interesting.\n\n1:07:39.040 --> 1:07:42.520\n So AI needs data to create\n\n1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:45.520\n a personalized awesome experience, right?\n\n1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:48.560\n I'm just speaking generally in terms of products.\n\n1:07:48.560 --> 1:07:51.360\n And then we have currently, depending on the age\n\n1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:54.000\n and depending on the demographics of who we're talking about,\n\n1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:55.840\n some people are more or less concerned\n\n1:07:55.840 --> 1:07:59.040\n about the amount of data they hand over.\n\n1:07:59.040 --> 1:08:04.040\n So in your view, how do we get this balance right\n\n1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:07.120\n that we provide an amazing experience\n\n1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:09.920\n to people that use products?\n\n1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:13.440\n You look at Facebook, the more Facebook knows about you,\n\n1:08:13.440 --> 1:08:18.440\n yes, it's scary to say, the better it can probably,\n\n1:08:19.360 --> 1:08:21.200\n better experience it can probably create.\n\n1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:23.760\n So in your view, how do we get that balance right?\n\n1:08:25.160 --> 1:08:30.160\n Yes, I think a lot of people have a misunderstanding\n\n1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:35.080\n that it's okay and possible to just rip all the data out\n\n1:08:35.080 --> 1:08:38.240\n from a provider and give it back to you.\n\n1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:41.160\n So you can deny them access to further data\n\n1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:44.080\n and still enjoy the services we have.\n\n1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:46.240\n If we take back all the data,\n\n1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:48.360\n all the services will give us nonsense.\n\n1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:52.360\n We'll no longer be able to use products that function well\n\n1:08:52.360 --> 1:08:56.160\n in terms of right ranking, right products,\n\n1:08:56.160 --> 1:08:57.880\n right user experience.\n\n1:08:57.880 --> 1:09:02.880\n So yet I do understand we don't want to permit misuse\n\n1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:07.520\n of the data from legal policy standpoint.\n\n1:09:07.520 --> 1:09:11.160\n I think there can be severe punishment\n\n1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:16.200\n for those who have egregious misuse of the data.\n\n1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:19.600\n That's I think a good first step.\n\n1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:22.680\n Actually China in this side on this aspect\n\n1:09:22.680 --> 1:09:25.480\n has very strong laws about people who sell\n\n1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:27.960\n or give data to other companies.\n\n1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:30.080\n And that over the past few years,\n\n1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:33.560\n since that law came into effect,\n\n1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:38.560\n pretty much eradicated the illegal distribution,\n\n1:09:38.760 --> 1:09:40.560\n sharing of data.\n\n1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:44.120\n Additionally, I think giving,\n\n1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:50.120\n I think technology is often a very good way\n\n1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:52.760\n to solve technology misuse.\n\n1:09:52.760 --> 1:09:56.200\n So can we come up with new technologies\n\n1:09:56.200 --> 1:09:58.880\n that will let us have our cake and eat it too?\n\n1:09:58.880 --> 1:10:01.960\n People are looking into homomorphic encryption,\n\n1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:04.360\n which is letting you keep the data,\n\n1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:07.360\n have it encrypted and train on encrypted data.\n\n1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:09.080\n Of course, we haven't solved that one yet,\n\n1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:12.480\n but that kind of direction may be worth pursuing.\n\n1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:15.160\n Also federated learning,\n\n1:10:15.160 --> 1:10:17.240\n which would allow one hospital\n\n1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:20.000\n to train on its hospital's patient data fully\n\n1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.400\n because they have a license for that.\n\n1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:24.800\n And then hospitals would then share their models,\n\n1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:28.040\n not data, but models to create a super AI.\n\n1:10:28.040 --> 1:10:30.560\n And that also maybe has some promise.\n\n1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:34.160\n So I would want to encourage us to be open minded\n\n1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:39.160\n and think of this as not just the policy binary, yes, no,\n\n1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:42.800\n but letting the technologists try to find solutions\n\n1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:44.840\n to let us have our cake and eat it too,\n\n1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:47.440\n or have most of our cake and eat most of it too.\n\n1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:52.920\n Finally, I think giving each end user a choice is important\n\n1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:55.400\n and having transparency is important.\n\n1:10:55.400 --> 1:10:57.400\n Also, I think that's universal,\n\n1:10:57.400 --> 1:11:00.560\n but the choice you give to the user\n\n1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:02.320\n should not be at a granular level\n\n1:11:02.320 --> 1:11:04.720\n that the user cannot understand.\n\n1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:09.120\n GDPR today causes all these popups of yes, no,\n\n1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:10.560\n will you give this site this right\n\n1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:12.360\n to use this part of your data?\n\n1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:15.000\n I don't think any user understands\n\n1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000\n what they're saying yes or no to.\n\n1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:18.960\n And I suspect most are just saying yes\n\n1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:20.760\n because they don't understand it.\n\n1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:25.600\n So while GDPR in its current implementation\n\n1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:30.360\n has lived up to its promise of transparency and user choice,\n\n1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:33.000\n it implemented it in such a way\n\n1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:38.000\n that really didn't deliver the spirit of GDPR.\n\n1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:41.560\n It fit the letter, but not the spirit.\n\n1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:43.760\n So again, I think we need to think about\n\n1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:48.000\n is there a way to fit the spirit of GDPR\n\n1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.600\n by using some kind of technology?\n\n1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:54.640\n Can we have a slider that's an AI trying to figure out\n\n1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:57.520\n how much you want to slide between\n\n1:11:57.520 --> 1:12:01.520\n perfect protection security of your personal data\n\n1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:04.080\n versus a high degree of convenience\n\n1:12:04.080 --> 1:12:06.960\n with some risks of not having full privacy?\n\n1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:10.080\n Each user should have some preference\n\n1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:12.000\n and that gives you the user choice.\n\n1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.840\n But maybe we should turn the problem on its head\n\n1:12:14.840 --> 1:12:18.840\n and ask can there be an AI algorithm that can customize this?\n\n1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:21.120\n Because we can understand the slider,\n\n1:12:21.120 --> 1:12:25.080\n but we sure cannot understand every popup question.\n\n1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:27.200\n And I think getting that right\n\n1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:29.720\n requires getting the balance between\n\n1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:30.760\n what we talked about earlier,\n\n1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:32.720\n which is heart and soul\n\n1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:37.120\n versus profit driven decisions and strategy.\n\n1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:40.200\n I think from my perspective,\n\n1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:43.080\n the best way to make a lot of money in the long term\n\n1:12:43.080 --> 1:12:45.360\n is to keep your heart and soul intact.\n\n1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:50.640\n I think getting that slider right in the short term\n\n1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:54.080\n may feel like you'll be sacrificing profit,\n\n1:12:54.080 --> 1:12:55.760\n but in the long term,\n\n1:12:55.760 --> 1:12:57.600\n you'll be gaining user trust\n\n1:12:57.600 --> 1:12:59.520\n and providing a great experience.\n\n1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:02.000\n Do you share that kind of view in general?\n\n1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:03.240\n Yes, absolutely.\n\n1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:07.200\n I sure would hope there is a way\n\n1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:09.600\n we can do long term projects\n\n1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:12.000\n that really do the right thing.\n\n1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:15.240\n I think a lot of people who embrace GDPR,\n\n1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:16.960\n their heart's in the right place.\n\n1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:20.680\n I think they just need to figure out how to build a solution.\n\n1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:23.360\n I've heard utopians talk about solutions\n\n1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:24.480\n that get me excited,\n\n1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:27.880\n but I'm not sure how in the current funding environment\n\n1:13:27.880 --> 1:13:29.320\n they can get started.\n\n1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:30.600\n People talk about,\n\n1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:35.600\n imagine this crowdsourced data collection\n\n1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:37.880\n that we all trust.\n\n1:13:37.880 --> 1:13:40.720\n And then we have these agents\n\n1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:45.720\n that we ask the trusted agent to...\n\n1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:48.880\n That agent only, that platform,\n\n1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:51.280\n so a trusted joint platform\n\n1:13:51.280 --> 1:13:55.120\n that we all believe is trustworthy,\n\n1:13:55.120 --> 1:14:00.120\n that can give us all the closed loop personal suggestions\n\n1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:06.200\n by the new social network, new search engine,\n\n1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:08.600\n new eCommerce engine that has access\n\n1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:10.360\n to even more of our data,\n\n1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:12.400\n but not directly, but indirectly.\n\n1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:14.640\n So I think that general concept\n\n1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:18.520\n of licensing to some trusted engine\n\n1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:20.640\n and finding a way to trust that engine\n\n1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:22.360\n seems like a great idea.\n\n1:14:22.360 --> 1:14:24.240\n But if you think how long it's gonna take\n\n1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:27.760\n to implement and tweak and develop it right,\n\n1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:29.920\n as well as to collect all the trusts\n\n1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:31.360\n and the data from the people,\n\n1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:34.960\n it's beyond the current cycle of venture capital.\n\n1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:38.120\n So how do you do that is a big question.\n\n1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:41.840\n You've recently had a fight with cancer,\n\n1:14:41.840 --> 1:14:46.840\n stage four lymphoma and in a sort of deep personal level,\n\n1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:51.080\n what did it feel like in the darker moments\n\n1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:52.880\n to face your own mortality?\n\n1:14:54.840 --> 1:14:57.880\n Well, I've been the workaholic my whole life\n\n1:14:57.880 --> 1:15:01.400\n and I've basically worked nine, nine, six,\n\n1:15:01.400 --> 1:15:04.640\n nine a.m. to nine p.m. six days a week, roughly.\n\n1:15:04.640 --> 1:15:07.920\n And I didn't really pay a lot of attention\n\n1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:10.680\n to my family, friends, and people who loved me.\n\n1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:14.480\n And my life revolved around optimizing for work.\n\n1:15:14.480 --> 1:15:16.920\n While my work was not routine,\n\n1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:21.800\n my optimization really what made my life\n\n1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:25.640\n basically very mechanical process.\n\n1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:28.360\n But I got a lot of highs out of it\n\n1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:30.960\n because of accomplishments\n\n1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:34.400\n that I thought were really important and dear\n\n1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:36.720\n and the highest priority to me.\n\n1:15:36.720 --> 1:15:38.560\n But when I faced mortality\n\n1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:41.960\n and the possible death in matter of months,\n\n1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:45.600\n I suddenly realized that this really meant nothing to me,\n\n1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:48.560\n that I didn't feel like working for another minute,\n\n1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:51.000\n that if I had six months left in my life,\n\n1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:54.280\n I would spend it all with my loved ones\n\n1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:57.480\n and thanking them, giving them love back\n\n1:15:57.480 --> 1:16:01.960\n and apologizing to them that I lived my life the wrong way.\n\n1:16:01.960 --> 1:16:05.960\n So that moment of reckoning\n\n1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:10.960\n caused me to really rethink that why we exist in this world\n\n1:16:11.520 --> 1:16:16.520\n is something that we might be too much shaped by the society\n\n1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:22.040\n to think that success and accomplishments is why we live.\n\n1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:26.320\n But while that can get you\n\n1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:29.680\n periodic successes and satisfaction,\n\n1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:33.200\n it's really in the facing death\n\n1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:35.840\n you see what's truly important to you.\n\n1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:40.840\n So as a result of going through the challenges with cancer,\n\n1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:45.720\n I've resolved to live a more balanced lifestyle.\n\n1:16:45.720 --> 1:16:48.920\n I'm now in remission, knock on wood,\n\n1:16:48.920 --> 1:16:52.440\n and I'm spending more time with my family.\n\n1:16:52.440 --> 1:16:54.800\n My wife travels with me.\n\n1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:58.000\n When my kids need me, I spend more time with them.\n\n1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:02.680\n And before I used to prioritize everything around work.\n\n1:17:02.680 --> 1:17:03.960\n When I had a little bit of time,\n\n1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:06.240\n I would dole it out to my family.\n\n1:17:06.240 --> 1:17:09.880\n Now, when my family needs something, really needs something,\n\n1:17:09.880 --> 1:17:12.640\n I drop everything at work and go to them.\n\n1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:15.880\n And then in the time remaining, I allocate to work.\n\n1:17:15.880 --> 1:17:19.000\n But one's family is very understanding.\n\n1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:23.160\n It's not like they will take 50 hours a week from me.\n\n1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:27.120\n So I'm actually able to still work pretty hard,\n\n1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:29.280\n maybe 10 hours less per week.\n\n1:17:29.280 --> 1:17:32.720\n So I realized the most important thing in my life\n\n1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:36.280\n is really love and the people I love.\n\n1:17:36.280 --> 1:17:38.680\n And I give that the highest priority.\n\n1:17:38.680 --> 1:17:40.680\n It isn't the only thing I do,\n\n1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:45.680\n but when that is needed, I put that at the top priority\n\n1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:50.080\n and I feel much better and I feel much more balanced.\n\n1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:53.080\n And I think this also gives a hint\n\n1:17:53.080 --> 1:17:58.080\n as to a life of routine work, a life of pursuit of numbers.\n\n1:17:58.080 --> 1:18:02.920\n While my job was not routine, it was in pursuit of numbers,\n\n1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:04.960\n pursuit of can I make more money?\n\n1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:07.360\n Can I fund more great companies?\n\n1:18:07.360 --> 1:18:08.920\n Can I raise more money?\n\n1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:12.080\n Can I make sure our VC is ranked higher and higher\n\n1:18:12.080 --> 1:18:13.360\n every year?\n\n1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:18.360\n This competitive nature of driving for bigger numbers\n\n1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:23.800\n and better numbers became a endless pursuit\n\n1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:26.640\n that's mechanical.\n\n1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:31.640\n And bigger numbers really didn't make me happier.\n\n1:18:31.880 --> 1:18:34.680\n And faced with death, I realized bigger numbers\n\n1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:36.360\n really meant nothing.\n\n1:18:36.360 --> 1:18:41.040\n And what was important is that people who have given\n\n1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:42.840\n their heart and their love to me\n\n1:18:42.840 --> 1:18:45.640\n deserve for me to do the same.\n\n1:18:45.640 --> 1:18:48.400\n So there's deep, profound truth in that,\n\n1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:52.000\n that everyone should hear and internalize.\n\n1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:55.420\n I mean, that's really powerful for you to say that.\n\n1:18:55.420 --> 1:19:00.420\n I have to ask sort of a difficult question here.\n\n1:19:03.060 --> 1:19:06.020\n So I've competed in sports my whole life,\n\n1:19:06.020 --> 1:19:11.020\n looking historically, I'd like to challenge some aspect\n\n1:19:11.780 --> 1:19:15.220\n of that a little bit on the point of hard work.\n\n1:19:15.220 --> 1:19:18.900\n That it feels that there are certain aspects\n\n1:19:18.900 --> 1:19:22.020\n that is the greatest, the most beautiful aspects\n\n1:19:22.020 --> 1:19:26.440\n of human nature is the ability to become obsessed,\n\n1:19:27.740 --> 1:19:31.460\n of becoming extremely passionate to the point where yes,\n\n1:19:31.460 --> 1:19:36.460\n flaws are revealed and just giving yourself fully to a task.\n\n1:19:37.460 --> 1:19:40.800\n That is, in another sense, you mentioned love\n\n1:19:40.800 --> 1:19:42.380\n being important, but in another sense,\n\n1:19:42.380 --> 1:19:46.660\n this kind of obsession, this pure exhibition of passion\n\n1:19:46.660 --> 1:19:50.380\n and hard work is truly what it means to be human.\n\n1:19:50.380 --> 1:19:53.140\n What lessons should we take that's deeper?\n\n1:19:53.140 --> 1:19:54.820\n Because you've accomplished incredible things.\n\n1:19:54.820 --> 1:19:57.300\n You say it chasing numbers,\n\n1:19:57.300 --> 1:20:00.980\n but really there's some incredible work there.\n\n1:20:00.980 --> 1:20:04.980\n So how do you think about that when you look back\n\n1:20:04.980 --> 1:20:09.980\n in your 20s, your 30s, what would you do differently?\n\n1:20:10.020 --> 1:20:14.860\n Would you really take back some of the incredible hard work?\n\n1:20:14.860 --> 1:20:19.860\n I would, but it's in percentages, right?\n\n1:20:19.980 --> 1:20:22.380\n We're both computer scientists.\n\n1:20:22.380 --> 1:20:25.620\n So I think when one balances one's life,\n\n1:20:25.620 --> 1:20:30.260\n when one is younger, you might give a smaller percentage\n\n1:20:30.260 --> 1:20:33.720\n to family, but you would still give them high priority.\n\n1:20:33.720 --> 1:20:36.340\n And when you get older, you would give a larger percentage\n\n1:20:36.340 --> 1:20:38.500\n to them and still the high priority.\n\n1:20:38.500 --> 1:20:42.460\n And when you're near retirement, you give most of it to them\n\n1:20:42.460 --> 1:20:43.820\n and the highest priority.\n\n1:20:43.820 --> 1:20:48.820\n So I think the key point is not that we would work 20 hours\n\n1:20:49.140 --> 1:20:52.700\n less for the whole life and just spend it aimlessly\n\n1:20:52.700 --> 1:20:56.740\n with the family, but that's when the family has a need,\n\n1:20:56.740 --> 1:21:00.260\n when your wife is having a baby,\n\n1:21:00.260 --> 1:21:05.180\n when your daughter has a birthday or when they're depressed\n\n1:21:05.180 --> 1:21:07.540\n or when they're celebrating something\n\n1:21:07.540 --> 1:21:11.400\n or when they have a get together or when we have family time\n\n1:21:11.400 --> 1:21:14.860\n that it's important for us to put down our phone and PC\n\n1:21:14.860 --> 1:21:18.340\n and be a hundred percent with them.\n\n1:21:18.340 --> 1:21:23.340\n And that priority on the things that really matter\n\n1:21:23.740 --> 1:21:28.060\n isn't going to be so taxing that it would eliminate\n\n1:21:29.140 --> 1:21:32.020\n or even dramatically reduce our accomplishments.\n\n1:21:32.020 --> 1:21:35.180\n It might have some impact, but it might also have\n\n1:21:35.180 --> 1:21:37.940\n other impact because if you have a happier family,\n\n1:21:37.940 --> 1:21:39.380\n maybe you fight less.\n\n1:21:39.380 --> 1:21:43.100\n If you fight less, you don't spend time taking care\n\n1:21:43.100 --> 1:21:45.620\n of all the aftermath of a fight.\n\n1:21:45.620 --> 1:21:48.220\n So it's unclear that it would take more time.\n\n1:21:48.220 --> 1:21:53.220\n And if it did, I'd be willing to take that reduction.\n\n1:21:53.260 --> 1:21:56.340\n And it's not a dramatic number, but it's a number\n\n1:21:56.340 --> 1:22:00.140\n that I think would give me a greater degree of happiness\n\n1:22:00.140 --> 1:22:03.260\n and knowing that I've done the right thing\n\n1:22:03.260 --> 1:22:08.260\n and still have plenty of hours to get the success\n\n1:22:08.260 --> 1:22:09.900\n that I want to get.\n\n1:22:09.900 --> 1:22:14.460\n So given the many successful companies that you've launched\n\n1:22:14.460 --> 1:22:17.340\n and much success throughout your career,\n\n1:22:17.340 --> 1:22:22.340\n what advice would you give to young people today looking,\n\n1:22:25.440 --> 1:22:26.780\n or it doesn't have to be young,\n\n1:22:26.780 --> 1:22:28.500\n but people today looking to launch\n\n1:22:28.500 --> 1:22:32.360\n and to create the next $1 billion tech startup\n\n1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:34.280\n or even AI based startup?\n\n1:22:34.280 --> 1:22:39.280\n I would suggest that people understand\n\n1:22:39.800 --> 1:22:42.720\n technology waves move quickly.\n\n1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:45.920\n What worked two years ago may not work today.\n\n1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:49.700\n And that is very much case in point for AI.\n\n1:22:49.700 --> 1:22:53.200\n I think two years ago, or maybe three years ago,\n\n1:22:53.200 --> 1:22:55.320\n you certainly could say I have a couple\n\n1:22:55.320 --> 1:22:58.880\n of super smart PhDs and we're not sure\n\n1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:01.920\n what we're gonna do, but here's how we're gonna start\n\n1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:05.200\n and get funding for a very high valuation.\n\n1:23:05.200 --> 1:23:08.480\n Those days are over because AI is going\n\n1:23:08.480 --> 1:23:11.520\n from rocket science towards mainstream,\n\n1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:14.400\n not yet commodity, but more mainstream.\n\n1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:19.400\n So first the creation of any company\n\n1:23:19.400 --> 1:23:22.720\n to a venture capitalists has to be creation\n\n1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:26.200\n of business value and monetary value.\n\n1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:29.800\n And when you have a very scarce commodity,\n\n1:23:29.800 --> 1:23:34.800\n VCs may be willing to accept greater uncertainty.\n\n1:23:35.040 --> 1:23:38.560\n But now the number of people who have the equivalent\n\n1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:42.840\n of PhD three years ago, because that can be learned\n\n1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:46.080\n more quickly, platforms are emerging,\n\n1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:49.580\n the cost to become a AI engineer is much lower\n\n1:23:49.580 --> 1:23:51.700\n and there are many more AI engineers.\n\n1:23:51.700 --> 1:23:53.960\n So the market is different.\n\n1:23:53.960 --> 1:23:57.440\n So I would suggest someone who wants to build an AI company\n\n1:23:57.440 --> 1:24:01.480\n be thinking about the normal business questions.\n\n1:24:01.480 --> 1:24:06.120\n What customer cases are you trying to address?\n\n1:24:06.120 --> 1:24:08.600\n What kind of pain are you trying to address?\n\n1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:10.680\n How does that translate to value?\n\n1:24:10.680 --> 1:24:14.680\n How will you extract value and get paid\n\n1:24:14.680 --> 1:24:18.120\n through what channel and how much business value\n\n1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:19.920\n will get created?\n\n1:24:19.920 --> 1:24:24.520\n That today needs to be thought about much earlier upfront\n\n1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:26.720\n than it did three years ago.\n\n1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:30.500\n The scarcity question of AI talent has changed.\n\n1:24:30.500 --> 1:24:32.800\n The number of AI talent has changed.\n\n1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:37.640\n So now you need not just AI, but also understanding\n\n1:24:37.640 --> 1:24:41.000\n of business customer and the marketplace.\n\n1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:46.840\n So I also think you should have a more reasonable\n\n1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:52.360\n valuation expectation and growth expectation.\n\n1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:54.080\n There's gonna be more competition.\n\n1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:57.840\n But the good news though, is that AI technologies\n\n1:24:57.840 --> 1:25:00.740\n are now more available in open source.\n\n1:25:00.740 --> 1:25:05.740\n TensorFlow, PyTorch and such tools are much easier to use.\n\n1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:11.640\n So you should be able to experiment and get results\n\n1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:14.240\n iteratively faster than before.\n\n1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:18.540\n So take more of a business mindset to this,\n\n1:25:18.540 --> 1:25:23.540\n think less of this as a laboratory taken into a company,\n\n1:25:23.540 --> 1:25:26.140\n because we've gone beyond that stage.\n\n1:25:26.140 --> 1:25:29.740\n The only exception is if you truly have a breakthrough\n\n1:25:29.740 --> 1:25:32.340\n in some technology that really no one has,\n\n1:25:32.340 --> 1:25:34.660\n then the old way still works.\n\n1:25:34.660 --> 1:25:37.140\n But I think that's harder and harder now.\n\n1:25:37.140 --> 1:25:41.140\n So I know you believe as many do that we're far\n\n1:25:41.140 --> 1:25:44.020\n from creating an artificial general intelligence system.\n\n1:25:45.420 --> 1:25:50.420\n But say once we do, and you get to ask her one question,\n\n1:25:50.420 --> 1:25:53.020\n what would that question be?\n\n1:25:57.640 --> 1:26:00.260\n What is it that differentiates you and me?\n\n1:26:02.180 --> 1:26:04.260\n Beautifully put, Kaifu, thank you so much\n\n1:26:04.260 --> 1:26:05.760\n for your time today.\n\n1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:25.760\n Thank you.\n\n"
