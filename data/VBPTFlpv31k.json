largest cryptocurrency exchange platform\n\n00:07.800 --> 00:11.360\n with 98 million users in 100 countries,\n\n00:11.360 --> 00:13.880\n listing Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano,\n\n00:13.880 --> 00:17.320\n and over 100 popular cryptocurrencies.\n\n00:17.320 --> 00:19.280\n I recorded this conversation with Brian\n\n00:19.280 --> 00:21.880\n before this week's SEC probe\n\n00:21.880 --> 00:25.440\n into whether some of the crypto listings are securities\n\n00:25.440 --> 00:27.880\n and thus need to be regulated as such.\n\n00:27.880 --> 00:31.240\n As always, with conversations that involve cryptocurrency,\n\n00:31.240 --> 00:33.000\n I try to make it timeless\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:37.200\n so that the price soaring high or crashing down low\n\n00:37.200 --> 00:40.520\n doesn't distract from the fundamental technological,\n\n00:40.520 --> 00:42.720\n economic, social, and philosophical ideas\n\n00:42.720 --> 00:47.720\n underlying this new form of money, energy, and information.\n\n00:47.760 --> 00:52.400\n Our world runs on money, the exchange and store of value,\n\n00:52.400 --> 00:55.360\n and cryptocurrency seeks to build the next chapter\n\n00:55.360 --> 00:58.680\n of how money works and what it can do.\n\n00:58.680 --> 01:01.280\n Coinbase and Brian are trying to do this\n\n01:01.280 --> 01:04.280\n by working together with regulators and governments,\n\n01:04.280 --> 01:06.760\n which is a long and difficult road.\n\n01:06.760 --> 01:11.240\n Bureaucracies resist change, for better and for worse.\n\n01:11.240 --> 01:14.680\n The latest SEC probe is a good representation of this.\n\n01:14.680 --> 01:17.480\n It is a serious attempt to limit fraud,\n\n01:17.480 --> 01:20.960\n but one that also runs the risk of limiting innovation\n\n01:20.960 --> 01:24.440\n and limiting financial freedom of individuals.\n\n01:24.440 --> 01:26.040\n This is a complicated mess,\n\n01:26.040 --> 01:27.480\n and I applaud everyone involved\n\n01:27.480 --> 01:29.400\n for trying to work through it.\n\n01:29.400 --> 01:33.120\n I hope in the end, the interest of the individual wins.\n\n01:33.120 --> 01:35.880\n Decentralization, after all, is a hedge\n\n01:35.880 --> 01:39.320\n against the corrupting nature of centralized power.\n\n01:39.320 --> 01:41.320\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:41.320 --> 01:43.520\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:43.520 --> 01:44.760\n in the description.\n\n01:44.760 --> 01:48.280\n And now, dear friends, here's Brian Armstrong.\n\n01:49.200 --> 01:51.680\n Let's start with the fact that you're a programmer.\n\n01:51.680 --> 01:53.960\n What was the first program you've ever written?\n\n01:53.960 --> 01:55.920\n Or the first one that you remember?\n\n01:55.920 --> 01:57.720\n The first memory I have of programming\n\n01:57.720 --> 01:59.320\n was probably in middle school.\n\n01:59.320 --> 02:01.800\n And I remember it was recess,\n\n02:01.800 --> 02:04.800\n and they had this time period where you could read books,\n\n02:04.800 --> 02:07.240\n and the other kids were reading comic books and stuff.\n\n02:07.240 --> 02:10.240\n And for some reason, I had gotten into this idea\n\n02:10.240 --> 02:11.560\n that I wanted to get into computers,\n\n02:11.560 --> 02:13.920\n and I was playing with computers at home.\n\n02:13.920 --> 02:15.880\n And so I got this book, I think from the library,\n\n02:15.880 --> 02:19.520\n it was called How to Learn Java in 30 Days.\n\n02:19.520 --> 02:24.000\n So I was reading this book at the recess,\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:25.680\n and I didn't understand anything.\n\n02:25.680 --> 02:26.960\n And I remember I went home,\n\n02:26.960 --> 02:29.600\n and I tried to get this thing working.\n\n02:29.600 --> 02:31.840\n And if you've ever written a Java program,\n\n02:31.840 --> 02:35.040\n the first lines are public static void main string args\n\n02:35.040 --> 02:35.880\n or whatever.\n\n02:35.880 --> 02:39.400\n And it's so foreign, and it's so difficult to get started.\n\n02:39.400 --> 02:40.520\n And so I was kind of frustrated.\n\n02:40.520 --> 02:41.840\n I was like, I don't understand anything\n\n02:41.840 --> 02:43.280\n that's happening in this book.\n\n02:43.280 --> 02:45.960\n So the first thing I wrote was probably just\n\n02:45.960 --> 02:48.240\n a Hello World app in Java.\n\n02:48.240 --> 02:51.640\n But I felt like I was so confused\n\n02:51.640 --> 02:52.840\n about what was actually happening\n\n02:52.840 --> 02:55.800\n that I later learned a bit of PHP.\n\n02:55.800 --> 02:57.680\n And PHP was like more fun for me\n\n02:57.680 --> 03:00.400\n because it was like, oh, just print out what you want.\n\n03:00.400 --> 03:02.080\n It didn't have all this complexity around it.\n\n03:02.080 --> 03:04.320\n So then I got more into PHP,\n\n03:04.320 --> 03:06.880\n I started building like some simple websites,\n\n03:06.880 --> 03:09.240\n I think learned some HTML.\n\n03:09.240 --> 03:12.120\n So I think that was my introduction to programming,\n\n03:12.120 --> 03:13.320\n at least the very beginning part.\n\n03:13.320 --> 03:18.320\n Yeah, you know, Java has a lot of,\n\n03:18.440 --> 03:20.640\n out of all the Hello Worlds it could possibly write,\n\n03:20.640 --> 03:23.160\n Java is the one where I think it's the longest.\n\n03:23.160 --> 03:24.160\n Yeah.\n\n03:24.160 --> 03:25.080\n Which is quite interesting\n\n03:25.080 --> 03:27.080\n because Java is often at least for a long time\n\n03:27.080 --> 03:29.160\n was used as the primary programming language\n\n03:29.160 --> 03:30.800\n to teach people how to program,\n\n03:30.800 --> 03:32.680\n or at least about object oriented programming.\n\n03:32.680 --> 03:35.280\n I think most universities have now switched\n\n03:35.280 --> 03:37.360\n and high school switched to Python.\n\n03:37.360 --> 03:38.800\n I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\n03:38.800 --> 03:39.640\n Probably better.\n\n03:39.640 --> 03:40.480\n It's easier to learn.\n\n03:40.480 --> 03:42.200\n It lowers the, it makes it less scary.\n\n03:42.200 --> 03:43.520\n It was like less of a hurdle.\n\n03:43.520 --> 03:45.320\n And certainly none of them use PHP.\n\n03:45.320 --> 03:48.400\n I love PHP and I feel like it's a dirty secret.\n\n03:48.400 --> 03:51.000\n I have to keep private to myself.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:52.600\n Like it's somebody I'm seeing on the side\n\n03:52.600 --> 03:53.440\n or something like that,\n\n03:53.440 --> 03:56.320\n because it's just not a respected programming language\n\n03:56.320 --> 03:57.880\n because I think there's so many ways\n\n03:57.880 --> 04:00.720\n you can write poor code with PHP,\n\n04:00.720 --> 04:02.080\n which is why it's not respected.\n\n04:02.080 --> 04:03.960\n Yeah, it's a scripting language more so,\n\n04:03.960 --> 04:06.280\n although of course Facebook built like a huge stack\n\n04:06.280 --> 04:07.640\n on top of an invaluable company,\n\n04:07.640 --> 04:10.200\n but I still love Ruby to this day.\n\n04:10.200 --> 04:12.320\n Ruby is probably my favorite language.\n\n04:12.320 --> 04:13.160\n Python's great too,\n\n04:13.160 --> 04:16.280\n but I just love the idea behind Ruby that it's like,\n\n04:16.280 --> 04:18.160\n let's make it easier for the human,\n\n04:18.160 --> 04:19.480\n harder for the computer,\n\n04:19.480 --> 04:22.560\n and make it a joy to be expressive and all these things.\n\n04:22.560 --> 04:24.920\n So I was never the best computer scientist,\n\n04:24.920 --> 04:26.200\n but I was a good hacker.\n\n04:26.200 --> 04:28.200\n I could rapidly prototype products\n\n04:28.200 --> 04:30.480\n and using languages like Ruby.\n\n04:30.480 --> 04:33.800\n Do a lot of computer science programs still use like Lisp\n\n04:33.800 --> 04:35.240\n and Scheme and things like that?\n\n04:35.240 --> 04:39.080\n No, they do for, that's like, that's if you're hardcore.\n\n04:39.080 --> 04:40.520\n If you're legit, you're gonna do\n\n04:40.520 --> 04:42.280\n some of the functional languages.\n\n04:42.280 --> 04:44.920\n I think there's a few others that popped up,\n\n04:44.920 --> 04:48.600\n but Lisp is a distant memory for a lot of people.\n\n04:48.600 --> 04:49.960\n That's like somebody has to like,\n\n04:49.960 --> 04:53.600\n you go to library, you dust off the book,\n\n04:53.600 --> 04:55.760\n but Scheme a little bit.\n\n04:55.760 --> 04:57.240\n I think if you're starting,\n\n04:57.240 --> 04:59.440\n I mean, there's courses about languages themselves,\n\n04:59.440 --> 05:01.560\n like programming languages.\n\n05:01.560 --> 05:03.160\n Lisp might be one of those,\n\n05:03.160 --> 05:05.480\n you know how there's languages that nobody uses anymore,\n\n05:05.480 --> 05:06.800\n like ancient languages?\n\n05:06.800 --> 05:09.160\n You might have to go to school in that same way\n\n05:09.160 --> 05:10.640\n for programming languages.\n\n05:10.640 --> 05:12.840\n Back in the day, we used to use parentheses.\n\n05:12.840 --> 05:15.840\n I of course still use Emacs as the editor\n\n05:15.840 --> 05:17.440\n for most things that I do.\n\n05:17.440 --> 05:22.040\n And Emacs is, a lot of the customization you can do\n\n05:22.040 --> 05:24.960\n is in Lisp and that's the language probably\n\n05:24.960 --> 05:29.960\n when I first really fell in love with programming is Lisp.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:34.440\n Because for a long time throughout the earlier history\n\n05:34.440 --> 05:35.520\n of artificial intelligence,\n\n05:35.520 --> 05:36.800\n Lisp was the primary language,\n\n05:36.800 --> 05:41.520\n but it still had a life in the 90s and the aughts\n\n05:41.520 --> 05:43.240\n where some people would use it.\n\n05:43.240 --> 05:46.480\n It's such a beautiful functional language,\n\n05:46.480 --> 05:48.280\n but it just somehow didn't pick up.\n\n05:51.680 --> 05:53.480\n That said, I should say sort of push back,\n\n05:53.480 --> 05:55.840\n PHP, I feel like it's still true\n\n05:55.840 --> 05:58.880\n that most of the web runs on PHP.\n\n05:58.880 --> 06:02.200\n Most of the backend is still PHP.\n\n06:02.200 --> 06:03.760\n So if you look at, you know,\n\n06:03.760 --> 06:05.720\n it's like the stuff that people don't talk about.\n\n06:05.720 --> 06:08.520\n It's like what runs most systems in the world?\n\n06:08.520 --> 06:11.080\n What runs the most backend?\n\n06:11.080 --> 06:12.960\n What runs most front end?\n\n06:12.960 --> 06:15.840\n JavaScript, you know, HTML.\n\n06:15.840 --> 06:18.640\n The Stack Exchange surveys show JavaScript\n\n06:18.640 --> 06:20.360\n is the most popular language in the world, I think, right?\n\n06:20.360 --> 06:23.620\n Oh yeah, in terms of programmers and numbers of, I wonder.\n\n06:25.480 --> 06:28.920\n By survey of number of programmers on Stack Overflow.\n\n06:28.920 --> 06:31.400\n Oh yeah, but that's also the cutting edge, right?\n\n06:31.400 --> 06:33.880\n Those are the people that are just like excitedly\n\n06:33.880 --> 06:34.840\n writing code.\n\n06:34.840 --> 06:37.480\n I wonder if there's people that are just like\n\n06:37.480 --> 06:40.280\n maintaining gigantic code bases.\n\n06:40.280 --> 06:43.520\n Yeah, I feel like the amount of Java out there\n\n06:43.520 --> 06:46.680\n just running industrial systems has gotta be enormous.\n\n06:46.680 --> 06:49.280\n And then of course in the banking industry, finance,\n\n06:49.280 --> 06:52.760\n it's like even older stuff, Cobalt and whatnot, but.\n\n06:52.760 --> 06:57.400\n I've been actually looking for somebody to interview\n\n06:57.400 --> 07:00.840\n who represents Cobalt and Fortran.\n\n07:00.840 --> 07:05.320\n Like who's the figure still there that holds the flag?\n\n07:05.320 --> 07:07.640\n I did, you know, with Java, founder of Java,\n\n07:07.640 --> 07:11.360\n creator of Java, creator of Python, creator of C++,\n\n07:11.360 --> 07:14.360\n but nobody wants to hold the flag for Cobalt and Fortran,\n\n07:14.360 --> 07:17.920\n even though some of the most important systems in the world\n\n07:17.920 --> 07:20.120\n still run on those.\n\n07:20.120 --> 07:23.480\n Like power systems and infrastructure systems,\n\n07:23.480 --> 07:27.080\n which is fascinating, and ATMs and stuff like that.\n\n07:27.080 --> 07:30.440\n Like a lot of stuff that we rely on,\n\n07:30.440 --> 07:32.400\n it just works, and the reason we don't change it\n\n07:32.400 --> 07:33.920\n is because it works well.\n\n07:33.920 --> 07:36.920\n It was written in languages that people don't use anymore.\n\n07:36.920 --> 07:39.600\n Yeah, that'd be a cool series of interviews.\n\n07:39.600 --> 07:42.440\n Get the stuff that's like tech that was invented\n\n07:42.440 --> 07:45.320\n 40, 50 years ago, but still is being used widely.\n\n07:45.320 --> 07:47.120\n I mean Emacs is an example of that.\n\n07:47.120 --> 07:49.160\n Let me ask the big question of\n\n07:50.800 --> 07:54.000\n what are cryptocurrency exchanges and what's Coinbase?\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:55.040\n How does it work?\n\n07:55.040 --> 07:57.440\n Before, I'll ask even bigger questions,\n\n07:57.440 --> 08:00.800\n but it's just a nice kind of palate cleansing question\n\n08:00.800 --> 08:02.040\n of what is Coinbase?\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:07.600\n Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange brokerage custodian.\n\n08:07.600 --> 08:11.080\n Basically, we're the primary financial account for people\n\n08:11.080 --> 08:13.720\n in the crypto economy, how they buy crypto,\n\n08:13.720 --> 08:15.520\n how they store it, how they use it increasingly\n\n08:15.520 --> 08:16.360\n in different ways.\n\n08:16.360 --> 08:17.320\n We can talk about that.\n\n08:18.520 --> 08:20.840\n So yeah, we want to be the way that a billion people\n\n08:20.840 --> 08:23.840\n hopefully access the open financial system globally.\n\n08:23.840 --> 08:25.000\n How does it work?\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.720\n What's cryptocurrency?\n\n08:29.640 --> 08:33.440\n There's Bitcoin, there's Ethereum.\n\n08:34.800 --> 08:37.360\n What does it mean to be an exchange?\n\n08:37.360 --> 08:39.000\n What does it mean to store?\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:40.560\n What does it mean to transact?\n\n08:40.560 --> 08:43.640\n How does it, what does Coinbase actually do?\n\n08:43.640 --> 08:46.680\n Okay, so basically in any given market,\n\n08:46.680 --> 08:47.880\n there's some people who want to buy,\n\n08:47.880 --> 08:49.360\n some people who want to sell,\n\n08:49.360 --> 08:53.280\n and you keep an order book of all those prices.\n\n08:53.280 --> 08:56.920\n And then if someone's willing to buy\n\n08:56.920 --> 08:59.800\n for more than the lowest price someone's willing to sell,\n\n08:59.800 --> 09:02.120\n then you get a trade to execute.\n\n09:02.120 --> 09:04.440\n That's kind of how an exchange works underneath.\n\n09:04.440 --> 09:06.800\n And a brokerage is kind of simpler than that even.\n\n09:06.800 --> 09:08.000\n You don't have to know,\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:09.440\n look at the whole order book and everything,\n\n09:09.440 --> 09:10.600\n but you just go in there and you say,\n\n09:10.600 --> 09:12.360\n I want to buy a hundred dollars of Bitcoin\n\n09:12.360 --> 09:14.000\n or whatever cryptocurrency.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.200\n You get a quote, and if you like it, you can hit accept.\n\n09:16.200 --> 09:19.480\n And the core things that we do to make all that\n\n09:19.480 --> 09:21.480\n kind of just work, make it seamless,\n\n09:21.480 --> 09:23.040\n it sounds simple on the surface,\n\n09:23.040 --> 09:26.160\n is we have to do payment integrations\n\n09:26.160 --> 09:27.520\n in a variety of places around the world\n\n09:27.520 --> 09:29.560\n to make it easy for people to get fiat currency\n\n09:29.560 --> 09:31.720\n into this ecosystem.\n\n09:31.720 --> 09:33.720\n We have to do work on cybersecurity a lot.\n\n09:33.720 --> 09:35.160\n There's lots of hackers out there\n\n09:35.160 --> 09:37.080\n trying to break into our systems and steal crypto\n\n09:37.080 --> 09:39.880\n or to put stolen credit cards and bank accounts\n\n09:39.880 --> 09:41.880\n and things like that into these systems.\n\n09:42.960 --> 09:45.480\n We have to integrate with the blockchains themselves,\n\n09:45.480 --> 09:48.400\n which are periodically getting updated\n\n09:48.400 --> 09:51.320\n and having various airdrops and all kinds of things.\n\n09:51.320 --> 09:53.520\n So we're integrated with lots of different blockchains.\n\n09:53.520 --> 09:54.560\n And then we have to store the crypto\n\n09:54.560 --> 09:57.040\n that people buy securely as well.\n\n09:57.040 --> 09:59.400\n So crypto is kind of like storing,\n\n09:59.400 --> 10:00.920\n you store the private keys essentially.\n\n10:00.920 --> 10:03.040\n And we've invented a lot of cool technology\n\n10:03.040 --> 10:04.800\n about how to do that securely\n\n10:04.800 --> 10:06.960\n that helps me sleep at night\n\n10:06.960 --> 10:09.480\n as one of the largest crypto custodians out there.\n\n10:10.440 --> 10:12.400\n So those are some of the pieces that had to come together\n\n10:12.400 --> 10:16.360\n to get that early simple buy sell experience to work.\n\n10:16.360 --> 10:18.640\n And yeah, I mean, Coinbase actually has\n\n10:18.640 --> 10:20.000\n a lot of different products now.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.880\n So we have like an institutional product.\n\n10:21.880 --> 10:23.280\n We have Coinbase Commerce,\n\n10:23.280 --> 10:26.120\n which is like merchant payments, like Stripe for crypto.\n\n10:26.120 --> 10:27.960\n We've got a self custodial wallet,\n\n10:27.960 --> 10:28.800\n which we can talk about.\n\n10:28.800 --> 10:30.320\n There's all kinds of cool applications\n\n10:30.320 --> 10:31.560\n people are building with web3\n\n10:31.560 --> 10:32.680\n and they can access it through that.\n\n10:32.680 --> 10:35.000\n We just launched an NFT product.\n\n10:36.280 --> 10:37.640\n I can go on down the list.\n\n10:37.640 --> 10:39.680\n So we're sort of like a portfolio of crypto products now.\n\n10:39.680 --> 10:42.000\n We're big enough where we can do multiple things.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:43.920\n But yeah, the core thing we got started with\n\n10:43.920 --> 10:45.520\n and still the majority of our revenue today\n\n10:45.520 --> 10:48.680\n is people just wanna come in and buy and sell some crypto.\n\n10:48.680 --> 10:49.960\n And we help them do that and make it simple\n\n10:49.960 --> 10:51.000\n and easy to use.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.880\n And I'll ask you about wallet, NFT is about,\n\n10:53.880 --> 10:54.720\n what is it called?\n\n10:54.720 --> 10:55.680\n The Stripe type?\n\n10:55.680 --> 10:56.720\n Coinbase Commerce.\n\n10:56.720 --> 10:58.040\n Coinbase Commerce.\n\n10:58.040 --> 10:59.160\n I'll ask you about all that.\n\n10:59.160 --> 11:01.320\n But order books in exchange,\n\n11:01.320 --> 11:04.840\n what's the difference between that and stocks, for example,\n\n11:04.840 --> 11:06.520\n which there's also order books.\n\n11:06.520 --> 11:08.560\n Yes, I mean, stocks trade through order books too.\n\n11:08.560 --> 11:09.600\n So do commodities.\n\n11:09.600 --> 11:12.000\n There's all similar type of situation.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:15.640\n So when I wanna buy one Bitcoin and I see Coinbase,\n\n11:15.640 --> 11:20.520\n say the price of that Bitcoin is say $40,000\n\n11:20.520 --> 11:23.560\n and I press buy, what happens?\n\n11:25.400 --> 11:26.240\n Yeah, okay.\n\n11:26.240 --> 11:27.160\n So you've gotten a lot,\n\n11:29.520 --> 11:30.960\n when you press the button on your keyboard,\n\n11:30.960 --> 11:32.880\n like an electrical signal goes up the wire\n\n11:32.880 --> 11:33.720\n on your keyboard.\n\n11:33.720 --> 11:35.040\n No, we won't cut out the level.\n\n11:35.040 --> 11:36.720\n That's also important, the timing, right?\n\n11:36.720 --> 11:38.760\n Cause it's not price fixed.\n\n11:38.760 --> 11:39.600\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n11:39.600 --> 11:40.880\n It's giving you a quote, right?\n\n11:42.880 --> 11:44.520\n There's a whole concept of like slippage.\n\n11:44.520 --> 11:47.320\n And like by the time the quote is executed,\n\n11:48.240 --> 11:50.760\n if the price has moved too much, like we may reject it.\n\n11:50.760 --> 11:52.920\n And there's various things like that.\n\n11:52.920 --> 11:55.040\n But how do, I mean, what's the simple version I can give you?\n\n11:55.040 --> 11:59.080\n So we'll basically check the order book, give you a quote.\n\n11:59.080 --> 12:00.560\n It's good for some period of time\n\n12:00.560 --> 12:02.480\n or for some amount of slippage.\n\n12:02.480 --> 12:06.200\n And then what's happening is we're initiating a debit\n\n12:06.200 --> 12:08.120\n to your payment method, whether that's a credit card\n\n12:08.120 --> 12:11.240\n or a bank account, or you're storing dollars or euros\n\n12:11.240 --> 12:12.440\n or something on our platform,\n\n12:12.440 --> 12:13.800\n there's various payment methods.\n\n12:13.800 --> 12:15.560\n So we're basically debiting that.\n\n12:15.560 --> 12:17.520\n And then we're crediting you the crypto\n\n12:17.520 --> 12:19.640\n and we're taking a fee for it too.\n\n12:19.640 --> 12:24.160\n So that's fundamentally what's happening underneath.\n\n12:24.160 --> 12:26.120\n And then there's just some interesting slippage.\n\n12:26.120 --> 12:30.640\n How do you calculate how much slippage is allowed?\n\n12:30.640 --> 12:33.280\n Like how do you know these things?\n\n12:33.280 --> 12:35.200\n Cause order books are fascinating.\n\n12:36.680 --> 12:39.360\n The dynamics of that is pretty interesting.\n\n12:39.360 --> 12:40.720\n The little I know about it.\n\n12:40.720 --> 12:43.720\n Yeah, so there's a lot of people like traders\n\n12:43.720 --> 12:46.080\n who get super into this and like high frequency traders\n\n12:46.080 --> 12:48.320\n and arbitrage and all kinds of interesting topics.\n\n12:48.320 --> 12:49.880\n Flash Boys was like an interesting book\n\n12:49.880 --> 12:50.840\n on this whole thing.\n\n12:50.840 --> 12:53.840\n You want like access to information the fastest,\n\n12:53.840 --> 12:56.800\n sometimes even putting your thing in the data center\n\n12:56.800 --> 12:58.160\n right next to the thing.\n\n12:58.160 --> 12:59.440\n We don't allow that colo stuff\n\n12:59.440 --> 13:01.480\n cause we want it to be more democratized.\n\n13:03.240 --> 13:05.240\n But basically you give a,\n\n13:05.240 --> 13:07.080\n let's say we wanted to just keep it math simple.\n\n13:07.080 --> 13:08.640\n We want to charge a 1% fee.\n\n13:08.640 --> 13:11.120\n So if you're buying $100 of Bitcoin\n\n13:11.120 --> 13:13.400\n and we'll charge you $101,\n\n13:13.400 --> 13:14.840\n we've presented you the amount of Bitcoin\n\n13:14.840 --> 13:16.280\n you're going to get for the $100.\n\n13:16.280 --> 13:18.720\n Now let's say 10 seconds later you hit accept.\n\n13:18.720 --> 13:21.000\n We go to fill the order.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.560\n So it's going to be some error bound\n\n13:23.560 --> 13:25.400\n around that 1% fee, right?\n\n13:25.400 --> 13:27.520\n And if we think we're actually losing money on the trade,\n\n13:27.520 --> 13:29.520\n I think we'll often reject it.\n\n13:29.520 --> 13:31.960\n So some part of the fee,\n\n13:31.960 --> 13:35.000\n the slippage is incorporated into that,\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.240\n averaged over a large number of people.\n\n13:38.240 --> 13:39.680\n Just, it's fascinating.\n\n13:39.680 --> 13:41.560\n Cause like even just like that little detail\n\n13:41.560 --> 13:44.240\n probably requires a lot of experimentation.\n\n13:44.240 --> 13:45.080\n Yeah.\n\n13:45.080 --> 13:46.960\n And it's kind of like a giant bug bounty out there\n\n13:46.960 --> 13:48.480\n because if you get it wrong,\n\n13:48.480 --> 13:50.040\n there's people who are going to arbitrage that.\n\n13:50.040 --> 13:53.600\n And we've had people sort of pen test our systems\n\n13:53.600 --> 13:55.840\n in a really creative ways where like,\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:01.280\n they'll just fire like programmatically with APIs,\n\n14:01.280 --> 14:03.560\n they'll fire off like a million different quotes\n\n14:03.560 --> 14:05.320\n and look for one of them that's out of bounds\n\n14:05.320 --> 14:07.200\n and then actually take that money right there.\n\n14:07.200 --> 14:10.360\n And we get people doing all kinds of crazy stuff.\n\n14:10.360 --> 14:12.320\n So how do you protect against that?\n\n14:12.320 --> 14:13.400\n How do you protect?\n\n14:13.400 --> 14:15.880\n So we'll talk about cybersecurity in interesting ways,\n\n14:15.880 --> 14:18.240\n but there's a lot of clever people\n\n14:18.240 --> 14:20.960\n trying to do clever things to earn,\n\n14:20.960 --> 14:22.640\n not even just to break into the system,\n\n14:22.640 --> 14:26.280\n but to earn an edge of some kind in the system.\n\n14:26.280 --> 14:28.840\n How do you stay one step ahead?\n\n14:28.840 --> 14:29.680\n There's no silver bullet,\n\n14:29.680 --> 14:30.840\n it's a bunch of lead bullets, right?\n\n14:30.840 --> 14:34.680\n So it's like, you know, one thing we do is\n\n14:34.680 --> 14:36.200\n we just have good test suites, right?\n\n14:36.200 --> 14:38.440\n So you're testing every piece of code that goes out,\n\n14:38.440 --> 14:40.180\n that's like just common good best practice,\n\n14:40.180 --> 14:42.920\n but it's particularly important in financial services.\n\n14:43.800 --> 14:45.960\n Another thing we do is we hire third party firms\n\n14:45.960 --> 14:48.040\n to try to audit this stuff and break in.\n\n14:48.040 --> 14:51.280\n Another one we do is we have a bug bounty program.\n\n14:51.280 --> 14:55.480\n So we basically pay white hat hackers to find this stuff\n\n14:55.480 --> 14:56.800\n before the black hats do.\n\n14:56.800 --> 14:59.800\n And we've paid out lots of good bug bounties.\n\n14:59.800 --> 15:02.780\n So, you know, try all the above.\n\n15:02.780 --> 15:03.840\n And occasionally you don't get it right\n\n15:03.840 --> 15:05.440\n and you lose some money and then you fix it\n\n15:05.440 --> 15:07.400\n and you keep going, so yeah.\n\n15:07.400 --> 15:10.360\n Let's talk about cybersecurity a little bit more.\n\n15:10.360 --> 15:13.200\n You mentioned using stolen bank accounts.\n\n15:13.200 --> 15:15.200\n So that's another one, that's another interesting one.\n\n15:15.200 --> 15:17.480\n How do you protect against that?\n\n15:17.480 --> 15:20.720\n Okay, so fraud prevention, yeah, is a big topic.\n\n15:20.720 --> 15:23.120\n So one of the, there's a lot of things people do,\n\n15:23.120 --> 15:25.200\n but one of the things they do\n\n15:25.200 --> 15:28.200\n is that you use machine learning, right?\n\n15:28.200 --> 15:29.800\n So you look at hundreds.\n\n15:29.800 --> 15:30.920\n To protect or to attack?\n\n15:30.920 --> 15:32.400\n To protect against it.\n\n15:32.400 --> 15:35.620\n So what you want to do is kind of build up\n\n15:35.620 --> 15:39.000\n a labeled data set of all the different people\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:42.720\n who have turned out to be fraudulent and good actors,\n\n15:42.720 --> 15:44.240\n and hopefully collect as much data as you can.\n\n15:44.240 --> 15:45.800\n And then, you know, you might feed hundreds\n\n15:45.800 --> 15:47.720\n or thousands of these factors\n\n15:47.720 --> 15:49.480\n into your machine learning model\n\n15:49.480 --> 15:51.600\n and it'll come back with a risk score.\n\n15:51.600 --> 15:54.720\n So, you know, an example of like the kinds of factors\n\n15:54.720 --> 15:56.460\n people create or put in there, you know,\n\n15:56.460 --> 15:57.880\n obviously I don't want to disclose too many of them\n\n15:57.880 --> 15:59.740\n because it's a cat and mouse game,\n\n15:59.740 --> 16:01.360\n but just kind of, I don't know,\n\n16:01.360 --> 16:03.300\n relatively well known stuff might be.\n\n16:03.300 --> 16:06.900\n You know, you have device fingerprints, right?\n\n16:06.900 --> 16:08.860\n So like, what kind of device are you on\n\n16:08.860 --> 16:10.380\n and what fonts do you have installed?\n\n16:10.380 --> 16:12.300\n A lot of people who are farming lots of these accounts,\n\n16:12.300 --> 16:15.220\n they're using emulators and like virtual machines and stuff.\n\n16:15.220 --> 16:16.460\n They're not like, you know,\n\n16:16.460 --> 16:18.160\n an average person on that device.\n\n16:19.160 --> 16:21.160\n And then you'll see sometimes like,\n\n16:21.160 --> 16:23.260\n one of my favorite metrics we track for this\n\n16:23.260 --> 16:26.120\n was called like improbable travel velocity.\n\n16:26.120 --> 16:28.480\n So we would, we're tracking people's IPS, right?\n\n16:28.480 --> 16:33.340\n And you might see someone who was one day in Austin, Texas\n\n16:33.340 --> 16:36.140\n and then like an hour later they were in London or something.\n\n16:36.140 --> 16:37.560\n It's like, well, that's very improbable.\n\n16:37.560 --> 16:39.500\n I mean, sometimes people are using VPNs.\n\n16:39.500 --> 16:40.500\n So you gotta be careful with that\n\n16:40.500 --> 16:42.780\n because like there's legitimate people who use VPNs too.\n\n16:42.780 --> 16:46.700\n But if it's not possible for them to have gotten on a plane\n\n16:46.700 --> 16:47.620\n and gotten there that quickly,\n\n16:47.620 --> 16:50.260\n then that's usually they're like spoofing a device or IP.\n\n16:50.260 --> 16:52.540\n Sometimes those are interesting factors.\n\n16:52.540 --> 16:56.100\n But yeah, if you feed enough of these in, you will,\n\n16:56.100 --> 16:59.460\n oh, another fun one is like, you know,\n\n16:59.460 --> 17:01.580\n real users will type their credit card\n\n17:01.580 --> 17:03.720\n like one number at a time.\n\n17:03.720 --> 17:05.280\n Scammers have a list of them\n\n17:05.280 --> 17:08.260\n and they'll just paste in a whole number.\n\n17:08.260 --> 17:10.760\n So you can look at like the number of milliseconds\n\n17:10.760 --> 17:11.900\n between keystrokes.\n\n17:11.900 --> 17:13.700\n Like there's all kinds of stuff people have come up with.\n\n17:13.700 --> 17:15.340\n And even for travel velocity,\n\n17:15.340 --> 17:17.740\n you could probably incorporate VPNs too\n\n17:17.740 --> 17:21.100\n because there's probably a travel velocity\n\n17:21.100 --> 17:24.500\n for VPN switching too that's human like.\n\n17:24.500 --> 17:27.340\n Like if you're using legitimately VPN for something else,\n\n17:27.340 --> 17:31.060\n that might be, there's like legitimate uses too.\n\n17:31.060 --> 17:32.660\n Actually, you know, I feel embarrassed\n\n17:32.660 --> 17:34.860\n that I don't know this, probably should.\n\n17:34.860 --> 17:37.640\n But the, I'm not a robot.\n\n17:37.640 --> 17:39.300\n Capture thing. Capture thing.\n\n17:39.300 --> 17:40.140\n Yeah.\n\n17:40.140 --> 17:42.580\n So that probably works in the same way.\n\n17:42.580 --> 17:46.020\n Like how do you move your mouse maybe\n\n17:46.020 --> 17:48.960\n or how the dynamics of the clicking.\n\n17:48.960 --> 17:49.800\n Totally.\n\n17:49.800 --> 17:51.660\n But how does that even work that well then?\n\n17:51.660 --> 17:52.960\n And why can't it be fake?\n\n17:52.960 --> 17:53.940\n I need to look into this.\n\n17:53.940 --> 17:56.860\n Cause it's such a trivial capture.\n\n17:56.860 --> 17:58.740\n It feels like it should be very crackable.\n\n17:58.740 --> 18:02.340\n And yet a lot of high security places use that.\n\n18:02.340 --> 18:03.180\n Yeah.\n\n18:03.180 --> 18:04.000\n It's really interesting.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:04.940\n It's another cat and mouse game.\n\n18:04.940 --> 18:05.960\n So I think they've, yeah,\n\n18:05.960 --> 18:07.460\n but it's using a lot of similar signals\n\n18:07.460 --> 18:10.220\n like mouse movements, keystrokes.\n\n18:10.220 --> 18:12.060\n And then obviously all the stuff that comes over\n\n18:12.060 --> 18:14.180\n the wire with your browser.\n\n18:14.180 --> 18:17.340\n So like what operating system, what fonts,\n\n18:17.340 --> 18:18.940\n what headers are being sent over.\n\n18:18.940 --> 18:21.940\n And there's actually, there's an old website.\n\n18:21.940 --> 18:22.780\n I can't remember what it's called.\n\n18:22.780 --> 18:24.180\n It was kind of like Panoptik Click\n\n18:24.180 --> 18:25.500\n or Panopticon or something.\n\n18:25.500 --> 18:27.560\n But it basically was like a proof of concept site\n\n18:27.560 --> 18:30.180\n that they would just show you all the data\n\n18:30.180 --> 18:33.080\n that was kind of getting sent over with your request.\n\n18:33.080 --> 18:36.140\n And like say that there's only one person in the world\n\n18:36.140 --> 18:37.420\n who has this exact set of data.\n\n18:37.420 --> 18:38.260\n It's you.\n\n18:38.260 --> 18:41.100\n And so it's almost like a workaround,\n\n18:41.100 --> 18:43.820\n a clever workaround to track somebody,\n\n18:43.820 --> 18:45.420\n make identify a unique person,\n\n18:45.420 --> 18:48.320\n even if like there wasn't a cookie involved or something.\n\n18:48.320 --> 18:50.140\n Yeah, this is a fascinating world\n\n18:50.140 --> 18:52.740\n where you can't see anybody here in the dark\n\n18:52.740 --> 18:54.060\n and yet you have a lot of signal\n\n18:54.060 --> 18:56.260\n and you have to figure out who's a real person, who's not.\n\n18:56.260 --> 18:58.380\n Who's a robot, who's not.\n\n18:58.380 --> 18:59.220\n Let me step back.\n\n18:59.220 --> 19:00.660\n We're gonna jump around all over the place.\n\n19:00.660 --> 19:01.500\n Let me step back.\n\n19:01.500 --> 19:02.320\n That's why I like your interviews.\n\n19:02.320 --> 19:04.140\n You get into like technical topics.\n\n19:05.220 --> 19:09.240\n So just let's use Bitcoin as a measure of time.\n\n19:09.240 --> 19:12.180\n You started Coinbase when Bitcoin was $10.\n\n19:14.460 --> 19:17.020\n And you just mentioned an incredible system\n\n19:17.020 --> 19:19.800\n with security, with transactions.\n\n19:19.800 --> 19:20.920\n Everything is thought through.\n\n19:20.920 --> 19:21.980\n There's a lot going on.\n\n19:21.980 --> 19:25.060\n But what was version one back in those early days,\n\n19:25.060 --> 19:26.740\n the first prototype of Coinbase?\n\n19:26.740 --> 19:28.300\n What did that look like?\n\n19:28.300 --> 19:31.060\n Like what did it take to write it,\n\n19:31.060 --> 19:35.420\n to think through it and make it work enough\n\n19:35.420 --> 19:38.580\n to at least make you believe that it's gonna work?\n\n19:38.580 --> 19:40.060\n Well, I definitely didn't know if it was gonna work.\n\n19:40.060 --> 19:41.380\n I mean, it was kind of,\n\n19:41.380 --> 19:44.100\n I felt like I was just following my gut.\n\n19:44.100 --> 19:47.020\n So, I mean, I was working at Airbnb.\n\n19:47.020 --> 19:50.060\n I was a software engineer there, project manager.\n\n19:50.060 --> 19:52.660\n I was working on some fraud prevention stuff, for instance.\n\n19:52.660 --> 19:55.280\n And I read the Bitcoin white paper\n\n19:55.280 --> 19:57.020\n in kind of December of 2010.\n\n19:57.900 --> 20:01.020\n I started going to some Bitcoin meetups in the Bay Area,\n\n20:01.020 --> 20:02.300\n met lots of interesting people there,\n\n20:02.300 --> 20:04.740\n like crazy people, anarchists,\n\n20:04.740 --> 20:06.860\n really brilliant people, all the above.\n\n20:06.860 --> 20:09.220\n And so I started nights and weekends\n\n20:09.220 --> 20:11.220\n trying to put together a prototype.\n\n20:11.220 --> 20:12.660\n And my initial thought was,\n\n20:13.700 --> 20:16.700\n well, SMTP is a protocol that runs email.\n\n20:16.700 --> 20:21.140\n And Git is a protocol for version control\n\n20:21.140 --> 20:23.380\n that people made like Gmail and GitHub.\n\n20:23.380 --> 20:25.500\n Most people don't wanna run their own email server\n\n20:25.500 --> 20:26.860\n or even their own Git server.\n\n20:26.860 --> 20:28.920\n They just wanna like use a hosted thing\n\n20:28.920 --> 20:31.700\n that will do all the security and backups for them.\n\n20:31.700 --> 20:33.020\n So the thought in my head at that time\n\n20:33.020 --> 20:34.620\n was Bitcoin's this new protocol.\n\n20:34.620 --> 20:35.620\n There's probably gonna be somebody\n\n20:35.620 --> 20:37.460\n who makes a hosted service\n\n20:37.460 --> 20:39.300\n that does all the security and backups for you,\n\n20:39.300 --> 20:42.100\n makes Bitcoin as a protocol easy to use.\n\n20:42.100 --> 20:45.860\n So maybe I should make like a hosted Bitcoin wallet\n\n20:45.860 --> 20:47.180\n or something, that was my,\n\n20:47.180 --> 20:50.020\n it was gonna make Gmail for Bitcoin or something.\n\n20:50.020 --> 20:52.860\n And a bunch of people told me that was a bad idea.\n\n20:52.860 --> 20:55.060\n Like most of my smart friends who I told about it,\n\n20:55.060 --> 20:55.900\n they were like,\n\n20:56.920 --> 20:57.980\n well, first of all,\n\n20:57.980 --> 20:59.460\n I don't really get what you're doing at all.\n\n20:59.460 --> 21:01.100\n Like Bitcoin sounds like a scam\n\n21:01.100 --> 21:03.060\n or something you've gotten involved in.\n\n21:04.180 --> 21:06.020\n But then other people who understood what Bitcoin was\n\n21:06.020 --> 21:07.100\n told me they thought it was a dumb idea\n\n21:07.100 --> 21:09.960\n because they're like, dude, if you store all this Bitcoin,\n\n21:09.960 --> 21:10.820\n you're just gonna get hacked.\n\n21:10.820 --> 21:14.820\n Like nobody, you know, why would you do that?\n\n21:14.820 --> 21:18.180\n And so I kind of had this thought like, you know what?\n\n21:18.180 --> 21:21.140\n I'm not gonna go all in and like make a store\n\n21:21.140 --> 21:22.700\n everyone's Bitcoin, that would be too much right now.\n\n21:22.700 --> 21:25.060\n I have a job, I have a day job, you know?\n\n21:25.060 --> 21:26.580\n But let me just make a prototype\n\n21:26.580 --> 21:28.300\n and I'll tell people this is like a beta thing.\n\n21:28.300 --> 21:29.580\n Like don't put any real money in it\n\n21:29.580 --> 21:31.100\n and just see if there's interest.\n\n21:31.100 --> 21:32.280\n And if I feel like I'm onto something,\n\n21:32.280 --> 21:33.860\n maybe I'll go do this as a company.\n\n21:33.860 --> 21:35.460\n Cause I did, I really wanted to be an entrepreneur\n\n21:35.460 --> 21:36.300\n at that time.\n\n21:36.300 --> 21:38.700\n I was like, I was 29, I was almost turning 30.\n\n21:38.700 --> 21:40.520\n And I was, I always wanted to like start a company,\n\n21:40.520 --> 21:43.580\n but I was, you know, I wasn't yet.\n\n21:43.580 --> 21:45.020\n I was an employee at a company that was great.\n\n21:45.020 --> 21:47.740\n But so anyway, I had this prototype.\n\n21:47.740 --> 21:50.300\n I was hacking together nights and weekends.\n\n21:50.300 --> 21:53.900\n I actually wrote a whole Bitcoin node in Ruby,\n\n21:53.900 --> 21:55.760\n which turned out to be a, maybe a weird decision\n\n21:55.760 --> 21:57.200\n in hindsight, cause Ruby wasn't the most\n\n21:57.200 --> 21:58.040\n performant language.\n\n21:58.040 --> 21:59.680\n We've subsequently had to rebuild that many times.\n\n21:59.680 --> 22:03.140\n But yeah, I had this hosted Bitcoin wallet\n\n22:03.140 --> 22:05.980\n and the thing that I didn't have any users for it,\n\n22:05.980 --> 22:08.020\n by the way, I applied to Y Combinator\n\n22:08.020 --> 22:10.700\n cause I was like, maybe if somebody there writes me a check,\n\n22:10.700 --> 22:12.340\n this will like make it feel like a real company.\n\n22:12.340 --> 22:14.660\n And I was trying to find a co founder at that time\n\n22:14.660 --> 22:16.100\n unsuccessfully.\n\n22:16.100 --> 22:18.220\n So I was basically just wandering in the desert.\n\n22:18.220 --> 22:21.580\n I had a lot of self doubt about this cause I was like,\n\n22:21.580 --> 22:24.220\n I don't know, all my friends don't think this is kind of dumb\n\n22:24.220 --> 22:27.380\n and maybe Bitcoin is just gonna get shut down\n\n22:27.380 --> 22:29.020\n and like, this is all be some stupid thing.\n\n22:29.020 --> 22:31.820\n So there was definitely a feeling of just wandering\n\n22:31.820 --> 22:33.780\n lost in the desert, lots of self doubt.\n\n22:35.020 --> 22:37.180\n Paul Graham and the Y Combinator group\n\n22:37.180 --> 22:38.580\n kind of wrote me the first check\n\n22:38.580 --> 22:39.860\n after I went and interviewed and stuff.\n\n22:39.860 --> 22:42.380\n And they wrote me a check for like 150K.\n\n22:42.380 --> 22:43.980\n And that was the first time somebody\n\n22:43.980 --> 22:46.020\n who I really looked up to kind of said,\n\n22:46.020 --> 22:47.540\n this is worth pursuing.\n\n22:47.540 --> 22:49.240\n Like maybe you're onto something, maybe you're not,\n\n22:49.240 --> 22:50.940\n but like, let's at least try it.\n\n22:50.940 --> 22:53.740\n And so that was kind of what gave me the confidence\n\n22:53.740 --> 22:55.420\n to quit my job and try it.\n\n22:55.420 --> 22:59.820\n And I'll wrap the story here by saying that like we,\n\n22:59.820 --> 23:02.860\n I found the right co founder after Y Combinator.\n\n23:02.860 --> 23:03.980\n We still didn't have any customers.\n\n23:03.980 --> 23:05.220\n The thing that,\n\n23:05.220 --> 23:07.600\n I basically launched the hosted Bitcoin wallet.\n\n23:07.600 --> 23:09.100\n There were people signing up.\n\n23:09.100 --> 23:11.300\n I just posted on Reddit and places like that.\n\n23:11.300 --> 23:13.300\n And maybe like a hundred people would sign up\n\n23:13.300 --> 23:14.980\n and then nobody would come back.\n\n23:14.980 --> 23:18.300\n And so I was like, I just in Y Combinator,\n\n23:18.300 --> 23:20.300\n they often tell you like,\n\n23:20.300 --> 23:21.860\n talk to your customers and improve your product.\n\n23:21.860 --> 23:23.140\n Talk to your customers, improve your product.\n\n23:23.140 --> 23:24.220\n That's all you're supposed to be doing.\n\n23:24.220 --> 23:25.760\n Try to find product market fit.\n\n23:25.760 --> 23:28.820\n So I emailed like five of the users that had signed up\n\n23:28.820 --> 23:30.540\n and I was like, hey, I worked on this app.\n\n23:30.540 --> 23:31.380\n I saw you signed up.\n\n23:31.380 --> 23:32.200\n Can I get on the phone with you?\n\n23:32.200 --> 23:34.420\n I get on the phone with like five of these folks.\n\n23:34.420 --> 23:36.820\n And I was like, why didn't you come back?\n\n23:36.820 --> 23:38.860\n And the guy was like, well, the app was okay\n\n23:38.860 --> 23:41.620\n for a beta, but like, I don't have any Bitcoins.\n\n23:41.620 --> 23:43.380\n So I didn't really know what to do with it.\n\n23:43.380 --> 23:45.000\n And I remember this light bulb kind of went off in my head.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:48.040\n I was like, well, if I put a buy Bitcoin button in there,\n\n23:48.900 --> 23:49.740\n would you have used it?\n\n23:49.740 --> 23:51.500\n And he was like, yeah, maybe.\n\n23:51.500 --> 23:54.180\n So then I had this, we went about the process.\n\n23:54.180 --> 23:55.140\n My co founder at that time,\n\n23:55.140 --> 23:57.920\n we like got basically had to get like a bank partnership,\n\n23:57.920 --> 23:59.300\n payment rails, you know, an exchange,\n\n23:59.300 --> 24:00.420\n basic exchange functionality,\n\n24:00.420 --> 24:03.620\n all that stuff I was mentioning earlier in place.\n\n24:03.620 --> 24:05.340\n And the minute we launched that feature\n\n24:05.340 --> 24:06.260\n where you could just click buy,\n\n24:06.260 --> 24:07.620\n put in your bank counter credit card,\n\n24:07.620 --> 24:09.580\n buy Bitcoin, it showed up in your account.\n\n24:09.580 --> 24:10.400\n From that day forward,\n\n24:10.400 --> 24:12.620\n like the number of users started to go up like this.\n\n24:12.620 --> 24:14.980\n And so we finally had found product market fit\n\n24:14.980 --> 24:17.140\n after two years of wandering in the desert.\n\n24:17.140 --> 24:20.460\n So you weren't even thinking about to buy the on ramps.\n\n24:20.460 --> 24:22.060\n You would think it would be just the wallet,\n\n24:22.060 --> 24:26.340\n a place to store Bitcoin that you've already gotten.\n\n24:26.340 --> 24:27.500\n Yeah. Okay.\n\n24:27.500 --> 24:31.140\n This is, I mean, cause that's such a pain to do,\n\n24:31.140 --> 24:34.380\n to have to work with others to convert dollars\n\n24:34.380 --> 24:37.820\n and fiat currency into Bitcoin.\n\n24:37.820 --> 24:38.660\n Yeah.\n\n24:38.660 --> 24:39.700\n So did you, I mean,\n\n24:39.700 --> 24:44.700\n were you overwhelmed by the immensity of the task here\n\n24:45.400 --> 24:50.400\n or were you just sort of not allowing yourself\n\n24:51.860 --> 24:53.860\n to think too deeply through this whole thing\n\n24:53.860 --> 24:57.180\n and just letting the optimism take over here?\n\n24:59.020 --> 25:00.560\n You know, I was really looking forward\n\n25:00.560 --> 25:03.300\n to like doing something crazy and like a big challenge.\n\n25:03.300 --> 25:08.300\n And I wanted to, I love kind of crisis moments like that\n\n25:09.580 --> 25:12.300\n where, you know, I'm very determined, right?\n\n25:12.300 --> 25:14.820\n And especially when I get like very set on something\n\n25:14.820 --> 25:15.700\n and I'm just like, you know what?\n\n25:15.700 --> 25:18.420\n I'm gonna figure out a way to make this fucking thing work,\n\n25:18.420 --> 25:19.700\n like no matter what.\n\n25:19.700 --> 25:23.160\n And so I reveled in that.\n\n25:23.160 --> 25:26.220\n I was sort of, I had read all these books about startups\n\n25:26.220 --> 25:28.140\n and like every startup has these like, you know,\n\n25:28.140 --> 25:30.340\n major setbacks and just like nothing works.\n\n25:30.340 --> 25:33.460\n And so that was a sign that you're doing something right.\n\n25:33.460 --> 25:35.500\n I had no idea if I was doing anything right at all,\n\n25:35.500 --> 25:38.260\n but I was like, I was kind of loving the experience of it\n\n25:38.260 --> 25:39.100\n in a weird way.\n\n25:39.100 --> 25:41.000\n It felt, it felt stressful at the time.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.820\n Like, you know, nothing was working and,\n\n25:43.820 --> 25:47.220\n but I was just, I felt like I was on the right path somehow.\n\n25:47.220 --> 25:49.220\n And so I just kept going, I don't know.\n\n25:50.940 --> 25:53.940\n What was the darkest moment that you've gone to\n\n25:53.940 --> 25:56.500\n in your mind during that time?\n\n25:56.500 --> 25:58.700\n What was, what were some of the tougher moments?\n\n25:58.700 --> 26:00.460\n You said self doubt.\n\n26:00.460 --> 26:01.860\n Yeah.\n\n26:01.860 --> 26:04.700\n Have you, yeah, where'd you go?\n\n26:04.700 --> 26:06.020\n Where'd you go in your mind?\n\n26:06.020 --> 26:10.460\n Is there a moment where you're just like laying there?\n\n26:10.460 --> 26:12.220\n This is, this is hopeless.\n\n26:13.380 --> 26:15.500\n Well, there's a couple of moments I'm remembering.\n\n26:15.500 --> 26:18.280\n I mean, so for whatever reason,\n\n26:18.280 --> 26:20.780\n I had this like big chip on my shoulder at that time.\n\n26:20.780 --> 26:21.900\n And I was like,\n\n26:21.900 --> 26:23.900\n I really want to do something important in the world.\n\n26:23.900 --> 26:26.260\n Like, you know, I could have a good life\n\n26:26.260 --> 26:27.860\n and like work for some good companies\n\n26:27.860 --> 26:29.100\n and write some software.\n\n26:29.100 --> 26:31.940\n And I'm, for some reason, I never wanted that for myself.\n\n26:31.940 --> 26:33.340\n That probably would have been healthier, honestly,\n\n26:33.340 --> 26:35.860\n just to like, as an expected value outcome,\n\n26:35.860 --> 26:38.020\n that's probably a better thing in life.\n\n26:38.020 --> 26:40.260\n But I was like, I was like, man,\n\n26:40.260 --> 26:41.940\n I really want to do something important\n\n26:41.940 --> 26:43.140\n and have a bigger impact.\n\n26:43.140 --> 26:46.220\n And I was like, I was willing to sacrifice a lot for that.\n\n26:46.220 --> 26:49.620\n I was like sleep and not going out with friends and stuff.\n\n26:49.620 --> 26:50.660\n I remember one of the,\n\n26:50.660 --> 26:52.740\n just for like years working on this stuff,\n\n26:52.740 --> 26:55.940\n I remember one of the darker moments was,\n\n26:55.940 --> 27:00.160\n we probably had like maybe five employees at that time.\n\n27:00.160 --> 27:03.560\n And I remember like a bunch of bad things happened\n\n27:03.560 --> 27:04.440\n like all at once.\n\n27:04.440 --> 27:06.660\n And it was, so first of all,\n\n27:06.660 --> 27:08.860\n you have to remember at this time,\n\n27:08.860 --> 27:10.400\n we were all very sleep deprived,\n\n27:10.400 --> 27:11.900\n which kind of exacerbates everything.\n\n27:11.900 --> 27:14.460\n If you look at like the Exxon Valdez spill\n\n27:14.460 --> 27:16.300\n and all these like natural disasters,\n\n27:16.300 --> 27:18.520\n like sleep deprivation is often involved.\n\n27:18.520 --> 27:20.960\n So, because the reason why we were so sleep deprived\n\n27:20.960 --> 27:22.080\n is not just because we were working so much,\n\n27:22.080 --> 27:25.240\n but like the site would go offline in the middle of the night\n\n27:25.240 --> 27:26.280\n and we'd get, I'd get paged.\n\n27:26.280 --> 27:27.180\n I was like on pager duty.\n\n27:27.180 --> 27:28.280\n So I'd get woken up sometimes\n\n27:28.280 --> 27:29.400\n like two or three times a night,\n\n27:29.400 --> 27:31.920\n like have to try to fix something, go back to sleep.\n\n27:31.920 --> 27:35.000\n So in that environment, you can kind of get,\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.040\n you can get discouraged.\n\n27:37.040 --> 27:39.360\n So one bad thing that happened was,\n\n27:39.360 --> 27:40.680\n we had a bug on the website\n\n27:40.680 --> 27:43.760\n and there was thousands of people on Reddit and Twitter\n\n27:43.760 --> 27:46.640\n who were all like pissed at Coinbase\n\n27:46.640 --> 27:48.320\n because like the balances were showing wrong.\n\n27:48.320 --> 27:51.580\n And they were just like, fuck this company, it's over.\n\n27:51.580 --> 27:52.520\n Like, I hate these guys.\n\n27:52.520 --> 27:55.320\n And so that was, I'd never had this feeling\n\n27:55.320 --> 27:57.280\n of a thousand people mad at me at the same time.\n\n27:57.280 --> 27:58.840\n You know, I feel like I'm a pretty chill guy.\n\n27:58.840 --> 28:00.440\n Like most of the time people don't get mad at me.\n\n28:00.440 --> 28:02.080\n So that was one.\n\n28:02.080 --> 28:03.400\n Another one was that.\n\n28:03.400 --> 28:04.240\n Can we pause on that?\n\n28:04.240 --> 28:05.220\n That's so interesting.\n\n28:05.220 --> 28:07.100\n So you were saying like, here's a dream.\n\n28:07.100 --> 28:08.660\n I'm trying to create something.\n\n28:08.660 --> 28:13.200\n And now forever, the reputation of this dream is ruined.\n\n28:13.200 --> 28:15.000\n It will never, it's irrecoverable.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.220\n It's over, that kind of feeling.\n\n28:17.220 --> 28:18.640\n Yeah, well, I didn't, you're right.\n\n28:18.640 --> 28:19.600\n I didn't know at that time.\n\n28:19.600 --> 28:21.640\n I was like, is this, is this the end?\n\n28:21.640 --> 28:24.200\n Like everybody, we're so, we're so tiny.\n\n28:24.200 --> 28:25.120\n Now everybody hates us.\n\n28:25.120 --> 28:26.320\n So is it over?\n\n28:26.320 --> 28:27.160\n Yeah.\n\n28:28.760 --> 28:30.760\n Nobody told me this before starting a company\n\n28:30.760 --> 28:33.560\n that like, you're a bunch of people will hate you for this,\n\n28:33.560 --> 28:35.200\n which is like a very counterintuitive thing.\n\n28:35.200 --> 28:38.200\n Cause you know, most companies I think are doing\n\n28:38.200 --> 28:39.760\n good things in the world, at least you're trying, right?\n\n28:39.760 --> 28:41.960\n And so even if someone's like trying,\n\n28:41.960 --> 28:42.840\n but they're not, they're failing,\n\n28:42.840 --> 28:43.920\n I'm generally rooting for them.\n\n28:43.920 --> 28:45.360\n At least you're trying, right?\n\n28:45.360 --> 28:47.080\n But that's not the case at all.\n\n28:47.080 --> 28:50.160\n And most founders I've known have gone through this too,\n\n28:50.160 --> 28:53.320\n where they're very surprised at the amount of hate\n\n28:53.320 --> 28:54.160\n that they get.\n\n28:54.160 --> 28:55.920\n And if it's, I think it's actually like a muscle\n\n28:55.920 --> 28:57.720\n you can build your tolerance to it.\n\n28:57.720 --> 29:01.440\n Like, because you know, you go talk to somebody who's like,\n\n29:01.440 --> 29:02.400\n for you, it feels terrible\n\n29:02.400 --> 29:04.480\n cause you're at the center of this storm and like,\n\n29:04.480 --> 29:06.360\n but if you go, then you go talk to like, you know,\n\n29:06.360 --> 29:08.120\n your family or some other person like, dude,\n\n29:08.120 --> 29:08.960\n I didn't even hear about that.\n\n29:08.960 --> 29:11.300\n Like my, they're just busy in their own life.\n\n29:11.300 --> 29:13.400\n And so they, they have no idea\n\n29:13.400 --> 29:14.800\n that you had all this negative press\n\n29:14.800 --> 29:16.500\n or like whatever it was.\n\n29:16.500 --> 29:19.000\n Can I put once again, put a link on that?\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:20.400\n Yeah.\n\n29:20.400 --> 29:23.520\n There's an interesting person I'd like to bring up\n\n29:23.520 --> 29:26.480\n just as an example, Bill Gates.\n\n29:26.480 --> 29:27.600\n Yeah.\n\n29:27.600 --> 29:31.560\n So he gets a very large amount of hate on the internet.\n\n29:31.560 --> 29:32.400\n Yeah.\n\n29:32.400 --> 29:34.240\n And there's something about him,\n\n29:34.240 --> 29:35.440\n this is me talking that you,\n\n29:35.440 --> 29:38.940\n that he seems out of touch about that hate.\n\n29:39.960 --> 29:43.440\n I believe at least in my understanding\n\n29:43.440 --> 29:46.280\n that with the resources he has,\n\n29:46.280 --> 29:49.520\n he's trying and is actually doing a lot of good.\n\n29:50.360 --> 29:52.640\n And yet there's a gigantic amount of hate,\n\n29:52.640 --> 29:54.660\n conspiracy theories and stuff like that.\n\n29:54.660 --> 29:55.500\n Right.\n\n29:55.500 --> 29:57.960\n And it feels like that's the case\n\n29:57.960 --> 30:02.080\n because he's somehow out of touch with people.\n\n30:02.080 --> 30:04.360\n So I wonder how you stay in touch\n\n30:04.360 --> 30:05.520\n with the voice of the people\n\n30:05.520 --> 30:08.800\n without being destroyed by the outrage.\n\n30:08.800 --> 30:11.160\n Is there any wisdom you have to that or?\n\n30:11.160 --> 30:14.440\n I don't know about wisdom, but I've thought about this too,\n\n30:14.440 --> 30:19.080\n because yeah, you wanna always be open to feedback,\n\n30:19.080 --> 30:20.160\n especially from people who have\n\n30:20.160 --> 30:22.380\n like your best interests at heart, right?\n\n30:22.380 --> 30:25.440\n And if you can become isolated from it\n\n30:25.440 --> 30:28.320\n and just like, you know, surrounded by yes people.\n\n30:28.320 --> 30:32.480\n And I mean, who knows, maybe like she and Putin\n\n30:32.480 --> 30:35.180\n and people like that are in situations I have no idea.\n\n30:36.660 --> 30:39.080\n But if you listen to too much of it\n\n30:39.080 --> 30:40.260\n and you just try to please everyone,\n\n30:40.260 --> 30:41.460\n you'll never get anything done.\n\n30:41.460 --> 30:44.880\n And I mean, most of the best leaders are people\n\n30:44.880 --> 30:47.900\n who they can act when they believe\n\n30:47.900 --> 30:49.740\n that they're doing something net positive\n\n30:49.740 --> 30:51.520\n for the world and humanity.\n\n30:51.520 --> 30:52.720\n And they actually don't really care\n\n30:52.720 --> 30:55.600\n if they piss off some portion of the people.\n\n30:55.600 --> 30:58.160\n Almost anything you're gonna do of significance\n\n30:58.160 --> 31:01.080\n in the world today is gonna piss off 5% of people,\n\n31:01.080 --> 31:04.840\n maybe 49% of people or whatever, maybe 60%, I don't know.\n\n31:04.840 --> 31:07.700\n So you never wanna become so surrounded\n\n31:07.700 --> 31:09.720\n by people who just work for you and will say yes.\n\n31:09.720 --> 31:11.480\n And then you think like, well, I'm a genius\n\n31:11.480 --> 31:15.240\n and I'm like, that's how you become a dictator or whatever.\n\n31:15.240 --> 31:18.080\n But you also can't care so much about what people think\n\n31:18.080 --> 31:19.320\n because then you'll never do anything\n\n31:19.320 --> 31:21.560\n that's truly authentic to yourself.\n\n31:21.560 --> 31:22.800\n One other thought on that, by the way,\n\n31:22.800 --> 31:25.120\n I think it's a really good question.\n\n31:25.120 --> 31:26.520\n So I've thought about this a lot.\n\n31:26.520 --> 31:29.560\n Like why, you know, people generally kind of hate on Zuck\n\n31:29.560 --> 31:32.360\n and they hate on Bill Gates and they hate on,\n\n31:33.400 --> 31:34.800\n they don't really hate on Elon.\n\n31:34.800 --> 31:36.040\n Well, actually Elon has a lot of haters too,\n\n31:36.040 --> 31:37.360\n but it's a different thing.\n\n31:37.360 --> 31:40.160\n This is measured, this is measured, I was looking\n\n31:40.160 --> 31:43.800\n at some surveys, so I think Zuck is the most,\n\n31:43.800 --> 31:45.600\n so loved and hated, right?\n\n31:46.520 --> 31:50.720\n Zuckerberg is the most, both loved and hated.\n\n31:50.720 --> 31:52.280\n He's the most hated.\n\n31:52.280 --> 31:55.280\n And then I think it's Bill Gates and Elon is down there.\n\n31:55.280 --> 31:59.880\n I think it's like 40% hate Zuck, people asked.\n\n31:59.880 --> 32:02.600\n And then Elon is in the double digits,\n\n32:02.600 --> 32:04.200\n but low double digits.\n\n32:04.200 --> 32:06.760\n And so it's interesting, you just look at this data,\n\n32:06.760 --> 32:08.080\n ask yourself why.\n\n32:08.080 --> 32:10.400\n Right, so I ask myself this sometimes too,\n\n32:10.400 --> 32:13.080\n because I don't claim to know any of these people well,\n\n32:13.080 --> 32:15.080\n but like I've met them briefly.\n\n32:15.080 --> 32:17.720\n And my impression is that they're actually all smart people\n\n32:17.720 --> 32:18.760\n trying to do good things in the world.\n\n32:18.760 --> 32:21.120\n So there's not too much difference there,\n\n32:21.120 --> 32:23.280\n despite public perception.\n\n32:23.280 --> 32:25.440\n So why is it that some are really hated and some aren't?\n\n32:25.440 --> 32:28.080\n I mean, it's a complicated question.\n\n32:28.080 --> 32:31.240\n Obviously Zuck in his Facebook got blamed\n\n32:31.240 --> 32:34.240\n for the whole election thing and all that didn't help.\n\n32:34.240 --> 32:36.280\n Social media has gotten a lot of pressure\n\n32:36.280 --> 32:39.640\n just from like, hey, why aren't you solving\n\n32:39.640 --> 32:40.800\n all of society's tough problems?\n\n32:40.800 --> 32:42.640\n It's like, well, they're just one company.\n\n32:42.640 --> 32:47.520\n But one thing I've noticed is that a lot of these people,\n\n32:47.520 --> 32:49.800\n they have like Asperger's, right, a little bit.\n\n32:49.800 --> 32:53.360\n And sometimes people with Asperger's\n\n32:53.360 --> 32:54.760\n don't really emote in the same way.\n\n32:54.760 --> 32:57.000\n And so I think it's almost a form of like\n\n33:00.840 --> 33:05.840\n bias against their cognitive type or something,\n\n33:05.840 --> 33:07.960\n which is like that person doesn't emote right.\n\n33:07.960 --> 33:11.320\n I don't trust their intentions.\n\n33:11.320 --> 33:14.440\n And the other thing I've thought about too\n\n33:14.440 --> 33:16.840\n is that sometimes I think some leaders,\n\n33:18.040 --> 33:19.320\n like maybe Zuck or Bill Gates,\n\n33:19.320 --> 33:22.960\n they can come across as like a little bit PR rehearsed.\n\n33:22.960 --> 33:24.920\n Like they're basically,\n\n33:24.920 --> 33:26.960\n they're giving the PR approved answers\n\n33:26.960 --> 33:29.720\n where Elon just says whatever he thinks like to a fault.\n\n33:29.720 --> 33:31.320\n So even if people hate what he says or like,\n\n33:31.320 --> 33:33.240\n at least I believe it's authentic.\n\n33:33.240 --> 33:34.960\n So I've always thought about that too for myself.\n\n33:34.960 --> 33:36.520\n I'm like, how do I,\n\n33:36.520 --> 33:38.480\n cause you can fuck it up on both sides, right?\n\n33:38.480 --> 33:39.960\n Like if you just come out and you're like saying\n\n33:39.960 --> 33:42.240\n whatever stream of consciousness,\n\n33:42.240 --> 33:44.680\n you'll often end up like pissing off people on your team\n\n33:44.680 --> 33:47.520\n or like saying tripping over some like regulation\n\n33:47.520 --> 33:50.400\n that you've, there's all kinds of things\n\n33:50.400 --> 33:51.680\n about running a public company,\n\n33:51.680 --> 33:53.120\n you can't say certain stuff.\n\n33:53.120 --> 33:56.360\n But if you're too PR approved and your answer is like,\n\n33:56.360 --> 33:58.280\n nobody trusts you what you're saying.\n\n33:58.280 --> 34:00.480\n And so anyway, this is something I think about a lot.\n\n34:00.480 --> 34:01.560\n I don't think I have the right answer,\n\n34:01.560 --> 34:02.800\n but I'm trying to find that balance.\n\n34:02.800 --> 34:05.360\n And more and more with the internet, there's a premium\n\n34:05.360 --> 34:07.600\n on authenticity, just like you're saying.\n\n34:07.600 --> 34:09.080\n People really, really appreciate that.\n\n34:09.080 --> 34:11.960\n So for leaders, it's a challenge to be,\n\n34:11.960 --> 34:15.640\n how do I make sure I'm authentic,\n\n34:15.640 --> 34:19.600\n but also don't say stupid shit.\n\n34:19.600 --> 34:21.000\n And so that's an interesting thing.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.720\n I've noticed that just having interacted\n\n34:23.720 --> 34:28.720\n with a bunch of leaders that you have to be careful\n\n34:28.920 --> 34:31.960\n how much you surround yourself with PR folks.\n\n34:31.960 --> 34:34.520\n Because the best, I would say, let me just say a nice thing\n\n34:34.520 --> 34:36.360\n about marketing and PR folks,\n\n34:36.360 --> 34:40.720\n the best marketing folks are extremely good.\n\n34:40.720 --> 34:43.680\n So they understand exactly what great marketing is\n\n34:43.680 --> 34:46.080\n and great PR, it's authenticity.\n\n34:46.080 --> 34:48.300\n It's showing, revealing the beauty.\n\n34:48.300 --> 34:51.500\n As opposed to PR and marketing out of fear.\n\n34:51.500 --> 34:54.440\n Oh, don't say that, don't say this, don't that.\n\n34:54.440 --> 34:57.140\n Because then you start living in this kind of,\n\n34:57.140 --> 34:58.520\n that pushes you towards a bubble\n\n34:58.520 --> 35:00.280\n where you can't express the,\n\n35:00.280 --> 35:02.040\n your beautiful quirks and weirdness\n\n35:02.040 --> 35:03.280\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n35:03.280 --> 35:06.060\n And also the cool, the beautiful things\n\n35:06.060 --> 35:07.120\n about what you're doing.\n\n35:07.120 --> 35:10.280\n I find like, especially with tech things,\n\n35:10.280 --> 35:12.120\n like even like Coinbase,\n\n35:12.120 --> 35:15.080\n the way to reveal the beauty of it\n\n35:15.080 --> 35:18.460\n is not only by showing all the things you could do with it,\n\n35:18.460 --> 35:20.640\n but showing that there's great engineering\n\n35:20.640 --> 35:22.180\n going on underneath.\n\n35:22.180 --> 35:23.760\n So letting the nerds shine too.\n\n35:23.760 --> 35:28.540\n It doesn't have to be like these kind of commercials\n\n35:28.540 --> 35:33.500\n where it's like a happy family using Coinbase\n\n35:33.500 --> 35:36.680\n to send a transaction about flowers for mom\n\n35:36.680 --> 35:37.680\n or something like that.\n\n35:37.680 --> 35:41.600\n Like it could be also like gritty stuff and real stuff.\n\n35:41.600 --> 35:45.280\n So that's a general just observation I made.\n\n35:45.280 --> 35:46.960\n But you said you were talking about dark moments\n\n35:46.960 --> 35:49.040\n and that there's people on the internet\n\n35:49.040 --> 35:51.200\n that were pissed off that the site was down.\n\n35:51.200 --> 35:54.080\n And you said there might be something else.\n\n35:54.080 --> 35:55.860\n Yeah, so sleep deprived,\n\n35:55.860 --> 35:57.800\n like a bunch of people on the internet were pissed at me.\n\n35:57.800 --> 35:59.440\n The balances were fucked up.\n\n35:59.440 --> 36:01.200\n Like people were tweeting the company's over,\n\n36:01.200 --> 36:03.600\n just give the money back, whatever.\n\n36:03.600 --> 36:07.800\n And then, oh yeah, somebody posted.\n\n36:07.800 --> 36:09.520\n So we had all this, we didn't,\n\n36:09.520 --> 36:11.300\n we started to get all these customer support inquiries\n\n36:11.300 --> 36:14.200\n and like, we only had like a few people at the company.\n\n36:14.200 --> 36:18.000\n And so we were backed up maybe like 20,000 support requests.\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:19.760\n So people couldn't get ahold of us.\n\n36:19.760 --> 36:22.800\n So somebody posted my cell phone number on Reddit\n\n36:22.800 --> 36:24.220\n and they were like, they were like,\n\n36:24.220 --> 36:25.800\n if you need to get ahold of the CEO, whatever,\n\n36:25.800 --> 36:28.240\n cause everyone's upset about where their money is.\n\n36:28.240 --> 36:30.000\n So I remember we're in the office,\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:31.460\n it's like late at night.\n\n36:31.460 --> 36:33.560\n We've been working like 12 hours, we're all sleep deprived.\n\n36:33.560 --> 36:36.640\n I'm trying to hack and like get this bug fixed.\n\n36:36.640 --> 36:38.680\n And we all need like food at the office.\n\n36:38.680 --> 36:41.040\n And so my phone has been blowing up all day\n\n36:41.040 --> 36:43.040\n cause someone posted my phone number on the internet.\n\n36:43.040 --> 36:44.140\n And there's like a guy,\n\n36:45.360 --> 36:46.960\n there was a guy like trying to deliver food\n\n36:46.960 --> 36:48.480\n and I needed to answer my phone\n\n36:48.480 --> 36:50.440\n to like get the food from downstairs.\n\n36:50.440 --> 36:53.000\n So I was like, shit, I gotta just see who, if that's him.\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.960\n So I started answering the call and it's like,\n\n36:55.960 --> 36:56.780\n is this Brian?\n\n36:56.780 --> 36:58.480\n I'm like, nope, wrong number, click.\n\n36:58.480 --> 37:00.920\n And I pick up the next call.\n\n37:00.920 --> 37:02.640\n It's like every, when I finished the call,\n\n37:02.640 --> 37:03.480\n another call is like coming in.\n\n37:03.480 --> 37:06.400\n So I was like, I'm a reporter from Japan,\n\n37:06.400 --> 37:09.040\n like asking about a security, nope, wrong number, click.\n\n37:09.040 --> 37:11.120\n And then I like, finally I get the delivery guy downstairs,\n\n37:11.120 --> 37:11.960\n bring the food up.\n\n37:11.960 --> 37:15.220\n We were all like surviving to like fix this bug.\n\n37:17.080 --> 37:18.980\n I remember there was just basically a point that night\n\n37:18.980 --> 37:20.660\n where I was like, fuck, I need to just,\n\n37:20.660 --> 37:24.440\n I basically just curled up on like a ball on the floor.\n\n37:24.440 --> 37:27.320\n And I just like cried for a little bit.\n\n37:28.440 --> 37:31.040\n I think I let myself just kind of wallow in self pity,\n\n37:31.040 --> 37:32.760\n kind of took a nap for about five minutes.\n\n37:32.760 --> 37:35.160\n And I was like, let's fucking solve this.\n\n37:35.160 --> 37:38.320\n And I like, you know, stop being like a little whatever\n\n37:38.320 --> 37:39.800\n and like got back up.\n\n37:39.800 --> 37:42.200\n Sleep deprivation combined with just the stress\n\n37:42.200 --> 37:44.720\n and the pressure of the site going down\n\n37:44.720 --> 37:47.080\n and everybody wants the site to be up.\n\n37:47.080 --> 37:48.640\n Just the pressure from people\n\n37:48.640 --> 37:51.360\n and the number of users is growing and growing and growing.\n\n37:51.360 --> 37:54.600\n So that pressure is just mentally, mentally tough.\n\n37:54.600 --> 37:57.380\n What was your source of strength during that time?\n\n37:58.320 --> 38:02.100\n Like what, like somebody that patted you on the back\n\n38:02.100 --> 38:04.160\n and said, we got this.\n\n38:04.160 --> 38:06.800\n Yeah, well, it definitely helped to have a co founder.\n\n38:06.800 --> 38:10.000\n So, you know, there's like that old saying about\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.280\n it's better to be in a great relationship than to be single,\n\n38:12.280 --> 38:14.000\n but it's better to be single than in a bad relationship.\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:17.320\n So co founders actually blow up a lot of companies too.\n\n38:17.320 --> 38:18.680\n But when you find the right co founder,\n\n38:18.680 --> 38:21.560\n which I was lucky to find with, with Fred or some,\n\n38:21.560 --> 38:22.520\n that was very important.\n\n38:22.520 --> 38:24.920\n There was definitely moments where, you know,\n\n38:24.920 --> 38:28.840\n I was like kind of, you know, at the width end or whatever.\n\n38:28.840 --> 38:31.600\n And he was like, it's like, dude, let's rally.\n\n38:31.600 --> 38:33.440\n Like, and he basically carried the team, you know,\n\n38:33.440 --> 38:35.440\n a couple of times, like in really key moments.\n\n38:35.440 --> 38:39.060\n What advice would you give to startup founders\n\n38:39.060 --> 38:43.480\n about this particular stage about surviving it\n\n38:43.480 --> 38:46.760\n to the five and through the five employees stage\n\n38:46.760 --> 38:47.600\n where you were?\n\n38:47.600 --> 38:50.040\n Yeah, well, if your pre product market fit,\n\n38:50.040 --> 38:52.760\n the best advice that I have from that period\n\n38:52.760 --> 38:55.800\n is action produces information.\n\n38:55.800 --> 38:58.800\n So just like keep doing stuff, you know,\n\n38:58.800 --> 39:03.800\n I remember like Paul Graham, Paul Graham had this great\n\n39:04.920 --> 39:05.740\n line like that.\n\n39:05.740 --> 39:06.580\n I think that's his line.\n\n39:06.580 --> 39:08.560\n And he was like, startups are like sharks.\n\n39:08.560 --> 39:10.520\n If they stop swimming, they die.\n\n39:10.520 --> 39:12.320\n You know, so even if you're like, not sure what to do,\n\n39:12.320 --> 39:14.440\n like just do anything because when you do it,\n\n39:14.440 --> 39:16.160\n it'll like, it'll produce some information.\n\n39:16.160 --> 39:17.000\n Like people liked it.\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:18.640\n They didn't, this was very true for me.\n\n39:18.640 --> 39:21.560\n There was times where I just did something\n\n39:22.640 --> 39:24.720\n instead of debating it endlessly and like, just try it.\n\n39:24.720 --> 39:25.560\n You know, like, all right.\n\n39:25.560 --> 39:26.380\n So we shipped it.\n\n39:26.380 --> 39:27.980\n And like, there was a couple of times where like\n\n39:27.980 --> 39:30.640\n the minute I shipped it and I was like, I knew,\n\n39:30.640 --> 39:32.880\n I know we built this wrong,\n\n39:32.880 --> 39:34.400\n but now I have an idea of what to do next.\n\n39:34.400 --> 39:36.520\n And it wasn't, I only would have had the idea\n\n39:36.520 --> 39:37.960\n if we'd actually gone through the exercise\n\n39:37.960 --> 39:38.920\n of going to build it.\n\n39:38.920 --> 39:41.680\n It's like my other favorite analogy for this is that\n\n39:42.660 --> 39:44.560\n you're like at the base of a mountain that's shrouded\n\n39:44.560 --> 39:47.120\n in fog and you're looking up at the mountain\n\n39:47.120 --> 39:48.180\n and you're trying to think like, okay,\n\n39:48.180 --> 39:49.020\n how do I get up there?\n\n39:49.020 --> 39:51.000\n But you can only see like three or four steps ahead\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:52.600\n cause the fog is so thick.\n\n39:52.600 --> 39:55.920\n So you have to just take steps into the unknown.\n\n39:55.920 --> 39:57.680\n And when you take three steps,\n\n39:57.680 --> 39:59.960\n another three steps will be revealed ahead of you.\n\n39:59.960 --> 40:01.940\n And sometimes you'll end up on some local maximum.\n\n40:01.940 --> 40:03.580\n You'll have to retrace your steps or whatever,\n\n40:03.580 --> 40:06.040\n but, or come up to a cliff, you know,\n\n40:06.040 --> 40:11.040\n but most people in life don't take the steps into the fog,\n\n40:11.480 --> 40:14.200\n into the unknown because it's scary.\n\n40:14.200 --> 40:15.860\n Or they're like, I don't know, what if I fail?\n\n40:15.860 --> 40:17.640\n Or like, I don't know how that's going to work\n\n40:17.640 --> 40:18.480\n or I might run out of money\n\n40:18.480 --> 40:19.800\n or I won't be able to get a job after,\n\n40:19.800 --> 40:21.720\n or I don't know, whatever reason.\n\n40:21.720 --> 40:24.520\n But that is like one of the things that separates,\n\n40:24.520 --> 40:27.180\n I think entrepreneurial people with that kind of inclination\n\n40:27.180 --> 40:31.720\n is that they have sort of a comfort with this risk tolerance\n\n40:31.720 --> 40:33.880\n but it's actually not really risky if you think about it.\n\n40:33.880 --> 40:38.200\n It's not like, you know, at least in most places,\n\n40:38.200 --> 40:40.800\n like, you know, if you go to a startup and it fails,\n\n40:40.800 --> 40:42.640\n like you're going to, you're even more valuable\n\n40:42.640 --> 40:44.180\n to your next employer, right?\n\n40:44.180 --> 40:47.260\n Or you can go raise a seed round, pay yourself a salary,\n\n40:47.260 --> 40:49.080\n try it for like two years or three years.\n\n40:49.080 --> 40:50.520\n If it doesn't work, go get another job.\n\n40:50.520 --> 40:51.520\n It's not like you're,\n\n40:51.520 --> 40:53.320\n you weren't paying yourself a salary during that time.\n\n40:53.320 --> 40:55.700\n So I think, I think people overestimate the risk\n\n40:55.700 --> 40:57.480\n of doing a startup and they just never,\n\n40:57.480 --> 41:00.960\n they never start because it seems crazy\n\n41:00.960 --> 41:02.140\n and all your friends think it's silly.\n\n41:02.140 --> 41:03.600\n Like that's sort of the default nature\n\n41:03.600 --> 41:05.600\n of every big startup idea.\n\n41:05.600 --> 41:06.840\n It's just basic fear.\n\n41:06.840 --> 41:08.920\n It's the same kind of fear that if you see a,\n\n41:08.920 --> 41:11.680\n if you're a guy, see a cute girl at a bar,\n\n41:11.680 --> 41:14.480\n it's the fear associated with coming up to her,\n\n41:14.480 --> 41:15.840\n you like her, asking her.\n\n41:15.840 --> 41:18.160\n It's like, what's the actual risk exactly?\n\n41:18.160 --> 41:19.320\n Right.\n\n41:19.320 --> 41:20.800\n She'll say, no thanks, I'm not interested.\n\n41:20.800 --> 41:21.640\n No thanks.\n\n41:21.640 --> 41:23.380\n I guess the risk is like,\n\n41:23.380 --> 41:26.040\n that's going to be mentally difficult\n\n41:26.040 --> 41:27.680\n to deal with rejection.\n\n41:27.680 --> 41:31.040\n So just like it's mentally difficult to deal with failure.\n\n41:31.040 --> 41:33.800\n If you had a bunch of ideas and you were excited about them\n\n41:33.800 --> 41:37.160\n and you implement them and you realize they're not good,\n\n41:37.160 --> 41:40.360\n that could be difficult to keep pushing through that.\n\n41:40.360 --> 41:41.880\n But I suppose that's life.\n\n41:41.880 --> 41:44.200\n You're supposed to, you know,\n\n41:44.200 --> 41:48.080\n perseverance through the failures and then the risk is low.\n\n41:48.080 --> 41:50.120\n So that's, and then the whole time through the fog\n\n41:50.120 --> 41:52.360\n up the mountain, you're looking for product market fit.\n\n41:52.360 --> 41:53.360\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n41:53.360 --> 41:55.620\n So you know, you have it when the usage of your product\n\n41:55.620 --> 41:57.400\n keeps growing without any marketing dollars\n\n41:57.400 --> 41:58.240\n or anything like that.\n\n41:58.240 --> 41:59.680\n It's just like more people keep coming back\n\n41:59.680 --> 42:01.180\n every week or month.\n\n42:01.180 --> 42:02.020\n So you're kind of keep,\n\n42:02.020 --> 42:04.400\n you're basically watching your stats.\n\n42:04.400 --> 42:05.840\n Nothing is working.\n\n42:05.840 --> 42:09.360\n You see these little wiggles of false hope in your metrics\n\n42:09.360 --> 42:11.380\n and you basically just keep talking to customers,\n\n42:11.380 --> 42:12.680\n fixing the, improving the product,\n\n42:12.680 --> 42:13.880\n talk to customers, improve the product,\n\n42:13.880 --> 42:16.280\n talk to customers, improve product, you know,\n\n42:16.280 --> 42:17.120\n and try not to run out of money.\n\n42:17.120 --> 42:18.200\n So be really scrappy.\n\n42:19.280 --> 42:22.320\n And then if you're lucky, you hit some kind of threshold\n\n42:22.320 --> 42:24.060\n where like, okay, the thing is good enough now,\n\n42:24.060 --> 42:26.760\n or we hit on some use case and then it'll organically\n\n42:26.760 --> 42:28.340\n start to grow a bit.\n\n42:28.340 --> 42:30.740\n And then you have a whole different set of problems\n\n42:30.740 --> 42:31.680\n once you hit product market fit,\n\n42:31.680 --> 42:34.220\n which is how do we scale this thing?\n\n42:34.220 --> 42:35.720\n How do we hire people?\n\n42:35.720 --> 42:39.120\n How do we, you know, hire an executive team\n\n42:39.120 --> 42:39.960\n or raise more money?\n\n42:39.960 --> 42:42.760\n And like, so the problems totally change, but yeah.\n\n42:42.760 --> 42:45.080\n Well, you were there through the whole thing.\n\n42:45.080 --> 42:48.120\n So that's the other question that's fascinating.\n\n42:48.120 --> 42:50.960\n Again, back to the girl at the bar,\n\n42:50.960 --> 42:52.240\n how do you hire people?\n\n42:52.240 --> 42:55.360\n It's like, how do you find good friends?\n\n42:55.360 --> 42:57.800\n How do you find good relationships?\n\n42:57.800 --> 43:01.100\n And in this specific case, how do you hire good people?\n\n43:01.100 --> 43:04.940\n Engineers, executive, all of it.\n\n43:04.940 --> 43:06.720\n One thing is I've done a lot of reps on hiring\n\n43:06.720 --> 43:07.560\n at this point.\n\n43:07.560 --> 43:10.700\n So Coinbase has about 5,000 people,\n\n43:12.040 --> 43:14.440\n probably the first 500 people or something,\n\n43:14.440 --> 43:16.020\n maybe in that range.\n\n43:16.020 --> 43:18.200\n You know, I interviewed every single one of those,\n\n43:18.200 --> 43:20.780\n but you have to remember there's probably like,\n\n43:20.780 --> 43:22.520\n I don't know, on average, maybe 10 people\n\n43:22.520 --> 43:25.040\n that we went in the process for every one we hired\n\n43:25.040 --> 43:25.860\n or something.\n\n43:25.860 --> 43:29.360\n So it was like, by the time that we had 500 employees,\n\n43:29.360 --> 43:31.280\n I had done like 5,000 interviews or something.\n\n43:31.280 --> 43:32.880\n I was like very burned out on interviews.\n\n43:32.880 --> 43:36.400\n I had been doing, some days I did like seven interviews\n\n43:36.400 --> 43:39.320\n in a day or maybe, you know, you've been doing\n\n43:39.320 --> 43:40.720\n lots of interviews, maybe you wouldn't get burned out,\n\n43:40.720 --> 43:42.480\n but different kind of interviews.\n\n43:42.480 --> 43:45.000\n Very different, very different, very different,\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:49.200\n because you're, so first of all,\n\n43:49.200 --> 43:51.440\n most of your interviews lead to rejection.\n\n43:51.440 --> 43:52.560\n Yeah.\n\n43:52.560 --> 43:54.760\n Which is also exhausting.\n\n43:54.760 --> 43:57.440\n Yeah, and there's a whole part of the interview\n\n43:57.440 --> 43:59.160\n which is about candidate experience, right?\n\n43:59.160 --> 44:00.880\n Sometimes you know it's not the right person,\n\n44:00.880 --> 44:02.440\n but you wanna make sure they have a good experience.\n\n44:02.440 --> 44:03.280\n Yes.\n\n44:03.280 --> 44:04.120\n Like, if you're just exhausted\n\n44:04.120 --> 44:05.080\n and you're on your sixth interview\n\n44:05.080 --> 44:06.840\n and you're like, well, thanks for coming in\n\n44:06.840 --> 44:08.600\n and you wrap and you just, and then like,\n\n44:08.600 --> 44:09.840\n you're gonna create a detractor.\n\n44:09.840 --> 44:11.400\n Someone who's out there like, fuck that company\n\n44:11.400 --> 44:12.680\n or Brian was rude to me or whatever.\n\n44:12.680 --> 44:15.080\n So I had to, honestly, I had to work on that a little bit\n\n44:15.080 --> 44:16.680\n in the early days because I was doing so many interviews.\n\n44:16.680 --> 44:20.040\n Like I needed to make sure that when people came in,\n\n44:20.040 --> 44:22.580\n I was like, you know, made them feel comfortable,\n\n44:23.560 --> 44:25.280\n asked them a couple of like warmup questions,\n\n44:25.280 --> 44:27.040\n just like, oh, how was it getting in the office?\n\n44:27.040 --> 44:27.960\n Like, did you find it okay?\n\n44:27.960 --> 44:29.220\n And like, what have you been up to this week?\n\n44:29.220 --> 44:32.760\n And not just like, you know, like a factory assembly line\n\n44:32.760 --> 44:34.880\n like boom, boom, boom, like, yeah.\n\n44:34.880 --> 44:35.840\n But also there's a moment,\n\n44:35.840 --> 44:37.040\n cause I've interviewed a bunch of people\n\n44:37.040 --> 44:38.680\n for like teams and stuff.\n\n44:38.680 --> 44:40.600\n There's also a moment when you, early on,\n\n44:40.600 --> 44:42.720\n know it's not gonna be a good fit\n\n44:42.720 --> 44:45.000\n and you still have to land that plane\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:46.840\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n44:46.840 --> 44:49.340\n And that could get really, really, really exhausting.\n\n44:49.340 --> 44:50.360\n So yeah, anyway, sorry.\n\n44:50.360 --> 44:51.520\n So.\n\n44:51.520 --> 44:53.280\n Yeah, so basically we tried all,\n\n44:53.280 --> 44:54.400\n we've tried so many things over the years\n\n44:54.400 --> 44:55.640\n to make interviews more efficient\n\n44:55.640 --> 44:58.860\n cause it's a huge time sink for the team.\n\n44:58.860 --> 45:00.720\n So, you know, we basically,\n\n45:00.720 --> 45:03.320\n we'll usually get them down to like 25 minutes.\n\n45:03.320 --> 45:05.880\n I've seen, if you're trying to hire like a big team,\n\n45:05.880 --> 45:08.480\n let's say, you know,\n\n45:08.480 --> 45:10.140\n of people who are like contractors or something,\n\n45:10.140 --> 45:11.280\n not necessarily full time employees.\n\n45:11.280 --> 45:14.280\n I've seen people actually do 10 minute interviews.\n\n45:14.280 --> 45:16.400\n You can even interview like a thousand people\n\n45:16.400 --> 45:17.760\n almost like in a week or something.\n\n45:17.760 --> 45:18.920\n I'm not sure if that quite works out,\n\n45:18.920 --> 45:20.860\n but let me a little less than that.\n\n45:20.860 --> 45:23.680\n But you can basically get six and six done in an hour.\n\n45:23.680 --> 45:25.880\n If you're just, I need to get a team of 30 contractors\n\n45:25.880 --> 45:26.720\n for whatever purpose.\n\n45:26.720 --> 45:28.480\n But if you're talking about full time employees,\n\n45:28.480 --> 45:30.760\n I usually do like 25 minute.\n\n45:30.760 --> 45:32.880\n You know, you're oftentimes like,\n\n45:32.880 --> 45:37.320\n one thing we've done is we'll put like a Google form online\n\n45:37.320 --> 45:39.560\n and it's like, put some basic hurdles in there.\n\n45:39.560 --> 45:43.160\n Like, you know, ask them to put in an answer,\n\n45:43.160 --> 45:44.260\n which you can check in a spreadsheet\n\n45:44.260 --> 45:45.200\n if it was correct or not.\n\n45:45.200 --> 45:46.760\n And like, there was some funny examples\n\n45:46.760 --> 45:47.600\n in the early days of Coinbase\n\n45:47.600 --> 45:49.280\n where we'd put in like brain teasers and stuff,\n\n45:49.280 --> 45:50.480\n but we don't do that anymore.\n\n45:50.480 --> 45:52.640\n We do like normal interviews, we do references.\n\n45:52.640 --> 45:54.640\n The kinds of things I ask in interviews,\n\n45:56.140 --> 45:57.840\n you know, it's usually like,\n\n45:57.840 --> 46:00.380\n I like to think about what do we need this person\n\n46:00.380 --> 46:03.000\n to accomplish in this role, right?\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.300\n And get really specific about that.\n\n46:05.300 --> 46:07.200\n It's like usually something pretty hard.\n\n46:07.200 --> 46:08.540\n And then I'll ask them a question.\n\n46:08.540 --> 46:11.360\n It's like, tell me about a time you did X\n\n46:11.360 --> 46:14.580\n and, or tell me about the hardest,\n\n46:14.580 --> 46:17.400\n the hardest kind of problem you've had to solve in Y\n\n46:17.400 --> 46:20.360\n and what did you do specifically to overcome it, right?\n\n46:20.360 --> 46:22.400\n So I'm asking to see if they can actually do the stuff\n\n46:22.400 --> 46:23.240\n we need to get done.\n\n46:23.240 --> 46:25.860\n But then I'm also kind of asking like culture questions\n\n46:25.860 --> 46:27.440\n if I'm interviewing for that.\n\n46:27.440 --> 46:29.400\n And so I'm trying to see like,\n\n46:29.400 --> 46:30.840\n are they concise communicators?\n\n46:30.840 --> 46:34.440\n Can they just give me a clear answer and stop talking?\n\n46:34.440 --> 46:37.200\n Some people like ramble on for like five, 10 minutes\n\n46:37.200 --> 46:38.720\n if you ask the first question.\n\n46:38.720 --> 46:41.220\n Some people are, you know, they're interrupters\n\n46:41.220 --> 46:42.160\n like church of interruption.\n\n46:42.160 --> 46:44.840\n So like they won't stop talking until you interrupt them,\n\n46:44.840 --> 46:46.780\n which for me, I'm always patient and I wait.\n\n46:46.780 --> 46:48.220\n So that's weird.\n\n46:49.380 --> 46:50.900\n I'm looking to see for humility too.\n\n46:50.900 --> 46:53.360\n Like, you know, I'll tell us people,\n\n46:53.360 --> 46:55.420\n I'll tell you about a time something went really wrong.\n\n46:55.420 --> 46:57.080\n Like you had conflict with someone on a team\n\n46:57.080 --> 47:00.200\n or what I'm kind of looking for is,\n\n47:00.200 --> 47:01.320\n were they part of the solution\n\n47:01.320 --> 47:03.780\n or are they still holding onto like blame and criticism\n\n47:03.780 --> 47:04.620\n about that and be like,\n\n47:04.620 --> 47:06.360\n well, I told them they shouldn't do that way,\n\n47:06.360 --> 47:07.360\n but they didn't listen to me.\n\n47:07.360 --> 47:09.440\n And you know, these are all like bad signs.\n\n47:09.440 --> 47:11.960\n So I'm looking for, yeah, can they get the job done?\n\n47:11.960 --> 47:13.600\n Will they work together on a team?\n\n47:13.600 --> 47:15.800\n Can they communicate effectively?\n\n47:15.800 --> 47:18.280\n Do they fit into our cultural values and you know,\n\n47:18.280 --> 47:19.120\n those kinds of things.\n\n47:19.120 --> 47:20.220\n Yeah, I mean, there's a,\n\n47:20.220 --> 47:24.420\n cause I've even for help with this podcast here,\n\n47:24.420 --> 47:27.420\n but also at MIT and so on, I've done a bunch of hiring\n\n47:27.420 --> 47:30.360\n and I was always looking for, you said, brain teasers,\n\n47:30.360 --> 47:33.080\n all kinds of simple questions that can,\n\n47:33.080 --> 47:35.600\n they can reveal a lot of information\n\n47:35.600 --> 47:36.860\n and it's always been challenging.\n\n47:36.860 --> 47:39.060\n I used to, I still ask this question,\n\n47:39.060 --> 47:43.820\n but do you think it's better to work hard or work smart?\n\n47:45.580 --> 47:50.320\n And you know, I had this idea that I've,\n\n47:50.320 --> 47:54.900\n that I think I've matured about,\n\n47:54.900 --> 47:59.060\n which is I kind of believe that people who say work smart\n\n47:59.060 --> 48:03.300\n on that question don't actually work smart.\n\n48:03.300 --> 48:07.880\n So the right textbook answer is it's better to work smart.\n\n48:07.880 --> 48:12.140\n But the reality is it's people that haven't actually\n\n48:12.140 --> 48:14.980\n ever done anything that say work smart.\n\n48:14.980 --> 48:17.860\n They're like, they haven't really struggled\n\n48:17.860 --> 48:20.640\n because my general belief at the time\n\n48:20.640 --> 48:25.640\n was in order to discover what it means to work smart,\n\n48:25.780 --> 48:29.060\n to be efficient, to, you have to work your ass off.\n\n48:29.060 --> 48:30.940\n So you have to really fail a lot\n\n48:30.940 --> 48:33.460\n and failure feels like hard work.\n\n48:33.460 --> 48:36.380\n And so I was always suspicious of people\n\n48:36.380 --> 48:37.860\n that would say work smart.\n\n48:37.860 --> 48:40.520\n I would want to interrogate that question.\n\n48:41.380 --> 48:45.540\n But then I also, you know, have learned that there is people\n\n48:45.540 --> 48:50.540\n that are just exceptionally, exceptionally efficient.\n\n48:51.340 --> 48:53.860\n They really do know what it means to work smart,\n\n48:53.860 --> 48:55.700\n even at a young age.\n\n48:55.700 --> 48:58.500\n And so like, you can't just disqualify based on that.\n\n48:58.500 --> 49:00.340\n You have to dig in deeper.\n\n49:00.340 --> 49:02.780\n But some of the most interesting people I've ever worked\n\n49:02.780 --> 49:05.020\n with would say work hard unapologetically.\n\n49:05.020 --> 49:08.580\n And they're usually the ones that know how to be efficient,\n\n49:08.580 --> 49:11.220\n which is, it's just an interesting thing like that.\n\n49:11.220 --> 49:13.940\n And I've always searched for questions of that nature\n\n49:13.940 --> 49:18.940\n to see can I get a person to reveal something profound\n\n49:21.220 --> 49:25.580\n about them in as brief of a question as possible?\n\n49:26.940 --> 49:28.540\n And I, you know, and then of course,\n\n49:28.540 --> 49:31.500\n there's basic attention to detail and brain teasers\n\n49:31.500 --> 49:33.380\n and stuff like that, depending on the role,\n\n49:33.380 --> 49:38.060\n programming and so on to see can they solve a tricky puzzle\n\n49:38.060 --> 49:40.960\n and do so, like one that doesn't require a lot of effort,\n\n49:40.960 --> 49:45.960\n but requires a certain nonlinear way of thinking.\n\n49:46.300 --> 49:49.800\n Is there some, I mean, maybe you don't want to reveal,\n\n49:49.800 --> 49:52.740\n but is there some questions that you sometimes\n\n49:52.740 --> 49:55.020\n find yourself leaning on?\n\n49:55.020 --> 49:58.140\n You said like, how did you solve a hard problem\n\n49:58.140 --> 50:01.380\n in your past and have them talk through it?\n\n50:01.380 --> 50:02.220\n That's one.\n\n50:02.220 --> 50:04.780\n You know, we started with brain teasers periodically\n\n50:04.780 --> 50:07.700\n at Coinbase and we got away from that relatively quickly.\n\n50:07.700 --> 50:10.860\n And I think one, it's a tough one\n\n50:10.860 --> 50:15.180\n because I actually think it does show how somebody\n\n50:15.180 --> 50:16.420\n kind of performs under pressure,\n\n50:16.420 --> 50:18.680\n but it's, I don't think it's a super reliable indicator\n\n50:18.680 --> 50:22.420\n because there's some people who are really good\n\n50:22.420 --> 50:25.180\n in the typical work situation,\n\n50:25.180 --> 50:26.460\n but that's not a typical work situation\n\n50:26.460 --> 50:27.620\n where somebody puts you on the spot,\n\n50:27.620 --> 50:29.920\n like in a live interview and sometimes people get nervous\n\n50:29.920 --> 50:31.020\n and they can't think clearly\n\n50:31.020 --> 50:32.700\n and like they don't have their computer in front of them\n\n50:32.700 --> 50:34.520\n or whatever they normally use.\n\n50:35.700 --> 50:39.220\n So yeah, I'm a little skeptical now\n\n50:39.220 --> 50:41.060\n of the brain teaser thing.\n\n50:42.340 --> 50:46.380\n There is a whole, yeah, there is a whole question about,\n\n50:46.380 --> 50:48.100\n like a lot of universities are getting rid of,\n\n50:48.100 --> 50:48.980\n you know, entrance exams.\n\n50:48.980 --> 50:51.340\n So if you're hiring right out of universities,\n\n50:52.680 --> 50:54.700\n sometimes it's becoming a less reliable indicator\n\n50:54.700 --> 50:56.560\n of like, are they in that university?\n\n50:56.560 --> 50:58.500\n And I've heard some companies, we haven't done this yet,\n\n50:58.500 --> 50:59.780\n but I've heard some companies are actually creating\n\n50:59.780 --> 51:01.660\n their own like for college grads,\n\n51:01.660 --> 51:06.660\n like their own basically exams, like standardized testing\n\n51:06.700 --> 51:08.140\n almost to get people in the door\n\n51:08.140 --> 51:10.380\n because the degree almost like doesn't mean\n\n51:10.380 --> 51:12.820\n what it used to, which is the whole topic, but.\n\n51:12.820 --> 51:17.140\n Yeah, that's fascinating because it's fascinating both\n\n51:17.140 --> 51:19.380\n for that, because it's not just about you trying\n\n51:19.380 --> 51:22.300\n to hire a great team, it's also to help them find\n\n51:22.300 --> 51:23.420\n the right place to work at.\n\n51:23.420 --> 51:24.260\n Yeah.\n\n51:24.260 --> 51:25.980\n It's like a two way street.\n\n51:28.140 --> 51:32.180\n All right, so once you found the product market fit,\n\n51:32.180 --> 51:37.180\n how did Coinbase become what it is today?\n\n51:38.180 --> 51:39.020\n Ooh.\n\n51:39.020 --> 51:42.180\n So let me ask an engineering question actually.\n\n51:42.180 --> 51:47.180\n Sort of from the Ruby wallet days,\n\n51:47.540 --> 51:50.420\n what are some of the interesting challenges there?\n\n51:50.420 --> 51:52.340\n Or are they not engineering?\n\n51:52.340 --> 51:56.540\n Just the things that had to be solved, what were they?\n\n51:56.540 --> 51:59.100\n Engineering, regulation,\n\n51:59.100 --> 52:04.100\n financial hiring, lawyers, what was it?\n\n52:07.700 --> 52:10.580\n So post product market fit, yeah, a lot of it's scaling\n\n52:10.580 --> 52:12.420\n and you got to build out an actual company.\n\n52:12.420 --> 52:15.500\n So I remember I was still writing a lot of code there\n\n52:15.500 --> 52:17.220\n for a while and we were hiring in,\n\n52:17.220 --> 52:19.420\n we had like maybe 25 people or something.\n\n52:19.420 --> 52:21.060\n I remember one of our investors came by one day\n\n52:21.060 --> 52:22.860\n and he was like, Brian, how much of your time\n\n52:22.860 --> 52:24.340\n are you spending writing code?\n\n52:24.340 --> 52:27.260\n And I was like, maybe 50% or something.\n\n52:27.260 --> 52:29.660\n And he was like, how much time are you spending hiring people?\n\n52:29.660 --> 52:31.980\n I was like, probably 20%.\n\n52:31.980 --> 52:35.220\n And he was like, I think you need to flip those numbers.\n\n52:35.220 --> 52:36.740\n Like this company is not going to scale.\n\n52:36.740 --> 52:39.420\n You're the CEO, you don't need to be writing code every day.\n\n52:39.420 --> 52:40.820\n You're going to have to transition that stuff.\n\n52:40.820 --> 52:41.940\n Like even if people can't,\n\n52:41.940 --> 52:43.180\n all that stuff's locked in your head.\n\n52:43.180 --> 52:44.740\n So maybe they're not going to do it as well as you\n\n52:44.740 --> 52:46.580\n for the first six months or something.\n\n52:46.580 --> 52:48.380\n But like, if you don't start to transition it,\n\n52:48.380 --> 52:49.740\n you're never going to build a real company.\n\n52:49.740 --> 52:52.620\n It's just going to be, you're going to be the bottleneck.\n\n52:52.620 --> 52:55.860\n So, you know, like a lot of founders that took me a while\n\n52:55.860 --> 52:57.260\n to like really internalize that lesson.\n\n52:57.260 --> 52:59.780\n I'd always heard people say that and, you know,\n\n52:59.780 --> 53:02.900\n but I still was holding on too much to decision making.\n\n53:02.900 --> 53:04.100\n And I probably still am, by the way,\n\n53:04.100 --> 53:05.380\n like even to this day at Coinbase,\n\n53:05.380 --> 53:08.580\n where we continually have to push down decision making\n\n53:08.580 --> 53:10.700\n in the org, like even with 5,000 people,\n\n53:10.700 --> 53:12.260\n like who are the owners of each of these things?\n\n53:12.260 --> 53:14.180\n And so the temptation is people to push it up\n\n53:14.180 --> 53:15.060\n and you become a bottleneck.\n\n53:15.060 --> 53:19.020\n And anyway, so yeah, you basically need to make sure\n\n53:19.020 --> 53:21.180\n you have enough money where you don't die\n\n53:21.180 --> 53:23.220\n if there's some kind of a downturn\n\n53:23.220 --> 53:24.980\n or hit break even profitability.\n\n53:24.980 --> 53:27.700\n We were in a position where we were periodically profitable\n\n53:27.700 --> 53:29.300\n during up periods, but then crypto would go down\n\n53:29.300 --> 53:30.620\n and we were unprofitable.\n\n53:30.620 --> 53:33.300\n And so we had to kind of manage our own psychology\n\n53:33.300 --> 53:35.940\n and the balance sheet to make sure we didn't like die\n\n53:35.940 --> 53:38.980\n in the downturn, which a lot of crypto companies did.\n\n53:38.980 --> 53:41.060\n We had to basically professionalize a whole bunch\n\n53:41.060 --> 53:44.020\n of services that had been just very quickly thrown together\n\n53:44.020 --> 53:46.060\n by like 20 year olds, right?\n\n53:46.060 --> 53:47.900\n Whether that was cybersecurity, it's like, okay,\n\n53:47.900 --> 53:50.380\n how do you get like a really senior experienced\n\n53:50.380 --> 53:52.420\n cybersecurity person, but not someone who's so senior\n\n53:52.420 --> 53:53.500\n that they can't get their hands dirty\n\n53:53.500 --> 53:56.380\n and they can come into a company with 25, 50 people.\n\n53:56.380 --> 53:58.140\n How do you get a finance person to come in and do that?\n\n53:58.140 --> 54:00.060\n Our finances were a mess.\n\n54:00.060 --> 54:01.900\n Like we didn't even really know how much money we had\n\n54:01.900 --> 54:03.020\n at certain times and stuff.\n\n54:03.020 --> 54:04.900\n I mean, this was, it's embarrassing to say,\n\n54:04.900 --> 54:05.740\n but it was true.\n\n54:05.740 --> 54:09.700\n Like I remember there was a point where we had raised,\n\n54:09.700 --> 54:12.060\n I think like our series C or something like that.\n\n54:12.060 --> 54:14.940\n And I think we had our bank accounts.\n\n54:14.940 --> 54:17.100\n I just put like $25 million, like in a different bank\n\n54:17.100 --> 54:19.020\n account that none of this stuff was touched\n\n54:19.020 --> 54:20.140\n to the actual operations of business.\n\n54:20.140 --> 54:23.620\n Cause I was like, our operations were so messy\n\n54:23.620 --> 54:25.380\n and we needed to hire a new finance person.\n\n54:25.380 --> 54:28.340\n And I was like, I'd heard horror stories\n\n54:28.340 --> 54:29.540\n of actually startups where they thought\n\n54:29.540 --> 54:31.420\n they had X amount of money.\n\n54:31.420 --> 54:33.080\n And then it turned out they had way less.\n\n54:33.080 --> 54:35.180\n And then the whole thing was insolvent in like three weeks.\n\n54:35.180 --> 54:37.260\n So you wanted to have some padding to at least like,\n\n54:37.260 --> 54:39.800\n all right, I can at least count on this to save us\n\n54:39.800 --> 54:41.460\n if we go to like super negative.\n\n54:41.460 --> 54:43.580\n Right, I mean, it was like a cheap hack,\n\n54:43.580 --> 54:46.060\n but that was like the only I could come up with.\n\n54:46.060 --> 54:49.660\n And until we could hire like a real CFO and finance team\n\n54:49.660 --> 54:52.000\n who like, okay, now we got our arms around\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:52.840\n how much cash we have.\n\n54:52.840 --> 54:55.620\n It sounds silly, but we had such high volume\n\n54:55.620 --> 54:56.620\n of money coming in and out.\n\n54:56.620 --> 54:57.460\n Anyway.\n\n54:57.460 --> 54:59.840\n What was the ordering of hiring by the way?\n\n54:59.840 --> 55:03.420\n Like how many engineers was it early on?\n\n55:03.420 --> 55:06.980\n You said CFO was not, you didn't even have a CFO for a bit.\n\n55:06.980 --> 55:10.860\n Like what was the landscape of hiring\n\n55:10.860 --> 55:12.480\n as you building up this company?\n\n55:13.380 --> 55:15.260\n Was it engineering focused?\n\n55:15.260 --> 55:16.100\n Well, let's see.\n\n55:16.100 --> 55:18.540\n I mean, so the first person we hired was just like,\n\n55:18.540 --> 55:20.040\n we need to solve customer support.\n\n55:20.040 --> 55:20.980\n So we brought someone to do that\n\n55:20.980 --> 55:22.500\n because we were all staying up till midnight every night\n\n55:22.500 --> 55:23.840\n trying to do customer support.\n\n55:23.840 --> 55:26.420\n And then we got more engineers.\n\n55:26.420 --> 55:27.980\n And then I think maybe the sixth hire\n\n55:27.980 --> 55:29.540\n or something like that was a recruiter.\n\n55:29.540 --> 55:31.980\n Cause that turned out to be, you need to build,\n\n55:31.980 --> 55:34.340\n hire the person who can hire more people.\n\n55:34.340 --> 55:37.180\n That turned out to be a great force multiplier.\n\n55:37.180 --> 55:39.780\n And then you're going down the list.\n\n55:39.780 --> 55:42.520\n Eventually you want to hire some more senior people.\n\n55:43.640 --> 55:45.220\n We needed legal and compliance.\n\n55:45.220 --> 55:46.460\n We needed that really badly.\n\n55:46.460 --> 55:48.540\n Cause we, it was all kinds of questions about\n\n55:48.540 --> 55:50.400\n what the legality of it was.\n\n55:50.400 --> 55:52.740\n Was it hard to find legal people that work with crypto,\n\n55:52.740 --> 55:54.940\n like serious adults?\n\n55:54.940 --> 55:57.540\n Cause it's such a cutting edge new world.\n\n55:57.540 --> 56:01.100\n Yeah, I mean, there was nobody who had like more than,\n\n56:01.100 --> 56:02.380\n nobody had three years of experience with it\n\n56:02.380 --> 56:04.180\n cause it had only been around a few years.\n\n56:04.180 --> 56:07.180\n So yeah, we were finding people from adjacent fields.\n\n56:07.180 --> 56:08.860\n There's a certain personality type of people\n\n56:08.860 --> 56:10.420\n who are willing to join early companies\n\n56:10.420 --> 56:12.500\n because they have no structure.\n\n56:12.500 --> 56:14.100\n You can't really commit to them about\n\n56:14.100 --> 56:16.620\n you're going to have this team or this boss or whatever.\n\n56:16.620 --> 56:18.920\n Like everything's in chaos and flux.\n\n56:18.920 --> 56:22.340\n So it takes, yeah, hiring is one of the hardest things\n\n56:22.340 --> 56:23.220\n in the early stage for sure.\n\n56:23.220 --> 56:24.620\n You got to find people crazy enough\n\n56:24.620 --> 56:26.240\n to join you on this journey.\n\n56:26.240 --> 56:28.180\n So one of the interesting things about Coinbase\n\n56:28.180 --> 56:31.340\n and you've written, we've talked, we'll talk about it a bit.\n\n56:31.340 --> 56:33.540\n You're very focused on the mission.\n\n56:33.540 --> 56:34.380\n Yeah.\n\n56:34.380 --> 56:37.980\n You're very kind of, I think that simplifies things\n\n56:37.980 --> 56:40.700\n that makes hiring easier,\n\n56:40.700 --> 56:42.820\n that makes working at Coinbase easier,\n\n56:42.820 --> 56:44.980\n that makes, I mean, it's similar.\n\n56:44.980 --> 56:46.780\n So Elon has the same thing.\n\n56:46.780 --> 56:47.740\n It's pretty clear.\n\n56:47.740 --> 56:50.460\n It's pretty clear what we're here to do.\n\n56:50.460 --> 56:55.460\n So I suppose what's the mission of Coinbase?\n\n56:55.540 --> 56:57.860\n Well, it's to increase economic freedom in the world.\n\n56:57.860 --> 56:59.940\n And what is economic freedom?\n\n56:59.940 --> 57:02.660\n Yeah, so economic freedom is this term kind of like GDP\n\n57:02.660 --> 57:04.060\n that economists use.\n\n57:04.060 --> 57:05.820\n And it's basically a measure of different countries\n\n57:05.820 --> 57:06.660\n around the world.\n\n57:06.660 --> 57:07.660\n It looks at things like,\n\n57:07.660 --> 57:09.700\n are there property rights enforced?\n\n57:09.700 --> 57:10.780\n Is there free trade?\n\n57:10.780 --> 57:12.520\n Is the currency stable?\n\n57:12.520 --> 57:14.100\n Can you start companies that you wanna start?\n\n57:14.100 --> 57:15.340\n And can you join the ones you wanna join?\n\n57:15.340 --> 57:18.620\n And is there corruption and bribery prevalent\n\n57:18.620 --> 57:20.700\n or is it relatively free of that?\n\n57:20.700 --> 57:24.280\n And so there's several different organizations\n\n57:24.280 --> 57:27.220\n that basically score countries by economic freedom.\n\n57:27.220 --> 57:28.840\n And the really cool thing about economic freedom\n\n57:28.840 --> 57:31.740\n is that basically it positively correlates\n\n57:31.740 --> 57:33.340\n with things that we all want in society,\n\n57:33.340 --> 57:36.620\n like not only higher growth of the economy,\n\n57:36.620 --> 57:39.340\n but also things like higher self reported happiness\n\n57:39.340 --> 57:41.780\n of citizens, better treatment of the environment,\n\n57:41.780 --> 57:44.360\n better income for the poorest 10% of people.\n\n57:44.360 --> 57:45.860\n And it negatively correlates with things\n\n57:45.860 --> 57:46.780\n we don't want in society,\n\n57:46.780 --> 57:48.980\n like corruption and bribery and war,\n\n57:48.980 --> 57:50.500\n even in things like that.\n\n57:50.500 --> 57:53.980\n And so it's this pretty crazy provocative idea,\n\n57:53.980 --> 57:58.580\n which is that if you give people good property rights\n\n57:58.580 --> 58:01.160\n and rule of law and allow them to trade,\n\n58:01.160 --> 58:03.380\n it basically encourages them to do more good stuff\n\n58:03.380 --> 58:05.240\n and the whole society benefits.\n\n58:05.240 --> 58:08.320\n Like one of the things, you may have noticed this\n\n58:08.320 --> 58:09.660\n growing up in various places you did,\n\n58:09.660 --> 58:12.220\n or I spent a year living in Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n58:12.220 --> 58:13.340\n that went through hyperinflation.\n\n58:13.340 --> 58:15.820\n And there's a certain like pessimism\n\n58:15.820 --> 58:18.520\n that can creep into countries\n\n58:18.520 --> 58:21.040\n when they don't have economic freedom,\n\n58:21.040 --> 58:24.020\n which it's basically like everyone has this bit of this vibe,\n\n58:24.020 --> 58:26.620\n which is like, don't stick your head up,\n\n58:26.620 --> 58:28.960\n don't try too hard because it could all be gone tomorrow.\n\n58:28.960 --> 58:30.900\n Like the things that really are valuable in life\n\n58:30.900 --> 58:32.540\n are just family and friends\n\n58:32.540 --> 58:35.440\n and the past was better than the future will be.\n\n58:35.440 --> 58:37.580\n And so you don't really, people don't try as many,\n\n58:37.580 --> 58:40.240\n they don't try hard because you're not really sure\n\n58:40.240 --> 58:42.080\n you can actually keep the upside of your labor\n\n58:42.080 --> 58:44.840\n if you try hard, so you just don't try as hard.\n\n58:44.840 --> 58:47.700\n Whereas in America, historically,\n\n58:47.700 --> 58:49.540\n or high economic freedom countries,\n\n58:51.060 --> 58:53.720\n people basically like they just try more stuff\n\n58:53.720 --> 58:55.520\n because they're like, if I do good for other people,\n\n58:55.520 --> 58:56.800\n I'll get to keep part of it for myself\n\n58:56.800 --> 58:58.100\n and I can improve my lot in life\n\n58:58.100 --> 59:00.560\n and for my children and my community, whatever.\n\n59:00.560 --> 59:03.700\n So I realized when I read the Bitcoin white paper\n\n59:03.700 --> 59:06.700\n a long time ago, that at least I had a hunch.\n\n59:06.700 --> 59:07.760\n At the time I was like,\n\n59:07.760 --> 59:09.920\n this might be a really powerful piece of technology\n\n59:09.920 --> 59:13.640\n that can inject good financial infrastructure\n\n59:13.640 --> 59:15.940\n into all these countries around the world that don't have it.\n\n59:15.940 --> 59:18.020\n Basically good economic freedom principles\n\n59:18.020 --> 59:20.700\n in like property rights and things like that\n\n59:20.700 --> 59:22.180\n into these countries all over the world,\n\n59:22.180 --> 59:23.620\n which just as long as you had a smartphone\n\n59:23.620 --> 59:25.140\n and now crypto got invented,\n\n59:25.140 --> 59:27.260\n everybody could have economic freedom.\n\n59:27.260 --> 59:28.960\n And it's crypto is kind of really well suited\n\n59:28.960 --> 59:29.800\n for economic freedom,\n\n59:29.800 --> 59:31.840\n because if you want property rights,\n\n59:31.840 --> 59:32.940\n it's based like crypto is,\n\n59:32.940 --> 59:34.620\n if you can remember a 12 word phrase\n\n59:34.620 --> 59:37.020\n or have an app on your phone,\n\n59:37.020 --> 59:38.620\n you can store as much wealth as you want.\n\n59:38.620 --> 59:39.780\n And it can't be taken away from you.\n\n59:39.780 --> 59:42.980\n You can even, there's like refugees who need to flee\n\n59:42.980 --> 59:44.660\n and they wanna take their wealth with them\n\n59:44.660 --> 59:46.240\n and they can't do it often\n\n59:46.240 --> 59:47.500\n in the traditional financial system.\n\n59:47.500 --> 59:49.760\n And so crypto lets them do that, right?\n\n59:49.760 --> 59:51.060\n Crypto is inherently global.\n\n59:51.060 --> 59:53.740\n So it allows free trade and cross border payments.\n\n59:54.840 --> 59:57.860\n It makes it easy to accept payments from people globally.\n\n59:57.860 --> 1:00:00.060\n It provides a stable currency to everyone,\n\n1:00:00.060 --> 1:00:00.940\n not only with Bitcoin,\n\n1:00:00.940 --> 1:00:03.080\n which is kind of like this new reserve currency,\n\n1:00:03.080 --> 1:00:05.900\n but also with stable coins, right?\n\n1:00:05.900 --> 1:00:08.220\n Which are new inventions there.\n\n1:00:08.220 --> 1:00:10.860\n So yeah, I basically feel like crypto\n\n1:00:10.860 --> 1:00:13.120\n is this secret hiding in plain sight\n\n1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:14.780\n that can create economic freedom\n\n1:00:14.780 --> 1:00:15.780\n for people all over the world\n\n1:00:15.780 --> 1:00:18.980\n and a more fair and free and global economy.\n\n1:00:18.980 --> 1:00:21.060\n Well, so the limit,\n\n1:00:21.060 --> 1:00:22.860\n and by the way, I didn't know about Argentina.\n\n1:00:22.860 --> 1:00:25.160\n Why'd you end up in Argentina?\n\n1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:26.960\n Okay, so I was basically,\n\n1:00:28.020 --> 1:00:30.180\n I was living in Houston, Texas after college\n\n1:00:30.180 --> 1:00:31.500\n where I went to school.\n\n1:00:31.500 --> 1:00:33.220\n And I had never studied abroad.\n\n1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:36.220\n I kind of like, I don't know,\n\n1:00:36.220 --> 1:00:38.140\n I felt like I needed some adventure or something in my life.\n\n1:00:38.140 --> 1:00:40.220\n And I was like, I was running this other startup\n\n1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:41.900\n that I was trying at the time, a tutoring company,\n\n1:00:41.900 --> 1:00:43.740\n and I could work from anywhere.\n\n1:00:43.740 --> 1:00:44.940\n So my plan was, you know what,\n\n1:00:44.940 --> 1:00:47.260\n I'm just gonna go do like a month\n\n1:00:47.260 --> 1:00:49.120\n in every city around South America,\n\n1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:51.260\n just like almost like to force myself\n\n1:00:51.260 --> 1:00:52.180\n out of my comfort zone\n\n1:00:52.180 --> 1:00:54.640\n because I had never traveled by myself\n\n1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:55.720\n to a foreign country or whatever,\n\n1:00:55.720 --> 1:00:57.340\n and where I didn't really speak the language.\n\n1:00:57.340 --> 1:01:00.420\n And anyway, I landed in Buenos Aires\n\n1:01:00.420 --> 1:01:01.780\n thinking I'd go all around South America\n\n1:01:01.780 --> 1:01:03.240\n where I had never been there.\n\n1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:06.600\n But I basically, once I was set up in Buenos Aires\n\n1:01:06.600 --> 1:01:08.160\n with an apartment and a cell phone and stuff,\n\n1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:10.300\n then I was like, I don't wanna do that all again next month.\n\n1:01:10.300 --> 1:01:11.620\n So I just stayed there for most of the time\n\n1:01:11.620 --> 1:01:12.460\n and took some day trips.\n\n1:01:12.460 --> 1:01:15.060\n But yeah, it was kind of a formative experience\n\n1:01:15.060 --> 1:01:15.900\n in that regard.\n\n1:01:15.900 --> 1:01:18.580\n You got a chance sort of unexpectedly\n\n1:01:18.580 --> 1:01:21.460\n to experience the social effects of hyperinflation,\n\n1:01:21.460 --> 1:01:22.500\n which is interesting.\n\n1:01:22.500 --> 1:01:24.380\n But I also, I've never been,\n\n1:01:24.380 --> 1:01:26.860\n I really, really wanna go as a person who likes tangos,\n\n1:01:26.860 --> 1:01:29.980\n a person who likes the Argentinian national team\n\n1:01:29.980 --> 1:01:34.340\n and soccer and steak.\n\n1:01:34.340 --> 1:01:36.620\n All right, and all the other things\n\n1:01:36.620 --> 1:01:38.240\n that Argentina is known for.\n\n1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:41.380\n Okay, so economic freedom.\n\n1:01:41.380 --> 1:01:43.620\n One of the limits on economic freedom\n\n1:01:43.620 --> 1:01:46.300\n comes from government and government regulations\n\n1:01:46.300 --> 1:01:49.360\n and all those kinds of things throughout the world.\n\n1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:52.340\n So how does cryptocurrency help resist that?\n\n1:01:52.340 --> 1:01:55.560\n So can you sort of elaborate a little bit further?\n\n1:01:55.560 --> 1:01:57.900\n What are the things that limit economic freedom\n\n1:01:57.900 --> 1:02:01.880\n and how does crypto help ease that?\n\n1:02:03.340 --> 1:02:05.420\n Today the world, like the traditional financial system\n\n1:02:05.420 --> 1:02:08.060\n is basically every country of the world for the most part\n\n1:02:08.060 --> 1:02:10.220\n has their own currency.\n\n1:02:10.220 --> 1:02:13.280\n And so there's a group of people or institutions\n\n1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:15.360\n in each of those countries that's controlling\n\n1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:18.560\n that economic policy or that money supply.\n\n1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:22.380\n And it can be manipulated, right?\n\n1:02:22.380 --> 1:02:25.100\n So it's not like many of these currencies\n\n1:02:25.100 --> 1:02:26.820\n are not linked to gold standard.\n\n1:02:26.820 --> 1:02:29.260\n The U.S. kind of famously came off that in 1970s,\n\n1:02:29.260 --> 1:02:32.020\n for instance, but if you read Ray Dalio and all this stuff\n\n1:02:32.020 --> 1:02:34.500\n like he talks about, there's thousands of fiat currencies\n\n1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:36.700\n that have been in existence over time.\n\n1:02:36.700 --> 1:02:39.660\n And basically all of them eventually get disconnected\n\n1:02:39.660 --> 1:02:43.700\n from backing of like hard commodities\n\n1:02:43.700 --> 1:02:46.460\n and then they get overinflated and printed.\n\n1:02:46.460 --> 1:02:50.980\n And so in times of stress, with Nixon,\n\n1:02:50.980 --> 1:02:53.780\n I guess it was like in the U.S. it was the Vietnam War\n\n1:02:53.780 --> 1:02:54.900\n or something like that.\n\n1:02:54.900 --> 1:02:56.340\n It kind of drove government spending.\n\n1:02:56.340 --> 1:02:57.980\n And so under times of stress, they say,\n\n1:02:57.980 --> 1:02:59.100\n hey, it's a temporary measure.\n\n1:02:59.100 --> 1:03:00.820\n We need to break the peg.\n\n1:03:00.820 --> 1:03:02.980\n Temporary was like famous words that he used\n\n1:03:02.980 --> 1:03:07.500\n and they go print.\n\n1:03:07.500 --> 1:03:09.300\n And so the bad thing about that, of course,\n\n1:03:09.300 --> 1:03:11.980\n is that it sort of erodes people's like wealth\n\n1:03:11.980 --> 1:03:13.580\n if they can only hold their assets in cash,\n\n1:03:13.580 --> 1:03:16.820\n which basically like poor people tend to do that.\n\n1:03:16.820 --> 1:03:19.220\n If you're wealthy, you can hold stocks\n\n1:03:19.220 --> 1:03:20.740\n or like real estate and things like that.\n\n1:03:20.740 --> 1:03:22.700\n But it's really a tax on the poorest people\n\n1:03:22.700 --> 1:03:24.760\n in society, inflation.\n\n1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:28.060\n So anyway, crypto in a way is a little bit\n\n1:03:28.060 --> 1:03:30.260\n of like a return to the gold standard\n\n1:03:30.260 --> 1:03:31.620\n in this digital era, right?\n\n1:03:31.620 --> 1:03:33.820\n Bitcoin, there's guaranteed scarcity of it.\n\n1:03:33.820 --> 1:03:34.940\n It's deflationary.\n\n1:03:34.940 --> 1:03:37.420\n There's never gonna be more than 21 million Bitcoin.\n\n1:03:37.420 --> 1:03:40.760\n And so that's a really important principle.\n\n1:03:42.300 --> 1:03:44.300\n I also think not just Bitcoin,\n\n1:03:44.300 --> 1:03:46.100\n but like cryptocurrency generally,\n\n1:03:46.980 --> 1:03:48.980\n it's really important in terms of this,\n\n1:03:48.980 --> 1:03:50.740\n you asked about regulation, right?\n\n1:03:50.740 --> 1:03:55.060\n So think about like, if you wanted to make a global borrowing\n\n1:03:55.060 --> 1:03:59.140\n and lending marketplace or a global exchange,\n\n1:03:59.140 --> 1:04:01.800\n you would have to go to all 200 countries in the world,\n\n1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:03.780\n sometimes like maybe 50 states in the US\n\n1:04:03.780 --> 1:04:07.860\n and get lending licenses or an operating exchange\n\n1:04:07.860 --> 1:04:09.020\n or whatever.\n\n1:04:09.020 --> 1:04:12.900\n And that's just an incredible amount of work.\n\n1:04:12.900 --> 1:04:14.900\n And you can't even do business in many of these countries\n\n1:04:14.900 --> 1:04:17.300\n because like you have to bribe somebody\n\n1:04:17.300 --> 1:04:18.860\n or it's corrupt or whatever.\n\n1:04:18.860 --> 1:04:22.300\n And so, but with DeFi, with decentralized finance,\n\n1:04:22.300 --> 1:04:24.860\n people have published like Uniswap\n\n1:04:24.860 --> 1:04:26.300\n as a decentralized exchange.\n\n1:04:26.300 --> 1:04:28.040\n Everybody in the world, no matter what country you're in,\n\n1:04:28.040 --> 1:04:30.460\n what jurisdiction can interface\n\n1:04:30.460 --> 1:04:32.420\n with that decentralized exchange\n\n1:04:32.420 --> 1:04:35.480\n and there's no central company operating it.\n\n1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:38.620\n It's a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain,\n\n1:04:38.620 --> 1:04:40.160\n which is globally decentralized.\n\n1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:41.260\n So there's no throat to choke.\n\n1:04:41.260 --> 1:04:43.700\n There's no one person or a company you can go to\n\n1:04:43.700 --> 1:04:45.500\n to like, hey, shut this thing down.\n\n1:04:45.500 --> 1:04:48.900\n Even if everybody who's working on Uniswap today stopped,\n\n1:04:48.900 --> 1:04:52.180\n the Uniswap smart contract would continue to operate\n\n1:04:52.180 --> 1:04:53.580\n on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n1:04:54.460 --> 1:04:56.660\n Similarly for like a borrowing and lending marketplace,\n\n1:04:56.660 --> 1:05:00.860\n like somebody in India wants to borrow\n\n1:05:00.860 --> 1:05:02.380\n from somebody in the US or whatever,\n\n1:05:02.380 --> 1:05:04.260\n there's very difficult to do that\n\n1:05:04.260 --> 1:05:06.220\n in the traditional financial world,\n\n1:05:06.220 --> 1:05:08.880\n but in a smart contract that's decentralized,\n\n1:05:08.880 --> 1:05:10.660\n you can enable anybody to access it.\n\n1:05:10.660 --> 1:05:14.260\n So it's really kind of this great democratizing force\n\n1:05:14.260 --> 1:05:16.300\n that is creating a new financial system\n\n1:05:16.300 --> 1:05:17.940\n that is more fair and more free.\n\n1:05:19.380 --> 1:05:24.380\n Yeah, and in some ways it's a clever way\n\n1:05:24.700 --> 1:05:28.380\n that's enabling people to do that in a novel way.\n\n1:05:28.380 --> 1:05:32.220\n So is Uniswap in some sense a competitive Coinbase?\n\n1:05:32.220 --> 1:05:34.700\n In which way is it and which way is it not?\n\n1:05:34.700 --> 1:05:38.300\n So because for people who don't know,\n\n1:05:38.300 --> 1:05:40.660\n Coinbase is centralized.\n\n1:05:40.660 --> 1:05:45.660\n So let me ask, doesn't that go against the spirit of crypto\n\n1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:49.100\n since crypto is decentralized?\n\n1:05:49.100 --> 1:05:51.940\n What are the pros and cons of being centralized\n\n1:05:51.940 --> 1:05:53.960\n as an exchange?\n\n1:05:53.960 --> 1:05:55.980\n So I don't think Coinbase is fully centralized.\n\n1:05:55.980 --> 1:05:57.340\n We have many different products.\n\n1:05:57.340 --> 1:06:01.100\n And the way that I think about it is that our exchange\n\n1:06:01.100 --> 1:06:03.740\n or our brokerage is a centralized,\n\n1:06:03.740 --> 1:06:06.100\n regulated financial service business.\n\n1:06:06.100 --> 1:06:08.140\n And it's actually important for the crypto ecosystem\n\n1:06:08.140 --> 1:06:11.500\n to have that because you wanna allow a lot of the fiat money\n\n1:06:11.500 --> 1:06:13.380\n in the world to flow into the crypto economy.\n\n1:06:13.380 --> 1:06:15.940\n So we're very proud of that.\n\n1:06:15.940 --> 1:06:18.620\n And I think we've helped a lot of that money flow in.\n\n1:06:18.620 --> 1:06:20.620\n Now, once people have money in crypto,\n\n1:06:20.620 --> 1:06:22.280\n they can choose to hold it in a variety of ways.\n\n1:06:22.280 --> 1:06:24.660\n And they can choose to hold it in a self custodial wallet,\n\n1:06:24.660 --> 1:06:26.240\n which is more decentralized.\n\n1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:29.580\n They can choose to use decentralized exchanges,\n\n1:06:29.580 --> 1:06:32.780\n which we love and Uniswap is not really,\n\n1:06:32.780 --> 1:06:34.920\n I don't think of them as like a direct competitor to us.\n\n1:06:34.920 --> 1:06:37.460\n We basically have integrated Uniswap\n\n1:06:37.460 --> 1:06:38.340\n into a number of our products.\n\n1:06:38.340 --> 1:06:41.460\n We love DeFi, decentralized exchanges, the whole thing.\n\n1:06:41.460 --> 1:06:46.320\n So Coinbase wallet, which is a self custodial wallet,\n\n1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:48.820\n is more decentralized and it allows people\n\n1:06:48.820 --> 1:06:51.500\n to hold their own crypto.\n\n1:06:51.500 --> 1:06:52.500\n They don't have to trust us.\n\n1:06:52.500 --> 1:06:55.860\n Can you explain what a self custodial wallet is?\n\n1:06:55.860 --> 1:06:58.900\n What is a wallet and what is a self custodial wallet?\n\n1:06:58.900 --> 1:07:00.540\n Yeah, so it's confusing.\n\n1:07:00.540 --> 1:07:04.260\n So a custodial wallet means you're trusting Coinbase\n\n1:07:04.260 --> 1:07:08.420\n to store your crypto, the private keys themselves.\n\n1:07:08.420 --> 1:07:11.420\n And for some people and institutions and everything,\n\n1:07:11.420 --> 1:07:12.940\n just meeting them where they are today,\n\n1:07:12.940 --> 1:07:15.480\n that's nice because it's simpler.\n\n1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:18.720\n They're not afraid of losing their crypto\n\n1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:20.660\n if they make some accidental mistake.\n\n1:07:20.660 --> 1:07:25.140\n Or so custodial crypto products are important\n\n1:07:25.140 --> 1:07:27.480\n to help get a bunch of people into the ecosystem.\n\n1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:30.580\n But I'm very supportive of self custodial wallets.\n\n1:07:30.580 --> 1:07:32.500\n And I think in some ways they are the future\n\n1:07:32.500 --> 1:07:34.380\n because more and more people are gonna want\n\n1:07:34.380 --> 1:07:35.340\n to store their own crypto,\n\n1:07:35.340 --> 1:07:37.320\n not trust a third party institution to do it.\n\n1:07:37.320 --> 1:07:38.940\n And in some ways that is much more authentic\n\n1:07:38.940 --> 1:07:40.140\n to the ethos of crypto.\n\n1:07:40.140 --> 1:07:43.700\n So Coinbase will help you convert the fiat into crypto.\n\n1:07:43.700 --> 1:07:46.020\n And frankly, that's a more centralized thing.\n\n1:07:46.020 --> 1:07:46.940\n But once you have crypto,\n\n1:07:46.940 --> 1:07:49.080\n you can then go to the self custodial world,\n\n1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:50.100\n store it yourself.\n\n1:07:50.100 --> 1:07:53.500\n And to get into the technical details just for a second,\n\n1:07:53.500 --> 1:07:56.500\n it's basically saying you're gonna store the keys\n\n1:07:56.500 --> 1:07:57.900\n on your own device.\n\n1:07:57.900 --> 1:08:02.860\n And so even if Coinbase gets some court order to seize it,\n\n1:08:02.860 --> 1:08:03.900\n we actually can't.\n\n1:08:03.900 --> 1:08:06.580\n From an architecture point of view, we can't do it.\n\n1:08:06.580 --> 1:08:08.520\n Or if Coinbase gets hacked or something,\n\n1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:09.960\n we can't lose your funds.\n\n1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:12.300\n Now the thing is you have to take the responsibility\n\n1:08:12.300 --> 1:08:13.140\n because we're not taking it.\n\n1:08:13.140 --> 1:08:15.920\n So the individual person could get hacked.\n\n1:08:15.920 --> 1:08:18.960\n And there's a whole bunch of really cool research happening\n\n1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:21.900\n to make self custodial wallets more resilient\n\n1:08:21.900 --> 1:08:28.060\n to accidental loss, hacks, and just user error.\n\n1:08:28.060 --> 1:08:30.140\n I don't know how much you've looked at various cryptography\n\n1:08:30.140 --> 1:08:35.780\n things, but basically, you can have multiple signatures\n\n1:08:35.780 --> 1:08:37.420\n from different keys on different devices\n\n1:08:37.420 --> 1:08:39.740\n where you need two of the three or three of the five.\n\n1:08:39.740 --> 1:08:43.220\n There's a whole technology called multi party computation\n\n1:08:43.220 --> 1:08:46.460\n or threshold signing signatures, which is really cool.\n\n1:08:46.460 --> 1:08:49.700\n But those are the things you would run locally?\n\n1:08:49.700 --> 1:08:52.460\n These are all security measures, cryptography measures\n\n1:08:52.460 --> 1:08:56.580\n to protect you without a centralized component?\n\n1:08:56.580 --> 1:08:57.100\n Right.\n\n1:08:57.100 --> 1:08:59.180\n So a simple example would be, let's\n\n1:08:59.180 --> 1:09:02.300\n say you had a two of three key signature.\n\n1:09:02.300 --> 1:09:04.820\n And one key might be stored at Coinbase,\n\n1:09:04.820 --> 1:09:06.220\n but that's not a quorum.\n\n1:09:06.220 --> 1:09:08.100\n So we couldn't unilaterally move your funds.\n\n1:09:08.100 --> 1:09:10.100\n But another key is on your device, on your phone,\n\n1:09:10.100 --> 1:09:10.740\n let's say.\n\n1:09:10.740 --> 1:09:12.100\n Oh, cool.\n\n1:09:12.100 --> 1:09:14.920\n So in a normal situation, you have a key on your phone.\n\n1:09:14.920 --> 1:09:17.420\n We have one.\n\n1:09:17.420 --> 1:09:20.060\n And so two out of three, it can all\n\n1:09:20.060 --> 1:09:21.900\n get signed very quickly for day to day use.\n\n1:09:21.900 --> 1:09:23.900\n But let's say you lose your phone or something.\n\n1:09:23.900 --> 1:09:25.420\n Now, there has to be a third key.\n\n1:09:25.420 --> 1:09:29.580\n And that's where you could store it in a backup somewhere,\n\n1:09:29.580 --> 1:09:31.820\n like in Google Drive or iCloud.\n\n1:09:31.820 --> 1:09:34.140\n You could trust a third party that's\n\n1:09:34.140 --> 1:09:36.260\n not Coinbase to also have that one key.\n\n1:09:36.260 --> 1:09:39.180\n And they can't do anything unilaterally with that one key.\n\n1:09:39.180 --> 1:09:40.700\n So that's a simple example.\n\n1:09:40.700 --> 1:09:42.260\n You can get way more complicated.\n\n1:09:42.260 --> 1:09:43.380\n Yeah, that's an awesome idea.\n\n1:09:43.380 --> 1:09:49.820\n So if your funds get seized, Coinbase can't do anything.\n\n1:09:49.820 --> 1:09:52.260\n But you better not lose your phone, maybe, in that case.\n\n1:09:52.260 --> 1:09:54.420\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:09:54.420 --> 1:09:56.660\n But it provides a, there is, so even if you lose your phone,\n\n1:09:56.660 --> 1:09:57.820\n then there is a recovery mechanism.\n\n1:09:57.820 --> 1:09:59.140\n Because you can get the one key from Coinbase,\n\n1:09:59.140 --> 1:10:01.500\n the one from your backup provider,\n\n1:10:01.500 --> 1:10:03.860\n and recover a new one back on your phone.\n\n1:10:03.860 --> 1:10:04.620\n I know, yeah.\n\n1:10:04.620 --> 1:10:06.820\n But what if Coinbase is no longer,\n\n1:10:06.820 --> 1:10:09.420\n but because of government, because of, say,\n\n1:10:09.420 --> 1:10:12.620\n it's in North Korea, government says you're no longer,\n\n1:10:12.620 --> 1:10:14.780\n like Coinbase is shut down in that country\n\n1:10:14.780 --> 1:10:15.820\n or something like that.\n\n1:10:15.820 --> 1:10:19.460\n Then you can get it, even if you have access to those two.\n\n1:10:19.460 --> 1:10:23.140\n So again, perhaps a silly question,\n\n1:10:23.140 --> 1:10:26.780\n but isn't a self custodial wallet a competitor\n\n1:10:26.780 --> 1:10:29.860\n as a notion to Coinbase?\n\n1:10:29.860 --> 1:10:33.420\n No, I mean, so we offer a self custodial wallet.\n\n1:10:33.420 --> 1:10:34.820\n We've built one, and it's like one.\n\n1:10:34.820 --> 1:10:37.060\n But doesn't it bleed the, like I guess\n\n1:10:37.060 --> 1:10:39.580\n I'm asking a sort of a financial question,\n\n1:10:39.580 --> 1:10:43.940\n is like how does Coinbase make money on transactions?\n\n1:10:43.940 --> 1:10:47.140\n So does this not, it does not decrease the number,\n\n1:10:47.140 --> 1:10:50.700\n or does not significantly negatively affect transactions?\n\n1:10:50.700 --> 1:10:53.980\n Or are you more focused on growing the number of the pie\n\n1:10:53.980 --> 1:10:56.700\n of the number of people that are using cryptocurrency?\n\n1:10:56.700 --> 1:10:58.580\n Yeah, like a traditional financial service firm\n\n1:10:58.580 --> 1:11:01.740\n would probably say, well, we should be storing,\n\n1:11:01.740 --> 1:11:03.740\n let's keep more of the custody with us,\n\n1:11:03.740 --> 1:11:05.780\n because that's how we prove to the world\n\n1:11:05.780 --> 1:11:07.540\n that we're valuable or whatever.\n\n1:11:07.540 --> 1:11:08.660\n I don't really believe that.\n\n1:11:08.660 --> 1:11:10.980\n Like I think that actually we kind of want to encourage\n\n1:11:10.980 --> 1:11:13.020\n our users to move to self custody over time\n\n1:11:13.020 --> 1:11:15.020\n for those who are ready and willing.\n\n1:11:15.020 --> 1:11:16.660\n And that technology needs to mature.\n\n1:11:16.660 --> 1:11:18.260\n I'm not trying to like force anybody to do it\n\n1:11:18.260 --> 1:11:19.100\n who doesn't want to do it.\n\n1:11:19.100 --> 1:11:21.300\n But to me, that's like the future\n\n1:11:21.300 --> 1:11:23.860\n of how we get billions of people using crypto.\n\n1:11:23.860 --> 1:11:27.420\n But doesn't that mean they can go somewhere else easier?\n\n1:11:27.420 --> 1:11:29.660\n Yeah, that's sort of the point is like,\n\n1:11:29.660 --> 1:11:31.020\n we're all using the same protocol.\n\n1:11:31.020 --> 1:11:32.340\n So there's low switching costs,\n\n1:11:32.340 --> 1:11:34.500\n which keeps all the companies accountable, right?\n\n1:11:34.500 --> 1:11:38.500\n Like if you want to access the visa network,\n\n1:11:38.500 --> 1:11:39.620\n there's only one company in the world\n\n1:11:39.620 --> 1:11:41.740\n you can go through to do that, like visa.\n\n1:11:41.740 --> 1:11:43.500\n But if you want to access the Bitcoin network,\n\n1:11:43.500 --> 1:11:45.780\n there's dozens or hundreds of companies out there\n\n1:11:45.780 --> 1:11:46.620\n who can do that.\n\n1:11:46.620 --> 1:11:50.620\n So it's arguably, you could argue it's worse for us\n\n1:11:50.620 --> 1:11:53.140\n as a company, but I think it's better for,\n\n1:11:53.140 --> 1:11:54.540\n it's what makes Bitcoin interesting\n\n1:11:54.540 --> 1:11:58.020\n and cryptocurrency interesting is that nobody controls it.\n\n1:11:58.020 --> 1:11:59.940\n There is low switching costs for customers.\n\n1:11:59.940 --> 1:12:01.180\n It's better for customers.\n\n1:12:01.180 --> 1:12:03.260\n And that means that all the companies in the space\n\n1:12:03.260 --> 1:12:04.500\n are going to be held to a high standard\n\n1:12:04.500 --> 1:12:06.060\n because the minute you lose someone's trust,\n\n1:12:06.060 --> 1:12:08.500\n they're just going to move their Bitcoin to some other service\n\n1:12:08.500 --> 1:12:10.220\n and that's good for the world.\n\n1:12:10.220 --> 1:12:12.500\n Do you think of Coinbase as,\n\n1:12:12.500 --> 1:12:14.300\n so there's these ideas of layer one,\n\n1:12:14.300 --> 1:12:17.060\n layer two, layer three technologies.\n\n1:12:17.060 --> 1:12:20.020\n Do you think of Coinbase as layer one,\n\n1:12:20.020 --> 1:12:21.700\n layer two, layer three?\n\n1:12:21.700 --> 1:12:25.180\n Now that said, there's so many products\n\n1:12:27.180 --> 1:12:28.740\n that are under the Coinbase umbrella\n\n1:12:28.740 --> 1:12:30.100\n that it's hard to answer that question,\n\n1:12:30.100 --> 1:12:31.940\n but what do you think?\n\n1:12:31.940 --> 1:12:34.340\n Do you acknowledge the existence of layer three?\n\n1:12:34.340 --> 1:12:38.860\n So, you know, usually when people are using those terms,\n\n1:12:38.860 --> 1:12:40.580\n layer one, layer two, so they're referring to like,\n\n1:12:40.580 --> 1:12:42.940\n layer one would be the blockchain,\n\n1:12:42.940 --> 1:12:43.820\n layer one blockchain itself,\n\n1:12:43.820 --> 1:12:45.780\n like a Bitcoin or Ethereum or something,\n\n1:12:45.780 --> 1:12:48.140\n not like a centralized service like Coinbase\n\n1:12:48.140 --> 1:12:51.740\n or even our decentralized self custodial wallet.\n\n1:12:51.740 --> 1:12:56.460\n So yeah, I wouldn't consider us to be like a layer one.\n\n1:12:56.460 --> 1:12:58.540\n These are the decentralized protocols\n\n1:12:58.540 --> 1:13:01.740\n that we're integrating, but Coinbase itself is not those.\n\n1:13:01.740 --> 1:13:05.180\n Yes, but layer two is the thing that was basically\n\n1:13:05.180 --> 1:13:09.180\n doing transactions without the settlement on the blockchain.\n\n1:13:09.180 --> 1:13:11.180\n And so you get to have some of the benefits\n\n1:13:11.180 --> 1:13:15.220\n of faster transactions without the security\n\n1:13:15.220 --> 1:13:16.420\n associated with the blockchain.\n\n1:13:16.420 --> 1:13:20.300\n And layer three is, I suppose,\n\n1:13:20.300 --> 1:13:23.060\n sort of apps built on top of that.\n\n1:13:23.060 --> 1:13:26.860\n So, you know, at least I think talking to Michael Saylor,\n\n1:13:26.860 --> 1:13:29.940\n he considers Coinbase a layer three technology.\n\n1:13:29.940 --> 1:13:31.180\n Interesting, okay.\n\n1:13:31.180 --> 1:13:34.460\n I'm not really particularly familiar\n\n1:13:34.460 --> 1:13:37.460\n with this kind of distinction of layer three and two.\n\n1:13:37.460 --> 1:13:40.340\n I don't see them as fundamentally different.\n\n1:13:40.340 --> 1:13:43.860\n But some of the, okay, I mean, one way of asking that,\n\n1:13:44.700 --> 1:13:48.180\n is there some layer two like of magic happening\n\n1:13:48.180 --> 1:13:50.220\n in order to make transactions associated\n\n1:13:50.220 --> 1:13:55.220\n with the blockchain happen instant, so that they're quick?\n\n1:13:55.460 --> 1:13:56.300\n So that.\n\n1:13:56.300 --> 1:13:57.140\n On Coinbase?\n\n1:13:57.140 --> 1:13:57.980\n On Coinbase, yeah.\n\n1:13:58.860 --> 1:14:00.140\n Is there some magic going on?\n\n1:14:00.140 --> 1:14:01.820\n Because you're, okay, we should say,\n\n1:14:01.820 --> 1:14:04.980\n how many cryptocurrencies are currently on Coinbase?\n\n1:14:04.980 --> 1:14:06.420\n So it's more than two.\n\n1:14:06.420 --> 1:14:07.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:07.580 --> 1:14:08.500\n It's a lot more than two.\n\n1:14:08.500 --> 1:14:09.340\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:09.340 --> 1:14:10.500\n So you have to understand,\n\n1:14:10.500 --> 1:14:12.580\n they have to incorporate all these technologies.\n\n1:14:12.580 --> 1:14:13.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:13.900 --> 1:14:16.140\n So how do you make that magic\n\n1:14:16.140 --> 1:14:18.820\n of sort of universal transactions happen\n\n1:14:18.820 --> 1:14:21.260\n across all of these different cryptocurrencies?\n\n1:14:23.260 --> 1:14:24.580\n There's our centralized products\n\n1:14:24.580 --> 1:14:25.860\n and decentralized products, right?\n\n1:14:25.860 --> 1:14:30.860\n The centralized products, we are storing that crypto for you.\n\n1:14:31.100 --> 1:14:33.460\n And so if you're moving from one of your accounts\n\n1:14:33.460 --> 1:14:36.100\n to another account, like an ETH1 account to ETH2 account,\n\n1:14:36.100 --> 1:14:39.860\n or from my ETH Coinbase centralized account\n\n1:14:39.860 --> 1:14:40.700\n to your ETH centralized.\n\n1:14:40.700 --> 1:14:43.580\n So we can do that transaction off chain to make it faster.\n\n1:14:43.580 --> 1:14:45.420\n And it saves the customer fees\n\n1:14:45.420 --> 1:14:47.020\n and it just confirms instantly.\n\n1:14:47.020 --> 1:14:49.180\n But it's not truly using the decentralized blockchain,\n\n1:14:49.180 --> 1:14:50.020\n right?\n\n1:14:50.020 --> 1:14:52.260\n So you can also send any Bitcoin address\n\n1:14:52.260 --> 1:14:53.940\n or Ethereum address, for instance.\n\n1:14:53.940 --> 1:14:56.420\n And that is putting the transaction on chain.\n\n1:14:56.420 --> 1:14:59.300\n Now our decentralized products like Coinbase wallet,\n\n1:14:59.300 --> 1:15:01.020\n the self custodial wallet,\n\n1:15:01.020 --> 1:15:03.580\n every transaction is happening on chain with that.\n\n1:15:03.580 --> 1:15:05.700\n And so basically it just shows a little bit\n\n1:15:05.700 --> 1:15:07.980\n of the evolution of Coinbase and the blockchains themselves.\n\n1:15:07.980 --> 1:15:12.980\n Like in the early days, these networks were not scalable.\n\n1:15:13.220 --> 1:15:16.820\n And so there were no L2 solutions, for instance.\n\n1:15:16.820 --> 1:15:18.540\n And so we had to do sort of these hacks,\n\n1:15:18.540 --> 1:15:20.140\n like moving the crypto off chain,\n\n1:15:20.140 --> 1:15:21.540\n if you were moving between your own accounts\n\n1:15:21.540 --> 1:15:22.460\n and stuff like that.\n\n1:15:22.460 --> 1:15:24.580\n Otherwise the minor fees would have just eaten us alive\n\n1:15:24.580 --> 1:15:25.780\n as a company, right?\n\n1:15:25.780 --> 1:15:26.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:26.620 --> 1:15:29.020\n But now the blockchains are starting to scale.\n\n1:15:29.020 --> 1:15:29.940\n There's a whole bunch of more work\n\n1:15:29.940 --> 1:15:30.780\n that needs to be done on that.\n\n1:15:30.780 --> 1:15:32.260\n And we're getting L2 solutions.\n\n1:15:32.260 --> 1:15:33.820\n So I think more and more of the transactions\n\n1:15:33.820 --> 1:15:36.620\n are going on chain, whether it's L2, L1.\n\n1:15:36.620 --> 1:15:41.620\n And ideally we shouldn't be doing that many transactions\n\n1:15:43.820 --> 1:15:47.060\n off chain, just internal Coinbase ledger or something.\n\n1:15:47.060 --> 1:15:48.740\n That's not really in the spirit of crypto.\n\n1:15:48.740 --> 1:15:53.740\n So when you say on chain, that includes layer two technology\n\n1:15:54.900 --> 1:15:56.740\n that the blockchain proposes.\n\n1:15:56.740 --> 1:15:57.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:59.580 --> 1:16:02.500\n I guess I was asking how much fun magic is happening\n\n1:16:02.500 --> 1:16:04.380\n off chain within Coinbase.\n\n1:16:04.380 --> 1:16:07.300\n And you're saying in the early days you had to,\n\n1:16:07.300 --> 1:16:09.620\n but you're trying to do less and less.\n\n1:16:09.620 --> 1:16:11.620\n So look, there's a bunch of high frequency traders\n\n1:16:11.620 --> 1:16:13.180\n that use the centralized products\n\n1:16:13.180 --> 1:16:15.620\n and even just regular retail people,\n\n1:16:15.620 --> 1:16:17.660\n they don't want to pay the gas fees and stuff.\n\n1:16:17.660 --> 1:16:19.340\n And they're trying to, it actually,\n\n1:16:19.340 --> 1:16:24.180\n we back at the envelope, calculated this out at one point\n\n1:16:24.180 --> 1:16:26.780\n and just like, it would be completely infeasible\n\n1:16:26.780 --> 1:16:28.140\n for like high frequency traders\n\n1:16:28.140 --> 1:16:29.780\n to put everything on chain at this point.\n\n1:16:29.780 --> 1:16:31.460\n That's basically what DEXs are doing.\n\n1:16:31.460 --> 1:16:33.660\n And so both are important.\n\n1:16:33.660 --> 1:16:35.700\n I think more and more is going to move decentralized\n\n1:16:35.700 --> 1:16:36.900\n over time, which is great.\n\n1:16:36.900 --> 1:16:38.340\n And we're, and we're basically.\n\n1:16:38.340 --> 1:16:40.340\n DEXs are decentralized exchanges by the way.\n\n1:16:40.340 --> 1:16:41.180\n Yeah.\n\n1:16:42.820 --> 1:16:45.460\n So anyway, we want to encourage more and more of it\n\n1:16:45.460 --> 1:16:46.860\n to move decentralized over time,\n\n1:16:46.860 --> 1:16:48.780\n but I don't, the centralized things aren't going away\n\n1:16:48.780 --> 1:16:50.220\n for like a long time.\n\n1:16:50.220 --> 1:16:51.340\n It's a decade from now,\n\n1:16:51.340 --> 1:16:54.340\n there's going to be some big institution\n\n1:16:54.340 --> 1:16:56.660\n or pension fund or central bank.\n\n1:16:56.660 --> 1:16:58.940\n That's like, all right, we got to hold crypto.\n\n1:16:58.940 --> 1:17:00.740\n Let's set up the account in a centralized way.\n\n1:17:00.740 --> 1:17:02.020\n So that's, that's fine.\n\n1:17:02.020 --> 1:17:03.220\n Both, both are important.\n\n1:17:03.220 --> 1:17:04.460\n Do you know the number\n\n1:17:04.460 --> 1:17:07.300\n of cryptocurrencies currently on Coinbase?\n\n1:17:07.300 --> 1:17:08.180\n Do you know that number?\n\n1:17:08.180 --> 1:17:10.660\n It's over a hundred, but it depends.\n\n1:17:10.660 --> 1:17:12.260\n It depends what jurisdiction you're in.\n\n1:17:12.260 --> 1:17:16.260\n And, you know, are you in institution versus retail?\n\n1:17:16.260 --> 1:17:19.020\n There's like, there's so many different categories now.\n\n1:17:19.020 --> 1:17:20.180\n But over a hundred.\n\n1:17:20.180 --> 1:17:21.660\n Yeah.\n\n1:17:21.660 --> 1:17:25.860\n So what does it take to become, to, to, to become an asset,\n\n1:17:25.860 --> 1:17:28.260\n to become a cryptocurrency on Coinbase,\n\n1:17:28.260 --> 1:17:32.300\n to add your technology to Coinbase?\n\n1:17:33.340 --> 1:17:36.500\n Okay. Well, so we're trying to get away from this idea\n\n1:17:36.500 --> 1:17:39.300\n of being listed on Coinbase as being seen as like\n\n1:17:39.300 --> 1:17:40.500\n an endorsement or something,\n\n1:17:40.500 --> 1:17:42.740\n because I actually think it's very important\n\n1:17:42.740 --> 1:17:47.740\n that we are not considered judge and jury about, you know,\n\n1:17:47.780 --> 1:17:49.460\n like imagine it was the early days of the internet\n\n1:17:49.460 --> 1:17:50.700\n and you were like, what's a good webpage\n\n1:17:50.700 --> 1:17:51.540\n and what's a bad webpage.\n\n1:17:51.540 --> 1:17:52.740\n Like you would have been totally wrong\n\n1:17:52.740 --> 1:17:57.140\n or anytime big tech companies try to make these review,\n\n1:17:57.140 --> 1:17:58.860\n review boards of like, you know,\n\n1:17:58.860 --> 1:18:00.500\n Apple famously gets in trouble for this a lot\n\n1:18:00.500 --> 1:18:02.060\n with their app store review process.\n\n1:18:02.060 --> 1:18:02.900\n Right.\n\n1:18:02.900 --> 1:18:06.180\n And so something that you think like a committee of people\n\n1:18:06.180 --> 1:18:08.060\n somewhere thinks looks silly may turn out\n\n1:18:08.060 --> 1:18:08.940\n to be the next big thing.\n\n1:18:08.940 --> 1:18:10.660\n Right. And so it's very difficult.\n\n1:18:10.660 --> 1:18:11.500\n So what do we do?\n\n1:18:11.500 --> 1:18:15.020\n We basically have a test of legality, right?\n\n1:18:15.020 --> 1:18:19.780\n We check, you know, do we believe this is a security?\n\n1:18:19.780 --> 1:18:21.620\n If so, it can't be listed on Coinbase\n\n1:18:21.620 --> 1:18:25.060\n and there's a very rigorous process we go through for that.\n\n1:18:25.060 --> 1:18:26.620\n Just currently the way the laws are in the US,\n\n1:18:26.620 --> 1:18:27.900\n you can't do that.\n\n1:18:27.900 --> 1:18:30.180\n And we've been, we acquired a broker duo license\n\n1:18:30.180 --> 1:18:31.020\n from the SEC.\n\n1:18:31.020 --> 1:18:32.820\n We're trying to work with them to get that operational\n\n1:18:32.820 --> 1:18:35.260\n and hopefully someday we can trade real crypto securities.\n\n1:18:35.260 --> 1:18:37.820\n But today that's not possible in the US at least.\n\n1:18:38.860 --> 1:18:40.900\n Then we look at sort of the cybersecurity\n\n1:18:40.900 --> 1:18:42.500\n of the crypto asset.\n\n1:18:42.500 --> 1:18:44.260\n Does it, do we see that there's some flaw\n\n1:18:44.260 --> 1:18:47.060\n in the smart contract or, you know,\n\n1:18:47.060 --> 1:18:49.340\n a way that somebody could manipulate it\n\n1:18:49.340 --> 1:18:51.260\n without the customer's permission?\n\n1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:54.700\n We look at some compliance pieces to it as well,\n\n1:18:54.700 --> 1:18:57.540\n like the actors behind it and like, you know,\n\n1:18:57.540 --> 1:19:00.100\n there any kind of criminal history, anything like that.\n\n1:19:00.100 --> 1:19:02.980\n But if we believe it meets our listing standards,\n\n1:19:02.980 --> 1:19:06.260\n basically this test of legality and everything\n\n1:19:06.260 --> 1:19:09.460\n for customer protection, then we want to list it\n\n1:19:09.460 --> 1:19:11.620\n because we want the market to at that point decide.\n\n1:19:11.620 --> 1:19:16.100\n And it's kind of like Amazon or something like that\n\n1:19:16.100 --> 1:19:18.860\n where, you know, a product might have three stars\n\n1:19:18.860 --> 1:19:19.900\n or it might have five stars,\n\n1:19:19.900 --> 1:19:22.420\n but if it starts to get one star consistently,\n\n1:19:22.420 --> 1:19:24.620\n like it's probably a fraudulent or it's defective\n\n1:19:24.620 --> 1:19:26.660\n or something like maybe Amazon will remove it.\n\n1:19:26.660 --> 1:19:29.060\n But otherwise you want to let the market decide\n\n1:19:29.060 --> 1:19:30.140\n what these things are.\n\n1:19:31.340 --> 1:19:32.900\n So that's generally how we do it.\n\n1:19:32.900 --> 1:19:36.180\n And by the way, more and more of these assets,\n\n1:19:36.180 --> 1:19:38.380\n I think especially like low market cap assets\n\n1:19:38.380 --> 1:19:40.500\n are going to be traded on DEXs through Coinbase.\n\n1:19:40.500 --> 1:19:41.620\n It's not that we,\n\n1:19:42.820 --> 1:19:45.220\n we don't need to list every asset on a centralized exchange.\n\n1:19:45.220 --> 1:19:47.780\n I think DEXs are really good for the long tail.\n\n1:19:47.780 --> 1:19:49.620\n And then it becomes an even,\n\n1:19:49.620 --> 1:19:50.860\n it's even more clear to people,\n\n1:19:50.860 --> 1:19:53.980\n like this is not some endorsement by a Coinbase of like,\n\n1:19:53.980 --> 1:19:55.380\n this asset's good and this one's bad.\n\n1:19:55.380 --> 1:19:57.900\n Like, you know, my belief is there's going to be millions\n\n1:19:57.900 --> 1:19:59.020\n of these assets over time.\n\n1:19:59.020 --> 1:20:02.380\n And so I hope it doesn't like make news\n\n1:20:02.380 --> 1:20:03.780\n every time we add one in the future, basically.\n\n1:20:03.780 --> 1:20:05.980\n Yeah, I wonder how you get there\n\n1:20:05.980 --> 1:20:10.580\n because I, even I look to Coinbase for, for example,\n\n1:20:10.580 --> 1:20:13.020\n you know, people, as you can imagine,\n\n1:20:13.020 --> 1:20:15.340\n sort of tag me on Twitter or something like that\n\n1:20:15.340 --> 1:20:20.340\n and all that, like you should interview our sort of this,\n\n1:20:20.580 --> 1:20:23.140\n the founder of this particular coin, right?\n\n1:20:23.140 --> 1:20:23.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:23.980 --> 1:20:27.340\n And I, it's so hard for me to know what's,\n\n1:20:27.340 --> 1:20:29.540\n first of all, what's interesting technology?\n\n1:20:30.540 --> 1:20:34.780\n What's, who's a scammer or not?\n\n1:20:34.780 --> 1:20:37.340\n Who's actually legitimately representing\n\n1:20:37.340 --> 1:20:42.340\n an ambitious new thing versus a scam?\n\n1:20:43.340 --> 1:20:46.180\n And I, you know, there's very few sources\n\n1:20:46.180 --> 1:20:50.540\n of like a verification signal.\n\n1:20:50.540 --> 1:20:52.780\n And unfortunately Coinbase in part\n\n1:20:52.780 --> 1:20:55.580\n has become a little bit of that too.\n\n1:20:55.580 --> 1:20:57.500\n And you're trying to get away from that\n\n1:20:57.500 --> 1:20:58.740\n because you're trying to get as many,\n\n1:20:58.740 --> 1:21:00.740\n sort of let the people decide.\n\n1:21:00.740 --> 1:21:03.940\n So you're thinking of like Amazon star type system\n\n1:21:03.940 --> 1:21:05.660\n where the people could rate.\n\n1:21:05.660 --> 1:21:07.380\n Yeah, so I think we'll actually probably add\n\n1:21:07.380 --> 1:21:09.060\n like user ratings and reviews.\n\n1:21:09.060 --> 1:21:12.660\n So, and we'll be very cautious about like, you know,\n\n1:21:12.660 --> 1:21:13.860\n these are real people.\n\n1:21:15.340 --> 1:21:17.340\n There's a bunch of stuff we have to do for that already.\n\n1:21:17.340 --> 1:21:19.820\n So I think wisdom of the crowds is good\n\n1:21:19.820 --> 1:21:21.940\n in terms of getting feedback on items,\n\n1:21:21.940 --> 1:21:24.180\n but we also, we're gonna do our own review,\n\n1:21:24.180 --> 1:21:25.180\n which I mentioned earlier, right?\n\n1:21:25.180 --> 1:21:27.620\n Which is like, okay, it meets this minimum bar\n\n1:21:27.620 --> 1:21:28.700\n to be listed on our site.\n\n1:21:28.700 --> 1:21:29.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:21:30.500 --> 1:21:32.180\n I think, yeah, both are important.\n\n1:21:32.180 --> 1:21:35.300\n How do you know if a coin is a scam or not?\n\n1:21:36.580 --> 1:21:39.100\n Well, you can see a few things.\n\n1:21:39.100 --> 1:21:41.140\n So, you know, I hate to use the word scam\n\n1:21:41.140 --> 1:21:42.580\n because a lot of these are judgment calls.\n\n1:21:42.580 --> 1:21:45.140\n You gotta, I kind of, a court may or a jury\n\n1:21:45.140 --> 1:21:45.980\n may land either way,\n\n1:21:45.980 --> 1:21:48.980\n but things that would be red flags to look at would be,\n\n1:21:50.060 --> 1:21:53.620\n you know, is a bunch of the asset owned by an insider\n\n1:21:53.620 --> 1:21:56.820\n or insiders with short vesting periods.\n\n1:21:56.820 --> 1:22:01.820\n You know, does the background of the founders,\n\n1:22:02.940 --> 1:22:04.820\n like they may have criminal records\n\n1:22:04.820 --> 1:22:08.260\n or if they've perpetrated other frauds in the past, right?\n\n1:22:08.260 --> 1:22:10.460\n There's a difference between something\n\n1:22:10.460 --> 1:22:13.900\n which is just a me too product.\n\n1:22:13.900 --> 1:22:16.100\n It's like, it doesn't have anything interesting about it\n\n1:22:16.100 --> 1:22:18.220\n and something that's an actual fraud or outright scam.\n\n1:22:18.220 --> 1:22:21.300\n And you have to, a lot of this data,\n\n1:22:21.300 --> 1:22:23.540\n what's cool about it is that it's now available on chain.\n\n1:22:23.540 --> 1:22:25.500\n You can look at like the tokenomics behind it\n\n1:22:25.500 --> 1:22:26.340\n and see who owns it.\n\n1:22:26.340 --> 1:22:31.340\n And are they selling it, you know, in like inappropriately\n\n1:22:32.740 --> 1:22:35.900\n or are they pumping it on like YouTube and Twitter\n\n1:22:35.900 --> 1:22:38.140\n and making promises about,\n\n1:22:38.140 --> 1:22:40.260\n hey, the value of this thing may be a higher in the future.\n\n1:22:40.260 --> 1:22:42.220\n And like, all those are just big, big no, no's\n\n1:22:42.220 --> 1:22:45.860\n that we would, you know, we just don't wanna go there.\n\n1:22:45.860 --> 1:22:48.220\n So our whole thing is like,\n\n1:22:48.220 --> 1:22:50.900\n we want to enable innovation in this space,\n\n1:22:50.900 --> 1:22:54.620\n but not allow anybody to curtail the advancement\n\n1:22:54.620 --> 1:22:57.380\n of this industry by like doing some kind of fraudulent thing\n\n1:22:57.380 --> 1:22:58.420\n or get rich quick thing.\n\n1:22:58.420 --> 1:22:59.260\n So.\n\n1:22:59.260 --> 1:23:00.100\n It's a tricky industry\n\n1:23:00.100 --> 1:23:02.700\n because I'm trying to figure out who to, you know,\n\n1:23:03.780 --> 1:23:07.820\n what's interesting to understand, to research.\n\n1:23:07.820 --> 1:23:09.860\n And it's hard to know.\n\n1:23:09.860 --> 1:23:11.780\n Let me ask you about a tricky one\n\n1:23:11.780 --> 1:23:13.460\n to add to a centralized exchange,\n\n1:23:13.460 --> 1:23:16.300\n which is privacy preserving cryptocurrency.\n\n1:23:16.300 --> 1:23:17.420\n So like Monero.\n\n1:23:17.420 --> 1:23:18.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:23:18.260 --> 1:23:21.700\n Is that technically difficult or is that why,\n\n1:23:21.700 --> 1:23:24.580\n why is like Monero, for example, forget that specific one,\n\n1:23:24.580 --> 1:23:29.580\n but like privacy preserving cryptocurrency blockchains,\n\n1:23:29.860 --> 1:23:32.260\n why is that, is that ever possible to add?\n\n1:23:33.340 --> 1:23:35.100\n So that's a great question.\n\n1:23:35.100 --> 1:23:36.220\n So the answer is maybe.\n\n1:23:36.220 --> 1:23:40.300\n So here's the reason why.\n\n1:23:40.300 --> 1:23:43.700\n So because we're a regulated financial service business,\n\n1:23:43.700 --> 1:23:46.300\n we have various licenses to do that.\n\n1:23:46.300 --> 1:23:48.500\n We are regulated by various regulators.\n\n1:23:48.500 --> 1:23:51.060\n Part of those licenses requires us to have a quote,\n\n1:23:51.060 --> 1:23:56.060\n reasonable program to monitor for suspicious activity,\n\n1:23:57.260 --> 1:23:59.660\n you know, an AML program, anti money laundering, right?\n\n1:23:59.660 --> 1:24:03.860\n And so if it, if a coin is a hundred percent anonymous\n\n1:24:03.860 --> 1:24:05.540\n and we can't really do blockchain analytics\n\n1:24:05.540 --> 1:24:07.820\n to track source of funds\n\n1:24:07.820 --> 1:24:09.700\n and where these things might be going,\n\n1:24:09.700 --> 1:24:14.700\n it makes it harder to have a reasonable program around that\n\n1:24:15.100 --> 1:24:16.020\n that's defensible.\n\n1:24:16.020 --> 1:24:19.420\n Now there are privacy preserving coins like Zcash,\n\n1:24:19.420 --> 1:24:21.220\n which have something called a view key.\n\n1:24:21.220 --> 1:24:23.300\n And a view key is basically another key\n\n1:24:23.300 --> 1:24:26.060\n which allows you to deanonymize the transactions\n\n1:24:26.060 --> 1:24:28.100\n in specific situations where you want that.\n\n1:24:28.100 --> 1:24:30.820\n So for instance, you know, we do support Zcash.\n\n1:24:30.820 --> 1:24:32.420\n And one of the ways we got comfortable with that\n\n1:24:32.420 --> 1:24:35.180\n is that when you're buying it on Coinbase,\n\n1:24:36.140 --> 1:24:38.380\n you know, you can basically have a view key.\n\n1:24:38.380 --> 1:24:41.100\n The transactions are not anonymous while you're buying it.\n\n1:24:41.100 --> 1:24:42.660\n And we can see where it goes afterwards\n\n1:24:42.660 --> 1:24:44.420\n and do our whole standard program.\n\n1:24:45.420 --> 1:24:48.020\n Now, if it gets a few hops away down the road,\n\n1:24:48.020 --> 1:24:50.100\n I mean, people could eventually turn on\n\n1:24:50.100 --> 1:24:51.820\n privacy preserving aspects.\n\n1:24:51.820 --> 1:24:53.860\n So, you know, these are tough judgment calls,\n\n1:24:53.860 --> 1:24:55.780\n but at least in terms of our interaction\n\n1:24:55.780 --> 1:24:56.940\n with the customer and everything,\n\n1:24:56.940 --> 1:24:58.580\n we feel comfortable at that.\n\n1:24:58.580 --> 1:25:00.380\n I think there's a broader point here,\n\n1:25:00.380 --> 1:25:03.260\n which is that I actually think privacy coins\n\n1:25:03.260 --> 1:25:05.780\n are a good thing for the world and they should be allowed.\n\n1:25:05.780 --> 1:25:08.500\n And more like, you know, despite,\n\n1:25:08.500 --> 1:25:10.380\n we've made this judgment call to operate\n\n1:25:10.380 --> 1:25:11.900\n in a regulated and safe and compliant way,\n\n1:25:11.900 --> 1:25:15.220\n but just taking my Coinbase hat off for a minute,\n\n1:25:15.220 --> 1:25:17.620\n I think the world would be a better place\n\n1:25:17.620 --> 1:25:19.100\n if there were more privacy coins,\n\n1:25:19.100 --> 1:25:20.780\n because it's kind of like the internet\n\n1:25:20.780 --> 1:25:24.300\n when it first came online, like there was no HTTPS,\n\n1:25:24.300 --> 1:25:26.620\n everything was HTTP and there was, you know,\n\n1:25:26.620 --> 1:25:28.140\n so people were afraid to put their credit cards\n\n1:25:28.140 --> 1:25:31.580\n on the internet and your messages could be intercepted\n\n1:25:31.580 --> 1:25:32.420\n and all this stuff.\n\n1:25:32.420 --> 1:25:34.540\n And now the whole internet has basically moved to HTTPS\n\n1:25:34.540 --> 1:25:37.380\n with a little lock icon in your browser, which is better.\n\n1:25:37.380 --> 1:25:39.260\n Like, and financial information\n\n1:25:39.260 --> 1:25:41.500\n is like the most important information to keep private,\n\n1:25:41.500 --> 1:25:42.620\n right?\n\n1:25:42.620 --> 1:25:44.420\n So there's times where like,\n\n1:25:44.420 --> 1:25:46.060\n let's say you're running a charity or something\n\n1:25:46.060 --> 1:25:47.940\n and you want to have total auditability,\n\n1:25:47.940 --> 1:25:49.700\n transparency for the whole world,\n\n1:25:49.700 --> 1:25:51.300\n who donated and where did the money go?\n\n1:25:51.300 --> 1:25:53.220\n That's great, you want it to be public.\n\n1:25:53.220 --> 1:25:56.100\n But if it's like your personal money or something like that,\n\n1:25:56.100 --> 1:25:58.100\n you don't want to be broadcasting that to the whole world.\n\n1:25:58.100 --> 1:26:00.620\n And in some ways that's what blockchains are doing,\n\n1:26:00.620 --> 1:26:01.900\n you know, pseudonymously,\n\n1:26:01.900 --> 1:26:03.740\n because like, but it is a public ledger.\n\n1:26:03.740 --> 1:26:05.780\n And so if you can know who owns each address,\n\n1:26:05.780 --> 1:26:07.780\n you can basically deanonymize it.\n\n1:26:07.780 --> 1:26:11.500\n I, you know, I think basically people should fight\n\n1:26:11.500 --> 1:26:13.980\n for privacy and freedoms of all kinds,\n\n1:26:13.980 --> 1:26:16.020\n but privacy of money is a good thing.\n\n1:26:16.020 --> 1:26:17.540\n So I would like to see more of that in the future.\n\n1:26:17.540 --> 1:26:22.540\n You chosen with Coinbase to have a seat at the table\n\n1:26:23.700 --> 1:26:25.140\n with the regulators.\n\n1:26:25.140 --> 1:26:30.140\n So what kind of conversations are there at that table?\n\n1:26:31.380 --> 1:26:33.500\n What are the regulations like?\n\n1:26:33.500 --> 1:26:36.860\n What is the level of understanding with regulators?\n\n1:26:36.860 --> 1:26:38.140\n What are they worried about?\n\n1:26:38.140 --> 1:26:39.260\n What are they thinking about?\n\n1:26:39.260 --> 1:26:42.900\n What are the positive and what are the negative regulations\n\n1:26:42.900 --> 1:26:44.580\n that you're facing?\n\n1:26:44.580 --> 1:26:48.060\n That you're educating, struggling with, pushing back on,\n\n1:26:48.060 --> 1:26:49.780\n supporting, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:26:49.780 --> 1:26:51.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:51.220 --> 1:26:52.140\n Oh man, there's so many.\n\n1:26:52.140 --> 1:26:55.540\n Cause we're, I mean, we're live in like, you know,\n\n1:26:55.540 --> 1:26:56.980\n maybe a hundred countries or more at this point.\n\n1:26:56.980 --> 1:26:59.900\n So the conversations are all over the map.\n\n1:26:59.900 --> 1:27:02.020\n I'm trying to think what broad strokes I could paint for you.\n\n1:27:02.020 --> 1:27:06.380\n So I'd say one trend that's positive is that basically\n\n1:27:06.380 --> 1:27:09.140\n regulators around the world are more and more,\n\n1:27:09.140 --> 1:27:11.460\n over the last five years, I would say,\n\n1:27:11.460 --> 1:27:15.780\n it's more and more common to find a regulator today asking,\n\n1:27:15.780 --> 1:27:17.740\n how can we preserve the innovation potential\n\n1:27:17.740 --> 1:27:21.140\n of this technology while keeping the bad actors out\n\n1:27:21.140 --> 1:27:23.500\n than it was five years ago, where they were saying,\n\n1:27:23.500 --> 1:27:24.500\n this is all bad activity.\n\n1:27:24.500 --> 1:27:25.700\n How do we prevent it?\n\n1:27:25.700 --> 1:27:28.500\n And so maybe this is.\n\n1:27:28.500 --> 1:27:32.460\n When you say more and more, what fraction?\n\n1:27:34.340 --> 1:27:36.500\n I'll give you like a US specific example,\n\n1:27:36.500 --> 1:27:38.180\n although we operate in many countries.\n\n1:27:38.180 --> 1:27:42.580\n So when I go to DC now, I would say, you know,\n\n1:27:42.580 --> 1:27:46.620\n 50, 60% of the people who I meet with are basically,\n\n1:27:46.620 --> 1:27:49.020\n you know, they're in the camp of crypto,\n\n1:27:49.020 --> 1:27:50.260\n has a lot of potential.\n\n1:27:50.260 --> 1:27:52.300\n We should regulate it to make sure the bad people\n\n1:27:52.300 --> 1:27:53.540\n don't do something bad with it.\n\n1:27:53.540 --> 1:27:56.220\n But this is here to stay and it has a lot of upside.\n\n1:27:56.220 --> 1:27:59.340\n We should basically create the awful regulation\n\n1:27:59.340 --> 1:28:01.980\n and celebrate it and actually encourage this innovation\n\n1:28:01.980 --> 1:28:03.180\n to happen in the US.\n\n1:28:03.180 --> 1:28:06.580\n That's a huge change from just three years ago\n\n1:28:06.580 --> 1:28:08.380\n where it was probably 30% of people saying that.\n\n1:28:08.380 --> 1:28:10.420\n Now it's like 60, it's like almost double.\n\n1:28:10.420 --> 1:28:13.340\n It's getting harder to find like true crypto skeptics\n\n1:28:13.340 --> 1:28:15.860\n in DC.\n\n1:28:15.860 --> 1:28:19.580\n I'd say that, you know, maybe only like 20 or 30% of people\n\n1:28:19.580 --> 1:28:21.900\n are like willing to say something negative.\n\n1:28:21.900 --> 1:28:23.580\n Like they actually think it's net negative.\n\n1:28:23.580 --> 1:28:25.660\n It's like, it's really hard to defend that position\n\n1:28:25.660 --> 1:28:28.660\n at this point, because almost like one in five Americans\n\n1:28:28.660 --> 1:28:30.100\n have used or tried crypto at this point.\n\n1:28:30.100 --> 1:28:32.940\n So you're kind of condemning 20% of your fellow citizens\n\n1:28:32.940 --> 1:28:36.020\n if you say that at this point, you know,\n\n1:28:36.020 --> 1:28:37.260\n especially with NFTs and all these things,\n\n1:28:37.260 --> 1:28:39.180\n like a huge segment of people who don't even care\n\n1:28:39.180 --> 1:28:41.580\n about investing or whatever came into the space.\n\n1:28:41.580 --> 1:28:45.420\n So, and then basically that's that same conversation\n\n1:28:45.420 --> 1:28:49.460\n is happening, but, you know, delayed by a few years\n\n1:28:49.460 --> 1:28:53.140\n in like India and Europe and in some Asian countries.\n\n1:28:53.140 --> 1:28:56.260\n And some countries have really embraced crypto\n\n1:28:56.260 --> 1:28:58.140\n and they're like trying to really,\n\n1:28:59.660 --> 1:29:00.940\n they're ahead of where the US is\n\n1:29:00.940 --> 1:29:03.340\n because they're trying to actually attract\n\n1:29:03.340 --> 1:29:06.260\n the best startups and entrepreneurs like, you know, like Dubai\n\n1:29:06.260 --> 1:29:08.060\n and UK and Australia and all are kind of pushing\n\n1:29:08.060 --> 1:29:11.500\n good regulation, El Salvador actually, I guess,\n\n1:29:11.500 --> 1:29:13.540\n adopted it as like Bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\n1:29:13.540 --> 1:29:15.580\n There was another country, Central African Republic,\n\n1:29:15.580 --> 1:29:18.220\n I think that is supposedly did that as well.\n\n1:29:18.220 --> 1:29:20.540\n But, you know, there's countries like China\n\n1:29:20.540 --> 1:29:22.140\n that are more autocratic that are saying,\n\n1:29:22.140 --> 1:29:24.580\n hey, this is a threat to our power\n\n1:29:24.580 --> 1:29:26.420\n and like, we're gonna try to really curtail it.\n\n1:29:26.420 --> 1:29:30.700\n So what kind of regulations are there that you feel the most\n\n1:29:30.700 --> 1:29:33.260\n that are limiting or that are empowering?\n\n1:29:33.260 --> 1:29:35.300\n Like, is there specific examples?\n\n1:29:35.300 --> 1:29:36.140\n Yeah, okay.\n\n1:29:36.140 --> 1:29:39.300\n So, I mean, basically I think the securities laws\n\n1:29:39.300 --> 1:29:44.420\n in the US need to be clarified about what,\n\n1:29:44.420 --> 1:29:45.620\n crypto is many different things.\n\n1:29:45.620 --> 1:29:46.620\n That's what people don't realize.\n\n1:29:46.620 --> 1:29:49.700\n So like some crypto, like Bitcoin, Ethereum\n\n1:29:49.700 --> 1:29:53.180\n and many others are probably more like commodities.\n\n1:29:53.180 --> 1:29:55.300\n They're not controlled by any one person, you know,\n\n1:29:55.300 --> 1:29:58.180\n like anyway, there's people who wanna raise money\n\n1:29:58.180 --> 1:30:00.320\n for a company that's sounds more like a security\n\n1:30:00.320 --> 1:30:02.420\n that should be regulated by the SEC.\n\n1:30:02.420 --> 1:30:04.540\n Commodities are regulated by the CFTC.\n\n1:30:04.540 --> 1:30:06.420\n Then there's some cryptocurrencies\n\n1:30:06.420 --> 1:30:08.300\n which are more like currencies,\n\n1:30:08.300 --> 1:30:10.800\n like stable coins and central bank digital currencies.\n\n1:30:10.800 --> 1:30:12.900\n And those are probably, you know,\n\n1:30:12.900 --> 1:30:15.180\n should be regulated by the treasury or someone like that.\n\n1:30:15.180 --> 1:30:16.620\n And then there's a whole another category\n\n1:30:16.620 --> 1:30:18.380\n of cryptocurrencies, which are none of those things.\n\n1:30:18.380 --> 1:30:21.760\n They're NFTs like artwork or they're metaverse items\n\n1:30:21.760 --> 1:30:23.620\n or decentralized identity and voting.\n\n1:30:23.620 --> 1:30:28.620\n And so I think that there's a very unhelpful point of view\n\n1:30:28.620 --> 1:30:31.180\n out there by some folks, which is,\n\n1:30:31.180 --> 1:30:34.420\n hey, this is all, most of this is like bad activity.\n\n1:30:34.420 --> 1:30:35.860\n We need to shut it down.\n\n1:30:35.860 --> 1:30:38.020\n So we're just gonna pursue enforcement actions\n\n1:30:38.020 --> 1:30:39.100\n or something like that.\n\n1:30:39.100 --> 1:30:41.140\n Most people in DC don't feel that way anymore.\n\n1:30:41.140 --> 1:30:43.780\n And I think the people of the US don't feel that way anymore\n\n1:30:43.780 --> 1:30:45.100\n because a lot of them are using this stuff.\n\n1:30:45.100 --> 1:30:47.260\n And their general view is,\n\n1:30:47.260 --> 1:30:48.820\n there's a lot of upside potential here.\n\n1:30:48.820 --> 1:30:51.100\n We can all agree, let's get rid of the fraud and the scams.\n\n1:30:51.100 --> 1:30:52.380\n We all wanna get rid of that.\n\n1:30:52.380 --> 1:30:56.900\n So let's create a relatively simple test, which says,\n\n1:30:56.900 --> 1:31:01.900\n if it's like nobody controls more than 20% of it\n\n1:31:02.860 --> 1:31:05.540\n or some threshold, it probably is more like a commodity.\n\n1:31:05.540 --> 1:31:07.540\n If someone's raising money for,\n\n1:31:07.540 --> 1:31:09.980\n they're selling this thing for a business,\n\n1:31:09.980 --> 1:31:11.100\n then it's probably a security.\n\n1:31:11.100 --> 1:31:14.340\n And then if it's more like a medium of exchange,\n\n1:31:14.340 --> 1:31:15.180\n it's a currency.\n\n1:31:15.180 --> 1:31:16.060\n And if it's none of those things,\n\n1:31:16.060 --> 1:31:18.260\n maybe it's artwork or whatever,\n\n1:31:18.260 --> 1:31:21.460\n a legal test like that would help clarify who,\n\n1:31:21.460 --> 1:31:23.540\n which regulator is regulating what.\n\n1:31:23.540 --> 1:31:26.980\n And then we also wanna have probably like a sandbox\n\n1:31:26.980 --> 1:31:29.100\n for innovation where if you're a startup\n\n1:31:29.100 --> 1:31:31.860\n and you're doing less than, I don't know, some number,\n\n1:31:33.260 --> 1:31:34.980\n less than some amount of payment volume\n\n1:31:34.980 --> 1:31:36.380\n or customer funds you're storing,\n\n1:31:36.380 --> 1:31:38.700\n it's like just let those things get off the ground\n\n1:31:38.700 --> 1:31:42.100\n without a soul crushing amount of legal bills\n\n1:31:42.100 --> 1:31:42.940\n and uncertainty.\n\n1:31:42.940 --> 1:31:46.020\n So if the US can get there, that would be great.\n\n1:31:46.020 --> 1:31:47.980\n I think a bunch of other countries now are rushing\n\n1:31:47.980 --> 1:31:50.300\n around the world to sort of create that regulation\n\n1:31:50.300 --> 1:31:52.540\n that does attract innovation.\n\n1:31:52.540 --> 1:31:57.100\n And so in the international bodies like IMF and G20\n\n1:31:57.100 --> 1:32:00.140\n and stuff, they're starting to look at proposed regulation.\n\n1:32:00.140 --> 1:32:02.140\n I hope that Coinbase and a bunch of other crypto companies\n\n1:32:02.140 --> 1:32:03.300\n can help in that conversation too.\n\n1:32:03.300 --> 1:32:04.900\n We have a whole policy effort.\n\n1:32:04.900 --> 1:32:07.100\n I think actually crypto policy efforts\n\n1:32:07.100 --> 1:32:08.380\n are like probably one of the biggest things\n\n1:32:08.380 --> 1:32:09.220\n in DC right now.\n\n1:32:09.220 --> 1:32:13.420\n So it moves slow at the speed of government,\n\n1:32:13.420 --> 1:32:16.660\n but yeah, and in the meantime,\n\n1:32:16.660 --> 1:32:18.500\n we're just trying to help more and more people use crypto\n\n1:32:18.500 --> 1:32:20.940\n because ultimately that's what, in the democracies,\n\n1:32:20.940 --> 1:32:22.100\n that's what they care about.\n\n1:32:22.100 --> 1:32:24.780\n Like they'll do what the people of the country want.\n\n1:32:24.780 --> 1:32:27.060\n So you want governments to start understanding\n\n1:32:27.060 --> 1:32:29.460\n differences between, in the crypto space,\n\n1:32:29.460 --> 1:32:32.460\n commodities, securities, currencies, NFTs.\n\n1:32:32.460 --> 1:32:34.020\n I still don't understand.\n\n1:32:34.020 --> 1:32:37.060\n What are they supposed to make sense of NFTs?\n\n1:32:37.060 --> 1:32:41.100\n What is NFTs exactly from a perspective of a regulator?\n\n1:32:41.100 --> 1:32:42.980\n Yeah, so.\n\n1:32:42.980 --> 1:32:44.820\n Is it the other categories?\n\n1:32:44.820 --> 1:32:47.140\n Yeah, most NFTs you could think of as like artwork,\n\n1:32:47.140 --> 1:32:49.020\n although it's, who knows where it's gonna go.\n\n1:32:49.020 --> 1:32:49.860\n It could be.\n\n1:32:49.860 --> 1:32:50.700\n You mentioned Metaverse, right?\n\n1:32:50.700 --> 1:32:54.860\n You mentioned some kind of unique identity of a thing.\n\n1:32:54.860 --> 1:32:59.860\n Yeah, like there's people selling virtual land in NFTs.\n\n1:32:59.860 --> 1:33:02.740\n I actually, I bought this NFT that's like,\n\n1:33:02.740 --> 1:33:05.940\n it's like citizenship in this like city, Dow in Wyoming.\n\n1:33:05.940 --> 1:33:06.780\n Like I've never been there,\n\n1:33:06.780 --> 1:33:11.540\n but it's almost like a badge or an attestation\n\n1:33:11.540 --> 1:33:13.380\n like to get access to this location.\n\n1:33:14.660 --> 1:33:17.380\n There's like people doing like tickets to events.\n\n1:33:17.380 --> 1:33:19.660\n Like, you know, they're called a POAPs.\n\n1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:23.620\n Like proof of attendance and things like that.\n\n1:33:23.620 --> 1:33:27.820\n So it'll be very interesting to see where NFTs go over time.\n\n1:33:27.820 --> 1:33:29.940\n It could get, and that's the danger.\n\n1:33:29.940 --> 1:33:31.740\n You don't wanna try to like define the regulation\n\n1:33:31.740 --> 1:33:33.380\n if you don't even know where this thing's gonna go, so.\n\n1:33:33.380 --> 1:33:37.540\n And so your efforts in the policy arm is education?\n\n1:33:37.540 --> 1:33:39.900\n Yeah, education, advocacy.\n\n1:33:39.900 --> 1:33:42.100\n We're just trying to be like a helpful educational resource\n\n1:33:42.100 --> 1:33:43.860\n essentially, and then if they give us feedback\n\n1:33:43.860 --> 1:33:46.740\n and they're like, hey, don't do this or don't, or do this,\n\n1:33:46.740 --> 1:33:50.540\n like we're more than happy to do anything that's requested.\n\n1:33:50.540 --> 1:33:52.460\n We generally go get licenses\n\n1:33:52.460 --> 1:33:53.820\n and we've just tried to do the right thing\n\n1:33:53.820 --> 1:33:54.940\n in the absence of clarity,\n\n1:33:54.940 --> 1:33:59.180\n because if it's not clear what the law says,\n\n1:33:59.180 --> 1:34:01.180\n then you should just basically do good things\n\n1:34:01.180 --> 1:34:02.780\n that you think may be required in the future\n\n1:34:02.780 --> 1:34:05.100\n to show good faith effort towards the right thing.\n\n1:34:05.100 --> 1:34:08.700\n And that's part of like innovating in a regulated field,\n\n1:34:08.700 --> 1:34:11.060\n which is, you know, a whole topic in itself.\n\n1:34:11.060 --> 1:34:13.820\n So if you are at the table,\n\n1:34:13.820 --> 1:34:17.300\n let me, this is less the case in the United States,\n\n1:34:17.300 --> 1:34:20.820\n but can government agencies seize a person's cryptocurrency\n\n1:34:20.820 --> 1:34:24.860\n by forcing Coinbase to hand it over?\n\n1:34:24.860 --> 1:34:26.380\n So when you're centralized,\n\n1:34:26.380 --> 1:34:28.220\n they have a phone number to call.\n\n1:34:28.220 --> 1:34:30.500\n Okay, so this is a complicated topic.\n\n1:34:31.980 --> 1:34:34.820\n Like if you really wanna be sure that,\n\n1:34:34.820 --> 1:34:36.700\n this is why people wanna store their own crypto, right?\n\n1:34:36.700 --> 1:34:37.980\n Like with self custodial wallets,\n\n1:34:37.980 --> 1:34:40.420\n like with Coinbase wallet embracing decentralization,\n\n1:34:40.420 --> 1:34:42.180\n they wanna avoid that.\n\n1:34:42.180 --> 1:34:44.820\n Now in the US, there is rule of law, right?\n\n1:34:44.820 --> 1:34:47.260\n So we have reasonable protections in place around\n\n1:34:48.220 --> 1:34:50.500\n like search and seizure and things like that.\n\n1:34:51.660 --> 1:34:52.700\n You know, Coinbase does,\n\n1:34:52.700 --> 1:34:54.460\n we publish transparency reports on this.\n\n1:34:54.460 --> 1:34:56.980\n We get subpoenas, court orders, things like that\n\n1:34:56.980 --> 1:35:00.340\n from various countries around the world.\n\n1:35:00.340 --> 1:35:04.740\n And there are situations where we have been ordered\n\n1:35:04.740 --> 1:35:06.780\n to freeze accounts, things like that.\n\n1:35:08.340 --> 1:35:09.420\n You know, we have to follow the law,\n\n1:35:09.420 --> 1:35:11.020\n is another way to put it.\n\n1:35:11.020 --> 1:35:13.580\n We're a regulated financial service business and so.\n\n1:35:13.580 --> 1:35:16.980\n If the money is used as part of breaking the law,\n\n1:35:16.980 --> 1:35:20.860\n that's what that, in a particular jurisdiction,\n\n1:35:20.860 --> 1:35:22.500\n in a particular.\n\n1:35:22.500 --> 1:35:23.940\n Right, and then the other thing,\n\n1:35:23.940 --> 1:35:25.820\n sometimes we will actually get court orders\n\n1:35:25.820 --> 1:35:27.220\n or subpoenas that are overly broad.\n\n1:35:27.220 --> 1:35:30.940\n We've seen, so they need to follow due process, right?\n\n1:35:30.940 --> 1:35:34.420\n And so we've seen some in the past that were like,\n\n1:35:34.420 --> 1:35:36.580\n well, we need you to freeze this huge number of accounts.\n\n1:35:36.580 --> 1:35:39.180\n And it's like, well, we'll actually have gone to court\n\n1:35:39.180 --> 1:35:40.820\n and like pushed back on some of these and said like,\n\n1:35:40.820 --> 1:35:42.940\n what is your probable cause?\n\n1:35:42.940 --> 1:35:44.460\n And has the threshold been met?\n\n1:35:44.460 --> 1:35:45.940\n And like, we've won some of those cases\n\n1:35:45.940 --> 1:35:46.940\n on behalf of our customers.\n\n1:35:46.940 --> 1:35:50.100\n So yeah, it's actually really,\n\n1:35:50.100 --> 1:35:51.380\n it's kind of unfortunate and frustrating.\n\n1:35:51.380 --> 1:35:54.820\n As a large business, you spend a lot of resources\n\n1:35:54.820 --> 1:35:59.500\n basically interacting with inbound requests\n\n1:35:59.500 --> 1:36:03.700\n by all kinds of lawyers and people and requesting things.\n\n1:36:03.700 --> 1:36:06.020\n And some of them are silly and ridiculous\n\n1:36:06.020 --> 1:36:07.420\n and you have to push back and say no.\n\n1:36:07.420 --> 1:36:11.780\n And so it's kind of a tax on every company at a certain size\n\n1:36:11.780 --> 1:36:14.340\n which ultimately gets passed on to the customer\n\n1:36:14.340 --> 1:36:15.180\n in higher fees.\n\n1:36:15.180 --> 1:36:17.540\n So you have to employ armies of lawyers\n\n1:36:17.540 --> 1:36:18.440\n to deal with this stuff.\n\n1:36:18.440 --> 1:36:19.820\n Can you educate me on something?\n\n1:36:19.820 --> 1:36:23.820\n How much innovation is there in the legal space?\n\n1:36:23.820 --> 1:36:26.340\n So for lawyers working with Coinbase\n\n1:36:26.340 --> 1:36:30.780\n because it's such a new cutting edge thing.\n\n1:36:30.780 --> 1:36:33.580\n So you're, there's a lot of gray area\n\n1:36:33.580 --> 1:36:36.520\n you're supposed to be operating under.\n\n1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:40.100\n Like how hard is it being a lawyer at Coinbase?\n\n1:36:41.100 --> 1:36:43.380\n Like how much precedence is there?\n\n1:36:43.380 --> 1:36:44.500\n I guess is what I'm asking.\n\n1:36:44.500 --> 1:36:46.600\n I mean, just like you said, three years.\n\n1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:49.580\n It's kind of a new space.\n\n1:36:49.580 --> 1:36:51.700\n Yeah, well, it's probably very hard\n\n1:36:51.700 --> 1:36:53.340\n to be a lawyer at Coinbase and very fun\n\n1:36:53.340 --> 1:36:57.200\n because whenever you're in a new field that's growing fast,\n\n1:36:57.200 --> 1:37:02.200\n there isn't a lot of case law and just precedent set.\n\n1:37:02.460 --> 1:37:04.460\n So that's also an opportunity for you\n\n1:37:04.460 --> 1:37:05.420\n to go create that stuff.\n\n1:37:05.420 --> 1:37:07.620\n And that's what a lot of legal careers are made out of\n\n1:37:07.620 --> 1:37:09.700\n is like take a complex situation\n\n1:37:09.700 --> 1:37:11.300\n where you have to balance difficult things.\n\n1:37:11.300 --> 1:37:13.100\n Like how do we prevent bad activity\n\n1:37:13.100 --> 1:37:14.140\n but still enable an innovation?\n\n1:37:14.140 --> 1:37:15.900\n That's a hard question.\n\n1:37:15.900 --> 1:37:18.460\n And there's, you can go draft legislation\n\n1:37:18.460 --> 1:37:19.740\n and circulate it to policymakers\n\n1:37:19.740 --> 1:37:21.820\n or come up with these policies\n\n1:37:21.820 --> 1:37:25.340\n and how do you operate a business in an environment\n\n1:37:25.340 --> 1:37:27.780\n where the law is just unclear, right?\n\n1:37:27.780 --> 1:37:29.980\n It's like try to do the right thing,\n\n1:37:31.220 --> 1:37:33.820\n but like strike the right balance.\n\n1:37:33.820 --> 1:37:36.260\n So yeah, a lot of our lawyers have to come up with that.\n\n1:37:36.260 --> 1:37:37.820\n Very creative stuff.\n\n1:37:37.820 --> 1:37:39.580\n You mentioned one of the things you're focused on\n\n1:37:39.580 --> 1:37:41.060\n is expanding the number of people,\n\n1:37:41.060 --> 1:37:46.060\n maybe a billion people on Coinbase or using cryptocurrency.\n\n1:37:46.340 --> 1:37:47.260\n Where are we at now?\n\n1:37:47.260 --> 1:37:49.020\n How do we get to a billion?\n\n1:37:49.020 --> 1:37:50.720\n As of Q4 last year,\n\n1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:53.660\n we had 89 million verified accounts on Coinbase,\n\n1:37:53.660 --> 1:37:58.660\n but in any given quarter, only maybe like 10\n\n1:37:59.220 --> 1:38:02.100\n or a little more million of those are like really active.\n\n1:38:02.100 --> 1:38:04.940\n So, and then if you look at globally,\n\n1:38:04.940 --> 1:38:06.220\n I think some of the estimates I've seen\n\n1:38:06.220 --> 1:38:08.500\n is maybe there's like 200 million people\n\n1:38:08.500 --> 1:38:11.560\n or something like that who have ever used or tried crypto.\n\n1:38:11.560 --> 1:38:15.620\n So we're a long, you know, we're ways from a billion,\n\n1:38:15.620 --> 1:38:17.600\n but it's not like that far off.\n\n1:38:18.540 --> 1:38:19.940\n How do you get there?\n\n1:38:19.940 --> 1:38:21.380\n How do you get to a billion?\n\n1:38:21.380 --> 1:38:22.420\n So a few things.\n\n1:38:22.420 --> 1:38:23.820\n One is the blockchains have got to become\n\n1:38:23.820 --> 1:38:24.740\n way more scalable.\n\n1:38:26.100 --> 1:38:28.020\n It's kind of like we're all running dial up modems\n\n1:38:28.020 --> 1:38:29.020\n and we need broadband.\n\n1:38:29.020 --> 1:38:32.180\n And so it's just like too expensive, too slow\n\n1:38:32.180 --> 1:38:33.220\n to do all these transactions.\n\n1:38:33.220 --> 1:38:37.980\n And I think if we just get L2s working and scalability,\n\n1:38:37.980 --> 1:38:39.940\n you know, we'll see another order of magnitude\n\n1:38:39.940 --> 1:38:41.600\n kind of come out just from that.\n\n1:38:42.860 --> 1:38:44.900\n I think the second one would be more clear regulation.\n\n1:38:44.900 --> 1:38:46.860\n That would help a lot.\n\n1:38:46.860 --> 1:38:49.540\n I do talk to, you know, pension funds\n\n1:38:49.540 --> 1:38:52.780\n and you know, various asset managers,\n\n1:38:52.780 --> 1:38:53.820\n sovereign wealth funds and stuff.\n\n1:38:53.820 --> 1:38:55.740\n And a lot of them tell me,\n\n1:38:55.740 --> 1:38:58.780\n we've got 1% of our portfolio in crypto today,\n\n1:38:58.780 --> 1:39:02.180\n but we really would rather have like 20% in there.\n\n1:39:02.180 --> 1:39:06.580\n But what we're waiting for is more clear regulation\n\n1:39:06.580 --> 1:39:08.860\n coming out and saying that clear test that I was saying,\n\n1:39:08.860 --> 1:39:11.020\n these assets are commodities regulated by SCPC,\n\n1:39:11.020 --> 1:39:13.720\n these are by SCC, these are by treasury, whatever.\n\n1:39:13.720 --> 1:39:15.500\n So that would be a big unlock.\n\n1:39:15.500 --> 1:39:16.580\n Do transactions.\n\n1:39:16.580 --> 1:39:20.940\n So one of the things that you mentioned, payments, sorry.\n\n1:39:20.940 --> 1:39:21.780\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:21.780 --> 1:39:23.880\n Well, does that unlock a lot of users?\n\n1:39:25.180 --> 1:39:26.100\n Yeah, it does.\n\n1:39:26.100 --> 1:39:28.260\n I mean, remittance is like a huge thing.\n\n1:39:28.260 --> 1:39:30.100\n People sending money home to their families\n\n1:39:30.100 --> 1:39:32.960\n in other countries where the fees are super high.\n\n1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:35.700\n So yeah, if we get blockchains to be more scalable\n\n1:39:35.700 --> 1:39:37.020\n and there's more global adoption,\n\n1:39:37.020 --> 1:39:40.240\n like I think we'll see remittance quarters\n\n1:39:40.240 --> 1:39:42.300\n move over to crypto a lot.\n\n1:39:42.300 --> 1:39:43.620\n There's also just,\n\n1:39:43.620 --> 1:39:45.360\n the other thing that's driving a lot of crypto adoption\n\n1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:49.300\n is basically the creation of more and more third party apps.\n\n1:39:49.300 --> 1:39:52.180\n So, or dApps they're sometimes called decentralized dApps.\n\n1:39:52.180 --> 1:39:55.340\n So a lot of startups now, you know,\n\n1:39:55.340 --> 1:39:57.420\n how like you used to use in the early 2000s,\n\n1:39:57.420 --> 1:39:58.540\n they called them.com startups,\n\n1:39:58.540 --> 1:39:59.980\n but now you don't need to say.com\n\n1:39:59.980 --> 1:40:01.500\n cause everybody's using the internet.\n\n1:40:01.500 --> 1:40:04.380\n And so now there's like hundreds or thousands\n\n1:40:04.380 --> 1:40:06.100\n of these crypto startups,\n\n1:40:06.100 --> 1:40:06.940\n but I think in the future,\n\n1:40:06.940 --> 1:40:08.180\n you won't need to call them crypto startups\n\n1:40:08.180 --> 1:40:09.260\n cause they'll just be called startups\n\n1:40:09.260 --> 1:40:11.900\n cause everyone's using the internet and crypto and whatever.\n\n1:40:11.900 --> 1:40:14.900\n So anyway, the use cases,\n\n1:40:14.900 --> 1:40:17.060\n the utility of crypto is getting better and better\n\n1:40:17.060 --> 1:40:19.060\n with like all these third party apps\n\n1:40:19.060 --> 1:40:20.180\n getting funded and created.\n\n1:40:20.180 --> 1:40:22.660\n And do you think there's going to be a killer\n\n1:40:22.660 --> 1:40:24.940\n or a set of killer dApps,\n\n1:40:24.940 --> 1:40:27.700\n like a thing where nobody can live without?\n\n1:40:27.700 --> 1:40:29.280\n Are we still waiting for that?\n\n1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:30.220\n There's going to be a bunch of them.\n\n1:40:30.220 --> 1:40:31.500\n It's just like, it's like the internet,\n\n1:40:31.500 --> 1:40:33.940\n like what were the killer web companies, you know,\n\n1:40:33.940 --> 1:40:37.020\n like Uber and Wikipedia and Airbnb and Google.\n\n1:40:37.020 --> 1:40:40.420\n And like, so there's going to be some big winners,\n\n1:40:40.420 --> 1:40:42.620\n but there'll be thousands of,\n\n1:40:42.620 --> 1:40:45.020\n this is basically the new,\n\n1:40:45.020 --> 1:40:46.740\n it's like what happened with the.com startups\n\n1:40:46.740 --> 1:40:47.580\n in the early 2000s.\n\n1:40:47.580 --> 1:40:49.140\n It's like a lot of the best entrepreneurs\n\n1:40:49.140 --> 1:40:50.800\n are building crypto startups now.\n\n1:40:50.800 --> 1:40:54.100\n So tons of venture money flowing into the space.\n\n1:40:54.100 --> 1:40:55.620\n A lot of smart young people, so.\n\n1:40:55.620 --> 1:40:57.620\n Do you think Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency\n\n1:40:57.620 --> 1:41:01.700\n will become the reserve currency of the world at some point?\n\n1:41:01.700 --> 1:41:03.740\n Cause this is kind of a controversial idea,\n\n1:41:03.740 --> 1:41:05.460\n but I actually think yes.\n\n1:41:06.520 --> 1:41:08.620\n I do think Bitcoin could end up becoming\n\n1:41:08.620 --> 1:41:10.820\n a reserve currency of the world.\n\n1:41:10.820 --> 1:41:13.140\n So I've been reading Ray Dalio recently\n\n1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:16.660\n with his new book, like The Changing World Order.\n\n1:41:16.660 --> 1:41:19.900\n And I thought it was a really well researched book.\n\n1:41:19.900 --> 1:41:21.780\n He talks in there, he looks back at history, right?\n\n1:41:21.780 --> 1:41:25.340\n He looks at like empires and going back\n\n1:41:25.340 --> 1:41:27.780\n to various Chinese empires, the Dutch and Ottomans\n\n1:41:27.780 --> 1:41:29.880\n and everybody, and how did they rise?\n\n1:41:29.880 --> 1:41:31.700\n And they were able to have the reserve currency\n\n1:41:31.700 --> 1:41:34.300\n as they rose and what produced that?\n\n1:41:34.300 --> 1:41:36.700\n Like it came from good education and innovation\n\n1:41:36.700 --> 1:41:39.260\n and better trade and anyway.\n\n1:41:39.260 --> 1:41:44.260\n So the US by some measures is kind of looks like it's,\n\n1:41:44.860 --> 1:41:46.640\n maybe it's had a really good run\n\n1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:47.940\n and it's coming down a little bit\n\n1:41:47.940 --> 1:41:49.940\n and China is kind of coming up.\n\n1:41:49.940 --> 1:41:51.260\n Who knows how that'll play out, by the way,\n\n1:41:51.260 --> 1:41:52.500\n like the world is very complicated.\n\n1:41:52.500 --> 1:41:54.080\n It could, that could switch.\n\n1:41:55.480 --> 1:41:59.260\n But I guess if the US dollar is gonna be seeing\n\n1:41:59.260 --> 1:42:00.700\n more inflation in the future,\n\n1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:05.900\n the Chinese Yuan is not like necessarily better, right?\n\n1:42:05.900 --> 1:42:08.500\n I mean, they have a ton of debt as well.\n\n1:42:08.500 --> 1:42:13.220\n And it's not like you could really,\n\n1:42:13.220 --> 1:42:15.500\n that the Yuan could be inflated as well, right?\n\n1:42:15.500 --> 1:42:17.020\n It probably will be.\n\n1:42:17.020 --> 1:42:19.960\n And so I do think that there's this group of people today\n\n1:42:19.960 --> 1:42:24.460\n which probably most traditional, I don't know,\n\n1:42:24.460 --> 1:42:27.340\n like the people who run big banks\n\n1:42:27.340 --> 1:42:28.820\n and like governments and stuff that they're not,\n\n1:42:28.820 --> 1:42:29.980\n this is not really on their radar today.\n\n1:42:29.980 --> 1:42:32.720\n But I think there's basically a group of younger people\n\n1:42:32.720 --> 1:42:37.520\n in that kind of 25, 35 year old range who are tech savvy.\n\n1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:39.420\n They're starting to think of crypto as like\n\n1:42:39.420 --> 1:42:42.100\n the primary thing in their financial life.\n\n1:42:42.100 --> 1:42:44.880\n It's like, I basically hold my wealth in crypto\n\n1:42:44.880 --> 1:42:47.900\n and I use dollars or euros or whatever.\n\n1:42:47.900 --> 1:42:49.400\n If I happen to need something,\n\n1:42:49.400 --> 1:42:50.620\n I convert it to that at the last minute.\n\n1:42:50.620 --> 1:42:52.340\n It's like, if I'm traveling,\n\n1:42:52.340 --> 1:42:54.060\n I might convert some local currency in the moment,\n\n1:42:54.060 --> 1:42:57.080\n but that's not where I hold most of my wealth.\n\n1:42:57.080 --> 1:43:01.560\n So this segment of the population is not like massive yet\n\n1:43:01.560 --> 1:43:02.580\n from a GDP point of view,\n\n1:43:02.580 --> 1:43:05.560\n but I think it's a leading indicator\n\n1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:06.680\n of where things could be going.\n\n1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:07.900\n And this is actually good for the world.\n\n1:43:07.900 --> 1:43:10.860\n It's kind of like, especially if China does continue\n\n1:43:10.860 --> 1:43:13.580\n to rise and it has a more authoritarian view,\n\n1:43:13.580 --> 1:43:16.880\n it'll be kind of this very centralized East\n\n1:43:16.880 --> 1:43:21.180\n versus a decentralized West where people are in the West,\n\n1:43:21.180 --> 1:43:24.380\n in the free world, really kind of embracing crypto\n\n1:43:24.380 --> 1:43:27.740\n and a more open, fair, free global financial system,\n\n1:43:27.740 --> 1:43:31.020\n which I think will be enormously beneficial for humanity.\n\n1:43:31.020 --> 1:43:33.900\n And I do think basically Bitcoin is the reserve currency,\n\n1:43:33.900 --> 1:43:36.180\n the gold standard of the crypto economy.\n\n1:43:37.700 --> 1:43:39.260\n So that's pretty crazy.\n\n1:43:39.260 --> 1:43:40.340\n Yeah, the gold standard.\n\n1:43:40.340 --> 1:43:43.620\n I mean, it's also like with Ray Dalio,\n\n1:43:43.620 --> 1:43:47.820\n I feel like China will drive a lot of this,\n\n1:43:47.820 --> 1:43:49.940\n either in response or directly.\n\n1:43:49.940 --> 1:43:52.340\n I mean, I think the ruble,\n\n1:43:52.340 --> 1:43:55.400\n I'm not paying as close attention to the financial systems,\n\n1:43:55.400 --> 1:43:59.980\n but I think they're trying to tie it to gold once again.\n\n1:43:59.980 --> 1:44:01.660\n So that's an interesting,\n\n1:44:01.660 --> 1:44:04.620\n maybe it'll be one of the more authoritarian regime\n\n1:44:04.620 --> 1:44:07.900\n that will switch to Bitcoin standard first.\n\n1:44:07.900 --> 1:44:11.360\n And then it's the West that will,\n\n1:44:11.360 --> 1:44:14.960\n out of that pressure will catch up\n\n1:44:14.960 --> 1:44:17.500\n versus the other way around.\n\n1:44:17.500 --> 1:44:22.500\n It's fascinating to think of what is the forcing function,\n\n1:44:23.120 --> 1:44:26.280\n what kind of perturbation is required to switch,\n\n1:44:26.280 --> 1:44:28.600\n to change anything, honestly, about the financial system.\n\n1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:32.700\n But it could be, as you're saying,\n\n1:44:32.700 --> 1:44:34.960\n just waiting for the people that are young now\n\n1:44:34.960 --> 1:44:36.660\n that are embracing crypto\n\n1:44:36.660 --> 1:44:41.020\n to enter the positions of power, essentially.\n\n1:44:41.020 --> 1:44:42.360\n But I hope that's not the case,\n\n1:44:42.360 --> 1:44:47.360\n because if for any innovation we have to wait,\n\n1:44:47.400 --> 1:44:51.860\n sorry to say, for the older folk to pass away,\n\n1:44:51.860 --> 1:44:54.700\n that's not an efficient way to make change.\n\n1:44:54.700 --> 1:44:57.480\n Yeah, that's a super interesting topic\n\n1:44:57.480 --> 1:45:01.480\n of how people's minds become less plastic as they age.\n\n1:45:02.960 --> 1:45:05.000\n I guess it's a feature.\n\n1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:06.520\n It's called wisdom,\n\n1:45:06.520 --> 1:45:09.120\n but then we also need the wild ones to explore,\n\n1:45:09.120 --> 1:45:11.080\n exploration versus exploitation.\n\n1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:14.480\n You wrote a blog post that's really interesting\n\n1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:16.680\n in September 2020 titled\n\n1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:18.960\n Coinbase is a Mission Focused Company,\n\n1:45:18.960 --> 1:45:20.640\n like what we're talking about.\n\n1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:23.520\n So one interesting thing you said in that blog post\n\n1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:27.540\n is that we're not going to be distracted\n\n1:45:27.540 --> 1:45:31.000\n by activism within the company\n\n1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:35.160\n that's not related to the mission of the company.\n\n1:45:35.160 --> 1:45:38.600\n Now, that's a rare thing for a company to state,\n\n1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:42.320\n for a company CEO to state, especially in this climate.\n\n1:45:44.560 --> 1:45:46.200\n Can you, first of all,\n\n1:45:46.200 --> 1:45:50.320\n describe in a little more detail what you meant?\n\n1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:52.400\n Did you receive blowback for this?\n\n1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:53.620\n I definitely received some blowback,\n\n1:45:53.620 --> 1:45:55.020\n but yeah, I'll describe what I meant.\n\n1:45:55.020 --> 1:45:57.700\n And if you want to talk about how it came to that too,\n\n1:45:57.700 --> 1:45:58.540\n we can talk about that.\n\n1:45:58.540 --> 1:46:03.540\n But what I meant is that there's a lot of companies right now,\n\n1:46:04.040 --> 1:46:06.660\n including tech companies, but not exclusively,\n\n1:46:06.660 --> 1:46:11.440\n where I think like great companies,\n\n1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:12.680\n they have an important mission.\n\n1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:15.080\n They're trying to do something really good for the world.\n\n1:46:15.080 --> 1:46:17.640\n And unfortunately, they're getting a little distracted\n\n1:46:17.640 --> 1:46:20.840\n from that at times because of employee activism\n\n1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:25.320\n that is causing the company to basically jump\n\n1:46:25.320 --> 1:46:26.960\n into whatever the current thing is\n\n1:46:26.960 --> 1:46:30.760\n and try to help is like the positive interpretation.\n\n1:46:30.760 --> 1:46:33.480\n The negative interpretation would be to virtue signal.\n\n1:46:33.480 --> 1:46:38.480\n And my view is that this is actually kind of destructive to,\n\n1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:41.200\n this is largely an American company phenomenon, by the way.\n\n1:46:41.200 --> 1:46:45.640\n I do worry that this is making America less competitive,\n\n1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:46.480\n even though I think of myself\n\n1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:47.820\n as kind of internationally minded,\n\n1:46:47.820 --> 1:46:50.060\n but I am a US citizen, had my whole life here.\n\n1:46:50.060 --> 1:46:54.000\n So when we put out this statement,\n\n1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.020\n we had employees that were not in the US\n\n1:46:56.020 --> 1:46:57.200\n who were confused by it.\n\n1:46:57.200 --> 1:46:59.520\n They were like, why did Brian need to say that?\n\n1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:02.480\n It was just saying you're going to focus on work at work.\n\n1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:04.480\n That's what we were doing already.\n\n1:47:04.480 --> 1:47:08.640\n And there was certain pockets of the US, certain cities,\n\n1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:10.320\n in particular where we had employees\n\n1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:15.320\n that a very peculiar cultural phenomenon had evolved\n\n1:47:15.500 --> 1:47:19.080\n where I think people really wanted the company\n\n1:47:19.080 --> 1:47:24.080\n they worked at to be almost acting\n\n1:47:24.120 --> 1:47:25.240\n like the government or something\n\n1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:28.160\n and like trying to solve the hardest societal issues\n\n1:47:28.160 --> 1:47:30.380\n and at least have an opinion on it,\n\n1:47:30.380 --> 1:47:32.100\n if not contribute to the solution\n\n1:47:32.100 --> 1:47:33.320\n on almost everything.\n\n1:47:35.500 --> 1:47:39.800\n And for me, it was a very uncomfortable situation\n\n1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:40.640\n for me as a CEO.\n\n1:47:40.640 --> 1:47:42.000\n I'd never quite been in this situation\n\n1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:45.040\n where most of the time when employees in the past\n\n1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:47.440\n were kind of asking me questions,\n\n1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:49.560\n they would be asking about like,\n\n1:47:49.560 --> 1:47:50.800\n how do we make this product better?\n\n1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:52.320\n Like, what do we do with this competitor?\n\n1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:53.720\n What about this regulator?\n\n1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:56.680\n And it got to a place around that time\n\n1:47:56.680 --> 1:47:59.380\n where most of the questions we were receiving\n\n1:47:59.380 --> 1:48:02.080\n were I think even about things not related to the company\n\n1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:03.260\n they were about broader societal issues.\n\n1:48:03.260 --> 1:48:06.680\n Like Brian, what's your stance on XYZ controversial thing?\n\n1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:10.560\n And it was, I often like didn't have an opinion\n\n1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:12.120\n on these really hard questions, right?\n\n1:48:12.120 --> 1:48:13.640\n And I didn't really,\n\n1:48:13.640 --> 1:48:15.800\n I felt like it was distracting the company.\n\n1:48:15.800 --> 1:48:17.780\n People internally were getting into fights a lot too,\n\n1:48:17.780 --> 1:48:19.640\n like disagreeing with each other.\n\n1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:22.520\n There was a thing where like the social slack internally\n\n1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:24.160\n was turning into a social media almost\n\n1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:26.360\n with people putting in flame wars.\n\n1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:28.000\n So, and this culminated by the way\n\n1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:31.300\n with a walkout that happened in the company.\n\n1:48:31.300 --> 1:48:34.640\n We had received like some demands from employee groups\n\n1:48:34.640 --> 1:48:35.520\n about various things.\n\n1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:37.680\n And there was like basically an antagonistic thing\n\n1:48:37.680 --> 1:48:38.720\n with management and employee.\n\n1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:41.960\n And I was like, we're all on the same team here.\n\n1:48:41.960 --> 1:48:43.240\n If you wanna be antagonistic,\n\n1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:46.480\n let's do it with somebody else outside the company,\n\n1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:48.480\n that we're trying to improve the world in that dimension.\n\n1:48:48.480 --> 1:48:51.080\n So yeah, eventually I was like, okay,\n\n1:48:51.080 --> 1:48:52.780\n the company is not aligned on this.\n\n1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:56.580\n I just don't feel, I don't like the job as CEO, frankly.\n\n1:48:56.580 --> 1:48:58.840\n Like if the job is to come in here every day\n\n1:48:58.840 --> 1:49:02.040\n and like have to squirm in front of like the most difficult\n\n1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:05.400\n societal questions, I don't think I wanna do that job.\n\n1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:06.720\n So like either they're gonna have to go\n\n1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:08.120\n or I'm gonna have to go.\n\n1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:09.400\n And I founded this company\n\n1:49:09.400 --> 1:49:10.340\n and I really believe in the mission.\n\n1:49:10.340 --> 1:49:11.400\n So they're gonna have to go.\n\n1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:14.140\n And what I realized was that,\n\n1:49:14.140 --> 1:49:16.920\n so I basically, I made an exit package available\n\n1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:19.320\n to anybody who wasn't on board with this direction.\n\n1:49:19.320 --> 1:49:21.180\n 5% of employees took it.\n\n1:49:21.180 --> 1:49:23.900\n I got the company realigned towards this mission.\n\n1:49:23.900 --> 1:49:25.140\n We're all here to do work.\n\n1:49:25.140 --> 1:49:27.460\n By the way, people can, they can go do anything\n\n1:49:27.460 --> 1:49:29.760\n like political or social activism outside of work.\n\n1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:30.600\n It's totally fine.\n\n1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:33.360\n Like we all, everybody has stuff like that\n\n1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:34.260\n in their personal life.\n\n1:49:34.260 --> 1:49:36.360\n But while at work, we can also disagree at work,\n\n1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:37.600\n by the way, on the work.\n\n1:49:37.600 --> 1:49:39.820\n You know, this is not like a no disagreement culture.\n\n1:49:39.820 --> 1:49:42.320\n Like we should, let's try to get the truth.\n\n1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:44.060\n But don't bring stuff into work\n\n1:49:44.060 --> 1:49:46.280\n that's just gonna create division.\n\n1:49:46.280 --> 1:49:48.440\n Make the workplace a refuge from division\n\n1:49:48.440 --> 1:49:49.460\n about all these crazy things.\n\n1:49:49.460 --> 1:49:51.720\n And like, we're all aligned here to work on the mission.\n\n1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:52.640\n Let's do that.\n\n1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:57.240\n Yeah, that was really, really, really refreshing to hear.\n\n1:49:57.240 --> 1:50:00.340\n So this is me speaking, but there's a sense\n\n1:50:00.340 --> 1:50:03.480\n when companies take on these issues publicly\n\n1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:06.120\n from a CEO position or anywhere else,\n\n1:50:06.120 --> 1:50:10.920\n that it does seem to optimize for virtue signaling\n\n1:50:10.920 --> 1:50:13.480\n versus solving a particular problem.\n\n1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:15.620\n Because to solve a particular problem,\n\n1:50:15.620 --> 1:50:18.800\n you really have to really put in a huge,\n\n1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:20.500\n you have to hire a huge number of,\n\n1:50:20.500 --> 1:50:22.940\n you basically have to create a company with a company\n\n1:50:22.940 --> 1:50:25.400\n to take on a particular thing.\n\n1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:29.440\n But if you allow yourself to internally care\n\n1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:30.620\n about a particular issue,\n\n1:50:30.620 --> 1:50:34.240\n you're basically pacifying some number of employee,\n\n1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:37.000\n like making sure Slack doesn't get out of hand.\n\n1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:40.180\n And then you're doing this kind of, from my perspective,\n\n1:50:40.180 --> 1:50:43.780\n especially on issues that care about fake virtue signaling,\n\n1:50:43.780 --> 1:50:45.560\n basically trying to understand\n\n1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:47.240\n what will make me look the best,\n\n1:50:47.240 --> 1:50:48.720\n what would make the company look the best\n\n1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:50.320\n in this particular aspect.\n\n1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:52.120\n And it just seems very shallow.\n\n1:50:52.120 --> 1:50:54.300\n And it's optimizing for the wrong thing,\n\n1:50:54.300 --> 1:50:56.880\n not for the solving of the problems,\n\n1:50:56.880 --> 1:51:01.880\n but for the making yourself look like the good guy\n\n1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:04.940\n and trying to then leverage that to say,\n\n1:51:04.940 --> 1:51:07.520\n I'm the good guy in all situations.\n\n1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:09.760\n And it just, it's the wrong thing.\n\n1:51:09.760 --> 1:51:13.880\n And perhaps from your perspective as a CEO, as a leader,\n\n1:51:13.880 --> 1:51:16.560\n it's also creating division,\n\n1:51:16.560 --> 1:51:19.300\n unnecessary division within people.\n\n1:51:19.300 --> 1:51:21.280\n Like they get, yeah, there's something about us\n\n1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:25.840\n who gets extremely argumentative about certain topics.\n\n1:51:25.840 --> 1:51:28.440\n They really bring out the emotion.\n\n1:51:28.440 --> 1:51:30.880\n And I think that probably, as you were saying,\n\n1:51:30.880 --> 1:51:33.960\n that emotion is even probably okay,\n\n1:51:33.960 --> 1:51:36.060\n maybe productive when that emotion has to do\n\n1:51:36.060 --> 1:51:37.680\n with the mission of the company.\n\n1:51:37.680 --> 1:51:40.440\n Like you really care about those disagreements\n\n1:51:40.440 --> 1:51:43.920\n versus like something that has nothing to do\n\n1:51:43.920 --> 1:51:51.340\n with increasing economic freedom using crypto.\n\n1:51:51.340 --> 1:51:52.720\n Yeah, it's fascinating.\n\n1:51:52.720 --> 1:51:55.440\n But it was so refreshing because it's rare.\n\n1:51:55.440 --> 1:51:57.320\n Why do you think that's a rare?\n\n1:51:57.320 --> 1:51:59.840\n So the city you're mentioning,\n\n1:51:59.840 --> 1:52:01.960\n I mean, there's a bunch of cities,\n\n1:52:01.960 --> 1:52:06.960\n but San Francisco is one such city when that culture.\n\n1:52:07.420 --> 1:52:12.360\n And it's sad because San Francisco is also,\n\n1:52:12.360 --> 1:52:16.680\n the Bay Area is also the hub historically\n\n1:52:16.680 --> 1:52:20.600\n of some of the greatest innovation in human history.\n\n1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:22.040\n So there's that tension.\n\n1:52:22.040 --> 1:52:24.360\n How did that culture emerge there?\n\n1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:27.320\n Where like the innovation was done by people\n\n1:52:27.320 --> 1:52:29.000\n that are very mission driven.\n\n1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:30.800\n You get a bunch of smart people together\n\n1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:32.640\n to solve a difficult problem.\n\n1:52:32.640 --> 1:52:35.680\n They get maybe sometimes too much blinders on,\n\n1:52:35.680 --> 1:52:37.560\n but they try to balance that.\n\n1:52:37.560 --> 1:52:41.400\n Because it requires that focus to solve an actual problem.\n\n1:52:41.400 --> 1:52:44.680\n And yet that's also the place where this culture emerged.\n\n1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:47.280\n It's a fascinating human dynamic.\n\n1:52:47.280 --> 1:52:48.120\n I don't know.\n\n1:52:48.120 --> 1:52:52.400\n Somebody will one day tell the history of Silicon Valley,\n\n1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:54.240\n not just the innovation,\n\n1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:56.160\n but the social dynamics that occurred there.\n\n1:52:56.160 --> 1:52:58.160\n Anyway, why do you think that's so rare?\n\n1:52:59.600 --> 1:53:01.680\n Well, because people don't wanna get attacked.\n\n1:53:01.680 --> 1:53:04.100\n It's like super, you don't wanna get canceled, right?\n\n1:53:04.100 --> 1:53:07.640\n It's super uncomfortable.\n\n1:53:07.640 --> 1:53:08.960\n Nobody wants to be called a racist\n\n1:53:08.960 --> 1:53:11.920\n or whatever people wanna say on Twitter.\n\n1:53:13.320 --> 1:53:14.520\n Did you get attacked?\n\n1:53:14.520 --> 1:53:16.000\n Yeah, yeah, I definitely got attacked.\n\n1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:17.960\n I mean, and I knew it would be controversial.\n\n1:53:17.960 --> 1:53:19.600\n The only reason I did it, frankly,\n\n1:53:19.600 --> 1:53:22.560\n was that I was kind of at my wit's end.\n\n1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:24.760\n I was like, well, like I said earlier,\n\n1:53:24.760 --> 1:53:26.440\n like the job, the CEO job sucks.\n\n1:53:26.440 --> 1:53:29.440\n Like either I don't wanna do it or they have to go\n\n1:53:29.440 --> 1:53:31.300\n and I'm gonna make the company into something that I want.\n\n1:53:31.300 --> 1:53:36.300\n And I'd spent eight or 90 years of my life at that point\n\n1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:37.320\n kind of building this thing.\n\n1:53:37.320 --> 1:53:39.200\n I was like, well, I could go start another company,\n\n1:53:39.200 --> 1:53:41.240\n but it takes a long time to get momentum with these things.\n\n1:53:41.240 --> 1:53:44.440\n And Coinbase is a very rare thing that happened in the world.\n\n1:53:44.440 --> 1:53:46.240\n I feel very passionate about it.\n\n1:53:46.240 --> 1:53:48.800\n So yeah, I'm not gonna go.\n\n1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:51.040\n Like I need to make this the company that I wanna work at.\n\n1:53:51.040 --> 1:53:53.960\n And what was really interesting was that\n\n1:53:53.960 --> 1:53:56.800\n there was such a huge outpouring of support.\n\n1:53:56.800 --> 1:53:58.240\n So I knew that it would be controversial\n\n1:53:58.240 --> 1:53:59.080\n and I would get attacked.\n\n1:53:59.080 --> 1:54:03.000\n And predictably, there was some journalists\n\n1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:04.520\n and New York Times and all these people\n\n1:54:04.520 --> 1:54:06.840\n who kind of like went and started writing hit pieces\n\n1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:09.440\n on the company shortly thereafter.\n\n1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:12.120\n And they basically just call people who've left the company\n\n1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:14.680\n and can get quotes on whatever they want\n\n1:54:14.680 --> 1:54:16.320\n and then they'll write a story.\n\n1:54:16.320 --> 1:54:18.600\n So mainstream media, I lost a lot of trust\n\n1:54:18.600 --> 1:54:20.000\n in mainstream media, frankly, after that.\n\n1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.720\n And of course, it's kind of become obvious since then\n\n1:54:22.720 --> 1:54:25.960\n that most mainstream media is like hyper politicized\n\n1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:26.800\n at this point.\n\n1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:28.560\n It's basically either super left or super right.\n\n1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:33.040\n And it's not really that focused on truth.\n\n1:54:33.040 --> 1:54:35.600\n So that's kind of unfortunate\n\n1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:37.480\n because I think journalism is actually like really important\n\n1:54:37.480 --> 1:54:38.320\n in society.\n\n1:54:38.320 --> 1:54:40.800\n So that whole thing got eroded in the US.\n\n1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:43.400\n Luckily, there's sort of new media, people like you\n\n1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:44.720\n and a whole bunch of people.\n\n1:54:44.720 --> 1:54:47.680\n Did that blog post help that statement,\n\n1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:50.600\n the 95 people that remained,\n\n1:54:50.600 --> 1:54:52.560\n is this still something you struggle with?\n\n1:54:52.560 --> 1:54:56.660\n Because it's also a culture of the broader tech space.\n\n1:54:56.660 --> 1:54:58.880\n Okay, so that was an interesting thing, which was that,\n\n1:54:58.880 --> 1:55:00.720\n so the 95% of people stayed.\n\n1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:05.080\n I got a huge outpouring of support from people who said,\n\n1:55:05.080 --> 1:55:07.280\n thank God you finally spoke up and said something\n\n1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:10.920\n because frankly, it was making it not a very fun place\n\n1:55:10.920 --> 1:55:12.320\n to work either.\n\n1:55:12.320 --> 1:55:16.280\n And I realized that there is, I think there was,\n\n1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:19.040\n I think Nassim Taleb has this blog post\n\n1:55:19.040 --> 1:55:22.400\n about the tyranny of the 1% or something like that.\n\n1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:24.040\n But there's basically a relatively small group,\n\n1:55:24.040 --> 1:55:25.560\n one in 5% or something like that,\n\n1:55:25.560 --> 1:55:28.400\n that is really upset about something.\n\n1:55:28.400 --> 1:55:30.880\n It's not the majority of the company, it's like 5%.\n\n1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:33.540\n There's another 15% or something that are sympathetic\n\n1:55:33.540 --> 1:55:34.440\n to the cause.\n\n1:55:34.440 --> 1:55:35.980\n They're actually somewhat suggestible.\n\n1:55:35.980 --> 1:55:37.560\n They will go along with whatever,\n\n1:55:37.560 --> 1:55:38.720\n because it sounds reasonable.\n\n1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:40.400\n These are like real issues they're talking about.\n\n1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:42.660\n It's not to say that it's not real.\n\n1:55:42.660 --> 1:55:44.940\n And they'll kind of get swept up in it.\n\n1:55:44.940 --> 1:55:48.520\n But there's an 80% of the company that basically\n\n1:55:48.520 --> 1:55:50.400\n doesn't agree or just wants to get their work done\n\n1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:52.920\n without all this drama or distraction.\n\n1:55:52.920 --> 1:55:56.640\n And they're afraid to speak up because if they speak up,\n\n1:55:56.640 --> 1:55:58.800\n they're afraid of being, again, called a racist,\n\n1:55:58.800 --> 1:56:01.960\n like fired, ostracized amongst their peers.\n\n1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:06.640\n And so it did require it to get to a bad enough place\n\n1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:07.800\n for me to finally say, you know what?\n\n1:56:07.800 --> 1:56:10.120\n I just, I feel like I have to do this.\n\n1:56:10.120 --> 1:56:12.600\n Live through the short term attacks of the press,\n\n1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:14.340\n which ultimately was very freeing for me\n\n1:56:14.340 --> 1:56:16.360\n because now I don't really care.\n\n1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:18.120\n And now I can actually just build the company\n\n1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:21.560\n that I want to build without caring about that.\n\n1:56:21.560 --> 1:56:24.200\n And then what was cool was a lot of really great people\n\n1:56:24.200 --> 1:56:25.980\n reached out to the Coinbase too after that.\n\n1:56:25.980 --> 1:56:29.740\n And were like, I'm an early engineer at Google or wherever.\n\n1:56:29.740 --> 1:56:33.040\n And this culture has gotten kind of messed up\n\n1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:34.260\n and I want to work at a company\n\n1:56:34.260 --> 1:56:35.280\n that's willing to stand for that.\n\n1:56:35.280 --> 1:56:37.420\n And so we've gotten a lot of good people come over.\n\n1:56:37.420 --> 1:56:38.960\n Basically what I realized, and by the way,\n\n1:56:38.960 --> 1:56:40.560\n our diversity numbers and all that stuff,\n\n1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:43.160\n people told me when I was drafting this poster,\n\n1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:46.280\n don't post this, people, underrepresented groups\n\n1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:47.880\n will never want to work at this company again.\n\n1:56:47.880 --> 1:56:49.960\n And I was like, I don't think that's true.\n\n1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:53.460\n I talked to our ERG groups and they're not telling me\n\n1:56:53.460 --> 1:56:54.880\n they care about this stuff that much.\n\n1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:57.200\n They're telling me they just want to be respected at work\n\n1:56:57.200 --> 1:56:58.880\n and do good work and contribute.\n\n1:56:58.880 --> 1:57:01.640\n So my gut was telling me that that advice was wrong.\n\n1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:05.040\n And I can tell you a year after doing it,\n\n1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:07.200\n our diversity numbers are basically either the same\n\n1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:08.880\n or better in every category.\n\n1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:10.320\n So that turned out to be false.\n\n1:57:12.340 --> 1:57:17.340\n Look, I hate to be polarizing on either dimension here.\n\n1:57:17.440 --> 1:57:18.560\n I just want to get good work done\n\n1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:20.000\n and build good stuff with technology.\n\n1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:25.000\n So I think companies should just have reasonable policies.\n\n1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:27.320\n You want to get rid of bias in hiring.\n\n1:57:27.320 --> 1:57:29.640\n You want to attract great people from all\n\n1:57:29.640 --> 1:57:31.520\n different backgrounds.\n\n1:57:31.520 --> 1:57:32.840\n We have pledge 1%.\n\n1:57:32.840 --> 1:57:35.080\n We put 1% of the company equity into a foundation.\n\n1:57:35.080 --> 1:57:36.800\n I hope we're able to do good stuff with that.\n\n1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:39.080\n Let's give back in some way.\n\n1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:44.080\n But the main message I guess for me is the core mission,\n\n1:57:46.280 --> 1:57:48.200\n the core work that we're doing on economic freedom\n\n1:57:48.200 --> 1:57:49.940\n and just all of our products,\n\n1:57:49.940 --> 1:57:52.440\n that is the main value that we're contributing in the world.\n\n1:57:52.440 --> 1:57:53.480\n Let's just do that more.\n\n1:57:53.480 --> 1:57:56.520\n And hopefully we can get from 89 million verified users\n\n1:57:56.520 --> 1:57:58.100\n to a billion or whatever.\n\n1:57:58.100 --> 1:58:01.200\n And then I just think that's how we'll have\n\n1:58:01.200 --> 1:58:02.240\n the biggest impact.\n\n1:58:02.240 --> 1:58:03.400\n It's tempting though.\n\n1:58:03.400 --> 1:58:06.380\n It's so interesting how companies get tempted to help.\n\n1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:10.160\n And you step in and it's almost like a drug\n\n1:58:10.160 --> 1:58:11.880\n and then you can't, you forget.\n\n1:58:11.880 --> 1:58:14.740\n I mean, like all of us in life just have to be companies.\n\n1:58:14.740 --> 1:58:18.720\n You get distracted and maintaining focus.\n\n1:58:18.720 --> 1:58:19.760\n You're absolutely right.\n\n1:58:19.760 --> 1:58:22.060\n The way for Coinbase to add value to the world\n\n1:58:22.060 --> 1:58:25.160\n is to maximize the mission that it's on,\n\n1:58:25.160 --> 1:58:27.320\n not other stuff.\n\n1:58:27.320 --> 1:58:29.880\n And when you get wealthier and more successful,\n\n1:58:29.880 --> 1:58:31.920\n it becomes more and more tempting\n\n1:58:31.920 --> 1:58:34.320\n to just help out in some other shallow ways.\n\n1:58:35.160 --> 1:58:36.000\n It's fascinating.\n\n1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:37.520\n And you just kind of brought that to light.\n\n1:58:37.520 --> 1:58:38.700\n So it was very refreshing.\n\n1:58:38.700 --> 1:58:40.240\n And it shouldn't be controversial\n\n1:58:40.240 --> 1:58:43.960\n to sort of focus on just getting stuff done.\n\n1:58:43.960 --> 1:58:44.780\n Well, let me ask you,\n\n1:58:44.780 --> 1:58:46.200\n I mean, do you think that this,\n\n1:58:46.200 --> 1:58:47.620\n it's all these things tie together.\n\n1:58:47.620 --> 1:58:50.540\n There's like a general trend of like more censorship.\n\n1:58:50.540 --> 1:58:52.980\n There's like more cancel culture.\n\n1:58:52.980 --> 1:58:57.320\n There's some of these like freedom values\n\n1:58:57.320 --> 1:59:00.700\n are kind of, even like freezing people's accounts,\n\n1:59:00.700 --> 1:59:02.500\n like the trucker thing that happened.\n\n1:59:02.500 --> 1:59:05.080\n And this seems like there's a general trend\n\n1:59:05.080 --> 1:59:10.080\n of more authoritarian policies there.\n\n1:59:10.820 --> 1:59:13.940\n But do you feel like the tide is turning on that?\n\n1:59:13.940 --> 1:59:17.100\n Like there's counter examples to it we've seen recently.\n\n1:59:17.100 --> 1:59:20.920\n I think it's the last gasp of old way of doing things.\n\n1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:22.940\n And so there's desperation and so on.\n\n1:59:22.940 --> 1:59:27.100\n Because to be fair, it's kind of the internet,\n\n1:59:27.100 --> 1:59:29.660\n which is where's the source of a lot of this,\n\n1:59:29.660 --> 1:59:31.180\n where people have a voice,\n\n1:59:31.180 --> 1:59:34.300\n is making the power centers of the world really nervous.\n\n1:59:34.300 --> 1:59:36.580\n And so that's where that's coming from, I think.\n\n1:59:36.580 --> 1:59:38.780\n And the internet is tricky.\n\n1:59:38.780 --> 1:59:39.980\n It's weird.\n\n1:59:39.980 --> 1:59:41.660\n It's full of bots.\n\n1:59:41.660 --> 1:59:45.820\n It's full of like misinformation of all kinds,\n\n1:59:45.820 --> 1:59:49.860\n full of large groups with conspiracy theories and so on.\n\n1:59:49.860 --> 1:59:51.580\n And I mean misinformation broadly.\n\n1:59:51.580 --> 1:59:53.780\n People are misusing the word misinformation.\n\n1:59:53.780 --> 1:59:56.200\n They're just, governments are just labeling\n\n1:59:56.200 --> 1:59:59.020\n random things with misinformation just to censor them.\n\n1:59:59.900 --> 2:00:03.540\n But I just think it's just like a new world\n\n2:00:03.540 --> 2:00:06.100\n where the internet is really finally taking hold,\n\n2:00:06.100 --> 2:00:07.600\n where there's billions of devices\n\n2:00:07.600 --> 2:00:09.260\n and everybody has a voice.\n\n2:00:09.260 --> 2:00:14.260\n It's almost, basically governments and powerful people\n\n2:00:15.900 --> 2:00:18.420\n are slightly losing hold of power.\n\n2:00:18.420 --> 2:00:20.540\n And they're starting to freak out a little bit.\n\n2:00:20.540 --> 2:00:21.420\n That's it.\n\n2:00:21.420 --> 2:00:25.620\n And once you have young people that are coming up now,\n\n2:00:25.620 --> 2:00:28.660\n gain power, I think we'll rebalance everything.\n\n2:00:28.660 --> 2:00:30.420\n And then there's, like you said,\n\n2:00:30.420 --> 2:00:34.820\n promising signs that it's obvious\n\n2:00:34.820 --> 2:00:38.180\n that the majority of people want freedom.\n\n2:00:38.180 --> 2:00:39.420\n And that means a lot of things.\n\n2:00:39.420 --> 2:00:40.620\n That means economic freedom.\n\n2:00:40.620 --> 2:00:43.000\n That means freedom to have a voice,\n\n2:00:44.380 --> 2:00:45.620\n freedom to move around,\n\n2:00:45.620 --> 2:00:47.940\n freedom to act in the way they,\n\n2:00:47.940 --> 2:00:52.940\n without reasonable sort of limitations\n\n2:00:53.220 --> 2:00:55.020\n by people that don't have their best interests.\n\n2:00:55.020 --> 2:00:59.700\n And I gain more hope from just regular people\n\n2:00:59.700 --> 2:01:04.340\n that are fighting and like demanding\n\n2:01:05.820 --> 2:01:08.620\n being able to have freedom of speech,\n\n2:01:08.620 --> 2:01:11.220\n or more specifically sort of resisting\n\n2:01:12.260 --> 2:01:16.460\n crude overreach of government in the acts of censorship,\n\n2:01:16.460 --> 2:01:18.020\n at least in the United States.\n\n2:01:19.780 --> 2:01:22.640\n And hopefully that percolates out to the rest of the world\n\n2:01:22.640 --> 2:01:25.340\n that's struggling on a much more basic level\n\n2:01:25.340 --> 2:01:27.780\n where people are being put in prison for the words they say,\n\n2:01:27.780 --> 2:01:30.060\n not just banned from Twitter.\n\n2:01:30.060 --> 2:01:31.500\n Right, it could be worse.\n\n2:01:31.500 --> 2:01:36.500\n What are some lessons from your failures and your successes\n\n2:01:37.660 --> 2:01:40.080\n about what it takes to run a company?\n\n2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:43.740\n I think one of the things that I learned about leadership\n\n2:01:43.740 --> 2:01:47.260\n is that I never really thought of myself\n\n2:01:47.260 --> 2:01:48.860\n as a very natural leader, to be honest.\n\n2:01:48.860 --> 2:01:51.580\n I don't think I was a natural leader.\n\n2:01:51.580 --> 2:01:54.060\n But so I always envisioned good leaders\n\n2:01:54.060 --> 2:01:55.500\n as like these military generals,\n\n2:01:55.500 --> 2:01:58.980\n like they seem so confident and they're just like bark orders,\n\n2:01:58.980 --> 2:02:00.360\n charge that hill and do this.\n\n2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:03.260\n And I was actually like more introverted\n\n2:02:03.260 --> 2:02:06.720\n and kind of, I wasn't really confident\n\n2:02:06.720 --> 2:02:07.980\n in the way I communicated.\n\n2:02:09.300 --> 2:02:11.940\n And so what I realized is that\n\n2:02:11.940 --> 2:02:13.140\n there's lots of different kinds of leaders.\n\n2:02:13.140 --> 2:02:15.020\n You can be any kind of CEO you want, right?\n\n2:02:15.020 --> 2:02:18.180\n I was kind of more of like a product, technical focus CEO.\n\n2:02:18.180 --> 2:02:21.720\n And I preferred to sort of hear everyone's opinion.\n\n2:02:21.720 --> 2:02:23.780\n And it wasn't just gonna like render a decision in the room\n\n2:02:23.780 --> 2:02:25.100\n in some like kind of heated moment\n\n2:02:25.100 --> 2:02:26.260\n and like piss off half the people.\n\n2:02:26.260 --> 2:02:28.380\n I would do like, all right, I'm gonna go think about it\n\n2:02:28.380 --> 2:02:30.660\n and I'll send you my decision later today\n\n2:02:30.660 --> 2:02:32.140\n or tomorrow or whatever.\n\n2:02:32.140 --> 2:02:35.040\n And so I found ways to kind of make it work for me\n\n2:02:35.040 --> 2:02:38.600\n where I could basically, I always tried to avoid like,\n\n2:02:40.420 --> 2:02:42.580\n when people getting like super emotional about something\n\n2:02:42.580 --> 2:02:44.540\n and like, I think they're thinking,\n\n2:02:44.540 --> 2:02:46.460\n their judgment goes down, right?\n\n2:02:46.460 --> 2:02:48.460\n And just like never make a decision when you're angry, right?\n\n2:02:48.460 --> 2:02:50.960\n And so I would always sort of try to get a sense of,\n\n2:02:50.960 --> 2:02:52.260\n are these people like trying to be right\n\n2:02:52.260 --> 2:02:54.640\n or are they trying to seek the truth?\n\n2:02:54.640 --> 2:02:57.260\n And you can do these little tricks like,\n\n2:02:57.260 --> 2:02:59.380\n okay, you argue that person's position\n\n2:02:59.380 --> 2:03:00.380\n and you argue the other one\n\n2:03:00.380 --> 2:03:02.840\n and like see if you can genuinely represent it.\n\n2:03:02.840 --> 2:03:05.420\n Now I know you're listening and these kinds of things.\n\n2:03:06.300 --> 2:03:07.140\n But I guess, sorry,\n\n2:03:07.140 --> 2:03:08.540\n getting back to your question about leadership,\n\n2:03:08.540 --> 2:03:12.160\n I think I basically just kept doing things\n\n2:03:12.160 --> 2:03:15.140\n that were a little outside my comfort zone.\n\n2:03:15.140 --> 2:03:17.780\n And then my comfort zone kept getting bigger and bigger.\n\n2:03:17.780 --> 2:03:18.600\n You know?\n\n2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:22.060\n And so I think that's how you build confidence\n\n2:03:22.060 --> 2:03:24.940\n is you do the thing that's scary\n\n2:03:24.940 --> 2:03:26.820\n and it's like a little outside.\n\n2:03:26.820 --> 2:03:29.100\n And like when I first started Coinbase,\n\n2:03:29.100 --> 2:03:30.220\n I had never managed anybody.\n\n2:03:30.220 --> 2:03:32.060\n I would have been scared to death\n\n2:03:32.060 --> 2:03:34.660\n to have put out like a very controversial opinion like that\n\n2:03:34.660 --> 2:03:38.340\n and sort of, all right, 5% of people will go,\n\n2:03:38.340 --> 2:03:39.540\n we didn't know what percent it was gonna be by the way.\n\n2:03:39.540 --> 2:03:41.340\n It could have been 1%, it could have been 50%.\n\n2:03:41.340 --> 2:03:44.100\n Like, but we went into it scary\n\n2:03:44.100 --> 2:03:45.220\n because it was a scary thing.\n\n2:03:45.220 --> 2:03:47.540\n I was like, I don't know, I think this is right.\n\n2:03:47.540 --> 2:03:49.420\n I'm just gonna do it.\n\n2:03:49.420 --> 2:03:50.940\n So if you do enough scary things,\n\n2:03:50.940 --> 2:03:52.820\n like you'll build the confidence.\n\n2:03:52.820 --> 2:03:54.540\n And I feel like I'm still on that journey.\n\n2:03:54.540 --> 2:03:57.060\n Every year or two at Coinbase,\n\n2:03:57.060 --> 2:03:58.700\n there's some big thing that comes out as like,\n\n2:03:58.700 --> 2:04:00.620\n oh my God, like I didn't sleep well for a week\n\n2:04:00.620 --> 2:04:03.580\n and like, this is the next level, right?\n\n2:04:03.580 --> 2:04:05.580\n But that's how you learn and grow.\n\n2:04:05.580 --> 2:04:07.500\n So you're still going up that mountain\n\n2:04:07.500 --> 2:04:09.340\n through the fog one step at a time.\n\n2:04:09.340 --> 2:04:10.580\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:10.580 --> 2:04:13.980\n Can I just quickly ask you about a couple of other efforts\n\n2:04:13.980 --> 2:04:15.860\n that are super interesting that you're involved with?\n\n2:04:15.860 --> 2:04:18.900\n So first of all, a little bit more old school,\n\n2:04:18.900 --> 2:04:20.660\n fascinating effort of research hub.\n\n2:04:22.340 --> 2:04:26.980\n So what's that about the GitHub for open science?\n\n2:04:26.980 --> 2:04:28.740\n Yeah, okay, so basically I've had a chance\n\n2:04:28.740 --> 2:04:30.100\n to try to help a couple other companies\n\n2:04:30.100 --> 2:04:30.940\n get off the ground too,\n\n2:04:30.940 --> 2:04:34.620\n cause I wanna see various efforts out there succeed.\n\n2:04:34.620 --> 2:04:37.180\n And one of them I've always thought about\n\n2:04:37.180 --> 2:04:39.820\n like why is scientific research\n\n2:04:39.820 --> 2:04:41.260\n not more like open source software\n\n2:04:41.260 --> 2:04:42.700\n or why couldn't it be much faster, right?\n\n2:04:42.700 --> 2:04:44.780\n And there's, you've probably have seen this\n\n2:04:44.780 --> 2:04:46.020\n like in an academic setting, right?\n\n2:04:46.020 --> 2:04:48.980\n But there's all kinds of things that feel very antiquated\n\n2:04:48.980 --> 2:04:50.500\n to me about scientific research,\n\n2:04:50.500 --> 2:04:53.700\n everything from the funding process and grants\n\n2:04:53.700 --> 2:04:57.620\n to how peer review works, to how you submit to journals,\n\n2:04:57.620 --> 2:05:00.020\n all the costs associated with journals,\n\n2:05:00.020 --> 2:05:01.220\n you know, that the people,\n\n2:05:01.220 --> 2:05:02.940\n you'd think like you'd get paid for this or something\n\n2:05:02.940 --> 2:05:05.140\n and it would then be available to all the taxpayers for free\n\n2:05:05.140 --> 2:05:06.700\n but no, they're like, they're all pay walled\n\n2:05:06.700 --> 2:05:08.100\n and there's like these big companies\n\n2:05:08.100 --> 2:05:09.820\n that have sort of, in my view,\n\n2:05:09.820 --> 2:05:12.020\n kind of held back innovation here.\n\n2:05:12.020 --> 2:05:14.940\n So, and the preprint servers like bioarchive\n\n2:05:14.940 --> 2:05:16.580\n and archive.org have really helped this\n\n2:05:16.580 --> 2:05:17.700\n but those websites are,\n\n2:05:17.700 --> 2:05:19.820\n they look like they're kind of from like 15 years ago\n\n2:05:19.820 --> 2:05:20.660\n or something.\n\n2:05:20.660 --> 2:05:21.700\n Yeah, it's like Craigslist or something.\n\n2:05:21.700 --> 2:05:24.780\n Yeah, so anyway, one of the things I,\n\n2:05:24.780 --> 2:05:26.300\n once Coinbase went public last year,\n\n2:05:26.300 --> 2:05:27.580\n I had a little bit of liquidity and I was like,\n\n2:05:27.580 --> 2:05:28.900\n all right, let me fund a small team\n\n2:05:28.900 --> 2:05:30.540\n and let's see if we can,\n\n2:05:30.540 --> 2:05:32.700\n if they can like go off and make something better here.\n\n2:05:32.700 --> 2:05:35.140\n So we have a prototype out there,\n\n2:05:35.140 --> 2:05:37.380\n it's at researchhub.com, people can check it out.\n\n2:05:37.380 --> 2:05:39.700\n And it's basically, you know,\n\n2:05:39.700 --> 2:05:41.540\n the first version is kind of like Reddit for science.\n\n2:05:41.540 --> 2:05:44.500\n There's like various hubs, which are like journals,\n\n2:05:44.500 --> 2:05:46.460\n but you know, you can publish papers there,\n\n2:05:46.460 --> 2:05:48.260\n you can use an electronic lab notebook\n\n2:05:48.260 --> 2:05:49.740\n to sort of have a modern day paper,\n\n2:05:49.740 --> 2:05:51.540\n which is not just a PDF that's static,\n\n2:05:51.540 --> 2:05:53.580\n but it's a living document.\n\n2:05:53.580 --> 2:05:54.460\n Ideally in the future, you know,\n\n2:05:54.460 --> 2:05:56.580\n you can get comments and feedback from people in there,\n\n2:05:56.580 --> 2:05:57.980\n you can update it over time.\n\n2:05:57.980 --> 2:06:00.180\n We want people to be able to share the code\n\n2:06:00.180 --> 2:06:02.100\n and the data sets associated with their paper,\n\n2:06:02.100 --> 2:06:05.020\n research paper is not just a PDF.\n\n2:06:05.020 --> 2:06:07.020\n And in the future, we want to make it even where like,\n\n2:06:07.020 --> 2:06:09.860\n you know, people can get funding for science\n\n2:06:09.860 --> 2:06:13.660\n through that site and even license out innovations\n\n2:06:13.660 --> 2:06:14.500\n that they've made.\n\n2:06:14.500 --> 2:06:16.380\n Because the other thing I've noticed in life\n\n2:06:16.380 --> 2:06:17.940\n is that there's kind of like,\n\n2:06:17.940 --> 2:06:19.220\n there's a bunch of people working on science\n\n2:06:19.220 --> 2:06:21.100\n and there's a bunch of people building companies\n\n2:06:21.100 --> 2:06:23.340\n and they very rarely intersect,\n\n2:06:23.340 --> 2:06:25.180\n but when they do, you get the best things\n\n2:06:25.180 --> 2:06:28.020\n like SpaceX and Genentech and even Google\n\n2:06:28.020 --> 2:06:31.020\n and like even Coinbase was based on a research paper,\n\n2:06:31.020 --> 2:06:32.460\n the Bitcoin white paper.\n\n2:06:32.460 --> 2:06:35.300\n And so most business people are like creating companies\n\n2:06:35.300 --> 2:06:36.780\n that don't have any scientific innovation,\n\n2:06:36.780 --> 2:06:40.220\n they're just like marketing based on, you know, whatever.\n\n2:06:40.220 --> 2:06:42.740\n And then a lot of scientists are making things\n\n2:06:42.740 --> 2:06:44.740\n which never actually benefit humanity\n\n2:06:44.740 --> 2:06:47.540\n because they're not commercialized and turned into products.\n\n2:06:47.540 --> 2:06:50.660\n And so if we can somehow create a translation layer\n\n2:06:50.660 --> 2:06:53.300\n between those two groups and help them,\n\n2:06:53.300 --> 2:06:56.260\n you know, helps align the market forces,\n\n2:06:56.260 --> 2:06:58.100\n align scientific research to market forces\n\n2:06:58.100 --> 2:06:59.140\n so that they're more incentivized.\n\n2:06:59.140 --> 2:07:01.740\n Like if you discover CRISPR or something like that,\n\n2:07:01.740 --> 2:07:03.220\n like you should be a billionaire, you know,\n\n2:07:03.220 --> 2:07:05.500\n and like all the downstream implications of that,\n\n2:07:05.500 --> 2:07:07.820\n not going through some antiquated tech transfer office\n\n2:07:07.820 --> 2:07:08.660\n or whatever.\n\n2:07:08.660 --> 2:07:11.140\n And if you're an entrepreneur,\n\n2:07:11.140 --> 2:07:12.540\n you should be looking to commercialize\n\n2:07:12.540 --> 2:07:14.740\n the latest scientific innovations.\n\n2:07:14.740 --> 2:07:17.020\n And so that's kind of like the longterm vision\n\n2:07:17.020 --> 2:07:18.660\n for that site.\n\n2:07:18.660 --> 2:07:20.180\n I think it's just an early step today,\n\n2:07:20.180 --> 2:07:22.540\n but we've got like a really passionate community on there\n\n2:07:22.540 --> 2:07:24.780\n that are jumping into like, you know,\n\n2:07:24.780 --> 2:07:29.700\n computer science or longevity or various bio hubs\n\n2:07:29.700 --> 2:07:31.780\n or whatever and like beginning to source\n\n2:07:31.780 --> 2:07:34.620\n the best innovations, but also discuss them, improve them\n\n2:07:34.620 --> 2:07:36.220\n and publish through the site.\n\n2:07:36.220 --> 2:07:38.220\n So I have a question about incentives,\n\n2:07:38.220 --> 2:07:39.980\n but first let me say for people listening\n\n2:07:39.980 --> 2:07:42.660\n who are outside of academia might not be familiar\n\n2:07:42.660 --> 2:07:44.260\n with an absurd situation.\n\n2:07:44.260 --> 2:07:47.220\n So there's journals, like you mentioned,\n\n2:07:47.220 --> 2:07:51.620\n and scientists publishing those journals\n\n2:07:51.620 --> 2:07:56.300\n and the journals provide very little value\n\n2:07:56.300 --> 2:08:00.620\n except matching you with reviewers that are unpaid.\n\n2:08:00.620 --> 2:08:05.540\n And so in the digital world,\n\n2:08:05.540 --> 2:08:07.460\n they're providing basically almost no value\n\n2:08:07.460 --> 2:08:09.060\n except hosting your paper.\n\n2:08:10.300 --> 2:08:15.300\n And they put up a paywall and charge people to access that.\n\n2:08:15.580 --> 2:08:18.500\n And that charge is not like even Netflix fees,\n\n2:08:18.500 --> 2:08:20.860\n you're talking about a lot of money.\n\n2:08:20.860 --> 2:08:24.060\n So they're basically blocking your research\n\n2:08:24.060 --> 2:08:27.060\n that should be wide open from the world\n\n2:08:27.060 --> 2:08:28.220\n and creating a paywall.\n\n2:08:28.220 --> 2:08:32.860\n It's a fascinating like scam that's actually holding back.\n\n2:08:32.860 --> 2:08:34.620\n I don't, it's a shitty scam\n\n2:08:34.620 --> 2:08:37.300\n because you're not making that much money.\n\n2:08:37.300 --> 2:08:38.780\n I feel like a definition of a scam,\n\n2:08:38.780 --> 2:08:40.780\n you should at least be making money.\n\n2:08:40.780 --> 2:08:42.140\n So like significant amount of money,\n\n2:08:42.140 --> 2:08:44.380\n you're basically making shady money\n\n2:08:44.380 --> 2:08:46.860\n and holding back all of human knowledge, okay.\n\n2:08:46.860 --> 2:08:49.220\n So that put aside and people get a little confused\n\n2:08:49.220 --> 2:08:53.420\n because the journals aren't the ones paying the scientists.\n\n2:08:53.420 --> 2:08:55.820\n People think like the journals are somehow\n\n2:08:55.820 --> 2:08:59.980\n funding the scientists, therefore they have the right\n\n2:08:59.980 --> 2:09:01.140\n to put up a paywall.\n\n2:09:01.140 --> 2:09:03.500\n No, no, no, the funding is coming from elsewhere.\n\n2:09:03.500 --> 2:09:07.060\n Journals are the middleman that nobody asks for,\n\n2:09:07.060 --> 2:09:08.220\n especially in the digital world.\n\n2:09:08.220 --> 2:09:13.220\n Anyway, that said, there is a interesting kind of incentives\n\n2:09:13.500 --> 2:09:16.100\n for scientists, which is prestige and so on.\n\n2:09:16.100 --> 2:09:20.060\n So there's a thing with journals,\n\n2:09:20.060 --> 2:09:22.300\n if there's a prestigious journal\n\n2:09:22.300 --> 2:09:26.660\n and you pass the review process, you get into that journal\n\n2:09:26.660 --> 2:09:29.780\n or a prestigious conference in computer science,\n\n2:09:29.780 --> 2:09:33.420\n then that's seen as a good thing in your resume.\n\n2:09:33.420 --> 2:09:36.100\n And, oh, not just your resume, within your community,\n\n2:09:36.100 --> 2:09:37.380\n that's a respected thing.\n\n2:09:37.380 --> 2:09:40.700\n Is there some way to achieve that same kind of incentive\n\n2:09:40.700 --> 2:09:44.740\n in the open setting of research hub?\n\n2:09:44.740 --> 2:09:49.480\n So like where I could say, I got X, Y and Z,\n\n2:09:49.480 --> 2:09:50.820\n like, look, I'm impressive\n\n2:09:50.820 --> 2:09:52.680\n because this happened on research hub.\n\n2:09:52.680 --> 2:09:53.520\n I think you're right.\n\n2:09:53.520 --> 2:09:56.920\n Like the whole academia, like progress track\n\n2:09:56.920 --> 2:09:58.900\n is about like where you got published\n\n2:09:58.900 --> 2:09:59.840\n and how many citations.\n\n2:09:59.840 --> 2:10:04.240\n And it's kind of like a false economy of reputation\n\n2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:06.900\n because like, there's not real money backing it.\n\n2:10:06.900 --> 2:10:10.220\n And so I think we've thought about this a little bit.\n\n2:10:10.220 --> 2:10:12.180\n And I think the research hub team has an opportunity\n\n2:10:12.180 --> 2:10:14.860\n to do something here that basically says like,\n\n2:10:14.860 --> 2:10:18.060\n okay, I had the top paper for 2022\n\n2:10:18.060 --> 2:10:21.580\n in biology on in here.\n\n2:10:21.580 --> 2:10:23.220\n And you basically publish a list,\n\n2:10:23.220 --> 2:10:26.180\n a leaderboards of these like top for the month,\n\n2:10:26.180 --> 2:10:29.180\n the year in all these different categories.\n\n2:10:29.180 --> 2:10:31.820\n Then actually, we should probably give out grants\n\n2:10:31.820 --> 2:10:34.500\n and awards in addition to that,\n\n2:10:34.500 --> 2:10:36.340\n fund those people almost like fellows\n\n2:10:36.340 --> 2:10:40.100\n or even give out like, you know how like the Nobel prize,\n\n2:10:40.100 --> 2:10:42.080\n there should be like a research hub prize or something\n\n2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:43.940\n and like ship people,\n\n2:10:43.940 --> 2:10:47.740\n maybe even ship like a print version of a journal\n\n2:10:47.740 --> 2:10:50.260\n that is the top papers in each category\n\n2:10:50.260 --> 2:10:51.260\n in each month or whatever.\n\n2:10:51.260 --> 2:10:53.060\n And then like people want to put that in their wall\n\n2:10:53.060 --> 2:10:53.900\n and in the lab.\n\n2:10:53.900 --> 2:10:57.580\n And like, so I do think we need to sort of change,\n\n2:10:57.580 --> 2:10:59.980\n I don't know, like the traditional folks in academia\n\n2:10:59.980 --> 2:11:02.540\n or science would probably think this is like crazy idea.\n\n2:11:02.540 --> 2:11:04.580\n But I think we need to change the culture\n\n2:11:04.580 --> 2:11:09.360\n to not celebrate getting published in paywall journals,\n\n2:11:09.360 --> 2:11:11.420\n almost like friends don't let friends publish\n\n2:11:11.420 --> 2:11:14.140\n in like paywall journals.\n\n2:11:14.140 --> 2:11:16.500\n Like, cause that's, it's just not helping humanity.\n\n2:11:16.500 --> 2:11:19.060\n So like, you know, it should be more prestigious\n\n2:11:19.060 --> 2:11:23.940\n to publish in an open science way and get the top spot.\n\n2:11:23.940 --> 2:11:25.740\n That should be celebrated above being published\n\n2:11:25.740 --> 2:11:27.540\n in whatever, I don't even want to name one of them,\n\n2:11:27.540 --> 2:11:28.380\n you know?\n\n2:11:28.380 --> 2:11:30.100\n Well, there's currently,\n\n2:11:30.100 --> 2:11:31.300\n the culture has already shifted\n\n2:11:31.300 --> 2:11:33.660\n to where almost everybody publishes on archive\n\n2:11:33.660 --> 2:11:34.900\n and by archive and so on.\n\n2:11:34.900 --> 2:11:36.100\n Yeah.\n\n2:11:36.100 --> 2:11:39.740\n But, so that the culture is there on that scene,\n\n2:11:39.740 --> 2:11:42.400\n friends don't let friends not publish open,\n\n2:11:42.400 --> 2:11:44.700\n but then the prestige thing is missing,\n\n2:11:44.700 --> 2:11:48.020\n which is like anyone can publish an archive.\n\n2:11:48.020 --> 2:11:50.040\n So how do you know it's actually a strong paper?\n\n2:11:50.040 --> 2:11:55.000\n Now, funny enough, even with the crappy systems we have now,\n\n2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:56.580\n word of mouth is powerful.\n\n2:11:56.580 --> 2:12:00.280\n Like you have a, like citation system is pretty powerful.\n\n2:12:00.280 --> 2:12:02.700\n So like you say, okay, this is a strong paper.\n\n2:12:02.700 --> 2:12:06.180\n We don't need reviewers, our human eyes are the reviewers,\n\n2:12:06.180 --> 2:12:08.540\n like the community is the reviewers.\n\n2:12:08.540 --> 2:12:11.060\n So it's already, like that part is there,\n\n2:12:11.060 --> 2:12:15.980\n but it would be nice to have like, you know,\n\n2:12:15.980 --> 2:12:18.460\n nature level, like this is respect,\n\n2:12:18.460 --> 2:12:21.060\n this is a respectful accomplishment.\n\n2:12:21.060 --> 2:12:21.900\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:21.900 --> 2:12:23.780\n And something like a leaderboard,\n\n2:12:23.780 --> 2:12:25.980\n but a stable kind of system.\n\n2:12:25.980 --> 2:12:26.820\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:26.820 --> 2:12:27.660\n And I should mention too,\n\n2:12:27.660 --> 2:12:29.100\n so there's a crypto angle to this too,\n\n2:12:29.100 --> 2:12:31.540\n which is, so research hub has a coin associated\n\n2:12:31.540 --> 2:12:32.580\n with research coin.\n\n2:12:32.580 --> 2:12:34.400\n And it's basically, if people, you know,\n\n2:12:34.400 --> 2:12:37.100\n upvote your paper or like support it,\n\n2:12:37.100 --> 2:12:38.980\n you'll accumulate more research coin,\n\n2:12:38.980 --> 2:12:42.180\n which is basically like rep or like a reward token.\n\n2:12:42.180 --> 2:12:45.340\n And so that is a way to, I guess,\n\n2:12:45.340 --> 2:12:49.500\n measure the community's collective view of that paper,\n\n2:12:49.500 --> 2:12:51.180\n a form of peer review.\n\n2:12:51.180 --> 2:12:53.140\n And it can even be weighted by like the reputation\n\n2:12:53.140 --> 2:12:55.980\n of the people voting on it and that sort of thing over time.\n\n2:12:57.100 --> 2:12:59.500\n Yeah, I think the last thing I'll just say is that,\n\n2:12:59.500 --> 2:13:02.460\n so I think from a rep, like a prestige point of view,\n\n2:13:03.660 --> 2:13:05.100\n it won't start off that way.\n\n2:13:05.100 --> 2:13:07.440\n It'll probably start off like being a little more quirky,\n\n2:13:07.440 --> 2:13:10.100\n like, you know, like remember when YouTube first started,\n\n2:13:10.100 --> 2:13:13.260\n it was like people posting weird cat videos and stuff.\n\n2:13:13.260 --> 2:13:14.400\n And, but now like, you know,\n\n2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:16.020\n if you have a million subscribers on YouTube,\n\n2:13:16.020 --> 2:13:18.460\n that's probably better than getting like a TV show on NBC\n\n2:13:18.460 --> 2:13:21.000\n or whoever the traditional gatekeeper was.\n\n2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:23.460\n So my hope, it might take 10 years, 20 years, whatever,\n\n2:13:23.460 --> 2:13:27.140\n but I'm hoping that this can sort of be the new\n\n2:13:27.140 --> 2:13:30.060\n prestigious way that young people publish in science\n\n2:13:30.060 --> 2:13:32.460\n and it'll come to be viewed as more prestigious.\n\n2:13:32.460 --> 2:13:34.100\n The journals, the traditional journals\n\n2:13:34.100 --> 2:13:36.020\n will be viewed as old fashioned.\n\n2:13:36.020 --> 2:13:41.020\n Well, it's definitely a system that could do a lot better.\n\n2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:43.380\n And there's a lot of incredible, brilliant people\n\n2:13:43.380 --> 2:13:47.500\n doing science, they deserve better, the better platforms.\n\n2:13:47.500 --> 2:13:50.260\n So another thing you're taking on and helping out with\n\n2:13:50.260 --> 2:13:53.820\n is this new limit, which is looking at longevity.\n\n2:13:53.820 --> 2:13:55.660\n What's the idea there?\n\n2:13:55.660 --> 2:13:58.080\n Yeah, okay, so as you can see, I'm excited about science.\n\n2:13:58.080 --> 2:14:01.140\n Like I think, you know, science is sort of the,\n\n2:14:01.140 --> 2:14:03.300\n basically if you get scientific innovation,\n\n2:14:03.300 --> 2:14:06.340\n then you get better products and you get better\n\n2:14:06.340 --> 2:14:09.700\n economic growth and then you get all kinds of like surplus\n\n2:14:09.700 --> 2:14:12.500\n in society that can go to arts and philosophy\n\n2:14:12.500 --> 2:14:13.340\n and like all kinds of stuff.\n\n2:14:13.340 --> 2:14:17.660\n But with new limits, so yeah, I kind of got,\n\n2:14:17.660 --> 2:14:21.080\n I started hosting some dinners with scientists last year\n\n2:14:21.080 --> 2:14:23.620\n and I was learning about all kinds of the latest stuff\n\n2:14:23.620 --> 2:14:26.340\n happening in bio and there's a lot of really cool stuff\n\n2:14:26.340 --> 2:14:28.340\n happening with like CAR T cells and CRISPR\n\n2:14:28.340 --> 2:14:29.180\n and all these things.\n\n2:14:29.180 --> 2:14:32.740\n And anyway, one of the topics I started to learn more about\n\n2:14:32.740 --> 2:14:35.140\n was something called cell reprogramming.\n\n2:14:35.140 --> 2:14:38.700\n And, you know, people maybe have heard of this\n\n2:14:38.700 --> 2:14:40.700\n induced pluripotent stem cells where you could take\n\n2:14:40.700 --> 2:14:43.260\n like a skin cell and turn it back into a stem cell.\n\n2:14:43.260 --> 2:14:46.900\n And Shinya Yamanaka won the Nobel prize for this work\n\n2:14:46.900 --> 2:14:49.020\n that was done in 2006.\n\n2:14:49.020 --> 2:14:51.780\n And, you know, it's kind of a crazy thing.\n\n2:14:51.780 --> 2:14:54.300\n You can turn one cell into another type of cell.\n\n2:14:54.300 --> 2:14:58.020\n Well, people recently have been experimenting\n\n2:14:58.020 --> 2:15:01.280\n with different types of transcription factors\n\n2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:02.900\n that would either not,\n\n2:15:02.900 --> 2:15:04.140\n you don't want the cell to go all the way back\n\n2:15:04.140 --> 2:15:05.600\n to being a stem cell.\n\n2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:07.320\n You can end up getting like cancerous cells\n\n2:15:07.320 --> 2:15:08.160\n and things like that.\n\n2:15:08.160 --> 2:15:10.520\n But you want it basically the cell to revert\n\n2:15:10.520 --> 2:15:13.380\n a little bit earlier in its, you know,\n\n2:15:13.380 --> 2:15:15.020\n it would call it the Waddington landscape,\n\n2:15:15.020 --> 2:15:17.660\n but it's basically like go, become act,\n\n2:15:17.660 --> 2:15:19.700\n start to act like a bit of a younger cell,\n\n2:15:19.700 --> 2:15:23.020\n but not to de differentiate and become more like a stem cell.\n\n2:15:23.020 --> 2:15:25.760\n And so I decided this might be an interesting area\n\n2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:27.020\n to go fund.\n\n2:15:27.020 --> 2:15:28.780\n I think that that team has come together.\n\n2:15:28.780 --> 2:15:30.900\n There's like some really talented people\n\n2:15:30.900 --> 2:15:32.540\n who've come together to help get that off the ground.\n\n2:15:32.540 --> 2:15:36.080\n And they're basically building a platform\n\n2:15:36.080 --> 2:15:38.820\n that can test a lot of different transcription factors\n\n2:15:38.820 --> 2:15:41.420\n on different cell types and hopefully find ways\n\n2:15:41.420 --> 2:15:44.380\n to rejuvenate different types of cells and tissues\n\n2:15:44.380 --> 2:15:45.520\n to extend human health span.\n\n2:15:45.520 --> 2:15:47.760\n I mean, the moonshot goal here, you know,\n\n2:15:47.760 --> 2:15:51.700\n the get to Mars is that there could be some therapy here\n\n2:15:51.700 --> 2:15:54.260\n that in, I don't know, 10 or 20 years that you take\n\n2:15:54.260 --> 2:15:56.580\n and from a whole body point of view\n\n2:15:56.580 --> 2:15:58.340\n is sort of rejuvenating tissue,\n\n2:15:58.340 --> 2:16:00.740\n not just one type of tissue like your immune system,\n\n2:16:00.740 --> 2:16:02.560\n but eventually your whole body, maybe even your brain\n\n2:16:02.560 --> 2:16:04.900\n so that, you know, we don't have that issue\n\n2:16:04.900 --> 2:16:06.540\n where people who are older have trouble learning\n\n2:16:06.540 --> 2:16:08.740\n or they're more ossified in their thinking.\n\n2:16:10.100 --> 2:16:13.700\n To me, this is just, I always think about, you know,\n\n2:16:13.700 --> 2:16:15.540\n it's actually a little inspired by Elon, right?\n\n2:16:15.540 --> 2:16:18.060\n Is like, what are some of the biggest things in the world\n\n2:16:18.060 --> 2:16:20.520\n like that are probably high technology risk,\n\n2:16:20.520 --> 2:16:21.540\n but if they did work,\n\n2:16:21.540 --> 2:16:23.560\n maybe they're kind of low chance of working,\n\n2:16:23.560 --> 2:16:26.040\n but if they did work would have enormous impact.\n\n2:16:26.040 --> 2:16:28.380\n I like the idea of trying hard tech problems,\n\n2:16:28.380 --> 2:16:30.880\n especially for people like founders like me\n\n2:16:30.880 --> 2:16:32.460\n who've made some money in software,\n\n2:16:32.460 --> 2:16:34.700\n which I think we're in kind of like a golden age of software\n\n2:16:34.700 --> 2:16:36.540\n so there's like fortunes to be made,\n\n2:16:36.540 --> 2:16:38.680\n but if you do make some money in that,\n\n2:16:38.680 --> 2:16:42.700\n my hope is people will like do atoms, not bits, you know,\n\n2:16:42.700 --> 2:16:45.020\n and try some of the harder things like in biotech\n\n2:16:45.020 --> 2:16:48.460\n or, you know, I guess he's doing cars and rockets and stuff,\n\n2:16:48.460 --> 2:16:52.500\n but anyway, I think we should try hard tech\n\n2:16:52.500 --> 2:16:54.640\n or, you know, physical science problems as well\n\n2:16:54.640 --> 2:16:58.140\n and see if that can advance for team human.\n\n2:16:58.140 --> 2:17:02.740\n Yeah, so he's also doing bio with Neuralink\n\n2:17:02.740 --> 2:17:07.340\n and I feel like bio is tough because it's messy.\n\n2:17:07.340 --> 2:17:08.380\n We don't understand it as well.\n\n2:17:08.380 --> 2:17:09.460\n We don't understand it.\n\n2:17:09.460 --> 2:17:14.240\n The risk is higher in terms of, not the risk is higher,\n\n2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:18.260\n but like you have to deal with the actual sort of,\n\n2:17:18.260 --> 2:17:21.500\n to get to human, to get to stuff\n\n2:17:21.500 --> 2:17:24.680\n where it could be therapies for actual human bodies\n\n2:17:24.680 --> 2:17:29.620\n is tricky because you have to prove that it's safe,\n\n2:17:29.620 --> 2:17:33.560\n it's effective, all those kinds of things with FDA.\n\n2:17:33.560 --> 2:17:34.880\n I mean, it's just, it's tricky.\n\n2:17:34.880 --> 2:17:36.160\n It's very difficult.\n\n2:17:36.160 --> 2:17:38.520\n It's a long journey.\n\n2:17:38.520 --> 2:17:39.360\n I mean.\n\n2:17:39.360 --> 2:17:41.700\n If I can give a quick plug.\n\n2:17:41.700 --> 2:17:43.420\n So yeah, I'm on the board at New Limit.\n\n2:17:43.420 --> 2:17:45.160\n We're hiring talented scientists\n\n2:17:45.160 --> 2:17:47.040\n that are interested in the cellular programming space.\n\n2:17:47.040 --> 2:17:48.840\n They don't necessarily have to be coming\n\n2:17:48.840 --> 2:17:50.720\n from like an aging background or anything like that.\n\n2:17:50.720 --> 2:17:53.120\n There's sort of a small group of people doing even.\n\n2:17:53.120 --> 2:17:54.240\n So this is a new thing?\n\n2:17:54.240 --> 2:17:56.400\n This is a, is New Limit relatively new?\n\n2:17:56.400 --> 2:17:57.640\n Yeah, it's very new.\n\n2:17:57.640 --> 2:18:00.700\n There's a small team today, just a handful of people.\n\n2:18:00.700 --> 2:18:03.660\n And so we're hiring more there.\n\n2:18:03.660 --> 2:18:05.600\n If people are excited about that space, reach out.\n\n2:18:05.600 --> 2:18:07.920\n And same thing for Research Hub.\n\n2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:10.100\n There's a small team there that's really awesome.\n\n2:18:10.100 --> 2:18:12.400\n That's doing more like software engineering,\n\n2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:15.040\n design, product, that kind of stuff.\n\n2:18:15.040 --> 2:18:16.760\n What advice would you give?\n\n2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:21.240\n If you put on your old, wise, sage hat,\n\n2:18:21.240 --> 2:18:24.000\n what advice would you give to young people today?\n\n2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:29.000\n High school, maybe undergrad and college about life.\n\n2:18:29.560 --> 2:18:34.200\n So like career, having a career they can be proud of,\n\n2:18:34.200 --> 2:18:36.380\n or maybe a life they can be proud of.\n\n2:18:37.720 --> 2:18:40.440\n So people can do whatever they want to be happy, right?\n\n2:18:40.440 --> 2:18:42.360\n So there's not one way to do it.\n\n2:18:42.360 --> 2:18:44.840\n I do think that some people,\n\n2:18:44.840 --> 2:18:46.440\n a particular type of people out there,\n\n2:18:46.440 --> 2:18:47.280\n a lot of people actually,\n\n2:18:47.280 --> 2:18:48.480\n they want to have an impact on the world.\n\n2:18:48.480 --> 2:18:50.960\n That's how they get a sense of fulfillment, right?\n\n2:18:50.960 --> 2:18:53.680\n So I mean, you need to have like health, physical health.\n\n2:18:53.680 --> 2:18:55.040\n You need to have good relationships,\n\n2:18:55.040 --> 2:18:56.440\n like there's lots of things.\n\n2:18:56.440 --> 2:18:58.440\n But most people want to do something important.\n\n2:18:58.440 --> 2:18:59.720\n They want to have fulfilling work,\n\n2:18:59.720 --> 2:19:01.760\n a way that they can feel like they're contributing.\n\n2:19:02.800 --> 2:19:05.240\n I think a lot of people, young people today are thinking\n\n2:19:05.240 --> 2:19:09.560\n like I should be an activist or something like that.\n\n2:19:09.560 --> 2:19:11.480\n And there's people in the world who have power\n\n2:19:11.480 --> 2:19:13.840\n and a lot of people who don't, I don't have power.\n\n2:19:13.840 --> 2:19:18.120\n And so the way to change the world is to speak truth\n\n2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:20.440\n to power or like criticize power\n\n2:19:20.440 --> 2:19:24.200\n and try to pressure them to change.\n\n2:19:25.400 --> 2:19:27.040\n To me, I don't think that's the right way\n\n2:19:27.040 --> 2:19:28.880\n to actually have an impact on the world\n\n2:19:28.880 --> 2:19:33.720\n because everybody has probably,\n\n2:19:33.720 --> 2:19:36.840\n I think people have more power than they realize.\n\n2:19:36.840 --> 2:19:39.520\n And by the way, it's easy to be a critic.\n\n2:19:39.520 --> 2:19:42.200\n It's hard to actually change these things and fix it.\n\n2:19:42.200 --> 2:19:44.680\n And so you'll get a lot of accolades\n\n2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:46.080\n from friends and things like that\n\n2:19:46.080 --> 2:19:48.600\n if you kind of go around criticizing, it's easy to do.\n\n2:19:48.600 --> 2:19:51.520\n Like everything is broken and could be better,\n\n2:19:51.520 --> 2:19:53.360\n including stuff I'm working on.\n\n2:19:53.360 --> 2:19:56.040\n I find like so frustrating.\n\n2:19:56.040 --> 2:19:57.640\n There's a million things I want to be better about\n\n2:19:57.640 --> 2:19:59.280\n like what we're doing in Coinbase.\n\n2:20:01.200 --> 2:20:04.120\n So be the person in the arena,\n\n2:20:04.120 --> 2:20:05.520\n like that Theodore Roosevelt quote,\n\n2:20:05.520 --> 2:20:06.960\n I think he said it right.\n\n2:20:06.960 --> 2:20:10.160\n Like go chew glass and stare into the abyss.\n\n2:20:10.160 --> 2:20:11.840\n Like if you really want to have an impact,\n\n2:20:11.840 --> 2:20:14.560\n either join a company that has a mission\n\n2:20:14.560 --> 2:20:16.200\n that is trying to fix the thing you're passionate about\n\n2:20:16.200 --> 2:20:18.960\n or start that company if it doesn't exist\n\n2:20:18.960 --> 2:20:21.640\n or start a charity if it's not suitable\n\n2:20:21.640 --> 2:20:23.080\n to be a company or whatever it is,\n\n2:20:23.080 --> 2:20:25.680\n but go try to be a part of the solution.\n\n2:20:25.680 --> 2:20:30.320\n Don't just criticize or be a part of the problem.\n\n2:20:30.320 --> 2:20:34.160\n My hope is that more people can realize\n\n2:20:37.520 --> 2:20:39.880\n that they actually can have a meaningful impact that way.\n\n2:20:39.880 --> 2:20:41.720\n And I think that to me,\n\n2:20:41.720 --> 2:20:44.360\n technology is actually one of the most important ways\n\n2:20:44.360 --> 2:20:45.480\n to improve the world.\n\n2:20:45.480 --> 2:20:49.200\n Like if you look at climate change,\n\n2:20:49.200 --> 2:20:51.960\n like a lot of the best ideas like carbon sequestration,\n\n2:20:51.960 --> 2:20:53.640\n all these things, it's a technology thing, right?\n\n2:20:53.640 --> 2:20:55.960\n If you want to try to fix education,\n\n2:20:55.960 --> 2:20:57.400\n it's like look at like Khan Academy\n\n2:20:57.400 --> 2:20:59.080\n and all this stuff going online, right?\n\n2:20:59.080 --> 2:21:02.760\n If you want to fix, you know, whatever transportation\n\n2:21:02.760 --> 2:21:06.280\n and like the financial system and global freedom\n\n2:21:06.280 --> 2:21:07.840\n and like equality of all these things,\n\n2:21:07.840 --> 2:21:11.240\n like there's typically the way to get something changed\n\n2:21:11.240 --> 2:21:13.280\n in the world today is with technology.\n\n2:21:13.280 --> 2:21:15.880\n And so I do think people, it's very bizarre to me\n\n2:21:15.880 --> 2:21:19.200\n that there's this kind of like anti tech thing going on.\n\n2:21:19.200 --> 2:21:20.520\n Look, nothing is perfect.\n\n2:21:20.520 --> 2:21:21.640\n Like if you create something new\n\n2:21:21.640 --> 2:21:23.520\n and like tens of millions of people use it\n\n2:21:23.520 --> 2:21:24.400\n or billions of people use it,\n\n2:21:24.400 --> 2:21:26.440\n it's like there's going to be some bad people\n\n2:21:26.440 --> 2:21:27.360\n who use it too, okay?\n\n2:21:27.360 --> 2:21:29.520\n And there's, you know, society is complicated,\n\n2:21:29.520 --> 2:21:33.040\n but like I think most of these things have been net positive\n\n2:21:33.040 --> 2:21:34.640\n because most people in the world are good\n\n2:21:34.640 --> 2:21:36.200\n is at least my view.\n\n2:21:36.200 --> 2:21:39.120\n So yes, we can mitigate like the 1% of bad people\n\n2:21:39.120 --> 2:21:41.000\n trying to abuse something,\n\n2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:42.640\n but 99% of people in the world are good.\n\n2:21:42.640 --> 2:21:45.040\n And the way you can improve the world is with technology,\n\n2:21:45.040 --> 2:21:46.480\n joining companies, starting companies\n\n2:21:46.480 --> 2:21:48.260\n that are working on the right stuff.\n\n2:21:48.260 --> 2:21:50.920\n So I hope more young people do that.\n\n2:21:50.920 --> 2:21:53.560\n And just, if you're not sure what to do,\n\n2:21:53.560 --> 2:21:54.880\n like just get started with anything.\n\n2:21:54.880 --> 2:21:55.780\n That's how you learn.\n\n2:21:55.780 --> 2:21:57.800\n And basically have the optimism\n\n2:21:57.800 --> 2:22:00.240\n that you have the power to do the change.\n\n2:22:00.240 --> 2:22:05.140\n So it's easy to distract yourself by being the critic.\n\n2:22:06.240 --> 2:22:08.200\n That's almost like acknowledging to yourself\n\n2:22:08.200 --> 2:22:09.600\n that that's all you can be,\n\n2:22:09.600 --> 2:22:14.600\n but basically everybody has the power to be the fixer.\n\n2:22:16.160 --> 2:22:19.800\n I like, chew glass and look into the abyss.\n\n2:22:21.600 --> 2:22:23.980\n That's much more fun than it sounds.\n\n2:22:25.760 --> 2:22:27.400\n What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?\n\n2:22:27.400 --> 2:22:29.040\n Why are we here?\n\n2:22:29.040 --> 2:22:29.960\n Life.\n\n2:22:29.960 --> 2:22:31.760\n Yep, what's the meaning of life?\n\n2:22:31.760 --> 2:22:34.120\n What's this existence we got?\n\n2:22:34.120 --> 2:22:36.380\n You're trying to increase the amount of economic freedom\n\n2:22:36.380 --> 2:22:38.240\n on this planet or trying to alleviate\n\n2:22:38.240 --> 2:22:39.500\n some of the suffering.\n\n2:22:39.500 --> 2:22:40.340\n Yeah.\n\n2:22:40.340 --> 2:22:41.840\n But why?\n\n2:22:41.840 --> 2:22:44.400\n I don't really think there is any point to life.\n\n2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:49.200\n You know, somebody once told me,\n\n2:22:50.600 --> 2:22:51.680\n you know, if you go into these like,\n\n2:22:51.680 --> 2:22:54.600\n kind of really big existential questions,\n\n2:22:54.600 --> 2:22:55.680\n it can get a little scary\n\n2:22:55.680 --> 2:22:58.160\n because like you stare off the cliff\n\n2:22:58.160 --> 2:22:59.360\n and there's like, there's nothing there.\n\n2:22:59.360 --> 2:23:03.920\n You know, this one person told me one time they were like,\n\n2:23:03.920 --> 2:23:08.180\n you know, Brian, you should probably snorkel, don't scuba.\n\n2:23:08.180 --> 2:23:11.380\n I guess, and I think they were trying to say like,\n\n2:23:11.380 --> 2:23:13.080\n I, some of my friends have done this, right?\n\n2:23:13.080 --> 2:23:16.940\n They'll go to like, you know, epic meditation retreats\n\n2:23:16.940 --> 2:23:19.360\n and like, they'll kind of come back\n\n2:23:19.360 --> 2:23:21.580\n with all this existential dread of like,\n\n2:23:21.580 --> 2:23:22.420\n what's the meaning of it all.\n\n2:23:22.420 --> 2:23:24.120\n And then like, as far as I can tell,\n\n2:23:24.120 --> 2:23:27.740\n we are just some organic molecules in the ocean\n\n2:23:27.740 --> 2:23:30.000\n started like dividing and replicating\n\n2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:32.500\n and the selfish gene and all this stuff,\n\n2:23:32.500 --> 2:23:34.600\n like basically ended up here.\n\n2:23:34.600 --> 2:23:38.080\n And our only, it's some kind of like really naive algorithm\n\n2:23:38.080 --> 2:23:39.760\n that's just kind of trying to get us\n\n2:23:39.760 --> 2:23:40.960\n to survive and replicate.\n\n2:23:40.960 --> 2:23:43.600\n And we have DNA just like every other animal.\n\n2:23:43.600 --> 2:23:45.240\n And so we happened to develop\n\n2:23:45.240 --> 2:23:46.920\n these like really cool neocortexes.\n\n2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:48.600\n And so now we're sort of self aware\n\n2:23:48.600 --> 2:23:51.000\n and we have all these big questions\n\n2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:54.080\n and maybe we'll create another, you know,\n\n2:23:54.080 --> 2:23:55.000\n as computers get better,\n\n2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:57.080\n we'll create the simulation inside our thing.\n\n2:23:57.080 --> 2:23:58.780\n And I think it's cool.\n\n2:23:58.780 --> 2:23:59.800\n Like we should basically,\n\n2:23:59.800 --> 2:24:02.680\n I just want to keep watching the movie, you know, unfold.\n\n2:24:02.680 --> 2:24:04.640\n That's part of why I want to work on,\n\n2:24:04.640 --> 2:24:05.920\n like New Limit is really cool.\n\n2:24:05.920 --> 2:24:07.720\n Cause it's helped, if people can live longer,\n\n2:24:07.720 --> 2:24:10.680\n whether that's uploading their brain to the cloud\n\n2:24:10.680 --> 2:24:14.300\n or, you know, basically through we get biology to work\n\n2:24:14.300 --> 2:24:17.140\n or the strong AI to work or whatever.\n\n2:24:17.140 --> 2:24:18.760\n One of those two hopefully works out.\n\n2:24:18.760 --> 2:24:20.680\n And then we get to keep watching the movie\n\n2:24:20.680 --> 2:24:22.160\n and see how it all unfolds.\n\n2:24:22.160 --> 2:24:23.360\n I think that's fun.\n\n2:24:23.360 --> 2:24:25.640\n And so I don't know if that's like an answer,\n\n2:24:25.640 --> 2:24:27.640\n but I guess I don't think there's any real purpose.\n\n2:24:27.640 --> 2:24:28.640\n So just try to have fun.\n\n2:24:28.640 --> 2:24:32.760\n Well, the cool thing is that we get to write the movie\n\n2:24:32.760 --> 2:24:34.480\n as we watch it.\n\n2:24:34.480 --> 2:24:36.640\n Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n2:24:36.640 --> 2:24:38.680\n I mean, that's like the Steve Jobs quote and all that,\n\n2:24:38.680 --> 2:24:40.400\n where he's like, everything around you was invented\n\n2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:42.400\n by somebody who just was like,\n\n2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:43.560\n this was a crazy idea they thought up.\n\n2:24:43.560 --> 2:24:48.560\n So once you realize you can kind of do anything you want,\n\n2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:53.040\n then that's what you start to go,\n\n2:24:53.040 --> 2:24:55.120\n you start to go try crazier stuff.\n\n2:24:55.120 --> 2:24:57.720\n I mean, this is another one of those areas where,\n\n2:24:57.720 --> 2:24:58.560\n not to get too out there,\n\n2:24:58.560 --> 2:25:00.280\n but like, you know, when you're,\n\n2:25:00.280 --> 2:25:02.060\n I think you can build your comfort zone\n\n2:25:02.060 --> 2:25:03.980\n around like people being upset with you.\n\n2:25:03.980 --> 2:25:06.940\n You can also build your range\n\n2:25:06.940 --> 2:25:08.180\n of what you think is possible, right?\n\n2:25:08.180 --> 2:25:10.480\n Like when I was in my 20s,\n\n2:25:10.480 --> 2:25:12.160\n I was like reading all these books\n\n2:25:12.160 --> 2:25:13.880\n about like self improvement and goal,\n\n2:25:13.880 --> 2:25:15.080\n how to write down your goals and stuff.\n\n2:25:15.080 --> 2:25:17.960\n And my goals were like,\n\n2:25:17.960 --> 2:25:21.920\n someday I wanna make $100,000 a year or something like,\n\n2:25:21.920 --> 2:25:24.560\n and that was, and you know,\n\n2:25:25.420 --> 2:25:28.080\n and it seemed like a little outlandish or what,\n\n2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:28.980\n I wrote down these goals,\n\n2:25:28.980 --> 2:25:31.680\n like I wanna own rental property or something anyway.\n\n2:25:31.680 --> 2:25:35.120\n And then I slowly started to get some of these things done\n\n2:25:35.120 --> 2:25:35.960\n over a couple of years.\n\n2:25:35.960 --> 2:25:38.460\n And so I started to think a little bigger.\n\n2:25:38.460 --> 2:25:41.060\n I remember one time I wrote down this goal where I was like,\n\n2:25:41.060 --> 2:25:42.920\n what's the craziest thing I could think of?\n\n2:25:42.920 --> 2:25:44.680\n And I was like, what if I, I wanna write,\n\n2:25:44.680 --> 2:25:47.320\n I wanna start a billion dollar tech company.\n\n2:25:47.320 --> 2:25:48.240\n That's crazy.\n\n2:25:48.240 --> 2:25:50.960\n And I had never started like a million dollar tech company\n\n2:25:50.960 --> 2:25:52.200\n or any tech company really.\n\n2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:54.960\n So what business did I have writing that goal down?\n\n2:25:54.960 --> 2:25:58.440\n I remember I wrote that on a piece of paper like,\n\n2:25:58.440 --> 2:26:00.980\n like probably every day for a year or something almost,\n\n2:26:00.980 --> 2:26:01.820\n right?\n\n2:26:01.820 --> 2:26:02.640\n I don't know if it was every day,\n\n2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:03.680\n but like I wrote it down a lot.\n\n2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:06.680\n And so little things started to happen.\n\n2:26:06.680 --> 2:26:07.560\n I was like, all right,\n\n2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:09.280\n well, maybe I should move back to the Bay area\n\n2:26:09.280 --> 2:26:10.120\n from Buenos Aires.\n\n2:26:10.120 --> 2:26:13.080\n Maybe I should try to apply to Y Combinator or whatever.\n\n2:26:13.080 --> 2:26:15.280\n Like, and I started thinking about these ideas.\n\n2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:16.960\n And so whatever it gets you fired up,\n\n2:26:16.960 --> 2:26:18.760\n it doesn't have to be like some company goal\n\n2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:19.600\n or startup thing.\n\n2:26:19.600 --> 2:26:21.620\n It could be anything, right?\n\n2:26:21.620 --> 2:26:22.600\n Maybe you wanna publish a book\n\n2:26:22.600 --> 2:26:25.120\n or like do something creatively or whatever.\n\n2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:30.120\n Anyway, I think like within seven years, no,\n\n2:26:32.160 --> 2:26:33.280\n it's probably more like 10 years\n\n2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:34.780\n of me writing that goal down.\n\n2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:38.800\n Coinbase had a valuation over a billion dollars.\n\n2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:42.880\n So it was out of my realm of what was even possible.\n\n2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:44.640\n And then within 10 years,\n\n2:26:44.640 --> 2:26:46.680\n you can accomplish more in 10 years than you think,\n\n2:26:46.680 --> 2:26:48.480\n less in a year than you think.\n\n2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:51.680\n So now I'm like, okay, what's the next goal?\n\n2:26:51.680 --> 2:26:55.640\n What's the, okay, maybe I wanna get a billion people\n\n2:26:55.640 --> 2:26:57.580\n accessing the open financial system\n\n2:26:57.580 --> 2:27:00.040\n through our products every day.\n\n2:27:00.040 --> 2:27:01.680\n That would be cool for humanity.\n\n2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:03.480\n And that's a pretty crazy goal.\n\n2:27:03.480 --> 2:27:05.080\n Like there's only 8 billion people or something, right?\n\n2:27:05.080 --> 2:27:06.520\n So there's one out of eight.\n\n2:27:07.940 --> 2:27:09.760\n Or maybe I can radically,\n\n2:27:09.760 --> 2:27:12.780\n like if I make some like the right investments or whatever,\n\n2:27:12.780 --> 2:27:16.580\n I can like help radically extend human health span\n\n2:27:16.580 --> 2:27:17.480\n or whatever, right?\n\n2:27:18.840 --> 2:27:21.240\n So try crazier stuff.\n\n2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:22.520\n I don't know, even if it doesn't work,\n\n2:27:22.520 --> 2:27:27.520\n like hopefully you'll advance the state of affairs,\n\n2:27:27.560 --> 2:27:29.120\n like something interesting will happen.\n\n2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:31.160\n And so most people today,\n\n2:27:31.160 --> 2:27:33.500\n they look at people trying this stuff and they're like,\n\n2:27:33.500 --> 2:27:35.800\n oh my God, they're so, they're a genius or whatever.\n\n2:27:35.800 --> 2:27:37.040\n And it's like, or they're an idiot.\n\n2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:39.600\n Like one of the two, neither one are true.\n\n2:27:39.600 --> 2:27:42.020\n It's just like anybody can start\n\n2:27:42.020 --> 2:27:45.200\n by thinking about what they want and then like go for it.\n\n2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:46.400\n And then once you get that,\n\n2:27:46.400 --> 2:27:47.480\n like go for something a little bigger\n\n2:27:47.480 --> 2:27:48.920\n and like you just have fun with it.\n\n2:27:48.920 --> 2:27:53.560\n And the universe is a way of smiling and helping you out\n\n2:27:53.560 --> 2:27:57.440\n if you just write it down and you dream big.\n\n2:27:57.440 --> 2:27:59.800\n There's something about just karma,\n\n2:27:59.800 --> 2:28:03.000\n about the energy you put into this world.\n\n2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:05.240\n Other people will help you out, doors will open.\n\n2:28:05.240 --> 2:28:07.460\n You'll notice that the doors opened\n\n2:28:07.460 --> 2:28:10.600\n and you actually have a shot at making it happen.\n\n2:28:10.600 --> 2:28:12.240\n It's a funny world.\n\n2:28:12.240 --> 2:28:14.360\n Yeah, I mean, I don't really subscribe\n\n2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:16.040\n to all like the woo woo interpretations of this,\n\n2:28:16.040 --> 2:28:18.360\n but my very rational brain interpretation of it\n\n2:28:18.360 --> 2:28:20.200\n is that if you just wake up every day\n\n2:28:20.200 --> 2:28:22.160\n and write down like what you want to get done\n\n2:28:22.160 --> 2:28:24.400\n and towards your longer goals, your larger goals,\n\n2:28:24.400 --> 2:28:26.580\n it's just on your mind that day.\n\n2:28:26.580 --> 2:28:28.040\n So you start to notice opportunities\n\n2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:29.380\n and you think about it more.\n\n2:28:29.380 --> 2:28:32.080\n So Brian, thank you for dreaming big.\n\n2:28:32.080 --> 2:28:33.440\n Thank you for doing what you're doing,\n\n2:28:33.440 --> 2:28:35.660\n doing incredible engineering at scale,\n\n2:28:37.140 --> 2:28:39.600\n trying to help people from all over the world\n\n2:28:39.600 --> 2:28:43.360\n and actually helping me personally get more into crypto\n\n2:28:43.360 --> 2:28:46.400\n just cause it's so easy.\n\n2:28:46.400 --> 2:28:48.080\n So thank you so much.\n\n2:28:48.080 --> 2:28:49.600\n And thank you so much\n\n2:28:49.600 --> 2:28:51.920\n for giving your extremely valuable time today\n\n2:28:51.920 --> 2:28:53.320\n to this awesome conversation.\n\n2:28:53.320 --> 2:28:55.080\n Thanks for your awesome podcast.\n\n2:28:55.080 --> 2:28:57.560\n I love it and I listen to it often.\n\n2:28:57.560 --> 2:28:59.000\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:00.520\n with Brian Armstrong.\n\n2:29:00.520 --> 2:29:01.720\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:29:01.720 --> 2:29:04.320\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:29:04.320 --> 2:29:06.200\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n2:29:06.200 --> 2:29:08.300\n from Benjamin Franklin.\n\n2:29:08.300 --> 2:29:13.000\n An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.\n\n2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:18.000\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
