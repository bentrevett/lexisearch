University,\n\n00:06.280 --> 00:09.920\n national coach of the USA International Math Olympia team,\n\n00:09.920 --> 00:13.480\n and founder of XP that does online education\n\n00:13.480 --> 00:15.240\n of basic math and science.\n\n00:15.240 --> 00:17.040\n He's also the founder of Novid,\n\n00:17.040 --> 00:19.560\n an app that takes a really interesting approach\n\n00:19.560 --> 00:20.760\n to contact tracing,\n\n00:20.760 --> 00:23.080\n making sure you stay completely anonymous\n\n00:23.080 --> 00:25.840\n and it gives you statistical information about COVID cases\n\n00:25.840 --> 00:28.880\n in your physical network of interactions.\n\n00:28.880 --> 00:31.600\n So you can maintain privacy, very important,\n\n00:31.600 --> 00:34.160\n and make informed decisions.\n\n00:34.160 --> 00:35.000\n In my opinion,\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:38.720\n we desperately needed solutions like this in early 2020.\n\n00:38.720 --> 00:41.440\n And unfortunately, I think,\n\n00:41.440 --> 00:44.680\n we will again need it for the next pandemic.\n\n00:44.680 --> 00:46.920\n To me, solutions that require large scale,\n\n00:46.920 --> 00:49.640\n distributed coordination of human beings\n\n00:49.640 --> 00:53.400\n need ideas that emphasize freedom and knowledge.\n\n00:53.400 --> 00:55.120\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:55.120 --> 00:58.720\n Jordan Harbinger Show, Onnit, BetterHelp,\n\n00:58.720 --> 01:01.200\n Aidsleep, and Element.\n\n01:01.200 --> 01:04.320\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n01:04.320 --> 01:07.160\n As a side note, let me say that Po and I\n\n01:07.160 --> 01:08.400\n filmed a few short videos\n\n01:08.400 --> 01:10.640\n about simple, beautiful math concepts\n\n01:10.640 --> 01:12.960\n that I will release soon.\n\n01:12.960 --> 01:14.080\n It was really fun.\n\n01:14.080 --> 01:16.640\n I really enjoyed Po sharing his passion for math with me\n\n01:16.640 --> 01:17.840\n in those videos.\n\n01:17.840 --> 01:19.960\n I'm hoping to do a few more short videos\n\n01:19.960 --> 01:23.160\n in the coming months that are educational in nature\n\n01:23.160 --> 01:26.520\n on AI, robotics, math, science, philosophy,\n\n01:26.520 --> 01:28.840\n or if all else fails,\n\n01:28.840 --> 01:32.920\n just fun snippets into my life on music, books, martial arts,\n\n01:32.920 --> 01:34.720\n and other random things,\n\n01:34.720 --> 01:38.240\n if that's of interest to anyone at all.\n\n01:38.240 --> 01:40.200\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,\n\n01:40.200 --> 01:42.960\n and here's my conversation with Po Shenlow.\n\n01:43.840 --> 01:46.520\n You know, you mentioned you really enjoy flying\n\n01:46.520 --> 01:49.720\n and experiencing different people in different places.\n\n01:49.720 --> 01:51.160\n There's something about flying for me,\n\n01:51.160 --> 01:53.080\n I don't know if you have the same experience,\n\n01:53.080 --> 01:55.680\n that every time I get on an airplane,\n\n01:55.680 --> 01:58.040\n it's incredible to me that human beings\n\n01:58.040 --> 02:00.240\n have actually been able to achieve this.\n\n02:00.240 --> 02:03.720\n And when I look at like what's happening now\n\n02:03.720 --> 02:06.400\n with humans traveling out into space,\n\n02:06.400 --> 02:08.080\n I see it as all the same thing.\n\n02:08.080 --> 02:11.240\n It's incredible that humans are able to get into a box\n\n02:11.240 --> 02:16.240\n and fly in the air and safely and land\n\n02:16.320 --> 02:18.040\n in the same, it seems like,\n\n02:18.040 --> 02:19.920\n and everybody's taking it for granted.\n\n02:19.920 --> 02:22.480\n So when I observe them, it's quite fascinating\n\n02:22.480 --> 02:25.880\n because I see that cleanly mapping to the world\n\n02:25.880 --> 02:30.880\n where we're now in rockets and traveling to the moon,\n\n02:31.520 --> 02:34.360\n traveling to Mars, and at the same kind of way,\n\n02:34.360 --> 02:36.480\n I can already see the future\n\n02:36.480 --> 02:38.680\n where we will all take it for granted.\n\n02:40.040 --> 02:42.680\n So I don't know if you have,\n\n02:42.680 --> 02:44.320\n you personally, when you fly,\n\n02:44.320 --> 02:46.440\n have the same kind of magical experience\n\n02:46.440 --> 02:49.080\n of like how the heck did humans actually accomplish this?\n\n02:49.080 --> 02:52.560\n So I do, especially when there's turbulence,\n\n02:52.560 --> 02:56.080\n which is like on the way here, there was turbulence\n\n02:56.080 --> 02:58.880\n and the plane jiggled, even the flight attendant\n\n02:58.880 --> 03:00.200\n had to hold onto the side.\n\n03:00.200 --> 03:01.360\n And I was just thinking to myself,\n\n03:01.360 --> 03:03.200\n it's amazing that this happens all the time\n\n03:03.200 --> 03:04.960\n and the wings don't fall off,\n\n03:04.960 --> 03:06.600\n given how many planes are flying.\n\n03:06.600 --> 03:09.160\n But then I often think about it and I'm like,\n\n03:09.160 --> 03:12.160\n a long time ago, I think people didn't trust elevators\n\n03:12.160 --> 03:14.400\n in a 40 story building in New York City.\n\n03:14.400 --> 03:17.000\n And now we just take it completely for granted\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:18.600\n that you can step into this shaft,\n\n03:18.600 --> 03:23.200\n which is 40 floors up and down, and it will just not fail.\n\n03:24.440 --> 03:26.760\n Yeah, again, I'm the same way with elevators,\n\n03:26.760 --> 03:30.360\n but also buildings, when I'll stand on the 40th floor\n\n03:30.360 --> 03:35.320\n and wonder how the heck are we not falling right now?\n\n03:35.320 --> 03:39.120\n Like how amazing it is with the high winds,\n\n03:39.120 --> 03:42.200\n like structurally, just the earthquakes and the vibrations,\n\n03:42.200 --> 03:44.520\n I mean, natural vibrations in the ground.\n\n03:44.520 --> 03:46.960\n Like how is this, how are all of these,\n\n03:46.960 --> 03:49.920\n you go to like New York City, all of these buildings standing.\n\n03:49.920 --> 03:52.120\n I mean, to me, one of the most beautiful things,\n\n03:52.120 --> 03:54.760\n actually mathematically too, is bridges.\n\n03:54.760 --> 03:57.560\n I used to build bridges in high school from like toothpicks,\n\n03:57.560 --> 04:02.320\n just like out of the pure joy of like physics,\n\n04:02.320 --> 04:05.800\n making some structure really strong.\n\n04:05.800 --> 04:09.600\n Understanding like from a civil engineering perspective,\n\n04:09.600 --> 04:12.040\n what kind of structure will be stronger\n\n04:12.040 --> 04:14.720\n than another kind of structure, like suspension bridges.\n\n04:14.720 --> 04:17.160\n And then you see that at scale,\n\n04:17.160 --> 04:20.400\n humans being able to span a body of water\n\n04:20.400 --> 04:22.240\n with a giant bridge.\n\n04:22.240 --> 04:26.480\n And it's, I don't know, it's so humbling.\n\n04:26.480 --> 04:31.480\n It makes you realize how dependent we are on each other.\n\n04:31.920 --> 04:33.360\n Sort of, I talk about love a lot,\n\n04:33.360 --> 04:37.960\n but there's a certain element in which we little ants\n\n04:37.960 --> 04:39.640\n have just a small amount of knowledge\n\n04:39.640 --> 04:41.880\n about our particular thing.\n\n04:41.880 --> 04:45.360\n And then we're depending on a network of knowledge\n\n04:45.360 --> 04:47.360\n that other experts hold.\n\n04:47.360 --> 04:49.200\n And then most of our lives,\n\n04:49.200 --> 04:51.120\n most of the quality of life we have\n\n04:51.120 --> 04:56.120\n has to do with the richness of that network of knowledge,\n\n04:56.600 --> 04:58.280\n of that collaboration,\n\n04:58.280 --> 05:02.000\n and then sort of the ability to build on top of it,\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:03.200\n levels of abstractions.\n\n05:03.200 --> 05:05.760\n You start from like bits in a computer,\n\n05:05.760 --> 05:08.800\n then you can have assembly, then you can have C++,\n\n05:08.800 --> 05:09.920\n or you have an operating system,\n\n05:09.920 --> 05:12.040\n then you can have C++ and Python, finally,\n\n05:12.040 --> 05:13.440\n some machine learning on top.\n\n05:13.440 --> 05:14.960\n All of these are abstractions.\n\n05:14.960 --> 05:17.120\n And eventually we'll have AI that runs all of us humans.\n\n05:17.120 --> 05:21.280\n But anyway, but speaking of abstractions and programming,\n\n05:21.280 --> 05:24.720\n in high school, you wrote some impressive games\n\n05:24.720 --> 05:26.080\n for MS DOS.\n\n05:26.080 --> 05:28.080\n I got a chance to, in browser somehow,\n\n05:28.080 --> 05:30.480\n it's magic, I got a chance to play them.\n\n05:31.720 --> 05:34.560\n Alien Attack 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n05:34.560 --> 05:37.240\n What's the hardest part about programming those games?\n\n05:37.240 --> 05:41.080\n And maybe can you tell the story about building those games?\n\n05:41.080 --> 05:41.920\n Sure.\n\n05:41.920 --> 05:44.240\n I actually tried to do those in high school\n\n05:44.240 --> 05:46.480\n because I was just curious if I could.\n\n05:46.480 --> 05:49.280\n That's a good starting point for anything, right?\n\n05:49.280 --> 05:50.480\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like, could you?\n\n05:50.480 --> 05:52.000\n But the appealing thing was also,\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.160\n it was a soup to nuts kind of thing.\n\n05:54.160 --> 05:56.560\n So something that has always attracted me is,\n\n05:56.560 --> 05:59.920\n I like beautiful ideas, I like seeing beautiful ideas,\n\n05:59.920 --> 06:03.760\n but I actually also like seeing execution of an idea\n\n06:03.760 --> 06:06.360\n all the way from beginning to end in something that works.\n\n06:06.360 --> 06:08.000\n So for example, in high school,\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.880\n I was lucky enough to grow up in the late 90s\n\n06:10.880 --> 06:13.720\n when even a high school student could hope\n\n06:13.720 --> 06:16.200\n to make something sort of comparable\n\n06:16.200 --> 06:18.640\n to the shareware games that were out there.\n\n06:18.640 --> 06:21.240\n I say the word sort of, like still quite far away,\n\n06:21.240 --> 06:25.000\n but at least I didn't need to hire a 3D CG artist.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.200\n There weren't enough pixels to draw anyway,\n\n06:27.200 --> 06:28.400\n even I can draw, right?\n\n06:29.360 --> 06:30.280\n Bad art, of course.\n\n06:30.280 --> 06:31.640\n But the point is, I wanted to know,\n\n06:31.640 --> 06:34.640\n is it possible for me to try to do those things\n\n06:34.640 --> 06:36.600\n where back in those days,\n\n06:36.600 --> 06:38.440\n you didn't even have an easy way\n\n06:38.440 --> 06:41.200\n to draw letters on the screen in a particular font.\n\n06:41.200 --> 06:44.080\n You couldn't just say import a font, it wasn't like Python.\n\n06:44.080 --> 06:45.440\n So for example, back then,\n\n06:45.440 --> 06:47.560\n if you played those games in the web browser,\n\n06:47.560 --> 06:51.840\n which is emulating the old school computer,\n\n06:51.840 --> 06:53.520\n those, even the letters you see,\n\n06:53.520 --> 06:55.120\n those are made by individual calls\n\n06:55.120 --> 06:56.800\n to draw pixels on the screen.\n\n06:56.800 --> 06:58.240\n So you built that from scratch,\n\n06:58.240 --> 07:01.000\n almost building a computer graphics library from scratch?\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.120\n Yes, the primitive that I got to use\n\n07:03.120 --> 07:05.600\n was some code I copied off of a book in assembly\n\n07:05.600 --> 07:08.720\n of how to put a pixel on a screen in a particular color.\n\n07:08.720 --> 07:11.760\n And the programming language was Pascal?\n\n07:11.760 --> 07:14.400\n Ah, yeah, the first one was in Pascal,\n\n07:14.400 --> 07:18.120\n but then the other ones were in C++ after that.\n\n07:18.120 --> 07:20.640\n How's the emulation in the browser work, by the way?\n\n07:20.640 --> 07:21.640\n Is that trivial?\n\n07:21.640 --> 07:23.520\n Because it's pretty cool, you get to play these games\n\n07:23.520 --> 07:26.480\n that have a very much 90s feeling to them.\n\n07:26.480 --> 07:29.320\n Ah, so it's literally making an MSDOS environment,\n\n07:29.320 --> 07:32.240\n which is literally running the old.exe file.\n\n07:32.240 --> 07:33.520\n Wow, in the browser.\n\n07:33.520 --> 07:37.800\n This is, that could be more amazing than the airplane.\n\n07:37.800 --> 07:40.240\n So it wasn't so much about the video games,\n\n07:40.240 --> 07:41.400\n it was more about,\n\n07:41.400 --> 07:44.120\n can you build something really cool from scratch?\n\n07:44.120 --> 07:45.440\n Yes.\n\n07:45.440 --> 07:50.280\n And you did a bunch of programming competitions.\n\n07:50.280 --> 07:54.680\n What was your interest, your love for programming?\n\n07:54.680 --> 07:56.880\n What did you learn through that experience?\n\n07:56.880 --> 07:59.720\n Especially now that as much of your work\n\n07:59.720 --> 08:03.160\n has taken a long journey through mathematics.\n\n08:03.160 --> 08:04.920\n I think I always was amazed\n\n08:04.920 --> 08:08.440\n by how computers could do things fast.\n\n08:08.440 --> 08:11.560\n If I wanted to make it an abstract analysis\n\n08:11.560 --> 08:14.640\n of why it is that I saw some power in the computer.\n\n08:14.640 --> 08:16.360\n Because if the computer can do things\n\n08:16.360 --> 08:18.280\n so many times faster than humans,\n\n08:18.280 --> 08:20.280\n where the hard part is telling the computer\n\n08:20.280 --> 08:21.840\n what to do and how to do it,\n\n08:21.840 --> 08:25.600\n if you can master that asking the computer what to do,\n\n08:25.600 --> 08:28.200\n then you could conceivably achieve more things.\n\n08:28.200 --> 08:29.640\n And those contests I was in,\n\n08:29.640 --> 08:31.840\n those were the opposite in some sense\n\n08:31.840 --> 08:35.840\n of making a complete product, like a game is a product.\n\n08:35.840 --> 08:38.520\n Those contests were effectively write a function\n\n08:38.520 --> 08:40.760\n to do something extremely efficiently.\n\n08:40.760 --> 08:42.440\n And if you are able to do that,\n\n08:42.440 --> 08:45.800\n then you can unlock more of the power of the computer.\n\n08:45.800 --> 08:47.440\n But also doing it quickly.\n\n08:47.440 --> 08:49.640\n There's a time element from the human perspective\n\n08:49.640 --> 08:53.360\n to be able to program quickly.\n\n08:53.360 --> 08:54.840\n There's something nice.\n\n08:54.840 --> 08:57.920\n So there's almost like an athletics component\n\n08:57.920 --> 09:01.240\n to where you're almost like an athlete\n\n09:01.240 --> 09:03.920\n seeking optimal performance as a human being\n\n09:03.920 --> 09:05.680\n trying to write these programs.\n\n09:05.680 --> 09:07.440\n And at the same time, it's kind of art\n\n09:07.440 --> 09:11.080\n because the best way to write a program quickly\n\n09:11.080 --> 09:13.440\n is to write a simple program.\n\n09:13.440 --> 09:14.840\n You just have a damn good solution.\n\n09:14.840 --> 09:17.040\n So it's not necessarily you have to type fast.\n\n09:17.040 --> 09:19.520\n You have to think through a really clean,\n\n09:19.520 --> 09:22.760\n beautiful solution.\n\n09:22.760 --> 09:26.080\n I mean, what do you think is the use\n\n09:26.080 --> 09:27.760\n of those programming competitions?\n\n09:27.760 --> 09:29.160\n Do you think they're ultimately something\n\n09:29.160 --> 09:30.600\n you would recommend for students,\n\n09:30.600 --> 09:32.040\n for people interested in programming,\n\n09:32.040 --> 09:34.000\n or people interested in building stuff?\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:37.080\n Yes, I think so because especially with the work\n\n09:37.080 --> 09:38.120\n that I've been doing nowadays,\n\n09:38.120 --> 09:40.200\n even trying to control COVID,\n\n09:40.200 --> 09:42.560\n something that was very helpful from day one\n\n09:42.560 --> 09:45.560\n was understanding that the kinds of computations\n\n09:45.560 --> 09:47.080\n we would want to do,\n\n09:47.080 --> 09:50.440\n we could conceivably do on like a four core cloud machine\n\n09:50.440 --> 09:53.760\n on Amazon Web Services out to a population\n\n09:53.760 --> 09:55.280\n which might have hundreds of thousands\n\n09:55.280 --> 09:56.480\n or millions of people.\n\n09:56.480 --> 09:57.840\n The reason why that was important\n\n09:57.840 --> 10:00.760\n to have that back of the envelope calculation\n\n10:00.760 --> 10:02.720\n with efficient algorithms\n\n10:02.720 --> 10:04.960\n is because if we couldn't do that,\n\n10:04.960 --> 10:06.280\n then we would bankrupt ourselves\n\n10:06.280 --> 10:08.160\n before we could get to a big enough scale.\n\n10:08.160 --> 10:11.480\n If you think about how you grow anything from small to big,\n\n10:11.480 --> 10:13.600\n if in order to grow it from small to big,\n\n10:13.600 --> 10:16.480\n you also already need 10,000 cloud servers,\n\n10:16.480 --> 10:17.680\n you'll never get to big.\n\n10:19.400 --> 10:22.320\n And also the nice thing about programming competitions\n\n10:22.320 --> 10:26.440\n is that you actually build a thing that works.\n\n10:26.440 --> 10:29.040\n So you finish it, there's a completion thing,\n\n10:29.040 --> 10:32.520\n and you realize, I think there's a magic to it,\n\n10:32.520 --> 10:35.520\n where you realize that it's not so hard\n\n10:35.520 --> 10:37.520\n to build something that works.\n\n10:37.520 --> 10:40.560\n To have a system that successfully takes in inputs\n\n10:40.560 --> 10:43.360\n and produces outputs and solves a difficult problem,\n\n10:43.360 --> 10:47.040\n and that directly transfers to building a startup essentially\n\n10:47.040 --> 10:50.000\n that can help some aspect of this world\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.840\n as long as it's mostly based on software engineering.\n\n10:53.840 --> 10:54.960\n Things get really tricky\n\n10:54.960 --> 10:56.760\n when you have to manufacture stuff.\n\n10:58.480 --> 11:00.720\n That's why people like Elon Musk are so impressive\n\n11:00.720 --> 11:02.840\n that it's not just software.\n\n11:02.840 --> 11:05.640\n Tesla Autopilot is not just software.\n\n11:05.640 --> 11:07.640\n It's like you have to actually have factories\n\n11:07.640 --> 11:11.640\n that build cars, and there's like a million components\n\n11:11.640 --> 11:14.280\n involved in the machinery required\n\n11:14.280 --> 11:16.200\n to assemble those cars and so on.\n\n11:16.200 --> 11:19.000\n But in software, one person can change the world,\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.440\n which is incredible.\n\n11:21.440 --> 11:23.240\n But on the mathematics side,\n\n11:23.240 --> 11:26.760\n what, if you look back, or maybe today,\n\n11:26.760 --> 11:29.680\n what made you fall in love with mathematics?\n\n11:29.680 --> 11:33.320\n For me, I think I've always been very attracted\n\n11:33.320 --> 11:35.720\n to challenge, as I already indicated\n\n11:35.720 --> 11:37.320\n with writing the program.\n\n11:37.320 --> 11:40.440\n I guess if I see something that's hard\n\n11:40.440 --> 11:41.960\n or supposed to be impossible,\n\n11:44.200 --> 11:47.120\n sometimes I say, maybe I want to see if I can pull that off.\n\n11:47.120 --> 11:49.920\n And with the mathematics, the math competitions\n\n11:49.920 --> 11:53.560\n presented problems that were hard,\n\n11:53.560 --> 11:55.040\n that I didn't know how to start,\n\n11:55.040 --> 11:57.640\n but for which I could conceivably try to learn\n\n11:57.640 --> 11:59.120\n how to solve them.\n\n11:59.120 --> 12:00.480\n So, I mean, there are other things that are hard\n\n12:00.480 --> 12:03.360\n called like get something to Mars, get people to Mars.\n\n12:03.360 --> 12:05.800\n And I didn't, and I still don't think\n\n12:05.800 --> 12:08.160\n that I am able to solve that problem.\n\n12:08.160 --> 12:10.000\n On the other hand, the math problems struck me\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:11.440\n as things which are hard\n\n12:11.440 --> 12:13.560\n and with significant amount of extra work,\n\n12:13.560 --> 12:14.640\n I could figure it out.\n\n12:14.640 --> 12:16.560\n And maybe they would actually even be useful,\n\n12:16.560 --> 12:18.920\n like that mathematical skill is the core\n\n12:18.920 --> 12:20.240\n of lots of other things.\n\n12:22.680 --> 12:23.720\n That's really interesting.\n\n12:23.720 --> 12:25.120\n Maybe you could speak to that\n\n12:25.120 --> 12:28.440\n because a lot of people say that math is hard\n\n12:29.440 --> 12:31.600\n as a kind of negative statement.\n\n12:32.880 --> 12:35.120\n It always seemed to me a little bit like\n\n12:35.120 --> 12:37.360\n that's kind of a positive statement\n\n12:37.360 --> 12:40.360\n that all things that are worth having in this world,\n\n12:40.360 --> 12:41.440\n they're hard.\n\n12:41.440 --> 12:44.480\n I mean, everything that people think about\n\n12:44.480 --> 12:47.800\n that they would love to do, whether it's sports,\n\n12:47.800 --> 12:52.800\n whether it's art, music, and all the sciences,\n\n12:52.920 --> 12:54.000\n they're going to be hard\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.520\n if you want to do something special.\n\n12:56.520 --> 12:59.000\n So is there something you could say to that idea\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.160\n that math is hard?\n\n13:00.160 --> 13:04.200\n Should it be made easy or should it be hard?\n\n13:04.200 --> 13:07.120\n Ah, so I think maybe I want to dig in a little bit\n\n13:07.120 --> 13:09.360\n onto this hard part and say,\n\n13:09.360 --> 13:12.120\n I think the interesting thing about the math\n\n13:12.120 --> 13:14.800\n is that you can see a question\n\n13:14.800 --> 13:18.240\n that you didn't know how to start doing it before.\n\n13:18.240 --> 13:20.920\n And over a course of thinking about it,\n\n13:20.920 --> 13:24.400\n you can come up with a way to solve it.\n\n13:24.400 --> 13:25.960\n And so you can move from a state\n\n13:25.960 --> 13:28.160\n of not being able to do something\n\n13:28.160 --> 13:30.280\n to a state of being able to do something\n\n13:30.280 --> 13:33.280\n where you help to take yourself through that\n\n13:33.280 --> 13:37.600\n instead of somebody else spoon feeding you that technique.\n\n13:37.600 --> 13:39.480\n So actually here, I'm already digging into\n\n13:39.480 --> 13:42.080\n maybe part of my teaching philosophy also,\n\n13:42.080 --> 13:45.400\n which is that I actually don't want to ever\n\n13:45.400 --> 13:48.840\n just tell somebody, here's how you do something.\n\n13:48.840 --> 13:52.160\n I actually prefer to say, here's an interesting question.\n\n13:52.160 --> 13:54.240\n I know you don't quite know how to do it.\n\n13:54.240 --> 13:55.920\n Do you have any ideas?\n\n13:55.920 --> 13:58.920\n I'm actually explaining another way\n\n13:58.920 --> 14:00.400\n that you could try to do teaching.\n\n14:00.400 --> 14:04.160\n And I'm contrasting this to a method of watch me do this,\n\n14:04.160 --> 14:06.320\n now practice it 20 times.\n\n14:06.320 --> 14:09.080\n I'm trying to say a lot of people consider math to be hard\n\n14:09.080 --> 14:10.800\n because maybe they can't remember\n\n14:10.800 --> 14:12.800\n all of the methods that were taught.\n\n14:12.800 --> 14:15.560\n But for me, I look at the hardness\n\n14:15.560 --> 14:17.600\n and I don't think of it as a memory hardness.\n\n14:17.600 --> 14:21.920\n I think of it as a, can you invent something hardness?\n\n14:21.920 --> 14:24.360\n And I think that if we can teach more people\n\n14:24.360 --> 14:28.640\n how to do that art of invention in a pure cognitive way,\n\n14:28.640 --> 14:31.240\n not as hard as the actual hardware stuff, right?\n\n14:31.240 --> 14:32.640\n But like in terms of the concepts\n\n14:32.640 --> 14:34.000\n and the thoughts and the mathematics,\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.360\n teaching people how to invent,\n\n14:36.360 --> 14:38.840\n then suddenly actually they might not even find math\n\n14:38.840 --> 14:42.680\n to be that tiresomeness hard anymore,\n\n14:42.680 --> 14:47.480\n but that rewardingness hard of I have the capability\n\n14:47.480 --> 14:49.920\n of looking at something which I don't know what to do\n\n14:49.920 --> 14:51.400\n and coming up with how to do it.\n\n14:51.400 --> 14:52.840\n I actually think we should be doing that,\n\n14:52.840 --> 14:55.040\n giving people that capability.\n\n14:55.040 --> 14:58.160\n So hard in the same way that invention is hard,\n\n14:58.160 --> 14:59.520\n that is ultimately rewarding.\n\n14:59.520 --> 15:03.640\n So maybe you can dig in that a little bit longer,\n\n15:03.640 --> 15:08.640\n which is do you see basically the way to teach math\n\n15:11.200 --> 15:14.840\n is to present a problem and to give a person a chance\n\n15:14.840 --> 15:16.920\n to try to invent a solution\n\n15:18.480 --> 15:21.080\n with minimal amount of information first?\n\n15:21.080 --> 15:22.840\n Is that basically,\n\n15:22.840 --> 15:26.400\n how do you build that muscle of invention in a student?\n\n15:26.400 --> 15:27.840\n Yes, so the way that,\n\n15:27.840 --> 15:30.120\n I guess I have two different sort of ways\n\n15:30.120 --> 15:30.960\n that I try to teach.\n\n15:30.960 --> 15:32.960\n Actually, one of them is, in fact, this semester,\n\n15:32.960 --> 15:35.520\n because all my classes were remotely delivered,\n\n15:35.520 --> 15:37.200\n I even threw them all onto my YouTube channel.\n\n15:37.200 --> 15:39.960\n So you can see how I teach at Carnegie Mellon,\n\n15:39.960 --> 15:43.280\n but I'd often say, hey, everyone, let's try to do this.\n\n15:43.280 --> 15:44.680\n Any ideas?\n\n15:44.680 --> 15:47.760\n And that actually changes my role as a professor\n\n15:47.760 --> 15:50.040\n from a person who shows up for class\n\n15:50.040 --> 15:52.480\n with a script of what I wanna talk through.\n\n15:52.480 --> 15:54.000\n I actually, I don't have a script.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:55.680\n The way I show up for classes,\n\n15:55.680 --> 15:58.080\n there's something that we want to learn how to do,\n\n15:58.080 --> 16:00.120\n and we're gonna do it by improv.\n\n16:00.120 --> 16:02.760\n I'm talking about the same method as improv comedy,\n\n16:02.760 --> 16:05.240\n which is where you tell me some ideas,\n\n16:05.240 --> 16:07.040\n and I'll try to yes and them.\n\n16:07.040 --> 16:09.320\n You know what I mean?\n\n16:09.320 --> 16:10.400\n And then together,\n\n16:10.400 --> 16:13.000\n we're gonna come up with a proof of this concept\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:16.360\n where you were deeply involved in creating the proof.\n\n16:16.360 --> 16:18.040\n Actually, every time I teach the class,\n\n16:18.040 --> 16:19.800\n we do every proof slightly differently\n\n16:19.800 --> 16:23.400\n because it's based on how the students came up with it.\n\n16:23.400 --> 16:25.760\n And that's how I do it when I'm in person.\n\n16:25.760 --> 16:27.880\n I also have another line of courses that we make\n\n16:27.880 --> 16:29.200\n that is delivered online.\n\n16:29.200 --> 16:31.640\n Those things are where I can't do it live,\n\n16:31.640 --> 16:34.560\n but the teaching method became also similar.\n\n16:34.560 --> 16:37.160\n It was just, here's an interesting question.\n\n16:37.160 --> 16:38.240\n I know it's out of reach.\n\n16:38.240 --> 16:39.400\n Why don't you think about it?\n\n16:39.400 --> 16:40.640\n And then automatic hints.\n\n16:40.640 --> 16:44.120\n We feed automatically hints through the internet\n\n16:44.120 --> 16:46.720\n to go and let the person try to invent.\n\n16:47.560 --> 16:52.240\n So that's like a more rigorous prodding of invention.\n\n16:52.240 --> 16:56.000\n But you did mention disease and COVID,\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.160\n and you've been doing some very interesting stuff\n\n16:58.160 --> 17:01.920\n from a mathematical, but also software engineering angle\n\n17:01.920 --> 17:04.520\n of coming up with ideas.\n\n17:04.520 --> 17:07.440\n It's back to the, I see a problem.\n\n17:07.440 --> 17:08.680\n I think I can help.\n\n17:09.640 --> 17:11.120\n So you stepped into this world.\n\n17:11.120 --> 17:13.880\n Can you tell me about your work there\n\n17:13.880 --> 17:16.120\n under the flag of Novid\n\n17:16.120 --> 17:20.560\n and both the software and the technical details\n\n17:20.560 --> 17:21.680\n of how the thing works?\n\n17:21.680 --> 17:22.520\n Sure, sure.\n\n17:22.520 --> 17:24.520\n So first I want to make sure that I say,\n\n17:24.520 --> 17:26.000\n this is actually team effort.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:27.480\n I happen to be the one speaking,\n\n17:27.480 --> 17:29.040\n but there's no way this would exist\n\n17:29.040 --> 17:30.560\n without an incredible team of people\n\n17:30.560 --> 17:33.120\n who inspire me every day to work on this.\n\n17:33.120 --> 17:34.600\n But I'll speak on behalf of them.\n\n17:34.600 --> 17:39.600\n So the idea was indeed that we stepped forward\n\n17:40.200 --> 17:43.320\n in March of last year, when the world started to become,\n\n17:43.320 --> 17:44.800\n our part of the world started to become,\n\n17:44.800 --> 17:46.360\n our part meaning the United States\n\n17:46.360 --> 17:48.920\n started to become paralyzed by COVID.\n\n17:48.920 --> 17:50.760\n The shutdown started to happen.\n\n17:50.760 --> 17:54.240\n And at that time it started as a figment of an idea,\n\n17:54.240 --> 17:57.160\n which was network theory,\n\n17:57.160 --> 17:59.480\n which is the area of math that I work in,\n\n17:59.480 --> 18:02.440\n could potentially be combined with smartphones\n\n18:02.440 --> 18:06.040\n and some kind of health information anonymized.\n\n18:06.040 --> 18:07.080\n Exactly how?\n\n18:07.080 --> 18:07.960\n We didn't know yet.\n\n18:07.960 --> 18:09.400\n We tried to crystallize it.\n\n18:09.400 --> 18:11.400\n And many months into this work,\n\n18:11.400 --> 18:15.200\n we ended up accidentally discovering a new way\n\n18:15.200 --> 18:17.000\n to control diseases,\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.840\n which is now what is the main impetus of all of this work\n\n18:20.840 --> 18:23.440\n is to take this idea and polish it\n\n18:23.440 --> 18:25.960\n and hopefully have it be useful not only now,\n\n18:25.960 --> 18:27.400\n but for future pandemics.\n\n18:27.400 --> 18:29.680\n The idea is really simple to describe.\n\n18:29.680 --> 18:31.080\n Actually, my main thing in the world\n\n18:31.080 --> 18:33.720\n is I come up with obvious observations.\n\n18:33.720 --> 18:35.080\n That's that, so I'll explain it now.\n\n18:35.080 --> 18:36.880\n Einstein did the same thing\n\n18:36.880 --> 18:38.480\n and he wrote a few short papers.\n\n18:39.920 --> 18:41.800\n But so the idea is like this.\n\n18:41.800 --> 18:46.440\n If we describe how usually people control disease\n\n18:46.440 --> 18:47.920\n for a lot of history,\n\n18:47.920 --> 18:51.000\n it was that you'd find out who was sick,\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.280\n you'd find out who they've been around\n\n18:53.280 --> 18:56.120\n and you try to remove all of those people from society\n\n18:56.120 --> 18:57.840\n against their will.\n\n18:57.840 --> 18:58.960\n Now that's the problem.\n\n18:58.960 --> 19:00.880\n The against their will part\n\n19:00.880 --> 19:03.560\n gives you the wrong kind of a feedback loop,\n\n19:03.560 --> 19:05.520\n which makes it hard to control the disease\n\n19:05.520 --> 19:07.000\n because then the people you're trying to control\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:08.760\n keep getting other people sick.\n\n19:08.760 --> 19:10.120\n You can see already how I'm thinking\n\n19:10.120 --> 19:11.920\n and talking about this feedback loops.\n\n19:11.920 --> 19:14.240\n This is actually related to something you said earlier\n\n19:14.240 --> 19:17.120\n about even like how skyscrapers stay in the air.\n\n19:17.120 --> 19:19.360\n The whole point is control theory.\n\n19:19.360 --> 19:22.600\n You actually want to, or even how an airplane stays,\n\n19:22.600 --> 19:24.880\n you need to have control loops\n\n19:24.880 --> 19:27.040\n which are feedbacking in the right way.\n\n19:27.040 --> 19:29.880\n And what we observed was that the feedback control loop\n\n19:29.880 --> 19:32.160\n for controlling disease by asking people\n\n19:32.160 --> 19:34.480\n to be removed from society against their will\n\n19:34.480 --> 19:35.600\n was not working.\n\n19:35.600 --> 19:37.640\n It was running against human incentives\n\n19:37.640 --> 19:39.160\n and you suddenly are trying to control\n\n19:39.160 --> 19:41.440\n seven billion, eight billion people\n\n19:41.440 --> 19:43.600\n in ways that they don't individually want\n\n19:43.600 --> 19:45.160\n to necessarily do.\n\n19:45.160 --> 19:46.160\n So here's the idea.\n\n19:47.080 --> 19:48.320\n And this is inspired by the fact\n\n19:48.320 --> 19:49.480\n that at the core of our team\n\n19:49.480 --> 19:51.280\n were user experience designers.\n\n19:51.280 --> 19:53.480\n That's actually, in fact, the first thing I knew\n\n19:53.480 --> 19:54.560\n we needed when we started\n\n19:54.560 --> 19:57.160\n was to bring user experience at the core.\n\n19:57.160 --> 19:58.160\n Okay.\n\n19:58.160 --> 20:03.160\n But so the idea was suppose hypothetically\n\n20:03.600 --> 20:05.320\n there was a pandemic.\n\n20:05.320 --> 20:07.080\n What would you want?\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.320\n You would want a way to be able to live your life\n\n20:10.320 --> 20:13.680\n as much as possible and avoid getting sick.\n\n20:13.680 --> 20:17.400\n Can we make an app to help you avoid getting sick?\n\n20:17.400 --> 20:19.680\n Notice how I've just articulated the problem.\n\n20:19.680 --> 20:21.840\n It is not, can we make an app\n\n20:21.840 --> 20:24.720\n so that after you are around somebody who's sick\n\n20:24.720 --> 20:27.080\n you can be removed from society.\n\n20:27.080 --> 20:30.520\n It's can we make an app so that you can avoid getting sick.\n\n20:30.520 --> 20:32.480\n That would run a positive feed.\n\n20:33.520 --> 20:35.320\n I don't know if I want to call it positive or negative\n\n20:35.320 --> 20:36.840\n but it would run a good feedback loop.\n\n20:36.840 --> 20:37.680\n Okay.\n\n20:37.680 --> 20:38.840\n So then how would you do this?\n\n20:38.840 --> 20:41.480\n The only problem is that you don't know who's sick\n\n20:41.480 --> 20:44.120\n because especially with this disease\n\n20:44.120 --> 20:46.960\n if I see somebody who looks perfectly healthy\n\n20:46.960 --> 20:50.000\n the disease spreads two days before you have any symptoms.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.360\n And so it's actually not possible.\n\n20:52.360 --> 20:54.760\n That's where the network theory comes in.\n\n20:54.760 --> 20:56.560\n You caught it from someone.\n\n20:56.560 --> 20:59.560\n What if we changed the paradigm\n\n20:59.560 --> 21:02.440\n and we said, whenever there's a sickness\n\n21:02.440 --> 21:06.200\n tell everybody how many physical relationships\n\n21:06.200 --> 21:08.000\n separate them from the sickness.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.840\n That is the trivial idea we added.\n\n21:09.840 --> 21:13.360\n The trivial idea was the distance between you and a disease\n\n21:13.360 --> 21:16.600\n is not measured in feet or seconds.\n\n21:16.600 --> 21:19.040\n It's measured in terms of how many\n\n21:19.040 --> 21:22.040\n close physical relationships separate you\n\n21:22.040 --> 21:25.400\n like these six degrees of separation like LinkedIn.\n\n21:25.400 --> 21:26.480\n Simple idea.\n\n21:26.480 --> 21:28.080\n What if we told everyone that?\n\n21:28.080 --> 21:30.200\n It turns out that actually unlocks\n\n21:30.200 --> 21:33.040\n some interesting behavioral feedback loops\n\n21:33.040 --> 21:37.040\n which for example, let me now jump to a non COVID example\n\n21:37.040 --> 21:39.240\n to show why this maybe could be useful.\n\n21:39.240 --> 21:40.920\n Actually we think it could be quite useful.\n\n21:40.920 --> 21:44.080\n Imagine there was Ebola or some hemorrhagic fever.\n\n21:44.080 --> 21:46.400\n Imagine it spread through contact through the air.\n\n21:46.400 --> 21:48.160\n In fact, pretend, pretend.\n\n21:50.520 --> 21:52.800\n That's a disastrous disease.\n\n21:52.800 --> 21:54.720\n It has high fatality rate.\n\n21:54.720 --> 21:59.160\n And as you die, you're bleeding out of every orifice.\n\n22:00.640 --> 22:01.480\n Okay.\n\n22:01.480 --> 22:02.320\n So.\n\n22:02.320 --> 22:03.160\n Yeah, not pleasant.\n\n22:03.160 --> 22:04.000\n Not pleasant.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.560\n So the question is, suppose that such a disease broke\n\n22:07.680 --> 22:10.440\n who would want to install an app that would tell them\n\n22:10.440 --> 22:12.640\n how many relationships away from them\n\n22:12.640 --> 22:14.240\n this disease had struck?\n\n22:14.240 --> 22:15.600\n Like a lot of people.\n\n22:15.600 --> 22:16.440\n A lot of people.\n\n22:16.440 --> 22:20.160\n In fact, almost, I don't want to say almost everyone.\n\n22:20.160 --> 22:21.000\n That's a very strong statement\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:22.840\n but a very large number of people.\n\n22:22.840 --> 22:24.200\n That's fascinating framing.\n\n22:24.200 --> 22:28.040\n Like the more deadly and transmissible the disease\n\n22:28.040 --> 22:32.080\n the stronger the incentive to install it in a positive sense\n\n22:32.080 --> 22:36.000\n the, in the good feedback loop sense.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:37.200\n That's a really good example.\n\n22:37.200 --> 22:38.520\n It's a really good way to frame it.\n\n22:38.520 --> 22:42.240\n Cause with COVID, it was not as deadly\n\n22:42.240 --> 22:45.440\n as potential pandemics could have been\n\n22:45.440 --> 22:46.280\n viruses could have been.\n\n22:46.280 --> 22:49.160\n So it's sometimes muddled with how we think about it\n\n22:49.160 --> 22:51.040\n but yeah, this is a really good framing.\n\n22:51.040 --> 22:53.720\n If the virus was a lot more deadly\n\n22:53.720 --> 22:56.280\n you want to create a system that has a set of incentives\n\n22:56.280 --> 22:59.400\n that it quickly spreads to the population\n\n22:59.400 --> 23:00.960\n where everybody is using it\n\n23:00.960 --> 23:04.200\n and it's contributing in a positive way to the system.\n\n23:04.200 --> 23:05.040\n Exactly.\n\n23:05.040 --> 23:06.080\n And actually that point you just made\n\n23:06.080 --> 23:07.760\n I don't take credit for that observation.\n\n23:07.760 --> 23:09.000\n There was another person I talked to\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.360\n who pointed out that it's very interesting\n\n23:11.360 --> 23:14.600\n that this feedback loop is even more effective\n\n23:14.600 --> 23:16.960\n when the disease is worse.\n\n23:16.960 --> 23:19.720\n And that's actually not a bad characteristic to have\n\n23:19.720 --> 23:20.640\n in your feedback loop\n\n23:20.640 --> 23:24.320\n if you're trying to help civilization keep running.\n\n23:24.320 --> 23:27.320\n Yeah, it's a really, it's in this dynamic\n\n23:27.320 --> 23:30.440\n like people figure out, they dynamically figure out\n\n23:30.440 --> 23:31.920\n how bad the disease is.\n\n23:31.920 --> 23:35.080\n The more it spreads and the deadlier it is\n\n23:35.080 --> 23:37.200\n as the people observe it\n\n23:37.200 --> 23:39.640\n as long as the spread of information\n\n23:39.640 --> 23:43.440\n like semantic information, natural language information\n\n23:43.440 --> 23:46.040\n is closely aligned with the reality of the disease\n\n23:46.040 --> 23:48.120\n which is a whole nother conversation, right?\n\n23:48.120 --> 23:51.000\n We, that's, we might, maybe we'll chat about that\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.800\n how we sort of make sure there's not misinformation\n\n23:53.800 --> 23:54.960\n while there's accurate information\n\n23:54.960 --> 23:58.840\n but that aside, okay, so this is a really nice property.\n\n23:58.840 --> 24:00.880\n Right, and just going on on that\n\n24:00.880 --> 24:02.840\n actually just talking more about what that could do\n\n24:02.840 --> 24:04.440\n and why we're so excited about it.\n\n24:04.440 --> 24:07.320\n It's that not only would people want to install it\n\n24:07.320 --> 24:10.800\n but what would they do if you start to see\n\n24:10.800 --> 24:13.200\n that this disease is getting closer and closer?\n\n24:13.200 --> 24:15.080\n We surveyed informally people\n\n24:15.080 --> 24:18.600\n but they said, as we saw it getting closer, we would hide.\n\n24:18.600 --> 24:21.800\n We would try to not have contacts.\n\n24:21.800 --> 24:24.080\n But now you notice what this has just achieved.\n\n24:24.080 --> 24:27.400\n The whole goal on this whole exercise was\n\n24:27.400 --> 24:29.720\n you got the people who might be sick\n\n24:29.720 --> 24:32.000\n and you got everyone else, set A and set B.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.360\n Set A is the people who might be sick,\n\n24:33.360 --> 24:34.840\n set B is everyone else.\n\n24:34.840 --> 24:37.680\n And for the entirety of the past\n\n24:37.680 --> 24:41.680\n contact tracing approaches, you tried to get set A\n\n24:41.680 --> 24:44.920\n to do things that might not be to their liking or their will\n\n24:44.920 --> 24:47.680\n because that's removing them from society.\n\n24:47.680 --> 24:49.040\n We found out that there's two ways\n\n24:49.040 --> 24:51.120\n to separate set A from set B.\n\n24:51.120 --> 24:53.400\n You can also let the people at set B\n\n24:53.400 --> 24:55.720\n at the fringe of set A\n\n24:55.720 --> 24:58.920\n attempt to remove themselves from this interface.\n\n24:58.920 --> 25:01.560\n It's the symmetry of A and B separation.\n\n25:01.560 --> 25:04.520\n Everyone was looking at A, we look at B\n\n25:04.520 --> 25:06.960\n and suddenly B is in their incentive to do so.\n\n25:07.960 --> 25:08.960\n Beautiful.\n\n25:08.960 --> 25:11.960\n So there's a virus that jumps from human to human.\n\n25:11.960 --> 25:15.200\n So there's a network sometimes called graph\n\n25:16.240 --> 25:18.400\n of the spread of a virus.\n\n25:18.400 --> 25:21.640\n It hops from person to person to person to person.\n\n25:21.640 --> 25:25.760\n And each one of us individuals are sitting\n\n25:25.760 --> 25:28.200\n or plopped into that network.\n\n25:28.200 --> 25:31.680\n We have close friends and relations and so on.\n\n25:31.680 --> 25:32.520\n It's kind of fascinating\n\n25:32.520 --> 25:33.880\n to actually think about this network\n\n25:33.880 --> 25:35.520\n and we can maybe talk about the shapes\n\n25:35.520 --> 25:36.720\n of this kind of network.\n\n25:37.680 --> 25:39.920\n Because I was trying to think exactly this,\n\n25:39.920 --> 25:41.400\n like how many people do I,\n\n25:41.400 --> 25:43.480\n well, I'm kind of an introvert, not kind of,\n\n25:43.480 --> 25:45.160\n I'm very much an introvert.\n\n25:45.160 --> 25:48.200\n But so can I be explicit about the kind of people\n\n25:48.200 --> 25:50.360\n I meet in regular life?\n\n25:50.360 --> 25:53.280\n Say when it was completely opened up, there's no pandemic.\n\n25:54.840 --> 25:58.480\n There is a kind of network and there's maybe\n\n25:59.440 --> 26:02.280\n in the graph theoretic sense, there's some weights\n\n26:02.280 --> 26:06.920\n or something about how close that relationship is\n\n26:06.920 --> 26:08.800\n in terms of the frequency of visits,\n\n26:08.800 --> 26:11.560\n the duration of visits and all of those kinds of things.\n\n26:11.560 --> 26:14.840\n So you're saying we might want to be,\n\n26:14.840 --> 26:18.040\n to create on top of that network,\n\n26:18.040 --> 26:22.240\n a spread of information to let you know\n\n26:22.240 --> 26:24.400\n as the virus travels through this network,\n\n26:24.400 --> 26:26.240\n how close is it getting to you?\n\n26:26.240 --> 26:29.240\n And the number of hops away it is on that network\n\n26:29.240 --> 26:31.320\n is really powerful information\n\n26:31.320 --> 26:33.960\n that creates a positive feedback loop\n\n26:33.960 --> 26:37.400\n where you can act essentially anonymously\n\n26:39.080 --> 26:41.200\n and on your own.\n\n26:41.200 --> 26:43.960\n Like nobody's telling you what to do,\n\n26:43.960 --> 26:46.920\n which is really important, is decentralized\n\n26:46.920 --> 26:51.920\n and not whatever the opposite of authoritarian is.\n\n26:52.200 --> 26:54.640\n But you get to sort of the American way.\n\n26:54.640 --> 26:56.320\n You get to choose to do it yourself.\n\n26:56.320 --> 26:58.440\n You have the freedom to do it yourself\n\n26:58.440 --> 27:00.160\n and you're incentivized to do it.\n\n27:00.160 --> 27:01.920\n And you're most likely going to do it\n\n27:01.920 --> 27:06.920\n to protect yourself against you getting the disease\n\n27:08.400 --> 27:10.000\n as the closer it gets to you\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\n based on the information that you have.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:15.880\n But can you maybe elaborate, first of all, brilliant.\n\n27:17.880 --> 27:20.320\n Whenever I saw the thing you're working on,\n\n27:20.320 --> 27:23.360\n so forget for COVID, this is of course,\n\n27:23.360 --> 27:26.800\n really relevant for COVID, but it's also probably relevant\n\n27:26.800 --> 27:28.160\n for future diseases as well.\n\n27:28.160 --> 27:30.400\n So that was the thing I'm nervous about.\n\n27:30.400 --> 27:31.840\n I was like, if this whole,\n\n27:31.840 --> 27:34.720\n if our society shut down because of COVID,\n\n27:34.720 --> 27:38.040\n like what the heck is gonna happen\n\n27:38.040 --> 27:40.480\n when there's a much deadlier disease?\n\n27:40.480 --> 27:41.920\n Like this, this is disappointing.\n\n27:41.920 --> 27:44.760\n The whole time, 2020, the whole time\n\n27:44.760 --> 27:45.960\n I'm just sitting like this,\n\n27:45.960 --> 27:49.840\n like is the incompetence of everybody\n\n27:49.840 --> 27:53.000\n except the people developing vaccines.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:54.400\n The biologists are the only ones\n\n27:54.400 --> 27:56.040\n that got their stuff together.\n\n27:56.040 --> 27:58.560\n But in terms of institutions and all that kind of stuff,\n\n27:58.560 --> 28:00.720\n it's just been terrible.\n\n28:00.720 --> 28:04.080\n But this is exactly the power of information\n\n28:04.080 --> 28:05.960\n and the power of information\n\n28:05.960 --> 28:08.080\n that doesn't limit personal freedom.\n\n28:08.080 --> 28:09.400\n So your idea is brilliant.\n\n28:09.400 --> 28:12.680\n Okay, mathematically, can you maybe elaborate\n\n28:12.680 --> 28:14.080\n what are we talking about?\n\n28:14.080 --> 28:16.480\n Like how do you actually make that work?\n\n28:16.480 --> 28:17.680\n What's involved?\n\n28:17.680 --> 28:19.720\n Sure, first I'm gonna reply to something you said\n\n28:19.720 --> 28:22.400\n about the freedom inside this,\n\n28:22.400 --> 28:24.480\n because actually that was the idea.\n\n28:24.480 --> 28:27.320\n The idea is this is game theory, right?\n\n28:27.320 --> 28:29.600\n And effectively what we did is analogous\n\n28:29.600 --> 28:34.600\n to free market economy, as opposed to central planning.\n\n28:34.840 --> 28:38.120\n If you just line up the set of incentives correctly\n\n28:38.120 --> 28:43.120\n so that people have in their purely selfish behavior\n\n28:43.240 --> 28:47.120\n are contributing to the optimization of the global function,\n\n28:47.120 --> 28:47.960\n that's it.\n\n28:47.960 --> 28:50.400\n And the point of what we do, I guess in mathematics\n\n28:50.400 --> 28:52.800\n is we try to explore the search space\n\n28:52.800 --> 28:54.960\n to go and find out as many possibilities as there are.\n\n28:54.960 --> 28:58.080\n And in this case, it's an applied search space.\n\n28:58.080 --> 29:00.120\n That's why the inputs from design,\n\n29:00.120 --> 29:02.720\n user experience design and actual people are important.\n\n29:02.720 --> 29:05.760\n But you asked about, I guess, the mathematical\n\n29:05.760 --> 29:07.640\n or the technical things underpinning it.\n\n29:07.640 --> 29:09.800\n So I think the first thing I'll say is\n\n29:09.800 --> 29:11.480\n we wanted to make this thing\n\n29:12.600 --> 29:14.760\n not require your personal information.\n\n29:14.760 --> 29:16.360\n And so in order to do that,\n\n29:16.360 --> 29:18.800\n what gave me the confidence to, I guess,\n\n29:18.800 --> 29:20.560\n lead our team to run at the beginning\n\n29:20.560 --> 29:23.800\n is we saw that this could be done without using GPS information.\n\n29:24.960 --> 29:28.160\n So technically what's going on is if two smartphones,\n\n29:28.160 --> 29:29.040\n it's a smartphone app.\n\n29:29.040 --> 29:31.480\n If two smartphones have this thing installed,\n\n29:31.480 --> 29:34.560\n they just communicate with each other by Bluetooth\n\n29:35.440 --> 29:37.080\n to go and find out how far,\n\n29:38.200 --> 29:40.080\n they can detect nearby things by Bluetooth.\n\n29:40.080 --> 29:42.040\n And then they can find out that these two phones\n\n29:42.040 --> 29:44.880\n were approximately such and such distance apart.\n\n29:44.880 --> 29:47.680\n And that kind of relative proximity information\n\n29:47.680 --> 29:50.640\n is enough to construct this big network.\n\n29:50.640 --> 29:53.160\n Okay, so the physical network is constructed\n\n29:53.160 --> 29:56.040\n based on proximity that's through Bluetooth\n\n29:56.040 --> 29:59.320\n and you don't have to specify your exact location,\n\n29:59.320 --> 30:01.200\n it's the proximity.\n\n30:01.200 --> 30:03.320\n I'm not using the Pythagorean theorem basically.\n\n30:03.320 --> 30:05.520\n I mean, if I just knew the GPS coordinates,\n\n30:05.520 --> 30:07.320\n we could use the Pythagorean theorem too.\n\n30:07.320 --> 30:08.520\n Sorry, that's just how I call it.\n\n30:08.520 --> 30:10.520\n Distance formula, whatever you want to call it.\n\n30:10.520 --> 30:14.800\n Yeah, so we're not doing\n\n30:14.800 --> 30:18.280\n the old Pythagorean based violation of privacy.\n\n30:18.280 --> 30:19.120\n Okay.\n\n30:21.240 --> 30:26.200\n But so is that enough to form,\n\n30:27.280 --> 30:31.160\n to give you enough information about physical connection\n\n30:31.160 --> 30:32.880\n to another human being?\n\n30:32.880 --> 30:35.240\n Is there a time element there?\n\n30:35.240 --> 30:37.400\n Is there, so, okay.\n\n30:37.400 --> 30:41.560\n That sounds like a really strong, like low hanging fruit.\n\n30:41.560 --> 30:42.480\n Like if you have that,\n\n30:42.480 --> 30:44.920\n you could probably go really, really far.\n\n30:44.920 --> 30:46.880\n My natural question is,\n\n30:46.880 --> 30:49.760\n is there extra information you can add on top of that?\n\n30:49.760 --> 30:53.520\n Like the duration of the physical proximity?\n\n30:53.520 --> 30:56.640\n So first of all, we actually do estimate the duration,\n\n30:56.640 --> 30:58.360\n but the way we estimate the duration\n\n30:58.360 --> 31:00.440\n is like how a movie is filmed,\n\n31:00.440 --> 31:03.200\n in the sense that every so often, every few minutes,\n\n31:03.200 --> 31:04.640\n we check what's nearby.\n\n31:04.640 --> 31:06.240\n It's like how a movie is filmed.\n\n31:06.240 --> 31:07.960\n You take lots of snapshots.\n\n31:07.960 --> 31:11.280\n So there's no way in a battery efficient way\n\n31:11.280 --> 31:14.680\n to really keep track of that proximity.\n\n31:14.680 --> 31:17.120\n However, fortunately, we're using probability.\n\n31:17.120 --> 31:20.120\n The fact is the paradigm that we're using\n\n31:20.120 --> 31:22.000\n is it's not super important\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.080\n if you run into that person only for 10 minutes\n\n31:24.080 --> 31:25.680\n at the grocery store.\n\n31:25.680 --> 31:27.640\n If that's a stranger that you run into 10 minutes\n\n31:27.640 --> 31:28.920\n in this grocery store,\n\n31:28.920 --> 31:30.880\n that's not gonna be relevant for our paradigm\n\n31:30.880 --> 31:33.080\n because our paradigm is not telling you\n\n31:33.080 --> 31:35.000\n who were you around before\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:38.600\n and might therefore have gotten infected by already.\n\n31:38.600 --> 31:40.160\n Ours is about predicting the future.\n\n31:40.160 --> 31:42.680\n We change from, I mean, the standard paradigm was\n\n31:42.680 --> 31:45.200\n what already happened, quick damage control.\n\n31:45.200 --> 31:46.560\n Ours is predict the future.\n\n31:46.560 --> 31:49.280\n If you run into that person once in the grocery store today\n\n31:49.280 --> 31:50.360\n and never see them again,\n\n31:50.360 --> 31:52.520\n it's irrelevant for predicting the future.\n\n31:52.520 --> 31:54.800\n And therefore, for ours, what really matters\n\n31:54.800 --> 31:57.960\n is the many hours around the other person,\n\n31:57.960 --> 31:59.600\n at which point, if you're scanning every five\n\n31:59.600 --> 32:00.640\n to eight minutes.\n\n32:00.640 --> 32:02.040\n That's going to come out in the problem,\n\n32:02.040 --> 32:03.240\n like statistically speaking,\n\n32:03.240 --> 32:05.400\n it's going to come out as a strong relationship\n\n32:05.400 --> 32:08.760\n and a person in the grocery store is going to wash out\n\n32:08.760 --> 32:11.360\n is not an important physical relationship.\n\n32:11.360 --> 32:12.600\n I mean, this is brilliant.\n\n32:14.400 --> 32:15.880\n How difficult is it to make work?\n\n32:15.880 --> 32:19.000\n So you said, one, there's a mathematical component\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.280\n that we just kind of talked about,\n\n32:21.280 --> 32:24.000\n and then there's the user experience component.\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.080\n So how difficult does it to go,\n\n32:26.080 --> 32:28.680\n just like you built the video game, Alien Attack,\n\n32:29.920 --> 32:33.800\n from zero to completion, what's involved?\n\n32:33.800 --> 32:34.920\n How difficult is it?\n\n32:34.920 --> 32:36.720\n So I'm going to answer that question\n\n32:36.720 --> 32:39.360\n in terms of building the product,\n\n32:39.360 --> 32:40.880\n but then I'm also going to acknowledge\n\n32:40.880 --> 32:44.760\n that just having an app doesn't make it useful\n\n32:44.760 --> 32:47.640\n because that's actually maybe the easy part.\n\n32:48.560 --> 32:49.400\n If you know what I mean,\n\n32:49.400 --> 32:50.320\n there's like all of this stuff\n\n32:50.320 --> 32:52.040\n about rollout adoption and awareness,\n\n32:52.040 --> 32:53.760\n but let's focus on the app part first.\n\n32:53.760 --> 32:56.320\n So that's again, why I said the team is incredible.\n\n32:56.320 --> 32:58.840\n So we have a bunch of people who,\n\n32:59.800 --> 33:02.720\n let's just say that the technology that we use to make it\n\n33:02.720 --> 33:04.960\n is not the standard way you make an app.\n\n33:04.960 --> 33:08.680\n If you think about a standard iOS app or Android app,\n\n33:08.680 --> 33:12.120\n those are a user interface that contacts a web server\n\n33:12.120 --> 33:14.080\n and sends some information back and forth.\n\n33:14.080 --> 33:16.000\n We're doing some stuff that has to hook\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:17.880\n into the operating system of saying,\n\n33:17.880 --> 33:19.280\n let's go use Bluetooth for something\n\n33:19.280 --> 33:21.600\n it wasn't really meant for, right?\n\n33:21.600 --> 33:22.960\n So there's that part.\n\n33:22.960 --> 33:24.520\n By the way, what is the app called?\n\n33:24.520 --> 33:27.520\n Oh, it's called Novid, COVID with an N.\n\n33:28.760 --> 33:29.600\n Very nice.\n\n33:29.600 --> 33:31.360\n So you have to hook into Bluetooth.\n\n33:31.360 --> 33:36.240\n You're saying you have to do that beyond the permissions\n\n33:36.240 --> 33:39.560\n that are like at the very surface level\n\n33:39.560 --> 33:40.680\n provided on the phone?\n\n33:40.680 --> 33:42.440\n Well, I don't want to call them permissions.\n\n33:42.440 --> 33:43.280\n I just want to say,\n\n33:43.280 --> 33:45.440\n that's not what you usually do with Bluetooth.\n\n33:45.440 --> 33:46.280\n Gotcha.\n\n33:46.280 --> 33:47.680\n Usually with Bluetooth, you say,\n\n33:47.680 --> 33:49.080\n do I have headphones nearby?\n\n33:49.080 --> 33:49.920\n Yes.\n\n33:49.920 --> 33:50.760\n Okay, I'm done.\n\n33:50.760 --> 33:53.160\n You don't go and say, do I have headphones nearby?\n\n33:53.160 --> 33:55.520\n Or do I have another phone nearby, which is doing something?\n\n33:55.520 --> 33:56.760\n And then keep asking that same question.\n\n33:56.760 --> 33:58.320\n Keep asking the question.\n\n33:58.320 --> 33:59.160\n Right?\n\n33:59.160 --> 34:00.240\n So it's actually not easy.\n\n34:00.240 --> 34:02.160\n And I mean, there were some parts of it,\n\n34:02.160 --> 34:05.840\n which actually a lot of people had tried unsuccessfully.\n\n34:05.840 --> 34:07.960\n Actually, it's known that, for example,\n\n34:07.960 --> 34:11.600\n the UK was trying to do something similar.\n\n34:11.600 --> 34:13.640\n And the problem they ran into was,\n\n34:13.640 --> 34:16.360\n when you program things on iOS,\n\n34:16.360 --> 34:19.320\n iOS is very good at making it hard\n\n34:19.320 --> 34:20.760\n to do things in the background.\n\n34:21.760 --> 34:23.800\n And so there was quite a lot of effort required\n\n34:23.800 --> 34:25.440\n to go and make this thing work.\n\n34:25.440 --> 34:28.160\n So the whole point, this thing would run in the background\n\n34:28.160 --> 34:33.160\n and iOS, I mean, most Android probably as well, right?\n\n34:33.720 --> 34:35.480\n But yeah, iOS certainly makes it difficult\n\n34:35.480 --> 34:36.880\n for something to run in the background,\n\n34:36.880 --> 34:40.400\n especially when it's eating up your battery, right?\n\n34:40.400 --> 34:42.240\n Well, we wanted to make sure we didn't eat up the battery.\n\n34:42.240 --> 34:43.480\n So that one we can,\n\n34:43.480 --> 34:44.920\n we actually are very proud of the fact\n\n34:44.920 --> 34:46.680\n that ours uses very little battery.\n\n34:47.760 --> 34:51.560\n Actually, even if compared to Apple's own system, so.\n\n34:51.560 --> 34:52.400\n Beautiful.\n\n34:52.400 --> 34:54.480\n So what else is required to make this thing work?\n\n34:54.480 --> 34:56.840\n Right, so the key was that you had to do\n\n34:56.840 --> 34:58.800\n a significant amount of work on the actual\n\n34:58.800 --> 35:00.160\n mobile app development,\n\n35:00.160 --> 35:02.120\n which fortunately the team that we brought\n\n35:02.120 --> 35:04.000\n was this kind of general thinkers\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:07.120\n where we would dig in deep into the operating system\n\n35:07.120 --> 35:09.400\n documentation and the API libraries.\n\n35:09.400 --> 35:10.600\n So we got that working.\n\n35:10.600 --> 35:12.280\n But there's another angle, which is,\n\n35:12.280 --> 35:15.000\n you also need the servers to be able to compute fast enough,\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.360\n which is tying back to this old school\n\n35:17.360 --> 35:20.040\n computer programming competitions and math Olympiads.\n\n35:20.040 --> 35:23.000\n In fact, our team that was working on the algorithm\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.440\n and backend side included several people\n\n35:25.440 --> 35:29.320\n who had been in these competitions from before,\n\n35:29.320 --> 35:32.360\n which I happen to know because I do coach the team\n\n35:32.360 --> 35:33.360\n for the math.\n\n35:33.360 --> 35:37.240\n And so we were able to bring people in to build servers,\n\n35:37.240 --> 35:40.120\n a server infrastructure in C++ actually,\n\n35:40.120 --> 35:43.080\n so that we could support significant numbers of people\n\n35:43.080 --> 35:45.360\n without needing tons of servers.\n\n35:45.360 --> 35:48.000\n Is there some distributed algorithms working here\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:51.560\n or you basically have to keep in the same place\n\n35:51.560 --> 35:53.720\n the entire graph as it builds?\n\n35:53.720 --> 35:56.280\n Cause especially the more and more people use it,\n\n35:56.280 --> 35:58.240\n the bigger, the bigger the graph gets.\n\n35:58.240 --> 36:02.280\n I mean, this is very difficult scaling problem, right?\n\n36:02.280 --> 36:05.600\n Ah, so that's actually why this computer algorithm\n\n36:05.600 --> 36:07.120\n competition stuff was handy.\n\n36:07.120 --> 36:11.200\n It's because there are only about seven to eight\n\n36:11.200 --> 36:12.920\n giga people in the world.\n\n36:12.920 --> 36:14.000\n Yeah.\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:15.160\n That's not that many.\n\n36:15.160 --> 36:17.520\n So if you can make your algorithms linear time\n\n36:17.520 --> 36:22.320\n or almost linear time, a computer operates in gigahertz.\n\n36:22.320 --> 36:26.000\n I only need to do one run, one recalculation every hour\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:29.080\n in terms of telling people how far away these dangers are.\n\n36:29.080 --> 36:29.920\n Yes.\n\n36:29.920 --> 36:33.520\n So I suddenly have 3,600 seconds\n\n36:33.520 --> 36:36.520\n and my CPU cores are running in gigahertz.\n\n36:36.520 --> 36:39.520\n And at most they're eight giga people.\n\n36:39.520 --> 36:44.000\n Well, you skipping over the fact that there's N squared\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.840\n potential connections between people.\n\n36:46.840 --> 36:51.400\n So how do you get around the fact that, you know,\n\n36:51.400 --> 36:54.440\n that we, you know, the potential set of relationship\n\n36:54.440 --> 36:56.160\n any one of us could have is a billion.\n\n36:56.160 --> 36:59.200\n So it's a billion times squared.\n\n36:59.200 --> 37:02.720\n That's the potential amount of data you have to be storing\n\n37:02.720 --> 37:05.280\n and computing over and constantly updating.\n\n37:05.280 --> 37:08.120\n So the way we dealt with that is we actually expect\n\n37:08.120 --> 37:10.840\n that the typical network is very sparse.\n\n37:10.840 --> 37:14.840\n The technical term sparse would mean that the average degree\n\n37:14.840 --> 37:17.640\n or the average number of connections that a person has\n\n37:17.640 --> 37:21.160\n is going to be at most like a hundred strong connections\n\n37:21.160 --> 37:22.520\n that you care about.\n\n37:22.520 --> 37:25.520\n If you think of it almost in terms of the heavy hitters,\n\n37:25.520 --> 37:28.200\n actually in most people's lives,\n\n37:28.200 --> 37:29.880\n a hundred, if we just kept track\n\n37:29.880 --> 37:32.440\n of their top hundred interactions,\n\n37:32.440 --> 37:34.240\n that's probably most of the signal.\n\n37:35.480 --> 37:37.680\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n37:37.680 --> 37:40.400\n I'm saddened to think that I might not be even\n\n37:40.400 --> 37:42.040\n in a double digits, but.\n\n37:42.040 --> 37:44.720\n Oh, I was intentionally giving a crazy number\n\n37:44.720 --> 37:46.160\n to account for college students.\n\n37:46.160 --> 37:48.960\n You call, oh, those are the,\n\n37:48.960 --> 37:50.000\n who you call on the heavy hitters,\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.040\n the people who are like the social butterflies.\n\n37:52.040 --> 37:53.680\n Yeah, I need to,\n\n37:54.840 --> 37:56.920\n I'd love to know that information about myself,\n\n37:56.920 --> 38:01.920\n by the way, that, do you expose the graph,\n\n38:01.960 --> 38:04.480\n like how many, like about yourself,\n\n38:04.480 --> 38:06.080\n how many connections you have?\n\n38:06.080 --> 38:07.920\n We do expose to each person\n\n38:07.920 --> 38:09.600\n how many direct connections they have.\n\n38:09.600 --> 38:10.440\n That's great.\n\n38:10.440 --> 38:11.600\n But for privacy purposes,\n\n38:11.600 --> 38:14.120\n we don't tell anybody who their connections,\n\n38:14.120 --> 38:16.000\n like how their connections are interconnected.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:16.880\n Yes, gotcha.\n\n38:16.880 --> 38:19.400\n But at the same time, we do expose also to everyone\n\n38:19.400 --> 38:21.000\n an interesting chart that says,\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:22.840\n here's how many people you have\n\n38:22.840 --> 38:24.400\n that you're connected to directly.\n\n38:24.400 --> 38:26.720\n Here's how many at distance two,\n\n38:26.720 --> 38:27.880\n meaning via people.\n\n38:27.880 --> 38:29.600\n And then here's how many at distance three.\n\n38:29.600 --> 38:30.920\n And the reason we do that,\n\n38:30.920 --> 38:32.880\n is that actually ends up being a dynamic\n\n38:32.880 --> 38:34.440\n that also boosts adoption.\n\n38:34.440 --> 38:36.360\n It drives another feedback loop.\n\n38:36.360 --> 38:38.120\n The reason is because we saw, actually,\n\n38:38.120 --> 38:40.520\n when we deployed this in some universities,\n\n38:40.520 --> 38:42.760\n that when people see on their app\n\n38:42.760 --> 38:46.000\n that they are indirectly connected to hundreds\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:47.600\n or thousands of other people,\n\n38:47.600 --> 38:49.120\n they get excited and they tell other people,\n\n38:49.120 --> 38:50.760\n hey, let's download this app.\n\n38:50.760 --> 38:52.960\n But you know, we also saw in those examples,\n\n38:52.960 --> 38:55.480\n especially looking at the screenshots people gave,\n\n38:55.480 --> 38:58.600\n that is hit as soon as the typical person\n\n38:58.600 --> 39:02.600\n has two or three other direct connections on the system.\n\n39:02.600 --> 39:04.440\n Because that means that our app\n\n39:04.440 --> 39:07.680\n has reached a virality or not of two to three.\n\n39:07.680 --> 39:10.880\n The key is we were making a viral app to fight a virus\n\n39:10.880 --> 39:13.920\n spreading on the same network that the virus spreads on.\n\n39:14.880 --> 39:17.120\n So you're trying to out virus the virus.\n\n39:17.120 --> 39:17.960\n That's right.\n\n39:17.960 --> 39:20.280\n That's exactly right.\n\n39:20.280 --> 39:21.400\n Okay, great.\n\n39:21.400 --> 39:23.640\n What have you learned from this whole experience\n\n39:23.640 --> 39:26.520\n in terms of, let's say for COVID,\n\n39:26.520 --> 39:28.800\n but for future pandemics as well,\n\n39:29.840 --> 39:33.760\n is it possible to use the power information here\n\n39:33.760 --> 39:38.520\n of networked information as a virus spreads and travels\n\n39:38.520 --> 39:41.400\n in order to basically keep the society open?\n\n39:41.400 --> 39:44.840\n Is it possible for people to protect themselves\n\n39:44.840 --> 39:46.200\n with this information?\n\n39:46.200 --> 39:48.920\n Or do you still have to have most,\n\n39:48.920 --> 39:50.680\n like in this overarching policy\n\n39:50.680 --> 39:53.680\n of everybody should stay at home, that kind of thing?\n\n39:53.680 --> 39:55.400\n We are trying to answer that question right now.\n\n39:55.400 --> 39:57.600\n So the answer is we don't know yet,\n\n39:57.600 --> 39:59.320\n but that's actually why we're very happy\n\n39:59.320 --> 40:02.720\n that now the idea has started to become more widely known.\n\n40:02.720 --> 40:04.640\n And we're already starting to collaborate\n\n40:04.640 --> 40:06.520\n with epidemiologists.\n\n40:06.520 --> 40:08.880\n Again, I'm just a mathematician, right?\n\n40:08.880 --> 40:11.040\n And a mathematician should not be the person\n\n40:11.040 --> 40:13.720\n who is telling everybody, this will definitely work.\n\n40:13.720 --> 40:17.680\n But because of the potential power of this approach,\n\n40:17.680 --> 40:19.160\n especially the potential power\n\n40:19.160 --> 40:21.960\n of this being an end game for COVID,\n\n40:22.880 --> 40:26.240\n we have gotten the interest of real researchers.\n\n40:26.240 --> 40:27.720\n And we're now working together\n\n40:27.720 --> 40:30.240\n to try to actually understand the answer to that question.\n\n40:30.240 --> 40:31.600\n Because you see, there's a theory.\n\n40:31.600 --> 40:34.160\n So what I can share is the mathematics of,\n\n40:34.160 --> 40:36.680\n here's why there's some hope that this would work.\n\n40:36.680 --> 40:39.440\n And that's because I'm talking about end game now.\n\n40:39.440 --> 40:41.560\n End game means you have very few cases.\n\n40:41.560 --> 40:43.600\n But everywhere, we're always thinking,\n\n40:43.600 --> 40:46.480\n once there's few cases, then does that mean we now open up?\n\n40:46.480 --> 40:49.560\n Once you open up in the past, then the cases go up again\n\n40:49.560 --> 40:51.440\n until you have to lock down again.\n\n40:51.440 --> 40:54.200\n And now when we talk about the dynamic process that makes,\n\n40:54.200 --> 40:55.880\n it's guaranteeing you always have cases\n\n40:55.880 --> 40:57.160\n until you have the great vaccines,\n\n40:57.160 --> 41:00.680\n which is, we both got vaccinated, this is good.\n\n41:00.680 --> 41:02.520\n But at the same time, why I'm thinking\n\n41:02.520 --> 41:04.360\n this is still important is because we know\n\n41:04.360 --> 41:06.560\n that many vaccine makers have said\n\n41:06.560 --> 41:09.760\n they're preparing for the next dose next year.\n\n41:09.760 --> 41:11.720\n And if we have a perpetual thing\n\n41:11.720 --> 41:14.480\n where you just always need a new vaccine every year,\n\n41:14.480 --> 41:16.280\n it could actually be beneficial to make sure\n\n41:16.280 --> 41:18.800\n we have as many other techniques as possible\n\n41:18.800 --> 41:20.840\n for parts of the world that can't afford,\n\n41:20.840 --> 41:23.160\n for example, that kind of distribution.\n\n41:23.160 --> 41:26.360\n Yeah, so actually, no matter how deadly the virus is,\n\n41:26.360 --> 41:27.720\n no matter how many things,\n\n41:27.720 --> 41:29.680\n whether you have a vaccine or not,\n\n41:29.680 --> 41:31.920\n it's still useful to be having this information.\n\n41:31.920 --> 41:32.760\n Yes.\n\n41:32.760 --> 41:35.880\n Because to stay home or not, depending on how risk,\n\n41:35.880 --> 41:39.160\n I'm a big fan, just like you said, of having the freedom\n\n41:39.160 --> 41:43.240\n for you to decide how risk averse you wanna be, right?\n\n41:43.240 --> 41:44.400\n Depending on your own conditions,\n\n41:44.400 --> 41:47.240\n but also on the state of like what you,\n\n41:47.240 --> 41:50.080\n just how dangerously you like to live.\n\n41:50.080 --> 41:51.960\n So I think that actually makes a lot of sense.\n\n41:51.960 --> 41:54.920\n And I also think that since we're,\n\n41:54.920 --> 41:56.960\n when you think of disease spreading,\n\n41:56.960 --> 42:00.520\n it spreads in aggregate in the sense that\n\n42:00.520 --> 42:04.680\n if there are some people who maybe are more risk tolerant\n\n42:04.680 --> 42:06.480\n because of other things in their life,\n\n42:06.480 --> 42:08.040\n well, there might also be other people\n\n42:08.040 --> 42:09.800\n who are less risk tolerance.\n\n42:09.800 --> 42:12.720\n And then those people decide to isolate.\n\n42:12.720 --> 42:14.520\n But what matters is in the aggregate\n\n42:14.520 --> 42:17.680\n that this R naught of the infection spreading\n\n42:17.680 --> 42:19.000\n drops below one.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.200\n And so the key is if you can empower people\n\n42:21.200 --> 42:23.440\n with that power to make that decision,\n\n42:23.440 --> 42:25.080\n you might actually still be able to drive\n\n42:25.080 --> 42:26.480\n that R naught down below one.\n\n42:27.600 --> 42:30.240\n Yeah, and also, this is me talking,\n\n42:31.480 --> 42:33.720\n people get a little bit nervous, I think,\n\n42:33.720 --> 42:38.280\n with information somehow mapping to privacy violation.\n\n42:38.280 --> 42:42.240\n But first of all, in the approach you're describing,\n\n42:42.240 --> 42:44.600\n that's respecting anonymity.\n\n42:46.240 --> 42:49.240\n But I would love to have information\n\n42:49.240 --> 42:52.760\n from the very beginning, from March and April of last year,\n\n42:54.040 --> 42:59.040\n almost like a map of like where it's risky\n\n42:59.080 --> 43:01.360\n and where it's not to go.\n\n43:01.360 --> 43:05.200\n And not map based on sort of the exact location of people,\n\n43:05.200 --> 43:07.560\n but where people usually hang out kind of thing.\n\n43:07.560 --> 43:12.560\n Just, and maybe not necessarily about actual location,\n\n43:13.080 --> 43:15.240\n but just maybe activities,\n\n43:15.240 --> 43:19.680\n like just to have information about what is good to do\n\n43:19.680 --> 43:23.080\n and not, in terms of like safety,\n\n43:23.080 --> 43:25.440\n is it okay to run outside and not,\n\n43:25.440 --> 43:27.720\n is it okay to go to a restaurant and not,\n\n43:27.720 --> 43:29.640\n I just feel like we're operating in the blind.\n\n43:29.640 --> 43:33.880\n And then what you had is a very imperfect signal,\n\n43:33.880 --> 43:37.160\n which is like basically politicians desperately trying\n\n43:37.160 --> 43:40.040\n to make statements about what is safe and not.\n\n43:40.040 --> 43:41.600\n They don't know what the heck they're doing.\n\n43:41.600 --> 43:44.120\n They have a bunch of smart scientists telling them stuff.\n\n43:44.120 --> 43:47.720\n And the scientists themselves also, very important,\n\n43:47.720 --> 43:49.600\n don't always know what they're doing.\n\n43:49.600 --> 43:54.600\n Epidemiology is not, is as much an art as a science.\n\n43:54.600 --> 43:56.400\n You're desperately trying to predict the future,\n\n43:56.400 --> 43:57.960\n which nobody can do.\n\n43:57.960 --> 44:01.200\n And then you're trying to speak with some level of authority.\n\n44:01.200 --> 44:02.920\n I mean, if I were to criticize scientists,\n\n44:02.920 --> 44:04.440\n they spoke with too much authority.\n\n44:04.440 --> 44:06.480\n It's okay to say, I'm not sure.\n\n44:06.480 --> 44:10.640\n But then they think like, if I say, I'm not sure,\n\n44:10.640 --> 44:12.400\n then there's going to be a distrust.\n\n44:12.400 --> 44:14.480\n What they realize is when you're wrong and you say,\n\n44:14.480 --> 44:16.840\n I'm sure, it's going to lead to more distrust.\n\n44:16.840 --> 44:19.760\n So there's this imperfect, like just chaotic,\n\n44:19.760 --> 44:23.560\n messy system of people trying to figure out\n\n44:23.560 --> 44:25.320\n with very little information.\n\n44:25.320 --> 44:27.880\n And what you're proposing is just a huge amount\n\n44:27.880 --> 44:31.080\n of information, and information is power.\n\n44:31.080 --> 44:34.320\n Is there challenges with adoption that you see\n\n44:34.320 --> 44:36.240\n in the future here?\n\n44:36.240 --> 44:38.640\n So there's, maybe we could speak to,\n\n44:38.640 --> 44:40.520\n there's approaches, I guess, from Google.\n\n44:40.520 --> 44:42.600\n There's different people that have tried\n\n44:42.600 --> 44:44.800\n similar kind of ideas.\n\n44:44.800 --> 44:49.600\n Not, you have quite a novel idea, actually.\n\n44:49.600 --> 44:53.600\n But speaking, the umbrella idea of contact tracing,\n\n44:53.600 --> 44:58.600\n is there something you can comment about\n\n44:58.800 --> 45:02.040\n why their approaches haven't been fully adopted?\n\n45:02.040 --> 45:03.200\n Is there challenges there?\n\n45:03.200 --> 45:06.400\n Is there reasons why Novid might be a better idea\n\n45:06.400 --> 45:09.240\n moving forward, in general, just about adoption?\n\n45:09.240 --> 45:10.680\n Yeah, so first of all, I want to say,\n\n45:10.680 --> 45:13.280\n I always have respect for the methods that other people use.\n\n45:13.280 --> 45:16.160\n And so it's good to see the other people I've been trying.\n\n45:16.160 --> 45:19.040\n But what we have noticed is that the difference\n\n45:19.040 --> 45:22.360\n between our value proposition to the user\n\n45:22.360 --> 45:24.320\n and the value proposition to the user delivered\n\n45:24.320 --> 45:27.800\n by everything that was made before is that,\n\n45:27.800 --> 45:30.480\n unfortunately, the action of installing\n\n45:30.480 --> 45:34.480\n a standard contact tracing app will then tell you\n\n45:34.480 --> 45:37.760\n after you have already been exposed to the disease\n\n45:37.760 --> 45:40.640\n so that you can protect other people from you.\n\n45:40.640 --> 45:43.640\n And what that does to your own direct probability\n\n45:43.640 --> 45:45.720\n of getting sick, if you think about it,\n\n45:45.720 --> 45:47.120\n suppose you were making the decision,\n\n45:47.120 --> 45:50.040\n should I or should I not install one of those apps?\n\n45:50.040 --> 45:53.120\n What does that do to your own probability of getting sick?\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:56.320\n It's close to zero.\n\n45:56.320 --> 46:00.680\n This is the sad thing you're speaking to, not sad.\n\n46:00.680 --> 46:03.280\n I suppose it's the way the world is.\n\n46:03.280 --> 46:06.080\n The only incentive there is to just help other people,\n\n46:06.080 --> 46:09.640\n I suppose, but a much stronger incentive\n\n46:09.640 --> 46:13.160\n is anything that allows you to help yourself.\n\n46:13.160 --> 46:15.520\n Yes, so what I'm saying is that,\n\n46:15.520 --> 46:17.160\n let's just say free market capitalism\n\n46:17.160 --> 46:21.680\n was not based on altruism, I think it's based on,\n\n46:21.680 --> 46:23.280\n if you make a system of incentives\n\n46:23.280 --> 46:26.960\n so that everybody trying to maximize their own situation\n\n46:26.960 --> 46:28.760\n somehow contributes to the whole,\n\n46:28.760 --> 46:31.800\n that's a game theoretic solution to a very hard problem.\n\n46:31.800 --> 46:34.200\n And so this is actually basically mechanism design,\n\n46:34.200 --> 46:36.640\n that we've basically come up with a different mechanism,\n\n46:36.640 --> 46:38.280\n different set of incentives,\n\n46:38.280 --> 46:40.960\n which incentivizes the adoption,\n\n46:40.960 --> 46:43.120\n because actually whenever we've been rolling it out,\n\n46:43.120 --> 46:45.240\n usually the first question we ask people,\n\n46:45.240 --> 46:46.800\n like say in a university is,\n\n46:46.800 --> 46:48.160\n do you know what Novid does?\n\n46:48.160 --> 46:50.640\n And most of them have read about the other apps\n\n46:50.640 --> 46:51.920\n and they say, Oh, Novid will tell you\n\n46:51.920 --> 46:54.120\n after you've been around someone so you can quarantine.\n\n46:54.120 --> 46:55.400\n And we have to explain to them,\n\n46:55.400 --> 46:58.440\n actually, Novid never wants to ask you to quarantine.\n\n46:58.440 --> 46:59.280\n That's not the principle.\n\n46:59.280 --> 47:01.240\n Our principle isn't based on that at all.\n\n47:01.240 --> 47:04.560\n We just want to let you know if something is coming close\n\n47:04.560 --> 47:06.200\n so that you can protect yourself.\n\n47:07.360 --> 47:08.200\n If you want.\n\n47:08.200 --> 47:09.320\n If you want, if you want, if you want.\n\n47:09.320 --> 47:11.320\n And then the quarantine is like, yes,\n\n47:11.320 --> 47:13.440\n in that case, if you're quarantining,\n\n47:13.440 --> 47:16.240\n it's because you're shutting the door from the inside,\n\n47:16.240 --> 47:17.080\n if that makes sense.\n\n47:17.080 --> 47:18.120\n Yes, exactly.\n\n47:18.120 --> 47:18.960\n Exactly.\n\n47:18.960 --> 47:20.080\n I mean, this is brilliant.\n\n47:20.080 --> 47:23.360\n So what do you think the future looks like\n\n47:23.360 --> 47:24.560\n for future pandemics?\n\n47:24.560 --> 47:26.680\n What's your plan with Novid?\n\n47:26.680 --> 47:28.760\n What's your plan with these set of ideas?\n\n47:28.760 --> 47:31.160\n I am actually still an academic and a researcher.\n\n47:31.160 --> 47:33.360\n So the biggest work I'm working on right now\n\n47:33.360 --> 47:35.560\n is to try to build as many collaborations\n\n47:35.560 --> 47:39.120\n with other public health researchers at other universities\n\n47:39.120 --> 47:42.160\n to actually work on pilot deployments together\n\n47:42.160 --> 47:43.040\n in various places.\n\n47:43.040 --> 47:44.080\n That's the goal.\n\n47:44.080 --> 47:45.960\n That's actually ongoing work right now.\n\n47:45.960 --> 47:47.800\n And so, for example, if anyone's watching this\n\n47:47.800 --> 47:49.760\n and you happen to be a public health researcher\n\n47:49.760 --> 47:52.360\n and you want to be involved in something like this,\n\n47:52.360 --> 47:55.240\n I'm just gonna say, I'm still incentive thinking.\n\n47:55.240 --> 47:57.320\n There's something in it for the researchers too.\n\n47:57.320 --> 47:59.360\n This could open up an entire new way\n\n47:59.360 --> 48:00.360\n of controlling disease.\n\n48:00.360 --> 48:01.920\n That's my hope.\n\n48:01.920 --> 48:03.560\n I mean, it might actually be true.\n\n48:03.560 --> 48:06.360\n And people who are involved in figuring out\n\n48:06.360 --> 48:08.040\n how to make this work,\n\n48:08.040 --> 48:09.960\n well, it could actually be good for their careers too.\n\n48:09.960 --> 48:11.080\n I always have to think like,\n\n48:11.080 --> 48:12.680\n if a researcher was getting involved,\n\n48:12.680 --> 48:14.240\n what are they getting out of it?\n\n48:14.240 --> 48:16.600\n Oh, so you mean like from a research perspective,\n\n48:16.600 --> 48:20.200\n you can like publications and sets of ideas\n\n48:20.200 --> 48:25.200\n about how to, from a sort of network theory perspective,\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:30.080\n understand how we control the spread of a pandemic.\n\n48:30.080 --> 48:31.680\n Yes, and what I'm doing right now\n\n48:31.680 --> 48:33.720\n is this is basically interdisciplinary research\n\n48:33.720 --> 48:35.960\n where maybe our side is bringing the technology\n\n48:35.960 --> 48:37.040\n and the network theory,\n\n48:37.040 --> 48:39.200\n and the missing parts are epidemiology\n\n48:39.200 --> 48:40.960\n and public health expertise.\n\n48:40.960 --> 48:42.840\n And if the two things start to join,\n\n48:42.840 --> 48:45.320\n also because everywhere that you deploy,\n\n48:45.320 --> 48:46.800\n let's just say that the world is different\n\n48:46.800 --> 48:49.400\n in the Philippines as it is in the United States.\n\n48:49.400 --> 48:52.040\n And just the natures of the locality\n\n48:52.040 --> 48:53.560\n would mean that someone like me\n\n48:53.560 --> 48:55.280\n should not be trying to figure out how to do that.\n\n48:55.280 --> 48:56.840\n But if we can work with the researchers\n\n48:56.840 --> 48:57.840\n who are based there,\n\n48:57.840 --> 48:59.720\n now suddenly we might come up with a solution\n\n48:59.720 --> 49:01.960\n that will help scale in parts of the world\n\n49:01.960 --> 49:04.680\n where they aren't all getting the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines\n\n49:04.680 --> 49:07.400\n which cost like $20 a pop in the US.\n\n49:07.400 --> 49:09.240\n So if they want to participate,\n\n49:09.240 --> 49:10.720\n who do they reach out to?\n\n49:10.720 --> 49:11.640\n Oh, that would just be us.\n\n49:11.640 --> 49:13.600\n I mean, the novid.org website has...\n\n49:13.600 --> 49:14.440\n Novid.org.\n\n49:14.440 --> 49:16.880\n It has a feedback reach out form.\n\n49:16.880 --> 49:18.840\n And actually we are, I mean, again,\n\n49:18.840 --> 49:21.040\n this is the DNA of being a researcher.\n\n49:21.040 --> 49:23.320\n I am actually very excited by the idea\n\n49:23.320 --> 49:25.560\n that this could contribute knowledge\n\n49:25.560 --> 49:28.240\n that will outlast all of our generations,\n\n49:28.240 --> 49:29.960\n like all of our lifetimes.\n\n49:29.960 --> 49:30.800\n There you go.\n\n49:30.800 --> 49:33.200\n Reach out to novid.org.\n\n49:34.440 --> 49:36.040\n What about individual people?\n\n49:36.040 --> 49:37.680\n Should they install the app and try it out?\n\n49:37.680 --> 49:40.080\n Or is this really geographically restricted?\n\n49:40.080 --> 49:42.040\n Oh, yeah, I didn't come on here to tell everyone\n\n49:42.040 --> 49:42.880\n to install the app.\n\n49:42.880 --> 49:44.760\n I did not come to tell everyone to install the app\n\n49:44.760 --> 49:46.440\n because it works best\n\n49:46.440 --> 49:49.400\n if your local health authority is working with us.\n\n49:49.400 --> 49:50.240\n Gotcha.\n\n49:50.240 --> 49:51.080\n There's a reason.\n\n49:51.080 --> 49:53.440\n It's because, this is back to the game theory.\n\n49:54.720 --> 49:57.120\n If anyone could just say, I'm positive,\n\n49:58.320 --> 50:01.840\n the high school senior prank would be to say that\n\n50:01.840 --> 50:03.960\n we have a massive outbreak on finals week.\n\n50:03.960 --> 50:05.240\n Let's not have final exams.\n\n50:05.240 --> 50:06.640\n So the way that our system works,\n\n50:06.640 --> 50:08.760\n it actually borrows some ideas, not borrows,\n\n50:08.760 --> 50:10.280\n we came up with them independently.\n\n50:10.280 --> 50:13.240\n But this idea is similar to what Google and Apple do,\n\n50:13.240 --> 50:14.880\n which is that if the local health authority\n\n50:14.880 --> 50:16.800\n is working with this, they can,\n\n50:16.800 --> 50:17.960\n for everyone who's positive,\n\n50:17.960 --> 50:20.680\n give them a passcode that expires in a short time.\n\n50:20.680 --> 50:23.600\n So for ours, if you're on the app and saying, I'm positive,\n\n50:23.600 --> 50:25.120\n you can either just say that,\n\n50:25.120 --> 50:26.800\n and that's called unverified,\n\n50:26.800 --> 50:28.360\n or you can enter in one of these codes\n\n50:28.360 --> 50:30.280\n that you got from the local health authority.\n\n50:30.280 --> 50:32.440\n So basically, for anyone who's watching this,\n\n50:32.440 --> 50:34.000\n it's not that you should just go and download it\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:35.280\n unless you want to go and look at it.\n\n50:35.280 --> 50:36.120\n That's cool.\n\n50:36.120 --> 50:37.480\n But if you, on the other hand,\n\n50:37.480 --> 50:39.880\n if you happen to know anyone at the local health authority,\n\n50:39.880 --> 50:42.640\n which is trying to figure out how to handle COVID,\n\n50:42.640 --> 50:44.280\n well then, I mean, we'd be very happy\n\n50:44.280 --> 50:45.560\n to also work with you.\n\n50:46.440 --> 50:47.280\n Gotcha.\n\n50:47.280 --> 50:49.120\n So the verified there is really important\n\n50:49.120 --> 50:51.320\n because you're maintaining anonymity.\n\n50:51.320 --> 50:52.160\n And because of that,\n\n50:52.160 --> 50:54.600\n you have to have some source of verification\n\n50:54.600 --> 50:59.080\n in order to make sure that it's not possible to manipulate\n\n50:59.080 --> 51:02.040\n because it's ultimately about trust and information.\n\n51:02.040 --> 51:06.120\n So it could be, verification is really important there.\n\n51:06.120 --> 51:07.960\n So basically, individual people should\n\n51:09.480 --> 51:11.280\n ask their local health authorities\n\n51:11.280 --> 51:13.800\n to sign up to contact you.\n\n51:15.040 --> 51:16.320\n I hope this spreads.\n\n51:16.320 --> 51:18.680\n I hope this spreads for future pandemics\n\n51:18.680 --> 51:21.440\n because I'm really, it's the amount,\n\n51:21.440 --> 51:25.600\n the millions of people who are hurt by this,\n\n51:25.600 --> 51:28.720\n I think our response to the virus,\n\n51:28.720 --> 51:30.040\n economically speaking,\n\n51:30.040 --> 51:32.520\n the number of people who lost their dream,\n\n51:32.520 --> 51:35.120\n lost their jobs, but also lost their dream.\n\n51:35.120 --> 51:38.400\n Entrepreneurs, jobs often give meaning.\n\n51:38.400 --> 51:41.080\n There's people who financially and psychologically\n\n51:41.080 --> 51:42.760\n are suffering because of our,\n\n51:43.760 --> 51:47.440\n I'll say, incompetent response to the virus\n\n51:47.440 --> 51:49.760\n across the world, but certainly the United States,\n\n51:49.760 --> 51:53.960\n that should be the beacon of entrepreneurial hope\n\n51:53.960 --> 51:54.800\n for the world.\n\n51:54.800 --> 51:59.800\n So I hope that we'll be able to respond\n\n52:00.600 --> 52:02.760\n to these kinds of events much better in the future.\n\n52:02.760 --> 52:05.040\n And this is exactly the right kind of idea.\n\n52:05.040 --> 52:07.240\n And now is the time to do the investment.\n\n52:08.280 --> 52:13.040\n Let's step back to the beauty of mathematics.\n\n52:13.040 --> 52:16.040\n Maybe ask the big, silly question first,\n\n52:16.040 --> 52:19.800\n which is, what do you find beautiful about mathematics?\n\n52:20.840 --> 52:25.840\n I think that being able to look at a complicated problem,\n\n52:26.880 --> 52:28.560\n which looks unsolvable,\n\n52:28.560 --> 52:30.800\n and then to be able to change the perspective\n\n52:30.800 --> 52:32.480\n to come from a different angle\n\n52:32.480 --> 52:36.160\n and suddenly see that there's a nice solution.\n\n52:36.160 --> 52:37.920\n I don't mean that every problem in math\n\n52:37.920 --> 52:39.160\n is supposed to be this way,\n\n52:39.160 --> 52:40.920\n but I think that these reframings\n\n52:40.920 --> 52:42.160\n and changing of perspectives\n\n52:42.160 --> 52:44.640\n that cause difficult things to get simplified\n\n52:44.640 --> 52:48.600\n and crystallized and factored in certain ways is beautiful.\n\n52:48.600 --> 52:50.920\n Actually, that's related to what we were just talking about\n\n52:50.920 --> 52:52.640\n with even this fighting pandemics.\n\n52:52.640 --> 52:57.640\n The crystal idea was just quantify proximity\n\n52:57.840 --> 53:01.680\n by the number of relationships in the physical network,\n\n53:01.680 --> 53:04.960\n instead of just by the feet and meters, right?\n\n53:04.960 --> 53:07.360\n It's just that if you change that perspective,\n\n53:07.360 --> 53:09.240\n now all of these things follow.\n\n53:09.240 --> 53:12.280\n And so mathematics to me is beautiful\n\n53:12.280 --> 53:15.000\n in the pure sense just for that.\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:17.560\n Yeah, it's quite interesting to see a human civilization\n\n53:17.560 --> 53:20.040\n as a network, as a graph,\n\n53:20.040 --> 53:25.040\n and our relationships as kind of edges in that graph.\n\n53:25.240 --> 53:29.360\n And to then do, outside of just pandemic,\n\n53:29.360 --> 53:31.880\n do interesting inferences based on that.\n\n53:33.760 --> 53:36.920\n This is true for like Twitter, social networks and so on,\n\n53:36.920 --> 53:40.080\n how we expand the kind of things we talk about,\n\n53:40.080 --> 53:42.200\n think about sort of politically,\n\n53:42.200 --> 53:44.680\n if you have this little bubble, quote unquote,\n\n53:44.680 --> 53:46.880\n of ideas that you play with,\n\n53:46.880 --> 53:50.200\n it's nice from a recommender system perspective,\n\n53:50.200 --> 53:52.000\n how do you jump out of those bubbles?\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:53.600\n It's really fascinating.\n\n53:53.600 --> 53:57.520\n YouTube was working on that, Twitter's working on that,\n\n53:57.520 --> 53:59.680\n but not always so successfully,\n\n53:59.680 --> 54:02.680\n but there's a lot of interesting work\n\n54:02.680 --> 54:05.160\n from a mathematical and a psychological,\n\n54:05.160 --> 54:08.560\n sociological perspective there within those graphs.\n\n54:09.520 --> 54:13.360\n But if we look at the cleanest formulation of that,\n\n54:13.360 --> 54:16.280\n of looking at a problem from a different perspective,\n\n54:16.280 --> 54:17.360\n you're also involved\n\n54:17.360 --> 54:20.200\n with the International Mathematics Olympiad,\n\n54:20.200 --> 54:27.640\n which takes small, clean problems that are really hard,\n\n54:27.640 --> 54:31.120\n but once you look at them differently, can become easy.\n\n54:31.120 --> 54:36.320\n But that little jump of innovation is the entire trick.\n\n54:36.320 --> 54:38.560\n So maybe at the high level,\n\n54:38.560 --> 54:41.480\n can you say what is the International Mathematical Olympiad?\n\n54:41.480 --> 54:44.600\n Sure, so this is the competition\n\n54:44.600 --> 54:47.840\n for people who aren't yet in college, math competition,\n\n54:47.840 --> 54:50.720\n which is the most prestigious one in the entire world.\n\n54:50.720 --> 54:52.720\n It's the Olympics of mathematics,\n\n54:52.720 --> 54:55.040\n but only for people who aren't yet in college.\n\n54:55.040 --> 54:58.000\n Now, the kinds of questions that they ask you to do\n\n54:58.000 --> 54:59.600\n are not computational.\n\n54:59.600 --> 55:02.400\n Usually you're not supposed to find that the answer is 42.\n\n55:02.400 --> 55:03.760\n Right?\n\n55:03.760 --> 55:07.280\n Instead, you're supposed to explain why something is true.\n\n55:07.280 --> 55:09.840\n And the problem is that at the beginning,\n\n55:09.840 --> 55:11.560\n when you look at each of the questions,\n\n55:11.560 --> 55:13.560\n first of all, you have four and a half hours\n\n55:13.560 --> 55:16.080\n to solve three questions, and this is one day,\n\n55:16.080 --> 55:16.920\n and then you have a second day,\n\n55:16.920 --> 55:19.360\n which is four and a half hours, three questions.\n\n55:19.360 --> 55:20.600\n But when you look at the questions,\n\n55:20.600 --> 55:21.440\n they're all asking you,\n\n55:21.440 --> 55:23.240\n explain why the following thing is true,\n\n55:23.240 --> 55:25.160\n which you've never seen before.\n\n55:25.160 --> 55:27.360\n And by the way, even though there are six questions,\n\n55:27.360 --> 55:29.120\n if you solve any one of them, you're a genius\n\n55:29.120 --> 55:30.320\n and you get an honorable mention.\n\n55:30.320 --> 55:32.560\n So this is hard to solve.\n\n55:32.560 --> 55:35.280\n So what about, is it one person, is it a team?\n\n55:35.280 --> 55:38.720\n Ah, so each country can send six people\n\n55:38.720 --> 55:42.320\n and the score of the country is actually unofficial.\n\n55:42.320 --> 55:45.360\n There's not an official country versus country system,\n\n55:45.360 --> 55:47.480\n although everyone just adds up the point scores\n\n55:47.480 --> 55:48.760\n of the six people and they say,\n\n55:48.760 --> 55:51.440\n well, now which country stacked up where?\n\n55:51.440 --> 55:53.400\n Yeah, so maybe as a side comment,\n\n55:53.400 --> 55:56.560\n I should say that there's a bunch of countries,\n\n55:56.560 --> 55:59.480\n including the former Soviet Union and Russia,\n\n55:59.480 --> 56:03.440\n where I grew up, where this is one of the\n\n56:04.320 --> 56:08.360\n most important competitions that the country participates in.\n\n56:08.360 --> 56:11.880\n It was a source of pride for a lot of the country.\n\n56:11.880 --> 56:14.400\n You look at the Olympic sports,\n\n56:14.400 --> 56:17.080\n like wrestling, weightlifting,\n\n56:17.080 --> 56:20.280\n there's certain sports and hockey\n\n56:20.280 --> 56:24.960\n that Russia and the Soviet Union truly took pride in.\n\n56:24.960 --> 56:28.600\n And actually the Mathematical Olympiad,\n\n56:28.600 --> 56:30.880\n it was one of them for many years.\n\n56:30.880 --> 56:32.560\n It's still one of them.\n\n56:32.560 --> 56:33.720\n And that's kind of fascinating.\n\n56:33.720 --> 56:36.680\n We don't think about it this way in the United States.\n\n56:36.680 --> 56:38.200\n Maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n56:38.200 --> 56:42.360\n but it's not nearly as popular in the United States\n\n56:42.360 --> 56:45.560\n in terms of its integration into the culture,\n\n56:45.560 --> 56:49.080\n into just basic conversation, into the pride.\n\n56:49.080 --> 56:52.360\n Like, if you won an Olympic gold medal\n\n56:52.360 --> 56:56.080\n or if you win the Super Bowl, you can walk around proud.\n\n56:56.080 --> 56:57.040\n I think that was the case\n\n56:57.040 --> 56:59.200\n with the Mathematical Olympiad in Russia.\n\n56:59.200 --> 57:03.040\n Not as much the case in the United States, I think.\n\n57:03.040 --> 57:04.880\n So I just wanna give that a little aside\n\n57:04.880 --> 57:07.520\n because beating anybody from Russia,\n\n57:07.520 --> 57:09.400\n from the Eastern Republic or from China\n\n57:09.400 --> 57:11.840\n is very, very difficult.\n\n57:11.840 --> 57:13.520\n Like, if I remember correctly,\n\n57:14.880 --> 57:18.880\n there's people, this was a multiyear training process.\n\n57:18.880 --> 57:20.680\n They train hard.\n\n57:20.680 --> 57:25.040\n And this is everything that they're focused on.\n\n57:25.040 --> 57:29.320\n My dad was a participant in this.\n\n57:29.320 --> 57:33.120\n And it's, I mean, it's as serious as Olympic sports.\n\n57:33.120 --> 57:34.520\n You think about like gymnastics,\n\n57:34.520 --> 57:36.600\n like young athletes participating in gymnastics.\n\n57:36.600 --> 57:38.920\n This is as serious as that, if not more serious.\n\n57:38.920 --> 57:41.360\n So I just wanna give that a little bit of context\n\n57:41.360 --> 57:44.640\n because we're talking about serious high level math,\n\n57:44.640 --> 57:46.360\n athletics almost here.\n\n57:46.360 --> 57:49.800\n Yeah, and actually I also think that it made sense\n\n57:49.800 --> 57:51.400\n from the Soviet Union's perspective\n\n57:51.400 --> 57:55.480\n because if you look at what these people do eventually,\n\n57:55.480 --> 57:58.800\n even though, let's look at the USSR's\n\n57:58.800 --> 58:00.600\n International Math Olympiad record.\n\n58:00.600 --> 58:03.080\n Even though they, I say, even though they won\n\n58:03.080 --> 58:05.280\n a lot of awards at the high school thing,\n\n58:05.280 --> 58:07.800\n many of them went on to do incredible things\n\n58:07.800 --> 58:10.600\n in research mathematics or research other things.\n\n58:10.600 --> 58:13.000\n And that's showing the generalization,\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.960\n generalizability of what they were working on.\n\n58:15.960 --> 58:20.160\n Because ultimately we're just playing with ideas\n\n58:20.160 --> 58:22.360\n of how to prove things.\n\n58:22.360 --> 58:26.040\n And if you get pretty good at inventing creative ways\n\n58:26.040 --> 58:29.040\n to turn problems apart, split them apart,\n\n58:29.040 --> 58:34.040\n observe neat ways to turn messy things into simple crystals.\n\n58:34.080 --> 58:36.200\n Well, if you're gonna try to solve any real problem\n\n58:36.200 --> 58:39.240\n in the real world, that could be a really handy tool too.\n\n58:39.240 --> 58:41.160\n So I don't think it was a bad investment.\n\n58:41.160 --> 58:44.920\n I think it clearly worked well for Soviet Union.\n\n58:44.920 --> 58:47.120\n Yeah, so this is interesting.\n\n58:47.120 --> 58:48.600\n People sometimes ask me, you know,\n\n58:48.600 --> 58:52.080\n you go up and under communism, you know,\n\n58:52.080 --> 58:54.040\n was there anything good about communism?\n\n58:55.560 --> 58:58.120\n And it's difficult for me to talk about it\n\n58:58.120 --> 59:00.800\n because it's not, communism is one of those things\n\n59:00.800 --> 59:02.920\n that's looked down on like without,\n\n59:02.920 --> 59:05.360\n in absolutist terms currently.\n\n59:05.360 --> 59:07.360\n But you could still, in my perspective,\n\n59:07.360 --> 59:09.520\n talk about the actual, forget communism\n\n59:09.520 --> 59:11.760\n or whatever the actual term is,\n\n59:11.760 --> 59:16.760\n but you know, certain ways that the society functioned\n\n59:16.760 --> 59:18.120\n that we can learn lessons from.\n\n59:18.120 --> 59:20.280\n And one of the things in the Soviet Union\n\n59:20.280 --> 59:25.160\n that was highly prized is knowledge,\n\n59:25.160 --> 59:27.280\n not even knowledge, it's wisdom\n\n59:27.280 --> 59:32.280\n and the skill of invention, of innovation at a young age.\n\n59:34.120 --> 59:37.240\n So we're not talking about a selection process\n\n59:37.240 --> 59:40.440\n where you pick the best students in the school\n\n59:40.440 --> 59:44.120\n to do the mathematics or to read literature.\n\n59:44.120 --> 59:47.000\n It's like, everybody did it.\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.920\n Everybody, it was almost treated\n\n59:49.920 --> 59:53.000\n as if anyone could be the next Einstein,\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.560\n anybody could be the next, I don't know,\n\n59:55.560 --> 59:56.920\n Hemingway, James Joyce.\n\n59:56.920 --> 1:00:01.200\n And so you're forcing an education on the populace\n\n1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:03.960\n and a rigorous deep education,\n\n1:00:03.960 --> 1:00:06.440\n like as opposed to kind of like,\n\n1:00:06.440 --> 1:00:10.320\n oh, we wanna make sure we teach\n\n1:00:10.320 --> 1:00:12.440\n to the weakest student in the class,\n\n1:00:14.240 --> 1:00:16.960\n which American systems can sometimes do\n\n1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:19.360\n because we don't wanna leave anyone behind.\n\n1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:24.360\n The Russian system was anyone can be the strongest student\n\n1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:26.840\n and we're gonna teach you the strongest student\n\n1:00:26.840 --> 1:00:30.840\n and we're going to pretend or force everybody,\n\n1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:32.880\n even the weakest student to be strong.\n\n1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:35.240\n And what that results in, it's obviously,\n\n1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:36.480\n this is what people talk about,\n\n1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:38.120\n is a huge amount of pressure.\n\n1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:40.640\n Like it's psychologically very difficult.\n\n1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:42.640\n This is why people struggle when they go to MIT,\n\n1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:44.400\n this very competitive environment.\n\n1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:46.080\n It can be very psychologically difficult,\n\n1:00:46.080 --> 1:00:47.360\n but at the same time,\n\n1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:49.800\n it's bringing out the best out of people.\n\n1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:53.200\n And that mathematics was certainly one of those things.\n\n1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:54.640\n And exactly what you're saying,\n\n1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:56.360\n which kind of clicked with me just now,\n\n1:00:56.360 --> 1:01:00.760\n as opposed to kind of a spelling bee in the United States,\n\n1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:03.360\n which I guess you spell, I'm horrible at this,\n\n1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:04.960\n but it's a competition about spelling,\n\n1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:07.160\n which I'm not sure, but you could argue\n\n1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:10.000\n it doesn't generalize well to the future skills.\n\n1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:13.320\n Mathematics, especially this kind of mathematics\n\n1:01:13.320 --> 1:01:17.120\n is essentially formalized competition of invention,\n\n1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:21.760\n of creating new ideas.\n\n1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:23.960\n And that generalizes really, really well.\n\n1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:25.800\n So that's quite brilliantly put.\n\n1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:27.320\n I didn't really think about that.\n\n1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:29.160\n So this is not just about the competition.\n\n1:01:29.160 --> 1:01:31.960\n This is about developing minds\n\n1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:36.960\n that will come to do some incredible stuff in the future.\n\n1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:38.640\n Yeah, actually, I want to respond\n\n1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:39.600\n to a couple of things there.\n\n1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:42.000\n The first one, this one, which is this notion\n\n1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:43.800\n of whether or not that is possible\n\n1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:46.280\n in a non authoritarian regime.\n\n1:01:46.280 --> 1:01:47.120\n I think it is.\n\n1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:49.520\n And that's actually why I spent some of my efforts\n\n1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:51.040\n before the COVID thing,\n\n1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:53.240\n actually trying to work towards there.\n\n1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:55.680\n The reason is because if you think about it,\n\n1:01:55.680 --> 1:01:57.360\n let's say in America,\n\n1:01:57.360 --> 1:01:58.840\n lots of people are pretty serious\n\n1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:01.160\n about training very hard for football,\n\n1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:02.520\n or baseball, or basketball.\n\n1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:04.040\n Basketball is very, very accessible,\n\n1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:05.840\n but lots of people are doing that.\n\n1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:06.680\n Why?\n\n1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:09.880\n Well, actually, I think that what was going on\n\n1:02:09.880 --> 1:02:13.520\n with the authoritarian thing was at least the message\n\n1:02:13.520 --> 1:02:17.880\n that was universally sent was being a good thinker\n\n1:02:17.880 --> 1:02:21.800\n and a creator of ideas is a good thing.\n\n1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:23.360\n Yes, exactly.\n\n1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:26.920\n There's no reason why that message can't be sent everywhere.\n\n1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:28.680\n And I think it actually should be.\n\n1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:29.720\n So that's the first thing.\n\n1:02:29.720 --> 1:02:32.600\n The second thing is what you commented about this thing\n\n1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:35.720\n about the generalizable skill\n\n1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:37.960\n and what could people do with Olympiads afterwards.\n\n1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:40.360\n So that's actually my interest in the whole thing.\n\n1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:45.360\n I don't just coach students how to do problems.\n\n1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:47.160\n In fact, I'm not even the best person for that.\n\n1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:49.480\n I'm not the best at solving these problems.\n\n1:02:49.480 --> 1:02:50.800\n There are other people who are much better\n\n1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:53.320\n at making problems and teaching people how to solve problems.\n\n1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:57.160\n In fact, when the Mathematical Association of America,\n\n1:02:57.160 --> 1:02:58.640\n which is the group which is in charge\n\n1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:01.280\n of the US participation in these Olympiads,\n\n1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:04.320\n when they were deciding whether or not to put me in\n\n1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:06.920\n back in 2013 as the head coach,\n\n1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:09.240\n I had a conversation with their executive director\n\n1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:12.680\n where I commented that we might do worse\n\n1:03:12.680 --> 1:03:15.080\n because my position was I don't,\n\n1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:17.680\n I mean, I actually didn't want to focus on winning.\n\n1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:19.840\n I said, if you're going to let me work\n\n1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:24.400\n with 60 very strong minds as picked through this system,\n\n1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:26.080\n because the coach works with these,\n\n1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:27.680\n gets to run a camp for these students.\n\n1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:30.400\n I said, I'm actually not going to define my success\n\n1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:33.080\n in terms of winning this contest.\n\n1:03:33.080 --> 1:03:36.040\n I said, I wanted to maximize the number of the students\n\n1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:39.120\n that I read about in the New York Times in 20 years.\n\n1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:41.520\n And the executive director\n\n1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:44.000\n of the Mathematical Association of America\n\n1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:45.840\n was fully in support of this\n\n1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:48.000\n because that's also how their philosophy is.\n\n1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:49.840\n So in America, the way we run this\n\n1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:52.920\n is we're actually not just training to win,\n\n1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:54.840\n even though the students are very good\n\n1:03:54.840 --> 1:03:56.440\n and they can win anyway.\n\n1:03:56.440 --> 1:03:59.120\n One reason, for example, I went and even did the COVID thing\n\n1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:00.560\n involving quite a few of them\n\n1:04:01.560 --> 1:04:04.280\n is so that hopefully some of them get ideas\n\n1:04:04.280 --> 1:04:06.520\n because in 20, 30 years, I won't have the energy\n\n1:04:06.520 --> 1:04:08.520\n or the insight to solve problems.\n\n1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:10.480\n We'll have another catastrophe.\n\n1:04:10.480 --> 1:04:13.160\n And hopefully some of these people will step up and do it.\n\n1:04:13.160 --> 1:04:14.960\n And ultimately have that longterm impact.\n\n1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:17.280\n I wonder if this is scalable to,\n\n1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:20.320\n because that's such a great metric for education,\n\n1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:27.320\n not how to get an A on the test, but how to have,\n\n1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:31.320\n how to be on the cover of New York Times\n\n1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:32.760\n for inventing something new.\n\n1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:37.360\n And do you think that's generalizable to education\n\n1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:39.080\n beyond just this particular Olympia?\n\n1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:42.760\n Like, even you saying this feels like a rare statement,\n\n1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:45.920\n almost like a radical statement as a goal for education.\n\n1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:48.800\n So actually the way I teach my classes at Carnegie Mellon,\n\n1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:51.280\n which I will admit right away is not equivalent\n\n1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:52.440\n to the average in the world,\n\n1:04:52.440 --> 1:04:56.280\n but it's already not just the top 60 in the country\n\n1:04:56.280 --> 1:04:58.120\n as picked by something.\n\n1:04:58.120 --> 1:04:58.960\n Let me just explain.\n\n1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:01.480\n I have exams in my class, which are 90% of the grade.\n\n1:05:01.480 --> 1:05:02.840\n So the exams are the whole thing,\n\n1:05:02.840 --> 1:05:03.920\n or most of the whole thing.\n\n1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:06.640\n And the way that I let students prepare for the exams\n\n1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:08.880\n is I show them all the problems I've ever given\n\n1:05:08.880 --> 1:05:10.360\n on the previous exams.\n\n1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:12.680\n And the exam that they will take is open notes.\n\n1:05:12.680 --> 1:05:13.760\n They can take all the notes they want\n\n1:05:13.760 --> 1:05:14.800\n on the previous problems.\n\n1:05:14.800 --> 1:05:17.240\n And the guarantee is that the exam problems this time\n\n1:05:17.240 --> 1:05:18.840\n will have no overlap with anything\n\n1:05:18.840 --> 1:05:21.000\n you have seen me give in the past,\n\n1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:24.400\n as well as no overlap with anything I taught in the class.\n\n1:05:24.400 --> 1:05:26.080\n So the entire exam is invention.\n\n1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:28.600\n Wow.\n\n1:05:28.600 --> 1:05:29.760\n But that's how I go, right?\n\n1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:33.240\n My point is I have explained to people when I teach you,\n\n1:05:33.240 --> 1:05:36.720\n I don't want you to have remembered a method I showed you.\n\n1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:39.320\n I want you to have learned enough about this area\n\n1:05:39.320 --> 1:05:40.880\n that if you face a new question,\n\n1:05:40.880 --> 1:05:42.480\n which I came up with the night before\n\n1:05:42.480 --> 1:05:43.640\n by thinking about like,\n\n1:05:43.640 --> 1:05:46.200\n what could I ask that I have never asked before?\n\n1:05:46.200 --> 1:05:47.040\n Oh, that's cute.\n\n1:05:47.040 --> 1:05:48.040\n That's what the answer is.\n\n1:05:48.040 --> 1:05:49.160\n Aha, that's an exam problem.\n\n1:05:49.160 --> 1:05:51.320\n That's exactly what I do before the exam.\n\n1:05:51.320 --> 1:05:53.840\n And then that's what I want them to learn.\n\n1:05:53.840 --> 1:05:56.080\n And the first exam, usually people have a rough time\n\n1:05:56.080 --> 1:05:58.400\n because it's like, what kind of crazy class is this?\n\n1:05:58.400 --> 1:06:01.920\n The professor doesn't teach you anything for the exam.\n\n1:06:01.920 --> 1:06:03.440\n But then by the second or third,\n\n1:06:03.440 --> 1:06:05.280\n and by the time they finished the class,\n\n1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:09.520\n they have learned how to solve anything in the area.\n\n1:06:09.520 --> 1:06:10.360\n How to invent.\n\n1:06:10.360 --> 1:06:12.240\n How to invent in that area, yeah.\n\n1:06:12.240 --> 1:06:15.520\n Can we walk back to the Mathematical Olympiad?\n\n1:06:15.520 --> 1:06:17.560\n What's the scoring and format like?\n\n1:06:18.520 --> 1:06:20.840\n And also what does it take to win?\n\n1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:24.280\n So the way it works is that each of the six students\n\n1:06:25.640 --> 1:06:27.800\n do the problems and there are six problems.\n\n1:06:27.800 --> 1:06:29.560\n All the problems are equally weighted.\n\n1:06:29.560 --> 1:06:31.480\n So each one's worth seven points.\n\n1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:33.400\n That means that your maximum score\n\n1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:35.000\n is six problems times seven points,\n\n1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.480\n which is the nice number of 42.\n\n1:06:37.480 --> 1:06:40.360\n And now the way that they're scored by the way\n\n1:06:40.360 --> 1:06:41.680\n is there's partial credit.\n\n1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:43.200\n So the question is asking you,\n\n1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:46.360\n explain why this weird fact is true.\n\n1:06:46.360 --> 1:06:48.720\n Okay, if you explain why you get seven points.\n\n1:06:48.720 --> 1:06:51.320\n If you make minor mistake, maybe you get six points.\n\n1:06:51.320 --> 1:06:53.840\n But if you don't succeed in explaining why,\n\n1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:57.960\n but you explain some other true fact,\n\n1:06:57.960 --> 1:07:02.200\n which is along the way of proving it,\n\n1:07:02.200 --> 1:07:03.960\n then you get partial credit.\n\n1:07:03.960 --> 1:07:05.680\n And actually now this is tricky\n\n1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:07.640\n because how do you score such a thing?\n\n1:07:07.640 --> 1:07:10.800\n It's not like the answer was 72\n\n1:07:10.800 --> 1:07:13.160\n and you wrote 71 and it's close, right?\n\n1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:15.280\n The answer is 72 and you wrote 36.\n\n1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:16.200\n Oh, but that's pretty close\n\n1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:18.880\n because maybe you're just off by it.\n\n1:07:18.880 --> 1:07:20.400\n By the way, they're not numerical anyway,\n\n1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:22.680\n but I'm just giving some numerical analog\n\n1:07:22.680 --> 1:07:24.560\n to the way the scoring might work.\n\n1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:25.840\n They're all essays.\n\n1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:28.240\n And that's where I guess I have some role\n\n1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:29.320\n as well as some other people\n\n1:07:29.320 --> 1:07:32.360\n who helped me in the US delegation for coaches.\n\n1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:37.360\n We actually debate with the country which is organizing it.\n\n1:07:37.560 --> 1:07:39.480\n The country which is organizing the Olympiad\n\n1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:44.480\n brings about 50 people to help judge the written solutions.\n\n1:07:45.160 --> 1:07:48.360\n And you schedule these half hour appointments\n\n1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:50.520\n where the delegation from one country\n\n1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:52.360\n sits down at a table like this.\n\n1:07:52.360 --> 1:07:55.520\n Opposite side is two or three people from the host country.\n\n1:07:55.520 --> 1:07:58.000\n And they're just looking over these exam papers\n\n1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:00.640\n saying, well, how many points is this worth\n\n1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:03.120\n based on some rubric that has been designed?\n\n1:08:03.120 --> 1:08:05.600\n And this is a negotiation process\n\n1:08:05.600 --> 1:08:07.760\n where we're not trying to bargain\n\n1:08:07.760 --> 1:08:09.320\n and get the best score we can.\n\n1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:10.880\n In fact, sometimes we go to this table\n\n1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:13.960\n and we will say, we think we want less than what you gave us.\n\n1:08:13.960 --> 1:08:16.280\n This is how our, these are our principles.\n\n1:08:16.280 --> 1:08:18.800\n If you give us too much, we say, no, you gave us too much.\n\n1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:19.720\n We do that.\n\n1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:22.280\n However, the reason why this is an interesting process\n\n1:08:22.280 --> 1:08:24.160\n is because if you can imagine every country\n\n1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:26.760\n which is participating has its own language.\n\n1:08:26.760 --> 1:08:28.760\n And so if you're trying to grade the Mongolian scripts\n\n1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:31.040\n and they're written in Mongolian,\n\n1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:33.520\n if you don't read Mongolian, which most people don't,\n\n1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:36.680\n then the coaches are explaining to you,\n\n1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:38.760\n this is what the student has written.\n\n1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:40.480\n It's actually quite interesting process.\n\n1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:43.400\n So it's almost like a jury.\n\n1:08:43.400 --> 1:08:44.240\n Yes.\n\n1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:47.120\n You have, in the American legal system,\n\n1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:49.880\n you have a jury that where they're deliberating,\n\n1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:53.640\n but unlike a jury, there's the members of the jury\n\n1:08:53.640 --> 1:08:55.800\n speaking different languages sometimes.\n\n1:08:55.800 --> 1:08:57.120\n Yes. That's fascinating.\n\n1:08:57.120 --> 1:09:01.640\n But I mean, it's hard to know what to do\n\n1:09:01.640 --> 1:09:04.560\n because it's probably really, really competitive.\n\n1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:08.560\n But your sense is that ultimately people,\n\n1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:13.560\n like how do you prevent manipulation here, right?\n\n1:09:14.240 --> 1:09:17.000\n Well, we just hope that it's not happening.\n\n1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.240\n So we write in English.\n\n1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:21.400\n Therefore, everything that the US does,\n\n1:09:21.400 --> 1:09:22.800\n everyone can look at.\n\n1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:24.120\n So it's very hard for me.\n\n1:09:24.120 --> 1:09:25.720\n It's very hard for you to manipulate.\n\n1:09:25.720 --> 1:09:27.480\n We don't manipulate.\n\n1:09:27.480 --> 1:09:29.360\n We only hope that other people aren't.\n\n1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:32.320\n But at the same time, as you see, our philosophy was,\n\n1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:35.560\n we want to use this as a way to develop general talent.\n\n1:09:35.560 --> 1:09:38.560\n And although we do this for the six people who go\n\n1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:40.640\n to the International Math Olympiad,\n\n1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:42.880\n we really want that everyone at any,\n\n1:09:42.880 --> 1:09:45.080\n touched at any stage of this process\n\n1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:48.120\n get some skills that can help to contribute more later.\n\n1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:51.520\n So I don't know if you can say something insightful\n\n1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:52.560\n to this question,\n\n1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:56.200\n but what do you think makes a really hard math problem\n\n1:09:56.200 --> 1:09:59.760\n on this Olympiad, maybe in the courses you teach\n\n1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:01.080\n or in general?\n\n1:10:01.080 --> 1:10:03.520\n What makes for a hard problem?\n\n1:10:03.520 --> 1:10:06.280\n You've seen, I'm sure, a lot of really difficult problems.\n\n1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:07.880\n What makes a hard problem?\n\n1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:12.160\n So I could quantify it by the number of leaps of insight\n\n1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:14.480\n of changes of perspective that are along the way.\n\n1:10:14.480 --> 1:10:15.800\n And here's why.\n\n1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:17.560\n This is like a very theoretical computer science\n\n1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:19.080\n way of looking at it, okay?\n\n1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:22.520\n It's that each reframing of the problem\n\n1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:23.840\n and using of some tool,\n\n1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:25.360\n I actually call that a leap of insight.\n\n1:10:25.360 --> 1:10:27.400\n When you say, oh, wow, now I see,\n\n1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:30.480\n I should kind of put these plugs into those sockets\n\n1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:33.600\n like so, and suddenly I get to use that machine.\n\n1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:34.920\n Oh, but I'm not done yet.\n\n1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:36.160\n Now I need to do it again.\n\n1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:38.960\n Each such step is a large possible,\n\n1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:41.120\n large fan out in the search space.\n\n1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:44.040\n The number of these tells you the exponent.\n\n1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:46.600\n The base of the exponent is like how big,\n\n1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:49.360\n how many different possibilities you could try.\n\n1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:51.200\n And that's actually why,\n\n1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:54.240\n like if you have a three insight problem,\n\n1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:57.560\n that is not three times as hard as a one insight problem,\n\n1:10:57.560 --> 1:10:59.080\n because after you've made the one insight,\n\n1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:03.000\n it's not clear that that was the right track necessarily.\n\n1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:03.840\n Well, unless you're very into it.\n\n1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:06.400\n There's still a branching of possibility.\n\n1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:07.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:08.080\n Right.\n\n1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:12.280\n You're saying there's problems like on the math Olympia\n\n1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:13.680\n that requires more than one insight?\n\n1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:14.520\n Yes.\n\n1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:15.360\n Those are the hard ones.\n\n1:11:15.360 --> 1:11:17.560\n And also I can tell you how you can tell.\n\n1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:19.760\n So this is how I also taught myself math\n\n1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:20.720\n when I was in college.\n\n1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:23.520\n So if you are taking a, not taught myself,\n\n1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:24.840\n I was taking classes, of course,\n\n1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:26.720\n but I was trying to read the textbook\n\n1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:29.480\n and I found out I was very bad at reading math textbooks.\n\n1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:32.760\n A math textbook has a long page of stuff that is all true,\n\n1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:34.040\n which after you read the page,\n\n1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:35.640\n you have no idea what you just read.\n\n1:11:35.640 --> 1:11:36.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:39.120\n This is just a good summary of a math textbook.\n\n1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:39.960\n Okay.\n\n1:11:39.960 --> 1:11:44.120\n Yeah, because it's not clear why anything was done that way.\n\n1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:45.400\n And yes, everything is true,\n\n1:11:45.400 --> 1:11:47.360\n but how the heck did anyone think of that?\n\n1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:50.840\n So the way that I taught myself math eventually was,\n\n1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:52.960\n the way I read a math textbook\n\n1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:55.640\n is I would look at the theorem statement.\n\n1:11:55.640 --> 1:11:58.920\n I would look at the length of the proof\n\n1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:00.000\n and then I would close the book\n\n1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:01.280\n and attempt to reproof it myself.\n\n1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:02.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:03.520\n That's brilliant.\n\n1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:05.520\n The length of the proof is telling you\n\n1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:06.800\n the number of insights,\n\n1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:08.760\n because the length of the proof is linear\n\n1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:10.640\n in the number of insights.\n\n1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:12.200\n Each insight takes space.\n\n1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:13.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:13.040 --> 1:12:14.640\n And if I know that it's a short proof,\n\n1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:16.080\n I know that there's only one insight.\n\n1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:19.000\n So when I'm doing my own way of solving the problem,\n\n1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:20.520\n like finding the proof,\n\n1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:23.080\n I quit if I have to do too many plugins.\n\n1:12:23.080 --> 1:12:24.880\n It's equivalent to a math contest.\n\n1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:25.800\n In a math contest I look,\n\n1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:27.200\n is it problem one, two, or three?\n\n1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:28.920\n That tells me how many insights there are.\n\n1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:29.960\n This is exactly what I did.\n\n1:12:29.960 --> 1:12:30.880\n That's brilliant.\n\n1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:32.080\n Linear in the number.\n\n1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:32.920\n I don't know.\n\n1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:36.320\n I think it's possible that that's true.\n\n1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:37.160\n Approximately, approximately.\n\n1:12:37.160 --> 1:12:38.480\n Approximately, yeah.\n\n1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:41.320\n I don't know if somebody out there\n\n1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:43.040\n is gonna try to formally prove this.\n\n1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:44.160\n Oh no, I mean, you're right.\n\n1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:46.040\n There are cases where maybe it's not quite linear,\n\n1:12:46.040 --> 1:12:47.040\n but in general.\n\n1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:48.360\n Well, some of it's notation too,\n\n1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:50.920\n and some of it is style and all those kinds of things,\n\n1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:51.880\n but within a textbook.\n\n1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:52.720\n Within the same book.\n\n1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:54.040\n Within the same book with the same.\n\n1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:56.160\n Within the same book on the same subject.\n\n1:12:56.160 --> 1:12:57.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:57.840\n This is what I was using.\n\n1:12:57.840 --> 1:12:58.760\n That's hilarious.\n\n1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:00.360\n Because you know, if it's a two page proof,\n\n1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:02.760\n you just know this is gonna be insane, right?\n\n1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:06.880\n That's the scary thing about insights.\n\n1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:08.200\n You look like Andrew Wiles\n\n1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:10.160\n working on the Fermat's Last Theorem,\n\n1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:13.560\n is you don't know.\n\n1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:16.200\n Something seems like a good idea,\n\n1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:17.280\n and you have that idea,\n\n1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:19.240\n and it feels like this is a leap,\n\n1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:22.280\n like a totally new way to see it,\n\n1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:25.760\n but you have no idea if it's at all useful.\n\n1:13:25.760 --> 1:13:27.000\n Even if you think it's correct,\n\n1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:30.120\n you have no idea if this is like going to go down a path\n\n1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:32.480\n that's completely counterproductive\n\n1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:34.520\n or not productive at all.\n\n1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:38.400\n That's the crappy thing about invention,\n\n1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:41.080\n is like I have, I'm sure you do.\n\n1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:44.640\n I have a lot of really good ideas every single day,\n\n1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:49.600\n but like, and I'll go inside my head along them,\n\n1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:52.040\n along that little trajectory,\n\n1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:54.640\n but it could be just a total waste.\n\n1:13:54.640 --> 1:13:57.200\n And it's, you know what that feels like?\n\n1:13:57.200 --> 1:13:59.480\n It just feels like patience is required,\n\n1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:01.800\n not to get excited at any one thing.\n\n1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:03.360\n So I think this is interesting\n\n1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:04.800\n because you raised Andrew Wiles.\n\n1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:08.400\n He spent seven years attacking the same thing, right?\n\n1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:10.360\n And so I think that what attracts\n\n1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:12.320\n professional researchers to this\n\n1:14:12.320 --> 1:14:14.880\n is because even though it's very painful\n\n1:14:14.880 --> 1:14:16.680\n that you keep fighting with something,\n\n1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:19.480\n when you finally find the right insights\n\n1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:20.680\n and string them together,\n\n1:14:20.680 --> 1:14:23.080\n it feels really good, so.\n\n1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:26.040\n Well, there's also like short term,\n\n1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:31.040\n it feels good to, whether it's real or not,\n\n1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:33.560\n to pretend like you've solved something\n\n1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:35.400\n in the sense like you have an insight\n\n1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:37.960\n and there's a sense like this might be the insight\n\n1:14:37.960 --> 1:14:39.000\n that solves it.\n\n1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:44.000\n So at least for me, I just enjoy that rush of positivity\n\n1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:46.440\n even though I know statistically speaking\n\n1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:48.520\n is probably going to be a dead end.\n\n1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:49.840\n I'm the same way, I'm the same way.\n\n1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:51.560\n In fact, that's how I know whether\n\n1:14:51.560 --> 1:14:54.320\n I might want to keep thinking about this general problem.\n\n1:14:54.320 --> 1:14:57.280\n It's like, if I still see that I'm getting some insights,\n\n1:14:57.280 --> 1:14:59.000\n I'm not at a dead end yet.\n\n1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:00.680\n But that's also where I learned something\n\n1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:01.920\n from my PhD advisor.\n\n1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:04.280\n Actually, he was a real big inspiration on my life.\n\n1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:05.760\n His name is Benny Sudakov.\n\n1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:08.120\n In fact, he grew up in the former Soviet Union.\n\n1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:12.280\n He was from Georgia, but he's an incredible person.\n\n1:15:12.280 --> 1:15:16.680\n But one thing I learned was choose the problems to work on\n\n1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:21.040\n that might matter if you succeed.\n\n1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:23.400\n Because that's why, for example, we dug into COVID.\n\n1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:25.800\n It was just, well, suppose we succeed\n\n1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:27.840\n in finding some interesting insight here.\n\n1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:29.120\n Well, it actually matters.\n\n1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:30.960\n That is worth a laugh.\n\n1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:35.960\n Yeah, and I think COVID, the way you're approaching COVID\n\n1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:38.200\n has two interesting possibilities.\n\n1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:41.680\n One, it might help with COVID or another pandemic,\n\n1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:46.680\n but two, I mean, just this whole network theory space,\n\n1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:51.200\n you might unlock some deep understanding\n\n1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:53.080\n about the interaction with human beings.\n\n1:15:53.080 --> 1:15:55.880\n That might have nothing to do with the pandemic.\n\n1:15:55.880 --> 1:15:58.360\n There's a space of possible impacts\n\n1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:00.440\n that may be direct or indirect.\n\n1:16:00.440 --> 1:16:03.280\n And the same thing is with Andrew Wiles's proof.\n\n1:16:03.280 --> 1:16:08.120\n I don't understand, but apparently the pieces of it\n\n1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:12.040\n are really impactful for mathematics,\n\n1:16:12.040 --> 1:16:14.880\n even if the main theorem is not.\n\n1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:18.240\n So along the way, the insights you have\n\n1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:22.920\n might be really powerful for unexpected reasons.\n\n1:16:22.920 --> 1:16:23.760\n So I like what you said.\n\n1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:26.840\n This is something that I learned from another friend of mine.\n\n1:16:26.840 --> 1:16:28.080\n He's a very famous researcher.\n\n1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:29.960\n All these people are more famous than I am.\n\n1:16:29.960 --> 1:16:30.960\n His name is Jacob Fox.\n\n1:16:30.960 --> 1:16:32.200\n He's Jacob Fox at Stanford.\n\n1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:33.800\n Also a very big inspiration for me.\n\n1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:36.000\n We were both grad students together at the same time.\n\n1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:36.840\n Well, most importantly,\n\n1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:38.320\n you're good at selecting good friends.\n\n1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:40.000\n Ah, yeah, well, that's the key.\n\n1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:42.040\n You gotta find good people to learn things from.\n\n1:16:42.040 --> 1:16:44.400\n But his thing was, he often said,\n\n1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:46.840\n if you solve a math problem and have this math proof,\n\n1:16:46.840 --> 1:16:48.920\n math problem for him is like a proof, right?\n\n1:16:48.920 --> 1:16:50.440\n So suppose you came up with this proof.\n\n1:16:50.440 --> 1:16:53.440\n He always asks, what have we learned from this\n\n1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:56.040\n that we could potentially use for something else?\n\n1:16:56.040 --> 1:16:58.080\n It's not just, did you solve the problem\n\n1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:00.080\n that was supposed to be famous?\n\n1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:03.360\n And is there something new in the course of solving this\n\n1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:04.600\n that you had to invent\n\n1:17:04.600 --> 1:17:06.720\n that we could now use as a tool elsewhere?\n\n1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:08.880\n Yeah, there's this funny effect\n\n1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:12.680\n where just looking at different fields\n\n1:17:12.680 --> 1:17:15.040\n where people discover parallels.\n\n1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:17.520\n They'll prove something, it'll be a totally new result.\n\n1:17:17.520 --> 1:17:19.040\n And then somebody later realizes\n\n1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:20.680\n this was already done 30 years ago\n\n1:17:20.680 --> 1:17:23.400\n in another discipline, in another way.\n\n1:17:23.400 --> 1:17:25.080\n And it's really interesting.\n\n1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:27.800\n Now, we did this offline\n\n1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:30.240\n in another illustration he showed to me.\n\n1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:33.920\n It's interesting to see the different perspectives\n\n1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:35.560\n on a problem.\n\n1:17:35.560 --> 1:17:38.760\n It kind of points like there's just like\n\n1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:42.320\n very few novel ideas that everything else,\n\n1:17:42.320 --> 1:17:45.480\n that most of us are just looking at different perspective\n\n1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:47.200\n on the same idea.\n\n1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:51.520\n And it makes you wonder this old silly question\n\n1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:53.840\n that I have to ask you is,\n\n1:17:53.840 --> 1:17:58.200\n do you think mathematics is discovered or invented?\n\n1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:02.560\n Do you think we're creating new idea?\n\n1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:06.160\n Are we building a set of knowledge\n\n1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:09.200\n that's distinct from reality?\n\n1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:12.000\n Or are we actually like,\n\n1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:13.480\n is math almost like a shovel\n\n1:18:13.480 --> 1:18:16.880\n where we're digging to like this core set of truths\n\n1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:20.000\n that were always there all along?\n\n1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:22.800\n So I personally feel like it's discovered.\n\n1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:25.360\n But that's also because I guess the way that\n\n1:18:25.360 --> 1:18:27.400\n I like to choose what questions to work on\n\n1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:31.120\n are questions that maybe we'll get to learn something about\n\n1:18:31.120 --> 1:18:32.200\n why is this hard?\n\n1:18:32.200 --> 1:18:33.880\n I mean, I'm often attracted to questions\n\n1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:36.880\n that look simple, but are hard, right?\n\n1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:38.680\n And what could you possibly learn from that?\n\n1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:40.280\n Sort of like probably the attraction\n\n1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:42.680\n of Fermat's last theorem, as you mentioned,\n\n1:18:42.680 --> 1:18:44.960\n simple statement, why is it so hard?\n\n1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:47.520\n So I'm more on the discovered side.\n\n1:18:47.520 --> 1:18:49.600\n And I also feel like if we ever ran into\n\n1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:53.120\n an intelligent other species in the universe,\n\n1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:56.960\n probably if we compared notes,\n\n1:18:56.960 --> 1:19:00.120\n there might be some similarities between both of us\n\n1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:02.280\n realizing that pi is important.\n\n1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:04.480\n Because you might say, why, why humans,\n\n1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:06.080\n do humans like circles more than others?\n\n1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:08.120\n I think stars also like circles.\n\n1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:09.880\n I think planets like circles.\n\n1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:10.920\n They're not perfect circles,\n\n1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:13.160\n but nevertheless, the concept of a circle\n\n1:19:13.160 --> 1:19:15.760\n is just point and constant distance.\n\n1:19:15.760 --> 1:19:17.400\n Doesn't get any simpler than that.\n\n1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:19.960\n It's possible that like an alien species\n\n1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:23.280\n will have, depending on different cognitive capabilities\n\n1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:25.000\n and different perception systems,\n\n1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:28.200\n will be able to see things\n\n1:19:28.200 --> 1:19:30.400\n that are much different than circles.\n\n1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:33.640\n And so if it's discovered,\n\n1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:35.840\n it will still be pointing at a lot of same\n\n1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:38.560\n geometrical concepts, mathematical concepts,\n\n1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:43.520\n but it's interesting to think of how many things\n\n1:19:43.520 --> 1:19:45.720\n we would have to still align,\n\n1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:48.520\n not just based on notation, but based on understanding,\n\n1:19:48.520 --> 1:19:53.520\n like just like some basic mathematical concepts,\n\n1:19:53.960 --> 1:19:56.880\n like how much work is there going to be\n\n1:19:56.880 --> 1:19:59.240\n in trying to find a common language?\n\n1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:02.480\n I mean, this is, I think Stephen Wolfram and his son\n\n1:20:02.480 --> 1:20:04.600\n helped with the movie Arrival,\n\n1:20:04.600 --> 1:20:07.240\n like the developing an alien language,\n\n1:20:07.240 --> 1:20:09.480\n like how would aliens communicate with humans?\n\n1:20:10.640 --> 1:20:11.800\n It's fascinating,\n\n1:20:11.800 --> 1:20:14.360\n because like math seems to be the most promising thing,\n\n1:20:14.360 --> 1:20:15.920\n but even like math,\n\n1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:20.920\n like how do you visualize mathematical ideas?\n\n1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:24.640\n It feels like there has to be an interactive component,\n\n1:20:24.640 --> 1:20:26.560\n just like we have a conversation.\n\n1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:28.440\n There has to be, this is something we don't,\n\n1:20:28.440 --> 1:20:31.440\n I think, think about often, which is like,\n\n1:20:31.440 --> 1:20:33.880\n with somebody who doesn't know anything about math,\n\n1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:35.480\n doesn't know anything about English\n\n1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:37.440\n or any other natural language,\n\n1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:40.120\n how would we describe,\n\n1:20:40.120 --> 1:20:42.400\n we talked offline about visual proofs.\n\n1:20:42.400 --> 1:20:47.400\n How would we, through visual proofs, have a conversation\n\n1:20:47.400 --> 1:20:50.160\n where we say something, here's the concept,\n\n1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:53.800\n the way we see it, does that make sense to you?\n\n1:20:53.800 --> 1:20:57.360\n And like, can you mess with that concept\n\n1:20:57.360 --> 1:20:58.760\n to make it sense for you?\n\n1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:01.400\n And then go back and forth in this kind of way.\n\n1:21:01.400 --> 1:21:03.040\n So purely through mathematics,\n\n1:21:03.040 --> 1:21:04.960\n I'm sure it's possible to have those kinds of experiments\n\n1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:07.040\n with like tribes on earth that don't,\n\n1:21:07.040 --> 1:21:08.400\n there's no common language.\n\n1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:10.840\n Through math, like draw a circle\n\n1:21:10.840 --> 1:21:13.200\n and see what they do with it, right?\n\n1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:15.640\n Do some of these visual proofs,\n\n1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:19.720\n like the summation of the odds and adds up to the squares.\n\n1:21:19.720 --> 1:21:21.960\n Yes, I wonder how difficult that is\n\n1:21:21.960 --> 1:21:24.760\n before one or the other species murders themselves.\n\n1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:27.720\n That's a good question.\n\n1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:29.760\n I hope that the curiosity for knowledge\n\n1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:31.480\n will overpower the greedy,\n\n1:21:31.480 --> 1:21:33.520\n this is back to our game theory thing,\n\n1:21:33.520 --> 1:21:37.280\n that the curiosity of like discovering math together\n\n1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:40.040\n will overpower the desire for resources\n\n1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:44.440\n and ultimately like willing to commit violence\n\n1:21:44.440 --> 1:21:46.440\n in order to gain those resources.\n\n1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:47.920\n I think as we progress,\n\n1:21:47.920 --> 1:21:50.080\n become more and more intelligent as a species,\n\n1:21:50.080 --> 1:21:53.320\n I'm hoping we would value more and more of the knowledge\n\n1:21:53.320 --> 1:21:54.880\n because we'll come up with clever ways\n\n1:21:54.880 --> 1:21:58.160\n to gain more resources so we won't be so resource starved.\n\n1:21:58.160 --> 1:21:59.000\n I don't know.\n\n1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.240\n That's a hopeful message for when we finally meet aliens.\n\n1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:02.600\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:05.720\n The cool thing about the Math Olympiad,\n\n1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:11.400\n I don't know if you know work from Francois Chollet\n\n1:22:11.400 --> 1:22:16.400\n from Google, he came up with this kind of IQ test slash,\n\n1:22:16.400 --> 1:22:18.880\n it kind of has similar aspects to it\n\n1:22:18.880 --> 1:22:23.880\n that also the Math Olympiad does for AI.\n\n1:22:24.320 --> 1:22:25.920\n So he came up with these tests\n\n1:22:25.920 --> 1:22:29.040\n where they're very simple for humans,\n\n1:22:29.040 --> 1:22:32.280\n but very difficult for AI to illustrate exactly\n\n1:22:32.280 --> 1:22:37.280\n why we're just not good at seeing a totally new problem.\n\n1:22:38.960 --> 1:22:43.960\n Sorry, AI systems are not good at looking at a new problem\n\n1:22:43.960 --> 1:22:46.680\n that requires you to detect\n\n1:22:46.680 --> 1:22:48.560\n that there's a symmetry of some kind,\n\n1:22:48.560 --> 1:22:53.560\n or there's a pattern that hasn't seen before.\n\n1:22:53.880 --> 1:22:56.680\n The pattern is like obvious to us humans,\n\n1:22:56.680 --> 1:22:59.480\n but it's not so obvious to find that kind of,\n\n1:22:59.480 --> 1:23:02.240\n you're inventing a pattern that's there\n\n1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:06.360\n in order to then find a solution.\n\n1:23:09.720 --> 1:23:12.720\n I don't know if you can comment on that.\n\n1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:16.280\n If you can comment on, but from an AI perspective\n\n1:23:16.280 --> 1:23:19.440\n and from a math problem perspective,\n\n1:23:19.440 --> 1:23:22.120\n what do you think is intelligence?\n\n1:23:22.120 --> 1:23:23.640\n What do you think is the thing\n\n1:23:23.640 --> 1:23:25.760\n that allows us to solve that problem?\n\n1:23:25.760 --> 1:23:29.560\n And how hard is it to build a machine to do that?\n\n1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:30.560\n Asking for a friend.\n\n1:23:30.560 --> 1:23:31.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:23:31.400 --> 1:23:33.000\n So I guess, you see,\n\n1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:35.920\n because if I just think of the raw search space, it's huge.\n\n1:23:35.920 --> 1:23:37.000\n That's why you can't do it.\n\n1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:38.640\n And if I think about what makes somebody\n\n1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:42.320\n good at doing these things, they have this heuristic sense.\n\n1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:44.320\n It's almost like a good chess player of saying,\n\n1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:45.960\n let's not keep analyzing down this way\n\n1:23:45.960 --> 1:23:47.600\n because there's some heuristic reason\n\n1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:49.240\n why that's a bad way to go.\n\n1:23:49.240 --> 1:23:50.520\n Where did they get that heuristic from?\n\n1:23:50.520 --> 1:23:51.760\n Now, that's a good question.\n\n1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:53.000\n I don't know.\n\n1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:56.680\n Because that, if you asked them to explain to you,\n\n1:23:56.680 --> 1:23:58.200\n they could probably say something in words\n\n1:23:58.200 --> 1:23:59.640\n that sounds like it makes sense,\n\n1:23:59.640 --> 1:24:01.240\n but I'm guessing that's only a part\n\n1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:03.000\n of what's really going on in their brain\n\n1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:04.800\n of evaluating that position.\n\n1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:05.640\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:24:05.640 --> 1:24:06.800\n If you ask Gary Kasparov, what is good,\n\n1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:10.240\n or why is this position good, he will say something,\n\n1:24:10.240 --> 1:24:12.520\n but probably not approximating everything\n\n1:24:12.520 --> 1:24:14.000\n that's going on inside.\n\n1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.920\n So there's basically a function being computed,\n\n1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:19.200\n but it's hard to articulate what that function is.\n\n1:24:19.200 --> 1:24:21.760\n Now, the question is, could a computer get as good\n\n1:24:21.760 --> 1:24:24.200\n at computing these kinds of heuristic functions?\n\n1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:25.040\n Maybe.\n\n1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:27.840\n I'm not enough of an expert to understand,\n\n1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:30.320\n but one bit of me has always been a little bit curious\n\n1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:34.200\n of whether or not the human brain has a particular tendency\n\n1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:37.480\n due to its wiring to come up with certain kinds of things,\n\n1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:39.520\n which is just natural due to the way\n\n1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:43.520\n that the topology of the neurons and whatever is there,\n\n1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:46.120\n for which if you tried to just build from scratch\n\n1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:47.280\n a computer to do it,\n\n1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:49.640\n would it naturally have different tendencies?\n\n1:24:49.640 --> 1:24:50.480\n I don't know.\n\n1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:52.280\n This is just me being completely ignorant\n\n1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:53.640\n and just saying a few ideas.\n\n1:24:53.640 --> 1:24:56.160\n Well, this is a good thing that mathematics shows\n\n1:24:56.160 --> 1:24:57.840\n is we don't have to be,\n\n1:24:57.840 --> 1:25:00.920\n so math and physics or mathematical physics\n\n1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:02.440\n operates in a world that's different\n\n1:25:02.440 --> 1:25:07.440\n than our descendants of eight brains operate in.\n\n1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:11.880\n So it allows us to have multiple, many, many dimensions.\n\n1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:15.440\n It allows us to work on weird surfaces.\n\n1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:19.920\n I would like topology as a discipline is just weird to me.\n\n1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:21.120\n It's really complicated,\n\n1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:23.560\n but it allows us to work in that space,\n\n1:25:23.560 --> 1:25:25.840\n the differential geometry and all those kinds of things\n\n1:25:25.840 --> 1:25:30.560\n where it's totally outside of our natural day to day\n\n1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:33.240\n four dimensional experience,\n\n1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:35.320\n 3D dimensional with time experience.\n\n1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:40.320\n So math gives me hope that we can discover\n\n1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:49.200\n the processes of intelligence outside the limited nature\n\n1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:51.960\n of our own human experiences.\n\n1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:54.960\n But you said that you're not an expert.\n\n1:25:55.920 --> 1:25:57.200\n It's kind of funny.\n\n1:25:57.200 --> 1:26:02.200\n I find that we know so little about intelligence\n\n1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:07.200\n that I honestly think like almost children are more expert\n\n1:26:08.760 --> 1:26:13.760\n at creating artificial intelligence systems than adults.\n\n1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:15.760\n I feel like we know so little,\n\n1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:18.200\n we really need to think outside the box.\n\n1:26:18.200 --> 1:26:19.840\n And those little,\n\n1:26:19.840 --> 1:26:22.120\n I found people should check out\n\n1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:24.640\n Francois Chollet's little exams,\n\n1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:27.080\n but even just solving math problems,\n\n1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:30.560\n I don't know if you've ever done this for yourself,\n\n1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:33.400\n but when you solve a math problem,\n\n1:26:33.400 --> 1:26:38.160\n you kind of then trace back and try to figure out\n\n1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:40.440\n where did that idea come from?\n\n1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:45.240\n Like what was I visualizing in my head?\n\n1:26:45.240 --> 1:26:47.320\n How did I start visualizing it that way?\n\n1:26:48.640 --> 1:26:52.280\n Why did I start rotating that cube in my head in that way?\n\n1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:53.120\n Like what is that?\n\n1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:55.480\n If I were to try to build a program that does that,\n\n1:26:55.480 --> 1:26:56.880\n where did that come from?\n\n1:26:56.880 --> 1:26:58.960\n So this is interesting.\n\n1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:02.680\n So I try to do this to teach middle school students\n\n1:27:02.680 --> 1:27:05.560\n how to learn how to create and think and invent.\n\n1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:06.840\n And the way I do it\n\n1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:08.920\n is there are these math competition problems\n\n1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:10.560\n and I'm working in collaboration\n\n1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:12.000\n with the people who run those.\n\n1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.040\n And I will turn on my YouTube live\n\n1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:15.080\n and for the first time,\n\n1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:17.440\n look at those questions and live solve them.\n\n1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:21.160\n The reason I do this is to let the middle school students\n\n1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:22.400\n and the high school students and the adults\n\n1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:23.440\n whoever wants to watch,\n\n1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:27.360\n just see what exactly goes on through someone's head\n\n1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:30.400\n as they go and attempt to invent what they need to do\n\n1:27:30.400 --> 1:27:32.080\n to solve the question.\n\n1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:34.520\n So I've actually thought about that.\n\n1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:37.600\n I think that, first of all, as a teacher,\n\n1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:39.920\n I think about that because whenever I want to explain\n\n1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:42.000\n to a student how to do something,\n\n1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:44.080\n I want to explain how it made sense,\n\n1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:46.160\n why it's intuitive to do the following things\n\n1:27:46.160 --> 1:27:48.720\n and why the wrong things are wrong.\n\n1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:51.840\n Not just why this one short fast way,\n\n1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:54.600\n well, why this is the right way, if that makes sense.\n\n1:27:54.600 --> 1:27:57.200\n So my point is I'm actually always thinking about that.\n\n1:27:57.200 --> 1:27:58.880\n Like how would you think about these things?\n\n1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:00.560\n And then I eventually decided the easiest way\n\n1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:04.440\n to expose this would just be to go live on YouTube\n\n1:28:04.440 --> 1:28:06.560\n and just say, I've never seen any of these questions before.\n\n1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:07.760\n Here we go.\n\n1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:12.680\n Don't you get, that's anxiety inducing for me.\n\n1:28:12.680 --> 1:28:17.240\n Don't you get trapped in a kind of like little dead ends\n\n1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:20.320\n of confusion, even on middle school problems?\n\n1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:21.960\n Yes, that's what the comments are for.\n\n1:28:21.960 --> 1:28:24.600\n The live comments come in and students say, try this.\n\n1:28:24.600 --> 1:28:25.600\n Oh wow.\n\n1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:26.640\n It's actually pretty good.\n\n1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:27.760\n And I'll never get stuck.\n\n1:28:27.760 --> 1:28:30.400\n I mean, I'm willing to go on camera and say,\n\n1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:32.160\n guess what, Potion Dough can't do this.\n\n1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:33.120\n That's fine.\n\n1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:35.760\n But then what ends up happening is you will then see\n\n1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:38.080\n how maybe somebody saying something and I look at the chat\n\n1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:40.600\n and I say, aha, that actually looks useful.\n\n1:28:40.600 --> 1:28:44.000\n Now that also shows how not all ideas,\n\n1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.880\n not all suggestions are the same power, if that makes sense.\n\n1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:48.120\n Because if I actually do get stuck,\n\n1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:52.000\n I'll go fishing through the chat, if you've got any ideas.\n\n1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:53.280\n I don't know if you can speak to this,\n\n1:28:53.280 --> 1:28:57.320\n but is there a moment for the middle school students,\n\n1:28:57.320 --> 1:28:59.640\n maybe high school as well,\n\n1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:04.360\n where there's like a turning point for them\n\n1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:07.800\n where they maybe fall in love with mathematics\n\n1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:09.720\n or they get it?\n\n1:29:09.720 --> 1:29:13.360\n Is there something to be said about like discovering\n\n1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:17.640\n that moment and trying to grab them to get them\n\n1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:20.200\n to understand that mathematics is something,\n\n1:29:20.200 --> 1:29:21.520\n no matter what they wanna do in life\n\n1:29:21.520 --> 1:29:23.040\n could be part of their life?\n\n1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:23.880\n Yes.\n\n1:29:23.880 --> 1:29:25.440\n I actually do think that the middle school\n\n1:29:25.440 --> 1:29:26.800\n is exactly the right time\n\n1:29:26.800 --> 1:29:27.880\n because that's the place\n\n1:29:27.880 --> 1:29:30.400\n where your mathematical understanding\n\n1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:32.440\n gets just sophisticated enough\n\n1:29:32.440 --> 1:29:34.640\n that you can start doing interesting things.\n\n1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:37.600\n Because if you're early on and counting,\n\n1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:40.720\n I'm honestly not very good at teaching you new insights.\n\n1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:41.880\n My wife is pretty good at that.\n\n1:29:41.880 --> 1:29:44.120\n But somehow once you get to this part\n\n1:29:44.120 --> 1:29:45.680\n where you know what a fraction is\n\n1:29:45.680 --> 1:29:49.560\n and when you know how to add and how to multiply\n\n1:29:49.560 --> 1:29:51.200\n and what the area of a triangle is,\n\n1:29:51.200 --> 1:29:54.120\n at that point to me, the whole world opens up\n\n1:29:54.120 --> 1:29:55.240\n and you can start observing\n\n1:29:55.240 --> 1:29:57.360\n there are really nifty coincidences,\n\n1:29:57.360 --> 1:29:59.840\n the things that made the Greek mathematicians\n\n1:29:59.840 --> 1:30:02.120\n and the ancient mathematicians excited.\n\n1:30:02.120 --> 1:30:03.880\n Actually back then it was exciting\n\n1:30:03.880 --> 1:30:05.680\n to discover the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n1:30:05.680 --> 1:30:06.880\n It wasn't just homework.\n\n1:30:07.840 --> 1:30:08.680\n So is there,\n\n1:30:10.280 --> 1:30:11.760\n which discipline do you think\n\n1:30:11.760 --> 1:30:14.080\n has the most exciting coincidences?\n\n1:30:14.080 --> 1:30:16.360\n So is it geometry?\n\n1:30:16.360 --> 1:30:17.920\n Is it algebra?\n\n1:30:17.920 --> 1:30:21.560\n Or is it calculus?\n\n1:30:21.560 --> 1:30:22.680\n Well, you see, you're asking me\n\n1:30:22.680 --> 1:30:24.520\n and I'm the guy who gets the most excited\n\n1:30:24.520 --> 1:30:27.320\n when the combinatorics shows up in the geometry.\n\n1:30:27.320 --> 1:30:30.040\n Is it, okay.\n\n1:30:30.040 --> 1:30:33.080\n So it's the combinatorics in the geometry.\n\n1:30:33.080 --> 1:30:35.240\n So first of all, the nice thing about geometry,\n\n1:30:35.240 --> 1:30:37.920\n this is the same nice thing about computer vision\n\n1:30:37.920 --> 1:30:39.160\n is it's visual.\n\n1:30:40.040 --> 1:30:42.720\n So geometry, you can draw circles and triangles and stuff.\n\n1:30:42.720 --> 1:30:46.720\n So it naturally presents itself\n\n1:30:46.720 --> 1:30:49.280\n to the visual proof, right?\n\n1:30:49.280 --> 1:30:51.160\n But also the nice thing about geometry,\n\n1:30:51.160 --> 1:30:56.160\n I think for me is the earliest class,\n\n1:30:56.360 --> 1:30:59.680\n the earliest discipline where there's,\n\n1:30:59.680 --> 1:31:02.600\n that's most amenable to the exploration,\n\n1:31:02.600 --> 1:31:04.960\n the invention through proofs.\n\n1:31:04.960 --> 1:31:09.640\n The idea of proofs I think is most easily shown in geometry\n\n1:31:09.640 --> 1:31:11.240\n because it's so visual, I guess.\n\n1:31:12.280 --> 1:31:14.400\n So that to me is like,\n\n1:31:14.400 --> 1:31:15.440\n if I were to think about\n\n1:31:15.440 --> 1:31:18.360\n when I first fell in love with math, it would be geometry.\n\n1:31:18.360 --> 1:31:21.280\n And sadly enough, that's not used.\n\n1:31:21.280 --> 1:31:23.240\n Geometry only has a little,\n\n1:31:23.240 --> 1:31:28.240\n appears briefly in the journey of a student.\n\n1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:30.600\n And it kind of disappears.\n\n1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:32.320\n And not until much later,\n\n1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:36.560\n which there may be like differential geometry,\n\n1:31:36.560 --> 1:31:37.720\n I don't know where else it shows up.\n\n1:31:37.720 --> 1:31:38.840\n For me in computer science,\n\n1:31:38.840 --> 1:31:40.960\n like you could start to think about\n\n1:31:40.960 --> 1:31:44.520\n like computational geometry or even graph theory\n\n1:31:44.520 --> 1:31:45.600\n as a kind of geometry.\n\n1:31:45.600 --> 1:31:47.200\n You could start to think about it visually,\n\n1:31:47.200 --> 1:31:49.320\n although it's pretty tricky.\n\n1:31:49.320 --> 1:31:51.080\n But yeah, it was always,\n\n1:31:51.080 --> 1:31:53.000\n that was the most beautiful one.\n\n1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:56.200\n Everything else, I guess calculus can be kind of visual too.\n\n1:31:56.200 --> 1:31:57.800\n That can be pretty beautiful.\n\n1:31:57.800 --> 1:32:02.800\n But is there something you try to look for in the student\n\n1:32:05.360 --> 1:32:09.920\n to see like, how can I inspire them at this moment?\n\n1:32:09.920 --> 1:32:11.960\n Or is this like individual student to student?\n\n1:32:11.960 --> 1:32:13.880\n Is there something you could say there?\n\n1:32:13.880 --> 1:32:14.720\n So first of all,\n\n1:32:14.720 --> 1:32:16.440\n I really think that every student\n\n1:32:16.440 --> 1:32:17.880\n can pick up all of this skill.\n\n1:32:17.880 --> 1:32:18.720\n I really do think so.\n\n1:32:18.720 --> 1:32:20.520\n I don't think it's something only for a few.\n\n1:32:20.520 --> 1:32:23.680\n And so if I'm looking for a student,\n\n1:32:23.680 --> 1:32:25.080\n actually oftentimes what I'm,\n\n1:32:25.080 --> 1:32:26.800\n if I'm looking at a particular student,\n\n1:32:26.800 --> 1:32:28.400\n the question is,\n\n1:32:28.400 --> 1:32:30.560\n how can we help you feel like\n\n1:32:30.560 --> 1:32:32.880\n you have the power to invent also?\n\n1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:34.200\n Because I think a lot of people\n\n1:32:34.200 --> 1:32:35.600\n are used to thinking about math\n\n1:32:35.600 --> 1:32:37.960\n as something where the teacher will show you what to do\n\n1:32:37.960 --> 1:32:39.240\n and then you will do it.\n\n1:32:39.240 --> 1:32:40.080\n Yes.\n\n1:32:40.080 --> 1:32:42.160\n So I think that the key is to show that they have some,\n\n1:32:42.160 --> 1:32:44.280\n let them see that they have some power to invent.\n\n1:32:44.280 --> 1:32:45.120\n And at that point,\n\n1:32:45.120 --> 1:32:47.640\n it's often starting by trying to give a question\n\n1:32:47.640 --> 1:32:48.720\n that they don't know how to do.\n\n1:32:48.720 --> 1:32:49.880\n You want to find these questions\n\n1:32:49.880 --> 1:32:51.160\n that they don't know how to do,\n\n1:32:51.160 --> 1:32:53.000\n that they can think about,\n\n1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:54.480\n and then they can solve.\n\n1:32:54.480 --> 1:32:55.600\n And then suddenly they say,\n\n1:32:55.600 --> 1:32:57.800\n my gosh, I've had a situation,\n\n1:32:57.800 --> 1:33:00.440\n I've had an experience where I didn't know what to do.\n\n1:33:00.440 --> 1:33:02.040\n And after a while, I did.\n\n1:33:03.320 --> 1:33:07.800\n Is there advice you can give on how to learn math\n\n1:33:08.760 --> 1:33:10.720\n for people, whether it's a middle school,\n\n1:33:10.720 --> 1:33:14.520\n whether it's somebody as an adult\n\n1:33:14.520 --> 1:33:18.080\n kind of gave up on math maybe early on?\n\n1:33:19.360 --> 1:33:22.080\n I actually think that these math competition problems,\n\n1:33:22.080 --> 1:33:23.800\n middle school and high school are really good.\n\n1:33:23.800 --> 1:33:25.080\n They're actually very hard.\n\n1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:29.160\n So if you haven't had this kind of experience before\n\n1:33:29.160 --> 1:33:32.960\n and you grab a middle school math competition problem\n\n1:33:32.960 --> 1:33:33.920\n from the state level,\n\n1:33:33.920 --> 1:33:36.320\n which is used to decide who represents the state\n\n1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:39.160\n in the country, in the United States, for example,\n\n1:33:39.160 --> 1:33:40.680\n those are pretty tricky.\n\n1:33:40.680 --> 1:33:43.560\n And even if you are a professional,\n\n1:33:43.560 --> 1:33:45.480\n maybe not doing mathematical things\n\n1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:48.280\n and you're not a middle school student, you'll struggle.\n\n1:33:48.280 --> 1:33:51.080\n So I find that these things really do teach you things\n\n1:33:51.080 --> 1:33:53.080\n by trying to work on these questions.\n\n1:33:53.080 --> 1:33:56.760\n Is there a Googleable term that you could use\n\n1:33:56.760 --> 1:33:59.440\n for the organization, for the state competitions?\n\n1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:00.280\n Ah, yeah.\n\n1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:02.280\n So there are a number of different ones\n\n1:34:02.280 --> 1:34:03.600\n that are quite popular.\n\n1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:07.760\n One of them is called Math Counts, M A T H C O U N T S.\n\n1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:08.880\n And that's a big tournament,\n\n1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:10.480\n which actually has a state level.\n\n1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:12.680\n There's also a mathleague.org,\n\n1:34:12.680 --> 1:34:15.360\n mathleague, L E A G U E dot org,\n\n1:34:15.360 --> 1:34:18.680\n also has this kind of tiered tournament structure.\n\n1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:22.600\n There's also the American math competitions, AMC 8.\n\n1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:25.920\n AMC also has AMC 10, that's for 10th grade and below\n\n1:34:25.920 --> 1:34:27.240\n and AMC 12.\n\n1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:29.240\n These are all run by the Mathematical Association\n\n1:34:29.240 --> 1:34:30.280\n of America.\n\n1:34:30.280 --> 1:34:32.880\n And these are all ways to find old questions.\n\n1:34:32.880 --> 1:34:34.840\n What about the daily challenges that you run?\n\n1:34:34.840 --> 1:34:36.000\n What are those about?\n\n1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:36.840\n We do that too.\n\n1:34:36.840 --> 1:34:39.000\n But I mean, the difference was ours isn't,\n\n1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:39.920\n that one's not free.\n\n1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:42.080\n So I should actually probably be careful.\n\n1:34:42.080 --> 1:34:44.280\n The things that I've just mentioned are also not free.\n\n1:34:44.280 --> 1:34:45.720\n Not all of those things I mentioned just now\n\n1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:46.600\n are free either.\n\n1:34:46.600 --> 1:34:48.760\n Well, people can figure out what is free and what's not,\n\n1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:51.040\n but this is really nice to know what's out there.\n\n1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:53.720\n But can you speak a little bit to the daily challenges?\n\n1:34:53.720 --> 1:34:54.560\n Sure, sure.\n\n1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:56.800\n So that's actually what we did when,\n\n1:34:56.800 --> 1:34:58.480\n I guess I was thinking about,\n\n1:34:58.480 --> 1:35:02.040\n how would I try to develop that skill in people\n\n1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:05.360\n if we had the power to architect the entire system ourselves?\n\n1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:07.440\n So that's called the daily challenge with Po Shan Luo.\n\n1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:09.720\n It's not free because that's actually how I pay\n\n1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:11.240\n for everything else I do.\n\n1:35:11.240 --> 1:35:12.840\n So that was the idea.\n\n1:35:12.840 --> 1:35:16.480\n But the concept was, aha, now let's invent from scratch.\n\n1:35:16.480 --> 1:35:17.960\n So if we're gonna go from scratch\n\n1:35:17.960 --> 1:35:19.720\n and we're gonna use technology,\n\n1:35:19.720 --> 1:35:22.040\n what if we made every single lesson\n\n1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:24.680\n something where first I say,\n\n1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:25.840\n hey, here's an interesting question.\n\n1:35:25.840 --> 1:35:27.080\n Recorded, of course, not live.\n\n1:35:27.080 --> 1:35:27.920\n But it's like, I say,\n\n1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:28.760\n hey, here's an interesting question.\n\n1:35:28.760 --> 1:35:29.880\n Why don't we think about this?\n\n1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:32.000\n But I know you don't know how to do it.\n\n1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:32.960\n So now you think,\n\n1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:35.520\n and a minute later a hint pops on the screen.\n\n1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:36.360\n But you still think.\n\n1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:38.560\n And a minute later a big hint pops on the screen.\n\n1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:39.400\n You still think.\n\n1:35:39.400 --> 1:35:41.280\n And then finally, after the three minutes,\n\n1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:43.520\n hopefully you got some ideas you tried to answer.\n\n1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:45.440\n And then suddenly there's like this\n\n1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:47.720\n pretty extended explanation of,\n\n1:35:47.720 --> 1:35:50.280\n oh yeah, so here's like multiple different ways\n\n1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:51.600\n that you can do the question.\n\n1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:54.640\n And by accident, you also just learned this other concept.\n\n1:35:54.640 --> 1:35:55.480\n That's what we did.\n\n1:35:55.480 --> 1:35:56.320\n So yeah.\n\n1:35:56.320 --> 1:35:58.160\n Is this targeted towards middle school students,\n\n1:35:58.160 --> 1:35:59.480\n high school students?\n\n1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:01.360\n It's targeted towards middle school students\n\n1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:02.400\n with competitions.\n\n1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:04.040\n But there's a lot of high school students\n\n1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:06.400\n who didn't do competitions in middle school\n\n1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:07.840\n where they would also learn how to think.\n\n1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:09.800\n If you can see the whole concept was,\n\n1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:11.720\n can we teach people how to think?\n\n1:36:11.720 --> 1:36:12.760\n How would you do that?\n\n1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:14.440\n You need to give people the chance to,\n\n1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:17.960\n on their own, invent without that kid in the front row\n\n1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:20.320\n answering every question in two seconds.\n\n1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:24.040\n And people can find it, I think, what daily.\n\n1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:26.080\n It's daily.potionlo.com.\n\n1:36:26.080 --> 1:36:27.840\n But if you go to find my website,\n\n1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:29.200\n you'll be able to find it.\n\n1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:30.600\n Beautiful.\n\n1:36:30.600 --> 1:36:32.880\n Can we zoom out a little bit in the,\n\n1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:36.240\n so day to day, week to week, month to month,\n\n1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:41.240\n year to year, what does the lifelong educational process\n\n1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:42.840\n look like, do you think?\n\n1:36:43.880 --> 1:36:46.600\n For yourself, but for me,\n\n1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:50.280\n what would you recommend in the world of mathematics\n\n1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:52.600\n or sort of as opposed to studying for a test,\n\n1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:57.600\n but just like lifelong expanding of knowledge\n\n1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:02.120\n in that skill for invention?\n\n1:37:02.120 --> 1:37:05.040\n I think I often articulate this as,\n\n1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:10.040\n can you always try to do more than you could do in the past?\n\n1:37:10.040 --> 1:37:11.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:13.640\n But that comes in many ways.\n\n1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:15.280\n And I will say it's great\n\n1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:17.680\n if one wants to build that with mathematics,\n\n1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:20.000\n but it's also great to use that philosophy\n\n1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:21.080\n with all other things.\n\n1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:23.920\n In fact, if I just think of myself, I just think,\n\n1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:26.480\n what do I know now that I didn't know a year ago\n\n1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:28.520\n or a month ago or a week ago?\n\n1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:29.400\n And not just know,\n\n1:37:29.400 --> 1:37:32.040\n but what do I have the capability of doing?\n\n1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:35.040\n And if you just have that attitude, it brings more.\n\n1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:38.280\n See, the thing is, there's also a habit,\n\n1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:43.040\n like it is a skill, like I've been using Anki,\n\n1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:46.640\n it's an app for helps you memorize things.\n\n1:37:46.640 --> 1:37:50.720\n And I've actually, a few months ago,\n\n1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:54.960\n started doing this daily of setting aside time\n\n1:37:54.960 --> 1:37:59.960\n to think about an idea that's outside of my work.\n\n1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:04.680\n Like, let's say, it's all over the place, by the way,\n\n1:38:04.680 --> 1:38:07.160\n but let's say politics, like gun control.\n\n1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:11.800\n Is it good to have a lot of guns or not in society?\n\n1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:15.000\n And just, I've set aside time every day,\n\n1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:17.640\n I do at least 10 minutes, but I try to do 30,\n\n1:38:17.640 --> 1:38:19.000\n where I think about a problem.\n\n1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:20.920\n And I kind of outline it for myself from scratch,\n\n1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:22.200\n from not looking anything up,\n\n1:38:22.200 --> 1:38:24.960\n just thinking about it, using common sense.\n\n1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:29.120\n And I think the practice of that is really important.\n\n1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:32.600\n It's the daily routine of it, it's the discipline of it.\n\n1:38:32.600 --> 1:38:35.880\n It's not just that I figured something out\n\n1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:38.800\n from thinking about gun control,\n\n1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:43.080\n it's more that that muscle is built too,\n\n1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:44.200\n it's that thinking muscle.\n\n1:38:44.200 --> 1:38:49.200\n So I'm kind of interested in, you know, math has,\n\n1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:52.080\n because especially because I've gotten specialized\n\n1:38:52.080 --> 1:38:53.040\n into machine learning,\n\n1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:55.360\n and because I love programming so much,\n\n1:38:55.360 --> 1:38:59.760\n I've lost touch with math a little bit\n\n1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:02.400\n to where I feel quite sad about it,\n\n1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:03.920\n and I want to fix that.\n\n1:39:05.040 --> 1:39:07.520\n Even just not math, like pure knowledge math,\n\n1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:10.200\n but math, like these middle school problems,\n\n1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:11.640\n the challenges, right?\n\n1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:14.680\n Is that something you see a person\n\n1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:16.160\n be able to do every single day,\n\n1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:19.600\n kind of just practice every single day for years?\n\n1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:21.520\n So I can give an answer to that,\n\n1:39:21.520 --> 1:39:23.160\n that gives a practical way you could do it,\n\n1:39:23.160 --> 1:39:24.480\n assuming you have kids.\n\n1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:26.920\n So, no, you can do it yourself.\n\n1:39:26.920 --> 1:39:28.000\n Step one, get kids.\n\n1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:29.560\n No, no, I'm just saying this\n\n1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:31.720\n because I'm just thinking out loud right now,\n\n1:39:31.720 --> 1:39:33.720\n what could I do to suggest?\n\n1:39:33.720 --> 1:39:35.960\n Because what I have noticed is that, for example,\n\n1:39:35.960 --> 1:39:37.760\n if you do have kids who are in elementary school\n\n1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:41.080\n or middle school, if you yourself go and look\n\n1:39:41.080 --> 1:39:43.080\n at those middle school math problems\n\n1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:44.480\n to think about interesting ways\n\n1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:46.160\n that you can teach your elementary school\n\n1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:48.120\n or middle school kid, it works.\n\n1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:48.960\n That's what my wife did.\n\n1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:51.040\n She never did any of those contests before,\n\n1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:53.000\n but now she knows quite a lot about them.\n\n1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:53.920\n And I didn't teach her anything.\n\n1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:55.160\n I don't do that.\n\n1:39:55.160 --> 1:39:57.320\n She just was messing around with them\n\n1:39:57.320 --> 1:39:59.600\n and taught herself all of that stuff.\n\n1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:01.400\n And that had the automatic daily.\n\n1:40:01.400 --> 1:40:03.840\n I'm always thinking, how do you make it practical, right?\n\n1:40:03.840 --> 1:40:04.880\n And the way to make it practical\n\n1:40:04.880 --> 1:40:07.680\n is if the timer on the automatically daily\n\n1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:09.520\n is that you are going to automatically daily\n\n1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:11.240\n do something with your own kid.\n\n1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:13.360\n Now it feeds back.\n\n1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:14.760\n And that includes the whole lesson\n\n1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:16.960\n that if you wanna learn something, you should teach it.\n\n1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:19.160\n Oh, I strongly believe that.\n\n1:40:19.160 --> 1:40:21.760\n I strongly believe that.\n\n1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:23.440\n So I currently don't have kids.\n\n1:40:23.440 --> 1:40:25.600\n So that's, maybe I should just get kids\n\n1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:27.040\n to help me with the math thing.\n\n1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:29.320\n But outside of that,\n\n1:40:29.320 --> 1:40:32.040\n I do want to do great math into daily practice.\n\n1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:35.920\n So I'll definitely check out the daily challenges\n\n1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:39.200\n and see, because what is it?\n\n1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:41.080\n Grant Sanderson, we talked about offline,\n\n1:40:41.080 --> 1:40:42.720\n the three blue and brown.\n\n1:40:42.720 --> 1:40:44.920\n He speaks to this as well,\n\n1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:48.200\n that his videos aren't necessarily,\n\n1:40:48.200 --> 1:40:50.520\n they don't speak to the thing that I'm referring to,\n\n1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:52.640\n which is the daily practice.\n\n1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:56.320\n They're more almost tools of inspiration.\n\n1:40:56.320 --> 1:40:58.520\n They kind of show you the beauty\n\n1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:03.520\n of a particular problem in mathematics,\n\n1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:05.760\n but they're not a daily ritual.\n\n1:41:05.760 --> 1:41:09.560\n And I'm in search of that daily ritual mathematics.\n\n1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:11.280\n It's not trivial to find,\n\n1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:16.880\n but I hope to find that\n\n1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:20.960\n because I think math gives you a perspective on the world\n\n1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:23.120\n that enriches everything else.\n\n1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:25.800\n So I like what you said about the daily also,\n\n1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:27.400\n because that's also one reason\n\n1:41:27.400 --> 1:41:29.960\n why I put my Carnegie Mellon class online.\n\n1:41:29.960 --> 1:41:30.800\n It's not every day.\n\n1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:31.960\n It's every other day.\n\n1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:33.280\n Semester is almost over.\n\n1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:35.840\n But the idea was, I guess my philosophy was,\n\n1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:37.320\n if I'm already doing the class,\n\n1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:38.880\n let's just put it there, right?\n\n1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:40.880\n But I do know that there are people\n\n1:41:40.880 --> 1:41:42.280\n who have been following it,\n\n1:41:42.280 --> 1:41:43.880\n who are not in my class at all,\n\n1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:45.920\n who have just been following it because,\n\n1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:47.560\n yes, it's combinatorics.\n\n1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:49.840\n And the value of that is you could,\n\n1:41:49.840 --> 1:41:51.800\n you don't really need to know calculus to follow it,\n\n1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:52.720\n if that makes sense.\n\n1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:54.600\n So it's actually something that people could follow.\n\n1:41:54.600 --> 1:41:56.000\n So again, and that one's free.\n\n1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.680\n So that one's just there on YouTube.\n\n1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:01.440\n Well, speaking of combinatorics,\n\n1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:03.800\n what is it, what do you find interesting,\n\n1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:07.240\n what do you find beautiful about combinatorics?\n\n1:42:07.240 --> 1:42:11.520\n So combinatorics to me is the study of things\n\n1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:16.520\n where they might be more finite and more discreet.\n\n1:42:17.240 --> 1:42:18.960\n What I mean is like, if I look at a network,\n\n1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:20.680\n actually a lot of times the combinatorics\n\n1:42:20.680 --> 1:42:21.880\n will boil down to something,\n\n1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:23.240\n and the combinatorics I think about\n\n1:42:23.240 --> 1:42:25.960\n might be something related to graphs or networks.\n\n1:42:25.960 --> 1:42:28.840\n And they're very discreet because if you have a node,\n\n1:42:28.840 --> 1:42:32.160\n it's not that you have 0.7 of a node\n\n1:42:32.160 --> 1:42:33.520\n and 0.3 of a node over there.\n\n1:42:33.520 --> 1:42:34.720\n It's that you've got one node,\n\n1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:37.440\n and then you jump one step to go to the next node.\n\n1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:39.880\n So that notion is different from say, calculus,\n\n1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:42.080\n which is very continuous,\n\n1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:44.360\n where you go and say, I have this speed,\n\n1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:46.200\n which is changing over time.\n\n1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:47.800\n And now what's the distance I've traveled?\n\n1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:49.040\n That's the notion of an integral,\n\n1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:50.920\n where you have to think of subdividing time\n\n1:42:50.920 --> 1:42:52.640\n into very, very small pieces.\n\n1:42:52.640 --> 1:42:54.400\n So the kinds of things that you do\n\n1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:59.360\n when you reason about these finite discreet structures\n\n1:42:59.360 --> 1:43:03.280\n often might be iterative, algorithmic, inductive.\n\n1:43:03.280 --> 1:43:06.320\n These are ideas where I go from one step to the next step\n\n1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:08.160\n and so on and make progress.\n\n1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:11.280\n I guess I actually personally like all kinds of math.\n\n1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:13.560\n My area of research just ended up in here\n\n1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:17.160\n because I met a really interesting PhD advisor,\n\n1:43:17.160 --> 1:43:19.000\n potential, that's honestly the reason\n\n1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:20.320\n I went into that direction.\n\n1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:22.040\n I met a really interesting guy.\n\n1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:24.880\n He seemed like he did good stuff, interesting stuff,\n\n1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:26.680\n and he looked like he cared about students.\n\n1:43:26.680 --> 1:43:29.240\n And I said, let me just go and learn whatever you do,\n\n1:43:29.240 --> 1:43:32.240\n even though my prior practice and preparation\n\n1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:34.280\n before my PhD was not combinatorics,\n\n1:43:34.280 --> 1:43:36.920\n but analysis, the continuous stuff.\n\n1:43:36.920 --> 1:43:40.600\n So the annoying thing about combinatorics\n\n1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:45.600\n and discreet stuff is it's often really difficult to solve\n\n1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:50.600\n from a sort of running time complexity perspective.\n\n1:43:53.840 --> 1:43:58.840\n Could you speak to the idea of complexity analysis\n\n1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:03.100\n of problems, do you find it useful, do you find it interesting?\n\n1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:08.240\n Do you find that lens of studying the difficulty\n\n1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:12.600\n of how difficult the computer science problem is\n\n1:44:12.600 --> 1:44:15.200\n a useful lens onto the world?\n\n1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:16.200\n Oh, very much so.\n\n1:44:16.200 --> 1:44:20.400\n Because if you want to make something practical\n\n1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:22.760\n which has large numbers of people using it,\n\n1:44:22.760 --> 1:44:27.240\n the computational complexity to me is almost question one.\n\n1:44:27.240 --> 1:44:29.080\n And that's, again, that's at the origin\n\n1:44:29.080 --> 1:44:31.760\n of when we started doing this stuff with disease control.\n\n1:44:31.760 --> 1:44:33.480\n From the very beginning, the deep questions\n\n1:44:33.480 --> 1:44:35.400\n that were running through my mind were,\n\n1:44:35.400 --> 1:44:38.480\n would we be able to support a large population\n\n1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:39.680\n with only one server?\n\n1:44:41.160 --> 1:44:43.680\n And if the answer is no, we can't start\n\n1:44:43.680 --> 1:44:45.280\n because I don't have enough money.\n\n1:44:48.200 --> 1:44:51.080\n Yeah, and there the question is very much\n\n1:44:51.080 --> 1:44:56.080\n linear time versus anything slower than linear time.\n\n1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:00.280\n As a very specific thing, you have a bunch\n\n1:45:00.280 --> 1:45:01.360\n of really interesting papers.\n\n1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:04.240\n If I could ask, maybe we could pull out some cool insights\n\n1:45:04.240 --> 1:45:05.240\n at the high level.\n\n1:45:06.160 --> 1:45:08.920\n Can you describe the data structure of a voting tree\n\n1:45:08.920 --> 1:45:11.240\n and what are some interesting results on it?\n\n1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:13.720\n You have a paper that I noticed on it.\n\n1:45:13.720 --> 1:45:17.400\n Yeah, so this is an example of, I guess,\n\n1:45:17.400 --> 1:45:20.960\n how in math we might say here's an interesting\n\n1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:24.400\n kind of a question that we just can't seem\n\n1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:25.720\n to understand enough about.\n\n1:45:25.720 --> 1:45:27.560\n Maybe there's something else going on here.\n\n1:45:27.560 --> 1:45:30.920\n And the way to describe this is you could imagine\n\n1:45:30.920 --> 1:45:33.800\n trying to hold elections where if you have\n\n1:45:33.800 --> 1:45:35.920\n only two candidates, that's kind of easy.\n\n1:45:35.920 --> 1:45:37.200\n You just run them against each other\n\n1:45:37.200 --> 1:45:38.600\n and see who gets more votes.\n\n1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:40.680\n But as you know, once you have more candidates,\n\n1:45:40.680 --> 1:45:43.120\n it's very difficult to decide who wins the election.\n\n1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:46.280\n And there's an entire voting theory around this.\n\n1:45:46.280 --> 1:45:49.400\n So a theoretical question became,\n\n1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:53.560\n what if you made like a system of runoffs,\n\n1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:57.160\n like a system of head to head contests,\n\n1:45:57.160 --> 1:45:58.600\n which is structured like a tree,\n\n1:45:58.600 --> 1:46:00.200\n almost looking like a circuit.\n\n1:46:00.200 --> 1:46:03.160\n I'm using that way of thinking because it's sort of like\n\n1:46:03.160 --> 1:46:05.680\n in electrical engineering or computer science,\n\n1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:08.120\n you might imagine having a bunch of leads\n\n1:46:08.120 --> 1:46:10.520\n that carry signal, which are going through AND gates\n\n1:46:10.520 --> 1:46:11.640\n and OR gates and whatnot.\n\n1:46:11.640 --> 1:46:13.640\n And you've managed to compute beautiful things.\n\n1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:16.280\n This is just from a purely abstract point of view.\n\n1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:18.600\n What if the inputs are candidates?\n\n1:46:18.600 --> 1:46:20.840\n And for every two candidates, it is known\n\n1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:23.480\n which of the candidates is more popular than the other.\n\n1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:25.880\n Now can you build some kind of a circuit board\n\n1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:28.000\n which says, first candidate number four\n\n1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:31.600\n will play against five and see who wins and so on.\n\n1:46:31.600 --> 1:46:34.600\n Okay, so now what would be a nice outcome, right?\n\n1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:35.840\n This is a general question of,\n\n1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:39.120\n could I make a big circuit board to feed an election into?\n\n1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:41.320\n Like maybe one nice outcome would be whoever wins\n\n1:46:41.320 --> 1:46:44.680\n at least is preferred over a lot of people.\n\n1:46:44.680 --> 1:46:45.520\n Yes.\n\n1:46:45.520 --> 1:46:48.480\n So for example, if you ran in 1,024 candidates,\n\n1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:51.080\n ideally we would like a guarantee that says\n\n1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:54.080\n that the winner beats a lot of people.\n\n1:46:54.080 --> 1:46:58.520\n Actually in any system where there are 1,024 candidates,\n\n1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:00.320\n there's always a candidate who beats\n\n1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:02.840\n at least 512 of the others.\n\n1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:04.360\n This is a mathematical fact\n\n1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:06.200\n that there's actually always a person who beats\n\n1:47:06.200 --> 1:47:09.680\n at least half of the other people.\n\n1:47:09.680 --> 1:47:13.400\n I'm trying to make sense of that mathematical fact.\n\n1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:15.000\n Is this supposed to be obvious?\n\n1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:17.000\n No, but I can explain it.\n\n1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:17.840\n No, I can't.\n\n1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:21.400\n The way it works is that, think of it this way.\n\n1:47:21.400 --> 1:47:24.280\n Every time I think, imagine I have all these candidates\n\n1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:26.040\n and everyone is competing,\n\n1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:29.200\n everyone is like compared with everyone else at some point.\n\n1:47:29.200 --> 1:47:30.600\n Well, think of it this way.\n\n1:47:30.600 --> 1:47:34.200\n Whenever there's a comparison, somebody gets a point.\n\n1:47:34.200 --> 1:47:37.000\n That's the one who is better than the other one.\n\n1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.440\n My claim is there's somebody whose score\n\n1:47:39.440 --> 1:47:42.880\n is at least half of how many other people there are.\n\n1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:44.840\n Yeah, I'm just trying to,\n\n1:47:44.840 --> 1:47:47.600\n like my intuition is very close to that being true,\n\n1:47:47.600 --> 1:47:48.680\n but it's beautiful.\n\n1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:52.240\n I didn't at first, that's not an obvious fact.\n\n1:47:52.240 --> 1:47:53.080\n No, it's not.\n\n1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:55.760\n And it feels like a beautiful fact.\n\n1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:57.120\n Well, let me explain it this way.\n\n1:47:57.120 --> 1:48:00.520\n Imagine that for every match,\n\n1:48:00.520 --> 1:48:03.840\n you didn't give one point, but you gave two points.\n\n1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:05.920\n You gave one point to each person.\n\n1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:07.040\n Now that's not what we're really doing.\n\n1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:10.840\n We really want to give one point to the winner of the match,\n\n1:48:10.840 --> 1:48:12.240\n but instead we'll just give two.\n\n1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:15.880\n If you gave two points to everyone on every matchup,\n\n1:48:15.880 --> 1:48:18.400\n actually everyone has the same number of points.\n\n1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:19.680\n And the number of points they get\n\n1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:21.440\n is how many other people there are.\n\n1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:23.560\n Does that sort of make sense?\n\n1:48:23.560 --> 1:48:24.400\n I'm just like saying.\n\n1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:26.640\n No, no, everything you're saying makes perfect sense.\n\n1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:30.720\n So the point is if for every comparison between two people,\n\n1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:32.480\n which I'm doing for every two people,\n\n1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:34.400\n I gave one point to each person,\n\n1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:36.640\n your score, everyone's score is the same.\n\n1:48:36.640 --> 1:48:38.560\n It's how many other people there are.\n\n1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:40.200\n Now we only make one change.\n\n1:48:40.200 --> 1:48:44.320\n For each matchup, you give one point only to the winner.\n\n1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:46.000\n So we're awarding half the points.\n\n1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:50.240\n So now the deal is if in the original situation,\n\n1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:52.120\n everyone's score was equal,\n\n1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:54.840\n which is how many other people there are.\n\n1:48:54.840 --> 1:48:58.480\n Now there's only half the number of points to go around.\n\n1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:01.000\n So what ends up happening is that\n\n1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:02.360\n there's always going to be,\n\n1:49:02.360 --> 1:49:04.680\n like the average number of points per person\n\n1:49:04.680 --> 1:49:07.120\n is going to be half of how many other people there are.\n\n1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:08.560\n And somebody is gonna be above average.\n\n1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:09.880\n Somebody is going to be above that.\n\n1:49:09.880 --> 1:49:10.720\n At least average.\n\n1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:13.200\n Yeah, this is this notion of expected value,\n\n1:49:13.200 --> 1:49:14.520\n that if I have a random variable,\n\n1:49:14.520 --> 1:49:16.200\n which has an expected value,\n\n1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:17.800\n there's going to be some possibility\n\n1:49:17.800 --> 1:49:19.280\n in the probability space\n\n1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:21.560\n where you're at least as big as the expected value.\n\n1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:23.680\n Yeah, when you describe it like that, it's obvious.\n\n1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:26.640\n But when you're first saying in this little circuit\n\n1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:31.040\n that there's going to be one candidate better than half,\n\n1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:33.360\n that's not obvious.\n\n1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:34.200\n Yeah, it's not obvious.\n\n1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:35.040\n It's funny.\n\n1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:35.880\n It's not obvious.\n\n1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:37.160\n Math, this is nice.\n\n1:49:37.160 --> 1:49:38.600\n Okay, so you have this,\n\n1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:42.800\n but ultimately you're trying to with a voting tree,\n\n1:49:42.800 --> 1:49:43.880\n I don't know if you're trying this,\n\n1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:48.360\n but to have a circuit that's like, that's small.\n\n1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:49.200\n Well, you'd like it to be small.\n\n1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:53.960\n That achieves the same kind of,\n\n1:49:53.960 --> 1:49:56.440\n I mean, the smaller it is,\n\n1:49:56.440 --> 1:49:59.080\n if we look at practically speaking,\n\n1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:01.560\n the lower the cost of running the election,\n\n1:50:01.560 --> 1:50:03.800\n of running through, of computing the circuit.\n\n1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:04.640\n That is true.\n\n1:50:04.640 --> 1:50:05.800\n But actually at this point,\n\n1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:08.600\n the reason the question was interesting\n\n1:50:08.600 --> 1:50:12.760\n is because there was no good guarantee\n\n1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:15.440\n that the winner of that circuit\n\n1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:18.440\n would have like have beaten a lot of people.\n\n1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:19.680\n Let me give an example.\n\n1:50:19.680 --> 1:50:20.800\n The best known circuit,\n\n1:50:20.800 --> 1:50:22.400\n when we started thinking about this,\n\n1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:24.760\n was the circuit called candidate one\n\n1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:26.400\n plays against candidate two,\n\n1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:28.640\n candidate three plays against four,\n\n1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:30.480\n and then the winners play against each other.\n\n1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:32.560\n And then by the way, five plays against six,\n\n1:50:32.560 --> 1:50:34.640\n seven against eight, the winners play against each other.\n\n1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:36.600\n You understand, it's like a giant binary tree.\n\n1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:39.400\n Yeah, it's a binary, like a balanced binary tree.\n\n1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:40.720\n It's a balanced binary tree.\n\n1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:42.680\n One, two, three, four, up to 1,024,\n\n1:50:42.680 --> 1:50:44.520\n everyone going up to find the winner.\n\n1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:45.480\n Well, you know what?\n\n1:50:45.480 --> 1:50:47.400\n There's a system in the world\n\n1:50:47.400 --> 1:50:49.720\n where it could just be\n\n1:50:49.720 --> 1:50:52.280\n that there's a candidate called number one,\n\n1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:55.240\n that just beats like 10 other people,\n\n1:50:56.200 --> 1:50:59.760\n just the 10 that they need to be on their way up\n\n1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:01.320\n and they lose to everyone else.\n\n1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:04.720\n But somehow they would get all the way up.\n\n1:51:04.720 --> 1:51:09.720\n My point is it is possible to outsmart that circuit\n\n1:51:11.040 --> 1:51:13.720\n in one weird way of the world,\n\n1:51:13.720 --> 1:51:15.320\n which makes that circuit a bad one\n\n1:51:15.320 --> 1:51:16.160\n because you want to say,\n\n1:51:16.160 --> 1:51:18.920\n I will use this circuit for all elections.\n\n1:51:18.920 --> 1:51:22.480\n And you might have a system of inputs that go in there\n\n1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:24.800\n where the winner only beat 10 other people,\n\n1:51:24.800 --> 1:51:26.720\n which is the people they had to beat on the way up.\n\n1:51:26.720 --> 1:51:29.720\n So you want to have a circuit where there's as many,\n\n1:51:29.720 --> 1:51:33.160\n like the final result is as strong as possible.\n\n1:51:33.160 --> 1:51:34.200\n Yes.\n\n1:51:34.200 --> 1:51:37.440\n And so what ideas do you have for that?\n\n1:51:37.440 --> 1:51:40.480\n So we actually only managed to improve it\n\n1:51:40.480 --> 1:51:41.800\n to square root of N.\n\n1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:43.680\n So if N is number of vertices,\n\n1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:46.080\n N over two would be the ideal.\n\n1:51:46.080 --> 1:51:48.320\n We got it to square root of N.\n\n1:51:48.320 --> 1:51:50.120\n Versus log base two.\n\n1:51:50.120 --> 1:51:51.080\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:51:51.080 --> 1:51:52.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:51:52.400 --> 1:51:53.440\n Which is...\n\n1:51:53.440 --> 1:51:54.280\n Well, that is halfway.\n\n1:51:54.280 --> 1:51:55.920\n It could be a lot.\n\n1:51:55.920 --> 1:51:56.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:51:56.760 --> 1:51:57.760\n Could be a big improvement.\n\n1:51:57.760 --> 1:51:59.000\n So that's a, okay, cool.\n\n1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:01.600\n Is there something you can say with words\n\n1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:04.600\n about what kind of circuit, what that looks like?\n\n1:52:04.600 --> 1:52:08.040\n I can give an idea of one of the tools inside,\n\n1:52:08.040 --> 1:52:10.560\n but the actual execution ends up being more complicated.\n\n1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:12.800\n But one of the widgets inside this\n\n1:52:12.800 --> 1:52:16.960\n is building a system where you have like a candidate\n\n1:52:16.960 --> 1:52:20.720\n who plays, like one part of the whole huge, huge tree\n\n1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:23.240\n is that that same candidate, let's call them seven.\n\n1:52:23.240 --> 1:52:25.520\n Seven plays against somebody,\n\n1:52:25.520 --> 1:52:26.680\n let's make up some numbers.\n\n1:52:26.680 --> 1:52:27.920\n Let's call the others like letters.\n\n1:52:27.920 --> 1:52:29.280\n So seven plays against A.\n\n1:52:30.720 --> 1:52:33.680\n Seven's also gonna play against B separately.\n\n1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:36.560\n And the winners of each of those will play each other.\n\n1:52:36.560 --> 1:52:38.440\n By the way, seven's also gonna play C.\n\n1:52:38.440 --> 1:52:39.680\n Seven's gonna play D.\n\n1:52:39.680 --> 1:52:41.040\n And the winners are gonna play each other.\n\n1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:42.520\n And the winners are gonna play each other.\n\n1:52:42.520 --> 1:52:44.960\n We call this seven against all.\n\n1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:47.720\n Well, seven against like everyone from a bunch of.\n\n1:52:47.720 --> 1:52:48.560\n Got it.\n\n1:52:48.560 --> 1:52:50.840\n So there's some nice overlap between the matchups\n\n1:52:50.840 --> 1:52:53.000\n that somehow has a nice feature to it.\n\n1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:54.200\n Yes, and I can tell you the nice feature\n\n1:52:54.200 --> 1:52:56.480\n because if at the base of this giant tree,\n\n1:52:56.480 --> 1:52:57.880\n at the base of this giant circuit,\n\n1:52:57.880 --> 1:52:58.720\n like this is a widget.\n\n1:52:58.720 --> 1:52:59.920\n We build the things out of widgets.\n\n1:52:59.920 --> 1:53:01.320\n So I'm just describing one widget.\n\n1:53:01.320 --> 1:53:03.400\n But in the base of this widget,\n\n1:53:03.400 --> 1:53:05.560\n you have lots of things which are seven against someone,\n\n1:53:05.560 --> 1:53:07.360\n seven against someone, seven against someone.\n\n1:53:07.360 --> 1:53:09.800\n In fact, every matchup at the bottom\n\n1:53:09.800 --> 1:53:11.520\n is seven against someone.\n\n1:53:11.520 --> 1:53:12.840\n What that means is\n\n1:53:12.840 --> 1:53:16.840\n if seven actually beat everyone they were matched up against,\n\n1:53:16.840 --> 1:53:18.640\n well, seven would rise to the top.\n\n1:53:18.640 --> 1:53:21.240\n So one possibility is if you see a seven\n\n1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:22.360\n emerge from the top,\n\n1:53:22.360 --> 1:53:24.280\n you know that seven actually beat everyone\n\n1:53:24.280 --> 1:53:25.600\n they were against.\n\n1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:28.360\n On the other hand, if anyone else is on top,\n\n1:53:28.360 --> 1:53:29.600\n let's call it F.\n\n1:53:29.600 --> 1:53:31.920\n If F is on top, how did F get there?\n\n1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:34.640\n Well, F beat seven on the way at the beginning.\n\n1:53:34.640 --> 1:53:37.000\n So the point is the outcome of this circuit\n\n1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:38.400\n has a certain property.\n\n1:53:38.400 --> 1:53:39.640\n If you see a seven,\n\n1:53:39.640 --> 1:53:41.680\n you know that the seven actually beat a person\n\n1:53:41.680 --> 1:53:43.960\n but the seven actually beat a bazillion people.\n\n1:53:43.960 --> 1:53:45.240\n If you see anyone else,\n\n1:53:45.240 --> 1:53:47.040\n at least you know they beat seven.\n\n1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:49.880\n Yeah, then you can prove that it has a nice property.\n\n1:53:49.880 --> 1:53:50.880\n That's really interesting.\n\n1:53:50.880 --> 1:53:54.120\n Is there something you can say,\n\n1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:55.760\n perhaps going completely outside\n\n1:53:55.760 --> 1:53:56.720\n of what we're talking about,\n\n1:53:56.720 --> 1:53:58.920\n is how we may\n\n1:54:00.720 --> 1:54:03.040\n have mathematical ideas\n\n1:54:03.040 --> 1:54:06.440\n of improving the electoral process?\n\n1:54:06.440 --> 1:54:07.320\n That one, no.\n\n1:54:07.320 --> 1:54:09.120\n No, I can't give you that one.\n\n1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:11.760\n I mean, is there, like, do you ever see it as,\n\n1:54:14.640 --> 1:54:17.400\n do you see as there being a lot of opportunities\n\n1:54:17.400 --> 1:54:19.200\n for improving how we vote?\n\n1:54:20.480 --> 1:54:23.720\n Like from your, I don't know if you saw parallels,\n\n1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:26.560\n but, you know, it seems like if,\n\n1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:29.680\n this actually kind of maps to your sort of COVID work,\n\n1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:32.240\n which is there's a network effect, right?\n\n1:54:32.240 --> 1:54:34.920\n It seems like we should be able to apply similar kind\n\n1:54:34.920 --> 1:54:39.400\n of effects of how we decide other things in our lives.\n\n1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:42.160\n And one of the big decisions we'll make\n\n1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:44.480\n is who represents us in government.\n\n1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:46.200\n Do you ever think about like mathematically\n\n1:54:46.200 --> 1:54:48.160\n about those kinds of systems?\n\n1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:49.520\n I think a little bit about those,\n\n1:54:49.520 --> 1:54:51.480\n because where I went to college,\n\n1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:53.200\n the way we voted for student government\n\n1:54:53.200 --> 1:54:56.120\n was based on this, is it called ranked choice?\n\n1:54:56.120 --> 1:54:58.600\n Where you eliminate the bottom\n\n1:54:58.600 --> 1:55:00.840\n and there was runoff elections.\n\n1:55:00.840 --> 1:55:02.840\n So that was the first time I ever saw that.\n\n1:55:02.840 --> 1:55:04.480\n And I thought that made sense.\n\n1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:06.920\n The only problem is it doesn't seem so easy\n\n1:55:06.920 --> 1:55:08.520\n to get something that makes sense adopted\n\n1:55:08.520 --> 1:55:09.760\n as the new voting system.\n\n1:55:09.760 --> 1:55:12.760\n That's a whole nother, that's not a math solution.\n\n1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:16.040\n That's a, well, it's math in the sense that it's game theory.\n\n1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:17.280\n So you have to come up with incentive,\n\n1:55:17.280 --> 1:55:18.320\n it's mechanism design.\n\n1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:21.040\n You have to figure out how to trick us\n\n1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:24.280\n despite our basic human nature\n\n1:55:24.280 --> 1:55:27.600\n to adopt solutions that are better.\n\n1:55:27.600 --> 1:55:30.520\n That's a whole nother conversation, I think.\n\n1:55:30.520 --> 1:55:33.240\n Can you just, cause it sounded really cool,\n\n1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:36.120\n talk a little bit about stochastic coalescence\n\n1:55:36.120 --> 1:55:39.400\n and you have a paper on showing that,\n\n1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:40.760\n so you could describe what it is,\n\n1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:44.760\n but I guess it's a super linear, super logarithmic time\n\n1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:46.360\n and you came up with some kind of trick\n\n1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:47.960\n that make it faster.\n\n1:55:47.960 --> 1:55:49.280\n Can you just talk about it a little bit?\n\n1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:51.680\n Yeah, so this was something which came up\n\n1:55:51.680 --> 1:55:54.160\n when I was at Microsoft Research for a summer.\n\n1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:56.680\n And I'm putting that context because that shows\n\n1:55:56.680 --> 1:55:59.560\n that it has some practical motivation at some point.\n\n1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:01.920\n Actually, I think it's still.\n\n1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:02.840\n It doesn't need to.\n\n1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:03.680\n It doesn't need to.\n\n1:56:03.680 --> 1:56:05.160\n It can be beautiful and it's all right.\n\n1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:07.360\n Yeah, so the easiest way to describe this is\n\n1:56:07.360 --> 1:56:09.920\n suppose you got like a big crowd of people\n\n1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:12.120\n and everybody knows how many hours of sleep\n\n1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:13.240\n they got last night.\n\n1:56:13.240 --> 1:56:15.240\n And you wanna know how many total hours of sleep\n\n1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:17.560\n were gotten by this big crowd of people.\n\n1:56:17.560 --> 1:56:18.760\n At the beginning, you might say,\n\n1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:20.680\n that sounds like a linear time algorithm\n\n1:56:20.680 --> 1:56:22.680\n of saying, hey, how many hours you got?\n\n1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:23.520\n How many you got?\n\n1:56:23.520 --> 1:56:24.360\n How many you got?\n\n1:56:24.360 --> 1:56:25.560\n Add, add, add.\n\n1:56:25.560 --> 1:56:26.760\n But there's a way to do this\n\n1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:28.520\n if you remember that there are people\n\n1:56:28.520 --> 1:56:30.360\n and they presumably know how to add.\n\n1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:32.160\n You could make a distributed algorithm\n\n1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:33.400\n to make this happen.\n\n1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:35.840\n For example, while we're thinking of these trees,\n\n1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:38.560\n imagine you had 1,024 people.\n\n1:56:38.560 --> 1:56:40.720\n If you could just say, hey, person number one\n\n1:56:40.720 --> 1:56:43.840\n and person number two, you will add your hours of sleep.\n\n1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:46.040\n Person number two will go away\n\n1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:48.360\n and person number one is gonna remember the sum.\n\n1:56:48.360 --> 1:56:50.920\n Person three and four add up\n\n1:56:50.920 --> 1:56:53.760\n and person three takes charge of remembering it.\n\n1:56:53.760 --> 1:56:54.840\n Person four goes away.\n\n1:56:54.840 --> 1:56:56.960\n Now this like person one knows the sum of these two.\n\n1:56:56.960 --> 1:56:58.160\n Person three knows the sum of those two.\n\n1:56:58.160 --> 1:56:59.000\n They talk.\n\n1:56:59.000 --> 1:56:59.840\n You see what I mean?\n\n1:56:59.840 --> 1:57:02.200\n You're going up this tree,\n\n1:57:02.200 --> 1:57:03.600\n same tree that we talked about earlier.\n\n1:57:03.600 --> 1:57:05.920\n Built up a tree from the bottom up.\n\n1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:07.560\n Yeah, build up a tree from the bottom up.\n\n1:57:07.560 --> 1:57:09.160\n And the beautiful thing is\n\n1:57:09.160 --> 1:57:11.360\n since everyone's doing stuff in parallel,\n\n1:57:11.360 --> 1:57:14.560\n the amount of time it takes to get the total sum\n\n1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:17.360\n is actually just the number of layers in the tree,\n\n1:57:17.360 --> 1:57:18.960\n which is 10.\n\n1:57:18.960 --> 1:57:20.360\n So now that's logarithmic time\n\n1:57:20.360 --> 1:57:23.720\n to add up the number of hours that people slept today.\n\n1:57:23.720 --> 1:57:25.240\n Sounds fantastic.\n\n1:57:25.240 --> 1:57:26.400\n There's only one problem.\n\n1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:27.960\n How do you decide who's person number one\n\n1:57:27.960 --> 1:57:29.720\n and person number two?\n\n1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:30.560\n Yes.\n\n1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:32.680\n So if, for example, you just went out into the downtown\n\n1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:34.760\n and said, hey, get these thousand people, go.\n\n1:57:34.760 --> 1:57:35.960\n Well, if you're gonna go and say,\n\n1:57:35.960 --> 1:57:37.720\n and by the way, you're one and you're two and you're three,\n\n1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:38.760\n that's linear time.\n\n1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:39.640\n Yes.\n\n1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:40.480\n That's cheating.\n\n1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:41.800\n So now the question is how to do this\n\n1:57:41.800 --> 1:57:43.000\n in a distributed way.\n\n1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:44.840\n And there were some people who proposed\n\n1:57:44.840 --> 1:57:48.880\n a very elegant algorithm and they wanted to analyze it.\n\n1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:50.680\n So I came in onto the analyze side,\n\n1:57:50.680 --> 1:57:52.800\n but the elegant algorithm was like this.\n\n1:57:52.800 --> 1:57:55.760\n It was like, well, we don't actually know\n\n1:57:55.760 --> 1:57:57.640\n what this big tree is.\n\n1:57:57.640 --> 1:57:58.880\n There isn't any big tree.\n\n1:57:58.880 --> 1:58:01.040\n So what's gonna happen is first,\n\n1:58:01.040 --> 1:58:04.280\n everyone is going to decide right now.\n\n1:58:04.280 --> 1:58:05.680\n Oh, one important thing.\n\n1:58:05.680 --> 1:58:07.000\n Everyone is going to,\n\n1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:09.960\n at the very beginning of the whole game,\n\n1:58:09.960 --> 1:58:13.400\n they will have delegated responsibility to themselves\n\n1:58:13.400 --> 1:58:16.400\n as the one who knows the sum so far.\n\n1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:18.920\n So the point is there's gonna be,\n\n1:58:18.920 --> 1:58:22.120\n people are all gonna have like a pointer which says,\n\n1:58:22.120 --> 1:58:24.440\n you are the one who knows my,\n\n1:58:24.440 --> 1:58:26.680\n you've taken care of my ticket, my number.\n\n1:58:26.680 --> 1:58:27.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:30.560\n You're the representative for this particular piece\n\n1:58:30.560 --> 1:58:31.400\n of knowledge.\n\n1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:33.680\n And at the very beginning, you're your own representative.\n\n1:58:33.680 --> 1:58:35.120\n The thing has to start simple, right?\n\n1:58:35.120 --> 1:58:36.440\n So at the beginning, you're your own representative.\n\n1:58:36.440 --> 1:58:38.040\n You're pointing to yourself, got it.\n\n1:58:38.040 --> 1:58:38.880\n Yup, yup.\n\n1:58:38.880 --> 1:58:41.560\n And now the way this works is that at every time step,\n\n1:58:41.560 --> 1:58:45.840\n someone blares a ding dong on the town clock or whatever.\n\n1:58:45.840 --> 1:58:48.680\n And each person flips a coin themselves to decide,\n\n1:58:48.680 --> 1:58:53.600\n am I going to hunt for somebody to give my number to\n\n1:58:53.600 --> 1:58:55.120\n and let them represent me?\n\n1:58:55.120 --> 1:58:58.920\n Or am I going to sit here and wait for someone to come?\n\n1:58:58.920 --> 1:58:59.960\n Okay.\n\n1:58:59.960 --> 1:59:00.800\n Okay.\n\n1:59:00.800 --> 1:59:02.600\n Well, they flipped their coin.\n\n1:59:02.600 --> 1:59:04.840\n Some of the people start asking other people saying,\n\n1:59:04.840 --> 1:59:08.560\n hey, I would like you to be my representative.\n\n1:59:08.560 --> 1:59:10.200\n Here is my number.\n\n1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:12.040\n But the problem is that there's limited bandwidth\n\n1:59:12.040 --> 1:59:13.240\n of the people who are getting asked.\n\n1:59:13.240 --> 1:59:14.440\n It's like, you can't get,\n\n1:59:14.440 --> 1:59:16.680\n you can't go out to prom with five people.\n\n1:59:16.680 --> 1:59:17.840\n But this is not what we're doing.\n\n1:59:17.840 --> 1:59:19.160\n We're adding numbers, okay?\n\n1:59:19.160 --> 1:59:20.720\n But you can only add one number.\n\n1:59:20.720 --> 1:59:22.600\n So the person who has suddenly gotten asked\n\n1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:23.920\n by all these people,\n\n1:59:23.920 --> 1:59:25.720\n well, they'll have to decide who they're going\n\n1:59:25.720 --> 1:59:27.280\n to take it from.\n\n1:59:27.280 --> 1:59:29.440\n And they randomly just choose one.\n\n1:59:29.440 --> 1:59:30.720\n When they randomly choose one,\n\n1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:31.880\n all the others are rejected\n\n1:59:31.880 --> 1:59:34.920\n and they don't get to delegate anything in that round.\n\n1:59:34.920 --> 1:59:38.360\n But now if this person has absorbed this one who said,\n\n1:59:38.360 --> 1:59:40.680\n okay, here, you take charge of my number.\n\n1:59:40.680 --> 1:59:42.600\n This person now updates their pointer.\n\n1:59:42.600 --> 1:59:44.000\n You're in charge.\n\n1:59:44.840 --> 1:59:46.640\n And this person adds the two numbers.\n\n1:59:47.680 --> 1:59:48.920\n That was the first round.\n\n1:59:50.000 --> 1:59:52.840\n In the next round, when they do the coin flipping,\n\n1:59:52.840 --> 1:59:54.280\n this person doesn't flip anymore\n\n1:59:54.280 --> 1:59:56.120\n because they're just delegating.\n\n1:59:56.120 --> 1:59:59.000\n It's that anyone who has the pointers themselves,\n\n1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:01.600\n that's like a person who is in charge\n\n2:00:01.600 --> 2:00:03.320\n of some number of informations,\n\n2:00:03.320 --> 2:00:04.680\n they flip the coin to decide,\n\n2:00:04.680 --> 2:00:08.240\n should I find other people who are agents?\n\n2:00:08.240 --> 2:00:10.040\n Or should I wait for people to ask me?\n\n2:00:10.040 --> 2:00:10.880\n Yes.\n\n2:00:10.880 --> 2:00:11.720\n Brilliant.\n\n2:00:11.720 --> 2:00:12.840\n This is somebody else's idea.\n\n2:00:12.840 --> 2:00:14.320\n And then now the idea is, okay,\n\n2:00:14.320 --> 2:00:15.720\n if you just keep doing this process,\n\n2:00:15.720 --> 2:00:16.920\n what ends up happening?\n\n2:00:16.920 --> 2:00:18.680\n Oh yeah, and also by the way,\n\n2:00:18.680 --> 2:00:20.320\n if you decide that you want to go reach out\n\n2:00:20.320 --> 2:00:23.120\n to other people, here's the catch.\n\n2:00:23.120 --> 2:00:24.680\n When you're one of these agents saying,\n\n2:00:24.680 --> 2:00:27.400\n okay, I'm going to go look for someone.\n\n2:00:27.400 --> 2:00:30.760\n You have no idea who in this crowd is an agent\n\n2:00:30.760 --> 2:00:33.400\n or somebody who delegated it to someone else.\n\n2:00:33.400 --> 2:00:35.640\n You just pick a random person.\n\n2:00:35.640 --> 2:00:37.080\n When you pick the random person,\n\n2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:38.880\n if it lands on someone and the person says,\n\n2:00:38.880 --> 2:00:41.840\n oh, I actually delegated it to someone,\n\n2:00:41.840 --> 2:00:43.240\n then you follow the point.\n\n2:00:43.240 --> 2:00:45.280\n You walk up the delegation chain.\n\n2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:46.120\n Walk up the delegation chain.\n\n2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:49.080\n And you can do like path compression in the algorithm\n\n2:00:49.080 --> 2:00:50.560\n to make it so you don't consistently\n\n2:00:50.560 --> 2:00:52.040\n do lots of walking up.\n\n2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:54.680\n But the bottom line is that what ends up happening\n\n2:00:54.680 --> 2:00:57.240\n is that you end up reaching out.\n\n2:00:57.240 --> 2:00:59.080\n Whenever you're one of the ones reaching out,\n\n2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:01.840\n you can think of it as each agent is responsible\n\n2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:03.320\n for some number of people.\n\n2:01:03.320 --> 2:01:05.480\n It's almost like they're the leader of a bunch.\n\n2:01:05.480 --> 2:01:09.920\n As the process is evolving, you have these lumps.\n\n2:01:09.920 --> 2:01:11.680\n Each lump has an agent.\n\n2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:13.360\n And when the agent reaches out,\n\n2:01:13.360 --> 2:01:15.680\n they reach out to another lump\n\n2:01:15.680 --> 2:01:18.160\n where the probability of them hitting that lump\n\n2:01:18.160 --> 2:01:20.160\n is proportional to the size of the lump.\n\n2:01:21.880 --> 2:01:25.720\n That is the one funny thing about this process.\n\n2:01:25.720 --> 2:01:27.360\n This is not that they can reach out\n\n2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:29.280\n to a uniformly random lump\n\n2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:30.920\n where every lump has the same chance\n\n2:01:30.920 --> 2:01:32.440\n of getting reached out to.\n\n2:01:32.440 --> 2:01:34.520\n The bigger the lump is,\n\n2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:38.760\n the more likely it is that you end up reaching that lump.\n\n2:01:38.760 --> 2:01:40.160\n Which is a problem?\n\n2:01:40.160 --> 2:01:41.600\n Let me explain why that's a problem.\n\n2:01:41.600 --> 2:01:43.280\n Because you see, you're hoping\n\n2:01:43.280 --> 2:01:45.400\n that this has a small number of steps,\n\n2:01:45.400 --> 2:01:47.680\n but here's a bad situation that could happen.\n\n2:01:47.680 --> 2:01:50.000\n Imagine if you had like,\n\n2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.040\n there are n people that you're adding up.\n\n2:01:52.040 --> 2:01:57.040\n Imagine that you have exactly square root of n lumps left,\n\n2:01:57.040 --> 2:02:01.440\n of which almost all of them are just one person\n\n2:02:01.440 --> 2:02:04.280\n who's still their own boss, their own manager.\n\n2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:06.080\n Except one giant one.\n\n2:02:06.080 --> 2:02:06.920\n Now what's gonna happen?\n\n2:02:06.920 --> 2:02:08.360\n It's gonna be a huge bottleneck\n\n2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:09.760\n because every round the giant one\n\n2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:11.880\n can only absorb one of the others.\n\n2:02:11.880 --> 2:02:13.560\n And now you suddenly have time\n\n2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:15.680\n which is about square root of n.\n\n2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:16.840\n The square root of n is chosen\n\n2:02:16.840 --> 2:02:20.280\n because that is one where the lumps are such\n\n2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:23.560\n that you really are limited by this large one\n\n2:02:23.560 --> 2:02:26.000\n slowly sucking up the rest of them.\n\n2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.160\n So the heart of the question became,\n\n2:02:28.160 --> 2:02:30.040\n well, but is that just so unusual\n\n2:02:30.040 --> 2:02:32.760\n that it doesn't usually happen?\n\n2:02:32.760 --> 2:02:34.680\n Because remember you start with everyone\n\n2:02:34.680 --> 2:02:36.080\n just being independent.\n\n2:02:36.080 --> 2:02:37.640\n It's like a lot of lumps of size one.\n\n2:02:37.640 --> 2:02:39.640\n How naturally do the big lumps emerge?\n\n2:02:39.640 --> 2:02:40.480\n Yes.\n\n2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:42.120\n And so what that heart of the proof was,\n\n2:02:42.120 --> 2:02:45.120\n was showing that that was a joint work with Eyal Lubezki.\n\n2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:49.040\n That one was showing that actually in that thing\n\n2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:50.920\n the lumps do kind of get out of whack.\n\n2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:54.720\n And so it's not the purely logarithmic number of steps.\n\n2:02:54.720 --> 2:02:56.720\n But if you make one very slight change,\n\n2:02:56.720 --> 2:03:00.400\n which is if you are one of the agents\n\n2:03:00.400 --> 2:03:02.400\n and you have just been propositioned,\n\n2:03:02.400 --> 2:03:05.320\n possibly relayed along by a couple of different people.\n\n2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:07.600\n If you just say, don't take a random one,\n\n2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:10.360\n but accept the smallest lump.\n\n2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:14.400\n That actually does enough to even the whole economy.\n\n2:03:14.400 --> 2:03:16.320\n Distributes the lump size.\n\n2:03:16.320 --> 2:03:17.800\n I mean, yeah, it's fascinating how\n\n2:03:17.800 --> 2:03:19.000\n with the distributed algorithms,\n\n2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:21.520\n a little adjustment can make all the difference\n\n2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:22.440\n in the world.\n\n2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:23.280\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:23.280 --> 2:03:25.320\n Actually, by the way, this does,\n\n2:03:25.320 --> 2:03:26.960\n back to our voting conversation,\n\n2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:28.480\n this makes me think of like,\n\n2:03:29.440 --> 2:03:32.240\n these networking systems are so fascinating to study.\n\n2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:35.120\n They immediately spring to mind ideas\n\n2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:37.680\n of how to have representation.\n\n2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:42.240\n Like maybe as opposed to me voting for a president,\n\n2:03:42.240 --> 2:03:45.600\n I want to vote for like,\n\n2:03:45.600 --> 2:03:48.400\n for you, Paul, to represent me,\n\n2:03:48.400 --> 2:03:50.600\n maybe on a particular issue.\n\n2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:52.560\n And then you will delegate that further.\n\n2:03:52.560 --> 2:03:55.120\n And then we naturally construct those kinds of networks\n\n2:03:55.120 --> 2:03:58.880\n because that feels like I can have a good conversation\n\n2:03:58.880 --> 2:04:00.760\n with you and figure out that you know what you're doing\n\n2:04:00.760 --> 2:04:01.800\n and I can delegate it to you.\n\n2:04:01.800 --> 2:04:05.560\n And in that way, construct a representative government,\n\n2:04:05.560 --> 2:04:08.440\n a representative decision maker.\n\n2:04:08.440 --> 2:04:12.480\n That feels really nice as opposed to like us,\n\n2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:14.600\n like a tree of height one or something,\n\n2:04:14.600 --> 2:04:16.280\n where it's like everybody's just,\n\n2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:20.440\n it feels like there's a lot of room for layers\n\n2:04:20.440 --> 2:04:23.840\n of representation to form organically from the bottom up.\n\n2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:25.400\n I wonder if there are systems like that.\n\n2:04:25.400 --> 2:04:27.080\n This is the cool thing about the internet\n\n2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:29.560\n and the digital space where we're so well connected,\n\n2:04:29.560 --> 2:04:34.080\n just like with the Novid app to distribute information\n\n2:04:34.080 --> 2:04:37.000\n about the spread of the disease.\n\n2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:39.280\n We can in the same way, in a distributed sense,\n\n2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:44.280\n form anything like any kind of knowledge bases\n\n2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:48.760\n that are formed in a decentralized way\n\n2:04:48.760 --> 2:04:51.480\n and in a hierarchical way,\n\n2:04:51.480 --> 2:04:54.320\n as opposed to sort of old way\n\n2:04:54.320 --> 2:04:56.840\n where there is no mechanism for large scale,\n\n2:04:56.840 --> 2:05:01.760\n fast distributed transactional information.\n\n2:05:01.760 --> 2:05:02.600\n This is really interesting.\n\n2:05:02.600 --> 2:05:06.800\n This is where almost like network graph theory,\n\n2:05:06.800 --> 2:05:07.920\n becomes practical.\n\n2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:11.840\n Most of that exciting work was done in the 20th century,\n\n2:05:11.840 --> 2:05:14.080\n but most of the application will be in the 21st,\n\n2:05:14.080 --> 2:05:15.960\n which is cool to think about.\n\n2:05:15.960 --> 2:05:17.720\n Let me ask the most ridiculous question.\n\n2:05:17.720 --> 2:05:19.880\n You think P equals NP?\n\n2:05:19.880 --> 2:05:21.240\n Wow.\n\n2:05:21.240 --> 2:05:22.360\n I don't know.\n\n2:05:22.360 --> 2:05:23.800\n I mean, I would say,\n\n2:05:26.640 --> 2:05:29.520\n I know there are enough people who have very strong interest\n\n2:05:29.520 --> 2:05:31.520\n in trying to show that it is.\n\n2:05:32.680 --> 2:05:34.760\n I'm talking about government agencies.\n\n2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:38.520\n For security purposes.\n\n2:05:38.520 --> 2:05:39.360\n For security purposes.\n\n2:05:39.360 --> 2:05:40.560\n And most computer scientists,\n\n2:05:40.560 --> 2:05:42.920\n we should say believe that P equals NP.\n\n2:05:43.800 --> 2:05:45.280\n My question almost like,\n\n2:05:45.280 --> 2:05:47.000\n this is back to our aliens discussion.\n\n2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:48.440\n You want to think outside the box,\n\n2:05:48.440 --> 2:05:50.960\n the low probability event,\n\n2:05:51.800 --> 2:05:53.120\n what is the world,\n\n2:05:54.040 --> 2:05:58.640\n what kind of discoveries would lead us to prove\n\n2:05:58.640 --> 2:06:01.560\n that P does not equal to NP?\n\n2:06:01.560 --> 2:06:05.480\n Like there could be giant misunderstandings\n\n2:06:05.480 --> 2:06:08.080\n or gaps in our knowledge about computer science,\n\n2:06:08.080 --> 2:06:11.040\n about theoretical computer science, about computation,\n\n2:06:11.040 --> 2:06:14.800\n which allow us to think like flatten all problems.\n\n2:06:14.800 --> 2:06:17.080\n Yeah, so I don't know the answer to this question.\n\n2:06:17.080 --> 2:06:19.440\n I think it's very interesting, but I actually,\n\n2:06:19.440 --> 2:06:21.280\n I know, let's put it this way.\n\n2:06:21.280 --> 2:06:22.520\n By being at Carnegie Mellon\n\n2:06:22.520 --> 2:06:24.880\n and being around the theoretical computer scientists,\n\n2:06:24.880 --> 2:06:27.920\n I know enough about what I don't know to say.\n\n2:06:27.920 --> 2:06:28.760\n To be humble.\n\n2:06:28.760 --> 2:06:32.320\n I'm the wrong person to answer this question.\n\n2:06:32.320 --> 2:06:33.240\n It's a great one.\n\n2:06:33.240 --> 2:06:35.920\n Well, Scott Aaronson, who's now here at UT Austin,\n\n2:06:35.920 --> 2:06:37.800\n he used to be at MIT,\n\n2:06:37.800 --> 2:06:42.800\n puts the probability of P not equals to NP at 3%.\n\n2:06:45.920 --> 2:06:48.040\n I always love it when you ask,\n\n2:06:48.040 --> 2:06:51.040\n it's very rare in science and academics\n\n2:06:51.040 --> 2:06:53.760\n because most folks are humble\n\n2:06:54.680 --> 2:06:56.800\n in the face of the mystery,\n\n2:06:56.800 --> 2:06:59.400\n the uncertainty of everything around us.\n\n2:06:59.400 --> 2:07:03.360\n To have both the humor and the guts to say like,\n\n2:07:03.360 --> 2:07:07.160\n what are the chance that there's aliens in our galaxy,\n\n2:07:07.160 --> 2:07:09.440\n intelligent alien civilizations?\n\n2:07:09.440 --> 2:07:12.280\n As opposed to saying, I don't know, it could be zero.\n\n2:07:12.280 --> 2:07:15.920\n It could be, depending on the fact, you're saying it's 2.5%.\n\n2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:20.280\n There's something very pleasant about just having,\n\n2:07:20.280 --> 2:07:22.400\n it's the number thing.\n\n2:07:24.400 --> 2:07:25.480\n It's powered to the number.\n\n2:07:25.480 --> 2:07:26.440\n It's just like 42.\n\n2:07:26.440 --> 2:07:27.280\n It's like, why 42?\n\n2:07:27.280 --> 2:07:29.640\n I don't know, but it's a powerful number.\n\n2:07:29.640 --> 2:07:30.640\n And then everything,\n\n2:07:30.640 --> 2:07:32.600\n this is the power of human psychology\n\n2:07:32.600 --> 2:07:34.760\n is once you have the number 42,\n\n2:07:36.560 --> 2:07:39.240\n it's not that the number has meaning,\n\n2:07:39.240 --> 2:07:43.960\n but because it's placed in a book with humor around it,\n\n2:07:43.960 --> 2:07:48.960\n it has the meme effect of actually creating reality.\n\n2:07:49.400 --> 2:07:53.520\n I mean, you could say that 42 has a strong contribution\n\n2:07:53.520 --> 2:07:55.920\n of helping us colonize Mars\n\n2:07:55.920 --> 2:07:57.720\n because it created,\n\n2:07:57.720 --> 2:08:00.480\n it gave the whatever existential crisis to many of us,\n\n2:08:00.480 --> 2:08:03.160\n including Elon Musk when he was young,\n\n2:08:03.160 --> 2:08:04.280\n reading a book like that.\n\n2:08:04.280 --> 2:08:07.040\n And then now 42 is now part of his humor\n\n2:08:07.040 --> 2:08:08.840\n that he doesn't shut up about,\n\n2:08:08.840 --> 2:08:09.680\n it's constantly joking about.\n\n2:08:09.680 --> 2:08:12.200\n And that humor is spreading through our minds\n\n2:08:12.200 --> 2:08:15.160\n and somehow this like silly number just had an effect.\n\n2:08:15.160 --> 2:08:19.360\n In that same way, after Scott told me like the 3% chance,\n\n2:08:19.360 --> 2:08:20.680\n it's stuck in my head.\n\n2:08:20.680 --> 2:08:22.720\n And I think it's been having a ripple effect\n\n2:08:22.720 --> 2:08:23.720\n in everybody else.\n\n2:08:23.720 --> 2:08:27.720\n The believing that P is not equal to NP,\n\n2:08:29.120 --> 2:08:32.200\n Scott almost as a joke saying it's 3%\n\n2:08:32.200 --> 2:08:34.920\n is actually motivating a large number of researchers\n\n2:08:34.920 --> 2:08:35.760\n to work on it.\n\n2:08:35.760 --> 2:08:37.080\n 3% is high.\n\n2:08:37.080 --> 2:08:37.920\n It's very high.\n\n2:08:37.920 --> 2:08:39.920\n Because for the potential impact that that would have.\n\n2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:44.280\n But then 3% is not that high because it's only,\n\n2:08:44.280 --> 2:08:46.480\n you know, like we're not very good.\n\n2:08:46.480 --> 2:08:48.840\n I feel like humans are only able to really think about\n\n2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:51.280\n like 1%, 50%.\n\n2:08:51.280 --> 2:08:55.400\n And we kind of, I think a lot of people around 3%\n\n2:08:55.400 --> 2:08:58.800\n up to 50% like in our minds.\n\n2:08:58.800 --> 2:09:00.640\n Like 3% at this point.\n\n2:09:00.640 --> 2:09:01.480\n It could happen.\n\n2:09:01.480 --> 2:09:02.480\n It could happen.\n\n2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:04.760\n And it could happen and it's like, yeah.\n\n2:09:04.760 --> 2:09:07.040\n Like half the time it'll probably happen.\n\n2:09:07.040 --> 2:09:08.200\n So we're not very good at that.\n\n2:09:08.200 --> 2:09:10.240\n That's the other thing with the pandemic\n\n2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:13.560\n is we're not the exponential growth\n\n2:09:13.560 --> 2:09:15.800\n that we also talked about offline\n\n2:09:15.800 --> 2:09:20.200\n is something that we can't quite intuit.\n\n2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:22.680\n And that's something we probably should\n\n2:09:22.680 --> 2:09:25.240\n if we're to predict the future, to anticipate the future\n\n2:09:25.240 --> 2:09:27.920\n and to understand how to create technologies\n\n2:09:27.920 --> 2:09:30.680\n that let us sort of control the future.\n\n2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:35.040\n Can I ask you for some recommendations\n\n2:09:35.040 --> 2:09:38.240\n maybe for books or movies in your life?\n\n2:09:39.120 --> 2:09:43.600\n Long ago when you were baby Po or today\n\n2:09:45.320 --> 2:09:50.160\n that you found insightful or you learned a lot from\n\n2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:52.080\n what you would recommend to others.\n\n2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:52.920\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:55.760\n So I think I don't necessarily have an exact name\n\n2:09:55.760 --> 2:09:58.600\n of these old things, but I was generally inspired\n\n2:09:58.600 --> 2:10:03.600\n by stories, true or fictional of campaigns.\n\n2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:09.080\n For example, like the Lord of the rings, that's a campaign.\n\n2:10:09.080 --> 2:10:11.400\n But the thing that always inspired me was\n\n2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:16.480\n it could be possible for somebody who's crazy enough\n\n2:10:16.480 --> 2:10:18.680\n to go up against adversity after adversity,\n\n2:10:18.680 --> 2:10:20.240\n and it succeeds.\n\n2:10:20.240 --> 2:10:23.040\n I mean, those are false, those are fictitious.\n\n2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:25.480\n But I also spent a lot of time, I guess, reading about,\n\n2:10:25.480 --> 2:10:26.600\n I don't know, I was interested somehow\n\n2:10:26.600 --> 2:10:29.520\n in like World War II history for whatever reason.\n\n2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:31.440\n That's a campaign which is much more brutal.\n\n2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:36.440\n But nevertheless, the idea of difficulty, strategy,\n\n2:10:37.560 --> 2:10:39.480\n fighting even when things,\n\n2:10:39.480 --> 2:10:40.800\n in that case it was really fighting,\n\n2:10:40.800 --> 2:10:43.600\n but just pushing on even when things are difficult.\n\n2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:46.840\n I guess these are the kinds of general stories\n\n2:10:46.840 --> 2:10:50.880\n that made me, I guess, want to work on things\n\n2:10:50.880 --> 2:10:54.920\n that would be hard and where it could be a campaign.\n\n2:10:54.920 --> 2:10:57.520\n It could be that you work on something for a year,\n\n2:10:57.520 --> 2:11:02.200\n multiple years, because that was the point, I guess.\n\n2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:04.160\n Yeah, it starts with a single person.\n\n2:11:04.160 --> 2:11:05.680\n That's the interesting thing.\n\n2:11:05.680 --> 2:11:08.880\n I've obviously been, don't shut up about it recently\n\n2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:11.400\n about World War II, especially on the Hitler side\n\n2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:12.640\n and the Stalin side.\n\n2:11:12.640 --> 2:11:15.600\n Some of that has really affected my own family.\n\n2:11:15.600 --> 2:11:18.760\n The roots of my family very much.\n\n2:11:18.760 --> 2:11:23.760\n But it's interesting to think that it was just an idea\n\n2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:26.920\n and one person decided to do stuff\n\n2:11:26.920 --> 2:11:29.520\n and it just builds and builds and builds.\n\n2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:31.840\n And you can truly have an impact on the world,\n\n2:11:31.840 --> 2:11:36.840\n both horrendous and exceptionally positive and inspiring.\n\n2:11:36.840 --> 2:11:41.840\n So yeah, it's like it's a agency of us individuals.\n\n2:11:47.840 --> 2:11:49.920\n Sometimes we think we're just reacting to the world,\n\n2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:53.080\n but we have the full power to actually change the world.\n\n2:11:53.080 --> 2:11:56.040\n Is there advice you can give to young folks?\n\n2:11:56.040 --> 2:11:58.000\n We talked, we gave a bunch of advice\n\n2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:00.600\n on middle school, high school mathematics.\n\n2:12:00.600 --> 2:12:02.480\n Is there more general advice you would give\n\n2:12:02.480 --> 2:12:04.800\n about how to succeed in life,\n\n2:12:04.800 --> 2:12:07.400\n how to learn for high school students,\n\n2:12:07.400 --> 2:12:10.600\n for college students, career or life in general?\n\n2:12:10.600 --> 2:12:12.280\n So I think the first one would be\n\n2:12:12.280 --> 2:12:14.680\n to make sure that you're learning to invent\n\n2:12:14.680 --> 2:12:19.080\n and to make sure you're not just learning how to mimic.\n\n2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:21.880\n Because a lot of times you learn how to do X\n\n2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:24.280\n by watching somebody do X and then repeating X\n\n2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:26.360\n many times with different inputs.\n\n2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:28.520\n I've just been very generic in explaining this.\n\n2:12:28.520 --> 2:12:31.840\n But I guess this is just my own attitude towards the world.\n\n2:12:31.840 --> 2:12:34.920\n I didn't like ever following anyone's directions exactly.\n\n2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:37.680\n Even if you told me this is the way to do your homework\n\n2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:39.400\n is to write in pencil, I would say,\n\n2:12:39.400 --> 2:12:42.880\n but I think pen is nice, let's try, right?\n\n2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:45.640\n So I've been that kind of a funny person.\n\n2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:50.640\n But I do encourage that if you can learn how to invent\n\n2:12:50.720 --> 2:12:52.760\n as your core skill, then you can do a lot.\n\n2:12:52.760 --> 2:12:54.320\n But then the second piece that comes with that\n\n2:12:54.320 --> 2:12:57.400\n is something I learned from my PhD advisor,\n\n2:12:57.400 --> 2:13:01.040\n which was, well, make sure that what you're working on\n\n2:13:01.040 --> 2:13:02.280\n is big enough.\n\n2:13:02.280 --> 2:13:04.760\n And so in that sense, I usually advise to people\n\n2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:06.560\n once they have learned how to invent,\n\n2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:11.520\n ideally don't just try to settle for something comfortable,\n\n2:13:11.520 --> 2:13:15.000\n try to see if you can aim for something which is hard,\n\n2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:18.000\n which might involve a campaign, which might be important,\n\n2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:20.000\n which might make a difference.\n\n2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:23.920\n And it's more of, I guess, rather than worrying\n\n2:13:23.920 --> 2:13:25.960\n what if you didn't achieve that,\n\n2:13:27.040 --> 2:13:30.320\n there's also the regret of what if I didn't try?\n\n2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:31.600\n See, that's how I operate.\n\n2:13:31.600 --> 2:13:33.720\n I don't operate based on did I succeed or fail?\n\n2:13:33.720 --> 2:13:34.640\n It was hard anyway.\n\n2:13:34.640 --> 2:13:36.640\n If I did this novid thing and the whole thing failed,\n\n2:13:36.640 --> 2:13:37.640\n would I feel terrible?\n\n2:13:37.640 --> 2:13:39.480\n No, it's a very hard problem.\n\n2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:42.640\n But would I have had the regret of not jumping in?\n\n2:13:42.640 --> 2:13:44.080\n Yes.\n\n2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:46.000\n So it's that different mentality of don't worry\n\n2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:48.680\n about the failing part as much of the,\n\n2:13:48.680 --> 2:13:50.760\n make sure you give yourself the shot\n\n2:13:50.760 --> 2:13:53.700\n at those potentially unbounded opportunities.\n\n2:13:55.160 --> 2:13:58.320\n You almost make it sound like there's a meaning to it all.\n\n2:13:58.320 --> 2:13:59.960\n Let me ask the big ridiculous question.\n\n2:13:59.960 --> 2:14:01.840\n What do you think is the meaning of life?\n\n2:14:01.840 --> 2:14:04.200\n Or maybe the easier version of that\n\n2:14:04.200 --> 2:14:06.120\n is what brings your life joy?\n\n2:14:06.120 --> 2:14:07.880\n So I'll just answer that one personally.\n\n2:14:07.880 --> 2:14:10.080\n For me, I'm a little bit weird.\n\n2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:13.520\n I sort of, I guess you can tell by now.\n\n2:14:13.520 --> 2:14:15.960\n See the pen and pencil discussion from earlier, yes.\n\n2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:16.920\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:14:16.920 --> 2:14:20.360\n So, I mean, my thing is, I guess I personally\n\n2:14:20.360 --> 2:14:24.360\n just wanted to maximize a certain score,\n\n2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:28.160\n which was for how many person years\n\n2:14:28.160 --> 2:14:31.000\n after I'm no longer here anymore,\n\n2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:33.400\n did what I do mattered?\n\n2:14:33.400 --> 2:14:34.240\n Yeah.\n\n2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:36.480\n And it didn't matter if it's necessarily attributed to me.\n\n2:14:36.480 --> 2:14:38.600\n It's just like, did it matter?\n\n2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:41.800\n And so that's what I wanted.\n\n2:14:41.800 --> 2:14:45.620\n I guess that is very inspired by how scientists work.\n\n2:14:45.620 --> 2:14:47.760\n It's like, why do we keep talking about Newton?\n\n2:14:47.760 --> 2:14:50.840\n It's because Newton discovered some interesting things.\n\n2:14:50.840 --> 2:14:52.640\n And so Newton's score is pretty high.\n\n2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:56.240\n It's going to be infinity, right?\n\n2:14:56.240 --> 2:14:59.040\n Well, let's hope it's infinity, but pretty high.\n\n2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:00.120\n Yes, yes.\n\n2:15:00.120 --> 2:15:03.780\n So you're going for, so person years,\n\n2:15:03.780 --> 2:15:05.480\n you're going for like triple digits.\n\n2:15:05.480 --> 2:15:08.940\n You're going for, so like Newton is like four digits,\n\n2:15:08.940 --> 2:15:13.400\n probably like a thousand years or personal lifetimes.\n\n2:15:13.400 --> 2:15:15.340\n How do you like to think, well, what are we?\n\n2:15:15.340 --> 2:15:17.480\n Sorry, I meant people times years.\n\n2:15:17.480 --> 2:15:18.320\n People times.\n\n2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:19.980\n So then it's like, actually his is huge.\n\n2:15:19.980 --> 2:15:23.240\n His is like going to be billions or trillions, trillions.\n\n2:15:23.240 --> 2:15:27.680\n But I guess for me, I actually changed the metric\n\n2:15:27.680 --> 2:15:28.520\n after a while.\n\n2:15:28.520 --> 2:15:30.080\n And the reason is because you may have seen,\n\n2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:33.640\n I found some simple way to solve quadratic equations\n\n2:15:33.640 --> 2:15:35.780\n that is easier than every textbook.\n\n2:15:35.780 --> 2:15:39.040\n So my score might already be not bad,\n\n2:15:39.040 --> 2:15:40.760\n which is why I decided then let's change it\n\n2:15:40.760 --> 2:15:44.640\n into the number of hours in the lifetimes as well.\n\n2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:48.480\n So the way I was doing it before is that\n\n2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:53.440\n if a person was sort of remembering or using\n\n2:15:53.440 --> 2:15:56.040\n or appreciating what I had done\n\n2:15:56.040 --> 2:16:00.280\n for like 10 years of their life.\n\n2:16:00.280 --> 2:16:01.120\n Oh, I see.\n\n2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:01.940\n That would count as 10.\n\n2:16:01.940 --> 2:16:02.780\n I see.\n\n2:16:02.780 --> 2:16:05.060\n So if there was one person who for 10 years remembered\n\n2:16:05.060 --> 2:16:06.200\n or appreciated something I did,\n\n2:16:06.200 --> 2:16:09.400\n that counts as a score of 10 and we add up overall people.\n\n2:16:09.400 --> 2:16:13.480\n And then, and that was with the hypothesis\n\n2:16:13.480 --> 2:16:16.680\n that the score would be very finite in the sense\n\n2:16:16.680 --> 2:16:19.080\n that if I didn't come up with anything\n\n2:16:19.080 --> 2:16:21.400\n that might potentially help a lot of generations\n\n2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:23.840\n in a forever way, then your score will be finite\n\n2:16:23.840 --> 2:16:25.960\n because at some point it's not,\n\n2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:28.760\n people don't remember that you made like nice bottles\n\n2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:30.160\n or something, right?\n\n2:16:30.160 --> 2:16:33.040\n But then after the quadratic equation thing,\n\n2:16:33.040 --> 2:16:34.980\n it was that there's some chance\n\n2:16:34.980 --> 2:16:37.720\n that that actually might make it into textbooks.\n\n2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:39.080\n And if it makes it in textbooks,\n\n2:16:39.080 --> 2:16:40.960\n the chance that there'll be an easier way discovered\n\n2:16:40.960 --> 2:16:42.680\n is actually quite small.\n\n2:16:42.680 --> 2:16:46.220\n So in that case, then the score might get bigger.\n\n2:16:46.220 --> 2:16:48.040\n I was just saying the score might actually already\n\n2:16:48.040 --> 2:16:51.240\n have been achieved in a non trivial way.\n\n2:16:51.240 --> 2:16:52.080\n I see.\n\n2:16:52.080 --> 2:16:53.720\n Because it's fun to think about,\n\n2:16:53.720 --> 2:16:54.620\n cause it could be different.\n\n2:16:54.620 --> 2:16:58.980\n You can achieve a high score by a small number of people\n\n2:16:58.980 --> 2:17:01.240\n using it for most of their lifetime\n\n2:17:01.240 --> 2:17:03.400\n and then generations and generations.\n\n2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:05.960\n Or you can have, if we do dissipate,\n\n2:17:05.960 --> 2:17:10.120\n if we do split colonize, become multi planetary species,\n\n2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:12.280\n you could have that little,\n\n2:17:12.280 --> 2:17:17.280\n a clever way to solve differential equations,\n\n2:17:17.280 --> 2:17:19.640\n spread through like trillions of people\n\n2:17:19.640 --> 2:17:21.600\n as they spread throughout the galaxy.\n\n2:17:21.600 --> 2:17:24.800\n And they would only use it each one,\n\n2:17:24.800 --> 2:17:26.760\n a few hours in their lifetime,\n\n2:17:26.760 --> 2:17:28.280\n but their kids will use it,\n\n2:17:28.280 --> 2:17:30.080\n the kids of kids will use it, it will spread\n\n2:17:30.080 --> 2:17:33.240\n and you'll have that impact in that kind of way.\n\n2:17:33.240 --> 2:17:34.920\n Yes, so that's why I renormalized it\n\n2:17:34.920 --> 2:17:36.440\n because I was like, well, that's kind of dumb\n\n2:17:36.440 --> 2:17:37.760\n because what's the importance of that?\n\n2:17:37.760 --> 2:17:39.880\n That'll save people 15 minutes.\n\n2:17:39.880 --> 2:17:42.380\n But, so what I meant is I didn't want to count that\n\n2:17:42.380 --> 2:17:43.320\n as the main score.\n\n2:17:46.360 --> 2:17:47.880\n Well, I'm gonna have to try to come up\n\n2:17:47.880 --> 2:17:50.360\n with some kind of device that everyone would want to use,\n\n2:17:50.360 --> 2:17:51.520\n maybe to make coffee,\n\n2:17:51.520 --> 2:17:53.880\n cause coffee seems to be the prevalent\n\n2:17:54.720 --> 2:17:57.160\n performance enhancing chemical that everyone uses.\n\n2:17:57.160 --> 2:17:59.880\n So I'll have to think about those kinds of metrics.\n\n2:17:59.880 --> 2:18:02.560\n Yeah, but you see that's just giving an idea\n\n2:18:02.560 --> 2:18:05.080\n of I guess what I found meaningful in general,\n\n2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:06.200\n like whether or not it's like,\n\n2:18:06.200 --> 2:18:08.340\n whether or not that quadratic thing is important or not.\n\n2:18:08.340 --> 2:18:10.740\n The general idea was I wanted to do things\n\n2:18:10.740 --> 2:18:12.080\n that would outlast me.\n\n2:18:12.080 --> 2:18:13.400\n And that was what inspired me\n\n2:18:13.400 --> 2:18:15.680\n and that's just how I choose what problems to work on.\n\n2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:18.520\n And that's a kind of immortality is ideas\n\n2:18:18.520 --> 2:18:23.060\n that you've invented living on long after you\n\n2:18:23.060 --> 2:18:24.920\n in the minds of others.\n\n2:18:24.920 --> 2:18:27.160\n And humans are ultimately not,\n\n2:18:27.160 --> 2:18:32.160\n are like meat vehicles that carry ideas for brief\n\n2:18:32.400 --> 2:18:34.880\n for just a few years may not be the important thing.\n\n2:18:34.880 --> 2:18:37.280\n It might be the ideas that we carry with us\n\n2:18:37.280 --> 2:18:38.680\n and invent new ones.\n\n2:18:38.680 --> 2:18:41.640\n Like we get a bunch of baby ideas in our head.\n\n2:18:41.640 --> 2:18:43.120\n We borrow them from others\n\n2:18:43.120 --> 2:18:45.060\n and then maybe we invent a new one\n\n2:18:45.060 --> 2:18:47.920\n and that new one might have a life of its own.\n\n2:18:47.920 --> 2:18:50.880\n And it's fun to think about that idea\n\n2:18:50.880 --> 2:18:53.440\n of living for many centuries to come\n\n2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:54.960\n unless we destroy ourselves.\n\n2:18:54.960 --> 2:18:56.960\n But maybe AI will borrow it\n\n2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:00.160\n and we'll remember Po as like that one human\n\n2:19:00.160 --> 2:19:04.680\n that helped us out before we of course killed him\n\n2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:06.760\n and the rest of human civilization.\n\n2:19:06.760 --> 2:19:09.840\n On that note, Po, this is a huge honor.\n\n2:19:09.840 --> 2:19:11.680\n You're one of the great educators\n\n2:19:12.880 --> 2:19:15.260\n I've ever gotten a chance to interact with.\n\n2:19:15.260 --> 2:19:18.520\n So it's truly an honor that you would talk with me today.\n\n2:19:18.520 --> 2:19:21.160\n It means especially a lot that you would travel a lot\n\n2:19:21.160 --> 2:19:22.480\n to Austin to talk to me.\n\n2:19:22.480 --> 2:19:23.480\n It really means
