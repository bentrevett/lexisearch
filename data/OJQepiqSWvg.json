  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:04.880\n The following is a conversation with Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize winner in economics,\n\n00:04.880 --> 00:10.560\n professor at CUNY, and columnist at the New York Times. His academic work centers around\n\n00:10.560 --> 00:16.880\n international economics, economic geography, liquidity traps, and currency crises. But he\n\n00:16.880 --> 00:22.400\n also is an outspoken writer and commentator on the intersection of modern day politics\n\n00:22.400 --> 00:30.080\n and economics, which places him in the middle of the tense, divisive, modern day political discourse.\n\n00:30.080 --> 00:34.560\n If you have clicked dislike on this video and started writing a comment of derision before\n\n00:34.560 --> 00:39.840\n listening to the conversation, I humbly ask that you please unsubscribe from this channel\n\n00:39.840 --> 00:44.560\n and from this podcast. Not because you're conservative, a libertarian, a liberal,\n\n00:44.560 --> 00:49.680\n a socialist, an anarchist, but because you're not open to new ideas, at least in this case,\n\n00:49.680 --> 00:54.480\n especially at its most difficult, from people with whom you largely disagree.\n\n00:55.520 --> 01:00.720\n I do my best to stay away from politics of the day because political discourse is filled\n\n01:00.720 --> 01:07.120\n with a degree of emotion and self assured certainty that to me is not conducive to exploring\n\n01:07.120 --> 01:13.440\n questions that nobody knows the definitive right answer to. The role of government,\n\n01:13.440 --> 01:19.840\n the impact of automation, the regulation of tech, the medical system, guns, war, trade,\n\n01:19.840 --> 01:26.480\n foreign policy, are not easy topics and have no clear answers, despite the certainty of the so\n\n01:26.480 --> 01:32.640\n called experts, the pundits, the trolls, the media personalities, and the conspiracy theorists.\n\n01:33.520 --> 01:40.960\n Please listen, empathize, and allow yourself to explore ideas with curiosity and without judgment\n\n01:40.960 --> 01:47.440\n and without derision. I will speak with many more economists and political thinkers, trying to stay\n\n01:47.440 --> 01:52.400\n away from the political battles of the day and instead look at the long arc of history\n\n01:52.400 --> 02:11.440\n and the lessons it reveals. In this, I appreciate your patience and support.\n\n02:30.400 --> 02:35.120\n This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n02:35.120 --> 02:40.080\n Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with\n\n02:40.080 --> 02:45.280\n fractional share trading, allowing you to buy one dollars worth of a stock no matter what the stock\n\n02:45.280 --> 02:52.320\n price is. Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing, a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.\n\n02:52.960 --> 02:59.760\n Get Cash App from the App Store and Google Play and use the code LEXPODCAST. You'll get ten dollars\n\n02:59.760 --> 03:04.960\n and Cash App will also donate ten dollars to FIRST, one of my favorite organizations that is helping\n\n03:04.960 --> 03:11.520\n to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. Since Cash App does\n\n03:11.520 --> 03:17.840\n fractional share trading, let me say that to me, it's a fascinating concept. The order execution\n\n03:17.840 --> 03:22.880\n algorithm that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction of fractional orders for the\n\n03:22.880 --> 03:29.360\n investor is an algorithmic marvel, so big props to the Cash App engineers for that. I like it when\n\n03:29.360 --> 03:34.960\n tech teams solve complicated problems to provide, in the end, a simple, effortless interface that\n\n03:34.960 --> 03:41.440\n abstracts away all the details of the underlying algorithm. And now, here's my conversation with\n\n03:41.440 --> 03:48.160\n Paul Krugman. What does a perfect world, a utopia, from an economics perspective look like?\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:56.400\n Wow, I don't really, I don't believe in perfection. I mean, somebody once once said\n\n03:56.400 --> 04:06.400\n that his ideal was slightly imaginary Sweden. I mean, I like an economy that has a really high\n\n04:06.400 --> 04:14.720\n safety net for people, good environmental regulation, and something that's kind of like\n\n04:16.080 --> 04:22.240\n some of the better run countries in the world, but with fixing all of the smaller things that\n\n04:22.240 --> 04:27.040\n are wrong with them. What about wealth distribution? Well, obviously, you know, total equality is\n\n04:28.720 --> 04:32.560\n neither possible nor, I think, especially desirable, but I think you want one where,\n\n04:33.360 --> 04:41.120\n basically one where nobody is hurting and where everybody lives in the same material universe.\n\n04:41.120 --> 04:47.040\n Everybody is basically living in the same society, so I think it's a bad thing to have\n\n04:47.040 --> 04:50.240\n people who are so wealthy that they're really not in the same world as the rest of us.\n\n04:50.240 --> 04:57.200\n What about competition? Do you see the value of competition? What may be its limits?\n\n04:57.200 --> 05:04.000\n Oh, competition is great when it can work. I mean, I remember, I'm old enough to remember\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:09.920\n when there was only one phone company and there was really limited choice, and I think the\n\n05:09.920 --> 05:17.760\n arrival of multiple phone carriers and all that has actually, you know, it's been a really good\n\n05:17.760 --> 05:25.680\n thing, and that's true across many areas, but not every industry is, not every activity is suitable\n\n05:25.680 --> 05:30.400\n for competition. So, there are some things like healthcare where competition actually\n\n05:30.400 --> 05:35.760\n doesn't work, and so it's not one size fits all.\n\n05:35.760 --> 05:41.520\n That's interesting. Why does competition not work in healthcare?\n\n05:41.520 --> 05:46.320\n Oh, there's a long list. I mean, there's a famous paper by Kenneth Arrow from 1963,\n\n05:46.320 --> 05:50.160\n which still holds up very well, where he kind of runs down the list of things you need for\n\n05:50.160 --> 05:55.680\n competition to work well. Basically, both sides to every transaction being well informed,\n\n05:56.480 --> 06:02.880\n having the ability to make intelligent decisions, understanding what's going on,\n\n06:02.880 --> 06:05.600\n and healthcare fails on every dimension.\n\n06:06.560 --> 06:08.480\n Healthcare, so not health insurance, healthcare.\n\n06:08.480 --> 06:12.240\n Well, both healthcare and health insurance, health insurance being part of it, but no,\n\n06:12.240 --> 06:18.800\n health insurance is really the idea that there's effective competition between health insurers is\n\n06:18.800 --> 06:25.280\n wrong, and healthcare, I mean, the idea that you can comparison shop for major surgery is just,\n\n06:25.280 --> 06:32.160\n you know, when people say things like that, you wonder, are you living in the same world I'm\n\n06:32.160 --> 06:33.520\n living in?\n\n06:33.520 --> 06:38.160\n You know, that piece of well informed, that was always an interesting piece for me,\n\n06:38.160 --> 06:44.880\n just observing as an outsider, because so much beautiful, such a beautiful world is\n\n06:44.880 --> 06:49.440\n possible when everybody's well informed. My question for you is, how hard is it to be\n\n06:49.440 --> 06:54.560\n well informed about anything, whether it's healthcare, or any kind of purchasing decisions,\n\n06:54.560 --> 06:56.880\n or just life in general in this world?\n\n06:57.520 --> 07:03.760\n Oh, information, you know, it varies hugely. I mean, there's more information at your\n\n07:03.760 --> 07:10.880\n fingertips than ever before in history. The trouble is, first of all, that some of that\n\n07:10.880 --> 07:18.000\n information isn't true. So it's really hard. And then some of it is just too hard to understand.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:24.960\n So if I'm buying a car, I can actually probably do a pretty good job of looking up, you know,\n\n07:24.960 --> 07:28.960\n going to consumer reports, reviews, you can get a pretty good idea of what you're getting\n\n07:28.960 --> 07:38.480\n when you get a car. If I'm going in for surgery, first of all, you know, fairly often it happens\n\n07:39.120 --> 07:44.880\n without your being able to plan it. But also, there's a, you know, medical school takes\n\n07:44.880 --> 07:49.760\n many, many years, and going on the internet for some advice is not usually a very good\n\n07:50.560 --> 07:51.060\n substitute.\n\n07:52.400 --> 07:57.440\n So speaking about news and not being able to trust certain sources of information,\n\n07:57.440 --> 08:02.800\n how much disagreement is there about, I mentioned utopia, perfection in the beginning, but how much\n\n08:02.800 --> 08:09.440\n disagreement is there about what utopia looks like? Or is most of the disagreement simply about the\n\n08:09.440 --> 08:10.400\n path to get there?\n\n08:11.760 --> 08:20.320\n Oh, I think there's two levels of disagreement. One, maybe not utopia, but justice. You know,\n\n08:20.320 --> 08:25.760\n what is a just society? And that's, there are different views. I mean, I teach my students\n\n08:25.760 --> 08:32.480\n that there are, you know, broadly speaking, two views of justice. One focuses on outcomes.\n\n08:34.880 --> 08:39.920\n You ask yourself, a just society is the one you would choose if you were trying to,\n\n08:41.520 --> 08:45.840\n the one that you would choose to live in if you didn't know who you were going to be,\n\n08:45.840 --> 08:52.320\n that's kind of John Rawls. And the other focuses on process, that a just society is one in which\n\n08:52.320 --> 09:00.320\n there is no coercion except where absolutely necessary. And there's no objective way to choose\n\n09:00.320 --> 09:06.240\n between those. I'm pretty much a Rawlsian, and I think many people are. But anyway, so there's a\n\n09:06.240 --> 09:13.280\n legitimate dispute about what we mean by a just society anyway. But then there's also a lot of\n\n09:13.280 --> 09:22.800\n a lot of dispute about what actually works. There's a range of legitimate dispute. I mean, any\n\n09:22.800 --> 09:28.560\n card carrying economist will say that incentives matter, but how much do they matter? How much does\n\n09:28.560 --> 09:34.720\n a higher tax rate actually deter people from working? How much does a stronger safety net\n\n09:34.720 --> 09:46.000\n actually lead people to get lazy? I have a pretty strong view that the evidence points to conclusions\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:53.280\n that are considerably to the left of where most of our politicians are. But there is legitimate\n\n09:53.280 --> 10:01.440\n room for disagreement on those things. So you've mentioned outcomes. What are some metrics you\n\n10:01.440 --> 10:06.400\n think about that you keep in mind, like the Gini coefficient, but really anything that measures\n\n10:07.200 --> 10:12.000\n how good we're doing, whatever we're trying to do? What are the metrics you keep an eye on?\n\n10:12.560 --> 10:17.840\n Well, I'm actually I'm not a fan of the Gini coefficient, not because what is the Gini\n\n10:17.840 --> 10:23.600\n coefficient? Yeah, the Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality, and it is commonly used\n\n10:23.600 --> 10:29.600\n because it's a single number. It usually tracks with other measures, but the trouble is there's\n\n10:29.600 --> 10:40.400\n no sort of natural interpretation of it. If you ask me what does a society with a Gini of 0.45\n\n10:40.400 --> 10:46.720\n look like as opposed to a society with a Gini of 0.25? And I can kind of tell you, you know,\n\n10:46.720 --> 10:56.000\n when 0.25 is Denmark and 0.45 is Brazil, but there's no sort of easy way to do that mapping.\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:03.120\n I mean, I look at things like what is, first of all, things like what is the income of the\n\n11:04.880 --> 11:12.160\n median family? What is the income of the top 1%? How many people are in poverty by\n\n11:12.720 --> 11:18.720\n various measures of poverty? And then I think you want to look at questions like\n\n11:18.720 --> 11:30.080\n how healthy are people? How is life expectancy doing? And how satisfied are people with their\n\n11:30.080 --> 11:35.200\n lives? Because there is that sounds like a squishy number, not so much happiness. It\n\n11:35.200 --> 11:40.160\n turns out that life satisfaction is a better measure than happiness. But life satisfaction,\n\n11:40.160 --> 11:49.120\n that varies quite a lot. And I think it's meaningful, if not too rigorous to say, look,\n\n11:49.120 --> 11:55.600\n according to polling, people in Denmark are pretty satisfied with their lives and\n\n11:56.560 --> 12:01.840\n people in the United States, not so much so. And of course, Sweden wins every time.\n\n12:01.840 --> 12:06.720\n No, actually Denmark wins these days. Denmark and Norway tend to win these days. Sweden doesn't do\n\n12:06.720 --> 12:18.000\n badly. None of these are perfect. But look, I think by and large, there's a bit of a\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:23.520\n pornography test. How do you know a decent society? Well, you kind of know it when you see it.\n\n12:23.520 --> 12:26.160\n Right. Where does America stand on that?\n\n12:26.160 --> 12:35.120\n We have a remarkable... There are a lot of virtues to America, but there's a level of harshness,\n\n12:35.120 --> 12:44.000\n brutality, an ability for somebody who just has bad luck to fall off the edge, that is really,\n\n12:46.320 --> 12:51.440\n shouldn't be happening in a country as rich as ours. So we have somehow managed to produce a\n\n12:52.560 --> 12:58.960\n a crueller society than almost any other wealthy country for no good reason.\n\n12:59.760 --> 13:04.080\n What do you think is lacking in the safety net that the United States provides? You said\n\n13:04.080 --> 13:11.600\n there's a harshness to it. And what are the benefits and maybe limits of a safety net\n\n13:11.600 --> 13:16.320\n in a country like ours? Well, every other advanced country has some\n\n13:16.320 --> 13:20.960\n universal guarantee of adequate healthcare. The United States is the only place where\n\n13:21.680 --> 13:27.440\n citizens can actually fail to get basic healthcare because they can't afford it.\n\n13:27.440 --> 13:34.400\n It's not hard to do. Everybody else does it, but we don't. We've gotten a little bit better at it\n\n13:34.400 --> 13:44.640\n than we were, but still, that's a big deal. We have remarkably weak support for children.\n\n13:45.680 --> 13:53.280\n Most countries have substantial safety... Parents of young children get much more support elsewhere.\n\n13:53.280 --> 14:04.080\n They get often nothing in the US. We have limited care for people. Long term care for the elderly\n\n14:04.720 --> 14:14.400\n is a very hit and miss thing. But I think that the really big issues are that we don't take care of\n\n14:14.400 --> 14:20.000\n children who make the mistake of having the wrong parents, and we don't take care of people who make\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:25.600\n the mistake of getting sick. And those are things that a rich country should be doing.\n\n14:26.320 --> 14:32.240\n Sorry for sort of a difficult question, but what you just said kind of feels like the right thing\n\n14:32.240 --> 14:40.160\n to do in terms of a just society. But is it also good for the economic health of society to take\n\n14:40.160 --> 14:44.880\n care of the people who are the unfortunate members of society?\n\n14:44.880 --> 14:52.000\n By and large, it looks like doing the right thing in terms of justice is also the right thing in\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:58.960\n terms of economics. If we're talking about a society that has extremely high tax rates that\n\n14:58.960 --> 15:07.680\n deter, remove all incentives to provide a safety net that is so generous that why bother working\n\n15:07.680 --> 15:13.440\n or striving, that could be a problem. But I don't actually know any society that looks like that.\n\n15:13.440 --> 15:20.960\n Even in European countries with very generous safety nets, people work and innovate and do all\n\n15:20.960 --> 15:28.480\n of these things. And there's a lot of evidence now that lacking those basics is actually destructive,\n\n15:28.480 --> 15:32.960\n that children who grow up without adequate health care, without adequate nutrition,\n\n15:34.640 --> 15:40.240\n are developmentally challenged. They don't live up to their potential as adults. So the United\n\n15:40.240 --> 15:46.960\n States actually probably pays a price. We're harsh, we're cruel, and we actually make ourselves poorer\n\n15:46.960 --> 15:51.520\n as a society, not just the individuals, by being so harsh and cruel.\n\n15:52.400 --> 15:59.120\n Okay, so Invisible Hand, Smith, where does that fit in? The power of just people acting selfishly\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:06.960\n and somehow everything taking care of itself to where the economy grows,\n\n16:06.960 --> 16:14.640\n nobody, there's no cruelty, no injustice, that the markets regulate themselves. Is there power\n\n16:14.640 --> 16:21.520\n to that idea and what are its limits? There's a lot of power to that. I mean, there's a reason why\n\n16:23.120 --> 16:29.360\n I don't think sensible people want the government running steel mills or they want the government\n\n16:29.360 --> 16:40.960\n to own the farms, right? The markets are a pretty effective way of getting incentives aligned,\n\n16:40.960 --> 16:46.720\n of inducing people to do stuff that works. And the Invisible Hand is saying that farmers aren't\n\n16:46.720 --> 16:51.120\n growing crops because they want to feed people, they're growing crops because they can make money\n\n16:51.120 --> 16:56.960\n by it, but it actually turns out to be a pretty good way of getting an agrarian\n\n16:56.960 --> 17:04.560\n of getting agricultural products grown. So the Invisible Hand is an important part,\n\n17:04.560 --> 17:10.400\n but there's nothing mystical about it. It's a mechanism, it's a way to organize economic\n\n17:10.400 --> 17:15.840\n activity, which works well given a bunch of preconditions, which means that it actually\n\n17:15.840 --> 17:22.880\n works well for agriculture, it works well for manufacturing, it works well for many services,\n\n17:22.880 --> 17:30.400\n it doesn't work well for healthcare, it doesn't work well for education. So having a society\n\n17:30.400 --> 17:39.200\n which is kind of three quarters Invisible Hand and one quarter Visible Hand, something on that\n\n17:39.200 --> 17:47.920\n order seems to be the balance that works best. You don't want to romanticize or make something\n\n17:47.920 --> 17:54.880\n mystical out of it. This is one way to organize stuff that happens to have broad but not universal\n\n17:54.880 --> 18:02.800\n application. So then forgive me for romanticizing it, but it does seem pretty magical. I kind of\n\n18:02.800 --> 18:06.880\n have an intuitive understanding of what happens when you have like five, ten, maybe even a hundred\n\n18:06.880 --> 18:12.640\n people together, the dynamics of that. But the fact that these large society of people for the\n\n18:12.640 --> 18:17.440\n most part acting in a self interested way and maybe electing representatives for themselves,\n\n18:17.440 --> 18:28.480\n that it all kind of seems to work, it's pretty magical. The fact that right now there's a wide\n\n18:28.480 --> 18:39.200\n assortment of fresh fruit and vegetables in the local markets up and down the street, who's\n\n18:39.200 --> 18:43.920\n planning that? And the answer is nobody. That's the Invisible Hand at work and that's great.\n\n18:43.920 --> 18:55.360\n And that's a lesson that Adam Smith figured out more than 200 years ago and it continues to apply.\n\n18:56.160 --> 19:01.600\n But even Adam Smith has a section in his book about why it's important to regulate banks.\n\n19:02.480 --> 19:07.680\n So the Invisible Hand has its limits. And that example is actually a powerful one in terms of\n\n19:07.680 --> 19:13.280\n the supermarket and fruit. That was my experience coming from Russia from the Soviet Union is when\n\n19:13.280 --> 19:20.000\n I first entered a supermarket and just seeing the assortment of fruit, bananas. I don't think I've\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:25.600\n seen bananas before, first of all, but just the selection of fresh fruit was just mind blowing.\n\n19:27.120 --> 19:32.480\n Beyond words and the fact that, like you said, I don't know what made that happen.\n\n19:32.480 --> 19:40.400\n Well, there is some magic to the market. As showing my age, but the old movie quote,\n\n19:40.400 --> 19:43.520\n sometimes the magic works and sometimes it doesn't. And you have to have some idea of when\n\n19:43.520 --> 19:51.120\n it doesn't. So how do you get regulation? What can government at its best do? Government,\n\n19:52.400 --> 20:00.480\n strangely enough in this country today, seems to get a bad rap. Everybody's against the government.\n\n20:01.120 --> 20:04.640\n Yeah. Well, a lot of money has been spent on making people hate the government.\n\n20:04.640 --> 20:12.160\n But the reality is government does some things pretty well. I mean, government does health\n\n20:12.160 --> 20:17.760\n insurance pretty well. So much so, I mean, given our anti government bias, it really is true that\n\n20:17.760 --> 20:23.520\n there are people out there saying, don't let the government get its hands on Medicare. So\n\n20:24.560 --> 20:28.800\n people actually love the government health insurance program far more than they love\n\n20:28.800 --> 20:38.800\n private health insurance. Basic education. It turns out that your local public high school\n\n20:38.800 --> 20:45.760\n is the right place to have students trained and private for, certainly for profit education is\n\n20:46.800 --> 20:56.720\n by and large a nightmare of rip offs and grift and people not getting what they thought they\n\n20:56.720 --> 21:03.520\n were paying for. It's a judgment case. And it's funny, there are things, I mean, everybody talks\n\n21:05.520 --> 21:11.840\n about the DMV as being, do you want the economy? Actually, my experience is that the DMV have\n\n21:11.840 --> 21:17.920\n always been positive. Maybe I'm just going to the right DMVs, but in fact, a lot of government works\n\n21:17.920 --> 21:26.000\n pretty well. So to some extent, you can do these things on a priori grounds. You can talk about the\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:30.800\n logic of why healthcare is not going to be handled well by the market, but partly it's just experience.\n\n21:30.800 --> 21:34.800\n We tried, or at least some countries have tried nationalizing their steel industries,\n\n21:34.800 --> 21:40.640\n that didn't go well. But we've tried privatizing education and that didn't go well. So you find\n\n21:40.640 --> 21:49.120\n out what works. What about this new world of tech? How do you see, what do you think works for tech?\n\n21:49.120 --> 21:56.320\n Is it more regulation or less regulation? There are some things that need more regulation. I mean,\n\n21:56.320 --> 22:07.840\n we're finding out that the world of social media is one in which competitive forces aren't working\n\n22:07.840 --> 22:14.000\n very well and trusting the companies to regulate themselves isn't working very well. But I'm on the\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:19.440\n whole a tech skeptic, not in the sense that I think the tech doesn't work and it doesn't do stuff,\n\n22:19.440 --> 22:23.760\n but the idea that we're living through greater technological change than ever before\n\n22:24.400 --> 22:30.640\n is really an illusion. Ever since the beginning of the industrial revolution,\n\n22:30.640 --> 22:38.400\n we've had a series of epical shifts in the nature of work and in the kinds of jobs that are available.\n\n22:38.400 --> 22:46.720\n And it's not at all clear that what's happening now is any bigger or faster or harder to cope\n\n22:46.720 --> 22:54.560\n with than past shocks. It is a popular notion in today's sort of public discourse that automation\n\n22:54.560 --> 23:01.920\n is going to have a huge impact on the job market now. There is something transformational happening\n\n23:01.920 --> 23:10.800\n now. Can you talk about that, maybe elaborate a little bit more? Do you not see the software\n\n23:10.800 --> 23:18.320\n revolutions happening now with machine learning, availability of data, that kind of automation,\n\n23:18.320 --> 23:25.360\n being able to sort of process, clean, find patterns in data, and you don't see that\n\n23:25.360 --> 23:32.880\n disrupting any one sector to a point where there's a huge loss of jobs? There may be some things. I\n\n23:32.880 --> 23:37.120\n mean, actually, you know, translators, there's really reduced demand for translators because\n\n23:38.560 --> 23:45.200\n machine translation ain't perfect, but it ain't bad. There are some kinds of things that are\n\n23:45.200 --> 23:56.800\n changed, but overall productivity growth has actually been slow in recent years. It's been much\n\n23:56.800 --> 24:02.480\n slower than in some past periods. So the idea that automation is taking away all the jobs,\n\n24:02.480 --> 24:07.840\n the counterpart would be that we would be able to produce stuff with many fewer workers than before,\n\n24:07.840 --> 24:14.400\n and that's not happening. There are a few isolated sectors. There are some kinds of jobs that are\n\n24:14.400 --> 24:20.480\n going away, but that keeps on happening. I mean, New York City used to have thousands and thousands\n\n24:20.480 --> 24:29.760\n of longshoremen taking stuff off ships and putting them on ships. They're almost all gone now. Now\n\n24:29.760 --> 24:34.960\n you have the giant cranes taking containers on and off ships in Elizabeth, New Jersey.\n\n24:36.560 --> 24:44.000\n That's not robots. It doesn't sound high tech, but it actually pretty much destroyed an\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:50.960\n occupation. Well, you know, it wasn't fun for the longshoremen, to say the least. But it's not,\n\n24:52.560 --> 24:58.640\n we coped, we moved on, and that sort of thing happens all the time. You mean farmers.\n\n25:00.640 --> 25:07.520\n We used to be a nation which was mostly farmers. There are now very few farmers left. And the\n\n25:07.520 --> 25:14.000\n reason is not that we've stopped eating, it's that farming has become so efficient that we don't need\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:19.920\n a lot of farmers, and we coped with that too. So the idea that there's something qualitatively\n\n25:19.920 --> 25:26.880\n different about what's happening now so far isn't true. So your intuition is there is going to be\n\n25:26.880 --> 25:32.320\n lots of jobs, but it's just the thing that just continues. There's nothing qualitatively different\n\n25:32.320 --> 25:36.720\n about this moment. Some jobs will be lost, others will be created, as has always been the case so\n\n25:36.720 --> 25:42.880\n far. I mean, maybe there's a singularity. Maybe there's a moment when the machines get smarter\n\n25:42.880 --> 25:48.800\n than we are, and sky tech kills us all or something, right? But that's not visible in\n\n25:48.800 --> 25:53.600\n anything we're seeing now. You mentioned the metric of productivity. Could you explain that\n\n25:53.600 --> 25:58.080\n a little bit? Because it's a really interesting one. I've heard you mention that before in\n\n25:58.080 --> 26:03.760\n connection with automation. So what is that metric? And if there is something qualitatively\n\n26:03.760 --> 26:09.520\n different, what should we see in that metric? Well, okay, productivity. First of all, production.\n\n26:09.520 --> 26:15.760\n We do have a measure of the economy's total production, you know, real GDP, which is\n\n26:16.320 --> 26:21.280\n itself, it's a little bit of a construct because it's quite literally, it's adding apples and\n\n26:21.280 --> 26:27.600\n oranges. So we have to add together various things, which we basically do by using market prices,\n\n26:27.600 --> 26:32.800\n but we try to adjust for inflation. But it's kind of, it's a reasonable measure of how much\n\n26:32.800 --> 26:37.040\n the economy is producing. Sorry to interrupt. Is it goods and services? It's goods and services.\n\n26:37.040 --> 26:44.560\n It's everything. Okay. Productivity is, you divide that total output by the number of hours worked.\n\n26:45.200 --> 26:51.680\n So we're basically asking how much stuff does the average worker produce in an hour of work.\n\n26:52.320 --> 26:57.920\n And if you're seeing really rapid technological progress, then you'd expect to see productivity\n\n26:57.920 --> 27:05.040\n rising at a rapid clip, which we did, you know, for the generation after World War II, productivity\n\n27:05.040 --> 27:12.240\n rose, you know, 2% a year on a sustained basis. Then it dropped down for a while. Then there was\n\n27:12.240 --> 27:17.040\n a kind of a decade of fairly rapid growth from the mid nineties to the mid two thousands.\n\n27:18.240 --> 27:22.880\n And then it's, it dropped off again and it's not, it's not impressive right now. So\n\n27:22.880 --> 27:29.680\n you're just not seeing an epical shift in, in, in the economy. So let me then ask you about\n\n27:29.680 --> 27:34.720\n the psychology of blaming automation. A few months ago, you wrote in the New York Times,\n\n27:34.720 --> 27:39.840\n quote, the other day I found myself, as I often do at a conference, discussing lagging wages and\n\n27:39.840 --> 27:45.360\n soaring inequality. There was a lot of interesting discussion, but one thing that struck me was how\n\n27:45.360 --> 27:50.880\n many of the participants just assumed that robots are a big part of the problem, that machines are\n\n27:50.880 --> 27:56.400\n taking away the good jobs or even jobs in general. For the most part, this wasn't even presented as\n\n27:56.400 --> 28:04.640\n a hypothesis, just as part of what everyone knows. So why is, maybe can you psychoanalyze our,\n\n28:05.840 --> 28:12.480\n the public intellectuals or economists or us actually in the general public, why this is\n\n28:12.480 --> 28:19.440\n happening? Why this assumption has just infiltrated public discourse? There's a couple of things.\n\n28:19.440 --> 28:26.480\n One is that the particular technologies that are advancing now are ones that are a lot more visible\n\n28:26.480 --> 28:37.120\n to the chattering class. When containerization did away with the jobs of longshoremen, well,\n\n28:37.120 --> 28:43.280\n not a whole lot of college professors are close friends with longshoremen. And so we see this one.\n\n28:43.280 --> 28:49.920\n Then there's a second thing, which is, we just went through a severe financial crisis\n\n28:49.920 --> 28:56.880\n and a period of very high unemployment. It's finally come down. There's really no question\n\n28:56.880 --> 29:01.520\n that that high unemployment was about macroeconomics. It was about a failure of demand.\n\n29:02.160 --> 29:07.760\n But macroeconomics is really not intuitive. I mean, people just have a hard time wrapping\n\n29:07.760 --> 29:11.360\n their minds around it. And among other things, people have a hard time believing that something\n\n29:11.360 --> 29:16.160\n as trivial as, well, people who just aren't spending enough can lead to the kind of mass\n\n29:16.160 --> 29:22.320\n misery that we saw in the 1930s or the not quite so severe, but still serious misery that we saw\n\n29:22.320 --> 29:28.480\n after 2008. And there's always a tendency to say it must be something big. It must be technological\n\n29:28.480 --> 29:33.600\n change. That means we don't need workers anymore. There was a lot of that in the 30s. And that same\n\n29:33.600 --> 29:40.480\n thing happened after 2008, the assumption that it has to be some deep cause, not something as trivial\n\n29:40.480 --> 29:46.240\n as a failure of investor confidence and inadequate monetary and fiscal response.\n\n29:47.840 --> 29:57.280\n And the last thing on wages. A lot of what's happened on wages is at some level political.\n\n29:57.280 --> 30:02.320\n It's the collapse of the union movement. It's policies that have squeezed workers bargaining\n\n30:02.320 --> 30:08.880\n power. And for kind of obvious reasons, there are a lot of influential people who don't want to hear\n\n30:08.880 --> 30:14.880\n that story. They want it to be an inevitable force of nature. Technology has made it impossible to\n\n30:14.880 --> 30:23.440\n have people earn middle class wages. And so they don't like the story that says,\n\n30:23.440 --> 30:28.240\n actually, no, it's kind of the political decisions that we made that have caused this income\n\n30:28.240 --> 30:34.000\n stagnation. And so they're a receptive audience for technological determinism.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:40.640\n LW. So what comes first in your view, the economy or politics in terms of what has impact on the\n\n30:40.640 --> 30:41.360\n other?\n\n30:41.360 --> 30:48.800\n RL. Oh, look, everything interacts. That's one of the rules that I was taught in economics.\n\n30:48.800 --> 30:57.440\n Everything affects everything else in at least two ways. I mean, clearly the economy drives a\n\n30:57.440 --> 31:08.480\n lot of political stuff. But also clearly politics has a huge impact on the economy. We look at the\n\n31:08.480 --> 31:14.320\n decline of unions in America and say, well, the world has changed and unions don't have a role.\n\n31:15.040 --> 31:21.520\n But two thirds of workers in Denmark are unionized. And Denmark has the same technology\n\n31:21.520 --> 31:26.640\n and faces the same global economy that we do. It's just a difference in political choices that leads\n\n31:26.640 --> 31:33.760\n to that difference. So I actually teach a course here at CUNY called Economics of the Welfare\n\n31:33.760 --> 31:38.800\n State, which is about things like healthcare and retirement and to some extent wage policy and so\n\n31:38.800 --> 31:46.000\n on. And the message I keep on trying to drive home is that, look, all advanced countries have\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:51.280\n got roughly equal competence. We all have the same technology, but we make very different choices.\n\n31:51.840 --> 31:56.000\n Not that America always makes the wrong choices. We do some things pretty well. Our retirement\n\n31:56.000 --> 32:03.120\n system is one of the better ones. But the point is that there's a huge amount of political choice\n\n32:03.120 --> 32:09.840\n involved in the shape of the economy. What is a welfare state? Well, welfare state is the old\n\n32:10.720 --> 32:17.520\n term, but it basically refers to all the programs that are there to mitigate, if you like, the\n\n32:19.680 --> 32:25.200\n risks and injustices of the market economy. So in the US, the welfare state is Social Security,\n\n32:25.200 --> 32:32.240\n Medicare, Medicaid, minimum wages, food stamps. When you say welfare state, my first sort of\n\n32:32.240 --> 32:39.840\n feeling is a negative one. Even though I like all, I probably generally, at least theoretically,\n\n32:39.840 --> 32:46.480\n like all the welfare programs. Well, it's been demonized. And to some extent, I'm doing a little\n\n32:46.480 --> 32:53.520\n bit of thumbing my nose at all of that by just using the term welfare state. Although it's not.\n\n32:53.520 --> 32:59.600\n I see. Yeah, I got you. But everybody, every advanced country actually has a lot of welfare\n\n32:59.600 --> 33:07.200\n state, even the US. I mean, that's a fundamental part of the fabric of our society. Social Security,\n\n33:07.200 --> 33:17.840\n Medicare, Medicaid are just things we take for granted as part of the scene. There's a lot of\n\n33:17.840 --> 33:25.040\n there's people on the right wing who are saying, oh, it's all socialism. And well,\n\n33:25.040 --> 33:33.360\n words, I guess, mean what you want them to mean. And just today, I told my class about the\n\n33:36.160 --> 33:41.840\n record that Ronald Reagan made in 1961, warning that Medicare would destroy American freedom.\n\n33:41.840 --> 33:50.000\n And but that sort of didn't happen on the topic of welfare state. What are your thoughts on\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:58.800\n universal basic income? And that's sort of a not a generic, but a universal safety net of this kind?\n\n33:58.800 --> 34:04.320\n There's always a trade off when we talk about social safety net programs. There's always a\n\n34:04.320 --> 34:12.400\n trade off between universality, which is clean, but means that you're giving a lot of money to\n\n34:12.400 --> 34:19.120\n people who don't necessarily need it and some kind of targeting, which makes it easier to\n\n34:20.720 --> 34:27.520\n get to deal with the crucial problems with limited resources. But both has incentive\n\n34:27.520 --> 34:36.480\n problems and kind of political and I would say even psychological issues. So the great thing\n\n34:36.480 --> 34:44.000\n about Social Security and Medicare is no questions asked. You don't have to prove that you need them.\n\n34:45.280 --> 34:54.800\n It just comes. I'm on Medicare, allegedly. I mean, it's run through my New York Times health\n\n34:54.800 --> 35:02.160\n insurance, but I didn't have to file an application with the Medicare office to prove that I needed it.\n\n35:02.160 --> 35:08.160\n It just happened when I turned 65. That's good for dignity and it's also good for\n\n35:08.800 --> 35:15.360\n the political support because everybody gets Medicare. On the other hand, if you\n\n35:15.360 --> 35:24.640\n and we can do that with health care to give everybody a guarantee of an income that's\n\n35:24.640 --> 35:32.480\n enough to live on comfortably. That's a lot of money. What about enough income to carry you over\n\n35:34.240 --> 35:38.000\n through difficult periods, like if you lose a job or that kind of? Well, we have unemployment\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:44.080\n insurance and I think our unemployment insurance is too short lived and too stingy. It would be\n\n35:44.080 --> 35:51.840\n better to have a more comprehensive unemployment insurance benefit. But the trouble with something\n\n35:51.840 --> 35:58.720\n like universal basic income is that either the bar is too low, so it's really not something you\n\n35:58.720 --> 36:05.680\n can live on, or it's an enormously expensive program. And so at this point, I think that\n\n36:05.680 --> 36:12.000\n we can do far better by building on the kinds of safety net programs we have. I mean, food stamps,\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:17.280\n earned income tax credit. We should have a lot more family support policies.\n\n36:17.280 --> 36:23.280\n Those things can do a lot more to really diminish the amount of misery in this country.\n\n36:24.240 --> 36:32.560\n UBI is something that is being... I mean, it goes kind of hand in hand with this belief that\n\n36:33.120 --> 36:37.440\n the robots are going to take all of our jobs. And if that was really happening, then I might\n\n36:37.440 --> 36:45.840\n reconsider my views on UPI, but I don't see that happening. So are you happy with discourse that's\n\n36:45.840 --> 36:52.160\n going on now in terms of politics? So you mentioned a few political candidates. Is the kind of thing\n\n36:52.160 --> 36:59.680\n going on both on Twitter and debates and the media through the written word, through the spoken word,\n\n37:00.240 --> 37:05.120\n how do you assess the public discourse now in terms of politics? We're in a fragmented world.\n\n37:05.120 --> 37:07.680\n More so than before.\n\n37:07.680 --> 37:20.560\n More so than ever before. So at this point, the public discourse that you see if Fox News is your\n\n37:20.560 --> 37:25.600\n principal news source is very different from the one you get if you read the New York Times.\n\n37:26.160 --> 37:33.840\n On the whole, my sense is that mainstream political reporting, policy reporting is a,\n\n37:33.840 --> 37:40.880\n not too great, but b, better than it's ever been. Because when I first got into the pundit business,\n\n37:41.440 --> 37:46.640\n it was just awful. Lots of things just never got covered. And if things did get covered,\n\n37:46.640 --> 37:53.680\n it was always both sides. It's the line that comes back from me writing during the 2000\n\n37:53.680 --> 38:00.320\n campaign was that if one of the candidates said that the earth was flat, the headline would\n\n38:00.320 --> 38:06.560\n be views differ on shape of planet. I mean, that's less true. There's still a fair bit of\n\n38:06.560 --> 38:12.240\n that out there, but it's less true than there used to be. And there are more people reporting,\n\n38:12.240 --> 38:18.880\n writing on policy issues who actually understand them than ever before. So though that's good.\n\n38:18.880 --> 38:34.640\n But still, how much the typical voter is actually informed is unclear. I mean, the Democratic\n\n38:34.640 --> 38:44.560\n debates, I'm hoping that we finally get down to not having 27 people on the stage or whatever it\n\n38:44.560 --> 38:52.880\n is they have, but they're reasonably substantive, certainly better than before. And while there's\n\n38:52.880 --> 39:00.560\n a lot of still theater criticism instead of actual analysis and the reporting, it's not as totally\n\n39:00.560 --> 39:09.200\n dominant as in the past. Can I ask maybe a dumb question, but from an open minded perspective,\n\n39:09.200 --> 39:21.920\n when people on the left and people on the right, I think view the others as sometimes complete\n\n39:21.920 --> 39:32.560\n idiots. What do we do with that? Is it possible that the people on the right are correct about\n\n39:32.560 --> 39:42.480\n their what they currently believe? Is that kind of open mindedness helpful or is this division\n\n39:43.280 --> 39:47.280\n long term productive for us to sort of have this food fight?\n\n39:48.480 --> 39:55.680\n Well, the trouble you have to confront is that there's a lot of stuff that just is false out\n\n39:55.680 --> 40:02.160\n there but commands extensive political allegiance. So the idea, well, both sides need to listen to\n\n40:02.160 --> 40:09.840\n each other respectfully. I'm happy to do that when there's a view that is worthy of respect,\n\n40:09.840 --> 40:18.000\n but a lot of stuff is not. And so take economics is something where I think I know something,\n\n40:18.560 --> 40:24.800\n and I'm not sure that I'm always right. In fact, I know I've been wrong plenty of times. But I\n\n40:24.800 --> 40:33.280\n think that there is a difference between economic views that are within the realm of we can actually\n\n40:33.280 --> 40:42.560\n have an interesting discussion and those that are just crank doctrines or things that are purely\n\n40:42.560 --> 40:47.920\n being disseminated because people are being paid to disseminate them. So there are plenty of good,\n\n40:47.920 --> 40:54.800\n serious center right economists that I'm happy to talk to. None of those center right economists\n\n40:54.800 --> 40:59.280\n has any role in the Trump administration. The Trump administration and by and large Republicans\n\n40:59.280 --> 41:07.680\n in Congress only want to listen to people who are cranks. And so I think it's being dishonest with\n\n41:07.680 --> 41:12.400\n my readers to pretend otherwise. There's no way I can reach out to people who think that\n\n41:12.400 --> 41:16.480\n reading Ayn Rand novels is how you learn about monetary economics.\n\n41:17.200 --> 41:22.000\n Let me linger on that point. So if you look at Ayn Rand, okay, so you said center right. What\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:31.600\n about extreme? People who have like radical views, you think they're not grounded in any kind of data,\n\n41:31.600 --> 41:37.920\n in any kind of reality. I'm just sort of curious about how open we should be\n\n41:37.920 --> 41:44.320\n to ideas that seem radical. Oh, radical ideas is fine, but then you have to ask, is there some\n\n41:44.320 --> 41:53.920\n basis for the radicalism? And if it's something that is not grounded in anything,\n\n41:55.440 --> 41:59.840\n then, and particularly, by the way, if it's something that's been refuted by evidence again\n\n41:59.840 --> 42:03.440\n and again, and the people just keep saying it, if it's a zombie, if it's a\n\n42:03.440 --> 42:08.560\n zombie idea, and there's a lot of those out there, then there comes a point when it's not worth\n\n42:09.600 --> 42:14.560\n trying to fake respect for it. I see. So there's a, through the scientific process,\n\n42:14.560 --> 42:19.760\n you've shown that this idea does not hold water, but I like the idea of zombie ideas,\n\n42:19.760 --> 42:25.040\n but they live on through, it's like the idea that the earth is flat, for example,\n\n42:26.160 --> 42:28.880\n has been for the most part, disproven. Yeah.\n\n42:28.880 --> 42:34.480\n But it lives on, actually, and growing in popularity currently. Yeah. And there's a lot\n\n42:34.480 --> 42:41.520\n of that out there, and you can't wish it away, and you're not being fair to either yourself,\n\n42:41.520 --> 42:46.160\n or if you're somebody who writes for the public, you're not being fair to your readers to pretend\n\n42:46.160 --> 42:53.920\n otherwise. So quantum mechanics is a strange theory, but it's testable, and so while being\n\n42:53.920 --> 43:00.400\n strange, it's widely accepted amongst physicists. How robust and testable are economics theories\n\n43:01.440 --> 43:08.160\n if we compare them to quantum mechanics and physics and so on? Okay, economics, look, it's a\n\n43:08.160 --> 43:13.920\n complex system, and it's also one in which, by and large, you don't get to do experiments,\n\n43:14.480 --> 43:18.480\n and so economics is never going to be like quantum mechanics.\n\n43:18.480 --> 43:26.160\n That said, you get natural experiments, you get tests of rival doctrines. In the immediate\n\n43:26.160 --> 43:35.600\n aftermath of the financial crisis, there was one style, one basic theory of macroeconomics, which\n\n43:36.560 --> 43:40.960\n ultimately goes back to John Maynard Keynes that made a few predictions. It said, under these\n\n43:40.960 --> 43:48.080\n circumstances, the economy is going to collapse. It's going to collapse. It's going to collapse.\n\n43:48.080 --> 43:54.800\n Printing money will not be inflationary. Running big budget deficits will not cause a rise in\n\n43:54.800 --> 44:02.240\n interest rates. Slashing government spending austerity policies will lead to depressions if\n\n44:02.240 --> 44:11.120\n tried. Other people had exactly the opposite predictions, and we got a fairly robust test,\n\n44:11.120 --> 44:17.600\n and one theory won. Interest rates stayed low. Inflation stayed low. Austerity, countries that\n\n44:17.600 --> 44:24.400\n implemented harsh austerity policies suffered severe economic downturns. You don't get much,\n\n44:24.400 --> 44:28.400\n you know, that's pretty clear, and that's not going to be true on everything,\n\n44:29.440 --> 44:36.560\n but there's a lot of empirical. I mean, the younger economists these days are very heavily\n\n44:36.560 --> 44:42.000\n data based, and that's great, and I think that's the way to go.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:47.440\n Trey Lockerbie What theories of economics are there? Is there currently a lot of disagreement about, would you say?\n\n44:47.440 --> 44:54.560\n John Ligato Oh, first of all, there's just a lot less disagreement, really, among serious\n\n44:54.560 --> 45:00.800\n researchers in economics than people imagine. We actually, we can track that. The Chicago Booth\n\n45:00.800 --> 45:07.520\n School has a panel, an ideologically diverse panel, and they pose regularly posed questions,\n\n45:07.520 --> 45:16.160\n and on most things, there's a huge, there's remarkable consensus. There's a lot of things\n\n45:16.160 --> 45:22.240\n where people imagine that there's dispute, but the illusion of dispute is something that's\n\n45:22.240 --> 45:28.960\n basically being fed by political forces, and there isn't really. I mean, there are, I think,\n\n45:28.960 --> 45:37.760\n questions about what are effective ways to regulate technology industries. We really don't know\n\n45:41.520 --> 45:50.560\n the answers there. There's a, or, look, I don't follow every part. Minimum wages. I think there's\n\n45:50.560 --> 45:57.280\n pretty overwhelming evidence that a modest increase in the minimum wage from current levels\n\n45:57.280 --> 46:06.960\n would be, would not have any noticeable adverse effect on jobs. But if you ask, how high could it\n\n46:06.960 --> 46:17.040\n go? $12 seems pretty safe, given what we know. Is $15 okay? There's some legitimate disagreement\n\n46:17.040 --> 46:24.880\n there, I think probably, but people have a point. $20, where is the line at which it starts to\n\n46:24.880 --> 46:29.440\n become a problem, and the answer is, truly, we don't know. It's fascinating to try to,\n\n46:30.080 --> 46:35.120\n such a cool, economics is cool in that sense, because you're trying to predict something that\n\n46:35.120 --> 46:39.440\n hasn't been done before, the impact, the effects of something that hasn't been done before.\n\n46:40.160 --> 46:45.200\n Yeah, you're trying, you're going out of sample, and we have good reason to believe that there are,\n\n46:46.560 --> 46:49.840\n you know, that it's nonlinear, that there comes a point at which it doesn't work the way it has\n\n46:49.840 --> 46:56.560\n in the past. So, as an economist, how do you see science and technological innovation? When I\n\n46:56.560 --> 47:02.160\n took various economics courses in college, technological innovation seemed like a\n\n47:02.160 --> 47:09.280\n no brainer way of growing an economy, and we should invest in it aggressively. I may be biased,\n\n47:09.280 --> 47:14.720\n but it seemed like the various ways to grow an economy, it seems like the easiest way,\n\n47:14.720 --> 47:20.560\n especially long term. Is that correct? And if so, why aren't we doing it more?\n\n47:20.560 --> 47:26.880\n Well, that's, okay, the first question is, yeah, I mean, all, it's pretty much overwhelming.\n\n47:27.920 --> 47:31.520\n We think we can more or less measure this, although there are some assumptions involved,\n\n47:31.520 --> 47:38.480\n but it's something like 70 to 80% of the growth in per capita income is basically the advance\n\n47:38.480 --> 47:43.520\n of knowledge. It's not just, it's not just the crude accumulation of capital. It is the fact\n\n47:43.520 --> 47:50.560\n that we get smarter. A lot of that, by the way, is more prosaic kinds of technology. So, you know,\n\n47:52.960 --> 47:57.760\n I like to talk about things like containerization, or, you know, in an earlier period,\n\n48:01.280 --> 48:10.000\n the invention of the flat pack cardboard box. That had to be invented, and now all of your\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:14.720\n deliveries from Amazon are made possible by the existence of that technology. The web stuff is\n\n48:15.760 --> 48:19.040\n important too, but what would we do without cardboard boxes?\n\n48:20.400 --> 48:26.160\n But all of that stuff is really important in driving economic progress. Well, why don't we\n\n48:26.160 --> 48:36.560\n invest more? Why don't we invest more in, again, more prosaic stuff? Why haven't we built another\n\n48:36.560 --> 48:44.320\n goddamn rail tunnel under the Hudson River, for which the need is so totally overwhelmingly\n\n48:44.320 --> 48:48.000\n obvious? How do you think about, first of all, I don't even know what the word prosaic means,\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:54.320\n but I inferred it, but how do you think about prosaic? Is it the really most basic, dumb\n\n48:54.320 --> 49:02.800\n technology innovation, or is it just like the lowest hanging fruit of where benefit can be\n\n49:02.800 --> 49:11.760\n gained? When I say prosaic, I mean stuff that is not sexy and fancy and high tech. It's building\n\n49:11.760 --> 49:24.400\n bridges and tunnels, inventing the cardboard box, or the, I don't know, where do we put\n\n49:24.400 --> 49:34.800\n EasyPass in there? It is actually using some modern technology and all that, but it's not\n\n49:34.800 --> 49:41.120\n going to have, I don't think we're going to make a movie about the guy, whoever it was that invented\n\n49:41.120 --> 49:47.680\n EasyPass, but it's actually a pretty significant productivity booster. To me, it always seemed like\n\n49:47.680 --> 49:55.360\n it's something that everybody should be able to agree on and just invest. So in the same way,\n\n49:56.160 --> 50:05.440\n the investment in the military and the DOD is huge. So everyone kind of, not everyone, but\n\n50:05.440 --> 50:15.280\n there's an agreement amongst people that somehow that a large defense is important. It always\n\n50:15.280 --> 50:22.720\n seemed to me like that should be shifted towards, if you want to grow prosperity of the nation,\n\n50:22.720 --> 50:28.320\n you should be investing in knowledge. Yes, prosaic stuff, investing in infrastructure and so on.\n\n50:29.200 --> 50:34.080\n I mean, sorry to linger on it, but do you have any intuition? Do you have a hope that that changes?\n\n50:35.040 --> 50:38.240\n Do you have intuition why it's not changing? It's unclear.\n\n50:38.240 --> 50:42.240\n More than intuition, I have a theory. I'm reasonably certain that I understand why\n\n50:42.240 --> 50:55.680\n we don't do it. And it's because we have a real values dispute about the welfare state,\n\n50:55.680 --> 51:02.080\n about how much the government should do to help the unfortunate. And politicians believe,\n\n51:04.320 --> 51:09.200\n probably rightly, that there's a kind of halo effect that surrounds any kind of government\n\n51:09.200 --> 51:17.600\n intervention. That even though providing people with enhanced social security benefits is really\n\n51:17.600 --> 51:23.520\n very different from building a tunnel under the Hudson River, politicians of both parties seem\n\n51:23.520 --> 51:28.240\n to believe that if the government is seen to be successful at doing one kind of thing,\n\n51:28.240 --> 51:33.120\n it will make people think more favorably on doing other kinds of things. And so we have\n\n51:33.120 --> 51:39.680\n conservatives tend to be opposed to any kind of increase in government spending, except military,\n\n51:39.680 --> 51:46.720\n no matter how obviously a good idea it is, because they fear that it's the thin end of\n\n51:46.720 --> 51:52.480\n the wedge for bigger government in general. And to some extent, liberals tend to favor\n\n51:53.040 --> 51:59.760\n spending on these things, partly because they see it as a way of proving that government can\n\n51:59.760 --> 52:11.360\n do things well, and therefore it can turn to broader social goals. What you might have thought\n\n52:11.360 --> 52:15.440\n would be a technocratic discussion about government investment, both in research and\n\n52:15.440 --> 52:21.520\n in infrastructure, is contaminated by the fact that government is government and people link it\n\n52:21.520 --> 52:28.560\n to other government actions. Perhaps a silly question, but as a species, we're currently\n\n52:28.560 --> 52:35.040\n working on venturing out into space, one day colonizing Mars. So when we start a society\n\n52:35.040 --> 52:41.040\n on Mars from scratch, what political and economic system should it operate under?\n\n52:41.920 --> 52:45.760\n Oh, I'm a big believer in... First of all, I don't think we're actually going to do that,\n\n52:45.760 --> 52:54.000\n but let's hypothesize that we colonize Mars or something. Look, representative democracy\n\n52:54.000 --> 53:06.960\n versus pure democracy. Well, yeah, pure democracy where people vote directly on everything is really\n\n53:06.960 --> 53:16.000\n problematic, because people don't have time to try and master every issue. I mean, we can see\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:21.920\n what government by referendum looks like. There's a lot of that in California, and it doesn't work\n\n53:21.920 --> 53:26.800\n so good because it's hard to explain to people that the various things they vote for may conflict.\n\n53:26.800 --> 53:37.520\n So representative democracy, it's got lots of problems. And kind of the Winston Churchill thing,\n\n53:37.520 --> 53:43.760\n right? It's the worst system we know, except for all the others. So yeah, sticking with the\n\n53:43.760 --> 53:52.240\n representative and basically the American system of regulation and markets and the economy we have\n\n53:52.240 --> 53:57.760\n going on is a pretty good one for Mars. If you start from scratch. If you're gonna start from\n\n53:57.760 --> 54:04.320\n scratch, you wouldn't want a Senate where 16% of the population has half the seats.\n\n54:06.160 --> 54:11.360\n You probably would want one which is actually more representative than what we have.\n\n54:11.360 --> 54:22.080\n And the details, it's unclear. When times are good, all of the various representative\n\n54:22.080 --> 54:30.480\n democracy systems, whether it's parliamentary democracies or a US style system, whether you\n\n54:30.480 --> 54:35.120\n have a prime minister or the head of state as an elected president, they all kind of work well,\n\n54:36.080 --> 54:40.240\n when times are good, and they all have different modes of breakdown. So I'm not sure I know what\n\n54:40.240 --> 54:49.760\n the answer is. But something like that is given what we've seen through history, it's the least\n\n54:49.760 --> 55:02.240\n bad system out there. I'm a big fan of the TV series The Expanse, and it's kind of gratifying\n\n55:02.240 --> 55:13.600\n that out there, it's the Martian Congressional Republic. In a brief sense, so amongst many things,\n\n55:13.600 --> 55:24.000\n you're also an expert at international trade. What do you make of the complexity? So I can\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:30.560\n understand trade between two people, say two neighboring farmers. It seems pretty straightforward\n\n55:30.560 --> 55:35.280\n to me. But internationally, we need to start talking about nations and nations trading seems\n\n55:35.280 --> 55:42.080\n to be very complicated. So from a high level, why is it so complicated? What are all the different\n\n55:42.080 --> 55:48.720\n factors that weigh the objectives that need to be considered in international trade? And maybe\n\n55:48.720 --> 55:55.680\n feeding that into a question of, do you have concerns about the two giants right now of the\n\n55:55.680 --> 56:01.520\n U.S. and China, and the tension that's going on with the international trade there with the trade\n\n56:01.520 --> 56:05.680\n war? Well, first of all, international trade is not really that different from trade among\n\n56:05.680 --> 56:15.200\n individuals. It's vastly more complex, and there are many more players. But in the end, the reasons\n\n56:15.200 --> 56:19.280\n why countries trade are pretty much the same as the reasons why individuals trade. Countries trade\n\n56:19.280 --> 56:25.120\n because they're different, and they can derive mutual advantage from concentrating on the things\n\n56:25.120 --> 56:36.320\n they do relatively well. And also, there are economies of scale. Individuals have to decide\n\n56:36.320 --> 56:42.160\n whether to be a surgeon or an accountant. It's probably not a good idea to try and be both,\n\n56:42.160 --> 56:48.400\n and countries benefit from specializing just because of the inherent advantages of specialization.\n\n56:48.400 --> 56:56.160\n Now, the fact that it's a big world, and we're talking about millions of products being traded,\n\n56:56.160 --> 57:05.040\n and in today's world, often trade involves many stages. So that made in China iPhone is actually\n\n57:05.840 --> 57:11.520\n assembled from components that are made all over the world. But it doesn't really change the\n\n57:11.520 --> 57:22.080\n fundamentals all that much. There's a recurrent... I mean, the dirty little secret of international\n\n57:22.080 --> 57:27.840\n trade conflict is that actually it's not... Conflicts among countries are really not that\n\n57:27.840 --> 57:37.440\n important. Most trade is beneficial to both sides and to both countries, but it has big impacts on\n\n57:37.440 --> 57:44.720\n the distribution of income within countries. So the growth of US trade with China has made both\n\n57:44.720 --> 57:52.320\n US and China richer, but it's been pretty bad for people who were employed in the North Carolina\n\n57:52.320 --> 57:58.480\n furniture industry, who did find that their jobs were displaced by a wave of imports from China.\n\n57:58.480 --> 58:08.000\n And so that's where the complexity comes in. Not at all clear to me. We have some real problems\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:14.480\n with China, although they don't really involve trade so much as things like respect for intellectual\n\n58:14.480 --> 58:22.080\n property. Not clear that those real problems that we do have with China have anything to do with the\n\n58:22.080 --> 58:28.960\n current trade war. The current trade war seems to be driven instead by a fundamentally wrong notion\n\n58:28.960 --> 58:33.680\n that when we sell goods to China, that's good, and when we buy goods from China, that's bad. And\n\n58:33.680 --> 58:39.600\n that's misunderstanding the whole point. Is trade with China in both directions a good thing?\n\n58:40.480 --> 58:46.720\n Yeah, we would be poorer if it wasn't for it. But there are downsides, as there are for any economic\n\n58:46.720 --> 58:53.520\n change. It's like any new technology makes us richer, but often hurts some people. Trade with\n\n58:53.520 --> 59:01.680\n China makes us richer, but hurts some people. And I wouldn't undo what has happened, but I wish we\n\n59:01.680 --> 59:07.680\n had had a better policy for supporting and compensating the losers from that growth.\n\n59:09.200 --> 59:14.880\n So we live in a time of radicalization of political ideas, Twitter mobs, and so on.\n\n59:14.880 --> 59:21.600\n And yet here you are in the midst of it, both tweeting and writing in the New York Times articles\n\n59:21.600 --> 59:29.040\n with strong opinions, riding this chaotic wave of public discourse. Do you ever hesitate or feel\n\n59:29.040 --> 59:34.160\n a tinge of fear for exploring your ideas publicly and unapologetically?\n\n59:34.160 --> 59:40.640\n Oh, I feel fear all the time. It's not too hard to imagine scenarios in which this is going to,\n\n59:40.640 --> 59:49.360\n you know, I might personally find myself kind of in the crosshairs. And I mean, I am the\n\n59:49.360 --> 59:55.600\n king of hate mail. I get amazing correspondence. Does it affect you?\n\n59:55.600 --> 1:00:00.000\n It did. It did when it started. These days I've developed a very thick skin.\n\n1:00:01.600 --> 1:00:07.520\n So I don't usually get, in fact, if I don't get a wave of hate mail after a column, then\n\n1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:10.480\n I've probably wasted that day.\n\n1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:16.240\n So what do you make of that as a person who's putting ideas out there? If you look at the\n\n1:00:16.240 --> 1:00:22.400\n history of ideas, the way it works is you write about ideas, you put them out there. But now\n\n1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:29.120\n when there's so much hate mail, so much division, what advice do you have for yourself and for\n\n1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:33.200\n others trying to have a discussion about ideas, difficult ideas?\n\n1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:40.720\n Well, I don't know about advice for others. I mean, for most economists, you know, just\n\n1:00:40.720 --> 1:00:46.880\n do your research. We can't all be public intellectuals and we shouldn't try to be.\n\n1:00:46.880 --> 1:00:55.360\n And in fact, I'm glad that I didn't get into this business until I was in my late 40s. I mean,\n\n1:00:55.360 --> 1:01:03.840\n this is probably best to spend your decades of greatest intellectual flexibility addressing\n\n1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:12.880\n deep questions, not confronting Twitter mobs. And as for the rest, I think when you're writing\n\n1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:23.280\n about stuff, the answers like no one's watching, write like nobody's reading. Write what you think\n\n1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:28.480\n is right. Trying to make it, obviously, trying to make it comprehensible and persuasive. But\n\n1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:38.080\n don't let yourself get intimidated by the fact that some people are going to say nasty things.\n\n1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:47.200\n You can't do your job if you are worried about criticism.\n\n1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:52.320\n Well, I think I speak for a lot of people in saying that I hope that you keep dancing like\n\n1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:58.960\n nobody's watching on Twitter and New York Times and books. So Paul, it's been an honor. Thank you\n\n1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:03.920\n so much for talking to me. Great.

And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:39.840\n from Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations, one of the most influential philosophers and economists\n\n1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:45.280\n in our history. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we\n\n1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:51.280\n expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to their\n\n1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:59.040\n humanity, but to their self love and never talk to them of our necessities, but of their advantages.\n\n1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:14.400\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
