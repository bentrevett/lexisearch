00:08.160\n host of The Rising with Crystal Ball\n\n00:08.160 --> 00:12.600\n and host of the realignment podcast with Marshall Kozloff.\n\n00:12.600 --> 00:16.480\n He has interviewed Donald Trump four times\n\n00:16.480 --> 00:19.760\n and has interviewed a lot of major political figures\n\n00:19.760 --> 00:23.080\n and human beings who wield power.\n\n00:23.080 --> 00:25.880\n He loves policy and loves history,\n\n00:25.880 --> 00:27.960\n which makes him a great person to sail\n\n00:27.960 --> 00:32.680\n through the sometimes stormy waters of political discourse.\n\n00:32.680 --> 00:35.440\n He showed up to this conversation with a gift\n\n00:35.440 --> 00:40.200\n of the second volume of Ian Kershaw's biography on Hitler,\n\n00:40.200 --> 00:42.360\n a two volume set that is widely acknowledged\n\n00:42.360 --> 00:45.200\n as one of the greatest, if not the greatest,\n\n00:45.200 --> 00:48.320\n most definitive studies of Hitler.\n\n00:48.320 --> 00:51.400\n Nothing wins my heart faster on a first meeting\n\n00:51.400 --> 00:55.160\n or first date than a great book about the darkest aspects\n\n00:55.160 --> 00:57.520\n of human nature and human history.\n\n00:57.520 --> 00:59.360\n I think I started saying that as a joke,\n\n00:59.360 --> 01:01.560\n but actually there's probably a lot of truth to it.\n\n01:01.560 --> 01:03.200\n I love it when we skip the small talk\n\n01:03.200 --> 01:05.480\n and go straight to the in depth conversation\n\n01:05.480 --> 01:09.000\n about the best and worst of human nature.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:12.480\n Quick mention of our

worse,\n\n01:26.600 --> 01:27.920\n I would like to avoid the trap\n\n01:27.920 --> 01:30.460\n of surface political bickering of the day.\n\n01:30.460 --> 01:32.460\n I do find politics fascinating,\n\n01:32.460 --> 01:34.240\n but not the talking points produced\n\n01:34.240 --> 01:37.140\n by the industrial engagement complex\n\n01:37.140 --> 01:38.920\n of red versus blue division.\n\n01:38.920 --> 01:42.520\n Instead, I'm fascinated by human beings who seek power\n\n01:42.520 --> 01:44.920\n and how power changes them.\n\n01:44.920 --> 01:47.000\n I don't have a political affiliation\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:49.120\n and my ideas, at least I hope so,\n\n01:49.120 --> 01:51.800\n are defined more by curiosity and learning\n\n01:51.800 --> 01:53.400\n in the face of uncertainty\n\n01:53.400 --> 01:56.560\n and less by the echo chambers who tell me\n\n01:56.560 --> 01:58.460\n what I'm supposed to think.\n\n01:58.460 --> 02:00.920\n I'm constantly evolving, learning,\n\n02:00.920 --> 02:04.280\n and doing my best to do so without ego and with empathy.\n\n02:04.280 --> 02:05.960\n Please be patient with me.\n\n02:05.960 --> 02:07.040\n As far as I'm aware,\n\n02:07.040 --> 02:09.400\n I do not have any derangement syndromes,\n\n02:09.400 --> 02:11.120\n nor do I get a medical prescription\n\n02:11.120 --> 02:14.420\n of blue, red, white, or black pills.\n\n02:14.420 --> 02:18.240\n If I say something, I say it because I'm genuinely thinking\n\n02:18.240 --> 02:21.120\n and struggling with the ideas.\n\n02:21.120 --> 02:23.840\n I have no agenda, just a bit of a hope\n\n02:23.840 --> 02:26.680\n to add more love to the world.\n\n02:26.680 --> 02:29.160\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n02:29.160 --> 02:32.220\n review

now, here's my conversation with Sagar Anjati.\n\n02:41.120 --> 02:44.760\n There's no better gifts in this world\n\n02:44.760 --> 02:47.840\n than a book about Hitler, so thank you so much.\n\n02:47.840 --> 02:50.780\n I've gotten a gift when we were just talking about flying,\n\n02:50.780 --> 02:52.400\n the watch from Joe Rogan,\n\n02:52.400 --> 02:54.400\n and this almost beats it.\n\n02:54.400 --> 02:58.800\n So tell me what this particular book on Hitler is.\n\n02:58.800 --> 02:59.880\n So this is volume two.\n\n02:59.880 --> 03:01.980\n Yes, so this is Ian Kershaw.\n\n03:01.980 --> 03:04.520\n He wrote the famous two volume on Hitler.\n\n03:04.520 --> 03:05.800\n I'm a big book nerd,\n\n03:05.800 --> 03:09.180\n and I spend a lot of time reading biographies in particular.\n\n03:09.180 --> 03:11.940\n So this one, if you need a one volume,\n\n03:11.940 --> 03:13.840\n \"'Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,' right?\n\n03:13.840 --> 03:15.520\n I think you talked about that, William Shire,\n\n03:15.520 --> 03:17.540\n because that's like Hitler's rise,\n\n03:17.540 --> 03:19.320\n Nazi Germany, the war, et cetera.\n\n03:19.320 --> 03:23.760\n But I like bios because a good biography\n\n03:23.760 --> 03:25.200\n is story of the times, right?\n\n03:25.200 --> 03:28.380\n And so this one, the first volume, it does exactly that,\n\n03:28.380 --> 03:30.880\n which is that it doesn't just tell the story of Hitler.\n\n03:30.880 --> 03:34.200\n It's the context of this kid in Austria,\n\n03:34.200 --> 03:35.320\n and he's got all these dreams,\n\n03:35.320 --> 03:37.380\n but then actually pretty courageous\n\n03:37.380 --> 03:38.840\n in terms of World War I, right?\n\n03:38.840 --> 03:40.760\n Gets pinned to metal on by the Kaiser.\n\n03:40.760 --> 03:44.120\n And then what it's like to lose World War I,\n\n03:44.120 --> 03:47.000\n and actually lose this stain,\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:49.800\n and then the rise within, everybody knows that story,\n\n03:49.800 --> 03:51.560\n the Beer Hall Putsch and all that.\n\n03:51.560 --> 03:53.960\n This one I like, and the reason I like Kershaw\n\n03:53.960 --> 03:55.680\n is obviously number one, it's English,\n\n03:55.680 --> 03:57.000\n which is actually hard, right?\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:58.560\n Like in order to write that story,\n\n03:58.560 --> 04:01.060\n who can do both the primary source material\n\n04:01.060 --> 04:03.180\n and then translate it for people like us,\n\n04:03.180 --> 04:08.020\n but he tells the dynamic story of Hitler so well\n\n04:08.020 --> 04:10.920\n in the second volume, just like the level of detail.\n\n04:10.920 --> 04:12.220\n You've talked about this, Lex,\n\n04:12.220 --> 04:14.880\n like what was it like inside that room,\n\n04:14.880 --> 04:16.200\n inside with Chamberlain?\n\n04:16.200 --> 04:19.240\n Like what was it like in terms of who was this\n\n04:19.240 --> 04:22.520\n like magnetic madman who did convince\n\n04:22.520 --> 04:24.680\n the smartest people in the world at the time?\n\n04:24.680 --> 04:28.900\n And up until like 1940, the Soviet gamble,\n\n04:28.900 --> 04:33.900\n like it took tremendous risks, but like highly calculated,\n\n04:34.320 --> 04:36.480\n thinking, no, no, no, I'm not gonna pay for this one.\n\n04:36.480 --> 04:37.760\n I'm not gonna pay for this one.\n\n04:37.760 --> 04:40.520\n And it put himself, he had a remarkable ability,\n\n04:40.520 --> 04:42.920\n not just to put himself in the minds of the German people,\n\n04:42.920 --> 04:44.400\n but in terms of his adversaries,\n\n04:44.400 --> 04:46.600\n like with when he was across from Mussolini.\n\n04:46.600 --> 04:48.760\n Calculate, he's like, how exactly did Mussolini,\n\n04:48.760 --> 04:49.800\n the guy who created fascism,\n\n04:49.800 --> 04:52.440\n becomes like second fiddle to Hitler?\n\n04:52.440 --> 04:53.640\n Think it's an amazing bio.\n\n04:53.640 --> 04:57.920\n And yeah, like Ian Kershaw, along with Richard Evans,\n\n04:57.920 --> 05:00.280\n two of my favorite authors on the Third Reich, no question.\n\n05:00.280 --> 05:01.600\n Do you think he was born this way,\n\n05:01.600 --> 05:03.360\n that charisma, whatever that is?\n\n05:03.360 --> 05:06.040\n Or was it something he developed strategically?\n\n05:06.040 --> 05:07.200\n That's like the question you apply\n\n05:07.200 --> 05:09.200\n to some of the great leaders.\n\n05:09.200 --> 05:13.520\n Was he just a madman who had the instinct\n\n05:13.520 --> 05:15.280\n to be able to control people\n\n05:15.280 --> 05:16.540\n in the room together with them?\n\n05:16.540 --> 05:17.960\n Or is this like, he worked at it?\n\n05:17.960 --> 05:19.280\n I think he worked at it.\n\n05:19.280 --> 05:21.620\n But also, there is an innate quality.\n\n05:21.620 --> 05:24.280\n I'm forgetting his name, his lifelong,\n\n05:24.280 --> 05:27.960\n Rudolf, the one who flew to Berlin in like 1940.\n\n05:27.960 --> 05:29.320\n I forget his name, anyway.\n\n05:29.320 --> 05:31.560\n So he helped Hitler write Mein Kampf.\n\n05:31.560 --> 05:35.600\n And he was like slavishly devoted to him in prison.\n\n05:35.600 --> 05:38.560\n This is 1925 or something like that.\n\n05:38.560 --> 05:39.880\n And so you read that and you're like,\n\n05:39.880 --> 05:42.960\n well, how does he get this like crank wacko\n\n05:42.960 --> 05:45.280\n to basically believe he's like the second coming,\n\n05:45.280 --> 05:46.640\n help him write this book?\n\n05:46.640 --> 05:49.400\n I mean, literally, they live together in the prison cell\n\n05:49.400 --> 05:50.460\n and they wake up every day.\n\n05:50.460 --> 05:52.440\n And as he was composing Mein Kampf\n\n05:52.440 --> 05:54.760\n and because of the Beer Hall Putsch and all that,\n\n05:54.760 --> 05:59.000\n had this like absolute ability to gather people around him.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:00.760\n I think his greatest skill was,\n\n06:00.760 --> 06:03.080\n is he was just a very good politician, truly.\n\n06:03.080 --> 06:05.040\n I mean, if you look at his ability\n\n06:05.040 --> 06:07.600\n in order to read coalitional politics\n\n06:07.600 --> 06:10.360\n and then convince exactly the right people\n\n06:10.360 --> 06:12.040\n in order to follow him.\n\n06:12.040 --> 06:13.360\n I think I heard you ask this once\n\n06:13.360 --> 06:14.480\n and I've thought about it a lot,\n\n06:14.480 --> 06:17.440\n which is like, who could have stopped Hitler in Germany?\n\n06:17.440 --> 06:19.040\n It's always like the ever present question.\n\n06:19.040 --> 06:21.200\n Of course, like the whole baby Hitler thing.\n\n06:21.200 --> 06:22.640\n Really the answer is Hindenburg.\n\n06:22.640 --> 06:25.000\n Like Hindenburg was the person who could have stopped\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.980\n and had the immense standing within the German public.\n\n06:27.980 --> 06:30.880\n The only real like war hero\n\n06:30.880 --> 06:34.720\n definitely was personally skeptical of fascism and Nazism.\n\n06:34.720 --> 06:35.760\n And didn't like Hitler.\n\n06:35.760 --> 06:38.240\n And didn't like him and he knew he was full of shit.\n\n06:38.240 --> 06:40.160\n He was like, yeah, I think this guy is dangerous.\n\n06:40.160 --> 06:43.680\n I think this guy could do a lot of damage to the Republic.\n\n06:43.680 --> 06:46.960\n But he acceded basically to Hitler at the time.\n\n06:46.960 --> 06:48.760\n And I think that he was one of the main people\n\n06:48.760 --> 06:50.160\n who could have done something about it.\n\n06:50.160 --> 06:53.760\n And also he was able to convince the generals, the military.\n\n06:53.760 --> 06:56.600\n I mean, that was very interesting.\n\n06:56.600 --> 07:01.520\n And to convince Chamberlain and the other political leaders.\n\n07:01.520 --> 07:04.180\n That's something I often think about\n\n07:04.180 --> 07:06.700\n because we're just reading books about these people.\n\n07:06.700 --> 07:09.040\n I think about what like Jeffrey Epstein, for example.\n\n07:09.040 --> 07:12.480\n Like evil people, not evil,\n\n07:12.480 --> 07:14.160\n but people have done evil things.\n\n07:14.160 --> 07:17.720\n Let's not go to the Dan Carlin thing of what is evil.\n\n07:19.720 --> 07:21.440\n People that do evil things,\n\n07:21.440 --> 07:23.300\n I wonder what they are like in a room\n\n07:23.300 --> 07:25.800\n because I know quite a lot of intelligent people\n\n07:25.800 --> 07:30.800\n that did not see the evil in Jeffrey Epstein\n\n07:33.720 --> 07:35.040\n and spend time with them.\n\n07:35.040 --> 07:37.040\n And were not bothered by it.\n\n07:37.040 --> 07:40.360\n In the same sense, Hitler,\n\n07:40.360 --> 07:43.080\n it seems like he was able to get,\n\n07:43.080 --> 07:45.920\n just even before he had power,\n\n07:45.920 --> 07:48.520\n because people get intoxicated by power and so on.\n\n07:48.520 --> 07:49.680\n They want to be close to power.\n\n07:49.680 --> 07:51.120\n But even before he had power,\n\n07:51.120 --> 07:52.700\n he was able to convince people.\n\n07:53.640 --> 07:55.360\n And it's unclear,\n\n07:55.360 --> 07:58.880\n like is there something that's more than words?\n\n07:58.880 --> 08:01.140\n It's like the way you,\n\n08:01.140 --> 08:04.560\n I mean, people talk, tell stories about like this piercing\n\n08:04.560 --> 08:06.760\n look and whatever, all that kind of stuff.\n\n08:06.760 --> 08:10.240\n I wonder if that's somehow a part of it.\n\n08:10.240 --> 08:12.600\n Like that has to be the base floor\n\n08:12.600 --> 08:14.600\n of any of these charismatic leaders.\n\n08:14.600 --> 08:17.800\n You have to be able to, in a room alone,\n\n08:17.800 --> 08:20.280\n be able to convince anybody of anything.\n\n08:20.280 --> 08:23.120\n So I can tell you from my personal experience,\n\n08:23.120 --> 08:26.480\n one of the best educated lessons I got\n\n08:26.480 --> 08:29.360\n was when I got to meet Trump.\n\n08:29.360 --> 08:32.480\n So I interviewed Trump four different times as a journalist,\n\n08:32.480 --> 08:36.320\n spent like two and a half hours with him in the Oval Office,\n\n08:36.320 --> 08:38.820\n not alone, but like me and one person\n\n08:38.820 --> 08:40.660\n and like the press secretary, and that was it.\n\n08:40.660 --> 08:42.480\n So I actually got to observe him.\n\n08:42.480 --> 08:45.320\n And as a guy who reads these types of books,\n\n08:45.320 --> 08:48.340\n and you think of Trump, obviously most people,\n\n08:48.340 --> 08:51.720\n what they see on television, in articles and more,\n\n08:51.720 --> 08:53.960\n but being able to observe it like one on one,\n\n08:53.960 --> 08:57.600\n I was closer to him than I am right now from you.\n\n08:57.600 --> 09:01.540\n That was one of the most educational experiences I got\n\n09:01.540 --> 09:03.140\n because it's like you just said,\n\n09:03.140 --> 09:05.600\n the look, the leaning forward,\n\n09:05.600 --> 09:10.240\n the way he talks, the way he is a master\n\n09:10.240 --> 09:11.920\n at taking the question\n\n09:11.920 --> 09:14.040\n and answering exactly which party wants.\n\n09:14.040 --> 09:15.120\n And then if you try and follow up,\n\n09:15.120 --> 09:18.280\n he's like, excuse me, you know, like he knows.\n\n09:18.280 --> 09:19.600\n And then whenever you're talking,\n\n09:19.600 --> 09:22.240\n it's not that he's annoyed about getting interrupted.\n\n09:22.240 --> 09:24.400\n If he realizes he's been mirandering\n\n09:24.400 --> 09:26.040\n and then you interrupt him, all good.\n\n09:26.040 --> 09:28.320\n But if he's driving home a point,\n\n09:28.320 --> 09:31.160\n which he has to make sure appears in your transcript\n\n09:31.160 --> 09:36.160\n or whatever, it really was fascinating for me to look at.\n\n09:36.320 --> 09:39.040\n And what was also crazy with Trump\n\n09:39.040 --> 09:41.880\n is I realized how much he was living in the moment.\n\n09:41.880 --> 09:44.680\n So when I went to the Oval,\n\n09:44.680 --> 09:46.880\n I've read all these biographies and I walk in,\n\n09:46.880 --> 09:50.800\n I'm like, holy shit, you're like, I'm in the Oval Office.\n\n09:50.800 --> 09:52.280\n Were you interviewing him in the Oval Office?\n\n09:52.280 --> 09:53.920\n In the Oval, every time, I was in the Oval Office.\n\n09:53.920 --> 09:54.760\n You scared shitless?\n\n09:54.760 --> 09:56.600\n Well, I wasn't scared.\n\n09:56.600 --> 09:59.320\n I was just, look, it's the Oval Office, right?\n\n09:59.320 --> 10:01.480\n I mean, I'm this nerd.\n\n10:01.480 --> 10:05.280\n He was like this kid, I'm so, I will admit this here.\n\n10:05.280 --> 10:08.040\n I printed out on my dad's label maker when I was like seven\n\n10:08.040 --> 10:10.000\n and I wrote the Oval Office on my bedroom.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:14.680\n So I was a huge nerd, obviously egomaniacal, even from seven.\n\n10:14.680 --> 10:16.760\n But so for this, I mean, it was huge, right?\n\n10:16.760 --> 10:18.400\n I'm like this 25 year old kid.\n\n10:18.400 --> 10:22.160\n And I walk in there and I see the couch, right?\n\n10:22.160 --> 10:25.240\n And I'm like, oh man, that's Kissinger.\n\n10:25.240 --> 10:28.120\n That's where Kissinger and Nixon got on their knees.\n\n10:28.120 --> 10:29.840\n And then you see over by the door and you're like,\n\n10:29.840 --> 10:31.200\n are the scuff marks still there\n\n10:31.200 --> 10:33.040\n from when Eisenhower used to play golf?\n\n10:33.040 --> 10:34.480\n You know, this is all running through my mind.\n\n10:34.480 --> 10:36.360\n With Trump, none of it was there, none of it, right?\n\n10:36.360 --> 10:39.520\n So like, even the desk, I put my phone on the desk\n\n10:39.520 --> 10:43.320\n to record and I'm like, this is the fucking Resolute desk.\n\n10:43.320 --> 10:46.120\n Like, I shouldn't put my phone on this thing, right?\n\n10:46.120 --> 10:49.120\n And I'm like HMS Resolute, you know, all the international.\n\n10:49.120 --> 10:51.600\n And even for him, he doesn't think about any of it.\n\n10:51.600 --> 10:53.440\n It was like amazing to me.\n\n10:53.440 --> 10:55.440\n Like he had this portrait of Andrew Jackson\n\n10:55.440 --> 10:58.320\n right next to his, to the, I think from on the fireplace,\n\n10:58.320 --> 10:59.840\n like right here on the right.\n\n10:59.840 --> 11:02.500\n And the most revealing question was when I was like,\n\n11:02.500 --> 11:04.440\n Mr. President, what are people gonna remember you for\n\n11:04.440 --> 11:05.480\n in a hundred years?\n\n11:05.480 --> 11:09.120\n And he was like, I don't know, like veteran's choice.\n\n11:09.120 --> 11:11.760\n He like has a list in front of him of like\n\n11:11.760 --> 11:14.120\n his accomplishments, which is staff.\n\n11:14.120 --> 11:17.080\n Yeah, well, I mean, that's what I wanted to know.\n\n11:17.080 --> 11:18.880\n And he's like, veteran's choice.\n\n11:18.880 --> 11:20.440\n And I remember looking at him being like,\n\n11:20.440 --> 11:22.480\n it's not gonna be veteran's choice.\n\n11:22.480 --> 11:25.600\n I'd be like, I'm like, I'm looking at you, Donald Trump,\n\n11:25.600 --> 11:27.840\n the harbinger of something new.\n\n11:27.840 --> 11:29.720\n We still don't know what the hell it is.\n\n11:29.720 --> 11:33.440\n And so I realized with these guys and their charisma\n\n11:33.440 --> 11:35.820\n and more is that they don't think about themselves\n\n11:35.820 --> 11:37.280\n the way that we think about them.\n\n11:37.280 --> 11:38.960\n And that was actually important to understand\n\n11:38.960 --> 11:40.360\n because a lot of people are like,\n\n11:40.360 --> 11:41.720\n Trump is playing all this chess.\n\n11:41.720 --> 11:43.160\n I'm like, I assure you he's not.\n\n11:43.160 --> 11:46.320\n Like he's truly, one time I was interviewing him\n\n11:46.320 --> 11:48.360\n and he had like a certificate that he had to sign\n\n11:48.360 --> 11:49.800\n or something on his desk.\n\n11:49.800 --> 11:51.440\n He's like, it was like child almost.\n\n11:51.440 --> 11:53.600\n Like he got distracted by, he's like, oh, what's this?\n\n11:53.600 --> 11:55.200\n You know, he's just like picking up and I was like,\n\n11:55.200 --> 11:57.720\n wow, like this, this is the guy.\n\n11:57.720 --> 11:59.000\n Like this is what he is.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:02.200\n Well, I wonder if there was a different person\n\n12:02.200 --> 12:05.800\n because you were recording then offline at a party.\n\n12:05.800 --> 12:06.640\n I can tell you.\n\n12:06.640 --> 12:07.460\n Well, here's the thing though,\n\n12:07.460 --> 12:09.320\n because that's another part of it.\n\n12:09.320 --> 12:11.280\n Because that two hours,\n\n12:11.280 --> 12:13.480\n I would say like half of that was not on the record.\n\n12:13.480 --> 12:15.360\n So like, whenever he's off the record,\n\n12:15.360 --> 12:17.960\n he changes completely, right?\n\n12:17.960 --> 12:20.560\n I don't wanna like go into too much of it or whatever,\n\n12:20.560 --> 12:25.560\n but like he, I mean, he is so mindful\n\n12:26.040 --> 12:29.120\n of when that camera is on and when the mic is hot\n\n12:29.120 --> 12:30.840\n in terms of the language that he uses,\n\n12:30.840 --> 12:32.160\n what he's willing to admit,\n\n12:32.160 --> 12:33.680\n what he's willing to talk about,\n\n12:33.680 --> 12:37.560\n how he's willing to even appear in front of his staff.\n\n12:37.560 --> 12:40.160\n I think the most revealing thing Trump ever did\n\n12:40.160 --> 12:41.940\n was there was this press conference,\n\n12:41.940 --> 12:43.640\n like right after he lost the,\n\n12:43.640 --> 12:46.240\n right after the midterm elections in 2018.\n\n12:46.240 --> 12:47.560\n And one of the journalists was like,\n\n12:47.560 --> 12:50.360\n Mr. President, thank you for doing this press conference.\n\n12:50.360 --> 12:51.640\n And he looks at him and he goes,\n\n12:51.640 --> 12:54.160\n it's called earned media, it's worth billions.\n\n12:54.160 --> 12:57.560\n And he just like had so much disdain for him\n\n12:57.560 --> 12:59.320\n because he's like, I'm not doing this for you.\n\n12:59.320 --> 13:00.840\n He's like, I'm doing this for me.\n\n13:00.840 --> 13:03.280\n So he's really aware of the narrative of the story.\n\n13:03.280 --> 13:05.040\n I mean, that the people have talked about\n\n13:05.040 --> 13:08.320\n that all comes from the tabloid media of the,\n\n13:08.320 --> 13:09.640\n from New York and so on.\n\n13:09.640 --> 13:10.840\n He's a master of that.\n\n13:10.840 --> 13:14.140\n But I've also heard stories of just in private,\n\n13:14.140 --> 13:18.140\n he's a really, I don't wanna overuse the word charismatic,\n\n13:18.140 --> 13:21.400\n but just like, he is a really interesting,\n\n13:21.400 --> 13:25.840\n almost like friendly, like a good person.\n\n13:25.840 --> 13:28.040\n Like, that's what I heard.\n\n13:28.040 --> 13:29.720\n I've heard actually surprising the same thing\n\n13:29.720 --> 13:30.840\n about Hillary Clinton.\n\n13:32.320 --> 13:33.160\n And like.\n\n13:33.160 --> 13:35.020\n That I can't tell you anything about.\n\n13:35.020 --> 13:37.720\n But like the way they present themselves\n\n13:37.720 --> 13:40.560\n is perhaps very different than they are\n\n13:40.560 --> 13:42.320\n as human beings and one on one.\n\n13:42.320 --> 13:46.520\n That's something, maybe that's just like a skill thing.\n\n13:46.520 --> 13:50.680\n Maybe the way they present themselves in public\n\n13:50.680 --> 13:55.400\n is actually their, I mean, almost their real self.\n\n13:55.400 --> 13:58.160\n And they're just really good in private,\n\n13:58.160 --> 14:00.960\n one on one to go into this mode\n\n14:00.960 --> 14:03.960\n of just being really intimate in some kind of human way.\n\n14:03.960 --> 14:04.920\n I think that's part of it.\n\n14:04.920 --> 14:06.760\n Because I noticed that with Trump, you know,\n\n14:06.760 --> 14:08.720\n he's like, it's almost like a tour guide.\n\n14:08.720 --> 14:11.240\n It was very like, it's very crazy, right?\n\n14:11.240 --> 14:12.400\n Cause you're like, you're in the Oval.\n\n14:12.400 --> 14:13.720\n I mean, it's his office.\n\n14:13.720 --> 14:15.680\n And he's like, do you guys want anything?\n\n14:15.680 --> 14:16.920\n And he's like, you want a Diet Coke?\n\n14:16.920 --> 14:19.200\n Cause he drinks like all this Diet Coke.\n\n14:19.200 --> 14:20.040\n You know?\n\n14:20.040 --> 14:23.960\n And he's just like, you guys want a Diet Coke, right?\n\n14:23.960 --> 14:26.040\n And you're sitting there and you're like,\n\n14:26.040 --> 14:28.520\n the way he's able to like,\n\n14:28.520 --> 14:30.200\n like the last time I interviewed him,\n\n14:30.200 --> 14:33.240\n he wanted to do it outside.\n\n14:33.240 --> 14:36.300\n Because he like, he's studied himself from all angles.\n\n14:36.300 --> 14:38.520\n And he knows exactly how he looks on a camera\n\n14:38.520 --> 14:39.840\n and with which lighting.\n\n14:39.840 --> 14:42.080\n And so we were supposed to interview him on camera\n\n14:42.080 --> 14:43.980\n in the Oval Office, which is actually rare.\n\n14:43.980 --> 14:45.640\n Like you don't usually get that.\n\n14:45.640 --> 14:48.360\n And they ended up moving it outside at the last minute.\n\n14:48.360 --> 14:49.400\n And he came out and he's like,\n\n14:49.400 --> 14:50.240\n I picked this spot for you.\n\n14:50.240 --> 14:51.360\n He's like, great lighting.\n\n14:51.360 --> 14:52.200\n Yeah.\n\n14:52.200 --> 14:55.240\n I was like, you are your own like lighting director.\n\n14:55.240 --> 14:56.080\n Yeah.\n\n14:56.080 --> 14:56.900\n The president, right?\n\n14:56.900 --> 14:57.740\n It's great.\n\n14:57.740 --> 14:58.920\n It's so funny.\n\n14:58.920 --> 15:02.640\n But it's like you said, he's very charismatic\n\n15:02.640 --> 15:04.240\n and friendly.\n\n15:04.240 --> 15:05.680\n I mean, you wouldn't know.\n\n15:05.680 --> 15:07.000\n I mean, look, this is what I mean\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:10.720\n in terms of the dynamism of these people that gets lost.\n\n15:10.720 --> 15:12.280\n And I think even he knows that.\n\n15:12.280 --> 15:14.200\n Like, I don't think he would want that side of him.\n\n15:14.200 --> 15:16.120\n That I see, you know, that you see in those\n\n15:16.120 --> 15:18.880\n off the record moments and more in order to come out\n\n15:18.880 --> 15:21.040\n because he's very keen about\n\n15:21.040 --> 15:23.360\n how exactly he presents to the public.\n\n15:23.360 --> 15:25.360\n It's like, you know, even his presidential portrait,\n\n15:25.360 --> 15:27.760\n everybody usually smiles and he refused to smile.\n\n15:27.760 --> 15:29.980\n He was like, I want to look like Winston Churchill.\n\n15:29.980 --> 15:31.360\n You know, like even he knew that.\n\n15:31.360 --> 15:34.160\n Do you think he believes that he,\n\n15:34.160 --> 15:38.520\n what he kind of implies that he is one of,\n\n15:38.520 --> 15:41.960\n if not the greatest president in American history?\n\n15:41.960 --> 15:43.380\n Like people kind of laugh at this,\n\n15:43.380 --> 15:45.880\n but there's quite, I mean, there's quite a lot of people,\n\n15:45.880 --> 15:47.340\n first of all, that make the argument\n\n15:47.340 --> 15:50.360\n that he's the greatest president in history.\n\n15:50.360 --> 15:52.440\n Like I've heard this argument being made.\n\n15:53.480 --> 15:55.160\n And I mean, I don't know what the,\n\n15:55.160 --> 15:57.280\n first of all, I don't care.\n\n15:57.280 --> 16:01.200\n Like, you can't make an argument\n\n16:01.200 --> 16:02.680\n that anyone is the greatest.\n\n16:02.680 --> 16:05.600\n That's just, that just, I come from a school\n\n16:05.600 --> 16:08.400\n of like being humble and modest and so on.\n\n16:08.400 --> 16:11.840\n It's like, even Michael, you can't have that conversation.\n\n16:11.840 --> 16:15.680\n Okay, so I like that he's humble enough to say\n\n16:15.680 --> 16:17.840\n like Abraham Lincoln or whatever.\n\n16:17.840 --> 16:18.680\n Like, I don't know.\n\n16:18.680 --> 16:19.880\n He says maybe Lincoln.\n\n16:19.880 --> 16:20.800\n Maybe. Remember that.\n\n16:20.800 --> 16:22.600\n Maybe. He says maybe Lincoln.\n\n16:22.600 --> 16:24.920\n Do you think he actually believes that?\n\n16:24.920 --> 16:29.720\n Or is that something he understands will create news\n\n16:29.720 --> 16:32.600\n and also perhaps more importantly,\n\n16:32.600 --> 16:35.600\n piss off a large number of people?\n\n16:35.600 --> 16:38.840\n Is he almost like a musician masterfully playing\n\n16:38.840 --> 16:41.280\n the emotions of the public?\n\n16:41.280 --> 16:46.280\n Or does he, or, and does he believe\n\n16:46.320 --> 16:47.260\n when he looks in the mirror,\n\n16:47.260 --> 16:49.880\n I'm one of the greatest men in history?\n\n16:49.880 --> 16:51.600\n Combination of all three.\n\n16:51.600 --> 16:52.820\n I do think he believes it.\n\n16:52.820 --> 16:54.680\n And for the reason why is I don't think he knows\n\n16:54.680 --> 16:55.880\n that much about US history.\n\n16:55.880 --> 16:56.960\n I really mean that.\n\n16:56.960 --> 16:58.720\n Like, and that's what I meant whenever I was in there\n\n16:58.720 --> 17:01.180\n and I realized he was just living in the moment.\n\n17:01.180 --> 17:03.720\n I don't think he knew all that much about why.\n\n17:03.720 --> 17:06.320\n I mean, this is why he was elected in many ways, right?\n\n17:06.320 --> 17:08.280\n So I'm not saying this is an orbit,\n\n17:08.280 --> 17:10.600\n like I'm not making a judgment on this.\n\n17:10.600 --> 17:12.920\n I'm just saying, I do think in his mind,\n\n17:12.920 --> 17:15.720\n he does think he was one of the best presidents\n\n17:15.720 --> 17:17.680\n in American history largely because,\n\n17:17.680 --> 17:19.480\n and I encountered this with a lot of people who work for him,\n\n17:19.480 --> 17:21.760\n which is that they didn't really know all that much\n\n17:21.760 --> 17:25.000\n kind of about what came before and all that.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.280\n And it's not necessarily to hold it against them\n\n17:27.280 --> 17:28.600\n because for in many ways,\n\n17:28.600 --> 17:30.480\n that's what they were elected to do\n\n17:30.480 --> 17:32.760\n or elected to be in many ways.\n\n17:32.760 --> 17:35.440\n It's an interesting question whether knowing history,\n\n17:35.440 --> 17:39.480\n being a student of history is productive\n\n17:39.480 --> 17:40.400\n or counterproductive.\n\n17:40.400 --> 17:43.440\n I tend to assume I really respect people\n\n17:43.440 --> 17:46.520\n who are deeply like well read in history,\n\n17:46.520 --> 17:51.200\n like presidents that are almost like history nerds.\n\n17:51.200 --> 17:53.160\n I admire that.\n\n17:53.160 --> 17:56.920\n But maybe that gets in the way of governance.\n\n17:56.920 --> 17:57.760\n I don't know.\n\n17:57.760 --> 18:01.080\n It's not, I'm just sort of playing devil's advocate\n\n18:01.080 --> 18:03.000\n to my own beliefs,\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.480\n but it's possible that focusing on the moment\n\n18:05.480 --> 18:07.680\n and the issues and letting history,\n\n18:07.680 --> 18:09.120\n it's like first principles thinking,\n\n18:09.120 --> 18:12.160\n forget the lessons of the past\n\n18:12.160 --> 18:15.280\n and just focus on common sense reasoning\n\n18:15.280 --> 18:16.800\n through the problems of today.\n\n18:16.800 --> 18:18.360\n Yeah, it's really hard question.\n\n18:18.360 --> 18:19.560\n In terms of the modern era,\n\n18:19.560 --> 18:21.720\n I mean, Obama was a student of history.\n\n18:21.720 --> 18:25.040\n Like he used to have presidential biographers\n\n18:25.040 --> 18:27.000\n and people over and I mean, famously,\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:27.920\n like Robert de Caro,\n\n18:27.920 --> 18:29.720\n one of my favorite presidential biographers,\n\n18:29.720 --> 18:32.240\n he was invited to have dinner with Obama\n\n18:32.240 --> 18:35.000\n and Obama would like pepper some of his,\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.840\n it was interesting because he'd try and justify\n\n18:36.840 --> 18:38.720\n some of the things he didn't do by being like,\n\n18:38.720 --> 18:40.600\n well, if you look at what they had to do\n\n18:40.600 --> 18:42.160\n and what I have to deal with,\n\n18:42.160 --> 18:43.280\n mine's much harder.\n\n18:43.280 --> 18:44.960\n So in that way, I was a little pissed off\n\n18:44.960 --> 18:47.520\n because I'd be like, no, that actually like,\n\n18:47.520 --> 18:50.600\n you're comparing apples to oranges and all that.\n\n18:50.600 --> 18:53.040\n But if you look at Roosevelt,\n\n18:53.040 --> 18:54.640\n Teddy Roosevelt in particular,\n\n18:54.640 --> 18:57.480\n this was, I mean, a voracious reader,\n\n18:57.480 --> 18:59.560\n not of just American history, all history.\n\n18:59.560 --> 19:01.600\n That guy's just such a badass.\n\n19:01.600 --> 19:02.440\n Incredible.\n\n19:03.400 --> 19:07.040\n The only president who willed himself to greatness.\n\n19:07.040 --> 19:08.360\n That's like the amazing thing about him.\n\n19:08.360 --> 19:10.320\n He wasn't tested by a crisis, right?\n\n19:10.320 --> 19:12.640\n Like it wasn't, no, he didn't have a civil war.\n\n19:12.640 --> 19:13.480\n He didn't have World War II.\n\n19:13.480 --> 19:15.080\n He didn't have to found the country, literally,\n\n19:15.080 --> 19:17.680\n or like, didn't have to stave off that,\n\n19:17.680 --> 19:20.720\n or he didn't buy Louisiana Purchase, like all that.\n\n19:20.720 --> 19:25.040\n He literally came into a pretty static country\n\n19:25.040 --> 19:27.760\n and he could have just governed with,\n\n19:27.760 --> 19:30.040\n I mean, he was, the person who came before him\n\n19:30.040 --> 19:33.560\n was assassinated, like he easily could have coasted,\n\n19:33.560 --> 19:37.600\n but he literally willed the country into something more.\n\n19:37.600 --> 19:40.560\n And that's always why I've focused a lot on him too,\n\n19:40.560 --> 19:42.520\n because I'm like, that, in many ways,\n\n19:42.520 --> 19:44.600\n I wouldn't say it's easy to be great during crisis.\n\n19:44.600 --> 19:46.440\n I mean, like look at Trump, right?\n\n19:46.440 --> 19:49.360\n But it can bring out the best within you,\n\n19:49.360 --> 19:51.120\n but it's a whole other level\n\n19:51.120 --> 19:53.120\n to bring out the best within yourself\n\n19:53.120 --> 19:54.840\n just for the sake of doing it.\n\n19:54.840 --> 19:56.360\n That's, I think is really interesting.\n\n19:56.360 --> 19:58.200\n The speeches were amazing.\n\n19:58.200 --> 20:00.240\n I'm also a sucker for great speeches\n\n20:00.240 --> 20:04.360\n because I tend to see the role of the president\n\n20:04.360 --> 20:08.400\n as in part like inspirer in chief,\n\n20:08.400 --> 20:10.600\n sort of to be able to, I mean,\n\n20:10.600 --> 20:12.120\n that's what great leaders do,\n\n20:12.120 --> 20:14.200\n like CEOs of companies and so on,\n\n20:14.200 --> 20:17.080\n establish a vision, a clear vision,\n\n20:17.080 --> 20:19.760\n and like hit that hard.\n\n20:19.760 --> 20:22.360\n But the way you establish the vision isn't just like,\n\n20:23.400 --> 20:24.680\n not to dig at Joe Biden,\n\n20:24.680 --> 20:29.040\n but like sleepy, boring statements.\n\n20:29.040 --> 20:31.240\n You have to sell those statements\n\n20:31.240 --> 20:34.080\n and you have to do it in a way\n\n20:34.080 --> 20:35.520\n where everybody's paying attention.\n\n20:35.520 --> 20:36.960\n Everybody's excited.\n\n20:36.960 --> 20:40.480\n And that, Teddy Roosevelt was definitely one of them.\n\n20:40.480 --> 20:44.000\n Obama was, I think, at least early on,\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:47.680\n I don't know, was incredible at that.\n\n20:47.680 --> 20:49.840\n It does feel that the modern political landscape\n\n20:49.840 --> 20:52.800\n makes it more difficult to be inspirational in a sense\n\n20:52.800 --> 20:55.400\n because everything becomes bickering and division.\n\n20:55.400 --> 20:58.600\n I do want to ask you about Trump.\n\n21:00.320 --> 21:03.840\n So you're now a successful podcaster.\n\n21:03.840 --> 21:07.800\n I've talked to Joe about Trump, Joe Rogan,\n\n21:07.800 --> 21:11.440\n and Joe's not interested in talking to Trump.\n\n21:11.440 --> 21:12.400\n It's just fascinating.\n\n21:12.400 --> 21:14.280\n I try to dig into like why.\n\n21:16.160 --> 21:20.240\n What would you interview Trump on like realignment,\n\n21:20.240 --> 21:24.440\n for example, and do you think it's possible\n\n21:24.440 --> 21:27.640\n to do a two, three hour conversation with him\n\n21:27.640 --> 21:31.160\n where you will get at something like human\n\n21:31.160 --> 21:33.840\n or you get at something, like when we're talking\n\n21:33.840 --> 21:35.960\n about the facade he puts forward,\n\n21:35.960 --> 21:37.960\n do you think you could get past that?\n\n21:37.960 --> 21:39.240\n No, I don't.\n\n21:39.240 --> 21:41.720\n I look, I was a White House correspondent.\n\n21:41.720 --> 21:45.040\n I observed this man very closely.\n\n21:45.040 --> 21:46.320\n I interviewed him.\n\n21:46.320 --> 21:49.360\n I think if that mic is hot, he knows what he's doing.\n\n21:49.360 --> 21:52.040\n He just, he's done this too long, Lex.\n\n21:52.040 --> 21:52.880\n He just knows.\n\n21:52.880 --> 21:54.600\n But do you think he's a different human now\n\n21:54.600 --> 21:56.080\n after the election?\n\n21:56.080 --> 21:56.920\n Do you think that?\n\n21:56.920 --> 21:59.160\n Yeah, not at all.\n\n21:59.160 --> 22:02.800\n I think he's been the same person since 1976.\n\n22:02.800 --> 22:03.720\n I really do.\n\n22:03.720 --> 22:07.120\n Like basically, 1976, I studied Trump a lot\n\n22:07.120 --> 22:10.120\n and I think he's basically been the core\n\n22:10.120 --> 22:12.800\n of who he is and elements of that.\n\n22:12.800 --> 22:14.720\n Ever since he built that, you know,\n\n22:14.720 --> 22:18.640\n the ice rink in Central Park and got that media attention,\n\n22:18.640 --> 22:19.480\n that was it.\n\n22:19.480 --> 22:20.960\n Yeah, he's a fascinating study.\n\n22:20.960 --> 22:24.840\n Still, I feel there's a hope in me\n\n22:24.840 --> 22:28.520\n that there would be a podcast like a Joe Rogan,\n\n22:28.520 --> 22:31.560\n like a long form podcast where it's something could be,\n\n22:31.560 --> 22:33.440\n you know, and you're actually a really good person\n\n22:33.440 --> 22:37.840\n to do that, where you can have a real conversation\n\n22:37.840 --> 22:40.360\n that looks back at the election and reveal something on us.\n\n22:40.360 --> 22:42.840\n But perhaps he's thinking about running again\n\n22:42.840 --> 22:46.280\n and so maybe he'll never let down that guard.\n\n22:46.280 --> 22:48.320\n But like, you know, I just love it when\n\n22:49.640 --> 22:54.640\n there's this switch in people where you start looking back\n\n22:55.480 --> 22:57.840\n at your life and wanting to tell stories.\n\n22:57.840 --> 23:01.280\n Like, you know, trying to extract wisdom\n\n23:01.280 --> 23:03.640\n and like realizing you're in this new phase of life\n\n23:03.640 --> 23:06.320\n where like the battles have all been fought,\n\n23:06.320 --> 23:10.360\n now you're this old, like former warrior\n\n23:10.360 --> 23:12.520\n and now you can tell the stories of that time.\n\n23:12.520 --> 23:14.720\n And it seems like Trump is still at it,\n\n23:14.720 --> 23:16.160\n like the young warrior he is,\n\n23:16.160 --> 23:18.400\n he's not in the mode of telling stories.\n\n23:18.400 --> 23:19.600\n You know what I got from Rogan?\n\n23:19.600 --> 23:22.720\n He's the only president who didn't age well in office.\n\n23:22.720 --> 23:23.720\n It's true, right?\n\n23:23.720 --> 23:25.240\n Like, and this is what I mean,\n\n23:25.240 --> 23:28.640\n because he lives in the moment, like the job actually\n\n23:28.640 --> 23:32.560\n aged Obama, I mean, Bush, same thing, even Clinton.\n\n23:32.560 --> 23:36.400\n Clinton was like fat, it looked miserable by like 2000.\n\n23:36.400 --> 23:39.280\n HW, like, I mean, Reagan, famous, actually, yeah,\n\n23:39.280 --> 23:41.040\n pretty much everybody I think about,\n\n23:42.880 --> 23:44.080\n including John F. Kennedy,\n\n23:44.080 --> 23:45.680\n who got much sicker while in office.\n\n23:45.680 --> 23:49.280\n The job like weighs on you and makes you physically ill.\n\n23:49.280 --> 23:53.080\n Trump was, he's the only person who just didn't happen to.\n\n23:53.080 --> 23:57.000\n He almost gotten stronger and he was one of the most,\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:00.240\n like the climate, there's so many people attacking him,\n\n24:00.240 --> 24:03.160\n so much hatred, so much love and hatred.\n\n24:03.160 --> 24:06.760\n And it was just, I mean, it was whatever it was,\n\n24:06.760 --> 24:10.840\n it was quite masterful and a fascinating study.\n\n24:10.840 --> 24:15.840\n If we stick on Hitler for just a minute,\n\n24:15.920 --> 24:20.000\n what lessons do you take from that time?\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:23.440\n Do you think it's a unique moment in human history,\n\n24:23.440 --> 24:27.840\n that World War II, I mean, both Stalin and Hitler,\n\n24:29.360 --> 24:33.840\n you know, is it something that's just an outlier\n\n24:33.840 --> 24:36.440\n in all of human history in terms of the atrocities,\n\n24:36.440 --> 24:40.800\n or is there lessons to be learned?\n\n24:40.800 --> 24:45.280\n You mentioned offline that you're not just a student\n\n24:45.280 --> 24:47.440\n of the entirety of the history, but you also are fascinated\n\n24:47.440 --> 24:50.600\n by just different like policies and stuff.\n\n24:50.600 --> 24:52.120\n Like, what's the immigration policy?\n\n24:52.120 --> 24:53.520\n What's the policy on science?\n\n24:53.520 --> 24:54.360\n And...\n\n24:54.360 --> 24:55.640\n Third Reich in power, let me plug it,\n\n24:55.640 --> 24:58.480\n by Richard Evans, I think is what it was.\n\n24:58.480 --> 25:00.000\n Cause that actually will tell you,\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:03.000\n like what was it like to live under the Nazi regime\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:04.080\n without the war?\n\n25:05.360 --> 25:08.040\n Yeah, it's a hard question in terms of the lessons\n\n25:08.040 --> 25:08.880\n that we can learn.\n\n25:08.880 --> 25:11.800\n Cause there's a lot, and it's actually been over,\n\n25:11.800 --> 25:13.720\n it's been over indexed almost.\n\n25:13.720 --> 25:15.920\n Everything comes back to Hitler in a conversation.\n\n25:15.920 --> 25:20.920\n So I kind of think of it within Mao, Stalin, and Hitler\n\n25:21.120 --> 25:24.880\n as, I don't wanna say payments for,\n\n25:24.880 --> 25:29.880\n but like the end point payment for the sins\n\n25:30.680 --> 25:34.040\n and the problems of the monarchical system\n\n25:34.040 --> 25:35.680\n that evolve within Europe.\n\n25:35.680 --> 25:38.320\n Basically like 1400 and more.\n\n25:38.320 --> 25:41.280\n I basically think that 1400,\n\n25:41.280 --> 25:45.560\n the wars between France, England, the balance of power,\n\n25:45.560 --> 25:49.400\n eventually World War I, and then serfdom within Russia,\n\n25:49.400 --> 25:52.080\n the Russian revolution that birthed Stalin.\n\n25:52.080 --> 25:55.040\n Same thing, the Kaiser and Imperial Germany\n\n25:55.040 --> 25:58.440\n and this like incredibly crazy system of balance of power\n\n25:58.440 --> 25:59.760\n in World War I.\n\n25:59.760 --> 26:01.680\n And then same thing within China\n\n26:01.680 --> 26:05.440\n in terms of the warring states and then the disintegration,\n\n26:05.440 --> 26:08.480\n the European, you know, this is how they think of it.\n\n26:08.480 --> 26:10.400\n Which is like the century of humiliation\n\n26:10.400 --> 26:12.720\n and they had to have something like this.\n\n26:12.720 --> 26:14.040\n I think of it, I try to think of it\n\n26:14.040 --> 26:15.680\n within the context of that.\n\n26:15.680 --> 26:19.080\n I don't wanna sound like an inevitablist,\n\n26:19.080 --> 26:22.920\n but I think of it as, I like to think about systems,\n\n26:22.920 --> 26:25.160\n especially here in DC, that's where I got into politics,\n\n26:25.160 --> 26:29.400\n which is that you have to understand systems of power\n\n26:29.400 --> 26:33.000\n and the incentives within systems and the disincentives,\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:36.840\n the downside risk of what you're creating\n\n26:36.840 --> 26:41.840\n because that is what leads and creates the behavior\n\n26:42.080 --> 26:43.160\n within that system.\n\n26:43.160 --> 26:45.880\n I was just talking to my girlfriend about this yesterday.\n\n26:45.880 --> 26:47.920\n It's kind of funny, like I read these,\n\n26:47.920 --> 26:50.920\n I'm obsessed with these books by Robert Caro,\n\n26:50.920 --> 26:52.400\n the biographies of Lyndon Johnson.\n\n26:52.400 --> 26:54.200\n He's written like 5,000 pages so far\n\n26:54.200 --> 26:55.440\n and it's still not done.\n\n26:55.440 --> 26:59.280\n Okay, so like these are like books I base my life on.\n\n26:59.280 --> 27:02.640\n And look, these are Washington\n\n27:02.640 --> 27:05.480\n and the story of the post New Deal era and forward.\n\n27:05.480 --> 27:06.760\n Not much has changed.\n\n27:06.760 --> 27:09.000\n Like the Senate is still the Senate.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:10.840\n So many of the same problems with the Senate\n\n27:10.840 --> 27:13.280\n are still there in some cases.\n\n27:13.280 --> 27:14.480\n No, not anymore.\n\n27:14.480 --> 27:16.600\n But for a while, some of the people who were there\n\n27:16.600 --> 27:18.800\n with Johnson are actually still,\n\n27:18.800 --> 27:20.480\n one of them is the president of the United States,\n\n27:20.480 --> 27:21.520\n just a joke.\n\n27:21.520 --> 27:24.560\n And you think about also,\n\n27:24.560 --> 27:26.320\n same with the media relationship, right?\n\n27:26.320 --> 27:27.760\n Like there's this media really,\n\n27:27.760 --> 27:29.260\n they may have come and gone.\n\n27:29.260 --> 27:31.800\n Like the people who were in the media\n\n27:31.800 --> 27:34.920\n and who were cozy with the administration officials,\n\n27:34.920 --> 27:37.240\n I mean, they just recreated themselves.\n\n27:37.240 --> 27:41.000\n It's like an ecosystem which doesn't change.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.240\n And that's why I'm like,\n\n27:43.240 --> 27:46.160\n oh, it's not that was a specific time.\n\n27:46.160 --> 27:47.400\n That's just DC.\n\n27:47.400 --> 27:51.520\n Like that is DC because of the way\n\n27:51.520 --> 27:53.000\n the system is architected.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.560\n It's pretty much been that way since like 1908,\n\n27:55.560 --> 27:58.300\n whenever like Teddy Roosevelt was dining\n\n27:58.300 --> 27:59.920\n with these journalists and he would yell at them.\n\n27:59.920 --> 28:02.560\n And then he would go over to the society house.\n\n28:02.560 --> 28:04.120\n And like in many ways,\n\n28:04.120 --> 28:06.580\n that's now instead of going to Henry Adams's house,\n\n28:06.580 --> 28:10.400\n like the people are congregating in Calorama,\n\n28:10.400 --> 28:12.120\n which is the richest neighborhood here\n\n28:12.120 --> 28:13.280\n at somebody else's house.\n\n28:13.280 --> 28:14.920\n Like it's the same thing.\n\n28:14.920 --> 28:16.520\n So you have to think about the system\n\n28:16.520 --> 28:18.680\n and then the incentives within that system\n\n28:18.680 --> 28:20.520\n about what the outcomes that they're producing.\n\n28:20.520 --> 28:21.840\n If you actually wanna think about\n\n28:21.840 --> 28:23.760\n how can I change this from the outside?\n\n28:23.760 --> 28:25.680\n That's also why it's very difficult to change\n\n28:25.680 --> 28:27.640\n because the system is designed\n\n28:27.640 --> 28:31.020\n in order to produce actually pretty specific outcomes\n\n28:31.020 --> 28:33.800\n that can only be changed in extraordinary times.\n\n28:33.800 --> 28:37.300\n Yeah, and sometimes it's hard to predict\n\n28:37.300 --> 28:41.260\n what kind of outcomes will result from the incentive,\n\n28:41.260 --> 28:42.980\n the system that you create, right?\n\n28:42.980 --> 28:44.420\n In the case, because especially\n\n28:44.420 --> 28:46.180\n when it's novel kind of situations.\n\n28:46.180 --> 28:49.260\n With Trump, he actually created a pretty novel situation.\n\n28:49.260 --> 28:53.580\n And a lot of the things that we've seen\n\n28:53.580 --> 28:56.380\n in the 20th century were very novel systems\n\n28:56.380 --> 28:59.780\n where people were very optimistic about the outcomes, right?\n\n28:59.780 --> 29:02.780\n And then it turned out to not have the results\n\n29:02.780 --> 29:04.080\n that they predicted.\n\n29:04.940 --> 29:06.620\n In terms of things being unchanged\n\n29:06.620 --> 29:08.520\n for the past 100 years and so on,\n\n29:08.520 --> 29:12.060\n can you like Wikipedia style\n\n29:12.060 --> 29:14.700\n or maybe like in a musical form,\n\n29:14.700 --> 29:17.100\n like I'm only a bill, describe to me.\n\n29:17.100 --> 29:20.700\n I still sing that to my head sometimes.\n\n29:20.700 --> 29:21.940\n I'm just a bill.\n\n29:25.780 --> 29:27.180\n I don't know what the rest of the song is,\n\n29:27.180 --> 29:30.860\n but let's leave that to people's imagination.\n\n29:30.860 --> 29:33.020\n How does this whole thing work?\n\n29:33.020 --> 29:35.020\n How does the US political system work?\n\n29:35.020 --> 29:37.660\n The three branches is how do you think\n\n29:37.660 --> 29:40.740\n about the system we have now?\n\n29:40.740 --> 29:42.500\n If you were to try to describe,\n\n29:42.500 --> 29:46.320\n if aliens showed up and asked you like,\n\n29:46.320 --> 29:49.740\n they didn't have time, so this is an elevator thing.\n\n29:49.740 --> 29:54.740\n Should we destroy you as you plead to avoid destruction?\n\n29:55.580 --> 29:58.660\n Well, how would you describe how this thing works?\n\n29:58.660 --> 30:02.060\n I would say we come together and we pick the people\n\n30:02.060 --> 30:03.740\n who make our laws.\n\n30:03.740 --> 30:07.900\n Then we pick the guy who executes those laws\n\n30:07.900 --> 30:11.380\n and they together pick the people who determine\n\n30:11.380 --> 30:14.900\n whether they or the president is breaking the law\n\n30:14.900 --> 30:16.380\n at the most basic level.\n\n30:16.380 --> 30:17.780\n That's how I would describe it.\n\n30:20.140 --> 30:22.660\n So the people who make the laws are Congress.\n\n30:22.660 --> 30:27.660\n The executive is charged with executing the laws\n\n30:27.660 --> 30:29.240\n as passed by Congress, the system,\n\n30:29.240 --> 30:30.280\n the branches of government,\n\n30:30.280 --> 30:33.160\n and the Supreme Court is picked by the president,\n\n30:33.160 --> 30:34.400\n confirmed by the Senate,\n\n30:34.400 --> 30:38.200\n which then decides whether you or other people\n\n30:38.200 --> 30:41.960\n are breaking the law in terms of interpretation of that law.\n\n30:41.960 --> 30:42.800\n That's basically it.\n\n30:42.800 --> 30:47.800\n Oh, and they decide whether those laws are in,\n\n30:48.940 --> 30:53.940\n they fall within the restrictions\n\n30:53.940 --> 30:58.820\n and the want of the founders as expressed\n\n30:58.820 --> 31:00.780\n by the Constitution of the United States,\n\n31:00.780 --> 31:05.780\n which is a set of principles that we came together in 1787.\n\n31:06.040 --> 31:09.620\n I want to make sure I get this right, 1787,\n\n31:09.620 --> 31:12.780\n and decided that we were going to live the rest of our lives\n\n31:12.780 --> 31:14.700\n barring a revolution and more.\n\n31:14.700 --> 31:16.860\n And we've made it 200 and something years\n\n31:16.860 --> 31:18.620\n in order on under that system.\n\n31:18.620 --> 31:20.380\n So there's a balance of power\n\n31:20.380 --> 31:22.420\n that's because it's multiple branches.\n\n31:22.420 --> 31:24.900\n There's a tension and a balance to it\n\n31:24.900 --> 31:26.940\n as designed by those original documents.\n\n31:28.260 --> 31:30.360\n What, which is the most dysfunctional,\n\n31:30.360 --> 31:32.700\n the branches, which is your favorite?\n\n31:32.700 --> 31:34.860\n Like in terms of talking about systems\n\n31:34.860 --> 31:37.300\n and like what's the greatest of concern\n\n31:37.300 --> 31:41.500\n and what is the greatest source of benefit in your view?\n\n31:41.500 --> 31:42.740\n The presidency, obviously,\n\n31:42.740 --> 31:46.440\n well, the presidency is my favorite to study, obviously,\n\n31:46.440 --> 31:48.340\n because it is the one\n\n31:48.340 --> 31:51.460\n where there's the most subjective variable change\n\n31:51.460 --> 31:53.420\n in terms of the personality involved\n\n31:53.420 --> 31:56.820\n because of so much power imbued within the executive.\n\n31:56.820 --> 31:59.620\n The Senate is actually pretty much the same.\n\n31:59.620 --> 32:02.060\n That's one of the things I love\n\n32:02.060 --> 32:04.860\n about reading about the Senate and histories of the Senate\n\n32:04.860 --> 32:06.240\n is you're like, oh yeah,\n\n32:06.240 --> 32:08.700\n there were always like assholes in the Senate\n\n32:08.700 --> 32:09.980\n who were doing their thing\n\n32:09.980 --> 32:14.980\n and filibustering constantly based upon this or that.\n\n32:15.300 --> 32:18.460\n And then the personalities involved with the Senate\n\n32:18.460 --> 32:23.460\n haven't mattered as much since like pre civil war, right?\n\n32:23.800 --> 32:25.940\n Like pre civil war, you had like Henry Clay\n\n32:25.940 --> 32:29.940\n and then Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun,\n\n32:29.940 --> 32:31.200\n who even in their own way,\n\n32:31.200 --> 32:33.140\n they represented like larger constituencies\n\n32:33.140 --> 32:35.300\n and they crafted these like compromises\n\n32:35.300 --> 32:37.820\n up until the outbreak of the civil war, et cetera.\n\n32:37.820 --> 32:39.100\n But like post since then,\n\n32:39.100 --> 32:42.700\n you don't think about like the Titans within the Senate.\n\n32:42.700 --> 32:44.600\n Most of that is because a lot of the stuff\n\n32:44.600 --> 32:45.620\n that they had power over\n\n32:45.620 --> 32:47.700\n has transferred over to the executive.\n\n32:47.700 --> 32:51.040\n So I'm most interested in really in like power,\n\n32:51.040 --> 32:52.020\n like where it lies.\n\n32:52.020 --> 32:53.720\n It's actually pretty, you know,\n\n32:53.720 --> 32:54.900\n throughout American history,\n\n32:54.900 --> 32:56.940\n much more used to lie with Congress.\n\n32:56.940 --> 33:00.420\n Now it's obviously just so imbued within the executive\n\n33:00.420 --> 33:02.340\n that understanding executive power\n\n33:02.340 --> 33:04.940\n is I think the thing I'm probably most interested in here.\n\n33:04.940 --> 33:06.340\n Do you think at this point,\n\n33:06.340 --> 33:09.340\n the amount of power that the president has is corrupting\n\n33:09.340 --> 33:12.700\n to their ability to lead well?\n\n33:12.700 --> 33:15.140\n Is this, you know, power corrupts,\n\n33:15.140 --> 33:17.340\n absolute power corrupts, absolutely.\n\n33:17.340 --> 33:21.500\n Are we, is there too much power in the presidency?\n\n33:21.500 --> 33:22.540\n There definitely is.\n\n33:22.540 --> 33:24.180\n And part of the problem,\n\n33:24.180 --> 33:28.460\n one of the things I try to make come across to people is\n\n33:28.460 --> 33:29.740\n if you're the president,\n\n33:29.740 --> 33:34.020\n unless you have a hyper intentional view\n\n33:34.020 --> 33:36.740\n of how something must be different in government,\n\n33:36.740 --> 33:37.940\n your view doesn't matter.\n\n33:37.940 --> 33:41.140\n So for example, like if you were Trump,\n\n33:41.140 --> 33:42.100\n let's take Trump even,\n\n33:42.100 --> 33:43.620\n and even in with a pretty intentional view,\n\n33:43.620 --> 33:46.060\n he was like, I'm gonna end the war in Afghanistan\n\n33:46.060 --> 33:47.260\n and Iraq, right?\n\n33:47.260 --> 33:49.460\n And he came in and he gets these generals in.\n\n33:49.460 --> 33:52.380\n He's like, I wanna end the war in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n33:52.380 --> 33:54.740\n Oh, and I wanna withdraw these troops from Syria.\n\n33:54.740 --> 33:56.300\n And they're like, okay, we'll give you,\n\n33:56.300 --> 33:57.260\n give us like six months.\n\n33:57.260 --> 33:58.100\n He's like, okay.\n\n33:58.100 --> 33:58.940\n And this is the thing about Trump.\n\n33:58.940 --> 34:00.580\n He doesn't realize that it's bullshit.\n\n34:00.580 --> 34:01.420\n So they're like, he's like,\n\n34:01.420 --> 34:03.460\n oh, six months seems fun, right?\n\n34:03.460 --> 34:05.900\n So then six months comes and he's like,\n\n34:05.900 --> 34:07.500\n he's like, so, and then he'll announce it.\n\n34:07.500 --> 34:09.300\n He'll be like, and we're getting out of Syria.\n\n34:09.300 --> 34:10.140\n It's great.\n\n34:10.140 --> 34:11.660\n And then the generals freak out.\n\n34:11.660 --> 34:12.700\n They're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n34:12.700 --> 34:13.620\n We don't have a plan for that.\n\n34:13.620 --> 34:15.060\n He's like, but you guys told me six months.\n\n34:15.060 --> 34:16.660\n He's like, I don't know, now we need another six months\n\n34:16.660 --> 34:18.340\n in order to figure this thing out.\n\n34:18.340 --> 34:19.980\n And by that time, now you're midterms.\n\n34:19.980 --> 34:20.820\n So now what?\n\n34:20.820 --> 34:22.100\n Now you gotta run for reelection.\n\n34:22.100 --> 34:24.500\n So more what I mean by that is,\n\n34:24.500 --> 34:25.980\n if you don't have a hyperintentional view\n\n34:25.980 --> 34:27.500\n about how to change foreign policy,\n\n34:27.500 --> 34:28.940\n if you don't have a hyperintentional view\n\n34:28.940 --> 34:31.260\n about how the Department of Commerce should do its job,\n\n34:31.260 --> 34:33.140\n they are just gonna go on autopilot.\n\n34:33.140 --> 34:35.740\n So this is part of the problem.\n\n34:35.740 --> 34:37.220\n When you asked me about the presidency,\n\n34:37.220 --> 34:40.060\n it's not the presidency itself,\n\n34:40.060 --> 34:43.060\n like the president himself, which has become too powerful.\n\n34:43.060 --> 34:46.580\n It's that we have less democratic checks\n\n34:46.580 --> 34:51.500\n on the people and the systems that are on autopilot.\n\n34:51.500 --> 34:55.500\n And I would say that basically since 2008,\n\n34:57.260 --> 35:01.780\n we have voted every single time to disrupt that system,\n\n35:01.780 --> 35:04.260\n except in the case of 2020 with Joe Biden,\n\n35:04.260 --> 35:05.380\n and there are a lot of different reasons\n\n35:05.380 --> 35:06.940\n around why that happened.\n\n35:06.940 --> 35:09.220\n And in every single one of those cases,\n\n35:09.220 --> 35:11.420\n Obama and Trump, they all failed\n\n35:11.420 --> 35:14.940\n in order to radically disrupt that.\n\n35:14.940 --> 35:17.620\n And that just shows you how titanic the task is.\n\n35:17.620 --> 35:19.860\n And I'm using my language precisely\n\n35:19.860 --> 35:21.340\n because I don't wanna be like deep state,\n\n35:21.340 --> 35:22.940\n but obviously there's deep state.\n\n35:22.940 --> 35:26.060\n Deep state, I guess, has conspiratorial intentions to it.\n\n35:26.060 --> 35:29.300\n But so what you're saying is the true power\n\n35:29.300 --> 35:32.740\n currently lies with the autopilot, AKA deep state.\n\n35:32.740 --> 35:36.500\n Well, but see, this is the thing too I wanna make clear,\n\n35:36.500 --> 35:38.660\n because I think people think conspiratorially\n\n35:38.660 --> 35:40.100\n that they're all coming together\n\n35:40.100 --> 35:42.180\n to intentionally do something.\n\n35:42.180 --> 35:43.220\n No, no, no, no.\n\n35:43.220 --> 35:47.420\n They are doing what they know, believe they are right,\n\n35:47.420 --> 35:50.700\n and don't have real democratic checks within that.\n\n35:50.700 --> 35:53.420\n And so now they have entire generations of cultures\n\n35:53.420 --> 35:55.900\n within each of these bureaucracies where they say,\n\n35:55.900 --> 35:59.540\n this is the way that we do things around here.\n\n35:59.540 --> 36:03.820\n And that's the problem, which is that we have a culture\n\n36:03.820 --> 36:06.900\n of within many of these agencies and more.\n\n36:06.900 --> 36:09.020\n I think the best example for this\n\n36:09.020 --> 36:13.900\n would be during the Ukraine gate with Trump and all that,\n\n36:13.900 --> 36:15.220\n with the impeachment.\n\n36:15.220 --> 36:16.540\n I'm not talking about the politics here,\n\n36:16.540 --> 36:18.980\n but the most revealing thing that happened\n\n36:18.980 --> 36:21.940\n was when the whistleblower guy, Alexander Vindman,\n\n36:21.940 --> 36:24.260\n was like, here you have the president\n\n36:24.260 --> 36:27.060\n departing from the policy of the United States.\n\n36:27.060 --> 36:32.060\n And I was like, well, let me educate you, Lieutenant Colonel.\n\n36:32.300 --> 36:34.580\n The president of the United States\n\n36:34.580 --> 36:36.420\n makes American foreign policy.\n\n36:36.420 --> 36:38.260\n But it was a very revealing comment\n\n36:38.260 --> 36:41.260\n because he and all the people\n\n36:41.260 --> 36:44.040\n within national security bureaucracy do think that.\n\n36:44.040 --> 36:46.620\n They're like, this is the policy of the United States.\n\n36:46.620 --> 36:48.140\n We have to do this.\n\n36:48.140 --> 36:49.460\n That's where things get screwy.\n\n36:49.460 --> 36:51.060\n Well, listen, for me personally,\n\n36:51.060 --> 36:53.180\n but also from an engineering perspective,\n\n36:53.180 --> 36:54.740\n I just talked to Jim Keller.\n\n36:54.740 --> 36:58.700\n It's just, this is the kind of bullshit that we all hate\n\n36:58.700 --> 37:02.340\n when you're trying to innovate and design new products.\n\n37:02.340 --> 37:05.860\n So that's what first principles thinking requires.\n\n37:05.860 --> 37:09.020\n It's like, we don't give a shit what was done before.\n\n37:09.020 --> 37:11.620\n The point is, what is the best way to do it?\n\n37:11.620 --> 37:14.940\n And it seems like the current government,\n\n37:14.940 --> 37:16.260\n government in general, probably,\n\n37:16.260 --> 37:18.540\n bureaucracies in general,\n\n37:18.540 --> 37:21.180\n are just really good at being lazy\n\n37:21.180 --> 37:23.500\n without never having those conversations.\n\n37:23.500 --> 37:26.480\n And just, it becomes this momentum thing\n\n37:26.480 --> 37:29.020\n that nobody has the difficult conversations.\n\n37:29.020 --> 37:32.460\n It's become a game within a certain set of constraints\n\n37:32.460 --> 37:34.860\n and they never kind of do revolutionary tasks.\n\n37:34.860 --> 37:37.900\n But you did say that the presidency is power,\n\n37:37.900 --> 37:41.460\n but you're saying that more power than the others,\n\n37:43.060 --> 37:44.720\n but that power has to be coupled\n\n37:44.720 --> 37:46.600\n with focused intentionality.\n\n37:46.600 --> 37:48.460\n You have to keep hammering the thing.\n\n37:48.460 --> 37:51.040\n If you want it done, it has to be done.\n\n37:51.040 --> 37:54.180\n I mean, and you gotta, this is the other part too,\n\n37:54.180 --> 37:57.700\n which is that it's not just that you have to get it done.\n\n37:57.700 --> 38:01.700\n You have to pick the 100 people who you can trust\n\n38:01.700 --> 38:06.660\n to pick 10 people each to actually do what you want.\n\n38:06.660 --> 38:08.780\n One of the most revealing quotes\n\n38:08.780 --> 38:10.620\n is from a guy named Tommy Corcoran.\n\n38:10.620 --> 38:12.980\n He was the top aide to FDR.\n\n38:12.980 --> 38:14.860\n This I'm getting from the Kara books too.\n\n38:14.860 --> 38:17.200\n And he said, what is a government?\n\n38:17.200 --> 38:20.740\n It's not just one guy or even 10 guys.\n\n38:20.740 --> 38:23.300\n Hell, it's a thousand guys.\n\n38:23.300 --> 38:28.180\n And what FDR did is he masterfully picked the right people\n\n38:28.180 --> 38:31.040\n to execute his will through the federal agencies.\n\n38:31.040 --> 38:32.620\n Johnson was the same way.\n\n38:32.620 --> 38:34.700\n He played these people like a fiddle.\n\n38:34.700 --> 38:36.460\n He knew exactly who to pick.\n\n38:36.460 --> 38:38.980\n He knew the system and more.\n\n38:38.980 --> 38:40.740\n Part of the reason that outsiders\n\n38:40.740 --> 38:43.220\n who don't have a lot of experience in Washington\n\n38:43.220 --> 38:45.860\n almost always fail is they don't know who to pick\n\n38:45.860 --> 38:49.140\n or they pick people who say one thing to their face.\n\n38:49.140 --> 38:50.820\n And then when it comes time\n\n38:50.820 --> 38:52.780\n to carry out the president's policy\n\n38:52.780 --> 38:55.300\n in terms of the government, they just don't do it.\n\n38:55.300 --> 38:57.200\n And the president's too, think about this.\n\n38:57.200 --> 38:58.820\n I think some Rahm Emanuel said this.\n\n38:58.820 --> 39:01.720\n He was like, by the time it gets to the president's desk,\n\n39:01.720 --> 39:02.880\n nobody else can solve it.\n\n39:02.880 --> 39:03.720\n It's not easy.\n\n39:03.720 --> 39:05.620\n It's not like a yes or no question.\n\n39:05.620 --> 39:08.740\n It's every single thing that hits the president's desk\n\n39:08.740 --> 39:10.740\n is incredibly hard to do.\n\n39:10.740 --> 39:12.780\n And Obama actually even said,\n\n39:12.780 --> 39:14.020\n and this was a very revealing quote\n\n39:14.020 --> 39:16.480\n about how he thinks about the presidency,\n\n39:16.480 --> 39:19.100\n which is he's like, look, the presidency\n\n39:19.100 --> 39:21.940\n is like one of those super tankers.\n\n39:21.940 --> 39:26.080\n He's like, I can come in and I can take it two degrees left\n\n39:26.080 --> 39:27.380\n and two degrees right.\n\n39:27.380 --> 39:29.660\n In a hundred years, two degrees left,\n\n39:29.660 --> 39:31.820\n that's a whole different trajectory.\n\n39:31.820 --> 39:32.900\n Same thing on the right.\n\n39:32.900 --> 39:36.940\n And he's like, that ultimately is really all you can do.\n\n39:36.940 --> 39:38.720\n I quibble and disagree with that\n\n39:38.720 --> 39:41.460\n in terms of how he could have changed things in 2008,\n\n39:41.460 --> 39:43.620\n but there's a lot of truth to that statement.\n\n39:43.620 --> 39:44.540\n Okay, that's really fascinating.\n\n39:44.540 --> 39:48.740\n You make me realize that actually both Obama and Trump\n\n39:48.740 --> 39:52.140\n are probably playing victim here to the system.\n\n39:52.140 --> 39:55.780\n You're making me think that maybe you can correct me\n\n39:55.780 --> 39:59.240\n that, cause I'm thinking of like Elon Musk,\n\n39:59.240 --> 40:01.500\n whose major success despite everything\n\n40:01.500 --> 40:03.380\n is hiring the right people.\n\n40:03.380 --> 40:04.220\n Exactly.\n\n40:04.220 --> 40:05.940\n And like creating those thousands,\n\n40:05.940 --> 40:08.500\n that structure of a thousand people.\n\n40:08.500 --> 40:11.220\n So maybe a president has power in that\n\n40:11.220 --> 40:12.600\n if they were exceptionally good\n\n40:12.600 --> 40:13.820\n at hiring the right people.\n\n40:13.820 --> 40:15.220\n Personnel is policy, man.\n\n40:15.220 --> 40:16.620\n That's what it comes down to.\n\n40:16.620 --> 40:18.480\n But wouldn't you be able to steer the ship\n\n40:18.480 --> 40:21.300\n way more than two degrees if you hire the right people?\n\n40:21.300 --> 40:23.820\n So like, it's almost like Obama was not good\n\n40:23.820 --> 40:25.220\n at hiring the right people.\n\n40:25.220 --> 40:26.860\n Well, he hired all the Clinton people.\n\n40:26.860 --> 40:27.700\n That's what happened.\n\n40:27.700 --> 40:28.520\n What happened with Trump?\n\n40:28.520 --> 40:29.500\n He hired all the Bush people.\n\n40:29.500 --> 40:31.820\n And then you just sit back and say,\n\n40:31.820 --> 40:33.780\n oh, president can't,\n\n40:33.780 --> 40:36.300\n but that means you're just suck at hiring.\n\n40:36.300 --> 40:37.140\n Correct.\n\n40:37.140 --> 40:38.960\n Yeah, I mean, look, I know it's funny.\n\n40:38.960 --> 40:40.640\n I'm giving you simultaneously\n\n40:40.640 --> 40:42.840\n the nationalist case against Trump\n\n40:42.840 --> 40:45.100\n and the progressive case against Obama.\n\n40:45.100 --> 40:46.220\n The progressive people are like,\n\n40:46.220 --> 40:48.960\n why the fuck are you hiring all these Clinton people\n\n40:48.960 --> 40:51.860\n in order to run the government and just recreate,\n\n40:51.860 --> 40:53.740\n like why are you hiring Larry Summers,\n\n40:53.740 --> 40:56.280\n who was one of the people who worked at all these banks\n\n40:56.280 --> 40:58.300\n and didn't believe that bailouts were gonna be big enough,\n\n40:58.300 --> 41:01.160\n and then to come in in the worst economic crisis\n\n41:01.160 --> 41:02.500\n in modern American history.\n\n41:02.500 --> 41:03.660\n That was 2008.\n\n41:03.660 --> 41:06.480\n And Summers actively lobbied against larger bailouts,\n\n41:06.480 --> 41:09.900\n which had huge implications for working class people\n\n41:09.900 --> 41:12.420\n and pretty much hollowed out America since.\n\n41:12.420 --> 41:14.120\n Okay, from Trump, same thing.\n\n41:14.120 --> 41:15.940\n You're like, I'm gonna drain the swamp.\n\n41:15.940 --> 41:16.780\n And by doing that,\n\n41:16.780 --> 41:20.580\n I'm gonna hire Goldman Sachs's Gary Cohn\n\n41:20.580 --> 41:25.580\n and Steve Mnuchin and all these other absolute bush clowns\n\n41:25.900 --> 41:27.680\n in order to run my White House.\n\n41:27.680 --> 41:29.320\n Well, yeah, no shit.\n\n41:29.320 --> 41:31.120\n The only thing that you accomplished\n\n41:31.120 --> 41:32.740\n in your four years in office\n\n41:32.740 --> 41:35.820\n is passing a massive tax cut for the rich\n\n41:35.820 --> 41:37.300\n and for corporations.\n\n41:37.300 --> 41:38.820\n I wonder how that happened.\n\n41:38.820 --> 41:41.300\n What role does money play in all of this?\n\n41:41.300 --> 41:43.600\n Is money a huge influence in politics,\n\n41:44.620 --> 41:46.420\n super PACs, all that kind of stuff?\n\n41:46.420 --> 41:50.220\n Or is this more just kind of a narrative that we play with\n\n41:50.220 --> 41:52.060\n because from the outsider's perspective,\n\n41:52.060 --> 41:53.540\n it seems to have,\n\n41:53.540 --> 41:55.800\n that seems to be one of the fundamental problems\n\n41:55.800 --> 41:56.820\n with modern politics.\n\n41:56.820 --> 41:58.480\n So I was just having this conversation,\n\n41:58.480 --> 41:59.320\n Marshall and I,\n\n41:59.320 --> 42:01.180\n Marshall Kosloff, my cohost on The Realignment.\n\n42:01.180 --> 42:04.520\n And it's funny because if you do enough research,\n\n42:04.520 --> 42:08.320\n we actually live in the least corrupt age\n\n42:08.320 --> 42:10.840\n in American campaign finance,\n\n42:10.840 --> 42:13.660\n as in it's never been more transparent.\n\n42:13.660 --> 42:18.300\n It's never been more up to the FEC and all of that.\n\n42:18.300 --> 42:20.900\n If you go back and read not even 50 years ago,\n\n42:20.900 --> 42:22.580\n we're talking about Lyndon B. Johnson,\n\n42:22.580 --> 42:26.540\n handing people like literally as he came up in his youth,\n\n42:26.540 --> 42:28.140\n paying people for votes,\n\n42:28.140 --> 42:32.060\n like the boss of the person who like had\n\n42:32.060 --> 42:33.220\n all the Mexican votes,\n\n42:33.220 --> 42:34.100\n like the person who had,\n\n42:34.100 --> 42:35.740\n and he was like giving out briefcases.\n\n42:35.740 --> 42:37.540\n This is like within people's lifetimes\n\n42:37.540 --> 42:38.940\n who are alive in America.\n\n42:38.940 --> 42:40.460\n So that doesn't happen anymore.\n\n42:40.460 --> 42:44.460\n But I don't like to blame everything on money.\n\n42:44.460 --> 42:46.260\n Although I do think money is obviously\n\n42:46.260 --> 42:47.420\n a huge part of the problem.\n\n42:47.420 --> 42:51.780\n I actually look at it in terms of distribution,\n\n42:51.780 --> 42:55.380\n which is that how is money distributed within our society?\n\n42:55.380 --> 42:59.500\n Because I firmly believe that politics,\n\n42:59.500 --> 43:00.740\n this is gonna get complicated,\n\n43:00.740 --> 43:04.460\n but I think politics is mostly downstream from culture.\n\n43:04.460 --> 43:06.820\n And culture, obviously I'm using economics\n\n43:06.820 --> 43:08.340\n because there's obviously a huge interplay there,\n\n43:08.340 --> 43:10.860\n but like in terms of the equitable\n\n43:10.860 --> 43:12.680\n or lack of equitable distribution of money\n\n43:12.680 --> 43:13.800\n within our politics,\n\n43:13.800 --> 43:15.980\n what we're really pissed off about is we're like,\n\n43:15.980 --> 43:18.100\n our politics only seems to work\n\n43:18.100 --> 43:20.100\n for the people who have money.\n\n43:20.100 --> 43:21.980\n I think that's largely true.\n\n43:21.980 --> 43:24.600\n I think that the reason why things worked differently\n\n43:24.600 --> 43:27.700\n in the past is because our economy was structured\n\n43:27.700 --> 43:28.840\n in different ways.\n\n43:28.840 --> 43:31.620\n And there's a reason that our politics today\n\n43:31.620 --> 43:34.340\n are very analogous to the last Gilded Age\n\n43:34.340 --> 43:37.340\n because we had very similar levels\n\n43:37.340 --> 43:40.700\n of economic distribution and cultural problems too\n\n43:40.700 --> 43:41.540\n at the same time.\n\n43:41.540 --> 43:42.360\n I don't wanna erase that.\n\n43:42.360 --> 43:43.600\n Cause I actually think that's what's driving\n\n43:43.600 --> 43:44.980\n all of our politics right now.\n\n43:44.980 --> 43:46.020\n So that's interesting.\n\n43:47.380 --> 43:48.220\n So in that sense,\n\n43:48.220 --> 43:50.260\n the representative government is doing a pretty good job\n\n43:50.260 --> 43:52.260\n of representing the state of culture\n\n43:52.260 --> 43:53.580\n and the people and so on.\n\n43:53.580 --> 43:54.580\n Yeah.\n\n43:54.580 --> 43:58.460\n Can I ask you in terms of the deep state\n\n43:58.460 --> 43:59.860\n and conspiracy theories,\n\n43:59.860 --> 44:02.020\n there's a lot of talk about,\n\n44:02.020 --> 44:04.420\n again, from an outsider's perspective,\n\n44:04.420 --> 44:06.380\n if I were just looking at Twitter,\n\n44:06.380 --> 44:08.980\n it seems that at least 90% of people\n\n44:08.980 --> 44:10.380\n in government are pedophiles.\n\n44:10.380 --> 44:15.180\n 90 to 95%, I'm not sure what that number is.\n\n44:15.180 --> 44:17.940\n If I were to just look at Twitter, honestly, or YouTube,\n\n44:17.940 --> 44:20.620\n I would think most of the world is a pedophile.\n\n44:20.620 --> 44:22.060\n I would almost feel like.\n\n44:22.060 --> 44:22.900\n Right.\n\n44:22.900 --> 44:25.220\n And if you don't fully believe that, you're a pedophile.\n\n44:25.220 --> 44:26.340\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n44:26.340 --> 44:28.220\n I would start to wonder like, wait,\n\n44:28.220 --> 44:31.080\n like what, am I a pedophile too?\n\n44:31.080 --> 44:34.060\n I'm either a communist or a pedophile or both, I guess.\n\n44:35.060 --> 44:36.300\n Yeah, that's gonna be clipped out.\n\n44:36.300 --> 44:37.420\n Thank you, internet.\n\n44:37.420 --> 44:39.420\n Yeah.\n\n44:39.420 --> 44:42.180\n I look forward to your emails.\n\n44:42.180 --> 44:47.180\n But is there any kind of shadow conspiracy theories\n\n44:47.880 --> 44:51.860\n that give you pause or,\n\n44:51.860 --> 44:52.820\n so the flip side,\n\n44:52.820 --> 44:55.860\n the response to a lot of conspiracy theories is like,\n\n44:55.860 --> 44:57.460\n no, the reason this happened\n\n44:57.460 --> 45:01.820\n is because it's a combination of just incompetence.\n\n45:01.820 --> 45:06.400\n So where do you land on some of these conspiracy theories?\n\n45:06.400 --> 45:09.100\n I think most conspiracy theories are wrong.\n\n45:09.100 --> 45:12.940\n Some are true and those are spectacularly true.\n\n45:12.940 --> 45:14.580\n And if that makes sense.\n\n45:14.580 --> 45:15.820\n Yeah.\n\n45:15.820 --> 45:16.740\n And we don't know which ones.\n\n45:16.740 --> 45:17.660\n I don't know which ones.\n\n45:17.660 --> 45:18.580\n That's the problem.\n\n45:18.580 --> 45:21.540\n I think, well, I mean, look, man, I listened to your podcast.\n\n45:21.540 --> 45:25.500\n I think I was a huge nonbeliever in UFOs\n\n45:25.500 --> 45:28.300\n and now I've probably never believed more in UFOs.\n\n45:28.300 --> 45:30.820\n Like I believe in UFOs.\n\n45:30.820 --> 45:32.780\n Like I'm very comfortable being like,\n\n45:32.780 --> 45:34.280\n not only do I believe in UFOs,\n\n45:34.280 --> 45:35.700\n like I think we're probably being visited\n\n45:35.700 --> 45:37.580\n by an alien civilization.\n\n45:37.580 --> 45:39.500\n And if you asked me that three years ago,\n\n45:39.500 --> 45:40.940\n I would have been like, you're out of your fucking mind.\n\n45:40.940 --> 45:42.180\n Like, what are you talking about?\n\n45:42.180 --> 45:43.980\n Well, listen to David Fravor.\n\n45:43.980 --> 45:44.860\n That's all I have to say.\n\n45:44.860 --> 45:45.700\n That's it.\n\n45:45.700 --> 45:49.100\n I have the sense that the government has information\n\n45:49.100 --> 45:50.660\n that hasn't revealed,\n\n45:50.660 --> 45:52.100\n but it's not like they're,\n\n45:52.100 --> 45:53.700\n I don't think they're holding,\n\n45:53.700 --> 45:56.580\n there's like a green guy sitting there in a room.\n\n45:56.580 --> 45:59.740\n They have seen things they don't know what to do with.\n\n45:59.740 --> 46:01.380\n So it's like, they're confused.\n\n46:01.380 --> 46:04.380\n They're afraid of revealing that they don't know.\n\n46:04.380 --> 46:05.900\n That's what I think it is, right?\n\n46:05.900 --> 46:09.100\n It's revealing, yeah, exactly, that they don't know.\n\n46:09.100 --> 46:10.700\n And then in the process,\n\n46:10.700 --> 46:12.340\n there's a lot of fears tied up in that.\n\n46:12.340 --> 46:15.180\n First, looking incompetent in the public eye.\n\n46:15.180 --> 46:17.700\n Nobody wants to be looked that way.\n\n46:17.700 --> 46:20.340\n And the other is like, in revealing it,\n\n46:20.340 --> 46:22.020\n even though they don't know,\n\n46:22.020 --> 46:23.300\n maybe China will figure it out.\n\n46:23.300 --> 46:24.140\n Exactly.\n\n46:24.140 --> 46:26.660\n So like, we don't want China to figure it out first.\n\n46:26.660 --> 46:28.980\n And so all those kinds of things\n\n46:28.980 --> 46:30.580\n result in basically secrecy.\n\n46:30.580 --> 46:33.340\n Then that damages the trust in institutions\n\n46:33.340 --> 46:36.780\n on one of the most fascinating aspects,\n\n46:36.780 --> 46:39.980\n like one of the most fascinating mysteries of humankind\n\n46:39.980 --> 46:43.340\n of is there life, intelligent life,\n\n46:43.340 --> 46:44.780\n out there in the universe?\n\n46:44.780 --> 46:45.660\n So that's one of them.\n\n46:45.660 --> 46:48.660\n But there's other ones, like for me,\n\n46:48.660 --> 46:53.660\n when I first came across actually Alex Jones was 9 11.\n\n46:53.660 --> 46:57.780\n I remember like, cause I was in Chicago.\n\n46:57.780 --> 46:59.220\n I was thinking like, oh shit,\n\n46:59.220 --> 47:01.460\n are they gonna hit Chicago too?\n\n47:01.460 --> 47:02.340\n That's what everybody was thinking.\n\n47:02.340 --> 47:03.180\n Yeah, everybody.\n\n47:03.180 --> 47:05.060\n Everybody was thinking like, what does this mean?\n\n47:05.060 --> 47:05.900\n What scale?\n\n47:05.900 --> 47:07.620\n What, I mean, trying to interpret it.\n\n47:07.620 --> 47:10.620\n And I remember like looking for information desperately,\n\n47:10.620 --> 47:12.340\n like what happened?\n\n47:12.340 --> 47:14.420\n And I remember not being satisfied\n\n47:14.420 --> 47:17.100\n with the quality of reporting\n\n47:17.100 --> 47:18.780\n and figuring out like rigorous,\n\n47:18.780 --> 47:21.420\n like here's exactly what happened.\n\n47:21.420 --> 47:23.620\n And so people like Alex Jones stepped up\n\n47:23.620 --> 47:25.900\n and others that said like,\n\n47:25.900 --> 47:27.900\n there's some shady shit going on.\n\n47:27.900 --> 47:29.580\n And it sure as hell looked like\n\n47:29.580 --> 47:30.860\n there's shady shit going on.\n\n47:30.860 --> 47:31.820\n Yes.\n\n47:31.820 --> 47:34.740\n So like, and I still stand behind the fact\n\n47:34.740 --> 47:36.780\n that it seems like there's not,\n\n47:36.780 --> 47:39.700\n there's not enough, like it wasn't a good job\n\n47:39.700 --> 47:41.220\n of being honest and transparent\n\n47:41.220 --> 47:42.060\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n47:42.060 --> 47:43.340\n Cause it would implicate the Saudis.\n\n47:43.340 --> 47:44.180\n Let's be honest.\n\n47:44.180 --> 47:46.180\n And see, that's my conspiracy theories.\n\n47:46.180 --> 47:48.140\n I'm like, yeah, I think they covered up a lot of stuff\n\n47:48.140 --> 47:49.500\n because they wanted to cover up\n\n47:49.500 --> 47:50.780\n for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\n47:50.780 --> 47:53.460\n Like, I mean, that was a conspiracy theory\n\n47:53.460 --> 47:54.420\n not that long ago.\n\n47:54.420 --> 47:55.300\n I think it's true.\n\n47:55.300 --> 47:57.140\n I mean, I think it's a hundred percent true.\n\n47:57.140 --> 47:59.940\n Yeah, so those kinds of conspiracy theories are interesting.\n\n47:59.940 --> 48:01.740\n I mean, there's other ones for me personally\n\n48:01.740 --> 48:06.100\n that touched the institution that means a lot to me\n\n48:06.100 --> 48:09.700\n is the MIT and, you know, Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n48:09.700 --> 48:10.660\n Yeah, I wanna hear a lot more.\n\n48:10.660 --> 48:12.780\n I wanna hear about, I talk about Epstein a lot.\n\n48:12.780 --> 48:13.660\n So I'm like. Oh, you do?\n\n48:13.660 --> 48:15.700\n Yeah, and he, I was gonna say,\n\n48:15.700 --> 48:17.020\n in terms of conspiracy theory,\n\n48:17.020 --> 48:18.780\n that one changed my outlook.\n\n48:18.780 --> 48:20.860\n Cause I was like, I was like, whoa,\n\n48:20.860 --> 48:24.180\n like you have this dude who convinced\n\n48:24.180 --> 48:26.620\n some of the most successful people on earth\n\n48:26.620 --> 48:29.100\n that he was like some money manager.\n\n48:29.100 --> 48:31.140\n And it looks like it was totally fake.\n\n48:31.140 --> 48:32.260\n Like Leon Black.\n\n48:32.260 --> 48:34.300\n I mean, this is one of the richest men on wall street,\n\n48:34.300 --> 48:36.700\n $9 billion net worth.\n\n48:36.700 --> 48:40.100\n Why is he giving him over a hundred million dollars\n\n48:40.100 --> 48:42.460\n between 2015 and 2019?\n\n48:42.460 --> 48:43.840\n What's going on here?\n\n48:43.840 --> 48:45.300\n Lex Wexner, same thing.\n\n48:45.300 --> 48:46.300\n So yeah, I wanna hear,\n\n48:46.300 --> 48:48.520\n because you know people who met him.\n\n48:48.520 --> 48:50.820\n And the only person I know who met him was Eric Weinstein.\n\n48:50.820 --> 48:52.160\n I've heard his, right.\n\n48:52.160 --> 48:53.000\n Oh boy.\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:56.620\n So I, listen, I'm still in and Eric is fascinating\n\n48:56.620 --> 48:59.780\n and like Eric is full on saying that.\n\n48:59.780 --> 49:01.700\n He was a Mossad or whatever.\n\n49:01.700 --> 49:04.180\n Yeah, there's a front for something,\n\n49:04.180 --> 49:06.020\n something much, much bigger.\n\n49:06.920 --> 49:09.740\n And there's a, whatever his name, Robert Maxwell,\n\n49:09.740 --> 49:12.140\n all the, all those stories,\n\n49:12.140 --> 49:14.100\n like you could dig deeper and deeper\n\n49:14.100 --> 49:17.580\n that Jeffrey's just like the tip of the iceberg.\n\n49:17.580 --> 49:20.700\n I just think he's an exceptionally charismatic,\n\n49:20.700 --> 49:22.820\n listen, this isn't speaking from confidence\n\n49:22.820 --> 49:25.780\n or like deep understanding of the situation,\n\n49:25.780 --> 49:28.420\n but from my speaking with people,\n\n49:28.420 --> 49:33.420\n he just seems like, at least from the side of his influence\n\n49:34.140 --> 49:36.820\n and interaction with researchers,\n\n49:36.820 --> 49:38.340\n he just seems like somebody\n\n49:38.340 --> 49:40.020\n that was exceptionally charismatic\n\n49:41.700 --> 49:44.780\n and actually took interest.\n\n49:44.780 --> 49:49.780\n He was unable to speak about interesting scientific things,\n\n49:49.780 --> 49:51.940\n but he took interest in them.\n\n49:51.940 --> 49:53.940\n So he knew how to stroke the egos\n\n49:53.940 --> 49:56.260\n of a lot of powerful people, like well,\n\n49:56.260 --> 49:58.500\n like in different kinds of ways,\n\n49:58.500 --> 50:01.220\n I suppose I don't know about this\n\n50:01.220 --> 50:04.180\n because I don't have, like if a really,\n\n50:04.180 --> 50:06.020\n okay, this is weird to say,\n\n50:06.020 --> 50:09.660\n but I have an ability,\n\n50:09.660 --> 50:12.740\n okay, I think women are beautiful, I like women,\n\n50:12.740 --> 50:16.300\n but like if like a supermodel came to me or something,\n\n50:16.300 --> 50:19.300\n like I'm able to reason.\n\n50:19.300 --> 50:22.700\n It seems like some people are not able to think clearly\n\n50:22.700 --> 50:25.260\n when there's like an attractive woman in the room.\n\n50:25.260 --> 50:28.300\n And I think that was one of the tools he used\n\n50:28.300 --> 50:29.380\n to manipulate people.\n\n50:29.380 --> 50:30.300\n Interesting.\n\n50:30.300 --> 50:33.620\n I don't know, listen, it's like the pedophile thing.\n\n50:33.620 --> 50:35.900\n I don't know how many people are complete sex addicts,\n\n50:35.900 --> 50:39.700\n but like, it seems like looking out into the world,\n\n50:39.700 --> 50:42.260\n like the Me Too movement have revealed\n\n50:42.260 --> 50:44.700\n that there's a lot of like weird,\n\n50:44.700 --> 50:47.220\n like creepy people out there.\n\n50:47.220 --> 50:50.500\n I don't know, but I think it was just one of the many tools\n\n50:50.500 --> 50:55.500\n that he used to convince people and manipulate people,\n\n50:56.380 --> 51:01.380\n but not in some like evil way,\n\n51:02.140 --> 51:07.020\n but more just really good at the art of conversation\n\n51:07.020 --> 51:09.820\n and just winning people over on the side.\n\n51:10.860 --> 51:13.660\n And then by building through that process,\n\n51:13.660 --> 51:16.100\n building a network of other really powerful people\n\n51:16.100 --> 51:21.100\n and not explicitly, but implicitly having done shady shit\n\n51:22.700 --> 51:26.300\n with powerful people, like building up\n\n51:26.300 --> 51:31.300\n a kind of implied power of like,\n\n51:31.580 --> 51:34.660\n like we did some shady shit together.\n\n51:34.660 --> 51:37.700\n So we're not like, you're gonna help me out\n\n51:37.700 --> 51:39.580\n on this extra thing I need to do now.\n\n51:39.580 --> 51:41.940\n And that builds and builds and builds\n\n51:41.940 --> 51:44.660\n to where you're able to actually control,\n\n51:44.660 --> 51:48.060\n like have quite a lot of power without explicitly having\n\n51:48.060 --> 51:50.100\n like a strategy meeting.\n\n51:50.100 --> 51:54.060\n And I think a single person or yeah,\n\n51:54.060 --> 51:55.900\n I think a single person can do that,\n\n51:55.900 --> 51:58.100\n can start that ball rolling.\n\n51:58.100 --> 52:00.580\n And over time it becomes a group thing,\n\n52:00.580 --> 52:03.660\n like I don't know if Jillian Maxwell was involved\n\n52:03.660 --> 52:07.980\n or others and yeah, over time that becomes almost\n\n52:07.980 --> 52:09.860\n like a really powerful organization\n\n52:09.860 --> 52:14.500\n that wasn't, that's not a front for something much deeper\n\n52:14.500 --> 52:17.060\n and bigger, but it's almost like maybe it's\n\n52:17.060 --> 52:19.500\n cause I love cellular automata, man.\n\n52:19.500 --> 52:22.100\n A system that starts out as a simple thing\n\n52:22.100 --> 52:25.340\n with simple rules can create incredible complexity.\n\n52:25.340 --> 52:29.500\n And so I just think that we're now looking in retrospect,\n\n52:29.500 --> 52:31.700\n it looks like an incredibly complex system\n\n52:31.700 --> 52:35.020\n that's operating, but like, that's just because it's,\n\n52:35.020 --> 52:37.260\n there could be a lot of other Jeffrey Epstein's\n\n52:37.260 --> 52:41.740\n in my perspective that the simple thing just was successful\n\n52:41.740 --> 52:44.300\n early on and builds and builds and builds and builds\n\n52:44.300 --> 52:47.780\n and then there's a creepy shit that like a lot of aspects\n\n52:47.780 --> 52:50.900\n of the system helped it get bigger and bigger\n\n52:50.900 --> 52:52.420\n and more powerful and so on.\n\n52:52.420 --> 52:56.260\n So the final result is, I mean, listen,\n\n52:56.260 --> 53:00.540\n I have a pretty optimistic, I tend to see the good\n\n53:00.540 --> 53:04.180\n in people and so it's been heartbreaking to me in general\n\n53:04.180 --> 53:09.180\n just to see people I look up to not have the level\n\n53:09.620 --> 53:11.980\n of integrity I thought they would\n\n53:11.980 --> 53:15.260\n or like the strength of character, all those kinds of things.\n\n53:15.260 --> 53:20.260\n And it seems like you should be able to see the bullshit\n\n53:20.420 --> 53:22.860\n that is Jeffrey Epstein, like when you meet him.\n\n53:23.820 --> 53:25.740\n We're not talking about like Eric Weinstein,\n\n53:25.740 --> 53:28.620\n like one or two or three or five interactions,\n\n53:28.620 --> 53:31.780\n but like there's people that had like years\n\n53:31.780 --> 53:33.620\n of relationship with him.\n\n53:33.620 --> 53:35.740\n And I don't know, I'm not sure.\n\n53:35.740 --> 53:36.860\n Even after he was convicted.\n\n53:36.860 --> 53:38.100\n After he was convicted.\n\n53:38.100 --> 53:39.660\n That guy always gets me.\n\n53:39.660 --> 53:42.660\n Yeah, there's stories, I mean, I don't need to sort of,\n\n53:44.460 --> 53:49.460\n I honestly believe, okay, here's the open question I have.\n\n53:52.140 --> 53:55.700\n I don't know how many creepy sexual people\n\n53:55.700 --> 53:57.060\n that are out there.\n\n53:57.060 --> 54:00.140\n Like, I don't know if there is like,\n\n54:00.140 --> 54:03.380\n like the people I know, the faculty and so on,\n\n54:03.380 --> 54:05.260\n I don't know if they have like a kink\n\n54:05.260 --> 54:08.260\n that I'm just not aware of that was being leveraged\n\n54:08.260 --> 54:13.260\n because to me, it seems like if not everybody's a pedophile,\n\n54:16.300 --> 54:18.580\n then it's just the art of conversation.\n\n54:18.580 --> 54:21.940\n That is just like the art of just like manipulating people\n\n54:21.940 --> 54:23.820\n by making them feel good\n\n54:23.820 --> 54:25.500\n about like the exciting stuff they're doing.\n\n54:25.500 --> 54:28.540\n Listen, man, academics, people talk about money.\n\n54:28.540 --> 54:30.380\n I don't think academics care about money\n\n54:30.380 --> 54:31.540\n as much as people think.\n\n54:31.540 --> 54:34.700\n What they care about is like somebody,\n\n54:34.700 --> 54:37.820\n they want to be, it's the same thing\n\n54:37.820 --> 54:41.020\n that Instagram models posting their butt pictures,\n\n54:41.020 --> 54:42.660\n is they want to be loved.\n\n54:42.660 --> 54:43.780\n They want attention.\n\n54:43.780 --> 54:44.740\n My parents are professors.\n\n54:44.740 --> 54:45.580\n Yeah, I get it.\n\n54:45.580 --> 54:47.060\n Yeah.\n\n54:47.060 --> 54:49.220\n They, and Jeff Epstein,\n\n54:49.220 --> 54:52.380\n like the money is another way to show attention.\n\n54:52.380 --> 54:54.180\n Right, it's a proxy.\n\n54:54.180 --> 54:55.500\n My work matters.\n\n54:55.500 --> 55:00.500\n And he did that for some of the weirdest,\n\n55:00.740 --> 55:02.660\n most brilliant people.\n\n55:02.660 --> 55:06.140\n I don't want to sort of drop names, but everybody knows them.\n\n55:06.140 --> 55:09.860\n It's like people that are the most interesting academics\n\n55:09.860 --> 55:11.420\n is the one he cared about.\n\n55:11.420 --> 55:15.140\n Like people are thinking about the most difficult questions\n\n55:15.140 --> 55:16.900\n in all of science and all of engineering.\n\n55:16.900 --> 55:21.100\n So those people are, were kind of outcasts in academia\n\n55:21.100 --> 55:23.180\n a little bit because they're doing the weird shit.\n\n55:23.180 --> 55:24.460\n They're the weirdos.\n\n55:24.460 --> 55:26.980\n And he cared about the weirdos and he gave them money.\n\n55:26.980 --> 55:30.860\n And that, you know, that's,\n\n55:30.860 --> 55:33.980\n I don't know if there's something more nefarious than that.\n\n55:33.980 --> 55:36.620\n I hope not, but maybe I'm surprised.\n\n55:36.620 --> 55:39.620\n And in fact, half the population of the world is pedophiles.\n\n55:39.620 --> 55:41.340\n No, I think it's what you were talking about,\n\n55:41.340 --> 55:44.220\n which is that it's the,\n\n55:44.220 --> 55:46.780\n it's the implication after the initial, right?\n\n55:46.780 --> 55:48.740\n Like you do some shady things together\n\n55:48.740 --> 55:51.220\n or you do something that you want out of the public eye\n\n55:51.220 --> 55:52.420\n and you're a public person.\n\n55:52.420 --> 55:54.300\n And look, we probably even experienced this\n\n55:54.300 --> 55:55.420\n to a limited extent, right?\n\n55:55.420 --> 55:57.580\n You're like, ah, you know, like, I don't want to,\n\n55:57.580 --> 55:59.340\n I don't know, I almost lost my temper, you know,\n\n55:59.340 --> 56:00.880\n one time whenever a car hit me and I'm like,\n\n56:00.880 --> 56:02.420\n I can't freak out in public anymore.\n\n56:02.420 --> 56:04.580\n Like, you know, like what if somebody takes a photo\n\n56:04.580 --> 56:05.420\n or something?\n\n56:05.420 --> 56:08.260\n And so I think that there's an extent to that\n\n56:08.260 --> 56:10.020\n times a billion, literally,\n\n56:10.020 --> 56:12.220\n when you have a billion dollars or more.\n\n56:12.220 --> 56:13.380\n And you take that all together\n\n56:13.380 --> 56:15.020\n and you stack it up on itself.\n\n56:15.020 --> 56:16.840\n I saw a story about like Bill Clinton.\n\n56:16.840 --> 56:20.340\n Like Bill Clinton was with Epstein or with Ghislaine Maxwell\n\n56:20.340 --> 56:23.020\n in a private air terminal or something.\n\n56:23.020 --> 56:26.460\n And she had one of their like sex, you know,\n\n56:26.460 --> 56:28.140\n one of those girls who was underage,\n\n56:28.140 --> 56:31.140\n had her dressed up in a literal like pilot uniform.\n\n56:31.140 --> 56:33.980\n And she was underage in order to, you know,\n\n56:33.980 --> 56:37.540\n and she was being disguised for being older.\n\n56:37.540 --> 56:39.040\n And she was a masseuse, right?\n\n56:39.040 --> 56:41.620\n Because that was one of the guises which they got\n\n56:41.620 --> 56:43.580\n in order to sexually traffic these women.\n\n56:43.580 --> 56:45.700\n And she was like, Bill was like complaining about his neck.\n\n56:45.700 --> 56:47.740\n And she's like, give Bill Clinton a massage, right?\n\n56:47.740 --> 56:49.420\n So now there's a photo of an underage girl\n\n56:49.420 --> 56:51.340\n giving a massage to the former president\n\n56:51.340 --> 56:52.740\n of the United States.\n\n56:52.740 --> 56:54.640\n I don't think he knew, right?\n\n56:54.640 --> 56:56.680\n But like, that looks bad.\n\n56:56.680 --> 56:59.060\n And so this is kind of what we're getting at,\n\n56:59.060 --> 57:01.020\n which is that you're setting it all up\n\n57:01.020 --> 57:04.100\n and creating those preconditions or like Prince Andrew.\n\n57:04.100 --> 57:05.460\n Do I think Prince Andrew knew\n\n57:05.460 --> 57:08.800\n that Virginia Gouffre was underage?\n\n57:08.800 --> 57:10.060\n I don't know.\n\n57:10.060 --> 57:11.500\n Probably knew she was pretty young,\n\n57:11.500 --> 57:13.100\n which I think is, you know, skeevy enough\n\n57:13.100 --> 57:15.860\n where you're a fucking Prince, you probably know better.\n\n57:15.860 --> 57:18.780\n But I don't think he knew she was underage\n\n57:18.780 --> 57:19.600\n or maybe he did.\n\n57:19.600 --> 57:21.260\n And if he did, then he's even more of a piece of shit\n\n57:21.260 --> 57:22.100\n than I thought.\n\n57:22.100 --> 57:25.620\n But when we look at these things,\n\n57:25.620 --> 57:27.460\n the stuff I'm more interested in is like\n\n57:27.460 --> 57:28.420\n what you were talking about.\n\n57:28.420 --> 57:31.420\n I'm like, Bill Gates, how do you get the richest man\n\n57:31.420 --> 57:33.060\n in the world in your house?\n\n57:33.060 --> 57:35.540\n Like under what, and Gates is like,\n\n57:35.540 --> 57:37.140\n he was talking about financing and all this.\n\n57:37.140 --> 57:40.260\n I'm like, you don't have access to money or bankers?\n\n57:40.260 --> 57:42.740\n Like you're the richest man in the world.\n\n57:42.740 --> 57:46.300\n You can call Goldman Sachs anytime you want on a hotline.\n\n57:46.300 --> 57:49.660\n Like, why do you need, that's where I start again\n\n57:49.660 --> 57:51.700\n to get more conspiratorial because I'm like,\n\n57:51.700 --> 57:54.980\n Bill, dude, you have the gold credit, right?\n\n57:54.980 --> 57:56.660\n Like you don't need Epstein to create\n\n57:56.660 --> 57:59.340\n some complicated financing structure.\n\n57:59.340 --> 58:04.340\n Or Leon Black, like what is 2015, 2009?\n\n58:04.340 --> 58:06.020\n I mean, this is very recent stuff.\n\n58:06.020 --> 58:08.060\n Or, and this is the part that really got me\n\n58:08.060 --> 58:09.740\n as I read the department,\n\n58:09.740 --> 58:11.540\n I think it's called the Department of Financial Service\n\n58:11.540 --> 58:15.580\n report around Deutsche Bank with Epstein.\n\n58:15.580 --> 58:16.900\n They knew he was a criminal.\n\n58:16.900 --> 58:18.620\n They solicited his business,\n\n58:18.620 --> 58:22.100\n explicitly knew that his business meant access\n\n58:22.100 --> 58:24.620\n to other high net worth individuals,\n\n58:24.620 --> 58:27.100\n consistently doled money out from his account\n\n58:27.100 --> 58:31.260\n for hush payments to women in Europe and prostitution rings.\n\n58:31.260 --> 58:33.580\n They knew all of this within the bank.\n\n58:33.580 --> 58:35.580\n It was elevated multiple times.\n\n58:35.580 --> 58:36.620\n Here was the other one.\n\n58:36.620 --> 58:38.260\n One of Epstein's associates was like,\n\n58:38.260 --> 58:40.100\n hey, how much money can we take out\n\n58:40.100 --> 58:42.580\n before we hit the automatic sensor\n\n58:42.580 --> 58:44.820\n before you have to tell the IRS?\n\n58:44.820 --> 58:47.980\n And that question by their own standards\n\n58:47.980 --> 58:51.380\n is supposed to result in a notification to the feds\n\n58:51.380 --> 58:52.340\n and they never did it.\n\n58:52.340 --> 58:54.900\n And he was withdrawing like $2 million of cash\n\n58:54.900 --> 58:58.660\n in five years for tips to, I'm like, okay,\n\n58:58.660 --> 59:00.380\n like something's going on here.\n\n59:00.380 --> 59:01.700\n Like, you see what I'm saying?\n\n59:01.700 --> 59:03.780\n There's a lot of signs that make you think\n\n59:03.780 --> 59:08.100\n that there's a bigger thing at play than just the man,\n\n59:08.100 --> 59:12.940\n that there's some, it does look like a larger organization\n\n59:12.940 --> 59:15.220\n is using this front, right?\n\n59:15.220 --> 59:16.060\n Again, I don't know.\n\n59:16.060 --> 59:17.380\n I truly don't know.\n\n59:17.380 --> 59:19.100\n And I'm not willing to use the certainty,\n\n59:19.100 --> 59:20.580\n which I think a lot of people online are,\n\n59:20.580 --> 59:22.380\n to say like, it wants 100%.\n\n59:22.380 --> 59:23.820\n The certainty is always the problem\n\n59:23.820 --> 59:26.820\n because that's probably why I hesitate\n\n59:26.820 --> 59:28.500\n to touch conspiracy theories\n\n59:28.500 --> 59:31.620\n is because I'm allergic to certainty in all forms.\n\n59:31.620 --> 59:33.380\n In politics, any kind of discourse.\n\n59:33.380 --> 59:37.820\n And people are so sure, in both directions, actually,\n\n59:37.820 --> 59:39.860\n it's kind of hilarious.\n\n59:39.860 --> 59:43.380\n Either they're sure that the conspiracy theory,\n\n59:43.380 --> 59:45.860\n particularly whatever the conspiracy theory is, is false.\n\n59:45.860 --> 59:47.780\n Like they almost dismiss it like,\n\n59:47.780 --> 59:50.860\n like they don't even want to talk about it.\n\n59:50.860 --> 59:51.740\n It's like the people,\n\n59:51.740 --> 59:54.420\n like the way they dismiss that the earth is flat.\n\n59:54.420 --> 59:56.300\n Most scientists are like,\n\n59:56.300 --> 59:59.780\n they don't even want to like hear\n\n59:59.780 --> 1:00:02.300\n what the flat earthers are saying.\n\n1:00:02.300 --> 1:00:05.140\n They don't have like zero patience for it,\n\n1:00:05.140 --> 1:00:09.340\n which is like, maybe in that case is deserved.\n\n1:00:09.340 --> 1:00:14.020\n But everything else, you really like have empathy.\n\n1:00:14.020 --> 1:00:16.260\n Like consider the fact, you have,\n\n1:00:16.260 --> 1:00:18.140\n okay, this is weird to say,\n\n1:00:18.140 --> 1:00:22.140\n but I feel like you have to consider\n\n1:00:22.140 --> 1:00:26.140\n that the earth may be flat for like one minute.\n\n1:00:26.140 --> 1:00:27.700\n Like you have to be empathetic.\n\n1:00:27.700 --> 1:00:29.380\n You have to be open minded.\n\n1:00:29.380 --> 1:00:30.260\n I don't see a lot of that\n\n1:00:30.260 --> 1:00:32.220\n through our cultural taste makers and more.\n\n1:00:32.220 --> 1:00:35.540\n And that really is what concerns me the most.\n\n1:00:35.540 --> 1:00:37.020\n Cause it's just another manifestation\n\n1:00:37.020 --> 1:00:38.140\n of all of our problems.\n\n1:00:38.140 --> 1:00:41.980\n Is that we have this completely bifurcating economy,\n\n1:00:41.980 --> 1:00:44.100\n bifurcating culture, literally,\n\n1:00:44.100 --> 1:00:46.860\n in terms of we have the middle of the country\n\n1:00:46.860 --> 1:00:47.940\n and then we have the coast.\n\n1:00:47.940 --> 1:00:51.340\n And in terms of the population, it's almost 50, 50.\n\n1:00:51.340 --> 1:00:55.220\n And with increasing mega cities and urban culture,\n\n1:00:55.220 --> 1:00:58.820\n like urban monoculture of LA, New York and Chicago\n\n1:00:58.820 --> 1:01:01.380\n and DC and Boston and Austin,\n\n1:01:01.380 --> 1:01:04.100\n relative to how an entire other group\n\n1:01:04.100 --> 1:01:05.980\n of Americans live their lives,\n\n1:01:05.980 --> 1:01:07.380\n or even the people within them\n\n1:01:07.380 --> 1:01:09.140\n who aren't rich and upwardly mobile,\n\n1:01:09.140 --> 1:01:12.060\n how they live their lives is just completely separating.\n\n1:01:12.060 --> 1:01:14.820\n And all of our language and communication\n\n1:01:14.820 --> 1:01:16.940\n in mass media and more is to the top.\n\n1:01:16.940 --> 1:01:18.660\n And then everybody else is forgotten.\n\n1:01:18.660 --> 1:01:21.460\n Do you think when you dig to the core,\n\n1:01:21.460 --> 1:01:25.500\n there is a big gap between left and right?\n\n1:01:25.500 --> 1:01:30.020\n Is that division that's perceived currently real\n\n1:01:30.020 --> 1:01:33.420\n or are most people center left and center right?\n\n1:01:33.420 --> 1:01:34.260\n It's so interesting\n\n1:01:34.260 --> 1:01:37.940\n because that's such a loaded term, center left.\n\n1:01:37.940 --> 1:01:39.060\n What does that mean?\n\n1:01:39.060 --> 1:01:42.900\n Like to you, I think the way you're thinking of it is,\n\n1:01:42.900 --> 1:01:46.140\n I'm not like a, well, even this,\n\n1:01:46.140 --> 1:01:49.260\n like I'm not a radical socialist,\n\n1:01:49.260 --> 1:01:54.260\n but I'm marginally left on cultural issues\n\n1:01:54.660 --> 1:01:56.500\n and economic issues.\n\n1:01:56.500 --> 1:01:59.100\n This is how we've traditionally understood things.\n\n1:01:59.100 --> 1:02:02.020\n And then in popular discourse, like center right,\n\n1:02:02.020 --> 1:02:03.300\n like what does it mean to be center right?\n\n1:02:03.300 --> 1:02:08.300\n Like I am marginally right on social issues\n\n1:02:08.300 --> 1:02:10.780\n and marginally right on economic issues.\n\n1:02:10.780 --> 1:02:14.500\n But that's just not, like if you look at survey data,\n\n1:02:14.500 --> 1:02:18.180\n for example, like stimulus checks,\n\n1:02:18.180 --> 1:02:20.700\n people who are against stimulus checks are conservative.\n\n1:02:20.700 --> 1:02:23.660\n Well, 80% of the population is for a stimulus check.\n\n1:02:23.660 --> 1:02:26.180\n So that means a sizable number of Republicans\n\n1:02:26.180 --> 1:02:27.540\n are for stimulus checks.\n\n1:02:27.540 --> 1:02:29.900\n Same thing happens on like a wealth tax.\n\n1:02:30.780 --> 1:02:35.260\n The same thing happens on, okay, Florida voted for Trump,\n\n1:02:35.260 --> 1:02:39.460\n 3.1%, more than Barack Obama, 2008,\n\n1:02:39.460 --> 1:02:44.020\n on the same day passes a $15 minimum wage at 67%.\n\n1:02:44.020 --> 1:02:45.240\n So what's going on?\n\n1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:46.080\n So that's why I.\n\n1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:47.780\n What is going on?\n\n1:02:47.780 --> 1:02:50.420\n Oh, that's my entire career.\n\n1:02:50.420 --> 1:02:53.620\n But it seems like, so that's fascinating.\n\n1:02:53.620 --> 1:02:57.700\n Conversation is different than the policies.\n\n1:02:57.700 --> 1:02:59.140\n Well, it's different than reality.\n\n1:02:59.140 --> 1:02:59.980\n That's what I would say,\n\n1:02:59.980 --> 1:03:02.260\n which is that the way we have to understand\n\n1:03:02.260 --> 1:03:05.460\n American politics today, it didn't always\n\n1:03:05.460 --> 1:03:09.540\n used to be this way, is it's almost entirely long.\n\n1:03:09.540 --> 1:03:12.780\n Basic, I would say the main divider is,\n\n1:03:12.780 --> 1:03:14.140\n because even when you talk about class,\n\n1:03:14.140 --> 1:03:16.480\n this misses it in terms of socioeconomics,\n\n1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:20.980\n it's around culture, which is that it's basically,\n\n1:03:20.980 --> 1:03:24.200\n if you went to a four year degree granting institution,\n\n1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:25.900\n you are part of one culture.\n\n1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:27.900\n If you didn't, you're part of another.\n\n1:03:27.900 --> 1:03:31.140\n I don't wanna erase the 20% or whatever of people\n\n1:03:31.140 --> 1:03:33.540\n who did go to a college degree who are Republicans\n\n1:03:33.540 --> 1:03:37.060\n or vice versa, et cetera, but I'm saying on average,\n\n1:03:37.060 --> 1:03:39.880\n in terms of the median way that you feel,\n\n1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:43.060\n we're basically bifurcating along those lines.\n\n1:03:43.060 --> 1:03:44.660\n And because people get upset, be like,\n\n1:03:44.660 --> 1:03:47.280\n oh, well, there are rich people who vote for Trump.\n\n1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:50.500\n And I'm like, yeah, but you know who they are?\n\n1:03:50.500 --> 1:03:52.700\n They're like plumbers or something.\n\n1:03:52.700 --> 1:03:55.120\n They're people who make $100,000 a year,\n\n1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:57.140\n but they didn't go to a four year college degree\n\n1:03:57.140 --> 1:04:00.380\n and they might live who are in a place\n\n1:04:00.380 --> 1:04:02.420\n which is not an urban metro area.\n\n1:04:02.420 --> 1:04:05.700\n And then at the same time, you have like a Vox writer\n\n1:04:05.700 --> 1:04:08.020\n who makes like 30 grand,\n\n1:04:08.020 --> 1:04:10.380\n but they have a lot more cultural power\n\n1:04:10.380 --> 1:04:11.700\n than like the plumber.\n\n1:04:11.700 --> 1:04:15.100\n So you have to think about where exactly that line is.\n\n1:04:15.100 --> 1:04:18.460\n And I think in general, that's the way that we're trending.\n\n1:04:18.460 --> 1:04:21.220\n So that's why when I say like, what's going on,\n\n1:04:21.220 --> 1:04:22.060\n are we divided?\n\n1:04:22.060 --> 1:04:24.520\n Yeah, like, but it's not left and right.\n\n1:04:24.520 --> 1:04:26.740\n I mean, like, and that's why I hate these labels.\n\n1:04:26.740 --> 1:04:29.340\n So it's more just red and blue like teams.\n\n1:04:29.340 --> 1:04:31.620\n They're arbitrary teams.\n\n1:04:31.620 --> 1:04:33.660\n So how arbitrary are these teams,\n\n1:04:33.660 --> 1:04:34.500\n I guess is another.\n\n1:04:34.500 --> 1:04:35.700\n Completely arbitrary.\n\n1:04:35.700 --> 1:04:37.780\n So, well, you kind of imply that there's,\n\n1:04:37.780 --> 1:04:41.580\n I don't know if you're sort of in post analyzing the patterns\n\n1:04:41.580 --> 1:04:45.220\n because it seems like there's a network effects\n\n1:04:45.220 --> 1:04:47.500\n of like, you just pick the team red or blue\n\n1:04:48.420 --> 1:04:50.240\n and it might have to do with college.\n\n1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:51.620\n You might have to do all of those things,\n\n1:04:51.620 --> 1:04:54.780\n but like, it seems like it's more about\n\n1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.160\n just the people around you.\n\n1:04:58.160 --> 1:04:59.000\n Correct.\n\n1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.940\n So less than whether you went to college or not.\n\n1:05:01.940 --> 1:05:04.100\n I mean, it's almost like, seems like,\n\n1:05:04.100 --> 1:05:08.380\n it's almost like a weird, like network effects that are hard.\n\n1:05:08.380 --> 1:05:11.540\n There's certain strong patterns you're identifying,\n\n1:05:11.540 --> 1:05:13.120\n but I don't know.\n\n1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:15.860\n It's sad to think that it might be just teams\n\n1:05:15.860 --> 1:05:18.780\n that have nothing to do with what you actually believe.\n\n1:05:18.780 --> 1:05:20.060\n Well, it is, Lex.\n\n1:05:20.060 --> 1:05:22.740\n Look, I mean, I don't want to believe that,\n\n1:05:22.740 --> 1:05:25.860\n but the data points me to this, which especially 2020,\n\n1:05:25.860 --> 1:05:28.080\n I'm one of the people chief among them.\n\n1:05:28.080 --> 1:05:29.380\n I will own up to it here.\n\n1:05:29.380 --> 1:05:33.140\n I was totally wrong about why Trump was elected in 2016.\n\n1:05:33.140 --> 1:05:36.780\n I believed and based a lot of my public commentary beliefs\n\n1:05:36.780 --> 1:05:40.020\n on this, Trump was elected because of a rejection\n\n1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:43.380\n of Hillary Clinton neoliberalism on the back\n\n1:05:43.380 --> 1:05:48.380\n of a pro worker message, which was anti immigration.\n\n1:05:48.500 --> 1:05:51.880\n It was its pillar, but alongside of it was a rejection\n\n1:05:51.880 --> 1:05:56.060\n of free trade with China and generally\n\n1:05:56.060 --> 1:05:58.820\n of the political correctness and globalism,\n\n1:05:58.820 --> 1:06:02.300\n which has been come in through the uniparty\n\n1:06:02.300 --> 1:06:05.580\n and same thing here with the military industrial complex\n\n1:06:05.580 --> 1:06:08.580\n and endless war, he rejected all of that.\n\n1:06:08.580 --> 1:06:10.460\n Wait, what's wrong with that prediction?\n\n1:06:10.460 --> 1:06:11.300\n It's wrong, man.\n\n1:06:11.300 --> 1:06:14.180\n And the reason I know this is that it sounds right.\n\n1:06:14.180 --> 1:06:16.740\n I wish it, I honestly wish it was true,\n\n1:06:16.740 --> 1:06:17.780\n but here's the truth.\n\n1:06:17.780 --> 1:06:22.480\n Trump actually governed largely as a neoliberal Republican\n\n1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:26.580\n who was meaner online and who departed from orthodoxy\n\n1:06:26.580 --> 1:06:27.940\n in some very important ways.\n\n1:06:27.940 --> 1:06:28.780\n Don't get me wrong.\n\n1:06:28.780 --> 1:06:31.380\n I will always support the trade war with China.\n\n1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:33.900\n I will always support not expanding the wars\n\n1:06:33.900 --> 1:06:35.580\n in Afghanistan and in Iraq.\n\n1:06:35.580 --> 1:06:38.260\n I will support him moving the Overton window\n\n1:06:38.260 --> 1:06:40.660\n on a million different things and revealing once\n\n1:06:40.660 --> 1:06:42.780\n and for all that GOP voters don't care\n\n1:06:42.780 --> 1:06:45.620\n about economic orthodoxy necessarily.\n\n1:06:45.620 --> 1:06:47.440\n But here's what they do care about.\n\n1:06:47.440 --> 1:06:50.940\n Trump got more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016,\n\n1:06:50.940 --> 1:06:54.900\n despite not delivering largely for all the Trump people\n\n1:06:54.900 --> 1:06:56.740\n out there on that agenda.\n\n1:06:56.740 --> 1:06:59.740\n He wasn't more pro union, but he won more union votes.\n\n1:06:59.740 --> 1:07:02.560\n He wasn't necessarily more pro worker,\n\n1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:07.020\n but he actually won more votes in Ohio than he did in 2016.\n\n1:07:07.020 --> 1:07:10.840\n And he won more Hispanic votes than despite being\n\n1:07:10.840 --> 1:07:13.840\n all the immigration rhetoric, et cetera.\n\n1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:16.200\n Here's why, it's about the culture,\n\n1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:19.460\n which is that the culture war is so hot\n\n1:07:19.460 --> 1:07:22.940\n that negative partisanship is at such high levels.\n\n1:07:22.940 --> 1:07:26.040\n All of the vote is geared upon what the other guy\n\n1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:26.960\n might do in office.\n\n1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:28.460\n And there's a poll actually just came out\n\n1:07:28.460 --> 1:07:29.700\n by Echelon Insights.\n\n1:07:29.700 --> 1:07:31.760\n Crystal and I were talking about it on Rising,\n\n1:07:31.760 --> 1:07:34.900\n that number one concern amongst Democratic voters\n\n1:07:34.900 --> 1:07:37.780\n is Trump voters, number one concern.\n\n1:07:37.780 --> 1:07:41.340\n Not issues like Trump voters.\n\n1:07:41.340 --> 1:07:43.380\n And number two is white supremacy.\n\n1:07:43.380 --> 1:07:47.060\n And so like, which is basically code for Trump voters.\n\n1:07:47.060 --> 1:07:48.940\n And is the same true for the other side?\n\n1:07:48.940 --> 1:07:50.940\n Also on the right, the number one concern\n\n1:07:50.940 --> 1:07:52.380\n is illegal immigration.\n\n1:07:52.380 --> 1:07:56.780\n And number, I think, three or four or whatever is Antifa,\n\n1:07:56.780 --> 1:07:58.620\n which is code for Democrats.\n\n1:07:58.620 --> 1:08:00.860\n At least on the right is a policy kind of thing.\n\n1:08:00.860 --> 1:08:01.980\n Well, yeah, it's funny.\n\n1:08:01.980 --> 1:08:03.800\n I saw Ben Shapiro was talking about this.\n\n1:08:03.800 --> 1:08:06.720\n But the reason why I would functionally say it's the same\n\n1:08:06.720 --> 1:08:10.260\n is because, I mean, you can believe whether it's true or not.\n\n1:08:10.260 --> 1:08:11.400\n I think it actually largely is true.\n\n1:08:11.400 --> 1:08:15.060\n But a lot of GOP voters feel like a lot of illegal\n\n1:08:15.060 --> 1:08:17.540\n immigration is code for people who are coming in,\n\n1:08:17.540 --> 1:08:19.860\n who are gonna be legalized and are gonna go vote Democrat.\n\n1:08:19.860 --> 1:08:22.740\n Like, I can just explain it from their point of view.\n\n1:08:22.740 --> 1:08:25.220\n So like, what does that actually mean?\n\n1:08:25.220 --> 1:08:27.300\n Each other, like each other,\n\n1:08:27.300 --> 1:08:30.820\n which is that the number one concern is the other person.\n\n1:08:30.820 --> 1:08:33.580\n So negative partisanship has never been higher.\n\n1:08:33.580 --> 1:08:36.260\n And I think people who had my thesis\n\n1:08:36.260 --> 1:08:38.880\n in terms of why Trump was elected in 2016,\n\n1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:39.780\n you have to grapple with this.\n\n1:08:39.780 --> 1:08:43.080\n Like, how did he win 10 million more votes?\n\n1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:45.640\n He came 44,000 votes away from winning the presidency\n\n1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:46.860\n across three states.\n\n1:08:46.860 --> 1:08:50.220\n Like, I don't, none of our popular discourse reflects\n\n1:08:50.220 --> 1:08:51.860\n that very stark reality.\n\n1:08:51.860 --> 1:08:56.860\n And I think so much of it is people really hate liberals.\n\n1:08:57.980 --> 1:08:59.740\n Like, they just really hate them.\n\n1:08:59.740 --> 1:09:04.060\n And I was driving through rural Nevada before the election.\n\n1:09:04.060 --> 1:09:06.380\n And I was like, literally in the middle of nowhere.\n\n1:09:06.380 --> 1:09:08.540\n And there was this massive sign\n\n1:09:08.540 --> 1:09:10.660\n this guy had out in front of his house.\n\n1:09:10.660 --> 1:09:14.380\n And it just said, Trump, colon, fuck your feelings.\n\n1:09:14.380 --> 1:09:16.240\n And I was like, that's it.\n\n1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:18.620\n That is why people voted for Trump.\n\n1:09:18.620 --> 1:09:21.500\n And I don't want to denigrate it because they truly feel\n\n1:09:21.500 --> 1:09:24.500\n they have no cultural power in America,\n\n1:09:24.500 --> 1:09:28.440\n except to raise the middle finger to the elite class\n\n1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:30.540\n by pressing the button for Trump.\n\n1:09:30.540 --> 1:09:31.380\n I get that.\n\n1:09:31.380 --> 1:09:35.020\n That's actually a totally rational way to vote.\n\n1:09:35.020 --> 1:09:37.060\n It's not the way I wish we did vote,\n\n1:09:37.060 --> 1:09:40.140\n but like, you know, that's not my place to say.\n\n1:09:40.140 --> 1:09:41.500\n So this is interesting.\n\n1:09:41.500 --> 1:09:43.260\n If you could just psychoanalyze,\n\n1:09:43.260 --> 1:09:46.620\n I'm again, probably naive about this,\n\n1:09:46.620 --> 1:09:51.620\n but I'm really bothered by the hatred of liberals.\n\n1:09:52.580 --> 1:09:57.580\n It's this amorphous monster that's mocked.\n\n1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:00.980\n It's like the Shapiro liberal tears.\n\n1:10:00.980 --> 1:10:03.180\n And I'm also really bothered by\n\n1:10:05.100 --> 1:10:07.860\n probably more of my colleagues and friends,\n\n1:10:07.860 --> 1:10:09.420\n the hatred of Trump.\n\n1:10:09.420 --> 1:10:14.420\n Yeah, the Trump and white supremacists.\n\n1:10:15.300 --> 1:10:19.580\n So apparently there's 70 million white supremacists,\n\n1:10:19.580 --> 1:10:21.340\n 75 million, sorry.\n\n1:10:21.340 --> 1:10:25.260\n There's millions of white supremacists.\n\n1:10:25.260 --> 1:10:27.600\n And apparently whatever liberal is,\n\n1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:31.860\n I mean, literally liberal has become\n\n1:10:31.860 --> 1:10:33.620\n equivalent to white supremacists\n\n1:10:33.620 --> 1:10:36.620\n in the power of negativity it arouses.\n\n1:10:36.620 --> 1:10:38.020\n I don't even know what those,\n\n1:10:38.020 --> 1:10:41.040\n I mean, honestly, they've become swears essentially.\n\n1:10:42.060 --> 1:10:46.180\n Is that, I mean, how do we get out of this?\n\n1:10:46.180 --> 1:10:49.860\n Because that's why I just don't even say anything\n\n1:10:49.860 --> 1:10:50.960\n about politics online.\n\n1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:53.260\n Cause it's like, really?\n\n1:10:53.260 --> 1:10:57.880\n Like you can't, here's what happens.\n\n1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:01.100\n Anything you say that's like thoughtful,\n\n1:11:01.100 --> 1:11:05.300\n like, hmm, I wonder, immigration, something.\n\n1:11:05.300 --> 1:11:10.300\n I wonder like why we have these many,\n\n1:11:11.540 --> 1:11:13.220\n we allow these many immigrants in\n\n1:11:13.220 --> 1:11:16.140\n or some version of the like thinking through\n\n1:11:16.140 --> 1:11:18.460\n these difficult policies and so on.\n\n1:11:18.460 --> 1:11:22.020\n They immediately tried to find like a single word\n\n1:11:22.020 --> 1:11:24.820\n in something you say that can put you in a bin\n\n1:11:24.820 --> 1:11:28.060\n of liberal or white supremacists\n\n1:11:28.060 --> 1:11:30.180\n and then hammer you to death\n\n1:11:30.180 --> 1:11:32.340\n by saying you're one of the two.\n\n1:11:32.340 --> 1:11:35.000\n And then everybody just piles on happily\n\n1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:39.260\n that we finally nailed this white supremacist or liberal.\n\n1:11:39.260 --> 1:11:42.540\n And that, is this some kind of weird\n\n1:11:42.540 --> 1:11:44.500\n like feature of online communication\n\n1:11:44.500 --> 1:11:45.920\n that we've just stumbled upon?\n\n1:11:45.920 --> 1:11:48.700\n Is there a way or is it possible to argue\n\n1:11:48.700 --> 1:11:51.020\n that this is like a feature, not a bug?\n\n1:11:51.020 --> 1:11:53.360\n Like, this is a good thing?\n\n1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:55.340\n Yeah, well, look, I just think it's a reflection\n\n1:11:55.340 --> 1:11:56.180\n of who we are.\n\n1:11:56.180 --> 1:11:57.500\n People like to blame social media.\n\n1:11:57.500 --> 1:11:59.220\n I think we're just incredibly divided right now.\n\n1:11:59.220 --> 1:12:02.140\n I think we've been divided like this for the last 20 years.\n\n1:12:02.140 --> 1:12:06.140\n And I think that, the reason I focus almost 99%\n\n1:12:06.140 --> 1:12:08.300\n of my public commentary on economics\n\n1:12:08.300 --> 1:12:10.860\n is because you asked an important question at the top.\n\n1:12:10.860 --> 1:12:12.780\n How do we fix this?\n\n1:12:12.780 --> 1:12:14.820\n What did I say about the stimulus checks?\n\n1:12:14.820 --> 1:12:16.980\n Stimulus checks have 80% approval rating.\n\n1:12:16.980 --> 1:12:18.140\n So that's the type of thing.\n\n1:12:18.140 --> 1:12:20.060\n If I was Joe Biden and I wanted to actually\n\n1:12:20.060 --> 1:12:22.020\n heal this country, that's the very first thing\n\n1:12:22.020 --> 1:12:23.860\n I would have done when I came into office.\n\n1:12:23.860 --> 1:12:26.820\n Same thing on when you look at anything\n\n1:12:26.820 --> 1:12:28.940\n that's gonna increase wages.\n\n1:12:28.940 --> 1:12:30.940\n I said on the show, I was like, look,\n\n1:12:30.940 --> 1:12:32.980\n I think Joe Biden will have an 80% approval rating\n\n1:12:32.980 --> 1:12:34.180\n if he does two things.\n\n1:12:34.180 --> 1:12:37.580\n If he gives every American a $2,000 stimulus check\n\n1:12:37.580 --> 1:12:40.080\n and gives everybody who wants a vaccine a vaccine.\n\n1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:40.920\n That's it.\n\n1:12:40.920 --> 1:12:41.740\n It's pretty simple.\n\n1:12:41.740 --> 1:12:43.620\n Cause here's the thing.\n\n1:12:43.620 --> 1:12:45.100\n I don't really like Greg Abbott that much.\n\n1:12:45.100 --> 1:12:46.420\n We have like very different politics.\n\n1:12:46.420 --> 1:12:49.180\n I'm from Texas, but my parents got vaccinated\n\n1:12:49.180 --> 1:12:50.280\n really quickly.\n\n1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:51.620\n That means something to me.\n\n1:12:51.620 --> 1:12:54.180\n I'm like, listen, I don't really care\n\n1:12:54.180 --> 1:12:55.780\n about a lot of the other stuff.\n\n1:12:55.780 --> 1:12:58.200\n He got my family vaccinated.\n\n1:12:58.200 --> 1:13:02.380\n Like that, well, I will forever remember that.\n\n1:13:02.380 --> 1:13:04.940\n And that's how we will remember the checks.\n\n1:13:04.940 --> 1:13:06.580\n This is a part of a reason why Trump\n\n1:13:06.580 --> 1:13:08.380\n almost won the election and why,\n\n1:13:08.380 --> 1:13:10.380\n if the Republicans had been smart enough\n\n1:13:10.380 --> 1:13:13.260\n to give him another round of checks,\n\n1:13:13.260 --> 1:13:14.740\n 100% would have won.\n\n1:13:14.740 --> 1:13:17.100\n Which is that people were like, look,\n\n1:13:17.100 --> 1:13:19.520\n I don't really like Trump, but I got a check\n\n1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:20.760\n with his name on it.\n\n1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:24.260\n And that meant something to me and my family.\n\n1:13:24.260 --> 1:13:26.900\n I'm not saying for all the libertarians out there\n\n1:13:26.900 --> 1:13:29.780\n that they should go and like endlessly spend money\n\n1:13:29.780 --> 1:13:31.020\n and buy votes.\n\n1:13:31.020 --> 1:13:36.020\n What I am saying is lean into the majoritarian positions\n\n1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:40.040\n without adding your culture war bullshit on top of it.\n\n1:13:40.040 --> 1:13:42.660\n So for example, what's the number one concern\n\n1:13:42.660 --> 1:13:45.340\n that AOC says after the first round of checks got out?\n\n1:13:45.340 --> 1:13:47.460\n Oh, the checks didn't go to illegal immigrants.\n\n1:13:47.460 --> 1:13:49.640\n I'm like, are you out of your fucking mind?\n\n1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:51.860\n Like this is the most popular policy America\n\n1:13:51.860 --> 1:13:55.220\n has probably done in 50 years,\n\n1:13:55.220 --> 1:14:00.220\n since like Medicare and you're ruining it.\n\n1:14:00.220 --> 1:14:02.020\n And then on the right is the same thing,\n\n1:14:02.020 --> 1:14:03.540\n which is that they'll be like,\n\n1:14:03.540 --> 1:14:05.940\n these checks are going to like, you know,\n\n1:14:05.940 --> 1:14:07.980\n low level blah, blah, you know,\n\n1:14:07.980 --> 1:14:10.020\n people who are lazy and don't work.\n\n1:14:10.020 --> 1:14:11.140\n I'm like, oh, there you go, you know,\n\n1:14:11.140 --> 1:14:14.340\n like you're just playing a caricature of what you are.\n\n1:14:14.340 --> 1:14:16.340\n Like if you lean into those issues\n\n1:14:16.340 --> 1:14:17.700\n and you got to do it clean,\n\n1:14:17.700 --> 1:14:19.620\n this is what everybody hates about DC,\n\n1:14:19.620 --> 1:14:23.260\n which is that Biden right now is doing the $1,400 checks,\n\n1:14:23.260 --> 1:14:26.140\n but he's looping it in with his COVID relief bill\n\n1:14:26.140 --> 1:14:26.980\n and all that.\n\n1:14:26.980 --> 1:14:28.740\n That's his prerogative, that's the Democrats prerogative.\n\n1:14:28.740 --> 1:14:30.460\n They won the election, that's fine.\n\n1:14:30.460 --> 1:14:33.180\n But I'll tell you what I would have done if I was him,\n\n1:14:33.180 --> 1:14:34.900\n I would have come in and I would have said,\n\n1:14:34.900 --> 1:14:36.340\n there's five United States senators\n\n1:14:36.340 --> 1:14:37.860\n who are on the record, Republicans,\n\n1:14:37.860 --> 1:14:39.860\n who said they'll vote for a $2,000 check.\n\n1:14:39.860 --> 1:14:42.820\n And I would put that on the floor of the United States Senate\n\n1:14:42.820 --> 1:14:46.220\n on my, you know, first or the first day possible.\n\n1:14:46.220 --> 1:14:47.300\n And I would have passed it\n\n1:14:47.300 --> 1:14:49.620\n and I would have forced those Republican senators\n\n1:14:49.620 --> 1:14:52.260\n to live up to that, vote for this bill,\n\n1:14:52.260 --> 1:14:54.740\n come to the Oval Office for a signing\n\n1:14:54.740 --> 1:14:57.300\n so that the very first thing of my presidency\n\n1:14:57.300 --> 1:15:00.700\n was to say, I'm giving you all this relief check,\n\n1:15:00.700 --> 1:15:03.060\n this long national nightmare is over.\n\n1:15:03.060 --> 1:15:05.340\n Take this money, do with it what you need.\n\n1:15:05.340 --> 1:15:07.460\n We've all suffered together.\n\n1:15:07.460 --> 1:15:10.580\n The thing about Biden is he has a portrait of FDR\n\n1:15:10.580 --> 1:15:13.100\n and is in the Oval, which kind of bothers me\n\n1:15:13.100 --> 1:15:16.020\n because he thinks of himself as an FDR like figure.\n\n1:15:16.020 --> 1:15:20.040\n But this is, you have to understand the majesty of FDR.\n\n1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:21.300\n We're talking about a person\n\n1:15:21.300 --> 1:15:23.180\n who passed a piece of legislation\n\n1:15:23.180 --> 1:15:25.340\n five days after he became president.\n\n1:15:25.340 --> 1:15:29.220\n And he passed 15 transformative pieces of legislation\n\n1:15:29.220 --> 1:15:30.860\n in the first 100 days.\n\n1:15:30.860 --> 1:15:35.460\n We're on day like 34, 35, and nothing has passed.\n\n1:15:35.460 --> 1:15:37.660\n The reconciliation bill will eventually become law,\n\n1:15:37.660 --> 1:15:40.100\n but it will become law with no Republican votes.\n\n1:15:40.100 --> 1:15:41.420\n And again, that's fine.\n\n1:15:42.340 --> 1:15:44.900\n But it's not fulfilling that legacy\n\n1:15:44.900 --> 1:15:47.240\n and the urgency of the action.\n\n1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:50.340\n And the mandate, which I believe that history has handed,\n\n1:15:50.340 --> 1:15:52.980\n it handed it to Trump and he fucked it up, right?\n\n1:15:52.980 --> 1:15:54.040\n He totally screwed it up.\n\n1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:55.340\n He could have remade America\n\n1:15:55.340 --> 1:15:57.420\n and made us into the greatest country ever\n\n1:15:57.420 --> 1:15:58.900\n coming out on the other side of this.\n\n1:15:58.900 --> 1:16:01.020\n He decided not to do that.\n\n1:16:01.020 --> 1:16:04.100\n I think Biden was again handed that like a scepter almost.\n\n1:16:04.100 --> 1:16:05.020\n It's like all you have to do,\n\n1:16:05.020 --> 1:16:07.780\n all America wants is for you to raise it up high,\n\n1:16:07.780 --> 1:16:10.540\n but he's keeping it within the realm of traditional politics.\n\n1:16:10.540 --> 1:16:11.620\n I think it's a huge mistake.\n\n1:16:11.620 --> 1:16:13.540\n Why, so this is, everything he's saying\n\n1:16:13.540 --> 1:16:16.280\n is makes perfect sense, like take, okay.\n\n1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:19.420\n It's like, it's like, again, if the aliens showed up,\n\n1:16:19.420 --> 1:16:22.500\n it's like the obvious thing to do is like,\n\n1:16:22.500 --> 1:16:25.100\n what's the popular thing?\n\n1:16:25.100 --> 1:16:28.140\n Like 80% of Americans support this.\n\n1:16:28.140 --> 1:16:30.500\n Like do that clean.\n\n1:16:31.860 --> 1:16:36.380\n Also do it like with like grace,\n\n1:16:36.380 --> 1:16:38.620\n where you're able to bring people together,\n\n1:16:38.620 --> 1:16:40.740\n not like in a political way,\n\n1:16:40.740 --> 1:16:44.620\n but like obvious common sense way.\n\n1:16:44.620 --> 1:16:48.580\n Like just people, the Republicans and Democrats\n\n1:16:48.580 --> 1:16:50.900\n just bring them together on a policy and like bold,\n\n1:16:50.900 --> 1:16:54.240\n just hammer it without the dirt, without the mess,\n\n1:16:54.240 --> 1:16:56.440\n whatever, try to compromise.\n\n1:16:56.440 --> 1:17:00.020\n Just the yellow have a good Twitter account,\n\n1:17:00.020 --> 1:17:03.300\n like loud, very clear.\n\n1:17:03.300 --> 1:17:06.740\n We're gonna give a $2,000 or a stimulus check.\n\n1:17:06.740 --> 1:17:11.060\n Anyone who wants a vaccine gets a vaccine at scale.\n\n1:17:11.060 --> 1:17:14.980\n What make America, let's make America great again\n\n1:17:14.980 --> 1:17:16.620\n by manufacturing.\n\n1:17:16.620 --> 1:17:20.300\n Like we are manufacturing most of the world's vaccine\n\n1:17:20.300 --> 1:17:22.180\n because we're bad motherfuckers.\n\n1:17:22.180 --> 1:17:26.100\n And without maybe with more eloquence than that\n\n1:17:26.100 --> 1:17:27.780\n and just do that.\n\n1:17:27.780 --> 1:17:32.780\n Why haven't we seen that for many, for several presidencies?\n\n1:17:32.780 --> 1:17:34.580\n Because of coalitional politics\n\n1:17:34.580 --> 1:17:36.700\n and they owe something to somebody else.\n\n1:17:36.700 --> 1:17:40.100\n For example, Biden has got a lot\n\n1:17:40.100 --> 1:17:42.900\n of the Democratic constituency has to satisfy\n\n1:17:42.900 --> 1:17:44.520\n within this bill.\n\n1:17:44.520 --> 1:17:47.040\n So there's gonna be a lot of shit that goes in there,\n\n1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:49.220\n state and local aid, all this stuff.\n\n1:17:49.220 --> 1:17:50.540\n Again, I'm not even saying this is bad,\n\n1:17:50.540 --> 1:17:53.900\n but he's like, his theory is, and this isn't wrong,\n\n1:17:53.900 --> 1:17:56.540\n is like we're gonna take the really popular stuff\n\n1:17:56.540 --> 1:18:00.380\n and use it as cover for the more downwardly less popular.\n\n1:18:00.380 --> 1:18:03.580\n And so the Dems could face the accusation,\n\n1:18:03.580 --> 1:18:05.300\n the people who are on this side,\n\n1:18:05.300 --> 1:18:06.220\n this is their pushback to me.\n\n1:18:06.220 --> 1:18:08.940\n They're like, why would we give away the most popular thing\n\n1:18:08.940 --> 1:18:10.920\n in the bill and then we would never be able\n\n1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:13.200\n to pass state and local aid, right?\n\n1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:15.660\n Why would we do, and the Republicans do the same thing,\n\n1:18:15.660 --> 1:18:18.700\n right, like Mitch McConnell, because he's a fucking idiot,\n\n1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:21.740\n decided to say, we're gonna pair these $2,000 stimulus checks\n\n1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:24.020\n with like section 230 repeal.\n\n1:18:24.020 --> 1:18:26.020\n And it was like, oh, it's obviously dead, right?\n\n1:18:26.020 --> 1:18:28.220\n Like it's not gonna happen together.\n\n1:18:28.220 --> 1:18:31.060\n That's largely why I believe Trump lost the election\n\n1:18:31.060 --> 1:18:33.220\n and why those races down in Georgia\n\n1:18:33.220 --> 1:18:34.160\n went the way that they did.\n\n1:18:34.160 --> 1:18:36.860\n Obviously Trump had something to do with it,\n\n1:18:36.860 --> 1:18:39.980\n but the reason why is they have longstanding things\n\n1:18:39.980 --> 1:18:41.160\n that they've wanted to get done.\n\n1:18:41.160 --> 1:18:43.940\n And in the words of Rahm Emanuel, never let a good crisis\n\n1:18:43.940 --> 1:18:47.420\n go to waste and try and get as much as you possibly can done\n\n1:18:47.420 --> 1:18:48.940\n within a single bill.\n\n1:18:48.940 --> 1:18:51.700\n My counter would be this,\n\n1:18:51.700 --> 1:18:53.660\n things have worked this way for too long,\n\n1:18:53.660 --> 1:18:55.820\n which is that the reconciliation bill\n\n1:18:55.820 --> 1:18:59.180\n is almost certainly going to be the only large\n\n1:18:59.180 --> 1:19:02.260\n signature legislative accomplishment\n\n1:19:02.260 --> 1:19:03.680\n of the Biden presidency.\n\n1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:05.380\n That's just how American politics works.\n\n1:19:05.380 --> 1:19:07.900\n Maybe he gets one more, maybe one.\n\n1:19:07.900 --> 1:19:09.980\n He has a second reconciliation bill,\n\n1:19:09.980 --> 1:19:12.860\n then you're running for midterms, it's over.\n\n1:19:12.860 --> 1:19:16.180\n I believe that by trying to change the paradigm\n\n1:19:16.180 --> 1:19:19.820\n of our politics, leaning into exactly what I'm talking here,\n\n1:19:19.820 --> 1:19:23.340\n you could possibly transcend that to a new one.\n\n1:19:23.340 --> 1:19:24.700\n And I'm not naive.\n\n1:19:24.700 --> 1:19:27.220\n I think people respond to political pressures.\n\n1:19:27.220 --> 1:19:30.940\n And the way that we found this out was David Perdue,\n\n1:19:30.940 --> 1:19:35.940\n who was just a total corporate dollar general CEO guy.\n\n1:19:35.940 --> 1:19:39.740\n He was against the original $1,200 stimulus checks.\n\n1:19:39.740 --> 1:19:42.540\n But then Trump came out, who's the single most popular\n\n1:19:42.540 --> 1:19:43.740\n figure in the Republican party.\n\n1:19:43.740 --> 1:19:45.380\n He's like, I want $2,000 stimulus checks.\n\n1:19:45.380 --> 1:19:49.340\n And all of a sudden, Perdue running in Georgia is like,\n\n1:19:49.340 --> 1:19:51.080\n yeah, I'm with President Trump,\n\n1:19:51.080 --> 1:19:53.500\n I want a $2,000 stimulus check.\n\n1:19:53.500 --> 1:19:55.900\n That was, if you're an astute observer of politics,\n\n1:19:55.900 --> 1:19:59.260\n to say, you can see there that you can force people\n\n1:19:59.260 --> 1:20:02.260\n to do the right thing because it's the popular thing.\n\n1:20:02.260 --> 1:20:04.940\n And that if it's clean, if you don't give them\n\n1:20:04.940 --> 1:20:07.740\n any other excuse, they have to do it.\n\n1:20:07.740 --> 1:20:11.580\n So this is what we've been gaslit into our culture war\n\n1:20:11.580 --> 1:20:13.100\n framework of politics.\n\n1:20:13.100 --> 1:20:17.340\n And the reason it feels so broken and awful\n\n1:20:17.340 --> 1:20:20.580\n is because it is, but there is a way out.\n\n1:20:20.580 --> 1:20:23.740\n It's just that nobody wants to be, it's a game of chicken,\n\n1:20:23.740 --> 1:20:24.780\n because maybe it is true.\n\n1:20:24.780 --> 1:20:26.500\n Maybe we would never be able to get\n\n1:20:26.500 --> 1:20:27.840\n your other democratic priorities,\n\n1:20:27.840 --> 1:20:29.320\n your Republican priorities.\n\n1:20:29.320 --> 1:20:31.440\n But I think that the country understands\n\n1:20:31.440 --> 1:20:35.060\n that this is fucking terrible and would be willing\n\n1:20:35.060 --> 1:20:37.100\n to support somebody who does it differently.\n\n1:20:37.100 --> 1:20:41.020\n There's just a lot of disincentives to not stay without,\n\n1:20:41.020 --> 1:20:43.640\n there's a lot of incentives to not stray\n\n1:20:43.640 --> 1:20:44.860\n from the traditional path.\n\n1:20:44.860 --> 1:20:49.540\n Yeah, is it also possible that the A students\n\n1:20:49.540 --> 1:20:51.340\n are not participating?\n\n1:20:51.340 --> 1:20:56.260\n Like we drove all of the superstars away from politics.\n\n1:20:56.260 --> 1:20:58.620\n So like you just had this argument before.\n\n1:20:58.620 --> 1:21:03.620\n I mean, everything you're saying sort of rings true.\n\n1:21:06.260 --> 1:21:08.340\n Like this is the obvious thing to do.\n\n1:21:08.340 --> 1:21:10.820\n As a student of history, you can almost like tell,\n\n1:21:10.820 --> 1:21:14.340\n like, if you look at great people in history,\n\n1:21:14.340 --> 1:21:15.820\n this is what great leaders in history,\n\n1:21:15.820 --> 1:21:17.100\n this is what they did.\n\n1:21:17.100 --> 1:21:22.100\n It's like clean, bold action, sometimes facing crisis,\n\n1:21:23.780 --> 1:21:24.860\n but we're facing a crisis right now.\n\n1:21:24.860 --> 1:21:25.700\n No, we're in a crisis.\n\n1:21:25.700 --> 1:21:27.420\n We've been, exactly.\n\n1:21:27.420 --> 1:21:32.420\n So why don't we see those leaders step up?\n\n1:21:33.460 --> 1:21:36.620\n I mean, you say that's kind of like, it makes sense.\n\n1:21:36.620 --> 1:21:39.220\n There's a lot of different interests at play.\n\n1:21:39.220 --> 1:21:41.800\n You don't wanna risk too many things, so on and so forth.\n\n1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:45.940\n But that sounds like the C students.\n\n1:21:45.940 --> 1:21:47.380\n I don't think it's that.\n\n1:21:47.380 --> 1:21:51.180\n I think it's that the pipeline of politician creation\n\n1:21:51.180 --> 1:21:54.240\n is just totally broken from beginning to end.\n\n1:21:54.240 --> 1:21:59.240\n So it's not that A students don't wanna be politicians.\n\n1:21:59.380 --> 1:22:02.620\n It's basically the way that our current primary system\n\n1:22:02.620 --> 1:22:05.580\n is constructed, is what is the greatest threat to you\n\n1:22:05.580 --> 1:22:07.100\n as a member of Congress?\n\n1:22:07.100 --> 1:22:10.380\n It's not losing your reelection.\n\n1:22:10.380 --> 1:22:13.320\n It's losing your primary, right?\n\n1:22:13.320 --> 1:22:16.180\n So that means, especially in a safe district,\n\n1:22:16.180 --> 1:22:18.200\n you're most concerned about being hit\n\n1:22:18.200 --> 1:22:19.780\n if you're a Republican from the right,\n\n1:22:19.780 --> 1:22:21.380\n and if you're a Democrat from the left\n\n1:22:21.380 --> 1:22:22.820\n for not being a good enough one.\n\n1:22:22.820 --> 1:22:25.580\n That's actually what stops people,\n\n1:22:25.580 --> 1:22:28.580\n heterodox people in particular, from winning primaries\n\n1:22:28.580 --> 1:22:30.740\n because the people who vote in our primaries\n\n1:22:30.740 --> 1:22:32.220\n are the party faithful.\n\n1:22:32.220 --> 1:22:35.140\n That's how you get the production.\n\n1:22:35.140 --> 1:22:37.300\n It's important to understand the production pipeline,\n\n1:22:37.300 --> 1:22:39.700\n which is that, all right, I'm from Texas,\n\n1:22:39.700 --> 1:22:40.700\n so that's what I know best.\n\n1:22:40.700 --> 1:22:43.000\n So it's like, if you think in Texas,\n\n1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:46.100\n if you're a more heterodox like state legislature\n\n1:22:46.100 --> 1:22:49.820\n or something who works with the left on this and does that,\n\n1:22:49.820 --> 1:22:52.640\n you're gonna get your ass beat in a Republican primary\n\n1:22:52.640 --> 1:22:53.480\n because they're gonna be like,\n\n1:22:53.480 --> 1:22:56.780\n he worked with the left to do this, blah, blah,\n\n1:22:56.780 --> 1:22:58.820\n take it out of context, and you're screwed.\n\n1:22:58.820 --> 1:23:01.660\n And then that means you never ascend up\n\n1:23:01.660 --> 1:23:03.260\n the next level of the ladder,\n\n1:23:03.260 --> 1:23:05.580\n and then so on and so forth all the way.\n\n1:23:05.580 --> 1:23:08.260\n But I do think Trump changed everything.\n\n1:23:08.260 --> 1:23:09.860\n This is why I have some hope,\n\n1:23:09.860 --> 1:23:14.860\n which is that he showed me that all the people I listened to\n\n1:23:14.900 --> 1:23:16.820\n were totally wrong about politics,\n\n1:23:16.820 --> 1:23:18.940\n and that's the most valuable lesson you could ever teach me,\n\n1:23:18.940 --> 1:23:20.760\n which was, I was like, wait,\n\n1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:22.380\n I don't really have to listen to these people.\n\n1:23:22.380 --> 1:23:24.940\n I'm like, they don't know anything, actually.\n\n1:23:24.940 --> 1:23:26.020\n That's powerful, man.\n\n1:23:26.020 --> 1:23:27.020\n I'm like, he did it.\n\n1:23:27.020 --> 1:23:28.500\n This guy.\n\n1:23:28.500 --> 1:23:32.460\n Even if he didn't do anything with it.\n\n1:23:32.460 --> 1:23:33.500\n It doesn't matter.\n\n1:23:33.500 --> 1:23:35.740\n He showed that it's possible.\n\n1:23:35.740 --> 1:23:39.580\n And that means a lot.\n\n1:23:39.580 --> 1:23:40.600\n You're absolutely right.\n\n1:23:40.600 --> 1:23:42.080\n There's young people right now\n\n1:23:42.080 --> 1:23:44.860\n that kind of look, turn around and like, huh.\n\n1:23:44.860 --> 1:23:46.820\n You're like, wait, I don't have to comb my hair\n\n1:23:46.820 --> 1:23:50.500\n a certain way and go to law school and be an asshole\n\n1:23:50.500 --> 1:23:52.660\n who everybody knows is an asshole.\n\n1:23:52.660 --> 1:23:55.060\n And then get elected to state legislature.\n\n1:23:55.060 --> 1:23:57.740\n I mean, look, who's the number one person\n\n1:23:57.740 --> 1:24:01.100\n in the New York City primary right now?\n\n1:24:01.100 --> 1:24:02.020\n Andrew Yang.\n\n1:24:02.020 --> 1:24:05.620\n He's polling higher than everybody else in the race.\n\n1:24:05.620 --> 1:24:07.300\n Look, maybe the polls are totally fucked\n\n1:24:07.300 --> 1:24:09.340\n and maybe he'll lose because of ranked choice voting\n\n1:24:09.340 --> 1:24:10.260\n and all of that.\n\n1:24:10.260 --> 1:24:12.380\n But I consider Andrew, I mean, I know him a little bit\n\n1:24:12.380 --> 1:24:15.100\n and I've followed his candidacy from the very beginning.\n\n1:24:15.100 --> 1:24:16.660\n I consider him an inspiration.\n\n1:24:16.660 --> 1:24:19.660\n He's the new generation of politics.\n\n1:24:19.660 --> 1:24:22.900\n Like if I see who's gonna be president 20 years from now,\n\n1:24:22.900 --> 1:24:24.980\n it's gonna be, I'm not saying it's gonna be Andrew Yang.\n\n1:24:24.980 --> 1:24:27.220\n I think it's gonna be somebody like Andrew Yang\n\n1:24:27.220 --> 1:24:28.740\n outside the political system\n\n1:24:28.740 --> 1:24:31.700\n who talks in a totally different way, right?\n\n1:24:31.700 --> 1:24:34.280\n Just a completely, one of my favorite things\n\n1:24:34.280 --> 1:24:35.300\n that he said on the debate stage,\n\n1:24:35.300 --> 1:24:37.900\n he's like, look at us, we're all wearing makeup.\n\n1:24:37.900 --> 1:24:38.740\n It's crazy, you know?\n\n1:24:38.740 --> 1:24:42.180\n And he like, he like brought that, that he brought that.\n\n1:24:42.180 --> 1:24:44.580\n And he's writing like, yeah, why are they all wearing makeup?\n\n1:24:44.580 --> 1:24:47.380\n He probably arguably hasn't gone far enough almost.\n\n1:24:47.380 --> 1:24:48.500\n Yes.\n\n1:24:48.500 --> 1:24:50.040\n But he showed that it's possible.\n\n1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:53.260\n And then you see other, like AOC is a good example\n\n1:24:53.260 --> 1:24:55.420\n of somebody, at least in my opinion,\n\n1:24:55.420 --> 1:24:59.580\n is doing the same kind of thing, but going too far in like,\n\n1:24:59.580 --> 1:25:01.460\n well, I don't know, she's doing the Trump thing,\n\n1:25:01.460 --> 1:25:02.300\n but on the other side.\n\n1:25:02.300 --> 1:25:04.220\n So I don't know, what's too far?\n\n1:25:04.220 --> 1:25:05.060\n Who knows?\n\n1:25:05.060 --> 1:25:05.900\n Don't take a normative judgment of it.\n\n1:25:05.900 --> 1:25:06.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:07.560\n I will tell you the future of politics\n\n1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:08.640\n looks like AOC. Appreciate the art of it.\n\n1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:09.480\n Right, no, I do.\n\n1:25:09.480 --> 1:25:12.020\n Look, I don't, I'm not a big AOC fan,\n\n1:25:12.020 --> 1:25:14.180\n but she's a genius, media genius,\n\n1:25:14.180 --> 1:25:16.000\n once in a generation talent.\n\n1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:19.660\n The way that she uses social media, Instagram,\n\n1:25:19.660 --> 1:25:21.660\n and everybody on the right is like trying to copy her.\n\n1:25:21.660 --> 1:25:24.260\n Like Matt Gaetz is like, I want to be the conservative AOC.\n\n1:25:24.260 --> 1:25:25.580\n I'm like, it's just not going to happen, dude.\n\n1:25:25.580 --> 1:25:27.180\n Like you just don't have it.\n\n1:25:27.180 --> 1:25:29.900\n Like what she has, it's like, it's electric.\n\n1:25:29.900 --> 1:25:31.940\n And Trump had that.\n\n1:25:31.940 --> 1:25:33.620\n Like I've been to a Trump rally,\n\n1:25:33.620 --> 1:25:35.660\n like to cover as a journalist,\n\n1:25:35.660 --> 1:25:37.420\n and there's nothing like it in America.\n\n1:25:37.420 --> 1:25:39.020\n And Yang is similar.\n\n1:25:39.020 --> 1:25:40.440\n It's the same way where you're like,\n\n1:25:40.440 --> 1:25:43.060\n there is something going on here,\n\n1:25:43.060 --> 1:25:45.740\n which is just like, I've been doing Obama rally.\n\n1:25:45.740 --> 1:25:47.380\n I've been to a Clinton rally.\n\n1:25:47.380 --> 1:25:50.900\n I've been to several normal politics.\n\n1:25:50.900 --> 1:25:54.660\n It's fine, you know, with Trump and with Yang,\n\n1:25:54.660 --> 1:25:56.260\n it was, it's another world.\n\n1:25:56.260 --> 1:25:57.100\n It's another world.\n\n1:25:57.100 --> 1:25:57.940\n Yeah, Yang gang.\n\n1:25:57.940 --> 1:26:00.220\n There's probably thousands of people listening right now,\n\n1:26:00.220 --> 1:26:03.040\n who are just like doing a slow clap.\n\n1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:03.880\n Yes.\n\n1:26:03.880 --> 1:26:05.080\n I know, I know.\n\n1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:06.820\n Yang gang forever.\n\n1:26:06.820 --> 1:26:10.380\n Okay, but yeah, I mean, my worst fear,\n\n1:26:10.380 --> 1:26:15.380\n I prefer Andrew Yang kind of free improvisational idea,\n\n1:26:19.100 --> 1:26:21.620\n exchange, all that versus AOC,\n\n1:26:21.620 --> 1:26:25.420\n who I think no matter what she stands for\n\n1:26:25.420 --> 1:26:29.420\n is a drama machine, creates dramas just like Trump does.\n\n1:26:29.420 --> 1:26:33.260\n I would say my worst fear would be in 2024,\n\n1:26:33.260 --> 1:26:34.500\n is AOC old enough?\n\n1:26:34.500 --> 1:26:36.320\n It'd be AOC versus Trump.\n\n1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:37.420\n I don't think she's old enough.\n\n1:26:37.420 --> 1:26:38.860\n I think you'd have to be, I don't know.\n\n1:26:38.860 --> 1:26:39.700\n I think she's 30.\n\n1:26:39.700 --> 1:26:40.780\n So she needs five more years.\n\n1:26:40.780 --> 1:26:41.860\n So probably not.\n\n1:26:41.860 --> 1:26:42.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:42.700 --> 1:26:45.460\n Okay, but that kind of, that's, or Trump Jr.\n\n1:26:45.460 --> 1:26:47.620\n Well, AOC probably wouldn't win a Democratic primary.\n\n1:26:47.620 --> 1:26:49.660\n So, I mean, look, Joe Biden is, you know,\n\n1:26:49.660 --> 1:26:50.980\n he's pretty much showed that.\n\n1:26:50.980 --> 1:26:52.500\n That's exactly what you're saying.\n\n1:26:52.500 --> 1:26:55.820\n This process grooms you over time.\n\n1:26:55.820 --> 1:26:57.860\n You see the same thing in academia actually,\n\n1:26:57.860 --> 1:26:59.940\n which is very interesting,\n\n1:26:59.940 --> 1:27:02.520\n is the process of getting tenure.\n\n1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:06.060\n There's this, it's like you're being taught\n\n1:27:06.060 --> 1:27:09.640\n without explicitly being taught\n\n1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:14.480\n to behave in the way that everybody's behaved before.\n\n1:27:14.480 --> 1:27:15.640\n I've heard this, it was funny.\n\n1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:17.800\n I've had a few conversations\n\n1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:20.680\n that were deeply disappointing,\n\n1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:25.040\n which involved statements like,\n\n1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:28.080\n this is what's good for your career.\n\n1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:29.380\n This kind of conversation,\n\n1:27:29.380 --> 1:27:33.480\n almost like mentor to mentee conversation,\n\n1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:36.680\n or it's like, there's a grooming process in the same way.\n\n1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:39.040\n I guess you're saying the primary process\n\n1:27:39.040 --> 1:27:40.040\n does the same kind of thing.\n\n1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:42.320\n So, I mean, that's what people have talked about\n\n1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:43.160\n with Andrew Yang.\n\n1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:46.880\n He was being suppressed by a bunch of different forces,\n\n1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:48.520\n the mainstream media and all.\n\n1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:51.040\n Just the Democratic, just that whole process\n\n1:27:51.040 --> 1:27:55.240\n didn't like the honesty that he was showing, right?\n\n1:27:55.240 --> 1:27:57.360\n For now, but here's my question to you.\n\n1:27:57.360 --> 1:27:59.680\n People gotta see, look, Jordan Peterson\n\n1:27:59.680 --> 1:28:01.680\n is one of the most famous people in America, right?\n\n1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:03.680\n Like you have a massive podcast.\n\n1:28:03.680 --> 1:28:07.200\n You're more famous than half, 99% of the people at MIT.\n\n1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:10.680\n So like, from that perspective, everything has changed.\n\n1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:12.360\n And somewhere out there,\n\n1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:14.320\n there's a student who's taking notice.\n\n1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:16.040\n And I've noticed that with my own career,\n\n1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:17.280\n everybody thought I was crazy\n\n1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:19.040\n for doing this show with Crystal, The Hill.\n\n1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:19.880\n They thought I was nuts.\n\n1:28:19.880 --> 1:28:21.080\n They're like, what are you doing?\n\n1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:22.520\n You're a White House correspondent.\n\n1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:24.440\n You've got a job forever.\n\n1:28:24.440 --> 1:28:25.600\n The other job offer I had\n\n1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:27.280\n was being a White House correspondent.\n\n1:28:27.280 --> 1:28:29.440\n And people thought I was nuts\n\n1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:34.120\n for not just sticking there and aging out within Washington,\n\n1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:39.120\n pining for appearances on Fox News and CNN and MSNBC.\n\n1:28:39.240 --> 1:28:40.200\n But I hated it.\n\n1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:41.360\n I just hated doing it.\n\n1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:44.240\n I did not wanna be a company man, like a Washington man,\n\n1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:47.040\n who's one of those guys who like brags to his friends\n\n1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:49.440\n about how many times he's been on Fox or whatever,\n\n1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:51.760\n mostly because I just have a rebellious streak\n\n1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:55.280\n and I hate being at the subject of other people.\n\n1:28:55.280 --> 1:28:56.280\n I created something new,\n\n1:28:56.280 --> 1:28:58.360\n which a lot of people watch to get their news.\n\n1:28:58.360 --> 1:29:00.840\n And I noticed that younger people\n\n1:29:00.840 --> 1:29:02.760\n who are almost all my audience,\n\n1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:05.000\n they don't really look up to any of the people\n\n1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:06.080\n in traditional, right?\n\n1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:09.000\n They don't go and they're not coming up and being like,\n\n1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:10.800\n how do I be like Jim Acosta?\n\n1:29:10.800 --> 1:29:13.760\n You know, they're like, hey, how did you do what you do?\n\n1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:16.440\n And the way you did it is by bucking the system.\n\n1:29:16.440 --> 1:29:20.280\n So I think that we are at a total split point.\n\n1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:23.600\n And look, there will always be a path for people.\n\n1:29:23.600 --> 1:29:26.160\n Cause like, I don't want people to over learn this lesson.\n\n1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:27.760\n I have people who are like, I'm not gonna go to college.\n\n1:29:27.760 --> 1:29:29.360\n And I'm like, well, just wait.\n\n1:29:29.360 --> 1:29:32.400\n Yeah, like, I'm like, just like stop,\n\n1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:34.840\n just like, just hold on a second.\n\n1:29:34.840 --> 1:29:37.680\n But there will always be a path for the institutional\n\n1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:39.240\n that will always be there for you.\n\n1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:40.920\n But now there's something else.\n\n1:29:40.920 --> 1:29:42.400\n Now there's another game in town.\n\n1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:45.120\n And that's more appealing to millions and millions\n\n1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:46.960\n and millions and millions of people\n\n1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:50.080\n who feel unserved by the corporate media,\n\n1:29:50.080 --> 1:29:52.040\n CNN and these people,\n\n1:29:52.040 --> 1:29:56.000\n possibly who feel unserved in the, you know, the faculty.\n\n1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:59.000\n Like if you are an up and comer\n\n1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:02.640\n who wants to teach as many young people as possible,\n\n1:30:02.640 --> 1:30:04.600\n I think you should be on YouTube, right?\n\n1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:05.920\n Like look at the Khan Academy guy,\n\n1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:07.940\n that guy created a huge business.\n\n1:30:07.940 --> 1:30:10.520\n So I just think we can be cynical\n\n1:30:10.520 --> 1:30:12.640\n and like upset about what that system is,\n\n1:30:12.640 --> 1:30:14.000\n but we should also have hope.\n\n1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:16.960\n Like I have a lot of hope for what can be in the future.\n\n1:30:16.960 --> 1:30:18.920\n Yeah, there's a guy people should check out.\n\n1:30:18.920 --> 1:30:20.600\n So my story is a little bit different\n\n1:30:20.600 --> 1:30:24.080\n because I basically stepped aside\n\n1:30:24.080 --> 1:30:28.360\n with the dream of being an entrepreneur\n\n1:30:28.360 --> 1:30:30.320\n earlier in the pipeline\n\n1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:34.360\n than like a legitimate, like senior faculty would.\n\n1:30:34.360 --> 1:30:36.480\n There's an example of somebody people should check out,\n\n1:30:36.480 --> 1:30:40.200\n Andrew Huberman from Stanford, who's a neuroscientist,\n\n1:30:40.200 --> 1:30:42.480\n who's as world class as it gets\n\n1:30:42.480 --> 1:30:45.340\n in terms of like 10 year faculty,\n\n1:30:45.340 --> 1:30:48.320\n just a really world class researcher.\n\n1:30:48.320 --> 1:30:50.120\n And now he's doing YouTube.\n\n1:30:50.120 --> 1:30:51.380\n Yeah, I see him on Instagram.\n\n1:30:51.380 --> 1:30:52.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:52.220 --> 1:30:53.040\n And he's great.\n\n1:30:53.040 --> 1:30:56.640\n So he not just does Instagram, he now has a podcast\n\n1:30:56.640 --> 1:31:00.440\n and he's changing the nature of like,\n\n1:31:00.440 --> 1:31:04.760\n I believe that Andrew might be the future of Stanford.\n\n1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:08.320\n And for a lot, it's funny, like he's basically,\n\n1:31:08.320 --> 1:31:13.040\n Joe Rogan is an inspiration to Andrew and to me as well.\n\n1:31:13.040 --> 1:31:15.800\n And those ripple effects and Andrew is an inspiration\n\n1:31:15.800 --> 1:31:18.560\n probably just like you're saying to these young,\n\n1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:22.000\n like 25 year olds who are soon to become faculty,\n\n1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:23.800\n if we're just talking about academia.\n\n1:31:23.800 --> 1:31:27.920\n And the same is probably happening with government is,\n\n1:31:27.920 --> 1:31:31.540\n funny enough, Trump probably is inspiring\n\n1:31:31.540 --> 1:31:34.240\n a huge number of people who are saying, wait a minute,\n\n1:31:34.240 --> 1:31:36.120\n I don't have to play by the rules.\n\n1:31:36.120 --> 1:31:40.520\n And I can think outside the box here and you're right.\n\n1:31:40.520 --> 1:31:42.420\n And the institutions we're seeing\n\n1:31:42.420 --> 1:31:44.520\n are just probably lagging behind.\n\n1:31:44.520 --> 1:31:48.040\n So the optimistic view is the future\n\n1:31:48.040 --> 1:31:50.200\n is going to be full of exciting new ideas.\n\n1:31:50.200 --> 1:31:52.100\n So Andrew Young is just kind of the beginning\n\n1:31:52.100 --> 1:31:52.940\n of this whole thing.\n\n1:31:52.940 --> 1:31:54.480\n He's the tip of the iceberg.\n\n1:31:54.480 --> 1:31:57.720\n And I hope that iceberg doesn't, it's not this influencer.\n\n1:31:57.720 --> 1:32:01.240\n One of the things that really bothers me,\n\n1:32:01.240 --> 1:32:03.520\n I've gotten the chance, I should be careful here.\n\n1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:05.640\n I don't wanna, I love everybody,\n\n1:32:05.640 --> 1:32:09.680\n but these people who talk about like,\n\n1:32:09.680 --> 1:32:13.160\n how to make your first million or how to succeed.\n\n1:32:13.160 --> 1:32:16.520\n And they're so, I mean, yeah,\n\n1:32:16.520 --> 1:32:19.120\n that makes me a little bit cynical\n\n1:32:19.120 --> 1:32:23.800\n about, I'm worried that the people\n\n1:32:23.800 --> 1:32:26.240\n that win the game of politics will be ones\n\n1:32:26.240 --> 1:32:29.800\n that want to win the game of politics.\n\n1:32:29.800 --> 1:32:31.140\n They are, they are, man.\n\n1:32:31.140 --> 1:32:33.720\n And like we mentioned, AOC,\n\n1:32:33.720 --> 1:32:38.720\n I hope they optimize for the 80% populist thing, right?\n\n1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:42.360\n Like they optimize for that bad thing,\n\n1:32:42.360 --> 1:32:44.680\n that history will remember you as the great man\n\n1:32:44.680 --> 1:32:46.380\n or woman that did this thing,\n\n1:32:46.380 --> 1:32:50.000\n versus how do I maximize engagement today\n\n1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:51.720\n and keep growing those numbers?\n\n1:32:51.720 --> 1:32:55.640\n The influencers are so, I'm so allergic to this, man.\n\n1:32:56.520 --> 1:32:58.460\n They keep saying how many followers they have\n\n1:32:58.460 --> 1:33:00.080\n on the different accounts.\n\n1:33:00.080 --> 1:33:04.280\n And it's like, I don't think they understand.\n\n1:33:04.280 --> 1:33:05.760\n Maybe I don't understand.\n\n1:33:05.760 --> 1:33:06.780\n I don't really care.\n\n1:33:07.760 --> 1:33:12.340\n I think it has destructive psychological effects.\n\n1:33:13.360 --> 1:33:15.600\n One, like thinking about the number,\n\n1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:19.800\n like getting excited, your number went from 100 to 101\n\n1:33:19.800 --> 1:33:23.400\n and being like, and today went out to 105.\n\n1:33:23.400 --> 1:33:24.600\n Whoa, that's a big jump.\n\n1:33:24.600 --> 1:33:26.160\n Then maybe like thinking this way,\n\n1:33:26.160 --> 1:33:28.820\n like I wonder what I did, I'll do that again.\n\n1:33:28.820 --> 1:33:31.640\n In this way, one, it creates anxiety\n\n1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:34.040\n and those psychological effects, whatever.\n\n1:33:34.040 --> 1:33:37.040\n The more important thing is it prevents you\n\n1:33:37.040 --> 1:33:42.040\n from truly thinking boldly in the long arc of history\n\n1:33:42.040 --> 1:33:45.920\n and creatively, thinking outside the box,\n\n1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:48.000\n doing huge actions.\n\n1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.520\n And I actually, my optimism is in the sense\n\n1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:54.360\n that that kind of action will beat out all the influencers.\n\n1:33:54.360 --> 1:33:58.120\n Well, I don't know, Lex, this is where my cynicism comes in.\n\n1:33:58.120 --> 1:34:00.520\n So there's a guy, Madison Cawthorn,\n\n1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:02.760\n the youngest member of Congress.\n\n1:34:02.760 --> 1:34:05.760\n And he, I don't want to say got caught,\n\n1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:08.080\n but there was like an email where he was like,\n\n1:34:08.080 --> 1:34:11.640\n my staff is only oriented around comms.\n\n1:34:11.640 --> 1:34:12.740\n Like he was basically saying,\n\n1:34:12.740 --> 1:34:14.680\n he got basically caught saying like,\n\n1:34:14.680 --> 1:34:19.560\n my staff is only centered on communications.\n\n1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:21.200\n And that's the right play.\n\n1:34:21.200 --> 1:34:23.840\n If you do want to get the benefits\n\n1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:26.720\n of our current electoral political and engagement system,\n\n1:34:26.720 --> 1:34:29.260\n which is that what's the best way to be known\n\n1:34:29.260 --> 1:34:32.160\n within the right as a right wing politician.\n\n1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:36.680\n It's to be a culture warrior, go on Ben Shapiro's podcast,\n\n1:34:36.680 --> 1:34:39.040\n be one of the people on Fox News,\n\n1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:41.760\n go on Sean Hannity's show, go on Tucker's show\n\n1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:45.180\n and all of that, because you become a mini celebrity\n\n1:34:45.180 --> 1:34:46.960\n within that world.\n\n1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:50.360\n Left unsaid is that that world is increasingly shrinking\n\n1:34:50.360 --> 1:34:52.080\n portion of the American population.\n\n1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:56.020\n And they barely, they can't even win a popular vote election,\n\n1:34:56.020 --> 1:34:59.640\n let alone barely win, eke out an electoral college victory\n\n1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:01.640\n in 2016.\n\n1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:04.600\n Well, but the incentives are all aligned within that.\n\n1:35:04.600 --> 1:35:06.840\n And it's the same thing really on the left,\n\n1:35:06.840 --> 1:35:08.680\n but you're right, which is that,\n\n1:35:08.680 --> 1:35:11.520\n ultimately, and look, this is why geniuses are geniuses\n\n1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:15.160\n because they buck the short term incentives.\n\n1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:18.380\n They focus on the long term, they bet big\n\n1:35:18.380 --> 1:35:19.560\n and they usually fail.\n\n1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:24.640\n But then when they get big, they succeed spectacularly.\n\n1:35:24.640 --> 1:35:27.400\n The people I know who have done this the best\n\n1:35:27.400 --> 1:35:30.840\n are like a lot of the crypto folks that I've spoken to.\n\n1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:32.840\n Like some of the stuff they say, I'm like,\n\n1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:34.240\n I don't know if that's gonna happen,\n\n1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:36.280\n but look, they're like billionaires, right?\n\n1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:38.960\n And you're like, so they were right.\n\n1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:43.240\n The way I've heard it expressed is you can be wrong a lot,\n\n1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:45.680\n but when you're right, you get right big.\n\n1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:47.680\n And I mean, I've seen this in Elon Musk's career.\n\n1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:52.680\n I mean, he took spectacular risk, like spectacular risk\n\n1:35:52.720 --> 1:35:55.000\n and just doubled down, doubled down, doubled down,\n\n1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:56.120\n doubled down, doubled down.\n\n1:35:56.120 --> 1:35:57.760\n And you can kind of tell to him,\n\n1:35:57.760 --> 1:35:59.040\n I mean, you know him better than I do,\n\n1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:00.560\n but like from my observation,\n\n1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:03.360\n I don't think the money matters, right?\n\n1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:07.080\n I just, like when I see him, I'm like, I don't,\n\n1:36:07.080 --> 1:36:08.760\n nobody works as hard as you do\n\n1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:10.920\n and builds the way that you build\n\n1:36:10.920 --> 1:36:12.280\n if it's just about the money.\n\n1:36:12.280 --> 1:36:13.680\n It just doesn't happen.\n\n1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:18.320\n Like nobody wills SpaceX into existence just for the money.\n\n1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:19.880\n Like it's not worth it, frankly, right?\n\n1:36:19.880 --> 1:36:21.840\n Like he probably destroyed years of his life\n\n1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:23.440\n and like mental sanity.\n\n1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:25.280\n Money or attention or fame, none of that.\n\n1:36:25.280 --> 1:36:26.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:26.960\n It's not the primary priority.\n\n1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:28.520\n Well, that's what's so appealing to me,\n\n1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:31.360\n to me in particular about him, just like in how he built.\n\n1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:32.640\n Like I read a biography of him\n\n1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:34.880\n and just like the way that he constructed his life\n\n1:36:34.880 --> 1:36:36.680\n and like we're able to hyperfocus\n\n1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:38.560\n in meeting after meeting and drill down\n\n1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:40.480\n and also hire all the right people\n\n1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:43.320\n who execute each one of his tasks discreetly\n\n1:36:43.320 --> 1:36:45.480\n to his perfection is amazing.\n\n1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:48.520\n Like that's actually the mark of a good leader.\n\n1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:50.680\n But I mean, if you think about his career,\n\n1:36:50.680 --> 1:36:53.200\n the reason he's a renegade is cause probably he was told\n\n1:36:53.200 --> 1:36:55.440\n to like put it in an index fund or whatever.\n\n1:36:55.440 --> 1:36:57.480\n Like whenever he made his like 29 million\n\n1:36:57.480 --> 1:36:59.520\n and from PayPal, I don't know how much he made.\n\n1:36:59.520 --> 1:37:01.360\n And then just go along that road and he's like, no.\n\n1:37:01.360 --> 1:37:04.040\n So he succeeds spectacularly.\n\n1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:07.240\n So you have to have somebody who's willing to come in\n\n1:37:07.240 --> 1:37:08.240\n and buck that system.\n\n1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:12.080\n So for now, I think our politics are generally frozen.\n\n1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:16.880\n I think that that model is gonna be most generally appealing\n\n1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:20.120\n to the mean person, but somebody will come along\n\n1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:20.960\n and we'll change everything.\n\n1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:22.720\n Yeah, I'm just surprised there's not more of them.\n\n1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:23.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:28.040\n On that topic, it's now 20, what is it, 21?\n\n1:37:28.040 --> 1:37:28.880\n Yes.\n\n1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:31.520\n Let's make some predictions that you can be wrong about.\n\n1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:32.360\n Good.\n\n1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:38.120\n What major political people are you thinking will run\n\n1:37:38.120 --> 1:37:43.120\n in 2024, including Trump, junior, senior, or Ivanka?\n\n1:37:44.160 --> 1:37:45.000\n I don't know.\n\n1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:47.160\n Any Trump.\n\n1:37:47.160 --> 1:37:48.000\n Trump.\n\n1:37:49.960 --> 1:37:52.360\n And who do you think wins?\n\n1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:56.080\n I think Joe Biden will run again in 2024.\n\n1:37:56.080 --> 1:37:57.680\n And I think he will run against someone\n\n1:37:57.680 --> 1:37:59.600\n with the last name Trump.\n\n1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:03.800\n I do not know whether that is Trump or Trump junior,\n\n1:38:03.800 --> 1:38:06.160\n but I think one of those people will probably\n\n1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:08.240\n be the GOP nominee in 2024.\n\n1:38:08.240 --> 1:38:09.080\n Who is it?\n\n1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:11.360\n Some prominent political figure, was it Romney?\n\n1:38:11.360 --> 1:38:14.400\n Somebody like that said that Trump will win the primary\n\n1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:15.240\n if he runs again.\n\n1:38:15.240 --> 1:38:16.680\n Of course, that's not even a question.\n\n1:38:16.680 --> 1:38:19.000\n Trump is the single most popular figure\n\n1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:22.320\n in the Republican party by orders of magnitude.\n\n1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:23.160\n Still.\n\n1:38:23.160 --> 1:38:25.280\n Oh, I mean, probably more, honestly.\n\n1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:26.680\n There was a, actually, I can tell you\n\n1:38:26.680 --> 1:38:30.240\n because I saw the data, which is that pre January 6th,\n\n1:38:30.240 --> 1:38:33.720\n it was like 54% of Republicans wanted him to run again.\n\n1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:37.320\n Then it went down eight points after January 6th,\n\n1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:38.400\n two days later.\n\n1:38:38.400 --> 1:38:42.400\n And then after impeachment, it went right back up to 54%.\n\n1:38:42.400 --> 1:38:47.160\n So the exact same number is in February,\n\n1:38:47.160 --> 1:38:50.000\n post impeachment vote, as it was after November.\n\n1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.600\n Now look, yeah, again, surveys, bullshit, et cetera.\n\n1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:54.080\n But like, that's all the data we have.\n\n1:38:54.080 --> 1:38:55.480\n That's what I can point you to.\n\n1:38:55.480 --> 1:38:57.840\n If Trump runs, he will be the nominee\n\n1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:00.920\n and he will be the 2024 nominee.\n\n1:39:00.920 --> 1:39:02.320\n I just don't know if he wants to.\n\n1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:04.120\n It really depends.\n\n1:39:04.120 --> 1:39:05.560\n Do you think he wins?\n\n1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:09.080\n After the Trump vaccine heals all of us,\n\n1:39:09.080 --> 1:39:10.200\n do you think Trump wins?\n\n1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:12.440\n It depends on how popular culture functions\n\n1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:13.480\n over the next four years.\n\n1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:15.200\n And I can tell you that they are,\n\n1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:17.040\n because I don't think Biden has that much to do with it.\n\n1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:20.840\n Because again, Trump is not a manifestation\n\n1:39:20.840 --> 1:39:22.880\n of an affirmative policy action.\n\n1:39:22.880 --> 1:39:27.880\n It is a defensive bulwark wall against cultural liberalism.\n\n1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:33.320\n So it's like, this is why it doesn't matter what Biden does.\n\n1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:35.120\n If there are more riots,\n\n1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:38.840\n if there is a more sense of persecution\n\n1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:42.960\n amongst people who are more lean towards conservative\n\n1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:45.760\n or like, hey, I don't know about that, that's crazy,\n\n1:39:45.760 --> 1:39:48.600\n then he very well could win.\n\n1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:50.080\n Okay, let's say Joe Biden doesn't run\n\n1:39:50.080 --> 1:39:51.320\n and they put up like Kamala Harris,\n\n1:39:51.320 --> 1:39:53.000\n I think he would beat her.\n\n1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:54.680\n I don't think there's a question\n\n1:39:54.680 --> 1:39:56.920\n that Trump would beat Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\n1:39:57.920 --> 1:39:59.480\n And you don't think anybody else,\n\n1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:01.160\n I don't know how the process works,\n\n1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:03.200\n you don't think anybody else on the Democratic side\n\n1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:04.720\n can take the...\n\n1:40:04.720 --> 1:40:07.680\n Well, how could you run against the sitting vice president?\n\n1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:11.360\n It's like, Joe Biden has a 98% approval rating\n\n1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:12.640\n in the Democratic Party.\n\n1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:14.680\n If he says, she is my heir,\n\n1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:16.400\n I think enough people will listen to him\n\n1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:19.240\n in a competitive primary or a noncompetitive primary.\n\n1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:20.240\n And then there's all these things\n\n1:40:20.240 --> 1:40:23.080\n about how primary systems themselves are rigged,\n\n1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:25.040\n the DNC could make it known\n\n1:40:25.040 --> 1:40:26.520\n that they'll blacklist anybody\n\n1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:29.760\n who does try and primary Kamala Harris.\n\n1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:31.160\n And look, I mean,\n\n1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:33.480\n progressives aren't necessarily all that popular\n\n1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:34.960\n amongst actual Democrats,\n\n1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:37.760\n like we found that out during the election.\n\n1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:40.640\n There's an entire constituency which loves Joe Biden\n\n1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:42.240\n and Joe Biden level politics.\n\n1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:44.640\n And so if he tells them to vote for Kamala,\n\n1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:47.120\n I think she would probably get it.\n\n1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:49.960\n But again, there's a lot of game theory obviously happening.\n\n1:40:49.960 --> 1:40:52.200\n Well, see, I think you're talking about\n\n1:40:52.200 --> 1:40:54.080\n everything you're saying is correct\n\n1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:55.960\n about mediocre candidates.\n\n1:40:55.960 --> 1:40:59.600\n It feels like if there's somebody like a really strong,\n\n1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:01.480\n I don't wanna use this term incorrectly,\n\n1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:05.400\n but populist, somebody that speaks to the 80%\n\n1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:10.400\n that is able to provide bold,\n\n1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:15.080\n eloquently described solutions that are popular.\n\n1:41:15.080 --> 1:41:17.200\n I think that breaks through all of this nonsense.\n\n1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:18.040\n How?\n\n1:41:18.040 --> 1:41:19.560\n How do they break through the primary system?\n\n1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:22.520\n Cause the problem is the primary system is not populism.\n\n1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:24.020\n It's primary.\n\n1:41:24.020 --> 1:41:24.860\n So it's like.\n\n1:41:24.860 --> 1:41:27.720\n But you don't think they can tweet their way to.\n\n1:41:27.720 --> 1:41:30.720\n Well, you have to be willing to win a GOP primary.\n\n1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:32.760\n You basically have to be at,\n\n1:41:32.760 --> 1:41:35.440\n whoever wins the GOP primary, in my opinion,\n\n1:41:35.440 --> 1:41:37.660\n will be the person most hated by the left.\n\n1:41:37.660 --> 1:41:40.000\n One of the people, things that people forget is,\n\n1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:41.920\n you know who came in second to Trump?\n\n1:41:41.920 --> 1:41:42.960\n Ted Cruz.\n\n1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:44.960\n And the reason why is because Ted Cruz\n\n1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:48.720\n was the second most hated guy by liberals in America.\n\n1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:49.880\n A second to Trump.\n\n1:41:49.880 --> 1:41:51.560\n They have nothing in policy in common.\n\n1:41:51.560 --> 1:41:54.880\n But don't you think this kind of brilliantly described\n\n1:41:54.880 --> 1:41:59.880\n system of hate being the main mechanism\n\n1:41:59.940 --> 1:42:02.240\n of our electoral choices,\n\n1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:05.240\n don't you think that just has to do with mediocre candidates?\n\n1:42:08.400 --> 1:42:11.240\n Basically the field of candidates, including Trump,\n\n1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:13.680\n including everybody was just like,\n\n1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:16.680\n didn't make anyone feel great.\n\n1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:17.680\n It's like, really?\n\n1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:19.680\n This is what we have to choose from?\n\n1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:22.120\n Maybe a Mark Cuban,\n\n1:42:22.120 --> 1:42:26.060\n or like a Mark Cuban is a Democrat,\n\n1:42:26.060 --> 1:42:29.140\n or it would have to be somebody like that.\n\n1:42:29.140 --> 1:42:30.920\n Somebody who, because here's the thing about Trump.\n\n1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:32.360\n It's not just that it was Trump.\n\n1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:34.320\n He was so fucking famous.\n\n1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:36.880\n Like people don't realize he was so famous.\n\n1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:39.880\n Like I, even when I first met Trump,\n\n1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:41.720\n I met a couple of other presidents,\n\n1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:44.520\n but when I met Trump, even I felt like kind of starstruck.\n\n1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:47.440\n Cause I was like, yo, this is the guy from The Apprentice.\n\n1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:49.440\n I'm like, this is the dude.\n\n1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:50.800\n From The Apprentice?\n\n1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:53.160\n Cause I'm like, my dad and I used to sit\n\n1:42:53.160 --> 1:42:55.400\n and watch The Apprentice when I was in high school.\n\n1:42:55.400 --> 1:42:57.480\n And then one of the guys was from College Station\n\n1:42:57.480 --> 1:42:58.480\n where I grew up and we're like,\n\n1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:00.880\n oh my God, like that guy's on The Apprentice.\n\n1:43:00.880 --> 1:43:02.240\n Like it was a phenomenon.\n\n1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:03.080\n There's like that level.\n\n1:43:03.080 --> 1:43:04.240\n It's kind of like when I met Joe Rogan,\n\n1:43:04.240 --> 1:43:06.720\n I'm like, holy shit, that's Joe Rogan.\n\n1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:08.600\n I don't feel that way when I meet Mitt Romney,\n\n1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:11.000\n or Tom Cotton, or Josh Hawley, I met all of them.\n\n1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:12.440\n But there's a lot of celebrities, right?\n\n1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:13.520\n Do you think there's some celebrities\n\n1:43:13.520 --> 1:43:15.480\n you were not even thinking about that could step in?\n\n1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:16.320\n The Rock?\n\n1:43:16.320 --> 1:43:19.440\n So I was about to say, I think The Rock could do it,\n\n1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:20.840\n but does he wanna do it?\n\n1:43:20.840 --> 1:43:21.880\n I mean, it's terrible.\n\n1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:23.720\n Like it's terrible gig.\n\n1:43:23.720 --> 1:43:25.400\n It's very hard to do.\n\n1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:27.480\n I don't know if The Rock necessarily has\n\n1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:29.640\n like the formed policy agenda.\n\n1:43:29.640 --> 1:43:31.080\n Cause then here's the other problem.\n\n1:43:31.080 --> 1:43:32.880\n What if we set ourselves up for a system\n\n1:43:32.880 --> 1:43:34.300\n where like these people keep winning,\n\n1:43:34.300 --> 1:43:35.880\n but like with Trump, they have no idea\n\n1:43:35.880 --> 1:43:37.000\n how to run a government.\n\n1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:38.600\n It's actually really hard, right?\n\n1:43:38.600 --> 1:43:41.000\n And you have to have the knowhow and the trust\n\n1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:42.840\n to find the right people.\n\n1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:46.600\n This is where the genius element comes in is,\n\n1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:48.540\n you have to understand that front\n\n1:43:48.540 --> 1:43:52.000\n and you have to understand how to execute discrete tasks.\n\n1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:54.440\n Like this is the FDR.\n\n1:43:54.440 --> 1:43:58.560\n This is why it's so hard, like FDR, Lincoln, TR.\n\n1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:00.920\n They were who they were and they live in history\n\n1:44:00.920 --> 1:44:04.220\n and their name rings like for a reason.\n\n1:44:04.220 --> 1:44:07.060\n And yeah, I mean, one of the most depressing lessons\n\n1:44:07.060 --> 1:44:11.900\n I got from 2020 is at almost, it seems like in my opinion,\n\n1:44:11.900 --> 1:44:15.200\n that we over learn the lesson of our success\n\n1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:16.520\n and not of our failures.\n\n1:44:16.520 --> 1:44:19.520\n For example, like we have this narrative in our head\n\n1:44:19.520 --> 1:44:21.860\n that we always have the right person\n\n1:44:21.860 --> 1:44:23.880\n at the right time during crisis.\n\n1:44:23.880 --> 1:44:25.600\n And in some cases it was true.\n\n1:44:25.600 --> 1:44:26.940\n We didn't deserve Lincoln.\n\n1:44:26.940 --> 1:44:28.520\n We didn't deserve FDR.\n\n1:44:28.520 --> 1:44:33.360\n We didn't deserve a lot of presidents at times of crisis.\n\n1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:36.800\n But then you're like, okay, George W. Bush, 9 11,\n\n1:44:36.800 --> 1:44:38.460\n that was terrible.\n\n1:44:38.460 --> 1:44:41.800\n Reconstruction, Andrew Johnson, awful, right?\n\n1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:44.480\n Like we had several periods in our history\n\n1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:48.440\n where the crisis was there, they were called\n\n1:44:48.440 --> 1:44:50.120\n and they did not show up.\n\n1:44:50.120 --> 1:44:54.040\n And I really, it hadn't happened in my lifetime\n\n1:44:54.040 --> 1:44:55.640\n except for 9 11.\n\n1:44:55.640 --> 1:44:58.760\n And even then you could kind of see that as an opportunity\n\n1:44:58.760 --> 1:45:01.320\n for somebody like Obama to come in and fix it.\n\n1:45:01.320 --> 1:45:02.640\n But then he didn't do it.\n\n1:45:02.640 --> 1:45:04.520\n And then Trump didn't do it.\n\n1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:09.260\n And you realize, I feel like our politics are most analogous\n\n1:45:09.260 --> 1:45:13.960\n to like the 1910s, like all in terms of the Gilded Age,\n\n1:45:13.960 --> 1:45:16.600\n in terms of that, remember there's that long period\n\n1:45:16.600 --> 1:45:21.600\n of presidents between like Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt.\n\n1:45:22.360 --> 1:45:24.440\n We were like, wait, like who was president?\n\n1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:27.520\n Like, or even TR was like an exception\n\n1:45:27.520 --> 1:45:30.040\n where you'll have like Calvin Coolidge who like,\n\n1:45:30.040 --> 1:45:33.100\n silent cow, Grover Cleveland.\n\n1:45:33.100 --> 1:45:36.600\n That's kind of how, if I think of us within history,\n\n1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:38.820\n I feel like we're in one of those times.\n\n1:45:38.820 --> 1:45:39.660\n We're just waiting.\n\n1:45:39.660 --> 1:45:41.600\n It feels really important to us right now.\n\n1:45:41.600 --> 1:45:43.600\n Like this is the most important moment in history,\n\n1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:44.440\n but it might be.\n\n1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:45.800\n It could just be a blip, right?\n\n1:45:45.800 --> 1:45:46.860\n 20, 30 year blip.\n\n1:45:46.860 --> 1:45:48.820\n Like when you think about who was president\n\n1:45:48.820 --> 1:45:52.180\n between 1890 and 19 before, I mean, yeah,\n\n1:45:52.180 --> 1:45:56.700\n between like 1888 and 1910.\n\n1:45:56.700 --> 1:45:58.840\n Like nobody really thinks about that period of America,\n\n1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:01.580\n but like that was an entire lifetime for people, right?\n\n1:46:01.580 --> 1:46:03.600\n Like what did they, how did they feel\n\n1:46:03.600 --> 1:46:04.920\n about the country that they were in?\n\n1:46:04.920 --> 1:46:05.760\n That's hilarious.\n\n1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:07.280\n That's how I kind of think about where we are right now.\n\n1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:08.120\n It's funny to think.\n\n1:46:08.120 --> 1:46:09.400\n I mean, I don't want to minimize it,\n\n1:46:09.400 --> 1:46:11.080\n but like we haven't really gone\n\n1:46:11.080 --> 1:46:13.960\n through a World War II style crisis.\n\n1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:17.520\n So like, say that there is a crisis\n\n1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:21.400\n in like several decades of that level, right?\n\n1:46:21.400 --> 1:46:25.040\n Existential risks to a large portion of the world.\n\n1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:29.880\n Then what will be remembered is World War II,\n\n1:46:29.880 --> 1:46:31.600\n maybe a little bit about Vietnam\n\n1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:34.080\n and then whatever that crisis is.\n\n1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:35.960\n And this whole period that we see as dramatic,\n\n1:46:35.960 --> 1:46:37.280\n even coronavirus.\n\n1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:38.120\n Even 9 11.\n\n1:46:38.120 --> 1:46:41.640\n Even 9 11, it's like, cause you can look\n\n1:46:41.640 --> 1:46:43.680\n at how many people died and all those kinds of things,\n\n1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:45.840\n all the drama around the war on terror\n\n1:46:45.840 --> 1:46:47.720\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:46:47.720 --> 1:46:49.600\n Maybe Obama will be remembered\n\n1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:52.360\n for being the first African American president,\n\n1:46:52.360 --> 1:46:55.640\n but then like that's, yeah, that's fascinating\n\n1:46:55.640 --> 1:46:59.040\n to think about, oh man, even Trump will be like,\n\n1:46:59.040 --> 1:47:00.600\n oh, okay, cool.\n\n1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:01.440\n That guy.\n\n1:47:01.440 --> 1:47:03.480\n Yeah, like maybe he'd be remembered\n\n1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:08.360\n as the first celebrity.\n\n1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:10.720\n I mean, Reagan was already a governor, right?\n\n1:47:10.720 --> 1:47:14.960\n Yeah, so like the first apolitical celebrity that was,\n\n1:47:14.960 --> 1:47:18.000\n so maybe if there's more celebrities in the future,\n\n1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:19.720\n they'll say that Trump was the first person\n\n1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:23.160\n to pave the way for celebrities to win.\n\n1:47:23.160 --> 1:47:24.880\n Oh man, yeah.\n\n1:47:25.840 --> 1:47:29.040\n And yeah, I still hold that this era\n\n1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:30.560\n will probably be remembered.\n\n1:47:30.560 --> 1:47:34.480\n You know, people say I talk about Elon way too much,\n\n1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:37.840\n but the reality is like, there's not many people\n\n1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:39.560\n that are doing the kind of things he's doing\n\n1:47:39.560 --> 1:47:41.240\n is why I talk about it.\n\n1:47:41.240 --> 1:47:44.760\n I think this era, it's not necessarily Elon and SpaceX,\n\n1:47:44.760 --> 1:47:48.720\n but this era will be remembered by the new,\n\n1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:51.560\n the like of the space exploration,\n\n1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:54.280\n of the commercial of companies getting\n\n1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:57.320\n into space exploration of space travel.\n\n1:47:57.320 --> 1:48:01.760\n And perhaps like artificial intelligence\n\n1:48:01.760 --> 1:48:04.160\n around social media, all those kinds of things,\n\n1:48:04.160 --> 1:48:06.160\n this might be remembered for that.\n\n1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:07.640\n But every, all the political bickering,\n\n1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:11.160\n all that nonsense, that might be very well forgotten.\n\n1:48:11.160 --> 1:48:16.240\n One way to think about it is that the internet is so young.\n\n1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:18.920\n I think about it, so Jeff Jarvis,\n\n1:48:18.920 --> 1:48:20.920\n he's a media scholar I respect.\n\n1:48:20.920 --> 1:48:22.160\n He's not the only person to say this,\n\n1:48:22.160 --> 1:48:23.920\n but many others have, which is that, look,\n\n1:48:23.920 --> 1:48:25.800\n this is kind of like the printing press.\n\n1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:27.680\n There was a whole 30 years war\n\n1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:29.320\n because of the printing press.\n\n1:48:29.320 --> 1:48:31.800\n It took a long time for shit to sort out.\n\n1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:33.200\n I think that's where we're at with the internet.\n\n1:48:33.200 --> 1:48:36.320\n Like at a certain level, it disrupts everything.\n\n1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:37.360\n And that's a good thing.\n\n1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:38.880\n It can be very tumultuous.\n\n1:48:39.880 --> 1:48:41.880\n I never felt like I was living through history\n\n1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:43.080\n until coronavirus.\n\n1:48:43.080 --> 1:48:45.120\n Like, you know, like until we were all locked down,\n\n1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:46.960\n I was like, I'm living through history.\n\n1:48:46.960 --> 1:48:50.400\n Like this, there's this very overused cliche in DC\n\n1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:52.320\n where every comm staffer wants you to think\n\n1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:54.400\n that what their boss just did is history.\n\n1:48:54.400 --> 1:48:56.040\n And I've always been like, this isn't history.\n\n1:48:56.040 --> 1:48:58.320\n This is some like stupid fucking bill, you know, whatever.\n\n1:48:58.320 --> 1:49:00.240\n But like, that was the first time I was like,\n\n1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:03.120\n this is history, like this right here.\n\n1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:06.800\n Well, I was hoping, tragedy aside,\n\n1:49:06.800 --> 1:49:10.800\n that this, I wish the primaries happened during coronavirus\n\n1:49:10.800 --> 1:49:14.000\n so that we, because like, then we can see the,\n\n1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:17.480\n so, okay, here's a bunch of people facing crisis.\n\n1:49:17.480 --> 1:49:20.120\n It's an opportunity for a leader to step up.\n\n1:49:20.120 --> 1:49:22.840\n Like, I still believe the optimistic view\n\n1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:27.520\n is the game theory of like influencers\n\n1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:31.360\n will always be defeated by actual great leaders.\n\n1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:34.200\n So like, maybe the great leaders are rare,\n\n1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:36.800\n but I think they're sufficiently out there\n\n1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:39.880\n that they will step up, especially in moments of crisis.\n\n1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:43.160\n And coronavirus is obviously a crisis\n\n1:49:43.160 --> 1:49:46.920\n where like, you know, mass manufacture of tests,\n\n1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:50.720\n all kinds of infrastructure building\n\n1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:52.520\n that you could have done in 2020,\n\n1:49:52.520 --> 1:49:56.120\n there's so many possibilities for just like bold action.\n\n1:49:56.120 --> 1:50:00.680\n And none of that, even just,\n\n1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:04.800\n forget actually doing the action, advocating for it.\n\n1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:07.800\n Just saying like this, we need to do this.\n\n1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:11.680\n And none of that, like the speeches that Biden made,\n\n1:50:11.680 --> 1:50:14.800\n I don't even remember a single speech that Biden made\n\n1:50:14.800 --> 1:50:17.240\n because there's zero bold, I mean, their strategy\n\n1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:21.480\n was to be quiet and let Donald Trump.\n\n1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:23.040\n Polarize the electorate.\n\n1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:25.480\n Polarize the electorate and hope that results\n\n1:50:25.480 --> 1:50:30.480\n in them winning because of the high unemployment numbers\n\n1:50:30.680 --> 1:50:31.960\n and all those kinds of things,\n\n1:50:31.960 --> 1:50:34.640\n as opposed to like, let's go big,\n\n1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:36.160\n let's go with a big speech.\n\n1:50:36.160 --> 1:50:39.840\n Like, you know, that, yeah,\n\n1:50:39.840 --> 1:50:42.720\n it's a lost opportunity in some sense.\n\n1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:44.280\n So we talked a bunch about politics,\n\n1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:45.960\n but one of the other interesting things\n\n1:50:45.960 --> 1:50:48.440\n is that you're involved with is,\n\n1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:53.200\n or involved with defining the future of as journalism.\n\n1:50:53.200 --> 1:50:55.000\n I suppose you can think of podcasts\n\n1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:56.280\n as a kind of journalism,\n\n1:50:56.280 --> 1:50:58.800\n but also just writing in general,\n\n1:50:58.800 --> 1:51:01.760\n just whatever the hell the future of this thing looks like\n\n1:51:02.800 --> 1:51:05.440\n is up to be defined by people like you.\n\n1:51:05.440 --> 1:51:09.120\n So what do you think is broken about journalism\n\n1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:11.760\n and what do you think is the future of journalism?\n\n1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:14.720\n I think the future of journalism looks much more like\n\n1:51:14.720 --> 1:51:17.120\n what we, you and I are doing here right now.\n\n1:51:17.120 --> 1:51:20.800\n And journalism is gonna be downstream from a culture\n\n1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:22.200\n that can be a good and a bad thing\n\n1:51:22.200 --> 1:51:23.960\n depending on how you look at it.\n\n1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:26.120\n We are gonna look at our media,\n\n1:51:26.120 --> 1:51:29.400\n our media is gonna look much more like it did\n\n1:51:29.400 --> 1:51:31.120\n pre mass media.\n\n1:51:31.120 --> 1:51:35.480\n And the way that I mean that is that back in the 18,\n\n1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:38.040\n in the 1800s in particular,\n\n1:51:38.040 --> 1:51:40.200\n especially after the invention of the telegraph\n\n1:51:40.200 --> 1:51:43.120\n when information itself was known.\n\n1:51:43.120 --> 1:51:46.040\n So for example, like you and I don't need to,\n\n1:51:46.040 --> 1:51:47.800\n let's say you and I are competing journalists.\n\n1:51:47.800 --> 1:51:50.800\n You and I are no longer competing quote unquote\n\n1:51:50.800 --> 1:51:54.120\n to tell the public X event happened.\n\n1:51:54.120 --> 1:51:58.800\n All journalism today is largely explaining\n\n1:51:58.800 --> 1:52:01.280\n why did X happen.\n\n1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:04.400\n And part of the problem with that is that\n\n1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:08.080\n that means that it's all up for partisan interpretation.\n\n1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:09.800\n Now you can say that that's a bad thing.\n\n1:52:09.800 --> 1:52:11.080\n I think it's a great thing\n\n1:52:11.080 --> 1:52:13.680\n because the highest level of literacy\n\n1:52:13.680 --> 1:52:17.040\n and news viewership in America\n\n1:52:17.040 --> 1:52:19.720\n was during the time of yellow journalism,\n\n1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:22.080\n was during the time of partisan journalism.\n\n1:52:22.080 --> 1:52:23.000\n Not a surprise.\n\n1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:25.760\n People like to read the news from people\n\n1:52:25.760 --> 1:52:26.800\n that they agree with.\n\n1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:29.920\n You could say that's bad, echo chambers, et cetera.\n\n1:52:29.920 --> 1:52:31.200\n That's the downside of it.\n\n1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:33.440\n The upside is more people are more educated.\n\n1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:36.520\n More people are interested in the news.\n\n1:52:36.520 --> 1:52:40.000\n So I think the proliferation of mass media,\n\n1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:41.760\n I mean, sorry, of this format\n\n1:52:41.760 --> 1:52:45.920\n of niching, of not just long form.\n\n1:52:45.920 --> 1:52:48.800\n Dude, I do updates on Instagram, which are five minutes.\n\n1:52:48.800 --> 1:52:51.920\n Are you considered like Instagram, almost even Twitter?\n\n1:52:51.920 --> 1:52:53.080\n Oh, of course, Twitter.\n\n1:52:53.080 --> 1:52:54.560\n Twitter is where I get my news from.\n\n1:52:54.560 --> 1:52:55.400\n I don't read the paper.\n\n1:52:55.400 --> 1:52:57.640\n I have literally, Twitter is my news aggregator.\n\n1:52:57.640 --> 1:53:01.160\n It's called my wire where I find out about hard events.\n\n1:53:01.160 --> 1:53:03.280\n Like the president has departed the White House.\n\n1:53:03.280 --> 1:53:04.800\n But not only that, I don't know about you,\n\n1:53:04.800 --> 1:53:06.680\n but I also looked at Twitter\n\n1:53:06.680 --> 1:53:07.880\n to the exact thing you're saying,\n\n1:53:07.880 --> 1:53:09.600\n which is the response to the news,\n\n1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:12.960\n like the thoughtful sounds ridiculous,\n\n1:53:12.960 --> 1:53:15.720\n but you can be pretty thoughtful in a single tweet.\n\n1:53:15.720 --> 1:53:18.480\n If you follow the right people, you can get that.\n\n1:53:18.480 --> 1:53:21.000\n And so that is the future of media,\n\n1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:22.840\n which is that the future of media\n\n1:53:22.840 --> 1:53:27.480\n is it will be much larger amounts of people,\n\n1:53:27.480 --> 1:53:29.520\n which are famous to smaller groups.\n\n1:53:29.520 --> 1:53:32.160\n So Walter Cronkite's never gonna happen again,\n\n1:53:32.160 --> 1:53:34.280\n at least probably within our lifetimes,\n\n1:53:34.280 --> 1:53:37.960\n where everybody in America knows who this guy is.\n\n1:53:37.960 --> 1:53:39.120\n That age is over.\n\n1:53:39.120 --> 1:53:40.400\n I think that's a good thing\n\n1:53:40.400 --> 1:53:42.880\n because now people are gonna get the news\n\n1:53:42.880 --> 1:53:44.760\n from the people that they trust.\n\n1:53:44.760 --> 1:53:46.400\n Yes, some of it will be opinionated.\n\n1:53:46.400 --> 1:53:49.040\n I'm in my program.\n\n1:53:49.040 --> 1:53:53.720\n Crystal and I are like, she's coming from this view.\n\n1:53:53.720 --> 1:53:55.080\n I'm coming from this view.\n\n1:53:55.080 --> 1:53:57.600\n That's our bias when we talk about information\n\n1:53:57.600 --> 1:53:59.120\n and we're gonna talk about the information\n\n1:53:59.120 --> 1:54:00.760\n that we think is important.\n\n1:54:00.760 --> 1:54:02.720\n And it has garnered a large audience.\n\n1:54:02.720 --> 1:54:06.160\n I think that's very much where the future is gonna be.\n\n1:54:06.160 --> 1:54:08.680\n And the reason why I think that's a good thing\n\n1:54:08.680 --> 1:54:13.160\n is because people will be engaged more within it\n\n1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:14.720\n rather than the current system\n\n1:54:14.720 --> 1:54:17.880\n where news is highly concentrated, highly consolidated,\n\n1:54:17.880 --> 1:54:19.080\n has group think,\n\n1:54:19.080 --> 1:54:22.880\n has the same elite production pipeline problem\n\n1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:25.240\n of everybody knows journalists all come\n\n1:54:25.240 --> 1:54:27.240\n from the same socioeconomic background\n\n1:54:27.240 --> 1:54:30.040\n and they all party together here in DC or in New York\n\n1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:31.800\n or in LA or wherever,\n\n1:54:31.800 --> 1:54:33.760\n and they're part of the same monoculture\n\n1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:37.080\n and that affects what they report.\n\n1:54:37.080 --> 1:54:40.480\n This will cause a total dispersion of all of that.\n\n1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:44.600\n The battle of our age is gonna be the guild\n\n1:54:44.600 --> 1:54:46.160\n versus the non guild.\n\n1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:48.120\n So like what we see right now\n\n1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:50.640\n with the New York Times and Clubhouse,\n\n1:54:50.640 --> 1:54:54.880\n this is a very, very, very, very, very intentional thing\n\n1:54:54.880 --> 1:54:55.800\n that is happening,\n\n1:54:55.800 --> 1:54:58.000\n which is that the Times talking\n\n1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.320\n about unfettered conversations,\n\n1:55:00.320 --> 1:55:03.120\n that's happening on Clubhouse for people who aren't aware.\n\n1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:06.280\n This is important because they need\n\n1:55:06.280 --> 1:55:08.880\n to be the fetters of conversation.\n\n1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:11.600\n They need to be the inter agent.\n\n1:55:11.600 --> 1:55:12.760\n That's where they get their power.\n\n1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:15.520\n They get their power from convincing Facebook\n\n1:55:15.520 --> 1:55:18.480\n that they are the ones who can fact check stuff.\n\n1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:20.760\n They are the ones who can tell you\n\n1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:23.160\n whether something is right or wrong.\n\n1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:27.120\n That battle over unimpeded conversation\n\n1:55:27.120 --> 1:55:28.640\n and the explosion of a format\n\n1:55:28.640 --> 1:55:30.400\n that you and I are doing really well in,\n\n1:55:30.400 --> 1:55:32.680\n and then this more consolidated one,\n\n1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:35.280\n which holds cultural power and elite power\n\n1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:37.240\n and more importantly, money, right?\n\n1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:39.240\n Over you and I, that's the battle\n\n1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:40.080\n that we're all gonna play out.\n\n1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:41.800\n Do you think unfettered conversations\n\n1:55:41.800 --> 1:55:43.640\n have a chance to win this battle?\n\n1:55:43.640 --> 1:55:45.360\n Yes, I do in the long run.\n\n1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:48.440\n In the long run, the internet is simply too powerful.\n\n1:55:48.440 --> 1:55:50.720\n But here's the mistake everybody makes.\n\n1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:52.200\n The New York Times will never lose.\n\n1:55:52.200 --> 1:55:53.740\n It will just become one of us.\n\n1:55:53.740 --> 1:55:54.580\n See.\n\n1:55:54.580 --> 1:55:55.400\n You think so?\n\n1:55:55.400 --> 1:55:56.240\n They already are.\n\n1:55:56.240 --> 1:55:57.080\n They are the largest.\n\n1:55:57.080 --> 1:55:57.900\n The daily?\n\n1:55:57.900 --> 1:55:58.760\n The daily, look at the daily.\n\n1:55:58.760 --> 1:55:59.640\n Not even that.\n\n1:55:59.640 --> 1:56:01.200\n Think about it not in podcasting.\n\n1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:04.720\n The Times is not a mass media product.\n\n1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:06.960\n It is a subscription product\n\n1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:10.080\n for upper middle class largely white liberals\n\n1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:12.800\n who live the same circumstances\n\n1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:15.400\n across the United States and in Europe.\n\n1:56:15.400 --> 1:56:16.880\n There's nothing wrong with that.\n\n1:56:16.880 --> 1:56:17.880\n But here's the thing.\n\n1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:19.660\n You can't be the paper of record\n\n1:56:19.660 --> 1:56:21.560\n when you're actually the paper\n\n1:56:21.560 --> 1:56:23.520\n of upper middle class white America.\n\n1:56:23.520 --> 1:56:27.000\n Your job is to report on the news from that angle\n\n1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:29.040\n and deliver them the product that they want.\n\n1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:30.540\n There's nothing wrong with that.\n\n1:56:30.540 --> 1:56:32.560\n Their stock price is higher than ever.\n\n1:56:32.560 --> 1:56:35.000\n They're making 10 times more money than they did\n\n1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:38.580\n 10 years ago, but it comes at the cost\n\n1:56:38.580 --> 1:56:41.520\n of not having a mass application audience.\n\n1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:44.200\n So like when people, I think people in our space\n\n1:56:44.200 --> 1:56:46.280\n are always like, the New York Times is gonna be destroyed.\n\n1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:48.640\n No, it's actually even better.\n\n1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:50.560\n They will just become one of us.\n\n1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:51.480\n They already are.\n\n1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:53.080\n They're a subscription platform.\n\n1:56:53.080 --> 1:56:54.880\n Well, yes, in terms of the actual mechanism.\n\n1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:58.000\n But you know, New York Times is still,\n\n1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:00.400\n and I don't think I'm speaking about a particular sector.\n\n1:57:00.400 --> 1:57:05.400\n I think it, as a brand, it does have the level\n\n1:57:06.020 --> 1:57:08.680\n of credibility assigned to it still.\n\n1:57:08.680 --> 1:57:10.600\n There's politicization of it.\n\n1:57:10.600 --> 1:57:11.440\n Totally.\n\n1:57:11.440 --> 1:57:13.740\n But there's a credibility.\n\n1:57:13.740 --> 1:57:16.480\n Like it has much more credibility than,\n\n1:57:16.480 --> 1:57:18.800\n forgive me, than I think you and I have.\n\n1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:19.640\n No, you're right.\n\n1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:23.480\n In terms of your podcast, like people are not going\n\n1:57:23.480 --> 1:57:27.800\n to be like, they're gonna say at the New York Times\n\n1:57:27.800 --> 1:57:32.800\n versus what you said on the podcast for an opinion.\n\n1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:35.320\n I wonder in the sense of battles,\n\n1:57:35.320 --> 1:57:37.800\n whether on Federated Conversations, whether Joe Rogan,\n\n1:57:37.800 --> 1:57:41.840\n whether your podcast can become the,\n\n1:57:41.840 --> 1:57:45.280\n have the same level of legitimacy or the flip side,\n\n1:57:45.280 --> 1:57:49.640\n New York Times loses legitimacy to be at the same level\n\n1:57:49.640 --> 1:57:52.640\n of in terms of how we talk about it.\n\n1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:54.480\n It's a long battle, right?\n\n1:57:54.480 --> 1:57:55.880\n It's gonna take a long time.\n\n1:57:55.880 --> 1:57:58.240\n And I'm saying, this is where I think the end state is going\n\n1:57:58.240 --> 1:57:59.520\n and look at what the Times is doing.\n\n1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:01.960\n They're leaning into podcasting for a reason,\n\n1:58:01.960 --> 1:58:06.160\n but not just podcasting as in NPR level,\n\n1:58:06.160 --> 1:58:07.700\n like here's what's happening.\n\n1:58:07.700 --> 1:58:10.320\n Michael Barbaro is a fucking celebrity, right?\n\n1:58:10.320 --> 1:58:11.720\n The guy who does the daily.\n\n1:58:11.720 --> 1:58:14.900\n That guy's famous amongst these people\n\n1:58:14.900 --> 1:58:16.840\n because they're like, oh my God, I love Michael.\n\n1:58:16.840 --> 1:58:18.200\n Like, I love the way he does this stuff.\n\n1:58:18.200 --> 1:58:19.360\n Again, that's fine.\n\n1:58:19.360 --> 1:58:20.680\n More people are listening to the news.\n\n1:58:20.680 --> 1:58:22.160\n I think that's a good thing.\n\n1:58:22.160 --> 1:58:23.680\n And then who else do they hire?\n\n1:58:23.680 --> 1:58:27.520\n Ezra Klein from Vox, Kara Swisher, also from Vox,\n\n1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:30.360\n who does Pivot, which is an amazing podcast.\n\n1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:32.640\n Or Jane Coaston, same thing.\n\n1:58:32.640 --> 1:58:36.280\n It's personalities who are becoming bundled together\n\n1:58:36.280 --> 1:58:38.200\n within this brand, right?\n\n1:58:38.200 --> 1:58:40.880\n Here's, okay, maybe I'm just a hater.\n\n1:58:42.760 --> 1:58:45.240\n Cause I love podcasting from the beginning.\n\n1:58:45.240 --> 1:58:48.420\n I love Green Day before the recall, man.\n\n1:58:48.420 --> 1:58:50.580\n But I am bothered by it.\n\n1:58:50.580 --> 1:58:53.400\n Like why doesn't Kara Swisher, she's done successfully.\n\n1:58:53.400 --> 1:58:55.600\n I think in her own, no, she was always a part\n\n1:58:55.600 --> 1:58:56.680\n of some kind of institution.\n\n1:58:56.680 --> 1:58:57.600\n I'm not sure.\n\n1:58:57.600 --> 1:59:00.080\n But she started her own thing, I think.\n\n1:59:00.080 --> 1:59:00.920\n It would.\n\n1:59:00.920 --> 1:59:01.920\n Recode, right, yeah.\n\n1:59:01.920 --> 1:59:03.520\n Recode, I don't know if that's her own thing.\n\n1:59:03.520 --> 1:59:04.360\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:59:04.360 --> 1:59:06.200\n So she was very successful there.\n\n1:59:06.200 --> 1:59:08.780\n Why the hell did she join the New York Times\n\n1:59:08.780 --> 1:59:09.920\n with the new podcast?\n\n1:59:09.920 --> 1:59:13.120\n Why is Michael Barbaro not do his own thing?\n\n1:59:13.120 --> 1:59:14.920\n Cause he gets paid and because he has,\n\n1:59:14.920 --> 1:59:17.800\n he wants the elite cache that you just referenced\n\n1:59:17.800 --> 1:59:19.880\n within his social circle in New York,\n\n1:59:19.880 --> 1:59:21.960\n which is that I think the biggest mistake\n\n1:59:21.960 --> 1:59:23.880\n that some of the venture people make is\n\n1:59:23.880 --> 1:59:25.780\n if we give everybody the tools\n\n1:59:25.780 --> 1:59:27.600\n that those people are all gonna leave\n\n1:59:27.600 --> 1:59:29.660\n to like go substack and go independent,\n\n1:59:29.660 --> 1:59:31.440\n within their social circle,\n\n1:59:31.440 --> 1:59:35.600\n sacrificing some money from being independent is worth it\n\n1:59:35.600 --> 1:59:38.060\n to be a part of the New York Times.\n\n1:59:38.060 --> 1:59:43.060\n That's sad to me because it propagates old thinking,\n\n1:59:43.140 --> 1:59:46.400\n like it propagates old institutions.\n\n1:59:46.400 --> 1:59:47.800\n And you could say that New York Times\n\n1:59:47.800 --> 1:59:49.700\n is going to evolve quickly and so on,\n\n1:59:49.700 --> 1:59:54.200\n but I would love it if there was a mechanism\n\n1:59:54.200 --> 1:59:57.360\n for reestablishing, like for building new New York Times\n\n1:59:58.360 --> 1:59:59.960\n in terms of public legitimacy.\n\n1:59:59.960 --> 2:00:02.320\n And I suppose that's a wishful thinking\n\n2:00:02.320 --> 2:00:06.360\n cause it takes time to build trust in institutions\n\n2:00:06.360 --> 2:00:08.440\n and it takes time to build new institutions.\n\n2:00:08.440 --> 2:00:10.560\n My main thing I would say is public legitimacy\n\n2:00:10.560 --> 2:00:13.220\n as a concept is not gonna be there in mass media anymore\n\n2:00:13.220 --> 2:00:15.960\n because of the balkanization of audiences.\n\n2:00:15.960 --> 2:00:16.920\n I mean, think about it, right?\n\n2:00:16.920 --> 2:00:20.320\n Like this is like Lesion, the classic stuff\n\n2:00:20.320 --> 2:00:21.920\n around a thousand true fans,\n\n2:00:21.920 --> 2:00:24.500\n or no, sorry, like a hundred true fans even now.\n\n2:00:24.500 --> 2:00:26.000\n Like you can make a living on the internet\n\n2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:27.600\n just talking to a hundred people.\n\n2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:29.400\n If as long as they're all high frequency traders,\n\n2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:32.480\n some of the highest paid people on substack,\n\n2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:34.240\n they don't have that many subs.\n\n2:00:34.240 --> 2:00:36.080\n It's just that they're Wall Street guys, right?\n\n2:00:36.080 --> 2:00:37.160\n So people pay a lot of money.\n\n2:00:37.160 --> 2:00:38.640\n Again, that's great.\n\n2:00:38.640 --> 2:00:42.060\n So what you will have is an increasing balkanization\n\n2:00:42.060 --> 2:00:46.120\n of the internet, of audiences and of niches.\n\n2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:48.680\n People will become increasingly famous within us.\n\n2:00:48.680 --> 2:00:51.040\n You will become astoundingly famous.\n\n2:00:51.040 --> 2:00:52.480\n I'm sure you've noticed this with your fan base.\n\n2:00:52.480 --> 2:00:53.400\n I certainly have with mine.\n\n2:00:53.400 --> 2:00:56.040\n Like 99% of people have no idea who I am,\n\n2:00:56.040 --> 2:00:57.000\n but when somebody meets, they're like,\n\n2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:01.080\n oh my God, I watch your show every day, right?\n\n2:01:01.080 --> 2:01:04.100\n Like it's the only thing I watch for news, right?\n\n2:01:04.100 --> 2:01:07.000\n Like instead of casually famous, if that makes sense,\n\n2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:09.400\n but like, oh yeah, it's like Alec Baldwin, you know?\n\n2:01:09.400 --> 2:01:10.640\n Whoa, shit, that's Alec Baldwin.\n\n2:01:10.640 --> 2:01:14.240\n But you're not like, oh shit, I love you Alec Baldwin.\n\n2:01:14.240 --> 2:01:16.840\n This is a Ben Smith of the New York Times,\n\n2:01:16.840 --> 2:01:17.800\n actually he wrote this column.\n\n2:01:17.800 --> 2:01:20.180\n He's like, the future is everybody will be famous,\n\n2:01:20.180 --> 2:01:22.760\n but only to a small group of people.\n\n2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:24.160\n And I think that is true.\n\n2:01:24.160 --> 2:01:26.120\n But again, I don't decry it.\n\n2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:28.440\n I think it's great because I think that the more\n\n2:01:28.440 --> 2:01:31.000\n that that happens, the more engaged people will be\n\n2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:34.560\n and it empowers different voices to be able to come in\n\n2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:36.520\n and then possibly, I wouldn't say destroy,\n\n2:01:36.520 --> 2:01:37.960\n but compete against.\n\n2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:39.200\n I mean, look at Joe.\n\n2:01:39.200 --> 2:01:44.040\n Joe is more powerful than CNN and MSNBC and Fox\n\n2:01:44.040 --> 2:01:45.100\n all put together.\n\n2:01:45.100 --> 2:01:47.560\n That gives me like immense inspiration.\n\n2:01:47.560 --> 2:01:50.040\n Like he created the space for me to succeed.\n\n2:01:50.040 --> 2:01:52.360\n And I told him that when I met him, I was like,\n\n2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:55.480\n dude, like I listened to his podcast when I was like young.\n\n2:01:55.480 --> 2:01:58.020\n And like, and I remember like when I got to meet him\n\n2:01:58.020 --> 2:02:00.280\n and all that, and I told him this on this pod,\n\n2:02:00.280 --> 2:02:02.840\n I was like, I didn't know people were millions\n\n2:02:02.840 --> 2:02:05.380\n were willing to listen to a guy talk about chimps\n\n2:02:05.380 --> 2:02:08.080\n for three straight hours, including me.\n\n2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:09.760\n I didn't know that I could be one of those people.\n\n2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:10.600\n Yeah, me too.\n\n2:02:10.600 --> 2:02:12.760\n I learned something about myself from his show, yeah.\n\n2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:16.000\n And so by creating that space, I'd be like, wait,\n\n2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:17.460\n there's a hunger here.\n\n2:02:17.460 --> 2:02:20.240\n Like he showed us all the way\n\n2:02:20.240 --> 2:02:22.400\n and none of us will ever again be as famous as Rogan\n\n2:02:22.400 --> 2:02:24.680\n because he was the first and that's fine\n\n2:02:24.680 --> 2:02:27.460\n because he created the umbrella ecosystem\n\n2:02:27.460 --> 2:02:29.100\n for us all to thrive.\n\n2:02:29.100 --> 2:02:32.400\n That is where I see like a great amount of hope\n\n2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:33.420\n within that story.\n\n2:02:33.420 --> 2:02:35.880\n Yeah, and the cool thing, he also supports that ecosystem.\n\n2:02:35.880 --> 2:02:38.160\n He's such a. He's so generous.\n\n2:02:38.160 --> 2:02:40.960\n One of the things he paved the way out for me\n\n2:02:40.960 --> 2:02:45.960\n is to show that you can just be honest, publicly honest,\n\n2:02:47.420 --> 2:02:51.320\n and not jealous of other people's success,\n\n2:02:51.320 --> 2:02:54.620\n but instead be supportive and all those kinds of things,\n\n2:02:54.620 --> 2:02:56.140\n just like loving towards others.\n\n2:02:56.140 --> 2:02:57.360\n He's been an inspiration.\n\n2:02:57.360 --> 2:03:01.280\n I mean, to the comics community,\n\n2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:04.520\n I think there are a bunch of, before that,\n\n2:03:04.520 --> 2:03:06.920\n I think there were all a bunch of competitive haters\n\n2:03:06.920 --> 2:03:07.760\n towards each other.\n\n2:03:07.760 --> 2:03:11.240\n Yeah, and now he's like just injected love.\n\n2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:13.600\n They're like, they're still like many are still resistant,\n\n2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:15.080\n but they're like, they can't help it\n\n2:03:15.080 --> 2:03:17.120\n because he's such a huge voice.\n\n2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:20.160\n He like forces them to be like loving towards each other.\n\n2:03:20.160 --> 2:03:22.420\n And the same, I tried to,\n\n2:03:22.420 --> 2:03:26.160\n one of the reasons I wanted to start this podcast\n\n2:03:26.160 --> 2:03:31.160\n was to try to, I wanted to be like do what Joe Rogan did,\n\n2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:33.920\n but for the scientific community,\n\n2:03:33.920 --> 2:03:37.000\n like my little circle of scientific community of like,\n\n2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:38.580\n like let's support each other.\n\n2:03:38.580 --> 2:03:40.360\n Yeah, well, like Avi Loeb,\n\n2:03:40.360 --> 2:03:42.880\n I would have no idea who he was if it wasn't for you.\n\n2:03:42.880 --> 2:03:44.880\n I mean, I assume you put him in touch with Joe.\n\n2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:45.720\n He went on Joe's show.\n\n2:03:45.720 --> 2:03:46.960\n I had him on my show.\n\n2:03:46.960 --> 2:03:49.520\n Like millions of people would have no idea who he was\n\n2:03:49.520 --> 2:03:50.360\n if it wasn't for you.\n\n2:03:50.360 --> 2:03:51.960\n Just by the way, in terms of deep state\n\n2:03:51.960 --> 2:03:54.760\n and shadow government, Avi Loeb has to do with aliens.\n\n2:03:54.760 --> 2:03:56.760\n You better believe Joe.\n\n2:03:56.760 --> 2:03:58.400\n Dude, the last thing I sent to him\n\n2:03:58.400 --> 2:04:00.500\n was the American Airlines audio.\n\n2:04:00.500 --> 2:04:02.120\n Did you see that?\n\n2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:04.960\n The pilots who were, oh my God, dude, this is amazing.\n\n2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:09.240\n So like, this American Airlines flight crew\n\n2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:12.240\n was over New Mexico, this happened five or six days ago.\n\n2:04:12.240 --> 2:04:14.400\n And the guy comes and he goes,\n\n2:04:14.400 --> 2:04:16.320\n hey, do you have any targets up here?\n\n2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:20.560\n A large cylindrical object just flew over me.\n\n2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:23.200\n Okay, so this happens, so this happens.\n\n2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:26.520\n Then a guy or like a radio catcher\n\n2:04:26.520 --> 2:04:28.960\n records this and posts it online.\n\n2:04:28.960 --> 2:04:33.440\n American Airlines confirms that this is authentic audio.\n\n2:04:33.440 --> 2:04:35.400\n And they go, all further questions\n\n2:04:35.400 --> 2:04:37.120\n should be referred to the FBI.\n\n2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:39.760\n So then, okay, American Airlines just confirmed\n\n2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:41.520\n it's a legitimate transmission.\n\n2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:45.760\n FBI, then the FAA comes out and says,\n\n2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:50.760\n we were tracking no objects in the vicinity of this plane\n\n2:04:51.040 --> 2:04:52.480\n at the time of the transmission.\n\n2:04:52.480 --> 2:04:55.480\n So the only plausible explanation that online sleuths\n\n2:04:55.480 --> 2:04:58.840\n have been able to say is maybe he saw a Learjet,\n\n2:04:58.840 --> 2:05:02.200\n which was, you know, using like open source data.\n\n2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:03.960\n FAA rules that out.\n\n2:05:03.960 --> 2:05:05.280\n So what was it?\n\n2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:07.380\n He saw a large cylindrical object.\n\n2:05:07.380 --> 2:05:09.680\n While he was mid flight, American Airlines,\n\n2:05:09.680 --> 2:05:12.960\n but you can go online, listen to the audio yourself.\n\n2:05:12.960 --> 2:05:15.680\n This is a 100% no shit transmission\n\n2:05:15.680 --> 2:05:19.820\n confirmed by American Airlines of a commercial pilot\n\n2:05:19.820 --> 2:05:23.200\n over New Mexico, seeing a quote unquote,\n\n2:05:23.200 --> 2:05:26.040\n large cylindrical object in the air.\n\n2:05:26.040 --> 2:05:28.200\n Like I said, when we first started talking,\n\n2:05:28.200 --> 2:05:31.160\n I've never believed more in UFOs and aliens.\n\n2:05:31.160 --> 2:05:33.200\n Yeah, this is awesome.\n\n2:05:33.200 --> 2:05:37.520\n I just wish both American Airlines, FBI,\n\n2:05:37.520 --> 2:05:40.000\n and government would be more transparent.\n\n2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:43.280\n Like there would be voices, and I know it sounds ridiculous,\n\n2:05:43.280 --> 2:05:45.280\n but the kind of transparency that you see,\n\n2:05:45.280 --> 2:05:48.920\n maybe not Joe Rogan, he's like overly transparent.\n\n2:05:48.920 --> 2:05:52.440\n He's just a comic really, but just the, I don't know,\n\n2:05:52.440 --> 2:05:56.480\n like a podcast from the FBI, just like being honest,\n\n2:05:56.480 --> 2:05:58.980\n like excited, confused.\n\n2:05:58.980 --> 2:06:03.120\n I'm sure that they're being overly cautious\n\n2:06:03.120 --> 2:06:04.520\n about their release information.\n\n2:06:04.520 --> 2:06:05.960\n I'm sure there's a lot of information\n\n2:06:05.960 --> 2:06:07.560\n that would inspire the public,\n\n2:06:07.560 --> 2:06:09.500\n that would inspire trust in institutions\n\n2:06:09.500 --> 2:06:12.320\n that will not damage national security.\n\n2:06:12.320 --> 2:06:14.240\n Like it seems to me obvious,\n\n2:06:14.240 --> 2:06:15.480\n and the reason they're not sharing it\n\n2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:17.800\n is because of this momentum of bureaucracy,\n\n2:06:17.800 --> 2:06:19.380\n of caution and so on.\n\n2:06:19.380 --> 2:06:21.560\n But there's probably so much cool information\n\n2:06:21.560 --> 2:06:22.720\n that the government has.\n\n2:06:22.720 --> 2:06:26.620\n The way I almost, I wouldn't say it confirmed it's real,\n\n2:06:26.620 --> 2:06:28.960\n but Trump didn't declassify it.\n\n2:06:28.960 --> 2:06:31.320\n Like you know that if there was ever a president\n\n2:06:31.320 --> 2:06:34.800\n that actually wanted to get to the bottom of it, it was him.\n\n2:06:34.800 --> 2:06:37.120\n I mean, he didn't declassify it, man.\n\n2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:38.400\n And people begged him to.\n\n2:06:38.400 --> 2:06:39.720\n I know for a fact,\n\n2:06:39.720 --> 2:06:41.960\n because I pushed to try and make this happen,\n\n2:06:41.960 --> 2:06:44.360\n that some people did speak to him about it.\n\n2:06:44.360 --> 2:06:46.400\n And he was like, no, I'm not gonna do it.\n\n2:06:46.400 --> 2:06:47.240\n So.\n\n2:06:47.240 --> 2:06:48.560\n He might be afraid.\n\n2:06:48.560 --> 2:06:49.720\n That's what I mean, though.\n\n2:06:49.720 --> 2:06:50.640\n They were probably all telling him,\n\n2:06:50.640 --> 2:06:52.480\n they're like, sir, you can't do this, you know, all this,\n\n2:06:52.480 --> 2:06:53.780\n like, wow, and I get that.\n\n2:06:53.780 --> 2:06:56.400\n And there's this legislation written at COVID\n\n2:06:56.400 --> 2:06:58.640\n that like they have six months to release it, man.\n\n2:06:58.640 --> 2:06:59.480\n Is that real?\n\n2:06:59.480 --> 2:07:00.320\n What is that?\n\n2:07:00.320 --> 2:07:01.140\n Is that a bunch of bullshit?\n\n2:07:01.140 --> 2:07:01.980\n I think it's bullshit.\n\n2:07:01.980 --> 2:07:04.280\n There's so many different levels of classification\n\n2:07:04.280 --> 2:07:05.840\n that people need to understand.\n\n2:07:05.840 --> 2:07:07.960\n I mean, look, I read John Podesta.\n\n2:07:07.960 --> 2:07:10.320\n He was the chief of staff to Bill Clinton.\n\n2:07:10.320 --> 2:07:11.560\n He's a big UFO guy.\n\n2:07:11.560 --> 2:07:12.960\n He tried.\n\n2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:15.920\n Like him and Clinton tried to get some of this information\n\n2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:17.880\n and they could not get any of it.\n\n2:07:17.880 --> 2:07:19.680\n And we're talking about the president\n\n2:07:19.680 --> 2:07:21.340\n and the White House chief of staff.\n\n2:07:21.340 --> 2:07:22.560\n Well, there's a whole bureaucracy,\n\n2:07:22.560 --> 2:07:24.640\n but just like you were saying, with intent.\n\n2:07:24.640 --> 2:07:27.080\n You have to be like, that has to be your focus\n\n2:07:27.080 --> 2:07:29.840\n because there's a whole bureaucracy built around secrecy\n\n2:07:29.840 --> 2:07:31.160\n for probably for a good reason.\n\n2:07:31.160 --> 2:07:33.740\n So to get through to the information,\n\n2:07:33.740 --> 2:07:35.440\n there's a whole like paperwork process,\n\n2:07:35.440 --> 2:07:36.280\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:07:36.280 --> 2:07:37.880\n You can't just walk in and get the,\n\n2:07:37.880 --> 2:07:40.960\n unless again, with intention, that becomes your thing.\n\n2:07:40.960 --> 2:07:43.040\n Like let's revolutionize this thing.\n\n2:07:43.960 --> 2:07:45.920\n And then you get only so many things.\n\n2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:50.800\n It's sad that the bureaucracy has gotten so bulky,\n\n2:07:50.800 --> 2:07:53.040\n but I think the hopeful messages\n\n2:07:53.040 --> 2:07:54.400\n from earlier in our conversation,\n\n2:07:54.400 --> 2:07:57.760\n it seems like a single person can't fix it,\n\n2:07:57.760 --> 2:08:01.960\n but if you hire the right team, it feels like you can.\n\n2:08:01.960 --> 2:08:03.000\n Can't fix everything.\n\n2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:05.540\n I don't wanna give people unrealistic expectations.\n\n2:08:05.540 --> 2:08:07.940\n You can fix a lot, especially in crisis,\n\n2:08:07.940 --> 2:08:09.200\n you can remake America.\n\n2:08:09.200 --> 2:08:10.040\n Yeah.\n\n2:08:10.040 --> 2:08:10.860\n And the reason I know that\n\n2:08:10.860 --> 2:08:12.560\n is because it's already happened twice.\n\n2:08:12.560 --> 2:08:17.400\n FDR, or in modern history, FDR and JFK.\n\n2:08:17.400 --> 2:08:20.880\n Sorry, FDR and JFK's assassination, LBJ.\n\n2:08:20.880 --> 2:08:25.480\n Two hyper competent men who understood government,\n\n2:08:25.480 --> 2:08:27.120\n who understood personnel,\n\n2:08:27.120 --> 2:08:28.440\n and coincidentally were friends.\n\n2:08:28.440 --> 2:08:29.280\n I love this.\n\n2:08:29.280 --> 2:08:31.000\n I don't think actually people understand this.\n\n2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:36.000\n FDR met Johnson three days after he won his election\n\n2:08:37.520 --> 2:08:38.560\n to Congress, special election.\n\n2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:40.300\n He was only 29 years old.\n\n2:08:40.300 --> 2:08:44.220\n And he left that meeting and called somebody and said,\n\n2:08:44.220 --> 2:08:45.640\n this young man is gonna be president\n\n2:08:45.640 --> 2:08:46.920\n of the United States someday.\n\n2:08:46.920 --> 2:08:50.080\n Like even then, like what was within him\n\n2:08:50.080 --> 2:08:51.800\n to understand and to recognize that.\n\n2:08:51.800 --> 2:08:54.360\n And sometimes Johnson, as a young member of Congress,\n\n2:08:54.360 --> 2:08:56.280\n would come and have breakfast with FDR,\n\n2:08:56.280 --> 2:09:00.080\n like just to the great political minds of the 20th century,\n\n2:09:00.080 --> 2:09:01.320\n just sitting there talking.\n\n2:09:01.320 --> 2:09:04.720\n Like I would give anything to know what was happening.\n\n2:09:04.720 --> 2:09:06.320\n Yeah, I hope they were real with each other.\n\n2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:08.480\n And there was like a genuine human connection, right?\n\n2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:09.960\n That seems to be the...\n\n2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:11.400\n Well, Johnson wasn't a genuine guy,\n\n2:09:11.400 --> 2:09:13.540\n so probably certainly not.\n\n2:09:13.540 --> 2:09:16.460\n Well, I need to read those thousands of pages.\n\n2:09:16.460 --> 2:09:19.700\n I've been way too focused on Hitler.\n\n2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:22.880\n I was gonna say, one of my goals in coming to this\n\n2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:24.560\n is I was like, I gotta get Lex into two things,\n\n2:09:24.560 --> 2:09:25.600\n because I know he'll love it.\n\n2:09:25.600 --> 2:09:27.320\n I know he'll love LBJ,\n\n2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:29.240\n if he takes the time to read the books.\n\n2:09:29.240 --> 2:09:30.080\n Really?\n\n2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:31.160\n 100%.\n\n2:09:31.160 --> 2:09:32.000\n He's the most...\n\n2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:32.820\n Of all the presidents...\n\n2:09:32.820 --> 2:09:33.680\n I didn't say you'll love him,\n\n2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:34.960\n but you'll love the books about him.\n\n2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:37.520\n Because the books are a story of America,\n\n2:09:37.520 --> 2:09:39.600\n the story of politics, the story of power.\n\n2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:41.280\n This is the guy who wrote the Power Broker.\n\n2:09:41.280 --> 2:09:44.000\n These books are up there with\n\n2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:47.040\n Decline and Follow the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon,\n\n2:09:47.040 --> 2:09:48.840\n in terms of how power works.\n\n2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:49.780\n Study of power.\n\n2:09:49.780 --> 2:09:50.620\n Exactly.\n\n2:09:50.620 --> 2:09:52.880\n No, that's why Carroll wrote the books.\n\n2:09:52.880 --> 2:09:55.600\n And that's why the books are not really about LBJ,\n\n2:09:55.600 --> 2:09:57.560\n they're about power in Washington,\n\n2:09:57.560 --> 2:10:00.200\n and about the consolidation of power post New Deal,\n\n2:10:00.200 --> 2:10:01.760\n the consolidation then,\n\n2:10:01.760 --> 2:10:04.640\n where they're using the levers of power like Johnson knew\n\n2:10:04.640 --> 2:10:07.980\n in order to change the House of Representatives,\n\n2:10:07.980 --> 2:10:09.520\n the Senate of the United States,\n\n2:10:09.520 --> 2:10:11.480\n and ultimately the presidency of the United States,\n\n2:10:11.480 --> 2:10:13.920\n which ended in failure and disaster with Vietnam.\n\n2:10:13.920 --> 2:10:14.960\n Don't get me wrong.\n\n2:10:14.960 --> 2:10:18.860\n But he's overlooked for so many of the incredible things\n\n2:10:18.860 --> 2:10:19.960\n that he did with civil rights.\n\n2:10:19.960 --> 2:10:21.520\n Nobody else could have done it.\n\n2:10:21.520 --> 2:10:23.960\n No one else could have gotten it done.\n\n2:10:23.960 --> 2:10:25.320\n And the second thing is,\n\n2:10:25.320 --> 2:10:27.280\n we gotta get you into World War I.\n\n2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:29.640\n We gotta get you more into World War I,\n\n2:10:29.640 --> 2:10:31.860\n because I think that's a rabbit hole,\n\n2:10:31.860 --> 2:10:33.600\n which I know you're a Dan Carlin fan.\n\n2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:35.320\n So blueprint for Armageddon.\n\n2:10:35.320 --> 2:10:36.160\n Yeah, it's good.\n\n2:10:36.160 --> 2:10:36.980\n Guaranteed.\n\n2:10:36.980 --> 2:10:37.820\n But...\n\n2:10:37.820 --> 2:10:39.980\n But there's fewer evil people there.\n\n2:10:39.980 --> 2:10:41.560\n Yes, but...\n\n2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:43.720\n But that's what actually...\n\n2:10:43.720 --> 2:10:45.520\n There's a banality of that evil,\n\n2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:50.240\n of the Kaiser and of the Austro Hungarians.\n\n2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:51.120\n And of...\n\n2:10:51.120 --> 2:10:54.440\n See, I like World War I more because it was unresolved.\n\n2:10:54.440 --> 2:10:56.040\n It's one of those periods I was talking to you about,\n\n2:10:56.040 --> 2:10:58.840\n about sometimes you're called and you fail.\n\n2:10:58.840 --> 2:10:59.680\n That's what happened.\n\n2:10:59.680 --> 2:11:02.240\n I mean, 50 million people were killed\n\n2:11:02.240 --> 2:11:03.960\n in the most horrific way.\n\n2:11:03.960 --> 2:11:06.400\n People literally drowned in the mud,\n\n2:11:06.400 --> 2:11:09.220\n like an entire generation.\n\n2:11:09.220 --> 2:11:11.600\n One stat I love is that,\n\n2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:14.760\n Britain didn't need a draft till 1916.\n\n2:11:14.760 --> 2:11:18.000\n Like they went two years of throwing people\n\n2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:20.620\n into barbed wire voluntarily.\n\n2:11:20.620 --> 2:11:22.640\n And because people love their country\n\n2:11:22.640 --> 2:11:23.800\n and they love the king,\n\n2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:26.320\n and they thought they were going against the Kaiser.\n\n2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:28.480\n It's just like that conflict to me,\n\n2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:30.160\n I just can't read enough about it.\n\n2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:33.320\n Also just like births Russian Revolution, you know.\n\n2:11:33.320 --> 2:11:34.160\n Yeah, I mean...\n\n2:11:34.160 --> 2:11:35.000\n Hitler.\n\n2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.000\n You can't talk about World War II without World War I.\n\n2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:37.840\n Right.\n\n2:11:37.840 --> 2:11:39.200\n And I'm obsessed with the conflict.\n\n2:11:39.200 --> 2:11:40.800\n I've read way too many books about it.\n\n2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:42.880\n For this reason is, it's unresolved.\n\n2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:46.160\n And like the roots of so much of even our current problems\n\n2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:47.800\n are happened in Versailles, right?\n\n2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:51.720\n Like Vietnam is because of the Treaty of Versailles.\n\n2:11:51.720 --> 2:11:53.460\n Many ways the Middle Eastern problems\n\n2:11:53.460 --> 2:11:55.300\n and the division of the states there.\n\n2:11:55.300 --> 2:11:56.520\n The Treaty of Versailles\n\n2:11:56.520 --> 2:11:58.760\n in terms of the penalties against Germany.\n\n2:11:58.760 --> 2:12:01.780\n But also they fall out from those wars\n\n2:12:01.780 --> 2:12:03.900\n on the French and the German population,\n\n2:12:03.900 --> 2:12:05.360\n or the French and the British populations\n\n2:12:05.360 --> 2:12:10.240\n and their reluctance for war in 1939 or 1938.\n\n2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:12.320\n When Neville Chamberlain goes, right?\n\n2:12:12.320 --> 2:12:14.040\n Like that's one of the things people don't understand\n\n2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:16.500\n is the actual appetite of the British public at that time.\n\n2:12:16.500 --> 2:12:17.720\n They didn't want to go to war.\n\n2:12:17.720 --> 2:12:19.240\n Only Churchill, he was the only one\n\n2:12:19.240 --> 2:12:21.480\n in the gathering storm, right?\n\n2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:24.940\n Like being like, hey, this is really bad and all of that.\n\n2:12:24.940 --> 2:12:26.440\n And then even in the United States,\n\n2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:28.820\n our streak of isolationism, which sweat.\n\n2:12:28.820 --> 2:12:32.080\n I mean, things were because of that conflict.\n\n2:12:32.080 --> 2:12:34.720\n We were convinced as a country\n\n2:12:34.720 --> 2:12:37.960\n that we wanted nothing to do with Europe and its problems.\n\n2:12:37.960 --> 2:12:39.460\n And in many ways that contributed\n\n2:12:39.460 --> 2:12:41.280\n to the proliferation of Hitler and more.\n\n2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:43.940\n So like I'm obsessed with World War I for this reason,\n\n2:12:43.940 --> 2:12:46.040\n which is that it's just like the root.\n\n2:12:46.040 --> 2:12:48.620\n It's like the culmination of the monarchies,\n\n2:12:48.620 --> 2:12:52.080\n then the fall, and then just all the shit spills out\n\n2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:53.600\n from there for like a hundred years.\n\n2:12:53.600 --> 2:12:56.260\n So World War I is like the most important shift\n\n2:12:56.260 --> 2:12:58.680\n in human history versus World War II\n\n2:12:58.680 --> 2:13:00.400\n is like a consequence of that.\n\n2:13:00.400 --> 2:13:03.040\n Yeah, so I have a degree in security studies\n\n2:13:03.040 --> 2:13:03.880\n from Georgetown.\n\n2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:06.120\n And one of the thing is that we would focus a lot on that\n\n2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:11.080\n is like war and, but also like the complexity around war.\n\n2:13:11.080 --> 2:13:12.280\n And it's funny.\n\n2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:15.040\n We never spent that much time on World War II\n\n2:13:15.040 --> 2:13:17.420\n because it was actually quite of a clean war.\n\n2:13:17.420 --> 2:13:21.620\n It's a very atypical war as in the war object,\n\n2:13:21.620 --> 2:13:23.240\n which we learned from World War I\n\n2:13:23.240 --> 2:13:26.600\n is we must inflict suffering on the German people\n\n2:13:26.600 --> 2:13:30.520\n and invade the borders of Germany and destroy Hitler.\n\n2:13:30.520 --> 2:13:34.280\n Like the center of gravity is the Nazi regime and Hitler.\n\n2:13:34.280 --> 2:13:37.360\n So it had a very basic begin and end.\n\n2:13:37.360 --> 2:13:40.620\n Begin, liberate France, invade Germany,\n\n2:13:40.620 --> 2:13:44.020\n destroy Hitler, reoccupy, rebuild.\n\n2:13:44.020 --> 2:13:46.940\n World War I, what are you fighting for?\n\n2:13:46.940 --> 2:13:49.520\n Like, are you, I mean, and nobody even knew.\n\n2:13:49.520 --> 2:13:51.240\n You can go to the German general staff.\n\n2:13:51.240 --> 2:13:53.920\n They were like, even in 1917, they're like,\n\n2:13:53.920 --> 2:13:56.160\n the war was worth it because now we have Luxembourg.\n\n2:13:56.160 --> 2:13:57.000\n I'm like, really?\n\n2:13:57.000 --> 2:13:58.360\n Like you killed 2 million of your citizens\n\n2:13:58.360 --> 2:14:01.040\n for fucking Luxembourg and like half of Belgium,\n\n2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:02.640\n which is now like a pond.\n\n2:14:02.640 --> 2:14:04.960\n And same thing, the French are like,\n\n2:14:04.960 --> 2:14:07.480\n well, the French more so they're defending their borders,\n\n2:14:07.480 --> 2:14:09.480\n but like, what are the British fighting for?\n\n2:14:09.480 --> 2:14:11.520\n Why did hundreds of thousands of British people die?\n\n2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:14.320\n In order to preserve the balance of power in Europe\n\n2:14:14.320 --> 2:14:17.440\n and prevent the Kaiser from having a port\n\n2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:19.300\n on the English Channel?\n\n2:14:19.300 --> 2:14:21.440\n Like really, that's why?\n\n2:14:21.440 --> 2:14:24.400\n That's more what wars are is they become these like\n\n2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:29.400\n atypical, they become these protracted conflicts\n\n2:14:29.400 --> 2:14:33.240\n with a necessary diplomatic resolution.\n\n2:14:33.240 --> 2:14:36.240\n It's not clean, it's very dirty.\n\n2:14:36.240 --> 2:14:38.880\n It usually leads in the outbreak of another war\n\n2:14:38.880 --> 2:14:39.960\n and another war and another war\n\n2:14:39.960 --> 2:14:43.040\n and a slow burn of ethnic conflict, which bubbles up.\n\n2:14:43.040 --> 2:14:45.800\n So that's why I look at that one even,\n\n2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:49.040\n because it's more typical of warfare and how it works.\n\n2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:51.200\n Exactly, it's kind of interesting.\n\n2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:54.320\n You're making me realize that World War II\n\n2:14:54.320 --> 2:14:57.800\n is one of the rare wars where you can make a strong case\n\n2:14:57.800 --> 2:14:59.600\n for it's a fight of good versus evil.\n\n2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:01.120\n Yeah, just war theory, obviously.\n\n2:15:01.120 --> 2:15:02.840\n Like, yeah, they're literally slaughtering Jews.\n\n2:15:02.840 --> 2:15:04.280\n Like, we have to kill them.\n\n2:15:04.280 --> 2:15:05.800\n And there's one person doing it.\n\n2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:08.120\n I mean, there's one person at the core.\n\n2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:11.280\n Yeah, that's fascinating.\n\n2:15:11.280 --> 2:15:14.220\n And it's short and there's a clear aggression.\n\n2:15:15.620 --> 2:15:18.720\n It's interesting that Dan Carlin\n\n2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:20.980\n has been avoiding Hitler as well.\n\n2:15:20.980 --> 2:15:23.960\n Yeah, probably for this reason.\n\n2:15:23.960 --> 2:15:25.320\n Probably for this reason.\n\n2:15:25.320 --> 2:15:27.360\n I mean, but it's complicated too,\n\n2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:28.920\n because there's a pressure.\n\n2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:30.600\n That guy has his demons.\n\n2:15:30.600 --> 2:15:31.680\n I love Dan so much.\n\n2:15:31.680 --> 2:15:35.720\n So this is the, I don't know if you feel this pressure,\n\n2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:39.120\n but as a creative, he feels the pressure\n\n2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:42.980\n of being maybe not necessarily correct,\n\n2:15:43.900 --> 2:15:48.520\n but maybe correct in the sense that his understanding,\n\n2:15:48.520 --> 2:15:53.520\n he gets to the bottom of why something happened,\n\n2:15:53.520 --> 2:15:57.860\n of why something happened, of what really happened.\n\n2:15:57.860 --> 2:15:59.540\n Get to the bottom of it\n\n2:15:59.540 --> 2:16:02.540\n before he can say something publicly about it.\n\n2:16:02.540 --> 2:16:04.900\n And he is tortured by that burden.\n\n2:16:04.900 --> 2:16:06.980\n I know, you know, he takes so much shit\n\n2:16:06.980 --> 2:16:09.220\n from the historical community for no reason.\n\n2:16:09.220 --> 2:16:12.180\n I think he's the greatest popularizer, quote unquote,\n\n2:16:12.180 --> 2:16:13.340\n of history.\n\n2:16:13.340 --> 2:16:17.100\n And I wish more people in history understood it that way.\n\n2:16:17.100 --> 2:16:18.420\n He was an inspiration to me.\n\n2:16:18.420 --> 2:16:21.220\n I mean, I do some videos sometimes on my Instagram now\n\n2:16:21.220 --> 2:16:22.980\n where I'll do like a book tour.\n\n2:16:22.980 --> 2:16:24.680\n I'll be like, here's my bookshelf of these presidents.\n\n2:16:24.680 --> 2:16:26.140\n And like, here's what I learned from this book\n\n2:16:26.140 --> 2:16:26.980\n and this book and this.\n\n2:16:26.980 --> 2:16:30.700\n And that was very much like a skill I learned from him\n\n2:16:30.700 --> 2:16:33.940\n of being like, you know, as a historian writes.\n\n2:16:33.940 --> 2:16:35.900\n You know, I just love the way he talks.\n\n2:16:35.900 --> 2:16:38.180\n He's like, in the mud.\n\n2:16:38.180 --> 2:16:40.900\n I mean, you know, he'll be like, quote, quote.\n\n2:16:40.900 --> 2:16:44.660\n I just, I love, he inspires me, man.\n\n2:16:44.660 --> 2:16:46.660\n He really does to like learn more.\n\n2:16:46.660 --> 2:16:49.600\n And I've read, I bought a lot of books because of Dan Carlin.\n\n2:16:49.600 --> 2:16:50.940\n He'll be, you know, because of this guy,\n\n2:16:50.940 --> 2:16:53.260\n because of that guy, in terms of, you know,\n\n2:16:53.260 --> 2:16:54.940\n another thing he does, which nobody else,\n\n2:16:54.940 --> 2:16:56.220\n and I'm probably guilty of this,\n\n2:16:56.220 --> 2:16:59.420\n he focuses on the actual people involved.\n\n2:16:59.420 --> 2:17:03.300\n Like he would tell the story of actual British soldiers\n\n2:17:03.300 --> 2:17:04.560\n in World War I.\n\n2:17:04.560 --> 2:17:07.100\n And I probably, and maybe you're guilty of this too,\n\n2:17:07.100 --> 2:17:09.740\n we over focus on what was happening\n\n2:17:09.740 --> 2:17:11.020\n in the German general staff,\n\n2:17:11.020 --> 2:17:12.760\n what was happening in the British general staff.\n\n2:17:12.760 --> 2:17:14.220\n And he doesn't make that mistake.\n\n2:17:14.220 --> 2:17:16.100\n That's why he tells real history.\n\n2:17:16.100 --> 2:17:18.740\n Yeah, and it gives it a feeling.\n\n2:17:18.740 --> 2:17:20.540\n The result is that there's a feeling,\n\n2:17:20.540 --> 2:17:22.940\n you get the feeling of what it was like to be there.\n\n2:17:22.940 --> 2:17:24.300\n Exactly.\n\n2:17:24.300 --> 2:17:25.960\n You know, you're becoming,\n\n2:17:25.960 --> 2:17:28.140\n quickly becoming more and more popular.\n\n2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:32.940\n Speaking about political issues in part,\n\n2:17:34.100 --> 2:17:38.540\n do you feel a burden, like almost like\n\n2:17:39.540 --> 2:17:43.660\n the prison of your prior convictions\n\n2:17:43.660 --> 2:17:47.660\n of having to, being popular with a certain kind of audience\n\n2:17:47.660 --> 2:17:51.380\n and thereby unable to really think outside the box?\n\n2:17:51.380 --> 2:17:54.440\n I had, I've really struggled with this.\n\n2:17:54.440 --> 2:17:56.380\n I came up in right wing media.\n\n2:17:56.380 --> 2:18:01.060\n I came up a much more doctrinaire conservative\n\n2:18:01.060 --> 2:18:02.100\n in my professional life.\n\n2:18:02.100 --> 2:18:02.980\n I wasn't always conservative.\n\n2:18:02.980 --> 2:18:05.220\n We can get to that later if you want.\n\n2:18:05.220 --> 2:18:10.220\n And I did feel an immense pressure after the election\n\n2:18:13.240 --> 2:18:17.580\n by people to say, wanted me to say the election was stolen.\n\n2:18:17.580 --> 2:18:21.620\n And I knew that I had a sizable part of my audience.\n\n2:18:21.620 --> 2:18:22.780\n Oh, well, here's the benefit.\n\n2:18:22.780 --> 2:18:24.220\n Most people know me from Rising,\n\n2:18:24.220 --> 2:18:26.180\n which is with Crystal and me.\n\n2:18:26.180 --> 2:18:29.400\n That is inherently a left right program.\n\n2:18:29.400 --> 2:18:31.220\n So it's a large audience.\n\n2:18:31.220 --> 2:18:35.500\n So I felt comfortable and I knew that I could still be fine\n\n2:18:35.500 --> 2:18:37.280\n in terms of my numbers, whatever,\n\n2:18:37.280 --> 2:18:40.260\n because a lot, many people knew me who were on the left.\n\n2:18:40.260 --> 2:18:41.500\n And if really, you know,\n\n2:18:41.500 --> 2:18:44.620\n my right listeners abandoned me, so be it.\n\n2:18:44.620 --> 2:18:47.060\n I was, had the luxury of able to take that choice,\n\n2:18:47.060 --> 2:18:50.980\n but I still felt an immense amount of pressure\n\n2:18:50.980 --> 2:18:52.740\n to say the election was stolen,\n\n2:18:52.740 --> 2:18:55.480\n to give credence to a lot of the stuff that Trump was doing,\n\n2:18:55.480 --> 2:18:57.700\n to downplay January 6th,\n\n2:18:57.700 --> 2:19:00.060\n to downplay many of the Republican senators\n\n2:19:00.060 --> 2:19:01.860\n or justify many of the Republican senators,\n\n2:19:01.860 --> 2:19:04.100\n some of whom I know who objected\n\n2:19:04.100 --> 2:19:06.300\n to the electoral college certification\n\n2:19:06.300 --> 2:19:08.900\n and who stoked some of the flames\n\n2:19:08.900 --> 2:19:11.660\n that have eaten the Republican base.\n\n2:19:11.660 --> 2:19:13.540\n And I just wouldn't do it.\n\n2:19:13.540 --> 2:19:15.340\n And that was hard, man.\n\n2:19:15.340 --> 2:19:19.820\n Like I feel more politically homeless right now\n\n2:19:19.820 --> 2:19:21.620\n than I ever have,\n\n2:19:21.620 --> 2:19:24.620\n but I have realized in the last couple of months\n\n2:19:24.620 --> 2:19:26.280\n that's the best thing that ever happened to me.\n\n2:19:26.280 --> 2:19:27.120\n It's freedom.\n\n2:19:27.120 --> 2:19:28.580\n It's true freedom.\n\n2:19:28.580 --> 2:19:32.660\n I now, I say exactly what I think.\n\n2:19:32.660 --> 2:19:34.920\n And it's not that I wasn't doing that before.\n\n2:19:34.920 --> 2:19:38.120\n It's maybe I would avoid certain topics\n\n2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:40.660\n or like I would think about things\n\n2:19:40.660 --> 2:19:42.780\n more from a team perspective of like,\n\n2:19:42.780 --> 2:19:45.720\n am I making sure that, it's,\n\n2:19:45.720 --> 2:19:46.740\n I'm not saying I didn't fight it.\n\n2:19:46.740 --> 2:19:48.740\n And I still, I criticize the right plenty\n\n2:19:48.740 --> 2:19:51.420\n and Trump plenty before the election and more.\n\n2:19:51.420 --> 2:19:52.860\n It's more just like,\n\n2:19:52.860 --> 2:19:56.580\n I no longer feel as if I even have the illusion\n\n2:19:56.580 --> 2:19:58.580\n of a stake within the game.\n\n2:19:58.580 --> 2:20:02.380\n I'm like, I only look at myself as an outside observer\n\n2:20:02.380 --> 2:20:05.640\n and I will only call it as I see it truly.\n\n2:20:05.640 --> 2:20:08.380\n And I was aspiring to that before,\n\n2:20:08.380 --> 2:20:11.860\n but I had to have, in a way,\n\n2:20:11.860 --> 2:20:13.460\n Trump stop the steal thing.\n\n2:20:13.460 --> 2:20:16.140\n It like took my shackles off 100%.\n\n2:20:16.140 --> 2:20:17.640\n Cause I was like, no, this is bullshit.\n\n2:20:17.640 --> 2:20:18.940\n And I'm going to say it's bullshit.\n\n2:20:18.940 --> 2:20:20.200\n And I think it's bad.\n\n2:20:20.200 --> 2:20:22.380\n And I think it's bad for the Republican party.\n\n2:20:22.380 --> 2:20:24.140\n And if people in the Republican party\n\n2:20:24.140 --> 2:20:26.800\n don't agree with me on that, that's fine.\n\n2:20:26.800 --> 2:20:29.220\n I'm just not going to be necessarily like\n\n2:20:29.220 --> 2:20:30.900\n associated with you anymore.\n\n2:20:30.900 --> 2:20:32.740\n This is probably one of the first political\n\n2:20:32.740 --> 2:20:35.920\n liberal politics related conversations we've had.\n\n2:20:35.920 --> 2:20:38.740\n I mean, unless you count Michael Malice, who.\n\n2:20:38.740 --> 2:20:39.580\n He was great.\n\n2:20:39.580 --> 2:20:40.420\n Yeah.\n\n2:20:41.500 --> 2:20:42.500\n He's the funny guy.\n\n2:20:42.500 --> 2:20:46.320\n He's not so much political as he is like burning down, man.\n\n2:20:47.540 --> 2:20:49.980\n He leans too far in anarchy for me.\n\n2:20:49.980 --> 2:20:50.820\n Yeah.\n\n2:20:50.820 --> 2:20:51.640\n I think he's.\n\n2:20:51.640 --> 2:20:53.240\n There's a place for that.\n\n2:20:53.240 --> 2:20:54.940\n It's almost, well, first of all,\n\n2:20:54.940 --> 2:20:57.980\n he's working on a new book, which I really appreciate.\n\n2:20:57.980 --> 2:21:00.460\n Outside of the, he's working on like a big book\n\n2:21:00.460 --> 2:21:02.340\n for a while, which is White Pill.\n\n2:21:02.340 --> 2:21:07.100\n He's also working on this like short little thing,\n\n2:21:07.100 --> 2:21:11.660\n which is like anarchist handbook or something like that.\n\n2:21:11.660 --> 2:21:14.820\n It's like Anarchy for Idiots or something like that,\n\n2:21:14.820 --> 2:21:16.140\n which I think is really.\n\n2:21:19.040 --> 2:21:21.800\n Well, me being an idiot and being curious\n\n2:21:21.800 --> 2:21:23.460\n about anarchy seems useful.\n\n2:21:23.460 --> 2:21:24.660\n So I like those kinds of books.\n\n2:21:24.660 --> 2:21:26.420\n That's Russian heritage, man.\n\n2:21:26.420 --> 2:21:27.580\n Anarchist 101.\n\n2:21:29.700 --> 2:21:33.620\n I find those kinds of things a useful thought experiment\n\n2:21:33.620 --> 2:21:37.860\n because that's why it's frustrating to me\n\n2:21:37.860 --> 2:21:40.460\n when people talk about communism, socialism,\n\n2:21:40.460 --> 2:21:42.100\n or even capitalism,\n\n2:21:42.100 --> 2:21:44.780\n where they can't enjoy the thought experiment\n\n2:21:44.780 --> 2:21:49.780\n of like why did communism fail\n\n2:21:50.860 --> 2:21:53.300\n and maybe ask the question of like,\n\n2:21:53.300 --> 2:21:55.500\n is it possible to make communism succeed\n\n2:21:55.500 --> 2:21:57.380\n or are there good ideas in communism?\n\n2:21:57.380 --> 2:21:58.980\n Like I enjoy the thought experiment,\n\n2:21:58.980 --> 2:22:01.220\n like the discourse of it,\n\n2:22:01.220 --> 2:22:04.560\n like the reasoning and like devil's advocate and all that.\n\n2:22:04.560 --> 2:22:07.120\n People have like, seem to not have patience for that.\n\n2:22:07.120 --> 2:22:09.300\n They're like, communism bad, red.\n\n2:22:09.300 --> 2:22:11.600\n I was obsessed with the question and still am.\n\n2:22:11.600 --> 2:22:13.620\n I will never be,\n\n2:22:13.620 --> 2:22:18.520\n I will never quench my thirst for Russian history.\n\n2:22:18.520 --> 2:22:23.520\n I love that period of 1890 to 1925.\n\n2:22:26.820 --> 2:22:30.180\n It's just like, it's so fucking crazy.\n\n2:22:30.180 --> 2:22:35.020\n Like the autocracy embodied in Czar Alexander.\n\n2:22:35.020 --> 2:22:38.820\n And then you get this like weird fail son, Nicholas,\n\n2:22:38.820 --> 2:22:42.200\n who is kind of a good guy, but also terrible.\n\n2:22:42.200 --> 2:22:44.820\n And also Russian autocracy itself is terrible.\n\n2:22:44.820 --> 2:22:47.580\n And then I just became obsessed with the question of like,\n\n2:22:47.580 --> 2:22:49.560\n why did the Bolshevik revolution succeed?\n\n2:22:49.560 --> 2:22:51.300\n Because like people in Russia\n\n2:22:51.300 --> 2:22:53.900\n didn't necessarily want Bolshevism.\n\n2:22:53.900 --> 2:22:56.380\n People suffered a lot under Bolshevism\n\n2:22:56.380 --> 2:22:58.080\n and it led to Stalinism.\n\n2:22:58.080 --> 2:23:01.140\n How did Vladimir Lenin do it, right?\n\n2:23:01.140 --> 2:23:04.520\n Like, and I became obsessed with that question.\n\n2:23:04.520 --> 2:23:06.340\n And it's still, I find it so interesting,\n\n2:23:06.340 --> 2:23:10.620\n which is that series of accidents of history,\n\n2:23:10.620 --> 2:23:13.800\n incredible boldness by Lenin,\n\n2:23:13.800 --> 2:23:17.800\n incredible real politic, smart,\n\n2:23:17.800 --> 2:23:21.740\n unpopular decisions made by Trotsky and Stalin,\n\n2:23:21.740 --> 2:23:25.420\n and just like the arrogance of the Czars\n\n2:23:25.420 --> 2:23:30.420\n and of the Russian like autocracy.\n\n2:23:31.500 --> 2:23:32.340\n But at the same time,\n\n2:23:32.340 --> 2:23:35.180\n there's all these like cultural implications of this, right?\n\n2:23:35.180 --> 2:23:37.660\n In terms of like how it became hollowed out\n\n2:23:37.660 --> 2:23:40.100\n post Catherine the Great and all that.\n\n2:23:40.100 --> 2:23:41.340\n I was obsessed with autocracy\n\n2:23:41.340 --> 2:23:44.080\n because Russia wasn't actual autocracy.\n\n2:23:44.080 --> 2:23:46.220\n And like actually, and I'm like, it was there.\n\n2:23:46.220 --> 2:23:49.260\n Like they didn't even remove serfdom\n\n2:23:49.260 --> 2:23:51.740\n to like the civil war in America.\n\n2:23:51.740 --> 2:23:52.940\n Like that's crazy.\n\n2:23:52.940 --> 2:23:55.860\n Like, you know, and nobody really talks about it.\n\n2:23:55.860 --> 2:23:57.940\n And I just became, yeah, I was like,\n\n2:23:57.940 --> 2:24:01.100\n was Bolshevism a natural reaction\n\n2:24:01.100 --> 2:24:03.900\n to the excesses of Czarism?\n\n2:24:03.900 --> 2:24:07.300\n There is a convenient explanation where that is true.\n\n2:24:07.300 --> 2:24:09.960\n But there were also a series of decisions\n\n2:24:09.960 --> 2:24:11.660\n made by Lenin and Stalin\n\n2:24:11.660 --> 2:24:13.940\n to kill many of the people in the center left\n\n2:24:13.940 --> 2:24:15.380\n and marginalized them\n\n2:24:15.380 --> 2:24:18.540\n and also not to associate with the more\n\n2:24:18.540 --> 2:24:23.120\n quote unquote, like amenable communists\n\n2:24:23.120 --> 2:24:26.640\n in order to make sure that their pure strain of Bolshevism\n\n2:24:26.640 --> 2:24:28.060\n was the only thing.\n\n2:24:28.060 --> 2:24:29.960\n And the reason I like that is because it comes back\n\n2:24:29.960 --> 2:24:31.420\n to a point I made earlier.\n\n2:24:31.420 --> 2:24:32.740\n It's all about intentionality,\n\n2:24:32.740 --> 2:24:36.940\n which is that you actually can will something into existence\n\n2:24:36.940 --> 2:24:38.460\n even if people don't want it.\n\n2:24:38.460 --> 2:24:39.460\n That was the craziest thing.\n\n2:24:39.460 --> 2:24:41.360\n Like nobody wanted this,\n\n2:24:41.360 --> 2:24:45.160\n but it's still ruled for half a century, more actually.\n\n2:24:45.160 --> 2:24:47.640\n I mean, almost 75 years.\n\n2:24:47.640 --> 2:24:50.140\n To think that there could have been a history\n\n2:24:50.140 --> 2:24:55.140\n of the Soviet Union that was dramatically different\n\n2:24:56.100 --> 2:25:00.860\n than Leninism, Stalinism, that was completely different.\n\n2:25:00.860 --> 2:25:03.020\n Like almost would be the American story.\n\n2:25:03.020 --> 2:25:04.340\n Yeah, easily.\n\n2:25:04.340 --> 2:25:06.320\n I mean, there's a world where,\n\n2:25:06.320 --> 2:25:07.780\n and I don't have all the characters,\n\n2:25:07.780 --> 2:25:10.540\n there's like Kerensky and then there was like\n\n2:25:10.540 --> 2:25:12.900\n whoever Lenin's number two, Stalin's chief rival.\n\n2:25:12.900 --> 2:25:15.900\n And even, I mean, look, even a Soviet Union led by Trotsky,\n\n2:25:15.900 --> 2:25:17.340\n that's a whole other world, right?\n\n2:25:17.340 --> 2:25:19.420\n Like literally a whole other world.\n\n2:25:19.420 --> 2:25:21.620\n And yeah, it's just, I don't know.\n\n2:25:21.620 --> 2:25:22.500\n I find it so interesting.\n\n2:25:22.500 --> 2:25:24.540\n I will never not be fascinated by Russia.\n\n2:25:24.540 --> 2:25:25.660\n I always will.\n\n2:25:25.660 --> 2:25:26.900\n It's funny that I get to talk to you.\n\n2:25:26.900 --> 2:25:28.620\n Cause it's like, I read this book.\n\n2:25:28.620 --> 2:25:29.460\n I forget what it's called.\n\n2:25:29.460 --> 2:25:31.260\n It won, I think it won a Pulitzer prize.\n\n2:25:31.260 --> 2:25:34.580\n And it was like the story of,\n\n2:25:34.580 --> 2:25:37.420\n I tried to understand Russia post Crimea.\n\n2:25:37.420 --> 2:25:40.120\n Cause I came up amongst people\n\n2:25:40.120 --> 2:25:41.700\n who are much more like neoconservative\n\n2:25:41.700 --> 2:25:43.900\n and they're like, fuck Russia, Russia bad.\n\n2:25:43.900 --> 2:25:46.260\n And I was like, okay, like what do these people think?\n\n2:25:46.260 --> 2:25:48.300\n And we have this narrative\n\n2:25:48.300 --> 2:25:49.860\n of like the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\n2:25:49.860 --> 2:25:52.980\n And then I read this book from the perspective of Russians\n\n2:25:52.980 --> 2:25:54.220\n who lived through the fall.\n\n2:25:54.220 --> 2:25:56.100\n And they were like, this is, I was like, this is terrible.\n\n2:25:56.100 --> 2:25:59.540\n Like actually the introduction of capitalism was awful.\n\n2:25:59.540 --> 2:26:03.060\n And like the rise of all these crazy oligarchs.\n\n2:26:03.060 --> 2:26:08.060\n That's why Putin was, came to power to like restore,\n\n2:26:08.980 --> 2:26:11.820\n restore order to the oligarchy.\n\n2:26:11.820 --> 2:26:13.240\n And he still talks to this day.\n\n2:26:13.240 --> 2:26:15.540\n Do you guys, I mean, that's always the threat of like,\n\n2:26:15.540 --> 2:26:17.940\n do you want to return to the nineties?\n\n2:26:17.940 --> 2:26:20.380\n Do you want to return to Yeltsin?\n\n2:26:20.380 --> 2:26:21.660\n But the thing is in the West,\n\n2:26:21.660 --> 2:26:23.940\n we have this like our own propaganda of like,\n\n2:26:23.940 --> 2:26:25.020\n no, Yeltsin was great.\n\n2:26:25.020 --> 2:26:25.980\n That was the golden age.\n\n2:26:25.980 --> 2:26:27.660\n What could have been with Russia?\n\n2:26:27.660 --> 2:26:29.980\n And I was like, well, what do actual Russians think?\n\n2:26:29.980 --> 2:26:34.300\n And so that, yeah, I'll always be fascinated by it.\n\n2:26:34.300 --> 2:26:37.980\n And then just like to understand the idea\n\n2:26:37.980 --> 2:26:41.320\n of feeling encircled by NATO and all of that,\n\n2:26:41.320 --> 2:26:44.500\n you have to understand like Russian defense theory\n\n2:26:44.500 --> 2:26:46.460\n all the way of going back to the czars\n\n2:26:46.460 --> 2:26:48.980\n has always been defense in depth\n\n2:26:48.980 --> 2:26:51.780\n in terms of having Estonia, Lithuania,\n\n2:26:51.780 --> 2:26:54.560\n and more as like protection of the heartland.\n\n2:26:54.560 --> 2:26:55.600\n I'm not justifying in this.\n\n2:26:55.600 --> 2:26:57.940\n So NATO shills like, please don't come after me.\n\n2:26:57.940 --> 2:27:01.180\n But look, Estonians like NATO.\n\n2:27:01.180 --> 2:27:02.020\n They want to be in NATO.\n\n2:27:02.020 --> 2:27:03.080\n So I don't want to minimize that.\n\n2:27:03.080 --> 2:27:04.300\n I'm more just saying like,\n\n2:27:04.300 --> 2:27:08.900\n I understand him and Russia much better having done that.\n\n2:27:08.900 --> 2:27:11.580\n And we are very incapable in America.\n\n2:27:11.580 --> 2:27:13.260\n I think this is probably because my parents are immigrants\n\n2:27:13.260 --> 2:27:14.340\n and I've traveled a lot.\n\n2:27:14.340 --> 2:27:17.300\n Of like putting yourself in the mind of people\n\n2:27:17.300 --> 2:27:21.060\n who aren't Western and haven't lived a history,\n\n2:27:21.060 --> 2:27:23.340\n especially our lives of America's fucking awesome.\n\n2:27:23.340 --> 2:27:24.580\n We're the number one country in the world.\n\n2:27:24.580 --> 2:27:27.940\n Like we're literally better than you, like in many ways.\n\n2:27:27.940 --> 2:27:31.380\n And they can't empathize with people\n\n2:27:31.380 --> 2:27:33.720\n who have suffered so much.\n\n2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:36.020\n And I just, yeah, it's just so interesting to me.\n\n2:27:36.020 --> 2:27:38.760\n What about if we could talk for just a brief moment\n\n2:27:38.760 --> 2:27:43.760\n about the human of Putin and power, you are clearly\n\n2:27:45.460 --> 2:27:46.940\n fascinated by power.\n\n2:27:48.260 --> 2:27:51.580\n Do you think power changed Putin?\n\n2:27:51.580 --> 2:27:54.220\n Do you think power changes leaders?\n\n2:27:54.220 --> 2:27:57.460\n If you look at the great leaders in history,\n\n2:27:57.460 --> 2:28:02.180\n whether it's LBJ, FDR, do you think power really\n\n2:28:02.180 --> 2:28:03.020\n changes people?\n\n2:28:03.020 --> 2:28:06.100\n Like, is there a truth to that kind of old proverb?\n\n2:28:06.100 --> 2:28:08.380\n It reveals, I think that's what it is.\n\n2:28:08.380 --> 2:28:09.380\n It reveals.\n\n2:28:09.380 --> 2:28:13.200\n So Putin was a much more deft politician,\n\n2:28:13.200 --> 2:28:15.200\n much more amenable to the West.\n\n2:28:15.200 --> 2:28:18.140\n If you think back, you know, to 2001 and more,\n\n2:28:18.140 --> 2:28:19.980\n right when he came, cause he was still,\n\n2:28:19.980 --> 2:28:21.860\n cause at that time his biggest problem\n\n2:28:21.860 --> 2:28:24.160\n was intra Russian politics, right?\n\n2:28:24.160 --> 2:28:27.420\n Like it was all consolidating power within the oligarchy.\n\n2:28:27.420 --> 2:28:31.060\n Once he did that by around like 2007,\n\n2:28:31.060 --> 2:28:34.680\n there's that famous time when he spoke out against the West\n\n2:28:34.680 --> 2:28:36.140\n at the Munich security conference.\n\n2:28:36.140 --> 2:28:37.500\n I forget when it was.\n\n2:28:37.500 --> 2:28:40.460\n And that's when everybody in the audience was like, whoa.\n\n2:28:40.460 --> 2:28:42.820\n And he was talking about like NATO encirclement\n\n2:28:42.820 --> 2:28:45.660\n and like, we will not be beaten back by the West.\n\n2:28:45.660 --> 2:28:49.020\n Very shortly afterwards, like the Georgia invasion happens.\n\n2:28:49.020 --> 2:28:51.180\n And that was like a big wake up call of like,\n\n2:28:51.180 --> 2:28:53.300\n we will not be pushed around anymore.\n\n2:28:53.300 --> 2:28:55.980\n I mean, he said before publicly, like the worst thing\n\n2:28:55.980 --> 2:28:57.340\n that ever happened was the fall.\n\n2:28:57.340 --> 2:28:58.180\n Or what did he say?\n\n2:28:58.180 --> 2:29:00.620\n He was like, the fall of the Soviet Union was a tragedy,\n\n2:29:00.620 --> 2:29:01.460\n right?\n\n2:29:01.460 --> 2:29:02.740\n Of course, people in the West were like, what?\n\n2:29:02.740 --> 2:29:04.140\n I'm like, I get it, right?\n\n2:29:04.140 --> 2:29:05.460\n Like they were a superpower.\n\n2:29:05.460 --> 2:29:08.500\n And now their population is declining.\n\n2:29:08.500 --> 2:29:09.580\n Like it's like a Petro state.\n\n2:29:09.580 --> 2:29:10.420\n It sucks.\n\n2:29:10.420 --> 2:29:11.780\n Like, I understand.\n\n2:29:12.740 --> 2:29:15.600\n I understand like how somebody could feel about that.\n\n2:29:15.600 --> 2:29:17.500\n I think it revealed his character,\n\n2:29:18.760 --> 2:29:23.420\n which is that I think he thinks of himself probably\n\n2:29:23.420 --> 2:29:27.780\n as he always has since 2001 as like this benevolent,\n\n2:29:27.780 --> 2:29:29.060\n almost as a benevolent dictator.\n\n2:29:29.060 --> 2:29:31.300\n He's like, without me, the whole system would collapse.\n\n2:29:31.300 --> 2:29:35.280\n I'm the only guy keeping all these people in check.\n\n2:29:35.280 --> 2:29:38.380\n Most Russians probably do support Putin\n\n2:29:38.380 --> 2:29:41.420\n because they feel like they support some form\n\n2:29:41.420 --> 2:29:43.480\n of functional government.\n\n2:29:43.480 --> 2:29:46.400\n And they view it as like a check against that,\n\n2:29:46.400 --> 2:29:50.980\n which is a long, has a long history within Russia too.\n\n2:29:50.980 --> 2:29:53.160\n So I don't know if it changed him.\n\n2:29:53.160 --> 2:29:55.940\n I think it just revealed him because it's not like he,\n\n2:29:55.940 --> 2:29:56.780\n I mean, he has a bill.\n\n2:29:56.780 --> 2:29:59.180\n You know, Navalny has put that like billion dollar palace\n\n2:29:59.180 --> 2:30:00.680\n and all that.\n\n2:30:00.680 --> 2:30:01.540\n I don't know.\n\n2:30:01.540 --> 2:30:03.780\n Sometimes I feel like Putin does that for show.\n\n2:30:03.780 --> 2:30:05.780\n He doesn't seem like somebody who indulges\n\n2:30:05.780 --> 2:30:06.740\n in all that stuff.\n\n2:30:06.740 --> 2:30:07.980\n Or maybe we just don't see it.\n\n2:30:07.980 --> 2:30:08.820\n Like, I don't know.\n\n2:30:08.820 --> 2:30:11.220\n Well, I don't, it's very difficult for me to understand.\n\n2:30:11.220 --> 2:30:13.740\n I've been hanging out, thanks to Clubhouse.\n\n2:30:13.740 --> 2:30:18.660\n A lot of, I've gotten to learn a lot about the Navalny folks\n\n2:30:18.660 --> 2:30:20.380\n and it's been very educational.\n\n2:30:21.260 --> 2:30:25.420\n Made me ask a lot of important questions about what,\n\n2:30:25.420 --> 2:30:27.160\n you know, question a lot of my assumptions\n\n2:30:27.160 --> 2:30:29.220\n about what I do and don't know.\n\n2:30:29.220 --> 2:30:34.220\n But I'll just say that I do believe, you know,\n\n2:30:34.440 --> 2:30:36.120\n there's a lot of the Navalny folks say\n\n2:30:36.120 --> 2:30:40.660\n that Putin is incompetent and is a bad executive,\n\n2:30:40.660 --> 2:30:44.340\n like is bad at basically running government.\n\n2:30:44.340 --> 2:30:46.340\n But to me.\n\n2:30:46.340 --> 2:30:48.460\n Well, why do Russians not think that?\n\n2:30:48.460 --> 2:30:49.300\n Right?\n\n2:30:49.300 --> 2:30:50.140\n Well, they probably say propaganda.\n\n2:30:50.140 --> 2:30:51.060\n They would say it's the press.\n\n2:30:51.060 --> 2:30:52.620\n Yeah, they would say the control.\n\n2:30:52.620 --> 2:30:56.740\n There is a strong either control or pressure on the press,\n\n2:30:56.740 --> 2:30:59.180\n but I think there is a legitimate support and love\n\n2:30:59.180 --> 2:31:02.220\n of Putin in Russia that is not grounded\n\n2:31:02.220 --> 2:31:05.100\n in just misinformation and propaganda.\n\n2:31:05.100 --> 2:31:07.380\n There's legitimacy there.\n\n2:31:07.380 --> 2:31:09.880\n Mostly I tried to remain apolitical\n\n2:31:09.880 --> 2:31:12.860\n and actually genuinely remain apolitical.\n\n2:31:12.860 --> 2:31:15.760\n I am legitimately not interested\n\n2:31:15.760 --> 2:31:18.900\n in the politics of Russia of today.\n\n2:31:18.900 --> 2:31:20.740\n I feel I have some responsibility\n\n2:31:20.740 --> 2:31:23.580\n and I'll take that responsibility on as I need to.\n\n2:31:23.580 --> 2:31:26.580\n But my fascination as it is perhaps with you\n\n2:31:26.580 --> 2:31:30.620\n in part is in the historical figure of Putin.\n\n2:31:30.620 --> 2:31:32.400\n I know he's currently president,\n\n2:31:32.400 --> 2:31:34.820\n but I'm almost looking like as if I was a kid\n\n2:31:34.820 --> 2:31:37.020\n in 30 years from now reading about him,\n\n2:31:37.020 --> 2:31:39.120\n studying the human being,\n\n2:31:40.120 --> 2:31:43.520\n the games of power that are played\n\n2:31:43.520 --> 2:31:47.100\n that got him to gain power, to maintain power,\n\n2:31:47.100 --> 2:31:51.100\n what that says about his human nature,\n\n2:31:51.100 --> 2:31:54.860\n the nature of the bureaucracy that's around him,\n\n2:31:54.860 --> 2:31:58.340\n the nature of Russia, the people, all those kinds of things,\n\n2:31:58.340 --> 2:32:00.660\n as opposed to the politics and the manipulation\n\n2:32:00.660 --> 2:32:03.620\n and the corruption and the control of the media\n\n2:32:03.620 --> 2:32:05.780\n that results in misinformation.\n\n2:32:05.780 --> 2:32:07.600\n Those are the bickering of the day,\n\n2:32:07.600 --> 2:32:08.620\n just like we were saying,\n\n2:32:08.620 --> 2:32:10.180\n what will actually be remembered\n\n2:32:10.180 --> 2:32:11.540\n about this moment in history?\n\n2:32:11.540 --> 2:32:14.020\n Totally, he's a transformational figure in Russian history.\n\n2:32:14.020 --> 2:32:16.780\n Really, like the bridge between the fall of the Soviet Union\n\n2:32:16.780 --> 2:32:18.500\n and the chaos of Yeltsin,\n\n2:32:18.500 --> 2:32:21.020\n that will be how he's remembered.\n\n2:32:21.020 --> 2:32:22.660\n The only question is what comes next\n\n2:32:22.660 --> 2:32:24.700\n and what he wants to come next.\n\n2:32:24.700 --> 2:32:26.540\n I'm always, I'm like, he's getting up.\n\n2:32:26.540 --> 2:32:27.980\n How old are you, 60 something?\n\n2:32:27.980 --> 2:32:28.820\n Yeah, 60.\n\n2:32:28.820 --> 2:32:31.780\n So he would be, I think he would be 80.\n\n2:32:31.780 --> 2:32:34.860\n So with the change of the constitution,\n\n2:32:34.860 --> 2:32:39.860\n he cannot be president until 2034, I think it is.\n\n2:32:44.500 --> 2:32:46.700\n So he would be like 80 something\n\n2:32:46.700 --> 2:32:48.540\n and he would be in power for over 30 years,\n\n2:32:48.540 --> 2:32:50.000\n which is longer than Stalin.\n\n2:32:51.700 --> 2:32:54.420\n But he still seems to be.\n\n2:32:54.420 --> 2:32:56.060\n Seems fit.\n\n2:32:56.060 --> 2:32:57.900\n I think he's gonna be around for a long time.\n\n2:32:57.900 --> 2:32:59.660\n But this is a fascinating question that you ask,\n\n2:32:59.660 --> 2:33:01.880\n which is like, what does he want?\n\n2:33:01.880 --> 2:33:02.720\n I don't know.\n\n2:33:02.720 --> 2:33:03.560\n Yeah, that's the question.\n\n2:33:03.560 --> 2:33:06.020\n I don't, and this is where I think,\n\n2:33:06.020 --> 2:33:07.780\n given all of his behavior and more,\n\n2:33:07.780 --> 2:33:09.180\n I don't know if it's about money.\n\n2:33:09.180 --> 2:33:11.160\n I don't know if it's about enriching himself.\n\n2:33:11.160 --> 2:33:13.620\n Obviously he did, to the tune of billions and billions\n\n2:33:13.620 --> 2:33:15.100\n and billions of dollars.\n\n2:33:15.100 --> 2:33:17.420\n But I think he probably,\n\n2:33:17.420 --> 2:33:20.300\n he's as close to like an actual Russian nationalist,\n\n2:33:20.300 --> 2:33:23.980\n like at the top, who really does believe in Russia\n\n2:33:23.980 --> 2:33:26.020\n as its rightful superpower.\n\n2:33:26.020 --> 2:33:29.320\n Everything he does seems to stem from that opposition\n\n2:33:29.320 --> 2:33:31.220\n to NATO, intro to Syria,\n\n2:33:31.220 --> 2:33:35.740\n like wanting to play a large role in affairs,\n\n2:33:35.740 --> 2:33:40.300\n deeply distrustful and yet coveting of the European powers.\n\n2:33:40.300 --> 2:33:44.580\n Like, I could describe every czar in those same language.\n\n2:33:44.580 --> 2:33:47.160\n Like every czar falls into the exact same category.\n\n2:33:47.160 --> 2:33:49.300\n Yeah, and I mean, it makes me wonder,\n\n2:33:49.300 --> 2:33:52.740\n looking at some of the biggest leaders in human history,\n\n2:33:52.740 --> 2:33:55.400\n to ask the question of what was the motivation?\n\n2:33:55.400 --> 2:33:58.100\n What was the motivation for even just the revolutionaries\n\n2:33:58.100 --> 2:34:00.280\n like Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin?\n\n2:34:00.280 --> 2:34:02.040\n What was the motivation?\n\n2:34:02.040 --> 2:34:05.760\n Because it sure as hell seems like the motivation\n\n2:34:05.760 --> 2:34:10.660\n was at least in part driven by the idea,\n\n2:34:11.500 --> 2:34:15.580\n by ideas, not self interest of like power.\n\n2:34:15.580 --> 2:34:18.020\n For Lenin, it was, I think he was a true believer\n\n2:34:18.020 --> 2:34:19.820\n and an actual narcissist\n\n2:34:19.820 --> 2:34:21.580\n who thought he was the only one who could do it.\n\n2:34:21.580 --> 2:34:23.660\n Stalin, I do think just wanted power.\n\n2:34:23.660 --> 2:34:25.180\n And realized, well, I don't know.\n\n2:34:25.180 --> 2:34:27.820\n Look, he wrote very passionately when he was young.\n\n2:34:27.820 --> 2:34:30.260\n And he was, he really believed in communism.\n\n2:34:30.260 --> 2:34:31.300\n In the beginning he did.\n\n2:34:31.300 --> 2:34:34.460\n I'm always fascinated as I'm like,\n\n2:34:34.460 --> 2:34:36.940\n around 1920, what happened, right?\n\n2:34:36.940 --> 2:34:40.300\n Post revolution, you crushed the whites.\n\n2:34:40.300 --> 2:34:42.500\n Now it's all about consolidation.\n\n2:34:42.500 --> 2:34:44.780\n That's where the games really began.\n\n2:34:44.780 --> 2:34:47.580\n And I'm like, I don't think that was about communism.\n\n2:34:47.580 --> 2:34:48.420\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:48.420 --> 2:34:53.260\n Yeah, maybe it became a useful propaganda tool,\n\n2:34:53.260 --> 2:34:55.700\n but it still seemed like he believed in it.\n\n2:34:55.700 --> 2:34:58.260\n Whether it was, of course, this is the question.\n\n2:34:58.260 --> 2:35:01.480\n I mean, this is the problem with conspiracy theories for me.\n\n2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:04.880\n And this is legitimate criticism towards me\n\n2:35:04.880 --> 2:35:06.060\n about conspiracy theories,\n\n2:35:06.060 --> 2:35:09.820\n which is just because you're not like this\n\n2:35:09.820 --> 2:35:11.300\n doesn't mean others aren't like this.\n\n2:35:11.300 --> 2:35:14.340\n So like, I can't believe that somebody be\n\n2:35:14.340 --> 2:35:16.860\n like deeply two faced.\n\n2:35:16.860 --> 2:35:18.980\n Oh, I've met them, you're welcome to Washington.\n\n2:35:18.980 --> 2:35:20.420\n Yeah.\n\n2:35:20.420 --> 2:35:25.420\n But like, I think that I would be able to detect like, no.\n\n2:35:27.340 --> 2:35:30.820\n Well, this, my question is, well, so there's differences.\n\n2:35:30.820 --> 2:35:35.620\n There's two face, like there's different levels of two face.\n\n2:35:35.620 --> 2:35:39.340\n Like what I mean is to be killing people\n\n2:35:39.340 --> 2:35:43.300\n and it's like house of cards style, right?\n\n2:35:43.300 --> 2:35:48.300\n And still present a front like you're not killing people.\n\n2:35:49.040 --> 2:35:52.100\n I don't know if, I guess it's possible,\n\n2:35:52.100 --> 2:35:55.100\n but I just don't see that at scale.\n\n2:35:55.100 --> 2:35:56.620\n Like there's a lot of people like that.\n\n2:35:56.620 --> 2:35:58.980\n And I don't, I have trouble imagining\n\n2:36:01.100 --> 2:36:04.260\n some, that's such a compelling narrative\n\n2:36:04.260 --> 2:36:06.180\n that people like to say.\n\n2:36:06.180 --> 2:36:09.820\n Like people, that's the conspiratorial mindset.\n\n2:36:09.820 --> 2:36:11.700\n I think that skepticism was really powerful\n\n2:36:11.700 --> 2:36:14.020\n and important to have because it's true.\n\n2:36:14.020 --> 2:36:15.940\n A lot of powerful people abuse their power,\n\n2:36:15.940 --> 2:36:20.940\n but saying that about, I feel like people over assume that.\n\n2:36:21.940 --> 2:36:25.620\n It's like, I see that with use of steroids often in sports.\n\n2:36:25.620 --> 2:36:29.380\n People seem to make that claim about like everybody\n\n2:36:29.380 --> 2:36:32.400\n who's successful and I want to be very, I don't know.\n\n2:36:32.400 --> 2:36:34.020\n Something about me wants to be cautious\n\n2:36:34.020 --> 2:36:37.940\n because I want to give people a chance.\n\n2:36:37.940 --> 2:36:39.540\n Being purely cynical isn't helpful.\n\n2:36:39.540 --> 2:36:40.380\n People say this about me.\n\n2:36:40.380 --> 2:36:42.500\n He's only saying this to do this.\n\n2:36:42.500 --> 2:36:44.700\n But at the same time, being naively optimistic\n\n2:36:44.700 --> 2:36:47.860\n about everything is also a kind of pedophilic scheme.\n\n2:36:47.860 --> 2:36:49.180\n People are going to fuck you over.\n\n2:36:49.180 --> 2:36:52.000\n And more importantly, that doesn't bother me.\n\n2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:53.720\n More importantly, you're not going to be able to reason\n\n2:36:53.720 --> 2:36:56.300\n about how to create systems that are going to be robust\n\n2:36:56.300 --> 2:37:01.300\n to corruption, to malevolent parties.\n\n2:37:01.380 --> 2:37:05.680\n So in order to create, you have to have a healthy balance\n\n2:37:05.680 --> 2:37:08.900\n of both, I suppose, especially if you want to actually\n\n2:37:08.900 --> 2:37:13.180\n engineer things that work in this world that has evil in it.\n\n2:37:13.180 --> 2:37:15.700\n I can't believe there's a book of Hitler on the desk.\n\n2:37:17.340 --> 2:37:20.480\n We've mentioned a lot of books throughout this conversation.\n\n2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:24.680\n I wonder, and this makes me really curious to explore\n\n2:37:25.780 --> 2:37:28.860\n in a lot of depth the kind of books\n\n2:37:28.860 --> 2:37:30.320\n that you're interested in.\n\n2:37:30.320 --> 2:37:32.780\n I think you mentioned in your show\n\n2:37:32.780 --> 2:37:35.780\n that you provide recommendations.\n\n2:37:35.780 --> 2:37:37.220\n Yes, I do.\n\n2:37:37.220 --> 2:37:39.440\n In the form of spoken word,\n\n2:37:39.440 --> 2:37:42.220\n can you beyond what we've already recommended\n\n2:37:42.220 --> 2:37:47.220\n mention books, whether it is historical, nonfiction,\n\n2:37:47.860 --> 2:37:50.460\n or whether it's more like philosophical or even fiction\n\n2:37:50.460 --> 2:37:52.540\n that had a big impact on your life?\n\n2:37:52.540 --> 2:37:53.820\n Is there a few that you can mention?\n\n2:37:53.820 --> 2:37:54.660\n Sure.\n\n2:37:54.660 --> 2:37:55.740\n I already talked about the Johnson books,\n\n2:37:55.740 --> 2:37:56.820\n so I'll leave that alone.\n\n2:37:56.820 --> 2:37:59.540\n Robert A. Caro, he's still alive, thank God.\n\n2:37:59.540 --> 2:38:01.540\n He's finishing the last book.\n\n2:38:01.540 --> 2:38:03.000\n I hope he makes it.\n\n2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:05.380\n So those Johnson books.\n\n2:38:05.380 --> 2:38:07.780\n Second, can I ask you a question about those books?\n\n2:38:07.780 --> 2:38:08.620\n Yes.\n\n2:38:08.620 --> 2:38:11.000\n What the hell do you fit into so many pages?\n\n2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:11.840\n Everything, man.\n\n2:38:12.900 --> 2:38:13.740\n Let me tell you this.\n\n2:38:13.740 --> 2:38:14.860\n So I'll just give you an anecdote.\n\n2:38:14.860 --> 2:38:16.500\n This is why I love these books.\n\n2:38:16.500 --> 2:38:19.500\n The beginning, the first book is about Lyndon Johnson.\n\n2:38:19.500 --> 2:38:22.780\n His life, when he gets elected to Congress,\n\n2:38:22.780 --> 2:38:26.260\n the book begins with a history of Texas\n\n2:38:26.260 --> 2:38:27.700\n and its weather patterns,\n\n2:38:27.700 --> 2:38:32.700\n and then of his great, great grandfather moving to Texas.\n\n2:38:32.700 --> 2:38:35.980\n Then the story of that, about a hundred or so pages in,\n\n2:38:35.980 --> 2:38:37.300\n you get to Lyndon Johnson.\n\n2:38:38.260 --> 2:38:39.980\n That's how you do it.\n\n2:38:39.980 --> 2:38:40.820\n Which is you get.\n\n2:38:40.820 --> 2:38:42.900\n It's like a Tolstoy style retelling.\n\n2:38:42.900 --> 2:38:44.500\n This is the thing, it's not a biography,\n\n2:38:44.500 --> 2:38:45.860\n it's a story of the times.\n\n2:38:45.860 --> 2:38:47.460\n That's a great biography.\n\n2:38:47.460 --> 2:38:49.940\n So another one, this isn't part of my list,\n\n2:38:49.940 --> 2:38:50.780\n so don't do it,\n\n2:38:52.020 --> 2:38:54.820\n is Grant, Ron Chernow.\n\n2:38:54.820 --> 2:38:57.460\n Ron Chernow's Grant, it's a thousand pages.\n\n2:38:57.460 --> 2:38:59.060\n And the reason I tell everybody to read it\n\n2:38:59.060 --> 2:39:01.540\n is it's not just the story of Grant,\n\n2:39:01.540 --> 2:39:04.380\n it is the story of pre civil war America,\n\n2:39:04.380 --> 2:39:08.900\n the Mexican American war, the civil war and reconstruction,\n\n2:39:08.900 --> 2:39:10.860\n all told in the life of one person\n\n2:39:10.860 --> 2:39:12.540\n who was involved in all three.\n\n2:39:12.540 --> 2:39:13.380\n Most people don't know anything\n\n2:39:13.380 --> 2:39:14.460\n about the Mexican American war.\n\n2:39:14.460 --> 2:39:15.820\n It's fascinating.\n\n2:39:15.820 --> 2:39:18.140\n Most people don't know anything about reconstruction.\n\n2:39:18.140 --> 2:39:19.780\n Now more so because people are talking,\n\n2:39:19.780 --> 2:39:21.140\n it's a hot topic now.\n\n2:39:21.140 --> 2:39:22.820\n I've been reading about it for years.\n\n2:39:22.820 --> 2:39:26.260\n That is another thing people need to learn a lot more about.\n\n2:39:26.260 --> 2:39:28.740\n In terms of non history books,\n\n2:39:28.740 --> 2:39:31.780\n the book that probably had the most impact on me,\n\n2:39:31.780 --> 2:39:34.820\n which is also a historical nonfiction\n\n2:39:34.820 --> 2:39:39.820\n is I am obsessed with Antarctic exploration.\n\n2:39:40.580 --> 2:39:43.380\n And it all began with a book\n\n2:39:43.380 --> 2:39:45.900\n called Shackleton's Incredible Journey,\n\n2:39:45.900 --> 2:39:48.700\n which is the collection of diaries\n\n2:39:48.700 --> 2:39:51.140\n of everybody who was on Shackleton's journey.\n\n2:39:51.140 --> 2:39:52.860\n For those who don't know,\n\n2:39:52.860 --> 2:39:56.700\n Shackleton was the last explorer\n\n2:39:56.700 --> 2:39:59.740\n of the heroic age of Antarctic exploration.\n\n2:39:59.740 --> 2:40:03.020\n He led a ship called the Endurance,\n\n2:40:03.020 --> 2:40:08.020\n which froze in the ice off the coast of Antarctica in 1914.\n\n2:40:10.220 --> 2:40:13.740\n And they didn't have radios over the last exploration,\n\n2:40:13.740 --> 2:40:16.060\n the last one without the age of radio.\n\n2:40:16.060 --> 2:40:18.540\n And he happens to freeze in the ice.\n\n2:40:18.540 --> 2:40:23.140\n And then the ship collapses after a year frozen in the ice.\n\n2:40:23.140 --> 2:40:28.140\n And this man leads his entire crew from that ship\n\n2:40:28.580 --> 2:40:31.100\n onto the ice with a team of dogs,\n\n2:40:31.100 --> 2:40:34.420\n survives out on the ice for another year\n\n2:40:34.420 --> 2:40:36.300\n with three little lifeboats\n\n2:40:36.300 --> 2:40:38.780\n and is able to get all of his men,\n\n2:40:38.780 --> 2:40:41.940\n every single one of them alive to an island\n\n2:40:41.940 --> 2:40:44.860\n hundreds of miles away called Elephant Island.\n\n2:40:44.860 --> 2:40:46.300\n And when they got there,\n\n2:40:46.300 --> 2:40:50.420\n he had to leave everybody behind except for six people.\n\n2:40:50.420 --> 2:40:54.660\n And him and two other guys, I'm forgetting their names,\n\n2:40:54.660 --> 2:40:59.660\n navigated by the stars 800 miles through the Drake Passage\n\n2:41:00.020 --> 2:41:03.540\n with seas of hundreds of feet to Prince,\n\n2:41:03.540 --> 2:41:05.660\n I think it's called Prince George's Island.\n\n2:41:05.660 --> 2:41:08.540\n And then when they got to Prince George's Island,\n\n2:41:08.540 --> 2:41:10.340\n they landed on the wrong side\n\n2:41:10.340 --> 2:41:14.060\n and they had to hike from one side to the other\n\n2:41:14.060 --> 2:41:15.660\n to go and meet the whalers.\n\n2:41:15.660 --> 2:41:17.500\n And every single one of those things\n\n2:41:17.500 --> 2:41:18.900\n was supposed to be impossible.\n\n2:41:18.900 --> 2:41:21.780\n Nobody was ever supposed to hike that island.\n\n2:41:21.780 --> 2:41:24.220\n It wasn't done again until like the 1980s\n\n2:41:24.220 --> 2:41:25.820\n with professional equipment.\n\n2:41:25.820 --> 2:41:28.180\n He did it after two years of starvation.\n\n2:41:28.180 --> 2:41:30.700\n Nobody was ever supposed to make it\n\n2:41:30.700 --> 2:41:33.420\n from Elephant Island to Prince George.\n\n2:41:33.420 --> 2:41:36.400\n The guy, they had to hold him steady, his legs,\n\n2:41:36.400 --> 2:41:38.260\n so that he could chart the stars.\n\n2:41:38.260 --> 2:41:41.680\n And if they miss this island, they're into open sea.\n\n2:41:41.680 --> 2:41:42.740\n They're dead.\n\n2:41:42.740 --> 2:41:44.180\n And then before that,\n\n2:41:44.180 --> 2:41:46.300\n how do you survive for a year on the ice?\n\n2:41:46.300 --> 2:41:47.540\n On seals.\n\n2:41:47.540 --> 2:41:51.660\n And before that, he kept his crew from depression\n\n2:41:51.660 --> 2:41:53.660\n frozen one year in the ice.\n\n2:41:53.660 --> 2:41:55.500\n It's just an amazing story.\n\n2:41:55.500 --> 2:41:58.420\n And it made me obsessed with Antarctic exploration.\n\n2:41:58.420 --> 2:42:00.020\n So I've read like 15 books on it.\n\n2:42:00.020 --> 2:42:01.860\n What the hell is it about the human spirit?\n\n2:42:01.860 --> 2:42:02.700\n It's amazing.\n\n2:42:02.700 --> 2:42:03.740\n That's the thing about Antarctica\n\n2:42:03.740 --> 2:42:05.300\n is it brings it out of you.\n\n2:42:05.300 --> 2:42:06.980\n So for example, I read another one recently\n\n2:42:06.980 --> 2:42:08.900\n called Mawson's Will.\n\n2:42:08.900 --> 2:42:10.740\n Douglas Mawson, he was an Australian.\n\n2:42:10.740 --> 2:42:15.100\n He was on one of the first Robert Frost expeditions.\n\n2:42:15.100 --> 2:42:17.540\n He leads an expedition down to the South.\n\n2:42:17.540 --> 2:42:21.700\n Him and a partner, they're leading explorations,\n\n2:42:21.700 --> 2:42:23.300\n 1908, something like that.\n\n2:42:23.300 --> 2:42:27.460\n They're going around Antarctica with dog teams.\n\n2:42:27.460 --> 2:42:32.340\n And what happens is they keep going over these snow bridges\n\n2:42:32.340 --> 2:42:34.620\n where there's a crevice, but it's covered in snow.\n\n2:42:34.620 --> 2:42:38.420\n And so one of the lead driver,\n\n2:42:38.420 --> 2:42:40.940\n the dogs go over and they plummet.\n\n2:42:40.940 --> 2:42:43.260\n And that sled takes with it.\n\n2:42:43.260 --> 2:42:47.420\n So the guy survives, but that sled takes all their food,\n\n2:42:47.420 --> 2:42:52.420\n half the dogs, their stove, the camping tent,\n\n2:42:52.860 --> 2:42:56.180\n the tent specifically designed for the snow, everything.\n\n2:42:56.180 --> 2:42:59.820\n And they're hundreds of miles away from base camp.\n\n2:42:59.820 --> 2:43:02.700\n He and this guy have to make it back there\n\n2:43:02.700 --> 2:43:05.740\n in time before the ship comes to come get them\n\n2:43:05.740 --> 2:43:07.700\n on an agreed upon date.\n\n2:43:07.700 --> 2:43:08.780\n And he makes it.\n\n2:43:08.780 --> 2:43:11.140\n But the guy he was with, he dies.\n\n2:43:11.140 --> 2:43:12.620\n And it's a crazy story.\n\n2:43:12.620 --> 2:43:14.260\n First of all, they have to eat the dogs.\n\n2:43:14.260 --> 2:43:16.340\n A really creepy part of Antarctic exploration\n\n2:43:16.340 --> 2:43:19.140\n is everyone ends up eating dogs at different points.\n\n2:43:20.180 --> 2:43:22.900\n And part of the theory, which is so crazy,\n\n2:43:22.900 --> 2:43:25.940\n is that the guy he was with was dying\n\n2:43:25.940 --> 2:43:28.940\n because they were eating dog liver.\n\n2:43:28.940 --> 2:43:31.260\n And dog liver has a lot of vitamin E,\n\n2:43:31.260 --> 2:43:32.940\n which if you eat too much of it,\n\n2:43:32.940 --> 2:43:34.700\n can give you like a poisoning.\n\n2:43:34.700 --> 2:43:38.140\n And so Mawson, by trying to help his friend,\n\n2:43:38.140 --> 2:43:38.980\n was giving him more liver.\n\n2:43:38.980 --> 2:43:40.900\n Of all the things that kills you.\n\n2:43:40.900 --> 2:43:42.780\n I know, it's dog liver.\n\n2:43:42.780 --> 2:43:44.260\n And so his friend ends up dying,\n\n2:43:44.260 --> 2:43:46.300\n have a horrific heart attack, all of that.\n\n2:43:46.300 --> 2:43:49.660\n Mawson crawls back hundreds of miles away,\n\n2:43:49.660 --> 2:43:54.140\n makes it back to base camp hours after the ship leaves.\n\n2:43:54.140 --> 2:43:57.900\n And two guys or a couple of guys stayed behind for him.\n\n2:43:57.900 --> 2:44:01.020\n And he basically has to recuperate for like six months\n\n2:44:01.020 --> 2:44:02.580\n before he can even walk again.\n\n2:44:02.580 --> 2:44:04.140\n But it's like you were saying about the human spirit.\n\n2:44:04.140 --> 2:44:07.460\n It's like Antarctica brings that out of people.\n\n2:44:07.460 --> 2:44:10.460\n Or Amundsen, the guy who made it to the South Pole,\n\n2:44:10.460 --> 2:44:12.740\n Robert Amundsen, oh my God.\n\n2:44:12.740 --> 2:44:16.740\n Like this guy trained his whole life in the ice\n\n2:44:16.740 --> 2:44:20.060\n from Norway to make it to the South Pole.\n\n2:44:20.060 --> 2:44:22.620\n And he beat Robert Frost, the British guy\n\n2:44:22.620 --> 2:44:24.660\n with all this money and all these,\n\n2:44:24.660 --> 2:44:26.060\n I could go on this forever.\n\n2:44:26.060 --> 2:44:27.300\n I'm obsessed with it.\n\n2:44:27.300 --> 2:44:31.500\n Well, first of all, I'm gonna take this part of the podcast.\n\n2:44:31.500 --> 2:44:32.940\n I'm gonna set it to music.\n\n2:44:32.940 --> 2:44:33.780\n I'm gonna listen to it.\n\n2:44:33.780 --> 2:44:35.560\n Cause I've been whining and bitching\n\n2:44:35.560 --> 2:44:39.180\n about running 48 miles of Goggins this next weekend.\n\n2:44:39.180 --> 2:44:41.380\n And this is gonna be so easy.\n\n2:44:41.380 --> 2:44:43.620\n I'm just gonna listen to this over and over in my head.\n\n2:44:43.620 --> 2:44:44.460\n You're gonna be.\n\n2:44:44.460 --> 2:44:45.780\n Elon's obsessed with Shackleton.\n\n2:44:45.780 --> 2:44:46.620\n He talks about him all the time.\n\n2:44:46.620 --> 2:44:48.780\n He uses, I was gonna ask you about that.\n\n2:44:48.780 --> 2:44:53.380\n He uses an example of that as an example\n\n2:44:53.380 --> 2:44:57.100\n of what Mars colonization would be like.\n\n2:44:57.100 --> 2:44:58.500\n He's right.\n\n2:44:58.500 --> 2:45:02.200\n No, Antarctica is as close to you can simulate that.\n\n2:45:03.780 --> 2:45:05.540\n Antarctica is as close to what you could simulate\n\n2:45:05.540 --> 2:45:06.380\n what it would get.\n\n2:45:06.380 --> 2:45:09.260\n That Nat Geo series on Mars, I'm not sure\n\n2:45:09.260 --> 2:45:10.780\n if you watched it, it's incredible.\n\n2:45:10.780 --> 2:45:11.980\n Elon's actually in it.\n\n2:45:11.980 --> 2:45:15.820\n And it's like, they get there, everything goes wrong.\n\n2:45:15.820 --> 2:45:19.000\n Somebody dies, like it's horrible.\n\n2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:20.540\n They can't find any water.\n\n2:45:20.540 --> 2:45:21.760\n It's not working.\n\n2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:22.600\n So what is it?\n\n2:45:22.600 --> 2:45:23.940\n Is it like simulating the experience\n\n2:45:23.940 --> 2:45:25.220\n of what it'd be like to colonize?\n\n2:45:25.220 --> 2:45:28.940\n So it's like a docu series where the fictionalized part\n\n2:45:28.940 --> 2:45:32.100\n is the like astronauts on Mars,\n\n2:45:32.100 --> 2:45:34.580\n but then they're interviewing people like Elon Musk\n\n2:45:34.580 --> 2:45:37.340\n and others who were the ones who like paved the way\n\n2:45:37.340 --> 2:45:38.780\n to get to Mars.\n\n2:45:38.780 --> 2:45:40.380\n So it's a really interesting concept.\n\n2:45:40.380 --> 2:45:41.900\n I think it's on Netflix.\n\n2:45:41.900 --> 2:45:44.180\n And yeah, I agree with him 100%,\n\n2:45:44.180 --> 2:45:46.300\n which is that the first guys to make,\n\n2:45:46.300 --> 2:45:51.020\n like for example, Robert Frost, who went to Australia,\n\n2:45:51.020 --> 2:45:54.220\n sorry, to Antarctica, the British explorer\n\n2:45:54.220 --> 2:45:56.220\n who was beaten to the South Pole three weeks\n\n2:45:56.220 --> 2:45:59.260\n by Robert Amundsen, he died on the way back.\n\n2:45:59.260 --> 2:46:01.460\n And the reason why is because he wasn't well prepared.\n\n2:46:01.460 --> 2:46:02.580\n He was arrogant.\n\n2:46:02.580 --> 2:46:06.060\n He didn't have the proper amounts of supplies.\n\n2:46:06.060 --> 2:46:08.420\n His team had terrible morale.\n\n2:46:08.420 --> 2:46:09.900\n Antarctica is a brutal place.\n\n2:46:09.900 --> 2:46:12.220\n If you fuck up one time, you die.\n\n2:46:12.220 --> 2:46:14.740\n And it's like, and this is what you read a lot about,\n\n2:46:14.740 --> 2:46:17.180\n which is the reason why such heroic characters\n\n2:46:17.180 --> 2:46:20.780\n like Shackleton Shine is a lot of people died.\n\n2:46:20.780 --> 2:46:23.620\n Like there were some people who got frozen in the eye.\n\n2:46:23.620 --> 2:46:27.980\n I mean, man, this again also came to the North exploration.\n\n2:46:27.980 --> 2:46:29.700\n So I read a lot about like the exploration\n\n2:46:29.700 --> 2:46:32.660\n of the North Pole and same thing.\n\n2:46:32.660 --> 2:46:36.900\n These unextraordinary men take people out into the ice\n\n2:46:36.900 --> 2:46:40.660\n and get frozen out there for years and shit goes so bad.\n\n2:46:40.660 --> 2:46:42.540\n They end up eating each other.\n\n2:46:42.540 --> 2:46:43.700\n They all die.\n\n2:46:43.700 --> 2:46:45.740\n There's a famous, one I'm forgetting his name,\n\n2:46:45.740 --> 2:46:47.580\n the British Franklin expedition,\n\n2:46:47.580 --> 2:46:50.860\n where they went searching for them for like 20 years.\n\n2:46:50.860 --> 2:46:52.900\n And they eventually came across a group of Inuit\n\n2:46:52.900 --> 2:46:55.380\n who were like, oh yeah, we saw some weird white men here\n\n2:46:55.380 --> 2:46:56.860\n like 15 years ago.\n\n2:46:56.860 --> 2:46:59.020\n And they find their bones and there's like saw marks,\n\n2:46:59.020 --> 2:47:01.020\n which showed that they were eating each other.\n\n2:47:01.020 --> 2:47:01.860\n I mean.\n\n2:47:01.860 --> 2:47:03.660\n So history remembers the ones who didn't eat each other.\n\n2:47:03.660 --> 2:47:06.820\n Yeah, well, yeah, we remember the ones who made it,\n\n2:47:06.820 --> 2:47:08.100\n but there are.\n\n2:47:09.420 --> 2:47:11.140\n And that would be the story of Mars as well.\n\n2:47:11.140 --> 2:47:12.300\n That will be the story of Mars.\n\n2:47:12.300 --> 2:47:14.500\n But, and nevertheless, that's the interesting thing\n\n2:47:14.500 --> 2:47:16.180\n about Antarctica.\n\n2:47:16.180 --> 2:47:19.660\n Nevertheless, something about human nature\n\n2:47:19.660 --> 2:47:21.500\n drives us to explore it.\n\n2:47:21.500 --> 2:47:22.340\n Yes.\n\n2:47:22.340 --> 2:47:23.980\n And that seems to be like, you know,\n\n2:47:23.980 --> 2:47:26.180\n a lot of people have this kind of,\n\n2:47:26.180 --> 2:47:28.460\n to me, frustrating conversations like,\n\n2:47:28.460 --> 2:47:31.500\n well, Earth is great, man.\n\n2:47:31.500 --> 2:47:33.180\n Why do we need to colonize Mars?\n\n2:47:33.180 --> 2:47:34.660\n You just don't get it.\n\n2:47:34.660 --> 2:47:35.500\n I don't know.\n\n2:47:35.500 --> 2:47:36.340\n I mean, I don't know.\n\n2:47:36.340 --> 2:47:39.220\n It's the same people that say like, why are you running?\n\n2:47:39.220 --> 2:47:41.620\n Like, why are you running a marathon?\n\n2:47:41.620 --> 2:47:43.980\n What are you running from, man?\n\n2:47:43.980 --> 2:47:44.820\n I don't know.\n\n2:47:44.820 --> 2:47:48.460\n It's pushing the limits of the human mind\n\n2:47:48.460 --> 2:47:51.300\n of what's possible.\n\n2:47:51.300 --> 2:47:54.180\n It's George Mallory because it's there.\n\n2:47:54.180 --> 2:47:55.460\n Yeah. It's simple.\n\n2:47:55.460 --> 2:47:59.340\n And that's somehow actually the result of that,\n\n2:47:59.340 --> 2:48:01.900\n if you want to be pragmatic about it,\n\n2:48:01.900 --> 2:48:04.260\n there's something about pushing that limit\n\n2:48:04.260 --> 2:48:06.420\n that has side effects that you don't expect\n\n2:48:06.420 --> 2:48:08.780\n that will create a better world back home\n\n2:48:08.780 --> 2:48:11.020\n for the people, not necessarily on Earth,\n\n2:48:11.020 --> 2:48:13.300\n but like just in general,\n\n2:48:13.300 --> 2:48:16.060\n it raises the quality of life for everybody,\n\n2:48:16.060 --> 2:48:19.900\n even though the initial endeavor doesn't make any sense.\n\n2:48:19.900 --> 2:48:24.820\n The very fact of pushing the limits of what's possible\n\n2:48:24.820 --> 2:48:28.740\n then has side effects of benefiting everybody.\n\n2:48:28.740 --> 2:48:32.100\n And it's difficult to predict ahead of time\n\n2:48:32.100 --> 2:48:33.540\n what those benefits will be.\n\n2:48:33.540 --> 2:48:35.140\n Say with colonizing Mars,\n\n2:48:35.140 --> 2:48:37.820\n it's unclear what the benefits will be for Earth\n\n2:48:37.820 --> 2:48:39.860\n or in general with struggling.\n\n2:48:39.860 --> 2:48:41.220\n What did we get from the moon?\n\n2:48:41.220 --> 2:48:43.460\n What did we get from Apollo, right?\n\n2:48:43.460 --> 2:48:45.460\n Technically, and there were a lot of socialists\n\n2:48:45.460 --> 2:48:46.620\n at the time making this argument.\n\n2:48:46.620 --> 2:48:49.340\n They're like, all this money going, you know what?\n\n2:48:49.340 --> 2:48:52.780\n We went to the fucking moon in 1969.\n\n2:48:52.780 --> 2:48:53.900\n That was amazing.\n\n2:48:53.900 --> 2:48:57.980\n The greatest feat in human history, period.\n\n2:48:57.980 --> 2:48:59.300\n What did we learn from it?\n\n2:48:59.300 --> 2:49:04.060\n We learned about interstellar or interplanetary travel.\n\n2:49:04.060 --> 2:49:06.540\n We learned that we could do something\n\n2:49:06.540 --> 2:49:10.900\n off of a device less powerful than the computer in my pocket.\n\n2:49:10.900 --> 2:49:15.500\n Like the amount of potential locked within my pocket\n\n2:49:15.500 --> 2:49:17.420\n and your pocket, I mean, this is,\n\n2:49:17.420 --> 2:49:19.380\n if you were to define my policies in one way,\n\n2:49:19.380 --> 2:49:21.020\n it's greatness, like national,\n\n2:49:21.020 --> 2:49:23.580\n a quest for national greatness.\n\n2:49:23.580 --> 2:49:26.460\n There is no greatness without fulfilling\n\n2:49:26.460 --> 2:49:28.660\n the ultimate calling of the human spirit,\n\n2:49:28.660 --> 2:49:31.140\n which is more, it's not enough.\n\n2:49:31.140 --> 2:49:32.500\n And why should it be?\n\n2:49:32.500 --> 2:49:34.500\n It wasn't enough.\n\n2:49:34.500 --> 2:49:38.340\n Our ancestors could have been content to sit,\n\n2:49:38.340 --> 2:49:39.860\n well, actually many of them were,\n\n2:49:39.860 --> 2:49:41.660\n were content to sit and say,\n\n2:49:41.660 --> 2:49:43.420\n these berries will be here for a long time.\n\n2:49:43.420 --> 2:49:44.940\n And they got eaten and they died.\n\n2:49:44.940 --> 2:49:48.580\n And it's the ones who got out and went to the next place\n\n2:49:48.580 --> 2:49:51.740\n and the next place and went across the Siberian land bridge\n\n2:49:51.740 --> 2:49:53.740\n and went across more.\n\n2:49:53.740 --> 2:49:55.420\n And it just did extraordinary things.\n\n2:49:55.420 --> 2:49:58.180\n The craziest ones, we are their offspring\n\n2:49:58.180 --> 2:50:01.380\n and we fail them if we don't go into space.\n\n2:50:01.380 --> 2:50:02.660\n That's how I would put it.\n\n2:50:03.940 --> 2:50:05.140\n You should run for president.\n\n2:50:05.140 --> 2:50:07.500\n I'm just pro space, man.\n\n2:50:07.500 --> 2:50:08.540\n I love space.\n\n2:50:08.540 --> 2:50:10.780\n No, you're pro doing difficult things\n\n2:50:10.780 --> 2:50:14.780\n and pushing, exploring the world in all of its forms.\n\n2:50:14.780 --> 2:50:18.740\n I hope that kind of spirit permeates politics too.\n\n2:50:18.740 --> 2:50:20.380\n That same kind of a...\n\n2:50:20.380 --> 2:50:21.540\n Can, can.\n\n2:50:21.540 --> 2:50:24.740\n I, well, it can, and I hope so.\n\n2:50:24.740 --> 2:50:25.940\n I don't know if you want to stay on it,\n\n2:50:25.940 --> 2:50:28.140\n but I think that was book number one or two.\n\n2:50:28.140 --> 2:50:28.980\n Oh, shit.\n\n2:50:28.980 --> 2:50:29.820\n Yeah, okay.\n\n2:50:29.820 --> 2:50:30.660\n All right, all right.\n\n2:50:30.660 --> 2:50:31.500\n Is there something else?\n\n2:50:31.500 --> 2:50:32.340\n Well, this one is second,\n\n2:50:32.340 --> 2:50:34.260\n this actually is a corollary to that, which is sapiens.\n\n2:50:34.260 --> 2:50:37.620\n And I know that's a very normal, normie answer.\n\n2:50:37.620 --> 2:50:38.580\n One of the best selling book.\n\n2:50:38.580 --> 2:50:40.020\n I think there's a reason for that.\n\n2:50:40.020 --> 2:50:41.540\n Yuval Noah Harari.\n\n2:50:41.540 --> 2:50:42.380\n Oh, cool.\n\n2:50:42.380 --> 2:50:44.620\n Okay, look, yes, he didn't do any new research.\n\n2:50:44.620 --> 2:50:45.460\n I get that.\n\n2:50:45.460 --> 2:50:46.500\n All he did was aggregate.\n\n2:50:46.500 --> 2:50:49.020\n I'm sure he's very controversial in the scientific community,\n\n2:50:49.020 --> 2:50:49.860\n but guess what?\n\n2:50:49.860 --> 2:50:50.700\n He wrote a great book.\n\n2:50:50.700 --> 2:50:55.700\n It's a very easy to read general explanation\n\n2:50:56.020 --> 2:50:58.140\n of the rise of human history.\n\n2:50:58.140 --> 2:51:00.580\n And it helps challenge a lot of preconceptions.\n\n2:51:00.580 --> 2:51:01.580\n Are we special?\n\n2:51:01.580 --> 2:51:02.620\n Are we an accident?\n\n2:51:02.620 --> 2:51:04.220\n Are we more like a parasite?\n\n2:51:04.220 --> 2:51:05.180\n Are we not?\n\n2:51:05.180 --> 2:51:07.980\n What, is there a destiny to all of us?\n\n2:51:07.980 --> 2:51:08.820\n I don't know.\n\n2:51:08.820 --> 2:51:10.980\n You know, if anything, it's like what I just described,\n\n2:51:10.980 --> 2:51:12.020\n which is more.\n\n2:51:12.020 --> 2:51:14.140\n Move, move out.\n\n2:51:14.140 --> 2:51:15.540\n The evolution of money.\n\n2:51:15.540 --> 2:51:17.780\n Like, I know he gets a lot of hate,\n\n2:51:17.780 --> 2:51:21.220\n but I think that he writes it so clearly and well\n\n2:51:21.220 --> 2:51:23.580\n that for your average person to be able to read that,\n\n2:51:23.580 --> 2:51:26.180\n you will come away with a more clear understanding\n\n2:51:26.180 --> 2:51:28.860\n of the human race than before.\n\n2:51:28.860 --> 2:51:30.700\n And I think that that's why it's worth it.\n\n2:51:30.700 --> 2:51:32.140\n I agree with you 100%.\n\n2:51:32.140 --> 2:51:35.580\n I'm ashamed to, I usually don't bring up sapiens\n\n2:51:35.580 --> 2:51:36.540\n because it's like.\n\n2:51:36.540 --> 2:51:38.780\n Yeah, it's like, everybody's uncle has read it,\n\n2:51:38.780 --> 2:51:40.180\n but that's a good thing.\n\n2:51:40.180 --> 2:51:43.340\n It is one of the, I think it'll be remembered\n\n2:51:43.340 --> 2:51:46.460\n as one of the great books of this particular era.\n\n2:51:46.460 --> 2:51:48.500\n Yeah, because it's so clearly,\n\n2:51:48.500 --> 2:51:50.780\n it's like the selfish gene with Dawkins.\n\n2:51:50.780 --> 2:51:53.460\n I mean, it just aggregates so many ideas together\n\n2:51:53.460 --> 2:51:54.820\n and puts language to it\n\n2:51:54.820 --> 2:51:57.260\n that makes it very useful to talk about.\n\n2:51:57.260 --> 2:51:59.340\n So it is one of the great books.\n\n2:51:59.340 --> 2:52:00.860\n 100%.\n\n2:52:00.860 --> 2:52:04.300\n Another one is definitely Born to Run for the same reason\n\n2:52:04.300 --> 2:52:06.660\n by Christopher McDougall, which is that.\n\n2:52:06.660 --> 2:52:09.020\n I'm just gonna listen to this whole podcast next week.\n\n2:52:09.020 --> 2:52:09.860\n You have to.\n\n2:52:09.860 --> 2:52:11.820\n Well, you should because it,\n\n2:52:11.820 --> 2:52:15.860\n you are inheriting our most basic skill, which is running.\n\n2:52:15.860 --> 2:52:19.060\n And reimagining human history\n\n2:52:19.060 --> 2:52:22.180\n or reimagining like what we were\n\n2:52:22.180 --> 2:52:25.820\n as opposed to what we are is very useful\n\n2:52:25.820 --> 2:52:27.700\n because it helps you understand\n\n2:52:27.700 --> 2:52:31.020\n how to tap into primal aspects of your brain,\n\n2:52:31.020 --> 2:52:32.660\n which just drive you.\n\n2:52:32.660 --> 2:52:35.580\n And the reason I love McDougall's writing is because\n\n2:52:35.580 --> 2:52:37.100\n I love anybody who writes like this.\n\n2:52:37.100 --> 2:52:39.580\n Malcolm Gladwell, who else?\n\n2:52:39.580 --> 2:52:42.540\n Michael Lewis, people who find characters\n\n2:52:42.540 --> 2:52:43.660\n to tell a bigger story.\n\n2:52:43.660 --> 2:52:45.900\n Michael Lewis finds characters to tell us the story\n\n2:52:45.900 --> 2:52:47.180\n of the financial crisis.\n\n2:52:48.220 --> 2:52:50.660\n Malcolm Gladwell writes, finds characters to tell us\n\n2:52:50.660 --> 2:52:53.020\n the story of learning new skills and outliers\n\n2:52:53.020 --> 2:52:55.420\n and whatever his latest book is,\n\n2:52:55.420 --> 2:52:56.940\n I forget what it's called.\n\n2:52:56.940 --> 2:53:00.140\n But McDougall tells the vignettes\n\n2:53:00.140 --> 2:53:02.540\n and a tiny story of a single person\n\n2:53:02.540 --> 2:53:04.700\n in the history of running\n\n2:53:04.700 --> 2:53:07.740\n and like how it's baked into your DNA.\n\n2:53:07.740 --> 2:53:10.540\n And I think there was just something very useful\n\n2:53:10.540 --> 2:53:11.700\n to that for me for being like,\n\n2:53:11.700 --> 2:53:13.220\n I don't need to go to the gym\n\n2:53:13.220 --> 2:53:15.380\n or like, I'm not saying, you should still go to the gym.\n\n2:53:15.380 --> 2:53:16.220\n I'll be clear.\n\n2:53:16.220 --> 2:53:19.820\n I'm saying like, in order to fulfill like who you are,\n\n2:53:19.820 --> 2:53:23.660\n you can actually tap into something that's the most basic.\n\n2:53:23.660 --> 2:53:24.940\n I don't know if, I'm sure if you listened\n\n2:53:24.940 --> 2:53:27.100\n to the David Cho episode with Joe Rogan.\n\n2:53:28.300 --> 2:53:29.140\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:53:29.140 --> 2:53:30.340\n Oh, where he's the animal.\n\n2:53:30.340 --> 2:53:31.180\n Yeah, right.\n\n2:53:31.180 --> 2:53:32.020\n With the baboon.\n\n2:53:32.020 --> 2:53:32.860\n When he goes hunting.\n\n2:53:32.860 --> 2:53:33.900\n And there's something to that, man.\n\n2:53:33.900 --> 2:53:34.740\n There's something to that.\n\n2:53:34.740 --> 2:53:37.820\n Where it's just like, they are living the way\n\n2:53:37.820 --> 2:53:39.500\n that we were supposed to.\n\n2:53:39.500 --> 2:53:40.540\n We're not supposed, well,\n\n2:53:40.540 --> 2:53:42.180\n I don't wanna put a normative judgment on it.\n\n2:53:42.180 --> 2:53:45.180\n They're living the way that we used to.\n\n2:53:45.180 --> 2:53:46.020\n There's something very fun.\n\n2:53:46.020 --> 2:53:48.740\n It feels more honest somehow to our true nature.\n\n2:53:48.740 --> 2:53:50.380\n There's a guy I follow on Instagram.\n\n2:53:50.380 --> 2:53:53.740\n I've come from, Paul Saladino, Carnivore MD.\n\n2:53:53.740 --> 2:53:57.220\n He just went over there to the Hadza to live with them.\n\n2:53:57.220 --> 2:53:59.380\n And I was watching his stuff just like,\n\n2:53:59.380 --> 2:54:03.460\n I was like, man, there's something in you that wants to go.\n\n2:54:03.460 --> 2:54:05.100\n I'm like, I wanna do that.\n\n2:54:05.100 --> 2:54:07.500\n I wouldn't be very good at it, but like I want to.\n\n2:54:07.500 --> 2:54:10.940\n I'm so glad that somebody who thinks deeply about politics\n\n2:54:10.940 --> 2:54:12.900\n is so fascinated with exploration\n\n2:54:12.900 --> 2:54:17.740\n and with the very basic nature,\n\n2:54:17.740 --> 2:54:20.180\n like human nature, nature of our existence.\n\n2:54:20.180 --> 2:54:21.500\n I love that.\n\n2:54:21.500 --> 2:54:23.060\n There's something in you.\n\n2:54:23.060 --> 2:54:25.100\n And still you're stuck in DC.\n\n2:54:25.100 --> 2:54:26.660\n For now, for now.\n\n2:54:26.660 --> 2:54:31.660\n Speaking of which, you're from Texas.\n\n2:54:32.580 --> 2:54:35.900\n What do you make of the future of Texas politically,\n\n2:54:35.900 --> 2:54:39.580\n culturally, economically?\n\n2:54:39.580 --> 2:54:43.580\n I am in part moving, well, I'm moving to Austin.\n\n2:54:43.580 --> 2:54:44.420\n Congrats.\n\n2:54:44.420 --> 2:54:46.860\n But I'm also doing the Eric Weinstein advice,\n\n2:54:46.860 --> 2:54:49.380\n which is like, dude, you're not married.\n\n2:54:49.380 --> 2:54:51.060\n You don't have kids.\n\n2:54:51.060 --> 2:54:52.940\n There's no such thing as moving.\n\n2:54:52.940 --> 2:54:54.580\n What are you moving?\n\n2:54:54.580 --> 2:54:59.580\n You're like your three suits and some shirts and underwear.\n\n2:54:59.940 --> 2:55:02.700\n What exactly is the move entail?\n\n2:55:02.700 --> 2:55:03.660\n So I have nothing.\n\n2:55:03.660 --> 2:55:07.980\n So I'm basically, it's very just remain mobile,\n\n2:55:07.980 --> 2:55:12.620\n but there's a promise, there's a hope to Austin.\n\n2:55:12.620 --> 2:55:17.300\n Outside of just like friendships,\n\n2:55:17.300 --> 2:55:18.980\n I have no, it's a very different culture\n\n2:55:18.980 --> 2:55:20.220\n that Joe Rogan is creating.\n\n2:55:20.220 --> 2:55:24.220\n I'm mostly interested in what the next Silicon Valley\n\n2:55:24.220 --> 2:55:28.500\n will be, what the next hub of technological innovation.\n\n2:55:28.500 --> 2:55:32.060\n And there's a promise, maybe a dream\n\n2:55:32.060 --> 2:55:34.460\n for Austin being that next place.\n\n2:55:34.460 --> 2:55:35.420\n It's very possible.\n\n2:55:35.420 --> 2:55:40.420\n Doesn't have the baggage of some of the political things,\n\n2:55:40.620 --> 2:55:45.620\n maybe some of the sort of things that hold back\n\n2:55:46.100 --> 2:55:49.700\n the beauty of, that makes capitalism,\n\n2:55:49.700 --> 2:55:51.740\n that makes innovation so powerful,\n\n2:55:51.740 --> 2:55:55.540\n which is like meritocracy, which is excellence.\n\n2:55:55.540 --> 2:55:57.380\n Diversity is exceptionally important,\n\n2:55:57.380 --> 2:56:01.700\n but it should not be the only priority.\n\n2:56:01.700 --> 2:56:05.820\n It has to be something that coexists\n\n2:56:05.820 --> 2:56:10.260\n with a like insatiable drive towards excellence.\n\n2:56:10.260 --> 2:56:13.580\n And it seems like Texas is a nice place,\n\n2:56:13.580 --> 2:56:18.580\n like having a Austin, which is like a kind of this weird,\n\n2:56:19.060 --> 2:56:20.500\n I hope it stays weird, man.\n\n2:56:20.500 --> 2:56:21.660\n I love weird people.\n\n2:56:21.660 --> 2:56:24.380\n I don't know about that, but we can get into it.\n\n2:56:24.380 --> 2:56:29.380\n But there's this hope is it remains this weird place\n\n2:56:29.380 --> 2:56:34.380\n of brilliant innovation amidst a state\n\n2:56:35.060 --> 2:56:36.420\n that's like more conservative.\n\n2:56:36.420 --> 2:56:38.380\n So like there's a nice balance of everything.\n\n2:56:38.380 --> 2:56:40.380\n What are your thoughts about the future of Texas?\n\n2:56:40.380 --> 2:56:43.180\n I think it's so fascinating to me\n\n2:56:43.180 --> 2:56:46.880\n because I never thought I would want to move back,\n\n2:56:46.880 --> 2:56:50.500\n but now I'm beginning to be convinced.\n\n2:56:50.500 --> 2:56:53.700\n So I'm going to stick to this clip.\n\n2:56:53.700 --> 2:56:55.220\n I am, I'm being honest\n\n2:56:55.220 --> 2:56:56.700\n and many Texas will hate me for this.\n\n2:56:56.700 --> 2:57:00.580\n But Texas was not a place that was kind to me, quote unquote.\n\n2:57:00.580 --> 2:57:04.140\n And this is because of my own parent.\n\n2:57:04.140 --> 2:57:07.020\n Look, I was raised in College Station, Texas,\n\n2:57:07.020 --> 2:57:08.780\n which is a town of 50,000.\n\n2:57:08.780 --> 2:57:10.420\n It's a university town.\n\n2:57:10.420 --> 2:57:13.080\n It exists only for the university.\n\n2:57:13.080 --> 2:57:14.500\n So it was a very,\n\n2:57:14.500 --> 2:57:16.500\n I did not get the full Texas experience\n\n2:57:16.500 --> 2:57:19.260\n purely speaking from a College Station experience.\n\n2:57:19.260 --> 2:57:24.260\n But growing up first generation, or I forget what it is,\n\n2:57:25.300 --> 2:57:26.220\n I'm the first American.\n\n2:57:26.220 --> 2:57:27.900\n I was born and raised in College Station.\n\n2:57:27.900 --> 2:57:29.140\n My parents are from India.\n\n2:57:30.220 --> 2:57:34.860\n Being raised in a town where the dominant culture\n\n2:57:34.860 --> 2:57:38.900\n was predominantly like white evangelical Christian was hard.\n\n2:57:38.900 --> 2:57:40.540\n Like it was just difficult.\n\n2:57:40.540 --> 2:57:43.820\n And I think of it,\n\n2:57:43.820 --> 2:57:46.260\n in the beginning, I would say like ages,\n\n2:57:46.260 --> 2:57:48.260\n like zero to like eight,\n\n2:57:48.260 --> 2:57:50.540\n it was like cultural ignorance,\n\n2:57:50.540 --> 2:57:53.500\n as in like they just don't know how to interact with you.\n\n2:57:53.500 --> 2:57:55.660\n And there was a level of,\n\n2:57:55.660 --> 2:57:58.580\n always there was like the evangelical kind of antipathy\n\n2:57:58.580 --> 2:58:01.140\n towards like you being not Christian.\n\n2:58:01.140 --> 2:58:02.220\n You know, my parents are Hindu.\n\n2:58:02.220 --> 2:58:03.860\n Like that's how I was raised.\n\n2:58:03.860 --> 2:58:05.920\n And so like, there was that.\n\n2:58:05.920 --> 2:58:08.220\n But 9 11 was very difficult.\n\n2:58:08.220 --> 2:58:13.040\n Like 9 11 happened when I was in third or fourth grade.\n\n2:58:13.040 --> 2:58:15.020\n And that changed everything, man.\n\n2:58:15.020 --> 2:58:18.440\n Like, I mean, our temple had to like print out T shirts.\n\n2:58:18.440 --> 2:58:20.460\n And I'm not saying this is a sob story, to be clear.\n\n2:58:20.460 --> 2:58:23.000\n I've still actually largely for my adult life\n\n2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:24.220\n identified on the political right.\n\n2:58:24.220 --> 2:58:27.140\n So don't take this as some like, you know, race manifesto.\n\n2:58:27.140 --> 2:58:29.220\n I'm just telling it like, this is what happened,\n\n2:58:29.220 --> 2:58:32.540\n which is that like we had,\n\n2:58:32.540 --> 2:58:35.340\n it was just hard to be proud, frankly,\n\n2:58:35.340 --> 2:58:40.340\n and to have some of the fallout from 9 11 and during Iraq.\n\n2:58:40.580 --> 2:58:45.580\n And the reason I am political is because I realize in myself,\n\n2:58:46.300 --> 2:58:49.660\n I have a strong rebellious nature\n\n2:58:49.660 --> 2:58:52.980\n against systems and structures of power.\n\n2:58:52.980 --> 2:58:55.700\n And the first people I ever rebelled against\n\n2:58:55.700 --> 2:58:58.860\n were all the people telling me to shut up\n\n2:58:58.860 --> 2:59:00.660\n and not question the Iraq war.\n\n2:59:00.660 --> 2:59:02.660\n So the reason I am in politics\n\n2:59:02.660 --> 2:59:07.340\n is because I hated George W. Bush with a passion\n\n2:59:07.340 --> 2:59:08.860\n and I hated the war.\n\n2:59:08.860 --> 2:59:10.960\n And I was so, again, my entire background\n\n2:59:10.960 --> 2:59:12.740\n is largely in national security for this reason,\n\n2:59:12.740 --> 2:59:15.660\n which is I was obsessed with the idea of like,\n\n2:59:15.660 --> 2:59:18.340\n how do we get people who are not gonna get us\n\n2:59:18.340 --> 2:59:21.380\n into these quagmire situations in positions of power?\n\n2:59:21.380 --> 2:59:24.220\n That's how I became fascinated by power in the first place\n\n2:59:24.220 --> 2:59:27.800\n was all a question of how do this happen?\n\n2:59:27.800 --> 2:59:30.460\n Like, how did this catastrophe happen?\n\n2:59:30.460 --> 2:59:32.300\n I realized it's not as bad as like, you know,\n\n2:59:32.300 --> 2:59:34.500\n previous conflicts, but this one was mine.\n\n2:59:34.500 --> 2:59:38.100\n And to see how it changed our domestic politics forever.\n\n2:59:38.100 --> 2:59:40.760\n And so that was my rebellion.\n\n2:59:40.760 --> 2:59:41.600\n But it's funny,\n\n2:59:41.600 --> 2:59:44.580\n because I identified on the left when I was growing up,\n\n2:59:44.580 --> 2:59:48.700\n up until I was 18, I had also a funny two year stint.\n\n2:59:48.700 --> 2:59:50.260\n This is where everything kind of changed for me\n\n2:59:50.260 --> 2:59:51.620\n when I was 16, actually.\n\n2:59:51.620 --> 2:59:53.780\n I moved to Qatar, to Doha, Qatar,\n\n2:59:53.780 --> 2:59:57.380\n because my dad was a dean or associate dean\n\n2:59:57.380 --> 3:00:00.160\n of Texas A&M University at Doha.\n\n3:00:00.160 --> 3:00:02.160\n So my last two years of high school were at this.\n\n3:00:02.160 --> 3:00:04.160\n I went from this small town in Texas,\n\n3:00:04.160 --> 3:00:07.440\n and I love my parents because they could recognize\n\n3:00:07.440 --> 3:00:10.140\n that I had within me that I was not a small town kid.\n\n3:00:10.140 --> 3:00:13.320\n So they took me out of this country every chance they got.\n\n3:00:13.320 --> 3:00:16.420\n I traveled everywhere and constantly let me go.\n\n3:00:16.420 --> 3:00:20.100\n And so I went from school in College Station\n\n3:00:20.100 --> 3:00:24.380\n to like this ritzy private school, American school.\n\n3:00:24.380 --> 3:00:26.140\n Best thing that ever happened to me,\n\n3:00:26.140 --> 3:00:29.520\n because first of all, it got me out of College Station.\n\n3:00:29.520 --> 3:00:34.260\n Second, at that time, I had this annoying streak of,\n\n3:00:34.260 --> 3:00:36.400\n I wouldn't call it being anti America,\n\n3:00:36.400 --> 3:00:38.640\n but you don't appreciate America.\n\n3:00:38.640 --> 3:00:40.380\n Let me tell everybody out there listening,\n\n3:00:40.380 --> 3:00:44.940\n leave for a while, you will miss it so much.\n\n3:00:44.940 --> 3:00:47.740\n You do not know what it is like\n\n3:00:47.740 --> 3:00:50.900\n to not have freedom of speech until you don't have it.\n\n3:00:50.900 --> 3:00:55.140\n And I was going to high school\n\n3:00:55.140 --> 3:00:57.940\n with these guys in the Qatari royal family.\n\n3:00:57.940 --> 3:00:59.940\n And all I wanted to do was speak out\n\n3:00:59.940 --> 3:01:01.380\n of how they were pieces of shit\n\n3:01:01.380 --> 3:01:03.740\n for the way that they treated Indian citizens\n\n3:01:03.740 --> 3:01:06.940\n in that country who are basically used as slave labor.\n\n3:01:06.940 --> 3:01:08.780\n And I could not say one word\n\n3:01:08.780 --> 3:01:10.500\n because I knew I would be deported\n\n3:01:10.500 --> 3:01:12.460\n and I knew my dad would lose his job\n\n3:01:12.460 --> 3:01:13.940\n and my mom would lose her job\n\n3:01:13.940 --> 3:01:15.920\n and we would be forced out of the country.\n\n3:01:15.920 --> 3:01:17.660\n You don't know what it's like to live like that.\n\n3:01:17.660 --> 3:01:20.240\n Or to be in a society where like,\n\n3:01:20.240 --> 3:01:22.420\n you have like a high school girlfriend or something\n\n3:01:22.420 --> 3:01:25.080\n and you can't even touch in public\n\n3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:27.600\n or you're lectured for public decency.\n\n3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:31.120\n Like, listen, I've lived under a Gulf monarchy now.\n\n3:01:31.120 --> 3:01:36.120\n And that turned me into the most pro America guy ever.\n\n3:01:36.220 --> 3:01:40.140\n Like I came back so like Merica,\n\n3:01:40.140 --> 3:01:43.740\n like I still am because of that experience.\n\n3:01:43.740 --> 3:01:46.220\n Living abroad, like that will do it to you.\n\n3:01:46.220 --> 3:01:48.380\n Live in a non democracy.\n\n3:01:48.380 --> 3:01:51.580\n You have, even in Europe, I would say,\n\n3:01:51.580 --> 3:01:53.260\n you guys aren't living as free as we are here.\n\n3:01:53.260 --> 3:01:55.140\n It's awesome and I love it.\n\n3:01:55.140 --> 3:01:56.680\n You're ultimately another human being\n\n3:01:56.680 --> 3:01:58.420\n than the one who left Texas.\n\n3:01:58.420 --> 3:01:59.260\n Yeah.\n\n3:01:59.260 --> 3:02:03.060\n So, I mean, have you actually considered moving to Texas\n\n3:02:03.060 --> 3:02:05.720\n and broadly just outside of your own story,\n\n3:02:05.720 --> 3:02:07.460\n what do you think is the future of Texas?\n\n3:02:07.460 --> 3:02:08.980\n What is the future of Austin?\n\n3:02:08.980 --> 3:02:12.940\n There's so much transformation seemingly happening now\n\n3:02:12.940 --> 3:02:15.460\n related to Silicon Valley, to California.\n\n3:02:15.460 --> 3:02:16.300\n That's what's been so hard to me,\n\n3:02:16.300 --> 3:02:18.980\n which is that since I left, it's changed dramatically,\n\n3:02:18.980 --> 3:02:22.860\n which is that it used to be like this conservative state\n\n3:02:22.860 --> 3:02:25.700\n where the main money to be made was oil.\n\n3:02:25.700 --> 3:02:26.660\n And everybody knew that.\n\n3:02:26.660 --> 3:02:30.420\n Petro, it was a Petro state, Houston, all of that.\n\n3:02:30.420 --> 3:02:33.200\n Austin was always weird, but it was more of a music town\n\n3:02:33.200 --> 3:02:34.240\n and a university town.\n\n3:02:34.240 --> 3:02:35.740\n It was not a tech town.\n\n3:02:35.740 --> 3:02:39.180\n But in the 10 years or so since I left,\n\n3:02:39.180 --> 3:02:40.900\n I have begun to realize, I'm like,\n\n3:02:40.900 --> 3:02:43.180\n well, the Texas I grew up in is over.\n\n3:02:43.180 --> 3:02:48.180\n It is not a deep red state in any sense of the term.\n\n3:02:48.220 --> 3:02:51.780\n The number one Uhaul route in the country pre pandemic\n\n3:02:51.780 --> 3:02:54.480\n already was San Francisco to Austin, okay?\n\n3:02:54.480 --> 3:02:57.520\n So like you have this massive influx of people\n\n3:02:57.520 --> 3:03:00.100\n from California and New York.\n\n3:03:00.100 --> 3:03:03.020\n And the state, the composition of it\n\n3:03:03.020 --> 3:03:04.780\n is changed dramatically.\n\n3:03:04.780 --> 3:03:08.020\n The intra composition and the ultra, yeah.\n\n3:03:08.020 --> 3:03:10.500\n So the intra composition, it's become way more urban.\n\n3:03:10.500 --> 3:03:13.540\n It's from when I grew up, Texas was a much more rural state.\n\n3:03:13.540 --> 3:03:15.460\n Its politics were much more static.\n\n3:03:15.460 --> 3:03:17.580\n It looked much more like Rick Perry,\n\n3:03:17.580 --> 3:03:22.580\n like he was a very accurate representation of who we were.\n\n3:03:22.620 --> 3:03:25.420\n Now, I don't think that that's the case.\n\n3:03:25.420 --> 3:03:28.180\n Texas is now a dynamic economy,\n\n3:03:28.180 --> 3:03:32.720\n not just 100% reliant on oil because of its kind of like,\n\n3:03:33.580 --> 3:03:35.780\n I would call it like regulatory arbitrage\n\n3:03:35.780 --> 3:03:38.060\n relative to California and New York\n\n3:03:38.060 --> 3:03:41.540\n offers a large incentive to people who are more,\n\n3:03:41.540 --> 3:03:43.060\n I wouldn't say culturally liberal,\n\n3:03:43.060 --> 3:03:45.400\n but they're not necessarily like culturally conservative,\n\n3:03:45.400 --> 3:03:47.140\n like the people who I grew up with.\n\n3:03:47.140 --> 3:03:49.180\n That's changed the whole state's politics.\n\n3:03:49.180 --> 3:03:51.940\n Beto came two points away from beating Ted Cruz.\n\n3:03:51.940 --> 3:03:53.500\n I'm not saying the state's gonna go blue.\n\n3:03:53.500 --> 3:03:55.540\n I think the Republican party will just change\n\n3:03:55.540 --> 3:03:57.100\n and we'll have to readjust.\n\n3:03:57.100 --> 3:04:01.940\n But the re urbanization of Texas has made it,\n\n3:04:01.940 --> 3:04:03.220\n I'll put it in this way,\n\n3:04:03.220 --> 3:04:08.220\n much more attractive to me than the place that I grew up.\n\n3:04:09.380 --> 3:04:11.320\n And then from my perspective,\n\n3:04:11.320 --> 3:04:12.160\n well, first of all,\n\n3:04:12.160 --> 3:04:16.660\n I love some of the cowboy things that Texas stands for,\n\n3:04:16.660 --> 3:04:18.740\n but for more practically, from my perspective,\n\n3:04:18.740 --> 3:04:23.160\n the injection of the tech innovation\n\n3:04:23.160 --> 3:04:27.860\n that's moving to Texas has made it very exciting to me.\n\n3:04:27.860 --> 3:04:29.780\n It seems like outside of all that,\n\n3:04:29.780 --> 3:04:32.060\n maybe you can speak to the weird in Austin.\n\n3:04:32.060 --> 3:04:37.060\n It seems like I know that Joe Rogan is a rich,\n\n3:04:39.380 --> 3:04:42.980\n sort of almost like mainstream at this point,\n\n3:04:42.980 --> 3:04:45.260\n but he's also attracting a lot of weirdos.\n\n3:04:45.260 --> 3:04:48.740\n And so is Elon and a lot of those weirdos are my friends\n\n3:04:48.740 --> 3:04:52.560\n and they're like Michael Malice, like those weirdos.\n\n3:04:53.540 --> 3:04:55.840\n And it's like, I have a hope for Austin\n\n3:04:55.840 --> 3:04:57.900\n that all kinds of different flavors of weirdos\n\n3:04:57.900 --> 3:04:59.020\n will get injected.\n\n3:04:59.020 --> 3:05:00.140\n It's possible.\n\n3:05:00.140 --> 3:05:02.860\n I actually think the most significant thing that happened\n\n3:05:02.860 --> 3:05:06.180\n were Tesla moving there.\n\n3:05:06.180 --> 3:05:08.360\n The reason why is I love Joe, obviously,\n\n3:05:08.360 --> 3:05:11.260\n but he can only attract X amount of people.\n\n3:05:11.260 --> 3:05:14.460\n Elon actually employs thousands of people.\n\n3:05:14.460 --> 3:05:16.980\n And then you will also Oracle.\n\n3:05:16.980 --> 3:05:20.840\n Oracle's decision to move to Austin is just as important\n\n3:05:20.840 --> 3:05:25.440\n because those two men, Larry, was it Ellison, right?\n\n3:05:25.440 --> 3:05:27.260\n Ellison and Elon,\n\n3:05:27.260 --> 3:05:30.380\n they actually employ tens of thousands of people\n\n3:05:30.380 --> 3:05:33.740\n collectively, that can change the nature of the city.\n\n3:05:33.740 --> 3:05:36.620\n So you combine that with Joe bringing\n\n3:05:36.620 --> 3:05:39.060\n this entire new entertainment complex\n\n3:05:39.060 --> 3:05:42.740\n with the bodies of people who will appreciate\n\n3:05:42.740 --> 3:05:44.540\n said entertainment complex.\n\n3:05:44.540 --> 3:05:46.220\n Spend money on the entertainment.\n\n3:05:46.220 --> 3:05:48.780\n Exactly, you just remade the entire city.\n\n3:05:48.780 --> 3:05:50.820\n And that's why I'm fascinated.\n\n3:05:50.820 --> 3:05:52.260\n And obviously there's network effects,\n\n3:05:52.260 --> 3:05:54.660\n which is now that all those people are down there,\n\n3:05:54.660 --> 3:05:55.940\n I mean, if I were Elon Musk,\n\n3:05:55.940 --> 3:05:57.460\n I would donate a shit ton of money\n\n3:05:57.460 --> 3:05:58.580\n to the University of Texas\n\n3:05:58.580 --> 3:06:01.340\n and I would turn it into my Stanford for Silicon Valley.\n\n3:06:01.340 --> 3:06:03.180\n Let's introduce some competition\n\n3:06:03.180 --> 3:06:07.100\n and let UT Austin hire the best software developers,\n\n3:06:07.100 --> 3:06:08.820\n engineers, professors, and more,\n\n3:06:08.820 --> 3:06:12.900\n and turn Texas into a true like Austin revolving door hub\n\n3:06:12.900 --> 3:06:16.500\n where people come to UT Austin to get an internship at Tesla\n\n3:06:16.500 --> 3:06:18.420\n and then become an executive there\n\n3:06:18.420 --> 3:06:19.980\n and then create their own company\n\n3:06:19.980 --> 3:06:22.660\n in their own garage in Austin,\n\n3:06:22.660 --> 3:06:24.560\n which is the next Facebook, Twitter.\n\n3:06:24.560 --> 3:06:25.700\n That's how it happens.\n\n3:06:25.700 --> 3:06:27.620\n This is why I'm much more skeptical of Miami.\n\n3:06:27.620 --> 3:06:29.380\n There's a whole like tech Miami crew.\n\n3:06:29.380 --> 3:06:32.220\n I'm like, yeah, like there's no university.\n\n3:06:32.220 --> 3:06:34.060\n It's very inorganic.\n\n3:06:34.060 --> 3:06:35.420\n Look, I think Miami is awesome.\n\n3:06:35.420 --> 3:06:38.220\n I just like, I don't know if the same building blocks\n\n3:06:38.220 --> 3:06:42.060\n are there and also no multi billion dollar companies\n\n3:06:42.060 --> 3:06:44.840\n which employ thousands of people are coming there.\n\n3:06:44.840 --> 3:06:45.880\n That's the ingredient.\n\n3:06:45.880 --> 3:06:47.340\n It's not just Joe Rogan.\n\n3:06:47.340 --> 3:06:48.940\n It's not just even Elon Musk\n\n3:06:48.940 --> 3:06:50.660\n if he's still operated in California.\n\n3:06:50.660 --> 3:06:52.700\n It's all the people he employs.\n\n3:06:52.700 --> 3:06:56.460\n I think that is where, I think Texas is going\n\n3:06:56.460 --> 3:06:59.380\n to dramatically change within the next 10 years.\n\n3:06:59.380 --> 3:07:03.260\n Alternative to, it's already become a more urbanized state\n\n3:07:03.260 --> 3:07:05.760\n that's moved away from oil and gas\n\n3:07:05.760 --> 3:07:07.440\n in terms of like its emphasis,\n\n3:07:07.440 --> 3:07:09.860\n not necessarily in terms of his real economics.\n\n3:07:09.860 --> 3:07:11.120\n And 10 years from now,\n\n3:07:11.120 --> 3:07:14.300\n I don't think it will be necessarily the name prop\n\n3:07:14.300 --> 3:07:16.380\n like of the town.\n\n3:07:16.380 --> 3:07:19.340\n The only question to me is how that manifests politically\n\n3:07:19.340 --> 3:07:22.060\n because it's very possible though,\n\n3:07:22.060 --> 3:07:24.160\n because a lot of these workers themselves\n\n3:07:24.160 --> 3:07:27.300\n are California culturally liberal.\n\n3:07:27.300 --> 3:07:29.640\n You could see a Gavin Newsom type person\n\n3:07:29.640 --> 3:07:31.900\n getting elected governor of Texas\n\n3:07:31.900 --> 3:07:34.360\n or like the mayor of Austin.\n\n3:07:34.360 --> 3:07:36.340\n I mean, look, mayor of Austin is already a Democrat, right?\n\n3:07:36.340 --> 3:07:39.460\n Like, I mean, Joe has his own problems with Austin.\n\n3:07:39.460 --> 3:07:41.540\n It's funny, I remember him leaving LA\n\n3:07:41.540 --> 3:07:43.700\n and I'm like, I don't know, have you been to Austin?\n\n3:07:43.700 --> 3:07:48.460\n Like, it's not everything it's cracked up to be,\n\n3:07:48.460 --> 3:07:49.300\n necessarily.\n\n3:07:49.300 --> 3:07:52.980\n But no matter what, a new place allows the possibility\n\n3:07:52.980 --> 3:07:57.180\n for new ideas, even if they're somehow left leaning\n\n3:07:57.180 --> 3:07:58.180\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n3:07:58.180 --> 3:08:00.320\n I do think the only two things missing\n\n3:08:00.320 --> 3:08:04.620\n from Austin and Texas are two dudes in a suit\n\n3:08:05.580 --> 3:08:07.140\n that sometimes have a podcast\n\n3:08:07.140 --> 3:08:08.720\n talking a bunch of nonsense on a mic.\n\n3:08:08.720 --> 3:08:11.700\n So let's bring the best suit game to Texas.\n\n3:08:11.700 --> 3:08:15.120\n I hope you do make it to Texas at some point.\n\n3:08:15.120 --> 3:08:17.220\n Thanks so much for talking to me.\n\n3:08:17.220 --> 3:08:18.780\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n3:08:18.780 --> 3:08:20.020\n with Sagar and Jetty.\n\n3:08:20.020 --> 3:08:22.020\n And thank you to our sponsors,\n\n3:08:22.020 --> 3:08:25.620\n Jordan Harmer's show, Grammarly grammar assistant,\n\n3:08:25.620 --> 3:08:27.440\n eight sleep self cooling bed\n\n3:08:27.440 --> 3:08:30.420\n and magic spoon low carb cereal.\n\n3:08:30.420 --> 3:08:32.420\n Click the sponsor links to get a discount\n\n3:08:32.420 --> 3:08:34.900\n and to support this podcast.\n\n3:08:34.900 --> 3:08:36.900\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n3:08:36.900 --> 3:08:38.860\n from Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n3:08:38.860 --> 3:08:42.860\n About the idea that what is just and what is legal\n\n3:08:42.860 --> 3:08:44.980\n are not always the same thing.\n\n3:08:44.980 --> 3:08:49.340\n He said, never forget that what Hitler did in Germany\n\n3:08:49.340 --> 3:08:50.220\n was legal.\n\n3:08:50.220 --> 3:09:17.220\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
