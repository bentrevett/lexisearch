a professor of bioinformatics\n\n00:06.980 --> 00:09.740\n and computational biology at WPI,\n\n00:09.740 --> 00:13.540\n where he specializes in bioinformatics of complex disease,\n\n00:13.540 --> 00:16.300\n computational genomics, systems biology,\n\n00:16.300 --> 00:18.540\n and biomedical data analytics.\n\n00:18.540 --> 00:22.080\n He loves biology, he loves computing,\n\n00:22.080 --> 00:26.140\n plus he is Russian and recites a poem in Russian\n\n00:26.140 --> 00:27.760\n at the end of the podcast.\n\n00:27.760 --> 00:31.080\n What else could you possibly ask for in this

impactful, brilliant work of 2020\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:09.000\n are the biologists who study viruses without an agenda,\n\n01:09.160 --> 01:11.800\n without much sleep, to be honest,\n\n01:11.800 --> 01:14.460\n just a pure passion for scientific discovery\n\n01:14.460 --> 01:18.400\n and exploration of the mysteries within viruses.\n\n01:18.400 --> 01:21.340\n Viruses are both terrifying and beautiful.\n\n01:21.340 --> 01:22.960\n Terrifying because they can threaten\n\n01:22.960 --> 01:25.120\n the fabric of human civilization,\n\n01:25.120 --> 01:27.840\n both biological and psychological.\n\n01:27.840 --> 01:30.480\n Beautiful because they give us insights\n\n01:30.480 --> 01:32.920\n into the nature of life on Earth\n\n01:32.920 --> 01:35.900\n and perhaps even extraterrestrial life\n\n01:35.900 --> 01:37.960\n of the not so intelligent variety\n\n01:37.960 --> 01:39.560\n that might meet us one day\n\n01:39.560 --> 01:41.520\n as we explore the habitable planets\n\n01:41.520 --> 01:43.760\n and moons in our universe.\n\n01:43.760 --> 01:45.800\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:45.800 --> 01:49.040\n review it on Apple Podcast,

conversation with Dmitry Korkin.\n\n01:57.920 --> 02:00.680\n It's often said that proteins\n\n02:00.680 --> 02:04.200\n and the amino acid residues that make them up\n\n02:04.200 --> 02:06.400\n are the building blocks of life.\n\n02:06.400 --> 02:08.000\n Do you think of proteins in this way\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:11.160\n as the basic building blocks of life?\n\n02:11.160 --> 02:12.200\n Yes and no.\n\n02:12.200 --> 02:16.300\n So the proteins indeed is the basic unit,\n\n02:16.300 --> 02:20.480\n biological unit that carries out\n\n02:20.480 --> 02:22.800\n important function of the cell.\n\n02:22.800 --> 02:25.800\n However, through studying the proteins\n\n02:25.800 --> 02:29.360\n and comparing the proteins across different species,\n\n02:29.360 --> 02:31.440\n across different kingdoms,\n\n02:31.440 --> 02:34.640\n you realize that proteins are actually\n\n02:34.640 --> 02:36.760\n much more complicated.\n\n02:36.760 --> 02:41.760\n So they have so called modular complexity.\n\n02:42.280 --> 02:47.280\n And so what I mean by that is an average protein\n\n02:47.280 --> 02:52.280\n consists of several structural units.\n\n02:54.760 --> 02:57.440\n So we call them protein domains.\n\n02:57.440 --> 03:02.440\n And so you can imagine a protein as a string of beads\n\n03:02.580 --> 03:04.860\n where each bead is a protein domain.\n\n03:05.760 --> 03:10.240\n And in the past 20 years,\n\n03:10.240 --> 03:13.040\n scientists have been studying\n\n03:13.040 --> 03:15.040\n the nature of the protein domains\n\n03:15.040 --> 03:19.480\n because we realize that it's the unit.\n\n03:19.480 --> 03:22.120\n Because if you look at the functions, right?\n\n03:22.120 --> 03:25.880\n So many proteins have more than one function\n\n03:25.880 --> 03:29.440\n and those protein functions are often carried out\n\n03:29.440 --> 03:31.560\n by those protein domains.\n\n03:31.560 --> 03:36.560\n So we also see that in the evolution,\n\n03:37.320 --> 03:40.160\n those proteins domains get shuffled.\n\n03:40.160 --> 03:43.460\n So they act actually as a unit.\n\n03:43.460 --> 03:45.280\n Also from the structural perspective, right?\n\n03:45.280 --> 03:50.280\n So some people think of a protein\n\n03:50.960 --> 03:55.320\n as a sort of a globular molecule,\n\n03:55.320 --> 03:56.800\n but as a matter of fact,\n\n03:56.800 --> 04:01.800\n is the globular part of this protein is a protein domain.\n\n04:02.500 --> 04:06.000\n So we often have this, again,\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:09.600\n the collection of this protein domains\n\n04:09.600 --> 04:14.600\n align on a string as beads.\n\n04:14.800 --> 04:17.880\n And the protein domains are made up of amino acid residue.\n\n04:17.880 --> 04:18.720\n So we're talking about.\n\n04:18.720 --> 04:20.640\n So this is the basic,\n\n04:20.640 --> 04:22.600\n so you're saying the protein domain\n\n04:22.600 --> 04:25.640\n is the basic building block of the function\n\n04:25.640 --> 04:28.320\n that we think about proteins doing.\n\n04:28.320 --> 04:30.200\n So of course you can always talk\n\n04:30.200 --> 04:31.520\n about different building blocks.\n\n04:31.520 --> 04:32.880\n It's turtles all the way down.\n\n04:32.880 --> 04:35.400\n But there's a point where there is,\n\n04:36.280 --> 04:37.680\n at the point of the hierarchy\n\n04:37.680 --> 04:42.680\n where it's the most, the cleanest element block\n\n04:43.640 --> 04:46.240\n based on which you can put them together\n\n04:46.240 --> 04:49.200\n in different kinds of ways to form complex function.\n\n04:49.200 --> 04:50.880\n And you're saying protein domains,\n\n04:50.880 --> 04:55.160\n why is that not talked about as often in popular culture?\n\n04:55.160 --> 04:58.240\n Well, there are several perspectives on this.\n\n04:59.280 --> 05:03.200\n And one of course is the historical perspective, right?\n\n05:03.200 --> 05:07.800\n So historically scientists have been able\n\n05:07.800 --> 05:10.120\n to structurally resolved\n\n05:10.120 --> 05:14.240\n to obtain the 3D coordinates of a protein\n\n05:14.240 --> 05:17.520\n for smaller proteins.\n\n05:17.520 --> 05:21.000\n And smaller proteins tend to be a single domain protein.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\n So we have a protein equal to a protein domain.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.040\n And so because of that,\n\n05:26.040 --> 05:29.640\n the initial suspicion was that the proteins are,\n\n05:29.640 --> 05:31.680\n they have globular shapes\n\n05:31.680 --> 05:36.680\n and the more of smaller proteins you obtain structurally,\n\n05:36.840 --> 05:41.720\n the more you became convinced that that's the case.\n\n05:41.720 --> 05:45.720\n And only later when we started having\n\n05:47.920 --> 05:49.640\n alternative approaches.\n\n05:49.640 --> 05:54.640\n So the traditional ones are X ray crystallography\n\n05:55.920 --> 05:57.320\n and NMR spectroscopy.\n\n05:57.320 --> 06:02.000\n So this is sort of the two main techniques\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.440\n that give us the 3D coordinates.\n\n06:04.440 --> 06:07.760\n But nowadays there's huge breakthrough\n\n06:07.760 --> 06:10.480\n in cryo electron microscopy.\n\n06:10.480 --> 06:13.840\n So the more advanced methods that allow us\n\n06:13.840 --> 06:18.840\n to get into the 3D shapes of much larger molecules,\n\n06:21.560 --> 06:23.480\n molecular complexes,\n\n06:23.480 --> 06:28.120\n just to give you one of the common examples\n\n06:28.120 --> 06:29.440\n for this year, right?\n\n06:29.440 --> 06:32.760\n So the first experimental structure\n\n06:32.760 --> 06:35.920\n of a SARS COVID 2 protein\n\n06:35.920 --> 06:40.160\n was the cryo EM structure of the S protein.\n\n06:40.160 --> 06:41.960\n So the spike protein.\n\n06:41.960 --> 06:46.320\n And so it was solved very quickly.\n\n06:46.320 --> 06:49.480\n And the reason for that is the advancement\n\n06:49.480 --> 06:53.920\n of this technology is pretty spectacular.\n\n06:53.920 --> 06:57.480\n How many domains does the, is it more than one domain?\n\n06:57.480 --> 06:58.320\n Oh yes.\n\n06:58.320 --> 07:01.320\n Oh yes, I mean, so it's a very complex structure.\n\n07:01.320 --> 07:06.320\n And we, you know, on top of the complexity\n\n07:06.480 --> 07:08.520\n of a single protein, right?\n\n07:08.520 --> 07:13.520\n So this structure is actually is a complex, is a trimer.\n\n07:13.720 --> 07:17.640\n So it needs to form a trimer in order to function properly.\n\n07:17.640 --> 07:18.720\n What's a complex?\n\n07:18.720 --> 07:22.880\n So a complex is a glomeration of multiple proteins.\n\n07:22.880 --> 07:27.880\n And so we can have the same protein copied in multiple,\n\n07:29.280 --> 07:32.080\n you know, made up in multiple copies\n\n07:32.080 --> 07:36.160\n and forming something that we called a homo oligomer.\n\n07:36.160 --> 07:38.120\n Homo means the same, right?\n\n07:38.120 --> 07:42.800\n So in this case, so the spike protein is the,\n\n07:42.800 --> 07:46.720\n is an example of a homo tetram, homo trimer, sorry.\n\n07:46.720 --> 07:48.120\n So you need three copies of it?\n\n07:48.120 --> 07:48.960\n Three copies.\n\n07:48.960 --> 07:50.040\n In order to.\n\n07:50.040 --> 07:50.880\n Exactly.\n\n07:50.880 --> 07:52.760\n We have these three chains,\n\n07:52.760 --> 07:56.800\n the three molecular chains coupled together\n\n07:56.800 --> 07:58.480\n and performing the function.\n\n07:58.480 --> 08:02.380\n That's what, when you look at this protein from the top,\n\n08:02.380 --> 08:03.920\n you see a perfect triangle.\n\n08:03.920 --> 08:04.760\n Yeah.\n\n08:04.760 --> 08:07.120\n So, but other, you know,\n\n08:07.120 --> 08:10.640\n so other complexes are made up of, you know,\n\n08:10.640 --> 08:12.840\n different proteins.\n\n08:12.840 --> 08:15.400\n Some of them are completely different.\n\n08:15.400 --> 08:16.920\n Some of them are similar.\n\n08:16.920 --> 08:18.880\n The hemoglobin molecule, right?\n\n08:18.880 --> 08:21.880\n So it's actually, it's a protein complex.\n\n08:21.880 --> 08:25.760\n It's made of four basic subunits.\n\n08:25.760 --> 08:29.040\n Two of them are identical to each other.\n\n08:29.040 --> 08:30.800\n Two other identical to each other,\n\n08:30.800 --> 08:32.820\n but they are also similar to each other,\n\n08:32.820 --> 08:36.960\n which sort of gives us some ideas about the evolution\n\n08:36.960 --> 08:40.640\n of this, you know, of this molecule.\n\n08:40.640 --> 08:44.000\n And perhaps, so one of the hypothesis is that, you know,\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:48.280\n in the past, it was just a homo tetramer, right?\n\n08:48.280 --> 08:50.840\n So four identical copies,\n\n08:50.840 --> 08:55.520\n and then it became, you know, sort of modified,\n\n08:55.520 --> 08:58.520\n it became mutated over the time\n\n08:58.520 --> 09:00.160\n and became more specialized.\n\n09:00.160 --> 09:02.560\n Can we linger on the spike protein for a little bit?\n\n09:02.560 --> 09:04.940\n Is there something interesting\n\n09:04.940 --> 09:06.960\n or like beautiful you find about it?\n\n09:06.960 --> 09:07.880\n I mean, first of all,\n\n09:07.880 --> 09:10.960\n it's an incredibly challenging protein.\n\n09:10.960 --> 09:15.960\n And so we, as a part of our sort of research\n\n09:16.120 --> 09:20.200\n to understand the structural basis of this virus,\n\n09:20.200 --> 09:22.760\n to sort of decode, structurally decode,\n\n09:22.760 --> 09:27.560\n every single protein in its proteome,\n\n09:27.560 --> 09:31.800\n which, you know, we've been working on this spike protein.\n\n09:31.800 --> 09:36.800\n And one of the main challenges was that the cryoEM data\n\n09:36.800 --> 09:41.800\n allows us to reconstruct or to obtain the 3D coordinates\n\n09:44.640 --> 09:48.040\n of roughly two thirds of the protein.\n\n09:48.040 --> 09:51.960\n The rest of the one third of this protein,\n\n09:51.960 --> 09:56.960\n it's a part that is buried into the membrane of the virus\n\n09:58.400 --> 10:01.560\n and of the viral envelope.\n\n10:01.560 --> 10:06.560\n And it also has a lot of unstable structures around it.\n\n10:06.920 --> 10:08.640\n So it's chemically interacting somehow\n\n10:08.640 --> 10:10.160\n with whatever the hex is connecting to.\n\n10:10.160 --> 10:12.800\n Yeah, so people are still trying to understand.\n\n10:12.800 --> 10:17.800\n So the nature of, and the role of this one third,\n\n10:18.600 --> 10:23.120\n because the top part, you know, the primary function\n\n10:23.120 --> 10:28.120\n is to get attached to the ACE2 receptor, human receptor.\n\n10:28.120 --> 10:32.600\n There is also beautiful mechanics\n\n10:32.600 --> 10:34.720\n of how this thing happens, right?\n\n10:34.720 --> 10:39.720\n So because there are three different copies of this chains,\n\n10:39.800 --> 10:43.480\n you know, there are three different domains, right?\n\n10:43.480 --> 10:44.800\n So we're talking about domains.\n\n10:44.800 --> 10:47.840\n So this is the receptor binding domains, RBDs,\n\n10:47.840 --> 10:52.840\n that gets untangled and get ready to get attached\n\n10:53.840 --> 10:55.400\n to the receptor.\n\n10:55.400 --> 11:00.400\n And now they are not necessarily going in a sync mode.\n\n11:02.760 --> 11:04.080\n As a matter of fact.\n\n11:04.080 --> 11:05.240\n It's asynchronous.\n\n11:05.240 --> 11:10.240\n So yes, and this is where another level of complexity\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:16.000\n comes into play because right now what we see is,\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:20.520\n we typically see just one of the arms going out\n\n11:20.520 --> 11:25.520\n and getting ready to be attached to the ACE2 receptors.\n\n11:27.560 --> 11:30.360\n However, there was a recent mutation\n\n11:30.360 --> 11:35.080\n that people studied in that spike protein.\n\n11:35.080 --> 11:40.080\n And very recently, a group from UMass Medical School\n\n11:43.560 --> 11:45.280\n will happen to collaborate with groups.\n\n11:45.280 --> 11:47.240\n So this is a group of Jeremy Lubin\n\n11:47.240 --> 11:50.640\n and a number of other faculty.\n\n11:51.560 --> 11:56.560\n They actually solve the mutated structure of the spike.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:03.000\n And they showed that actually, because of these mutations,\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:08.000\n you have more than one arms opening up.\n\n12:08.880 --> 12:13.880\n And so now, so the frequency of two arms going up\n\n12:13.880 --> 12:17.200\n increase quite drastically.\n\n12:17.200 --> 12:18.040\n Interesting.\n\n12:18.040 --> 12:20.120\n Does that change the dynamics somehow?\n\n12:20.120 --> 12:22.920\n It potentially can change the dynamics\n\n12:22.920 --> 12:27.280\n because now you have two possible opportunities\n\n12:27.280 --> 12:30.000\n to get attached to the ACE2 receptor.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:34.120\n It's a very complex molecular process, mechanistic process.\n\n12:34.120 --> 12:38.280\n But the first step of this process is the attachment\n\n12:38.280 --> 12:42.560\n of this spike protein, of the spike trimer\n\n12:42.560 --> 12:46.600\n to the human ACE2 receptor.\n\n12:46.600 --> 12:48.880\n So this is a molecule that sits\n\n12:48.880 --> 12:51.920\n on the surface of the human cell.\n\n12:51.920 --> 12:54.720\n And that's essentially what initiates,\n\n12:54.720 --> 12:58.880\n what triggers the whole process of encapsulation.\n\n12:58.880 --> 13:01.440\n If this was dating, this would be the first date.\n\n13:01.440 --> 13:03.160\n So this is the...\n\n13:03.160 --> 13:04.200\n In a way.\n\n13:04.200 --> 13:05.640\n Yes.\n\n13:05.640 --> 13:07.920\n So is it possible to have the spike protein\n\n13:07.920 --> 13:10.640\n just like floating about on its own?\n\n13:10.640 --> 13:14.680\n Or does it need that interactability with the membrane?\n\n13:14.680 --> 13:16.920\n Yeah, so it needs to be attached,\n\n13:16.920 --> 13:19.040\n at least as far as I know.\n\n13:19.040 --> 13:23.320\n But when you get this thing attached on the surface,\n\n13:23.320 --> 13:25.120\n there is also a lot of dynamics\n\n13:25.120 --> 13:28.200\n on how it sits on the surface.\n\n13:28.200 --> 13:32.200\n So for example, there was a recent work in,\n\n13:32.200 --> 13:35.800\n again, where people use the cryolectron microscopy\n\n13:35.800 --> 13:38.960\n to get the first glimpse of the overall structure.\n\n13:38.960 --> 13:41.600\n It's a very low res, but you still get\n\n13:41.600 --> 13:45.160\n some interesting details about the surface,\n\n13:45.160 --> 13:47.040\n about what is happening inside,\n\n13:47.040 --> 13:50.760\n because we have literally no clue until recent work\n\n13:50.760 --> 13:54.520\n about how the capsid is organized.\n\n13:54.520 --> 13:55.360\n What's a capsid?\n\n13:55.360 --> 13:56.720\n So a capsid is essentially,\n\n13:56.720 --> 14:01.040\n it's the inner core of the viral particle\n\n14:01.040 --> 14:05.000\n where there is the RNA of the virus,\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:09.200\n and it's protected by another protein, N protein,\n\n14:10.280 --> 14:13.440\n that essentially acts as a shield.\n\n14:13.440 --> 14:16.520\n But now we are learning more and more,\n\n14:16.520 --> 14:18.600\n so it's actually, it's not just this shield,\n\n14:18.600 --> 14:21.800\n it potentially is used for the stability\n\n14:21.800 --> 14:25.040\n of the outer shell of the virus.\n\n14:25.040 --> 14:27.840\n So it's pretty complicated.\n\n14:27.840 --> 14:30.480\n And I mean, understanding all of this is really useful\n\n14:30.480 --> 14:33.000\n for trying to figure out like developing a vaccine\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:34.680\n or some kind of drug to attack,\n\n14:34.680 --> 14:36.040\n any aspects of this, right?\n\n14:36.040 --> 14:39.640\n So, I mean, there are many different implications to that.\n\n14:39.640 --> 14:43.040\n First of all, it's important to understand\n\n14:43.040 --> 14:44.560\n the virus itself, right?\n\n14:44.560 --> 14:49.560\n So in order to understand how it acts,\n\n14:51.560 --> 14:55.320\n what is the overall mechanistic process\n\n14:55.320 --> 14:57.320\n of this virus replication,\n\n14:57.320 --> 15:00.560\n of this virus proliferation to the cell, right?\n\n15:00.560 --> 15:03.000\n So that's one aspect.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:06.480\n The other aspect is designing new treatments.\n\n15:06.480 --> 15:09.040\n So one of the possible treatments\n\n15:09.040 --> 15:12.480\n is designing nanoparticles.\n\n15:12.480 --> 15:17.200\n And so some nanoparticles that will resemble the viral shape\n\n15:17.200 --> 15:19.520\n that would have the spike integrated,\n\n15:19.520 --> 15:23.680\n and essentially would act as a competitor to the real virus\n\n15:23.680 --> 15:26.680\n by blocking the ACE2 receptors,\n\n15:26.680 --> 15:30.400\n and thus preventing the real virus entering the cell.\n\n15:30.400 --> 15:32.920\n Now, there are also, you know,\n\n15:32.920 --> 15:35.600\n there is a very interesting direction\n\n15:35.600 --> 15:38.320\n in looking at the membrane,\n\n15:38.320 --> 15:40.960\n at the envelope portion of the protein\n\n15:40.960 --> 15:44.880\n and attacking its M protein.\n\n15:44.880 --> 15:48.320\n So there are, you know, to give you a, you know,\n\n15:48.320 --> 15:50.120\n sort of a brief overview,\n\n15:50.120 --> 15:52.320\n there are four structural proteins.\n\n15:52.320 --> 15:54.560\n These are the proteins that made up\n\n15:54.560 --> 15:58.160\n a structure of the virus.\n\n15:58.160 --> 16:02.920\n So SPIKE, S protein that acts as a trimer,\n\n16:02.920 --> 16:04.880\n so it needs three copies.\n\n16:06.080 --> 16:09.720\n E, envelope protein that acts as a pantomime,\n\n16:09.720 --> 16:13.400\n so it needs five copies to act properly.\n\n16:13.400 --> 16:18.400\n M is a membrane protein, it forms dimers,\n\n16:18.600 --> 16:20.560\n and actually it forms beautiful lattice.\n\n16:20.560 --> 16:22.480\n And this is something that we've been studying\n\n16:22.480 --> 16:24.520\n and we are seeing it in simulations.\n\n16:24.520 --> 16:26.920\n It actually forms a very nice grid\n\n16:26.920 --> 16:30.600\n or, you know, threads, you know,\n\n16:30.600 --> 16:33.600\n of different dimers attached next to each other.\n\n16:33.600 --> 16:34.960\n Just a bunch of copies of each other,\n\n16:34.960 --> 16:36.960\n and they naturally, when you have a bunch of copies\n\n16:36.960 --> 16:38.960\n of each other, they form an interesting lattice.\n\n16:38.960 --> 16:39.800\n Exactly.\n\n16:39.800 --> 16:42.280\n And, you know, if you think about this, right?\n\n16:42.280 --> 16:47.280\n So this complex, you know, the viral shape\n\n16:48.160 --> 16:52.160\n needs to be organized somehow, self organized somehow, right?\n\n16:52.160 --> 16:56.160\n So it, you know, if it was a completely random process,\n\n16:56.160 --> 17:01.160\n you know, you probably wouldn't have the envelope shell\n\n17:02.080 --> 17:03.920\n of the ellipsoid shape, you know,\n\n17:03.920 --> 17:05.880\n you would have something, you know,\n\n17:05.880 --> 17:07.600\n pretty random, right, shape.\n\n17:07.600 --> 17:10.560\n So there is some, you know, regularity\n\n17:10.560 --> 17:15.560\n in how this, you know, how this M dimers\n\n17:16.720 --> 17:18.480\n get to attach to each other\n\n17:18.480 --> 17:20.520\n in a very specific directed way.\n\n17:20.520 --> 17:21.920\n Is that understood at all?\n\n17:23.080 --> 17:24.280\n It's not understood.\n\n17:24.280 --> 17:28.400\n We are now, we've been working in the past six months\n\n17:28.400 --> 17:30.160\n since, you know, we met, actually,\n\n17:30.160 --> 17:33.400\n this is where we started working on trying to understand\n\n17:33.400 --> 17:36.280\n the overall structure of the envelope\n\n17:36.280 --> 17:40.640\n and the key components that made up this, you know,\n\n17:40.640 --> 17:41.480\n structure.\n\n17:41.480 --> 17:43.240\n Wait, does the envelope also have the lattice structure\n\n17:43.240 --> 17:44.080\n or no?\n\n17:44.080 --> 17:47.360\n So the envelope is essentially is the outer shell\n\n17:47.360 --> 17:48.800\n of the viral particle.\n\n17:48.800 --> 17:51.600\n The N, the nucleocapsid protein,\n\n17:51.600 --> 17:53.960\n is something that is inside.\n\n17:53.960 --> 17:54.800\n Got it.\n\n17:54.800 --> 17:59.520\n But get that, the N is likely to interact with M.\n\n17:59.520 --> 18:01.480\n Does it go M and E?\n\n18:01.480 --> 18:02.880\n Like, where's the E and the M?\n\n18:02.880 --> 18:05.640\n So E, those different proteins,\n\n18:05.640 --> 18:10.640\n they occur in different copies on the viral particle.\n\n18:10.800 --> 18:13.960\n So E, this pentamer complex,\n\n18:13.960 --> 18:18.960\n we only have two or three, maybe, per each particle, okay?\n\n18:18.960 --> 18:23.960\n We have thousand or so of M dimers\n\n18:24.520 --> 18:26.600\n that essentially made up,\n\n18:26.600 --> 18:30.920\n that makes up the entire, you know, outer shell.\n\n18:30.920 --> 18:33.680\n So most of the outer shell is the M.\n\n18:33.680 --> 18:34.520\n M dimer.\n\n18:34.520 --> 18:35.640\n And the M protein.\n\n18:35.640 --> 18:38.160\n When you say particle, that's the virion,\n\n18:38.160 --> 18:40.120\n the virus, the individual virus.\n\n18:40.120 --> 18:40.960\n It's a single, yes.\n\n18:40.960 --> 18:43.640\n Single element of the virus, it's a single virus.\n\n18:43.640 --> 18:45.080\n Single virus, right.\n\n18:45.080 --> 18:50.080\n And we have about, you know, roughly 50 to 90 spike trimmers.\n\n18:50.840 --> 18:51.680\n Right?\n\n18:51.680 --> 18:54.000\n So when you, you know, when you show a...\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.040\n Per virus particle.\n\n18:55.040 --> 18:56.560\n Per virus particle.\n\n18:56.560 --> 18:58.680\n Sorry, what did you say, 50 to 90?\n\n18:58.680 --> 19:00.680\n 50 to 90, right?\n\n19:00.680 --> 19:04.000\n So this is how this thing is organized.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.400\n And so now, typically, right,\n\n19:06.400 --> 19:11.400\n so you see these, the antibodies that target,\n\n19:11.480 --> 19:13.240\n you know, spike protein,\n\n19:13.240 --> 19:15.200\n certain parts of the spike protein,\n\n19:15.200 --> 19:17.960\n but there could be some, also some treatments, right?\n\n19:17.960 --> 19:22.000\n So these are, you know, these are small molecules\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:27.000\n that bind strategic parts of these proteins,\n\n19:27.520 --> 19:29.680\n disrupting its function.\n\n19:29.680 --> 19:34.040\n So one of the promising directions,\n\n19:34.040 --> 19:35.600\n it's one of the newest directions,\n\n19:35.600 --> 19:40.600\n is actually targeting the M dimer of the protein.\n\n19:40.600 --> 19:44.120\n Targeting the proteins that make up this outer shell.\n\n19:44.120 --> 19:47.640\n Because if you're able to destroy the outer shell,\n\n19:47.640 --> 19:52.160\n you're essentially destroying the viral particle itself.\n\n19:52.160 --> 19:56.720\n So preventing it from, you know, functioning at all.\n\n19:56.720 --> 19:59.160\n So that's, you think is,\n\n19:59.160 --> 20:01.440\n from a sort of cyber security perspective,\n\n20:01.440 --> 20:02.960\n virus security perspective,\n\n20:02.960 --> 20:05.160\n that's the best attack vector?\n\n20:05.160 --> 20:08.440\n Is, or like, that's a promising attack vector?\n\n20:08.440 --> 20:09.280\n I would say, yeah.\n\n20:09.280 --> 20:12.680\n So, I mean, there's still tons of research needs to be,\n\n20:12.680 --> 20:14.000\n you know, to be done.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.560\n But yes, I think, you know, so.\n\n20:16.560 --> 20:18.880\n There's more attack surface, I guess.\n\n20:18.880 --> 20:19.880\n More attack surface.\n\n20:19.880 --> 20:22.280\n But, you know, from our analysis,\n\n20:22.280 --> 20:24.200\n from other evolutionary analysis,\n\n20:24.200 --> 20:28.000\n this protein is evolutionarily more stable\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:31.200\n compared to the, say, to the spike protein.\n\n20:31.200 --> 20:35.520\n Oh, and stable means a more static target?\n\n20:35.520 --> 20:38.400\n Well, yeah, so it doesn't change.\n\n20:38.400 --> 20:42.120\n It doesn't evolve from the evolutionary perspective\n\n20:42.120 --> 20:46.000\n so drastically as, for example, the spike protein.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:47.960\n There's a bunch of stuff in the news\n\n20:47.960 --> 20:51.400\n about mutations of the virus in the United Kingdom.\n\n20:51.400 --> 20:54.160\n I also saw in South Africa something.\n\n20:54.160 --> 20:55.440\n Maybe that was yesterday.\n\n20:56.360 --> 21:00.200\n You just kind of mentioned about stability and so on.\n\n21:00.200 --> 21:02.800\n Which aspects of this are mutatable\n\n21:02.800 --> 21:07.600\n and which aspects, if mutated, become more dangerous?\n\n21:07.600 --> 21:09.280\n And maybe even zooming out,\n\n21:09.280 --> 21:12.080\n what are your thoughts and knowledge and ideas\n\n21:12.080 --> 21:13.680\n about the way it's mutated,\n\n21:13.680 --> 21:15.360\n all the news that we've been hearing?\n\n21:15.360 --> 21:18.520\n Are you worried about it from a biological perspective?\n\n21:18.520 --> 21:21.280\n Are you worried about it from a human perspective?\n\n21:21.280 --> 21:26.280\n So, I mean, you know, mutations are sort of a general way\n\n21:26.320 --> 21:28.640\n for these viruses to evolve, right?\n\n21:28.640 --> 21:32.680\n So, it's, you know, it's essentially,\n\n21:32.680 --> 21:34.760\n this is the way they evolve.\n\n21:34.760 --> 21:38.680\n This is the way they were able to jump\n\n21:38.680 --> 21:42.080\n from one species to another.\n\n21:42.080 --> 21:46.800\n We also see some recent jumps.\n\n21:46.800 --> 21:50.000\n There were some incidents of this virus jumping\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:51.880\n from human to dogs.\n\n21:51.880 --> 21:55.880\n So, you know, there is some danger in those jumps\n\n21:55.880 --> 21:59.520\n because every time it jumps, it also mutates, right?\n\n21:59.520 --> 22:04.400\n So, when it jumps to the species\n\n22:04.400 --> 22:06.160\n and jumps back, right?\n\n22:06.160 --> 22:08.320\n So, it acquires some mutations\n\n22:08.320 --> 22:13.320\n that are sort of driven by the environment\n\n22:14.360 --> 22:16.360\n of a new host, right?\n\n22:16.360 --> 22:19.280\n And it's different from the human environment.\n\n22:19.280 --> 22:21.480\n And so, we don't know whether the mutations\n\n22:21.480 --> 22:24.920\n that are acquired in the new species\n\n22:24.920 --> 22:28.160\n are neutral with respect to the human host\n\n22:28.160 --> 22:32.080\n or maybe, you know, maybe damaging.\n\n22:32.080 --> 22:36.560\n Yeah, change is always scary, but so are you worried about,\n\n22:36.560 --> 22:38.960\n I mean, it seems like because the spread is,\n\n22:38.960 --> 22:42.200\n during winter now, seems to be exceptionally high\n\n22:43.560 --> 22:46.760\n and especially with a vaccine just around the corner\n\n22:46.760 --> 22:49.160\n already being actually deployed,\n\n22:49.160 --> 22:53.000\n is there some worry that this puts evolutionary pressure,\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:58.000\n selective pressure on the virus for it to mutate?\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:00.440\n Is that a source of worry?\n\n23:00.440 --> 23:03.440\n Well, I mean, there is always this thought\n\n23:03.440 --> 23:08.440\n in the scientist's mind, you know, what will happen, right?\n\n23:08.720 --> 23:12.520\n So, I know there've been discussions\n\n23:12.520 --> 23:17.520\n about sort of the arms race between the ability\n\n23:17.600 --> 23:22.600\n of the humanity to get vaccinated faster\n\n23:22.600 --> 23:27.600\n than the virus, you know, essentially, you know,\n\n23:27.600 --> 23:31.600\n it becomes, you know, resistant to the vaccine.\n\n23:34.200 --> 23:39.200\n I mean, I don't worry that much simply because,\n\n23:40.920 --> 23:44.920\n you know, there is not that much evidence to that.\n\n23:44.920 --> 23:47.440\n To aggressive mutation around the vaccine.\n\n23:47.440 --> 23:49.960\n Exactly, you know, obviously there are mutations\n\n23:49.960 --> 23:54.960\n around the vaccine, so the reason we get vaccinated\n\n23:56.080 --> 24:00.080\n every year against the seasonal mutations, right?\n\n24:01.280 --> 24:05.280\n But, you know, I think it's important to study it.\n\n24:06.120 --> 24:07.120\n No doubts, right?\n\n24:07.120 --> 24:10.120\n So, I think one of the, you know, to me,\n\n24:10.120 --> 24:14.120\n and again, I might be biased because, you know,\n\n24:14.120 --> 24:17.120\n we've been trying to do that as well,\n\n24:17.120 --> 24:20.120\n so, but one of the critical directions\n\n24:20.120 --> 24:23.920\n in understanding the virus is to understand its evolution\n\n24:23.920 --> 24:27.480\n in order to sort of understand the mechanisms,\n\n24:27.480 --> 24:30.960\n the key mechanisms that lead the virus to jump,\n\n24:30.960 --> 24:34.240\n you know, the Nordic viruses to jump from species,\n\n24:34.240 --> 24:37.440\n from species to another, that the mechanisms\n\n24:37.440 --> 24:42.440\n that lead the virus to become resistant to vaccines,\n\n24:42.480 --> 24:44.680\n also to treatments, right?\n\n24:44.680 --> 24:48.520\n And hopefully that knowledge will enable us\n\n24:48.520 --> 24:52.520\n to sort of forecast the evolutionary traces,\n\n24:52.520 --> 24:55.160\n the future evolutionary traces of this virus.\n\n24:55.160 --> 24:58.080\n I mean, what, from a biological perspective,\n\n24:58.080 --> 24:59.320\n this might be a dumb question,\n\n24:59.320 --> 25:04.320\n but is there parts of the virus that if souped up,\n\n25:05.080 --> 25:09.080\n like through mutation, could make it more effective\n\n25:09.080 --> 25:09.920\n at doing its job?\n\n25:09.920 --> 25:12.520\n We're talking about this specific coronavirus\n\n25:12.520 --> 25:14.880\n because we were talking about the different, like,\n\n25:14.880 --> 25:18.440\n the membrane, the M protein, the E protein,\n\n25:18.440 --> 25:23.440\n the N and the S, the spike, is there some?\n\n25:24.080 --> 25:27.880\n And there are 20 or so more in addition to that.\n\n25:27.880 --> 25:29.840\n But is that a dumb way to look at it?\n\n25:29.840 --> 25:34.520\n Like, which of these, if mutated,\n\n25:34.520 --> 25:39.520\n could have the greatest impact, potentially damaging impact,\n\n25:39.640 --> 25:41.520\n on the effectiveness of the virus?\n\n25:41.520 --> 25:44.520\n So it's actually, it's a very good question\n\n25:44.520 --> 25:48.120\n because, and the short answer is, we don't know yet.\n\n25:48.120 --> 25:51.560\n But of course there is capacity of this virus\n\n25:51.560 --> 25:53.560\n to become more efficient.\n\n25:53.560 --> 25:56.680\n The reason for that is, you know,\n\n25:56.680 --> 25:59.760\n so if you look at the virus, I mean, it's a machine, right?\n\n25:59.760 --> 26:03.520\n So it's a machine that does a lot of different functions,\n\n26:03.520 --> 26:06.520\n and many of these functions are sort of nearly perfect,\n\n26:06.520 --> 26:07.840\n but they're not perfect.\n\n26:07.840 --> 26:11.360\n And those mutations can have the greatest impact\n\n26:11.360 --> 26:14.120\n and make those functions more perfect.\n\n26:14.120 --> 26:18.240\n For example, the attachment to ACE2 receptor, right,\n\n26:18.240 --> 26:19.400\n of the spike, right?\n\n26:19.400 --> 26:24.400\n So, you know, has this virus reached the efficiency\n\n26:28.360 --> 26:31.560\n in which the attachment is carried out?\n\n26:31.560 --> 26:36.080\n Or there are some mutations that still to be discovered,\n\n26:36.080 --> 26:41.080\n right, that will make this attachment sort of stronger,\n\n26:41.920 --> 26:46.920\n or, you know, something more, in a way more efficient\n\n26:48.560 --> 26:51.880\n from the point of view of this virus functioning.\n\n26:51.880 --> 26:54.640\n That's sort of the obvious example.\n\n26:54.640 --> 26:57.480\n But if you look at each of these proteins,\n\n26:57.480 --> 26:58.840\n I mean, it's there for a reason,\n\n26:58.840 --> 27:00.760\n it performs certain function.\n\n27:00.760 --> 27:05.760\n And it could be that certain mutations will, you know,\n\n27:07.120 --> 27:08.480\n enhance this function.\n\n27:08.480 --> 27:11.560\n It could be that some mutations will make this function\n\n27:11.560 --> 27:13.720\n much less efficient, right?\n\n27:13.720 --> 27:15.360\n So that's also the case.\n\n27:16.200 --> 27:18.880\n Let's, since we're talking about the evolutionary history\n\n27:18.880 --> 27:22.720\n of a virus, let's zoom back out\n\n27:22.720 --> 27:25.240\n and look at the evolution of proteins.\n\n27:25.240 --> 27:29.960\n I glanced at this 2010 Nature paper\n\n27:29.960 --> 27:34.320\n on the quote, ongoing expansion of the protein universe.\n\n27:34.320 --> 27:39.320\n And then, you know, it kind of implies and talks about\n\n27:39.480 --> 27:42.520\n that proteins started with a common ancestor,\n\n27:42.520 --> 27:44.720\n which is, you know, kind of interesting.\n\n27:44.720 --> 27:45.960\n It's interesting to think about like,\n\n27:45.960 --> 27:49.840\n even just like the first organic thing\n\n27:49.840 --> 27:51.840\n that started life on Earth.\n\n27:51.840 --> 27:56.000\n And from that, there's now, you know, what is it?\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:59.880\n 3.5 billion years later, there's now millions of proteins.\n\n27:59.880 --> 28:01.320\n And they're still evolving.\n\n28:01.320 --> 28:02.960\n And that's, you know, in part,\n\n28:02.960 --> 28:05.000\n one of the things that you're researching.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:09.200\n Is there something interesting to you about the evolution\n\n28:09.200 --> 28:14.200\n of proteins from this initial ancestor to today?\n\n28:14.600 --> 28:16.280\n Is there something beautiful and insightful\n\n28:16.280 --> 28:18.120\n about this long story?\n\n28:18.120 --> 28:23.120\n So I think, you know, if I were to pick a single keyword\n\n28:24.120 --> 28:29.120\n about protein evolution, I would pick modularity,\n\n28:29.120 --> 28:32.720\n something that we talked about in the beginning.\n\n28:32.720 --> 28:36.960\n And that's the fact that the proteins are no longer\n\n28:36.960 --> 28:41.280\n considered as, you know, as a sequence of letters.\n\n28:41.280 --> 28:45.880\n There are hierarchical complexities\n\n28:45.880 --> 28:48.240\n in the way these proteins are organized.\n\n28:48.240 --> 28:51.720\n And these complexities are actually going\n\n28:51.720 --> 28:53.920\n beyond the protein sequence.\n\n28:53.920 --> 28:57.720\n It's actually going all the way back to the gene,\n\n28:57.720 --> 29:00.000\n to the nucleotide sequence.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:04.840\n And so, you know, again, these protein domains,\n\n29:04.840 --> 29:07.840\n they are not only functional building blocks,\n\n29:07.840 --> 29:09.920\n they are also evolutionary building blocks.\n\n29:09.920 --> 29:12.560\n And so what we see in the sort of,\n\n29:12.560 --> 29:15.120\n in the later stages of evolution,\n\n29:15.120 --> 29:18.720\n I mean, once this stable structurally\n\n29:18.720 --> 29:22.040\n and functionally building blocks were discovered,\n\n29:22.040 --> 29:28.040\n they essentially, they stay, those domains stay as such.\n\n29:28.040 --> 29:31.560\n So that's why if you start comparing different proteins,\n\n29:31.560 --> 29:36.560\n you will see that many of them will have similar fragments.\n\n29:37.400 --> 29:39.640\n And those fragments will correspond to something\n\n29:39.640 --> 29:42.280\n that we call protein domain families.\n\n29:42.280 --> 29:44.040\n And so they are still different\n\n29:44.040 --> 29:48.520\n because you still have mutations and, you know,\n\n29:48.520 --> 29:53.200\n the, you know, different mutations are attributed to,\n\n29:53.200 --> 29:56.200\n to, you know, diversification of the function\n\n29:56.200 --> 29:58.840\n of this, you know, protein domains.\n\n29:58.840 --> 30:03.520\n However, you don't, you very rarely see, you know,\n\n30:03.520 --> 30:07.840\n the evolutionary events that would split\n\n30:07.840 --> 30:10.520\n this domain into fragments because,\n\n30:10.520 --> 30:17.240\n and it's, you know, once you have the domain split,\n\n30:17.240 --> 30:20.240\n you actually, you, you know,\n\n30:20.240 --> 30:24.000\n you can completely cancel out its function\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.600\n or at the very least you can reduce it.\n\n30:26.600 --> 30:29.640\n And that's not, you know, efficient from the point of view\n\n30:29.640 --> 30:32.880\n of the, you know, of the cell functioning.\n\n30:32.880 --> 30:37.240\n So, so the, the, the protein domain level\n\n30:37.240 --> 30:39.160\n is a very important one.\n\n30:39.160 --> 30:42.040\n Now, on top of that, right?\n\n30:42.040 --> 30:44.120\n So if you look at the proteins, right,\n\n30:44.120 --> 30:46.360\n so you have this structural units\n\n30:46.360 --> 30:48.200\n and they carry out the function,\n\n30:48.200 --> 30:51.880\n but then much less is known about things\n\n30:51.880 --> 30:54.400\n that connect this protein domains,\n\n30:54.400 --> 30:56.400\n something that we call linkers.\n\n30:56.400 --> 31:00.760\n And those linkers are completely flexible, you know,\n\n31:00.760 --> 31:03.520\n parts of the protein that nevertheless\n\n31:03.520 --> 31:06.360\n carry out a lot of function.\n\n31:06.360 --> 31:08.040\n So it's like little tails, little heads.\n\n31:08.040 --> 31:09.840\n So, so, so we do have tails.\n\n31:09.840 --> 31:12.320\n So they're called termini, C and N termini.\n\n31:12.320 --> 31:17.160\n So these are things right on the, on, on, on one\n\n31:17.160 --> 31:20.040\n and another ends of the protein sequence.\n\n31:20.040 --> 31:22.560\n So they are also very important.\n\n31:22.560 --> 31:26.320\n So they, they attributed to very specific interactions\n\n31:26.320 --> 31:27.720\n between the proteins.\n\n31:27.720 --> 31:28.560\n So.\n\n31:28.560 --> 31:30.800\n But you're referring to the links between domains.\n\n31:30.800 --> 31:32.600\n That connect the domains.\n\n31:32.600 --> 31:36.160\n And, you know, apart from the, just the,\n\n31:36.160 --> 31:39.840\n the simple perspective, if you have, you know,\n\n31:39.840 --> 31:43.720\n a very short domain, you have, sorry, a very short linker,\n\n31:43.720 --> 31:45.880\n you have two domains next to each other.\n\n31:45.880 --> 31:47.560\n They are forced to be next to each other.\n\n31:47.560 --> 31:49.080\n If you have a very long one,\n\n31:49.080 --> 31:52.040\n you have the domains that are extremely flexible\n\n31:52.040 --> 31:54.320\n and they carry out a lot of sort of\n\n31:54.320 --> 31:56.880\n spatial reorganization, right?\n\n31:56.880 --> 31:58.120\n That's awesome.\n\n31:58.120 --> 32:01.960\n But on top of that, right, just this linker itself,\n\n32:01.960 --> 32:05.760\n because it's so flexible, it actually can adapt\n\n32:05.760 --> 32:07.480\n to a lot of different shapes.\n\n32:07.480 --> 32:11.080\n And therefore it's a, it's a very good interactor\n\n32:11.080 --> 32:14.000\n when it comes to interaction between this protein\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:15.720\n and other protein, right?\n\n32:15.720 --> 32:18.920\n So these things also evolve, you know,\n\n32:18.920 --> 32:23.920\n and they in a way have different sort of laws of\n\n32:25.480 --> 32:30.480\n the driving laws that underlie the evolution\n\n32:30.600 --> 32:33.400\n because they no longer need to,\n\n32:33.400 --> 32:37.120\n to preserve certain structure, right?\n\n32:37.120 --> 32:38.880\n Unlike protein domains.\n\n32:38.880 --> 32:41.480\n And so on top of that,\n\n32:41.480 --> 32:45.840\n you have something that is even less studied.\n\n32:45.840 --> 32:49.640\n And this is something that attribute to,\n\n32:49.640 --> 32:53.240\n to the concept of alternative splicing.\n\n32:53.240 --> 32:54.480\n So alternative splicing.\n\n32:54.480 --> 32:56.920\n So it's a, it's a very cool concept.\n\n32:56.920 --> 33:00.840\n It's something that we've been fascinated about for,\n\n33:00.840 --> 33:03.520\n you know, over a decade in my lab\n\n33:03.520 --> 33:05.520\n and trying to do research with that.\n\n33:05.520 --> 33:08.080\n But so, you know, so typically, you know,\n\n33:08.080 --> 33:12.480\n a simplistic perspective is that one gene\n\n33:12.480 --> 33:16.040\n is equal one protein product, right?\n\n33:16.040 --> 33:18.320\n So you have a gene, you know,\n\n33:18.320 --> 33:21.120\n you transcribe it and translate it\n\n33:21.120 --> 33:22.880\n and it becomes a protein.\n\n33:24.600 --> 33:28.360\n In reality, when we talk about eukaryotes,\n\n33:28.360 --> 33:32.320\n especially sort of more recent eukaryotes\n\n33:32.320 --> 33:33.800\n that are very complex,\n\n33:33.800 --> 33:38.800\n the gene is no longer equal to one protein.\n\n33:40.200 --> 33:45.200\n It actually can produce multiple functionally,\n\n33:47.040 --> 33:50.280\n you know, active protein products.\n\n33:50.280 --> 33:52.720\n And each of them is, you know,\n\n33:52.720 --> 33:57.040\n is called an alternatively spliced product.\n\n33:57.040 --> 34:00.960\n The reason it happens is that if you look at the gene,\n\n34:00.960 --> 34:05.560\n it actually has, it has also blocks.\n\n34:05.560 --> 34:08.320\n And the blocks, some of which,\n\n34:08.320 --> 34:10.680\n and it's essentially, it goes like this.\n\n34:10.680 --> 34:13.880\n So we have a block that will later be translated.\n\n34:13.880 --> 34:15.040\n We call it exon.\n\n34:15.040 --> 34:19.240\n Then we'll have a block that is not translated, cut out.\n\n34:19.240 --> 34:20.400\n We call it intron.\n\n34:20.400 --> 34:22.840\n So we have exon, intron, exon, intron,\n\n34:22.840 --> 34:24.120\n et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, right?\n\n34:24.120 --> 34:26.920\n So sometimes you can have, you know,\n\n34:26.920 --> 34:29.880\n dozens of these exons and introns.\n\n34:29.880 --> 34:32.680\n So what happens is during the process\n\n34:32.680 --> 34:35.800\n when the gene is converted to RNA,\n\n34:37.320 --> 34:41.280\n we have things that are cut out,\n\n34:41.280 --> 34:43.240\n the introns that are cut out,\n\n34:43.240 --> 34:47.160\n and exons that now get assembled together.\n\n34:47.160 --> 34:51.320\n And sometimes we will throw out some of the exons\n\n34:52.320 --> 34:54.600\n and the remaining protein product will become\n\n34:54.600 --> 34:55.440\n still be the same.\n\n34:55.440 --> 34:56.280\n Different.\n\n34:56.280 --> 34:57.120\n Oh, different.\n\n34:57.120 --> 34:59.960\n So now you have fragments of the protein\n\n34:59.960 --> 35:01.360\n that no longer there.\n\n35:01.360 --> 35:03.800\n They were cut out with the introns.\n\n35:03.800 --> 35:07.520\n Sometimes you will essentially take one exon\n\n35:07.520 --> 35:09.840\n and replace it with another one, right?\n\n35:09.840 --> 35:12.600\n So there's some flexibility in this process.\n\n35:12.600 --> 35:17.200\n So that creates a whole new level of complexity.\n\n35:17.200 --> 35:18.040\n Cause now.\n\n35:18.040 --> 35:18.880\n Is this random though?\n\n35:18.880 --> 35:19.720\n Is it random?\n\n35:19.720 --> 35:20.840\n It's not random.\n\n35:20.840 --> 35:24.480\n We, and this is where I think now the appearance\n\n35:24.480 --> 35:27.360\n of this modern single cell\n\n35:27.360 --> 35:31.240\n and before that tissue level sequencing,\n\n35:31.240 --> 35:34.280\n next generation sequencing techniques such as RNA seed\n\n35:34.280 --> 35:38.200\n allows us to see that these are the events\n\n35:38.200 --> 35:41.040\n that often happen in response.\n\n35:41.040 --> 35:44.560\n It's a dynamic event that happens in response\n\n35:44.560 --> 35:48.320\n to disease or in response\n\n35:48.320 --> 35:51.800\n to certain developmental stage of a cell.\n\n35:51.800 --> 35:56.800\n And this is an incredibly complex layer\n\n35:56.840 --> 35:59.800\n that also undergoes, I mean,\n\n35:59.800 --> 36:01.560\n because it's at the gene level, right?\n\n36:01.560 --> 36:05.440\n So it undergoes certain evolution, right?\n\n36:05.440 --> 36:08.680\n And now we have this interplay\n\n36:08.680 --> 36:12.720\n between what is happening in the protein world\n\n36:12.720 --> 36:17.720\n and what is happening in the gene and RNA world.\n\n36:17.720 --> 36:22.720\n And for example, it's often that we see\n\n36:22.720 --> 36:27.720\n that the boundaries of this exons coincide\n\n36:28.200 --> 36:32.160\n with the boundaries of the protein domains, right?\n\n36:32.160 --> 36:36.520\n So there is this close interplay to that.\n\n36:36.520 --> 36:39.280\n It's not always, I mean, otherwise it would be too simple,\n\n36:39.280 --> 36:40.120\n right?\n\n36:40.120 --> 36:41.880\n But we do see the connection\n\n36:41.880 --> 36:45.000\n between those sort of machineries.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:49.760\n And obviously the evolution will pick up this complexity\n\n36:49.760 --> 36:51.800\n and, you know.\n\n36:51.800 --> 36:53.480\n Select for whatever is successful,\n\n36:53.480 --> 36:55.040\n whatever is interesting function.\n\n36:55.040 --> 36:57.560\n We see that complexity in play\n\n36:57.560 --> 37:02.560\n and makes this question more complex, but more exciting.\n\n37:02.560 --> 37:05.440\n Small detour, I don't know if you think about this\n\n37:05.440 --> 37:07.540\n into the world of computer science.\n\n37:07.540 --> 37:11.240\n There's a Douglas Hostetter, I think,\n\n37:11.240 --> 37:14.360\n came up with the name of Quine,\n\n37:14.360 --> 37:16.180\n which are, I don't know if you're familiar\n\n37:16.180 --> 37:18.880\n with these things, but it's computer programs\n\n37:18.880 --> 37:22.160\n that have, I guess, exon and intron,\n\n37:22.160 --> 37:24.800\n and they copy, the whole purpose of the program\n\n37:24.800 --> 37:26.240\n is to copy itself.\n\n37:26.240 --> 37:28.480\n So it prints copies of itself,\n\n37:28.480 --> 37:30.980\n but can also carry information inside of it.\n\n37:30.980 --> 37:35.440\n So it's a very kind of crude, fun exercise of,\n\n37:36.420 --> 37:40.000\n can we sort of replicate these ideas from cells?\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:42.940\n Can we have a computer program that when you run it,\n\n37:42.940 --> 37:47.080\n just print itself, the entirety of itself,\n\n37:47.080 --> 37:50.040\n and does it in different programming languages and so on.\n\n37:50.040 --> 37:51.960\n I've been playing around and writing them.\n\n37:51.960 --> 37:53.720\n It's a kind of fun little exercise.\n\n37:53.720 --> 37:55.720\n You know, when I was a kid, so you know,\n\n37:55.720 --> 38:00.720\n it was essentially one of the sort of main stages\n\n38:02.860 --> 38:07.860\n in informatics Olympiads that you have to reach\n\n38:08.280 --> 38:10.880\n in order to be any so good,\n\n38:10.880 --> 38:14.400\n is you should be able to write a program\n\n38:14.400 --> 38:16.680\n that replicates itself.\n\n38:16.680 --> 38:20.920\n And so the task then becomes even sort of more complicated.\n\n38:20.920 --> 38:24.040\n So what is the shortest program?\n\n38:24.040 --> 38:27.480\n And of course, it's a function of a programming language,\n\n38:27.480 --> 38:30.940\n but yeah, I remember a long, long, long time ago\n\n38:30.940 --> 38:34.840\n when we tried to make it short and short\n\n38:34.840 --> 38:36.520\n and find the shortcut.\n\n38:36.520 --> 38:41.520\n There's actually on a stack exchange, there's a entire site\n\n38:41.720 --> 38:44.160\n called CodeGolf, I think,\n\n38:44.160 --> 38:46.560\n where the entirety is just the competition.\n\n38:46.560 --> 38:50.380\n People just come up with whatever task, I don't know,\n\n38:50.380 --> 38:54.680\n like write code that reports the weather today.\n\n38:54.680 --> 38:58.680\n And the competition is about whatever programming language,\n\n38:58.680 --> 39:00.440\n what is the shortest program?\n\n39:00.440 --> 39:02.280\n And it makes you actually, people should check it out\n\n39:02.280 --> 39:03.640\n because it makes you realize\n\n39:03.640 --> 39:07.160\n there's some weird programming languages out there.\n\n39:07.160 --> 39:11.740\n But just to dig on that a little deeper,\n\n39:12.640 --> 39:16.100\n do you think, in computer science,\n\n39:16.100 --> 39:19.280\n we don't often think about programs,\n\n39:19.280 --> 39:21.280\n just like the machine learning world now,\n\n39:22.280 --> 39:26.280\n that's still kind of basic programs.\n\n39:26.280 --> 39:29.600\n And then there's humans that replicate themselves, right?\n\n39:29.600 --> 39:31.440\n And there's these mutations and so on.\n\n39:31.440 --> 39:34.520\n Do you think we'll ever have a world\n\n39:34.520 --> 39:36.320\n where there's programs that kind of\n\n39:37.760 --> 39:40.640\n have an evolutionary process?\n\n39:40.640 --> 39:42.640\n So I'm not talking about evolutionary algorithms,\n\n39:42.640 --> 39:44.640\n but I'm talking about programs that kind of\n\n39:44.640 --> 39:46.480\n mate with each other and evolve\n\n39:46.480 --> 39:49.600\n and like on their own replicate themselves.\n\n39:49.600 --> 39:54.600\n So this is kind of the idea here is,\n\n39:54.640 --> 39:57.140\n that's how you can have a runaway thing.\n\n39:57.140 --> 39:59.240\n So we think about machine learning as a system\n\n39:59.240 --> 40:01.320\n that gets smarter and smarter and smarter and smarter.\n\n40:01.320 --> 40:05.240\n At least the machine learning systems of today are like,\n\n40:05.240 --> 40:09.000\n it's a program that you can like turn off,\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:12.680\n as opposed to throwing a bunch of little programs out there\n\n40:12.680 --> 40:15.560\n and letting them like multiply and mate\n\n40:15.560 --> 40:17.320\n and evolve and replicate.\n\n40:17.320 --> 40:20.400\n Do you ever think about that kind of world,\n\n40:20.400 --> 40:23.360\n when we jump from the biological systems\n\n40:23.360 --> 40:27.160\n that you're looking at to artificial ones?\n\n40:27.160 --> 40:32.160\n I mean, it's almost like you take the sort of the area\n\n40:32.440 --> 40:34.360\n of intelligent agents, right?\n\n40:34.360 --> 40:38.640\n Which are essentially the independent sort of codes\n\n40:38.640 --> 40:42.480\n that run and interact and exchange the information, right?\n\n40:42.480 --> 40:45.120\n So I don't see why not.\n\n40:45.120 --> 40:48.760\n I mean, it could be sort of a natural evolution\n\n40:48.760 --> 40:52.880\n in this area of computer science.\n\n40:52.880 --> 40:54.640\n I think it's kind of an interesting possibility.\n\n40:54.640 --> 40:55.880\n It's terrifying too,\n\n40:55.880 --> 40:58.360\n but I think it's a really powerful tool.\n\n40:58.360 --> 41:00.680\n Like to have like agents that, you know,\n\n41:00.680 --> 41:02.800\n we have social networks with millions of people\n\n41:02.800 --> 41:03.840\n and they interact.\n\n41:03.840 --> 41:05.720\n I think it's interesting to inject into that,\n\n41:05.720 --> 41:08.380\n was already injected into that bots, right?\n\n41:08.380 --> 41:10.040\n But those bots are pretty dumb.\n\n41:11.240 --> 41:14.720\n You know, they're probably pretty dumb algorithms.\n\n41:15.680 --> 41:17.480\n You know, it's interesting to think\n\n41:17.480 --> 41:20.440\n that there might be bots that evolve together with humans.\n\n41:20.440 --> 41:23.960\n And there's the sea of humans and robots\n\n41:23.960 --> 41:26.520\n that are operating first in the digital space.\n\n41:26.520 --> 41:29.080\n And then you can also think, I love the idea.\n\n41:29.080 --> 41:32.600\n Some people worked, I think at Harvard, at Penn,\n\n41:32.600 --> 41:36.680\n there's robotics labs that, you know,\n\n41:37.560 --> 41:40.600\n take as a fundamental task to build a robot\n\n41:40.600 --> 41:44.920\n that given extra resources can build another copy of itself,\n\n41:44.920 --> 41:46.560\n like in the physical space,\n\n41:46.560 --> 41:50.900\n which is super difficult to do, but super interesting.\n\n41:50.900 --> 41:54.020\n I remember there's like research on robots\n\n41:54.020 --> 41:55.240\n that can build a bridge.\n\n41:55.240 --> 41:56.880\n So they make a copy of themselves\n\n41:56.880 --> 41:57.960\n and they connect themselves\n\n41:57.960 --> 42:00.560\n and the sort of like self building bridge\n\n42:00.560 --> 42:02.380\n based on building blocks.\n\n42:02.380 --> 42:05.640\n You can imagine like a building that self assembles.\n\n42:05.640 --> 42:07.560\n So it's basically self assembling structures\n\n42:07.560 --> 42:10.620\n from robotic parts.\n\n42:10.620 --> 42:13.880\n But it's interesting to, within that robot,\n\n42:13.880 --> 42:15.920\n add the ability to mutate\n\n42:15.920 --> 42:20.920\n and do all the interesting like little things\n\n42:21.320 --> 42:23.200\n that you're referring to in evolution\n\n42:23.200 --> 42:26.320\n to go from a single origin protein building block\n\n42:26.320 --> 42:28.920\n to like this weird complex.\n\n42:28.920 --> 42:30.960\n And if you think about this, I mean, you know,\n\n42:30.960 --> 42:34.600\n the bits and pieces are there, you know.\n\n42:34.600 --> 42:37.040\n So you mentioned the evolution algorithm, right?\n\n42:37.040 --> 42:38.520\n You know, so this is sort of,\n\n42:38.520 --> 42:43.520\n and maybe sort of the goal is in a way different, right?\n\n42:43.520 --> 42:46.720\n So the goal is to, you know, to essentially,\n\n42:46.720 --> 42:50.080\n to optimize your search, right?\n\n42:50.080 --> 42:53.060\n So, but sort of the ideas are there.\n\n42:53.060 --> 42:55.080\n So people recognize that, you know,\n\n42:55.080 --> 43:00.080\n that the recombination events lead to global changes\n\n43:01.160 --> 43:04.440\n in the search trajectories, the mutations event\n\n43:04.440 --> 43:09.080\n is a more refined, you know, step in the search.\n\n43:09.080 --> 43:13.340\n Then you have, you know, other sort of\n\n43:14.220 --> 43:16.480\n nature inspired algorithm, right?\n\n43:16.480 --> 43:19.580\n So one of the reasons that, you know,\n\n43:19.580 --> 43:21.940\n I think it's one of the funnest one\n\n43:21.940 --> 43:24.820\n is the slime based algorithm, right?\n\n43:24.820 --> 43:28.220\n So it's, I think the first was introduced\n\n43:28.220 --> 43:30.220\n by the Japanese group,\n\n43:30.220 --> 43:35.220\n where it was able to solve some pre complex problems.\n\n43:35.220 --> 43:40.220\n So that's, and then I think there are still a lot of things\n\n43:43.340 --> 43:48.340\n we've yet to, you know, borrow from the nature, right?\n\n43:48.960 --> 43:52.020\n So there are a lot of sort of ideas\n\n43:52.020 --> 43:56.740\n that nature, you know, gets to offer us that, you know,\n\n43:56.740 --> 44:01.020\n it's up to us to grab it and to, you know,\n\n44:01.020 --> 44:02.140\n get the best use of it.\n\n44:02.140 --> 44:06.380\n Including neural networks, you know, we have a very crude\n\n44:06.380 --> 44:08.300\n inspiration from nature on neural networks.\n\n44:08.300 --> 44:10.920\n Maybe there's other inspirations to be discovered\n\n44:10.920 --> 44:15.920\n in the brain or other aspects of the various systems,\n\n44:16.280 --> 44:20.140\n even like the immune system, the way it interplays.\n\n44:20.140 --> 44:22.580\n I recently started to understand that the,\n\n44:22.580 --> 44:24.360\n like the immune system has something to do\n\n44:24.360 --> 44:26.020\n with the way the brain operates.\n\n44:26.020 --> 44:28.360\n Like there's multiple things going on in there,\n\n44:28.360 --> 44:30.500\n which all of which are not modeled\n\n44:30.500 --> 44:32.140\n in artificial neural networks.\n\n44:32.140 --> 44:35.380\n And maybe if you throw a little bit of that biological spice\n\n44:35.380 --> 44:39.020\n in there, you'll come up with something, something cool.\n\n44:39.020 --> 44:42.540\n I'm not sure if you're familiar with the Drake equation\n\n44:43.740 --> 44:46.740\n that estimate, I just did a video on it yesterday\n\n44:46.740 --> 44:49.280\n because I wanted to give my own estimate of it.\n\n44:49.280 --> 44:52.340\n It's an equation that combines a bunch of factors\n\n44:52.340 --> 44:56.980\n to estimate how many alien civilizations are in the galaxy.\n\n44:56.980 --> 44:58.500\n I've heard about it, yes.\n\n44:58.500 --> 45:01.340\n So one of the interesting parameters, you know,\n\n45:01.340 --> 45:05.980\n it's like how many stars are born every year,\n\n45:05.980 --> 45:10.980\n how many planets are on average per star for this,\n\n45:11.700 --> 45:14.260\n how many habitable planets are there.\n\n45:14.260 --> 45:17.580\n And then the one that starts being really interesting\n\n45:18.660 --> 45:23.660\n is the probability that life emerges on a habitable planet.\n\n45:24.740 --> 45:27.900\n So like, I don't know if you think about,\n\n45:27.900 --> 45:29.720\n you certainly think a lot about evolution,\n\n45:29.720 --> 45:31.060\n but do you think about the thing\n\n45:31.060 --> 45:32.520\n which evolution doesn't describe,\n\n45:32.520 --> 45:36.620\n which is like the beginning of evolution, the origin of life.\n\n45:36.620 --> 45:39.320\n I think I put the probability of life developing\n\n45:39.320 --> 45:41.800\n in a habitable planet at 1%.\n\n45:41.800 --> 45:44.440\n This is very scientifically rigorous.\n\n45:44.440 --> 45:48.740\n Okay, well, first at a high level for the Drake equation,\n\n45:48.740 --> 45:51.660\n what would you put that percent at on earth?\n\n45:51.660 --> 45:55.100\n And in general, do you have something,\n\n45:55.100 --> 45:58.220\n do you have thoughts about how life might've started,\n\n45:58.220 --> 46:01.100\n you know, like the proteins being the first kind of,\n\n46:01.100 --> 46:02.940\n one of the early jumping points?\n\n46:02.940 --> 46:07.500\n Yeah, so I think back in 2018,\n\n46:07.500 --> 46:10.460\n there was a very exciting paper published in Nature\n\n46:10.460 --> 46:15.460\n where they found one of the simplest amino acids,\n\n46:18.320 --> 46:23.320\n glycine, in a comet dust.\n\n46:23.320 --> 46:28.320\n So this is, and I apologize if I don't pronounce,\n\n46:29.440 --> 46:31.840\n it's a Russian named comet,\n\n46:31.840 --> 46:34.760\n it's I think Chugryumov Gerasimenko.\n\n46:34.760 --> 46:38.760\n This is the comet where, and there was this mission\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:45.000\n to get close to this comet and get the stardust\n\n46:46.320 --> 46:48.160\n from its tail.\n\n46:48.160 --> 46:50.620\n And when scientists analyzed it,\n\n46:50.620 --> 46:55.620\n they actually found traces of, you know, of glycine,\n\n46:56.640 --> 46:59.400\n which, you know, makes up, you know,\n\n46:59.400 --> 47:04.180\n it's one of the basic, one of the 20 basic amino acids\n\n47:04.180 --> 47:06.400\n that makes up proteins, right?\n\n47:06.400 --> 47:10.960\n So that was kind of very exciting, right?\n\n47:10.960 --> 47:14.220\n But, you know, the question is very interesting, right?\n\n47:14.220 --> 47:18.540\n So what, you know, if there is some alien life,\n\n47:18.540 --> 47:22.940\n is it gonna be made of proteins, right?\n\n47:22.940 --> 47:24.340\n Or maybe RNAs, right?\n\n47:24.340 --> 47:29.120\n So we see that, you know, the RNA viruses are certainly,\n\n47:29.120 --> 47:34.120\n you know, very well established sort of, you know,\n\n47:35.020 --> 47:37.820\n group of molecular machines, right?\n\n47:37.820 --> 47:42.140\n So, yeah, it's a very interesting question.\n\n47:42.140 --> 47:43.580\n What probability would you put?\n\n47:43.580 --> 47:45.260\n Like, how hard is this job?\n\n47:45.260 --> 47:48.740\n Like, how unlikely just on Earth do you think\n\n47:48.740 --> 47:51.600\n this whole thing is that we got going?\n\n47:51.600 --> 47:54.620\n Like, are we really lucky or is it inevitable?\n\n47:54.620 --> 47:56.240\n Like, what's your sense when you sit back\n\n47:56.240 --> 47:58.820\n and think about life on Earth?\n\n47:58.820 --> 48:00.980\n Is it higher or lower than 1%?\n\n48:00.980 --> 48:03.420\n Well, because 1% is pretty low, but it still is like,\n\n48:03.420 --> 48:05.060\n damn, that's a pretty good chance.\n\n48:05.060 --> 48:06.600\n Yes, it's a pretty good chance.\n\n48:06.600 --> 48:10.580\n I mean, I would, personally, but again, you know,\n\n48:10.580 --> 48:14.140\n I'm, you know, probably not the best person\n\n48:14.140 --> 48:19.140\n to do such estimations, but I would, you know,\n\n48:19.340 --> 48:23.100\n intuitively, I would probably put it lower.\n\n48:23.100 --> 48:24.820\n But still, I mean, you know, given.\n\n48:24.820 --> 48:26.620\n So we're really lucky here on Earth.\n\n48:27.980 --> 48:28.820\n I mean.\n\n48:28.820 --> 48:30.500\n Or the conditions are really good.\n\n48:30.500 --> 48:32.340\n It's, you know, I think that there was,\n\n48:32.340 --> 48:35.460\n everything was right in a way, right?\n\n48:35.460 --> 48:39.720\n So we still, it's not, the conditions were not like ideal\n\n48:39.720 --> 48:44.060\n if you try to look at, you know, what was, you know,\n\n48:44.060 --> 48:48.340\n several billions years ago when the life emerged.\n\n48:48.340 --> 48:52.020\n So there is something called the Rare Earth Hypothesis\n\n48:52.020 --> 48:55.740\n that, you know, in counter to the Drake Equation says\n\n48:55.740 --> 49:00.240\n that the, you know, the conditions of Earth,\n\n49:00.240 --> 49:03.260\n if you actually were to describe Earth,\n\n49:03.260 --> 49:05.700\n it's quite a special place.\n\n49:05.700 --> 49:09.120\n So special it might be unique in our galaxy\n\n49:09.120 --> 49:11.780\n and potentially, you know, close to unique\n\n49:11.780 --> 49:12.860\n in the entire universe.\n\n49:12.860 --> 49:14.740\n Like it's very difficult to reconstruct\n\n49:14.740 --> 49:16.380\n those same conditions.\n\n49:16.380 --> 49:19.580\n And what the Rare Earth Hypothesis argues\n\n49:19.580 --> 49:23.100\n is all those different conditions are essential for life.\n\n49:23.100 --> 49:26.180\n And so that's sort of the counter, you know,\n\n49:26.180 --> 49:29.220\n like all the things we, you know,\n\n49:29.220 --> 49:31.740\n thinking that Earth is pretty average.\n\n49:31.740 --> 49:34.340\n I mean, I can't really, I'm trying to remember\n\n49:34.340 --> 49:36.140\n to go through all of them, but just the fact\n\n49:36.140 --> 49:41.140\n that it is shielded from a lot of asteroids,\n\n49:41.140 --> 49:43.820\n the, obviously the distance to the sun,\n\n49:43.820 --> 49:48.220\n but also the fact that it's like a perfect balance\n\n49:48.220 --> 49:52.180\n between the amount of water and land\n\n49:52.180 --> 49:53.660\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n49:53.660 --> 49:55.180\n I don't know, there's a bunch of different factors\n\n49:55.180 --> 49:57.520\n that I don't remember, there's a long list.\n\n49:57.520 --> 50:01.260\n But it's fascinating to think about if in order\n\n50:01.260 --> 50:05.020\n for something like proteins and then DNA and RNA\n\n50:05.020 --> 50:10.020\n to emerge, you need, and basic living organisms,\n\n50:10.020 --> 50:14.960\n you need to be very close to an Earth like planet,\n\n50:14.960 --> 50:19.740\n which will be sad or exciting, I don't know which.\n\n50:19.740 --> 50:23.220\n If you ask me, I, you know, in a way I put a parallel\n\n50:23.220 --> 50:28.220\n between, you know, between our own research.\n\n50:28.380 --> 50:33.380\n And I mean, from the intuitive perspective,\n\n50:33.820 --> 50:36.700\n you know, you have those two extremes\n\n50:36.700 --> 50:40.820\n and the reality is never very rarely falls\n\n50:40.820 --> 50:41.900\n into the extremes.\n\n50:41.900 --> 50:46.500\n It's always the optimus always reached somewhere in between.\n\n50:46.500 --> 50:50.060\n So, and that's what I tend to think.\n\n50:50.060 --> 50:54.020\n I think that, you know, we're probably somewhere in between.\n\n50:54.020 --> 50:58.220\n So they were not unique, unique, but again,\n\n50:58.220 --> 51:01.940\n the chances are, you know, reasonably small.\n\n51:01.940 --> 51:04.180\n The problem is we don't know the other extreme\n\n51:04.180 --> 51:08.060\n is like, I tend to think that we don't actually understand\n\n51:08.060 --> 51:11.900\n the basic mechanisms of like what this is all originated\n\n51:11.900 --> 51:15.060\n from, like, it seems like we think of life\n\n51:15.060 --> 51:17.100\n as this distinct thing, maybe intelligence\n\n51:17.100 --> 51:20.380\n is a distinct thing, maybe the physics that,\n\n51:20.380 --> 51:24.380\n from which planets and suns are born is a distinct thing.\n\n51:24.380 --> 51:27.140\n But that could be a very, it's like the Stephen Wolfram\n\n51:27.140 --> 51:29.420\n thing, it's like the, from simple rules emerges\n\n51:29.420 --> 51:31.020\n greater and greater complexity.\n\n51:31.020 --> 51:34.940\n So, you know, I tend to believe that just life finds a way.\n\n51:36.100 --> 51:39.540\n Like, we don't know the extreme of how common life is\n\n51:39.540 --> 51:43.660\n because it could be life is like everywhere.\n\n51:44.980 --> 51:49.420\n Like, so everywhere that it's almost like laughable,\n\n51:49.420 --> 51:52.140\n like that we're such idiots to think who are you?\n\n51:52.140 --> 51:56.260\n Like, it's like ridiculous to even like think,\n\n51:56.260 --> 51:59.460\n it's like ants thinking that their little colony\n\n51:59.460 --> 52:03.220\n is the unique thing and everything else doesn't exist.\n\n52:03.220 --> 52:07.540\n I mean, it's also very possible that that's the extreme\n\n52:07.540 --> 52:09.900\n and we're just not able to maybe comprehend\n\n52:09.900 --> 52:12.860\n the nature of that life.\n\n52:12.860 --> 52:16.580\n Just to stick on alien life for just a brief moment more,\n\n52:16.580 --> 52:21.580\n there is some signs of life on Venus in gaseous form.\n\n52:22.260 --> 52:27.260\n There's hope for life on Mars, probably extinct.\n\n52:27.260 --> 52:29.220\n We're not talking about intelligent life.\n\n52:29.220 --> 52:32.340\n Although that has been in the news recently.\n\n52:32.340 --> 52:36.300\n We're talking about basic like, you know, bacteria.\n\n52:36.300 --> 52:40.820\n Yeah, and then also, I guess, there's a couple moons.\n\n52:40.820 --> 52:41.660\n Europe.\n\n52:41.660 --> 52:45.100\n Yeah, Europa, which is Jupiter's moon.\n\n52:45.100 --> 52:46.580\n I think there's another one.\n\n52:46.580 --> 52:50.380\n Are you, is that exciting or is it terrifying to you\n\n52:50.380 --> 52:52.140\n that we might find life?\n\n52:52.140 --> 52:53.580\n Do you hope we find life?\n\n52:53.580 --> 52:56.020\n I certainly do hope that we find life.\n\n52:56.020 --> 53:01.020\n I mean, it was very exciting to hear about this news\n\n53:05.380 --> 53:09.260\n about the possible life on Venus.\n\n53:09.260 --> 53:12.540\n It'd be nice to have hard evidence of something with,\n\n53:12.540 --> 53:17.140\n which is what the hope is for Mars and Europa.\n\n53:17.140 --> 53:18.420\n But do you think those organisms\n\n53:18.420 --> 53:20.780\n will be similar biologically\n\n53:20.780 --> 53:23.940\n or would they even be sort of carbon based\n\n53:23.940 --> 53:25.740\n if we do find them?\n\n53:25.740 --> 53:28.940\n I would say they would be carbon based.\n\n53:28.940 --> 53:31.820\n How similar, it's a big question, right?\n\n53:31.820 --> 53:36.820\n So it's the moment we discover things outside Earth, right?\n\n53:39.540 --> 53:43.260\n Even if it's a tiny little single cell.\n\n53:43.260 --> 53:45.380\n I mean, there is so much.\n\n53:45.380 --> 53:47.660\n Just imagine that, that would be so.\n\n53:47.660 --> 53:50.700\n I think that that would be another turning point\n\n53:50.700 --> 53:52.540\n for the science, you know?\n\n53:52.540 --> 53:56.220\n Especially if it's different in some very new way.\n\n53:56.220 --> 53:57.060\n That's exciting.\n\n53:57.060 --> 53:59.700\n Because that says, that's a definitive statement,\n\n53:59.700 --> 54:01.780\n not a definitive, but a pretty strong statement\n\n54:01.780 --> 54:05.420\n that life is everywhere in the universe.\n\n54:05.420 --> 54:07.700\n To me at least, that's really exciting.\n\n54:08.940 --> 54:13.460\n You brought up Joshua Lederberg in an offline conversation.\n\n54:13.460 --> 54:15.780\n I think I'd love to talk to you about Alpha Fold\n\n54:15.780 --> 54:17.220\n and this might be an interesting way\n\n54:17.220 --> 54:19.580\n to enter that conversation because,\n\n54:19.580 --> 54:24.500\n so he won the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine\n\n54:24.500 --> 54:29.020\n for discovering that bacteria can mate and exchange genes.\n\n54:29.020 --> 54:32.220\n But he also did a ton of other stuff,\n\n54:32.220 --> 54:37.220\n like we mentioned, helping NASA find life on Mars\n\n54:37.740 --> 54:40.980\n and the...\n\n54:40.980 --> 54:42.580\n Dendro. Dendro.\n\n54:42.580 --> 54:45.260\n The chemical expert system.\n\n54:45.260 --> 54:46.860\n Expert systems, remember those?\n\n54:46.860 --> 54:51.380\n What do you find interesting about this guy\n\n54:51.380 --> 54:54.980\n and his ideas about artificial intelligence in general?\n\n54:54.980 --> 54:59.980\n So I have a kind of personal story to share.\n\n55:00.180 --> 55:05.140\n So I started my PhD in Canada back in 2000.\n\n55:05.140 --> 55:07.740\n And so essentially my PhD was,\n\n55:07.740 --> 55:10.100\n so we were developing sort of a new language\n\n55:10.100 --> 55:12.540\n for symbolic machine learning.\n\n55:12.540 --> 55:15.100\n So it's different from the feature based machine learning.\n\n55:15.100 --> 55:19.820\n And one of the sort of cleanest applications\n\n55:19.820 --> 55:23.980\n of this approach, of this formalism\n\n55:23.980 --> 55:28.820\n was to cheminformatics and computer aided drug design.\n\n55:28.820 --> 55:32.700\n So essentially we were, as a part of my research,\n\n55:33.820 --> 55:37.380\n I developed a system that essentially looked\n\n55:37.380 --> 55:42.380\n at chemical compounds of say the same therapeutic category,\n\n55:42.380 --> 55:45.540\n you know, male hormones, right?\n\n55:45.540 --> 55:50.540\n And try to figure out the structural fragments\n\n55:51.740 --> 55:54.420\n that are the structural building blocks\n\n55:54.420 --> 55:58.140\n that are important that define this class\n\n55:58.140 --> 55:59.780\n versus structural building blocks\n\n55:59.780 --> 56:02.700\n that are there just because, you know,\n\n56:02.700 --> 56:04.260\n to complete the structure.\n\n56:04.260 --> 56:06.060\n But they are not essentially the ones\n\n56:06.060 --> 56:10.020\n that make up the chemical, the key chemical properties\n\n56:10.020 --> 56:12.780\n of this therapeutic category.\n\n56:12.780 --> 56:16.900\n And, you know, for me, it was something new.\n\n56:16.900 --> 56:20.580\n I was trained as an applied mathematicians, you know,\n\n56:20.580 --> 56:22.980\n as with some machine learning background,\n\n56:22.980 --> 56:25.060\n but, you know, computer aided drug design\n\n56:25.060 --> 56:27.660\n was a completely new territory.\n\n56:27.660 --> 56:31.500\n So because of that, I often find myself\n\n56:31.500 --> 56:34.340\n asking lots of questions on one of these\n\n56:34.340 --> 56:36.940\n sort of central forums.\n\n56:36.940 --> 56:40.420\n Back then, there were no Facebooks or stuff like that.\n\n56:40.420 --> 56:43.620\n There was a forum, you know, it's a forum.\n\n56:43.620 --> 56:45.780\n It's essentially, it's like a bulletin board.\n\n56:45.780 --> 56:46.620\n Yeah.\n\n56:46.620 --> 56:47.460\n On the internet.\n\n56:47.460 --> 56:50.300\n Yeah, so you essentially, you have a bunch of people\n\n56:50.300 --> 56:52.900\n and you post a question and you get, you know,\n\n56:52.900 --> 56:55.300\n an answer from, you know, different people.\n\n56:55.300 --> 56:59.300\n And back then, just like one of the most popular forums\n\n56:59.300 --> 57:04.300\n was CCL, I think Computational Chemistry Library,\n\n57:04.300 --> 57:07.100\n not library, but something like that,\n\n57:07.100 --> 57:09.820\n but CCL, that was the forum.\n\n57:09.820 --> 57:12.780\n And there, I, you know, I...\n\n57:12.780 --> 57:14.060\n Asked a lot of dumb questions.\n\n57:14.060 --> 57:15.500\n Yes, I asked questions.\n\n57:15.500 --> 57:19.340\n Also shared some, you know, some information\n\n57:19.340 --> 57:21.460\n about how formal it is and how we do\n\n57:21.460 --> 57:25.100\n and whether whatever we do makes sense.\n\n57:25.100 --> 57:29.180\n And so, you know, and I remember that one of these posts,\n\n57:29.180 --> 57:31.420\n I mean, I still remember, you know,\n\n57:31.420 --> 57:35.340\n I would call it desperately looking\n\n57:35.340 --> 57:40.340\n for a chemist advice, something like that, right?\n\n57:40.740 --> 57:43.980\n And so I post my question, I explained, you know,\n\n57:43.980 --> 57:48.980\n how formalism is, what it does\n\n57:49.220 --> 57:53.180\n and what kind of applications I'm planning to do.\n\n57:53.180 --> 57:55.020\n And, you know, and it was, you know,\n\n57:55.020 --> 57:59.660\n in the middle of the night and I went back to bed.\n\n57:59.660 --> 58:04.660\n And next morning, have a phone call from my advisor\n\n58:04.780 --> 58:06.900\n who also looked at this forum.\n\n58:06.900 --> 58:11.020\n It's like, you won't believe who replied to you.\n\n58:11.020 --> 58:13.900\n And it's like, who?\n\n58:13.900 --> 58:16.300\n And he said, well, you know, there is a message\n\n58:16.300 --> 58:17.900\n to you from Joshua Lederberg.\n\n58:19.140 --> 58:22.660\n And my reaction was like, who is Joshua Lederberg?\n\n58:22.660 --> 58:29.660\n Your advisor hung up. So, and essentially, you know,\n\n58:29.660 --> 58:34.060\n Joshua wrote me that we had conceptually similar ideas\n\n58:34.060 --> 58:36.660\n in the dendrial project.\n\n58:36.660 --> 58:38.220\n You may wanna look it up.\n\n58:39.300 --> 58:42.620\n And we should also, sorry, and it's a side comment,\n\n58:42.620 --> 58:45.940\n say that even though he won the Nobel Prize\n\n58:45.940 --> 58:49.820\n at a really young age, in 58, but so he was,\n\n58:49.820 --> 58:52.860\n I think he was what, 33.\n\n58:52.860 --> 58:53.980\n It's just crazy.\n\n58:53.980 --> 58:57.660\n So anyway, so that's, so hence in the 90s,\n\n58:57.660 --> 59:02.100\n responding to young whippersnappers on the CCL forum.\n\n59:02.100 --> 59:02.940\n Okay.\n\n59:02.940 --> 59:05.820\n And so back then he was already very senior.\n\n59:05.820 --> 59:09.580\n I mean, he unfortunately passed away back in 2008,\n\n59:09.580 --> 59:12.580\n but, you know, back in 2001, he was, I mean,\n\n59:12.580 --> 59:15.980\n he was a professor emeritus at Rockefeller University.\n\n59:15.980 --> 59:18.460\n And, you know, that was actually, believe it or not,\n\n59:18.460 --> 59:23.460\n one of the reasons I decided to join, you know,\n\n59:25.460 --> 59:28.140\n as a postdoc, the group of Andre Salle,\n\n59:28.140 --> 59:30.820\n who was at Rockefeller University,\n\n59:30.820 --> 59:33.460\n with the hope that, you know, that I could actually,\n\n59:33.460 --> 59:38.060\n you know, have a chance to meet Joshua in person.\n\n59:38.060 --> 59:40.860\n And I met him very briefly, right?\n\n59:42.140 --> 59:45.380\n Just because he was walking, you know,\n\n59:45.380 --> 59:47.860\n there's a little bridge that connects the,\n\n59:47.860 --> 59:50.860\n sort of the research campus with the,\n\n59:51.940 --> 59:55.500\n with the sort of skyscraper that Rockefeller owns,\n\n59:55.500 --> 59:58.780\n the where, you know, postdocs and faculty\n\n59:58.780 --> 1:00:00.260\n and graduate students live.\n\n1:00:00.260 --> 1:00:02.460\n And so I met him, you know,\n\n1:00:02.460 --> 1:00:06.340\n and had a very short conversation, you know.\n\n1:00:06.340 --> 1:00:10.380\n But so I started, you know, reading about Dendral\n\n1:00:10.380 --> 1:00:12.660\n and I was amazed, you know, it's,\n\n1:00:12.660 --> 1:00:16.100\n we're talking about 1960, right?\n\n1:00:16.100 --> 1:00:19.300\n The ideas were so profound.\n\n1:00:19.300 --> 1:00:21.140\n Well, what's the fun about the ideas of it?\n\n1:00:21.140 --> 1:00:25.020\n The reason to make this is even crazier.\n\n1:00:25.020 --> 1:00:29.860\n So, Lederberg wanted to make a system\n\n1:00:29.860 --> 1:00:34.860\n that would help him study the extraterrestrial molecules,\n\n1:00:38.220 --> 1:00:39.060\n right?\n\n1:00:39.060 --> 1:00:40.980\n So, the idea was that, you know,\n\n1:00:40.980 --> 1:00:43.420\n the way you study the extraterrestrial molecules\n\n1:00:43.420 --> 1:00:46.780\n is you do the mass spec analysis, right?\n\n1:00:46.780 --> 1:00:49.700\n And so the mass spec gives you sort of bits,\n\n1:00:49.700 --> 1:00:52.620\n numbers about essentially gives you the ideas\n\n1:00:52.620 --> 1:00:55.900\n about the possible fragments or, you know,\n\n1:00:55.900 --> 1:00:59.820\n atoms, you know, and maybe a little fragments,\n\n1:00:59.820 --> 1:01:03.620\n pieces of this molecule that make up the molecule, right?\n\n1:01:03.620 --> 1:01:06.060\n So now you need to sort of,\n\n1:01:06.060 --> 1:01:09.180\n to decompose this information\n\n1:01:09.180 --> 1:01:12.460\n and to figure out what was the hole\n\n1:01:12.460 --> 1:01:17.460\n before it became fragments, bits and pieces, right?\n\n1:01:17.660 --> 1:01:20.860\n So, in order to make this, you know,\n\n1:01:20.860 --> 1:01:25.660\n to have this tool, the idea of Lederberg\n\n1:01:25.660 --> 1:01:30.660\n was to connect chemistry, computer science,\n\n1:01:32.060 --> 1:01:36.100\n and to design this so called expert system\n\n1:01:36.100 --> 1:01:38.180\n that looks, that takes into account,\n\n1:01:38.180 --> 1:01:42.180\n that takes as an input the mass spec data,\n\n1:01:42.180 --> 1:01:47.180\n the possible database of possible molecules\n\n1:01:47.980 --> 1:01:52.660\n and essentially try to sort of induce the molecule\n\n1:01:52.660 --> 1:01:55.580\n that would correspond to this spectra\n\n1:01:55.580 --> 1:02:00.580\n or, you know, essentially what this project ended up being\n\n1:02:03.060 --> 1:02:07.100\n was that, you know, it would provide a list of candidates\n\n1:02:07.100 --> 1:02:11.940\n that then a chemist would look at and make final decision.\n\n1:02:11.940 --> 1:02:12.780\n So.\n\n1:02:12.780 --> 1:02:13.980\n But the original idea, I suppose,\n\n1:02:13.980 --> 1:02:16.820\n is to solve the entirety of this problem automatically.\n\n1:02:16.820 --> 1:02:17.660\n Yes, yes.\n\n1:02:17.660 --> 1:02:21.940\n So he, you know, so he,\n\n1:02:21.940 --> 1:02:25.180\n back then he approached. 60s.\n\n1:02:25.180 --> 1:02:28.940\n Yes, believe that, it's amazing.\n\n1:02:28.940 --> 1:02:32.220\n I mean, it still blows my mind, you know, that it's,\n\n1:02:32.220 --> 1:02:37.220\n that's, and this was essentially the origin\n\n1:02:37.420 --> 1:02:41.100\n of the modern bioinformatics, cheminformatics,\n\n1:02:41.100 --> 1:02:42.780\n you know, back in 60s.\n\n1:02:42.780 --> 1:02:47.780\n So that's, you know, every time you deal with projects\n\n1:02:48.540 --> 1:02:51.340\n like this, with the, you know, research like this,\n\n1:02:51.340 --> 1:02:56.340\n you just, you know, so the power of the, you know,\n\n1:02:56.340 --> 1:03:01.340\n intelligence of this people is just, you know, overwhelming.\n\n1:03:01.740 --> 1:03:05.420\n Do you think about expert systems, is there,\n\n1:03:05.420 --> 1:03:10.380\n and why they kind of didn't become successful,\n\n1:03:10.380 --> 1:03:12.500\n especially in the space of bioinformatics,\n\n1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:15.380\n where it does seem like there is a lot of expertise\n\n1:03:15.380 --> 1:03:20.060\n in humans, and, you know, it's possible to see\n\n1:03:20.060 --> 1:03:23.580\n that a system like this could be made very useful.\n\n1:03:23.580 --> 1:03:24.420\n Right.\n\n1:03:24.420 --> 1:03:25.260\n And be built up.\n\n1:03:25.260 --> 1:03:26.900\n So it's actually, it's a great question,\n\n1:03:26.900 --> 1:03:30.460\n and this is something, so, you know, so, you know,\n\n1:03:30.460 --> 1:03:33.900\n at my university, I teach artificial intelligence,\n\n1:03:33.900 --> 1:03:37.940\n and, you know, we start, my first two lectures\n\n1:03:37.940 --> 1:03:40.140\n are on the history of AI.\n\n1:03:40.140 --> 1:03:44.380\n And there we, you know, we try to, you know,\n\n1:03:45.300 --> 1:03:48.180\n go through the main stages of AI.\n\n1:03:48.180 --> 1:03:53.180\n And so, you know, the question of why expert systems failed\n\n1:03:54.260 --> 1:03:58.540\n or became obsolete, it's actually a very interesting one.\n\n1:03:58.540 --> 1:04:01.980\n And there are, you know, if you try to read the, you know,\n\n1:04:01.980 --> 1:04:03.340\n the historical perspectives,\n\n1:04:03.340 --> 1:04:05.540\n there are actually two lines of thoughts.\n\n1:04:05.540 --> 1:04:10.540\n One is that they were essentially\n\n1:04:11.940 --> 1:04:14.820\n not up to the expectations.\n\n1:04:14.820 --> 1:04:18.020\n And so therefore they were replaced, you know,\n\n1:04:18.020 --> 1:04:21.180\n by other things, right?\n\n1:04:21.180 --> 1:04:25.340\n The other one was that completely opposite one,\n\n1:04:25.340 --> 1:04:28.140\n that they were too good.\n\n1:04:28.140 --> 1:04:31.900\n And as a result, they essentially became\n\n1:04:31.900 --> 1:04:33.180\n sort of a household name,\n\n1:04:33.180 --> 1:04:37.100\n and then essentially they got transformed.\n\n1:04:37.100 --> 1:04:40.700\n I mean, in both cases, sort of the outcome was the same.\n\n1:04:40.700 --> 1:04:43.740\n They evolved into something, right?\n\n1:04:43.740 --> 1:04:47.700\n And that's what I, you know, if I look at this, right?\n\n1:04:47.700 --> 1:04:50.180\n So the modern machine learning, right?\n\n1:04:50.180 --> 1:04:51.020\n So.\n\n1:04:51.020 --> 1:04:53.260\n So there's echoes in the modern machine learning.\n\n1:04:53.260 --> 1:04:55.340\n I think so, I think so, because, you know,\n\n1:04:55.340 --> 1:04:59.140\n if you think about this, you know, and how we design,\n\n1:04:59.140 --> 1:05:02.500\n you know, the most successful algorithms,\n\n1:05:02.500 --> 1:05:04.140\n including AlphaFold, right?\n\n1:05:04.140 --> 1:05:08.100\n You built in the knowledge about the domain\n\n1:05:08.100 --> 1:05:09.940\n that you study, right?\n\n1:05:09.940 --> 1:05:12.900\n So you built in your expertise.\n\n1:05:12.900 --> 1:05:14.460\n So speaking of AlphaFold,\n\n1:05:14.460 --> 1:05:18.260\n so DeepMind's AlphaFold 2 recently was announced\n\n1:05:18.260 --> 1:05:21.980\n to have, quote unquote, solved protein folding.\n\n1:05:21.980 --> 1:05:24.220\n But how exciting is this to you?\n\n1:05:24.220 --> 1:05:27.060\n It seems to be one of the,\n\n1:05:27.060 --> 1:05:29.660\n one of the exciting things that have happened in 2020.\n\n1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:32.340\n It's an incredible accomplishment from the looks of it.\n\n1:05:32.340 --> 1:05:33.860\n What part of it is amazing to you?\n\n1:05:33.860 --> 1:05:36.300\n What part would you say is over hype\n\n1:05:36.300 --> 1:05:39.020\n or maybe misunderstood?\n\n1:05:39.020 --> 1:05:41.940\n It's definitely a very exciting achievement.\n\n1:05:41.940 --> 1:05:43.820\n To give you a little bit of perspective, right?\n\n1:05:43.820 --> 1:05:48.820\n So in bioinformatics, we have several competitions.\n\n1:05:50.020 --> 1:05:53.060\n And so the way, you know, you often hear\n\n1:05:53.940 --> 1:05:56.220\n how those competitions have been explained\n\n1:05:56.220 --> 1:05:59.820\n to sort of to non bioinformaticians is that, you know,\n\n1:05:59.820 --> 1:06:01.900\n they call it bioinformatics Olympic games.\n\n1:06:01.900 --> 1:06:03.620\n And there are several disciplines, right?\n\n1:06:03.620 --> 1:06:07.020\n So the historically one of the first one\n\n1:06:07.020 --> 1:06:10.300\n was the discipline in predicting the protein structure,\n\n1:06:10.300 --> 1:06:12.580\n predicting the 3D coordinates of the protein.\n\n1:06:12.580 --> 1:06:13.580\n But there are some others.\n\n1:06:13.580 --> 1:06:16.740\n So the predicting protein functions,\n\n1:06:16.740 --> 1:06:21.460\n predicting effects of mutations on protein functions,\n\n1:06:21.460 --> 1:06:24.900\n then predicting protein, protein interactions.\n\n1:06:24.900 --> 1:06:28.100\n So the original one was CASP\n\n1:06:28.100 --> 1:06:32.020\n or a critical assessment of a protein structure.\n\n1:06:32.020 --> 1:06:37.020\n And the, you know, typically what happens\n\n1:06:40.020 --> 1:06:43.980\n during this competitions is, you know, scientists,\n\n1:06:43.980 --> 1:06:48.380\n experimental scientists solve the structures,\n\n1:06:48.380 --> 1:06:51.700\n but don't put them into the protein data bank,\n\n1:06:51.700 --> 1:06:53.740\n which is the centralized database\n\n1:06:54.700 --> 1:06:57.260\n that contains all the 3D coordinates.\n\n1:06:57.260 --> 1:07:02.260\n Instead, they hold it and release protein sequences.\n\n1:07:02.340 --> 1:07:05.420\n And now the challenge of the community\n\n1:07:05.420 --> 1:07:10.180\n is to predict the 3D structures of this proteins\n\n1:07:10.180 --> 1:07:12.940\n and then use the experimental results structures\n\n1:07:12.940 --> 1:07:16.620\n to assess which one is the closest one, right?\n\n1:07:16.620 --> 1:07:17.740\n And this competition, by the way,\n\n1:07:17.740 --> 1:07:19.540\n just a bunch of different tangents.\n\n1:07:19.540 --> 1:07:22.860\n And maybe you can also say, what is protein folding?\n\n1:07:22.860 --> 1:07:25.020\n Then this competition, CASP competition\n\n1:07:25.020 --> 1:07:27.420\n has become the gold standard.\n\n1:07:27.420 --> 1:07:29.500\n And that's what was used to say\n\n1:07:29.500 --> 1:07:32.420\n that protein folding was solved.\n\n1:07:32.420 --> 1:07:35.300\n So just to add a little, just a bunch.\n\n1:07:35.300 --> 1:07:37.700\n So if you could, whenever you say stuff,\n\n1:07:37.700 --> 1:07:39.380\n maybe throw in some of the basics\n\n1:07:39.380 --> 1:07:41.580\n for the folks that might be outside of the field.\n\n1:07:41.580 --> 1:07:42.740\n Anyway, sorry.\n\n1:07:42.740 --> 1:07:45.900\n So, yeah, so, you know, so the reason it's, you know,\n\n1:07:45.900 --> 1:07:50.260\n it's relevant to our understanding of protein folding\n\n1:07:50.260 --> 1:07:54.180\n is because, you know, we've yet to learn\n\n1:07:54.180 --> 1:07:58.140\n how the folding mechanistically works, right?\n\n1:07:58.140 --> 1:08:00.740\n So there are different hypothesis,\n\n1:08:00.740 --> 1:08:02.780\n what happens to this fold?\n\n1:08:02.780 --> 1:08:07.620\n For example, there is a hypothesis that the folding happens\n\n1:08:07.620 --> 1:08:12.620\n by, you know, also in the modular fashion, right?\n\n1:08:12.660 --> 1:08:16.220\n So that, you know, we have protein domains\n\n1:08:16.220 --> 1:08:17.940\n that get folded independently\n\n1:08:17.940 --> 1:08:19.700\n because their structure is stable.\n\n1:08:19.700 --> 1:08:23.380\n And then the whole protein structure gets formed.\n\n1:08:23.380 --> 1:08:25.380\n But, you know, within those domains,\n\n1:08:25.380 --> 1:08:27.460\n we also have a so called secondary structure,\n\n1:08:27.460 --> 1:08:29.820\n the small alpha helices, beta schists.\n\n1:08:29.820 --> 1:08:34.340\n So these are, you know, elements that are structurally stable.\n\n1:08:34.340 --> 1:08:37.820\n And so, and the question is, you know,\n\n1:08:37.820 --> 1:08:40.340\n when do they get formed?\n\n1:08:40.340 --> 1:08:42.580\n Because some of the secondary structure elements,\n\n1:08:42.580 --> 1:08:46.500\n you have to have, you know, a fragment in the beginning\n\n1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:49.420\n and say the fragment in the middle, right?\n\n1:08:49.420 --> 1:08:54.420\n So you cannot potentially start having the full fold\n\n1:08:54.780 --> 1:08:57.100\n from the get go, right?\n\n1:08:57.100 --> 1:09:00.340\n So it's still, you know, it's still a big enigma,\n\n1:09:00.340 --> 1:09:01.420\n what happens.\n\n1:09:01.420 --> 1:09:04.260\n We know that it's an extremely efficient\n\n1:09:04.260 --> 1:09:05.660\n and stable process, right?\n\n1:09:05.660 --> 1:09:07.660\n So there's this long sequence\n\n1:09:07.660 --> 1:09:09.500\n and the fold happens really quickly.\n\n1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:10.340\n Exactly.\n\n1:09:10.340 --> 1:09:11.180\n So that's really weird, right?\n\n1:09:11.180 --> 1:09:15.340\n And it happens like the same way almost every time.\n\n1:09:15.340 --> 1:09:16.380\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n1:09:16.380 --> 1:09:17.860\n That's really weird.\n\n1:09:17.860 --> 1:09:19.060\n That's freaking weird.\n\n1:09:19.060 --> 1:09:22.900\n It's, yeah, that's why it's such an amazing thing.\n\n1:09:22.900 --> 1:09:24.300\n But most importantly, right?\n\n1:09:24.300 --> 1:09:27.460\n So it's, you know, so when you see the, you know,\n\n1:09:27.460 --> 1:09:29.260\n the translation process, right?\n\n1:09:29.260 --> 1:09:34.260\n So when you don't have the whole protein translated,\n\n1:09:36.100 --> 1:09:37.860\n right, it's still being translated,\n\n1:09:37.860 --> 1:09:41.180\n you know, getting out from the ribosome,\n\n1:09:41.180 --> 1:09:45.780\n you already see some structural, you know, fragmentation.\n\n1:09:45.780 --> 1:09:49.300\n So folding starts happening\n\n1:09:49.300 --> 1:09:52.780\n before the whole protein gets produced, right?\n\n1:09:52.780 --> 1:09:55.060\n And so this is obviously, you know,\n\n1:09:55.060 --> 1:09:59.220\n one of the biggest questions in, you know,\n\n1:09:59.220 --> 1:10:00.980\n in modern molecular biologists.\n\n1:10:00.980 --> 1:10:04.180\n Not like maybe what happens,\n\n1:10:04.180 --> 1:10:07.860\n like that's not as bigger than the question of folding.\n\n1:10:07.860 --> 1:10:09.540\n That's the question of like,\n\n1:10:09.540 --> 1:10:12.460\n something like deeper fundamental idea of folding.\n\n1:10:12.460 --> 1:10:13.380\n Yes. Behind folding.\n\n1:10:13.380 --> 1:10:14.620\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n1:10:14.620 --> 1:10:19.620\n So, you know, so obviously if we are able to predict\n\n1:10:21.340 --> 1:10:24.060\n the end product of protein folding,\n\n1:10:24.060 --> 1:10:27.660\n we are one step closer to understanding\n\n1:10:27.660 --> 1:10:30.220\n sort of the mechanisms of the protein folding.\n\n1:10:30.220 --> 1:10:34.700\n Because we can then potentially look and start probing\n\n1:10:34.700 --> 1:10:38.260\n what are the critical parts of this process\n\n1:10:38.260 --> 1:10:41.260\n and what are not so critical parts of this process.\n\n1:10:41.260 --> 1:10:44.420\n So we can start decomposing this, you know,\n\n1:10:44.420 --> 1:10:49.420\n so in a way this protein structure prediction algorithm\n\n1:10:50.100 --> 1:10:53.700\n can be used as a tool, right?\n\n1:10:53.700 --> 1:10:58.700\n So you change the, you know, you modify the protein,\n\n1:10:59.220 --> 1:11:02.380\n you get back to this tool, it predicts,\n\n1:11:02.380 --> 1:11:04.940\n okay, it's completely unstable.\n\n1:11:04.940 --> 1:11:07.820\n Yeah, which aspects of the input\n\n1:11:07.820 --> 1:11:09.860\n will have a big impact on the output?\n\n1:11:09.860 --> 1:11:11.140\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n1:11:11.140 --> 1:11:13.340\n So what happens is, you know,\n\n1:11:13.340 --> 1:11:18.340\n we typically have some sort of incremental advancement,\n\n1:11:18.700 --> 1:11:22.580\n you know, each stage of this CASP competition,\n\n1:11:22.580 --> 1:11:25.340\n you have groups with incremental advancement\n\n1:11:25.340 --> 1:11:29.860\n and, you know, historically the top performing groups\n\n1:11:29.860 --> 1:11:34.420\n were, you know, they were not using machine learning.\n\n1:11:34.420 --> 1:11:37.700\n They were using a very advanced biophysics\n\n1:11:37.700 --> 1:11:39.620\n combined with bioinformatics,\n\n1:11:39.620 --> 1:11:43.220\n combined with, you know, the data mining\n\n1:11:43.220 --> 1:11:47.380\n and that was, you know, that would enable them\n\n1:11:47.380 --> 1:11:52.380\n to obtain protein structures of those proteins\n\n1:11:52.660 --> 1:11:57.540\n that don't have any structurally solved relatives\n\n1:11:57.540 --> 1:12:01.860\n because, you know, if we have another protein,\n\n1:12:01.860 --> 1:12:05.640\n say the same protein, but coming from a different species,\n\n1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:10.460\n we could potentially derive some ideas\n\n1:12:10.460 --> 1:12:13.220\n and that's so called homology or comparative modeling,\n\n1:12:13.220 --> 1:12:15.300\n where we'll derive some ideas\n\n1:12:15.300 --> 1:12:17.540\n from the previously known structures\n\n1:12:17.540 --> 1:12:19.860\n and that would help us tremendously\n\n1:12:19.860 --> 1:12:24.860\n in, you know, in reconstructing the 3D structure overall.\n\n1:12:25.380 --> 1:12:27.900\n But what happens when we don't have these relatives?\n\n1:12:27.900 --> 1:12:31.220\n This is when it becomes really, really hard, right?\n\n1:12:31.220 --> 1:12:35.260\n So that's so called de novo, you know,\n\n1:12:35.260 --> 1:12:37.500\n de novo protein structure prediction.\n\n1:12:37.500 --> 1:12:42.500\n And in this case, those methods were traditionally very good.\n\n1:12:43.060 --> 1:12:46.300\n But what happened in the last year,\n\n1:12:46.300 --> 1:12:49.460\n the original alpha fold came into\n\n1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:55.640\n and all of a sudden it's much better than everyone else.\n\n1:12:56.420 --> 1:12:57.900\n This is 2018.\n\n1:12:57.900 --> 1:12:58.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:58.740 --> 1:13:02.140\n Oh, and the competition is only every two years, I think.\n\n1:13:02.140 --> 1:13:07.140\n And then, so, you know, it was sort of kind of over shockwave\n\n1:13:08.060 --> 1:13:10.740\n to the bioinformatics community that, you know,\n\n1:13:10.740 --> 1:13:15.440\n we have like a state of the art machine learning system\n\n1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:18.460\n that does, you know, structure prediction.\n\n1:13:18.460 --> 1:13:20.780\n And essentially what it does, you know,\n\n1:13:20.780 --> 1:13:25.780\n so if you look at this, it actually predicts the context.\n\n1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:29.460\n So, you know, so the process of reconstructing\n\n1:13:29.460 --> 1:13:34.460\n the 3D structure starts by predicting the context\n\n1:13:34.700 --> 1:13:38.860\n between the different parts of the protein.\n\n1:13:38.860 --> 1:13:40.980\n And the context essentially is the parts of the proteins\n\n1:13:40.980 --> 1:13:43.240\n that are in a close proximity to each other.\n\n1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:45.820\n Right, so actually the machine learning part\n\n1:13:45.820 --> 1:13:50.820\n seems to be estimating, you can correct me if I'm wrong here,\n\n1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:53.180\n but it seems to be estimating the distance matrix,\n\n1:13:53.180 --> 1:13:55.900\n which is like the distance between the different parts.\n\n1:13:55.900 --> 1:13:58.080\n Yeah, so we call the contact map.\n\n1:13:58.080 --> 1:13:58.920\n Contact map.\n\n1:13:58.920 --> 1:14:00.580\n So once you have the contact map,\n\n1:14:00.580 --> 1:14:04.860\n the reconstruction is becoming more straightforward, right?\n\n1:14:04.860 --> 1:14:06.780\n But so the contact map is the key.\n\n1:14:06.780 --> 1:14:11.260\n And so, you know, so that what happened.\n\n1:14:11.260 --> 1:14:15.980\n And now we started seeing in this current stage, right?\n\n1:14:15.980 --> 1:14:18.500\n Well, in the most recent one,\n\n1:14:18.500 --> 1:14:22.020\n we started seeing the emergence of these ideas\n\n1:14:22.020 --> 1:14:25.080\n in other people works, right?\n\n1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:29.500\n But yet here's, you know, AlphaFold2\n\n1:14:29.500 --> 1:14:33.380\n that again outperforms everyone else.\n\n1:14:33.380 --> 1:14:35.780\n And also by introducing yet another wave\n\n1:14:35.780 --> 1:14:38.620\n of the machine learning ideas.\n\n1:14:38.620 --> 1:14:41.260\n Yeah, there don't seem to be also an incorporation.\n\n1:14:41.260 --> 1:14:43.040\n First of all, the paper is not out yet,\n\n1:14:43.040 --> 1:14:44.860\n but there's a bunch of ideas already out.\n\n1:14:44.860 --> 1:14:48.100\n There does seem to be an incorporation of this other thing.\n\n1:14:48.100 --> 1:14:50.160\n I don't know if it's something that you could speak to,\n\n1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:55.160\n which is like the incorporation of like other structures,\n\n1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:01.720\n like evolutionary similar structures\n\n1:15:01.720 --> 1:15:03.820\n that are used to kind of give you hints.\n\n1:15:03.820 --> 1:15:08.360\n Yes, so evolutionary similarity is something\n\n1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:10.740\n that we can detect at different levels, right?\n\n1:15:10.740 --> 1:15:12.860\n So we know, for example,\n\n1:15:12.860 --> 1:15:17.140\n that the structure of proteins\n\n1:15:17.140 --> 1:15:20.520\n is more conserved than the sequence.\n\n1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:22.340\n The sequence could be very different,\n\n1:15:22.340 --> 1:15:26.300\n but the structural shape is actually still very conserved.\n\n1:15:26.300 --> 1:15:28.880\n So that's sort of the intrinsic property that, you know,\n\n1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:31.140\n in a way related to protein folds,\n\n1:15:31.140 --> 1:15:34.140\n you know, to the evolution of the, you know,\n\n1:15:34.140 --> 1:15:37.820\n of the proteins and protein domains, et cetera.\n\n1:15:37.820 --> 1:15:41.060\n But we know that, I mean, there've been multiple studies.\n\n1:15:41.060 --> 1:15:45.340\n And, you know, ideally, if you have structures,\n\n1:15:45.340 --> 1:15:48.580\n you know, you should use that information.\n\n1:15:48.580 --> 1:15:51.220\n However, sometimes we don't have this information.\n\n1:15:51.220 --> 1:15:53.220\n Instead, we have a bunch of sequences.\n\n1:15:53.220 --> 1:15:54.860\n Sequences, we have a lot, right?\n\n1:15:54.860 --> 1:15:59.860\n So we have, you know, hundreds, thousands\n\n1:16:00.340 --> 1:16:04.300\n of, you know, different organisms sequenced, right?\n\n1:16:04.300 --> 1:16:06.980\n And by taking the same protein,\n\n1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:11.620\n but in different organisms and aligning it,\n\n1:16:11.620 --> 1:16:15.980\n so making it, you know, making the corresponding positions\n\n1:16:15.980 --> 1:16:20.500\n aligned, we can actually say a lot\n\n1:16:20.500 --> 1:16:24.220\n about sort of what is conserved in this protein\n\n1:16:24.220 --> 1:16:26.920\n and therefore, you know, structurally more stable,\n\n1:16:26.920 --> 1:16:28.920\n what is diverse in this protein.\n\n1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:32.380\n So on top of that, we could provide sort of the information\n\n1:16:32.380 --> 1:16:35.100\n about the sort of the secondary structure\n\n1:16:35.100 --> 1:16:36.420\n of this protein, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:16:36.420 --> 1:16:38.980\n So this information is extremely useful\n\n1:16:39.940 --> 1:16:41.300\n and it's already there.\n\n1:16:41.300 --> 1:16:44.140\n So while it's tempting to, you know,\n\n1:16:44.140 --> 1:16:46.060\n to do a complete ab initio,\n\n1:16:46.060 --> 1:16:49.540\n so you just have a protein sequence and nothing else,\n\n1:16:49.540 --> 1:16:54.220\n the reality is such that we are overwhelmed with this data.\n\n1:16:54.220 --> 1:16:55.520\n So why not use it?\n\n1:16:56.500 --> 1:16:59.220\n And so, yeah, so I'm looking forward\n\n1:16:59.220 --> 1:17:01.500\n to reading this paper.\n\n1:17:01.500 --> 1:17:03.420\n It does seem to, like they've,\n\n1:17:03.420 --> 1:17:05.100\n in the previous version of Alpha Fold,\n\n1:17:05.100 --> 1:17:09.780\n they didn't, for this evolutionary similarity thing,\n\n1:17:09.780 --> 1:17:12.040\n they didn't use machine learning for that.\n\n1:17:12.960 --> 1:17:15.600\n Or rather, they used it as like the input\n\n1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:17.880\n to the entirety of the neural net,\n\n1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:22.020\n like the features derived from the similarity.\n\n1:17:22.020 --> 1:17:24.660\n It seems like there's some kind of quote, unquote,\n\n1:17:24.660 --> 1:17:29.660\n iterative thing where it seems to be part of the learning\n\n1:17:30.500 --> 1:17:34.260\n process is the incorporation of this evolutionary similarity.\n\n1:17:34.260 --> 1:17:36.940\n Yeah, I don't think there is a bioarchive paper, right?\n\n1:17:36.940 --> 1:17:37.780\n There's nothing.\n\n1:17:37.780 --> 1:17:38.620\n No, there's nothing.\n\n1:17:38.620 --> 1:17:40.680\n There's a blog post that's written\n\n1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:42.600\n by a marketing team, essentially,\n\n1:17:42.600 --> 1:17:46.600\n which, you know, it has some scientific similarity,\n\n1:17:48.420 --> 1:17:51.780\n probably, to the actual methodology used,\n\n1:17:51.780 --> 1:17:55.220\n but it could be, it's like interpreting scripture.\n\n1:17:55.220 --> 1:17:59.660\n It could be just poetic interpretations of the actual work\n\n1:17:59.660 --> 1:18:01.900\n as opposed to direct connection to the work.\n\n1:18:01.900 --> 1:18:04.260\n So now, speaking about protein folding, right?\n\n1:18:04.260 --> 1:18:06.820\n So, you know, in order to answer the question\n\n1:18:06.820 --> 1:18:09.460\n whether or not we have solved this, right?\n\n1:18:09.460 --> 1:18:13.580\n So we need to go back to the beginning of our conversation\n\n1:18:13.580 --> 1:18:16.100\n with the realization that an average protein\n\n1:18:16.100 --> 1:18:21.100\n is that typically what the CASP has been focusing on\n\n1:18:22.180 --> 1:18:25.820\n is this competition has been focusing\n\n1:18:25.820 --> 1:18:29.220\n on the single, maybe two domain proteins\n\n1:18:29.220 --> 1:18:31.060\n that are still very compact.\n\n1:18:31.060 --> 1:18:35.400\n And even those ones are extremely challenging to solve.\n\n1:18:35.400 --> 1:18:37.660\n But now we talk about, you know,\n\n1:18:37.660 --> 1:18:42.420\n an average protein that has two, three protein domains.\n\n1:18:42.420 --> 1:18:46.920\n If you look at the proteins that are in charge\n\n1:18:46.920 --> 1:18:51.120\n of the, you know, of the process with the neural system,\n\n1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:56.120\n right, perhaps one of the most recently evolved\n\n1:18:58.500 --> 1:19:03.500\n sort of systems in an organism, right?\n\n1:19:03.500 --> 1:19:06.360\n All of them, well, the majority of them\n\n1:19:06.360 --> 1:19:09.000\n are highly multi domain proteins.\n\n1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:13.520\n So they are, you know, some of them have five, six, seven,\n\n1:19:13.520 --> 1:19:16.840\n you know, and more domains, right?\n\n1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:20.000\n And, you know, we are very far away\n\n1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:22.400\n from understanding how these proteins are folded.\n\n1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:24.440\n So the complexity of the protein matters here.\n\n1:19:24.440 --> 1:19:27.920\n The complexity of the protein modules\n\n1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:30.220\n or the protein domains.\n\n1:19:30.220 --> 1:19:35.220\n So you're saying solved, so the definition\n\n1:19:35.220 --> 1:19:38.620\n of solved here is particularly the CASP competition\n\n1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:41.760\n achieving human level, not human level,\n\n1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:45.620\n achieving experimental level performance\n\n1:19:45.620 --> 1:19:48.520\n on these particular sets of proteins\n\n1:19:48.520 --> 1:19:50.300\n that have been used in these competitions.\n\n1:19:50.300 --> 1:19:54.740\n Well, I mean, you know, I do think that, you know,\n\n1:19:54.740 --> 1:19:57.500\n especially with regards to the alpha fold,\n\n1:19:57.500 --> 1:20:02.500\n you know, it is able to, you know, to solve,\n\n1:20:03.020 --> 1:20:07.360\n you know, at the near experimental level,\n\n1:20:08.980 --> 1:20:13.980\n pre big majority of the more compact proteins\n\n1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:16.360\n like, or protein domains.\n\n1:20:16.360 --> 1:20:18.740\n Because again, in order to understand\n\n1:20:18.740 --> 1:20:22.800\n how the overall protein, you know,\n\n1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:26.220\n multi domain protein fold, we do need to understand\n\n1:20:26.220 --> 1:20:28.760\n the structure of its individual domains.\n\n1:20:28.760 --> 1:20:31.140\n I mean, unlike if you look at alpha zero\n\n1:20:31.140 --> 1:20:36.140\n or like even mu zero, if you look at that work,\n\n1:20:36.500 --> 1:20:39.540\n you know, it's nice reinforcement learning\n\n1:20:39.540 --> 1:20:41.100\n self playing mechanisms are nice\n\n1:20:41.100 --> 1:20:42.380\n cause it's all in simulation.\n\n1:20:42.380 --> 1:20:45.920\n So you can learn from just huge amounts.\n\n1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:47.340\n Like you don't need data.\n\n1:20:47.340 --> 1:20:49.740\n It was like the problem with proteins,\n\n1:20:49.740 --> 1:20:54.540\n like the size, I forget how many 3D structures\n\n1:20:54.540 --> 1:20:56.980\n have been mapped, but the training data is very small.\n\n1:20:56.980 --> 1:20:59.060\n No matter what, it's like millions,\n\n1:20:59.060 --> 1:21:01.400\n maybe a one or two million or something like that,\n\n1:21:01.400 --> 1:21:02.940\n but it's some very small number,\n\n1:21:02.940 --> 1:21:06.820\n but like, it doesn't seem like that's scalable.\n\n1:21:06.820 --> 1:21:09.380\n There has to be, I don't know,\n\n1:21:09.380 --> 1:21:13.100\n it feels like you want to somehow 10 X the data\n\n1:21:13.100 --> 1:21:15.700\n or a hundred X the data somehow.\n\n1:21:15.700 --> 1:21:20.700\n Yes, but we also can take advantage of homology models,\n\n1:21:20.700 --> 1:21:25.700\n right, so the models that are of very good quality\n\n1:21:26.740 --> 1:21:30.660\n because they are essentially obtained\n\n1:21:30.660 --> 1:21:33.720\n based on the evolutionary information, right?\n\n1:21:33.720 --> 1:21:38.540\n So you can, there is a potential to enhance this information\n\n1:21:38.540 --> 1:21:43.540\n and, you know, use it again to empower the training set.\n\n1:21:43.540 --> 1:21:48.540\n And it's, I think, I am actually very optimistic.\n\n1:21:49.780 --> 1:21:54.780\n I think it's been one of this sort of, you know,\n\n1:21:58.100 --> 1:22:03.100\n churning events where you have a system that is,\n\n1:22:05.220 --> 1:22:07.300\n you know, a machine learning system\n\n1:22:07.300 --> 1:22:12.300\n that is truly better than the machine learning system.\n\n1:22:12.300 --> 1:22:15.740\n Better than the sort of the more conventional\n\n1:22:15.740 --> 1:22:17.940\n biophysics based methods.\n\n1:22:17.940 --> 1:22:19.380\n That's a huge leap.\n\n1:22:19.380 --> 1:22:21.280\n This is one of those fun questions,\n\n1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:26.280\n but where would you put it in the ranking\n\n1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:28.540\n of the greatest breakthroughs\n\n1:22:28.540 --> 1:22:30.480\n in artificial intelligence history?\n\n1:22:31.740 --> 1:22:34.940\n So like, okay, so let's see who's in the running.\n\n1:22:34.940 --> 1:22:35.860\n Maybe you can correct me.\n\n1:22:35.860 --> 1:22:39.900\n So you got like AlphaZero and AlphaGo\n\n1:22:39.900 --> 1:22:44.500\n beating the world champion at the game of Go.\n\n1:22:44.500 --> 1:22:48.220\n Thought to be impossible like 20 years ago.\n\n1:22:48.220 --> 1:22:51.340\n Or at least the AI community was highly skeptical.\n\n1:22:51.340 --> 1:22:55.060\n Then you got like also Deep Blue original Kasparov.\n\n1:22:55.060 --> 1:22:56.260\n You have deep learning itself,\n\n1:22:56.260 --> 1:22:58.280\n like the maybe, what would you say,\n\n1:22:58.280 --> 1:23:00.940\n the AlexNet, ImageNet moment.\n\n1:23:00.940 --> 1:23:02.780\n So the first neural network\n\n1:23:02.780 --> 1:23:04.780\n achieving human level performance.\n\n1:23:04.780 --> 1:23:07.860\n Super, that's not true.\n\n1:23:07.860 --> 1:23:10.980\n Achieving like a big leap in performance\n\n1:23:10.980 --> 1:23:12.720\n on the computer vision problem.\n\n1:23:14.420 --> 1:23:18.980\n There is OpenAI, the whole like GPT3,\n\n1:23:18.980 --> 1:23:23.020\n that whole space of transformers and language models\n\n1:23:23.020 --> 1:23:27.120\n just achieving this incredible performance\n\n1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:30.200\n of application of neural networks to language models.\n\n1:23:31.780 --> 1:23:33.540\n Boston Dynamics, pretty cool.\n\n1:23:33.540 --> 1:23:35.220\n Like robotics.\n\n1:23:35.220 --> 1:23:38.200\n People are like, there's no AI.\n\n1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:41.520\n No, no, there's no machine learning currently.\n\n1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:44.520\n But AI is much bigger than machine learning.\n\n1:23:44.520 --> 1:23:48.860\n So that just the engineering aspect,\n\n1:23:48.860 --> 1:23:50.780\n I would say it's one of the greatest accomplishments\n\n1:23:50.780 --> 1:23:52.860\n in engineering side.\n\n1:23:52.860 --> 1:23:56.140\n Engineering meaning like mechanical engineering\n\n1:23:56.140 --> 1:23:57.980\n of robotics ever.\n\n1:23:57.980 --> 1:23:59.500\n Then of course, autonomous vehicles.\n\n1:23:59.500 --> 1:24:01.300\n You can argue for Waymo,\n\n1:24:01.300 --> 1:24:03.580\n which is like the Google self driving car.\n\n1:24:03.580 --> 1:24:05.460\n Or you can argue for Tesla,\n\n1:24:05.460 --> 1:24:07.860\n which is like actually being used\n\n1:24:07.860 --> 1:24:10.740\n by hundreds of thousands of people on the road today,\n\n1:24:10.740 --> 1:24:12.000\n machine learning system.\n\n1:24:13.700 --> 1:24:17.560\n And I don't know if you can, what else is there?\n\n1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:18.700\n But I think that's it.\n\n1:24:18.700 --> 1:24:20.900\n And then AlphaFold, many people are saying\n\n1:24:20.900 --> 1:24:23.300\n is up there, potentially number one.\n\n1:24:23.300 --> 1:24:24.820\n Would you put them at number one?\n\n1:24:24.820 --> 1:24:29.820\n Well, in terms of the impact on the science\n\n1:24:29.820 --> 1:24:34.060\n and on the society beyond, it's definitely,\n\n1:24:34.060 --> 1:24:35.820\n to me would be one of the...\n\n1:24:37.460 --> 1:24:39.060\n Top three?\n\n1:24:39.060 --> 1:24:39.900\n What you want?\n\n1:24:39.900 --> 1:24:43.020\n Maybe, I mean, I'm probably not the best person\n\n1:24:43.020 --> 1:24:45.460\n to answer that.\n\n1:24:45.460 --> 1:24:50.460\n But I do have, I remember my,\n\n1:24:51.540 --> 1:24:56.380\n back in, I think 1997, when Deep Blue,\n\n1:24:56.380 --> 1:25:01.380\n that Kasparov, it was, I mean, it was a shock.\n\n1:25:01.860 --> 1:25:04.180\n I mean, it was, and I think for the,\n\n1:25:04.180 --> 1:25:09.180\n for the pre substantial part of the world,\n\n1:25:14.220 --> 1:25:19.220\n that especially people who have some experience with chess,\n\n1:25:21.740 --> 1:25:25.660\n and realizing how incredibly human this game,\n\n1:25:25.660 --> 1:25:30.220\n how much of a brain power you need\n\n1:25:30.220 --> 1:25:35.220\n to reach those levels of grandmasters, right, level.\n\n1:25:36.020 --> 1:25:37.920\n And it's probably one of the first time,\n\n1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:39.780\n and how good Kasparov was.\n\n1:25:39.780 --> 1:25:42.300\n And again, yeah, so Kasparov's arguably\n\n1:25:42.300 --> 1:25:45.580\n one of the best ever, right?\n\n1:25:45.580 --> 1:25:47.860\n And you get a machine that beats him.\n\n1:25:47.860 --> 1:25:48.820\n All right, so it's...\n\n1:25:48.820 --> 1:25:50.740\n First time a machine probably beat a human\n\n1:25:50.740 --> 1:25:53.720\n at that scale of a thing, of anything.\n\n1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:54.740\n Yes, yes.\n\n1:25:54.740 --> 1:25:57.220\n So that was, to me, that was like, you know,\n\n1:25:57.220 --> 1:26:00.620\n one of the groundbreaking events in the history of AI.\n\n1:26:00.620 --> 1:26:02.340\n Yeah, that's probably number one.\n\n1:26:02.340 --> 1:26:05.460\n Probably, like we don't, it's hard to remember.\n\n1:26:05.460 --> 1:26:08.100\n It's like Muhammad Ali versus, I don't know,\n\n1:26:08.100 --> 1:26:09.900\n any of the Mike Tyson, something like that.\n\n1:26:09.900 --> 1:26:12.740\n It's like, nah, you gotta put Muhammad Ali at number one.\n\n1:26:13.660 --> 1:26:15.300\n Same with Deep Blue,\n\n1:26:15.300 --> 1:26:17.980\n even though it's not machine learning based.\n\n1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:21.540\n Still, it uses advanced search,\n\n1:26:21.540 --> 1:26:24.420\n and search is the integral part of AI, right?\n\n1:26:24.420 --> 1:26:27.660\n It's not, people don't think of it that way at this moment.\n\n1:26:27.660 --> 1:26:30.900\n In vogue currently, search is not seen\n\n1:26:30.900 --> 1:26:34.220\n as a fundamental aspect of intelligence,\n\n1:26:34.220 --> 1:26:37.700\n but it very well, I mean, it very likely is.\n\n1:26:37.700 --> 1:26:39.660\n In fact, I mean, that's what neural networks are,\n\n1:26:39.660 --> 1:26:41.260\n is they're just performing search\n\n1:26:41.260 --> 1:26:43.980\n on the space of parameters, and it's all search.\n\n1:26:45.540 --> 1:26:47.740\n All of intelligence is some form of search,\n\n1:26:47.740 --> 1:26:49.660\n and you just have to become cleverer and clever\n\n1:26:49.660 --> 1:26:50.900\n at that search problem.\n\n1:26:50.900 --> 1:26:53.980\n And I also have another one that you didn't mention\n\n1:26:53.980 --> 1:26:58.260\n that's one of my favorite ones is,\n\n1:26:58.260 --> 1:26:59.860\n so you've probably heard of this,\n\n1:26:59.860 --> 1:27:03.420\n it's, I think it's called Deep Rembrandt.\n\n1:27:03.420 --> 1:27:06.820\n It's the project where they trained,\n\n1:27:06.820 --> 1:27:08.220\n I think there was a collaboration\n\n1:27:08.220 --> 1:27:11.580\n between the sort of the experts\n\n1:27:11.580 --> 1:27:15.500\n in Rembrandt painting in Netherlands,\n\n1:27:15.500 --> 1:27:18.300\n and a group, an artificial intelligence group,\n\n1:27:18.300 --> 1:27:20.220\n where they train an algorithm\n\n1:27:20.220 --> 1:27:22.980\n to replicate the style of the Rembrandt,\n\n1:27:22.980 --> 1:27:26.980\n and they actually printed a portrait\n\n1:27:26.980 --> 1:27:31.180\n that never existed before in the style of Rembrandt.\n\n1:27:32.620 --> 1:27:36.740\n I think they printed it on a sort of,\n\n1:27:36.740 --> 1:27:38.500\n on the canvas that, you know,\n\n1:27:38.500 --> 1:27:42.580\n using pretty much same types of paints and stuff.\n\n1:27:42.580 --> 1:27:44.060\n To me, it was mind blowing.\n\n1:27:44.060 --> 1:27:46.900\n Yeah, and the space of art, that's interesting.\n\n1:27:46.900 --> 1:27:50.100\n There hasn't been, maybe that's it,\n\n1:27:50.100 --> 1:27:54.580\n but I think there hasn't been an image in that moment yet\n\n1:27:54.580 --> 1:27:55.840\n in the space of art.\n\n1:27:56.780 --> 1:27:58.620\n You haven't been able to achieve\n\n1:27:58.620 --> 1:28:01.420\n superhuman level performance in the space of art,\n\n1:28:01.420 --> 1:28:04.660\n even though there's this big famous thing\n\n1:28:04.660 --> 1:28:07.660\n where a piece of art was purchased,\n\n1:28:07.660 --> 1:28:08.700\n I guess for a lot of money.\n\n1:28:08.700 --> 1:28:09.540\n Yes.\n\n1:28:09.540 --> 1:28:11.660\n Yeah, but it's still, you know,\n\n1:28:11.660 --> 1:28:14.060\n people are like in the space of music at least,\n\n1:28:15.620 --> 1:28:19.740\n that's, you know, it's clear that human created pieces\n\n1:28:19.740 --> 1:28:21.700\n are much more popular.\n\n1:28:21.700 --> 1:28:24.420\n So there hasn't been a moment where it's like,\n\n1:28:24.420 --> 1:28:26.700\n oh, this is, we're now,\n\n1:28:26.700 --> 1:28:28.780\n I would say in the space of music,\n\n1:28:28.780 --> 1:28:30.140\n what makes a lot of money,\n\n1:28:30.140 --> 1:28:32.100\n we're talking about serious money,\n\n1:28:32.100 --> 1:28:35.300\n it's music and movies, or like shows and so on,\n\n1:28:35.300 --> 1:28:36.640\n and entertainment.\n\n1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:40.020\n There hasn't been a moment where AI created,\n\n1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:44.460\n AI was able to create a piece of music\n\n1:28:44.460 --> 1:28:49.460\n or a piece of cinema, like Netflix show,\n\n1:28:49.820 --> 1:28:53.540\n that is, you know, that's sufficiently popular\n\n1:28:53.540 --> 1:28:55.260\n to make a ton of money.\n\n1:28:55.260 --> 1:28:56.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:28:56.100 --> 1:28:58.940\n And that moment would be very, very powerful,\n\n1:28:58.940 --> 1:29:01.560\n because that's like, that's an AI system\n\n1:29:01.560 --> 1:29:03.060\n being used to make a lot of money.\n\n1:29:03.060 --> 1:29:05.480\n And like direct, of course, AI tools,\n\n1:29:05.480 --> 1:29:07.140\n like even Premiere, audio editing,\n\n1:29:07.140 --> 1:29:08.780\n all the editing, everything I do,\n\n1:29:08.780 --> 1:29:11.660\n to edit this podcast, there's a lot of AI involved.\n\n1:29:11.660 --> 1:29:13.260\n Actually, this is a program,\n\n1:29:13.260 --> 1:29:15.540\n I wanna talk to those folks, just cause I wanna nerd out,\n\n1:29:15.540 --> 1:29:18.060\n it's called iZotope, I don't know if you're familiar with it.\n\n1:29:18.060 --> 1:29:20.140\n They have a bunch of tools of audio processing,\n\n1:29:20.140 --> 1:29:23.080\n and they have, I think they're Boston based,\n\n1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:26.380\n just, it's so exciting to me to use it,\n\n1:29:26.380 --> 1:29:28.200\n like on the audio here,\n\n1:29:28.200 --> 1:29:30.380\n cause it's all machine learning.\n\n1:29:30.380 --> 1:29:35.380\n It's not, cause most audio production stuff\n\n1:29:35.780 --> 1:29:37.540\n is like any kind of processing you do,\n\n1:29:37.540 --> 1:29:39.500\n it's very basic signal processing,\n\n1:29:39.500 --> 1:29:41.980\n and you're tuning knobs and so on.\n\n1:29:41.980 --> 1:29:43.580\n They have all of that, of course,\n\n1:29:43.580 --> 1:29:46.020\n but they also have all of this machine learning stuff,\n\n1:29:46.020 --> 1:29:48.520\n like where you actually give it training data,\n\n1:29:48.520 --> 1:29:51.740\n you select parts of the audio you train on,\n\n1:29:51.740 --> 1:29:56.380\n you train on it, and it figures stuff out.\n\n1:29:56.380 --> 1:29:58.060\n It's great, it's able to detect,\n\n1:29:59.020 --> 1:30:01.380\n like the ability of it to be able\n\n1:30:01.380 --> 1:30:04.820\n to separate voice and music, for example,\n\n1:30:04.820 --> 1:30:07.260\n or voice and anything, is incredible.\n\n1:30:07.260 --> 1:30:11.140\n Like it just, it's clearly exceptionally good\n\n1:30:11.140 --> 1:30:14.940\n at applying these different neural networks models\n\n1:30:14.940 --> 1:30:17.740\n to just separate the different kinds\n\n1:30:17.740 --> 1:30:19.180\n of signals from the audio.\n\n1:30:19.180 --> 1:30:22.260\n That, okay, so that's really exciting.\n\n1:30:22.260 --> 1:30:24.580\n Photoshop, Adobe people also use it,\n\n1:30:24.580 --> 1:30:28.260\n but to generate a piece of music\n\n1:30:28.260 --> 1:30:31.980\n that will sell millions, a piece of art, yeah.\n\n1:30:31.980 --> 1:30:34.420\n No, I agree, and you know, it's,\n\n1:30:34.420 --> 1:30:39.220\n that's, you know, as I mentioned,\n\n1:30:39.220 --> 1:30:41.700\n I offer my AI class, and you know,\n\n1:30:41.700 --> 1:30:44.660\n an integral part of this is the project, right?\n\n1:30:44.660 --> 1:30:47.340\n So it's my favorite, ultimate favorite part,\n\n1:30:47.340 --> 1:30:51.380\n because it typically, we have these project presentations\n\n1:30:51.380 --> 1:30:53.720\n the last two weeks of the classes,\n\n1:30:53.720 --> 1:30:56.220\n right before, you know, the Christmas break,\n\n1:30:56.220 --> 1:31:00.300\n and it's sort of, it adds this cool excitement,\n\n1:31:00.300 --> 1:31:02.660\n and every time, I mean, I'm amazed, you know,\n\n1:31:02.660 --> 1:31:07.660\n with some projects that people, you know, come up with.\n\n1:31:07.660 --> 1:31:12.060\n And so, and quite a few of them are actually, you know,\n\n1:31:12.060 --> 1:31:17.060\n they have some link to arts.\n\n1:31:17.060 --> 1:31:21.260\n I mean, you know, I think last year we had a group\n\n1:31:21.260 --> 1:31:26.260\n who designed an AI producing hokus, Japanese poems.\n\n1:31:27.660 --> 1:31:28.500\n Oh, wow.\n\n1:31:29.380 --> 1:31:31.820\n So, and some of them, so, you know,\n\n1:31:31.820 --> 1:31:34.780\n it got trained on the English based,\n\n1:31:34.780 --> 1:31:36.460\n haikus, haikus, right?\n\n1:31:36.460 --> 1:31:40.260\n So, and some of them, you know,\n\n1:31:40.260 --> 1:31:43.460\n they get to present, like, the top selection.\n\n1:31:43.460 --> 1:31:44.300\n They were pretty good.\n\n1:31:44.300 --> 1:31:47.020\n I mean, you know, I mean, of course, I'm not a specialist,\n\n1:31:47.020 --> 1:31:49.700\n but you read them, and you see this is real.\n\n1:31:49.700 --> 1:31:50.660\n It seems profound.\n\n1:31:50.660 --> 1:31:52.780\n Yes, yeah, it seems real.\n\n1:31:52.780 --> 1:31:54.060\n So it's kind of cool.\n\n1:31:55.060 --> 1:31:57.940\n We also had a couple of projects where people tried\n\n1:31:57.940 --> 1:32:02.940\n to teach AI how to play, like, rock music, classical music.\n\n1:32:02.940 --> 1:32:05.940\n I think, and popular music.\n\n1:32:05.940 --> 1:32:06.780\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:07.820 --> 1:32:10.620\n Interestingly enough, you know,\n\n1:32:10.620 --> 1:32:14.580\n classical music was among the most difficult ones.\n\n1:32:14.580 --> 1:32:15.420\n Oh, sure.\n\n1:32:15.420 --> 1:32:20.420\n And, you know, of course, if you, if, you know,\n\n1:32:21.780 --> 1:32:23.780\n you know, if you look at the, you know,\n\n1:32:23.780 --> 1:32:28.780\n the, like, grandmasters of music, like Bach, right?\n\n1:32:28.780 --> 1:32:31.940\n So there is a lot of, there is a lot of,\n\n1:32:31.940 --> 1:32:34.820\n there is a lot of almost math.\n\n1:32:34.820 --> 1:32:36.580\n Yeah, well, he's very mathematical.\n\n1:32:36.580 --> 1:32:37.420\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:32:37.420 --> 1:32:41.500\n So this is, I would imagine that at least some style\n\n1:32:41.500 --> 1:32:43.820\n of this music could be picked up,\n\n1:32:43.820 --> 1:32:46.980\n but then you have this completely different spectrum\n\n1:32:46.980 --> 1:32:49.260\n of classical composers.\n\n1:32:49.260 --> 1:32:54.140\n And so, you know, it's almost like, you know,\n\n1:32:54.140 --> 1:32:56.780\n you don't have to sort of look at the data.\n\n1:32:56.780 --> 1:33:01.140\n You just listen to it and say, nah, that's not it, not yet.\n\n1:33:01.140 --> 1:33:02.380\n That's not it, yeah.\n\n1:33:02.380 --> 1:33:03.340\n That's how I feel too.\n\n1:33:03.340 --> 1:33:05.820\n There's OpenAI has, I think, OpenMuse\n\n1:33:05.820 --> 1:33:07.540\n or something like that, the system.\n\n1:33:07.540 --> 1:33:09.740\n It's cool, but it's like, eh,\n\n1:33:09.740 --> 1:33:12.060\n it's not compelling for some reason.\n\n1:33:12.060 --> 1:33:14.180\n It could be a psychological reason too.\n\n1:33:14.180 --> 1:33:17.580\n Maybe we need to have a human being,\n\n1:33:17.580 --> 1:33:19.660\n a tortured soul behind the music.\n\n1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:20.700\n I don't know.\n\n1:33:20.700 --> 1:33:22.220\n Yeah, no, absolutely.\n\n1:33:22.220 --> 1:33:23.940\n I completely agree.\n\n1:33:23.940 --> 1:33:26.580\n But yeah, whether or not we'll have,\n\n1:33:26.580 --> 1:33:29.140\n one day we'll have, you know,\n\n1:33:29.140 --> 1:33:33.340\n a song written by an AI engine\n\n1:33:33.340 --> 1:33:37.980\n to be like in top charts, musical charts,\n\n1:33:37.980 --> 1:33:39.300\n I wouldn't be surprised.\n\n1:33:40.540 --> 1:33:41.740\n I wouldn't be surprised.\n\n1:33:43.380 --> 1:33:44.700\n I wonder if we already have one\n\n1:33:44.700 --> 1:33:46.380\n and it just hasn't been announced.\n\n1:33:48.020 --> 1:33:49.980\n We wouldn't know.\n\n1:33:49.980 --> 1:33:53.940\n How hard is the multi protein folding problem?\n\n1:33:53.940 --> 1:33:57.100\n Is that kind of something you've already mentioned\n\n1:33:57.100 --> 1:33:59.180\n which is baked into this idea of greater\n\n1:33:59.180 --> 1:34:01.180\n and greater complexity of proteins?\n\n1:34:01.180 --> 1:34:03.300\n Like multi domain proteins,\n\n1:34:03.300 --> 1:34:08.300\n is that basically become multi protein complexes?\n\n1:34:08.940 --> 1:34:10.620\n Yes, you got it right.\n\n1:34:10.620 --> 1:34:15.620\n So it's sort of, it has the components\n\n1:34:15.980 --> 1:34:18.460\n of both of protein folding\n\n1:34:18.460 --> 1:34:21.900\n and protein, protein interactions.\n\n1:34:21.900 --> 1:34:24.460\n Because in order for these domains,\n\n1:34:24.460 --> 1:34:27.260\n many of these proteins actually,\n\n1:34:27.260 --> 1:34:30.060\n they never form a stable structure.\n\n1:34:31.140 --> 1:34:33.020\n One of my favorite proteins,\n\n1:34:33.020 --> 1:34:37.700\n and pretty much everyone who works in the,\n\n1:34:37.700 --> 1:34:41.740\n I know, whom I know, who works with proteins,\n\n1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:44.660\n they always have their favorite proteins.\n\n1:34:44.660 --> 1:34:47.660\n Right, so one of my favorite proteins,\n\n1:34:47.660 --> 1:34:49.140\n probably my favorite protein,\n\n1:34:49.140 --> 1:34:51.420\n the one that I worked when I was a postdoc\n\n1:34:51.420 --> 1:34:56.180\n is so called post synaptic density 95, PSD 95 protein.\n\n1:34:56.180 --> 1:35:00.500\n So it's one of the key actors\n\n1:35:00.500 --> 1:35:03.780\n in the majority of neurological processes\n\n1:35:03.780 --> 1:35:04.700\n at the molecular level.\n\n1:35:04.700 --> 1:35:09.700\n So it's a, and essentially it's a key player\n\n1:35:11.060 --> 1:35:13.460\n in the post synaptic density.\n\n1:35:13.460 --> 1:35:17.180\n So this is the crucial part of this synapse\n\n1:35:17.180 --> 1:35:22.180\n where a lot of these chemical processes are happening.\n\n1:35:22.420 --> 1:35:26.220\n So it has five domains, right?\n\n1:35:26.220 --> 1:35:27.460\n So five protein domains.\n\n1:35:27.460 --> 1:35:32.460\n So pretty large proteins, I think 600 something assets.\n\n1:35:35.700 --> 1:35:40.700\n But the way it's organized itself, it's flexible, right?\n\n1:35:41.260 --> 1:35:43.820\n So it acts as a scaffold.\n\n1:35:43.820 --> 1:35:48.820\n So it is used to bring in other proteins.\n\n1:35:49.260 --> 1:35:54.260\n So they start acting in the orchestrated manner, right?\n\n1:35:54.260 --> 1:35:58.780\n So, and the type of the shape of this protein,\n\n1:35:58.780 --> 1:36:02.500\n it's in a way, there are some stable parts of this protein,\n\n1:36:02.500 --> 1:36:04.420\n but there are some flexible.\n\n1:36:04.420 --> 1:36:08.580\n And this flexibility is built in into the protein\n\n1:36:08.580 --> 1:36:13.100\n in order to become sort of this multifunctional machine.\n\n1:36:13.100 --> 1:36:16.460\n So do you think that kind of thing is also learnable\n\n1:36:16.460 --> 1:36:19.340\n through the alpha fold two kind of approach?\n\n1:36:19.340 --> 1:36:22.380\n I mean, the time will tell.\n\n1:36:22.380 --> 1:36:24.460\n Is it another level of complexity?\n\n1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:27.300\n Is it like how big of a jump in complexity\n\n1:36:27.300 --> 1:36:28.140\n is that whole thing?\n\n1:36:28.140 --> 1:36:31.340\n To me, it's yet another level of complexity\n\n1:36:31.340 --> 1:36:35.140\n because when we talk about protein, protein interactions,\n\n1:36:35.140 --> 1:36:38.820\n and there is actually a different challenge for this\n\n1:36:38.820 --> 1:36:43.420\n called Capri, and so this, that is focused specifically\n\n1:36:43.420 --> 1:36:47.060\n on macromolecular interactions, protein, protein, protein,\n\n1:36:47.060 --> 1:36:48.540\n DNA, et cetera.\n\n1:36:48.540 --> 1:36:53.540\n So, but it's, there are different mechanisms\n\n1:36:56.020 --> 1:36:58.740\n that govern molecular interactions\n\n1:36:58.740 --> 1:37:00.740\n and that need to be picked up,\n\n1:37:00.740 --> 1:37:03.660\n say by a machine learning algorithm.\n\n1:37:03.660 --> 1:37:06.500\n Interestingly enough, we actually,\n\n1:37:06.500 --> 1:37:11.500\n we participated for a few years in this competition.\n\n1:37:11.740 --> 1:37:14.900\n We typically don't participate in competitions,\n\n1:37:14.900 --> 1:37:19.820\n I don't know, don't have enough time,\n\n1:37:19.820 --> 1:37:23.700\n because it's very intensive, it's a very intensive process.\n\n1:37:23.700 --> 1:37:28.700\n But we participated back in about 10 years ago or so.\n\n1:37:30.580 --> 1:37:32.660\n And the way we entered this competition,\n\n1:37:32.660 --> 1:37:35.420\n so we design a scoring function, right?\n\n1:37:35.420 --> 1:37:37.580\n So the function that evaluates\n\n1:37:37.580 --> 1:37:40.540\n whether or not your protein, protein interaction\n\n1:37:40.540 --> 1:37:43.380\n is supposed to look like experimentally solved, right?\n\n1:37:43.380 --> 1:37:45.900\n So the scoring function is very critical part\n\n1:37:45.900 --> 1:37:49.820\n of the model prediction.\n\n1:37:49.820 --> 1:37:52.740\n So we designed it to be a machine learning one.\n\n1:37:52.740 --> 1:37:56.620\n And so it was one of the first machine learning\n\n1:37:56.620 --> 1:38:00.020\n based scoring function used in Capri.\n\n1:38:00.020 --> 1:38:05.020\n And we essentially learned what should contribute,\n\n1:38:06.580 --> 1:38:08.860\n what are the critical components contributing\n\n1:38:08.860 --> 1:38:10.540\n into the protein, protein interaction.\n\n1:38:10.540 --> 1:38:13.340\n So this could be converted into a learning problem\n\n1:38:13.340 --> 1:38:15.620\n and thereby it could be learned?\n\n1:38:15.620 --> 1:38:17.020\n I believe so, yes.\n\n1:38:17.020 --> 1:38:20.460\n Do you think AlphaFold2 or something similar to it\n\n1:38:20.460 --> 1:38:24.300\n from DeepMind or somebody else will be,\n\n1:38:24.300 --> 1:38:28.660\n will result in a Nobel Prize or multiple Nobel Prizes?\n\n1:38:28.660 --> 1:38:33.300\n So like, you know, obviously, maybe not so obviously,\n\n1:38:33.300 --> 1:38:37.420\n you can't give a Nobel Prize to a computer program.\n\n1:38:38.660 --> 1:38:42.140\n At least for now, give it to the designers of that program.\n\n1:38:42.140 --> 1:38:46.060\n But do you see one or multiple Nobel Prizes\n\n1:38:46.060 --> 1:38:51.060\n where AlphaFold2 is like a large percentage\n\n1:38:51.700 --> 1:38:54.860\n of what that prize is given for?\n\n1:38:54.860 --> 1:38:58.980\n Would it lead to discoveries at the level of Nobel Prizes?\n\n1:39:00.540 --> 1:39:05.420\n I mean, I think we are definitely destined\n\n1:39:05.420 --> 1:39:08.740\n to see the Nobel Prize becoming sort of,\n\n1:39:08.740 --> 1:39:12.340\n to be evolving with the evolution of science\n\n1:39:12.340 --> 1:39:14.540\n and the evolution of science as such\n\n1:39:14.540 --> 1:39:17.860\n that it now becomes like really multi facets, right?\n\n1:39:17.860 --> 1:39:21.340\n So where you don't really have like a unique discipline,\n\n1:39:21.340 --> 1:39:25.660\n you have sort of the, a lot of cross disciplinary talks\n\n1:39:25.660 --> 1:39:28.740\n in order to achieve sort of, you know,\n\n1:39:28.740 --> 1:39:32.380\n really big advancements, you know.\n\n1:39:32.380 --> 1:39:37.380\n So I think, you know, the computational methods\n\n1:39:39.180 --> 1:39:42.500\n will be acknowledged in one way or another.\n\n1:39:42.500 --> 1:39:46.860\n And as a matter of fact, you know,\n\n1:39:46.860 --> 1:39:50.580\n they were first acknowledged back in 2013, right?\n\n1:39:50.580 --> 1:39:55.580\n Where, you know, the first three people were, you know,\n\n1:39:56.500 --> 1:40:00.540\n awarded the Nobel Prize for study the protein folding,\n\n1:40:00.540 --> 1:40:01.500\n right, the principle.\n\n1:40:01.500 --> 1:40:03.820\n And, you know, I think all three of them\n\n1:40:03.820 --> 1:40:06.940\n are computational biophysicists, right?\n\n1:40:06.940 --> 1:40:11.940\n So, you know, that I think is unavoidable.\n\n1:40:13.260 --> 1:40:16.580\n You know, it will come with the time.\n\n1:40:16.580 --> 1:40:21.580\n The fact that, you know, alpha fold and, you know,\n\n1:40:23.540 --> 1:40:26.340\n similar approaches, because again, it's a matter of time\n\n1:40:26.340 --> 1:40:31.340\n that people will embrace this, you know, principle\n\n1:40:31.700 --> 1:40:34.940\n and we'll see more and more such, you know,\n\n1:40:34.940 --> 1:40:36.940\n such tools coming into play.\n\n1:40:36.940 --> 1:40:41.940\n But, you know, these methods will be critical\n\n1:40:41.940 --> 1:40:46.940\n in a scientific discovery, no doubts about it.\n\n1:40:47.700 --> 1:40:51.500\n On the engineering side, maybe a dark question,\n\n1:40:51.500 --> 1:40:53.860\n but do you think it's possible to use\n\n1:40:53.860 --> 1:40:55.140\n these machine learning methods\n\n1:40:55.140 --> 1:40:59.020\n to start to engineer proteins?\n\n1:40:59.020 --> 1:41:04.020\n And the next question is something quite a few biologists\n\n1:41:04.660 --> 1:41:07.300\n are against, some are for, for study purposes,\n\n1:41:07.300 --> 1:41:09.620\n is to engineer viruses.\n\n1:41:09.620 --> 1:41:12.620\n Do you think machine learning, like something like alpha fold\n\n1:41:12.620 --> 1:41:14.780\n could be used to engineer viruses?\n\n1:41:14.780 --> 1:41:16.980\n So to answer the first question, you know,\n\n1:41:16.980 --> 1:41:21.660\n it has been, you know, a part of the research\n\n1:41:21.660 --> 1:41:25.500\n in the protein science, the protein design is, you know,\n\n1:41:25.500 --> 1:41:29.180\n is a very prominent areas of research.\n\n1:41:29.180 --> 1:41:32.020\n Of course, you know, one of the pioneers is David Baker\n\n1:41:32.020 --> 1:41:34.900\n and Rosetta algorithm that, you know,\n\n1:41:34.900 --> 1:41:39.740\n essentially was doing the de novo design and was used\n\n1:41:39.740 --> 1:41:41.580\n to design new proteins, you know.\n\n1:41:41.580 --> 1:41:44.220\n And design of proteins means design of function.\n\n1:41:44.220 --> 1:41:47.300\n So like when you design a protein, you can control,\n\n1:41:47.300 --> 1:41:49.100\n I mean, the whole point of a protein\n\n1:41:49.100 --> 1:41:52.180\n with the protein structure comes a function,\n\n1:41:52.180 --> 1:41:53.700\n like it's doing something.\n\n1:41:53.700 --> 1:41:54.540\n Correct.\n\n1:41:54.540 --> 1:41:56.060\n So you can design different things.\n\n1:41:56.060 --> 1:41:58.140\n So you can, yeah, so you can, well,\n\n1:41:58.140 --> 1:42:00.700\n you can look at the proteins from the functional perspective.\n\n1:42:00.700 --> 1:42:02.700\n You can also look at the proteins\n\n1:42:02.700 --> 1:42:04.180\n from the structural perspective, right?\n\n1:42:04.180 --> 1:42:05.700\n So the structural building blocks.\n\n1:42:05.700 --> 1:42:07.660\n So if you want to have a building block\n\n1:42:07.660 --> 1:42:10.540\n of a certain shape, you can try to achieve it\n\n1:42:10.540 --> 1:42:13.140\n by, you know, introducing a new protein sequence\n\n1:42:13.140 --> 1:42:17.260\n and predicting, you know, how it will fold.\n\n1:42:17.260 --> 1:42:22.060\n So with that, I mean, it's a natural,\n\n1:42:22.060 --> 1:42:25.820\n one of the, you know, natural applications\n\n1:42:25.820 --> 1:42:28.220\n of these algorithms.\n\n1:42:28.220 --> 1:42:34.140\n Now, talking about engineering a virus.\n\n1:42:34.140 --> 1:42:35.140\n With machine learning.\n\n1:42:35.140 --> 1:42:36.380\n With machine learning, right?\n\n1:42:36.380 --> 1:42:41.740\n So, well, you know, so luckily for us,\n\n1:42:41.740 --> 1:42:46.780\n I mean, we don't have that much data, right?\n\n1:42:46.780 --> 1:42:47.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:47.580 --> 1:42:50.100\n We actually, right now, one of the projects\n\n1:42:50.100 --> 1:42:53.700\n that we are carrying on in the lab\n\n1:42:53.700 --> 1:42:56.940\n is we're trying to develop a machine learning algorithm\n\n1:42:56.940 --> 1:42:59.300\n that determines the,\n\n1:42:59.300 --> 1:43:02.700\n whether or not the current strain is pathogenic.\n\n1:43:02.700 --> 1:43:04.620\n And the current strain of the coronavirus.\n\n1:43:04.620 --> 1:43:06.100\n Of the virus.\n\n1:43:06.100 --> 1:43:08.980\n I mean, so there are applications to coronaviruses\n\n1:43:08.980 --> 1:43:11.460\n because we have strains of SARS COVID 2,\n\n1:43:11.460 --> 1:43:14.580\n also SARS COVID, MERS that are pathogenic,\n\n1:43:14.580 --> 1:43:17.620\n but we also have strains of other coronaviruses\n\n1:43:17.620 --> 1:43:20.140\n that are, you know, not pathogenic.\n\n1:43:20.140 --> 1:43:24.060\n I mean, the common cold viruses and, you know,\n\n1:43:24.060 --> 1:43:25.580\n some other ones, right?\n\n1:43:25.580 --> 1:43:28.980\n So, so pathogenic meaning spreading.\n\n1:43:28.980 --> 1:43:33.780\n Pathogenic means actually inflicting damage.\n\n1:43:33.780 --> 1:43:35.340\n Correct.\n\n1:43:35.340 --> 1:43:37.020\n There are also some, you know,\n\n1:43:37.020 --> 1:43:41.780\n seasonal versus pandemic strains of influenza, right?\n\n1:43:41.780 --> 1:43:45.220\n And determining the, what are the molecular determinant,\n\n1:43:45.220 --> 1:43:46.060\n right?\n\n1:43:46.060 --> 1:43:48.300\n So that are built in, into the protein sequence,\n\n1:43:48.300 --> 1:43:50.700\n into the gene sequence, right?\n\n1:43:50.700 --> 1:43:52.980\n So, and whether or not the machine learning\n\n1:43:52.980 --> 1:43:57.980\n can determine those, those components, right?\n\n1:43:58.420 --> 1:43:59.260\n Oh, interesting.\n\n1:43:59.260 --> 1:44:00.660\n So like using machine learning to do,\n\n1:44:00.660 --> 1:44:03.940\n that's really interesting to, to, to given,\n\n1:44:03.940 --> 1:44:07.380\n give the input is like what the entire,\n\n1:44:07.380 --> 1:44:09.740\n the protein sequence and then determine\n\n1:44:09.740 --> 1:44:12.340\n if this thing is going to be able to do damage\n\n1:44:12.340 --> 1:44:14.620\n to a biological system.\n\n1:44:14.620 --> 1:44:15.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:44:15.900 --> 1:44:16.740\n So, so I mean,\n\n1:44:16.740 --> 1:44:17.580\n It's a good machine learning,\n\n1:44:17.580 --> 1:44:19.380\n you're saying we don't have enough data for that?\n\n1:44:19.380 --> 1:44:22.620\n We, I mean, for, for this specific one, we do.\n\n1:44:22.620 --> 1:44:24.460\n We might actually, I have, you know,\n\n1:44:24.460 --> 1:44:27.260\n have to back up on this because we're still in the process.\n\n1:44:27.260 --> 1:44:31.660\n There was one work that appeared in bioarchive\n\n1:44:31.660 --> 1:44:34.900\n by Eugene Kunin, who is one of these, you know,\n\n1:44:34.900 --> 1:44:38.140\n pioneers in, in, in evolutionary genomics.\n\n1:44:39.020 --> 1:44:42.820\n And they tried to look at this, but, you know,\n\n1:44:42.820 --> 1:44:46.060\n the methods were sort of standard, you know,\n\n1:44:46.060 --> 1:44:48.620\n supervised learning methods.\n\n1:44:48.620 --> 1:44:51.340\n And now the question is, you know,\n\n1:44:51.340 --> 1:44:56.340\n can you advance it further by, by using, you know,\n\n1:44:56.660 --> 1:44:58.620\n not so standard methods, you know?\n\n1:44:58.620 --> 1:45:01.140\n So there's obviously a lot of hope in,\n\n1:45:01.140 --> 1:45:05.580\n in transfer learning where you can actually try to transfer\n\n1:45:05.580 --> 1:45:08.060\n the information that the machine learning learns about\n\n1:45:08.060 --> 1:45:11.340\n the proper protein sequences, right?\n\n1:45:11.340 --> 1:45:16.140\n And, you know, so, so there is some promise\n\n1:45:16.140 --> 1:45:18.740\n in going this direction, but if we have this,\n\n1:45:18.740 --> 1:45:21.060\n it would be extremely useful because then\n\n1:45:21.060 --> 1:45:24.100\n we could essentially forecast the potential mutations\n\n1:45:24.100 --> 1:45:26.300\n that would make the current strain\n\n1:45:26.300 --> 1:45:27.900\n more or less pathogenic.\n\n1:45:27.900 --> 1:45:31.140\n Anticipate, anticipate them from a vaccine development,\n\n1:45:31.140 --> 1:45:34.580\n for the treatment, antiviral drug development.\n\n1:45:34.580 --> 1:45:36.860\n That, that would be a very crucial task.\n\n1:45:36.860 --> 1:45:41.860\n But you could also use that system to then say,\n\n1:45:42.180 --> 1:45:45.260\n how would we potentially modify this virus\n\n1:45:45.260 --> 1:45:47.940\n to make it more pathogenic?\n\n1:45:47.940 --> 1:45:49.660\n This, that's true.\n\n1:45:49.660 --> 1:45:50.500\n That's true.\n\n1:45:50.500 --> 1:45:55.500\n And then, you know, the, again,\n\n1:45:55.980 --> 1:45:59.700\n the hope is, well, several things, right?\n\n1:45:59.700 --> 1:46:02.140\n So one is that, you know, it's,\n\n1:46:02.140 --> 1:46:06.780\n even if you design a, you know, a sequence, right?\n\n1:46:06.780 --> 1:46:11.780\n So to carry out the actual experimental biology,\n\n1:46:12.540 --> 1:46:16.820\n to ensure that all the components working, you know,\n\n1:46:16.820 --> 1:46:19.060\n is a completely different matter.\n\n1:46:19.060 --> 1:46:19.900\n Difficult process.\n\n1:46:19.900 --> 1:46:20.860\n Yes.\n\n1:46:20.860 --> 1:46:24.420\n Then the, you know, we've seen in the past,\n\n1:46:24.420 --> 1:46:27.660\n there could be some regulation of the moment\n\n1:46:27.660 --> 1:46:30.420\n the scientific community recognizes\n\n1:46:30.420 --> 1:46:34.620\n that it's now becoming no longer a sort of a fun puzzle\n\n1:46:34.620 --> 1:46:36.660\n to, you know, for machine learning.\n\n1:46:36.660 --> 1:46:37.860\n Could be open.\n\n1:46:37.860 --> 1:46:40.420\n Yeah, so then there might be some regulation.\n\n1:46:40.420 --> 1:46:45.420\n So I think back in, what, 2015, there was, you know,\n\n1:46:45.780 --> 1:46:49.500\n there was an issue on regulating the research\n\n1:46:49.500 --> 1:46:52.700\n on influenza strains, right?\n\n1:46:52.700 --> 1:46:55.580\n There were several groups, you know,\n\n1:46:55.580 --> 1:46:58.060\n used sort of the mutation analysis\n\n1:46:58.060 --> 1:47:01.820\n to determine whether or not this strain will jump\n\n1:47:01.820 --> 1:47:03.300\n from one species to another.\n\n1:47:03.300 --> 1:47:06.540\n And I think there was like a half a year moratorium\n\n1:47:06.540 --> 1:47:09.780\n on the research on the paper published\n\n1:47:09.780 --> 1:47:13.580\n until, you know, scientists, you know, analyzed it\n\n1:47:13.580 --> 1:47:16.440\n and decided that it's actually safe.\n\n1:47:16.440 --> 1:47:17.620\n I forgot what that's called.\n\n1:47:17.620 --> 1:47:20.020\n Something of function, test of function.\n\n1:47:20.020 --> 1:47:20.860\n Gain of function.\n\n1:47:20.860 --> 1:47:22.380\n Gain of function, yeah.\n\n1:47:22.380 --> 1:47:24.020\n Gain of function, loss of function, that's right.\n\n1:47:24.020 --> 1:47:24.860\n Sorry.\n\n1:47:26.420 --> 1:47:29.620\n It's like, let's watch this thing mutate for a while\n\n1:47:29.620 --> 1:47:33.780\n to see like, to see what kind of things we can observe.\n\n1:47:33.780 --> 1:47:36.320\n I guess I'm not so much worried\n\n1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:38.620\n about that kind of research if there's a lot of regulation\n\n1:47:38.620 --> 1:47:42.780\n and if it's done very well and with competence and seriously.\n\n1:47:42.780 --> 1:47:46.980\n I am more worried about kind of this, you know,\n\n1:47:46.980 --> 1:47:49.580\n the underlying aspect of this question\n\n1:47:49.580 --> 1:47:51.280\n is more like 50 years from now.\n\n1:47:52.920 --> 1:47:54.940\n Speaking to the Drake equation,\n\n1:47:54.940 --> 1:47:57.300\n one of the parameters in the Drake equation\n\n1:47:57.300 --> 1:47:59.820\n is how long civilizations last.\n\n1:47:59.820 --> 1:48:03.860\n And that seems to be the most important value actually\n\n1:48:03.860 --> 1:48:06.100\n for calculating if there's other alien\n\n1:48:06.100 --> 1:48:08.040\n intelligent civilizations out there.\n\n1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:10.960\n That's where there's most variability.\n\n1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:15.060\n Assuming like if life, if that percentage\n\n1:48:15.060 --> 1:48:19.380\n that life can emerge is like not zero,\n\n1:48:19.380 --> 1:48:21.260\n like if we're a super unique,\n\n1:48:21.260 --> 1:48:23.940\n then it's the how long we last\n\n1:48:23.940 --> 1:48:26.180\n is basically the most important thing.\n\n1:48:26.180 --> 1:48:29.020\n So from a selfish perspective,\n\n1:48:29.020 --> 1:48:32.020\n but also from a Drake equation perspective,\n\n1:48:32.020 --> 1:48:35.020\n I'm worried about our civilization lasting.\n\n1:48:35.020 --> 1:48:37.620\n And you kind of think about all the ways\n\n1:48:37.620 --> 1:48:39.140\n in which machine learning can be used\n\n1:48:39.140 --> 1:48:44.140\n to design greater weapons of destruction, right?\n\n1:48:45.700 --> 1:48:48.620\n And I mean, one way to ask that\n\n1:48:48.620 --> 1:48:50.580\n if you look sort of 50 years from now,\n\n1:48:50.580 --> 1:48:52.620\n a hundred years from now,\n\n1:48:52.620 --> 1:48:55.780\n would you be more worried about natural pandemics\n\n1:48:55.780 --> 1:48:57.560\n or engineered pandemics?\n\n1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:02.640\n Like who's the better designer of viruses,\n\n1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:05.980\n nature or humans if we look down the line?\n\n1:49:05.980 --> 1:49:10.140\n I think in my view, I would still be worried\n\n1:49:10.140 --> 1:49:14.300\n about the natural pandemics simply because I mean,\n\n1:49:14.300 --> 1:49:19.300\n the capacity of the nature producing this.\n\n1:49:20.740 --> 1:49:22.700\n It does pretty good job, right?\n\n1:49:22.700 --> 1:49:23.540\n Yes.\n\n1:49:23.540 --> 1:49:25.280\n And the motivation for using virus,\n\n1:49:25.280 --> 1:49:29.020\n engineering viruses as a weapon is a weird one\n\n1:49:29.020 --> 1:49:31.480\n because maybe you can correct me on this,\n\n1:49:31.480 --> 1:49:35.620\n but it seems very difficult to target a virus, right?\n\n1:49:35.620 --> 1:49:38.400\n The whole point of a weapon, the way a rocket works,\n\n1:49:38.400 --> 1:49:40.100\n if a starting point, you have an end point\n\n1:49:40.100 --> 1:49:42.340\n and you're trying to hit a target,\n\n1:49:42.340 --> 1:49:44.660\n to hit a target with a virus is very difficult.\n\n1:49:44.660 --> 1:49:46.820\n It's basically just, right?\n\n1:49:47.980 --> 1:49:50.060\n The target would be the human species.\n\n1:49:51.940 --> 1:49:52.860\n Oh man.\n\n1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:54.780\n Yeah, I have a hope in us.\n\n1:49:54.780 --> 1:49:58.260\n I'm forever optimistic that we will not,\n\n1:49:58.260 --> 1:50:01.620\n there's insufficient evil in the world\n\n1:50:01.620 --> 1:50:04.560\n to lead to that kind of destruction.\n\n1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:07.780\n Well, I also hope that, I mean, that's what we see.\n\n1:50:07.780 --> 1:50:11.780\n I mean, with the way we are getting connected,\n\n1:50:11.780 --> 1:50:14.460\n the world is getting connected.\n\n1:50:14.460 --> 1:50:19.460\n I think it helps for the world to become more transparent.\n\n1:50:21.660 --> 1:50:22.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:27.100\n So the information spread is,\n\n1:50:27.100 --> 1:50:31.660\n I think it's one of the key things for the society\n\n1:50:31.660 --> 1:50:36.460\n to become more balanced one way or another.\n\n1:50:36.460 --> 1:50:38.340\n This is something that people disagree with me on,\n\n1:50:38.340 --> 1:50:41.900\n but I do think that the kind of secrecy\n\n1:50:41.900 --> 1:50:43.460\n that governments have.\n\n1:50:43.460 --> 1:50:47.060\n So you're kind of speaking more to the other aspects,\n\n1:50:47.060 --> 1:50:49.700\n like a research community being more open,\n\n1:50:49.700 --> 1:50:52.160\n companies are being more open.\n\n1:50:52.160 --> 1:50:53.880\n Government is still like,\n\n1:50:55.900 --> 1:50:57.860\n we're talking about like military secrets.\n\n1:50:57.860 --> 1:51:01.380\n I think military secrets of the kind\n\n1:51:01.380 --> 1:51:03.700\n that could destroy the world\n\n1:51:03.700 --> 1:51:07.300\n will become also a thing of the 20th century.\n\n1:51:07.300 --> 1:51:09.320\n It'll become more and more open.\n\n1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:10.160\n Yeah.\n\n1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:13.220\n I think nations will lose power in the 21st century,\n\n1:51:13.220 --> 1:51:15.960\n like lose sufficient power towards secrecies.\n\n1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:18.860\n Transparency is more beneficial than secrecy,\n\n1:51:18.860 --> 1:51:21.140\n but of course it's not obvious.\n\n1:51:21.140 --> 1:51:22.180\n Let's hope so.\n\n1:51:22.180 --> 1:51:27.180\n Let's hope so that the governments\n\n1:51:27.180 --> 1:51:31.300\n will become more transparent.\n\n1:51:31.300 --> 1:51:35.260\n What, so we last talked, I think in March or April,\n\n1:51:35.260 --> 1:51:36.740\n what have you learned?\n\n1:51:36.740 --> 1:51:40.460\n How has your philosophical, psychological,\n\n1:51:40.460 --> 1:51:43.820\n biological worldview changed since then?\n\n1:51:43.820 --> 1:51:46.100\n Or you've been studying it nonstop\n\n1:51:46.100 --> 1:51:48.900\n from a computational biology perspective.\n\n1:51:48.900 --> 1:51:51.140\n How has your understanding and thoughts about this virus\n\n1:51:51.140 --> 1:51:54.460\n changed over those months from the beginning to today?\n\n1:51:54.460 --> 1:51:58.660\n One thing that I was really amazed at\n\n1:51:58.660 --> 1:52:03.140\n how efficient the scientific community was.\n\n1:52:03.140 --> 1:52:08.140\n I mean, and even just judging on this very narrow domain\n\n1:52:10.100 --> 1:52:13.060\n of protein structure and understanding\n\n1:52:13.060 --> 1:52:17.600\n the structural characterization of this virus\n\n1:52:17.600 --> 1:52:19.860\n from the components point of view,\n\n1:52:19.860 --> 1:52:21.460\n whole virus point of view.\n\n1:52:21.460 --> 1:52:26.460\n If you look at SARS, something that happened less than 20,\n\n1:52:31.020 --> 1:52:34.060\n but close enough, 20 years ago,\n\n1:52:34.980 --> 1:52:38.500\n and you see what, when it happened,\n\n1:52:38.500 --> 1:52:42.460\n what was sort of the response by the scientific community,\n\n1:52:42.460 --> 1:52:47.100\n you see that the structure characterizations did a cure,\n\n1:52:47.100 --> 1:52:51.660\n but it took several years, right?\n\n1:52:51.660 --> 1:52:54.940\n Now the things that took several years,\n\n1:52:54.940 --> 1:52:56.900\n it's a matter of months, right?\n\n1:52:56.900 --> 1:53:01.620\n So we see that the research pop up.\n\n1:53:01.620 --> 1:53:03.940\n We are at the unprecedented level\n\n1:53:03.940 --> 1:53:05.980\n in terms of the sequencing, right?\n\n1:53:05.980 --> 1:53:10.980\n Never before we had a single virus sequence so many times,\n\n1:53:10.980 --> 1:53:15.980\n so which allows us to actually to trace very precisely\n\n1:53:16.380 --> 1:53:21.380\n the sort of the evolutionary nature of this virus,\n\n1:53:21.380 --> 1:53:26.380\n what happens, and it's not just this virus independently\n\n1:53:27.420 --> 1:53:32.420\n of everything, it's the sequence of this virus\n\n1:53:32.420 --> 1:53:36.420\n linked, anchored to the specific geographic place\n\n1:53:36.420 --> 1:53:24.540\n to specific\n\n1:53:24.540 --> 1:53:29.540\n people, because our genotype influences also\n\n1:53:31.540 --> 1:53:35.540\n the evolution of this, it's always a host pathogen,\n\n1:53:35.540 --> 1:53:38.540\n core evolution that, you know,\n\n1:53:38.540 --> 1:53:41.540\n it's not just the virus, it's the sequence of this virus,\n\n1:53:41.540 --> 1:53:44.540\n it's the sequence of this virus linked to the specific\n\n1:53:44.540 --> 1:53:48.540\n geographic place, it's the sequence of this virus\n\n1:53:48.540 --> 1:53:52.540\n linked to the specific geographic place to specific people,\n\n1:53:52.540 --> 1:53:55.540\n that, you know, occurs.\n\n1:53:55.540 --> 1:53:58.540\n It'd be cool if we also had a lot more data about,\n\n1:53:58.540 --> 1:54:02.540\n so that the spread of this virus, not maybe,\n\n1:54:02.540 --> 1:54:06.540\n well, it'd be nice if we had it for like contact tracing\n\n1:54:06.540 --> 1:54:09.540\n purposes for this virus, but it'd be also nice if we had it\n\n1:54:09.540 --> 1:54:12.540\n for the study for future viruses to be able to respond\n\n1:54:12.540 --> 1:54:15.540\n and so on, but it's already nice that we have geographical\n\n1:54:15.540 --> 1:54:18.540\n data and the basic data from individual humans, yeah.\n\n1:54:18.540 --> 1:54:22.540\n Exactly, no, I think contact tracing is obviously\n\n1:54:22.540 --> 1:54:26.540\n a key component in understanding\n\n1:54:26.540 --> 1:54:29.540\n the spread of this virus.\n\n1:54:29.540 --> 1:54:31.540\n There is also, there is a number of challenges, right?\n\n1:54:31.540 --> 1:54:35.540\n So XPRIZE is one of them, we\n\n1:54:35.540 --> 1:54:39.540\n just recently took a part of\n\n1:54:39.540 --> 1:54:43.540\n this competition, it's the prediction of the\n\n1:54:43.540 --> 1:54:47.540\n number of infections in different regions.\n\n1:54:47.540 --> 1:54:48.540\n Oh, sure.\n\n1:54:48.540 --> 1:54:52.540\n So, you know, obviously the AI\n\n1:54:52.540 --> 1:54:55.540\n is the main topic in those predictions.\n\n1:54:55.540 --> 1:54:59.540\n Yeah, but it's still, the data, I mean, that's a competition,\n\n1:54:59.540 --> 1:55:03.540\n but the data is weak\n\n1:55:03.540 --> 1:55:07.540\n on the training. Like, it's great,\n\n1:55:07.540 --> 1:55:11.540\n it's much more than probably before, but like, it'd be nice if it was like\n\n1:55:11.540 --> 1:55:15.540\n really rich. I talked to Michael Mina from\n\n1:55:15.540 --> 1:55:19.540\n Harvard, I mean, he dreams that the community comes together with like a\n\n1:55:19.540 --> 1:55:23.540\n weather map to where viruses, right, like\n\n1:55:23.540 --> 1:55:27.540\n really high resolution sensors on like how\n\n1:55:27.540 --> 1:55:31.540\n from person to person the viruses that travel, all the different kinds of viruses, right?\n\n1:55:31.540 --> 1:55:35.540\n Because there's a ton of them, and then you'd be able to tell\n\n1:55:35.540 --> 1:55:39.540\n the story that you've spoken about\n\n1:55:39.540 --> 1:55:43.540\n of the evolution of these viruses, like day to day mutations that\n\n1:55:43.540 --> 1:55:47.540\n are occurring. I mean, that'd be fascinating just from a perspective of\n\n1:55:47.540 --> 1:55:51.540\n study and from the perspective of being able to respond to future pandemics.\n\n1:55:51.540 --> 1:55:55.540\n That's ultimately what I'm worried about. People love\n\n1:55:55.540 --> 1:55:59.540\n books. Is there some three\n\n1:55:59.540 --> 1:56:03.540\n or whatever number of books, technical, fiction, philosophical, that\n\n1:56:03.540 --> 1:56:07.540\n brought you joy in life, had an impact on your life,\n\n1:56:07.540 --> 1:56:11.540\n and maybe some that you would recommend others?\n\n1:56:11.540 --> 1:56:15.540\n I'll give you three very different books, and I also have a special runner up.\n\n1:56:15.540 --> 1:56:19.540\n Honorable mention.\n\n1:56:19.540 --> 1:56:23.540\n I mean, it's an audiobook, and that's\n\n1:56:23.540 --> 1:56:27.540\n some specific reason behind it. So the first book is\n\n1:56:27.540 --> 1:56:31.540\n something that sort of impacted my earlier\n\n1:56:31.540 --> 1:56:35.540\n stage of life, and I'm probably not going to be very original here.\n\n1:56:35.540 --> 1:56:39.540\n It's Bulgakov's Master and Margarita.\n\n1:56:39.540 --> 1:56:43.540\n For a Russian, maybe it's not super original,\n\n1:56:43.540 --> 1:56:47.540\n but it's a really powerful book, even in English.\n\n1:56:47.540 --> 1:56:51.540\n It is incredibly powerful, and\n\n1:56:51.540 --> 1:56:55.540\n I mean, the way it ends.\n\n1:56:55.540 --> 1:56:59.540\n I still have goosebumps when I read\n\n1:56:59.540 --> 1:57:03.540\n the very last sort of, it's called prologue, where\n\n1:57:03.540 --> 1:57:07.540\n it's just so powerful. What impact did it have on you? What ideas?\n\n1:57:07.540 --> 1:57:11.540\n What insights did you get from it? I was just taken by\n\n1:57:11.540 --> 1:57:15.540\n the fact that\n\n1:57:15.540 --> 1:57:19.540\n you have those parallel lives\n\n1:57:19.540 --> 1:57:23.540\n apart from many centuries, and\n\n1:57:23.540 --> 1:57:27.540\n somehow they got sort of intertwined into\n\n1:57:27.540 --> 1:57:31.540\n one story, and that\n\n1:57:31.540 --> 1:57:35.540\n to me was fascinating. And of course\n\n1:57:35.540 --> 1:57:39.540\n the romantic part of this book is like\n\n1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:43.540\n it's not just romance, it's like the romance\n\n1:57:43.540 --> 1:57:47.540\n empowered by sort of magic, right?\n\n1:57:47.540 --> 1:57:51.540\n And maybe on top of that, you have some irony,\n\n1:57:51.540 --> 1:57:55.540\n which is unavoidable, right? Because it was that\n\n1:57:55.540 --> 1:57:59.540\n Soviet time. But it's very deeply Russian, so that's\n\n1:57:59.540 --> 1:58:03.540\n the wit, the humor, the pain, the love,\n\n1:58:03.540 --> 1:58:07.540\n all of that is one of the books that kind of captures\n\n1:58:07.540 --> 1:58:11.540\n something about Russian culture that people outside of Russia\n\n1:58:11.540 --> 1:58:15.540\n should probably read. I agree. What's the second one? So the second one\n\n1:58:15.540 --> 1:58:19.540\n is again another one that it happened\n\n1:58:19.540 --> 1:58:23.540\n I read it later in my life. I think I read it\n\n1:58:23.540 --> 1:58:27.540\n first time when I was a graduate student.\n\n1:58:27.540 --> 1:58:31.540\n And that's the Solzhenitsyn's Cancer Word.\n\n1:58:31.540 --> 1:58:35.540\n That is amazingly powerful book.\n\n1:58:35.540 --> 1:58:39.540\n What is it about? It's about, I mean, essentially\n\n1:58:39.540 --> 1:58:43.540\n based on Solzhenitsyn was\n\n1:58:43.540 --> 1:58:47.540\n diagnosed with cancer when he was reasonably young, and he\n\n1:58:47.540 --> 1:58:51.540\n made a full recovery. So this is\n\n1:58:51.540 --> 1:58:55.540\n about a person who was sentenced\n\n1:58:55.540 --> 1:58:59.540\n for life in one of these camps.\n\n1:58:59.540 --> 1:59:03.540\n And he had some cancer,\n\n1:59:03.540 --> 1:59:07.540\n so he was transported back to one of these\n\n1:59:07.540 --> 1:59:11.540\n Soviet republics, I think it was\n\n1:59:11.540 --> 1:59:15.540\n South Asian republics. And the\n\n1:59:15.540 --> 1:59:19.540\n book is about\n\n1:59:19.540 --> 1:59:23.540\n his experience being a\n\n1:59:23.540 --> 1:59:27.540\n prisoner, being a patient in the\n\n1:59:27.540 --> 1:59:31.540\n cancer clinic, in the cancer ward, surrounded\n\n1:59:31.540 --> 1:59:35.540\n by people, many of which die.\n\n1:59:35.540 --> 1:59:39.540\n But in the way\n\n1:59:39.540 --> 1:59:43.540\n it reads, first of all, later on I\n\n1:59:43.540 --> 1:59:47.540\n read the accounts of the doctors\n\n1:59:47.540 --> 1:59:51.540\n who describe the experiences\n\n1:59:51.540 --> 1:59:55.540\n in the book by the\n\n1:59:55.540 --> 1:59:59.540\n patient as incredibly accurate.\n\n1:59:59.540 --> 2:00:03.540\n So I read that there was some doctor saying that\n\n2:00:03.540 --> 2:00:07.540\n every single doctor should read this book to understand\n\n2:00:07.540 --> 2:00:11.540\n what the patient feels. But\n\n2:00:11.540 --> 2:00:15.540\n again, as many of the Solzhenitsyn's\n\n2:00:15.540 --> 2:00:19.540\n books, it has multiple levels of complexity.\n\n2:00:19.540 --> 2:00:23.540\n And obviously if you look above\n\n2:00:23.540 --> 2:00:27.540\n the cancer and the patient, the\n\n2:00:27.540 --> 2:00:31.540\n tumor that was growing and then disappeared\n\n2:00:31.540 --> 2:00:35.540\n in his\n\n2:00:35.540 --> 2:00:39.540\n body with some consequences, this is\n\n2:00:39.540 --> 2:00:43.540\n allegorically the\n\n2:00:43.540 --> 2:00:47.540\n Soviet, and he actually\n\n2:00:47.540 --> 2:00:51.540\n when he was asked, he said that this is what made him\n\n2:00:51.540 --> 2:00:55.540\n think about this, how to combine these experiences.\n\n2:00:55.540 --> 2:00:59.540\n Him being a part of the Soviet regime,\n\n2:00:59.540 --> 2:01:03.540\n also being a part of the\n\n2:01:03.540 --> 2:01:07.540\n someone sent to Gulag camp,\n\n2:01:07.540 --> 2:01:11.540\n and also someone who experienced cancer\n\n2:01:11.540 --> 2:01:15.540\n in his life. The Gulag Archipelago\n\n2:01:15.540 --> 2:01:19.540\n and this book, these are the works that actually made him\n\n2:01:19.540 --> 2:01:23.540\n receive a Nobel Prize. But to me\n\n2:01:23.540 --> 2:01:27.540\n I've read\n\n2:01:27.540 --> 2:01:31.540\n other books by Solzhenitsyn.\n\n2:01:31.540 --> 2:01:35.540\n This one to me is the most powerful one.\n\n2:01:35.540 --> 2:01:39.540\n And by the way, both this one and the previous one you read in Russian?\n\n2:01:39.540 --> 2:01:43.540\n Yes. So now there is the third book is an English book\n\n2:01:43.540 --> 2:01:47.540\n and it's completely different. So we're switching the gears\n\n2:01:47.540 --> 2:01:51.540\n completely. So this is the book which, it's not even\n\n2:01:51.540 --> 2:01:55.540\n a book, it's an essay by\n\n2:01:55.540 --> 2:01:59.540\n Jonathan Neumann called The Computer and the Brain.\n\n2:01:59.540 --> 2:02:03.540\n And that was the book he was writing\n\n2:02:03.540 --> 2:02:07.540\n knowing that he was dying of cancer.\n\n2:02:07.540 --> 2:02:11.540\n So the book was released back, it's a very thin book.\n\n2:02:11.540 --> 2:02:15.540\n But the power,\n\n2:02:15.540 --> 2:02:19.540\n the intellectual power in this book, in this essay\n\n2:02:19.540 --> 2:02:23.540\n is incredible. I mean you probably know that von Neumann\n\n2:02:23.540 --> 2:02:27.540\n is considered to be one of the biggest\n\n2:02:27.540 --> 2:02:31.540\n thinkers. So his intellectual power was incredible.\n\n2:02:31.540 --> 2:02:35.540\n And you can actually feel this power\n\n2:02:35.540 --> 2:02:39.540\n in this book where the person is writing knowing that he will be,\n\n2:02:39.540 --> 2:02:43.540\n he will die. The book actually got published only after his\n\n2:02:43.540 --> 2:02:47.540\n death back in 1958. He died in 1957.\n\n2:02:47.540 --> 2:02:51.540\n So he tried to put as many\n\n2:02:51.540 --> 2:02:55.540\n ideas that he still\n\n2:02:55.540 --> 2:02:59.540\n hadn't realized.\n\n2:02:59.540 --> 2:03:03.540\n So this book is very difficult\n\n2:03:03.540 --> 2:03:07.540\n to read because every single paragraph\n\n2:03:07.540 --> 2:03:11.540\n is just compact, is\n\n2:03:11.540 --> 2:03:15.540\n filled with these ideas. And the ideas are incredible.\n\n2:03:15.540 --> 2:03:19.540\n Even nowadays, so he tried\n\n2:03:19.540 --> 2:03:23.540\n to put the parallels between the brain\n\n2:03:23.540 --> 2:03:27.540\n computing power, the neural system, and the computers\n\n2:03:27.540 --> 2:03:31.540\n as they were understood. Do you remember what year he was working on this?\n\n2:03:31.540 --> 2:03:35.540\n 57. 57. So that was right during his,\n\n2:03:35.540 --> 2:03:39.540\n when he was diagnosed with cancer and he was essentially...\n\n2:03:39.540 --> 2:03:43.540\n Yeah, he's one of those, there's a few folks people mention,\n\n2:03:43.540 --> 2:03:47.540\n I think Ed Witten is another that like\n\n2:03:47.540 --> 2:03:51.540\n everyone that meets them, they say he's just an intellectual powerhouse.\n\n2:03:51.540 --> 2:03:55.540\n Yes. Okay, so who's the honorable mention?\n\n2:03:55.540 --> 2:03:59.540\n And this is, I mean, the reason I put it sort of in a separate section\n\n2:03:59.540 --> 2:04:03.540\n because this is a book that I recently\n\n2:04:03.540 --> 2:04:07.540\n listened to. So it's an audio book.\n\n2:04:07.540 --> 2:04:11.540\n And this is a book called Lab Girl by Hope Jarron.\n\n2:04:11.540 --> 2:04:15.540\n So Hope Jarron, she is a\n\n2:04:15.540 --> 2:04:19.540\n scientist, she's a geochemist that essentially\n\n2:04:19.540 --> 2:04:23.540\n studies the\n\n2:04:23.540 --> 2:04:27.540\n fossil plants. And so she uses\n\n2:04:27.540 --> 2:04:31.540\n this fossil plant, the chemical analysis to understand\n\n2:04:31.540 --> 2:04:35.540\n what was the climate back in\n\n2:04:35.540 --> 2:04:39.540\n a thousand years, hundreds of thousands of years ago.\n\n2:04:39.540 --> 2:04:43.540\n And so something that incredibly\n\n2:04:43.540 --> 2:04:47.540\n touched me by this book, it was narrated by the author.\n\n2:04:47.540 --> 2:04:51.540\n Nice. And it's an incredibly\n\n2:04:51.540 --> 2:04:55.540\n personal story, incredibly. So\n\n2:04:55.540 --> 2:04:59.540\n certain parts of the book, you could actually hear the author crying.\n\n2:04:59.540 --> 2:05:03.540\n And that to me, I mean, I never experienced\n\n2:05:03.540 --> 2:05:07.540\n anything like this, reading the book, but it was like\n\n2:05:07.540 --> 2:05:11.540\n the connection between you and the author.\n\n2:05:11.540 --> 2:05:15.540\n And I think this is really\n\n2:05:15.540 --> 2:05:19.540\n a must read, but even better, a must listen\n\n2:05:19.540 --> 2:05:23.540\n to audio book for anyone who\n\n2:05:23.540 --> 2:05:27.540\n wants to learn about sort of\n\n2:05:27.540 --> 2:05:31.540\n academia, science, research in general, because it's\n\n2:05:31.540 --> 2:05:35.540\n a very personal account about her becoming\n\n2:05:35.540 --> 2:05:39.540\n a scientist. So\n\n2:05:39.540 --> 2:05:43.540\n we're just before New Year's.\n\n2:05:43.540 --> 2:05:47.540\n We talked a lot about some difficult topics of viruses and so on.\n\n2:05:47.540 --> 2:05:51.540\n Do you have some exciting things you're looking forward\n\n2:05:51.540 --> 2:05:55.540\n to in 2021? Some New Year's resolutions,\n\n2:05:55.540 --> 2:05:59.540\n maybe silly or fun, or\n\n2:05:59.540 --> 2:06:03.540\n something very important and fundamental to\n\n2:06:03.540 --> 2:06:07.540\n the world of science or something completely unimportant?\n\n2:06:07.540 --> 2:06:11.540\n Well, I'm definitely looking forward to\n\n2:06:11.540 --> 2:06:15.540\n towards things becoming normal.\n\n2:06:15.540 --> 2:06:19.540\n So yes, I really miss traveling.\n\n2:06:19.540 --> 2:06:23.540\n Every summer I go\n\n2:06:23.540 --> 2:06:27.540\n to an international summer school. It's called\n\n2:06:27.540 --> 2:06:31.540\n the School for Molecular and Theoretical Biology. It's held in Europe.\n\n2:06:31.540 --> 2:06:35.540\n It's organized by very good friends of mine. And this is\n\n2:06:35.540 --> 2:06:39.540\n the school for gifted kids from all over the world, and\n\n2:06:39.540 --> 2:06:43.540\n they're incredibly bright. It's like every time I go there, it's like, you know,\n\n2:06:43.540 --> 2:06:47.540\n it's a highlight of the year. And\n\n2:06:47.540 --> 2:06:51.540\n we couldn't make it this August, so we\n\n2:06:51.540 --> 2:06:55.540\n did this school remotely, but it's different.\n\n2:06:55.540 --> 2:06:59.540\n So I am definitely looking forward to next August\n\n2:06:59.540 --> 2:07:03.540\n coming there. One of\n\n2:07:03.540 --> 2:07:07.540\n my personal resolutions, I realized that\n\n2:07:07.540 --> 2:07:11.540\n being in the house and working from home,\n\n2:07:11.540 --> 2:07:15.540\n I realized that actually\n\n2:07:15.540 --> 2:07:19.540\n I apparently missed a lot\n\n2:07:19.540 --> 2:07:23.540\n spending time with my family,\n\n2:07:23.540 --> 2:07:27.540\n believe it or not. So you typically, with all the\n\n2:07:27.540 --> 2:07:31.540\n research and teaching and\n\n2:07:31.540 --> 2:07:35.540\n everything related to the academic life,\n\n2:07:35.540 --> 2:07:39.540\n I mean, you get distracted. And so\n\n2:07:39.540 --> 2:07:43.540\n you don't feel that\n\n2:07:43.540 --> 2:07:47.540\n the fact that you are away from your family doesn't affect you\n\n2:07:47.540 --> 2:07:51.540\n because you are naturally distracted by other things.\n\n2:07:51.540 --> 2:07:55.540\n So this time I realized that\n\n2:07:55.540 --> 2:07:59.540\n that's so important, right? Spending your time with\n\n2:07:59.540 --> 2:08:03.540\n the family, with your kids. And so that\n\n2:08:03.540 --> 2:08:07.540\n would be my new year resolution and actually trying to\n\n2:08:07.540 --> 2:08:11.540\n spend as much time as possible. Even when the world opens up.\n\n2:08:11.540 --> 2:08:15.540\n Yeah, that's a beautiful message. That's a beautiful reminder.\n\n2:08:15.540 --> 2:08:19.540\n I asked you if there's a Russian poem\n\n2:08:19.540 --> 2:08:23.540\n that I could read, that I could force you to read, and you said, okay, fine, sure.\n\n2:08:23.540 --> 2:08:27.540\n Do you mind reading?\n\n2:08:27.540 --> 2:08:31.540\n And you said that no paper needed.\n\n2:08:31.540 --> 2:08:35.540\n So this poem was written by my namesake,\n\n2:08:35.540 --> 2:08:39.540\n another Dmitry, Dmitry Kemerefeld.\n\n2:08:39.540 --> 2:08:43.540\n It's a recent poem and it's\n\n2:08:43.540 --> 2:08:47.540\n called Sorceress, Vyadma,\n\n2:08:47.540 --> 2:08:51.540\n in Russian, or actually\n\n2:08:51.540 --> 2:08:55.540\n Koldunya. So that's sort of another sort of connotation of\n\n2:08:55.540 --> 2:08:59.540\n sorceress or witch. And I really like it\n\n2:08:59.540 --> 2:09:03.540\n and it's one of just a handful poems I actually\n\n2:09:03.540 --> 2:09:07.540\n can recall by heart. I also have a very strong\n\n2:09:07.540 --> 2:09:11.540\n association when I read this poem with Master and\n\n2:09:11.540 --> 2:09:15.540\n Margarita, the main female character,\n\n2:09:15.540 --> 2:09:19.540\n Margarita. And also it's\n\n2:09:19.540 --> 2:09:23.540\n about, it's happening about the same time we're talking\n\n2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:27.540\n now, so around New Year,\n\n2:09:27.540 --> 2:09:31.540\n around Christmas. Do you mind reading it in Russian?\n\n2:09:31.540 --> 2:09:49.540\n I'll give it a try.\n\n2:10:01.540 --> 2:10:05.540\n So you narrowed your eyes,\n\n2:10:05.540 --> 2:10:09.540\n that anyone who was blessed\n\n2:10:09.540 --> 2:10:13.540\n was ready to give their soul to the devil\n\n2:10:13.540 --> 2:10:17.540\n for this witch's connection.\n\n2:10:17.540 --> 2:10:21.540\n And I, without prejudice,\n\n2:10:21.540 --> 2:10:25.540\n ran out to feel your\n\n2:10:25.540 --> 2:10:29.540\n amazing breath on your lips,\n\n2:10:29.540 --> 2:10:33.540\n to remember how you flew above the earth\n\n2:10:33.540 --> 2:10:37.540\n in a white view,\n\n2:10:37.540 --> 2:10:41.540\n in a white haze, in a white mist.\n\n2:10:41.540 --> 2:10:45.540\n That's beautiful. I love how it captures a moment of longing\n\n2:10:45.540 --> 2:10:49.540\n and maybe love even.\n\n2:10:49.540 --> 2:10:53.540\n Yes. To me it has a lot of meaning about\n\n2:10:53.540 --> 2:10:57.540\n this something that is happening,\n\n2:10:57.540 --> 2:11:01.540\n something that is far away, but still very close to you.\n\n2:11:01.540 --> 2:11:05.540\n And yes, it's the winter.\n\n2:11:05.540 --> 2:11:09.540\n There's something magical about winter, isn't there?\n\n2:11:09.540 --> 2:11:13.540\n I don't know how to translate it, but a kiss in winter\n\n2:11:13.540 --> 2:11:17.540\n is interesting. Lips in winter and all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:11:17.540 --> 2:11:21.540\n It's beautiful. Russian has a way. It has a reason, Russian poetry\n\n2:11:21.540 --> 2:11:25.540\n is just, I'm a fan of poetry in both languages, but English\n\n2:11:25.540 --> 2:11:29.540\n doesn't capture some of the magic that Russian seems to, so\n\n2:11:29.540 --> 2:11:33.540\n thank you for doing that. That was awesome. Dmitry,\n\n2:11:33.540 --> 2:11:37.540\n it's great to talk to you again.
