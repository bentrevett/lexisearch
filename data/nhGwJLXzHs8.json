author of Losing the Nobel Prize\n\n00:07.760 --> 00:10.280\n and Into the Impossible.\n\n00:10.280 --> 00:13.680\n Plus, he's a host of the amazing podcast of the same name\n\n00:13.680 --> 00:16.880\n called Into the Impossible.\n\n00:16.880 --> 00:18.880\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:18.880 --> 00:21.020\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:21.020 --> 00:22.160\n in the description.\n\n00:22.160 --> 00:25.980\n And now, here's my conversation with Brian Keating.\n\n00:27.320 --> 00:29.560\n As an experimental physicist,\n\n00:29.560 --> 00:31.360\n what do you think is the most amazing\n\n00:31.360 --> 00:34.660\n or maybe the coolest measurement device\n\n00:34.660 --> 00:37.880\n you've ever worked with or humans have ever built?\n\n00:37.880 --> 00:41.560\n Maybe for now, let's exclude the background imaging\n\n00:41.560 --> 00:45.240\n of cosmic extragalactic polarization instruments.\n\n00:45.240 --> 00:46.320\n Yeah, I'm slightly biased\n\n00:46.320 --> 00:48.000\n towards that particular instrument.\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:49.640\n Talk about that in a little bit.\n\n00:49.640 --> 00:51.560\n But certainly the telescope, to me,\n\n00:51.560 --> 00:55.800\n is a lever that has literally moved the Earth\n\n00:55.800 --> 00:56.720\n throughout history.\n\n00:56.720 --> 00:58.000\n So the OG telescope?\n\n00:58.000 --> 00:59.060\n The OG telescope, yeah.\n\n00:59.060 --> 01:02.040\n The one invented not by Galileo, as most people think,\n\n01:02.040 --> 01:05.900\n but by this guy Hans Lippershey in the Netherlands.\n\n01:05.900 --> 01:07.680\n And it was kind of interesting\n\n01:07.680 --> 01:12.400\n because in the 1600s, 14, 1500, 1600s,\n\n01:12.400 --> 01:14.400\n there was the beginning of movable type.\n\n01:14.400 --> 01:17.200\n And so people, for the first time in history,\n\n01:17.200 --> 01:21.040\n had a standard by which they could appraise their eyesight.\n\n01:21.040 --> 01:22.480\n So looking at a printed word now,\n\n01:22.480 --> 01:24.920\n we just take it for granted, 12 point font, whatever,\n\n01:24.920 --> 01:26.400\n and that's what the eye charts are based on.\n\n01:26.400 --> 01:27.240\n They're just fixed height.\n\n01:27.240 --> 01:30.240\n But back then, there was no way to adjust your eyesight\n\n01:30.240 --> 01:32.720\n if you didn't have perfect vision.\n\n01:32.720 --> 01:35.040\n And there was no way to even tell if you had perfect vision\n\n01:35.040 --> 01:39.000\n or not until the Gutenberg Bible and movable type.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:40.360\n And at that time, people realized,\n\n01:40.360 --> 01:41.680\n hey, wait, I can't read this.\n\n01:41.680 --> 01:43.800\n My priest or my friend over here, he can read it,\n\n01:43.800 --> 01:44.680\n she can read it.\n\n01:44.680 --> 01:45.520\n I can't read it.\n\n01:45.520 --> 01:46.420\n What's going on?\n\n01:46.420 --> 01:50.680\n And that's when these people in Venice and in the Netherlands\n\n01:50.680 --> 01:53.320\n saw that they could take this kind of glass material\n\n01:53.320 --> 01:55.200\n and hold it up and maybe put another piece\n\n01:55.200 --> 01:57.560\n of glass material and it would make it clearer.\n\n01:57.560 --> 01:59.560\n And what was so interesting is that nobody thought\n\n01:59.560 --> 02:02.640\n to take that exact same device, two lenses,\n\n02:02.640 --> 02:04.680\n and go like, hmm, let me go like this\n\n02:04.680 --> 02:07.180\n and look at that bright thing in the sky over there,\n\n02:07.180 --> 02:08.440\n until Galileo.\n\n02:08.440 --> 02:10.180\n So Galileo didn't invent it,\n\n02:10.180 --> 02:12.480\n but he did something kind of amazing.\n\n02:12.480 --> 02:14.800\n He improved on it by a factor of 10.\n\n02:14.800 --> 02:17.040\n So he 10X'd it, which is almost as good\n\n02:17.040 --> 02:20.340\n as going from zero to one, as going from one to 10.\n\n02:20.340 --> 02:24.880\n And when he did that, he really transformed\n\n02:24.880 --> 02:28.480\n both how we look at the universe and think about it,\n\n02:28.480 --> 02:30.600\n but also who we are as a species,\n\n02:30.600 --> 02:34.240\n because we're using tools not to get food faster\n\n02:34.240 --> 02:39.240\n or to preserve our legacy for future generations,\n\n02:39.800 --> 02:43.700\n but actually to increase the benefit to the human mind.\n\n02:43.700 --> 02:46.540\n Somebody mentioned this idea that if humans\n\n02:46.540 --> 02:47.720\n weren't able to see the stars,\n\n02:47.720 --> 02:52.000\n maybe there was some kind of makeup of the atmosphere,\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:54.640\n which for the early humans made it impossible\n\n02:54.640 --> 02:56.960\n to see the stars, that we would never develop\n\n02:56.960 --> 02:59.400\n human civilization, or at least raising the question\n\n02:59.400 --> 03:02.120\n of how important is it to look up to the sky\n\n03:02.120 --> 03:04.660\n and wonder what's out there, as opposed to,\n\n03:05.680 --> 03:07.960\n maybe this is an over romanticized notion,\n\n03:07.960 --> 03:09.680\n but like looking at the ground,\n\n03:09.680 --> 03:12.760\n it feels like a little bit too much focused on survival,\n\n03:12.760 --> 03:15.360\n not being eaten by a bear slash lion.\n\n03:15.360 --> 03:17.360\n If you look up to the stars, you start to wonder\n\n03:17.360 --> 03:18.680\n what is my place in the universe?\n\n03:18.680 --> 03:21.640\n You think that's modern humans romanticizing?\n\n03:21.640 --> 03:25.720\n It's a little romantic, because they also took the same.\n\n03:25.720 --> 03:28.040\n They took the same two lenses and they looked inward.\n\n03:28.040 --> 03:30.280\n They looked at bacteria, they looked at hairs,\n\n03:30.280 --> 03:32.280\n and in other words, they made the microscope,\n\n03:32.280 --> 03:33.680\n and we're still doing that.\n\n03:33.680 --> 03:37.840\n And so to have a telescope, it serves a dual purpose.\n\n03:37.840 --> 03:41.840\n It's not only a way of looking out, it's looking in,\n\n03:41.840 --> 03:43.440\n but it's also looking back in time.\n\n03:43.440 --> 03:44.680\n In other words, you didn't see a microscope,\n\n03:44.680 --> 03:46.020\n you don't think, oh, I'm seeing this thing\n\n03:46.020 --> 03:47.780\n as it was one nanosecond ago,\n\n03:47.780 --> 03:49.960\n light travels one foot per nanosecond.\n\n03:49.960 --> 03:51.860\n I'm seeing it, no, you don't think about it like that.\n\n03:51.860 --> 03:54.320\n But when you see something that's happening on Jupiter,\n\n03:54.320 --> 03:56.800\n the moon, Andromeda galaxy, you're seeing things\n\n03:56.800 --> 04:00.040\n back when Lucy was walking around the Serengeti Plains.\n\n04:00.040 --> 04:03.360\n And for that, I think that took then the knowledge\n\n04:03.360 --> 04:06.840\n of relativity and time travel and so forth.\n\n04:06.840 --> 04:08.840\n It took that before we could really say,\n\n04:08.840 --> 04:12.200\n oh, we really unlocked some cheat codes in the human brain.\n\n04:12.200 --> 04:14.120\n So I think that might be a little too much,\n\n04:14.120 --> 04:15.800\n but nevertheless, I mean,\n\n04:15.800 --> 04:18.160\n what's better than having a time machine?\n\n04:18.160 --> 04:19.260\n We can look back in time,\n\n04:19.260 --> 04:21.640\n we see things as they were, not as they are.\n\n04:21.640 --> 04:23.200\n And that allows us to do many things,\n\n04:23.200 --> 04:24.680\n including speculate about that.\n\n04:24.680 --> 04:25.740\n But one of the coolest things,\n\n04:25.740 --> 04:26.580\n I don't know if you're familiar with,\n\n04:26.580 --> 04:27.920\n so I'm a radio astronomer.\n\n04:27.920 --> 04:30.280\n I don't actually look through telescopes very often,\n\n04:30.280 --> 04:33.960\n except on rare occasions when I take one out\n\n04:33.960 --> 04:37.800\n to show the kids, but a radio telescope\n\n04:37.800 --> 04:39.800\n is even more sort of visceral.\n\n04:39.800 --> 04:41.240\n I mean, it's much less cool because you look at it,\n\n04:41.240 --> 04:42.240\n you're like, all right, it looks cool,\n\n04:42.240 --> 04:43.760\n it's kind of weird shaped thing,\n\n04:43.760 --> 04:45.040\n looks like it belongs in sci fi,\n\n04:45.040 --> 04:48.120\n it's gonna blast the Death Star or whatever.\n\n04:48.120 --> 04:52.080\n But when you realize that when you point a radio telescope\n\n04:52.080 --> 04:53.560\n at a distant object,\n\n04:53.560 --> 04:55.960\n if that object fills up what's called the beam,\n\n04:55.960 --> 04:59.420\n which is basically the field of view of a radio telescope,\n\n04:59.420 --> 05:00.560\n it's called its beam.\n\n05:00.560 --> 05:03.600\n If you fill up the beam and you put a resistor,\n\n05:03.600 --> 05:05.800\n just a simple absorbing piece of material\n\n05:05.800 --> 05:07.760\n at the focus of the radio telescope,\n\n05:07.760 --> 05:11.200\n that resistor will come to the exact same temperature\n\n05:11.200 --> 05:13.960\n as the object that's looking at, which is pretty amazing.\n\n05:13.960 --> 05:16.160\n It means you're actually remotely measuring,\n\n05:16.160 --> 05:17.960\n you're taking the temperature of Jupiter\n\n05:17.960 --> 05:20.160\n or whatever in effect.\n\n05:20.160 --> 05:23.600\n And so it's allowing you to basically teleport\n\n05:23.600 --> 05:24.880\n and there's no other science\n\n05:24.880 --> 05:26.040\n that you can really do that, right?\n\n05:26.040 --> 05:27.320\n If you're an archeologist, you can't,\n\n05:27.320 --> 05:29.720\n let me get into my time machine\n\n05:29.720 --> 05:32.240\n and go back and see what was Lucy really like,\n\n05:32.240 --> 05:33.080\n it's not possible.\n\n05:33.080 --> 05:34.840\n So the same thing happens,\n\n05:34.840 --> 05:36.240\n this is where I've learned about this\n\n05:36.240 --> 05:37.320\n from March of the Penguins,\n\n05:37.320 --> 05:39.080\n when the penguins huddled together,\n\n05:40.720 --> 05:43.280\n the body temperature arrives to the same place.\n\n05:43.280 --> 05:45.320\n So you're doing this remotely,\n\n05:45.320 --> 05:46.880\n the March of the Penguins, but remote.\n\n05:46.880 --> 05:48.160\n We do it from Antarctica too,\n\n05:48.160 --> 05:50.480\n so there are some penguins around when we do it.\n\n05:50.480 --> 05:51.440\n Okay, excellent.\n\n05:51.440 --> 05:53.480\n You mentioned time machine,\n\n05:53.480 --> 05:57.080\n I think in your book, Losing the Nobel Prize,\n\n05:57.080 --> 05:59.680\n you talk about time machines.\n\n05:59.680 --> 06:01.440\n So let me ask you the question of,\n\n06:03.080 --> 06:04.520\n take us back in time,\n\n06:04.520 --> 06:07.480\n what happened at the beginning of our universe?\n\n06:07.480 --> 06:09.880\n Ah, okay, usually people preface this\n\n06:09.880 --> 06:11.200\n by saying I have a simple question.\n\n06:11.200 --> 06:15.200\n So what happened before the universe began, what happened?\n\n06:15.200 --> 06:17.520\n Brian Keating teaching me about comedy.\n\n06:18.400 --> 06:20.960\n I have a simple question for you, let's take two.\n\n06:20.960 --> 06:22.080\n I have a simple question,\n\n06:22.080 --> 06:23.800\n what happened at the beginning of our universe?\n\n06:23.800 --> 06:24.640\n There you go.\n\n06:24.640 --> 06:25.480\n All right, good.\n\n06:25.480 --> 06:28.160\n So when we think about what happened,\n\n06:28.160 --> 06:30.560\n it's more correct, it's more logical,\n\n06:30.560 --> 06:34.640\n it's more practical to go back in time starting from today.\n\n06:34.640 --> 06:39.640\n So if you go back 13.874 billion years from today,\n\n06:40.480 --> 06:41.640\n that's some day, right?\n\n06:41.640 --> 06:43.360\n I mean, you could translate into some day, right?\n\n06:43.360 --> 06:45.640\n So on that day, something happened.\n\n06:45.640 --> 06:49.120\n Earlier than the moment exactly now,\n\n06:49.120 --> 06:52.160\n let's say we're talking around one o clock.\n\n06:52.160 --> 06:54.480\n So at some point during that day,\n\n06:54.480 --> 06:57.200\n the universe started to become a fusion reactor.\n\n06:57.200 --> 07:00.120\n It started to fuse light elements and isotopes\n\n07:00.120 --> 07:01.680\n into heavier elements and isotopes\n\n07:01.680 --> 07:03.520\n of those heavier elements.\n\n07:03.520 --> 07:05.080\n After that period of time,\n\n07:05.080 --> 07:06.600\n going forward back closer to today,\n\n07:06.600 --> 07:09.680\n less 10 minutes earlier, 10 minutes earlier,\n\n07:09.680 --> 07:11.960\n or later rather coming towards us today,\n\n07:11.960 --> 07:14.400\n we know more and more about what the universe was like.\n\n07:14.400 --> 07:16.520\n And in fact, all the hydrogen,\n\n07:16.520 --> 07:19.080\n it's a very good approximation in the water molecules\n\n07:19.080 --> 07:21.400\n in this bottle, almost all of them were produced\n\n07:21.400 --> 07:23.680\n during that first 20 minute period.\n\n07:23.680 --> 07:27.800\n So I would say, the actual fusion and production\n\n07:27.800 --> 07:30.560\n of the lightest elements on the periodic table\n\n07:30.560 --> 07:33.360\n occurred in a time period shorter than the TV show,\n\n07:33.360 --> 07:34.400\n The Big Bang Theory.\n\n07:34.400 --> 07:35.240\n Well done, sir.\n\n07:35.240 --> 07:39.200\n You know, most of those light elements besides hydrogen\n\n07:39.200 --> 07:41.680\n aren't really used in your encounter, right?\n\n07:41.680 --> 07:43.680\n You don't encounter helium that often,\n\n07:43.680 --> 07:45.320\n unless you go to a lot of birthday parties\n\n07:45.320 --> 07:47.160\n or pilot a blimp.\n\n07:47.160 --> 07:49.360\n You don't need lithium, hopefully, you know,\n\n07:49.360 --> 07:50.240\n but other than that,\n\n07:50.240 --> 07:51.080\n those are the kinds of things\n\n07:51.080 --> 07:52.280\n that were produced during that moment.\n\n07:52.280 --> 07:54.280\n The question became, how did the heavier things\n\n07:54.280 --> 07:56.760\n like iron, carbon, nickel, we can get to that later.\n\n07:56.760 --> 07:59.720\n And I brought some samples for us to discuss\n\n07:59.720 --> 08:02.240\n and how those came from a very different type of process\n\n08:02.240 --> 08:04.600\n called a different type of fusion reactor\n\n08:04.600 --> 08:07.120\n and a different type of process explosion as well\n\n08:07.120 --> 08:08.520\n called a supernova.\n\n08:08.520 --> 08:11.480\n However, if you go back beyond those first three minutes,\n\n08:11.480 --> 08:13.880\n we really have to say almost nothing\n\n08:13.880 --> 08:15.880\n because we are not capable.\n\n08:15.880 --> 08:17.440\n In other words, going backwards\n\n08:17.440 --> 08:18.840\n from the first three minutes,\n\n08:18.840 --> 08:21.840\n as famous Steven Weinberg titled his book,\n\n08:21.840 --> 08:25.160\n we actually marks a point where ignorance takes over.\n\n08:25.160 --> 08:28.280\n In other words, we can't speculate on what happened\n\n08:28.280 --> 08:30.920\n three minutes before the preponderance of hydrogen\n\n08:30.920 --> 08:32.360\n was formed in our universe.\n\n08:32.360 --> 08:34.720\n We just don't know enough about that epoch.\n\n08:34.720 --> 08:36.280\n There are many people, most people,\n\n08:36.280 --> 08:38.800\n most practicing card carrying cosmologists\n\n08:38.800 --> 08:41.400\n believe the universe began in what's called the singularity.\n\n08:41.400 --> 08:44.000\n And we can certainly talk about that.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.480\n However, singularity is so far removed\n\n08:46.480 --> 08:49.160\n from anything we can ever hope to prove,\n\n08:49.160 --> 08:51.960\n hope to confront or hope to observe with evidence.\n\n08:51.960 --> 08:54.920\n And really only occurs in two instantiations,\n\n08:54.920 --> 08:57.000\n the big bang and the core of a black hole,\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:58.640\n neither of which is observable.\n\n08:58.640 --> 09:00.160\n And so for that reason,\n\n09:00.160 --> 09:02.880\n there are now flourishing alternatives that say,\n\n09:02.880 --> 09:05.280\n you can actually for the first time ask the question\n\n09:05.280 --> 09:10.280\n that day, Tuesday in the first moments of our universe,\n\n09:10.280 --> 09:12.800\n there was a Tuesday a week before that,\n\n09:12.800 --> 09:15.040\n 24 hours times seven days before that.\n\n09:15.960 --> 09:19.360\n That has a perfectly well understood meaning\n\n09:19.360 --> 09:23.640\n in models of cosmology promoted by some of the more eminent\n\n09:23.640 --> 09:25.440\n of cosmologists working today.\n\n09:25.440 --> 09:28.080\n When I was in grad school over 25 years ago,\n\n09:28.080 --> 09:30.600\n no one really considered anything besides that big bang\n\n09:30.600 --> 09:32.440\n that there was a singularity.\n\n09:32.440 --> 09:36.320\n And people would have to say, as I said, we just don't know.\n\n09:36.320 --> 09:38.760\n But they would say some future incarnation\n\n09:38.760 --> 09:40.800\n of some experiment will tell us the answer.\n\n09:40.800 --> 09:42.880\n But now there are people that are saying\n\n09:42.880 --> 09:45.360\n there is an alternative to the big bang.\n\n09:45.360 --> 09:46.960\n And it's not really fringe science\n\n09:46.960 --> 09:50.880\n as it once was 50, 80 years ago when these models...\n\n09:50.880 --> 09:53.760\n By the way, the first cosmology in history\n\n09:53.760 --> 09:55.720\n was not a singular universe.\n\n09:55.720 --> 09:59.280\n The first cosmology in history goes back to Akhenaten Ra\n\n09:59.280 --> 10:03.720\n and the temples of Egypt in the third millennium BC.\n\n10:03.720 --> 10:06.200\n And in that, they talked about cyclical universes.\n\n10:06.200 --> 10:09.200\n So I always joke, that guy Akhenaten's court,\n\n10:09.200 --> 10:11.560\n he'd have a pretty high H index right about now\n\n10:11.560 --> 10:14.360\n because people have been using that cyclical model\n\n10:14.360 --> 10:17.760\n from Penrose to Paul Steinhardt and Aegis\n\n10:17.760 --> 10:20.880\n and right up until this very moment.\n\n10:20.880 --> 10:25.120\n Can you maybe explore the possible alternatives\n\n10:25.120 --> 10:27.400\n to the big bang theory?\n\n10:27.400 --> 10:29.880\n So there are many alternatives starting with...\n\n10:29.880 --> 10:33.640\n So the singularity quantum cosmologically demanding\n\n10:33.640 --> 10:37.560\n singular origin of the universe, that stands in contrast\n\n10:37.560 --> 10:40.160\n to these other models in which time does not have\n\n10:40.160 --> 10:44.040\n a beginning and many of them feature cycles,\n\n10:44.040 --> 10:47.600\n at least one cycle, possibly infinite number of cycles,\n\n10:47.600 --> 10:48.880\n called by Sir Roger Penrose.\n\n10:48.880 --> 10:51.920\n And they all have things in common, these alternatives,\n\n10:51.920 --> 10:55.080\n as does the dominant paradigm of cosmogenesis,\n\n10:55.080 --> 10:56.200\n which is inflation.\n\n10:56.200 --> 11:00.120\n Inflation can be thought of as this spark\n\n11:00.120 --> 11:03.000\n that ignites the hot big bang that I said we understood.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:04.600\n So it's an earlier condition,\n\n11:04.600 --> 11:06.560\n but it's still not an initial condition.\n\n11:06.560 --> 11:09.640\n In physics, imagine I show you a grandfather clock\n\n11:09.640 --> 11:11.440\n or a pendulum swinging back and forth.\n\n11:11.440 --> 11:14.360\n You look away for a second, you come into the room,\n\n11:14.360 --> 11:15.440\n pendulum swinging back and forth.\n\n11:15.440 --> 11:17.360\n Alex, tell me, where did it start?\n\n11:17.360 --> 11:19.560\n How many cycles is it gonna make before the era?\n\n11:19.560 --> 11:20.800\n You can't answer that question\n\n11:20.800 --> 11:22.760\n without knowing the initial conditions.\n\n11:22.760 --> 11:25.080\n In a very simple system, like a one dimensional,\n\n11:25.080 --> 11:27.240\n simple harmonic oscillator, like a pendulum,\n\n11:27.240 --> 11:29.160\n think about understanding the whole universe\n\n11:29.160 --> 11:31.320\n without understanding the initial conditions.\n\n11:31.320 --> 11:34.920\n It's a tremendous lacuna, a gap that we have as scientists\n\n11:34.920 --> 11:39.280\n that we may not be able to, in the inflationary cosmology,\n\n11:39.280 --> 11:42.040\n determine the quantitative physical properties\n\n11:42.040 --> 11:43.800\n of the universe prior to what's called\n\n11:43.800 --> 11:45.120\n the inflationary epoch.\n\n11:45.120 --> 11:47.520\n So you're saying for the pendulum in that epoch,\n\n11:47.520 --> 11:50.960\n we can't, because you can infer things about the pendulum\n\n11:50.960 --> 11:54.320\n before you show up to the room in our current epoch,\n\n11:54.320 --> 11:55.160\n correct? Right.\n\n11:55.160 --> 11:56.680\n Yeah, so if you look at it right now,\n\n11:56.680 --> 11:58.560\n but if I said, well, when will it stop oscillating?\n\n11:58.560 --> 12:00.920\n So that depends on how much energy it got initially.\n\n12:00.920 --> 12:03.000\n And you can measure its dissipation, its air resistance,\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:03.840\n you had infrared camera,\n\n12:03.840 --> 12:05.400\n you could see it's getting hotter maybe,\n\n12:05.400 --> 12:07.120\n and you could do some calculations.\n\n12:07.120 --> 12:09.200\n But to know the two things in physics\n\n12:09.200 --> 12:10.840\n to solve a partial differential equation\n\n12:10.840 --> 12:12.920\n are the initial conditions and the boundary conditions.\n\n12:12.920 --> 12:14.000\n Boundary conditions, we're here on earth,\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.320\n it has gravitational field, it's not gonna excurs,\n\n12:16.320 --> 12:19.320\n or make excursions wildly beyond the length of the pendulum.\n\n12:19.320 --> 12:22.960\n It's not, it has simple properties.\n\n12:22.960 --> 12:25.200\n So, but this is like, in other words,\n\n12:25.200 --> 12:28.680\n you can't tell me when did the solar system start orbiting\n\n12:28.680 --> 12:29.960\n in the way that it does now.\n\n12:29.960 --> 12:31.400\n In other words, when did the moon acquire\n\n12:31.400 --> 12:33.560\n the exact angular momentum that it has now?\n\n12:34.720 --> 12:36.320\n Now, that's a pretty pedestrian example.\n\n12:36.320 --> 12:40.040\n But what I'm telling you is that the inflationary epoch\n\n12:40.040 --> 12:43.080\n purports and is successful at providing\n\n12:43.080 --> 12:46.200\n a lot of explanations for how the universe evolved\n\n12:46.200 --> 12:48.520\n after inflation took place and ended,\n\n12:48.520 --> 12:52.040\n but it says nothing about how it itself took place.\n\n12:52.040 --> 12:53.680\n And that's really what you're asking me.\n\n12:53.680 --> 12:55.240\n I mean, you don't really, look,\n\n12:55.240 --> 12:57.800\n what you care about like big bang nucleosynthesis\n\n12:57.800 --> 13:00.120\n and the elements got made and these fusion reactors\n\n13:00.120 --> 13:02.040\n and the whole universe was a fusion reactor,\n\n13:02.040 --> 13:04.760\n but like, don't you really care about what happened\n\n13:04.760 --> 13:08.440\n at the beginning of time, at the first moment of time?\n\n13:08.440 --> 13:11.160\n And the problem is we can't really answer that\n\n13:11.160 --> 13:12.960\n in the context of the big bang.\n\n13:12.960 --> 13:15.760\n We can answer that in the context of these alternatives.\n\n13:15.760 --> 13:16.960\n So you asked me about some of the alternatives.\n\n13:16.960 --> 13:18.120\n So one is Aon theory,\n\n13:18.120 --> 13:21.040\n the conformal cyclic cosmology of Sir Roger Penrose.\n\n13:21.040 --> 13:25.320\n Another one that was really popular in the 60s and 70s\n\n13:25.320 --> 13:28.080\n until the discovery of the primary component\n\n13:28.080 --> 13:29.000\n of my research field,\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:31.360\n the cosmic microwave background radiation or CMB,\n\n13:31.360 --> 13:33.200\n the three Kelvin all pervasive signal\n\n13:33.200 --> 13:36.360\n that astronomers detected in 1965.\n\n13:36.360 --> 13:39.240\n That kind of spelled the death knell in some sense\n\n13:39.240 --> 13:42.160\n to what was called the quasi steady state universe.\n\n13:43.560 --> 13:47.640\n And then there was another model\n\n13:47.640 --> 13:49.200\n that kind of came out of that.\n\n13:49.200 --> 13:51.720\n You hear the word quasi, so it's not steady state.\n\n13:51.720 --> 13:53.200\n Steady state means always existed.\n\n13:53.200 --> 13:55.680\n That was a cosmology Einstein believed until Hubble\n\n13:55.680 --> 13:58.960\n showed him evidence for the expansion of the universe.\n\n13:58.960 --> 14:02.480\n And most scientists believed in that for millennia basically.\n\n14:02.480 --> 14:05.560\n The universe was eternal, static, unchanging.\n\n14:05.560 --> 14:07.040\n They couldn't believe that after Hubble.\n\n14:07.040 --> 14:09.480\n So they had to append onto it,\n\n14:09.480 --> 14:12.920\n concatenate this new feature that it wasn't steady,\n\n14:12.920 --> 14:14.400\n it was quasi steady.\n\n14:14.400 --> 14:16.840\n So the universe was making a certain amount of hydrogen\n\n14:16.840 --> 14:19.640\n every century in a given volume of space.\n\n14:19.640 --> 14:22.880\n And that amount of hydrogen that was produced was constant.\n\n14:22.880 --> 14:25.080\n But because it was producing more and more every century,\n\n14:25.080 --> 14:27.000\n as centuries pile up and the volume piles up,\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:28.320\n the universe could expand.\n\n14:28.320 --> 14:29.760\n And so that's how they developed it.\n\n14:29.760 --> 14:30.600\n That's slowly.\n\n14:30.600 --> 14:31.440\n Very slowly.\n\n14:31.440 --> 14:33.440\n And it doesn't match observational evidence.\n\n14:33.440 --> 14:35.160\n But that is an alternative.\n\n14:35.160 --> 14:36.200\n By the way, did Einstein think\n\n14:36.200 --> 14:39.360\n the steady state universe is infinite or finite?\n\n14:39.360 --> 14:40.200\n Do you know?\n\n14:41.320 --> 14:43.440\n I would assume that he thought it was infinite\n\n14:43.440 --> 14:45.320\n because there was really,\n\n14:45.320 --> 14:48.240\n if something had a no beginning in time,\n\n14:48.240 --> 14:50.680\n then it would be very unlikely we're in the center of it\n\n14:50.680 --> 14:54.000\n or it's bounded or it has, in that case, a finite edge to it.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\n I wonder what he thought about infinity\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.280\n because that's such an uncomfortable.\n\n14:57.280 --> 14:58.520\n Yeah, it's a silly joke.\n\n14:58.520 --> 15:00.720\n I'm sure you're familiar with this silly joke, right?\n\n15:00.720 --> 15:02.880\n The silly joke was that there are only two things\n\n15:02.880 --> 15:06.600\n that are infinite, the universe and human stupidity,\n\n15:06.600 --> 15:08.560\n and I'm not sure about the universe.\n\n15:08.560 --> 15:10.880\n Well, me saying I'm not aware of the joke\n\n15:10.880 --> 15:12.800\n is a good example of the joke.\n\n15:12.800 --> 15:14.080\n It's very meta.\n\n15:14.080 --> 15:16.520\n Okay, so, all right, sorry.\n\n15:16.520 --> 15:17.840\n You were saying about quasi.\n\n15:17.840 --> 15:18.680\n All the alternatives.\n\n15:18.680 --> 15:20.920\n All the alternatives in the quasi steady state.\n\n15:20.920 --> 15:22.800\n And the most kind of promising,\n\n15:22.800 --> 15:24.320\n although I hate to say that,\n\n15:24.320 --> 15:27.120\n people say, well, that's your favorite alternative, right?\n\n15:27.120 --> 15:29.480\n This is not investment advice.\n\n15:29.480 --> 15:31.880\n Inflation is not transitory.\n\n15:31.880 --> 15:33.480\n It is quasi permanent.\n\n15:34.440 --> 15:35.760\n So, a very prominent.\n\n15:35.760 --> 15:36.600\n Sorry to interrupt.\n\n15:36.600 --> 15:38.200\n We're talking about cosmic inflation,\n\n15:38.200 --> 15:40.280\n so calm down, cryptocurrency folks.\n\n15:40.280 --> 15:41.120\n That's right.\n\n15:41.120 --> 15:43.080\n Although the first Nobel Prize,\n\n15:43.080 --> 15:45.160\n and one of the first Nobel Prizes in economics\n\n15:45.160 --> 15:48.360\n was awarded for inflation, not of the cosmological kind.\n\n15:48.360 --> 15:49.200\n So, most people don't know\n\n15:49.200 --> 15:50.520\n that inflation has already won a Nobel Prize.\n\n15:50.520 --> 15:53.120\n It's a good topic to work on if you won a Nobel Prize.\n\n15:54.160 --> 15:55.080\n Doesn't matter the field.\n\n15:55.080 --> 15:57.320\n Exactly, it's time translation invariant.\n\n15:57.320 --> 15:59.920\n So, when we look at the alternative\n\n15:59.920 --> 16:03.080\n that's called the bouncing or cyclic cosmologies,\n\n16:03.080 --> 16:07.840\n these have serious virtues, according to some.\n\n16:07.840 --> 16:10.040\n One of the virtues to me, just as a human,\n\n16:10.040 --> 16:11.960\n I'm just speaking as a human,\n\n16:12.880 --> 16:15.640\n one of the founders of the new version\n\n16:15.640 --> 16:20.640\n of the cyclic cosmology called the bouncing cosmology\n\n16:21.320 --> 16:22.520\n is Paul Steinhardt.\n\n16:22.520 --> 16:24.760\n He's the Einstein Professor of Natural Sciences\n\n16:24.760 --> 16:25.760\n at Princeton University.\n\n16:25.760 --> 16:27.000\n You may have heard of it.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.560\n And he was one of the originators\n\n16:29.560 --> 16:32.280\n of what was called new inflation.\n\n16:32.280 --> 16:34.400\n In other words, he was one of the founding fathers\n\n16:34.400 --> 16:38.560\n of inflation, who now not only has no belief\n\n16:38.560 --> 16:40.000\n or support for inflation,\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:45.000\n he actively claims that inflation is baroque, pernicious,\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:48.040\n dangerous, malevolent, not to science,\n\n16:48.040 --> 16:50.840\n not just to cosmology, but to society.\n\n16:50.840 --> 16:53.320\n So, here's a man who created a theory\n\n16:53.320 --> 16:56.200\n that's captivated the world or universe of cosmologists,\n\n16:56.200 --> 16:57.040\n such as it is.\n\n16:57.040 --> 16:57.920\n It's not a huge universe,\n\n16:57.920 --> 17:00.840\n but there are more podcasters than cosmologists.\n\n17:00.840 --> 17:01.680\n Some do both.\n\n17:01.680 --> 17:06.680\n But this man created this theory with collaborators.\n\n17:06.760 --> 17:10.520\n And now he's like, I'm like, Paul, you're denying paternity.\n\n17:10.520 --> 17:11.960\n You're like a deadbeat dad.\n\n17:11.960 --> 17:14.960\n Now you're saying like, inflation is bogus.\n\n17:14.960 --> 17:17.360\n But he doesn't just attack.\n\n17:17.360 --> 17:18.680\n See, this is what's very important\n\n17:18.680 --> 17:21.560\n about approaching things as an experimentalist.\n\n17:21.560 --> 17:23.560\n You got a lot of theorists on, and that's wonderful.\n\n17:23.560 --> 17:25.200\n And I think that's a huge service.\n\n17:25.200 --> 17:27.800\n An experimentalist has to say no.\n\n17:27.800 --> 17:30.440\n He or she has to be confident to say like,\n\n17:30.440 --> 17:32.840\n I don't care if I prove you right\n\n17:32.840 --> 17:35.320\n or I prove your enemy wrong or whatever.\n\n17:35.320 --> 17:37.120\n We have to be like exterminators.\n\n17:37.120 --> 17:38.640\n And nobody likes the exterminator\n\n17:38.640 --> 17:39.560\n until they need one, right?\n\n17:39.560 --> 17:41.400\n Or the garbage collectors, right?\n\n17:41.400 --> 17:45.760\n But it's vital that we be completely kind of unpersuaded\n\n17:45.760 --> 17:48.840\n by the beauty and the magnificence and the symmetry\n\n17:48.840 --> 17:50.120\n and the simplicity of some idea.\n\n17:50.120 --> 17:52.440\n Like inflation is a beautiful idea,\n\n17:52.440 --> 17:54.000\n but it also has consequences.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:55.000\n And what Paul claims,\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.320\n I don't agree with him fully on this point,\n\n17:57.320 --> 17:59.160\n is that those consequences are dangerous\n\n17:59.160 --> 18:01.400\n because they lead to things like the multiverse,\n\n18:01.400 --> 18:03.720\n which is outside the purview of science.\n\n18:03.720 --> 18:07.240\n And in that sense, I can see support for what he does,\n\n18:07.240 --> 18:09.840\n but none of that detracts from my respect for a man.\n\n18:09.840 --> 18:11.800\n You know, imagine like, you know,\n\n18:11.800 --> 18:14.440\n Elon comes up with this like really great idea,\n\n18:14.440 --> 18:15.520\n you know, space, and then he's like,\n\n18:15.520 --> 18:18.160\n oh, actually it's not gonna work.\n\n18:18.160 --> 18:19.400\n But like, here's this better idea.\n\n18:19.400 --> 18:21.040\n And he's like, SpaceX is not gonna work,\n\n18:21.040 --> 18:23.280\n but he's now creating an alternative to it.\n\n18:23.280 --> 18:25.920\n It's extremely hard to do what Paul has done.\n\n18:25.920 --> 18:27.080\n Doesn't mean he's right.\n\n18:27.080 --> 18:29.240\n Doesn't mean I'm gonna like have more\n\n18:29.240 --> 18:32.000\n and more attention paid to it because he's my friend\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.360\n or because I respect the idea\n\n18:33.360 --> 18:35.960\n or I respect the man and his colleague,\n\n18:35.960 --> 18:38.440\n Anna Aegis, who works really hard with him.\n\n18:38.440 --> 18:41.560\n But nevertheless, this has certain attractions to it.\n\n18:41.560 --> 18:45.640\n And what it does most foremost is that it removes\n\n18:45.640 --> 18:49.280\n the quantum gravity aspect from cosmology.\n\n18:49.280 --> 18:52.160\n So it takes away 50% of the motivation\n\n18:52.160 --> 18:54.320\n for a theory of quantum gravity.\n\n18:54.320 --> 18:56.600\n You've talked a lot about quantum gravity.\n\n18:56.600 --> 18:58.880\n You talk to people, eminent people on the show.\n\n18:58.880 --> 19:00.960\n Always latent in those conversations\n\n19:00.960 --> 19:03.640\n is sort of the teleological expectation\n\n19:03.640 --> 19:06.160\n that there is a theory of everything.\n\n19:06.160 --> 19:08.760\n There is a theory of quantum gravity.\n\n19:08.760 --> 19:10.560\n But there's no law that says\n\n19:10.560 --> 19:12.800\n we have to have a theory of quantum gravity.\n\n19:12.800 --> 19:16.280\n So that kind of implicit expectation\n\n19:16.280 --> 19:19.480\n has to do ultimately with the inflationary theory.\n\n19:19.480 --> 19:23.360\n So in cosmic inflation, so is that at the core?\n\n19:23.360 --> 19:28.000\n So okay, maybe you can speak to what is the negative impacts\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:33.000\n on society from believing in cosmic inflation.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:37.280\n So one of the more kind of robust predictions of inflation,\n\n19:37.280 --> 19:39.720\n according to its other two patriarchs,\n\n19:39.720 --> 19:41.800\n considered to be its patriarchs, Alan Guth at MIT\n\n19:41.800 --> 19:44.080\n and Andrei Linde at Stanford,\n\n19:44.080 --> 19:48.080\n although he was in the USSR when he came up with these ideas,\n\n19:48.080 --> 19:51.200\n along with Paul Steinhardt, was that the universe\n\n19:51.200 --> 19:55.160\n has to eventually get into a quantum state,\n\n19:55.160 --> 19:57.040\n has to exist in this Hilbert space,\n\n19:57.040 --> 19:58.840\n and the Hilbert space has certain features,\n\n19:58.840 --> 20:00.320\n and those features are quantum mechanical,\n\n20:00.320 --> 20:02.920\n endowed with quantum mechanical properties.\n\n20:02.920 --> 20:07.400\n And then it becomes very difficult to turn inflation off.\n\n20:07.400 --> 20:09.120\n So inflation can get started,\n\n20:09.120 --> 20:11.960\n but then it's like one of, you know, SpaceX rockets.\n\n20:11.960 --> 20:14.400\n It's hard to turn off a solid rocket booster, right?\n\n20:14.400 --> 20:16.240\n It continues the thrusting.\n\n20:16.240 --> 20:19.040\n You need another mechanism to douse the flames\n\n20:19.040 --> 20:21.240\n of the inflationary expansion,\n\n20:21.240 --> 20:24.200\n which means that if inflation kicks off somewhere,\n\n20:24.200 --> 20:27.640\n it will kick off potentially everywhere at all times,\n\n20:27.640 --> 20:32.440\n including now, spawning an ever increasing set of universes.\n\n20:32.440 --> 20:35.920\n Some will die stillborn, some will continue and flourish,\n\n20:35.920 --> 20:38.800\n and this is known as the multiverse paradigm.\n\n20:38.800 --> 20:41.000\n It's a robust, seemingly robust consequence,\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:43.480\n not only of inflationary cosmology,\n\n20:43.480 --> 20:44.560\n but more and more, we're seeing it\n\n20:44.560 --> 20:45.560\n in string theory as well.\n\n20:45.560 --> 20:48.200\n So that, you know, sometimes two, you know,\n\n20:48.200 --> 20:49.600\n branches coming to the same conclusion\n\n20:49.600 --> 20:52.320\n is, you know, taken as evidence for its reality.\n\n20:52.320 --> 20:54.240\n So one of the negative consequences\n\n20:54.240 --> 20:57.600\n is it creates phenomena that we can't,\n\n20:57.600 --> 21:01.680\n that are outside the reach of experimental science,\n\n21:01.680 --> 21:04.120\n or is it that the multiverse somehow\n\n21:04.120 --> 21:07.520\n has a philosophical negative effect on humanity?\n\n21:07.520 --> 21:08.760\n Like it makes us,\n\n21:10.880 --> 21:13.200\n maybe it makes life seem more meaningless?\n\n21:13.200 --> 21:15.960\n Is that where he's getting at a little bit,\n\n21:15.960 --> 21:18.080\n or is it not reaching that far?\n\n21:18.080 --> 21:20.920\n Well, no, I think those are both kind of perceptive.\n\n21:21.920 --> 21:23.000\n The answer is a little of both,\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:26.600\n because in one sense, it's meant kind of to explain\n\n21:26.600 --> 21:28.160\n this fine tuning problem,\n\n21:28.160 --> 21:29.880\n that we find ourselves in a universe\n\n21:29.880 --> 21:32.720\n that's particularly facund, that has features,\n\n21:32.720 --> 21:34.800\n you know, consistent with our existence,\n\n21:34.800 --> 21:36.240\n and how could we be otherwise?\n\n21:36.240 --> 21:39.000\n You know, this sort of weak anthropic principle.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:42.520\n On the other hand, a theory that predicts everything,\n\n21:42.520 --> 21:46.000\n literally everything, can be said to predict nothing.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.320\n Like if I say, Lex, you know, you've been working out,\n\n21:48.320 --> 21:50.360\n you look like, you know, yeah, you haven't,\n\n21:50.360 --> 21:51.200\n yeah, that's great.\n\n21:51.200 --> 21:52.160\n You look like you're, you know,\n\n21:52.160 --> 21:54.840\n about somewhere under 10,000 kilograms.\n\n21:54.840 --> 21:56.520\n Like, all right, yeah, you're right,\n\n21:56.520 --> 21:57.840\n but that's horribly imprecise.\n\n21:57.840 --> 21:58.960\n So what good is that?\n\n21:58.960 --> 21:59.780\n That's meaningless.\n\n21:59.780 --> 22:01.640\n You don't contribute any what's called surprise,\n\n22:01.640 --> 22:03.160\n or reduction in entropy,\n\n22:03.160 --> 22:06.160\n or reduction of your ignorance about the system,\n\n22:06.160 --> 22:08.360\n or you know exactly how much you weigh.\n\n22:08.360 --> 22:10.300\n So me telling you that tells you nothing.\n\n22:10.300 --> 22:11.920\n In this case, it's basically saying\n\n22:11.920 --> 22:13.220\n that we're living in a universe\n\n22:13.220 --> 22:16.200\n because the overwhelming odds of our existence\n\n22:17.160 --> 22:18.960\n dictate that we would exist.\n\n22:18.960 --> 22:20.720\n There has to be at least one place that we exist.\n\n22:20.720 --> 22:24.120\n But the problem is it's a manifestation of infinity.\n\n22:24.120 --> 22:26.640\n So humans, and I'm sure you know this\n\n22:26.640 --> 22:29.980\n from your work with AI and ML and everything else,\n\n22:30.880 --> 22:33.600\n that humans, as far as we know,\n\n22:33.600 --> 22:36.160\n really are the only entities capable\n\n22:36.160 --> 22:38.360\n of contemplating infinity,\n\n22:38.360 --> 22:40.680\n but we do so very imperfectly, right?\n\n22:40.680 --> 22:42.320\n So if I say to you, like, what's bigger,\n\n22:42.320 --> 22:45.220\n the number of, you know, water molecules in this thing,\n\n22:45.220 --> 22:46.760\n or the number of real numbers?\n\n22:46.760 --> 22:47.580\n Or if I say, what's bigger,\n\n22:47.580 --> 22:49.280\n the number of real numbers or rational numbers?\n\n22:49.280 --> 22:50.800\n They're all different classifications\n\n22:50.800 --> 22:53.240\n of the amount of infinities that there could be.\n\n22:53.240 --> 22:54.600\n Infinity to the infinity power.\n\n22:54.600 --> 22:55.500\n You know, when you have kids someday,\n\n22:55.500 --> 22:56.960\n they'll tell you, I love you, infinity.\n\n22:56.960 --> 22:59.400\n You have to come back, I love you, infinity plus one, right?\n\n22:59.400 --> 23:03.360\n So, but the human brain can't really contemplate infinity.\n\n23:03.360 --> 23:05.160\n Let me illustrate that.\n\n23:05.160 --> 23:06.840\n They say in the singularity,\n\n23:06.840 --> 23:10.720\n the universe had an infinite temperature, right?\n\n23:10.720 --> 23:12.480\n So let me ask you a question.\n\n23:12.480 --> 23:14.480\n Is there anything that you can contemplate\n\n23:14.480 --> 23:17.680\n in the, you know, Einstein's little quip aside,\n\n23:17.680 --> 23:20.200\n that's infinite, like a physical property,\n\n23:20.200 --> 23:24.880\n density, pressure, temperature, energy, that's infinite.\n\n23:24.880 --> 23:27.520\n And if you can think of such thing, I'd like to know it.\n\n23:27.520 --> 23:30.600\n But if you can, how does it go to infinity minus one?\n\n23:30.600 --> 23:32.920\n You know, the opposite direction I go with my kids.\n\n23:32.920 --> 23:34.560\n How does it go from like to half of infinity?\n\n23:34.560 --> 23:35.700\n Because that's still infinity.\n\n23:35.700 --> 23:36.920\n How did it cool down?\n\n23:36.920 --> 23:39.460\n How did it get more and more tenuous and rarefied?\n\n23:39.460 --> 23:41.600\n So now it's only infinity over two,\n\n23:41.600 --> 23:42.440\n in terms of pascals.\n\n23:42.440 --> 23:44.600\n Less infinite to more infinite.\n\n23:44.600 --> 23:46.400\n Yeah, I mean, it's,\n\n23:46.400 --> 23:49.680\n that's one of the biggest troubling things to me\n\n23:49.680 --> 23:53.800\n about infinity is you can't truly hold it inside our minds.\n\n23:53.800 --> 23:55.800\n It's a mathematical construct that doesn't,\n\n23:55.800 --> 23:57.840\n it feels like intuition fails.\n\n23:57.840 --> 23:59.960\n But nevertheless, we use it nonchalantly\n\n23:59.960 --> 24:02.720\n and then use, like physicists,\n\n24:02.720 --> 24:05.440\n they're incredible intuition machines.\n\n24:05.440 --> 24:06.960\n And then they'll play with this infinity\n\n24:06.960 --> 24:10.300\n as if they can play with it on the level of intuition\n\n24:10.300 --> 24:12.320\n as opposed to on the level of math.\n\n24:12.320 --> 24:14.100\n You know, yeah, maybe it's something cyclical\n\n24:14.100 --> 24:15.320\n you can imagine in infinity,\n\n24:15.320 --> 24:17.400\n just going around the same,\n\n24:18.580 --> 24:20.540\n kind of like a Mobius strip situation.\n\n24:20.540 --> 24:23.780\n But then the question then arises,\n\n24:23.780 --> 24:26.500\n how do you make it more or less infinite?\n\n24:26.500 --> 24:28.940\n Yeah, all of that intuition fails completely.\n\n24:28.940 --> 24:31.320\n And I mean, how do you represent it in a computer, right?\n\n24:31.320 --> 24:33.400\n It's either some placeholder for infinity\n\n24:33.400 --> 24:34.780\n or it's one divided by a very,\n\n24:34.780 --> 24:38.260\n the smallest possible real number\n\n24:38.260 --> 24:39.700\n that you can represent in the memory.\n\n24:39.700 --> 24:42.500\n Well, that's basically my undergraduate study\n\n24:42.500 --> 24:44.260\n in computer science is how to represent\n\n24:44.260 --> 24:45.860\n a floating point in a computer.\n\n24:45.860 --> 24:47.940\n I think I took 17 courses on this topic.\n\n24:47.940 --> 24:49.060\n It was very useful.\n\n24:49.060 --> 24:49.980\n I came to the right place.\n\n24:49.980 --> 24:53.580\n But in terms of what a physicist will mean,\n\n24:53.580 --> 24:55.700\n and you're right, I mean, physicists will blithely,\n\n24:55.700 --> 24:58.900\n nonchalantly subtract infinity, renormalization,\n\n24:58.900 --> 25:01.220\n and do things to get finite answers.\n\n25:01.220 --> 25:03.020\n And it's miraculous.\n\n25:03.020 --> 25:05.460\n But at a certain point, you have to ask,\n\n25:05.460 --> 25:07.420\n well, what are the consequences for the real world?\n\n25:07.420 --> 25:10.260\n So one of them, you ask, what's the problem?\n\n25:10.260 --> 25:11.800\n Does it make us more meaningless?\n\n25:11.800 --> 25:14.060\n They purport, many of the people that support it,\n\n25:14.060 --> 25:15.260\n like Andrei Linde.\n\n25:15.260 --> 25:18.100\n In fact, Andrei Linde says, you have a bias.\n\n25:18.100 --> 25:19.780\n You, Lex, me, Brian.\n\n25:19.780 --> 25:22.980\n You have a bias that you believe in a universe.\n\n25:22.980 --> 25:25.980\n But shouldn't you believe in a multiverse?\n\n25:25.980 --> 25:28.620\n What evidence do you have that there's not a multiverse?\n\n25:28.620 --> 25:30.100\n So he turns it around.\n\n25:30.100 --> 25:33.500\n Whereas Paul Steinhardt will say, no, if anything can happen,\n\n25:33.500 --> 25:35.940\n then there's no predictive power within the theory.\n\n25:35.940 --> 25:37.300\n Because you can always say, well,\n\n25:37.300 --> 25:39.140\n this value of the inflationary field\n\n25:39.140 --> 25:43.500\n did not produce sufficient gravitational wave energy\n\n25:43.500 --> 25:45.700\n for us to detect it with BICEP or Simon's Observatory\n\n25:45.700 --> 25:46.420\n or whatever.\n\n25:46.420 --> 25:48.540\n But that doesn't mean that inflation didn't happen.\n\n25:48.540 --> 25:50.700\n It's logically 100% correct.\n\n25:50.700 --> 25:55.580\n But it's like kind of chewing Wonder Bread.\n\n25:55.580 --> 25:59.100\n Apologize if they're one of your sponsors, but you know.\n\n25:59.100 --> 26:01.740\n Wonderbread slash lex.com.\n\n26:01.740 --> 26:03.620\n Type in code Klebb, right?\n\n26:03.620 --> 26:04.300\n Klebb.\n\n26:04.300 --> 26:06.020\n That's my favorite Russian word is like,\n\n26:06.020 --> 26:07.660\n would you like a piece of Klebb?\n\n26:07.660 --> 26:10.940\n By the way, even that word, Klebb,\n\n26:10.940 --> 26:13.660\n which means bread in Russian, as you say it,\n\n26:13.660 --> 26:15.920\n like you're jokingly saying it now,\n\n26:15.920 --> 26:17.500\n it made me hungry because it made\n\n26:17.500 --> 26:19.340\n me remember how much I loved bread\n\n26:19.340 --> 26:20.660\n when I was in the Soviet Union.\n\n26:20.660 --> 26:24.380\n When you were hungry, that was the things you dreamed about.\n\n26:24.380 --> 26:24.940\n I don't know.\n\n26:24.940 --> 26:28.380\n You know, what's amazing is how many of the Soviet scientists\n\n26:28.380 --> 26:31.860\n contributed to so much of what we understand today.\n\n26:31.860 --> 26:33.360\n And they were completely in hiding.\n\n26:33.360 --> 26:34.220\n There was no Google.\n\n26:34.220 --> 26:35.660\n They couldn't look up on Scholar.\n\n26:35.660 --> 26:36.280\n They had nothing.\n\n26:36.280 --> 26:37.820\n They had to wait for journals to get\n\n26:37.820 --> 26:40.580\n approved by the Communist Party to get approved.\n\n26:40.580 --> 26:43.060\n And only then, if they weren't a member of some class,\n\n26:43.060 --> 26:44.940\n I'm sure you know, like Jewish scientists,\n\n26:44.940 --> 26:48.260\n you had a passport that said Jew on your passport.\n\n26:48.260 --> 26:52.700\n And Zeldovich, the famous Yakov Borisovich Zeldovich,\n\n26:52.700 --> 26:56.300\n he was the advisor, one of my advisors, Alexander Polnareff.\n\n26:56.300 --> 27:00.460\n And he had to, only because he was like at a Nobel level\n\n27:00.460 --> 27:03.660\n and was one of the fathers of the Soviet atomic bomb program,\n\n27:03.660 --> 27:06.900\n could he even get his Jewish student, he was Jewish too,\n\n27:06.900 --> 27:09.420\n but only by virtue of his standing\n\n27:09.420 --> 27:11.100\n of his intellectual accomplishments,\n\n27:11.100 --> 27:12.740\n would they give him the dispensation\n\n27:12.740 --> 27:16.100\n to let his student travel to Georgia or something.\n\n27:16.100 --> 27:17.860\n And it makes what we complain about,\n\n27:17.860 --> 27:19.460\n and I complain about academia.\n\n27:19.460 --> 27:21.980\n And it's like, oh, well, what can I talk about?\n\n27:21.980 --> 27:24.140\n We have no idea of how good it is\n\n27:24.140 --> 27:26.620\n and that they were able to create things like inflation,\n\n27:26.620 --> 27:28.100\n completely isolated from the West.\n\n27:28.100 --> 27:29.540\n I mean, some of these people didn't\n\n27:29.540 --> 27:33.300\n meet people like Stephen Hawking until he was almost dead.\n\n27:33.300 --> 27:36.900\n And they just learned this thing through smuggled in.\n\n27:36.900 --> 27:39.300\n It's a work of heroism, especially in cosmology.\n\n27:39.300 --> 27:41.780\n There's so many cosmologists that worked incredibly hard,\n\n27:41.780 --> 27:43.380\n probably because they were working the,\n\n27:43.380 --> 27:45.500\n they could pass off as, well, we're doing stuff\n\n27:45.500 --> 27:47.980\n for the atomic bomb program as well, which they were.\n\n27:47.980 --> 27:52.300\n At the same time, there is interesting incentives\n\n27:52.300 --> 27:54.060\n in the Soviet system that,\n\n27:54.060 --> 27:57.780\n maybe we can take this tangent for a brief moment,\n\n27:57.780 --> 28:01.700\n that because there's a dictatorship, authoritarian regime\n\n28:01.700 --> 28:03.780\n throughout the history of the 20th century\n\n28:03.780 --> 28:07.780\n for the Soviet Union, science was prioritized.\n\n28:07.780 --> 28:10.820\n And because the state prioritized it\n\n28:10.820 --> 28:13.540\n through the propaganda machines and the news and so on,\n\n28:13.540 --> 28:16.180\n it actually was really cool to be a scientist.\n\n28:16.180 --> 28:18.020\n Like you were highly valued in society.\n\n28:18.020 --> 28:19.860\n Maybe that's a better way to say it.\n\n28:19.860 --> 28:23.540\n And I would say, you're saying like, we have it easy now.\n\n28:23.540 --> 28:27.660\n In that sense, it was kind of beneficial\n\n28:27.660 --> 28:29.140\n to be a scientist in that society\n\n28:29.140 --> 28:31.980\n because you were seen as a hero, as there's famous.\n\n28:31.980 --> 28:34.140\n Yes, the most famous hero of the Soviet Republic.\n\n28:34.140 --> 28:37.100\n And that, you know, there's positives to that.\n\n28:37.100 --> 28:40.300\n I mean, I'm not saying I would take the negatives\n\n28:40.300 --> 28:43.780\n or the positives, but it is interesting to see a world\n\n28:43.780 --> 28:46.140\n in which science was highly prized.\n\n28:46.140 --> 28:49.540\n In the capitalist system, or maybe not capitalist,\n\n28:49.540 --> 28:51.580\n let's just say the American system,\n\n28:51.580 --> 28:56.580\n the celebrities are the athletes, the actors and actresses,\n\n28:57.980 --> 29:01.100\n maybe business leaders, musicians.\n\n29:02.380 --> 29:05.620\n And, you know, the people we elect are sort of lawyers\n\n29:05.620 --> 29:10.620\n and lawyers, so it's interesting to think of a world\n\n29:12.300 --> 29:13.940\n where science was highly prized,\n\n29:13.940 --> 29:18.220\n but they had to do that science within the constraints\n\n29:18.220 --> 29:21.020\n of always having big brother watching.\n\n29:21.020 --> 29:22.260\n Yeah, the same in Germany.\n\n29:22.260 --> 29:24.020\n Germany had, you know, highly prized science.\n\n29:24.020 --> 29:26.540\n I mean, one of the most famous tragic to me cases\n\n29:26.540 --> 29:29.780\n is Fritz Haber who invented the Haber Bosch process\n\n29:29.780 --> 29:31.780\n that allowed us to, I don't know, have you eaten yet?\n\n29:31.780 --> 29:34.580\n You look, I mean, I know you fast, intermittent fast\n\n29:34.580 --> 29:36.020\n every day and you do that.\n\n29:36.020 --> 29:38.460\n You know, I said chleb and you got, it's a little drool,\n\n29:38.460 --> 29:41.420\n but he says I'm lifting and I look slim.\n\n29:41.420 --> 29:42.660\n This is amazing.\n\n29:42.660 --> 29:44.540\n I'm gonna clip this out and put it on Tinder.\n\n29:44.540 --> 29:45.420\n I think that's a website.\n\n29:45.420 --> 29:48.380\n You gotta swipe left or right for that, I don't know.\n\n29:48.380 --> 29:51.140\n But when you think about like, you know, what he did\n\n29:51.140 --> 29:53.500\n and created the fertilizer process that we all enjoy\n\n29:53.500 --> 29:58.140\n and we eat from every day, he was a German nationalist,\n\n29:58.140 --> 30:00.100\n first and foremost, even though he was a Jew.\n\n30:00.100 --> 30:02.300\n And he personally went to witness the application\n\n30:02.300 --> 30:05.260\n of ammonia, chlorine gas applied during trench warfare\n\n30:05.260 --> 30:08.540\n in 1916 in battles in Brussels and whatever.\n\n30:08.540 --> 30:10.900\n And he was, they had a whole conjure of Nobel laureates\n\n30:10.900 --> 30:12.780\n in chemistry and physics, you know,\n\n30:12.780 --> 30:14.460\n that would go and witness these atrocities.\n\n30:14.460 --> 30:17.620\n But that was also, they were almost putting science\n\n30:17.620 --> 30:19.780\n above, I don't wanna say human dignity,\n\n30:19.780 --> 30:23.660\n but of like the fact that he would later be suppressed.\n\n30:23.660 --> 30:27.500\n And actually some of his relatives would die in Auschwitz\n\n30:27.500 --> 30:30.020\n because of the chemical that he invented also\n\n30:30.020 --> 30:31.540\n called Zyklon B.\n\n30:31.540 --> 30:33.020\n And so it's just unbelievable.\n\n30:33.020 --> 30:36.100\n So I feel like that does have resonance today\n\n30:36.100 --> 30:38.700\n in this worship of science, you know,\n\n30:38.700 --> 30:41.340\n and listen to science and follow the science,\n\n30:41.340 --> 30:42.900\n which is more like scientism.\n\n30:43.740 --> 30:45.180\n And there is still a danger.\n\n30:45.180 --> 30:47.980\n You know, I always say, just cause you're an atheist\n\n30:47.980 --> 30:49.700\n doesn't mean you don't have a religion.\n\n30:49.700 --> 30:51.620\n You know, just because you, you know,\n\n30:51.620 --> 30:54.700\n in my case, in my books, I talk a lot about the Nobel prize.\n\n30:54.700 --> 30:56.660\n It's kind of like a kosher idol.\n\n30:56.660 --> 30:58.460\n It's something that you can worship, you know,\n\n30:58.460 --> 30:59.460\n it doesn't do any harm.\n\n30:59.460 --> 31:02.420\n And we want those people that are so significant\n\n31:02.420 --> 31:03.740\n in their intellectual accomplishments.\n\n31:03.740 --> 31:06.100\n Cause there is a core of America\n\n31:06.100 --> 31:07.380\n and the Western world in general\n\n31:07.380 --> 31:10.580\n that does worship and really look at science predominantly\n\n31:10.580 --> 31:12.020\n cause it gives us technology,\n\n31:13.220 --> 31:14.860\n but there's something really cool about that.\n\n31:14.860 --> 31:17.380\n And so for me, it's hard to find that balance point\n\n31:17.380 --> 31:20.780\n between looking to science for wisdom,\n\n31:20.780 --> 31:23.580\n which I don't think it has, they're two different words,\n\n31:23.580 --> 31:27.060\n but also recognizing how much good and transformative power\n\n31:27.060 --> 31:30.380\n maybe our only hope comes from science.\n\n31:30.380 --> 31:32.660\n You opened so many doors\n\n31:32.660 --> 31:37.660\n cause you also bring up our Ernest Becker in that book.\n\n31:38.820 --> 31:43.260\n So there's a lot of elements of religiosity to science\n\n31:43.260 --> 31:44.500\n and to the Nobel prize.\n\n31:44.500 --> 31:48.260\n It's fascinating to explore and we will.\n\n31:48.260 --> 31:50.140\n And we still haven't finished the discussion\n\n31:50.140 --> 31:54.100\n of the beginning of the universe, which we'll return to.\n\n31:54.100 --> 31:57.860\n But now since you opened the book, wow,\n\n31:57.860 --> 32:01.420\n pun unintended of losing the Nobel prize,\n\n32:01.420 --> 32:04.420\n can you tell me the story of BICEP,\n\n32:04.420 --> 32:05.660\n the background imaging\n\n32:05.660 --> 32:09.180\n of cosmic extragalactic polarization experiment,\n\n32:09.180 --> 32:11.420\n BICEP one and BICEP two,\n\n32:11.420 --> 32:13.180\n and then maybe you can talk about BICEP three,\n\n32:13.180 --> 32:16.340\n but the thing that you cover in your book,\n\n32:16.340 --> 32:18.740\n the human story of it, what happened?\n\n32:18.740 --> 32:21.700\n Yeah, that book is in contradistinction of the second book.\n\n32:21.700 --> 32:22.740\n That's like a memoir.\n\n32:22.740 --> 32:26.580\n It's really a description of what it's like to feel,\n\n32:26.580 --> 32:28.820\n what it feels like to be a scientist\n\n32:28.820 --> 32:32.180\n and to come up with the ignorance, uncertainty,\n\n32:32.180 --> 32:35.220\n imposter syndrome, which I cover in the later book\n\n32:35.220 --> 32:38.260\n in more detail, but to really feel like\n\n32:38.260 --> 32:41.500\n you're doing something and it's all you think about.\n\n32:41.500 --> 32:43.540\n It is all consuming.\n\n32:43.540 --> 32:45.500\n And it's something I couldn't have done now\n\n32:45.500 --> 32:47.300\n cause I have too many other,\n\n32:47.300 --> 32:50.060\n wonderful, delightful demands of my time.\n\n32:50.060 --> 32:51.660\n But to go back to that moment\n\n32:51.660 --> 32:53.940\n when I was first captivated by the night sky\n\n32:53.940 --> 32:56.100\n who has a 12 year old, 13 year old,\n\n32:56.100 --> 32:59.740\n and really mixed together throughout my scientific story\n\n32:59.740 --> 33:01.740\n has always been wanting to approach\n\n33:01.740 --> 33:02.980\n the greatest mystery of all,\n\n33:02.980 --> 33:05.940\n which I think is the existence or non existence of God.\n\n33:05.940 --> 33:08.900\n So I call myself a practicing agnostic.\n\n33:08.900 --> 33:12.580\n In other words, I do things that religious people do\n\n33:12.580 --> 33:16.060\n and I don't do things that atheist people do.\n\n33:16.060 --> 33:18.020\n And I once had this conversation,\n\n33:18.020 --> 33:19.300\n with my first podcast guest actually,\n\n33:19.300 --> 33:21.500\n I shouldn't say, oh, I was just having a conversation\n\n33:21.500 --> 33:24.180\n with Freeman Dyson, but he was actually my first guest.\n\n33:24.180 --> 33:25.020\n And I miss him.\n\n33:25.020 --> 33:25.840\n Name drop.\n\n33:25.840 --> 33:27.300\n Name drop, yes.\n\n33:27.300 --> 33:30.020\n I'm sure there's gonna be plenty of comments about that.\n\n33:30.020 --> 33:33.260\n In case people don't know, Brian Keating is the host\n\n33:33.260 --> 33:34.860\n of Into the Impossible podcast,\n\n33:34.860 --> 33:38.700\n where he's talked to some of the greatest scientists\n\n33:38.700 --> 33:41.180\n in history of science, physicists,\n\n33:41.180 --> 33:43.300\n especially in the history of science.\n\n33:43.300 --> 33:45.180\n So when I talked to Freeman, I said,\n\n33:45.180 --> 33:47.660\n Freeman, you call yourself an agnostic too.\n\n33:47.660 --> 33:50.060\n Can you tell me something like what do you do on Saturday,\n\n33:50.060 --> 33:51.900\n on Sundays, do you go to church?\n\n33:51.900 --> 33:53.620\n He's like, no, I don't go to church.\n\n33:53.620 --> 33:55.380\n And I'm like, well, imagine there was\n\n33:55.380 --> 33:58.100\n like an intelligent alien and he was looking down\n\n33:58.100 --> 34:01.500\n or she, I don't know, thing was looking down\n\n34:01.500 --> 34:03.420\n and it saw Freeman and on Sundays,\n\n34:03.420 --> 34:05.260\n like a group of people go to church,\n\n34:05.260 --> 34:06.600\n but Freeman doesn't go to church.\n\n34:06.600 --> 34:07.660\n And then there's another group of people\n\n34:07.660 --> 34:10.220\n that don't go to church and those are called atheists,\n\n34:10.220 --> 34:12.180\n but Freeman calls himself an agnostic,\n\n34:12.180 --> 34:14.100\n but he does the things that the Richard Dawkins,\n\n34:14.100 --> 34:15.940\n he doesn't go to the same church\n\n34:15.940 --> 34:18.260\n that Richard Dawkins doesn't go to, right?\n\n34:18.260 --> 34:19.900\n So I said, how would you distinguish yourself\n\n34:19.900 --> 34:20.820\n if not practice?\n\n34:20.820 --> 34:22.180\n So I'm a behaviorist.\n\n34:22.180 --> 34:23.780\n I believe you can change your mentality.\n\n34:23.780 --> 34:26.060\n You can influence your mind,\n\n34:26.060 --> 34:28.460\n view your bodily physical actions.\n\n34:28.460 --> 34:30.500\n So when I was a 12 year old, I got my first telescope.\n\n34:30.500 --> 34:32.580\n I was actually an altar boy in a Catholic church,\n\n34:32.580 --> 34:34.460\n which is kind of strange for a Jewish kid\n\n34:34.460 --> 34:35.280\n who grew up in New York.\n\n34:35.280 --> 34:36.860\n Maybe we'll get into that, maybe not.\n\n34:36.860 --> 34:41.180\n But I was just fascinated by these, these.\n\n34:41.180 --> 34:42.900\n Can we get into it for a second?\n\n34:42.900 --> 34:45.140\n Okay, yeah, all right, let's go.\n\n34:45.140 --> 34:46.580\n All right, let's go there.\n\n34:46.580 --> 34:47.420\n All right.\n\n34:47.420 --> 34:49.660\n Let's go to a baby Brian or young.\n\n34:49.660 --> 34:51.100\n Young Brian.\n\n34:51.100 --> 34:53.100\n The new sitcom on CBS.\n\n34:53.100 --> 34:55.780\n Young Brian, born to two Jewish parents.\n\n34:55.780 --> 34:58.100\n My father was a professor at SUNY Stony Brook.\n\n34:58.100 --> 35:00.460\n He was a mathematician, eminent mathematician.\n\n35:00.460 --> 35:02.140\n And my mother was an eminent mom\n\n35:02.140 --> 35:06.600\n and a brilliant English major, et cetera.\n\n35:06.600 --> 35:08.100\n And they raised it, but they were secular.\n\n35:08.100 --> 35:09.600\n They, you know, we'd go to, I always joke,\n\n35:09.600 --> 35:12.780\n we'd go to synagogue, you know, two times a year,\n\n35:12.780 --> 35:14.100\n on Christmas and Easter.\n\n35:14.100 --> 35:16.700\n No, no, we would go, yeah, Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah,\n\n35:16.700 --> 35:19.460\n right, that's the typical two day a year Jews.\n\n35:19.460 --> 35:21.580\n And you know, we'd have, we'd have matzahs\n\n35:21.580 --> 35:23.320\n once a year on Palm Passover.\n\n35:23.320 --> 35:24.380\n And that was about it.\n\n35:24.380 --> 35:26.380\n And for years, I was like that\n\n35:26.380 --> 35:28.120\n until my parents got divorced.\n\n35:28.120 --> 35:31.100\n My mother remarried and she married an Irish Catholic man\n\n35:31.100 --> 35:32.360\n by the name of Ray Keating.\n\n35:32.360 --> 35:34.380\n My father's name is James X.\n\n35:34.380 --> 35:37.780\n So when she remarried Ray Keating,\n\n35:37.780 --> 35:39.920\n I was immediately adopted.\n\n35:39.920 --> 35:42.380\n I'm actually adopted into the Keating family.\n\n35:42.380 --> 35:44.740\n And he had nine brothers and sisters\n\n35:44.740 --> 35:46.380\n and just warm and gregarious.\n\n35:46.380 --> 35:49.460\n They, you know, did Christmas and Easter.\n\n35:49.460 --> 35:51.460\n It was one of the most wonderful experiences I had.\n\n35:51.460 --> 35:53.980\n And I do things with great gusto.\n\n35:53.980 --> 35:55.900\n Whatever I do, I want to take it all the way.\n\n35:55.900 --> 35:59.320\n So to me, that meant really learning about Christianity,\n\n35:59.320 --> 36:00.300\n in this case, Catholicism.\n\n36:00.300 --> 36:02.300\n So I was baptized, confirmed,\n\n36:02.300 --> 36:04.900\n and I said, I want to go all the way.\n\n36:04.900 --> 36:07.460\n I became an altar boy in the Catholic church.\n\n36:07.460 --> 36:10.460\n And you're going to be the best altar boy there ever was.\n\n36:10.460 --> 36:11.940\n I had like serious skills.\n\n36:11.940 --> 36:13.380\n You passed that collection basket.\n\n36:13.380 --> 36:17.660\n I could push people and get them to 2x their contributions.\n\n36:17.660 --> 36:20.540\n But in this case, I was 13.\n\n36:20.540 --> 36:23.360\n I don't know if you remember when you were 13.\n\n36:23.360 --> 36:25.740\n But if you extrapolate the next level up,\n\n36:25.740 --> 36:28.220\n it's like you go graduate student, postdoc, professor.\n\n36:28.220 --> 36:31.300\n The next level up from confirmation, altar boy,\n\n36:31.300 --> 36:32.240\n is priest.\n\n36:32.240 --> 36:33.860\n And I don't know if you're aware of this,\n\n36:33.860 --> 36:37.540\n but priests are not entitled to have relations with women.\n\n36:37.540 --> 36:40.780\n And as a 13 year old boy, kind of like future casting\n\n36:40.780 --> 36:42.660\n what life's going to be like for myself\n\n36:42.660 --> 36:46.580\n if I continue on my path, I found that maybe I...\n\n36:46.580 --> 36:48.220\n The math is not up.\n\n36:48.220 --> 36:49.140\n That's right.\n\n36:49.140 --> 36:52.580\n There was a serious gap in that future.\n\n36:54.360 --> 36:56.380\n And instead, when I should have been preparing\n\n36:56.380 --> 36:58.660\n for my Bar Mitzvah, as most Jewish boys would be,\n\n36:58.660 --> 37:01.540\n a 12, 13 year old boy, I actually got a telescope\n\n37:01.540 --> 37:04.160\n and became infatuated with all the things\n\n37:04.160 --> 37:05.000\n you could see with it.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:06.300\n It wasn't bigger than that one over there\n\n37:06.300 --> 37:08.300\n that your hedgehog's looking through.\n\n37:08.300 --> 37:10.040\n Is that a hedgehog?\n\n37:10.040 --> 37:13.100\n It's a hedgehog in the fog.\n\n37:13.100 --> 37:16.380\n I should mention, and we'll go one by one, these things,\n\n37:16.380 --> 37:18.220\n you've given me some incredible gifts.\n\n37:18.220 --> 37:21.660\n Maybe this is a good place to ask about the telescope\n\n37:21.660 --> 37:24.700\n that puts some clamps on and let the hedgehogs look.\n\n37:24.700 --> 37:25.640\n And using...\n\n37:25.640 --> 37:27.820\n Now you're officially an experimental astrophysicist.\n\n37:27.820 --> 37:30.100\n Why experimentalist versus an engineer?\n\n37:30.100 --> 37:31.540\n Because you assembled this telescope,\n\n37:31.540 --> 37:35.220\n you gave it a mount, and you connected it to a very powerful...\n\n37:35.220 --> 37:36.540\n Yeah, but there's no experiment going on.\n\n37:36.540 --> 37:38.340\n It's just engineering for show.\n\n37:38.340 --> 37:39.420\n It's very shallow.\n\n37:39.420 --> 37:41.580\n Experiment is taking it to the next level\n\n37:41.580 --> 37:42.960\n and actually achieving something.\n\n37:42.960 --> 37:44.980\n Here, I just built a thing for show.\n\n37:44.980 --> 37:45.820\n Well, that's always a joke.\n\n37:45.820 --> 37:47.580\n People say, oh, you're an experimental cosmologist.\n\n37:47.580 --> 37:49.860\n I'm like, yeah, I build a lot of universes.\n\n37:49.860 --> 37:52.140\n Actually, most of my time is putting clamps on things,\n\n37:52.140 --> 37:53.140\n soldering things.\n\n37:53.140 --> 37:55.420\n It's not actually doing the stroking\n\n37:55.420 --> 37:57.980\n of my non existent beard, contemplating the cyclic\n\n37:57.980 --> 38:00.220\n versus the bouncing cosmological monitor.\n\n38:00.220 --> 38:04.060\n Just like most of robotics is just using Velcro for things.\n\n38:04.060 --> 38:06.380\n Right, yeah, it's not like having dancing dogs\n\n38:06.380 --> 38:07.580\n and whatever, right?\n\n38:07.580 --> 38:08.420\n So telescope.\n\n38:08.420 --> 38:09.860\n Yes, this telescope.\n\n38:09.860 --> 38:11.340\n What's the story of this little telescope?\n\n38:11.340 --> 38:14.580\n This telescope's a very precious thing in some ways,\n\n38:14.580 --> 38:18.500\n a symbol of what got me into...\n\n38:18.500 --> 38:21.140\n What brought me all the blessings I have in my life\n\n38:21.140 --> 38:22.340\n came from a telescope.\n\n38:22.340 --> 38:26.480\n And I always advise parents or even people for themselves.\n\n38:26.480 --> 38:28.740\n You right here, wherever we are,\n\n38:28.740 --> 38:30.220\n a biggest city on earth, Manhattan,\n\n38:30.220 --> 38:31.700\n where I was growing up as a 12 year old\n\n38:31.700 --> 38:33.380\n outside of Manhattan.\n\n38:33.380 --> 38:35.600\n You can see the exact same craters on the moon,\n\n38:35.600 --> 38:38.780\n the same rings of Saturn, the same moons of Jupiter,\n\n38:38.780 --> 38:40.260\n the same phases of the...\n\n38:40.260 --> 38:42.500\n You can see the Andromeda galaxy,\n\n38:42.500 --> 38:45.700\n Lex, two and a half million light years away from earth.\n\n38:45.700 --> 38:47.700\n You can do that with that little thing over there.\n\n38:47.700 --> 38:48.740\n One that's a little more expensive.\n\n38:48.740 --> 38:51.220\n Get one that has a mount and you could attach now\n\n38:51.220 --> 38:52.260\n your smartphone.\n\n38:52.260 --> 38:53.080\n What the hell is that?\n\n38:53.080 --> 38:55.540\n I wouldn't have known what that was in 1994.\n\n38:55.540 --> 38:58.900\n And with that, you can do something that no other science\n\n38:58.900 --> 39:00.820\n to my knowledge can really replicate,\n\n39:00.820 --> 39:02.360\n maybe biology in some sense,\n\n39:02.360 --> 39:06.700\n but you can experience the physical sensation\n\n39:06.700 --> 39:10.180\n that Galileo experienced when he turned a telescope\n\n39:10.180 --> 39:12.980\n like that to Jupiter and saw these four dots around it.\n\n39:12.980 --> 39:15.540\n Or that Saturn had ears as he called it.\n\n39:15.540 --> 39:18.100\n Or that the moon was not crystalline polished smooth\n\n39:18.100 --> 39:20.520\n and made of this heavenly substance,\n\n39:20.520 --> 39:22.700\n the quintessence substance, right?\n\n39:22.700 --> 39:26.040\n So where else can you be viscerally connected\n\n39:26.040 --> 39:27.680\n with the first person to ever make that discovery?\n\n39:27.680 --> 39:29.540\n Try doing that with the Higgs boson.\n\n39:29.540 --> 39:33.580\n Get yourself an LHC and smash together high luminosity,\n\n39:33.580 --> 39:36.140\n call up Harry Cliffe and say, I want to replicate.\n\n39:36.140 --> 39:36.980\n How did you feel?\n\n39:36.980 --> 39:38.180\n He didn't feel anything.\n\n39:38.180 --> 39:39.240\n None of them felt anything.\n\n39:39.240 --> 39:42.060\n It took years to go, you can't do it.\n\n39:42.060 --> 39:44.420\n But with this, you can feel the exact same emotions.\n\n39:44.420 --> 39:45.420\n That's fascinating.\n\n39:45.420 --> 39:49.180\n It's almost like maybe there's another one like that\n\n39:49.180 --> 39:50.180\n is fire.\n\n39:50.180 --> 39:53.620\n Like when you build a bonfire, can you actually get it?\n\n39:53.620 --> 39:56.860\n See, if you use a lighter, I think if you actually\n\n39:56.860 --> 39:58.900\n by rubbing sticks together or however you do it\n\n39:58.900 --> 40:00.860\n without any of the modern tools,\n\n40:00.860 --> 40:02.340\n that's probably what that's like.\n\n40:02.340 --> 40:04.860\n And then you get to experience the magic of it,\n\n40:04.860 --> 40:07.620\n of what like early humans homo sapiens felt.\n\n40:07.620 --> 40:10.480\n You feel what Aug felt when he did it that first time.\n\n40:10.480 --> 40:11.940\n By the way, is this a gift?\n\n40:11.940 --> 40:13.060\n This is a gift, of course.\n\n40:13.060 --> 40:15.100\n You need a little bit of a swag upgrade,\n\n40:15.100 --> 40:16.180\n so I got you some gifts.\n\n40:16.180 --> 40:18.860\n Yeah, this is a, I'm pulling a Putin,\n\n40:18.860 --> 40:21.180\n like ask if this is a gift,\n\n40:21.180 --> 40:24.280\n making it very uncomfortable for you to say.\n\n40:24.280 --> 40:25.120\n Not really.\n\n40:25.120 --> 40:28.020\n This is actually my childhood telescope here, you know.\n\n40:28.020 --> 40:29.380\n But now I'm keeping it.\n\n40:29.380 --> 40:30.420\n That's right.\n\n40:30.420 --> 40:32.100\n So looking through this telescope.\n\n40:32.100 --> 40:34.660\n Was when your love for science was first born.\n\n40:34.660 --> 40:35.500\n Changed my life.\n\n40:35.500 --> 40:37.300\n Because not only was I doing that,\n\n40:37.300 --> 40:39.380\n I was replicating what Galileo did,\n\n40:39.380 --> 40:42.520\n but I was, and I'm 100% not comparing myself\n\n40:42.520 --> 40:43.660\n to Galileo, Galileo, okay,\n\n40:43.660 --> 40:45.140\n if there's any confusion out there.\n\n40:45.140 --> 40:47.260\n But I did replicate exactly what he did,\n\n40:47.260 --> 40:48.740\n and I was like, holy crap, this is weird.\n\n40:48.740 --> 40:50.180\n Let me write it down.\n\n40:50.180 --> 40:52.500\n So it had another effect, which all good scientists,\n\n40:52.500 --> 40:55.100\n budding scientists should do, and all parents should do,\n\n40:55.100 --> 40:57.040\n get your kid a book, a little notebook,\n\n40:57.040 --> 40:58.480\n tape a pencil to it.\n\n40:58.480 --> 41:00.980\n Write down what you see, what you hypothesize,\n\n41:00.980 --> 41:01.980\n what you think it's gonna be.\n\n41:01.980 --> 41:03.760\n Not like in the high school, you know,\n\n41:03.760 --> 41:06.420\n like hypothesis, thesis, but just like,\n\n41:06.420 --> 41:07.900\n wow, how did I feel?\n\n41:07.900 --> 41:10.180\n Better yet, astronomy is a visual science.\n\n41:10.180 --> 41:11.660\n Sketch what you see.\n\n41:11.660 --> 41:14.820\n The Lagoon Nebula, the Pleiades Seven Sisters.\n\n41:14.820 --> 41:16.900\n You can see them anywhere on Earth.\n\n41:16.900 --> 41:18.380\n And when you do that, again,\n\n41:18.380 --> 41:20.940\n you're connecting two different hemispheres of your brain,\n\n41:20.940 --> 41:22.140\n as I understand it,\n\n41:22.140 --> 41:24.660\n and you're connecting them through your fingertips.\n\n41:24.660 --> 41:27.020\n You literally have the knowledge in your fingertips.\n\n41:27.020 --> 41:30.140\n In your connection between what you see,\n\n41:30.140 --> 41:31.860\n what you observe, and what you write down.\n\n41:31.860 --> 41:34.680\n Then you do research, right?\n\n41:34.680 --> 41:36.380\n The goal of science is not to just replicate\n\n41:36.380 --> 41:38.620\n what other people did, is do something new.\n\n41:38.620 --> 41:40.380\n And that's why we call it research,\n\n41:40.380 --> 41:42.980\n and not just like studying, you know, Wikipedia.\n\n41:42.980 --> 41:45.980\n And in so doing, you start to train a kid\n\n41:45.980 --> 41:48.780\n at age 12 or 13 for 50 bucks.\n\n41:48.780 --> 41:49.620\n It's unbelievable.\n\n41:49.620 --> 41:50.700\n And now we can do even better,\n\n41:50.700 --> 41:53.020\n because you can share it on Instagram or whatever,\n\n41:53.020 --> 41:56.060\n and you can, by doing so, have an entree\n\n41:56.060 --> 41:57.700\n into the world of what does it really mean\n\n41:57.700 --> 41:59.980\n to be a scientist, and do so viscerally.\n\n41:59.980 --> 42:02.620\n You know, I often say, I was taught this\n\n42:02.620 --> 42:05.860\n by my English teacher, Mrs. Tompkins, in ninth grade,\n\n42:05.860 --> 42:09.600\n that the word educate, it doesn't mean to pour into.\n\n42:09.600 --> 42:11.300\n Let me pour in some facts and intellects,\n\n42:11.300 --> 42:12.740\n and you know, it's not like machine learning\n\n42:12.740 --> 42:14.660\n that you're just showing like billions of cats,\n\n42:14.660 --> 42:16.540\n or you know, you're not like forcing it in,\n\n42:16.540 --> 42:17.580\n you're bringing it out.\n\n42:17.580 --> 42:20.220\n It means to pour out of, in Latin, educare.\n\n42:20.220 --> 42:22.840\n And what more could a teacher want\n\n42:22.840 --> 42:25.060\n than to have something, the kid is just like gushing.\n\n42:25.060 --> 42:26.140\n No, you're not gonna see like.\n\n42:26.140 --> 42:26.980\n To inspire the kid.\n\n42:26.980 --> 42:27.820\n Yes.\n\n42:27.820 --> 42:28.640\n Inspire.\n\n42:28.640 --> 42:29.480\n Shout out to Mrs. Tompkins.\n\n42:29.480 --> 42:31.380\n Yeah, Mrs. Tompkins, she's watching, yeah.\n\n42:31.380 --> 42:32.300\n She's a big fan.\n\n42:33.860 --> 42:35.140\n Me, she doesn't care for it, but you.\n\n42:35.140 --> 42:36.080\n Yeah, excellent.\n\n42:36.980 --> 42:38.700\n We take those we love for granted.\n\n42:39.620 --> 42:40.780\n This is in Manhattan.\n\n42:40.780 --> 42:42.340\n This is in Westchester County, New York.\n\n42:42.340 --> 42:43.380\n Okay, got it.\n\n42:43.380 --> 42:47.140\n So okay, but then that's where the dream is born.\n\n42:47.140 --> 42:51.620\n But then there is the pragmatic journey of a scientist.\n\n42:51.620 --> 42:55.180\n So going to university, graduate school,\n\n42:55.180 --> 42:58.280\n postdoc, all the way to where you are today.\n\n42:58.280 --> 43:03.220\n What's that, what are some notable moments in that journey?\n\n43:03.220 --> 43:05.780\n So I call that the academic hunger games.\n\n43:05.780 --> 43:07.740\n Because it's like you're competing against\n\n43:07.740 --> 43:11.500\n like these people who are just getting smarter all the time\n\n43:11.500 --> 43:13.340\n as you're getting smarter all the time.\n\n43:13.340 --> 43:16.380\n They wanna get into a fewer and fewer number of slots.\n\n43:16.380 --> 43:18.340\n Like there's fewer slots to get into college\n\n43:18.340 --> 43:19.420\n than in high school.\n\n43:19.420 --> 43:20.900\n There's fewer slots in graduate school.\n\n43:20.900 --> 43:23.380\n There's fewer, very fewer slots to be a postdoc.\n\n43:23.380 --> 43:26.540\n And many, many, maybe infinitesimal number.\n\n43:26.540 --> 43:29.220\n We just did a faculty search at UC San Diego,\n\n43:29.220 --> 43:31.300\n 400 applicants for one position.\n\n43:31.300 --> 43:32.680\n It's almost getting impossible.\n\n43:32.680 --> 43:34.880\n Like I almost can't conceive of doing\n\n43:34.880 --> 43:37.100\n what these new brilliant young people applying\n\n43:37.100 --> 43:39.660\n to become an assistant professor at a state university\n\n43:39.660 --> 43:40.740\n that they're doing.\n\n43:40.740 --> 43:42.940\n It takes so much courage to do that.\n\n43:42.940 --> 43:45.700\n So I went from this kid in New York,\n\n43:45.700 --> 43:48.560\n thinking I would never be a professional astronomer.\n\n43:48.560 --> 43:50.960\n A, because I didn't know any, I'd never seen any.\n\n43:50.960 --> 43:52.580\n I didn't even know that they existed.\n\n43:52.580 --> 43:53.980\n And I thought, who the hell's gonna pay me\n\n43:53.980 --> 43:54.980\n to look at the stars?\n\n43:54.980 --> 43:57.300\n Like, won't they pay me to be like an ice cream taster?\n\n43:57.300 --> 43:59.300\n Like, it's just not something I could conceive\n\n43:59.300 --> 44:00.140\n of getting paid to do.\n\n44:00.140 --> 44:01.620\n Even if I had the brilliance to do it,\n\n44:01.620 --> 44:02.980\n which I didn't feel I did.\n\n44:03.820 --> 44:05.820\n And then I went to graduate school.\n\n44:05.820 --> 44:10.380\n And during graduate school, I had this kind of\n\n44:10.380 --> 44:12.980\n on again, off again relationship with my father.\n\n44:12.980 --> 44:14.500\n And I knew that he was a mathematician.\n\n44:14.500 --> 44:16.460\n He had left and gotten remarried himself\n\n44:16.460 --> 44:17.300\n and moved across the country.\n\n44:17.300 --> 44:19.580\n I didn't see him for 15 years.\n\n44:19.580 --> 44:22.100\n And in that time, I learned a lot about him.\n\n44:22.100 --> 44:23.980\n And I learned that he had gotten very interested\n\n44:23.980 --> 44:25.200\n not in pure mathematics,\n\n44:25.200 --> 44:26.620\n which he had been a number theorist\n\n44:26.620 --> 44:30.340\n and contributed seminal work on the offending equations,\n\n44:30.340 --> 44:33.140\n which play a role in Turing's work that you may have seen.\n\n44:33.140 --> 44:35.620\n But anyway, he had become interested,\n\n44:35.620 --> 44:37.940\n turned completely away from that into the foundations\n\n44:37.940 --> 44:40.100\n of quantum mechanics and relativity, which is physics.\n\n44:40.100 --> 44:42.260\n And by that time I was at Brown University\n\n44:42.260 --> 44:44.940\n and I was thinking, oh, maybe I'll be condensed matter\n\n44:44.940 --> 44:46.620\n physicist or experimentalist.\n\n44:46.620 --> 44:48.820\n I never thought I'd be a theorist and I'm not a theorist.\n\n44:48.820 --> 44:50.660\n So it was pretty prescient.\n\n44:51.900 --> 44:53.340\n But it always appealed to me,\n\n44:53.340 --> 44:56.140\n why not do what made me happy as a 12 year old?\n\n44:56.140 --> 45:00.100\n We often forget about those primitive things about us\n\n45:00.100 --> 45:01.940\n are probably the most sustainable, durable\n\n45:01.940 --> 45:04.220\n and resilient attributes of our character.\n\n45:04.220 --> 45:05.540\n So with my own kids,\n\n45:05.540 --> 45:07.300\n what are they interested in now when they're young?\n\n45:07.300 --> 45:09.020\n And it doesn't mean that's what they're gonna do.\n\n45:09.020 --> 45:10.620\n Some of them wanna play Fortnite,\n\n45:10.620 --> 45:13.060\n like professional Fortnite play, which there are,\n\n45:13.060 --> 45:14.980\n but the odds of that is less\n\n45:14.980 --> 45:16.060\n than the odds of being a professor.\n\n45:16.060 --> 45:19.340\n Can I ask you, is your father still with us?\n\n45:19.340 --> 45:20.180\n No.\n\n45:21.580 --> 45:23.580\n Just in a small tangent.\n\n45:23.580 --> 45:24.500\n Yeah.\n\n45:24.500 --> 45:25.820\n Do you miss him?\n\n45:25.820 --> 45:27.260\n Do you think about him?\n\n45:27.260 --> 45:30.940\n Does his mathematical journey reverberate\n\n45:30.940 --> 45:32.100\n through who you are?\n\n45:32.100 --> 45:33.220\n Oh yeah, absolutely.\n\n45:33.220 --> 45:36.020\n I mean, it did in very many ways\n\n45:36.020 --> 45:37.900\n and he's been gone for a long time now.\n\n45:37.900 --> 45:40.660\n Thinking back to that time with him,\n\n45:40.660 --> 45:43.860\n he must've instilled some capacity for me\n\n45:43.860 --> 45:45.820\n to only wanna spend my time,\n\n45:45.820 --> 45:46.940\n which is a limited quantity.\n\n45:46.940 --> 45:48.380\n I don't think it's the most limited quantity.\n\n45:48.380 --> 45:49.580\n Maybe we'll talk about that later,\n\n45:49.580 --> 45:53.620\n but to go into only the most challenging,\n\n45:53.620 --> 45:56.460\n interesting things with the limited time that we have\n\n45:56.460 --> 45:57.300\n while we're alive.\n\n45:57.300 --> 45:59.740\n And for him, it was the foundations of quantum mechanics.\n\n45:59.740 --> 46:02.700\n For me, it was the foundations of the universe\n\n46:02.700 --> 46:03.740\n and how did it come to be?\n\n46:03.740 --> 46:05.500\n And I felt like, well, people have been trying\n\n46:05.500 --> 46:07.260\n since Einstein to outdo Einstein,\n\n46:07.260 --> 46:08.980\n really have made great progress\n\n46:08.980 --> 46:10.860\n in the foundations of quantum mechanics,\n\n46:10.860 --> 46:12.620\n but this is an exciting time.\n\n46:12.620 --> 46:15.060\n The COBE satellite had just released its data\n\n46:15.060 --> 46:17.500\n that the universe had this anisotropy pattern.\n\n46:17.500 --> 46:20.100\n Stephen Hawking called it like looking at the face of God\n\n46:20.100 --> 46:21.660\n and so forth.\n\n46:21.660 --> 46:23.700\n And so it seemed like this is a good golden age\n\n46:23.700 --> 46:26.380\n for what I'm gonna do and what I'm most interested in.\n\n46:26.380 --> 46:29.220\n But always throughout that, I wanted to understand,\n\n46:29.220 --> 46:30.460\n I didn't wanna be a wrench monkey,\n\n46:30.460 --> 46:33.100\n no offense to people that just do experiment.\n\n46:33.100 --> 46:34.260\n And no offense to monkeys.\n\n46:34.260 --> 46:35.740\n No offense to monkeys, that's right.\n\n46:35.740 --> 46:37.780\n This little guy, sorry, man.\n\n46:37.780 --> 46:40.620\n But thinking back to what animates me,\n\n46:40.620 --> 46:41.980\n it's not doing the engineering\n\n46:41.980 --> 46:44.380\n as much as it is getting the data,\n\n46:44.380 --> 46:45.380\n but there's a lot of steps.\n\n46:45.380 --> 46:48.420\n I wanna be the guy understanding\n\n46:48.420 --> 46:51.980\n what made the universe produce the signal that we saw.\n\n46:51.980 --> 46:54.260\n So I always joke with my theorist friends,\n\n46:54.260 --> 46:56.340\n call me a closeted theorist.\n\n46:56.340 --> 46:58.300\n Like I wanna be, you know what they call\n\n46:58.300 --> 47:01.420\n a guy who hangs out with musicians, a drummer.\n\n47:01.420 --> 47:04.100\n So I wanna be like that for physics,\n\n47:04.100 --> 47:04.980\n for theoretical physics.\n\n47:04.980 --> 47:07.060\n I wanna be like the guy doesn't do new theory,\n\n47:07.060 --> 47:09.260\n but understands the theory that the new theorists are doing.\n\n47:09.260 --> 47:12.580\n I love that formulation of a theorist\n\n47:12.580 --> 47:17.380\n is understanding the source of the signal you're getting.\n\n47:17.380 --> 47:19.060\n Like signal is primary.\n\n47:19.060 --> 47:22.500\n Like the thing you measure is primary\n\n47:22.500 --> 47:26.700\n and theory is just the search of explaining\n\n47:28.260 --> 47:31.860\n how that signal originated, but it's all about the signal.\n\n47:31.860 --> 47:34.260\n I mean, I see the same search for the human mind\n\n47:34.260 --> 47:37.980\n and like neuroscience in that same kind of way.\n\n47:37.980 --> 47:39.900\n It's ultimately about the signal,\n\n47:39.900 --> 47:42.500\n but you kind of hope to understand\n\n47:42.500 --> 47:43.860\n how that signal originated.\n\n47:43.860 --> 47:45.140\n That's fascinating.\n\n47:45.140 --> 47:50.140\n That's such a beautiful way to explain experimental physics\n\n47:52.940 --> 47:54.860\n because it ultimately at the end of the day\n\n47:54.860 --> 47:57.420\n is all about the signal.\n\n47:57.420 --> 47:58.460\n Yeah.\n\n47:58.460 --> 48:00.180\n Yeah, and maybe those two things,\n\n48:00.180 --> 48:02.580\n the neuroscience and the cosmos,\n\n48:02.580 --> 48:04.700\n not getting too romantic, but yeah,\n\n48:04.700 --> 48:07.300\n maybe they're linked in some fundamental way,\n\n48:07.300 --> 48:09.780\n some fundamental cosmic consciousness,\n\n48:09.780 --> 48:10.660\n but.\n\n48:10.660 --> 48:11.500\n We're gonna get to that.\n\n48:11.500 --> 48:12.340\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n48:12.340 --> 48:14.500\n No, we definitely have to get back to that.\n\n48:14.500 --> 48:16.700\n But getting back to, yeah, so my origins.\n\n48:16.700 --> 48:18.620\n So I always say like, and I wanna try this on you.\n\n48:18.620 --> 48:20.220\n You said you wouldn't answer any of my questions,\n\n48:20.220 --> 48:21.260\n but I'm gonna ask you some questions.\n\n48:21.260 --> 48:23.020\n What's the most important day on the calendar?\n\n48:23.020 --> 48:24.540\n Don't tell me the date, but to you,\n\n48:24.540 --> 48:27.940\n what's the most important day to you every year?\n\n48:27.940 --> 48:29.580\n Do I have to answer or do I have to think about it?\n\n48:29.580 --> 48:30.500\n No, no, answer.\n\n48:30.500 --> 48:31.900\n Like, you don't have to tell me the exact date\n\n48:31.900 --> 48:32.740\n of the calendar.\n\n48:32.740 --> 48:35.380\n It could be like your mistress's birthday or whatever, but.\n\n48:35.380 --> 48:39.140\n I have so many I lose track, even though I'm single.\n\n48:39.140 --> 48:40.380\n How does that even make sense?\n\n48:40.380 --> 48:41.220\n I know.\n\n48:41.220 --> 48:42.140\n Okay, I'm sorry.\n\n48:42.140 --> 48:46.220\n So a day, like a month and a day, yeah.\n\n48:46.220 --> 48:49.540\n I mean, for me, it would be December 31st.\n\n48:49.540 --> 48:52.500\n Yeah, so I was gonna say New Year's Eve, New Year's Day.\n\n48:52.500 --> 48:54.900\n Some people say birthday, anniversary, kid's birth.\n\n48:54.900 --> 48:58.220\n They're usually signifying beginnings and ends, right?\n\n48:58.220 --> 49:00.420\n January means the portal between,\n\n49:00.420 --> 49:02.700\n the God was the portal between the beginning and the end.\n\n49:02.700 --> 49:05.100\n So you're looking back, maybe because you're Russian,\n\n49:05.100 --> 49:06.900\n like the death side, the light side,\n\n49:06.900 --> 49:10.220\n looking forward into January, the beginning, right?\n\n49:10.220 --> 49:15.220\n So everybody's most important day is usually some beginning\n\n49:15.980 --> 49:17.260\n or something significant.\n\n49:17.260 --> 49:19.260\n For me, it was studying the most significant thing of all.\n\n49:19.260 --> 49:20.620\n It's like, when did the universe get born,\n\n49:20.620 --> 49:21.940\n as I said before?\n\n49:21.940 --> 49:24.940\n And I didn't think there, again, I didn't,\n\n49:24.940 --> 49:27.180\n I just, there was some mental obstruction\n\n49:27.180 --> 49:30.540\n that I didn't realize that I could get past\n\n49:30.540 --> 49:32.700\n because I didn't think like anybody does it.\n\n49:32.700 --> 49:34.820\n Like I knew astronomers knew these answers,\n\n49:34.820 --> 49:37.380\n like the universe at that time, between 10 and 20 billion\n\n49:37.380 --> 49:38.220\n years old.\n\n49:38.220 --> 49:41.740\n Now we know it's 13.872 billion years old.\n\n49:41.740 --> 49:43.500\n It's incredible the five digit, you know,\n\n49:43.500 --> 49:44.620\n per significant five.\n\n49:44.620 --> 49:48.940\n What is it again? 13.872 billion years.\n\n49:48.940 --> 49:50.860\n 872 million.\n\n49:50.860 --> 49:52.900\n So is there a lot of plus or minus on that?\n\n49:52.900 --> 49:53.740\n Is it, what are the error bars on that?\n\n49:53.740 --> 49:55.260\n So for me, I'm 50.\n\n49:55.260 --> 49:57.340\n So it would be the equivalent of you looking at me\n\n49:57.340 --> 49:59.500\n and telling me within 12 hours how old I am.\n\n49:59.500 --> 50:00.340\n Yeah.\n\n50:00.340 --> 50:02.460\n It's a half a percent, percent level accuracy.\n\n50:02.460 --> 50:04.020\n There's a confidence behind that?\n\n50:04.020 --> 50:05.380\n Oh yeah. I mean, there's a significance.\n\n50:05.380 --> 50:07.100\n Yeah. No, it's extremely well measured.\n\n50:07.100 --> 50:09.100\n I mean, it's one of the most precise things that we have.\n\n50:09.100 --> 50:12.300\n In contrast to, again, 25 years ago,\n\n50:12.300 --> 50:14.580\n we didn't know if the universe was 10 billion\n\n50:14.580 --> 50:16.020\n or 20 billion years old,\n\n50:16.020 --> 50:18.860\n but there were stars in our galaxy that were believed to be\n\n50:18.860 --> 50:21.100\n as they are about 12 billion years old\n\n50:21.100 --> 50:22.660\n or in the universe that were 12 billion.\n\n50:22.660 --> 50:26.700\n So that would be like you being older than your father.\n\n50:26.700 --> 50:27.660\n It was embarrassing.\n\n50:27.660 --> 50:30.340\n Can we actually take a tangent on a tangent,\n\n50:30.340 --> 50:31.820\n on a tangent, on a tangent?\n\n50:31.820 --> 50:33.420\n How old is the universe?\n\n50:33.420 --> 50:35.980\n Can you dig in onto this number?\n\n50:35.980 --> 50:38.540\n How do we know currently with those,\n\n50:38.540 --> 50:42.740\n I guess you said four or five significant digits?\n\n50:42.740 --> 50:44.900\n So we can come about it from two different ways.\n\n50:44.900 --> 50:47.920\n One, basically they rely on the most important number\n\n50:47.920 --> 50:50.280\n in cosmology, which is called the Hubble constant.\n\n50:50.280 --> 50:52.660\n The Hubble constant is this weird number\n\n50:52.660 --> 50:54.180\n that has the following units.\n\n50:54.180 --> 50:58.300\n It has the units of kilometers per second per megaparsec.\n\n50:58.300 --> 51:00.340\n So it's a speed per distance,\n\n51:00.340 --> 51:02.860\n which means you multiply it by distance and you get a speed.\n\n51:02.860 --> 51:04.300\n And what is the speed you're measuring?\n\n51:04.300 --> 51:06.140\n Well, you're measuring the speed of a distant galaxy\n\n51:06.140 --> 51:07.900\n at many megaparsecs away.\n\n51:07.900 --> 51:09.580\n So a galaxy at one megaparsec away,\n\n51:09.580 --> 51:10.860\n this isn't actually strictly true\n\n51:10.860 --> 51:12.940\n because of local gravitational effects.\n\n51:12.940 --> 51:15.460\n But if you go out, say one megaparsec away,\n\n51:15.460 --> 51:17.820\n I would say that that galaxy is moving 72 kilometers\n\n51:17.820 --> 51:19.140\n per second away from you.\n\n51:19.140 --> 51:21.620\n And every galaxy, except for the local,\n\n51:21.620 --> 51:23.480\n very most local group surrounding us,\n\n51:23.480 --> 51:25.220\n maybe a half a dozen galaxies,\n\n51:25.220 --> 51:30.220\n out of 500 billion galaxies to perhaps a trillion galaxies.\n\n51:30.220 --> 51:33.460\n So 12 out of that number are moving towards us,\n\n51:33.460 --> 51:35.100\n the rest are moving away from us.\n\n51:35.100 --> 51:38.140\n So that number, if you invert it,\n\n51:38.140 --> 51:40.940\n if you say, well, when did those things last touch each other,\n\n51:40.940 --> 51:43.460\n all those galaxies, now they're really far apart,\n\n51:43.460 --> 51:44.740\n we know how fast they're moving away.\n\n51:44.740 --> 51:46.700\n It's a very simple algebra problem to solve.\n\n51:46.700 --> 51:47.820\n When were they touching?\n\n51:47.820 --> 51:49.660\n That's where you get that number from.\n\n51:49.660 --> 51:51.900\n So there's the local 12 and then the rest.\n\n51:51.900 --> 51:52.740\n Ignore the 12, yeah.\n\n51:52.740 --> 51:54.860\n And then ignore the 12 and then look at the others\n\n51:54.860 --> 51:57.140\n and yeah, then solve the algebra problem.\n\n51:57.140 --> 52:02.140\n How does the stuff in the beginning,\n\n52:03.980 --> 52:05.620\n the mystery of that beginning epoch\n\n52:05.620 --> 52:07.420\n change this calculation of?\n\n52:07.420 --> 52:10.820\n Very little, because actually we understand\n\n52:10.820 --> 52:12.820\n how there's some other ingredients that go into it,\n\n52:12.820 --> 52:14.860\n namely how much dark energy there is in the universe,\n\n52:14.860 --> 52:16.420\n how much dark matter there is in the universe,\n\n52:16.420 --> 52:19.940\n how much radiation, light, neutrinos, et cetera there are,\n\n52:19.940 --> 52:21.280\n and how much ordinary matter,\n\n52:21.280 --> 52:24.660\n like we're made up of neutrons, protons, croutons.\n\n52:24.660 --> 52:29.060\n Okay, so let me, morons.\n\n52:31.300 --> 52:36.300\n It appears that the universe is bigger than it is older.\n\n52:37.500 --> 52:38.660\n How does that make sense?\n\n52:38.660 --> 52:40.460\n Oh, oh, yeah, so you're talking about the fact\n\n52:40.460 --> 52:43.900\n that we can actually see stuff in our observable universe\n\n52:43.900 --> 52:46.780\n that's located at a distance that is farther\n\n52:46.780 --> 52:49.740\n than the speed of light times the age of the universe.\n\n52:49.740 --> 52:51.600\n Naively you would say that,\n\n52:51.600 --> 52:54.640\n so you're right, if the universe were static,\n\n52:54.640 --> 52:56.220\n if the universe came into existence,\n\n52:56.220 --> 52:57.500\n and you can conceive of this,\n\n52:57.500 --> 53:00.460\n the universe came into a big bang in a fixed universe,\n\n53:00.460 --> 53:02.700\n so the universe just started off,\n\n53:02.700 --> 53:05.360\n those galaxies were, they could be moving\n\n53:05.360 --> 53:07.720\n towards us, away from us, who knows,\n\n53:07.720 --> 53:09.960\n that you could say I can see a galaxy\n\n53:09.960 --> 53:13.740\n that's at a distance of only 13.8 billion years\n\n53:13.740 --> 53:15.900\n times the speed of light, that would be true.\n\n53:15.900 --> 53:18.340\n But the fact that the light is expanding\n\n53:18.340 --> 53:20.440\n along with the expansion of the universe,\n\n53:20.440 --> 53:23.140\n so imagine there was some very distant past,\n\n53:23.140 --> 53:25.940\n we were near a galaxy, it's gonna produce some light,\n\n53:25.940 --> 53:28.300\n and that galaxy's going to be moving away from us,\n\n53:28.300 --> 53:30.380\n the light's gonna be getting more and more red shifted\n\n53:30.380 --> 53:31.940\n as it's called, and it's gonna be moving\n\n53:31.940 --> 53:34.820\n farther and farther away from us as time goes on,\n\n53:34.820 --> 53:35.900\n there'll be some acceleration\n\n53:35.900 --> 53:38.700\n as we get into the era of dark energy.\n\n53:38.700 --> 53:41.640\n The light signals, there'll be some cone of acceptance,\n\n53:41.640 --> 53:45.180\n if you will, from which, which represents all the events\n\n53:45.180 --> 53:47.700\n that we could have received information from.\n\n53:47.700 --> 53:50.900\n We can't currently communicate with that galaxy.\n\n53:50.900 --> 53:53.500\n It sent us some light, and now it's moving away,\n\n53:53.500 --> 53:55.480\n and it sent us some light, and because the space\n\n53:55.480 --> 53:57.860\n is also dragging the photons with it, if you like,\n\n53:57.860 --> 53:59.820\n the photons are participating\n\n53:59.820 --> 54:01.100\n in the expansion of the universe,\n\n54:01.100 --> 54:02.520\n that's why they're red shifting,\n\n54:02.520 --> 54:05.260\n that we can see things out to where the universe\n\n54:05.260 --> 54:09.220\n first began expanding, not just when it began existing.\n\n54:09.220 --> 54:10.680\n And because the universe has been expanding\n\n54:10.680 --> 54:14.100\n for 13.8 billion years, with no sign of slowing down yet,\n\n54:14.100 --> 54:18.060\n which is a huge surprise, serendipitous surprise,\n\n54:18.060 --> 54:20.300\n that we can see things approximately three times\n\n54:20.300 --> 54:22.140\n the age of the universe away from us.\n\n54:22.140 --> 54:24.100\n So we can see, it's called the age of the universe,\n\n54:24.100 --> 54:26.240\n 15 billion years, just to make the math simple.\n\n54:26.240 --> 54:29.640\n We see things at 45 billion light years distance\n\n54:29.640 --> 54:32.540\n in that direction, and we see things at 45 billion\n\n54:32.540 --> 54:34.260\n light years in that direction,\n\n54:34.260 --> 54:36.860\n just turning our telescopes 180 degrees away.\n\n54:36.860 --> 54:39.360\n So that means we see things that themselves\n\n54:39.360 --> 54:42.560\n are 90 billion light years away from each other.\n\n54:42.560 --> 54:45.360\n That's sort of the diameter of the observable universe.\n\n54:45.360 --> 54:47.100\n Is there another universe beyond that?\n\n54:47.100 --> 54:47.920\n We don't know.\n\n54:47.920 --> 54:49.660\n So in conjecture, there's not only one,\n\n54:49.660 --> 54:51.260\n there's an infinite number of them.\n\n54:51.260 --> 54:54.300\n How are you emotionally okay with the fact\n\n54:54.300 --> 54:55.980\n that our universe is expanding?\n\n54:55.980 --> 54:56.820\n So like...\n\n54:56.820 --> 55:00.220\n It's gonna be like Annie Hall, like with Alvy Singer.\n\n55:00.220 --> 55:02.540\n I grew up in the Soviet Union.\n\n55:02.540 --> 55:03.620\n We watched propaganda films.\n\n55:03.620 --> 55:05.420\n I realized that you did, yes.\n\n55:05.420 --> 55:07.860\n So there's a famous... Annie Hall, is that some kind of...\n\n55:07.860 --> 55:08.680\n What is the...\n\n55:08.680 --> 55:12.940\n It's a comedy, it's a propaganda movie with Woody Allen.\n\n55:12.940 --> 55:14.940\n Certainly canceled, but nevertheless,\n\n55:14.940 --> 55:17.660\n back when he was not canceled yet,\n\n55:17.660 --> 55:19.080\n he made a movie called Annie Hall,\n\n55:19.080 --> 55:21.820\n in which as a self depiction, he's like a Larry David\n\n55:21.820 --> 55:23.660\n before Larry David was Larry David,\n\n55:23.660 --> 55:26.060\n neurotic, typical neurotic young Jew.\n\n55:26.060 --> 55:28.780\n He's in Brooklyn and he all of a sudden tells his mother\n\n55:28.780 --> 55:29.940\n he's not doing his homework anymore.\n\n55:29.940 --> 55:31.340\n He refuses to do his homework.\n\n55:31.340 --> 55:32.380\n Mother says, why?\n\n55:32.380 --> 55:34.020\n Goes, because the universe is expanding\n\n55:34.020 --> 55:36.180\n and it keeps on expanding.\n\n55:36.180 --> 55:37.100\n Everything will rip apart\n\n55:37.100 --> 55:38.980\n and then we'll never have anything in contact\n\n55:38.980 --> 55:40.460\n and everything is meaningless.\n\n55:40.460 --> 55:43.860\n I assume these are some of the topics we're gonna get to.\n\n55:43.860 --> 55:45.620\n And she goes, what are you talking about?\n\n55:45.620 --> 55:46.780\n We're in Brooklyn.\n\n55:46.780 --> 55:49.100\n Brooklyn is not expanding.\n\n55:49.100 --> 55:50.820\n And that's true, Brooklyn is not expanding.\n\n55:50.820 --> 55:52.660\n The solar system is not expanding.\n\n55:52.660 --> 55:53.580\n Often times they get asked,\n\n55:53.580 --> 55:55.500\n what is the universe expanding into?\n\n55:55.500 --> 55:57.340\n That's one of my favorite questions.\n\n55:57.340 --> 55:59.020\n What is it expanding into?\n\n55:59.020 --> 56:00.940\n And I say, it's actually an easy question\n\n56:00.940 --> 56:02.340\n if you think about it.\n\n56:02.340 --> 56:04.780\n You've seen your friend Elon, he goes out into space,\n\n56:04.780 --> 56:05.900\n he's got a rocket, right?\n\n56:05.900 --> 56:07.840\n What's outside of the rocket?\n\n56:07.840 --> 56:10.120\n If you take this bottle, empty out this bottle,\n\n56:10.120 --> 56:13.260\n take the cap off it, go outside the rocket,\n\n56:13.260 --> 56:16.060\n sip in some Tang, screw on the cover of it,\n\n56:16.060 --> 56:17.060\n what's in there?\n\n56:18.260 --> 56:19.120\n Is it empty?\n\n56:20.720 --> 56:24.780\n That's just semantics, I guess, yeah.\n\n56:24.780 --> 56:26.020\n No, it's definitely not empty.\n\n56:26.020 --> 56:27.780\n So you step outside the rocket.\n\n56:27.780 --> 56:29.480\n Yeah, you're in the vacuum of space,\n\n56:29.480 --> 56:30.320\n the quote unquote vacuum of space.\n\n56:30.320 --> 56:31.780\n And there's no more liquid in it.\n\n56:31.780 --> 56:32.620\n There's no more liquid in it.\n\n56:32.620 --> 56:33.780\n No, it's just a container.\n\n56:33.780 --> 56:35.860\n One cubic centimeter, let's make it simple.\n\n56:35.860 --> 56:38.200\n One cubic centimeter of a box\n\n56:38.200 --> 56:39.400\n and you take it out into space,\n\n56:39.400 --> 56:41.620\n outside of a Falcon, whatever, right?\n\n56:42.700 --> 56:44.020\n What's inside that box?\n\n56:44.020 --> 56:45.100\n It's not empty.\n\n56:45.100 --> 56:47.340\n There's actually, I'm gonna say,\n\n56:47.340 --> 56:48.460\n this is gonna set your friends up.\n\n56:48.460 --> 56:53.140\n There's 420 photons from the fusion of the light elements\n\n56:53.140 --> 56:54.900\n that we call the cosmic microwave background\n\n56:54.900 --> 56:56.580\n inside that box at any second.\n\n56:56.580 --> 56:58.460\n Okay, all right, hold on a second.\n\n56:58.460 --> 57:03.340\n What, 420, I've heard of that number before.\n\n57:03.340 --> 57:04.160\n All right, let's.\n\n57:04.160 --> 57:06.780\n It used to be 69, but then they changed it.\n\n57:06.780 --> 57:09.260\n Wow, physics works in mysterious ways.\n\n57:09.260 --> 57:10.940\n In a millimeter box, it's 69.\n\n57:10.940 --> 57:12.740\n What are we talking about here?\n\n57:12.740 --> 57:16.460\n What's inside, what's in the box?\n\n57:16.460 --> 57:18.020\n I'm gonna get, that's right.\n\n57:18.020 --> 57:19.060\n Let's think outside the box.\n\n57:19.060 --> 57:20.220\n No, we're thinking inside the box.\n\n57:20.220 --> 57:22.380\n So if you have, every cubic centimeter\n\n57:22.380 --> 57:25.340\n of our observable universe is suffused with heat\n\n57:25.340 --> 57:28.520\n left over from the Big Bang, dark matter particles.\n\n57:28.520 --> 57:31.860\n There's a little ordinary matter in the universe.\n\n57:31.860 --> 57:33.020\n And every cubic centimeter,\n\n57:33.020 --> 57:34.700\n there's some probability to find a proton,\n\n57:34.700 --> 57:37.580\n a cosmic ray, an electron, et cetera.\n\n57:37.580 --> 57:39.660\n There's actually an awful lot of neutrinos\n\n57:39.660 --> 57:41.320\n inside of that cubic centimeter.\n\n57:41.320 --> 57:43.020\n Now just imagine how many cubic centimeters\n\n57:43.020 --> 57:44.540\n are in the universe, it's enormous.\n\n57:44.540 --> 57:46.640\n That's why there's enormous numbers of particles\n\n57:46.640 --> 57:48.920\n in our universe, it's a very rich universe.\n\n57:48.920 --> 57:51.140\n But now let's zoom in on that box.\n\n57:51.140 --> 57:54.000\n So now inside that box, there might be one,\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:56.260\n let's say there might be one ordinary matter,\n\n57:56.260 --> 58:00.000\n like a proton or an electron, a baryon, a lepton.\n\n58:00.000 --> 58:03.160\n There might be a couple hundred neutrinos\n\n58:03.160 --> 58:07.000\n and there'll be a couple hundred photons, as I said, 420.\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:08.520\n What's between those guys?\n\n58:08.520 --> 58:13.120\n What's between the protons and the neutrinos\n\n58:13.120 --> 58:14.120\n and the photons?\n\n58:14.120 --> 58:16.720\n Like just zoom into a cubic micron now.\n\n58:16.720 --> 58:19.400\n Like imagine 420 things inside a box this big.\n\n58:19.400 --> 58:20.640\n It's actually pretty empty.\n\n58:20.640 --> 58:22.400\n Like they're just zipping around in there, right?\n\n58:22.400 --> 58:24.480\n So between them, there's a lot of empty space.\n\n58:24.480 --> 58:27.960\n And this is outside the kind of physics based models\n\n58:27.960 --> 58:29.560\n of fields and all those kinds of things,\n\n58:29.560 --> 58:32.720\n just like asking the question of like,\n\n58:32.720 --> 58:33.560\n what is this emptiness?\n\n58:33.560 --> 58:35.880\n What's the particle content in the universe\n\n58:35.880 --> 58:38.440\n in every cubic centimeter of the universe?\n\n58:38.440 --> 58:39.720\n Outside of the 420.\n\n58:39.720 --> 58:44.480\n So you have the 420, they have some mass.\n\n58:44.480 --> 58:45.600\n Well, they have energy, they don't have mass.\n\n58:45.600 --> 58:47.320\n Photons don't have mass.\n\n58:47.320 --> 58:48.520\n That's why they don't bring suitcases.\n\n58:48.520 --> 58:50.080\n You know, that's true, right?\n\n58:50.080 --> 58:53.040\n Photons never bring suitcases with them\n\n58:53.040 --> 58:55.200\n because they're traveling light.\n\n58:55.200 --> 58:56.960\n See, I don't even get to laugh at you.\n\n58:56.960 --> 58:58.340\n That's corny dad jokes.\n\n58:58.340 --> 58:59.560\n Okay, you'll appreciate some.\n\n58:59.560 --> 59:01.520\n No, this is pretty good.\n\n59:01.520 --> 59:02.880\n I'm laughing on the insides.\n\n59:02.880 --> 59:03.920\n What's in the box?\n\n59:03.920 --> 59:04.800\n What's the 420?\n\n59:04.800 --> 59:07.440\n What's between the photons?\n\n59:07.440 --> 59:08.480\n That's what space is.\n\n59:08.480 --> 59:10.400\n That's what the universe is expanding into.\n\n59:10.400 --> 59:13.720\n Okay, so that's the notebook\n\n59:13.720 --> 59:16.320\n on which the photons are written.\n\n59:16.320 --> 59:17.160\n That's beautiful.\n\n59:17.160 --> 59:19.480\n But still, thank you.\n\n59:19.480 --> 59:24.440\n Still, I understand this, but it's still uncomfortable\n\n59:24.440 --> 59:27.720\n that if the universe is expanding,\n\n59:27.720 --> 59:31.540\n that this thing is expanding, the canvas is expanding.\n\n59:31.540 --> 59:33.280\n It's very strange.\n\n59:33.280 --> 59:35.280\n Because like if we were just sitting there still,\n\n59:35.280 --> 59:37.740\n I guess if we're in Brooklyn, nothing's expanding.\n\n59:37.740 --> 59:41.920\n So our cognition, our intuition about the world\n\n59:41.920 --> 59:44.000\n is based on this local fact\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:49.000\n that we don't get to experience this kind of expansion.\n\n59:49.560 --> 59:52.440\n Yeah, and that intuition leads us astray.\n\n59:52.440 --> 59:54.440\n But you know that gravity is the weakest\n\n59:54.440 --> 59:56.480\n of the so called four fundamental forces.\n\n59:57.360 --> 1:00:00.040\n And yet it has the longest range pervasiveness.\n\n1:00:00.040 --> 1:00:01.840\n Gravity is, you know, we're being pulled\n\n1:00:01.840 --> 1:00:05.360\n towards the Andromeda galaxy at some enormous rate of speed\n\n1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:07.840\n because of its massive counter gravitational force\n\n1:00:07.840 --> 1:00:09.680\n to the force we exert on it.\n\n1:00:09.680 --> 1:00:13.720\n So gravity is enormously long range, but incredibly weak.\n\n1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:17.720\n And because of that, we can think about these effects\n\n1:00:17.720 --> 1:00:21.920\n of expansion as the relationship between the,\n\n1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:25.560\n as you said, the grid lines on the notebook, right?\n\n1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:29.720\n Gravity is a manifestation of the interrelationship\n\n1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:33.160\n between those points, how far they are from each other.\n\n1:00:33.160 --> 1:00:36.400\n And those can change, those point distances can change\n\n1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:39.160\n over time because of the force of gravity.\n\n1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:43.040\n So it's weak and what we experience as gravity\n\n1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:46.600\n is the changing of those trajectories\n\n1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:48.900\n from being rectilinear to curvilinear.\n\n1:00:48.900 --> 1:00:51.200\n That's what we experience as gravity.\n\n1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:53.440\n You had this analogy when you talked to Barry Barish\n\n1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:55.760\n about bowling ball and a trampoline.\n\n1:00:55.760 --> 1:00:57.880\n That's almost right because it's actually,\n\n1:00:57.880 --> 1:01:00.120\n you have to visualize that now in four dimensions,\n\n1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:02.120\n like wrapping a trampoline at every point\n\n1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:04.400\n around the object, including on the sides,\n\n1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:06.240\n and it becomes very hard to visualize.\n\n1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:08.080\n So a lot of people use that.\n\n1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:11.100\n It's also a fraught analogy because you're using gravity,\n\n1:01:11.100 --> 1:01:13.420\n like the notion of gravity pulling something down\n\n1:01:13.420 --> 1:01:15.160\n to explain the notion of gravity.\n\n1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:18.320\n So it's a little overburdening, the analogy.\n\n1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:20.020\n But okay, so you mentioned Barry Barish\n\n1:01:20.020 --> 1:01:22.400\n wrote the forward to your book.\n\n1:01:22.400 --> 1:01:24.800\n How do gravitational waves fit into all of this?\n\n1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:26.740\n How do they, on the emotional level,\n\n1:01:26.740 --> 1:01:28.800\n how do they make you feel that they're just\n\n1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:30.960\n moving space time?\n\n1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:33.160\n Yeah, so gravitational waves were,\n\n1:01:33.160 --> 1:01:35.560\n the Nobel Prize for gravitational waves discovery\n\n1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:39.140\n the first time, it was discovered twice,\n\n1:01:39.140 --> 1:01:43.900\n indirectly by two men named Halcyon Taylor,\n\n1:01:43.900 --> 1:01:45.920\n and that was given my first year of graduate school.\n\n1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:47.840\n The day I entered graduate school almost,\n\n1:01:47.840 --> 1:01:49.720\n they announced these two guys won it,\n\n1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:51.160\n and the guy who won it did the work\n\n1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:52.720\n that would later win him the Nobel Prize\n\n1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:53.560\n when he was my age.\n\n1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:55.080\n Is this in the 40s?\n\n1:01:55.080 --> 1:01:56.880\n This was, no, this is 19.\n\n1:01:56.880 --> 1:01:57.720\n That was a joke.\n\n1:01:57.720 --> 1:01:59.120\n Yeah, that was good, that was good.\n\n1:01:59.120 --> 1:01:59.940\n I got it, I got it.\n\n1:01:59.940 --> 1:02:02.840\n You know, to a cosmologist, age means nothing.\n\n1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:03.920\n And to a tennis player.\n\n1:02:03.920 --> 1:02:04.840\n Not on Tinder.\n\n1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:06.680\n That's right.\n\n1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:07.640\n All right, sorry.\n\n1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:09.500\n Gravitational waves do fit in\n\n1:02:09.500 --> 1:02:12.080\n because what we're trying to do now\n\n1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:15.120\n is use the properties of gravitational waves,\n\n1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:18.260\n the analogous properties that they have to photons,\n\n1:02:18.260 --> 1:02:20.100\n that they travel at the speed of light,\n\n1:02:20.100 --> 1:02:21.180\n that they go through everything,\n\n1:02:21.180 --> 1:02:22.680\n they can go through everything,\n\n1:02:22.680 --> 1:02:24.640\n and that they're directly detectable.\n\n1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:28.600\n We're using them to try to confirm\n\n1:02:28.600 --> 1:02:32.000\n if or if not inflation occurred.\n\n1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.800\n So did inflation, the spark that ignited\n\n1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:37.200\n the fusion of the elements in the early part of the universe\n\n1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:39.520\n and the initial expansion of the universe,\n\n1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:40.640\n did that take place?\n\n1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:43.240\n There's only one way that cosmologists believe\n\n1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:44.560\n we could ever see that.\n\n1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:46.040\n Through the imprint\n\n1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:48.400\n of these primordial gravitational waves,\n\n1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:51.440\n not these old newcomers that Barry studies,\n\n1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:55.080\n the ones that occurred a billion light years away from us,\n\n1:02:55.080 --> 1:02:56.720\n a billion years ago,\n\n1:02:56.720 --> 1:02:59.560\n but we're seeing things that happened 13.82 billion years ago\n\n1:02:59.560 --> 1:03:02.000\n during the inflationary epoch.\n\n1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:05.520\n However, those, we cannot build a LIGO\n\n1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:07.920\n and put it at the Big Bang.\n\n1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:09.320\n So if you want to measure,\n\n1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:12.520\n let's say you have the old time firecracker,\n\n1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:13.680\n let's say there's a firecracker,\n\n1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:15.240\n and you want to see if it went off\n\n1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:16.840\n in the building next door to you,\n\n1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:18.040\n you can't see it.\n\n1:03:18.040 --> 1:03:21.080\n So you can't see the imprint of it, but you can hear it.\n\n1:03:21.080 --> 1:03:22.960\n And what we're trying to do is hear\n\n1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:25.720\n the effect of gravitational waves from the Big Bang,\n\n1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:29.320\n not by using a camera or even an interferometer\n\n1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:31.760\n like Barry used and his colleagues,\n\n1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:35.280\n but instead using the CMB, the light,\n\n1:03:35.280 --> 1:03:37.840\n the primordial ancient fossils of the universe,\n\n1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:39.600\n the oldest light in the universe.\n\n1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:43.000\n We're gonna use that as a film, quote unquote,\n\n1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:46.040\n onto which gravitational waves get exposed.\n\n1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:48.600\n And hope you can, so what are the challenges there\n\n1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:51.840\n to get enough accuracy for the exposure?\n\n1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:53.960\n So the signal, as I said,\n\n1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:56.840\n so there's 420 of these photons per cubic centimeter,\n\n1:03:56.840 --> 1:03:59.280\n and there's a lot of cubic centimeters in the universe.\n\n1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:00.800\n However, what we're looking for\n\n1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:04.840\n is not the brightness of the photon, how intense it is.\n\n1:04:04.840 --> 1:04:07.480\n We're not looking for its color, what wavelength it is.\n\n1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:10.200\n We're looking for what its polarization is.\n\n1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:11.800\n And we'll go, let me just ask,\n\n1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:13.960\n are you serious about the per cubic millimeter,\n\n1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:15.040\n 420 is the number?\n\n1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:15.880\n Centimeter.\n\n1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:20.240\n Yes, cubic centimeter, 420 is the number.\n\n1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:21.560\n I wonder if Elon knows this,\n\n1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:23.680\n and if he doesn't, he will truly enjoy this.\n\n1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:26.680\n Okay, yeah, that's true.\n\n1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:29.280\n Oh, okay, funding security, excellent.\n\n1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:34.080\n So I mean, this takes us to this story of heartbreak,\n\n1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:38.360\n of triumph that you described in losing the Nobel Prize.\n\n1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:42.360\n So describe what polarization is that you mentioned.\n\n1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:46.080\n Can you describe what bicep one and bicep two are,\n\n1:04:46.080 --> 1:04:48.800\n bicep three, perhaps, the instruments\n\n1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:51.440\n that can detect this kind of polarization?\n\n1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:54.960\n What are the challenges, the origin story, the whole thing?\n\n1:04:54.960 --> 1:04:57.640\n Yeah, so well, the origin story goes back again\n\n1:04:57.640 --> 1:05:00.200\n to like a father son rivalry, it really does.\n\n1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:02.440\n My father won all these prizes, awards, et cetera,\n\n1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:04.200\n but he never won a Nobel Prize.\n\n1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:08.000\n And some parents in America, they compete with their kids.\n\n1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:10.120\n Oh, I was a football player in high school, I'll show you.\n\n1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:11.640\n And whatever, wrestling, whatever.\n\n1:05:11.640 --> 1:05:13.840\n And some of us could be healthy too.\n\n1:05:13.840 --> 1:05:17.280\n But with me and my dad, it wasn't super healthy.\n\n1:05:17.280 --> 1:05:20.560\n Like we would compete and he was much more\n\n1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:23.080\n of a pure mathematician and I was an experimental physicist.\n\n1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:25.080\n So we had both different ideas\n\n1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:27.720\n in what was worth prioritizing our time.\n\n1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:30.040\n But I knew for sure he didn't win the Nobel Prize.\n\n1:05:30.040 --> 1:05:32.240\n And I knew I could kind of outdo him.\n\n1:05:32.240 --> 1:05:35.780\n So I feel pretty venal and kind of minuscule\n\n1:05:35.780 --> 1:05:37.240\n kind of character wise saying that.\n\n1:05:37.240 --> 1:05:38.800\n The only reason you could outdo him\n\n1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:41.760\n is because the Fields Medal is given every four years.\n\n1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:43.920\n And only if you're under 40, which he was.\n\n1:05:43.920 --> 1:05:47.640\n So he's working under much more limited conditions.\n\n1:05:47.640 --> 1:05:50.800\n That's right, so even if I had, which spoiler alert,\n\n1:05:50.800 --> 1:05:53.560\n the book's called Losing the Nobel Prize, so I didn't do it.\n\n1:05:53.560 --> 1:05:54.920\n But I wanted to do something big\n\n1:05:54.920 --> 1:05:58.080\n and I wanted to do something that would really\n\n1:05:58.080 --> 1:06:01.080\n just unequivocally be realized as in a discovery\n\n1:06:01.080 --> 1:06:02.840\n for the ages, as in fact it was\n\n1:06:02.840 --> 1:06:04.380\n when we made the premature announcement\n\n1:06:04.380 --> 1:06:05.760\n that we had been successful.\n\n1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:10.520\n So you were from the beginning reaching for the big questions.\n\n1:06:10.520 --> 1:06:11.440\n That's all I cared about.\n\n1:06:11.440 --> 1:06:14.480\n As an experimenter you were swinging for the fences.\n\n1:06:14.480 --> 1:06:15.680\n That's all I wanted to do.\n\n1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:20.680\n I felt like if it's not, if it's worth spending\n\n1:06:20.920 --> 1:06:24.320\n perhaps the rest of my life on as a scientist,\n\n1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:26.600\n it better be damn well better be interesting to me\n\n1:06:26.600 --> 1:06:29.120\n to carry me through, to give me the,\n\n1:06:29.120 --> 1:06:31.480\n I always say passion is great when people say,\n\n1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:33.720\n oh, follow your passion, but it's not enough.\n\n1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:35.880\n Passion's like the spark that ignites the rocket,\n\n1:06:35.880 --> 1:06:38.520\n but that's not enough to get the rocket into space.\n\n1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:41.840\n So then you swung for the fences with Bicep One.\n\n1:06:41.840 --> 1:06:42.760\n What is this?\n\n1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:45.240\n So Bicep One was born out of\n\n1:06:45.240 --> 1:06:46.520\n kind of interesting circumstances.\n\n1:06:46.520 --> 1:06:49.880\n So I had gone to Stanford University for a postdoc,\n\n1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:51.680\n so an academic hunger games.\n\n1:06:51.680 --> 1:06:54.480\n Stanford? Stanford University.\n\n1:06:54.480 --> 1:06:56.240\n Yeah, it's this small little school.\n\n1:06:56.240 --> 1:06:59.200\n It's not like that technical college in Massachusetts\n\n1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:00.660\n that you're affiliated with.\n\n1:07:00.660 --> 1:07:04.160\n But as I went there, I was working\n\n1:07:04.160 --> 1:07:05.760\n for a new assistant professor.\n\n1:07:05.760 --> 1:07:08.960\n She had gotten there only a year before I got there,\n\n1:07:08.960 --> 1:07:10.440\n and she had her own priorities,\n\n1:07:10.440 --> 1:07:12.040\n the things that she wanted to do.\n\n1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:14.500\n But I kept thinking in my spare time\n\n1:07:14.500 --> 1:07:16.100\n that I wanted to do something completely different.\n\n1:07:16.100 --> 1:07:17.700\n She was studying galaxies at high redshift,\n\n1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:19.800\n and I wanted to study the origin of the universe\n\n1:07:19.800 --> 1:07:22.200\n using this type of technology.\n\n1:07:22.200 --> 1:07:25.400\n And I realized, courtesy of a good friend of mine\n\n1:07:25.400 --> 1:07:28.320\n who's now at Johns Hopkins, Mark Haminkowski,\n\n1:07:28.320 --> 1:07:30.580\n that we didn't need this enormous Hubble telescope.\n\n1:07:30.580 --> 1:07:33.000\n We didn't need a 30 meter diameter telescope.\n\n1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.280\n We needed a tiny refracting telescope,\n\n1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:38.200\n no bigger than my head, less than a foot across.\n\n1:07:38.200 --> 1:07:40.080\n And that telescope would have the same power\n\n1:07:40.080 --> 1:07:43.120\n as a Hubble telescope, size telescope could have,\n\n1:07:43.120 --> 1:07:44.560\n because the signals that we're looking for\n\n1:07:44.560 --> 1:07:46.800\n are enormous in wavelength on the sky.\n\n1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:50.340\n They're enormously long, large area signals on the sky.\n\n1:07:50.340 --> 1:07:52.240\n And if we could measure that,\n\n1:07:52.240 --> 1:07:53.520\n it would be proof, effectively,\n\n1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:54.940\n as close as you get to proof,\n\n1:07:54.940 --> 1:07:55.960\n there could be things that mimic it,\n\n1:07:55.960 --> 1:07:58.900\n but that we discovered the inflationary epoch.\n\n1:07:58.900 --> 1:08:01.600\n Inflation being the signal originally conceived\n\n1:08:01.600 --> 1:08:04.240\n by Alan Guth to explain why the universe\n\n1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:06.440\n had the large scale features that it does,\n\n1:08:06.440 --> 1:08:09.040\n namely that it has so called flat geometry.\n\n1:08:09.040 --> 1:08:12.120\n So there's no way to make a triangle in space\n\n1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:15.340\n in our universe that has three interior angles\n\n1:08:15.340 --> 1:08:18.240\n that do not sum to 180 degrees.\n\n1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:19.600\n You can do that with spacecraft,\n\n1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:20.600\n you can do that with stars,\n\n1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:21.600\n you can do that with laser beams,\n\n1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:23.600\n you can do that with three different galaxies.\n\n1:08:23.600 --> 1:08:25.760\n All those galaxies, no matter how far you go,\n\n1:08:25.760 --> 1:08:27.840\n have this geometry, it's remarkable.\n\n1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:30.880\n But it's also unstable, it's very unlikely,\n\n1:08:30.880 --> 1:08:32.960\n it's very seemingly finely tuned.\n\n1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:34.720\n And that was one of the motivations that Guth had\n\n1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:39.160\n to kind of conceive of this new idea called inflation 1979\n\n1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:42.380\n when he was a postdoc also at Stanford, Slack.\n\n1:08:42.380 --> 1:08:44.400\n And he was trying to get a permanent job,\n\n1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:46.560\n I was trying to like make my name for myself.\n\n1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:48.600\n And so I realized I could do this,\n\n1:08:48.600 --> 1:08:51.820\n but I was also being paid by this professor at Stanford\n\n1:08:51.820 --> 1:08:53.080\n to do a job for her.\n\n1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:56.800\n And I was kind of a crappy employee, to be honest with you.\n\n1:08:56.800 --> 1:08:58.480\n And then one day she couldn't take it anymore\n\n1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:00.000\n because I was like sketching notebooks\n\n1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:01.300\n and planning these experiments.\n\n1:09:01.300 --> 1:09:03.120\n And I just, I wasn't, no, I actually.\n\n1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:06.080\n Big ideas in your mind, you're planning big experiments.\n\n1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:10.000\n And that was difficult to work with on a small scale\n\n1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.320\n for like a postdoc type of situation\n\n1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:15.320\n where you have to publish basic papers,\n\n1:09:15.320 --> 1:09:17.800\n deliver on some basic deadlines for a project,\n\n1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:18.640\n all those kinds of things.\n\n1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:21.120\n And support your advisors, paying, she was paying me.\n\n1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:26.040\n And so one day I came in and it actually involved\n\n1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:28.800\n another friend of mine, an astronomer named Jill Tarter,\n\n1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:31.760\n one of the pioneers in the SETI science business\n\n1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:33.480\n of detecting extraterrestrials,\n\n1:09:33.480 --> 1:09:35.900\n which I assume you'd never like to talk about aliens,\n\n1:09:35.900 --> 1:09:37.900\n so I'm sure we won't get into aliens.\n\n1:09:37.900 --> 1:09:40.180\n But Jill was visiting Stanford and I was like,\n\n1:09:40.180 --> 1:09:41.400\n I really wanna meet her, can you introduce me?\n\n1:09:41.400 --> 1:09:45.240\n And she said, no, in fact, you're fired, my boss.\n\n1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:48.920\n So I was like, this is possibly the best thing\n\n1:09:48.920 --> 1:09:50.080\n that could ever happen to me.\n\n1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:52.640\n I didn't know where it would lead or what would happen to it,\n\n1:09:52.640 --> 1:09:56.320\n but getting fired from this ultra prestigious university\n\n1:09:56.320 --> 1:09:58.440\n turned out to be the path, I mean, literally,\n\n1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:02.560\n that brings me here today, in that because of that,\n\n1:10:02.560 --> 1:10:05.800\n I ended up working for another person in Caltech,\n\n1:10:05.800 --> 1:10:10.080\n which is in Pasadena, and she, my original boss,\n\n1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:12.920\n Sarah Church, she got me the job with her former advisor,\n\n1:10:12.920 --> 1:10:14.980\n a man by the name of Andrew Lang.\n\n1:10:14.980 --> 1:10:17.720\n And Andrew was like, he was like this, I don't know,\n\n1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:22.720\n like he's like Steve Jobs or Elon, charismatic,\n\n1:10:23.640 --> 1:10:27.120\n handsome, persuasive, idea man,\n\n1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:29.260\n not the guy always in the lobby and doing everything,\n\n1:10:29.260 --> 1:10:33.960\n but understood where things are going decades from now.\n\n1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:35.200\n And he had been involved in an experiment\n\n1:10:35.200 --> 1:10:37.840\n that actually measured the universe was flat,\n\n1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:41.100\n very close to flat, along with a preceding experiment\n\n1:10:41.100 --> 1:10:43.440\n done at Princeton by Lyman Page and other collaborators.\n\n1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:45.240\n So the shape of the universe is flat.\n\n1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:47.640\n The geometry of the universe is flat.\n\n1:10:47.640 --> 1:10:49.400\n How did he do that experiment?\n\n1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:51.880\n So he used the cosmic microwave background.\n\n1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:54.760\n And so what I said is you have to look for triangles\n\n1:10:54.760 --> 1:10:55.600\n in the universe.\n\n1:10:55.600 --> 1:10:56.920\n So you can measure triangles on earth.\n\n1:10:56.920 --> 1:10:59.960\n You can actually, it's hard to show that the earth is curved,\n\n1:10:59.960 --> 1:11:02.000\n but you can show the earth is curved using triangles,\n\n1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:03.000\n mountain tops, et cetera,\n\n1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:04.840\n if you have an accurate enough protractor.\n\n1:11:04.840 --> 1:11:05.760\n Allegedly, yeah.\n\n1:11:05.760 --> 1:11:06.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:11:07.580 --> 1:11:09.700\n God, you're like auto canceling.\n\n1:11:09.700 --> 1:11:11.120\n This is great.\n\n1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:12.400\n My ratings are gonna go up, man.\n\n1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:13.640\n This is gonna be great.\n\n1:11:13.640 --> 1:11:14.480\n Take out the cake.\n\n1:11:14.480 --> 1:11:17.240\n If you want actual science, go listen to Brian.\n\n1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:19.720\n If you want all of these conspiracy theories\n\n1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:23.720\n or AKA the truth about flat earth, listen to him.\n\n1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:27.360\n So what he used was the following triangle.\n\n1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:32.280\n There are proto galaxy sized objects in the CMB.\n\n1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:34.560\n The cosmic microwave background has these patches.\n\n1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:37.840\n And so you can make a triangle out of the diameter\n\n1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:41.760\n of one of these blobs of primordial plasma,\n\n1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:43.880\n the soup that constitutes the early universe,\n\n1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:44.720\n which is hydrogen.\n\n1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:46.080\n It's very simple material.\n\n1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:48.840\n Understand hydrogen electrons and radiation, very simple.\n\n1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:51.720\n Plasma physicists, son, understand it.\n\n1:11:51.720 --> 1:11:54.680\n The diameter is one base of the triangle.\n\n1:11:54.680 --> 1:11:57.340\n And then the distance to the earth is the other two legs.\n\n1:11:57.340 --> 1:12:00.000\n So he measured along with his colleagues at Caltech\n\n1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.160\n and then University of Rome and that's other group\n\n1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:05.740\n at Princeton, measured the angle,\n\n1:12:05.740 --> 1:12:08.680\n interior angle effectively very, very accurately\n\n1:12:08.680 --> 1:12:11.280\n and showed that it added up to 180 degrees.\n\n1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:15.080\n Can you localize accurately the patches in the CMB?\n\n1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:19.040\n Can you know where they could trace them back location wise?\n\n1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:21.040\n You can know where they are, but more than that,\n\n1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:22.520\n there's so many of these patches.\n\n1:12:22.520 --> 1:12:25.680\n They're about one square degree on the sky.\n\n1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:28.840\n The sky, you may know, a sphere has about 44,000\n\n1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:30.520\n square degrees in a sphere.\n\n1:12:30.520 --> 1:12:33.960\n So there's literally 44,000 of these size patches\n\n1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:36.080\n over which he could do these kinds of measurements\n\n1:12:36.080 --> 1:12:37.680\n to build up very good statistics.\n\n1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:39.280\n That's not exactly how they do it\n\n1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:41.560\n or how they did it in this experiment called Boomerang,\n\n1:12:41.560 --> 1:12:43.840\n but they did measure very accurately\n\n1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:46.520\n the what was called the first Doppler peak\n\n1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:49.680\n or acoustic peak in the plasma, the primordial plasma.\n\n1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:54.680\n So the sphere has 44, approximately 44,000 square degrees.\n\n1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:59.760\n So to cover a sphere, that's a very kind of important\n\n1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:01.880\n data collection thing when you're sitting on a sphere\n\n1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:04.800\n and you're looking out into the observable universe.\n\n1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:07.880\n So there's a lot of patches to work with.\n\n1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:11.140\n Yeah, and in fact, a lot of the fast kind of algorithmic\n\n1:13:11.140 --> 1:13:13.880\n decomposition of spheres and machine learning\n\n1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:16.000\n in the early 2000s still used today\n\n1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.360\n was created out of this field by data analysts\n\n1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:21.680\n using this thing called hierarchical equal area triangles\n\n1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:24.600\n called heel picks is what it's called.\n\n1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:26.360\n And so just stitch all this stuff together\n\n1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:29.640\n and stitch it together very accurately.\n\n1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:32.160\n Yeah, get high statistical significance\n\n1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:34.960\n in order to reduce the statistical errors,\n\n1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:37.640\n very clean signal and a measurement device\n\n1:13:37.640 --> 1:13:39.280\n to reduce the systematic errors.\n\n1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:41.480\n Those are the two predominant sources of error\n\n1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:42.640\n in any measurement.\n\n1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:44.880\n Those that can be improved by more and more measurement,\n\n1:13:44.880 --> 1:13:46.480\n you take more and more measurements to this table,\n\n1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:48.240\n you'll get slightly better each time,\n\n1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:51.040\n but you only win as the number of the one\n\n1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:53.240\n over the square root of the number of measurements,\n\n1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:55.560\n but the square root of 44,000 is pretty big.\n\n1:13:55.560 --> 1:13:57.600\n So they were able to get a very accurate measurement.\n\n1:13:57.600 --> 1:13:58.960\n Again, it's not exactly how they did it.\n\n1:13:58.960 --> 1:14:00.920\n They also have to do a Fourier analysis,\n\n1:14:00.920 --> 1:14:04.000\n decompose that, do a power spectrum, filtration windows.\n\n1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.920\n There's a lot of work that goes into it, image analysis,\n\n1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:09.760\n and then comparing that with cosmological parameters,\n\n1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:12.080\n very simple model, just six different numbers\n\n1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:14.280\n that go into a model that made a prediction.\n\n1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:16.780\n And one of those is the geometry of the universe pops out.\n\n1:14:16.780 --> 1:14:19.520\n And that is the universe has zero spatial curvature,\n\n1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:20.960\n and that was called boomerang.\n\n1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:22.540\n So he had just come off of this.\n\n1:14:22.540 --> 1:14:25.240\n Now, let me remind you, who was the first person\n\n1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:27.280\n to measure the curvature of the earth?\n\n1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:29.880\n It's a guy named Aristophanes in the whatever,\n\n1:14:29.880 --> 1:14:31.960\n lived around Aristotle's time.\n\n1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:33.080\n His name is in the history books.\n\n1:14:33.080 --> 1:14:35.160\n So this guy, Andrew Lang, I was like,\n\n1:14:35.160 --> 1:14:38.040\n he's like the next Aristophanes.\n\n1:14:38.040 --> 1:14:39.960\n I just wanted to work for this guy.\n\n1:14:39.960 --> 1:14:41.560\n He clearly had this brand.\n\n1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:43.920\n He was about 40 at the time, California\n\n1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:45.800\n Scientist of the Year.\n\n1:14:45.800 --> 1:14:48.040\n I was sure he was going to win a Nobel Prize for that.\n\n1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:51.720\n And I knew that he, so I went down to Caltech\n\n1:14:51.720 --> 1:14:53.120\n to give my job talk.\n\n1:14:53.120 --> 1:14:54.860\n And he said, I love it.\n\n1:14:54.860 --> 1:14:56.020\n You got a job.\n\n1:14:56.020 --> 1:14:58.480\n And before I could even, before he finished the sentence,\n\n1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:00.040\n I said, I'll take it.\n\n1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:01.760\n It was too good to be true.\n\n1:15:01.760 --> 1:15:03.680\n And I started working there at Caltech,\n\n1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:05.880\n and slowly but surely, because Caltech's\n\n1:15:05.880 --> 1:15:08.280\n a rich private university, at that time\n\n1:15:08.280 --> 1:15:11.440\n run by a Nobel Prize winner by the name of David Baltimore,\n\n1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:12.520\n he just wrote us a check.\n\n1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:15.560\n Baltimore wrote us a check and said, get started on this idea.\n\n1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:18.000\n And so we started coming up with the idea for what I later\n\n1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.620\n named BICEP, background imaging cosmic extragalactic\n\n1:15:21.620 --> 1:15:23.840\n polarization, which is kind of ironic,\n\n1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:26.200\n because we ended up measuring galactic polarization.\n\n1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:27.960\n We'll get to that in a minute.\n\n1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:30.300\n But along the way, the idea was very simple.\n\n1:15:30.300 --> 1:15:32.800\n We're going to make the simplest telescope you can possibly\n\n1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:35.080\n make, which is a refracting telescope.\n\n1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:37.160\n Your eyes, you have two refracting telescopes\n\n1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:38.520\n in your head.\n\n1:15:38.520 --> 1:15:41.440\n Only way forward is making things more complex, right?\n\n1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:43.280\n And when you make things complex in science,\n\n1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:46.240\n you introduce the possibility for systematic errors.\n\n1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:48.320\n And so we wanted to build the cleanest instrument.\n\n1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:49.400\n Turns out the cleanest instrument\n\n1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:52.080\n you can build in astronomy is a refracting telescope.\n\n1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:55.240\n We also had to, unlike that telescope or Galileo's,\n\n1:15:55.240 --> 1:15:58.620\n we had to use very sensitive detectors that\n\n1:15:58.620 --> 1:16:02.200\n were cooled less than 1 20th of the temperature\n\n1:16:02.200 --> 1:16:04.600\n of the cosmic background itself, which\n\n1:16:04.600 --> 1:16:07.200\n is the coolest temperature in the whole universe.\n\n1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:10.080\n So we had to cool these down to about 0.1 or 0.2 degrees\n\n1:16:10.080 --> 1:16:12.320\n Kelvin above absolute zero.\n\n1:16:12.320 --> 1:16:14.880\n To do that, we needed to put it inside of a huge vacuum chamber\n\n1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:17.960\n and suck out all the air molecules and water molecules\n\n1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:21.020\n and take it to a very, very special place called the South\n\n1:16:21.020 --> 1:16:24.800\n Pole Antarctica, from which I retrieved for you a patch.\n\n1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:27.000\n There it is over there.\n\n1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:30.360\n So when you go there, you get these bright red jackets.\n\n1:16:30.360 --> 1:16:30.840\n Bright.\n\n1:16:30.840 --> 1:16:31.680\n Oh, yeah.\n\n1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:34.080\n As somebody who was born in the Soviet Union,\n\n1:16:34.080 --> 1:16:35.560\n we obviously like to call it red.\n\n1:16:35.560 --> 1:16:40.480\n United States Antarctic Program, the National Science\n\n1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:41.560\n Foundation.\n\n1:16:41.560 --> 1:16:44.360\n And the base is called the Amundsen Scott South Polar\n\n1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:45.400\n Station.\n\n1:16:45.400 --> 1:16:47.520\n So it's a little known fact of geopolitics\n\n1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:51.840\n that whatever country occupies a region has ownership over it.\n\n1:16:51.840 --> 1:16:53.340\n Now, there is a treaty in Antarctica.\n\n1:16:53.340 --> 1:16:56.160\n You can't use it for military purposes, for mining,\n\n1:16:56.160 --> 1:16:57.280\n et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:16:57.280 --> 1:16:59.400\n But I don't know if you know, but about 12 years ago,\n\n1:16:59.400 --> 1:17:01.720\n Putin sent a submarine to the North Pole.\n\n1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:04.320\n Now, there's no land at the North Pole, right?\n\n1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:05.040\n So what did he do?\n\n1:17:05.040 --> 1:17:07.800\n He stuck it in the ocean underneath.\n\n1:17:07.800 --> 1:17:10.920\n But the South Pole is on a continent called Antarctica,\n\n1:17:10.920 --> 1:17:13.240\n which was first reached about 110 years ago,\n\n1:17:13.240 --> 1:17:15.440\n the first time in human history.\n\n1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:18.200\n Antarctica means the opposite of the bear.\n\n1:17:18.200 --> 1:17:20.680\n It means no bears there, basically opposite\n\n1:17:20.680 --> 1:17:21.720\n of where polar bears are.\n\n1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:23.200\n Arctic means polar bear.\n\n1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:24.560\n That's where in the Greek.\n\n1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:25.160\n I did not know that.\n\n1:17:25.160 --> 1:17:25.880\n Fascinating.\n\n1:17:25.880 --> 1:17:27.880\n So Antarctica means the opposite place of that.\n\n1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:30.680\n Humans never even saw it, let alone went to the South Pole,\n\n1:17:30.680 --> 1:17:33.600\n which is kind of in the middle of the continent.\n\n1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:37.360\n We went to take this telescope somewhere extremely dry.\n\n1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:40.680\n It turns out the Sahara Desert, San Diego, Texas,\n\n1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:43.800\n and there's no place like the South Pole or Chile.\n\n1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:46.040\n Those are the two premier places on Earth.\n\n1:17:46.040 --> 1:17:47.700\n Of course, you'd like to go into space.\n\n1:17:47.700 --> 1:17:48.740\n There's no water in space.\n\n1:17:48.740 --> 1:17:51.240\n So it's not about cold.\n\n1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:52.000\n It's about dry.\n\n1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:52.960\n Exactly.\n\n1:17:52.960 --> 1:17:57.760\n So that's why, for example, you can take this vodka,\n\n1:17:57.760 --> 1:17:59.360\n and you could put it in this cup.\n\n1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:01.480\n And we could take it over to a microwave somewhere\n\n1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:03.080\n and heat it up.\n\n1:18:03.080 --> 1:18:05.960\n After two minutes, three minutes, the water's boiling.\n\n1:18:05.960 --> 1:18:06.700\n You can't touch it.\n\n1:18:06.700 --> 1:18:07.240\n Take it from me.\n\n1:18:07.240 --> 1:18:08.040\n Don't touch it.\n\n1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:10.400\n But you can touch the mug and take it out if you want to.\n\n1:18:10.400 --> 1:18:10.900\n Why?\n\n1:18:10.900 --> 1:18:13.000\n Because the mug is totally bone dry.\n\n1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:15.480\n But the microwaves get absorbed by the water molecules\n\n1:18:15.480 --> 1:18:17.480\n because water molecules resonate exactly\n\n1:18:17.480 --> 1:18:19.040\n at these microwave frequencies.\n\n1:18:19.040 --> 1:18:22.800\n So we don't want these precious photons, 420 of them,\n\n1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:26.040\n traveling per cubic centimeter from the Big Bang itself\n\n1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:28.040\n to get absorbed in some water molecule in the Earth's\n\n1:18:28.040 --> 1:18:28.800\n atmosphere.\n\n1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:30.640\n So you take it to a place with the fewest number\n\n1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:34.480\n of water molecules per square centimeter of surface area.\n\n1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:35.960\n And that happens to be either Chile\n\n1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:38.520\n or my other project, the Simons Observatory, is located.\n\n1:18:38.520 --> 1:18:40.720\n Or you take it to the South Pole.\n\n1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:44.760\n We took it to the South Pole and spent a couple of months\n\n1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:46.080\n of my life down there.\n\n1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:49.480\n And it's like being on Hoth.\n\n1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:52.720\n It's a completely otherworldly environment.\n\n1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:55.960\n Ice, planar, flat as a pancake.\n\n1:18:55.960 --> 1:18:59.960\n And the buildings are built up on stilts.\n\n1:18:59.960 --> 1:19:03.400\n They're built because the snow will otherwise cover them over.\n\n1:19:03.400 --> 1:19:06.840\n The nearest medical facilities are 4,000 miles away.\n\n1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:08.960\n If you have any issues with your wisdom teeth,\n\n1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:11.200\n they yank them before you go down there.\n\n1:19:11.200 --> 1:19:12.960\n If you have any issues with your appendix,\n\n1:19:12.960 --> 1:19:15.040\n they'll cut it out of you before you go down there.\n\n1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:17.080\n The Russians at Vostok base, not too far away,\n\n1:19:17.080 --> 1:19:18.960\n about 600 miles away.\n\n1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:20.960\n The doctors there, there's a famous picture of one\n\n1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:24.540\n of them operating on himself, taking out his own appendix\n\n1:19:24.540 --> 1:19:26.480\n in the middle of winter by himself.\n\n1:19:26.480 --> 1:19:27.680\n So harsh conditions.\n\n1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:29.840\n Science in the harshest of conditions.\n\n1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:31.200\n On Earth, at least.\n\n1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:33.040\n And we go to those great lengths because it's\n\n1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:36.520\n a pristine environment to observe these precious photons.\n\n1:19:36.520 --> 1:19:38.200\n And we built this telescope.\n\n1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:40.720\n And it weighs tens of thousands of pounds.\n\n1:19:40.720 --> 1:19:44.680\n And it had to scan the sky almost like it's a robot.\n\n1:19:44.680 --> 1:19:48.440\n I mean, it's scanning the sky almost unattended.\n\n1:19:48.440 --> 1:19:50.920\n We have a guy who spends a year of his life down there,\n\n1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:53.040\n a girl who spends a year of their life down there.\n\n1:19:53.040 --> 1:19:54.360\n They're called winter overs.\n\n1:19:54.360 --> 1:19:56.920\n They arrive in sometimes as early as November.\n\n1:19:56.920 --> 1:19:59.280\n And they don't leave until the following December.\n\n1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:02.760\n And we always joke, we'll pay you $75,000.\n\n1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:04.720\n You just have to work for one night of your life.\n\n1:20:04.720 --> 1:20:05.240\n That's all.\n\n1:20:05.240 --> 1:20:08.020\n But it's a long night.\n\n1:20:08.020 --> 1:20:10.660\n And what BICEP is, and I couldn't\n\n1:20:10.660 --> 1:20:12.640\n bring my polarized sunglasses here,\n\n1:20:12.640 --> 1:20:14.560\n so I brought these actual polarizers here.\n\n1:20:14.560 --> 1:20:17.120\n So if you take this and put it in front of your telescope\n\n1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:21.240\n there, you have now made a polarimeter.\n\n1:20:21.240 --> 1:20:24.180\n You have made a polarization sensitive telescope.\n\n1:20:24.180 --> 1:20:26.400\n Now, you may not be able to immediately know\n\n1:20:26.400 --> 1:20:27.920\n how you would use such a thing.\n\n1:20:27.920 --> 1:20:30.460\n But one way to think about it, now take this guy\n\n1:20:30.460 --> 1:20:33.760\n and look at a light, look at a light source.\n\n1:20:33.760 --> 1:20:34.880\n Put one up to your eye.\n\n1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:37.960\n And now put the other one in front of it anywhere.\n\n1:20:37.960 --> 1:20:40.000\n And now rotate them.\n\n1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:42.480\n What happens to the light source?\n\n1:20:42.480 --> 1:20:45.520\n Becomes brighter and dimmer and brighter and dimmer.\n\n1:20:45.520 --> 1:20:48.200\n Yeah, so it's called a quadrupolar pattern, right?\n\n1:20:48.200 --> 1:20:49.080\n So it's repeating.\n\n1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:51.800\n It goes bright, dim, bright, dim.\n\n1:20:51.800 --> 1:20:55.480\n It rotates twice in intensity for every single physical\n\n1:20:55.480 --> 1:20:56.720\n rotation.\n\n1:20:56.720 --> 1:20:58.720\n And that's because of the property of the photon.\n\n1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:00.560\n The photon is a spin one field.\n\n1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:04.880\n But the polarization of light is the axis\n\n1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:07.320\n at which its electric field is oscillating.\n\n1:21:07.320 --> 1:21:10.560\n Its electric field is marching straight up and straight down.\n\n1:21:10.560 --> 1:21:12.160\n And so therefore, vertical polarization\n\n1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:15.040\n is the same as negative vertical polarization.\n\n1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:17.600\n And so you get the same pattern as you rotate two times\n\n1:21:17.600 --> 1:21:19.240\n for every one physical rotation.\n\n1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:22.800\n This is like a spin two object.\n\n1:21:22.800 --> 1:21:26.320\n So now if you put that in front of the telescope,\n\n1:21:26.320 --> 1:21:27.560\n you can do one of two things.\n\n1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:29.280\n Now you're polarizing all the light that's\n\n1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:31.680\n going in because you have one of the polarizers.\n\n1:21:31.680 --> 1:21:34.120\n And then you can analyze it as you rotate the other one.\n\n1:21:34.120 --> 1:21:37.120\n You can analyze it and change the amount of polarization.\n\n1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:40.040\n Or you can put this kind of very special crystal in here.\n\n1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:40.840\n There's a crystal.\n\n1:21:40.840 --> 1:21:42.240\n It's called calcite.\n\n1:21:42.240 --> 1:21:44.840\n This is from Lex Luthor, not Lex Friedman.\n\n1:21:44.840 --> 1:21:47.560\n This crystal, put it on top of your printed notes\n\n1:21:47.560 --> 1:21:50.840\n there and tell me what does it look like?\n\n1:21:50.840 --> 1:21:56.440\n There's a, like I could see everything twice.\n\n1:21:56.440 --> 1:21:57.280\n It's a double image.\n\n1:21:57.280 --> 1:21:58.440\n It's a double image.\n\n1:21:58.440 --> 1:22:01.080\n That is a special crystal that has two different indices\n\n1:22:01.080 --> 1:22:02.680\n of refraction.\n\n1:22:02.680 --> 1:22:06.120\n So light emerging, which is unpolarized from the black ink,\n\n1:22:06.120 --> 1:22:07.320\n comes out.\n\n1:22:07.320 --> 1:22:09.840\n And it splits into two different directions.\n\n1:22:09.840 --> 1:22:12.560\n And it could split even more if I made the crystal give you\n\n1:22:12.560 --> 1:22:13.720\n my more expensive crystal.\n\n1:22:13.720 --> 1:22:14.360\n But that's all I have.\n\n1:22:14.360 --> 1:22:16.240\n What is the crystal with this kind of property called?\n\n1:22:16.240 --> 1:22:17.360\n It's called calcite.\n\n1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:18.240\n This is crystal.\n\n1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:20.000\n It's called birefringent crystal.\n\n1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:21.160\n Bi means two.\n\n1:22:21.160 --> 1:22:23.440\n Refringent means refracting.\n\n1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:25.480\n So this is a special type of material\n\n1:22:25.480 --> 1:22:28.040\n that separates light based on its polarization.\n\n1:22:28.040 --> 1:22:31.720\n It's a pretty clean bi signal.\n\n1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:35.120\n It's cleanly two.\n\n1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:36.760\n I'm seeing two very cleanly.\n\n1:22:36.760 --> 1:22:37.600\n It's very crisp, right.\n\n1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:40.000\n So that's yours to keep with every time you host me.\n\n1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:43.720\n Now, take the polarizer underneath your left hand.\n\n1:22:43.720 --> 1:22:47.480\n Put it on top of the crystal, and kind of move it back\n\n1:22:47.480 --> 1:22:48.000\n and forth.\n\n1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:49.400\n What's happening?\n\n1:22:49.400 --> 1:22:50.680\n This is incredible.\n\n1:22:50.680 --> 1:22:51.560\n You can switch.\n\n1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:55.760\n As you rotate, you switch from one signal to the other.\n\n1:22:55.760 --> 1:22:58.680\n So it's one of the refractions to the other.\n\n1:22:58.680 --> 1:22:59.200\n Whoa.\n\n1:22:59.200 --> 1:23:02.920\n So that is now you are analyzing the polarization.\n\n1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:05.200\n You're confirming the light comes out of the crystal.\n\n1:23:05.200 --> 1:23:07.200\n Two different types of polarization.\n\n1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:11.080\n And effectively, what we do is we have those two things,\n\n1:23:11.080 --> 1:23:12.040\n if you like.\n\n1:23:12.040 --> 1:23:14.800\n But working in the microwave, so that's\n\n1:23:14.800 --> 1:23:16.720\n where the cosmic photons are brightest,\n\n1:23:16.720 --> 1:23:19.920\n in the microwave regime in the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:22.000\n And we're coupling that to a refracting telescope.\n\n1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:23.720\n But your eyes are refracting telescopes.\n\n1:23:23.720 --> 1:23:25.520\n So you are a polarimeter right now.\n\n1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:29.160\n The human eye can actually slightly detect polarization.\n\n1:23:29.160 --> 1:23:31.840\n But otherwise, it mainly detects its intensity of light\n\n1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:32.440\n and the color.\n\n1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:34.960\n That's what we call color and intensity, brightness.\n\n1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:37.160\n So you're devising an instrument that's\n\n1:23:37.160 --> 1:23:38.840\n very precisely measuring that polarization.\n\n1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:39.920\n Exactly.\n\n1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:42.680\n And doing so in the microwave region with detectors\n\n1:23:42.680 --> 1:23:46.080\n not made of biological human retina cells,\n\n1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:49.840\n but of superconductors and things called bolometers.\n\n1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:52.360\n And this has to be done at temperatures\n\n1:23:52.360 --> 1:23:55.120\n close to absolute zero under vacuum conditions\n\n1:23:55.120 --> 1:23:58.640\n one billionth of the pressure we feel here at sea level.\n\n1:23:58.640 --> 1:24:01.320\n So why is it that this kind of device\n\n1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:03.160\n could win a Nobel Prize?\n\n1:24:03.160 --> 1:24:05.920\n So when the CMB was discovered, it\n\n1:24:05.920 --> 1:24:07.360\n was discovered serendipitously.\n\n1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:11.560\n There were two radio astronomers working at the time\n\n1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:13.040\n at Bell Laboratories.\n\n1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:14.600\n Now, why would Bell Laboratories be\n\n1:24:14.600 --> 1:24:16.120\n employing radio astronomers?\n\n1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:19.560\n Bell Laboratories was kind of like Apple,\n\n1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:21.920\n or it was like a think tank, or it was Google.\n\n1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:23.080\n Let's say it was like Google.\n\n1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:26.760\n Google has Google X. It has this thing and that thing, right?\n\n1:24:26.760 --> 1:24:28.680\n So they were working there.\n\n1:24:28.680 --> 1:24:31.480\n But imagine if Google was employing radio astronomers.\n\n1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:32.920\n They were actively recruiting them.\n\n1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:33.920\n Why would they do that?\n\n1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:36.480\n Well, it turns out that was the beginning in the 1960s,\n\n1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:39.160\n was the first commercial satellite\n\n1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:41.040\n launch for communication.\n\n1:24:41.040 --> 1:24:44.400\n And so Bell Labs, which would later become the telephone\n\n1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:47.280\n part of AT&T, the early telephone company,\n\n1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:50.520\n later invent the first cell phone the year I was born.\n\n1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:53.200\n And they would take that, 1946, and they\n\n1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:56.000\n would take that telescope technology\n\n1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.520\n that radio astronomers had developed,\n\n1:24:58.520 --> 1:25:00.560\n and they would use that to see if they\n\n1:25:00.560 --> 1:25:02.680\n could improve the signal to noise of the satellites\n\n1:25:02.680 --> 1:25:03.600\n that they were seeing.\n\n1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:05.040\n And they found they couldn't.\n\n1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:07.360\n They found that they could not improve the signal to noise\n\n1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:10.160\n ratio of the first telecommunication satellite.\n\n1:25:10.160 --> 1:25:13.280\n It was like the equivalent to one kilobit per second modem.\n\n1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:16.440\n They were bouncing signals from the West Coast\n\n1:25:16.440 --> 1:25:18.320\n up to the satellite, bouncing it down,\n\n1:25:18.320 --> 1:25:21.360\n landing it in New Jersey, of all places,\n\n1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:25.160\n in northern New Jersey, Holmdell, New Jersey.\n\n1:25:25.160 --> 1:25:27.480\n And these radio astronomers couldn't get rid of the signal.\n\n1:25:27.480 --> 1:25:30.200\n So they said, well, New Jersey's not far from New York.\n\n1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:31.600\n Let's see if the signal's coming from New York.\n\n1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:33.040\n No, not coming from New York.\n\n1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:34.280\n Let's see if it changes with the year.\n\n1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:35.400\n Maybe it's coming from the galaxy,\n\n1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:38.680\n which was also discovered there by Jansky in 1930 something.\n\n1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:41.480\n So in not being able to reduce the signal\n\n1:25:41.480 --> 1:25:45.120\n or increase the signal to noise ratio, the noise was not good.\n\n1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:46.720\n They knew the signal was right.\n\n1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:48.120\n They couldn't get rid of the noise.\n\n1:25:48.120 --> 1:25:50.040\n And there was excess noise over the model that\n\n1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:52.080\n had not only been predicted by them,\n\n1:25:52.080 --> 1:25:54.080\n but had been measured by a previous guy, a guy\n\n1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:55.760\n by the name of Edward Ohm.\n\n1:25:55.760 --> 1:25:57.680\n He measured the same signal, found\n\n1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:00.320\n that there was this hiss of static, of radio static\n\n1:26:00.320 --> 1:26:02.000\n that he could not get rid of, that had\n\n1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:04.000\n a value of about 3 Kelvin.\n\n1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:04.800\n So you can translate.\n\n1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:07.520\n Remember I said, if you take a radio telescope\n\n1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:10.560\n and you point it at an object that's hot,\n\n1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:12.040\n the radio telescope's detector will\n\n1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:14.120\n get to the same temperature as the object.\n\n1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:16.120\n It's a principle of radio thermodynamics.\n\n1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:17.480\n So it's a really interesting thing.\n\n1:26:17.480 --> 1:26:18.320\n It's a thermometer.\n\n1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:20.320\n You can stick it into Jupiter from here on Earth.\n\n1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:21.520\n It's amazing.\n\n1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:24.560\n And so we in radio astronomy characterize our signal\n\n1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:27.640\n not by its intensity, but by its temperature.\n\n1:26:27.640 --> 1:26:29.960\n So he found, this guy Edward Ohm, oh, there's\n\n1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:31.120\n this 3 Kelvin signal.\n\n1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:32.280\n I can't get rid of it.\n\n1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:35.000\n It must be I did my error analysis wrong.\n\n1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.720\n And I would give him an F if he was one of my first year\n\n1:26:37.720 --> 1:26:38.840\n students.\n\n1:26:38.840 --> 1:26:41.560\n But he's just attributed to lack of understanding.\n\n1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:43.800\n These other guys, Penzias and Wilson,\n\n1:26:43.800 --> 1:26:46.320\n who are also radio astronomers, they said, no,\n\n1:26:46.320 --> 1:26:49.280\n let's build another experiment, put that inside\n\n1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:53.000\n of our telescope, and do what's called calibration.\n\n1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:56.800\n Inject a known source of signal every second that\n\n1:26:56.800 --> 1:26:58.760\n has a temperature of about 4 Kelvin,\n\n1:26:58.760 --> 1:27:00.300\n because the signal they're trying to get rid of\n\n1:27:00.300 --> 1:27:01.480\n is about 3 Kelvin.\n\n1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:02.920\n And you want to have it as close as possible\n\n1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:04.840\n to the pernicious signal as possible.\n\n1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:06.320\n They did that once a second.\n\n1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:07.560\n So they got billions of measurements,\n\n1:27:07.560 --> 1:27:08.840\n millions of measurements over the course\n\n1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:11.280\n of several months, years, and even,\n\n1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:13.040\n by the end of, you know, millions of measurements\n\n1:27:13.040 --> 1:27:14.520\n for sure.\n\n1:27:14.520 --> 1:27:16.320\n And they found they couldn't get rid of it either,\n\n1:27:16.320 --> 1:27:20.400\n but they measured it was exactly 2.7265 degrees Kelvin.\n\n1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:24.480\n So how does having a 4 Kelvin source,\n\n1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:26.560\n how does the calibration work, just out of curiosity?\n\n1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:27.400\n It could be larger.\n\n1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:29.120\n Imagine like you're trying to calibrate the microphone.\n\n1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:31.260\n Like you could do it with like a really loud sound,\n\n1:27:31.260 --> 1:27:33.560\n but the gain would start to compress.\n\n1:27:33.560 --> 1:27:36.000\n So there are amplifiers downstream from the detector\n\n1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.640\n in every experiment that I've ever worked on.\n\n1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:41.400\n And they only have a linear region over a very small region.\n\n1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:43.360\n And you want to keep it as linear as possible.\n\n1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:45.160\n That means you want, if you're trying to get rid of it,\n\n1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:47.080\n you're trying to compare like a voice,\n\n1:27:47.080 --> 1:27:49.600\n and you're trying to compare that to a jet engine,\n\n1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:52.520\n it's not going to be as easy on the amplifiers\n\n1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:55.960\n as getting a slightly loud gong or something, you know.\n\n1:27:55.960 --> 1:27:59.160\n So the idea of the noise is present in both?\n\n1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:00.400\n There's noise present in both.\n\n1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:02.320\n And you measure, what they did is\n\n1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:03.880\n they made a separate measurement just\n\n1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:06.200\n of the calibration system, which they measured\n\n1:28:06.200 --> 1:28:07.160\n exactly very well.\n\n1:28:07.160 --> 1:28:09.320\n 4 Kelvin is the temperature of a liquid helium.\n\n1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:11.480\n That's a temperature that's not going to change.\n\n1:28:11.480 --> 1:28:12.360\n And it's certainly not going to change\n\n1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:14.160\n over a time scale of one second.\n\n1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:16.080\n And so they could compare unknown signal,\n\n1:28:16.080 --> 1:28:17.760\n known signal, unknown signal, known signal,\n\n1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:18.960\n like a scale, like a balance.\n\n1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:20.360\n So another way to think about it is like this.\n\n1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:22.520\n You've seen these Libra kind of balances,\n\n1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:24.400\n where you put two weights in a pan, right?\n\n1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:27.040\n What happens if you put like a one ounce weight on one side\n\n1:28:27.040 --> 1:28:28.440\n and a 20 kilogram weight in the other?\n\n1:28:28.440 --> 1:28:30.200\n You don't get any measurement, right?\n\n1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:32.320\n You do get kind of a measurement if they're close in weight.\n\n1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:33.760\n That's why they use 4 Kelvin.\n\n1:28:33.760 --> 1:28:36.400\n Got it, but just to linger on the fact\n\n1:28:36.400 --> 1:28:38.240\n that there's a romantic element to the fact\n\n1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:41.200\n that you're arriving at the same temperature.\n\n1:28:41.200 --> 1:28:42.040\n That's kind of fascinating.\n\n1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:43.640\n And you measuring stuff in terms of,\n\n1:28:43.640 --> 1:28:45.640\n you're measuring signal in terms of temperature\n\n1:28:45.640 --> 1:28:46.840\n at the source.\n\n1:28:46.840 --> 1:28:47.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:49.440\n So you get to, I mean, there's something\n\n1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:51.220\n about temperature that's intimate.\n\n1:28:51.220 --> 1:28:52.060\n Yeah.\n\n1:28:52.060 --> 1:28:52.880\n It's cool.\n\n1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:55.120\n Yeah, especially since, you know, all life\n\n1:28:55.120 --> 1:28:57.560\n is basically, you know, conversion of energy\n\n1:28:57.560 --> 1:28:58.920\n and trying to control entropy,\n\n1:28:58.920 --> 1:29:01.160\n which is then related to thermodynamics\n\n1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:02.600\n exactly in that way.\n\n1:29:02.600 --> 1:29:06.680\n And this is very crucial kind of thing to do in science\n\n1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:08.640\n because they weren't looking for the signal.\n\n1:29:08.640 --> 1:29:10.180\n They found it accidentally,\n\n1:29:10.180 --> 1:29:12.720\n these two scientists, Penzias and Wilson.\n\n1:29:12.720 --> 1:29:15.160\n And I like to think that those kinds of discoveries\n\n1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:16.540\n are the purest in science.\n\n1:29:16.540 --> 1:29:19.080\n Like when you see something, Isaac Asimov once said,\n\n1:29:19.080 --> 1:29:22.260\n like the most important reaction as a scientist is not,\n\n1:29:22.260 --> 1:29:26.440\n Eureka, which means in Greek, as you know, I have found it.\n\n1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:29.060\n No, he said, no, he said like, that's weird.\n\n1:29:29.060 --> 1:29:30.720\n Like that's a much better reaction\n\n1:29:30.720 --> 1:29:31.880\n or that's freaking cool.\n\n1:29:31.880 --> 1:29:34.760\n Like that's a scientist, not like, oh, I found one.\n\n1:29:34.760 --> 1:29:35.580\n Because.\n\n1:29:35.580 --> 1:29:36.420\n Surprise.\n\n1:29:36.420 --> 1:29:37.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:38.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:38.080 --> 1:29:38.920\n Because if you find what you're gonna find,\n\n1:29:38.920 --> 1:29:43.000\n that's what leads us susceptible to confirmation bias,\n\n1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:44.720\n which is deadly inside, you know,\n\n1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:46.240\n as close to deadly as possible.\n\n1:29:46.240 --> 1:29:47.960\n So how does that take us to something\n\n1:29:47.960 --> 1:29:51.120\n that's potentially worthy of a Nobel Prize?\n\n1:29:51.120 --> 1:29:54.240\n So Penzias and Wilson weren't looking for a signal.\n\n1:29:54.240 --> 1:29:56.500\n They ended up discovering the heat leftover\n\n1:29:56.500 --> 1:30:01.500\n from the fusion of helium from hydrogen, et cetera.\n\n1:30:01.640 --> 1:30:03.040\n And that was a serendipitous discovery.\n\n1:30:03.040 --> 1:30:04.800\n They won the Nobel Prize in 1978.\n\n1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:07.640\n It was the first one ever awarded in cosmology.\n\n1:30:07.640 --> 1:30:09.860\n My reasoning is, what if you could explain\n\n1:30:09.860 --> 1:30:11.720\n not only how the elements got formed,\n\n1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:13.820\n but how the whole universe got formed\n\n1:30:13.820 --> 1:30:16.680\n and kill off every other model of science.\n\n1:30:16.680 --> 1:30:19.760\n So if that weren't enough, every scientist, you know,\n\n1:30:19.760 --> 1:30:23.440\n worth his or her salt had told me and Andrew Lang\n\n1:30:23.440 --> 1:30:26.480\n and our colleagues, this is a slam dunk Nobel Prize,\n\n1:30:26.480 --> 1:30:27.820\n if you could do it.\n\n1:30:27.820 --> 1:30:29.820\n Because it was really explaining, again,\n\n1:30:29.820 --> 1:30:31.600\n the stakes of this science is different\n\n1:30:31.600 --> 1:30:33.900\n than like super fluidity, plasma physics.\n\n1:30:33.900 --> 1:30:36.440\n When you talk about the origin of the universe,\n\n1:30:36.440 --> 1:30:37.880\n it ties into everything.\n\n1:30:37.880 --> 1:30:41.860\n It ties into philosophy, theology.\n\n1:30:41.860 --> 1:30:45.480\n You realize if Paul Steinhardt is correct,\n\n1:30:45.480 --> 1:30:47.280\n that the Bible can't be correct.\n\n1:30:47.280 --> 1:30:49.360\n In other words, where the Bible is correct now\n\n1:30:49.360 --> 1:30:52.120\n isn't falsified, if you like, if you believe it.\n\n1:30:52.120 --> 1:30:54.800\n I never use the Bible as a science book, obviously.\n\n1:30:54.800 --> 1:30:57.820\n But the Bible speaks of a singular beginning.\n\n1:30:57.820 --> 1:31:00.600\n What if you knew for sure the universe was not singular?\n\n1:31:00.600 --> 1:31:03.480\n It would be more like the cosmology of Akhenaten\n\n1:31:03.480 --> 1:31:07.120\n and Egyptians than the biblical Torah, Old Testament,\n\n1:31:07.120 --> 1:31:08.720\n if you will, narrative.\n\n1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:11.400\n So in my mind, the stakes could not be higher.\n\n1:31:11.400 --> 1:31:14.140\n And again, it's not an offense, because we need plasma physics.\n\n1:31:14.140 --> 1:31:17.560\n We need every type of physics except maybe biophysics.\n\n1:31:17.560 --> 1:31:20.320\n We literally use every branch of physics, thermodynamics,\n\n1:31:20.320 --> 1:31:22.200\n superconductivity, quantum mechanics,\n\n1:31:22.200 --> 1:31:24.260\n all that goes into our understanding\n\n1:31:24.260 --> 1:31:25.000\n of the instrument.\n\n1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:27.800\n And even further, if you want to understand the theory that\n\n1:31:27.800 --> 1:31:29.760\n predicts the signal that we purport to measure.\n\n1:31:29.760 --> 1:31:34.040\n So I rationalize that if Penzias and Wilson won the Nobel\n\n1:31:34.040 --> 1:31:37.220\n Prize for this, if Hulse and Taylor won the Nobel\n\n1:31:37.220 --> 1:31:39.760\n Prize for indirectly detecting gravitational waves,\n\n1:31:39.760 --> 1:31:43.500\n this is decades before LIGO, by me detecting\n\n1:31:43.500 --> 1:31:46.880\n gravitational waves indirectly, detecting how the universe\n\n1:31:46.880 --> 1:31:50.840\n began, detecting the origin of the initial conditions\n\n1:31:50.840 --> 1:31:52.720\n for the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which\n\n1:31:52.720 --> 1:31:55.080\n won the Nobel Prize in 1983.\n\n1:31:55.080 --> 1:31:57.920\n These are like five Nobel Prizes potentially.\n\n1:31:57.920 --> 1:32:00.200\n For that reason, it seemed as close\n\n1:32:00.200 --> 1:32:02.440\n as you could possibly get to being a slam dunk,\n\n1:32:02.440 --> 1:32:06.160\n to outdo what my father did, to do really this impossible.\n\n1:32:06.160 --> 1:32:10.720\n And at that time, Lex, again, it sounds weird.\n\n1:32:10.720 --> 1:32:15.920\n Because people are like, oh, you still want the Nobel Prize.\n\n1:32:15.920 --> 1:32:16.880\n You're still like greedy.\n\n1:32:16.880 --> 1:32:19.120\n And look, you wrote another book about it.\n\n1:32:19.120 --> 1:32:19.720\n And I always joke.\n\n1:32:19.720 --> 1:32:21.360\n I'm like, well, if you want to see if I'm a hypocrite,\n\n1:32:21.360 --> 1:32:23.880\n just get them to give me the Nobel Prize in literature.\n\n1:32:23.880 --> 1:32:26.560\n And if I accept it, then I'm a hypocrite.\n\n1:32:26.560 --> 1:32:29.200\n Oh, wait, well, we'll get to your current feelings\n\n1:32:29.200 --> 1:32:33.040\n on the Nobel Prize in terms of hypocrite and so on.\n\n1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:35.560\n So there's this ambition.\n\n1:32:35.560 --> 1:32:38.880\n Let's say this device, this kind of signal\n\n1:32:38.880 --> 1:32:40.560\n could unlock many of the mysteries\n\n1:32:40.560 --> 1:32:42.240\n about the early universe.\n\n1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:44.240\n And so there's excitement there.\n\n1:32:44.240 --> 1:32:47.040\n So let's take it then further.\n\n1:32:47.040 --> 1:32:50.240\n I mean, there's a human story here of a bit of heartbreak.\n\n1:32:50.240 --> 1:32:54.560\n Not only was this possibly worth a Nobel Prize,\n\n1:32:54.560 --> 1:32:57.200\n if the Nobel Prize was given,\n\n1:32:57.200 --> 1:32:59.680\n you were excluded from the list of three\n\n1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:01.520\n that would get the Nobel Prize.\n\n1:33:01.520 --> 1:33:04.520\n So why were you excluded?\n\n1:33:04.520 --> 1:33:07.600\n Maybe that's a place to tell the story of Bicep 2.\n\n1:33:07.600 --> 1:33:10.200\n Yeah, so Bicep 2, like iPhones,\n\n1:33:10.200 --> 1:33:12.040\n or I know you're an Android fanboy,\n\n1:33:12.040 --> 1:33:14.480\n but every year, they get a little bit better.\n\n1:33:14.480 --> 1:33:15.680\n They get more megapixels.\n\n1:33:15.680 --> 1:33:19.680\n They get more optics, triple X zoom, whatever, OK?\n\n1:33:19.680 --> 1:33:21.520\n We upgraded our detectors as well.\n\n1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:23.560\n The initial detectors were based on what\n\n1:33:23.560 --> 1:33:24.880\n are called semiconductors.\n\n1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:26.800\n They have certain properties that\n\n1:33:26.800 --> 1:33:29.320\n make them very difficult to replicate at scale.\n\n1:33:29.320 --> 1:33:32.120\n And we wanted to make them into superconductors, which\n\n1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:35.360\n had a virtue that you could then mass produce them.\n\n1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:36.680\n Why superconductors?\n\n1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:38.320\n Well, again, we're measuring heat.\n\n1:33:38.320 --> 1:33:40.240\n So one thing about a superconductor\n\n1:33:40.240 --> 1:33:43.360\n is that it transitions from some finite resistance\n\n1:33:43.360 --> 1:33:47.560\n to zero resistance over a very short span of temperature\n\n1:33:47.560 --> 1:33:48.400\n range.\n\n1:33:48.400 --> 1:33:51.360\n That means you can use that very short span dependency\n\n1:33:51.360 --> 1:33:54.920\n as an accurate and sensitive and precise thermometer.\n\n1:33:54.920 --> 1:33:56.960\n And so my brilliant colleagues around the world,\n\n1:33:56.960 --> 1:33:59.360\n in this case, Jamie Bok, and nowadays, Suzanne Staggs\n\n1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:02.560\n at Princeton, they are just exquisitely\n\n1:34:02.560 --> 1:34:05.840\n making these sensors, tens of thousands of them.\n\n1:34:05.840 --> 1:34:07.960\n The initial Bicep 1 instrument, of course,\n\n1:34:07.960 --> 1:34:12.240\n we just call the Bicep, that only had 98 detectors.\n\n1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:15.880\n Simon's Observatory is going to have 100 times more just\n\n1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:17.800\n in one of our four telescopes.\n\n1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:20.840\n We're going to have 60,000 detectors operating\n\n1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:24.520\n full time at 0.1 degree above absolute zero\n\n1:34:24.520 --> 1:34:25.600\n in the Atacama Desert.\n\n1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:26.440\n We'll get there.\n\n1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:30.200\n But in the case of getting back to what Bicep did,\n\n1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:32.600\n we upgraded and made Bicep 2.\n\n1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:37.920\n In January 2010, we had just installed\n\n1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:42.320\n in the exact same location at the South Pole,\n\n1:34:42.320 --> 1:34:45.040\n in the same building, which is ominously called the Dark\n\n1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:49.840\n Sector Laboratory, DSL, still operating to this very day,\n\n1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:54.160\n we installed a new receiver on the same platform as before.\n\n1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:57.600\n It had very similar identical optics, cryogenics, vacuum,\n\n1:34:57.600 --> 1:35:02.040\n everything, except it went from 98 detectors to 512 detectors.\n\n1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:05.440\n So almost an order of magnitude, very substantial upgrade.\n\n1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:06.840\n And it had certain other features\n\n1:35:06.840 --> 1:35:11.040\n that made it even more powerful than just a naive factor of 5.\n\n1:35:11.040 --> 1:35:12.680\n And then we started observing with that.\n\n1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:14.120\n And we knew we'd have years to go,\n\n1:35:14.120 --> 1:35:15.320\n and maybe we'd never see anything.\n\n1:35:15.320 --> 1:35:17.560\n Again, we're looking for these tiny little reverberations\n\n1:35:17.560 --> 1:35:19.200\n in the fabric of space time produced\n\n1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:21.720\n close to the origin of the universe as we could ever\n\n1:35:21.720 --> 1:35:23.000\n get to.\n\n1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:24.360\n So I was playing a role in that.\n\n1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:28.200\n Obviously, it had upgraded my version of the original idea\n\n1:35:28.200 --> 1:35:32.480\n that I had had for BICEP along with Andrew Lang.\n\n1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:37.040\n And in January of 2010, I was at a meeting at UC Berkeley,\n\n1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:39.120\n and I got a call from Andrew Lang's,\n\n1:35:39.120 --> 1:35:41.760\n or I was in a meeting with Andrew Lang's thesis advisor,\n\n1:35:41.760 --> 1:35:43.960\n Paul Richards at UC Berkeley.\n\n1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:45.880\n And he said that Andrew was dead.\n\n1:35:45.880 --> 1:35:48.920\n He had taken his life by suicide.\n\n1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:51.520\n And this is a man, and I had already lost my father\n\n1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:54.880\n at this point in 2010, but he was like a father figure\n\n1:35:54.880 --> 1:35:55.760\n to me, Andrew.\n\n1:35:55.760 --> 1:35:58.600\n He would give me advice on marriage,\n\n1:35:58.600 --> 1:36:02.140\n on how I should be with my kids, and what\n\n1:36:02.140 --> 1:36:03.640\n was the most important way to move\n\n1:36:03.640 --> 1:36:04.800\n through the academic ladder.\n\n1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:08.560\n Again, he was predinaturally suited to win the Nobel Prize.\n\n1:36:08.560 --> 1:36:10.800\n Everyone always thought he would win it.\n\n1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:12.600\n If he were alive, he still could win it.\n\n1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:14.280\n In fact, his wife, or his ex wife,\n\n1:36:14.280 --> 1:36:17.760\n won it, Frances Arnold, in 2018.\n\n1:36:17.760 --> 1:36:22.880\n And it was this power couple, and it destroyed me\n\n1:36:22.880 --> 1:36:27.440\n for a long time, because he was just this magical person.\n\n1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:31.360\n I mean, I couldn't conceive of my career, my life,\n\n1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:35.280\n even these aspects of raising kids and being married\n\n1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:37.020\n without him.\n\n1:36:37.020 --> 1:36:40.880\n And to do it in that way, it felt like, again,\n\n1:36:40.880 --> 1:36:44.160\n he's got kids, and I feel terrible for them, obviously.\n\n1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:45.480\n But it did feel like a betrayal.\n\n1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:47.160\n I mean, I'm just being honest with you.\n\n1:36:47.160 --> 1:36:50.240\n It felt like, why the f did you not reach out?\n\n1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:52.720\n I thought we were close, and I couldn't.\n\n1:36:52.720 --> 1:36:54.240\n I told him everything, and I felt\n\n1:36:54.240 --> 1:36:56.400\n like he had told me everything.\n\n1:36:56.400 --> 1:36:57.480\n And now he was gone.\n\n1:36:57.480 --> 1:36:59.940\n And then, inevitably, we had to keep running the instrument.\n\n1:36:59.940 --> 1:37:01.900\n I mean, there's millions of dollars invested,\n\n1:37:01.900 --> 1:37:05.720\n careers at stake, young people working tremendously hard.\n\n1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:06.640\n And then here we were.\n\n1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:08.320\n And who's going to take over the lead?\n\n1:37:08.320 --> 1:37:10.920\n He was the lead of the project at Caltech.\n\n1:37:10.920 --> 1:37:14.140\n And then it turned out that the other collaborators,\n\n1:37:14.140 --> 1:37:16.640\n with whom I had been working for years and shared a lot of ups\n\n1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:19.820\n and downs with as well, they had decided\n\n1:37:19.820 --> 1:37:21.960\n to form a collaboration in which I was no longer\n\n1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:23.480\n the principal investigator.\n\n1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:25.560\n I was no longer one of the co principal investigators,\n\n1:37:25.560 --> 1:37:26.920\n as I was on Bicep 1.\n\n1:37:26.920 --> 1:37:29.560\n So I continued on Bicep 1 as the co leader of it,\n\n1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:31.040\n but not on Bicep 2.\n\n1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:34.600\n And obviously, that was pretty painful.\n\n1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:36.280\n This is all happening at the same time\n\n1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:40.360\n as you lose this father figure.\n\n1:37:40.360 --> 1:37:45.200\n Now there's this one betrayal in a way,\n\n1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:47.400\n and then there's another, or something\n\n1:37:47.400 --> 1:37:48.800\n that feels like a betrayal.\n\n1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:51.840\n Yeah, and he had been the only one\n\n1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:54.800\n looking out for my interest in the new experiment.\n\n1:37:54.800 --> 1:37:57.480\n I had moved from Caltech to UC San Diego,\n\n1:37:57.480 --> 1:37:59.200\n and there were other postdocs in the mix,\n\n1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:01.240\n all of whom had come there to work with him\n\n1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:03.740\n to get the approbation that would then lead\n\n1:38:03.740 --> 1:38:06.800\n to their careers taking off, as it did for mine.\n\n1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:09.160\n And so there was a competition.\n\n1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:13.320\n Science is not free from egos and competition\n\n1:38:13.320 --> 1:38:15.880\n and desires, rightfully or wrongfully,\n\n1:38:15.880 --> 1:38:17.480\n for credit and attribution.\n\n1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:20.040\n Was he the source of strength and confidence\n\n1:38:20.040 --> 1:38:22.040\n for you as a scientist, as a man?\n\n1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:26.280\n I mean, we're kind of alone in this world.\n\n1:38:26.280 --> 1:38:28.480\n When you take on difficult things,\n\n1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:31.760\n we often kind of grasp at a few folks\n\n1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:33.280\n that give us strength.\n\n1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:34.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:37.320\n Was he basically your only source of strength\n\n1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:39.320\n in this whole journey, like primarily\n\n1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:41.840\n in terms of this close knit?\n\n1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:43.600\n As a scientist, there were really two.\n\n1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:46.080\n There was one, this Russian cosmologist,\n\n1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:48.520\n Alexander Polnareff, who thankfully is very much alive.\n\n1:38:48.520 --> 1:38:51.080\n He was at Queen Mary University.\n\n1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:52.560\n Now he's retired.\n\n1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:56.040\n He was kind of a theoretical, cosmological father to me.\n\n1:38:56.040 --> 1:38:58.760\n And then Andrew was this counterpoint\n\n1:38:58.760 --> 1:39:02.600\n that was teaching me, you need to have a brand as a scientist.\n\n1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:04.040\n Every scientist has a brand.\n\n1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:05.640\n And some of them don't protect it.\n\n1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:07.880\n Some of them don't burnish it.\n\n1:39:07.880 --> 1:39:10.000\n But some of the skills about being a scientist\n\n1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.360\n we don't teach our students involve,\n\n1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:16.800\n how do you cultivate a scientific persona?\n\n1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:18.760\n And he was the exemplar for that,\n\n1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:22.520\n in addition to being the avuncular father figure type\n\n1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:26.480\n character that really was the person I would talk to.\n\n1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:29.080\n I had issues with when I had issues with my own students.\n\n1:39:29.080 --> 1:39:30.640\n And he would tell me how those were.\n\n1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:34.480\n And he would tell me his misgivings about people\n\n1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:36.600\n that he worked with or things in his personal life.\n\n1:39:36.600 --> 1:39:39.160\n And it was devastating.\n\n1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:40.680\n But again, who the hell am I?\n\n1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:42.280\n I'm not his kid.\n\n1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:44.440\n His kid's lost father.\n\n1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:46.760\n So I feel guilty talking about it in that sense,\n\n1:39:46.760 --> 1:39:48.480\n but it's just a reality.\n\n1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:50.640\n Well, there is something that's not often talked about\n\n1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:55.040\n is people who collaborate on scientific efforts.\n\n1:39:55.040 --> 1:39:58.680\n I mean, that's, I don't, again, don't wanna compare,\n\n1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:03.520\n but sometimes when the collaborations are truly great,\n\n1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:08.520\n it sounds similar as when veterans talk about\n\n1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:11.360\n their time serving together.\n\n1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:12.920\n There's a bond that's formed.\n\n1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:15.960\n So like comparing family and this kind of thing is,\n\n1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:19.920\n you know, it's not productive,\n\n1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:23.920\n but the depth of the bond is nevertheless real\n\n1:40:25.760 --> 1:40:28.200\n because you're taking on something,\n\n1:40:28.200 --> 1:40:29.800\n you're taking on the impossible.\n\n1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:32.520\n You're trying to achieve something,\n\n1:40:32.520 --> 1:40:33.960\n sort of like there's this darkness,\n\n1:40:33.960 --> 1:40:37.640\n this fog of mystery that we're all surrounded by,\n\n1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:40.480\n which is what the human condition is.\n\n1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:42.880\n And you are like grasping at hope\n\n1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:44.720\n through the tools of science.\n\n1:40:44.720 --> 1:40:46.480\n And you're doing that together\n\n1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:50.080\n with like a confidence you probably should not have,\n\n1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:51.520\n but you're boldly pushing through.\n\n1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:56.520\n And then for him to take his own life,\n\n1:40:57.640 --> 1:41:02.640\n can I ask you about this kind of moment that combined,\n\n1:41:02.880 --> 1:41:03.920\n I don't wanna say betrayal,\n\n1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:05.920\n but perhaps the feeling of betrayal\n\n1:41:05.920 --> 1:41:09.360\n that Bicep 2 kind of goes on without you,\n\n1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:11.600\n even though you're part of it,\n\n1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:13.560\n you're not part of the leadership group.\n\n1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:17.280\n Can you describe those low points?\n\n1:41:18.640 --> 1:41:19.840\n Was there a depression?\n\n1:41:19.840 --> 1:41:23.000\n Or was there a crumbling of confidence?\n\n1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:26.280\n Yeah, I mean, it was so wrapped up\n\n1:41:26.280 --> 1:41:28.960\n with my identity as a person.\n\n1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:31.200\n You know, like there's only a few different ways\n\n1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:34.800\n to have identity unless you're unhealthy psychologically.\n\n1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:37.120\n One of them for scientists is often that they're a scientist\n\n1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:39.160\n and that sometimes is their primary identity.\n\n1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:41.920\n Now I've got other husband and father,\n\n1:41:41.920 --> 1:41:44.840\n but at that time that was my identity.\n\n1:41:44.840 --> 1:41:47.440\n So to have that kind of taken away,\n\n1:41:48.440 --> 1:41:52.960\n you know what, it reminded me of being kind of adopted\n\n1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:55.840\n in a sense like the one who created me\n\n1:41:55.840 --> 1:41:58.360\n or that I had played a role in my life,\n\n1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:00.800\n that he abandoned me in the sense,\n\n1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:02.640\n it felt like these people are abandoning me.\n\n1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:04.320\n And the only thing I'd correct about the analogy\n\n1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:07.080\n that you use is like in the war,\n\n1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:08.680\n they're all working for common good.\n\n1:42:08.680 --> 1:42:11.640\n It's not like I want to get the most kills.\n\n1:42:11.640 --> 1:42:13.400\n I compare it more to like a band,\n\n1:42:13.400 --> 1:42:16.440\n like think about the Beatles and what they did.\n\n1:42:16.440 --> 1:42:20.160\n And then they ripped apart because of egos, credit,\n\n1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:21.240\n they had solo careers,\n\n1:42:21.240 --> 1:42:25.360\n they had relations with their intimates and so forth.\n\n1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:27.840\n And there it's not only for the common good,\n\n1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:30.200\n there is more of a zero sum aspect.\n\n1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:33.960\n Like I would say, science is an infinite game.\n\n1:42:33.960 --> 1:42:35.840\n You can't win science.\n\n1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:37.440\n You never get to the, oh, we won science.\n\n1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:38.920\n And even the Nobel prize, they don't feel like,\n\n1:42:38.920 --> 1:42:39.760\n oh, we're done.\n\n1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:41.360\n They feel like a lot of times they're imposters\n\n1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:43.000\n even to that day.\n\n1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:47.920\n However, science is made up of a lot of finite games\n\n1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:50.000\n where there is only one winner for tenure.\n\n1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:51.280\n There is only three winners\n\n1:42:51.280 --> 1:42:53.880\n or only three winners for the Nobel prize.\n\n1:42:53.880 --> 1:42:56.040\n And because of that, I think it's heterodox\n\n1:42:56.040 --> 1:42:59.200\n and it's very confusing, especially there's no guide.\n\n1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:00.800\n I never got a guide how to be a professor,\n\n1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:02.560\n how to teach, how to lead a research group,\n\n1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:05.040\n how to deal with the death of an advisor,\n\n1:43:05.040 --> 1:43:08.520\n how to deal with an unruly graduate student or two.\n\n1:43:08.520 --> 1:43:09.960\n So we're all like reinventing it,\n\n1:43:09.960 --> 1:43:12.440\n which is kind of ironic and insane if you think about it.\n\n1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:14.360\n Cause the academic system that I am a part of\n\n1:43:14.360 --> 1:43:16.880\n and you are a part of is a thousand years old.\n\n1:43:16.880 --> 1:43:21.720\n Dates back to Bologna, Northern Italy, 1088 or so.\n\n1:43:21.720 --> 1:43:24.240\n First universities were established.\n\n1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:26.560\n And very little has changed.\n\n1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:28.920\n There's some guy or gal scratching a rock\n\n1:43:28.920 --> 1:43:31.960\n on another piece of rock and lecturing in front.\n\n1:43:31.960 --> 1:43:33.860\n And there's only one better aspect nowadays\n\n1:43:33.860 --> 1:43:36.920\n is that back then the students could go on strike\n\n1:43:36.920 --> 1:43:38.300\n if they didn't like the professor\n\n1:43:38.300 --> 1:43:39.960\n and then he or she wouldn't get paid.\n\n1:43:39.960 --> 1:43:42.200\n Probably mostly it was he's back then.\n\n1:43:42.200 --> 1:43:44.440\n Nowadays that barbaric process has been replaced\n\n1:43:44.440 --> 1:43:45.880\n by tenure, so okay.\n\n1:43:47.200 --> 1:43:50.120\n But no, it was a definite kind of feeling of the rug\n\n1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:52.120\n getting pulled out from underneath me\n\n1:43:52.120 --> 1:43:55.440\n because he was like my consigliore.\n\n1:43:55.440 --> 1:43:59.060\n He was a guy I sought counsel and counseled me\n\n1:43:59.060 --> 1:44:00.800\n and he's dead.\n\n1:44:00.800 --> 1:44:02.460\n And I felt like there is no one\n\n1:44:02.460 --> 1:44:05.560\n who's gonna honor the agreements that we had.\n\n1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:07.160\n And he was a very soulful person.\n\n1:44:07.160 --> 1:44:09.600\n He was so much better at being a scientist\n\n1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:11.440\n than I could ever be.\n\n1:44:11.440 --> 1:44:14.980\n And just a loss for the cosmos, it just really hurt.\n\n1:44:14.980 --> 1:44:17.800\n And I thought, oh, it's so sad\n\n1:44:17.800 --> 1:44:19.960\n cause he could have won the Nobel Prize.\n\n1:44:19.960 --> 1:44:21.440\n I don't think like that anymore.\n\n1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:23.200\n First I think about his kids.\n\n1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:25.520\n Felt at first now there goes my chance\n\n1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:26.500\n at winning a Nobel Prize.\n\n1:44:26.500 --> 1:44:28.840\n And hence the title of the book was like,\n\n1:44:28.840 --> 1:44:31.120\n I knew I would not win the Nobel Prize.\n\n1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:33.000\n It also means that there's parts of the Nobel Prize\n\n1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:34.200\n that have to be done away with.\n\n1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:35.240\n It's a double entendre.\n\n1:44:35.240 --> 1:44:37.480\n Like we need to lose aspects of the Nobel Prize\n\n1:44:37.480 --> 1:44:38.600\n to help science out.\n\n1:44:38.600 --> 1:44:40.040\n We can talk about that a different time.\n\n1:44:40.040 --> 1:44:44.320\n But in the context of like now thinking back on it,\n\n1:44:44.320 --> 1:44:46.220\n that was such a minuscule part of it.\n\n1:44:46.220 --> 1:44:49.240\n Because let's say he did win the Nobel Prize\n\n1:44:49.240 --> 1:44:52.040\n or I did win the, or any of us did.\n\n1:44:52.040 --> 1:44:53.280\n Would that have changed anything?\n\n1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:55.140\n Would that have brought anything back?\n\n1:44:55.140 --> 1:44:58.800\n It's so, we say it's like vanity, it's futility.\n\n1:44:58.800 --> 1:45:03.800\n And I just, for me, the Nobel Prize is like,\n\n1:45:04.120 --> 1:45:06.120\n I don't wanna say it's like insignificant,\n\n1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:07.680\n because obviously it has a lot of power\n\n1:45:07.680 --> 1:45:08.680\n and it has influence.\n\n1:45:08.680 --> 1:45:11.520\n And I went back, I had Neil deGrasse Tyson on my show.\n\n1:45:11.520 --> 1:45:13.040\n I'm gonna name drop, okay?\n\n1:45:13.040 --> 1:45:14.880\n And he prepares.\n\n1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:19.080\n He prepares like a surgeon before doing surgery\n\n1:45:19.080 --> 1:45:20.440\n when he goes on a talk show.\n\n1:45:20.440 --> 1:45:22.880\n So you see him going on Colbert Report.\n\n1:45:22.880 --> 1:45:24.320\n You think, oh, they just have a banter.\n\n1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:25.460\n He's just naturally gifted.\n\n1:45:25.460 --> 1:45:27.120\n No, he said, no, no, no.\n\n1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:29.760\n You say that, you're undermining what he does.\n\n1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:31.280\n What he does is he goes back.\n\n1:45:31.280 --> 1:45:33.680\n He watches the last month of Colbert Reports\n\n1:45:33.680 --> 1:45:35.720\n or whatever it's called, late show.\n\n1:45:35.720 --> 1:45:38.520\n And he says, how long does Steven pause between questions?\n\n1:45:38.520 --> 1:45:41.240\n How long in the news cycle does he go back?\n\n1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:44.200\n What topics has he talked about with people similar to me?\n\n1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:46.600\n So I took Neil and I did that for you.\n\n1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:48.240\n And I look back, how many times has Lex\n\n1:45:48.240 --> 1:45:50.200\n mentioned the words Nobel and prize?\n\n1:45:50.200 --> 1:45:53.440\n And I put it into Google Ngram and out came\n\n1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:58.000\n exactly the same number of times as show episodes\n\n1:45:58.000 --> 1:45:58.960\n as of this moment.\n\n1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:01.680\n So you've said the words Nobel Prize over 240 times.\n\n1:46:01.680 --> 1:46:05.560\n Yeah, I mean, it is so strange as a symbol\n\n1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:08.980\n that kind of unites this whole scientific journey, right?\n\n1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:14.520\n It's so, it's both sad and beautiful\n\n1:46:14.520 --> 1:46:19.520\n that a little prize, a little award, a medal,\n\n1:46:19.800 --> 1:46:21.960\n a little plaque, they'll be most likely forgotten\n\n1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:26.260\n by history completely, some silly list.\n\n1:46:27.720 --> 1:46:31.880\n It's somehow a catalyst for greatness.\n\n1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:36.880\n It resulted in you doing your life's work, the dream of it.\n\n1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:39.720\n Would I have done it without the Nobel Prize?\n\n1:46:39.720 --> 1:46:42.080\n I can't necessarily counterfactually state\n\n1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:43.480\n that that would have happened.\n\n1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:46.040\n So no, it definitely has a place.\n\n1:46:47.480 --> 1:46:50.320\n And for me, it is valuable to think about it.\n\n1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:54.840\n But the level of obsession that academics have about it\n\n1:46:54.840 --> 1:46:58.520\n is really, I think it is almost on balance\n\n1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:00.140\n becoming unhealthy.\n\n1:47:00.140 --> 1:47:03.280\n And again, I have no, I make no truck\n\n1:47:03.280 --> 1:47:04.840\n with the winners of the Nobel Prize.\n\n1:47:04.840 --> 1:47:08.200\n Obviously, now I've had 11 on the show.\n\n1:47:08.200 --> 1:47:10.560\n And to think about the one rule,\n\n1:47:10.560 --> 1:47:13.740\n so by the way, right after the denouement of the story,\n\n1:47:13.740 --> 1:47:15.480\n which I'll get to in a bit,\n\n1:47:15.480 --> 1:47:18.280\n how our dreams went down to dust and ashes,\n\n1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:21.460\n I was asked by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences\n\n1:47:21.460 --> 1:47:25.420\n to nominate the winners of the 2015 Nobel Prize in physics.\n\n1:47:25.420 --> 1:47:27.380\n So like the one that I theoretically\n\n1:47:27.380 --> 1:47:31.460\n could have been eligible to win in 2016, actually,\n\n1:47:31.460 --> 1:47:32.340\n they asked me to nominate.\n\n1:47:32.340 --> 1:47:33.660\n Now imagine if I ask you, Lex,\n\n1:47:33.660 --> 1:47:37.100\n you say, Brian, instead of me inviting myself on the show,\n\n1:47:37.100 --> 1:47:38.620\n if you say, Brian, would you like to come\n\n1:47:38.620 --> 1:47:40.060\n on the Lex Friedman podcast?\n\n1:47:40.060 --> 1:47:42.140\n I say, you know what, Lex?\n\n1:47:42.140 --> 1:47:42.980\n You know that guy Rogan?\n\n1:47:42.980 --> 1:47:44.120\n I think you might know him.\n\n1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:46.020\n Can you introduce him to me?\n\n1:47:46.020 --> 1:47:47.740\n Like, do you imagine how that would feel?\n\n1:47:47.740 --> 1:47:50.020\n Like you'd be like, ah, you know.\n\n1:47:50.020 --> 1:47:51.340\n So I was asked to nominate the winners.\n\n1:47:51.340 --> 1:47:53.420\n And the one rule that they say,\n\n1:47:53.420 --> 1:47:55.860\n of all the rules that Alfred Nobel stipulated,\n\n1:47:55.860 --> 1:47:57.760\n there's only one rule that they maintained.\n\n1:47:57.760 --> 1:47:59.980\n In other words, he said one person can win it\n\n1:47:59.980 --> 1:48:02.960\n for something they discovered in the preceding year\n\n1:48:02.960 --> 1:48:06.140\n that had the greatest benefit to mankind,\n\n1:48:06.140 --> 1:48:07.900\n made the world better, right?\n\n1:48:07.900 --> 1:48:09.540\n None of that was mentioned in the letter.\n\n1:48:09.540 --> 1:48:12.380\n It said many people can win it, worked on long ago.\n\n1:48:12.380 --> 1:48:14.040\n They didn't mention anything in the letter to me,\n\n1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:15.740\n signed by the Secretary General.\n\n1:48:15.740 --> 1:48:16.980\n Nothing about benefiting mankind.\n\n1:48:16.980 --> 1:48:20.220\n They said, just one thing, can't nominate yourself.\n\n1:48:20.220 --> 1:48:22.180\n So none of these guys nominated themselves.\n\n1:48:22.180 --> 1:48:23.820\n Actually, little known fact,\n\n1:48:23.820 --> 1:48:26.440\n they sent that exact letter just to you.\n\n1:48:28.060 --> 1:48:29.940\n That rule was created just for you.\n\n1:48:29.940 --> 1:48:32.860\n That's called the Keating Correlate, yes, exactly.\n\n1:48:32.860 --> 1:48:34.820\n Just to like. Good for them.\n\n1:48:36.140 --> 1:48:37.640\n Rub it in.\n\n1:48:37.640 --> 1:48:39.980\n I mean, in this particular case, of course,\n\n1:48:39.980 --> 1:48:42.380\n there's some weird technicality or whatever,\n\n1:48:42.380 --> 1:48:43.700\n but in this particular case,\n\n1:48:43.700 --> 1:48:47.180\n it's kind of a powerful reminder.\n\n1:48:47.180 --> 1:48:48.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:48.020 --> 1:48:51.360\n That the Nobel Prize leaves a lot of people behind\n\n1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:54.360\n in their stories behind all of that.\n\n1:48:54.360 --> 1:48:55.540\n Yeah, I mean, here's a good example.\n\n1:48:55.540 --> 1:48:57.060\n Again, this is my friend, Barry Barash.\n\n1:48:57.060 --> 1:48:59.260\n He's become like a mentor and a friend.\n\n1:49:00.220 --> 1:49:03.060\n He wrote the foreword to my book, Into the Impossible.\n\n1:49:03.060 --> 1:49:07.060\n He won the Nobel Prize because a different guy died,\n\n1:49:07.060 --> 1:49:09.060\n and he admits it, and he said it.\n\n1:49:09.060 --> 1:49:10.300\n And actually, it's funny with him\n\n1:49:10.300 --> 1:49:13.500\n because I've heard you talk very rhapsodically\n\n1:49:13.500 --> 1:49:15.460\n and lovingly and romantically about,\n\n1:49:15.460 --> 1:49:17.740\n with Harry Kliff and a wonderful podcast with him,\n\n1:49:17.740 --> 1:49:21.220\n by the way, about the LHC and how wonderful it is\n\n1:49:21.220 --> 1:49:23.540\n and how in that we were about to build\n\n1:49:23.540 --> 1:49:27.020\n the superconducting supercollider right here in Texas,\n\n1:49:27.020 --> 1:49:30.320\n and it didn't get built and it got canceled by Congress.\n\n1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:31.240\n And I say to Barry,\n\n1:49:31.240 --> 1:49:33.000\n that was the best thing that ever happened to you.\n\n1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:34.300\n And he's like, what the hell are you talking about?\n\n1:49:34.300 --> 1:49:35.840\n I'm like, if that didn't get canceled,\n\n1:49:35.840 --> 1:49:39.420\n first of all, even though it did get canceled,\n\n1:49:39.420 --> 1:49:41.860\n the Europeans went on to build it themselves,\n\n1:49:41.860 --> 1:49:44.300\n saved the American taxpayers billions of dollars,\n\n1:49:44.300 --> 1:49:46.100\n and we wouldn't have learned anything\n\n1:49:46.100 --> 1:49:48.660\n really substantially new as proven by the fact\n\n1:49:48.660 --> 1:49:50.220\n that as you and Harry talked about,\n\n1:49:50.220 --> 1:49:52.780\n nothing besides the Higgs particle of great note\n\n1:49:52.780 --> 1:49:55.260\n has come out, and actually, he's had a recent paper,\n\n1:49:55.260 --> 1:49:57.660\n but it's been an upper limit along with his collaborators\n\n1:49:57.660 --> 1:50:00.500\n on LHCb experiment that I'm gonna be talking with him about.\n\n1:50:00.500 --> 1:50:02.500\n But the bottom line is it was really built\n\n1:50:02.500 --> 1:50:03.340\n to detect the Higgs.\n\n1:50:03.340 --> 1:50:06.280\n So the SSC, for twice as much money,\n\n1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:07.740\n would have sucked up Barry's career.\n\n1:50:07.740 --> 1:50:09.780\n He would have been working on that, maybe not.\n\n1:50:09.780 --> 1:50:11.980\n And then he would never have worked on LIGO,\n\n1:50:11.980 --> 1:50:14.020\n and then he wouldn't have won the Nobel Prize, right?\n\n1:50:14.020 --> 1:50:15.500\n So you look at counterfactual history.\n\n1:50:15.500 --> 1:50:17.000\n That's not actually a big stretch, right?\n\n1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:19.140\n If the SSC had still gone on, he would have worked on it,\n\n1:50:19.140 --> 1:50:20.540\n because he was one of the primary leaders\n\n1:50:20.540 --> 1:50:21.900\n of that experiment.\n\n1:50:21.900 --> 1:50:26.300\n Second thing, imagine the following thing had happened.\n\n1:50:26.300 --> 1:50:30.480\n They won the Nobel Prize because in September 2015,\n\n1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:32.360\n they detected unequivocal evidence\n\n1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:35.940\n for the in spiral collision of two massive black holes,\n\n1:50:35.940 --> 1:50:38.220\n each about 30 times the mass of the sun,\n\n1:50:38.220 --> 1:50:42.420\n leaving behind an object that had just less than 60 solar\n\n1:50:42.420 --> 1:50:43.180\n masses behind.\n\n1:50:43.180 --> 1:50:45.780\n So one solar mass worth of matter\n\n1:50:45.780 --> 1:50:49.040\n got massed, got converted to pure gravitational energy.\n\n1:50:49.040 --> 1:50:51.260\n No light was seen by them.\n\n1:50:51.260 --> 1:50:57.060\n This particular date, September 14, 2015,\n\n1:50:57.060 --> 1:50:59.940\n that explosion, because of the miracle of time travel\n\n1:50:59.940 --> 1:51:03.380\n that telescopes afford us, that actually took place\n\n1:51:03.380 --> 1:51:07.260\n 1.2 billion years ago in a galaxy far, far away.\n\n1:51:07.260 --> 1:51:08.900\n They actually don't know which galaxy it took place in.\n\n1:51:08.900 --> 1:51:10.460\n Still, then they never will.\n\n1:51:10.460 --> 1:51:11.740\n OK?\n\n1:51:11.740 --> 1:51:13.780\n If that collision between these two things, which\n\n1:51:13.780 --> 1:51:16.460\n have probably been orbiting each other for maybe a million\n\n1:51:16.460 --> 1:51:20.220\n years or more, if that had occurred 15 days earlier,\n\n1:51:20.220 --> 1:51:22.700\n Barry wouldn't have won the Nobel Prize.\n\n1:51:22.700 --> 1:51:25.740\n Because it's hilarious to think that there's one\n\n1:51:25.740 --> 1:51:29.780\n human that won the Nobel Prize because two giant things\n\n1:51:29.780 --> 1:51:31.300\n collided.\n\n1:51:31.300 --> 1:51:34.300\n A billion, 200 million years ago.\n\n1:51:34.300 --> 1:51:37.340\n And if it had happened 18 days, 20 days, 30 days,\n\n1:51:37.340 --> 1:51:40.100\n because that was the deadline for the Nobel Prize\n\n1:51:40.100 --> 1:51:43.260\n to be announced, they announced the findings in February.\n\n1:51:43.260 --> 1:51:45.340\n But you have to nominate the winners in January.\n\n1:51:45.340 --> 1:51:48.060\n So I could have nominated them up until January 30.\n\n1:51:48.060 --> 1:51:49.860\n But they didn't announce anything,\n\n1:51:49.860 --> 1:51:53.020\n and there were just rumors.\n\n1:51:53.020 --> 1:51:54.620\n But the reason that he wouldn't have won it,\n\n1:51:54.620 --> 1:51:56.700\n because there was another guy who was still alive,\n\n1:51:56.700 --> 1:52:00.100\n considered to be the founder and father of the three fathers,\n\n1:52:00.100 --> 1:52:02.460\n Ray Weiss, who did win it, Kip Thorne, who did win it,\n\n1:52:02.460 --> 1:52:05.180\n and this third gentleman at Caltech named Ron Drever,\n\n1:52:05.180 --> 1:52:07.060\n who passed away again.\n\n1:52:07.060 --> 1:52:08.780\n He was alive in 2016.\n\n1:52:08.780 --> 1:52:10.140\n He died in the middle of 2017.\n\n1:52:10.140 --> 1:52:12.660\n And then he was awarded the Nobel Prize.\n\n1:52:12.660 --> 1:52:16.580\n And here we are, several billion of hairless apes\n\n1:52:16.580 --> 1:52:23.500\n that strangely wear clothing, celebrated three other clothed\n\n1:52:23.500 --> 1:52:30.620\n hairless apes with a medal, with one particular element.\n\n1:52:30.620 --> 1:52:33.980\n And then they made speeches in a particular language\n\n1:52:33.980 --> 1:52:35.180\n that evolved in a...\n\n1:52:35.180 --> 1:52:38.780\n Bend down to get those medals in front of another guy\n\n1:52:38.780 --> 1:52:43.140\n who wears even fancier clothes, who is the king of Sweden.\n\n1:52:43.140 --> 1:52:44.860\n And then they got some free food afterwards.\n\n1:52:44.860 --> 1:52:47.020\n They get some reindeer meat, that's right.\n\n1:52:47.020 --> 1:52:49.860\n Okay, excellent.\n\n1:52:49.860 --> 1:52:53.060\n Since you mentioned Joe Rogan in that little example,\n\n1:52:53.060 --> 1:52:57.180\n what happened to you in terms of BICEP2?\n\n1:52:57.180 --> 1:53:00.940\n I want to kind of speak at a high level\n\n1:53:00.940 --> 1:53:02.500\n about a particular thing I observed.\n\n1:53:02.500 --> 1:53:05.860\n So I was a fan of Joe Rogan since he started the podcast.\n\n1:53:05.860 --> 1:53:07.020\n I just listened to the podcast.\n\n1:53:07.020 --> 1:53:09.540\n I'm a huge fan of podcasts in general.\n\n1:53:09.540 --> 1:53:15.580\n And it also coincided with my entry into grad school\n\n1:53:15.580 --> 1:53:17.580\n and this whole journey of academia.\n\n1:53:17.580 --> 1:53:20.500\n So grad school, getting my PhD, then going to MIT,\n\n1:53:20.500 --> 1:53:23.900\n and then Google, and then just looking at this whole world\n\n1:53:23.900 --> 1:53:26.540\n of research.\n\n1:53:26.540 --> 1:53:33.660\n What I really loved about how Joe Rogan approaches the world\n\n1:53:33.660 --> 1:53:37.340\n is that he celebrates others, like he promotes them.\n\n1:53:37.340 --> 1:53:39.860\n He gets like genuinely, and I now know this\n\n1:53:39.860 --> 1:53:42.740\n from just being a friend privately,\n\n1:53:42.740 --> 1:53:47.740\n he genuinely gets excited by the success of others.\n\n1:53:47.740 --> 1:53:53.140\n And the contrast of that to how folks in academia\n\n1:53:53.140 --> 1:53:56.660\n often behave was always really disappointing to me\n\n1:53:56.660 --> 1:54:00.700\n because the natural, just on a basic human level,\n\n1:54:00.700 --> 1:54:04.940\n there is an excitement, but the nature of that excitement\n\n1:54:04.940 --> 1:54:08.620\n is more like I'm happy for my friend,\n\n1:54:08.620 --> 1:54:11.380\n but I'm really jealous and I want to even outdo them.\n\n1:54:11.380 --> 1:54:13.940\n I want to celebrate them, but I want to do even better.\n\n1:54:13.940 --> 1:54:15.980\n So that's even for friends.\n\n1:54:15.980 --> 1:54:21.140\n So there's not a genuine, pure excitement for others.\n\n1:54:21.140 --> 1:54:24.980\n And then to couple that with just you now\n\n1:54:24.980 --> 1:54:28.220\n as a host of a popular podcast and all this feeling,\n\n1:54:28.220 --> 1:54:31.180\n which is like there's not even a willingness\n\n1:54:31.180 --> 1:54:35.260\n to celebrate publicly the awesomeness of others.\n\n1:54:35.260 --> 1:54:40.900\n People in academia are often best equipped technically\n\n1:54:40.900 --> 1:54:43.340\n in terms of language to celebrate others.\n\n1:54:43.340 --> 1:54:48.060\n They understand the beauty, like the full richness\n\n1:54:48.060 --> 1:54:50.980\n of why the cool idea is as cool as it is.\n\n1:54:50.980 --> 1:54:53.340\n And they're in the best position to celebrate it.\n\n1:54:53.340 --> 1:54:57.020\n And yet there's a feeling that if I celebrate others,\n\n1:54:57.020 --> 1:54:59.900\n they might end up on the cover of Nature or whatever,\n\n1:54:59.900 --> 1:55:01.740\n and not me.\n\n1:55:01.740 --> 1:55:03.860\n They turn it into zero sum game.\n\n1:55:03.860 --> 1:55:08.500\n The reason why I think Rogan has been an inspiration to me\n\n1:55:08.500 --> 1:55:12.060\n and many others is that it doesn't have to be that way.\n\n1:55:12.060 --> 1:55:15.300\n And forget money and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:55:15.300 --> 1:55:20.300\n I think there's a narrative told that academics are this way\n\n1:55:20.300 --> 1:55:23.180\n because there's a limited amount of money.\n\n1:55:23.180 --> 1:55:24.500\n And so they're fighting for this.\n\n1:55:24.500 --> 1:55:28.460\n I don't think that's the reason it's happening this way.\n\n1:55:28.460 --> 1:55:32.860\n I think you can have a limited amount of money.\n\n1:55:32.860 --> 1:55:36.860\n The battle for money happens in the space of proposal.\n\n1:55:36.860 --> 1:55:39.340\n There's networking, there's private stuff.\n\n1:55:39.340 --> 1:55:42.780\n Public celebration of others and just actually\n\n1:55:42.780 --> 1:55:46.140\n just how you feel in the privacy of your own heart\n\n1:55:46.140 --> 1:55:48.500\n is not have to do anything with money.\n\n1:55:48.500 --> 1:55:51.940\n It has to do with you having a big ego\n\n1:55:51.940 --> 1:55:55.020\n and not humbling yourself to the beauty of the journey\n\n1:55:55.020 --> 1:55:56.460\n that we're all on.\n\n1:55:56.460 --> 1:56:00.540\n And there's folks like Joe Rogan who in a comedian circles\n\n1:56:00.540 --> 1:56:03.900\n is also rare, but he inspired all these other comedians\n\n1:56:03.900 --> 1:56:05.540\n to realize, you know what?\n\n1:56:05.540 --> 1:56:07.060\n It's great to celebrate each other.\n\n1:56:07.060 --> 1:56:10.300\n We're promoting each other and therefore the pie grows.\n\n1:56:10.300 --> 1:56:12.860\n Cause everybody else gets excited about this whole thing\n\n1:56:12.860 --> 1:56:14.060\n and the pie grows.\n\n1:56:14.060 --> 1:56:16.420\n Right now the scientists by fighting,\n\n1:56:16.420 --> 1:56:18.620\n like by not celebrating each other,\n\n1:56:18.620 --> 1:56:19.980\n are not growing the pie.\n\n1:56:19.980 --> 1:56:23.180\n And now because of that sort of science becomes\n\n1:56:23.180 --> 1:56:24.020\n less and less popular.\n\n1:56:24.020 --> 1:56:25.620\n It's a flywheel and exactly.\n\n1:56:25.620 --> 1:56:26.700\n No, and I want to point out two things.\n\n1:56:26.700 --> 1:56:29.860\n One is that I remember you went on Joe's show\n\n1:56:29.860 --> 1:56:34.460\n maybe a couple of years ago and then he gave you a watch.\n\n1:56:34.460 --> 1:56:36.220\n He gave you like a Rolex, right?\n\n1:56:36.220 --> 1:56:38.860\n And I tweeted to you and I think it's Omega, sorry.\n\n1:56:38.860 --> 1:56:40.300\n Okay, fine.\n\n1:56:40.300 --> 1:56:42.420\n The watch that went to the moon,\n\n1:56:42.420 --> 1:56:44.620\n which we will get to in a bit.\n\n1:56:44.620 --> 1:56:46.300\n I don't think he could give you what I gave you though,\n\n1:56:46.300 --> 1:56:47.660\n by the way.\n\n1:56:47.660 --> 1:56:50.540\n And we'll get to what that final gift package is for you.\n\n1:56:50.540 --> 1:56:52.300\n And by the way, I also wanted to mention,\n\n1:56:52.300 --> 1:56:55.180\n because when you said Joe Rogan, I would not be upset.\n\n1:56:55.180 --> 1:56:57.060\n And you should definitely go on Joe Rogan.\n\n1:56:57.060 --> 1:56:59.620\n And we had this conversation with him.\n\n1:56:59.620 --> 1:57:04.620\n Cause I was like, when I was moving to Austin\n\n1:57:05.260 --> 1:57:07.300\n and had a conversation like, don't you think it's weird?\n\n1:57:07.300 --> 1:57:09.420\n Like if we have the same guests at the same time\n\n1:57:09.420 --> 1:57:12.580\n or whatever, he's like, fuck that.\n\n1:57:12.580 --> 1:57:14.580\n I want you to be more successful than me.\n\n1:57:14.580 --> 1:57:18.540\n I want, he truly wants everybody like,\n\n1:57:18.540 --> 1:57:21.060\n especially people close to him to be more successful.\n\n1:57:21.060 --> 1:57:23.180\n Like there's not even a thought like.\n\n1:57:23.180 --> 1:57:24.220\n But you know why he does.\n\n1:57:24.220 --> 1:57:25.060\n And this is what I tweeted to you.\n\n1:57:25.060 --> 1:57:27.340\n And one of the few things I think you have retweeted\n\n1:57:27.340 --> 1:57:28.180\n that I sent you.\n\n1:57:28.180 --> 1:57:31.020\n I said, someday you're going to give that to somebody.\n\n1:57:31.020 --> 1:57:32.540\n And today I wanted that to be me.\n\n1:57:32.540 --> 1:57:33.380\n No, no.\n\n1:57:35.580 --> 1:57:36.420\n Joe's Omega.\n\n1:57:36.420 --> 1:57:40.220\n No, but the point is he sees in you that same,\n\n1:57:40.220 --> 1:57:42.980\n grandiosity, that same genuine spirit graciousness.\n\n1:57:42.980 --> 1:57:43.820\n And I think that's true.\n\n1:57:43.820 --> 1:57:45.460\n And you do do something very rare.\n\n1:57:45.460 --> 1:57:47.260\n I don't want to turn this into too much of a love fest,\n\n1:57:47.260 --> 1:57:49.980\n but I do want to say even back to Andrew,\n\n1:57:49.980 --> 1:57:52.780\n who I've almost been hagiographic about,\n\n1:57:52.780 --> 1:57:54.220\n just treating him like a saint.\n\n1:57:54.220 --> 1:57:55.060\n He said to me the same thing.\n\n1:57:55.060 --> 1:57:57.980\n And in a moment of peak said like,\n\n1:57:57.980 --> 1:57:58.820\n God damn it.\n\n1:57:58.820 --> 1:58:02.460\n Like I have to train these guys and women that work for me\n\n1:58:02.460 --> 1:58:04.220\n so that they can be better than me,\n\n1:58:04.220 --> 1:58:06.320\n so that they can go out and compete with me\n\n1:58:06.320 --> 1:58:09.860\n for the same limited amount of funding from the Fing NSL.\n\n1:58:09.860 --> 1:58:12.060\n That wasn't his, that wasn't who he was.\n\n1:58:12.060 --> 1:58:14.060\n That was just an expression,\n\n1:58:14.060 --> 1:58:16.460\n like I'm doing something which is fundamentally,\n\n1:58:16.460 --> 1:58:18.960\n but you know what, when you have kids,\n\n1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:20.900\n hopefully, you know, please God, you will someday.\n\n1:58:20.900 --> 1:58:22.660\n Cause I think, and I hope we can get to talk\n\n1:58:22.660 --> 1:58:26.060\n about that later, but part of investment\n\n1:58:26.060 --> 1:58:28.580\n and part of doing something when you have a kid,\n\n1:58:28.580 --> 1:58:30.420\n like you can get married.\n\n1:58:30.420 --> 1:58:33.020\n You can marry someone cause she's rich or he's rich,\n\n1:58:33.020 --> 1:58:35.100\n or you can marry someone cause they're good looking\n\n1:58:35.100 --> 1:58:36.300\n or he's good looking.\n\n1:58:36.300 --> 1:58:37.940\n You can marry for all these different reasons\n\n1:58:37.940 --> 1:58:39.980\n that are ultimately selfish.\n\n1:58:39.980 --> 1:58:41.860\n There's no way you can have a kid and be selfish.\n\n1:58:41.860 --> 1:58:43.140\n Nobody says like, oh, you know what?\n\n1:58:43.140 --> 1:58:44.960\n I really want this thing that's three feet tall,\n\n1:58:44.960 --> 1:58:47.060\n that doesn't speak English, that craps on my floor,\n\n1:58:47.060 --> 1:58:48.500\n that wakes me up all hours of the night,\n\n1:58:48.500 --> 1:58:50.040\n that interferes with my love life.\n\n1:58:50.040 --> 1:58:52.120\n Nobody says that cause it doesn't benefit you\n\n1:58:52.120 --> 1:58:53.060\n for months and months.\n\n1:58:53.060 --> 1:58:55.100\n A friend of mine who actually does the videos for me\n\n1:58:55.100 --> 1:58:57.180\n and does a lot of my solo videos,\n\n1:58:57.180 --> 1:58:59.300\n he's having his first kid, he's like, what do I do?\n\n1:58:59.300 --> 1:59:01.660\n Cause it always gets stupid, I'll catch up on sleep now.\n\n1:59:01.660 --> 1:59:04.340\n Like, yeah, I'm gonna store sleep in my sleep bank.\n\n1:59:04.340 --> 1:59:06.700\n Like I don't think Huberman and you talked about that, right?\n\n1:59:06.700 --> 1:59:08.080\n You can't do that, that's stupid.\n\n1:59:08.080 --> 1:59:10.840\n What you can do, give the kid a bath, feed the baby,\n\n1:59:10.840 --> 1:59:11.820\n let the mother relax.\n\n1:59:11.820 --> 1:59:14.060\n Like, in other words, do the things,\n\n1:59:14.060 --> 1:59:16.380\n and this really relates back to what Aristotle once said.\n\n1:59:16.380 --> 1:59:18.980\n Aristotle once said, why do parents love kids\n\n1:59:18.980 --> 1:59:20.780\n more than kids love parents?\n\n1:59:20.780 --> 1:59:22.760\n As much as you love your dad and your mom,\n\n1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:24.580\n they still love you more.\n\n1:59:24.580 --> 1:59:27.140\n And because you love that what you sacrifice for.\n\n1:59:27.140 --> 1:59:28.780\n Here's a proof.\n\n1:59:28.780 --> 1:59:31.020\n I know a lot of families that have kids with special needs.\n\n1:59:31.020 --> 1:59:35.020\n Some with severe, one of my uncles on the Keating side\n\n1:59:35.020 --> 1:59:37.280\n had a severe, what they called mental retardation,\n\n1:59:37.280 --> 1:59:39.220\n now it's probably has a different name.\n\n1:59:39.220 --> 1:59:41.980\n That, out of the nine other brothers and sisters,\n\n1:59:41.980 --> 1:59:43.580\n he was their favorite.\n\n1:59:43.580 --> 1:59:46.100\n Because they had to sacrifice so much for him.\n\n1:59:46.100 --> 1:59:48.340\n And I think of that, you know, in the small case,\n\n1:59:48.340 --> 1:59:50.340\n like Joe is kind of mentoring you or whatever,\n\n1:59:50.340 --> 1:59:51.260\n you're gonna mentor someone else.\n\n1:59:51.260 --> 1:59:53.620\n You love that what you sacrifice for.\n\n1:59:53.620 --> 1:59:55.700\n Sacrifice is reduction of entropy,\n\n1:59:55.700 --> 1:59:58.740\n it's storing and investing, and you wanna protect that.\n\n1:59:58.740 --> 2:00:01.460\n And you know, that to me really speaks to this.\n\n2:00:01.460 --> 2:00:02.900\n So yeah, I don't hold it against.\n\n2:00:02.900 --> 2:00:05.540\n But it is true, like scientists are, you know,\n\n2:00:05.540 --> 2:00:07.580\n when they're described again, they're often said\n\n2:00:07.580 --> 2:00:08.420\n to be like children, right?\n\n2:00:08.420 --> 2:00:09.380\n You've heard this description.\n\n2:00:09.380 --> 2:00:11.580\n They're inquisitive, they're curious, they're passionate.\n\n2:00:11.580 --> 2:00:12.420\n They love that.\n\n2:00:12.420 --> 2:00:13.540\n And I'm like, yeah, and they don't play well with others.\n\n2:00:13.540 --> 2:00:14.860\n They're jealous, they're petty, they're selfish,\n\n2:00:14.860 --> 2:00:17.420\n they won't share their ball and they'll go home.\n\n2:00:17.420 --> 2:00:19.060\n There's no such thing as a single edge sword.\n\n2:00:19.060 --> 2:00:20.780\n I wish there were, you know,\n\n2:00:20.780 --> 2:00:22.340\n because we need some more of that\n\n2:00:22.340 --> 2:00:23.860\n because you gotta dull it up.\n\n2:00:23.860 --> 2:00:26.500\n But in this case, he, you know,\n\n2:00:26.500 --> 2:00:31.500\n I think when you have this kind of investment in science,\n\n2:00:31.500 --> 2:00:32.900\n it's gonna be natural.\n\n2:00:32.900 --> 2:00:34.580\n But that doesn't mean we have to like, you know,\n\n2:00:34.580 --> 2:00:36.980\n feed the flames of competition.\n\n2:00:36.980 --> 2:00:38.460\n You know, I'm like really venerate.\n\n2:00:38.460 --> 2:00:40.340\n If you go to the homepage of the NSF\n\n2:00:40.340 --> 2:00:41.740\n or the Department of Energy\n\n2:00:41.740 --> 2:00:44.620\n or the recently released National Academy of Sciences\n\n2:00:44.620 --> 2:00:47.980\n future of science for the astronomical sciences\n\n2:00:47.980 --> 2:00:50.380\n for the next 25 years or more,\n\n2:00:50.380 --> 2:00:51.860\n they talk about how many Nobel prizes\n\n2:00:51.860 --> 2:00:53.580\n these different science things could win.\n\n2:00:53.580 --> 2:00:56.500\n Exoplanets, life, the discovery of the CMB,\n\n2:00:56.500 --> 2:00:58.980\n B mode polarization, the nice, you know,\n\n2:00:58.980 --> 2:01:01.300\n that's figure two in this thing.\n\n2:01:01.300 --> 2:01:03.140\n And I'm like, what message is that sent to kids,\n\n2:01:03.140 --> 2:01:04.820\n like to young people?\n\n2:01:04.820 --> 2:01:06.100\n Like that's what you should be doing\n\n2:01:06.100 --> 2:01:07.380\n so that you win this small, as you said,\n\n2:01:07.380 --> 2:01:09.140\n this prize given out by one hairless ape\n\n2:01:09.140 --> 2:01:11.340\n to another wearing a fancier costume using reindeer.\n\n2:01:11.340 --> 2:01:12.460\n Especially in the case of Nobel prize,\n\n2:01:12.460 --> 2:01:14.780\n it's only currently given to three people.\n\n2:01:14.780 --> 2:01:16.940\n At most, which was never one of his stipulate.\n\n2:01:16.940 --> 2:01:19.300\n He actually said one, he could only give it to one person.\n\n2:01:19.300 --> 2:01:20.140\n So they change it.\n\n2:01:20.140 --> 2:01:20.980\n Why did they change it?\n\n2:01:20.980 --> 2:01:22.180\n I talk about, I speculate.\n\n2:01:22.180 --> 2:01:24.180\n By the way, the book's only three chapters out of 11\n\n2:01:24.180 --> 2:01:26.900\n about the Nobel prize and it's a fact.\n\n2:01:26.900 --> 2:01:28.940\n But you know, one of the things that's been so interesting,\n\n2:01:28.940 --> 2:01:32.420\n like I'm speaking, actually this coming up in December\n\n2:01:32.420 --> 2:01:34.500\n is that the Nobel prize is given out\n\n2:01:34.500 --> 2:01:37.100\n on the day of Alfred Nobel's death.\n\n2:01:37.100 --> 2:01:39.500\n There's a lot of, and they bring in flowers,\n\n2:01:39.500 --> 2:01:42.060\n not from his birthplace, but from his mausoleum,\n\n2:01:42.060 --> 2:01:46.780\n which is in San Romino in Italy.\n\n2:01:46.780 --> 2:01:48.700\n It's a lot of like death fascination.\n\n2:01:48.700 --> 2:01:51.300\n Denial of death features heavily in the Nobel prize\n\n2:01:51.300 --> 2:01:53.660\n because it's like, what outlives a person?\n\n2:01:53.660 --> 2:01:55.220\n Well, science can outlive a person.\n\n2:01:55.220 --> 2:01:56.900\n My father has a theorem named after him.\n\n2:01:56.900 --> 2:02:00.700\n It's still engraved in many places around the world.\n\n2:02:00.700 --> 2:02:02.620\n You or I, we can go to different places around the world.\n\n2:02:02.620 --> 2:02:05.060\n People know who we are based on our publications.\n\n2:02:05.060 --> 2:02:06.660\n We engrave things, we want to store things,\n\n2:02:06.660 --> 2:02:08.220\n we want to compress things.\n\n2:02:08.220 --> 2:02:10.380\n And I think there's something beautiful about that,\n\n2:02:10.380 --> 2:02:12.140\n but there is a notion of denial of death.\n\n2:02:12.140 --> 2:02:14.780\n Like there is a notion of what will outlast me,\n\n2:02:14.780 --> 2:02:17.860\n especially if you're among the many 90 something percent\n\n2:02:17.860 --> 2:02:19.140\n of members of the National Academy\n\n2:02:19.140 --> 2:02:24.140\n don't believe in an active faith and a creator and a God.\n\n2:02:24.540 --> 2:02:27.620\n And science can substitute for that,\n\n2:02:27.620 --> 2:02:30.700\n but it's not ultimately as fulfilling.\n\n2:02:30.700 --> 2:02:34.340\n I just, I don't believe it can fulfill a person the way\n\n2:02:34.340 --> 2:02:37.420\n even practicing, but not believing in a religion\n\n2:02:37.420 --> 2:02:39.260\n can fulfill a person.\n\n2:02:39.260 --> 2:02:40.860\n So, which is interesting\n\n2:02:40.860 --> 2:02:42.500\n because you do bring up Ernest Becker\n\n2:02:42.500 --> 2:02:46.660\n and the denial of death in losing the Nobel prize book.\n\n2:02:46.660 --> 2:02:50.780\n And there is a sense in which that's probably in part\n\n2:02:50.780 --> 2:02:54.300\n at the core of this, especially later dream\n\n2:02:54.300 --> 2:02:57.100\n of the Nobel prize or a prize of recognition.\n\n2:02:57.100 --> 2:03:02.100\n I've interacted with a few or a large number of scientists\n\n2:03:02.140 --> 2:03:04.500\n that are getting up in age.\n\n2:03:04.500 --> 2:03:09.500\n And there is the feeling of real pride of happiness in them\n\n2:03:10.180 --> 2:03:15.180\n from winning awards and getting certain recognitions.\n\n2:03:15.180 --> 2:03:18.500\n And I probably at the core of that is a kind of a mortality\n\n2:03:18.500 --> 2:03:23.500\n or a kind of desire for mortality.\n\n2:03:23.500 --> 2:03:28.500\n And that was always off putting to me as opposed to,\n\n2:03:28.740 --> 2:03:32.340\n I mean, I know it sounds weird to say it's off putting,\n\n2:03:32.340 --> 2:03:37.340\n but it just, rather than celebrating the pure joy\n\n2:03:38.460 --> 2:03:43.460\n of solving the puzzles of the mysteries all around us,\n\n2:03:43.460 --> 2:03:52.460\n just the actual exploration of the mysterious for its own sake.\n\n2:03:52.460 --> 2:03:55.940\n Well, that's what I said, it's like a scientist should,\n\n2:03:55.940 --> 2:03:58.860\n okay, you have to be careful and not have any physical,\n\n2:03:58.860 --> 2:03:59.700\n it has to be platonic,\n\n2:03:59.700 --> 2:04:03.180\n but you can think of scientists and mentor.\n\n2:04:03.180 --> 2:04:05.300\n I have a chart in the book and in my plaque\n\n2:04:05.300 --> 2:04:07.500\n made by one of my graduate students, former graduate students.\n\n2:04:07.500 --> 2:04:10.620\n She's now a professor in New Mexico, Darcy Barron.\n\n2:04:10.620 --> 2:04:13.980\n And she made this plaque and it has 17 generations.\n\n2:04:13.980 --> 2:04:17.340\n So here I am, 17 levels down, there's a guy,\n\n2:04:17.340 --> 2:04:19.620\n Leibniz, not the famous Leibniz, different Leibniz,\n\n2:04:19.620 --> 2:04:23.100\n 1596 he was born and I'm in this chain.\n\n2:04:23.100 --> 2:04:24.660\n And I don't know if you know this,\n\n2:04:24.660 --> 2:04:26.020\n but in the Russian language,\n\n2:04:26.020 --> 2:04:28.980\n the word scientist means someone who was taught.\n\n2:04:28.980 --> 2:04:31.300\n I'll say it very simply, one who was taught, right?\n\n2:04:31.300 --> 2:04:32.140\n Uchony.\n\n2:04:32.140 --> 2:04:32.980\n Uchony.\n\n2:04:32.980 --> 2:04:35.180\n So it probably means a guy was taught, right?\n\n2:04:35.180 --> 2:04:39.180\n No, uchony, no, no, no, it's a person.\n\n2:04:39.180 --> 2:04:42.500\n Uchony, no, no, no, it's literally someone who was taught.\n\n2:04:42.500 --> 2:04:43.900\n Someone who was taught, right.\n\n2:04:43.900 --> 2:04:44.740\n So what does that mean?\n\n2:04:44.740 --> 2:04:47.540\n To me, it has a dual kind of meaning, at least dual meaning.\n\n2:04:47.540 --> 2:04:50.780\n One is that you have to be a good student to be a scientist\n\n2:04:50.780 --> 2:04:52.620\n because you have to learn from somebody else.\n\n2:04:52.620 --> 2:04:55.180\n Two, you have to be a teacher, you have to pay it forward.\n\n2:04:55.180 --> 2:04:58.580\n If you don't, I claim you're really not a scientist\n\n2:04:58.580 --> 2:05:00.180\n in the truest sense.\n\n2:05:00.180 --> 2:05:02.220\n And I feel like with the work that I do in outreach\n\n2:05:02.220 --> 2:05:04.300\n and stuff like that, I'm doing it at scale.\n\n2:05:04.300 --> 2:05:07.140\n I'm influencing more than 24 kids I might have\n\n2:05:07.140 --> 2:05:09.380\n in my graduate class or undergraduate class,\n\n2:05:09.380 --> 2:05:11.660\n and potentially could reach thousands of people\n\n2:05:11.660 --> 2:05:15.980\n around the world and make them into scientists themselves.\n\n2:05:15.980 --> 2:05:19.060\n Because that's the flywheel that is only beneficial.\n\n2:05:19.060 --> 2:05:20.420\n There is no competition.\n\n2:05:20.420 --> 2:05:24.940\n There is no zero sum fixed mindset versus growth mindset\n\n2:05:24.940 --> 2:05:26.460\n because it is an infinite game.\n\n2:05:26.460 --> 2:05:29.260\n Imagine a culture that had none of the trappings\n\n2:05:29.260 --> 2:05:30.980\n of the negativity of the Soviet Union\n\n2:05:30.980 --> 2:05:35.620\n or pre World War I Germany or Imperial Japan.\n\n2:05:35.620 --> 2:05:37.380\n Science celebrated.\n\n2:05:37.380 --> 2:05:40.380\n And we're just making a nation of scientists.\n\n2:05:40.380 --> 2:05:42.900\n And we're not doing it to become multi billionaires\n\n2:05:42.900 --> 2:05:47.100\n or necessarily for any military purpose whatsoever.\n\n2:05:47.100 --> 2:05:50.460\n But if we have that, sometimes I'm flying home at night.\n\n2:05:50.460 --> 2:05:53.100\n When you fly into LA, you literally, it's very rare,\n\n2:05:53.100 --> 2:05:55.100\n you can see the number 10 million.\n\n2:05:55.100 --> 2:05:56.780\n It's very hard to visualize things.\n\n2:05:56.780 --> 2:05:58.980\n You see a brick wall, you ask how many bricks are there?\n\n2:05:58.980 --> 2:06:00.540\n It might be 1,000, 2,000.\n\n2:06:00.540 --> 2:06:01.740\n 10 million lights.\n\n2:06:01.740 --> 2:06:03.380\n There's 10 million souls.\n\n2:06:03.380 --> 2:06:04.940\n And you can see they're discrete.\n\n2:06:04.940 --> 2:06:07.020\n They're not like the Milky Way all blending together.\n\n2:06:07.020 --> 2:06:11.900\n Each lost in their own busy lives, excited, fall in love,\n\n2:06:11.900 --> 2:06:13.900\n afraid of losing their job, all that.\n\n2:06:13.900 --> 2:06:16.020\n By the way, people should know that you're a pilot.\n\n2:06:16.020 --> 2:06:17.700\n So you literally mean fly.\n\n2:06:17.700 --> 2:06:19.180\n Yeah, sometimes I get to do it.\n\n2:06:19.180 --> 2:06:22.940\n You get to look at the eye of God perspective\n\n2:06:22.940 --> 2:06:26.300\n on these 10 million, on these millions of helpless apes.\n\n2:06:26.300 --> 2:06:28.220\n And I don't think they're like constellations,\n\n2:06:28.220 --> 2:06:29.860\n but upside down, like the city.\n\n2:06:29.860 --> 2:06:30.860\n This is like a constellation.\n\n2:06:30.860 --> 2:06:32.580\n Hopefully I'll stay and keep the plane the right way up.\n\n2:06:32.580 --> 2:06:34.060\n But when you think about that,\n\n2:06:34.060 --> 2:06:36.260\n imagine they're all working together.\n\n2:06:36.260 --> 2:06:38.340\n And imagine you always talk about love.\n\n2:06:38.340 --> 2:06:42.260\n But you don't know that they're not worthy of love.\n\n2:06:42.260 --> 2:06:43.500\n So you're looking down on them.\n\n2:06:43.500 --> 2:06:44.380\n And it's just amazing.\n\n2:06:44.380 --> 2:06:48.420\n Because you think, what amazing creation has man and humans?\n\n2:06:48.420 --> 2:06:49.580\n And what can we do?\n\n2:06:49.580 --> 2:06:50.620\n It's phenomenal.\n\n2:06:50.620 --> 2:06:52.140\n It's so exciting.\n\n2:06:52.140 --> 2:06:53.420\n And then I get to do it.\n\n2:06:53.420 --> 2:06:55.260\n It's a job I say, don't tell Gavin Newsom,\n\n2:06:55.260 --> 2:06:56.820\n but I do it for free.\n\n2:06:56.820 --> 2:06:58.740\n I love what I do.\n\n2:06:58.740 --> 2:07:01.620\n But to think about, oh, if my student succeeds, then I'm not.\n\n2:07:01.620 --> 2:07:05.540\n No, it is unfortunate that you have experience.\n\n2:07:05.540 --> 2:07:06.820\n I've certainly experienced it.\n\n2:07:06.820 --> 2:07:08.980\n And I think there are ways around it.\n\n2:07:08.980 --> 2:07:11.180\n I think it is a vexing problem.\n\n2:07:11.180 --> 2:07:14.380\n Because people want to, it's very tempting\n\n2:07:14.380 --> 2:07:18.180\n to keep your own garden fertilized.\n\n2:07:18.180 --> 2:07:20.340\n One thing that's interesting is people are like,\n\n2:07:20.340 --> 2:07:21.500\n why are you doing this thing?\n\n2:07:21.500 --> 2:07:22.900\n And podcasts, and you're supposed\n\n2:07:22.900 --> 2:07:25.380\n to be a serious scientist leading this huge project,\n\n2:07:25.380 --> 2:07:27.780\n and collaborators.\n\n2:07:27.780 --> 2:07:30.860\n And I'm like, well, most of what I do, as I said before,\n\n2:07:30.860 --> 2:07:31.660\n for you it's Velcro.\n\n2:07:31.660 --> 2:07:36.220\n For me it's like, what is the deal with the safety standards\n\n2:07:36.220 --> 2:07:38.660\n on the truck that we're driving up to deliver the diesel fuel\n\n2:07:38.660 --> 2:07:39.780\n that will power the generator that\n\n2:07:39.780 --> 2:07:40.980\n will allow the concrete truck to move?\n\n2:07:40.980 --> 2:07:42.820\n It has nothing to do with the Big Bang\n\n2:07:42.820 --> 2:07:45.140\n inflation, the multiverse, God's existence.\n\n2:07:45.140 --> 2:07:45.900\n It has nothing to do with that.\n\n2:07:45.900 --> 2:07:48.340\n So those are people I say I have to talk to.\n\n2:07:48.340 --> 2:07:49.980\n The people that come on the show, those\n\n2:07:49.980 --> 2:07:51.500\n are people I want to talk to.\n\n2:07:51.500 --> 2:07:52.420\n And that's super fun.\n\n2:07:52.420 --> 2:07:55.900\n I mean, it's a real honor that I get to do it.\n\n2:07:55.900 --> 2:07:57.580\n I have some unfair advantages.\n\n2:07:57.580 --> 2:07:58.660\n I'm at a top university.\n\n2:07:58.660 --> 2:08:01.060\n We have people that's affiliated with the Arthur C. Clark\n\n2:08:01.060 --> 2:08:04.500\n Foundation, brilliant scientists coming through.\n\n2:08:04.500 --> 2:08:06.900\n But I felt like it would be kind of a shame\n\n2:08:06.900 --> 2:08:09.820\n if I didn't allow them to teach at scale,\n\n2:08:09.820 --> 2:08:11.900\n because they're better teachers than I am.\n\n2:08:11.900 --> 2:08:16.620\n Let me ask you an interesting, maybe difficult question.\n\n2:08:16.620 --> 2:08:21.340\n Have you ever considered talking on your podcast\n\n2:08:21.340 --> 2:08:24.500\n with the people who would get the Nobel Prize for BICEP2\n\n2:08:24.500 --> 2:08:28.220\n if it turned out to be detecting what it is?\n\n2:08:28.220 --> 2:08:30.300\n Yeah, I mean, I'm still friends with them.\n\n2:08:30.300 --> 2:08:32.060\n And they have still gone on to.\n\n2:08:32.060 --> 2:08:34.580\n So we should say why we didn't win the Nobel Prize,\n\n2:08:34.580 --> 2:08:37.940\n and then what happened with the group that\n\n2:08:37.940 --> 2:08:41.060\n is now leading it that I'm completely divorced\n\n2:08:41.060 --> 2:08:43.580\n from in a secular sense.\n\n2:08:43.580 --> 2:08:44.580\n We're friends.\n\n2:08:44.580 --> 2:08:45.940\n We see each other.\n\n2:08:45.940 --> 2:08:48.220\n We send each other emails and stuff like that.\n\n2:08:48.220 --> 2:08:50.340\n I would love to get their sense of what\n\n2:08:50.340 --> 2:08:54.300\n the natural heartbreak built into the whole process\n\n2:08:54.300 --> 2:08:56.140\n of the Nobel Prize, what their sense is.\n\n2:08:56.140 --> 2:08:58.860\n I would love to hear an honest, real conversation.\n\n2:08:58.860 --> 2:09:01.780\n I understand you're friends, but there's some hard truth\n\n2:09:01.780 --> 2:09:03.340\n that even friends don't talk about until you put a mic.\n\n2:09:03.340 --> 2:09:04.180\n They weren't happy I wrote the book.\n\n2:09:04.180 --> 2:09:06.580\n I mean, I remember one of them was like, well,\n\n2:09:06.580 --> 2:09:07.860\n what's this I hear about a book?\n\n2:09:07.860 --> 2:09:10.180\n And I mean, a lot of people told me not to write the book.\n\n2:09:10.180 --> 2:09:12.620\n They said it's going to give too much attention\n\n2:09:12.620 --> 2:09:13.460\n to the Nobel Prize.\n\n2:09:13.460 --> 2:09:15.180\n It's going to look like sour grapes.\n\n2:09:15.180 --> 2:09:17.740\n Again, I say you can prove I have sour grapes or not.\n\n2:09:17.740 --> 2:09:19.740\n Just give me the next prize.\n\n2:09:19.740 --> 2:09:21.860\n So if you get a Nobel Prize for literature,\n\n2:09:21.860 --> 2:09:23.060\n you would turn it down?\n\n2:09:23.060 --> 2:09:24.180\n I don't know.\n\n2:09:24.180 --> 2:09:26.340\n It's funny, because Sabina Hassenfelder,\n\n2:09:26.340 --> 2:09:30.020\n who is a fellow YouTube sensation,\n\n2:09:30.020 --> 2:09:35.300\n and she's so gracious and so good.\n\n2:09:35.300 --> 2:09:40.300\n She has that German, just gentle and genteelness.\n\n2:09:40.300 --> 2:09:43.180\n She's a little too nice for my taste, I would say.\n\n2:09:43.180 --> 2:09:45.220\n I wish she could really say what she thinks and be\n\n2:09:45.220 --> 2:09:46.420\n snarky on occasion.\n\n2:09:46.420 --> 2:09:48.660\n So she wrote a review of my book when it came out\n\n2:09:48.660 --> 2:09:49.900\n three or four years ago.\n\n2:09:49.900 --> 2:09:53.220\n And she said, well, you know, Brian Keating,\n\n2:09:53.220 --> 2:09:55.620\n she said, well, it's interesting.\n\n2:09:55.620 --> 2:09:57.020\n He talks a lot about cosmology.\n\n2:09:57.020 --> 2:10:00.060\n But they can do whatever the hell they want.\n\n2:10:00.060 --> 2:10:02.740\n And he presumably has these problems with it,\n\n2:10:02.740 --> 2:10:05.820\n but it's none of his business, basically.\n\n2:10:05.820 --> 2:10:08.500\n And at the end, she said, but if you want one good thing,\n\n2:10:08.500 --> 2:10:09.500\n he's a really good writer.\n\n2:10:09.500 --> 2:10:10.500\n And who knows?\n\n2:10:10.500 --> 2:10:12.980\n He could win the Nobel Prize in literature someday.\n\n2:10:12.980 --> 2:10:14.580\n And then she allowed me to publish a rebuttal\n\n2:10:14.580 --> 2:10:16.080\n on her blog, which was kind of funny.\n\n2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:17.380\n But anyway, no.\n\n2:10:17.380 --> 2:10:21.300\n So getting back to the guys that we were kind of collaboratimies\n\n2:10:21.300 --> 2:10:24.620\n or frenemies, we're still, look, we\n\n2:10:24.620 --> 2:10:26.380\n don't wish each other active ill.\n\n2:10:26.380 --> 2:10:27.340\n I've visited them.\n\n2:10:27.340 --> 2:10:28.540\n They're welcome to visit me.\n\n2:10:28.540 --> 2:10:29.940\n They have visited me.\n\n2:10:29.940 --> 2:10:31.620\n The thing I have to say is that I just\n\n2:10:31.620 --> 2:10:33.820\n wonder about introspection.\n\n2:10:33.820 --> 2:10:38.500\n For me, literally, I don't care about the Nobel Prize\n\n2:10:38.500 --> 2:10:42.000\n other than what it can do to benefit science.\n\n2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:43.740\n But I no longer, I did, but by the way,\n\n2:10:43.740 --> 2:10:46.460\n I did seriously care about how it would benefit Brian Keating\n\n2:10:46.460 --> 2:10:47.460\n early on in my career.\n\n2:10:47.460 --> 2:10:48.580\n I'm just totally honest.\n\n2:10:48.580 --> 2:10:50.060\n I'm not proud of it.\n\n2:10:50.060 --> 2:10:51.420\n It's kind of embarrassing.\n\n2:10:51.420 --> 2:10:53.940\n But now I would hope that people would say, like, OK,\n\n2:10:53.940 --> 2:10:56.860\n the guy is like, you know, he's obsessed with it.\n\n2:10:56.860 --> 2:10:58.580\n My next book is not about this.\n\n2:10:58.580 --> 2:11:00.300\n It's about something completely different.\n\n2:11:00.300 --> 2:11:05.860\n And I do feel like people lack introspection a lot of times\n\n2:11:05.860 --> 2:11:06.460\n in science.\n\n2:11:06.460 --> 2:11:08.820\n We don't think about why we're doing what we're doing.\n\n2:11:08.820 --> 2:11:11.740\n And I think it comes down to curiosity.\n\n2:11:11.740 --> 2:11:14.860\n One thing about Joe, and again, I've only listened to,\n\n2:11:14.860 --> 2:11:16.300\n like, I have to confess.\n\n2:11:16.300 --> 2:11:17.460\n You know, you're like, my father.\n\n2:11:17.460 --> 2:11:19.420\n Now I'm confessing my sins to you, Father Lex.\n\n2:11:19.420 --> 2:11:21.620\n Father Friedman.\n\n2:11:21.620 --> 2:11:24.380\n I haven't listened to, like, that many of your episodes\n\n2:11:24.380 --> 2:11:25.380\n start to finish, OK?\n\n2:11:25.380 --> 2:11:27.060\n I'm with our friend, mutual friend, Eric.\n\n2:11:27.060 --> 2:11:30.420\n I've listened to a bunch of recent ones.\n\n2:11:30.420 --> 2:11:35.420\n Einstein, Weinstein, Weinstein, Weinstein, that's what it is.\n\n2:11:35.420 --> 2:11:38.140\n I get them confused with the brother.\n\n2:11:38.140 --> 2:11:40.180\n The brothers care about stuff, the brother's wives.\n\n2:11:40.180 --> 2:11:40.900\n And a few others.\n\n2:11:40.900 --> 2:11:43.900\n I haven't ever listened to a full Joe Rogan episode.\n\n2:11:43.900 --> 2:11:45.860\n But from what I've seen with him,\n\n2:11:45.860 --> 2:11:48.380\n he has a preternatural curiosity.\n\n2:11:48.380 --> 2:11:49.380\n He doesn't have passion.\n\n2:11:49.380 --> 2:11:50.780\n There are a lot of podcasts that have passion.\n\n2:11:50.780 --> 2:11:52.220\n Like, I've been on their show.\n\n2:11:52.220 --> 2:11:53.020\n He has curiosity.\n\n2:11:53.020 --> 2:11:55.300\n Like, he's not going to stop talking about something\n\n2:11:55.300 --> 2:11:57.300\n until he hops it, until he understands it,\n\n2:11:57.300 --> 2:11:59.340\n until he gets it viscerally.\n\n2:11:59.340 --> 2:12:00.340\n And I respect that.\n\n2:12:00.340 --> 2:12:02.940\n Because as I say in this more recent book,\n\n2:12:02.940 --> 2:12:05.420\n passion's kind of like the dopamine hit\n\n2:12:05.420 --> 2:12:07.700\n that gets you started, like, oh, I'm going to be great.\n\n2:12:07.700 --> 2:12:08.820\n Maybe I can win a Nobel Prize.\n\n2:12:08.820 --> 2:12:10.780\n Like, that's not going to sustain you.\n\n2:12:10.780 --> 2:12:13.300\n The sustenance comes from the passion\n\n2:12:13.300 --> 2:12:15.300\n converting to curiosity.\n\n2:12:15.300 --> 2:12:18.300\n And what I want to do is convert as many things as possible\n\n2:12:18.300 --> 2:12:20.180\n to things that I can then.\n\n2:12:20.180 --> 2:12:24.060\n Because actually, I've had people that discuss addiction.\n\n2:12:24.060 --> 2:12:27.740\n And there is an addictive quality to doing podcasts\n\n2:12:27.740 --> 2:12:28.220\n or whatever.\n\n2:12:28.220 --> 2:12:30.420\n But there's an addictive quality being a scientist.\n\n2:12:30.420 --> 2:12:33.380\n And you get to do things that are very specialized\n\n2:12:33.380 --> 2:12:36.180\n in specialized locations with special people,\n\n2:12:36.180 --> 2:12:38.820\n paid for by other people who have no freaking idea what\n\n2:12:38.820 --> 2:12:39.340\n you do.\n\n2:12:39.340 --> 2:12:41.820\n I mean, imagine you worked in some job.\n\n2:12:41.820 --> 2:12:44.780\n And Feynman said all these contradictory things.\n\n2:12:44.780 --> 2:12:49.460\n Like, he said, if you can't explain it to your grandmother,\n\n2:12:49.460 --> 2:12:50.980\n you don't understand it yourself.\n\n2:12:50.980 --> 2:12:52.220\n Then the day you won the Nobel Prize,\n\n2:12:52.220 --> 2:12:53.500\n a reporter asked him, what did you win it for?\n\n2:12:53.500 --> 2:12:55.340\n He said, if I could explain it to you, bud,\n\n2:12:55.340 --> 2:12:56.500\n it wouldn't be worth a Nobel Prize.\n\n2:12:56.500 --> 2:12:58.940\n So let's leave aside his inherent contradictions.\n\n2:12:58.940 --> 2:13:02.660\n But in reality, there is a kind of like dopamine rush\n\n2:13:02.660 --> 2:13:03.540\n that you get from it.\n\n2:13:03.540 --> 2:13:07.640\n But what is ultimately going to be the sustenance of it?\n\n2:13:07.640 --> 2:13:12.500\n So yeah, I do feel like we have to find a way to nucleate that.\n\n2:13:12.500 --> 2:13:14.860\n I don't know, actually, I don't know if it's like,\n\n2:13:14.860 --> 2:13:16.820\n can you turn someone into a scientist?\n\n2:13:16.820 --> 2:13:18.780\n I used to ask this question all the time.\n\n2:13:18.780 --> 2:13:21.540\n Can you make someone creative?\n\n2:13:21.540 --> 2:13:23.020\n Can you teach someone to be creative?\n\n2:13:23.020 --> 2:13:23.900\n I don't know.\n\n2:13:23.900 --> 2:13:26.420\n Can you teach someone to be curious?\n\n2:13:26.420 --> 2:13:26.940\n I don't know.\n\n2:13:26.940 --> 2:13:29.400\n I do know that kids are naturally curious.\n\n2:13:29.400 --> 2:13:31.460\n As they get older, they get less curious.\n\n2:13:31.460 --> 2:13:34.620\n Just like I heard from the other forward author, James\n\n2:13:34.620 --> 2:13:37.980\n Altucher, he said, once they did a study,\n\n2:13:37.980 --> 2:13:40.540\n kids smile 300 times a day, or smile or laugh.\n\n2:13:40.540 --> 2:13:42.620\n Adults, five or six.\n\n2:13:42.620 --> 2:13:43.380\n Five or six.\n\n2:13:43.380 --> 2:13:45.620\n No, I'm trying to get you to laugh, but you're not going to laugh.\n\n2:13:45.620 --> 2:13:46.660\n But anyway, no, it's true.\n\n2:13:46.660 --> 2:13:49.020\n Somewhere you lose 30% to 50%.\n\n2:13:49.020 --> 2:13:50.820\n I'm not entertained.\n\n2:13:50.820 --> 2:13:52.460\n But that's because I'm an adult.\n\n2:13:52.460 --> 2:13:54.980\n And then I do remember there's some distribution\n\n2:13:54.980 --> 2:13:57.740\n in those studies with happier adults smile a little more,\n\n2:13:57.740 --> 2:13:59.820\n but still the kids blow them out of the water.\n\n2:13:59.820 --> 2:14:02.140\n Just crush it.\n\n2:14:02.140 --> 2:14:04.180\n In other words, should we invest our energy\n\n2:14:04.180 --> 2:14:07.300\n in getting the half life decay constant,\n\n2:14:07.300 --> 2:14:09.660\n stretched out more for curiosity for kids?\n\n2:14:09.660 --> 2:14:12.300\n Or should we try to reset the dopamine hit?\n\n2:14:12.300 --> 2:14:13.500\n And then I don't know.\n\n2:14:13.500 --> 2:14:14.380\n It's an open question.\n\n2:14:14.380 --> 2:14:17.380\n Well, I think it goes to David Foster Wallace,\n\n2:14:17.380 --> 2:14:19.300\n the key to life is to be unboreable.\n\n2:14:19.300 --> 2:14:22.900\n I think you could train this kind of thing, which\n\n2:14:22.900 --> 2:14:28.780\n is in every single situation, which I think is at the core,\n\n2:14:28.780 --> 2:14:30.860\n at least this correlated with curiosity,\n\n2:14:30.860 --> 2:14:36.720\n is in every situation, try to find the exciting,\n\n2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:37.740\n the fascinating.\n\n2:14:37.740 --> 2:14:38.860\n Like in every situation.\n\n2:14:38.860 --> 2:14:40.980\n You sitting at the, I don't know,\n\n2:14:40.980 --> 2:14:43.940\n waiting for something at a DMV or something like that.\n\n2:14:43.940 --> 2:14:47.020\n Find something that excites you, like a thought.\n\n2:14:47.020 --> 2:14:51.420\n Like watch people or start to think about, well,\n\n2:14:51.420 --> 2:14:55.780\n I wonder how many people have to go to the DMV every day.\n\n2:14:55.780 --> 2:14:59.700\n And then try to go into the pothead mode of thinking like,\n\n2:14:59.700 --> 2:15:02.060\n wow, isn't this weird that there's a bunch of people\n\n2:15:02.060 --> 2:15:05.500\n that are having to get a stamp of approval\n\n2:15:05.500 --> 2:15:07.620\n from the government to drive their cars,\n\n2:15:07.620 --> 2:15:09.500\n and then there's millions of cars driving every day.\n\n2:15:09.500 --> 2:15:10.460\n Or like, how can I do this better?\n\n2:15:10.460 --> 2:15:13.180\n Maybe there's some blockchain and they could like VIN transfer.\n\n2:15:13.180 --> 2:15:13.860\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:15:13.860 --> 2:15:14.360\n Yeah.\n\n2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:15.660\n No, that is a good thing.\n\n2:15:15.660 --> 2:15:18.000\n And then every situation, I think\n\n2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:21.500\n if you rigorously just practice that at a young age,\n\n2:15:21.500 --> 2:15:22.980\n I think you can learn to do that.\n\n2:15:22.980 --> 2:15:26.220\n Because sometimes people ask me for advice\n\n2:15:26.220 --> 2:15:29.780\n and to do this thing or that thing.\n\n2:15:29.780 --> 2:15:31.580\n I think you, at the core, really have\n\n2:15:31.580 --> 2:15:36.620\n to have this muscle of finding the awesomeness in everything.\n\n2:15:36.620 --> 2:15:38.580\n Because if you're able to find the awesomeness\n\n2:15:38.580 --> 2:15:40.940\n in everything, like whatever journey you take,\n\n2:15:40.940 --> 2:15:47.340\n whatever weird meandering path that you take through life\n\n2:15:47.340 --> 2:15:50.660\n is going to be productive, is going to end up in a great place.\n\n2:15:50.660 --> 2:15:52.220\n So that muscle is at the core of it.\n\n2:15:52.220 --> 2:15:58.220\n And I guess curiosity is central to that.\n\n2:15:58.220 --> 2:16:02.180\n But you didn't win the Nobel Prize.\n\n2:16:02.180 --> 2:16:05.660\n The team of Bicep that led the Bicep 2\n\n2:16:05.660 --> 2:16:10.260\n didn't win the Nobel Prize because of some space dust.\n\n2:16:10.260 --> 2:16:11.460\n That's right.\n\n2:16:11.460 --> 2:16:13.940\n It's like schmutz.\n\n2:16:13.940 --> 2:16:15.340\n Which one is the moon?\n\n2:16:15.340 --> 2:16:16.060\n Which one is?\n\n2:16:16.060 --> 2:16:17.820\n That one's dust.\n\n2:16:17.820 --> 2:16:20.700\n Space dust, yeah.\n\n2:16:20.700 --> 2:16:21.660\n What are we looking at?\n\n2:16:21.660 --> 2:16:25.940\n So why is space dust the villain of this whole story?\n\n2:16:25.940 --> 2:16:26.820\n Well, it's funny.\n\n2:16:26.820 --> 2:16:27.900\n I wrote these books.\n\n2:16:27.900 --> 2:16:29.700\n And I don't know about you, but when you get all these books,\n\n2:16:29.700 --> 2:16:31.580\n I'm sure you get books, people sending books.\n\n2:16:31.580 --> 2:16:33.460\n They always come in these dust jackets, right?\n\n2:16:33.460 --> 2:16:35.460\n I was always like, what the hell is a dust jacket?\n\n2:16:35.460 --> 2:16:38.220\n How much dust is raining down at any moment?\n\n2:16:38.220 --> 2:16:39.260\n I mean, this is immaculate.\n\n2:16:39.260 --> 2:16:41.500\n This room is Russian tidiness galore.\n\n2:16:41.500 --> 2:16:44.220\n But in a normal household, how much dust is raining down?\n\n2:16:44.220 --> 2:16:47.340\n It's not really pretty until I wrote a book.\n\n2:16:47.340 --> 2:16:50.220\n And I realized I'm writing a story about the origin\n\n2:16:50.220 --> 2:16:54.260\n of the universe, the prologue to the cosmos.\n\n2:16:54.260 --> 2:16:58.180\n And dust is going to cover this story.\n\n2:16:58.180 --> 2:17:01.820\n It's actually more a story about astrophysics and cosmology\n\n2:17:01.820 --> 2:17:02.320\n than dust.\n\n2:17:02.320 --> 2:17:05.620\n And this is the link between the cosmological and the\n\n2:17:05.620 --> 2:17:06.300\n astrophysical.\n\n2:17:06.300 --> 2:17:07.300\n So what does that mean?\n\n2:17:07.300 --> 2:17:09.100\n So astrophysics is, broadly speaking,\n\n2:17:09.100 --> 2:17:13.100\n the study of physical phenomena manifest in the heavens,\n\n2:17:13.100 --> 2:17:14.820\n astronomical phenomena.\n\n2:17:14.820 --> 2:17:17.200\n Cosmology is concerned with the origin, evolution,\n\n2:17:17.200 --> 2:17:18.820\n composition of the universe as a whole.\n\n2:17:18.820 --> 2:17:21.460\n But it's not really concerned with stars, galaxies,\n\n2:17:21.460 --> 2:17:24.540\n and planets per se, other than how they might help us measure\n\n2:17:24.540 --> 2:17:26.780\n the Hubble constant, the density of the universe,\n\n2:17:26.780 --> 2:17:29.300\n the neutrino content, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n2:17:29.300 --> 2:17:31.700\n So we have a tendency to kind of look a little bit,\n\n2:17:31.700 --> 2:17:34.180\n you know, they're like, not all astronomers\n\n2:17:34.180 --> 2:17:35.420\n and astrophysicists are equal.\n\n2:17:35.420 --> 2:17:37.420\n They're all equal, but some are more equal than others.\n\n2:17:37.420 --> 2:17:40.040\n So we have kind of a prejudice, a little swagger, right?\n\n2:17:40.040 --> 2:17:42.380\n And cosmologists are studying, you know, we're using Einstein.\n\n2:17:42.380 --> 2:17:44.420\n We're not using, like, you know, Boltzmann.\n\n2:17:44.420 --> 2:17:46.880\n We're thinking of the biggest possible pictures.\n\n2:17:46.880 --> 2:17:49.360\n In so doing, you can actually become\n\n2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:52.840\n blinded to otherwise obvious effects\n\n2:17:52.840 --> 2:17:55.980\n that people would have not overlooked.\n\n2:17:55.980 --> 2:17:58.620\n In our case, when we sought out the signal,\n\n2:17:58.620 --> 2:18:02.180\n we were using the photons that make up this primordial heat\n\n2:18:02.180 --> 2:18:03.700\n bath that surrounds the universe,\n\n2:18:03.700 --> 2:18:06.380\n luckily only at three degrees Kelvin approximately.\n\n2:18:06.380 --> 2:18:08.260\n We're using those as a type of film\n\n2:18:08.260 --> 2:18:11.220\n onto which gravitational waves will reverberate it,\n\n2:18:11.220 --> 2:18:12.820\n make them oscillate preferentially\n\n2:18:12.820 --> 2:18:14.180\n in a polarized way.\n\n2:18:14.180 --> 2:18:16.140\n And then we can use our polarized sunglasses,\n\n2:18:16.140 --> 2:18:18.860\n but in a microwave format, to detect\n\n2:18:18.860 --> 2:18:20.520\n the characteristic twofold symmetry\n\n2:18:20.520 --> 2:18:22.500\n pattern of underrotation.\n\n2:18:22.500 --> 2:18:24.220\n That's the technical way that we undergo it.\n\n2:18:24.220 --> 2:18:26.200\n I mean, there's a lot more to it.\n\n2:18:26.200 --> 2:18:27.900\n But there are more than one thing\n\n2:18:27.900 --> 2:18:29.580\n that can mimic exactly that signal.\n\n2:18:29.580 --> 2:18:31.780\n First of all, when you look at the signal,\n\n2:18:31.780 --> 2:18:34.240\n the signal if inflation took place, big if,\n\n2:18:34.240 --> 2:18:36.580\n but if it took place, the signal would\n\n2:18:36.580 --> 2:18:41.780\n be about one or two parts per billion of the CMB temperature\n\n2:18:41.780 --> 2:18:43.140\n itself.\n\n2:18:43.140 --> 2:18:45.460\n So a few nanokelvin.\n\n2:18:45.460 --> 2:18:47.020\n The CMB is a few kelvin.\n\n2:18:47.020 --> 2:18:50.540\n The signal from these B modes would be a few nanokelvin.\n\n2:18:50.540 --> 2:18:52.180\n It's astonishing to think.\n\n2:18:52.180 --> 2:18:54.700\n Penzias and Wilson, 1965, measured\n\n2:18:54.700 --> 2:18:58.020\n something that's a billion times brighter.\n\n2:18:58.020 --> 2:18:59.900\n And that was what, 60 years ago?\n\n2:18:59.900 --> 2:19:02.540\n Let's call it 60 years ago, since they discovered it.\n\n2:19:02.540 --> 2:19:04.340\n Moore's law, you're more expert now.\n\n2:19:04.340 --> 2:19:05.980\n Let's call it every two years.\n\n2:19:05.980 --> 2:19:09.180\n So you're talking about like 2 to the 30th power doubling\n\n2:19:09.180 --> 2:19:10.660\n or something like that at that.\n\n2:19:10.660 --> 2:19:12.740\n Let's call it 2 to the 20th, something like that.\n\n2:19:12.740 --> 2:19:17.140\n So that's like only 2 to the 10th is 1,000.\n\n2:19:17.140 --> 2:19:18.380\n Correct my math, I'm wrong.\n\n2:19:18.380 --> 2:19:20.380\n 2 to the 20th is a million.\n\n2:19:20.380 --> 2:19:22.020\n 2 to the 30th is a billion.\n\n2:19:22.020 --> 2:19:25.780\n So we're outpacing Moore's law in terms\n\n2:19:25.780 --> 2:19:27.500\n of the sensitivity of our instruments\n\n2:19:27.500 --> 2:19:30.380\n to detect these feeble signals from the cosmos.\n\n2:19:30.380 --> 2:19:31.860\n And they don't have to deal with,\n\n2:19:31.860 --> 2:19:35.180\n in the semiconductor factory in Santa Clara, California,\n\n2:19:35.180 --> 2:19:38.140\n they don't have to deal with meteorites and things\n\n2:19:38.140 --> 2:19:39.780\n like coming into the laboratory.\n\n2:19:39.780 --> 2:19:40.460\n It's a clean room.\n\n2:19:40.460 --> 2:19:41.140\n It's pristine.\n\n2:19:41.140 --> 2:19:42.780\n They can control everything about it.\n\n2:19:42.780 --> 2:19:44.700\n We can't control the cosmos.\n\n2:19:44.700 --> 2:19:46.420\n And the cosmos is literally littered\n\n2:19:46.420 --> 2:19:50.540\n with particles of schmutz, of failed planets, asteroids,\n\n2:19:50.540 --> 2:19:52.460\n meteoroids, things that didn't coalesce\n\n2:19:52.460 --> 2:19:56.900\n to make either the Earth, the moon, the planet Jupiter,\n\n2:19:56.900 --> 2:19:58.660\n or its moons, or get sucked into them\n\n2:19:58.660 --> 2:20:00.980\n and make craters on them, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n2:20:00.980 --> 2:20:04.260\n The rest of it is falling, and it comes in a power spectrum.\n\n2:20:04.260 --> 2:20:07.820\n There's very few, thank god, Chicxulub sized impact\n\n2:20:07.820 --> 2:20:11.900\n or progenitors that will take out all life on Earth.\n\n2:20:11.900 --> 2:20:13.540\n But there's extremely large number\n\n2:20:13.540 --> 2:20:16.580\n of tiny dust particles and microscopic grains.\n\n2:20:16.580 --> 2:20:18.940\n And then there's a fair number of intermediate sized\n\n2:20:18.940 --> 2:20:19.740\n particles.\n\n2:20:19.740 --> 2:20:21.980\n And it turns out this little guy here\n\n2:20:21.980 --> 2:20:26.900\n is the end product of a collapsing star that\n\n2:20:26.900 --> 2:20:30.140\n explodes in what's called a supernova, type II supernova.\n\n2:20:30.140 --> 2:20:31.860\n So stars spend most of their life\n\n2:20:31.860 --> 2:20:39.180\n using helium nuclei protons and neutrons into helium nuclei.\n\n2:20:39.180 --> 2:20:41.820\n And then from there, it can make other things like beryllium\n\n2:20:41.820 --> 2:20:45.220\n and briefly make beryllium and carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,\n\n2:20:45.220 --> 2:20:48.780\n all the way up until it tries to make iron and nickel.\n\n2:20:48.780 --> 2:20:50.700\n And iron and nickel are endothermic.\n\n2:20:50.700 --> 2:20:52.780\n It takes more energy than gets liberated\n\n2:20:52.780 --> 2:20:55.900\n to make an atom of iron.\n\n2:20:55.900 --> 2:20:58.740\n When that happens, there's no longer enough heat supplying\n\n2:20:58.740 --> 2:21:01.420\n pressure to resist the gravitational collapse\n\n2:21:01.420 --> 2:21:03.060\n of the material that was produced earlier.\n\n2:21:03.060 --> 2:21:04.980\n So the star forms and goes inside out.\n\n2:21:04.980 --> 2:21:07.460\n That's how scientists discovered helium\n\n2:21:07.460 --> 2:21:08.580\n was discovered on the sun.\n\n2:21:08.580 --> 2:21:08.940\n I don't know.\n\n2:21:08.940 --> 2:21:09.300\n Did you know?\n\n2:21:09.300 --> 2:21:10.660\n That's why it's called helium.\n\n2:21:10.660 --> 2:21:12.060\n Yeah, they went there at night.\n\n2:21:12.060 --> 2:21:14.780\n And they went there at night.\n\n2:21:14.780 --> 2:21:16.780\n No, helium means Helios is the god of the sun.\n\n2:21:16.780 --> 2:21:19.380\n It was discovered in its spectrum from observations\n\n2:21:19.380 --> 2:21:20.980\n of the telescope like 150 years ago.\n\n2:21:20.980 --> 2:21:25.580\n It wasn't discovered like when oxygen and iron was discovered.\n\n2:21:25.580 --> 2:21:28.460\n So it's only a relatively recent comer to the pure activity.\n\n2:21:28.460 --> 2:21:31.220\n So helium came after oxygen.\n\n2:21:31.220 --> 2:21:33.460\n Oh, no, first hydrogen forms into helium.\n\n2:21:33.460 --> 2:21:34.940\n So that's the first thing that formed.\n\n2:21:34.940 --> 2:21:36.340\n No, in terms of discoveries.\n\n2:21:36.340 --> 2:21:37.420\n Oh, yeah, after oxygen.\n\n2:21:37.420 --> 2:21:41.100\n Yeah, I think Priestley and others, Dalton,\n\n2:21:41.100 --> 2:21:42.660\n discovered it in the 1700s.\n\n2:21:42.660 --> 2:21:44.300\n No, helium was really only discovered\n\n2:21:44.300 --> 2:21:45.860\n from the spectrum of looking at the sun\n\n2:21:45.860 --> 2:21:49.140\n and seeing the weird atomic absorption called Fraunhofer\n\n2:21:49.140 --> 2:21:51.660\n lines in the solar spectrum.\n\n2:21:51.660 --> 2:21:54.060\n But when it tries to make iron, there's\n\n2:21:54.060 --> 2:21:55.580\n no longer any leftover heat.\n\n2:21:55.580 --> 2:21:57.860\n In other words, there's heat left over from fusing,\n\n2:21:57.860 --> 2:21:59.700\n as you know, the son of a plasma physicist.\n\n2:21:59.700 --> 2:22:03.380\n You fuse to a hydrogen nuclei, you get excess energy,\n\n2:22:03.380 --> 2:22:04.340\n plus you get helium.\n\n2:22:04.340 --> 2:22:05.700\n So that's why fusion energy could\n\n2:22:05.700 --> 2:22:08.420\n be the energy source of the future and always will be.\n\n2:22:08.420 --> 2:22:09.260\n No, no, I don't know.\n\n2:22:09.260 --> 2:22:11.420\n Hopefully, it'll come much sooner than that.\n\n2:22:11.420 --> 2:22:13.940\n In so doing, trying to make iron, it takes more energy,\n\n2:22:13.940 --> 2:22:16.740\n doesn't give off enough energy, star collapses, explodes.\n\n2:22:16.740 --> 2:22:20.100\n And what does it spray out into the cosmic interstellar medium?\n\n2:22:20.100 --> 2:22:22.820\n It sprays out the last thing it made, which is that stuff.\n\n2:22:22.820 --> 2:22:24.540\n Luckily for us, because some of that\n\n2:22:24.540 --> 2:22:26.820\n coalesced and made the core of the Earth,\n\n2:22:26.820 --> 2:22:30.180\n onto which the lighter, like silica and carbon and the dirt\n\n2:22:30.180 --> 2:22:31.820\n and the crust of the Earth were formed.\n\n2:22:31.820 --> 2:22:33.660\n And some of that made its way to the crust.\n\n2:22:33.660 --> 2:22:35.420\n The iron made its way to the crust.\n\n2:22:35.420 --> 2:22:38.260\n Some of that your mother ate and synthesized\n\n2:22:38.260 --> 2:22:39.540\n hemoglobin molecules.\n\n2:22:39.540 --> 2:22:41.380\n And hemoglobin has iron particles in it.\n\n2:22:41.380 --> 2:22:43.140\n It's a quite amazing substance.\n\n2:22:43.140 --> 2:22:44.820\n Without it, we wouldn't have our red blood.\n\n2:22:44.820 --> 2:22:47.380\n We wouldn't exist as we are.\n\n2:22:47.380 --> 2:22:51.220\n Is this a very long, complicated mom joke?\n\n2:22:51.220 --> 2:22:52.260\n I've done enough dad jokes.\n\n2:22:52.260 --> 2:22:53.820\n My quota's up.\n\n2:22:53.820 --> 2:22:58.220\n So taking this object seriously, not all of it\n\n2:22:58.220 --> 2:22:59.260\n gets bound up in a planet.\n\n2:22:59.260 --> 2:23:01.940\n In fact, forming planets is very inefficient.\n\n2:23:01.940 --> 2:23:03.660\n And so there's a lot of schmutz left over,\n\n2:23:03.660 --> 2:23:07.100\n some of which gets in the way of our telescopes looking back\n\n2:23:07.100 --> 2:23:08.660\n to the beginning of time.\n\n2:23:08.660 --> 2:23:10.420\n And some of those molecules, like iron,\n\n2:23:10.420 --> 2:23:12.140\n is used in compass needles.\n\n2:23:12.140 --> 2:23:13.380\n They're magnetized.\n\n2:23:13.380 --> 2:23:15.660\n And magnetic fields in our galaxy\n\n2:23:15.660 --> 2:23:18.140\n can align them and make the exact polarization pattern\n\n2:23:18.140 --> 2:23:21.020\n that we're looking for, as if the compass needles get\n\n2:23:21.020 --> 2:23:21.740\n all aligned.\n\n2:23:21.740 --> 2:23:24.200\n That's like the polarization of the dust grain.\n\n2:23:24.200 --> 2:23:26.260\n It's like that polarizing filter.\n\n2:23:26.260 --> 2:23:29.060\n That means light polarized like this will get absorbed.\n\n2:23:29.060 --> 2:23:30.900\n And light polarized like this will go through.\n\n2:23:30.900 --> 2:23:31.700\n So it's absorbing.\n\n2:23:31.700 --> 2:23:33.540\n It's making 100% polarized light out\n\n2:23:33.540 --> 2:23:35.820\n of an initially unpolarized light source.\n\n2:23:35.820 --> 2:23:36.900\n And that's what happened.\n\n2:23:36.900 --> 2:23:43.460\n And what we ended up claiming on March 17, and I'm sure\n\n2:23:43.460 --> 2:23:45.380\n if you were there, you might remember this.\n\n2:23:45.380 --> 2:23:47.260\n At the Harvard Center for Astrophysics,\n\n2:23:47.260 --> 2:23:48.300\n there was an announcement.\n\n2:23:48.300 --> 2:23:50.260\n There were like three or four Nobel Prize winners\n\n2:23:50.260 --> 2:23:50.980\n in the audience.\n\n2:23:50.980 --> 2:23:53.660\n And the BICEP2 team, which I was no longer leading,\n\n2:23:53.660 --> 2:23:55.100\n I was still a member of it.\n\n2:23:55.100 --> 2:23:57.980\n In fact, in the announcement, the first person they mentioned,\n\n2:23:57.980 --> 2:24:00.260\n besides thank you all for being here,\n\n2:24:00.260 --> 2:24:02.500\n is me and my team at UC San Diego.\n\n2:24:02.500 --> 2:24:05.220\n Although I wasn't invited to go to the press conference\n\n2:24:05.220 --> 2:24:07.700\n because that was very complicated.\n\n2:24:07.700 --> 2:24:09.380\n Yes, exactly.\n\n2:24:09.380 --> 2:24:12.900\n It's a little school up there in the Cambridge area.\n\n2:24:12.900 --> 2:24:15.540\n And so they ended up making this announcement\n\n2:24:15.540 --> 2:24:18.220\n that we had discovered the aftershocks of inflation.\n\n2:24:18.220 --> 2:24:21.900\n We detected the gravitational waves shaking up the CMB.\n\n2:24:21.900 --> 2:24:24.600\n And on that day, past Lex Friedman's podcast\n\n2:24:24.600 --> 2:24:26.620\n back when it was called Artificial Intelligence,\n\n2:24:26.620 --> 2:24:29.220\n Max Tegmark said, goodbye, universe.\n\n2:24:29.220 --> 2:24:30.300\n Hello, multiverse.\n\n2:24:30.300 --> 2:24:32.380\n And hello, Nobel Prize.\n\n2:24:32.380 --> 2:24:36.300\n He saw that as confirmatory evidence, not only of inflation,\n\n2:24:36.300 --> 2:24:39.180\n not only of gravitational waves, but of the multiverse.\n\n2:24:39.180 --> 2:24:40.340\n Goodbye, universe.\n\n2:24:40.340 --> 2:24:41.780\n Hello, multiverse.\n\n2:24:41.780 --> 2:24:44.460\n Multiverse is a natural consequence.\n\n2:24:44.460 --> 2:24:46.260\n Consequence of inflation, yes.\n\n2:24:46.260 --> 2:24:49.580\n According to its prominent supporters, yeah.\n\n2:24:49.580 --> 2:24:51.900\n Yeah, and of course, leave the poetry to Max,\n\n2:24:51.900 --> 2:24:54.220\n which he does masterfully.\n\n2:24:54.220 --> 2:24:58.340\n OK, so the excitement was there.\n\n2:24:58.340 --> 2:25:01.780\n I mean, maybe the initial heartbreak for you\n\n2:25:01.780 --> 2:25:02.500\n was there, too.\n\n2:25:02.500 --> 2:25:04.980\n That's some of the darker moments you're going through.\n\n2:25:04.980 --> 2:25:07.860\n But broadly, for the space of science,\n\n2:25:07.860 --> 2:25:09.060\n there's excitement there.\n\n2:25:09.060 --> 2:25:09.860\n Huge excitement.\n\n2:25:09.860 --> 2:25:13.500\n And I often note that this is a problem in what I call\n\n2:25:13.500 --> 2:25:15.100\n the science media complex.\n\n2:25:15.100 --> 2:25:17.860\n Because oftentimes, you'll see things like past guess\n\n2:25:17.860 --> 2:25:21.500\n Sarah Seager, Venus life exist.\n\n2:25:21.500 --> 2:25:23.820\n And that will be really, I mean, it's fascinating, right,\n\n2:25:23.820 --> 2:25:26.580\n with the work that she's doing or her colleagues are doing,\n\n2:25:26.580 --> 2:25:28.280\n Clara, who's on your show as well.\n\n2:25:28.280 --> 2:25:31.660\n And that will be on front page, New York Times, Boston\n\n2:25:31.660 --> 2:25:34.260\n Globe, San Diego Union Tribune.\n\n2:25:34.260 --> 2:25:35.780\n It'll be above the fold.\n\n2:25:35.780 --> 2:25:37.140\n Make headlines around the world.\n\n2:25:37.140 --> 2:25:40.220\n And then six months, 12 months later, as is the case for us,\n\n2:25:40.220 --> 2:25:41.220\n retraction.\n\n2:25:41.220 --> 2:25:45.260\n Page C17 of the Saturday edition that nobody reads\n\n2:25:45.260 --> 2:25:47.300\n and underneath the personal.\n\n2:25:47.300 --> 2:25:52.740\n So we have a problem in science, that if it explodes, it leads.\n\n2:25:52.740 --> 2:25:54.680\n And we get this huge fanfare.\n\n2:25:54.680 --> 2:25:56.940\n And this is not unique to my experiment.\n\n2:25:56.940 --> 2:25:58.620\n This happened with the earlier discovery\n\n2:25:58.620 --> 2:26:02.220\n of so called Martian life discovered\n\n2:26:02.220 --> 2:26:06.060\n in Antarctica, which was announced after peer review.\n\n2:26:06.060 --> 2:26:07.640\n We weren't peer reviewed at the point\n\n2:26:07.640 --> 2:26:08.500\n when we made the announcement.\n\n2:26:08.500 --> 2:26:09.600\n We had a press conference.\n\n2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:12.100\n And there are other reasons that the team leaders felt\n\n2:26:12.100 --> 2:26:14.460\n it was important to do that so that we don't get scooped\n\n2:26:14.460 --> 2:26:15.900\n by a referee who's unethical.\n\n2:26:15.900 --> 2:26:17.180\n We thought we had done everything right,\n\n2:26:17.180 --> 2:26:18.260\n but that's confirmation bias.\n\n2:26:18.260 --> 2:26:20.020\n So there's levels to this.\n\n2:26:20.020 --> 2:26:21.860\n Yeah, there were many levels.\n\n2:26:21.860 --> 2:26:23.820\n And there were people, me warning\n\n2:26:23.820 --> 2:26:25.200\n about how it would be interpreted\n\n2:26:25.200 --> 2:26:28.260\n and wanting to also make sure that we put all the data out,\n\n2:26:28.260 --> 2:26:30.380\n including the maps, which we still haven't released.\n\n2:26:30.380 --> 2:26:33.120\n And so there were a lot of reasons to be skeptical.\n\n2:26:33.120 --> 2:26:37.380\n But the public never knows this.\n\n2:26:37.380 --> 2:26:39.380\n So I've made a rule that if I am ever\n\n2:26:39.380 --> 2:26:43.020\n in charge of doling out large amounts of science funding,\n\n2:26:43.020 --> 2:26:45.660\n that you should keep kind of an option.\n\n2:26:45.660 --> 2:26:47.900\n In other words, you should have money for publicity.\n\n2:26:47.900 --> 2:26:48.720\n It's fine.\n\n2:26:48.720 --> 2:26:50.220\n Have money for your press conference.\n\n2:26:50.220 --> 2:26:54.180\n But hold in reserve in a bond to be used, hopefully never,\n\n2:26:54.180 --> 2:26:58.340\n but if it's to be used, an equal fund for the retraction,\n\n2:26:58.340 --> 2:26:59.860\n if it should occur.\n\n2:26:59.860 --> 2:27:01.700\n So you would like to see,\n\n2:27:01.700 --> 2:27:04.820\n because that's a big part of transparency, is the...\n\n2:27:06.180 --> 2:27:08.580\n To me, in the space of science at least,\n\n2:27:08.580 --> 2:27:13.100\n that's as beautiful, because it reveals the...\n\n2:27:13.100 --> 2:27:15.220\n It tells a great story.\n\n2:27:15.220 --> 2:27:18.340\n There's an excitement, there's a...\n\n2:27:18.340 --> 2:27:19.180\n Humanity.\n\n2:27:20.060 --> 2:27:21.660\n So there's a climax to the triumph,\n\n2:27:21.660 --> 2:27:25.420\n but there's also a climax to the disappointment at the end.\n\n2:27:25.420 --> 2:27:29.540\n Because that also eventually leads to triumph again.\n\n2:27:29.540 --> 2:27:32.540\n That sets up, that's the drama that sets up the triumph.\n\n2:27:32.540 --> 2:27:37.180\n Like with Andrew Wiles performing Fermat's theorem,\n\n2:27:37.180 --> 2:27:39.020\n I guess it's not the last thing, whatever.\n\n2:27:41.060 --> 2:27:43.580\n Like the ups and downs of that, the rollercoaster,\n\n2:27:43.580 --> 2:27:44.420\n the whole thing should be documented.\n\n2:27:44.420 --> 2:27:45.260\n That is science.\n\n2:27:45.260 --> 2:27:46.220\n That is science.\n\n2:27:46.220 --> 2:27:49.020\n And when we don't do that, then we cultivate this aura\n\n2:27:49.020 --> 2:27:51.060\n that excludes other scientists.\n\n2:27:51.060 --> 2:27:53.140\n Often from minorities or women,\n\n2:27:53.140 --> 2:27:54.460\n that you have to be Einstein.\n\n2:27:54.460 --> 2:27:55.820\n Like Einstein came out of the womb,\n\n2:27:55.820 --> 2:27:57.460\n and he was just like this guy with like curly...\n\n2:27:57.460 --> 2:27:58.580\n No, he wasn't.\n\n2:27:58.580 --> 2:28:00.220\n He wasn't bad at math.\n\n2:28:00.220 --> 2:28:01.740\n That's all nonsense.\n\n2:28:01.740 --> 2:28:02.900\n But he said that he...\n\n2:28:02.900 --> 2:28:05.180\n You know what he said he attributed his success to, Lex?\n\n2:28:05.180 --> 2:28:08.620\n He said, I never asked my dad what happened\n\n2:28:08.620 --> 2:28:11.460\n when I ran alongside a light beam as a kid.\n\n2:28:11.460 --> 2:28:12.420\n And thank God I didn't.\n\n2:28:12.420 --> 2:28:13.380\n Because had I?\n\n2:28:13.380 --> 2:28:15.620\n He would have told me the best answer of the day,\n\n2:28:15.620 --> 2:28:18.900\n which by the way, he would create 20 years later\n\n2:28:18.900 --> 2:28:21.500\n as a 26 year old in the patent office,\n\n2:28:21.500 --> 2:28:22.740\n obviously in Switzerland.\n\n2:28:22.740 --> 2:28:26.100\n And in so doing, by delaying when he asked these questions,\n\n2:28:26.100 --> 2:28:28.660\n he said, I approached it with the intellect\n\n2:28:28.660 --> 2:28:31.620\n of a mature scientist, not a little kid.\n\n2:28:31.620 --> 2:28:34.100\n And I wouldn't have accepted the same explanation.\n\n2:28:34.100 --> 2:28:37.300\n So sometimes assuming that scientists are infallible,\n\n2:28:37.300 --> 2:28:40.220\n inevitable, omniscient being,\n\n2:28:40.220 --> 2:28:41.620\n I think that really does a disservice.\n\n2:28:41.620 --> 2:28:42.860\n And Jim Gates said, he's like,\n\n2:28:42.860 --> 2:28:45.020\n Einstein wasn't always Einstein.\n\n2:28:45.020 --> 2:28:47.980\n And we cultivate this mystery and allure at our peril\n\n2:28:47.980 --> 2:28:51.740\n because we're humans until we have artificial Einstein,\n\n2:28:51.740 --> 2:28:54.100\n which I don't think will ever exist.\n\n2:28:54.100 --> 2:28:58.020\n You've launched the assay or project\n\n2:28:58.020 --> 2:28:59.620\n where you hope to assess theories\n\n2:28:59.620 --> 2:29:01.820\n of everything with experiments.\n\n2:29:01.820 --> 2:29:03.860\n You have a YouTube video where you were announcing that.\n\n2:29:03.860 --> 2:29:06.300\n That looks super cool.\n\n2:29:06.300 --> 2:29:07.820\n Can you describe this project?\n\n2:29:07.820 --> 2:29:09.060\n And you also mentioned kind of,\n\n2:29:09.060 --> 2:29:11.940\n you give a shout out to a little known fellow\n\n2:29:11.940 --> 2:29:14.300\n by the name of Galileo Galilei\n\n2:29:14.300 --> 2:29:17.180\n as an inspiration to this project.\n\n2:29:17.180 --> 2:29:20.340\n Yeah, so Galileo is kind of my avatar,\n\n2:29:20.340 --> 2:29:23.060\n my hero, the kind of all around scientist\n\n2:29:23.060 --> 2:29:27.620\n that I would love to approach the logarithm of Galileo.\n\n2:29:27.620 --> 2:29:31.020\n He was not only a phenomenal scientist,\n\n2:29:31.020 --> 2:29:35.380\n he was an incredible artist, a writer, a poet,\n\n2:29:35.380 --> 2:29:38.260\n a philosopher, and back then they didn't have distinctions\n\n2:29:38.260 --> 2:29:40.780\n between a scientist and a physician,\n\n2:29:40.780 --> 2:29:41.820\n was like a physicist.\n\n2:29:42.940 --> 2:29:46.220\n And he would indulge kind of these really\n\n2:29:46.220 --> 2:29:48.180\n intellectual flights of fancy,\n\n2:29:48.180 --> 2:29:52.500\n thinking about phenomena such as the Earth's tides\n\n2:29:52.500 --> 2:29:55.300\n or the composition of the Milky Way.\n\n2:29:55.300 --> 2:29:57.140\n And what's interesting about Galileo\n\n2:29:57.140 --> 2:30:00.860\n is that he was almost as wrong often as he was right.\n\n2:30:00.860 --> 2:30:03.500\n And Galileo was not alone like this.\n\n2:30:03.500 --> 2:30:07.540\n I always say like Einstein had at least seven Nobel prizes\n\n2:30:07.540 --> 2:30:09.380\n that he could have won for discoveries\n\n2:30:09.380 --> 2:30:10.660\n that later became true,\n\n2:30:10.660 --> 2:30:15.260\n but he also had seven huge impossible to believe blunders\n\n2:30:15.260 --> 2:30:16.940\n in some sense.\n\n2:30:16.940 --> 2:30:17.780\n That's too bad,\n\n2:30:17.780 --> 2:30:19.500\n because he could have had a good career as I would say.\n\n2:30:19.500 --> 2:30:21.300\n And Galileo was like that too.\n\n2:30:21.300 --> 2:30:23.380\n In other words, he would fall victim\n\n2:30:23.380 --> 2:30:25.980\n to I think this confirmation bias\n\n2:30:25.980 --> 2:30:29.140\n that all scientists have to guard their lives against,\n\n2:30:29.140 --> 2:30:32.020\n their careers, their brands, their reputations against,\n\n2:30:32.020 --> 2:30:34.980\n which is the exclusion of evidence that doesn't conform\n\n2:30:34.980 --> 2:30:38.380\n to what you're trying to prove for one reason or another,\n\n2:30:38.380 --> 2:30:40.620\n or the radical acceptance of things\n\n2:30:40.620 --> 2:30:43.740\n that do comport with it in order to bolster your confidence.\n\n2:30:43.740 --> 2:30:45.620\n And both are equally intoxicating.\n\n2:30:45.620 --> 2:30:49.300\n It's a confirmation bias is a hell of a drug\n\n2:30:49.300 --> 2:30:53.060\n because it really reinforces this notion,\n\n2:30:53.060 --> 2:30:54.540\n which is partially sunk cost.\n\n2:30:54.540 --> 2:30:57.460\n You put so much time, effort, money, reputation into it.\n\n2:30:57.460 --> 2:30:59.540\n You don't wanna be wrong and go back on it.\n\n2:30:59.540 --> 2:31:04.540\n And with Galileo, he would be incredibly perceptive\n\n2:31:04.940 --> 2:31:09.460\n about things such as the Earth being not located\n\n2:31:09.460 --> 2:31:11.060\n at the center of the solar system\n\n2:31:11.060 --> 2:31:12.420\n and the sun being the center,\n\n2:31:12.420 --> 2:31:14.260\n the so called Copernican hypothesis.\n\n2:31:15.220 --> 2:31:19.260\n And he would use as evidence very, very interesting ideas\n\n2:31:19.260 --> 2:31:21.020\n that all of which were wrong, basically.\n\n2:31:21.020 --> 2:31:22.940\n And in fact, we weren't able to prove\n\n2:31:22.940 --> 2:31:25.140\n that the Earth orbited around the sun.\n\n2:31:25.140 --> 2:31:28.460\n And I ask you, can you prove the Earth is not flat?\n\n2:31:28.460 --> 2:31:30.140\n No, well, you're a flat earther anyway.\n\n2:31:30.140 --> 2:31:31.940\n But I ask my practice.\n\n2:31:31.940 --> 2:31:34.900\n Proud Flat Earth Society member,\n\n2:31:34.900 --> 2:31:36.900\n T shirts coming out soon.\n\n2:31:36.900 --> 2:31:38.340\n Let's stream it.com.\n\n2:31:38.340 --> 2:31:39.180\n Merch.\n\n2:31:39.180 --> 2:31:40.700\n Last merch.\n\n2:31:40.700 --> 2:31:42.180\n But it's actually not trivial to do that.\n\n2:31:42.180 --> 2:31:43.620\n But most of my students, graduate students\n\n2:31:43.620 --> 2:31:45.140\n can prove that the Earth is round\n\n2:31:45.140 --> 2:31:46.100\n or explain how the Earth.\n\n2:31:46.100 --> 2:31:48.020\n It is actually not trivial to do though.\n\n2:31:48.020 --> 2:31:48.860\n It's not.\n\n2:31:48.860 --> 2:31:49.700\n Yeah.\n\n2:31:49.700 --> 2:31:50.540\n And much harder is to prove\n\n2:31:50.540 --> 2:31:51.660\n that the Earth goes around the sun.\n\n2:31:51.660 --> 2:31:53.220\n In fact, that's extremely hard to prove.\n\n2:31:53.220 --> 2:31:54.860\n And almost none of my students,\n\n2:31:54.860 --> 2:31:57.260\n even after they get their PhD and the final exam,\n\n2:31:57.260 --> 2:31:59.700\n I kinda like to just give them a little bit of humility.\n\n2:31:59.700 --> 2:32:01.380\n Cause I think to be a good scientist,\n\n2:32:01.380 --> 2:32:02.300\n you need to be humble.\n\n2:32:02.300 --> 2:32:03.620\n You need to have a little humility\n\n2:32:03.620 --> 2:32:05.140\n and you need to have swagger.\n\n2:32:05.140 --> 2:32:06.460\n You need to feel like a little cocky.\n\n2:32:06.460 --> 2:32:07.380\n Like I could do this.\n\n2:32:07.380 --> 2:32:10.260\n I can do this thing that Einstein by definition couldn't do.\n\n2:32:10.260 --> 2:32:11.340\n I'm gonna attempt it.\n\n2:32:11.340 --> 2:32:13.620\n I'm gonna attempt to do what was impossible\n\n2:32:13.620 --> 2:32:15.220\n just a generation ago.\n\n2:32:15.220 --> 2:32:18.500\n How do you prove that the Earth goes around the sun?\n\n2:32:18.500 --> 2:32:22.180\n Do you have to, is it by the motion of other planets?\n\n2:32:22.180 --> 2:32:23.380\n So there are many ways to do it.\n\n2:32:23.380 --> 2:32:24.820\n I mean, obviously you could take a spaceship,\n\n2:32:24.820 --> 2:32:28.060\n park it at the North celestial pole of our solar system\n\n2:32:28.060 --> 2:32:30.140\n and just watch what happens.\n\n2:32:30.140 --> 2:32:31.820\n But obviously that wasn't how it was discovered\n\n2:32:31.820 --> 2:32:32.860\n in the late 1700s.\n\n2:32:32.860 --> 2:32:34.460\n So it was called aberration.\n\n2:32:34.460 --> 2:32:36.660\n So if you look at stars,\n\n2:32:36.660 --> 2:32:39.620\n as the Earth orbits around the sun,\n\n2:32:39.620 --> 2:32:41.980\n the position of the stars will shift slightly\n\n2:32:41.980 --> 2:32:43.300\n because of the tilt of the Earth\n\n2:32:43.300 --> 2:32:45.340\n and because the Earth is in motion around the Earth\n\n2:32:45.340 --> 2:32:46.700\n and around the sun.\n\n2:32:46.700 --> 2:32:50.500\n And because the Earth has a non trivial amount of velocity\n\n2:32:50.500 --> 2:32:53.700\n compared to the speed of light in its orbit around the sun,\n\n2:32:53.700 --> 2:32:55.900\n the stars will trace out little tiny ellipses\n\n2:32:55.900 --> 2:32:57.500\n and those will correspond to the fact\n\n2:32:57.500 --> 2:32:59.180\n that we're moving around.\n\n2:32:59.180 --> 2:33:00.580\n If they're infinite distance,\n\n2:33:00.580 --> 2:33:02.180\n which we assume that they are, they're not really,\n\n2:33:02.180 --> 2:33:03.740\n but for all intents and purposes\n\n2:33:03.740 --> 2:33:06.100\n in the scale of the solar system, they're infinitely far away.\n\n2:33:06.100 --> 2:33:08.140\n So that's called stellar aberration.\n\n2:33:08.140 --> 2:33:10.580\n And that was the first way it was discovered.\n\n2:33:10.580 --> 2:33:11.820\n And actually we still use that.\n\n2:33:11.820 --> 2:33:13.260\n We have to correct for that effect\n\n2:33:13.260 --> 2:33:16.060\n when we measure the cosmic microwave background.\n\n2:33:16.060 --> 2:33:18.340\n Because imagine you're inside of an oven,\n\n2:33:18.340 --> 2:33:19.780\n it has some temperature three Kelvin\n\n2:33:19.780 --> 2:33:21.100\n and a thousand Kelvin whenever.\n\n2:33:21.100 --> 2:33:22.740\n If you're moving towards you,\n\n2:33:22.740 --> 2:33:24.500\n the photons that are coming to me in that direction\n\n2:33:24.500 --> 2:33:26.140\n will be blue shifted hotter\n\n2:33:26.140 --> 2:33:27.980\n and the ones behind me will be red shifted.\n\n2:33:27.980 --> 2:33:30.860\n I'll artificially impute a greater or lesser amount\n\n2:33:30.860 --> 2:33:32.620\n of matter or energy where you are\n\n2:33:32.620 --> 2:33:34.780\n and it's an extension of the Doppler effect.\n\n2:33:34.780 --> 2:33:36.460\n So we actually make use of that\n\n2:33:36.460 --> 2:33:39.540\n and construct what's called like a local standard of rest.\n\n2:33:39.540 --> 2:33:41.100\n Anyway, so you can do it.\n\n2:33:41.100 --> 2:33:42.340\n But Galileo said, no, no, no,\n\n2:33:42.340 --> 2:33:43.860\n I'm not gonna wait for that.\n\n2:33:43.860 --> 2:33:45.780\n I have other proofs for it.\n\n2:33:45.780 --> 2:33:47.780\n One of which is that the earth has tides\n\n2:33:47.780 --> 2:33:50.100\n and the tides come in and out twice a day,\n\n2:33:50.100 --> 2:33:51.420\n high tide and low tide.\n\n2:33:51.420 --> 2:33:53.420\n And he made the analogy,\n\n2:33:53.420 --> 2:33:56.180\n because the earth is moving around the sun,\n\n2:33:56.180 --> 2:33:57.380\n say this is the sun here,\n\n2:33:57.380 --> 2:33:58.860\n and it's moving around the sun,\n\n2:33:58.860 --> 2:34:00.460\n but it's also rotating on its axis.\n\n2:34:00.460 --> 2:34:02.380\n See how the water is sloshing up and down\n\n2:34:02.380 --> 2:34:04.740\n inside the vodka bottle?\n\n2:34:04.740 --> 2:34:05.660\n As that happens, he said,\n\n2:34:05.660 --> 2:34:06.860\n that's what the tides are caused by.\n\n2:34:06.860 --> 2:34:07.700\n Totally wrong.\n\n2:34:07.700 --> 2:34:09.260\n Most people listen to this podcast.\n\n2:34:09.260 --> 2:34:12.300\n Just so you know, if you're listening to this,\n\n2:34:12.300 --> 2:34:14.780\n he actually has a bottle of vodka in his hand.\n\n2:34:14.780 --> 2:34:15.820\n Half drunk.\n\n2:34:15.820 --> 2:34:20.740\n And we're both drunk and whatever else is possible.\n\n2:34:20.740 --> 2:34:22.180\n So as it sloshed around,\n\n2:34:22.180 --> 2:34:23.020\n he claimed that was what,\n\n2:34:23.020 --> 2:34:23.940\n no, it has nothing to do with that.\n\n2:34:23.940 --> 2:34:26.420\n The moon, over there,\n\n2:34:26.420 --> 2:34:28.700\n the moon pulls differentially\n\n2:34:28.700 --> 2:34:30.660\n on the earth and the earth's ocean.\n\n2:34:30.660 --> 2:34:33.060\n That causes the oceans to bulge slightly\n\n2:34:33.060 --> 2:34:35.020\n towards and away from where the moon is.\n\n2:34:35.020 --> 2:34:37.420\n And the moon is actually the source of the earth's tides.\n\n2:34:37.420 --> 2:34:39.620\n It has nothing to do with Copernicus,\n\n2:34:39.620 --> 2:34:40.660\n the orbit of the sun.\n\n2:34:40.660 --> 2:34:42.420\n So he was totally wrong about that.\n\n2:34:42.420 --> 2:34:44.540\n He also thought that the Milky Way\n\n2:34:44.540 --> 2:34:46.180\n was comprised only of stars,\n\n2:34:46.180 --> 2:34:47.900\n when we know it's made of gas, dust,\n\n2:34:47.900 --> 2:34:49.740\n nebulae, and things like that.\n\n2:34:49.740 --> 2:34:51.220\n So he had his fair share of blunders.\n\n2:34:51.220 --> 2:34:53.620\n Now, one thing I always kind of make note of,\n\n2:34:53.620 --> 2:34:57.420\n and I'm actually producing along with Jim Gates,\n\n2:34:57.420 --> 2:35:00.460\n Fabiola Gianatti, Frank Wilczek,\n\n2:35:00.460 --> 2:35:02.420\n and Carlo Ravelli,\n\n2:35:02.420 --> 2:35:03.980\n and my friend Lucio Piccirillo,\n\n2:35:03.980 --> 2:35:07.220\n the first ever audio book of Galileo's dialogue,\n\n2:35:07.220 --> 2:35:08.980\n the one where he claimed to find evidence\n\n2:35:08.980 --> 2:35:11.140\n for the orbit of the earth around the sun,\n\n2:35:11.140 --> 2:35:12.580\n but it was an error.\n\n2:35:12.580 --> 2:35:14.700\n So you're reading parts of this text.\n\n2:35:14.700 --> 2:35:16.500\n Yeah, it's a brilliant book.\n\n2:35:16.500 --> 2:35:19.260\n So this book was written in 1632.\n\n2:35:19.260 --> 2:35:20.700\n It was written, and it was the one\n\n2:35:20.700 --> 2:35:22.340\n that caused him to go into house arrest\n\n2:35:22.340 --> 2:35:24.500\n and almost threatened to be tortured.\n\n2:35:24.500 --> 2:35:27.500\n And that book laid out his arguments\n\n2:35:27.500 --> 2:35:29.460\n for what was called the Copernican\n\n2:35:29.460 --> 2:35:33.860\n or the nonparapathetic Aristotelian, et cetera,\n\n2:35:33.860 --> 2:35:37.140\n notion of the planetary dynamic.\n\n2:35:37.140 --> 2:35:39.780\n And eventually he was forced to recant\n\n2:35:39.780 --> 2:35:40.700\n that he believed in it,\n\n2:35:40.700 --> 2:35:43.740\n and allegedly he said he still believes the earth moves.\n\n2:35:43.740 --> 2:35:44.900\n Anyway, so we're making,\n\n2:35:44.900 --> 2:35:46.300\n it's written in the form of a trilogue.\n\n2:35:46.300 --> 2:35:48.700\n It's actually called the dialogue with his three people.\n\n2:35:48.700 --> 2:35:50.380\n There's one named Salviati,\n\n2:35:50.380 --> 2:35:53.140\n who was espousing Galileo's notions\n\n2:35:53.140 --> 2:35:54.860\n about how the heavens were orchestrated.\n\n2:35:54.860 --> 2:35:58.220\n And Salviati means like the salvation, the savior.\n\n2:35:58.220 --> 2:35:59.980\n Then there's a middleman, Segredo.\n\n2:35:59.980 --> 2:36:04.140\n So Carlo Rovelli is playing Salviati, brilliant one.\n\n2:36:04.140 --> 2:36:05.540\n I am playing Segredo,\n\n2:36:05.540 --> 2:36:07.740\n who's like an intelligent interlocutor.\n\n2:36:07.740 --> 2:36:10.740\n I'm kind of just, I can appreciate Aristotle,\n\n2:36:10.740 --> 2:36:12.380\n I can appreciate Copernicus.\n\n2:36:12.380 --> 2:36:15.260\n Then there's this guy, Simplicio, the simpleton,\n\n2:36:15.260 --> 2:36:18.260\n and he espouses the words of the Pope.\n\n2:36:18.260 --> 2:36:19.620\n So you can imagine like,\n\n2:36:19.620 --> 2:36:21.700\n you're working in Putin's government\n\n2:36:21.700 --> 2:36:23.580\n or you're working in whatever,\n\n2:36:23.580 --> 2:36:27.020\n and all of a sudden you're kind of putting the words\n\n2:36:27.020 --> 2:36:29.820\n of like the fool, literally calling the fool,\n\n2:36:29.820 --> 2:36:30.780\n but you're using the words\n\n2:36:30.780 --> 2:36:33.860\n of the all supreme powerful being on earth at that time\n\n2:36:33.860 --> 2:36:35.300\n was the Vatican church,\n\n2:36:35.300 --> 2:36:37.300\n especially for an Italian like Galileo.\n\n2:36:37.300 --> 2:36:41.020\n So he wasn't as brilliant politically\n\n2:36:41.020 --> 2:36:44.180\n as he was astrophysically and otherwise.\n\n2:36:44.180 --> 2:36:46.580\n Who's doing Simplicio?\n\n2:36:46.580 --> 2:36:49.780\n Simplicio is a friend of mine in University of Manchester\n\n2:36:49.780 --> 2:36:51.540\n named Lucio Picciarello.\n\n2:36:51.540 --> 2:36:53.300\n He's an Irish guy, but he has an Italian,\n\n2:36:53.300 --> 2:36:55.420\n no, no, he's a full blooded Italian.\n\n2:36:55.420 --> 2:36:58.580\n They all speak English and Italian, I only speak,\n\n2:36:58.580 --> 2:37:00.420\n and the four words are written by,\n\n2:37:00.420 --> 2:37:03.660\n so one four word in this place has three four words,\n\n2:37:03.660 --> 2:37:04.940\n which is like a 12 word.\n\n2:37:06.700 --> 2:37:07.540\n Okay.\n\n2:37:07.540 --> 2:37:08.380\n The four words are written by.\n\n2:37:08.380 --> 2:37:09.220\n Can you explain that joke for me?\n\n2:37:09.220 --> 2:37:10.260\n Yeah, that was a good one.\n\n2:37:10.260 --> 2:37:12.580\n The four word, three four words.\n\n2:37:12.580 --> 2:37:14.540\n One of them is written by Albert Einstein\n\n2:37:14.540 --> 2:37:17.740\n in which he says Galileo was not only\n\n2:37:17.740 --> 2:37:19.220\n one of the greatest scientists in history,\n\n2:37:19.220 --> 2:37:21.740\n this is Einstein telling Galileo,\n\n2:37:21.740 --> 2:37:23.860\n but he was one of the greatest writers\n\n2:37:23.860 --> 2:37:26.420\n and minds of all of human history.\n\n2:37:26.420 --> 2:37:29.540\n That four word is read by Frank Wilczek, who you've had.\n\n2:37:30.580 --> 2:37:31.700\n Jim Gates, who you've also had,\n\n2:37:31.700 --> 2:37:35.100\n he reads the translation, the translator,\n\n2:37:35.100 --> 2:37:38.900\n Stillman Drake, who's a renowned scientific translator.\n\n2:37:38.900 --> 2:37:40.820\n And then Fabiola Giannati,\n\n2:37:40.820 --> 2:37:43.940\n she reads the introduction and dedication\n\n2:37:43.940 --> 2:37:46.780\n from Galileo to the Duke of Tuscany\n\n2:37:46.780 --> 2:37:49.380\n and some of the different introductions\n\n2:37:49.380 --> 2:37:50.620\n that Galileo himself had.\n\n2:37:50.620 --> 2:37:53.060\n It's just, it's such a thrill to be able to do it.\n\n2:37:53.060 --> 2:37:54.380\n I only randomly found out,\n\n2:37:54.380 --> 2:37:58.220\n cause I wanted to study it and it's like 500 pages long.\n\n2:37:58.220 --> 2:37:59.420\n And I was like, let me get the audio book\n\n2:37:59.420 --> 2:38:02.020\n cause I'm an audio medium kind of guy, didn't exist.\n\n2:38:02.020 --> 2:38:03.660\n So I said, let's do it ourselves.\n\n2:38:03.660 --> 2:38:05.420\n And so we did it and hopefully it'll be out\n\n2:38:05.420 --> 2:38:09.460\n on Galileo's birthday, which is February 15th, 2022.\n\n2:38:09.460 --> 2:38:11.580\n There'll be a ripe 457,\n\n2:38:11.580 --> 2:38:13.500\n but that's not the only one of his books.\n\n2:38:13.500 --> 2:38:14.780\n Galileo wrote many books,\n\n2:38:15.660 --> 2:38:18.020\n one of which is called the Military Compass.\n\n2:38:18.020 --> 2:38:20.620\n And this is an interesting book for my blockchain\n\n2:38:20.620 --> 2:38:22.620\n and your blockchain aficionados.\n\n2:38:22.620 --> 2:38:24.980\n In this book, he talks about a compass,\n\n2:38:24.980 --> 2:38:26.500\n which is not a magnetic compass,\n\n2:38:26.500 --> 2:38:27.940\n but an actual like slide roll.\n\n2:38:27.940 --> 2:38:29.500\n It's basically a slide roll.\n\n2:38:29.500 --> 2:38:31.500\n And it's a manual.\n\n2:38:31.500 --> 2:38:34.060\n It's like, imagine if your phone came with a manual,\n\n2:38:34.060 --> 2:38:35.100\n nowadays they don't, right?\n\n2:38:35.100 --> 2:38:38.140\n But this was a manual for how to use this slide roll,\n\n2:38:38.140 --> 2:38:39.820\n which is like enormously important.\n\n2:38:39.820 --> 2:38:41.900\n And he gives a whole bunch of worked examples.\n\n2:38:41.900 --> 2:38:43.140\n It's a brilliant book.\n\n2:38:43.140 --> 2:38:45.460\n One of the examples is how do you convert money?\n\n2:38:45.460 --> 2:38:47.540\n So he does a currency conversion\n\n2:38:47.540 --> 2:38:50.820\n between Ducati and Florentine Ducati\n\n2:38:50.820 --> 2:38:54.020\n and Scuti and whatever, you know, lira, whatever.\n\n2:38:54.020 --> 2:38:55.940\n He does all these currency conversions.\n\n2:38:55.940 --> 2:38:58.940\n One copy of this book, or maybe two exist,\n\n2:38:58.940 --> 2:39:02.220\n first printings from 1600 still exist.\n\n2:39:02.220 --> 2:39:06.100\n If Galileo had just kept those in his family,\n\n2:39:06.100 --> 2:39:08.740\n they're worth a hundred million dollars.\n\n2:39:08.740 --> 2:39:10.180\n Nowadays, you can't get a Scuti.\n\n2:39:10.180 --> 2:39:11.460\n A Scuti is worth nothing.\n\n2:39:11.460 --> 2:39:13.060\n Like a Ducati is worth nothing.\n\n2:39:13.060 --> 2:39:15.340\n I mean, maybe some collector wants a piece of paper, right?\n\n2:39:15.340 --> 2:39:16.180\n So it's a lesson.\n\n2:39:16.180 --> 2:39:18.780\n Like there are value in physical, you know,\n\n2:39:18.780 --> 2:39:22.500\n nonfungible tokens, this original nonfungible token.\n\n2:39:22.500 --> 2:39:24.500\n But then a third book is called the assayer.\n\n2:39:24.500 --> 2:39:26.420\n So what is an assayer?\n\n2:39:26.420 --> 2:39:29.020\n So assayers were kind of like these alchemists, you know,\n\n2:39:29.020 --> 2:39:33.020\n physicists, chemists that would be around a court.\n\n2:39:33.020 --> 2:39:35.300\n And every so often for the treasurer,\n\n2:39:35.300 --> 2:39:37.860\n they would want to accept pieces of gold from the citizens\n\n2:39:37.860 --> 2:39:40.780\n and convert that to script or, you know, paper money.\n\n2:39:40.780 --> 2:39:42.500\n And to do that, they needed someone\n\n2:39:42.500 --> 2:39:44.740\n to verify with a standard of gold\n\n2:39:44.740 --> 2:39:47.540\n that they knew to be gold and do some kind\n\n2:39:47.540 --> 2:39:49.740\n of semi non destructive evaluation\n\n2:39:49.740 --> 2:39:51.900\n of the purported object, the metal that\n\n2:39:51.900 --> 2:39:53.220\n was supposed to be gold.\n\n2:39:53.220 --> 2:39:56.420\n So they would take these pieces of gold, theoretically gold,\n\n2:39:56.420 --> 2:39:59.180\n and they would rub it on something called a touchstone.\n\n2:39:59.180 --> 2:40:01.820\n Touchstone was a special piece of rock, granite, whatever.\n\n2:40:01.820 --> 2:40:04.020\n It has no intrinsic value.\n\n2:40:04.020 --> 2:40:05.140\n It's just a piece of rock.\n\n2:40:05.140 --> 2:40:08.740\n But with that rock, you could assay and determine\n\n2:40:08.740 --> 2:40:11.420\n the content of this thing that could be worth, you know,\n\n2:40:11.420 --> 2:40:13.300\n millions of lira or whatever, right?\n\n2:40:13.300 --> 2:40:15.100\n So it was an incredibly important job.\n\n2:40:15.100 --> 2:40:18.780\n And so this person would take this piece of inanimate rock\n\n2:40:18.780 --> 2:40:20.740\n and use it to do something valuable.\n\n2:40:20.740 --> 2:40:22.780\n What I want to do in the Assayer Project\n\n2:40:22.780 --> 2:40:26.460\n is take this plethora of physical theories\n\n2:40:26.460 --> 2:40:27.020\n of everything.\n\n2:40:27.020 --> 2:40:29.660\n I said recently, you know, we should give a Nobel Prize\n\n2:40:29.660 --> 2:40:32.380\n to someone who doesn't come up with a theory of everything.\n\n2:40:32.380 --> 2:40:37.340\n Because there's just like, it's just rotten with them.\n\n2:40:37.340 --> 2:40:39.100\n And I think it's great.\n\n2:40:39.100 --> 2:40:42.980\n You know, I often say that theory is kind of like software.\n\n2:40:42.980 --> 2:40:44.740\n And I'm not denigrating software at all.\n\n2:40:44.740 --> 2:40:46.540\n But like, you can create a lot of software.\n\n2:40:46.540 --> 2:40:49.380\n You can make a quine, and it'll make its own quine.\n\n2:40:49.380 --> 2:40:51.300\n And you can make infinite amounts of software.\n\n2:40:51.300 --> 2:40:52.460\n Look it up, kids.\n\n2:40:52.460 --> 2:40:54.340\n That's one of my favorite videos.\n\n2:40:54.340 --> 2:40:55.260\n And you can replicate.\n\n2:40:55.260 --> 2:40:55.900\n You can't replicate.\n\n2:40:55.900 --> 2:40:57.780\n You can't make a telescope that makes a telescope that\n\n2:40:57.780 --> 2:40:58.540\n makes a telescope.\n\n2:40:58.540 --> 2:41:01.020\n In other words, hardware's kind of like the nonfungible token\n\n2:41:01.020 --> 2:41:03.460\n that's the ultimate minted, limited edition, the book,\n\n2:41:03.460 --> 2:41:05.420\n the compass book, like I talk.\n\n2:41:05.420 --> 2:41:07.420\n And so it's very expensive.\n\n2:41:07.420 --> 2:41:10.300\n That means you have to be very careful before you invest\n\n2:41:10.300 --> 2:41:14.140\n decades, billions, and humans into pursuing\n\n2:41:14.140 --> 2:41:15.700\n one of these theories of everything.\n\n2:41:15.700 --> 2:41:17.940\n You have to have good intuition for it.\n\n2:41:17.940 --> 2:41:21.180\n And lately, what I've seen is not predictions,\n\n2:41:21.180 --> 2:41:22.920\n but retrodictions.\n\n2:41:22.920 --> 2:41:25.580\n So you see that the Large Hadron Collider will come out\n\n2:41:25.580 --> 2:41:26.780\n with a measurement.\n\n2:41:26.780 --> 2:41:30.260\n And then so and so will say, oh, this\n\n2:41:30.260 --> 2:41:32.100\n is compatible with string theory.\n\n2:41:32.100 --> 2:41:35.460\n Or g minus 2 of the muon, it has these bizarre properties.\n\n2:41:35.460 --> 2:41:38.700\n Fifth force, string theory predicts this.\n\n2:41:38.700 --> 2:41:40.860\n String theory solves this.\n\n2:41:40.860 --> 2:41:46.020\n Neutrinos, sterile neutrinos, Large Hadron Collider bottom\n\n2:41:46.020 --> 2:41:47.820\n or B experiment, blah, blah, blah.\n\n2:41:47.820 --> 2:41:50.060\n They'll say that it's compatible after the fact.\n\n2:41:50.060 --> 2:41:51.300\n And it's not so bad, right?\n\n2:41:51.300 --> 2:41:54.980\n Because what did Einstein do with GR, general relativity?\n\n2:41:54.980 --> 2:41:58.180\n The first thing he did was not predict something new.\n\n2:41:58.180 --> 2:41:59.900\n He looked at the anomalous behavior\n\n2:41:59.900 --> 2:42:01.400\n of the planet Mercury.\n\n2:42:01.400 --> 2:42:03.480\n And he saw it was behaving strangely.\n\n2:42:03.480 --> 2:42:05.940\n And people had said, oh, that's because there's another planet\n\n2:42:05.940 --> 2:42:08.740\n hiding behind the sun that we can't see that perturbs\n\n2:42:08.740 --> 2:42:10.220\n the orbit of the planet Mercury.\n\n2:42:10.220 --> 2:42:12.020\n It's called Vulcan.\n\n2:42:12.020 --> 2:42:13.020\n That was one approach.\n\n2:42:13.020 --> 2:42:14.780\n That's kind of like the dark matter approach,\n\n2:42:14.780 --> 2:42:16.540\n where it's like there's a clump of matter\n\n2:42:16.540 --> 2:42:19.380\n that we can't see that's influencing the planet that we\n\n2:42:19.380 --> 2:42:20.300\n can't see.\n\n2:42:20.300 --> 2:42:22.820\n And we use that to divine and intuit the existence\n\n2:42:22.820 --> 2:42:23.700\n of the other planet.\n\n2:42:23.700 --> 2:42:25.520\n That's actually how Neptune was discovered.\n\n2:42:25.520 --> 2:42:27.900\n Neptune was discovered because of the anomalous behavior\n\n2:42:27.900 --> 2:42:29.180\n of the planet Uranus.\n\n2:42:29.180 --> 2:42:30.160\n So Neptune was dark.\n\n2:42:30.160 --> 2:42:30.980\n We couldn't see it.\n\n2:42:30.980 --> 2:42:33.100\n It was tugging on Uranus in a certain way.\n\n2:42:33.100 --> 2:42:36.060\n And that led to Le Verrier discovering the planet,\n\n2:42:36.060 --> 2:42:38.380\n predicting where this planet should be found.\n\n2:42:38.380 --> 2:42:40.540\n So it had a good heritage in physics\n\n2:42:40.540 --> 2:42:43.180\n to predict this planet that you couldn't see that worked.\n\n2:42:43.180 --> 2:42:45.300\n But Einstein said, no, it's caused\n\n2:42:45.300 --> 2:42:47.700\n by the warping and bending of spacetime\n\n2:42:47.700 --> 2:42:50.580\n due to the presence of matter, who will later become known\n\n2:42:50.580 --> 2:42:51.660\n as the Einstein equations.\n\n2:42:51.660 --> 2:42:54.380\n So he explained why Mercury did that.\n\n2:42:54.380 --> 2:42:55.980\n And it was known since the time of Newton\n\n2:42:55.980 --> 2:42:58.700\n that Mercury was behaving in this really freaky way.\n\n2:42:58.700 --> 2:42:59.660\n So he didn't predict it.\n\n2:42:59.660 --> 2:43:00.620\n He retradicted it.\n\n2:43:00.620 --> 2:43:01.500\n That's fine.\n\n2:43:01.500 --> 2:43:03.180\n But at some point, you should come up\n\n2:43:03.180 --> 2:43:05.140\n with something new that's uniquely\n\n2:43:05.140 --> 2:43:07.300\n predictive of your theory, as I just said.\n\n2:43:07.300 --> 2:43:09.960\n The theory of dark matter in the context of Neptune\n\n2:43:09.960 --> 2:43:11.060\n is actually a valid theory.\n\n2:43:11.060 --> 2:43:12.340\n It just happens not to make sense\n\n2:43:12.340 --> 2:43:14.620\n in the context of Vulcan.\n\n2:43:14.620 --> 2:43:17.860\n And so if he had kept doing that,\n\n2:43:17.860 --> 2:43:19.920\n maybe perhaps he wouldn't have come up\n\n2:43:19.920 --> 2:43:22.700\n with these other predictions that he would later reject.\n\n2:43:22.700 --> 2:43:24.980\n He rejected the existence of gravitational waves.\n\n2:43:24.980 --> 2:43:26.660\n You and Barry talked about that.\n\n2:43:26.660 --> 2:43:27.540\n He didn't actually believe it.\n\n2:43:27.540 --> 2:43:29.860\n It was the one peer reviewed paper that he had.\n\n2:43:29.860 --> 2:43:31.340\n He used to send back in those days.\n\n2:43:31.340 --> 2:43:33.580\n He'd send a letter to Nature, physical review,\n\n2:43:33.580 --> 2:43:36.900\n publish this, and know how much it cost.\n\n2:43:36.900 --> 2:43:37.860\n And he got it rejected,\n\n2:43:37.860 --> 2:43:40.260\n because he said you can't detect gravitational waves.\n\n2:43:40.260 --> 2:43:41.900\n And actually, or they're not real.\n\n2:43:41.900 --> 2:43:43.020\n And the guy showed that they're real,\n\n2:43:43.020 --> 2:43:45.020\n because he corrected a math error\n\n2:43:45.020 --> 2:43:47.220\n in Einstein and Rosen's paper.\n\n2:43:47.220 --> 2:43:48.060\n So it's fascinating.\n\n2:43:48.060 --> 2:43:49.940\n What should the assayer do?\n\n2:43:49.940 --> 2:43:52.460\n He or she should look at these theories,\n\n2:43:52.460 --> 2:43:54.660\n look what things they explain that already exist,\n\n2:43:54.660 --> 2:43:58.900\n and look at what new predictions they can claim to explain\n\n2:43:58.900 --> 2:44:01.940\n if we can build experiments to test them.\n\n2:44:01.940 --> 2:44:03.180\n So you have to kind of challenge yourself\n\n2:44:03.180 --> 2:44:06.140\n to think about what kind of predictions\n\n2:44:06.140 --> 2:44:09.500\n can they make such that we can construct experiments?\n\n2:44:09.500 --> 2:44:14.420\n So that's like ultimately back going to the signal,\n\n2:44:14.420 --> 2:44:19.220\n to the experimenter's theorist, essentially.\n\n2:44:19.220 --> 2:44:24.140\n So like very experiment centric exploration\n\n2:44:24.140 --> 2:44:25.980\n of the fundamental theory of everything.\n\n2:44:25.980 --> 2:44:26.820\n That's right.\n\n2:44:26.820 --> 2:44:29.060\n And the best scientists, the best physicists,\n\n2:44:29.060 --> 2:44:31.860\n were both experimentalists and theorists.\n\n2:44:31.860 --> 2:44:34.380\n Or at least if they were experimentalists,\n\n2:44:34.380 --> 2:44:37.460\n they understood the theory well enough to make predictions\n\n2:44:37.460 --> 2:44:38.620\n or to explore the predictions\n\n2:44:38.620 --> 2:44:40.940\n and the consequences of those predictions.\n\n2:44:40.940 --> 2:44:43.260\n Or if they were theorists, they were like Galileo.\n\n2:44:43.260 --> 2:44:46.060\n Like Einstein has patents for things that he invented.\n\n2:44:47.140 --> 2:44:50.260\n And then some of his work led to the laser and the maser.\n\n2:44:50.260 --> 2:44:52.940\n So he had practically, it wasn't just pure airy fairy,\n\n2:44:52.940 --> 2:44:55.300\n quantum reality and expanding universe.\n\n2:44:56.260 --> 2:44:58.580\n So in this case, what I wanna do is look at,\n\n2:44:58.580 --> 2:45:00.100\n there's 10 different theories of everything\n\n2:45:00.100 --> 2:45:01.580\n or cosmological models.\n\n2:45:01.580 --> 2:45:03.260\n They make predictions, they have advantages\n\n2:45:03.260 --> 2:45:05.620\n and disadvantages, and I'm just asking the question,\n\n2:45:05.620 --> 2:45:07.900\n why aren't we applying Bayesian reasoning\n\n2:45:07.900 --> 2:45:09.060\n with confidence intervals?\n\n2:45:09.060 --> 2:45:10.100\n Why don't we have updates?\n\n2:45:10.100 --> 2:45:12.020\n Every time an experiment comes out,\n\n2:45:12.020 --> 2:45:14.260\n we can update our credulity in that experiment\n\n2:45:14.260 --> 2:45:15.380\n or that theory rather,\n\n2:45:15.380 --> 2:45:17.260\n based on the results of the experiment.\n\n2:45:17.260 --> 2:45:18.980\n And we shouldn't do it after the fact,\n\n2:45:18.980 --> 2:45:20.980\n or as Michio Kaku has said,\n\n2:45:20.980 --> 2:45:23.980\n well, you have to tell me what the initial conditions are.\n\n2:45:23.980 --> 2:45:24.900\n And that's not my job.\n\n2:45:24.900 --> 2:45:26.820\n You're supposed to tell me if string theory is correct,\n\n2:45:26.820 --> 2:45:29.500\n what should it predict if it's true?\n\n2:45:29.500 --> 2:45:31.700\n There's one big problem, which I should say,\n\n2:45:31.700 --> 2:45:34.420\n that to be a good ass air,\n\n2:45:34.420 --> 2:45:39.420\n I think you have to be worldly in the sense of,\n\n2:45:40.420 --> 2:45:42.780\n worldly and curious, like we were talking about before\n\n2:45:42.780 --> 2:45:47.540\n with you and Joe, and you can't only talk your own book.\n\n2:45:47.540 --> 2:45:52.340\n You can't only understand your own pet theory of everything.\n\n2:45:52.340 --> 2:45:55.900\n You can't only say, well, I only understand string theory\n\n2:45:55.900 --> 2:45:58.500\n and I don't have time for these other theories,\n\n2:45:58.500 --> 2:46:02.820\n or as if it's beneath me to even go into Garrett Lisi\n\n2:46:02.820 --> 2:46:05.300\n or Eric Weinstein or Stephen Wolfram\n\n2:46:05.300 --> 2:46:08.100\n or aspects of M theory, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n2:46:08.100 --> 2:46:09.900\n And there are some that say,\n\n2:46:09.900 --> 2:46:14.900\n why do we give string theory so much of an advanced pass\n\n2:46:15.980 --> 2:46:18.380\n when there are actually predictions that's made\n\n2:46:18.380 --> 2:46:21.660\n that are completely anathema to what we observe in physics?\n\n2:46:21.660 --> 2:46:24.020\n Like the dark energy should be negative\n\n2:46:24.020 --> 2:46:25.500\n and we see it as positive.\n\n2:46:25.500 --> 2:46:26.540\n That's a huge strike.\n\n2:46:26.540 --> 2:46:28.940\n If you told somebody, here's my tenure application\n\n2:46:28.940 --> 2:46:30.380\n and what do you, oh, I've made this pretty,\n\n2:46:30.380 --> 2:46:33.860\n if it wasn't done by Maldacena and Whitten\n\n2:46:33.860 --> 2:46:34.820\n and folks like that,\n\n2:46:34.820 --> 2:46:36.980\n I don't know if it would have had the traction,\n\n2:46:36.980 --> 2:46:38.980\n the endurance, the resiliency that it's had.\n\n2:46:38.980 --> 2:46:42.820\n And that worries me because all these men and some women\n\n2:46:42.820 --> 2:46:46.180\n are making these fantastic, brilliant, beautiful ideas\n\n2:46:46.180 --> 2:46:48.580\n and they're not even looking at what their neighbor's doing.\n\n2:46:48.580 --> 2:46:52.020\n There's a thing that I really enjoyed seeing\n\n2:46:52.020 --> 2:46:54.620\n and that don't see often enough with these theories,\n\n2:46:54.620 --> 2:46:58.260\n which is others who are also experts\n\n2:46:58.260 --> 2:47:01.740\n kind of studying them sufficiently well\n\n2:47:01.740 --> 2:47:04.100\n to steel man the theory,\n\n2:47:04.100 --> 2:47:06.580\n to show the beautiful aspects of the theory.\n\n2:47:07.740 --> 2:47:09.900\n I see that with Stephen Wolfram.\n\n2:47:09.900 --> 2:47:14.900\n He has a very different sort of formulation of physics\n\n2:47:15.220 --> 2:47:17.180\n with his physics project.\n\n2:47:17.180 --> 2:47:21.420\n Now I'm, it's, physics is a foreign land to me,\n\n2:47:21.420 --> 2:47:24.820\n but his formulation, especially in the context\n\n2:47:24.820 --> 2:47:27.060\n of cellular automata or hypergraphs,\n\n2:47:27.060 --> 2:47:29.820\n just as objects, as mathematical objects themselves\n\n2:47:29.820 --> 2:47:30.780\n are familiar.\n\n2:47:30.780 --> 2:47:33.540\n And so I'm able to see the real beauty there\n\n2:47:33.540 --> 2:47:38.540\n and it saddens me that others in the physics community\n\n2:47:39.060 --> 2:47:41.220\n can't also see the beauty.\n\n2:47:41.220 --> 2:47:44.340\n Like give it a chance, give a chance to see the beauty.\n\n2:47:44.340 --> 2:47:45.180\n And that.\n\n2:47:45.180 --> 2:47:46.020\n Give it your respect.\n\n2:47:46.020 --> 2:47:48.700\n So there is one person who does take time\n\n2:47:48.700 --> 2:47:51.780\n and is what I consider to be a great scientist\n\n2:47:51.780 --> 2:47:53.220\n in terms of what he thinks.\n\n2:47:53.220 --> 2:47:55.820\n He obviously has invested interest in his own theory\n\n2:47:55.820 --> 2:47:57.100\n and it's Eric.\n\n2:47:57.100 --> 2:48:00.540\n Eric's got a truly encyclopedic knowledge\n\n2:48:00.540 --> 2:48:02.260\n of the history of physics.\n\n2:48:02.260 --> 2:48:06.260\n And he has a great warmth and graciousness\n\n2:48:06.260 --> 2:48:08.140\n when it comes to giving other,\n\n2:48:08.140 --> 2:48:09.900\n and I've witnessed this and I've had,\n\n2:48:09.900 --> 2:48:11.900\n look, first of all, I think debate is pointless.\n\n2:48:11.900 --> 2:48:14.460\n Like, I don't know about you, but if you've ever voted like,\n\n2:48:14.460 --> 2:48:15.940\n oh, I saw this debate and you know,\n\n2:48:15.940 --> 2:48:18.420\n because Trump did so badly, now I'm gonna vote for Biden.\n\n2:48:18.420 --> 2:48:19.380\n No, never have.\n\n2:48:19.380 --> 2:48:21.380\n You almost never change anybody's mind\n\n2:48:21.380 --> 2:48:23.100\n unless you debate with love.\n\n2:48:23.100 --> 2:48:26.780\n Unless you have almost like we're gonna win together,\n\n2:48:26.780 --> 2:48:28.900\n like the red team approach in the military,\n\n2:48:28.900 --> 2:48:30.380\n they're trying to win a war.\n\n2:48:30.380 --> 2:48:33.380\n So they may disagree on the tactics day to day,\n\n2:48:33.380 --> 2:48:35.180\n but the strategy, we have to win this war.\n\n2:48:35.180 --> 2:48:37.660\n I love you and I wanna protect you.\n\n2:48:37.660 --> 2:48:40.540\n I don't see that in very many of these physicists from Kaku.\n\n2:48:40.540 --> 2:48:42.820\n I almost see it, it's embarrassing in some ways\n\n2:48:42.820 --> 2:48:45.900\n because they'll almost mock with the exception of Eric.\n\n2:48:45.900 --> 2:48:47.180\n You know, Garrett's interesting.\n\n2:48:47.180 --> 2:48:48.460\n You know, his theory is, you know,\n\n2:48:48.460 --> 2:48:51.660\n people have a lot of issues, very technical,\n\n2:48:51.660 --> 2:48:54.700\n but Eric has taken the time to try to understand it.\n\n2:48:54.700 --> 2:48:57.420\n Eric has taken the time to understand Peter White's theory.\n\n2:48:57.420 --> 2:49:01.140\n And I don't see the same graciousness extended from them.\n\n2:49:01.140 --> 2:49:01.980\n I'm sorry to say.\n\n2:49:01.980 --> 2:49:03.260\n Yeah, essentially, you're right, you're right.\n\n2:49:03.260 --> 2:49:05.980\n I mean, with Eric, he hasn't, he wants to,\n\n2:49:05.980 --> 2:49:08.100\n but he hasn't extended the same for Stephen Wolfram\n\n2:49:08.100 --> 2:49:09.980\n because I think Wolf.\n\n2:49:09.980 --> 2:49:10.820\n No, he did.\n\n2:49:10.820 --> 2:49:11.660\n No, actually, no, he did.\n\n2:49:11.660 --> 2:49:13.580\n I had a debate with them live on my show.\n\n2:49:13.580 --> 2:49:14.740\n No, I did, I listened to it,\n\n2:49:14.740 --> 2:49:17.620\n but I just think it's outside of the toolkit\n\n2:49:17.620 --> 2:49:19.220\n that Eric is comfortable with.\n\n2:49:19.220 --> 2:49:21.140\n So it's not that he's not,\n\n2:49:21.140 --> 2:49:24.380\n but the main thing that's often absent\n\n2:49:24.380 --> 2:49:28.460\n and Eric does have is the willingness\n\n2:49:28.460 --> 2:49:32.380\n and not just dismissing or mocking that he's reaching out.\n\n2:49:32.380 --> 2:49:33.220\n But okay.\n\n2:49:33.220 --> 2:49:34.860\n I mean, what if it's not,\n\n2:49:34.860 --> 2:49:36.140\n you know, I made a joke when they were on,\n\n2:49:36.140 --> 2:49:38.380\n I was like, how many theories of everything can there be?\n\n2:49:38.380 --> 2:49:41.100\n You know, Highlander, there can be only one.\n\n2:49:41.100 --> 2:49:42.220\n I don't know, maybe.\n\n2:49:42.220 --> 2:49:44.580\n But he, of course, also, like the other folks\n\n2:49:44.580 --> 2:49:48.700\n who propose a theory, has an ego.\n\n2:49:48.700 --> 2:49:49.780\n Yeah.\n\n2:49:49.780 --> 2:49:54.780\n He rides a dragon with the dragon representing the ego.\n\n2:49:55.460 --> 2:49:59.140\n Well, let me ask you about your friend, Eric Weinstein.\n\n2:50:00.140 --> 2:50:03.540\n So he proposed initial sketches of geometric unity,\n\n2:50:03.540 --> 2:50:05.180\n which is his theory of everything.\n\n2:50:05.180 --> 2:50:07.820\n Maybe you can elucidate some aspect of it\n\n2:50:07.820 --> 2:50:08.980\n that you find interesting.\n\n2:50:08.980 --> 2:50:13.980\n But what do you think about the response\n\n2:50:13.980 --> 2:50:17.700\n he got from the scientific community?\n\n2:50:17.700 --> 2:50:19.380\n Well, you know, some of the response came\n\n2:50:19.380 --> 2:50:22.700\n from people, academicians, professors.\n\n2:50:22.700 --> 2:50:24.580\n Some came from a lay audience\n\n2:50:24.580 --> 2:50:26.780\n and some came from trained scientists\n\n2:50:26.780 --> 2:50:27.700\n who are no longer, you know,\n\n2:50:27.700 --> 2:50:29.540\n maybe practicing in the universities.\n\n2:50:30.500 --> 2:50:33.340\n I thought it was, there was a lot of vitriol,\n\n2:50:33.340 --> 2:50:38.180\n which surprised me because I look at what he's trying to do\n\n2:50:38.180 --> 2:50:41.500\n and it was always, the vitriol would always come\n\n2:50:41.500 --> 2:50:44.140\n with some element of ad hominem.\n\n2:50:44.140 --> 2:50:45.860\n And maybe that's his personality,\n\n2:50:45.860 --> 2:50:48.220\n maybe that engenders this or whatever.\n\n2:50:48.220 --> 2:50:50.860\n Maybe there is kind of just a natural tendency.\n\n2:50:50.860 --> 2:50:52.140\n You know, I always get these emails,\n\n2:50:52.140 --> 2:50:54.700\n Professor Keating, I have a new theory,\n\n2:50:54.700 --> 2:50:56.700\n Einstein was wrong, I'm gonna prove it.\n\n2:50:56.700 --> 2:50:59.140\n I'm not good at math, but if you help me,\n\n2:50:59.140 --> 2:51:01.260\n I will share my Nobel Prize with you.\n\n2:51:01.260 --> 2:51:04.580\n And I'm like, oh, thanks, have you read my books?\n\n2:51:04.580 --> 2:51:07.500\n In other words, it's always taking down the dragon.\n\n2:51:07.500 --> 2:51:09.900\n It's always taking down the Kung Fu master, right?\n\n2:51:09.900 --> 2:51:11.580\n That you get the hit points from D&D.\n\n2:51:11.580 --> 2:51:13.020\n You get their hit points, you take their cards,\n\n2:51:13.020 --> 2:51:15.460\n you get their risk tokens from Kamchaka.\n\n2:51:15.460 --> 2:51:18.300\n And thinking about with Eric, it's like,\n\n2:51:18.300 --> 2:51:21.180\n because what he's doing is so aspirational,\n\n2:51:21.180 --> 2:51:22.940\n it is grandiose in a good sense.\n\n2:51:22.940 --> 2:51:25.060\n What he's trying to do is construct\n\n2:51:25.060 --> 2:51:26.900\n a geometric theory of everything\n\n2:51:26.900 --> 2:51:28.740\n that has aspects of supersymmetry\n\n2:51:28.740 --> 2:51:30.220\n and stuff embedded in it.\n\n2:51:30.220 --> 2:51:34.380\n He's trying to meld that, it has very unusual features\n\n2:51:34.380 --> 2:51:37.220\n and that it features not only multiple spatial dimensions,\n\n2:51:37.220 --> 2:51:38.780\n multiple time dimensions,\n\n2:51:38.780 --> 2:51:42.900\n it uses new mathematical objects that he's invented.\n\n2:51:42.900 --> 2:51:46.660\n And look, I had him on my show, I've talked with him.\n\n2:51:46.660 --> 2:51:49.340\n We've had consultations with other physicists\n\n2:51:49.340 --> 2:51:51.860\n where he'll come down and I have a visitor's office\n\n2:51:51.860 --> 2:51:53.500\n and he comes down to San Diego sometimes\n\n2:51:53.500 --> 2:51:54.860\n and spends time there.\n\n2:51:54.860 --> 2:51:58.420\n And we talk with eminent mathematicians and physicists.\n\n2:51:58.420 --> 2:52:02.620\n Eric's been out of the academic world for a long time.\n\n2:52:02.620 --> 2:52:04.420\n And there is, as I said before,\n\n2:52:04.420 --> 2:52:07.460\n an aspect of persuasion that must take place\n\n2:52:07.460 --> 2:52:08.900\n in order to get anything through.\n\n2:52:08.900 --> 2:52:12.820\n And I think there was a slight amount of good nature,\n\n2:52:12.820 --> 2:52:15.740\n not ignorance, naivete, but just the sense that\n\n2:52:15.740 --> 2:52:18.260\n if this is right, everyone will recognize it.\n\n2:52:18.260 --> 2:52:19.740\n If you build a better mousetrap,\n\n2:52:19.740 --> 2:52:21.660\n the world will beat a path to your door\n\n2:52:21.660 --> 2:52:22.740\n as the expression goes.\n\n2:52:22.740 --> 2:52:24.380\n That's completely untrue.\n\n2:52:24.380 --> 2:52:25.780\n That doesn't even happen with mousetraps.\n\n2:52:25.780 --> 2:52:27.740\n I mean, you know how many fricking mousetrap types there are?\n\n2:52:27.740 --> 2:52:30.020\n It's like, no, they don't beat a path to your door.\n\n2:52:30.020 --> 2:52:31.820\n You have to sell that fricking thing.\n\n2:52:31.820 --> 2:52:34.900\n You have to sell it like Steve Jobs or Elon.\n\n2:52:34.900 --> 2:52:37.620\n I have never, I've had one paper out of 200 papers\n\n2:52:37.620 --> 2:52:39.420\n I've published in peer reviewed journals.\n\n2:52:39.420 --> 2:52:41.540\n I've only had one, half a percent,\n\n2:52:41.540 --> 2:52:43.860\n published with no referees comments.\n\n2:52:43.860 --> 2:52:45.420\n In other words, published like dream.\n\n2:52:45.420 --> 2:52:47.700\n Submitted it, it happened to be in a prestigious journal.\n\n2:52:47.700 --> 2:52:49.460\n Thought I was pretty psyched about that.\n\n2:52:49.460 --> 2:52:51.260\n But you almost have to crave the response,\n\n2:52:51.260 --> 2:52:52.540\n getting it back from a journal.\n\n2:52:52.540 --> 2:52:54.220\n And I think he doesn't, first of all,\n\n2:52:54.220 --> 2:52:56.380\n he doesn't subscribe to the peer review process.\n\n2:52:56.380 --> 2:52:59.060\n He thinks that is anathema to the way science is,\n\n2:52:59.060 --> 2:53:02.500\n invest interest in public, in journals, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n2:53:02.500 --> 2:53:05.580\n I think you can have elements of peer review\n\n2:53:05.580 --> 2:53:08.060\n that are substantive and valuable.\n\n2:53:08.060 --> 2:53:10.100\n I think you have to learn from your critics.\n\n2:53:10.100 --> 2:53:12.060\n One of my conversations with John Mather,\n\n2:53:12.060 --> 2:53:14.980\n he talks about loving your critics in this book,\n\n2:53:14.980 --> 2:53:17.140\n but not being so open to their criticism\n\n2:53:17.140 --> 2:53:19.260\n that their criticism goes to your heart\n\n2:53:19.260 --> 2:53:21.860\n and not being so open to their compliments\n\n2:53:21.860 --> 2:53:24.020\n that their compliments go to your head.\n\n2:53:24.020 --> 2:53:26.900\n It's a very tough Scylla and Charybdis to walk.\n\n2:53:26.900 --> 2:53:29.060\n Well, there's something, I mean,\n\n2:53:29.060 --> 2:53:31.940\n I wanna be careful here because I'd like to talk to,\n\n2:53:31.940 --> 2:53:35.620\n talk to Eric about this directly,\n\n2:53:35.620 --> 2:53:39.580\n but I'll just, from a perspective of a friend,\n\n2:53:41.220 --> 2:53:46.220\n wanna ask about the drug of fame.\n\n2:53:48.540 --> 2:53:51.540\n So there's also the public perception\n\n2:53:54.740 --> 2:53:56.580\n of the battles of physics.\n\n2:53:56.580 --> 2:53:58.760\n And so there's a very narrow community,\n\n2:53:58.760 --> 2:54:01.900\n but then there's the way that's perceived.\n\n2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:06.240\n The exploration of ideas is perceived by the public.\n\n2:54:06.240 --> 2:54:10.800\n And so there is a certain drug to the excitement\n\n2:54:10.800 --> 2:54:14.000\n that the public can show when they sense\n\n2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:15.600\n that you have something big.\n\n2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:21.200\n And that in itself might become the thing\n\n2:54:21.200 --> 2:54:23.680\n that gives you pleasure.\n\n2:54:23.680 --> 2:54:27.880\n And I think that with theories of everything\n\n2:54:27.880 --> 2:54:30.640\n or with any kind of super, super ambitious projects,\n\n2:54:30.640 --> 2:54:34.640\n and this is taking us back to when you were ambitious\n\n2:54:34.640 --> 2:54:37.760\n about trying to understand the origins of the universe,\n\n2:54:37.760 --> 2:54:41.400\n if you convince yourself that you have an intuition\n\n2:54:41.400 --> 2:54:43.800\n about the origins of the universe\n\n2:54:43.800 --> 2:54:47.440\n and you have a platform like you do now\n\n2:54:47.440 --> 2:54:50.840\n where you start to communicate your intuition,\n\n2:54:50.840 --> 2:54:54.440\n it's hazy, like all the science, you're still unsure,\n\n2:54:54.440 --> 2:54:56.920\n but you have a sense, I mean, perhaps you don't have that\n\n2:54:56.920 --> 2:54:58.520\n as much as an experimentalist\n\n2:54:58.520 --> 2:55:00.360\n because you always kind of start going,\n\n2:55:00.360 --> 2:55:05.360\n okay, how can I build a device to see through the fog?\n\n2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:08.320\n But if you're more like a theoretician\n\n2:55:08.320 --> 2:55:11.120\n who kind of works in the realm of ideas,\n\n2:55:11.120 --> 2:55:13.100\n in the realm of intuitions,\n\n2:55:15.160 --> 2:55:16.800\n it is also a source of pleasure.\n\n2:55:16.800 --> 2:55:20.220\n You mentioned dopamine, a source of dopamine\n\n2:55:20.220 --> 2:55:22.640\n that you can communicate to others\n\n2:55:23.500 --> 2:55:25.960\n that you're really excited by the possibility\n\n2:55:25.960 --> 2:55:28.760\n of solving the deepest mysteries of the universe.\n\n2:55:29.680 --> 2:55:32.320\n So there's some aspect to which you want to be\n\n2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:36.880\n a Grigori Grisha Perlman and go into the hole\n\n2:55:36.880 --> 2:55:40.960\n and get the work done and shut the hell up about the,\n\n2:55:40.960 --> 2:55:45.320\n speaking about myself, about talking about the dream\n\n2:55:45.320 --> 2:55:48.720\n and planning and exploring how great it will be\n\n2:55:48.720 --> 2:55:51.680\n if my intuition turns out to be correct.\n\n2:55:51.680 --> 2:55:55.660\n If the sketches I have turn out to actually build\n\n2:55:55.660 --> 2:55:58.640\n the bridge that takes us to a whole new place,\n\n2:55:58.640 --> 2:56:02.640\n as a friend of Eric's or a friend of,\n\n2:56:03.840 --> 2:56:08.640\n or my friend, what kind of advice do you give?\n\n2:56:08.640 --> 2:56:10.040\n What is your role?\n\n2:56:10.040 --> 2:56:14.280\n Is it to be a supporter given that he has many critics\n\n2:56:14.280 --> 2:56:18.940\n or is it to be in private a critic?\n\n2:56:18.940 --> 2:56:20.300\n Like a lot of my friends will say,\n\n2:56:20.300 --> 2:56:22.920\n hey, shut the hell up, just get it done.\n\n2:56:22.920 --> 2:56:25.760\n Well, first of all, I wanna ask you a question I've asked him\n\n2:56:25.760 --> 2:56:29.720\n and then it comes from Animal Farm by George.\n\n2:56:29.720 --> 2:56:31.480\n Probably my favorite book, yeah.\n\n2:56:31.480 --> 2:56:32.960\n So you remember Benjamin the donkey?\n\n2:56:32.960 --> 2:56:33.800\n Yes.\n\n2:56:33.800 --> 2:56:35.160\n And he's talking to the pig.\n\n2:56:35.160 --> 2:56:37.240\n I forget the pig's name, you probably know.\n\n2:56:37.240 --> 2:56:38.060\n Anyway, the pig says to him,\n\n2:56:38.060 --> 2:56:41.280\n you've got this long, lustrous, beautiful tail.\n\n2:56:41.280 --> 2:56:42.120\n You're so lucky.\n\n2:56:42.120 --> 2:56:44.560\n I got the short, curly, little squiggly thing\n\n2:56:44.560 --> 2:56:46.400\n that does jack squat.\n\n2:56:46.400 --> 2:56:49.480\n Tell me, how does it feel to have such a lustrous tail?\n\n2:56:49.480 --> 2:56:52.080\n And Benjamin says, well, the good Lord,\n\n2:56:52.080 --> 2:56:56.260\n he gave me a tail to swat away the flies.\n\n2:56:56.260 --> 2:56:57.440\n But you know what?\n\n2:56:57.440 --> 2:57:01.480\n I'd rather not have the tail if I didn't have the flies.\n\n2:57:01.480 --> 2:57:05.800\n So I wanna ask you, as I've asked Eric, is it worth it?\n\n2:57:05.800 --> 2:57:08.760\n You know, you've got these beautiful tail,\n\n2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:09.940\n but there are flies.\n\n2:57:09.940 --> 2:57:11.240\n I'm not saying in a negative way.\n\n2:57:11.240 --> 2:57:14.480\n I'm just saying you get unwanted distractions,\n\n2:57:14.480 --> 2:57:17.000\n dopamine, you know, it's kind of the highlight,\n\n2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:18.880\n the spotlight effect.\n\n2:57:18.880 --> 2:57:21.000\n It's obviously allowing you to do things\n\n2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:22.460\n that you could never do alone.\n\n2:57:22.460 --> 2:57:24.880\n And I think, you know, first of all,\n\n2:57:24.880 --> 2:57:26.120\n I'd love to know how you answer that.\n\n2:57:26.120 --> 2:57:29.380\n Cause that's something I don't feel I can relate to myself.\n\n2:57:30.240 --> 2:57:33.560\n Well, this has to do with more like.\n\n2:57:33.560 --> 2:57:34.400\n Platform.\n\n2:57:34.400 --> 2:57:35.440\n Platform stuff.\n\n2:57:35.440 --> 2:57:36.840\n Yeah, scale.\n\n2:57:36.840 --> 2:57:41.840\n Oh, I, that has no, very little effect on me.\n\n2:57:42.440 --> 2:57:43.860\n I enjoy it.\n\n2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:46.600\n I enjoy meeting new people,\n\n2:57:46.600 --> 2:57:48.400\n but that has nothing to do with platform.\n\n2:57:48.400 --> 2:57:52.000\n Yeah, no, that has no effect on me.\n\n2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:57.000\n I'm one somebody that enjoys the act itself.\n\n2:57:57.080 --> 2:57:58.360\n So this conversation,\n\n2:57:58.360 --> 2:58:01.160\n the reason I'm doing this podcast with you today\n\n2:58:01.160 --> 2:58:03.800\n is because that allows me to trick you\n\n2:58:03.800 --> 2:58:05.680\n into talking to me for a prolonged period of time.\n\n2:58:05.680 --> 2:58:07.040\n I don't care about platform.\n\n2:58:07.040 --> 2:58:08.400\n I assume nobody listens.\n\n2:58:08.400 --> 2:58:09.920\n It really doesn't matter.\n\n2:58:09.920 --> 2:58:11.120\n Yeah, I forgot it, right?\n\n2:58:11.120 --> 2:58:13.480\n My whole test of it was a good podcast.\n\n2:58:13.480 --> 2:58:14.320\n How do you know?\n\n2:58:14.320 --> 2:58:16.000\n Like podcast has been around what, 12 years?\n\n2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:18.320\n How do we know as podcasters we're doing a good job?\n\n2:58:18.320 --> 2:58:19.160\n Like sometimes someone will say,\n\n2:58:19.160 --> 2:58:20.400\n that was the best interview I ever had,\n\n2:58:20.400 --> 2:58:22.600\n but that doesn't happen that often, at least for me.\n\n2:58:22.600 --> 2:58:26.600\n But if you realize that you forgot to put the SD card\n\n2:58:26.600 --> 2:58:29.360\n in that little guy and the Zoom didn't work,\n\n2:58:29.360 --> 2:58:30.440\n would you do it again?\n\n2:58:30.440 --> 2:58:32.200\n And I think if you say yes to that,\n\n2:58:32.200 --> 2:58:33.080\n that was a good podcast.\n\n2:58:33.080 --> 2:58:33.920\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:58:33.920 --> 2:58:35.040\n That's exactly it.\n\n2:58:35.040 --> 2:58:40.040\n So in that space, yeah, all of it is worth it.\n\n2:58:40.880 --> 2:58:45.880\n But the dream, I'm more referring\n\n2:58:46.360 --> 2:58:47.880\n to the psychological effects.\n\n2:58:47.880 --> 2:58:50.280\n Forget the platform, forget all of that.\n\n2:58:50.280 --> 2:58:52.640\n You know, maybe you shouldn't even brought up the platform\n\n2:58:52.640 --> 2:58:55.920\n because it really has to do even in your own private mind,\n\n2:58:55.920 --> 2:58:57.640\n which is what I'm struggling with.\n\n2:58:59.080 --> 2:59:04.080\n I enjoy the planning, the dreaming, the early stages\n\n2:59:07.200 --> 2:59:11.720\n so much that I often don't take projects to completion.\n\n2:59:11.720 --> 2:59:14.080\n This is a psychological effect\n\n2:59:14.080 --> 2:59:16.560\n that I'm sure basically everybody, every engineer,\n\n2:59:16.560 --> 2:59:18.800\n everybody that does anything goes through.\n\n2:59:18.800 --> 2:59:22.800\n I just, in this case particular, I think it also applies.\n\n2:59:22.800 --> 2:59:25.480\n And I wonder as a friend, what is the role?\n\n2:59:25.480 --> 2:59:27.520\n So yeah, I mean, that effect has been documented,\n\n2:59:27.520 --> 2:59:30.240\n everything from planning telescopes to dieting.\n\n2:59:30.240 --> 2:59:34.000\n So there's a tiny bit of dopamine that you get\n\n2:59:34.000 --> 2:59:36.000\n visualizing how you're gonna feel.\n\n2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:38.000\n You don't need to know this, but you don't deal,\n\n2:59:38.000 --> 2:59:39.320\n but losing five pounds.\n\n2:59:39.320 --> 2:59:40.920\n I say, oh, I'm gonna lose five pounds\n\n2:59:40.920 --> 2:59:43.320\n and I'm gonna be able to run a minute faster.\n\n2:59:43.320 --> 2:59:45.400\n So there's a part of me when I'm planning the diet\n\n2:59:45.400 --> 2:59:47.040\n and the meals and the exercise\n\n2:59:47.040 --> 2:59:49.160\n that I get a little bit of that thrill\n\n2:59:49.160 --> 2:59:51.240\n and that actually saps a little bit of my willpower\n\n2:59:51.240 --> 2:59:53.440\n to actually complete the task that will take me to that goal.\n\n2:59:53.440 --> 2:59:54.600\n So that's a documented effect.\n\n2:59:54.600 --> 2:59:57.840\n And that happens in project planning and project management.\n\n2:59:57.840 --> 3:00:00.520\n It's a very, very important thing to guard against\n\n3:00:00.520 --> 3:00:02.600\n as a manager of a big project.\n\n3:00:02.600 --> 3:00:05.680\n With Eric, it's interesting because with him,\n\n3:00:05.680 --> 3:00:08.760\n first of all, we relate extremely well\n\n3:00:08.760 --> 3:00:11.800\n on a friendship level and very close.\n\n3:00:11.800 --> 3:00:14.200\n He does remind me a lot of my father\n\n3:00:14.200 --> 3:00:17.280\n and I've told him that just as a mathematician,\n\n3:00:17.280 --> 3:00:21.560\n as a big thinker, in his case, as a father,\n\n3:00:21.560 --> 3:00:24.440\n the father kind of figure that I didn't have in a sense,\n\n3:00:24.440 --> 3:00:27.160\n but that he is a true lover of life.\n\n3:00:27.160 --> 3:00:28.800\n He knows he's got a huge platform.\n\n3:00:28.800 --> 3:00:31.440\n He knows he gets a lot of attention for what he does.\n\n3:00:32.360 --> 3:00:34.640\n And I jokingly say, well, it's one thing,\n\n3:00:34.640 --> 3:00:37.520\n like how do you know, Lex, that someone's an expert?\n\n3:00:37.520 --> 3:00:39.000\n Experts say.\n\n3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:41.360\n There's a good rule Ray Dalio writes about in principles.\n\n3:00:41.360 --> 3:00:43.280\n He says, an expert is someone who's done something\n\n3:00:43.280 --> 3:00:44.880\n three times successfully.\n\n3:00:44.880 --> 3:00:47.160\n Like you can do something correctly once,\n\n3:00:47.160 --> 3:00:48.440\n you could do something correctly.\n\n3:00:48.440 --> 3:00:51.160\n It's very hard to pull off like three projects,\n\n3:00:51.160 --> 3:00:53.880\n three telescopes, three whatever, right?\n\n3:00:53.880 --> 3:00:57.200\n So look for, it's arbitrary, it could be four,\n\n3:00:57.200 --> 3:00:58.440\n it could be two, right?\n\n3:00:58.440 --> 3:00:59.720\n But the point is, look at Eric.\n\n3:00:59.720 --> 3:01:01.440\n So how many things has he contributed to\n\n3:01:01.440 --> 3:01:05.800\n and made pretty substantive kind of paradigm shifts\n\n3:01:05.800 --> 3:01:06.760\n for different people?\n\n3:01:06.760 --> 3:01:09.120\n I would say he's been right many times.\n\n3:01:09.120 --> 3:01:11.360\n Does that mean he's infallible, that he's ineffable?\n\n3:01:11.360 --> 3:01:12.680\n No, of course not.\n\n3:01:12.680 --> 3:01:16.280\n For me, so what I'm saying is I get a little bit of the joy\n\n3:01:16.280 --> 3:01:20.400\n of kind of learning something purely as a scientist,\n\n3:01:20.400 --> 3:01:23.520\n something completely outside of what I do, mathematics,\n\n3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:28.520\n gauge theory, the kind of very advanced geometry topology\n\n3:01:30.200 --> 3:01:31.760\n that he's interested in.\n\n3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:35.400\n But every now and then, I will sneak in that I want,\n\n3:01:35.400 --> 3:01:36.840\n you know, I've told him, I'm gonna turn your son\n\n3:01:36.840 --> 3:01:38.400\n into an experimentalist despite you.\n\n3:01:38.400 --> 3:01:40.200\n You know, like he is not gonna be a theorist,\n\n3:01:40.200 --> 3:01:41.240\n Zev is not gonna be a theorist.\n\n3:01:41.240 --> 3:01:43.400\n He is working with me, he is learning from me.\n\n3:01:43.400 --> 3:01:46.240\n We're trying to get him into, he wants to bypass\n\n3:01:46.240 --> 3:01:48.640\n all of the kind of nonsense of undergraduate\n\n3:01:48.640 --> 3:01:50.080\n and go straight to graduate school.\n\n3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:51.560\n And I've tried to encourage him\n\n3:01:51.560 --> 3:01:53.440\n that maybe he could do it, maybe he can't,\n\n3:01:53.440 --> 3:01:55.160\n but there's no other way than to try.\n\n3:01:55.160 --> 3:01:57.640\n And so I prepared a whole curriculum for Zev\n\n3:01:57.640 --> 3:01:59.600\n to basically bypass all of undergraduate.\n\n3:01:59.600 --> 3:02:02.000\n And to his credit, he's not earns all the credit.\n\n3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:03.360\n He's learned it to a level\n\n3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:05.080\n that matches many of my graduate students.\n\n3:02:05.080 --> 3:02:06.000\n Okay, hold on a second.\n\n3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:08.480\n I have to push back and this is me saying it\n\n3:02:08.480 --> 3:02:11.600\n and I'm sure I'll talk to Eric about this.\n\n3:02:11.600 --> 3:02:15.600\n But to say, you said Eric's done,\n\n3:02:15.600 --> 3:02:19.240\n was right on multiple things.\n\n3:02:19.240 --> 3:02:24.240\n I think Eric has a great deep insight\n\n3:02:24.640 --> 3:02:27.640\n about human nature and how societies work.\n\n3:02:27.640 --> 3:02:31.480\n And he says a lot of wise words on that world.\n\n3:02:31.480 --> 3:02:34.760\n But I think if we're talking about experts,\n\n3:02:34.760 --> 3:02:36.200\n you kind of have to prove, you know,\n\n3:02:36.200 --> 3:02:38.520\n it's like Michael Jordan playing baseball.\n\n3:02:38.520 --> 3:02:42.120\n Like he's proved it many times that he can play basketball,\n\n3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:44.480\n but he's also got to prove that he can play baseball.\n\n3:02:44.480 --> 3:02:47.480\n And I would say the whole point of, I mean,\n\n3:02:47.480 --> 3:02:51.960\n of radical ideas is you're not, I mean,\n\n3:02:51.960 --> 3:02:55.120\n it's very hard to be sitting on a track record of,\n\n3:02:55.120 --> 3:02:57.320\n I mean, when you're swinging for the fences,\n\n3:02:57.320 --> 3:03:00.840\n always there's not a track record to sit on.\n\n3:03:02.040 --> 3:03:05.240\n And like Max Tegmark is an example of somebody\n\n3:03:05.240 --> 3:03:09.320\n who has a huge track record of more like acceptable stuff,\n\n3:03:09.320 --> 3:03:11.520\n but he also keeps swinging for the fences\n\n3:03:11.520 --> 3:03:12.960\n in every other world.\n\n3:03:12.960 --> 3:03:14.800\n So he has that track record.\n\n3:03:14.800 --> 3:03:17.680\n With Eric, if you look at just the number of publications,\n\n3:03:17.680 --> 3:03:21.480\n all this stuff, he chose not to travel the academic route.\n\n3:03:21.480 --> 3:03:24.600\n So there's no proof of expertise\n\n3:03:24.600 --> 3:03:29.600\n except sort of an obvious linguistic demonstration\n\n3:03:30.040 --> 3:03:32.880\n of brilliance, but that's not how physics works, right?\n\n3:03:32.880 --> 3:03:35.320\n There's a polite way to damn somebody as a scientist\n\n3:03:35.320 --> 3:03:37.800\n and say he or she, they really know\n\n3:03:37.800 --> 3:03:40.080\n the history of physics very well.\n\n3:03:40.080 --> 3:03:41.240\n Like physicists always love it.\n\n3:03:41.240 --> 3:03:43.280\n Like Sean Carroll always jokes about like,\n\n3:03:43.280 --> 3:03:46.480\n physicists should never talk about history of physics,\n\n3:03:46.480 --> 3:03:47.560\n but it's more than that.\n\n3:03:47.560 --> 3:03:52.560\n So Eric has certainly contributed in finance specifically\n\n3:03:53.440 --> 3:03:57.400\n and gauge theory and economics and inflation dynamics\n\n3:03:57.400 --> 3:03:59.040\n and the non cosmological.\n\n3:03:59.040 --> 3:04:00.960\n Hold on a second, that's yet to be proven.\n\n3:04:00.960 --> 3:04:03.440\n He has a lot of powerful interests.\n\n3:04:03.440 --> 3:04:04.920\n Calculate is calculus proven.\n\n3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:09.920\n I mean, he has a gauge model for currency exchanges\n\n3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:13.480\n between different nations that is explanatory.\n\n3:04:13.480 --> 3:04:16.840\n Not, it's not, you know, is this something,\n\n3:04:16.840 --> 3:04:18.320\n in other words, it's a model\n\n3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:20.080\n and it's used for pedagogical purposes.\n\n3:04:20.080 --> 3:04:21.760\n And it might be, okay.\n\n3:04:21.760 --> 3:04:22.600\n It's unique to him.\n\n3:04:22.600 --> 3:04:23.800\n I mean, to him and Pia.\n\n3:04:23.800 --> 3:04:27.480\n Yes, it might be a powerful model.\n\n3:04:27.480 --> 3:04:29.560\n It might be one that's actually deserves\n\n3:04:29.560 --> 3:04:32.360\n a huge amount of applause and celebration,\n\n3:04:32.360 --> 3:04:34.120\n but does not yet receive that.\n\n3:04:34.120 --> 3:04:35.920\n And that's one of the things that Eric talks about.\n\n3:04:35.920 --> 3:04:38.000\n It has not received the attention it deserves,\n\n3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:40.920\n but it has not yet received the attention it deserves.\n\n3:04:40.920 --> 3:04:43.680\n And so like the proven expertise thing,\n\n3:04:43.680 --> 3:04:47.120\n I mean, there's a lot of people that go to their grave\n\n3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:50.400\n without the recognition they deserve and it's a tragedy.\n\n3:04:50.400 --> 3:04:53.760\n But the fact is like, you know,\n\n3:04:53.760 --> 3:04:55.680\n you have to fight for that recognition.\n\n3:04:55.680 --> 3:04:57.280\n The tragedy happens for a reason.\n\n3:04:57.280 --> 3:05:00.680\n You can't just say this person is obviously brilliant\n\n3:05:00.680 --> 3:05:03.360\n and therefore they deserve the credit\n\n3:05:05.240 --> 3:05:06.880\n in every single domain.\n\n3:05:06.880 --> 3:05:09.400\n It doesn't like transfer immediately.\n\n3:05:09.400 --> 3:05:12.000\n There's nobody that's, well, at least I wouldn't argue\n\n3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:15.520\n Eric is one of the special minds in our generation,\n\n3:05:15.520 --> 3:05:18.720\n but you still have to fight the fight of physics\n\n3:05:18.720 --> 3:05:20.440\n and prove it within the community.\n\n3:05:20.440 --> 3:05:22.720\n And I think the same applies in economics.\n\n3:05:22.720 --> 3:05:27.240\n You can't, I mean, as somebody that, you know,\n\n3:05:27.240 --> 3:05:30.760\n I've gone through the academic journey,\n\n3:05:30.760 --> 3:05:33.320\n just like you said, the peer review,\n\n3:05:33.320 --> 3:05:35.840\n all of those things, flawed as they are,\n\n3:05:35.840 --> 3:05:37.600\n that's the part of the process.\n\n3:05:37.600 --> 3:05:39.360\n You have to convince your peers,\n\n3:05:39.360 --> 3:05:44.120\n the people that are as obsessed for whatever the hell reason\n\n3:05:44.120 --> 3:05:46.720\n about that particular thing that you're working on.\n\n3:05:46.720 --> 3:05:48.040\n Yes, there's egos.\n\n3:05:48.040 --> 3:05:49.240\n Yes, there's politics.\n\n3:05:49.240 --> 3:05:50.880\n It's a giant mess.\n\n3:05:50.880 --> 3:05:52.840\n But I think it's a beautiful mess\n\n3:05:52.840 --> 3:05:56.160\n through which you have to go through\n\n3:05:56.160 --> 3:06:00.520\n in order to reveal the power of your idea\n\n3:06:00.520 --> 3:06:02.480\n to yourself and to the world.\n\n3:06:02.480 --> 3:06:03.360\n Well, let me use an example.\n\n3:06:03.360 --> 3:06:06.000\n So, you know of James Clerk Maxwell\n\n3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:08.520\n and he invented the laws of electromagnetism,\n\n3:06:08.520 --> 3:06:10.800\n which is the first example of a unification principle\n\n3:06:10.800 --> 3:06:13.480\n ever displayed by the human mind in history.\n\n3:06:13.480 --> 3:06:17.920\n Purely mathematics, unifying completely disparate phenomena.\n\n3:06:17.920 --> 3:06:20.320\n In one case, electricity, charges,\n\n3:06:20.320 --> 3:06:21.880\n static electricity, lightning,\n\n3:06:21.880 --> 3:06:24.680\n and the other magnets, bar magnets, currents, et cetera.\n\n3:06:24.680 --> 3:06:25.520\n Unify them.\n\n3:06:25.520 --> 3:06:27.400\n And you know what he did?\n\n3:06:27.400 --> 3:06:28.760\n I like to do a thought experiment.\n\n3:06:28.760 --> 3:06:31.040\n Imagine Twitter exists, 1864.\n\n3:06:31.040 --> 3:06:32.440\n Maxwell's working away.\n\n3:06:32.440 --> 3:06:34.000\n And he goes, I have this wonderful idea\n\n3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:37.760\n with fluxions and inductive virtue and blah, blah, blah.\n\n3:06:37.760 --> 3:06:39.960\n And it revolves on this thing called an ether.\n\n3:06:39.960 --> 3:06:42.800\n And by the way, there are these little vortices and gears\n\n3:06:42.800 --> 3:06:44.520\n and the gears have these planetary things\n\n3:06:44.520 --> 3:06:46.480\n and they suck up vortices and the vortices determine\n\n3:06:46.480 --> 3:06:49.040\n the density of the electromagnetic potential.\n\n3:06:49.040 --> 3:06:51.160\n You feel like this guy's a fricking moron.\n\n3:06:51.160 --> 3:06:52.520\n And what would you do?\n\n3:06:52.520 --> 3:06:53.840\n Come on, honestly, you would say\n\n3:06:53.840 --> 3:06:55.560\n everything this guy does is wrong.\n\n3:06:55.560 --> 3:06:57.280\n I mean, he's got this idiotic idea\n\n3:06:57.280 --> 3:07:00.080\n and it would be falsified a couple of decades later\n\n3:07:00.080 --> 3:07:02.040\n by Michelson and Morley.\n\n3:07:02.040 --> 3:07:04.520\n And in so doing, you would have thrown out\n\n3:07:04.520 --> 3:07:07.400\n a very beautiful baby with bathwater.\n\n3:07:07.400 --> 3:07:09.720\n Imagine Twitter, imagine the twit storm,\n\n3:07:09.720 --> 3:07:13.640\n clerk Maxwell, at clerk Maxwell one would get.\n\n3:07:13.640 --> 3:07:14.960\n It would be brutal, right?\n\n3:07:14.960 --> 3:07:16.040\n And to the detriment.\n\n3:07:16.040 --> 3:07:17.560\n And that might even set back history.\n\n3:07:17.560 --> 3:07:19.360\n Imagine Yang Mills doing the same thing.\n\n3:07:19.360 --> 3:07:20.560\n Chairman Simons.\n\n3:07:20.560 --> 3:07:22.200\n All these things are very fantastic.\n\n3:07:22.200 --> 3:07:23.240\n But why Lex?\n\n3:07:23.240 --> 3:07:26.680\n Why does Ed Witten, why does Juan Maldacena?\n\n3:07:26.680 --> 3:07:28.000\n Let me give a good example.\n\n3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:29.840\n Juan, brilliant guy, I love him.\n\n3:07:30.720 --> 3:07:33.520\n He is the reason that Stephen Hawking conceded\n\n3:07:33.520 --> 3:07:36.400\n his black hole information paradox loss issue.\n\n3:07:36.400 --> 3:07:40.280\n What did he concede based upon Maldacena's calculation\n\n3:07:40.280 --> 3:07:43.880\n in ADS, CFT and five dimensional wormholes?\n\n3:07:44.920 --> 3:07:45.760\n Is any of that?\n\n3:07:45.760 --> 3:07:47.440\n First of all, we don't live in ADS universe.\n\n3:07:47.440 --> 3:07:49.960\n Second of all, we don't know if wormholes are traversable,\n\n3:07:49.960 --> 3:07:51.840\n if they exist even.\n\n3:07:51.840 --> 3:07:55.440\n These are devices, Kip Thorne is popularized for movies.\n\n3:07:55.440 --> 3:07:58.320\n To say that this is something on which I will concede a bet.\n\n3:07:58.320 --> 3:08:00.840\n Now, obviously Hawking was doing that for publicity.\n\n3:08:00.840 --> 3:08:02.440\n Why does Maldacena?\n\n3:08:02.440 --> 3:08:04.480\n And he's got a pretty high H index,\n\n3:08:04.480 --> 3:08:06.560\n pretty well respected guy at IAS.\n\n3:08:06.560 --> 3:08:08.240\n Love talking to him, brilliant guy.\n\n3:08:08.240 --> 3:08:12.200\n By the way, also had made use of Eric and Pia's work\n\n3:08:12.200 --> 3:08:14.840\n on gauge theory and economics originally.\n\n3:08:14.840 --> 3:08:16.560\n And one, I believe the breakthrough,\n\n3:08:16.560 --> 3:08:17.640\n I can't remember exactly what,\n\n3:08:17.640 --> 3:08:20.600\n but partially credit some of the work that he did,\n\n3:08:20.600 --> 3:08:24.000\n which appears there's a footnote to Pia Milani's thesis\n\n3:08:24.000 --> 3:08:26.360\n and some conversations with Eric, I think in it.\n\n3:08:26.360 --> 3:08:28.320\n Anyway, getting back to that,\n\n3:08:28.320 --> 3:08:30.320\n why is there not the same skepticism?\n\n3:08:30.320 --> 3:08:32.040\n Is it because Maldacena,\n\n3:08:32.040 --> 3:08:34.160\n who's an eminent physicist obviously,\n\n3:08:34.160 --> 3:08:37.360\n has published realistic work and done,\n\n3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:39.040\n what about Witten?\n\n3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:40.000\n Witten gets a pass.\n\n3:08:40.000 --> 3:08:40.840\n I mean, if you, Witten just gets here.\n\n3:08:40.840 --> 3:08:42.840\n Well, Witten gets a pass on which aspect?\n\n3:08:42.840 --> 3:08:43.800\n The string theory?\n\n3:08:43.800 --> 3:08:45.200\n Yeah, that M theory is correct.\n\n3:08:45.200 --> 3:08:46.600\n I mean, here's, well, let me just say Hawking.\n\n3:08:46.600 --> 3:08:48.400\n Hawking gets the ultimate pass.\n\n3:08:48.400 --> 3:08:50.880\n Hawking would say things like M theory,\n\n3:08:50.880 --> 3:08:52.200\n there's zero evidence for it.\n\n3:08:52.200 --> 3:08:53.560\n I mean, there's the famous meme\n\n3:08:53.560 --> 3:08:54.880\n that went around this weekend, like,\n\n3:08:54.880 --> 3:08:56.200\n what is string theory predicted?\n\n3:08:56.200 --> 3:08:57.040\n And it's nothing.\n\n3:08:57.040 --> 3:08:57.920\n And by the way, that's actually wrong.\n\n3:08:57.920 --> 3:08:59.840\n I talked to Kamran, I know you talked to Kamran.\n\n3:08:59.840 --> 3:09:02.280\n Kamran says that string theory does make predictions.\n\n3:09:02.280 --> 3:09:03.840\n It predicts the mass of the electron lies\n\n3:09:03.840 --> 3:09:06.040\n between 10 to the minus one Planck mass\n\n3:09:06.040 --> 3:09:07.680\n and 10 to the minus 30 Planck mass.\n\n3:09:07.680 --> 3:09:09.680\n Okay, whatever, or electron.\n\n3:09:09.680 --> 3:09:10.520\n It's a big range.\n\n3:09:10.520 --> 3:09:11.720\n It's a huge range.\n\n3:09:11.720 --> 3:09:13.920\n Is that, imagine Kamran comes up and again,\n\n3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:16.560\n he's just some nobody, but he actually,\n\n3:09:16.560 --> 3:09:18.480\n he doesn't have a profile, he's not Harvard,\n\n3:09:18.480 --> 3:09:21.320\n has zero H and X or whatever Eric says.\n\n3:09:21.320 --> 3:09:23.000\n Why do we not like, in other words,\n\n3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:25.840\n why are we more harsh on people that are trying?\n\n3:09:25.840 --> 3:09:27.600\n You know the answer to that.\n\n3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:30.640\n So I get a million emails, just like you said,\n\n3:09:30.640 --> 3:09:34.240\n you yourself, where they provenized in my world\n\n3:09:34.240 --> 3:09:37.840\n as artificial intelligence, the equivalence of that,\n\n3:09:37.840 --> 3:09:40.400\n is I figured out how to build consciousness,\n\n3:09:40.400 --> 3:09:44.440\n how to engineer intelligence, how to, and sometimes.\n\n3:09:44.440 --> 3:09:45.840\n You should send your emails to me\n\n3:09:45.840 --> 3:09:46.680\n and I'll send my emails to you.\n\n3:09:46.680 --> 3:09:48.000\n And we'll reply to each other.\n\n3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:50.400\n I mean, and I don't want to sort of mock this\n\n3:09:50.400 --> 3:09:52.360\n because I think it's very possible\n\n3:09:52.360 --> 3:09:55.560\n that there is either kernels of interesting ideas\n\n3:09:55.560 --> 3:09:58.860\n or in whole, like there is geniuses out there\n\n3:09:58.860 --> 3:10:03.000\n that are unheard, but because there's so much noise,\n\n3:10:03.000 --> 3:10:08.000\n you do have to weigh out like a higher\n\n3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:12.120\n the Ed Wittons of the world when they make statements.\n\n3:10:12.120 --> 3:10:14.800\n And that's why you build up a track record.\n\n3:10:14.800 --> 3:10:16.860\n Like you just said with Ray Dalio,\n\n3:10:16.860 --> 3:10:21.860\n you have to show that you can, like if you're a Pollock\n\n3:10:23.080 --> 3:10:26.000\n and you show us a painting of a bunch of chaos,\n\n3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:28.480\n you have to, and this is a bad example, probably,\n\n3:10:28.480 --> 3:10:30.000\n because he probably never showed this proof.\n\n3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:30.840\n I don't think he could do it.\n\n3:10:30.840 --> 3:10:35.840\n Yeah, it's much more comforting to see\n\n3:10:36.600 --> 3:10:39.800\n that they can paint a good, accurate picture.\n\n3:10:39.800 --> 3:10:40.640\n Still life.\n\n3:10:40.640 --> 3:10:43.440\n Of still life, of an apple on the table.\n\n3:10:43.440 --> 3:10:46.320\n So there's, because then, I mean,\n\n3:10:47.960 --> 3:10:50.000\n because then there's something\n\n3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:51.360\n about the scientific community\n\n3:10:51.360 --> 3:10:54.820\n that they have perhaps an oversensitive bullshit sensor\n\n3:10:54.820 --> 3:10:57.200\n to where they're not going to give the full effort\n\n3:10:57.200 --> 3:11:00.200\n of their attention if you don't have the track record.\n\n3:11:00.200 --> 3:11:02.600\n Now you could say that's a kind of club\n\n3:11:02.600 --> 3:11:04.960\n that only you have to like, you have to have 10,\n\n3:11:04.960 --> 3:11:07.000\n you have to have this, yes, that exists,\n\n3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:10.440\n but there's some aspect in which you have to play the game\n\n3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:13.840\n a little bit to get the machine of science going.\n\n3:11:13.840 --> 3:11:16.560\n Otherwise, if you're always saying,\n\n3:11:16.560 --> 3:11:20.200\n well, I have my ball and I don't want to play your game,\n\n3:11:20.200 --> 3:11:23.480\n your game sucks, then nobody's gonna want to play with you.\n\n3:11:23.480 --> 3:11:24.720\n That's true.\n\n3:11:24.720 --> 3:11:28.080\n Look, inherent in all of this is an underlying grandiosity.\n\n3:11:28.080 --> 3:11:31.520\n Look, how could you talk about doing what Kaku said\n\n3:11:31.520 --> 3:11:33.520\n on here and elsewhere?\n\n3:11:33.520 --> 3:11:34.980\n We're looking for the umbilical cord\n\n3:11:34.980 --> 3:11:36.840\n that connects our universe to another universe\n\n3:11:36.840 --> 3:11:38.840\n that will then reveal in a one inch equation\n\n3:11:38.840 --> 3:11:41.440\n that will surely win a Nobel Prize, the mind of God.\n\n3:11:41.440 --> 3:11:42.960\n That's like a prerequisite, I guess,\n\n3:11:42.960 --> 3:11:44.160\n to tackle these questions.\n\n3:11:44.160 --> 3:11:46.960\n I think it's detrimental.\n\n3:11:46.960 --> 3:11:48.840\n I think doing that, first of all,\n\n3:11:48.840 --> 3:11:50.760\n I think there's an element of almost snarkiness\n\n3:11:50.760 --> 3:11:52.560\n because none of these scientists are believing,\n\n3:11:52.560 --> 3:11:55.720\n you know, Gnostics, they're not theists, right?\n\n3:11:55.720 --> 3:11:57.640\n So they're using it as kind of a stand in\n\n3:11:57.640 --> 3:11:59.200\n and always talk about Einstein didn't mean\n\n3:11:59.200 --> 3:12:02.080\n he was like a Spinoza and he wasn't a, you know, a theist.\n\n3:12:02.080 --> 3:12:03.040\n God doesn't play dice.\n\n3:12:03.040 --> 3:12:03.880\n God doesn't play dice.\n\n3:12:03.880 --> 3:12:05.200\n Yeah, Einstein's mentions of God, yeah.\n\n3:12:05.200 --> 3:12:07.520\n Yeah, and then Stephen Hawking says if,\n\n3:12:07.520 --> 3:12:09.660\n when we come, we get an M theory understood,\n\n3:12:09.660 --> 3:12:11.560\n we'll know the mind of God.\n\n3:12:11.560 --> 3:12:13.800\n That's the title of Kaku's book,\n\n3:12:13.800 --> 3:12:16.420\n The God Particle, The God Equation.\n\n3:12:16.420 --> 3:12:19.240\n It, you know, do any of them really believe in God?\n\n3:12:19.240 --> 3:12:20.340\n No, is that a prerequisite?\n\n3:12:20.340 --> 3:12:21.440\n No, I'm not saying that.\n\n3:12:21.440 --> 3:12:23.400\n But the point being,\n\n3:12:23.400 --> 3:12:24.900\n you're talking about something that has to do with God,\n\n3:12:24.900 --> 3:12:26.560\n right, I mean, where else do you go from there?\n\n3:12:26.560 --> 3:12:29.520\n I mean, I think God for now enjoys a little bit more,\n\n3:12:29.520 --> 3:12:33.160\n you know, kind of a PR than Elon or Joe or whatever, right?\n\n3:12:33.160 --> 3:12:36.040\n So like it's, you know, God's got a pretty good,\n\n3:12:36.040 --> 3:12:37.280\n you know, H index himself.\n\n3:12:37.280 --> 3:12:39.160\n He has a, by the way, a Twitter account,\n\n3:12:39.160 --> 3:12:40.440\n just so you know, it's pretty good.\n\n3:12:40.440 --> 3:12:41.360\n The tweets of God, yeah.\n\n3:12:41.360 --> 3:12:42.200\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n3:12:42.200 --> 3:12:43.320\n The tweet of God.\n\n3:12:43.320 --> 3:12:46.040\n So if you look at that, you have to go in there,\n\n3:12:46.040 --> 3:12:47.720\n again, you have to go in with some swagger.\n\n3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:50.360\n You have to have a little bit of arrogance,\n\n3:12:50.360 --> 3:12:51.520\n but you should, I agree,\n\n3:12:51.520 --> 3:12:52.800\n mix with a little bit of humility.\n\n3:12:52.800 --> 3:12:55.960\n So he's doing something, he comes from outside of academia.\n\n3:12:55.960 --> 3:12:58.240\n Now, if he rails against, I'm talking about Eric now,\n\n3:12:58.240 --> 3:12:59.700\n if he's just railing, oh, the system,\n\n3:12:59.700 --> 3:13:01.200\n and I'm not gonna publish because F that,\n\n3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:03.460\n and that's only created by greedy journalists,\n\n3:13:03.460 --> 3:13:05.640\n I don't think he's doing himself any favors.\n\n3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:08.120\n On the other hand, if he's shopping it, if he's talking it,\n\n3:13:08.120 --> 3:13:13.120\n if he's willing to expose it to criticism,\n\n3:13:13.240 --> 3:13:15.000\n and to even embrace people\n\n3:13:15.000 --> 3:13:18.120\n who may not have the purest intentions perhaps,\n\n3:13:18.120 --> 3:13:21.480\n but in the sense of like they're not arguing solely\n\n3:13:21.480 --> 3:13:23.920\n to get to the truth with a capital T,\n\n3:13:23.920 --> 3:13:25.680\n what they're trying to do is take down Eric.\n\n3:13:25.680 --> 3:13:27.700\n Hopefully those people aren't out there.\n\n3:13:27.700 --> 3:13:29.400\n But on the other hand,\n\n3:13:29.400 --> 3:13:32.280\n looking at what Eric does for other people,\n\n3:13:32.280 --> 3:13:34.600\n looking at the fact that he has courtesy,\n\n3:13:34.600 --> 3:13:36.640\n he will look at Wolfram, he will look at Lisey,\n\n3:13:36.640 --> 3:13:38.000\n who's one of his closest friends.\n\n3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:40.240\n I mean, he calls him as his aunt, not his aunt.\n\n3:13:40.240 --> 3:13:42.000\n Nemesis. Nemesis, right, right.\n\n3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:44.280\n I think that's interesting that they're loving friends.\n\n3:13:44.280 --> 3:13:46.160\n I really enjoyed that portal conversation\n\n3:13:46.160 --> 3:13:47.920\n between Gary and Lisey.\n\n3:13:47.920 --> 3:13:51.800\n Eric is torn about that conversation because, I guess,\n\n3:13:51.800 --> 3:13:55.260\n because of the nemesis of the beautiful dance of minds\n\n3:13:55.260 --> 3:13:56.920\n playing with these ideas and theories of everything.\n\n3:13:56.920 --> 3:13:59.120\n Some of these things, you know, look, so fundamentally,\n\n3:13:59.120 --> 3:14:02.080\n now I may disagree with him, Eric, on a different aspect,\n\n3:14:02.080 --> 3:14:03.440\n which is the only one I'm capable of,\n\n3:14:03.440 --> 3:14:04.500\n but let me say one thing,\n\n3:14:04.500 --> 3:14:06.720\n which is experimental, but let me say one thing.\n\n3:14:06.720 --> 3:14:08.820\n I understand probably a third\n\n3:14:08.820 --> 3:14:10.640\n of what Eric's talking about with GU.\n\n3:14:10.640 --> 3:14:13.900\n I understand, you know, GR, I understand mathematics,\n\n3:14:13.900 --> 3:14:16.440\n I understand some group theory, fiber bone,\n\n3:14:16.440 --> 3:14:19.120\n I can get a little of it, the age theory,\n\n3:14:19.120 --> 3:14:21.980\n but I also understand what I don't understand,\n\n3:14:21.980 --> 3:14:23.740\n and I understand that there are people like Witten,\n\n3:14:23.740 --> 3:14:28.200\n Maldacena, Nima, other people that can understand it,\n\n3:14:28.200 --> 3:14:29.840\n and they're not trying to understand it.\n\n3:14:29.840 --> 3:14:31.080\n Sabina, she can understand it.\n\n3:14:31.080 --> 3:14:32.500\n She makes all these, you know,\n\n3:14:32.500 --> 3:14:34.160\n oh, I don't understand it, I don't want to understand it.\n\n3:14:34.160 --> 3:14:36.480\n I don't have time, and then she makes a video,\n\n3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:39.080\n a music video, you know, kind of mocking Eric\n\n3:14:39.080 --> 3:14:40.600\n and Steven and Garrett, and I'm like,\n\n3:14:40.600 --> 3:14:42.400\n oh, you have a time to do, and I love Sabina,\n\n3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:44.480\n and I've actually promoted my show on her,\n\n3:14:44.480 --> 3:14:47.140\n and I love her, and she's doing a wonderful job,\n\n3:14:47.140 --> 3:14:49.880\n but you have a video that you said yourself\n\n3:14:49.880 --> 3:14:51.520\n takes eight weeks to produce from start to finish,\n\n3:14:51.520 --> 3:14:54.600\n and you couldn't have spent, you know, 30 minutes, two hours.\n\n3:14:54.600 --> 3:14:55.920\n I, Brian Keating, have done it\n\n3:14:55.920 --> 3:14:57.840\n as an experimental cosmologist,\n\n3:14:57.840 --> 3:15:00.280\n and I have enough to say, like, this is interesting.\n\n3:15:00.280 --> 3:15:02.880\n It's part of the ASEIR project, and it actually,\n\n3:15:02.880 --> 3:15:04.040\n I shouldn't say that there are no people.\n\n3:15:04.040 --> 3:15:04.880\n They're very serious.\n\n3:15:04.880 --> 3:15:08.160\n Louis Alvarez Gommet at SUNY Stony Brook\n\n3:15:08.160 --> 3:15:10.000\n at the Simon Center for Geometrical Physics.\n\n3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:12.280\n Yeah, so he and I are running this seminar,\n\n3:15:12.280 --> 3:15:13.120\n hopefully this summer.\n\n3:15:13.120 --> 3:15:14.480\n We're gonna reenact the famous\n\n3:15:14.480 --> 3:15:17.560\n Shelter Island conferences in the 1900s,\n\n3:15:17.560 --> 3:15:19.240\n where, you know, Feynman got together,\n\n3:15:19.240 --> 3:15:21.060\n and they calculated the Lamb shift and all that,\n\n3:15:21.060 --> 3:15:23.300\n but what did that feature?\n\n3:15:23.300 --> 3:15:25.680\n The harmony, the resonant minds\n\n3:15:25.680 --> 3:15:28.520\n behind the best experimentalists in cosmology,\n\n3:15:28.520 --> 3:15:30.580\n particle physics, condensed matter physics\n\n3:15:30.580 --> 3:15:32.920\n is now teaching us tremendous things about, you know,\n\n3:15:32.920 --> 3:15:35.840\n lower dimensional systems that can be applied.\n\n3:15:35.840 --> 3:15:37.800\n Theorists and experimentalists, observers,\n\n3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:40.640\n cosmologists, we all will get together,\n\n3:15:40.640 --> 3:15:43.360\n and we're just gonna do it out of a spirit of love,\n\n3:15:43.360 --> 3:15:46.080\n but if it's just like, oh, this guy's like a loudmouth,\n\n3:15:46.080 --> 3:15:46.920\n I don't have time for that.\n\n3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:47.760\n I really don't.\n\n3:15:47.760 --> 3:15:50.360\n I don't think it's interesting way to spend my time.\n\n3:15:50.360 --> 3:15:52.980\n There's a aspect that I hope to see,\n\n3:15:52.980 --> 3:15:56.440\n and it goes back to our sort of discussion\n\n3:15:56.440 --> 3:15:58.040\n about Joe Rogan.\n\n3:15:58.040 --> 3:16:00.500\n I do hope to see sort of love and humility\n\n3:16:00.500 --> 3:16:01.340\n in the presentation.\n\n3:16:01.340 --> 3:16:06.040\n Like, let go of this kind of fear of your ideas being stolen\n\n3:16:06.040 --> 3:16:09.500\n and the ego that's inherent to the scientific pursuit,\n\n3:16:09.500 --> 3:16:14.500\n and now that everybody is established and known entities,\n\n3:16:16.120 --> 3:16:17.360\n let go of that a little bit\n\n3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:20.180\n so we can explore and celebrate ideas.\n\n3:16:20.180 --> 3:16:21.360\n I would love to see more of that,\n\n3:16:21.360 --> 3:16:22.580\n just like, as you were saying,\n\n3:16:22.580 --> 3:16:26.120\n especially with these big ideas of theories of everything.\n\n3:16:26.120 --> 3:16:26.960\n And I've talked, I mean,\n\n3:16:26.960 --> 3:16:28.560\n this isn't talking tails out of school,\n\n3:16:28.560 --> 3:16:30.080\n but I mean, he has made claims\n\n3:16:30.080 --> 3:16:32.040\n that I fundamentally disagree with,\n\n3:16:32.040 --> 3:16:35.840\n in terms of like, he's had this Twitter baiting,\n\n3:16:35.840 --> 3:16:37.400\n loving trolling of Elon,\n\n3:16:37.400 --> 3:16:39.260\n why are you spending all this money to get to Mars?\n\n3:16:39.260 --> 3:16:41.140\n We should be spending money on interdimensional travel,\n\n3:16:41.140 --> 3:16:42.720\n and we can unlock it if we...\n\n3:16:42.720 --> 3:16:44.840\n And I said to him, and he makes the point\n\n3:16:44.840 --> 3:16:49.540\n that the atomic theory, that unleashed the nuclear age,\n\n3:16:49.540 --> 3:16:52.700\n and that could lead to planetary destruction.\n\n3:16:53.560 --> 3:16:56.140\n But I make the point pushing back with love on him,\n\n3:16:56.140 --> 3:16:58.760\n and I say, look, nobody looked into the equations,\n\n3:16:58.760 --> 3:17:01.280\n like Fermi didn't look into all these equations\n\n3:17:01.280 --> 3:17:04.000\n of the unification, which still doesn't exist, by the way.\n\n3:17:04.000 --> 3:17:05.320\n We spent all this time, Lex,\n\n3:17:05.320 --> 3:17:06.380\n and I don't know why it is,\n\n3:17:06.380 --> 3:17:08.520\n it's a phenomenon purely in theoretical physics.\n\n3:17:08.520 --> 3:17:10.920\n People are looking for the toe,\n\n3:17:10.920 --> 3:17:12.920\n and they're overlooking the gut.\n\n3:17:12.920 --> 3:17:13.760\n In other words, they're spending all this time\n\n3:17:13.760 --> 3:17:16.060\n on the theory of everything, the God equation,\n\n3:17:16.060 --> 3:17:18.720\n and there's this gut that unifies the three stronger forces.\n\n3:17:18.720 --> 3:17:20.280\n We don't have a single theory for that.\n\n3:17:20.280 --> 3:17:22.960\n And people like lash out, they've tried and failed at it.\n\n3:17:22.960 --> 3:17:23.920\n Yeah, for people who don't know,\n\n3:17:23.920 --> 3:17:27.340\n there's four forces, gut grant unification theories\n\n3:17:27.340 --> 3:17:29.460\n that unifies the three forces stuff,\n\n3:17:29.460 --> 3:17:30.880\n and I'm trying to get a shortcut\n\n3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:33.480\n to the theory of everything, which unifies the four.\n\n3:17:34.420 --> 3:17:35.820\n And then there's this whole thing\n\n3:17:35.820 --> 3:17:38.180\n that maybe quantum gravity is not even a thing.\n\n3:17:38.180 --> 3:17:43.180\n So we're trying to solve the puzzle of everything\n\n3:17:47.300 --> 3:17:49.000\n at the physics level.\n\n3:17:49.000 --> 3:17:51.540\n And then already before solving it,\n\n3:17:51.540 --> 3:17:53.240\n already saying, once we solve it,\n\n3:17:53.240 --> 3:17:55.080\n here's going to be all the beautiful time machines.\n\n3:17:55.080 --> 3:17:59.160\n We're just level jumping it, going to level 256.\n\n3:17:59.160 --> 3:18:00.900\n Time x and everything.\n\n3:18:00.900 --> 3:18:02.920\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n3:18:02.920 --> 3:18:06.780\n I suppose you need that kind of ego, that confidence,\n\n3:18:06.780 --> 3:18:09.400\n that ambition in order to even have a chance\n\n3:18:09.400 --> 3:18:10.240\n at some of these things.\n\n3:18:10.240 --> 3:18:13.160\n The only two people in this book of nine Nobel laureates\n\n3:18:13.160 --> 3:18:16.160\n who told me they don't have the imposter syndrome\n\n3:18:16.160 --> 3:18:19.520\n were two theorists, Frank Wilczek and Sheldon Glashow.\n\n3:18:19.520 --> 3:18:21.100\n And Frank is a pretty interesting,\n\n3:18:21.100 --> 3:18:22.240\n and I know eventually we're gonna talk\n\n3:18:22.240 --> 3:18:25.320\n about the meaning of life, but you talk about Frank.\n\n3:18:25.320 --> 3:18:27.740\n Frank invented this theory along with his advisor\n\n3:18:27.740 --> 3:18:32.040\n and another third person in the early 1970s,\n\n3:18:32.040 --> 3:18:34.680\n which from 1974, three, when he was at Princeton,\n\n3:18:34.680 --> 3:18:37.040\n all the way up until 2004, when he won the Nobel,\n\n3:18:37.040 --> 3:18:38.680\n every day of his life.\n\n3:18:38.680 --> 3:18:39.680\n Imagine this, Lex.\n\n3:18:39.680 --> 3:18:41.120\n You're gonna have this startup.\n\n3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:43.240\n Actually, someone tells you you're gonna win a lottery.\n\n3:18:43.240 --> 3:18:45.180\n You're gonna win a lottery in 40 years.\n\n3:18:45.180 --> 3:18:48.080\n What becomes your singular focus in your life\n\n3:18:48.080 --> 3:18:52.440\n from now until the next 40 years?\n\n3:18:52.440 --> 3:18:54.120\n Well, I'm not sure.\n\n3:18:54.120 --> 3:18:56.440\n I mean, would it be winning the lottery\n\n3:18:56.440 --> 3:18:57.280\n or if I'm so confident?\n\n3:18:57.280 --> 3:18:58.720\n No, I'm saying you're guaranteed to win a lottery.\n\n3:18:58.720 --> 3:18:59.560\n Yeah.\n\n3:18:59.560 --> 3:19:01.000\n Here's this wallet, Bitcoin wallet.\n\n3:19:01.000 --> 3:19:02.320\n It's gonna guarantee I have this much money.\n\n3:19:02.320 --> 3:19:04.160\n It's stable coin, whatever.\n\n3:19:04.160 --> 3:19:06.420\n You're gonna win it, but you have to wait 40 years.\n\n3:19:06.420 --> 3:19:09.180\n To me, it would be surviving for the next 40 years.\n\n3:19:09.180 --> 3:19:10.560\n You wouldn't leave your house.\n\n3:19:10.560 --> 3:19:12.540\n You would go out in a bubble wrap hat.\n\n3:19:12.540 --> 3:19:14.720\n You wouldn't go out with that 20 masks on, right?\n\n3:19:14.720 --> 3:19:17.160\n Your whole life would be consumed with.\n\n3:19:17.160 --> 3:19:18.400\n Now, imagine everyone's telling you\n\n3:19:18.400 --> 3:19:19.440\n you're gonna win the Nobel Prize,\n\n3:19:19.440 --> 3:19:20.800\n which is bigger than the lottery.\n\n3:19:20.800 --> 3:19:23.240\n I mean, many P prizes are worth more than the Nobel Prize\n\n3:19:23.240 --> 3:19:25.120\n and every person who wins a prize\n\n3:19:25.120 --> 3:19:27.280\n that's worth three times the money, like Maldacena,\n\n3:19:27.280 --> 3:19:29.280\n he would trade that breakthrough prize\n\n3:19:29.280 --> 3:19:30.720\n for a Nobel Prize and a heartbeat.\n\n3:19:30.720 --> 3:19:33.840\n So these guys had to wait 40 years.\n\n3:19:33.840 --> 3:19:35.540\n Imagine the excruciating pain.\n\n3:19:35.540 --> 3:19:36.560\n What got him through it?\n\n3:19:36.560 --> 3:19:38.480\n He didn't feel like he didn't deserve it.\n\n3:19:38.480 --> 3:19:40.520\n He felt like, hell yeah, I earned it.\n\n3:19:40.520 --> 3:19:42.440\n He has that swagger.\n\n3:19:42.440 --> 3:19:46.080\n And what I'm looking for in this asset is to try to find\n\n3:19:46.080 --> 3:19:47.560\n ways that we can test stuff now,\n\n3:19:47.560 --> 3:19:49.360\n cause I don't know if I'm gonna be here in 40 years,\n\n3:19:49.360 --> 3:19:51.880\n I hope I am, but can we bypass, can we get shortcuts?\n\n3:19:51.880 --> 3:19:53.600\n What's called the low energy regime.\n\n3:19:53.600 --> 3:19:55.680\n And to me, that's what's interesting.\n\n3:19:55.680 --> 3:19:56.720\n Like, what can we do now?\n\n3:19:56.720 --> 3:19:57.560\n I don't care.\n\n3:19:57.560 --> 3:19:59.640\n Like Isaac Newton came up with color theory\n\n3:19:59.640 --> 3:20:00.680\n and he did something really interesting.\n\n3:20:00.680 --> 3:20:02.280\n Next time I come, I'll bring you some prisms.\n\n3:20:02.280 --> 3:20:03.120\n What did he do?\n\n3:20:03.120 --> 3:20:04.040\n He took a white light.\n\n3:20:04.040 --> 3:20:06.040\n He took a prism from the sun, actually.\n\n3:20:06.040 --> 3:20:07.640\n He put it through a slit, put it through a prism\n\n3:20:07.640 --> 3:20:10.520\n and it made a beautiful rainbow, like you've seen.\n\n3:20:10.520 --> 3:20:12.320\n And then he took another prism\n\n3:20:12.320 --> 3:20:13.760\n and he put it upside down,\n\n3:20:13.760 --> 3:20:15.520\n like, you know, dark side of the moon, whatever.\n\n3:20:15.520 --> 3:20:17.240\n And the light went through the first prism,\n\n3:20:17.240 --> 3:20:18.080\n turned into a rainbow.\n\n3:20:18.080 --> 3:20:20.000\n And then the rainbow went into a prism\n\n3:20:20.000 --> 3:20:21.520\n and came out a white light.\n\n3:20:21.520 --> 3:20:22.760\n That's pretty cool.\n\n3:20:22.760 --> 3:20:24.760\n Then he took a popsicle stick or whatever,\n\n3:20:24.760 --> 3:20:26.400\n it's probably, you know, pipe tobacco.\n\n3:20:26.400 --> 3:20:29.720\n And he put it in the beam, like blocked out the orange\n\n3:20:29.720 --> 3:20:31.760\n and it didn't make white light come out.\n\n3:20:31.760 --> 3:20:34.120\n So he showed like colors of synthesis.\n\n3:20:34.120 --> 3:20:36.120\n It's a common, he didn't use like\n\n3:20:36.120 --> 3:20:38.120\n the Large Hadron Collider to do that.\n\n3:20:38.120 --> 3:20:40.200\n You know, he used a very low energy experiment\n\n3:20:40.200 --> 3:20:42.480\n to prove a unification in this color physics\n\n3:20:42.480 --> 3:20:43.720\n and different kind of color physics\n\n3:20:43.720 --> 3:20:45.400\n than in quantum chromodynamics.\n\n3:20:45.400 --> 3:20:47.840\n But nevertheless, can we find things like that?\n\n3:20:47.840 --> 3:20:49.800\n Are we spending way too much time and energy\n\n3:20:49.800 --> 3:20:52.200\n thinking about the future circular collider,\n\n3:20:52.200 --> 3:20:54.680\n which even if it gets built will cost $30 billion\n\n3:20:54.680 --> 3:20:55.520\n just to build.\n\n3:20:55.520 --> 3:20:56.720\n By the way, anytime from now on,\n\n3:20:56.720 --> 3:20:57.960\n if I leave you with anything,\n\n3:20:57.960 --> 3:21:00.160\n anytime an experimental physicist tells you a number,\n\n3:21:00.160 --> 3:21:01.960\n always double it, maybe triple it.\n\n3:21:01.960 --> 3:21:03.200\n How much is it gonna cost?\n\n3:21:03.200 --> 3:21:04.080\n To operate it.\n\n3:21:04.080 --> 3:21:06.240\n So like, do we build an aircraft carrier\n\n3:21:06.240 --> 3:21:07.680\n to build an aircraft carrier?\n\n3:21:07.680 --> 3:21:10.440\n Do we build a nuclear reactor, a semiconductor facility?\n\n3:21:10.440 --> 3:21:12.040\n And the rule of thumb that works pretty well\n\n3:21:12.040 --> 3:21:14.840\n in project management is it costs about 10% per year\n\n3:21:14.840 --> 3:21:18.160\n to operate a given object of sufficient complexity.\n\n3:21:18.160 --> 3:21:19.720\n And in this case, so in 10 years,\n\n3:21:19.720 --> 3:21:20.800\n it'll cost double the cost.\n\n3:21:20.800 --> 3:21:22.400\n So never believe a number,\n\n3:21:22.400 --> 3:21:24.800\n whether it's from our mutual friend, Harry or whoever,\n\n3:21:24.800 --> 3:21:26.160\n don't believe the number, double it.\n\n3:21:26.160 --> 3:21:27.480\n And then say, is it worth it?\n\n3:21:27.480 --> 3:21:30.440\n And so building a solar system size accelerator,\n\n3:21:30.440 --> 3:21:32.760\n even if it were possible, do we have to do that?\n\n3:21:32.760 --> 3:21:35.800\n Or can we use these two 30 solar mass objects\n\n3:21:35.800 --> 3:21:38.600\n colliding together to test the number\n\n3:21:38.600 --> 3:21:40.320\n of large extra spatial dimensions?\n\n3:21:40.320 --> 3:21:41.160\n Can we do that?\n\n3:21:41.160 --> 3:21:42.000\n People are working on it.\n\n3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:43.080\n I think it's fascinating.\n\n3:21:43.080 --> 3:21:46.120\n So focus on building detectors.\n\n3:21:46.120 --> 3:21:46.960\n Experiments.\n\n3:21:48.200 --> 3:21:53.200\n That like, where the cosmos is part of the experiment,\n\n3:21:55.480 --> 3:21:57.280\n I suppose, is doing the hard work.\n\n3:21:57.280 --> 3:22:00.200\n Cause when you're saying low energy regime,\n\n3:22:00.200 --> 3:22:02.560\n cause for some of these, especially big questions,\n\n3:22:02.560 --> 3:22:03.760\n like theories of everything,\n\n3:22:03.760 --> 3:22:07.320\n you need some high energy events.\n\n3:22:07.320 --> 3:22:10.240\n And so somehow figure out how the high energy events\n\n3:22:10.240 --> 3:22:12.640\n that are already happening out there,\n\n3:22:12.640 --> 3:22:16.040\n how to leverage them to understand here on earth.\n\n3:22:16.040 --> 3:22:19.040\n So one of the alternative theories of cosmology\n\n3:22:19.040 --> 3:22:22.000\n that is not a singular quantum gravitational requiring\n\n3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:23.840\n as the big bang and inflation are,\n\n3:22:23.840 --> 3:22:26.000\n is are these bouncing models.\n\n3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:29.000\n Some of them feature a similar kind of entity\n\n3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:30.560\n called the quantum field.\n\n3:22:30.560 --> 3:22:33.280\n And that quantum field in the initial stages\n\n3:22:33.280 --> 3:22:35.360\n of the universe of our current, after the bounce,\n\n3:22:35.360 --> 3:22:36.600\n which is not a singularity,\n\n3:22:36.600 --> 3:22:39.280\n it compresses to a classical kind of rebound\n\n3:22:39.280 --> 3:22:41.480\n and the universe starts expanding.\n\n3:22:41.480 --> 3:22:44.680\n During that process, the expansion is governed\n\n3:22:44.680 --> 3:22:46.360\n by what's called a scalar field,\n\n3:22:46.360 --> 3:22:48.200\n of which we only know one that exists,\n\n3:22:48.200 --> 3:22:49.160\n that's called the Higgs boson.\n\n3:22:49.160 --> 3:22:52.560\n Higgs is a scalar fundamental particle, fundamental field.\n\n3:22:53.440 --> 3:22:56.280\n That field then later does double duty\n\n3:22:56.280 --> 3:22:59.480\n and it becomes dark energy.\n\n3:22:59.480 --> 3:23:00.920\n So it solves two problems.\n\n3:23:00.920 --> 3:23:02.640\n And I'm not saying it's correct, we don't know yet.\n\n3:23:02.640 --> 3:23:04.560\n But are there observations of,\n\n3:23:04.560 --> 3:23:06.240\n and so dark energy is manifest today.\n\n3:23:06.240 --> 3:23:10.160\n It's manifest in properties we see in supernova explosions,\n\n3:23:10.160 --> 3:23:11.120\n et cetera, et cetera.\n\n3:23:11.120 --> 3:23:13.160\n We see the effects of accelerating universe\n\n3:23:13.160 --> 3:23:15.000\n caused by presumably dark energy.\n\n3:23:15.000 --> 3:23:18.160\n Is dark energy a constant or does it vary?\n\n3:23:18.160 --> 3:23:20.680\n That has to vary in order for this theory to be true,\n\n3:23:20.680 --> 3:23:22.280\n because that eventually has to decay\n\n3:23:22.280 --> 3:23:24.280\n so that the universe can not support itself\n\n3:23:24.280 --> 3:23:26.600\n and collapse again, again classically.\n\n3:23:26.600 --> 3:23:28.520\n So we could use low energy phenomenon.\n\n3:23:28.520 --> 3:23:29.720\n It's hard to think of supernova\n\n3:23:29.720 --> 3:23:31.360\n as being a low energy phenomenon,\n\n3:23:31.360 --> 3:23:34.080\n but we use that as a tracer of the cosmic expansion field\n\n3:23:34.080 --> 3:23:36.480\n and see, does it change or is it a constant?\n\n3:23:36.480 --> 3:23:38.040\n That's an example of a low energy limit\n\n3:23:38.040 --> 3:23:40.080\n to prove a high energy phenomenon,\n\n3:23:40.080 --> 3:23:43.000\n unlike this collapsing universe in the cyclic model.\n\n3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:46.480\n Speaking of things that cost a lot, but are super exciting.\n\n3:23:49.120 --> 3:23:51.320\n Page two, crap.\n\n3:23:51.320 --> 3:23:52.840\n No, we'll wrap it up.\n\n3:23:52.840 --> 3:23:53.680\n No.\n\n3:23:53.680 --> 3:23:56.520\n Calm down, this is, there's more than page two.\n\n3:23:56.520 --> 3:23:58.520\n What do you think this is?\n\n3:23:58.520 --> 3:23:59.360\n This is a...\n\n3:23:59.360 --> 3:24:00.200\n Thesis.\n\n3:24:00.200 --> 3:24:03.080\n Well, Louis de Broglie's thesis was three pages long\n\n3:24:03.080 --> 3:24:06.040\n and he won the Nobel Prize for the wave particle duality.\n\n3:24:06.040 --> 3:24:10.760\n So, size matters in different dimensions in life.\n\n3:24:10.760 --> 3:24:13.520\n I think the lessons I've learned about life\n\n3:24:13.520 --> 3:24:16.920\n is the short of the paper or the short of the thesis.\n\n3:24:17.920 --> 3:24:18.960\n Actually the short of the paper,\n\n3:24:18.960 --> 3:24:21.720\n some of the greatest papers ever written are short.\n\n3:24:21.720 --> 3:24:26.040\n I feel like some of the best ideas in this world,\n\n3:24:26.040 --> 3:24:28.720\n not to sound like a contradiction of Feynman,\n\n3:24:28.720 --> 3:24:30.440\n a contradiction on top of a contradiction,\n\n3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:32.720\n but it could be written on a napkin, honestly.\n\n3:24:32.720 --> 3:24:37.120\n It just kind of tells you something about ideas.\n\n3:24:39.480 --> 3:24:44.480\n What are your thoughts about the James Webb Space Telescope?\n\n3:24:45.480 --> 3:24:49.880\n Is this, as somebody who likes telescopes,\n\n3:24:49.880 --> 3:24:52.640\n and this is one of the, I think it says,\n\n3:24:53.840 --> 3:24:57.640\n took 20 years to build, $9.7 billion.\n\n3:24:57.640 --> 3:24:59.240\n Is that way too much, too little?\n\n3:24:59.240 --> 3:25:01.240\n Are you excited about this thing?\n\n3:25:01.240 --> 3:25:04.120\n It's sufficiently different from what I do in my field\n\n3:25:04.120 --> 3:25:05.920\n that it's incredibly interesting to me\n\n3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:09.560\n because I have no horse in that race.\n\n3:25:09.560 --> 3:25:12.320\n And so I'm not competing with them for time or money\n\n3:25:12.320 --> 3:25:14.320\n or resources or people or whatever.\n\n3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:16.680\n So I can purely be an advocate\n\n3:25:16.680 --> 3:25:18.920\n and an aficionado of science.\n\n3:25:18.920 --> 3:25:21.800\n It is in some sense the successor to Hubble.\n\n3:25:21.800 --> 3:25:24.600\n It will do things that Hubble can't do.\n\n3:25:24.600 --> 3:25:27.600\n It will also may or may not have the impact\n\n3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:31.440\n on a visceral kind of artistic level that Hubble had.\n\n3:25:31.440 --> 3:25:34.200\n What are some of the most iconic things that Hubble did?\n\n3:25:34.200 --> 3:25:37.720\n The Hubble Ultra Deep Field, the pillars of creation,\n\n3:25:37.720 --> 3:25:42.720\n storms and imaging of these twisted deep sky galaxies.\n\n3:25:42.920 --> 3:25:44.920\n Those resonated with the public.\n\n3:25:44.920 --> 3:25:46.920\n Just visually, they were beautiful.\n\n3:25:46.920 --> 3:25:48.920\n Yeah, when you look at these images,\n\n3:25:48.920 --> 3:25:50.240\n the Hubble Ultra Deep Field,\n\n3:25:50.240 --> 3:25:51.480\n you'll maybe put that in,\n\n3:25:51.480 --> 3:25:53.960\n you'll show every speck of light except for one,\n\n3:25:53.960 --> 3:25:55.920\n 4,000 blobs of light.\n\n3:25:55.920 --> 3:25:58.960\n There's one star in our galaxy, the rest are galaxies.\n\n3:25:58.960 --> 3:26:02.200\n Now that image is less than 1 10th of your fingernail\n\n3:26:02.200 --> 3:26:03.840\n held out at arm's length.\n\n3:26:03.840 --> 3:26:05.760\n It contains 4,000 galaxies.\n\n3:26:05.760 --> 3:26:07.080\n So now you can figure out\n\n3:26:07.080 --> 3:26:09.760\n how many galaxies there are in the whole sky\n\n3:26:09.760 --> 3:26:11.320\n just by seeing how long does it take you\n\n3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:13.120\n to move your fingernail over the whole sky.\n\n3:26:13.120 --> 3:26:15.200\n So we have another couple of hours.\n\n3:26:15.200 --> 3:26:16.280\n No, so it comes out to be,\n\n3:26:16.280 --> 3:26:18.880\n that's how we get 500 billion or more galaxies.\n\n3:26:18.880 --> 3:26:20.320\n Now it's not exact to the galaxy,\n\n3:26:20.320 --> 3:26:22.840\n but it's a good order of magnitude estimate,\n\n3:26:22.840 --> 3:26:24.480\n maybe even better.\n\n3:26:24.480 --> 3:26:26.920\n Hubble produced that and it was basically serendipitous.\n\n3:26:26.920 --> 3:26:29.160\n They pointed to some dark blank piece of sky\n\n3:26:29.160 --> 3:26:30.800\n what they thought was blank and they saw it.\n\n3:26:30.800 --> 3:26:32.560\n Same thing that happened with the CMB.\n\n3:26:32.560 --> 3:26:34.440\n They were looking for something they didn't find.\n\n3:26:34.440 --> 3:26:35.880\n Same thing they found when they were looking\n\n3:26:35.880 --> 3:26:38.280\n for the deceleration of the universe\n\n3:26:38.280 --> 3:26:40.280\n and found it was accelerating.\n\n3:26:40.280 --> 3:26:42.600\n So what I sometimes hear is that\n\n3:26:42.600 --> 3:26:44.400\n we don't know what we're gonna discover.\n\n3:26:44.400 --> 3:26:46.000\n I never think that's a good idea\n\n3:26:46.000 --> 3:26:47.760\n to spend billions of dollars on something.\n\n3:26:47.760 --> 3:26:51.120\n Like you should have some guaranteed low hanging fruit\n\n3:26:51.120 --> 3:26:53.360\n and then there should be swinging for the fences.\n\n3:26:53.360 --> 3:26:55.640\n And I think in this case, it was really everything\n\n3:26:55.640 --> 3:26:56.560\n is swinging for the fences\n\n3:26:56.560 --> 3:26:58.560\n because it's kind of a single point failure.\n\n3:26:58.560 --> 3:27:01.840\n If that telescope, which is this origami construction\n\n3:27:01.840 --> 3:27:05.400\n of 22 hexagonal panels that have to unfold properly\n\n3:27:05.400 --> 3:27:08.200\n and then orient themselves a million miles from Earth\n\n3:27:08.200 --> 3:27:11.000\n beyond the Earth moon distance by a factor of four\n\n3:27:11.000 --> 3:27:15.280\n and still transmit telecommunication back to the Earth,\n\n3:27:15.280 --> 3:27:17.680\n get solar energy, keep it away from the sun.\n\n3:27:17.680 --> 3:27:19.680\n You don't wanna look through the telescope of the sun\n\n3:27:19.680 --> 3:27:20.920\n with your remaining good eye.\n\n3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:22.760\n And you do that and you cover,\n\n3:27:22.760 --> 3:27:27.760\n it's gonna be phenomenal for science, for sure, if it works.\n\n3:27:27.960 --> 3:27:30.640\n There are a lot of people think it's so risky.\n\n3:27:30.640 --> 3:27:33.600\n NASA sunk so much of their budget, it ate up.\n\n3:27:33.600 --> 3:27:34.680\n And what if it does fail?\n\n3:27:34.680 --> 3:27:35.960\n I mean, there's no guarantee.\n\n3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:37.720\n Yes, it's insured, but so what?\n\n3:27:37.720 --> 3:27:40.000\n You're not gonna get back those 20 years of people.\n\n3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:41.200\n Well, let's start building it again.\n\n3:27:41.200 --> 3:27:43.440\n Like they didn't build two copies of it.\n\n3:27:43.440 --> 3:27:48.440\n And then if it fails, it kinda has a dampening effect\n\n3:27:49.240 --> 3:27:52.040\n on the prospects and the inspiration of the public\n\n3:27:52.040 --> 3:27:53.240\n for what science can do,\n\n3:27:53.240 --> 3:27:56.000\n what science engineering can do is out in space.\n\n3:27:56.000 --> 3:27:57.640\n It will make a huge impact scientific.\n\n3:27:57.640 --> 3:28:00.120\n Let's hope for the best, let's assume it does succeed.\n\n3:28:00.120 --> 3:28:01.680\n It's launched in a couple of weeks.\n\n3:28:01.680 --> 3:28:05.640\n And when it does, it will transform our understanding\n\n3:28:05.640 --> 3:28:10.080\n of we just discovered not only like extrasolar planets\n\n3:28:10.080 --> 3:28:12.120\n that have moons on them and asteroid belt,\n\n3:28:12.120 --> 3:28:15.120\n we discovered an extrasolar planet in another galaxy.\n\n3:28:15.120 --> 3:28:16.960\n This will be able to see crazy stuff like that,\n\n3:28:16.960 --> 3:28:21.320\n spectroscopy, imaging, but it will be able\n\n3:28:21.320 --> 3:28:22.960\n to go back farther in time,\n\n3:28:22.960 --> 3:28:25.080\n such that we will be doing cosmology.\n\n3:28:25.080 --> 3:28:27.480\n Hubble did some cosmology and measured the Hubble constant.\n\n3:28:27.480 --> 3:28:30.920\n That was its key project when it was designed and launched.\n\n3:28:30.920 --> 3:28:33.500\n But because it is optical telescope,\n\n3:28:33.500 --> 3:28:35.680\n it's sensitive to more close in redshift,\n\n3:28:35.680 --> 3:28:37.160\n so shorter distances.\n\n3:28:37.160 --> 3:28:39.360\n Now James Webb is much, much higher redshift.\n\n3:28:39.360 --> 3:28:42.320\n It can probe the darker, deeper, distant universe.\n\n3:28:42.320 --> 3:28:44.480\n Okay, let's talk about not the distant universe,\n\n3:28:44.480 --> 3:28:47.160\n but our neighboring planets.\n\n3:28:47.160 --> 3:28:52.160\n First, I gotta ask you about the moon.\n\n3:28:52.360 --> 3:28:55.120\n So there's a piece of the moon on this table\n\n3:28:55.120 --> 3:28:58.640\n that you've given me that we didn't have to pick up\n\n3:28:58.640 --> 3:29:00.200\n that arrived here.\n\n3:29:00.200 --> 3:29:01.040\n That's right.\n\n3:29:01.040 --> 3:29:03.360\n So how did a piece of the moon arrive here on Earth?\n\n3:29:03.360 --> 3:29:06.660\n So this chunk of the moon, if it were delivered\n\n3:29:06.660 --> 3:29:10.280\n by the Apollo and NASA missions,\n\n3:29:10.280 --> 3:29:12.800\n you and I would be guilty of a felony right now\n\n3:29:12.800 --> 3:29:14.580\n because it's illegal to own pieces of the moon\n\n3:29:14.580 --> 3:29:16.520\n collected by the Apollo astronauts.\n\n3:29:16.520 --> 3:29:19.640\n So don't even joke about that when you go over to Houston.\n\n3:29:19.640 --> 3:29:21.360\n This piece of moon rock was delivered\n\n3:29:21.360 --> 3:29:23.520\n via the old fashioned way by gravity.\n\n3:29:23.520 --> 3:29:27.620\n So this was a chunk of the moon, which is blasted off\n\n3:29:27.620 --> 3:29:31.840\n because the moon gets bombarded by asteroids and meteoroids.\n\n3:29:31.840 --> 3:29:34.760\n Some of them eject material from the surface of the moon\n\n3:29:34.760 --> 3:29:37.580\n into space, and it will then orbit\n\n3:29:37.580 --> 3:29:41.120\n the common moon Earth system.\n\n3:29:41.120 --> 3:29:44.020\n And it will then eventually enter our atmosphere.\n\n3:29:44.020 --> 3:29:45.560\n And if the piece is large enough\n\n3:29:45.560 --> 3:29:47.800\n and the trajectory is proper, it can land intact.\n\n3:29:47.800 --> 3:29:51.040\n And this one landed with a few hundred grams worth,\n\n3:29:51.040 --> 3:29:52.480\n and they sliced it up.\n\n3:29:52.480 --> 3:29:56.380\n And then it was delivered via US Postal Service to my house.\n\n3:29:56.380 --> 3:29:57.560\n So you can buy these pieces.\n\n3:29:57.560 --> 3:29:59.680\n And actually, you can buy a piece of Mars.\n\n3:29:59.680 --> 3:30:02.680\n You can buy a piece of Mars delivered by the same route.\n\n3:30:02.680 --> 3:30:04.360\n Now, what's so interesting about that?\n\n3:30:04.360 --> 3:30:06.560\n Well, if a piece of Mars can get here,\n\n3:30:06.560 --> 3:30:08.640\n a piece of Earth can get there.\n\n3:30:08.640 --> 3:30:11.440\n Some piece of Earth has some life forms on it.\n\n3:30:11.440 --> 3:30:12.680\n It could get there.\n\n3:30:12.680 --> 3:30:14.480\n And if that can happen in our solar system,\n\n3:30:14.480 --> 3:30:16.440\n it could happen throughout the galaxy.\n\n3:30:16.440 --> 3:30:18.400\n So I'm actually not of the opinion\n\n3:30:18.400 --> 3:30:21.360\n that there is life elsewhere in the universe,\n\n3:30:21.360 --> 3:30:23.560\n at least technological life that we can,\n\n3:30:23.560 --> 3:30:26.000\n I see this look of horror on your face.\n\n3:30:26.000 --> 3:30:30.120\n I view it, I am personally extremely pessimistic,\n\n3:30:30.120 --> 3:30:31.360\n would be extremely surprised.\n\n3:30:31.360 --> 3:30:34.480\n I'm just, I'm curious by the transition\n\n3:30:34.480 --> 3:30:39.240\n because you just said that life could have arrived from Mars\n\n3:30:39.240 --> 3:30:40.880\n or like from planet to planet\n\n3:30:40.880 --> 3:30:43.440\n because of the meteorites striking it and so on.\n\n3:30:43.440 --> 3:30:45.120\n And then you went to,\n\n3:30:45.120 --> 3:30:47.680\n you don't think there might be life out there\n\n3:30:47.680 --> 3:30:48.760\n in the universe.\n\n3:30:48.760 --> 3:30:49.800\n Technological life.\n\n3:30:49.800 --> 3:30:50.880\n Technological life.\n\n3:30:50.880 --> 3:30:53.640\n Yeah, advanced intelligence civilizations.\n\n3:30:53.640 --> 3:30:57.120\n Okay, so go on.\n\n3:30:57.120 --> 3:30:58.560\n So that's the generalization\n\n3:30:58.560 --> 3:31:01.120\n of what the famous astronomer Fred Hoyle called,\n\n3:31:01.120 --> 3:31:04.720\n I know this is a PG 13, it's called panspermia.\n\n3:31:04.720 --> 3:31:06.480\n Panspermia.\n\n3:31:06.480 --> 3:31:07.320\n Beep that out, please.\n\n3:31:07.320 --> 3:31:08.160\n Yeah, yeah, please.\n\n3:31:08.160 --> 3:31:12.520\n And that's the exchange of genetic life form material\n\n3:31:12.520 --> 3:31:14.360\n from other reaches on earth,\n\n3:31:14.360 --> 3:31:16.880\n which explains the origin of life on earth,\n\n3:31:16.880 --> 3:31:18.400\n but not the origin of life itself,\n\n3:31:18.400 --> 3:31:20.240\n which I think is a much grander mystery\n\n3:31:20.240 --> 3:31:22.120\n and much more interesting.\n\n3:31:22.120 --> 3:31:23.160\n How did life get here?\n\n3:31:23.160 --> 3:31:25.720\n And you've talked with many eminent people about that.\n\n3:31:25.720 --> 3:31:26.840\n I'm not gonna add that much,\n\n3:31:26.840 --> 3:31:29.560\n but just thinking about the reverse process.\n\n3:31:29.560 --> 3:31:32.720\n Let's say life started on the earth somehow\n\n3:31:32.720 --> 3:31:34.720\n and then made its way out into the universe.\n\n3:31:34.720 --> 3:31:36.120\n Is there enough time for the,\n\n3:31:36.120 --> 3:31:37.960\n whatever material went from earth\n\n3:31:37.960 --> 3:31:40.560\n via panspermic direction,\n\n3:31:40.560 --> 3:31:42.880\n spraying the love gun out into the universe,\n\n3:31:42.880 --> 3:31:45.200\n did that then have enough time to incubate\n\n3:31:45.200 --> 3:31:47.440\n and go onto a planet that could support it?\n\n3:31:47.440 --> 3:31:49.680\n Certainly not within our solar system,\n\n3:31:49.680 --> 3:31:51.400\n which traveling at the meteorite speeds\n\n3:31:51.400 --> 3:31:53.880\n would require hundreds of millions of years.\n\n3:31:53.880 --> 3:31:55.720\n Then looking at the evolutionary history\n\n3:31:55.720 --> 3:31:57.760\n from bacteria to Bach,\n\n3:31:57.760 --> 3:32:00.680\n from rocks to Rachmaninoff,\n\n3:32:00.680 --> 3:32:01.880\n I don't know, I can do this all day.\n\n3:32:01.880 --> 3:32:02.920\n Oh wow, that's pretty good.\n\n3:32:02.920 --> 3:32:05.080\n How do you get from those very simple\n\n3:32:05.080 --> 3:32:06.320\n inanimate objects to life?\n\n3:32:06.320 --> 3:32:07.800\n I just simply think there's not enough time\n\n3:32:07.800 --> 3:32:09.040\n for earth to seed life,\n\n3:32:09.040 --> 3:32:10.720\n technological life throughout the galaxy.\n\n3:32:10.720 --> 3:32:12.560\n I don't think there's any evidence for that.\n\n3:32:12.560 --> 3:32:15.680\n But so you really think that the origin\n\n3:32:15.680 --> 3:32:19.960\n of life on earth is a really special event?\n\n3:32:19.960 --> 3:32:22.760\n Yeah, if it did originate on earth,\n\n3:32:22.760 --> 3:32:24.800\n my question for those that search for life\n\n3:32:24.800 --> 3:32:28.440\n outside the earth is what if you had a letter from God\n\n3:32:28.440 --> 3:32:32.320\n and the letter said life didn't originate on earth,\n\n3:32:32.320 --> 3:32:34.920\n like would you choose a different profession?\n\n3:32:34.920 --> 3:32:36.440\n Like it would seem hopeless.\n\n3:32:36.440 --> 3:32:38.280\n Like in other words, we only have a sample of one.\n\n3:32:38.280 --> 3:32:40.320\n In fact, we only know of one conscious life form,\n\n3:32:40.320 --> 3:32:42.800\n let alone one planet that has life on it, right?\n\n3:32:42.800 --> 3:32:45.080\n What if you knew for sure it didn't start here?\n\n3:32:45.080 --> 3:32:48.080\n That means that like there's almost nothing about earth\n\n3:32:48.080 --> 3:32:52.240\n that is originated, it didn't originate the life process.\n\n3:32:52.240 --> 3:32:54.000\n So to study purely the origin of life,\n\n3:32:54.000 --> 3:32:55.960\n not life itself, I think that's still fascinating.\n\n3:32:55.960 --> 3:32:59.240\n But how could we learn about the origin of,\n\n3:32:59.240 --> 3:33:01.120\n remember you have to go from inanimate object\n\n3:33:01.120 --> 3:33:04.280\n to a living object, whatever that definition of life is.\n\n3:33:04.280 --> 3:33:06.360\n And I'm not an expert in many definitions,\n\n3:33:06.360 --> 3:33:09.520\n Max, Sarah, you know, many different definition.\n\n3:33:09.520 --> 3:33:13.800\n But how do you actually go from inanimate to animate?\n\n3:33:13.800 --> 3:33:14.840\n It's a huge question.\n\n3:33:14.840 --> 3:33:17.360\n Yeah, but then you don't have to be the place\n\n3:33:17.360 --> 3:33:20.400\n where life originated to replicate the origin\n\n3:33:20.400 --> 3:33:22.640\n or to under, like, yeah, that's one way\n\n3:33:22.640 --> 3:33:26.080\n to understand something is to build it.\n\n3:33:26.080 --> 3:33:27.760\n But another way is to just observe it.\n\n3:33:27.760 --> 3:33:32.040\n You don't have to truly re engineer from scratch.\n\n3:33:32.040 --> 3:33:37.040\n So, you know, but then yes, if it didn't originate on earth,\n\n3:33:37.240 --> 3:33:41.800\n then your intuitions about the basic prerequisites\n\n3:33:41.800 --> 3:33:43.640\n of life are off.\n\n3:33:43.640 --> 3:33:45.160\n What's the governing principle, right?\n\n3:33:45.160 --> 3:33:48.280\n Like, what is, and then you can have just\n\n3:33:48.280 --> 3:33:51.640\n almost an arbitrary number of possible,\n\n3:33:51.640 --> 3:33:54.520\n like, if life didn't start on earth.\n\n3:33:56.480 --> 3:33:59.080\n So to me, that's exciting because it's like,\n\n3:33:59.080 --> 3:34:02.160\n we know even less than we thought.\n\n3:34:02.160 --> 3:34:05.200\n The thing is it can prosper on earth though.\n\n3:34:05.200 --> 3:34:06.040\n Yeah.\n\n3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:08.920\n So maybe the origin of life is fundamentally different\n\n3:34:08.920 --> 3:34:11.240\n from the maintenance of life.\n\n3:34:11.240 --> 3:34:13.200\n Right, and maybe the existence\n\n3:34:13.200 --> 3:34:16.680\n of the earth life symbiosis is critical.\n\n3:34:16.680 --> 3:34:19.800\n I think Sarah, and you talked about Sarah Walker,\n\n3:34:19.800 --> 3:34:22.120\n that it's a planetary phenomenon, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n3:34:22.120 --> 3:34:24.240\n So doesn't that make it less like, in other words,\n\n3:34:24.240 --> 3:34:27.120\n like not only do you need special life conditions\n\n3:34:27.120 --> 3:34:31.560\n to create life, but then sustenance of life, as you say,\n\n3:34:31.560 --> 3:34:33.840\n that also has to be maintained\n\n3:34:33.840 --> 3:34:35.640\n under very specific circumstances\n\n3:34:35.640 --> 3:34:37.000\n by very specific planets\n\n3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:39.520\n and with very specific tectonic activity and moon.\n\n3:34:39.520 --> 3:34:41.480\n And by the way, you need a Jupiter nearby.\n\n3:34:41.480 --> 3:34:43.760\n You need an earth and a moon system\n\n3:34:43.760 --> 3:34:45.960\n so that you don't get bombarded too early.\n\n3:34:45.960 --> 3:34:48.720\n And I always think like this, like technological life,\n\n3:34:48.720 --> 3:34:50.600\n I haven't said this before, really, so I'm just speaking.\n\n3:34:50.600 --> 3:34:52.760\n I usually like to write down before I say these different,\n\n3:34:52.760 --> 3:34:53.840\n but one of the things I thought about is.\n\n3:34:53.840 --> 3:34:56.000\n Somebody hosts a podcast.\n\n3:34:56.000 --> 3:34:57.720\n You should probably accept the fact\n\n3:34:57.720 --> 3:34:59.320\n that you're going to say stupid things\n\n3:34:59.320 --> 3:35:00.200\n every once in a while.\n\n3:35:00.200 --> 3:35:02.880\n Not every once in a while, every while.\n\n3:35:02.880 --> 3:35:07.880\n I claim that to get to sending people to the moon,\n\n3:35:08.440 --> 3:35:12.000\n our planet needed whales and dinosaurs, right?\n\n3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:13.360\n Like you don't make a solar panel\n\n3:35:13.360 --> 3:35:14.880\n from another solar panel.\n\n3:35:14.880 --> 3:35:17.120\n Like you made a solar panel from a factory\n\n3:35:17.120 --> 3:35:20.200\n that melted down glass, silica, aluminum,\n\n3:35:20.200 --> 3:35:21.760\n extruded that using fossil fuels.\n\n3:35:21.760 --> 3:35:23.400\n Where do those fossil fuels come from?\n\n3:35:23.400 --> 3:35:26.200\n Like, so any civilization that's going to be a Dyson,\n\n3:35:26.200 --> 3:35:29.320\n you know, a Kardashev, do they have dinosaurs?\n\n3:35:29.320 --> 3:35:31.280\n Like, do they have like prebiotic life?\n\n3:35:31.280 --> 3:35:32.920\n Do they have a great oxygenation event?\n\n3:35:32.920 --> 3:35:37.400\n Did they have a dimorphism between prokaryotic, eukaryotic?\n\n3:35:37.400 --> 3:35:39.160\n All those hurdles, let's say you give each one,\n\n3:35:39.160 --> 3:35:40.920\n let's say there's eight hurdles.\n\n3:35:40.920 --> 3:35:42.520\n And each one of those has a probability\n\n3:35:42.520 --> 3:35:44.600\n of one in a thousand to go from, you know,\n\n3:35:44.600 --> 3:35:46.760\n eukaryotic, prokaryotic, whatever.\n\n3:35:46.760 --> 3:35:48.120\n Let's say that's a one in a thousand chance.\n\n3:35:48.120 --> 3:35:50.480\n I think it's like one in 10 to the 40th or whatever,\n\n3:35:50.480 --> 3:35:51.320\n if you really do it.\n\n3:35:51.320 --> 3:35:53.200\n But let's say it's first generous nature.\n\n3:35:53.200 --> 3:35:55.040\n One in 10 to the three.\n\n3:35:55.040 --> 3:35:57.080\n Let's say there's eight of those hurdles.\n\n3:35:57.080 --> 3:36:01.120\n That means you have 10 to the 24th power,\n\n3:36:01.120 --> 3:36:03.280\n different possibility.\n\n3:36:03.280 --> 3:36:04.520\n And that's just with eight.\n\n3:36:04.520 --> 3:36:05.760\n Like the moon has to be there.\n\n3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:06.640\n Jupiter has to be there.\n\n3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:07.880\n Dinosaurs had to be there.\n\n3:36:07.880 --> 3:36:08.900\n All the different things that we have\n\n3:36:08.900 --> 3:36:11.040\n to get to technological life.\n\n3:36:11.040 --> 3:36:12.800\n There's only 10 to the, only,\n\n3:36:12.800 --> 3:36:15.240\n there's 10 to the 22nd, we think,\n\n3:36:15.240 --> 3:36:18.900\n Earth, not Earth, planets in the observable universe,\n\n3:36:18.900 --> 3:36:20.420\n not the galaxy.\n\n3:36:20.420 --> 3:36:23.800\n So that's 100 times fewer than the probability\n\n3:36:23.800 --> 3:36:26.360\n to get, you know, 100% clearing these eight\n\n3:36:26.360 --> 3:36:28.820\n very low hurdles of one in a thousand.\n\n3:36:28.820 --> 3:36:30.760\n That's fascinating, because now I really need\n\n3:36:30.760 --> 3:36:32.960\n to listen to your conversation with Lee Cronin,\n\n3:36:32.960 --> 3:36:36.480\n who I believe you had, because he believes the opposite.\n\n3:36:36.480 --> 3:36:37.600\n Yes, I know.\n\n3:36:37.600 --> 3:36:39.760\n Yeah, I want to have a debate with him.\n\n3:36:39.760 --> 3:36:44.760\n He believes that the way biology evolved on Earth\n\n3:36:45.480 --> 3:36:48.920\n could have evolved almost an infinite number of other ways.\n\n3:36:48.920 --> 3:36:51.160\n So like, if you ran Earth over and over and over,\n\n3:36:51.160 --> 3:36:54.280\n you would keep getting life and it would be very different.\n\n3:36:54.280 --> 3:36:59.280\n So it's, the fact that our particular life seems unique\n\n3:37:00.040 --> 3:37:02.280\n is just like, well, because every freaking life\n\n3:37:02.280 --> 3:37:05.040\n is going to seem unique, but it'll be very different.\n\n3:37:05.040 --> 3:37:07.660\n It's not like, we shouldn't be asking the question\n\n3:37:07.660 --> 3:37:11.180\n of what's the likelihood of getting a human like thing?\n\n3:37:12.920 --> 3:37:15.300\n Because that seems to be super special.\n\n3:37:15.300 --> 3:37:20.200\n It's more like, how easy is it to make\n\n3:37:20.200 --> 3:37:21.520\n Slime mold.\n\n3:37:21.520 --> 3:37:23.960\n Anything that has the skills of a human?\n\n3:37:23.960 --> 3:37:26.040\n And I don't mean like something with thumbs,\n\n3:37:26.040 --> 3:37:29.580\n but achieving basically a technological civilization.\n\n3:37:29.580 --> 3:37:33.840\n And according to Lee at least, it's like, it's trivial.\n\n3:37:33.840 --> 3:37:35.560\n I know, we fought, I fought a little bit.\n\n3:37:35.560 --> 3:37:37.000\n I'd love to debate him and I think it'd be a lot of fun.\n\n3:37:37.000 --> 3:37:38.680\n Because we debate with love when I talk with Lee.\n\n3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:40.880\n I love him and he loves me, I think, I hope.\n\n3:37:40.880 --> 3:37:42.440\n But let me ask you a question.\n\n3:37:42.440 --> 3:37:45.920\n I asked this of him and Sarah on our Clubhouse ones.\n\n3:37:45.920 --> 3:37:47.840\n So what do you think would happen the next day?\n\n3:37:47.840 --> 3:37:52.260\n Let's say we discover life, it's Proxima Centauri B.\n\n3:37:52.260 --> 3:37:54.920\n It looks just like Slime mold,\n\n3:37:54.920 --> 3:37:57.800\n like you got on your Brie cheese or whatever.\n\n3:37:57.800 --> 3:38:00.500\n We discover it, what would happen the next day?\n\n3:38:01.400 --> 3:38:03.960\n And they were like, oh, this would be transformative.\n\n3:38:03.960 --> 3:38:06.920\n And I'm not trying to be like Total Cassandra about this,\n\n3:38:06.920 --> 3:38:09.800\n but I said, I don't think anything would happen.\n\n3:38:09.800 --> 3:38:10.640\n And what are you talking about?\n\n3:38:10.640 --> 3:38:12.160\n It would be transformational.\n\n3:38:12.160 --> 3:38:14.240\n I'm like, I stipulate that life exists.\n\n3:38:14.240 --> 3:38:16.760\n Go down to like the river, I'm in San Diego,\n\n3:38:16.760 --> 3:38:19.240\n go down to the Pacific Ocean, scoop up a glass.\n\n3:38:21.280 --> 3:38:22.700\n You're gonna find life in there.\n\n3:38:22.700 --> 3:38:23.620\n And what are we doing?\n\n3:38:23.620 --> 3:38:25.400\n What are we doing to our earth?\n\n3:38:25.400 --> 3:38:27.320\n We're destroying it callously.\n\n3:38:27.320 --> 3:38:29.080\n We're like pumping crap into there.\n\n3:38:29.080 --> 3:38:30.480\n Like we have this toxic waste spill\n\n3:38:30.480 --> 3:38:31.680\n a couple of months ago in San Diego,\n\n3:38:31.680 --> 3:38:33.640\n I couldn't go to the beach.\n\n3:38:33.640 --> 3:38:35.240\n Let me take it a step further.\n\n3:38:35.240 --> 3:38:38.080\n You know how many people, I'm sorry that you do know,\n\n3:38:38.080 --> 3:38:41.520\n but how many people died in the 20th century killed?\n\n3:38:41.520 --> 3:38:44.120\n These are advanced civil, this isn't a slime mold.\n\n3:38:44.120 --> 3:38:48.240\n We kill, we maim, we harm, we hurt, we hate.\n\n3:38:48.240 --> 3:38:50.160\n I don't think anything would happen the next day.\n\n3:38:50.160 --> 3:38:51.000\n Then we go back to what we had.\n\n3:38:51.000 --> 3:38:52.920\n And I said, if that weren't proof enough,\n\n3:38:52.920 --> 3:38:55.280\n life has been discovered at least two or three times\n\n3:38:55.280 --> 3:38:56.560\n just in my professional career.\n\n3:38:56.560 --> 3:39:01.200\n Once in 1996, these Allenland Hills meteorites in Antarctica,\n\n3:39:01.200 --> 3:39:04.400\n they saw like microbial respiration processes.\n\n3:39:04.400 --> 3:39:06.200\n Still we don't know, it was a press conference\n\n3:39:06.200 --> 3:39:08.160\n held by Bill Clinton on the White House lawn\n\n3:39:08.160 --> 3:39:10.640\n that's featured in the movie Contact.\n\n3:39:10.640 --> 3:39:12.000\n My purpose for that movie.\n\n3:39:12.880 --> 3:39:17.200\n And then there's this phosphorus life,\n\n3:39:17.200 --> 3:39:20.920\n this toxic life in the pools of Mono Lake.\n\n3:39:20.920 --> 3:39:24.280\n Many, you know, extremophile, we don't give a crap.\n\n3:39:24.280 --> 3:39:25.440\n We continue to treat.\n\n3:39:25.440 --> 3:39:27.720\n So why are we thinking that like our salvation,\n\n3:39:27.720 --> 3:39:30.640\n from whence will our salvation come as the Bible says?\n\n3:39:30.640 --> 3:39:32.600\n Like it's not gonna change how we are.\n\n3:39:32.600 --> 3:39:36.200\n It's not gonna magnify how I treat you or you treat me.\n\n3:39:36.200 --> 3:39:38.000\n And we're pretty knowledgeable people,\n\n3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:39.800\n you and I compared to, you know, lay people.\n\n3:39:39.800 --> 3:39:40.760\n Okay, that's interesting.\n\n3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:41.920\n That's a really interesting argument.\n\n3:39:41.920 --> 3:39:43.040\n I wonder if you're right.\n\n3:39:43.040 --> 3:39:48.040\n But my intuition is I can maybe present\n\n3:39:49.400 --> 3:39:51.800\n a different argument that you can think about\n\n3:39:51.800 --> 3:39:54.800\n in the realm of things you care about even deeper,\n\n3:39:54.800 --> 3:39:57.200\n which is like what happens once we figure out\n\n3:39:57.200 --> 3:39:58.840\n the origins of the universe?\n\n3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:00.480\n Like how would that change your life?\n\n3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:03.440\n I would say there are certain discoveries\n\n3:40:03.440 --> 3:40:05.000\n that even in their very idea\n\n3:40:05.000 --> 3:40:07.280\n will change the fabric of society.\n\n3:40:07.280 --> 3:40:10.160\n I tend to see if there's definitive proof\n\n3:40:10.160 --> 3:40:12.160\n that there's life and the more complex,\n\n3:40:12.160 --> 3:40:16.720\n the more powerful that idea is elsewhere.\n\n3:40:16.720 --> 3:40:20.440\n That I'm not exactly sure how it will change society\n\n3:40:21.760 --> 3:40:24.560\n because it's such a slap in the face.\n\n3:40:24.560 --> 3:40:28.040\n It's such a humbling force or maybe not.\n\n3:40:28.040 --> 3:40:30.120\n Or maybe it's a motivator to say,\n\n3:40:31.200 --> 3:40:33.040\n yeah, I don't know which force would take over.\n\n3:40:33.040 --> 3:40:36.120\n Maybe it would be governments with military\n\n3:40:36.120 --> 3:40:39.000\n that start to think like, well, how do we kill it?\n\n3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:41.560\n If there's a lot of life out there,\n\n3:40:41.560 --> 3:40:43.080\n how do we create the defenses?\n\n3:40:43.080 --> 3:40:44.600\n How do we extract it?\n\n3:40:44.600 --> 3:40:47.960\n Or mine it for benefits?\n\n3:40:47.960 --> 3:40:50.080\n I mean, I just see like there's 100 million\n\n3:40:50.080 --> 3:40:51.760\n literal counter examples of that.\n\n3:40:51.760 --> 3:40:56.760\n I mean, right now there's like 700 million kids in poverty.\n\n3:40:57.600 --> 3:41:00.120\n How do we go about our life and just not deal with that?\n\n3:41:00.120 --> 3:41:01.720\n I mean, look, I put it aside.\n\n3:41:01.720 --> 3:41:04.840\n I eat hamburgers and in 100 years I'll be canceled\n\n3:41:04.840 --> 3:41:07.200\n for being a carnivore or whatever.\n\n3:41:08.200 --> 3:41:09.640\n So obviously to get through life,\n\n3:41:09.640 --> 3:41:10.760\n you have to make certain compromise.\n\n3:41:10.760 --> 3:41:12.720\n You're not gonna think about certain things.\n\n3:41:12.720 --> 3:41:15.800\n But I just think there is a sort of wish fulfillment.\n\n3:41:15.800 --> 3:41:17.880\n Like every time there's, why are we going to Mars\n\n3:41:17.880 --> 3:41:20.400\n and digging and flying this cool ass helicopter?\n\n3:41:20.400 --> 3:41:21.240\n We're looking for water.\n\n3:41:21.240 --> 3:41:23.680\n Like stipulate that water was there.\n\n3:41:23.680 --> 3:41:25.000\n Like, I believe there was water.\n\n3:41:25.000 --> 3:41:26.120\n I think we should investigate\n\n3:41:26.120 --> 3:41:28.160\n and see what the geology was like.\n\n3:41:28.160 --> 3:41:29.840\n But don't you think, so you're saying?\n\n3:41:29.840 --> 3:41:31.160\n I don't think you're gonna get meaning from it.\n\n3:41:31.160 --> 3:41:32.000\n That's all I'm saying.\n\n3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:33.720\n I'm not saying it's not worth doing.\n\n3:41:33.720 --> 3:41:36.640\n I'm just saying there's a wish fulfillment aspect\n\n3:41:36.640 --> 3:41:39.840\n that people will find meaning for life from science.\n\n3:41:39.840 --> 3:41:44.200\n Okay, but there's a complicated line here.\n\n3:41:44.200 --> 3:41:49.200\n What if it's this intelligent civilization living,\n\n3:41:49.360 --> 3:41:51.560\n obviously probably not on Mars,\n\n3:41:51.560 --> 3:41:55.280\n but somewhere like in a neighboring galaxy that we,\n\n3:41:55.280 --> 3:42:00.280\n sorry, in a neighboring star system that we discover,\n\n3:42:00.280 --> 3:42:02.240\n that we discover,\n\n3:42:02.240 --> 3:42:05.320\n don't you think that profound change in meaning?\n\n3:42:05.320 --> 3:42:06.200\n I mean, I guess, again,\n\n3:42:06.200 --> 3:42:09.080\n I assume that because of this panceramic process\n\n3:42:09.080 --> 3:42:11.800\n or whatever, that the probability is much,\n\n3:42:11.800 --> 3:42:12.920\n much greater than zero.\n\n3:42:12.920 --> 3:42:14.880\n I mean, it's not one, a hundred percent,\n\n3:42:14.880 --> 3:42:16.520\n but it's much likelier than that,\n\n3:42:16.520 --> 3:42:18.960\n that at least some living material from Earth\n\n3:42:18.960 --> 3:42:22.040\n has ejaculated itself into the solar system,\n\n3:42:22.040 --> 3:42:23.000\n into the universe, right?\n\n3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:26.200\n Into our galaxy. Beat that, please, as well.\n\n3:42:26.200 --> 3:42:27.040\n That's right.\n\n3:42:27.040 --> 3:42:29.520\n So like the fact that that could happen\n\n3:42:29.520 --> 3:42:32.240\n and that you're holding a piece from a planetary body,\n\n3:42:32.240 --> 3:42:34.520\n one that couldn't support life as far as we know,\n\n3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:37.560\n but next time, if you play nice\n\n3:42:37.560 --> 3:42:39.000\n and you come on my podcast someday,\n\n3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:40.920\n I will give you a tiny chunk of Mars.\n\n3:42:40.920 --> 3:42:43.560\n So Mars theoretically could support stuff, right?\n\n3:42:43.560 --> 3:42:47.080\n So yeah, so I believe that there could be remnants of Earth\n\n3:42:47.080 --> 3:42:48.960\n so that means there could be evolution.\n\n3:42:48.960 --> 3:42:50.200\n I don't think there's any chance\n\n3:42:50.200 --> 3:42:52.520\n that there's people using iPhones\n\n3:42:52.520 --> 3:42:54.960\n and having podcasts and stuff in Proxima Centauri.\n\n3:42:54.960 --> 3:42:57.240\n There's some chance though, right?\n\n3:42:57.240 --> 3:43:02.240\n So again, I think the simple statement to say,\n\n3:43:02.320 --> 3:43:04.120\n it's much, much, much higher probability\n\n3:43:04.120 --> 3:43:06.920\n that life exists than technological life exists, right?\n\n3:43:06.920 --> 3:43:08.800\n I don't think we can argue that.\n\n3:43:08.800 --> 3:43:09.840\n It doesn't mean it's forbidden.\n\n3:43:09.840 --> 3:43:11.480\n Again, I'm not saying any of this is forbidden,\n\n3:43:11.480 --> 3:43:13.040\n not worth studying, not interesting.\n\n3:43:13.040 --> 3:43:14.080\n It's a likelihood thing.\n\n3:43:14.080 --> 3:43:15.440\n Yeah, and to answer your,\n\n3:43:15.440 --> 3:43:17.120\n I think you're wise to push back\n\n3:43:17.120 --> 3:43:19.600\n and like, what does it matter what I'm doing?\n\n3:43:19.600 --> 3:43:21.360\n And I like to think about that,\n\n3:43:21.360 --> 3:43:23.600\n because it's like, what is the value of what you're doing?\n\n3:43:23.600 --> 3:43:25.320\n Like you have to answer that question\n\n3:43:25.320 --> 3:43:26.560\n or else at the end of your life,\n\n3:43:26.560 --> 3:43:29.680\n you'll have these existential kind of crises, right?\n\n3:43:29.680 --> 3:43:31.640\n So when I think about like who I am,\n\n3:43:31.640 --> 3:43:33.520\n part of my identity is answering\n\n3:43:33.520 --> 3:43:35.440\n and asking scientific questions.\n\n3:43:35.440 --> 3:43:37.880\n For me though, there is a religious kind of undercurrent\n\n3:43:37.880 --> 3:43:41.000\n that does undergird in some sense, this quest.\n\n3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:42.520\n Again, I'm not like a practicing,\n\n3:43:42.520 --> 3:43:44.040\n I'm not like wearing yarmulke,\n\n3:43:44.040 --> 3:43:49.040\n like I'm not like full on into my birth religion, Judaism.\n\n3:43:49.200 --> 3:43:52.040\n But at the same token, I think as,\n\n3:43:52.040 --> 3:43:53.560\n one of the things Einstein did say is that,\n\n3:43:53.560 --> 3:43:55.640\n religion without science is blind\n\n3:43:55.640 --> 3:44:00.640\n or is lame and science without religion is lame,\n\n3:44:00.720 --> 3:44:01.640\n is blind and lame.\n\n3:44:01.640 --> 3:44:03.400\n Anyway, the point is that like,\n\n3:44:03.400 --> 3:44:07.080\n you can't get meaning from just knowing facts.\n\n3:44:07.080 --> 3:44:09.760\n Like Wikipedia knows more than all of us will ever know,\n\n3:44:09.760 --> 3:44:10.600\n right?\n\n3:44:10.600 --> 3:44:11.600\n It has no wisdom.\n\n3:44:11.600 --> 3:44:13.480\n Wisdom, it means sapient.\n\n3:44:13.480 --> 3:44:15.160\n The word wisdom in Latin is sapient.\n\n3:44:15.160 --> 3:44:16.240\n We are wise.\n\n3:44:16.240 --> 3:44:18.480\n And by the way, do you know what we're,\n\n3:44:18.480 --> 3:44:20.840\n our real name is Homo sapiens sapient.\n\n3:44:20.840 --> 3:44:22.760\n So it's man who knows that he knows.\n\n3:44:22.760 --> 3:44:24.200\n Do you know what he knows?\n\n3:44:24.200 --> 3:44:25.320\n Do you know what the knowing is?\n\n3:44:25.320 --> 3:44:27.480\n It's that he's gonna die.\n\n3:44:27.480 --> 3:44:29.600\n We're the only creatures that know that we are gonna die.\n\n3:44:29.600 --> 3:44:31.400\n We don't know when we're gonna die.\n\n3:44:31.400 --> 3:44:33.920\n But like, you know, I have a cat,\n\n3:44:33.920 --> 3:44:36.560\n a fierce attack cat, it's beautiful.\n\n3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:38.280\n She doesn't know when she's gonna die.\n\n3:44:38.280 --> 3:44:40.800\n It doesn't mean I'm more valuable than I think I am.\n\n3:44:40.800 --> 3:44:43.720\n The survival instinct is fundamentally different\n\n3:44:43.720 --> 3:44:46.480\n from like the knowledge of death.\n\n3:44:46.480 --> 3:44:48.120\n And that's where the Ernest Becker comes in\n\n3:44:48.120 --> 3:44:52.080\n with the terror of death and that that's a creative force\n\n3:44:52.080 --> 3:44:55.600\n that seems to be more feature than bug\n\n3:44:55.600 --> 3:44:58.080\n about the human condition is that,\n\n3:45:00.440 --> 3:45:05.080\n I mean, it's a gift of knowing our own mortality.\n\n3:45:06.640 --> 3:45:08.920\n Yeah, to me, I mean, that's why,\n\n3:45:09.960 --> 3:45:11.920\n I agree with you in some sense\n\n3:45:11.920 --> 3:45:14.600\n in terms of the aliens not being a thing\n\n3:45:14.600 --> 3:45:17.080\n that solves all mysteries.\n\n3:45:17.080 --> 3:45:20.280\n That's why my love has always been the human mind.\n\n3:45:20.280 --> 3:45:25.280\n So understanding who we are, what the hell are we?\n\n3:45:25.320 --> 3:45:29.080\n And I think your love has been an echo of that,\n\n3:45:29.080 --> 3:45:32.120\n which is where do we come from?\n\n3:45:32.120 --> 3:45:35.200\n Or basically, as cheesy as it sounds,\n\n3:45:36.760 --> 3:45:39.160\n Michio Kaku is away with words.\n\n3:45:39.160 --> 3:45:42.880\n If you can just like enjoy the, you know.\n\n3:45:42.880 --> 3:45:43.800\n Oh, he speaks in complete,\n\n3:45:43.800 --> 3:45:45.720\n he's like Sam Harris of cosmology.\n\n3:45:45.720 --> 3:45:47.480\n I mean, he speaks in complete paragraphs.\n\n3:45:47.480 --> 3:45:51.560\n But like also unapologetically, he says,\n\n3:45:51.560 --> 3:45:54.440\n we will know God or we will know the mind of God\n\n3:45:54.440 --> 3:45:56.640\n or whatever the quotes, those kinds of things.\n\n3:45:58.480 --> 3:46:02.160\n That's exciting that physics might be able\n\n3:46:02.160 --> 3:46:06.520\n to find equations that unlock our origins\n\n3:46:06.520 --> 3:46:09.160\n at the very core and like the fabric of it all too,\n\n3:46:09.160 --> 3:46:10.680\n and not just our origins.\n\n3:46:13.440 --> 3:46:16.880\n At the beginning, something tells me we're too dumb\n\n3:46:16.880 --> 3:46:19.240\n to truly understand what's at the beginning, but.\n\n3:46:19.240 --> 3:46:21.200\n I think we should be humble in that way.\n\n3:46:21.200 --> 3:46:24.160\n I mean, again, another thing is, you know,\n\n3:46:24.160 --> 3:46:28.320\n you ever hear the saying like we share 99% of our DNA\n\n3:46:28.320 --> 3:46:31.320\n with chimps or bonobos or whatever?\n\n3:46:31.320 --> 3:46:33.240\n I share like probably more than that.\n\n3:46:33.240 --> 3:46:35.440\n Sometimes I wish we shared like 100%.\n\n3:46:35.440 --> 3:46:37.280\n Like that'd be so much more interesting,\n\n3:46:37.280 --> 3:46:41.160\n like, oh, there's 50% of a fruit fly or banana.\n\n3:46:41.160 --> 3:46:42.600\n No, no, no, there's something,\n\n3:46:42.600 --> 3:46:44.680\n but that should make us feel more precious.\n\n3:46:44.680 --> 3:46:46.640\n And I almost feel like discovering life\n\n3:46:46.640 --> 3:46:49.920\n on another planet, whatever solar system\n\n3:46:49.920 --> 3:46:52.240\n would cause a diminution of humanity.\n\n3:46:52.240 --> 3:46:54.600\n Like the one thing I do hold fast to from religion,\n\n3:46:54.600 --> 3:46:56.000\n I don't know where I am with God.\n\n3:46:56.000 --> 3:46:57.160\n Like, do I believe in God?\n\n3:46:57.160 --> 3:46:59.520\n I think that's an unanswerable question,\n\n3:47:00.640 --> 3:47:02.560\n but I have some thoughts about it.\n\n3:47:02.560 --> 3:47:06.320\n But by the same token, I think the one thing I do get\n\n3:47:06.320 --> 3:47:08.560\n from religion is that every human has infinite worth\n\n3:47:08.560 --> 3:47:10.680\n because we are in a religious capacity\n\n3:47:10.680 --> 3:47:12.640\n considered to be equal to God.\n\n3:47:12.640 --> 3:47:15.360\n In other words, we are gods not to be like, you know,\n\n3:47:15.360 --> 3:47:17.040\n but we can contemplate what God did.\n\n3:47:17.040 --> 3:47:18.280\n We have aspects of God.\n\n3:47:18.280 --> 3:47:19.120\n We have free will.\n\n3:47:19.120 --> 3:47:21.400\n God had free will if he exists.\n\n3:47:21.400 --> 3:47:23.040\n Again, I can't prove that God exists,\n\n3:47:23.040 --> 3:47:24.720\n otherwise you wouldn't have any credit\n\n3:47:24.720 --> 3:47:25.560\n for believing in God.\n\n3:47:25.560 --> 3:47:26.380\n This is interesting.\n\n3:47:26.380 --> 3:47:29.860\n I mean, it's like I'm talking to Einstein here,\n\n3:47:29.860 --> 3:47:31.200\n but let me ask anyway.\n\n3:47:31.200 --> 3:47:33.040\n Can you clip that for my clips, John?\n\n3:47:33.040 --> 3:47:38.040\n For somebody who's looking at the young universe,\n\n3:47:39.080 --> 3:47:44.080\n at the early universe, and are talking about God\n\n3:47:44.080 --> 3:47:49.080\n and are agnostic, who do you think is God?\n\n3:47:50.820 --> 3:47:54.800\n So I thought you had just like one of the best podcasts\n\n3:47:54.800 --> 3:47:56.980\n with Sam Harris this past summer.\n\n3:47:57.880 --> 3:48:01.000\n And one of the things I liked about that conversation\n\n3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:04.880\n is he talked a lot about happiness and meditation.\n\n3:48:04.880 --> 3:48:06.660\n And he said something that's really resonated with me,\n\n3:48:06.660 --> 3:48:07.720\n and I've been working it around\n\n3:48:07.720 --> 3:48:09.240\n and trying to work on it my own way.\n\n3:48:09.240 --> 3:48:12.880\n But he said like, you can never be happy\n\n3:48:12.880 --> 3:48:16.240\n if you can only become happy.\n\n3:48:16.240 --> 3:48:18.440\n And I try to take it a little bit further than that,\n\n3:48:18.440 --> 3:48:19.680\n because I think it's interesting.\n\n3:48:19.680 --> 3:48:22.240\n Meditation is like, you're not like, oh, I'm happy,\n\n3:48:22.240 --> 3:48:25.320\n and now like, oh, my kid came in and now I'm not happy.\n\n3:48:25.320 --> 3:48:26.800\n No, you can be satisfied.\n\n3:48:26.800 --> 3:48:28.560\n Kurt Vonnegut said, you ever catch this?\n\n3:48:28.560 --> 3:48:30.400\n Sometimes, Alexa, you're walking around and you're like,\n\n3:48:30.400 --> 3:48:32.800\n life is fricking amazing, I'm happy.\n\n3:48:32.800 --> 3:48:35.440\n And Kurt Vonnegut said, you should say to yourself\n\n3:48:35.440 --> 3:48:37.600\n every time that happens a little mantra,\n\n3:48:37.600 --> 3:48:41.200\n if this isn't goodness, if this isn't happiness, nothing is.\n\n3:48:41.200 --> 3:48:43.160\n Just remind yourself how awesome it is,\n\n3:48:43.160 --> 3:48:46.080\n every breath, everything that you do when you make an impact.\n\n3:48:46.080 --> 3:48:49.520\n Even some of the bad stuff that happens, good, it's good.\n\n3:48:49.520 --> 3:48:51.800\n So Sam said that, and it made me think,\n\n3:48:51.800 --> 3:48:55.040\n because I was like, well, what does it really mean\n\n3:48:55.040 --> 3:48:56.880\n to be happy?\n\n3:48:56.880 --> 3:49:01.880\n Because like, I can think of about two or three ways\n\n3:49:02.200 --> 3:49:04.840\n that right now I could double my happiness.\n\n3:49:04.840 --> 3:49:06.480\n You know, like win the lottery or whatever,\n\n3:49:06.480 --> 3:49:07.560\n like I could double my happiness.\n\n3:49:07.560 --> 3:49:08.940\n There's only a few ways though, right?\n\n3:49:08.940 --> 3:49:12.760\n Like, you know, I had this kind of thought like,\n\n3:49:12.760 --> 3:49:15.320\n how many boats can you water ski behind?\n\n3:49:15.320 --> 3:49:17.060\n Like you had twice as many followers,\n\n3:49:17.060 --> 3:49:19.480\n now you've got 2 million followers, 5 million, whatever.\n\n3:49:19.480 --> 3:49:22.000\n It doesn't do anything, it's called the hedonic treadmill.\n\n3:49:22.000 --> 3:49:23.200\n Like once you get to a certain level,\n\n3:49:23.200 --> 3:49:26.340\n it takes a lot more, you know, change in followers,\n\n3:49:26.340 --> 3:49:28.860\n money, impact, women, whatever you want\n\n3:49:28.860 --> 3:49:32.280\n to make you have one more quanta of happiness, right?\n\n3:49:32.280 --> 3:49:36.220\n On the other hand, this is a concept from entropy.\n\n3:49:36.220 --> 3:49:39.640\n I can make your life miserable in an infinite number of ways.\n\n3:49:39.640 --> 3:49:41.520\n In other words, there's more space\n\n3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:44.520\n to make your life unhappy than happy.\n\n3:49:44.520 --> 3:49:46.200\n And so I thought about that in the context\n\n3:49:46.200 --> 3:49:48.740\n of what Sam said about happiness.\n\n3:49:48.740 --> 3:49:52.360\n So it's sort of like, yeah, it's an expression of entropy.\n\n3:49:52.360 --> 3:49:54.960\n And that what you should be doing in life\n\n3:49:54.960 --> 3:49:59.040\n is doing that which will cause you devastation\n\n3:49:59.040 --> 3:50:00.720\n if it goes away.\n\n3:50:00.720 --> 3:50:02.680\n Because those are the things that like,\n\n3:50:02.680 --> 3:50:05.360\n are where you're reducing entropy,\n\n3:50:05.360 --> 3:50:08.140\n like a kid, like anyone who's a parent\n\n3:50:08.140 --> 3:50:10.320\n knows instantly what I'm talking about.\n\n3:50:10.320 --> 3:50:13.840\n Like how to make your life a billion times worse.\n\n3:50:13.840 --> 3:50:16.400\n But there's no way to make your life a billion times better.\n\n3:50:16.400 --> 3:50:17.840\n And so thinking about that,\n\n3:50:17.840 --> 3:50:21.120\n now turning it to the question of God's existence,\n\n3:50:21.120 --> 3:50:24.440\n I feel like there's no way that you can believe in God\n\n3:50:24.440 --> 3:50:26.280\n to quote, misquote Sam,\n\n3:50:26.280 --> 3:50:29.400\n but there's ways that you can become a believer in God.\n\n3:50:29.400 --> 3:50:31.460\n In other words, you could increase\n\n3:50:31.460 --> 3:50:34.640\n the Bayesian confidence level that there is some,\n\n3:50:34.640 --> 3:50:36.720\n and let's not call it God because that's a freighted term.\n\n3:50:36.720 --> 3:50:38.920\n Let's just call it some infinite source of goodness\n\n3:50:38.920 --> 3:50:42.740\n or our beautiful power in the universe, right?\n\n3:50:42.740 --> 3:50:44.040\n Simple things can do that.\n\n3:50:44.040 --> 3:50:47.800\n You can increase your credulity in the goodness of life.\n\n3:50:47.800 --> 3:50:50.480\n And we have this bias as humans towards negativity,\n\n3:50:50.480 --> 3:50:52.120\n negativity bias, well known fact.\n\n3:50:53.040 --> 3:50:56.280\n So what I wanna do is, let's call it God good, right?\n\n3:50:56.280 --> 3:50:57.960\n That's where it comes from, God good,\n\n3:50:57.960 --> 3:50:59.680\n same words in German.\n\n3:50:59.680 --> 3:51:02.600\n And when we think about what is good,\n\n3:51:02.600 --> 3:51:06.920\n let's do those things that would devastate us.\n\n3:51:06.920 --> 3:51:09.920\n And a lot of that could be relationships.\n\n3:51:09.920 --> 3:51:14.600\n And there's a powerful concept from network theory,\n\n3:51:14.600 --> 3:51:18.160\n which is that the number of connections in a network,\n\n3:51:18.160 --> 3:51:19.640\n you know, I'm just saying it for your own,\n\n3:51:19.640 --> 3:51:21.680\n it grows as the square of the elements in the matrix\n\n3:51:21.680 --> 3:51:22.640\n in the number, right?\n\n3:51:22.640 --> 3:51:24.600\n So you think of a matrix with N people,\n\n3:51:24.600 --> 3:51:26.560\n you know person one, two, three, four,\n\n3:51:26.560 --> 3:51:28.000\n and then there's four other people.\n\n3:51:28.000 --> 3:51:31.660\n There's 16 different pairs, but half of them overlap.\n\n3:51:31.660 --> 3:51:33.280\n The diagonal is where you know each other,\n\n3:51:33.280 --> 3:51:34.640\n you know yourself.\n\n3:51:34.640 --> 3:51:37.060\n But that still grows as N squared.\n\n3:51:37.060 --> 3:51:41.800\n So those connections increase and decrease, right?\n\n3:51:41.800 --> 3:51:43.520\n You ever have two friends that are fighting\n\n3:51:43.520 --> 3:51:44.900\n and like you're kind of upset,\n\n3:51:44.900 --> 3:51:46.640\n even though you're not fighting with either one of them?\n\n3:51:46.640 --> 3:51:48.420\n So like a network grows like that.\n\n3:51:48.420 --> 3:51:50.600\n So you wanna increase your network as much as possible,\n\n3:51:50.600 --> 3:51:54.720\n but only the kind of high quality interstices between them.\n\n3:51:54.720 --> 3:51:56.000\n And I think in doing so,\n\n3:51:56.000 --> 3:51:59.840\n you make yourself fragile, not anti fragile.\n\n3:51:59.840 --> 3:52:02.400\n And I think that is where purpose\n\n3:52:02.400 --> 3:52:05.680\n and maybe approaching some notion of God can come from.\n\n3:52:05.680 --> 3:52:08.140\n So that is a source of meaning,\n\n3:52:08.140 --> 3:52:11.040\n maximizing the goodness in life.\n\n3:52:11.040 --> 3:52:13.200\n And the way you know it's good,\n\n3:52:13.200 --> 3:52:16.640\n is if it's taken away, it would devastate you.\n\n3:52:16.640 --> 3:52:17.480\n That's one way.\n\n3:52:19.160 --> 3:52:21.320\n Think about it, your brand, your business,\n\n3:52:21.320 --> 3:52:23.480\n your spouse, your kids.\n\n3:52:23.480 --> 3:52:24.920\n I mean, parents can't count,\n\n3:52:24.920 --> 3:52:26.760\n I've known parents that have,\n\n3:52:26.760 --> 3:52:28.720\n Jim Simons, here's a perfect example.\n\n3:52:28.720 --> 3:52:30.880\n He's one of my oldest friends and mentors.\n\n3:52:31.920 --> 3:52:35.300\n He is one of the richest people on earth.\n\n3:52:35.300 --> 3:52:37.000\n Gulf Stream, Mega Yacht,\n\n3:52:37.000 --> 3:52:39.840\n this is all documented books about him.\n\n3:52:39.840 --> 3:52:41.720\n He lost two sons as adults.\n\n3:52:42.880 --> 3:52:43.960\n And I hear people say,\n\n3:52:43.960 --> 3:52:46.400\n oh, I'm so jealous of Jim Simons.\n\n3:52:46.400 --> 3:52:47.740\n Would you take everything?\n\n3:52:48.720 --> 3:52:51.120\n I don't know where he has that strength\n\n3:52:51.120 --> 3:52:53.940\n and his wife, Marilyn, and his first wife, Barbara.\n\n3:52:54.980 --> 3:52:57.120\n I'm not like that.\n\n3:52:57.120 --> 3:53:01.120\n Some people are, there are angels that walk among us.\n\n3:53:01.120 --> 3:53:03.840\n And there's this famous prayer.\n\n3:53:03.840 --> 3:53:07.600\n It's like, God, there's an old saying,\n\n3:53:07.600 --> 3:53:09.340\n one of the hardest tests there are in life\n\n3:53:09.340 --> 3:53:10.720\n is to be given a lot of money.\n\n3:53:10.720 --> 3:53:13.480\n And you see it happens with people that win the lottery\n\n3:53:13.480 --> 3:53:15.600\n or whatever, or NFL football players\n\n3:53:15.600 --> 3:53:18.780\n after their career's over, they're broke, right?\n\n3:53:18.780 --> 3:53:20.840\n And I was like, God, please test me with money.\n\n3:53:20.840 --> 3:53:21.680\n That'd be great.\n\n3:53:21.680 --> 3:53:24.840\n But in reality, you should never say,\n\n3:53:24.840 --> 3:53:26.600\n I want what X person has.\n\n3:53:26.600 --> 3:53:28.200\n Unless you're willing to take everything.\n\n3:53:28.200 --> 3:53:30.640\n And you'll find you won't want to take everything.\n\n3:53:32.760 --> 3:53:36.720\n Yeah, I think a lot about the altering effects\n\n3:53:36.720 --> 3:53:39.900\n of fame, of money, of power on people.\n\n3:53:44.080 --> 3:53:45.560\n It blinds people.\n\n3:53:47.360 --> 3:53:50.280\n And I wonder about that for myself\n\n3:53:50.280 --> 3:53:53.720\n because it seems like in themselves,\n\n3:53:53.720 --> 3:53:55.220\n these are definitely not the goals\n\n3:53:55.220 --> 3:53:58.160\n that I'm pretty much afraid.\n\n3:53:58.160 --> 3:54:01.520\n I'm not desirous, and I'm definitely afraid\n\n3:54:01.520 --> 3:54:06.520\n of each of those things, money, fame, and power.\n\n3:54:07.240 --> 3:54:11.880\n But it seems the dreams I have as consequences\n\n3:54:11.880 --> 3:54:14.280\n can often have these things.\n\n3:54:14.280 --> 3:54:16.800\n And I'm really afraid of becoming something\n\n3:54:17.720 --> 3:54:20.740\n that would disappoint me when I was younger,\n\n3:54:20.740 --> 3:54:23.460\n that I wouldn't recognize.\n\n3:54:23.460 --> 3:54:27.180\n You know, because change happens gradually.\n\n3:54:27.180 --> 3:54:30.560\n But are you using yourself as the touchstone\n\n3:54:30.560 --> 3:54:32.380\n to use the assay amount?\n\n3:54:32.380 --> 3:54:36.060\n What is your rubric to apprise if you have lived up\n\n3:54:36.060 --> 3:54:38.860\n to that 12 year old, whatever year old Lex?\n\n3:54:38.860 --> 3:54:41.860\n How will you know or not know if you've let yourself down?\n\n3:54:41.860 --> 3:54:45.060\n Or I always think, live to impress yourself.\n\n3:54:45.060 --> 3:54:47.660\n I don't care if I have followers.\n\n3:54:47.660 --> 3:54:49.300\n It's nice, all right, whatever.\n\n3:54:49.300 --> 3:54:51.660\n But it's hedonic, and it's just never ending\n\n3:54:51.660 --> 3:54:53.660\n because you'll always see the next level.\n\n3:54:53.660 --> 3:54:54.840\n But I think it's pretty damn cool\n\n3:54:54.840 --> 3:54:57.300\n that I've gotten to go to these places, the South Pole,\n\n3:54:57.300 --> 3:54:59.580\n and I've done these things, and I've made a family,\n\n3:54:59.580 --> 3:55:04.000\n and I'm able to teleport my values into the future\n\n3:55:04.000 --> 3:55:07.340\n through my children, and I've had ideological children.\n\n3:55:08.260 --> 3:55:11.180\n So by what metric have you not already,\n\n3:55:11.180 --> 3:55:13.300\n A, impressed yourself, and B, could you let yourself down?\n\n3:55:13.300 --> 3:55:14.380\n I don't want to turn to the therapist.\n\n3:55:14.380 --> 3:55:15.940\n I think some of it is psychology.\n\n3:55:15.940 --> 3:55:20.940\n For me, I'm very much just never highly self critical.\n\n3:55:20.940 --> 3:55:24.300\n I'm never happy, never happy with what I've done.\n\n3:55:24.300 --> 3:55:27.020\n But I'm always happy in the way that you describe,\n\n3:55:27.020 --> 3:55:29.860\n which is that the Vonnegut thing,\n\n3:55:29.860 --> 3:55:34.020\n where you just, often during the day, I will feel,\n\n3:55:34.020 --> 3:55:39.020\n I don't know, I just remember just eating beef jerky\n\n3:55:39.180 --> 3:55:40.820\n and being truly happy.\n\n3:55:40.820 --> 3:55:44.620\n That was just last night, and I have that all the time.\n\n3:55:44.620 --> 3:55:48.900\n And that, to me, is why, I mean,\n\n3:55:48.900 --> 3:55:51.260\n that feels to me like a healthy way to live life,\n\n3:55:51.260 --> 3:55:55.020\n and at least for me, it's the one I really enjoy.\n\n3:55:55.020 --> 3:55:57.620\n A lot of people tell me that maybe being so self critical,\n\n3:55:57.620 --> 3:56:00.480\n so hard on yourself, is not a good way to go.\n\n3:56:00.480 --> 3:56:02.140\n But more and more as I get older,\n\n3:56:02.140 --> 3:56:04.580\n I realize it's just who I am.\n\n3:56:04.580 --> 3:56:08.000\n You have to a certain point accept,\n\n3:56:08.000 --> 3:56:10.700\n this is how I'm always going to be this self critical.\n\n3:56:10.700 --> 3:56:12.140\n It's like the Oracle of Delphi, right?\n\n3:56:12.140 --> 3:56:13.780\n You know thyself.\n\n3:56:13.780 --> 3:56:15.060\n But I want to leave you with one last thing,\n\n3:56:15.060 --> 3:56:16.980\n which is to say, just on this topic,\n\n3:56:16.980 --> 3:56:19.940\n you know, it could be different, right?\n\n3:56:19.940 --> 3:56:22.780\n We could go down to the ocean and get some krill\n\n3:56:22.780 --> 3:56:24.460\n instead of the 711.\n\n3:56:24.460 --> 3:56:28.340\n You know, it could be that we have no other taste buds.\n\n3:56:28.340 --> 3:56:31.220\n And you know, Eric's talked about the four dimensions\n\n3:56:31.220 --> 3:56:33.420\n of the vibration of your tongue, right?\n\n3:56:33.420 --> 3:56:35.900\n It could be like there's one,\n\n3:56:35.900 --> 3:56:39.420\n and it's just like, not Memphis barbecue,\n\n3:56:39.420 --> 3:56:42.700\n whatever you like in your Slim Jim.\n\n3:56:42.700 --> 3:56:44.420\n It could be something, it could be very boring.\n\n3:56:44.420 --> 3:56:47.260\n Similarly, what if like that's a clue?\n\n3:56:47.260 --> 3:56:49.060\n Like what if that's giving us evidence?\n\n3:56:49.060 --> 3:56:50.660\n Here's another clue.\n\n3:56:50.660 --> 3:56:51.520\n There are many animals,\n\n3:56:51.520 --> 3:56:54.380\n most animals have single monocolor vision.\n\n3:56:54.380 --> 3:56:56.940\n They only see in black and white intensity.\n\n3:56:56.940 --> 3:56:59.040\n They only have rods and no cones.\n\n3:57:00.560 --> 3:57:03.060\n We could be like that, but we're not.\n\n3:57:03.060 --> 3:57:04.900\n Why is that not a clue?\n\n3:57:04.900 --> 3:57:08.980\n Like if, like God's not going to like hit you over the head\n\n3:57:08.980 --> 3:57:10.080\n and say like, here I am.\n\n3:57:10.080 --> 3:57:11.360\n Cause then everybody would believe in him.\n\n3:57:11.360 --> 3:57:12.340\n And there's very simplistic.\n\n3:57:12.340 --> 3:57:14.180\n I've had debates even with like famous atheists,\n\n3:57:14.180 --> 3:57:15.500\n like Lawrence Krauss.\n\n3:57:15.500 --> 3:57:17.640\n He's like self declared militant atheist.\n\n3:57:18.560 --> 3:57:20.940\n And I was like, well, I don't believe in the same God\n\n3:57:20.940 --> 3:57:21.860\n you don't believe in.\n\n3:57:21.860 --> 3:57:24.140\n Like some guy in a white beard and a chair,\n\n3:57:24.140 --> 3:57:25.460\n like that's infantile.\n\n3:57:25.460 --> 3:57:27.960\n Like I gave that away a long time ago.\n\n3:57:27.960 --> 3:57:29.380\n But what if there are clues?\n\n3:57:29.380 --> 3:57:31.840\n What if Yang Mills theory and you know,\n\n3:57:31.840 --> 3:57:33.220\n Maxwell's equation, like what?\n\n3:57:33.220 --> 3:57:35.060\n Those are beautiful.\n\n3:57:35.060 --> 3:57:37.100\n If you've ever seen like, you know,\n\n3:57:37.100 --> 3:57:39.840\n expressed in tensor notation, Einstein's equations\n\n3:57:39.840 --> 3:57:41.620\n or Maxwell's equations or,\n\n3:57:41.620 --> 3:57:44.940\n and then Maxwell's equations riding on Einstein's,\n\n3:57:44.940 --> 3:57:47.740\n it's unbelievably beautiful.\n\n3:57:47.740 --> 3:57:49.420\n Doesn't have to be that way.\n\n3:57:49.420 --> 3:57:51.260\n That we can comprehend it.\n\n3:57:51.260 --> 3:57:52.540\n That's a crack.\n\n3:57:52.540 --> 3:57:54.020\n Maybe that's where the light gets in.\n\n3:57:54.020 --> 3:57:56.940\n And the light is what reveals what's beautiful.\n\n3:57:56.940 --> 3:57:59.060\n So I don't believe in God.\n\n3:57:59.060 --> 3:58:00.380\n I think that's a stupid notion.\n\n3:58:00.380 --> 3:58:01.740\n Like, do I believe in God?\n\n3:58:01.740 --> 3:58:04.860\n Like sometimes I wonder if God believes in me,\n\n3:58:04.860 --> 3:58:06.060\n like more than if I believe in,\n\n3:58:06.060 --> 3:58:07.420\n like he needs Brian Keating.\n\n3:58:07.420 --> 3:58:11.180\n Like, you know, it's like one of my friends is a rapper.\n\n3:58:11.180 --> 3:58:14.820\n He's like, what would I be doing if I were God?\n\n3:58:14.820 --> 3:58:16.140\n Exactly what God's doing right now.\n\n3:58:16.140 --> 3:58:17.780\n Like, you think I know more than God?\n\n3:58:17.780 --> 3:58:18.620\n Give me a break.\n\n3:58:18.620 --> 3:58:23.340\n Leaving clues of beauty for these hairless apes.\n\n3:58:23.340 --> 3:58:24.180\n Yeah.\n\n3:58:24.180 --> 3:58:26.180\n And to see what they do with this.\n\n3:58:26.180 --> 3:58:31.180\n And then marvel at both the tragedy\n\n3:58:31.620 --> 3:58:34.580\n of what those apes do to each other\n\n3:58:34.580 --> 3:58:41.580\n and the rare moments of when they understand deeply\n\n3:58:41.580 --> 3:58:43.460\n about how the world works.\n\n3:58:43.460 --> 3:58:45.300\n Brian, you're an incredible human being.\n\n3:58:45.300 --> 3:58:48.540\n I'm a big fan and I'm really honored that he was,\n\n3:58:48.540 --> 3:58:51.820\n first of all, showered me with rocks from the moon.\n\n3:58:51.820 --> 3:58:52.780\n From space.\n\n3:58:52.780 --> 3:58:53.780\n From space.\n\n3:58:53.780 --> 3:58:54.620\n Space dust.\n\n3:58:54.620 --> 3:58:55.460\n Space dust.\n\n3:58:55.460 --> 3:58:56.300\n The villains.\n\n3:58:56.300 --> 3:58:59.180\n Crystals, magical crystals, healing crystals.\n\n3:58:59.180 --> 3:59:00.020\n Yeah.\n\n3:59:00.020 --> 3:59:01.820\n That you can use for good.\n\n3:59:01.820 --> 3:59:05.100\n And tell me your story and spend your really valuable time\n\n3:59:05.100 --> 3:59:05.940\n with me today.\n\n3:59:05.940 --> 3:59:06.780\n This was amazing.\n\n3:59:06.780 --> 3:59:08.020\n That was a great pleasure for me, Lex.\n\n3:59:08.020 --> 3:59:08.860\n Thank you so much.\n\n3:59:10.020 --> 3:59:11.700\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n3:59:11.700 --> 3:59:12.860\n with Brian Keating.\n\n3:59:12.860 --> 3:59:15.940\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors\n\n3:59:15.940 --> 3:59:17.340\n in the description.\n\n3:59:17.340 --> 3:59:19.420\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n3:59:19.420 --> 3:59:21.100\n from Galileo Galilei.\n\n3:59:21.980 --> 3:59:25.340\n In questions of science, the authority of a thousand\n\n3:59:25.340 --> 3:59:29.660\n is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual.\n\n3:59:29.660 --> 3:59:32.620\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
