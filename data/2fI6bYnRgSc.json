00:08.960\n and the former Deputy Administrator of NASA\n\n00:08.960 --> 00:10.720\n and has been a principal investigator\n\n00:10.720 --> 00:13.160\n on four space flight missions.\n\n00:13.160 --> 00:15.060\n Her research interests are in aerospace\n\n00:15.060 --> 00:18.240\n biomedical engineering, investigating human performance\n\n00:18.240 --> 00:20.400\n in varying gravity environments.\n\n00:20.400 --> 00:23.360\n She has designed and engineered and built\n\n00:23.360 --> 00:25.680\n some incredible space suit technology,\n\n00:25.680 --> 00:29.600\n namely the BioSuit that we talk about in this conversation.\n\n00:29.600 --> 00:32.640\n Due to some scheduling challenges on both our parts,\n\n00:32.640 --> 00:34.920\n we only had about 40 minutes together.\n\n00:34.920 --> 00:37.120\n And in true engineering style, she said,\n\n00:37.120 --> 00:41.280\n I talk fast, you pick the best questions, let's get it done.\n\n00:41.280 --> 00:42.320\n And we did.\n\n00:42.320 --> 00:43.880\n It was a fascinating conversation\n\n00:43.880 --> 00:47.360\n about space exploration and the future of spacesuits.\n\n00:47.360 --> 00:50.520\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n00:50.520 --> 00:52.800\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n00:52.800 --> 00:56.160\n give it five stars on Apple Podcast, support it on Patreon,\n\n00:56.160 --> 00:58.200\n or simply connect with me on Twitter\n\n00:58.200 --> 01:02.240\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n01:02.240 --> 01:05.560\n For the first time, this show is presented by Cash App,\n\n01:05.560 --> 01:08.060\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n01:08.060 --> 01:11.080\n Cash App is the easiest way to send money to your friends.\n\n01:11.080 --> 01:12.840\n And it is also the easiest way\n\n01:12.840 --> 01:15.160\n to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin.\n\n01:15.160 --> 01:17.120\n Most Bitcoin exchanges take days\n\n01:17.120 --> 01:19.520\n for a bank transfer to become investable.\n\n01:19.520 --> 01:21.760\n Through Cash App, it takes seconds.\n\n01:21.760 --> 01:25.360\n Invest as little as $1, and now you own Bitcoin.\n\n01:25.360 --> 01:27.280\n I have several conversations about Bitcoin\n\n01:27.280 --> 01:29.060\n coming up on this podcast.\n\n01:29.060 --> 01:30.640\n Decentralized digital currency\n\n01:30.640 --> 01:33.440\n is a fascinating technology in general to explore,\n\n01:33.440 --> 01:37.680\n both at the technical and the philosophical level.\n\n01:37.680 --> 01:39.560\n Cash App is also the easiest way\n\n01:39.560 --> 01:43.120\n to try and grow your money with our new investing feature.\n\n01:43.120 --> 01:44.760\n Unlike investing tools that force you\n\n01:44.760 --> 01:46.620\n to buy entire shares of stock,\n\n01:46.620 --> 01:50.000\n Cash App, amazingly, lets you instantly invest\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:52.240\n as little or as much as you want.\n\n01:52.240 --> 01:54.320\n Some stocks in the market are hundreds,\n\n01:54.320 --> 01:56.320\n if not thousands of dollars per share,\n\n01:56.320 --> 02:01.120\n and now you can still own a piece with as little as $1.\n\n02:01.120 --> 02:04.280\n Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,\n\n02:04.280 --> 02:08.160\n a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.\n\n02:08.160 --> 02:10.960\n I'm also excited to be working with Cash App\n\n02:10.960 --> 02:14.120\n to support one of my favorite organizations called First,\n\n02:14.120 --> 02:16.280\n which is best known for their first robotics\n\n02:16.280 --> 02:19.760\n and Lego competitions that seeks to inspire young students\n\n02:19.760 --> 02:23.560\n in engineering and technology fields all over the world.\n\n02:23.560 --> 02:27.800\n That's over 110 countries, 660,000 students,\n\n02:27.800 --> 02:30.320\n 300,000 mentors and volunteers,\n\n02:30.320 --> 02:33.360\n and a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,\n\n02:33.360 --> 02:35.080\n which means the donated money\n\n02:35.080 --> 02:37.920\n is used to maximum effectiveness.\n\n02:37.920 --> 02:39.440\n When you sign up for Cash App\n\n02:39.440 --> 02:42.540\n and use the promo code LexPodcast,\n\n02:42.540 --> 02:44.720\n you'll instantly receive $10,\n\n02:44.720 --> 02:48.480\n and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,\n\n02:48.480 --> 02:51.000\n an amazing organization that I've personally seen\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:55.120\n inspire girls and boys to learn, to explore,\n\n02:55.120 --> 02:57.960\n and to dream of engineering a better world.\n\n02:57.960 --> 03:02.000\n Don't forget to use the code LexPodcast\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:03.480\n when you download Cash App\n\n03:03.480 --> 03:06.960\n from the App Store or Google Play Store today.\n\n03:06.960 --> 03:10.800\n And now, here's my conversation with Deva Newman.\n\n03:11.800 --> 03:16.040\n You circumnavigated the globe on boat,\n\n03:16.040 --> 03:17.720\n so let's look back in history.\n\n03:17.720 --> 03:21.280\n 500 years ago, Ferdinand Magellan's crew\n\n03:21.280 --> 03:23.460\n was first to circumnavigate the globe,\n\n03:24.480 --> 03:27.760\n but he died, which I think people don't know,\n\n03:27.760 --> 03:32.760\n like halfway through, and so did 242 of the 260 sailors\n\n03:32.880 --> 03:35.320\n that took that three year journey.\n\n03:35.320 --> 03:38.400\n What do you think it was like for that crew at that time\n\n03:38.400 --> 03:43.160\n heading out into the unknown to face probably likely death?\n\n03:43.160 --> 03:46.960\n Do you think they were filled with fear, with excitement?\n\n03:46.960 --> 03:50.040\n Probably not fear, I think in all of exploration,\n\n03:50.040 --> 03:53.560\n the challenge and the unknown, so probably wonderment.\n\n03:53.560 --> 03:57.160\n And then just when you really are sailing the world's oceans,\n\n03:59.160 --> 04:01.580\n you have extreme weather of all kinds.\n\n04:01.580 --> 04:03.800\n When we were circumnavigating, it was challenging,\n\n04:03.800 --> 04:07.340\n a new dynamic, you really appreciate Mother Earth,\n\n04:07.340 --> 04:08.680\n you appreciate the winds and the waves,\n\n04:08.680 --> 04:10.960\n so back to Magellan and his crew,\n\n04:10.960 --> 04:15.240\n since they really didn't have a three dimensional map\n\n04:15.240 --> 04:18.720\n of the globe, of the Earth when they went out,\n\n04:18.720 --> 04:20.380\n just probably looking over the horizon thinking,\n\n04:20.380 --> 04:21.400\n what's there, what's there?\n\n04:21.400 --> 04:24.760\n So I would say the challenge that had to be really important\n\n04:24.760 --> 04:26.800\n in terms of the team dynamics and that leadership\n\n04:26.800 --> 04:29.840\n had to be incredibly important, team dynamics,\n\n04:29.840 --> 04:32.520\n how do you keep people focused on the mission?\n\n04:32.520 --> 04:34.080\n So you think the psychology, that's interesting,\n\n04:34.080 --> 04:36.360\n there's probably echoes of that in the space exploration\n\n04:36.360 --> 04:37.660\n stuff we'll talk about.\n\n04:37.660 --> 04:41.760\n So the psychology of the dynamics between the human beings\n\n04:41.760 --> 04:43.400\n on the mission is important?\n\n04:43.400 --> 04:46.880\n Absolutely, for a Mars mission, it's lots of challenges,\n\n04:46.880 --> 04:48.840\n technology, but since I specialize\n\n04:48.840 --> 04:52.600\n in keeping my astronauts alive, the psychosocial issues,\n\n04:52.600 --> 04:55.800\n the psychology of psychosocial team dynamics, leadership,\n\n04:55.800 --> 04:58.160\n that's, you know, we're all people, so that's gonna be,\n\n04:58.160 --> 05:01.500\n that's always a huge impact, one of the top three,\n\n05:01.500 --> 05:04.600\n I think, of any isolated, confined environment,\n\n05:04.600 --> 05:07.920\n any mission that is really pretty extreme.\n\n05:07.920 --> 05:11.160\n So your Twitter handle is devaexplorer,\n\n05:11.160 --> 05:13.840\n so when did you first fall in love with the idea\n\n05:13.840 --> 05:14.800\n of exploration?\n\n05:14.800 --> 05:17.440\n Ah, that's a great question, you know, maybe as long\n\n05:17.440 --> 05:19.680\n as I can remember, as I grew up in Montana\n\n05:19.680 --> 05:22.120\n in the Rocky Mountains and Helena in the capital,\n\n05:22.120 --> 05:25.460\n and so literally, you know, Mount Helena was my backyard,\n\n05:25.460 --> 05:28.800\n was right up there, so exploring, being in the mountains,\n\n05:28.800 --> 05:31.440\n looking at caves, just running around,\n\n05:31.440 --> 05:36.440\n but always being in nature, so since my earliest memories,\n\n05:36.520 --> 05:40.100\n I, you know, think of myself as kind of exploring\n\n05:40.100 --> 05:44.000\n the natural beauty of the Rocky Mountains where I grew up.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.200\n So exploration is not limited to any domain,\n\n05:46.200 --> 05:49.160\n it's just anything, so the natural domain of any kind,\n\n05:49.160 --> 05:51.720\n so going out to the woods into a place you haven't been,\n\n05:51.720 --> 05:52.960\n it's all exploration.\n\n05:52.960 --> 05:55.380\n I think so, yeah, I have a pretty all encompassing\n\n05:55.380 --> 05:56.800\n definition of exploration.\n\n05:56.800 --> 05:58.200\n So what about space exploration?\n\n05:58.200 --> 06:00.900\n When were you first captivated by the idea\n\n06:00.900 --> 06:05.160\n that we little humans could venture out into the space,\n\n06:05.160 --> 06:06.720\n into the great unknown of space?\n\n06:06.720 --> 06:08.440\n So it's a great year to talk about that,\n\n06:08.440 --> 06:10.680\n the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11,\n\n06:10.680 --> 06:12.720\n as I was alive during Apollo,\n\n06:12.720 --> 06:14.840\n and specifically Apollo 11, I was five years old,\n\n06:14.840 --> 06:19.280\n and I distinctly remember that, I remember that humanity,\n\n06:19.280 --> 06:21.400\n I'm sure I probably didn't know their names at the time,\n\n06:21.400 --> 06:23.560\n you know, there's Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin,\n\n06:23.560 --> 06:26.560\n and never forget Michael Collins in orbit,\n\n06:26.560 --> 06:30.560\n you know, those three men, you know,\n\n06:30.560 --> 06:32.800\n doing something that just seemed impossible,\n\n06:32.800 --> 06:36.920\n seemed impossible a decade earlier, even a year earlier,\n\n06:36.920 --> 06:39.580\n but so the Apollo program really inspired me,\n\n06:39.580 --> 06:42.640\n and then I think it actually just taught me to dream,\n\n06:42.640 --> 06:46.480\n to any impossible mission could be possible\n\n06:46.480 --> 06:49.180\n with enough focus, and I'm sure you need some luck,\n\n06:49.180 --> 06:50.760\n but you definitely need the leadership,\n\n06:50.760 --> 06:53.160\n you need the focus of the mission,\n\n06:53.160 --> 06:55.320\n so since an early age, I thought,\n\n06:55.320 --> 06:57.200\n of course, people, it should be interplanetary,\n\n06:57.200 --> 06:58.520\n of course, people, we need people on Earth,\n\n06:58.520 --> 07:00.960\n and we're gonna have people exploring space as well.\n\n07:00.960 --> 07:04.280\n So that seemed obvious, even at that age, of course.\n\n07:04.280 --> 07:07.080\n It opened it up, before we saw men on the moon,\n\n07:07.080 --> 07:10.120\n it wasn't obvious to me at all, but once we understood\n\n07:10.120 --> 07:12.720\n that yes, absolutely, astronauts, that's what they do,\n\n07:12.720 --> 07:14.080\n they explore, they go into space,\n\n07:14.080 --> 07:16.500\n and they land on other planets or moons.\n\n07:17.360 --> 07:20.680\n So again, maybe a romanticized philosophical question,\n\n07:20.680 --> 07:22.680\n but when you look up at the stars,\n\n07:23.840 --> 07:28.520\n knowing that, you know, there's at least 100 billion\n\n07:28.520 --> 07:30.420\n of them in the Milky Way galaxy, right,\n\n07:30.420 --> 07:34.760\n so we're really a small speck in this giant thing\n\n07:34.760 --> 07:36.600\n that's the visible universe,\n\n07:36.600 --> 07:40.280\n how does that make you feel about our efforts here?\n\n07:40.280 --> 07:42.800\n I love the perspective, I love that perspective,\n\n07:42.800 --> 07:44.660\n I always open my public talks\n\n07:44.660 --> 07:46.760\n with a big Hubble Space Telescope image,\n\n07:46.760 --> 07:48.280\n looking out into, you mentioned just now,\n\n07:48.280 --> 07:49.840\n the solar system, the Milky Way,\n\n07:49.840 --> 07:52.040\n because I think it's really important to know\n\n07:52.040 --> 07:53.880\n that we're just a small, pale, blue dot,\n\n07:53.880 --> 07:56.700\n we're really fortunate, we're on the best planet by far,\n\n07:56.700 --> 07:58.560\n life is fantastic here.\n\n07:58.560 --> 08:00.000\n That we know of, you're confident\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:01.040\n this is the best planet.\n\n08:01.040 --> 08:02.440\n I'm pretty sure it's the best planet,\n\n08:02.440 --> 08:03.800\n the best planet that we know of.\n\n08:03.800 --> 08:05.640\n I mean, I searched my researches, you know,\n\n08:05.640 --> 08:08.040\n in mission worlds, and when will we find life?\n\n08:08.040 --> 08:10.220\n I think actually probably the next decade,\n\n08:10.220 --> 08:11.780\n we find probably past life,\n\n08:11.780 --> 08:14.560\n probably the evidence of past life on Mars, let's say.\n\n08:14.560 --> 08:17.320\n You think there was once life on Mars,\n\n08:17.320 --> 08:19.660\n or do you think there's currently?\n\n08:19.660 --> 08:23.180\n I'm more comfortable saying probably 3.5 billion years ago,\n\n08:23.180 --> 08:24.880\n feel pretty confident there was life on Mars,\n\n08:24.880 --> 08:27.540\n just because then it had an electromagnetic shield,\n\n08:27.540 --> 08:30.800\n it had an atmosphere, has wonderful gravity level,\n\n08:30.800 --> 08:34.360\n three HGs, fantastic, you know, you're all super human,\n\n08:34.360 --> 08:35.800\n we can all slam dunk a basketball,\n\n08:35.800 --> 08:38.580\n I mean, it's gonna be fun to play sports on Mars.\n\n08:38.580 --> 08:40.800\n So I think we'll find past, no, fossilized,\n\n08:40.800 --> 08:43.400\n probably the evidence of past life on Mars.\n\n08:43.400 --> 08:45.480\n Currently, that's okay, we need the next decade,\n\n08:45.480 --> 08:47.600\n but the evidence is mounting for sure.\n\n08:47.600 --> 08:49.880\n We do have the organics, we're finding organics,\n\n08:49.880 --> 08:52.400\n we have water, seasonal water on Mars.\n\n08:52.400 --> 08:54.680\n We used to just know about the ice caps,\n\n08:54.680 --> 08:55.600\n you know, North and South Pole,\n\n08:55.600 --> 08:57.200\n now we have seasonal water.\n\n08:57.200 --> 09:00.320\n We do have the building blocks for life on Mars.\n\n09:00.320 --> 09:02.560\n We really need to dig down into the soil,\n\n09:02.560 --> 09:04.520\n because everything on the top surface is radiated,\n\n09:04.520 --> 09:08.040\n but once we find down, will we see any life forms?\n\n09:08.040 --> 09:08.880\n Will we see any bugs?\n\n09:08.880 --> 09:11.180\n I leave it open as a possibility,\n\n09:11.180 --> 09:13.360\n but I feel pretty certain that past life,\n\n09:13.360 --> 09:15.960\n or fossilized life forms, we'll find.\n\n09:15.960 --> 09:18.360\n And then we have to get to all these ocean worlds,\n\n09:18.360 --> 09:21.380\n these beautiful moons of other planets,\n\n09:21.380 --> 09:22.620\n since we know they have water,\n\n09:22.620 --> 09:26.920\n and we're looking for some simple search for life,\n\n09:26.920 --> 09:28.640\n follow the water, carbon based life,\n\n09:28.640 --> 09:29.960\n that's the only life we know.\n\n09:29.960 --> 09:31.680\n There could be other life forms that we don't know about,\n\n09:31.680 --> 09:33.680\n but it's hard to search for them, because we don't know.\n\n09:33.680 --> 09:36.160\n So in our search for life in the solar system,\n\n09:36.160 --> 09:39.120\n it's definitely search, follow the water,\n\n09:39.120 --> 09:41.200\n and look for the building blocks of life.\n\n09:41.200 --> 09:42.460\n So you think in the next decade,\n\n09:42.460 --> 09:45.360\n we might see hints of past life, or even current life?\n\n09:45.360 --> 09:46.720\n I think so, that's it.\n\n09:46.720 --> 09:47.560\n Pretty optimistic.\n\n09:47.560 --> 09:48.380\n I love the optimism.\n\n09:48.380 --> 09:49.220\n I'm pretty optimistic.\n\n09:49.220 --> 09:50.040\n Do humans have to be involved,\n\n09:50.040 --> 09:52.640\n or can this be robots and rovers and?\n\n09:52.640 --> 09:54.120\n Probably teams, I mean, we've been at it,\n\n09:54.120 --> 09:55.840\n on Mars in particular, 50 years.\n\n09:55.840 --> 09:58.720\n We've been exploring Mars for 50 years, great data, right?\n\n09:58.720 --> 10:01.000\n Our images of Mars today are phenomenal.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.400\n Now we know how Mars lost its atmosphere.\n\n10:03.400 --> 10:04.320\n We're starting to know,\n\n10:04.320 --> 10:07.120\n because of the lack of the electromagnetic shield.\n\n10:07.120 --> 10:08.120\n We know about the water on Mars.\n\n10:08.120 --> 10:10.680\n So we've been studying 50 years with our robots,\n\n10:10.680 --> 10:11.640\n we still haven't found it.\n\n10:11.640 --> 10:13.880\n So I think once we have a human mission there,\n\n10:13.880 --> 10:15.000\n we just accelerate things.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:18.520\n But it's always humans and our rovers and robots together.\n\n10:18.520 --> 10:19.920\n But we just have to think that 50 years,\n\n10:19.920 --> 10:23.000\n we've been looking at Mars, and taking images,\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.080\n and doing the best science that we can.\n\n10:25.080 --> 10:27.480\n People need to realize Mars is really far away.\n\n10:27.480 --> 10:28.720\n It's really hard to get to.\n\n10:28.720 --> 10:31.120\n You know, this is extreme, extreme exploration.\n\n10:31.120 --> 10:32.440\n We mentioned Magellan first,\n\n10:32.440 --> 10:35.480\n or all of the wonderful explorers and sailors of the past,\n\n10:35.480 --> 10:39.140\n which kind of are lots of my inspiration for exploration.\n\n10:39.140 --> 10:40.600\n Mars is a different ball game.\n\n10:40.600 --> 10:42.680\n I mean, it's eight months to get there,\n\n10:42.680 --> 10:44.240\n year and a half to get home.\n\n10:44.240 --> 10:45.680\n I mean, it's really extreme.\n\n10:45.680 --> 10:47.800\n The harsh environment in all kinds of ways.\n\n10:47.800 --> 10:50.880\n But the kind of organisms we might be able to see\n\n10:50.880 --> 10:54.840\n hints of on Mars are kind of microorganisms perhaps.\n\n10:54.840 --> 10:55.680\n Do you think?\n\n10:55.680 --> 10:56.500\n Yeah, and remember that humans,\n\n10:56.500 --> 10:57.900\n we're kind of, you know, we're hosts, right?\n\n10:57.900 --> 11:00.840\n We're hosts to all of our bacteria and viruses, right?\n\n11:00.840 --> 11:02.080\n Do you think it's a big leap\n\n11:02.080 --> 11:06.200\n from the viruses and the bacteria to us humans?\n\n11:07.040 --> 11:10.460\n Put another way, do you think on all those moons,\n\n11:10.460 --> 11:13.240\n beautiful, wet moons that you mentioned,\n\n11:13.240 --> 11:15.840\n you think there's intelligent life out there?\n\n11:15.840 --> 11:16.680\n I hope so.\n\n11:16.680 --> 11:18.600\n I mean, that's the hope, but you know,\n\n11:18.600 --> 11:21.000\n we don't have the scientific evidence for that now.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:24.440\n I think all the evidence we have in terms of life existing\n\n11:24.440 --> 11:26.000\n is much more compelling again,\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.360\n because we have the building blocks of life now.\n\n11:28.360 --> 11:32.920\n When that life turns into intelligence, that's a big unknown.\n\n11:32.920 --> 11:33.880\n If we ever meet,\n\n11:33.880 --> 11:37.180\n do you think we would be able to find a common language?\n\n11:37.180 --> 11:38.080\n I hope so.\n\n11:38.080 --> 11:39.080\n We haven't met yet.\n\n11:39.080 --> 11:42.000\n It's just so far, I mean, do physics just play a role here?\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.440\n Look at all these exoplanets, 6,000 exoplanets.\n\n11:44.440 --> 11:46.840\n I mean, even the couple dozen Earth like planets\n\n11:46.840 --> 11:50.480\n that are exoplanets that really look like habitable planets.\n\n11:50.480 --> 11:51.480\n These are very Earth like.\n\n11:51.480 --> 11:53.940\n They look like they have all the building blocks.\n\n11:53.940 --> 11:54.800\n I can't wait to get there.\n\n11:54.800 --> 11:57.800\n The only thing is they're 10 to 100 light years away.\n\n11:57.800 --> 12:00.200\n So scientifically, we know they're there.\n\n12:00.200 --> 12:01.540\n We know that they're habitable.\n\n12:01.540 --> 12:04.000\n They have, you know, everything going from, right?\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:05.840\n Like, you know, we call them in the Goldilocks zone,\n\n12:05.840 --> 12:06.940\n not too hot, not too cold,\n\n12:06.940 --> 12:10.600\n just perfect for habitability for life.\n\n12:10.600 --> 12:13.240\n But now the reality is if they're 10 at the best\n\n12:13.240 --> 12:15.700\n to 100 to thousands of light years away,\n\n12:17.020 --> 12:18.600\n so what's out there?\n\n12:18.600 --> 12:20.960\n But I just can't think that we're not the only ones.\n\n12:20.960 --> 12:23.280\n So absolutely life, life in the universe,\n\n12:23.280 --> 12:25.840\n probably intelligent life as well.\n\n12:25.840 --> 12:28.000\n Do you think there needs to be fundamental revolutions\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:32.000\n in how we, the tools we use to travel through space\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:35.040\n in order for us to venture outside of our solar system?\n\n12:35.040 --> 12:38.800\n Or do you think the ways, the rockets,\n\n12:38.800 --> 12:41.680\n the ideas we have now, the engineering ideas we have now\n\n12:41.680 --> 12:43.120\n will be enough to venture out?\n\n12:43.120 --> 12:44.000\n Well, that's a good question.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:47.120\n Right now, you know, cause again, speed of light is a limit.\n\n12:47.120 --> 12:49.000\n We don't have a warp speed warp drive\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.880\n to explore our solar system, to get to Mars,\n\n12:51.880 --> 12:53.560\n to explore all the planets.\n\n12:53.560 --> 12:55.720\n Then we need a technology push,\n\n12:55.720 --> 12:57.680\n but technology push here is just advanced propulsion.\n\n12:57.680 --> 13:00.160\n It'd be great if I could get humans to Mars\n\n13:00.160 --> 13:02.460\n and say, you know, three to four months, not eight months.\n\n13:02.460 --> 13:04.560\n I mean, half the time, 50% reduction.\n\n13:04.560 --> 13:08.120\n That's great in terms of safety and wellness of the crew.\n\n13:08.120 --> 13:09.600\n Orbital mechanic, but physics rules,\n\n13:09.600 --> 13:11.320\n you know, orbital mechanics is still there.\n\n13:11.320 --> 13:14.260\n Physics rules, we can't defy physics.\n\n13:14.260 --> 13:15.100\n I love that.\n\n13:15.100 --> 13:16.180\n So invent a new physics.\n\n13:16.180 --> 13:17.280\n I mean, look at quantum, you know,\n\n13:17.280 --> 13:18.240\n look at quantum theory.\n\n13:18.240 --> 13:19.080\n So you never know.\n\n13:19.080 --> 13:21.280\n Exactly, I mean, we are always learning.\n\n13:21.280 --> 13:23.920\n So we definitely don't know all the physics that exist too,\n\n13:23.920 --> 13:27.000\n but we're, we still have to, it's not science fiction.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.200\n You know, we still have to pay attention to physics\n\n13:29.200 --> 13:32.400\n in terms of our speed of travel for space flight.\n\n13:32.400 --> 13:34.880\n So you were the deputy administrator of NASA\n\n13:34.880 --> 13:37.220\n and during the Obama administration,\n\n13:37.220 --> 13:39.560\n there's a current Artemis program\n\n13:39.560 --> 13:41.320\n that's working on a crewed mission to the moon\n\n13:41.320 --> 13:43.440\n and then perhaps to Mars.\n\n13:44.500 --> 13:46.520\n What are you excited about there?\n\n13:46.520 --> 13:48.120\n What are your thoughts on this program?\n\n13:48.120 --> 13:49.920\n What are the biggest challenges do you think\n\n13:49.920 --> 13:53.640\n of getting to the moon, of landing to the moon once again,\n\n13:53.640 --> 13:57.400\n and then the big step to Mars?\n\n13:57.400 --> 14:00.400\n Well, I love, you know, the moon program now, Artemis.\n\n14:00.400 --> 14:02.520\n It is definitely, we've been in low earth orbit.\n\n14:02.520 --> 14:03.600\n I love low earth orbit too,\n\n14:03.600 --> 14:05.880\n but I just always look at it as three phases.\n\n14:05.880 --> 14:07.980\n So low earth orbit where we've been 40 years,\n\n14:07.980 --> 14:10.080\n so definitely time to get back to deep space,\n\n14:10.080 --> 14:11.000\n time to get to the moon.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.720\n There's so much to do on the moon.\n\n14:13.720 --> 14:16.100\n I hope we don't get stuck on the moon for 50 years.\n\n14:16.100 --> 14:19.000\n I really want to get to the moon, spend the next decade,\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:20.720\n first with the lander, then humans.\n\n14:20.720 --> 14:21.960\n There's just a lot to explore,\n\n14:21.960 --> 14:24.440\n but to me it's a big technology push.\n\n14:24.440 --> 14:25.340\n It's only three days away.\n\n14:25.340 --> 14:27.680\n So the moon is definitely the right place.\n\n14:27.680 --> 14:29.600\n So we kind of buy down our technology.\n\n14:29.600 --> 14:33.840\n We invest in specifically habitats, life support systems.\n\n14:33.840 --> 14:34.720\n So we need suits.\n\n14:34.720 --> 14:37.780\n We really need to understand really how to live off planet.\n\n14:37.780 --> 14:39.480\n We've been off planet and low earth orbit,\n\n14:39.480 --> 14:42.780\n but still that's only 400 kilometers up, 250 miles, right?\n\n14:42.780 --> 14:43.840\n So we get to the moon.\n\n14:43.840 --> 14:47.320\n It really is a great proving ground for the technologies.\n\n14:47.320 --> 14:50.840\n And now we're in deep space, radiation becomes a huge issue\n\n14:50.840 --> 14:52.440\n and to keep our astronauts well and alive.\n\n14:52.440 --> 14:57.440\n And I look at all of that investment for moon exploration\n\n14:57.480 --> 15:00.680\n to the ultimate goal, the horizon goals we call it,\n\n15:00.680 --> 15:01.860\n to get people to Mars.\n\n15:01.860 --> 15:03.720\n But we just don't go to Mars tomorrow, right?\n\n15:03.720 --> 15:05.740\n We really need a decade on the moon, I think,\n\n15:05.740 --> 15:07.680\n investing in the technologies, learning,\n\n15:07.680 --> 15:09.960\n making sure the astronauts are, their health,\n\n15:09.960 --> 15:11.600\n they're safe and well,\n\n15:11.600 --> 15:15.920\n and also learning so much about in situ research utilization,\n\n15:15.920 --> 15:19.080\n ISRU, in situ resource utilization is huge\n\n15:19.080 --> 15:21.160\n when it comes to exploration for the moon and Mars.\n\n15:21.160 --> 15:23.160\n So we need a test bed.\n\n15:23.160 --> 15:26.860\n And to me, it really is a lunar test bed.\n\n15:26.860 --> 15:29.300\n And then we use those same investments\n\n15:29.300 --> 15:32.520\n to think about getting people to Mars in the 2030s.\n\n15:32.520 --> 15:34.040\n So developing sort of a platform\n\n15:34.040 --> 15:36.200\n of all the kind of research tools of all the,\n\n15:36.200 --> 15:39.040\n what's the resource utilization, can you speak to that?\n\n15:39.040 --> 15:42.000\n Yeah, so ISRU for the moon, it's,\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:45.200\n we'll go to the South Pole and it's fascinating.\n\n15:45.200 --> 15:46.720\n We have images of it.\n\n15:46.720 --> 15:49.040\n Of course, we know there's permanently shaded areas\n\n15:49.040 --> 15:50.880\n and like by Shackleton crater,\n\n15:50.880 --> 15:53.320\n and there's areas that are permanently in the sun.\n\n15:53.320 --> 15:56.480\n Well, it seems that there's a lot of water ice,\n\n15:56.480 --> 16:00.000\n water that's entrapped in ice and the lunar craters.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:01.260\n That's the first place you go.\n\n16:01.260 --> 16:02.100\n Why?\n\n16:02.100 --> 16:03.880\n Because it's water and when you wanna try to,\n\n16:03.880 --> 16:06.160\n it could be fuel, life support systems.\n\n16:06.160 --> 16:08.800\n So you kind of, again, you go where the water is.\n\n16:08.800 --> 16:12.680\n And so when the moon is kind of for resources utilization,\n\n16:12.680 --> 16:13.560\n but to learn how to,\n\n16:13.560 --> 16:16.000\n can we make the fuels out of the resources\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:16.900\n that are on the moon?\n\n16:16.900 --> 16:18.240\n We have to think about 3D printing, right?\n\n16:18.240 --> 16:20.120\n You don't get to bring all this mass with you.\n\n16:20.120 --> 16:22.800\n You have to learn how to literally live off the land.\n\n16:22.800 --> 16:24.240\n We need a pressure shell.\n\n16:24.240 --> 16:28.320\n We need to have an atmosphere for people to live in.\n\n16:28.320 --> 16:31.040\n So all of that is kind of buying down the technology,\n\n16:31.040 --> 16:32.960\n doing the investigation, doing the science.\n\n16:32.960 --> 16:35.520\n What are the basically called lunar volatiles?\n\n16:35.520 --> 16:38.140\n What is that ice on the moon?\n\n16:38.140 --> 16:40.200\n How much of it is there?\n\n16:40.200 --> 16:42.120\n What are the resources look like?\n\n16:42.120 --> 16:44.320\n To me, that helps us, that's just the next step\n\n16:44.320 --> 16:46.480\n in getting humans to Mars.\n\n16:46.480 --> 16:47.800\n You know, it's cheaper and more effective\n\n16:47.800 --> 16:50.160\n to sort of develop some of these difficult challenges,\n\n16:50.160 --> 16:51.640\n like solve some of these challenges,\n\n16:51.640 --> 16:53.960\n practice, develop, test, and so on on the moon.\n\n16:53.960 --> 16:55.000\n Absolutely. That is on Mars.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:55.820\n Absolutely.\n\n16:55.820 --> 16:56.660\n And people are gonna love to, you know,\n\n16:56.660 --> 16:57.500\n you get to the moon, you get to,\n\n16:57.500 --> 16:58.880\n you have a beautiful Earthrise.\n\n16:58.880 --> 17:01.160\n I mean, you have the most magnificent view of Earth\n\n17:01.160 --> 17:02.520\n being off planet.\n\n17:02.520 --> 17:03.500\n So it just makes sense.\n\n17:03.500 --> 17:05.320\n I think we're gonna have thousands, lots of people,\n\n17:05.320 --> 17:06.840\n hopefully tens of thousands in low Earth orbit,\n\n17:06.840 --> 17:08.960\n because low Earth orbit is a beautiful place to go\n\n17:08.960 --> 17:09.780\n and look down on the Earth,\n\n17:09.780 --> 17:11.080\n but people wanna return home.\n\n17:11.080 --> 17:12.720\n I think the lunar explorers\n\n17:12.720 --> 17:15.400\n will also wanna do round trips\n\n17:15.400 --> 17:17.800\n and, you know, be on the moon, three day trip,\n\n17:17.800 --> 17:20.560\n explore, do science, also because the lunar day\n\n17:20.560 --> 17:23.600\n is 14 days and lunar nights, also 14 days.\n\n17:23.600 --> 17:26.080\n So in that 28 day cycle, you know,\n\n17:26.080 --> 17:28.460\n half of it is in light, half of it's in dark.\n\n17:29.280 --> 17:31.840\n So people would probably wanna do, you know,\n\n17:31.840 --> 17:33.760\n couple of week trips, month long trips,\n\n17:33.760 --> 17:34.720\n not longer than that.\n\n17:34.720 --> 17:36.400\n What do you mean by people?\n\n17:36.400 --> 17:37.400\n People, explorers.\n\n17:37.400 --> 17:41.000\n I mean, yeah, astronauts are gonna be civilians\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:41.840\n in the future too.\n\n17:41.840 --> 17:44.320\n Not all astronauts are gonna be government astronauts.\n\n17:44.320 --> 17:45.640\n Actually, when I was at NASA, we changed,\n\n17:45.640 --> 17:48.720\n we actually got the law changed to recognize astronauts\n\n17:48.720 --> 17:50.360\n that are not only government employees,\n\n17:50.360 --> 17:51.360\n you know, NASA astronauts\n\n17:51.360 --> 17:52.840\n or European Space Agency astronauts\n\n17:52.840 --> 17:54.960\n or Russian Space Agency that astronauts,\n\n17:54.960 --> 17:58.320\n because of the big push we put on the private sector,\n\n17:58.320 --> 17:59.920\n that astronauts essentially are gonna be astronauts.\n\n17:59.920 --> 18:02.820\n You get over 100 kilometers up\n\n18:02.820 --> 18:06.520\n and think once you've done orbital flight,\n\n18:06.520 --> 18:07.600\n then you're an astronaut.\n\n18:07.600 --> 18:10.400\n So a lot of private citizens are gonna become astronauts.\n\n18:10.400 --> 18:13.360\n Do you think one day you might step foot on the moon?\n\n18:13.360 --> 18:14.560\n I think it'd be good to go to the moon.\n\n18:14.560 --> 18:16.200\n I'd give that a shot.\n\n18:16.200 --> 18:18.120\n Mars, I'm gonna, it's my life's work\n\n18:18.120 --> 18:20.320\n to get the next generation to Mars.\n\n18:20.320 --> 18:22.960\n That's you or even younger than you,\n\n18:22.960 --> 18:24.920\n you know, my students generation\n\n18:24.920 --> 18:26.680\n will be the Martian explorers.\n\n18:26.680 --> 18:28.920\n I'm just working to facilitate that,\n\n18:28.920 --> 18:30.240\n but that's not gonna be me.\n\n18:30.240 --> 18:31.200\n Hey, the moon's pretty good.\n\n18:31.200 --> 18:32.880\n And it's a lot tough.\n\n18:32.880 --> 18:35.840\n I mean, it's still a really tough mission.\n\n18:35.840 --> 18:37.280\n It's an extreme mission, exactly.\n\n18:37.280 --> 18:39.960\n It's great for exploration, but doable,\n\n18:39.960 --> 18:41.160\n but again, before Apollo,\n\n18:41.160 --> 18:44.000\n we didn't think getting humans to the moon was even possible.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.500\n So we kind of made that possible, but we need to go back.\n\n18:46.500 --> 18:47.960\n We absolutely need to go back.\n\n18:47.960 --> 18:50.400\n We're investing in the heavy lift launch capabilities\n\n18:50.400 --> 18:51.240\n that we need to get there.\n\n18:51.240 --> 18:52.080\n We haven't had that, you know,\n\n18:52.080 --> 18:53.960\n since the Apollo days, since Saturn five.\n\n18:53.960 --> 18:56.480\n So now we have three options on the board.\n\n18:56.480 --> 18:57.480\n That's what's so fantastic.\n\n18:57.480 --> 18:59.760\n NASA has its space launch system.\n\n18:59.760 --> 19:02.720\n SpaceX is gonna have its heavy capability\n\n19:02.720 --> 19:05.320\n and Blue Origin is coming along too with heavy lifts.\n\n19:05.320 --> 19:07.840\n So that's pretty fantastic from where I sit.\n\n19:07.840 --> 19:09.880\n I'm the Apollo program professor.\n\n19:09.880 --> 19:12.040\n Today I have zero heavy lift launch capability.\n\n19:12.040 --> 19:13.680\n I can't wait, just in a few years,\n\n19:13.680 --> 19:16.020\n we'll have three different heavy lift launch capabilities.\n\n19:16.020 --> 19:18.120\n So that's pretty exciting.\n\n19:18.120 --> 19:20.600\n You know, your heart is perhaps with NASA,\n\n19:20.600 --> 19:23.480\n but you mentioned SpaceX and Blue Origin.\n\n19:23.480 --> 19:26.900\n What are your thoughts of SpaceX\n\n19:26.900 --> 19:28.720\n and the innovative efforts there\n\n19:28.720 --> 19:31.360\n from the sort of private company aspect?\n\n19:31.360 --> 19:32.200\n Oh, they're great.\n\n19:32.200 --> 19:35.320\n They're, remember that the investments in SpaceX\n\n19:35.320 --> 19:36.420\n is government funding.\n\n19:36.420 --> 19:39.240\n It's NASA funding, it's US Air Force funding,\n\n19:39.240 --> 19:40.480\n just as it should be,\n\n19:40.480 --> 19:44.160\n because they're betting on a company who is moving fast,\n\n19:44.160 --> 19:46.380\n has some new technology development.\n\n19:46.380 --> 19:47.220\n So I love it.\n\n19:47.220 --> 19:48.060\n So when I was at NASA,\n\n19:48.060 --> 19:50.320\n it really was under our public private partnerships.\n\n19:50.320 --> 19:53.440\n So necessarily the government needs to fund\n\n19:53.440 --> 19:54.520\n these startups.\n\n19:54.520 --> 19:56.240\n Now, SpaceX is no longer a startup,\n\n19:56.240 --> 19:58.240\n but you know, it's been at it for 10 years.\n\n19:58.240 --> 20:00.640\n It's had some accidents, learned a lot of lessons,\n\n20:00.640 --> 20:03.800\n but it's great because it's the way you move faster.\n\n20:03.800 --> 20:06.240\n And also some private industry folks,\n\n20:06.240 --> 20:08.740\n some private businesses will take a lot more risk.\n\n20:08.740 --> 20:11.400\n That's also really important for the government.\n\n20:11.400 --> 20:13.000\n What do you think about that culture of risk?\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.360\n I mean, sort of NASA and the government\n\n20:15.360 --> 20:18.160\n are exceptionally good at delivering sort of safe,\n\n20:18.160 --> 20:21.640\n like there's a bit more of a culture of caution and safety\n\n20:21.640 --> 20:23.440\n and sort of this kind of solid engineering.\n\n20:23.440 --> 20:26.080\n And I think SpaceX as well has the same kind of stuff.\n\n20:26.080 --> 20:28.160\n It has a little bit more of that startup feel\n\n20:28.160 --> 20:29.840\n where they take the bigger risks.\n\n20:29.840 --> 20:31.720\n Is that exciting for you to see,\n\n20:31.720 --> 20:33.840\n seeing bigger risks in this kind of space?\n\n20:33.840 --> 20:34.960\n Absolutely.\n\n20:34.960 --> 20:38.520\n And the best scenario is both of them working together\n\n20:38.520 --> 20:40.120\n because there's really important lessons learned,\n\n20:40.120 --> 20:41.880\n especially when you talk about human space flight,\n\n20:41.880 --> 20:43.760\n safety, quality assurance.\n\n20:43.760 --> 20:46.000\n These things are the utmost importance,\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:47.840\n both aviation and space, you know,\n\n20:47.840 --> 20:49.280\n when human lives are at stake.\n\n20:49.280 --> 20:51.760\n On the other hand, government agencies,\n\n20:51.760 --> 20:53.840\n NASA can be European Space Agency, you name it,\n\n20:53.840 --> 20:56.780\n they become very bureaucratic, pretty risk averse,\n\n20:56.780 --> 20:58.100\n move pretty slowly.\n\n20:58.100 --> 21:01.380\n So I think the best is when you combine the partnerships\n\n21:01.380 --> 21:02.220\n from both sides.\n\n21:03.360 --> 21:05.360\n Industry necessarily has to push the government,\n\n21:05.360 --> 21:06.200\n take some more risks.\n\n21:06.200 --> 21:07.160\n You know, they're smart risk\n\n21:07.160 --> 21:09.960\n or actually gave an award at NASA for failing smart.\n\n21:09.960 --> 21:12.560\n Failing smart, I love that.\n\n21:12.560 --> 21:13.920\n You know, so you can kind of break open the culture,\n\n21:13.920 --> 21:16.340\n say, no, look at Apollo, that was a huge risk.\n\n21:16.340 --> 21:17.600\n It was done well.\n\n21:17.600 --> 21:20.520\n So there's always a culture of safety, quality assurance,\n\n21:20.520 --> 21:23.320\n you know, engineering, you know, at its best.\n\n21:23.320 --> 21:26.100\n But on the other hand, you want to get things done\n\n21:26.100 --> 21:27.520\n and you have to also get them,\n\n21:27.520 --> 21:28.980\n you have to bring the cost down.\n\n21:28.980 --> 21:29.940\n You know, for when it comes to launch,\n\n21:29.940 --> 21:31.040\n we really have to bring the cost down\n\n21:31.040 --> 21:32.320\n and get the frequency up.\n\n21:32.320 --> 21:34.120\n And so that's what the newcomers are doing.\n\n21:34.120 --> 21:35.520\n They're really pushing that.\n\n21:35.520 --> 21:37.840\n So it's about the most exciting time\n\n21:37.840 --> 21:39.680\n that I can imagine for space flight.\n\n21:39.680 --> 21:41.800\n Again, a little bit, it really is the democratization\n\n21:41.800 --> 21:43.320\n of space flight, opening it up,\n\n21:43.320 --> 21:45.200\n not just because of the launch capability,\n\n21:45.200 --> 21:47.560\n but the science we can do on a CubeSat.\n\n21:47.560 --> 21:49.560\n What you can do now for very,\n\n21:49.560 --> 21:51.920\n those used to be, you know, student projects\n\n21:51.920 --> 21:54.080\n that we would go through, conceive, design, implement,\n\n21:54.080 --> 21:56.360\n and think about what a small satellite would be.\n\n21:56.360 --> 21:58.080\n Now they're the most, you know,\n\n21:58.080 --> 21:59.800\n these are really advanced instruments,\n\n21:59.800 --> 22:02.520\n science instruments that are flying on little teeny CubeSats\n\n22:02.520 --> 22:04.600\n that pretty much anyone can afford.\n\n22:04.600 --> 22:06.960\n So there's not a, there's every nation,\n\n22:06.960 --> 22:10.320\n you know, every place in the world can fly a CubeSat.\n\n22:10.320 --> 22:11.160\n And so that's...\n\n22:11.160 --> 22:12.000\n What's a CubeSat?\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:15.160\n Oh, CubeSat is a, this is called 1U.\n\n22:15.160 --> 22:17.000\n CubeSats we measure in terms of units.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.360\n So, you know, just in terms of, I put my,\n\n22:19.360 --> 22:21.560\n both my hands together, that's one unit, two units.\n\n22:21.560 --> 22:22.720\n So little small satellites.\n\n22:22.720 --> 22:25.480\n So CubeSats are for small satellites.\n\n22:25.480 --> 22:26.940\n And we actually go by mass as well.\n\n22:26.940 --> 22:29.340\n You know, a small satellite might be a hundred kilos,\n\n22:29.340 --> 22:32.400\n 200 kilos, all well under a thousand kilos.\n\n22:32.400 --> 22:35.020\n CubeSats then are the next thing down from small sats.\n\n22:35.020 --> 22:37.320\n You know, basically, you know,\n\n22:37.320 --> 22:39.480\n kilos, tens of kilos, things like that.\n\n22:39.480 --> 22:41.200\n But kind of the building blocks,\n\n22:41.200 --> 22:42.560\n CubeSats are fantastic design,\n\n22:42.560 --> 22:44.080\n it's kind of modular design.\n\n22:44.080 --> 22:47.760\n So I can take a 1U, one unit of CubeSat and, you know,\n\n22:47.760 --> 22:50.300\n but what if I have a little bit more money and payload,\n\n22:50.300 --> 22:51.520\n I can fly three of them\n\n22:51.520 --> 22:54.080\n and just basically put a lot more instruments on it.\n\n22:54.080 --> 22:55.560\n But essentially think about something\n\n22:55.560 --> 22:57.740\n the size of a shoe box, if you will.\n\n22:57.740 --> 22:59.560\n You know, that would be a CubeSat.\n\n22:59.560 --> 23:02.840\n And how do those help empower you in terms of doing size,\n\n23:02.840 --> 23:04.000\n in terms of doing experiments?\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:05.680\n Oh, right now there's, again,\n\n23:05.680 --> 23:07.600\n back to private industry, Planet, the company,\n\n23:07.600 --> 23:08.880\n is, you know, flying CubeSats\n\n23:08.880 --> 23:10.880\n and literally looking down on Earth\n\n23:10.880 --> 23:13.600\n and orbiting Earth, taking a picture, if you will,\n\n23:13.600 --> 23:15.560\n of Earth every day, every 24 hours,\n\n23:15.560 --> 23:16.560\n covering the entire Earth.\n\n23:16.560 --> 23:19.160\n So in terms of Earth observations,\n\n23:19.160 --> 23:20.240\n in terms of climate change,\n\n23:20.240 --> 23:22.140\n in terms of our changing Earth,\n\n23:22.140 --> 23:24.940\n it's revolutionizing because they're affordable.\n\n23:24.940 --> 23:26.480\n We can put a whole bunch of them up.\n\n23:26.480 --> 23:28.600\n Telecoms, we're all, you know, on our cell phones\n\n23:28.600 --> 23:30.760\n and we have GPS, we have our telecoms,\n\n23:30.760 --> 23:33.820\n but those used to be very expensive satellites\n\n23:33.820 --> 23:34.960\n providing that service.\n\n23:34.960 --> 23:38.580\n Now we can fly a whole bunch of modular CubeSats.\n\n23:38.580 --> 23:42.460\n So it really is breakthrough in terms of modularity,\n\n23:42.460 --> 23:44.280\n as well as cost reduction.\n\n23:44.280 --> 23:47.380\n So that's one exciting set of developments.\n\n23:47.380 --> 23:51.080\n Is there something else that you've been excited about,\n\n23:51.080 --> 23:52.600\n like reusable rockets, perhaps,\n\n23:52.600 --> 23:54.100\n that you've seen in the last few years?\n\n23:54.100 --> 23:55.440\n Yeah, well, the reusability you had,\n\n23:55.440 --> 23:57.520\n and the reusability is awesome.\n\n23:57.520 --> 23:59.200\n I mean, it's just the best.\n\n23:59.200 --> 24:01.600\n Now we have to remember, the shuttle was a reusable vehicle.\n\n24:01.600 --> 24:02.440\n Yes.\n\n24:02.440 --> 24:04.440\n Which, and the shuttle is an amazing,\n\n24:04.440 --> 24:05.520\n it's narrow space engineer.\n\n24:05.520 --> 24:06.460\n You know, I mean, the shuttle is still,\n\n24:06.460 --> 24:09.160\n this is the most gorgeous, elegant,\n\n24:09.160 --> 24:12.400\n extraordinary design of a space vehicle.\n\n24:12.400 --> 24:15.320\n It was reusable, it just wasn't affordable.\n\n24:15.320 --> 24:18.080\n But the reusability of it was really critical\n\n24:18.080 --> 24:19.660\n because we flew it up, it did come back.\n\n24:19.660 --> 24:23.640\n So the notion of reusability, I think absolutely.\n\n24:23.640 --> 24:26.480\n Now what we're doing with we, you know,\n\n24:26.480 --> 24:29.160\n the Global We, but with SpaceX and Lord Jim,\n\n24:29.160 --> 24:31.440\n setting the rockets up, recovering the first stages,\n\n24:31.440 --> 24:35.360\n where if they can regain 70% cost savings, that's huge.\n\n24:35.360 --> 24:37.800\n And just seeing the control,\n\n24:37.800 --> 24:39.940\n you know, being in control and dynamic as a person,\n\n24:39.940 --> 24:41.680\n just seeing that rocket come back and land.\n\n24:41.680 --> 24:42.600\n Oh yeah, that's.\n\n24:42.600 --> 24:45.040\n It never gets old, it's exciting every single time\n\n24:45.040 --> 24:46.720\n you look at it and say, that's magic.\n\n24:46.720 --> 24:48.080\n So it's so cool.\n\n24:48.080 --> 24:49.480\n To me, the landing is where I stand up,\n\n24:49.480 --> 24:51.320\n start clapping, just the control.\n\n24:51.320 --> 24:53.820\n Yeah, just the algorithm, just the control algorithms,\n\n24:53.820 --> 24:55.620\n and hitting that landing, it's, you know,\n\n24:55.620 --> 24:58.320\n it's gymnastics for rocket ships,\n\n24:58.320 --> 25:01.080\n but to see these guys stick a landing,\n\n25:01.080 --> 25:01.920\n it's just wonderful.\n\n25:01.920 --> 25:04.320\n So every time, like I say, every time I see,\n\n25:05.200 --> 25:07.440\n you know, the reusability and the rockets coming back\n\n25:07.440 --> 25:09.800\n and landing so precisely, it's really exciting.\n\n25:09.800 --> 25:12.320\n So it is actually, that's a game changer.\n\n25:12.320 --> 25:15.120\n We are in a new era of lower costs\n\n25:15.120 --> 25:17.520\n and the higher frequency.\n\n25:17.520 --> 25:19.600\n And it's the world, not just NASA,\n\n25:19.600 --> 25:23.840\n many nations are really upping their frequency of launches.\n\n25:23.840 --> 25:25.720\n So you've done a lot of exciting research,\n\n25:25.720 --> 25:28.960\n design, engineering on spacesuits.\n\n25:28.960 --> 25:33.120\n What does the spacesuit of the future look like?\n\n25:33.120 --> 25:34.520\n Well, if I have anything to say about it,\n\n25:34.520 --> 25:37.280\n it'll be a very, it'll be a very tight fitting suit.\n\n25:37.280 --> 25:38.880\n We use mechanical counter pressure\n\n25:38.880 --> 25:41.080\n to pressurize right directly on the skin.\n\n25:41.080 --> 25:42.880\n Seems that it's technically feasible.\n\n25:42.880 --> 25:44.400\n We're still at the research and development stage.\n\n25:44.400 --> 25:47.000\n We don't have a flight system, but technically it's feasible.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:48.720\n So we do a lot of work in the materials.\n\n25:48.720 --> 25:51.400\n You know, what materials do we need to pressurize someone?\n\n25:51.400 --> 25:52.720\n What's the patterning we need?\n\n25:52.720 --> 25:54.760\n That's what our patents are in, the patterning,\n\n25:54.760 --> 25:55.640\n kind of how we apply.\n\n25:55.640 --> 25:57.440\n This is a third of an atmosphere.\n\n25:57.440 --> 25:59.220\n Just to sort of take a little step back,\n\n25:59.220 --> 26:02.240\n you have this incredible biosuit where it's tight fitting,\n\n26:02.240 --> 26:04.400\n so it allows more mobility and so on.\n\n26:04.400 --> 26:06.240\n So maybe even to take a bigger step back,\n\n26:06.240 --> 26:09.480\n like what are the functions that a spacesuit should perform?\n\n26:09.480 --> 26:11.600\n Sure, so start from the beginning.\n\n26:11.600 --> 26:14.280\n A spacesuit is the world's smallest spacecraft.\n\n26:14.280 --> 26:16.460\n So I really, that's the best definition I can give you.\n\n26:16.460 --> 26:18.220\n Right now we fly gas pressurized suits,\n\n26:18.220 --> 26:22.220\n but think of developing and designing an entire spacecraft.\n\n26:22.220 --> 26:23.760\n So then you take all those systems\n\n26:23.760 --> 26:25.580\n and you shrink them around a person,\n\n26:25.580 --> 26:27.040\n provide them with oxygen to breathe,\n\n26:27.040 --> 26:29.080\n scrub out their carbon dioxide,\n\n26:29.080 --> 26:30.100\n you know, make sure they have pressure.\n\n26:30.100 --> 26:31.680\n They need a pressure environment to live in.\n\n26:31.680 --> 26:34.980\n So really the spacesuit is a shrunken,\n\n26:34.980 --> 26:37.000\n you know, spacecraft in its entirety,\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:37.840\n has all the same systems.\n\n26:37.840 --> 26:39.080\n Communication as well, probably.\n\n26:39.080 --> 26:41.400\n Yeah, communications, exactly.\n\n26:41.400 --> 26:44.040\n So you really, thermal control,\n\n26:44.040 --> 26:45.920\n little bit of radiation, not so much radiation protection,\n\n26:45.920 --> 26:47.960\n but thermal control, humidity, you know, oxygen debris.\n\n26:47.960 --> 26:49.700\n So all those life support systems,\n\n26:49.700 --> 26:51.600\n as well as the pressure protection.\n\n26:51.600 --> 26:53.480\n So it's an engineering marvel, you know,\n\n26:53.480 --> 26:54.520\n the spacesuits that have flown\n\n26:54.520 --> 26:56.400\n because they really are entire spacecraft,\n\n26:56.400 --> 26:59.040\n they're the small spacecraft that we have around a person,\n\n26:59.040 --> 27:00.720\n but they're very massive,\n\n27:00.720 --> 27:02.960\n but 140 kilos is the current suit,\n\n27:02.960 --> 27:04.360\n and they're not mobility suits.\n\n27:04.360 --> 27:06.020\n So since we're going back to the moon and Mars,\n\n27:06.020 --> 27:08.480\n we need a planetary suit, we need a mobility suit.\n\n27:08.480 --> 27:11.640\n So that's where we've kind of flipped the design paradigm.\n\n27:11.640 --> 27:14.600\n I study astronauts, I study humans in motion,\n\n27:14.600 --> 27:16.240\n and if we can map that motion,\n\n27:16.240 --> 27:17.600\n I want to give you full flexibility,\n\n27:17.600 --> 27:19.120\n you know, move your arms and legs.\n\n27:19.120 --> 27:21.640\n I really want you to be like a Olympic athlete,\n\n27:21.640 --> 27:23.460\n an extreme explorer.\n\n27:23.460 --> 27:25.220\n I don't want to waste any of your energy,\n\n27:25.220 --> 27:27.100\n so we take it from the human design.\n\n27:27.100 --> 27:30.000\n So I take a look at humans, we measure them, we model them,\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:33.000\n and then I say, okay, can I put a spacesuit on them\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:34.160\n that goes from the skin out?\n\n27:34.160 --> 27:36.420\n So rather than a gas pressurized shrinking\n\n27:36.420 --> 27:38.760\n that spacecraft around the person,\n\n27:38.760 --> 27:40.400\n say, here's how humans perform,\n\n27:40.400 --> 27:42.960\n can I design a spacesuit literally from the skin out?\n\n27:42.960 --> 27:44.480\n And that's what we've come up with,\n\n27:44.480 --> 27:46.400\n a mechanical counter pressure, some patterning,\n\n27:46.400 --> 27:49.320\n and that way it could be order of magnitude less\n\n27:49.320 --> 27:51.020\n in terms of the mass,\n\n27:51.020 --> 27:54.560\n and it should provide maximum mobility for moon or Mars.\n\n27:54.560 --> 27:56.120\n What's mechanical counter pressure?\n\n27:56.120 --> 27:58.920\n Like how the heck can you even begin\n\n27:58.920 --> 28:01.480\n to create something that's tight fitting\n\n28:02.480 --> 28:05.040\n and still doesn't protect you from the elements and so on\n\n28:05.040 --> 28:06.880\n and the whole, the pressure thing?\n\n28:06.880 --> 28:08.640\n That's the challenge, it's a big design challenge\n\n28:08.640 --> 28:09.780\n we've been working on it for.\n\n28:09.780 --> 28:11.360\n So you can either put someone in a balloon,\n\n28:11.360 --> 28:12.840\n that's one way to do it, that's conventional,\n\n28:12.840 --> 28:13.680\n that's the only thing we've ever formed.\n\n28:13.680 --> 28:14.520\n What's that mean?\n\n28:14.520 --> 28:15.340\n That means the balloon that you fill with gas?\n\n28:15.340 --> 28:16.180\n That's a gas pressurized suit.\n\n28:16.180 --> 28:17.020\n If you put someone in a balloon,\n\n28:17.020 --> 28:18.960\n it's only a third of an atmosphere\n\n28:18.960 --> 28:19.800\n to keep someone alive.\n\n28:19.800 --> 28:20.760\n So that's what the current system is.\n\n28:20.760 --> 28:22.360\n So depending on what units you think,\n\n28:22.360 --> 28:25.240\n in 30 kilopascals, 4.3 pounds per square inch.\n\n28:25.240 --> 28:28.160\n So much less than the pressure that's on Earth.\n\n28:28.160 --> 28:31.720\n You can still keep a human alive with 0.3\n\n28:31.720 --> 28:33.520\n and it's alive and happy.\n\n28:33.520 --> 28:34.360\n Alive and happy.\n\n28:34.360 --> 28:35.760\n And you mix the gases.\n\n28:35.760 --> 28:37.720\n June, we're having this chat\n\n28:37.720 --> 28:41.520\n and we're at one sea level in Boston, one atmosphere.\n\n28:41.520 --> 28:43.400\n But a suit. Oxygen and nitrogen.\n\n28:43.400 --> 28:44.240\n Oxygen and nitrogen.\n\n28:44.240 --> 28:46.720\n And you put a suit, if we put someone to a third\n\n28:46.720 --> 28:49.480\n of an atmosphere, so for mechanical counter pressure now,\n\n28:49.480 --> 28:51.400\n so one way is to do it with a balloon.\n\n28:51.400 --> 28:52.840\n And that's what we currently have.\n\n28:52.840 --> 28:55.080\n Or you can apply the pressure directly to the skin.\n\n28:55.080 --> 28:58.640\n I only have to give you a third of an atmosphere.\n\n28:58.640 --> 29:00.520\n Right now, you and I are very happy in one atmosphere.\n\n29:00.520 --> 29:04.480\n So if I put that pressure, a third of an atmosphere on you,\n\n29:04.480 --> 29:06.520\n I just have to do it consistently,\n\n29:06.520 --> 29:08.560\n across all of your body and your limbs.\n\n29:08.560 --> 29:10.760\n And it'll be a gas pressurized helmet.\n\n29:10.760 --> 29:13.200\n Doesn't make sense to shrink wrap the head.\n\n29:13.200 --> 29:15.800\n See the blue mangrove, that's a great, it's a great act.\n\n29:15.800 --> 29:17.640\n But we don't need to, there's no benefits\n\n29:17.640 --> 29:19.040\n of like shrink wrapping the head.\n\n29:19.040 --> 29:21.120\n You put, you know, a gas pressurized helmet\n\n29:21.120 --> 29:23.360\n because the helmet then, the future of suits,\n\n29:23.360 --> 29:25.040\n you asked me about, the helmet just becomes\n\n29:25.040 --> 29:26.660\n your information portal.\n\n29:26.660 --> 29:28.440\n So it will have augmented reality.\n\n29:28.440 --> 29:30.380\n It'll have all the information you need.\n\n29:30.380 --> 29:32.080\n Should have, you know, the maps that I need.\n\n29:32.080 --> 29:33.000\n I'm on the moon.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:34.760\n Okay, well, hey, smart helmet.\n\n29:34.760 --> 29:36.920\n Then show me the map, show me the topography.\n\n29:36.920 --> 29:38.600\n Hopefully it has the lab embedded too.\n\n29:38.600 --> 29:40.200\n If it has really great cameras,\n\n29:40.200 --> 29:41.600\n maybe I can see with that regolith.\n\n29:41.600 --> 29:43.080\n That's just lunar dust and dirt.\n\n29:43.080 --> 29:44.160\n What's that made out of?\n\n29:44.160 --> 29:45.480\n We talked about the water.\n\n29:45.480 --> 29:48.520\n So the helmet then really becomes this information portal\n\n29:48.520 --> 29:51.780\n is how I see kind of the IT architecture of the helmet\n\n29:51.780 --> 29:54.700\n is really allowing me to, you know,\n\n29:54.700 --> 29:58.520\n use all of my modalities of an explorer that I'd like to.\n\n29:58.520 --> 30:01.820\n So cameras, voiceover, images, if it were really good,\n\n30:01.820 --> 30:05.240\n it would kind of be, would have lab capabilities as well.\n\n30:05.240 --> 30:07.200\n Okay, so the pressure comes from the body,\n\n30:07.200 --> 30:09.240\n comes from the mechanical pressure.\n\n30:09.240 --> 30:10.480\n It's fascinating.\n\n30:10.480 --> 30:12.880\n Now, what aspect, when I look at Biosuit,\n\n30:12.880 --> 30:14.480\n just the suits you're working on,\n\n30:14.480 --> 30:17.660\n sort of from a fashion perspective, they look awesome.\n\n30:17.660 --> 30:20.720\n Is that a small part of it too?\n\n30:20.720 --> 30:23.440\n Oh, absolutely, because the teams that we work with,\n\n30:23.440 --> 30:25.480\n of course, I'm an engineer, there's engineering students,\n\n30:25.480 --> 30:27.260\n there's design students, there's architects.\n\n30:27.260 --> 30:29.800\n So it really is a very much a multidisciplinary team.\n\n30:29.800 --> 30:33.440\n So sure, colors, aesthetics, materials,\n\n30:33.440 --> 30:34.920\n all those things we pay attention to.\n\n30:34.920 --> 30:36.920\n So it's not just an engineering solution.\n\n30:36.920 --> 30:39.920\n It really is a much more holistic, it's a suit.\n\n30:39.920 --> 30:41.360\n It's a suit, you're, you know,\n\n30:41.360 --> 30:42.200\n you're dressed in a suit now.\n\n30:42.200 --> 30:43.720\n It's a warm fitting.\n\n30:43.720 --> 30:46.280\n So we really have to pay attention to all those things.\n\n30:46.280 --> 30:49.480\n And so that's the design team that we work with.\n\n30:49.480 --> 30:50.760\n And my partner, Geetraati, you know,\n\n30:50.760 --> 30:52.680\n we're partners in this in terms of,\n\n30:52.680 --> 30:56.080\n he comes from an architecture, industrial design background.\n\n30:56.080 --> 30:58.120\n So bringing those skills to bear as well.\n\n30:58.120 --> 31:01.120\n We team up with industry folks who are in, you know,\n\n31:01.120 --> 31:03.000\n athletic performance and designers.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:04.480\n So it really is a team\n\n31:04.480 --> 31:06.280\n that brings all those skills together.\n\n31:06.280 --> 31:08.960\n So what role does this space suit play\n\n31:08.960 --> 31:11.320\n in our longterm staying in Mars,\n\n31:11.320 --> 31:13.240\n sort of exploring the,\n\n31:13.240 --> 31:14.640\n doing all the work that astronauts do,\n\n31:14.640 --> 31:17.440\n but also perhaps civilians one day,\n\n31:17.440 --> 31:20.120\n almost like taking steps towards colonization of Mars?\n\n31:20.120 --> 31:21.760\n What role does a space suit play there?\n\n31:21.760 --> 31:25.440\n So you always need life support system, pressurized habitat.\n\n31:25.440 --> 31:28.440\n And I like to say, we're not going to Mars to sit around.\n\n31:28.440 --> 31:29.960\n So you need a suit.\n\n31:29.960 --> 31:32.160\n You know, even if you land and have the lander,\n\n31:32.160 --> 31:33.720\n you're not going there to stay inside.\n\n31:33.720 --> 31:34.560\n That's for darn sure.\n\n31:34.560 --> 31:36.200\n We're going there to search for the evidence of life.\n\n31:36.200 --> 31:37.400\n That's why we're going to Mars.\n\n31:37.400 --> 31:39.080\n So you need a lot of mobility.\n\n31:39.080 --> 31:41.400\n So for me, the suit is the best way\n\n31:41.400 --> 31:42.920\n to give the human mobility.\n\n31:42.920 --> 31:44.560\n We're always still going to need rovers.\n\n31:44.560 --> 31:45.720\n We're going to need robots.\n\n31:45.720 --> 31:49.440\n So for me, exploration is always a suite of explorers.\n\n31:49.440 --> 31:50.280\n Some people are going to,\n\n31:50.280 --> 31:51.840\n some of the suite of explorers are humans,\n\n31:51.840 --> 31:55.040\n but many are going to be robots, smart systems,\n\n31:55.040 --> 31:55.880\n things like that.\n\n31:55.880 --> 31:58.480\n But I look at it as kind of all those capabilities together\n\n31:58.480 --> 32:00.160\n make the best exploration team.\n\n32:01.080 --> 32:03.800\n So let me ask, I love artificial intelligence\n\n32:03.800 --> 32:07.640\n and I've also saw that you've enjoyed the movie\n\n32:07.640 --> 32:10.120\n Space Odyssey, 2001 Space Odyssey.\n\n32:10.120 --> 32:12.520\n Let me ask the question about HAL 9000.\n\n32:12.520 --> 32:14.080\n That makes a few decisions there\n\n32:14.080 --> 32:17.440\n that prioritizes the mission over the astronauts.\n\n32:17.440 --> 32:20.360\n Do you think, from a high philosophical question,\n\n32:20.360 --> 32:22.760\n do you think HAL did the right thing\n\n32:22.760 --> 32:24.720\n of prioritizing the mission?\n\n32:24.720 --> 32:26.840\n I think our artificial intelligence\n\n32:26.840 --> 32:28.760\n will be smarter in the future.\n\n32:28.760 --> 32:30.240\n For a Mars mission, it's a great question\n\n32:30.240 --> 32:32.680\n that the reality is for a Mars mission,\n\n32:32.680 --> 32:34.400\n we need fully autonomous systems.\n\n32:34.400 --> 32:37.720\n We will get humans, but they have to be fully autonomous.\n\n32:37.720 --> 32:38.760\n And that's a really important,\n\n32:38.760 --> 32:41.040\n that's the most important concept\n\n32:41.040 --> 32:45.040\n because there's not going to be a mission control on Earth.\n\n32:45.040 --> 32:47.680\n 20 minute time lag,\n\n32:47.680 --> 32:48.920\n there's just no way you're going to control it.\n\n32:48.920 --> 32:49.960\n So fully autonomous,\n\n32:49.960 --> 32:51.720\n so people have to be fully autonomous as well,\n\n32:51.720 --> 32:53.280\n but all of our systems as well.\n\n32:53.280 --> 32:55.440\n And so that's the big design challenge.\n\n32:55.440 --> 32:57.360\n So that's why we test them out on the moon as well.\n\n32:57.360 --> 32:59.000\n When we have a, okay, a few second,\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:00.840\n three second time lag, you can test them out.\n\n33:00.840 --> 33:05.360\n We have to really get autonomous exploration down.\n\n33:05.360 --> 33:06.920\n You asked me earlier about Magellan.\n\n33:06.920 --> 33:09.120\n Magellan and his crew, they left, right?\n\n33:09.120 --> 33:11.200\n They were autonomous.\n\n33:11.200 --> 33:12.200\n You know, they were autonomous.\n\n33:12.200 --> 33:14.000\n They left and they were on their own\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:15.080\n to figure out that mission.\n\n33:15.080 --> 33:16.920\n Then when they hit land, they have resources,\n\n33:16.920 --> 33:19.000\n that's in situ resource utilization\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.040\n and everything else they brought with them.\n\n33:21.040 --> 33:23.280\n So we have to, I think, have that mindset for exploration.\n\n33:23.280 --> 33:25.280\n Again, back to the moon, it's more the testing ground,\n\n33:25.280 --> 33:27.240\n the proving ground with technologies.\n\n33:27.240 --> 33:29.600\n But when we get to Mars, it's so far away\n\n33:29.600 --> 33:31.600\n that we need fully autonomous systems.\n\n33:31.600 --> 33:35.360\n So I think that's where, again, AI and autonomy come in,\n\n33:35.360 --> 33:36.680\n a really robust autonomy,\n\n33:36.680 --> 33:38.480\n things that we don't have today yet.\n\n33:38.480 --> 33:39.880\n So they're on the drawing boards,\n\n33:39.880 --> 33:41.320\n but we really need to test them out\n\n33:41.320 --> 33:43.280\n because that's what we're up against.\n\n33:43.280 --> 33:45.760\n So fully autonomous meaning like self sufficient.\n\n33:45.760 --> 33:48.320\n There's still a role for the human in that picture.\n\n33:48.320 --> 33:52.440\n Do you think there'll be a time when AI systems,\n\n33:52.440 --> 33:55.360\n beyond doing fully autonomous flight control\n\n33:55.360 --> 33:58.840\n will also help or even take mission decisions\n\n33:58.840 --> 33:59.800\n like Hal did?\n\n33:59.800 --> 34:00.640\n That's interesting.\n\n34:00.640 --> 34:01.480\n It depends.\n\n34:01.480 --> 34:02.680\n I mean, they're gonna be designed by humans.\n\n34:02.680 --> 34:04.560\n I think as you mentioned, humans are always in the loop.\n\n34:04.560 --> 34:05.560\n I mean, we might be on Earth,\n\n34:05.560 --> 34:06.880\n we might be in orbit on Mars,\n\n34:06.880 --> 34:10.040\n maybe the systems of landers down on the surface of Mars.\n\n34:10.040 --> 34:12.320\n But I think we're gonna get,\n\n34:12.320 --> 34:14.920\n we are right now just on Earth based systems,\n\n34:14.920 --> 34:18.520\n AI systems that are incredibly capable\n\n34:18.520 --> 34:22.680\n and training them with all the data that we have now,\n\n34:22.680 --> 34:24.720\n petabytes of data from Earth.\n\n34:24.720 --> 34:27.240\n What I care about for the autonomy and AI right now,\n\n34:27.240 --> 34:29.000\n how we're applying it in research\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.120\n is to look at Earth and look at climate systems.\n\n34:31.120 --> 34:33.440\n I mean, that's the, it's not for Mars to me today.\n\n34:33.440 --> 34:35.480\n Right now AI is to eyes on Earth,\n\n34:35.480 --> 34:39.600\n all of our space data, compiling that using supercomputers\n\n34:39.600 --> 34:41.880\n because we have so much information and knowledge\n\n34:41.880 --> 34:43.600\n and we need to get that into people's hands.\n\n34:43.600 --> 34:46.080\n First, there's the educational issue with climate\n\n34:46.080 --> 34:47.480\n and our changing climate.\n\n34:47.480 --> 34:49.840\n Then we need to change human behavior.\n\n34:49.840 --> 34:50.680\n That's the biggie.\n\n34:50.680 --> 34:52.960\n So this next decade, it's urgent\n\n34:52.960 --> 34:55.600\n we take care of our own spaceship, which is spaceship Earth.\n\n34:55.600 --> 35:00.320\n So that's to me where my focus has been for AI systems,\n\n35:00.320 --> 35:02.120\n using whatever's out there,\n\n35:02.120 --> 35:05.360\n kind of imagining also what the future situation is,\n\n35:05.360 --> 35:07.760\n what's the satellite imagery of Earth of the future.\n\n35:07.760 --> 35:09.480\n If you can hold that in your hands,\n\n35:09.480 --> 35:10.680\n that's gonna be really powerful.\n\n35:10.680 --> 35:14.160\n Will that help people accelerate positive change for Earth\n\n35:14.160 --> 35:15.600\n and for us to live in balance with Earth?\n\n35:15.600 --> 35:16.440\n I hope so.\n\n35:16.440 --> 35:17.920\n And kind of start with the ocean systems.\n\n35:17.920 --> 35:20.440\n So oceans to land to air and kind of using\n\n35:20.440 --> 35:21.320\n all the space data.\n\n35:21.320 --> 35:24.080\n So it's a huge role for artificial intelligence\n\n35:24.080 --> 35:27.160\n to help us analyze, I call it curating the data,\n\n35:27.160 --> 35:28.400\n using the data.\n\n35:28.400 --> 35:31.000\n It has a lot to do with visualizations as well.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:34.200\n Do you think in a weird, dark question,\n\n35:34.200 --> 35:36.880\n do you think human species can survive\n\n35:36.880 --> 35:39.160\n if we don't become interplanetary\n\n35:39.160 --> 35:43.440\n in the next century or a couple of centuries?\n\n35:44.400 --> 35:45.880\n Absolutely we can survive.\n\n35:45.880 --> 35:48.400\n I don't think Mars is option B actually.\n\n35:48.400 --> 35:51.160\n So I think it's all about saving spaceship Earth\n\n35:51.160 --> 35:52.280\n and humanity.\n\n35:52.280 --> 35:55.200\n I simply put, Earth doesn't need us,\n\n35:55.200 --> 35:57.000\n but we really need Earth.\n\n35:57.000 --> 36:00.000\n All of humanity needs to live in balance with Earth\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:01.240\n because Earth has been here a long time\n\n36:01.240 --> 36:02.120\n before we ever showed up\n\n36:02.120 --> 36:03.920\n and it'll be here a long time after.\n\n36:03.920 --> 36:06.040\n It's just a matter of how do we wanna live\n\n36:06.040 --> 36:09.240\n with all living beings, much more in balance\n\n36:09.240 --> 36:11.240\n because we need to take care of the Earth\n\n36:11.240 --> 36:12.760\n and right now we're not.\n\n36:12.760 --> 36:14.000\n So that's the urgency.\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:15.760\n And I think it is the next decade\n\n36:15.760 --> 36:18.640\n to try to live much more sustainably,\n\n36:18.640 --> 36:19.960\n live more in balance with Earth.\n\n36:19.960 --> 36:23.280\n I think the human species has a great long optimistic future,\n\n36:23.280 --> 36:24.760\n but we have to act.\n\n36:24.760 --> 36:25.600\n It's urgent.\n\n36:25.600 --> 36:27.280\n We have to change behavior.\n\n36:27.280 --> 36:30.280\n We have to realize that we're all in this together.\n\n36:30.280 --> 36:31.840\n It's just one blue bubble.\n\n36:31.840 --> 36:33.200\n It's for humanity.\n\n36:33.200 --> 36:35.960\n So when I think people realize that we're all astronauts,\n\n36:35.960 --> 36:38.600\n that's the great news is everyone's gonna be an astronaut.\n\n36:38.600 --> 36:41.200\n We're all astronauts of spaceship Earth.\n\n36:41.200 --> 36:42.520\n And again, this is our mission.\n\n36:42.520 --> 36:45.120\n This is our mission to take care of the planet.\n\n36:45.120 --> 36:50.120\n And yet as we explore out from our spaceship Earth here\n\n36:50.160 --> 36:52.320\n out into the space,\n\n36:52.320 --> 36:55.240\n what do you think the next 50, 100, 200 years\n\n36:55.240 --> 36:56.920\n look like for space exploration?\n\n36:56.920 --> 36:58.680\n I'm optimistic.\n\n36:58.680 --> 37:01.880\n So I think that we'll have lots of people,\n\n37:01.880 --> 37:03.480\n thousands of people, tens of thousands of people,\n\n37:03.480 --> 37:05.200\n who knows, maybe millions in low Earth orbit.\n\n37:05.200 --> 37:06.960\n That's just a place that we're gonna have people\n\n37:06.960 --> 37:11.280\n and actually some industry, manufacturing, things like that.\n\n37:11.280 --> 37:13.560\n That dream I hope we realize, getting people to the moon.\n\n37:13.560 --> 37:15.920\n So I can envision a lot of people on the moon.\n\n37:15.920 --> 37:17.160\n Again, it's a great place to go.\n\n37:17.160 --> 37:18.960\n Living or visiting?\n\n37:18.960 --> 37:21.160\n Probably visiting and living.\n\n37:21.160 --> 37:22.960\n If you want to, most people are gonna wanna come back\n\n37:22.960 --> 37:23.880\n to Earth, I think.\n\n37:23.880 --> 37:26.200\n But there'll be some people and it's not such a long,\n\n37:26.200 --> 37:28.040\n it's a good view, it's a beautiful view.\n\n37:28.040 --> 37:30.720\n So I think that we will have many people\n\n37:30.720 --> 37:31.560\n on the moon as well.\n\n37:31.560 --> 37:33.880\n I think there'll be some people, you told me, wow,\n\n37:33.880 --> 37:34.880\n hundreds of years out.\n\n37:34.880 --> 37:37.360\n So we'll have people, we'll be interplanetary for sure\n\n37:37.360 --> 37:38.640\n as a species.\n\n37:38.640 --> 37:39.840\n So I think we'll be on the moon.\n\n37:39.840 --> 37:41.640\n I think we'll be on Mars.\n\n37:41.640 --> 37:43.760\n Venus, no, it's already a runaway greenhouse gas.\n\n37:43.760 --> 37:46.120\n So not a great place for science.\n\n37:46.120 --> 37:47.880\n Jupiter, all within the solar system,\n\n37:47.880 --> 37:50.080\n great place for all of our scientific probes.\n\n37:50.080 --> 37:53.280\n I don't see so much in terms of human physical presence.\n\n37:53.280 --> 37:54.200\n We'll be exploring them.\n\n37:54.200 --> 37:57.560\n So we live in our minds there because we're exploring them\n\n37:57.560 --> 37:59.240\n and going on those journeys.\n\n37:59.240 --> 38:03.960\n But it's really our choice in terms of our decisions\n\n38:03.960 --> 38:07.280\n of how in balance we're gonna be living here on the Earth.\n\n38:07.280 --> 38:11.760\n When do you think the first woman, first person will step on Mars?\n\n38:11.760 --> 38:12.600\n Ah, step on Mars?\n\n38:12.600 --> 38:14.520\n Well, I'm gonna do everything I can\n\n38:14.520 --> 38:16.360\n to make sure it happens in the 2030s.\n\n38:16.360 --> 38:17.200\n 2030s.\n\n38:17.200 --> 38:22.200\n Say mid, 20, mid 20, 2025, 2035, we'll be on the moon.\n\n38:22.880 --> 38:24.280\n And hopefully with more people than us.\n\n38:24.280 --> 38:25.760\n But first with a few astronauts,\n\n38:25.760 --> 38:27.640\n it'll be global, international folks.\n\n38:27.640 --> 38:29.920\n But we really need those 10 years, I think, on the moon.\n\n38:29.920 --> 38:33.520\n And then so by later in the decade, in the 2030s,\n\n38:33.520 --> 38:35.400\n we'll have all the technology and know how,\n\n38:35.400 --> 38:38.400\n and we need to get that human mission to Mars done.\n\n38:38.400 --> 38:39.760\n We live in exciting times.\n\n38:39.760 --> 38:41.800\n And, Dava, thank you so much for leading the way\n\n38:41.800 --> 38:42.800\n and thank you for talking today.\n\n38:42.800 --> 38:45.200\n I really appreciate it. Thank you, my pleasure.\n\n38:45.200 --> 38:47.000\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:50.400\n and thank you to our presenting sponsor, Cash App.\n\n38:50.400 --> 38:53.240\n Remember to use code LexPodcast\n\n38:53.240 --> 38:54.320\n when you download Cash App\n\n38:54.320 --> 38:56.400\n from the App Store or Google Play Store.\n\n38:56.400 --> 39:00.600\n You'll get 10 bucks, $10, and $10 will go to FIRST,\n\n39:00.600 --> 39:03.720\n a STEM education nonprofit that inspires hundreds\n\n39:03.720 --> 39:06.880\n of thousands of young minds to learn\n\n39:06.880 --> 39:09.960\n and to dream of engineering our future.\n\n39:09.960 --> 39:34.160\n Thank you and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
