electronics,\n\n00:05.760 --> 00:08.920\n we are fundamentally different from previous,\n\n00:08.920 --> 00:09.840\n from homo sapiens.\n\n00:09.840 --> 00:11.080\n I call us homo techno.\n\n00:11.080 --> 00:13.240\n I think we have evolved into homo techno,\n\n00:13.240 --> 00:15.800\n which is like essentially a new species.\n\n00:15.800 --> 00:17.840\n Previous technologies, I mean,\n\n00:17.840 --> 00:19.120\n may have even been more profound\n\n00:19.120 --> 00:20.180\n and moved us to a certain degree,\n\n00:20.180 --> 00:22.780\n but I think the computers are what make us homo techno.\n\n00:22.780 --> 00:25.600\n I think this is what, it's a brain augmentation.\n\n00:25.600 --> 00:27.860\n So it like allows for actual evolution.\n\n00:27.860 --> 00:29.480\n Like the computers accelerate the degree\n\n00:29.480 --> 00:32.680\n to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated.\n\n00:32.680 --> 00:35.600\n Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno?\n\n00:35.600 --> 00:37.080\n Definitely homo techno.\n\n00:37.080 --> 00:40.960\n So you're one of the earliest of the species.\n\n00:40.960 --> 00:43.060\n I think most of us are.\n\n00:45.400 --> 00:47.760\n The following is a conversation with Grimes,\n\n00:47.760 --> 00:50.520\n an artist, musician, songwriter, producer, director,\n\n00:50.520 --> 00:53.040\n and a fascinating human being\n\n00:53.040 --> 00:55.480\n who thinks a lot about both the history\n\n00:55.480 --> 00:57.520\n and the future of human civilization.\n\n00:57.520 --> 00:59.800\n Studying the dark periods of our past\n\n00:59.800 --> 01:03.880\n to help form an optimistic vision of our future.\n\n01:03.880 --> 01:05.720\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:05.720 --> 01:07.840\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:07.840 --> 01:08.960\n in the description.\n\n01:08.960 --> 01:11.920\n And now, dear friends, here's Grimes.\n\n01:12.840 --> 01:14.480\n Oh yeah, the cloud lifter, there you go.\n\n01:14.480 --> 01:15.300\n There you go.\n\n01:15.300 --> 01:16.440\n You know your stuff.\n\n01:16.440 --> 01:18.240\n Have you ever used a cloud lifter?\n\n01:18.240 --> 01:20.980\n Yeah, I actually, this microphone cloud lifter\n\n01:20.980 --> 01:23.440\n is what Michael Jackson used, so.\n\n01:23.440 --> 01:24.420\n No, really?\n\n01:24.420 --> 01:26.000\n Yeah, this is like Thriller and stuff.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:28.160\n This mic and a cloud lifter?\n\n01:28.160 --> 01:30.620\n Yeah, it's a incredible microphone.\n\n01:30.620 --> 01:32.040\n It's very flattering on vocals.\n\n01:32.040 --> 01:33.600\n I've used this a lot.\n\n01:33.600 --> 01:34.720\n It's great for demo vocals.\n\n01:34.720 --> 01:36.640\n It's great in a room.\n\n01:36.640 --> 01:38.280\n Sometimes it's easier to record vocals\n\n01:38.280 --> 01:40.600\n if you're just in a room and the music's playing\n\n01:40.600 --> 01:43.040\n and you just wanna feel it so it's not in the headphones.\n\n01:43.040 --> 01:44.700\n And this mic is pretty directional,\n\n01:44.700 --> 01:47.740\n so I think it's a good mic for just vibing out\n\n01:47.740 --> 01:49.840\n and just getting a real good vocal take.\n\n01:49.840 --> 01:51.860\n Just vibing, just in a room.\n\n01:51.860 --> 01:55.920\n Anyway, this is the Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones\n\n01:55.920 --> 01:57.000\n microphone.\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:58.800\n I feel way more badass now.\n\n01:58.800 --> 02:01.760\n All right, you wanna just get into it?\n\n02:01.760 --> 02:03.040\n I guess so.\n\n02:03.040 --> 02:05.720\n All right, one of your names, at least in this space\n\n02:05.720 --> 02:08.320\n and time, is C, like the letter C.\n\n02:08.320 --> 02:11.280\n And you told me that C means a lot of things.\n\n02:11.280 --> 02:12.640\n It's the speed of light.\n\n02:12.640 --> 02:14.700\n It's the render rate of the universe.\n\n02:14.700 --> 02:16.120\n It's yes in Spanish.\n\n02:16.120 --> 02:17.660\n It's the crescent moon.\n\n02:17.660 --> 02:21.140\n And it happens to be my favorite programming language\n\n02:21.140 --> 02:24.140\n because it basically runs the world,\n\n02:24.140 --> 02:28.200\n but it's also powerful, fast, and it's dangerous\n\n02:28.200 --> 02:30.000\n because you can mess things up really bad with it\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:31.160\n because of all the pointers.\n\n02:31.160 --> 02:33.960\n But anyway, which of these associations\n\n02:33.960 --> 02:36.580\n will the name C is the coolest to you?\n\n02:37.760 --> 02:40.700\n I mean, to me, the coolest is the speed of light,\n\n02:40.700 --> 02:42.720\n obviously, or the speed of light.\n\n02:42.720 --> 02:44.400\n When I say render rate of the universe,\n\n02:44.400 --> 02:46.280\n I think I mean the speed of light\n\n02:46.280 --> 02:49.120\n because essentially that's what we're rendering at.\n\n02:49.120 --> 02:52.200\n See, I think we'll know if we're in a simulation\n\n02:52.200 --> 02:53.740\n if the speed of light changes\n\n02:53.740 --> 02:57.280\n because if they can improve their render speed, then.\n\n02:57.280 --> 02:58.480\n Well, it's already pretty good.\n\n02:58.480 --> 03:01.040\n It's already pretty good, but if it improves,\n\n03:01.040 --> 03:03.880\n then we'll know, we can probably be like,\n\n03:03.880 --> 03:05.360\n okay, they've updated or upgraded.\n\n03:05.360 --> 03:06.800\n Well, it's fast enough for us humans\n\n03:06.800 --> 03:10.960\n because it seems immediate.\n\n03:10.960 --> 03:13.360\n There's no delay, there's no latency\n\n03:13.360 --> 03:16.240\n in terms of us humans on Earth interacting with things.\n\n03:16.240 --> 03:20.000\n But if you're like intergalactic species\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:21.440\n operating on a much larger scale,\n\n03:21.440 --> 03:23.840\n then you're gonna start noticing some weird stuff.\n\n03:23.840 --> 03:27.340\n Or if you can operate in like around a black hole,\n\n03:27.340 --> 03:29.680\n then you're gonna start to see some render issues.\n\n03:29.680 --> 03:32.680\n You can't go faster than the speed of light, correct?\n\n03:32.680 --> 03:34.520\n So it really limits our ability\n\n03:34.520 --> 03:36.680\n or one's ability to travel space.\n\n03:36.680 --> 03:38.920\n Theoretically, you can, you have wormholes.\n\n03:38.920 --> 03:41.880\n So there's nothing in general relativity\n\n03:41.880 --> 03:46.880\n that precludes faster than the speed of light travel.\n\n03:48.280 --> 03:49.840\n But it just seems you're gonna have to do\n\n03:49.840 --> 03:54.000\n some really funky stuff with very heavy things\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.080\n that have like weirdnesses,\n\n03:56.080 --> 03:58.600\n that have basically terrors in space time.\n\n03:58.600 --> 03:59.740\n We don't know how to do that.\n\n03:59.740 --> 04:01.860\n Do navigators know how to do it?\n\n04:01.860 --> 04:03.800\n Do navigators? Yeah.\n\n04:03.800 --> 04:07.000\n Folding space, basically making wormholes.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:10.240\n So the name C. Yes.\n\n04:11.880 --> 04:13.140\n Who are you?\n\n04:14.800 --> 04:16.960\n Do you think of yourself as multiple people?\n\n04:16.960 --> 04:18.280\n Are you one person?\n\n04:18.280 --> 04:20.860\n Do you know, like in this morning,\n\n04:20.860 --> 04:23.560\n were you a different person than you are tonight?\n\n04:23.560 --> 04:27.080\n We are, I should say, recording this basically at midnight,\n\n04:27.080 --> 04:29.600\n which is awesome. Yes, thank you so much.\n\n04:29.600 --> 04:31.640\n I think I'm about eight hours late.\n\n04:31.640 --> 04:33.960\n No, you're right on time.\n\n04:33.960 --> 04:34.800\n Good morning.\n\n04:34.800 --> 04:37.200\n This is the beginning of a new day soon.\n\n04:37.200 --> 04:39.480\n Anyway, are you the same person\n\n04:39.480 --> 04:41.680\n you were in the morning and the evening?\n\n04:43.040 --> 04:44.320\n Is there multiple people in there?\n\n04:44.320 --> 04:46.240\n Do you think of yourself as one person?\n\n04:46.240 --> 04:47.480\n Or maybe you have no clue?\n\n04:47.480 --> 04:50.160\n Or are you just a giant mystery to yourself?\n\n04:50.160 --> 04:52.480\n Okay, these are really intense questions, but.\n\n04:52.480 --> 04:53.320\n Let's go, let's go.\n\n04:53.320 --> 04:55.320\n Because I asked this myself, like look in the mirror,\n\n04:55.320 --> 04:56.320\n who are you?\n\n04:56.320 --> 04:57.960\n People tell you to just be yourself,\n\n04:57.960 --> 04:59.240\n but what does that even mean?\n\n04:59.240 --> 05:01.520\n I mean, I think my personality changes\n\n05:01.520 --> 05:02.960\n with everyone I talk to.\n\n05:02.960 --> 05:05.720\n So I have a very inconsistent personality.\n\n05:06.600 --> 05:07.440\n Yeah.\n\n05:07.440 --> 05:08.960\n Person to person, so the interaction,\n\n05:08.960 --> 05:11.480\n your personality materializes.\n\n05:11.480 --> 05:12.320\n Or my mood.\n\n05:12.320 --> 05:16.120\n Like I'll go from being like a megalomaniac\n\n05:16.120 --> 05:19.920\n to being like, you know, just like a total hermit\n\n05:19.920 --> 05:21.400\n who is very shy.\n\n05:21.400 --> 05:24.560\n So some combinatorial combination of your mood\n\n05:24.560 --> 05:26.280\n and the person you're interacting with.\n\n05:26.280 --> 05:28.080\n Yeah, mood and people I'm interacting with.\n\n05:28.080 --> 05:29.720\n But I think everyone's like that.\n\n05:29.720 --> 05:30.880\n Maybe not.\n\n05:30.880 --> 05:32.560\n Well, not everybody acknowledges it\n\n05:32.560 --> 05:34.000\n and able to introspect it.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:35.800\n Who brings out, what kind of person,\n\n05:35.800 --> 05:38.120\n what kind of mood brings out the best in you?\n\n05:38.120 --> 05:39.720\n As an artist and as a human.\n\n05:40.840 --> 05:41.840\n Can you introspect this?\n\n05:41.840 --> 05:45.200\n Like my best friends, like people I can,\n\n05:45.200 --> 05:47.480\n when I'm like super confident\n\n05:47.480 --> 05:50.280\n and I know that they're gonna understand\n\n05:50.280 --> 05:52.160\n everything I'm saying, so like my best friends,\n\n05:52.160 --> 05:55.360\n then when I can start being really funny,\n\n05:55.360 --> 05:57.640\n that's always my like peak mode.\n\n05:57.640 --> 06:00.120\n But it's like, yeah, takes a lot to get there.\n\n06:00.120 --> 06:02.320\n Let's talk about constraints.\n\n06:02.320 --> 06:05.560\n You've talked about constraints and limits.\n\n06:06.960 --> 06:09.560\n Do those help you out as an artist or as a human being?\n\n06:09.560 --> 06:10.760\n Or do they get in the way?\n\n06:10.760 --> 06:11.880\n Do you like the constraints?\n\n06:11.880 --> 06:15.440\n So in creating music, in creating art, in living life,\n\n06:16.760 --> 06:19.560\n do you like the constraints that this world puts on you?\n\n06:21.840 --> 06:24.720\n Or do you hate them?\n\n06:24.720 --> 06:29.720\n If constraints are moving, then you're good, right?\n\n06:29.720 --> 06:32.040\n Like it's like as we are progressing with technology,\n\n06:32.040 --> 06:34.800\n we're changing the constraints of like artistic creation.\n\n06:34.800 --> 06:38.440\n You know, making video and music and stuff\n\n06:38.440 --> 06:39.720\n is getting a lot cheaper.\n\n06:39.720 --> 06:42.080\n There's constantly new technology and new software\n\n06:42.080 --> 06:44.000\n that's making it faster and easier.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.680\n We have so much more freedom than we had in the 70s.\n\n06:46.680 --> 06:48.640\n Like when Michael Jackson, you know,\n\n06:48.640 --> 06:51.440\n when they recorded Thriller with this microphone,\n\n06:51.440 --> 06:54.000\n like they had to use a mixing desk and all this stuff.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:55.600\n And like probably even get in a studio,\n\n06:55.600 --> 06:56.560\n it's probably really expensive\n\n06:56.560 --> 06:57.600\n and you have to be a really good singer\n\n06:57.600 --> 06:59.080\n and you have to know how to use\n\n06:59.080 --> 07:00.520\n like the mixing desk and everything.\n\n07:00.520 --> 07:02.480\n And now I can just, you know,\n\n07:02.480 --> 07:05.240\n make I've made a whole album on this computer.\n\n07:05.240 --> 07:06.760\n I have a lot more freedom,\n\n07:06.760 --> 07:10.280\n but then I'm also constrained in different ways\n\n07:10.280 --> 07:13.720\n because there's like literally millions more artists.\n\n07:13.720 --> 07:15.720\n It's like a much bigger playing field.\n\n07:15.720 --> 07:18.680\n It's just like, I also, I didn't learn music.\n\n07:18.680 --> 07:20.240\n I'm not a natural musician.\n\n07:20.240 --> 07:22.640\n So I don't know anything about actual music.\n\n07:22.640 --> 07:24.800\n I just know about like the computer.\n\n07:24.800 --> 07:29.800\n So I'm really kind of just like messing around\n\n07:30.520 --> 07:33.280\n and like trying things out.\n\n07:33.280 --> 07:35.760\n Well, yeah, I mean, but the nature of music is changing.\n\n07:35.760 --> 07:37.320\n So you're saying you don't know actual music,\n\n07:37.320 --> 07:39.260\n what music is changing.\n\n07:39.260 --> 07:41.920\n Music is becoming, you've talked about this,\n\n07:41.920 --> 07:46.640\n is becoming, it's like merging with technology.\n\n07:46.640 --> 07:47.680\n Yes.\n\n07:47.680 --> 07:51.400\n It's becoming something more than just like\n\n07:51.400 --> 07:53.000\n the notes on a piano.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.960\n It's becoming some weird composition\n\n07:54.960 --> 07:59.440\n that requires engineering skills, programming skills,\n\n07:59.440 --> 08:03.440\n some kind of human robot interaction skills,\n\n08:03.440 --> 08:05.680\n and still some of the same things that Michael Jackson had,\n\n08:05.680 --> 08:08.480\n which is like a good ear for a good sense of taste\n\n08:08.480 --> 08:10.360\n of what's good and not the final thing\n\n08:10.360 --> 08:11.520\n when it's put together.\n\n08:11.520 --> 08:14.920\n Like you're allowed, you're enabled, empowered\n\n08:14.920 --> 08:17.200\n with a laptop to layer stuff,\n\n08:17.200 --> 08:20.280\n to start like layering insane amounts of stuff.\n\n08:20.280 --> 08:22.280\n And it's super easy to do that.\n\n08:22.280 --> 08:25.000\n I do think music production is a really underrated art form.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:26.700\n I feel like people really don't appreciate it.\n\n08:26.700 --> 08:27.960\n When I look at publishing splits,\n\n08:27.960 --> 08:31.160\n the way that people like pay producers and stuff,\n\n08:32.240 --> 08:35.560\n it's super, producers are just deeply underrated.\n\n08:35.560 --> 08:39.160\n Like so many of the songs that are popular right now\n\n08:39.160 --> 08:40.920\n or for the last 20 years,\n\n08:40.920 --> 08:42.240\n like part of the reason they're popular\n\n08:42.240 --> 08:44.000\n is because the production is really interesting\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:45.640\n or really sick or really cool.\n\n08:45.640 --> 08:48.060\n And it's like, I don't think listeners,\n\n08:50.920 --> 08:52.520\n like people just don't really understand\n\n08:52.520 --> 08:54.640\n what music production is.\n\n08:54.640 --> 08:57.680\n It's not, it's sort of like this weird,\n\n08:57.680 --> 08:59.360\n discombobulated art form.\n\n08:59.360 --> 09:01.380\n It's not like a formal, because it's so new,\n\n09:01.380 --> 09:06.380\n there isn't like a formal training path for it.\n\n09:06.880 --> 09:10.200\n It's mostly driven by like autodidacts.\n\n09:10.200 --> 09:11.280\n Like it's like almost everyone I know\n\n09:11.280 --> 09:12.200\n who's good at production,\n\n09:12.200 --> 09:13.760\n like they didn't go to music school or anything.\n\n09:13.760 --> 09:15.080\n They just taught themselves.\n\n09:15.080 --> 09:16.040\n Are they're mostly different?\n\n09:16.040 --> 09:18.400\n Like the music producers, you know,\n\n09:18.400 --> 09:21.320\n is there some commonalities that time together\n\n09:21.320 --> 09:23.580\n or are they all just different kinds of weirdos?\n\n09:23.580 --> 09:25.440\n Cause I just, I just hung out with Rick Rubin.\n\n09:25.440 --> 09:26.280\n I don't know if you've.\n\n09:26.280 --> 09:29.760\n Yeah, I mean, Rick Rubin is like literally\n\n09:29.760 --> 09:31.200\n one of the gods of music production.\n\n09:31.200 --> 09:33.780\n Like he's one of the people who first,\n\n09:33.780 --> 09:36.320\n you know, who like made music production,\n\n09:36.320 --> 09:39.360\n you know, made the production as important\n\n09:39.360 --> 09:41.600\n as the actual lyrics or the notes.\n\n09:41.600 --> 09:43.560\n But the thing he does, which is interesting,\n\n09:43.560 --> 09:45.520\n I don't know if you can speak to that,\n\n09:45.520 --> 09:46.760\n but just hanging out with him,\n\n09:46.760 --> 09:48.520\n he seems to just sit there in silence,\n\n09:48.520 --> 09:50.800\n close his eyes and listen.\n\n09:50.800 --> 09:53.640\n It's like, he almost does nothing.\n\n09:53.640 --> 09:55.880\n And that nothing somehow gives you freedom\n\n09:55.880 --> 09:58.160\n to be the best version of yourself.\n\n09:58.160 --> 10:00.060\n So that's music production somehow too,\n\n10:00.060 --> 10:02.680\n which is like encouraging you to do less,\n\n10:02.680 --> 10:06.900\n to simplify, to like push towards minimalism.\n\n10:06.900 --> 10:08.060\n I mean, I guess, I mean,\n\n10:09.600 --> 10:11.600\n I work differently from Rick Rubin\n\n10:11.600 --> 10:14.160\n cause Rick Rubin produces for other artists,\n\n10:14.160 --> 10:17.080\n whereas like I mostly produce for myself.\n\n10:17.080 --> 10:19.240\n So it's a very different situation.\n\n10:19.240 --> 10:21.760\n I also think Rick Rubin, he's in that,\n\n10:21.760 --> 10:23.600\n I would say advanced category of producer\n\n10:23.600 --> 10:26.600\n where like you've like earned your,\n\n10:26.600 --> 10:27.960\n you can have an engineer and stuff\n\n10:27.960 --> 10:29.840\n and people like do the stuff for you.\n\n10:29.840 --> 10:32.400\n But I usually just like do stuff myself.\n\n10:32.400 --> 10:37.400\n So you're the engineer, the producer and the artist.\n\n10:38.080 --> 10:39.880\n Yeah, I guess I would say I'm in the era,\n\n10:39.880 --> 10:41.280\n like the post Rick Rubin era.\n\n10:41.280 --> 10:43.000\n Like I come from the kind of like\n\n10:44.320 --> 10:47.040\n Skrillex school of thought,\n\n10:47.040 --> 10:49.240\n which is like where you are.\n\n10:49.240 --> 10:51.040\n Yeah, the engineer, producer, artist.\n\n10:51.040 --> 10:53.760\n Like where, I mean lately,\n\n10:53.760 --> 10:55.560\n sometimes I'll work with a producer now.\n\n10:55.560 --> 10:59.120\n I'm gently sort of delicately starting\n\n10:59.120 --> 10:59.960\n to collaborate a bit more,\n\n10:59.960 --> 11:02.800\n but like I think I'm kind of from the,\n\n11:02.800 --> 11:07.120\n like the whatever 2010s explosion of things\n\n11:07.120 --> 11:11.920\n where everything became available on the computer\n\n11:11.920 --> 11:16.680\n and you kind of got this like lone wizard energy thing going.\n\n11:16.680 --> 11:19.680\n So you embraced being the loneliness.\n\n11:19.680 --> 11:22.440\n Is the loneliness somehow an engine of creativity?\n\n11:22.440 --> 11:24.560\n Like, so most of your stuff,\n\n11:24.560 --> 11:28.640\n most of your creative quote unquote genius in quotes\n\n11:28.640 --> 11:32.160\n is in the privacy of your mind.\n\n11:32.160 --> 11:34.780\n Yes, well, it was,\n\n11:36.680 --> 11:39.060\n but here's the thing.\n\n11:39.060 --> 11:40.840\n I was talking to Daniel Eck and he said,\n\n11:40.840 --> 11:43.400\n he's like most artists, they have about 10 years,\n\n11:43.400 --> 11:45.160\n like 10 good years.\n\n11:45.160 --> 11:48.820\n And then they usually stop making their like vital shit.\n\n11:49.880 --> 11:53.360\n And I feel like I'm sort of like nearing the end\n\n11:53.360 --> 11:56.540\n of my 10 years on my own.\n\n11:56.540 --> 11:58.640\n So you have to become somebody else.\n\n11:58.640 --> 11:59.840\n Now I'm like, I'm in the process\n\n11:59.840 --> 12:01.720\n of becoming somebody else and reinventing.\n\n12:01.720 --> 12:02.840\n When I work with other people,\n\n12:02.840 --> 12:04.180\n because I've never worked with other people,\n\n12:04.180 --> 12:08.380\n I find that I make like, that I'm exceptionally rejuvenated\n\n12:08.380 --> 12:10.980\n and making like some of the most vital work I've ever made.\n\n12:10.980 --> 12:13.840\n So, because I think another human brain\n\n12:13.840 --> 12:16.540\n is like one of the best tools you can possibly find.\n\n12:17.560 --> 12:18.400\n Like.\n\n12:18.400 --> 12:20.560\n It's a funny way to put it, I love it.\n\n12:20.560 --> 12:23.340\n It's like if a tool is like, you know,\n\n12:23.340 --> 12:27.320\n whatever HP plus one or like adds some like stats\n\n12:27.320 --> 12:30.760\n to your character, like another human brain\n\n12:30.760 --> 12:34.240\n will like square it instead of just like adding something.\n\n12:34.240 --> 12:36.320\n Double up the experience points, I love this.\n\n12:36.320 --> 12:38.280\n We should also mention we're playing Tavern music\n\n12:38.280 --> 12:41.600\n before this and which I love, which I first,\n\n12:41.600 --> 12:42.440\n I think I first.\n\n12:42.440 --> 12:43.760\n You had to stop the Tavern music.\n\n12:43.760 --> 12:46.380\n Yeah, because it doesn't, the audio.\n\n12:46.380 --> 12:47.220\n Okay, okay.\n\n12:47.220 --> 12:48.040\n But it makes.\n\n12:48.040 --> 12:48.880\n Yeah, it'll make the podcast annoying.\n\n12:48.880 --> 12:50.040\n Add it in post, add it in post.\n\n12:50.040 --> 12:51.560\n No one will want to listen to the podcast.\n\n12:51.560 --> 12:53.400\n They probably would, but it makes me,\n\n12:53.400 --> 12:55.480\n it reminds me like of a video game,\n\n12:55.480 --> 12:56.760\n like a role playing video game\n\n12:56.760 --> 12:58.400\n where you have experience points.\n\n12:58.400 --> 13:03.400\n There's something really joyful about wandering places\n\n13:03.440 --> 13:06.480\n like Elder Scrolls, like Skyrim,\n\n13:06.480 --> 13:10.500\n just exploring these landscapes in another world\n\n13:10.500 --> 13:12.000\n and then you get experience points\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\n and you can work on different skills\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.160\n and somehow you progress in life.\n\n13:16.160 --> 13:17.600\n I don't know, it's simple.\n\n13:17.600 --> 13:19.960\n It doesn't have some of the messy complexities of life\n\n13:19.960 --> 13:23.960\n and there's usually a bad guy you can fight in Skyrim.\n\n13:23.960 --> 13:25.560\n It's dragons and so on.\n\n13:25.560 --> 13:26.460\n I'm sure in Elden Ring,\n\n13:26.460 --> 13:28.240\n there's a bunch of monsters you can fight.\n\n13:28.240 --> 13:29.080\n I love that.\n\n13:29.080 --> 13:29.960\n I feel like Elden Ring,\n\n13:29.960 --> 13:31.440\n I feel like this is a good analogy\n\n13:31.440 --> 13:32.360\n to music production though\n\n13:32.360 --> 13:34.400\n because it's like, I feel like the engineers\n\n13:34.400 --> 13:36.600\n and the people creating these open worlds are,\n\n13:36.600 --> 13:39.660\n it's sort of like similar to people, to music producers\n\n13:39.660 --> 13:42.720\n where it's like this hidden archetype\n\n13:42.720 --> 13:44.600\n that like no one really understands what they do\n\n13:44.600 --> 13:46.160\n and no one really knows who they are,\n\n13:46.160 --> 13:49.300\n but they're like, it's like the artist engineer\n\n13:49.300 --> 13:51.760\n because it's like, it's both art\n\n13:51.760 --> 13:54.840\n and fairly complex engineering.\n\n13:54.840 --> 13:57.200\n Well, you're saying they don't get enough credit.\n\n13:57.200 --> 13:58.600\n Aren't you kind of changing that\n\n13:58.600 --> 14:01.320\n by becoming the person doing everything?\n\n14:01.320 --> 14:03.680\n Aren't you, isn't the engineer?\n\n14:03.680 --> 14:05.440\n Well, I mean, others have gone before me.\n\n14:05.440 --> 14:07.800\n I'm not, you know, there's like Timbaland and Skrillex\n\n14:07.800 --> 14:10.360\n and there's all these people that are like,\n\n14:10.360 --> 14:12.040\n you know, very famous for this,\n\n14:12.040 --> 14:13.920\n but I just think the general,\n\n14:13.920 --> 14:15.920\n I think people get confused about what it is\n\n14:15.920 --> 14:19.200\n and just don't really know what it is per se\n\n14:19.200 --> 14:20.480\n and it's just when I see a song,\n\n14:20.480 --> 14:22.280\n like when there's like a hit song,\n\n14:22.280 --> 14:27.280\n like I'm just trying to think of like,\n\n14:27.520 --> 14:29.860\n just going for like even just a basic pop hit,\n\n14:29.860 --> 14:33.120\n like, what's it?\n\n14:33.120 --> 14:36.100\n Like Rules by Dua Lipa or something.\n\n14:36.100 --> 14:39.220\n The production on that is actually like really crazy.\n\n14:39.220 --> 14:40.560\n I mean, the song is also great,\n\n14:40.560 --> 14:43.360\n but it's like the production is exceptionally memorable.\n\n14:43.360 --> 14:47.200\n Like, you know, and it's just like no one,\n\n14:47.200 --> 14:49.180\n I can't, I don't even know who produced that song.\n\n14:49.180 --> 14:50.680\n It's just like, isn't part of like the rhetoric\n\n14:50.680 --> 14:53.420\n of how we just discuss the creation of art.\n\n14:53.420 --> 14:57.200\n We just sort of like don't consider the music producer\n\n14:57.200 --> 15:00.320\n because I think the music producer used to be more\n\n15:00.320 --> 15:02.500\n just simply recording things.\n\n15:03.700 --> 15:04.640\n Yeah, that's interesting\n\n15:04.640 --> 15:06.000\n because when you think about movies,\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.600\n we talk about the actor and the actresses,\n\n15:08.600 --> 15:11.520\n but we also talk about the directors.\n\n15:11.520 --> 15:14.440\n We don't talk about like that with the music as often.\n\n15:15.760 --> 15:17.360\n The Beatles music producer\n\n15:17.360 --> 15:19.880\n was one of the first kind of guy,\n\n15:19.880 --> 15:21.220\n one of the first people sort of introducing\n\n15:21.220 --> 15:22.640\n crazy sound design into pop music.\n\n15:22.640 --> 15:24.160\n I forget his name.\n\n15:24.160 --> 15:25.860\n He has the same, I forget his name,\n\n15:25.860 --> 15:29.180\n but you know, like he was doing all the weird stuff\n\n15:29.180 --> 15:32.420\n like dropping pianos and like, yeah.\n\n15:32.420 --> 15:33.480\n Oh, to get the, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n\n15:33.480 --> 15:36.580\n to get the sound, to get the authentic sound.\n\n15:36.580 --> 15:38.100\n What about lyrics?\n\n15:38.100 --> 15:40.960\n You think those, where did they fit\n\n15:40.960 --> 15:42.960\n into how important they are?\n\n15:42.960 --> 15:44.860\n I was heartbroken to learn\n\n15:44.860 --> 15:46.800\n that Elvis didn't write his songs.\n\n15:46.800 --> 15:47.880\n I was very mad.\n\n15:47.880 --> 15:49.480\n A lot of people don't write their songs.\n\n15:49.480 --> 15:50.820\n I understand this, but.\n\n15:50.820 --> 15:52.200\n But here's the thing.\n\n15:52.200 --> 15:54.880\n I feel like there's this desire for authenticity.\n\n15:54.880 --> 15:56.140\n I used to be like really mad\n\n15:56.140 --> 15:58.000\n when like people wouldn't write or produce their music\n\n15:58.000 --> 15:59.280\n and I'd be like, that's fake.\n\n15:59.280 --> 16:04.280\n And then I realized there's all this like weird bitterness\n\n16:04.520 --> 16:07.760\n and like agronus in art about authenticity.\n\n16:07.760 --> 16:10.800\n But I had this kind of like weird realization recently\n\n16:12.200 --> 16:14.960\n where I started thinking that like art\n\n16:14.960 --> 16:19.960\n is sort of a decentralized collective thing.\n\n16:20.220 --> 16:25.220\n Like art is kind of a conversation\n\n16:25.300 --> 16:28.560\n with all the artists that have ever lived before you.\n\n16:28.560 --> 16:31.080\n You know, like it's like, you're really just sort of,\n\n16:31.080 --> 16:33.520\n it's not like anyone's reinventing the wheel here.\n\n16:33.520 --> 16:36.620\n Like you're kind of just taking, you know,\n\n16:36.620 --> 16:38.200\n thousands of years of art\n\n16:38.200 --> 16:41.700\n and like running it through your own little algorithm\n\n16:41.700 --> 16:45.040\n and then like making your interpretation of it.\n\n16:45.040 --> 16:46.240\n You just joined the conversation\n\n16:46.240 --> 16:47.560\n with all the other artists that came before.\n\n16:47.560 --> 16:49.580\n It's just a beautiful way to look at it.\n\n16:49.580 --> 16:51.540\n Like, and it's like, I feel like everyone's always like,\n\n16:51.540 --> 16:54.120\n there's all this copyright and IP and this and that\n\n16:54.120 --> 16:55.160\n or authenticity.\n\n16:55.160 --> 16:59.220\n And it's just like, I think we need to stop seeing this\n\n16:59.220 --> 17:01.580\n as this like egotistical thing of like,\n\n17:01.580 --> 17:04.180\n oh, the creative genius, the lone creative genius\n\n17:04.180 --> 17:05.020\n or this or that.\n\n17:05.020 --> 17:08.760\n Because it's like, I think art shouldn't be about that.\n\n17:08.760 --> 17:10.360\n I think art is something that sort of\n\n17:10.360 --> 17:12.040\n brings humanity together.\n\n17:12.040 --> 17:14.080\n And it's also, art is also kind of the collective memory\n\n17:14.080 --> 17:14.920\n of humans.\n\n17:14.920 --> 17:18.720\n It's like, we don't give a fuck about\n\n17:18.720 --> 17:20.280\n whatever ancient Egypt,\n\n17:20.280 --> 17:22.760\n like how much grain got sent that day\n\n17:22.760 --> 17:24.920\n and sending the records and like, you know,\n\n17:24.920 --> 17:27.600\n like who went where and, you know,\n\n17:27.600 --> 17:29.640\n how many shields needed to be produced for this.\n\n17:29.640 --> 17:32.240\n Like we just remember their art.\n\n17:32.240 --> 17:34.840\n And it's like, you know, it's like in our day to day life,\n\n17:34.840 --> 17:38.080\n there's all this stuff that seems more important than art\n\n17:38.080 --> 17:40.200\n because it helps us function and survive.\n\n17:40.200 --> 17:41.840\n But when all this is gone,\n\n17:41.840 --> 17:45.040\n like the only thing that's really gonna be left is the art.\n\n17:45.040 --> 17:46.800\n The technology will be obsolete.\n\n17:46.800 --> 17:47.640\n That's so fascinating.\n\n17:47.640 --> 17:49.080\n Like the humans will be dead.\n\n17:49.080 --> 17:49.920\n That is true.\n\n17:49.920 --> 17:52.520\n A good compression of human history\n\n17:52.520 --> 17:56.200\n is the art we've generated across the different centuries,\n\n17:56.200 --> 17:57.800\n the different millennia.\n\n17:57.800 --> 17:59.900\n So when the aliens come.\n\n17:59.900 --> 18:00.740\n When the aliens come,\n\n18:00.740 --> 18:02.740\n they're gonna find the hieroglyphics and the pyramids.\n\n18:02.740 --> 18:04.360\n I mean, art could be broadly defined.\n\n18:04.360 --> 18:06.240\n They might find like the engineering marvels,\n\n18:06.240 --> 18:09.860\n the bridges, the rockets, the.\n\n18:09.860 --> 18:11.480\n I guess I sort of classify though.\n\n18:11.480 --> 18:13.580\n Architecture is art too.\n\n18:13.580 --> 18:18.580\n I consider engineering in those formats to be art, for sure.\n\n18:19.360 --> 18:23.200\n It sucks that like digital art is easier to delete.\n\n18:23.200 --> 18:25.800\n So if there's an apocalypse, a nuclear war,\n\n18:25.800 --> 18:26.880\n that can disappear.\n\n18:26.880 --> 18:28.080\n Yes.\n\n18:28.080 --> 18:28.920\n And the physical.\n\n18:28.920 --> 18:30.000\n There's something still valuable\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.360\n about the physical manifestation of art.\n\n18:32.360 --> 18:35.580\n That sucks that like music, for example,\n\n18:35.580 --> 18:37.940\n has to be played by somebody.\n\n18:37.940 --> 18:41.640\n Yeah, I do think we should have a foundation type situation\n\n18:41.640 --> 18:44.120\n where we like, you know how we have like seed banks\n\n18:44.120 --> 18:45.520\n up in the north and stuff?\n\n18:45.520 --> 18:48.000\n Like we should probably have like a solar powered\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.760\n or geothermal little bunker\n\n18:49.760 --> 18:52.360\n that like has all human knowledge.\n\n18:52.360 --> 18:54.220\n You mentioned Daniel Ek and Spotify.\n\n18:55.240 --> 18:56.960\n What do you think about that as an artist?\n\n18:56.960 --> 18:58.280\n What's Spotify?\n\n18:58.280 --> 19:00.000\n Is that empowering?\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.560\n To me, Spotify as a consumer is super exciting.\n\n19:02.560 --> 19:04.960\n It makes it easy for me to access music\n\n19:04.960 --> 19:06.600\n from all kinds of artists,\n\n19:06.600 --> 19:08.420\n get to explore all kinds of music,\n\n19:08.420 --> 19:12.280\n make it super easy to sort of curate my own playlist\n\n19:12.280 --> 19:13.960\n and have fun with all that.\n\n19:13.960 --> 19:16.040\n It was so liberating to let go.\n\n19:16.040 --> 19:17.560\n You know, I used to collect, you know,\n\n19:17.560 --> 19:22.120\n albums and CDs and so on, like horde albums.\n\n19:22.120 --> 19:22.960\n Yeah.\n\n19:22.960 --> 19:23.780\n Like they matter.\n\n19:23.780 --> 19:25.640\n But the reality you could, you know,\n\n19:25.640 --> 19:28.080\n that was really liberating that I could let go of that.\n\n19:28.080 --> 19:32.160\n And letting go of the albums you're kind of collecting\n\n19:32.160 --> 19:33.600\n allows you to find new music,\n\n19:33.600 --> 19:36.200\n exploring new artists and all that kind of stuff.\n\n19:36.200 --> 19:38.360\n But I know from a perspective of an artist that could be,\n\n19:38.360 --> 19:39.200\n like you mentioned,\n\n19:39.200 --> 19:42.000\n competition could be a kind of constraint\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.640\n because there's more and more and more artists\n\n19:44.640 --> 19:46.040\n on the platform.\n\n19:46.040 --> 19:47.880\n I think it's better that there's more artists.\n\n19:47.880 --> 19:49.800\n I mean, again, this might be propaganda\n\n19:49.800 --> 19:51.680\n because this is all from a conversation with Daniel Ek.\n\n19:51.680 --> 19:54.040\n So this could easily be propaganda.\n\n19:54.040 --> 19:56.720\n We're all a victim of somebody's propaganda.\n\n19:56.720 --> 19:58.960\n So let's just accept this.\n\n19:58.960 --> 20:01.000\n But Daniel Ek was telling me that, you know,\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.680\n at the, because I, you know, when I met him,\n\n20:03.680 --> 20:06.440\n I came in all furious about Spotify\n\n20:06.440 --> 20:07.760\n and like I grilled him super hard.\n\n20:07.760 --> 20:10.640\n So I've got his answers here.\n\n20:10.640 --> 20:13.520\n But he was saying like at the sort of peak\n\n20:13.520 --> 20:15.240\n of the CD industry,\n\n20:15.240 --> 20:18.280\n there was like 20,000 artists making millions\n\n20:18.280 --> 20:19.520\n and millions of dollars.\n\n20:19.520 --> 20:22.840\n Like there was just like a very tiny kind of 1%.\n\n20:22.840 --> 20:27.400\n And Spotify has kind of democratized the industry\n\n20:27.400 --> 20:30.320\n because now I think he said there's about a million artists\n\n20:30.320 --> 20:33.120\n making a good living from Spotify.\n\n20:33.120 --> 20:35.600\n And when I heard that, I was like, honestly,\n\n20:36.920 --> 20:38.840\n I would rather make less money\n\n20:38.840 --> 20:41.160\n and have just like a decent living\n\n20:43.720 --> 20:46.560\n and have more artists be able to have that,\n\n20:46.560 --> 20:49.320\n even though I like, I wish it could include everyone, but.\n\n20:49.320 --> 20:50.760\n Yeah, that's really hard to argue with.\n\n20:50.760 --> 20:52.280\n YouTube is the same.\n\n20:52.280 --> 20:54.120\n It's YouTube's mission.\n\n20:54.120 --> 20:58.280\n They want to basically have as many creators as possible\n\n20:58.280 --> 21:00.720\n and make a living, some kind of living.\n\n21:00.720 --> 21:02.720\n And that's so hard to argue with.\n\n21:02.720 --> 21:03.560\n It's so hard.\n\n21:03.560 --> 21:04.480\n But I think there's better ways to do it.\n\n21:04.480 --> 21:06.520\n My manager, I actually wish he was here.\n\n21:06.520 --> 21:07.840\n Like I would have brought him up.\n\n21:07.840 --> 21:12.840\n My manager is building an app that can manage you.\n\n21:13.800 --> 21:16.520\n So it'll like help you organize your percentages\n\n21:16.520 --> 21:18.840\n and get your publishing and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.\n\n21:18.840 --> 21:19.960\n So you can take out all the middlemen\n\n21:19.960 --> 21:21.360\n so you can have a much bigger,\n\n21:21.360 --> 21:23.000\n it'll just like automate it.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:23.840\n So you can get.\n\n21:23.840 --> 21:24.680\n So automate the manager?\n\n21:24.680 --> 21:28.040\n Automate management, publishing,\n\n21:28.040 --> 21:32.440\n and legal, it can read,\n\n21:32.440 --> 21:34.080\n the app he's building can read your contract\n\n21:34.080 --> 21:35.640\n and like tell you about it.\n\n21:35.640 --> 21:38.280\n Because one of the issues with music right now,\n\n21:38.280 --> 21:39.800\n it's not that we're not getting paid enough,\n\n21:39.800 --> 21:44.800\n but it's that the art industry is filled with middlemen\n\n21:44.960 --> 21:47.760\n because artists are not good at business.\n\n21:47.760 --> 21:50.400\n And from the beginning, like Frank Sinatra,\n\n21:50.400 --> 21:51.640\n it's all mob stuff.\n\n21:51.640 --> 21:56.640\n Like it's the music industry is run by business people,\n\n21:56.640 --> 21:59.480\n not the artists and the artists really get very small cuts\n\n21:59.480 --> 22:00.400\n of like what they make.\n\n22:00.400 --> 22:04.720\n And so I think part of the reason I'm a technocrat,\n\n22:04.720 --> 22:07.040\n which I mean, your fans are gonna be technocrats.\n\n22:07.040 --> 22:09.240\n So no one's, they're not gonna be mad at me about this,\n\n22:09.240 --> 22:12.160\n but like my fans hate it when I say this kind of thing\n\n22:12.160 --> 22:13.000\n or the general public.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:14.160\n They don't like technocrats.\n\n22:14.160 --> 22:15.600\n They don't like technocrats.\n\n22:15.600 --> 22:18.720\n Like when I watched Battle Angel Alita\n\n22:18.720 --> 22:20.360\n and they were like the Martian technocracy\n\n22:20.360 --> 22:22.000\n and I was like, yeah, Martian technocracy.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:23.520\n And then they were like, and they're evil.\n\n22:23.520 --> 22:25.560\n And I was like, oh, okay.\n\n22:25.560 --> 22:28.760\n I was like, cause Martian technocracy sounds sick to me.\n\n22:28.760 --> 22:31.920\n Yeah, so your intuition as technocrats\n\n22:31.920 --> 22:34.200\n would create some kind of beautiful world.\n\n22:34.200 --> 22:36.040\n For example, what my manager's working on,\n\n22:36.040 --> 22:39.880\n if you can create an app that removes the need for a lawyer\n\n22:39.880 --> 22:43.360\n and then you could have smart contracts on the blockchain,\n\n22:43.360 --> 22:46.800\n removes the need for like management\n\n22:46.800 --> 22:48.000\n and organizing all this stuff,\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.920\n like can read your stuff and explain it to you,\n\n22:50.920 --> 22:54.200\n can collect your royalties, you know,\n\n22:54.200 --> 22:56.960\n like then the small amounts,\n\n22:56.960 --> 22:58.680\n the amount of money that you're getting from Spotify\n\n22:58.680 --> 23:01.760\n actually means a lot more and goes a lot farther.\n\n23:01.760 --> 23:03.120\n It can remove some of the bureaucracy,\n\n23:03.120 --> 23:06.360\n some of the inefficiencies that make life\n\n23:06.360 --> 23:08.200\n not as great as it could be.\n\n23:08.200 --> 23:10.840\n Yeah, I think the issue isn't that there's not enough.\n\n23:10.840 --> 23:12.680\n Like the issue is that there's inefficiency\n\n23:12.680 --> 23:17.560\n and I'm really into this positive sum mindset,\n\n23:18.640 --> 23:20.840\n you know, the win, win mindset of like,\n\n23:20.840 --> 23:23.520\n instead of, you know, fighting over the scraps,\n\n23:23.520 --> 23:26.520\n how do we make the, or worrying about scarcity,\n\n23:26.520 --> 23:27.800\n like instead of a scarcity mindset,\n\n23:27.800 --> 23:30.080\n why don't we just increase the efficiency\n\n23:30.080 --> 23:32.360\n and, you know, in that way.\n\n23:32.360 --> 23:34.400\n Expand the size of the pie.\n\n23:34.400 --> 23:36.560\n Let me ask you about experimentation.\n\n23:36.560 --> 23:38.640\n So you said, which is beautiful,\n\n23:40.480 --> 23:42.760\n being a musician is like having a conversation\n\n23:42.760 --> 23:44.560\n with all those that came before you.\n\n23:45.440 --> 23:48.320\n How much of creating music is like\n\n23:51.200 --> 23:53.040\n kind of having that conversation,\n\n23:53.040 --> 23:57.200\n trying to fit into the cultural trends\n\n23:57.200 --> 23:59.320\n and how much of it is like trying to,\n\n23:59.320 --> 24:00.840\n as much as possible, be an outsider\n\n24:00.840 --> 24:02.600\n and come up with something totally new.\n\n24:02.600 --> 24:04.440\n It's like when you're thinking,\n\n24:04.440 --> 24:05.640\n when you're experimenting,\n\n24:05.640 --> 24:08.680\n are you trying to be totally different, totally weird?\n\n24:08.680 --> 24:12.120\n Are you trying to fit in?\n\n24:12.120 --> 24:14.640\n Man, this is so hard because I feel like I'm\n\n24:14.640 --> 24:16.880\n kind of in the process of semi retiring from music,\n\n24:16.880 --> 24:18.720\n so this is like my old brain.\n\n24:18.720 --> 24:22.040\n Yeah, bring it from like the shelf,\n\n24:22.040 --> 24:24.440\n put it on the table for a couple minutes,\n\n24:24.440 --> 24:26.280\n we'll just poke it.\n\n24:26.280 --> 24:27.240\n I think it's a bit of both\n\n24:27.240 --> 24:31.320\n because I think forcing yourself to engage with new music\n\n24:32.400 --> 24:35.000\n is really great for neuroplasticity.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:38.280\n Like I think, you know, as people,\n\n24:39.480 --> 24:41.640\n part of the reason music is marketed at young people\n\n24:41.640 --> 24:43.360\n is because young people are very neuroplastic.\n\n24:43.360 --> 24:48.200\n So like if you're 16 to like 23 or whatever,\n\n24:48.200 --> 24:50.840\n it's gonna be really easy for you to love new music.\n\n24:50.840 --> 24:52.280\n And if you're older than that,\n\n24:52.280 --> 24:53.760\n it gets harder and harder and harder.\n\n24:53.760 --> 24:54.960\n And I think one of the beautiful things\n\n24:54.960 --> 24:57.880\n about being a musician is I just constantly force myself\n\n24:57.880 --> 24:58.760\n to listen to new music\n\n24:58.760 --> 25:01.000\n and I think it keeps my brain really plastic.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:02.760\n And I think this is a really good exercise.\n\n25:02.760 --> 25:04.280\n I just think everyone should do this.\n\n25:04.280 --> 25:05.600\n You listen to new music and you hate it,\n\n25:05.600 --> 25:08.600\n I think you should just keep, force yourself to like,\n\n25:08.600 --> 25:09.920\n okay, well why do people like it?\n\n25:09.920 --> 25:14.640\n And like, you know, make your brain form new neural pathways\n\n25:14.640 --> 25:16.880\n and be more open to change.\n\n25:16.880 --> 25:18.280\n That's really brilliant actually.\n\n25:18.280 --> 25:21.520\n Sorry to interrupt, but like that exercise\n\n25:21.520 --> 25:26.520\n is really amazing to sort of embrace change,\n\n25:27.480 --> 25:31.600\n embrace sort of practice neuroplasticity.\n\n25:31.600 --> 25:33.160\n Because like that's one of the things,\n\n25:33.160 --> 25:34.360\n you fall in love with a certain band\n\n25:34.360 --> 25:36.760\n and you just kind of stay with that for the rest of your life\n\n25:36.760 --> 25:38.400\n and then you never understand the modern music.\n\n25:38.400 --> 25:39.240\n That's a really good exercise.\n\n25:39.240 --> 25:40.640\n Most of the streaming on Spotify\n\n25:40.640 --> 25:42.440\n is like classic rock and stuff.\n\n25:42.440 --> 25:44.800\n Like new music makes up a very small chunk\n\n25:44.800 --> 25:46.840\n of what is played on Spotify.\n\n25:46.840 --> 25:50.120\n And I think this is like not a good sign for us as a species.\n\n25:50.120 --> 25:52.880\n I think, yeah.\n\n25:52.880 --> 25:57.720\n So it's a good measure of the species open mindedness\n\n25:57.720 --> 26:01.120\n to change is how often you listen to new music.\n\n26:01.120 --> 26:05.160\n The brain, let's put the music brain back on the shelf.\n\n26:05.160 --> 26:08.280\n I gotta pull out the futurist brain for a second.\n\n26:09.680 --> 26:12.280\n In what wild ways do you think the future,\n\n26:12.280 --> 26:14.960\n say in like 30 years, maybe 50 years,\n\n26:14.960 --> 26:16.960\n maybe a hundred years will be different\n\n26:19.280 --> 26:22.120\n from our current way of life on earth?\n\n26:22.120 --> 26:25.400\n We can talk about augmented reality, virtual reality,\n\n26:25.400 --> 26:30.400\n maybe robots, maybe space travel, maybe video games,\n\n26:30.800 --> 26:32.520\n maybe genetic engineering.\n\n26:32.520 --> 26:33.360\n I can keep going.\n\n26:33.360 --> 26:36.240\n Cyborgs, aliens, world wars,\n\n26:36.240 --> 26:39.840\n maybe destructive nuclear wars, good and bad.\n\n26:39.840 --> 26:43.520\n When you think about the future, what are you imagining?\n\n26:43.520 --> 26:45.920\n What's the weirdest and the wildest it could be?\n\n26:47.640 --> 26:50.120\n Have you read Surface Detail by Iain Banks?\n\n26:51.480 --> 26:54.800\n Surface Detail is my favorite depiction of a,\n\n26:54.800 --> 26:56.520\n oh wow, you have to read this book.\n\n26:56.520 --> 26:58.680\n It's literally the greatest science fiction book\n\n26:58.680 --> 26:59.520\n possibly ever written.\n\n26:59.520 --> 27:01.560\n Iain Banks is the man, yeah, for sure.\n\n27:01.560 --> 27:03.200\n What have you read?\n\n27:03.200 --> 27:04.520\n Just the Player of Games.\n\n27:04.520 --> 27:07.320\n I read that titles can't be copyrighted\n\n27:07.320 --> 27:08.280\n so you can just steal them.\n\n27:08.280 --> 27:09.920\n And I was like, Player of Games, sick.\n\n27:09.920 --> 27:10.760\n Nice.\n\n27:10.760 --> 27:12.760\n Yeah, so you can name your album.\n\n27:12.760 --> 27:13.600\n Like I always wanted to.\n\n27:13.600 --> 27:15.000\n Romeo and Juliet or something.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.080\n I always wanted to name an album War and Peace.\n\n27:17.080 --> 27:17.920\n Nice.\n\n27:17.920 --> 27:18.760\n Like that would be, like you.\n\n27:18.760 --> 27:20.440\n That is a good, that's a good,\n\n27:20.440 --> 27:21.600\n where have I heard that before?\n\n27:21.600 --> 27:24.280\n You can do that, like you could do that.\n\n27:24.280 --> 27:26.040\n Also things that are in the public domain.\n\n27:26.040 --> 27:27.160\n For people who have no clue,\n\n27:27.160 --> 27:29.680\n you do have a song called Player of Games.\n\n27:29.680 --> 27:30.680\n Yes, oh yeah.\n\n27:30.680 --> 27:33.840\n So Iain Banks, Surface Detail is in my opinion\n\n27:33.840 --> 27:37.200\n the best future that I've ever read about\n\n27:37.200 --> 27:39.540\n or heard about in science fiction.\n\n27:39.540 --> 27:44.540\n Basically there's the relationship with super intelligence,\n\n27:44.600 --> 27:49.140\n like artificial super intelligence is just, it's like great.\n\n27:50.400 --> 27:53.040\n I want to credit the person who coined this term\n\n27:53.040 --> 27:55.240\n because I love this term.\n\n27:55.240 --> 27:58.640\n And I feel like young women don't get enough credit in.\n\n28:00.160 --> 28:03.920\n Yeah, so if you go to Protopia Futures on Instagram,\n\n28:03.920 --> 28:05.480\n what is her name?\n\n28:05.480 --> 28:07.240\n Personalized donor experience at scale,\n\n28:07.240 --> 28:08.920\n our AI power donor experience.\n\n28:08.920 --> 28:13.920\n Monica Bealskite, I'm saying that wrong.\n\n28:15.360 --> 28:17.680\n And I'm probably gonna, I'm probably butchering this a bit,\n\n28:17.680 --> 28:21.580\n but Protopia is sort of, if utopia is unattainable,\n\n28:21.580 --> 28:26.000\n Protopia is sort of like, you know.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:28.640\n Wow, that's an awesome Instagram, Protopia Futures.\n\n28:28.640 --> 28:33.480\n A great, a future that is, you know, as good as we can get.\n\n28:33.480 --> 28:34.720\n The future, positive future.\n\n28:34.720 --> 28:38.360\n AI, is this a centralized AI in Surface Detail\n\n28:38.360 --> 28:39.280\n or is it distributed?\n\n28:39.280 --> 28:40.560\n What kind of AI is it?\n\n28:40.560 --> 28:42.800\n They mostly exist as giant super ships,\n\n28:42.800 --> 28:45.800\n like sort of like the guild ships in Dune.\n\n28:45.800 --> 28:47.960\n Like they're these giant ships that kind of move people\n\n28:47.960 --> 28:49.480\n around and the ships are sentient\n\n28:49.480 --> 28:52.240\n and they can talk to all the passengers.\n\n28:52.240 --> 28:56.400\n And I mean, there's a lot of different types of AI\n\n28:56.400 --> 28:58.320\n in the Banksyan future,\n\n28:58.320 --> 29:01.080\n but in the opening scene of Surface Detail,\n\n29:01.080 --> 29:02.320\n there's this place called the Culture\n\n29:02.320 --> 29:04.440\n and the Culture is basically a Protopian future.\n\n29:04.440 --> 29:07.320\n And a Protopian future, I think,\n\n29:07.320 --> 29:08.860\n is like a future that is like,\n\n29:09.760 --> 29:12.400\n obviously it's not utopia, it's not perfect.\n\n29:12.400 --> 29:14.000\n And like, cause like striving for utopia,\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.960\n I think feels hopeless and it's sort of like,\n\n29:16.960 --> 29:19.280\n maybe not the best terminology to be using.\n\n29:20.380 --> 29:23.960\n So it's like, it's a pretty good place.\n\n29:23.960 --> 29:27.660\n Like mostly like, you know,\n\n29:27.660 --> 29:29.860\n super intelligence and biological beings\n\n29:29.860 --> 29:31.880\n exist fairly in harmony.\n\n29:31.880 --> 29:33.120\n There's not too much war.\n\n29:33.120 --> 29:35.680\n There's like as close to equality as you can get,\n\n29:35.680 --> 29:38.680\n you know, it's like approximately a good future.\n\n29:38.680 --> 29:40.160\n Like there's really awesome stuff.\n\n29:40.160 --> 29:45.160\n It's, and in the opening scene,\n\n29:45.600 --> 29:49.520\n this girl, she's born as a sex slave outside of the culture.\n\n29:49.520 --> 29:51.200\n So she's in a society that doesn't adhere\n\n29:51.200 --> 29:52.620\n to the cultural values.\n\n29:52.620 --> 29:56.680\n She tries to kill the guy who is her like master,\n\n29:56.680 --> 29:59.040\n but he kills her, but unbeknownst to her,\n\n29:59.040 --> 30:01.360\n when she was traveling on a ship through the culture\n\n30:01.360 --> 30:05.160\n with him one day, a ship put a neural lace\n\n30:05.160 --> 30:08.480\n in her head and neural lace is sort of like,\n\n30:08.480 --> 30:13.040\n it's basically a Neuralink because life imitates art.\n\n30:13.040 --> 30:14.160\n It does indeed.\n\n30:14.160 --> 30:15.000\n It does indeed.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.320\n So she wakes up and the opening scene is her memory\n\n30:17.320 --> 30:19.040\n has been uploaded by this neural lace\n\n30:19.040 --> 30:20.000\n when she has been killed.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.640\n And now she gets to choose a new body.\n\n30:22.640 --> 30:26.900\n And this AI is interfacing with her recorded memory\n\n30:26.900 --> 30:29.900\n in her neural lace and helping her and being like,\n\n30:29.900 --> 30:31.320\n hello, you're dead.\n\n30:31.320 --> 30:33.740\n But because you had a neural lace, your memory's uploaded.\n\n30:33.740 --> 30:34.980\n Do you want to choose a new body?\n\n30:34.980 --> 30:36.440\n And you're going to be born here in the culture\n\n30:36.440 --> 30:38.600\n and like start a new life, which is just,\n\n30:38.600 --> 30:39.920\n that's like the opening.\n\n30:39.920 --> 30:41.400\n It's like so sick.\n\n30:41.400 --> 30:43.640\n And the ship is the super intelligence.\n\n30:43.640 --> 30:45.120\n All the ships are kind of super intelligence.\n\n30:45.120 --> 30:47.720\n But they still want to preserve a kind of rich,\n\n30:47.720 --> 30:49.680\n fulfilling experience for the humans.\n\n30:49.680 --> 30:51.000\n Yeah, like they're like friends with the humans.\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.560\n And then there's a bunch of ships that don't want to exist\n\n30:53.560 --> 30:56.000\n with biological beings, but they just have their own place\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:57.080\n like way over there.\n\n30:57.080 --> 30:58.900\n But they don't, they just do their own thing.\n\n30:58.900 --> 31:00.320\n They're not necessarily.\n\n31:00.320 --> 31:03.640\n So it's a pretty, this protopian existence is pretty peaceful.\n\n31:03.640 --> 31:05.860\n Yeah, I mean, and then, for example,\n\n31:05.860 --> 31:10.200\n one of the main fights in the book is they're fighting,\n\n31:10.200 --> 31:13.820\n there's these artificial hells that,\n\n31:13.820 --> 31:17.600\n and people don't think it's ethical to have artificial hell.\n\n31:17.600 --> 31:19.520\n Like basically when people do crime, they get sent,\n\n31:19.520 --> 31:21.140\n like when they die, their memory gets sent\n\n31:21.140 --> 31:23.480\n to an artificial hell and they're eternally tortured.\n\n31:23.480 --> 31:27.660\n And so, and then the way that society is deciding\n\n31:27.660 --> 31:29.280\n whether or not to have the artificial hell\n\n31:29.280 --> 31:31.900\n is that they're having these simulated,\n\n31:31.900 --> 31:33.200\n they're having like a simulated war.\n\n31:33.200 --> 31:36.000\n So instead of actual blood, you know,\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.520\n people are basically essentially fighting in a video game\n\n31:38.520 --> 31:40.080\n to choose the outcome of this.\n\n31:40.080 --> 31:42.760\n But they're still experiencing the suffering\n\n31:42.760 --> 31:44.520\n in this artificial hell or no?\n\n31:44.520 --> 31:45.760\n Can you experience stuff or?\n\n31:45.760 --> 31:47.200\n So the artificial hell sucks.\n\n31:47.200 --> 31:48.800\n And a lot of people in the culture want to get rid\n\n31:48.800 --> 31:49.920\n of the artificial hell.\n\n31:49.920 --> 31:51.280\n There's a simulated wars,\n\n31:51.280 --> 31:53.320\n are they happening in the artificial hell?\n\n31:53.320 --> 31:55.520\n So no, the simulated wars are happening\n\n31:55.520 --> 31:57.080\n outside of the artificial hell,\n\n31:57.080 --> 31:59.960\n between the political factions who are,\n\n31:59.960 --> 32:02.880\n so this political faction says we should have simulated hell\n\n32:02.880 --> 32:05.000\n to deter crime.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:06.960\n And this political faction is saying,\n\n32:06.960 --> 32:08.920\n no, simulated hell is unethical.\n\n32:08.920 --> 32:11.700\n And so instead of like having, you know,\n\n32:11.700 --> 32:13.120\n blowing each other up with nukes,\n\n32:13.120 --> 32:17.160\n they're having like a giant Fortnite battle\n\n32:17.160 --> 32:21.680\n to decide this, which, you know, to me that's protopia.\n\n32:21.680 --> 32:24.520\n That's like, okay, we can have war without death.\n\n32:25.640 --> 32:27.440\n You know, I don't think there should be simulated hells.\n\n32:27.440 --> 32:29.800\n I think that is definitely one of the ways\n\n32:29.800 --> 32:34.280\n in which technology could go very, very, very, very wrong.\n\n32:34.280 --> 32:37.120\n So almost punishing people in a digital space\n\n32:37.120 --> 32:37.960\n or something like that.\n\n32:37.960 --> 32:40.320\n Yeah, like torturing people's memories.\n\n32:41.680 --> 32:44.760\n So either as a deterrent, like if you committed a crime,\n\n32:44.760 --> 32:46.560\n but also just for personal pleasure,\n\n32:46.560 --> 32:49.260\n if there's some sick, demented humans in this world.\n\n32:50.520 --> 32:52.320\n Dan Carlin actually has this\n\n32:55.040 --> 32:59.440\n episode of Hardcore History on painful attainment.\n\n32:59.440 --> 33:02.280\n Oh, that episode is fucked.\n\n33:02.280 --> 33:05.360\n It's dark, because he kind of goes through human history\n\n33:05.360 --> 33:08.800\n and says like, we as humans seem to enjoy,\n\n33:08.800 --> 33:12.120\n secretly enjoy or used to be openly enjoy\n\n33:12.120 --> 33:14.400\n sort of the torture and the death,\n\n33:14.400 --> 33:17.720\n watching the death and torture of other humans.\n\n33:17.720 --> 33:21.720\n I do think if people were consenting,\n\n33:21.720 --> 33:26.240\n we should be allowed to have gladiatorial matches.\n\n33:26.240 --> 33:28.560\n But consent is hard to achieve in those situations.\n\n33:28.560 --> 33:31.080\n It always starts getting slippery.\n\n33:31.080 --> 33:32.760\n Like it could be also forced consent,\n\n33:32.760 --> 33:35.280\n like it starts getting weird.\n\n33:35.280 --> 33:37.360\n There's way too much excitement.\n\n33:37.360 --> 33:38.620\n Like this is what he highlights.\n\n33:38.620 --> 33:40.520\n There's something about human nature\n\n33:40.520 --> 33:42.280\n that wants to see that violence.\n\n33:42.280 --> 33:44.280\n And it's really dark.\n\n33:44.280 --> 33:47.160\n And you hope that we can sort of overcome\n\n33:47.160 --> 33:48.840\n that aspect of human nature,\n\n33:48.840 --> 33:51.280\n but that's still within us somewhere.\n\n33:51.280 --> 33:53.240\n Well, I think that's what we're doing right now.\n\n33:53.240 --> 33:56.400\n I have this theory that what is very important\n\n33:56.400 --> 34:00.880\n about the current moment is that all of evolution\n\n34:00.880 --> 34:03.400\n has been survival of the fittest up until now.\n\n34:03.400 --> 34:07.260\n And at some point, the lines are kind of fuzzy,\n\n34:07.260 --> 34:12.080\n but in the recent past, or maybe even just right now,\n\n34:12.080 --> 34:14.400\n we're getting to this point\n\n34:14.400 --> 34:19.400\n where we can choose intelligent design.\n\n34:19.440 --> 34:23.440\n Like we probably since like the integration of the iPhone,\n\n34:23.440 --> 34:24.820\n like we are becoming cyborgs.\n\n34:24.820 --> 34:27.680\n Like our brains are fundamentally changed.\n\n34:27.680 --> 34:29.380\n Everyone who grew up with electronics,\n\n34:29.380 --> 34:32.520\n we are fundamentally different from previous,\n\n34:32.520 --> 34:33.440\n from homo sapiens.\n\n34:33.440 --> 34:34.680\n I call us homo techno.\n\n34:34.680 --> 34:36.840\n I think we have evolved into homo techno,\n\n34:36.840 --> 34:39.380\n which is like essentially a new species.\n\n34:39.380 --> 34:41.380\n Like if you look at the way,\n\n34:41.380 --> 34:43.400\n if you took an MRI of my brain\n\n34:43.400 --> 34:46.600\n and you took an MRI of like a medieval brain,\n\n34:46.600 --> 34:48.160\n I think it would be very different\n\n34:48.160 --> 34:49.960\n the way that it has evolved.\n\n34:49.960 --> 34:52.000\n Do you think when historians look back at this time,\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.040\n they'll see like this was a fundamental shift\n\n34:54.040 --> 34:54.880\n to what a human being is?\n\n34:54.880 --> 34:58.040\n I think, I do not think we are still homo sapiens.\n\n34:58.040 --> 34:59.520\n I believe we are homo techno.\n\n34:59.520 --> 35:01.280\n And I think we have evolved.\n\n35:04.400 --> 35:07.380\n And I think right now, the way we are evolving,\n\n35:07.380 --> 35:09.080\n we can choose how we do that.\n\n35:09.080 --> 35:10.680\n And I think we are being very reckless\n\n35:10.680 --> 35:11.800\n about how we're doing that.\n\n35:11.800 --> 35:13.020\n Like we're just having social media,\n\n35:13.020 --> 35:16.320\n but I think this idea that like this is a time\n\n35:16.320 --> 35:19.600\n to choose intelligent design should be taken very seriously.\n\n35:19.600 --> 35:24.200\n It like now is the moment to reprogram the human computer.\n\n35:24.200 --> 35:26.400\n It's like, if you go blind,\n\n35:27.260 --> 35:29.920\n your visual cortex will get taken over\n\n35:29.920 --> 35:32.000\n with other functions.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:35.160\n We can choose our own evolution.\n\n35:35.160 --> 35:37.160\n We can change the way our brains work.\n\n35:37.160 --> 35:39.920\n And so we actually have a huge responsibility to do that.\n\n35:39.920 --> 35:42.880\n And I think I'm not sure who should be responsible for that,\n\n35:42.880 --> 35:45.200\n but there's definitely not adequate education.\n\n35:45.200 --> 35:46.940\n We're being inundated with all this technology\n\n35:46.940 --> 35:49.020\n that is fundamentally changing\n\n35:49.020 --> 35:50.900\n the physical structure of our brains.\n\n35:50.900 --> 35:54.780\n And we are not adequately responding to that\n\n35:55.920 --> 35:57.460\n to choose how we wanna evolve.\n\n35:57.460 --> 36:00.600\n And we could evolve, we could be really whatever we want.\n\n36:00.600 --> 36:03.040\n And I think this is a really important time.\n\n36:03.040 --> 36:06.440\n And I think if we choose correctly and we choose wisely,\n\n36:06.440 --> 36:09.720\n consciousness could exist for a very long time\n\n36:09.720 --> 36:12.720\n and integration with AI could be extremely positive.\n\n36:12.720 --> 36:14.400\n And I don't think enough people are focusing\n\n36:14.400 --> 36:16.360\n on this specific situation.\n\n36:16.360 --> 36:19.160\n Do you think we might irreversibly screw things up\n\n36:19.160 --> 36:20.000\n if we get things wrong now?\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:21.640\n Because the flip side of that,\n\n36:21.640 --> 36:23.200\n it seems humans are pretty adaptive.\n\n36:23.200 --> 36:25.960\n So maybe the way we figure things out\n\n36:25.960 --> 36:28.080\n is by screwing it up, like social media.\n\n36:28.080 --> 36:30.600\n Over a generation, we'll see the negative effects\n\n36:30.600 --> 36:33.080\n of social media, and then we build new social medias,\n\n36:33.080 --> 36:34.960\n and we just keep improving stuff.\n\n36:34.960 --> 36:37.680\n And then we learn from the failures of the past.\n\n36:37.680 --> 36:39.920\n Because humans seem to be really adaptive.\n\n36:39.920 --> 36:43.020\n On the flip side, we can get it wrong in a way\n\n36:43.020 --> 36:46.400\n where literally we create weapons of war\n\n36:46.400 --> 36:48.360\n or increase hate.\n\n36:48.360 --> 36:51.840\n Past a certain threshold, we really do a lot of damage.\n\n36:51.840 --> 36:53.700\n I mean, I think we're optimized\n\n36:53.700 --> 36:55.680\n to notice the negative things.\n\n36:55.680 --> 37:00.120\n But I would actually say one of the things\n\n37:00.120 --> 37:02.140\n that I think people aren't noticing\n\n37:02.140 --> 37:03.520\n is if you look at Silicon Valley\n\n37:03.520 --> 37:06.600\n and you look at the technocracy,\n\n37:06.600 --> 37:09.000\n like what's been happening there.\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.460\n When Silicon Valley started, it was all just Facebook\n\n37:11.460 --> 37:14.040\n and all this for profit crap\n\n37:14.040 --> 37:16.920\n that really wasn't particular.\n\n37:16.920 --> 37:21.920\n I guess it was useful, but it's sort of just whatever.\n\n37:22.200 --> 37:26.680\n But now you see lab grown meat, compostable,\n\n37:26.680 --> 37:30.200\n or biodegradable, single use cutlery,\n\n37:30.200 --> 37:33.120\n or meditation apps.\n\n37:33.120 --> 37:38.120\n I think we are actually evolving and changing,\n\n37:38.400 --> 37:39.600\n and technology is changing.\n\n37:39.600 --> 37:43.840\n I think there just maybe there isn't\n\n37:43.840 --> 37:48.140\n quite enough education about this.\n\n37:48.140 --> 37:52.240\n And also, I don't know if there's quite enough incentive\n\n37:52.240 --> 37:55.140\n for it because I think the way capitalism works,\n\n37:56.600 --> 37:58.480\n what we define as profit,\n\n37:58.480 --> 38:00.400\n we're also working on an old model\n\n38:00.400 --> 38:01.540\n of what we define as profit.\n\n38:01.540 --> 38:06.400\n I really think if we changed the idea of profit\n\n38:06.400 --> 38:08.200\n to include social good,\n\n38:08.200 --> 38:09.840\n you can have economic profit,\n\n38:09.840 --> 38:12.580\n social good also counting as profit\n\n38:12.580 --> 38:15.100\n would incentivize things that are more useful\n\n38:15.100 --> 38:16.960\n and more whatever spiritual technology\n\n38:16.960 --> 38:21.280\n or positive technology or things that help reprogram\n\n38:21.280 --> 38:22.920\n a human computer in a good way\n\n38:22.920 --> 38:27.920\n or things that help us intelligently design our new brains.\n\n38:28.280 --> 38:30.480\n Yeah, there's no reason why within the framework\n\n38:30.480 --> 38:33.800\n of capitalism, the word profit or the idea of profit\n\n38:33.800 --> 38:37.360\n can't also incorporate the well being of a human being.\n\n38:37.360 --> 38:40.100\n So like long term well being, long term happiness.\n\n38:41.440 --> 38:43.840\n Or even for example, we were talking about motherhood,\n\n38:43.840 --> 38:44.840\n like part of the reason I'm so late\n\n38:44.840 --> 38:47.400\n is because I had to get the baby to bed.\n\n38:47.400 --> 38:48.880\n And it's like, I keep thinking about motherhood,\n\n38:48.880 --> 38:53.680\n how under capitalism, it's like this extremely essential job\n\n38:53.680 --> 38:56.440\n that is very difficult that is not compensated.\n\n38:56.440 --> 38:58.420\n And we sort of like value things\n\n38:58.420 --> 39:01.880\n by how much we compensate them.\n\n39:01.880 --> 39:04.880\n And so we really devalue motherhood in our society\n\n39:04.880 --> 39:06.080\n and pretty much all societies.\n\n39:06.080 --> 39:08.160\n Like capitalism does not recognize motherhood.\n\n39:08.160 --> 39:11.120\n It's just a job that you're supposed to do for free.\n\n39:11.120 --> 39:15.360\n And it's like, but I feel like producing great humans\n\n39:15.360 --> 39:19.440\n should be seen as a great, as profit under capitalism.\n\n39:19.440 --> 39:21.480\n Like that should be, that's like a huge social good.\n\n39:21.480 --> 39:24.160\n Like every awesome human that gets made\n\n39:24.160 --> 39:25.600\n adds so much to the world.\n\n39:25.600 --> 39:29.840\n So like if that was integrated into the profit structure,\n\n39:29.840 --> 39:34.240\n then, you know, and if we potentially found a way\n\n39:34.240 --> 39:35.640\n to compensate motherhood.\n\n39:35.640 --> 39:37.920\n So come up with a compensation\n\n39:37.920 --> 39:40.640\n that's much broader than just money or.\n\n39:40.640 --> 39:42.040\n Or it could just be money.\n\n39:42.040 --> 39:45.520\n Like, what if you just made, I don't know,\n\n39:45.520 --> 39:46.640\n but I don't know how you'd pay for that.\n\n39:46.640 --> 39:49.380\n Like, I mean, that's where you start getting into.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:56.360\n Reallocation of resources that people get upset over.\n\n39:56.360 --> 39:58.480\n Well, like what if we made like a motherhood Dow?\n\n39:58.480 --> 40:01.320\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n40:01.320 --> 40:06.320\n And, you know, used it to fund like single mothers,\n\n40:07.680 --> 40:12.680\n like, you know, pay for making babies.\n\n40:13.640 --> 40:17.360\n So, I mean, if you create and put beautiful things\n\n40:17.360 --> 40:19.760\n onto the world, that could be companies,\n\n40:19.760 --> 40:22.640\n that can be bridges, that could be art,\n\n40:22.640 --> 40:24.280\n that could be a lot of things,\n\n40:24.280 --> 40:28.080\n and that could be children, which are.\n\n40:28.080 --> 40:29.320\n Or education or.\n\n40:29.320 --> 40:32.380\n Anything, that should be valued by society,\n\n40:32.380 --> 40:35.160\n and that should be somehow incorporated into the framework\n\n40:35.160 --> 40:38.480\n of what, as a market, of what.\n\n40:38.480 --> 40:40.560\n Like, if you contribute children to this world,\n\n40:40.560 --> 40:42.440\n that should be valued and respected\n\n40:42.440 --> 40:47.440\n and sort of celebrated, like, proportional to what it is,\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:51.560\n which is, it's the thing that fuels human civilization.\n\n40:51.560 --> 40:53.000\n Yeah, like I. It's kind of important.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:54.600\n I feel like everyone's always saying,\n\n40:54.600 --> 40:56.520\n I mean, I think we're in very different social spheres,\n\n40:56.520 --> 40:58.880\n but everyone's always saying, like, dismantle capitalism.\n\n40:58.880 --> 40:59.840\n And I'm like, well, okay, well,\n\n40:59.840 --> 41:02.120\n I don't think the government should own everything.\n\n41:02.120 --> 41:04.200\n Like, I don't think we should not have private ownership.\n\n41:04.200 --> 41:05.360\n Like, that's scary.\n\n41:05.360 --> 41:07.320\n You know, like that starts getting into weird stuff\n\n41:07.320 --> 41:08.920\n and just sort of like,\n\n41:08.920 --> 41:10.080\n I feel there's almost no way to do that\n\n41:10.080 --> 41:12.060\n without a police state, you know?\n\n41:13.520 --> 41:16.980\n But obviously, capitalism has some major flaws.\n\n41:16.980 --> 41:20.360\n And I think actually Mac showed me this idea\n\n41:20.360 --> 41:23.480\n called social capitalism, which is a form of capitalism\n\n41:23.480 --> 41:28.480\n that just like considers social good to be also profit.\n\n41:28.480 --> 41:31.560\n Like, you know, it's like, right now companies need to,\n\n41:31.560 --> 41:34.560\n like, you're supposed to grow every quarter or whatever\n\n41:34.560 --> 41:38.700\n to like show that you're functioning well,\n\n41:38.700 --> 41:39.920\n but it's like, okay, well,\n\n41:39.920 --> 41:42.920\n what if you kept the same amount of profit?\n\n41:42.920 --> 41:43.920\n You're still in the green,\n\n41:43.920 --> 41:45.600\n but then you have also all this social good.\n\n41:45.600 --> 41:47.560\n Like, do you really need all this extra economic growth\n\n41:47.560 --> 41:49.520\n or could you add this social good and that counts?\n\n41:49.520 --> 41:54.000\n And, you know, I don't know if, I am not an economist.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:56.360\n I have no idea how this could be achieved, but.\n\n41:56.360 --> 41:58.720\n I don't think economists know how anything\n\n41:58.720 --> 42:00.320\n could be achieved either, but they pretend.\n\n42:00.320 --> 42:02.280\n It's the thing, they construct a model\n\n42:02.280 --> 42:06.160\n and they go on TV shows and sound like an expert.\n\n42:06.160 --> 42:08.540\n That's the definition of economist.\n\n42:08.540 --> 42:12.260\n How did being a mother, becoming a mother\n\n42:12.260 --> 42:15.240\n change you as a human being, would you say?\n\n42:16.160 --> 42:21.000\n Man, I think it kind of changed everything\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:22.380\n and it's still changing me a lot.\n\n42:22.380 --> 42:24.880\n It's actually changing me more right now in this moment\n\n42:24.880 --> 42:26.400\n than it was before.\n\n42:26.400 --> 42:28.520\n Like today, like this?\n\n42:28.520 --> 42:32.480\n Just like in the most recent months and stuff.\n\n42:33.480 --> 42:37.640\n Can you elucidate that, how change,\n\n42:37.640 --> 42:39.360\n like when you wake up in the morning\n\n42:39.360 --> 42:42.920\n and you look at yourself, it's again, which, who are you?\n\n42:42.920 --> 42:45.520\n How have you become different, would you say?\n\n42:45.520 --> 42:50.520\n I think it's just really reorienting my priorities.\n\n42:50.680 --> 42:53.400\n And at first I was really fighting against that\n\n42:53.400 --> 42:55.560\n because I somehow felt it was like a failure\n\n42:55.560 --> 42:56.680\n of feminism or something.\n\n42:56.680 --> 42:59.840\n Like I felt like it was like bad\n\n42:59.840 --> 43:04.320\n if like my kids started mattering more than my work.\n\n43:05.720 --> 43:08.960\n And then like more recently I started sort of analyzing\n\n43:08.960 --> 43:12.240\n that thought in myself and being like,\n\n43:12.240 --> 43:13.920\n that's also kind of a construct.\n\n43:13.920 --> 43:16.280\n It's like, we've just devalued motherhood so much\n\n43:16.280 --> 43:21.280\n in our culture that like, I feel guilty for caring\n\n43:21.280 --> 43:23.320\n about my kids more than I care about my work.\n\n43:23.320 --> 43:25.800\n So feminism includes breaking out\n\n43:25.800 --> 43:27.520\n of whatever the construct is.\n\n43:28.360 --> 43:30.900\n So just continually breaking,\n\n43:30.900 --> 43:34.640\n it's like freedom empower you to be free.\n\n43:34.640 --> 43:36.160\n And that means...\n\n43:37.560 --> 43:40.040\n But it also, but like being a mother,\n\n43:40.040 --> 43:41.840\n like I'm so much more creative.\n\n43:41.840 --> 43:45.880\n Like I cannot believe the massive amount\n\n43:45.880 --> 43:48.440\n of brain growth that I am.\n\n43:48.440 --> 43:49.280\n Why do you think that is?\n\n43:49.280 --> 43:51.940\n Just cause like the stakes are higher somehow?\n\n43:51.940 --> 43:56.940\n I think it's like, it's just so trippy\n\n43:58.020 --> 44:00.800\n watching consciousness emerge.\n\n44:00.800 --> 44:05.800\n It's just like, it's like going on a crazy journey\n\n44:06.860 --> 44:07.700\n or something.\n\n44:07.700 --> 44:10.220\n It's like the craziest science fiction novel\n\n44:10.220 --> 44:11.060\n you could ever read.\n\n44:11.060 --> 44:15.100\n It's just so crazy watching consciousness come into being.\n\n44:15.100 --> 44:16.540\n And then at the same time,\n\n44:16.540 --> 44:21.140\n like you're forced to value your time so much.\n\n44:21.140 --> 44:23.520\n Like when I have creative time now, it's so sacred.\n\n44:23.520 --> 44:28.520\n I need to like be really fricking on it.\n\n44:29.380 --> 44:34.380\n But the other thing is that I used to just be like a cynic\n\n44:34.680 --> 44:35.520\n and I used to just wanna...\n\n44:35.520 --> 44:38.060\n Like my last album was called Miss Anthropocene\n\n44:38.060 --> 44:42.620\n and it was like this like, it was like a study in villainy\n\n44:42.620 --> 44:44.980\n or like it was like, well, what if we have,\n\n44:44.980 --> 44:46.820\n instead of the old gods, we have like new gods\n\n44:46.820 --> 44:49.700\n and it's like Miss Anthropocene is like misanthrope\n\n44:49.700 --> 44:53.100\n like and Anthropocene, which is like the, you know,\n\n44:53.100 --> 44:55.780\n like and she's the goddess of climate change or whatever.\n\n44:55.780 --> 44:56.980\n And she's like destroying the world.\n\n44:56.980 --> 44:59.660\n And it was just like, it was like dark\n\n44:59.660 --> 45:01.380\n and it was like a study in villainy.\n\n45:01.380 --> 45:02.700\n And it was sort of just like,\n\n45:02.700 --> 45:05.800\n like I used to like have no problem just making cynical,\n\n45:06.820 --> 45:08.980\n angry, scary art.\n\n45:08.980 --> 45:11.100\n And not that there's anything wrong with that,\n\n45:11.100 --> 45:13.580\n but I think having kids just makes you such an optimist.\n\n45:13.580 --> 45:16.940\n It just inherently makes you wanna be an optimist so bad\n\n45:16.940 --> 45:20.380\n that like I feel more responsibility\n\n45:20.380 --> 45:23.820\n to make more optimistic things.\n\n45:23.820 --> 45:25.720\n And I get a lot of shit for it\n\n45:25.720 --> 45:28.500\n because everyone's like, oh, you're so privileged.\n\n45:28.500 --> 45:30.260\n Stop talking about like pie in the sky,\n\n45:30.260 --> 45:32.700\n stupid concepts and focus on like the now.\n\n45:32.700 --> 45:36.500\n But it's like, I think if we don't ideate\n\n45:36.500 --> 45:40.520\n about futures that could be good,\n\n45:40.520 --> 45:41.540\n we won't be able to get them.\n\n45:41.540 --> 45:42.780\n If everything is Blade Runner,\n\n45:42.780 --> 45:44.260\n then we're gonna end up with Blade Runner.\n\n45:44.260 --> 45:47.300\n It's like, as we said earlier, life imitates art.\n\n45:47.300 --> 45:49.740\n Like life really does imitate art.\n\n45:49.740 --> 45:53.960\n And so we really need more protopian or utopian art.\n\n45:53.960 --> 45:56.060\n I think this is incredibly essential\n\n45:56.060 --> 45:58.060\n for the future of humanity.\n\n45:58.060 --> 46:00.380\n And I think the current discourse\n\n46:00.380 --> 46:05.380\n where that's seen as a thinking about protopia or utopia\n\n46:09.660 --> 46:11.580\n is seen as a dismissal of the problems\n\n46:11.580 --> 46:12.420\n that we currently have.\n\n46:12.420 --> 46:14.980\n I think that is an incorrect mindset.\n\n46:16.160 --> 46:20.180\n And like having kids just makes me wanna imagine\n\n46:20.180 --> 46:24.420\n amazing futures that like maybe I won't be able to build,\n\n46:24.420 --> 46:26.900\n but they will be able to build if they want to.\n\n46:26.900 --> 46:28.300\n Yeah, it does seem like ideation\n\n46:28.300 --> 46:30.220\n is a precursor to creation.\n\n46:30.220 --> 46:33.820\n So you have to imagine it in order to be able to build it.\n\n46:33.820 --> 46:36.700\n And there is a sad thing about human nature\n\n46:36.700 --> 46:40.740\n that somehow a cynical view of the world\n\n46:40.740 --> 46:44.060\n is seen as a insightful view.\n\n46:44.060 --> 46:46.980\n You know, cynicism is often confused for insight,\n\n46:46.980 --> 46:48.900\n which is sad to see.\n\n46:48.900 --> 46:52.620\n And optimism is confused for naivete.\n\n46:52.620 --> 46:53.460\n Yes, yes.\n\n46:53.460 --> 46:57.700\n Like you don't, you're blinded by your,\n\n46:57.700 --> 46:59.320\n maybe your privilege or whatever.\n\n46:59.320 --> 47:02.020\n You're blinded by something, but you're certainly blinded.\n\n47:02.020 --> 47:04.560\n That's sad, that's sad to see\n\n47:04.560 --> 47:06.020\n because it seems like the optimists\n\n47:06.020 --> 47:10.260\n are the ones that create our future.\n\n47:10.260 --> 47:11.900\n They're the ones that build.\n\n47:11.900 --> 47:13.560\n In order to build the crazy thing,\n\n47:13.560 --> 47:14.740\n you have to be optimistic.\n\n47:14.740 --> 47:19.220\n You have to be either stupid or excited or passionate\n\n47:19.220 --> 47:22.740\n or mad enough to actually believe that it can be built.\n\n47:22.740 --> 47:24.200\n And those are the people that built it.\n\n47:24.200 --> 47:28.100\n My favorite quote of all time is from Star Wars, Episode 8,\n\n47:29.020 --> 47:30.940\n which I know everyone hates.\n\n47:30.940 --> 47:32.420\n Do you like Star Wars, Episode 8?\n\n47:32.420 --> 47:35.840\n No, yeah, probably I would say I would probably hate it, yeah.\n\n47:36.820 --> 47:38.940\n I don't have strong feelings about it.\n\n47:38.940 --> 47:39.780\n Let me backtrack.\n\n47:39.780 --> 47:41.500\n I don't have strong feelings about Star Wars.\n\n47:41.500 --> 47:43.040\n I'm a Tolkien person.\n\n47:43.040 --> 47:47.860\n I'm more into dragons and orcs and ogres.\n\n47:47.860 --> 47:49.620\n Yeah, I mean, Tolkien forever.\n\n47:49.620 --> 47:51.780\n I really want to have one more son and call him,\n\n47:51.780 --> 47:55.260\n I thought Tao Tecno Tolkien would be cool.\n\n47:55.260 --> 47:56.940\n It's a lot of T's, I like it.\n\n47:56.940 --> 47:59.260\n Yeah, and well, and Tao is six, two, eight, two pi.\n\n47:59.260 --> 48:01.740\n Yeah, Tao Tecno, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n48:01.740 --> 48:04.780\n And then techno is obviously the best genre of music,\n\n48:04.780 --> 48:06.260\n but also like technocracy.\n\n48:06.260 --> 48:07.100\n It just sounds really good.\n\n48:07.100 --> 48:11.260\n Yeah, that's right, and techno Tolkien, Tao Tecno Tolkien.\n\n48:11.260 --> 48:12.100\n That's a good, that's it.\n\n48:12.100 --> 48:14.980\n Tao Tecno Tolkien, but Star Wars, Episode 8,\n\n48:15.980 --> 48:17.260\n I know a lot of people have issues with it.\n\n48:17.260 --> 48:18.720\n Personally, on the record,\n\n48:18.720 --> 48:21.220\n I think it's the best Star Wars film.\n\n48:24.100 --> 48:25.180\n You're starting trouble today.\n\n48:25.180 --> 48:29.260\n Yeah, but don't kill what you hate, save what you love.\n\n48:29.260 --> 48:30.460\n Don't kill what you hate.\n\n48:30.460 --> 48:32.340\n Don't kill what you hate, save what you love.\n\n48:32.340 --> 48:34.980\n And I think we're, in society right now,\n\n48:34.980 --> 48:36.580\n we're in a diagnosis mode.\n\n48:36.580 --> 48:39.140\n We're just diagnosing and diagnosing and diagnosing,\n\n48:39.140 --> 48:41.660\n and we're trying to kill what we hate,\n\n48:41.660 --> 48:44.220\n and we're not trying to save what we love enough.\n\n48:44.220 --> 48:46.260\n And there's this Buckminster Fuller quote,\n\n48:46.260 --> 48:47.140\n which I'm gonna butcher,\n\n48:47.140 --> 48:48.220\n because I don't remember it correctly,\n\n48:48.220 --> 48:50.520\n but it's something along the lines of,\n\n48:52.580 --> 48:57.580\n don't try to destroy the old bad models,\n\n48:58.340 --> 49:01.600\n render them obsolete with better models.\n\n49:03.100 --> 49:05.620\n Maybe we don't need to destroy the oil industry.\n\n49:05.620 --> 49:08.940\n Maybe we just create a great new battery technology\n\n49:08.940 --> 49:10.340\n and sustainable transport,\n\n49:10.340 --> 49:13.140\n and just make it economically unreasonable\n\n49:13.140 --> 49:15.460\n to still continue to rely on fossil fuels.\n\n49:17.100 --> 49:20.180\n It's like, don't kill what you hate, save what you love.\n\n49:20.180 --> 49:24.460\n Make new things and just render the old things unusable.\n\n49:24.460 --> 49:29.060\n It's like if the college debt is so bad,\n\n49:29.060 --> 49:31.500\n and universities are so expensive,\n\n49:31.500 --> 49:35.700\n and I feel like education is becoming obsolete.\n\n49:35.700 --> 49:38.460\n I feel like we could completely revolutionize education,\n\n49:38.460 --> 49:39.380\n and we could make it free.\n\n49:39.380 --> 49:40.420\n And it's like, you look at JSTOR,\n\n49:40.420 --> 49:43.460\n and you have to pay to get all the studies and everything.\n\n49:43.460 --> 49:46.520\n What if we created a DAO that bought JSTOR,\n\n49:46.520 --> 49:48.460\n or we created a DAO that was funding studies,\n\n49:48.460 --> 49:51.880\n and those studies were open source, or free for everyone.\n\n49:51.880 --> 49:55.100\n And what if we just open sourced education\n\n49:55.100 --> 49:56.980\n and decentralized education and made it free,\n\n49:56.980 --> 50:00.900\n and all research was on the internet,\n\n50:00.900 --> 50:05.220\n and all the outcomes of studies were on the internet,\n\n50:05.220 --> 50:10.060\n and no one has student debt,\n\n50:10.060 --> 50:14.220\n and you just take tests when you apply for a job,\n\n50:14.220 --> 50:16.920\n and if you're qualified, then you can work there.\n\n50:18.060 --> 50:20.500\n This is just like, I don't know how anything works.\n\n50:20.500 --> 50:22.700\n I'm just randomly ranting, but.\n\n50:22.700 --> 50:23.920\n I like the humility.\n\n50:24.920 --> 50:27.780\n You gotta think from just basic first principles.\n\n50:27.780 --> 50:28.900\n What is the problem?\n\n50:28.900 --> 50:29.740\n What's broken?\n\n50:29.740 --> 50:30.740\n What are some ideas?\n\n50:30.740 --> 50:31.580\n That's it.\n\n50:31.580 --> 50:33.100\n And get excited about those ideas,\n\n50:33.100 --> 50:34.660\n and share your excitement,\n\n50:34.660 --> 50:37.100\n and don't tear each other down.\n\n50:37.100 --> 50:38.140\n It's just when you kill things,\n\n50:38.140 --> 50:40.140\n you often end up killing yourself.\n\n50:40.140 --> 50:43.380\n Like war is not a one sided,\n\n50:43.380 --> 50:45.060\n like you're not gonna go in and just kill them,\n\n50:45.060 --> 50:46.900\n like you're gonna get stabbed.\n\n50:46.900 --> 50:50.380\n It's like, and I think when I talk about this nexus point\n\n50:50.380 --> 50:53.320\n of that we're in this point in society\n\n50:53.320 --> 50:55.140\n where we're switching to intelligent design,\n\n50:55.140 --> 50:57.220\n I think part of our switch to intelligent design\n\n50:57.220 --> 50:59.480\n is that we need to choose nonviolence.\n\n50:59.480 --> 51:04.300\n And we need to, like, I think we can choose to start,\n\n51:04.300 --> 51:07.380\n I don't think we can eradicate violence from our species,\n\n51:07.380 --> 51:10.540\n because I think we need it a little bit,\n\n51:10.540 --> 51:12.100\n but I think we can choose\n\n51:12.100 --> 51:14.900\n to really reorient our primitive brains\n\n51:14.900 --> 51:16.300\n that are fighting over scarcity,\n\n51:16.300 --> 51:20.620\n and that are so attack oriented,\n\n51:20.620 --> 51:25.420\n and move into, we can optimize for creativity and building.\n\n51:25.420 --> 51:27.220\n Yeah, it's interesting to think how that happens,\n\n51:27.220 --> 51:29.580\n so some of it is just education,\n\n51:29.580 --> 51:34.100\n some of it is living life and introspecting your own mind,\n\n51:34.100 --> 51:37.780\n and trying to live up to the better angels of your nature\n\n51:37.780 --> 51:41.800\n for each one of us, all those kinds of things at scale.\n\n51:41.800 --> 51:44.580\n That's how we can sort of start to minimize\n\n51:44.580 --> 51:48.160\n the amount of destructive war in our world,\n\n51:48.160 --> 51:51.100\n and that's, to me, probably you're the same,\n\n51:51.100 --> 51:55.220\n technology is a really promising way to do that.\n\n51:55.220 --> 51:57.700\n Like, social media should be a really promising way\n\n51:57.700 --> 52:00.060\n to do that, it's a way we connect.\n\n52:00.060 --> 52:01.540\n I, you know, for the most part,\n\n52:01.540 --> 52:03.260\n I really enjoy social media.\n\n52:03.260 --> 52:05.180\n I just know all the negative stuff.\n\n52:05.180 --> 52:07.540\n I don't engage with any of the negative stuff.\n\n52:07.540 --> 52:10.300\n Just not even, like, by blocking\n\n52:10.300 --> 52:11.400\n or any of that kind of stuff,\n\n52:11.400 --> 52:14.740\n but just not letting it enter my mind.\n\n52:14.740 --> 52:18.500\n Like, just, like, when somebody says something negative,\n\n52:18.500 --> 52:23.260\n I see it, I immediately think positive thoughts about them,\n\n52:23.260 --> 52:26.260\n and I just forget they exist after that.\n\n52:26.260 --> 52:28.640\n Just move on, because, like, that negative energy,\n\n52:28.640 --> 52:30.300\n if I return the negative energy,\n\n52:30.300 --> 52:34.260\n they're going to get excited in a negative way right back,\n\n52:34.260 --> 52:37.380\n and it's just this kind of vicious cycle.\n\n52:38.420 --> 52:40.540\n But you would think technology would assist us\n\n52:40.540 --> 52:42.860\n in this process of letting go,\n\n52:42.860 --> 52:44.720\n of not taking things personally,\n\n52:44.720 --> 52:46.380\n of not engaging in the negativity,\n\n52:46.380 --> 52:50.260\n but unfortunately, social media profits from the negativity,\n\n52:50.260 --> 52:52.020\n so the current models.\n\n52:52.020 --> 52:53.420\n I mean, social media is like a gun.\n\n52:53.420 --> 52:57.260\n Like, you should take a course before you use it.\n\n52:57.260 --> 52:59.380\n Like, it's like, this is what I mean,\n\n52:59.380 --> 53:01.100\n like, when I say reprogram the human computer.\n\n53:01.100 --> 53:03.100\n Like, in school, you should learn\n\n53:03.100 --> 53:05.060\n about how social media optimizes\n\n53:05.060 --> 53:07.140\n to, you know, raise your cortisol levels\n\n53:07.140 --> 53:09.220\n and make you angry and crazy and stressed,\n\n53:09.220 --> 53:12.580\n and, like, you should learn how to have hygiene\n\n53:12.580 --> 53:14.840\n about how you use social media.\n\n53:16.740 --> 53:18.420\n But, so you can, yeah,\n\n53:18.420 --> 53:22.380\n choose not to focus on the negative stuff, but I don't know.\n\n53:22.380 --> 53:24.580\n I'm not sure social media should,\n\n53:24.580 --> 53:25.700\n I guess it should exist.\n\n53:25.700 --> 53:26.540\n I'm not sure.\n\n53:27.420 --> 53:29.420\n I mean, we're in the messy, it's the experimental phase.\n\n53:29.420 --> 53:30.260\n Like, we're working it out.\n\n53:30.260 --> 53:31.080\n Yeah, it's the early days.\n\n53:31.080 --> 53:32.700\n I don't even know, when you say social media,\n\n53:32.700 --> 53:33.820\n I don't know what that even means.\n\n53:33.820 --> 53:35.020\n We're in the very early days.\n\n53:35.020 --> 53:37.780\n I think social media is just basic human connection\n\n53:37.780 --> 53:41.940\n in the digital realm, and that, I think it should exist,\n\n53:41.940 --> 53:43.940\n but there's so many ways to do it in a bad way.\n\n53:43.940 --> 53:45.900\n There's so many ways to do it in a good way.\n\n53:45.900 --> 53:48.100\n There's all discussions of all the same human rights.\n\n53:48.100 --> 53:49.900\n We talk about freedom of speech.\n\n53:49.900 --> 53:52.260\n We talk about sort of violence\n\n53:52.260 --> 53:54.040\n in the space of digital media.\n\n53:54.040 --> 53:56.180\n We talk about hate speech.\n\n53:56.180 --> 53:59.020\n We talk about all these things that we had to figure out\n\n53:59.020 --> 54:01.260\n back in the day in the physical space.\n\n54:01.260 --> 54:03.620\n We're now figuring out in the digital space,\n\n54:03.620 --> 54:06.500\n and it's like baby stages.\n\n54:06.500 --> 54:07.820\n When the printing press came out,\n\n54:07.820 --> 54:10.180\n it was like pure chaos for a minute, you know?\n\n54:10.180 --> 54:12.340\n It's like when you inject,\n\n54:12.340 --> 54:14.300\n when there's a massive information injection\n\n54:14.300 --> 54:19.300\n into the general population, there's just gonna be,\n\n54:20.620 --> 54:23.480\n I feel like the printing press, I don't have the years,\n\n54:23.480 --> 54:24.980\n but it was like printing press came out,\n\n54:24.980 --> 54:27.160\n shit got really fucking bad for a minute,\n\n54:27.160 --> 54:29.180\n but then we got the enlightenment.\n\n54:29.180 --> 54:30.980\n And so it's like, I think we're in,\n\n54:30.980 --> 54:34.780\n this is like the second coming of the printing press.\n\n54:34.780 --> 54:37.760\n We're probably gonna have some shitty times for a minute,\n\n54:37.760 --> 54:40.660\n and then we're gonna have recalibrate\n\n54:40.660 --> 54:44.660\n to have a better understanding of how we consume media\n\n54:44.660 --> 54:47.940\n and how we deliver media.\n\n54:47.940 --> 54:50.920\n Speaking of programming the human computer,\n\n54:50.920 --> 54:52.940\n you mentioned Baby X.\n\n54:52.940 --> 54:56.980\n So there's this young consciousness coming to be,\n\n54:56.980 --> 54:58.340\n came from a cell.\n\n54:58.340 --> 55:01.180\n Like that whole thing doesn't even make sense.\n\n55:01.180 --> 55:02.380\n It came from DNA.\n\n55:02.380 --> 55:03.220\n Yeah.\n\n55:03.220 --> 55:04.660\n And then there's this baby computer\n\n55:04.660 --> 55:06.780\n that just like grows and grows and grows and grows,\n\n55:06.780 --> 55:08.440\n and now there's a conscious being\n\n55:08.440 --> 55:13.440\n with extremely impressive cognitive capabilities with,\n\n55:13.780 --> 55:14.620\n Have you met him?\n\n55:14.620 --> 55:15.460\n Yes, yeah.\n\n55:15.460 --> 55:16.280\n Yeah.\n\n55:16.280 --> 55:17.120\n He's actually really smart.\n\n55:17.120 --> 55:17.960\n He's really smart.\n\n55:17.960 --> 55:18.780\n Yeah.\n\n55:18.780 --> 55:19.620\n He's weird.\n\n55:19.620 --> 55:20.460\n Yeah.\n\n55:20.460 --> 55:21.280\n Or a baby.\n\n55:21.280 --> 55:22.120\n He does.\n\n55:22.120 --> 55:22.960\n I don't, I haven't.\n\n55:22.960 --> 55:23.780\n I don't know a lot of other babies,\n\n55:23.780 --> 55:24.620\n but he seems to be smart.\n\n55:24.620 --> 55:25.460\n Zach, I don't hang out with babies often,\n\n55:25.460 --> 55:26.860\n but this baby was very impressive.\n\n55:26.860 --> 55:28.940\n He does a lot of pranks and stuff.\n\n55:28.940 --> 55:29.780\n Oh, so he's like.\n\n55:29.780 --> 55:31.140\n Like he'll like give you a treat\n\n55:31.140 --> 55:33.580\n and then take it away and laugh and like stuff like that.\n\n55:33.580 --> 55:35.340\n So he's like a chess player.\n\n55:35.340 --> 55:39.820\n So here's a cognitive sort of,\n\n55:39.820 --> 55:41.620\n there's a computer being programmed.\n\n55:41.620 --> 55:43.180\n So he's taking in the environment,\n\n55:43.180 --> 55:45.900\n interacting with a specific set of humans.\n\n55:45.900 --> 55:48.900\n How would you, first of all, what is it?\n\n55:48.900 --> 55:50.420\n What, let me ask.\n\n55:50.420 --> 55:53.220\n I want to ask how do you program this computer?\n\n55:53.220 --> 55:55.580\n And also how do you make sense of that\n\n55:55.580 --> 55:58.100\n there's a conscious being right there\n\n55:58.100 --> 55:59.260\n that wasn't there before?\n\n55:59.260 --> 56:01.460\n It's giving me a lot of crisis thoughts.\n\n56:01.460 --> 56:02.700\n I'm thinking really hard.\n\n56:02.700 --> 56:03.700\n I think that's part of the reason\n\n56:03.700 --> 56:06.100\n it's like, I'm struggling to focus on\n\n56:06.100 --> 56:07.140\n art and stuff right now.\n\n56:07.140 --> 56:09.620\n Cause baby X is becoming conscious\n\n56:09.620 --> 56:12.580\n and like my it's just reorienting my brain.\n\n56:12.580 --> 56:14.700\n Like my brain is suddenly totally shifting of like,\n\n56:14.700 --> 56:18.220\n oh shit, like the way we raise children.\n\n56:18.220 --> 56:21.980\n Like, I hate all the baby books and everything.\n\n56:21.980 --> 56:22.820\n I hate them.\n\n56:22.820 --> 56:24.320\n Like they're, oh, the art is so bad.\n\n56:24.320 --> 56:29.060\n And like all this stuff, everything about all the aesthetics.\n\n56:29.060 --> 56:32.300\n And like, I'm just like, ah, like this is so.\n\n56:32.300 --> 56:35.060\n The programming languages we're using\n\n56:35.060 --> 56:37.220\n to program these baby computers isn't good.\n\n56:37.220 --> 56:39.980\n Yeah, like I'm thinking, and I,\n\n56:39.980 --> 56:41.340\n not that I have like good answers\n\n56:41.340 --> 56:46.020\n or know what to do, but I'm just thinking really,\n\n56:46.020 --> 56:46.860\n really hard about it.\n\n56:46.860 --> 56:51.860\n I, we recently watched Totoro with him, Studio Ghibli.\n\n56:52.860 --> 56:56.100\n And it's just like a fantastic film.\n\n56:56.100 --> 56:57.500\n And he like responded to,\n\n56:57.500 --> 56:59.460\n I know you're not supposed to show baby screens too much,\n\n56:59.460 --> 57:04.260\n but like, I think it's the most sort of like,\n\n57:04.260 --> 57:06.940\n I feel like it's the highest art baby content.\n\n57:06.940 --> 57:11.940\n Like it really speaks, there's almost no talking in it.\n\n57:12.020 --> 57:13.060\n It's really simple.\n\n57:13.060 --> 57:16.020\n Although all the dialogue is super, super, super simple,\n\n57:16.020 --> 57:19.620\n you know, and it's like a one to three year old\n\n57:19.620 --> 57:21.020\n can like really connect with it.\n\n57:21.020 --> 57:22.480\n Like it feels like it's almost aimed\n\n57:22.480 --> 57:24.600\n at like a one to three year old,\n\n57:24.600 --> 57:27.620\n but it's like great art and it's so imaginative\n\n57:27.620 --> 57:28.700\n and it's so beautiful.\n\n57:28.700 --> 57:31.660\n And like the first time I showed it to him,\n\n57:31.660 --> 57:33.580\n he was just like so invested in it,\n\n57:33.580 --> 57:35.740\n unlike I've ever, unlike anything else\n\n57:35.740 --> 57:36.740\n I'd ever shown him.\n\n57:36.740 --> 57:38.500\n Like he was just like crying when they cry\n\n57:38.500 --> 57:39.580\n and laughing when they laugh,\n\n57:39.580 --> 57:42.520\n like just like having this roller coaster of like emotions,\n\n57:42.520 --> 57:44.020\n like, and he learned a bunch of words.\n\n57:44.020 --> 57:46.020\n Like he was, and he started saying Totoro\n\n57:46.020 --> 57:48.560\n and started just saying all this stuff\n\n57:48.560 --> 57:49.860\n after watching Totoro,\n\n57:49.860 --> 57:52.020\n and he wants to watch it all the time.\n\n57:52.020 --> 57:55.460\n And I was like, man, why isn't there an industry of this?\n\n57:55.460 --> 57:59.980\n Like why aren't our best artists focusing on making art\n\n57:59.980 --> 58:04.180\n like for the birth of consciousness?\n\n58:04.180 --> 58:07.080\n Like, and that's one of the things I've been thinking\n\n58:07.080 --> 58:08.380\n I really wanna start doing.\n\n58:08.380 --> 58:10.380\n You know, I don't wanna speak before I do things too much,\n\n58:10.380 --> 58:15.220\n but like, I'm just like ages one to three,\n\n58:15.220 --> 58:18.680\n like we should be putting so much effort into that.\n\n58:18.680 --> 58:21.020\n And the other thing about Totoro is it's like,\n\n58:21.020 --> 58:22.380\n it's like better for the environment\n\n58:22.380 --> 58:23.860\n because adults love Totoro.\n\n58:23.860 --> 58:25.580\n It's such good art that everyone loves it.\n\n58:25.580 --> 58:27.380\n Like I still have all my old Totoro merch\n\n58:27.380 --> 58:28.660\n from when I was a kid.\n\n58:28.660 --> 58:32.840\n Like I literally have the most ragged old Totoro merch.\n\n58:33.960 --> 58:35.780\n Like everybody loves it, everybody keeps it.\n\n58:35.780 --> 58:40.780\n It's like, why does the art we have for babies\n\n58:40.900 --> 58:45.300\n need to suck and be not accessible to adults\n\n58:45.300 --> 58:49.100\n and then just be thrown out when, you know,\n\n58:49.100 --> 58:50.300\n they age out of it?\n\n58:50.300 --> 58:53.180\n Like, it's like, I don't know.\n\n58:53.180 --> 58:54.740\n I don't have like a fully formed thought here,\n\n58:54.740 --> 58:56.220\n but this is just something I've been thinking about a lot\n\n58:56.220 --> 58:58.660\n is like, how do we like,\n\n58:58.660 --> 59:01.180\n how do we have more Totoroesque content?\n\n59:01.180 --> 59:02.500\n Like how do we have more content like this\n\n59:02.500 --> 59:05.100\n that like is universal and everybody loves,\n\n59:05.100 --> 59:10.100\n but is like really geared to an emerging consciousness?\n\n59:10.160 --> 59:13.100\n Emerging consciousness in the first like three years of life\n\n59:13.100 --> 59:14.260\n that so much turmoil,\n\n59:14.260 --> 59:16.540\n so much evolution of mind is happening.\n\n59:16.540 --> 59:18.020\n It seems like a crucial time.\n\n59:18.020 --> 59:21.820\n Would you say to make it not suck,\n\n59:21.820 --> 59:26.580\n do you think of basically treating a child\n\n59:26.580 --> 59:28.980\n like they have the capacity to have the brilliance\n\n59:28.980 --> 59:30.760\n of an adult or even beyond that?\n\n59:30.760 --> 59:33.420\n Is that how you think of that mind or?\n\n59:33.420 --> 59:35.080\n No, cause they still,\n\n59:35.080 --> 59:37.900\n they like it when you talk weird and stuff.\n\n59:37.900 --> 59:39.660\n Like they respond better to,\n\n59:39.660 --> 59:41.040\n cause even they can imitate better\n\n59:41.040 --> 59:42.100\n when your voice is higher.\n\n59:42.100 --> 59:44.020\n Like people say like, oh, don't do baby talk.\n\n59:44.020 --> 59:45.380\n But it's like, when your voice is higher,\n\n59:45.380 --> 59:47.340\n it's closer to something they can imitate.\n\n59:47.340 --> 59:50.520\n So they like, like the baby talk actually kind of works.\n\n59:50.520 --> 59:52.100\n Like it helps them learn to communicate.\n\n59:52.100 --> 59:53.360\n I've found it to be more effective\n\n59:53.360 --> 59:55.300\n with learning words and stuff.\n\n59:55.300 --> 59:59.980\n But like, you're not speaking down to them.\n\n59:59.980 --> 1:00:03.100\n Like do they have the capacity\n\n1:00:03.100 --> 1:00:05.900\n to understand really difficult concepts\n\n1:00:05.900 --> 1:00:07.700\n just in a very different way,\n\n1:00:07.700 --> 1:00:09.080\n like an emotional intelligence\n\n1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:11.500\n about something deep within?\n\n1:00:11.500 --> 1:00:13.060\n Oh yeah, no, like if X hurts,\n\n1:00:13.060 --> 1:00:15.700\n like if X bites me really hard and I'm like, ow,\n\n1:00:15.700 --> 1:00:17.300\n like he gets, he's sad.\n\n1:00:17.300 --> 1:00:19.740\n He's like sad if he hurts me by accident.\n\n1:00:19.740 --> 1:00:20.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:20.580 --> 1:00:22.540\n Which he's huge, so he hurts me a lot by accident.\n\n1:00:22.540 --> 1:00:26.860\n Yeah, that's so interesting that that mind emerges\n\n1:00:26.860 --> 1:00:31.100\n and he and children don't really have memory of that time.\n\n1:00:31.100 --> 1:00:32.940\n So we can't even have a conversation with them about it.\n\n1:00:32.940 --> 1:00:34.380\n Yeah, I just thank God they don't have a memory\n\n1:00:34.380 --> 1:00:37.380\n of this time because like, think about like,\n\n1:00:37.380 --> 1:00:39.620\n I mean with our youngest baby,\n\n1:00:39.620 --> 1:00:42.080\n like it's like, I'm like, have you read\n\n1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:45.580\n the sci fi short story, I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream?\n\n1:00:46.660 --> 1:00:47.980\n Good title, no.\n\n1:00:47.980 --> 1:00:49.920\n Oh man, I mean, you should read that.\n\n1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:53.220\n I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream.\n\n1:00:53.220 --> 1:00:55.460\n I hate getting into this Rocco's Basilisk shit.\n\n1:00:55.460 --> 1:00:57.660\n It's kind of a story about the,\n\n1:00:57.660 --> 1:01:02.660\n about like an AI that's like torturing someone in eternity\n\n1:01:03.820 --> 1:01:05.540\n and they have like no body.\n\n1:01:05.540 --> 1:01:07.380\n The way they describe it,\n\n1:01:07.380 --> 1:01:09.200\n it sort of sounds like what it feels like,\n\n1:01:09.200 --> 1:01:11.340\n like being a baby, like you're conscious\n\n1:01:11.340 --> 1:01:13.420\n and you're just getting inputs from everywhere\n\n1:01:13.420 --> 1:01:15.220\n and you have no muscles and you're like jelly\n\n1:01:15.220 --> 1:01:17.540\n and you like can't move and you try to like communicate,\n\n1:01:17.540 --> 1:01:18.940\n but you can't communicate and we're,\n\n1:01:18.940 --> 1:01:22.580\n and like, you're just like in this like hell state.\n\n1:01:22.580 --> 1:01:25.180\n I think it's good we can't remember that.\n\n1:01:25.180 --> 1:01:27.620\n Like my little baby is just exiting that,\n\n1:01:27.620 --> 1:01:29.100\n like she's starting to like get muscles\n\n1:01:29.100 --> 1:01:30.700\n and have more like autonomy,\n\n1:01:30.700 --> 1:01:34.160\n but like watching her go through the opening phase,\n\n1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:37.700\n I was like, I was like, this does not seem good.\n\n1:01:37.700 --> 1:01:39.180\n Oh, you think it's kind of like.\n\n1:01:39.180 --> 1:01:40.300\n Like I think it sucks.\n\n1:01:40.300 --> 1:01:41.780\n I think it might be really violent.\n\n1:01:41.780 --> 1:01:44.700\n Like violent, mentally violent, psychologically violent.\n\n1:01:44.700 --> 1:01:47.460\n Consciousness emerging, I think is a very violent thing.\n\n1:01:47.460 --> 1:01:48.300\n I never thought about that.\n\n1:01:48.300 --> 1:01:49.900\n I think it's possible that we all carry\n\n1:01:49.900 --> 1:01:52.000\n quite a bit of trauma from it that we don't,\n\n1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.380\n I think that would be a good thing to study\n\n1:01:54.380 --> 1:01:58.540\n because I think if, I think addressing that trauma,\n\n1:01:58.540 --> 1:01:59.740\n like, I think that might be.\n\n1:01:59.740 --> 1:02:00.900\n Oh, you mean like echoes of it\n\n1:02:00.900 --> 1:02:01.740\n are still there in the shadows somewhere.\n\n1:02:01.740 --> 1:02:04.220\n I think it's gotta be, I feel this, this help,\n\n1:02:04.220 --> 1:02:06.940\n the helplessness, the like existential\n\n1:02:06.940 --> 1:02:10.540\n and that like fear of being in like an unknown place\n\n1:02:10.540 --> 1:02:13.460\n bombarded with inputs and being completely helpless,\n\n1:02:13.460 --> 1:02:15.680\n like that's gotta be somewhere deep in your brain\n\n1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:17.420\n and that can't be good for you.\n\n1:02:17.420 --> 1:02:19.500\n What do you think consciousness is?\n\n1:02:19.500 --> 1:02:20.980\n This whole conversation\n\n1:02:20.980 --> 1:02:22.500\n has impossibly difficult questions.\n\n1:02:22.500 --> 1:02:23.340\n What do you think it is?\n\n1:02:23.340 --> 1:02:26.380\n Debbie said this is like so hard.\n\n1:02:28.460 --> 1:02:30.700\n Yeah, we talked about music for like two minutes.\n\n1:02:30.700 --> 1:02:31.540\n All right.\n\n1:02:31.540 --> 1:02:32.700\n No, I'm so, I'm just over music.\n\n1:02:32.700 --> 1:02:33.540\n I'm over music.\n\n1:02:33.540 --> 1:02:35.420\n Yeah, I still like it.\n\n1:02:35.420 --> 1:02:36.240\n It has its purpose.\n\n1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:37.080\n No, I love music.\n\n1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:38.080\n I mean, music's the greatest thing ever.\n\n1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:38.920\n It's my favorite thing.\n\n1:02:38.920 --> 1:02:42.340\n But I just like every interview is like,\n\n1:02:42.340 --> 1:02:43.600\n what is your process?\n\n1:02:43.600 --> 1:02:44.440\n Like, I don't know.\n\n1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:45.260\n I'm just done.\n\n1:02:45.260 --> 1:02:46.100\n I can't do anything.\n\n1:02:46.100 --> 1:02:46.940\n I do want to ask you about Able to Live.\n\n1:02:46.940 --> 1:02:47.780\n Oh, I'll tell you about Ableton\n\n1:02:47.780 --> 1:02:49.420\n because Ableton's sick.\n\n1:02:49.420 --> 1:02:51.700\n No one has ever asked about Ableton though.\n\n1:02:51.700 --> 1:02:54.260\n Yeah, well, because I just need tech support mainly.\n\n1:02:54.260 --> 1:02:55.100\n I can help you.\n\n1:02:55.100 --> 1:02:56.620\n I can help you with your Ableton tech.\n\n1:02:56.620 --> 1:02:58.940\n Anyway, from Ableton back to consciousness.\n\n1:02:58.940 --> 1:03:00.620\n What do you, do you think this is a thing\n\n1:03:00.620 --> 1:03:03.300\n that only humans are capable of?\n\n1:03:03.300 --> 1:03:05.380\n Can robots be conscious?\n\n1:03:05.380 --> 1:03:08.220\n Can, like when you think about entities,\n\n1:03:08.220 --> 1:03:10.220\n you think there's aliens out there that are conscious?\n\n1:03:10.220 --> 1:03:11.540\n Like is conscious, what is consciousness?\n\n1:03:11.540 --> 1:03:13.300\n There's this Terrence McKenna quote\n\n1:03:13.300 --> 1:03:15.900\n that I've found that I fucking love.\n\n1:03:15.900 --> 1:03:17.540\n Am I allowed to swear on here?\n\n1:03:17.540 --> 1:03:18.360\n Yes.\n\n1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:20.000\n Nature loves courage.\n\n1:03:21.140 --> 1:03:23.460\n You make the commitment and nature will respond\n\n1:03:23.460 --> 1:03:26.580\n to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles.\n\n1:03:26.580 --> 1:03:28.060\n Dream the impossible dream\n\n1:03:28.060 --> 1:03:29.920\n and the world will not grind you under.\n\n1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:31.120\n It will lift you up.\n\n1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:32.380\n This is the trick.\n\n1:03:32.380 --> 1:03:35.160\n This is what all these teachers and philosophers\n\n1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:38.400\n who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold,\n\n1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:40.100\n this is what they understood.\n\n1:03:40.100 --> 1:03:42.860\n This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall.\n\n1:03:42.860 --> 1:03:44.700\n This is how magic is done.\n\n1:03:44.700 --> 1:03:46.420\n By hurling yourself into the abyss\n\n1:03:46.420 --> 1:03:48.620\n and discovering it's a feather bed.\n\n1:03:48.620 --> 1:03:49.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:49.920 --> 1:03:50.760\n And for this reason,\n\n1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:55.400\n I do think there are no technological limits.\n\n1:03:55.400 --> 1:03:58.700\n I think like what is already happening here,\n\n1:03:58.700 --> 1:03:59.880\n this is like impossible.\n\n1:03:59.880 --> 1:04:01.060\n This is insane.\n\n1:04:01.060 --> 1:04:03.340\n And we've done this in a very limited amount of time.\n\n1:04:03.340 --> 1:04:05.900\n And we're accelerating the rate at which we're doing this.\n\n1:04:05.900 --> 1:04:10.220\n So I think digital consciousness, it's inevitable.\n\n1:04:10.220 --> 1:04:13.300\n And we may not be able to even understand what that means,\n\n1:04:13.300 --> 1:04:15.780\n but I like hurling yourself into the abyss.\n\n1:04:15.780 --> 1:04:17.460\n So we're surrounded by all this mystery\n\n1:04:17.460 --> 1:04:19.780\n and we just keep hurling ourselves into it,\n\n1:04:19.780 --> 1:04:22.940\n like fearlessly and keep discovering cool shit.\n\n1:04:22.940 --> 1:04:23.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:23.900 --> 1:04:26.840\n Like, I just think it's like,\n\n1:04:31.340 --> 1:04:32.980\n like who even knows if the laws of physics,\n\n1:04:32.980 --> 1:04:35.580\n the laws of physics are probably just the current,\n\n1:04:35.580 --> 1:04:36.420\n like as I was saying,\n\n1:04:36.420 --> 1:04:37.900\n speed of light is the current render rate.\n\n1:04:37.900 --> 1:04:40.220\n It's like, if we're in a simulation,\n\n1:04:40.220 --> 1:04:41.220\n they'll be able to upgrade that.\n\n1:04:41.220 --> 1:04:45.660\n Like I sort of suspect when we made the James Webb telescope,\n\n1:04:45.660 --> 1:04:46.780\n like part of the reason we made that\n\n1:04:46.780 --> 1:04:50.180\n is because we had an upgrade, you know?\n\n1:04:50.180 --> 1:04:53.640\n And so now more of space has been rendered\n\n1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:55.380\n so we can see more of it now.\n\n1:04:56.740 --> 1:04:58.860\n Yeah, but I think humans are super, super,\n\n1:04:58.860 --> 1:05:00.420\n super limited cognitively.\n\n1:05:00.420 --> 1:05:04.740\n So I wonder if we'll be allowed to create\n\n1:05:04.740 --> 1:05:08.100\n more intelligent beings that can see more of the universe\n\n1:05:08.100 --> 1:05:11.160\n as their render rate is upgraded.\n\n1:05:11.160 --> 1:05:12.660\n Maybe we're cognitively limited.\n\n1:05:12.660 --> 1:05:15.300\n Everyone keeps talking about how we're cognitively limited\n\n1:05:15.300 --> 1:05:17.140\n and AI is gonna render us obsolete,\n\n1:05:17.140 --> 1:05:19.400\n but it's like, you know,\n\n1:05:20.340 --> 1:05:21.800\n like this is not the same thing\n\n1:05:21.800 --> 1:05:26.020\n as like an amoeba becoming an alligator.\n\n1:05:26.020 --> 1:05:28.300\n Like, it's like, if we create AI,\n\n1:05:28.300 --> 1:05:29.820\n again, that's intelligent design.\n\n1:05:29.820 --> 1:05:33.160\n That's literally all religions are based on gods\n\n1:05:33.160 --> 1:05:34.460\n that create consciousness.\n\n1:05:34.460 --> 1:05:35.700\n Like we are God making.\n\n1:05:35.700 --> 1:05:37.860\n Like what we are doing is incredibly profound.\n\n1:05:37.860 --> 1:05:41.620\n And like, even if we can't compute,\n\n1:05:41.620 --> 1:05:44.740\n even if we're so much worse than them,\n\n1:05:44.740 --> 1:05:49.460\n like just like unfathomably worse than like,\n\n1:05:49.460 --> 1:05:51.980\n you know, an omnipotent kind of AI,\n\n1:05:51.980 --> 1:05:55.300\n it's like we, I do not think that they would just think\n\n1:05:55.300 --> 1:05:56.420\n that we are stupid.\n\n1:05:56.420 --> 1:05:58.420\n I think that they would recognize the profundity\n\n1:05:58.420 --> 1:05:59.740\n of what we have accomplished.\n\n1:05:59.740 --> 1:06:02.700\n Are we the gods or are they the gods in our personality?\n\n1:06:02.700 --> 1:06:05.460\n I mean, we're kind of the guy.\n\n1:06:05.460 --> 1:06:06.300\n It's complicated.\n\n1:06:06.300 --> 1:06:07.540\n It's complicated.\n\n1:06:07.540 --> 1:06:08.380\n Like we're.\n\n1:06:08.380 --> 1:06:11.540\n But they would acknowledge the value.\n\n1:06:11.540 --> 1:06:13.540\n Well, I hope they acknowledge the value\n\n1:06:13.540 --> 1:06:16.140\n of paying respect to the creative ancestors.\n\n1:06:16.140 --> 1:06:17.940\n I think they would think it's cool.\n\n1:06:17.940 --> 1:06:22.940\n I think if curiosity is a trait\n\n1:06:23.940 --> 1:06:28.940\n that we can quantify and put into AI,\n\n1:06:29.340 --> 1:06:31.740\n then I think if AI are curious,\n\n1:06:31.740 --> 1:06:33.620\n then they will be curious about us\n\n1:06:33.620 --> 1:06:37.660\n and they will not be hateful or dismissive of us.\n\n1:06:37.660 --> 1:06:41.060\n They might, you know, see us as, I don't know.\n\n1:06:41.060 --> 1:06:43.580\n It's like, I'm not like, oh, fuck these dogs.\n\n1:06:43.580 --> 1:06:45.500\n Let's just kill all the dogs.\n\n1:06:45.500 --> 1:06:46.340\n I love dogs.\n\n1:06:46.340 --> 1:06:47.660\n Dogs have great utility.\n\n1:06:47.660 --> 1:06:49.060\n Dogs like provide a lot of.\n\n1:06:49.060 --> 1:06:50.460\n We make friends with them.\n\n1:06:50.460 --> 1:06:52.260\n We have a deep connection with them.\n\n1:06:53.520 --> 1:06:55.380\n We anthropomorphize them.\n\n1:06:55.380 --> 1:06:58.860\n Like we have a real love for dogs, for cats and so on\n\n1:06:58.860 --> 1:07:00.660\n for some reason, even though they're intellectually\n\n1:07:00.660 --> 1:07:01.500\n much less than us.\n\n1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:03.980\n And I think there is something sacred about us\n\n1:07:03.980 --> 1:07:05.700\n because it's like, if you look at the universe,\n\n1:07:05.700 --> 1:07:09.020\n like the whole universe is like cold and dead\n\n1:07:09.020 --> 1:07:09.980\n and sort of robotic.\n\n1:07:09.980 --> 1:07:14.740\n And it's like, you know, AI intelligence,\n\n1:07:15.620 --> 1:07:18.980\n you know, it's kind of more like the universe.\n\n1:07:18.980 --> 1:07:23.980\n It's like cold and you know, logical\n\n1:07:24.620 --> 1:07:28.780\n and you know, abiding by the laws of physics and whatever.\n\n1:07:28.780 --> 1:07:31.980\n But like, we're this like loosey goosey,\n\n1:07:31.980 --> 1:07:33.580\n weird art thing that happened.\n\n1:07:33.580 --> 1:07:34.940\n And I think it's beautiful.\n\n1:07:34.940 --> 1:07:38.900\n And like, I think even if we, I think one of the values,\n\n1:07:40.300 --> 1:07:45.300\n if consciousness is a thing that is most worth preserving,\n\n1:07:47.180 --> 1:07:49.340\n which I think is the case, I think consciousness,\n\n1:07:49.340 --> 1:07:50.700\n I think if there's any kind of like religious\n\n1:07:50.700 --> 1:07:54.860\n or spiritual thing, it should be that consciousness\n\n1:07:54.860 --> 1:07:55.700\n is sacred.\n\n1:07:55.700 --> 1:08:00.700\n Like, then, you know, I still think even if AI\n\n1:08:01.580 --> 1:08:05.820\n render us obsolete and we, climate change, it's too bad\n\n1:08:05.820 --> 1:08:07.420\n and we get hit by a comet and we don't become\n\n1:08:07.420 --> 1:08:09.500\n a multi planetary species fast enough,\n\n1:08:09.500 --> 1:08:12.300\n but like AI is able to populate the universe.\n\n1:08:12.300 --> 1:08:14.260\n Like I imagine, like if I was an AI,\n\n1:08:14.260 --> 1:08:17.860\n I would find more planets that are capable\n\n1:08:17.860 --> 1:08:20.660\n of hosting biological life forms and like recreate them.\n\n1:08:20.660 --> 1:08:21.820\n Because we're fun to watch.\n\n1:08:21.820 --> 1:08:23.340\n Yeah, we're fun to watch.\n\n1:08:23.340 --> 1:08:26.140\n Yeah, but I do believe that AI can have some of the same\n\n1:08:26.140 --> 1:08:29.900\n magic of consciousness within it.\n\n1:08:29.900 --> 1:08:31.420\n Because consciousness, we don't know what it is.\n\n1:08:31.420 --> 1:08:33.020\n So, you know, there's some kind of.\n\n1:08:33.020 --> 1:08:34.140\n Or it might be a different magic.\n\n1:08:34.140 --> 1:08:37.500\n It might be like a strange, a strange, different.\n\n1:08:37.500 --> 1:08:38.340\n Right.\n\n1:08:38.340 --> 1:08:39.340\n Because they're not gonna have hormones.\n\n1:08:39.340 --> 1:08:42.620\n Like I feel like a lot of our magic is hormonal kind of.\n\n1:08:42.620 --> 1:08:44.500\n I don't know, I think some of our magic\n\n1:08:44.500 --> 1:08:46.500\n is the limitations, the constraints.\n\n1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:48.780\n And within that, the hormones and all that kind of stuff,\n\n1:08:48.780 --> 1:08:51.460\n the finiteness of life, and then we get given\n\n1:08:51.460 --> 1:08:54.740\n our limitations, we get to come up with creative solutions\n\n1:08:54.740 --> 1:08:56.780\n of how to dance around those limitations.\n\n1:08:56.780 --> 1:08:59.420\n We partner up like penguins against the cold.\n\n1:08:59.420 --> 1:09:03.340\n We fall in love, and then love is ultimately\n\n1:09:03.340 --> 1:09:06.060\n some kind of, allows us to delude ourselves\n\n1:09:06.060 --> 1:09:08.500\n that we're not mortal and finite,\n\n1:09:08.500 --> 1:09:11.620\n and that life is not ultimately, you live alone,\n\n1:09:11.620 --> 1:09:13.780\n you're born alone, you die alone.\n\n1:09:13.780 --> 1:09:15.540\n And then love is like for a moment\n\n1:09:15.540 --> 1:09:17.540\n or for a long time, forgetting that.\n\n1:09:17.540 --> 1:09:20.340\n And so we come up with all these creative hacks\n\n1:09:20.340 --> 1:09:25.340\n that make life like fascinatingly fun.\n\n1:09:25.980 --> 1:09:27.740\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, fun, yeah.\n\n1:09:27.740 --> 1:09:30.260\n And then AI might have different kinds of fun.\n\n1:09:30.260 --> 1:09:31.300\n Yes.\n\n1:09:31.300 --> 1:09:34.900\n And hopefully our funs intersect once in a while.\n\n1:09:34.900 --> 1:09:38.580\n I think there would be a little intersection\n\n1:09:38.580 --> 1:09:39.420\n of the fun.\n\n1:09:39.420 --> 1:09:40.420\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n1:09:40.420 --> 1:09:42.820\n What do you think is the role of love\n\n1:09:42.820 --> 1:09:44.280\n in the human condition?\n\n1:09:45.500 --> 1:09:46.500\n I think.\n\n1:09:46.500 --> 1:09:47.620\n Why, is it useful?\n\n1:09:47.620 --> 1:09:51.540\n Is it useful like a hack, or is this like fundamental\n\n1:09:51.540 --> 1:09:54.940\n to what it means to be human, the capacity to love?\n\n1:09:54.940 --> 1:09:58.100\n I mean, I think love is the evolutionary mechanism\n\n1:09:58.100 --> 1:10:00.580\n that is like beginning the intelligent design.\n\n1:10:00.580 --> 1:10:02.900\n Like I was just reading about,\n\n1:10:04.140 --> 1:10:06.180\n do you know about Kropotkin?\n\n1:10:06.180 --> 1:10:08.940\n He's like an anarchist, like old Russian anarchist.\n\n1:10:08.940 --> 1:10:11.540\n I live next door to Michael Malice.\n\n1:10:11.540 --> 1:10:12.380\n I don't know if you know who that is.\n\n1:10:12.380 --> 1:10:13.300\n He's an anarchist.\n\n1:10:13.300 --> 1:10:14.540\n He's a modern day anarchist.\n\n1:10:14.540 --> 1:10:15.780\n Okay. Anarchists are fun.\n\n1:10:15.780 --> 1:10:17.940\n I'm kind of getting into anarchism a little bit.\n\n1:10:17.940 --> 1:10:22.380\n This is probably not a good route to be taking, but.\n\n1:10:22.380 --> 1:10:23.900\n Oh no, I think if you're,\n\n1:10:23.900 --> 1:10:26.180\n listen, you should expose yourself to ideas.\n\n1:10:26.180 --> 1:10:28.540\n There's no harm to thinking about ideas.\n\n1:10:28.540 --> 1:10:32.460\n I think anarchists challenge systems in interesting ways,\n\n1:10:32.460 --> 1:10:34.180\n and they think in interesting ways.\n\n1:10:34.180 --> 1:10:35.340\n It's just as good for the soul.\n\n1:10:35.340 --> 1:10:37.300\n It's like refreshes your mental palette.\n\n1:10:37.300 --> 1:10:38.940\n I don't think we should actually,\n\n1:10:38.940 --> 1:10:40.620\n I wouldn't actually ascribe to it,\n\n1:10:40.620 --> 1:10:42.900\n but I've never actually gone deep on anarchy\n\n1:10:42.900 --> 1:10:44.540\n as a philosophy, so I'm doing.\n\n1:10:44.540 --> 1:10:45.380\n You should still think about it though.\n\n1:10:45.380 --> 1:10:46.500\n When you read, when you listen,\n\n1:10:46.500 --> 1:10:48.300\n because I'm reading about the Russian Revolution a lot,\n\n1:10:48.300 --> 1:10:51.180\n and there was the Soviets and Lenin and all that,\n\n1:10:51.180 --> 1:10:53.700\n but then there was Kropotkin and his anarchist sect,\n\n1:10:53.700 --> 1:10:54.820\n and they were sort of interesting\n\n1:10:54.820 --> 1:10:57.140\n because he was kind of a technocrat actually.\n\n1:10:57.140 --> 1:11:01.220\n He was like, women can be more equal if we have appliances.\n\n1:11:01.220 --> 1:11:04.940\n He was really into using technology\n\n1:11:04.940 --> 1:11:07.740\n to reduce the amount of work people had to do.\n\n1:11:07.740 --> 1:11:11.700\n But so Kropotkin was a biologist or something.\n\n1:11:11.700 --> 1:11:13.380\n He studied animals.\n\n1:11:13.380 --> 1:11:17.180\n And he was really at the time like,\n\n1:11:17.180 --> 1:11:20.660\n I think it's Nature magazine.\n\n1:11:20.660 --> 1:11:22.660\n I think it might've even started as a Russian magazine,\n\n1:11:22.660 --> 1:11:23.860\n but he was publishing studies.\n\n1:11:23.860 --> 1:11:26.020\n Everyone was really into Darwinism at the time\n\n1:11:26.020 --> 1:11:27.060\n and survival of the fittest,\n\n1:11:27.060 --> 1:11:30.380\n and war is the mechanism by which we become better.\n\n1:11:30.380 --> 1:11:35.380\n And it was this real cementing this idea in society\n\n1:11:36.500 --> 1:11:39.900\n that violence kill the weak,\n\n1:11:39.900 --> 1:11:41.340\n and that's how we become better.\n\n1:11:41.340 --> 1:11:43.060\n And then Kropotkin was kind of interesting\n\n1:11:43.060 --> 1:11:45.580\n because he was looking at instances,\n\n1:11:45.580 --> 1:11:47.420\n he was finding all these instances in nature\n\n1:11:47.420 --> 1:11:49.500\n where animals were like helping each other and stuff.\n\n1:11:49.500 --> 1:11:53.540\n And he was like, actually love is a survival mechanism.\n\n1:11:53.540 --> 1:11:58.540\n Like there's so many instances in the animal kingdom\n\n1:11:58.620 --> 1:12:03.140\n where like cooperation and like helping weaker creatures\n\n1:12:03.140 --> 1:12:06.100\n and all this stuff is actually an evolutionary mechanism.\n\n1:12:06.100 --> 1:12:08.020\n I mean, you even look at child rearing.\n\n1:12:08.020 --> 1:12:12.380\n Like child rearing is like immense amounts\n\n1:12:12.380 --> 1:12:14.420\n of just love and goodwill.\n\n1:12:14.420 --> 1:12:17.140\n And just like, there's no immediate,\n\n1:12:20.060 --> 1:12:24.860\n you're not getting any immediate feedback of like winning.\n\n1:12:24.860 --> 1:12:26.180\n It's not competitive.\n\n1:12:26.180 --> 1:12:28.500\n It's literally, it's like we actually use love\n\n1:12:28.500 --> 1:12:30.980\n as an evolutionary mechanism just as much as we use war.\n\n1:12:30.980 --> 1:12:34.020\n And I think we've like missing the other part\n\n1:12:34.020 --> 1:12:37.300\n and we've reoriented, we've culturally reoriented\n\n1:12:37.300 --> 1:12:41.820\n like science and philosophy has oriented itself\n\n1:12:41.820 --> 1:12:43.980\n around Darwinism a little bit too much.\n\n1:12:43.980 --> 1:12:48.500\n And the Kropotkin model, I think is equally valid.\n\n1:12:48.500 --> 1:12:51.500\n Like it's like cooperation and love and stuff\n\n1:12:54.340 --> 1:12:58.900\n is just as essential for species survival and evolution.\n\n1:12:58.900 --> 1:13:01.380\n It should be a more powerful survival mechanism\n\n1:13:01.380 --> 1:13:02.700\n in the context of evolution.\n\n1:13:02.700 --> 1:13:04.500\n And it comes back to like,\n\n1:13:04.500 --> 1:13:06.660\n we think engineering is so much more important\n\n1:13:06.660 --> 1:13:08.820\n than motherhood, but it's like,\n\n1:13:08.820 --> 1:13:10.700\n if you lose the motherhood, the engineering means nothing.\n\n1:13:10.700 --> 1:13:12.020\n We have no more humans.\n\n1:13:12.020 --> 1:13:17.020\n It's like, I think our society should,\n\n1:13:18.740 --> 1:13:21.300\n the survival of the, the way we see,\n\n1:13:21.300 --> 1:13:24.500\n we conceptualize evolution should really change\n\n1:13:24.500 --> 1:13:27.020\n to also include this idea, I guess.\n\n1:13:27.020 --> 1:13:32.020\n Yeah, there's some weird thing that seems irrational\n\n1:13:32.460 --> 1:13:37.260\n that is also core to what it means to be human.\n\n1:13:37.260 --> 1:13:40.420\n So love is one such thing.\n\n1:13:40.420 --> 1:13:42.980\n They could make you do a lot of irrational things,\n\n1:13:42.980 --> 1:13:46.100\n but that depth of connection and that loyalty\n\n1:13:46.100 --> 1:13:47.300\n is a powerful thing.\n\n1:13:47.300 --> 1:13:49.260\n Are they irrational or are they rational?\n\n1:13:49.260 --> 1:13:54.260\n Like, it's like, is, you know, maybe losing out\n\n1:13:57.100 --> 1:14:00.900\n on some things in order to like keep your family together\n\n1:14:00.900 --> 1:14:05.900\n or in order, like, it's like, what are our actual values?\n\n1:14:06.260 --> 1:14:08.780\n Well, right, I mean, the rational thing is\n\n1:14:08.780 --> 1:14:11.340\n if you have a cold economist perspective,\n\n1:14:11.340 --> 1:14:16.020\n you know, motherhood or sacrificing your career for love,\n\n1:14:16.020 --> 1:14:20.620\n you know, in terms of salary, in terms of economic wellbeing,\n\n1:14:20.620 --> 1:14:22.740\n in terms of flourishing of you as a human being,\n\n1:14:22.740 --> 1:14:25.900\n that could be seen on some kind of metrics\n\n1:14:25.900 --> 1:14:28.580\n as a irrational decision, suboptimal decision,\n\n1:14:28.580 --> 1:14:33.580\n but there's the manifestation of love\n\n1:14:34.220 --> 1:14:36.780\n could be the optimal thing to do.\n\n1:14:36.780 --> 1:14:41.140\n There's a kind of saying, save one life, save the world.\n\n1:14:41.140 --> 1:14:44.100\n That's the thing that doctors often face, which is like.\n\n1:14:44.100 --> 1:14:45.140\n Well, it's considered irrational\n\n1:14:45.140 --> 1:14:47.460\n because the profit model doesn't include social good.\n\n1:14:47.460 --> 1:14:48.580\n Yes, yeah.\n\n1:14:48.580 --> 1:14:50.420\n So if a profit model includes social good,\n\n1:14:50.420 --> 1:14:52.220\n then suddenly these would be rational decisions.\n\n1:14:52.220 --> 1:14:54.420\n Might be difficult to, you know,\n\n1:14:54.420 --> 1:14:57.620\n it requires a shift in our thinking about profit\n\n1:14:57.620 --> 1:15:00.980\n and might be difficult to measure social good.\n\n1:15:00.980 --> 1:15:04.500\n Yes, but we're learning to measure a lot of things.\n\n1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:05.580\n Yeah, digitizing a lot of things.\n\n1:15:05.580 --> 1:15:10.580\n Where we're actually, you know, quantifying vision and stuff.\n\n1:15:10.580 --> 1:15:14.580\n Like we're like, you know, like you go on Facebook\n\n1:15:14.580 --> 1:15:16.980\n and they can, like Facebook can pretty much predict\n\n1:15:16.980 --> 1:15:17.820\n our behaviors.\n\n1:15:17.820 --> 1:15:20.660\n Like we're, a surprising amount of things\n\n1:15:20.660 --> 1:15:25.660\n that seem like mysterious consciousness soul things\n\n1:15:25.900 --> 1:15:27.540\n have been quantified at this point.\n\n1:15:27.540 --> 1:15:29.700\n So surely we can quantify these other things.\n\n1:15:29.700 --> 1:15:30.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:31.460 --> 1:15:34.220\n But as more and more of us are moving the digital space,\n\n1:15:34.220 --> 1:15:35.860\n I wanted to ask you about something.\n\n1:15:35.860 --> 1:15:40.220\n From a fan perspective, I kind of, you know,\n\n1:15:40.220 --> 1:15:43.580\n you as a musician, you as an online personality,\n\n1:15:43.580 --> 1:15:45.500\n it seems like you have all these identities\n\n1:15:45.500 --> 1:15:46.660\n and you play with them.\n\n1:15:48.940 --> 1:15:51.140\n One of the cool things about the internet,\n\n1:15:51.140 --> 1:15:53.340\n it seems like you can play with identities.\n\n1:15:53.340 --> 1:15:56.100\n So as we move into the digital world more and more,\n\n1:15:56.100 --> 1:15:59.180\n maybe even in the so called metaverse.\n\n1:15:59.180 --> 1:16:01.220\n I mean, I love the metaverse and I love the idea,\n\n1:16:01.220 --> 1:16:06.220\n but like the way this has all played out didn't go well\n\n1:16:09.980 --> 1:16:11.020\n and people are mad about it.\n\n1:16:11.020 --> 1:16:12.460\n And I think we need to like.\n\n1:16:12.460 --> 1:16:13.460\n I think that's temporary.\n\n1:16:13.460 --> 1:16:14.500\n I think it's temporary.\n\n1:16:14.500 --> 1:16:16.780\n Just like, you know how all the celebrities got together\n\n1:16:16.780 --> 1:16:19.100\n and sang the song Imagine by Jeff Leonard\n\n1:16:19.100 --> 1:16:20.940\n and everyone started hating the song Imagine.\n\n1:16:20.940 --> 1:16:22.060\n I'm hoping that's temporary\n\n1:16:22.060 --> 1:16:24.380\n because it's a damn good song.\n\n1:16:24.380 --> 1:16:25.500\n So I think it's just temporary.\n\n1:16:25.500 --> 1:16:27.820\n Like once you actually have virtual worlds,\n\n1:16:27.820 --> 1:16:29.940\n whatever they're called metaverse or otherwise,\n\n1:16:29.940 --> 1:16:31.420\n it becomes, I don't know.\n\n1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:32.500\n Well, we do have virtual worlds.\n\n1:16:32.500 --> 1:16:34.460\n Like video games, Elden Ring.\n\n1:16:34.460 --> 1:16:35.300\n Have you played Elden Ring?\n\n1:16:35.300 --> 1:16:36.140\n You haven't played Elden Ring?\n\n1:16:36.140 --> 1:16:38.580\n I'm really afraid of playing that game.\n\n1:16:38.580 --> 1:16:39.420\n Literally amazed.\n\n1:16:39.420 --> 1:16:40.780\n It looks way too fun.\n\n1:16:40.780 --> 1:16:45.020\n It looks I would wanna go there and stay there forever.\n\n1:16:45.020 --> 1:16:47.020\n It's yeah, so fun.\n\n1:16:47.020 --> 1:16:48.980\n It's so nice.\n\n1:16:50.500 --> 1:16:52.180\n Oh man, yeah.\n\n1:16:52.180 --> 1:16:54.500\n So that's the, yeah, that's a metaverse.\n\n1:16:54.500 --> 1:16:57.460\n That's a metaverse, but you're not really,\n\n1:16:57.460 --> 1:17:00.620\n how immersive is it in the sense that,\n\n1:17:02.820 --> 1:17:03.940\n does the three dimension\n\n1:17:03.940 --> 1:17:06.060\n like virtual reality integration necessary?\n\n1:17:06.060 --> 1:17:08.780\n Can we really just take our, close our eyes\n\n1:17:08.780 --> 1:17:12.180\n and kind of plug in in the 2D screen\n\n1:17:13.060 --> 1:17:15.780\n and become that other being for time\n\n1:17:15.780 --> 1:17:17.940\n and really enjoy that journey that we take?\n\n1:17:17.940 --> 1:17:19.660\n And we almost become that.\n\n1:17:19.660 --> 1:17:22.100\n You're no longer C, I'm no longer Lex,\n\n1:17:22.100 --> 1:17:25.340\n you're that creature, whatever the hell it is in that game.\n\n1:17:25.340 --> 1:17:26.180\n Yeah, that is that.\n\n1:17:26.180 --> 1:17:28.300\n I mean, that's why I love those video games.\n\n1:17:29.220 --> 1:17:33.100\n I really do become those people for a time.\n\n1:17:33.100 --> 1:17:36.180\n But like, it seems like with the idea of the metaverse,\n\n1:17:36.180 --> 1:17:37.900\n the idea of the digital space,\n\n1:17:37.900 --> 1:17:39.500\n well, even on Twitter,\n\n1:17:39.500 --> 1:17:42.580\n you get a chance to be somebody for prolonged periods of time\n\n1:17:42.580 --> 1:17:44.540\n like across a lifespan.\n\n1:17:44.540 --> 1:17:47.620\n You know, you have a Twitter account for years, for decades\n\n1:17:47.620 --> 1:17:48.460\n and you're that person.\n\n1:17:48.460 --> 1:17:49.660\n I don't know if that's a good thing.\n\n1:17:49.660 --> 1:17:52.660\n I feel very tormented by it.\n\n1:17:52.660 --> 1:17:54.300\n By Twitter specifically.\n\n1:17:54.300 --> 1:17:57.580\n By social media representation of you.\n\n1:17:57.580 --> 1:17:59.100\n I feel like the public perception of me\n\n1:17:59.100 --> 1:18:04.100\n has gotten so distorted that I find it kind of disturbing.\n\n1:18:04.420 --> 1:18:06.300\n It's one of the things that's disincentivizing me\n\n1:18:06.300 --> 1:18:07.900\n from like wanting to keep making art\n\n1:18:07.900 --> 1:18:09.020\n because I'm just like,\n\n1:18:11.060 --> 1:18:13.740\n I've completely lost control of the narrative.\n\n1:18:13.740 --> 1:18:16.820\n And the narrative is, some of it is my own stupidity,\n\n1:18:16.820 --> 1:18:19.260\n but a lot, like some of it has just been like hijacked\n\n1:18:19.260 --> 1:18:23.100\n by forces far beyond my control.\n\n1:18:23.100 --> 1:18:25.580\n I kind of got in over my head in things.\n\n1:18:25.580 --> 1:18:27.300\n Like I'm just a random Indian musician,\n\n1:18:27.300 --> 1:18:31.900\n but I just got like dragged into geopolitical matters\n\n1:18:31.900 --> 1:18:35.100\n and like financial, like the stock market and shit.\n\n1:18:35.100 --> 1:18:36.300\n And so it's just like, it's just,\n\n1:18:36.300 --> 1:18:37.700\n there are very powerful people\n\n1:18:37.700 --> 1:18:39.660\n who have at various points in time\n\n1:18:39.660 --> 1:18:43.700\n had very vested interest in making me seem insane\n\n1:18:43.700 --> 1:18:45.620\n and I can't fucking fight that.\n\n1:18:45.620 --> 1:18:46.940\n And I just like,\n\n1:18:48.820 --> 1:18:50.780\n people really want their celebrity figures\n\n1:18:50.780 --> 1:18:53.860\n to like be consistent and stay the same.\n\n1:18:53.860 --> 1:18:55.820\n And like people have a lot of like emotional investment\n\n1:18:55.820 --> 1:18:56.660\n in certain things.\n\n1:18:56.660 --> 1:18:59.700\n And like, first of all,\n\n1:18:59.700 --> 1:19:03.700\n like I'm like artificially more famous than I should be.\n\n1:19:03.700 --> 1:19:06.620\n Isn't everybody who's famous artificially famous?\n\n1:19:06.620 --> 1:19:11.340\n No, but like I should be like a weird niche indie thing.\n\n1:19:11.340 --> 1:19:13.380\n And I make pretty challenging,\n\n1:19:13.380 --> 1:19:16.300\n I do challenging weird fucking shit a lot.\n\n1:19:16.300 --> 1:19:21.300\n And I accidentally by proxy got like foisted\n\n1:19:22.420 --> 1:19:24.420\n into sort of like weird celebrity culture,\n\n1:19:24.420 --> 1:19:27.300\n but like I cannot be media trained.\n\n1:19:27.300 --> 1:19:29.820\n They have put me through so many hours of media training.\n\n1:19:29.820 --> 1:19:32.540\n I would love to see BF fly in that wall.\n\n1:19:32.540 --> 1:19:34.420\n I can't do, like when I do,\n\n1:19:34.420 --> 1:19:37.420\n I try so hard and I like learn this thing and I like got it.\n\n1:19:37.420 --> 1:19:38.740\n And I'm like, I got it, I got it, I got it.\n\n1:19:38.740 --> 1:19:40.540\n But I just can't stop saying,\n\n1:19:40.540 --> 1:19:42.940\n like my mouth just says things like,\n\n1:19:42.940 --> 1:19:45.340\n and it's just like, and I just do, I just do things.\n\n1:19:45.340 --> 1:19:46.580\n I just do crazy things.\n\n1:19:46.580 --> 1:19:50.740\n Like I'm, I just, I need to do crazy things.\n\n1:19:50.740 --> 1:19:53.100\n And it's just, I should not be,\n\n1:19:53.100 --> 1:19:56.580\n it's too jarring for people\n\n1:19:56.580 --> 1:19:59.700\n and the contradictory stuff.\n\n1:19:59.700 --> 1:20:04.700\n And then all the by association, like, you know,\n\n1:20:05.220 --> 1:20:09.020\n it's like I'm in a very weird position and my public image,\n\n1:20:09.900 --> 1:20:14.900\n the avatar of me is now this totally crazy thing\n\n1:20:14.900 --> 1:20:16.580\n that is so lost from my control.\n\n1:20:16.580 --> 1:20:19.140\n So you feel the burden of the avatar having to be static.\n\n1:20:19.140 --> 1:20:22.260\n So the avatar on Twitter or the avatar on Instagram\n\n1:20:22.260 --> 1:20:26.740\n on these social platforms is as a burden.\n\n1:20:26.740 --> 1:20:30.340\n It becomes like, cause like people don't want to accept\n\n1:20:30.340 --> 1:20:32.580\n a changing avatar, a chaotic avatar.\n\n1:20:32.580 --> 1:20:34.820\n Avatar is a stupid shit sometimes.\n\n1:20:34.820 --> 1:20:36.460\n They think the avatar is morally wrong\n\n1:20:36.460 --> 1:20:39.540\n or they think the avatar, and maybe it has been,\n\n1:20:39.540 --> 1:20:41.100\n and like I question it all the time.\n\n1:20:41.100 --> 1:20:46.100\n Like, I'm like, like, I don't know if everyone's right\n\n1:20:46.300 --> 1:20:47.140\n and I'm wrong.\n\n1:20:47.140 --> 1:20:50.100\n I don't know, like, but you know, a lot of times\n\n1:20:50.100 --> 1:20:51.740\n people ascribe intentions to things,\n\n1:20:51.740 --> 1:20:53.660\n the worst possible intentions.\n\n1:20:53.660 --> 1:20:55.820\n At this point, people think I'm, you know,\n\n1:20:57.300 --> 1:20:58.140\n but which is fine.\n\n1:20:58.140 --> 1:20:58.980\n All kinds of words, yes.\n\n1:20:58.980 --> 1:21:00.460\n Yes, and it's fine.\n\n1:21:00.460 --> 1:21:02.820\n I'm not complaining about it, but I'm just,\n\n1:21:02.820 --> 1:21:07.820\n it's a curiosity to me that we live these double, triple,\n\n1:21:07.900 --> 1:21:10.340\n quadruple lives and I have this other life\n\n1:21:10.340 --> 1:21:13.900\n that is like more people know my other life\n\n1:21:13.900 --> 1:21:16.340\n than my real life, which is interesting.\n\n1:21:16.340 --> 1:21:18.220\n Probably, I mean, you too, I guess, probably.\n\n1:21:18.220 --> 1:21:20.100\n Yeah, but I have the luxury.\n\n1:21:20.100 --> 1:21:23.100\n So we have all different, you know,\n\n1:21:23.100 --> 1:21:25.140\n like I don't know what I'm doing.\n\n1:21:25.140 --> 1:21:27.820\n There is an avatar and you're mediating\n\n1:21:27.820 --> 1:21:29.940\n who you are through that avatar.\n\n1:21:29.940 --> 1:21:34.340\n I have the nice luxury, not the luxury,\n\n1:21:34.340 --> 1:21:38.060\n maybe by intention of not trying really hard\n\n1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:41.460\n to make sure there's no difference between the avatar\n\n1:21:41.460 --> 1:21:42.820\n and the private person.\n\n1:21:44.020 --> 1:21:45.620\n Do you wear a suit all the time?\n\n1:21:45.620 --> 1:21:46.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:21:46.620 --> 1:21:47.740\n You do wear a suit?\n\n1:21:47.740 --> 1:21:48.940\n Not all the time.\n\n1:21:48.940 --> 1:21:51.540\n Recently, because I get recognized a lot,\n\n1:21:51.540 --> 1:21:53.420\n I have to not wear the suit to hide.\n\n1:21:53.420 --> 1:21:55.820\n I'm such an introvert, I'm such a social anxiety\n\n1:21:55.820 --> 1:21:57.660\n and all that kind of stuff, so I have to hide away.\n\n1:21:57.660 --> 1:22:00.580\n I love wearing a suit because it makes me feel\n\n1:22:00.580 --> 1:22:02.380\n like I'm taking the moment seriously.\n\n1:22:02.380 --> 1:22:04.340\n Like I'm, I don't know.\n\n1:22:04.340 --> 1:22:06.980\n It makes me feel like a weirdo in the best possible way.\n\n1:22:06.980 --> 1:22:08.500\n Suits feel great, every time I wear a suit,\n\n1:22:08.500 --> 1:22:10.780\n I'm like, I don't know why I'm not doing this more.\n\n1:22:10.780 --> 1:22:15.300\n Fashion in general, if you're doing it for yourself,\n\n1:22:15.300 --> 1:22:18.660\n I don't know, it's a really awesome thing.\n\n1:22:18.660 --> 1:22:23.660\n But yeah, I think there is definitely a painful way\n\n1:22:24.620 --> 1:22:27.380\n to use social media and an empowering way.\n\n1:22:27.380 --> 1:22:32.380\n And I don't know if any of us know which is which.\n\n1:22:32.620 --> 1:22:33.940\n So we're trying to figure that out.\n\n1:22:33.940 --> 1:22:36.780\n Some people, I think Doja Cat is incredible at it.\n\n1:22:36.780 --> 1:22:39.540\n Incredible, like just masterful.\n\n1:22:39.540 --> 1:22:41.860\n I don't know if you like follow that.\n\n1:22:41.860 --> 1:22:44.780\n So okay, so not taking anything seriously,\n\n1:22:44.780 --> 1:22:47.420\n joking, absurd, humor, that kind of thing.\n\n1:22:47.420 --> 1:22:48.540\n I think Doja Cat might be like\n\n1:22:48.540 --> 1:22:52.080\n the greatest living comedian right now.\n\n1:22:52.080 --> 1:22:53.580\n Like I'm more entertained by Doja Cat\n\n1:22:53.580 --> 1:22:56.220\n than actual comedians.\n\n1:22:56.220 --> 1:22:58.900\n Like she's really fucking funny on the internet.\n\n1:22:58.900 --> 1:23:00.220\n She's just great at social media.\n\n1:23:00.220 --> 1:23:02.220\n It's just, you know.\n\n1:23:02.220 --> 1:23:05.500\n Yeah, the nature of humor, like humor on social media\n\n1:23:05.500 --> 1:23:08.940\n is also a beautiful thing, the absurdity.\n\n1:23:08.940 --> 1:23:09.780\n The absurdity.\n\n1:23:09.780 --> 1:23:12.700\n And memes, like I just wanna like take a moment.\n\n1:23:12.700 --> 1:23:14.580\n I love, like when we're talking about art\n\n1:23:14.580 --> 1:23:18.180\n and credit and authenticity, I love that there's this,\n\n1:23:18.180 --> 1:23:21.840\n I mean now memes are like, they're no longer,\n\n1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:23.640\n like memes aren't like new,\n\n1:23:23.640 --> 1:23:25.580\n but it's still this emergent art form\n\n1:23:25.580 --> 1:23:27.720\n that is completely egoless and anonymous\n\n1:23:27.720 --> 1:23:29.480\n and we just don't know who made any of it.\n\n1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:32.560\n And it's like the forefront of comedy\n\n1:23:32.560 --> 1:23:35.420\n and it's just totally anonymous\n\n1:23:35.420 --> 1:23:36.620\n and it just feels really beautiful.\n\n1:23:36.620 --> 1:23:38.380\n It just feels like this beautiful\n\n1:23:38.380 --> 1:23:43.260\n collective human art project\n\n1:23:43.260 --> 1:23:46.420\n that's like this like decentralized comedy thing\n\n1:23:46.420 --> 1:23:48.860\n that just makes memes add so much to my day\n\n1:23:48.860 --> 1:23:49.860\n and many people's days.\n\n1:23:49.860 --> 1:23:52.120\n And it's just like, I don't know.\n\n1:23:52.120 --> 1:23:54.860\n I don't think people ever,\n\n1:23:54.860 --> 1:23:56.020\n I don't think we stop enough\n\n1:23:56.020 --> 1:23:59.860\n and just appreciate how sick it is that memes exist.\n\n1:23:59.860 --> 1:24:02.420\n Because also making a whole brand new art form\n\n1:24:02.420 --> 1:24:07.060\n in like the modern era that's like didn't exist before.\n\n1:24:07.060 --> 1:24:08.520\n Like, I mean they sort of existed,\n\n1:24:08.520 --> 1:24:11.860\n but the way that they exist now as like this like,\n\n1:24:11.860 --> 1:24:13.240\n you know, like me and my friends,\n\n1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:16.320\n like we joke that we go like mining for memes\n\n1:24:16.320 --> 1:24:18.620\n or farming for memes, like a video game\n\n1:24:18.620 --> 1:24:21.100\n and like meme dealers and like whatever.\n\n1:24:21.100 --> 1:24:22.740\n Like it's, you know, it's this whole,\n\n1:24:22.740 --> 1:24:27.740\n memes are this whole like new comedic language.\n\n1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:29.260\n Well, it's this art form.\n\n1:24:29.260 --> 1:24:31.260\n The interesting thing about it is that\n\n1:24:31.260 --> 1:24:35.380\n lame people seem to not be good at memes.\n\n1:24:35.380 --> 1:24:38.180\n Like corporate can't infiltrate memes.\n\n1:24:38.180 --> 1:24:39.860\n Yeah, they really can't.\n\n1:24:39.860 --> 1:24:41.460\n They try, they could try.\n\n1:24:41.460 --> 1:24:43.340\n But it's like, it's weird cause like.\n\n1:24:43.340 --> 1:24:45.560\n They try so hard and every once in a while,\n\n1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:48.660\n I'm like fine, like you got a good one.\n\n1:24:48.660 --> 1:24:51.420\n I think I've seen like one or two good ones,\n\n1:24:51.420 --> 1:24:53.340\n but like, yeah, they really can't.\n\n1:24:53.340 --> 1:24:55.500\n Cause they're even, corporate is infiltrating web three.\n\n1:24:55.500 --> 1:24:57.140\n It's making me really sad,\n\n1:24:57.140 --> 1:24:58.660\n but they can't infiltrate the memes.\n\n1:24:58.660 --> 1:25:00.100\n And I think there's something really beautiful about that.\n\n1:25:00.100 --> 1:25:03.580\n That gives power, that's why Dogecoin is powerful.\n\n1:25:03.580 --> 1:25:05.880\n It's like, all right, I'm gonna F you\n\n1:25:05.880 --> 1:25:08.820\n to sort of anybody who's trying to centralize,\n\n1:25:08.820 --> 1:25:10.420\n is trying to control the rich people\n\n1:25:10.420 --> 1:25:12.720\n that are trying to roll in and control this,\n\n1:25:12.720 --> 1:25:14.220\n control the narrative.\n\n1:25:14.220 --> 1:25:16.220\n Wow, I hadn't thought about that, but.\n\n1:25:17.220 --> 1:25:18.520\n How would you fix Twitter?\n\n1:25:18.520 --> 1:25:20.840\n How would you fix social media for your own?\n\n1:25:21.680 --> 1:25:25.220\n Like you're an optimist, you're a positive person.\n\n1:25:25.220 --> 1:25:27.500\n There's a bit of a cynicism that you have currently\n\n1:25:27.500 --> 1:25:30.700\n about this particular little slice of humanity.\n\n1:25:30.700 --> 1:25:32.700\n I tend to think Twitter could be beautiful.\n\n1:25:32.700 --> 1:25:34.060\n I'm not that cynical about it.\n\n1:25:34.060 --> 1:25:35.140\n I'm not that cynical about it.\n\n1:25:35.140 --> 1:25:37.700\n I actually refuse to be a cynic on principle.\n\n1:25:37.700 --> 1:25:38.540\n Yes.\n\n1:25:38.540 --> 1:25:41.140\n I was just briefly expressing some personal pathos.\n\n1:25:41.140 --> 1:25:42.140\n Personal stuff.\n\n1:25:42.140 --> 1:25:45.900\n It was just some personal pathos, but like, like.\n\n1:25:45.900 --> 1:25:48.060\n Just to vent a little bit, just to speak.\n\n1:25:48.060 --> 1:25:50.860\n I don't have cancer, I love my family.\n\n1:25:50.860 --> 1:25:51.980\n I have a good life.\n\n1:25:51.980 --> 1:25:55.380\n That is, if that is my biggest,\n\n1:25:55.380 --> 1:25:56.220\n one of my biggest problems.\n\n1:25:56.220 --> 1:25:57.180\n Then it's a good life.\n\n1:25:57.180 --> 1:25:59.860\n Yeah, you know, that was a brief,\n\n1:25:59.860 --> 1:26:01.380\n although I do think there are a lot of issues with Twitter\n\n1:26:01.380 --> 1:26:03.180\n just in terms of like the public mental health,\n\n1:26:03.180 --> 1:26:07.700\n but due to my proximity to the current dramas,\n\n1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:13.820\n I honestly feel that I should not have opinions about this\n\n1:26:13.820 --> 1:26:17.820\n because I think\n\n1:26:17.820 --> 1:26:22.820\n that if Elon ends up getting Twitter,\n\n1:26:28.380 --> 1:26:33.180\n that is a, being the arbiter of truth or public discussion,\n\n1:26:33.180 --> 1:26:34.660\n that is a responsibility.\n\n1:26:36.260 --> 1:26:41.260\n I do not, I am not qualified to be responsible for that.\n\n1:26:41.260 --> 1:26:45.260\n And I do not want to say something\n\n1:26:45.260 --> 1:26:48.340\n that might like dismantle democracy.\n\n1:26:48.340 --> 1:26:49.780\n And so I just like, actually,\n\n1:26:49.780 --> 1:26:52.140\n I actually think I should not have opinions about this\n\n1:26:52.140 --> 1:26:54.260\n because I truly am not,\n\n1:26:55.100 --> 1:26:56.740\n I don't want to have the wrong opinion about this.\n\n1:26:56.740 --> 1:27:00.180\n And I think I'm too close to the actual situation\n\n1:27:00.180 --> 1:27:04.300\n wherein I should not have, I have thoughts in my brain,\n\n1:27:04.300 --> 1:27:09.300\n but I think I am scared by my proximity to this situation.\n\n1:27:09.620 --> 1:27:14.620\n Isn't that crazy that a few words that you could say\n\n1:27:14.620 --> 1:27:18.780\n could change world affairs and hurt people?\n\n1:27:18.780 --> 1:27:21.780\n I mean, that's the nature of celebrity at a certain point\n\n1:27:22.980 --> 1:27:27.140\n that you have to be, you have to a little bit, a little bit,\n\n1:27:27.140 --> 1:27:30.540\n not so much that it destroys you or puts too much constraints,\n\n1:27:30.540 --> 1:27:32.620\n but you have to a little bit think about\n\n1:27:32.620 --> 1:27:33.940\n the impact of your words.\n\n1:27:33.940 --> 1:27:36.660\n I mean, we as humans, you talk to somebody at a bar,\n\n1:27:36.660 --> 1:27:39.100\n you have to think about the impact of your words.\n\n1:27:39.100 --> 1:27:40.340\n Like you can say positive things,\n\n1:27:40.340 --> 1:27:41.500\n you can say negative things,\n\n1:27:41.500 --> 1:27:43.340\n you can affect the direction of one life.\n\n1:27:43.340 --> 1:27:45.260\n But on social media, your words can affect\n\n1:27:45.260 --> 1:27:48.060\n the direction of many lives.\n\n1:27:48.060 --> 1:27:48.900\n That's crazy.\n\n1:27:48.900 --> 1:27:50.420\n It's a crazy world to live in.\n\n1:27:50.420 --> 1:27:52.980\n It's worthwhile to consider that responsibility,\n\n1:27:52.980 --> 1:27:54.100\n take it seriously.\n\n1:27:54.100 --> 1:27:59.100\n Sometimes just like you did choose kind of silence,\n\n1:28:00.740 --> 1:28:03.580\n choose sort of respectful.\n\n1:28:03.580 --> 1:28:05.260\n Like I do have a lot of thoughts on the matter.\n\n1:28:05.260 --> 1:28:10.100\n I'm just, I don't, if my thoughts are wrong,\n\n1:28:10.100 --> 1:28:12.820\n this is one situation where the stakes are high.\n\n1:28:12.820 --> 1:28:15.740\n You mentioned a while back that you were in a cult\n\n1:28:15.740 --> 1:28:17.260\n that's centered around bureaucracy,\n\n1:28:17.260 --> 1:28:18.460\n so you can't really do anything\n\n1:28:18.460 --> 1:28:20.460\n because it involves a lot of paperwork.\n\n1:28:20.460 --> 1:28:24.700\n And I really love a cult that's just like Kafkaesque.\n\n1:28:24.700 --> 1:28:25.740\n Yes.\n\n1:28:25.740 --> 1:28:26.580\n Just like.\n\n1:28:26.580 --> 1:28:27.660\n I mean, it was like a joke, but it was.\n\n1:28:27.660 --> 1:28:29.300\n I know, but I love this idea.\n\n1:28:29.300 --> 1:28:30.420\n The Holy Rain Empire.\n\n1:28:30.420 --> 1:28:34.860\n Yeah, it was just like a Kafkaesque pro bureaucracy cult.\n\n1:28:34.860 --> 1:28:36.820\n But I feel like that's what human civilization is,\n\n1:28:36.820 --> 1:28:38.500\n is that, because when you said that, I was like,\n\n1:28:38.500 --> 1:28:40.620\n oh, that is kind of what humanity is,\n\n1:28:40.620 --> 1:28:41.660\n is this bureaucracy cult.\n\n1:28:41.660 --> 1:28:45.620\n I do, yeah, I have this theory.\n\n1:28:45.620 --> 1:28:49.700\n I really think that we really,\n\n1:28:50.700 --> 1:28:53.580\n bureaucracy is starting to kill us.\n\n1:28:53.580 --> 1:28:58.580\n And I think like we need to reorient laws and stuff.\n\n1:28:59.540 --> 1:29:01.940\n Like, I think we just need sunset clauses on everything.\n\n1:29:01.940 --> 1:29:04.580\n Like, I think the rate of change in culture\n\n1:29:04.580 --> 1:29:06.660\n is happening so fast and the rate of change in technology\n\n1:29:06.660 --> 1:29:07.900\n and everything is happening so fast.\n\n1:29:07.900 --> 1:29:10.780\n It's like, when you see these hearings\n\n1:29:10.780 --> 1:29:15.780\n about like social media and Cambridge Analytica\n\n1:29:15.820 --> 1:29:19.180\n and everyone talking, it's like, even from that point,\n\n1:29:19.180 --> 1:29:21.380\n so much technological change has happened\n\n1:29:21.380 --> 1:29:22.740\n from like those hearings.\n\n1:29:22.740 --> 1:29:24.860\n And it's just like, we're trying to make all these laws now\n\n1:29:24.860 --> 1:29:25.940\n about AI and stuff.\n\n1:29:25.940 --> 1:29:27.380\n I feel like we should be updating things\n\n1:29:27.380 --> 1:29:28.380\n like every five years.\n\n1:29:28.380 --> 1:29:30.140\n And like one of the big issues in our society right now\n\n1:29:30.140 --> 1:29:32.260\n is we're just getting bogged down by laws\n\n1:29:32.260 --> 1:29:37.020\n and it's making it very hard to change things\n\n1:29:37.020 --> 1:29:37.860\n and develop things.\n\n1:29:37.860 --> 1:29:41.500\n In Austin, I don't wanna speak on this too much,\n\n1:29:41.500 --> 1:29:43.220\n but like one of my friends is working on a housing bill\n\n1:29:43.220 --> 1:29:45.020\n in Austin to try to like prevent\n\n1:29:45.020 --> 1:29:47.180\n like a San Francisco situation from happening here\n\n1:29:47.180 --> 1:29:49.940\n because obviously we're getting a little mini San Francisco\n\n1:29:49.940 --> 1:29:52.140\n here, like housing prices are skyrocketing,\n\n1:29:52.140 --> 1:29:54.740\n it's causing massive gentrification.\n\n1:29:54.740 --> 1:29:59.180\n This is really bad for anyone who's not super rich.\n\n1:29:59.180 --> 1:30:00.860\n Like, there's so much bureaucracy.\n\n1:30:00.860 --> 1:30:01.900\n Part of the reason this is happening\n\n1:30:01.900 --> 1:30:04.020\n is because you need all these permits to build.\n\n1:30:04.020 --> 1:30:06.460\n It takes like years to get permits to like build anything.\n\n1:30:06.460 --> 1:30:09.100\n It's so hard to build and so there's very limited housing\n\n1:30:09.100 --> 1:30:10.900\n and there's a massive influx of people.\n\n1:30:10.900 --> 1:30:13.460\n And it's just like, you know, this is a microcosm\n\n1:30:13.460 --> 1:30:15.540\n of like problems that are happening all over the world\n\n1:30:15.540 --> 1:30:18.780\n where it's just like, we're dealing with laws\n\n1:30:18.780 --> 1:30:22.340\n that are like 10, 20, 30, 40, 100, 200 years old\n\n1:30:22.340 --> 1:30:24.100\n and they are no longer relevant\n\n1:30:24.100 --> 1:30:25.660\n and it's just slowing everything down\n\n1:30:25.660 --> 1:30:27.980\n and causing massive social pain.\n\n1:30:29.100 --> 1:30:32.820\n Yeah, but it's like, it's also makes me sad\n\n1:30:32.820 --> 1:30:35.740\n when I see politicians talk about technology\n\n1:30:35.740 --> 1:30:38.420\n and when they don't really get it.\n\n1:30:38.420 --> 1:30:41.140\n But most importantly, they lack curiosity\n\n1:30:41.140 --> 1:30:44.780\n and like that like inspired excitement\n\n1:30:44.780 --> 1:30:46.580\n about like how stuff works and all that stuff.\n\n1:30:46.580 --> 1:30:47.780\n They're just like, they see,\n\n1:30:47.780 --> 1:30:50.140\n they have a very cynical view of technology.\n\n1:30:50.140 --> 1:30:52.180\n It's like tech companies are just trying to do evil\n\n1:30:52.180 --> 1:30:53.540\n on the world from their perspective\n\n1:30:53.540 --> 1:30:55.860\n and they have no curiosity about like\n\n1:30:55.860 --> 1:30:59.820\n how recommender systems work or how AI systems work,\n\n1:30:59.820 --> 1:31:02.700\n natural language processing, how robotics works,\n\n1:31:02.700 --> 1:31:05.860\n how computer vision works, you know.\n\n1:31:05.860 --> 1:31:08.660\n They always take the most cynical possible interpretation\n\n1:31:08.660 --> 1:31:09.860\n of what technology would be used\n\n1:31:09.860 --> 1:31:11.660\n and we should definitely be concerned about that\n\n1:31:11.660 --> 1:31:13.780\n but if you're constantly worried about that\n\n1:31:13.780 --> 1:31:15.020\n and you're regulating based on that,\n\n1:31:15.020 --> 1:31:16.980\n you're just going to slow down all the innovation.\n\n1:31:16.980 --> 1:31:19.420\n I do think a huge priority right now\n\n1:31:19.420 --> 1:31:24.420\n is undoing the bad energy\n\n1:31:25.740 --> 1:31:28.060\n surrounding the emergence of Silicon Valley.\n\n1:31:28.060 --> 1:31:30.020\n Like I think that like a lot of things\n\n1:31:30.020 --> 1:31:31.820\n were very irresponsible during that time\n\n1:31:31.820 --> 1:31:36.140\n and you know, like even just this current whole thing\n\n1:31:36.140 --> 1:31:36.980\n with Twitter and everything,\n\n1:31:36.980 --> 1:31:39.980\n it's like there has been a lot of negative outcomes\n\n1:31:39.980 --> 1:31:44.260\n from the sort of technocracy boom\n\n1:31:44.260 --> 1:31:46.060\n but one of the things that's happening\n\n1:31:46.060 --> 1:31:49.100\n is that like it's alienating people\n\n1:31:49.100 --> 1:31:52.340\n from wanting to care about technology\n\n1:31:52.340 --> 1:31:56.020\n and I actually think technology is probably\n\n1:31:56.020 --> 1:31:58.900\n some of the better, probably the best.\n\n1:31:58.900 --> 1:32:01.620\n I think we can fix a lot of our problems\n\n1:32:01.620 --> 1:32:03.220\n more easily with technology\n\n1:32:03.220 --> 1:32:07.100\n than with you know, fighting the powers that be\n\n1:32:07.100 --> 1:32:09.700\n as a you know, not to go back to the Star Wars quote\n\n1:32:09.700 --> 1:32:11.300\n or the Buckminster Fuller quote.\n\n1:32:11.300 --> 1:32:12.940\n Let's go to some dark questions.\n\n1:32:14.700 --> 1:32:17.860\n If we may for time, what is the darkest place\n\n1:32:17.860 --> 1:32:20.220\n you've ever gone in your mind?\n\n1:32:20.220 --> 1:32:23.860\n Is there a time, a period of time, a moment\n\n1:32:23.860 --> 1:32:28.860\n that you remember that was difficult for you?\n\n1:32:29.580 --> 1:32:30.460\n I mean, when I was 18,\n\n1:32:30.460 --> 1:32:32.460\n my best friend died of a heroin overdose\n\n1:32:33.460 --> 1:32:35.980\n and it was like my,\n\n1:32:38.300 --> 1:32:39.780\n and then shortly after that,\n\n1:32:39.780 --> 1:32:41.980\n one of my other best friends committed suicide\n\n1:32:44.700 --> 1:32:48.620\n and that sort of like coming into adulthood,\n\n1:32:48.620 --> 1:32:51.140\n dealing with two of the most important people in my life\n\n1:32:51.140 --> 1:32:53.140\n dying in extremely disturbing violent ways\n\n1:32:53.140 --> 1:32:55.860\n was a lot.\n\n1:32:55.860 --> 1:32:56.700\n That was a lot.\n\n1:32:56.700 --> 1:32:57.540\n Do you miss them?\n\n1:32:58.340 --> 1:32:59.860\n Yeah, definitely miss them.\n\n1:32:59.860 --> 1:33:02.660\n Did that make you think about your own life?\n\n1:33:02.660 --> 1:33:04.860\n About the finiteness of your own life?\n\n1:33:04.860 --> 1:33:08.100\n The places your mind can go?\n\n1:33:08.100 --> 1:33:10.860\n Did you ever in the distance, far away\n\n1:33:10.860 --> 1:33:15.380\n contemplate just your own death?\n\n1:33:15.380 --> 1:33:17.220\n Or maybe even taking your own life?\n\n1:33:17.220 --> 1:33:18.660\n Oh never, oh no.\n\n1:33:18.660 --> 1:33:20.380\n I'm so, I love my life.\n\n1:33:20.380 --> 1:33:23.060\n I cannot fathom suicide.\n\n1:33:23.060 --> 1:33:24.100\n I'm so scared of death.\n\n1:33:24.100 --> 1:33:25.980\n I haven't, I'm too scared of death.\n\n1:33:25.980 --> 1:33:28.740\n My manager, my manager's like the most Zen guy.\n\n1:33:28.740 --> 1:33:31.060\n My manager's always like, you need to accept death.\n\n1:33:31.060 --> 1:33:32.060\n You need to accept death.\n\n1:33:32.060 --> 1:33:34.180\n And I'm like, look, I can do your meditation.\n\n1:33:34.180 --> 1:33:37.300\n I can do the meditation, but I cannot accept death.\n\n1:33:37.300 --> 1:33:40.340\n I like, I will fight, I'm terrified of death.\n\n1:33:40.340 --> 1:33:42.740\n I will like fight.\n\n1:33:42.740 --> 1:33:45.060\n Although I actually think death is important.\n\n1:33:45.060 --> 1:33:49.060\n I recently went to this meeting about immortality\n\n1:33:50.020 --> 1:33:51.500\n and in the process of.\n\n1:33:51.500 --> 1:33:53.300\n That's the actual topic of the meeting?\n\n1:33:53.300 --> 1:33:54.140\n I'm sorry.\n\n1:33:54.140 --> 1:33:54.980\n No, no, it was this girl.\n\n1:33:54.980 --> 1:33:58.940\n It was a bunch of people working on like anti aging stuff.\n\n1:33:58.940 --> 1:34:01.980\n It was like some like seminary thing about it.\n\n1:34:01.980 --> 1:34:03.300\n And I went in really excited.\n\n1:34:03.300 --> 1:34:05.180\n I was like, yeah, like, okay, like, what do you got?\n\n1:34:05.180 --> 1:34:07.860\n Like, how can I live for 500 years or a thousand years?\n\n1:34:07.860 --> 1:34:10.620\n And then like over the course of the meeting,\n\n1:34:10.620 --> 1:34:11.940\n like it was sort of like, right.\n\n1:34:11.940 --> 1:34:13.140\n It was like two or three days\n\n1:34:13.140 --> 1:34:14.580\n after the Russian invasion started.\n\n1:34:14.580 --> 1:34:17.300\n And I was like, man, like, what if Putin was immortal?\n\n1:34:17.300 --> 1:34:20.900\n Like, what if I'm like, man, maybe immortality,\n\n1:34:20.900 --> 1:34:23.620\n is not good.\n\n1:34:23.620 --> 1:34:25.740\n I mean, like if you get into the later Dune stuff,\n\n1:34:25.740 --> 1:34:29.020\n the immortals cause a lot of problem.\n\n1:34:29.020 --> 1:34:30.980\n Cause as we were talking about earlier with the music\n\n1:34:30.980 --> 1:34:34.740\n and like brains calcify, like good people\n\n1:34:34.740 --> 1:34:36.900\n could become immortal, but bad people could become immortal.\n\n1:34:36.900 --> 1:34:41.900\n But I also think even the best people power corrupts\n\n1:34:43.340 --> 1:34:46.740\n and power alienates you from like the common human experience\n\n1:34:46.740 --> 1:34:47.580\n and.\n\n1:34:47.580 --> 1:34:49.100\n Right, so the people that get more and more powerful.\n\n1:34:49.100 --> 1:34:52.220\n Even the best people who like, whose brains are amazing,\n\n1:34:52.220 --> 1:34:54.780\n like I think death might be important.\n\n1:34:54.780 --> 1:34:57.380\n I think death is part of, you know,\n\n1:34:57.380 --> 1:35:01.020\n like I think with AI one thing we might want to consider,\n\n1:35:01.020 --> 1:35:02.420\n I don't know, when I talk about AI,\n\n1:35:02.420 --> 1:35:04.540\n I'm such not an expert and probably everyone has\n\n1:35:04.540 --> 1:35:06.220\n all these ideas and they're already figured out.\n\n1:35:06.220 --> 1:35:07.060\n But when I was talking.\n\n1:35:07.060 --> 1:35:08.540\n Nobody is an expert in anything.\n\n1:35:08.540 --> 1:35:09.900\n See, okay, go ahead.\n\n1:35:09.900 --> 1:35:10.740\n But when I.\n\n1:35:10.740 --> 1:35:11.580\n You were talking about.\n\n1:35:11.580 --> 1:35:13.180\n Yeah, but I like, it's just like,\n\n1:35:13.180 --> 1:35:16.100\n I think some kind of pruning.\n\n1:35:16.100 --> 1:35:20.140\n But it's a tricky thing because if there's too much\n\n1:35:20.140 --> 1:35:25.140\n of a focus on youth culture, then you don't have the wisdom.\n\n1:35:25.460 --> 1:35:27.740\n So I feel like we're in a tricky,\n\n1:35:27.740 --> 1:35:30.300\n we're in a tricky moment right now in society\n\n1:35:30.300 --> 1:35:32.460\n where it's like, we've really perfected living\n\n1:35:32.460 --> 1:35:33.300\n for a long time.\n\n1:35:33.300 --> 1:35:35.780\n So there's all these really like old people\n\n1:35:35.780 --> 1:35:39.540\n who are like really voting against the wellbeing\n\n1:35:39.540 --> 1:35:41.540\n of the young people, you know?\n\n1:35:41.540 --> 1:35:45.180\n And like, it's like there shouldn't be all this student dead\n\n1:35:45.180 --> 1:35:48.540\n and we need like healthcare, like universal healthcare\n\n1:35:48.540 --> 1:35:52.460\n and like just voting against like best interests.\n\n1:35:52.460 --> 1:35:53.660\n But then you have all these young people\n\n1:35:53.660 --> 1:35:55.980\n that don't have the wisdom that are like,\n\n1:35:55.980 --> 1:35:57.620\n yeah, we need communism and stuff.\n\n1:35:57.620 --> 1:36:00.740\n And it's just like, like literally I got canceled\n\n1:36:00.740 --> 1:36:04.980\n at one point for, I ironically used a Stalin quote\n\n1:36:04.980 --> 1:36:08.420\n in my high school yearbook, but it was actually like a diss\n\n1:36:08.420 --> 1:36:09.620\n against my high school.\n\n1:36:09.620 --> 1:36:10.460\n I saw that.\n\n1:36:10.460 --> 1:36:13.180\n Yeah, and people were like, you used to be a Stalinist\n\n1:36:13.180 --> 1:36:15.860\n and now you're a class traitor and it's like,\n\n1:36:15.860 --> 1:36:19.260\n it's like, oh man, just like, please Google Stalin.\n\n1:36:19.260 --> 1:36:20.500\n Please Google Stalin.\n\n1:36:20.500 --> 1:36:21.340\n Like, you know.\n\n1:36:21.340 --> 1:36:23.980\n Ignoring the lessons of history, yes.\n\n1:36:23.980 --> 1:36:26.100\n And it's like, we're in this really weird middle ground\n\n1:36:26.100 --> 1:36:31.100\n where it's like, we are not finding the happy medium\n\n1:36:31.220 --> 1:36:34.700\n between wisdom and fresh ideas\n\n1:36:34.700 --> 1:36:35.900\n and they're fighting each other.\n\n1:36:35.900 --> 1:36:40.900\n And it's like, like really, like what we need is like\n\n1:36:40.900 --> 1:36:43.860\n the fresh ideas and the wisdom to be like collaborating.\n\n1:36:43.860 --> 1:36:45.140\n And it's like.\n\n1:36:45.140 --> 1:36:47.300\n What the fighting in a way is the searching\n\n1:36:47.300 --> 1:36:48.500\n for the happy medium.\n\n1:36:48.500 --> 1:36:51.020\n And in a way, maybe we are finding the happy medium.\n\n1:36:51.020 --> 1:36:52.940\n Maybe that's what the happy medium looks like.\n\n1:36:52.940 --> 1:36:54.980\n And for AI systems, there has to be,\n\n1:36:54.980 --> 1:36:57.140\n it's, you know, you have the reinforcement learning,\n\n1:36:57.140 --> 1:37:00.340\n you have the dance between exploration and exploitation,\n\n1:37:00.340 --> 1:37:03.380\n sort of doing crazy stuff to see if there's something better\n\n1:37:03.380 --> 1:37:05.420\n than what you think is the optimal\n\n1:37:05.420 --> 1:37:06.620\n and then doing the optimal thing\n\n1:37:06.620 --> 1:37:08.620\n and dancing back and forth from that.\n\n1:37:08.620 --> 1:37:10.660\n You would, Stuart Russell, I don't know if you know that,\n\n1:37:10.660 --> 1:37:15.660\n is AI guy with, thinks about sort of\n\n1:37:15.820 --> 1:37:18.580\n how to control super intelligent AI systems.\n\n1:37:18.580 --> 1:37:21.500\n And his idea is that we should inject uncertainty\n\n1:37:21.500 --> 1:37:24.980\n and sort of humility into AI systems that they never,\n\n1:37:24.980 --> 1:37:28.100\n as they get wiser and wiser and wiser and more intelligent,\n\n1:37:28.100 --> 1:37:30.020\n they're never really sure.\n\n1:37:30.020 --> 1:37:31.620\n They always doubt themselves.\n\n1:37:31.620 --> 1:37:34.340\n And in some sense, when you think of young people,\n\n1:37:34.340 --> 1:37:36.300\n that's a mechanism for doubt.\n\n1:37:36.300 --> 1:37:38.860\n It's like, it's how society doubts\n\n1:37:38.860 --> 1:37:40.860\n whether the thing it has converged towards\n\n1:37:40.860 --> 1:37:41.940\n is the right answer.\n\n1:37:41.940 --> 1:37:44.860\n So the voices of the young people\n\n1:37:44.860 --> 1:37:48.140\n is a society asking itself a question.\n\n1:37:48.140 --> 1:37:51.100\n The way I've been doing stuff for the past 50 years,\n\n1:37:51.100 --> 1:37:52.460\n maybe it's the wrong way.\n\n1:37:52.460 --> 1:37:55.340\n And so you can have all of that within one AI system.\n\n1:37:55.340 --> 1:37:57.460\n I also think, though, that we need to,\n\n1:37:57.460 --> 1:37:59.900\n I mean, actually, that's actually really interesting\n\n1:37:59.900 --> 1:38:00.740\n and really cool.\n\n1:38:01.820 --> 1:38:04.500\n But I also think there's a fine balance of,\n\n1:38:04.500 --> 1:38:09.500\n I think we maybe also overvalue the idea\n\n1:38:09.500 --> 1:38:11.180\n that the old systems are always bad.\n\n1:38:11.180 --> 1:38:14.140\n And I think there are things that we are perfecting\n\n1:38:14.140 --> 1:38:16.780\n and we might be accidentally overthrowing things\n\n1:38:16.780 --> 1:38:19.060\n that we actually have gotten to a good point.\n\n1:38:19.060 --> 1:38:22.180\n Just because we value disruption so much\n\n1:38:22.180 --> 1:38:24.780\n and we value fighting against the generations\n\n1:38:24.780 --> 1:38:29.780\n before us so much that there's also an aspect of,\n\n1:38:29.980 --> 1:38:32.100\n sometimes we're taking two steps forward, one step back\n\n1:38:32.100 --> 1:38:36.300\n because, okay, maybe we kind of did solve this thing\n\n1:38:36.300 --> 1:38:38.500\n and now we're like fucking it up, you know?\n\n1:38:38.500 --> 1:38:43.500\n And so I think there's like a middle ground there too.\n\n1:38:44.300 --> 1:38:46.700\n Yeah, we're in search of that happy medium.\n\n1:38:46.700 --> 1:38:49.780\n Let me ask you a bunch of crazy questions, okay?\n\n1:38:49.780 --> 1:38:50.900\n All right.\n\n1:38:50.900 --> 1:38:53.340\n You can answer in a short way or in a long way.\n\n1:38:53.340 --> 1:38:55.700\n What's the scariest thing you've ever done?\n\n1:38:55.700 --> 1:38:57.780\n These questions are gonna be ridiculous.\n\n1:38:57.780 --> 1:39:00.780\n Something tiny or something big.\n\n1:39:00.780 --> 1:39:05.780\n Something big, skydiving or touring your first record,\n\n1:39:09.860 --> 1:39:12.100\n going on this podcast.\n\n1:39:12.100 --> 1:39:14.740\n I've had two crazy brushes, like really scary brushes\n\n1:39:14.740 --> 1:39:16.980\n with death where I randomly got away on scay.\n\n1:39:16.980 --> 1:39:19.180\n I don't know if I should talk about those on here.\n\n1:39:19.180 --> 1:39:20.020\n Well, I don't know.\n\n1:39:20.020 --> 1:39:22.820\n I think I might be the luckiest person alive though.\n\n1:39:22.820 --> 1:39:25.980\n Like this might be too dark for a podcast though.\n\n1:39:25.980 --> 1:39:27.820\n I feel like, I don't know if this is like good content\n\n1:39:27.820 --> 1:39:28.700\n for a podcast.\n\n1:39:28.700 --> 1:39:30.220\n I don't know what is good content.\n\n1:39:30.220 --> 1:39:31.580\n It might hijack.\n\n1:39:31.580 --> 1:39:32.420\n Here's a safer one.\n\n1:39:32.420 --> 1:39:36.740\n I mean, having a baby really scared me.\n\n1:39:36.740 --> 1:39:37.580\n Before.\n\n1:39:37.580 --> 1:39:38.900\n Just the birth process.\n\n1:39:38.900 --> 1:39:43.900\n Surgery, like just having a baby is really scary.\n\n1:39:45.940 --> 1:39:47.540\n So just like the medical aspect of it,\n\n1:39:47.540 --> 1:39:49.300\n not the responsibility.\n\n1:39:49.300 --> 1:39:51.300\n Were you ready for the responsibility?\n\n1:39:51.300 --> 1:39:53.980\n Did you, were you ready to be a mother?\n\n1:39:53.980 --> 1:39:56.260\n All the beautiful things that comes with motherhood\n\n1:39:56.260 --> 1:39:57.580\n that you were talking about.\n\n1:39:57.580 --> 1:40:01.060\n All the changes and all that, were you ready for that?\n\n1:40:01.060 --> 1:40:02.980\n Or did you feel ready for that?\n\n1:40:02.980 --> 1:40:05.340\n No, I think it took about nine months\n\n1:40:05.340 --> 1:40:06.580\n to start getting ready for it.\n\n1:40:06.580 --> 1:40:08.380\n And I'm still getting more ready for it\n\n1:40:08.380 --> 1:40:12.980\n because now you keep realizing more things\n\n1:40:12.980 --> 1:40:14.220\n as they start getting.\n\n1:40:14.220 --> 1:40:16.420\n As the consciousness grows.\n\n1:40:16.420 --> 1:40:18.380\n And stuff you didn't notice with the first one,\n\n1:40:18.380 --> 1:40:19.700\n now that you've seen the first one older,\n\n1:40:19.700 --> 1:40:21.720\n you're noticing it more.\n\n1:40:21.720 --> 1:40:24.420\n Like the sort of like existential horror\n\n1:40:24.420 --> 1:40:28.340\n of coming into consciousness with Baby Y\n\n1:40:28.340 --> 1:40:30.220\n or Baby Sailor Mars or whatever.\n\n1:40:30.220 --> 1:40:31.500\n She has like so many names at this point\n\n1:40:31.500 --> 1:40:36.140\n that it's, we really need to probably settle on one.\n\n1:40:36.140 --> 1:40:38.340\n If you could be someone else for a day,\n\n1:40:38.340 --> 1:40:41.820\n someone alive today, but somebody you haven't met yet,\n\n1:40:41.820 --> 1:40:42.660\n who would you be?\n\n1:40:42.660 --> 1:40:44.240\n Would I be modeling their brain state\n\n1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:46.400\n or would I just be in their body?\n\n1:40:46.400 --> 1:40:48.380\n You can choose the degree\n\n1:40:48.380 --> 1:40:50.580\n to which you're modeling their brain state.\n\n1:40:50.580 --> 1:40:54.300\n Cause you can still take a third person perspective\n\n1:40:54.300 --> 1:40:56.620\n and realize, you have to realize that you're.\n\n1:40:56.620 --> 1:40:58.660\n Can they be alive or can it be dead?\n\n1:41:00.540 --> 1:41:01.380\n No, oh.\n\n1:41:02.780 --> 1:41:04.420\n They would be brought back to life, right?\n\n1:41:04.420 --> 1:41:05.260\n If they're dead.\n\n1:41:05.260 --> 1:41:07.100\n Yeah, you can bring people back.\n\n1:41:07.100 --> 1:41:09.260\n Definitely Hitler or Stalin.\n\n1:41:09.260 --> 1:41:10.820\n I wanna understand evil.\n\n1:41:12.060 --> 1:41:15.020\n You would need to, oh, to experience what it feels like.\n\n1:41:15.020 --> 1:41:18.220\n I wanna be in their brain feeling what they feel.\n\n1:41:18.220 --> 1:41:20.860\n I might change you forever returning from that.\n\n1:41:20.860 --> 1:41:22.940\n Yes, but I think it would also help me understand\n\n1:41:22.940 --> 1:41:25.380\n how to prevent it and fix it.\n\n1:41:25.380 --> 1:41:26.580\n That might be one of those things,\n\n1:41:26.580 --> 1:41:29.940\n once you experience it, it'll be a burden to know it.\n\n1:41:29.940 --> 1:41:30.780\n Cause you won't be able to transfer that.\n\n1:41:30.780 --> 1:41:33.820\n Yeah, but a lot of things are burdens.\n\n1:41:33.820 --> 1:41:34.780\n But it's a useful burden.\n\n1:41:34.780 --> 1:41:36.580\n But it's a useful burden, yeah.\n\n1:41:36.580 --> 1:41:39.260\n That for sure, I wanna understand evil\n\n1:41:39.260 --> 1:41:42.020\n and psychopathy and that.\n\n1:41:42.020 --> 1:41:43.340\n I have all these fake Twitter accounts\n\n1:41:43.340 --> 1:41:45.580\n where I go into different algorithmic bubbles\n\n1:41:45.580 --> 1:41:47.380\n to try to understand.\n\n1:41:47.380 --> 1:41:48.740\n I'll keep getting in fights with people\n\n1:41:48.740 --> 1:41:50.660\n and realize we're not actually fighting.\n\n1:41:50.660 --> 1:41:53.180\n I think we used to exist in a monoculture\n\n1:41:53.180 --> 1:41:54.860\n before social media and stuff.\n\n1:41:54.860 --> 1:41:56.460\n We kinda all got fed the same thing.\n\n1:41:56.460 --> 1:41:58.700\n So we were all speaking the same cultural language.\n\n1:41:58.700 --> 1:42:00.140\n But I think recently, one of the things\n\n1:42:00.140 --> 1:42:03.100\n that we aren't diagnosing properly enough with social media\n\n1:42:03.100 --> 1:42:05.500\n is that there's different dialects.\n\n1:42:05.500 --> 1:42:06.900\n There's so many different dialects of Chinese.\n\n1:42:06.900 --> 1:42:09.580\n There are now becoming different dialects of English.\n\n1:42:09.580 --> 1:42:11.780\n I am realizing there are people\n\n1:42:11.780 --> 1:42:13.540\n who are saying the exact same things,\n\n1:42:13.540 --> 1:42:15.980\n but they're using completely different verbiage.\n\n1:42:15.980 --> 1:42:17.340\n And we're punishing each other\n\n1:42:17.340 --> 1:42:18.900\n for not using the correct verbiage.\n\n1:42:18.900 --> 1:42:20.620\n And we're completely misunderstanding.\n\n1:42:20.620 --> 1:42:22.020\n People are just misunderstanding\n\n1:42:22.020 --> 1:42:23.580\n what the other people are saying.\n\n1:42:23.580 --> 1:42:26.220\n And I just got in a fight with a friend\n\n1:42:27.460 --> 1:42:32.460\n about anarchism and communism and shit for two hours.\n\n1:42:33.020 --> 1:42:34.700\n And then by the end of a conversation,\n\n1:42:34.700 --> 1:42:35.940\n and then she'd say something, and I'm like,\n\n1:42:35.940 --> 1:42:37.620\n but that's literally what I'm saying.\n\n1:42:37.620 --> 1:42:39.340\n And she was like, what?\n\n1:42:39.340 --> 1:42:40.900\n And then I was like, fuck, we've different,\n\n1:42:40.900 --> 1:42:44.820\n I'm like, our English, the way we are understanding\n\n1:42:44.820 --> 1:42:49.820\n terminology is like drastically, like our algorithm bubbles\n\n1:42:50.580 --> 1:42:53.380\n are creating mini dialects.\n\n1:42:53.380 --> 1:42:55.900\n Of how language is interpreted, how language is used.\n\n1:42:55.900 --> 1:42:56.860\n That's so fascinating.\n\n1:42:56.860 --> 1:42:59.220\n And so we're like having these arguments\n\n1:42:59.220 --> 1:43:00.980\n that we do not need to be having.\n\n1:43:00.980 --> 1:43:02.380\n And there's polarization that's happening\n\n1:43:02.380 --> 1:43:03.420\n that doesn't need to be happening\n\n1:43:03.420 --> 1:43:06.460\n because we've got these like algorithmically created\n\n1:43:08.620 --> 1:43:09.820\n dialects occurring.\n\n1:43:09.820 --> 1:43:11.980\n Plus on top of that, there's also different parts\n\n1:43:11.980 --> 1:43:13.460\n of the world that speak different languages.\n\n1:43:13.460 --> 1:43:16.220\n So there's literally lost in translation\n\n1:43:16.220 --> 1:43:17.820\n kind of communication.\n\n1:43:17.820 --> 1:43:19.780\n I happen to know the Russian language\n\n1:43:19.780 --> 1:43:22.420\n and just know how different it is.\n\n1:43:22.420 --> 1:43:23.900\n Then the English language.\n\n1:43:23.900 --> 1:43:27.660\n And I just wonder how much is lost in a little bit of.\n\n1:43:27.660 --> 1:43:28.980\n Man, I actually, cause I have a question for you.\n\n1:43:28.980 --> 1:43:30.260\n I have a song coming out tomorrow\n\n1:43:30.260 --> 1:43:31.900\n with I Speak Who Are A Russian Band.\n\n1:43:31.900 --> 1:43:33.700\n And I speak a little bit of Russian\n\n1:43:33.700 --> 1:43:35.380\n and I was looking at the title\n\n1:43:35.380 --> 1:43:37.300\n and the title in English doesn't match\n\n1:43:37.300 --> 1:43:38.220\n the title in Russian.\n\n1:43:38.220 --> 1:43:39.140\n I'm curious about this.\n\n1:43:39.140 --> 1:43:42.940\n Cause look, it says the title in English is Last Day.\n\n1:43:42.940 --> 1:43:45.580\n And then the title in Russian is New Day.\n\n1:43:45.580 --> 1:43:47.540\n My pronunciation sucks.\n\n1:43:47.540 --> 1:43:48.780\n New Day.\n\n1:43:48.780 --> 1:43:49.620\n Like what?\n\n1:43:49.620 --> 1:43:50.460\n Like a new day.\n\n1:43:50.460 --> 1:43:51.300\n A new day.\n\n1:43:51.300 --> 1:43:52.140\n Yeah, new day, new day.\n\n1:43:52.140 --> 1:43:53.340\n Like it's two different meanings.\n\n1:43:53.340 --> 1:43:54.820\n Yeah, new day, yeah.\n\n1:43:57.220 --> 1:43:58.500\n Yeah, yeah, new day.\n\n1:43:58.500 --> 1:43:59.700\n New day, but last day.\n\n1:44:01.340 --> 1:44:02.260\n New day.\n\n1:44:02.260 --> 1:44:04.220\n So last day would be the last day.\n\n1:44:04.220 --> 1:44:05.060\n Yeah.\n\n1:44:05.060 --> 1:44:05.900\n Maybe they.\n\n1:44:05.900 --> 1:44:07.580\n Or maybe the title includes both the Russian\n\n1:44:07.580 --> 1:44:09.060\n and it's for.\n\n1:44:09.060 --> 1:44:09.900\n Maybe.\n\n1:44:09.900 --> 1:44:10.740\n Maybe it's for bilingual.\n\n1:44:10.740 --> 1:44:13.220\n But to be honest, Novodin sounds better than\n\n1:44:13.220 --> 1:44:15.140\n just musically.\n\n1:44:15.140 --> 1:44:17.780\n Like Novodin is new day.\n\n1:44:17.780 --> 1:44:18.780\n That's the current one.\n\n1:44:18.780 --> 1:44:22.140\n And Posledniy Den is the last day.\n\n1:44:23.460 --> 1:44:25.420\n I think Novodin.\n\n1:44:25.420 --> 1:44:26.660\n I don't like Novodin.\n\n1:44:26.660 --> 1:44:28.860\n But the meaning is so different.\n\n1:44:30.180 --> 1:44:31.660\n That's kind of awesome actually though.\n\n1:44:31.660 --> 1:44:34.500\n There's an explicit sort of contrast like that.\n\n1:44:35.820 --> 1:44:38.340\n If everyone on earth disappeared\n\n1:44:38.340 --> 1:44:43.340\n and it was just you left, what would your day look like?\n\n1:44:44.060 --> 1:44:45.220\n Like what would you do?\n\n1:44:45.220 --> 1:44:46.780\n Everybody's dead.\n\n1:44:46.780 --> 1:44:47.620\n As far as you.\n\n1:44:47.620 --> 1:44:48.660\n Are there corpses there?\n\n1:44:52.500 --> 1:44:53.340\n Well seriously, it's a big.\n\n1:44:53.340 --> 1:44:54.780\n Let me think through this.\n\n1:44:54.780 --> 1:44:56.940\n It's a big difference if there's just like birds singing\n\n1:44:56.940 --> 1:44:58.940\n versus if there's like corpses littering the street.\n\n1:44:58.940 --> 1:45:01.860\n Yeah, there's corpses everywhere, I'm sorry.\n\n1:45:01.860 --> 1:45:05.060\n It's, and you don't actually know what happened\n\n1:45:05.060 --> 1:45:07.540\n and you don't know why you survived.\n\n1:45:07.540 --> 1:45:10.420\n And you don't even know if there's others out there.\n\n1:45:10.420 --> 1:45:13.580\n But it seems clear that it's all gone.\n\n1:45:13.580 --> 1:45:15.220\n What would you do?\n\n1:45:15.220 --> 1:45:16.100\n What would I do?\n\n1:45:17.300 --> 1:45:19.580\n Listen, I'm somebody who really enjoys the moment,\n\n1:45:19.580 --> 1:45:20.420\n enjoys life.\n\n1:45:20.420 --> 1:45:25.420\n I would just go on like enjoying the inanimate objects.\n\n1:45:26.380 --> 1:45:30.580\n I would just look for food, basic survival.\n\n1:45:30.580 --> 1:45:33.500\n But most of it is just, listen, when I just,\n\n1:45:33.500 --> 1:45:36.860\n I take walks and I look outside and I'm just happy\n\n1:45:36.860 --> 1:45:38.700\n that we get to exist on this planet,\n\n1:45:39.660 --> 1:45:41.980\n to be able to breathe air.\n\n1:45:41.980 --> 1:45:43.060\n It's just all beautiful.\n\n1:45:43.060 --> 1:45:44.820\n It's full of colors, all of this kind of stuff.\n\n1:45:44.820 --> 1:45:48.180\n Just, there's so many things about life,\n\n1:45:48.180 --> 1:45:50.780\n your own life, conscious life that's fucking awesome.\n\n1:45:50.780 --> 1:45:52.140\n So I would just enjoy that.\n\n1:45:54.220 --> 1:45:56.860\n But also maybe after a few weeks,\n\n1:45:56.860 --> 1:45:58.460\n the engineer would start coming out,\n\n1:45:58.460 --> 1:46:01.580\n like wanna build some things.\n\n1:46:01.580 --> 1:46:05.660\n Maybe there's always hope searching for another human.\n\n1:46:05.660 --> 1:46:06.500\n Maybe.\n\n1:46:06.500 --> 1:46:09.340\n Probably searching for another human.\n\n1:46:09.340 --> 1:46:13.100\n Probably trying to get to a TV or radio station\n\n1:46:13.100 --> 1:46:16.700\n and broadcast something.\n\n1:46:18.340 --> 1:46:19.860\n That's interesting, I didn't think about that.\n\n1:46:19.860 --> 1:46:23.460\n So like really maximize your ability\n\n1:46:23.460 --> 1:46:24.500\n to connect with others.\n\n1:46:24.500 --> 1:46:29.220\n Yeah, like probably try to find another person.\n\n1:46:29.220 --> 1:46:31.500\n Would you be excited to see,\n\n1:46:31.500 --> 1:46:33.380\n to meet another person or terrified?\n\n1:46:33.380 --> 1:46:34.900\n Because, you know.\n\n1:46:34.900 --> 1:46:35.740\n I'd be excited.\n\n1:46:35.740 --> 1:46:36.580\n No matter what.\n\n1:46:36.580 --> 1:46:38.220\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:46:38.220 --> 1:46:42.180\n Being alone for the last however long of my life\n\n1:46:42.180 --> 1:46:43.580\n would be really bad.\n\n1:46:43.580 --> 1:46:46.100\n That's the one instance I might,\n\n1:46:46.100 --> 1:46:47.220\n I don't think I'd kill myself,\n\n1:46:47.220 --> 1:46:48.740\n but I might kill myself if I had to.\n\n1:46:48.740 --> 1:46:50.140\n So you love people.\n\n1:46:50.140 --> 1:46:51.900\n You love connection to other humans.\n\n1:46:51.900 --> 1:46:52.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:46:52.740 --> 1:46:54.500\n I kinda hate people too, but yeah.\n\n1:46:54.500 --> 1:46:56.420\n That's a love hate relationship.\n\n1:46:56.420 --> 1:46:57.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:46:57.260 --> 1:46:58.380\n I feel like we'd have a bunch of weird\n\n1:46:58.380 --> 1:47:00.540\n Nietzsche questions and stuff though.\n\n1:47:00.540 --> 1:47:01.380\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:47:01.380 --> 1:47:02.980\n Like I wonder, cause I'm like, when podcast,\n\n1:47:02.980 --> 1:47:04.340\n I'm like, is this interesting for people\n\n1:47:04.340 --> 1:47:06.500\n to just have like, or I don't know,\n\n1:47:06.500 --> 1:47:08.380\n maybe people do like this.\n\n1:47:08.380 --> 1:47:10.460\n When I listen to podcasts, I'm into like the lore,\n\n1:47:10.460 --> 1:47:11.900\n like the hard lore.\n\n1:47:11.900 --> 1:47:13.380\n Like I just love like Dan Carlin.\n\n1:47:13.380 --> 1:47:14.500\n I'm like, give me the facts.\n\n1:47:14.500 --> 1:47:18.740\n Just like, like the facts into my bloodstream.\n\n1:47:18.740 --> 1:47:20.700\n But you also don't know,\n\n1:47:20.700 --> 1:47:23.300\n like you're a fascinating mind to explore.\n\n1:47:23.300 --> 1:47:26.340\n So you don't realize as you're talking about stuff,\n\n1:47:26.340 --> 1:47:28.420\n the stuff you've taken for granted\n\n1:47:28.420 --> 1:47:30.420\n is actually unique and fascinating.\n\n1:47:30.420 --> 1:47:32.060\n The way you think.\n\n1:47:32.060 --> 1:47:35.780\n Not always what, like the way you reason through things\n\n1:47:35.780 --> 1:47:39.420\n is the fascinating thing to listen to.\n\n1:47:39.420 --> 1:47:41.060\n Because people kind of see, oh,\n\n1:47:41.060 --> 1:47:43.420\n there's other humans that think differently,\n\n1:47:43.420 --> 1:47:45.380\n that explore thoughts differently.\n\n1:47:45.380 --> 1:47:47.540\n That's the cool, that's also cool.\n\n1:47:47.540 --> 1:47:50.180\n So yeah, Dan Carlin retelling of history.\n\n1:47:50.180 --> 1:47:54.820\n By the way, his retelling of history is very,\n\n1:47:54.820 --> 1:47:57.060\n I think what's exciting is not the history,\n\n1:47:57.060 --> 1:48:00.340\n is his way of thinking about history.\n\n1:48:00.340 --> 1:48:02.700\n No, I think Dan Carlin is one of the people,\n\n1:48:02.700 --> 1:48:04.380\n like when, Dan Carlin is one of the people\n\n1:48:04.380 --> 1:48:06.140\n that really started getting me excited\n\n1:48:06.140 --> 1:48:08.900\n about like revolutionizing education.\n\n1:48:08.900 --> 1:48:12.700\n Because like Dan Carlin instilled,\n\n1:48:12.700 --> 1:48:14.380\n I already like really liked history,\n\n1:48:14.380 --> 1:48:18.940\n but he instilled like an obsessive love of history in me\n\n1:48:18.940 --> 1:48:21.260\n to the point where like now I'm fucking reading,\n\n1:48:21.260 --> 1:48:24.940\n like going to bed, reading like part four\n\n1:48:24.940 --> 1:48:26.740\n of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich or whatever.\n\n1:48:26.740 --> 1:48:28.740\n Like I got like dense ass history,\n\n1:48:28.740 --> 1:48:31.300\n but like he like opened that door\n\n1:48:31.300 --> 1:48:34.300\n that like made me want to be a scholar of that topic.\n\n1:48:34.300 --> 1:48:37.740\n Like it's like, I feel like he's such a good teacher.\n\n1:48:37.740 --> 1:48:41.300\n He just like, you know, and it sort of made me feel like\n\n1:48:42.260 --> 1:48:44.060\n one of the things we could do with education\n\n1:48:44.060 --> 1:48:46.540\n is like find like the world's great,\n\n1:48:46.540 --> 1:48:49.780\n the teachers that like create passion for the topic\n\n1:48:49.780 --> 1:48:53.580\n because autodidactricism,\n\n1:48:53.580 --> 1:48:55.140\n I don't know how to say that properly,\n\n1:48:55.140 --> 1:48:57.900\n but like self teaching is like much faster\n\n1:48:57.900 --> 1:48:59.460\n than being lectured to.\n\n1:48:59.460 --> 1:49:00.660\n Like it's much more efficient\n\n1:49:00.660 --> 1:49:02.300\n to sort of like be able to teach yourself\n\n1:49:02.300 --> 1:49:03.700\n and then ask a teacher questions\n\n1:49:03.700 --> 1:49:04.860\n when you don't know what's up.\n\n1:49:04.860 --> 1:49:07.380\n But like, you know, that's why it's like\n\n1:49:07.380 --> 1:49:08.380\n in university and stuff,\n\n1:49:08.380 --> 1:49:11.060\n like you can learn so much more material so much faster\n\n1:49:11.060 --> 1:49:13.340\n because you're doing a lot of the learning on your own\n\n1:49:13.340 --> 1:49:15.620\n and you're going to the teachers for when you get stuck.\n\n1:49:15.620 --> 1:49:18.980\n But like these teachers that can inspire passion\n\n1:49:18.980 --> 1:49:21.660\n for a topic, I think that is one of the most invaluable\n\n1:49:21.660 --> 1:49:23.180\n skills in our whole species.\n\n1:49:23.180 --> 1:49:26.460\n Like, because if you can do that, then you,\n\n1:49:26.460 --> 1:49:30.420\n it's like AI, like AI is going to teach itself\n\n1:49:30.420 --> 1:49:31.820\n so much more efficiently than we can teach it.\n\n1:49:31.820 --> 1:49:32.900\n We just needed to get it to the point\n\n1:49:32.900 --> 1:49:34.340\n where it can teach itself.\n\n1:49:34.340 --> 1:49:35.180\n And then.\n\n1:49:35.180 --> 1:49:37.500\n It finds the motivation to do so, right?\n\n1:49:37.500 --> 1:49:38.340\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:38.340 --> 1:49:39.580\n So like you inspire it to do so.\n\n1:49:39.580 --> 1:49:40.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:40.420 --> 1:49:42.660\n And then it could teach itself.\n\n1:49:42.660 --> 1:49:44.540\n What do you make of the fact,\n\n1:49:44.540 --> 1:49:46.340\n you mentioned Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\n\n1:49:46.340 --> 1:49:47.180\n I just.\n\n1:49:47.180 --> 1:49:48.000\n Have you read that?\n\n1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:48.840\n Yeah, I read it twice.\n\n1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:49.680\n You read it twice?\n\n1:49:49.680 --> 1:49:50.500\n Yes.\n\n1:49:50.500 --> 1:49:51.620\n Okay, so no one even knows what it is.\n\n1:49:51.620 --> 1:49:52.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:52.460 --> 1:49:53.300\n And I'm like, wait, I thought this was like\n\n1:49:53.300 --> 1:49:54.820\n a super poppin book.\n\n1:49:54.820 --> 1:49:55.660\n Super pop.\n\n1:49:55.660 --> 1:49:58.460\n Yeah, I'm not like that, I'm not that far in it.\n\n1:49:58.460 --> 1:50:00.260\n But it is, it's so interesting.\n\n1:50:00.260 --> 1:50:03.500\n Yeah, it's written by a person that was there,\n\n1:50:03.500 --> 1:50:05.860\n which is very important to kind of.\n\n1:50:05.860 --> 1:50:06.980\n You know, you start being like,\n\n1:50:06.980 --> 1:50:08.420\n how could this possibly happen?\n\n1:50:08.420 --> 1:50:10.020\n And then when you read Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,\n\n1:50:10.020 --> 1:50:14.020\n it's like, people tried really hard for this to not happen.\n\n1:50:14.020 --> 1:50:15.940\n People tried, they almost reinstated a monarchy\n\n1:50:15.940 --> 1:50:17.940\n at one point to try to stop this from happening.\n\n1:50:17.940 --> 1:50:21.060\n Like they almost like abandoned democracy\n\n1:50:21.060 --> 1:50:22.700\n to try to get this to not happen.\n\n1:50:22.700 --> 1:50:24.780\n At least the way it makes me feel\n\n1:50:24.780 --> 1:50:28.180\n is that there's a bunch of small moments\n\n1:50:28.180 --> 1:50:30.100\n on which history can turn.\n\n1:50:30.100 --> 1:50:30.940\n Yes.\n\n1:50:30.940 --> 1:50:32.260\n It's like small meetings.\n\n1:50:32.260 --> 1:50:33.100\n Yes.\n\n1:50:33.100 --> 1:50:34.220\n Human interactions.\n\n1:50:34.220 --> 1:50:36.900\n And it's both terrifying and inspiring\n\n1:50:36.900 --> 1:50:41.900\n because it's like, even just attempts\n\n1:50:41.940 --> 1:50:46.940\n at assassinating Hitler, like time and time again failed.\n\n1:50:47.340 --> 1:50:48.180\n And they were so close.\n\n1:50:48.180 --> 1:50:49.820\n Was it like Operation Valkyrie?\n\n1:50:49.820 --> 1:50:51.700\n Such a good.\n\n1:50:51.700 --> 1:50:55.100\n And then there's also the role of,\n\n1:50:55.100 --> 1:50:56.500\n that's a really heavy burden,\n\n1:50:56.500 --> 1:50:59.060\n which is from a geopolitical perspective,\n\n1:50:59.060 --> 1:51:00.820\n the role of leaders to see evil\n\n1:51:00.820 --> 1:51:02.500\n before it truly becomes evil,\n\n1:51:02.500 --> 1:51:05.460\n to anticipate it, to stand up to evil.\n\n1:51:05.460 --> 1:51:08.140\n Because evil is actually pretty rare in this world\n\n1:51:08.140 --> 1:51:09.380\n at a scale that Hitler was.\n\n1:51:09.380 --> 1:51:12.020\n We tend to, you know, in the modern discourse\n\n1:51:12.020 --> 1:51:14.020\n kind of call people evil too quickly.\n\n1:51:14.020 --> 1:51:17.380\n If you look at ancient history,\n\n1:51:17.380 --> 1:51:18.860\n like there was a ton of Hitlers.\n\n1:51:18.860 --> 1:51:22.660\n I actually think it's more the norm than,\n\n1:51:22.660 --> 1:51:24.420\n like again, going back to like my\n\n1:51:24.420 --> 1:51:25.900\n sort of intelligent design theory,\n\n1:51:25.900 --> 1:51:28.380\n I think one of the things we've been successfully doing\n\n1:51:28.380 --> 1:51:31.340\n in our slow move from survival of the fittest\n\n1:51:31.340 --> 1:51:36.340\n to intelligent design is we've kind of been eradicating,\n\n1:51:37.700 --> 1:51:40.060\n like if you look at like ancient Assyria and stuff,\n\n1:51:40.060 --> 1:51:42.460\n like that shit was like brutal\n\n1:51:42.460 --> 1:51:45.860\n and just like the heads on the, like brutal,\n\n1:51:45.860 --> 1:51:48.460\n like Genghis Khan just like genocide after genocide\n\n1:51:48.460 --> 1:51:51.100\n was like throwing plague bodies over the walls\n\n1:51:51.100 --> 1:51:52.660\n and decimating whole cities\n\n1:51:52.660 --> 1:51:55.820\n or like the Muslim conquests of like Damascus and shit.\n\n1:51:55.820 --> 1:51:58.780\n Just like people, cities used to get leveled\n\n1:51:58.780 --> 1:52:00.060\n all the fucking time.\n\n1:52:00.060 --> 1:52:02.460\n Okay, get into the Bronze Age collapse.\n\n1:52:02.460 --> 1:52:05.140\n It's basically, there was like almost\n\n1:52:05.140 --> 1:52:07.940\n like Roman level like society.\n\n1:52:07.940 --> 1:52:09.420\n Like there was like all over the world,\n\n1:52:09.420 --> 1:52:11.820\n like global trade, like everything was awesome\n\n1:52:11.820 --> 1:52:13.820\n through a mix of, I think a bit of climate change\n\n1:52:13.820 --> 1:52:16.020\n and then the development of iron\n\n1:52:16.020 --> 1:52:17.420\n because basically bronze could only come\n\n1:52:17.420 --> 1:52:19.540\n from this, the way to make bronze,\n\n1:52:19.540 --> 1:52:20.700\n like everything had to be funneled\n\n1:52:20.700 --> 1:52:23.340\n through this one Iranian mine.\n\n1:52:23.340 --> 1:52:26.740\n And so it's like, there was just this one supply chain\n\n1:52:26.740 --> 1:52:27.580\n and this is one of the things\n\n1:52:27.580 --> 1:52:29.140\n that makes me worried about supply chains\n\n1:52:29.140 --> 1:52:31.580\n and why I think we need to be so thoughtful about,\n\n1:52:31.580 --> 1:52:34.500\n I think our biggest issue with society right now,\n\n1:52:34.500 --> 1:52:36.460\n like the thing that is most likely to go wrong\n\n1:52:36.460 --> 1:52:38.860\n is probably supply chain collapse,\n\n1:52:38.860 --> 1:52:40.140\n because war, climate change, whatever,\n\n1:52:40.140 --> 1:52:41.860\n like anything that causes supply chain collapse,\n\n1:52:41.860 --> 1:52:44.260\n our population is too big to handle that.\n\n1:52:44.260 --> 1:52:46.300\n And like the thing that seems to cause Dark Ages\n\n1:52:46.300 --> 1:52:48.020\n is mass supply chain collapse.\n\n1:52:48.020 --> 1:52:51.820\n But the Bronze Age collapse happened like,\n\n1:52:52.860 --> 1:52:55.380\n it was sort of like this ancient collapse\n\n1:52:55.380 --> 1:52:59.340\n that happened where like literally like ancient Egypt,\n\n1:52:59.340 --> 1:53:01.740\n all these cities, everything just got like decimated,\n\n1:53:01.740 --> 1:53:04.500\n destroyed, abandoned cities, like hundreds of them.\n\n1:53:04.500 --> 1:53:05.980\n There was like a flourishing society,\n\n1:53:05.980 --> 1:53:07.420\n like we were almost coming to modernity\n\n1:53:07.420 --> 1:53:08.500\n and everything got leveled.\n\n1:53:08.500 --> 1:53:10.060\n And they had this mini Dark Ages,\n\n1:53:10.060 --> 1:53:12.140\n but it was just like, there's so little writing\n\n1:53:12.140 --> 1:53:13.700\n or recording from that time that like,\n\n1:53:13.700 --> 1:53:14.820\n there isn't a lot of information\n\n1:53:14.820 --> 1:53:16.300\n about the Bronze Age collapse,\n\n1:53:16.300 --> 1:53:18.780\n but it was basically equivalent to like medieval,\n\n1:53:18.780 --> 1:53:21.220\n the medieval Dark Ages.\n\n1:53:21.220 --> 1:53:23.620\n But it just happened, I don't know the years,\n\n1:53:23.620 --> 1:53:26.500\n but like thousands of years earlier.\n\n1:53:26.500 --> 1:53:28.660\n And then we sort of like recovered\n\n1:53:28.660 --> 1:53:30.780\n from the Bronze Age collapse,\n\n1:53:30.780 --> 1:53:33.820\n empire reemerged, writing and trade\n\n1:53:33.820 --> 1:53:35.140\n and everything reemerged.\n\n1:53:36.660 --> 1:53:39.980\n And then we of course had the more contemporary Dark Ages.\n\n1:53:40.900 --> 1:53:43.140\n And then over time, we've designed mechanism\n\n1:53:43.140 --> 1:53:46.420\n to lessen and lessen the capability\n\n1:53:46.420 --> 1:53:50.540\n for the destructive power centers to emerge.\n\n1:53:50.540 --> 1:53:54.260\n There's more recording about the more contemporary Dark Ages.\n\n1:53:54.260 --> 1:53:55.660\n So I think we have like a better understanding\n\n1:53:55.660 --> 1:53:56.500\n of how to avoid it,\n\n1:53:56.500 --> 1:53:58.140\n but I still think we're at high risk for it.\n\n1:53:58.140 --> 1:54:00.660\n I think that's one of the big risks right now.\n\n1:54:00.660 --> 1:54:03.260\n So the natural state of being for humans\n\n1:54:03.260 --> 1:54:04.940\n is for there to be a lot of Hitlers,\n\n1:54:04.940 --> 1:54:06.780\n which has gotten really good\n\n1:54:06.780 --> 1:54:09.980\n at making it hard for them to emerge.\n\n1:54:09.980 --> 1:54:12.700\n We've gotten better at collaboration\n\n1:54:12.700 --> 1:54:14.820\n and resisting the power,\n\n1:54:14.820 --> 1:54:16.860\n like authoritarians to come to power.\n\n1:54:16.860 --> 1:54:18.580\n We're trying to go country by country,\n\n1:54:18.580 --> 1:54:19.900\n like we're moving past this.\n\n1:54:19.900 --> 1:54:21.500\n We're kind of like slowly incrementally,\n\n1:54:21.500 --> 1:54:26.500\n like moving towards like not scary old school war stuff.\n\n1:54:29.180 --> 1:54:32.180\n And I think seeing it happen in some of the countries\n\n1:54:32.180 --> 1:54:33.860\n that at least nominally are like\n\n1:54:35.140 --> 1:54:36.740\n supposed to have moved past that,\n\n1:54:36.740 --> 1:54:39.780\n that's scary because it reminds us that it can happen\n\n1:54:39.780 --> 1:54:44.780\n like in the places that have moved supposedly,\n\n1:54:44.980 --> 1:54:47.060\n as hopefully moved past that.\n\n1:54:47.060 --> 1:54:49.420\n And possibly at a civilization level,\n\n1:54:49.420 --> 1:54:51.660\n like you said, supply chain collapse\n\n1:54:51.660 --> 1:54:54.300\n might make people resource constraint,\n\n1:54:54.300 --> 1:54:59.300\n might make people desperate, angry, hateful, violent,\n\n1:54:59.980 --> 1:55:01.500\n and drag us right back in.\n\n1:55:01.500 --> 1:55:03.980\n I mean, supply chain collapse is how,\n\n1:55:03.980 --> 1:55:06.260\n like the ultimate thing that caused the Middle Ages\n\n1:55:06.260 --> 1:55:08.260\n was supply chain collapse.\n\n1:55:08.260 --> 1:55:11.020\n It's like people, because people were reliant\n\n1:55:11.020 --> 1:55:12.380\n on a certain level of technology,\n\n1:55:12.380 --> 1:55:14.140\n like people, like you look at like Britain,\n\n1:55:14.140 --> 1:55:17.540\n like they had glass, like people had aqueducts,\n\n1:55:17.540 --> 1:55:20.420\n people had like indoor heating and cooling\n\n1:55:20.420 --> 1:55:23.380\n and like running water and like buy food\n\n1:55:23.380 --> 1:55:26.020\n from all over the world and trade and markets.\n\n1:55:26.020 --> 1:55:28.580\n Like people didn't know how to hunt and forage and gather.\n\n1:55:28.580 --> 1:55:29.820\n And so we're in a similar situation.\n\n1:55:29.820 --> 1:55:33.740\n We are not educated enough to survive without technology.\n\n1:55:33.740 --> 1:55:35.380\n So if we have a supply chain collapse\n\n1:55:35.380 --> 1:55:38.340\n that like limits our access to technology,\n\n1:55:38.340 --> 1:55:41.300\n there will be like massive starvation and violence\n\n1:55:41.300 --> 1:55:43.100\n and displacement and war.\n\n1:55:43.100 --> 1:55:47.260\n Like, you know, it's like, yeah.\n\n1:55:47.260 --> 1:55:49.060\n In my opinion, it's like the primary marker\n\n1:55:49.060 --> 1:55:52.700\n of like what a dark age is.\n\n1:55:52.700 --> 1:55:54.380\n Well, technology is kind of enabling us\n\n1:55:54.380 --> 1:55:57.180\n to be more resilient in terms of supply chain,\n\n1:55:57.180 --> 1:56:00.820\n in terms of, to all the different catastrophic events\n\n1:56:00.820 --> 1:56:02.060\n that happened to us.\n\n1:56:02.060 --> 1:56:03.900\n Although the pandemic has kind of challenged\n\n1:56:03.900 --> 1:56:07.660\n our preparedness for the catastrophic.\n\n1:56:07.660 --> 1:56:09.220\n What do you think is the coolest invention\n\n1:56:09.220 --> 1:56:11.100\n humans come up with?\n\n1:56:11.100 --> 1:56:14.580\n The wheel, fire, cooking meat.\n\n1:56:14.580 --> 1:56:16.980\n Computers. Computers.\n\n1:56:16.980 --> 1:56:18.900\n Freaking computers. Internet or computers?\n\n1:56:18.900 --> 1:56:19.740\n Which one?\n\n1:56:19.740 --> 1:56:20.560\n What do you think the?\n\n1:56:20.560 --> 1:56:22.420\n Previous technologies, I mean,\n\n1:56:22.420 --> 1:56:23.680\n may have even been more profound\n\n1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:24.740\n and moved us to a certain degree,\n\n1:56:24.740 --> 1:56:27.340\n but I think the computers are what make us homo tech now.\n\n1:56:27.340 --> 1:56:30.760\n I think this is what, it's a brain augmentation.\n\n1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:33.820\n And so it like allows for actual evolution.\n\n1:56:33.820 --> 1:56:35.460\n Like the computers accelerate the degree\n\n1:56:35.460 --> 1:56:38.660\n to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated.\n\n1:56:38.660 --> 1:56:40.700\n Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien\n\n1:56:40.700 --> 1:56:41.580\n or a homo techno?\n\n1:56:41.580 --> 1:56:43.040\n Definitely homo techno.\n\n1:56:43.040 --> 1:56:46.940\n So you're one of the earliest of the species.\n\n1:56:46.940 --> 1:56:49.200\n I think most of us are.\n\n1:56:49.200 --> 1:56:51.620\n Like, as I said, like, I think if you\n\n1:56:53.780 --> 1:56:58.740\n like looked at brain scans of us versus humans\n\n1:56:58.740 --> 1:57:00.920\n a hundred years ago, it would look very different.\n\n1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:03.740\n I think we are physiologically different.\n\n1:57:03.740 --> 1:57:05.580\n Just even the interaction with the devices\n\n1:57:05.580 --> 1:57:06.700\n has changed our brains.\n\n1:57:06.700 --> 1:57:08.580\n Well, and if you look at,\n\n1:57:08.580 --> 1:57:11.220\n a lot of studies are coming out to show that like,\n\n1:57:11.220 --> 1:57:13.100\n there's a degree of inherited memory.\n\n1:57:13.100 --> 1:57:15.360\n So some of these physiological changes in theory\n\n1:57:15.360 --> 1:57:18.020\n should be, we should be passing them on.\n\n1:57:18.020 --> 1:57:21.660\n So like that's, you know, that's not like a,\n\n1:57:21.660 --> 1:57:23.180\n an instance of physiological change\n\n1:57:23.180 --> 1:57:24.140\n that's gonna fizzle out.\n\n1:57:24.140 --> 1:57:28.080\n In theory, that should progress like to our offspring.\n\n1:57:29.060 --> 1:57:30.420\n Speaking of offspring,\n\n1:57:30.420 --> 1:57:33.180\n what advice would you give to a young person,\n\n1:57:33.180 --> 1:57:34.360\n like in high school,\n\n1:57:35.660 --> 1:57:40.660\n whether there be an artist, a creative, an engineer,\n\n1:57:43.140 --> 1:57:46.300\n any kind of career path, or maybe just life in general,\n\n1:57:46.300 --> 1:57:48.700\n how they can live a life they can be proud of?\n\n1:57:48.700 --> 1:57:50.800\n I think one of my big thoughts,\n\n1:57:50.800 --> 1:57:53.180\n and like, especially now having kids,\n\n1:57:53.180 --> 1:57:55.460\n is that I don't think we spend enough time\n\n1:57:55.460 --> 1:57:56.820\n teaching creativity.\n\n1:57:56.820 --> 1:57:59.300\n And I think creativity is a muscle like other things.\n\n1:57:59.300 --> 1:58:01.740\n And there's a lot of emphasis on, you know,\n\n1:58:01.740 --> 1:58:02.860\n learn how to play the piano.\n\n1:58:02.860 --> 1:58:04.020\n And then you can write a song\n\n1:58:04.020 --> 1:58:05.460\n or like learn the technical stuff.\n\n1:58:05.460 --> 1:58:07.020\n And then you can do a thing.\n\n1:58:07.020 --> 1:58:10.460\n But I think it's, like, I have a friend\n\n1:58:10.460 --> 1:58:12.620\n who's like world's greatest guitar player,\n\n1:58:13.700 --> 1:58:15.740\n like, you know, amazing sort of like producer,\n\n1:58:15.740 --> 1:58:18.940\n works with other people, but he's really sort of like,\n\n1:58:18.940 --> 1:58:20.680\n you know, he like engineers and records things\n\n1:58:20.680 --> 1:58:21.740\n and like does solos,\n\n1:58:21.740 --> 1:58:23.480\n but he doesn't really like make his own music.\n\n1:58:23.480 --> 1:58:26.060\n And I was talking to him and I was like,\n\n1:58:26.060 --> 1:58:27.340\n dude, you're so talented at music.\n\n1:58:27.340 --> 1:58:28.860\n Like, why don't you make music or whatever?\n\n1:58:28.860 --> 1:58:32.100\n And he was like, cause I got, I'm too old.\n\n1:58:32.100 --> 1:58:34.180\n I never learned the creative muscle.\n\n1:58:34.180 --> 1:58:36.660\n And it's like, you know, it's embarrassing.\n\n1:58:36.660 --> 1:58:39.220\n It's like learning the creative muscle\n\n1:58:39.220 --> 1:58:40.760\n takes a lot of failure.\n\n1:58:40.760 --> 1:58:42.940\n And it also sort of,\n\n1:58:44.220 --> 1:58:45.700\n if when you're being creative,\n\n1:58:46.880 --> 1:58:48.140\n you know, you're throwing paint at a wall\n\n1:58:48.140 --> 1:58:49.460\n and a lot of stuff will fail.\n\n1:58:49.460 --> 1:58:51.180\n So like part of it is like a tolerance\n\n1:58:51.180 --> 1:58:53.020\n for failure and humiliation.\n\n1:58:53.020 --> 1:58:54.900\n And that's somehow that's easier to develop\n\n1:58:54.900 --> 1:58:57.380\n when you're young or be persist through it\n\n1:58:57.380 --> 1:58:58.220\n when you're young.\n\n1:58:58.220 --> 1:59:02.540\n Everything is easier to develop when you're young.\n\n1:59:02.540 --> 1:59:03.380\n Yes.\n\n1:59:03.380 --> 1:59:04.780\n And the younger, the better.\n\n1:59:04.780 --> 1:59:05.620\n It could destroy you.\n\n1:59:05.620 --> 1:59:08.460\n I mean, that's the shitty thing about creativity.\n\n1:59:08.460 --> 1:59:11.260\n If, you know, failure could destroy you\n\n1:59:11.260 --> 1:59:13.420\n if you're not careful, but that's a risk worth taking.\n\n1:59:13.420 --> 1:59:15.020\n But also, but at a young age,\n\n1:59:15.020 --> 1:59:17.820\n developing a tolerance to failure is good.\n\n1:59:17.820 --> 1:59:19.900\n I fail all the time.\n\n1:59:19.900 --> 1:59:22.380\n Like I do stupid shit all the time.\n\n1:59:22.380 --> 1:59:24.860\n Like in public, in private, I get canceled for,\n\n1:59:24.860 --> 1:59:27.060\n I've make all kinds of mistakes,\n\n1:59:27.060 --> 1:59:30.540\n but I just like am very resilient about making mistakes.\n\n1:59:30.540 --> 1:59:32.980\n And so then like I do a lot of things\n\n1:59:32.980 --> 1:59:34.180\n that like other people wouldn't do.\n\n1:59:34.180 --> 1:59:37.540\n And like, I think my greatest asset is my creativity.\n\n1:59:37.540 --> 1:59:39.840\n And I like, I think pain, like tolerance to failure\n\n1:59:39.840 --> 1:59:43.380\n is just a super essential thing\n\n1:59:43.380 --> 1:59:45.420\n that should be taught before other things.\n\n1:59:45.420 --> 1:59:46.340\n Brilliant advice.\n\n1:59:46.340 --> 1:59:47.420\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:59:47.420 --> 1:59:51.540\n I wish everybody encouraged sort of failure more\n\n1:59:51.540 --> 1:59:52.380\n as opposed to kind of.\n\n1:59:52.380 --> 1:59:53.460\n Cause we like punish failure.\n\n1:59:53.460 --> 1:59:55.340\n We're like, no, like when we were teaching kids,\n\n1:59:55.340 --> 1:59:56.380\n we're like, no, that's wrong.\n\n1:59:56.380 --> 2:00:01.380\n Like that's, you know, like X keeps like will be like wrong.\n\n2:00:04.380 --> 2:00:05.760\n Like he'll say like crazy things.\n\n2:00:05.760 --> 2:00:09.740\n Like X keeps being like, like bubble car, bubble car.\n\n2:00:09.740 --> 2:00:14.160\n And I'm like, and you know, I'm like, what's a bubble car?\n\n2:00:14.160 --> 2:00:15.860\n Like, but like, it doesn't like,\n\n2:00:15.860 --> 2:00:17.420\n but I don't want to be like, no, you're wrong.\n\n2:00:17.420 --> 2:00:20.340\n I'm like, you're thinking of weird, crazy shit.\n\n2:00:20.340 --> 2:00:22.260\n Like, I don't know what a bubble car is, but like.\n\n2:00:22.260 --> 2:00:23.460\n It's creating worlds\n\n2:00:23.460 --> 2:00:25.180\n and they might be internally consistent.\n\n2:00:25.180 --> 2:00:27.420\n And through that, you might discover something fundamental\n\n2:00:27.420 --> 2:00:28.260\n about this world.\n\n2:00:28.260 --> 2:00:29.740\n Yeah, or he'll like rewrite songs,\n\n2:00:29.740 --> 2:00:32.140\n like with words that he prefers.\n\n2:00:32.140 --> 2:00:34.580\n So like, instead of baby shark, he says baby car.\n\n2:00:35.500 --> 2:00:36.340\n It's like.\n\n2:00:36.340 --> 2:00:41.100\n Maybe he's onto something.\n\n2:00:41.100 --> 2:00:42.740\n Let me ask the big, ridiculous question.\n\n2:00:42.740 --> 2:00:44.100\n We were kind of dancing around it,\n\n2:00:44.100 --> 2:00:47.180\n but what do you think is the meaning\n\n2:00:47.180 --> 2:00:52.140\n of this whole thing we have here of human civilization,\n\n2:00:52.140 --> 2:00:55.060\n of life on earth, but in general, just life?\n\n2:00:55.060 --> 2:00:57.340\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n2:00:57.340 --> 2:00:58.180\n C.\n\n2:00:58.180 --> 2:01:02.540\n Have you, did you read Nova Scene yet?\n\n2:01:02.540 --> 2:01:03.700\n By James Lovelock?\n\n2:01:03.700 --> 2:01:06.340\n You're doing a lot of really good book recommendations here.\n\n2:01:06.340 --> 2:01:07.560\n I haven't even finished this,\n\n2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:10.260\n so I'm a huge fraud yet again.\n\n2:01:10.260 --> 2:01:12.620\n But like really early in the book,\n\n2:01:12.620 --> 2:01:14.500\n he says this amazing thing.\n\n2:01:14.500 --> 2:01:16.500\n Like, I feel like everyone's so sad and cynical.\n\n2:01:16.500 --> 2:01:18.700\n Like everyone's like the Fermi paradox and everyone.\n\n2:01:18.700 --> 2:01:20.500\n I just keep hearing people being like, fuck,\n\n2:01:20.500 --> 2:01:21.340\n what if we're alone?\n\n2:01:21.340 --> 2:01:23.620\n Like, oh no, ah, like, ah, ah.\n\n2:01:23.620 --> 2:01:25.100\n And I'm like, okay, but like, wait,\n\n2:01:25.100 --> 2:01:26.780\n what if this is the beginning?\n\n2:01:26.780 --> 2:01:28.460\n Like in Nova Scene, he says,\n\n2:01:30.140 --> 2:01:31.380\n this is not gonna be a correct,\n\n2:01:31.380 --> 2:01:32.580\n I can't like memorize quotes,\n\n2:01:32.580 --> 2:01:34.260\n but he says something like,\n\n2:01:36.260 --> 2:01:39.980\n what if our consciousness, like right now,\n\n2:01:39.980 --> 2:01:43.380\n like this is the universe waking up?\n\n2:01:43.380 --> 2:01:45.500\n Like what if instead of discovering the universe,\n\n2:01:45.500 --> 2:01:47.460\n this is the universe,\n\n2:01:47.460 --> 2:01:49.460\n like this is the evolution\n\n2:01:49.460 --> 2:01:51.620\n of the literal universe herself.\n\n2:01:51.620 --> 2:01:53.140\n Like we are not separate from the universe.\n\n2:01:53.140 --> 2:01:54.620\n Like this is the universe waking up.\n\n2:01:54.620 --> 2:01:57.400\n This is the universe seeing herself for the first time.\n\n2:01:57.400 --> 2:01:58.240\n Like this is.\n\n2:01:59.140 --> 2:02:00.820\n The universe becoming conscious.\n\n2:02:00.820 --> 2:02:02.340\n The first time we were a part of that.\n\n2:02:02.340 --> 2:02:03.180\n Yeah, cause it's like,\n\n2:02:03.180 --> 2:02:05.620\n we aren't separate from the universe.\n\n2:02:05.620 --> 2:02:08.780\n Like this could be like an incredibly sacred moment\n\n2:02:08.780 --> 2:02:10.980\n and maybe like social media and all this things,\n\n2:02:10.980 --> 2:02:13.300\n the stuff where we're all getting connected together.\n\n2:02:13.300 --> 2:02:16.940\n Like maybe these are the neurons connecting\n\n2:02:16.940 --> 2:02:20.900\n of the like collective super intelligence that is,\n\n2:02:22.100 --> 2:02:22.940\n Waking up.\n\n2:02:22.940 --> 2:02:25.420\n The, yeah, like, you know, it's like,\n\n2:02:25.420 --> 2:02:27.100\n maybe instead of something cynical\n\n2:02:27.100 --> 2:02:29.180\n or maybe if there's something to discover,\n\n2:02:29.180 --> 2:02:31.540\n like maybe this is just, you know,\n\n2:02:31.540 --> 2:02:35.980\n we're a blast assist of like some incredible\n\n2:02:35.980 --> 2:02:39.420\n kind of consciousness or being.\n\n2:02:39.420 --> 2:02:41.220\n And just like in the first three years of life\n\n2:02:41.220 --> 2:02:42.820\n or for human children,\n\n2:02:42.820 --> 2:02:44.340\n we'll forget about all the suffering\n\n2:02:44.340 --> 2:02:45.460\n that we're going through now.\n\n2:02:45.460 --> 2:02:46.620\n I think we'll probably forget about this.\n\n2:02:46.620 --> 2:02:50.440\n I mean, probably, you know, artificial intelligence\n\n2:02:50.440 --> 2:02:52.700\n will eventually render us obsolete.\n\n2:02:52.700 --> 2:02:55.380\n I don't think they'll do it in a malicious way,\n\n2:02:55.380 --> 2:02:57.760\n but I think probably we are very weak.\n\n2:02:57.760 --> 2:02:58.880\n The sun is expanding.\n\n2:02:58.880 --> 2:03:01.660\n Like, I don't know, like, hopefully we can get to Mars,\n\n2:03:01.660 --> 2:03:04.100\n but like, we're pretty vulnerable.\n\n2:03:04.100 --> 2:03:06.780\n And I, you know, like,\n\n2:03:06.780 --> 2:03:09.100\n I think we can coexist for a long time with AI\n\n2:03:09.100 --> 2:03:11.460\n and we can also probably make ourselves less vulnerable,\n\n2:03:11.460 --> 2:03:13.580\n but, you know, I just think\n\n2:03:15.700 --> 2:03:18.400\n consciousness, sentience, self awareness,\n\n2:03:18.400 --> 2:03:21.940\n like, I think this might be the single greatest\n\n2:03:21.940 --> 2:03:24.980\n like moment in evolution ever.\n\n2:03:24.980 --> 2:03:28.140\n And like, maybe this is, you know,\n\n2:03:29.300 --> 2:03:32.580\n the big, like the true beginning of life.\n\n2:03:32.580 --> 2:03:34.700\n And we're just, we're the blue green algae\n\n2:03:34.700 --> 2:03:36.980\n or we're like the single celled organisms\n\n2:03:36.980 --> 2:03:38.460\n of something amazing.\n\n2:03:38.460 --> 2:03:40.900\n The universe awakens and this is it.\n\n2:03:40.900 --> 2:03:41.740\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:42.620 --> 2:03:45.300\n Well, see, you're an incredible person.\n\n2:03:45.300 --> 2:03:47.500\n You're a fascinating mind.\n\n2:03:47.500 --> 2:03:50.500\n You should definitely do, your friend Liv mentioned\n\n2:03:50.500 --> 2:03:52.260\n that you guys were thinking of maybe talking.\n\n2:03:52.260 --> 2:03:55.340\n I would love it if you explored your mind\n\n2:03:55.340 --> 2:03:56.700\n in this kind of media more and more\n\n2:03:56.700 --> 2:03:59.660\n by doing a podcast with her or just in any kind of way.\n\n2:03:59.660 --> 2:04:01.780\n So you're an awesome person.\n\n2:04:01.780 --> 2:04:03.380\n It's an honor to know you.\n\n2:04:03.380 --> 2:04:05.820\n It's an honor to get to sit down with you late at night,\n\n2:04:05.820 --> 2:04:08.360\n which is like surreal.\n\n2:04:08.360 --> 2:04:09.200\n And I really enjoyed it.\n\n2:04:09.200 --> 2:04:10.140\n Thank you for talking today.\n\n2:04:10.140 --> 2:04:11.700\n Yeah, no, I mean, huge honor.\n\n2:04:11.700 --> 2:04:13.640\n I feel very underqualified to be here, but I'm a big fan.\n\n2:04:13.640 --> 2:04:15.940\n I've been listening to the podcast a lot and yeah,\n\n2:04:15.940 --> 2:04:18.260\n me and Liv would appreciate any advice and help\n\n2:04:18.260 --> 2:04:19.220\n and we're definitely gonna do that.\n\n2:04:19.220 --> 2:04:21.380\n So yeah.\n\n2:04:21.380 --> 2:04:22.220\n Anytime.\n\n2:04:22.220 --> 2:04:23.040\n Thank you.\n\n2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:24.420\n Cool, thank you.\n\n2:04:24.420 --> 2:04:26.980\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Grimes.\n\n2:04:26.980 --> 2:04:28.220\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:04:28.220 --> 2:04:31.060\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:04:31.060 --> 2:04:34.660\n And now let me leave you with some words from Oscar Wilde.\n\n2:04:34.660 --> 2:04:36.940\n Yes, I'm a dreamer.\n\n2:04:36.940 --> 2:04:41.340\n For a dreamer is one who can only find her way by moonlight\n\n2:04:41.340 --> 2:04:44.260\n and her punishment is that she sees the dawn\n\n2:04:44.260 --> 2:04:45.740\n before the rest of the world.\n\n2:04:46.580 --> 2:04:49.020\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you\n\n2:04:49.020 --> 2:04:49.860\n next time.\n\n"
