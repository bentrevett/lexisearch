--> 00:10.320\n You can get the link to the first time in the description.\n\n00:10.320 --> 00:15.360\n This time we focus on quantum mechanics and the many worlds interpretation that he details\n\n00:15.360 --> 00:19.200\n elegantly in his new book titled Something Deeply Hidden.\n\n00:19.200 --> 00:24.520\n I own and enjoy both the eBook and audiobook versions of it.\n\n00:24.520 --> 00:29.400\n Listening to Sean read about entanglement, complementarity, and the emergence of space\n\n00:29.400 --> 00:35.600\n time reminds me of Bob Ross teaching the world how to paint on his old television show.\n\n00:35.600 --> 00:39.580\n If you don't know who Bob Ross is, you're truly missing out.\n\n00:39.580 --> 00:40.580\n Look him up.\n\n00:40.580 --> 00:42.960\n He'll make you fall in love with painting.\n\n00:42.960 --> 00:48.320\n Sean Carroll is the Bob Ross of theoretical physics.\n\n00:48.320 --> 00:53.520\n He's the author of several popular books, a host of a great podcast called Mindscape,\n\n00:53.520 --> 00:59.440\n and is a theoretical physicist at Caltech and the Santa Fe Institute, specializing in\n\n00:59.440 --> 01:04.280\n quantum mechanics, arrow of time, cosmology, and gravitation.\n\n01:04.280 --> 01:07.020\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:07.020 --> 01:12.720\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it five stars on iTunes, support it on Patreon,\n\n01:12.720 --> 01:18.560\n or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n01:18.560 --> 01:23.680\n And now here's my conversation with Sean Carroll.\n\n01:23.680 --> 01:28.400\n Isaac Newton developed what we now call classical mechanics that you describe very nicely in\n\n01:28.400 --> 01:32.500\n your new book, as you do with a lot of basic concepts in physics.\n\n01:32.500 --> 01:39.040\n So with classical mechanics, I can throw a rock and can predict the trajectory of that\n\n01:39.040 --> 01:41.080\n rock's flight.\n\n01:41.080 --> 01:47.340\n But if we could put ourselves back into Newton's time, his theories work to predict things,\n\n01:47.340 --> 01:52.480\n but as I understand, he himself thought that they were, their interpretations of those\n\n01:52.480 --> 01:56.120\n predictions were absurd.\n\n01:56.120 --> 02:01.560\n Perhaps he just said it for religious reasons and so on, but in particular, sort of a world\n\n02:01.560 --> 02:05.580\n of interaction without contact, so action at a distance.\n\n02:05.580 --> 02:09.860\n It didn't make sense to him on a sort of a human interpretation level.\n\n02:09.860 --> 02:16.480\n Does it make sense to you that things can affect other things at a distance?\n\n02:16.480 --> 02:20.140\n It does, but that was one of Newton's worries.\n\n02:20.140 --> 02:24.800\n You're actually right in a slightly different way about the religious worries.\n\n02:24.800 --> 02:29.680\n He was smart enough, this is off the topic but still fascinating, Newton almost invented\n\n02:29.680 --> 02:33.120\n chaos theory as soon as he invented classical mechanics.\n\n02:33.120 --> 02:37.600\n He realized that in the solar system, so he was able to explain how planets move around\n\n02:37.600 --> 02:43.100\n the Sun, but typically you would describe the orbit of the Earth ignoring the effects\n\n02:43.100 --> 02:46.400\n of Jupiter and Saturn and so forth, just doing the Earth and the Sun.\n\n02:46.400 --> 02:50.640\n He kind of knew, even though he couldn't do the math, that if you included the effects\n\n02:50.640 --> 02:54.560\n of Jupiter and Saturn and the other planets, the solar system would be unstable, like the\n\n02:54.560 --> 02:57.120\n orbits of the planets would get out of whack.\n\n02:57.120 --> 03:01.160\n So he thought that God would intervene occasionally to sort of move the planets back into orbit,\n\n03:01.160 --> 03:05.560\n which is the only way you could explain how they were there presumably forever.\n\n03:05.560 --> 03:08.540\n But the worries about classical mechanics were a little bit different, the worry about\n\n03:08.540 --> 03:09.540\n gravity in particular.\n\n03:09.540 --> 03:12.960\n It wasn't a worry about classical mechanics, it was a worry about gravity.\n\n03:12.960 --> 03:16.720\n How in the world does the Earth know that there's something called the Sun, 93 million\n\n03:16.720 --> 03:20.240\n miles away, that is exerting gravitational force on it?\n\n03:20.240 --> 03:24.760\n And he literally said, you know, I leave that for future generations to think about because\n\n03:24.760 --> 03:26.720\n I don't know what the answer is.\n\n03:26.720 --> 03:31.520\n And in fact, people under emphasized this, but future generations figured it out.\n\n03:31.520 --> 03:38.100\n Pierre Simone Laplace in circa 1800 showed that you could rewrite Newtonian gravity as\n\n03:38.100 --> 03:39.480\n a field theory.\n\n03:39.480 --> 03:43.640\n So instead of just talking about the force due to gravity, you can talk about the gravitational\n\n03:43.640 --> 03:48.280\n field or the gravitational potential field, and then there's no action at a distance.\n\n03:48.280 --> 03:52.260\n It's exactly the same theory empirically, it makes exactly the same predictions.\n\n03:52.260 --> 03:55.880\n But what's happening is instead of the Sun just reaching out across the void, there is\n\n03:55.880 --> 04:01.880\n a gravitational field in between the Sun and the Earth that obeys an equation, Laplace's\n\n04:01.880 --> 04:05.700\n equation, cleverly enough, and that tells us exactly what the field does.\n\n04:05.700 --> 04:09.900\n So even in Newtonian gravity, you don't need action at a distance.\n\n04:09.900 --> 04:13.880\n Now what many people say is that Einstein solved this problem because he invented general\n\n04:13.880 --> 04:14.880\n relativity.\n\n04:14.880 --> 04:19.380\n And in general relativity, there's certainly a field in between the Earth and the Sun.\n\n04:19.380 --> 04:21.720\n But also there's the speed of light as a limit.\n\n04:21.720 --> 04:26.720\n In Laplace's theory, which was exactly Newton's theory, just in a different mathematical language,\n\n04:26.720 --> 04:31.300\n there could still be instantaneous action across the universe, whereas in general relativity,\n\n04:31.300 --> 04:36.000\n if you shake something here, its gravitational impulse radiates out at the speed of light\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:39.340\n and we call that a gravitational wave and we can detect those.\n\n04:39.340 --> 04:45.280\n So but I really, it rubs me the wrong way to think that we should presume the answer\n\n04:45.280 --> 04:47.160\n should look one way or the other.\n\n04:47.160 --> 04:51.800\n Like if it turned out that there was action at a distance in physics and that was the\n\n04:51.800 --> 04:54.640\n best way to describe things, then I would do it that way.\n\n04:54.640 --> 04:58.920\n It's actually a very deep question because when we don't know what the right laws of\n\n04:58.920 --> 05:03.040\n physics are, when we're guessing at them, when we're hypothesizing at what they might\n\n05:03.040 --> 05:07.160\n be, we are often guided by our intuitions about what they should be.\n\n05:07.160 --> 05:11.840\n I mean, Einstein famously was very guided by his intuitions and he did not like the\n\n05:11.840 --> 05:15.760\n idea of action at a distance.\n\n05:15.760 --> 05:17.120\n We don't know whether he was right or not.\n\n05:17.120 --> 05:21.800\n It depends on your interpretation of quantum mechanics and it depends on even how you talk\n\n05:21.800 --> 05:24.040\n about quantum mechanics within any one interpretation.\n\n05:24.040 --> 05:32.200\n So if you see every force as a field or any other interpretation of action at a distance,\n\n05:32.200 --> 05:40.800\n just stepping back to sort of caveman thinking, like do you really, can you really sort of\n\n05:40.800 --> 05:45.520\n understand what it means for a force to be a field that's everywhere?\n\n05:45.520 --> 05:47.880\n So if you look at gravity, like what do you think about?\n\n05:47.880 --> 05:48.880\n I think so.\n\n05:48.880 --> 05:58.240\n Is this something that you've been conditioned by society to think that, to map the fact\n\n05:58.240 --> 06:04.380\n that science is extremely well predictive of something to believing that you actually\n\n06:04.380 --> 06:06.120\n understand it?\n\n06:06.120 --> 06:12.080\n Like you can intuitively, the degree that human beings can understand anything that\n\n06:12.080 --> 06:13.080\n you actually understand it.\n\n06:13.080 --> 06:19.240\n Or are you just trusting the beauty and the power of the predictive power of science?\n\n06:19.240 --> 06:25.000\n That depends on what you mean by this idea of truly understanding something, right?\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:29.360\n You know, I mean, can I truly understand Fermat's last theorem?\n\n06:29.360 --> 06:34.680\n You know, it's easy to state it, but do I really appreciate what it means for incredibly\n\n06:34.680 --> 06:37.440\n large numbers, right?\n\n06:37.440 --> 06:41.680\n I think yes, I think I do understand it, but like if you want to just push people on well,\n\n06:41.680 --> 06:46.440\n but your intuition doesn't go to the places where Andrew Wiles needed to go to prove Fermat's\n\n06:46.440 --> 06:50.120\n last theorem, then I can say fine, but I still think I understand the theorem.\n\n06:50.120 --> 06:56.200\n And likewise, I think that I do have a pretty good intuitive understanding of fields pervading\n\n06:56.200 --> 07:00.640\n space time, whether it's the gravitational field or the electromagnetic field or whatever,\n\n07:00.640 --> 07:03.000\n the Higgs field.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:08.080\n Of course, one's intuition gets worse and worse as you get trickier in the quantum field\n\n07:08.080 --> 07:12.960\n theory and all sorts of new phenomena that come up in quantum field theory.\n\n07:12.960 --> 07:17.080\n So our intuitions aren't perfect, but I think it's also okay to say that our intuitions\n\n07:17.080 --> 07:18.080\n get trained, right?\n\n07:18.080 --> 07:21.340\n Like, you know, I have different intuitions now than I had when I was a baby.\n\n07:21.340 --> 07:22.340\n That's okay.\n\n07:22.340 --> 07:26.000\n That's not, an intuition is not necessarily intrinsic to who we are.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:27.400\n We can train it a little bit.\n\n07:27.400 --> 07:33.080\n So that's where I'm going to bring in Noam Chomsky for a second, who thinks that our\n\n07:33.080 --> 07:40.320\n cognitive abilities are sort of evolved through time, and so they're biologically constrained.\n\n07:40.320 --> 07:45.520\n And so there's a clear limit, as he puts it, to our cognitive abilities, and it's a very\n\n07:45.520 --> 07:47.280\n harsh limit.\n\n07:47.280 --> 07:52.520\n But you actually kind of said something interesting in nature versus nurture thing here, is we\n\n07:52.520 --> 07:58.200\n can train our intuitions to sort of build up the cognitive muscles to be able to understand\n\n07:58.200 --> 07:59.400\n some of these tricky concepts.\n\n07:59.400 --> 08:07.320\n So do you think there's limits to our understanding that's deeply rooted, hardcoded into our biology\n\n08:07.320 --> 08:09.960\n that we can't overcome?\n\n08:09.960 --> 08:15.840\n There could be limits to things like our ability to visualize, okay?\n\n08:15.840 --> 08:20.200\n But when someone like Ed Witten proves a theorem about, you know, 100 dimensional mathematical\n\n08:20.200 --> 08:22.640\n spaces, he's not visualizing it.\n\n08:22.640 --> 08:23.640\n He's doing the math.\n\n08:23.640 --> 08:27.600\n That doesn't stop him from understanding the result.\n\n08:27.600 --> 08:32.480\n I think, and I would love to understand this better, but my rough feeling, which is not\n\n08:32.480 --> 08:37.800\n very educated, is that, you know, there's some threshold that one crosses in abstraction\n\n08:37.800 --> 08:41.520\n when one becomes kind of like a Turing machine, right?\n\n08:41.520 --> 08:48.440\n One has the ability to contain in one's brain logical, formal, symbolic structures and manipulate\n\n08:48.440 --> 08:49.440\n them.\n\n08:49.440 --> 08:55.240\n And that's a leap that we can make as human beings that dogs and cats haven't made.\n\n08:55.240 --> 09:00.440\n And once you get there, I'm not sure that there are any limits to our ability to understand\n\n09:00.440 --> 09:02.320\n the scientific world at all.\n\n09:02.320 --> 09:03.320\n Maybe there are.\n\n09:03.320 --> 09:07.080\n There's certainly limits in our ability to calculate things, right?\n\n09:07.080 --> 09:10.880\n You know, people are not very good at taking cube roots of million digit numbers in their\n\n09:10.880 --> 09:11.880\n head.\n\n09:11.880 --> 09:14.320\n But that's not an element of understanding.\n\n09:14.320 --> 09:15.880\n It's certainly not a limit in principle.\n\n09:15.880 --> 09:21.680\n So of course, as a human, you would say there doesn't feel to be limits to our understanding.\n\n09:21.680 --> 09:30.240\n But sort of, have you thought that the universe is actually a lot simpler than it appears\n\n09:30.240 --> 09:31.240\n to us?\n\n09:31.240 --> 09:36.200\n And we just will never be able to, like, it's outside of our, okay.\n\n09:36.200 --> 09:43.240\n So us, our cognitive abilities combined with our mathematical prowess and whatever kind\n\n09:43.240 --> 09:50.760\n of experimental simulation devices we can put together, is there limits to that?\n\n09:50.760 --> 09:52.960\n Is it possible there's limits to that?\n\n09:52.960 --> 09:57.260\n Well, of course it's possible that there are limits to that.\n\n09:57.260 --> 10:02.880\n Is there any good reason to think that we're anywhere close to the limits is a harder question.\n\n10:02.880 --> 10:07.240\n Look, imagine asking this question 500 years ago to the world's greatest thinkers, right?\n\n10:07.240 --> 10:12.320\n Like are we approaching the limits of our ability to understand the natural world?\n\n10:12.320 --> 10:17.180\n And by definition, there are questions about the natural world that are most interesting\n\n10:17.180 --> 10:19.840\n to us that are the ones we don't quite yet understand, right?\n\n10:19.840 --> 10:23.280\n So there's always, we're always faced with these puzzles we don't yet know.\n\n10:23.280 --> 10:26.140\n And I don't know what they would have said 500 years ago, but they didn't even know about\n\n10:26.140 --> 10:28.800\n classical mechanics, much less quantum mechanics.\n\n10:28.800 --> 10:33.560\n So we know that they were nowhere close to how well they could do, right?\n\n10:33.560 --> 10:36.160\n They could do enormously better than they were doing at the time.\n\n10:36.160 --> 10:39.240\n I see no reason why the same thing isn't true for us today.\n\n10:39.240 --> 10:44.560\n So of all the worries that keep me awake at night, the human mind's inability to rationally\n\n10:44.560 --> 10:47.560\n comprehend the world is low on the list.\n\n10:47.560 --> 10:49.880\n Well put.\n\n10:49.880 --> 10:54.320\n So one interesting philosophical point that quantum mechanics bring up is the, that you\n\n10:54.320 --> 11:02.040\n talk about the distinction between the world as it is and the world as we observe it.\n\n11:02.040 --> 11:08.200\n So staying at the human level for a second, how big is the gap between what our perception\n\n11:08.200 --> 11:15.720\n system allows us to see and the world as it is outside our mind's eye sort of, sort of\n\n11:15.720 --> 11:21.720\n not at the quantum mechanical level, but as just our, these particular tools we have,\n\n11:21.720 --> 11:26.320\n which is the few senses and cognitive abilities to process those senses.\n\n11:26.320 --> 11:31.400\n Well, that last phrase, having the cognitive abilities to process them carries a lot, right?\n\n11:31.400 --> 11:36.640\n I mean, there is our sort of intuitive understanding of the world.\n\n11:36.640 --> 11:41.040\n You don't need to teach people about gravity for them to know that apples fall from trees,\n\n11:41.040 --> 11:42.040\n right?\n\n11:42.040 --> 11:43.960\n That's something that we figure out pretty quickly.\n\n11:43.960 --> 11:47.480\n Project permanence, things like that, the three dimensionality of space, even if we\n\n11:47.480 --> 11:52.000\n don't have the mathematical language to say that, we kind of know that it's true.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:56.280\n On the other hand, no one opens their eyes and sees atoms, right?\n\n11:56.280 --> 12:00.240\n Or molecules or cells for that matter, forget about quantum mechanics.\n\n12:00.240 --> 12:07.520\n So but we got there, we got to understanding that there are atoms and cells using the combination\n\n12:07.520 --> 12:11.080\n of our senses and our cognitive capacities.\n\n12:11.080 --> 12:16.860\n So adding the ability of our cognitive capacities to our senses is adding an enormous amount\n\n12:16.860 --> 12:19.640\n and I don't think it is a hard and fast boundary.\n\n12:19.640 --> 12:23.480\n You know, if you believe in cells, if you believe that we understand those, then there's\n\n12:23.480 --> 12:29.840\n no reason you believe we can't believe in quantum mechanics just as well.\n\n12:29.840 --> 12:36.960\n What to you is the most beautiful idea in physics?\n\n12:36.960 --> 12:38.500\n Conservation of momentum.\n\n12:38.500 --> 12:39.760\n Can you elaborate?\n\n12:39.760 --> 12:40.760\n Yeah.\n\n12:40.760 --> 12:44.240\n So if you were Aristotle, when Aristotle wrote his book on physics, he made the following\n\n12:44.240 --> 12:45.240\n very obvious point.\n\n12:45.240 --> 12:46.240\n We're on video here, right?\n\n12:46.240 --> 12:47.240\n So people can see this.\n\n12:47.240 --> 12:48.240\n Yeah.\n\n12:48.240 --> 12:51.400\n So if I push the bottle, let me cover this bottle so we do not have a mess, but okay.\n\n12:51.400 --> 12:56.040\n So I push the bottle, it moves, and if I stop pushing, it stops moving.\n\n12:56.040 --> 13:00.940\n And this kind of thing is repeated a large number of times all over the place.\n\n13:00.940 --> 13:03.640\n If you don't keep pushing things, they stop moving.\n\n13:03.640 --> 13:09.040\n This is an indisputably true fact about our everyday environment, okay?\n\n13:09.040 --> 13:15.040\n And for Aristotle, this blew up into a whole picture of the world in which things had natures\n\n13:15.040 --> 13:19.600\n and teleologies, and they had places they wanted to be, and when you were pushing them,\n\n13:19.600 --> 13:23.040\n you were moving them away from where they wanted to be, and they would return and stuff\n\n13:23.040 --> 13:24.360\n like that.\n\n13:24.360 --> 13:31.880\n And it took a thousand years or 1500 years for people to say, actually, if it weren't\n\n13:31.880 --> 13:37.280\n for things like dissipation and air resistance and friction and so forth, the natural thing\n\n13:37.280 --> 13:42.960\n is for things to move forever in a straight line, there's a constant velocity, right?\n\n13:42.960 --> 13:44.680\n Conservation of momentum.\n\n13:44.680 --> 13:51.200\n And the reason why I think that's the most beautiful idea in physics is because it shifts\n\n13:51.200 --> 13:58.140\n us from a view of natures and teleology to a view of patterns in the world.\n\n13:58.140 --> 14:05.000\n So when you were Aristotle, you needed to talk a vocabulary of why is this happening,\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:08.380\n what's the purpose of it, what's the cause, etc., because, you know, it's nature does\n\n14:08.380 --> 14:12.280\n or does not want to do that, whereas once you believe in conservation of momentum, things\n\n14:12.280 --> 14:13.760\n just happen.\n\n14:13.760 --> 14:15.320\n They just follow the pattern.\n\n14:15.320 --> 14:17.920\n You give me, you have Laplace's demon, ultimately, right?\n\n14:17.920 --> 14:21.120\n You give me the state of the world today, I can predict what it's going to do in the\n\n14:21.120 --> 14:23.180\n future, I can predict where it was in the past.\n\n14:23.180 --> 14:26.880\n It's impersonal, and it's also instantaneous.\n\n14:26.880 --> 14:30.920\n It's not directed toward any future goals, it's just doing what it does given the current\n\n14:30.920 --> 14:32.320\n state of the universe.\n\n14:32.320 --> 14:37.080\n I think even more than either classical mechanics or quantum mechanics, that is the profound\n\n14:37.080 --> 14:40.660\n deep insight that gets modern science off the ground.\n\n14:40.660 --> 14:45.400\n You don't need natures and purposes and goals, you just need some patterns.\n\n14:45.400 --> 14:51.160\n So it's the first moment in our understanding of the way the universe works where you branch\n\n14:51.160 --> 14:57.820\n from the intuitive physical space to kind of the space of ideas.\n\n14:57.820 --> 15:03.380\n And also the other point you said, which is, conveniently, most of the interesting ideas\n\n15:03.380 --> 15:05.940\n are acting in the moment.\n\n15:05.940 --> 15:09.000\n You don't need to know the history of time or the future.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:12.000\n And of course, this took a long time to get there, right?\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:16.260\n I mean, the conservation of momentum itself took hundreds of years.\n\n15:16.260 --> 15:19.080\n It's weird, because like, someone would say something interesting, and then the next interesting\n\n15:19.080 --> 15:22.200\n thing would be said like 150 or 200 years later, right?\n\n15:22.200 --> 15:25.060\n They weren't even talking to each other, they were reading each other's books.\n\n15:25.060 --> 15:30.640\n And probably the first person to directly say that in outer space, in the vacuum, a\n\n15:30.640 --> 15:35.880\n projectile would move at a constant velocity was Avicenna, Ibn Sina in the Persian Golden\n\n15:35.880 --> 15:38.200\n Age, circa 1000.\n\n15:38.200 --> 15:39.700\n And he didn't like the idea.\n\n15:39.700 --> 15:44.600\n He used that, just like Schrodinger used Schrodinger's cat to say, surely you don't believe that,\n\n15:44.600 --> 15:45.600\n right?\n\n15:45.600 --> 15:48.760\n Ibn Sina was saying, surely you don't believe there really is a vacuum, because if there\n\n15:48.760 --> 15:52.300\n was a really vacuum, things could keep moving forever, right?\n\n15:52.300 --> 15:56.040\n But still, he got right the idea that there was this conservation of something impetus\n\n15:56.040 --> 15:58.300\n or mile, he would call it.\n\n15:58.300 --> 16:03.100\n And that's 500 years, 600 years before classical mechanics and Isaac Newton.\n\n16:03.100 --> 16:07.000\n So Galileo played a big role in this, but he didn't exactly get it right.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:12.280\n And so it just takes a long time for this to sink in, because it is so against our everyday\n\n16:12.280 --> 16:13.280\n experience.\n\n16:13.280 --> 16:21.580\n Do you think it was a big leap, a brave or a difficult leap of sort of math and science\n\n16:21.580 --> 16:25.280\n to be able to say that momentum is conserved?\n\n16:25.280 --> 16:26.280\n I do.\n\n16:26.280 --> 16:31.420\n You know, I think it's an example of human reason in action.\n\n16:31.420 --> 16:36.020\n You know, even Aristotle knew that his theory had issues, because you could fire an arrow\n\n16:36.020 --> 16:38.700\n and it would go a long way before it stopped.\n\n16:38.700 --> 16:42.720\n So if his theory was things just automatically stop, what's going on?\n\n16:42.720 --> 16:43.720\n And he had this elaborate story.\n\n16:43.720 --> 16:48.440\n I don't know if you've heard the story, but the arrow would push the air in front of it\n\n16:48.440 --> 16:53.300\n away and the molecules of air would run around to the back of the arrow and push it again.\n\n16:53.300 --> 16:56.860\n And anyone reading this is going like, really, that's what you thought?\n\n16:56.860 --> 17:00.660\n But it was that kind of thought experiment that ultimately got people to say like, actually,\n\n17:00.660 --> 17:04.460\n no, if it weren't for the air molecules at all, the arrow would just go on by itself.\n\n17:04.460 --> 17:09.980\n And it's always this give and take between thought and experience, back and forth, right?\n\n17:09.980 --> 17:13.740\n Theory and experiment, we would say today.\n\n17:13.740 --> 17:20.420\n Another big question that I think comes up, certainly with quantum mechanics, is what's\n\n17:20.420 --> 17:25.720\n the difference between math and physics to you?\n\n17:25.720 --> 17:30.280\n To me, you know, very, very roughly, math is about the logical structure of all possible\n\n17:30.280 --> 17:35.100\n worlds and physics is about our actual world.\n\n17:35.100 --> 17:40.820\n And it just feels like our actual world is a gray area when you start talking about interpretations\n\n17:40.820 --> 17:43.060\n of quantum mechanics, or no?\n\n17:43.060 --> 17:47.940\n I'm certainly using the word world in the broadest sense, all of reality.\n\n17:47.940 --> 17:50.740\n So I think that reality is specific.\n\n17:50.740 --> 17:54.420\n I don't think that there's every possible thing going on in reality.\n\n17:54.420 --> 17:58.520\n I think that there are rules, whether it's the Schrodinger equation or whatever.\n\n17:58.520 --> 18:03.180\n So I think that there's a sensible notion of the set of all possible worlds and we live\n\n18:03.180 --> 18:04.440\n in one of them.\n\n18:04.440 --> 18:07.980\n The world that we're talking about might be a multiverse, might be many worlds of quantum\n\n18:07.980 --> 18:10.940\n mechanics, might be much bigger than the world of our everyday experience, but it's still\n\n18:10.940 --> 18:15.940\n one physically contiguous world in some sense.\n\n18:15.940 --> 18:24.220\n But so if you look at the overlap of math and physics, it feels like when physics tries\n\n18:24.220 --> 18:30.620\n to reach for understanding of our world, it uses the tools of math to sort of reach beyond\n\n18:30.620 --> 18:34.320\n the limit of our current understanding.\n\n18:34.320 --> 18:41.380\n What do you make of that process of sort of using math to, so you start maybe with intuition\n\n18:41.380 --> 18:45.500\n or you might start with the math and then build up an intuition or, but this kind of\n\n18:45.500 --> 18:49.540\n reaching into the darkness, into the mystery of the world with math.\n\n18:49.540 --> 18:51.700\n Well, I think I would put it a little bit differently.\n\n18:51.700 --> 18:57.900\n I think we have theories, theories of the physical world, which we then extrapolate\n\n18:57.900 --> 19:02.380\n and ask, you know, what do we conclude if we take these seriously well beyond where\n\n19:02.380 --> 19:03.700\n we've actually tested them?\n\n19:03.700 --> 19:09.180\n It is separately true that math is really, really useful when we construct physical theories\n\n19:09.180 --> 19:13.060\n and you know, famously Eugene Wigner asked about the unreasonable success of mathematics\n\n19:13.060 --> 19:14.060\n and physics.\n\n19:14.060 --> 19:20.140\n I think that's a little bit wrong because anything that could happen, any other theory\n\n19:20.140 --> 19:24.700\n of physics that wasn't the real world, but some other world, you could always describe\n\n19:24.700 --> 19:25.700\n it mathematically.\n\n19:25.700 --> 19:28.180\n It's just that it might be a mess.\n\n19:28.180 --> 19:33.660\n The surprising thing is not that math works, but that the math is so simple and easy that\n\n19:33.660 --> 19:35.660\n you can write it down on a t shirt, right?\n\n19:35.660 --> 19:37.640\n I mean, that's what is amazing.\n\n19:37.640 --> 19:44.020\n That's an enormous compression of information that seems to be valid in the real world.\n\n19:44.020 --> 19:48.340\n So that's an interesting fact about our world, which maybe we could hope to explain or just\n\n19:48.340 --> 19:49.620\n take as a brute fact.\n\n19:49.620 --> 19:50.880\n I don't know.\n\n19:50.880 --> 19:56.100\n But once you have that, you know, there's this indelible relationship between math and\n\n19:56.100 --> 19:59.380\n physics, but philosophically I do want to separate them.\n\n19:59.380 --> 20:03.740\n What we extrapolate, we don't extrapolate math because there's a whole bunch of wrong\n\n20:03.740 --> 20:06.060\n math, you know, that doesn't apply to our world, right?\n\n20:06.060 --> 20:09.980\n We extrapolate the physical theory that we best think explains our world.\n\n20:09.980 --> 20:12.700\n Again, an unanswerable question.\n\n20:12.700 --> 20:19.780\n Why do you think our world is so easily compressible into beautiful equations?\n\n20:19.780 --> 20:20.780\n Yeah.\n\n20:20.780 --> 20:23.940\n I mean, like I just hinted at, I don't know if there's an answer to that question.\n\n20:23.940 --> 20:24.940\n There could be.\n\n20:24.940 --> 20:26.460\n What would an answer look like?\n\n20:26.460 --> 20:31.380\n Well, an answer could look like if you showed that there was something about our world that\n\n20:31.380 --> 20:33.260\n maximizes something.\n\n20:33.260 --> 20:40.100\n You know, the mean of the simplicity and the powerfulness of the laws of physics or, you\n\n20:40.100 --> 20:41.920\n know, maybe we're just generic.\n\n20:41.920 --> 20:44.980\n Maybe in the set of all possible worlds, this is what the world would look like, right?\n\n20:44.980 --> 20:46.500\n Like I don't really know.\n\n20:46.500 --> 20:48.340\n I tend to think not.\n\n20:48.340 --> 20:54.220\n I tend to think that there is something specific and rock bottom about the facts of our world\n\n20:54.220 --> 20:56.060\n that don't have further explanation.\n\n20:56.060 --> 20:58.260\n Like the fact of the world exists at all.\n\n20:58.260 --> 21:00.780\n And furthermore, the specific laws of physics that we have.\n\n21:00.780 --> 21:04.660\n I think that in some sense, we're just going to, at some level, we're going to say, and\n\n21:04.660 --> 21:05.660\n that's how it is.\n\n21:05.660 --> 21:07.340\n And, you know, we can't explain anything more.\n\n21:07.340 --> 21:11.580\n I don't know how, if we're anywhere close to that right now, but that seems plausible\n\n21:11.580 --> 21:12.580\n to me.\n\n21:12.580 --> 21:16.780\n And speaking of rock bottom, one of the things sort of your book kind of reminded me or revealed\n\n21:16.780 --> 21:23.340\n to me is that what's fundamental and what's emergent, it just feels like I don't even\n\n21:23.340 --> 21:28.420\n know anymore what's fundamental in physics, if there's anything.\n\n21:28.420 --> 21:33.980\n It feels like everything, especially with quantum mechanics, is revealing to us is that\n\n21:33.980 --> 21:41.460\n most interesting things that I would, as a limited human would think are fundamental\n\n21:41.460 --> 21:48.980\n can actually be explained as emergent from the more deeper laws.\n\n21:48.980 --> 21:51.140\n I mean, we don't know, of course.\n\n21:51.140 --> 21:52.480\n You had to get that on the table.\n\n21:52.480 --> 21:54.620\n We don't know what is fundamental.\n\n21:54.620 --> 22:00.480\n We do have reasons to say that certain things are more fundamental than others, right?\n\n22:00.480 --> 22:03.980\n Atoms and molecules are more fundamental than cells and organs.\n\n22:03.980 --> 22:07.600\n Quantum fields are more fundamental than atoms and molecules.\n\n22:07.600 --> 22:09.780\n We don't know if that ever bottoms out.\n\n22:09.780 --> 22:13.860\n I do think that there's sensible ways to think about this.\n\n22:13.860 --> 22:18.140\n If you describe something like this table as a table, it has a height and a width and\n\n22:18.140 --> 22:22.580\n it's made of a certain material and it has a certain solidity and weight and so forth.\n\n22:22.580 --> 22:24.940\n That's a very useful description as far as it goes.\n\n22:24.940 --> 22:29.380\n There's a whole other description of this table in terms of a whole collection of atoms\n\n22:29.380 --> 22:31.640\n strung together in certain ways.\n\n22:31.640 --> 22:36.340\n The language of the atoms is more comprehensive than the language of the table.\n\n22:36.340 --> 22:41.100\n You could break apart the table, smash it to pieces, still talk about it as atoms, but\n\n22:41.100 --> 22:43.940\n you could no longer talk about it as a table, right?\n\n22:43.940 --> 22:48.380\n So I think that this comprehensiveness, the domain of validity of a theory gets broader\n\n22:48.380 --> 22:52.900\n and broader as the theory gets more and more fundamental.\n\n22:52.900 --> 22:57.620\n So what do you think Newton would say?\n\n22:57.620 --> 23:02.140\n Maybe right in the book review, if you read your latest book on quantum mechanics, something\n\n23:02.140 --> 23:03.140\n deeply hidden.\n\n23:03.140 --> 23:08.140\n It would take a long time for him to think that any of this was making any sense.\n\n23:08.140 --> 23:10.260\n You catch him up pretty quick in the beginning.\n\n23:10.260 --> 23:11.260\n Yeah.\n\n23:11.260 --> 23:13.220\n You give him a shout out in the beginning.\n\n23:13.220 --> 23:14.220\n That's right.\n\n23:14.220 --> 23:15.220\n He is the man.\n\n23:15.220 --> 23:19.460\n I'm happy to say that Newton was the greatest scientist who ever lived.\n\n23:19.460 --> 23:22.500\n He invented calculus in his spare time, which would have made him the greatest mathematician\n\n23:22.500 --> 23:25.620\n just all by himself, all by that one thing.\n\n23:25.620 --> 23:33.540\n But of course, it's funny because Newton was in some sense still a pre modern thinker.\n\n23:33.540 --> 23:39.480\n Rocky Kolb, who is a cosmologist at the University of Chicago said that Galileo, even though\n\n23:39.480 --> 23:43.740\n he came before Newton, was a more modern thinker than Newton was.\n\n23:43.740 --> 23:46.660\n If you got Galileo and brought him to the present day, it would take him six months\n\n23:46.660 --> 23:49.580\n to catch up and then he'd be in your office telling you why your most recent paper was\n\n23:49.580 --> 23:50.740\n wrong.\n\n23:50.740 --> 23:55.440\n Whereas Newton just thought in this kind of more mystical way.\n\n23:55.440 --> 24:01.920\n He wrote a lot more about the Bible and alchemy than he ever did about physics, but he was\n\n24:01.920 --> 24:06.260\n also more brilliant than anybody else and way more mathematically astute than Galileo.\n\n24:06.260 --> 24:08.420\n So I really don't know.\n\n24:08.420 --> 24:12.060\n He might have, he might just, yeah, say like, give me the textbooks, leave me alone for\n\n24:12.060 --> 24:15.200\n a few months and then be caught up.\n\n24:15.200 --> 24:19.900\n But he might have had mental blocks against seeing the world in this way.\n\n24:19.900 --> 24:20.900\n I really don't know.\n\n24:20.900 --> 24:24.780\n Or perhaps find an interesting mystical interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n\n24:24.780 --> 24:25.780\n Very possible.\n\n24:25.780 --> 24:26.780\n Yeah.\n\n24:26.780 --> 24:31.500\n Is there any other scientists or philosophers through history that you would like to know\n\n24:31.500 --> 24:33.580\n their opinion of your book?\n\n24:33.580 --> 24:36.420\n That's a, that's a good question.\n\n24:36.420 --> 24:38.500\n I mean, Einstein is the obvious one, right?\n\n24:38.500 --> 24:42.100\n We all, I mean, he was not that long ago, but I even speculated at the end of my book\n\n24:42.100 --> 24:44.140\n about what his opinion would be.\n\n24:44.140 --> 24:50.140\n I am curious as to, you know, what about older philosophers like Hume or Kant, right?\n\n24:50.140 --> 24:51.140\n Like what would they have thought?\n\n24:51.140 --> 24:55.840\n Or Aristotle, you know, what would they have thought about modern physics?\n\n24:55.840 --> 25:01.980\n Because they do in philosophy, your predilections end up playing a much bigger role in your\n\n25:01.980 --> 25:07.180\n ultimate conclusions because you're not as tied down by what the data is in physics.\n\n25:07.180 --> 25:11.060\n You know, physics is lucky because we can't stray too far off the reservation as long\n\n25:11.060 --> 25:15.820\n as we're trying to explain the world that we actually see in our telescopes and microscopes.\n\n25:15.820 --> 25:20.900\n But it's just not fair to play that game because the people we're thinking about didn't know\n\n25:20.900 --> 25:23.580\n a whole bunch of things that we know, right?\n\n25:23.580 --> 25:26.380\n Like we lived through a lot that they didn't live through.\n\n25:26.380 --> 25:32.700\n So by the time we got them caught up, they'd be different people.\n\n25:32.700 --> 25:35.940\n So let me ask a bunch of basic questions.\n\n25:35.940 --> 25:40.220\n I think it would be interesting, useful for people who are not familiar, but even for\n\n25:40.220 --> 25:42.940\n people who are extremely well familiar.\n\n25:42.940 --> 25:47.260\n Let's start with what is quantum mechanics?\n\n25:47.260 --> 25:51.820\n Quantum mechanics is the paradigm of physics that came into being in the early part of\n\n25:51.820 --> 25:58.380\n the 20th century that replaced classical mechanics, and it replaced classical mechanics in a weird\n\n25:58.380 --> 26:00.380\n way that we're still coming to terms with.\n\n26:00.380 --> 26:05.580\n So in classical mechanics, you have an object, it has a location, it has a velocity, and\n\n26:05.580 --> 26:08.660\n if you know the location and velocity of everything in the world, you can say what everything's\n\n26:08.660 --> 26:10.420\n going to do.\n\n26:10.420 --> 26:15.660\n Quantum mechanics has an aspect of it that is kind of on the same lines.\n\n26:15.660 --> 26:19.340\n There's something called the quantum state or the wave function.\n\n26:19.340 --> 26:22.260\n And there's an equation governing what the quantum state does.\n\n26:22.260 --> 26:23.980\n So it's very much like classical mechanics.\n\n26:23.980 --> 26:25.660\n The wave function is different.\n\n26:25.660 --> 26:26.980\n It's sort of a wave.\n\n26:26.980 --> 26:31.380\n It's a vector in a huge dimensional vector space rather than a position and a velocity,\n\n26:31.380 --> 26:33.060\n but okay, that's a detail.\n\n26:33.060 --> 26:37.700\n The equation is the Schrodinger equation, not Newton's laws, but okay, again, a detail.\n\n26:37.700 --> 26:41.380\n Where quantum mechanics really becomes weird and different is that there's a whole other\n\n26:41.380 --> 26:46.820\n set of rules in our textbook formulation of quantum mechanics in addition to saying that\n\n26:46.820 --> 26:49.320\n there's a quantum state and it evolves in time.\n\n26:49.320 --> 26:52.820\n And all these new rules have to do with what happens when you look at the system, when\n\n26:52.820 --> 26:55.100\n you observe it, when you measure it.\n\n26:55.100 --> 26:58.420\n In classical mechanics, there were no rules about observing.\n\n26:58.420 --> 27:00.260\n You just look at it and you see what's going on.\n\n27:00.260 --> 27:01.580\n That was it, right?\n\n27:01.580 --> 27:06.940\n In quantum mechanics, the way we teach it, there's something profoundly fundamental about\n\n27:06.940 --> 27:12.260\n the act of measurement or observation, and the system dramatically changes its state.\n\n27:12.260 --> 27:16.780\n Even though it has a wave function, like the electron in an atom is not orbiting in a circle,\n\n27:16.780 --> 27:21.460\n it's sort of spread out in a cloud, when you look at it, you don't see that cloud.\n\n27:21.460 --> 27:24.840\n When you look at it, it looks like a particle with a location.\n\n27:24.840 --> 27:29.380\n So it dramatically changes its state right away, and the effects of that change can be\n\n27:29.380 --> 27:32.120\n instantly seen in what the electron does next.\n\n27:32.120 --> 27:39.060\n So again, we need to be careful because we don't agree on what quantum mechanics says.\n\n27:39.060 --> 27:41.660\n That's why I need to say like in the textbook view, et cetera, right?\n\n27:41.660 --> 27:48.540\n But in the textbook view, quantum mechanics, unlike any other theory of physics, gives\n\n27:48.540 --> 27:51.060\n a fundamental role to the act of measurement.\n\n27:51.060 --> 27:56.980\n So maybe even more basic, what is an atom and what is an electron?\n\n27:56.980 --> 27:57.980\n Sure.\n\n27:57.980 --> 28:01.780\n This all came together in a few years around the turn of the last century, right?\n\n28:01.780 --> 28:05.180\n Around the year 1900.\n\n28:05.180 --> 28:09.220\n Atoms predated then, of course, the word atom goes back to the ancient Greeks, but it was\n\n28:09.220 --> 28:15.300\n the chemists in the 1800s that really first got experimental evidence for atoms.\n\n28:15.300 --> 28:21.020\n They realized that there were two different types of tin oxide.\n\n28:21.020 --> 28:25.300\n And in these two different types of tin oxide, there was exactly twice as much oxygen in\n\n28:25.300 --> 28:27.180\n one type as the other.\n\n28:27.180 --> 28:28.940\n And like, why is that?\n\n28:28.940 --> 28:31.700\n Why is it never 1.5 times as much, right?\n\n28:31.700 --> 28:38.280\n And so Dalton said, well, it's because there are tin atoms and oxygen atoms, and one form\n\n28:38.280 --> 28:42.940\n of tin oxide is one atom of tin and one atom of oxygen, and the other is one atom of tin\n\n28:42.940 --> 28:44.820\n and two atoms of oxygen.\n\n28:44.820 --> 28:49.220\n And on the basis of this, you know, a speculation, a theory, right, a hypothesis, but then on\n\n28:49.220 --> 28:52.900\n the basis of that, you make other predictions, and the chemists became quickly convinced\n\n28:52.900 --> 28:54.540\n that atoms were real.\n\n28:54.540 --> 28:58.880\n The physicists took a lot longer to catch on, but eventually they did.\n\n28:58.880 --> 29:04.380\n And I mean, Boltzmann, who believed in atoms, had a really tough time his whole life because\n\n29:04.380 --> 29:07.220\n he worked in Germany where atoms were not popular.\n\n29:07.220 --> 29:09.800\n They were popular in England, but not in Germany.\n\n29:09.800 --> 29:15.160\n And there, in general, the idea of atoms is, it's the most, the smallest building block\n\n29:15.160 --> 29:17.080\n of the universe for them.\n\n29:17.080 --> 29:18.080\n That's the kind of how they thought it was.\n\n29:18.080 --> 29:22.760\n That was the Greek idea, but the chemists in the 1800s jumped the gun a little bit.\n\n29:22.760 --> 29:27.860\n So these days, an atom is the smallest building block of a chemical element, right?\n\n29:27.860 --> 29:33.180\n Hydrogen, tin, oxygen, carbon, whatever, but we know that atoms can be broken up further\n\n29:33.180 --> 29:34.180\n than that.\n\n29:34.180 --> 29:40.620\n That's what physicists discovered in the early 1900s, Rutherford, especially, and his colleagues.\n\n29:40.620 --> 29:46.740\n So the atom that we think about now, the cartoon, is that picture you've always seen of a little\n\n29:46.740 --> 29:50.260\n nucleus and then electrons orbiting it like a little solar system.\n\n29:50.260 --> 29:53.180\n And we now know the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons.\n\n29:53.180 --> 29:58.640\n So the weight of the atom, the mass, is almost all in its nucleus.\n\n29:58.640 --> 30:03.880\n Protons and neutrons are something like 1800 times as heavy as electrons are.\n\n30:03.880 --> 30:09.020\n Protons are much lighter, but because they're lighter, they give all the life to the atoms.\n\n30:09.020 --> 30:13.740\n So when atoms get together, combine chemically, when electricity flows through a system, it's\n\n30:13.740 --> 30:16.900\n all the electrons that are doing all the work.\n\n30:16.900 --> 30:21.300\n And where quantum mechanics steps in, as you mentioned, with the position of velocity with\n\n30:21.300 --> 30:26.900\n classical mechanics and quantum mechanics is modeling the behavior of the electron.\n\n30:26.900 --> 30:30.620\n I mean, you can model the behavior of anything, but the electron, because that's where the\n\n30:30.620 --> 30:31.900\n fun is.\n\n30:31.900 --> 30:34.580\n The electron was the biggest challenge right from the start.\n\n30:34.580 --> 30:35.580\n Yeah.\n\n30:35.580 --> 30:36.580\n So what's a wave function?\n\n30:36.580 --> 30:43.540\n You said it's an interesting detail, but in any interpretation, what is the wave function\n\n30:43.540 --> 30:44.540\n in quantum mechanics?\n\n30:44.540 --> 30:50.260\n Well, you know, we had this idea from Rutherford that atoms look like little solar systems,\n\n30:50.260 --> 30:54.760\n but people very quickly realize that can't possibly be right because if an electron is\n\n30:54.760 --> 30:57.640\n orbiting in a circle, it will give off light.\n\n30:57.640 --> 31:01.540\n All the light that we have in this room comes from electrons zooming up and down and wiggling.\n\n31:01.540 --> 31:03.260\n That's what electromagnetic waves are.\n\n31:03.260 --> 31:07.660\n And you can calculate how long would it take for the electron just to spiral into the nucleus?\n\n31:07.660 --> 31:12.180\n And the answer is 10 to the minus 11 seconds, okay, 100 billionth of a second.\n\n31:12.180 --> 31:14.380\n So that's not right.\n\n31:14.380 --> 31:21.300\n Meanwhile, people had realized that light, which we understood from the 1800s was a wave,\n\n31:21.300 --> 31:23.940\n had properties that were similar to that of particles, right?\n\n31:23.940 --> 31:26.740\n This is Einstein and Planck and stuff like that.\n\n31:26.740 --> 31:34.020\n So if something that we agree was a wave had particle like properties, then maybe something\n\n31:34.020 --> 31:38.540\n we think is a particle, the electron has wave like properties, right?\n\n31:38.540 --> 31:42.900\n And so a bunch of people eventually came to the conclusion, don't think about the electron\n\n31:42.900 --> 31:47.180\n as a little point particle orbiting like a solar system.\n\n31:47.180 --> 31:49.780\n Think of it as a wave that is spread out.\n\n31:49.780 --> 31:53.100\n They cleverly gave this the name the wave function, which is the dopiest name in the\n\n31:53.100 --> 31:57.420\n world for one of the most profound things in the universe.\n\n31:57.420 --> 32:03.100\n There's literally a number at every point in space, which is the value of the electron's\n\n32:03.100 --> 32:04.980\n wave function at that point.\n\n32:04.980 --> 32:07.580\n And there's only one wave function.\n\n32:07.580 --> 32:09.600\n Yeah, they eventually figured that out.\n\n32:09.600 --> 32:10.960\n That took longer.\n\n32:10.960 --> 32:15.220\n But when you have two electrons, you do not have a wave function for electron one and\n\n32:15.220 --> 32:17.140\n a wave function for electron two.\n\n32:17.140 --> 32:20.420\n You have one combined wave function for both of them.\n\n32:20.420 --> 32:26.980\n And indeed, as you say, there's only one wave function for the entire universe at once.\n\n32:26.980 --> 32:32.620\n And that's where this beautiful dance, can you say what is entanglement?\n\n32:32.620 --> 32:35.580\n It seems one of the most fundamental ideas of quantum mechanics.\n\n32:35.580 --> 32:39.580\n Well, let's temporarily buy into the textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n\n32:39.580 --> 32:43.820\n And what that says is that this wave function, so it's very small outside the atom, very\n\n32:43.820 --> 32:48.940\n big in the atom, basically the wave function, you take it and you square it, you square\n\n32:48.940 --> 32:54.220\n the number that gives you the probability of observing the system at that location.\n\n32:54.220 --> 32:58.700\n So if you say that for two electrons, there's only one wave function, and that wave function\n\n32:58.700 --> 33:03.060\n gives you the probability of observing both electrons at once doing something, okay?\n\n33:03.060 --> 33:07.220\n So maybe the electron can be here or here, here, here, and the other electron can also\n\n33:07.220 --> 33:08.300\n be there.\n\n33:08.300 --> 33:12.600\n But we have a wave function set up where we don't know where either electron is going\n\n33:12.600 --> 33:14.100\n to be seen.\n\n33:14.100 --> 33:17.800\n But we know they'll both be seen in the same place, okay?\n\n33:17.800 --> 33:22.100\n So we don't know exactly what we're going to see for either electron, but there's entanglement\n\n33:22.100 --> 33:23.740\n between the two of them.\n\n33:23.740 --> 33:25.460\n There's a sort of conditional statement.\n\n33:25.460 --> 33:29.440\n If we see one in one location, then we know the other one's going to be doing a certain\n\n33:29.440 --> 33:30.440\n thing.\n\n33:30.440 --> 33:34.220\n So that's a feature of quantum mechanics that is nowhere to be found in classical mechanics.\n\n33:34.220 --> 33:37.660\n In classical mechanics, there's no way I can say, well, I don't know where either one of\n\n33:37.660 --> 33:40.700\n these particles is, but if I know, if I find out where this one is, then I know where the\n\n33:40.700 --> 33:41.700\n other one is.\n\n33:41.700 --> 33:42.700\n That just never happens.\n\n33:42.700 --> 33:43.700\n They're truly separate.\n\n33:43.700 --> 33:47.980\n I don't know, it feels like, if you think of a wave function like as a dance floor,\n\n33:47.980 --> 33:53.860\n it seems like entanglement is strongest between things that are dancing together closest.\n\n33:53.860 --> 33:56.420\n So there's a closeness that's important.\n\n33:56.420 --> 33:58.340\n Well, that's another step.\n\n33:58.340 --> 34:02.660\n We have to be careful here because in principle, if you're talking about the entanglement of\n\n34:02.660 --> 34:08.860\n two electrons, for example, they can be totally entangled or totally unentangled no matter\n\n34:08.860 --> 34:10.180\n where they are in the universe.\n\n34:10.180 --> 34:15.180\n There's no relationship between the amount of entanglement and the distance between two\n\n34:15.180 --> 34:16.180\n electrons.\n\n34:16.180 --> 34:21.120\n But we now know that the reality of our best way of understanding the world is through\n\n34:21.120 --> 34:23.860\n quantum fields, not through particles.\n\n34:23.860 --> 34:28.540\n So even the electron, not just gravity and electromagnetism, but even the electron and\n\n34:28.540 --> 34:33.160\n the quarks and so forth are really vibrations in quantum fields.\n\n34:33.160 --> 34:38.340\n So even empty space is full of vibrating quantum fields.\n\n34:38.340 --> 34:42.840\n And those quantum fields in empty space are entangled with each other in exactly the way\n\n34:42.840 --> 34:43.840\n you just said.\n\n34:43.840 --> 34:47.020\n If they're nearby, if you have like two vibrating quantum fields that are nearby, then they'll\n\n34:47.020 --> 34:48.580\n be highly entangled.\n\n34:48.580 --> 34:50.540\n If they're far away, they will not be entangled.\n\n34:50.540 --> 34:52.880\n So what do quantum fields in a vacuum look like?\n\n34:52.880 --> 34:53.880\n Empty space?\n\n34:53.880 --> 34:54.880\n Just like empty space.\n\n34:54.880 --> 34:56.600\n It's as empty as it can be.\n\n34:56.600 --> 34:57.980\n But there's still a field.\n\n34:57.980 --> 35:02.420\n It's just, what does nothing look like?\n\n35:02.420 --> 35:06.340\n Just like right here, this location in space, there's a gravitational field, which I can\n\n35:06.340 --> 35:07.980\n detect by dropping something.\n\n35:07.980 --> 35:08.980\n Yes.\n\n35:08.980 --> 35:12.860\n I don't see it, but there it is.\n\n35:12.860 --> 35:17.860\n So we got a little bit of an idea of entanglement.\n\n35:17.860 --> 35:23.980\n Now, what is Hilbert space and Euclidean space?\n\n35:23.980 --> 35:28.180\n Yeah, you know, I think that people are very welcome to go through their lives not knowing\n\n35:28.180 --> 35:29.360\n what Hilbert space is.\n\n35:29.360 --> 35:33.580\n But if you dig into a little bit more into quantum mechanics, it becomes necessary.\n\n35:33.580 --> 35:39.420\n You know, the English language was invented long before quantum mechanics, or various\n\n35:39.420 --> 35:41.260\n forms of higher mathematics were invented.\n\n35:41.260 --> 35:45.020\n So we use the word space to mean different things.\n\n35:45.020 --> 35:48.700\n Of course, most of us think of space as this three dimensional world in which we live,\n\n35:48.700 --> 35:49.700\n right?\n\n35:49.700 --> 35:51.420\n I mean, some of us just think of it as outer space.\n\n35:51.420 --> 35:56.420\n Okay, but space around us gives us the three dimensional location of things and objects.\n\n35:56.420 --> 36:05.820\n But mathematicians use any generic abstract collection of elements as a space, okay?\n\n36:05.820 --> 36:09.940\n A space of possibilities, you know, momentum space, etc.\n\n36:09.940 --> 36:14.480\n So Hilbert space is the space of all possible quantum wave functions, either for the universe\n\n36:14.480 --> 36:16.740\n or for some specific system.\n\n36:16.740 --> 36:21.300\n And it could be an infinite dimensional space, or it could be just really, really large dimensional\n\n36:21.300 --> 36:22.300\n but finite.\n\n36:22.300 --> 36:24.960\n We don't know because we don't know the final theory of everything.\n\n36:24.960 --> 36:29.540\n But this abstract Hilbert space is really, really, really big and has no immediate connection\n\n36:29.540 --> 36:31.780\n to the three dimensional space in which we live.\n\n36:31.780 --> 36:35.220\n What do dimensions in Hilbert space mean?\n\n36:35.220 --> 36:40.020\n You know, it's just a way of mathematically representing how much information is contained\n\n36:40.020 --> 36:41.660\n in the state of the system.\n\n36:41.660 --> 36:45.720\n How many numbers do you have to give me to specify what the thing is doing?\n\n36:45.720 --> 36:51.020\n So in classical mechanics, I give you the location of something by giving you three\n\n36:51.020 --> 36:52.020\n numbers, right?\n\n36:52.020 --> 36:54.340\n Up, down, left, X, Y, Z coordinates.\n\n36:54.340 --> 37:00.100\n But then I might want to give you its entire state, physical state, which means both its\n\n37:00.100 --> 37:02.680\n position and also its velocity.\n\n37:02.680 --> 37:04.520\n The velocity also has three components.\n\n37:04.520 --> 37:09.860\n So its state lives in something called phase space, which is six dimensional, three dimensions\n\n37:09.860 --> 37:12.540\n of position, three dimensions of velocity.\n\n37:12.540 --> 37:16.200\n And then if it also has an orientation in space, that's another three dimensions and\n\n37:16.200 --> 37:17.200\n so forth.\n\n37:17.200 --> 37:22.620\n So as you describe more and more information about the system, you have an abstract mathematical\n\n37:22.620 --> 37:26.460\n space that has more and more numbers that you need to give.\n\n37:26.460 --> 37:29.840\n And each one of those numbers corresponds to a dimension in that space.\n\n37:29.840 --> 37:34.760\n So in terms of the amount of information, what is entropy?\n\n37:34.760 --> 37:40.740\n This mystical word that's overused in math and physics, but has a very specific meaning\n\n37:40.740 --> 37:41.940\n in this context.\n\n37:41.940 --> 37:44.300\n Sadly, it has more than one very specific meeting.\n\n37:44.300 --> 37:46.660\n This is the reason why it is hard.\n\n37:46.660 --> 37:49.200\n Entropy means different things even to different physicists.\n\n37:49.200 --> 37:54.120\n But one way of thinking about it is a measure of how much we don't know about the state\n\n37:54.120 --> 37:55.160\n of a system.\n\n37:55.160 --> 38:00.540\n So if I have a bottle of water molecules, and I know that, OK, there's a certain number\n\n38:00.540 --> 38:01.540\n of water molecules.\n\n38:01.540 --> 38:02.940\n I could weigh it and figure out.\n\n38:02.940 --> 38:06.740\n I know the volume of it, and I know the temperature and pressure and things like that.\n\n38:06.740 --> 38:12.280\n I certainly don't know the exact position and velocity of every water molecule.\n\n38:12.280 --> 38:15.600\n So there's a certain amount of information I know, a certain amount that I don't know\n\n38:15.600 --> 38:18.540\n that is part of the complete state of the system.\n\n38:18.540 --> 38:23.340\n And that's what the entropy characterizes, how much unknown information there is, the\n\n38:23.340 --> 38:28.300\n difference between what I do know about the system and its full exact microscopic state.\n\n38:28.300 --> 38:36.660\n So when we try to describe a quantum mechanical system, is it infinite or finite but very\n\n38:36.660 --> 38:37.660\n large?\n\n38:37.660 --> 38:38.660\n Yeah, we don't know.\n\n38:38.660 --> 38:39.660\n That depends on the system.\n\n38:39.660 --> 38:44.300\n You know, it's easy to mathematically write down a system that would have a potentially\n\n38:44.300 --> 38:47.480\n infinite entropy, an infinite dimensional Hilbert space.\n\n38:47.480 --> 38:50.100\n So let's go back a little bit.\n\n38:50.100 --> 38:54.340\n We said that the Hilbert space was the space in which quantum wave functions lived for\n\n38:54.340 --> 38:57.220\n different systems that will be different sizes.\n\n38:57.220 --> 38:58.420\n They could be infinite or finite.\n\n38:58.420 --> 39:03.380\n So that's the number of numbers, the number of pieces of information you could potentially\n\n39:03.380 --> 39:04.620\n give me about the system.\n\n39:04.620 --> 39:11.100\n So the bigger Hilbert space is, the bigger the entropy of that system could be, depending\n\n39:11.100 --> 39:12.100\n on what I know about it.\n\n39:12.100 --> 39:16.260\n If I don't know anything about it, then it has a huge entropy, right, but only up to\n\n39:16.260 --> 39:18.160\n the size of its Hilbert space.\n\n39:18.160 --> 39:23.860\n So we don't know in the real physical world whether or not, you know, this region of space\n\n39:23.860 --> 39:29.140\n that contains that water bottle has potentially an infinite entropy or just a finite entropy.\n\n39:29.140 --> 39:31.580\n We have different arguments on different sides.\n\n39:31.580 --> 39:35.640\n So if it's infinite, how do you think about infinity?\n\n39:35.640 --> 39:42.020\n Is this something you can, your cognitive abilities are able to process or is it just\n\n39:42.020 --> 39:44.060\n a mathematical tool?\n\n39:44.060 --> 39:45.060\n It's somewhere in between, right?\n\n39:45.060 --> 39:46.420\n I mean, we can say things about it.\n\n39:46.420 --> 39:51.220\n We can use mathematical tools to manipulate infinity very, very accurately.\n\n39:51.220 --> 39:52.980\n We can define what we mean.\n\n39:52.980 --> 39:56.180\n You know, for any number n, there's a number bigger than it.\n\n39:56.180 --> 39:58.180\n So there's no biggest number, right?\n\n39:58.180 --> 40:00.580\n So there's something called the total number of all numbers.\n\n40:00.580 --> 40:01.640\n It's infinite.\n\n40:01.640 --> 40:07.180\n But it is hard to wrap your brain around that, and I think that gives people pause because\n\n40:07.180 --> 40:11.380\n we talk about infinity as if it's a number, but it has plenty of properties that real\n\n40:11.380 --> 40:12.380\n numbers don't have.\n\n40:12.380 --> 40:15.820\n You know, if you multiply infinity by two, you get infinity again, right?\n\n40:15.820 --> 40:18.500\n That's a little bit different than what we're used to.\n\n40:18.500 --> 40:19.500\n Okay.\n\n40:19.500 --> 40:25.780\n But are you comfortable with the idea that in thinking of what the real world actually\n\n40:25.780 --> 40:28.780\n is that infinity could be part of that world?\n\n40:28.780 --> 40:31.380\n Are you comfortable that a world in some dimension, in some aspect?\n\n40:31.380 --> 40:33.020\n I'm comfortable with lots of things.\n\n40:33.020 --> 40:40.740\n I mean, you know, I don't want my level of comfort to affect what I think about the world.\n\n40:40.740 --> 40:44.020\n You know, I'm pretty open minded about what the world could be at the fundamental level.\n\n40:44.020 --> 40:47.900\n Yeah, but infinity is a tricky one.\n\n40:47.900 --> 40:50.460\n It's not almost a question of comfort.\n\n40:50.460 --> 40:56.420\n It's a question of, is it an overreach of our intuition?\n\n40:56.420 --> 41:01.180\n Sort of, it could be a convenient, almost like when you add a constant to an equation\n\n41:01.180 --> 41:06.860\n just because it'll help, it just feels like it's useful to at least be able to imagine\n\n41:06.860 --> 41:13.380\n a concept, not directly, but in some kind of way that this feels like it's a description\n\n41:13.380 --> 41:14.380\n of the real world.\n\n41:14.380 --> 41:15.940\n Think of it this way.\n\n41:15.940 --> 41:19.420\n There's only three numbers that are simple.\n\n41:19.420 --> 41:24.380\n There's zero, there's one, and there's infinity.\n\n41:24.380 --> 41:29.580\n A number like 318 is just bizarre.\n\n41:29.580 --> 41:33.220\n You need a lot of bits to give me what that number is.\n\n41:33.220 --> 41:36.660\n But zero and one and infinity, like once you have 300 things, you might as well have infinity\n\n41:36.660 --> 41:37.660\n things, right?\n\n41:37.660 --> 41:40.060\n Otherwise, you have to say when to stop making the things, right?\n\n41:40.060 --> 41:44.860\n So there's a sense in which infinity is a very natural number of things to exist.\n\n41:44.860 --> 41:50.420\n I was never comfortable with infinity because it's just such a, it was too good to be true.\n\n41:50.420 --> 41:55.780\n Because in math, it just helps make things work out.\n\n41:55.780 --> 42:02.800\n When things get very large, close to infinity, things seem to work out nicely.\n\n42:02.800 --> 42:07.740\n It's kind of like, because my deepest passion is probably psychology.\n\n42:07.740 --> 42:18.660\n And I'm uncomfortable how in the average, the beauty of how much we vary is lost.\n\n42:18.660 --> 42:24.340\n In that same kind of sense, infinity seems like a convenient way to erase the details.\n\n42:24.340 --> 42:29.320\n But the thing about infinity is it seems to pop up whether we like it or not, right?\n\n42:29.320 --> 42:33.020\n Like you're trying to be a computer scientist, you ask yourself, well, how long will it take\n\n42:33.020 --> 42:34.540\n this program to run?\n\n42:34.540 --> 42:37.440\n And you realize, well, for some of them, the answer is infinitely long.\n\n42:37.440 --> 42:39.540\n It's not because you tried to get there.\n\n42:39.540 --> 42:43.420\n You wrote a five line computer program, it doesn't halt.\n\n42:43.420 --> 42:48.220\n So coming back to the textbook definition of quantum mechanics, this idea that I don't\n\n42:48.220 --> 42:55.300\n think we talked about, can you, this one of the most interesting philosophical points,\n\n42:55.300 --> 43:02.100\n we talked at the human level, but at the physics level, that at least the textbook definition\n\n43:02.100 --> 43:07.660\n of quantum mechanics separates what is observed and what is real.\n\n43:07.660 --> 43:13.100\n One, how does that make you feel?\n\n43:13.100 --> 43:19.020\n And two, what does it then mean to observe something and why is it different than what\n\n43:19.020 --> 43:20.020\n is real?\n\n43:20.020 --> 43:27.700\n Yeah, you know, my personal feeling, such as it is, is that things like measurement\n\n43:27.700 --> 43:32.100\n and observers and stuff like that are not going to play a fundamental role in the ultimate\n\n43:32.100 --> 43:33.100\n laws of physics.\n\n43:33.100 --> 43:38.500\n But my feeling that way is because so far, that's where all the evidence has been pointing.\n\n43:38.500 --> 43:39.960\n I could be wrong.\n\n43:39.960 --> 43:45.920\n And there's certainly a sense in which it would be infinitely cool if somehow observation\n\n43:45.920 --> 43:52.180\n or mental cogitation did play a fundamental role in the nature of reality.\n\n43:52.180 --> 43:53.180\n But I don't think so.\n\n43:53.180 --> 43:54.580\n And again, I don't see any evidence for it.\n\n43:54.580 --> 43:58.280\n So I'm not spending a lot of time worrying about that possibility.\n\n43:58.280 --> 44:02.020\n So what do you do about the fact that in the textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics,\n\n44:02.020 --> 44:07.860\n this idea of measurement or looking at things seems to play an important role?\n\n44:07.860 --> 44:11.780\n Well, you come up with better interpretations of quantum mechanics and there are several\n\n44:11.780 --> 44:12.780\n alternatives.\n\n44:12.780 --> 44:17.180\n My favorite is the many worlds interpretation, which says two things.\n\n44:17.180 --> 44:22.180\n Number one, you, the observer, are just a quantum system like anything else.\n\n44:22.180 --> 44:23.660\n There's nothing special about you.\n\n44:23.660 --> 44:27.260\n Don't get so proud of yourself, you know, you're just a bunch of atoms.\n\n44:27.260 --> 44:31.300\n You have a wave function, you obey the Schrodinger equation like everything else.\n\n44:31.300 --> 44:35.940\n And number two, when you think you're measuring something or observing something, what's really\n\n44:35.940 --> 44:40.480\n happening is you're becoming entangled with that thing.\n\n44:40.480 --> 44:43.820\n So when you think there's a wave function for the electron, it's all spread out.\n\n44:43.820 --> 44:46.660\n But you look at it and you only see it in one location.\n\n44:46.660 --> 44:50.060\n What's really happening is that there's still the wave function for the electron in all\n\n44:50.060 --> 44:51.060\n those locations.\n\n44:51.060 --> 44:55.960\n But now it's entangled with the wave function of you in the following way.\n\n44:55.960 --> 44:59.340\n There's part of the wave function that says the electron was here and you think you saw\n\n44:59.340 --> 45:00.340\n it there.\n\n45:00.340 --> 45:02.380\n The electron was there and you think you saw it there.\n\n45:02.380 --> 45:05.620\n The electron was over there and you think you saw it there, etc.\n\n45:05.620 --> 45:10.260\n So in all of those different parts of the wave function, once they come into being,\n\n45:10.260 --> 45:11.600\n no longer talk to each other.\n\n45:11.600 --> 45:13.820\n They no longer interact or influence each other.\n\n45:13.820 --> 45:16.380\n It's as if they are separate worlds.\n\n45:16.380 --> 45:21.620\n So this was the invention of Hugh Everett III, who was a graduate student at Princeton\n\n45:21.620 --> 45:22.620\n in the 1950s.\n\n45:22.620 --> 45:28.600\n And he said, basically, look, you don't need all these extra rules about looking at things.\n\n45:28.600 --> 45:31.020\n Just listen to what the Schrodinger equation is telling you.\n\n45:31.020 --> 45:35.300\n It's telling you that you have a wave function, that you become entangled, and that the different\n\n45:35.300 --> 45:37.820\n versions of you no longer talk to each other.\n\n45:37.820 --> 45:39.420\n So just accept it.\n\n45:39.420 --> 45:41.540\n It's just he did therapy more than anything else.\n\n45:41.540 --> 45:42.980\n He said, like, it's okay.\n\n45:42.980 --> 45:45.060\n You don't need all these extra rules.\n\n45:45.060 --> 45:47.200\n All you need to do is believe the Schrodinger equation.\n\n45:47.200 --> 45:50.140\n The cost is there's a whole bunch of extra worlds out there.\n\n45:50.140 --> 45:57.340\n So are the worlds being created whether there's an observer or not?\n\n45:57.340 --> 46:01.520\n The worlds are created any time a quantum system that's in a superposition becomes entangled\n\n46:01.520 --> 46:04.020\n with the outside world.\n\n46:04.020 --> 46:06.140\n What's the outside world?\n\n46:06.140 --> 46:07.140\n It depends.\n\n46:07.140 --> 46:08.700\n Let's back up.\n\n46:08.700 --> 46:13.980\n Whatever it really says, what his theory is, is there's a wave function of the universe\n\n46:13.980 --> 46:17.240\n and it obeys the Schrodinger equation all the time.\n\n46:17.240 --> 46:18.240\n That's it.\n\n46:18.240 --> 46:20.580\n That's the full theory right there.\n\n46:20.580 --> 46:27.140\n The question, all of the work is how in the world do you map that theory onto reality,\n\n46:27.140 --> 46:29.280\n onto what we observe?\n\n46:29.280 --> 46:33.740\n So part of it is carving up the wave function into these separate worlds, saying, look,\n\n46:33.740 --> 46:36.180\n it describes a whole bunch of things that don't interact with each other.\n\n46:36.180 --> 46:38.120\n Let's call them separate worlds.\n\n46:38.120 --> 46:41.860\n Another part is distinguishing between systems and their environments.\n\n46:41.860 --> 46:45.660\n The environment is basically all the degrees of freedom, all the things going on in the\n\n46:45.660 --> 46:48.100\n world that you don't keep track of.\n\n46:48.100 --> 46:52.980\n So again, in the bottle of water, I might keep track of the total amount of water and\n\n46:52.980 --> 46:53.980\n the volume.\n\n46:53.980 --> 46:57.140\n I don't keep track of the individual positions and velocities.\n\n46:57.140 --> 47:00.700\n I don't keep track of all the photons or the air molecules in this room.\n\n47:00.700 --> 47:02.120\n So that's the outside world.\n\n47:02.120 --> 47:06.180\n The outside world is all the parts of the universe that you're not keeping track of\n\n47:06.180 --> 47:10.840\n when you're asking about the behavior of subsystem of it.\n\n47:10.840 --> 47:14.220\n So how many worlds are there?\n\n47:14.220 --> 47:17.100\n Yeah, we don't know that one either.\n\n47:17.100 --> 47:18.860\n There could be an infinite number.\n\n47:18.860 --> 47:21.660\n There could be only a finite number, but it's a big number one way or the other.\n\n47:21.660 --> 47:23.860\n It's just a very, very big number.\n\n47:23.860 --> 47:32.020\n In one of the talks, somebody asked, well, if it's finite.\n\n47:32.020 --> 47:38.700\n So actually I'm not sure exactly the logic you used to derive this, but is there going\n\n47:38.700 --> 47:47.540\n to be overlap, a duplicate world that you return to?\n\n47:47.540 --> 47:52.020\n So you've mentioned, and I'd love if you can elaborate on sort of idea that it's possible\n\n47:52.020 --> 47:56.780\n that there's some kind of equilibrium that these splitting worlds arrive at and then\n\n47:56.780 --> 48:03.700\n maybe over time, maybe somehow connected to entropy, you get a large number of worlds\n\n48:03.700 --> 48:05.260\n that are very similar to each other.\n\n48:05.260 --> 48:06.260\n Yeah.\n\n48:06.260 --> 48:11.860\n So this question of whether or not Hilbert space is finite or infinite dimensional is\n\n48:11.860 --> 48:16.420\n actually secretly connected to gravity and cosmology.\n\n48:16.420 --> 48:19.460\n This is the part that we're still struggling to understand right now, but we discovered\n\n48:19.460 --> 48:25.220\n back in 1998 that our universe is accelerating and what that means if it continues, which\n\n48:25.220 --> 48:26.940\n we think it probably will, but we're not sure.\n\n48:26.940 --> 48:31.340\n But if it does, that means there's a horizon around us.\n\n48:31.340 --> 48:34.820\n Because the universe is not only expanding, but expanding faster and faster, things can\n\n48:34.820 --> 48:40.220\n get so far away from us that from our perspective, it looks like they're moving away faster in\n\n48:40.220 --> 48:41.220\n the speed of light.\n\n48:41.220 --> 48:42.580\n We will never see them again.\n\n48:42.580 --> 48:47.400\n So there's literally a horizon around us and that horizon approaches some fixed distance\n\n48:47.400 --> 48:48.780\n away from us.\n\n48:48.780 --> 48:53.260\n And you can then argue that within that horizon, there's only a finite number of things that\n\n48:53.260 --> 48:55.980\n can possibly happen, the finite dimensional Hilbert space.\n\n48:55.980 --> 48:59.500\n In fact, we even have a guess for what the dimensionality is.\n\n48:59.500 --> 49:04.540\n It's 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 122.\n\n49:04.540 --> 49:05.540\n That's a very large number.\n\n49:05.540 --> 49:06.540\n Yes.\n\n49:06.540 --> 49:11.340\n Just to compare, the age of the universe is something like 10 to the 14 seconds, 10 to\n\n49:11.340 --> 49:13.340\n the 17 or 18 seconds maybe.\n\n49:13.340 --> 49:16.300\n The number of particles in the universe is 10 to the 88th.\n\n49:16.300 --> 49:21.320\n But the number of dimensions of Hilbert space is 10 to the 10 to the 122.\n\n49:21.320 --> 49:23.340\n So that's just crazy big.\n\n49:23.340 --> 49:28.020\n If that story is right, that in our observable horizon, there's only a finite dimensional\n\n49:28.020 --> 49:32.620\n Hilbert space, then this idea of branching of the wave function of the universe into\n\n49:32.620 --> 49:37.780\n multiple distinct separate branches has to reach a limit at some time.\n\n49:37.780 --> 49:41.780\n Once you branch that many times, you've run out of room in Hilbert space.\n\n49:41.780 --> 49:46.620\n And roughly speaking, that corresponds to the universe just expanding and emptying out\n\n49:46.620 --> 49:53.380\n and cooling off and entering a phase where it's just empty space, literally forever.\n\n49:53.380 --> 49:58.900\n What's the difference between splitting and copying, do you think?\n\n49:58.900 --> 50:09.220\n In terms of, a lot of this is an interpretation that helps us sort of model the world.\n\n50:09.220 --> 50:16.860\n So perhaps shouldn't be thought of as like, you know, philosophically or metaphysically.\n\n50:16.860 --> 50:24.180\n But in even at the physics level, do you see a difference between generating new copies\n\n50:24.180 --> 50:26.900\n of the world or splitting?\n\n50:26.900 --> 50:31.700\n I think it's better to think of in quantum mechanics in many worlds, the universe splits\n\n50:31.700 --> 50:36.540\n rather than new copies, because people otherwise worry about things like energy conservation.\n\n50:36.540 --> 50:40.340\n And no one who understands quantum mechanics worries about energy conservation, because\n\n50:40.340 --> 50:42.340\n the equation is perfectly clear.\n\n50:42.340 --> 50:45.720\n But if all you know is that someone told you the universe duplicates, then you have a reasonable\n\n50:45.720 --> 50:48.660\n worry about where all the energy for that came from.\n\n50:48.660 --> 50:53.620\n So a pre existing universe splitting into two skinnier universes is a better way of\n\n50:53.620 --> 50:54.620\n thinking about it.\n\n50:54.620 --> 50:58.380\n And mathematically, it's just like, you know, if you draw an x and y axis, and you draw\n\n50:58.380 --> 51:04.540\n a vector of length one, 45 degree angle, you know that you can write that vector of length\n\n51:04.540 --> 51:10.420\n one as the sum of two vectors pointing along x and y of length one over the square root\n\n51:10.420 --> 51:11.420\n of two.\n\n51:11.420 --> 51:14.940\n Okay, so I write one arrow as the sum of two arrows.\n\n51:14.940 --> 51:17.020\n But there's a conservation of arrowness, right?\n\n51:17.020 --> 51:20.940\n Like there's now two arrows, but the length is the same, I just I'm describing it in a\n\n51:20.940 --> 51:21.940\n different way.\n\n51:21.940 --> 51:25.700\n And that's exactly what happens when the universe branches, the the wave function of the universe\n\n51:25.700 --> 51:27.380\n is a big old vector.\n\n51:27.380 --> 51:34.020\n So to somebody who brings up a question of saying, doesn't this violate the conservation\n\n51:34.020 --> 51:35.420\n of energy?\n\n51:35.420 --> 51:38.060\n Can you give further elaboration?\n\n51:38.060 --> 51:39.060\n Right?\n\n51:39.060 --> 51:42.100\n So let's just be super duper perfectly clear.\n\n51:42.100 --> 51:46.700\n There's zero question about whether or not many worlds violates conservation of energy.\n\n51:46.700 --> 51:47.700\n Yes, it does not.\n\n51:47.700 --> 51:48.700\n Great.\n\n51:48.700 --> 51:51.980\n And I say this definitively, because there are other questions that I think there's answers\n\n51:51.980 --> 51:55.620\n to, but they're legitimate questions, right about, you know, where does probability come\n\n51:55.620 --> 51:59.900\n from and things like that, this conservation of energy question, we know the answer to\n\n51:59.900 --> 52:00.900\n it.\n\n52:00.900 --> 52:03.020\n And the answer to it is that energy is conserved.\n\n52:03.020 --> 52:09.220\n All of the effort goes into how best to translate what the equation unambiguously says into\n\n52:09.220 --> 52:11.040\n plain English, right?\n\n52:11.040 --> 52:14.480\n So this idea that there's a universe that has that that the universe comes equipped\n\n52:14.480 --> 52:18.700\n with a thickness, and it sort of divides up into thinner pieces, but the total amount\n\n52:18.700 --> 52:25.360\n of universe is is conserved over time, is a reasonably good way of putting English words\n\n52:25.360 --> 52:27.380\n to the underlying mathematics.\n\n52:27.380 --> 52:33.220\n So one of my favorite things about many worlds is, I mean, I love that there's something\n\n52:33.220 --> 52:35.400\n controversial in science.\n\n52:35.400 --> 52:41.780\n And for some reason, it makes people actually not like upset, but just get excited.\n\n52:41.780 --> 52:45.960\n Why do you think it is a controversial idea?\n\n52:45.960 --> 52:52.380\n So there's a lot of, it's actually one of the cleanest ways to think about quantum mechanics.\n\n52:52.380 --> 52:57.380\n So why do you think there's a discomfort a little bit among certain people?\n\n52:57.380 --> 53:02.740\n Well, I draw the distinction in my book between two different kinds of simplicity in a physical\n\n53:02.740 --> 53:03.740\n theory.\n\n53:03.740 --> 53:06.300\n There's simplicity in the theory itself, right?\n\n53:06.300 --> 53:10.220\n How we describe what's going on according to the theory by its own rights.\n\n53:10.220 --> 53:13.480\n But then, you know, theory is just some sort of abstract mathematical formalism, you have\n\n53:13.480 --> 53:16.860\n to map it onto the world somehow, right?\n\n53:16.860 --> 53:23.000\n And sometimes, like for Newtonian physics, it's pretty obvious, like, okay, here is a\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:26.260\n bottle and has a center of mass and things like that.\n\n53:26.260 --> 53:30.660\n Sometimes it's a little bit harder with general relativity, curvature of space time is a little\n\n53:30.660 --> 53:33.180\n bit harder to grasp.\n\n53:33.180 --> 53:37.620\n quantum mechanics is very hard to map what you're the language you're talking in a wave\n\n53:37.620 --> 53:40.460\n functions and things like that on to reality.\n\n53:40.460 --> 53:45.260\n And many worlds is the version of quantum mechanics where it is hardest to map on the\n\n53:45.260 --> 53:47.860\n underlying formalism to reality.\n\n53:47.860 --> 53:53.260\n So that's where the lack of simplicity comes in, not in the theory, but in how we use the\n\n53:53.260 --> 53:54.660\n theory to map on to reality.\n\n53:54.660 --> 54:01.740\n In fact, all of the work in sort of elaborating many worlds quantum mechanics is in the this\n\n54:01.740 --> 54:04.420\n effort to map it on to the world that we see.\n\n54:04.420 --> 54:08.340\n So it's perfectly legitimate to be bugged by that, right?\n\n54:08.340 --> 54:15.320\n To say like, well, no, that's just too far away from my experience, I am therefore intrinsically\n\n54:15.320 --> 54:16.580\n skeptical of it.\n\n54:16.580 --> 54:19.620\n Of course, you should give up on that skepticism if there are no alternatives.\n\n54:19.620 --> 54:23.280\n And this theory always keeps working, then eventually you should overcome your skepticism.\n\n54:23.280 --> 54:28.060\n But right now there are alternatives that are that, you know, people work to make alternatives\n\n54:28.060 --> 54:31.780\n that are by their nature closer to what we observe directly.\n\n54:31.780 --> 54:33.180\n Can you describe the alternatives?\n\n54:33.180 --> 54:40.480\n I don't think we touched on it, sort of the Copenhagen interpretation and the many worlds.\n\n54:40.480 --> 54:47.260\n Maybe there's a difference between the Everettian many worlds and many worlds as it is now,\n\n54:47.260 --> 54:50.020\n like has the idea sort of developed and so on.\n\n54:50.020 --> 54:54.060\n And just in general, what is the space of promising contenders?\n\n54:54.060 --> 54:57.060\n We have democratic debates now, there's a bunch of candidates.\n\n54:57.060 --> 54:59.540\n 12 candidates on stage.\n\n54:59.540 --> 55:02.480\n What are the quantum mechanical candidates on stage for the debate?\n\n55:02.480 --> 55:08.540\n So if you had a debate between quantum mechanical contenders, there'd be no problem getting\n\n55:08.540 --> 55:14.220\n 12 people up there on stage, but there would still be only three front runners.\n\n55:14.220 --> 55:19.460\n And right now the front runners would be Everett, hidden variable theories are another one.\n\n55:19.460 --> 55:24.180\n So the hidden variable theories say that the wave function is real, but there's something\n\n55:24.180 --> 55:25.820\n in addition to the wave function.\n\n55:25.820 --> 55:29.440\n The wave function is not everything, it's part of reality, but it's not everything.\n\n55:29.440 --> 55:30.880\n What else is there?\n\n55:30.880 --> 55:36.020\n We're not sure, but in the simplest version of the theory, there are literally particles.\n\n55:36.020 --> 55:43.100\n So many worlds says that quantum systems are sometimes are wave like in some ways and particle\n\n55:43.100 --> 55:48.060\n like in another because they really, really are waves, but under certain observational\n\n55:48.060 --> 55:50.460\n circumstances they look like particles.\n\n55:50.460 --> 55:54.980\n Whereas hidden variable says they look like waves and particles because there are both\n\n55:54.980 --> 55:58.760\n waves and particles involved in the dynamics.\n\n55:58.760 --> 56:03.780\n And that's easy to do if your particles are just non relativistic Newtonian particles\n\n56:03.780 --> 56:04.780\n moving around.\n\n56:04.780 --> 56:07.740\n They get pushed around by the wave function roughly.\n\n56:07.740 --> 56:13.300\n It becomes much harder when you take quantum field theory or quantum gravity into account.\n\n56:13.300 --> 56:17.820\n The other big contender are spontaneous collapse theories.\n\n56:17.820 --> 56:22.580\n So in the conventional textbook interpretation, we say when you look at a quantum system,\n\n56:22.580 --> 56:27.260\n its wave function collapses and you see it in one location, a spontaneous collapse theory\n\n56:27.260 --> 56:35.340\n says that every particle has a chance per second of having its wave function spontaneously\n\n56:35.340 --> 56:36.460\n collapse.\n\n56:36.460 --> 56:39.980\n The chance is very small for a typical particle, it will take hundreds of millions of years\n\n56:39.980 --> 56:44.380\n before it happens even once, but in a table or some macroscopic object, there are way\n\n56:44.380 --> 56:48.140\n more than a hundred million particles and they're all entangled with each other.\n\n56:48.140 --> 56:52.860\n So when one of them collapses, it brings everything else along with it.\n\n56:52.860 --> 56:54.260\n There's a slight variation of this.\n\n56:54.260 --> 56:55.620\n That's a spontaneous collapse theory.\n\n56:55.620 --> 57:00.260\n There are also induced collapse theories like Roger Penrose thinks that when the gravitational\n\n57:00.260 --> 57:05.500\n difference between two parts of the wave function becomes too large, the wave function collapses\n\n57:05.500 --> 57:06.860\n automatically.\n\n57:06.860 --> 57:11.700\n So those are basically in my mind, the three big alternatives, many worlds, which is just\n\n57:11.700 --> 57:16.060\n there's a wave function and always obeys the Schrodinger equation, hidden variables.\n\n57:16.060 --> 57:18.820\n There's a wave function that always obeys the Schrodinger equation, but there are also\n\n57:18.820 --> 57:24.420\n new variables or collapse theories, which the wave function sometimes obeys the Schrodinger\n\n57:24.420 --> 57:26.220\n equation and sometimes it collapses.\n\n57:26.220 --> 57:31.380\n So you can see that the alternatives are more complicated in their formalism than many worlds\n\n57:31.380 --> 57:34.380\n is, but they are closer to our experience.\n\n57:34.380 --> 57:42.220\n So just this moment of collapse, do you think of it as a wave function, fundamentally sort\n\n57:42.220 --> 57:49.140\n of a probabilistic description of the world and this collapse sort of reducing that part\n\n57:49.140 --> 57:53.740\n of the world into something deterministic, where again, you can now describe the position\n\n57:53.740 --> 57:56.980\n and the velocity in this simple classical model?\n\n57:56.980 --> 57:57.980\n Well there is...\n\n57:57.980 --> 57:58.980\n Is that how you think about collapse?\n\n57:58.980 --> 58:03.140\n There is a fourth category, there's a fourth contender, there's a mayor Pete of quantum\n\n58:03.140 --> 58:08.140\n mechanical interpretations, which are called epistemic interpretations.\n\n58:08.140 --> 58:13.220\n And what they say is all the wave function is, is a way of making predictions for experimental\n\n58:13.220 --> 58:14.220\n outcomes.\n\n58:14.220 --> 58:18.780\n It's not mapping onto an element of reality in any real sense.\n\n58:18.780 --> 58:22.300\n And in fact, two different people might have two different wave functions for the same\n\n58:22.300 --> 58:25.340\n physical system because they know different things about it, right?\n\n58:25.340 --> 58:28.100\n The wave function is really just a prediction mechanism.\n\n58:28.100 --> 58:32.980\n And then the problem with those epistemic interpretations is if you say, okay, but it's\n\n58:32.980 --> 58:37.980\n predicting about what, like what is the thing that is being predicted?\n\n58:37.980 --> 58:41.460\n And they say, no, no, no, that's not what we're here for.\n\n58:41.460 --> 58:44.500\n We're just here to tell you what the observational outcomes are going to be.\n\n58:44.500 --> 58:49.100\n But the other, the other interpretations kind of think that the wave function is real.\n\n58:49.100 --> 58:50.760\n Yes, that's right.\n\n58:50.760 --> 58:55.980\n So that's an ontic interpretation of the wave function, ontology being the study of what\n\n58:55.980 --> 59:01.060\n is real, what exists, as opposed to an epistemic interpretation of the wave function, epistemology\n\n59:01.060 --> 59:02.060\n being the study of what we know.\n\n59:02.060 --> 59:06.580\n That would actually just love to see that debate on stage.\n\n59:06.580 --> 59:10.500\n There was a version of it on stage at the world science festival a few years ago that\n\n59:10.500 --> 59:11.500\n you can look up online.\n\n59:11.500 --> 59:12.500\n On YouTube?\n\n59:12.500 --> 59:13.500\n Yep.\n\n59:13.500 --> 59:14.500\n It's on YouTube.\n\n59:14.500 --> 59:15.500\n Okay, awesome.\n\n59:15.500 --> 59:16.500\n I'll link it and watch it.\n\n59:16.500 --> 59:17.500\n Who won?\n\n59:17.500 --> 59:18.500\n I won.\n\n59:18.500 --> 59:24.700\n I don't know, there was no vote, there was no vote, but those there's Brian Green was\n\n59:24.700 --> 59:29.420\n the moderator and David Albert stood up for a spontaneous collapse and Shelley Goldstein\n\n59:29.420 --> 59:34.460\n was there for hidden variables and R\u00fcdiger Schock was there for epistemic approaches.\n\n59:34.460 --> 59:38.980\n Why do you, I think you mentioned it, but just to elaborate, why do you find many worlds\n\n59:38.980 --> 59:39.980\n so compelling?\n\n59:39.980 --> 59:43.460\n Well, there's two reasons actually.\n\n59:43.460 --> 59:45.540\n One is, like I said, it is the simplest, right?\n\n59:45.540 --> 59:49.960\n It's like the most bare bones, austere, pure version of quantum mechanics.\n\n59:49.960 --> 59:55.380\n And I am someone who is very willing to put a lot of work into mapping the formalism onto\n\n59:55.380 --> 59:56.380\n reality.\n\n59:56.380 --> 59:59.100\n I'm less willing to complicate the formalism itself.\n\n59:59.100 --> 1:00:04.180\n But the other big reason is that there's something called modern physics with quantum fields\n\n1:00:04.180 --> 1:00:09.280\n and quantum gravity and holography and space time doing things like that.\n\n1:00:09.280 --> 1:00:14.540\n And when you take any of the other versions of quantum theory, they bring along classical\n\n1:00:14.540 --> 1:00:21.820\n baggage, all of the other versions of quantum mechanics, prejudice or privilege some version\n\n1:00:21.820 --> 1:00:26.020\n of classical reality like locations in space, okay?\n\n1:00:26.020 --> 1:00:31.220\n And I think that that's a barrier to doing better at understanding the theory of everything\n\n1:00:31.220 --> 1:00:34.460\n and understanding quantum gravity and the emergence of space time.\n\n1:00:34.460 --> 1:00:38.660\n Whenever if you change your theory from, you know, here's a harmonic oscillator, oh, there's\n\n1:00:38.660 --> 1:00:43.640\n a spin, here's an electromagnetic field, in hidden variable theories or dynamical collapse\n\n1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:44.640\n theories.\n\n1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:45.640\n You have to start from scratch.\n\n1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:48.220\n You have to say like, well, what are the hidden variables for this theory or how does it collapse\n\n1:00:48.220 --> 1:00:49.220\n or whatever?\n\n1:00:49.220 --> 1:00:50.900\n Whereas many worlds is plug and play.\n\n1:00:50.900 --> 1:00:53.900\n You tell me the theory and I can give you as many worlds version.\n\n1:00:53.900 --> 1:00:58.900\n So when we have a situation like we have with gravity and space time, where the classical\n\n1:00:58.900 --> 1:01:04.100\n description seems to break down in a dramatic way, then I think you should start from the\n\n1:01:04.100 --> 1:01:07.160\n most quantum theory that you have, which is really many worlds.\n\n1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:14.940\n So start with the quantum theory and try to build up a model of space time, the emergence\n\n1:01:14.940 --> 1:01:15.940\n of space time.\n\n1:01:15.940 --> 1:01:16.940\n That's it.\n\n1:01:16.940 --> 1:01:17.940\n Okay.\n\n1:01:17.940 --> 1:01:21.020\n So I thought space time was fundamental.\n\n1:01:21.020 --> 1:01:22.360\n Yeah, I know.\n\n1:01:22.360 --> 1:01:28.860\n So this sort of dream that Einstein had that everybody had and everybody has of, you know,\n\n1:01:28.860 --> 1:01:30.660\n the theory of everything.\n\n1:01:30.660 --> 1:01:37.460\n So how do we build up from many worlds from quantum mechanics, a model of space time model\n\n1:01:37.460 --> 1:01:38.460\n of gravity?\n\n1:01:38.460 --> 1:01:42.580\n Well, yeah, I mean, let me first mention very quickly why we think it's necessary.\n\n1:01:42.580 --> 1:01:47.420\n You know, we've had gravity in the form that Einstein bequeathed it to us for over a hundred\n\n1:01:47.420 --> 1:01:52.600\n years now, like 1915 or 1916, he put general relativity in the final form.\n\n1:01:52.600 --> 1:01:57.020\n So gravity is the curvature of space time and there's a field that pervades all the\n\n1:01:57.020 --> 1:02:00.100\n universe that tells us how curved space time is.\n\n1:02:00.100 --> 1:02:01.980\n And that's a fundamentally classical.\n\n1:02:01.980 --> 1:02:02.980\n That's totally classical.\n\n1:02:02.980 --> 1:02:03.980\n Right.\n\n1:02:03.980 --> 1:02:04.980\n Exactly.\n\n1:02:04.980 --> 1:02:09.980\n But we also have a formalism, an algorithm for taking a classical theory and quantizing\n\n1:02:09.980 --> 1:02:10.980\n it.\n\n1:02:10.980 --> 1:02:13.900\n This is how we get quantum electrodynamics, for example.\n\n1:02:13.900 --> 1:02:14.900\n And it could be tricky.\n\n1:02:14.900 --> 1:02:19.500\n I mean, you think you're quantizing something, so that means taking a classical theory and\n\n1:02:19.500 --> 1:02:22.400\n promoting it to a quantum mechanical theory.\n\n1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:23.940\n But you can run into problems.\n\n1:02:23.940 --> 1:02:27.460\n So they ran into problems and they did that with electromagnetism, namely that certain\n\n1:02:27.460 --> 1:02:30.300\n quantities were infinity and you don't like infinity, right?\n\n1:02:30.300 --> 1:02:35.200\n So Feynman and Tominaga and Schwinger won the Nobel Prize for teaching us how to deal\n\n1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:36.200\n with the infinities.\n\n1:02:36.200 --> 1:02:39.320\n And then Ken Wilson won another Nobel Prize for saying you shouldn't have been worried\n\n1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:41.380\n about those infinities after all.\n\n1:02:41.380 --> 1:02:45.400\n But still, that was the, it's always the thought that that's how you will make a good quantum\n\n1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:46.400\n theory.\n\n1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:47.860\n You'll start with a classical theory and quantize it.\n\n1:02:47.860 --> 1:02:51.760\n So if we have a classical theory, general relativity, we can quantize it or we can try\n\n1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:57.780\n to, but we run into even bigger problems with gravity than we ran into with electromagnetism.\n\n1:02:57.780 --> 1:03:00.060\n And so far, those problems are insurmountable.\n\n1:03:00.060 --> 1:03:04.980\n We've not been able to get a successful theory of gravity, quantum gravity, by starting with\n\n1:03:04.980 --> 1:03:08.020\n classical general relativity and quantizing it.\n\n1:03:08.020 --> 1:03:12.700\n And there's evidence that, there's a good reason why this is true, that whatever the\n\n1:03:12.700 --> 1:03:17.020\n quantum theory of gravity is, it's not a field theory.\n\n1:03:17.020 --> 1:03:22.300\n It's something that has weird nonlocal features built into it somehow that we don't understand.\n\n1:03:22.300 --> 1:03:27.540\n We get this idea from black holes and Hawking radiation and information conservation and\n\n1:03:27.540 --> 1:03:30.180\n a whole bunch of other ideas I talk about in the book.\n\n1:03:30.180 --> 1:03:34.580\n So if that's true, if the fundamental theory isn't even local in the sense that an ordinary\n\n1:03:34.580 --> 1:03:39.060\n quantum field theory would be, then we just don't know where to start in terms of getting\n\n1:03:39.060 --> 1:03:42.400\n a classical precursor and quantizing it.\n\n1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:46.220\n So the only sensible thing, or at least the next obvious sensible thing to me would be\n\n1:03:46.220 --> 1:03:50.020\n to say, okay, let's just start intrinsically quantum and work backwards, see if we can\n\n1:03:50.020 --> 1:03:51.020\n find a classical limit.\n\n1:03:51.020 --> 1:04:03.900\n So the idea of locality, the fact that locality is not fundamental to the nature of our existence,\n\n1:04:03.900 --> 1:04:07.460\n I guess in that sense, modeling everything as a field makes sense to me.\n\n1:04:07.460 --> 1:04:12.300\n Stuff that's close by interacts, stuff that's far away doesn't.\n\n1:04:12.300 --> 1:04:15.580\n So what's locality and why is it not fundamental?\n\n1:04:15.580 --> 1:04:16.580\n And how is that even possible?\n\n1:04:16.580 --> 1:04:17.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:17.580 --> 1:04:21.260\n I mean, locality is the answer to the question that Isaac Newton was worried about back in\n\n1:04:21.260 --> 1:04:22.580\n the beginning of our conversation, right?\n\n1:04:22.580 --> 1:04:27.300\n I mean, how can the earth know what the gravitational field of the sun is?\n\n1:04:27.300 --> 1:04:31.340\n And the answer as spelled out by Laplace and Einstein and others is that there's a field\n\n1:04:31.340 --> 1:04:32.340\n in between.\n\n1:04:32.340 --> 1:04:38.660\n And the way a field works is that what's happening to the field at this point in space only depends\n\n1:04:38.660 --> 1:04:41.580\n directly on what's happening at points right next to it.\n\n1:04:41.580 --> 1:04:45.180\n But what's happening at those points depends on what's happening right next to those, right?\n\n1:04:45.180 --> 1:04:50.620\n And so you can build up an influence across space through only local interactions.\n\n1:04:50.620 --> 1:04:51.860\n That's what locality means.\n\n1:04:51.860 --> 1:04:54.780\n What happens here is only affected by what's happening right next to it.\n\n1:04:54.780 --> 1:04:57.000\n That's locality.\n\n1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:01.460\n The idea of locality is built into every field theory, including general relativity as a\n\n1:05:01.460 --> 1:05:03.100\n classical theory.\n\n1:05:03.100 --> 1:05:07.340\n It seems to break down when we talk about black holes and, you know, Hawking taught\n\n1:05:07.340 --> 1:05:12.520\n us in the 1970s that black holes radiate, they give off, they eventually evaporate away.\n\n1:05:12.520 --> 1:05:17.180\n They're not completely black once we take quantum mechanics into account.\n\n1:05:17.180 --> 1:05:22.540\n And we think, we don't know for sure, but most of us think that if you make a black\n\n1:05:22.540 --> 1:05:28.380\n hole out of certain stuff, then like Laplace's demon taught us, you should be able to predict\n\n1:05:28.380 --> 1:05:32.660\n what that black hole will turn into if it's just obeying the Schrodinger equation.\n\n1:05:32.660 --> 1:05:37.820\n And if that's true, there are good arguments that can't happen while preserving locality\n\n1:05:37.820 --> 1:05:38.820\n at the same time.\n\n1:05:38.820 --> 1:05:44.180\n It's just that the information seems to be spread out nonlocally in interesting ways.\n\n1:05:44.180 --> 1:05:49.540\n And people should, you talk about holography with the Leonard Susskind on your Mindscape\n\n1:05:49.540 --> 1:05:50.540\n podcast.\n\n1:05:50.540 --> 1:05:51.540\n Oh yes, I have a podcast.\n\n1:05:51.540 --> 1:05:52.540\n I didn't even mention that.\n\n1:05:52.540 --> 1:05:53.540\n This is terrible.\n\n1:05:53.540 --> 1:05:57.340\n No, I'm going to, I'm going to ask you questions about that too, and I've been not shutting\n\n1:05:57.340 --> 1:05:58.340\n up about it.\n\n1:05:58.340 --> 1:05:59.340\n It's my favorite science podcast.\n\n1:05:59.340 --> 1:06:02.900\n So, or not, it's a, it's not even a science podcast.\n\n1:06:02.900 --> 1:06:06.140\n It's like, it's a scientist doing a podcast.\n\n1:06:06.140 --> 1:06:07.140\n That's right.\n\n1:06:07.140 --> 1:06:08.140\n That's what it is.\n\n1:06:08.140 --> 1:06:09.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:09.140 --> 1:06:10.140\n Anyway.\n\n1:06:10.140 --> 1:06:11.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:11.140 --> 1:06:14.580\n So holography is this idea when you have a black hole and black hole is a region of space\n\n1:06:14.580 --> 1:06:17.580\n inside of which gravity is so strong that you can't escape.\n\n1:06:17.580 --> 1:06:21.980\n And there's this weird feature of black holes that, again, it's totally a thought experiment\n\n1:06:21.980 --> 1:06:24.520\n feature because we haven't gone and probed any yet.\n\n1:06:24.520 --> 1:06:29.960\n But there seems to be one way of thinking about what happens inside a black hole as\n\n1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:33.660\n seen by an observer who's falling in, which is actually pretty normal.\n\n1:06:33.660 --> 1:06:37.020\n Like everything looks pretty normal until you hit the singularity and you die.\n\n1:06:37.020 --> 1:06:41.380\n But from the point of view of the outside observer, it seems like all the information\n\n1:06:41.380 --> 1:06:47.460\n that fell in is actually smeared over the horizon in a nonlocal way.\n\n1:06:47.460 --> 1:06:51.660\n And that's puzzling and that's, so holography because that's a two dimensional surface that\n\n1:06:51.660 --> 1:06:55.420\n is encapsulating the whole three dimensional thing inside, right?\n\n1:06:55.420 --> 1:06:56.420\n Still trying to deal with that.\n\n1:06:56.420 --> 1:06:58.100\n Still trying to figure out how to get there.\n\n1:06:58.100 --> 1:07:01.340\n But it's an indication that we need to think a little bit more subtly when we quantize\n\n1:07:01.340 --> 1:07:02.340\n gravity.\n\n1:07:02.340 --> 1:07:07.460\n And because you can describe everything that's going on in the three dimensional space by\n\n1:07:07.460 --> 1:07:13.900\n looking at the two dimensional projection of it, it means that locality doesn't, it's\n\n1:07:13.900 --> 1:07:14.900\n not necessary.\n\n1:07:14.900 --> 1:07:18.900\n Well, it means that somehow it's only a good approximation.\n\n1:07:18.900 --> 1:07:20.380\n It's not really what's going on.\n\n1:07:20.380 --> 1:07:22.020\n How are we supposed to feel about that?\n\n1:07:22.020 --> 1:07:25.700\n We're supposed to feel liberated.\n\n1:07:25.700 --> 1:07:29.680\n You know, space is just a good approximation and this was always going to be true once\n\n1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:31.680\n you started quantizing gravity.\n\n1:07:31.680 --> 1:07:38.820\n So we're just beginning now to face up to the dramatic implications of quantizing gravity.\n\n1:07:38.820 --> 1:07:43.780\n Is there other weird stuff that happens to quantum mechanics in black hole?\n\n1:07:43.780 --> 1:07:47.020\n I don't think that anything weird has happened with quantum mechanics.\n\n1:07:47.020 --> 1:07:48.620\n I think weird things happen with space time.\n\n1:07:48.620 --> 1:07:49.620\n I mean, that's what it is.\n\n1:07:49.620 --> 1:07:53.680\n Like quantum mechanics is still just quantum mechanics, but our ordinary notions of space\n\n1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:57.620\n time don't really quite work.\n\n1:07:57.620 --> 1:08:03.940\n And there's a principle that goes hand in hand with holography called complementarity,\n\n1:08:03.940 --> 1:08:10.540\n which says that there's no one unique way to describe what's going on inside a black\n\n1:08:10.540 --> 1:08:11.540\n hole.\n\n1:08:11.540 --> 1:08:17.220\n Different observers will have different descriptions, both of which are accurate, but sound completely\n\n1:08:17.220 --> 1:08:18.640\n incompatible with each other.\n\n1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:20.900\n So depends on how you look at it.\n\n1:08:20.900 --> 1:08:25.060\n The word complementarity in this context is borrowed from Niels Bohr, who points out you\n\n1:08:25.060 --> 1:08:28.260\n can measure the position or you can measure the momentum.\n\n1:08:28.260 --> 1:08:30.900\n You can't measure both at the same time in quantum mechanics.\n\n1:08:30.900 --> 1:08:34.900\n So a couple of questions on many worlds.\n\n1:08:34.900 --> 1:08:40.740\n How does many worlds help us understand our particular branch of reality?\n\n1:08:40.740 --> 1:08:45.100\n So okay, that's fine and good that is everything is splitting, but we're just traveling down\n\n1:08:45.100 --> 1:08:46.220\n a single branch of it.\n\n1:08:46.220 --> 1:08:50.780\n So how does it help us understand our little unique branch?\n\n1:08:50.780 --> 1:08:52.840\n Yeah, I mean, that's a great question.\n\n1:08:52.840 --> 1:08:56.260\n But that's the point is that we didn't invent many worlds because we thought it was cool\n\n1:08:56.260 --> 1:08:57.820\n to have a whole bunch of worlds, right?\n\n1:08:57.820 --> 1:09:02.700\n We invented it because we were trying to account for what we observe here in our world.\n\n1:09:02.700 --> 1:09:07.500\n And what we observe here in our world are wave functions collapsing, okay?\n\n1:09:07.500 --> 1:09:11.500\n We do have a position, a situation where the electron seems to be spread out.\n\n1:09:11.500 --> 1:09:13.380\n But then when we look at it, we don't see it spread out.\n\n1:09:13.380 --> 1:09:15.100\n We see it located somewhere.\n\n1:09:15.100 --> 1:09:16.160\n So what's going on?\n\n1:09:16.160 --> 1:09:17.880\n That's the measurement problem of quantum mechanics.\n\n1:09:17.880 --> 1:09:19.400\n That's what we have to face up to.\n\n1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:22.900\n So many worlds is just a proposed solution to that problem.\n\n1:09:22.900 --> 1:09:25.660\n And the answer is nothing special is happening.\n\n1:09:25.660 --> 1:09:30.080\n It's still just the Schrodinger equation, but you have a wave function too.\n\n1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:34.380\n And that's a different answer than would be given in hidden variables or dynamical collapse\n\n1:09:34.380 --> 1:09:36.020\n theories or whatever.\n\n1:09:36.020 --> 1:09:42.100\n So the entire point of many worlds is to explain what we observe, but it tries to explain what\n\n1:09:42.100 --> 1:09:44.280\n we already have observed, right?\n\n1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:48.380\n It's not trying to be different from what we've observed because that would be something\n\n1:09:48.380 --> 1:09:50.240\n other than quantum mechanics.\n\n1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:54.220\n But you know, the idea that there's worlds that we didn't observe that keep branching\n\n1:09:54.220 --> 1:10:00.000\n off is kind of, it's stimulating to the imagination.\n\n1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:08.040\n So is it possible to hop from, you mentioned the branches are independent.\n\n1:10:08.040 --> 1:10:10.260\n Is it possible to hop from one to the other?\n\n1:10:10.260 --> 1:10:11.260\n No.\n\n1:10:11.260 --> 1:10:14.180\n So it's a physical limit.\n\n1:10:14.180 --> 1:10:16.260\n The theory says it's impossible.\n\n1:10:16.260 --> 1:10:18.620\n There's already a copy of you in the other world, don't worry.\n\n1:10:18.620 --> 1:10:19.620\n Yes.\n\n1:10:19.620 --> 1:10:20.620\n Leave them alone.\n\n1:10:20.620 --> 1:10:28.780\n No, but there's a fear of missing out, FOMO, that I feel like immediately start to wonder\n\n1:10:28.780 --> 1:10:32.900\n if that other copy is having more or less fun.\n\n1:10:32.900 --> 1:10:38.620\n Well, the downside to many worlds is that you're missing out on an enormous amount.\n\n1:10:38.620 --> 1:10:40.460\n And that's always what it's going to be like.\n\n1:10:40.460 --> 1:10:44.380\n And I mean, there's a certain stage of acceptance in that.\n\n1:10:44.380 --> 1:10:49.980\n In terms of rewinding, do you think we can rewind the system back, sort of the nice thing\n\n1:10:49.980 --> 1:10:58.800\n about many worlds, I guess, is it really emphasizes the, maybe you can correct me, but the deterministic\n\n1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:05.700\n nature of a branch and it feels like it could be rewound back.\n\n1:11:05.700 --> 1:11:11.900\n Is it, do you see it as something that could be perfectly rewound back, rewinding back?\n\n1:11:11.900 --> 1:11:12.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:11:12.900 --> 1:11:17.060\n If you're at a fancy French restaurant and there's a nice linen white tablecloth and\n\n1:11:17.060 --> 1:11:22.620\n you have your glass of Bordeaux and you knock it over and the wine spills across the tablecloth.\n\n1:11:22.620 --> 1:11:28.440\n If the world were classical, okay, it would be possible that if you just lifted the wine\n\n1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:33.020\n glass up, you'd be lucky enough that every molecule of wine would hop back into the glass,\n\n1:11:33.020 --> 1:11:34.020\n right?\n\n1:11:34.020 --> 1:11:35.020\n But guess what?\n\n1:11:35.020 --> 1:11:37.100\n It's not going to happen in the real world.\n\n1:11:37.100 --> 1:11:40.020\n And the quantum wave function is exactly the same way.\n\n1:11:40.020 --> 1:11:44.540\n It is possible in principle to rewind everything if you start from perfect knowledge of the\n\n1:11:44.540 --> 1:11:46.820\n entire wave function of the universe.\n\n1:11:46.820 --> 1:11:49.320\n In practice, it's never going to happen.\n\n1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:53.020\n So time travel, not possible.\n\n1:11:53.020 --> 1:11:54.020\n Nope.\n\n1:11:54.020 --> 1:11:57.760\n At least quantum mechanics has no help.\n\n1:11:57.760 --> 1:12:00.540\n What about memory?\n\n1:12:00.540 --> 1:12:07.720\n Does the universe have a memory of itself where we could, in, in, so not time travel,\n\n1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:13.100\n but peek back in time and do a little like replay?\n\n1:12:13.100 --> 1:12:18.100\n Well, it's exactly the same in quantum mechanics as classical mechanics.\n\n1:12:18.100 --> 1:12:22.540\n So whatever you want to say about that, you know, the fundamental laws of physics in either\n\n1:12:22.540 --> 1:12:28.100\n many worlds, quantum mechanics or Newtonian physics conserve information.\n\n1:12:28.100 --> 1:12:32.620\n So if you have all the information about the quantum state of the world right now, your\n\n1:12:32.620 --> 1:12:37.500\n Laplace is demon like in your knowledge and calculational capacity, you can wind the clock\n\n1:12:37.500 --> 1:12:38.500\n backward.\n\n1:12:38.500 --> 1:12:39.500\n But none of us is.\n\n1:12:39.500 --> 1:12:40.500\n Right?\n\n1:12:40.500 --> 1:12:42.380\n And, you know, so in practice you can never do that.\n\n1:12:42.380 --> 1:12:46.020\n You can do experiments over and over again, starting from the same initial conditions\n\n1:12:46.020 --> 1:12:47.860\n for small systems.\n\n1:12:47.860 --> 1:12:51.780\n But once things get to be large, Avogadro's number of particles, right?\n\n1:12:51.780 --> 1:12:54.960\n Bigger than a cell, no chance.\n\n1:12:54.960 --> 1:13:00.780\n We we've talked a little bit about arrow of time last time, but in many worlds that there\n\n1:13:00.780 --> 1:13:07.520\n is a kind of implied arrow of time, right?\n\n1:13:07.520 --> 1:13:14.480\n So you've talked about the arrow of time that has to do with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\n1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:18.340\n That's the arrow of time that's emergent or fundamental.\n\n1:13:18.340 --> 1:13:19.340\n We don't know, I guess.\n\n1:13:19.340 --> 1:13:20.340\n No, it's emergent.\n\n1:13:20.340 --> 1:13:23.340\n Is that, does everyone agree on that?\n\n1:13:23.340 --> 1:13:25.380\n Well, nobody agrees with everything.\n\n1:13:25.380 --> 1:13:26.380\n They should.\n\n1:13:26.380 --> 1:13:28.300\n They should.\n\n1:13:28.300 --> 1:13:34.000\n So that arrow of time, is that different than the arrow of time that's implied by many worlds?\n\n1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:35.420\n It's not different, actually, no.\n\n1:13:35.420 --> 1:13:40.940\n In both cases, you have fundamental laws of physics that are completely reversible.\n\n1:13:40.940 --> 1:13:45.040\n If you give me the state of the universe at one moment in time, I can run the clock forward\n\n1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:46.360\n or backward equally well.\n\n1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:51.360\n There's no arrow of time built into the laws of physics at the most fundamental level.\n\n1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:57.920\n But what we do have are special initial conditions 14 billion years ago near the Big Bang.\n\n1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:03.520\n In thermodynamics, those special initial conditions take the form of things were low entropy and\n\n1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:08.480\n entropy has been increasing ever since, making the universe more disorganized and chaotic\n\n1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:10.540\n and that's the arrow of time.\n\n1:14:10.540 --> 1:14:15.080\n In quantum mechanics, the special initial conditions take the form of there was only\n\n1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:20.140\n one branch of the wave function and the universe has been branching more and more ever since.\n\n1:14:20.140 --> 1:14:28.540\n Okay, so if time is emergent, so it seems like our human cognitive capacity likes to\n\n1:14:28.540 --> 1:14:33.200\n take things that are emergent and assume and feel like they're fundamental.\n\n1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:42.600\n So what, so if time is emergent and locality, like is space emergent?\n\n1:14:42.600 --> 1:14:43.600\n Yes.\n\n1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:44.600\n Okay.\n\n1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:46.820\n But I didn't say time was emergent, I said the arrow of time was emergent.\n\n1:14:46.820 --> 1:14:47.820\n Those are different.\n\n1:14:47.820 --> 1:14:52.560\n What's the difference between the arrow of time and time?\n\n1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:56.920\n Are you using arrow of time to simply mean this, they're synonymous with the second law\n\n1:14:56.920 --> 1:14:57.920\n of thermodynamics?\n\n1:14:57.920 --> 1:15:01.520\n No, but the arrow of time is the difference between the past and future.\n\n1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:04.500\n So there's space, but there's no arrow of space.\n\n1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:06.920\n You don't feel that space has to have an arrow, right?\n\n1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:10.700\n You could live in thermodynamic equilibrium, there'd be no arrow of time, but there'd still\n\n1:15:10.700 --> 1:15:11.700\n be time.\n\n1:15:11.700 --> 1:15:14.740\n There'd still be a difference between now and the future or whatever.\n\n1:15:14.740 --> 1:15:19.000\n So if nothing changes, there's still time.\n\n1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:23.760\n Well things could even change, like if the whole universe consisted of the earth going\n\n1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:29.440\n around the sun, it would just go in circles or ellipses, right?\n\n1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:32.560\n Things would change, but it's not increasing entropy, there's no arrow.\n\n1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:38.900\n If you took a movie of that and I played you the movie backward, you would never know.\n\n1:15:38.900 --> 1:15:45.680\n So the arrow of time can theoretically point in the other direction for briefly.\n\n1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:49.000\n To the extent that it points in different directions, it's not a very good arrow.\n\n1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:53.520\n I mean, the arrow of time in the macroscopic world is so powerful that there's just no\n\n1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:55.000\n chance of going back.\n\n1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:58.680\n When you get down to tiny systems with only three or four moving parts, then entropy can\n\n1:15:58.680 --> 1:16:00.480\n fluctuate up and down.\n\n1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:03.440\n What does it mean for space to be an emergent phenomenon?\n\n1:16:03.440 --> 1:16:07.280\n It means that the fundamental description of the world does not include the word space.\n\n1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:10.920\n It'll be something like a vector in Hilbert space, right, and you have to say, well why\n\n1:16:10.920 --> 1:16:16.380\n is there a good approximate description which involves three dimensional space and stuff\n\n1:16:16.380 --> 1:16:17.380\n inside it?\n\n1:16:17.380 --> 1:16:21.200\n Okay, so time and space are emergent.\n\n1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:28.620\n We kind of mentioned in the beginning, can you elaborate, what do you feel hope is fundamental\n\n1:16:28.620 --> 1:16:30.400\n in our universe?\n\n1:16:30.400 --> 1:16:32.160\n A wave function living in Hilbert space.\n\n1:16:32.160 --> 1:16:36.960\n A wave function in Hilbert space that we can't intellectualize or visualize really.\n\n1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:40.160\n We can't visualize it, we can intellectualize it very easily.\n\n1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:42.240\n Like how do you think about?\n\n1:16:42.240 --> 1:16:45.560\n It's a vector in a 10 to the 10 to the 122 dimensional vector space.\n\n1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:50.920\n It's a complex vector, unit norm, it evolves according to the Schrodinger equation.\n\n1:16:50.920 --> 1:16:52.420\n Got it.\n\n1:16:52.420 --> 1:16:53.880\n When you put it that way.\n\n1:16:53.880 --> 1:16:56.880\n What's so hard, really?\n\n1:16:56.880 --> 1:17:04.440\n It's like, yep, quantum computers, there's some excitement, actually a lot of excitement\n\n1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:10.640\n with people that it will allow us to simulate quantum mechanical systems.\n\n1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:14.680\n What kind of questions do you about quantum mechanics, about the things we've been talking\n\n1:17:14.680 --> 1:17:21.720\n about, do you think, do you hope we can answer through quantum simulation?\n\n1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:26.340\n Well I think that there are, there's a whole fascinating frontier of things you can do\n\n1:17:26.340 --> 1:17:27.640\n with quantum computers.\n\n1:17:27.640 --> 1:17:37.400\n Both sort of practical things with cryptography or money, privacy eavesdropping, sorting things,\n\n1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:40.280\n simulating quantum systems, right?\n\n1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:44.800\n So it's a broader question maybe even outside of quantum computers.\n\n1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:49.960\n Some of the theories that we've been talking about, what's your hope, what's most promising\n\n1:17:49.960 --> 1:17:52.160\n to test these theories?\n\n1:17:52.160 --> 1:17:57.620\n What are kind of experiments we can conduct, whether in simulation or in the physical world\n\n1:17:57.620 --> 1:18:03.160\n that would validate or disprove or expand these theories?\n\n1:18:03.160 --> 1:18:06.840\n Well I think for, there's two parts of that question.\n\n1:18:06.840 --> 1:18:10.300\n One is many worlds and the other one is sort of emergent space time.\n\n1:18:10.300 --> 1:18:14.280\n For many worlds, you know, there are experiments ongoing to test whether or not wave functions\n\n1:18:14.280 --> 1:18:17.480\n spontaneously collapse.\n\n1:18:17.480 --> 1:18:21.660\n And if they do, then that rules out many worlds and that would be falsified.\n\n1:18:21.660 --> 1:18:27.400\n If there are hidden variables, there's a theorem that seems to indicate that the predictions\n\n1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:29.800\n will always be the same as many worlds.\n\n1:18:29.800 --> 1:18:31.240\n I'm a little skeptical of this theorem.\n\n1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:32.240\n I'm not complete.\n\n1:18:32.240 --> 1:18:33.240\n I haven't internalized it.\n\n1:18:33.240 --> 1:18:36.680\n I haven't made it in part of my intuitive view of the world yet, so there might be loopholes\n\n1:18:36.680 --> 1:18:37.680\n to that theorem.\n\n1:18:37.680 --> 1:18:38.680\n I'm not sure about that.\n\n1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:42.080\n Part of me thinks that there should be different experimental predictions if there are hidden\n\n1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:45.180\n variables, but I'm not sure.\n\n1:18:45.180 --> 1:18:47.320\n But otherwise, it's just quantum mechanics all the way down.\n\n1:18:47.320 --> 1:18:53.120\n And so there's this cottage industry in science journalism of writing breathless articles\n\n1:18:53.120 --> 1:18:57.840\n that say, you know, quantum mechanics shown to be more astonishing than ever before thought.\n\n1:18:57.840 --> 1:19:01.840\n And really, it's the same quantum mechanics we've been doing since 1926.\n\n1:19:01.840 --> 1:19:06.000\n Whereas with the emergent space time stuff, we know a lot less about what the theory is.\n\n1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:07.760\n It's in a very primitive state.\n\n1:19:07.760 --> 1:19:13.880\n We don't even really have a safely written down, respectable, honest theory yet.\n\n1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:17.460\n So there could very well be experimental predictions we just don't know about yet.\n\n1:19:17.460 --> 1:19:20.200\n That is one of the things that we're trying to figure out.\n\n1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:24.320\n Yeah, for emergent space time, you need really big stuff, right?\n\n1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:27.800\n Well, or really fast stuff, or really energetic stuff.\n\n1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:28.800\n We don't know.\n\n1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:29.800\n That's the thing.\n\n1:19:29.800 --> 1:19:34.440\n You know, so there could be violations of the speed of light if you have emergent space\n\n1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:35.860\n time.\n\n1:19:35.860 --> 1:19:39.240\n Not going faster than the speed of light, but the speed of light could be different\n\n1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:42.320\n for light of different wavelengths, right?\n\n1:19:42.320 --> 1:19:46.840\n That would be a dramatic violation of physics as we know it, but it could be possible.\n\n1:19:46.840 --> 1:19:47.840\n Or not.\n\n1:19:47.840 --> 1:19:48.840\n I mean, it's not an absolute prediction.\n\n1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:49.840\n That's the problem.\n\n1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:54.080\n The theories are just not well developed enough yet to say.\n\n1:19:54.080 --> 1:20:01.120\n Is there anything that quantum mechanics can teach us about human nature or the human mind?\n\n1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:06.820\n If you think about sort of consciousness and these kinds of topics, is there...\n\n1:20:06.820 --> 1:20:10.320\n It's certainly excessively used, as you point out.\n\n1:20:10.320 --> 1:20:15.520\n The word quantum is used for everything besides quantum mechanics.\n\n1:20:15.520 --> 1:20:23.600\n But in more seriousness, is there something that goes to the human level and can help\n\n1:20:23.600 --> 1:20:27.280\n us understand our mind?\n\n1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:29.680\n Not really is the short answer, you know.\n\n1:20:29.680 --> 1:20:31.400\n Minds are pretty classical.\n\n1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:32.920\n I don't think.\n\n1:20:32.920 --> 1:20:36.600\n We don't know this for sure, but I don't think that phenomena like entanglement are crucial\n\n1:20:36.600 --> 1:20:38.440\n to how the human mind works.\n\n1:20:38.440 --> 1:20:40.160\n What about consciousness?\n\n1:20:40.160 --> 1:20:48.920\n So you mentioned, I think early on in the conversation, you said it would be unlikely,\n\n1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:54.680\n but incredible if sort of the observer is somehow a fundamental part.\n\n1:20:54.680 --> 1:21:01.900\n So observer, not to romanticize the notion, but seems interlinked to the idea of consciousness.\n\n1:21:01.900 --> 1:21:09.040\n So if consciousness, as the panpsychists believe, is fundamental to the universe, is that possible?\n\n1:21:09.040 --> 1:21:10.040\n Is that weight...\n\n1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:11.040\n I mean, every...\n\n1:21:11.040 --> 1:21:12.040\n Everything's possible.\n\n1:21:12.040 --> 1:21:16.920\n Just like Joe Rogan likes to say, it's entirely possible.\n\n1:21:16.920 --> 1:21:17.920\n But okay.\n\n1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:22.960\n But is it on a spectrum of crazy out there?\n\n1:21:22.960 --> 1:21:28.600\n How the statistically speaking, how often do you ponder the possibility that consciousness\n\n1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:32.120\n is fundamental or the observer is fundamental to...\n\n1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:33.120\n Personally don't at all.\n\n1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:34.120\n There are people who do.\n\n1:21:34.120 --> 1:21:37.160\n I'm a thorough physicalist when it comes to consciousness.\n\n1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:41.800\n I do not think that there are any separate mental states or mental properties.\n\n1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:46.000\n I think they're all emergent, just like space time is and space time is hard enough to understand.\n\n1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:51.320\n So the fact that we don't yet understand consciousness is not at all surprising to me.\n\n1:21:51.320 --> 1:21:55.280\n You, as we mentioned, have an amazing podcast called Mindscape.\n\n1:21:55.280 --> 1:22:03.680\n It's as I said, one of my favorite podcasts sort of both for your explanation of physics,\n\n1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:10.520\n which a lot of people love, and when you venture out into things that are beyond your expertise,\n\n1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:18.960\n but it's just a really smart person exploring even questions like morality, for example.\n\n1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:19.960\n It's very interesting.\n\n1:22:19.960 --> 1:22:21.920\n I think you did a solo episode and so on.\n\n1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:28.200\n I mean, there's a lot of really interesting conversations that you have.\n\n1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:34.680\n What are some from memory, amazing conversations that pop to mind that you've had?\n\n1:22:34.680 --> 1:22:36.320\n What did you learn from them?\n\n1:22:36.320 --> 1:22:40.360\n Something that maybe changed your mind or just inspired you or just what did this whole\n\n1:22:40.360 --> 1:22:45.160\n experience of having conversations, what stands out to you?\n\n1:22:45.160 --> 1:22:46.160\n It's an unfair question.\n\n1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:47.160\n Totally unfair.\n\n1:22:47.160 --> 1:22:48.160\n That's okay.\n\n1:22:48.160 --> 1:22:49.160\n That's all right.\n\n1:22:49.160 --> 1:22:54.000\n You know, it's often the ones I feel like the ones I do on physics and closely related\n\n1:22:54.000 --> 1:23:01.160\n science or even philosophy ones are like, I know this stuff and I'm helping people learn\n\n1:23:01.160 --> 1:23:02.160\n about it.\n\n1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:05.900\n But I learn more from the ones that have nothing to do with physics or philosophy, right?\n\n1:23:05.900 --> 1:23:12.160\n So talking to Wynton Marsalis about jazz or talking to a Master Sommelier about wine,\n\n1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:18.760\n talking to Will Wilkinson about partisan polarization and the urban rural divide, talking to psychologists\n\n1:23:18.760 --> 1:23:26.320\n like Carol Tavris about cognitive dissonance and how those things work.\n\n1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:31.160\n Scott Derrickson who is the director of the movie Dr. Strange, I had a wonderful conversation\n\n1:23:31.160 --> 1:23:36.680\n with him where we went through the mechanics of making a blockbuster superhero movie, right?\n\n1:23:36.680 --> 1:23:41.440\n And he's also not a naturalist, he's an evangelical Christian so we talked about the nature of\n\n1:23:41.440 --> 1:23:42.440\n reality there.\n\n1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:51.360\n I want to have a couple more, you know, discussions with highly educated theists who know the\n\n1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:56.600\n theology really well but I haven't quite arranged those yet.\n\n1:23:56.600 --> 1:23:57.600\n I would love to hear that.\n\n1:23:57.600 --> 1:24:02.520\n I mean that's, how comfortable are you venturing into questions of religion?\n\n1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:04.960\n Oh, I'm totally comfortable doing it.\n\n1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:10.320\n You know, I did talk with Alan Lightman who is also an atheist but he, you know, he is\n\n1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:18.600\n trying to rescue the sort of spiritual side of things for atheism and I did talk to very\n\n1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:23.280\n vocal atheists like Alex Rosenberg so I need to talk to some, I've talked to some religious\n\n1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:26.360\n believers but I need to talk to more.\n\n1:24:26.360 --> 1:24:31.320\n How have you changed through having all these conversations?\n\n1:24:31.320 --> 1:24:35.360\n You know, part of the motivation was I had a long stack of books that I hadn't read and\n\n1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:38.880\n I couldn't find time to read them and I figured if I interviewed their authors, forced me\n\n1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:42.080\n to read them, right, and that has totally worked by the way.\n\n1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:45.680\n Now I'm annoyed that people write such long books.\n\n1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:49.360\n I think I'm still very much learning how to be a good interviewer.\n\n1:24:49.360 --> 1:24:54.520\n I think that's a skill that, you know, I think I have good questions but, you know, there's\n\n1:24:54.520 --> 1:24:58.920\n the give and take that is still I think I can be better at.\n\n1:24:58.920 --> 1:25:02.480\n Like I want to offer something to the conversation but not too much, right?\n\n1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:06.000\n I've had conversations where I barely talked at all and I have conversations where I talked\n\n1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:09.000\n half the time and I think there's a happy medium in between there.\n\n1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:13.720\n So I think I remember listening to, without mentioning names, some of your conversations\n\n1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:16.480\n where I wish you would have disagreed more.\n\n1:25:16.480 --> 1:25:20.400\n As a listener, it's more fun sometimes.\n\n1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:24.960\n Well, that's a very good question because, you know, everyone has an attitude toward\n\n1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:25.960\n that.\n\n1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:32.720\n Like some people are really there to basically give their point of view and their guest is\n\n1:25:32.720 --> 1:25:35.480\n supposed to, you know, respond accordingly.\n\n1:25:35.480 --> 1:25:41.400\n I want to sort of get my view on the record but I don't want to dwell on it when I'm talking\n\n1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:44.120\n to someone like David Chalmers who I disagree with a lot.\n\n1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:48.860\n You know, I want to say like, here's why I disagree with you but, you know, we're here\n\n1:25:48.860 --> 1:25:49.980\n to listen to you.\n\n1:25:49.980 --> 1:25:53.240\n Like I have an episode every week and you're only on once a week, right?\n\n1:25:53.240 --> 1:26:00.760\n So I have an upcoming podcast episode with Philip Goff who is a much more dedicated pan\n\n1:26:00.760 --> 1:26:02.640\n psychist and so there we really get into it.\n\n1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:06.680\n I think that I probably have disagreed with him more on that episode than I ever have\n\n1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:10.240\n with another podcast guest but that's what he wanted so it worked very well.\n\n1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:11.240\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:26:11.240 --> 1:26:15.880\n That kind of debate structure is beautiful when it's done right.\n\n1:26:15.880 --> 1:26:21.400\n Like when you're, when you can detect that the intent is that you have fundamental respect\n\n1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:22.400\n for the person.\n\n1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:23.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:23.400 --> 1:26:29.040\n That, and that's, for some reason, it's super fun to listen to when two really smart people\n\n1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:32.920\n are just arguing and sometimes lose their shit a little bit if I may say so.\n\n1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:39.160\n Well, there's a fine line because I have zero interest in bringing, I mean, like, I mean,\n\n1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:43.280\n maybe you implied this, I have zero interest in bringing on people for whom I don't have\n\n1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:44.600\n any intellectual respect.\n\n1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:49.120\n Like I constantly get requests like, you know, bring on a flat earther or whatever and really\n\n1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:52.800\n slap them down or a creationist, like I have zero interest.\n\n1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:56.800\n I'm happy to bring on, you know, a religious person, a believer, but I want someone who's\n\n1:26:56.800 --> 1:27:02.160\n smart and can act in good faith and can talk, not a charlatan or a lunatic, right?\n\n1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:08.160\n So I will only, I will happily bring on people with whom I disagree, but only people from\n\n1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:10.320\n whom I think the audience can learn something interesting.\n\n1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:15.740\n So let me ask, the idea of charlatan is an interesting idea.\n\n1:27:15.740 --> 1:27:22.920\n You might be more educated on this topic than me, but there's, there's folks, for example,\n\n1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:31.280\n who argue various aspects of evolution sort of try to approach and say that evolution\n\n1:27:31.280 --> 1:27:37.440\n sort of our current theory of evolution has many holes in it, has many flaws.\n\n1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:46.820\n And they argue that I think like Cambridge, Cambrian explosion, which is like a huge added\n\n1:27:46.820 --> 1:27:52.160\n variability of species, doesn't make sense under our current description of evolution\n\n1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:57.520\n and theory of evolution sort of, if you had to, were to have the conversation with people\n\n1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:05.720\n like that, how do you know that they're the difference in outside the box thinkers and\n\n1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:13.080\n people who are fundamentally unscientific and even bordering on charlatans?\n\n1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:15.080\n That's a great question.\n\n1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:19.200\n And you know, the further you get away from my expertise, the harder it is for me to really\n\n1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:21.040\n judge exactly those things.\n\n1:28:21.040 --> 1:28:25.520\n And, you know, yeah, I don't have a satisfying answer for that one because I think the example\n\n1:28:25.520 --> 1:28:30.840\n you use of someone who, you know, believes in the basic structure of natural selection,\n\n1:28:30.840 --> 1:28:35.240\n but thinks that, you know, this particular thing cannot be understood in the terms of\n\n1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:38.360\n our current understanding of Darwinism.\n\n1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:41.560\n That's a perfect edge case where it's hard to tell, right?\n\n1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:45.680\n And I would have, I would try to talk to people who I do respect and who do know things and\n\n1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:50.920\n I would have to, you know, given that I'm a physicist, I know that physicists will sometimes\n\n1:28:50.920 --> 1:28:53.480\n be too dismissive of alternative points of view.\n\n1:28:53.480 --> 1:28:57.320\n I have to take into account that biologists can also be too dismissive of alternative points\n\n1:28:57.320 --> 1:28:58.320\n of view.\n\n1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:00.760\n So, yeah, that's a tricky one.\n\n1:29:00.760 --> 1:29:02.040\n Have you gotten heat yet?\n\n1:29:02.040 --> 1:29:03.040\n I get heat all the time.\n\n1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:09.000\n Like there's always something, I mean, it's hilarious because I do have, I try very hard\n\n1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:12.080\n not to like have the same topic several times in a row.\n\n1:29:12.080 --> 1:29:16.320\n I did have like two climate change episodes, but they were from very different perspectives,\n\n1:29:16.320 --> 1:29:17.320\n but I like to mix it up.\n\n1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:19.040\n That's the whole, that's why I'm having fun.\n\n1:29:19.040 --> 1:29:22.720\n And every time I do an episode, someone says, oh, the person you should really get on to\n\n1:29:22.720 --> 1:29:24.600\n talk about exactly that is this other person.\n\n1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:26.080\n I'm like, well, I don't, but I did that now.\n\n1:29:26.080 --> 1:29:28.080\n I don't want to do that anymore.\n\n1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:30.880\n Well, I hope you keep doing it.\n\n1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:34.240\n You're inspiring millions of people, your books, your podcasts.\n\n1:29:34.240 --> 1:29:36.240\n Sean, it's an honor to talk to you.\n\n1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:37.240\n Thank you so much.\n\n1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:57.680\n Thank you very much, Lex.\n\n"
