  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:02.800\n The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram,\n\n00:02.800 --> 00:05.080\n his second time on the podcast.\n\n00:05.080 --> 00:07.240\n He's a computer scientist, mathematician,\n\n00:07.240 --> 00:10.640\n theoretical physicist, and the founder and CEO\n\n00:10.640 --> 00:14.400\n of Wolfram Research, a company behind Mathematica,\n\n00:14.400 --> 00:16.680\n Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language,\n\n00:16.680 --> 00:19.200\n and the new Wolfram Physics Project.\n\n00:19.200 --> 00:21.240\n He's the author of several books,\n\n00:21.240 --> 00:24.600\n including A New Kind of Science, and the new book,\n\n00:24.600 --> 00:28.280\n A Project to Find the Fundamental Theory of Physics.\n\n00:28.280 --> 00:30.920\n This second round of our conversation is primarily focused\n\n00:30.920 --> 00:33.880\n on this latter endeavor of searching for the physics\n\n00:33.880 --> 00:37.200\n of our universe in simple rules that do their work\n\n00:37.200 --> 00:40.920\n on hypergraphs and eventually generate the infrastructure\n\n00:40.920 --> 00:45.420\n from which space, time, and all of modern physics can emerge.\n\n00:45.420 --> 00:47.200\n Quick summary of the sponsors,\n\n00:47.200 --> 00:50.240\n SimpliSafe, Sunbasket, and Masterclass.\n\n00:50.240 --> 00:52.880\n Please check out these sponsors in the description\n\n00:52.880 --> 00:55.960\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n00:55.960 --> 00:58.680\n As a side note, let me say that to me,\n\n00:58.680 --> 01:02.040\n the idea that seemingly infinite complexity can arise\n\n01:02.040 --> 01:05.080\n from very simple rules and initial conditions\n\n01:05.080 --> 01:07.720\n is one of the most beautiful and important\n\n01:07.720 --> 01:10.440\n mathematical and philosophical mysteries in science.\n\n01:10.440 --> 01:12.400\n I find that both cellular automata\n\n01:12.400 --> 01:14.920\n and the hypergraph data structure\n\n01:14.920 --> 01:17.360\n that Stephen and team are currently working on\n\n01:17.360 --> 01:21.080\n to be the kind of simple, clear mathematical playground\n\n01:21.080 --> 01:24.560\n within which fundamental ideas about intelligence,\n\n01:24.560 --> 01:28.400\n consciousness, and the fundamental laws of physics\n\n01:28.400 --> 01:31.680\n can be further developed in totally new ways.\n\n01:31.680 --> 01:34.320\n In fact, I think I'll try to make a video or two\n\n01:34.320 --> 01:37.480\n about the most beautiful aspects of these models\n\n01:37.480 --> 01:40.200\n in the coming weeks, especially, I think,\n\n01:40.200 --> 01:43.320\n trying to describe how fellow curious minds like myself\n\n01:43.320 --> 01:47.440\n can jump in and explore them either just for fun\n\n01:47.440 --> 01:51.700\n or potentially for publication of new innovative research\n\n01:51.700 --> 01:54.080\n in math, computer science, and physics.\n\n01:54.080 --> 01:56.320\n But honestly, I think the emerging complexity\n\n01:56.320 --> 01:58.920\n in these hypergraphs can capture the imagination\n\n01:58.920 --> 02:00.880\n of everyone, even if you're someone\n\n02:00.880 --> 02:04.040\n who never really connected with mathematics.\n\n02:04.040 --> 02:06.780\n That's my hope, at least, to have these conversations\n\n02:06.780 --> 02:09.840\n that inspire everyone to look up to the skies\n\n02:09.840 --> 02:14.840\n and into our own minds in awe of our amazing universe.\n\n02:15.080 --> 02:17.840\n Let me also mention that this is the first time\n\n02:17.840 --> 02:20.360\n I ever recorded a podcast outdoors\n\n02:20.360 --> 02:23.520\n as a kind of experiment to see if this is an option\n\n02:23.520 --> 02:25.360\n in times of COVID.\n\n02:25.360 --> 02:27.840\n I'm sorry if the audio is not great.\n\n02:27.840 --> 02:30.580\n I did my best and promise to keep improving\n\n02:30.580 --> 02:32.640\n and learning as always.\n\n02:32.640 --> 02:35.040\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n02:35.040 --> 02:37.200\n review it with Five Stars and Apple Podcast,\n\n02:37.200 --> 02:39.880\n follow on Spotify, support on Patreon,\n\n02:39.880 --> 02:42.880\n or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.\n\n02:42.880 --> 02:44.960\n As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now\n\n02:44.960 --> 02:46.920\n and no ads in the middle.\n\n02:46.920 --> 02:48.440\n I tried to make these interesting,\n\n02:48.440 --> 02:52.240\n but I do give you timestamps, so you're welcome to skip,\n\n02:52.240 --> 02:54.360\n but still, please do check out the sponsors\n\n02:54.360 --> 02:56.600\n by clicking the links in the description.\n\n02:56.600 --> 02:59.560\n It's the best way to support this podcast.\n\n02:59.560 --> 03:02.800\n Also, let me say, even though I'm talking way too much,\n\n03:02.800 --> 03:06.580\n that I did a survey and it seems like over 90% of people\n\n03:06.580 --> 03:09.880\n either enjoy these ad reads somehow magically\n\n03:09.880 --> 03:11.800\n or don't mind them, at least.\n\n03:11.800 --> 03:14.320\n That honestly just warms my heart\n\n03:14.320 --> 03:16.160\n that people are that supportive.\n\n03:16.160 --> 03:18.580\n This show is sponsored by SimpliSafe,\n\n03:18.580 --> 03:20.280\n a home security company.\n\n03:20.280 --> 03:23.800\n Go to SimpliSafe.com to get a free HD camera.\n\n03:23.800 --> 03:28.120\n It's simple, no contracts, 15 bucks a month, easy setup.\n\n03:28.120 --> 03:29.600\n Even I figured it out.\n\n03:29.600 --> 03:31.600\n I have it set up in my apartment.\n\n03:31.600 --> 03:34.280\n Of course, I also welcome intruders.\n\n03:34.280 --> 03:38.300\n One of my favorite movies is Leon or The Professional\n\n03:38.300 --> 03:40.580\n with Jean Reno, Gary Oldman,\n\n03:40.580 --> 03:43.380\n and the brilliant young Natalie Portman.\n\n03:43.380 --> 03:44.280\n If you haven't seen the movie,\n\n03:44.280 --> 03:48.800\n he's a hit man with a minimalist life that resembles my own.\n\n03:48.800 --> 03:52.600\n In fact, when I was younger, the idea of being a hit man\n\n03:52.600 --> 03:56.420\n or targeting evil in a skilled way,\n\n03:56.420 --> 03:59.640\n which is how I thought about it, really appealed to me.\n\n03:59.640 --> 04:02.860\n The skill of it, the planning, the craftsmanship.\n\n04:03.720 --> 04:05.280\n In another life, perhaps,\n\n04:05.280 --> 04:07.840\n if I didn't love engineering and science so much,\n\n04:07.840 --> 04:10.760\n I could see myself being something like a Navy SEAL.\n\n04:10.760 --> 04:14.080\n And in general, I love the idea of serving my country,\n\n04:14.080 --> 04:16.700\n of serving society by contributing my skill\n\n04:16.700 --> 04:18.500\n in some small way.\n\n04:18.500 --> 04:21.240\n Anyway, go to Simplisafe.com slash Lex\n\n04:21.240 --> 04:24.340\n to get a free HD camera and to support this podcast.\n\n04:24.340 --> 04:27.280\n They're a new sponsor, and this is a trial run,\n\n04:27.280 --> 04:28.960\n so you know what to do.\n\n04:28.960 --> 04:31.600\n This show is also sponsored by Sun Basket,\n\n04:31.600 --> 04:33.200\n a meal delivery service.\n\n04:33.200 --> 04:35.240\n Visit SunBasket.com slash Lex\n\n04:35.240 --> 04:38.580\n and use code LEX to get $30 off your

them if you're considering it.\n\n04:46.220 --> 04:48.220\n And if you do, it'll help ensure\n\n04:48.220 --> 04:51.800\n that they decide to support this podcast long term.\n\n04:51.800 --> 04:54.400\n Their meals are healthy and delicious,\n\n04:54.400 --> 04:56.960\n a nice break from the minimalist meals of meat\n\n04:56.960 --> 04:59.640\n and vegetables that I usually eat.\n\n04:59.640 --> 05:00.840\n Maybe on a personal note,\n\n05:00.840 --> 05:03.720\n one of my favorite things to do is watch people cook,\n\n05:03.720 --> 05:05.800\n especially people who love cooking,\n\n05:05.800 --> 05:09.080\n and hang out with people over amazing meals.\n\n05:09.080 --> 05:11.640\n I still tend to be strict in my diet no matter what,\n\n05:11.640 --> 05:12.940\n even in fancy restaurants,\n\n05:12.940 --> 05:17.140\n but it brings me joy to see friends and family indulge\n\n05:17.140 --> 05:20.760\n something like a cake that has way too many calories\n\n05:20.760 --> 05:22.640\n or ice cream or whatever.\n\n05:22.640 --> 05:24.920\n My mom, in fact, for much of my life,\n\n05:24.920 --> 05:27.760\n made this cake called an anthill on my birthday\n\n05:27.760 --> 05:32.500\n that brings me a lot of joy and way too many calories.\n\n05:32.500 --> 05:36.480\n I was thinking of doing a video with my mom as she makes it.\n\n05:36.480 --> 05:39.500\n I thought it'd be a fun thing to do together.\n\n05:39.500 --> 05:44.020\n Anyway, go to SunBasket.com slash Lex and use code LEX.\n\n05:44.020 --> 05:45.280\n Do it now.\n\n05:45.280 --> 05:48.200\n So they signed a longterm contract for this podcast.\n\n05:48.200 --> 05:50.680\n This show is also sponsored by Masterclass.\n\n05:50.680 --> 05:53.360\n Sign up at masterclass.com slash LEX.\n\n05:53.360 --> 05:57.180\n 180 bucks a year, you get an all access pass\n\n05:57.180 --> 05:59.680\n to watch lessons from Chris Hadfield,\n\n05:59.680 --> 06:02.100\n Neil deGrasse Tyson, Tony Hawk, Carlos Santana,\n\n06:02.100 --> 06:03.920\n Garrett Casparov, Daniel Nagano,\n\n06:03.920 --> 06:07.220\n and many more brilliant world experts.\n\n06:07.220 --> 06:10.260\n Masterclass has been a really special sponsor.\n\n06:10.260 --> 06:13.280\n They believe in this podcast in a way that gives me strength\n\n06:13.280 --> 06:16.360\n and motivation to take intellectual risks.\n\n06:16.360 --> 06:18.880\n I'm thinking of doing a few solo podcast episodes\n\n06:18.880 --> 06:22.240\n on difficult topics, especially in history,\n\n06:22.240 --> 06:26.520\n like the rise and fall of the Third Reich or Stalin, Putin,\n\n06:26.520 --> 06:29.560\n and many other difficult topics that I'm fascinated by.\n\n06:29.560 --> 06:33.120\n I have a worldview that seeks inspiring positive insights,\n\n06:33.120 --> 06:38.120\n even and perhaps especially from periods of tragedy and evil\n\n06:38.240 --> 06:40.800\n that perhaps some folks may find value in.\n\n06:40.800 --> 06:43.640\n If I can only learn to convey the ideas in my mind\n\n06:43.640 --> 06:45.800\n as clearly as I think them.\n\n06:45.800 --> 06:50.520\n I think deeply and rigorously and precisely,\n\n06:50.520 --> 06:53.520\n but to be honest, have trouble speaking in a way\n\n06:53.520 --> 06:56.800\n that reflects that rigor of thought.\n\n06:56.800 --> 07:00.160\n So it really does mean a lot, the love and support I get\n\n07:00.160 --> 07:02.040\n as I try to get better at this thing,\n\n07:02.040 --> 07:03.880\n at this talking thing.\n\n07:03.880 --> 07:07.400\n Anyway, go to masterclass.com slash LEX to get a discount\n\n07:07.400 --> 07:09.400\n and to support this podcast.\n\n07:09.400 --> 07:13.800\n And now finally, here's my conversation with Stephen Wolfram.\n\n07:14.800 --> 07:17.420\n You said that there are moments in history of physics\n\n07:17.420 --> 07:20.200\n and maybe mathematical physics or even mathematics\n\n07:20.200 --> 07:22.460\n where breakthroughs happen\n\n07:22.460 --> 07:24.800\n and then a flurry of progress follows.\n\n07:24.800 --> 07:28.320\n So if you look back through the history of physics,\n\n07:28.320 --> 07:32.240\n what moments stand out to you as important such breakthroughs\n\n07:32.240 --> 07:34.560\n where a flurry of progress follows?\n\n07:34.560 --> 07:36.880\n So the big famous one was 1920s,\n\n07:36.880 --> 07:38.960\n the invention of quantum mechanics,\n\n07:38.960 --> 07:41.960\n where in about five or 10 years,\n\n07:41.960 --> 07:43.720\n lots of stuff got figured out.\n\n07:43.720 --> 07:45.040\n That's now quantum mechanics.\n\n07:45.040 --> 07:46.600\n Can you mention the people involved?\n\n07:46.600 --> 07:50.640\n Yeah, it was kind of the Schrodinger, Heisenberg,\n\n07:50.640 --> 07:53.900\n Einstein had been a key figure, originally Planck,\n\n07:53.900 --> 07:56.560\n then Dirac was a little bit later.\n\n07:56.560 --> 07:58.160\n That was something that happened at that time,\n\n07:58.160 --> 08:00.440\n that's sort of before my time, right?\n\n08:00.440 --> 08:04.040\n In my time was in the 1970s,\n\n08:04.040 --> 08:06.320\n there was this sort of realization\n\n08:06.320 --> 08:09.080\n that quantum field theory was actually going to be useful\n\n08:09.080 --> 08:13.040\n in physics and QCD, quantum thermodynamics theory\n\n08:13.040 --> 08:16.080\n of quarks and gluons and so on was really getting started.\n\n08:16.080 --> 08:19.800\n And there was again, sort of big flurry of things\n\n08:19.800 --> 08:22.440\n happened then, I happened to be a teenager at that time\n\n08:22.440 --> 08:26.540\n and happened to be really involved in physics.\n\n08:26.540 --> 08:29.760\n And so I got to be part of that, which was really cool.\n\n08:29.760 --> 08:31.100\n Who were the key figures\n\n08:31.100 --> 08:33.880\n aside from your young selves at that time?\n\n08:33.880 --> 08:37.040\n You know, who won the Nobel Prize for QCD, okay?\n\n08:37.040 --> 08:41.440\n People, David Gross, Frank Wilczek, you know, David Politzer.\n\n08:41.440 --> 08:44.000\n The people who are the sort of the slightly older generation,\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:47.080\n Dick Feynman, Murray Gellman, people like that,\n\n08:48.520 --> 08:52.760\n who were Steve Weinberg, Gerhard Hoft, he's younger,\n\n08:52.760 --> 08:54.800\n he's in the younger group actually.\n\n08:54.800 --> 08:59.240\n But these are all, you know, characters who were involved.\n\n08:59.240 --> 09:02.540\n I mean, it's funny because those are all people\n\n09:02.540 --> 09:05.040\n who are kind of in my time and I know them\n\n09:05.040 --> 09:08.820\n and they don't seem like sort of historical,\n\n09:08.820 --> 09:10.140\n you know, iconic figures.\n\n09:10.140 --> 09:14.480\n They seem more like everyday characters, so to speak.\n\n09:14.480 --> 09:18.040\n And so it's always, you know, when you look at history\n\n09:18.040 --> 09:21.480\n from long afterwards, it always seems like\n\n09:21.480 --> 09:23.100\n everything happened instantly.\n\n09:24.120 --> 09:25.680\n And that's usually not the case.\n\n09:25.680 --> 09:27.360\n There was usually a long buildup,\n\n09:27.360 --> 09:28.600\n but usually there's, you know,\n\n09:28.600 --> 09:30.920\n there's some methodological thing happens\n\n09:30.920 --> 09:32.560\n and then there's a whole bunch of low hanging fruit\n\n09:32.560 --> 09:33.800\n to be picked.\n\n09:33.800 --> 09:36.360\n And that usually lasts five or 10 years.\n\n09:36.360 --> 09:38.760\n You know, we see it today with machine learning\n\n09:38.760 --> 09:42.640\n and, you know, deep learning neural nets and so on.\n\n09:42.640 --> 09:44.440\n You know, methodological advance,\n\n09:44.440 --> 09:47.480\n things actually started working in, you know, 2011, 2012\n\n09:47.480 --> 09:48.440\n and so on.\n\n09:48.440 --> 09:51.680\n And, you know, there's been this sort of rapid\n\n09:51.680 --> 09:55.560\n picking of low hanging fruit, which is probably, you know,\n\n09:56.520 --> 10:00.080\n some significant fraction of the way done, so to speak.\n\n10:00.080 --> 10:01.600\n Do you think there's a key moment?\n\n10:01.600 --> 10:03.120\n Like if I had to really introspect,\n\n10:03.120 --> 10:04.680\n like what was the key moment\n\n10:04.680 --> 10:08.040\n for the deep learning, quote unquote, revolution?\n\n10:08.040 --> 10:08.860\n I mean.\n\n10:08.860 --> 10:10.120\n It's probably the AlexNet business.\n\n10:10.120 --> 10:11.480\n AlexNet with ImageNet.\n\n10:11.480 --> 10:13.840\n So is there something like that with physics\n\n10:13.840 --> 10:18.080\n where, so deep learning neural networks\n\n10:18.080 --> 10:19.880\n have been around for a long time.\n\n10:19.880 --> 10:22.000\n Absolutely, since the 1940s, yeah.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:23.960\n There's a bunch of little pieces that came together\n\n10:23.960 --> 10:27.480\n and then all of a sudden everybody's eyes lit up.\n\n10:27.480 --> 10:29.820\n Like, wow, there's something here.\n\n10:29.820 --> 10:32.520\n Like even just looking at your own work,\n\n10:32.520 --> 10:34.360\n just your thinking about the universe,\n\n10:34.360 --> 10:38.900\n that there's simple rules can create complexity.\n\n10:40.120 --> 10:42.880\n You know, at which point was there a thing\n\n10:42.880 --> 10:45.120\n where your eyes light up?\n\n10:45.120 --> 10:46.520\n It's like, wait a minute, there's something here.\n\n10:46.520 --> 10:49.480\n Is it the very first idea\n\n10:49.480 --> 10:53.360\n or is it some moment along the line of implementations\n\n10:53.360 --> 10:54.640\n and experiments and so on?\n\n10:54.640 --> 10:56.380\n There's a couple of different stages to this.\n\n10:56.380 --> 11:01.080\n I mean, one is the think about the world computationally.\n\n11:01.080 --> 11:03.880\n Can we use programs instead of equations\n\n11:03.880 --> 11:05.880\n to make models of the world?\n\n11:05.880 --> 11:07.760\n That's something that I got interested in\n\n11:07.760 --> 11:10.400\n in the beginning of the 1980s.\n\n11:10.400 --> 11:13.040\n I did a bunch of computer experiments.\n\n11:13.040 --> 11:15.820\n When I first did them, I didn't really,\n\n11:15.820 --> 11:17.520\n I could see some significance to them,\n\n11:17.520 --> 11:20.000\n but it took me a few years to really say,\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.880\n wow, there's a big important phenomenon here\n\n11:22.880 --> 11:25.400\n that lets sort of complex things arise\n\n11:25.400 --> 11:27.360\n from very simple programs.\n\n11:27.360 --> 11:30.560\n That kind of happened back in 1984 or so.\n\n11:30.560 --> 11:33.000\n Then, you know, a bunch of other years go by,\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.520\n then I start actually doing a lot\n\n11:35.520 --> 11:37.720\n of much more systematic computer experiments and things\n\n11:37.720 --> 11:39.280\n and find out that the, you know,\n\n11:39.280 --> 11:41.520\n this phenomenon that I could only have said occurs\n\n11:41.520 --> 11:43.040\n in one particular case\n\n11:43.040 --> 11:45.120\n is actually something incredibly general.\n\n11:45.120 --> 11:46.560\n And then that led me to this thing called\n\n11:46.560 --> 11:48.680\n principle of computational equivalence.\n\n11:48.680 --> 11:51.120\n And that was a long story.\n\n11:51.120 --> 11:53.920\n And then, you know, as part of that process,\n\n11:53.920 --> 11:56.880\n I was like, okay, you can make simple programs,\n\n11:56.880 --> 11:59.240\n can make models of complicated things.\n\n11:59.240 --> 12:00.720\n What about the whole universe?\n\n12:00.720 --> 12:03.760\n That's our sort of ultimate example of a complicated thing.\n\n12:03.760 --> 12:05.080\n And so I got to thinking, you know,\n\n12:05.080 --> 12:10.080\n could we use these ideas to study fundamental physics?\n\n12:10.240 --> 12:11.960\n You know, I happen to know a lot about,\n\n12:11.960 --> 12:14.160\n you know, traditional fundamental physics.\n\n12:14.160 --> 12:17.320\n My first, you know, I had a bunch of ideas\n\n12:17.320 --> 12:19.360\n about how to do this in the early 1990s.\n\n12:19.360 --> 12:21.080\n I made a bunch of technical progress.\n\n12:21.080 --> 12:22.120\n I figured out a bunch of things\n\n12:22.120 --> 12:23.880\n I thought were pretty interesting.\n\n12:23.880 --> 12:26.600\n You know, I wrote about them back in 2002.\n\n12:26.600 --> 12:27.800\n With the new kind of science\n\n12:27.800 --> 12:29.200\n in the cellular automata world.\n\n12:29.200 --> 12:32.200\n And there's echoes in the cellular automata world\n\n12:32.200 --> 12:36.680\n with your new Wolfram physics project.\n\n12:36.680 --> 12:37.640\n We'll get to all that.\n\n12:37.640 --> 12:40.280\n Allow me to sort of romanticize a little more\n\n12:40.280 --> 12:41.960\n on the philosophy of science.\n\n12:43.280 --> 12:45.600\n So Thomas Kuhn, philosopher of science,\n\n12:45.600 --> 12:49.440\n describes that, you know, the progress in science\n\n12:49.440 --> 12:52.160\n is made with these paradigm shifts.\n\n12:52.160 --> 12:56.920\n And so to link on the sort of original line of discussion,\n\n12:56.920 --> 12:58.120\n do you agree with this view\n\n12:58.120 --> 13:01.520\n that there is revolutions in science\n\n13:01.520 --> 13:03.400\n that just kind of flip the table?\n\n13:03.400 --> 13:05.920\n What happens is it's a different way\n\n13:05.920 --> 13:07.000\n of thinking about things.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.920\n It's a different methodology for studying things.\n\n13:09.920 --> 13:11.720\n And that opens stuff up.\n\n13:11.720 --> 13:13.240\n There's this idea of,\n\n13:15.400 --> 13:16.840\n he's a famous biographer,\n\n13:16.840 --> 13:19.640\n but I think it's called the innovators.\n\n13:19.640 --> 13:22.680\n There's a biographer of Steve Jobs, of Albert Einstein.\n\n13:22.680 --> 13:23.640\n He also wrote a book,\n\n13:23.640 --> 13:24.800\n I think it's called the innovators,\n\n13:24.800 --> 13:29.800\n where he discusses how a lot of the innovations\n\n13:30.240 --> 13:33.840\n in the history of computing has been done by groups.\n\n13:33.840 --> 13:37.320\n There's a complicated group dynamic going on,\n\n13:37.320 --> 13:39.360\n but there's also a romanticized notion\n\n13:39.360 --> 13:42.800\n that the individual is at the core of the revolution.\n\n13:42.800 --> 13:45.280\n Like where does your sense fall?\n\n13:45.280 --> 13:49.880\n Is ultimately like one person responsible\n\n13:49.880 --> 13:52.680\n for these revolutions that creates the spark\n\n13:52.680 --> 13:54.600\n or one or two, whatever,\n\n13:54.600 --> 13:58.760\n or is it just the big mush and mess and chaos\n\n13:58.760 --> 14:01.360\n of people interacting, of personalities interacting?\n\n14:01.360 --> 14:03.120\n I think it ends up being like many things,\n\n14:03.120 --> 14:05.360\n there's leadership and there ends up being,\n\n14:05.360 --> 14:08.080\n it's a lot easier for one person to have a crisp new idea\n\n14:08.080 --> 14:10.840\n than it is for a big committee to have a crisp new idea.\n\n14:10.840 --> 14:13.720\n And I think, but I think it can happen\n\n14:13.720 --> 14:16.440\n that you have a great idea,\n\n14:16.440 --> 14:19.120\n but the world isn't ready for it.\n\n14:19.120 --> 14:24.040\n And you can, I mean, this has happened to me plenty, right?\n\n14:24.040 --> 14:27.200\n It's, you have an idea, it's actually a pretty good idea,\n\n14:27.200 --> 14:29.240\n but things aren't ready,\n\n14:29.240 --> 14:31.680\n either you're not really ready for it,\n\n14:31.680 --> 14:34.480\n or the ambient world isn't ready for it.\n\n14:34.480 --> 14:37.880\n And it's hard to get the thing to get traction.\n\n14:37.880 --> 14:38.720\n It's kind of interesting.\n\n14:38.720 --> 14:41.720\n I mean, when I look at a new kind of science,\n\n14:41.720 --> 14:43.640\n you're now living inside the history,\n\n14:43.640 --> 14:46.680\n so you can't tell the story of these decades,\n\n14:46.680 --> 14:49.640\n but it seems like the new kind of science\n\n14:49.640 --> 14:54.640\n has not had the revolutionary impact\n\n14:55.200 --> 14:59.120\n I would think it might.\n\n14:59.120 --> 15:02.640\n Like, it feels like at some point, of course it might be,\n\n15:02.640 --> 15:06.240\n but it feels at some point people will return to that book\n\n15:07.120 --> 15:09.600\n and say, that was something special here.\n\n15:09.600 --> 15:10.880\n This was incredible.\n\n15:10.880 --> 15:11.840\n What happened?\n\n15:11.840 --> 15:13.560\n Or do you think that's already happened?\n\n15:13.560 --> 15:16.400\n Oh, yeah, it's happened, except that people aren't,\n\n15:16.400 --> 15:19.480\n the sort of the heroism of it may not be there,\n\n15:19.480 --> 15:22.760\n but what's happened is for 300 years,\n\n15:22.760 --> 15:24.520\n people basically said,\n\n15:24.520 --> 15:27.040\n if you want to make a model of things in the world,\n\n15:27.040 --> 15:29.760\n mathematical equations are the best place to go.\n\n15:29.760 --> 15:32.480\n Last 15 years, doesn't happen.\n\n15:32.480 --> 15:34.600\n New models that get made of things\n\n15:34.600 --> 15:38.600\n most often are made with programs, not with equations.\n\n15:38.600 --> 15:42.320\n Now, was that sort of going to happen anyway?\n\n15:42.320 --> 15:45.600\n Was that a consequence of my particular work\n\n15:45.600 --> 15:47.240\n and my particular book?\n\n15:47.240 --> 15:48.800\n It's hard to know for sure.\n\n15:48.800 --> 15:51.560\n I mean, I am always amazed at the amounts of feedback\n\n15:51.560 --> 15:52.960\n that I get from people where they say,\n\n15:52.960 --> 15:56.080\n oh, by the way, I started doing this whole line of research\n\n15:56.080 --> 15:58.520\n because I read your book, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n15:58.520 --> 15:59.920\n It's like, well, can you tell that\n\n15:59.920 --> 16:01.880\n from the academic literature?\n\n16:01.880 --> 16:04.520\n Was there a chain of academic references?\n\n16:04.520 --> 16:05.800\n Probably not.\n\n16:05.800 --> 16:09.040\n One of the interesting side effects of publishing\n\n16:09.040 --> 16:11.920\n in the way you did this tome\n\n16:11.920 --> 16:15.320\n is it serves as an education tool and an inspiration\n\n16:15.320 --> 16:19.200\n to hundreds of thousands, millions of people,\n\n16:19.200 --> 16:21.680\n but because it's not a single,\n\n16:21.680 --> 16:25.200\n it's not a chain of papers with spiffy titles,\n\n16:25.200 --> 16:29.320\n it doesn't create a splash of citations.\n\n16:29.320 --> 16:31.440\n It's had plenty of citations, but it's, you know,\n\n16:31.440 --> 16:36.440\n I think that people think of it as probably more,\n\n16:36.440 --> 16:41.440\n you know, conceptual inspiration than kind of a,\n\n16:41.640 --> 16:43.880\n you know, this is a line from here to here to here\n\n16:43.880 --> 16:45.440\n in our particular field.\n\n16:45.440 --> 16:49.520\n I think that the thing which I am disappointed by\n\n16:49.520 --> 16:51.440\n and which will eventually happen\n\n16:51.440 --> 16:55.840\n is this kind of study of the sort of pure computationalism,\n\n16:55.840 --> 16:58.600\n this kind of study of the abstract behavior\n\n16:58.600 --> 17:00.520\n of the computational universe.\n\n17:00.520 --> 17:03.960\n That should be a big thing that lots of people do.\n\n17:03.960 --> 17:06.320\n You mean in mathematics purely, almost like.\n\n17:06.320 --> 17:08.840\n It's like pure mathematics, but it isn't mathematics.\n\n17:08.840 --> 17:10.440\n But it isn't, it isn't.\n\n17:10.440 --> 17:12.320\n It's a new kind of mathematics.\n\n17:12.320 --> 17:14.360\n Is it a new title of the book?\n\n17:14.360 --> 17:15.200\n Yeah, right.\n\n17:15.200 --> 17:17.040\n That's why the book is called that.\n\n17:17.040 --> 17:19.160\n Right, that's not coincidental.\n\n17:19.160 --> 17:20.160\n Yeah.\n\n17:20.160 --> 17:22.840\n It's interesting that I haven't seen\n\n17:22.840 --> 17:24.960\n really rigorous investigation\n\n17:24.960 --> 17:26.880\n by thousands of people of this idea.\n\n17:26.880 --> 17:30.080\n I mean, you look at your competition around rule 30.\n\n17:30.080 --> 17:31.320\n I mean, that's fascinating.\n\n17:31.320 --> 17:34.320\n If you can say something.\n\n17:34.320 --> 17:35.160\n Right.\n\n17:35.160 --> 17:38.800\n Is there some aspect of this thing that could be predicted?\n\n17:38.800 --> 17:40.960\n That's the fundamental question of science.\n\n17:40.960 --> 17:41.800\n That's the core.\n\n17:41.800 --> 17:42.880\n Well, that has been a question of science.\n\n17:42.880 --> 17:47.440\n I think that is some people's view of what science is about\n\n17:47.440 --> 17:48.960\n and it's not clear that's the right view.\n\n17:48.960 --> 17:51.520\n In fact, as we live through this pandemic\n\n17:51.520 --> 17:53.320\n full of predictions and so on,\n\n17:53.320 --> 17:55.360\n it's an interesting moment to be pondering\n\n17:55.360 --> 17:58.440\n what science's actual role in those kinds of things is.\n\n17:58.440 --> 18:02.080\n Or you think it's possible that in science,\n\n18:02.080 --> 18:04.920\n clean, beautiful, simple prediction\n\n18:04.920 --> 18:07.240\n may not even be possible in real systems.\n\n18:07.240 --> 18:08.800\n That's the open question.\n\n18:08.800 --> 18:09.640\n I don't think it's open.\n\n18:09.640 --> 18:12.240\n I think that question is answered and the answer is no.\n\n18:12.240 --> 18:13.120\n Well, no, no.\n\n18:13.120 --> 18:16.680\n The answer could be just humans are not smart enough yet.\n\n18:16.680 --> 18:17.520\n Like we don't have the tools yet.\n\n18:17.520 --> 18:18.680\n No, that's the whole point.\n\n18:18.680 --> 18:20.680\n I mean, that's sort of the big discovery\n\n18:20.680 --> 18:23.320\n of this principle of computational equivalence of mine.\n\n18:23.320 --> 18:26.880\n And this is something which is kind of a follow on\n\n18:26.880 --> 18:28.920\n to G\u00f6del's theorem, to Turing's work\n\n18:28.920 --> 18:31.680\n on the halting problem, all these kinds of things.\n\n18:31.680 --> 18:34.720\n That there is this fundamental limitation\n\n18:34.720 --> 18:36.360\n built into science,\n\n18:36.360 --> 18:39.120\n this idea of computational irreducibility\n\n18:39.120 --> 18:42.480\n that says that even though you may know the rules\n\n18:42.480 --> 18:44.160\n by which something operates,\n\n18:44.160 --> 18:47.600\n that does not mean that you can readily sort of\n\n18:47.600 --> 18:49.760\n be smarter than it and jump ahead\n\n18:49.760 --> 18:51.640\n and figure out what it's going to do.\n\n18:51.640 --> 18:53.800\n Yes, but do you think there's a hope\n\n18:53.800 --> 18:56.960\n for pockets of computational reducibility?\n\n18:56.960 --> 19:00.480\n Computational reducibility.\n\n19:02.480 --> 19:04.840\n And then a set of tools and mathematics\n\n19:04.840 --> 19:07.040\n that help you discover such pockets.\n\n19:07.040 --> 19:10.160\n That's where we live is in the pockets of reducibility.\n\n19:10.160 --> 19:12.560\n That's why, and this is one of the things\n\n19:12.560 --> 19:14.080\n that sort of come out of this physics project\n\n19:14.080 --> 19:15.480\n and actually something that, again,\n\n19:15.480 --> 19:18.680\n I should have realized many years ago, but didn't,\n\n19:18.680 --> 19:23.440\n is it could very well be that everything about the world\n\n19:23.440 --> 19:26.560\n is computationally reducible and completely unpredictable.\n\n19:26.560 --> 19:29.720\n But in our experience of the world,\n\n19:29.720 --> 19:32.520\n there is at least some amount of prediction we can make.\n\n19:32.520 --> 19:36.560\n And that's because we have sort of chosen a slice of,\n\n19:36.560 --> 19:38.320\n probably talk about this in much more detail,\n\n19:38.320 --> 19:39.920\n but I mean, we've kind of chosen a slice\n\n19:39.920 --> 19:41.760\n of how to think about the universe\n\n19:41.760 --> 19:43.960\n in which we can kind of sample\n\n19:43.960 --> 19:46.640\n a certain amount of computational reducibility.\n\n19:46.640 --> 19:51.640\n And that's sort of where we exist.\n\n19:51.640 --> 19:55.920\n And it may not be the whole story of how the universe is,\n\n19:55.920 --> 19:59.240\n but it is the part of the universe that we care about\n\n19:59.240 --> 20:01.000\n and we sort of operate in.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.600\n And that's, you know, in science,\n\n20:03.600 --> 20:05.720\n that's been sort of a very special case of that.\n\n20:05.720 --> 20:09.360\n That is science has chosen to talk a lot about places\n\n20:09.360 --> 20:12.120\n where there is this computational reducibility\n\n20:12.120 --> 20:13.640\n that it can find, you know,\n\n20:13.640 --> 20:16.400\n the motion of the planets can be more or less predicted.\n\n20:16.400 --> 20:19.080\n You know, something about the weather\n\n20:19.080 --> 20:20.640\n is much harder to predict.\n\n20:20.640 --> 20:22.760\n Something about, you know, other kinds of things\n\n20:22.760 --> 20:25.160\n that are much harder to predict.\n\n20:25.160 --> 20:29.160\n And it's, these are, but science has tended to,\n\n20:29.160 --> 20:31.040\n you know, concentrate itself on places\n\n20:31.040 --> 20:35.080\n where its methods have allowed successful prediction.\n\n20:35.080 --> 20:38.240\n So you think rule 30, if we could linger on it,\n\n20:39.160 --> 20:41.600\n because it's just such a beautiful, simple formulation\n\n20:41.600 --> 20:43.520\n of the essential concept underlying\n\n20:43.520 --> 20:45.000\n all the things we're talking about.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.240\n Do you think there's pockets of reducibility\n\n20:47.240 --> 20:48.480\n inside rule 30?\n\n20:48.480 --> 20:51.600\n Yes, that is the question of how big are they?\n\n20:51.600 --> 20:53.120\n What will they allow you to say?\n\n20:53.120 --> 20:53.960\n And so on.\n\n20:53.960 --> 20:56.960\n And that's, and figuring out where those pockets are,\n\n20:56.960 --> 20:59.520\n I mean, in a sense, that's the, that's sort of a,\n\n21:00.480 --> 21:02.640\n you know, that is an essential thing\n\n21:02.640 --> 21:05.760\n that one would like to do in science.\n\n21:05.760 --> 21:08.800\n But it's also, the important thing to realize\n\n21:08.800 --> 21:13.760\n that has not been, you know, is that science,\n\n21:13.760 --> 21:15.400\n if you just pick an arbitrary thing,\n\n21:15.400 --> 21:18.120\n you say, what's the answer to this question?\n\n21:18.120 --> 21:20.200\n That question may not be one\n\n21:20.200 --> 21:22.880\n that has a computationally reducible answer.\n\n21:22.880 --> 21:26.360\n That question, if you choose, you know,\n\n21:26.360 --> 21:28.880\n if you walk along the series of questions\n\n21:28.880 --> 21:30.280\n and you've got one that's reducible\n\n21:30.280 --> 21:31.680\n and you get to another one that's nearby\n\n21:31.680 --> 21:33.000\n and it's reducible too,\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:36.080\n if you stick to that kind of stick to the land,\n\n21:36.080 --> 21:39.640\n so to speak, then you can go down this chain\n\n21:39.640 --> 21:41.960\n of sort of reducible, answerable things.\n\n21:41.960 --> 21:44.440\n But if you just say, I'm just pick a question at random,\n\n21:44.440 --> 21:47.400\n I'm gonna have my computer pick a question at random.\n\n21:47.400 --> 21:49.280\n Most likely it's gonna be reducible.\n\n21:49.280 --> 21:50.960\n Most likely it will be reducible.\n\n21:50.960 --> 21:54.720\n And what we're thrown in the world, so to speak,\n\n21:54.720 --> 21:56.440\n we, you know, when we engineer things,\n\n21:56.440 --> 21:58.320\n we tend to engineer things to sort of keep\n\n21:58.320 --> 22:00.280\n in the zone of reducibility.\n\n22:00.280 --> 22:02.280\n When we're throwing things by the natural world,\n\n22:02.280 --> 22:05.520\n for example, not at all certain\n\n22:05.520 --> 22:08.680\n that we will be kept in this kind of zone of reducibility.\n\n22:08.680 --> 22:11.240\n Can we talk about this pandemic then?\n\n22:11.240 --> 22:12.080\n Sure.\n\n22:12.080 --> 22:16.000\n For a second, is a, so how do we,\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.920\n there's obviously huge amount of economic pain\n\n22:18.920 --> 22:19.800\n that people are feeling.\n\n22:19.800 --> 22:23.960\n There's a huge incentive and medical pain,\n\n22:23.960 --> 22:26.760\n health, just all kind of psychological.\n\n22:26.760 --> 22:28.760\n There's a huge incentive to figure this out,\n\n22:28.760 --> 22:33.320\n to walk along the trajectory of reducible, of reducibility.\n\n22:34.440 --> 22:38.040\n There's a lot of disparate data.\n\n22:38.040 --> 22:40.520\n You know, people understand generally how viruses spread,\n\n22:40.520 --> 22:43.240\n but it's very complicated\n\n22:43.240 --> 22:45.320\n because there's a lot of uncertainty.\n\n22:45.320 --> 22:49.320\n There's a, there could be a lot of variability also,\n\n22:49.320 --> 22:52.920\n like so many, obviously a nearly infinite number\n\n22:52.920 --> 22:57.920\n of variables that represent human interaction.\n\n22:57.920 --> 22:59.920\n And so you have to figure out,\n\n22:59.920 --> 23:02.680\n from the perspective of reducibility,\n\n23:02.680 --> 23:06.600\n figure out which variables are really important\n\n23:06.600 --> 23:10.600\n in this kind of, from an epidemiological perspective.\n\n23:10.600 --> 23:13.800\n So why aren't we, you kind of said\n\n23:13.800 --> 23:15.960\n that we're clearly failing.\n\n23:15.960 --> 23:17.320\n Well, I think it's a complicated thing.\n\n23:17.320 --> 23:20.200\n So, I mean, you know, when this pandemic started up,\n\n23:20.200 --> 23:21.800\n you know, I happened to be in the middle\n\n23:21.800 --> 23:24.800\n of being about to release this whole physics project thing,\n\n23:24.800 --> 23:25.640\n but I thought, you know.\n\n23:25.640 --> 23:28.280\n The timing is just cosmically absurd.\n\n23:28.280 --> 23:30.440\n A little bit bizarre, but you know,\n\n23:30.440 --> 23:31.360\n but I thought, you know,\n\n23:31.360 --> 23:33.960\n I should do the public service thing of, you know,\n\n23:33.960 --> 23:36.000\n trying to understand what I could about the pandemic.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.160\n And, you know, we'd been curating data about it\n\n23:38.160 --> 23:39.280\n and all that kind of thing.\n\n23:39.280 --> 23:41.680\n But, you know, so I started looking at the data\n\n23:41.680 --> 23:43.600\n and started looking at modeling\n\n23:43.600 --> 23:46.000\n and I decided it's just really hard.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.240\n You need to know a lot of stuff that we don't know\n\n23:48.240 --> 23:49.840\n about human interactions.\n\n23:49.840 --> 23:51.600\n It's actually clear now that there's a lot of stuff\n\n23:51.600 --> 23:53.480\n we didn't know about viruses\n\n23:53.480 --> 23:56.000\n and about the way immunity works and so on.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.840\n And it's, you know, I think what will come out in the end\n\n23:58.840 --> 24:02.000\n is there's a certain amount of what happens\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:04.320\n that we just kind of have to trace each step\n\n24:04.320 --> 24:05.800\n and see what happens.\n\n24:05.800 --> 24:06.960\n There's a certain amount of stuff\n\n24:06.960 --> 24:08.280\n where there's going to be a big narrative\n\n24:08.280 --> 24:12.240\n about this happened because, you know, of T cell immunity.\n\n24:12.240 --> 24:14.320\n This could happen because there's this whole giant\n\n24:14.320 --> 24:18.640\n sort of field of asymptomatic viral stuff out there.\n\n24:18.640 --> 24:20.120\n You know, there will be a narrative\n\n24:20.120 --> 24:22.400\n and that narrative, whenever there's a narrative,\n\n24:22.400 --> 24:24.600\n that's kind of a sign of reducibility.\n\n24:24.600 --> 24:26.000\n But when you just say,\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.880\n let's from first principles figure out what's going on,\n\n24:28.880 --> 24:30.880\n then you can potentially be stuck\n\n24:30.880 --> 24:33.720\n in this kind of a mess of irreducibility\n\n24:33.720 --> 24:35.680\n where you just have to simulate each step\n\n24:35.680 --> 24:38.240\n and you can't do that unless you know details about,\n\n24:38.240 --> 24:40.120\n you know, human interaction networks\n\n24:40.120 --> 24:41.360\n and so on and so on and so on.\n\n24:41.360 --> 24:46.360\n The thing that has been very sort of frustrating to see\n\n24:46.440 --> 24:48.920\n is the mismatch between people's expectations\n\n24:48.920 --> 24:50.760\n about what science can deliver\n\n24:50.760 --> 24:53.680\n and what science can actually deliver, so to speak.\n\n24:53.680 --> 24:56.760\n Because people have this idea that, you know, it's science.\n\n24:56.760 --> 24:58.480\n So there must be a definite answer\n\n24:58.480 --> 25:00.520\n and we must be able to know that answer.\n\n25:00.520 --> 25:05.040\n And, you know, this is, it is both, you know,\n\n25:05.040 --> 25:07.600\n when you've, after you've played around\n\n25:07.600 --> 25:10.080\n with sort of little programs in the computational universe,\n\n25:10.080 --> 25:11.840\n you don't have that intuition anymore.\n\n25:11.840 --> 25:14.520\n You know, it's, I always, I'm always fond of saying,\n\n25:14.520 --> 25:17.040\n you know, the computational animals\n\n25:17.040 --> 25:18.240\n are always smarter than you are.\n\n25:18.240 --> 25:20.240\n That is, you know, you look at one of these things\n\n25:20.240 --> 25:23.240\n and it's like, it can't possibly do such and such a thing.\n\n25:23.240 --> 25:25.280\n Then you run it and it's like, wait a minute,\n\n25:25.280 --> 25:26.200\n it's doing that thing.\n\n25:26.200 --> 25:27.520\n How does that work?\n\n25:27.520 --> 25:29.320\n Okay, now I can go back and understand it.\n\n25:29.320 --> 25:31.520\n But that's the brave thing about science\n\n25:31.520 --> 25:35.880\n is that in the chaos of the irreducible universe,\n\n25:35.880 --> 25:38.600\n we nevertheless persist to find those pockets.\n\n25:38.600 --> 25:40.240\n That's kind of the whole point.\n\n25:40.240 --> 25:43.000\n That's like, you say that the limits of science,\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:46.800\n but that, you know, yes, it's highly limited,\n\n25:46.800 --> 25:48.800\n but there's a hope there.\n\n25:48.800 --> 25:51.960\n And like, there's so many questions I want to ask here.\n\n25:51.960 --> 25:54.160\n So one, you said narrative, which is really interesting.\n\n25:54.160 --> 25:58.040\n So obviously from a, at every level of society,\n\n25:58.040 --> 26:00.400\n you look at Twitter, everybody's constructing narratives\n\n26:00.400 --> 26:03.120\n about the pandemic, about not just the pandemic,\n\n26:03.120 --> 26:06.000\n but all the cultural tension that we're going through.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:07.000\n So there's narratives,\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:10.200\n but they're not necessarily connected\n\n26:10.200 --> 26:15.200\n to the underlying reality of these systems.\n\n26:17.400 --> 26:21.120\n So our human narratives, I don't even know if they're,\n\n26:22.440 --> 26:25.360\n I don't like those pockets of reducibility\n\n26:25.360 --> 26:29.480\n because we're, it's like constructing things\n\n26:29.480 --> 26:31.800\n that are not actually representative of reality,\n\n26:33.360 --> 26:36.360\n and thereby not giving us like good solutions\n\n26:36.360 --> 26:39.520\n to how to predict the system.\n\n26:39.520 --> 26:41.120\n Look, it gets complicated because, you know,\n\n26:41.120 --> 26:43.840\n people want to say, explain the pandemic to me,\n\n26:43.840 --> 26:45.320\n explain what's going to happen.\n\n26:45.320 --> 26:46.360\n In the future.\n\n26:46.360 --> 26:48.200\n Yes, but also, can you explain it?\n\n26:48.200 --> 26:49.520\n Is there a story to tell?\n\n26:49.520 --> 26:51.440\n What already happened in the past?\n\n26:51.440 --> 26:53.040\n Yeah, or what's going to happen,\n\n26:53.040 --> 26:55.280\n but I mean, you know, it's similar to sort of\n\n26:55.280 --> 26:58.560\n explaining things in AI or in any computational system.\n\n26:58.560 --> 27:00.960\n It's like, you know, explain what happened.\n\n27:00.960 --> 27:03.000\n Well, it could just be this happened\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.240\n because of this detail and this detail and this detail,\n\n27:05.240 --> 27:06.880\n and a million details,\n\n27:06.880 --> 27:08.600\n and there isn't a big story to tell.\n\n27:08.600 --> 27:12.000\n There's no kind of big arc of the story that says,\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.480\n oh, it's because, you know, there's a viral field\n\n27:14.480 --> 27:15.640\n that has these properties\n\n27:15.640 --> 27:17.680\n and people start showing symptoms.\n\n27:17.680 --> 27:20.040\n You know, when the seasons change,\n\n27:20.040 --> 27:21.000\n people will show symptoms\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:22.480\n and people don't even understand, you know,\n\n27:22.480 --> 27:24.640\n seasonal variation of flu, for example.\n\n27:24.640 --> 27:28.480\n It's something where, you know,\n\n27:28.480 --> 27:29.920\n there could be a big story,\n\n27:29.920 --> 27:33.800\n or it could be just a zillion little details that mount up.\n\n27:33.800 --> 27:38.200\n See, but, okay, let's pretend that this pandemic,\n\n27:38.200 --> 27:41.080\n like the coronavirus, resembles something\n\n27:41.080 --> 27:45.840\n like the 1D rule 30 cellular automata, okay?\n\n27:45.840 --> 27:50.840\n So, I mean, that's how epidemiologists model virus spread.\n\n27:51.880 --> 27:52.720\n Indeed, yes.\n\n27:52.720 --> 27:54.320\n They sometimes use cellular automata, yes.\n\n27:54.320 --> 27:57.280\n Yeah, and okay, so you could say it's simplistic,\n\n27:57.280 --> 28:00.520\n but okay, let's say it's representative\n\n28:00.520 --> 28:02.320\n of actually what happens.\n\n28:02.320 --> 28:06.240\n You know, the dynamic of,\n\n28:06.240 --> 28:07.480\n you have a graph,\n\n28:07.480 --> 28:09.760\n it probably is closer to the hypergraph model.\n\n28:09.760 --> 28:10.600\n It is, yes.\n\n28:10.600 --> 28:13.280\n It's actually, that's another funny thing.\n\n28:13.280 --> 28:15.320\n As we were getting ready to release this physics project,\n\n28:15.320 --> 28:17.200\n we realized that a bunch of things we'd worked out\n\n28:17.200 --> 28:20.680\n about foliations of causal graphs and things\n\n28:20.680 --> 28:23.520\n were directly relevant to thinking about contact tracing.\n\n28:23.520 --> 28:24.360\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n28:24.360 --> 28:25.920\n And interactions with cell phones and so on,\n\n28:25.920 --> 28:27.200\n which is really weird.\n\n28:27.200 --> 28:29.680\n But like, it just feels like,\n\n28:29.680 --> 28:31.000\n it feels like we should be able to get\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:34.960\n some beautiful core insight about the spread\n\n28:34.960 --> 28:36.720\n of this particular virus\n\n28:36.720 --> 28:40.040\n on the hypergraph of human civilization, right?\n\n28:40.040 --> 28:42.360\n I tried, I didn't manage to figure it out.\n\n28:42.360 --> 28:43.520\n But you're one person.\n\n28:43.520 --> 28:46.240\n Yeah, but I mean, I think actually it's a funny thing\n\n28:46.240 --> 28:48.360\n because it turns out the main model,\n\n28:48.360 --> 28:49.960\n you know, this SIR model,\n\n28:49.960 --> 28:53.280\n I only realized recently was invented by the grandfather\n\n28:53.280 --> 28:55.160\n of a good friend of mine from high school.\n\n28:55.160 --> 28:58.800\n So that was just a, you know, it's a weird thing, right?\n\n28:58.800 --> 29:02.240\n The question is, you know, okay, so you know,\n\n29:02.240 --> 29:04.400\n on this graph of how humans are connected,\n\n29:04.400 --> 29:05.880\n you know something about what happens\n\n29:05.880 --> 29:07.520\n if this happens and that happens.\n\n29:07.520 --> 29:09.680\n That graph is made in complicated ways\n\n29:09.680 --> 29:11.480\n that depends on all sorts of issues\n\n29:11.480 --> 29:13.120\n that where we don't have the data\n\n29:13.120 --> 29:15.200\n about how human society works well enough\n\n29:15.200 --> 29:17.160\n to be able to make that graph.\n\n29:17.160 --> 29:20.480\n There's actually, one of my kids did a study\n\n29:20.480 --> 29:23.320\n of sort of what happens on different kinds of graphs\n\n29:23.320 --> 29:25.720\n and how robust are the results, okay?\n\n29:25.720 --> 29:28.760\n His basic answer is there are a few general results\n\n29:28.760 --> 29:30.720\n that you can get that are quite robust.\n\n29:30.720 --> 29:33.080\n Like, you know, a small number of big gatherings\n\n29:33.080 --> 29:36.280\n is worse than a large number of small gatherings, okay?\n\n29:36.280 --> 29:37.680\n That's quite robust.\n\n29:37.680 --> 29:40.120\n But when you ask more detailed questions,\n\n29:40.120 --> 29:42.960\n it seemed like it just depends.\n\n29:42.960 --> 29:44.200\n It depends on details.\n\n29:44.200 --> 29:47.240\n In other words, it's kind of telling you in that case,\n\n29:47.240 --> 29:49.760\n you know, the irreducibility matters, so to speak.\n\n29:49.760 --> 29:53.040\n It's not, there's not gonna be this kind of one\n\n29:53.040 --> 29:55.040\n sort of master theorem that says,\n\n29:55.040 --> 29:57.520\n and therefore this is how things are gonna work.\n\n29:57.520 --> 29:59.040\n Yeah, but there's a certain kind of,\n\n29:59.040 --> 30:01.480\n from a graph perspective,\n\n30:01.480 --> 30:04.720\n the certain kind of dynamic to human interaction.\n\n30:04.720 --> 30:08.640\n So like large groups and small groups,\n\n30:08.640 --> 30:10.520\n I think it matters who the groups are.\n\n30:10.520 --> 30:12.600\n For example, you could imagine large,\n\n30:12.600 --> 30:13.720\n depends how you define large,\n\n30:13.720 --> 30:17.120\n but you can imagine groups of 30 people,\n\n30:17.120 --> 30:22.120\n as long as they are cliques or whatever.\n\n30:22.440 --> 30:23.280\n Right.\n\n30:23.280 --> 30:27.640\n As long as the outgoing degree of that graph is small\n\n30:27.640 --> 30:28.480\n or something like that,\n\n30:28.480 --> 30:31.360\n like you can imagine some beautiful underlying rule\n\n30:31.360 --> 30:34.640\n of human dynamic interaction where I can still be happy,\n\n30:34.640 --> 30:36.520\n where I can have a conversation with you\n\n30:36.520 --> 30:39.640\n and a bunch of other people that mean a lot to me in my life\n\n30:39.640 --> 30:42.560\n and then stay away from the bigger, I don't know,\n\n30:42.560 --> 30:45.600\n not going to a Miley Cyrus concert or something like that\n\n30:45.600 --> 30:49.840\n and figuring out mathematically some nice.\n\n30:49.840 --> 30:51.080\n See, this is an interesting thing.\n\n30:51.080 --> 30:54.760\n So I mean, this is the question of what you're describing\n\n30:54.760 --> 30:59.320\n is kind of the problem of the many situations\n\n30:59.320 --> 31:00.600\n where you would like to get away\n\n31:00.600 --> 31:02.040\n from computational irreducibility.\n\n31:02.040 --> 31:05.080\n A classic one in physics is thermodynamics.\n\n31:05.080 --> 31:06.840\n The second law of thermodynamics,\n\n31:06.840 --> 31:09.880\n the law that says entropy tends to increase things\n\n31:09.880 --> 31:13.240\n that start orderly tend to get more disordered,\n\n31:13.240 --> 31:15.040\n or which is also the thing that says,\n\n31:15.040 --> 31:16.640\n given that you have a bunch of heat,\n\n31:16.640 --> 31:19.800\n it's hard, heat is the microscopic motion of molecules,\n\n31:19.800 --> 31:23.600\n it's hard to turn that heat into systematic mechanical work.\n\n31:23.600 --> 31:26.240\n It's hard to just take something being hot\n\n31:26.240 --> 31:29.840\n and turn that into, oh, all the atoms are gonna line up\n\n31:29.840 --> 31:31.520\n in the bar of metal and the piece of metal\n\n31:31.520 --> 31:33.600\n is gonna shoot in some direction.\n\n31:33.600 --> 31:35.800\n That's essentially the same problem\n\n31:35.800 --> 31:40.040\n as how do you go from this computationally irreducible\n\n31:40.040 --> 31:41.680\n mess of things happening\n\n31:41.680 --> 31:43.560\n and get something you want out of it.\n\n31:43.560 --> 31:45.760\n It's kind of mining, you're kind of,\n\n31:45.760 --> 31:48.320\n now, actually I've understood in recent years\n\n31:48.320 --> 31:50.880\n that the story of thermodynamics\n\n31:50.880 --> 31:54.400\n is actually precisely a story of computational irreducibility,\n\n31:54.400 --> 31:58.600\n but it is a, it is already an analogy.\n\n31:58.600 --> 32:02.080\n You can kind of see that as can you take the,\n\n32:02.080 --> 32:03.560\n what you're asking to do there\n\n32:03.560 --> 32:07.840\n is you're asking to go from the kind of,\n\n32:07.840 --> 32:10.080\n the mess of all these complicated human interactions\n\n32:10.080 --> 32:12.360\n and all this kind of computational processes going on\n\n32:12.360 --> 32:14.120\n and you say, I want to achieve\n\n32:14.120 --> 32:15.240\n this particular thing out of it.\n\n32:15.240 --> 32:18.680\n I want to kind of extract from the heat of what's happening.\n\n32:18.680 --> 32:22.160\n I want to kind of extract this useful piece\n\n32:22.160 --> 32:25.240\n of sort of mechanical work that I find helpful.\n\n32:25.240 --> 32:26.080\n I mean.\n\n32:26.080 --> 32:27.320\n Do you have a hope for the pandemic?\n\n32:27.320 --> 32:28.600\n So we'll talk about physics,\n\n32:28.600 --> 32:31.320\n but for the pandemic, can that be extracted?\n\n32:31.320 --> 32:32.160\n Do you think?\n\n32:32.160 --> 32:33.120\n What's your intuition?\n\n32:33.120 --> 32:36.520\n The good news is the curves basically,\n\n32:36.520 --> 32:38.480\n for reasons we don't understand,\n\n32:38.480 --> 32:42.560\n the curves, the clearly measurable mortality curves\n\n32:42.560 --> 32:46.360\n and so on for the Northern Hemisphere have gone down.\n\n32:46.360 --> 32:50.320\n Yeah, but the bad news is that it could be a lot worse\n\n32:50.320 --> 32:51.640\n for future viruses.\n\n32:51.640 --> 32:55.200\n And what this pandemic revealed is we're highly unprepared\n\n32:55.200 --> 32:59.840\n for the discovery of the pockets of reducibility\n\n32:59.840 --> 33:02.560\n within a pandemic that's much more dangerous.\n\n33:02.560 --> 33:07.400\n Well, my guess is the specific risk of viral pandemics,\n\n33:07.400 --> 33:10.400\n you know, that the pure virology\n\n33:10.400 --> 33:12.760\n and immunology of the thing,\n\n33:12.760 --> 33:14.720\n this will cause that to advance to the point\n\n33:14.720 --> 33:16.640\n where this particular risk\n\n33:16.640 --> 33:19.040\n is probably considerably mitigated.\n\n33:19.040 --> 33:24.040\n But is the structure of modern society robust\n\n33:25.160 --> 33:26.920\n to all kinds of risks?\n\n33:26.920 --> 33:29.160\n Well, the answer is clearly no.\n\n33:29.160 --> 33:34.120\n And it's surprising to me the extent to which people,\n\n33:34.120 --> 33:37.320\n as I say, it's kind of scary actually\n\n33:37.320 --> 33:39.360\n how much people believe in science.\n\n33:39.360 --> 33:41.560\n That is people say, oh, you know,\n\n33:41.560 --> 33:43.160\n because the science says this, that and the other,\n\n33:43.160 --> 33:44.320\n we'll do this and this and this,\n\n33:44.320 --> 33:46.760\n even though from a sort of common sense point of view,\n\n33:46.760 --> 33:50.440\n it's a little bit crazy and people are not prepared\n\n33:50.440 --> 33:52.600\n and it doesn't really work in society\n\n33:52.600 --> 33:53.600\n as it is for people to say,\n\n33:53.600 --> 33:56.520\n well, actually we don't really know how the science works.\n\n33:56.520 --> 33:58.600\n People say, well, tell us what to do.\n\n33:58.600 --> 34:01.600\n Yeah, because then, yeah, what's the alternative?\n\n34:01.600 --> 34:04.960\n For the masses, it's difficult to sit,\n\n34:04.960 --> 34:08.560\n it's difficult to meditate on computational reducibility.\n\n34:08.560 --> 34:10.280\n It's difficult to sit,\n\n34:10.280 --> 34:13.120\n it's difficult to enjoy a good dinner meal\n\n34:13.120 --> 34:15.600\n while knowing that you know nothing about the world.\n\n34:15.600 --> 34:17.800\n Well, I think this is a place where, you know,\n\n34:17.800 --> 34:21.160\n this is what politicians and political leaders do\n\n34:21.160 --> 34:22.120\n for a living, so to speak,\n\n34:22.120 --> 34:24.880\n is you've got to make some decision about what to do.\n\n34:24.880 --> 34:25.840\n And it's...\n\n34:25.840 --> 34:29.760\n Tell some narrative that while amidst the mystery\n\n34:29.760 --> 34:33.760\n and knowing not much about the past or the future,\n\n34:33.760 --> 34:37.240\n still telling a narrative that somehow gives people hope\n\n34:37.240 --> 34:39.200\n that we know what the heck we're doing.\n\n34:39.200 --> 34:41.520\n Yeah, and get society through the issue.\n\n34:41.520 --> 34:43.440\n You know, even though, you know,\n\n34:43.440 --> 34:45.560\n the idea that we're just gonna, you know,\n\n34:45.560 --> 34:48.600\n sort of be able to get the definitive answer from science\n\n34:48.600 --> 34:50.600\n and it's gonna tell us exactly what to do.\n\n34:50.600 --> 34:54.360\n Unfortunately, you know, it's interesting\n\n34:54.360 --> 34:56.880\n because let me point out that if that was possible,\n\n34:56.880 --> 34:59.200\n if science could always tell us what to do,\n\n34:59.200 --> 35:01.920\n then in a sense, our, you know,\n\n35:01.920 --> 35:03.960\n that would be a big downer for our lives.\n\n35:03.960 --> 35:05.080\n If science could always tell us\n\n35:05.080 --> 35:06.760\n what the answer is gonna be,\n\n35:06.760 --> 35:08.720\n it's like, well, you know,\n\n35:08.720 --> 35:10.120\n it's kind of fun to live one's life\n\n35:10.120 --> 35:11.720\n and just sort of see what happens.\n\n35:11.720 --> 35:12.960\n If one could always just say,\n\n35:12.960 --> 35:15.080\n let me check my science.\n\n35:15.080 --> 35:16.760\n Oh, I know, you know,\n\n35:16.760 --> 35:18.320\n the result of everything is gonna be 42.\n\n35:18.320 --> 35:21.000\n I don't need to live my life and do what I do.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\n It's just, we already know the answer.\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:24.840\n It's actually good news in a sense\n\n35:24.840 --> 35:25.960\n that there is this phenomenon\n\n35:25.960 --> 35:27.640\n of computational irreducibility\n\n35:27.640 --> 35:30.760\n that doesn't allow you to just sort of jump through time\n\n35:30.760 --> 35:33.680\n and say, this is the answer, so to speak.\n\n35:33.680 --> 35:35.160\n And that's, so that's a good thing.\n\n35:35.160 --> 35:38.120\n The bad thing is it doesn't allow you to jump through time\n\n35:38.120 --> 35:39.640\n and know what the answer is.\n\n35:39.640 --> 35:40.960\n It's scary.\n\n35:40.960 --> 35:44.160\n Do you think we're gonna be okay as a human civilization?\n\n35:44.160 --> 35:46.120\n You said, we don't know.\n\n35:46.120 --> 35:46.960\n Absolutely.\n\n35:47.920 --> 35:52.920\n Do you think we'll prosper or destroy ourselves?\n\n35:53.920 --> 35:54.760\n In general?\n\n35:54.760 --> 35:55.720\n In general.\n\n35:55.720 --> 35:57.760\n I'm an optimist.\n\n35:57.760 --> 35:59.200\n No, I think that, you know,\n\n35:59.200 --> 36:01.000\n it'll be interesting to see, for example,\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:02.480\n with this, you know, pandemic,\n\n36:02.480 --> 36:05.720\n I, you know, to me, you know,\n\n36:05.720 --> 36:08.320\n when you look at like organizations, for example,\n\n36:08.320 --> 36:10.920\n you know, having some kind of perturbation,\n\n36:10.920 --> 36:12.840\n some kick to the system,\n\n36:12.840 --> 36:16.120\n usually the end result of that is actually quite good.\n\n36:16.120 --> 36:17.720\n You know, unless it kills the system,\n\n36:17.720 --> 36:19.520\n it's actually quite good usually.\n\n36:19.520 --> 36:22.280\n And I think in this case, you know, people,\n\n36:22.280 --> 36:23.840\n I mean, my impression, you know,\n\n36:23.840 --> 36:25.400\n it's a little weird for me because, you know,\n\n36:25.400 --> 36:28.000\n I've been a remote tech CEO for 30 years.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.720\n It doesn't, you know, this is bizarrely, you know,\n\n36:30.720 --> 36:33.920\n and the fact that, you know, like this coming to see you here\n\n36:33.920 --> 36:38.920\n is the first time in six months that I've been like,\n\n36:39.160 --> 36:41.360\n you know, in a building other than my house, okay?\n\n36:41.360 --> 36:46.160\n So, you know, I'm a kind of ridiculous outlier\n\n36:46.160 --> 36:47.040\n in these kinds of things.\n\n36:47.040 --> 36:50.920\n But overall, your sense is when you shake up the system\n\n36:50.920 --> 36:55.200\n and throw in chaos that you challenge the system,\n\n36:55.200 --> 36:57.720\n we humans emerge better.\n\n36:57.720 --> 36:58.800\n Seems to be that way.\n\n36:58.800 --> 36:59.640\n Who's to know?\n\n36:59.640 --> 37:01.920\n I think that, you know, people, you know,\n\n37:01.920 --> 37:05.040\n my sort of vague impression is that people are sort of,\n\n37:05.040 --> 37:07.280\n you know, oh, what's actually important?\n\n37:07.280 --> 37:10.400\n You know, what is worth caring about and so on?\n\n37:10.400 --> 37:14.280\n And that seems to be something that perhaps is more,\n\n37:14.280 --> 37:16.840\n you know, emergent in this kind of situation.\n\n37:16.840 --> 37:19.840\n It's so fascinating that on the individual level,\n\n37:19.840 --> 37:22.320\n we have our own complex cognition.\n\n37:22.320 --> 37:24.080\n We have consciousness, we have intelligence,\n\n37:24.080 --> 37:25.960\n we're trying to figure out little puzzles.\n\n37:25.960 --> 37:28.280\n And then that somehow creates this graph\n\n37:28.280 --> 37:30.280\n of collective intelligence.\n\n37:30.280 --> 37:33.920\n Well, we figure out, and then you throw in these viruses\n\n37:33.920 --> 37:36.600\n of which there's millions different, you know,\n\n37:36.600 --> 37:39.360\n there's entire taxonomy and the viruses are thrown\n\n37:39.360 --> 37:42.640\n into the system of collective human intelligence.\n\n37:42.640 --> 37:45.680\n And when little humans figure out what to do about it,\n\n37:45.680 --> 37:48.680\n we get like, we tweet stuff about information.\n\n37:48.680 --> 37:50.720\n There's doctors as conspiracy theorists.\n\n37:50.720 --> 37:53.120\n And then we play with different information.\n\n37:53.120 --> 37:55.680\n I mean, the whole of it is fascinating.\n\n37:55.680 --> 37:58.080\n I am like you also very optimistic,\n\n37:58.080 --> 38:02.660\n but you said the computational reducibility.\n\n38:04.120 --> 38:06.440\n There's always a fear of the darkness\n\n38:06.440 --> 38:09.760\n of the uncertainty before us.\n\n38:09.760 --> 38:11.120\n Yeah, I know. And it's scary.\n\n38:11.120 --> 38:13.400\n I mean, the thing is, if you knew everything,\n\n38:13.400 --> 38:14.320\n it will be boring.\n\n38:15.280 --> 38:19.720\n And it would be, and then, and worse than boring,\n\n38:19.720 --> 38:20.560\n so to speak.\n\n38:20.560 --> 38:24.120\n It would reveal the pointlessness, so to speak.\n\n38:24.120 --> 38:26.540\n And in a sense, the fact that there is\n\n38:26.540 --> 38:28.000\n this computational irreducibility,\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:30.360\n it's like as we live our lives, so to speak,\n\n38:30.360 --> 38:31.660\n something is being achieved.\n\n38:31.660 --> 38:34.360\n We're computing what our lives, you know,\n\n38:35.520 --> 38:36.900\n what happens in our lives.\n\n38:36.900 --> 38:37.740\n That's funny.\n\n38:37.740 --> 38:40.520\n So the computational reducibility is kind of like,\n\n38:40.520 --> 38:41.980\n it gives the meaning to life.\n\n38:41.980 --> 38:43.360\n It is the meaning of life.\n\n38:43.360 --> 38:45.720\n Computational reducibility is the meaning of life.\n\n38:45.720 --> 38:46.560\n There you go.\n\n38:46.560 --> 38:47.480\n It gives it meaning, yes.\n\n38:47.480 --> 38:51.580\n I mean, it's what causes it to not be something\n\n38:51.580 --> 38:53.540\n where you can just say, you know,\n\n38:53.540 --> 38:55.760\n you went through all those steps to live your life,\n\n38:55.760 --> 38:58.560\n but we already knew what the answer was.\n\n38:58.560 --> 38:59.400\n Hold on one second.\n\n38:59.400 --> 39:03.120\n I'm going to use my handy Wolfram Alpha sunburn\n\n39:03.120 --> 39:06.120\n computation thing, so long as I can get network here.\n\n39:06.120 --> 39:06.940\n There we go.\n\n39:08.240 --> 39:09.460\n Oh, actually, you know what?\n\n39:09.460 --> 39:11.460\n It says sunburn unlikely.\n\n39:11.460 --> 39:12.680\n This is a QA moment.\n\n39:12.680 --> 39:16.720\n This is a good moment.\n\n39:16.720 --> 39:20.560\n Okay, well, let me just check what it thinks.\n\n39:20.560 --> 39:22.000\n See why it thinks that.\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:23.540\n It doesn't seem like my intuition.\n\n39:23.540 --> 39:25.360\n This is one of these cases where we can,\n\n39:25.360 --> 39:27.800\n the question is, do we trust the science\n\n39:27.800 --> 39:30.360\n or do we use common sense?\n\n39:30.360 --> 39:32.000\n The UV thing is cool.\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:32.880\n Yeah, yeah, well, we'll see.\n\n39:32.880 --> 39:35.040\n This is a QA moment, as I say.\n\n39:35.040 --> 39:37.960\n It's, do we trust the product?\n\n39:37.960 --> 39:39.560\n Yes, we trust the product, so.\n\n39:39.560 --> 39:42.240\n And then there'll be a data point either way.\n\n39:42.240 --> 39:43.560\n If I'm desperately sunburned,\n\n39:43.560 --> 39:46.840\n I will send in an angry feedback.\n\n39:46.840 --> 39:50.760\n Because we mentioned the concept so much\n\n39:50.760 --> 39:51.960\n and a lot of people know it,\n\n39:51.960 --> 39:54.480\n but can you say what computational reducibility is?\n\n39:54.480 --> 39:55.320\n Yeah, right.\n\n39:55.320 --> 39:58.760\n The question is, if you think about things\n\n39:58.760 --> 40:01.160\n that happen as being computations,\n\n40:01.160 --> 40:06.080\n you think about some process in physics,\n\n40:06.080 --> 40:09.120\n something that you compute in mathematics, whatever else,\n\n40:09.120 --> 40:11.920\n it's a computation in the sense it has definite rules.\n\n40:11.920 --> 40:13.640\n You follow those rules.\n\n40:13.640 --> 40:18.360\n You follow them many steps and you get some result.\n\n40:18.360 --> 40:20.080\n So then the issue is,\n\n40:20.080 --> 40:21.960\n if you look at all these different kinds of computations\n\n40:21.960 --> 40:22.800\n that can happen,\n\n40:22.800 --> 40:23.760\n whether they're computations\n\n40:23.760 --> 40:24.880\n that are happening in the natural world,\n\n40:24.880 --> 40:26.560\n whether they're happening in our brains,\n\n40:26.560 --> 40:28.080\n whether they're happening in our mathematics,\n\n40:28.080 --> 40:29.040\n whatever else,\n\n40:29.040 --> 40:32.120\n the big question is, how do these computations compare?\n\n40:32.120 --> 40:35.560\n Is, are there dumb computations and smart computations\n\n40:35.560 --> 40:37.520\n or are they somehow all equivalent?\n\n40:37.520 --> 40:41.720\n And the thing that I kind of was sort of surprised to realize\n\n40:41.720 --> 40:43.960\n from a bunch of experiments that I did in the early nineties\n\n40:43.960 --> 40:46.080\n and now we have tons more evidence for it,\n\n40:46.080 --> 40:48.880\n this thing I call the principle of computational equivalence,\n\n40:48.880 --> 40:51.920\n which basically says, when one of these computations,\n\n40:51.920 --> 40:54.280\n one of these processes that follows rules,\n\n40:54.280 --> 40:57.640\n doesn't seem like it's doing something obviously simple,\n\n40:57.640 --> 41:00.120\n then it has reached the sort of equivalent level\n\n41:00.120 --> 41:03.720\n of computational sophistication of everything.\n\n41:03.720 --> 41:04.560\n So what does that mean?\n\n41:04.560 --> 41:07.560\n That means that, you might say, gosh,\n\n41:07.560 --> 41:11.600\n I'm studying this little tiny program on my computer.\n\n41:11.600 --> 41:14.280\n I'm studying this little thing in nature,\n\n41:14.280 --> 41:15.360\n but I have my brain\n\n41:15.360 --> 41:18.440\n and my brain is surely much smarter than that thing.\n\n41:18.440 --> 41:20.520\n I'm gonna be able to systematically outrun\n\n41:20.520 --> 41:22.120\n the computation that it does\n\n41:22.120 --> 41:24.000\n because I have a more sophisticated computation\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:25.160\n that I can do.\n\n41:25.160 --> 41:27.400\n But what the principle of computational equivalence says\n\n41:27.400 --> 41:29.000\n is that doesn't work.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.800\n Our brains are doing computations\n\n41:31.800 --> 41:34.600\n that are exactly equivalent to the kinds of computations\n\n41:34.600 --> 41:36.920\n that are being done in all these other sorts of systems.\n\n41:36.920 --> 41:38.320\n And so what consequences does that have?\n\n41:38.320 --> 41:40.640\n Well, it means that we can't systematically\n\n41:40.640 --> 41:42.240\n outrun these systems.\n\n41:42.240 --> 41:45.840\n These systems are computationally irreducible\n\n41:45.840 --> 41:47.800\n in the sense that there's no sort of shortcut\n\n41:47.800 --> 41:50.440\n that we can make that jumps to the answer.\n\n41:50.440 --> 41:51.880\n Now the general case.\n\n41:51.880 --> 41:52.920\n Right, right.\n\n41:52.920 --> 41:55.280\n But the, so what has happened,\n\n41:55.280 --> 41:58.760\n what science has become used to doing\n\n41:58.760 --> 42:00.720\n is using the little sort of pockets\n\n42:00.720 --> 42:02.840\n of computational reducibility,\n\n42:02.840 --> 42:04.800\n which by the way are an inevitable consequence\n\n42:04.800 --> 42:06.680\n of computational irreducibility,\n\n42:06.680 --> 42:08.640\n that there have to be these pockets\n\n42:08.640 --> 42:11.480\n scattered around of computational reducibility\n\n42:11.480 --> 42:14.440\n to be able to find those particular cases\n\n42:14.440 --> 42:15.280\n where you can jump ahead.\n\n42:15.280 --> 42:17.320\n I mean, one thing sort of a little bit\n\n42:17.320 --> 42:20.440\n of a parable type thing that I think is fun to tell.\n\n42:20.440 --> 42:22.440\n If you look at ancient Babylon,\n\n42:22.440 --> 42:25.120\n they were trying to predict three kinds of things.\n\n42:25.120 --> 42:27.960\n They tried to predict where the planets would be,\n\n42:27.960 --> 42:29.440\n what the weather would be like,\n\n42:29.440 --> 42:32.160\n and who would win or lose a certain battle.\n\n42:32.160 --> 42:34.560\n And they had no idea which of these things\n\n42:34.560 --> 42:36.480\n would be more predictable than the other.\n\n42:36.480 --> 42:37.320\n That's funny.\n\n42:37.320 --> 42:40.920\n And it turns out where the planets are\n\n42:40.920 --> 42:43.600\n is a piece of computational reducibility\n\n42:43.600 --> 42:46.680\n that 300 years ago or so we pretty much cracked.\n\n42:46.680 --> 42:48.000\n I mean, it's been technically difficult\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:49.040\n to get all the details right,\n\n42:49.040 --> 42:52.160\n but it's basically, we got that.\n\n42:52.160 --> 42:54.160\n Who's gonna win or lose the battle?\n\n42:54.160 --> 42:55.400\n No, we didn't crack that one.\n\n42:55.400 --> 42:57.600\n That one, that one, right.\n\n42:57.600 --> 42:58.920\n Game theorists are trying.\n\n42:58.920 --> 43:00.800\n Yes. And then the weather.\n\n43:00.800 --> 43:02.480\n It's kind of halfway on that one.\n\n43:02.480 --> 43:03.320\n Halfway?\n\n43:03.320 --> 43:05.520\n Yeah, I think we're doing okay on that one.\n\n43:05.520 --> 43:07.360\n Long term climate, different story.\n\n43:07.360 --> 43:10.040\n But the weather, we're much closer on that.\n\n43:10.040 --> 43:11.920\n But do you think eventually we'll figure out the weather?\n\n43:11.920 --> 43:15.120\n So do you think eventually most think\n\n43:15.120 --> 43:17.600\n we'll figure out the local pockets in everything,\n\n43:17.600 --> 43:19.800\n essentially the local pockets of reducibility?\n\n43:19.800 --> 43:22.720\n No, I think that it's an interesting question,\n\n43:22.720 --> 43:25.560\n but I think that there is an infinite collection\n\n43:25.560 --> 43:26.720\n of these local pockets.\n\n43:26.720 --> 43:28.560\n We'll never run out of local pockets.\n\n43:28.560 --> 43:30.600\n And by the way, those local pockets\n\n43:30.600 --> 43:33.120\n are where we build engineering, for example.\n\n43:33.120 --> 43:36.880\n That's how we, if we want to have a predictable life,\n\n43:36.880 --> 43:40.520\n so to speak, then we have to build\n\n43:40.520 --> 43:43.000\n in these sort of pockets of reducibility.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:46.520\n Otherwise, if we were sort of existing\n\n43:46.520 --> 43:48.720\n in this kind of irreducible world,\n\n43:48.720 --> 43:51.800\n we'd never be able to have definite things\n\n43:51.800 --> 43:53.240\n to know what's gonna happen.\n\n43:53.240 --> 43:55.400\n I have to say, I think one of the features,\n\n43:55.400 --> 43:59.920\n when we look at sort of today from the future, so to speak,\n\n43:59.920 --> 44:02.120\n I suspect one of the things where people will say\n\n44:02.120 --> 44:04.440\n I can't believe they didn't see that\n\n44:04.440 --> 44:07.000\n is stuff to do with the following kind of thing.\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:10.160\n So if we describe, oh, I don't know,\n\n44:10.160 --> 44:12.880\n something like heat, for instance,\n\n44:12.880 --> 44:17.880\n we say, oh, the air in here, it's this temperature,\n\n44:17.880 --> 44:20.320\n this pressure, that's as much as we can say.\n\n44:20.320 --> 44:23.240\n Otherwise, just a bunch of random molecules bouncing around.\n\n44:23.240 --> 44:26.080\n People will say, I just can't believe they didn't realize\n\n44:26.080 --> 44:27.240\n that there was all this detail\n\n44:27.240 --> 44:29.320\n and how all these molecules were bouncing around\n\n44:29.320 --> 44:30.840\n and they could make use of that.\n\n44:31.800 --> 44:32.920\n And actually, I realized there's a thing\n\n44:32.920 --> 44:34.720\n I realized last week, actually,\n\n44:34.720 --> 44:37.680\n was a thing that people say, one of the scenarios\n\n44:37.680 --> 44:40.040\n for the very long term history of our universe\n\n44:40.040 --> 44:42.560\n is a so called heat death of the universe,\n\n44:42.560 --> 44:44.840\n where basically everything just becomes\n\n44:44.840 --> 44:47.160\n thermodynamically boring.\n\n44:47.160 --> 44:48.840\n Everything's just this big kind of gas\n\n44:48.840 --> 44:50.080\n and thermal equilibrium.\n\n44:50.080 --> 44:52.640\n People say, that's a really bad outcome.\n\n44:52.640 --> 44:54.960\n But actually, it's not a really bad outcome.\n\n44:54.960 --> 44:57.360\n It's an outcome where there's all this computation going on\n\n44:57.360 --> 44:58.920\n and all those individual gas molecules\n\n44:58.920 --> 45:01.440\n are all bouncing around in very complicated ways\n\n45:01.440 --> 45:03.520\n doing this very elaborate computation.\n\n45:03.520 --> 45:06.360\n It just happens to be a computation that right now,\n\n45:06.360 --> 45:09.560\n we haven't found ways to understand.\n\n45:09.560 --> 45:12.560\n We haven't found ways, our brains haven't,\n\n45:12.560 --> 45:14.960\n and our mathematics and our science and so on,\n\n45:14.960 --> 45:17.960\n haven't found ways to tell an interesting story about that.\n\n45:17.960 --> 45:19.560\n It just looks boring to us.\n\n45:19.560 --> 45:23.080\n So you're saying there's a hopeful view\n\n45:23.080 --> 45:26.320\n of the heat death, quote unquote, of the universe\n\n45:26.320 --> 45:30.400\n where there's actual beautiful complexity going on.\n\n45:30.400 --> 45:34.440\n Similar to the kind of complexity we think of\n\n45:34.440 --> 45:38.120\n that creates rich experience in human life and life on Earth.\n\n45:38.120 --> 45:40.720\n So those little molecules interacting complex ways,\n\n45:40.720 --> 45:43.320\n that could be intelligence in that, there could be.\n\n45:43.320 --> 45:44.160\n Absolutely.\n\n45:44.160 --> 45:46.120\n I mean, this is what you learn from this principle.\n\n45:46.120 --> 45:48.000\n Wow, that's a hopeful message.\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:48.840\n Right.\n\n45:48.840 --> 45:49.680\n I mean, this is what you kind of learn\n\n45:49.680 --> 45:51.720\n from this principle of computational equivalence.\n\n45:51.720 --> 45:56.200\n You learn it's both a message of sort of hope\n\n45:56.200 --> 45:59.040\n and a message of kind of, you know,\n\n45:59.040 --> 46:01.120\n you're not as special as you think you are, so to speak.\n\n46:01.120 --> 46:03.520\n I mean, because, you know, we imagine that\n\n46:03.520 --> 46:06.360\n with sort of all the things we do with human intelligence\n\n46:06.360 --> 46:07.640\n and all that kind of thing,\n\n46:07.640 --> 46:09.880\n and all of the stuff we've constructed in science,\n\n46:09.880 --> 46:12.000\n it's like, we're very special.\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:15.200\n But actually it turns out, well, no, we're not.\n\n46:15.200 --> 46:17.000\n We're just doing computations\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:19.480\n like things in nature do computations,\n\n46:19.480 --> 46:21.280\n like those gas molecules do computations,\n\n46:21.280 --> 46:23.280\n like the weather does computations.\n\n46:23.280 --> 46:26.120\n The only thing about the computations that we do\n\n46:26.120 --> 46:30.000\n that's really special is that we understand\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:31.160\n what they are, so to speak.\n\n46:31.160 --> 46:33.120\n In other words, we have a, you know,\n\n46:33.120 --> 46:35.320\n to us they're special because kind of,\n\n46:35.320 --> 46:37.040\n they're connected to our purposes,\n\n46:37.040 --> 46:39.160\n our ways of thinking about things and so on.\n\n46:39.160 --> 46:41.000\n And that's some, but so.\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:42.560\n That's very human centric.\n\n46:42.560 --> 46:45.520\n That's, we're just attached to this kind of thing.\n\n46:45.520 --> 46:48.280\n So let's talk a little bit of physics.\n\n46:48.280 --> 46:50.960\n Maybe let's ask the biggest question.\n\n46:50.960 --> 46:55.320\n What is a theory of everything in general?\n\n46:55.320 --> 46:56.160\n What does that mean?\n\n46:56.160 --> 46:58.000\n Yeah, so I mean, the question is,\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:01.720\n can we kind of reduce what has been physics\n\n47:01.720 --> 47:05.680\n as a something where we have to sort of pick away and say,\n\n47:05.680 --> 47:08.280\n do we roughly know how the world works\n\n47:08.280 --> 47:11.040\n to something where we have a complete formal theory\n\n47:11.040 --> 47:14.240\n where we say, if we were to run this program\n\n47:14.240 --> 47:17.680\n for long enough, we would reproduce everything,\n\n47:17.680 --> 47:19.600\n you know, down to the fact that we're having\n\n47:19.600 --> 47:21.160\n this conversation at this moment,\n\n47:21.160 --> 47:22.800\n et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n47:22.800 --> 47:25.480\n Any physical phenomena, any phenomena in this world?\n\n47:25.480 --> 47:27.040\n Any phenomenon in the universe.\n\n47:27.040 --> 47:30.320\n But the, you know, because of computational irreducibility,\n\n47:30.320 --> 47:33.720\n it's not, you know, that's not something where you say,\n\n47:33.720 --> 47:36.160\n okay, you've got the fundamental theory of everything.\n\n47:36.160 --> 47:39.920\n Then, you know, tell me whether, you know,\n\n47:39.920 --> 47:42.480\n lions are gonna eat tigers or something.\n\n47:42.480 --> 47:45.440\n You know, that's a, no, you have to run this thing\n\n47:45.440 --> 47:48.560\n for, you know, 10 to the 500 steps or something\n\n47:48.560 --> 47:50.800\n to know something like that, okay?\n\n47:50.800 --> 47:54.200\n So at some moment, potentially, you say,\n\n47:54.200 --> 47:57.560\n this is a rule and run this rule enough times\n\n47:57.560 --> 47:59.760\n and you will get the whole universe, right?\n\n47:59.760 --> 48:02.400\n That's what it means to kind of have\n\n48:02.400 --> 48:04.720\n a fundamental theory of physics as far as I'm concerned\n\n48:04.720 --> 48:06.600\n is you've got this rule.\n\n48:06.600 --> 48:07.720\n It's potentially quite simple.\n\n48:07.720 --> 48:09.360\n We don't know for sure it's simple,\n\n48:09.360 --> 48:12.560\n but we have various reasons to believe it might be simple.\n\n48:12.560 --> 48:15.800\n And then you say, okay, I'm showing you this rule.\n\n48:15.800 --> 48:18.720\n You just run it only 10 to the 500 times\n\n48:18.720 --> 48:20.080\n and you'll get everything.\n\n48:20.080 --> 48:22.800\n In other words, you've kind of reduced the problem\n\n48:22.800 --> 48:25.600\n of physics to a problem of mathematics, so to speak.\n\n48:25.600 --> 48:27.760\n It's like, it's as if, you know, you'd like,\n\n48:27.760 --> 48:29.760\n you generate the digits of pi.\n\n48:29.760 --> 48:30.920\n There's a definite procedure.\n\n48:30.920 --> 48:33.720\n You just generate them and it'd be the same thing\n\n48:33.720 --> 48:35.600\n if you have a fundamental theory of physics\n\n48:35.600 --> 48:38.640\n of the kind that I'm imagining, you know,\n\n48:38.640 --> 48:42.760\n you get this rule and you just run it out\n\n48:42.760 --> 48:45.880\n and you get everything that happens in the universe.\n\n48:45.880 --> 48:50.880\n So a theory of everything is a mathematical framework\n\n48:52.160 --> 48:55.360\n within which you can explain everything that happens\n\n48:55.360 --> 48:58.640\n in the universe, it's kind of in a unified way.\n\n48:58.640 --> 49:01.600\n It's not, there's a bunch of disparate modules of,\n\n49:01.600 --> 49:06.600\n does it feel like if you create a rule\n\n49:07.120 --> 49:11.200\n and we'll talk about the Wolfram physics model,\n\n49:11.200 --> 49:16.200\n which is fascinating, but if you have a simple set\n\n49:16.280 --> 49:20.880\n of rules with a data structure, like a hypergraph,\n\n49:21.840 --> 49:25.120\n does that feel like a satisfying theory of everything?\n\n49:25.120 --> 49:29.320\n Because then you really run up against the irreducibility,\n\n49:29.320 --> 49:32.360\n computational irreducibility.\n\n49:32.360 --> 49:34.240\n Right, so that's a really interesting question.\n\n49:34.240 --> 49:38.200\n So I, you know, what I thought was gonna happen\n\n49:38.200 --> 49:42.280\n is I thought we, you know, I thought we had a pretty good,\n\n49:42.280 --> 49:45.480\n I had a pretty good idea for what the structure\n\n49:45.480 --> 49:47.960\n of this sort of theory that sort of underneath space\n\n49:47.960 --> 49:50.200\n and time and so on might be like.\n\n49:50.200 --> 49:52.920\n And I thought, gosh, you know, in my lifetime,\n\n49:52.920 --> 49:55.040\n so to speak, we might be able to figure out what happens\n\n49:55.040 --> 49:58.160\n in the first 10 to the minus 100 seconds of the universe.\n\n49:58.160 --> 50:01.480\n And that would be cool, but it's pretty far away\n\n50:01.480 --> 50:03.840\n from anything that we can see today.\n\n50:03.840 --> 50:05.760\n And it will be hard to test whether that's right\n\n50:05.760 --> 50:07.520\n and so on and so on and so on.\n\n50:07.520 --> 50:10.480\n To my huge surprise, although it should have been obvious\n\n50:10.480 --> 50:12.600\n and it's embarrassing that it wasn't obvious to me,\n\n50:12.600 --> 50:15.600\n but to my huge surprise,\n\n50:15.600 --> 50:18.400\n we managed to get unbelievably much further than that.\n\n50:18.400 --> 50:21.520\n And basically what happened is that it turns out\n\n50:21.520 --> 50:23.160\n that even though there's this kind of bed\n\n50:23.160 --> 50:25.280\n of computational irreducibility,\n\n50:25.280 --> 50:30.040\n that sort of these, all these simple rules run into,\n\n50:30.040 --> 50:34.240\n there are certain pieces of computational reducibility\n\n50:34.240 --> 50:36.200\n that quite generically occur\n\n50:36.200 --> 50:38.400\n for large classes of these rules.\n\n50:38.400 --> 50:40.960\n And, and this is the really exciting thing\n\n50:40.960 --> 50:42.400\n as far as I'm concerned,\n\n50:42.400 --> 50:46.000\n the big pieces of computational reducibility\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:49.320\n are basically the pillars of 20th century physics.\n\n50:49.320 --> 50:50.280\n That's the amazing thing,\n\n50:50.280 --> 50:52.680\n that general relativity and quantum field theory\n\n50:52.680 --> 50:55.480\n is sort of the pillars of 20th century physics\n\n50:55.480 --> 50:59.720\n turn out to be precisely the stuff you can say.\n\n50:59.720 --> 51:00.840\n There's a lot you can't say,\n\n51:00.840 --> 51:03.360\n there's a lot that's kind of at this irreducible level\n\n51:03.360 --> 51:05.120\n where you kind of don't know what's going to happen,\n\n51:05.120 --> 51:06.400\n you have to run it, you know,\n\n51:06.400 --> 51:07.840\n you can't run it within our universe,\n\n51:07.840 --> 51:10.240\n et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n51:10.240 --> 51:13.560\n But the thing is there are things you can say\n\n51:13.560 --> 51:17.840\n and the things you can say turn out to be very beautifully\n\n51:17.840 --> 51:19.760\n exactly the structure that was found\n\n51:19.760 --> 51:21.520\n in 20th century physics,\n\n51:21.520 --> 51:24.040\n namely general relativity and quantum mechanics.\n\n51:24.040 --> 51:26.960\n And general relativity and quantum mechanics\n\n51:26.960 --> 51:30.520\n are these pockets of reducibility that we think of as,\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.120\n that 20th century physics\n\n51:34.120 --> 51:36.880\n is essentially pockets of reducibility.\n\n51:36.880 --> 51:39.400\n And then it is incredibly surprising\n\n51:39.400 --> 51:43.440\n that any kind of model that's generative\n\n51:43.440 --> 51:47.960\n from simple rules would have such pockets.\n\n51:47.960 --> 51:49.920\n Yeah, well, I think what's surprising\n\n51:49.920 --> 51:52.680\n is we didn't know where those things came from.\n\n51:52.680 --> 51:53.920\n It's like general relativity,\n\n51:53.920 --> 51:56.840\n it's a very nice mathematically elegant theory.\n\n51:56.840 --> 51:58.400\n Why is it true?\n\n51:58.400 --> 52:00.960\n You know, quantum mechanics, why is it true?\n\n52:00.960 --> 52:04.160\n What we realized is that from this,\n\n52:04.160 --> 52:07.080\n that these theories are generic\n\n52:07.080 --> 52:09.280\n to a huge class of systems\n\n52:09.280 --> 52:10.440\n that have these particular\n\n52:10.440 --> 52:13.480\n very unstructured underlying rules.\n\n52:13.480 --> 52:16.920\n And that's the thing that is sort of remarkable\n\n52:16.920 --> 52:18.280\n and that's the thing to me\n\n52:18.280 --> 52:20.320\n that's just, it's really beautiful.\n\n52:20.320 --> 52:22.800\n I mean, it's, and the thing that's even more beautiful\n\n52:22.800 --> 52:24.400\n is that it turns out that, you know,\n\n52:24.400 --> 52:26.120\n people have been struggling for a long time.\n\n52:26.120 --> 52:29.000\n You know, how does general relativity theory of gravity\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:30.080\n relate to quantum mechanics?\n\n52:30.080 --> 52:32.400\n They seem to have all kinds of incompatibilities.\n\n52:32.400 --> 52:34.400\n It turns out what we realized is\n\n52:34.400 --> 52:37.040\n at some level they are the same theory.\n\n52:37.040 --> 52:40.840\n And that's just, it's just great as far as I'm concerned.\n\n52:40.840 --> 52:43.160\n So maybe like taking a little step back\n\n52:43.160 --> 52:47.120\n from your perspective, not from the low,\n\n52:47.120 --> 52:50.680\n not from the beautiful hypergraph,\n\n52:50.680 --> 52:52.480\n well, from physics model perspective,\n\n52:52.480 --> 52:55.440\n but from the perspective of 20th century physics,\n\n52:55.440 --> 52:57.240\n what is general relativity?\n\n52:57.240 --> 52:58.320\n What is quantum mechanics?\n\n52:58.320 --> 53:00.880\n How do you think about these two theories\n\n53:00.880 --> 53:04.000\n from the context of the theory of everything?\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:05.720\n Like just even definition.\n\n53:05.720 --> 53:06.560\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.\n\n53:06.560 --> 53:08.800\n So I mean, you know, a little bit of history of physics,\n\n53:08.800 --> 53:09.640\n right?\n\n53:09.640 --> 53:12.040\n So, I mean the, you know, okay,\n\n53:12.040 --> 53:14.200\n very, very quick history of this, right?\n\n53:14.200 --> 53:16.240\n So, I mean, you know, physics, you know,\n\n53:16.240 --> 53:19.000\n in ancient Greek times, people basically said,\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:21.200\n we can just figure out how the world works.\n\n53:21.200 --> 53:22.560\n As you know, we're philosophers,\n\n53:22.560 --> 53:24.560\n we're gonna figure out how the world works.\n\n53:24.560 --> 53:26.600\n You know, some philosophers thought there were atoms.\n\n53:26.600 --> 53:28.600\n Some philosophers thought there were,\n\n53:28.600 --> 53:30.600\n you know, continuous flows of things.\n\n53:30.600 --> 53:33.000\n People had different ideas about how the world works.\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:33.840\n And they tried to just say,\n\n53:33.840 --> 53:36.840\n we're gonna construct this idea of how the world works.\n\n53:36.840 --> 53:38.200\n They didn't really have sort of notions\n\n53:38.200 --> 53:40.640\n of doing experiments and so on quite the same way\n\n53:40.640 --> 53:41.480\n as developed later.\n\n53:41.480 --> 53:43.320\n So that was sort of an early tradition\n\n53:43.320 --> 53:46.600\n for thinking about sort of models of the world.\n\n53:46.600 --> 53:51.200\n Then by the time of 1600s, time of Galileo and then Newton,\n\n53:51.200 --> 53:55.280\n sort of the big idea there was, you know,\n\n53:55.280 --> 53:57.640\n title of Newton's book, you know, Principia Mathematica,\n\n53:57.640 --> 54:00.440\n mathematical principles of natural philosophy.\n\n54:00.440 --> 54:04.240\n We can use mathematics to understand natural philosophy,\n\n54:04.240 --> 54:07.080\n to understand things about the way the world works.\n\n54:07.080 --> 54:10.480\n And so that then led to this kind of idea that, you know,\n\n54:10.480 --> 54:12.760\n we can write down a mathematical equation\n\n54:12.760 --> 54:14.960\n and have that represent how the world works.\n\n54:14.960 --> 54:16.800\n So Newton's one of his most famous ones\n\n54:16.800 --> 54:19.240\n is his universal law of gravity,\n\n54:19.240 --> 54:21.160\n inverse square law of gravity\n\n54:21.160 --> 54:23.360\n that allowed him to compute all sorts of features\n\n54:23.360 --> 54:24.920\n of the planets and so on.\n\n54:24.920 --> 54:26.240\n Although some of them he got wrong\n\n54:26.240 --> 54:28.000\n and it took another hundred years\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:30.200\n for people to actually be able to do the math\n\n54:30.200 --> 54:31.240\n to the level that was needed.\n\n54:31.240 --> 54:34.560\n But so that had been this sort of tradition\n\n54:34.560 --> 54:36.280\n was we write down these mathematical equations.\n\n54:36.280 --> 54:38.640\n We don't really know where these equations come from.\n\n54:38.640 --> 54:39.960\n We write them down.\n\n54:39.960 --> 54:42.480\n Then we figure out, we work out the consequences\n\n54:42.480 --> 54:45.320\n and we say, yes, that agrees with what we actually observe\n\n54:45.320 --> 54:47.320\n in astronomy or something like this.\n\n54:47.320 --> 54:49.480\n So that tradition continued.\n\n54:49.480 --> 54:51.440\n And then the first of these two\n\n54:51.440 --> 54:55.480\n sort of great 20th century innovations was,\n\n54:55.480 --> 54:57.320\n well, the history is actually a little bit more complicated,\n\n54:57.320 --> 55:01.600\n but let's say that there were two,\n\n55:01.600 --> 55:03.440\n quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n\n55:03.440 --> 55:05.400\n Quantum mechanics kind of 1900\n\n55:05.400 --> 55:08.400\n was kind of the very early stuff done by Planck\n\n55:08.400 --> 55:12.320\n that led to the idea of photons, particles of light.\n\n55:12.320 --> 55:14.880\n But let's take general relativity first.\n\n55:14.880 --> 55:19.240\n One feature of the story is that special relativity\n\n55:19.240 --> 55:21.800\n thing Einstein invented in 1905\n\n55:21.800 --> 55:24.240\n was something which surprisingly\n\n55:24.240 --> 55:27.040\n was a kind of logically invented theory.\n\n55:27.040 --> 55:29.880\n It was not a theory where it was something where\n\n55:29.880 --> 55:32.960\n given these ideas that were sort of axiomatically\n\n55:32.960 --> 55:34.760\n thought to be true about the world,\n\n55:34.760 --> 55:38.360\n it followed that such and such a thing would be the case.\n\n55:38.360 --> 55:39.400\n It was a little bit different\n\n55:39.400 --> 55:42.000\n from the kind of methodological structure\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:45.920\n of some existing theories in the more recent times,\n\n55:45.920 --> 55:47.640\n where it's just been, we write down an equation\n\n55:47.640 --> 55:49.960\n and we find out that it works.\n\n55:49.960 --> 55:51.560\n So what happened there.\n\n55:51.560 --> 55:53.680\n So there's some reasoning about the light.\n\n55:53.680 --> 55:57.720\n The basic idea was the speed of light\n\n55:57.720 --> 55:59.960\n appears to be constant.\n\n55:59.960 --> 56:01.920\n Even if you're traveling very fast,\n\n56:01.920 --> 56:05.080\n you shine a flashlight, the light will come out.\n\n56:05.080 --> 56:07.120\n Even if you're going at half the speed of light,\n\n56:07.120 --> 56:08.920\n the light doesn't come out of your flashlight\n\n56:08.920 --> 56:11.160\n at one and a half times the speed of light.\n\n56:11.160 --> 56:13.080\n It's still just the speed of light.\n\n56:13.080 --> 56:14.680\n And to make that work,\n\n56:14.680 --> 56:18.040\n you have to change your view of how space and time work\n\n56:18.040 --> 56:20.200\n to be able to account for the fact\n\n56:20.200 --> 56:21.480\n that when you're going faster,\n\n56:21.480 --> 56:24.440\n it appears that length is foreshortened\n\n56:24.440 --> 56:26.240\n and time is dilated and things like this.\n\n56:26.240 --> 56:27.200\n And that's special relativity.\n\n56:27.200 --> 56:28.560\n That's special relativity.\n\n56:28.560 --> 56:32.080\n So then Einstein went on with sort of\n\n56:33.160 --> 56:34.800\n vaguely similar kinds of thinking.\n\n56:34.800 --> 56:37.960\n In 1915, invented general relativity,\n\n56:37.960 --> 56:39.920\n which is the theory of gravity.\n\n56:39.920 --> 56:42.480\n And the basic point of general relativity\n\n56:42.480 --> 56:44.840\n is it's a theory that says,\n\n56:44.840 --> 56:49.680\n when there is mass in space, space is curved.\n\n56:49.680 --> 56:51.040\n And what does that mean?\n\n56:52.320 --> 56:55.160\n Usually you think of what's the shortest distance\n\n56:55.160 --> 56:56.000\n between two points.\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:59.920\n Like ordinarily on a plane in space, it's a straight line.\n\n57:00.840 --> 57:04.640\n Photons, light goes in straight lines.\n\n57:04.640 --> 57:06.440\n Well, then the question is,\n\n57:06.440 --> 57:10.280\n is if you have a curved surface,\n\n57:10.280 --> 57:12.160\n a straight line is no longer straight.\n\n57:12.160 --> 57:13.560\n On the surface of the earth,\n\n57:13.560 --> 57:16.200\n the shortest distance between two points is a great circle.\n\n57:16.200 --> 57:17.040\n It's a circle.\n\n57:18.600 --> 57:21.040\n So, you know, Einstein's observation was\n\n57:21.040 --> 57:24.520\n maybe the physical structure of space\n\n57:24.520 --> 57:26.800\n is such that space is curved.\n\n57:26.800 --> 57:29.640\n So the shortest distance between two points,\n\n57:29.640 --> 57:32.880\n the path, the straight line in quotes,\n\n57:32.880 --> 57:34.160\n won't be straight anymore.\n\n57:34.160 --> 57:37.160\n And in particular, if a photon is, you know,\n\n57:37.160 --> 57:39.320\n traveling near the sun or something,\n\n57:39.320 --> 57:40.600\n or if a particle is going,\n\n57:40.600 --> 57:42.400\n something is traveling near the sun,\n\n57:42.400 --> 57:45.320\n maybe the shortest path will be one\n\n57:45.320 --> 57:48.840\n that is something which looks curved to us\n\n57:48.840 --> 57:50.160\n because it seems curved to us\n\n57:50.160 --> 57:53.240\n because space has been deformed by the presence of mass\n\n57:53.240 --> 57:55.480\n associated with that massive object.\n\n57:55.480 --> 57:59.240\n So the kind of the idea there is,\n\n57:59.240 --> 58:01.000\n think of the structure of space\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.680\n as being a dynamical changing kind of thing.\n\n58:03.680 --> 58:04.840\n But then what Einstein did\n\n58:04.840 --> 58:07.120\n was he wrote down these differential equations\n\n58:07.120 --> 58:10.240\n that basically represented the curvature of space\n\n58:10.240 --> 58:13.040\n and its response to the presence of mass and energy.\n\n58:13.040 --> 58:18.040\n And that ultimately is connected to the force of gravity,\n\n58:18.280 --> 58:20.600\n which is one of the forces that seems to,\n\n58:20.600 --> 58:21.480\n based on its strength,\n\n58:21.480 --> 58:24.800\n operate on a different scale than some of the other forces.\n\n58:24.800 --> 58:27.760\n So it operates in a scale that's very large.\n\n58:27.760 --> 58:32.160\n What happens there is just this curvature of space,\n\n58:32.160 --> 58:35.960\n which causes, you know, the paths of objects to be deflected.\n\n58:35.960 --> 58:37.200\n That's what gravity does.\n\n58:37.200 --> 58:39.720\n It causes the paths of objects to be deflected.\n\n58:39.720 --> 58:43.160\n And this is an explanation for gravity, so to speak.\n\n58:43.160 --> 58:47.280\n And the surprise is that from 1915 until today,\n\n58:47.280 --> 58:49.680\n everything that we've measured about gravity\n\n58:49.680 --> 58:52.160\n precisely agrees with general relativity.\n\n58:52.160 --> 58:55.720\n And that, you know, it wasn't clear black holes\n\n58:55.720 --> 58:56.560\n were sort of a predict,\n\n58:56.560 --> 58:57.720\n well, actually the expansion of the universe\n\n58:57.720 --> 58:59.560\n was an early potential prediction,\n\n58:59.560 --> 59:02.720\n although Einstein tried to sort of patch up his equations\n\n59:02.720 --> 59:05.080\n to make it not cause the universe to expand,\n\n59:05.080 --> 59:06.320\n because it was kind of so obvious\n\n59:06.320 --> 59:08.160\n the universe wasn't expanding.\n\n59:08.160 --> 59:10.480\n And, you know, it turns out it was expanding\n\n59:10.480 --> 59:11.960\n and he should have just trusted the equations.\n\n59:11.960 --> 59:14.480\n And that's a lesson for those of us\n\n59:14.480 --> 59:16.680\n interested in making fundamental theories of physics\n\n59:16.680 --> 59:19.840\n is you should trust your theory and not try and patch it\n\n59:19.840 --> 59:22.000\n because of something that you think might be the case\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:25.280\n that might turn out not to be the case.\n\n59:25.280 --> 59:28.360\n Even if the theory says something crazy is happening.\n\n59:28.360 --> 59:29.200\n Yeah, right.\n\n59:29.200 --> 59:30.040\n Like the universe is expanding.\n\n59:30.040 --> 59:31.880\n Like the universe is expanding, right, which is,\n\n59:31.880 --> 59:35.160\n but, you know, then it took until the 1940s,\n\n59:35.160 --> 59:36.840\n probably even really until the 1960s,\n\n59:36.840 --> 59:38.600\n until people understood that black holes\n\n59:38.600 --> 59:42.200\n were a consequence of general relativity and so on.\n\n59:42.200 --> 59:45.640\n But that's, you know, the big surprise has been\n\n59:45.640 --> 59:50.000\n that so far this theory of gravity has perfectly agreed\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:51.880\n with, you know, these collisions of black holes\n\n59:51.880 --> 59:54.480\n seen by their gravitational waves, you know,\n\n59:54.480 --> 59:55.880\n it all just works.\n\n59:55.880 --> 59:59.160\n So that's been kind of one pillar of the story of physics\n\n59:59.160 --> 1:00:01.120\n it's mathematically complicated to work out\n\n1:00:01.120 --> 1:00:03.080\n the consequences of general relativity,\n\n1:00:03.080 --> 1:00:05.720\n but it's not, there's no, I mean,\n\n1:00:05.720 --> 1:00:09.400\n and some things are kind of squiggly and complicated.\n\n1:00:09.400 --> 1:00:12.120\n Like people believe, you know, energy is conserved.\n\n1:00:12.120 --> 1:00:14.480\n Okay, well, energy conservation doesn't really work\n\n1:00:14.480 --> 1:00:16.840\n in general activity in the same way as it ordinarily does.\n\n1:00:16.840 --> 1:00:19.300\n And it's all a big mathematical story\n\n1:00:19.300 --> 1:00:22.840\n of how you actually nail down something that is definitive\n\n1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:25.320\n that you can talk about it and not specific to the,\n\n1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:27.200\n you know, reference frames you're operating in\n\n1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:28.420\n and so on and so on and so on.\n\n1:00:28.420 --> 1:00:31.360\n But fundamentally, general relativity is a straight shot\n\n1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:32.960\n in the sense that you have this theory,\n\n1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:34.960\n you work out its consequences.\n\n1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:39.300\n And that theory is useful in terms of basic science\n\n1:00:39.300 --> 1:00:41.220\n and trying to understand the way black holes work,\n\n1:00:41.220 --> 1:00:43.580\n the way the creation of galaxies work,\n\n1:00:43.580 --> 1:00:45.840\n sort of all of these kinds of cosmological things,\n\n1:00:45.840 --> 1:00:49.200\n understanding what happened, like you said, at the Big Bang.\n\n1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:50.560\n Yeah. Like all those kinds of,\n\n1:00:50.560 --> 1:00:52.800\n well, no, not at the Big Bang actually, right?\n\n1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:53.860\n But the...\n\n1:00:53.860 --> 1:00:55.880\n Well, features of the expansion of the universe, yes.\n\n1:00:55.880 --> 1:00:58.220\n I mean, and there are lots of details\n\n1:00:58.220 --> 1:00:59.920\n where we don't quite know how it's working, you know,\n\n1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:02.040\n is there, you know, where's the dark matter,\n\n1:01:02.040 --> 1:01:04.400\n is there dark energy, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:06.320\n But fundamentally, the, you know,\n\n1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:08.440\n the testable features of general relativity,\n\n1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:10.080\n it all works very beautifully.\n\n1:01:10.080 --> 1:01:13.720\n And it's in a sense, it is mathematically sophisticated,\n\n1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:17.160\n but it is not conceptually hard to understand in some sense.\n\n1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:18.720\n Okay. So that's general relativity.\n\n1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:21.240\n And what's its friendly neighbor, like you said,\n\n1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:22.800\n there's two theories, quantum mechanics.\n\n1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:24.320\n Right. So quantum mechanics,\n\n1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:28.240\n the sort of the way that that originated was,\n\n1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:31.360\n one question was, is the world continuous or is it discrete?\n\n1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:32.480\n You know, in ancient Greek times,\n\n1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:34.000\n people have been debating this.\n\n1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.400\n People debated it, you know, throughout history.\n\n1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:38.360\n Is light made of waves?\n\n1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:39.820\n Is it continuous? Is it discrete?\n\n1:01:39.820 --> 1:01:43.380\n Is it made of particles, corpuscles, whatever.\n\n1:01:43.380 --> 1:01:47.760\n You know, what had become clear in the 1800s is that atoms,\n\n1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:51.360\n that, you know, materials are made of discrete atoms.\n\n1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:53.940\n You know, when you take some water,\n\n1:01:53.940 --> 1:01:55.560\n the water is not a continuous fluid,\n\n1:01:55.560 --> 1:01:57.360\n even though it seems like a continuous fluid\n\n1:01:57.360 --> 1:01:58.880\n to us at our scale.\n\n1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:00.760\n But if you say, let's look at it,\n\n1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:02.480\n smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller scale,\n\n1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:04.400\n eventually you get down to these, you know,\n\n1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:06.320\n these molecules and then atoms.\n\n1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:07.960\n It's made of discrete things.\n\n1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:10.960\n The question is sort of how important is this discreteness?\n\n1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:12.900\n Just what's discrete, what's not discrete?\n\n1:02:12.900 --> 1:02:14.040\n Is energy discrete?\n\n1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:17.400\n Is, you know, what's discrete, what's not?\n\n1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:18.240\n And so.\n\n1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:19.560\n Does it have mass?\n\n1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:20.880\n Those kinds of questions.\n\n1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:21.700\n Yeah, yeah, right.\n\n1:02:21.700 --> 1:02:23.640\n Well, there's a question, I mean, for example,\n\n1:02:23.640 --> 1:02:26.040\n is mass discrete is an interesting question,\n\n1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:28.140\n which is now something we can address.\n\n1:02:28.140 --> 1:02:33.140\n But, you know, what happened in the coming up to the 1920s,\n\n1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:37.720\n there was this kind of mathematical theory developed\n\n1:02:37.720 --> 1:02:40.500\n that could explain certain kinds of discreteness\n\n1:02:40.500 --> 1:02:44.340\n in particularly in features of atoms and so on.\n\n1:02:44.340 --> 1:02:47.780\n And, you know, what developed was this mathematical theory\n\n1:02:47.780 --> 1:02:50.200\n that was the theory of quantum mechanics,\n\n1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:52.520\n theory of wave functions, Schrodinger's equation,\n\n1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:53.680\n things like this.\n\n1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:57.320\n That's a mathematical theory that allows you to calculate\n\n1:02:57.320 --> 1:02:59.260\n lots of features of the microscopic world,\n\n1:02:59.260 --> 1:03:01.480\n lots of things about how atoms work,\n\n1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:03.000\n et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.760\n Now, the calculations all work just great.\n\n1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:09.400\n The question of what does it really mean\n\n1:03:09.400 --> 1:03:11.300\n is a complicated question.\n\n1:03:11.300 --> 1:03:14.280\n Now, I mean, to just explain a little bit historically,\n\n1:03:14.280 --> 1:03:17.040\n the, you know, the early calculations of things like atoms\n\n1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:20.320\n worked great in 1920s, 1930s and so on.\n\n1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:21.400\n There was always a problem.\n\n1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:24.200\n There were, in quantum field theory,\n\n1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:27.300\n which is a theory of, in quantum mechanics,\n\n1:03:27.300 --> 1:03:30.480\n you're dealing with a certain number of electrons\n\n1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:31.940\n and you fix the number of electrons.\n\n1:03:31.940 --> 1:03:34.900\n You say, I'm dealing with a two electron thing.\n\n1:03:34.900 --> 1:03:35.800\n In quantum field theory,\n\n1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:38.880\n you allow for particles being created and destroyed.\n\n1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:41.200\n So you can emit a photon that didn't exist before.\n\n1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:43.440\n You can absorb a photon, things like that.\n\n1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:44.560\n That's a more complicated,\n\n1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:46.280\n mathematically complicated theory.\n\n1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:47.960\n And it had all kinds of mathematical issues\n\n1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:49.980\n and all kinds of infinities that cropped up.\n\n1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:51.400\n And it was finally figured out more or less\n\n1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:52.920\n how to get rid of those.\n\n1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:55.940\n But there were only certain ways of doing the calculations\n\n1:03:55.940 --> 1:03:59.640\n and those didn't work for atomic nuclei among other things.\n\n1:03:59.640 --> 1:04:03.840\n And that led to a lot of development up until the 1960s\n\n1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:07.160\n of alternative ideas for how one could understand\n\n1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:09.080\n what was happening in atomic nuclei, et cetera,\n\n1:04:09.080 --> 1:04:10.120\n et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:12.280\n End result, in the end,\n\n1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:16.000\n the kind of most quotes obvious mathematical structure\n\n1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.360\n of quantum field theory seems to work.\n\n1:04:18.360 --> 1:04:20.680\n Although it's mathematically difficult to deal with,\n\n1:04:20.680 --> 1:04:22.980\n but you can calculate all kinds of things.\n\n1:04:22.980 --> 1:04:26.140\n You can calculate to a dozen decimal places,\n\n1:04:26.140 --> 1:04:27.800\n certain things, you can measure them.\n\n1:04:27.800 --> 1:04:28.640\n It all works.\n\n1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:29.600\n It's all beautiful.\n\n1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:30.440\n Now you say...\n\n1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:32.520\n The underlying fabric is the model\n\n1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:34.800\n of that particular theory is fields.\n\n1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:37.000\n Like you keep saying fields.\n\n1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:37.940\n Those are quantum fields.\n\n1:04:37.940 --> 1:04:40.400\n Those are different from classical fields.\n\n1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:43.400\n A field is something like you say,\n\n1:04:44.640 --> 1:04:46.920\n like you say the temperature field in this room.\n\n1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:49.520\n It's like there is a value of temperature\n\n1:04:49.520 --> 1:04:51.360\n at every point around the room.\n\n1:04:51.360 --> 1:04:53.980\n That's some, or you can say the wind field\n\n1:04:53.980 --> 1:04:56.920\n would be the vector direction of the wind at every point.\n\n1:04:56.920 --> 1:04:57.880\n It's continuous.\n\n1:04:57.880 --> 1:05:00.200\n Yes, and that's a classical field.\n\n1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:01.360\n The quantum field is a much more\n\n1:05:01.360 --> 1:05:04.280\n mathematically elaborate kind of thing.\n\n1:05:04.280 --> 1:05:06.400\n And I should explain that one of the pictures\n\n1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:09.360\n of quantum mechanics that's really important is,\n\n1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:11.760\n in classical physics, one believes\n\n1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:13.800\n that sort of definite things happen in the world.\n\n1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:16.160\n You pick up a ball, you throw it,\n\n1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:17.980\n the ball goes in a definite trajectory\n\n1:05:17.980 --> 1:05:20.200\n that has certain equations of motion.\n\n1:05:20.200 --> 1:05:22.240\n It goes in a parabola, whatever else.\n\n1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:25.320\n In quantum mechanics, the picture is\n\n1:05:25.320 --> 1:05:26.880\n definite things don't happen.\n\n1:05:26.880 --> 1:05:29.720\n Instead, sort of what happens is this whole\n\n1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:34.720\n sort of structure of all many different paths being followed\n\n1:05:34.840 --> 1:05:37.840\n and we can calculate certain aspects of what happens,\n\n1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:40.560\n certain probabilities of different outcomes and so on.\n\n1:05:40.560 --> 1:05:42.440\n And you say, well, what really happened?\n\n1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:43.440\n What's really going on?\n\n1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:45.680\n What's the sort of, what's the underlying,\n\n1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:47.120\n what's the underlying story?\n\n1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:50.640\n How do we turn this mathematical theory\n\n1:05:50.640 --> 1:05:52.400\n that we can calculate things with\n\n1:05:52.400 --> 1:05:54.760\n into something that we can really understand\n\n1:05:54.760 --> 1:05:56.360\n and have a narrative about?\n\n1:05:56.360 --> 1:05:58.920\n And that's been really, really hard for quantum mechanics.\n\n1:05:58.920 --> 1:06:01.500\n My friend, Dick Feynman, always used to say,\n\n1:06:01.500 --> 1:06:03.640\n nobody understands quantum mechanics,\n\n1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:06.400\n even though he'd made his whole career\n\n1:06:06.400 --> 1:06:10.160\n out of calculating things about quantum mechanics.\n\n1:06:10.160 --> 1:06:11.720\n And so it's a little bit.\n\n1:06:11.720 --> 1:06:16.720\n Nevertheless, it's what the quantum field theory is very,\n\n1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:20.640\n very accurate at predicting a lot of the physical phenomena.\n\n1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:21.720\n So it works.\n\n1:06:21.720 --> 1:06:22.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:25.240\n But there are things about it, it has certain,\n\n1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:27.780\n when we apply it, the standard model of particle physics,\n\n1:06:27.780 --> 1:06:31.500\n for example, we, which we apply to calculate\n\n1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:33.440\n all kinds of things that works really well.\n\n1:06:33.440 --> 1:06:34.880\n And you say, well, it has certain parameters.\n\n1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:36.900\n It has a whole bunch of parameters actually.\n\n1:06:36.900 --> 1:06:41.540\n You say, why is the, why does the muon particle exist?\n\n1:06:41.540 --> 1:06:44.880\n Why is it 206 times the mass of the electron?\n\n1:06:44.880 --> 1:06:46.680\n We don't know, no idea.\n\n1:06:46.680 --> 1:06:50.020\n But so the standard model of physics is one of the models\n\n1:06:50.020 --> 1:06:51.720\n that's very accurate for describing\n\n1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:55.200\n three of the fundamental forces of physics.\n\n1:06:55.200 --> 1:06:58.240\n And it's looking at the world of the very small.\n\n1:06:58.240 --> 1:06:59.080\n Right.\n\n1:06:59.080 --> 1:07:03.140\n And then there's back to the neighbor of gravity,\n\n1:07:03.140 --> 1:07:04.760\n of general relativity.\n\n1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:07.660\n So, and then in the context of a theory of everything,\n\n1:07:07.660 --> 1:07:12.660\n what's traditionally the task of the unification\n\n1:07:13.560 --> 1:07:15.160\n of these theories?\n\n1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:16.000\n And why is it hard?\n\n1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:18.160\n The issue is you try to use the methods\n\n1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:20.840\n of quantum field theory to talk about gravity\n\n1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:22.000\n and it doesn't work.\n\n1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000\n Just like there are photons of light.\n\n1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:25.320\n So there are gravitons,\n\n1:07:25.320 --> 1:07:27.960\n which are sort of the particles of gravity.\n\n1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:30.280\n And when you try and compute sort of the properties\n\n1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:32.680\n of the particles of gravity,\n\n1:07:32.680 --> 1:07:36.040\n the kind of mathematical tricks that get used\n\n1:07:36.040 --> 1:07:39.280\n in working things out in quantum field theory don't work.\n\n1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:43.000\n And that's, so that's been a sort of fundamental issue.\n\n1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:44.800\n And when you think about black holes,\n\n1:07:44.800 --> 1:07:48.960\n which are a place where sort of the structure of space\n\n1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:52.800\n is, you know, has sort of rapid variation\n\n1:07:52.800 --> 1:07:55.320\n and you get kind of quantum effects mixed in\n\n1:07:55.320 --> 1:07:57.520\n with effects from general relativity,\n\n1:07:57.520 --> 1:07:58.720\n things get very complicated\n\n1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:01.320\n and there are apparent paradoxes and things like that.\n\n1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:02.840\n And people have, you know,\n\n1:08:02.840 --> 1:08:05.040\n there've been a bunch of mathematical developments\n\n1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:08.600\n in physics over the last, I don't know, 30 years or so,\n\n1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:11.560\n which have kind of picked away at those kinds of issues\n\n1:08:11.560 --> 1:08:14.000\n and got hints about how things might work.\n\n1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:17.280\n But it hasn't been, you know,\n\n1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:19.040\n and the other thing to realize is,\n\n1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:20.680\n as far as physics is concerned,\n\n1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:22.840\n it's just like here's general relativity,\n\n1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:25.840\n here's quantum field theory, you know, be happy.\n\n1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:28.760\n Yeah, so do you think there's a quantization of gravity,\n\n1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:31.100\n so quantum gravity, what do you think of efforts\n\n1:08:31.100 --> 1:08:33.760\n that people have tried to, yeah,\n\n1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:36.340\n what do you think in general of the efforts\n\n1:08:36.340 --> 1:08:39.600\n of the physics community to try to unify these laws?\n\n1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:41.320\n So I think what's, it's interesting.\n\n1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:43.360\n I mean, I would have said something very different\n\n1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:46.400\n before what's happened with our physics project.\n\n1:08:46.400 --> 1:08:48.880\n I mean, you know, the remarkable thing is\n\n1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:51.720\n what we've been able to do is to make\n\n1:08:51.720 --> 1:08:55.560\n from this very simple, structurally simple,\n\n1:08:55.560 --> 1:08:57.960\n underlying set of ideas,\n\n1:08:57.960 --> 1:09:00.940\n we've been able to build this, you know,\n\n1:09:00.940 --> 1:09:04.480\n very elaborate structure that's both very abstract\n\n1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:06.880\n and very sort of mathematically rich.\n\n1:09:06.880 --> 1:09:09.240\n And the big surprise, as far as I'm concerned,\n\n1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:12.960\n is that it touches many of the ideas that people have had.\n\n1:09:12.960 --> 1:09:15.520\n So in other words, things like string theory and so on,\n\n1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:18.160\n twister theory, it's like the, you know,\n\n1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:21.020\n we might've thought, I had thought we're out on a prong,\n\n1:09:21.020 --> 1:09:22.640\n we're building something that's computational,\n\n1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:25.060\n it's completely different from what other people have done.\n\n1:09:25.060 --> 1:09:27.320\n But actually it seems like what we've done\n\n1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:30.820\n is to provide essentially the machine code that, you know,\n\n1:09:30.820 --> 1:09:33.080\n these things are various features\n\n1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:35.460\n of domain specific languages, so to speak,\n\n1:09:35.460 --> 1:09:37.920\n that talk about various aspects of this machine code.\n\n1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:41.800\n And I think this is something that to me is very exciting\n\n1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:45.540\n because it allows one both for us to provide\n\n1:09:45.540 --> 1:09:48.440\n sort of a new foundation for what's been thought about there\n\n1:09:48.440 --> 1:09:52.000\n and for all the work that's been done in those areas\n\n1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:55.760\n to give us, you know, more momentum\n\n1:09:55.760 --> 1:09:57.140\n to be able to figure out what's going on.\n\n1:09:57.140 --> 1:09:58.840\n Now, you know, people have sort of hoped,\n\n1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:01.200\n oh, we're just gonna be able to get, you know,\n\n1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:03.400\n string theory to just answer everything.\n\n1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:04.920\n That hasn't worked out.\n\n1:10:04.920 --> 1:10:07.920\n And I think we now kind of can see a little bit about\n\n1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:10.360\n just sort of how far away certain kinds of things are\n\n1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:12.520\n from being able to explain things.\n\n1:10:12.520 --> 1:10:14.720\n Some things, one of the big surprises to me,\n\n1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:16.600\n actually I literally just got a message\n\n1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:20.800\n about one aspect of this is the, you know,\n\n1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:22.640\n it's turning out to be easier.\n\n1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:24.880\n I mean, this project has been so much easier\n\n1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:26.680\n than I could ever imagine it would be.\n\n1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:29.720\n That is, I thought we would be, you know,\n\n1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:31.360\n just about able to understand\n\n1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:34.120\n the first 10 to the minus 100 seconds of the universe.\n\n1:10:34.120 --> 1:10:35.800\n And, you know, it would be a hundred years\n\n1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:37.640\n before we get much further than that.\n\n1:10:37.640 --> 1:10:40.440\n It's just turned out, it actually wasn't that hard.\n\n1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:42.480\n I mean, we're not finished, but, you know.\n\n1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:45.840\n So you're seeing echoes of all the disparate theories\n\n1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:47.400\n of physics in this framework.\n\n1:10:47.400 --> 1:10:48.440\n Yes, yes.\n\n1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:50.840\n I mean, it's a very interesting, you know,\n\n1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:53.300\n sort of history of science like phenomenon.\n\n1:10:53.300 --> 1:10:55.920\n I mean, the best analogy that I can see\n\n1:10:55.920 --> 1:10:58.240\n is what happened with the early days\n\n1:10:58.240 --> 1:11:00.600\n of computability and computation theory.\n\n1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:03.520\n You know, Turing machines were invented in 1936.\n\n1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:06.040\n People sort of understand computation\n\n1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:07.280\n in terms of Turing machines,\n\n1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:09.920\n but actually there had been preexisting theories\n\n1:11:09.920 --> 1:11:12.920\n of computation, combinators, general recursive functions,\n\n1:11:12.920 --> 1:11:14.880\n Lambda calculus, things like this.\n\n1:11:14.880 --> 1:11:18.280\n But people hadn't, those hadn't been concrete enough\n\n1:11:18.280 --> 1:11:20.320\n that people could really wrap their arms around them\n\n1:11:20.320 --> 1:11:21.800\n and understand what was going on.\n\n1:11:21.800 --> 1:11:23.480\n And I think what we're gonna see in this case\n\n1:11:23.480 --> 1:11:26.000\n is that a bunch of these mathematical theories,\n\n1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.080\n including some very,\n\n1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:29.720\n I mean, one of the things that's really interesting\n\n1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:31.840\n is one of the most abstract things\n\n1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:36.240\n that's come out of sort of mathematics,\n\n1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:39.680\n higher category theory, things about infinity group voids,\n\n1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:41.640\n things like this, which to me always just seemed\n\n1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:44.160\n like they were floating off into the stratosphere,\n\n1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:48.300\n ionosphere of mathematics, turn out to be things\n\n1:11:48.300 --> 1:11:52.000\n which our sort of theory anchors down\n\n1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.240\n to something fairly definite and says are super relevant\n\n1:11:56.240 --> 1:11:59.240\n to the way that we can understand how physics works.\n\n1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:00.080\n Give me a sec.\n\n1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:01.560\n By the way, I just threw a hat on.\n\n1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:06.400\n You've said that with this metaphor analogy\n\n1:12:06.400 --> 1:12:09.360\n that the theory of everything is a big mountain\n\n1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:14.360\n and you have a sense that however far we are up the mountain,\n\n1:12:14.360 --> 1:12:19.360\n that the Wolfram physics model view of the universe\n\n1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:22.600\n is at least the right mountain.\n\n1:12:22.600 --> 1:12:25.440\n We're the right mountain, yes, without question.\n\n1:12:25.440 --> 1:12:27.880\n Which aspect of it is the right mountain?\n\n1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:31.000\n So for example, I mean, so there's so many aspects\n\n1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:34.560\n to just the way of the Wolfram physics project,\n\n1:12:34.560 --> 1:12:39.560\n the way it approaches the world that's clean, crisp,\n\n1:12:39.560 --> 1:12:44.560\n and unique and powerful, so there's a discreet nature to it,\n\n1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:48.960\n there's a hypergraph, there's a computational nature,\n\n1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:51.600\n there's a generative aspect, you start from nothing,\n\n1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:56.600\n you generate everything, do you think the actual model\n\n1:12:56.920 --> 1:12:58.320\n is actually a really good one,\n\n1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:00.160\n or do you think this general principle\n\n1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:02.880\n from simplicity generating complexity is the right,\n\n1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:05.040\n like what aspect of the mountain is the correct?\n\n1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:10.040\n Yeah, right, I think that the kind of the meta idea\n\n1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:14.080\n about using simple computational systems to do things,\n\n1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:18.080\n that's the ultimate big paradigm\n\n1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:21.560\n that is sort of super important.\n\n1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:25.560\n The details of the particular model are very nice and clean\n\n1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:27.880\n and allow one to actually understand what's going on.\n\n1:13:27.880 --> 1:13:30.600\n They are not unique, and in fact, we know that.\n\n1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:34.680\n We know that there's a very, very, very, very,\n\n1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:37.160\n there's a large number of different ways\n\n1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:38.600\n to describe essentially the same thing.\n\n1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:41.120\n I mean, I can describe things in terms of hypergraphs,\n\n1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:43.520\n I can describe them in terms of higher category theory,\n\n1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:45.240\n I can describe them in a bunch of different ways.\n\n1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:47.480\n They are in some sense all the same thing,\n\n1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:50.240\n but our sort of story about what's going on\n\n1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:53.600\n and the kind of cultural mathematical resonances\n\n1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:54.720\n are a bit different.\n\n1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:57.600\n And I think it's perhaps worth sort of saying a little bit\n\n1:13:57.600 --> 1:14:00.600\n about kind of the foundational ideas\n\n1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:04.800\n of these models and things.\n\n1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:09.800\n Great, so can you maybe, can we like rewind?\n\n1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:11.120\n We've talked about it a little bit,\n\n1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:14.080\n but can you say like what the central idea is\n\n1:14:14.080 --> 1:14:16.680\n of the Wolfram Physics Project?\n\n1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:19.200\n Right, so the question is we're interested\n\n1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:21.920\n in finding sort of simple computational rule\n\n1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:24.040\n that describes our whole universe.\n\n1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:25.480\n Can we just pause on that?\n\n1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:30.480\n It's just so beautiful, that's such a beautiful idea\n\n1:14:30.920 --> 1:14:32.440\n that we can generate our universe\n\n1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:37.440\n from a data structure, a simple structure,\n\n1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:42.680\n simple set of rules, and we can generate our entire universe.\n\n1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:44.840\n Yes, that's the idea. That's awe inspiring.\n\n1:14:44.840 --> 1:14:49.840\n Right, but so the question is how do you actualize that?\n\n1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:52.560\n What might this rule be like?\n\n1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:55.160\n And so one thing you quickly realize is\n\n1:14:55.160 --> 1:14:57.200\n if you're gonna pack everything about our universe\n\n1:14:57.200 --> 1:15:01.240\n into this tiny rule, not much that we are familiar with\n\n1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:04.000\n in our universe will be obvious in that rule.\n\n1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.920\n So you don't get to fit all these parameters of the universe,\n\n1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:10.080\n all these features of, you know, this is how space works,\n\n1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:12.000\n this is how time works, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:13.080\n You don't get to fit that all in.\n\n1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:16.680\n It all has to be sort of packed in to this thing,\n\n1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:18.640\n something much smaller, much more basic,\n\n1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:22.040\n much lower level machine code, so to speak, than that.\n\n1:15:22.040 --> 1:15:23.520\n And all the stuff that we're familiar with\n\n1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:26.240\n has to kind of emerge from the operation.\n\n1:15:26.240 --> 1:15:27.840\n So the rule in itself,\n\n1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:30.440\n because of the computational reducibility,\n\n1:15:30.440 --> 1:15:32.320\n is not gonna tell you the story.\n\n1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:35.680\n It's not gonna give you the answer to,\n\n1:15:36.600 --> 1:15:38.360\n it's not gonna let you predict\n\n1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:40.600\n what you're gonna have for lunch tomorrow,\n\n1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:42.160\n and it's not going to let you predict\n\n1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:44.800\n basically anything about your life, about the universe.\n\n1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:47.880\n Right, and you're not going to be able to see in that rule,\n\n1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:49.160\n oh, there's the three\n\n1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:51.240\n for the number of dimensions of space and so on.\n\n1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:52.080\n That's not gonna be there.\n\n1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:54.560\n Spacetime is not going to be obviously.\n\n1:15:54.560 --> 1:15:55.720\n Right, so the question is then,\n\n1:15:55.720 --> 1:15:57.760\n what is the universe made of?\n\n1:15:57.760 --> 1:16:00.200\n That's a basic question.\n\n1:16:00.200 --> 1:16:01.640\n And we've had some assumptions\n\n1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:02.960\n about what the universe is made of\n\n1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:04.840\n for the last few thousand years\n\n1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:08.680\n that I think in some cases just turn out not to be right.\n\n1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:11.040\n And the most important assumption\n\n1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:13.960\n is that space is a continuous thing.\n\n1:16:13.960 --> 1:16:17.040\n That is that you can, if you say,\n\n1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:19.200\n let's pick a point in space.\n\n1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:20.120\n We're gonna do geometry.\n\n1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:21.520\n We're gonna pick a point.\n\n1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:24.320\n We can pick a point absolutely anywhere in space.\n\n1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:28.080\n Precise numbers we can specify of where that point is.\n\n1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:30.320\n In fact, Euclid who kind of wrote down\n\n1:16:30.320 --> 1:16:32.960\n the original kind of axiomatization of geometry\n\n1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:34.800\n back in 300 BC or so,\n\n1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:38.320\n his very first definition, he says,\n\n1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:40.640\n a point is that which has no part.\n\n1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:45.640\n A point is this indivisible infinitesimal thing.\n\n1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:50.440\n Okay, so we might've said that about material objects.\n\n1:16:50.440 --> 1:16:52.880\n We might've said that about water, for example.\n\n1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:54.800\n We might've said water is a continuous thing\n\n1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:59.160\n that we can just pick any point we want in some water,\n\n1:16:59.160 --> 1:17:00.760\n but actually we know it isn't true.\n\n1:17:00.760 --> 1:17:04.120\n We know that water is made of molecules that are discrete.\n\n1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:06.560\n And so the question, one fundamental question\n\n1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:08.360\n is what is space made of?\n\n1:17:08.360 --> 1:17:10.880\n And so one of the things that's sort of a starting point\n\n1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:15.600\n for what I've done is to think of space as a discrete thing,\n\n1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:18.560\n to think of there being sort of atoms of space\n\n1:17:18.560 --> 1:17:20.600\n just as there are atoms of material things,\n\n1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:23.120\n although very different kinds of atoms.\n\n1:17:23.120 --> 1:17:25.000\n And by the way, I mean, this idea,\n\n1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.200\n you know, there were ancient Greek philosophers\n\n1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:28.360\n who had this idea.\n\n1:17:28.360 --> 1:17:30.280\n There were, you know, Einstein actually thought\n\n1:17:30.280 --> 1:17:31.840\n this is probably how things would work out.\n\n1:17:31.840 --> 1:17:34.320\n I mean, he said, you know, repeatedly he thought\n\n1:17:34.320 --> 1:17:35.520\n that's the way it would work out.\n\n1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:38.680\n We don't have the mathematical tools in our time,\n\n1:17:38.680 --> 1:17:42.520\n which was 1940s, 1950s and so on to explore this.\n\n1:17:42.520 --> 1:17:44.120\n Like the way he thought,\n\n1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:48.280\n you mean that there is something very, very small\n\n1:17:48.280 --> 1:17:52.240\n and discrete that's underlying space.\n\n1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:53.080\n Yes.\n\n1:17:53.080 --> 1:17:56.600\n And that means that, so, you know, the mathematical theory,\n\n1:17:56.600 --> 1:17:59.960\n mathematical theories in physics assume that space\n\n1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:02.400\n can be described just as a continuous thing.\n\n1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:04.000\n You can just pick coordinates\n\n1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000\n and the coordinates can have any values.\n\n1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:07.840\n And that's how you define space.\n\n1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:11.680\n Space is this just sort of background sort of theater\n\n1:18:11.680 --> 1:18:13.600\n on which the universe operates.\n\n1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:17.240\n But can we draw a distinction between space\n\n1:18:17.240 --> 1:18:22.240\n as a thing that could be described by three values,\n\n1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:25.400\n coordinates, and how you're,\n\n1:18:25.400 --> 1:18:29.320\n are you using the word space more generally when you say?\n\n1:18:29.320 --> 1:18:30.960\n No, I'm just talking about space\n\n1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:34.320\n as in what we experience in the universe.\n\n1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:38.440\n So that you think this 3D aspect of it is fundamental.\n\n1:18:38.440 --> 1:18:40.840\n No, I don't think that 3D is fundamental at all, actually.\n\n1:18:40.840 --> 1:18:45.160\n I think that the thing that has been assumed\n\n1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:48.200\n is that space is this continuous thing\n\n1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:49.480\n where you can just describe it by,\n\n1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:51.320\n let's say three numbers, for instance.\n\n1:18:51.320 --> 1:18:53.160\n But most important thing about that\n\n1:18:53.160 --> 1:18:56.080\n is that you can describe it by precise numbers\n\n1:18:56.080 --> 1:18:58.200\n because you can pick any point in space\n\n1:18:58.200 --> 1:18:59.640\n and you can talk about motions,\n\n1:18:59.640 --> 1:19:01.800\n any infinitesimal motion in space.\n\n1:19:01.800 --> 1:19:03.320\n And that's what continuous means.\n\n1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:04.240\n That's what continuous means.\n\n1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:06.120\n That's what, you know, Newton invented calculus\n\n1:19:06.120 --> 1:19:08.600\n to describe these kind of continuous small variations\n\n1:19:08.600 --> 1:19:09.440\n and so on.\n\n1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:11.400\n That was, that's kind of a fundamental idea\n\n1:19:11.400 --> 1:19:15.360\n from Euclid on that's been a fundamental idea about space.\n\n1:19:15.360 --> 1:19:16.200\n And so.\n\n1:19:16.200 --> 1:19:17.520\n Is that right or wrong?\n\n1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:20.000\n It's not right.\n\n1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:20.960\n It's not right.\n\n1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:25.720\n It's right at the level of our experience most of the time.\n\n1:19:25.720 --> 1:19:27.760\n It's not right at the level of the machine code,\n\n1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:28.920\n so to speak.\n\n1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:29.760\n And so.\n\n1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:31.040\n Machine code.\n\n1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:32.200\n Yeah, of the simulation.\n\n1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:33.040\n That's right.\n\n1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:33.880\n That's right.\n\n1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:36.960\n They're the very lowest level of the fabric of the universe,\n\n1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:41.960\n at least under the Wolfram physics model\n\n1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:44.240\n is your senses is discrete.\n\n1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:45.080\n Right.\n\n1:19:45.080 --> 1:19:46.320\n So now what does that mean?\n\n1:19:46.320 --> 1:19:49.160\n So it means what is space then?\n\n1:19:49.160 --> 1:19:54.160\n So in models, the basic idea is you say\n\n1:19:54.160 --> 1:19:56.400\n there are these sort of atoms of space.\n\n1:19:56.400 --> 1:19:59.080\n They're these points that represent,\n\n1:19:59.080 --> 1:20:02.040\n you know, represent places in space,\n\n1:20:02.040 --> 1:20:03.960\n but they're just discrete points.\n\n1:20:03.960 --> 1:20:06.120\n And the only thing we know about them\n\n1:20:06.120 --> 1:20:08.000\n is how they're connected to each other.\n\n1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:09.480\n We don't know where they are.\n\n1:20:09.480 --> 1:20:10.520\n They don't have coordinates.\n\n1:20:10.520 --> 1:20:12.920\n We don't get to say this is a position, such and such.\n\n1:20:12.920 --> 1:20:15.280\n It's just, here's a big bag of points.\n\n1:20:15.280 --> 1:20:16.120\n Like in our universe,\n\n1:20:16.120 --> 1:20:18.440\n there might be 10 to the 100 of these points.\n\n1:20:18.440 --> 1:20:21.640\n And all we know is this point is connected\n\n1:20:21.640 --> 1:20:22.480\n to this other point.\n\n1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:23.480\n So it's like, you know,\n\n1:20:23.480 --> 1:20:25.560\n all we have is the friend network, so to speak.\n\n1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:27.960\n We don't have, you know, people's, you know,\n\n1:20:27.960 --> 1:20:29.120\n physical addresses.\n\n1:20:29.120 --> 1:20:31.560\n All we have is the friend network of these points.\n\n1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:32.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:32.400 --> 1:20:35.240\n The underlying nature of reality is kind of like a Facebook.\n\n1:20:35.240 --> 1:20:37.240\n We don't know their location, but we have the friends.\n\n1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:38.080\n Yeah, yeah, right.\n\n1:20:38.080 --> 1:20:41.960\n We know which point is connected to which other points.\n\n1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:43.480\n And that's all we know.\n\n1:20:43.480 --> 1:20:44.320\n And so you might say, well,\n\n1:20:44.320 --> 1:20:46.040\n how on earth can you get something\n\n1:20:46.040 --> 1:20:49.200\n which is like our experience of, you know,\n\n1:20:49.200 --> 1:20:50.560\n what seems like continuous space?\n\n1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:51.640\n Well, the answer is,\n\n1:20:51.640 --> 1:20:54.520\n by the time you have 10 to the 100 of these things,\n\n1:20:54.520 --> 1:20:57.840\n those connections can work in such a way\n\n1:20:57.840 --> 1:20:59.720\n that on a large scale,\n\n1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:02.320\n it will seem to be like continuous space\n\n1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:03.800\n in let's say three dimensions\n\n1:21:03.800 --> 1:21:05.240\n or some other number of dimensions\n\n1:21:05.240 --> 1:21:07.760\n or 2.6 dimensions or whatever else.\n\n1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:10.360\n Because they're much, much, much, much larger.\n\n1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:15.200\n So like the number of relationships here we're talking about\n\n1:21:15.200 --> 1:21:16.480\n is just a humongous amount.\n\n1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:18.880\n So the kind of thing you're talking about\n\n1:21:18.880 --> 1:21:20.640\n is very, very, very small relative\n\n1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:22.720\n to our experience of daily life.\n\n1:21:22.720 --> 1:21:23.760\n Right, so I mean, you know,\n\n1:21:23.760 --> 1:21:25.080\n we don't know exactly the size,\n\n1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:30.080\n but maybe 10 to the minus,\n\n1:21:30.400 --> 1:21:32.760\n maybe around 10 to the minus 100 meters.\n\n1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:34.960\n So, you know, the size of, to give a comparison,\n\n1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:38.480\n the size of a proton is 10 to the minus 15 meters.\n\n1:21:38.480 --> 1:21:42.440\n And so this is something incredibly tiny compared to that.\n\n1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:45.960\n And the idea that from that would emerge\n\n1:21:45.960 --> 1:21:50.960\n the experience of continuous space is mind blowing.\n\n1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:53.520\n Well, what's your intuition why that's possible?\n\n1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:57.480\n Like, first of all, I mean, we'll get into it,\n\n1:21:57.480 --> 1:21:59.320\n but I don't know if we will\n\n1:21:59.320 --> 1:22:01.840\n through the medium of conversation,\n\n1:22:01.840 --> 1:22:06.400\n but the construct of hypergraphs is just beautiful.\n\n1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:07.240\n Right.\n\n1:22:07.240 --> 1:22:08.200\n Cellular automata are beautiful.\n\n1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:09.040\n We'll talk about it.\n\n1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:11.120\n But this thing about, you know,\n\n1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:14.160\n continuity arising from discrete systems\n\n1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:17.240\n is in today's world is actually not so surprising.\n\n1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:19.480\n I mean, you know, your average computer screen, right?\n\n1:22:19.480 --> 1:22:21.920\n Every computer screen is made of discrete pixels.\n\n1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:23.680\n Yet we have the, you know,\n\n1:22:23.680 --> 1:22:25.440\n we have the idea that we're seeing\n\n1:22:25.440 --> 1:22:27.000\n these continuous pictures.\n\n1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:27.840\n I mean, it's, you know,\n\n1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:29.480\n the fact that on a large scale,\n\n1:22:29.480 --> 1:22:33.120\n continuity can arise from lots of discrete elements.\n\n1:22:33.120 --> 1:22:35.640\n This is at some level unsurprising now.\n\n1:22:35.640 --> 1:22:37.000\n Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:42.000\n But the pixels have a very definitive structure\n\n1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:46.000\n of neighbors on a computer screen.\n\n1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:46.840\n Right.\n\n1:22:46.840 --> 1:22:50.520\n There's no concept of spatial,\n\n1:22:50.520 --> 1:22:55.520\n of space inherent in the underlying fabric of reality.\n\n1:22:55.760 --> 1:22:56.600\n Right, right, right.\n\n1:22:56.600 --> 1:22:59.920\n So the point is that, but there are cases where there are.\n\n1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:03.400\n So for example, let's just imagine you have a square grid.\n\n1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:05.360\n Okay, and at every point on the grid,\n\n1:23:05.360 --> 1:23:07.680\n you have one of these atoms of space\n\n1:23:07.680 --> 1:23:09.480\n and it's connected to four other,\n\n1:23:09.480 --> 1:23:11.440\n four other atoms of space on the, you know,\n\n1:23:11.440 --> 1:23:13.640\n Northeast, Southwest corners, right?\n\n1:23:14.480 --> 1:23:17.600\n There you have something where if you zoom out from that,\n\n1:23:17.600 --> 1:23:19.040\n it's like a computer screen.\n\n1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:23.240\n Yeah, so the relationship creates the spatial,\n\n1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:26.720\n like the relationship creates a constraint,\n\n1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:31.720\n which then in an emergent sense creates a like,\n\n1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:37.720\n yeah, like basically a spatial coordinate for that thing.\n\n1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:38.560\n Yeah, right.\n\n1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:40.560\n Even though the individual point doesn't have a space.\n\n1:23:40.560 --> 1:23:42.320\n Even though the individual point doesn't know anything,\n\n1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:45.000\n it just knows what its neighbors are.\n\n1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:48.840\n On a large scale, it can be described by saying,\n\n1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:50.960\n oh, it looks like it's a, you know,\n\n1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:52.800\n this grid is zoomed out grid.\n\n1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:54.920\n You can say, well, you can describe these different points\n\n1:23:54.920 --> 1:23:56.480\n by saying they have certain positions,\n\n1:23:56.480 --> 1:23:57.840\n coordinates, et cetera.\n\n1:23:57.840 --> 1:23:59.920\n Now, in the sort of real setup,\n\n1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:00.920\n it's more complicated than that.\n\n1:24:00.920 --> 1:24:03.040\n It isn't just a square grid or something.\n\n1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:05.720\n It's something much more dynamic and complicated,\n\n1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:07.200\n which we'll talk about.\n\n1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:10.800\n But so, you know, the first idea,\n\n1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:12.720\n the first key idea is, you know,\n\n1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:13.840\n what's the universe made of?\n\n1:24:13.840 --> 1:24:15.720\n It's made of atoms of space basically\n\n1:24:15.720 --> 1:24:17.760\n with these connections between them.\n\n1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:19.320\n What kind of connections do they have?\n\n1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:23.000\n Well, so the simplest kind of thing you might say is,\n\n1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:25.200\n we've got something like a graph\n\n1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:28.440\n where every atom of space,\n\n1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:31.200\n where we have these edges that go between,\n\n1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:33.120\n these connections that go between atoms of space.\n\n1:24:33.120 --> 1:24:34.960\n We're not saying how long these edges are.\n\n1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:36.360\n We're just saying there is a connection\n\n1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:39.080\n from this place, from this atom to this atom.\n\n1:24:39.080 --> 1:24:40.600\n Just a quick pause,\n\n1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:44.520\n because there's a lot of very people that listen to this.\n\n1:24:44.520 --> 1:24:46.920\n Just to clarify, because I did a poll actually,\n\n1:24:46.920 --> 1:24:49.640\n what do you think a graph is a long time ago?\n\n1:24:49.640 --> 1:24:52.080\n And it's kind of funny how few people\n\n1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:55.920\n know the term graph outside of computer science.\n\n1:24:55.920 --> 1:24:56.760\n It's good.\n\n1:24:56.760 --> 1:24:57.600\n Let's call it a network.\n\n1:24:57.600 --> 1:24:58.440\n I think that's it.\n\n1:24:58.440 --> 1:24:59.280\n Let's call it a network is better.\n\n1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:00.920\n So, but every time, I like the word graph though.\n\n1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:03.880\n So let's define, let's just say that a graph\n\n1:25:03.880 --> 1:25:06.680\n will use terms nodes and edges maybe.\n\n1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:11.600\n And it's just the nodes represent some abstract entity\n\n1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:13.960\n and then the edges represent relationships\n\n1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:14.840\n between those entities.\n\n1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:15.880\n Right, exactly.\n\n1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:16.800\n So that's what a graph says.\n\n1:25:16.800 --> 1:25:18.480\n Sorry, so there you go.\n\n1:25:18.480 --> 1:25:20.600\n So that's the basic structure.\n\n1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:23.360\n That is the simplest case of a basic structure.\n\n1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:27.840\n Actually, it tends to be better to think about hypergraphs.\n\n1:25:27.840 --> 1:25:31.560\n So a hypergraph is just, instead of saying\n\n1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:34.600\n there are connections between pairs of things,\n\n1:25:34.600 --> 1:25:37.160\n we say there are connections between any number of things.\n\n1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:39.200\n So there might be ternary edges.\n\n1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:42.920\n So instead of just having two points\n\n1:25:42.920 --> 1:25:44.520\n are connected by an edge,\n\n1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:48.320\n you say three points are all associated with a hyperedge,\n\n1:25:48.320 --> 1:25:50.200\n are all connected by a hyperedge.\n\n1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:54.120\n That's just, at some level, that's a detail.\n\n1:25:54.120 --> 1:25:57.880\n It's a detail that happens to make the, for me,\n\n1:25:57.880 --> 1:26:00.000\n sort of in the history of this project,\n\n1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.320\n the realization that you could do things that way\n\n1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:04.360\n broke out of certain kinds of arbitrariness\n\n1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:06.080\n that I felt that there was in the model\n\n1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:07.880\n before I had seen how this worked.\n\n1:26:07.880 --> 1:26:12.440\n I mean, a hypergraph can be mapped to a graph.\n\n1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:14.360\n It's just a convenient representation.\n\n1:26:14.360 --> 1:26:15.320\n Mathematical speaking.\n\n1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:16.920\n That's correct. That's correct.\n\n1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:19.680\n But so then, so, okay, so the first question,\n\n1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:22.720\n the first idea of these models of ours is\n\n1:26:22.720 --> 1:26:26.520\n space is made of these connected sort of atoms of space.\n\n1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:29.800\n The next idea is space is all there is.\n\n1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:31.840\n There's nothing except for this space.\n\n1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:33.880\n So in traditional ideas in physics,\n\n1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:36.960\n people have said there's space, it's kind of a background.\n\n1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:39.200\n And then there's matter, all these particles, electrons,\n\n1:26:39.200 --> 1:26:43.360\n all these other things, which exist in space, right?\n\n1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:46.200\n But in this model, one of the key ideas is\n\n1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:48.400\n there's nothing except space.\n\n1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:52.160\n So in other words, everything that exists in the universe\n\n1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:54.640\n is a feature of this hypergraph.\n\n1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:55.920\n So how can that possibly be?\n\n1:26:55.920 --> 1:26:58.040\n Well, the way that works is\n\n1:26:58.040 --> 1:27:01.640\n that there are certain structures in this hypergraph\n\n1:27:01.640 --> 1:27:05.760\n where you say that little twisty knotted thing,\n\n1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:07.240\n we don't know exactly how this works yet,\n\n1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:10.960\n but we have sort of idea about how it works mathematically.\n\n1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:13.000\n This sort of twisted knotted thing,\n\n1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:14.840\n that's the core of an electron.\n\n1:27:14.840 --> 1:27:17.360\n This thing over there that has this different form,\n\n1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:18.520\n that's something else.\n\n1:27:18.520 --> 1:27:21.040\n So the different peculiarities of the structure\n\n1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:24.800\n of this graph are the very things\n\n1:27:24.800 --> 1:27:29.000\n that we think of as the particles inside the space,\n\n1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:31.760\n but in fact, it's just a property of the space.\n\n1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:34.960\n Mind blowing, first of all, that it's mind blowing,\n\n1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:38.520\n and we'll probably talk in its simplicity and beauty.\n\n1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:40.480\n Yes, I think it's very beautiful.\n\n1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:41.320\n I mean, this is, I'm...\n\n1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:43.080\n But okay, but that's space,\n\n1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:44.560\n and then there's another concept\n\n1:27:44.560 --> 1:27:45.880\n we didn't really kind of mention,\n\n1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:50.480\n but you think it of computation as a transformation.\n\n1:27:50.480 --> 1:27:51.680\n Let's talk about time in a second.\n\n1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:55.360\n Let's just, I mean, on the subject of space,\n\n1:27:55.360 --> 1:27:57.680\n there's this question of kind of what,\n\n1:27:57.680 --> 1:27:59.880\n there's this idea, there is this hypergraph,\n\n1:27:59.880 --> 1:28:01.760\n it represents space,\n\n1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:03.640\n and it represents everything that's in space.\n\n1:28:03.640 --> 1:28:05.320\n The features of that hypergraph,\n\n1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:08.320\n you can say certain features in this part we do know,\n\n1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:09.680\n certain features of the hypergraph\n\n1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:11.800\n represent the presence of energy, for example,\n\n1:28:11.800 --> 1:28:13.960\n or the presence of mass or momentum,\n\n1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:16.080\n and we know what the features of the hypergraph\n\n1:28:16.080 --> 1:28:17.920\n that represent those things are,\n\n1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:20.320\n but it's all just the same hypergraph.\n\n1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:22.040\n So one thing you might ask is,\n\n1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:24.280\n you know, if you just look at this hypergraph and you say,\n\n1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:27.160\n and we're gonna talk about sort of what the hypergraph does,\n\n1:28:27.160 --> 1:28:28.600\n but if you say, you know,\n\n1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:31.320\n how much of what's going on in this hypergraph\n\n1:28:31.320 --> 1:28:34.040\n is things we know and care about,\n\n1:28:34.040 --> 1:28:36.520\n like particles and atoms and electrons\n\n1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:37.560\n and all this kind of thing,\n\n1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:40.880\n and how much is just the background of space?\n\n1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:45.440\n So it turns out, so far as in one rough estimate of this,\n\n1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:47.880\n everything that we care about in the universe\n\n1:28:47.880 --> 1:28:50.800\n is only one part in 10 to the 120\n\n1:28:50.800 --> 1:28:52.040\n of what's actually going on.\n\n1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:54.040\n The vast majority of what's happening\n\n1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:57.360\n is purely things that maintain the structure of space.\n\n1:28:57.360 --> 1:28:59.760\n That, in other words, that the things that are\n\n1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:03.280\n the features of space that are the things\n\n1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:04.640\n that we consider notable,\n\n1:29:04.640 --> 1:29:06.480\n like the presence of particles and so on,\n\n1:29:06.480 --> 1:29:08.760\n that's a tiny little piece of froth\n\n1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:10.680\n on the top of all this activity\n\n1:29:10.680 --> 1:29:13.560\n that mostly is just intended to,\n\n1:29:13.560 --> 1:29:15.160\n you know, mostly, I can't say intended,\n\n1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:16.480\n there's no intention here,\n\n1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:19.000\n that just maintains the structure of space.\n\n1:29:20.600 --> 1:29:21.960\n Let me load that in.\n\n1:29:24.160 --> 1:29:26.720\n It just makes me feel so good as a human being.\n\n1:29:27.880 --> 1:29:31.800\n To be the froth on the one in a 10 to the 120\n\n1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:33.120\n or something of, well.\n\n1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:37.960\n And also just humbling how,\n\n1:29:37.960 --> 1:29:39.880\n in this mathematical framework,\n\n1:29:39.880 --> 1:29:41.400\n how much work needs to be done\n\n1:29:41.400 --> 1:29:44.840\n on the infrastructure of our universe.\n\n1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:46.840\n Right, to maintain the infrastructure of our universe\n\n1:29:46.840 --> 1:29:47.960\n is a lot of work.\n\n1:29:47.960 --> 1:29:51.560\n We are merely writing a little tiny things\n\n1:29:51.560 --> 1:29:53.360\n on top of that infrastructure.\n\n1:29:53.360 --> 1:29:57.480\n But you were just starting to talk a little bit about,\n\n1:29:57.480 --> 1:29:59.800\n we talked about space,\n\n1:29:59.800 --> 1:30:03.280\n that represents all the stuff that's in the universe.\n\n1:30:03.280 --> 1:30:06.080\n The question is, what does that stuff do?\n\n1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:09.200\n And for that, we have to start talking about time\n\n1:30:09.200 --> 1:30:11.440\n and what is time and so on.\n\n1:30:11.440 --> 1:30:15.240\n And, you know, one of the basic idea of this model\n\n1:30:15.240 --> 1:30:18.000\n is time is the progression of computation.\n\n1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:21.040\n So in other words, we have a structure of space\n\n1:30:21.040 --> 1:30:23.000\n and there is a rule that says\n\n1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:25.120\n how that structure of space will change.\n\n1:30:25.120 --> 1:30:26.160\n And it's the application,\n\n1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:28.480\n the repeated application of that rule\n\n1:30:28.480 --> 1:30:31.320\n that defines the progress of time.\n\n1:30:32.400 --> 1:30:34.040\n And what does the rule look like\n\n1:30:34.040 --> 1:30:36.000\n in the space of hypergraphs?\n\n1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:38.640\n Right, so what the rule says is something like,\n\n1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:40.440\n if you have a little tiny piece of hypergraph\n\n1:30:40.440 --> 1:30:42.200\n that looks like this,\n\n1:30:42.200 --> 1:30:44.720\n then it will be transformed into a piece of hypergraph\n\n1:30:44.720 --> 1:30:46.640\n that looks like this.\n\n1:30:46.640 --> 1:30:47.880\n So that's all it says.\n\n1:30:47.880 --> 1:30:51.280\n It says you pick up these elements of space\n\n1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:54.360\n and you can think of these edges,\n\n1:30:54.360 --> 1:30:56.040\n these hyper edges as being relations\n\n1:30:56.040 --> 1:30:57.720\n between elements in space.\n\n1:30:57.720 --> 1:31:01.200\n You might pick up these two relations\n\n1:31:01.200 --> 1:31:03.280\n between elements in space.\n\n1:31:03.280 --> 1:31:04.840\n And we're not saying where those elements are\n\n1:31:04.840 --> 1:31:05.680\n or what they are,\n\n1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:07.520\n but every time there's a certain arrangement\n\n1:31:07.520 --> 1:31:09.240\n of elements in space,\n\n1:31:09.240 --> 1:31:12.200\n then arrangement in the sense of the way they're connected,\n\n1:31:12.200 --> 1:31:14.640\n then we transform it into some other arrangement.\n\n1:31:14.640 --> 1:31:16.280\n So there's a little tiny pattern\n\n1:31:16.280 --> 1:31:18.520\n and you transform it into another little pattern.\n\n1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:19.360\n That's right.\n\n1:31:19.360 --> 1:31:20.840\n And then because of this,\n\n1:31:20.840 --> 1:31:23.280\n I mean, again, it's kind of similar to cellular automata\n\n1:31:23.280 --> 1:31:26.840\n in that like on paper, the rule looks like super simple.\n\n1:31:26.840 --> 1:31:29.160\n It's like, yeah, okay.\n\n1:31:30.480 --> 1:31:33.680\n Yeah, right, from this, the universe can be born.\n\n1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:36.720\n But like once you start applying it,\n\n1:31:36.720 --> 1:31:39.040\n beautiful structure starts being,\n\n1:31:39.040 --> 1:31:41.000\n potentially can be created.\n\n1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:43.560\n And what you're doing is you're applying that rule\n\n1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:45.400\n to different parts,\n\n1:31:45.400 --> 1:31:49.320\n like anytime you match it within the hypergraph.\n\n1:31:49.320 --> 1:31:53.160\n And then one of the like incredibly beautiful\n\n1:31:53.160 --> 1:31:55.640\n and interesting things to think about\n\n1:31:55.640 --> 1:31:59.280\n is the order in which you apply that rule,\n\n1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:02.000\n because that pattern appears all over the place.\n\n1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:04.400\n Right, so this is a big complicated thing,\n\n1:32:04.400 --> 1:32:06.200\n very hard to wrap one's brain around, okay?\n\n1:32:06.200 --> 1:32:10.680\n So you say the rule is every time you see this little pattern\n\n1:32:10.680 --> 1:32:12.520\n transform it in this way.\n\n1:32:12.520 --> 1:32:15.800\n But yet, as you look around the space\n\n1:32:15.800 --> 1:32:17.400\n that represents the universe,\n\n1:32:17.400 --> 1:32:18.760\n there may be zillions of places\n\n1:32:18.760 --> 1:32:20.600\n where that little pattern occurs.\n\n1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:24.440\n So what it says is just do this,\n\n1:32:24.440 --> 1:32:26.920\n apply this rule wherever you feel like.\n\n1:32:26.920 --> 1:32:31.360\n And what is extremely non trivial is,\n\n1:32:31.360 --> 1:32:33.520\n well, okay, so this is happening sort of\n\n1:32:33.520 --> 1:32:35.920\n in computer science terms, sort of asynchronously,\n\n1:32:35.920 --> 1:32:39.000\n you're just doing it wherever you feel like doing it.\n\n1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:41.120\n And the only constraint is\n\n1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:43.880\n that if you're going to apply the rule somewhere,\n\n1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:46.760\n the things to which you apply the rule,\n\n1:32:46.760 --> 1:32:50.080\n the little elements to which you apply the rule,\n\n1:32:50.080 --> 1:32:54.200\n if they have to be,\n\n1:32:54.200 --> 1:32:56.560\n okay, well, you can think of each application of the rule\n\n1:32:56.560 --> 1:32:59.840\n as being kind of an event that happens in the universe.\n\n1:32:59.840 --> 1:33:04.760\n And the input to an event has to be ready\n\n1:33:04.760 --> 1:33:06.240\n for the event to occur.\n\n1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:08.240\n That is, if one event occurred,\n\n1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:10.000\n if one transformation occurred,\n\n1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:12.720\n and it produced a particular atom of space,\n\n1:33:12.720 --> 1:33:17.200\n then that atom of space has to already exist\n\n1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:20.880\n before another transformation that's going to apply\n\n1:33:20.880 --> 1:33:23.240\n to that atom of space can occur.\n\n1:33:23.240 --> 1:33:25.840\n So that's like the prerequisite for the event.\n\n1:33:25.840 --> 1:33:26.920\n That's right, that's right.\n\n1:33:26.920 --> 1:33:30.520\n So that defines a kind of,\n\n1:33:30.520 --> 1:33:33.840\n this sort of set of causal relationships between events.\n\n1:33:33.840 --> 1:33:38.000\n It says, this event has to have happened before this event.\n\n1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.200\n But that is...\n\n1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:42.960\n But that's not a very limiting constraint.\n\n1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:44.080\n No, it's not.\n\n1:33:44.080 --> 1:33:44.960\n And what's interesting...\n\n1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:47.200\n You still get the zillion,\n\n1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:49.760\n that's a technical term, options.\n\n1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:50.680\n That's correct.\n\n1:33:50.680 --> 1:33:53.760\n But, okay, so this is where things get a little bit more\n\n1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:54.600\n elaborate, but...\n\n1:33:54.600 --> 1:33:56.640\n But they're mind blowing, so...\n\n1:33:56.640 --> 1:33:59.120\n Right, but so what happens is,\n\n1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:01.160\n so the first thing you might say is,\n\n1:34:01.160 --> 1:34:02.520\n you know, let's...\n\n1:34:02.520 --> 1:34:04.800\n Well, okay, so this question about the freedom\n\n1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:07.200\n of which event you do when.\n\n1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:10.200\n Well, let me sort of state an answer and then explain it.\n\n1:34:10.200 --> 1:34:14.120\n Okay, the validity of special relativity\n\n1:34:14.120 --> 1:34:17.000\n is a consequence of the fact that in some sense,\n\n1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:19.240\n it doesn't matter in what order you do\n\n1:34:19.240 --> 1:34:22.160\n these underlying things, so long as they respect\n\n1:34:22.160 --> 1:34:24.440\n this kind of set of causal relationships.\n\n1:34:25.400 --> 1:34:26.240\n So...\n\n1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:30.640\n And that's the part that's in a certain sense\n\n1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:31.800\n is a really important one,\n\n1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:35.640\n but the fact that it sometimes doesn't matter,\n\n1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:37.080\n that's a...\n\n1:34:37.080 --> 1:34:37.920\n I don't know what to...\n\n1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:38.760\n That's another, like, beautiful thing.\n\n1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:40.520\n Well, okay, so there's this idea\n\n1:34:40.520 --> 1:34:42.560\n of what I call causal invariance.\n\n1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:44.080\n Causal invariance, exactly.\n\n1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:44.920\n So that's a...\n\n1:34:44.920 --> 1:34:46.240\n Really, really powerful idea.\n\n1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:47.640\n Right, it's a powerful idea,\n\n1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:50.080\n which has actually arisen in different forms\n\n1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:52.040\n many times in the history of mathematics,\n\n1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:54.880\n mathematical logic, even computer science,\n\n1:34:54.880 --> 1:34:56.800\n has many different names.\n\n1:34:56.800 --> 1:34:58.200\n I mean, our particular version of it\n\n1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:00.240\n is a little bit tighter than other versions,\n\n1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:01.480\n but it's basically the same idea.\n\n1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:03.680\n Here's how to think about that idea.\n\n1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:05.440\n So imagine that...\n\n1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:08.120\n Well, let's talk about it in terms of math for a second.\n\n1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:10.600\n Let's say you're doing algebra and you're told,\n\n1:35:10.600 --> 1:35:14.280\n you know, multiply out this series of polynomials\n\n1:35:14.280 --> 1:35:16.800\n that are multiplied together, okay?\n\n1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:19.120\n You say, well, which order should I do that in?\n\n1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:21.480\n Say, well, do I multiply the third one by the fourth one\n\n1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:22.640\n and then do it by the first one?\n\n1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:25.920\n Or do I do the fifth one by the sixth one and then do that?\n\n1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:27.800\n Well, it turns out it doesn't matter.\n\n1:35:27.800 --> 1:35:29.720\n You can multiply them out in any order,\n\n1:35:29.720 --> 1:35:31.560\n you'll always get the same answer.\n\n1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:33.760\n That's a property...\n\n1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:36.240\n If you think about kind of making a kind of network\n\n1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:38.720\n that represents in what order you do things,\n\n1:35:38.720 --> 1:35:40.680\n you'll get different orders\n\n1:35:40.680 --> 1:35:42.760\n for different ways of multiplying things out,\n\n1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:44.880\n but you'll always get the same answer.\n\n1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:45.720\n Same thing if you...\n\n1:35:45.720 --> 1:35:46.680\n Let's say you're sorting.\n\n1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:48.880\n You've got a bunch of A's and B's.\n\n1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:50.280\n They're in random, some random order,\n\n1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:53.400\n you know, BAA, BBBAA, whatever.\n\n1:35:53.400 --> 1:35:55.240\n And you have a little rule that says,\n\n1:35:55.240 --> 1:36:00.000\n every time you see BA, flip it around to AB, okay?\n\n1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.280\n Eventually you apply that rule enough times,\n\n1:36:02.280 --> 1:36:03.800\n you'll have sorted the string\n\n1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:06.480\n so that it's all the A's first and then all the B's.\n\n1:36:07.400 --> 1:36:10.040\n Again, there are many different orders\n\n1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:13.200\n in which you can do that to many different sort of places\n\n1:36:13.200 --> 1:36:15.280\n where you can apply that update.\n\n1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:18.520\n In the end, you'll always get the string sorted the same way.\n\n1:36:18.520 --> 1:36:22.320\n I know with sorting the string, it sounds obvious.\n\n1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:23.600\n That's to me surprising\n\n1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:28.320\n that there is in complicated systems,\n\n1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:29.840\n obviously with a string,\n\n1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:33.760\n but in a hypergraph that the application of the rule,\n\n1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:36.720\n asynchronous rule can lead to the same results sometimes.\n\n1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:39.080\n Yes, yes, that is not obvious.\n\n1:36:39.080 --> 1:36:40.720\n And it was something that, you know,\n\n1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:44.080\n I sort of discovered that idea for these kinds of systems\n\n1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:45.520\n and back in the 1990s.\n\n1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:50.360\n And for various reasons, I was not satisfied\n\n1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:54.320\n by how sort of fragile finding that particular property was.\n\n1:36:54.320 --> 1:36:56.360\n And let me just make another point,\n\n1:36:56.360 --> 1:37:01.120\n which is that it turns out that even if the underlying rule\n\n1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:03.880\n does not have this property of causal invariance,\n\n1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:06.200\n it can turn out that every observation\n\n1:37:06.200 --> 1:37:09.240\n made by observers of the rule can,\n\n1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:12.680\n they can impose what amounts to causal invariance\n\n1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:13.880\n on the rule.\n\n1:37:13.880 --> 1:37:14.720\n We can explain that.\n\n1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:15.560\n It's a little bit more complicated.\n\n1:37:15.560 --> 1:37:18.000\n I mean, technically that has to do with this idea\n\n1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.160\n of completions, which is something that comes up\n\n1:37:20.160 --> 1:37:21.760\n in term rewriting systems,\n\n1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:24.040\n automated theorem proving systems and so on.\n\n1:37:24.040 --> 1:37:26.320\n But let's ignore that for a second.\n\n1:37:26.320 --> 1:37:27.560\n We can come to that later.\n\n1:37:27.560 --> 1:37:29.840\n But is it useful to talk about observation?\n\n1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:30.680\n Not yet.\n\n1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:31.720\n Not yet.\n\n1:37:31.720 --> 1:37:33.160\n It's so great.\n\n1:37:33.160 --> 1:37:35.560\n So there's some concept of causal invariance\n\n1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:39.480\n as you apply these rules in an asynchronous way,\n\n1:37:39.480 --> 1:37:42.200\n you can think of those transformations as events.\n\n1:37:42.200 --> 1:37:44.400\n So there's this hypergraph that represents space\n\n1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:47.000\n and all of these events happening in the space\n\n1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:50.440\n and the graph grows in interesting complicated ways.\n\n1:37:50.440 --> 1:37:54.560\n And eventually the froth arises of what we experience\n\n1:37:54.560 --> 1:37:56.200\n as human existence.\n\n1:37:56.200 --> 1:37:57.440\n So that's it.\n\n1:37:57.440 --> 1:37:58.920\n That's some version of the picture,\n\n1:37:58.920 --> 1:38:00.800\n but let's explain a little bit more.\n\n1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:01.640\n Exactly.\n\n1:38:01.640 --> 1:38:03.600\n What's a little more detail like?\n\n1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:04.440\n Right.\n\n1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:06.760\n Well, so one thing that is sort of surprising\n\n1:38:06.760 --> 1:38:10.080\n in this theory is one of the sort of achievements\n\n1:38:10.080 --> 1:38:12.000\n of 20th century physics was kind of bringing\n\n1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:13.880\n space and time together.\n\n1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:15.720\n That was, you know, special relativity.\n\n1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:19.320\n People talk about space time, this sort of unified thing\n\n1:38:19.320 --> 1:38:21.880\n where space and time kind of a mixed\n\n1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:24.680\n and there's a nice mathematical formalism\n\n1:38:24.680 --> 1:38:28.040\n that in which, you know, space and time sort of appear\n\n1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:30.760\n as part of the space time continuum,\n\n1:38:30.760 --> 1:38:34.480\n the space time, you know, four vectors and things like this.\n\n1:38:34.480 --> 1:38:37.320\n You know, we talk about time as the fourth dimension\n\n1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:38.800\n and all these kinds of things.\n\n1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:42.200\n It's, you know, and it seems like the theory of relativity\n\n1:38:42.200 --> 1:38:44.040\n sort of says space and time are fundamentally\n\n1:38:44.040 --> 1:38:45.400\n the same kind of thing.\n\n1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:48.680\n So one of the things that took a while to understand\n\n1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:53.680\n in this approach of mine is that in my kind of approach,\n\n1:38:54.880 --> 1:38:56.680\n space and time are really not fundamentally\n\n1:38:56.680 --> 1:38:57.520\n the same kind of thing.\n\n1:38:57.520 --> 1:39:00.480\n Space is the extension of this hypergraph.\n\n1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:04.440\n Time is the kind of progress of this inexorable computation\n\n1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:07.040\n of these rules getting applied to the hypergraph.\n\n1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:10.000\n So it's, they seem like very different kinds of things.\n\n1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.760\n And so that at first seems like\n\n1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:14.160\n how can that possibly be right?\n\n1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:16.440\n How can that possibly be Lorentz invariant?\n\n1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:18.840\n That's the term for things being, you know,\n\n1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:21.600\n following the rules of special relativity.\n\n1:39:21.600 --> 1:39:26.120\n Well, it turns out that when you have causal invariants\n\n1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:30.120\n that, and let's see, we can, it's worth explaining\n\n1:39:30.120 --> 1:39:31.000\n a little bit how this works.\n\n1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.440\n It's a little bit elaborate,\n\n1:39:32.440 --> 1:39:37.440\n but the basic point is that even though space and time\n\n1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:41.640\n sort of come from very different places,\n\n1:39:41.640 --> 1:39:45.360\n it turns out that the rules of sort of space time\n\n1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:50.360\n that special relativity talks about come out of this model\n\n1:39:51.080 --> 1:39:53.680\n when you're looking at large enough systems.\n\n1:39:53.680 --> 1:39:56.080\n So a way to think about this, you know,\n\n1:39:56.080 --> 1:39:59.480\n in terms of when you're looking at large enough systems,\n\n1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:03.800\n the part of that story is when you look at some fluid\n\n1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:06.280\n like water, for example, there are equations\n\n1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:07.860\n that govern the flow of water.\n\n1:40:08.920 --> 1:40:12.720\n Those equations are things that apply on a large scale.\n\n1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:14.400\n If you look at the individual molecules,\n\n1:40:14.400 --> 1:40:16.280\n they don't know anything about those equations.\n\n1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:19.360\n It's just the sort of the large scale effect\n\n1:40:19.360 --> 1:40:22.800\n of those molecules turns out to follow those equations.\n\n1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:25.960\n And it's the same kind of thing happening in our models.\n\n1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:27.960\n I know this might be a small point,\n\n1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:29.600\n but it might be a very big one.\n\n1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:32.560\n We've been talking about space and time\n\n1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:35.960\n at the lowest level of the model, which is space.\n\n1:40:35.960 --> 1:40:39.860\n The hypergraph time is the evolution of this hypergraph.\n\n1:40:39.860 --> 1:40:43.160\n But there's also space time that we think about\n\n1:40:43.160 --> 1:40:46.400\n and general relativity for your special relativity.\n\n1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:52.400\n Like how do you go from the lowest source code\n\n1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:55.960\n of space and time as we're talking about\n\n1:40:55.960 --> 1:40:58.720\n to the more traditional terminology of space and time?\n\n1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:01.840\n So the key thing is this thing we call the causal graph.\n\n1:41:01.840 --> 1:41:03.760\n So the causal graph is the graph\n\n1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:06.660\n of causal relationships between events.\n\n1:41:06.660 --> 1:41:08.980\n So every one of these little updating events,\n\n1:41:08.980 --> 1:41:10.320\n every one of these little transformations\n\n1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:13.360\n of the hypergraph happens somewhere in the hypergraph,\n\n1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:16.800\n happens at some stage in the computation.\n\n1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:18.240\n That's an event.\n\n1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:22.280\n That event has a causal relationship to other events\n\n1:41:22.280 --> 1:41:27.280\n in the sense that if another event needs as its input,\n\n1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:29.440\n the output from the first event,\n\n1:41:29.440 --> 1:41:31.140\n there will be a causal relationship\n\n1:41:31.140 --> 1:41:35.220\n of the future event will depend on the past event.\n\n1:41:35.220 --> 1:41:37.960\n So you can say it has a causal connection.\n\n1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:39.760\n And so you can make this graph\n\n1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:42.440\n of causal relationships between events.\n\n1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:44.240\n That graph of causal relationships,\n\n1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:47.680\n causal invariance implies that that graph is unique.\n\n1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:51.280\n It doesn't matter even though you think,\n\n1:41:51.280 --> 1:41:54.160\n oh, I'm, let's say we were sorting a string, for example,\n\n1:41:54.160 --> 1:41:57.720\n I did that particular transposition of characters\n\n1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:00.180\n at this time, then I did that one, then I did this one.\n\n1:42:00.180 --> 1:42:03.000\n Turns out if you look at the network of connections\n\n1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:06.680\n between those updating events, that network is the same.\n\n1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:11.040\n It's the, if you were to, the structure.\n\n1:42:11.040 --> 1:42:13.360\n So in other words, if you were to draw that,\n\n1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:15.440\n if you were to put that network on a picture\n\n1:42:15.440 --> 1:42:17.100\n of where you're doing all the updating,\n\n1:42:17.100 --> 1:42:20.080\n the places where you put the nodes of the network\n\n1:42:20.080 --> 1:42:22.440\n will be different, but the way the nodes are connected\n\n1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:23.560\n will always be the same.\n\n1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:27.320\n So, but the causal graph is, I don't know,\n\n1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:31.080\n it's kind of an observation, it's not enforced,\n\n1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:33.760\n it's just emergent from a set of events.\n\n1:42:33.760 --> 1:42:36.440\n It's a feature of, okay, so what it is is.\n\n1:42:36.440 --> 1:42:38.860\n The characteristic, I guess, of the way events happen.\n\n1:42:38.860 --> 1:42:40.800\n Right, it's an event can't happen\n\n1:42:40.800 --> 1:42:42.520\n until its input is ready.\n\n1:42:42.520 --> 1:42:46.360\n And so that creates this network of causal relationships.\n\n1:42:46.360 --> 1:42:48.280\n And that's the causal graph.\n\n1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:51.560\n And the thing that the next thing to realize is,\n\n1:42:51.560 --> 1:42:54.480\n okay, we, when you're going to observe\n\n1:42:54.480 --> 1:42:56.400\n what happens in the universe,\n\n1:42:56.400 --> 1:42:59.560\n you have to sort of make sense of this causal graph.\n\n1:42:59.560 --> 1:43:02.840\n So, and you are an observer who yourself\n\n1:43:02.840 --> 1:43:05.040\n is part of this causal graph.\n\n1:43:05.040 --> 1:43:07.520\n And so that means, so let me give you an example\n\n1:43:07.520 --> 1:43:08.360\n of how that works.\n\n1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:11.160\n So imagine we have a really weird theory of physics\n\n1:43:11.160 --> 1:43:15.100\n of the world where it says this updating process,\n\n1:43:15.100 --> 1:43:18.180\n there's only gonna be one update at every moment in time.\n\n1:43:18.180 --> 1:43:19.720\n And there's just gonna be like a Turing machine.\n\n1:43:19.720 --> 1:43:21.520\n It has a little head that runs around\n\n1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:23.680\n and just is always just updating one thing at a time.\n\n1:43:23.680 --> 1:43:26.040\n So you say, I have a theory of physics\n\n1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:27.480\n and the theory of physics says,\n\n1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:30.440\n there's just this one little place where things get updated.\n\n1:43:30.440 --> 1:43:32.960\n You say, that's completely crazy because,\n\n1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:35.860\n it's plainly obvious that things are being updated\n\n1:43:35.860 --> 1:43:37.120\n sort of at the same time.\n\n1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:39.280\n Async obviously, yeah, at the same time, yeah.\n\n1:43:39.280 --> 1:43:44.240\n But the fact is that the thing is that if I'm talking to you\n\n1:43:44.240 --> 1:43:47.200\n and you seem to be being updated as I'm being updated,\n\n1:43:47.200 --> 1:43:48.960\n but if there's just this one little head\n\n1:43:48.960 --> 1:43:51.000\n that's running around updating things,\n\n1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:53.440\n I will not know whether you've been updated or not\n\n1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:55.440\n until I'm updated.\n\n1:43:55.440 --> 1:43:58.640\n So in other words, draw this causal graph\n\n1:43:58.640 --> 1:44:01.000\n of the causal relationship between the updatings in you\n\n1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:02.440\n and the updatings in me,\n\n1:44:02.440 --> 1:44:04.400\n it'll still be the same causal graph,\n\n1:44:04.400 --> 1:44:07.120\n whether even though the underlying sort of story\n\n1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:10.120\n of what happens is, oh, there's just this one little thing\n\n1:44:10.120 --> 1:44:12.840\n and it goes and updates in different places in the universe.\n\n1:44:12.840 --> 1:44:17.840\n So is that clear or is that a hypothesis?\n\n1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:21.440\n Is that clear that there's a unique causal graph?\n\n1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:24.880\n If there's causal invariance, there's unique causal graph.\n\n1:44:24.880 --> 1:44:28.060\n So it's okay to think of what we're talking about\n\n1:44:28.060 --> 1:44:30.600\n as a hypergraph and the operations on it\n\n1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:32.960\n as a kind of touring machine with a single head,\n\n1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:35.760\n like a single guy running around updating stuff.\n\n1:44:37.120 --> 1:44:40.520\n Is that safe to intuitively think of it this way?\n\n1:44:40.520 --> 1:44:41.680\n Let me think about that for a second.\n\n1:44:41.680 --> 1:44:42.560\n Yes, I think so.\n\n1:44:42.560 --> 1:44:44.800\n I think there's nothing, it doesn't matter.\n\n1:44:44.800 --> 1:44:47.980\n I mean, you can say, okay, there is one,\n\n1:44:47.980 --> 1:44:52.880\n the reason I'm pausing for a second is that I'm wondering,\n\n1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:55.840\n well, when you say running around,\n\n1:44:55.840 --> 1:44:57.960\n depends how far it jumps every time it runs.\n\n1:44:57.960 --> 1:44:59.160\n Yeah, yeah, that's right.\n\n1:44:59.160 --> 1:45:02.000\n But I mean like one operation at a time.\n\n1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:03.760\n Yeah, you can think of it as one operation at a time.\n\n1:45:03.760 --> 1:45:06.680\n It's easier for the human brain to think of it that way\n\n1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:08.240\n as opposed to simultaneous.\n\n1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:10.720\n Well, maybe it's not, okay, but the thing is\n\n1:45:10.720 --> 1:45:12.720\n that's not how we experience the world.\n\n1:45:12.720 --> 1:45:15.760\n What we experience is we look around,\n\n1:45:15.760 --> 1:45:17.880\n everything seems to be happening\n\n1:45:17.880 --> 1:45:21.000\n at successive moments in time everywhere in space.\n\n1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:21.840\n Yes.\n\n1:45:21.840 --> 1:45:23.880\n That is the, and that's partly a feature\n\n1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:25.580\n of our particular construction.\n\n1:45:25.580 --> 1:45:28.480\n I mean, that is the speed of light is really fast\n\n1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:30.680\n compared to, you know, we look around, you know,\n\n1:45:30.680 --> 1:45:33.800\n I can see maybe a hundred feet away right now.\n\n1:45:33.800 --> 1:45:38.800\n You know, it's the, my brain does not process very much\n\n1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:41.280\n in the time it takes light to go a hundred feet.\n\n1:45:41.280 --> 1:45:44.040\n The brain operates at a scale of hundreds of milliseconds\n\n1:45:44.040 --> 1:45:45.320\n or something like that, I don't know.\n\n1:45:45.320 --> 1:45:46.160\n Right.\n\n1:45:46.160 --> 1:45:47.600\n And speed of light is much faster.\n\n1:45:47.600 --> 1:45:49.160\n Right, you know, light goes,\n\n1:45:49.160 --> 1:45:51.000\n in a billionth of a second light has gone afoot.\n\n1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:53.720\n So it goes a billion feet every second.\n\n1:45:53.720 --> 1:45:56.480\n There's certain moments through this conversation\n\n1:45:56.480 --> 1:46:01.200\n where I imagine the absurdity of the fact\n\n1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:05.080\n that there's two descendants of apes modeled by a hypergraph\n\n1:46:05.080 --> 1:46:06.400\n that are communicating with each other\n\n1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:09.160\n and experiencing this whole thing\n\n1:46:09.160 --> 1:46:13.440\n as a real time simultaneous update with,\n\n1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:15.440\n I'm taking in photons from you right now,\n\n1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:19.160\n but there's something much, much deeper going on here.\n\n1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:20.000\n Right, it does have a.\n\n1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.560\n It's paralyzing sometimes to just.\n\n1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:23.400\n Yes.\n\n1:46:23.400 --> 1:46:24.220\n To remember that.\n\n1:46:24.220 --> 1:46:26.400\n Right, no, I mean, you know, it's a, you know.\n\n1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:27.240\n Sorry.\n\n1:46:27.240 --> 1:46:28.080\n Yes, yes, no.\n\n1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:30.800\n As a small little tangent, I just remembered\n\n1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:32.360\n that we're talking about,\n\n1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:37.080\n I mean, about the fabric of reality.\n\n1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:40.080\n Right, so we've got this causal graph\n\n1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:41.920\n that represents the sort of causal relationships\n\n1:46:41.920 --> 1:46:43.760\n between all these events in the universe.\n\n1:46:43.760 --> 1:46:47.680\n That causal graph kind of is a representation of space time,\n\n1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:50.800\n but our experience of it requires\n\n1:46:50.800 --> 1:46:52.960\n that we pick reference frames.\n\n1:46:52.960 --> 1:46:54.200\n This is kind of a key idea.\n\n1:46:54.200 --> 1:46:57.440\n Einstein had this idea that what that means is\n\n1:46:57.440 --> 1:47:01.040\n we have to say, what are we going to pick\n\n1:47:01.040 --> 1:47:04.540\n as being the sort of what we define\n\n1:47:04.540 --> 1:47:06.840\n as simultaneous moments in time?\n\n1:47:07.680 --> 1:47:11.400\n So for example, we can say, you know,\n\n1:47:11.400 --> 1:47:13.040\n how do we set our clocks?\n\n1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:16.420\n You know, if we've got a spacecraft landing on Mars,\n\n1:47:16.420 --> 1:47:17.840\n you know, do we say that, you know,\n\n1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:19.480\n what time is it landing at?\n\n1:47:19.480 --> 1:47:21.640\n Was it, you know, even though there's a 20 minute\n\n1:47:21.640 --> 1:47:23.760\n speed of light delay or something, you know,\n\n1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:25.340\n what time do we say it landed at?\n\n1:47:25.340 --> 1:47:30.020\n How do we set up sort of time coordinates for the world?\n\n1:47:30.020 --> 1:47:32.400\n And that turns out to be that there's kind of\n\n1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:35.960\n this arbitrariness to how we set these reference frames\n\n1:47:35.960 --> 1:47:39.200\n that defines sort of what counts as simultaneous.\n\n1:47:39.200 --> 1:47:42.020\n And what is the essence of special relativity\n\n1:47:42.020 --> 1:47:45.880\n is to think about reference frames going at different speeds\n\n1:47:45.880 --> 1:47:48.760\n and to think about sort of how they assign,\n\n1:47:48.760 --> 1:47:51.460\n what counts as space, what counts as time and so on.\n\n1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:55.680\n That's all a bit technical, but the basic bottom line is\n\n1:47:55.680 --> 1:47:58.920\n that this causal invariance property,\n\n1:47:58.920 --> 1:48:01.800\n that means that it's always the same causal graph,\n\n1:48:01.800 --> 1:48:04.760\n independent of how you slice it with these reference frames,\n\n1:48:04.760 --> 1:48:07.840\n you'll always sort of see the same physical processes go on.\n\n1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:10.380\n And that's basically why special relativity works.\n\n1:48:10.380 --> 1:48:14.620\n So there's something like special relativity,\n\n1:48:14.620 --> 1:48:17.680\n like everything around space and time\n\n1:48:17.680 --> 1:48:22.680\n that fits this idea of the causal graph.\n\n1:48:22.900 --> 1:48:24.900\n Right, well, you know, one way to think about it is\n\n1:48:24.900 --> 1:48:27.280\n given that you have a basic structure\n\n1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:31.040\n that just involves updating things in these,\n\n1:48:31.040 --> 1:48:33.280\n you know, connected updates and looking at\n\n1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:35.640\n the causal relationships between connected updates,\n\n1:48:35.640 --> 1:48:39.760\n that's enough when you unravel the consequences of that,\n\n1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:41.500\n that together with the fact that there are lots\n\n1:48:41.500 --> 1:48:43.880\n of these things and that you can take a continuum limit\n\n1:48:43.880 --> 1:48:46.900\n and so on implies special relativity.\n\n1:48:46.900 --> 1:48:51.000\n And so that, it's kind of not a big deal\n\n1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:52.920\n because it's kind of a, you know,\n\n1:48:52.920 --> 1:48:56.520\n it was completely unobvious when you started off\n\n1:48:56.520 --> 1:48:57.860\n with saying, we've got this graph,\n\n1:48:57.860 --> 1:49:00.200\n it's being updated in time, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,\n\n1:49:00.200 --> 1:49:03.280\n that just looks like nothing to do with special relativity.\n\n1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:05.040\n And yet you get that.\n\n1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:08.080\n And what, I mean, then the thing,\n\n1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:11.160\n I mean, this was stuff that I figured out back in the 1990s.\n\n1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:15.140\n The next big thing you get is general relativity.\n\n1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:18.920\n And so in this hypergraph,\n\n1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:20.700\n the sort of limiting structure,\n\n1:49:20.700 --> 1:49:22.440\n when you have a very big hypergraph,\n\n1:49:22.440 --> 1:49:24.480\n you can think of as being just like, you know,\n\n1:49:24.480 --> 1:49:27.040\n water seems continuous on a large scale.\n\n1:49:27.040 --> 1:49:30.140\n So this hypergraph seems continuous on a large scale.\n\n1:49:30.140 --> 1:49:31.660\n One question is, you know,\n\n1:49:31.660 --> 1:49:35.200\n how many dimensions of space does it correspond to?\n\n1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:36.440\n So one question you can ask is,\n\n1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:38.000\n if you've just got a bunch of points\n\n1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:39.480\n and they're connected together,\n\n1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:43.160\n how do you deduce what effective dimension of space\n\n1:49:43.160 --> 1:49:46.000\n that bundle of points corresponds to?\n\n1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:47.680\n And that's pretty easy to explain.\n\n1:49:47.680 --> 1:49:50.520\n So basically if you say you've got a point\n\n1:49:50.520 --> 1:49:52.760\n and you look at how many neighbors does that point have?\n\n1:49:52.760 --> 1:49:54.680\n Okay, imagine it's on a square grid.\n\n1:49:54.680 --> 1:49:56.260\n Then it'll have four neighbors.\n\n1:49:56.260 --> 1:49:58.280\n Go another level out.\n\n1:49:58.280 --> 1:50:00.000\n How many neighbors do you get then?\n\n1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.800\n What you realize is as you go more and more levels out,\n\n1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:05.920\n as you go more and more distance on the graph out,\n\n1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:09.700\n you're capturing something which is essentially a circle\n\n1:50:09.700 --> 1:50:11.920\n in two dimensions so that, you know,\n\n1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:14.720\n the number of the area of a circle is pi R squared.\n\n1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:18.400\n So it's the number of points that you get to\n\n1:50:18.400 --> 1:50:21.540\n goes up like the distance you've gone squared.\n\n1:50:21.540 --> 1:50:24.440\n And in general, in D dimensional space,\n\n1:50:24.440 --> 1:50:25.940\n it's R to the power D.\n\n1:50:25.940 --> 1:50:28.680\n It's the number of points you get to\n\n1:50:28.680 --> 1:50:32.720\n if you go R steps on the graph grows like\n\n1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:35.560\n the number of steps you go to the power of the dimension.\n\n1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:37.760\n And that's a way that you can estimate\n\n1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:39.960\n the effective dimension of one of these graphs.\n\n1:50:39.960 --> 1:50:41.080\n So what does that grow to?\n\n1:50:41.080 --> 1:50:42.540\n So how does the dimension grow?\n\n1:50:42.540 --> 1:50:45.900\n There's a, I mean, obviously the visual aspect\n\n1:50:45.900 --> 1:50:47.380\n of these hypergraphs,\n\n1:50:47.380 --> 1:50:50.120\n they're often visualized in three dimensions.\n\n1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:50.960\n Right.\n\n1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:52.720\n So there's a certain kind of structure,\n\n1:50:54.640 --> 1:50:58.880\n like you said, there's, I mean, a circle, a sphere,\n\n1:50:58.880 --> 1:51:01.080\n there's a planar aspect to it,\n\n1:51:02.360 --> 1:51:04.680\n to this graph to where it kind of,\n\n1:51:04.680 --> 1:51:06.760\n it almost starts creating a surface,\n\n1:51:06.760 --> 1:51:09.120\n like a complicated surface, but a surface.\n\n1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:11.880\n So how does that connect to effective dimension?\n\n1:51:11.880 --> 1:51:14.400\n Okay, so if you can lay out the graph\n\n1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:18.880\n in such a way that the points in the graph that,\n\n1:51:18.880 --> 1:51:21.360\n you know, the points that are neighbors on the graph\n\n1:51:21.360 --> 1:51:23.520\n are neighbors as you lay them out,\n\n1:51:23.520 --> 1:51:25.680\n and you can do that in two dimensions,\n\n1:51:25.680 --> 1:51:28.360\n then it's gonna approximate a two dimensional thing.\n\n1:51:28.360 --> 1:51:29.760\n If you can't do that in two dimensions,\n\n1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:31.240\n if everything would have to fold over a lot\n\n1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:32.240\n in two dimensions,\n\n1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:34.080\n then it's not approximating a two dimensional thing.\n\n1:51:34.080 --> 1:51:36.200\n Maybe you can lay it out in three dimensions.\n\n1:51:36.200 --> 1:51:38.640\n Maybe you have to lay it out in five dimensions\n\n1:51:38.640 --> 1:51:39.640\n to have it be the case\n\n1:51:39.640 --> 1:51:42.000\n that it sort of smoothly lays out like that.\n\n1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:44.720\n Well, but okay, so I apologize\n\n1:51:44.720 --> 1:51:46.060\n for the different tangent questions,\n\n1:51:46.060 --> 1:51:49.440\n but you know, there's an infinity number of possible rules.\n\n1:51:51.320 --> 1:51:54.600\n So we have to look for rules\n\n1:51:54.600 --> 1:51:58.520\n that create the kind of structures\n\n1:51:58.520 --> 1:52:00.580\n that are reminiscent for,\n\n1:52:01.560 --> 1:52:05.080\n that have echoes of the different physics theories in them.\n\n1:52:05.080 --> 1:52:06.600\n So what kind of rules,\n\n1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:08.240\n is there something simple to be said\n\n1:52:08.240 --> 1:52:12.080\n about the kind of rules that you have found beautiful,\n\n1:52:12.080 --> 1:52:13.480\n that you have found powerful?\n\n1:52:13.480 --> 1:52:15.400\n Right, so I mean, what, you know,\n\n1:52:15.400 --> 1:52:18.760\n one of the features of computational irreducibility is,\n\n1:52:18.760 --> 1:52:21.980\n it's very, you can't say in advance,\n\n1:52:21.980 --> 1:52:23.960\n what's gonna happen with any particular,\n\n1:52:23.960 --> 1:52:26.000\n you can't say, I'm gonna pick these rules\n\n1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.900\n from this part of rule space, so to speak,\n\n1:52:28.900 --> 1:52:30.960\n because they're gonna be the ones that are gonna work.\n\n1:52:30.960 --> 1:52:33.360\n That's, you can make some statements along those lines,\n\n1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:35.200\n but you can't generally say that.\n\n1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:38.280\n Now, you know, the state of what we've been able to do\n\n1:52:38.280 --> 1:52:40.680\n is, you know, different properties of the universe,\n\n1:52:40.680 --> 1:52:44.600\n like dimensionality, you know, integer dimensionality,\n\n1:52:44.600 --> 1:52:47.960\n features of other features of quantum mechanics,\n\n1:52:47.960 --> 1:52:48.960\n things like that.\n\n1:52:48.960 --> 1:52:50.600\n At this point, what we've got is,\n\n1:52:50.600 --> 1:52:55.380\n we've got rules that any one of those features,\n\n1:52:55.380 --> 1:52:58.080\n we can get a rule that has that feature.\n\n1:52:58.080 --> 1:52:58.920\n Yeah, so the.\n\n1:52:58.920 --> 1:53:00.720\n We don't have the sort of, the final,\n\n1:53:00.720 --> 1:53:02.640\n here's a rule which has all of these features,\n\n1:53:02.640 --> 1:53:03.680\n we do not have that yet.\n\n1:53:03.680 --> 1:53:06.960\n So if I were to try to summarize\n\n1:53:06.960 --> 1:53:11.380\n the Wolfram physics project, which is, you know,\n\n1:53:11.380 --> 1:53:13.920\n something that's been in your brain for a long time,\n\n1:53:13.920 --> 1:53:17.280\n but really has just exploded in activity,\n\n1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:19.160\n you know, only just months ago.\n\n1:53:19.160 --> 1:53:20.040\n Yes.\n\n1:53:20.040 --> 1:53:23.480\n So it's an evolving thing, and next week,\n\n1:53:23.480 --> 1:53:24.920\n I'll try to publish this conversation\n\n1:53:24.920 --> 1:53:27.840\n as quickly as possible, because by the time it's published,\n\n1:53:27.840 --> 1:53:29.640\n already new things will probably have come out.\n\n1:53:29.640 --> 1:53:33.180\n So if I were to summarize it,\n\n1:53:33.180 --> 1:53:35.940\n we've talked about the basics of,\n\n1:53:35.940 --> 1:53:38.360\n there's a hypergraph that represents space,\n\n1:53:38.360 --> 1:53:42.360\n there is transformations in that hypergraph\n\n1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:44.720\n that represents time.\n\n1:53:44.720 --> 1:53:45.560\n The progress of time.\n\n1:53:45.560 --> 1:53:47.840\n The progress of time, there's a causal graph\n\n1:53:47.840 --> 1:53:49.640\n that's a characteristic of this,\n\n1:53:49.640 --> 1:53:53.720\n and the basic process of science,\n\n1:53:53.720 --> 1:53:58.640\n of, yeah, of science within the Wolfram physics model\n\n1:53:58.640 --> 1:54:02.560\n is to try different rules and see which properties\n\n1:54:02.560 --> 1:54:06.120\n of physics that we know of, known physical theories,\n\n1:54:06.120 --> 1:54:10.700\n are, appear within the graphs that emerge from that rule.\n\n1:54:10.700 --> 1:54:12.400\n That's what I thought it was going to be.\n\n1:54:12.400 --> 1:54:13.660\n Uh oh, okay.\n\n1:54:13.660 --> 1:54:16.080\n So what is it?\n\n1:54:16.080 --> 1:54:18.200\n It turns out we can do a lot better than that.\n\n1:54:18.200 --> 1:54:21.400\n It turns out that using kind of mathematical ideas,\n\n1:54:21.400 --> 1:54:25.140\n we can say, and computational ideas,\n\n1:54:25.140 --> 1:54:28.400\n we can make general statements,\n\n1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:31.520\n and those general statements turn out to correspond\n\n1:54:31.520 --> 1:54:34.080\n to things that we know from 20th century physics.\n\n1:54:34.080 --> 1:54:36.940\n In other words, the idea of you just try a bunch of rules\n\n1:54:36.940 --> 1:54:37.780\n and see what they do,\n\n1:54:37.780 --> 1:54:40.240\n that's what I thought we were gonna have to do.\n\n1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:43.760\n But in fact, we can say, given causal invariance\n\n1:54:43.760 --> 1:54:47.480\n and computational irreducibility, we can derive,\n\n1:54:47.480 --> 1:54:49.480\n and this is where it gets really pretty interesting,\n\n1:54:49.480 --> 1:54:51.120\n we can derive special relativity,\n\n1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:52.920\n we can derive general relativity,\n\n1:54:52.920 --> 1:54:55.140\n we can derive quantum mechanics.\n\n1:54:55.140 --> 1:54:58.280\n And that's where things really start to get exciting,\n\n1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:01.340\n is, you know, it wasn't at all obvious to me\n\n1:55:01.340 --> 1:55:03.360\n that even if we were completely correct,\n\n1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:05.240\n and even if we had, you know, this is the rule,\n\n1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:06.920\n you know, even if we found the rule,\n\n1:55:06.920 --> 1:55:08.940\n to be able to say, yes, it corresponds\n\n1:55:08.940 --> 1:55:10.360\n to things we already know,\n\n1:55:10.360 --> 1:55:12.660\n I did not expect that to be the case.\n\n1:55:12.660 --> 1:55:13.500\n And...\n\n1:55:13.500 --> 1:55:16.920\n So for somebody who is a simple mind\n\n1:55:16.920 --> 1:55:19.460\n and definitely not a physicist, not even close,\n\n1:55:19.460 --> 1:55:22.760\n what does derivation mean in this case?\n\n1:55:22.760 --> 1:55:26.940\n Okay, so let me, this is an interesting question.\n\n1:55:26.940 --> 1:55:29.160\n Okay, so there's, so one thing...\n\n1:55:29.160 --> 1:55:31.880\n In the context of computational irreducibility.\n\n1:55:31.880 --> 1:55:32.920\n Yeah, yeah, right, right.\n\n1:55:32.920 --> 1:55:36.840\n So what you have to do, let me go back to, again,\n\n1:55:36.840 --> 1:55:39.000\n the mundane example of fluids and water\n\n1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:40.400\n and things like that, right?\n\n1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:44.040\n So you have a bunch of molecules bouncing around.\n\n1:55:44.040 --> 1:55:47.340\n You can say, just as a piece of mathematics,\n\n1:55:47.340 --> 1:55:49.260\n I happen to do this from cellular automata\n\n1:55:49.260 --> 1:55:52.160\n back in the mid 1980s, you can say,\n\n1:55:52.160 --> 1:55:54.200\n just as a matter of mathematics,\n\n1:55:54.200 --> 1:55:57.240\n you can say the continuum limit\n\n1:55:57.240 --> 1:55:59.240\n of these little molecules bouncing around\n\n1:55:59.240 --> 1:56:01.640\n is the Navier Stokes equations.\n\n1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:03.260\n That's just a piece of mathematics.\n\n1:56:03.260 --> 1:56:06.640\n It's not, it doesn't rely on...\n\n1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:08.480\n You have to make certain assumptions\n\n1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:10.880\n that you have to say there's enough randomness\n\n1:56:10.880 --> 1:56:12.400\n in the way the molecules bounce around\n\n1:56:12.400 --> 1:56:14.240\n that certain statistical averages work,\n\n1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:15.680\n et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:18.320\n Okay, it is a very similar derivation\n\n1:56:18.320 --> 1:56:21.220\n to derive, for example, the Einstein equations.\n\n1:56:21.220 --> 1:56:23.720\n Okay, so the way that works, roughly,\n\n1:56:23.720 --> 1:56:26.740\n the Einstein equations are about curvature of space.\n\n1:56:26.740 --> 1:56:29.080\n Curvature of space, I talked about sort of\n\n1:56:29.080 --> 1:56:31.840\n how you can figure out dimension of space.\n\n1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:34.260\n There's a similar kind of way of figuring out\n\n1:56:34.260 --> 1:56:37.240\n if you just sort of say, you know,\n\n1:56:37.240 --> 1:56:39.040\n you're making a larger and larger ball\n\n1:56:39.040 --> 1:56:40.920\n or larger and larger, if you draw a circle\n\n1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:42.940\n on the surface of the earth, for example,\n\n1:56:42.940 --> 1:56:45.980\n you might think the area of a circle is pi r squared,\n\n1:56:45.980 --> 1:56:47.940\n but on the surface of the earth,\n\n1:56:47.940 --> 1:56:50.560\n because it's a sphere, it's not flat,\n\n1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:53.360\n the area of a circle isn't precisely pi r squared.\n\n1:56:53.360 --> 1:56:56.240\n As the circle gets bigger, the area is slightly smaller\n\n1:56:56.240 --> 1:56:58.160\n than you would expect from the formula pi r squared\n\n1:56:58.160 --> 1:57:01.040\n as a little correction term that depends on the ratio\n\n1:57:01.040 --> 1:57:03.700\n of the size of the circle to the radius of the earth.\n\n1:57:03.700 --> 1:57:05.680\n Okay, so it's the same basic thing,\n\n1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:08.240\n allows you to measure from one of these hypergraphs\n\n1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:10.100\n what is its effective curvature.\n\n1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:12.080\n And that's...\n\n1:57:12.080 --> 1:57:15.440\n So the little piece of mathematics\n\n1:57:15.440 --> 1:57:18.320\n that explains special general relativity\n\n1:57:20.960 --> 1:57:25.400\n can map nicely to describe fundamental property\n\n1:57:25.400 --> 1:57:27.560\n of the hypergraphs, the curvature of the hypergraphs.\n\n1:57:27.560 --> 1:57:31.280\n So special relativity is about the relationship\n\n1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:32.720\n of time to space.\n\n1:57:32.720 --> 1:57:35.280\n General relativity is about curvature\n\n1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:38.600\n and this space represented by this hypergraph.\n\n1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:40.760\n So what is the curvature of a hypergraph?\n\n1:57:40.760 --> 1:57:43.120\n Okay, so first I have to explain,\n\n1:57:43.120 --> 1:57:44.680\n what we're explaining is,\n\n1:57:44.680 --> 1:57:47.120\n first thing you have to have is a notion of dimension.\n\n1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:49.280\n You don't get to talk about curvature of things.\n\n1:57:49.280 --> 1:57:51.800\n If you say, oh, it's a curved line,\n\n1:57:51.800 --> 1:57:53.800\n but I don't know what a line is yet.\n\n1:57:53.800 --> 1:57:54.640\n So...\n\n1:57:54.640 --> 1:57:56.960\n Yeah, what is the dimension of a hypergraph then?\n\n1:57:56.960 --> 1:58:00.580\n From where, we've talked about effective dimension, but...\n\n1:58:00.580 --> 1:58:03.080\n Right, that's what this is about.\n\n1:58:03.080 --> 1:58:05.180\n What this is about is, you have your hypergraph,\n\n1:58:05.180 --> 1:58:07.380\n it's got a trillion nodes in it.\n\n1:58:07.380 --> 1:58:08.740\n What is it roughly like?\n\n1:58:08.740 --> 1:58:11.460\n Is it roughly like a grid, a two dimensional grid?\n\n1:58:11.460 --> 1:58:15.240\n Is it roughly like all those nodes are arranged online?\n\n1:58:15.240 --> 1:58:16.740\n What's it roughly like?\n\n1:58:16.740 --> 1:58:19.600\n And there's a pretty simple mathematical way\n\n1:58:19.600 --> 1:58:23.960\n to estimate that by just looking at this thing\n\n1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:26.340\n I was describing, this sort of the size of a ball\n\n1:58:26.340 --> 1:58:28.240\n that you construct in the hypergraph.\n\n1:58:28.240 --> 1:58:29.800\n That's a, you just measure that,\n\n1:58:29.800 --> 1:58:33.000\n you can just compute it on a computer for a given hypergraph\n\n1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:35.160\n and you can say, oh, this thing is wiggling around,\n\n1:58:35.160 --> 1:58:38.240\n but it's roughly corresponds to two or something like that,\n\n1:58:38.240 --> 1:58:41.440\n or roughly corresponds to 2.6 or whatever.\n\n1:58:41.440 --> 1:58:44.080\n So that's how you have a notion of dimension\n\n1:58:44.080 --> 1:58:45.640\n in these hypergraphs.\n\n1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:48.600\n Curvature is something a little bit beyond that.\n\n1:58:48.600 --> 1:58:52.120\n If you look at how the size of this ball increases\n\n1:58:52.120 --> 1:58:53.960\n as you increase its radius,\n\n1:58:53.960 --> 1:58:55.400\n curvature is a correction\n\n1:58:55.400 --> 1:58:58.920\n to the size increase associated with dimension.\n\n1:58:58.920 --> 1:59:01.120\n It's a sort of a second order term\n\n1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:03.360\n in determining the size.\n\n1:59:03.360 --> 1:59:07.000\n Just like the area of a circle is roughly pi R squared.\n\n1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:08.520\n So it goes up like R squared.\n\n1:59:08.520 --> 1:59:11.080\n The two is because it's in two dimensions,\n\n1:59:11.080 --> 1:59:14.440\n but when that circle is drawn on a big sphere,\n\n1:59:14.440 --> 1:59:18.320\n the actual formula is pi R squared times one minus\n\n1:59:19.400 --> 1:59:22.640\n R squared over A squared and some coefficient.\n\n1:59:22.640 --> 1:59:25.000\n So in other words, there's a correction to,\n\n1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:28.240\n and that correction term, that gives you curvature.\n\n1:59:28.240 --> 1:59:29.720\n And that correction term\n\n1:59:29.720 --> 1:59:32.880\n is what makes this hypergraph correspond,\n\n1:59:32.880 --> 1:59:35.840\n have the potential to correspond to curved space.\n\n1:59:35.840 --> 1:59:38.480\n Now, the next question is, is that curvature,\n\n1:59:38.480 --> 1:59:40.400\n is the way that curvature works\n\n1:59:40.400 --> 1:59:43.800\n the way that Einstein's equations for general relativity,\n\n1:59:43.800 --> 1:59:46.040\n is it the way they say it should work?\n\n1:59:46.040 --> 1:59:49.160\n And the answer is yes.\n\n1:59:49.160 --> 1:59:52.280\n And so how does that work?\n\n1:59:54.560 --> 1:59:57.240\n The calculation of the curvature of this hypergraph\n\n1:59:57.240 --> 1:59:59.760\n for some set of rules?\n\n1:59:59.760 --> 2:00:01.800\n No, it doesn't matter what the rules are.\n\n2:00:01.800 --> 2:00:03.360\n So long as they have causal invariance\n\n2:00:03.360 --> 2:00:05.440\n and computational irreducibility,\n\n2:00:05.440 --> 2:00:09.360\n and they lead to finite dimensional space,\n\n2:00:09.360 --> 2:00:11.600\n noninfinite dimensional space.\n\n2:00:11.600 --> 2:00:13.600\n Noninfinite dimensional.\n\n2:00:13.600 --> 2:00:14.760\n It can grow infinitely,\n\n2:00:14.760 --> 2:00:16.560\n but it can't be infinite dimensional.\n\n2:00:16.560 --> 2:00:19.840\n So what is a infinitely dimensional hypergraph look like?\n\n2:00:19.840 --> 2:00:22.600\n So that means, for example, so in a tree,\n\n2:00:22.600 --> 2:00:25.400\n you start from one root of the tree,\n\n2:00:25.400 --> 2:00:28.360\n it doubles, doubles again, doubles again, doubles again.\n\n2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:30.720\n And that means if you ask the question,\n\n2:00:30.720 --> 2:00:32.360\n starting from a given point,\n\n2:00:32.360 --> 2:00:34.160\n how many points do you get to?\n\n2:00:34.160 --> 2:00:35.360\n Remember, in like a circle,\n\n2:00:35.360 --> 2:00:37.840\n you get to R squared, the two there.\n\n2:00:37.840 --> 2:00:41.240\n On a tree, you get to, for example, two to the R.\n\n2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:43.320\n It's exponential dimensional, so to speak,\n\n2:00:43.320 --> 2:00:44.360\n or infinite dimensional.\n\n2:00:44.360 --> 2:00:48.480\n Do you have a sense of, in the space of all possible rules,\n\n2:00:48.480 --> 2:00:53.480\n how many lead to infinitely dimensional hypergraphs?\n\n2:00:53.720 --> 2:00:55.280\n Is that? No.\n\n2:00:55.280 --> 2:00:56.120\n Okay.\n\n2:00:56.120 --> 2:00:57.920\n Is that an important thing to know?\n\n2:00:57.920 --> 2:00:59.520\n Yes, it's an important thing to know.\n\n2:00:59.520 --> 2:01:01.560\n I would love to know the answer to that.\n\n2:01:01.560 --> 2:01:03.520\n But it gets a little bit more complicated\n\n2:01:03.520 --> 2:01:05.720\n because, for example, it's very possibly the case\n\n2:01:05.720 --> 2:01:07.440\n that in our physical universe,\n\n2:01:07.440 --> 2:01:10.000\n that the universe started infinite dimensional.\n\n2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:13.800\n And it only, as the Big Bang,\n\n2:01:13.800 --> 2:01:16.080\n it was very likely infinite dimensional.\n\n2:01:16.080 --> 2:01:21.080\n And as the universe sort of expanded and cooled,\n\n2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:23.720\n its dimension gradually went down.\n\n2:01:23.720 --> 2:01:25.400\n And so one of the bizarre possibilities,\n\n2:01:25.400 --> 2:01:27.120\n which actually there are experiments you can do\n\n2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:28.520\n to try and look at this,\n\n2:01:28.520 --> 2:01:31.000\n the universe can have dimension fluctuations.\n\n2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:31.840\n So in other words,\n\n2:01:31.840 --> 2:01:33.400\n we think we live in a three dimensional universe,\n\n2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:35.600\n but actually there may be places\n\n2:01:35.600 --> 2:01:37.920\n where it's actually 3.01 dimensional,\n\n2:01:37.920 --> 2:01:40.520\n or where it's 2.99 dimensional.\n\n2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:43.320\n And it may be that in the very early universe,\n\n2:01:43.320 --> 2:01:45.200\n it was actually infinite dimensional,\n\n2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:47.200\n and it's only a late stage phenomenon\n\n2:01:47.200 --> 2:01:49.240\n that we end up getting three dimensional space.\n\n2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:51.920\n But from your perspective of the hypergraph,\n\n2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:55.240\n one of the underlying assumptions you kind of implied,\n\n2:01:55.240 --> 2:01:59.640\n but you have a sense, a hope set of assumptions\n\n2:01:59.640 --> 2:02:03.120\n that the rules that underlie our universe,\n\n2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:07.240\n or the rule that underlies our universe is static.\n\n2:02:08.200 --> 2:02:10.160\n Is that one of the assumptions\n\n2:02:10.160 --> 2:02:11.840\n you're currently operating under?\n\n2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:14.840\n Yes, but there's a footnote to that,\n\n2:02:14.840 --> 2:02:15.680\n which we should get to,\n\n2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:17.560\n because it requires a few more steps.\n\n2:02:17.560 --> 2:02:19.920\n Well, actually then, let's backtrack to the curvature,\n\n2:02:19.920 --> 2:02:23.120\n because we're talking about as long as it's finite dimensional.\n\n2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:28.000\n Finite dimensional computational irreducibility\n\n2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:29.680\n and causal invariance,\n\n2:02:29.680 --> 2:02:34.680\n then it follows that the large scale structure\n\n2:02:35.800 --> 2:02:37.880\n will follow Einstein's equations.\n\n2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:40.720\n And now let me again, qualify that a little bit more,\n\n2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:43.120\n there's a little bit more complexity to it.\n\n2:02:43.120 --> 2:02:48.120\n The, okay, so Einstein's equations in their simplest form\n\n2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:51.720\n apply to the vacuum, no matter, just the vacuum.\n\n2:02:51.720 --> 2:02:54.200\n And they say, in particular, what they say is,\n\n2:02:54.200 --> 2:02:58.520\n if you have, so there's this term GD6,\n\n2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:00.920\n that's a term that means shortest path,\n\n2:03:00.920 --> 2:03:03.680\n comes from measuring the shortest paths on the Earth.\n\n2:03:03.680 --> 2:03:07.600\n So you look at a bunch of, a bundle of GD6,\n\n2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:09.520\n a bunch of shortest paths,\n\n2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:11.040\n it's like the paths that photons\n\n2:03:11.040 --> 2:03:13.040\n would take between two points.\n\n2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:14.960\n Then the statement of Einstein's equations,\n\n2:03:14.960 --> 2:03:18.040\n it's basically a statement about a certain the,\n\n2:03:18.040 --> 2:03:20.360\n that as you look at a bundle of GD6,\n\n2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:22.920\n the structure of space has to be such that,\n\n2:03:22.920 --> 2:03:27.800\n although the cross sectional area of this bundle may,\n\n2:03:27.800 --> 2:03:30.000\n although the actual shape of the cross section may change,\n\n2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:31.800\n the cross sectional area does not.\n\n2:03:31.800 --> 2:03:35.280\n That's a version, that's the most simple minded version\n\n2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:38.960\n of R mu nu minus a half R G mu nu equals zero,\n\n2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:41.040\n which is the more mathematical version\n\n2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:42.440\n of Einstein's equations.\n\n2:03:42.440 --> 2:03:45.360\n It's a statement of the thing called the Ritchie tensor\n\n2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:46.840\n is equal to zero.\n\n2:03:46.840 --> 2:03:50.080\n That's Einstein's equations for the vacuum.\n\n2:03:50.080 --> 2:03:54.400\n Okay, so we get that as a result of this model,\n\n2:03:54.400 --> 2:03:57.840\n but footnote, big footnote,\n\n2:03:57.840 --> 2:04:00.280\n because all the matter in the universe\n\n2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:01.680\n is the stuff we actually care about.\n\n2:04:01.680 --> 2:04:03.560\n The vacuum is not stuff we care about.\n\n2:04:03.560 --> 2:04:06.440\n So the question is, how does matter come into this?\n\n2:04:06.440 --> 2:04:09.720\n And for that, you have to understand what energy is\n\n2:04:09.720 --> 2:04:11.120\n in these models.\n\n2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:15.280\n And one of the things that we realized, you know,\n\n2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:20.280\n late last year was that there's a very simple interpretation\n\n2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:22.560\n of energy in these models, okay?\n\n2:04:22.560 --> 2:04:27.560\n And energy is basically, well, intuitively,\n\n2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:32.720\n it's the amount of activity in these hypergraphs\n\n2:04:32.720 --> 2:04:36.840\n and the way that that remains over time.\n\n2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:38.640\n So a little bit more formally,\n\n2:04:38.640 --> 2:04:41.560\n you can think about this causal graph\n\n2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:44.880\n as having these edges that represent causal relationships.\n\n2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:46.120\n You can think about, oh boy,\n\n2:04:46.120 --> 2:04:47.920\n there's one more concept that we didn't get to.\n\n2:04:47.920 --> 2:04:51.800\n It's the notion of space like hypersurfaces.\n\n2:04:51.800 --> 2:04:55.800\n So this is not as scary as it sounds.\n\n2:04:55.800 --> 2:04:59.720\n It's a common notion in general activity.\n\n2:04:59.720 --> 2:05:04.720\n The notion is you are defining what is a possibly,\n\n2:05:04.720 --> 2:05:09.720\n where in space time might be a particular moment in time.\n\n2:05:13.960 --> 2:05:18.200\n So in other words, what is a consistent set of places\n\n2:05:18.200 --> 2:05:21.760\n where you can say, this is happening now, so to speak.\n\n2:05:21.760 --> 2:05:25.600\n And you make the series of sort of slices\n\n2:05:25.600 --> 2:05:29.200\n through the space time, through this causal graph\n\n2:05:29.200 --> 2:05:32.000\n to represent sort of what we consider\n\n2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:34.680\n to be successive moments in time.\n\n2:05:34.680 --> 2:05:37.720\n It's somewhat arbitrary because you can deform that\n\n2:05:37.720 --> 2:05:39.880\n if you're going at a different speed in a special activity,\n\n2:05:39.880 --> 2:05:44.520\n you tip those things, there are different kinds\n\n2:05:44.520 --> 2:05:46.800\n of deformations, but only certain deformations\n\n2:05:46.800 --> 2:05:48.400\n are allowed by the structure of the causal graph.\n\n2:05:48.400 --> 2:05:52.360\n Anyway, be that as it may, the basic point is\n\n2:05:52.360 --> 2:05:54.880\n there is a way of figuring out,\n\n2:05:54.880 --> 2:05:57.120\n you say, what is the energy associated\n\n2:05:57.120 --> 2:06:00.400\n with what's going on in this hypergraph?\n\n2:06:00.400 --> 2:06:04.360\n And the answer is there is a precise definition of that.\n\n2:06:04.360 --> 2:06:06.840\n And it is the formal way to say it is,\n\n2:06:06.840 --> 2:06:08.560\n it's the flux of causal edges\n\n2:06:08.560 --> 2:06:10.680\n through space like hypersurfaces.\n\n2:06:10.680 --> 2:06:12.280\n The slightly less formal way to say it,\n\n2:06:12.280 --> 2:06:14.480\n it's basically the amount of activity.\n\n2:06:14.480 --> 2:06:18.000\n See, the reason it gets tricky is you might say\n\n2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:21.000\n it's the amount of activity per unit volume\n\n2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:25.280\n in this hypergraph, but you haven't defined what volume is.\n\n2:06:25.280 --> 2:06:27.520\n So it's a little bit, you have to be a little more careful.\n\n2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:30.600\n But this hypersurface gives some more formalism to that.\n\n2:06:30.600 --> 2:06:32.840\n Yeah, yeah, it gives a way to connect that.\n\n2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:36.400\n But intuitive, we should think about as the just activity.\n\n2:06:36.400 --> 2:06:39.640\n Right, so the amount of activity that kind of remains\n\n2:06:39.640 --> 2:06:42.800\n in one place in the hypergraph corresponds to energy.\n\n2:06:42.800 --> 2:06:45.800\n The amount of activity that is kind of where an activity here\n\n2:06:45.800 --> 2:06:48.160\n affects an activity somewhere else,\n\n2:06:48.160 --> 2:06:50.480\n corresponds to momentum.\n\n2:06:50.480 --> 2:06:53.840\n And so one of the things that's kind of cool\n\n2:06:53.840 --> 2:06:55.600\n is that I'm trying to think about\n\n2:06:55.600 --> 2:06:56.680\n how to say this intuitively.\n\n2:06:56.680 --> 2:06:57.720\n The mathematics is easy,\n\n2:06:57.720 --> 2:06:59.800\n but the intuitive version, I'm not sure.\n\n2:06:59.800 --> 2:07:01.640\n But basically the way that things sort of stay\n\n2:07:01.640 --> 2:07:03.960\n in the same place and have activity\n\n2:07:03.960 --> 2:07:05.920\n is associated with rest mass.\n\n2:07:05.920 --> 2:07:08.080\n And so one of the things that you get to derive\n\n2:07:08.080 --> 2:07:09.880\n is E equals MC squared.\n\n2:07:10.800 --> 2:07:14.840\n That is a consequence of this interpretation of energy\n\n2:07:14.840 --> 2:07:18.040\n in terms of the way the causal graph works,\n\n2:07:18.040 --> 2:07:20.160\n which is the whole thing is sort of a consequence\n\n2:07:20.160 --> 2:07:23.720\n of this whole story about updates and hypergraphs and so on.\n\n2:07:23.720 --> 2:07:26.280\n So can you linger on that a little bit?\n\n2:07:26.280 --> 2:07:28.840\n How do we get E equals MC squared?\n\n2:07:28.840 --> 2:07:31.280\n So where does the mass come from?\n\n2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:32.240\n Okay, okay.\n\n2:07:32.240 --> 2:07:35.000\n I mean, is there an intuitive, it's okay.\n\n2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:37.720\n First of all, you're pretty deep\n\n2:07:37.720 --> 2:07:41.600\n in the mathematical explorations of this thing right now.\n\n2:07:41.600 --> 2:07:45.920\n We're in a very, we're in a flux currently.\n\n2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:47.960\n So maybe you haven't even had time\n\n2:07:47.960 --> 2:07:51.680\n to think about intuitive explanations, but.\n\n2:07:51.680 --> 2:07:56.320\n Yeah, I mean, this one is, look, roughly what's happening,\n\n2:07:56.320 --> 2:07:58.400\n that derivation is actually rather easy.\n\n2:07:58.400 --> 2:07:59.840\n And everybody, and I've been saying\n\n2:07:59.840 --> 2:08:01.600\n we should pay more attention to this derivation\n\n2:08:01.600 --> 2:08:02.480\n because it's such, you know,\n\n2:08:02.480 --> 2:08:04.320\n cause people care about this one.\n\n2:08:04.320 --> 2:08:05.880\n But everybody says, it's just easy.\n\n2:08:05.880 --> 2:08:07.200\n It's easy.\n\n2:08:07.200 --> 2:08:09.320\n So there's some concept of energy\n\n2:08:09.320 --> 2:08:12.880\n that can be intuitively thought of as the activity,\n\n2:08:12.880 --> 2:08:16.760\n the flux, the level of changes that are occurring\n\n2:08:16.760 --> 2:08:19.400\n based on the transformations within a certain volume,\n\n2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:21.240\n however the heck do you find the volume.\n\n2:08:21.240 --> 2:08:23.560\n Okay, so, and then mass.\n\n2:08:23.560 --> 2:08:28.560\n Well, mass is associated with kind of the energy\n\n2:08:28.560 --> 2:08:30.440\n that does not cause you to,\n\n2:08:30.440 --> 2:08:34.000\n that does not somehow propagate through time.\n\n2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:35.960\n Yeah, I mean, one of the things that was not obvious\n\n2:08:35.960 --> 2:08:38.400\n in the usual formulation of special relativity\n\n2:08:38.400 --> 2:08:42.800\n is that space and time are connected in a certain way.\n\n2:08:42.800 --> 2:08:46.280\n Energy and momentum are also connected in a certain way.\n\n2:08:46.280 --> 2:08:49.080\n The fact that the connection of energy to momentum\n\n2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:50.800\n is analogous to the connection to space\n\n2:08:50.800 --> 2:08:52.400\n between space and time\n\n2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:54.920\n is not self evident in ordinary relativity.\n\n2:08:54.920 --> 2:08:58.360\n It is a consequence of this, of the way this model works.\n\n2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:00.960\n It's an intrinsic consequence of the way this model works.\n\n2:09:00.960 --> 2:09:02.800\n And it's all to do with that,\n\n2:09:02.800 --> 2:09:05.240\n with unraveling that connection\n\n2:09:05.240 --> 2:09:07.720\n that ends up giving you this relationship\n\n2:09:07.720 --> 2:09:12.480\n between energy and, well, it's energy, momentum, mass,\n\n2:09:12.480 --> 2:09:13.760\n they're all connected.\n\n2:09:13.760 --> 2:09:18.760\n And so like, that's hence the general relativity.\n\n2:09:19.560 --> 2:09:24.560\n You have a sense that it appears to be baked in\n\n2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:27.000\n to the fundamental properties\n\n2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:29.320\n of the way these hypergraphs are evolved.\n\n2:09:29.320 --> 2:09:30.360\n Well, I didn't yet get to,\n\n2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:33.680\n so I got as far as special relativity and equals MC squared.\n\n2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:37.320\n The one last step is, in general relativity,\n\n2:09:37.320 --> 2:09:41.800\n the final connection is energy and mass\n\n2:09:41.800 --> 2:09:44.440\n cause curvature in space.\n\n2:09:44.440 --> 2:09:47.720\n And that's something that when you understand\n\n2:09:47.720 --> 2:09:49.760\n this interpretation of energy,\n\n2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:52.080\n and you kind of understand the correspondence\n\n2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:54.000\n to curvature and hypergraphs,\n\n2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:57.640\n then you can finally sort of, the big final answer is,\n\n2:09:57.640 --> 2:10:00.440\n you derive the full version of Einstein's equations\n\n2:10:00.440 --> 2:10:03.320\n for space, time and matter.\n\n2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:04.480\n And that's some.\n\n2:10:04.480 --> 2:10:09.480\n Is that, have you, that last piece with curvature,\n\n2:10:09.520 --> 2:10:12.320\n have, is that, have you arrived there yet?\n\n2:10:12.320 --> 2:10:13.760\n Oh yeah, we're there, yes.\n\n2:10:13.760 --> 2:10:15.480\n And here's the way that we,\n\n2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:17.200\n here's how we're really, really going to know\n\n2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:18.480\n we've arrived, okay?\n\n2:10:18.480 --> 2:10:20.720\n So, you know, we have the mathematical derivation,\n\n2:10:20.720 --> 2:10:22.720\n it's all fine, but, you know,\n\n2:10:22.720 --> 2:10:25.000\n mathematical derivations, okay.\n\n2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:27.720\n So one thing that's sort of a,\n\n2:10:27.720 --> 2:10:29.240\n you know, we're taking this limit\n\n2:10:29.240 --> 2:10:31.160\n of what happens when you, the limit,\n\n2:10:31.160 --> 2:10:32.920\n you have to look at things which are large\n\n2:10:32.920 --> 2:10:35.240\n compared to the size of an elementary length,\n\n2:10:35.240 --> 2:10:37.440\n small compared to the whole size of the universe,\n\n2:10:37.440 --> 2:10:40.480\n large compared to certain kinds of fluctuations,\n\n2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:41.600\n blah, blah, blah.\n\n2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:43.360\n There's a, there's a, there's a tower\n\n2:10:43.360 --> 2:10:45.160\n of many, many of these mathematical limits\n\n2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:46.440\n that have to be taken.\n\n2:10:46.440 --> 2:10:48.720\n So if you're a pure mathematician saying,\n\n2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:50.520\n where's the precise proof?\n\n2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:52.480\n It's like, well, there are all these limits,\n\n2:10:52.480 --> 2:10:54.880\n we can, you know, we can try each one of them\n\n2:10:54.880 --> 2:10:57.520\n computationally and we could say, yeah, it really works,\n\n2:10:57.520 --> 2:11:00.560\n but the formal mathematics is really hard to do.\n\n2:11:00.560 --> 2:11:03.120\n I mean, for example, in the case of deriving\n\n2:11:03.120 --> 2:11:06.200\n the equations of fluid dynamics from molecular dynamics,\n\n2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:08.040\n that derivation has never been done.\n\n2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:11.360\n There is no rigorous version of that derivation.\n\n2:11:11.360 --> 2:11:12.200\n So, so that could be.\n\n2:11:12.200 --> 2:11:13.760\n Because you can't do the limits?\n\n2:11:13.760 --> 2:11:15.920\n Yeah, because you can't do the limits.\n\n2:11:15.920 --> 2:11:18.320\n But so the limits allow you to try to describe\n\n2:11:18.320 --> 2:11:20.280\n something general about the system\n\n2:11:20.280 --> 2:11:22.520\n and very, very particular kinds of limits that you need\n\n2:11:22.520 --> 2:11:23.640\n to take with these very.\n\n2:11:23.640 --> 2:11:26.000\n Right, and the limits will definitely work\n\n2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:27.200\n the way we think they work.\n\n2:11:27.200 --> 2:11:28.760\n And we can do all kinds of computer experiments.\n\n2:11:28.760 --> 2:11:29.760\n It's just a hard derivation.\n\n2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:32.760\n Yeah, it's just, it's just the mathematical structure\n\n2:11:32.760 --> 2:11:35.240\n kind of, you know, ends up running right into\n\n2:11:35.240 --> 2:11:37.080\n computational irreducibility.\n\n2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:39.560\n And you end up with a bunch of, a bunch of difficulty there.\n\n2:11:39.560 --> 2:11:42.320\n But here's the way that we're getting really confident\n\n2:11:42.320 --> 2:11:43.960\n that we know completely what we're talking about,\n\n2:11:43.960 --> 2:11:47.880\n which is when people study things like black hole mergers,\n\n2:11:47.880 --> 2:11:51.000\n using Einstein's equations, what do they actually do?\n\n2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:52.800\n Well, they actually use Mathematica or a whole bunch\n\n2:11:52.800 --> 2:11:54.440\n to analyze the equations and so on.\n\n2:11:54.440 --> 2:11:57.360\n But in the end, they do numerical relativity,\n\n2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:01.440\n which means they take these nice mathematical equations\n\n2:12:01.440 --> 2:12:03.280\n and they break them down so that they can run them\n\n2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:04.360\n on a computer.\n\n2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:05.920\n And they break them down into something\n\n2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:07.680\n which is actually a discrete approximation\n\n2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:08.920\n to these equations.\n\n2:12:08.920 --> 2:12:11.560\n Then they run them on a computer, they get results.\n\n2:12:11.560 --> 2:12:12.880\n Then you look at the gravitational waves\n\n2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:14.840\n and you see if they match, okay?\n\n2:12:14.840 --> 2:12:18.240\n It turns out that our model gives you a direct way\n\n2:12:18.240 --> 2:12:19.800\n to do numerical relativity.\n\n2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:21.120\n So in other words, instead of saying,\n\n2:12:21.120 --> 2:12:23.960\n you start from these continuum equations from Einstein,\n\n2:12:23.960 --> 2:12:26.280\n you break them down into these discrete things,\n\n2:12:26.280 --> 2:12:27.600\n you run them on a computer,\n\n2:12:27.600 --> 2:12:28.920\n you say, we're doing it the other way around.\n\n2:12:28.920 --> 2:12:30.680\n We're starting from these discrete things\n\n2:12:30.680 --> 2:12:31.880\n that come from our model.\n\n2:12:31.880 --> 2:12:34.520\n And we're just running big versions on the computer.\n\n2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:37.080\n And, you know, what we're saying is,\n\n2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:39.560\n and this is how things will work.\n\n2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:43.760\n So the way I'm calling this is proof by compilation,\n\n2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:46.480\n so to speak, that is, in other words,\n\n2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:49.320\n you're taking something where, you know,\n\n2:12:49.320 --> 2:12:52.320\n we've got this description of a black hole system.\n\n2:12:52.320 --> 2:12:56.120\n And what we're doing is we're showing that the, you know,\n\n2:12:56.120 --> 2:12:59.320\n what we get by just running our model agrees\n\n2:12:59.320 --> 2:13:02.720\n with what you would get by doing the computation\n\n2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:04.320\n from the Einstein equations.\n\n2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:08.360\n As a small tangent or actually a very big tangent,\n\n2:13:08.360 --> 2:13:13.360\n but proof by compilation is a beautiful concept.\n\n2:13:15.200 --> 2:13:20.200\n In a sense, the way of doing physics with this model\n\n2:13:21.400 --> 2:13:26.040\n is by running it or compiling it.\n\n2:13:26.040 --> 2:13:29.800\n And have you thought about,\n\n2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:32.000\n and these things can be very large,\n\n2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:37.000\n is there a totally new possibilities of computing hardware\n\n2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:38.960\n and computing software,\n\n2:13:38.960 --> 2:13:42.200\n which allows you to perform this kind of compilation?\n\n2:13:42.200 --> 2:13:44.920\n Well, algorithms, software, hardware.\n\n2:13:44.920 --> 2:13:49.440\n So first comment is these models seem to give one\n\n2:13:49.440 --> 2:13:52.480\n a lot of intuition about distributed computing,\n\n2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:54.680\n a lot of different intuition about how to think\n\n2:13:54.680 --> 2:13:56.640\n about parallel computation.\n\n2:13:56.640 --> 2:13:58.960\n And that particularly comes from the quantum mechanics\n\n2:13:58.960 --> 2:14:01.880\n side of things, which we didn't talk about much yet.\n\n2:14:01.880 --> 2:14:04.720\n But the question of what, you know,\n\n2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:07.760\n given our current computer hardware,\n\n2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:10.120\n how can we most efficiently simulate things?\n\n2:14:10.120 --> 2:14:12.920\n That's actually partly a story of the model itself,\n\n2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:16.160\n because the model itself has deep parallelism in it.\n\n2:14:16.160 --> 2:14:17.760\n The ways that we are simulating it,\n\n2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:21.080\n we're just starting to be able to use that deep parallelism\n\n2:14:21.080 --> 2:14:22.600\n to be able to be more efficient\n\n2:14:22.600 --> 2:14:24.400\n in the way that we simulate things.\n\n2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:27.880\n But in fact, the structure of the model itself\n\n2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:30.280\n allows us to think about parallel computation\n\n2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:31.520\n in different ways.\n\n2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:34.600\n And one of my realizations is that, you know,\n\n2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:37.000\n so it's very hard to get in your brain\n\n2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:38.520\n how you deal with parallel computation.\n\n2:14:38.520 --> 2:14:40.240\n And you're always worrying about, you know,\n\n2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:42.720\n if multiple things can happen on different computers\n\n2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:44.640\n at different times, oh, what happens\n\n2:14:44.640 --> 2:14:46.440\n if this thing happens before that thing?\n\n2:14:46.440 --> 2:14:47.520\n And we've really got, you know,\n\n2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:49.720\n we have these race conditions where something can race\n\n2:14:49.720 --> 2:14:51.800\n to get to the answer before another thing.\n\n2:14:51.800 --> 2:14:54.040\n And you get all tangled up because you don't know\n\n2:14:54.040 --> 2:14:55.960\n which thing is gonna come in first.\n\n2:14:55.960 --> 2:14:58.320\n And usually when you do parallel computing,\n\n2:14:58.320 --> 2:15:00.480\n there's a big obsession to lock things down\n\n2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:03.920\n to the point where you've had locks and mutexes\n\n2:15:03.920 --> 2:15:05.240\n and God knows what else,\n\n2:15:05.240 --> 2:15:09.600\n where you've arranged it so that there can only be\n\n2:15:09.600 --> 2:15:11.560\n one sequence of things that can happen.\n\n2:15:11.560 --> 2:15:12.640\n So you don't have to think about\n\n2:15:12.640 --> 2:15:14.760\n all the different kinds of things that can happen.\n\n2:15:14.760 --> 2:15:18.200\n Well, in these models, physics is throwing us into,\n\n2:15:18.200 --> 2:15:20.240\n forcing us to think about all these possible things\n\n2:15:20.240 --> 2:15:21.240\n that can happen.\n\n2:15:21.240 --> 2:15:24.640\n But these models together with what we know from physics\n\n2:15:24.640 --> 2:15:26.520\n is giving us new ways to think about\n\n2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:28.560\n all possible things happening,\n\n2:15:28.560 --> 2:15:30.680\n about all these different things happening in parallel.\n\n2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:31.680\n And so I'm guessing...\n\n2:15:31.680 --> 2:15:34.640\n They have built in protection for some of the parallelism.\n\n2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:37.280\n Well, causal invariance is the built in protection.\n\n2:15:37.280 --> 2:15:39.720\n Causal invariance is what means that\n\n2:15:39.720 --> 2:15:41.680\n even though things happen in different orders,\n\n2:15:41.680 --> 2:15:43.440\n it doesn't matter in the end.\n\n2:15:43.440 --> 2:15:46.520\n As a person who struggled with concurrent programming\n\n2:15:46.520 --> 2:15:50.240\n in like Java,\n\n2:15:50.240 --> 2:15:53.760\n with all the basic concepts of concurrent programming,\n\n2:15:53.760 --> 2:15:55.760\n that if there could be built up\n\n2:15:55.760 --> 2:16:00.080\n a strong mathematical framework for causal invariance,\n\n2:16:00.080 --> 2:16:01.760\n that's so liberating.\n\n2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:03.680\n And that could be not just liberating,\n\n2:16:03.680 --> 2:16:08.320\n but really powerful for massively distributed computation.\n\n2:16:08.320 --> 2:16:09.160\n Absolutely.\n\n2:16:09.160 --> 2:16:11.800\n No, I mean, what's eventual consistency\n\n2:16:11.800 --> 2:16:14.000\n in distributed databases\n\n2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:16.160\n is essentially the causal invariance idea.\n\n2:16:16.160 --> 2:16:17.000\n Yeah. Okay.\n\n2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:17.840\n So that's...\n\n2:16:17.840 --> 2:16:19.760\n But have you thought about,\n\n2:16:22.160 --> 2:16:26.000\n like really large simulations?\n\n2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:28.080\n Yeah. I mean, I'm also thinking about,\n\n2:16:28.080 --> 2:16:30.400\n look, the fact is I've spent much of my life\n\n2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:31.640\n as a language designer, right?\n\n2:16:31.640 --> 2:16:34.360\n So I can't possibly not think about,\n\n2:16:34.360 --> 2:16:37.240\n what does this mean for designing languages\n\n2:16:37.240 --> 2:16:38.320\n for parallel computation?\n\n2:16:38.320 --> 2:16:41.640\n In fact, another thing that's one of these...\n\n2:16:41.640 --> 2:16:44.400\n I'm always embarrassed at how long it's taken me\n\n2:16:44.400 --> 2:16:45.680\n to figure stuff out.\n\n2:16:45.680 --> 2:16:47.360\n But back in the 1980s,\n\n2:16:47.360 --> 2:16:49.600\n I worked on trying to make up languages\n\n2:16:49.600 --> 2:16:50.960\n for parallel computation.\n\n2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:53.080\n I thought about doing graph rewriting.\n\n2:16:53.080 --> 2:16:54.440\n I thought about doing these kinds of things,\n\n2:16:54.440 --> 2:16:57.160\n but I couldn't see how to actually make the connections\n\n2:16:57.160 --> 2:16:59.320\n to actually do something useful.\n\n2:16:59.320 --> 2:17:02.520\n I think now physics is kind of showing us\n\n2:17:02.520 --> 2:17:04.200\n how to make those things useful.\n\n2:17:04.200 --> 2:17:06.320\n And so my guess is that in time,\n\n2:17:06.320 --> 2:17:09.000\n we'll be talking about, we do parallel programming.\n\n2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:10.360\n We'll be talking about programming\n\n2:17:10.360 --> 2:17:12.080\n in a certain reference frame,\n\n2:17:12.080 --> 2:17:14.120\n just as we think about thinking about physics\n\n2:17:14.120 --> 2:17:15.080\n in a certain reference frame.\n\n2:17:15.080 --> 2:17:17.640\n It's a certain coordination of what's going on.\n\n2:17:17.640 --> 2:17:19.960\n We say, we're gonna program in this reference frame.\n\n2:17:19.960 --> 2:17:21.280\n Oh, let's change the reference frame\n\n2:17:21.280 --> 2:17:22.680\n to this reference frame.\n\n2:17:22.680 --> 2:17:25.240\n And then our program will seem different\n\n2:17:25.240 --> 2:17:27.120\n and we'll have a different way to think about it.\n\n2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:28.960\n But it's still the same program underneath.\n\n2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:30.760\n So let me ask on this topic,\n\n2:17:30.760 --> 2:17:32.360\n cause I put out that I'm talking to you.\n\n2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:34.560\n I got way more questions than I can deal with,\n\n2:17:34.560 --> 2:17:37.520\n but what pops to mind is a question somebody asked\n\n2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:42.520\n on Reddit I think is, please ask Dr. Wolfram,\n\n2:17:42.560 --> 2:17:46.200\n what are the specs of the computer running the universe?\n\n2:17:46.200 --> 2:17:51.200\n So we're talking about specs of hardware and software\n\n2:17:51.480 --> 2:17:54.080\n for simulations of a large scale thing.\n\n2:17:54.080 --> 2:17:57.520\n What about a scale that is comparative\n\n2:17:57.520 --> 2:17:59.720\n to something that eventually leads\n\n2:17:59.720 --> 2:18:01.560\n to the two of us talking and about?\n\n2:18:01.560 --> 2:18:02.400\n Right, right, right.\n\n2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:05.080\n So actually I did try to estimate that.\n\n2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:07.280\n And we actually have to go a couple more stages\n\n2:18:07.280 --> 2:18:08.680\n before we can really get to that answer\n\n2:18:08.680 --> 2:18:13.680\n because we're talking about this thing.\n\n2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:16.920\n This is what happens when you build these abstract systems\n\n2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:19.560\n and you're trying to explain the universe,\n\n2:18:19.560 --> 2:18:23.640\n they're quite a number of levels deep, so to speak.\n\n2:18:23.640 --> 2:18:25.520\n But the...\n\n2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:27.280\n You mean conceptually or like literally?\n\n2:18:27.280 --> 2:18:28.800\n Cause you're talking about small objects\n\n2:18:28.800 --> 2:18:31.600\n and there's 10 to the 120 something.\n\n2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:32.440\n Yeah, right.\n\n2:18:33.840 --> 2:18:35.120\n It is conceptually deep.\n\n2:18:35.120 --> 2:18:37.920\n And one of the things that's happening sort of structurally\n\n2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:40.600\n in this project is, you know, there were ideas,\n\n2:18:40.600 --> 2:18:41.760\n there's another layer of ideas,\n\n2:18:41.760 --> 2:18:43.240\n there's another layer of ideas\n\n2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:46.960\n to get to the different things that correspond to physics.\n\n2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:49.280\n They're just different layers of ideas.\n\n2:18:49.280 --> 2:18:52.360\n And they are, you know, it's actually probably,\n\n2:18:52.360 --> 2:18:54.480\n if anything, getting harder to explain this project\n\n2:18:54.480 --> 2:18:56.520\n cause I'm realizing that the fraction of way through\n\n2:18:56.520 --> 2:18:59.760\n that I am so far and explaining this to you is less than,\n\n2:18:59.760 --> 2:19:02.840\n than, you know, it might be because we know more now,\n\n2:19:02.840 --> 2:19:06.200\n you know, every week basically we know a little bit more.\n\n2:19:06.200 --> 2:19:07.040\n And like...\n\n2:19:07.040 --> 2:19:10.480\n Those are just layers on the initial fundamental structure.\n\n2:19:10.480 --> 2:19:12.640\n Yes, but the layers are, you know,\n\n2:19:12.640 --> 2:19:14.320\n you might be asking me, you know,\n\n2:19:14.320 --> 2:19:18.680\n how do we get the difference between fermions and bosons,\n\n2:19:18.680 --> 2:19:19.880\n the difference between particles\n\n2:19:19.880 --> 2:19:21.760\n that can be all in the same state\n\n2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:24.080\n and particles that exclude each other, okay.\n\n2:19:24.080 --> 2:19:26.600\n Last three days, we've kind of figured that out.\n\n2:19:26.600 --> 2:19:27.440\n Okay.\n\n2:19:27.440 --> 2:19:29.440\n But, and it's very interesting.\n\n2:19:29.440 --> 2:19:31.080\n It's very cool.\n\n2:19:31.080 --> 2:19:32.040\n And it's very...\n\n2:19:32.040 --> 2:19:35.800\n And those are some kind of properties at a certain level,\n\n2:19:35.800 --> 2:19:37.880\n layer of abstraction on the graph.\n\n2:19:37.880 --> 2:19:38.720\n Yes, yes.\n\n2:19:38.720 --> 2:19:41.640\n And there's, but the layers of abstraction are kind of,\n\n2:19:41.640 --> 2:19:42.760\n they're compounding.\n\n2:19:42.760 --> 2:19:43.600\n Stacking up.\n\n2:19:43.600 --> 2:19:45.320\n So it's difficult, but...\n\n2:19:45.320 --> 2:19:46.160\n But okay.\n\n2:19:46.160 --> 2:19:47.920\n But the specs nevertheless remain the same.\n\n2:19:47.920 --> 2:19:49.560\n Okay, the specs underneath.\n\n2:19:49.560 --> 2:19:50.960\n So I have an estimate.\n\n2:19:50.960 --> 2:19:52.440\n So the question is, what are the units?\n\n2:19:52.440 --> 2:19:54.840\n So we've got these different fundamental constants\n\n2:19:54.840 --> 2:19:56.160\n about the world.\n\n2:19:56.160 --> 2:19:58.520\n So one of them is the speed of light, which is the...\n\n2:19:58.520 --> 2:20:00.200\n So the thing that's always the same\n\n2:20:00.200 --> 2:20:02.720\n in all these different ways of thinking about the universe\n\n2:20:02.720 --> 2:20:06.200\n is the notion of time, because time is computation.\n\n2:20:06.200 --> 2:20:08.080\n And so there's an elementary time,\n\n2:20:08.080 --> 2:20:12.240\n which is sort of the amount of time that we ascribe\n\n2:20:12.240 --> 2:20:16.160\n to elapsing in a single computational step.\n\n2:20:16.160 --> 2:20:17.000\n Yeah.\n\n2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:17.840\n Okay.\n\n2:20:17.840 --> 2:20:18.680\n So that's the elementary time.\n\n2:20:18.680 --> 2:20:19.520\n So then there's an elementary...\n\n2:20:19.520 --> 2:20:20.440\n That's a parameter or whatever.\n\n2:20:20.440 --> 2:20:21.880\n That's a constant.\n\n2:20:21.880 --> 2:20:23.360\n It's whatever we define it to be,\n\n2:20:23.360 --> 2:20:25.360\n because I mean, we don't, you know...\n\n2:20:25.360 --> 2:20:26.840\n I mean, it's all relative, right?\n\n2:20:26.840 --> 2:20:27.680\n It doesn't matter.\n\n2:20:27.680 --> 2:20:28.520\n Yes, it doesn't matter what it is,\n\n2:20:28.520 --> 2:20:30.360\n because we could be, it could be slower.\n\n2:20:30.360 --> 2:20:33.840\n It's just a number which we use to convert that\n\n2:20:33.840 --> 2:20:35.000\n to seconds, so to speak,\n\n2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:37.160\n because we are experiencing things\n\n2:20:37.160 --> 2:20:39.880\n and we say this amount of time has elapsed, so to speak.\n\n2:20:39.880 --> 2:20:41.400\n But we're within this thing.\n\n2:20:41.400 --> 2:20:42.240\n Absolutely.\n\n2:20:42.240 --> 2:20:43.680\n So it doesn't matter, right?\n\n2:20:43.680 --> 2:20:46.000\n But what does matter is the ratio,\n\n2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:49.520\n what we can, the ratio of the spatial distance\n\n2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:54.320\n and this hypergraph to this moment of time.\n\n2:20:54.320 --> 2:20:55.800\n Again, that's an arbitrary thing,\n\n2:20:55.800 --> 2:20:58.720\n but we measure that in meters per second, for example,\n\n2:20:58.720 --> 2:21:00.880\n and that ratio is the speed of light.\n\n2:21:00.880 --> 2:21:03.160\n So the ratio of the elementary distance\n\n2:21:03.160 --> 2:21:06.640\n to the elementary time is the speed of light, okay?\n\n2:21:06.640 --> 2:21:07.480\n Perfect.\n\n2:21:07.480 --> 2:21:08.320\n And so there's another,\n\n2:21:08.320 --> 2:21:11.360\n there are two other levels of this, okay?\n\n2:21:11.360 --> 2:21:13.880\n So there is a thing which we can talk about,\n\n2:21:13.880 --> 2:21:16.520\n which is the maximum entanglement speed,\n\n2:21:16.520 --> 2:21:19.320\n which is a thing that happens at another level\n\n2:21:19.320 --> 2:21:20.680\n in this whole sort of story\n\n2:21:20.680 --> 2:21:22.840\n of how these things get constructed.\n\n2:21:22.840 --> 2:21:24.840\n That's a sort of maximum speed in quantum,\n\n2:21:24.840 --> 2:21:26.920\n in the space of quantum states.\n\n2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:28.040\n Just as the speed of light\n\n2:21:28.040 --> 2:21:30.200\n is a maximum speed in physical space,\n\n2:21:30.200 --> 2:21:32.680\n this is a maximum speed in the space of quantum states.\n\n2:21:32.680 --> 2:21:35.000\n There's another level which is associated\n\n2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:36.600\n with what we call ruleal space,\n\n2:21:36.600 --> 2:21:39.120\n which is another one of these maximum speeds.\n\n2:21:39.120 --> 2:21:40.360\n We'll get to this.\n\n2:21:40.360 --> 2:21:42.120\n So these are limitations on the system\n\n2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:45.280\n that are able to capture the kind of physical universe\n\n2:21:45.280 --> 2:21:46.280\n which we live in.\n\n2:21:46.280 --> 2:21:47.120\n The quantum mechanical.\n\n2:21:47.120 --> 2:21:51.800\n There are inevitable features of having a rule\n\n2:21:51.800 --> 2:21:54.600\n that has only a finite amount of information in the rule.\n\n2:21:54.600 --> 2:21:57.280\n So long as you have a rule that only involves\n\n2:21:57.280 --> 2:22:01.560\n a bounded amount, a limited amount of,\n\n2:22:01.560 --> 2:22:03.280\n only involving a limited number of elements,\n\n2:22:03.280 --> 2:22:04.760\n limited number of relations,\n\n2:22:04.760 --> 2:22:07.320\n it is inevitable that there are these speed constraints.\n\n2:22:07.320 --> 2:22:08.800\n We knew about the one for speed of light.\n\n2:22:08.800 --> 2:22:11.440\n We didn't know about the one for maximum entanglement speed,\n\n2:22:11.440 --> 2:22:14.040\n which is actually something that is possibly measurable,\n\n2:22:14.040 --> 2:22:17.000\n particularly in black hole systems and things like this.\n\n2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:19.600\n Anyway, this is long, long story short.\n\n2:22:19.600 --> 2:22:23.120\n You're asking what the processing specs of the universe,\n\n2:22:23.120 --> 2:22:25.120\n of the sort of computation of the universe.\n\n2:22:25.120 --> 2:22:27.400\n There's a question of even what are the units\n\n2:22:27.400 --> 2:22:29.000\n of some of these measurements, okay?\n\n2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:31.960\n So the units I'm using are Wolfram language instructions\n\n2:22:31.960 --> 2:22:33.280\n per second, okay?\n\n2:22:33.280 --> 2:22:34.840\n Because you gotta have some,\n\n2:22:34.840 --> 2:22:37.000\n what computation are you doing?\n\n2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:38.360\n There gotta be some kind of frame of reference.\n\n2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:39.200\n Right, right.\n\n2:22:39.200 --> 2:22:41.800\n So, because it turns out in the end,\n\n2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:44.240\n there will be, there's sort of an arbitrariness\n\n2:22:44.240 --> 2:22:46.960\n in the language that you use to describe the universe.\n\n2:22:46.960 --> 2:22:51.600\n So in those terms, I think it's like 10 to the 500,\n\n2:22:51.600 --> 2:22:54.320\n Wolfram language operations per second, I think,\n\n2:22:54.320 --> 2:22:56.480\n is the, I think it's of that order.\n\n2:22:56.480 --> 2:22:57.320\n You know, basically.\n\n2:22:57.320 --> 2:22:58.760\n So that's the scale of the computation.\n\n2:22:58.760 --> 2:22:59.920\n What about memory?\n\n2:22:59.920 --> 2:23:01.360\n If there's an interesting thing to say\n\n2:23:01.360 --> 2:23:02.720\n about storage and memory.\n\n2:23:02.720 --> 2:23:04.360\n Well, there's a question of how many sort of atoms\n\n2:23:04.360 --> 2:23:06.280\n of space might there be?\n\n2:23:06.280 --> 2:23:08.680\n You know, maybe 10 to the 400.\n\n2:23:08.680 --> 2:23:11.320\n We don't know exactly how to estimate these numbers.\n\n2:23:11.320 --> 2:23:14.680\n I mean, this is based on some, I would say,\n\n2:23:14.680 --> 2:23:17.960\n somewhat rickety way of estimating things.\n\n2:23:17.960 --> 2:23:20.240\n You know, when there start to be able to be experiments done,\n\n2:23:20.240 --> 2:23:21.840\n if we're lucky, there will be experiments\n\n2:23:21.840 --> 2:23:24.160\n that can actually nail down some of these numbers.\n\n2:23:24.160 --> 2:23:27.920\n And because of computation reducibility,\n\n2:23:27.920 --> 2:23:31.520\n there's not much hope for very efficient compression,\n\n2:23:31.520 --> 2:23:34.080\n like very efficient representation\n\n2:23:34.080 --> 2:23:35.680\n of this atom space? Good question.\n\n2:23:35.680 --> 2:23:37.960\n I mean, there's probably certain things, you know,\n\n2:23:37.960 --> 2:23:40.560\n the fact that we can deduce anything,\n\n2:23:40.560 --> 2:23:44.560\n okay, the question is how deep does the reducibility go?\n\n2:23:44.560 --> 2:23:45.400\n Right. Okay.\n\n2:23:45.400 --> 2:23:46.600\n And I keep on being surprised\n\n2:23:46.600 --> 2:23:48.560\n that it's a lot deeper than I thought.\n\n2:23:48.560 --> 2:23:52.120\n Okay, and so one of the things is that,\n\n2:23:52.120 --> 2:23:53.840\n that there's a question of sort of how much\n\n2:23:53.840 --> 2:23:57.480\n of the whole of physics do we have to be able to get\n\n2:23:57.480 --> 2:23:59.280\n in order to explain certain kinds of phenomena?\n\n2:23:59.280 --> 2:24:02.840\n Like for example, if we want to study quantum interference,\n\n2:24:02.840 --> 2:24:05.800\n do we have to know what an electron is?\n\n2:24:05.800 --> 2:24:08.480\n Turns out I thought we did, turns out we don't.\n\n2:24:08.480 --> 2:24:10.400\n I thought to know what energy is,\n\n2:24:10.400 --> 2:24:12.320\n we would have to know what electrons were.\n\n2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:13.160\n We don't.\n\n2:24:13.160 --> 2:24:15.560\n So you get a lot of really powerful shortcuts.\n\n2:24:15.560 --> 2:24:16.400\n Right.\n\n2:24:16.400 --> 2:24:19.240\n There's a bunch of sort of bulk information about the world.\n\n2:24:19.240 --> 2:24:22.960\n The thing that I'm excited about last few days, okay,\n\n2:24:22.960 --> 2:24:27.560\n is the idea of fermions versus bosons, fundamental idea\n\n2:24:27.560 --> 2:24:29.800\n that I mean, it's the reason we have matter\n\n2:24:29.800 --> 2:24:31.920\n that doesn't just self destruct,\n\n2:24:31.920 --> 2:24:33.800\n is because of the exclusion principle\n\n2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:36.360\n that means that two electrons can never be\n\n2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:38.280\n in the same quantum state.\n\n2:24:38.280 --> 2:24:41.000\n Is it useful for us to maybe first talk\n\n2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:44.240\n about how quantum mechanics fits\n\n2:24:44.240 --> 2:24:46.480\n into the Wolfram physics model?\n\n2:24:46.480 --> 2:24:47.320\n Yes.\n\n2:24:47.320 --> 2:24:48.160\n Let's go there.\n\n2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:49.680\n So we talked about general relativity.\n\n2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:54.680\n Now, what have you found from quantum mechanics\n\n2:24:56.960 --> 2:24:59.920\n within and outside of the Wolfram physics?\n\n2:24:59.920 --> 2:25:04.200\n Right, so I mean, the key idea of quantum mechanics\n\n2:25:04.200 --> 2:25:06.600\n that sort of the typical interpretation\n\n2:25:06.600 --> 2:25:09.960\n is classical physics says a definite thing happens.\n\n2:25:09.960 --> 2:25:12.880\n Quantum physics says there's this whole set of paths\n\n2:25:12.880 --> 2:25:14.600\n of things that might happen.\n\n2:25:14.600 --> 2:25:17.760\n And we are just observing some overall probability\n\n2:25:17.760 --> 2:25:19.680\n of how those paths work.\n\n2:25:19.680 --> 2:25:22.480\n Okay, so when you think about our hypergraphs\n\n2:25:22.480 --> 2:25:24.680\n and all these little updates that are going on,\n\n2:25:24.680 --> 2:25:27.040\n there's a very remarkable thing to realize,\n\n2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:29.240\n which is if you say, well,\n\n2:25:29.240 --> 2:25:32.360\n which particular sequence of updates should you do?\n\n2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:33.760\n Say, well, it's not really defined.\n\n2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:35.400\n You can do any of a whole collection\n\n2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:37.440\n of possible sequences of updates.\n\n2:25:37.440 --> 2:25:42.000\n Okay, that set of possible sequences of updates\n\n2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:44.240\n defines yet another kind of graph\n\n2:25:44.240 --> 2:25:46.120\n that we call a multiway graph.\n\n2:25:46.120 --> 2:25:48.680\n And a multiway graph just is a graph\n\n2:25:48.680 --> 2:25:52.800\n where at every node, there is a choice\n\n2:25:52.800 --> 2:25:55.320\n of several different possible things that could happen.\n\n2:25:55.320 --> 2:25:57.720\n So for example, you go this way, you go that way.\n\n2:25:57.720 --> 2:26:00.920\n Those are two different edges in the multiway graph.\n\n2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:02.640\n And you're building up the set of possibilities.\n\n2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:04.880\n So actually, like, for example, I just made the one,\n\n2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:07.400\n the multiway graph for tic tac toe, okay?\n\n2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:11.000\n So tic tac toe, you start off with some board\n\n2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:12.280\n that, you know, is everything is blank,\n\n2:26:12.280 --> 2:26:15.240\n and then somebody can put down an X somewhere,\n\n2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:18.200\n an O somewhere, and then there are different possibilities.\n\n2:26:18.200 --> 2:26:20.320\n At each stage, there are different possibilities.\n\n2:26:20.320 --> 2:26:22.760\n And so you build up this multiway graph\n\n2:26:22.760 --> 2:26:23.760\n of all those possibilities.\n\n2:26:23.760 --> 2:26:25.960\n Now notice that even in tic tac toe,\n\n2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:28.160\n you have the feature that there can be something\n\n2:26:28.160 --> 2:26:31.000\n where you have two different things that happen\n\n2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:33.400\n and then those branches merge\n\n2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:35.280\n because you end up with the same shape,\n\n2:26:35.280 --> 2:26:37.440\n you know, the same configuration of the board,\n\n2:26:37.440 --> 2:26:40.000\n even though you got there in two different ways.\n\n2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.840\n So the thing that's sort of an inevitable feature\n\n2:26:42.840 --> 2:26:47.360\n of our models is that just like quantum mechanics suggests,\n\n2:26:47.360 --> 2:26:48.880\n definite things don't happen.\n\n2:26:48.880 --> 2:26:50.880\n Instead, you get this whole multiway graph\n\n2:26:50.880 --> 2:26:52.760\n of all these possibilities.\n\n2:26:52.760 --> 2:26:55.680\n Okay, so then the question is, so, okay,\n\n2:26:55.680 --> 2:26:58.320\n so that's sort of a picture of what's going on.\n\n2:26:58.320 --> 2:27:00.520\n Now you say, okay, well, quantum mechanics\n\n2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:02.720\n has all these features of, you know,\n\n2:27:02.720 --> 2:27:04.880\n all this mathematical structure and so on.\n\n2:27:04.880 --> 2:27:07.160\n How do you get that mathematical structure?\n\n2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:08.880\n Okay, a couple of things to say.\n\n2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:11.680\n So quantum mechanics is actually, in a sense,\n\n2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:13.960\n two different theories glued together.\n\n2:27:13.960 --> 2:27:15.680\n Quantum mechanics is the theory\n\n2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:18.120\n of how quantum amplitudes work\n\n2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:19.440\n that more or less give you the probabilities\n\n2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:20.720\n of things happening.\n\n2:27:20.720 --> 2:27:22.800\n And it's the theory of quantum measurement,\n\n2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:25.200\n which is the theory of how we actually\n\n2:27:25.200 --> 2:27:27.000\n conclude definite things.\n\n2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:29.080\n Because the mathematics just gives you\n\n2:27:29.080 --> 2:27:30.760\n these quantum amplitudes, which are more or less\n\n2:27:30.760 --> 2:27:32.480\n probabilities of things happening,\n\n2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:35.880\n but yet we actually observe definite things in the world.\n\n2:27:36.920 --> 2:27:39.120\n Quantum measurement has always been a bit mysterious.\n\n2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:41.160\n It's always been something where people just say,\n\n2:27:41.160 --> 2:27:42.400\n well, the mathematics says this,\n\n2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:43.480\n but then you do a measurement,\n\n2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:45.120\n and there are philosophical arguments\n\n2:27:45.120 --> 2:27:46.600\n about what the measurement is.\n\n2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:48.800\n But it's not something where there's a theory\n\n2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:49.720\n of the measurement.\n\n2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:52.120\n Somebody on Reddit also asked,\n\n2:27:53.080 --> 2:27:56.800\n please ask Stephen to tell his story\n\n2:27:56.800 --> 2:27:59.840\n of the double slit experiment.\n\n2:27:59.840 --> 2:28:01.160\n Okay, yeah, I can.\n\n2:28:01.160 --> 2:28:02.880\n Is that, does that make sense?\n\n2:28:02.880 --> 2:28:03.960\n Oh yeah, it makes sense.\n\n2:28:03.960 --> 2:28:05.000\n Absolutely makes sense.\n\n2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:07.760\n Why, is this like a good way to discuss?\n\n2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:08.600\n A little bit.\n\n2:28:08.600 --> 2:28:10.560\n Let me go, let me explain a couple of things first.\n\n2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:13.840\n So the structure of quantum mechanics\n\n2:28:13.840 --> 2:28:16.240\n is mathematically quite complicated.\n\n2:28:16.240 --> 2:28:18.600\n One of the features, let's see,\n\n2:28:18.600 --> 2:28:20.520\n well, how to describe this.\n\n2:28:20.520 --> 2:28:23.800\n Okay, so first point is there's this multiway graph\n\n2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:26.880\n of all these different paths of things\n\n2:28:26.880 --> 2:28:28.760\n that can happen in the world.\n\n2:28:28.760 --> 2:28:32.600\n And the important point is that these,\n\n2:28:32.600 --> 2:28:35.600\n you can have branchings and you can have mergings.\n\n2:28:35.600 --> 2:28:39.680\n Okay, so this property turns out causal invariance\n\n2:28:39.680 --> 2:28:43.360\n is the statement that the number of mergings\n\n2:28:43.360 --> 2:28:45.520\n is equal to the number of branchings.\n\n2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:46.360\n Yeah.\n\n2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:48.720\n So in other words, every time there's a branch,\n\n2:28:48.720 --> 2:28:50.640\n eventually there will also be a merge.\n\n2:28:50.640 --> 2:28:52.600\n In other words, every time there were two possibilities\n\n2:28:52.600 --> 2:28:55.120\n for what might've happened, eventually those will merge.\n\n2:28:55.120 --> 2:28:57.400\n Beautiful concept by the way, but yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:28:57.400 --> 2:29:02.400\n So that idea, okay, so then, so that's one thing\n\n2:29:03.920 --> 2:29:07.680\n and that's closely related to the sort of objectivity\n\n2:29:07.680 --> 2:29:08.520\n in quantum mechanics.\n\n2:29:08.520 --> 2:29:10.720\n The fact that we believe definite things happen,\n\n2:29:10.720 --> 2:29:13.200\n it's because although there are all these different paths,\n\n2:29:13.200 --> 2:29:15.600\n in some sense, because of causal invariance,\n\n2:29:15.600 --> 2:29:17.640\n they all imply the same thing.\n\n2:29:17.640 --> 2:29:19.400\n I'm cheating a little bit in saying that,\n\n2:29:19.400 --> 2:29:22.120\n but that's roughly the essence of what's going on.\n\n2:29:22.120 --> 2:29:24.560\n Okay, next thing to think about\n\n2:29:24.560 --> 2:29:27.440\n is you have this multiway graph,\n\n2:29:27.440 --> 2:29:28.840\n it has all these different possible things\n\n2:29:28.840 --> 2:29:30.040\n that are happening.\n\n2:29:30.040 --> 2:29:32.440\n Now we ask, this multiway graph\n\n2:29:32.440 --> 2:29:34.120\n is sort of evolving with time.\n\n2:29:34.120 --> 2:29:36.680\n Over time, it's branching, it's merging,\n\n2:29:36.680 --> 2:29:38.400\n it's doing all these things, okay?\n\n2:29:39.840 --> 2:29:44.680\n Question we can ask is if we slice it at a particular time,\n\n2:29:44.680 --> 2:29:46.120\n what do we see?\n\n2:29:46.120 --> 2:29:48.840\n And that slice represents in a sense,\n\n2:29:48.840 --> 2:29:51.240\n something to do with the state of the universe\n\n2:29:51.240 --> 2:29:53.080\n at a particular time.\n\n2:29:53.080 --> 2:29:55.080\n So in other words, we've got this multiway graph\n\n2:29:55.080 --> 2:29:56.680\n of all these possibilities,\n\n2:29:56.680 --> 2:30:01.320\n and then we're asking, okay, we take the slice,\n\n2:30:01.320 --> 2:30:04.440\n this slice represents, okay,\n\n2:30:04.440 --> 2:30:05.640\n each of these different paths\n\n2:30:05.640 --> 2:30:07.760\n corresponds to a different quantum possibility\n\n2:30:07.760 --> 2:30:09.320\n for what's happening.\n\n2:30:09.320 --> 2:30:11.440\n When we take the slice, we're saying,\n\n2:30:11.440 --> 2:30:13.120\n what are the set of quantum possibilities\n\n2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:14.960\n that exist at a particular time?\n\n2:30:14.960 --> 2:30:17.640\n And when you say slice, you slice the graph\n\n2:30:17.640 --> 2:30:19.720\n and then there's a bunch of leaves.\n\n2:30:19.720 --> 2:30:20.560\n A bunch of leaves.\n\n2:30:20.560 --> 2:30:23.440\n Those represent the state of things.\n\n2:30:23.440 --> 2:30:26.240\n Right, but then, okay, so the important thing\n\n2:30:26.240 --> 2:30:29.040\n that you are quickly picking up on\n\n2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:31.960\n is that what matters is kind of\n\n2:30:31.960 --> 2:30:34.600\n how these leaves are related to each other.\n\n2:30:34.600 --> 2:30:37.560\n So a good way to tell how leaves are related\n\n2:30:37.560 --> 2:30:39.920\n is just to say on the step before\n\n2:30:39.920 --> 2:30:42.160\n do they have a common ancestor?\n\n2:30:42.160 --> 2:30:43.960\n So two leaves might be,\n\n2:30:43.960 --> 2:30:45.800\n they might have just branched from one thing\n\n2:30:45.800 --> 2:30:47.920\n or they might be far away,\n\n2:30:47.920 --> 2:30:50.720\n way far apart in this graph\n\n2:30:50.720 --> 2:30:52.320\n where to get to a common ancestor,\n\n2:30:52.320 --> 2:30:53.400\n maybe you have to go all the way back\n\n2:30:53.400 --> 2:30:54.240\n to the beginning of the graph,\n\n2:30:54.240 --> 2:30:55.080\n all the way back to the beginning.\n\n2:30:55.080 --> 2:30:57.160\n So there's some kind of measure of distance.\n\n2:30:57.160 --> 2:31:02.000\n Right, but what you get is by making the slice,\n\n2:31:02.000 --> 2:31:05.880\n we call it branchial space, the space of branches.\n\n2:31:05.880 --> 2:31:08.360\n And in this branchial space,\n\n2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:11.240\n you have a graph that represents the relationships\n\n2:31:11.240 --> 2:31:14.640\n between these quantum states in branchial space.\n\n2:31:14.640 --> 2:31:18.000\n You have this notion of distance in branchial space.\n\n2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:18.840\n Okay, so.\n\n2:31:18.840 --> 2:31:20.880\n It's connected to quantum entanglement.\n\n2:31:20.880 --> 2:31:23.520\n Yes, yes, it's basically,\n\n2:31:23.520 --> 2:31:25.640\n the distance in branchial space\n\n2:31:25.640 --> 2:31:27.840\n is kind of an entanglement distance.\n\n2:31:27.840 --> 2:31:28.680\n So this.\n\n2:31:28.680 --> 2:31:29.880\n That's a very nice model.\n\n2:31:29.880 --> 2:31:33.240\n Right, it is very nice, it's very beautiful.\n\n2:31:33.240 --> 2:31:35.520\n I mean, it's so clean.\n\n2:31:35.520 --> 2:31:38.920\n I mean, it's really, and it tells one,\n\n2:31:38.920 --> 2:31:42.840\n okay, so anyway, so then this branchial space\n\n2:31:42.840 --> 2:31:46.080\n has this sort of map of the entanglements\n\n2:31:46.080 --> 2:31:47.760\n between quantum states.\n\n2:31:47.760 --> 2:31:50.360\n So in physical space, we have,\n\n2:31:50.360 --> 2:31:54.680\n so you can say, take, let's say the causal graph,\n\n2:31:54.680 --> 2:31:57.800\n and we can slice that at a particular time,\n\n2:31:57.800 --> 2:31:58.840\n and then we get this map\n\n2:31:58.840 --> 2:32:01.400\n of how things are laid out in physical space.\n\n2:32:01.400 --> 2:32:02.720\n When we do the same kind of thing,\n\n2:32:02.720 --> 2:32:04.840\n there's a thing called the multiway causal graph,\n\n2:32:04.840 --> 2:32:06.360\n which is the analog of a causal graph\n\n2:32:06.360 --> 2:32:07.760\n for the multiway system.\n\n2:32:07.760 --> 2:32:11.360\n We slice that, we get essentially the relationships\n\n2:32:11.360 --> 2:32:13.720\n between things, not in physical space,\n\n2:32:13.720 --> 2:32:15.720\n but in the space of quantum states.\n\n2:32:15.720 --> 2:32:17.040\n It's like which quantum state\n\n2:32:17.040 --> 2:32:19.360\n is similar to which other quantum state.\n\n2:32:19.360 --> 2:32:22.280\n Okay, so now I think next thing to say\n\n2:32:22.280 --> 2:32:24.800\n is just to mention how quantum measurement works.\n\n2:32:24.800 --> 2:32:27.560\n So quantum measurement has to do with reference frames\n\n2:32:27.560 --> 2:32:29.760\n in branchial space.\n\n2:32:29.760 --> 2:32:33.720\n So, okay, so measurement in physical space,\n\n2:32:33.720 --> 2:32:38.720\n it matters whether how we assign spatial position\n\n2:32:38.720 --> 2:32:42.520\n and how we define coordinates in space and time.\n\n2:32:42.520 --> 2:32:45.360\n And that's how we make measurements in ordinary space.\n\n2:32:45.360 --> 2:32:48.240\n Are we making a measurement based on us sitting still here?\n\n2:32:48.240 --> 2:32:49.880\n Are we traveling at half the speed of light\n\n2:32:49.880 --> 2:32:51.600\n and making measurements that way?\n\n2:32:51.600 --> 2:32:53.080\n These are different reference frames\n\n2:32:53.080 --> 2:32:54.760\n in which we're making our measurements.\n\n2:32:54.760 --> 2:32:57.840\n And the relationship between different events\n\n2:32:57.840 --> 2:32:59.720\n and different points in space and time\n\n2:33:00.760 --> 2:33:04.200\n will be different depending on what reference frame we're in.\n\n2:33:04.200 --> 2:33:06.480\n Okay, so then we have this idea\n\n2:33:06.480 --> 2:33:08.880\n of quantum observation frames,\n\n2:33:08.880 --> 2:33:11.040\n which are the analog of reference frames,\n\n2:33:11.040 --> 2:33:13.040\n but in branchial space.\n\n2:33:13.040 --> 2:33:15.880\n And so what happens is what we realize\n\n2:33:15.880 --> 2:33:19.960\n is that a quantum measurement is the observer\n\n2:33:19.960 --> 2:33:23.000\n is sort of arbitrarily determining this reference frame.\n\n2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:26.840\n The observer is saying, I'm going to understand the world\n\n2:33:26.840 --> 2:33:30.560\n by saying that space and time are coordinated this way.\n\n2:33:30.560 --> 2:33:32.600\n I'm gonna understand the world by saying\n\n2:33:32.600 --> 2:33:36.520\n that quantum states and time are coordinated in this way.\n\n2:33:36.520 --> 2:33:38.280\n And essentially what happens is\n\n2:33:38.280 --> 2:33:40.920\n that the process of quantum measurement\n\n2:33:40.920 --> 2:33:44.920\n is a process of deciding how you slice up\n\n2:33:44.920 --> 2:33:48.560\n this multiway system in these quantum observation frames.\n\n2:33:48.560 --> 2:33:51.760\n So in a sense, the observer, the way the observer enters\n\n2:33:51.760 --> 2:33:55.600\n is by their choice of these quantum observation frames.\n\n2:33:55.600 --> 2:33:58.880\n And what happens is that the observer,\n\n2:33:58.880 --> 2:34:00.480\n because, okay, this is again,\n\n2:34:00.480 --> 2:34:03.120\n another stack of other concepts, but anyway,\n\n2:34:03.120 --> 2:34:06.200\n because the observer is computationally bounded,\n\n2:34:06.200 --> 2:34:08.880\n there is a limit to the type of quantum observation frames\n\n2:34:08.880 --> 2:34:09.960\n that they can construct.\n\n2:34:09.960 --> 2:34:12.600\n Interesting, okay, so there's some constraints,\n\n2:34:12.600 --> 2:34:17.600\n some limit on the choice of observation frames.\n\n2:34:17.760 --> 2:34:19.960\n Right, and by the way, I just want to mention\n\n2:34:19.960 --> 2:34:21.840\n that there's a, I mean, it's bizarre,\n\n2:34:21.840 --> 2:34:23.640\n but there's a hierarchy of these things.\n\n2:34:23.640 --> 2:34:27.440\n So in thermodynamics,\n\n2:34:27.440 --> 2:34:29.600\n the fact that we believe entropy increases,\n\n2:34:29.600 --> 2:34:31.480\n we believe things get more disordered,\n\n2:34:31.480 --> 2:34:32.520\n is a consequence of the fact\n\n2:34:32.520 --> 2:34:34.280\n that we can't track each individual molecule.\n\n2:34:34.280 --> 2:34:36.160\n If we could track every single molecule,\n\n2:34:36.160 --> 2:34:38.240\n we could run every movie in reverse, so to speak,\n\n2:34:38.240 --> 2:34:42.200\n and we would not see that things are getting more disordered.\n\n2:34:42.200 --> 2:34:44.800\n But it's because we are computationally bounded,\n\n2:34:44.800 --> 2:34:46.720\n we can only look at these big blobs\n\n2:34:46.720 --> 2:34:49.560\n of what all these molecules collectively do,\n\n2:34:49.560 --> 2:34:52.280\n that we think that things are,\n\n2:34:52.280 --> 2:34:54.920\n that we describe it in terms of entropy increasing\n\n2:34:54.920 --> 2:34:55.800\n and so on.\n\n2:34:55.800 --> 2:34:58.560\n And it's the same phenomenon, basically,\n\n2:34:58.560 --> 2:35:01.520\n and also a consequence of computational irreducibility\n\n2:35:01.520 --> 2:35:04.800\n that causes us to basically be forced to conclude\n\n2:35:04.800 --> 2:35:06.920\n that definite things happen in the world,\n\n2:35:06.920 --> 2:35:08.720\n even though there's this quantum,\n\n2:35:08.720 --> 2:35:10.680\n this set of all these different quantum processes\n\n2:35:10.680 --> 2:35:11.880\n that are going on.\n\n2:35:11.880 --> 2:35:15.400\n So, I mean, I'm skipping a little bit,\n\n2:35:15.400 --> 2:35:18.560\n but that's a rough picture.\n\n2:35:18.560 --> 2:35:21.880\n And in the evolution of the Wolfram Physics Project,\n\n2:35:21.880 --> 2:35:24.280\n where do you feel we stand on some of the puzzles\n\n2:35:24.280 --> 2:35:25.120\n that are along the way?\n\n2:35:25.120 --> 2:35:28.080\n See, you're skipping along a bunch of stuff.\n\n2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:30.440\n It's amazing how much these things are unraveling.\n\n2:35:30.440 --> 2:35:32.480\n I mean, you know, these things, look,\n\n2:35:32.480 --> 2:35:35.640\n it used to be the case that I would agree with Dick Feynman,\n\n2:35:35.640 --> 2:35:38.840\n nobody understands quantum mechanics, including me, okay?\n\n2:35:38.840 --> 2:35:40.120\n I'm getting to the point where I think\n\n2:35:40.120 --> 2:35:41.560\n I actually understand quantum mechanics.\n\n2:35:41.560 --> 2:35:45.720\n My exercise, okay, is can I explain quantum mechanics\n\n2:35:45.720 --> 2:35:48.800\n for real at the level of kind of middle school\n\n2:35:48.800 --> 2:35:50.320\n type explanation?\n\n2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:52.600\n And I'm getting closer, it's getting there.\n\n2:35:52.600 --> 2:35:54.960\n I'm not quite there, I've tried it a few times,\n\n2:35:54.960 --> 2:35:57.640\n and I realized that there are things\n\n2:35:57.640 --> 2:35:59.080\n where I have to start talking about\n\n2:35:59.080 --> 2:36:00.920\n elaborate mathematical concepts and so on.\n\n2:36:00.920 --> 2:36:03.000\n But I think, and you've got to realize\n\n2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:06.280\n that it's not self evident that we can explain\n\n2:36:06.280 --> 2:36:09.240\n at an intuitively graspable level,\n\n2:36:09.240 --> 2:36:12.400\n something which, about the way the universe works,\n\n2:36:12.400 --> 2:36:14.760\n the universe wasn't built for our understanding,\n\n2:36:14.760 --> 2:36:16.280\n so to speak.\n\n2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:21.280\n But I think then, okay, so another important idea\n\n2:36:21.720 --> 2:36:25.280\n is this idea of branchial space, which I mentioned,\n\n2:36:25.280 --> 2:36:27.400\n this sort of space of quantum states.\n\n2:36:27.400 --> 2:36:31.240\n It is, okay, so I mentioned Einstein's equations\n\n2:36:31.240 --> 2:36:36.240\n describing the effect of mass and energy\n\n2:36:37.400 --> 2:36:40.840\n on trajectories of particles, on GD6.\n\n2:36:40.840 --> 2:36:44.920\n The curvature of physical space is associated\n\n2:36:44.920 --> 2:36:47.040\n with the presence of energy,\n\n2:36:47.040 --> 2:36:49.400\n according to Einstein's equations, okay?\n\n2:36:49.400 --> 2:36:51.920\n So it turns out that, rather amazingly,\n\n2:36:51.920 --> 2:36:54.880\n the same thing is true in branchial space.\n\n2:36:54.880 --> 2:36:57.360\n So it turns out the presence of energy\n\n2:36:57.360 --> 2:36:59.440\n or more accurately Lagrangian density,\n\n2:36:59.440 --> 2:37:03.200\n which is a kind of relativistic invariant version of energy,\n\n2:37:03.200 --> 2:37:08.200\n the presence of that causes essentially deflection of GD6\n\n2:37:08.560 --> 2:37:11.160\n in this branchial space, okay?\n\n2:37:11.160 --> 2:37:12.560\n So you might say, so what?\n\n2:37:12.560 --> 2:37:17.040\n Well, it turns out that the sort of the best formulation\n\n2:37:17.040 --> 2:37:18.800\n we have of quantum mechanics,\n\n2:37:18.800 --> 2:37:21.360\n this Feynman path integral,\n\n2:37:21.360 --> 2:37:26.200\n is a thing that describes quantum processes\n\n2:37:26.200 --> 2:37:31.200\n in terms of mathematics that can be interpreted as,\n\n2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:33.880\n well, in quantum mechanics, the big thing\n\n2:37:33.880 --> 2:37:35.360\n is you get these quantum amplitudes,\n\n2:37:35.360 --> 2:37:38.280\n which are complex numbers that represent,\n\n2:37:38.280 --> 2:37:39.400\n when you combine them together,\n\n2:37:39.400 --> 2:37:41.560\n represent probabilities of things happening.\n\n2:37:41.560 --> 2:37:42.840\n And so the big story has been,\n\n2:37:42.840 --> 2:37:45.320\n how do you derive these quantum amplitudes?\n\n2:37:45.320 --> 2:37:47.480\n And people think these quantum amplitudes,\n\n2:37:47.480 --> 2:37:49.160\n they have a complex number,\n\n2:37:49.160 --> 2:37:51.200\n has a real part and an imaginary part.\n\n2:37:51.200 --> 2:37:53.920\n You can also think of it as a magnitude and a phase.\n\n2:37:53.920 --> 2:37:57.160\n And people have sort of thought these quantum amplitudes\n\n2:37:57.160 --> 2:38:00.040\n have magnitude and phase, and you compute those together.\n\n2:38:00.040 --> 2:38:03.680\n Turns out that the magnitude and the phase\n\n2:38:03.680 --> 2:38:06.120\n come from completely different places.\n\n2:38:06.120 --> 2:38:10.080\n The magnitude comes, okay, so how do you compute things\n\n2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:10.920\n in quantum mechanics?\n\n2:38:10.920 --> 2:38:13.360\n Roughly, I'm telling you, I'm getting there\n\n2:38:13.360 --> 2:38:15.080\n to be able to do this at a middle school level,\n\n2:38:15.080 --> 2:38:16.160\n but I'm not there yet.\n\n2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:20.440\n Roughly what happens is you're asking,\n\n2:38:20.440 --> 2:38:24.160\n does this state in quantum mechanics\n\n2:38:24.160 --> 2:38:27.080\n evolve to this other state in quantum mechanics?\n\n2:38:27.080 --> 2:38:30.600\n And you can think about that like a particle traveling\n\n2:38:30.600 --> 2:38:33.240\n or something traveling through physical space,\n\n2:38:33.240 --> 2:38:36.160\n but instead it's traveling through branchial space.\n\n2:38:36.160 --> 2:38:38.920\n And so what's happening is, does this quantum state evolve\n\n2:38:38.920 --> 2:38:39.920\n to this other quantum state?\n\n2:38:39.920 --> 2:38:42.160\n It's like saying, does this object move\n\n2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:45.160\n from this place in space to this other place in space?\n\n2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:49.360\n Okay, now the way that these quantum amplitudes\n\n2:38:49.360 --> 2:38:54.000\n characterize kind of to what extent the thing\n\n2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:56.400\n will successfully reach some particular point\n\n2:38:56.400 --> 2:38:58.560\n in branchial space, just like in physical space,\n\n2:38:58.560 --> 2:39:00.720\n you could say, oh, it had a certain velocity\n\n2:39:00.720 --> 2:39:02.400\n and it went in this direction.\n\n2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:05.160\n In branchial space, there's a similar kind of concept.\n\n2:39:05.160 --> 2:39:08.280\n Is there a nice way to visualize for me now\n\n2:39:08.280 --> 2:39:10.560\n mentally branchial space?\n\n2:39:10.560 --> 2:39:13.720\n It's just, you have this hypergraph,\n\n2:39:13.720 --> 2:39:15.720\n sorry, you have this multiway graph.\n\n2:39:15.720 --> 2:39:18.440\n It's this big branching thing, branching and merging thing.\n\n2:39:18.440 --> 2:39:21.800\n But I mean, like moving through that space,\n\n2:39:21.800 --> 2:39:24.360\n I'm just trying to understand what that looks like.\n\n2:39:25.920 --> 2:39:29.280\n You know, that space is probably exponential dimensional,\n\n2:39:29.280 --> 2:39:32.280\n which makes it again, another can of worms\n\n2:39:32.280 --> 2:39:33.880\n in understanding what's going on.\n\n2:39:33.880 --> 2:39:36.920\n That space as in an ordinary space,\n\n2:39:36.920 --> 2:39:39.160\n this hypergraph, the spatial hypergraph\n\n2:39:39.160 --> 2:39:42.600\n limits to something which is like a manifold,\n\n2:39:42.600 --> 2:39:45.040\n like something like three dimensional space.\n\n2:39:45.040 --> 2:39:48.720\n Almost certainly the multiway graph limits\n\n2:39:48.720 --> 2:39:52.360\n to a Hilbert space, which is something that,\n\n2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:55.560\n I mean, it's just a weird exponential dimensional space.\n\n2:39:55.560 --> 2:39:57.400\n And by the way, you can ask, I mean,\n\n2:39:57.400 --> 2:39:58.880\n there are much weirder things that go on.\n\n2:39:58.880 --> 2:40:00.720\n For example, one of the things I've been interested in\n\n2:40:00.720 --> 2:40:03.920\n is the expansion of the universe in branchial space.\n\n2:40:03.920 --> 2:40:07.080\n So we know the universe is expanding in physical space,\n\n2:40:07.080 --> 2:40:09.200\n but the universe is probably also expanding\n\n2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:10.920\n in branchial space.\n\n2:40:10.920 --> 2:40:13.280\n So that means the number of quantum states\n\n2:40:13.280 --> 2:40:15.760\n of the universe is increasing with time.\n\n2:40:15.760 --> 2:40:17.880\n The diameter of the thing is growing.\n\n2:40:17.880 --> 2:40:19.480\n Right, so that means that the,\n\n2:40:19.480 --> 2:40:22.760\n and by the way, this is related\n\n2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:25.080\n to whether quantum computing can ever work.\n\n2:40:28.200 --> 2:40:29.040\n Why?\n\n2:40:29.040 --> 2:40:30.440\n Okay, so let me explain why.\n\n2:40:30.440 --> 2:40:32.840\n So let's talk about, okay, so first of all,\n\n2:40:32.840 --> 2:40:35.320\n just to finish the thought about quantum amplitudes,\n\n2:40:35.320 --> 2:40:37.320\n that the incredibly beautiful thing,\n\n2:40:37.320 --> 2:40:40.680\n but I'm just very excited about this.\n\n2:40:40.680 --> 2:40:44.640\n The fine path integral is this formula.\n\n2:40:44.640 --> 2:40:47.360\n It says that the amplitude, the quantum amplitude\n\n2:40:47.360 --> 2:40:49.480\n is E to the I S over H bar,\n\n2:40:49.480 --> 2:40:51.560\n where S is the thing called the action.\n\n2:40:51.560 --> 2:40:55.720\n And it, okay, so that can be thought of\n\n2:40:55.720 --> 2:40:59.280\n as representing a deflection of the angle\n\n2:40:59.280 --> 2:41:02.200\n of this path in the multiway graph.\n\n2:41:02.200 --> 2:41:05.040\n So it's a deflection of a geodesic in the multiway path\n\n2:41:05.040 --> 2:41:06.960\n that is caused by this thing called the action,\n\n2:41:06.960 --> 2:41:10.040\n which is essentially associated with energy, okay?\n\n2:41:10.040 --> 2:41:13.760\n And so this is a deflection of a path in branchial space\n\n2:41:13.760 --> 2:41:15.520\n that is described by this path integral,\n\n2:41:15.520 --> 2:41:17.760\n which is the thing that is the mathematical essence\n\n2:41:17.760 --> 2:41:19.440\n of quantum mechanics.\n\n2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:22.760\n Turns out that deflection is,\n\n2:41:22.760 --> 2:41:25.240\n the deflection of geodesics in branchial space\n\n2:41:25.240 --> 2:41:28.720\n follows the exact same mathematical setup\n\n2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:31.880\n as the deflection of geodesics in physical space,\n\n2:41:31.880 --> 2:41:34.280\n except the deflection of geodesics in physical space\n\n2:41:34.280 --> 2:41:36.480\n is described with Einstein's equations.\n\n2:41:36.480 --> 2:41:38.600\n The deflection of geodesics in branchial space\n\n2:41:38.600 --> 2:41:40.880\n is defined by the Feynman path integral,\n\n2:41:40.880 --> 2:41:42.800\n and they are the same.\n\n2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:45.760\n In other words, they are mathematically the same.\n\n2:41:45.760 --> 2:41:48.360\n So that means that general relativity\n\n2:41:48.360 --> 2:41:53.200\n is a story of essentially motion in physical space.\n\n2:41:53.200 --> 2:41:55.560\n Quantum mechanics is a story of essentially motion\n\n2:41:55.560 --> 2:41:57.320\n in branchial space.\n\n2:41:57.320 --> 2:42:01.360\n And the underlying equation for those two things,\n\n2:42:01.360 --> 2:42:02.560\n although it's presented differently\n\n2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:04.160\n because one's interested in different things\n\n2:42:04.160 --> 2:42:06.080\n in branchial space than physical space,\n\n2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:08.720\n but the underlying equation is the same.\n\n2:42:08.720 --> 2:42:13.440\n So in other words, it's just these two theories,\n\n2:42:13.440 --> 2:42:14.600\n which are those two sort of pillars\n\n2:42:14.600 --> 2:42:16.320\n of 20th century physics,\n\n2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:19.080\n which have seemed to be off in different directions,\n\n2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:21.760\n are actually facets of the exact same theory.\n\n2:42:24.280 --> 2:42:26.960\n That's exciting to see where that evolves\n\n2:42:26.960 --> 2:42:29.120\n and exciting that that just is there.\n\n2:42:29.120 --> 2:42:31.000\n Right, I mean, to me,\n\n2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:34.480\n look, having spent some part of my early life\n\n2:42:34.480 --> 2:42:37.040\n working in the context of these theories\n\n2:42:37.040 --> 2:42:39.400\n of 20th century physics,\n\n2:42:39.400 --> 2:42:41.960\n it's, they just, they seem so different.\n\n2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:44.080\n And the fact that they're really the same\n\n2:42:44.080 --> 2:42:46.480\n is just really amazing.\n\n2:42:46.480 --> 2:42:49.120\n Actually, you mentioned double slit experiment, okay?\n\n2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:50.280\n So the double slit experiment\n\n2:42:50.280 --> 2:42:54.360\n is an interference phenomenon where you say there are,\n\n2:42:54.360 --> 2:42:56.600\n you can have a photon or an electron,\n\n2:42:56.600 --> 2:42:58.240\n and you say there are these two slits\n\n2:42:58.240 --> 2:43:00.320\n that could have gone through either one,\n\n2:43:00.320 --> 2:43:02.560\n but there is this interference pattern\n\n2:43:02.560 --> 2:43:05.080\n where there's destructive interference,\n\n2:43:05.080 --> 2:43:07.200\n where you might've said in classical physics,\n\n2:43:07.200 --> 2:43:09.000\n oh, well, if there are two slits,\n\n2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:10.440\n then there's a better chance\n\n2:43:10.440 --> 2:43:12.120\n that it gets through one or the other of them.\n\n2:43:12.120 --> 2:43:13.240\n But in quantum mechanics,\n\n2:43:13.240 --> 2:43:15.720\n there's this phenomenon of destructive interference\n\n2:43:15.720 --> 2:43:18.120\n that means that even though there are two slits,\n\n2:43:18.120 --> 2:43:20.240\n two can lead to nothing,\n\n2:43:20.240 --> 2:43:22.560\n as opposed to two leading to more\n\n2:43:22.560 --> 2:43:25.240\n than, for example, one slit.\n\n2:43:25.240 --> 2:43:27.480\n And what happens in this model,\n\n2:43:27.480 --> 2:43:29.040\n and we've just been understanding this\n\n2:43:29.040 --> 2:43:30.760\n in the last few weeks, actually,\n\n2:43:30.760 --> 2:43:34.400\n is that what essentially happens\n\n2:43:34.400 --> 2:43:38.040\n is that the double slit experiment\n\n2:43:38.040 --> 2:43:39.360\n is a story of the interface\n\n2:43:39.360 --> 2:43:41.960\n between branchial space and physical space.\n\n2:43:41.960 --> 2:43:43.080\n And what's essentially happening\n\n2:43:43.080 --> 2:43:45.520\n is that the destructive interference\n\n2:43:45.520 --> 2:43:48.520\n is the result of the two possible paths\n\n2:43:48.520 --> 2:43:51.200\n associated with photons going through those two slits\n\n2:43:51.200 --> 2:43:53.960\n winding up at opposite ends of branchial space.\n\n2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:57.120\n And so that's why there's sort of nothing there\n\n2:43:57.120 --> 2:43:58.440\n when you look at it,\n\n2:43:58.440 --> 2:44:02.120\n is because these two different sort of branches\n\n2:44:02.120 --> 2:44:03.920\n couldn't get merged together\n\n2:44:03.920 --> 2:44:06.240\n to produce something that you can measure\n\n2:44:06.240 --> 2:44:07.680\n in physical space.\n\n2:44:07.680 --> 2:44:10.680\n Is there a lot to be understood about branchial space?\n\n2:44:10.680 --> 2:44:13.920\n I guess, mathematically speaking.\n\n2:44:13.920 --> 2:44:16.400\n Yes, it's a very beautiful mathematical thing.\n\n2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:18.280\n And it's very, I mean, by the way,\n\n2:44:18.280 --> 2:44:22.000\n this whole theory is just amazingly rich\n\n2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:24.920\n in terms of the mathematics that it says should exist.\n\n2:44:24.920 --> 2:44:26.120\n Okay, so for example,\n\n2:44:26.120 --> 2:44:30.320\n calculus is a story of infinitesimal change\n\n2:44:30.320 --> 2:44:32.000\n in integer dimensional space,\n\n2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:34.880\n one dimensional, two dimensional, three dimensional space.\n\n2:44:34.880 --> 2:44:37.960\n We need a theory of infinitesimal change\n\n2:44:37.960 --> 2:44:41.440\n in fractional dimensional and dynamic dimensional space.\n\n2:44:41.440 --> 2:44:42.640\n No such theory exists.\n\n2:44:42.640 --> 2:44:45.280\n So there's tools of mathematics that are needed here.\n\n2:44:45.280 --> 2:44:46.120\n Right.\n\n2:44:46.120 --> 2:44:47.040\n And this is a motivation for that actually.\n\n2:44:47.040 --> 2:44:50.320\n Right, and there are indications\n\n2:44:50.320 --> 2:44:51.760\n and we can do computer experiments\n\n2:44:51.760 --> 2:44:53.560\n and we can see how it's gonna come out,\n\n2:44:53.560 --> 2:44:58.040\n but we need to, the actual mathematics doesn't exist.\n\n2:44:58.040 --> 2:45:00.720\n And in branchial space, it's actually even worse.\n\n2:45:00.720 --> 2:45:04.720\n There's even more sort of layers of mathematics that are,\n\n2:45:04.720 --> 2:45:06.240\n we can see how it works roughly\n\n2:45:06.240 --> 2:45:07.960\n by doing computer experiments,\n\n2:45:07.960 --> 2:45:10.120\n but to really understand it,\n\n2:45:10.120 --> 2:45:13.320\n we need more sort of mathematical sophistication.\n\n2:45:13.320 --> 2:45:14.880\n So quantum computers.\n\n2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:17.800\n Okay, so the basic idea of quantum computers,\n\n2:45:17.800 --> 2:45:19.960\n the promise of quantum computers\n\n2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:23.640\n is quantum mechanics does things in parallel.\n\n2:45:23.640 --> 2:45:26.960\n And so you can sort of intrinsically do computations\n\n2:45:26.960 --> 2:45:27.880\n in parallel.\n\n2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:30.160\n And somehow that can be much more efficient\n\n2:45:30.160 --> 2:45:33.280\n than just doing them one after another.\n\n2:45:33.280 --> 2:45:36.240\n And I actually worked on quantum computing a bit\n\n2:45:36.240 --> 2:45:40.680\n with Dick Feynman back in 1981, two, three,\n\n2:45:40.680 --> 2:45:41.800\n that kind of timeframe.\n\n2:45:41.800 --> 2:45:42.640\n And we...\n\n2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:43.680\n It's a fascinating image.\n\n2:45:43.680 --> 2:45:46.600\n You and Feynman working on quantum computers.\n\n2:45:46.600 --> 2:45:47.880\n Well, we tried to work,\n\n2:45:47.880 --> 2:45:51.040\n the big thing we tried to do was invent a randomness chip\n\n2:45:51.040 --> 2:45:53.800\n that would generate randomness at a high speed\n\n2:45:53.800 --> 2:45:55.480\n using quantum mechanics.\n\n2:45:55.480 --> 2:45:58.920\n And the discovery that that wasn't really possible\n\n2:45:58.920 --> 2:46:01.520\n was part of the story of,\n\n2:46:01.520 --> 2:46:03.000\n we never really wrote anything about it.\n\n2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:04.240\n I think maybe he wrote some stuff,\n\n2:46:04.240 --> 2:46:07.520\n but we didn't write stuff about what we figured out\n\n2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:10.080\n about sort of the fact that it really seemed like\n\n2:46:10.080 --> 2:46:12.320\n the measurement process in quantum mechanics\n\n2:46:12.320 --> 2:46:15.680\n was a serious damper on what was possible to do\n\n2:46:15.680 --> 2:46:19.600\n in sort of the possible advantages of quantum mechanics\n\n2:46:19.600 --> 2:46:20.760\n for computing.\n\n2:46:20.760 --> 2:46:24.800\n But anyway, so the sort of the promise of quantum computing\n\n2:46:24.800 --> 2:46:28.320\n is let's say you're trying to factor an integer.\n\n2:46:28.320 --> 2:46:30.040\n Well, you can, instead of,\n\n2:46:30.040 --> 2:46:31.560\n when you factor an integer, you might say,\n\n2:46:31.560 --> 2:46:32.720\n well, does this factor work?\n\n2:46:32.720 --> 2:46:33.560\n Does this factor work?\n\n2:46:33.560 --> 2:46:34.680\n Does this factor work?\n\n2:46:35.680 --> 2:46:37.160\n In ordinary computing,\n\n2:46:37.160 --> 2:46:39.120\n it seems like we pretty much just have to try\n\n2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:40.520\n all these different factors,\n\n2:46:41.680 --> 2:46:43.160\n kind of one after another.\n\n2:46:43.160 --> 2:46:45.200\n But in quantum mechanics, you might have the idea,\n\n2:46:45.200 --> 2:46:48.360\n oh, you can just sort of have the physics,\n\n2:46:48.360 --> 2:46:51.320\n try all of them in parallel, okay?\n\n2:46:51.320 --> 2:46:56.120\n And there's this algorithm, Shor's algorithm,\n\n2:46:56.120 --> 2:46:58.760\n which allows you,\n\n2:46:58.760 --> 2:47:01.080\n according to the formalism of quantum mechanics,\n\n2:47:01.080 --> 2:47:02.400\n to do everything in parallel\n\n2:47:02.400 --> 2:47:05.320\n and to do it much faster than you can on a classical computer.\n\n2:47:05.320 --> 2:47:08.120\n Okay, the only little footnote is\n\n2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:09.920\n you have to figure out what the answer is.\n\n2:47:09.920 --> 2:47:12.000\n You have to measure the result.\n\n2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:13.960\n So the quantum mechanics internally has figured out\n\n2:47:13.960 --> 2:47:15.520\n all these different branches,\n\n2:47:15.520 --> 2:47:17.880\n but then you have to pull all these branches together\n\n2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:21.040\n to say, and the classical answer is this, okay?\n\n2:47:21.040 --> 2:47:22.600\n The standard theory of quantum mechanics\n\n2:47:22.600 --> 2:47:24.200\n does not tell you how to do that.\n\n2:47:24.200 --> 2:47:26.160\n It tells you how the branching works,\n\n2:47:26.160 --> 2:47:27.880\n but it doesn't tell you the process\n\n2:47:27.880 --> 2:47:30.240\n of corralling all these things together.\n\n2:47:30.240 --> 2:47:32.800\n And that process, which intuitively you can see\n\n2:47:32.800 --> 2:47:34.400\n is gonna be kind of tricky,\n\n2:47:34.400 --> 2:47:37.080\n but our model actually does tell you\n\n2:47:37.080 --> 2:47:40.200\n how that process of pulling things together works.\n\n2:47:40.200 --> 2:47:42.880\n And the answer seems to be, we're not absolutely sure.\n\n2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:45.320\n We've only got to two times three so far\n\n2:47:46.720 --> 2:47:50.520\n which is kind of in this factorization\n\n2:47:50.520 --> 2:47:51.360\n in quantum computers.\n\n2:47:51.360 --> 2:47:55.440\n But we can, what seems to be the case\n\n2:47:55.440 --> 2:47:58.520\n is that the advantage you get from the parallelization\n\n2:47:58.520 --> 2:48:01.200\n from quantum mechanics is lost\n\n2:48:01.200 --> 2:48:03.520\n from the amount that you have to spend\n\n2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:05.320\n pulling together all those parallel threads\n\n2:48:05.320 --> 2:48:07.680\n to get to a classical answer at the end.\n\n2:48:07.680 --> 2:48:10.280\n Now, that phenomenon is not unrelated\n\n2:48:10.280 --> 2:48:11.880\n to various decoherence phenomena\n\n2:48:11.880 --> 2:48:14.320\n that are seen in practical quantum computers and so on.\n\n2:48:14.320 --> 2:48:16.760\n I mean, I should say as a very practical point,\n\n2:48:16.760 --> 2:48:19.080\n I mean, it's like, should people stop bothering\n\n2:48:19.080 --> 2:48:20.760\n to do quantum computing research?\n\n2:48:20.760 --> 2:48:23.120\n No, because what they're really doing\n\n2:48:23.120 --> 2:48:25.240\n is they're trying to use physics\n\n2:48:25.240 --> 2:48:28.720\n to get to a new level of what's possible in computing.\n\n2:48:28.720 --> 2:48:30.920\n And that's a completely valid activity.\n\n2:48:30.920 --> 2:48:33.400\n Whether you can really put, you know,\n\n2:48:33.400 --> 2:48:34.240\n whether you can say,\n\n2:48:34.240 --> 2:48:36.000\n oh, you can solve an NP complete problem.\n\n2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:39.120\n You can reduce exponential time to polynomial time.\n\n2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:40.600\n You know, we're not sure.\n\n2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:43.080\n And I'm suspecting the answer is no,\n\n2:48:43.080 --> 2:48:46.080\n but that's not relevant to the practical speed ups\n\n2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:48.520\n you can get by using different kinds of technologies,\n\n2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:52.320\n different kinds of physics to do basic computing.\n\n2:48:52.320 --> 2:48:53.680\n But you're saying, I mean,\n\n2:48:53.680 --> 2:48:55.280\n some of the models you're playing with,\n\n2:48:55.280 --> 2:49:00.280\n the indication is that to get all the sheep back together\n\n2:49:02.640 --> 2:49:05.960\n and, you know, to corral everything together,\n\n2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:10.120\n to get the actual solution to the algorithm is...\n\n2:49:10.120 --> 2:49:10.960\n You lose all the...\n\n2:49:10.960 --> 2:49:12.240\n You lose all of the...\n\n2:49:12.240 --> 2:49:14.400\n By the way, I mean, so again, this question,\n\n2:49:14.400 --> 2:49:16.600\n do we actually know what we're talking about\n\n2:49:16.600 --> 2:49:18.240\n about quantum computing and so on?\n\n2:49:18.240 --> 2:49:22.440\n So again, we're doing proof by compilation.\n\n2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:24.880\n So we have a quantum computing framework\n\n2:49:24.880 --> 2:49:26.080\n in Wolfram language,\n\n2:49:26.080 --> 2:49:26.920\n and which is, you know,\n\n2:49:26.920 --> 2:49:28.360\n a standard quantum computing framework\n\n2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:31.080\n that represents things in terms of the standard,\n\n2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:32.840\n you know, formalism of quantum mechanics.\n\n2:49:32.840 --> 2:49:36.920\n And we have a compiler that simply compiles\n\n2:49:36.920 --> 2:49:41.520\n the representation of quantum gates into multiway systems.\n\n2:49:41.520 --> 2:49:43.920\n So, and in fact, the message that I got\n\n2:49:43.920 --> 2:49:46.000\n was from somebody who's working on the project\n\n2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:50.360\n who has managed to compile one of the sort of\n\n2:49:50.360 --> 2:49:53.200\n a core formalism based on category theory\n\n2:49:53.200 --> 2:49:57.520\n and core quantum formalism into multiway systems.\n\n2:49:57.520 --> 2:49:58.360\n So this is...\n\n2:49:58.360 --> 2:50:00.160\n When you say multiway system, these multiway graphs?\n\n2:50:00.160 --> 2:50:01.000\n Yes.\n\n2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:02.000\n So you're compiling...\n\n2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:03.200\n Yeah, okay, that's awesome.\n\n2:50:03.200 --> 2:50:05.200\n And then you can do all kinds of experiments\n\n2:50:05.200 --> 2:50:06.280\n on that multiway graph.\n\n2:50:06.280 --> 2:50:08.640\n Right, but the point is that what we're saying is\n\n2:50:08.640 --> 2:50:10.400\n the thing we've got this representation\n\n2:50:10.400 --> 2:50:12.000\n of let's say Shor's algorithm\n\n2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:14.040\n in terms of standard quantum gates.\n\n2:50:14.040 --> 2:50:17.480\n And it's just a pure matter of sort of computation\n\n2:50:17.480 --> 2:50:19.240\n to just say that is equivalent.\n\n2:50:19.240 --> 2:50:23.360\n We will get the same result as running this multiway system.\n\n2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:26.640\n Can you do complexity analysis on that multiway system?\n\n2:50:26.640 --> 2:50:28.600\n Well, that's what we've been trying to do, yes.\n\n2:50:28.600 --> 2:50:29.440\n We're getting there.\n\n2:50:29.440 --> 2:50:30.280\n We haven't done that yet.\n\n2:50:30.280 --> 2:50:32.520\n I mean, there's a pretty good indication\n\n2:50:32.520 --> 2:50:33.480\n of how that's gonna work out.\n\n2:50:33.480 --> 2:50:36.280\n We've done, as I say, our computer experiments.\n\n2:50:36.280 --> 2:50:39.440\n We've unimpressively gotten to about two times three\n\n2:50:39.440 --> 2:50:41.080\n in terms of factorization,\n\n2:50:41.080 --> 2:50:43.120\n which is kind of about how far people have got\n\n2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:45.440\n with physical quantum computers as well.\n\n2:50:45.440 --> 2:50:48.040\n But yes, we will be able to do...\n\n2:50:48.040 --> 2:50:50.480\n We definitely will be able to do complexity analysis\n\n2:50:50.480 --> 2:50:51.800\n and we will be able to know.\n\n2:50:51.800 --> 2:50:55.240\n So the one remaining hope for quantum computing\n\n2:50:55.240 --> 2:50:58.200\n really, really working at this formal level\n\n2:50:58.200 --> 2:51:01.120\n of quantum brand exponential stuff being done\n\n2:51:01.120 --> 2:51:03.080\n in polynomial time and so on.\n\n2:51:03.080 --> 2:51:05.280\n The one hope, which is very bizarre,\n\n2:51:05.280 --> 2:51:09.000\n is that you can kind of piggyback\n\n2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:11.240\n on the expansion of branchial space.\n\n2:51:11.240 --> 2:51:13.480\n So here's how that might work.\n\n2:51:13.480 --> 2:51:17.160\n So you think, you know, energy conservation,\n\n2:51:17.160 --> 2:51:18.720\n standard thing in high school physics,\n\n2:51:18.720 --> 2:51:20.600\n energy is conserved, right?\n\n2:51:20.600 --> 2:51:23.640\n But now you imagine, you think about energy\n\n2:51:23.640 --> 2:51:25.000\n in the context of cosmology\n\n2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:26.920\n and the context of the whole universe.\n\n2:51:26.920 --> 2:51:28.680\n It's a much more complicated story.\n\n2:51:28.680 --> 2:51:30.800\n The expansion of the universe kind of violates\n\n2:51:30.800 --> 2:51:32.520\n energy conservation.\n\n2:51:32.520 --> 2:51:35.000\n And so for example, if you imagine you've got two galaxies,\n\n2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:37.080\n they're receding from each other very quickly.\n\n2:51:37.080 --> 2:51:39.400\n They've got two big central black holes.\n\n2:51:39.400 --> 2:51:43.040\n You connect a spring between these two central black holes.\n\n2:51:43.040 --> 2:51:44.640\n Not easy to do in practice,\n\n2:51:44.640 --> 2:51:46.600\n but let's imagine you could do it.\n\n2:51:46.600 --> 2:51:49.200\n Now that spring is being pulled apart.\n\n2:51:49.200 --> 2:51:52.400\n It's getting more potential energy in the spring\n\n2:51:52.400 --> 2:51:55.120\n as a result of the expansion of the universe.\n\n2:51:55.120 --> 2:51:59.040\n So in a sense, you are piggybacking on the expansion\n\n2:51:59.040 --> 2:52:00.520\n that exists in the universe\n\n2:52:00.520 --> 2:52:03.120\n and the sort of violation of energy conservation\n\n2:52:03.120 --> 2:52:05.840\n that's associated with that cosmological expansion\n\n2:52:05.840 --> 2:52:07.160\n to essentially get energy.\n\n2:52:07.160 --> 2:52:09.680\n You're essentially building a perpetual motion machine\n\n2:52:09.680 --> 2:52:12.400\n by using the expansion of the universe.\n\n2:52:12.400 --> 2:52:15.280\n And that is a physical version of that.\n\n2:52:15.280 --> 2:52:17.640\n It is conceivable that the same thing can be done\n\n2:52:17.640 --> 2:52:22.640\n in branchial space to essentially mine the expansion\n\n2:52:22.640 --> 2:52:24.880\n of the universe in branchial space\n\n2:52:24.880 --> 2:52:29.880\n as a way to get sort of quantum computing for free,\n\n2:52:29.880 --> 2:52:32.280\n so to speak, just from the expansion of the universe\n\n2:52:32.280 --> 2:52:33.520\n in branchial space.\n\n2:52:33.520 --> 2:52:35.840\n Now, the physical space version is kind of absurd\n\n2:52:35.840 --> 2:52:39.520\n and involves springs between black holes and so on.\n\n2:52:39.520 --> 2:52:42.080\n It's conceivable that the branchial space version\n\n2:52:42.080 --> 2:52:43.560\n is not as absurd\n\n2:52:43.560 --> 2:52:45.840\n and that it's actually something you can reach\n\n2:52:45.840 --> 2:52:48.600\n with physical things you can build in labs and so on.\n\n2:52:48.600 --> 2:52:49.680\n We don't know yet.\n\n2:52:49.680 --> 2:52:51.320\n Okay, so like you were saying,\n\n2:52:51.320 --> 2:52:54.040\n the branch of space might be expanding\n\n2:52:54.040 --> 2:52:57.120\n and there might be something that could be exploited.\n\n2:52:57.120 --> 2:52:59.040\n Right, in the same kind of way\n\n2:52:59.040 --> 2:53:03.720\n that you can exploit that expansion of the universe\n\n2:53:03.720 --> 2:53:06.560\n in principle, in physical space.\n\n2:53:06.560 --> 2:53:08.520\n You just have like a glimmer of hope.\n\n2:53:08.520 --> 2:53:09.640\n Right, I think that the,\n\n2:53:09.640 --> 2:53:11.800\n look, I think the real answer is going to be\n\n2:53:11.800 --> 2:53:13.960\n that for practical purposes,\n\n2:53:13.960 --> 2:53:18.240\n the official brand that says you can do exponential things\n\n2:53:18.240 --> 2:53:20.480\n in polynomial time is probably not gonna work.\n\n2:53:20.480 --> 2:53:22.320\n For people curious to kind of learn more,\n\n2:53:22.320 --> 2:53:24.680\n so this is more like, it's not middle school,\n\n2:53:24.680 --> 2:53:27.880\n we're gonna go to elementary school for a second.\n\n2:53:27.880 --> 2:53:30.320\n Maybe middle school, let's go to middle school.\n\n2:53:31.320 --> 2:53:36.320\n So if I were to try to maybe write a pamphlet\n\n2:53:38.280 --> 2:53:41.920\n of like Wolfram physics project for dummies,\n\n2:53:42.760 --> 2:53:47.280\n AKA for me, or maybe make a video on the basics,\n\n2:53:47.280 --> 2:53:51.240\n but not just the basics of the physics project,\n\n2:53:51.240 --> 2:53:58.240\n but the basics plus the most beautiful central ideas.\n\n2:53:59.280 --> 2:54:01.200\n How would you go about doing that?\n\n2:54:01.200 --> 2:54:02.720\n Could you help me out a little bit?\n\n2:54:02.720 --> 2:54:05.760\n Yeah, yeah, I mean, as a really practical matter,\n\n2:54:05.760 --> 2:54:10.280\n we have this kind of visual summary picture that we made,\n\n2:54:10.280 --> 2:54:12.320\n which I think is a pretty good,\n\n2:54:12.320 --> 2:54:14.520\n when I've tried to explain this to people\n\n2:54:14.520 --> 2:54:17.120\n and it's a pretty good place to start.\n\n2:54:17.120 --> 2:54:19.800\n As you got this rule, you apply the rule,\n\n2:54:19.800 --> 2:54:22.760\n you're building up this big hypergraph,\n\n2:54:22.760 --> 2:54:24.560\n you've got all these possibilities,\n\n2:54:24.560 --> 2:54:25.960\n you're kind of thinking about that\n\n2:54:25.960 --> 2:54:27.680\n in terms of quantum mechanics.\n\n2:54:27.680 --> 2:54:30.640\n I mean, that's a decent place to start.\n\n2:54:30.640 --> 2:54:33.000\n So basically the things we've talked about,\n\n2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:36.240\n which is space represented as a hypergraph,\n\n2:54:37.120 --> 2:54:40.760\n transformation of that space is kind of time.\n\n2:54:40.760 --> 2:54:41.600\n Yes.\n\n2:54:41.600 --> 2:54:43.040\n And then...\n\n2:54:43.040 --> 2:54:45.080\n Structure of that space,\n\n2:54:45.080 --> 2:54:47.840\n the curvature of that space has gravity.\n\n2:54:47.840 --> 2:54:49.440\n That can be explained without going anywhere\n\n2:54:49.440 --> 2:54:51.240\n near quantum mechanics.\n\n2:54:51.240 --> 2:54:53.120\n I would say that's actually easier to explain\n\n2:54:53.120 --> 2:54:54.320\n than special relativity.\n\n2:54:55.200 --> 2:54:58.440\n Oh, so going into general, so go into curvature.\n\n2:54:58.440 --> 2:54:59.880\n Yeah, I mean, special relativity,\n\n2:54:59.880 --> 2:55:03.520\n I think it's a little bit elaborate to explain.\n\n2:55:03.520 --> 2:55:05.600\n And honestly, you only care about it\n\n2:55:05.600 --> 2:55:06.840\n if you know about special relativity,\n\n2:55:06.840 --> 2:55:08.000\n if you know how special relativity\n\n2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:09.920\n is ordinarily derived and so on.\n\n2:55:09.920 --> 2:55:11.800\n So general relativity is easier.\n\n2:55:11.800 --> 2:55:12.800\n Is easier, yes.\n\n2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:13.800\n And then what about quantum?\n\n2:55:13.800 --> 2:55:16.320\n What's the easiest way to reveal...\n\n2:55:16.320 --> 2:55:19.320\n I think the basic point is just this.\n\n2:55:19.320 --> 2:55:22.160\n This fact that there are all these different branches,\n\n2:55:22.160 --> 2:55:25.320\n that there's this kind of map of how the branches work.\n\n2:55:25.320 --> 2:55:30.320\n And that, I mean, I think actually the recent things\n\n2:55:30.600 --> 2:55:32.280\n that we have about the double slit experiment\n\n2:55:32.280 --> 2:55:34.920\n are pretty good, because you can actually see this.\n\n2:55:34.920 --> 2:55:39.080\n You can see how the double slit phenomenon arises\n\n2:55:39.080 --> 2:55:41.360\n from just features of these graphs.\n\n2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:43.880\n Now, having said that,\n\n2:55:43.880 --> 2:55:47.080\n there is a little bit of sleight of hand there\n\n2:55:47.080 --> 2:55:49.880\n because the true story of the way\n\n2:55:49.880 --> 2:55:51.800\n that double slit thing works\n\n2:55:51.800 --> 2:55:55.080\n depends on the coordination of branchial space\n\n2:55:55.080 --> 2:55:57.800\n that, for example, in our internal team,\n\n2:55:57.800 --> 2:56:00.200\n there is still a vigorous battle going on\n\n2:56:00.200 --> 2:56:01.560\n about how that works.\n\n2:56:01.560 --> 2:56:04.320\n And what's becoming clear is...\n\n2:56:04.320 --> 2:56:05.880\n I mean, what's becoming clear\n\n2:56:05.880 --> 2:56:08.840\n is that it's mathematically really quite interesting.\n\n2:56:08.840 --> 2:56:10.720\n I mean, that is that there's a...\n\n2:56:10.720 --> 2:56:13.120\n It involves essentially putting space filling curves.\n\n2:56:13.120 --> 2:56:14.120\n You'll basically have a thing\n\n2:56:14.120 --> 2:56:15.840\n which is naturally two dimensional,\n\n2:56:15.840 --> 2:56:18.800\n and you're sort of mapping it into one dimension\n\n2:56:18.800 --> 2:56:20.000\n with a space filling curve.\n\n2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:21.640\n And it's like, why is it this space filling curve\n\n2:56:21.640 --> 2:56:23.360\n and another space filling curve?\n\n2:56:23.360 --> 2:56:26.560\n And that becomes a story about Riemann surfaces and things,\n\n2:56:26.560 --> 2:56:28.160\n and it's quite elaborate.\n\n2:56:29.200 --> 2:56:32.640\n But there's a more, a little bit sleight of hand way\n\n2:56:32.640 --> 2:56:36.680\n of doing it where it's surprisingly direct.\n\n2:56:36.680 --> 2:56:37.520\n It's...\n\n2:56:37.520 --> 2:56:42.520\n So a question that might be difficult to answer,\n\n2:56:42.520 --> 2:56:46.120\n but for several levels of people,\n\n2:56:46.120 --> 2:56:50.360\n could you give me advice on how we can learn more?\n\n2:56:50.360 --> 2:56:54.640\n Specifically, there is people that are completely outside\n\n2:56:54.640 --> 2:56:57.080\n and just curious and are captivated\n\n2:56:57.080 --> 2:57:00.880\n by the beauty of hypergraphs, actually.\n\n2:57:00.880 --> 2:57:04.040\n So people that just wanna explore, play around with this.\n\n2:57:04.040 --> 2:57:09.040\n Second level is people from, say, people like me\n\n2:57:09.040 --> 2:57:12.720\n who somehow got a PhD in computer science,\n\n2:57:12.720 --> 2:57:14.240\n but are not physicists.\n\n2:57:14.240 --> 2:57:16.600\n But fundamentally, the work you're doing\n\n2:57:16.600 --> 2:57:18.720\n is of computational nature.\n\n2:57:18.720 --> 2:57:20.480\n So it feels very accessible.\n\n2:57:20.480 --> 2:57:25.480\n So what can a person like that do to learn enough physics\n\n2:57:27.480 --> 2:57:31.640\n or not to be able to, one, explore the beauty of it,\n\n2:57:31.640 --> 2:57:36.640\n and two, the final level of contribute something\n\n2:57:36.640 --> 2:57:40.280\n of a level of even publishable,\n\n2:57:40.280 --> 2:57:43.240\n like strong, interesting ideas.\n\n2:57:43.240 --> 2:57:46.200\n So at all those layers, complete beginner,\n\n2:57:46.200 --> 2:57:49.560\n a CS person, and the CS person that wants to publish.\n\n2:57:49.560 --> 2:57:53.120\n I mean, I think that, I've written a bunch of stuff,\n\n2:57:53.120 --> 2:57:54.440\n a person called Jonathan Gorod,\n\n2:57:54.440 --> 2:57:56.160\n who's been a key person working on this project,\n\n2:57:56.160 --> 2:57:58.040\n has also written a bunch of stuff.\n\n2:57:58.040 --> 2:58:00.800\n And some other people started writing things too.\n\n2:58:00.800 --> 2:58:02.120\n And he's a physicist.\n\n2:58:02.120 --> 2:58:02.960\n Physicist.\n\n2:58:02.960 --> 2:58:05.240\n Well, he's, I would say, a mathematical physicist.\n\n2:58:05.240 --> 2:58:06.080\n Mathematical.\n\n2:58:06.080 --> 2:58:06.920\n Mathematical physicist.\n\n2:58:06.920 --> 2:58:08.800\n He's pretty mathematically sophisticated.\n\n2:58:08.800 --> 2:58:11.640\n He regularly outmathematicizes me.\n\n2:58:11.640 --> 2:58:14.720\n Yeah, strong mathematical physicist.\n\n2:58:14.720 --> 2:58:16.560\n Yeah, I looked at some of the papers.\n\n2:58:16.560 --> 2:58:19.440\n Right, but so, I mean,\n\n2:58:19.440 --> 2:58:22.440\n I wrote this kind of original announcement blog post\n\n2:58:22.440 --> 2:58:25.480\n about this project, which people seem to have found.\n\n2:58:25.480 --> 2:58:29.000\n I've been really happy, actually, that people who,\n\n2:58:30.880 --> 2:58:34.760\n people seem to have grokked key points from that,\n\n2:58:34.760 --> 2:58:37.400\n much deeper key points, people seem to have grokked\n\n2:58:37.400 --> 2:58:39.520\n than I thought they would grokk.\n\n2:58:39.520 --> 2:58:41.600\n And that's a kind of a long blog post\n\n2:58:41.600 --> 2:58:43.120\n that explains some of the things we talked about,\n\n2:58:43.120 --> 2:58:45.360\n like the hypergraph and the basic rules.\n\n2:58:45.360 --> 2:58:47.920\n And I don't, does it, I forget,\n\n2:58:47.920 --> 2:58:49.880\n it doesn't have any quantum mechanics in here.\n\n2:58:49.880 --> 2:58:51.920\n It does. It does.\n\n2:58:51.920 --> 2:58:54.720\n But we know a little bit more since that blog post\n\n2:58:54.720 --> 2:58:56.480\n that probably clarifies,\n\n2:58:56.480 --> 2:58:59.560\n but that blog post does a pretty decent job.\n\n2:58:59.560 --> 2:59:02.160\n And, you know, talking about things like, again,\n\n2:59:02.160 --> 2:59:03.000\n something we didn't mention,\n\n2:59:03.000 --> 2:59:04.960\n the fact that the uncertainty principle\n\n2:59:04.960 --> 2:59:07.760\n is a consequence of curvature in branchial space.\n\n2:59:07.760 --> 2:59:10.120\n How much physics should a person know\n\n2:59:10.120 --> 2:59:14.480\n to be able to understand the beauty of this framework\n\n2:59:14.480 --> 2:59:16.880\n and to contribute something novel?\n\n2:59:16.880 --> 2:59:20.200\n Okay, so I think that those are different questions.\n\n2:59:20.200 --> 2:59:23.840\n So, I mean, I think that the, why does this work?\n\n2:59:23.840 --> 2:59:25.560\n Why does this make any sense?\n\n2:59:27.440 --> 2:59:28.480\n To really know that,\n\n2:59:28.480 --> 2:59:32.040\n you have to know a fair amount of physics, okay?\n\n2:59:32.040 --> 2:59:33.520\n And for example, have a decent understanding.\n\n2:59:33.520 --> 2:59:35.040\n When you say, why does this work?\n\n2:59:35.040 --> 2:59:38.480\n You're referring to the connection between this model\n\n2:59:38.480 --> 2:59:40.600\n and general relativity, for example.\n\n2:59:40.600 --> 2:59:43.160\n You have to understand something about general relativity.\n\n2:59:43.160 --> 2:59:45.240\n There's also a side of this where just\n\n2:59:45.240 --> 2:59:47.880\n as the pure mathematical framework is fascinating.\n\n2:59:47.880 --> 2:59:48.720\n Yes.\n\n2:59:48.720 --> 2:59:50.360\n If you throw the physics out completely.\n\n2:59:50.360 --> 2:59:52.520\n Then it's quite accessible to, I mean, you know,\n\n2:59:52.520 --> 2:59:55.280\n I wrote this sort of long technical introduction\n\n2:59:55.280 --> 2:59:58.480\n to the project, which seems to have been very accessible\n\n2:59:58.480 --> 3:00:01.400\n to people who are, you know, who understand computation\n\n3:00:01.400 --> 3:00:04.960\n and formal abstract ideas, but are not specialists\n\n3:00:04.960 --> 3:00:07.240\n in physics or other kinds of things.\n\n3:00:07.240 --> 3:00:10.280\n I mean, the thing with the physics part of it is,\n\n3:00:10.280 --> 3:00:14.600\n you know, there's both a way of thinking\n\n3:00:14.600 --> 3:00:16.840\n and literally a mathematical formalism.\n\n3:00:16.840 --> 3:00:18.040\n I mean, it's like, you know,\n\n3:00:18.040 --> 3:00:19.960\n to know that we get the Einstein equations,\n\n3:00:19.960 --> 3:00:22.120\n to know we get the energy momentum tensor,\n\n3:00:22.120 --> 3:00:24.800\n you kind of have to know what the energy momentum tensor is.\n\n3:00:24.800 --> 3:00:25.880\n And that's physics.\n\n3:00:25.880 --> 3:00:29.240\n I mean, that's kind of graduate level physics basically.\n\n3:00:29.240 --> 3:00:33.360\n And so that, you know, making that final connection\n\n3:00:33.360 --> 3:00:37.440\n is requires some depth of physics knowledge.\n\n3:00:37.440 --> 3:00:38.880\n I mean, that's the unfortunate thing,\n\n3:00:38.880 --> 3:00:40.600\n the difference in machine learning and physics\n\n3:00:40.600 --> 3:00:42.880\n in the 21st century.\n\n3:00:42.880 --> 3:00:47.440\n Is it really out of reach of a year or two worth of study?\n\n3:00:47.440 --> 3:00:49.920\n No, you could get it in a year or two,\n\n3:00:49.920 --> 3:00:51.600\n but you can't get it in a month.\n\n3:00:51.600 --> 3:00:52.440\n Right.\n\n3:00:52.440 --> 3:00:53.280\n I mean.\n\n3:00:53.280 --> 3:00:56.160\n So, but it doesn't require necessarily like 15 years.\n\n3:00:56.160 --> 3:00:57.000\n No, it does not.\n\n3:00:57.000 --> 3:01:00.240\n And in fact, a lot of what has happened with this project\n\n3:01:00.240 --> 3:01:02.800\n makes a lot of this stuff much more accessible.\n\n3:01:02.800 --> 3:01:04.800\n There are things where it has been quite difficult\n\n3:01:04.800 --> 3:01:06.040\n to explain what's going on.\n\n3:01:06.040 --> 3:01:09.160\n And it requires much more, you know,\n\n3:01:09.160 --> 3:01:11.840\n having the concreteness of being able to do simulations,\n\n3:01:11.840 --> 3:01:15.160\n knowing that this thing that you might've thought\n\n3:01:15.160 --> 3:01:19.000\n was just an analogy is really actually what's going on,\n\n3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:21.040\n makes one feel much more secure\n\n3:01:21.040 --> 3:01:24.240\n about just sort of saying, this is how this works.\n\n3:01:24.240 --> 3:01:26.240\n And I think it will be, you know,\n\n3:01:26.240 --> 3:01:28.520\n the, I'm hoping the textbooks of the future,\n\n3:01:28.520 --> 3:01:30.480\n the physics textbooks of the future,\n\n3:01:30.480 --> 3:01:32.120\n there will be a certain compression.\n\n3:01:32.120 --> 3:01:33.360\n There will be things that used to be\n\n3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:35.240\n very much more elaborate because for example,\n\n3:01:35.240 --> 3:01:36.720\n even doing continuous mathematics\n\n3:01:36.720 --> 3:01:38.880\n versus this discrete mathematics,\n\n3:01:38.880 --> 3:01:40.680\n that, you know, to know how things work\n\n3:01:40.680 --> 3:01:41.800\n in continuous mathematics,\n\n3:01:41.800 --> 3:01:43.120\n you have to be talking about stuff\n\n3:01:43.120 --> 3:01:44.760\n and waving your hands about things.\n\n3:01:44.760 --> 3:01:47.120\n Whereas with discrete, the discrete version,\n\n3:01:47.120 --> 3:01:49.280\n it's just like, here is a picture.\n\n3:01:49.280 --> 3:01:50.920\n This is how it works.\n\n3:01:50.920 --> 3:01:53.240\n And there's no, oh, do we get the limit right?\n\n3:01:53.240 --> 3:01:55.560\n Did this, you know, did this thing that is of,\n\n3:01:55.560 --> 3:01:59.440\n you know, zero, you know, measure zero object,\n\n3:01:59.440 --> 3:02:01.960\n you know, interact with this thing in the right way.\n\n3:02:01.960 --> 3:02:03.400\n You don't have to have that whole discussion.\n\n3:02:03.400 --> 3:02:05.520\n It's just like, here's a picture, you know,\n\n3:02:05.520 --> 3:02:07.160\n this is what it does.\n\n3:02:07.160 --> 3:02:09.560\n And, you know, you can, then it takes more effort to say,\n\n3:02:09.560 --> 3:02:12.040\n what does it do in the limit when the picture gets very big?\n\n3:02:12.040 --> 3:02:13.120\n But you can do experiments\n\n3:02:13.120 --> 3:02:14.360\n to build up an intuition actually.\n\n3:02:14.360 --> 3:02:15.200\n Yes, right.\n\n3:02:15.200 --> 3:02:17.480\n And you can get sort of core intuition for what's going on.\n\n3:02:17.480 --> 3:02:20.160\n Now, in terms of contributing to this, the, you know,\n\n3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:23.240\n I would say that the study of the computational universe\n\n3:02:23.240 --> 3:02:24.520\n and how all these programs work\n\n3:02:24.520 --> 3:02:26.000\n in the computational universe,\n\n3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:28.760\n there's just an unbelievable amount to do there.\n\n3:02:28.760 --> 3:02:31.320\n And it is very close to the surface.\n\n3:02:31.320 --> 3:02:34.400\n That is, you know, high school kids,\n\n3:02:34.400 --> 3:02:36.080\n you can do experiments.\n\n3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:38.960\n It's not, you know, and you can discover things.\n\n3:02:38.960 --> 3:02:42.600\n I mean, you know, we, you can discover stuff about,\n\n3:02:42.600 --> 3:02:44.320\n I don't know, like this thing about expansion\n\n3:02:44.320 --> 3:02:45.160\n of branchial space.\n\n3:02:45.160 --> 3:02:47.760\n That's an absolutely accessible thing to look at.\n\n3:02:47.760 --> 3:02:50.680\n Now, you know, the main issue with doing these things\n\n3:02:50.680 --> 3:02:55.200\n is not, there isn't a lot of technical depth difficulty\n\n3:02:55.200 --> 3:02:56.040\n there.\n\n3:02:56.040 --> 3:02:58.040\n The actual doing of the experiments, you know,\n\n3:02:58.040 --> 3:03:01.360\n all the code is all on our website to do all these things.\n\n3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:03.880\n The real thing is sort of the judgment\n\n3:03:03.880 --> 3:03:05.600\n of what's the right experiment to do.\n\n3:03:05.600 --> 3:03:07.800\n How do you interpret what you see?\n\n3:03:07.800 --> 3:03:09.920\n That's the part that, you know,\n\n3:03:09.920 --> 3:03:11.840\n people will do amazing things with.\n\n3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:13.520\n And that's the part that, but,\n\n3:03:13.520 --> 3:03:17.040\n but it isn't like you have to have done 10 years of study\n\n3:03:17.040 --> 3:03:18.840\n to get to the point where you can do the experiments.\n\n3:03:18.840 --> 3:03:19.680\n You don't.\n\n3:03:19.680 --> 3:03:21.840\n That's a cool thing you can do experiments day one,\n\n3:03:21.840 --> 3:03:22.680\n basically.\n\n3:03:22.680 --> 3:03:25.040\n That's the amazing thing about,\n\n3:03:25.040 --> 3:03:27.240\n and you've actually put the tools out there.\n\n3:03:27.240 --> 3:03:28.080\n It's beautiful.\n\n3:03:28.080 --> 3:03:29.640\n It's mysterious.\n\n3:03:29.640 --> 3:03:32.720\n There's still, I would say, maybe you can correct me.\n\n3:03:32.720 --> 3:03:36.440\n It feels like there's a huge number of log hanging fruit\n\n3:03:36.440 --> 3:03:39.440\n on the mathematical side, at least not the physics side,\n\n3:03:39.440 --> 3:03:40.280\n perhaps.\n\n3:03:40.280 --> 3:03:42.800\n No, there's, look on the, on the, okay.\n\n3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:45.160\n On the physics side, we are,\n\n3:03:45.160 --> 3:03:48.440\n we're definitely in harvesting mode, you know.\n\n3:03:48.440 --> 3:03:50.960\n Of which, which fruit, the low hanging ones or?\n\n3:03:50.960 --> 3:03:52.560\n The low hanging ones, yeah, right.\n\n3:03:52.560 --> 3:03:54.200\n I mean, basically here's the thing.\n\n3:03:54.200 --> 3:03:56.120\n There's a certain list of, you know,\n\n3:03:56.120 --> 3:03:57.800\n here are the effects in quantum mechanics.\n\n3:03:57.800 --> 3:03:59.760\n Here are the effects in general activity.\n\n3:03:59.760 --> 3:04:02.240\n It's just like industrial harvesting.\n\n3:04:02.240 --> 3:04:04.480\n It's like, can we get this one, this one, this one,\n\n3:04:04.480 --> 3:04:05.560\n this one, this one?\n\n3:04:05.560 --> 3:04:07.560\n And the thing that's really, you know,\n\n3:04:07.560 --> 3:04:10.120\n interesting and satisfying, and it's like, you know,\n\n3:04:10.120 --> 3:04:11.520\n is one climbing the right mountain?\n\n3:04:11.520 --> 3:04:12.920\n Does one have the right model?\n\n3:04:12.920 --> 3:04:15.920\n The thing that's just amazing is, you know,\n\n3:04:15.920 --> 3:04:18.280\n we keep on like, are we going to get this one?\n\n3:04:18.280 --> 3:04:19.920\n How hard is this one?\n\n3:04:19.920 --> 3:04:22.920\n It's like, oh, you know, it looks really hard.\n\n3:04:22.920 --> 3:04:23.800\n It looks really hard.\n\n3:04:23.800 --> 3:04:25.820\n Oh, actually we can get it.\n\n3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:27.600\n And.\n\n3:04:27.600 --> 3:04:29.040\n And you're, you're continually surprised.\n\n3:04:29.040 --> 3:04:31.520\n I mean, it seems like I've been following your progress.\n\n3:04:31.520 --> 3:04:32.520\n It's kind of exciting.\n\n3:04:32.520 --> 3:04:34.320\n All the, in harvesting mode,\n\n3:04:34.320 --> 3:04:35.880\n all the things you're picking up along the way.\n\n3:04:35.880 --> 3:04:36.720\n Right, right.\n\n3:04:36.720 --> 3:04:38.320\n No, I mean, it's, it's the thing that is,\n\n3:04:38.320 --> 3:04:40.200\n I keep on thinking it's going to be more difficult\n\n3:04:40.200 --> 3:04:41.040\n than it is.\n\n3:04:41.040 --> 3:04:43.360\n Now that's a, you know, that's a, who knows what,\n\n3:04:43.360 --> 3:04:45.880\n I mean, the one thing, so the, the, the,\n\n3:04:45.880 --> 3:04:48.640\n the thing that's been a, was a big thing\n\n3:04:48.640 --> 3:04:50.900\n that I think we're, we're pretty close to.\n\n3:04:50.900 --> 3:04:52.480\n I mean, I can give you a little bit of the roadmap.\n\n3:04:52.480 --> 3:04:54.640\n It's sort of interesting to see, it's like,\n\n3:04:54.640 --> 3:04:55.720\n what are particles?\n\n3:04:55.720 --> 3:04:56.880\n What are things like electrons?\n\n3:04:56.880 --> 3:04:58.520\n How do they really work?\n\n3:04:58.520 --> 3:05:01.400\n Are you close to get like, what, what's a,\n\n3:05:01.400 --> 3:05:03.800\n are you close to trying to understand like the atom,\n\n3:05:03.800 --> 3:05:06.480\n the electrons, neutrons, protons?\n\n3:05:06.480 --> 3:05:08.080\n Okay, so this is, this is the stack.\n\n3:05:08.080 --> 3:05:10.600\n So the first thing we want to understand is\n\n3:05:11.680 --> 3:05:13.360\n the quantization of spin.\n\n3:05:13.360 --> 3:05:15.960\n So particles, they, they kind of spin,\n\n3:05:15.960 --> 3:05:18.120\n they have a certain angular momentum,\n\n3:05:18.120 --> 3:05:19.400\n that angular momentum,\n\n3:05:19.400 --> 3:05:22.280\n even though the masses of particles are all over the place,\n\n3:05:22.280 --> 3:05:25.920\n you know, the electron has a mass of 0.511 MeV,\n\n3:05:25.920 --> 3:05:28.760\n but you know, the proton is 938 MeV, et cetera, et cetera,\n\n3:05:28.760 --> 3:05:30.640\n et cetera, they're all kind of random numbers.\n\n3:05:30.640 --> 3:05:32.720\n The, the spins of all these particles\n\n3:05:32.720 --> 3:05:34.880\n are either integers or half integers.\n\n3:05:34.880 --> 3:05:38.440\n And that's a fact that was discovered in the 1920s, I guess.\n\n3:05:38.440 --> 3:05:43.440\n The, I think that we are close to understanding\n\n3:05:44.120 --> 3:05:45.800\n why spin is quantized.\n\n3:05:45.800 --> 3:05:48.280\n And that's a, and it, it appears to be\n\n3:05:48.280 --> 3:05:50.280\n a quite elaborate mathematical story\n\n3:05:50.280 --> 3:05:53.040\n about homotopic groups in twister space\n\n3:05:53.040 --> 3:05:54.400\n and all kinds of things.\n\n3:05:54.400 --> 3:05:58.000\n But bottom line is that seems within reach.\n\n3:05:58.000 --> 3:05:59.200\n And that's, that's a big deal\n\n3:05:59.200 --> 3:06:01.680\n because that's a very core feature of understanding\n\n3:06:01.680 --> 3:06:04.160\n how particles work in quantum mechanics.\n\n3:06:04.160 --> 3:06:07.280\n Another core feature is this difference between particles\n\n3:06:07.280 --> 3:06:10.600\n that obey the exclusion principle and sort of stay apart,\n\n3:06:10.600 --> 3:06:13.680\n that leads to the stability of matter and things like that,\n\n3:06:13.680 --> 3:06:15.360\n and particles that love to get together\n\n3:06:15.360 --> 3:06:18.120\n and be in the same state, things like photons,\n\n3:06:18.120 --> 3:06:22.160\n that, and that's what leads to phenomena like lasers,\n\n3:06:22.160 --> 3:06:23.800\n where you can get sort of coherently\n\n3:06:23.800 --> 3:06:25.280\n everything in the same state.\n\n3:06:25.280 --> 3:06:29.240\n That difference is the particles of integer spin\n\n3:06:29.240 --> 3:06:31.760\n are bosons like to get together in the same state,\n\n3:06:31.760 --> 3:06:34.440\n the particles of half integer spin are fermions,\n\n3:06:34.440 --> 3:06:37.520\n like electrons that they tend to stay apart.\n\n3:06:37.520 --> 3:06:41.800\n And so the question is, can we get that in our models?\n\n3:06:41.800 --> 3:06:45.400\n And, oh, just the last few days, I think we made,\n\n3:06:45.400 --> 3:06:47.920\n I mean, I think the story of,\n\n3:06:47.920 --> 3:06:51.400\n I mean, it's one of these things where we're really close.\n\n3:06:51.400 --> 3:06:53.680\n Is this connected fermions and bosons?\n\n3:06:53.680 --> 3:06:54.520\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n3:06:54.520 --> 3:06:57.720\n So this was what happens is what seems to happen, okay?\n\n3:06:57.720 --> 3:07:01.440\n It's, you know, subject to revision in the next few days.\n\n3:07:01.440 --> 3:07:04.200\n But what seems to be the case is that\n\n3:07:04.200 --> 3:07:06.360\n bosons are associated with essentially\n\n3:07:06.360 --> 3:07:08.400\n merging in multiway graphs,\n\n3:07:08.400 --> 3:07:10.440\n and fermions are associated with branching\n\n3:07:10.440 --> 3:07:11.920\n in multiway graphs.\n\n3:07:11.920 --> 3:07:15.120\n And that essentially the exclusion principle\n\n3:07:15.120 --> 3:07:18.320\n is the fact that in branchial space,\n\n3:07:18.320 --> 3:07:21.360\n things have a certain extent in branchial space\n\n3:07:21.360 --> 3:07:24.000\n that in which things are being sort of forced apart\n\n3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:26.280\n in branchial space, whereas the case of bosons,\n\n3:07:26.280 --> 3:07:29.400\n they get, they come together in branchial space.\n\n3:07:29.400 --> 3:07:32.360\n And the real question is, can we explain the relationship\n\n3:07:32.360 --> 3:07:34.520\n between that and these things called spinners,\n\n3:07:34.520 --> 3:07:37.440\n which are the representation of half integer spin particles\n\n3:07:37.440 --> 3:07:39.320\n that have this weird feature that usually when you go\n\n3:07:39.320 --> 3:07:41.520\n around 360 degree rotation,\n\n3:07:41.520 --> 3:07:43.400\n you get back to where you started from.\n\n3:07:43.400 --> 3:07:44.760\n But for a spinner, you don't get back\n\n3:07:44.760 --> 3:07:46.040\n to where you started from.\n\n3:07:46.040 --> 3:07:48.800\n It takes 720 degrees of rotation to get back\n\n3:07:48.800 --> 3:07:50.240\n to where you started from.\n\n3:07:50.240 --> 3:07:53.160\n And we are just, it feels like we are,\n\n3:07:53.160 --> 3:07:55.440\n we're just incredibly close to actually having that,\n\n3:07:55.440 --> 3:07:57.160\n understanding how that works.\n\n3:07:57.160 --> 3:07:59.000\n And it turns out, it looks like,\n\n3:07:59.000 --> 3:08:01.640\n my current speculation is that it's as simple\n\n3:08:01.640 --> 3:08:06.640\n as the directed hypergraphs versus undirected hypergraphs,\n\n3:08:07.760 --> 3:08:10.240\n the relationship between spinners and vectors.\n\n3:08:10.240 --> 3:08:11.800\n So, which is just interesting.\n\n3:08:11.800 --> 3:08:13.840\n Yeah, that would be interesting if these are all these kind\n\n3:08:13.840 --> 3:08:18.600\n of nice properties of this multi way graphs of branching\n\n3:08:18.600 --> 3:08:19.920\n and rejoining.\n\n3:08:19.920 --> 3:08:21.760\n Spinners have been very mysterious.\n\n3:08:21.760 --> 3:08:23.880\n And if that's what they turn out to be,\n\n3:08:23.880 --> 3:08:25.240\n there's going to be an easy explanation\n\n3:08:25.240 --> 3:08:26.080\n of what's going on.\n\n3:08:26.080 --> 3:08:27.160\n Directive versus undirective.\n\n3:08:27.160 --> 3:08:30.600\n It's just, and that's why there's only two different cases.\n\n3:08:30.600 --> 3:08:34.160\n It's why are spinners important in quantum mechanics?\n\n3:08:34.160 --> 3:08:35.680\n Can you just give a...\n\n3:08:35.680 --> 3:08:39.040\n Yeah, so spinners are important because they are,\n\n3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:41.480\n they're the representation of electrons\n\n3:08:41.480 --> 3:08:43.400\n which have half an inch of spin.\n\n3:08:43.400 --> 3:08:48.320\n They are, the wave functions of electrons are spinners.\n\n3:08:48.320 --> 3:08:51.280\n Just like the wave functions of photons are vectors,\n\n3:08:51.280 --> 3:08:54.280\n the wave functions of electrons are spinners.\n\n3:08:54.280 --> 3:08:58.040\n And they have this property that when you rotate\n\n3:08:58.040 --> 3:09:02.880\n by 360 degrees, they come back to minus one of themselves\n\n3:09:02.880 --> 3:09:06.760\n and take 720 degrees to get back to the original value.\n\n3:09:06.760 --> 3:09:08.560\n And they are a consequence of,\n\n3:09:10.640 --> 3:09:15.160\n we usually think of rotation in space as being,\n\n3:09:15.160 --> 3:09:18.720\n when you have this notion of rotational invariance\n\n3:09:18.720 --> 3:09:22.160\n and rotational invariance, as we ordinarily experience it,\n\n3:09:22.160 --> 3:09:23.280\n doesn't have the feature.\n\n3:09:23.280 --> 3:09:24.760\n If you go through 360 degrees,\n\n3:09:24.760 --> 3:09:26.440\n you go back to where you started from,\n\n3:09:26.440 --> 3:09:28.480\n but that's not true for electrons.\n\n3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:32.480\n And so that's why understanding how that works is important.\n\n3:09:32.480 --> 3:09:34.920\n Yeah, I've been playing with Mobius Strip\n\n3:09:34.920 --> 3:09:37.000\n quite a bit lately, just for fun.\n\n3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:37.840\n Yes, yes.\n\n3:09:37.840 --> 3:09:41.000\n It adds some funk, it has the same kind of funky properties.\n\n3:09:41.000 --> 3:09:41.840\n Yes, right, exactly.\n\n3:09:41.840 --> 3:09:43.560\n You can have this so called belt trick,\n\n3:09:43.560 --> 3:09:45.960\n which is this way of taking an extended object\n\n3:09:45.960 --> 3:09:47.600\n and you can see properties like spinners\n\n3:09:47.600 --> 3:09:50.200\n with that kind of extended object that...\n\n3:09:50.200 --> 3:09:51.720\n Yeah, it would be very cool if there's,\n\n3:09:51.720 --> 3:09:53.840\n it somehow connects the directive versus undirective.\n\n3:09:53.840 --> 3:09:54.680\n I think that's what it's gonna be.\n\n3:09:54.680 --> 3:09:57.480\n I think it's gonna be as simple as that, but we'll see.\n\n3:09:57.480 --> 3:09:59.680\n I mean, this is the thing that,\n\n3:09:59.680 --> 3:10:03.200\n this is the big sort of bizarre surprise is that,\n\n3:10:03.200 --> 3:10:07.720\n because I learned physics as probably, let's say,\n\n3:10:07.720 --> 3:10:10.080\n let's say a fifth generation in the sense that,\n\n3:10:10.080 --> 3:10:11.960\n if you go back to the 1920s and so on,\n\n3:10:11.960 --> 3:10:13.720\n there were the people who were originating\n\n3:10:13.720 --> 3:10:15.400\n quantum mechanics and so on.\n\n3:10:15.400 --> 3:10:16.280\n Maybe it's a little less than that.\n\n3:10:16.280 --> 3:10:19.760\n Maybe I was like a third generation or something.\n\n3:10:19.760 --> 3:10:23.560\n I don't know, but the people from whom I learned physics\n\n3:10:23.560 --> 3:10:26.760\n were the people who had been students of the students\n\n3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:28.920\n of the people who originated\n\n3:10:28.920 --> 3:10:31.240\n the current understanding of physics.\n\n3:10:31.240 --> 3:10:33.920\n And we're now at probably the seventh generation\n\n3:10:33.920 --> 3:10:35.080\n of physicists or something\n\n3:10:35.080 --> 3:10:38.320\n from the early days of 20th century physics.\n\n3:10:38.320 --> 3:10:43.320\n And whenever a field gets that many generations deep,\n\n3:10:43.360 --> 3:10:46.640\n it seems the foundations seem quite inaccessible.\n\n3:10:46.640 --> 3:10:48.160\n And they seem, it seems like\n\n3:10:48.160 --> 3:10:49.800\n you can't possibly understand that.\n\n3:10:49.800 --> 3:10:52.720\n We've gone through seven academic generations\n\n3:10:52.720 --> 3:10:55.320\n and that's been, you know, that's been this thing\n\n3:10:55.320 --> 3:10:58.600\n that's been difficult to understand for that long.\n\n3:10:58.600 --> 3:11:00.200\n It just can't be that simple.\n\n3:11:01.240 --> 3:11:03.800\n But in a sense, maybe that journey takes you\n\n3:11:03.800 --> 3:11:07.640\n to a simple explanation that was there all along.\n\n3:11:07.640 --> 3:11:08.480\n That's the whole. Right, right, right.\n\n3:11:08.480 --> 3:11:10.640\n I mean, you know, and the thing for me personally,\n\n3:11:10.640 --> 3:11:13.200\n the thing that's been quite interesting is, you know,\n\n3:11:13.200 --> 3:11:16.200\n I didn't expect this project to work in this way.\n\n3:11:16.200 --> 3:11:19.080\n And I, you know, but I had this sort of weird piece\n\n3:11:19.080 --> 3:11:21.840\n of personal history that I used to be a physicist\n\n3:11:21.840 --> 3:11:23.040\n and I used to do all this stuff.\n\n3:11:23.040 --> 3:11:26.880\n And I know, you know, the standard canon of physics,\n\n3:11:26.880 --> 3:11:28.760\n I knew it very well.\n\n3:11:28.760 --> 3:11:31.280\n And, you know, but then I'd been working\n\n3:11:31.280 --> 3:11:33.000\n on this kind of computational paradigm\n\n3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:35.120\n for basically 40 years.\n\n3:11:35.120 --> 3:11:38.800\n And the fact that, you know, I'm sort of now coming back\n\n3:11:38.800 --> 3:11:42.240\n to, you know, trying to apply that in physics,\n\n3:11:42.240 --> 3:11:44.920\n it kind of felt like that journey was necessary.\n\n3:11:44.920 --> 3:11:49.040\n Was this, when did you first try to play with a hypergraph?\n\n3:11:49.040 --> 3:11:50.520\n So what happened is,\n\n3:11:50.520 --> 3:11:53.320\n yeah, so what I had was, okay, so this is again,\n\n3:11:53.320 --> 3:11:56.320\n you know, one always feels dumb after the fact.\n\n3:11:56.320 --> 3:11:58.800\n It's obvious after the fact.\n\n3:11:58.800 --> 3:12:02.240\n But so back in the early 1990s,\n\n3:12:02.240 --> 3:12:05.240\n I realized that using graphs\n\n3:12:05.240 --> 3:12:07.760\n as a sort of underlying thing underneath space and time\n\n3:12:07.760 --> 3:12:09.720\n was going to be a useful thing to do.\n\n3:12:09.720 --> 3:12:12.760\n I figured out about multiway systems.\n\n3:12:12.760 --> 3:12:14.960\n I figured out the things about general relativity\n\n3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:17.400\n I'd figured out by the end of the 1990s.\n\n3:12:17.400 --> 3:12:20.040\n But I always felt there was a certain inelegance\n\n3:12:20.040 --> 3:12:21.880\n because I was using these graphs\n\n3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:23.880\n and there were certain constraints on these graphs\n\n3:12:23.880 --> 3:12:26.440\n that seemed like they were kind of awkward.\n\n3:12:26.440 --> 3:12:28.320\n It was kind of like, you can pick,\n\n3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:30.240\n it's like you couldn't pick any rule.\n\n3:12:30.240 --> 3:12:33.360\n It was like pick any number, but the number has to be prime.\n\n3:12:33.360 --> 3:12:34.600\n It was kind of like you couldn't,\n\n3:12:34.600 --> 3:12:36.920\n it was kind of an awkward special constraint.\n\n3:12:36.920 --> 3:12:38.400\n I had these trivalent graphs,\n\n3:12:38.400 --> 3:12:41.440\n graphs with just three connections from every node.\n\n3:12:41.440 --> 3:12:44.280\n Okay, so, but I discovered a bunch of stuff with that.\n\n3:12:44.280 --> 3:12:46.280\n And I thought it was kind of inelegant.\n\n3:12:46.280 --> 3:12:48.680\n And, you know, the other piece of sort of personal history\n\n3:12:48.680 --> 3:12:50.160\n is obviously I spent my life\n\n3:12:50.160 --> 3:12:52.960\n as a computational language designer.\n\n3:12:52.960 --> 3:12:55.160\n And so the story of computational language design\n\n3:12:55.160 --> 3:12:58.000\n is a story of how do you take all these random ideas\n\n3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:00.720\n in the world and kind of grind them down\n\n3:13:00.720 --> 3:13:02.720\n into something that is computationally\n\n3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:04.760\n as simple as possible.\n\n3:13:04.760 --> 3:13:06.680\n And so, you know, I've been very interested\n\n3:13:06.680 --> 3:13:09.280\n in kind of simple computational frameworks\n\n3:13:09.280 --> 3:13:12.600\n for representing things and have, you know,\n\n3:13:12.600 --> 3:13:15.800\n ridiculous amounts of experience in trying to do that.\n\n3:13:15.800 --> 3:13:18.280\n And actually all of those trajectories of your life\n\n3:13:18.280 --> 3:13:19.320\n kind of came together.\n\n3:13:19.320 --> 3:13:21.600\n So you make it sound like you could have come up\n\n3:13:21.600 --> 3:13:24.640\n with everything you're working on now decades ago,\n\n3:13:24.640 --> 3:13:26.440\n but in reality.\n\n3:13:26.440 --> 3:13:28.080\n Look, two things slowed me down.\n\n3:13:28.080 --> 3:13:30.280\n I mean, one thing that slowed me down was\n\n3:13:30.280 --> 3:13:32.840\n I couldn't figure out how to make it elegant.\n\n3:13:32.840 --> 3:13:35.600\n And that turns out hypergraphs were the key to that.\n\n3:13:35.600 --> 3:13:39.160\n And that I figured out about less than two years ago now.\n\n3:13:40.160 --> 3:13:43.360\n And the other, I mean, I think,\n\n3:13:43.360 --> 3:13:46.160\n so that was sort of a key thing.\n\n3:13:46.160 --> 3:13:49.760\n Well, okay, so the real embarrassment of this project, okay,\n\n3:13:49.760 --> 3:13:52.680\n is that the final structure that we have\n\n3:13:52.680 --> 3:13:55.840\n that is the foundation for this project\n\n3:13:55.840 --> 3:14:00.000\n is basically a kind of an idealized version,\n\n3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:03.560\n a formalized version of the exact same structure\n\n3:14:03.560 --> 3:14:05.640\n that I've used to build computational languages\n\n3:14:05.640 --> 3:14:07.160\n for more than 40 years.\n\n3:14:07.160 --> 3:14:09.840\n But it took me, but I didn't realize that.\n\n3:14:09.840 --> 3:14:11.280\n And, you know.\n\n3:14:11.280 --> 3:14:12.840\n And there yet may be others.\n\n3:14:12.840 --> 3:14:14.360\n So we're focused on physics now,\n\n3:14:14.360 --> 3:14:17.720\n but I mean, that's what the new kind of science was about.\n\n3:14:17.720 --> 3:14:19.120\n Same kind of stuff.\n\n3:14:19.120 --> 3:14:21.720\n And this, in terms of mathematically,\n\n3:14:21.720 --> 3:14:22.960\n well, the beauty of it.\n\n3:14:22.960 --> 3:14:26.160\n So there could be entire other kind of objects\n\n3:14:26.160 --> 3:14:27.600\n that are useful for,\n\n3:14:27.600 --> 3:14:29.760\n like we're not talking about, you know,\n\n3:14:29.760 --> 3:14:31.760\n machine learning, for example.\n\n3:14:31.760 --> 3:14:33.880\n Maybe there's other variants of the hypergraph\n\n3:14:33.880 --> 3:14:35.720\n that are very useful for reasoning.\n\n3:14:35.720 --> 3:14:37.440\n Well, we'll see whether the multiway graph\n\n3:14:37.440 --> 3:14:40.320\n or machine learning system is interesting.\n\n3:14:40.320 --> 3:14:41.480\n Okay.\n\n3:14:41.480 --> 3:14:42.320\n Let's leave it at that.\n\n3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:43.640\n That's conversation number three.\n\n3:14:43.640 --> 3:14:46.480\n That's, we're not gonna go there right now, but.\n\n3:14:47.440 --> 3:14:49.040\n One of the things you've mentioned\n\n3:14:49.040 --> 3:14:52.640\n is the space of all possible rules\n\n3:14:52.640 --> 3:14:55.200\n that we kind of discussed a little bit.\n\n3:14:55.200 --> 3:14:58.000\n That, you know, that could be, I guess,\n\n3:14:58.000 --> 3:14:59.880\n the set of possible rules is infinite.\n\n3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:01.640\n Right.\n\n3:15:01.640 --> 3:15:04.200\n Well, so here's the big sort of one of the conundrums\n\n3:15:04.200 --> 3:15:07.840\n that I'm kind of trying to deal with is,\n\n3:15:07.840 --> 3:15:11.720\n let's say we think we found the rule for the universe\n\n3:15:11.720 --> 3:15:13.160\n and we say, here it is.\n\n3:15:13.160 --> 3:15:14.200\n You know, write it down.\n\n3:15:14.200 --> 3:15:15.800\n It's a little tiny thing.\n\n3:15:15.800 --> 3:15:18.000\n And then we say, gosh, that's really weird.\n\n3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:19.680\n Why did we get that one?\n\n3:15:20.640 --> 3:15:21.480\n Right.\n\n3:15:21.480 --> 3:15:23.240\n And then we're in this whole situation\n\n3:15:23.240 --> 3:15:25.480\n because let's say it's fairly simple.\n\n3:15:25.480 --> 3:15:27.680\n How did we come up the winners\n\n3:15:27.680 --> 3:15:30.400\n getting one of the simple possible universe rules?\n\n3:15:30.400 --> 3:15:33.600\n Why didn't we get what some incredibly complicated rule?\n\n3:15:33.600 --> 3:15:34.880\n Why do we get one of the simpler ones?\n\n3:15:34.880 --> 3:15:36.560\n And that's a thing which, you know,\n\n3:15:36.560 --> 3:15:38.800\n in the history of science, you know,\n\n3:15:38.800 --> 3:15:42.680\n the whole sort of story of Copernicus and so on was,\n\n3:15:42.680 --> 3:15:43.920\n you know, we used to think the earth\n\n3:15:43.920 --> 3:15:44.960\n was the center of the universe,\n\n3:15:44.960 --> 3:15:46.320\n but now we find out it's not.\n\n3:15:46.320 --> 3:15:47.760\n And we're actually just in some, you know,\n\n3:15:47.760 --> 3:15:50.480\n random corner of some random galaxy\n\n3:15:50.480 --> 3:15:53.800\n out in this big universe, there's nothing special about us.\n\n3:15:53.800 --> 3:15:58.120\n So if we get, you know, universe number 317\n\n3:15:58.120 --> 3:16:00.400\n out of all the infinite number of possibilities,\n\n3:16:00.400 --> 3:16:02.720\n how do we get something that small and simple?\n\n3:16:02.720 --> 3:16:05.040\n Right, so I was very confused by this.\n\n3:16:05.040 --> 3:16:06.720\n And it's like, what are we going to say about this?\n\n3:16:06.720 --> 3:16:08.560\n How are we going to explain this?\n\n3:16:08.560 --> 3:16:10.320\n And I thought it was, might be one of these things\n\n3:16:10.320 --> 3:16:13.320\n where you just, you know, you can get it to the threshold,\n\n3:16:13.320 --> 3:16:15.480\n and then you find out its rule number, such and such,\n\n3:16:15.480 --> 3:16:17.760\n and you just have no idea why it's like that.\n\n3:16:17.760 --> 3:16:19.120\n Okay, so then I realized\n\n3:16:20.040 --> 3:16:22.560\n it's actually more bizarre than that, okay?\n\n3:16:22.560 --> 3:16:25.040\n So we talked about multiway graphs.\n\n3:16:25.040 --> 3:16:26.760\n We talked about this idea that\n\n3:16:26.760 --> 3:16:29.040\n you take these underlying transformation rules\n\n3:16:29.040 --> 3:16:31.840\n on these hypergraphs, and you apply them\n\n3:16:31.840 --> 3:16:34.720\n wherever the rule can apply, you apply it.\n\n3:16:34.720 --> 3:16:37.680\n And that makes this whole multiway graph of possibilities.\n\n3:16:37.680 --> 3:16:39.960\n Okay, so let's go a little bit weirder.\n\n3:16:39.960 --> 3:16:42.800\n Let's say that at every place,\n\n3:16:42.800 --> 3:16:45.240\n not only do you apply a particular rule\n\n3:16:45.240 --> 3:16:47.160\n in all possible ways it can apply,\n\n3:16:47.160 --> 3:16:49.520\n but you apply all possible rules\n\n3:16:49.520 --> 3:16:51.920\n in all possible ways they can apply.\n\n3:16:51.920 --> 3:16:53.760\n As you say, that's just crazy.\n\n3:16:53.760 --> 3:16:54.920\n That's way too complicated.\n\n3:16:54.920 --> 3:16:57.240\n You're never going to be able to conclude anything.\n\n3:16:57.240 --> 3:17:00.800\n Okay, however, turns out that...\n\n3:17:00.800 --> 3:17:02.880\n Don't tell me there's some kind of invariance.\n\n3:17:02.880 --> 3:17:04.000\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n3:17:04.000 --> 3:17:06.440\n So what happens is...\n\n3:17:06.440 --> 3:17:08.080\n And that would be amazing.\n\n3:17:08.080 --> 3:17:11.240\n Right, so this thing that you get\n\n3:17:11.240 --> 3:17:13.360\n is this kind of ruleal multiway graph,\n\n3:17:13.360 --> 3:17:15.880\n this multiway graph that is a branching of rules\n\n3:17:15.880 --> 3:17:19.760\n as well as a branching of possible applications of rules.\n\n3:17:19.760 --> 3:17:22.080\n This thing has causal invariance.\n\n3:17:22.080 --> 3:17:25.320\n It's an inevitable feature that it shows causal invariance.\n\n3:17:25.320 --> 3:17:28.640\n And that means that you can take different reference frames,\n\n3:17:28.640 --> 3:17:30.920\n different ways of slicing this thing,\n\n3:17:30.920 --> 3:17:33.920\n and they will all in some sense be equivalent.\n\n3:17:33.920 --> 3:17:37.360\n If you make the right translation, they will be equivalent.\n\n3:17:37.360 --> 3:17:40.360\n So, okay, so the basic point here is...\n\n3:17:40.360 --> 3:17:43.040\n If that's true, that would be beautiful.\n\n3:17:43.040 --> 3:17:45.640\n It is true, and it is beautiful.\n\n3:17:45.640 --> 3:17:47.480\n It's not just an intuition, there is some...\n\n3:17:47.480 --> 3:17:50.120\n No, no, no, there's real mathematics behind this,\n\n3:17:50.120 --> 3:17:53.360\n and it is...\n\n3:17:53.360 --> 3:17:55.160\n Okay, so here's where it comes in.\n\n3:17:55.160 --> 3:17:57.360\n Yeah, that's amazing.\n\n3:17:57.360 --> 3:17:58.800\n Right, so by the way, I mean,\n\n3:17:58.800 --> 3:18:00.240\n the mathematics it's connected to\n\n3:18:00.240 --> 3:18:02.360\n is the mathematics of higher category theory\n\n3:18:02.360 --> 3:18:04.240\n and group voids and things like this,\n\n3:18:04.240 --> 3:18:05.880\n which I've always been afraid of,\n\n3:18:05.880 --> 3:18:09.960\n but now I'm finally wrapping my arms around it.\n\n3:18:09.960 --> 3:18:13.120\n But it's also related to...\n\n3:18:13.120 --> 3:18:16.160\n It also relates to computational complexity theory.\n\n3:18:16.160 --> 3:18:19.200\n It's also deeply related to the P versus NP problem\n\n3:18:19.200 --> 3:18:20.440\n and other things like this.\n\n3:18:20.440 --> 3:18:21.880\n Again, it seems completely bizarre\n\n3:18:21.880 --> 3:18:22.960\n that these things are connected,\n\n3:18:22.960 --> 3:18:25.160\n but here's why it's connected.\n\n3:18:25.160 --> 3:18:28.000\n This space of all possible...\n\n3:18:28.000 --> 3:18:32.080\n Okay, so a Turing machine, very simple model of computation.\n\n3:18:32.080 --> 3:18:34.280\n You know, you just got this tape\n\n3:18:34.280 --> 3:18:36.480\n where you write down, you know, ones and zeros\n\n3:18:36.480 --> 3:18:37.400\n or something on the tape,\n\n3:18:37.400 --> 3:18:40.120\n and you have this rule that says, you know,\n\n3:18:40.120 --> 3:18:41.520\n you change the number,\n\n3:18:41.520 --> 3:18:44.320\n you move the head on the tape, et cetera.\n\n3:18:44.320 --> 3:18:46.040\n You have a definite rule for doing that.\n\n3:18:46.040 --> 3:18:47.880\n A deterministic Turing machine\n\n3:18:47.880 --> 3:18:50.000\n just does that deterministically.\n\n3:18:50.000 --> 3:18:51.760\n Given the configuration of the tape,\n\n3:18:51.760 --> 3:18:53.600\n it will always do the same thing.\n\n3:18:53.600 --> 3:18:55.760\n A non deterministic Turing machine\n\n3:18:55.760 --> 3:18:58.960\n can have different choices that it makes at every step.\n\n3:18:58.960 --> 3:19:01.840\n And so, you know, you know this stuff,\n\n3:19:01.840 --> 3:19:04.440\n you probably teach this stuff.\n\n3:19:04.440 --> 3:19:09.200\n It, you know, so a non deterministic Turing machine\n\n3:19:09.200 --> 3:19:11.680\n has the set of branching possibilities,\n\n3:19:11.680 --> 3:19:14.360\n which is in fact, one of these multiway graphs.\n\n3:19:14.360 --> 3:19:16.240\n And in fact, if you say,\n\n3:19:16.240 --> 3:19:19.520\n imagine the extremely non deterministic Turing machine,\n\n3:19:19.520 --> 3:19:22.560\n the Turing machine that can just do,\n\n3:19:22.560 --> 3:19:25.440\n that takes any possible rule at each step,\n\n3:19:25.440 --> 3:19:27.520\n that is this real multiway graph.\n\n3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:31.280\n The set of possible histories\n\n3:19:31.280 --> 3:19:33.720\n of that extreme non deterministic Turing machine\n\n3:19:33.720 --> 3:19:35.880\n is a Rulio multiway graph.\n\n3:19:35.880 --> 3:19:37.680\n And you're, what term are you using?\n\n3:19:37.680 --> 3:19:38.520\n Rulio?\n\n3:19:38.520 --> 3:19:39.360\n Rulio.\n\n3:19:39.360 --> 3:19:40.200\n Rulio, I like it.\n\n3:19:40.200 --> 3:19:41.040\n It's a weird word.\n\n3:19:41.040 --> 3:19:41.880\n Yeah, it's a weird word, right?\n\n3:19:41.880 --> 3:19:44.160\n Rulio multiway graph.\n\n3:19:44.160 --> 3:19:45.880\n Okay, so this, so that.\n\n3:19:45.880 --> 3:19:47.560\n I'm trying to think of,\n\n3:19:48.880 --> 3:19:51.800\n I'm trying to think of the space of rules.\n\n3:19:51.800 --> 3:19:54.240\n So these are basic transformations.\n\n3:19:54.240 --> 3:19:55.760\n So in a Turing machine,\n\n3:19:55.760 --> 3:19:58.280\n it's like it says, move left, move, you know,\n\n3:19:58.280 --> 3:20:02.320\n if it's a one, if it's a black square under the head,\n\n3:20:02.320 --> 3:20:04.840\n move left and right to green square.\n\n3:20:04.840 --> 3:20:05.720\n That's a rule.\n\n3:20:05.720 --> 3:20:06.720\n That's a very basic rule,\n\n3:20:06.720 --> 3:20:09.880\n but I'm trying to see the rules on the hypergraphs,\n\n3:20:09.880 --> 3:20:12.200\n how rich of the programs can they be?\n\n3:20:12.200 --> 3:20:15.520\n Or do they all ultimately just map into something simple?\n\n3:20:15.520 --> 3:20:18.000\n Yeah, they're all, I mean, hypergraphs,\n\n3:20:18.000 --> 3:20:20.200\n that's another layer of complexity on this whole thing.\n\n3:20:20.200 --> 3:20:23.040\n You can think about these in transformations of hypergraphs,\n\n3:20:23.040 --> 3:20:24.360\n but Turing machines are a little bit simpler.\n\n3:20:24.360 --> 3:20:25.600\n You just think of it Turing machines, okay.\n\n3:20:25.600 --> 3:20:27.280\n Right, they're a little bit simpler.\n\n3:20:27.280 --> 3:20:29.120\n So if you look at these extreme\n\n3:20:29.120 --> 3:20:30.920\n non deterministic Turing machines,\n\n3:20:30.920 --> 3:20:35.120\n you're mapping out all the possible non deterministic paths\n\n3:20:35.120 --> 3:20:37.160\n that the Turing machine can follow.\n\n3:20:37.160 --> 3:20:41.040\n And if you ask the question, can you reach, okay,\n\n3:20:41.040 --> 3:20:44.800\n so a deterministic Turing machine follows a single path.\n\n3:20:44.800 --> 3:20:46.960\n The non deterministic Turing machine fills out\n\n3:20:46.960 --> 3:20:50.680\n this whole sort of ball of possibilities.\n\n3:20:50.680 --> 3:20:53.280\n And so then the P versus MP problem\n\n3:20:53.280 --> 3:20:55.160\n ends up being questions about,\n\n3:20:55.160 --> 3:20:56.760\n and we haven't completely figured out\n\n3:20:56.760 --> 3:20:57.600\n all the details of this,\n\n3:20:57.600 --> 3:20:59.920\n but it's basically has to do with questions\n\n3:20:59.920 --> 3:21:03.320\n about the growth of that ball relative\n\n3:21:03.320 --> 3:21:05.800\n to what happens with individual paths and so on.\n\n3:21:05.800 --> 3:21:07.800\n So essentially there's a geometrization\n\n3:21:07.800 --> 3:21:10.120\n of the P versus MP problem that comes out of this.\n\n3:21:10.120 --> 3:21:12.000\n That's a sideshow, okay.\n\n3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:14.960\n The main event here is the statement\n\n3:21:14.960 --> 3:21:19.960\n that you can look at this multiway graph\n\n3:21:19.960 --> 3:21:21.800\n where the branches correspond\n\n3:21:21.800 --> 3:21:24.200\n not just to different applications of a single rule,\n\n3:21:24.200 --> 3:21:28.200\n but to different applications of different rules, okay.\n\n3:21:28.200 --> 3:21:31.960\n And that then that when you say,\n\n3:21:31.960 --> 3:21:35.440\n I'm going to be an observer embedded in that system\n\n3:21:35.440 --> 3:21:36.960\n and I'm going to try and make sense\n\n3:21:36.960 --> 3:21:38.760\n of what's going on in the system.\n\n3:21:38.760 --> 3:21:43.040\n And to do that, I essentially am picking a reference frame\n\n3:21:43.040 --> 3:21:46.560\n and that turns out to be, well, okay.\n\n3:21:46.560 --> 3:21:48.600\n So the way this comes out essentially\n\n3:21:48.600 --> 3:21:50.720\n is the reference frame you pick\n\n3:21:50.720 --> 3:21:53.800\n is the rule that you infer is what's going on\n\n3:21:53.800 --> 3:21:57.440\n in the universe, even though all possible rules\n\n3:21:57.440 --> 3:22:01.240\n are being run, although all those possible rules\n\n3:22:01.240 --> 3:22:02.720\n are in a sense giving the same answer\n\n3:22:02.720 --> 3:22:04.560\n because of causal invariance.\n\n3:22:04.560 --> 3:22:08.480\n But what you see could be completely different.\n\n3:22:08.480 --> 3:22:10.360\n If you pick different reference frames,\n\n3:22:10.360 --> 3:22:12.920\n you essentially have a different description language\n\n3:22:12.920 --> 3:22:14.960\n for describing the universe.\n\n3:22:14.960 --> 3:22:17.320\n Okay, so what does this really mean in practice?\n\n3:22:17.320 --> 3:22:19.640\n So imagine there's us.\n\n3:22:19.640 --> 3:22:22.280\n We think about the universe in terms of space and time\n\n3:22:22.280 --> 3:22:25.000\n and we have various kinds of description models and so on.\n\n3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:29.040\n Now let's imagine the friendly aliens, for example, right?\n\n3:22:29.040 --> 3:22:31.320\n How do they describe their universe?\n\n3:22:31.320 --> 3:22:33.440\n Well, you know, our description of the universe\n\n3:22:33.440 --> 3:22:36.160\n probably is affected by the fact that, you know,\n\n3:22:36.160 --> 3:22:37.920\n we are about the size we are, you know,\n\n3:22:37.920 --> 3:22:40.240\n a meter ish tall, so to speak.\n\n3:22:40.240 --> 3:22:41.840\n We have brain processing speeds,\n\n3:22:41.840 --> 3:22:43.680\n we're about the speeds we have.\n\n3:22:43.680 --> 3:22:46.320\n We're not the size of planets, for example,\n\n3:22:46.320 --> 3:22:48.600\n where the speed of light really would matter.\n\n3:22:48.600 --> 3:22:50.040\n You know, in our everyday life,\n\n3:22:50.040 --> 3:22:51.800\n the speed of light doesn't really matter.\n\n3:22:51.800 --> 3:22:52.920\n Everything can be, you know,\n\n3:22:52.920 --> 3:22:55.200\n the fact that the speed of light is finite is irrelevant.\n\n3:22:55.200 --> 3:22:56.720\n It could as well be infinite.\n\n3:22:56.720 --> 3:22:58.480\n We wouldn't make any difference.\n\n3:22:58.480 --> 3:23:01.240\n You know, it affects the ping times on the internet.\n\n3:23:01.240 --> 3:23:06.040\n That's about the level of how we notice the speed of light.\n\n3:23:06.040 --> 3:23:07.400\n In our sort of everyday existence,\n\n3:23:07.400 --> 3:23:09.360\n we don't really notice it.\n\n3:23:09.360 --> 3:23:12.240\n And so we have a way of describing the universe\n\n3:23:12.240 --> 3:23:16.040\n that's based on our sensory, you know, our senses,\n\n3:23:17.240 --> 3:23:19.760\n these days also on the mathematics we've constructed\n\n3:23:19.760 --> 3:23:22.520\n and so on, but the realization is\n\n3:23:22.520 --> 3:23:24.160\n it's not the only way to do it.\n\n3:23:24.160 --> 3:23:28.200\n There will be completely, utterly incoherent descriptions\n\n3:23:28.200 --> 3:23:30.840\n of the universe, which correspond\n\n3:23:30.840 --> 3:23:34.240\n to different reference frames in this sort of ruleal space.\n\n3:23:34.240 --> 3:23:36.080\n In the ruleal space, that's fascinating.\n\n3:23:36.080 --> 3:23:38.200\n So we have some kind of reference frame\n\n3:23:38.200 --> 3:23:40.720\n in this ruleal space, and from that.\n\n3:23:41.680 --> 3:23:45.600\n That's why we are attributing this rule to the universe.\n\n3:23:45.600 --> 3:23:47.320\n So in other words, when we say,\n\n3:23:47.320 --> 3:23:49.440\n why is it this rule and not another,\n\n3:23:49.440 --> 3:23:52.280\n the answer is just, you know,\n\n3:23:52.280 --> 3:23:54.600\n shine the light back on us, so to speak.\n\n3:23:54.600 --> 3:23:57.240\n It's because of the reference frame that we've picked\n\n3:23:57.240 --> 3:23:58.960\n in our way of understanding what's happening\n\n3:23:58.960 --> 3:24:02.320\n in this sort of space of all possible rules and so on.\n\n3:24:02.320 --> 3:24:05.160\n But also in the space from this reference frame,\n\n3:24:06.120 --> 3:24:11.120\n because of the ruleal, the invariance,\n\n3:24:12.200 --> 3:24:17.200\n that simple, that the rule on which the universe,\n\n3:24:17.200 --> 3:24:19.840\n with which you can run the universe,\n\n3:24:19.840 --> 3:24:21.360\n might as well be simple.\n\n3:24:21.360 --> 3:24:23.720\n Yes, yes, but okay, so here's another point.\n\n3:24:23.720 --> 3:24:26.800\n So this is, again, these are a little bit mind twisting\n\n3:24:26.800 --> 3:24:31.400\n in some ways, but the, okay, another thing that's sort of,\n\n3:24:31.400 --> 3:24:34.640\n we know from computation is this idea\n\n3:24:34.640 --> 3:24:36.480\n of computation universality.\n\n3:24:36.480 --> 3:24:38.880\n The fact that given that we have a program\n\n3:24:38.880 --> 3:24:42.320\n that runs on one kind of computer, we can as well,\n\n3:24:42.320 --> 3:24:44.280\n you know, we can convert it to run\n\n3:24:44.280 --> 3:24:45.380\n on any other kind of computer.\n\n3:24:45.380 --> 3:24:47.880\n We can emulate one kind of computer with another.\n\n3:24:47.880 --> 3:24:50.640\n So that might lead you to say, well,\n\n3:24:50.640 --> 3:24:52.800\n you think you have the rule for the universe,\n\n3:24:52.800 --> 3:24:54.840\n but you might as well be running it on a Turing machine\n\n3:24:54.840 --> 3:24:59.000\n because we know we can emulate any computational rule\n\n3:24:59.000 --> 3:25:00.920\n on any kind of machine.\n\n3:25:00.920 --> 3:25:02.300\n And that's essentially the same thing\n\n3:25:02.300 --> 3:25:03.680\n that's being said here.\n\n3:25:03.680 --> 3:25:07.320\n That is that what we're doing is we're saying\n\n3:25:07.320 --> 3:25:11.280\n these different interpretations of physics correspond\n\n3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:13.400\n to essentially running physics\n\n3:25:13.400 --> 3:25:16.040\n on different underlying, you know,\n\n3:25:16.040 --> 3:25:18.140\n thinking about the physics as running in different\n\n3:25:18.140 --> 3:25:19.540\n with different underlying rules\n\n3:25:19.540 --> 3:25:22.980\n as if different underlying computers were running them.\n\n3:25:22.980 --> 3:25:26.060\n And, but because of computation universality\n\n3:25:26.060 --> 3:25:27.720\n or more accurately, because of this principle\n\n3:25:27.720 --> 3:25:30.360\n of computational equivalence thing of mine,\n\n3:25:30.360 --> 3:25:32.040\n there's that they are,\n\n3:25:33.520 --> 3:25:35.760\n these things are ultimately equivalent.\n\n3:25:35.760 --> 3:25:38.120\n So the only thing that is the ultimate fact\n\n3:25:38.120 --> 3:25:40.920\n about the universe, the ultimate fact that doesn't depend\n\n3:25:40.920 --> 3:25:42.760\n on any of these, you know, we don't have to talk\n\n3:25:42.760 --> 3:25:44.640\n about specific rules, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n3:25:44.640 --> 3:25:48.360\n The ultimate fact is the universe is computational\n\n3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:52.640\n and it is the things that happen in the universe\n\n3:25:52.640 --> 3:25:54.920\n are the kinds of computations that the principle\n\n3:25:54.920 --> 3:25:57.560\n of computational equivalence says should happen.\n\n3:25:57.560 --> 3:26:00.440\n Now that might sound like you're not really saying\n\n3:26:00.440 --> 3:26:03.920\n anything there, but you are because you can,\n\n3:26:03.920 --> 3:26:06.640\n you could in principle have a hyper computer\n\n3:26:06.640 --> 3:26:09.720\n that things that take an ordinary computer\n\n3:26:09.720 --> 3:26:12.000\n an infinite time to do the hyper computer can just say,\n\n3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:13.480\n oh, I know the answer.\n\n3:26:13.480 --> 3:26:15.720\n It's this immediately.\n\n3:26:15.720 --> 3:26:19.600\n What this is saying is the universe is not a hyper computer.\n\n3:26:19.600 --> 3:26:21.800\n It's not simpler than a,\n\n3:26:21.800 --> 3:26:24.040\n an ordinary Turing machine type computer.\n\n3:26:24.040 --> 3:26:28.080\n It's exactly like an ordinary Turing machine type computer.\n\n3:26:28.080 --> 3:26:30.040\n And so that's the, that's in the end,\n\n3:26:30.040 --> 3:26:34.000\n the sort of net net conclusion is that's the thing\n\n3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:36.600\n that is the sort of the hard immovable fact\n\n3:26:36.600 --> 3:26:38.000\n about the universe.\n\n3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:41.600\n That's sort of the fundamental principle of the universe\n\n3:26:41.600 --> 3:26:45.440\n is that it is computational and not hyper computational\n\n3:26:45.440 --> 3:26:47.280\n and not sort of infra computational.\n\n3:26:47.280 --> 3:26:50.360\n It is this level of computational ability\n\n3:26:50.360 --> 3:26:53.080\n and it's, it kind of has,\n\n3:26:53.080 --> 3:26:57.080\n and that's sort of the, the, the core fact, but now,\n\n3:26:57.080 --> 3:26:59.800\n you know, this, this idea that you can have these different\n\n3:26:59.800 --> 3:27:02.280\n kind of a rule reference frames,\n\n3:27:02.280 --> 3:27:05.280\n these different description languages for the universe.\n\n3:27:05.280 --> 3:27:08.840\n It makes me, you know, I used to think, okay, you know,\n\n3:27:08.840 --> 3:27:09.840\n imagine the aliens,\n\n3:27:09.840 --> 3:27:12.560\n imagine the extraterrestrial intelligence thing, you know,\n\n3:27:12.560 --> 3:27:15.560\n at least they experienced the same physics.\n\n3:27:15.560 --> 3:27:17.440\n And now I've realized it isn't true.\n\n3:27:17.440 --> 3:27:19.240\n They could have a different rule frame.\n\n3:27:19.240 --> 3:27:20.480\n That's fascinating.\n\n3:27:20.480 --> 3:27:23.920\n That they can end up with a, a, a,\n\n3:27:23.920 --> 3:27:26.040\n a description of the universe that is utterly,\n\n3:27:26.040 --> 3:27:28.040\n utterly incoherent with ours.\n\n3:27:28.040 --> 3:27:31.320\n And that's also interesting in terms of how we think about,\n\n3:27:31.320 --> 3:27:33.600\n well, intelligence, the nature of intelligence and so on.\n\n3:27:33.600 --> 3:27:35.440\n You know, I'm, I'm fond of the quote, you know,\n\n3:27:35.440 --> 3:27:38.640\n the weather has a mind of its own because these are,\n\n3:27:38.640 --> 3:27:41.040\n you know, these are sort of computationally that,\n\n3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:44.760\n that system is computationally equivalent to the system\n\n3:27:44.760 --> 3:27:46.560\n that is our brains and so on.\n\n3:27:46.560 --> 3:27:49.960\n And what's different is we don't have a way to understand,\n\n3:27:49.960 --> 3:27:52.520\n you know, what the weather is trying to do, so to speak.\n\n3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:54.880\n We have a story about what's happening in our brains.\n\n3:27:54.880 --> 3:27:56.680\n We don't have a sort of connection\n\n3:27:56.680 --> 3:27:57.800\n to what's happening there.\n\n3:27:57.800 --> 3:27:59.680\n So we actually, it's funny,\n\n3:27:59.680 --> 3:28:04.160\n last time we talked maybe over a year ago,\n\n3:28:04.160 --> 3:28:08.080\n we talked about how it was more based on your work\n\n3:28:08.080 --> 3:28:09.920\n with Arrival.\n\n3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:11.600\n We talked about how would we communicate\n\n3:28:11.600 --> 3:28:13.200\n with alien intelligences.\n\n3:28:14.160 --> 3:28:18.000\n Can you maybe comment on how we might,\n\n3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:20.720\n how the Wolfram Physics Project changed your view,\n\n3:28:20.720 --> 3:28:22.200\n how we might be able to communicate\n\n3:28:22.200 --> 3:28:23.280\n with alien intelligence?\n\n3:28:23.280 --> 3:28:25.040\n Like if they showed up,\n\n3:28:25.040 --> 3:28:30.040\n is it possible that because of our comprehension\n\n3:28:30.080 --> 3:28:33.640\n of the physics of the world might be completely different,\n\n3:28:33.640 --> 3:28:36.600\n we would just not be able to communicate at all?\n\n3:28:36.600 --> 3:28:41.520\n Here's the thing, you know, intelligence is everywhere.\n\n3:28:41.520 --> 3:28:43.800\n The fact this idea that there's this notion of,\n\n3:28:43.800 --> 3:28:45.080\n oh, there's gonna be this amazing\n\n3:28:45.080 --> 3:28:46.400\n extraterrestrial intelligence\n\n3:28:46.400 --> 3:28:48.760\n and it's gonna be this unique thing.\n\n3:28:48.760 --> 3:28:50.080\n It's just not true.\n\n3:28:50.080 --> 3:28:51.360\n It's the same thing.\n\n3:28:51.360 --> 3:28:53.240\n You know, I think people will realize this\n\n3:28:53.240 --> 3:28:54.840\n about the time when people decide\n\n3:28:54.840 --> 3:28:57.280\n that artificial intelligences are kind of\n\n3:28:57.280 --> 3:29:01.160\n just natural things that are like human intelligences.\n\n3:29:01.160 --> 3:29:04.520\n They'll realize that extraterrestrial intelligences\n\n3:29:04.520 --> 3:29:07.720\n or intelligences associated with physical systems\n\n3:29:07.720 --> 3:29:09.760\n and so on, it's all the same kind of thing.\n\n3:29:09.760 --> 3:29:11.160\n It's ultimately computation.\n\n3:29:11.160 --> 3:29:12.080\n It's all the same.\n\n3:29:12.080 --> 3:29:13.280\n It's all just computation.\n\n3:29:13.280 --> 3:29:17.160\n And the issue is, can you, are you sort of inside it?\n\n3:29:17.160 --> 3:29:19.200\n Are you thinking about it?\n\n3:29:19.200 --> 3:29:22.200\n Do you have sort of a story you're telling yourself\n\n3:29:22.200 --> 3:29:23.160\n about it?\n\n3:29:23.160 --> 3:29:25.200\n And you know, the weather could have a story\n\n3:29:25.200 --> 3:29:27.560\n it's telling itself about what it's doing.\n\n3:29:27.560 --> 3:29:30.920\n We just, it's utterly incoherent with the stories\n\n3:29:30.920 --> 3:29:33.560\n that we tell ourselves based on how our brains work.\n\n3:29:33.560 --> 3:29:37.080\n I mean, ultimately it must be a question\n\n3:29:37.080 --> 3:29:39.280\n whether we can align.\n\n3:29:39.280 --> 3:29:40.120\n Exactly.\n\n3:29:40.120 --> 3:29:41.960\n Align with the kind of intelligence.\n\n3:29:41.960 --> 3:29:42.800\n Right, right, right.\n\n3:29:42.800 --> 3:29:44.200\n So there's a systematic way of doing it.\n\n3:29:44.200 --> 3:29:45.520\n Right, so the question is in the space\n\n3:29:45.520 --> 3:29:47.240\n of all possible intelligences,\n\n3:29:47.240 --> 3:29:50.440\n what's the, how do you think about the distance\n\n3:29:50.440 --> 3:29:52.400\n between description languages\n\n3:29:52.400 --> 3:29:54.680\n for one intelligence versus another?\n\n3:29:54.680 --> 3:29:57.120\n And needless to say, I have thought about this\n\n3:29:57.120 --> 3:30:00.880\n and you know, I don't have a great answer yet,\n\n3:30:00.880 --> 3:30:02.920\n but I think that's a thing\n\n3:30:02.920 --> 3:30:04.440\n where there will be things that can be said\n\n3:30:04.440 --> 3:30:06.000\n and there'll be things that where you can sort of\n\n3:30:06.000 --> 3:30:08.400\n start to characterize, you know,\n\n3:30:08.400 --> 3:30:12.880\n what is the translation distance between this,\n\n3:30:12.880 --> 3:30:15.120\n you know, version of the universe\n\n3:30:15.120 --> 3:30:17.840\n or this kind of set of computational rules\n\n3:30:17.840 --> 3:30:18.800\n and this other one.\n\n3:30:18.800 --> 3:30:21.480\n In fact, okay, so this is a, you know,\n\n3:30:21.480 --> 3:30:23.560\n there's this idea of algorithmic information theory.\n\n3:30:23.560 --> 3:30:25.800\n There's this question of sort of what is the,\n\n3:30:25.800 --> 3:30:28.680\n when you have something,\n\n3:30:28.680 --> 3:30:31.520\n what is the sort of shortest description you can make of it\n\n3:30:31.520 --> 3:30:33.320\n where that description could be saying,\n\n3:30:33.320 --> 3:30:36.480\n run this program to get the thing, right?\n\n3:30:36.480 --> 3:30:41.480\n So I'm pretty sure that there will be a physicalization\n\n3:30:45.280 --> 3:30:47.720\n of the idea of algorithmic information\n\n3:30:47.720 --> 3:30:51.560\n and that, okay, this is again, a little bit bizarre,\n\n3:30:51.560 --> 3:30:54.480\n but so I mentioned that there's the speed of light,\n\n3:30:54.480 --> 3:30:57.560\n maximum speed of information transmission in physical space.\n\n3:30:57.560 --> 3:30:59.840\n There's a maximum speed of information transmission\n\n3:30:59.840 --> 3:31:02.920\n in branchial space, which is a maximum entanglement speed.\n\n3:31:02.920 --> 3:31:05.240\n There's a maximum speed of information transmission\n\n3:31:05.240 --> 3:31:07.160\n in ruleal space, which is,\n\n3:31:07.160 --> 3:31:10.600\n has to do with a maximum speed of translation\n\n3:31:10.600 --> 3:31:14.480\n between different description languages.\n\n3:31:14.480 --> 3:31:17.440\n And again, I'm not fully wrapped my brain around this one.\n\n3:31:17.440 --> 3:31:20.080\n Yeah, that one just blows my mind to think about that,\n\n3:31:20.080 --> 3:31:22.800\n but that starts getting closer to the, yeah,\n\n3:31:22.800 --> 3:31:25.280\n the intelligence. It's kind of a physicalization.\n\n3:31:25.280 --> 3:31:27.840\n Right, and it's also a physicalization\n\n3:31:27.840 --> 3:31:29.920\n of algorithmic information.\n\n3:31:29.920 --> 3:31:32.320\n And I think there's probably a connection between,\n\n3:31:32.320 --> 3:31:33.600\n I mean, there's probably a connection\n\n3:31:33.600 --> 3:31:36.600\n between the notion of energy and some of these things,\n\n3:31:36.600 --> 3:31:39.400\n which again, I hadn't seen all this coming.\n\n3:31:39.400 --> 3:31:41.120\n I've always been a little bit resistant\n\n3:31:41.120 --> 3:31:43.480\n to the idea of connecting physical energy\n\n3:31:43.480 --> 3:31:45.640\n to things in computation theory,\n\n3:31:45.640 --> 3:31:47.200\n but I think that's probably coming.\n\n3:31:47.200 --> 3:31:48.560\n And that's what essentially at the core\n\n3:31:48.560 --> 3:31:50.680\n with the physics project is\n\n3:31:50.680 --> 3:31:55.560\n that you're connecting information theory with physics.\n\n3:31:55.560 --> 3:31:56.880\n Yeah, it's computation.\n\n3:31:56.880 --> 3:31:59.560\n Computation with our physical universe.\n\n3:31:59.560 --> 3:32:00.400\n Yeah, right.\n\n3:32:00.400 --> 3:32:03.480\n I mean, the fact that our physical universe is,\n\n3:32:03.480 --> 3:32:05.720\n right, that we can think of it as a computation\n\n3:32:05.720 --> 3:32:08.760\n and that we can have discussions like,\n\n3:32:08.760 --> 3:32:11.000\n the theory of the physical universe\n\n3:32:11.000 --> 3:32:14.520\n is the same kind of a theory as the P versus MP problem\n\n3:32:14.520 --> 3:32:18.640\n and so on is really, I think that's really interesting.\n\n3:32:18.640 --> 3:32:21.520\n And the fact that, well, okay,\n\n3:32:21.520 --> 3:32:24.240\n so this kind of brings me to one more thing\n\n3:32:24.240 --> 3:32:26.120\n that I have to in terms of this sort of unification\n\n3:32:26.120 --> 3:32:29.640\n of different ideas, which is metamathematics.\n\n3:32:29.640 --> 3:32:30.520\n Yeah, let's talk about that.\n\n3:32:30.520 --> 3:32:31.680\n You mentioned that earlier.\n\n3:32:31.680 --> 3:32:34.760\n What the heck is metamathematics and...\n\n3:32:34.760 --> 3:32:36.880\n Okay, so here's what, okay.\n\n3:32:36.880 --> 3:32:38.840\n So what is mathematics?\n\n3:32:38.840 --> 3:32:43.840\n Mathematics, sort of at a lowest level,\n\n3:32:43.840 --> 3:32:47.400\n one thinks of mathematics as you have certain axioms.\n\n3:32:47.400 --> 3:32:51.840\n You say things like X plus Y is the same as Y plus X.\n\n3:32:51.840 --> 3:32:55.360\n That's an axiom about addition.\n\n3:32:55.360 --> 3:32:57.360\n And then you say, we've got these axioms\n\n3:32:57.360 --> 3:33:00.560\n and from these axioms, we derive all these theorems\n\n3:33:00.560 --> 3:33:02.880\n that fill up the literature of mathematics.\n\n3:33:02.880 --> 3:33:04.760\n The activity of mathematicians\n\n3:33:04.760 --> 3:33:06.800\n is to derive all these theorems.\n\n3:33:06.800 --> 3:33:10.360\n Actually, the axioms of mathematics are very small.\n\n3:33:10.360 --> 3:33:13.520\n You can fit, when I did my new kind of science book,\n\n3:33:13.520 --> 3:33:16.000\n I fit all of the standard axioms of mathematics\n\n3:33:16.000 --> 3:33:17.560\n on basically a page and a half.\n\n3:33:18.760 --> 3:33:19.640\n Not much stuff.\n\n3:33:19.640 --> 3:33:21.400\n It's like a very simple rule\n\n3:33:21.400 --> 3:33:24.000\n from which all of mathematics arises.\n\n3:33:24.000 --> 3:33:26.640\n The way it works though is a little different\n\n3:33:26.640 --> 3:33:31.640\n from the way things work in sort of a computation\n\n3:33:31.720 --> 3:33:33.440\n because in mathematics, what you're interested in\n\n3:33:33.440 --> 3:33:36.160\n is a proof and the proof says,\n\n3:33:36.160 --> 3:33:40.360\n from here, you can use, from this expression, for example,\n\n3:33:40.360 --> 3:33:43.040\n you can use these axioms to get to this other expression.\n\n3:33:43.040 --> 3:33:45.440\n So that proves these two things are equal.\n\n3:33:45.440 --> 3:33:49.040\n Okay, so we can begin to see how this has been going to work.\n\n3:33:49.040 --> 3:33:51.360\n What's gonna happen is there are paths\n\n3:33:51.360 --> 3:33:53.400\n in metamathematical space.\n\n3:33:53.400 --> 3:33:57.640\n So what happens is each, two different ways to look at it.\n\n3:33:57.640 --> 3:33:59.880\n You can just look at it as mathematical expressions\n\n3:33:59.880 --> 3:34:02.640\n or you can look at it as mathematical statements,\n\n3:34:02.640 --> 3:34:04.120\n postulates or something.\n\n3:34:04.120 --> 3:34:06.440\n But either way, you think of these things\n\n3:34:06.440 --> 3:34:11.440\n and they are connected by these axioms.\n\n3:34:11.480 --> 3:34:13.680\n So in other words, you have some fact\n\n3:34:14.760 --> 3:34:16.960\n or you have some expression, you apply this axiom,\n\n3:34:16.960 --> 3:34:18.840\n you get some other expression.\n\n3:34:18.840 --> 3:34:21.600\n And in general, given some expression,\n\n3:34:21.600 --> 3:34:23.880\n there may be many possible different expressions\n\n3:34:23.880 --> 3:34:24.840\n you can get.\n\n3:34:24.840 --> 3:34:27.320\n You basically build up a multiway graph\n\n3:34:27.320 --> 3:34:31.120\n and a proof is a path through the multiway graph\n\n3:34:31.120 --> 3:34:34.200\n that goes from one thing to another thing.\n\n3:34:34.200 --> 3:34:36.920\n The path tells you how did you get from one thing\n\n3:34:36.920 --> 3:34:37.760\n to the other thing.\n\n3:34:37.760 --> 3:34:40.680\n It's the story of how you got from this to that.\n\n3:34:40.680 --> 3:34:42.840\n The theorem is the thing at one end\n\n3:34:42.840 --> 3:34:44.640\n is equal to the thing at the other end.\n\n3:34:44.640 --> 3:34:46.880\n The proof is the path you go down\n\n3:34:46.880 --> 3:34:48.600\n to get from one thing to the other.\n\n3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:52.600\n You mentioned that G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem\n\n3:34:52.600 --> 3:34:53.560\n fits naturally there.\n\n3:34:53.560 --> 3:34:54.400\n How does it fit?\n\n3:34:54.400 --> 3:34:57.160\n Yeah, so what happens there is that the G\u00f6del's theorem\n\n3:34:57.160 --> 3:35:01.240\n is basically saying that there are paths of infinite length.\n\n3:35:01.240 --> 3:35:03.120\n That is that there's no upper bound.\n\n3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:04.240\n If you know these two things,\n\n3:35:04.240 --> 3:35:06.200\n you say, I'm trying to get from here to here,\n\n3:35:06.200 --> 3:35:07.920\n how long do I have to go?\n\n3:35:07.920 --> 3:35:10.800\n You say, well, I've looked at all the paths of length 10.\n\n3:35:10.800 --> 3:35:12.600\n Somebody says, that's not good enough.\n\n3:35:12.600 --> 3:35:14.720\n That path might be of length a billion.\n\n3:35:14.720 --> 3:35:17.400\n And there's no upper bound on how long that path is.\n\n3:35:17.400 --> 3:35:19.760\n And that's what leads to the incompleteness theorem.\n\n3:35:19.760 --> 3:35:24.480\n So I mean, the thing that is kind of an emerging idea\n\n3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:26.160\n is you can start asking,\n\n3:35:26.160 --> 3:35:27.840\n what's the analog of Einstein's equations\n\n3:35:27.840 --> 3:35:29.720\n in metamathematical space?\n\n3:35:29.720 --> 3:35:31.160\n What's the analog of a black hole\n\n3:35:31.160 --> 3:35:33.120\n in metamathematical space?\n\n3:35:33.120 --> 3:35:33.960\n What's the hope of this?\n\n3:35:33.960 --> 3:35:36.840\n So yeah, it's fascinating to model all the mathematics\n\n3:35:36.840 --> 3:35:37.680\n in this way.\n\n3:35:37.680 --> 3:35:38.520\n So here's what it is.\n\n3:35:38.520 --> 3:35:40.320\n This is mathematics in bulk.\n\n3:35:40.320 --> 3:35:44.000\n So human mathematicians have made a few million theorems.\n\n3:35:44.000 --> 3:35:45.800\n They've published a few million theorems.\n\n3:35:45.800 --> 3:35:48.400\n But imagine the infinite future of mathematics.\n\n3:35:48.400 --> 3:35:50.440\n Apply something to mathematics\n\n3:35:50.440 --> 3:35:52.360\n that mathematics likes to apply to other things.\n\n3:35:52.360 --> 3:35:53.520\n Take a limit.\n\n3:35:53.520 --> 3:35:56.320\n What is the limit of the infinite future of mathematics?\n\n3:35:56.320 --> 3:35:57.560\n What does it look like?\n\n3:35:57.560 --> 3:35:59.560\n What is the continuum limit of mathematics?\n\n3:35:59.560 --> 3:36:01.560\n What is the, as you just fill in\n\n3:36:01.560 --> 3:36:03.120\n more and more and more theorems,\n\n3:36:03.120 --> 3:36:04.040\n what does it look like?\n\n3:36:04.040 --> 3:36:05.040\n What does it do?\n\n3:36:05.040 --> 3:36:07.360\n How does, what kinds of conclusions can you make?\n\n3:36:07.360 --> 3:36:09.800\n So for example, one thing I've just been doing\n\n3:36:09.800 --> 3:36:10.960\n is taking Euclid.\n\n3:36:10.960 --> 3:36:12.760\n So Euclid, very impressive.\n\n3:36:12.760 --> 3:36:17.400\n He had 10 axioms, he derived 465 theorems, okay?\n\n3:36:17.400 --> 3:36:19.120\n His book, you know,\n\n3:36:19.120 --> 3:36:21.960\n that was the sort of defining book of mathematics\n\n3:36:21.960 --> 3:36:23.120\n for 2000 years.\n\n3:36:24.120 --> 3:36:25.640\n So you can actually map out,\n\n3:36:25.640 --> 3:36:28.800\n and I actually did this 20 years ago,\n\n3:36:28.800 --> 3:36:30.720\n but I've done it more seriously now.\n\n3:36:30.720 --> 3:36:32.640\n You can map out the theorem dependency\n\n3:36:32.640 --> 3:36:34.760\n of those 465 theorems.\n\n3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:37.520\n So from the axioms, you grow this graph,\n\n3:36:37.520 --> 3:36:39.200\n it's actually a multiway graph,\n\n3:36:39.200 --> 3:36:42.400\n of how all these theorems get proved from other theorems.\n\n3:36:42.400 --> 3:36:45.240\n And so you can ask questions about, you know,\n\n3:36:45.240 --> 3:36:46.080\n well, you can ask things like,\n\n3:36:46.080 --> 3:36:47.520\n what's the hardest theorem in Euclid?\n\n3:36:47.520 --> 3:36:48.840\n The answer is, the hardest theorem\n\n3:36:48.840 --> 3:36:50.960\n is that there are five platonic solids.\n\n3:36:50.960 --> 3:36:52.800\n That turns out to be the hardest theorem in Euclid.\n\n3:36:52.800 --> 3:36:55.320\n That's actually his last theorem in all his books.\n\n3:36:55.320 --> 3:36:56.160\n That's the final.\n\n3:36:56.160 --> 3:36:58.440\n What's the hardness, the distance you have to travel?\n\n3:36:58.440 --> 3:37:01.080\n Yeah, let's say it's 33 steps from the,\n\n3:37:01.080 --> 3:37:03.720\n the longest path in the graph is 33 steps.\n\n3:37:03.720 --> 3:37:07.400\n So that's the, there's a 33 step path you have to follow\n\n3:37:07.400 --> 3:37:10.920\n to go from the axioms, according to Euclid's proofs,\n\n3:37:10.920 --> 3:37:13.560\n to the statement there are five platonic solids.\n\n3:37:13.560 --> 3:37:17.480\n So, okay, so then the question is,\n\n3:37:17.480 --> 3:37:22.360\n in, what does it mean if you have this map?\n\n3:37:22.360 --> 3:37:26.400\n Okay, so in a sense, this metamathematical space\n\n3:37:26.400 --> 3:37:29.200\n is the infrastructural space of all possible theorems\n\n3:37:29.200 --> 3:37:31.560\n that you could prove in mathematics.\n\n3:37:31.560 --> 3:37:34.360\n That's the geometry of metamathematics.\n\n3:37:34.360 --> 3:37:37.120\n There's also the geography of mathematics.\n\n3:37:37.120 --> 3:37:40.760\n That is, where did people choose to live in space?\n\n3:37:40.760 --> 3:37:42.240\n And that's what, for example,\n\n3:37:42.240 --> 3:37:44.320\n exploring the sort of empirical metamathematics\n\n3:37:44.320 --> 3:37:45.160\n that Euclid is doing.\n\n3:37:45.160 --> 3:37:48.360\n You could put each individual, like, human mathematician,\n\n3:37:48.360 --> 3:37:49.840\n you can embed them into that space.\n\n3:37:49.840 --> 3:37:51.000\n I mean, they kind of live.\n\n3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:52.320\n They represent a path in the space.\n\n3:37:52.320 --> 3:37:53.160\n The little path.\n\n3:37:53.160 --> 3:37:54.000\n The things they do.\n\n3:37:54.000 --> 3:37:54.820\n Maybe a set of paths.\n\n3:37:54.820 --> 3:37:55.660\n Right.\n\n3:37:55.660 --> 3:37:58.480\n So like a set of axioms that are chosen.\n\n3:37:58.480 --> 3:37:59.400\n Right, so for example,\n\n3:37:59.400 --> 3:38:01.960\n here's an example of a thing that I realized.\n\n3:38:01.960 --> 3:38:03.920\n So one of the surprising things about,\n\n3:38:03.920 --> 3:38:06.040\n well, there are two surprising facts about math.\n\n3:38:06.040 --> 3:38:07.520\n One is that it's hard,\n\n3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:10.200\n and the other is that it's doable, okay?\n\n3:38:10.200 --> 3:38:12.640\n So first question is, why is math hard?\n\n3:38:12.640 --> 3:38:13.800\n You know, you've got these axioms.\n\n3:38:13.800 --> 3:38:14.980\n They're very small.\n\n3:38:14.980 --> 3:38:17.640\n Why can't you just solve every problem in math easily?\n\n3:38:17.640 --> 3:38:19.120\n Yeah, it's just logic.\n\n3:38:19.120 --> 3:38:19.960\n Right, yeah.\n\n3:38:19.960 --> 3:38:22.560\n Well, logic happens to be a particular special case\n\n3:38:22.560 --> 3:38:25.280\n that does have certain simplicity to it.\n\n3:38:25.280 --> 3:38:27.580\n But general mathematics, even arithmetic,\n\n3:38:27.580 --> 3:38:30.360\n already doesn't have the simplicity that logic has.\n\n3:38:30.360 --> 3:38:31.720\n So why is it hard?\n\n3:38:31.720 --> 3:38:33.840\n Because of computational irreducibility.\n\n3:38:33.840 --> 3:38:34.680\n Right.\n\n3:38:35.560 --> 3:38:38.900\n Because what happens is, to know what's true,\n\n3:38:38.900 --> 3:38:40.720\n and this is this whole story about the path\n\n3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:43.000\n you have to follow and how long is the path,\n\n3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:44.520\n and G\u00f6del's theorem is the statement\n\n3:38:44.520 --> 3:38:47.680\n that the path is not a bounded length,\n\n3:38:47.680 --> 3:38:50.440\n but the fact that the path is not always compressible\n\n3:38:50.440 --> 3:38:54.480\n to something tiny is a story of computational irreducibility.\n\n3:38:54.480 --> 3:38:56.800\n So that's why math is hard.\n\n3:38:56.800 --> 3:38:59.520\n Now, the next question is, why is math doable?\n\n3:38:59.520 --> 3:39:02.260\n Because it might be the case that most things you care about\n\n3:39:02.260 --> 3:39:04.200\n don't have finite length paths.\n\n3:39:04.200 --> 3:39:06.720\n Most things you care about might be things\n\n3:39:06.720 --> 3:39:10.160\n where you get lost in the sea of computational irreducibility\n\n3:39:10.160 --> 3:39:12.520\n and worse, undecidability.\n\n3:39:12.520 --> 3:39:14.760\n That is, there's just no finite length path\n\n3:39:14.760 --> 3:39:15.820\n that gets you there.\n\n3:39:17.000 --> 3:39:19.040\n Why is mathematics doable?\n\n3:39:19.040 --> 3:39:22.200\n G\u00f6del proved his incompleteness theorem in 1931.\n\n3:39:22.200 --> 3:39:25.240\n Most working mathematicians don't really care about it.\n\n3:39:25.240 --> 3:39:27.240\n They just go ahead and do mathematics,\n\n3:39:27.240 --> 3:39:29.720\n even though it could be that the questions they're asking\n\n3:39:29.720 --> 3:39:31.040\n are undecidable.\n\n3:39:31.040 --> 3:39:32.880\n It could have been that Fermat's last theorem\n\n3:39:32.880 --> 3:39:33.720\n is undecidable.\n\n3:39:33.720 --> 3:39:35.120\n It turned out it had a proof.\n\n3:39:35.120 --> 3:39:36.960\n It's a long, complicated proof.\n\n3:39:36.960 --> 3:39:40.200\n The twin prime conjecture might be undecidable.\n\n3:39:40.200 --> 3:39:43.020\n The Riemann hypothesis might be undecidable.\n\n3:39:43.020 --> 3:39:45.920\n These things might be, the axioms of mathematics\n\n3:39:45.920 --> 3:39:49.020\n might not be strong enough to reach those statements.\n\n3:39:49.020 --> 3:39:51.400\n It might be the case that depending on what axioms\n\n3:39:51.400 --> 3:39:53.440\n you choose, you can either say that's true\n\n3:39:53.440 --> 3:39:54.760\n or that's not true.\n\n3:39:54.760 --> 3:39:55.600\n So...\n\n3:39:55.600 --> 3:39:57.640\n And by the way, from Fermat's last theorem,\n\n3:39:57.640 --> 3:39:59.420\n there could be a shorter path.\n\n3:39:59.420 --> 3:40:00.360\n Absolutely.\n\n3:40:00.360 --> 3:40:03.720\n Yeah, so the notion of geodesics in metamathematical space\n\n3:40:03.720 --> 3:40:07.260\n is the notion of shortest proofs in metamathematical space.\n\n3:40:07.260 --> 3:40:09.400\n And that's a, you know, human mathematicians\n\n3:40:09.400 --> 3:40:11.400\n do not find shortest paths,\n\n3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:13.940\n nor do automated theorem provers.\n\n3:40:13.940 --> 3:40:16.840\n But the fact, and by the way, the, I mean,\n\n3:40:16.840 --> 3:40:18.760\n this stuff is so bizarrely connected.\n\n3:40:18.760 --> 3:40:21.640\n I mean, if you're into automated theorem proving,\n\n3:40:21.640 --> 3:40:23.500\n there are these so called critical pair lemmas\n\n3:40:23.500 --> 3:40:24.900\n and automated theorem proving.\n\n3:40:24.900 --> 3:40:28.600\n Those are precisely the branch pairs in our,\n\n3:40:28.600 --> 3:40:30.600\n that in multiway graphs.\n\n3:40:30.600 --> 3:40:32.920\n Let me just finish on the why mathematics is doable.\n\n3:40:32.920 --> 3:40:34.120\n Oh yes, the second part.\n\n3:40:34.120 --> 3:40:36.680\n So you know why it's hard, why is it doable?\n\n3:40:36.680 --> 3:40:38.120\n Right, why do we not just get lost\n\n3:40:38.120 --> 3:40:39.520\n in undecidability all the time?\n\n3:40:39.520 --> 3:40:40.560\n Yeah.\n\n3:40:40.560 --> 3:40:43.160\n So, and here's another fact,\n\n3:40:43.160 --> 3:40:45.400\n is in doing computer experiments\n\n3:40:45.400 --> 3:40:47.020\n and doing experimental mathematics,\n\n3:40:47.020 --> 3:40:49.020\n you do get lost in that way.\n\n3:40:49.020 --> 3:40:53.860\n When you just say, I'm picking a random integer equation.\n\n3:40:53.860 --> 3:40:56.200\n How do I, does it have a solution or not?\n\n3:40:56.200 --> 3:40:57.400\n And you just pick it at random\n\n3:40:57.400 --> 3:41:00.900\n without any human sort of path getting there.\n\n3:41:00.900 --> 3:41:03.280\n Often, it's really, really hard.\n\n3:41:03.280 --> 3:41:04.760\n It's really hard to answer those questions.\n\n3:41:04.760 --> 3:41:07.840\n We just pick them at random from the space of possibilities.\n\n3:41:07.840 --> 3:41:10.720\n But what I think is happening is,\n\n3:41:10.720 --> 3:41:12.460\n and that's a case where you just fell off\n\n3:41:12.460 --> 3:41:15.560\n into this ocean of sort of irreducibility and so on.\n\n3:41:15.560 --> 3:41:18.220\n What's happening is human mathematics\n\n3:41:18.220 --> 3:41:19.920\n is a story of building a path.\n\n3:41:19.920 --> 3:41:23.220\n You started off, you're always building out\n\n3:41:23.220 --> 3:41:25.720\n on this path where you are proving things.\n\n3:41:25.720 --> 3:41:28.120\n You've got this proof trajectory\n\n3:41:28.120 --> 3:41:30.320\n and you're basically, the human mathematics\n\n3:41:30.320 --> 3:41:34.160\n is the sort of the exploration of the world\n\n3:41:34.160 --> 3:41:36.760\n along this proof trajectory, so to speak.\n\n3:41:36.760 --> 3:41:41.760\n You're not just parachuting in from anywhere.\n\n3:41:42.840 --> 3:41:44.840\n You're following Lewis and Clark or whatever.\n\n3:41:44.840 --> 3:41:48.160\n You're actually going, doing the path.\n\n3:41:48.160 --> 3:41:52.080\n And the fact that you are constrained to go along that path\n\n3:41:52.080 --> 3:41:53.760\n is the reason you don't end up with,\n\n3:41:53.760 --> 3:41:55.840\n every so often you'll see a little piece of undecidability\n\n3:41:55.840 --> 3:41:57.980\n and you'll avoid that part of the path.\n\n3:41:57.980 --> 3:42:00.960\n But that's basically the story of why human mathematics\n\n3:42:00.960 --> 3:42:02.640\n has seemed to be doable.\n\n3:42:02.640 --> 3:42:05.200\n It's a story of exploring these paths\n\n3:42:05.200 --> 3:42:07.240\n that are by their nature,\n\n3:42:07.240 --> 3:42:10.480\n they have been constructed to be paths that can be followed.\n\n3:42:10.480 --> 3:42:12.260\n And so you can follow them further.\n\n3:42:12.260 --> 3:42:14.920\n Now, why is this relevant to anything?\n\n3:42:14.920 --> 3:42:19.480\n So, okay, so here's my belief.\n\n3:42:19.480 --> 3:42:22.640\n The fact that human mathematics works that way\n\n3:42:22.640 --> 3:42:26.080\n is I think there's some sort of connections\n\n3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:29.720\n between the way that observers work in physics\n\n3:42:29.720 --> 3:42:32.980\n and the way that the axiom systems of mathematics are set up\n\n3:42:32.980 --> 3:42:36.360\n to make mathematics be doable in that kind of way.\n\n3:42:36.360 --> 3:42:38.880\n And so, in other words, in particular,\n\n3:42:38.880 --> 3:42:41.720\n I think there is an analog of causal invariance,\n\n3:42:41.720 --> 3:42:44.800\n which I think is, and this is again,\n\n3:42:44.800 --> 3:42:46.620\n it's sort of the upper reaches of mathematics\n\n3:42:46.620 --> 3:42:50.680\n and stuff that it's a thing,\n\n3:42:50.680 --> 3:42:52.900\n there's this thing called homotopy type theory,\n\n3:42:52.900 --> 3:42:56.120\n which is an abstract, it's came out of category theory,\n\n3:42:56.120 --> 3:42:58.380\n and it's sort of an abstraction of mathematics.\n\n3:42:58.380 --> 3:43:00.360\n Mathematics itself is an abstraction,\n\n3:43:00.360 --> 3:43:03.980\n but it's an abstraction of the abstraction of mathematics.\n\n3:43:03.980 --> 3:43:06.620\n And there is the thing called the univalence axiom,\n\n3:43:06.620 --> 3:43:11.620\n which is a sort of a key axiom in that set of ideas.\n\n3:43:12.220 --> 3:43:14.200\n And I'm pretty sure the univalence axiom\n\n3:43:14.200 --> 3:43:16.220\n is equivalent to causal invariance.\n\n3:43:16.220 --> 3:43:18.120\n What was the term you used again?\n\n3:43:18.120 --> 3:43:19.000\n Univalence.\n\n3:43:19.000 --> 3:43:21.560\n Is that something for somebody like me accessible?\n\n3:43:21.560 --> 3:43:23.200\n Or is this?\n\n3:43:23.200 --> 3:43:25.560\n There's a statement of it that's fairly accessible.\n\n3:43:25.560 --> 3:43:27.080\n I mean, the statement of it is,\n\n3:43:29.680 --> 3:43:32.760\n basically it says things which are equivalent\n\n3:43:32.760 --> 3:43:34.620\n can be considered to be identical.\n\n3:43:35.520 --> 3:43:38.160\n In which space?\n\n3:43:38.160 --> 3:43:40.720\n Yeah, it's in higher category.\n\n3:43:40.720 --> 3:43:41.720\n In category.\n\n3:43:41.720 --> 3:43:43.880\n Okay, so it's a, but I mean,\n\n3:43:43.880 --> 3:43:46.160\n the thing just to give a sketch of how that works.\n\n3:43:46.160 --> 3:43:49.680\n So category theory is an attempt to idealize,\n\n3:43:49.680 --> 3:43:52.060\n it's an attempt to sort of have a formal theory\n\n3:43:52.060 --> 3:43:54.400\n of mathematics that is at a sort of higher level\n\n3:43:54.400 --> 3:43:55.600\n than mathematics.\n\n3:43:55.600 --> 3:43:59.560\n It's where you just think about these mathematical objects\n\n3:43:59.560 --> 3:44:03.720\n and these categories of objects and these morphisms,\n\n3:44:03.720 --> 3:44:05.600\n these connections between categories.\n\n3:44:05.600 --> 3:44:08.640\n Okay, so it turns out the morphisms and categories,\n\n3:44:08.640 --> 3:44:10.840\n at least weak categories,\n\n3:44:10.840 --> 3:44:14.820\n are very much like the paths in our hypergraphs and things.\n\n3:44:14.820 --> 3:44:18.480\n And it turns out, again, this is where it all gets crazy.\n\n3:44:18.480 --> 3:44:20.800\n I mean, the fact that these things are connected\n\n3:44:20.800 --> 3:44:22.000\n is just bizarre.\n\n3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:27.000\n So category theory, our causal graphs\n\n3:44:27.080 --> 3:44:29.940\n are like second order category theory.\n\n3:44:29.940 --> 3:44:32.640\n And it turns out you can take the limits\n\n3:44:32.640 --> 3:44:34.160\n of infinite order category theory.\n\n3:44:34.160 --> 3:44:36.480\n So just give roughly the idea.\n\n3:44:36.480 --> 3:44:39.120\n This is a roughly explainable idea.\n\n3:44:39.120 --> 3:44:43.400\n So a mathematical proof will be a path\n\n3:44:43.400 --> 3:44:45.920\n that says you can get from this thing to this other thing.\n\n3:44:45.920 --> 3:44:47.480\n And here's the path that you get from this thing\n\n3:44:47.480 --> 3:44:48.720\n to this other thing.\n\n3:44:48.720 --> 3:44:51.160\n But in general, there may be many paths,\n\n3:44:51.160 --> 3:44:53.960\n many proofs that get you many different paths\n\n3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:55.800\n that all successfully go from this thing\n\n3:44:55.800 --> 3:44:57.700\n to this other thing, okay?\n\n3:44:57.700 --> 3:45:00.400\n Now you can define a higher order proof,\n\n3:45:00.400 --> 3:45:03.840\n which is a proof of the equivalence of those proofs.\n\n3:45:03.840 --> 3:45:05.440\n Okay, so you're saying there's a...\n\n3:45:05.440 --> 3:45:07.120\n A path between those proofs essentially.\n\n3:45:07.120 --> 3:45:09.800\n Yes, a path between the paths, okay?\n\n3:45:09.800 --> 3:45:10.960\n And so you do that.\n\n3:45:10.960 --> 3:45:12.300\n That's the sort of second order thing.\n\n3:45:12.300 --> 3:45:16.120\n That path between the paths is essentially related\n\n3:45:16.120 --> 3:45:18.240\n to our causal graphs.\n\n3:45:18.240 --> 3:45:19.560\n Then you can take the limit.\n\n3:45:19.560 --> 3:45:20.400\n Wow, okay.\n\n3:45:20.400 --> 3:45:23.040\n The path between path, between path, between path.\n\n3:45:23.040 --> 3:45:24.640\n The infinite limit.\n\n3:45:24.640 --> 3:45:26.340\n That infinite limit turns out to be\n\n3:45:26.340 --> 3:45:28.800\n our Rulial Multiway System.\n\n3:45:28.800 --> 3:45:31.600\n Yeah, the Rulial Multiway System,\n\n3:45:31.600 --> 3:45:33.860\n that's a fascinating, both in the physics world\n\n3:45:33.860 --> 3:45:36.920\n and as you're saying now, that's fast.\n\n3:45:36.920 --> 3:45:39.120\n I'm not sure I've loaded it in completely, but...\n\n3:45:39.120 --> 3:45:40.320\n Well, I'm not sure I have either.\n\n3:45:40.320 --> 3:45:42.560\n And it may be one of these things where,\n\n3:45:42.560 --> 3:45:45.160\n in another five years or something, it's like,\n\n3:45:45.160 --> 3:45:47.120\n it was obvious, but I didn't see it.\n\n3:45:47.120 --> 3:45:49.360\n No, but the thing which is sort of interesting to me\n\n3:45:49.360 --> 3:45:53.080\n is that there's sort of an upper reach of mathematics,\n\n3:45:53.080 --> 3:45:54.840\n of the abstraction of mathematics.\n\n3:45:55.880 --> 3:45:59.000\n This thing, there's this mathematician called Grothendieck\n\n3:45:59.000 --> 3:46:00.680\n who's generally viewed as being sort of one\n\n3:46:00.680 --> 3:46:02.320\n of the most abstract,\n\n3:46:02.320 --> 3:46:04.800\n sort of creator of the most abstract mathematics\n\n3:46:04.800 --> 3:46:07.900\n of 1970s ish timeframe.\n\n3:46:09.360 --> 3:46:11.560\n And one of the things that he constructed was this thing\n\n3:46:11.560 --> 3:46:13.280\n he called the Infinity Grupoid.\n\n3:46:13.280 --> 3:46:15.820\n And he has this sort of hypothesis\n\n3:46:15.820 --> 3:46:18.380\n about the inevitable appearance of geometry\n\n3:46:18.380 --> 3:46:22.420\n from essentially logic in the structure of this thing.\n\n3:46:22.420 --> 3:46:24.660\n Well, it turns out this Rulial Multiway System\n\n3:46:24.660 --> 3:46:26.620\n is the Infinity Grupoid.\n\n3:46:26.620 --> 3:46:29.700\n So it's this limiting object.\n\n3:46:29.700 --> 3:46:33.560\n And this is an instance of that limiting object.\n\n3:46:33.560 --> 3:46:35.460\n So what to me is, I mean, again,\n\n3:46:35.460 --> 3:46:37.980\n I've been always afraid of this kind of mathematics\n\n3:46:37.980 --> 3:46:42.260\n because it seemed incomprehensibly abstract to me.\n\n3:46:42.260 --> 3:46:45.620\n But what I'm sort of excited about with this\n\n3:46:45.620 --> 3:46:49.540\n is that we've sort of concretified the way\n\n3:46:49.540 --> 3:46:51.860\n that you can reach this kind of mathematics,\n\n3:46:51.860 --> 3:46:55.260\n which makes it, well, both seem more relevant\n\n3:46:55.260 --> 3:46:58.820\n and also the fact that I don't yet know exactly\n\n3:46:58.820 --> 3:47:01.120\n what mileage we're gonna get from using\n\n3:47:01.120 --> 3:47:03.340\n the sort of the apparatus that's been built\n\n3:47:03.340 --> 3:47:06.500\n in those areas of mathematics to analyze what we're doing.\n\n3:47:06.500 --> 3:47:07.340\n But the thing that's.\n\n3:47:07.340 --> 3:47:08.180\n So both ways.\n\n3:47:08.180 --> 3:47:10.020\n So using mathematics to understand what you're doing\n\n3:47:10.020 --> 3:47:12.340\n and using what you're doing computationally\n\n3:47:12.340 --> 3:47:13.180\n to understand that.\n\n3:47:13.180 --> 3:47:14.020\n Right, so for example,\n\n3:47:14.020 --> 3:47:17.860\n the understanding of metamathematical space,\n\n3:47:17.860 --> 3:47:19.860\n one of the reasons I really want to do that\n\n3:47:19.860 --> 3:47:22.620\n is because I want to understand quantum mechanics better.\n\n3:47:22.620 --> 3:47:25.980\n And that, what you see,\n\n3:47:25.980 --> 3:47:30.260\n we live that kind of the multiway graph of mathematics\n\n3:47:30.260 --> 3:47:32.540\n because we actually know this is a theorem we've heard of.\n\n3:47:32.540 --> 3:47:34.020\n This is another one we've heard of.\n\n3:47:34.020 --> 3:47:36.900\n We can actually say these are actual things in the world\n\n3:47:36.900 --> 3:47:38.480\n that we relate to,\n\n3:47:38.480 --> 3:47:43.100\n which we can't really do as readily for the physics case.\n\n3:47:43.100 --> 3:47:45.180\n And so it's kind of a way to help my intuition.\n\n3:47:45.180 --> 3:47:47.820\n It's also, there are bizarre things\n\n3:47:47.820 --> 3:47:50.020\n like what's the analog of Einstein's equations\n\n3:47:50.020 --> 3:47:51.880\n in metamathematical space?\n\n3:47:51.880 --> 3:47:53.980\n What's the analog of a black hole?\n\n3:47:53.980 --> 3:47:57.660\n It turns out it looks like not completely sure yet,\n\n3:47:57.660 --> 3:48:00.180\n but there's this notion of nonconstructive proofs\n\n3:48:00.180 --> 3:48:01.500\n in mathematics.\n\n3:48:01.500 --> 3:48:03.540\n And I think those relate to,\n\n3:48:03.540 --> 3:48:07.780\n well, actually they relate to things\n\n3:48:07.780 --> 3:48:10.420\n related to event horizons.\n\n3:48:10.420 --> 3:48:13.500\n So the fact that you can take ideas from physics\n\n3:48:13.500 --> 3:48:14.460\n like event horizons.\n\n3:48:14.460 --> 3:48:17.100\n And map them into the same kind of space, metamath.\n\n3:48:17.100 --> 3:48:17.940\n It's really.\n\n3:48:17.940 --> 3:48:19.460\n So do you think there'll be,\n\n3:48:19.460 --> 3:48:22.140\n do you think you might stumble upon\n\n3:48:22.140 --> 3:48:25.860\n some breakthrough ideas in theorem proving?\n\n3:48:25.860 --> 3:48:28.700\n Like for, from the other direction?\n\n3:48:28.700 --> 3:48:29.540\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n3:48:29.540 --> 3:48:32.180\n No, I mean, what's really nice is that we are using,\n\n3:48:32.180 --> 3:48:35.640\n so this absolutely directly maps to theorem proving.\n\n3:48:35.640 --> 3:48:37.240\n So pods and multiway graphs,\n\n3:48:37.240 --> 3:48:38.540\n that's what a theorem prover is trying to do.\n\n3:48:38.540 --> 3:48:40.780\n But I also mean like automated theorem.\n\n3:48:40.780 --> 3:48:41.620\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n3:48:41.620 --> 3:48:42.440\n That's what, right.\n\n3:48:42.440 --> 3:48:45.180\n So the finding of pods, the finding of shortest pods\n\n3:48:45.180 --> 3:48:46.840\n or finding of pods at all\n\n3:48:46.840 --> 3:48:48.780\n is what automated theorem provers do.\n\n3:48:48.780 --> 3:48:51.020\n And actually what we've been doing.\n\n3:48:51.020 --> 3:48:53.760\n So we've actually been using automated theorem proving\n\n3:48:53.760 --> 3:48:56.340\n both in the physics project to prove things\n\n3:48:56.340 --> 3:49:00.540\n and using that as a way to understand multiway graphs.\n\n3:49:00.540 --> 3:49:04.080\n And because what an automated theorem prover is doing\n\n3:49:04.080 --> 3:49:07.380\n is it's trying to find a path through a multiway graph\n\n3:49:07.380 --> 3:49:09.300\n and its critical pair lemmas\n\n3:49:09.300 --> 3:49:12.960\n are precisely little stubs of branch pairs\n\n3:49:12.960 --> 3:49:15.080\n going off into branchial space.\n\n3:49:15.080 --> 3:49:16.860\n And that's, I mean, it's really weird.\n\n3:49:16.860 --> 3:49:19.100\n You know, we have these visualizations in Wolfram language\n\n3:49:19.100 --> 3:49:24.100\n of proof graphs from our automated theorem proving system.\n\n3:49:24.180 --> 3:49:25.660\n And they look reminiscent of.\n\n3:49:25.660 --> 3:49:26.860\n Well, it's just bizarre\n\n3:49:26.860 --> 3:49:28.820\n because we made these up a few years ago\n\n3:49:28.820 --> 3:49:30.740\n and they have these little triangle things\n\n3:49:30.740 --> 3:49:33.020\n and they are, we didn't quite get it right.\n\n3:49:33.020 --> 3:49:35.100\n We didn't quite get the analogy perfectly right,\n\n3:49:35.100 --> 3:49:36.220\n but it's very close.\n\n3:49:36.220 --> 3:49:37.460\n You know, just to say,\n\n3:49:37.460 --> 3:49:39.940\n in terms of how these things are connected.\n\n3:49:39.940 --> 3:49:41.520\n So there's another bizarre connection\n\n3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:46.160\n that I have to mention because which is,\n\n3:49:46.160 --> 3:49:47.940\n which again, we don't fully know,\n\n3:49:47.940 --> 3:49:51.140\n but it's a connection to something else\n\n3:49:51.140 --> 3:49:52.660\n you might not have thought was in the slightest\n\n3:49:52.660 --> 3:49:56.840\n but connected, which is distributed blockchain like things.\n\n3:49:56.840 --> 3:49:58.140\n Now you might figure out that that's,\n\n3:49:58.140 --> 3:49:59.900\n you would figure out that that's connected\n\n3:49:59.900 --> 3:50:02.860\n because it's a story of distributed computing.\n\n3:50:02.860 --> 3:50:04.860\n And the issue, you know, with the blockchain,\n\n3:50:04.860 --> 3:50:07.580\n you're saying there's going to be this one ledger\n\n3:50:07.580 --> 3:50:11.700\n that globally says, this is what happened in the world.\n\n3:50:11.700 --> 3:50:14.000\n But that's a bad deal.\n\n3:50:14.000 --> 3:50:15.640\n If you've got all these different transactions\n\n3:50:15.640 --> 3:50:17.300\n that are happening and you know,\n\n3:50:17.300 --> 3:50:20.660\n this transaction in country A\n\n3:50:20.660 --> 3:50:23.380\n doesn't have to be reconciled with the transaction\n\n3:50:23.380 --> 3:50:25.380\n in country B, at least not for a while.\n\n3:50:26.220 --> 3:50:29.380\n And that story is just like what happens\n\n3:50:29.380 --> 3:50:31.000\n with our causal graphs.\n\n3:50:31.000 --> 3:50:33.220\n That whole reconciliation thing is just like\n\n3:50:33.220 --> 3:50:35.740\n what happens with light cones and all this kind of thing.\n\n3:50:35.740 --> 3:50:37.420\n That's where the causal awareness comes into play.\n\n3:50:37.420 --> 3:50:39.180\n I mean, that's, you know,\n\n3:50:39.180 --> 3:50:41.380\n most of your conversations are about physics,\n\n3:50:41.380 --> 3:50:46.000\n but it's kind of funny that this probably\n\n3:50:46.000 --> 3:50:49.340\n and possibly might have even bigger impact\n\n3:50:49.340 --> 3:50:53.980\n and revolutionary ideas and totally other disciplines.\n\n3:50:53.980 --> 3:50:55.400\n Right, well, you see, yeah, right.\n\n3:50:55.400 --> 3:50:57.640\n So the question is, why is that happening, right?\n\n3:50:57.640 --> 3:50:59.140\n And the reason it's happening,\n\n3:50:59.140 --> 3:51:00.700\n I've thought about this obviously,\n\n3:51:00.700 --> 3:51:03.300\n because I like to think about these meta questions of,\n\n3:51:03.300 --> 3:51:06.380\n you know, what's happening is this model that we have\n\n3:51:06.380 --> 3:51:08.740\n is an incredibly minimal model.\n\n3:51:08.740 --> 3:51:11.360\n And once you have an incredibly minimal model,\n\n3:51:11.360 --> 3:51:13.620\n and this happened with cellular automata as well,\n\n3:51:13.620 --> 3:51:16.040\n cellular automata are an incredibly minimal model.\n\n3:51:16.040 --> 3:51:19.100\n And so it's inevitable that it gets you,\n\n3:51:19.100 --> 3:51:20.600\n it's sort of an upstream thing\n\n3:51:20.600 --> 3:51:22.720\n that gets used in lots of different places.\n\n3:51:22.720 --> 3:51:25.280\n And it's like, you know, the fact that it gets used,\n\n3:51:25.280 --> 3:51:27.380\n you know, cellular automata is sort of a minimal model\n\n3:51:27.380 --> 3:51:29.140\n of let's say road traffic flow or something.\n\n3:51:29.140 --> 3:51:31.340\n And they're also a minimal model of something in,\n\n3:51:31.340 --> 3:51:32.180\n you know, chemistry,\n\n3:51:32.180 --> 3:51:33.560\n and they're also a minimal model of something\n\n3:51:33.560 --> 3:51:35.860\n in epidemiology, right?\n\n3:51:35.860 --> 3:51:38.140\n It's because they're such a simple model that they can,\n\n3:51:38.140 --> 3:51:40.300\n that they apply to all these different things.\n\n3:51:40.300 --> 3:51:43.060\n Similarly, this model that we have with the physics project\n\n3:51:43.060 --> 3:51:47.300\n is another, cellular automata are a minimal model\n\n3:51:47.300 --> 3:51:50.580\n of parallel, of basically of parallel computation\n\n3:51:50.580 --> 3:51:52.840\n where you've defined space and time.\n\n3:51:52.840 --> 3:51:54.820\n These models are minimal models\n\n3:51:54.820 --> 3:51:57.180\n where you have not defined space and time.\n\n3:51:57.180 --> 3:52:00.340\n And they have been very hard to understand in the past,\n\n3:52:00.340 --> 3:52:01.980\n but the, I think the,\n\n3:52:01.980 --> 3:52:04.500\n perhaps the most important breakthrough there\n\n3:52:04.500 --> 3:52:07.440\n is the realization that these are models of physics.\n\n3:52:07.440 --> 3:52:09.180\n And therefore that you can use everything\n\n3:52:09.180 --> 3:52:11.140\n that's been developed in physics\n\n3:52:11.140 --> 3:52:13.880\n to get intuition about how things like that work.\n\n3:52:13.880 --> 3:52:17.500\n And that's why you can potentially use ideas from physics\n\n3:52:17.500 --> 3:52:20.140\n to get intuition about how to do parallel computing.\n\n3:52:20.140 --> 3:52:24.940\n And because the underlying model is the same.\n\n3:52:24.940 --> 3:52:27.060\n But we have all of this achievement in physics.\n\n3:52:27.060 --> 3:52:28.500\n I mean, you know, you might say,\n\n3:52:28.500 --> 3:52:30.160\n oh, you've come up with the fundamental theory of physics\n\n3:52:30.160 --> 3:52:32.500\n that throws out what people have done in physics before.\n\n3:52:32.500 --> 3:52:35.540\n Well, it doesn't, but also the real power\n\n3:52:35.540 --> 3:52:37.940\n is to use what's been done before in physics\n\n3:52:37.940 --> 3:52:39.620\n to apply it in these other places.\n\n3:52:39.620 --> 3:52:41.500\n Yes, absolutely.\n\n3:52:41.500 --> 3:52:43.020\n This kind of brings up,\n\n3:52:43.020 --> 3:52:47.900\n I know you probably don't particularly love commenting\n\n3:52:47.900 --> 3:52:48.820\n on the work of others,\n\n3:52:48.820 --> 3:52:51.260\n but let me bring up a couple of personalities\n\n3:52:51.260 --> 3:52:53.660\n just because it's fun and people are curious about it.\n\n3:52:53.660 --> 3:52:58.660\n So there's Sabine Hassenfelder.\n\n3:52:58.700 --> 3:53:00.460\n I don't know if you're familiar with her.\n\n3:53:00.460 --> 3:53:04.920\n She wrote this book that I need to read,\n\n3:53:04.920 --> 3:53:06.980\n but I forget what the title is,\n\n3:53:06.980 --> 3:53:10.480\n but it's Beauty Leads Us Astray in Physics\n\n3:53:10.480 --> 3:53:12.420\n is a subtitle or something like that.\n\n3:53:12.420 --> 3:53:15.100\n Which so much about what we're talking about now,\n\n3:53:15.100 --> 3:53:16.540\n like this simplification,\n\n3:53:17.860 --> 3:53:20.440\n to us humans seems to be beautiful.\n\n3:53:20.440 --> 3:53:23.540\n Like there's a certain intuition with physicists,\n\n3:53:23.540 --> 3:53:26.700\n with people that a simple theory,\n\n3:53:26.700 --> 3:53:28.060\n like this reducibility,\n\n3:53:28.060 --> 3:53:30.580\n pockets of reducibility is the ultimate goal.\n\n3:53:30.580 --> 3:53:34.780\n And I think what she tries to argue is no,\n\n3:53:34.780 --> 3:53:37.740\n we just need to come up with theories\n\n3:53:37.740 --> 3:53:40.620\n that are just really good at predicting physical phenomena.\n\n3:53:40.620 --> 3:53:44.360\n It's okay to have a bunch of disparate theories\n\n3:53:44.360 --> 3:53:48.580\n as opposed to trying to chase this beautiful theory\n\n3:53:48.580 --> 3:53:51.140\n of everything is the ultimate beautiful theory,\n\n3:53:51.140 --> 3:53:52.140\n a simple one.\n\n3:53:52.140 --> 3:53:54.620\n What's your response to that?\n\n3:53:54.620 --> 3:53:56.340\n Well, so what you're quoting,\n\n3:53:56.340 --> 3:53:59.820\n I don't know the Sabine Hassenfelder's,\n\n3:53:59.820 --> 3:54:00.660\n exactly what she said,\n\n3:54:00.660 --> 3:54:03.780\n but I mean that you're quoting the title of her book.\n\n3:54:03.780 --> 3:54:04.620\n Okay.\n\n3:54:04.620 --> 3:54:07.780\n Let me respond to what you were describing,\n\n3:54:07.780 --> 3:54:09.620\n which may or may not have nothing to do with\n\n3:54:09.620 --> 3:54:14.620\n what Sabine Hassenfelder says or thinks.\n\n3:54:14.660 --> 3:54:15.500\n Sorry, Sabine.\n\n3:54:16.460 --> 3:54:17.300\n Right.\n\n3:54:17.300 --> 3:54:18.420\n Sorry for misquoting.\n\n3:54:18.420 --> 3:54:21.300\n But I mean, the question is,\n\n3:54:23.300 --> 3:54:26.540\n is beauty a guide to whether something is correct?\n\n3:54:26.540 --> 3:54:29.180\n Which is kind of also the story of Occam's razor.\n\n3:54:29.180 --> 3:54:32.140\n If you've got a bunch of different explanations of things,\n\n3:54:32.140 --> 3:54:34.500\n is the thing that is the simplest explanation\n\n3:54:34.500 --> 3:54:36.580\n likely to be the correct explanation?\n\n3:54:36.580 --> 3:54:38.100\n And there are situations where that's true\n\n3:54:38.100 --> 3:54:39.940\n and there are situations where it isn't true.\n\n3:54:39.940 --> 3:54:41.900\n Sometimes in human systems, it is true\n\n3:54:41.900 --> 3:54:43.140\n because people have kind of,\n\n3:54:43.140 --> 3:54:45.220\n in evolutionary systems, sometimes it's true\n\n3:54:45.220 --> 3:54:46.780\n because it's sort of been kicked\n\n3:54:46.780 --> 3:54:49.340\n to the point where it's minimized.\n\n3:54:49.340 --> 3:54:53.580\n But in physics, does Occam's razor work?\n\n3:54:53.580 --> 3:54:57.420\n Is there a simple, quotes, beautiful explanation for things\n\n3:54:57.420 --> 3:54:58.740\n or is it a big mess?\n\n3:54:59.780 --> 3:55:01.940\n We don't intrinsically know.\n\n3:55:01.940 --> 3:55:03.660\n I think that the, I wouldn't,\n\n3:55:03.660 --> 3:55:07.180\n before I worked on the project in recent times,\n\n3:55:07.180 --> 3:55:08.220\n I would have said,\n\n3:55:08.220 --> 3:55:09.900\n we do not know how complicated\n\n3:55:09.900 --> 3:55:12.100\n the rule for the universe will be.\n\n3:55:12.100 --> 3:55:15.940\n And I would have said, the one thing we know,\n\n3:55:15.940 --> 3:55:17.780\n which is a fundamental fact about science,\n\n3:55:17.780 --> 3:55:19.740\n that's the thing that makes science possible,\n\n3:55:19.740 --> 3:55:21.860\n is that there is order in the universe.\n\n3:55:21.860 --> 3:55:24.860\n I mean, early theologians would have used that\n\n3:55:24.860 --> 3:55:27.140\n as an argument for the existence of God\n\n3:55:27.140 --> 3:55:29.420\n because it's like, why is there order in the universe?\n\n3:55:29.420 --> 3:55:31.500\n Why doesn't every single particle in the universe\n\n3:55:31.500 --> 3:55:32.620\n just do its own thing?\n\n3:55:33.980 --> 3:55:37.180\n Something must be making there be order in the universe.\n\n3:55:37.180 --> 3:55:41.820\n We, in the sort of early theology point of view,\n\n3:55:41.820 --> 3:55:45.180\n that's the role of God is to do that, so to speak.\n\n3:55:45.180 --> 3:55:47.580\n In our, we might say,\n\n3:55:47.580 --> 3:55:50.140\n it's the role of a formal theory to do that.\n\n3:55:50.140 --> 3:55:51.060\n And then the question is,\n\n3:55:51.060 --> 3:55:53.260\n but how simple should that theory be?\n\n3:55:53.260 --> 3:55:55.180\n And should that theory be one that,\n\n3:55:57.060 --> 3:56:00.620\n where I think the point is, if it's simple,\n\n3:56:00.620 --> 3:56:03.180\n it's almost inevitably somewhat beautiful\n\n3:56:03.180 --> 3:56:06.460\n in the sense that, because all the stuff that we see\n\n3:56:06.460 --> 3:56:08.740\n has to fit into this little tiny theory.\n\n3:56:08.740 --> 3:56:11.380\n And the way it does that has to be,\n\n3:56:11.380 --> 3:56:13.300\n it depends on your notion of beauty,\n\n3:56:13.300 --> 3:56:17.940\n but I mean, for me, the sort of the surprising\n\n3:56:17.940 --> 3:56:21.980\n connectivity of it is, at least in my aesthetic,\n\n3:56:21.980 --> 3:56:25.100\n that's something that responds to my aesthetic.\n\n3:56:25.100 --> 3:56:27.780\n But the question is, I mean,\n\n3:56:27.780 --> 3:56:31.060\n you're a fascinating person in the sense that\n\n3:56:31.060 --> 3:56:34.460\n you're at once talking about computational,\n\n3:56:34.460 --> 3:56:37.940\n the fundamental computational reducibility of the universe,\n\n3:56:37.940 --> 3:56:40.380\n and on the other hand,\n\n3:56:40.380 --> 3:56:42.540\n trying to come up with a theory of everything,\n\n3:56:42.540 --> 3:56:44.860\n which simply describes the,\n\n3:56:47.740 --> 3:56:51.460\n the simple origins of that computational reducibility.\n\n3:56:51.460 --> 3:56:53.820\n I mean, both of those things are kind of,\n\n3:56:53.820 --> 3:56:56.340\n it's paralyzing to think that we can't make any sense\n\n3:56:56.340 --> 3:56:58.580\n of the universe in the general case,\n\n3:56:58.580 --> 3:57:01.060\n but it's hopeful to think like,\n\n3:57:01.060 --> 3:57:03.060\n one, we can think of a rule\n\n3:57:03.060 --> 3:57:05.980\n and that generates this whole complexity,\n\n3:57:05.980 --> 3:57:10.980\n and two, we can find pockets of reducibility\n\n3:57:10.980 --> 3:57:13.420\n that are powerful for everyday life\n\n3:57:13.420 --> 3:57:15.540\n to do different kinds of predictions.\n\n3:57:15.540 --> 3:57:19.060\n I suppose Sabine wants to find,\n\n3:57:19.060 --> 3:57:22.940\n focus on the finding of small pockets of reducibility\n\n3:57:22.940 --> 3:57:26.780\n versus the theory of everything.\n\n3:57:26.780 --> 3:57:29.300\n You know, it's a funny thing because,\n\n3:57:29.300 --> 3:57:30.780\n you know, a bunch of people have started working\n\n3:57:30.780 --> 3:57:32.980\n on this physics project,\n\n3:57:32.980 --> 3:57:35.860\n people who are physicists, basically,\n\n3:57:36.780 --> 3:57:39.820\n and it is really a fascinating sociological phenomenon\n\n3:57:39.820 --> 3:57:41.780\n because what, you know,\n\n3:57:41.780 --> 3:57:45.300\n when I was working on this before in the 1990s,\n\n3:57:45.300 --> 3:57:47.900\n you know, wrote it up, put it,\n\n3:57:47.900 --> 3:57:50.060\n it's 100 pages of this 1200 page book\n\n3:57:50.060 --> 3:57:51.300\n that I wrote, New Kind of Science,\n\n3:57:51.300 --> 3:57:54.140\n is, you know, 100 pages of that is about physics,\n\n3:57:54.140 --> 3:57:57.380\n but I saw it at that time,\n\n3:57:57.380 --> 3:57:59.620\n not as a pinnacle achievement,\n\n3:57:59.620 --> 3:58:01.820\n but rather as a use case, so to speak.\n\n3:58:01.820 --> 3:58:04.100\n I mean, my main point was this new kind of science,\n\n3:58:04.100 --> 3:58:05.940\n and it's like, you can apply it to biology,\n\n3:58:05.940 --> 3:58:08.420\n you can apply it to, you know, other kinds of physics,\n\n3:58:08.420 --> 3:58:09.900\n you can apply it to fundamental physics,\n\n3:58:09.900 --> 3:58:12.420\n it's just an application, so to speak,\n\n3:58:12.420 --> 3:58:14.740\n it's not the core thing.\n\n3:58:14.740 --> 3:58:18.100\n But then, you know, one of the things that was interesting\n\n3:58:18.100 --> 3:58:21.180\n with that book was, you know,\n\n3:58:21.180 --> 3:58:24.580\n book comes out, lots of people think it's pretty interesting\n\n3:58:24.580 --> 3:58:26.460\n and lots of people start using what it has\n\n3:58:26.460 --> 3:58:28.100\n in different kinds of fields.\n\n3:58:28.100 --> 3:58:32.500\n The one field where there was sort of a heavy pitchforking\n\n3:58:32.500 --> 3:58:35.940\n was from my friends, the fundamental physics people,\n\n3:58:35.940 --> 3:58:37.460\n which was, it's like, no,\n\n3:58:37.460 --> 3:58:38.700\n this can't possibly be right.\n\n3:58:38.700 --> 3:58:40.180\n And, you know, it's like, you know,\n\n3:58:40.180 --> 3:58:41.540\n if what you're doing is right,\n\n3:58:41.540 --> 3:58:44.220\n it'll overturn 50 years of what we've been doing.\n\n3:58:44.220 --> 3:58:46.980\n And it's like, no, it won't, was what I was saying.\n\n3:58:46.980 --> 3:58:50.820\n And it's like, but, you know, for a while,\n\n3:58:50.820 --> 3:58:54.380\n when I started, you know, I was going to go on back in 2002,\n\n3:58:54.380 --> 3:58:57.060\n well, 2004, actually, I was going to go on\n\n3:58:57.060 --> 3:58:58.500\n working on this project.\n\n3:58:58.500 --> 3:58:59.820\n And I actually stopped,\n\n3:58:59.820 --> 3:59:03.100\n partly because it's like, why am I, you know,\n\n3:59:03.100 --> 3:59:05.380\n this is like, I've been in business a long time, right?\n\n3:59:05.380 --> 3:59:08.100\n I'm building a product for a target market\n\n3:59:08.100 --> 3:59:09.700\n that doesn't want the product.\n\n3:59:09.700 --> 3:59:10.700\n And it's like.\n\n3:59:10.700 --> 3:59:13.260\n Why work, yeah, yeah, why work against the,\n\n3:59:13.260 --> 3:59:14.620\n swim against the current or whatever.\n\n3:59:14.620 --> 3:59:16.100\n Right, but you see what's happened,\n\n3:59:16.100 --> 3:59:18.060\n which is sort of interesting is that,\n\n3:59:18.060 --> 3:59:21.540\n so a couple of things happened and it was like,\n\n3:59:22.580 --> 3:59:25.700\n you know, it was like, I don't want to do this project\n\n3:59:25.700 --> 3:59:28.540\n because I can do so many other things,\n\n3:59:28.540 --> 3:59:31.820\n which I'm really interested in where, you know,\n\n3:59:31.820 --> 3:59:34.100\n people say, great, thanks for those tools.\n\n3:59:34.100 --> 3:59:36.380\n Thanks for those ideas, et cetera.\n\n3:59:36.380 --> 3:59:40.020\n Whereas, you know, if you're dealing with kind of a,\n\n3:59:40.020 --> 3:59:42.820\n you know, a sort of a structure where people are saying,\n\n3:59:42.820 --> 3:59:44.220\n no, no, we don't want this new stuff.\n\n3:59:44.220 --> 3:59:45.300\n We don't need any new stuff.\n\n3:59:45.300 --> 3:59:46.660\n We're really fine with what we're doing.\n\n3:59:46.660 --> 3:59:48.300\n Yeah, there's like literally like, I don't know,\n\n3:59:48.300 --> 3:59:51.140\n millions of people who are thankful for Wolfram Alpha.\n\n3:59:51.140 --> 3:59:53.260\n A bunch of people wrote to me, how thankful,\n\n3:59:53.260 --> 3:59:55.460\n they are a different crowd\n\n3:59:55.460 --> 3:59:57.820\n than the theoretical physics community, perhaps.\n\n3:59:57.820 --> 3:59:58.900\n Yeah, well, but you know,\n\n3:59:58.900 --> 4:00:00.260\n the theoretical physics community\n\n4:00:00.260 --> 4:00:03.180\n pretty much uniformly uses Wolfram language\n\n4:00:03.180 --> 4:00:04.380\n and Mathematica, right?\n\n4:00:04.380 --> 4:00:08.340\n And so it's kind of like, you know, and that's,\n\n4:00:08.340 --> 4:00:11.180\n but the thing is what happens, you know,\n\n4:00:11.180 --> 4:00:14.980\n this is what happens, mature fields do not, you know,\n\n4:00:14.980 --> 4:00:16.420\n it's like, we're doing what we're doing.\n\n4:00:16.420 --> 4:00:18.220\n We have the methods that we have\n\n4:00:18.220 --> 4:00:20.220\n and we're just fine here.\n\n4:00:20.220 --> 4:00:23.380\n Now what's happened in the last 18 years or so,\n\n4:00:23.380 --> 4:00:25.460\n I think there's a couple of things have happened.\n\n4:00:25.460 --> 4:00:29.260\n First of all, the hope that, you know,\n\n4:00:29.260 --> 4:00:31.300\n string theory or whatever would deliver\n\n4:00:31.300 --> 4:00:32.460\n the fundamental theory of physics,\n\n4:00:32.460 --> 4:00:34.540\n that hope has disappeared.\n\n4:00:34.540 --> 4:00:36.820\n That the, another thing that's happened\n\n4:00:36.820 --> 4:00:41.020\n is the sort of the interest in computation around physics\n\n4:00:41.020 --> 4:00:42.460\n has been greatly enhanced\n\n4:00:42.460 --> 4:00:44.020\n by the whole quantum information,\n\n4:00:44.020 --> 4:00:46.020\n quantum computing story.\n\n4:00:46.020 --> 4:00:47.940\n People, you know, the idea there might be something\n\n4:00:47.940 --> 4:00:51.100\n sort of computational related to physics\n\n4:00:51.100 --> 4:00:53.060\n has somehow grown.\n\n4:00:53.060 --> 4:00:55.820\n And I think, you know, it's sort of interesting.\n\n4:00:55.820 --> 4:00:58.060\n I mean, right now, if we say, you know,\n\n4:00:58.060 --> 4:00:59.700\n it's like, if you're like,\n\n4:00:59.700 --> 4:01:00.820\n who else is trying to come up\n\n4:01:00.820 --> 4:01:02.420\n with the fundamental theory of physics?\n\n4:01:02.420 --> 4:01:04.460\n It's like, there aren't professional,\n\n4:01:04.460 --> 4:01:07.220\n no professional physicists, no professional physicists.\n\n4:01:07.220 --> 4:01:10.820\n What are your, I mean, you've talked with him,\n\n4:01:10.820 --> 4:01:12.820\n but just as a matter of personalities,\n\n4:01:12.820 --> 4:01:13.820\n cause it's a beautiful story.\n\n4:01:13.820 --> 4:01:17.100\n What are your thoughts about Eric Weinstein's work?\n\n4:01:17.100 --> 4:01:20.580\n You know, I think his, I mean,\n\n4:01:20.580 --> 4:01:23.420\n he did a PhD thesis in mathematical physics at Harvard.\n\n4:01:23.420 --> 4:01:24.580\n He's a mathematical physicist.\n\n4:01:24.580 --> 4:01:28.900\n And, you know, it seems like it's kind of,\n\n4:01:28.900 --> 4:01:30.940\n you know, it's in that framework.\n\n4:01:30.940 --> 4:01:32.820\n And it's kind of like,\n\n4:01:32.820 --> 4:01:35.940\n I'm not sure how much further it's got than his PhD thesis,\n\n4:01:35.940 --> 4:01:37.580\n which was 20 years ago or something.\n\n4:01:37.580 --> 4:01:40.740\n And I think that, you know, the, you know,\n\n4:01:40.740 --> 4:01:43.780\n it's a fairly specific piece of mathematical physics.\n\n4:01:43.780 --> 4:01:44.940\n That's quite nice.\n\n4:01:44.940 --> 4:01:45.780\n And...\n\n4:01:45.780 --> 4:01:47.540\n What trajectory do you hope it takes?\n\n4:01:47.540 --> 4:01:48.620\n I mean...\n\n4:01:48.620 --> 4:01:50.100\n Well, I think in his particular case,\n\n4:01:50.100 --> 4:01:51.380\n I mean, from what I understand,\n\n4:01:51.380 --> 4:01:52.940\n which is not everything at all,\n\n4:01:52.940 --> 4:01:54.820\n but, you know, I think I know the rough tradition,\n\n4:01:54.820 --> 4:01:58.980\n at least what he's operating in is sort of theory of gauge theories.\n\n4:01:58.980 --> 4:01:59.740\n Gauge theories, yeah.\n\n4:01:59.740 --> 4:02:01.100\n Local gauge invariants and so on.\n\n4:02:01.100 --> 4:02:04.180\n Okay, we are very close to understanding\n\n4:02:04.180 --> 4:02:06.220\n how local gauge invariants works in our models.\n\n4:02:06.220 --> 4:02:07.620\n And it's very beautiful.\n\n4:02:07.620 --> 4:02:09.420\n And it's very...\n\n4:02:09.420 --> 4:02:12.260\n And, you know, does some of the mathematical structure\n\n4:02:12.260 --> 4:02:14.340\n that he's enthusiastic about fit?\n\n4:02:14.340 --> 4:02:15.820\n Quite possibly, yes.\n\n4:02:15.820 --> 4:02:17.740\n So there might be a possibility of trying to understand\n\n4:02:17.740 --> 4:02:19.780\n how those things fit, how gauge theory fits.\n\n4:02:19.780 --> 4:02:20.620\n Yeah, very well.\n\n4:02:20.620 --> 4:02:21.980\n I mean, the question is, you know,\n\n4:02:21.980 --> 4:02:22.820\n so there are a couple of things\n\n4:02:22.820 --> 4:02:24.100\n one might try to get in the world.\n\n4:02:24.100 --> 4:02:25.660\n So for example, it's like,\n\n4:02:25.660 --> 4:02:27.100\n can we get three dimensions of space?\n\n4:02:27.100 --> 4:02:28.860\n We haven't managed to get that yet.\n\n4:02:28.860 --> 4:02:32.380\n Gauge theory, the standard model of particle physics says,\n\n4:02:32.380 --> 4:02:35.620\n but it's SU3 cross SU2 cross U1.\n\n4:02:35.620 --> 4:02:39.980\n Those are the designations of these Lie groups.\n\n4:02:39.980 --> 4:02:41.340\n It doesn't, but anyway,\n\n4:02:41.340 --> 4:02:43.700\n so those are sort of representations\n\n4:02:43.700 --> 4:02:46.460\n of symmetries of the theory.\n\n4:02:46.460 --> 4:02:50.060\n And so, you know, it is conceivable\n\n4:02:50.060 --> 4:02:52.660\n that it is generically true.\n\n4:02:52.660 --> 4:02:55.340\n Okay, so all those are subgroups of a group called E8,\n\n4:02:55.340 --> 4:02:59.620\n which is a weird, exceptional Lie group, okay?\n\n4:02:59.620 --> 4:03:02.100\n It is conceivable, I don't know whether it's the case,\n\n4:03:02.100 --> 4:03:05.100\n that that will be generic in these models,\n\n4:03:05.100 --> 4:03:06.780\n that it will be generic,\n\n4:03:06.780 --> 4:03:11.780\n that the gauge invariance of the model has this property,\n\n4:03:12.020 --> 4:03:15.100\n just as things like general relativity,\n\n4:03:15.100 --> 4:03:20.100\n which corresponds to the thing called general covariance,\n\n4:03:20.100 --> 4:03:23.100\n which is another gauge like invariance.\n\n4:03:23.100 --> 4:03:25.340\n It could conceivably be the case\n\n4:03:25.340 --> 4:03:27.460\n that the kind of local gauge invariance\n\n4:03:27.460 --> 4:03:30.580\n that we see in particle physics is somehow generic.\n\n4:03:30.580 --> 4:03:32.300\n And that would be a, you know,\n\n4:03:32.300 --> 4:03:35.380\n the thing that's really cool, I think, you know,\n\n4:03:35.380 --> 4:03:38.100\n sociologically, although this hasn't really hit yet,\n\n4:03:38.100 --> 4:03:40.020\n is that all of these different things,\n\n4:03:40.020 --> 4:03:41.660\n all these different things people have been working on\n\n4:03:41.660 --> 4:03:43.260\n in these, in some cases,\n\n4:03:43.260 --> 4:03:46.500\n quite abstruse areas of mathematical physics,\n\n4:03:46.500 --> 4:03:49.420\n an awful lot of them seem to tie into what we're doing.\n\n4:03:49.420 --> 4:03:51.460\n And, you know, it might not be that way.\n\n4:03:51.460 --> 4:03:52.300\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n4:03:52.300 --> 4:03:53.740\n That's a beautiful thing, I think.\n\n4:03:53.740 --> 4:03:58.100\n I mean, but the reason Eric Weinstein is important\n\n4:03:58.100 --> 4:04:00.180\n is to the point that you mentioned before,\n\n4:04:00.180 --> 4:04:04.380\n which is, it's strange that the theory of everything\n\n4:04:04.380 --> 4:04:09.380\n is not at the core of the passion, the dream,\n\n4:04:09.780 --> 4:04:14.140\n the focus, the funding of the physics community.\n\n4:04:14.140 --> 4:04:15.100\n It's too hard.\n\n4:04:16.420 --> 4:04:17.980\n It's too hard and people gave up.\n\n4:04:17.980 --> 4:04:21.420\n I mean, basically what happened is ancient Greece,\n\n4:04:21.420 --> 4:04:23.060\n people thought we're nearly there.\n\n4:04:23.060 --> 4:04:25.100\n You know, the world is made of platonic solids.\n\n4:04:25.100 --> 4:04:27.700\n It's, you know, water is a tetrahedron or something.\n\n4:04:27.700 --> 4:04:29.700\n We're almost there, okay?\n\n4:04:29.700 --> 4:04:32.180\n Long period of time where people were like,\n\n4:04:32.180 --> 4:04:34.020\n no, we don't know how it works.\n\n4:04:34.020 --> 4:04:36.980\n You know, time of Newton, you know, we're almost there.\n\n4:04:36.980 --> 4:04:38.740\n Everything is gravitation.\n\n4:04:38.740 --> 4:04:42.380\n You know, time of Faraday and Maxwell, we're almost there.\n\n4:04:42.380 --> 4:04:45.500\n Everything is fields, everything is the ether, you know?\n\n4:04:45.500 --> 4:04:46.340\n Then...\n\n4:04:46.340 --> 4:04:48.940\n And the whole time we're making big progress though.\n\n4:04:48.940 --> 4:04:50.140\n Oh yes, absolutely.\n\n4:04:50.140 --> 4:04:53.860\n But the fundamental theory of physics is almost a footnote\n\n4:04:53.860 --> 4:04:56.900\n because it's like, it's the machine code.\n\n4:04:56.900 --> 4:04:59.340\n It's like we're operating in the high level languages.\n\n4:04:59.340 --> 4:05:00.180\n Yeah.\n\n4:05:00.180 --> 4:05:01.700\n You know, that's what we really care about.\n\n4:05:01.700 --> 4:05:03.660\n That's what's relevant for our everyday physics.\n\n4:05:03.660 --> 4:05:05.020\n You talked about different centuries\n\n4:05:05.020 --> 4:05:08.820\n and the 21st century will be everything is computation.\n\n4:05:08.820 --> 4:05:09.660\n Yes.\n\n4:05:09.660 --> 4:05:11.500\n If that takes us all the way, we don't know,\n\n4:05:11.500 --> 4:05:13.260\n but it might take us pretty far.\n\n4:05:13.260 --> 4:05:14.580\n Yes, right, that's right.\n\n4:05:14.580 --> 4:05:17.060\n And I, but I think the point is that it's like, you know,\n\n4:05:17.060 --> 4:05:18.700\n if you're doing biology, you might say,\n\n4:05:18.700 --> 4:05:21.140\n how can you not be really interested in the origin of life\n\n4:05:21.140 --> 4:05:22.700\n and the definition of life?\n\n4:05:22.700 --> 4:05:23.540\n Well, it's irrelevant.\n\n4:05:23.540 --> 4:05:26.020\n You know, you're studying the properties of some virus.\n\n4:05:26.020 --> 4:05:28.020\n It doesn't matter, you know, where, you know,\n\n4:05:28.020 --> 4:05:30.620\n you're operating at some much higher level.\n\n4:05:30.620 --> 4:05:34.180\n And it's the same, what's happening with physics is,\n\n4:05:34.180 --> 4:05:35.420\n I was sort of surprised actually.\n\n4:05:35.420 --> 4:05:38.780\n I was sort of mapping out this history of people's efforts\n\n4:05:38.780 --> 4:05:41.180\n to understand the fundamental theory of physics.\n\n4:05:41.180 --> 4:05:45.220\n And it's remarkable how little has been done on this question.\n\n4:05:45.220 --> 4:05:47.100\n And it's, you know, because, you know,\n\n4:05:47.100 --> 4:05:49.340\n there've been times when there's been bursts of enthusiasm.\n\n4:05:49.340 --> 4:05:50.940\n Oh, we're almost there.\n\n4:05:50.940 --> 4:05:54.940\n And then it decays and people just say,\n\n4:05:54.940 --> 4:05:57.260\n oh, it's too hard, but it's not relevant anyway.\n\n4:05:57.260 --> 4:06:01.140\n And I think that the thing that, you know,\n\n4:06:01.140 --> 4:06:04.860\n so the question of, you know, one question is,\n\n4:06:04.860 --> 4:06:07.420\n why does anybody, why should anybody care, right?\n\n4:06:07.420 --> 4:06:08.500\n Why should anybody care\n\n4:06:08.500 --> 4:06:10.420\n what the fundamental theory of physics is?\n\n4:06:10.420 --> 4:06:13.140\n I think it's intellectually interesting,\n\n4:06:13.140 --> 4:06:14.820\n but what will be the sort of,\n\n4:06:14.820 --> 4:06:16.460\n what will be the impact of this?\n\n4:06:16.460 --> 4:06:18.900\n What, I mean, this is the key question.\n\n4:06:18.900 --> 4:06:20.660\n What do you think will happen\n\n4:06:20.660 --> 4:06:25.260\n if we figure out the fundamental theory of physics?\n\n4:06:25.260 --> 4:06:26.100\n Right.\n\n4:06:26.100 --> 4:06:28.140\n Outside of the intellectual curiosity of us.\n\n4:06:28.140 --> 4:06:31.340\n Okay, so here's my best guess, okay?\n\n4:06:31.340 --> 4:06:33.540\n So if you look at the history of science,\n\n4:06:33.540 --> 4:06:37.420\n I think a very interesting analogy is Copernicus.\n\n4:06:37.420 --> 4:06:39.740\n Okay, so what did Copernicus do?\n\n4:06:39.740 --> 4:06:41.340\n There'd been this Ptolemaic system\n\n4:06:41.340 --> 4:06:43.260\n for working out the motion of planets.\n\n4:06:43.260 --> 4:06:44.740\n It did pretty well.\n\n4:06:44.740 --> 4:06:47.100\n It used epicycles, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n4:06:47.100 --> 4:06:49.340\n It had all this computational ways\n\n4:06:49.340 --> 4:06:51.180\n of working out where planets will be.\n\n4:06:51.180 --> 4:06:52.740\n When we work out where planets are today,\n\n4:06:52.740 --> 4:06:54.860\n we're basically using epicycles.\n\n4:06:54.860 --> 4:06:58.060\n But Copernicus had this different way of formulating things\n\n4:06:58.060 --> 4:07:00.260\n in which he said, you know,\n\n4:07:00.260 --> 4:07:02.980\n and the earth is going around the sun,\n\n4:07:02.980 --> 4:07:04.180\n and that had a consequence.\n\n4:07:04.180 --> 4:07:07.900\n The consequence was you can use this mathematical theory\n\n4:07:07.900 --> 4:07:10.740\n to conclude something which is absolutely not\n\n4:07:10.740 --> 4:07:14.180\n what we can tell from common sense, right?\n\n4:07:14.180 --> 4:07:18.420\n So it's like, trust the mathematics, trust the science, okay?\n\n4:07:18.420 --> 4:07:21.060\n Now fast forward 400 years,\n\n4:07:21.060 --> 4:07:23.900\n and now we're in this pandemic,\n\n4:07:23.900 --> 4:07:26.500\n and it's kind of like everybody thinks the science\n\n4:07:26.500 --> 4:07:28.260\n will figure out everything.\n\n4:07:28.260 --> 4:07:30.020\n It's like from the science,\n\n4:07:30.020 --> 4:07:31.380\n we can just figure out what to do.\n\n4:07:31.380 --> 4:07:32.940\n We can figure out everything.\n\n4:07:32.940 --> 4:07:34.820\n That was before Copernicus.\n\n4:07:34.820 --> 4:07:37.700\n Nobody would have thought if the science says something\n\n4:07:37.700 --> 4:07:40.780\n that doesn't agree with our everyday experience,\n\n4:07:40.780 --> 4:07:43.180\n where we just have to compute the science\n\n4:07:43.180 --> 4:07:44.420\n and then figure out what to do,\n\n4:07:44.420 --> 4:07:46.380\n people would say that's completely crazy.\n\n4:07:46.380 --> 4:07:47.580\n And so your sense is,\n\n4:07:47.580 --> 4:07:49.820\n once we figure out the framework of computation\n\n4:07:49.820 --> 4:07:51.780\n that can basically do any,\n\n4:07:51.780 --> 4:07:53.780\n understand the fabric of reality,\n\n4:07:53.780 --> 4:07:58.780\n we'll be able to derive totally counterintuitive things.\n\n4:07:58.900 --> 4:08:01.580\n No, the point I think is the following.\n\n4:08:01.580 --> 4:08:03.020\n That right now, you know,\n\n4:08:03.020 --> 4:08:05.740\n I talk about computational irreducibility.\n\n4:08:05.740 --> 4:08:07.820\n People, you know, I was very proud\n\n4:08:07.820 --> 4:08:10.140\n that I managed to get the term computational irreducibility\n\n4:08:10.140 --> 4:08:13.020\n into the congressional record last year.\n\n4:08:13.020 --> 4:08:13.860\n That's right, by the way,\n\n4:08:13.860 --> 4:08:15.460\n that's a whole nother topic we could talk about.\n\n4:08:15.460 --> 4:08:17.140\n Fascinating. Different topic.\n\n4:08:17.140 --> 4:08:18.180\n Different topic.\n\n4:08:18.180 --> 4:08:20.420\n But Tim, in any case, you know,\n\n4:08:20.420 --> 4:08:22.140\n but so computational irreducibility\n\n4:08:22.140 --> 4:08:23.900\n is one of these sort of concepts\n\n4:08:23.900 --> 4:08:25.420\n that I think is important in understanding\n\n4:08:25.420 --> 4:08:26.980\n lots of things in the world.\n\n4:08:26.980 --> 4:08:29.180\n But the question is, it's only important\n\n4:08:29.180 --> 4:08:32.100\n if you believe the world is fundamentally computational.\n\n4:08:32.100 --> 4:08:33.140\n Right?\n\n4:08:33.140 --> 4:08:35.940\n But if you know the fundamental theory of physics\n\n4:08:35.940 --> 4:08:38.260\n and it's fundamentally computational,\n\n4:08:38.260 --> 4:08:40.180\n then you've rooted the whole thing.\n\n4:08:40.180 --> 4:08:43.140\n That is, you know the world is computational.\n\n4:08:43.140 --> 4:08:47.260\n And while you can discuss whether, you know,\n\n4:08:47.260 --> 4:08:48.820\n it's not the case that people would say,\n\n4:08:48.820 --> 4:08:50.940\n well, you have this whole computational irreducibility,\n\n4:08:50.940 --> 4:08:52.580\n all these features of computation.\n\n4:08:52.580 --> 4:08:54.100\n We don't care about those\n\n4:08:54.100 --> 4:08:56.180\n because after all the world isn't computational,\n\n4:08:56.180 --> 4:08:57.300\n you might say.\n\n4:08:57.300 --> 4:09:01.260\n But if you know, you know, base, base, base thing,\n\n4:09:01.260 --> 4:09:03.220\n physics is computational,\n\n4:09:03.220 --> 4:09:05.540\n then you know that that stuff is, you know,\n\n4:09:05.540 --> 4:09:07.700\n that that's kind of the grounding for that stuff.\n\n4:09:07.700 --> 4:09:10.540\n Just as in a sense Copernicus was the grounding\n\n4:09:10.540 --> 4:09:12.900\n for the idea that you could figure out something\n\n4:09:12.900 --> 4:09:14.620\n with math and science\n\n4:09:14.620 --> 4:09:18.820\n that was not what you would intuitively think\n\n4:09:18.820 --> 4:09:20.100\n from your senses.\n\n4:09:20.100 --> 4:09:22.780\n So now we've got to this point where, for example,\n\n4:09:22.780 --> 4:09:25.220\n we say, you know, once we have the idea\n\n4:09:25.220 --> 4:09:27.940\n that computation is the foundational thing\n\n4:09:27.940 --> 4:09:30.100\n that explains our whole universe,\n\n4:09:30.100 --> 4:09:32.020\n then we have to say, well, what does it mean\n\n4:09:32.020 --> 4:09:32.860\n for other things?\n\n4:09:32.860 --> 4:09:35.220\n Like it means there's computational irreducibility.\n\n4:09:35.220 --> 4:09:37.860\n That means science is limited in certain ways.\n\n4:09:37.860 --> 4:09:39.740\n That means this, that means that.\n\n4:09:39.740 --> 4:09:43.260\n But the fact that we have that grounding means that,\n\n4:09:43.260 --> 4:09:45.660\n you know, and I think, for example, for Copernicus,\n\n4:09:45.660 --> 4:09:49.140\n for instance, the implications of his work\n\n4:09:49.140 --> 4:09:52.340\n on the set of mathematics of astronomy were cool,\n\n4:09:52.340 --> 4:09:54.540\n but they involved a very small number of people.\n\n4:09:54.540 --> 4:09:56.900\n The implications of his work for sort of the philosophy\n\n4:09:56.900 --> 4:09:59.820\n of how you think about things were vast\n\n4:09:59.820 --> 4:10:02.820\n and involved, you know, everybody more or less.\n\n4:10:02.820 --> 4:10:05.740\n But do you think, so that's actually the way scientists\n\n4:10:05.740 --> 4:10:08.540\n and people see the world around us.\n\n4:10:08.540 --> 4:10:10.580\n So it has a huge impact in that sense.\n\n4:10:10.580 --> 4:10:14.220\n Do you think it might have an impact more directly\n\n4:10:14.220 --> 4:10:18.100\n to engineering derivations from physics,\n\n4:10:18.100 --> 4:10:21.980\n like propulsion systems, our ability to colonize the world?\n\n4:10:21.980 --> 4:10:24.580\n Like, for example, okay, this is like sci fi,\n\n4:10:24.580 --> 4:10:29.580\n but if you understand the computational nature, say,\n\n4:10:30.420 --> 4:10:34.300\n of the different forces of physics, you know,\n\n4:10:34.300 --> 4:10:38.420\n there's a notion of being able to warp gravity,\n\n4:10:38.420 --> 4:10:39.260\n things like this.\n\n4:10:39.260 --> 4:10:40.500\n Yeah, can we make warp drive?\n\n4:10:40.500 --> 4:10:41.700\n Warp drive, yeah.\n\n4:10:41.700 --> 4:10:45.660\n So like, would we be able to, will, you know,\n\n4:10:45.660 --> 4:10:47.580\n will like Elon Musk start paying attention?\n\n4:10:47.580 --> 4:10:50.460\n Like it's awfully costly to launch these rockets.\n\n4:10:50.460 --> 4:10:52.820\n Do you think we'll be able to, yeah, create warp drive?\n\n4:10:52.820 --> 4:10:55.340\n And, you know, I set myself some homework.\n\n4:10:55.340 --> 4:10:57.580\n I agreed to give a talk at some NASA workshop\n\n4:10:57.580 --> 4:10:59.860\n in a few weeks about faster than light travel.\n\n4:10:59.860 --> 4:11:02.700\n So I haven't figured it out yet, but no, but.\n\n4:11:02.700 --> 4:11:03.540\n You got two weeks.\n\n4:11:03.540 --> 4:11:04.380\n Yeah, right.\n\n4:11:04.380 --> 4:11:06.260\n But do you think that kind of understanding\n\n4:11:06.260 --> 4:11:07.980\n of fundamental theory of physics can lead\n\n4:11:07.980 --> 4:11:09.540\n to those engineering breakthroughs?\n\n4:11:09.540 --> 4:11:12.020\n Okay, I think it's far away, but I'm not certain.\n\n4:11:12.020 --> 4:11:14.660\n I mean, you know, this is the thing that,\n\n4:11:14.660 --> 4:11:16.940\n I set myself an exercise when gravity waves,\n\n4:11:16.940 --> 4:11:19.220\n gravitational waves were discovered, right?\n\n4:11:19.220 --> 4:11:22.020\n I set myself the exercise of what would black hole\n\n4:11:22.020 --> 4:11:23.780\n technology look like?\n\n4:11:23.780 --> 4:11:25.260\n In other words, right now, you know,\n\n4:11:25.260 --> 4:11:26.420\n black holes are far away.\n\n4:11:26.420 --> 4:11:28.100\n They're, you know, how on earth can we do things with them?\n\n4:11:28.100 --> 4:11:30.060\n But just imagine that we could get, you know,\n\n4:11:30.060 --> 4:11:32.460\n pet black holes right in our backyard.\n\n4:11:32.460 --> 4:11:34.500\n You know, what kind of technology could we build with them?\n\n4:11:34.500 --> 4:11:36.700\n I got a certain distance, not that far,\n\n4:11:36.700 --> 4:11:40.020\n but I think in, you know, so there are ideas, you know,\n\n4:11:40.020 --> 4:11:42.340\n I have this, one of the weirder ideas is things\n\n4:11:42.340 --> 4:11:44.140\n I'm calling space tunnels,\n\n4:11:44.140 --> 4:11:47.820\n which are higher dimensional pieces of space time,\n\n4:11:47.820 --> 4:11:50.020\n where basically you can, you know,\n\n4:11:50.020 --> 4:11:51.980\n in our three dimensional space,\n\n4:11:51.980 --> 4:11:54.620\n there might be a five dimensional, you know,\n\n4:11:54.620 --> 4:11:57.020\n region, which actually will appear as a white hole\n\n4:11:57.020 --> 4:11:59.300\n at one end and a black hole at the other end,\n\n4:11:59.300 --> 4:12:01.060\n you know, who knows whether they exist.\n\n4:12:01.060 --> 4:12:02.700\n And then the questions, another one,\n\n4:12:02.700 --> 4:12:04.420\n okay, this is another crazy one,\n\n4:12:04.420 --> 4:12:07.620\n is the thing that I'm calling a vacuum cleaner, okay?\n\n4:12:07.620 --> 4:12:10.620\n So, I mentioned that, you know,\n\n4:12:10.620 --> 4:12:12.580\n there's all this activity in the universe,\n\n4:12:12.580 --> 4:12:14.980\n which is maintaining the structure of space.\n\n4:12:14.980 --> 4:12:18.260\n And that leads to a certain energy density\n\n4:12:18.260 --> 4:12:20.100\n effectively in space.\n\n4:12:20.100 --> 4:12:23.620\n And so the question, in fact, dark energy\n\n4:12:23.620 --> 4:12:26.820\n is a story of essentially negative mass\n\n4:12:26.820 --> 4:12:30.900\n produced by the absence of energy\n\n4:12:30.900 --> 4:12:33.180\n you thought would be there, so to speak.\n\n4:12:33.180 --> 4:12:34.820\n And we don't know exactly how it works\n\n4:12:34.820 --> 4:12:37.700\n in either our model or the physical universe,\n\n4:12:37.700 --> 4:12:41.860\n but this notion of a vacuum cleaner is a thing where,\n\n4:12:41.860 --> 4:12:43.060\n you know, you have all these things\n\n4:12:43.060 --> 4:12:44.500\n that are maintaining the structure of space,\n\n4:12:44.500 --> 4:12:47.580\n but what if you could clean out some of that stuff\n\n4:12:47.580 --> 4:12:49.460\n that's maintaining the structure of space\n\n4:12:49.460 --> 4:12:51.860\n and make a simpler vacuum somewhere?\n\n4:12:51.860 --> 4:12:52.700\n You know, what would that do?\n\n4:12:52.700 --> 4:12:54.220\n A totally different kind of vacuum.\n\n4:12:54.220 --> 4:12:57.180\n Right, and that would lead to negative energy density,\n\n4:12:57.180 --> 4:12:59.420\n which would need to, so gravity is usually\n\n4:12:59.420 --> 4:13:02.420\n a purely attractive force, but negative mass\n\n4:13:02.420 --> 4:13:06.180\n would lead to repulsive gravity\n\n4:13:06.180 --> 4:13:08.540\n and lead to all kinds of weird things.\n\n4:13:08.540 --> 4:13:11.220\n Now, can it be done in our universe?\n\n4:13:11.220 --> 4:13:14.820\n You know, my immediate thought is no,\n\n4:13:14.820 --> 4:13:18.420\n but you know, the fact is that, okay, so here's the thing.\n\n4:13:18.420 --> 4:13:19.620\n Well, once you understand the fact,\n\n4:13:19.620 --> 4:13:21.580\n because you're saying like, at this level of abstraction,\n\n4:13:21.580 --> 4:13:25.420\n can we reach to the lower levels and mess with it?\n\n4:13:25.420 --> 4:13:26.260\n Yes.\n\n4:13:26.260 --> 4:13:27.940\n Once you understand the levels, I think you can start to.\n\n4:13:27.940 --> 4:13:30.700\n I know, and I'm, you know, I have to say\n\n4:13:30.700 --> 4:13:34.660\n that this reminds me of people telling one years ago\n\n4:13:34.660 --> 4:13:36.300\n that, you know, you'll never transmit data\n\n4:13:36.300 --> 4:13:38.740\n over a copper wire at more than 1,000,\n\n4:13:38.740 --> 4:13:41.460\n you know, 1,000 board or something, right?\n\n4:13:41.460 --> 4:13:43.940\n And this is, why did that not happen?\n\n4:13:43.940 --> 4:13:45.580\n You know, why do we have this much,\n\n4:13:45.580 --> 4:13:46.940\n much faster data transmission?\n\n4:13:46.940 --> 4:13:48.820\n Because we've understood many more of the details\n\n4:13:48.820 --> 4:13:50.380\n of what's actually going on.\n\n4:13:50.380 --> 4:13:52.540\n And it's the same exact story here.\n\n4:13:52.540 --> 4:13:54.740\n And it's the same, you know, I think that this,\n\n4:13:54.740 --> 4:13:58.580\n as I say, I think one of the features of sort of,\n\n4:13:58.580 --> 4:14:00.540\n one of the things about our time\n\n4:14:00.540 --> 4:14:03.020\n that will seem incredibly naive in the future\n\n4:14:03.020 --> 4:14:06.220\n is the belief that, you know, things like heat\n\n4:14:06.220 --> 4:14:08.380\n is just random motion of molecules,\n\n4:14:08.380 --> 4:14:12.460\n that it's just throw up your hands, it's just random.\n\n4:14:12.460 --> 4:14:14.060\n We can't say anything about it.\n\n4:14:14.060 --> 4:14:15.660\n That will seem naive.\n\n4:14:15.660 --> 4:14:18.100\n Yeah, at the heat death of the universe,\n\n4:14:18.100 --> 4:14:20.980\n those particles would be laughing at us humans thinking.\n\n4:14:20.980 --> 4:14:22.380\n Yes, right.\n\n4:14:22.380 --> 4:14:23.220\n That life is not beautiful.\n\n4:14:23.220 --> 4:14:25.900\n I'll have a whole civilization, you know.\n\n4:14:25.900 --> 4:14:27.580\n Humans used to think they're special\n\n4:14:27.580 --> 4:14:28.980\n with their little brains.\n\n4:14:28.980 --> 4:14:31.260\n Well, right, but also, and they used to think\n\n4:14:31.260 --> 4:14:33.940\n that this would just be random and uninteresting.\n\n4:14:33.940 --> 4:14:37.620\n But that's, but so this question about whether you can,\n\n4:14:37.620 --> 4:14:39.980\n you know, mess with the underlying structure\n\n4:14:39.980 --> 4:14:42.860\n and how you find a way to mess with the underlying structure,\n\n4:14:42.860 --> 4:14:45.660\n that's a, you know, I have to say, you know,\n\n4:14:45.660 --> 4:14:48.820\n my immediate thing is, boy, that seems really hard,\n\n4:14:48.820 --> 4:14:50.980\n but then, and you know,\n\n4:14:50.980 --> 4:14:54.020\n possibly computational irreducibility will bite you,\n\n4:14:54.020 --> 4:14:55.540\n but then there's always some path\n\n4:14:55.540 --> 4:14:57.380\n of computational reducibility.\n\n4:14:57.380 --> 4:14:59.740\n And that path of computational reducibility\n\n4:14:59.740 --> 4:15:02.540\n is the engineering invention that has to be made.\n\n4:15:02.540 --> 4:15:05.980\n Those little pockets can have huge engineering impact.\n\n4:15:05.980 --> 4:15:07.780\n Right, and I think that that's right.\n\n4:15:07.780 --> 4:15:10.380\n And I mean, we live in, you know, we make use of so many\n\n4:15:10.380 --> 4:15:11.420\n of those pockets.\n\n4:15:11.420 --> 4:15:16.420\n And the fact is, you know, I, you know, this is, yes,\n\n4:15:16.980 --> 4:15:20.380\n it's a, you know, it's one of these things where,\n\n4:15:20.380 --> 4:15:24.740\n where, you know, I'm a person who likes to figure out ideas\n\n4:15:24.740 --> 4:15:28.060\n and so on, and the sort of tests of my level of imagination,\n\n4:15:28.060 --> 4:15:29.180\n so to speak.\n\n4:15:29.180 --> 4:15:32.700\n And so a couple of places where there's sort of serious\n\n4:15:32.700 --> 4:15:35.460\n humility in terms of my level of imagination,\n\n4:15:35.460 --> 4:15:38.220\n one is this thing about different reference frames\n\n4:15:38.220 --> 4:15:39.860\n for understanding the universe,\n\n4:15:39.860 --> 4:15:42.260\n where like, imagine the physics of the aliens,\n\n4:15:42.260 --> 4:15:43.660\n what will it be like?\n\n4:15:43.660 --> 4:15:45.780\n And I'm like, that's really hard.\n\n4:15:45.780 --> 4:15:47.500\n I don't know, you know?\n\n4:15:47.500 --> 4:15:48.340\n And I mean, I think that...\n\n4:15:48.340 --> 4:15:49.980\n But once you have the framework in place,\n\n4:15:49.980 --> 4:15:53.940\n you can at least reason about the things you don't know,\n\n4:15:53.940 --> 4:15:57.620\n maybe can't know, or like, it's too hard for you to know,\n\n4:15:57.620 --> 4:16:01.620\n but then the mathematics can, that's exactly it,\n\n4:16:01.620 --> 4:16:05.900\n allow you to reach beyond where you can reason about.\n\n4:16:05.900 --> 4:16:09.340\n So I'm, you know, I'm trying to not have, you know,\n\n4:16:09.340 --> 4:16:11.660\n if you think back to Alan Turing, for example,\n\n4:16:11.660 --> 4:16:14.260\n and, you know, when he invented Turing machines, you know,\n\n4:16:14.260 --> 4:16:16.980\n and imagining what computers would end up doing,\n\n4:16:16.980 --> 4:16:17.820\n so to speak.\n\n4:16:17.820 --> 4:16:18.660\n Yeah.\n\n4:16:18.660 --> 4:16:19.500\n You know, and it's...\n\n4:16:19.500 --> 4:16:20.340\n It's very difficult.\n\n4:16:20.340 --> 4:16:21.180\n It's difficult, right.\n\n4:16:21.180 --> 4:16:22.020\n And it's, and I mean, this thing...\n\n4:16:22.020 --> 4:16:23.460\n Made a few reasonable predictions,\n\n4:16:23.460 --> 4:16:25.500\n but most of it, he couldn't predict, possibly.\n\n4:16:25.500 --> 4:16:28.300\n By the time, by 1950, he was making reasonable predictions\n\n4:16:28.300 --> 4:16:29.140\n about some things.\n\n4:16:29.140 --> 4:16:30.140\n But not the 30s, yeah.\n\n4:16:30.140 --> 4:16:34.660\n Right, not when he first, you know, conceptualized,\n\n4:16:34.660 --> 4:16:37.380\n you know, and he conceptualized universal computing\n\n4:16:37.380 --> 4:16:39.180\n for a very specific mathematical reason\n\n4:16:39.180 --> 4:16:41.340\n that wasn't as general.\n\n4:16:41.340 --> 4:16:44.220\n But yes, it's a good sort of exercise in humility\n\n4:16:44.220 --> 4:16:46.860\n to realize that it's kind of like,\n\n4:16:46.860 --> 4:16:49.580\n it's really hard to figure these things out.\n\n4:16:49.580 --> 4:16:52.260\n The engineering of the universe,\n\n4:16:52.260 --> 4:16:55.860\n if we know how the universe works, how can we engineer it?\n\n4:16:55.860 --> 4:16:57.580\n That's such a beautiful vision.\n\n4:16:57.580 --> 4:16:58.420\n That's such a beautiful vision.\n\n4:16:58.420 --> 4:16:59.740\n By the way, I have to mention one more thing,\n\n4:16:59.740 --> 4:17:04.300\n which is the ultimate question from physics is,\n\n4:17:04.300 --> 4:17:07.380\n okay, so we have this abstract model of the universe.\n\n4:17:07.380 --> 4:17:11.260\n Why does the universe exist at all, right?\n\n4:17:11.260 --> 4:17:15.220\n So, you know, we might say there is a formal model\n\n4:17:15.220 --> 4:17:18.100\n that if you run this model, you get the universe,\n\n4:17:18.100 --> 4:17:21.900\n or the model gives you, you know, a model of the universe,\n\n4:17:21.900 --> 4:17:25.300\n right, you run this mathematical thing\n\n4:17:25.300 --> 4:17:27.820\n and the mathematics unfolds in the way\n\n4:17:27.820 --> 4:17:29.420\n that corresponds to the universe.\n\n4:17:29.420 --> 4:17:32.460\n But the question is, why was that actualized?\n\n4:17:32.460 --> 4:17:35.980\n Why does the actual universe actually exist?\n\n4:17:35.980 --> 4:17:39.220\n And so this is another one of these humility\n\n4:17:39.220 --> 4:17:41.700\n and it's like, can you figure this out?\n\n4:17:41.700 --> 4:17:44.780\n I have a guess, okay, about the answer to that.\n\n4:17:44.780 --> 4:17:47.820\n And my guess is somewhat unsatisfying,\n\n4:17:47.820 --> 4:17:50.380\n but my guess is that it's a little bit similar\n\n4:17:50.380 --> 4:17:52.740\n to G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem,\n\n4:17:52.740 --> 4:17:55.180\n which is the statement that from within,\n\n4:17:55.180 --> 4:17:58.060\n as an axiomatic theory like piano arithmetic,\n\n4:17:58.060 --> 4:17:59.780\n you cannot from within that theory\n\n4:17:59.780 --> 4:18:02.420\n prove the consistency of the theory.\n\n4:18:02.420 --> 4:18:07.420\n So my guess is that for entities within the universe,\n\n4:18:08.140 --> 4:18:11.540\n there is no finite determination that can be made\n\n4:18:11.540 --> 4:18:15.260\n of the statement the universe exists\n\n4:18:15.260 --> 4:18:18.580\n is essentially undecidable to any entity\n\n4:18:18.580 --> 4:18:19.900\n that is embedded in the universe.\n\n4:18:19.900 --> 4:18:22.780\n Within that universe, how does that make you feel?\n\n4:18:22.780 --> 4:18:27.780\n Does that put you at peace that it's impossible,\n\n4:18:27.980 --> 4:18:30.940\n or is it really ultimately frustrating?\n\n4:18:30.940 --> 4:18:35.460\n Well, I think it just says that it's not a kind of question\n\n4:18:35.460 --> 4:18:40.140\n that, you know, there are things that it is reasonable.\n\n4:18:40.140 --> 4:18:42.780\n I mean, there's kinds of, you know,\n\n4:18:42.780 --> 4:18:44.580\n you can talk about hyper computation as well.\n\n4:18:44.580 --> 4:18:46.500\n You can say, imagine there was a hyper computer,\n\n4:18:46.500 --> 4:18:47.700\n here's what it would do.\n\n4:18:47.700 --> 4:18:49.940\n So okay, great, it would be lovely to have a hyper computer,\n\n4:18:49.940 --> 4:18:52.300\n but unfortunately we can't make it in the universe.\n\n4:18:52.300 --> 4:18:53.540\n Like it would be lovely to answer this,\n\n4:18:53.540 --> 4:18:56.300\n but unfortunately we can't do it in the universe.\n\n4:18:56.300 --> 4:18:59.100\n And you know, this is all we have, so to speak.\n\n4:18:59.100 --> 4:19:02.340\n And I think it's really just a statement.\n\n4:19:02.340 --> 4:19:06.180\n It's sort of, in the end, it'll be a kind of a logical,\n\n4:19:06.180 --> 4:19:08.380\n logically inevitable statement, I think.\n\n4:19:08.380 --> 4:19:10.700\n I think it will be something where it is,\n\n4:19:10.700 --> 4:19:13.260\n as you understand what it means to have,\n\n4:19:13.260 --> 4:19:16.220\n what it means to have a sort of predicate of existence\n\n4:19:16.220 --> 4:19:17.780\n and what it means to have these kinds of things,\n\n4:19:17.780 --> 4:19:20.460\n it will sort of be inevitable that this has to be the case,\n\n4:19:20.460 --> 4:19:23.460\n that from within that universe, you can't establish\n\n4:19:23.460 --> 4:19:25.060\n the reason for its existence, so to speak.\n\n4:19:25.060 --> 4:19:26.900\n You can't prove that it exists and so on.\n\n4:19:26.900 --> 4:19:29.940\n And nevertheless, because of computational reducibility,\n\n4:19:29.940 --> 4:19:34.140\n the future is ultimately not predictable, full of mystery,\n\n4:19:34.140 --> 4:19:36.860\n and that's what makes life worth living.\n\n4:19:36.860 --> 4:19:37.780\n Right, I mean, right.\n\n4:19:37.780 --> 4:19:39.340\n And you know, it's funny for me,\n\n4:19:39.340 --> 4:19:43.100\n because as a pure sort of human being doing what I do,\n\n4:19:43.100 --> 4:19:46.780\n it's, you know, like I'm interested in people,\n\n4:19:46.780 --> 4:19:51.020\n I like sort of the whole human experience, so to speak.\n\n4:19:51.020 --> 4:19:53.980\n And yet, it's a little bit weird when I'm thinking,\n\n4:19:53.980 --> 4:19:56.460\n you know, it's all hypergraphs down there,\n\n4:19:56.460 --> 4:19:57.780\n and it's all just.\n\n4:19:57.780 --> 4:19:59.580\n Hypergraphs all the way down.\n\n4:19:59.580 --> 4:20:00.420\n Right.\n\n4:20:00.420 --> 4:20:01.380\n It's like turtles all the way down.\n\n4:20:01.380 --> 4:20:02.540\n Yeah, yeah, right.\n\n4:20:02.540 --> 4:20:06.580\n And it's kind of, you know, to me, it is a funny thing,\n\n4:20:06.580 --> 4:20:08.220\n because every so often I get this, you know,\n\n4:20:08.220 --> 4:20:10.620\n as I'm thinking about, I think we've really gotten,\n\n4:20:10.620 --> 4:20:12.500\n you know, we've really figured out kind of the essence\n\n4:20:12.500 --> 4:20:14.780\n of how physics works, and I'm like thinking to myself,\n\n4:20:14.780 --> 4:20:16.420\n you know, here's this physical thing,\n\n4:20:16.420 --> 4:20:17.780\n and I'm like, you know,\n\n4:20:17.780 --> 4:20:19.900\n this feels like a very definite thing.\n\n4:20:19.900 --> 4:20:21.460\n How can it be the case that this is just\n\n4:20:21.460 --> 4:20:23.980\n some rule or reference frame of, you know,\n\n4:20:23.980 --> 4:20:28.420\n this infinite creature that is so abstract and so on?\n\n4:20:28.420 --> 4:20:32.980\n And I kind of, it is a, it's a funny sort of feeling\n\n4:20:32.980 --> 4:20:37.620\n that, you know, we are, we're sort of, it's like,\n\n4:20:37.620 --> 4:20:39.580\n in the end, it's just sort of,\n\n4:20:39.580 --> 4:20:42.220\n we're just happy we're just humans type thing.\n\n4:20:42.220 --> 4:20:44.980\n And it's kind of like, but we're making,\n\n4:20:44.980 --> 4:20:49.980\n we make things as, it's not like we're just a tiny speck.\n\n4:20:50.020 --> 4:20:54.500\n We are, in a sense, the, we are more important\n\n4:20:54.500 --> 4:20:58.340\n by virtue of the fact that, in a sense,\n\n4:20:58.340 --> 4:21:02.780\n it's not like there's, there is no ultimate, you know,\n\n4:21:02.780 --> 4:21:05.020\n it's like, we're important because,\n\n4:21:06.540 --> 4:21:08.900\n because, you know, we're here, so to speak,\n\n4:21:08.900 --> 4:21:10.900\n and we're not, it's not like there's a thing\n\n4:21:10.900 --> 4:21:15.780\n where we're saying, you know, we are just but one\n\n4:21:15.780 --> 4:21:18.380\n sort of intelligence out of all these other intelligences.\n\n4:21:18.380 --> 4:21:20.860\n And so, you know, ultimately there'll be\n\n4:21:20.860 --> 4:21:23.980\n the super intelligence, which is all of these put together\n\n4:21:23.980 --> 4:21:25.260\n and they'll be very different from us.\n\n4:21:25.260 --> 4:21:27.540\n No, it's actually going to be equivalent to us.\n\n4:21:27.540 --> 4:21:31.380\n And the thing that makes us a sort of special\n\n4:21:31.380 --> 4:21:34.740\n is just the details of us, so to speak.\n\n4:21:34.740 --> 4:21:36.700\n It's not something where we can say,\n\n4:21:36.700 --> 4:21:38.980\n oh, there's this other thing, you know,\n\n4:21:38.980 --> 4:21:40.900\n just, you think humans are cool,\n\n4:21:40.900 --> 4:21:43.260\n just wait until you've seen this.\n\n4:21:43.260 --> 4:21:45.100\n You know, it's going to be much more impressive.\n\n4:21:45.100 --> 4:21:47.020\n Well, no, it's all going to be\n\n4:21:47.020 --> 4:21:48.900\n kind of computationally equivalent.\n\n4:21:48.900 --> 4:21:51.380\n And the thing that, you know, it's not going to be,\n\n4:21:51.380 --> 4:21:53.980\n oh, this thing is amazingly much more impressive\n\n4:21:53.980 --> 4:21:56.860\n and amazingly much more meaningful, let's say.\n\n4:21:56.860 --> 4:21:58.980\n No, we're it.\n\n4:21:58.980 --> 4:22:01.460\n I mean, that's the...\n\n4:22:01.460 --> 4:22:04.380\n And the symbolism of this particular moment.\n\n4:22:04.380 --> 4:22:07.020\n So this has been one of the,\n\n4:22:07.020 --> 4:22:10.860\n one of the favorite conversations I've ever had, Stephen.\n\n4:22:10.860 --> 4:22:12.700\n It's a huge honor to talk to you,\n\n4:22:12.700 --> 4:22:16.660\n to talk about a topic like this for four plus hours\n\n4:22:16.660 --> 4:22:18.620\n on the fundamental theory of physics.\n\n4:22:18.620 --> 4:22:22.900\n And yet we're just two finite descendants of apes\n\n4:22:22.900 --> 4:22:24.940\n that have to end this conversation\n\n4:22:24.940 --> 4:22:28.020\n because darkness have come upon us.\n\n4:22:28.020 --> 4:22:29.980\n Right, and we're going to get bitten by mosquitoes\n\n4:22:29.980 --> 4:22:30.820\n and all kinds of terrible things.\n\n4:22:30.820 --> 4:22:32.540\n The symbolism of that,\n\n4:22:32.540 --> 4:22:36.220\n we're talking about the most basic fabric of reality\n\n4:22:36.220 --> 4:22:39.980\n and having to end because of the fact that things end.\n\n4:22:40.900 --> 4:22:42.580\n It's tragic and beautiful, Stephen.\n\n4:22:42.580 --> 4:22:43.420\n Thank you so much.\n\n4:22:43.420 --> 4:22:44.380\n Huge honor.\n\n4:22:44.380 --> 4:22:47.100\n I can't wait to see what you do in the next couple of days\n\n4:22:47.100 --> 4:22:48.580\n and next week, a month.\n\n4:22:48.580 --> 4:22:50.700\n We're all watching with excitement.\n\n4:22:50.700 --> 4:22:51.540\n Thank you so much.\n\n4:22:51.540 --> 4:22:53.020\n Thanks.\n\n4:22:53.020 --> 4:22:54.500\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n4:22:54.500 --> 4:22:55.660\n with Stephen Wolfram.\n\n4:22:55.660 --> 4:22:57.540\n And thank you to our sponsors,\n\n4:22:57.540 --> 4:23:00.940\n SimplySafe, Sun Basket, and Masterclass.\n\n4:23:00.940 --> 4:23:03.220\n Please check out our
