of mutually assured digital destruction.\n\n00:08.960 --> 00:11.200\n How far are people willing to go?\n\n00:11.200 --> 00:13.040\n You can capture their location,\n\n00:13.040 --> 00:16.160\n you can capture their contacts\n\n00:16.160 --> 00:19.120\n that record their telephone calls, record their camera\n\n00:19.120 --> 00:20.780\n without them knowing about it.\n\n00:20.780 --> 00:24.400\n Basically, you can put an invisible ankle bracelet\n\n00:24.400 --> 00:26.000\n on someone without them knowing.\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:31.000\n You could sell that to a zero day broker for $2 million.\n\n00:34.280 --> 00:37.360\n The following is a conversation with Nicole Perlroth,\n\n00:37.360 --> 00:40.120\n cybersecurity journalist and author\n\n00:40.120 --> 00:42.560\n of This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends,\n\n00:42.560 --> 00:44.920\n The Cyber Weapons Arm Race.\n\n00:44.920 --> 00:46.960\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:46.960 --> 00:49.100\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:49.100 --> 00:50.360\n in the description.\n\n00:50.360 --> 00:54.320\n And now, dear friends, here's Nicole Perlroth.\n\n00:54.320 --> 00:58.580\n You've interviewed hundreds of cybersecurity hackers,\n\n00:58.580 --> 01:01.020\n activists, dissidents, computer scientists,\n\n01:01.020 --> 01:03.740\n government officials, forensic investigators,\n\n01:03.740 --> 01:05.700\n and mercenaries.\n\n01:05.700 --> 01:09.420\n So let's talk about cybersecurity and cyber war.\n\n01:09.420 --> 01:10.500\n Start with the basics.\n\n01:10.500 --> 01:13.540\n What is a zero day vulnerability?\n\n01:13.540 --> 01:16.800\n And then a zero day exploit or attack?\n\n01:18.080 --> 01:22.580\n So at the most basic level, let's say I'm a hacker\n\n01:22.580 --> 01:27.580\n and I find a bug in your iPhone iOS software\n\n01:28.020 --> 01:31.220\n that no one else knows about, especially Apple.\n\n01:31.220 --> 01:34.340\n That's called a zero day because the minute it's discovered,\n\n01:34.340 --> 01:36.520\n engineers have had zero days to fix it.\n\n01:37.720 --> 01:40.880\n If I can study that zero day,\n\n01:40.880 --> 01:44.900\n I could potentially write a program to exploit it.\n\n01:44.900 --> 01:48.820\n And that program would be called a zero day exploit.\n\n01:48.820 --> 01:53.820\n And for iOS, the dream is that you craft a zero day exploit\n\n01:54.260 --> 01:57.340\n that can remotely exploit someone else's iPhone\n\n01:57.340 --> 01:59.900\n without them ever knowing about it.\n\n01:59.900 --> 02:01.860\n And you can capture their location,\n\n02:01.860 --> 02:04.960\n you can capture their contacts\n\n02:04.960 --> 02:06.820\n that record their telephone calls,\n\n02:06.820 --> 02:09.580\n record their camera without them knowing about it.\n\n02:09.580 --> 02:13.200\n Basically, you can put an invisible ankle bracelet\n\n02:13.200 --> 02:15.020\n on someone without them knowing.\n\n02:15.020 --> 02:17.180\n And you can see why that capability,\n\n02:17.180 --> 02:20.460\n that zero day exploit would have immense value\n\n02:20.460 --> 02:23.700\n for a spy agency or a government\n\n02:23.700 --> 02:27.660\n that wants to monitor its critics or dissidents.\n\n02:27.660 --> 02:30.560\n And so there's a very lucrative market now\n\n02:30.560 --> 02:32.060\n for zero day exploits.\n\n02:32.060 --> 02:33.420\n So you said a few things there.\n\n02:33.420 --> 02:37.640\n One is iOS, why iOS, which operating system,\n\n02:37.640 --> 02:40.180\n which one is the sexier thing to try to get to\n\n02:40.180 --> 02:42.700\n or the most impactful thing?\n\n02:42.700 --> 02:45.460\n And the other thing you mentioned is remote\n\n02:45.460 --> 02:47.720\n versus like having to actually come\n\n02:47.720 --> 02:49.300\n in physical contact with it.\n\n02:49.300 --> 02:50.860\n Is that the distinction?\n\n02:50.860 --> 02:54.500\n So iPhone exploits have just been\n\n02:54.500 --> 02:58.240\n a government's number one priority.\n\n02:58.240 --> 03:00.580\n Recently, actually the price\n\n03:00.580 --> 03:03.500\n of an Android remote zero day exploit,\n\n03:03.500 --> 03:06.540\n something that can get you into Android phones\n\n03:06.540 --> 03:08.100\n is actually higher.\n\n03:08.100 --> 03:10.960\n The value of that is now higher on this underground market\n\n03:10.960 --> 03:15.360\n for zero day exploits than an iPhone iOS exploit.\n\n03:15.360 --> 03:16.700\n So things are changing.\n\n03:16.700 --> 03:20.040\n So there's probably more Android devices,\n\n03:20.040 --> 03:21.740\n so that's why it's better.\n\n03:21.740 --> 03:23.220\n But then the iPhone side,\n\n03:24.380 --> 03:26.160\n so I'm an Android person,\n\n03:26.160 --> 03:28.300\n because I'm a man of the people.\n\n03:28.300 --> 03:31.140\n But it seems like all the elites use iPhone,\n\n03:31.140 --> 03:33.020\n all the people at nice dinner parties.\n\n03:33.020 --> 03:37.260\n So is that the reason that the more powerful people\n\n03:37.260 --> 03:38.780\n use iPhones, is that why?\n\n03:38.780 --> 03:39.780\n I don't think so.\n\n03:39.780 --> 03:42.460\n I actually, so it was about two years ago\n\n03:42.460 --> 03:43.660\n that the prices flipped.\n\n03:43.660 --> 03:46.740\n It used to be that if you could craft\n\n03:46.740 --> 03:51.740\n a remote zero click exploit for iOS,\n\n03:53.340 --> 03:55.420\n then that was about as good as it gets.\n\n03:55.420 --> 04:00.420\n You could sell that to a zero day broker for $2 million.\n\n04:01.740 --> 04:04.700\n The caveat is you can never tell anyone about it,\n\n04:04.700 --> 04:07.180\n because the minute you tell someone about it,\n\n04:07.180 --> 04:08.880\n Apple learns about it,\n\n04:08.880 --> 04:12.540\n they patch it in that $2.5 million investment\n\n04:12.540 --> 04:16.100\n that that zero day broker just made goes to dust.\n\n04:16.100 --> 04:18.980\n So a couple of years ago,\n\n04:18.980 --> 04:20.780\n and don't quote me on the prices,\n\n04:20.780 --> 04:25.780\n but an Android zero click remote exploit\n\n04:25.900 --> 04:29.020\n for the first time topped the iOS.\n\n04:29.020 --> 04:32.180\n And actually a lot of people's read on that\n\n04:32.180 --> 04:35.860\n was that it might be a sign\n\n04:35.860 --> 04:40.260\n that Apple security was falling,\n\n04:40.260 --> 04:43.060\n and that it might actually be easier\n\n04:43.060 --> 04:46.700\n to find an iOS zero day exploit\n\n04:46.700 --> 04:48.940\n than find an Android zero day exploit.\n\n04:48.940 --> 04:51.140\n The other thing is market share.\n\n04:51.140 --> 04:54.700\n There are just more people around the world that use Android.\n\n04:54.700 --> 04:58.540\n And a lot of governments that are paying top dollar\n\n04:58.540 --> 05:01.320\n for zero day exploits these days\n\n05:01.320 --> 05:05.260\n are deep pocketed governments in the Gulf\n\n05:05.260 --> 05:06.940\n that wanna use these exploits\n\n05:06.940 --> 05:10.780\n to monitor their own citizens, monitor their critics.\n\n05:10.780 --> 05:12.380\n And so it's not necessarily\n\n05:12.380 --> 05:14.620\n that they're trying to find elites,\n\n05:14.620 --> 05:17.260\n it's that they wanna find out who these people are\n\n05:17.260 --> 05:18.500\n that are criticizing them\n\n05:18.500 --> 05:21.180\n or perhaps planning the next Arab Spring.\n\n05:21.180 --> 05:23.260\n So in your experience,\n\n05:23.260 --> 05:24.940\n are most of these attacks targeted\n\n05:24.940 --> 05:26.500\n to cover a large population,\n\n05:26.500 --> 05:29.100\n or is there attacks that are targeted\n\n05:29.100 --> 05:31.300\n towards specific individuals?\n\n05:31.300 --> 05:32.740\n So I think it's both.\n\n05:32.740 --> 05:36.980\n Some of the zero day exploits that have fetched top dollar\n\n05:36.980 --> 05:39.340\n that I've heard of in my reporting in the United States\n\n05:39.340 --> 05:41.260\n were highly targeted.\n\n05:41.260 --> 05:43.640\n There was a potential terrorist attack.\n\n05:43.640 --> 05:45.460\n They wanted to get into this person's phone.\n\n05:45.460 --> 05:48.060\n It had to be done in the next 24 hours.\n\n05:48.060 --> 05:50.860\n They approached hackers and say, we'll pay you\n\n05:50.860 --> 05:53.780\n X millions of dollars if you can do this.\n\n05:53.780 --> 05:55.820\n But then you look at,\n\n05:55.820 --> 06:00.740\n when we've discovered iOS zero day exploits in the wild,\n\n06:00.740 --> 06:03.660\n some of them have been targeting large populations\n\n06:03.660 --> 06:05.240\n like Uyghurs.\n\n06:05.240 --> 06:07.060\n So a couple of years ago,\n\n06:07.060 --> 06:10.260\n there was a watering hole attack.\n\n06:10.260 --> 06:12.140\n Okay, what's a watering hole attack?\n\n06:12.140 --> 06:13.260\n There's a website,\n\n06:13.260 --> 06:17.860\n it was actually had information aimed at Uyghurs\n\n06:17.860 --> 06:20.960\n and you could access it all over the world.\n\n06:20.960 --> 06:23.260\n And if you visited this website,\n\n06:24.140 --> 06:29.140\n it would drop an iOS zero day exploit onto your phone.\n\n06:29.140 --> 06:32.220\n And so anyone that visited this website\n\n06:32.220 --> 06:34.460\n that was about Uyghurs anywhere,\n\n06:34.460 --> 06:37.400\n I mean, Uyghurs, Uyghurs living abroad,\n\n06:37.400 --> 06:42.060\n basically the Uyghur diaspora would have gotten infected\n\n06:42.060 --> 06:43.940\n with this zero day exploit.\n\n06:43.940 --> 06:48.940\n So in that case, they were targeting huge swaths\n\n06:49.200 --> 06:51.720\n of this one population or people interested\n\n06:51.720 --> 06:54.780\n in this one population, basically in real time.\n\n06:54.780 --> 06:59.340\n So who are these attackers?\n\n06:59.340 --> 07:02.660\n From the individual level to the group level,\n\n07:02.660 --> 07:05.180\n psychologically speaking, what's their motivation?\n\n07:05.180 --> 07:07.420\n Is it purely money?\n\n07:07.420 --> 07:09.220\n Is it the challenge?\n\n07:09.220 --> 07:10.620\n Are they malevolent?\n\n07:10.620 --> 07:12.220\n Is it power?\n\n07:12.220 --> 07:15.460\n These are big philosophical human questions, I guess.\n\n07:15.460 --> 07:20.380\n So these are the questions I set out to answer for my book.\n\n07:20.380 --> 07:25.380\n I wanted to know, are these people that are just after money?\n\n07:26.900 --> 07:29.680\n If they're just after money, how do they sleep at night?\n\n07:29.680 --> 07:31.900\n Not knowing whether that zero day exploit\n\n07:31.900 --> 07:34.720\n they just sold to a broker is being used\n\n07:34.720 --> 07:38.140\n to basically make someone's life a living hell.\n\n07:38.140 --> 07:41.820\n And what I found was there's kind of this long sorted history\n\n07:41.820 --> 07:43.660\n to this question.\n\n07:43.660 --> 07:46.900\n It started out in the 80s and 90s\n\n07:46.900 --> 07:51.180\n when hackers were just finding holes and bugs and software\n\n07:51.180 --> 07:54.340\n for curiosity's sake, really as a hobby.\n\n07:54.340 --> 07:56.780\n And some of them would go to the tech companies\n\n07:56.780 --> 08:01.740\n like Microsoft or Sun Microsystems at the time or Oracle.\n\n08:01.740 --> 08:04.500\n And they'd say, hey, I just found this zero day\n\n08:04.500 --> 08:08.100\n in your software and I can use it to break into NASA.\n\n08:08.100 --> 08:11.180\n And the general response at the time wasn't,\n\n08:11.180 --> 08:13.940\n thank you so much for pointing out this flaw\n\n08:13.940 --> 08:17.260\n and our software, we'll get it fixed as soon as possible.\n\n08:17.260 --> 08:21.220\n It was, don't ever poke around our software ever again\n\n08:21.220 --> 08:24.180\n or we'll stick our general counsel on you.\n\n08:24.180 --> 08:29.180\n And that was really sort of the common thread for years.\n\n08:30.380 --> 08:34.420\n And so hackers who set out to do the right thing\n\n08:34.420 --> 08:37.640\n were basically told to shut up\n\n08:37.640 --> 08:40.140\n and stop doing what you're doing.\n\n08:40.140 --> 08:44.900\n And what happened next was they basically started trading\n\n08:44.900 --> 08:46.220\n this information online.\n\n08:46.220 --> 08:48.180\n Now, when you go back and interview people\n\n08:48.180 --> 08:53.020\n from those early days, they all tell a very similar story,\n\n08:53.020 --> 08:57.520\n which is they're curious, they're tinkerers.\n\n08:57.520 --> 08:59.740\n They remind me of like the kid down the block\n\n08:59.740 --> 09:03.780\n that was constantly poking around the hood of his dad's car.\n\n09:03.780 --> 09:06.140\n They just couldn't help themselves.\n\n09:06.140 --> 09:09.500\n They wanted to figure out how a system is designed\n\n09:09.500 --> 09:11.900\n and how they could potentially exploit it\n\n09:11.900 --> 09:13.120\n for some other purpose.\n\n09:13.120 --> 09:14.960\n It doesn't have to be good or bad.\n\n09:15.820 --> 09:20.660\n But they were basically kind of beat down for so long\n\n09:20.660 --> 09:22.980\n by these big tech companies\n\n09:22.980 --> 09:26.640\n that they started just silently trading them\n\n09:26.640 --> 09:28.100\n with other hackers.\n\n09:28.100 --> 09:32.660\n And that's how you got these really heated debates\n\n09:32.660 --> 09:34.800\n in the 90s about disclosure.\n\n09:35.780 --> 09:38.200\n Should you just dump these things online\n\n09:38.200 --> 09:40.360\n because any script kitty can pick them up\n\n09:40.360 --> 09:42.600\n and use it for all kinds of mischief.\n\n09:43.540 --> 09:46.140\n But don't you wanna just stick a middle finger\n\n09:46.140 --> 09:47.300\n to all these companies\n\n09:47.300 --> 09:50.060\n that are basically threatening you all the time.\n\n09:50.060 --> 09:53.620\n So there was this really interesting dynamic at play.\n\n09:53.620 --> 09:57.100\n And what I learned in the course of doing my book\n\n09:57.100 --> 10:01.740\n was that government agencies and their contractors\n\n10:01.740 --> 10:06.020\n sort of tapped into that frustration and that resentment.\n\n10:06.020 --> 10:09.140\n And they started quietly reaching out to hackers\n\n10:09.140 --> 10:11.120\n on these forums.\n\n10:11.120 --> 10:13.860\n And they said, hey, you know that zero day\n\n10:13.860 --> 10:14.940\n you just dropped online,\n\n10:14.940 --> 10:17.980\n could you come up with something custom for me?\n\n10:17.980 --> 10:20.060\n And I'll pay you six figures for it\n\n10:20.060 --> 10:22.280\n so long as you shut up and never tell anyone\n\n10:22.280 --> 10:24.740\n that I paid you for this.\n\n10:24.740 --> 10:27.060\n And that's what happened.\n\n10:27.060 --> 10:28.420\n So throughout the 90s,\n\n10:28.420 --> 10:31.460\n there was a bunch of boutique contractors\n\n10:31.460 --> 10:34.680\n that started reaching out to hackers on these forums\n\n10:34.680 --> 10:37.340\n and saying, hey, I'll pay you six figures\n\n10:37.340 --> 10:39.640\n for that bug you were trying to get Microsoft\n\n10:39.640 --> 10:41.420\n to fix for free.\n\n10:41.420 --> 10:45.560\n And sort of so began or so catalyzed this market\n\n10:45.560 --> 10:48.020\n where governments and their intermediaries\n\n10:48.020 --> 10:50.420\n started reaching out to these hackers\n\n10:50.420 --> 10:53.060\n and buying their bugs for free.\n\n10:53.060 --> 10:54.180\n And in those early days,\n\n10:54.180 --> 10:57.620\n I think a lot of it was just for quiet counterintelligence,\n\n10:57.620 --> 11:00.040\n traditional espionage.\n\n11:00.040 --> 11:04.260\n But as we started baking the software,\n\n11:04.260 --> 11:07.060\n Windows software, Schneider Electric,\n\n11:07.060 --> 11:11.300\n Siemens industrial software into our nuclear plants\n\n11:11.300 --> 11:14.940\n and our factories and our power grid\n\n11:14.940 --> 11:18.700\n and our petrochemical facilities and our pipelines,\n\n11:18.700 --> 11:22.060\n those same zero days came to be just as valuable\n\n11:22.060 --> 11:25.120\n for sabotage and war planning.\n\n11:25.120 --> 11:27.220\n Does the fact that the market sprung up\n\n11:27.220 --> 11:28.480\n and you can now make a lot of money\n\n11:28.480 --> 11:31.820\n change the nature of the attackers that came to the table\n\n11:31.820 --> 11:34.500\n or grow the number of attackers?\n\n11:34.500 --> 11:35.700\n I mean, what is, I guess,\n\n11:35.700 --> 11:40.540\n you told the psychology of the hackers in the 90s,\n\n11:40.540 --> 11:43.980\n what is the culture today and where is it heading?\n\n11:43.980 --> 11:47.100\n So I think there are people who will tell you\n\n11:47.100 --> 11:49.060\n they would never sell a zero day\n\n11:49.060 --> 11:52.060\n to a zero day broker or a government.\n\n11:52.060 --> 11:54.540\n One, because they don't know how it's gonna get used\n\n11:54.540 --> 11:56.340\n when they throw it over the fence.\n\n11:56.340 --> 11:58.780\n Most of these get rolled into classified programs\n\n11:58.780 --> 12:01.260\n and you don't know how they get used.\n\n12:01.260 --> 12:02.700\n If you sell it to a zero day broker,\n\n12:02.700 --> 12:05.500\n you don't even know which nation state might use it\n\n12:06.900 --> 12:09.300\n or potentially which criminal group might use it\n\n12:09.300 --> 12:11.380\n if you sell it on the dark web.\n\n12:11.380 --> 12:15.400\n The other thing that they say is that\n\n12:15.400 --> 12:17.980\n they wanna be able to sleep at night.\n\n12:17.980 --> 12:19.900\n And they lose a lot of sleep\n\n12:19.900 --> 12:22.140\n if they found out their zero day was being used\n\n12:22.140 --> 12:24.820\n to make a dissident's life living hell.\n\n12:25.980 --> 12:28.500\n But there are a lot of people, good people,\n\n12:28.500 --> 12:32.620\n who also say, no, this is not my problem.\n\n12:32.620 --> 12:35.380\n This is the technology company's problem.\n\n12:35.380 --> 12:37.020\n If they weren't writing new bugs\n\n12:37.020 --> 12:39.160\n into their software every day,\n\n12:39.160 --> 12:41.060\n then there wouldn't be a market.\n\n12:41.060 --> 12:42.860\n Then there wouldn't be a problem.\n\n12:42.860 --> 12:44.780\n But they continue to write bugs\n\n12:44.780 --> 12:46.180\n into their software all the time\n\n12:46.180 --> 12:48.300\n and they continue to profit off that software.\n\n12:48.300 --> 12:53.300\n So why shouldn't I profit off my labor too?\n\n12:53.540 --> 12:55.740\n And one of the things that has happened,\n\n12:55.740 --> 12:57.980\n which is I think a positive development\n\n12:57.980 --> 13:02.260\n over the last 10 years, are bug bounty programs.\n\n13:02.260 --> 13:05.020\n Companies like Google and Facebook\n\n13:05.020 --> 13:07.460\n and then Microsoft and finally Apple,\n\n13:07.460 --> 13:10.180\n which resisted it for a really long time,\n\n13:10.180 --> 13:14.780\n have said, okay, we are gonna shift our perspective\n\n13:14.780 --> 13:15.700\n about hackers.\n\n13:15.700 --> 13:18.960\n We're no longer going to treat them as the enemy here.\n\n13:18.960 --> 13:20.340\n We're going to start paying them\n\n13:20.340 --> 13:23.800\n for what it's essentially free quality assurance.\n\n13:23.800 --> 13:26.800\n And we're gonna pay them good money in some cases,\n\n13:26.800 --> 13:28.900\n six figures in some cases.\n\n13:28.900 --> 13:32.380\n We're never gonna be able to bid against a zero day broker\n\n13:32.380 --> 13:34.740\n who sells to government agencies.\n\n13:34.740 --> 13:38.900\n But we can reward them and hopefully get to that bug earlier\n\n13:38.900 --> 13:40.980\n where we can neutralize it\n\n13:40.980 --> 13:43.060\n so that they don't have to spend another year\n\n13:43.060 --> 13:44.760\n developing the zero day exploit.\n\n13:44.760 --> 13:48.180\n And in that way, we can keep our software more secure.\n\n13:48.180 --> 13:53.060\n But every week I get messages from some hacker that says,\n\n13:53.060 --> 13:55.940\n you know, I tried to see this zero day exploit\n\n13:55.940 --> 13:58.020\n that was just found in the wild,\n\n13:58.020 --> 14:00.380\n being used by this nation state.\n\n14:00.380 --> 14:04.560\n I tried to tell Microsoft about this two years ago\n\n14:04.560 --> 14:08.900\n and they were gonna pay me peanuts so it never got fixed.\n\n14:08.900 --> 14:12.700\n There are all sorts of those stories that can continue on.\n\n14:12.700 --> 14:16.700\n And I think just generally,\n\n14:16.700 --> 14:19.860\n hackers are not very good at diplomacy.\n\n14:19.860 --> 14:24.620\n They tend to be pretty snipey, technical crowd.\n\n14:24.620 --> 14:28.220\n And very philosophical in my experience.\n\n14:28.220 --> 14:31.860\n But diplomacy is not their strong suit.\n\n14:31.860 --> 14:33.660\n Oh, there almost has to be a broker\n\n14:33.660 --> 14:35.940\n between companies and hackers.\n\n14:35.940 --> 14:37.980\n We can translate effectively,\n\n14:37.980 --> 14:39.540\n just like you have a zero day broker\n\n14:39.540 --> 14:41.740\n between governments and hackers.\n\n14:41.740 --> 14:43.100\n You have to speak their language.\n\n14:43.100 --> 14:45.900\n Yeah, and there have been some of those companies\n\n14:45.900 --> 14:47.780\n who've risen up to meet that demand.\n\n14:47.780 --> 14:50.340\n And HackerOne is one of them.\n\n14:50.340 --> 14:52.440\n Bugcrowd is another.\n\n14:52.440 --> 14:55.180\n Cynak has an interesting model, so that's a company\n\n14:55.180 --> 14:59.900\n that you pay for a private bug bounty program essentially.\n\n14:59.900 --> 15:04.460\n So you pay this company, they tap hackers all over the world\n\n15:04.460 --> 15:07.580\n to come hack your software, hack your system.\n\n15:07.580 --> 15:10.840\n And then they'll quietly tell you what they found.\n\n15:10.840 --> 15:13.740\n And I think that's a really positive development.\n\n15:13.740 --> 15:16.300\n And actually, the Department of Defense\n\n15:16.300 --> 15:20.480\n hired all three of those companies I just mentioned\n\n15:20.480 --> 15:22.020\n to help secure their systems.\n\n15:22.020 --> 15:24.180\n Now I think they're still a little timid\n\n15:24.180 --> 15:25.820\n in terms of letting those hackers\n\n15:25.820 --> 15:30.300\n into the really sensitive, high side classified stuff.\n\n15:30.300 --> 15:32.060\n But you know, baby steps.\n\n15:33.100 --> 15:34.740\n Just to understand what you were saying,\n\n15:34.740 --> 15:37.780\n you think it's impossible for companies\n\n15:37.780 --> 15:40.540\n to financially compete with the zero day brokers,\n\n15:40.540 --> 15:42.020\n with governments.\n\n15:42.020 --> 15:47.020\n So like the defense can't outpay the hackers?\n\n15:47.740 --> 15:51.860\n It's interesting, they shouldn't outpay them.\n\n15:51.860 --> 15:53.900\n Because what would happen\n\n15:53.900 --> 15:58.900\n if they started offering $2.5 million at Apple\n\n15:59.220 --> 16:02.300\n for any zero day exploit\n\n16:02.300 --> 16:04.700\n that governments would pay that much for,\n\n16:04.700 --> 16:06.340\n is their own engineers would say,\n\n16:06.340 --> 16:10.280\n why the hell am I working for less than that\n\n16:10.280 --> 16:12.400\n and doing my nine to five every day?\n\n16:12.400 --> 16:14.700\n So you would create a perverse incentive.\n\n16:14.700 --> 16:18.480\n And I didn't think about that until I started this research\n\n16:18.480 --> 16:20.500\n and I realized, okay, yeah, that makes sense.\n\n16:20.500 --> 16:25.300\n You don't want to incentivize offense so much\n\n16:25.300 --> 16:27.260\n that it's to your own detriment.\n\n16:27.260 --> 16:29.540\n And so I think what they have though,\n\n16:29.540 --> 16:32.660\n what the companies have on government agencies,\n\n16:32.660 --> 16:36.140\n is if they pay you, you get to talk about it.\n\n16:36.140 --> 16:38.180\n You know, you get the street cred.\n\n16:38.180 --> 16:41.260\n You get to brag about the fact you just found\n\n16:41.260 --> 16:45.340\n that $2.5 million, you know, iOS zero day\n\n16:45.340 --> 16:47.100\n that no one else did.\n\n16:47.100 --> 16:48.780\n And if you sell it to a broker,\n\n16:48.780 --> 16:50.100\n you never get to talk about it.\n\n16:50.100 --> 16:52.300\n And I think that really does eat at people.\n\n16:53.180 --> 16:55.100\n Can I ask you a big philosophical question\n\n16:55.100 --> 16:56.460\n about human nature here?\n\n16:57.300 --> 17:00.780\n So if you have, I mean, what you've seen,\n\n17:00.780 --> 17:03.420\n if a human being has a zero day,\n\n17:03.420 --> 17:08.420\n they found a zero day vulnerability that can hack into,\n\n17:09.300 --> 17:11.980\n I don't know, what's the worst thing you can hack into?\n\n17:11.980 --> 17:14.900\n Something that could launch nuclear weapons.\n\n17:14.900 --> 17:16.980\n Which percentage of the people in the world\n\n17:16.980 --> 17:20.620\n that have the skill would not share that with anyone,\n\n17:20.620 --> 17:23.420\n with any bad party?\n\n17:23.420 --> 17:27.740\n I guess how many people are completely devoid\n\n17:27.740 --> 17:31.740\n of ethical concerns in your sense?\n\n17:31.740 --> 17:36.340\n So my belief is all the ultra competent people\n\n17:36.340 --> 17:39.580\n or very, very high percentage of ultra competent people\n\n17:39.580 --> 17:41.540\n are also ethical people.\n\n17:41.540 --> 17:42.940\n That's been my experience.\n\n17:42.940 --> 17:45.860\n But then again, my experience is narrow.\n\n17:45.860 --> 17:48.500\n What's your experience been like?\n\n17:48.500 --> 17:52.620\n So this was another question I wanted to answer.\n\n17:53.620 --> 17:57.740\n Who are these people who would sell a zero day exploit\n\n17:57.740 --> 18:01.420\n that would neutralize a Schneider Electric safety lock\n\n18:01.420 --> 18:03.100\n at a petrochemical plant?\n\n18:03.100 --> 18:05.380\n Basically the last thing you would need to neutralize\n\n18:05.380 --> 18:07.980\n before you trigger some kind of explosion.\n\n18:07.980 --> 18:09.100\n Who would sell that?\n\n18:11.300 --> 18:14.140\n And I got my answer,\n\n18:14.140 --> 18:16.740\n well, the answer was different.\n\n18:16.740 --> 18:19.820\n A lot of people said, I would never even look there\n\n18:19.820 --> 18:21.020\n because I don't even wanna know.\n\n18:21.020 --> 18:22.980\n I don't even wanna have that capability.\n\n18:22.980 --> 18:26.540\n I don't even wanna have to make that decision\n\n18:26.540 --> 18:29.900\n about whether I'm gonna profit off of that knowledge.\n\n18:29.900 --> 18:31.780\n I went down to Argentina\n\n18:31.780 --> 18:36.780\n and this whole kind of moral calculus I had in my head\n\n18:36.940 --> 18:39.220\n was completely flipped around.\n\n18:39.220 --> 18:41.580\n So just to back up for a moment.\n\n18:41.580 --> 18:46.420\n So Argentina actually is a real hacker's paradise.\n\n18:47.500 --> 18:50.740\n People grew up in Argentina and I went down there,\n\n18:50.740 --> 18:54.180\n I guess I was there around 2015, 2016,\n\n18:54.180 --> 18:56.540\n but you still couldn't get an iPhone.\n\n18:57.420 --> 18:58.860\n They didn't have Amazon Prime.\n\n18:58.860 --> 19:00.780\n You couldn't get access to any of the apps\n\n19:00.780 --> 19:02.540\n we all take for granted.\n\n19:02.540 --> 19:05.220\n To get those things in Argentina as a kid,\n\n19:05.220 --> 19:07.540\n you have to find a way to hack them.\n\n19:07.540 --> 19:12.020\n And the whole culture is really like a hacker culture.\n\n19:12.020 --> 19:15.220\n They say it's really like a MacGyver culture.\n\n19:15.220 --> 19:17.540\n You have to figure out how to break into something\n\n19:17.540 --> 19:19.420\n with wire and tape.\n\n19:19.420 --> 19:24.380\n And that means that there are a lot of really good hackers\n\n19:24.380 --> 19:29.380\n in Argentina who specialize in developing zero to exploits.\n\n19:30.500 --> 19:33.980\n And I went down to this Argentina conference\n\n19:33.980 --> 19:35.700\n called Echo Party.\n\n19:35.700 --> 19:39.420\n And I asked the organizer, okay, can you introduce me\n\n19:39.420 --> 19:43.020\n to someone who's selling zero to exploits to governments?\n\n19:43.020 --> 19:44.940\n And he was like, just throw a stone.\n\n19:46.340 --> 19:48.860\n Throw a stone anywhere and you're gonna hit someone.\n\n19:48.860 --> 19:52.100\n And all over this conference, you saw these guys\n\n19:52.100 --> 19:54.060\n who were clearly from these Gulf States\n\n19:54.060 --> 19:55.620\n who only spoke Arabic.\n\n19:55.620 --> 19:59.300\n What are they doing at a young hacking conference\n\n19:59.300 --> 20:01.060\n in Buenos Aires?\n\n20:01.060 --> 20:05.100\n And so I went out to lunch with kind of this godfather\n\n20:05.100 --> 20:07.260\n of the hacking scene there.\n\n20:07.260 --> 20:10.180\n And I asked this really dumb question\n\n20:10.180 --> 20:13.100\n and I'm still embarrassed about how I phrased it.\n\n20:13.100 --> 20:16.540\n But I said, so will these guys only sell\n\n20:16.540 --> 20:20.300\n these zero to exploits to good Western governments?\n\n20:20.300 --> 20:22.300\n And he said, Nicole, last time I checked,\n\n20:22.300 --> 20:25.820\n the United States wasn't a good Western government.\n\n20:25.820 --> 20:28.180\n The last country that bombed another country\n\n20:28.180 --> 20:31.820\n into oblivion wasn't China or Iran,\n\n20:31.820 --> 20:33.540\n it was the United States.\n\n20:33.540 --> 20:36.700\n So if we're gonna go by your whole moral calculus,\n\n20:36.700 --> 20:39.580\n just know that we have a very different calculus down here\n\n20:39.580 --> 20:44.180\n and we'd actually rather sell to Iran or Russia\n\n20:44.180 --> 20:46.580\n or China maybe than the United States.\n\n20:46.580 --> 20:48.820\n And that just blew me away.\n\n20:48.820 --> 20:51.820\n Like, wow, he's like, we'll just sell\n\n20:51.820 --> 20:53.900\n to whoever brings us the biggest bag of cash.\n\n20:53.900 --> 20:57.900\n Have you checked into our inflation situation recently?\n\n20:57.900 --> 21:02.500\n So I had some of those like reality checks along the way.\n\n21:02.500 --> 21:05.980\n We tend to think of things as is this moral,\n\n21:05.980 --> 21:08.780\n is this ethical, especially as journalists.\n\n21:08.780 --> 21:11.020\n And we kind of sit on our high horse sometimes\n\n21:11.020 --> 21:13.640\n and write about a lot of things\n\n21:13.640 --> 21:16.360\n that seem to push the moral bounds.\n\n21:16.360 --> 21:18.700\n But in this market, which is essentially\n\n21:18.700 --> 21:22.820\n an underground market that the one rule is like fight club.\n\n21:22.820 --> 21:24.420\n No one talks about fight club.\n\n21:24.420 --> 21:25.920\n First rule of the zero day market,\n\n21:25.920 --> 21:29.200\n nobody talks about the zero day market on both sides\n\n21:29.200 --> 21:30.900\n because the hacker doesn't wanna lose\n\n21:30.900 --> 21:33.900\n their $2.5 million bounty.\n\n21:33.900 --> 21:36.840\n And governments roll these into classified programs\n\n21:36.840 --> 21:39.160\n and they don't want anyone to know what they have.\n\n21:39.160 --> 21:41.180\n So no one talks about this thing.\n\n21:41.180 --> 21:43.820\n And when you're operating in the dark like that,\n\n21:43.820 --> 21:46.980\n it's really easy to put aside your morals sometimes.\n\n21:48.500 --> 21:52.020\n Can I, as a small tangent, ask you, by way of advice,\n\n21:52.020 --> 21:55.540\n you must have done some incredible interviews.\n\n21:55.540 --> 21:58.280\n And you've also spoken about how serious\n\n21:58.280 --> 22:01.420\n you take protecting your sources.\n\n22:01.420 --> 22:04.420\n If you were to give me advice for interviewing\n\n22:04.420 --> 22:08.000\n when you're recording on mic with a video camera,\n\n22:10.220 --> 22:13.060\n how is it possible to get into this world?\n\n22:13.060 --> 22:16.080\n Like is it basically impossible?\n\n22:16.080 --> 22:19.020\n So you've spoken with a few people,\n\n22:19.020 --> 22:23.300\n what is it like the godfather of cyber war, cyber security?\n\n22:23.300 --> 22:25.220\n So people that are already out.\n\n22:25.220 --> 22:28.400\n And they still have to be pretty brave to speak publicly.\n\n22:29.820 --> 22:32.700\n But is it virtually impossible to really talk to anybody\n\n22:32.700 --> 22:34.580\n who is a current hacker?\n\n22:34.580 --> 22:37.700\n Are you always like 10, 20 years behind?\n\n22:37.700 --> 22:38.700\n It's a good question.\n\n22:38.700 --> 22:40.820\n And this is why I'm a print journalist.\n\n22:41.900 --> 22:45.900\n But when I've seen people do it,\n\n22:45.900 --> 22:49.220\n it's always the guy who's behind the shadows,\n\n22:49.220 --> 22:51.780\n whose voice has been altered.\n\n22:51.780 --> 22:53.380\n When they've gotten someone on camera,\n\n22:53.380 --> 22:55.120\n that's usually how they do it.\n\n22:56.740 --> 22:58.980\n Very, very few people talk in this space.\n\n22:58.980 --> 23:02.020\n And there's actually a pretty well known case study\n\n23:02.020 --> 23:04.420\n in why you don't talk publicly in this space\n\n23:04.420 --> 23:05.860\n and you don't get photographed.\n\n23:05.860 --> 23:07.380\n And that's the gruck.\n\n23:07.380 --> 23:12.060\n So the gruck is or was this zero day broker,\n\n23:12.060 --> 23:15.220\n South African guy, lives in Thailand.\n\n23:15.220 --> 23:18.840\n And right when I was starting on this subject\n\n23:18.840 --> 23:22.680\n at the New York Times, he'd given an interview to Forbes.\n\n23:22.680 --> 23:25.540\n And he talked about being a zero day broker.\n\n23:25.540 --> 23:29.140\n And he even posed next to this giant duffel bag\n\n23:29.140 --> 23:31.700\n filled with cash, ostensibly.\n\n23:31.700 --> 23:35.460\n And later he would say he was speaking off the record.\n\n23:35.460 --> 23:38.000\n He didn't understand the rules of the game.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:41.000\n But what I heard from people who did business with him\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:43.080\n was that the minute that that story came out,\n\n23:43.080 --> 23:45.280\n he became PNG'd.\n\n23:45.280 --> 23:47.540\n No one did business with him.\n\n23:47.540 --> 23:50.060\n His business plummeted by at least half.\n\n23:50.060 --> 23:52.100\n No one wants to do business with anyone\n\n23:52.100 --> 23:54.180\n who's going to get on camera and talk\n\n23:54.180 --> 23:58.180\n about how they're selling zero days to governments.\n\n23:58.180 --> 23:59.700\n It puts you at danger.\n\n23:59.700 --> 24:01.620\n And I did hear that he got some visits\n\n24:01.620 --> 24:04.020\n from some security folks.\n\n24:04.020 --> 24:06.940\n And that's another thing for these people to consider.\n\n24:06.940 --> 24:12.300\n If they have those zero day exploits at their disposal,\n\n24:12.300 --> 24:16.400\n they become a huge target for nation states\n\n24:16.400 --> 24:18.460\n all over the world.\n\n24:18.460 --> 24:20.780\n Talk about having perfect opsec.\n\n24:20.780 --> 24:23.540\n You better have some perfect opsec\n\n24:23.540 --> 24:26.300\n if people know that you have access to those zero day\n\n24:26.300 --> 24:27.860\n exploits.\n\n24:27.860 --> 24:33.500\n Which sucks because, I mean, transparency here\n\n24:33.500 --> 24:36.380\n would be really powerful for educating the world\n\n24:36.380 --> 24:40.100\n and also inspiring other engineers to do good.\n\n24:40.100 --> 24:43.820\n It just feels like when you operate in the shadows,\n\n24:43.820 --> 24:46.720\n it doesn't help us move in the positive direction in terms\n\n24:46.720 --> 24:48.900\n of getting more people on the defense side\n\n24:48.900 --> 24:50.620\n versus on the attack side.\n\n24:50.620 --> 24:52.060\n But of course, what can you do?\n\n24:52.060 --> 24:53.660\n I mean, the best you can possibly do\n\n24:53.660 --> 24:57.060\n is have great journalists, just like you did,\n\n24:57.060 --> 24:58.900\n interview and write books about it,\n\n24:58.900 --> 25:01.020\n and integrate the information you get\n\n25:01.020 --> 25:02.900\n while hiding the sources.\n\n25:02.900 --> 25:07.860\n Yeah, and I think what HackerOne has told me was, OK,\n\n25:07.860 --> 25:09.340\n let's just put away the people that\n\n25:09.340 --> 25:13.980\n are finding and developing zero day exploits all day long.\n\n25:13.980 --> 25:15.540\n Let's put that aside.\n\n25:15.540 --> 25:19.620\n What about however many millions of programmers\n\n25:19.620 --> 25:22.340\n all over the world who've never even heard of a zero day\n\n25:22.340 --> 25:23.300\n exploit?\n\n25:23.300 --> 25:26.620\n Why not tap into them and say, hey, we'll\n\n25:26.620 --> 25:31.540\n start paying you if you can find a bug in United Airlines\n\n25:31.540 --> 25:36.900\n software or in Schneider Electric or in Ford or Tesla?\n\n25:36.900 --> 25:39.940\n And I think that is a really smart approach.\n\n25:39.940 --> 25:43.900\n Let's go find this untapped army of programmers\n\n25:43.900 --> 25:47.780\n to neutralize these bugs before the people who will continue\n\n25:47.780 --> 25:50.820\n to sell these to governments can find them and exploit them.\n\n25:50.820 --> 25:53.180\n OK, I have to ask you about this.\n\n25:53.180 --> 25:55.740\n From a personal side, it's funny enough,\n\n25:55.740 --> 25:59.260\n after we agreed to talk, I've gotten,\n\n25:59.260 --> 26:03.700\n for the first time in my life, was a victim of a cyber attack.\n\n26:06.380 --> 26:07.500\n So this is ransomware.\n\n26:07.500 --> 26:08.540\n It's called Deadbolt.\n\n26:08.540 --> 26:10.020\n People can look it up.\n\n26:10.020 --> 26:14.140\n I have a QNAP device for basically kind\n\n26:14.140 --> 26:15.580\n of coldish storage.\n\n26:15.580 --> 26:20.300\n So it's about 60 terabytes with 50 terabytes of data on it\n\n26:20.300 --> 26:21.700\n in RAID 5.\n\n26:21.700 --> 26:27.100\n And apparently, about 4,000 to 5,000 QNAP devices\n\n26:27.100 --> 26:30.660\n were hacked and taken over with this ransomware.\n\n26:30.660 --> 26:35.580\n And what ransomware does there is it goes file by file,\n\n26:35.580 --> 26:39.060\n almost all the files on the QNAP storage device,\n\n26:39.060 --> 26:40.420\n and encrypts them.\n\n26:40.420 --> 26:43.660\n And then there's this very eloquently and politely\n\n26:43.660 --> 26:48.300\n written page that pops up, describes what happened.\n\n26:48.300 --> 26:50.020\n All your files have been encrypted.\n\n26:50.020 --> 26:52.580\n This includes but is not limited to photos, documents,\n\n26:52.580 --> 26:53.780\n and spreadsheets.\n\n26:53.780 --> 26:56.180\n Why me?\n\n26:56.180 --> 26:57.940\n This is a lot of people commented\n\n26:57.940 --> 27:00.740\n about how friendly and eloquent this is.\n\n27:00.740 --> 27:01.780\n And I have to commend them.\n\n27:01.780 --> 27:05.980\n It is, and it's pretty user friendly.\n\n27:05.980 --> 27:06.580\n Why me?\n\n27:06.580 --> 27:08.060\n This is not a personal attack.\n\n27:08.060 --> 27:10.980\n You have been targeted because of the inadequate security\n\n27:10.980 --> 27:15.100\n provided by your vendor, QNAP.\n\n27:15.100 --> 27:16.380\n What now?\n\n27:16.380 --> 27:19.780\n You can make a payment of exactly 0.03 Bitcoin,\n\n27:19.780 --> 27:23.380\n which is about $1,000, to the following address.\n\n27:23.380 --> 27:25.020\n Once the payment has been made, we'll\n\n27:25.020 --> 27:27.500\n follow up with transaction to the same address,\n\n27:27.500 --> 27:28.580\n blah, blah, blah.\n\n27:28.580 --> 27:31.500\n They give you instructions of what happens next,\n\n27:31.500 --> 27:32.940\n and they'll give you a decryption key\n\n27:32.940 --> 27:34.620\n that you can then use.\n\n27:34.620 --> 27:38.860\n And then there's another message for QNAP that says,\n\n27:38.860 --> 27:41.220\n all your affected customers have been targeted using\n\n27:41.220 --> 27:43.860\n a zero day vulnerability in your product.\n\n27:43.860 --> 27:48.380\n We offer you two options to mitigate this and future damage.\n\n27:48.380 --> 27:51.700\n One, make a Bitcoin payment of 5 Bitcoin\n\n27:51.700 --> 27:54.260\n to the following address, and that\n\n27:54.260 --> 27:58.460\n will reveal to QNAP the, I'm summarizing things here,\n\n27:58.460 --> 28:00.180\n what the actual vulnerability is.\n\n28:00.180 --> 28:03.860\n Or you can make a Bitcoin payment of 50 Bitcoin\n\n28:03.860 --> 28:06.980\n to get a master decryption key for all your customers.\n\n28:06.980 --> 28:10.260\n 50 Bitcoin is about $1.8 million.\n\n28:10.260 --> 28:11.900\n OK.\n\n28:11.900 --> 28:18.100\n So first of all, on a personal level, this one hurt for me.\n\n28:18.100 --> 28:22.140\n There's, I mean, I learned a lot because I wasn't,\n\n28:22.140 --> 28:26.980\n for the most part, backing up much of that data\n\n28:26.980 --> 28:30.820\n because I thought I can afford to lose that data.\n\n28:30.820 --> 28:32.500\n It's not horrible.\n\n28:32.500 --> 28:35.900\n I mean, I think you've spoken about the crown jewels,\n\n28:35.900 --> 28:38.380\n like making sure there's things you really protect.\n\n28:38.380 --> 28:42.380\n And I have, you know, I'm very conscious,\n\n28:42.380 --> 28:45.060\n security wise, on the crown jewels.\n\n28:45.060 --> 28:48.060\n But there's a bunch of stuff, like, you know,\n\n28:48.060 --> 28:49.900\n personal videos that are not, like,\n\n28:49.900 --> 28:51.900\n I don't have anything creepy, but just, like,\n\n28:51.900 --> 28:55.420\n fun things I did that because they're very large or 4K\n\n28:55.420 --> 28:57.340\n or something like that, I kept them on there,\n\n28:57.340 --> 28:59.700\n thinking RAID 5 will protect it.\n\n28:59.700 --> 29:05.100\n You know, just I lost a bunch of stuff, including raw footage\n\n29:05.100 --> 29:08.300\n from interviews and all that kind of stuff.\n\n29:08.300 --> 29:09.540\n So it's painful.\n\n29:09.540 --> 29:11.660\n And I'm sure there's a lot of painful stuff\n\n29:11.660 --> 29:15.540\n like that for the 4,000 to 5,000 people that use QNAP.\n\n29:15.540 --> 29:18.420\n And there's a lot of interesting ethical questions here.\n\n29:18.420 --> 29:20.620\n Do you pay them?\n\n29:20.620 --> 29:23.220\n Does QNAP pay them?\n\n29:23.220 --> 29:26.260\n Do the individuals pay them, especially when\n\n29:26.260 --> 29:29.020\n you don't know if it's going to work or not?\n\n29:29.020 --> 29:30.220\n Do you wait?\n\n29:30.220 --> 29:35.860\n So QNAP said that, please don't pay them.\n\n29:35.860 --> 29:38.860\n We're working very hard day and night to solve this.\n\n29:41.980 --> 29:44.060\n It's so philosophically interesting to me\n\n29:44.060 --> 29:46.500\n because I also project onto them thinking,\n\n29:46.500 --> 29:48.220\n what is their motivation?\n\n29:48.220 --> 29:51.900\n Because the way they phrased it, on purpose, perhaps,\n\n29:51.900 --> 29:54.820\n but I'm not sure if that actually reflects their real motivation,\n\n29:54.820 --> 29:59.220\n is maybe they're trying to help themselves sleep at night,\n\n29:59.220 --> 30:01.260\n basically saying, this is not about you.\n\n30:01.260 --> 30:04.300\n This is about the company with the vulnerabilities.\n\n30:04.300 --> 30:07.260\n Just like you mentioned, this is the justification they have.\n\n30:07.260 --> 30:09.500\n But they're hurting real people.\n\n30:09.500 --> 30:10.460\n They hurt me.\n\n30:10.460 --> 30:14.460\n But I'm sure there's a few others that are really hurt.\n\n30:14.460 --> 30:18.540\n And the zero day factor is a big one.\n\n30:18.540 --> 30:22.260\n Their QNAP right now is trying to figure out\n\n30:22.260 --> 30:25.500\n what the hell is wrong with their system that would let this in.\n\n30:25.500 --> 30:30.140\n And even if they pay, if they still don't know where the zero\n\n30:30.140 --> 30:32.700\n day is, what's to say that they won't just hit them again\n\n30:32.700 --> 30:34.220\n and hit you again?\n\n30:34.220 --> 30:36.500\n So that really complicates things.\n\n30:36.500 --> 30:40.860\n And that is a huge advancement for ransomware.\n\n30:40.860 --> 30:44.700\n It's really only been, I think, in the last 18 months\n\n30:44.700 --> 30:48.380\n that we've ever really seen ransomware exploit zero days\n\n30:48.380 --> 30:49.220\n to pull these off.\n\n30:49.220 --> 30:54.700\n Usually, 80% of them, I think the data shows 80% of them\n\n30:54.700 --> 30:58.420\n come down to a lack of two factor authentication.\n\n30:58.420 --> 31:01.380\n So when someone gets hit by a ransomware attack,\n\n31:01.380 --> 31:04.340\n they don't have two factor authentication on.\n\n31:04.340 --> 31:07.580\n Their employees were using stupid passwords.\n\n31:07.580 --> 31:09.660\n You can mitigate that in the future.\n\n31:09.660 --> 31:10.820\n This one, they don't know.\n\n31:10.820 --> 31:11.780\n They probably don't know.\n\n31:11.780 --> 31:12.260\n Yeah.\n\n31:12.260 --> 31:14.500\n And I guess it's zero click because I\n\n31:14.500 --> 31:16.180\n didn't have to do anything.\n\n31:16.180 --> 31:21.780\n The only thing, well, here's the thing.\n\n31:21.780 --> 31:26.180\n I did basics of I put it behind a firewall.\n\n31:26.180 --> 31:27.900\n I followed instructions.\n\n31:27.900 --> 31:30.300\n But I didn't really pay attention.\n\n31:30.300 --> 31:34.180\n So maybe there's a misconfiguration of some sort\n\n31:34.180 --> 31:36.220\n that's easy to make.\n\n31:36.220 --> 31:40.100\n It's difficult. We have a personal NAS.\n\n31:40.100 --> 31:43.900\n So I'm not willing to say that I did\n\n31:43.900 --> 31:47.100\n everything I possibly could.\n\n31:47.100 --> 31:49.780\n But I did a lot of reasonable stuff.\n\n31:49.780 --> 31:51.500\n And they still hit it with zero clicks.\n\n31:51.500 --> 31:52.500\n I didn't have to do anything.\n\n31:52.500 --> 31:54.100\n Yeah, well, it's like a zero day.\n\n31:54.100 --> 31:56.980\n And it's a supply chain attack.\n\n31:56.980 --> 31:59.220\n You're getting hit from your supplier.\n\n31:59.220 --> 32:01.700\n You're getting hit because of your vendor.\n\n32:01.700 --> 32:04.260\n And it's also a new thing for ransomware groups\n\n32:04.260 --> 32:07.620\n to go to the individuals to pressure them to pay.\n\n32:07.620 --> 32:09.860\n There was this really interesting case.\n\n32:09.860 --> 32:13.660\n I think it was in Norway where there was a mental health\n\n32:13.660 --> 32:16.140\n clinic that got hit.\n\n32:16.140 --> 32:18.900\n And the cybercriminals were going to the patients\n\n32:18.900 --> 32:22.020\n themselves to say, pay this, or we're\n\n32:22.020 --> 32:25.420\n going to release your psychiatric records.\n\n32:25.420 --> 32:28.180\n I mean, talk about hell.\n\n32:28.180 --> 32:31.980\n In terms of whether to pay, that is on the cheaper\n\n32:31.980 --> 32:33.660\n end of the spectrum.\n\n32:33.660 --> 32:35.540\n From the individual or from the company?\n\n32:35.540 --> 32:36.660\n Both.\n\n32:36.660 --> 32:42.980\n We've seen, for instance, there was an Apple supplier in Taiwan.\n\n32:42.980 --> 32:43.940\n They got hit.\n\n32:43.940 --> 32:47.300\n And the ransom demand was $50 million.\n\n32:47.300 --> 32:49.420\n I'm surprised it's only $1.8 million.\n\n32:49.420 --> 32:52.100\n I'm sure it's going to go up.\n\n32:52.100 --> 32:53.300\n And it's hard.\n\n32:53.300 --> 32:57.060\n There's obviously governments, and maybe in this case,\n\n32:57.060 --> 32:58.860\n the company are going to tell you,\n\n32:58.860 --> 33:02.060\n we recommend you don't pay or please don't pay.\n\n33:02.060 --> 33:06.300\n But the reality on the ground is that some businesses\n\n33:06.300 --> 33:07.940\n can't operate.\n\n33:07.940 --> 33:09.620\n Some countries can't function.\n\n33:09.620 --> 33:15.860\n I mean, the underreported storyline of Colonial Pipeline\n\n33:15.860 --> 33:19.740\n was after the company got hit and took\n\n33:19.740 --> 33:22.140\n the preemptive step of shutting down the pipeline\n\n33:22.140 --> 33:24.180\n because their billing systems were frozen,\n\n33:24.180 --> 33:27.500\n they couldn't charge customers downstream.\n\n33:27.500 --> 33:30.140\n My colleague David Zanger and I got our hands\n\n33:30.140 --> 33:35.740\n on a classified assessment that said that as a country,\n\n33:35.740 --> 33:38.500\n we could have only afforded two to three more days\n\n33:38.500 --> 33:40.620\n of Colonial Pipeline being down.\n\n33:40.620 --> 33:42.020\n And it was really interesting.\n\n33:42.020 --> 33:45.660\n I thought it was the gas and the jet fuel, but it wasn't.\n\n33:45.660 --> 33:47.420\n We were sort of prepared for that.\n\n33:47.420 --> 33:48.980\n It was the diesel.\n\n33:48.980 --> 33:52.220\n Without the diesel, the refineries couldn't function,\n\n33:52.220 --> 33:54.900\n and it would have totally screwed up the economy.\n\n33:54.900 --> 33:59.500\n And so there was almost this national security\n\n33:59.500 --> 34:04.500\n economic impetus for them to pay this ransom.\n\n34:04.500 --> 34:07.180\n And the other one I always think about is Baltimore.\n\n34:07.180 --> 34:09.060\n When the city of Baltimore got hit,\n\n34:09.060 --> 34:11.420\n I think the initial ransom demand\n\n34:11.420 --> 34:13.860\n was something around $76,000.\n\n34:13.860 --> 34:16.820\n It may have even started smaller than that.\n\n34:16.820 --> 34:20.020\n And Baltimore stood its ground and didn't pay.\n\n34:20.020 --> 34:25.140\n But ultimately, the cost to remediate was $18 million.\n\n34:25.140 --> 34:26.780\n That's a lot for the city of Baltimore.\n\n34:26.780 --> 34:29.620\n That's money that could have gone to public school education\n\n34:29.620 --> 34:32.500\n and roads and public health.\n\n34:32.500 --> 34:35.740\n And instead, it just went to rebuilding these systems\n\n34:35.740 --> 34:36.340\n from scratch.\n\n34:36.340 --> 34:38.820\n And so a lot of residents in Baltimore\n\n34:38.820 --> 34:43.540\n were like, why the hell didn't you pay the $76,000?\n\n34:43.540 --> 34:46.020\n So it's not obvious.\n\n34:46.020 --> 34:48.140\n It's easy to say, don't pay.\n\n34:48.140 --> 34:48.740\n Because why?\n\n34:48.740 --> 34:52.940\n You're funding their R&D for the next go round.\n\n34:52.940 --> 34:56.980\n But it's too often, it's too complicated.\n\n34:56.980 --> 35:00.460\n So on the individual level, just like the way\n\n35:00.460 --> 35:03.300\n I feel personally from this attack,\n\n35:03.300 --> 35:05.300\n have you talked to people that were kind of victims\n\n35:05.300 --> 35:09.700\n in the same way I was, but maybe more dramatic ways or so on,\n\n35:09.700 --> 35:13.340\n in the same way that violence hurts people?\n\n35:13.340 --> 35:15.260\n How much does this hurt people in your sense\n\n35:15.260 --> 35:16.700\n and the way you researched it?\n\n35:16.700 --> 35:23.060\n The worst ransomware attack I've covered on a personal level\n\n35:23.060 --> 35:28.020\n was an attack on a hospital in Vermont.\n\n35:28.020 --> 35:30.420\n And you think of this as like, OK,\n\n35:30.420 --> 35:31.780\n it's hitting their IT networks.\n\n35:31.780 --> 35:34.660\n They should still be able to treat patients.\n\n35:34.660 --> 35:37.380\n But it turns out that cancer patients\n\n35:37.380 --> 35:39.260\n couldn't get their chemo anymore.\n\n35:39.260 --> 35:43.020\n Because the protocol of who gets what is very complicated.\n\n35:43.020 --> 35:47.100\n And without it, nurses and doctors couldn't access it.\n\n35:47.100 --> 35:50.500\n So they were turning chemo patients away,\n\n35:50.500 --> 35:52.180\n cancer patients away.\n\n35:52.180 --> 35:55.660\n One nurse told us, I don't know why people\n\n35:55.660 --> 35:58.380\n aren't screaming about this, that the only thing I've\n\n35:58.380 --> 36:00.100\n seen that even compares to what we're\n\n36:00.100 --> 36:02.060\n seeing at this hospital right now\n\n36:02.060 --> 36:04.460\n was when I worked in the burn unit\n\n36:04.460 --> 36:06.980\n after the Boston Marathon bombing.\n\n36:06.980 --> 36:10.540\n They really put it in these super dramatic terms.\n\n36:10.540 --> 36:15.020\n And last year there was a report in the Wall Street Journal\n\n36:15.020 --> 36:20.700\n where they attributed an infant death to a ransomware attack\n\n36:20.700 --> 36:25.220\n because a mom came in and whatever device\n\n36:25.220 --> 36:28.460\n they were using to monitor the fetus\n\n36:28.460 --> 36:30.780\n wasn't working because of the ransomware attack.\n\n36:30.780 --> 36:33.580\n And so they attributed this infant death\n\n36:33.580 --> 36:34.660\n to the ransomware attack.\n\n36:34.660 --> 36:39.100\n Now on a bigger scale but less personal,\n\n36:39.100 --> 36:41.300\n when there was the NotPetya attack.\n\n36:41.300 --> 36:46.980\n So this was an attack by Russia on Ukraine\n\n36:46.980 --> 36:51.420\n that came at them through a supplier, a tax software\n\n36:51.420 --> 36:53.860\n company in that case, that didn't just\n\n36:53.860 --> 36:57.820\n hit any government agency or business in Ukraine\n\n36:57.820 --> 36:59.660\n that used this tax software.\n\n36:59.660 --> 37:02.780\n It actually hit any business all over the world that\n\n37:02.780 --> 37:07.340\n had even a single employee working remotely in Ukraine.\n\n37:07.340 --> 37:10.980\n So it hit Maersk, the shipping company, hit Pfizer,\n\n37:10.980 --> 37:14.580\n hit FedEx, but the one I will never forget is Merck.\n\n37:14.580 --> 37:17.740\n It paralyzed Merck's factories.\n\n37:17.740 --> 37:20.260\n I mean, it really created an existential crisis\n\n37:20.260 --> 37:21.620\n for the company.\n\n37:21.620 --> 37:25.380\n Merck had to tap into the CDC's emergency supplies\n\n37:25.380 --> 37:27.780\n of the Gardasil vaccine that year\n\n37:27.780 --> 37:30.220\n because their whole vaccine production line had been\n\n37:30.220 --> 37:32.140\n paralyzed in that attack.\n\n37:32.140 --> 37:36.020\n Imagine if that was going to happen right now\n\n37:36.020 --> 37:39.820\n to Pfizer or Moderna or Johnson and Johnson.\n\n37:39.820 --> 37:41.220\n Imagine.\n\n37:41.220 --> 37:46.100\n I mean, that would really create a global cyber terrorist\n\n37:46.100 --> 37:47.260\n attack, essentially.\n\n37:47.260 --> 37:49.340\n And that's almost unintentional.\n\n37:49.340 --> 37:51.740\n I thought for a long time, I always\n\n37:51.740 --> 37:54.860\n labeled it as collateral damage.\n\n37:54.860 --> 37:59.780\n But actually, just today, there was a really impressive threat\n\n37:59.780 --> 38:04.260\n researcher at Cisco, which has this threat intelligence\n\n38:04.260 --> 38:07.220\n division called Talos, who said, stop calling it\n\n38:07.220 --> 38:08.940\n collateral damage.\n\n38:08.940 --> 38:12.900\n They could see who was going to get hit before they\n\n38:12.900 --> 38:15.580\n deployed that malware.\n\n38:15.580 --> 38:17.940\n It wasn't collateral damage.\n\n38:17.940 --> 38:19.060\n It was intentional.\n\n38:19.060 --> 38:23.180\n They meant to hit any business that did business with Ukraine.\n\n38:23.180 --> 38:26.300\n It was to send a message to them, too.\n\n38:26.300 --> 38:28.660\n So I don't know if that's accurate.\n\n38:28.660 --> 38:31.500\n I always thought of it as sort of the sloppy collateral\n\n38:31.500 --> 38:34.820\n damage, but it definitely made me think.\n\n38:34.820 --> 38:37.020\n So how much of this between states\n\n38:37.020 --> 38:42.980\n is going to be a part of war, these kinds of attacks\n\n38:42.980 --> 38:48.700\n on Ukraine between Russia and US, Russia and China,\n\n38:48.700 --> 38:51.100\n China and US?\n\n38:51.100 --> 38:53.260\n Let's look at China and US.\n\n38:53.260 --> 38:56.860\n Do you think China and US are going\n\n38:56.860 --> 39:01.740\n to escalate something that would be called a war purely\n\n39:01.740 --> 39:04.260\n in the space of cyber?\n\n39:04.260 --> 39:12.260\n I believe any geopolitical conflict from now on\n\n39:12.260 --> 39:17.260\n is guaranteed to have some cyber element to it.\n\n39:17.260 --> 39:19.180\n The Department of Justice recently\n\n39:19.180 --> 39:21.740\n declassified a report that said China has been hacking\n\n39:21.740 --> 39:24.340\n into our pipelines, and it's not for intellectual property\n\n39:24.340 --> 39:25.300\n theft.\n\n39:25.300 --> 39:29.180\n It's to get a foothold so that if things escalate in Taiwan,\n\n39:29.180 --> 39:31.460\n for example, they are where they need\n\n39:31.460 --> 39:33.260\n to be to shut our pipelines down.\n\n39:33.260 --> 39:35.260\n And we just got a little glimpse of what\n\n39:35.260 --> 39:39.340\n that looked like with Colonial Pipeline and the panic buying\n\n39:39.340 --> 39:42.460\n and the jet fuel shortages and that assessment I just\n\n39:42.460 --> 39:44.580\n mentioned about the diesel.\n\n39:44.580 --> 39:47.180\n So they're there.\n\n39:47.180 --> 39:49.260\n They've gotten there.\n\n39:49.260 --> 39:54.260\n Anytime I read a report about new aggression from fighter\n\n39:54.260 --> 39:57.020\n jets, Chinese fighter jets in Taiwan,\n\n39:57.020 --> 40:00.580\n or what's happening right now with Russia's buildup\n\n40:00.580 --> 40:04.540\n on the Ukraine border, or India, Pakistan,\n\n40:04.540 --> 40:07.420\n I'm always looking at it through a cyber lens.\n\n40:07.420 --> 40:11.420\n And it really bothers me that other people aren't,\n\n40:11.420 --> 40:15.500\n because there is no way that these governments\n\n40:15.500 --> 40:17.780\n and these nation states are not going\n\n40:17.780 --> 40:23.660\n to use their access to gain some advantage in those conflicts.\n\n40:23.660 --> 40:27.780\n And I'm now in a position where I'm\n\n40:27.780 --> 40:32.180\n an advisor to the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security\n\n40:32.180 --> 40:33.740\n Agency at DHS.\n\n40:33.740 --> 40:37.500\n So I'm not saying anything classified here.\n\n40:37.500 --> 40:41.140\n But I just think that it's really important\n\n40:41.140 --> 40:45.980\n to understand just generally what the collateral damage\n\n40:45.980 --> 40:49.900\n could be for American businesses and critical infrastructure\n\n40:49.900 --> 40:54.020\n in any of these escalated conflicts around the world.\n\n40:54.020 --> 40:57.860\n Because just generally, our adversaries\n\n40:57.860 --> 41:01.300\n have learned that they might never\n\n41:01.300 --> 41:04.620\n be able to match us in terms of our traditional military\n\n41:04.620 --> 41:08.020\n spending on traditional weapons and fighter jets.\n\n41:08.020 --> 41:10.820\n But we have a very soft underbelly\n\n41:10.820 --> 41:12.860\n when it comes to cyber.\n\n41:12.860 --> 41:17.380\n 80% or more of America's critical infrastructure,\n\n41:17.380 --> 41:23.460\n so pipelines, power grid, nuclear plants, water systems,\n\n41:23.460 --> 41:26.740\n is owned and operated by the private sector.\n\n41:26.740 --> 41:31.540\n And for the most part, there is nothing out there legislating\n\n41:31.540 --> 41:35.660\n that those companies share the fact they've been breached.\n\n41:35.660 --> 41:38.660\n They don't even have to tell the government they've been hit.\n\n41:38.660 --> 41:40.460\n There's nothing mandating that they even\n\n41:40.460 --> 41:44.740\n meet a bare minimum standard of cybersecurity.\n\n41:44.740 --> 41:46.620\n And that's it.\n\n41:46.620 --> 41:49.380\n So even when there are these attacks, most of the time,\n\n41:49.380 --> 41:51.380\n we don't even know about it.\n\n41:51.380 --> 41:54.260\n So that is, if you were going to design a system\n\n41:54.260 --> 41:57.940\n to be as blind and vulnerable as possible,\n\n41:57.940 --> 42:00.580\n that's pretty good.\n\n42:00.580 --> 42:02.620\n That's what it looks like is what we have here\n\n42:02.620 --> 42:04.340\n in the United States.\n\n42:04.340 --> 42:08.340\n And everyone here is just operating like,\n\n42:08.340 --> 42:12.140\n let's just keep hooking up everything for convenience.\n\n42:12.140 --> 42:14.740\n Software eats the world.\n\n42:14.740 --> 42:18.580\n Let's just keep going for cost, for convenience sake,\n\n42:18.580 --> 42:20.660\n just because we can.\n\n42:20.660 --> 42:24.340\n And when you study these issues and you study these attacks\n\n42:24.340 --> 42:29.340\n and you study the advancement and the uptick in frequency\n\n42:29.340 --> 42:34.660\n and the lower barrier to entry that we see every single year,\n\n42:34.660 --> 42:39.740\n you realize just how dumb software eats world is.\n\n42:39.740 --> 42:43.100\n And no one has ever stopped to pause and think,\n\n42:43.100 --> 42:47.940\n should we be hooking up these systems to the internet?\n\n42:47.940 --> 42:49.700\n They've just been saying, can we?\n\n42:49.700 --> 42:51.140\n Let's do it.\n\n42:51.140 --> 42:52.460\n And that's a real problem.\n\n42:52.460 --> 42:55.740\n And just in the last year, we've seen a record number\n\n42:55.740 --> 42:56.860\n of zero day attacks.\n\n42:56.860 --> 42:59.220\n I think there were 80 last year, which\n\n42:59.220 --> 43:03.140\n is probably more than double what it was in 2019.\n\n43:03.140 --> 43:06.940\n A lot of those were nation states.\n\n43:06.940 --> 43:10.300\n We live in a world with a lot of geopolitical hot points\n\n43:10.300 --> 43:11.500\n right now.\n\n43:11.500 --> 43:15.060\n And where those geopolitical hot points are\n\n43:15.060 --> 43:19.060\n are places where countries have been investing heavily\n\n43:19.060 --> 43:21.660\n in offensive cyber tools.\n\n43:21.660 --> 43:25.300\n If you're a nation state, the goal\n\n43:25.300 --> 43:29.380\n would be to maximize the footprint of zero day,\n\n43:29.380 --> 43:33.260\n like super secret zero day that nobody is aware of.\n\n43:33.260 --> 43:37.420\n And whenever war is initiated, the huge negative effects\n\n43:37.420 --> 43:39.900\n of shutting down infrastructure or any kind of zero day\n\n43:39.900 --> 43:41.780\n is the chaos it creates.\n\n43:41.780 --> 43:43.540\n So if you just, there's a certain threshold\n\n43:43.540 --> 43:45.260\n when you create the chaos.\n\n43:45.260 --> 43:46.460\n The market's plummeted.\n\n43:46.460 --> 43:51.020\n Just everything goes to hell.\n\n43:51.020 --> 43:52.860\n I mean, it's not just zero days.\n\n43:52.860 --> 43:56.660\n We make it so easy for threat actors.\n\n43:56.660 --> 44:00.420\n I mean, we're not using two factor authentication.\n\n44:00.420 --> 44:02.700\n We're not patching.\n\n44:02.700 --> 44:04.860\n There was the shell shock vulnerability\n\n44:04.860 --> 44:08.220\n that was discovered a couple of years ago.\n\n44:08.220 --> 44:11.220\n It's still being exploited because so many people\n\n44:11.220 --> 44:13.900\n haven't fixed it.\n\n44:13.900 --> 44:17.060\n So the zero days are really the sexy stuff.\n\n44:17.060 --> 44:19.700\n And what really drew me to the zero day market\n\n44:19.700 --> 44:24.460\n was the moral calculus we talked about, particularly\n\n44:24.460 --> 44:26.740\n from the US government's point of view.\n\n44:26.740 --> 44:31.980\n How do they justify leaving these systems so vulnerable\n\n44:31.980 --> 44:34.940\n when we use them here and we're baking\n\n44:34.940 --> 44:36.580\n more of our critical infrastructure\n\n44:36.580 --> 44:38.620\n with this vulnerable software?\n\n44:38.620 --> 44:41.580\n It's not like we're using one set of technology\n\n44:41.580 --> 44:43.740\n and Russia is using another and China is using this.\n\n44:43.740 --> 44:45.980\n We're all using the same technology.\n\n44:45.980 --> 44:49.020\n So when you find a zero day in Windows,\n\n44:49.020 --> 44:52.340\n you're not just leaving it open so you can spy on Russia\n\n44:52.340 --> 44:54.540\n or implant yourself in the Russian grid.\n\n44:54.540 --> 44:58.820\n You're leaving Americans vulnerable too.\n\n44:58.820 --> 45:02.180\n But zero days are like, that is the secret sauce.\n\n45:02.180 --> 45:04.980\n That's the superpower.\n\n45:04.980 --> 45:07.900\n And I always say every country now,\n\n45:07.900 --> 45:09.380\n with the exception of Antarctica,\n\n45:09.380 --> 45:11.900\n someone added the Vatican to my list,\n\n45:11.900 --> 45:16.700\n is trying to find offensive hacking tools and zero days\n\n45:16.700 --> 45:17.500\n to make them work.\n\n45:17.500 --> 45:20.620\n And those that don't have the skills\n\n45:20.620 --> 45:23.460\n now have this market that they can tap into,\n\n45:23.460 --> 45:26.380\n where $2.5 million, that's chump change\n\n45:26.380 --> 45:27.900\n for a lot of these nation states.\n\n45:27.900 --> 45:29.820\n It's a hell of a lot less than trying\n\n45:29.820 --> 45:32.940\n to build the next fighter jet.\n\n45:32.940 --> 45:34.460\n But yeah, the goal is chaos.\n\n45:34.460 --> 45:38.420\n I mean, why did Russia turn off the lights twice in Ukraine?\n\n45:39.620 --> 45:42.700\n I think part of it is chaos.\n\n45:42.700 --> 45:46.220\n I think part of it is to sow the seeds of doubt\n\n45:46.220 --> 45:47.920\n in their current government.\n\n45:47.920 --> 45:50.380\n Your government can't even keep your lights on.\n\n45:50.380 --> 45:52.760\n Why are you sticking with them?\n\n45:52.760 --> 45:56.340\n Come over here and we'll keep your lights on at least.\n\n45:56.340 --> 45:58.300\n There's like a little bit of that.\n\n45:58.300 --> 46:04.620\n Nuclear weapons seems to have helped prevent nuclear war.\n\n46:04.620 --> 46:08.260\n Is it possible that we have so many vulnerabilities\n\n46:08.260 --> 46:11.260\n and so many attack vectors on each other\n\n46:11.260 --> 46:15.220\n that you will kind of achieve the same kind of equilibrium\n\n46:15.220 --> 46:16.940\n like mutually shared destruction?\n\n46:17.740 --> 46:18.700\n Yeah.\n\n46:18.700 --> 46:20.700\n That's one hopeful solution to this.\n\n46:20.700 --> 46:23.760\n Do you have any hope for this particular solution?\n\n46:23.760 --> 46:26.480\n You know, nuclear analogies always tend to fall apart\n\n46:26.480 --> 46:27.500\n when it comes to cyber,\n\n46:27.500 --> 46:30.940\n mainly because you don't need fissile material.\n\n46:30.940 --> 46:33.260\n You know, you just need a laptop and the skills\n\n46:33.260 --> 46:34.580\n and you're in the game.\n\n46:34.580 --> 46:36.840\n So it's a really low barrier to entry.\n\n46:38.180 --> 46:40.900\n The other thing is attribution is harder.\n\n46:40.900 --> 46:44.260\n And we've seen countries muck around with attribution.\n\n46:44.260 --> 46:47.100\n We've seen, you know, nation states piggyback\n\n46:47.100 --> 46:50.020\n on other countries spy operations and just sit there\n\n46:50.020 --> 46:53.340\n and siphon out whatever they're getting.\n\n46:53.340 --> 46:56.120\n We learned some of that from the Snowden documents.\n\n46:56.120 --> 46:58.860\n We've seen Russia hack into Iran's command\n\n46:58.860 --> 47:01.340\n and control attack servers.\n\n47:01.340 --> 47:05.380\n We've seen them hit a Saudi petrochemical plant\n\n47:05.380 --> 47:08.140\n where they did neutralize the safety locks at the plant\n\n47:08.140 --> 47:10.120\n and everyone assumed that it was Iran,\n\n47:10.120 --> 47:13.600\n given Iran had been targeting Saudi oil companies forever.\n\n47:13.600 --> 47:15.180\n But nope, it turned out that it was\n\n47:15.180 --> 47:17.720\n a graduate research institute outside Moscow.\n\n47:17.720 --> 47:20.220\n So you see countries kind of playing around\n\n47:20.220 --> 47:21.060\n with attribution.\n\n47:21.060 --> 47:22.220\n Why?\n\n47:22.220 --> 47:25.340\n I think because they think, okay, if I do this,\n\n47:25.340 --> 47:27.760\n like how am I gonna cover up that it came from me\n\n47:27.760 --> 47:30.840\n because I don't wanna risk the response.\n\n47:30.840 --> 47:33.140\n So people are sort of dancing around this.\n\n47:33.140 --> 47:34.940\n It's just in a very different way.\n\n47:34.940 --> 47:39.580\n And, you know, at the times I'd covered the Chinese hacks\n\n47:39.580 --> 47:42.820\n of infrastructure companies like pipelines.\n\n47:42.820 --> 47:46.100\n I'd covered the Russian probes of nuclear plants.\n\n47:46.100 --> 47:50.060\n I'd covered the Russian attacks on the Ukraine grid.\n\n47:50.060 --> 47:53.820\n And then in 2018, my colleague David Sanger and I\n\n47:53.820 --> 47:57.100\n covered the fact that US Cyber Command\n\n47:57.100 --> 47:59.580\n had been hacking into the Russian grid\n\n47:59.580 --> 48:02.180\n and making a pretty loud show of it.\n\n48:02.180 --> 48:05.220\n And when we went to the National Security Council,\n\n48:05.220 --> 48:06.780\n because that's what journalists do\n\n48:06.780 --> 48:08.080\n before they publish a story,\n\n48:08.080 --> 48:11.380\n they give the other side a chance to respond,\n\n48:11.380 --> 48:14.460\n I assumed we would be in for that really awkward,\n\n48:14.460 --> 48:17.060\n painful conversation where they would say,\n\n48:17.060 --> 48:20.260\n you will have blood on your hands if you publish this story.\n\n48:20.260 --> 48:22.940\n And instead they gave us the opposite answer.\n\n48:22.940 --> 48:25.100\n They said, we have no problem\n\n48:25.100 --> 48:27.140\n with you publishing this story.\n\n48:27.140 --> 48:28.020\n Why?\n\n48:28.020 --> 48:29.340\n Well, they didn't say it out loud,\n\n48:29.340 --> 48:33.120\n but it was pretty obvious they wanted Russia to know\n\n48:33.120 --> 48:35.300\n that we're hacking into their power grid too,\n\n48:35.300 --> 48:38.420\n and they better think twice before they do to us\n\n48:38.420 --> 48:40.180\n what they had done to Ukraine.\n\n48:40.180 --> 48:44.620\n So yeah, you know, we have stumbled into this new era\n\n48:44.620 --> 48:47.740\n of mutually assured digital destruction.\n\n48:47.740 --> 48:52.740\n I think another sort of quasi norm we've stumbled into\n\n48:54.500 --> 48:57.660\n is proportional responses.\n\n48:57.660 --> 49:00.540\n There's this idea that if you get hit,\n\n49:00.540 --> 49:03.480\n you're allowed to respond proportionally\n\n49:03.480 --> 49:05.780\n at a time and place of your choosing.\n\n49:05.780 --> 49:08.420\n That is how the language always goes.\n\n49:08.420 --> 49:12.880\n That's what Obama said after North Korea hit Sony.\n\n49:12.880 --> 49:15.640\n We will respond at a time and place of our choosing.\n\n49:15.640 --> 49:20.640\n But no one really knows like what that response looks like.\n\n49:21.100 --> 49:22.740\n And so what you see a lot of the time\n\n49:22.740 --> 49:27.140\n are just these like, just short of war attacks.\n\n49:27.140 --> 49:29.300\n You know, Russia turned off the power in Ukraine,\n\n49:29.300 --> 49:31.840\n but it wasn't like it stayed off for a week.\n\n49:31.840 --> 49:34.800\n You know, it stayed off for a number of hours.\n\n49:34.800 --> 49:39.620\n You know, NotPetya hit those companies pretty hard,\n\n49:39.620 --> 49:41.340\n but no one died, you know?\n\n49:41.340 --> 49:44.520\n And the question is, what's gonna happen when someone dies?\n\n49:44.520 --> 49:49.520\n And can a nation state masquerade as a cyber criminal group,\n\n49:49.780 --> 49:51.580\n as a ransomware group?\n\n49:51.580 --> 49:53.500\n And that's what really complicates\n\n49:53.500 --> 49:57.140\n coming to some sort of digital Geneva convention.\n\n49:57.140 --> 50:01.140\n Like there's been a push from Brad Smith at Microsoft.\n\n50:01.140 --> 50:03.660\n We need a digital Geneva convention.\n\n50:03.660 --> 50:06.060\n And on its face, it sounds like a no brainer.\n\n50:06.060 --> 50:08.880\n Yeah, why wouldn't we all agree to stop hacking\n\n50:08.880 --> 50:11.140\n into each other's civilian hospital systems,\n\n50:11.140 --> 50:15.580\n elections, power grid, pipelines?\n\n50:15.580 --> 50:19.780\n But when you talk to people in the West,\n\n50:19.780 --> 50:22.460\n officials in the West, they'll say, we would never,\n\n50:22.460 --> 50:25.540\n we'd love to agree to it, but we'd never do it\n\n50:25.540 --> 50:30.540\n when you're dealing with Xi or Putin or Kim Jong Un.\n\n50:30.580 --> 50:35.280\n Because a lot of times, they outsource these operations\n\n50:35.280 --> 50:37.100\n to cyber criminals.\n\n50:37.100 --> 50:39.120\n In China, we see a lot of these attacks\n\n50:39.120 --> 50:43.100\n come from this loose satellite network of private citizens\n\n50:43.100 --> 50:46.720\n that work at the behest of the Ministry of State Security.\n\n50:46.720 --> 50:51.380\n So how do you come to some sort of state to state agreement\n\n50:51.380 --> 50:55.740\n when you're dealing with transnational actors\n\n50:55.740 --> 50:59.180\n and cyber criminals, where it's really hard to pin down\n\n50:59.180 --> 51:01.700\n whether that person was acting alone\n\n51:01.700 --> 51:05.020\n or whether they were acting at the behest of the MSS\n\n51:05.020 --> 51:06.600\n or the FSB.\n\n51:06.600 --> 51:09.480\n And a couple of years ago, I remember,\n\n51:09.480 --> 51:11.780\n can't remember if it was before or after NotPetya,\n\n51:11.780 --> 51:14.780\n but Putin said, hackers are like artists\n\n51:14.780 --> 51:18.140\n who wake up in the morning in a good mood and start painting.\n\n51:18.140 --> 51:21.420\n In other words, I have no say over what they do or don't do.\n\n51:21.420 --> 51:24.340\n So how do you come to some kind of norm\n\n51:24.340 --> 51:26.940\n when that's how he's talking about these issues\n\n51:26.940 --> 51:30.180\n and he's just decimated Merck and Pfizer\n\n51:30.180 --> 51:34.220\n and another however many thousand companies?\n\n51:34.220 --> 51:37.620\n That is the fundamental difference between nuclear weapons\n\n51:37.620 --> 51:40.420\n and cyber attacks is the attribution\n\n51:40.420 --> 51:42.580\n or one of the fundamental differences.\n\n51:42.580 --> 51:45.220\n If you can fix one thing in the world\n\n51:45.220 --> 51:47.220\n in terms of cybersecurity\n\n51:47.220 --> 51:48.980\n that would make the world a better place,\n\n51:48.980 --> 51:51.160\n what would you fix?\n\n51:51.160 --> 51:54.140\n So you're not allowed to fix like authoritarian regimes\n\n51:54.140 --> 51:55.460\n and you can't.\n\n51:55.460 --> 51:57.980\n You have to keep that,\n\n51:57.980 --> 52:00.620\n you have to keep human nature as it is.\n\n52:00.620 --> 52:05.100\n In terms of on the security side, technologically speaking,\n\n52:05.100 --> 52:06.540\n you mentioned there's no regulation\n\n52:06.540 --> 52:09.020\n on companies in United States.\n\n52:10.020 --> 52:14.860\n What if you could just fix with the snap of a finger,\n\n52:14.860 --> 52:15.740\n what would you fix?\n\n52:15.740 --> 52:19.840\n Two factor authentication, multifactor authentication.\n\n52:19.840 --> 52:24.780\n It's ridiculous how many of these attacks come in\n\n52:24.780 --> 52:27.640\n because someone didn't turn on multifactor authentication.\n\n52:27.640 --> 52:30.740\n I mean, Colonial Pipeline, okay?\n\n52:30.740 --> 52:34.300\n They took down the biggest conduit\n\n52:34.300 --> 52:35.860\n for gas, jet fuel and diesel\n\n52:35.860 --> 52:39.180\n to the East Coast of the United States of America, how?\n\n52:39.180 --> 52:42.180\n Because they forgot to deactivate an old employee account\n\n52:42.180 --> 52:44.700\n whose password had been traded on the dark web\n\n52:44.700 --> 52:48.020\n and they'd never turned on two factor authentication.\n\n52:48.020 --> 52:50.140\n This water treatment facility outside Florida\n\n52:50.140 --> 52:51.700\n was hacked last year.\n\n52:51.700 --> 52:53.220\n How did it happen?\n\n52:53.220 --> 52:56.500\n They were using Windows XP from like a decade ago\n\n52:56.500 --> 52:59.300\n that can't even get patches if you want it to\n\n52:59.300 --> 53:01.700\n and they didn't have two factor authentication.\n\n53:01.700 --> 53:02.700\n Time and time again,\n\n53:02.700 --> 53:06.740\n if they just switched on two factor authentication,\n\n53:06.740 --> 53:08.340\n some of these attacks wouldn't have been possible.\n\n53:08.340 --> 53:10.080\n Now, if I could snap my fingers,\n\n53:10.080 --> 53:11.780\n that's the thing I would do right now.\n\n53:11.780 --> 53:15.100\n But of course, this is a cat and mouse game\n\n53:15.100 --> 53:17.560\n and then the attackers onto the next thing.\n\n53:17.560 --> 53:21.700\n But I think right now that is like bar none.\n\n53:21.700 --> 53:24.660\n That is just, that is the easiest, simplest way\n\n53:24.660 --> 53:25.900\n to deflect the most attacks.\n\n53:25.900 --> 53:29.780\n And the name of the game right now isn't perfect security.\n\n53:29.780 --> 53:32.220\n Perfect security is impossible.\n\n53:32.220 --> 53:34.340\n They will always find a way in.\n\n53:34.340 --> 53:35.460\n The name of the game right now\n\n53:35.460 --> 53:39.060\n is make yourself a little bit harder to attack\n\n53:39.060 --> 53:41.480\n than your competitor than anyone else out there\n\n53:41.480 --> 53:44.320\n so that they just give up and move along.\n\n53:44.320 --> 53:46.540\n And maybe if you are a target\n\n53:46.540 --> 53:50.500\n for an advanced nation state or the SVR,\n\n53:51.500 --> 53:53.860\n you're gonna get hacked no matter what.\n\n53:53.860 --> 53:57.740\n But you can make cyber criminal groups deadbolt, is it?\n\n53:57.740 --> 53:59.820\n You can make their jobs a lot harder\n\n54:00.780 --> 54:03.180\n simply by doing the bare basics.\n\n54:03.180 --> 54:05.260\n And the other thing is stop reusing your passwords.\n\n54:05.260 --> 54:08.060\n But if I only get one, then two factor authentication.\n\n54:08.060 --> 54:10.460\n So what is two factor authentication?\n\n54:10.460 --> 54:13.260\n Factor one is what, logging in with a password.\n\n54:13.260 --> 54:15.900\n And factor two is like have another device\n\n54:15.900 --> 54:18.420\n or another channel through which you can confirm,\n\n54:18.420 --> 54:19.500\n yeah, that's me.\n\n54:19.500 --> 54:23.700\n Yes, usually this happens through some kind of text.\n\n54:23.700 --> 54:26.740\n You get your one time code from Bank of America\n\n54:26.740 --> 54:28.700\n or from Google.\n\n54:28.700 --> 54:31.460\n The better way to do it is spend $20\n\n54:31.460 --> 54:34.260\n buying yourself a Fido key on Amazon.\n\n54:34.260 --> 54:36.100\n That's a hardware device.\n\n54:36.100 --> 54:39.500\n And if you don't have that hardware device with you,\n\n54:39.500 --> 54:41.300\n then you're not gonna get in.\n\n54:41.300 --> 54:43.820\n And the whole goal is, I mean, basically,\n\n54:43.820 --> 54:46.060\n my first half of my decade at The Times\n\n54:46.060 --> 54:49.100\n was spent covering like the copy.\n\n54:49.100 --> 54:51.380\n It was like Home Depot got breached,\n\n54:51.380 --> 54:54.420\n News at 11, Target, Neumann Marcus,\n\n54:54.420 --> 54:58.420\n like who wasn't hacked over the course of those five years?\n\n54:58.420 --> 55:01.100\n And a lot of those companies that got hacked,\n\n55:01.100 --> 55:02.220\n what did hackers take?\n\n55:02.220 --> 55:05.500\n They took the credentials, they took the passwords.\n\n55:05.500 --> 55:08.820\n They can make a pretty penny selling them on the dark web\n\n55:08.820 --> 55:11.540\n and people reuse their passwords.\n\n55:11.540 --> 55:15.580\n So you get one from God knows who, I don't know,\n\n55:15.580 --> 55:19.340\n LastPass, worst case example, actually LastPass.\n\n55:19.340 --> 55:21.860\n But you get one and then you go test it\n\n55:21.860 --> 55:23.420\n on their email account.\n\n55:23.420 --> 55:25.580\n And you go test it on their brokerage account\n\n55:25.580 --> 55:28.620\n and you test it on their cold storage account.\n\n55:28.620 --> 55:29.580\n That's how it works.\n\n55:29.580 --> 55:32.900\n But if you have multi factor authentication,\n\n55:32.900 --> 55:34.500\n then they can't get in\n\n55:34.500 --> 55:36.740\n because they might have your password,\n\n55:36.740 --> 55:38.060\n but they don't have your phone,\n\n55:38.060 --> 55:39.740\n they don't have your Fido key.\n\n55:41.180 --> 55:42.700\n So you keep them out.\n\n55:42.700 --> 55:46.540\n And I get a lot of alerts that tell me\n\n55:46.540 --> 55:49.820\n someone is trying to get into your Instagram account\n\n55:49.820 --> 55:52.060\n or your Twitter account or your email account.\n\n55:52.060 --> 55:55.820\n And I don't worry because I use multi factor authentication.\n\n55:55.820 --> 55:57.180\n They can try all day.\n\n55:58.380 --> 56:03.380\n Okay, I worry a little bit, but it's the simplest thing to do\n\n56:03.820 --> 56:05.060\n and we don't even do it.\n\n56:05.060 --> 56:06.860\n Well, there's an interface aspect to it\n\n56:06.860 --> 56:09.820\n because it's pretty annoying if it's implemented poorly.\n\n56:11.420 --> 56:13.060\n So actually bad implementation\n\n56:13.060 --> 56:16.420\n of two factor authentication, not just bad,\n\n56:16.420 --> 56:19.060\n but just something that adds friction\n\n56:19.060 --> 56:21.380\n is a security vulnerability, I guess,\n\n56:21.380 --> 56:23.500\n because it's really annoying.\n\n56:23.500 --> 56:27.620\n Like I think MIT for a while had two factor authentication.\n\n56:27.620 --> 56:28.580\n It was really annoying.\n\n56:28.580 --> 56:33.020\n I just, like the number of times it pings you,\n\n56:33.020 --> 56:38.020\n like it asks to reauthenticate across multiple subdomains.\n\n56:39.300 --> 56:41.780\n Like it just feels like a pain.\n\n56:42.780 --> 56:44.140\n I don't know what the right balance there.\n\n56:44.140 --> 56:48.700\n Yeah, it feels like friction in our frictionless society.\n\n56:48.700 --> 56:51.060\n It feels like friction, it's annoying.\n\n56:51.060 --> 56:54.540\n That's security's biggest problem, it's annoying.\n\n56:54.540 --> 56:57.900\n We need the Steve Jobs of security to come along\n\n56:57.900 --> 56:59.620\n and we need to make it painless.\n\n56:59.620 --> 57:02.100\n And actually on that point,\n\n57:02.100 --> 57:07.100\n Apple has probably done more for security than anyone else\n\n57:07.340 --> 57:10.900\n simply by introducing biometric authentication,\n\n57:10.900 --> 57:13.660\n first with the fingerprint and then with face ID.\n\n57:13.660 --> 57:17.460\n And it's not perfect, but if you think just eight years ago,\n\n57:17.460 --> 57:20.420\n everyone was running around with either no passcode\n\n57:20.420 --> 57:23.580\n and optional passcode or four digit passcode on their phone\n\n57:23.580 --> 57:26.140\n that anyone, think of what you can get\n\n57:26.140 --> 57:29.100\n when you get someone's iPhone, if you steal someone's iPhone\n\n57:29.100 --> 57:32.620\n and props to them for introducing the fingerprint\n\n57:32.620 --> 57:33.660\n and face ID.\n\n57:33.660 --> 57:36.980\n And again, it wasn't perfect, but it was a huge step forward.\n\n57:36.980 --> 57:40.220\n Now it's time to make another huge step forward.\n\n57:41.140 --> 57:42.900\n I wanna see the password die.\n\n57:42.900 --> 57:46.900\n I mean, it's gotten us as far as it was ever gonna get us.\n\n57:46.900 --> 57:49.580\n And I hope whatever we come up with next\n\n57:49.580 --> 57:52.380\n is not gonna be annoying, is gonna be seamless.\n\n57:52.380 --> 57:55.060\n When I was at Google, that's what we worked on is,\n\n57:55.060 --> 57:57.060\n and there's a lot of ways to call it\n\n57:57.060 --> 57:59.900\n active authentication, passive authentication.\n\n57:59.900 --> 58:02.500\n So basically you use biometric data,\n\n58:02.500 --> 58:05.980\n not just like a fingerprint, but everything from your body\n\n58:05.980 --> 58:09.140\n to identify who you are, like movement patterns.\n\n58:09.140 --> 58:12.700\n So it basically create a lot of layers of protection\n\n58:12.700 --> 58:15.460\n where it's very difficult to fake,\n\n58:15.460 --> 58:20.460\n including like face unlock, checking that it's your actual\n\n58:20.580 --> 58:23.020\n face, like the liveness tests.\n\n58:23.020 --> 58:26.220\n So like from video, so unlocking it with video,\n\n58:26.220 --> 58:30.020\n voice, the way you move the phone,\n\n58:31.020 --> 58:33.220\n the way you take it out of the pocket, that kind of thing.\n\n58:33.220 --> 58:34.980\n All of those factors.\n\n58:34.980 --> 58:37.300\n It's a really hard problem though.\n\n58:37.300 --> 58:42.020\n And ultimately, it's very difficult to beat the password\n\n58:42.020 --> 58:43.540\n in terms of security.\n\n58:43.540 --> 58:46.140\n Well, there's a company that I actually will call out\n\n58:46.140 --> 58:48.180\n and that's Abnormal Security.\n\n58:48.180 --> 58:51.420\n So they work on email attacks.\n\n58:51.420 --> 58:56.420\n And it was started by a couple of guys who were doing,\n\n58:56.620 --> 58:59.340\n I think, ad tech at Twitter.\n\n58:59.340 --> 59:02.500\n So ad technology now, like it's a joke\n\n59:02.500 --> 59:03.980\n how much they know about us.\n\n59:03.980 --> 59:06.580\n You always hear the conspiracy theories that\n\n59:06.580 --> 59:08.940\n you saw someone's shoes and next thing you know,\n\n59:08.940 --> 59:10.380\n it's on your phone.\n\n59:10.380 --> 59:12.220\n It's amazing what they know about you.\n\n59:13.660 --> 59:15.780\n And they're basically taking that\n\n59:16.660 --> 59:19.700\n and they're applying it to attacks.\n\n59:19.700 --> 59:22.740\n So they're saying, okay, if you're,\n\n59:22.740 --> 59:24.940\n this is what your email patterns are.\n\n59:24.940 --> 59:26.360\n It might be different for you and me\n\n59:26.360 --> 59:28.620\n because we're emailing strangers all the time.\n\n59:29.660 --> 59:30.980\n But for most people,\n\n59:30.980 --> 59:33.900\n their email patterns are pretty predictable.\n\n59:33.900 --> 59:38.380\n And if something strays from that pattern, that's abnormal\n\n59:38.380 --> 59:41.740\n and they'll block it, they'll investigate it.\n\n59:41.740 --> 59:43.920\n And that's great.\n\n59:43.920 --> 59:48.640\n Let's start using that kind of targeted ad technology\n\n59:48.640 --> 59:50.540\n to protect people.\n\n59:50.540 --> 59:52.980\n And yeah, I mean, it's not gonna get us away\n\n59:52.980 --> 59:56.300\n from the password and using multifactor authentication,\n\n59:56.300 --> 59:59.980\n but the technology is out there\n\n59:59.980 --> 1:00:02.100\n and we just have to figure out how to use it\n\n1:00:02.100 --> 1:00:05.680\n in a really seamless way because it doesn't matter\n\n1:00:05.680 --> 1:00:07.580\n if you have the perfect security solution\n\n1:00:07.580 --> 1:00:08.420\n if no one uses it.\n\n1:00:08.420 --> 1:00:10.380\n I mean, when I started at the times\n\n1:00:10.380 --> 1:00:12.220\n when I was trying to be really good\n\n1:00:12.220 --> 1:00:14.900\n about protecting sources,\n\n1:00:14.900 --> 1:00:17.740\n I was trying to use PGP encryption\n\n1:00:17.740 --> 1:00:19.820\n and it's like, it didn't work.\n\n1:00:19.820 --> 1:00:22.420\n The number of mistakes I would probably make\n\n1:00:22.420 --> 1:00:27.100\n just trying to email someone with PGP just wasn't worth it.\n\n1:00:27.100 --> 1:00:32.100\n And then Signal came along and Signal made it wicker.\n\n1:00:32.500 --> 1:00:34.700\n They made it a lot easier\n\n1:00:34.700 --> 1:00:37.020\n to send someone an encrypted text message.\n\n1:00:37.020 --> 1:00:42.020\n So we have to start investing in creative minds,\n\n1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:45.420\n in good security design.\n\n1:00:45.420 --> 1:00:48.020\n I really think that's the hack that's gonna get us\n\n1:00:48.020 --> 1:00:50.100\n out of where we are today.\n\n1:00:50.100 --> 1:00:52.460\n What about social engineering?\n\n1:00:52.460 --> 1:00:56.760\n Do you worry about this sort of hacking people?\n\n1:00:57.800 --> 1:01:00.940\n Yes, I mean, this is the worst nightmare\n\n1:01:00.940 --> 1:01:04.200\n of every chief information security officer out there.\n\n1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:09.020\n Social engineering, we work from home now.\n\n1:01:10.100 --> 1:01:15.100\n I saw this woman posted online about how her husband,\n\n1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:16.780\n it went viral today,\n\n1:01:16.780 --> 1:01:20.020\n but it was her husband had this problem at work.\n\n1:01:20.020 --> 1:01:22.460\n They hired a guy named John\n\n1:01:22.460 --> 1:01:26.060\n and now the guy that shows up for work every day\n\n1:01:26.060 --> 1:01:27.540\n doesn't act like John.\n\n1:01:29.620 --> 1:01:31.060\n I mean, think about that.\n\n1:01:31.060 --> 1:01:34.000\n Like think about the potential for social engineering\n\n1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.780\n in that context.\n\n1:01:35.780 --> 1:01:38.940\n You apply for a job and you put on a pretty face,\n\n1:01:38.940 --> 1:01:40.380\n you hire an actor or something,\n\n1:01:40.380 --> 1:01:42.660\n and then you just get inside the organization\n\n1:01:42.660 --> 1:01:45.700\n and get access to all that organization's data.\n\n1:01:45.700 --> 1:01:47.420\n A couple of years ago,\n\n1:01:47.420 --> 1:01:51.420\n Saudi Arabia planted spies inside Twitter.\n\n1:01:51.420 --> 1:01:52.260\n Why?\n\n1:01:52.260 --> 1:01:54.460\n Probably because they were trying to figure out\n\n1:01:54.460 --> 1:01:55.380\n who these people were\n\n1:01:55.380 --> 1:01:58.220\n who were criticizing the regime on Twitter.\n\n1:01:58.220 --> 1:02:00.020\n They couldn't do it with a hack from the outside,\n\n1:02:00.020 --> 1:02:02.260\n so why not plant people on the inside?\n\n1:02:02.260 --> 1:02:04.540\n And that's like the worst nightmare.\n\n1:02:04.540 --> 1:02:09.540\n And it also, unfortunately, creates all kinds of xenophobia\n\n1:02:09.780 --> 1:02:11.340\n at a lot of these organizations.\n\n1:02:11.340 --> 1:02:14.780\n I mean, if you're gonna have to take that into consideration,\n\n1:02:14.780 --> 1:02:16.700\n then organizations are gonna start looking\n\n1:02:16.700 --> 1:02:19.420\n really skeptically and suspiciously\n\n1:02:19.420 --> 1:02:22.180\n at someone who applies for that job from China.\n\n1:02:23.020 --> 1:02:25.760\n And we've seen that go really badly\n\n1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:28.540\n at places like the Department of Commerce,\n\n1:02:28.540 --> 1:02:31.180\n where they basically accuse people of being spies\n\n1:02:31.180 --> 1:02:32.020\n that aren't spies.\n\n1:02:32.020 --> 1:02:35.380\n So it is the hardest problem to solve,\n\n1:02:35.380 --> 1:02:37.380\n and it's never been harder to solve\n\n1:02:37.380 --> 1:02:39.180\n than right at this very moment\n\n1:02:39.180 --> 1:02:41.320\n when there's so much pressure for companies\n\n1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:43.940\n to let people work remotely.\n\n1:02:43.940 --> 1:02:45.520\n That's actually why I'm single.\n\n1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:48.420\n I'm suspicious that China and Russia,\n\n1:02:48.420 --> 1:02:49.700\n every time I meet somebody,\n\n1:02:49.700 --> 1:02:52.980\n are trying to plant and get insider information,\n\n1:02:52.980 --> 1:02:54.740\n so I'm very, very suspicious.\n\n1:02:54.740 --> 1:02:57.620\n I keep putting the touring test in front, no.\n\n1:02:57.620 --> 1:03:02.620\n No, I have a friend who worked inside NSA\n\n1:03:02.700 --> 1:03:04.840\n and was one of their top hackers,\n\n1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:08.540\n and he's like, every time I go to Russia,\n\n1:03:08.540 --> 1:03:10.820\n I get hit on by these 10s.\n\n1:03:10.820 --> 1:03:12.240\n And I come home, my friends are like,\n\n1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:13.780\n I'm sorry, you're not a 10.\n\n1:03:13.780 --> 1:03:17.020\n Like, it's a common story.\n\n1:03:17.020 --> 1:03:20.940\n I mean, it's difficult to trust humans\n\n1:03:20.940 --> 1:03:23.340\n in this day and age online.\n\n1:03:23.340 --> 1:03:27.460\n So we're working remotely, that's one thing,\n\n1:03:27.460 --> 1:03:31.620\n but just interacting with people on the internet,\n\n1:03:31.620 --> 1:03:35.300\n sounds ridiculous, but because of this podcast in part,\n\n1:03:35.300 --> 1:03:37.920\n I've gotten to meet some incredible people,\n\n1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:42.380\n but it makes you nervous to trust folks,\n\n1:03:43.300 --> 1:03:47.260\n and I don't know how to solve that problem.\n\n1:03:48.100 --> 1:03:51.460\n So I'm talking with Mark Zuckerberg,\n\n1:03:51.460 --> 1:03:53.460\n who dreams about creating the metaverse.\n\n1:03:55.540 --> 1:03:56.820\n What do you do about that world\n\n1:03:56.820 --> 1:04:01.460\n where more and more our lives is in the digital sphere?\n\n1:04:01.460 --> 1:04:05.300\n Like, one way to phrase it is,\n\n1:04:05.300 --> 1:04:10.060\n most of our meaningful experiences at some point\n\n1:04:10.060 --> 1:04:15.060\n will be online, like falling in love, getting a job,\n\n1:04:15.780 --> 1:04:19.860\n or experiencing a moment of happiness with a friend,\n\n1:04:19.860 --> 1:04:23.060\n with a new friend made online, all of those things.\n\n1:04:23.060 --> 1:04:25.500\n Like, more and more, the fun we do,\n\n1:04:25.500 --> 1:04:28.940\n the things that make us love life will happen online,\n\n1:04:28.940 --> 1:04:32.940\n and if those things have an avatar that's digital,\n\n1:04:32.940 --> 1:04:35.820\n that's like a way to hack into people's minds,\n\n1:04:35.820 --> 1:04:39.500\n whether it's with AI or kind of troll farms\n\n1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:40.940\n or something like that.\n\n1:04:40.940 --> 1:04:43.340\n I don't know if there's a way to protect against that.\n\n1:04:43.340 --> 1:04:48.340\n That might fundamentally rely on our faith\n\n1:04:49.420 --> 1:04:51.940\n in how good human nature is.\n\n1:04:51.940 --> 1:04:54.900\n So if most people are good, we're going to be okay,\n\n1:04:54.900 --> 1:04:59.220\n but if people will tend towards manipulation\n\n1:04:59.220 --> 1:05:03.300\n and malevolent behavior in search of power,\n\n1:05:03.300 --> 1:05:04.540\n then we're screwed.\n\n1:05:05.540 --> 1:05:07.860\n So I don't know if you can comment\n\n1:05:07.860 --> 1:05:10.380\n on how to keep the metaverse secure.\n\n1:05:10.380 --> 1:05:13.660\n Yeah, I mean, all I thought about\n\n1:05:13.660 --> 1:05:16.700\n when you were talking just now was my three year old son.\n\n1:05:16.700 --> 1:05:17.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:19.540 --> 1:05:22.500\n He asked me the other day, what's the internet, mom?\n\n1:05:22.500 --> 1:05:25.300\n And I just almost wanted to cry.\n\n1:05:25.300 --> 1:05:29.500\n You know, I don't want that for him.\n\n1:05:29.500 --> 1:05:32.420\n I don't want all of his most meaningful experiences\n\n1:05:32.420 --> 1:05:33.260\n to be online.\n\n1:05:33.260 --> 1:05:35.340\n You know, by the time that happens,\n\n1:05:36.900 --> 1:05:39.540\n how do you know that person's human,\n\n1:05:39.540 --> 1:05:41.540\n that avatar's human?\n\n1:05:41.540 --> 1:05:42.860\n You know, I believe in free speech.\n\n1:05:42.860 --> 1:05:46.740\n I don't believe in free speech for robots and bots.\n\n1:05:46.740 --> 1:05:51.660\n And like, look what just happened over the last six years.\n\n1:05:51.660 --> 1:05:53.860\n You know, we had bots pretending\n\n1:05:53.860 --> 1:05:56.860\n to be Black Lives Matter activists\n\n1:05:56.860 --> 1:05:59.300\n just to sow some division,\n\n1:05:59.300 --> 1:06:01.700\n or, you know, Texas secessionists,\n\n1:06:01.700 --> 1:06:06.580\n or, you know, organizing anti Hillary protests,\n\n1:06:06.580 --> 1:06:08.980\n or just to sow more division,\n\n1:06:08.980 --> 1:06:12.420\n to tie us up in our own politics\n\n1:06:12.420 --> 1:06:15.660\n so that we're so paralyzed we can't get anything done.\n\n1:06:15.660 --> 1:06:17.220\n We can't make any progress\n\n1:06:17.220 --> 1:06:19.940\n and we definitely can't handle our adversaries\n\n1:06:19.940 --> 1:06:21.580\n and their longterm thinking.\n\n1:06:22.980 --> 1:06:25.260\n It really scares me.\n\n1:06:25.260 --> 1:06:28.300\n And here's where I just come back to.\n\n1:06:28.300 --> 1:06:32.220\n Just because we can create the metaverse,\n\n1:06:32.220 --> 1:06:36.380\n you know, just because it sounds like the next logical step\n\n1:06:36.380 --> 1:06:39.860\n in our digital revolution,\n\n1:06:39.860 --> 1:06:43.940\n do I really want my child's most significant moments\n\n1:06:43.940 --> 1:06:45.540\n to be online?\n\n1:06:45.540 --> 1:06:47.940\n They weren't for me, you know?\n\n1:06:47.940 --> 1:06:51.940\n So maybe I'm just stuck in that old school thinking,\n\n1:06:51.940 --> 1:06:54.580\n or maybe I've seen too much.\n\n1:06:54.580 --> 1:06:58.420\n And I'm really sick of being\n\n1:06:58.420 --> 1:07:01.740\n the guinea pig parent generation for these things.\n\n1:07:01.740 --> 1:07:04.380\n I mean, it's hard enough with screen time.\n\n1:07:04.380 --> 1:07:09.380\n Like thinking about how to manage the metaverse as a parent\n\n1:07:10.260 --> 1:07:13.660\n to a young boy, like I can't even let my head go there.\n\n1:07:13.660 --> 1:07:16.300\n That's so terrifying for me.\n\n1:07:16.300 --> 1:07:21.300\n But we've never stopped any new technology\n\n1:07:21.300 --> 1:07:23.980\n just because it introduces risks.\n\n1:07:23.980 --> 1:07:27.860\n We've always said, okay, the promise of this technology\n\n1:07:27.860 --> 1:07:31.700\n means we should keep going, keep pressing ahead.\n\n1:07:31.700 --> 1:07:35.500\n We just need to figure out new ways to manage that risk.\n\n1:07:35.500 --> 1:07:39.900\n And you know, that's the blockchain right now.\n\n1:07:39.900 --> 1:07:44.820\n Like when I was covering all of these ransomware attacks,\n\n1:07:44.820 --> 1:07:48.660\n I thought, okay, this is gonna be it for cryptocurrency.\n\n1:07:48.660 --> 1:07:51.380\n You know, governments are gonna put the kibosh down.\n\n1:07:51.380 --> 1:07:54.380\n They're gonna put the hammer down and say enough is enough.\n\n1:07:54.380 --> 1:07:56.900\n Like we have to put this genie back in the bottle\n\n1:07:56.900 --> 1:07:58.540\n because it's enabled ransomware.\n\n1:07:58.540 --> 1:08:02.700\n I mean, five years ago, they would hijack your PC\n\n1:08:02.700 --> 1:08:05.500\n and they'd say, go to the local pharmacy,\n\n1:08:05.500 --> 1:08:08.340\n get a eGift card and tell us what the pin is.\n\n1:08:08.340 --> 1:08:10.420\n And then we'll get your $200.\n\n1:08:10.420 --> 1:08:13.420\n Now it's pay us, you know, five Bitcoin.\n\n1:08:13.420 --> 1:08:16.140\n And so there's no doubt cryptocurrencies\n\n1:08:16.140 --> 1:08:17.820\n enabled ransomware attacks,\n\n1:08:17.820 --> 1:08:22.540\n but after the Colonial Pipeline ransom was seized,\n\n1:08:22.540 --> 1:08:25.700\n because if you remember, the FBI was actually able to go in\n\n1:08:25.700 --> 1:08:28.100\n and claw some of it back from DarkSide,\n\n1:08:28.100 --> 1:08:30.260\n which was the ransomware group that hid it.\n\n1:08:31.140 --> 1:08:34.060\n And I spoke to these guys at TRM Labs.\n\n1:08:34.060 --> 1:08:37.460\n So they're one of these blockchain intelligence companies.\n\n1:08:37.460 --> 1:08:38.660\n And a lot of people that work there\n\n1:08:38.660 --> 1:08:40.860\n used to work at the treasury.\n\n1:08:40.860 --> 1:08:42.140\n And what they said to me was,\n\n1:08:42.140 --> 1:08:46.420\n yeah, cryptocurrency has enabled ransomware,\n\n1:08:46.420 --> 1:08:51.420\n but to track down that ransom payment would have taken,\n\n1:08:52.100 --> 1:08:54.780\n you know, if we were dealing with fiat currency,\n\n1:08:54.780 --> 1:08:58.340\n would have taken us years to get to that one bank account\n\n1:08:58.340 --> 1:09:01.500\n or belonging to that one front company in the Seychelles.\n\n1:09:01.500 --> 1:09:04.060\n And now thanks to the blockchain,\n\n1:09:04.060 --> 1:09:08.340\n we can track the movement of those funds in real time.\n\n1:09:08.340 --> 1:09:09.500\n And you know what?\n\n1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:11.980\n You know, these payments are not as anonymous\n\n1:09:11.980 --> 1:09:13.300\n as people think.\n\n1:09:13.300 --> 1:09:16.660\n Like we still can use our old hacking ways and zero days\n\n1:09:16.660 --> 1:09:19.540\n and, you know, old school intelligence methods\n\n1:09:19.540 --> 1:09:21.780\n to find out who owns that private wallet\n\n1:09:21.780 --> 1:09:23.460\n and how to get to it.\n\n1:09:23.460 --> 1:09:27.620\n So it's a curse in some ways and that it's an enabler,\n\n1:09:27.620 --> 1:09:29.420\n but it's also a blessing.\n\n1:09:29.420 --> 1:09:31.220\n And they said that same thing to me\n\n1:09:31.220 --> 1:09:32.060\n that I just said to you.\n\n1:09:32.060 --> 1:09:37.060\n They said, we've never shut down a promising new technology\n\n1:09:37.460 --> 1:09:39.140\n because it introduced risk.\n\n1:09:39.140 --> 1:09:42.660\n We just figured out how to manage that risk.\n\n1:09:42.660 --> 1:09:44.380\n And I think that's where the conversation\n\n1:09:44.380 --> 1:09:45.820\n unfortunately has to go,\n\n1:09:45.820 --> 1:09:50.820\n is how do we in the metaverse use technology to fix things?\n\n1:09:53.580 --> 1:09:56.980\n So maybe we'll finally be able to, not finally,\n\n1:09:56.980 --> 1:10:00.940\n but figure out a way to solve the identity problem\n\n1:10:00.940 --> 1:10:03.380\n on the internet, meaning like a blue check mark\n\n1:10:03.380 --> 1:10:06.940\n for actual human and connect it to identity\n\n1:10:06.940 --> 1:10:11.340\n or like a fingerprint so you can prove your you.\n\n1:10:11.340 --> 1:10:15.740\n And yet do it in a way that doesn't involve the company\n\n1:10:15.740 --> 1:10:17.540\n having all your data.\n\n1:10:17.540 --> 1:10:20.740\n So giving you, allowing you to maintain control\n\n1:10:20.740 --> 1:10:23.780\n over your data, or if you don't,\n\n1:10:23.780 --> 1:10:25.940\n then there's a complete transparency\n\n1:10:25.940 --> 1:10:28.860\n of how that data is being used, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:10:28.860 --> 1:10:31.980\n And maybe as you educate more and more people,\n\n1:10:32.900 --> 1:10:36.060\n they would demand in a capitalist society\n\n1:10:36.060 --> 1:10:38.420\n that the companies that they give their data to\n\n1:10:38.420 --> 1:10:40.980\n will respect that data.\n\n1:10:40.980 --> 1:10:43.580\n Yeah, I mean, there is this company,\n\n1:10:43.580 --> 1:10:48.500\n and I hope they succeed, their name's PII Ono, Piano.\n\n1:10:48.500 --> 1:10:52.140\n And they wanna create a vault for your personal information\n\n1:10:52.140 --> 1:10:54.380\n inside every organization.\n\n1:10:54.380 --> 1:10:57.940\n And ultimately, if I'm gonna call Delta Airlines\n\n1:10:57.940 --> 1:10:59.380\n to book a flight,\n\n1:10:59.380 --> 1:11:02.420\n they don't need to know my social security number.\n\n1:11:02.420 --> 1:11:05.460\n They don't need to know my birth date.\n\n1:11:05.460 --> 1:11:08.860\n They're just gonna send me a one time token to my phone.\n\n1:11:08.860 --> 1:11:11.700\n My phone's gonna say, or my Fido key is gonna say,\n\n1:11:11.700 --> 1:11:13.460\n yep, it's her.\n\n1:11:13.460 --> 1:11:16.820\n And then we're gonna talk about my identity like a token,\n\n1:11:16.820 --> 1:11:17.660\n some random token.\n\n1:11:17.660 --> 1:11:20.060\n They don't need to know exactly who I am.\n\n1:11:20.060 --> 1:11:23.780\n They just need to know the system trust that I am,\n\n1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:27.900\n who I say I am, but they don't get access to my PII data.\n\n1:11:27.900 --> 1:11:30.340\n They don't get access to my social security number,\n\n1:11:30.340 --> 1:11:34.780\n my location, or the fact I'm a Times journalist.\n\n1:11:34.780 --> 1:11:37.380\n I think that's the way the world's gonna go.\n\n1:11:37.380 --> 1:11:40.780\n We have, enough is enough on sort of\n\n1:11:40.780 --> 1:11:44.100\n losing our personal information everywhere,\n\n1:11:44.100 --> 1:11:48.900\n letting data marketing companies track our every move.\n\n1:11:48.900 --> 1:11:51.020\n They don't need to know who I am.\n\n1:11:51.020 --> 1:11:52.500\n Okay, I get it.\n\n1:11:52.500 --> 1:11:57.460\n We're stuck in this world where the internet runs on ads.\n\n1:11:57.460 --> 1:11:59.940\n So ads are not gonna go away,\n\n1:11:59.940 --> 1:12:03.020\n but they don't need to know I'm Nicole Perlora.\n\n1:12:03.020 --> 1:12:06.580\n They can know that I am token number, you know,\n\n1:12:06.580 --> 1:12:08.660\n X567.\n\n1:12:08.660 --> 1:12:11.020\n And they can let you know what they know\n\n1:12:11.020 --> 1:12:14.020\n and give you control about removing the things they know.\n\n1:12:14.020 --> 1:12:15.820\n Yeah, right to be forgotten.\n\n1:12:15.820 --> 1:12:17.940\n To me, you should be able to walk away\n\n1:12:17.940 --> 1:12:20.260\n with a single press of a button.\n\n1:12:20.260 --> 1:12:22.060\n And I also believe that most people,\n\n1:12:22.060 --> 1:12:25.220\n given the choice to walk away, won't walk away.\n\n1:12:25.220 --> 1:12:28.540\n They'll just feel better about having the option\n\n1:12:28.540 --> 1:12:30.700\n to walk away when they understand the trade offs.\n\n1:12:30.700 --> 1:12:32.560\n If you walk away, you're not gonna get\n\n1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:34.140\n some of the personalized experiences\n\n1:12:34.140 --> 1:12:35.980\n that you would otherwise get,\n\n1:12:35.980 --> 1:12:38.580\n like a personalized feed and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:12:38.580 --> 1:12:40.900\n But the freedom to walk away is,\n\n1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:44.220\n I think, really powerful.\n\n1:12:44.220 --> 1:12:45.460\n And obviously, what you're saying,\n\n1:12:45.460 --> 1:12:48.620\n it's definitely, there's all of these HTML forms\n\n1:12:48.620 --> 1:12:51.220\n where you have to enter your phone number and email\n\n1:12:51.220 --> 1:12:54.740\n and private information from Delta, every single airline.\n\n1:12:55.780 --> 1:12:56.780\n New York Times.\n\n1:12:58.860 --> 1:13:00.580\n I have so many opinions on this.\n\n1:13:00.580 --> 1:13:03.420\n Just the friction and the sign up\n\n1:13:03.420 --> 1:13:04.840\n and all of those kinds of things.\n\n1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:07.200\n I should be able to, this has to do with everything.\n\n1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:08.860\n This has to do with payment, too.\n\n1:13:09.820 --> 1:13:11.780\n Payment should be trivial.\n\n1:13:11.780 --> 1:13:13.220\n It should be one click,\n\n1:13:13.220 --> 1:13:16.980\n and one click to unsubscribe and subscribe,\n\n1:13:16.980 --> 1:13:19.540\n and one click to provide all of your information\n\n1:13:19.540 --> 1:13:21.700\n that's necessary for the subscription service,\n\n1:13:21.700 --> 1:13:24.140\n for the transaction service, whatever that is,\n\n1:13:24.140 --> 1:13:25.940\n getting a ticket, as opposed to,\n\n1:13:25.940 --> 1:13:28.140\n I have all of these fake phone numbers and emails\n\n1:13:28.140 --> 1:13:29.380\n that I use in Alta Sign Up,\n\n1:13:29.380 --> 1:13:34.320\n because you never know if one site is hacked,\n\n1:13:34.320 --> 1:13:37.560\n then it's just going to propagate to everything else.\n\n1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:38.780\n Yeah.\n\n1:13:38.780 --> 1:13:41.080\n And there's low hanging fruit,\n\n1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:44.420\n and I hope Congress does something.\n\n1:13:44.420 --> 1:13:46.620\n And frankly, I think it's negligent they haven't\n\n1:13:46.620 --> 1:13:51.620\n on the fact that elderly people are getting spammed to death\n\n1:13:51.980 --> 1:13:56.460\n on their phones these days with fake car warranty scams.\n\n1:13:56.460 --> 1:13:59.500\n And I mean, my dad was in the hospital last year,\n\n1:13:59.500 --> 1:14:02.060\n and I was in the hospital room, and his phone kept buzzing,\n\n1:14:02.060 --> 1:14:07.060\n and I look at it, and it's just spam attack after spam attack,\n\n1:14:08.220 --> 1:14:13.180\n people nonstop calling about his freaking car warranty,\n\n1:14:13.180 --> 1:14:15.980\n why they're trying to get his social security number,\n\n1:14:15.980 --> 1:14:17.660\n they're trying to get his PII,\n\n1:14:17.660 --> 1:14:19.860\n they're trying to get this information.\n\n1:14:19.860 --> 1:14:24.020\n We need to figure out how to put those people\n\n1:14:24.020 --> 1:14:28.700\n in jail for life, and we need to figure out\n\n1:14:28.700 --> 1:14:32.500\n why in the hell we are being required\n\n1:14:32.500 --> 1:14:36.980\n or asked to hand over our social security number\n\n1:14:36.980 --> 1:14:39.900\n and our home address and our passport,\n\n1:14:39.900 --> 1:14:43.320\n all of that information to every retailer who asks.\n\n1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:45.200\n I mean, that's insanity.\n\n1:14:46.300 --> 1:14:49.740\n And there's no question they're not protecting it\n\n1:14:49.740 --> 1:14:54.740\n because it keeps showing up in spam or identity theft\n\n1:14:55.060 --> 1:14:57.060\n or credit card theft or worse.\n\n1:14:57.060 --> 1:15:00.200\n Well, spam is getting better, and maybe I need to,\n\n1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:02.580\n as a side note, make a public announcement.\n\n1:15:02.580 --> 1:15:07.360\n Please clip this out, which is if you get an email\n\n1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:11.420\n or a message from Lex Friedman saying how much\n\n1:15:12.380 --> 1:15:16.900\n I, Lex, appreciate you and love you and so on,\n\n1:15:16.900 --> 1:15:19.640\n and please connect with me on my WhatsApp number\n\n1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:23.420\n and I will give you Bitcoin or something like that,\n\n1:15:23.420 --> 1:15:25.020\n please do not click.\n\n1:15:25.020 --> 1:15:29.040\n And I'm aware that there's a lot of this going on,\n\n1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:30.120\n a very large amount.\n\n1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:32.180\n I can't do anything about it.\n\n1:15:32.180 --> 1:15:33.800\n This is on every single platform.\n\n1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:36.020\n It's happening more and more and more,\n\n1:15:36.020 --> 1:15:40.960\n which I've been recently informed that they're not emailing.\n\n1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:42.920\n So it's cross platform.\n\n1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:46.060\n They're taking people's, they're somehow,\n\n1:15:46.060 --> 1:15:50.500\n this is fascinating to me because they are taking people\n\n1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:53.860\n who comment on various social platforms\n\n1:15:53.860 --> 1:15:56.060\n and they somehow reverse engineer.\n\n1:15:56.060 --> 1:15:57.780\n They figure out what their email is\n\n1:15:57.780 --> 1:16:00.780\n and they send an email to that person saying,\n\n1:16:00.780 --> 1:16:04.060\n from Lex Friedman, and it's like a heartfelt email\n\n1:16:04.060 --> 1:16:05.180\n with links.\n\n1:16:05.180 --> 1:16:07.460\n It's fascinating because it's cross platform now.\n\n1:16:07.460 --> 1:16:11.060\n It's not just a spam bot that's messaging\n\n1:16:11.060 --> 1:16:13.500\n and a comment that's in a reply.\n\n1:16:13.500 --> 1:16:16.420\n They are saying, okay, this person cares\n\n1:16:16.420 --> 1:16:18.520\n about this other person on social media.\n\n1:16:18.520 --> 1:16:20.460\n So I'm going to find another channel,\n\n1:16:20.460 --> 1:16:22.660\n which in their mind probably increases\n\n1:16:22.660 --> 1:16:26.880\n and it does the likelihood that they'll get the people\n\n1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:28.980\n to click and they do.\n\n1:16:28.980 --> 1:16:30.180\n I don't know what to do about that.\n\n1:16:30.180 --> 1:16:32.180\n It makes me really, really sad,\n\n1:16:32.180 --> 1:16:33.740\n especially with podcasting.\n\n1:16:33.740 --> 1:16:36.780\n There's an intimacy that people feel connected\n\n1:16:36.780 --> 1:16:37.820\n and they get really excited.\n\n1:16:37.820 --> 1:16:40.480\n Okay, cool, I wanna talk to Lex.\n\n1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:43.860\n And they click.\n\n1:16:45.400 --> 1:16:50.400\n And I get angry at the people that do this.\n\n1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:55.800\n I mean, it's like the John that gets hired,\n\n1:16:55.800 --> 1:16:57.260\n the fake employee.\n\n1:16:57.260 --> 1:16:58.520\n I mean, I don't know what to do about that.\n\n1:16:58.520 --> 1:17:02.200\n I mean, I suppose the solution is education.\n\n1:17:02.200 --> 1:17:04.880\n It's telling people to be skeptical\n\n1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:07.020\n on the stuff they click.\n\n1:17:07.020 --> 1:17:09.520\n That balance with the technology solution\n\n1:17:09.520 --> 1:17:14.080\n of creating maybe like two factor authentication\n\n1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:17.840\n and maybe helping identify things\n\n1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:20.320\n that are likely to be spam, I don't know.\n\n1:17:20.320 --> 1:17:21.960\n But then the machine learning there is tricky\n\n1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:24.360\n because you don't wanna add a lot of extra friction\n\n1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:28.160\n that just annoys people because they'll turn it off.\n\n1:17:28.160 --> 1:17:30.680\n Because you have the accept cookies thing, right?\n\n1:17:30.680 --> 1:17:32.400\n That everybody has to click on now,\n\n1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:34.920\n so now they completely ignore the accept cookies.\n\n1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:39.920\n This is very difficult to find that frictionless security.\n\n1:17:42.200 --> 1:17:43.760\n You mentioned Snowden.\n\n1:17:43.760 --> 1:17:48.320\n You've talked about looking through the NSA documents\n\n1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:51.980\n he leaked and doing the hard work of that.\n\n1:17:51.980 --> 1:17:54.480\n What do you make of Edward Snowden?\n\n1:17:54.480 --> 1:17:56.680\n What have you learned from those documents?\n\n1:17:56.680 --> 1:17:57.980\n What do you think of him?\n\n1:18:00.680 --> 1:18:02.400\n In the long arc of history,\n\n1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:05.480\n is Edward Snowden a hero or a villain?\n\n1:18:05.480 --> 1:18:07.480\n I think he's neither.\n\n1:18:07.480 --> 1:18:11.440\n I have really complicated feelings about Edward Snowden.\n\n1:18:12.880 --> 1:18:15.740\n On the one hand, I'm a journalist at heart\n\n1:18:15.740 --> 1:18:19.560\n and more transparency is good.\n\n1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:22.560\n And I'm grateful for the conversations\n\n1:18:22.560 --> 1:18:26.180\n that we had in the post Snowden era\n\n1:18:26.180 --> 1:18:29.600\n about the limits to surveillance\n\n1:18:29.600 --> 1:18:33.080\n and how critical privacy is.\n\n1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:35.600\n And when you have no transparency\n\n1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:38.040\n and you don't really know in that case\n\n1:18:38.040 --> 1:18:40.040\n what our secret courts were doing,\n\n1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:45.640\n how can you truly believe that our country\n\n1:18:45.640 --> 1:18:47.840\n is taking our civil liberties seriously?\n\n1:18:48.900 --> 1:18:51.280\n So on the one hand, I'm grateful\n\n1:18:51.280 --> 1:18:54.900\n that he cracked open these debates.\n\n1:18:54.900 --> 1:18:59.900\n On the other hand, when I walked into the storage closet\n\n1:19:02.980 --> 1:19:05.900\n of classified NSA secrets,\n\n1:19:05.900 --> 1:19:09.460\n I had just spent two years\n\n1:19:09.460 --> 1:19:14.220\n covering Chinese cyber espionage almost every day.\n\n1:19:14.220 --> 1:19:19.220\n And the sort of advancement of Russian attacks\n\n1:19:19.380 --> 1:19:23.180\n that were just getting worse and worse and more destructive.\n\n1:19:23.180 --> 1:19:27.380\n And there were no limits to Chinese cyber espionage\n\n1:19:27.380 --> 1:19:30.660\n and Chinese surveillance of its own citizens.\n\n1:19:30.660 --> 1:19:32.800\n And there seemed to be no limit\n\n1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:37.240\n to what Russia was willing to do in terms of cyber attacks\n\n1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:41.260\n and also in some cases assassinating journalists.\n\n1:19:41.260 --> 1:19:43.980\n So when I walked into that room,\n\n1:19:43.980 --> 1:19:46.700\n there was a part of me quite honestly\n\n1:19:46.700 --> 1:19:50.000\n that was relieved to know that the NSA\n\n1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:53.500\n was as good as I hoped they were.\n\n1:19:53.500 --> 1:19:58.420\n And we weren't using that knowledge to,\n\n1:19:58.420 --> 1:20:02.220\n as far as I know, assassinate journalists.\n\n1:20:03.260 --> 1:20:06.240\n We weren't using our access\n\n1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:11.000\n to take out pharmaceutical companies.\n\n1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:15.580\n For the most part, we were using it for traditional espionage.\n\n1:20:15.580 --> 1:20:18.860\n Now, that set of documents also set me\n\n1:20:18.860 --> 1:20:22.020\n on the journey of my book because to me,\n\n1:20:22.020 --> 1:20:26.060\n the American people's reaction to the Snowden documents\n\n1:20:26.060 --> 1:20:28.860\n was a little bit misplaced.\n\n1:20:28.860 --> 1:20:29.860\n They were upset\n\n1:20:29.860 --> 1:20:33.980\n about the phone call metadata collection program.\n\n1:20:33.980 --> 1:20:36.340\n Angela Merkel, I think rightfully was upset\n\n1:20:36.340 --> 1:20:38.320\n that we were hacking her cell phone.\n\n1:20:39.340 --> 1:20:42.540\n But in sort of the spy eat spy world,\n\n1:20:42.540 --> 1:20:44.320\n hacking world leaders cell phones\n\n1:20:44.320 --> 1:20:47.300\n is pretty much what most spy agencies do.\n\n1:20:47.300 --> 1:20:51.580\n And there wasn't a lot that I saw in those documents\n\n1:20:51.580 --> 1:20:56.580\n that was beyond what I thought a spy agency does.\n\n1:20:56.580 --> 1:21:01.000\n And I think if there was another 9 11 tomorrow,\n\n1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:05.740\n God forbid, we would all say, how did the NSA miss this?\n\n1:21:05.740 --> 1:21:07.900\n Why weren't they spying on those terrorists?\n\n1:21:07.900 --> 1:21:10.780\n Why weren't they spying on those world leaders?\n\n1:21:10.780 --> 1:21:13.140\n And there's some of that too.\n\n1:21:13.140 --> 1:21:17.740\n But I think that there was great damage done\n\n1:21:17.740 --> 1:21:21.660\n to the US's reputation.\n\n1:21:22.900 --> 1:21:25.500\n I think we really lost our halo\n\n1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:30.460\n in terms of a protector of civil liberties.\n\n1:21:30.460 --> 1:21:33.680\n And I think a lot of what was reported\n\n1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:36.980\n was unfortunately reported in a vacuum.\n\n1:21:36.980 --> 1:21:41.980\n That was my biggest gripe that we were always reporting,\n\n1:21:41.980 --> 1:21:45.200\n the NSA has this program and here's what it does.\n\n1:21:45.200 --> 1:21:48.680\n And the NSA is in Angela Merkel's cell phone\n\n1:21:48.680 --> 1:21:50.760\n and the NSA can do this.\n\n1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:55.660\n And no one was saying, and by the way,\n\n1:21:57.040 --> 1:22:00.220\n China has been hacking into our pipelines\n\n1:22:00.220 --> 1:22:01.480\n and they've been making off\n\n1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:04.120\n with all of our intellectual property.\n\n1:22:04.120 --> 1:22:07.600\n And Russia has been hacking into our energy infrastructure\n\n1:22:07.600 --> 1:22:11.340\n and they've been using the same methods to spy on track.\n\n1:22:11.340 --> 1:22:13.960\n And in many cases, kill their own journalists.\n\n1:22:13.960 --> 1:22:15.780\n And the Saudis have been doing this\n\n1:22:15.780 --> 1:22:17.340\n to their own critics and dissidents.\n\n1:22:17.340 --> 1:22:21.240\n And so you can't talk about any of these countries\n\n1:22:21.240 --> 1:22:22.760\n in isolation.\n\n1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:25.880\n It is really like spy out there.\n\n1:22:25.880 --> 1:22:29.080\n And so I just have complicated feelings.\n\n1:22:29.080 --> 1:22:30.920\n And the other thing is, and I'm sorry,\n\n1:22:30.920 --> 1:22:32.040\n this is a little bit of a tangent,\n\n1:22:32.040 --> 1:22:37.040\n but the amount of documents that we had,\n\n1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:39.840\n like thousands of documents,\n\n1:22:39.840 --> 1:22:41.920\n most of which were just crap,\n\n1:22:41.920 --> 1:22:46.560\n but had people's names on them.\n\n1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:48.940\n Part of me wishes that those documents\n\n1:22:48.940 --> 1:22:53.040\n had been released in a much more targeted, limited way.\n\n1:22:53.040 --> 1:22:56.400\n It's just a lot of it just felt like a PowerPoint\n\n1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:58.620\n that was taken out of context.\n\n1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:03.040\n And you just sort of wish\n\n1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:05.920\n that there had been a little bit more thought\n\n1:23:05.920 --> 1:23:07.760\n into what was released.\n\n1:23:07.760 --> 1:23:10.120\n Because I think a lot of the impact from someone\n\n1:23:10.120 --> 1:23:13.420\n was just the volume of the reporting.\n\n1:23:13.420 --> 1:23:17.100\n But I think based on what I saw personally,\n\n1:23:18.480 --> 1:23:20.400\n there was a lot of stuff that I just,\n\n1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:24.140\n I don't know why that particular thing got released.\n\n1:23:24.140 --> 1:23:26.800\n As a whistleblower, what's a better way to do it?\n\n1:23:26.800 --> 1:23:28.160\n Because I mean, there's fear,\n\n1:23:28.160 --> 1:23:33.160\n it takes a lot of effort to do a more targeted release.\n\n1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:35.000\n If there's proper channels,\n\n1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:38.240\n you're afraid that those channels will be manipulated\n\n1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:39.480\n by who do you trust.\n\n1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:43.560\n What's a better way to do this, do you think?\n\n1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:46.600\n As a journalist, this is almost like a journalistic question.\n\n1:23:46.600 --> 1:23:49.620\n Reveal some fundamental flaw in the system\n\n1:23:49.620 --> 1:23:50.840\n without destroying the system.\n\n1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:54.840\n I bring up, again, Mark Zuckerberg and Metta,\n\n1:23:54.840 --> 1:23:57.720\n there was a whistleblower\n\n1:23:57.720 --> 1:24:02.080\n that came out about Instagram internal studies.\n\n1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:06.960\n And I also torn about how to feel about that whistleblower.\n\n1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:10.800\n Because from a company perspective, that's an open culture.\n\n1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:13.800\n How can you operate successfully\n\n1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:14.880\n if you have an open culture\n\n1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:17.900\n where any one whistleblower can come out,\n\n1:24:17.900 --> 1:24:19.360\n out of context, take a study,\n\n1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:21.800\n whether it represents a larger context or not,\n\n1:24:22.720 --> 1:24:25.400\n and the press eats it up.\n\n1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:27.960\n And then that creates a narrative\n\n1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:30.240\n that is just like with the NSA,\n\n1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:33.800\n you said it's out of context, very targeted,\n\n1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:36.720\n to where, well, Facebook is evil, clearly,\n\n1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:38.860\n because of this one leak.\n\n1:24:38.860 --> 1:24:40.520\n It's really hard to know what to do there,\n\n1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:42.040\n because we're now in a society\n\n1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:44.320\n that's deeply distrust institutions.\n\n1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:49.120\n And so narratives by whistleblowers make that whistleblower\n\n1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:52.240\n and their forthcoming book very popular.\n\n1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:54.080\n And so there's a huge incentive\n\n1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:56.800\n to take stuff out of context and to tell stories\n\n1:24:56.800 --> 1:25:00.360\n that don't represent the full context, the full truth.\n\n1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:03.120\n It's hard to know what to do with that,\n\n1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:06.940\n because then that forces Facebook and Meta and governments\n\n1:25:06.940 --> 1:25:09.780\n to be much more conservative, much more secretive.\n\n1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:14.600\n It's like a race to the bottom, I don't know.\n\n1:25:14.600 --> 1:25:16.280\n I don't know if you can comment on any of that,\n\n1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:19.320\n how to be a whistleblower ethically and properly.\n\n1:25:20.760 --> 1:25:23.400\n I don't know, I mean, these are hard questions.\n\n1:25:23.400 --> 1:25:27.240\n And even for myself, in some ways,\n\n1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:31.720\n I think of my book as sort of blowing the whistle\n\n1:25:31.720 --> 1:25:33.960\n on the underground zero day market.\n\n1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:38.840\n But it's not like I was in the market myself.\n\n1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:41.440\n It's not like I had access to classified data\n\n1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:43.440\n when I was reporting out that book.\n\n1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:46.800\n As I say in the book, listen,\n\n1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:49.500\n I'm just trying to scrape the surface here,\n\n1:25:49.500 --> 1:25:53.000\n so we can have these conversations before it's too late.\n\n1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:57.080\n And I'm sure there's plenty in there\n\n1:25:57.080 --> 1:26:01.760\n that someone who's US intelligence agencies\n\n1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:04.080\n preeminent zero day broker probably\n\n1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:05.940\n has some voodoo doll of me out there.\n\n1:26:05.940 --> 1:26:10.940\n And you're never gonna get it 100%.\n\n1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:14.880\n But I really applaud whistleblowers\n\n1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:19.040\n like the whistleblower who blew the whistle\n\n1:26:19.040 --> 1:26:22.320\n on the Trump call with Zelensky.\n\n1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:25.320\n I mean, people needed to know about that,\n\n1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:27.840\n that we were basically, in some ways,\n\n1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:32.840\n blackmailing an ally to try to influence an election.\n\n1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:37.280\n I mean, they went through the proper channels.\n\n1:26:37.280 --> 1:26:39.480\n They weren't trying to profit off of it, right?\n\n1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:42.120\n There was no book that came out afterwards\n\n1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:44.100\n from that whistleblower.\n\n1:26:44.100 --> 1:26:45.780\n That whistleblower's not like,\n\n1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:47.920\n they went through the channels.\n\n1:26:47.920 --> 1:26:51.160\n They're not living in Moscow, let's put it that way.\n\n1:26:51.160 --> 1:26:53.000\n Can I ask you a question, you mentioned NSA,\n\n1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:54.500\n one of the things that showed\n\n1:26:56.240 --> 1:26:58.240\n is they're pretty good at what they do.\n\n1:27:00.340 --> 1:27:03.520\n Again, this is a touchy subject, I suppose,\n\n1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:06.300\n but there's a lot of conspiracy theories\n\n1:27:06.300 --> 1:27:08.040\n about intelligence agencies.\n\n1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:11.200\n From your understanding of intelligence agencies,\n\n1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:16.020\n the CIA, NSA, and the equivalent of in other countries,\n\n1:27:16.940 --> 1:27:20.040\n are they, one question, this could be a dangerous question,\n\n1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:23.600\n are they competent, are they good at what they do?\n\n1:27:24.740 --> 1:27:28.920\n And two, are they malevolent in any way?\n\n1:27:30.600 --> 1:27:32.680\n Sort of, I recently had a conversation\n\n1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:35.180\n about tobacco companies.\n\n1:27:35.180 --> 1:27:39.560\n They kind of see their customers as dupes,\n\n1:27:39.560 --> 1:27:43.320\n like they can just play games with people.\n\n1:27:43.320 --> 1:27:46.440\n Conspiracy theories tell that similar story\n\n1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:48.540\n about intelligence agencies,\n\n1:27:48.540 --> 1:27:51.680\n that they're interested in manipulating the populace\n\n1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:54.920\n for whatever ends the powerful,\n\n1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:59.920\n in dark rooms, cigarette smoke, cigar smoke filled rooms.\n\n1:28:03.260 --> 1:28:04.620\n What's your sense?\n\n1:28:04.620 --> 1:28:09.620\n Do these conspiracy theories have any truth to them?\n\n1:28:11.400 --> 1:28:14.440\n Or are intelligence agencies, for the most part,\n\n1:28:14.440 --> 1:28:15.720\n good for society?\n\n1:28:15.720 --> 1:28:18.640\n Okay, well, that's an easy one.\n\n1:28:18.640 --> 1:28:19.480\n Is it?\n\n1:28:19.480 --> 1:28:23.720\n No, I think it depends which intelligence agency.\n\n1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:25.800\n Think about the Mossad.\n\n1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:30.800\n They're killing every Iranian nuclear scientist they can\n\n1:28:32.700 --> 1:28:37.700\n over the years, but have they delayed the time horizon\n\n1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:40.520\n before Iran gets the bomb?\n\n1:28:40.520 --> 1:28:41.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:45.840\n Have they probably staved off terror attacks\n\n1:28:45.840 --> 1:28:46.820\n on their own citizens?\n\n1:28:46.820 --> 1:28:47.660\n Yeah.\n\n1:28:48.680 --> 1:28:53.320\n You know, none of these, intelligence is intelligence.\n\n1:28:53.320 --> 1:28:56.400\n You know, you can't just say like they're malevolent\n\n1:28:56.400 --> 1:28:58.840\n or they're heroes.\n\n1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:02.680\n You know, everyone I have met in this space\n\n1:29:03.680 --> 1:29:07.440\n is not like the pound your chest patriot\n\n1:29:07.440 --> 1:29:11.560\n that you see on the beach on the 4th of July.\n\n1:29:11.560 --> 1:29:15.200\n A lot of them have complicated feelings\n\n1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:17.720\n about their former employers.\n\n1:29:17.720 --> 1:29:20.520\n Well, at least at the NSA reminded me\n\n1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:25.520\n to do what we were accused of doing after Snowden,\n\n1:29:25.880 --> 1:29:28.800\n to spy on Americans.\n\n1:29:28.800 --> 1:29:33.800\n You have no idea the amount of red tape and paperwork\n\n1:29:33.800 --> 1:29:38.320\n and bureaucracy it would have taken to do\n\n1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:41.180\n what everyone thinks that we were supposedly doing.\n\n1:29:42.500 --> 1:29:45.600\n But then, you know, we find out in the course\n\n1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:49.480\n of the Snowden reporting about a program called Lovin',\n\n1:29:49.480 --> 1:29:53.040\n where a couple of the NSA analysts were using their access\n\n1:29:53.040 --> 1:29:55.380\n to spy on their ex girlfriends.\n\n1:29:55.380 --> 1:29:59.300\n So, you know, there's an exception to every case.\n\n1:29:59.300 --> 1:30:04.300\n Generally, I will probably get, you know,\n\n1:30:05.020 --> 1:30:07.580\n accused of my Western bias here again,\n\n1:30:07.580 --> 1:30:12.580\n but I think you can almost barely compare\n\n1:30:15.060 --> 1:30:17.260\n some of these Western intelligence agencies\n\n1:30:17.260 --> 1:30:19.980\n to China, for instance.\n\n1:30:19.980 --> 1:30:24.980\n And the surveillance that they're deploying on the Uyghurs\n\n1:30:26.020 --> 1:30:28.940\n to the level they're deploying it.\n\n1:30:28.940 --> 1:30:32.100\n And the surveillance they're starting to export abroad\n\n1:30:32.100 --> 1:30:33.180\n with some of the programs,\n\n1:30:33.180 --> 1:30:35.500\n like the watering hole attack I mentioned earlier,\n\n1:30:35.500 --> 1:30:38.980\n where it's not just hitting the Uyghurs inside China,\n\n1:30:38.980 --> 1:30:40.340\n it's hitting anyone interested\n\n1:30:40.340 --> 1:30:42.060\n in the Uyghur plight outside China.\n\n1:30:42.060 --> 1:30:44.580\n I mean, it could be an American high school student\n\n1:30:44.580 --> 1:30:46.540\n writing a paper on the Uyghurs.\n\n1:30:46.540 --> 1:30:49.100\n They wanna spy on that person too.\n\n1:30:49.100 --> 1:30:51.740\n You know, there's no rules in China\n\n1:30:51.740 --> 1:30:55.460\n really limiting the extent of that surveillance.\n\n1:30:55.460 --> 1:30:59.340\n And we all better pay attention to what's happening\n\n1:30:59.340 --> 1:31:04.060\n with the Uyghurs because just as Ukraine has been to Russia\n\n1:31:04.060 --> 1:31:08.240\n in terms of a test kitchen for its cyber attacks,\n\n1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:12.900\n the Uyghurs are China's test kitchen for surveillance.\n\n1:31:12.900 --> 1:31:15.300\n And there's no doubt in my mind\n\n1:31:15.300 --> 1:31:17.660\n that they're testing them on the Uyghurs.\n\n1:31:17.660 --> 1:31:19.140\n Uyghurs are their Petri dish,\n\n1:31:19.140 --> 1:31:21.220\n and eventually they will export\n\n1:31:21.220 --> 1:31:23.880\n that level of surveillance overseas.\n\n1:31:23.880 --> 1:31:26.480\n I mean, in 2015,\n\n1:31:27.360 --> 1:31:31.700\n Obama and Xi Jinping reached a deal\n\n1:31:31.700 --> 1:31:34.540\n where basically the White House said,\n\n1:31:34.540 --> 1:31:38.620\n you better cut it out on intellectual property theft.\n\n1:31:38.620 --> 1:31:40.140\n And so they made this agreement\n\n1:31:40.140 --> 1:31:43.620\n that they would not hack each other for commercial benefit.\n\n1:31:43.620 --> 1:31:45.700\n And for a period of about 18 months,\n\n1:31:45.700 --> 1:31:49.060\n we saw this huge drop off in Chinese cyber attacks\n\n1:31:49.060 --> 1:31:50.820\n on American companies.\n\n1:31:50.820 --> 1:31:53.080\n But some of them continued.\n\n1:31:53.080 --> 1:31:54.300\n Where did they continue?\n\n1:31:54.300 --> 1:31:58.420\n They continued on aviation companies,\n\n1:31:58.420 --> 1:32:01.100\n on hospitality companies like Marriott.\n\n1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:02.900\n Why?\n\n1:32:02.900 --> 1:32:05.740\n Because that was still considered fair game to China.\n\n1:32:05.740 --> 1:32:07.420\n It wasn't IP theft they were after.\n\n1:32:07.420 --> 1:32:11.860\n They wanted to know who was staying in this city\n\n1:32:11.860 --> 1:32:15.020\n at this time when Chinese citizens were staying there\n\n1:32:15.020 --> 1:32:17.440\n so they could cross match for counterintelligence\n\n1:32:17.440 --> 1:32:20.220\n who might be a likely Chinese spy.\n\n1:32:20.220 --> 1:32:22.720\n I'm sure we're doing some of that too.\n\n1:32:22.720 --> 1:32:24.780\n Counterintelligence is counterintelligence.\n\n1:32:24.780 --> 1:32:26.300\n It's considered fair game.\n\n1:32:27.460 --> 1:32:30.420\n But where I think it gets evil\n\n1:32:30.420 --> 1:32:34.220\n is when you use it for censorship,\n\n1:32:34.220 --> 1:32:36.100\n to suppress any dissent,\n\n1:32:37.300 --> 1:32:41.780\n to do what I've seen the UAE do to its citizens\n\n1:32:41.780 --> 1:32:44.180\n where people who've gone on Twitter\n\n1:32:44.180 --> 1:32:47.580\n just to advocate for better voting rights,\n\n1:32:47.580 --> 1:32:49.360\n more enfranchisement,\n\n1:32:49.360 --> 1:32:53.500\n suddenly find their passports confiscated.\n\n1:32:53.500 --> 1:32:57.340\n You know, I talked to one critic, Ahmed Mansour,\n\n1:32:57.340 --> 1:32:58.700\n and he told me,\n\n1:32:58.700 --> 1:33:01.060\n you know, you might find yourself a terrorist,\n\n1:33:01.060 --> 1:33:02.420\n labeled a terrorist one day,\n\n1:33:02.420 --> 1:33:04.700\n you don't even know how to operate a gun.\n\n1:33:04.700 --> 1:33:06.520\n I mean, he had been beaten up\n\n1:33:06.520 --> 1:33:07.980\n every time he tried to go somewhere.\n\n1:33:07.980 --> 1:33:09.660\n His passport had been confiscated.\n\n1:33:09.660 --> 1:33:10.600\n By that point, it turned out\n\n1:33:10.600 --> 1:33:12.100\n they'd already hacked into his phone\n\n1:33:12.100 --> 1:33:14.160\n so they were listening to us talking.\n\n1:33:14.160 --> 1:33:16.300\n They'd hacked into his baby monitor\n\n1:33:16.300 --> 1:33:18.900\n so they're spying on his child.\n\n1:33:18.900 --> 1:33:21.340\n And they stole his car.\n\n1:33:22.340 --> 1:33:24.680\n And then they created a new law\n\n1:33:24.680 --> 1:33:27.780\n that you couldn't criticize the ruling family\n\n1:33:27.780 --> 1:33:29.380\n or the ruling party on Twitter.\n\n1:33:29.380 --> 1:33:32.720\n And he's been in solitary confinement every day since\n\n1:33:32.720 --> 1:33:34.180\n on hunger strike.\n\n1:33:34.180 --> 1:33:37.760\n So that's evil, you know, that's evil.\n\n1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:40.200\n And we still, we don't do that here.\n\n1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:42.060\n You know, we have rules here.\n\n1:33:42.060 --> 1:33:44.500\n We don't cross that line.\n\n1:33:44.500 --> 1:33:48.540\n So yeah, in some cases, like I won't go to Dubai.\n\n1:33:48.540 --> 1:33:49.980\n You know, I won't go to Abu Dhabi.\n\n1:33:49.980 --> 1:33:51.580\n If I ever want to go to the Maldives,\n\n1:33:51.580 --> 1:33:54.860\n like too bad, like most of the flights go through Dubai.\n\n1:33:54.860 --> 1:33:57.140\n So there's some lines we're not willing to cross.\n\n1:33:57.140 --> 1:33:58.940\n But then again, just like you said,\n\n1:33:58.940 --> 1:34:02.660\n there's individuals within NSA, within CIA,\n\n1:34:02.660 --> 1:34:05.780\n and they may have power.\n\n1:34:05.780 --> 1:34:07.860\n And to me, there's levels of evil.\n\n1:34:07.860 --> 1:34:11.300\n To me personally, this is the stuff of conspiracy theories,\n\n1:34:11.300 --> 1:34:13.880\n is the things you've mentioned as evil\n\n1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:16.140\n are more direct attacks.\n\n1:34:16.140 --> 1:34:19.140\n But there's also psychological warfare.\n\n1:34:19.140 --> 1:34:20.800\n So blackmail.\n\n1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:25.580\n So what does spying allow you to do?\n\n1:34:25.580 --> 1:34:27.820\n Allow you to collect information\n\n1:34:27.820 --> 1:34:30.140\n if you have something that's embarrassing.\n\n1:34:30.140 --> 1:34:33.580\n Or if you have like Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theories,\n\n1:34:33.580 --> 1:34:38.460\n active, what is it, manufacture of embarrassing things.\n\n1:34:38.460 --> 1:34:41.080\n And then use blackmail to manipulate the population\n\n1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:42.860\n or all the powerful people involved.\n\n1:34:42.860 --> 1:34:45.820\n It troubles me deeply that MIT allowed somebody\n\n1:34:45.820 --> 1:34:48.580\n like Jeffrey Epstein in their midst,\n\n1:34:48.580 --> 1:34:51.620\n especially some of the scientists I admire\n\n1:34:51.620 --> 1:34:54.260\n that they would hang out with that person at all.\n\n1:34:54.260 --> 1:34:57.840\n And so I'll talk about it sometimes.\n\n1:34:59.020 --> 1:35:00.260\n And then a lot of people tell me,\n\n1:35:00.260 --> 1:35:04.340\n well, obviously Jeffrey Epstein is a front for intelligence.\n\n1:35:04.340 --> 1:35:09.340\n And I just, I struggle to see that level of competence\n\n1:35:09.640 --> 1:35:10.720\n and malevolence.\n\n1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:15.720\n But, you know, who the hell am I?\n\n1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:21.200\n And I guess I was trying to get to that point.\n\n1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:23.000\n You said that there's bureaucracy and so on,\n\n1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:25.740\n which makes some of these things very difficult.\n\n1:35:25.740 --> 1:35:27.440\n I wonder how much malevolence,\n\n1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:31.640\n how much competence there is in these institutions.\n\n1:35:31.640 --> 1:35:34.880\n Like how far, this takes us back to the hacking question.\n\n1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:39.880\n How far are people willing to go if they have the power?\n\n1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:41.720\n This has to do with social engineering.\n\n1:35:41.720 --> 1:35:42.800\n This has to do with hacking.\n\n1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:45.440\n This has to do with manipulating people,\n\n1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:47.360\n attacking people, doing evil onto people,\n\n1:35:47.360 --> 1:35:50.280\n psychological warfare and stuff like that.\n\n1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:51.500\n I don't know.\n\n1:35:51.500 --> 1:35:54.000\n I believe that most people are good.\n\n1:35:54.860 --> 1:35:59.400\n And I don't think that's possible in a free society.\n\n1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:00.460\n There's something that happens\n\n1:36:00.460 --> 1:36:02.560\n when you have a centralized government\n\n1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:05.600\n where power corrupts over time\n\n1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:08.880\n and you start surveillance programs\n\n1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:12.120\n kind of, it's like a slippery slope\n\n1:36:12.120 --> 1:36:16.680\n that over time starts to both use fear\n\n1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:20.060\n and direct manipulation to control the populace.\n\n1:36:20.060 --> 1:36:22.240\n But in a free society, I just,\n\n1:36:23.680 --> 1:36:25.120\n it's difficult for me to imagine\n\n1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:27.720\n that you can have like somebody like a Jeffrey Epstein\n\n1:36:27.720 --> 1:36:29.400\n in the front for intelligence.\n\n1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:31.640\n I don't know what I'm asking you, but I'm just,\n\n1:36:34.780 --> 1:36:36.960\n I have a hope that for the most part,\n\n1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:39.880\n intelligence agencies are trying to do good\n\n1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:41.920\n and are actually doing good for the world\n\n1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:45.720\n when you view it in the full context\n\n1:36:45.720 --> 1:36:47.740\n of the complexities of the world.\n\n1:36:51.640 --> 1:36:55.200\n But then again, if they're not, would we know?\n\n1:36:55.200 --> 1:36:58.400\n That's why Edward Snowden might be a good thing.\n\n1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:00.520\n Let me ask you on a personal question.\n\n1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:02.480\n You have investigated some of the most powerful\n\n1:37:02.480 --> 1:37:04.520\n organizations and people in the world\n\n1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:07.620\n of cyber warfare, cyber security.\n\n1:37:07.620 --> 1:37:09.600\n Are you ever afraid for your own life,\n\n1:37:09.600 --> 1:37:13.240\n your own wellbeing, digital or physical?\n\n1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:15.520\n I mean, I've had my moments.\n\n1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:20.080\n You know, I've had our security team at the times\n\n1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:21.960\n called me at one point and said,\n\n1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:25.800\n someone's on the dark web offering good money\n\n1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:28.860\n to anyone who can hack your phone or your laptop.\n\n1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:33.000\n I describe in my book how when I was at that\n\n1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:35.240\n hacking conference in Argentina and I came back\n\n1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:38.680\n and I brought a burner laptop with me,\n\n1:37:38.680 --> 1:37:40.760\n but I'd kept it in the safe anyway\n\n1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:42.480\n and it didn't have anything on it,\n\n1:37:42.480 --> 1:37:45.320\n but someone had broken in and it was moved.\n\n1:37:46.640 --> 1:37:51.640\n You know, I've had all sorts of sort of scary moments.\n\n1:37:52.760 --> 1:37:55.520\n And then I've had moments where I think I went\n\n1:37:55.520 --> 1:37:58.920\n just way too far into the paranoid side.\n\n1:37:58.920 --> 1:38:03.920\n I mean, I remember writing about the Times hack by China\n\n1:38:04.600 --> 1:38:07.460\n and I just covered a number of Chinese cyber attacks\n\n1:38:07.460 --> 1:38:10.080\n where they'd gotten into the thermostat\n\n1:38:10.080 --> 1:38:11.600\n at someone's corporate apartment\n\n1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:15.820\n and they'd gotten into all sorts of stuff.\n\n1:38:15.820 --> 1:38:17.760\n And I was living by myself.\n\n1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:22.760\n I was single in San Francisco and my cable box\n\n1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:25.560\n on my television started making some weird noises\n\n1:38:25.560 --> 1:38:26.960\n in the middle of the night.\n\n1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:29.680\n And I got up and I ripped it out of the wall\n\n1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:32.080\n and I think I said something like embarrassing,\n\n1:38:32.080 --> 1:38:33.760\n like, fuck you China, you know.\n\n1:38:33.760 --> 1:38:38.760\n And then I went back to bed and I woke up\n\n1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:41.640\n and it's like beautiful morning light.\n\n1:38:41.640 --> 1:38:42.560\n I mean, I'll never forget it.\n\n1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:44.600\n Like this is like glimmering morning light\n\n1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:48.120\n is shining on my cable box, which has now been ripped out\n\n1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:50.640\n and is sitting on my floor and like the morning light.\n\n1:38:50.640 --> 1:38:53.840\n And I was just like, no, no, no,\n\n1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:56.920\n like I'm not going down that road.\n\n1:38:56.920 --> 1:39:01.920\n Like you basically, I came to a fork in the road\n\n1:39:03.400 --> 1:39:06.120\n where I could either go full tinfoil hat,\n\n1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:10.040\n go live off the grid, never have a car with navigation,\n\n1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:12.480\n never use Google maps, never own an iPhone,\n\n1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:17.480\n never order diapers off Amazon, you know, create an alias\n\n1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:22.240\n or I could just do the best I can\n\n1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:26.040\n and live in this new digital world we're living in.\n\n1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:28.080\n And what does that look like for me?\n\n1:39:28.080 --> 1:39:30.760\n I mean, what are my crown jewels?\n\n1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:32.760\n This is what I tell people, what are your crown jewels?\n\n1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:34.200\n Cause just focus on that.\n\n1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:35.620\n You can't protect everything,\n\n1:39:35.620 --> 1:39:37.480\n but you can protect your crown jewels.\n\n1:39:37.480 --> 1:39:39.000\n For me, for the longest time,\n\n1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:42.320\n my crown jewels were my sources.\n\n1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:44.520\n I was nothing without my sources.\n\n1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:49.420\n So I had some sources, I would meet the same dim sum place\n\n1:39:49.420 --> 1:39:53.760\n or maybe it was a different restaurant on the same date,\n\n1:39:53.760 --> 1:39:58.760\n you know, every quarter and we would never drive there.\n\n1:39:59.040 --> 1:40:00.360\n We would never Uber there.\n\n1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:02.040\n We wouldn't bring any devices.\n\n1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:05.000\n I could bring a pencil and a notepad.\n\n1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.160\n And if someone wasn't in town,\n\n1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:09.120\n like there were a couple of times where I'd show up\n\n1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:11.120\n and the source never came,\n\n1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:14.000\n but we never communicated digitally.\n\n1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.440\n And those were the links I was willing to go\n\n1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:19.520\n to protect that source, but you can't do it for everyone.\n\n1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:22.300\n So for everyone else, you know, it was signal,\n\n1:40:22.300 --> 1:40:24.520\n using two factor authentication,\n\n1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:26.960\n you know, keeping my devices up to date,\n\n1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:30.640\n not clicking on phishing emails, using a password manager,\n\n1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:34.480\n all the things that we know we're supposed to do.\n\n1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:37.320\n And that's what I tell everyone, like don't go crazy\n\n1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:39.280\n because then that's like the ultimate hack.\n\n1:40:39.280 --> 1:40:43.620\n Then they've hacked your mind, whoever they is for you.\n\n1:40:43.620 --> 1:40:45.200\n But just do the best you can.\n\n1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:50.200\n Now, my whole risk model changed when I had a kid.\n\n1:40:50.200 --> 1:40:54.720\n You know, now it's, oh God, you know,\n\n1:40:54.720 --> 1:40:59.720\n if anyone threatened my family, God help them.\n\n1:40:59.960 --> 1:41:04.960\n But it changes you.\n\n1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:12.340\n And, you know, unfortunately there are some things,\n\n1:41:12.340 --> 1:41:15.000\n like I was really scared to go deep on,\n\n1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:19.540\n like Russian cyber crime, you know, like Putin himself,\n\n1:41:19.540 --> 1:41:21.240\n you know, and it's interesting.\n\n1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:24.600\n Like I have a mentor who's an incredible person\n\n1:41:24.600 --> 1:41:29.560\n who was the Times Moscow Bureau Chief during the Cold War.\n\n1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:32.040\n And after I wrote a series of stories\n\n1:41:32.040 --> 1:41:35.040\n about Chinese cyber espionage, he took me out to lunch.\n\n1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:37.960\n And he told me that when he was living in Moscow,\n\n1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:40.100\n he would drop his kids off at preschool\n\n1:41:40.100 --> 1:41:42.640\n when they were my son's age now.\n\n1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:44.800\n And the KGB would follow him\n\n1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:48.280\n and they would make a really like loud show of it.\n\n1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:51.360\n You know, they'd tail him, they'd, you know, honk,\n\n1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:55.240\n they'd just be, make a ruckus.\n\n1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:57.640\n And he said, you know what, they never actually did anything\n\n1:41:57.640 --> 1:42:00.760\n but they wanted me to know that they were following me\n\n1:42:00.760 --> 1:42:03.000\n and I operated accordingly.\n\n1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:05.840\n And he says, that's how you should operate\n\n1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:08.200\n in the digital world.\n\n1:42:08.200 --> 1:42:11.660\n Know that there are probably people following you.\n\n1:42:11.660 --> 1:42:14.400\n Sometimes they'll make a little bit of noise.\n\n1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:17.540\n But one thing you need to know is that\n\n1:42:17.540 --> 1:42:18.620\n while you're at the New York Times,\n\n1:42:18.620 --> 1:42:21.360\n you have a little bit of an invisible shield on you.\n\n1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:23.660\n You know, if something were to happen to you,\n\n1:42:23.660 --> 1:42:25.080\n that would be a really big deal.\n\n1:42:25.080 --> 1:42:27.000\n That would be an international incident.\n\n1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.900\n So I kind of carried that invisible shield with me\n\n1:42:29.900 --> 1:42:31.540\n for years.\n\n1:42:31.540 --> 1:42:34.360\n And then Jamal Khashoggi happened.\n\n1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:38.480\n And that destroyed my vision of my invisible shield.\n\n1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:41.980\n You know, sure, you know, he was a Saudi\n\n1:42:41.980 --> 1:42:44.820\n but he was a Washington Post columnist.\n\n1:42:44.820 --> 1:42:46.160\n You know, for the most part,\n\n1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:47.320\n he was living in the United States.\n\n1:42:47.320 --> 1:42:49.240\n He was a journalist.\n\n1:42:49.240 --> 1:42:52.820\n And for them to do what they did to him,\n\n1:42:52.820 --> 1:42:57.320\n pretty much in the open and get away with it,\n\n1:42:57.320 --> 1:43:01.080\n and for the United States to let them get away with it\n\n1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:04.660\n because we wanted to preserve diplomatic relations\n\n1:43:04.660 --> 1:43:06.040\n with the Saudis,\n\n1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:10.500\n that really threw my worldview upside down.\n\n1:43:10.500 --> 1:43:13.740\n And, you know, I think that sent a message\n\n1:43:13.740 --> 1:43:15.580\n to a lot of countries\n\n1:43:15.580 --> 1:43:19.500\n that it was sort of open season on journalists.\n\n1:43:19.500 --> 1:43:22.960\n And to me, that was one of the most destructive things\n\n1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:27.360\n that happened under the previous administration.\n\n1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:30.240\n And, you know, I don't really know\n\n1:43:30.240 --> 1:43:32.280\n what to think of my invisible shield anymore.\n\n1:43:32.280 --> 1:43:33.700\n Like you said, that really worries me\n\n1:43:33.700 --> 1:43:36.420\n on the journalism side that people would be afraid\n\n1:43:36.420 --> 1:43:39.040\n to dig deep on fascinating topics.\n\n1:43:41.080 --> 1:43:44.340\n And, you know, I have my own,\n\n1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:50.160\n part of the reason, like I would love to have kids,\n\n1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:51.660\n I would love to have a family.\n\n1:43:52.700 --> 1:43:56.680\n Part of the reason I'm a little bit afraid,\n\n1:43:56.680 --> 1:43:57.940\n there's many ways to phrase this,\n\n1:43:57.940 --> 1:44:02.480\n but the loss of freedom in the way of doing\n\n1:44:02.480 --> 1:44:04.980\n all the crazy shit that I naturally do,\n\n1:44:04.980 --> 1:44:07.900\n which I would say the ethic of journalism\n\n1:44:07.900 --> 1:44:09.900\n is kind of not, is doing crazy shit\n\n1:44:09.900 --> 1:44:11.160\n without really thinking about it.\n\n1:44:11.160 --> 1:44:13.400\n This is letting your curiosity\n\n1:44:14.360 --> 1:44:18.460\n really allow you to be free and explore.\n\n1:44:18.460 --> 1:44:22.040\n It's, I mean, whether it's stupidity or fearlessness,\n\n1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:25.240\n whatever it is, that's what great journalism is.\n\n1:44:25.240 --> 1:44:30.180\n And all the concerns about security risks\n\n1:44:30.180 --> 1:44:32.760\n have made me like become a better person.\n\n1:44:32.760 --> 1:44:35.600\n The way I approach it is just make sure\n\n1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:37.280\n you don't have anything to hide.\n\n1:44:37.280 --> 1:44:38.960\n I know this is not a thing.\n\n1:44:38.960 --> 1:44:41.860\n This is not a, this is not an approach to security.\n\n1:44:41.860 --> 1:44:44.920\n I'm just, this is like a motivational speech or something.\n\n1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:47.320\n It's just like, if you can lose,\n\n1:44:47.320 --> 1:44:49.220\n you can be hacked at any moment.\n\n1:44:49.220 --> 1:44:52.120\n Just don't be a douchebag secretly.\n\n1:44:52.120 --> 1:44:54.400\n Just be like a good person.\n\n1:44:54.400 --> 1:44:56.680\n Because then, I see this actually\n\n1:44:56.680 --> 1:44:58.680\n with social media in general.\n\n1:45:00.120 --> 1:45:03.840\n Just present yourself in the most authentic way possible,\n\n1:45:03.840 --> 1:45:06.880\n meaning be the same person online as you are privately.\n\n1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:08.080\n Have nothing to hide.\n\n1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:11.800\n That's one, not the only, but one of the ways\n\n1:45:11.800 --> 1:45:13.600\n to achieve security.\n\n1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:15.820\n Maybe I'm totally wrong on this,\n\n1:45:15.820 --> 1:45:19.520\n but don't be secretly weird.\n\n1:45:19.520 --> 1:45:21.860\n If you're weird, be publicly weird\n\n1:45:21.860 --> 1:45:24.300\n so it's impossible to blackmail you.\n\n1:45:24.300 --> 1:45:25.440\n That's my approach to security.\n\n1:45:25.440 --> 1:45:26.600\n Yeah, well, they call it\n\n1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:29.920\n the New York Times front page phenomenon.\n\n1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:32.720\n Don't put anything in email or I guess social media\n\n1:45:32.720 --> 1:45:35.800\n these days that you wouldn't want to read\n\n1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:37.920\n on the front page of the New York Times.\n\n1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:41.620\n And that works, but sometimes I even get carried,\n\n1:45:41.620 --> 1:45:45.560\n I mean, I have not as many followers as you,\n\n1:45:45.560 --> 1:45:47.080\n but a lot of followers,\n\n1:45:47.080 --> 1:45:49.080\n and sometimes even I get carried away.\n\n1:45:49.080 --> 1:45:51.280\n Just be emotional and stuff and say something.\n\n1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:56.280\n Yeah, I mean, just the cortisol response on Twitter.\n\n1:45:57.320 --> 1:46:01.600\n Twitter is basically designed to elicit those responses.\n\n1:46:01.600 --> 1:46:04.720\n I mean, every day I turn on my computer,\n\n1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:07.760\n I look at my phone, I look at what's trending on Twitter,\n\n1:46:07.760 --> 1:46:10.080\n and it's like, what are the topics\n\n1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:13.740\n that are gonna make people the most angry today?\n\n1:46:13.740 --> 1:46:14.580\n You know?\n\n1:46:14.580 --> 1:46:19.160\n And you know, it's easy to get carried away,\n\n1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:22.320\n but it's also just, that sucks too,\n\n1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:25.280\n that you have to be constantly censoring yourself.\n\n1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:26.620\n And maybe it's for the better.\n\n1:46:26.620 --> 1:46:29.480\n Maybe you can't be a secret asshole,\n\n1:46:29.480 --> 1:46:31.360\n and we can put that in the good bucket.\n\n1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:33.700\n But at the same time, you know,\n\n1:46:33.700 --> 1:46:38.700\n there is a danger to that other voice,\n\n1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:43.060\n to creativity, you know, to being weird.\n\n1:46:43.060 --> 1:46:45.600\n There's a danger to that little whispered voice\n\n1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:48.840\n that's like, well, how would people read that?\n\n1:46:48.840 --> 1:46:51.160\n You know, how could that be manipulated?\n\n1:46:51.160 --> 1:46:53.520\n How could that be used against you?\n\n1:46:53.520 --> 1:46:58.520\n And that stifles creativity and innovation and free thought.\n\n1:47:00.280 --> 1:47:05.280\n And you know, that is on a very micro level.\n\n1:47:06.840 --> 1:47:08.920\n And that's something I think about a lot.\n\n1:47:08.920 --> 1:47:11.600\n And that's actually something that Tim Cook\n\n1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:13.200\n has talked about a lot,\n\n1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:17.640\n and why he has said he goes full force on privacy\n\n1:47:17.640 --> 1:47:20.960\n is it's just that little voice\n\n1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:24.840\n that is at some level censoring you.\n\n1:47:24.840 --> 1:47:28.280\n And what is sort of the long term impact\n\n1:47:28.280 --> 1:47:31.000\n of that little voice over time?\n\n1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:35.200\n I think there's a ways, I think that self censorship\n\n1:47:35.200 --> 1:47:37.680\n is an attack factor that there's solutions to.\n\n1:47:37.680 --> 1:47:40.160\n The way I'm really inspired by Elon Musk,\n\n1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:43.720\n the solution to that is just be privately\n\n1:47:43.720 --> 1:47:46.800\n and publicly the same person and be ridiculous.\n\n1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:49.760\n Embrace the full weirdness and show it more and more.\n\n1:47:49.760 --> 1:47:54.080\n So, you know, that's memes that has like ridiculous humor.\n\n1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:57.860\n And I think, and if there is something\n\n1:47:57.860 --> 1:48:00.940\n you really wanna hide, deeply consider\n\n1:48:00.940 --> 1:48:02.520\n if that you wanna be that.\n\n1:48:03.560 --> 1:48:05.280\n Like, why are you hiding it?\n\n1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:07.400\n What exactly are you afraid of?\n\n1:48:07.400 --> 1:48:10.640\n Because I think my hopeful vision for the internet\n\n1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:13.320\n is the internet loves authenticity.\n\n1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:18.260\n They wanna see you weird, so be that and like live that fully\n\n1:48:18.260 --> 1:48:20.240\n because I think that gray area\n\n1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:22.400\n where you're kind of censoring yourself,\n\n1:48:22.400 --> 1:48:25.120\n that's where the destruction is.\n\n1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:28.760\n You have to go all the way, step over, be weird.\n\n1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:31.040\n And then it feels, it can be painful\n\n1:48:31.040 --> 1:48:33.680\n because people can attack you and so on, but just ride it.\n\n1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:35.960\n I mean, that's just like a skill\n\n1:48:35.960 --> 1:48:38.080\n on the social psychological level\n\n1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:42.080\n that ends up being an approach to security,\n\n1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:45.080\n which is like remove the attack vector\n\n1:48:45.080 --> 1:48:46.960\n of having private information\n\n1:48:46.960 --> 1:48:50.080\n by being your full weird self publicly.\n\n1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:55.840\n What advice would you give to young folks today,\n\n1:48:55.840 --> 1:49:00.680\n you know, operating in this complicated space\n\n1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:02.520\n about how to have a successful life,\n\n1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:03.960\n a life they can be proud of,\n\n1:49:03.960 --> 1:49:05.580\n a career they can be proud of?\n\n1:49:07.640 --> 1:49:09.480\n Maybe somebody in high school and college\n\n1:49:09.480 --> 1:49:11.600\n thinking about what they're going to do.\n\n1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:15.120\n Be a hacker, you know, if you have any interest,\n\n1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:19.960\n become a hacker and apply yourself to defense, you know.\n\n1:49:19.960 --> 1:49:21.800\n Every time, like we do have\n\n1:49:21.800 --> 1:49:24.620\n these amazing scholarship programs, for instance,\n\n1:49:24.620 --> 1:49:26.640\n where, you know, they find you early,\n\n1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:30.040\n they'll pay your college as long as you commit\n\n1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:32.000\n to some kind of federal commitment\n\n1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:35.320\n to sort of help federal agencies with cybersecurity.\n\n1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:37.880\n And where does everyone wanna go every year\n\n1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:39.100\n from the scholarship program?\n\n1:49:39.100 --> 1:49:42.240\n They wanna go work at the NSA or Cyber Command, you know.\n\n1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:44.240\n They wanna go work on offense.\n\n1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:46.240\n They wanna go do the sexy stuff.\n\n1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:49.940\n It's really hard to get people to work on defense.\n\n1:49:49.940 --> 1:49:51.800\n It's just, it's always been more fun\n\n1:49:51.800 --> 1:49:54.560\n to be a pirate than be in the Coast Guard, you know.\n\n1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:59.160\n And so we have a huge deficit\n\n1:49:59.160 --> 1:50:01.320\n when it comes to filling those roles.\n\n1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:06.320\n There's 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity positions\n\n1:50:06.600 --> 1:50:08.000\n around the world.\n\n1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:09.680\n I mean, talk about job security,\n\n1:50:09.680 --> 1:50:12.760\n like be a hacker and work on cybersecurity.\n\n1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:14.300\n You will always have a job.\n\n1:50:15.300 --> 1:50:18.600\n And we're actually at a huge deficit\n\n1:50:18.600 --> 1:50:21.320\n and disadvantage as a free market economy\n\n1:50:22.200 --> 1:50:26.800\n because we can't match cybersecurity salaries\n\n1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:30.060\n at Palantir or Facebook or Google or Microsoft.\n\n1:50:30.060 --> 1:50:32.480\n And so it's really hard for the United States\n\n1:50:32.480 --> 1:50:33.840\n to fill those roles.\n\n1:50:33.840 --> 1:50:38.400\n And, you know, other countries have had this work around\n\n1:50:38.400 --> 1:50:41.460\n where they basically have forced conscription on some level.\n\n1:50:41.460 --> 1:50:43.720\n You know, China tells people,\n\n1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:46.840\n like you do whatever you're gonna do during the day,\n\n1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:48.520\n work at Alibaba.\n\n1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:51.340\n You know, if you need to do some ransomware, okay.\n\n1:50:51.340 --> 1:50:53.960\n But the minute we tap you on the shoulder\n\n1:50:53.960 --> 1:50:57.160\n and ask you to come do this sensitive operation for us,\n\n1:50:57.160 --> 1:50:59.180\n the answer is yes.\n\n1:50:59.180 --> 1:51:00.820\n You know, same with Russia.\n\n1:51:00.820 --> 1:51:03.640\n You know, a couple of years ago when Yahoo was hacked\n\n1:51:03.640 --> 1:51:05.680\n and they laid it all out in an indictment,\n\n1:51:05.680 --> 1:51:07.680\n it came down to two cyber criminals\n\n1:51:07.680 --> 1:51:09.560\n and two guys from the FSB.\n\n1:51:09.560 --> 1:51:12.160\n Cyber criminals were allowed to have their fun,\n\n1:51:12.160 --> 1:51:14.860\n but the minute they came across the username and password\n\n1:51:14.860 --> 1:51:16.740\n for someone's personal Yahoo account\n\n1:51:16.740 --> 1:51:19.440\n that worked at the White House or the State Department\n\n1:51:19.440 --> 1:51:23.640\n or military, they were expected to pass that over to the FSB.\n\n1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:24.960\n So we don't do that here.\n\n1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:27.400\n And it's even worse on defense.\n\n1:51:27.400 --> 1:51:29.880\n We really can't fill these positions.\n\n1:51:29.880 --> 1:51:33.040\n So, you know, if you are a hacker,\n\n1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:34.800\n if you're interested in code,\n\n1:51:34.800 --> 1:51:38.480\n if you're a tinker, you know, learn how to hack.\n\n1:51:39.920 --> 1:51:42.720\n There are all sorts of amazing hacking competitions\n\n1:51:42.720 --> 1:51:47.520\n you can do through the SANS org, for example, S A N S.\n\n1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:50.880\n And then use those skills for good.\n\n1:51:50.880 --> 1:51:53.500\n You know, neuter the bugs in that code\n\n1:51:53.500 --> 1:51:56.300\n that get used by autocratic regimes\n\n1:51:56.300 --> 1:51:59.300\n to make people's life, you know, a living prison.\n\n1:52:00.140 --> 1:52:01.680\n You know, plug those holes.\n\n1:52:01.680 --> 1:52:03.720\n You know, defend industrial systems,\n\n1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:06.000\n defend our water treatment facilities\n\n1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:07.820\n from hacks where people are trying to come in\n\n1:52:07.820 --> 1:52:09.500\n and poison the water.\n\n1:52:09.500 --> 1:52:12.660\n You know, that I think is just an amazing,\n\n1:52:14.160 --> 1:52:16.280\n it's an amazing job on so many levels.\n\n1:52:16.280 --> 1:52:19.680\n It's intellectually stimulating.\n\n1:52:19.680 --> 1:52:22.920\n You can tell yourself you're serving your country.\n\n1:52:22.920 --> 1:52:24.680\n You can tell yourself you're saving lives\n\n1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:26.160\n and keeping people safe.\n\n1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:28.480\n And you'll always have amazing job security.\n\n1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:31.000\n And if you need to go get that job that pays you,\n\n1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:33.560\n you know, 2 million bucks a year, you can do that too.\n\n1:52:33.560 --> 1:52:34.880\n And you can have a public profile,\n\n1:52:34.880 --> 1:52:38.800\n more so of a public profile, you can be a public rockstar.\n\n1:52:38.800 --> 1:52:42.720\n I mean, it's the same thing as sort of the military.\n\n1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:44.020\n There's a lot of,\n\n1:52:46.520 --> 1:52:49.980\n there's a lot of well known sort of people\n\n1:52:49.980 --> 1:52:51.700\n commenting on the fact that veterans\n\n1:52:51.700 --> 1:52:54.040\n are not treated as well as they should be.\n\n1:52:54.040 --> 1:52:56.120\n But it's still the fact that soldiers\n\n1:52:56.120 --> 1:53:00.380\n are deeply respected for defending the country,\n\n1:53:00.380 --> 1:53:02.840\n the freedoms, the ideals that we stand for.\n\n1:53:02.840 --> 1:53:05.480\n And in the same way, I mean, in some ways,\n\n1:53:05.480 --> 1:53:09.040\n the cybersecurity defense are the soldiers of the future.\n\n1:53:09.040 --> 1:53:10.760\n Yeah, and you know what's interesting,\n\n1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:14.160\n I mean, in cybersecurity, the difference is,\n\n1:53:14.160 --> 1:53:17.200\n oftentimes you see the more interesting threats\n\n1:53:17.200 --> 1:53:20.380\n in the private sector, because that's where the attacks come.\n\n1:53:20.380 --> 1:53:22.520\n You know, when cyber criminals\n\n1:53:22.520 --> 1:53:25.600\n and nation state adversaries come for the United States,\n\n1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:29.080\n they don't go directly for Cyber Command or the NSA.\n\n1:53:29.080 --> 1:53:32.960\n You know, they go for banks, they go for Google,\n\n1:53:32.960 --> 1:53:36.680\n they go for Microsoft, they go for critical infrastructure.\n\n1:53:36.680 --> 1:53:39.600\n And so those companies, those private sector companies\n\n1:53:39.600 --> 1:53:41.840\n get to see some of the most advanced,\n\n1:53:41.840 --> 1:53:45.720\n sophisticated attacks out there.\n\n1:53:45.720 --> 1:53:48.600\n And you know, if you're working at FireEye\n\n1:53:48.600 --> 1:53:51.580\n and you're calling out the SolarWinds attack, for instance,\n\n1:53:51.580 --> 1:53:56.120\n I mean, you just saved God knows how many systems\n\n1:53:56.120 --> 1:53:59.960\n from, you know, that compromise turning into something\n\n1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:02.520\n that more closely resembles sabotage.\n\n1:54:03.680 --> 1:54:08.680\n So, you know, go be a hacker, or go be a journalist.\n\n1:54:08.960 --> 1:54:13.020\n So you wrote the book,\n\n1:54:13.020 --> 1:54:15.840\n This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends,\n\n1:54:15.840 --> 1:54:17.520\n as we've been talking about,\n\n1:54:17.520 --> 1:54:20.240\n of course, referring to cyber war, cybersecurity.\n\n1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:25.320\n What gives you hope about the future of our world\n\n1:54:25.320 --> 1:54:26.640\n if it doesn't end?\n\n1:54:26.640 --> 1:54:28.020\n How will it not end?\n\n1:54:31.520 --> 1:54:32.800\n That's a good question.\n\n1:54:32.800 --> 1:54:34.560\n I mean, I have to have hope, right?\n\n1:54:34.560 --> 1:54:37.360\n Because I have a kid and I have another on the way,\n\n1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:41.000\n and if I didn't have hope, I wouldn't be having kids.\n\n1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:45.440\n But it's a scary time to be having kids.\n\n1:54:46.520 --> 1:54:50.600\n And you know, it's like pandemic, climate change,\n\n1:54:50.600 --> 1:54:55.600\n disinformation, increasingly advanced, perhaps deadly\n\n1:54:55.640 --> 1:54:56.820\n cyber attacks.\n\n1:54:57.740 --> 1:55:01.480\n What gives me hope is that I share your worldview\n\n1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:04.060\n that I think people are fundamentally good.\n\n1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:07.600\n And sometimes, and this is why the metaverse\n\n1:55:07.600 --> 1:55:10.780\n scares me to death, but when I'm reminded of that\n\n1:55:10.780 --> 1:55:12.160\n is not online.\n\n1:55:13.080 --> 1:55:15.160\n Like online, I get the opposite.\n\n1:55:15.160 --> 1:55:17.380\n You know, you start to lose hope and humanity\n\n1:55:17.380 --> 1:55:19.300\n when you're on Twitter half your day.\n\n1:55:19.300 --> 1:55:22.600\n It's like when I go to the grocery store\n\n1:55:22.600 --> 1:55:26.320\n or I go on a hike or like someone smiles at me\n\n1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:30.100\n or you know, or someone just says something nice.\n\n1:55:31.160 --> 1:55:33.280\n You know, people are fundamentally good.\n\n1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:37.080\n We just don't hear from those people enough.\n\n1:55:37.080 --> 1:55:42.080\n And my hope is, I just think our current political climate,\n\n1:55:42.880 --> 1:55:44.880\n like we've hit rock bottom.\n\n1:55:44.880 --> 1:55:46.640\n This is as bad as it gets.\n\n1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:47.840\n We can't do anything.\n\n1:55:47.840 --> 1:55:49.760\n Don't jinx it.\n\n1:55:49.760 --> 1:55:51.960\n But I think it's a generational thing.\n\n1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:56.040\n You know, I think baby boomers, like it's time to move along.\n\n1:55:57.120 --> 1:56:01.100\n I think it's time for a new generation to come in.\n\n1:56:01.100 --> 1:56:06.000\n And I actually have a lot of hope when I look at you.\n\n1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.800\n I'm sort of like this, I guess they call me\n\n1:56:08.800 --> 1:56:12.080\n a geriatric millennial or a young gen X.\n\n1:56:12.080 --> 1:56:14.460\n But like we have this unique responsibility\n\n1:56:14.460 --> 1:56:17.560\n because I grew up without the internet\n\n1:56:17.560 --> 1:56:20.960\n and without social media, but I'm native to it.\n\n1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:25.280\n So I know the good and I know the bad.\n\n1:56:25.280 --> 1:56:28.240\n And that's true on so many different things.\n\n1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:32.060\n You know, I grew up without climate change anxiety\n\n1:56:32.060 --> 1:56:34.860\n and now I'm feeling it and I know it's not a given.\n\n1:56:34.860 --> 1:56:38.920\n We don't have to just resign ourselves to climate change.\n\n1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:41.200\n You know, same with disinformation.\n\n1:56:41.200 --> 1:56:44.080\n And I think a lot of the problems we face today\n\n1:56:44.080 --> 1:56:47.640\n have just exposed the sort of inertia\n\n1:56:47.640 --> 1:56:49.960\n that there has been on so many of these issues.\n\n1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:52.880\n And I really think it's a generational shift\n\n1:56:52.880 --> 1:56:54.500\n that has to happen.\n\n1:56:54.500 --> 1:56:57.620\n And I think this next generation is gonna come in\n\n1:56:57.620 --> 1:56:59.520\n and say like, we're not doing business\n\n1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:00.960\n like you guys did it anymore.\n\n1:57:00.960 --> 1:57:02.480\n You know, we're not just gonna like rape\n\n1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:05.280\n and pillage the earth and try and turn everyone\n\n1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:07.800\n against each other and play dirty tricks\n\n1:57:07.800 --> 1:57:11.440\n and let lobbyists dictate what we do\n\n1:57:11.440 --> 1:57:14.040\n or don't do as a country anymore.\n\n1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:16.480\n And that's really where I see the hope.\n\n1:57:16.480 --> 1:57:19.160\n It feels like there's a lot of low hanging fruit\n\n1:57:19.160 --> 1:57:23.760\n for young minds to step up and create solutions and lead.\n\n1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:28.760\n So whenever like politicians or leaders that are older,\n\n1:57:30.600 --> 1:57:34.120\n like you said, are acting shitty, I see that as a positive.\n\n1:57:34.120 --> 1:57:38.100\n They're inspiring a large number of young people\n\n1:57:38.100 --> 1:57:39.640\n to replace them.\n\n1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:42.560\n And so I think you're right, there's going to be,\n\n1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:45.160\n it's almost like you need people to act shitty\n\n1:57:45.160 --> 1:57:47.860\n to remind them, oh, wow, we need good leaders.\n\n1:57:47.860 --> 1:57:51.360\n We need great creators and builders and entrepreneurs\n\n1:57:51.360 --> 1:57:54.120\n and scientists and engineers and journalists.\n\n1:57:54.120 --> 1:57:56.560\n You know, all the discussions about how the journalism\n\n1:57:56.560 --> 1:57:58.640\n is quote unquote broken and so on,\n\n1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:02.080\n that's just an inspiration for new institutions to rise up\n\n1:58:02.080 --> 1:58:03.760\n that do journalism better,\n\n1:58:03.760 --> 1:58:06.320\n new journalists to step up and do journalism better.\n\n1:58:06.320 --> 1:58:08.640\n So I, and I've been constantly,\n\n1:58:08.640 --> 1:58:11.760\n when I talk to young people, I'm constantly impressed\n\n1:58:11.760 --> 1:58:16.440\n by the ones that dream to build solutions.\n\n1:58:16.440 --> 1:58:21.320\n And so that's ultimately why I put the hope.\n\n1:58:21.320 --> 1:58:23.160\n But the world is a messy place,\n\n1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:26.220\n like we've been talking about, it's a scary place.\n\n1:58:27.760 --> 1:58:29.720\n Yeah, and I think you hit something,\n\n1:58:29.720 --> 1:58:33.120\n hit on something earlier, which is authenticity.\n\n1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:38.120\n Like no one is going to rise above that is plastic anymore.\n\n1:58:40.080 --> 1:58:43.120\n You know, people are craving authenticity.\n\n1:58:43.120 --> 1:58:46.540\n You know, the benefit of the internet is it's really hard\n\n1:58:46.540 --> 1:58:49.980\n to hide who you are on every single platform.\n\n1:58:49.980 --> 1:58:51.840\n You know, on some level it's gonna come out\n\n1:58:51.840 --> 1:58:53.480\n who you really are.\n\n1:58:53.480 --> 1:58:57.420\n And so you hope that, you know,\n\n1:58:57.420 --> 1:58:59.280\n by the time my kids are grown,\n\n1:58:59.280 --> 1:59:04.120\n like no one's gonna care if they made one mistake online,\n\n1:59:04.120 --> 1:59:07.040\n so long as they're authentic, you know?\n\n1:59:07.040 --> 1:59:09.600\n And I used to worry about this.\n\n1:59:09.600 --> 1:59:13.280\n My nephew was born the day I graduated from college.\n\n1:59:13.280 --> 1:59:17.760\n And I just always, you know, he's like born into Facebook.\n\n1:59:17.760 --> 1:59:21.000\n And I just think like, how is a kid like that\n\n1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:24.040\n ever gonna be president of the United States of America?\n\n1:59:24.040 --> 1:59:27.740\n Because if Facebook had been around when I was in college,\n\n1:59:27.740 --> 1:59:31.480\n you know, like Jesus, you know,\n\n1:59:31.480 --> 1:59:34.240\n how are those kids are gonna ever be president?\n\n1:59:34.240 --> 1:59:37.480\n There's gonna be some photo of them at some point\n\n1:59:37.480 --> 1:59:41.760\n making some mistake, and that's gonna be all over for them.\n\n1:59:41.760 --> 1:59:43.100\n And now I take that back.\n\n1:59:43.100 --> 1:59:46.700\n Now it's like, no, everyone's gonna make mistakes.\n\n1:59:46.700 --> 1:59:49.400\n There's gonna be a picture for everyone.\n\n1:59:49.400 --> 1:59:53.020\n And we're all gonna have to come and grow up\n\n1:59:53.020 --> 1:59:56.480\n to the view that as humans, we're gonna make huge mistakes.\n\n1:59:56.480 --> 1:59:58.120\n And hopefully they're not so big\n\n1:59:58.120 --> 2:00:00.680\n that they're gonna ruin the rest of your life.\n\n2:00:00.680 --> 2:00:02.980\n But we're gonna have to come around to this view\n\n2:00:02.980 --> 2:00:04.520\n that we're all human.\n\n2:00:04.520 --> 2:00:07.280\n And we're gonna have to be a little bit more forgiving\n\n2:00:07.280 --> 2:00:10.160\n and a little bit more tolerant when people mess up.\n\n2:00:10.160 --> 2:00:12.080\n And we're gonna have to be a little bit more humble\n\n2:00:12.080 --> 2:00:15.600\n when we do, and like keep moving forward.\n\n2:00:15.600 --> 2:00:18.640\n Otherwise you can't like cancel everyone, you know?\n\n2:00:18.640 --> 2:00:21.680\n Nicole, this is an incredible, hopeful conversation.\n\n2:00:21.680 --> 2:00:26.680\n Also, one that reveals that in the shadows\n\n2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.200\n there's a lot of challenges to be solved.\n\n2:00:30.200 --> 2:00:32.320\n So I really appreciate that you took on\n\n2:00:32.320 --> 2:00:34.280\n this really difficult subject with your book.\n\n2:00:34.280 --> 2:00:35.840\n That's journalism at its best.\n\n2:00:35.840 --> 2:00:38.680\n So I'm really grateful that you took the risk\n\n2:00:38.680 --> 2:00:40.200\n that you took that on,\n\n2:00:40.200 --> 2:00:42.600\n and that you plugged the cable box back in.\n\n2:00:42.600 --> 2:00:43.800\n That means you have hope.\n\n2:00:43.800 --> 2:00:46.560\n And thank you so much for spending\n\n2:00:46.560 --> 2:00:47.920\n your valuable time with me today.\n\n2:00:47.920 --> 2:00:49.880\n Thank you, thanks for having me.\n\n2:00:49.880 --> 2:00:52.240\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:00:52.240 --> 2:00:53.680\n with Nicole Perlroth.\n\n2:00:53.680 --> 2:00:54.920\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:00:54.920 --> 2:00:57.720\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:00:57.720 --> 2:01:00.080\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:01.800\n from Nicole herself.\n\n2:01:01.800 --> 2:01:05.640\n Here we are, entrusting our entire digital lives,\n\n2:01:05.640 --> 2:01:09.040\n passwords, texts, love letters, banking records,\n\n2:01:09.040 --> 2:01:10.860\n health records, credit cards, sources,\n\n2:01:10.860 --> 2:01:14.040\n and deepest thoughts to this mystery box\n\n2:01:14.040 --> 2:01:17.780\n whose inner circuitry most of us would never vet.\n\n2:01:17.780 --> 2:01:20.740\n Run by code written in a language most of us\n\n2:01:20.740 --> 2:01:22.400\n will never fully understand.\n\n2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:47.400\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
