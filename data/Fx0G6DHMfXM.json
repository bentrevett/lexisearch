00:08.080\n writer, futurist, musician,\n\n00:08.080 --> 00:11.680\n and the founder of the field of virtual reality.\n\n00:11.680 --> 00:12.800\n To support this podcast,\n\n00:12.800 --> 00:15.880\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n00:15.880 --> 00:16.840\n As a side note,\n\n00:16.840 --> 00:19.040\n you may know that Jaron is a staunch critic\n\n00:19.040 --> 00:20.720\n of social media platforms.\n\n00:20.720 --> 00:23.780\n Him and I agree on many aspects of this,\n\n00:23.780 --> 00:26.340\n except perhaps I am more optimistic\n\n00:26.340 --> 00:29.700\n about it being possible to build better platforms.\n\n00:29.700 --> 00:32.200\n And better artificial intelligence systems\n\n00:32.200 --> 00:33.900\n that put longterm interests\n\n00:33.900 --> 00:36.660\n and happiness of human beings first.\n\n00:36.660 --> 00:40.240\n Let me also say a general comment about these conversations.\n\n00:40.240 --> 00:42.520\n I try to make sure I prepare well,\n\n00:42.520 --> 00:44.400\n remove my ego from the picture,\n\n00:44.400 --> 00:47.200\n and focus on making the other person shine\n\n00:47.200 --> 00:49.140\n as we try to explore the most beautiful\n\n00:49.140 --> 00:51.800\n and insightful ideas in their mind.\n\n00:51.800 --> 00:53.320\n This can be challenging\n\n00:53.320 --> 00:55.280\n when the ideas that are close to my heart\n\n00:55.280 --> 00:57.180\n are being criticized.\n\n00:57.180 --> 00:59.940\n In those cases, I do offer a little pushback,\n\n00:59.940 --> 01:02.680\n but respectfully, and then move on,\n\n01:02.680 --> 01:04.280\n trying to have the other person come out\n\n01:04.280 --> 01:06.620\n looking wiser in the exchange.\n\n01:06.620 --> 01:09.960\n I think there's no such thing as winning in conversations,\n\n01:09.960 --> 01:11.560\n nor in life.\n\n01:11.560 --> 01:14.000\n My goal is to learn and to have fun.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:15.840\n I ask that you don't see my approach\n\n01:15.840 --> 01:17.980\n to these conversations as weakness.\n\n01:17.980 --> 01:19.200\n It is not.\n\n01:19.200 --> 01:21.520\n It is my attempt at showing respect\n\n01:21.520 --> 01:24.120\n and love for the other person.\n\n01:24.120 --> 01:28.520\n That said, I also often just do a bad job of talking,\n\n01:28.520 --> 01:30.820\n but you probably already knew that.\n\n01:30.820 --> 01:33.440\n So please give me a pass on that as well.\n\n01:33.440 --> 01:35.560\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,\n\n01:35.560 --> 01:38.640\n and here is my conversation with Jaron Lanier.\n\n01:39.520 --> 01:43.160\n You're considered the founding father of virtual reality.\n\n01:44.600 --> 01:47.320\n Do you think we will one day spend most\n\n01:47.320 --> 01:51.540\n or all of our lives in virtual reality worlds?\n\n01:51.540 --> 01:56.420\n I have always found the very most valuable moment\n\n01:56.420 --> 01:58.360\n in virtual reality to be the moment\n\n01:58.360 --> 02:01.260\n when you take off the headset and your senses are refreshed\n\n02:01.260 --> 02:05.180\n and you perceive physicality afresh,\n\n02:05.180 --> 02:07.020\n as if you were a newborn baby,\n\n02:07.020 --> 02:09.020\n but with a little more experience.\n\n02:09.020 --> 02:13.740\n So you can really notice just how incredibly strange\n\n02:13.740 --> 02:18.740\n and delicate and peculiar and impossible the real world is.\n\n02:18.740 --> 02:22.220\n So the magic is, and perhaps forever will be\n\n02:22.220 --> 02:23.540\n in the physical world.\n\n02:23.540 --> 02:25.100\n Well, that's my take on it.\n\n02:25.100 --> 02:25.940\n That's just me.\n\n02:25.940 --> 02:29.380\n I mean, I think I don't get to tell everybody else\n\n02:29.380 --> 02:31.980\n how to think or how to experience virtual reality.\n\n02:31.980 --> 02:35.020\n And at this point, there have been multiple generations\n\n02:35.020 --> 02:39.460\n of younger people who've come along and liberated me\n\n02:39.460 --> 02:41.620\n from having to worry about these things.\n\n02:42.620 --> 02:45.780\n But I should say also even in what some,\n\n02:45.780 --> 02:47.340\n well, I called it mixed reality,\n\n02:47.340 --> 02:49.220\n back in the day, and these days it's called\n\n02:49.220 --> 02:53.180\n augmented reality, but with something like a HoloLens,\n\n02:53.180 --> 02:56.060\n even then, like one of my favorite things\n\n02:56.060 --> 02:58.900\n is to augment a forest, not because I think the forest\n\n02:58.900 --> 03:02.340\n needs augmentation, but when you look at the augmentation\n\n03:02.340 --> 03:05.460\n next to a real tree, the real tree just pops out\n\n03:05.460 --> 03:09.940\n as being astounding, it's interactive,\n\n03:09.940 --> 03:12.780\n it's changing slightly all the time if you pay attention,\n\n03:12.780 --> 03:14.580\n and it's hard to pay attention to that,\n\n03:14.580 --> 03:16.340\n but when you compare it to virtual reality,\n\n03:16.340 --> 03:18.140\n all of a sudden you do.\n\n03:18.140 --> 03:20.580\n And even in practical applications,\n\n03:20.580 --> 03:24.380\n my favorite early application of virtual reality,\n\n03:24.380 --> 03:27.020\n which we prototyped going back to the 80s\n\n03:27.020 --> 03:30.460\n when I was working with Dr. Joe Rosen at Stanford Med\n\n03:30.460 --> 03:34.500\n near where we are now, we made the first surgical simulator.\n\n03:34.500 --> 03:39.500\n And to go from the fake anatomy of the simulation,\n\n03:39.820 --> 03:42.220\n which is incredibly valuable for many things,\n\n03:42.220 --> 03:43.820\n for designing procedures, for training,\n\n03:43.820 --> 03:45.580\n for all kinds of things, then to go to the real world\n\n03:45.580 --> 03:47.700\n is then to go to the real person,\n\n03:47.700 --> 03:51.260\n boy, it's really something like surgeons\n\n03:51.260 --> 03:54.060\n really get woken up by that transition, it's very cool.\n\n03:54.060 --> 03:56.220\n So I think the transition is actually more valuable\n\n03:56.220 --> 03:57.520\n than the simulation.\n\n03:58.500 --> 04:01.700\n That's fascinating, I never really thought about that.\n\n04:01.700 --> 04:05.620\n It's almost, it's like traveling elsewhere\n\n04:05.620 --> 04:08.260\n in the physical space can help you appreciate\n\n04:08.260 --> 04:11.940\n how much you value your home once you return.\n\n04:11.940 --> 04:13.620\n Well, that's how I take it.\n\n04:13.620 --> 04:16.540\n I mean, once again, people have different attitudes\n\n04:16.540 --> 04:18.740\n towards it, all are welcome.\n\n04:18.740 --> 04:20.380\n What do you think is the difference\n\n04:20.380 --> 04:23.820\n between the virtual world and the physical meat space world\n\n04:23.820 --> 04:26.780\n that you are still drawn, for you personally,\n\n04:26.780 --> 04:28.940\n still drawn to the physical world?\n\n04:28.940 --> 04:31.620\n Like there clearly then is a distinction.\n\n04:31.620 --> 04:33.260\n Is there some fundamental distinction\n\n04:33.260 --> 04:37.580\n or is it the peculiarities of the current set of technology?\n\n04:37.580 --> 04:41.480\n In terms of the kind of virtual reality that we have now,\n\n04:41.480 --> 04:46.000\n it's made of software and software is terrible stuff.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:50.360\n Software is always the slave of its own history,\n\n04:50.360 --> 04:52.040\n its own legacy.\n\n04:52.040 --> 04:57.040\n It's always infinitely arbitrarily messy and arbitrary.\n\n04:57.560 --> 05:00.260\n Working with it brings out a certain kind\n\n05:00.260 --> 05:03.480\n of nerdy personality in people, or at least in me,\n\n05:03.480 --> 05:05.920\n which I'm not that fond of.\n\n05:05.920 --> 05:07.760\n And there are all kinds of things about software\n\n05:07.760 --> 05:09.160\n I don't like.\n\n05:09.160 --> 05:11.600\n And so that's different from the physical world.\n\n05:11.600 --> 05:15.000\n It's not something we understand, as you just pointed out.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.340\n On the other hand, I'm a little mystified\n\n05:17.340 --> 05:18.680\n when people ask me, well,\n\n05:18.680 --> 05:21.540\n do you think the universe is a computer?\n\n05:21.540 --> 05:23.520\n And I have to say, well, I mean,\n\n05:24.520 --> 05:26.260\n what on earth could you possibly mean\n\n05:26.260 --> 05:27.960\n if you say it isn't a computer?\n\n05:27.960 --> 05:30.080\n If it isn't a computer,\n\n05:30.080 --> 05:33.960\n it wouldn't follow principles consistently\n\n05:33.960 --> 05:35.680\n and it wouldn't be intelligible\n\n05:35.680 --> 05:38.520\n because what else is a computer ultimately?\n\n05:38.520 --> 05:41.260\n I mean, and we have physics, we have technology,\n\n05:41.260 --> 05:43.720\n so we can do technology so we can program it.\n\n05:43.720 --> 05:45.720\n So, I mean, of course it's some kind of computer,\n\n05:45.720 --> 05:49.000\n but I think trying to understand it as a Turing machine\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:52.840\n is probably a foolish approach.\n\n05:52.840 --> 05:56.840\n Right, that's the question, whether it performs,\n\n05:56.840 --> 05:58.840\n this computer we call the universe,\n\n05:58.840 --> 06:01.160\n performs the kind of computation that can be modeled\n\n06:01.160 --> 06:03.960\n as a universal Turing machine,\n\n06:03.960 --> 06:07.280\n or is it something much more fancy,\n\n06:07.280 --> 06:09.440\n so fancy, in fact, that it may be\n\n06:09.440 --> 06:12.640\n beyond our cognitive capabilities to understand?\n\n06:12.640 --> 06:14.660\n Turing machines are kind of,\n\n06:16.380 --> 06:18.680\n I call them teases in a way,\n\n06:18.680 --> 06:23.160\n because if you have an infinitely smart programmer\n\n06:23.160 --> 06:24.660\n with an infinite amount of time,\n\n06:24.660 --> 06:25.900\n an infinite amount of memory,\n\n06:25.900 --> 06:29.900\n and an infinite clock speed, then they're universal,\n\n06:29.900 --> 06:31.400\n but that cannot exist.\n\n06:31.400 --> 06:33.120\n So they're not universal in practice.\n\n06:33.120 --> 06:36.260\n And they actually are, in practice,\n\n06:36.260 --> 06:40.640\n a very particular sort of machine within the constraints,\n\n06:40.640 --> 06:44.020\n within the conservation principles of any reality\n\n06:44.020 --> 06:46.440\n that's worth being in, probably.\n\n06:46.440 --> 06:51.440\n And so I think universality of a particular model\n\n06:55.640 --> 06:58.560\n is probably a deceptive way to think,\n\n06:58.560 --> 07:00.760\n even though at some sort of limit,\n\n07:00.760 --> 07:05.080\n of course something like that's gotta be true\n\n07:05.080 --> 07:07.400\n at some sort of high enough limit,\n\n07:07.400 --> 07:10.440\n but it's just not accessible to us, so what's the point?\n\n07:10.440 --> 07:12.960\n Well, to me, the question of whether we're living\n\n07:12.960 --> 07:15.480\n inside a computer or a simulation\n\n07:15.480 --> 07:17.280\n is interesting in the following way.\n\n07:18.520 --> 07:20.920\n There's a technical question that's here.\n\n07:20.920 --> 07:25.840\n How difficult is it to build a machine,\n\n07:25.840 --> 07:28.360\n not that simulates the universe,\n\n07:28.360 --> 07:31.480\n but that makes it sufficiently realistic\n\n07:31.480 --> 07:33.440\n that we wouldn't know the difference,\n\n07:33.440 --> 07:36.240\n or better yet, sufficiently realistic\n\n07:36.240 --> 07:37.860\n that we would kinda know the difference,\n\n07:37.860 --> 07:41.000\n but we would prefer to stay in the virtual world anyway?\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:42.440\n I wanna give you a few different answers.\n\n07:42.440 --> 07:43.960\n I wanna give you the one that I think\n\n07:43.960 --> 07:45.860\n has the most practical importance\n\n07:45.860 --> 07:47.480\n to human beings right now,\n\n07:47.480 --> 07:51.560\n which is that there's a kind of an assertion\n\n07:51.560 --> 07:54.240\n sort of built into the way the questions usually asked\n\n07:54.240 --> 07:57.300\n that I think is false, which is a suggestion\n\n07:57.300 --> 08:00.220\n that people have a fixed level of ability\n\n08:00.220 --> 08:03.120\n to perceive reality in a given way.\n\n08:03.120 --> 08:07.560\n And actually, people are always learning,\n\n08:07.560 --> 08:09.160\n evolving, forming themselves.\n\n08:09.160 --> 08:10.440\n We're fluid, too.\n\n08:10.440 --> 08:13.760\n We're also programmable, self programmable,\n\n08:13.760 --> 08:15.360\n changing, adapting.\n\n08:15.360 --> 08:18.800\n And so my favorite way to get at this\n\n08:18.800 --> 08:21.040\n is to talk about the history of other media.\n\n08:21.040 --> 08:23.640\n So for instance, there was a peer review paper\n\n08:23.640 --> 08:26.480\n that showed that an early wire recorder\n\n08:26.480 --> 08:28.640\n playing back an opera singer behind a curtain\n\n08:28.640 --> 08:31.340\n was indistinguishable from a real opera singer.\n\n08:31.340 --> 08:32.440\n And so now, of course, to us,\n\n08:32.440 --> 08:34.220\n it would not only be distinguishable,\n\n08:34.220 --> 08:35.560\n but it would be very blatant\n\n08:35.560 --> 08:37.680\n because the recording would be horrible.\n\n08:37.680 --> 08:39.240\n But to the people at the time,\n\n08:39.240 --> 08:43.800\n without the experience of it, it seemed plausible.\n\n08:43.800 --> 08:46.360\n There was an early demonstration\n\n08:46.360 --> 08:49.640\n of extremely crude video teleconferencing\n\n08:49.640 --> 08:54.360\n between New York and DC in the 30s, I think so,\n\n08:54.360 --> 08:56.480\n that people viewed as being absolutely realistic\n\n08:56.480 --> 08:59.880\n and indistinguishable, which to us would be horrible.\n\n08:59.880 --> 09:01.000\n And there are many other examples.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:02.280\n Another one, one of my favorite ones,\n\n09:02.280 --> 09:04.200\n is in the Civil War era,\n\n09:04.200 --> 09:06.160\n there were itinerant photographers\n\n09:06.160 --> 09:07.820\n who collected photographs of people\n\n09:07.820 --> 09:10.720\n who just looked kind of like a few archetypes.\n\n09:10.720 --> 09:12.480\n So you could buy a photo of somebody\n\n09:12.480 --> 09:14.320\n who looked kind of like your loved one\n\n09:14.320 --> 09:17.120\n to remind you of that person\n\n09:17.120 --> 09:20.560\n because actually photographing them was inconceivable\n\n09:20.560 --> 09:22.400\n and hiring a painter was too expensive\n\n09:22.400 --> 09:23.960\n and you didn't have any way for the painter\n\n09:23.960 --> 09:25.480\n to represent them remotely anyway.\n\n09:25.480 --> 09:27.680\n How would they even know what they looked like?\n\n09:27.680 --> 09:29.640\n So these are all great examples\n\n09:29.640 --> 09:32.320\n of how in the early days of different media,\n\n09:32.320 --> 09:34.320\n we perceived the media as being really great,\n\n09:34.320 --> 09:37.800\n but then we evolved through the experience of the media.\n\n09:37.800 --> 09:38.840\n This gets back to what I was saying.\n\n09:38.840 --> 09:40.800\n Maybe the greatest gift of photography\n\n09:40.800 --> 09:42.680\n is that we can see the flaws in a photograph\n\n09:42.680 --> 09:44.520\n and appreciate reality more.\n\n09:44.520 --> 09:46.760\n Maybe the greatest gift of audio recording\n\n09:46.760 --> 09:49.980\n is that we can distinguish that opera singer now\n\n09:49.980 --> 09:52.020\n from that recording of the opera singer\n\n09:52.020 --> 09:53.800\n on the horrible wire recorder.\n\n09:53.800 --> 09:57.500\n So we shouldn't limit ourselves\n\n09:57.500 --> 10:01.280\n by some assumption of stasis that's incorrect.\n\n10:01.280 --> 10:03.840\n So that's the first thing, that's my first answer,\n\n10:03.840 --> 10:05.300\n which is I think the most important one.\n\n10:05.300 --> 10:07.340\n Now, of course, somebody might come back and say,\n\n10:07.340 --> 10:09.400\n oh, but you know, technology can go so far.\n\n10:09.400 --> 10:11.560\n There must be some point at which it would surpass.\n\n10:11.560 --> 10:12.640\n That's a different question.\n\n10:12.640 --> 10:14.760\n I think that's also an interesting question,\n\n10:14.760 --> 10:16.080\n but I think the answer I just gave you\n\n10:16.080 --> 10:17.600\n is actually the more important answer\n\n10:17.600 --> 10:18.960\n to the more important question.\n\n10:18.960 --> 10:20.280\n That's profound, yeah.\n\n10:20.280 --> 10:23.160\n But can you, the second question,\n\n10:23.160 --> 10:26.840\n which you're now making me realize is way different.\n\n10:26.840 --> 10:28.520\n Is it possible to create worlds\n\n10:28.520 --> 10:31.600\n in which people would want to stay\n\n10:31.600 --> 10:32.920\n instead of the real world?\n\n10:32.920 --> 10:33.900\n Well.\n\n10:33.900 --> 10:38.260\n Like, en masse, like large numbers of people.\n\n10:38.260 --> 10:41.360\n What I hope is, you know, as I said before,\n\n10:41.360 --> 10:44.320\n I hope that the experience of virtual worlds\n\n10:44.320 --> 10:49.320\n helps people appreciate this physical world we have\n\n10:49.320 --> 10:51.760\n and feel tender towards it\n\n10:51.760 --> 10:54.580\n and keep it from getting too fucked up.\n\n10:54.580 --> 10:57.040\n That's my hope.\n\n10:57.040 --> 10:58.760\n Do you see all technology in that way?\n\n10:58.760 --> 11:01.920\n So basically technology helps us appreciate\n\n11:02.840 --> 11:06.340\n the more sort of technology free aspect of life.\n\n11:08.240 --> 11:10.760\n Well, media technology.\n\n11:10.760 --> 11:13.480\n You know, I mean, you can stretch that.\n\n11:13.480 --> 11:15.280\n I mean, you can, let me say,\n\n11:15.280 --> 11:17.400\n I could definitely play McLuhan\n\n11:17.400 --> 11:19.080\n and turn this into a general theory.\n\n11:19.080 --> 11:20.120\n It's totally doable.\n\n11:20.120 --> 11:23.200\n The program you just described is totally doable.\n\n11:23.200 --> 11:25.120\n In fact, I will psychically predict\n\n11:25.120 --> 11:26.120\n that if you did the research,\n\n11:26.120 --> 11:29.280\n you could find 20 PhD theses that do that already.\n\n11:29.280 --> 11:31.320\n I don't know, but they might exist.\n\n11:31.320 --> 11:34.920\n But I don't know how much value there is\n\n11:34.920 --> 11:38.780\n in pushing a particular idea that far.\n\n11:38.780 --> 11:41.640\n Claiming that reality isn't a computer in some sense\n\n11:41.640 --> 11:44.880\n seems incoherent to me because we can program it.\n\n11:44.880 --> 11:46.200\n We have technology.\n\n11:46.200 --> 11:48.800\n It seems to obey physical laws.\n\n11:48.800 --> 11:50.680\n What more do you want from it to be a computer?\n\n11:50.680 --> 11:52.200\n I mean, it's a computer of some kind.\n\n11:52.200 --> 11:53.520\n We don't know exactly what kind.\n\n11:53.520 --> 11:54.880\n We might not know how to think about it.\n\n11:54.880 --> 11:57.440\n We're working on it, but.\n\n11:57.440 --> 11:59.200\n Sorry to interrupt, but you're absolutely right.\n\n11:59.200 --> 12:01.940\n Like, that's my fascination with the AI as well,\n\n12:01.940 --> 12:05.240\n is it helps, in the case of AI,\n\n12:05.240 --> 12:07.320\n I see it as a set of techniques\n\n12:07.320 --> 12:10.200\n that help us understand ourselves, understand us humans.\n\n12:10.200 --> 12:12.440\n In the same way, virtual reality,\n\n12:12.440 --> 12:14.400\n and you're putting it brilliantly,\n\n12:14.400 --> 12:17.980\n which it's a way to help us understand reality,\n\n12:17.980 --> 12:22.980\n appreciate and open our eyes more richly to reality.\n\n12:23.700 --> 12:26.060\n That's certainly how I see it.\n\n12:26.060 --> 12:29.840\n And I wish people who become incredibly fascinated,\n\n12:29.840 --> 12:33.900\n who go down the rabbit hole of the different fascinations\n\n12:33.900 --> 12:35.860\n with whether we're in a simulation or not,\n\n12:35.860 --> 12:39.340\n or, you know, there's a whole world of variations on that.\n\n12:40.460 --> 12:41.380\n I wish they'd step back\n\n12:41.380 --> 12:42.860\n and think about their own motivations\n\n12:42.860 --> 12:45.740\n and exactly what they mean, you know?\n\n12:45.740 --> 12:49.980\n And I think the danger with these things is,\n\n12:52.820 --> 12:54.340\n so if you say, is the universe\n\n12:54.340 --> 12:56.300\n some kind of computer broadly,\n\n12:56.300 --> 12:59.780\n it has to be because it's not coherent to say that it isn't.\n\n12:59.780 --> 13:02.200\n On the other hand, to say that that means\n\n13:02.200 --> 13:05.100\n you know anything about what kind of computer,\n\n13:05.100 --> 13:06.300\n that's something very different.\n\n13:06.300 --> 13:07.880\n And the same thing is true for the brain.\n\n13:07.880 --> 13:10.420\n The same thing is true for anything\n\n13:10.420 --> 13:12.020\n where you might use computational metaphors.\n\n13:12.020 --> 13:14.940\n Like, we have to have a bit of modesty about where we stand.\n\n13:14.940 --> 13:19.340\n And the problem I have with these framings of computation\n\n13:19.340 --> 13:21.060\n is these ultimate cosmic questions\n\n13:21.060 --> 13:23.320\n is that it has a way of getting people\n\n13:23.320 --> 13:25.340\n to pretend they know more than they do.\n\n13:25.340 --> 13:28.180\n Can you maybe, this is a therapy session,\n\n13:28.180 --> 13:30.380\n psychoanalyze me for a second.\n\n13:30.380 --> 13:32.260\n I really liked the Elder Scrolls series.\n\n13:32.260 --> 13:36.780\n It's a role playing game, Skyrim, for example.\n\n13:36.780 --> 13:41.780\n Why do I enjoy so deeply just walking around that world?\n\n13:41.780 --> 13:45.140\n And then there's people and you could talk to\n\n13:45.140 --> 13:48.060\n and you can just like, it's an escape.\n\n13:48.060 --> 13:49.820\n But you know, my life is awesome.\n\n13:49.820 --> 13:52.760\n I'm truly happy, but I also am happy\n\n13:52.760 --> 13:56.500\n with the music that's playing in the mountains\n\n13:56.500 --> 14:00.860\n and carrying around a sword and just that.\n\n14:00.860 --> 14:02.380\n I don't know what that is.\n\n14:02.380 --> 14:04.620\n It's very pleasant though to go there.\n\n14:04.620 --> 14:06.540\n And I miss it sometimes.\n\n14:06.540 --> 14:11.540\n I think it's wonderful to love artistic creations.\n\n14:12.380 --> 14:15.980\n It's wonderful to love contact with other people.\n\n14:15.980 --> 14:20.980\n It's wonderful to love play and ongoing evolving\n\n14:21.660 --> 14:24.180\n meaning and patterns with other people.\n\n14:24.180 --> 14:26.940\n I think it's a good thing.\n\n14:30.380 --> 14:31.860\n I'm not like anti tech\n\n14:31.860 --> 14:34.420\n and I'm certainly not anti digital tech.\n\n14:34.420 --> 14:37.260\n I'm anti, as everybody knows by now,\n\n14:37.260 --> 14:41.220\n I think the manipulative economy of social media\n\n14:41.220 --> 14:42.420\n is making everybody nuts and all that.\n\n14:42.420 --> 14:43.980\n So I'm anti that stuff.\n\n14:43.980 --> 14:47.620\n But the core of it, of course, I worked for many, many years\n\n14:47.620 --> 14:49.180\n on trying to make that stuff happen\n\n14:49.180 --> 14:51.040\n because I think it can be beautiful.\n\n14:51.040 --> 14:55.040\n Like I don't like, why not?\n\n14:55.040 --> 14:59.160\n And by the way, there's a thing about humans,\n\n14:59.160 --> 15:03.880\n which is we're problematic.\n\n15:03.880 --> 15:07.900\n Any kind of social interaction with other people\n\n15:07.900 --> 15:10.180\n is gonna have its problems.\n\n15:10.180 --> 15:14.060\n People are political and tricky.\n\n15:14.060 --> 15:16.260\n And like, I love classical music,\n\n15:16.260 --> 15:18.580\n but when you actually go to a classical music thing\n\n15:18.580 --> 15:19.740\n and it turns out, oh, actually,\n\n15:19.740 --> 15:22.020\n this is like a backroom power deal kind of place\n\n15:22.020 --> 15:24.180\n and a big status ritual as well.\n\n15:24.180 --> 15:26.960\n And that's kind of not as fun.\n\n15:27.900 --> 15:29.020\n That's part of the package.\n\n15:29.020 --> 15:30.700\n And the thing is, it's always going to be,\n\n15:30.700 --> 15:34.160\n there's always gonna be a mix of things.\n\n15:34.160 --> 15:38.820\n I don't think the search for purity\n\n15:38.820 --> 15:40.420\n is gonna get you anywhere.\n\n15:40.420 --> 15:42.320\n So I'm not worried about that.\n\n15:42.320 --> 15:44.540\n I worry about the really bad cases\n\n15:44.540 --> 15:48.260\n where we're making ourselves crazy or cruel enough\n\n15:48.260 --> 15:49.280\n that we might not survive.\n\n15:49.280 --> 15:53.500\n And I think the social media criticism rises to that level,\n\n15:53.500 --> 15:54.940\n but I'm glad you enjoy it.\n\n15:54.940 --> 15:55.940\n I think it's great.\n\n15:57.380 --> 15:59.100\n And I like that you basically say\n\n15:59.100 --> 16:02.220\n that every experience has both beauty and darkness,\n\n16:02.220 --> 16:03.660\n as in with classical music.\n\n16:03.660 --> 16:07.220\n I also play classical piano, so I appreciate it very much.\n\n16:07.220 --> 16:08.100\n But it's interesting.\n\n16:08.100 --> 16:10.220\n I mean, every, and even the darkness,\n\n16:10.220 --> 16:11.900\n it's a man's search for meaning\n\n16:11.900 --> 16:15.820\n with Viktor Frankl in the concentration camps.\n\n16:15.820 --> 16:19.280\n Even there, there's opportunity to discover beauty.\n\n16:20.940 --> 16:25.140\n And so that's the interesting thing about humans,\n\n16:25.140 --> 16:27.940\n is the capacity to discover beautiful\n\n16:27.940 --> 16:29.140\n in the darkest of moments,\n\n16:29.140 --> 16:31.660\n but there's always the dark parts too.\n\n16:31.660 --> 16:36.660\n Well, I mean, it's our situation is structurally difficult.\n\n16:37.060 --> 16:42.060\n We are, no, it is, it's true.\n\n16:42.220 --> 16:44.860\n We perceive socially, we depend on each other\n\n16:44.860 --> 16:49.860\n for our sense of place and perception of the world.\n\n16:50.800 --> 16:52.380\n I mean, we're dependent on each other.\n\n16:52.380 --> 16:57.380\n And yet there's also a degree in which we're inevitably,\n\n16:58.300 --> 17:00.100\n we never really let each other down.\n\n17:01.060 --> 17:05.180\n We are set up to be competitive as well as supportive.\n\n17:05.180 --> 17:08.340\n I mean, it's just our fundamental situation\n\n17:08.340 --> 17:10.660\n is complicated and challenging,\n\n17:10.660 --> 17:12.500\n and I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\n17:13.580 --> 17:17.060\n Okay, let's talk about one of the most challenging things.\n\n17:17.060 --> 17:20.860\n One of the things I unfortunately am very afraid of\n\n17:20.860 --> 17:23.420\n being human, allegedly.\n\n17:23.420 --> 17:26.320\n You wrote an essay on death and consciousness\n\n17:26.320 --> 17:28.380\n in which you write a note.\n\n17:28.380 --> 17:29.980\n Certainly the fear of death\n\n17:29.980 --> 17:31.980\n has been one of the greatest driving forces\n\n17:31.980 --> 17:33.460\n in the history of thought\n\n17:33.460 --> 17:37.340\n and in the formation of the character of civilization.\n\n17:37.340 --> 17:39.800\n And yet it is under acknowledged.\n\n17:39.800 --> 17:41.300\n The great book on the subject,\n\n17:41.300 --> 17:43.260\n The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker\n\n17:43.260 --> 17:45.380\n deserves a reconsideration.\n\n17:47.940 --> 17:49.820\n I'm Russian, so I have to ask you about this.\n\n17:49.820 --> 17:51.740\n What's the role of death in life?\n\n17:51.740 --> 17:54.660\n See, you would have enjoyed coming to our house\n\n17:54.660 --> 17:58.620\n because my wife is Russian and we also have,\n\n17:58.620 --> 18:01.380\n we have a piano of such spectacular qualities,\n\n18:01.380 --> 18:03.700\n you wouldn't, you would have freaked out.\n\n18:04.660 --> 18:07.260\n But anyway, we'll let all that go.\n\n18:07.260 --> 18:09.460\n So the context in which,\n\n18:09.460 --> 18:12.660\n I remember that essay sort of,\n\n18:12.660 --> 18:15.060\n this was from maybe the 90s or something.\n\n18:15.060 --> 18:18.940\n And I used to publish in a journal\n\n18:18.940 --> 18:20.620\n called the Journal of Consciousness Studies\n\n18:20.620 --> 18:24.220\n because I was interested in these endless debates\n\n18:24.220 --> 18:26.480\n about consciousness and science,\n\n18:27.820 --> 18:30.740\n which certainly continue today.\n\n18:31.700 --> 18:36.700\n And I was interested in how the fear of death\n\n18:38.580 --> 18:41.740\n and the denial of death played into\n\n18:41.740 --> 18:44.820\n different philosophical approaches to consciousness.\n\n18:44.820 --> 18:49.820\n Because I think on the one hand,\n\n18:53.540 --> 18:58.540\n the sort of sentimental school of dualism,\n\n18:58.780 --> 19:00.300\n meaning the feeling that there's something\n\n19:00.300 --> 19:02.180\n apart from the physical brain,\n\n19:02.180 --> 19:04.140\n some kind of soul or something else,\n\n19:05.040 --> 19:07.100\n is obviously motivated in a sense\n\n19:07.100 --> 19:09.460\n by a hope that whatever that is\n\n19:09.460 --> 19:11.580\n will survive death and continue.\n\n19:11.580 --> 19:15.420\n And that's a very core aspect of a lot of the world religions,\n\n19:15.420 --> 19:19.400\n not all of them, not really, but most of them.\n\n19:21.220 --> 19:26.220\n The thing I noticed is that the opposite of those,\n\n19:26.900 --> 19:28.960\n which might be the sort of hardcore,\n\n19:28.960 --> 19:31.340\n no, the brain's a computer and that's it.\n\n19:31.340 --> 19:36.300\n In a sense, we're motivated in the same way\n\n19:36.300 --> 19:40.700\n with a remarkably similar chain of arguments,\n\n19:40.700 --> 19:43.720\n which is no, the brain's a computer\n\n19:43.720 --> 19:45.580\n and I'm gonna figure it out in my lifetime\n\n19:45.580 --> 19:48.220\n and upload myself and I'll live forever.\n\n19:48.220 --> 19:50.540\n That's interesting.\n\n19:50.540 --> 19:53.540\n Yeah, that's like the implied thought, right?\n\n19:53.540 --> 19:55.900\n Yeah, and so it's kind of this,\n\n19:55.900 --> 19:58.540\n in a funny way, it's the same thing.\n\n20:02.500 --> 20:06.460\n It's peculiar to notice that these people\n\n20:06.460 --> 20:09.580\n who would appear to be opposites in character\n\n20:09.580 --> 20:14.360\n and cultural references and in their ideas\n\n20:14.360 --> 20:16.640\n actually are remarkably similar.\n\n20:16.640 --> 20:20.340\n And to an incredible degree,\n\n20:20.340 --> 20:24.400\n this sort of hardcore computationalist idea\n\n20:24.400 --> 20:28.900\n about the brain has turned into medieval Christianity\n\n20:28.900 --> 20:31.440\n with together, like there's the people who are afraid\n\n20:31.440 --> 20:32.500\n that if you have the wrong thought,\n\n20:32.500 --> 20:34.700\n you'll piss off the super AIs of the future\n\n20:34.700 --> 20:38.420\n who will come back and zap you and all that stuff.\n\n20:38.420 --> 20:41.740\n It's really turned into medieval Christianity\n\n20:41.740 --> 20:43.100\n all over again.\n\n20:43.100 --> 20:46.900\n This is so the Ernest Becker's idea that death,\n\n20:46.900 --> 20:49.620\n the fear of death is the warm at the core,\n\n20:49.620 --> 20:53.740\n which is like, that's the core motivator\n\n20:53.740 --> 20:56.900\n of everything we see humans have created.\n\n20:56.900 --> 21:00.740\n The question is if that fear of mortality is somehow core,\n\n21:00.740 --> 21:03.740\n is like a prerequisite to consciousness.\n\n21:03.740 --> 21:08.740\n You just moved across this vast cultural chasm\n\n21:10.380 --> 21:13.260\n that separates me from most of my colleagues in a way.\n\n21:13.260 --> 21:15.540\n And I can't answer what you just said on the level\n\n21:15.540 --> 21:18.220\n without this huge deconstruction.\n\n21:18.220 --> 21:19.060\n Should I do it?\n\n21:19.060 --> 21:20.280\n Yes, what's the chasm?\n\n21:20.280 --> 21:21.380\n Okay.\n\n21:21.380 --> 21:23.220\n Let us travel across this vast chasm.\n\n21:23.220 --> 21:25.040\n Okay, I don't believe in AI.\n\n21:25.040 --> 21:26.220\n I don't think there's any AI.\n\n21:26.220 --> 21:28.460\n There's just algorithms, we make them, we control them.\n\n21:28.460 --> 21:30.780\n Now, they're tools, they're not creatures.\n\n21:30.780 --> 21:33.340\n Now, this is something that robs a lot of people,\n\n21:33.340 --> 21:36.180\n the wrong way, and don't I know it.\n\n21:36.180 --> 21:39.500\n When I was young, my main mentor was Marvin Minsky,\n\n21:39.500 --> 21:43.420\n who's the principal author of the computer\n\n21:43.420 --> 21:47.060\n as creature rhetoric that we still use.\n\n21:47.060 --> 21:48.860\n He was the first person to have the idea at all,\n\n21:48.860 --> 21:52.980\n but he certainly populated AI culture\n\n21:52.980 --> 21:55.420\n with most of its tropes, I would say,\n\n21:55.420 --> 21:57.020\n because a lot of the people will say,\n\n21:57.020 --> 21:58.660\n oh, did you hear this new idea about AI?\n\n21:58.660 --> 22:00.420\n And I'm like, yeah, I heard it in 1978.\n\n22:00.420 --> 22:01.980\n Sure, yeah, I remember that.\n\n22:01.980 --> 22:03.660\n So Marvin was really the person.\n\n22:03.660 --> 22:08.540\n And Marvin and I used to argue all the time about this stuff\n\n22:08.540 --> 22:10.340\n because I always rejected it.\n\n22:10.340 --> 22:12.300\n And of all of his,\n\n22:14.740 --> 22:17.820\n of all of his, I wasn't formally his student,\n\n22:17.820 --> 22:19.820\n but I worked for him as a researcher,\n\n22:19.820 --> 22:23.740\n but of all of his students and student like people\n\n22:23.740 --> 22:25.320\n of his young adoptees,\n\n22:26.660 --> 22:28.500\n I think I was the one who argued with him\n\n22:28.500 --> 22:31.460\n about this stuff in particular, and he loved it.\n\n22:31.460 --> 22:33.260\n Yeah, I would have loved to hear that conversation.\n\n22:33.260 --> 22:34.180\n It was fun.\n\n22:34.180 --> 22:36.780\n Did you ever converse to a place?\n\n22:36.780 --> 22:37.620\n Oh, no, no.\n\n22:37.620 --> 22:40.320\n So the very last time I saw him, he was quite frail.\n\n22:40.320 --> 22:45.260\n And I was in Boston, and I was going to the old house\n\n22:45.260 --> 22:47.460\n in Brookline, his amazing house.\n\n22:47.460 --> 22:49.100\n And one of our mutual friends said,\n\n22:49.100 --> 22:52.100\n hey, listen, Marvin's so frail.\n\n22:52.100 --> 22:54.140\n Don't do the argument with him.\n\n22:54.140 --> 22:56.500\n Don't argue about AI, you know?\n\n22:56.500 --> 22:58.940\n And so I said, but Marvin loves that.\n\n22:58.940 --> 23:01.580\n And so I showed up, and he's like, he was frail.\n\n23:01.580 --> 23:04.500\n He looked up and he said, are you ready to argue?\n\n23:04.500 --> 23:09.500\n He's such an amazing person for that.\n\n23:10.300 --> 23:13.940\n So it's hard to summarize this\n\n23:13.940 --> 23:16.240\n because it's decades of stuff.\n\n23:16.240 --> 23:19.700\n The first thing to say is that nobody can claim\n\n23:19.700 --> 23:23.140\n absolute knowledge about whether somebody\n\n23:23.140 --> 23:25.820\n or something else is conscious or not.\n\n23:25.820 --> 23:27.740\n This is all a matter of faith.\n\n23:27.740 --> 23:31.780\n And in fact, I think the whole idea of faith\n\n23:31.780 --> 23:32.900\n needs to be updated.\n\n23:32.900 --> 23:34.060\n So it's not about God,\n\n23:34.060 --> 23:36.180\n but it's just about stuff in the universe.\n\n23:36.180 --> 23:39.380\n We have faith in each other, being conscious.\n\n23:39.380 --> 23:42.180\n And then I used to frame this\n\n23:42.180 --> 23:45.300\n as a thing called the circle of empathy in my old papers.\n\n23:45.300 --> 23:47.960\n And then it turned into a thing\n\n23:47.960 --> 23:49.100\n for the animal rights movement too.\n\n23:49.100 --> 23:50.440\n I noticed Peter Singer using it.\n\n23:50.440 --> 23:52.500\n I don't know if it was coincident or,\n\n23:52.500 --> 23:54.460\n but anyway, there's this idea\n\n23:54.460 --> 23:56.120\n that you draw a circle around yourself\n\n23:56.120 --> 23:58.220\n and the stuff inside is more like you,\n\n23:58.220 --> 24:00.660\n might be conscious, might be deserving of your empathy,\n\n24:00.660 --> 24:02.140\n of your consideration,\n\n24:02.140 --> 24:04.260\n and the stuff outside the circle isn't.\n\n24:04.260 --> 24:08.880\n And outside the circle might be a rock or,\n\n24:10.380 --> 24:11.220\n I don't know.\n\n24:12.660 --> 24:15.460\n And that circle is fundamentally based on faith.\n\n24:15.460 --> 24:16.300\n Well, if you don't know it.\n\n24:16.300 --> 24:17.960\n Your faith in what is and what isn't.\n\n24:17.960 --> 24:21.380\n The thing about this circle is it can't be pure faith.\n\n24:21.380 --> 24:23.820\n It's also a pragmatic decision\n\n24:23.820 --> 24:26.000\n and this is where things get complicated.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:27.880\n If you try to make it too big,\n\n24:27.880 --> 24:29.880\n you suffer from incompetence.\n\n24:29.880 --> 24:33.300\n If you say, I don't wanna kill a bacteria,\n\n24:33.300 --> 24:34.540\n I will not brush my teeth.\n\n24:34.540 --> 24:35.980\n I don't know, like, what do you do?\n\n24:35.980 --> 24:39.120\n Like, there's a competence question\n\n24:39.120 --> 24:41.000\n where you do have to draw the line.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:44.400\n People who make it too small become cruel.\n\n24:44.400 --> 24:46.400\n People are so clannish and political\n\n24:46.400 --> 24:48.620\n and so worried about themselves ending up\n\n24:48.620 --> 24:51.220\n on the bottom of society\n\n24:51.220 --> 24:52.880\n that they are always ready to gang up\n\n24:52.880 --> 24:54.200\n on some designated group.\n\n24:54.200 --> 24:56.240\n And so there's always these people who are being,\n\n24:56.240 --> 24:58.820\n we're always trying to shove somebody out of the circle.\n\n24:58.820 --> 24:59.660\n And so.\n\n24:59.660 --> 25:01.540\n So aren't you shoving AI outside the circle?\n\n25:01.540 --> 25:02.380\n Well, give me a second.\n\n25:02.380 --> 25:03.200\n All right.\n\n25:03.200 --> 25:05.800\n So there's a pragmatic consideration here.\n\n25:05.800 --> 25:09.260\n And so, and the biggest questions\n\n25:09.260 --> 25:11.660\n are probably fetuses and animals lately,\n\n25:11.660 --> 25:13.400\n but AI is getting there.\n\n25:13.400 --> 25:16.920\n Now with AI, I think,\n\n25:19.180 --> 25:21.580\n and I've had this discussion so many times.\n\n25:21.580 --> 25:23.760\n People say, but aren't you afraid if you exclude AI,\n\n25:23.760 --> 25:26.320\n you'd be cruel to some consciousness?\n\n25:26.320 --> 25:29.520\n And then I would say, well, if you include AI,\n\n25:29.520 --> 25:32.840\n you make yourself, you exclude yourself\n\n25:32.840 --> 25:35.880\n from being able to be a good engineer or designer.\n\n25:35.880 --> 25:38.760\n And so you're facing incompetence immediately.\n\n25:38.760 --> 25:41.460\n So like, I really think we need to subordinate algorithms\n\n25:41.460 --> 25:43.580\n and be much more skeptical of them.\n\n25:43.580 --> 25:45.920\n Your intuition, you speak about this brilliantly\n\n25:45.920 --> 25:48.980\n with social media, how things can go wrong.\n\n25:48.980 --> 25:53.980\n Isn't it possible to design systems\n\n25:54.820 --> 25:57.760\n that show compassion, not to manipulate you,\n\n25:57.760 --> 26:01.260\n but give you control and make your life better\n\n26:01.260 --> 26:04.060\n if you so choose to, like grow together with systems.\n\n26:04.060 --> 26:07.080\n And the way we grow with dogs and cats, with pets,\n\n26:07.080 --> 26:09.440\n with significant others in that way,\n\n26:09.440 --> 26:11.520\n they grow to become better people.\n\n26:11.520 --> 26:14.440\n I don't understand why that's fundamentally not possible.\n\n26:14.440 --> 26:18.100\n You're saying oftentimes you get into trouble\n\n26:18.100 --> 26:20.200\n by thinking you know what's good for people.\n\n26:20.200 --> 26:23.000\n Well, look, there's this question\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.600\n of what framework we're speaking in.\n\n26:25.600 --> 26:27.680\n Do you know who Alan Watts was?\n\n26:27.680 --> 26:32.120\n So Alan Watts once said, morality is like gravity\n\n26:32.120 --> 26:35.600\n that in some absolute cosmic sense, there can't be morality\n\n26:35.600 --> 26:37.720\n because at some point it all becomes relative\n\n26:37.720 --> 26:39.120\n and who are we anyway?\n\n26:39.120 --> 26:42.120\n Like morality is relative to us tiny creatures.\n\n26:42.120 --> 26:45.560\n But here on earth, we're with each other,\n\n26:45.560 --> 26:47.920\n this is our frame and morality is a very real thing.\n\n26:47.920 --> 26:48.800\n Same thing with gravity.\n\n26:48.800 --> 26:52.160\n At some point, you get into interstellar space\n\n26:52.160 --> 26:55.200\n and you might not feel much of it, but here we are on earth.\n\n26:55.200 --> 26:57.000\n And I think in the same sense,\n\n26:58.120 --> 27:03.120\n I think this identification with a frame that's quite remote\n\n27:04.440 --> 27:08.680\n cannot be separated from a feeling of wanting to feel\n\n27:08.680 --> 27:11.960\n sort of separate from and superior to other people\n\n27:11.960 --> 27:12.920\n or something like that.\n\n27:12.920 --> 27:16.120\n There's an impulse behind it that I really have to reject.\n\n27:16.120 --> 27:18.480\n And we're just not competent yet\n\n27:18.480 --> 27:21.000\n to talk about these kinds of absolutes.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:24.400\n Okay, so I agree with you that a lot of technologists\n\n27:24.400 --> 27:27.720\n sort of lack this basic respect, understanding\n\n27:27.720 --> 27:29.200\n and love for humanity.\n\n27:29.200 --> 27:30.680\n There's a separation there.\n\n27:30.680 --> 27:32.440\n The thing I'd like to push back against,\n\n27:32.440 --> 27:33.640\n it's not that you disagree,\n\n27:33.640 --> 27:36.240\n but I believe you can create technologies\n\n27:36.240 --> 27:41.160\n and you can create a new kind of technologist engineer\n\n27:41.160 --> 27:44.560\n that does build systems that respect humanity,\n\n27:44.560 --> 27:46.920\n not just respect, but admire humanity,\n\n27:46.920 --> 27:50.600\n that have empathy for common humans, have compassion.\n\n27:51.920 --> 27:52.760\n I mean, no, no, no.\n\n27:52.760 --> 27:57.320\n I think, yeah, I mean, I think musical instruments\n\n27:57.320 --> 27:58.840\n are a great example of that.\n\n27:58.840 --> 28:00.280\n Musical instruments are technologies\n\n28:00.280 --> 28:02.280\n that help people connect in fantastic ways.\n\n28:02.280 --> 28:05.760\n And that's a great example.\n\n28:08.800 --> 28:11.320\n My invention or design during the pandemic period\n\n28:11.320 --> 28:12.520\n was this thing called together mode\n\n28:12.520 --> 28:14.520\n where people see themselves seated sort of\n\n28:14.520 --> 28:19.520\n in a classroom or a theater instead of in squares.\n\n28:20.320 --> 28:25.320\n And it allows them to semi consciously perform to each other\n\n28:26.080 --> 28:29.480\n as if they have proper eye contact,\n\n28:29.480 --> 28:31.600\n as if they're paying attention to each other nonverbally\n\n28:31.600 --> 28:34.000\n and weirdly that turns out to work.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.960\n And so it promotes empathy so far as I can tell.\n\n28:36.960 --> 28:39.320\n I hope it is of some use to somebody.\n\n28:39.320 --> 28:41.800\n The AI idea isn't really new.\n\n28:41.800 --> 28:45.880\n I would say it was born with Adam Smith's invisible hand\n\n28:45.880 --> 28:48.520\n with this idea that we build this algorithmic thing\n\n28:48.520 --> 28:50.720\n and it gets a bit beyond us\n\n28:50.720 --> 28:52.720\n and then we think it must be smarter than us.\n\n28:52.720 --> 28:54.480\n And the thing about the invisible hand\n\n28:54.480 --> 28:57.880\n is absolutely everybody has some line they draw\n\n28:57.880 --> 28:58.720\n where they say, no, no, no,\n\n28:58.720 --> 29:00.480\n we're gonna take control of this thing.\n\n29:00.480 --> 29:01.920\n They might have different lines,\n\n29:01.920 --> 29:03.120\n they might care about different things,\n\n29:03.120 --> 29:05.640\n but everybody ultimately became a Keynesian\n\n29:05.640 --> 29:06.800\n because it just didn't work.\n\n29:06.800 --> 29:08.000\n It really wasn't that smart.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.680\n It was sometimes smart and sometimes it failed, you know?\n\n29:10.680 --> 29:13.680\n And so if you really, you know,\n\n29:13.680 --> 29:16.760\n people who really, really, really wanna believe\n\n29:16.760 --> 29:19.800\n in the invisible hand is infinitely smart,\n\n29:19.800 --> 29:21.680\n screw up their economies terribly.\n\n29:21.680 --> 29:26.360\n You have to recognize the economy as a subservient tool.\n\n29:26.360 --> 29:28.840\n Everybody does when it's to their advantage.\n\n29:28.840 --> 29:30.720\n They might not when it's not to their advantage.\n\n29:30.720 --> 29:33.240\n That's kind of an interesting game that happens.\n\n29:33.240 --> 29:35.720\n But the thing is, it's just like that with our algorithms,\n\n29:35.720 --> 29:40.720\n you know, like, you can have a sort of a Chicago,\n\n29:42.120 --> 29:44.800\n you know, economic philosophy about your computer.\n\n29:44.800 --> 29:46.360\n Say, no, no, no, my things come alive,\n\n29:46.360 --> 29:48.080\n it's smarter than anything.\n\n29:48.080 --> 29:51.840\n I think that there is a deep loneliness within all of us.\n\n29:51.840 --> 29:54.480\n This is what we seek, we seek love from each other.\n\n29:55.360 --> 29:58.600\n I think AI can help us connect deeper.\n\n29:58.600 --> 30:01.240\n Like this is what you criticize social media for.\n\n30:01.240 --> 30:03.880\n I think there's much better ways of doing social media\n\n30:03.880 --> 30:06.720\n than doing social media that doesn't lead to manipulation,\n\n30:06.720 --> 30:09.680\n but instead leads to deeper connection between humans,\n\n30:09.680 --> 30:12.040\n leads to you becoming a better human being.\n\n30:12.040 --> 30:15.240\n And what that requires is some agency on the part of AI\n\n30:15.240 --> 30:18.760\n to be almost like a therapist, I mean, a companion.\n\n30:18.760 --> 30:22.160\n It's not telling you what's right.\n\n30:22.160 --> 30:25.480\n It's not guiding you as if it's an all knowing thing.\n\n30:25.480 --> 30:28.920\n It's just another companion that you can leave at any time.\n\n30:28.920 --> 30:32.000\n You have complete transparency control over.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.760\n There's a lot of mechanisms that you can have\n\n30:34.760 --> 30:38.960\n that are counter to how current social media operates\n\n30:38.960 --> 30:41.600\n that I think is subservient to humans,\n\n30:41.600 --> 30:46.160\n or no, deeply respects human beings\n\n30:46.160 --> 30:47.880\n and is empathetic to their experience\n\n30:47.880 --> 30:48.960\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n30:48.960 --> 30:51.720\n I think it's possible to create AI systems like that.\n\n30:51.720 --> 30:54.720\n And I think they, I mean, that's a technical discussion\n\n30:54.720 --> 30:58.720\n of whether they need to have something that looks like more,\n\n30:58.720 --> 31:03.640\n something that looks like more like AI versus algorithms,\n\n31:03.640 --> 31:05.640\n something that has a identity,\n\n31:05.640 --> 31:09.120\n something that has a personality, all those kinds of things.\n\n31:09.120 --> 31:11.520\n AI systems, and you've spoken extensively\n\n31:11.520 --> 31:16.520\n how AI systems manipulate you within social networks.\n\n31:17.240 --> 31:19.640\n And that's the biggest problem,\n\n31:19.640 --> 31:24.640\n isn't necessarily that there's advertisement\n\n31:24.640 --> 31:29.320\n that social networks present you with advertisements\n\n31:29.320 --> 31:31.120\n that then get you to buy stuff.\n\n31:31.120 --> 31:32.280\n That's not the biggest problem.\n\n31:32.280 --> 31:35.200\n The biggest problem is they then manipulate you.\n\n31:36.240 --> 31:41.240\n They alter your human nature to get you to buy stuff\n\n31:41.400 --> 31:46.320\n or to get you to do whatever the advertiser wants.\n\n31:46.320 --> 31:47.480\n Or maybe you can correct me.\n\n31:47.480 --> 31:49.800\n Yeah, I don't see it quite that way,\n\n31:49.800 --> 31:52.040\n but we can work with that as an approximation.\n\n31:52.040 --> 31:53.120\n Sure, so my...\n\n31:53.120 --> 31:55.880\n I think the actual thing is even sort of more ridiculous\n\n31:55.880 --> 31:58.160\n and stupider than that, but that's okay, let's...\n\n31:58.160 --> 32:02.440\n So my question is, let's not use the word AI,\n\n32:02.440 --> 32:05.320\n but how do we fix it?\n\n32:05.320 --> 32:06.720\n Oh, fixing social media,\n\n32:07.880 --> 32:11.040\n that diverts us into this whole other field in my view,\n\n32:11.040 --> 32:12.560\n which is economics,\n\n32:12.560 --> 32:14.200\n which I always thought was really boring,\n\n32:14.200 --> 32:16.360\n but we have no choice but to turn into economists\n\n32:16.360 --> 32:17.920\n if we wanna fix this problem,\n\n32:17.920 --> 32:19.840\n because it's all about incentives.\n\n32:19.840 --> 32:24.240\n But I've been around this thing since it started,\n\n32:24.240 --> 32:27.200\n and I've been in the meetings\n\n32:27.200 --> 32:31.560\n where the social media companies sell themselves\n\n32:31.560 --> 32:33.840\n to the people who put the most money into them,\n\n32:33.840 --> 32:36.240\n which are usually the big advertising holding companies\n\n32:36.240 --> 32:37.080\n and whatnot.\n\n32:37.080 --> 32:41.360\n And there's this idea that I think is kind of a fiction,\n\n32:41.360 --> 32:45.080\n and maybe it's even been recognized as that by everybody,\n\n32:45.080 --> 32:48.320\n that the algorithm will get really good\n\n32:48.320 --> 32:49.720\n at getting people to buy something.\n\n32:49.720 --> 32:52.080\n Because I think people have looked at their returns\n\n32:52.080 --> 32:53.160\n and looked at what happens,\n\n32:53.160 --> 32:56.280\n and everybody recognizes it's not exactly right.\n\n32:56.280 --> 33:01.280\n It's more like a cognitive access blackmail payment\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:03.520\n at this point.\n\n33:03.520 --> 33:06.000\n Like just to be connected, you're paying the money.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.600\n It's not so much that the persuasion algorithms...\n\n33:08.600 --> 33:10.400\n So Stanford renamed its program,\n\n33:10.400 --> 33:12.240\n but it used to be called Engage Persuade.\n\n33:12.240 --> 33:15.800\n The engage part works, the persuade part is iffy,\n\n33:15.800 --> 33:18.880\n but the thing is that once people are engaged,\n\n33:18.880 --> 33:20.680\n in order for you to exist as a business,\n\n33:20.680 --> 33:21.920\n in order for you to be known at all,\n\n33:21.920 --> 33:23.080\n you have to put money into the...\n\n33:23.080 --> 33:24.440\n Oh, that's dark.\n\n33:24.440 --> 33:25.280\n Oh, no, that's not...\n\n33:25.280 --> 33:27.040\n It doesn't work, but they have to...\n\n33:27.040 --> 33:28.240\n But they're still...\n\n33:28.240 --> 33:31.480\n It's a giant cognitive access blackmail scheme\n\n33:31.480 --> 33:32.520\n at this point.\n\n33:32.520 --> 33:35.240\n So because the science behind the persuade part,\n\n33:35.240 --> 33:39.600\n it's not entirely a failure,\n\n33:39.600 --> 33:41.400\n but it's not what...\n\n33:42.760 --> 33:46.920\n We play make believe that it works more than it does.\n\n33:46.920 --> 33:48.760\n The damage doesn't come...\n\n33:48.760 --> 33:51.240\n Honestly, as I've said in my books,\n\n33:51.240 --> 33:53.360\n I'm not anti advertising.\n\n33:53.360 --> 33:57.240\n I actually think advertising can be demeaning\n\n33:57.240 --> 34:01.320\n and annoying and banal and ridiculous\n\n34:01.320 --> 34:04.240\n and take up a lot of our time with stupid stuff.\n\n34:04.240 --> 34:06.960\n Like there's a lot of ways to criticize advertising\n\n34:06.960 --> 34:11.440\n that's accurate and it can also lie and all kinds of things.\n\n34:11.440 --> 34:13.960\n However, if I look at the biggest picture,\n\n34:13.960 --> 34:17.080\n I think advertising, at least as it was understood\n\n34:17.080 --> 34:20.280\n before social media, helped bring people into modernity\n\n34:20.280 --> 34:24.520\n in a way that overall actually did benefit people overall.\n\n34:24.520 --> 34:27.520\n And you might say, am I contradicting myself\n\n34:27.520 --> 34:29.080\n because I was saying you shouldn't manipulate people?\n\n34:29.080 --> 34:30.440\n Yeah, I am, probably here.\n\n34:30.440 --> 34:31.960\n I mean, I'm not pretending to have\n\n34:31.960 --> 34:35.440\n this perfect airtight worldview without some contradictions.\n\n34:35.440 --> 34:37.880\n I think there's a bit of a contradiction there, so.\n\n34:37.880 --> 34:39.320\n Well, looking at the long arc of history,\n\n34:39.320 --> 34:43.840\n advertisement has, in some parts, benefited society\n\n34:43.840 --> 34:46.600\n because it funded some efforts that perhaps...\n\n34:46.600 --> 34:50.000\n Yeah, I mean, I think like there's a thing\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:53.920\n where sometimes I think it's actually been of some use.\n\n34:53.920 --> 34:58.920\n Now, where the damage comes is a different thing though.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:03.360\n Social media, algorithms on social media\n\n35:03.360 --> 35:04.800\n have to work on feedback loops\n\n35:04.800 --> 35:06.840\n where they present you with stimulus\n\n35:06.840 --> 35:09.040\n and they have to see if you respond to the stimulus.\n\n35:09.040 --> 35:12.520\n Now, the problem is that the measurement mechanism\n\n35:12.520 --> 35:16.480\n for telling if you respond in the engagement feedback loop\n\n35:16.480 --> 35:17.680\n is very, very crude.\n\n35:17.680 --> 35:19.560\n It's things like whether you click more\n\n35:19.560 --> 35:21.640\n or occasionally if you're staring at the screen more\n\n35:21.640 --> 35:23.920\n if there's a forward facing camera that's activated,\n\n35:23.920 --> 35:25.560\n but typically there isn't.\n\n35:25.560 --> 35:29.000\n So you have this incredibly crude back channel of information\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:32.640\n and so it's crude enough that it only catches\n\n35:32.640 --> 35:35.760\n sort of the more dramatic responses from you\n\n35:35.760 --> 35:37.760\n and those are the fight or flight responses.\n\n35:37.760 --> 35:40.160\n Those are the things where you get scared or pissed off\n\n35:40.160 --> 35:43.480\n or aggressive or horny.\n\n35:43.480 --> 35:44.880\n These are these ancient,\n\n35:44.880 --> 35:46.920\n the sort of what are sometimes called the lizard brain\n\n35:46.920 --> 35:51.200\n circuits or whatever, these fast response,\n\n35:51.200 --> 35:55.760\n old, old, old evolutionary business circuits that we have\n\n35:55.760 --> 35:58.800\n that are helpful in survival once in a while\n\n35:58.800 --> 36:00.560\n but are not us at our best.\n\n36:00.560 --> 36:01.640\n They're not who we wanna be.\n\n36:01.640 --> 36:03.480\n They're not how we relate to each other.\n\n36:03.480 --> 36:05.080\n They're this old business.\n\n36:05.080 --> 36:08.200\n So then just when you're engaged using those intrinsically\n\n36:08.200 --> 36:11.080\n totally aside from whatever the topic is,\n\n36:11.080 --> 36:13.920\n you start to get incrementally just a little bit\n\n36:13.920 --> 36:17.200\n more paranoid, xenophobic, aggressive.\n\n36:17.200 --> 36:20.960\n You get a little stupid and you become a jerk\n\n36:20.960 --> 36:22.400\n and it happens slowly.\n\n36:22.400 --> 36:26.080\n It's not like everybody's instantly transformed,\n\n36:26.080 --> 36:28.000\n but it does kind of happen progressively\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.280\n where people who get hooked kind of get drawn\n\n36:30.280 --> 36:33.640\n more and more into this pattern of being at their worst.\n\n36:33.640 --> 36:35.760\n Would you say that people are able to,\n\n36:35.760 --> 36:37.480\n when they get hooked in this way,\n\n36:37.480 --> 36:40.320\n look back at themselves from 30 days ago\n\n36:40.320 --> 36:45.120\n and say, I am less happy with who I am now\n\n36:45.120 --> 36:47.120\n or I'm not happy with who I am now\n\n36:47.120 --> 36:48.800\n versus who I was 30 days ago.\n\n36:48.800 --> 36:50.560\n Are they able to self reflect\n\n36:50.560 --> 36:52.600\n when you take yourself outside of the lizard brain?\n\n36:52.600 --> 36:54.120\n Sometimes.\n\n36:54.120 --> 36:57.200\n I wrote a book about people suggesting people take a break\n\n36:57.200 --> 36:58.880\n from their social media to see what happens\n\n36:58.880 --> 37:01.760\n and maybe even, actually the title of the book\n\n37:01.760 --> 37:04.160\n was just the arguments to delete your account.\n\n37:04.160 --> 37:05.880\n Yeah, 10 arguments.\n\n37:05.880 --> 37:06.720\n 10 arguments.\n\n37:06.720 --> 37:08.480\n Although I always said, I don't know that you should.\n\n37:08.480 --> 37:09.600\n I can give you the arguments.\n\n37:09.600 --> 37:10.440\n It's up to you.\n\n37:10.440 --> 37:11.760\n I'm always very clear about that.\n\n37:11.760 --> 37:13.320\n But you know, I get like,\n\n37:13.320 --> 37:15.560\n I don't have a social media account obviously\n\n37:15.560 --> 37:18.880\n and it's not that easy for people to reach me.\n\n37:18.880 --> 37:21.280\n They have to search out an old fashioned email address\n\n37:21.280 --> 37:23.560\n on a super crappy antiquated website.\n\n37:23.560 --> 37:26.120\n Like it's actually a bit, I don't make it easy.\n\n37:26.120 --> 37:28.680\n And even with that, I get this huge flood of mail\n\n37:28.680 --> 37:30.560\n from people who say, oh, I quit my social media.\n\n37:30.560 --> 37:31.400\n I'm doing so much better.\n\n37:31.400 --> 37:33.240\n I can't believe how bad it was.\n\n37:33.240 --> 37:36.040\n But the thing is, what's for me a huge flood of mail\n\n37:36.040 --> 37:37.720\n would be an imperceptible trickle\n\n37:37.720 --> 37:39.920\n from the perspective of Facebook, right?\n\n37:39.920 --> 37:43.600\n And so I think it's rare for somebody\n\n37:43.600 --> 37:44.840\n to look at themselves and say,\n\n37:44.840 --> 37:46.520\n oh boy, I sure screwed myself over.\n\n37:46.520 --> 37:49.600\n It's a really hard thing to ask of somebody.\n\n37:49.600 --> 37:51.280\n None of us find that easy, right?\n\n37:51.280 --> 37:52.600\n It's just hard.\n\n37:52.600 --> 37:54.320\n The reason I asked this is,\n\n37:54.320 --> 37:58.160\n is it possible to design social media systems\n\n37:58.160 --> 38:01.200\n that optimize for some longer term metrics\n\n38:01.200 --> 38:04.520\n of you being happy with yourself?\n\n38:04.520 --> 38:06.440\n Well see, I don't think you should try\n\n38:06.440 --> 38:08.320\n to engineer personal growth or happiness.\n\n38:08.320 --> 38:10.720\n I think what you should do is design a system\n\n38:10.720 --> 38:12.640\n that's just respectful of the people\n\n38:12.640 --> 38:14.680\n and subordinates itself to the people\n\n38:14.680 --> 38:16.760\n and doesn't have perverse incentives.\n\n38:16.760 --> 38:18.200\n And then at least there's a chance\n\n38:18.200 --> 38:19.800\n of something decent happening.\n\n38:19.800 --> 38:22.080\n You have to recommend stuff, right?\n\n38:22.080 --> 38:24.400\n So you're saying like, be respectful.\n\n38:24.400 --> 38:26.880\n What does that actually mean engineering wise?\n\n38:26.880 --> 38:27.720\n Yeah, curation.\n\n38:27.720 --> 38:30.240\n People have to be responsible.\n\n38:30.240 --> 38:31.680\n Algorithms shouldn't be recommending.\n\n38:31.680 --> 38:33.440\n Algorithms don't understand enough to recommend.\n\n38:33.440 --> 38:35.280\n Algorithms are crap in this era.\n\n38:35.280 --> 38:37.000\n I mean, I'm sorry, they are.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:38.360\n And I'm not saying this as somebody\n\n38:38.360 --> 38:39.360\n as a critic from the outside.\n\n38:39.360 --> 38:40.200\n I'm in the middle of it.\n\n38:40.200 --> 38:41.120\n I know what they can do.\n\n38:41.120 --> 38:41.960\n I know the math.\n\n38:41.960 --> 38:43.400\n I know what the corpora are.\n\n38:45.240 --> 38:46.920\n I know the best ones.\n\n38:46.920 --> 38:49.800\n Our office is funding GPT3 and all these things\n\n38:49.800 --> 38:53.440\n that are at the edge of what's possible.\n\n38:53.440 --> 38:57.400\n And they do not have yet.\n\n38:57.400 --> 39:02.120\n I mean, it still is statistical emergent pseudo semantics.\n\n39:02.120 --> 39:04.120\n It doesn't actually have deep representation\n\n39:04.120 --> 39:05.120\n emerging of anything.\n\n39:05.120 --> 39:07.720\n It's just not like, I mean that I'm speaking the truth here\n\n39:07.720 --> 39:08.600\n and you know it.\n\n39:08.600 --> 39:11.000\n Well, let me push back on this.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:13.080\n This, there's several truths here.\n\n39:13.080 --> 39:15.080\n So one, you're speaking to the way\n\n39:15.080 --> 39:17.040\n certain companies operate currently.\n\n39:17.040 --> 39:18.880\n I don't think it's outside the realm\n\n39:18.880 --> 39:21.760\n of what's technically feasible to do.\n\n39:21.760 --> 39:22.760\n There's just not incentive,\n\n39:22.760 --> 39:26.120\n like companies are not, why fix this thing?\n\n39:26.120 --> 39:29.840\n I am aware that, for example, the YouTube search\n\n39:29.840 --> 39:32.520\n and discovery has been very helpful to me.\n\n39:32.520 --> 39:36.960\n And there's a huge number of, there's so many videos\n\n39:36.960 --> 39:39.160\n that it's nice to have a little bit of help.\n\n39:39.160 --> 39:40.800\n But I'm still in control.\n\n39:40.800 --> 39:41.640\n Let me ask you something.\n\n39:41.640 --> 39:44.400\n Have you done the experiment of letting YouTube\n\n39:44.400 --> 39:46.640\n recommend videos to you either starting\n\n39:46.640 --> 39:49.760\n from a absolutely anonymous random place\n\n39:49.760 --> 39:50.840\n where it doesn't know who you are\n\n39:50.840 --> 39:52.840\n or from knowing who you or somebody else is\n\n39:52.840 --> 39:54.640\n and then going 15 or 20 hops?\n\n39:54.640 --> 39:56.840\n Have you ever done that and just let it go\n\n39:56.840 --> 39:59.640\n top video recommend and then just go 20 hops?\n\n39:59.640 --> 40:00.480\n No, I've not.\n\n40:00.480 --> 40:02.080\n I've done that many times now.\n\n40:02.080 --> 40:05.400\n I have, because of how large YouTube is\n\n40:05.400 --> 40:06.960\n and how widely it's used,\n\n40:06.960 --> 40:10.120\n it's very hard to get to enough scale\n\n40:10.120 --> 40:13.720\n to get a statistically solid result on this.\n\n40:13.720 --> 40:15.280\n I've done it with high school kids,\n\n40:15.280 --> 40:17.800\n with dozens of kids doing it at a time.\n\n40:17.800 --> 40:19.640\n Every time I've done an experiment,\n\n40:19.640 --> 40:22.920\n the majority of times after about 17 or 18 hops,\n\n40:22.920 --> 40:26.640\n you end up in really weird, paranoid, bizarre territory.\n\n40:26.640 --> 40:28.920\n Because ultimately, that is the stuff\n\n40:28.920 --> 40:30.360\n the algorithm rewards the most\n\n40:30.360 --> 40:33.480\n because of the feedback crudeness I was just talking about.\n\n40:33.480 --> 40:36.320\n So I'm not saying that the video\n\n40:36.320 --> 40:37.840\n never recommends something cool.\n\n40:37.840 --> 40:40.000\n I'm saying that its fundamental core\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:43.240\n is one that promotes a paranoid style\n\n40:43.240 --> 40:45.880\n that promotes increasing irritability,\n\n40:45.880 --> 40:49.640\n that promotes xenophobia, promotes fear, anger,\n\n40:49.640 --> 40:53.800\n promotes selfishness, promotes separation between people.\n\n40:53.800 --> 40:57.720\n And the thing is, it's very hard to do this work solidly.\n\n40:57.720 --> 40:59.480\n Many have repeated this experiment\n\n40:59.480 --> 41:01.720\n and yet it still is kind of anecdotal.\n\n41:01.720 --> 41:05.080\n I'd like to do a large citizen science thing sometime\n\n41:05.080 --> 41:06.840\n and do it, but then I think the problem with that\n\n41:06.840 --> 41:09.080\n is YouTube would detect it and then change it.\n\n41:09.080 --> 41:11.640\n Yes, I love that kind of stuff on Twitter.\n\n41:11.640 --> 41:15.920\n So Jack Dorsey has spoken about doing healthy conversations\n\n41:15.920 --> 41:18.600\n on Twitter or optimizing for healthy conversations.\n\n41:18.600 --> 41:20.160\n What that requires within Twitter\n\n41:20.160 --> 41:23.520\n are most likely citizen experiments\n\n41:23.520 --> 41:26.520\n of what does healthy conversation actually look like\n\n41:26.520 --> 41:29.160\n and how do you incentivize those healthy conversations\n\n41:29.160 --> 41:32.160\n you're describing what often happens\n\n41:32.160 --> 41:33.960\n and what is currently happening.\n\n41:33.960 --> 41:36.040\n What I'd like to argue is it's possible\n\n41:36.040 --> 41:39.040\n to strive for healthy conversations,\n\n41:39.040 --> 41:42.040\n not in a dogmatic way of saying,\n\n41:42.040 --> 41:44.800\n I know what healthy conversations are and I will tell you.\n\n41:44.800 --> 41:47.760\n I think one way to do this is to try to look around\n\n41:47.760 --> 41:51.200\n at social, maybe not things that are officially social media,\n\n41:51.200 --> 41:53.360\n but things where people are together online\n\n41:53.360 --> 41:56.120\n and see which ones have more healthy conversations,\n\n41:56.120 --> 42:00.000\n even if it's hard to be completely objective\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:02.520\n in that measurement, you can kind of, at least crudely.\n\n42:02.520 --> 42:05.240\n You could do subjective annotation\n\n42:05.240 --> 42:07.640\n like have a large crowd source annotation.\n\n42:07.640 --> 42:10.960\n One that I've been really interested in is GitHub\n\n42:10.960 --> 42:14.360\n because it could change.\n\n42:14.360 --> 42:17.280\n I'm not saying it'll always be, but for the most part,\n\n42:17.280 --> 42:21.640\n GitHub has had a relatively quite low poison quotient.\n\n42:21.640 --> 42:24.680\n And I think there's a few things about GitHub\n\n42:24.680 --> 42:26.480\n that are interesting.\n\n42:26.480 --> 42:29.400\n One thing about it is that people have a stake in it.\n\n42:29.400 --> 42:31.720\n It's not just empty status games.\n\n42:31.720 --> 42:35.040\n There's actual code or there's actual stuff being done.\n\n42:35.040 --> 42:37.360\n And I think as soon as you have a real world stake\n\n42:37.360 --> 42:40.760\n in something, you have a motivation\n\n42:40.760 --> 42:42.520\n to not screw up that thing.\n\n42:42.520 --> 42:45.360\n And I think that that's often missing\n\n42:45.360 --> 42:48.080\n that there's no incentive for the person\n\n42:48.080 --> 42:49.480\n to really preserve something.\n\n42:49.480 --> 42:51.440\n If they get a little bit of attention\n\n42:51.440 --> 42:55.840\n from dumping on somebody's TikTok or something,\n\n42:55.840 --> 42:56.840\n they don't pay any price for it.\n\n42:56.840 --> 43:00.640\n But you have to kind of get decent with people\n\n43:00.640 --> 43:03.040\n when you have a shared stake, a little secret.\n\n43:03.040 --> 43:05.040\n So GitHub does a bit of that.\n\n43:06.720 --> 43:08.520\n GitHub is wonderful, yes.\n\n43:08.520 --> 43:13.200\n But I'm tempted to play the Jaren Becker at you,\n\n43:13.200 --> 43:16.320\n which is that, so GitHub is currently is amazing.\n\n43:16.320 --> 43:18.280\n But the thing is, if you have a stake,\n\n43:18.280 --> 43:20.360\n then if it's a social media platform,\n\n43:20.360 --> 43:22.440\n they can use the fact that you have a stake\n\n43:22.440 --> 43:25.200\n to manipulate you because you want to preserve the stake.\n\n43:25.200 --> 43:26.120\n So like, so like.\n\n43:26.120 --> 43:27.680\n Right, well, this is why,\n\n43:27.680 --> 43:29.160\n all right, this gets us into the economics.\n\n43:29.160 --> 43:30.800\n So there's this thing called data dignity\n\n43:30.800 --> 43:32.920\n that I've been studying for a long time.\n\n43:32.920 --> 43:34.840\n I wrote a book about an earlier version of it\n\n43:34.840 --> 43:36.960\n called Who Owns the Future?\n\n43:36.960 --> 43:39.920\n And the basic idea of it is that,\n\n43:41.680 --> 43:43.360\n once again, this is a 30 year conversation.\n\n43:43.360 --> 43:44.200\n It's a fascinating topic.\n\n43:44.200 --> 43:46.720\n Let me do the fastest version of this I can do.\n\n43:46.720 --> 43:48.720\n The fastest way I know how to do this\n\n43:48.720 --> 43:51.880\n is to compare two futures, all right?\n\n43:51.880 --> 43:55.520\n So future one is then the normative one,\n\n43:55.520 --> 43:56.960\n the one we're building right now.\n\n43:56.960 --> 44:00.160\n And future two is gonna be data dignity, okay?\n\n44:00.160 --> 44:03.000\n And I'm gonna use a particular population.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.200\n I live on the hill in Berkeley.\n\n44:05.200 --> 44:06.880\n And one of the features about the hill\n\n44:06.880 --> 44:08.080\n is that as the climate changes,\n\n44:08.080 --> 44:10.720\n we might burn down and I'll lose our houses\n\n44:10.720 --> 44:11.560\n or die or something.\n\n44:11.560 --> 44:14.160\n Like it's dangerous, you know, and it didn't used to be.\n\n44:14.160 --> 44:16.920\n And so who keeps us alive?\n\n44:16.920 --> 44:18.280\n Well, the city does.\n\n44:18.280 --> 44:19.440\n The city does some things.\n\n44:19.440 --> 44:21.360\n The electric company kind of sort of,\n\n44:21.360 --> 44:22.480\n maybe hopefully better.\n\n44:23.360 --> 44:25.920\n Individual people who own property\n\n44:25.920 --> 44:26.880\n take care of their property.\n\n44:26.880 --> 44:27.720\n That's all nice.\n\n44:27.720 --> 44:29.160\n But there's this other middle layer,\n\n44:29.160 --> 44:30.880\n which is fascinating to me,\n\n44:30.880 --> 44:33.480\n which is that the groundskeepers\n\n44:33.480 --> 44:35.240\n who work up and down that hill,\n\n44:35.240 --> 44:38.600\n many of whom are not legally here,\n\n44:38.600 --> 44:40.440\n many of whom don't speak English,\n\n44:40.440 --> 44:42.480\n cooperate with each other\n\n44:42.480 --> 44:44.240\n to make sure trees don't touch\n\n44:44.240 --> 44:46.560\n to transfer fire easily from lot to lot.\n\n44:46.560 --> 44:48.040\n They have this whole little web\n\n44:48.040 --> 44:49.080\n that's keeping us safe.\n\n44:49.080 --> 44:50.400\n I didn't know about this at first.\n\n44:50.400 --> 44:52.400\n I just started talking to them\n\n44:52.400 --> 44:54.240\n because they were out there during the pandemic.\n\n44:54.240 --> 44:56.720\n And so I try to just see who are these people?\n\n44:56.720 --> 44:59.240\n Who are these people who are keeping us alive?\n\n44:59.240 --> 45:01.400\n Now, I want to talk about the two different phases\n\n45:01.400 --> 45:04.800\n for those people in your future one and future two.\n\n45:04.800 --> 45:09.800\n Future one, some weird like kindergarten paint job van\n\n45:10.320 --> 45:11.880\n with all these like cameras and weird things,\n\n45:11.880 --> 45:13.680\n drives up, observes what the gardeners\n\n45:13.680 --> 45:15.520\n and groundskeepers are doing.\n\n45:15.520 --> 45:18.120\n A few years later, some amazing robots\n\n45:18.120 --> 45:20.400\n that can shimmy up trees and all this show up.\n\n45:20.400 --> 45:21.520\n All those people are out of work\n\n45:21.520 --> 45:23.040\n and there are these robots doing the thing\n\n45:23.040 --> 45:23.960\n and the robots are good.\n\n45:23.960 --> 45:26.280\n And they can scale to more land\n\n45:26.280 --> 45:28.360\n and they're actually good.\n\n45:28.360 --> 45:29.920\n But then there are all these people out of work\n\n45:29.920 --> 45:31.240\n and these people have lost dignity.\n\n45:31.240 --> 45:32.840\n They don't know what they're going to do.\n\n45:32.840 --> 45:34.240\n And then somebody will say,\n\n45:34.240 --> 45:35.680\n well, they go on basic income, whatever.\n\n45:35.680 --> 45:38.960\n They become wards of the state.\n\n45:38.960 --> 45:42.520\n My problem with that solution is every time in history\n\n45:42.520 --> 45:44.280\n that you've had some centralized thing\n\n45:44.280 --> 45:45.560\n that's doling out the benefits,\n\n45:45.560 --> 45:47.200\n that things get seized by people\n\n45:47.200 --> 45:49.480\n because it's too centralized and it gets seized.\n\n45:49.480 --> 45:52.120\n This happened to every communist experiment I can find.\n\n45:53.160 --> 45:55.960\n So I think that turns into a poor future\n\n45:55.960 --> 45:57.640\n that will be unstable.\n\n45:57.640 --> 45:59.160\n I don't think people will feel good in it.\n\n45:59.160 --> 46:01.400\n I think it'll be a political disaster\n\n46:01.400 --> 46:04.440\n with a sequence of people seizing this central source\n\n46:04.440 --> 46:06.720\n of the basic income.\n\n46:06.720 --> 46:08.320\n And you'll say, oh no, an algorithm can do it.\n\n46:08.320 --> 46:09.680\n Then people will seize the algorithm.\n\n46:09.680 --> 46:11.160\n They'll seize control.\n\n46:11.160 --> 46:13.480\n Unless the algorithm is decentralized\n\n46:13.480 --> 46:15.520\n and it's impossible to seize the control.\n\n46:15.520 --> 46:20.000\n Yeah, but 60 something people\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:21.880\n own a quarter of all the Bitcoin.\n\n46:21.880 --> 46:24.040\n Like the things that we think are decentralized\n\n46:24.040 --> 46:25.840\n are not decentralized.\n\n46:25.840 --> 46:27.720\n So let's go to future two.\n\n46:27.720 --> 46:32.360\n Future two, the gardeners see that van with all the cameras\n\n46:32.360 --> 46:33.560\n and the kindergarten paint job,\n\n46:33.560 --> 46:35.320\n and they say, the groundskeepers,\n\n46:35.320 --> 46:37.560\n and they say, hey, the robots are coming.\n\n46:37.560 --> 46:38.880\n We're going to form a data union.\n\n46:38.880 --> 46:43.240\n And amazingly, California has a little baby data union law\n\n46:43.240 --> 46:44.080\n emerging in the books.\n\n46:44.080 --> 46:45.560\n Yes.\n\n46:45.560 --> 46:50.560\n And so they say, we're going to form a data union\n\n46:52.520 --> 46:53.600\n and we're going to,\n\n46:53.600 --> 46:56.280\n not only are we going to sell our data to this place,\n\n46:56.280 --> 46:57.880\n but we're going to make it better than it would have been\n\n46:57.880 --> 47:00.040\n if they were just grabbing it without our cooperation.\n\n47:00.040 --> 47:01.720\n And we're going to improve it.\n\n47:01.720 --> 47:03.320\n We're going to make the robots more effective.\n\n47:03.320 --> 47:04.160\n We're going to make them better\n\n47:04.160 --> 47:05.280\n and we're going to be proud of it.\n\n47:05.280 --> 47:08.400\n We're going to become a new class of experts\n\n47:08.400 --> 47:09.760\n that are respected.\n\n47:09.760 --> 47:11.680\n And then here's the interesting,\n\n47:11.680 --> 47:14.480\n there's two things that are different about that world\n\n47:14.480 --> 47:15.600\n from future one.\n\n47:15.600 --> 47:17.600\n One thing, of course, the people have more pride.\n\n47:17.600 --> 47:22.600\n They have more sense of ownership, of agency,\n\n47:23.800 --> 47:27.200\n but what the robots do changes.\n\n47:27.200 --> 47:29.960\n Instead of just like this functional,\n\n47:29.960 --> 47:31.560\n like we'll figure out how to keep the neighborhood\n\n47:31.560 --> 47:32.640\n from burning down,\n\n47:33.520 --> 47:35.320\n you have this whole creative community\n\n47:35.320 --> 47:36.480\n that wasn't there before thinking,\n\n47:36.480 --> 47:38.000\n well, how can we make these robots better\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:39.680\n so we can keep on earning money?\n\n47:39.680 --> 47:44.240\n There'll be waves of creative groundskeeping\n\n47:44.240 --> 47:46.320\n with spiral pumping, pumpkin patches\n\n47:46.320 --> 47:47.920\n and waves of cultural things.\n\n47:47.920 --> 47:49.440\n There'll be new ideas like,\n\n47:49.440 --> 47:51.520\n wow, I wonder if we could do something\n\n47:51.520 --> 47:54.400\n about climate change mitigation with how we do this.\n\n47:54.400 --> 47:56.400\n What about, what about fresh water?\n\n47:56.400 --> 47:59.120\n Can we, what about, can we make the food healthier?\n\n47:59.120 --> 48:00.400\n What about, what about all of a sudden\n\n48:00.400 --> 48:03.280\n there'll be this whole creative community on the case?\n\n48:03.280 --> 48:06.080\n And isn't it nicer to have a high tech future\n\n48:06.080 --> 48:07.520\n with more creative classes\n\n48:07.520 --> 48:09.200\n than one with more dependent classes?\n\n48:09.200 --> 48:10.400\n Isn't that a better future?\n\n48:10.400 --> 48:14.560\n But, but, but, but, future one and future two\n\n48:14.560 --> 48:17.440\n have the same robots and the same algorithms.\n\n48:17.440 --> 48:19.200\n There's no technological difference.\n\n48:19.200 --> 48:20.480\n There's only a human difference.\n\n48:21.520 --> 48:23.760\n And that second future two, that's data dignity.\n\n48:25.600 --> 48:27.120\n The economy that you're, I mean,\n\n48:27.120 --> 48:29.120\n the game theory here is on the humans\n\n48:29.120 --> 48:31.600\n and then the technology is just the tools\n\n48:31.600 --> 48:33.360\n that enable both possibilities.\n\n48:33.360 --> 48:36.240\n I mean, I think you can believe in AI\n\n48:36.240 --> 48:37.440\n and be in future two.\n\n48:37.440 --> 48:38.560\n I just think it's a little harder.\n\n48:38.560 --> 48:43.280\n You have to do more contortions, it's possible.\n\n48:43.280 --> 48:45.360\n So in the case of social media,\n\n48:46.080 --> 48:49.120\n what does data dignity look like?\n\n48:49.120 --> 48:51.440\n Is it people getting paid for their data?\n\n48:51.440 --> 48:55.200\n Yeah, I think what should happen is in the future\n\n48:55.200 --> 48:57.920\n there should be massive data unions\n\n48:59.280 --> 49:03.920\n for people putting content into the system\n\n49:03.920 --> 49:05.840\n and those data unions should smooth out\n\n49:05.840 --> 49:06.800\n the results a little bit.\n\n49:06.800 --> 49:09.440\n So it's not winner take all, but at the same time,\n\n49:10.400 --> 49:11.600\n and people have to pay for it too.\n\n49:11.600 --> 49:13.520\n They have to pay for Facebook\n\n49:13.520 --> 49:14.960\n the way they pay for Netflix\n\n49:14.960 --> 49:17.360\n with an allowance for the poor.\n\n49:17.360 --> 49:20.160\n There has to be a way out too.\n\n49:20.160 --> 49:22.080\n But the thing is people do pay for Netflix.\n\n49:22.080 --> 49:23.120\n It's a going concern.\n\n49:24.320 --> 49:26.160\n People pay for Xbox and PlayStation.\n\n49:26.160 --> 49:27.760\n Like people, there's enough people\n\n49:27.760 --> 49:28.880\n to pay for stuff they want.\n\n49:28.880 --> 49:29.680\n This could happen too.\n\n49:29.680 --> 49:31.280\n It's just that this precedent started\n\n49:31.280 --> 49:33.040\n that moved it in the wrong direction.\n\n49:33.040 --> 49:34.640\n And then what has to happen,\n\n49:34.640 --> 49:36.320\n the economy is a measuring device.\n\n49:36.320 --> 49:38.320\n If it's an honest measuring device,\n\n49:39.280 --> 49:42.560\n the outcomes for people form a normal distribution,\n\n49:42.560 --> 49:43.600\n a bell curve.\n\n49:43.600 --> 49:45.280\n And then, so there should be a few people\n\n49:45.280 --> 49:47.680\n who do really well, a lot of people who do okay.\n\n49:47.680 --> 49:49.840\n And then we should have an expanding economy\n\n49:49.840 --> 49:52.960\n reflecting more and more creativity and expertise\n\n49:52.960 --> 49:54.640\n flowing through the network.\n\n49:54.640 --> 49:57.040\n And that expanding economy moves the result\n\n49:57.040 --> 49:57.840\n just a bit forward.\n\n49:57.840 --> 50:00.000\n So more people are getting money out of it\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:01.280\n than are putting money into it.\n\n50:01.280 --> 50:03.040\n So it gradually expands the economy\n\n50:03.040 --> 50:04.480\n and lifts all boats.\n\n50:04.480 --> 50:08.000\n And the society has to support the lower wing\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.720\n of the bell curve too, but not universal basic income.\n\n50:10.720 --> 50:12.800\n It has to be for the,\n\n50:12.800 --> 50:15.280\n cause if it's an honest economy,\n\n50:15.280 --> 50:17.760\n there will be that lower wing\n\n50:17.760 --> 50:19.360\n and we have to support those people.\n\n50:19.360 --> 50:20.720\n There has to be a safety net.\n\n50:21.600 --> 50:24.720\n But see what I believe, I'm not gonna talk about AI,\n\n50:24.720 --> 50:27.680\n but I will say that I think there'll be more\n\n50:27.680 --> 50:29.760\n and more algorithms that are useful.\n\n50:29.760 --> 50:33.440\n And so I don't think everybody's gonna be supplying data\n\n50:33.440 --> 50:34.800\n to grounds keeping robots,\n\n50:34.800 --> 50:36.640\n nor do I think everybody's gonna make their living\n\n50:36.640 --> 50:37.440\n with TikTok videos.\n\n50:37.440 --> 50:38.800\n I think in both cases,\n\n50:38.800 --> 50:41.120\n there'll be a rather small contingent\n\n50:41.680 --> 50:43.920\n that do well enough at either of those things.\n\n50:43.920 --> 50:46.880\n But I think there might be many, many, many,\n\n50:46.880 --> 50:48.640\n many of those niches that start to evolve\n\n50:48.640 --> 50:49.920\n as there are more and more algorithms,\n\n50:49.920 --> 50:50.880\n more and more robots.\n\n50:50.880 --> 50:54.160\n And it's that large number that will create\n\n50:54.160 --> 50:57.280\n the economic potential for a very large part of society\n\n50:57.280 --> 51:00.080\n to become members of new creative classes.\n\n51:00.080 --> 51:05.040\n Do you think it's possible to create a social network\n\n51:05.040 --> 51:06.640\n that competes with Twitter and Facebook\n\n51:06.640 --> 51:08.800\n that's large and centralized in this way?\n\n51:08.800 --> 51:10.880\n Not centralized, sort of large, large.\n\n51:10.880 --> 51:13.280\n How to get, all right, so I gotta tell you\n\n51:13.280 --> 51:16.400\n how to get from where we are\n\n51:16.400 --> 51:18.160\n to anything kind of in the zone\n\n51:18.160 --> 51:20.960\n of what I'm talking about is challenging.\n\n51:22.400 --> 51:24.640\n I know some of the people who run,\n\n51:24.640 --> 51:26.960\n like I know Jack Dorsey at H1N1,\n\n51:26.960 --> 51:31.840\n and I view Jack as somebody who's actually,\n\n51:34.720 --> 51:36.800\n I think he's really striving and searching\n\n51:36.800 --> 51:38.720\n and trying to find a way to make it better,\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:41.520\n but is kind of like,\n\n51:42.240 --> 51:44.080\n it's very hard to do it while in flight\n\n51:44.080 --> 51:46.240\n and he's under enormous business pressure too.\n\n51:46.240 --> 51:49.520\n So Jack Dorsey to me is a fascinating study\n\n51:49.520 --> 51:52.480\n because I think his mind is in a lot of good places.\n\n51:52.480 --> 51:54.400\n He's a good human being,\n\n51:54.400 --> 51:56.320\n but there's a big Titanic ship\n\n51:56.320 --> 51:57.760\n that's already moving in one direction.\n\n51:57.760 --> 51:59.040\n It's hard to know what to do with it.\n\n51:59.040 --> 52:00.720\n I think that's the story of Twitter.\n\n52:00.720 --> 52:02.000\n I think that's the story of Twitter.\n\n52:02.560 --> 52:04.480\n One of the things that I observed is that\n\n52:04.480 --> 52:06.400\n if you just wanna look at the human side,\n\n52:06.400 --> 52:08.560\n meaning like how are people being changed?\n\n52:08.560 --> 52:09.360\n How do they feel?\n\n52:09.360 --> 52:10.640\n What does the culture like?\n\n52:11.360 --> 52:15.760\n Almost all of the social media platforms that get big\n\n52:15.760 --> 52:17.840\n have an initial sort of honeymoon period\n\n52:17.840 --> 52:19.680\n where they're actually kind of sweet and cute.\n\n52:19.680 --> 52:20.080\n Yeah.\n\n52:20.080 --> 52:22.160\n Like if you look at the early years of Twitter,\n\n52:22.160 --> 52:23.520\n it was really sweet and cute,\n\n52:23.520 --> 52:27.360\n but also look at Snap, TikTok.\n\n52:27.360 --> 52:29.680\n And then what happens is as they scale\n\n52:30.240 --> 52:32.560\n and the algorithms become more influential\n\n52:32.560 --> 52:33.920\n instead of just the early people,\n\n52:33.920 --> 52:36.720\n when it gets big enough that it's the algorithm running it,\n\n52:36.720 --> 52:39.440\n then you start to see the rise of the paranoid style\n\n52:39.440 --> 52:40.640\n and then they start to get dark.\n\n52:40.640 --> 52:43.600\n And we've seen that shift in TikTok rather recently.\n\n52:43.600 --> 52:48.560\n But I feel like that scaling reveals the flaws\n\n52:48.560 --> 52:49.680\n within the incentives.\n\n52:51.520 --> 52:52.720\n I feel like I'm torturing you.\n\n52:52.720 --> 52:53.520\n I'm sorry.\n\n52:53.520 --> 52:54.320\n It's not torture.\n\n52:54.320 --> 53:00.160\n No, because I have hope for the world with humans\n\n53:00.160 --> 53:02.640\n and I have hope for a lot of things that humans create,\n\n53:02.640 --> 53:04.160\n including technology.\n\n53:04.160 --> 53:07.520\n And I just, I feel it is possible to create\n\n53:07.520 --> 53:10.160\n social media platforms that incentivize\n\n53:11.760 --> 53:13.280\n different things than the current.\n\n53:13.280 --> 53:16.000\n I think the current incentivization is around\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:19.040\n like the dumbest possible thing that was invented\n\n53:19.040 --> 53:21.600\n like 20 years ago, however long.\n\n53:21.600 --> 53:24.000\n And it just works and so nobody's changing it.\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:26.560\n I just think that there could be a lot of innovation\n\n53:26.560 --> 53:29.360\n for more, see, you kind of push back this idea\n\n53:29.360 --> 53:32.720\n that we can't know what longterm growth or happiness is.\n\n53:33.600 --> 53:36.160\n If you give control to people to define\n\n53:36.160 --> 53:39.280\n what their longterm happiness and goals are,\n\n53:39.280 --> 53:42.320\n then that optimization can happen\n\n53:42.320 --> 53:43.840\n for each of those individual people.\n\n53:43.840 --> 53:50.480\n Well, I mean, imagine a future where\n\n53:53.040 --> 53:57.600\n probably a lot of people would love to make their living\n\n53:57.600 --> 54:01.200\n doing TikTok dance videos, but people recognize generally\n\n54:01.920 --> 54:03.760\n that's kind of hard to get into.\n\n54:03.760 --> 54:07.440\n Nonetheless, dance crews have an experience\n\n54:07.440 --> 54:10.800\n that's very similar to programmers working together on GitHub.\n\n54:10.800 --> 54:14.000\n So the future is like a cross between TikTok and GitHub\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:18.160\n and they get together and they have rights.\n\n54:18.160 --> 54:21.280\n They're negotiating for returns.\n\n54:21.280 --> 54:23.600\n They join different artists societies\n\n54:23.600 --> 54:26.800\n in order to soften the blow of the randomness\n\n54:26.800 --> 54:29.120\n of who gets the network effect benefit\n\n54:29.120 --> 54:30.480\n because nobody can know that.\n\n54:31.040 --> 54:35.520\n And I think an individual person\n\n54:35.520 --> 54:37.680\n might join a thousand different data unions\n\n54:37.680 --> 54:40.160\n in the course of their lives, or maybe even 10,000.\n\n54:40.160 --> 54:42.000\n I don't know, but the point is that we'll have\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:45.520\n like these very hedge distributed portfolios\n\n54:45.520 --> 54:47.200\n of different data unions we're part of.\n\n54:47.760 --> 54:50.080\n And some of them might just trickle in a little money\n\n54:50.080 --> 54:52.720\n for nonsense stuff where we're contributing\n\n54:52.720 --> 54:54.000\n to health studies or something.\n\n54:54.880 --> 54:56.880\n But I think people will find their way.\n\n54:56.880 --> 55:00.320\n They'll find their way to the right GitHub like community\n\n55:00.320 --> 55:03.680\n in which they find their value in the context\n\n55:03.680 --> 55:07.200\n of supplying inputs and data and taste\n\n55:07.200 --> 55:11.200\n and correctives and all of this into the algorithms\n\n55:11.200 --> 55:12.320\n and the robots of the future.\n\n55:14.640 --> 55:16.560\n And that is a way to resist\n\n55:18.720 --> 55:22.880\n the lizard brain based funding system mechanisms.\n\n55:22.880 --> 55:25.120\n It's an alternate economic system\n\n55:25.120 --> 55:27.680\n that rewards productivity, creativity,\n\n55:28.800 --> 55:30.240\n value as perceived by others.\n\n55:30.240 --> 55:31.360\n It's a genuine market.\n\n55:31.360 --> 55:32.960\n It's not doled out from a center.\n\n55:32.960 --> 55:36.160\n There's not some communist person deciding who's valuable.\n\n55:36.160 --> 55:37.200\n It's actual market.\n\n55:38.560 --> 55:43.280\n And the money is made by supporting that\n\n55:43.280 --> 55:46.320\n instead of just grabbing people's attention\n\n55:46.320 --> 55:47.520\n in the cheapest possible way,\n\n55:47.520 --> 55:49.760\n which is definitely how you get the lizard brain.\n\n55:49.760 --> 55:51.040\n Yeah, okay.\n\n55:51.040 --> 55:52.880\n So we're finally at the agreement.\n\n55:55.600 --> 55:57.280\n But I just think that...\n\n55:59.120 --> 56:03.120\n So yeah, I'll tell you how I think to fix social media.\n\n56:03.120 --> 56:05.360\n There's a few things.\n\n56:05.360 --> 56:07.840\n So one, I think people should have complete control\n\n56:07.840 --> 56:11.600\n over their data and transparency of what that data is\n\n56:11.600 --> 56:14.640\n and how it's being used if they do hand over the control.\n\n56:14.640 --> 56:16.400\n Another thing they should be able to delete,\n\n56:16.400 --> 56:19.520\n walk away with their data at any moment, easy.\n\n56:19.520 --> 56:22.000\n Like with a single click of a button, maybe two buttons,\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:24.880\n I don't know, just easily walk away with their data.\n\n56:26.240 --> 56:28.080\n The other is control of the algorithm,\n\n56:28.080 --> 56:30.480\n individualized control of the algorithm for them.\n\n56:31.120 --> 56:33.360\n So each one has their own algorithm.\n\n56:33.360 --> 56:34.720\n Each person has their own algorithm.\n\n56:34.720 --> 56:38.960\n They get to be the decider of what they see in this world.\n\n56:38.960 --> 56:42.880\n And to me, that's, I guess, fundamentally decentralized\n\n56:43.680 --> 56:45.920\n in terms of the key decisions being made.\n\n56:45.920 --> 56:47.360\n But if that's made transparent,\n\n56:47.360 --> 56:50.080\n I feel like people will choose that system\n\n56:50.080 --> 56:53.360\n over Twitter of today, over Facebook of today,\n\n56:53.360 --> 56:55.200\n when they have the ability to walk away,\n\n56:55.200 --> 56:56.560\n to control their data\n\n56:56.560 --> 56:58.960\n and to control the kinds of things they see.\n\n56:58.960 --> 57:01.520\n Now, let's walk away from the term AI.\n\n57:01.520 --> 57:02.320\n You're right.\n\n57:02.320 --> 57:05.360\n In this case, you have full control\n\n57:05.360 --> 57:07.360\n of the algorithms that help you\n\n57:07.360 --> 57:09.760\n if you want to use their help.\n\n57:09.760 --> 57:12.320\n But you can also say a few to those algorithms\n\n57:12.320 --> 57:16.400\n and just consume the raw, beautiful waterfall\n\n57:17.680 --> 57:18.800\n of the internet.\n\n57:18.800 --> 57:22.960\n I think that, to me, that's not only fixes social media,\n\n57:22.960 --> 57:24.800\n but I think it would make a lot more money.\n\n57:24.800 --> 57:26.560\n So I would like to challenge the idea.\n\n57:26.560 --> 57:27.760\n I know you're not presenting that,\n\n57:27.760 --> 57:30.400\n but that the only way to make a ton of money\n\n57:30.400 --> 57:32.320\n is to operate like Facebook is.\n\n57:32.320 --> 57:35.600\n I think you can make more money by giving people control.\n\n57:36.240 --> 57:38.320\n Yeah, I mean, I certainly believe that.\n\n57:38.320 --> 57:40.160\n We're definitely in the territory\n\n57:40.160 --> 57:43.680\n of a wholehearted agreement here.\n\n57:44.880 --> 57:47.040\n I do want to caution against one thing,\n\n57:47.040 --> 57:50.880\n which is making a future that benefits programmers\n\n57:50.880 --> 57:53.680\n versus this idea that people are in control of their data.\n\n57:53.680 --> 57:58.240\n So years ago, I cofounded an advisory board for the EU\n\n57:58.240 --> 57:59.120\n with a guy named Jay.\n\n57:59.120 --> 58:00.960\n Giovanni Bottarelli, who passed away.\n\n58:00.960 --> 58:02.320\n It's one of the reasons I wanted to mention it.\n\n58:02.320 --> 58:04.400\n A remarkable guy who'd been,\n\n58:04.960 --> 58:06.640\n he was originally a prosecutor\n\n58:06.640 --> 58:10.960\n who was throwing mafioso in jail in Sicily.\n\n58:10.960 --> 58:13.920\n So he was like this intense guy who was like,\n\n58:13.920 --> 58:16.080\n I've dealt with death threats.\n\n58:16.080 --> 58:17.840\n Mark Zuckerberg doesn't scare me or whatever.\n\n58:17.840 --> 58:21.040\n So we worked on this path of saying,\n\n58:21.040 --> 58:23.120\n let's make it all about transparency and consent.\n\n58:23.120 --> 58:26.960\n And it was one of the feeders that led to this huge data\n\n58:26.960 --> 58:30.960\n privacy and protection framework in Europe called the GDPR.\n\n58:30.960 --> 58:35.520\n And so therefore we've been able to have empirical feedback\n\n58:35.520 --> 58:36.320\n on how that goes.\n\n58:36.320 --> 58:41.280\n And the problem is that most people actually get stymied\n\n58:41.280 --> 58:44.080\n by the complexity of that kind of management.\n\n58:44.080 --> 58:46.960\n They have trouble and reasonably so.\n\n58:46.960 --> 58:48.720\n I don't, I'm like a techie.\n\n58:48.720 --> 58:51.600\n I can go in and I can figure out what's going on.\n\n58:51.600 --> 58:54.000\n But most people really do.\n\n58:54.000 --> 59:00.000\n And so there's a problem that it differentially benefits\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:02.240\n those who kind of have a technical mindset\n\n59:02.240 --> 59:04.000\n and can go in and sort of have a feeling\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:04.880\n for how this stuff works.\n\n59:05.840 --> 59:08.320\n I kind of still want to come back to incentives.\n\n59:08.320 --> 59:11.840\n And so if the incentive for whoever is,\n\n59:11.840 --> 59:14.320\n if the commercial incentive is to help the creative people\n\n59:14.320 --> 59:15.440\n of the future make more money,\n\n59:15.440 --> 59:16.640\n because you get a cut of it,\n\n59:17.440 --> 59:19.040\n that's how you grow an economy.\n\n59:19.040 --> 59:20.080\n Not the programmers.\n\n59:20.080 --> 59:24.800\n Well, some of them will be programmers.\n\n59:24.800 --> 59:26.560\n It's not anti programmer.\n\n59:26.560 --> 59:30.480\n I'm just saying that it's not only programmers, you know?\n\n59:30.480 --> 59:35.520\n So, yeah, you have to make sure the incentives are right.\n\n59:35.520 --> 59:40.320\n I mean, I like control is an interface problem\n\n59:40.320 --> 59:43.920\n to where you have to create something that's compelling\n\n59:43.920 --> 59:47.920\n to everybody, to the creatives, to the public.\n\n59:47.920 --> 59:51.920\n I mean, there's, I don't know, Creative Commons,\n\n59:51.920 --> 59:57.200\n like the licensing, there's a bunch of legal speak\n\n59:57.200 --> 1:00:00.160\n just in general, the whole legal profession.\n\n1:00:00.160 --> 1:00:01.680\n It's nice when it can be simplified\n\n1:00:01.680 --> 1:00:03.920\n in the way that you can truly simply understand.\n\n1:00:03.920 --> 1:00:07.680\n Everybody can simply understand the basics.\n\n1:00:07.680 --> 1:00:11.280\n In the same way, it should be very simple to understand\n\n1:00:12.560 --> 1:00:14.080\n how the data is being used\n\n1:00:14.800 --> 1:00:17.440\n and what data is being used for people.\n\n1:00:17.440 --> 1:00:20.400\n But then you're arguing that in order for that to happen,\n\n1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:21.760\n you have to have the incentives alike.\n\n1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:25.600\n I mean, a lot of the reason that money works\n\n1:00:26.560 --> 1:00:30.160\n is actually information hiding and information loss.\n\n1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:32.160\n Like one of the things about money\n\n1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:34.240\n is a particular dollar you get\n\n1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:36.320\n might have passed through your enemy's hands\n\n1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:37.600\n and you don't know it.\n\n1:00:37.600 --> 1:00:40.320\n But also, I mean, this is what Adam Smith,\n\n1:00:40.320 --> 1:00:43.440\n if you wanna give the most charitable interpretation possible\n\n1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:45.920\n to the invisible hand is what he was saying,\n\n1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:48.480\n is that like there's this whole complicated thing\n\n1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:50.480\n and not only do you not need to know about it,\n\n1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:52.720\n the truth is you'd never be able to follow it if you tried\n\n1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:55.200\n and just like let the economic incentives\n\n1:00:55.840 --> 1:00:57.120\n solve for this whole thing.\n\n1:00:58.160 --> 1:01:00.880\n And that in a sense, every transaction\n\n1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:02.400\n is like a neuron and a neural net.\n\n1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:05.040\n If he'd had that metaphor, he would have used it\n\n1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:07.920\n and let the whole thing settle to a solution\n\n1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:08.800\n and don't worry about it.\n\n1:01:10.080 --> 1:01:13.520\n I think this idea of having incentives\n\n1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:15.760\n that reduce complexity for people\n\n1:01:15.760 --> 1:01:17.200\n can be made to work.\n\n1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:19.040\n And that's an example of an algorithm\n\n1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:20.480\n that could be manipulative or not,\n\n1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:21.600\n going back to your question before\n\n1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:23.600\n about can you do it in a way that's not manipulative?\n\n1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:28.000\n And I would say a GitHub like,\n\n1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:29.120\n if you just have this vision,\n\n1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:33.200\n GitHub plus TikTok combined, is it possible?\n\n1:01:33.200 --> 1:01:34.160\n I think it is.\n\n1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:34.640\n I really think it is.\n\n1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:37.200\n I'm not gonna be able to unsee that idea\n\n1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:40.320\n of creatives on TikTok collaborating\n\n1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:42.400\n in the same way that people on GitHub collaborate.\n\n1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:42.880\n Why not?\n\n1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:43.840\n I like that kind of version.\n\n1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:45.440\n Why not?\n\n1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:46.320\n I like it, I love it.\n\n1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:48.640\n I just like, right now when people use,\n\n1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:50.240\n by the way, father of teenage daughter.\n\n1:01:50.240 --> 1:01:52.800\n It's all about TikTok, right?\n\n1:01:53.440 --> 1:01:55.440\n So, when people use TikTok,\n\n1:01:55.440 --> 1:01:58.960\n there's a lot of, it's kind of funny,\n\n1:01:58.960 --> 1:01:59.920\n I was gonna say cattiness,\n\n1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:01.440\n but I was just using the cat\n\n1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:03.440\n as this exemplar of what we're talking about.\n\n1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:05.440\n I contradict myself.\n\n1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:07.120\n But anyway, there's all this cattiness\n\n1:02:07.120 --> 1:02:07.760\n where people are like,\n\n1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:09.600\n ee, this person's ee.\n\n1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:13.440\n And I just, what about people getting together\n\n1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:14.640\n and kind of saying,\n\n1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:16.320\n okay, we're gonna work on this move.\n\n1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:17.120\n We're gonna get a better,\n\n1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:18.320\n can we get a better musician?\n\n1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:20.160\n Like, and they do that,\n\n1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:21.920\n but that's the part\n\n1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:25.120\n that's kind of off the books right now.\n\n1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:26.160\n That should be like right there.\n\n1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:27.040\n That should be the center.\n\n1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:29.280\n That's where the, that's the really best part.\n\n1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:31.840\n Well, that's where the invention of Git period,\n\n1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:33.280\n the versioning is brilliant.\n\n1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:35.440\n And so some of the things\n\n1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:36.160\n you're talking about,\n\n1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:40.240\n technology, algorithms, tools can empower.\n\n1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:43.600\n And that's the thing for humans to connect,\n\n1:02:43.600 --> 1:02:44.880\n to collaborate and so on.\n\n1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:47.600\n Can we upset more people a little bit?\n\n1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:50.640\n Maybe we'd have to try.\n\n1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:51.040\n No, no.\n\n1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:53.680\n Can we, can I ask you to elaborate?\n\n1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:55.760\n Cause I, my intuition was that\n\n1:02:55.760 --> 1:02:57.120\n you would be a supporter of something\n\n1:02:57.120 --> 1:02:59.200\n like cryptocurrency and Bitcoin\n\n1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:02.880\n because it is fundamentally emphasizes decentralization.\n\n1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:04.960\n What do you, so can you elaborate?\n\n1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:06.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:06.720\n Okay, look.\n\n1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:07.920\n Your thoughts on Bitcoin.\n\n1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:10.560\n I, it's kind of funny.\n\n1:03:10.560 --> 1:03:14.960\n Um, I, I wrote, I, I've been advocating\n\n1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:17.520\n some kind of digital currency for a long time.\n\n1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:22.800\n And when the, the, uh, when, when Bitcoin came out\n\n1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:25.360\n and the original paper on, on blockchain,\n\n1:03:26.160 --> 1:03:29.200\n um, my heart kind of sank because I thought,\n\n1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:32.560\n Oh my God, we're applying all of this fancy thought\n\n1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:35.280\n and all these very careful distributed security\n\n1:03:35.280 --> 1:03:37.840\n measures to recreate the gold standard.\n\n1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:40.320\n Like it's just so retro.\n\n1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:42.000\n It's so dysfunctional.\n\n1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000\n It's so useless from an economic point of view.\n\n1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.320\n So it's always, and then the other thing\n\n1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:48.880\n is using computational inefficiency\n\n1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:51.680\n at a boundless scale as your form of security\n\n1:03:51.680 --> 1:03:53.920\n is a crime against this atmosphere.\n\n1:03:53.920 --> 1:03:55.360\n Obviously a lot of people know that now,\n\n1:03:55.360 --> 1:03:57.440\n but we knew that at the start.\n\n1:03:57.440 --> 1:03:59.600\n Like the thing is when the first paper came out,\n\n1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:00.560\n I remember a lot of people saying,\n\n1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:02.400\n Oh my God, I think this thing scales.\n\n1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:04.400\n It's a carbon disaster, you know?\n\n1:04:04.400 --> 1:04:09.120\n And, and, um, I, I just like, I'm just mystified,\n\n1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:11.440\n but that's a different question than when you asked,\n\n1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:15.040\n can you have, um, a cryptographic currency\n\n1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:17.280\n or at least some kind of digital currency\n\n1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:18.240\n that's of a benefit?\n\n1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:19.440\n And absolutely.\n\n1:04:19.440 --> 1:04:21.360\n Like I'm, and there are people who are trying\n\n1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:22.560\n to be thoughtful about this.\n\n1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:23.680\n You should, uh, if you haven't,\n\n1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:25.760\n you should interview, uh, Vitalik Buterin sometime.\n\n1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:27.600\n Yeah, I've interviewed him twice.\n\n1:04:27.600 --> 1:04:28.080\n Okay.\n\n1:04:28.080 --> 1:04:29.920\n So like there are people in the community\n\n1:04:29.920 --> 1:04:30.880\n who are trying to be thoughtful\n\n1:04:30.880 --> 1:04:32.800\n and trying to figure out how to do this better.\n\n1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:34.240\n It has nice properties though, right?\n\n1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:36.000\n So the, one of the nice properties is that\n\n1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.240\n like government centralized, it's hard to control.\n\n1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:40.720\n Uh, and then the other one to fix some of the issues\n\n1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:41.600\n that you're referring to,\n\n1:04:41.600 --> 1:04:43.600\n I'm sort of playing devil's advocate here is,\n\n1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:44.880\n you know, there's lightning network.\n\n1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:48.400\n There's ideas how to, how you, uh, build stuff\n\n1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:50.400\n on top of Bitcoin, similar with gold\n\n1:04:50.400 --> 1:04:53.760\n that allow you to have this kind of vibrant economy\n\n1:04:53.760 --> 1:04:55.600\n that operates not on the blockchain,\n\n1:04:55.600 --> 1:04:56.720\n but outside the blockchain.\n\n1:04:56.720 --> 1:05:00.800\n And you use this, uh, Bitcoin for, uh, for like\n\n1:05:00.800 --> 1:05:02.640\n checking the security of those transactions.\n\n1:05:02.640 --> 1:05:03.760\n So Bitcoin's not new.\n\n1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:05.280\n It's been around for a while.\n\n1:05:05.280 --> 1:05:07.440\n I've been watching it closely.\n\n1:05:07.440 --> 1:05:11.040\n I've not, I've not seen one example of it\n\n1:05:11.040 --> 1:05:12.240\n creating economic growth.\n\n1:05:12.880 --> 1:05:14.320\n There was this obsession with the idea\n\n1:05:14.320 --> 1:05:16.080\n that government was the problem,\n\n1:05:16.080 --> 1:05:18.400\n that idea that government's the problem.\n\n1:05:18.400 --> 1:05:21.920\n Let's say government earned that wrath, honestly,\n\n1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:25.040\n because if you look at some of the things\n\n1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:27.040\n that governments have done in recent decades,\n\n1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:28.960\n it's not a pretty story.\n\n1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:32.960\n Like, uh, after, uh, after a very small number\n\n1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:35.920\n of people in the US government decided to bomb\n\n1:05:35.920 --> 1:05:40.080\n in landmine Southeast Asia, it's hard to come back\n\n1:05:40.080 --> 1:05:41.760\n and say, oh, government's this great thing.\n\n1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:47.120\n But, uh, then the problem is that this resistance\n\n1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:50.880\n to government is basically resistance to politics.\n\n1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:53.120\n It's a way of saying, if I can get rich,\n\n1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:54.240\n nobody should bother me.\n\n1:05:54.240 --> 1:05:56.880\n It's a way of not, of not having obligations to others.\n\n1:05:56.880 --> 1:06:00.400\n And that ultimately is a very suspect motivation.\n\n1:06:00.400 --> 1:06:06.560\n But does that mean that the impulse that the government, um,\n\n1:06:06.560 --> 1:06:09.280\n should not overreach its power is flawed?\n\n1:06:09.280 --> 1:06:12.080\n Well, I mean, what I want to ask you to do\n\n1:06:12.080 --> 1:06:14.640\n is to replace the word government with politics.\n\n1:06:15.520 --> 1:06:19.200\n Like our politics is people having to deal with each other.\n\n1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:23.760\n My theory about freedom is that the only authentic form\n\n1:06:23.760 --> 1:06:25.600\n of freedom is perpetual annoyance.\n\n1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:27.120\n All right.\n\n1:06:27.120 --> 1:06:30.560\n So annoyance means you're actually dealing with people\n\n1:06:30.560 --> 1:06:31.760\n because people are annoying.\n\n1:06:31.760 --> 1:06:34.480\n Perpetual means that that annoyance is survivable\n\n1:06:34.480 --> 1:06:36.080\n so it doesn't destroy us all.\n\n1:06:36.080 --> 1:06:37.600\n So if you have perpetual annoyance,\n\n1:06:37.600 --> 1:06:38.400\n then you have freedom.\n\n1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:39.680\n And that's politics.\n\n1:06:39.680 --> 1:06:40.560\n That's politics.\n\n1:06:40.560 --> 1:06:42.160\n If you don't have perpetual annoyance,\n\n1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:45.440\n something's gone very wrong and you've suppressed those people\n\n1:06:45.440 --> 1:06:46.400\n that it's only temporary.\n\n1:06:46.400 --> 1:06:47.680\n It's going to come back and be horrible.\n\n1:06:48.400 --> 1:06:50.880\n You should seek perpetual annoyance.\n\n1:06:50.880 --> 1:06:52.800\n I'll invite you to a Berkeley city council meeting\n\n1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:53.920\n so you can know what that feels like.\n\n1:06:53.920 --> 1:06:57.280\n What perpetual annoyance feels like.\n\n1:06:57.280 --> 1:06:59.120\n But anyway, so freedom is being...\n\n1:06:59.840 --> 1:07:02.080\n The test of freedom is that you're annoyed by other people.\n\n1:07:02.080 --> 1:07:03.440\n If you're not, you're not free.\n\n1:07:03.440 --> 1:07:06.000\n If you're not, you're trapped in some temporary illusion\n\n1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:06.960\n that's going to fall apart.\n\n1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:10.400\n Now, this quest to avoid government\n\n1:07:10.400 --> 1:07:12.880\n is really a quest to avoid that political feeling,\n\n1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:14.080\n but you have to have it.\n\n1:07:14.080 --> 1:07:15.280\n You have to deal with it.\n\n1:07:16.480 --> 1:07:19.200\n And it sucks, but that's the human situation.\n\n1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:20.560\n That's the human condition.\n\n1:07:20.560 --> 1:07:22.800\n And this idea that we're going to have this abstract thing\n\n1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:25.200\n that protects us from having to deal with each other\n\n1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:26.640\n is always an illusion.\n\n1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:28.560\n The idea, and I apologize,\n\n1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:31.680\n I overstretched the use of the word government.\n\n1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:36.480\n The idea is there should be some punishment from the people\n\n1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:40.960\n when a bureaucracy, when a set of people\n\n1:07:40.960 --> 1:07:44.400\n or a particular leader, like in an authoritarian regime,\n\n1:07:44.400 --> 1:07:47.040\n which more than half the world currently lives under,\n\n1:07:47.040 --> 1:07:53.680\n if they become, they stop representing the people,\n\n1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:56.560\n it stops being like a Berkeley meeting\n\n1:07:56.560 --> 1:08:01.520\n and starts being more like a dictatorial kind of situation.\n\n1:08:01.520 --> 1:08:04.800\n And so the point is, it's nice to give people,\n\n1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:08.080\n the populace in a decentralized way,\n\n1:08:08.880 --> 1:08:15.360\n power to resist that kind of government becoming over authoritarian.\n\n1:08:15.360 --> 1:08:18.160\n Yeah, but people see this idea that the problem\n\n1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:20.320\n is always the government being powerful is false.\n\n1:08:21.360 --> 1:08:23.440\n The problem can also be criminal gangs.\n\n1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:25.440\n The problem can also be weird cults.\n\n1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:30.320\n The problem can be abusive clergy.\n\n1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:35.040\n The problem can be infrastructure that fails.\n\n1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:37.440\n The problem can be poisoned water.\n\n1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:39.760\n The problem can be failed electric grids.\n\n1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:45.440\n The problem can be a crappy education system\n\n1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:51.120\n that makes the whole society less and less able to create value.\n\n1:08:51.120 --> 1:08:52.640\n There are all these other problems\n\n1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:54.480\n that are different from an overbearing government.\n\n1:08:54.480 --> 1:08:56.800\n Like you have to keep some sense of perspective\n\n1:08:56.800 --> 1:08:59.120\n and not be obsessed with only one kind of problem\n\n1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:01.040\n because then the others will pop up.\n\n1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:05.120\n But empirically speaking, some problems are bigger than others.\n\n1:09:05.120 --> 1:09:08.720\n So like some groups of people,\n\n1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:12.080\n like governments or gangs or companies lead to problems.\n\n1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:13.520\n Are you a US citizen?\n\n1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:14.080\n Yes.\n\n1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:16.480\n Has the government ever really been a problem for you?\n\n1:09:16.480 --> 1:09:17.200\n Well, okay.\n\n1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:18.800\n So first of all, I grew up in the Soviet Union.\n\n1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:21.440\n Yeah, my wife did too.\n\n1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:28.800\n So I have seen, and has the government bothered me?\n\n1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:32.720\n I would say that that's a really complicated question,\n\n1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:34.720\n especially because the United States is such,\n\n1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:39.440\n it's a special place like a lot of other countries.\n\n1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:41.680\n My wife's family were refused NICs.\n\n1:09:41.680 --> 1:09:43.040\n And so we have like a very,\n\n1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:45.200\n and her dad was sent to the Gulag.\n\n1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:49.120\n For what it's worth on my father's side,\n\n1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:51.360\n all but a few were killed by a pogrom\n\n1:09:51.360 --> 1:09:55.920\n in a post Soviet pogrom in Ukraine.\n\n1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:00.000\n So I would say because you did a little trick\n\n1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:02.720\n of eloquent trick of language\n\n1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:04.640\n that you switched to the United States\n\n1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:06.160\n to talk about government.\n\n1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:09.840\n So I believe unlike my friend,\n\n1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:11.920\n Michael Malus, who's an anarchist,\n\n1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:15.600\n I believe government can do a lot of good in the world.\n\n1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:16.960\n That is exactly what you're saying,\n\n1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:19.680\n which is it's politics.\n\n1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:22.800\n The thing that Bitcoin folks and cryptocurrency folks argue\n\n1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:25.520\n is that one of the big ways that government\n\n1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:27.600\n can control the populace is centralized bank,\n\n1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:29.920\n like control the money.\n\n1:10:29.920 --> 1:10:32.160\n That was the case in the Soviet Union too.\n\n1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:37.160\n There's inflation can really make poor people suffer.\n\n1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:43.480\n And so what they argue is this is one way to go around\n\n1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:46.160\n that power that government has\n\n1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:48.400\n of controlling the monetary system.\n\n1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:50.080\n So that's a way to resist.\n\n1:10:50.080 --> 1:10:53.280\n That's not actually saying government bad.\n\n1:10:53.280 --> 1:10:55.520\n That's saying some of the ways\n\n1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:59.600\n that central banks get into trouble\n\n1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:01.120\n can be resisted through centralized.\n\n1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:04.960\n So let me ask you on balance today in the real world\n\n1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:07.520\n in terms of actual facts,\n\n1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:10.000\n do you think cryptocurrencies are doing more\n\n1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.840\n to prop up corrupt, murderous, horrible regimes\n\n1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:15.600\n or to resist those regimes?\n\n1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:17.440\n Where do you think the balance is right now?\n\n1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:21.360\n I know exactly having talked to a lot of cryptocurrency folks\n\n1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:22.720\n what they would tell me, right?\n\n1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:27.440\n I, it's hard, it's, I don't, no, no.\n\n1:11:27.440 --> 1:11:29.200\n I'm asking it as a real question.\n\n1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:30.720\n There's no way to know the answer perfectly.\n\n1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:32.640\n There's no way to know the answer perfectly.\n\n1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:36.400\n However, I gotta say, if you look at people\n\n1:11:36.400 --> 1:11:39.680\n who've been able to decode blockchains\n\n1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:41.040\n and they do leak a lot of data.\n\n1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:42.960\n They're not as secure as this widely thought.\n\n1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:47.200\n There are a lot of unknown Bitcoin whales\n\n1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:49.760\n from pretty early and they're huge.\n\n1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:53.280\n And if you ask, who are these people?\n\n1:11:54.880 --> 1:11:57.600\n There's evidence that a lot of them are quite\n\n1:11:57.600 --> 1:12:00.240\n not the people you'd wanna support, let's say.\n\n1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:03.760\n And I just don't, like, I think empirically\n\n1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:07.200\n this idea that there's some intrinsic way\n\n1:12:07.200 --> 1:12:12.200\n that bad governments will be disempowered\n\n1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:16.000\n and people will be able to resist them more\n\n1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.800\n than new villains or even villainous governments\n\n1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:19.600\n will be empowered.\n\n1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:21.840\n There's no basis for that assertion.\n\n1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:23.840\n It just is kind of circumstantial.\n\n1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:30.560\n And I think in general, Bitcoin ownership is one thing,\n\n1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:32.960\n but Bitcoin transactions have tended\n\n1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:36.640\n to support criminality more than productivity.\n\n1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:38.960\n Of course, they would argue that was the story\n\n1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:42.480\n of its early days, that now more and more Bitcoin\n\n1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:46.240\n is being used for legitimate transactions, but...\n\n1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:47.040\n That's the difference.\n\n1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:48.560\n I didn't say for legitimate transactions.\n\n1:12:48.560 --> 1:12:51.440\n I said for economic growth, for creativity.\n\n1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:56.400\n Like, I think what's happening is people are using it\n\n1:12:56.400 --> 1:12:58.720\n a little bit for buying, I don't know,\n\n1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:02.160\n maybe some of these companies make it available\n\n1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:04.480\n for this and that, they buy a Tesla with it or something.\n\n1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:10.480\n Investing in a startup hard, it might've happened\n\n1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:13.360\n a little bit, but it's not an engine of productivity,\n\n1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:14.720\n creativity, and economic growth,\n\n1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:17.840\n whereas old fashioned currency still is.\n\n1:13:17.840 --> 1:13:23.040\n And anyway, look, I think something...\n\n1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:26.560\n I'm pro the idea of digital currencies.\n\n1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:36.160\n I am anti the idea of economics wiping out politics\n\n1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:36.960\n as a result.\n\n1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:39.840\n I think they have to exist in some balance\n\n1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:41.600\n to avoid the worst dysfunctions of each.\n\n1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:44.640\n In some ways, there's parallels to our discussion\n\n1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:50.720\n of algorithms and cryptocurrency is you're pro the idea,\n\n1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:54.240\n but it can be used to manipulate,\n\n1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:58.640\n you can be used poorly by aforementioned humans.\n\n1:13:59.200 --> 1:14:02.000\n Well, I think that you can make better designs\n\n1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:02.960\n and worse designs.\n\n1:14:04.400 --> 1:14:07.120\n And the thing about cryptocurrency that's so interesting\n\n1:14:07.680 --> 1:14:12.560\n is how many of us are responsible for the poor designs\n\n1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:16.720\n because we're all so hooked on that Horatio Alger story\n\n1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:19.520\n on like, I'm gonna be the one who gets the viral benefit.\n\n1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:22.720\n Way back when all this stuff was starting,\n\n1:14:22.720 --> 1:14:24.720\n I remember it would have been in the 80s,\n\n1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:26.640\n somebody had the idea of using viral\n\n1:14:26.640 --> 1:14:28.800\n as a metaphor for network effect.\n\n1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:32.160\n And the whole point was to talk about\n\n1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:33.520\n how bad network effect was,\n\n1:14:33.520 --> 1:14:35.760\n that it always created distortions\n\n1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:39.200\n that ruined the usefulness of economic incentives\n\n1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:42.400\n that created dangerous distortions.\n\n1:14:42.400 --> 1:14:45.440\n Like, but then somehow, even after the pandemic,\n\n1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:46.960\n we think of viral as this good thing\n\n1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:49.200\n because we imagine ourselves as the virus, right?\n\n1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:52.000\n We wanna be on the beneficiary side of it.\n\n1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:53.600\n But of course, you're not likely to be.\n\n1:14:54.480 --> 1:14:56.880\n There is a sense because money is involved,\n\n1:14:56.880 --> 1:15:01.440\n people are not reasoning clearly always\n\n1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:06.400\n because they want to be part of that first viral wave\n\n1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:07.520\n that makes them rich.\n\n1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:11.200\n And that blinds people from their basic morality.\n\n1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:13.200\n I had an interesting conversation.\n\n1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:16.400\n I sort of feel like I should respect some people's privacy,\n\n1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:20.720\n but some of the initial people who started Bitcoin,\n\n1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:23.120\n I remember having an argument about like,\n\n1:15:24.320 --> 1:15:26.400\n it's intrinsically a Ponzi scheme,\n\n1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:29.520\n like the early people have more than the later people.\n\n1:15:29.520 --> 1:15:31.680\n And the further down the chain you get,\n\n1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:34.800\n the more you're subject to gambling like dynamics\n\n1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:36.000\n where it's more and more random\n\n1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:37.760\n and more and more subject to weird network effects\n\n1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:41.280\n and whatnot unless you're a very small player perhaps\n\n1:15:41.280 --> 1:15:42.880\n and you're just buying something,\n\n1:15:42.880 --> 1:15:45.120\n but even then you'll be subject to fluctuations\n\n1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:46.560\n because the whole thing is just kind of,\n\n1:15:48.080 --> 1:15:48.960\n as it fluctuates,\n\n1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:51.680\n it's gonna wave around the little people more.\n\n1:15:51.680 --> 1:15:55.200\n And I remember the conversation turned to gambling\n\n1:15:55.200 --> 1:15:57.520\n because gambling is a pretty large economic sector.\n\n1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:01.440\n And it's always struck me as being nonproductive.\n\n1:16:01.440 --> 1:16:03.680\n Like somebody goes to Las Vegas and they lose money.\n\n1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:06.880\n And so one argument is, well, they got entertainment.\n\n1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:08.960\n They paid for entertainment as they lost money.\n\n1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:10.320\n So that's fine.\n\n1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:13.360\n And Las Vegas does up the losing of money\n\n1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:14.160\n in an entertaining way.\n\n1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:14.720\n So why not?\n\n1:16:14.720 --> 1:16:15.920\n It's like going to a show.\n\n1:16:15.920 --> 1:16:16.880\n So that's one argument.\n\n1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:19.680\n The argument that was made to me was different from that.\n\n1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:21.200\n It's that, no, what they're doing\n\n1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:23.680\n is they're getting a chance to experience hope.\n\n1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:25.360\n And a lot of people don't get that chance.\n\n1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:26.560\n And so that's really worth it.\n\n1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:27.440\n Even if they're gonna lose,\n\n1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:28.960\n they have that moment of hope\n\n1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:30.560\n and they need to be able to experience that.\n\n1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:33.600\n And it was a very interesting argument.\n\n1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:38.720\n That's so heartbreaking, but I've seen that.\n\n1:16:39.920 --> 1:16:41.600\n I have that a little bit of a sense.\n\n1:16:41.600 --> 1:16:43.040\n I've talked to some young people\n\n1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:44.960\n who invest in cryptocurrency.\n\n1:16:45.840 --> 1:16:48.320\n And what I see is this hope.\n\n1:16:48.320 --> 1:16:50.240\n This is the first thing that gave them hope.\n\n1:16:50.240 --> 1:16:51.680\n And that's so heartbreaking to me\n\n1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:55.440\n that you've gotten hope from that.\n\n1:16:55.440 --> 1:16:56.720\n So much is invested.\n\n1:16:56.720 --> 1:16:59.840\n It's like hope from somehow becoming rich\n\n1:16:59.840 --> 1:17:01.520\n as opposed to something to me.\n\n1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:04.960\n I apologize, but money is in the longterm\n\n1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:07.760\n not going to be a source of that deep meaning.\n\n1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:09.040\n It's good to have enough money,\n\n1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:11.200\n but it should not be the source of hope.\n\n1:17:11.920 --> 1:17:13.040\n And it's heartbreaking to me\n\n1:17:13.040 --> 1:17:14.800\n how many people is the source of hope.\n\n1:17:16.160 --> 1:17:21.200\n Yeah, you've just described the psychology of virality\n\n1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:25.600\n or the psychology of trying to base a civilization\n\n1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:28.640\n on semi random occurrences of network effect peaks.\n\n1:17:28.640 --> 1:17:31.680\n Yeah, and it doesn't really work.\n\n1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:33.600\n I mean, I think we need to get away from that.\n\n1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:35.360\n We need to soften those peaks\n\n1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:39.840\n and accept Microsoft, which deserves every penny,\n\n1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:41.280\n but in every other case.\n\n1:17:41.280 --> 1:17:42.320\n Well, you mentioned GitHub.\n\n1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:45.600\n I think what Microsoft did with GitHub was brilliant.\n\n1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:47.120\n I was very happy.\n\n1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:50.560\n Okay, if I can give a, not a critical,\n\n1:17:50.560 --> 1:17:55.920\n but on Microsoft because they recently purchased Bethesda.\n\n1:17:56.480 --> 1:17:58.400\n So Elder Scrolls is in their hands.\n\n1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:01.200\n I'm watching you, Microsoft,\n\n1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:02.720\n do not screw up my favorite game.\n\n1:18:03.840 --> 1:18:06.880\n Yeah, well, look, I'm not speaking for Microsoft.\n\n1:18:06.880 --> 1:18:08.960\n I have an explicit arrangement with them\n\n1:18:08.960 --> 1:18:11.120\n where I don't speak for them, obviously,\n\n1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:12.080\n like that should be very clear.\n\n1:18:12.080 --> 1:18:13.120\n I do not speak for them.\n\n1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:17.280\n I am not saying I like them.\n\n1:18:17.280 --> 1:18:18.960\n I think such is amazing.\n\n1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:22.720\n The term data dignity was coined by Sacha.\n\n1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:27.040\n Like, so, you know, we have, it's kind of extraordinary,\n\n1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:29.280\n but, you know, Microsoft's this giant thing.\n\n1:18:29.280 --> 1:18:30.560\n It's going to screw up this or that.\n\n1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:33.440\n You know, it's not, I don't know.\n\n1:18:33.440 --> 1:18:34.880\n It's kind of interesting.\n\n1:18:34.880 --> 1:18:36.720\n I've had a few occasions in my life\n\n1:18:36.720 --> 1:18:39.760\n to see how things work from the inside of some big thing.\n\n1:18:39.760 --> 1:18:41.680\n And, you know, it's always just people kind of,\n\n1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:47.520\n I don't know, there's always like coordination problems.\n\n1:18:48.720 --> 1:18:50.480\n There's always human problems.\n\n1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:51.600\n Oh God, there's some good people.\n\n1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:52.560\n There's some bad people.\n\n1:18:52.560 --> 1:18:55.120\n It's always, I hope Microsoft doesn't screw up your game.\n\n1:18:55.120 --> 1:18:57.760\n And I hope they bring Clippy back.\n\n1:18:57.760 --> 1:18:59.360\n You should never kill Clippy.\n\n1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:00.080\n Bring Clippy back.\n\n1:19:00.080 --> 1:19:01.120\n Oh, Clippy.\n\n1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:03.120\n But Clippy promotes the myth of AI.\n\n1:19:03.840 --> 1:19:06.240\n Well, that's why, this is why I think you're wrong.\n\n1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:07.840\n How about if we, all right.\n\n1:19:07.840 --> 1:19:10.000\n Could we bring back Bob instead of Clippy?\n\n1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:11.040\n Which one was Bob?\n\n1:19:11.040 --> 1:19:13.040\n Oh, Bob was another thing.\n\n1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:15.040\n Bob was this other screen character\n\n1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:16.720\n who was supposed to be the voice of AI.\n\n1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:17.440\n Cortana?\n\n1:19:17.440 --> 1:19:17.920\n Cortana?\n\n1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:19.200\n Would Cortana do it for you?\n\n1:19:19.200 --> 1:19:20.640\n Cortana is too corporate.\n\n1:19:20.640 --> 1:19:23.680\n I like it, Cortana's fine.\n\n1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:27.440\n There's a woman in Seattle who's like the model for Cortana,\n\n1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:28.400\n did Cortana's voice.\n\n1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:29.120\n The voice?\n\n1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:29.760\n There was like,\n\n1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:30.800\n No, the voice is great.\n\n1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:34.560\n We had her as a, she used to walk around\n\n1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:36.160\n if you were wearing Hollands for a bit.\n\n1:19:36.160 --> 1:19:37.440\n I don't think that's happening anymore.\n\n1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:40.160\n I think, I don't think you should turn a software\n\n1:19:40.160 --> 1:19:41.040\n into a creature.\n\n1:19:41.040 --> 1:19:42.080\n Well, you and I,\n\n1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:43.280\n Get a cat, just get a cat.\n\n1:19:43.280 --> 1:19:44.320\n You and I, you and I.\n\n1:19:44.320 --> 1:19:45.840\n Well, get a dog.\n\n1:19:45.840 --> 1:19:46.320\n Get a dog.\n\n1:19:46.320 --> 1:19:47.200\n Or a dog, yeah.\n\n1:19:47.840 --> 1:19:48.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:49.680\n Or a hedgehog.\n\n1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:50.640\n A hedgehog.\n\n1:19:50.640 --> 1:19:50.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:55.280\n You coauthored a paper, you mentioned Lee Smolin,\n\n1:19:56.320 --> 1:19:59.120\n titled The Autodidactic Universe,\n\n1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:03.760\n which describes our universe as one that learns its own physical laws.\n\n1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:08.720\n That's a trippy and beautiful and powerful idea.\n\n1:20:09.520 --> 1:20:12.560\n What are, what would you say are the key ideas in this paper?\n\n1:20:12.560 --> 1:20:13.680\n Ah, okay.\n\n1:20:13.680 --> 1:20:18.640\n Well, I should say that paper reflected work from last year\n\n1:20:18.640 --> 1:20:21.440\n and the project, the program has moved quite a lot.\n\n1:20:21.440 --> 1:20:24.080\n So it's a little, there's a lot of stuff that's not published\n\n1:20:24.080 --> 1:20:25.200\n that I'm quite excited about.\n\n1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:28.560\n So I have to kind of keep my frame in that,\n\n1:20:28.560 --> 1:20:30.160\n in that last year's thing.\n\n1:20:30.160 --> 1:20:31.920\n So I have to try to be a little careful about that.\n\n1:20:33.760 --> 1:20:35.520\n We can think about it in a few different ways.\n\n1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:40.640\n The core of the paper, the technical core of it\n\n1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:42.400\n is a triple correspondence.\n\n1:20:43.760 --> 1:20:46.960\n One part of it was already established\n\n1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:49.600\n and then another part is in the process.\n\n1:20:49.600 --> 1:20:53.040\n The part that was established was, of course,\n\n1:20:53.040 --> 1:20:57.040\n understanding different theories of physics as matrix models.\n\n1:20:57.040 --> 1:21:01.600\n The part that was fresher is understanding those\n\n1:21:01.600 --> 1:21:04.800\n as machine learning systems so that we could move fluidly\n\n1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:07.440\n between these different ways of describing systems.\n\n1:21:07.440 --> 1:21:11.680\n And the reason to want to do that is to just have more tools\n\n1:21:11.680 --> 1:21:15.920\n and more options because, well,\n\n1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:17.520\n theoretical physics is really hard\n\n1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:22.520\n and a lot of programs have kind of run into a state\n\n1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:25.120\n where they feel a little stalled, I guess.\n\n1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:26.720\n I want to be delicate about this\n\n1:21:26.720 --> 1:21:27.680\n because I'm not a physicist,\n\n1:21:27.680 --> 1:21:29.600\n I'm the computer scientist collaborating.\n\n1:21:29.600 --> 1:21:32.080\n So I don't mean to diss anybody's.\n\n1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:34.560\n So this is almost like gives a framework\n\n1:21:34.560 --> 1:21:36.400\n for generating new ideas in physics.\n\n1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:40.000\n As we start to publish more about where it's gone,\n\n1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:42.800\n I think you'll start to see there's tools\n\n1:21:42.800 --> 1:21:45.840\n and ways of thinking about theories\n\n1:21:45.840 --> 1:21:49.520\n that I think open up some new paths\n\n1:21:49.520 --> 1:21:51.600\n that will be of interest.\n\n1:21:52.800 --> 1:21:54.320\n There's the technical core of it,\n\n1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:56.720\n which is this idea of a correspondence\n\n1:21:56.720 --> 1:21:58.080\n to give you more facility.\n\n1:21:58.080 --> 1:22:00.720\n But then there's also the storytelling part of it.\n\n1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:05.920\n And this is something Lee loves stories and I do.\n\n1:22:05.920 --> 1:22:13.760\n And the idea here is that a typical way\n\n1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:17.040\n of thinking about physics is that there's some kind\n\n1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:19.360\n of starting condition and then there's some principle\n\n1:22:19.360 --> 1:22:22.240\n by which the starting condition evolves.\n\n1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:26.240\n And the question is like, why the starting condition?\n\n1:22:28.640 --> 1:22:32.400\n The starting condition has to be fine tuned\n\n1:22:32.400 --> 1:22:35.760\n and all these things about it have to be kind of perfect.\n\n1:22:35.760 --> 1:22:37.360\n And so we were thinking, well, look,\n\n1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:40.720\n what if we could push the storytelling\n\n1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:42.960\n about where the universe comes from much further back\n\n1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:46.080\n by starting with really simple things that evolve\n\n1:22:46.080 --> 1:22:47.280\n and then through that evolution,\n\n1:22:47.280 --> 1:22:48.880\n explain how things got to be how they are\n\n1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:51.200\n through very simple principles, right?\n\n1:22:51.200 --> 1:22:55.120\n And so we've been exploring a variety of ways\n\n1:22:55.120 --> 1:22:57.680\n to push the start of the storytelling\n\n1:22:57.680 --> 1:22:58.800\n further and further back,\n\n1:23:00.400 --> 1:23:03.600\n and it's really kind of interesting\n\n1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:07.040\n because like for all of his,\n\n1:23:07.040 --> 1:23:09.200\n Lee is sometimes considered to be,\n\n1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:13.840\n to have a radical quality in the physics world.\n\n1:23:13.840 --> 1:23:18.240\n But he still is like, no, this is gonna be like,\n\n1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:19.760\n the kind of time we're talking about\n\n1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:22.320\n in which evolution happens is the same time we're now\n\n1:23:22.320 --> 1:23:25.680\n and we're talking about something that starts and continues.\n\n1:23:25.680 --> 1:23:27.760\n And I'm like, well, what if there's some other kind\n\n1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:31.040\n of time that's time like, and it sounds like metaphysics,\n\n1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:33.520\n but there's an ambiguity, you know, like,\n\n1:23:34.560 --> 1:23:36.160\n it has to start from something\n\n1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:37.920\n and it's kind of interesting.\n\n1:23:37.920 --> 1:23:41.440\n So there's this, a lot of the math\n\n1:23:41.440 --> 1:23:44.000\n can be thought of either way, which is kind of interesting.\n\n1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.000\n So push this so far back that basically\n\n1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:47.920\n all the things that we take for granted in physics\n\n1:23:47.920 --> 1:23:50.960\n start becoming emergent, it's emergent.\n\n1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:53.440\n I really wanna emphasize this is all super baby steps.\n\n1:23:53.440 --> 1:23:54.480\n I don't wanna over claim.\n\n1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:57.440\n It's like, I think a lot of the things we're doing,\n\n1:23:57.440 --> 1:23:59.040\n we're approaching some old problems\n\n1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:01.280\n in a pretty fresh way, informed.\n\n1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:04.640\n There's been a zillion papers about how you can think\n\n1:24:04.640 --> 1:24:06.160\n of the universe as a big neural net\n\n1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:09.120\n or how you can think of different ideas in physics\n\n1:24:09.120 --> 1:24:11.680\n as being quite similar to, or even equivalent\n\n1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:13.840\n to some of the ideas in machine learning.\n\n1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:18.720\n And that actually works out crazy well.\n\n1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:21.040\n Like, I mean, that is actually kind of eerie\n\n1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:24.080\n when you look at it, like there's probably\n\n1:24:24.800 --> 1:24:26.800\n two or three dozen papers that have this quality\n\n1:24:26.800 --> 1:24:28.480\n and some of them are just crazy good.\n\n1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:30.480\n And it's very interesting.\n\n1:24:30.480 --> 1:24:33.200\n What we're trying to do is take those kinds\n\n1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:35.760\n of observations and turn them into an actionable framework\n\n1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:38.640\n where you can then start to do things\n\n1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:40.480\n with landscapes or theories that you couldn't do before\n\n1:24:40.480 --> 1:24:41.280\n and that sort of thing.\n\n1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:46.000\n So in that context, or maybe beyond,\n\n1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:47.360\n how do you explain us humans?\n\n1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:50.960\n How unlikely are we, this intelligent civilization\n\n1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:54.800\n or is there a lot of others or are we alone in this universe?\n\n1:24:54.800 --> 1:24:57.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:57.520 --> 1:25:01.760\n You seem to appreciate humans very much.\n\n1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:04.560\n I've grown fond of us.\n\n1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:06.800\n We're okay.\n\n1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:10.720\n We have our nice qualities.\n\n1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:14.560\n I like that.\n\n1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:16.240\n I mean, we're kind of weird.\n\n1:25:16.240 --> 1:25:18.160\n We sprout this hair on our heads and then we're,\n\n1:25:18.160 --> 1:25:20.240\n I don't know, we're sort of weird animals.\n\n1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:21.840\n That's the feature, not a bug, I think.\n\n1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:23.120\n The weirdness.\n\n1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:24.320\n I hope so.\n\n1:25:24.320 --> 1:25:25.040\n I hope so.\n\n1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:35.360\n I think if I'm just going to answer you in terms of truth,\n\n1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:39.040\n the first thing I'd say is we're not in a privileged enough\n\n1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:44.720\n position, at least as yet, to really know much about who we\n\n1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:48.320\n are, how we are, what we're really like in the context\n\n1:25:48.320 --> 1:25:50.640\n of something larger, what that context is,\n\n1:25:50.640 --> 1:25:51.440\n like all that stuff.\n\n1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:52.880\n We might learn more in the future.\n\n1:25:52.880 --> 1:25:55.200\n Our descendants might learn more, but we don't really know\n\n1:25:55.200 --> 1:25:59.440\n very much, which you can either view as frustrating or charming\n\n1:25:59.440 --> 1:26:01.200\n like that first year of TikTok or something.\n\n1:26:03.200 --> 1:26:04.960\n All roads lead back to TikTok.\n\n1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:05.520\n I like it.\n\n1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:06.160\n Well, lately.\n\n1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:10.240\n But in terms of, there's another level at which I can think\n\n1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:19.840\n about it where I sometimes think that if you are just quiet\n\n1:26:19.840 --> 1:26:22.640\n and you do something that gets you in touch with the way\n\n1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:27.440\n reality happens, and for me it's playing music, sometimes it\n\n1:26:27.440 --> 1:26:30.880\n seems like you can feel a bit of how the universe is.\n\n1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:34.240\n And it feels like there's a lot more going on in it and there\n\n1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:38.000\n is a lot more life and a lot more stuff happening and a lot\n\n1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:39.120\n more stuff flowing through it.\n\n1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:40.800\n I'm not speaking as a scientist now.\n\n1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:46.560\n This is kind of a more my artist side talking and I feel like\n\n1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:50.960\n I'm suddenly in multiple personalities with you.\n\n1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:56.160\n Jack Kerouac said that music is the only truth.\n\n1:26:57.520 --> 1:27:01.360\n It sounds like you might be at least in part.\n\n1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:04.560\n There's a passage in Kerouac's book, Dr.\n\n1:27:04.560 --> 1:27:07.360\n Sacks, where somebody tries to just explain the whole\n\n1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:10.000\n situation with reality and people in like a paragraph.\n\n1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:13.200\n And I couldn't reproduce it for you here, but it's like, yeah,\n\n1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:15.520\n like there are these bulbous things that walk around and\n\n1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:17.680\n they make these sounds, you can sort of understand them, but\n\n1:27:17.680 --> 1:27:19.600\n only kind of, and then there's like this, and it's just like\n\n1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:24.240\n this amazing, like just really quick, like if some spirit\n\n1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:26.400\n being or something was going to show up in our reality and\n\n1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:29.120\n hadn't knew nothing about it, it's like a little basic intro\n\n1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:30.400\n of like, okay, here's what's going on here.\n\n1:27:30.400 --> 1:27:32.400\n It's an incredible passage.\n\n1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:32.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:33.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:33.760 --> 1:27:36.800\n It's like a one or two sentence summary in H.\n\n1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:38.880\n Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, right?\n\n1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:40.160\n Of what this...\n\n1:27:40.160 --> 1:27:41.280\n Mostly harmless.\n\n1:27:41.280 --> 1:27:42.880\n Mostly harmless.\n\n1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:45.760\n Do you think there's truth to that, that music somehow\n\n1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:47.920\n connects to something that words cannot?\n\n1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:49.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:52.560\n Music is something that just towers above me.\n\n1:27:52.560 --> 1:27:57.680\n I don't feel like I have an overview of it.\n\n1:27:57.680 --> 1:27:58.640\n It's just the reverse.\n\n1:27:58.640 --> 1:28:02.080\n I don't fully understand it because on one level it's simple.\n\n1:28:02.080 --> 1:28:06.160\n Like you can say, oh, it's a thing people evolved to\n\n1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:11.760\n coordinate our brains on a pattern level or something like that.\n\n1:28:11.760 --> 1:28:14.240\n There's all these things you can say about music, which are,\n\n1:28:14.240 --> 1:28:15.920\n you know, some of that's probably true.\n\n1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:25.520\n It's also, there's kind of like this, this is the mystery of\n\n1:28:25.520 --> 1:28:26.000\n meaning.\n\n1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:30.400\n Like there's a way that just instead of just being pure\n\n1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:34.160\n abstraction, music can have like this kind of substantiality\n\n1:28:34.160 --> 1:28:37.600\n to it that is philosophically impossible.\n\n1:28:39.760 --> 1:28:41.120\n I don't know what to do with it.\n\n1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:41.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:45.520\n The amount of understanding I feel I have when I hear the\n\n1:28:45.520 --> 1:28:51.120\n right song at the right time is not comparable to anything I\n\n1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:52.320\n can read on Wikipedia.\n\n1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:57.200\n Anything I can understand, read through in language.\n\n1:28:57.200 --> 1:28:59.520\n The music does connect us to something.\n\n1:28:59.520 --> 1:29:00.720\n There's this thing there.\n\n1:29:00.720 --> 1:29:04.800\n Yeah, there's some kind of a thing in it.\n\n1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:09.760\n And I've never ever, I've read across a lot of explanations\n\n1:29:09.760 --> 1:29:13.440\n from all kinds of interesting people like that it's some kind\n\n1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:18.160\n of a flow language between people or between people and how\n\n1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:19.680\n they perceive and that kind of thing.\n\n1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:26.000\n And that sort of explanation is fine, but it's not quite it\n\n1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:26.400\n either.\n\n1:29:26.400 --> 1:29:27.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:27.040 --> 1:29:31.360\n There's something about music that makes me believe that\n\n1:29:31.360 --> 1:29:35.520\n panpsychism could possibly be true, which is that everything\n\n1:29:35.520 --> 1:29:36.720\n in the universe is conscious.\n\n1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:43.520\n It makes me think, makes me be humble in how much or how\n\n1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:48.480\n little I understand about the functions of our universe that\n\n1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:49.680\n everything might be conscious.\n\n1:29:50.560 --> 1:29:54.640\n Most people interested in theoretical physics eventually\n\n1:29:54.640 --> 1:30:00.080\n land in panpsychism, but I'm not one of them.\n\n1:30:00.080 --> 1:30:08.080\n I still think there's this pragmatic imperative to treat\n\n1:30:08.080 --> 1:30:09.120\n people as special.\n\n1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:13.920\n So I will proudly be a dualist without people and cats.\n\n1:30:14.880 --> 1:30:19.600\n Yeah, I'm not quite sure where to draw the line or why the\n\n1:30:19.600 --> 1:30:21.120\n line's there or anything like that.\n\n1:30:21.120 --> 1:30:23.600\n But I don't think I should be required to all the same\n\n1:30:23.600 --> 1:30:25.920\n questions are equally mysterious for no line.\n\n1:30:25.920 --> 1:30:28.480\n So I don't feel disadvantaged by that.\n\n1:30:28.480 --> 1:30:30.320\n So I shall remain a dualist.\n\n1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:36.640\n But if you listen to anyone trying to explain where\n\n1:30:36.640 --> 1:30:39.520\n consciousness is in a dualistic sense, either believing in\n\n1:30:39.520 --> 1:30:42.400\n souls or some special thing in the brain or something, you\n\n1:30:42.400 --> 1:30:44.080\n pretty much say, screw this.\n\n1:30:44.080 --> 1:30:45.120\n I'm going to be a panpsychist.\n\n1:30:51.200 --> 1:30:52.000\n Fair enough.\n\n1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:52.480\n Well put.\n\n1:30:53.280 --> 1:30:56.320\n Is there moments in your life that happened that we're\n\n1:30:56.320 --> 1:31:00.160\n defining in the way that you hope others your daughter?\n\n1:31:00.160 --> 1:31:04.400\n Well, listen, I got to say the moments that defined me were\n\n1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:06.240\n not the good ones.\n\n1:31:06.240 --> 1:31:09.200\n The moments that defined me were often horrible.\n\n1:31:12.320 --> 1:31:16.720\n I've had successes, you know, but if you ask what defined\n\n1:31:16.720 --> 1:31:24.640\n me, my mother's death, being under the World Trade Center\n\n1:31:24.640 --> 1:31:30.720\n and the attack, the things that have had an effect on me\n\n1:31:30.720 --> 1:31:35.120\n were the most were sort of real world, terrible things,\n\n1:31:35.120 --> 1:31:37.360\n which I don't wish on young people at all.\n\n1:31:38.640 --> 1:31:42.080\n And this is the thing that's hard about giving advice to\n\n1:31:42.080 --> 1:31:47.120\n young people that they have to learn their own lessons.\n\n1:31:48.320 --> 1:31:52.000\n And lessons don't come easily.\n\n1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:56.560\n And a world which avoids hard lessons will be a stupid\n\n1:31:56.560 --> 1:31:59.200\n world, you know, and I don't know what to do with it.\n\n1:31:59.200 --> 1:32:03.440\n That's a little bundle of truth that has a bit of a fatalistic\n\n1:32:03.440 --> 1:32:07.040\n quality to it, but I don't\u2014this is like when I'm saying\n\n1:32:07.040 --> 1:32:08.960\n that, you know, freedom equals eternal annoyance.\n\n1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:14.560\n Like, you can't\u2014like, there's a degree to which honest\n\n1:32:14.560 --> 1:32:19.280\n advice is not that pleasant to give.\n\n1:32:19.280 --> 1:32:24.960\n And I don't want young people to have to know about\n\n1:32:24.960 --> 1:32:25.600\n everything.\n\n1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:27.920\n You don't want to wish hardship on them.\n\n1:32:27.920 --> 1:32:33.040\n Yeah, I think they deserve to have a little grace period\n\n1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:34.640\n of naivet\u00e9 that's pleasant.\n\n1:32:34.640 --> 1:32:40.240\n I mean, I do, you know, if it's possible, if it's\u2014these\n\n1:32:40.240 --> 1:32:42.400\n things are\u2014this is like\u2014this is tricky stuff.\n\n1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:50.000\n I mean, if you\u2014okay, so let me try a little bit on this\n\n1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:50.880\n advice thing.\n\n1:32:50.880 --> 1:32:55.680\n I think one thing\u2014and any serious, broad advice will\n\n1:32:55.680 --> 1:32:57.920\n have been given a thousand times before for a thousand\n\n1:32:57.920 --> 1:33:04.480\n years, so I'm not going to claim originality, but I think\n\n1:33:04.480 --> 1:33:11.600\n trying to find a way to really pay attention to what you're\n\n1:33:11.600 --> 1:33:14.720\n feeling fundamentally, what your sense of the world is, what\n\n1:33:14.720 --> 1:33:17.920\n your intuition is, if you feel like an intuitive person, what\n\n1:33:17.920 --> 1:33:27.120\n you're\u2014like, to try to escape the constant sway of social\n\n1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:30.400\n perception or manipulation, whatever you wish\u2014not to\n\n1:33:30.400 --> 1:33:35.120\n escape it entirely, that would be horrible, but to find cover\n\n1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:39.760\n from it once in a while, to find a sense of being anchored\n\n1:33:39.760 --> 1:33:44.000\n in that, to believe in experience as a real thing.\n\n1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:47.040\n Believing in experience as a real thing is very dualistic.\n\n1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:50.080\n That goes with my philosophy of dualism.\n\n1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:53.840\n I believe there's something magical, and instead of squirting\n\n1:33:53.840 --> 1:33:57.840\n the magic dust on the programs, I think experience is something\n\n1:33:57.840 --> 1:34:00.240\n real and something apart, something mystical and something\u2014\n\n1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:04.800\n Your own personal experience that you just have, and then\n\n1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:07.760\n you're saying silence the rest of the world enough to hear\n\n1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:11.280\n that\u2014like, whatever that magic dust is in that experience.\n\n1:34:11.280 --> 1:34:18.080\n Find what is there, and I think that's one thing.\n\n1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:24.720\n Another thing is to recognize that kindness requires genius,\n\n1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:29.120\n that it's actually really hard, that facile kindness is not\n\n1:34:29.120 --> 1:34:32.640\n kindness, and that it'll take you a while to have the skills\n\n1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:36.240\n to have kind impulses to want to be kind you can have right\n\n1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:39.280\n away. To be effectively kind is hard.\n\n1:34:39.280 --> 1:34:41.760\n To be effectively kind, yeah.\n\n1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:45.840\n It takes skill. It takes hard lessons.\n\n1:34:50.880 --> 1:34:55.120\n You'll never be perfect at it. To the degree you get anywhere\n\n1:34:55.120 --> 1:34:57.360\n with it, it's the most rewarding thing ever.\n\n1:35:01.040 --> 1:35:02.480\n Let's see, what else would I say?\n\n1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:10.000\n I would say when you're young, you can be very overwhelmed\n\n1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:19.920\n by social and interpersonal emotions. You'll have broken hearts and\n\n1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:24.880\n jealousies. You'll feel socially down the ladder instead of up the\n\n1:35:24.880 --> 1:35:28.720\n ladder. It feels horrible when that happens. All of these things.\n\n1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:34.720\n And you have to remember what a fragile crust all that stuff is,\n\n1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:38.720\n and it's hard because right when it's happening, it's just so intense.\n\n1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:48.880\n If I was actually giving this advice to my daughter, she'd already\n\n1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:55.760\n be out of the room. This is for some hypothetical teenager that\n\n1:35:55.760 --> 1:35:58.880\n doesn't really exist that really wants to sit and listen to my\n\n1:35:58.880 --> 1:36:02.080\n voice for your daughter 10 years from now. Maybe.\n\n1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:06.480\n Can I ask you a difficult question?\n\n1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:07.280\n Yeah, sure.\n\n1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:10.640\n You talked about losing your mom.\n\n1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:11.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:36:11.840 --> 1:36:13.600\n Do you miss her?\n\n1:36:14.960 --> 1:36:18.160\n Yeah, I mean, I still connected her through music. She was a\n\n1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:26.640\n a young prodigy piano player in Vienna, and she survived the\n\n1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:32.160\n concentration camp and then died in a car accident here in the US.\n\n1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:38.160\n What music makes you think of her? Is there a song that connects?\n\n1:36:38.160 --> 1:36:46.080\n Well, she was in Vienna, so she had the whole Viennese music thing\n\n1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:54.640\n going, which is this incredible school of absolute skill and\n\n1:36:54.640 --> 1:36:58.640\n romance bundled together and wonderful on the piano, especially.\n\n1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:01.920\n I learned to play some of the Beethoven sonatas for her, and I\n\n1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:05.440\n played them in this exaggerated, drippy way I remember when I was\n\n1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:05.940\n a kid.\n\n1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:09.440\n Exaggerated meaning too full of emotion?\n\n1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:10.320\n Yeah, just like...\n\n1:37:11.360 --> 1:37:14.000\n Isn't that the only way to play Beethoven? I mean, I didn't know\n\n1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:14.800\n there's any other way.\n\n1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:17.920\n That's a reasonable question. I mean, the fashion these days is to\n\n1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:22.800\n be slightly Apollonian even with Beethoven, but one imagines that\n\n1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:26.160\n actual Beethoven playing might have been different. I don't\n\n1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:31.040\n know. I've gotten to play a few instruments he played and tried\n\n1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:33.280\n to see if I could feel anything about how it might have been for\n\n1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:34.880\n him. I don't know, really.\n\n1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:38.400\n I was always against the clinical precision of classical music.\n\n1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:47.040\n I thought a great piano player should be, like, in pain, like,\n\n1:37:47.040 --> 1:37:55.280\n you know, emotionally, like, truly feel the music and make it\n\n1:37:55.280 --> 1:38:00.080\n messy, sort of maybe play classical music the way, I don't\n\n1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:02.640\n know, blues pianist plays blues.\n\n1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:05.920\n It seems like they actually got happier, and I'm not sure if\n\n1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:10.720\n Beethoven got happier. I think it's a different kind of concept\n\n1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:17.840\n of the place of music. I think the blues, the whole African\n\n1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:21.840\n American tradition was initially surviving awful, awful\n\n1:38:21.840 --> 1:38:23.840\n circumstances. So you could say, you know, there was some of\n\n1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:29.280\n that in the concentration camps and all that too. And it's not\n\n1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:32.400\n that Beethoven's circumstances were brilliant, but he kind of\n\n1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:38.080\n also, I don't know, this is hard. Like, I mean, it would\n\n1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:41.280\n seem to be his misery was somewhat self imposed, maybe\n\n1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:44.240\n through, I don't know. It's kind of interesting, like, I've\n\n1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:47.840\n known some people who loathed Beethoven, like the composer,\n\n1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:50.640\n late composer, Pauline Oliveros, this wonderful modernist\n\n1:38:50.640 --> 1:38:54.160\n composer. I played in her band for a while, and she was like,\n\n1:38:54.160 --> 1:38:56.560\n oh, Beethoven, like, that's the worst music ever. It's like,\n\n1:38:56.560 --> 1:39:02.400\n all ego. It completely, it turns information, I mean, it\n\n1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:08.240\n turns emotion into your enemy. And it's ultimately all about\n\n1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:11.200\n your own self importance, which has to be at the expense of\n\n1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:15.200\n others. What else could it be? And blah, blah, blah. So she\n\n1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:17.200\n had, I shouldn't say, I don't mean to be dismissive, but I'm\n\n1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:21.680\n just saying, like, her position on Beethoven was very negative\n\n1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:24.160\n and very unimpressed, which is really interesting because\n\n1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:27.440\n the manner of the music. I think, I don't know. I mean,\n\n1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:29.360\n she's not here to speak for herself. So it's a little hard\n\n1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:32.560\n for me to answer that question. But it was interesting because\n\n1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:34.400\n I'd always thought of Beethoven as like, whoa, you know, this\n\n1:39:34.400 --> 1:39:38.320\n is like Beethoven is like really the dude, you know, and it's\n\n1:39:38.320 --> 1:39:42.000\n just like, Beethoven, Schmadovan, you know, it's like\n\n1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:44.240\n not really happening. Yeah, I still, even though it's cliche,\n\n1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:47.440\n I like playing personally, just for myself, Moonlight Sonata.\n\n1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:52.560\n I mean, I just, Moonlight's amazing. I mean, it's like,\n\n1:39:52.560 --> 1:39:59.200\n Moonlight's amazing. You know, I, you know, you're talking\n\n1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:02.640\n about comparing the blues and that sensibility from Europe\n\n1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:06.240\n is so different in so many ways. One of the musicians I\n\n1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:09.600\n play with is John Batiste, who has the band on Colbert Show,\n\n1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:12.880\n and he'll sit there playing jazz and suddenly go into\n\n1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:16.240\n Moonlight. He loves Moonlight. And what's kind of interesting\n\n1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:22.000\n is he's found a way to do Beethoven. And he, by the way,\n\n1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:25.680\n he can really do Beethoven. Like, he went through Juilliard\n\n1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:28.800\n and one time he was at my house, he's saying, hey, do you\n\n1:40:28.800 --> 1:40:30.720\n have the book of Beethoven's Sonatas? I say, yeah, I want to\n\n1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:32.320\n find one I haven't played. And then he sight read through the\n\n1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:35.760\n whole damn thing perfectly. And I'm like, oh, God, I just\n\n1:40:35.760 --> 1:40:38.320\n get out of here. I can't even deal with this. But anyway,\n\n1:40:41.200 --> 1:40:45.360\n but anyway, the thing is he has this way of with the same\n\n1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:48.640\n persona and the same philosophy moving from the blues into\n\n1:40:48.640 --> 1:40:51.920\n Beethoven that's really, really fascinating to me. It's like,\n\n1:40:53.680 --> 1:40:56.560\n I don't want to say he plays it as if it were jazz, but he\n\n1:40:56.560 --> 1:41:00.640\n kind of does. It's kind of really, and he talks, well, he\n\n1:41:00.640 --> 1:41:03.200\n was sight reading, he talks like Beethoven's talking to him.\n\n1:41:03.200 --> 1:41:05.840\n Like he's like, oh yeah, here, he's doing this. I can't do\n\n1:41:05.840 --> 1:41:09.040\n John, but you know, it's like, it's really interesting. Like\n\n1:41:09.040 --> 1:41:11.920\n it's very different. Like for me, I was introduced to\n\n1:41:11.920 --> 1:41:14.960\n Beethoven as like almost like this godlike figure, and I\n\n1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:17.680\n presume Pauline was too, that was really kind of a press\n\n1:41:17.680 --> 1:41:20.160\n for an art to deal with. And for him, it's just like the\n\n1:41:20.160 --> 1:41:23.680\n conversation. He's playing James P. Johnson or something. It's\n\n1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:25.920\n like another musician who did something and they're talking\n\n1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:30.800\n and it's very cool to be around. It's very kind of freeing\n\n1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:35.040\n to see someone have that relationship. I would love to\n\n1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:39.760\n hear him play Beethoven. That sounds amazing. He's great. We\n\n1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:45.840\n talked about Ernest Becker and how much value he puts on our\n\n1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:50.720\n mortality and our denial of our mortality. Do you think about\n\n1:41:50.720 --> 1:41:53.760\n your mortality? Do you think about your own death? You know\n\n1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:57.120\n what's funny is I used to not be able to, but as you get older,\n\n1:41:57.120 --> 1:41:59.040\n you just know people who die and there's all these things\n\n1:41:59.040 --> 1:42:04.960\n that just becomes familiar and and more of a more ordinary,\n\n1:42:04.960 --> 1:42:11.600\n which is what it is. But are you afraid? Sure, although less\n\n1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:18.880\n so. And it's not like I didn't have some kind of insight or\n\n1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:22.880\n revelation to become less afraid. I think I just, like I\n\n1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:27.440\n say, it's kind of familiarity. It's just knowing people who've\n\n1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:34.240\n died and I really believe in the future. I have this optimism\n\n1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:37.920\n that people or this whole thing of life on Earth, this whole\n\n1:42:37.920 --> 1:42:39.920\n thing we're part of, I don't know where to draw that circle,\n\n1:42:39.920 --> 1:42:47.280\n but this thing is going somewhere and has some kind of\n\n1:42:47.280 --> 1:42:51.600\n value and you can't both believe in the future and want\n\n1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:54.000\n to live forever. You have to make room for it. You know, like\n\n1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:58.000\n you have to, that optimism has to also come with its own like\n\n1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:01.280\n humility. You have to make yourself small to believe in\n\n1:43:01.280 --> 1:43:06.960\n the future and so it actually in a funny way comforts me.\n\n1:43:06.960 --> 1:43:13.520\n Wow, that's powerful. And optimism requires you to kind\n\n1:43:13.520 --> 1:43:18.720\n of step down after a time. Yeah, I mean, that said, life\n\n1:43:18.720 --> 1:43:22.000\n seems kind of short, but you know, whatever. Do you think\n\n1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.080\n there's I've tried to find I can't find the complaint\n\n1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:26.720\n department. You know, I really want to I want to bring this\n\n1:43:26.720 --> 1:43:29.440\n up, but the customer service number never answers and like\n\n1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:32.480\n the email bounces one way. So yeah, do you think there's\n\n1:43:32.480 --> 1:43:38.080\n meaning to it to life? We'll see. Meaning is a funny word\n\n1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:40.480\n like we say all these things as if we know what they mean, but\n\n1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:43.200\n meaning we don't know what we mean when we say meaning like\n\n1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:47.600\n we obviously do not and it's a it's it's a funny little\n\n1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:50.080\n mystical thing. I think it ultimately connects to that\n\n1:43:50.080 --> 1:43:56.160\n sense of experience that dualists tend to believe in.\n\n1:43:56.160 --> 1:43:58.960\n I guess there are why like if you look up to the stars and\n\n1:43:58.960 --> 1:44:04.960\n you experience that awe inspiring like joy at whatever\n\n1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:07.440\n when you look up to the stars that I don't know why for me\n\n1:44:07.440 --> 1:44:11.280\n that's kind of makes me feel joyful, maybe a little bit\n\n1:44:11.280 --> 1:44:15.680\n melancholy, just some weird soup of feelings and ultimately\n\n1:44:15.680 --> 1:44:22.080\n the question is like why are we here in this vast universe?\n\n1:44:22.080 --> 1:44:25.120\n That question why?\n\n1:44:25.120 --> 1:44:30.080\n Have you been able in some way maybe through music answer it\n\n1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:32.640\n for yourself?\n\n1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:42.480\n My impulse is to feel like it's not quite the right question\n\n1:44:42.480 --> 1:44:46.800\n to ask, but I feel like going down that path is just too\n\n1:44:46.800 --> 1:44:51.840\n tedious for the moment and I don't want to do it, but\n\n1:44:51.840 --> 1:44:56.640\n the wrong question. Well, just because you know, I don't know\n\n1:44:56.640 --> 1:45:01.680\n what meaning is and I think I do know that sense of awe. I\n\n1:45:01.680 --> 1:45:08.000\n grew up in southern New Mexico and the stars were so vivid.\n\n1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:13.200\n I've had some weird misfortunes, but I've had some\n\n1:45:13.200 --> 1:45:19.360\n weird luck also. One of our near neighbors was the head of\n\n1:45:19.360 --> 1:45:22.000\n optics research at White Sands and when he was young he\n\n1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:26.000\n discovered Pluto. His name was Clyde Tombaugh and he taught me\n\n1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:29.200\n how to make telescopes, grinding mirrors and stuff. My dad\n\n1:45:29.200 --> 1:45:33.840\n had also made telescopes when he was a kid, but Clyde had like\n\n1:45:33.840 --> 1:45:37.120\n backyard telescopes that would put to shame a lot of like\n\n1:45:37.120 --> 1:45:40.480\n I mean he really he did his telescopes you know and so\n\n1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:45.040\n I remember he'd let me go and play with him and just like looking at a\n\n1:45:45.040 --> 1:45:48.080\n globular cluster and you're seeing the actual photons and with a good\n\n1:45:48.080 --> 1:45:51.760\n telescope it's really like this object like you can really tell\n\n1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:55.360\n this isn't coming through some intervening information structure this\n\n1:45:55.360 --> 1:45:59.520\n is like the actual photons and it's really a three dimensional object\n\n1:45:59.520 --> 1:46:02.560\n and you have even a feeling for the vastness of it\n\n1:46:02.560 --> 1:46:08.000\n and it's it's it's I don't know I so I definitely I was\n\n1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:13.440\n very very fortunate to have a connection to the sky that way\n\n1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:17.200\n when I was a kid. To have had that experience\n\n1:46:17.200 --> 1:46:21.360\n again the emphasis on experience.\n\n1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:25.920\n It's kind of funny like I feel like sometimes\n\n1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:30.000\n like I've taken when she was younger I took my daughter and her friends to\n\n1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:33.440\n to like a telescope there are a few around here that are\n\n1:46:33.440 --> 1:46:37.120\n kids can go and use and they would like look at Jupiter's moons or something\n\n1:46:37.120 --> 1:46:41.440\n I think like Galilean moons and I don't know if they quite\n\n1:46:41.440 --> 1:46:44.960\n had that because it's like too\n\n1:46:44.960 --> 1:46:49.760\n it's been just too normalized and I think maybe\n\n1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:53.440\n when I was growing up screens weren't that common yet and maybe it's like too\n\n1:46:53.440 --> 1:46:57.920\n confusable with the screen I don't know you know somebody uh\n\n1:46:57.920 --> 1:47:02.080\n brought up in conversation to me somewhere I don't remember who\n\n1:47:02.080 --> 1:47:05.200\n but they they kind of posited this idea that\n\n1:47:05.200 --> 1:47:09.120\n if humans early humans weren't able to see the stars like if\n\n1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:12.080\n earth atmosphere was such there was cloudy\n\n1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:15.600\n that we would not develop human civilization there's something about\n\n1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:20.480\n being able to look up and see a vast universe is like\n\n1:47:20.480 --> 1:47:23.920\n that's fundamental to the development of human civilization\n\n1:47:23.920 --> 1:47:28.800\n I thought that was a curious kind of thought that reminds me of that\n\n1:47:28.800 --> 1:47:32.720\n old Isaac Asimov story where the you know there's this planet where they\n\n1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:35.680\n finally get to see what's in the sky once in a while and it turns out they're in\n\n1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:38.320\n the middle of a globular cluster and they're all these stars and\n\n1:47:38.320 --> 1:47:41.680\n I forget what happens exactly god that's that's from when I was the same age as a\n\n1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:46.720\n kid I don't really remember yeah uh but um yeah I don't know it's uh\n\n1:47:46.720 --> 1:47:49.200\n it's it might be right I'm just thinking of all the\n\n1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:52.240\n civilizations that grew up under clouds I mean like\n\n1:47:52.240 --> 1:47:58.640\n the the vikings needed a special uh diffracting piece of mica to navigate\n\n1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:01.200\n because they could never see the sun they had this thing called a sunstone\n\n1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:03.920\n that they found from this this one cave you know about that\n\n1:48:03.920 --> 1:48:07.840\n so they were in this like uh they were trying to navigate\n\n1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:11.680\n boats you know in the north atlantic with without being able to see the sun\n\n1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:17.520\n because it was cloudy and so they they used uh of a uh\n\n1:48:17.520 --> 1:48:22.240\n a chunk of mica to diffract it in order to be able to align where the sun really\n\n1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:25.040\n was because they couldn't tell by eye and navigate so\n\n1:48:25.040 --> 1:48:27.680\n I'm just saying there are a lot of civilizations that are pretty impressive\n\n1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:31.520\n that had to deal with a lot of clouds uh\n\n1:48:31.520 --> 1:48:35.600\n the amazonians invented our agriculture and they they were probably under\n\n1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:39.840\n clouds a lot I don't know I don't know to me personally the the question of the\n\n1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:44.080\n meaning of life becomes most um\n\n1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:47.680\n vibrant most apparent when you look up at the stars\n\n1:48:47.680 --> 1:48:54.560\n because it makes me feel very small uh that we're not small\n\n1:48:54.560 --> 1:49:00.720\n but then you ask it it still feels that we're special and then the natural\n\n1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:04.240\n question is like well if we are special as I think we\n\n1:49:04.240 --> 1:49:08.000\n are why the heck are we here in this vast\n\n1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:12.560\n universe that ultimately is the question of um\n\n1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:15.920\n right well the meaning of life I mean look\n\n1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:22.800\n there's a confusion sometimes in trying to use uh\n\n1:49:22.800 --> 1:49:26.720\n to set up a question or a thought experiment or something\n\n1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:30.960\n that's defined in terms of a context to explain something\n\n1:49:30.960 --> 1:49:34.480\n where there is no larger context and that's a category error\n\n1:49:34.480 --> 1:49:41.360\n um if we want to do it in physics um or well or in computer science um\n\n1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:44.560\n it's hard to talk about the universe as a Turing machine because a Turing\n\n1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:47.920\n machine has an external clock and an observer and a\n\n1:49:47.920 --> 1:49:51.280\n input and output there's a larger context implied in order for it to be\n\n1:49:51.280 --> 1:49:53.600\n defined at all and so if you're talking about the\n\n1:49:53.600 --> 1:49:57.200\n universe you can't talk about it coherently as a Turing machine uh\n\n1:49:57.200 --> 1:50:01.040\n quantum mechanics is like that quantum mechanics has an external clock and has\n\n1:50:01.040 --> 1:50:04.800\n some kind of external context depending on your interpretation\n\n1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:08.480\n um that's either you know the observer or whatever\n\n1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:12.000\n uh and there's a they're they're similar that way so maybe\n\n1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:16.000\n maybe Turing machines and quantum mechanics can be\n\n1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:19.040\n better friends or something because they have a similar setup but the thing is if\n\n1:50:19.040 --> 1:50:24.240\n you have something that's defined in terms of an outer context you can't\n\n1:50:24.240 --> 1:50:27.600\n talk about ultimates with it because obviously it doesn't\n\n1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:30.960\n it's not suited for that so there's some ideas that\n\n1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:34.400\n are their own context general relativity is its own context\n\n1:50:34.400 --> 1:50:37.840\n it's different that's why it's hard to unify and\n\n1:50:37.840 --> 1:50:42.320\n um i think the same thing is true when we talk about\n\n1:50:42.320 --> 1:50:49.920\n these types of questions like uh meaning is in a context and\n\n1:50:49.920 --> 1:50:53.440\n to talk about ultimate meaning is therefore a category error it's not\n\n1:50:53.440 --> 1:50:59.120\n it's not a um it's not a resolvable way of thinking\n\n1:50:59.120 --> 1:51:05.760\n it might be a way of thinking that is experientially\n\n1:51:06.320 --> 1:51:13.280\n um or aesthetically valuable because it is awesome in the sense of\n\n1:51:13.280 --> 1:51:18.960\n you know awe inspiring um but to try to treat it analytically is not\n\n1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:22.320\n sensible maybe that's what music can poetry for\n\n1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:25.680\n yeah maybe i think so i think music actually does\n\n1:51:25.680 --> 1:51:28.800\n escape any particular context that's how it feels to me but i'm not sure about\n\n1:51:28.800 --> 1:51:33.360\n that that's once again crazy artist talking not scientist\n\n1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:38.960\n well you did uh you do both masterfully uh jaron i'm like i said i'm a big fan\n\n1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:41.280\n of everything you've done of you as a human being\n\n1:51:41.280 --> 1:51:47.360\n um i appreciate the the fun argument we had today that will i'm sure\n\n1:51:47.360 --> 1:51:52.160\n continue for 30 years as it did with mark mitski um honestly\n\n1:51:52.160 --> 1:51:55.520\n i i deeply appreciate that you spend your really valuable time with me today\n\n1:51:55.520 --> 1:51:58.400\n it was a really great conversation thank you so much\n\n1:51:58.400 --> 1:52:01.600\n thanks for listening to this conversation with jaron lanier\n\n1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:06.080\n to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description\n\n1:52:06.080 --> 1:52:10.800\n and now let me leave you with some words from jaron lanier himself\n\n1:52:10.800 --> 1:52:13.840\n a real friendship ought to introduce each person\n\n1:52:13.840 --> 1:52:19.120\n to unexpected weirdness in the other thank you for listening i hope to see\n\n1:52:19.120 --> 1:52:30.960\n you next time\n\n"
