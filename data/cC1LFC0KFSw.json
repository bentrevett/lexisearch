  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:03.480\n I was on the run for four months, stole $600,000.\n\n00:03.480 --> 00:05.120\n I was in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n00:05.120 --> 00:07.320\n One day I had stolen the night before\n\n00:07.320 --> 00:09.500\n and stolen 160K out of ATMs.\n\n00:10.440 --> 00:12.760\n Went in the next morning, I woke up,\n\n00:12.760 --> 00:14.680\n signed on to cartersmarket.com,\n\n00:14.680 --> 00:16.940\n which was ran by Max Butler, the Iceman.\n\n00:17.880 --> 00:21.160\n And there's my name, US Most Wanted on it.\n\n00:21.160 --> 00:24.120\n And that gets your attention.\n\n00:24.120 --> 00:26.480\n That was my real name with US Most Wanted beside of it.\n\n00:26.480 --> 00:29.160\n Nobody knew my real name in that environment at all,\n\n00:29.160 --> 00:30.280\n but then they did.\n\n00:30.280 --> 00:32.080\n And it was talking about me being part\n\n00:32.080 --> 00:34.880\n of the Secret Service, Operation Anglerfish,\n\n00:34.880 --> 00:36.480\n everything else.\n\n00:36.480 --> 00:37.920\n So of course, they're all like.\n\n00:37.920 --> 00:39.040\n Everybody's after you.\n\n00:39.040 --> 00:41.960\n They're like, oh yeah, we're gonna get this son of a bitch.\n\n00:43.720 --> 00:46.200\n The following is a conversation with Brett Johnson,\n\n00:46.200 --> 00:48.680\n a former cyber criminal who built the first\n\n00:48.680 --> 00:52.000\n organized cybercrime community called Shadow Crew\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:54.480\n that is the precursor to today's Darknet\n\n00:54.480 --> 00:56.200\n and Darknet markets.\n\n00:56.200 --> 00:58.960\n He's referred to by the United States Secret Service\n\n00:58.960 --> 01:02.080\n as quote, the original internet godfather.\n\n01:02.080 --> 01:05.120\n He has been the central figure in the cybercrime world\n\n01:05.120 --> 01:06.640\n for almost 20 years.\n\n01:06.640 --> 01:10.280\n Placed on the US Most Wanted list in 2006\n\n01:10.280 --> 01:14.080\n before being convicted of 39 felonies for cybercrime,\n\n01:14.080 --> 01:17.680\n escaped from prison, and then eventually being locked up,\n\n01:17.680 --> 01:21.720\n served his time, and now is helping people understand\n\n01:21.720 --> 01:24.320\n and fight cybercrime.\n\n01:24.320 --> 01:29.320\n This was a raw, honest, emotional, and real episode.\n\n01:29.440 --> 01:32.880\n Brett has caused a lot of pain to a lot of people,\n\n01:32.880 --> 01:36.960\n and yet his own story is full of trauma and pain,\n\n01:36.960 --> 01:39.520\n and also redemption and love.\n\n01:40.480 --> 01:44.240\n This is a good time to say that I have and I will\n\n01:44.240 --> 01:46.760\n talk to people who have served time in prison,\n\n01:46.760 --> 01:50.480\n and perhaps people who currently are in prison.\n\n01:50.480 --> 01:53.080\n I will try to do my best to both empathize\n\n01:53.080 --> 01:56.240\n with the person across from me and not let them sugarcoat,\n\n01:56.240 --> 02:00.440\n explain away, or dismiss the crimes they committed.\n\n02:00.440 --> 02:01.920\n This is a tough line to walk,\n\n02:01.920 --> 02:04.640\n because if you close your heart to the other person,\n\n02:04.640 --> 02:08.000\n you'll never fully understand their mind and their story.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:10.720\n But if you open the heart too much,\n\n02:10.720 --> 02:13.240\n you can be manipulated to where the conversation\n\n02:13.240 --> 02:16.540\n reveals nothing honest or real.\n\n02:17.600 --> 02:21.520\n This requires skill and willingness to take the risk.\n\n02:21.520 --> 02:23.400\n I don't know about the skill part,\n\n02:23.400 --> 02:25.120\n but I'd like to take the risk.\n\n02:25.120 --> 02:27.160\n I always wear my heart on my sleeve.\n\n02:27.160 --> 02:29.800\n If I get hurt for it, that's life.\n\n02:30.860 --> 02:32.600\n As I've said, I want to understand\n\n02:32.600 --> 02:34.620\n what makes a person do these crimes,\n\n02:34.620 --> 02:37.640\n the particular characteristics of their temporary\n\n02:37.640 --> 02:41.560\n or permanent madness, their justifications,\n\n02:41.560 --> 02:43.520\n but also their humanity.\n\n02:43.520 --> 02:45.520\n I believe each of us have the capacity\n\n02:45.520 --> 02:48.320\n to become both the criminal and the victim,\n\n02:48.320 --> 02:50.760\n the predator and the prey.\n\n02:50.760 --> 02:53.200\n It's up to us to avoid these paths\n\n02:53.200 --> 02:55.520\n or to find the path to redemption.\n\n02:55.520 --> 02:57.320\n It's on each of us.\n\n02:57.320 --> 03:00.360\n It's our responsibility and burden\n\n03:00.360 --> 03:04.200\n of being human in a complicated and dangerous world.\n\n03:05.440 --> 03:07.160\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n03:07.160 --> 03:09.200\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n03:09.200 --> 03:10.320\n in the description.\n\n03:10.320 --> 03:14.200\n And now, dear friends, here's Brett Johnson.\n\n03:15.260 --> 03:19.160\n You were convicted of 39 felonies for cybercrime\n\n03:19.160 --> 03:22.920\n placed on the US most wanted list in 2006,\n\n03:22.920 --> 03:24.700\n escaped from prison.\n\n03:24.700 --> 03:27.240\n You built the first organized cybercrime community\n\n03:27.240 --> 03:30.120\n called Shadow Crew that is the precursor\n\n03:30.120 --> 03:32.880\n to today's darknet and darknet markets.\n\n03:32.880 --> 03:36.280\n And for all this, the US intelligence service\n\n03:36.280 --> 03:39.520\n called you the original internet godfather.\n\n03:39.520 --> 03:42.920\n So first question, how did your career\n\n03:42.920 --> 03:45.300\n as a cybercrime criminal begin?\n\n03:45.300 --> 03:47.920\n My life of crime begins when I'm 10 years old.\n\n03:47.920 --> 03:49.440\n 10 years old, man, think about that.\n\n03:49.440 --> 03:51.360\n I mean, you were probably playing the robots\n\n03:51.360 --> 03:52.360\n when you were 10.\n\n03:52.360 --> 03:55.420\n You know, usually kids are doing the Lego bit,\n\n03:55.420 --> 03:57.160\n getting involved with sports, everything else.\n\n03:57.160 --> 04:00.100\n And with me, it wasn't like that.\n\n04:00.100 --> 04:02.360\n With me, I'm from Eastern Kentucky.\n\n04:02.360 --> 04:04.180\n Eastern Kentucky is one of these,\n\n04:05.360 --> 04:08.380\n it's like parts of Texas, parts of Louisiana,\n\n04:08.380 --> 04:11.320\n that if you're not fortunate enough to have a job,\n\n04:11.320 --> 04:13.680\n you may be involved in a scam, hustle, fraud,\n\n04:13.680 --> 04:14.920\n whatever you want to call it, man.\n\n04:14.920 --> 04:19.920\n I was, my parents, my mom was basically\n\n04:20.020 --> 04:22.400\n the captain of the entire fraud industry.\n\n04:22.400 --> 04:25.480\n So this is a woman that at one point,\n\n04:25.480 --> 04:29.760\n she's stealing a 108,000 pound Caterpillar D9 bulldozer,\n\n04:29.760 --> 04:31.280\n tramming it down the road.\n\n04:31.280 --> 04:32.920\n You know, at another point, she's taking a slip\n\n04:32.920 --> 04:35.680\n and falling a convenience store trying to sue the owner.\n\n04:35.680 --> 04:38.920\n We had a neighbor she acted as a pimp for at one point.\n\n04:38.920 --> 04:41.840\n That's my mom, my dad.\n\n04:41.840 --> 04:45.520\n Wait, wait, wait, the neighbor acted as a pimp?\n\n04:45.520 --> 04:47.800\n My mom prostituted, I mean,\n\n04:47.800 --> 04:50.080\n she acted as a pimp for a neighbor.\n\n04:50.080 --> 04:54.680\n Her name was Debbie and my mom used to sell her out.\n\n04:54.680 --> 04:56.740\n Debbie needed money and my mom would find men\n\n04:56.740 --> 04:58.680\n for her to sleep with for cash\n\n04:58.680 --> 05:00.560\n and she'd take a part of the cash.\n\n05:00.560 --> 05:05.080\n So Sauna's like she diversified the methodologies\n\n05:05.080 --> 05:06.940\n by which she hustled.\n\n05:06.940 --> 05:09.840\n Very, had that entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n05:09.840 --> 05:10.680\n Okay.\n\n05:10.680 --> 05:14.120\n You know, we see that a lot with cyber criminals,\n\n05:14.120 --> 05:16.640\n you know, that sense of being that entrepreneur.\n\n05:16.640 --> 05:19.160\n So what was the motivation you think for her?\n\n05:19.160 --> 05:22.600\n Is it money?\n\n05:22.600 --> 05:27.040\n Is it basically the rush of playing with the system\n\n05:27.040 --> 05:30.960\n or being able to know the rules\n\n05:30.960 --> 05:32.920\n and break the rules and get away with it?\n\n05:32.920 --> 05:34.660\n My mom's a complex character.\n\n05:34.660 --> 05:36.880\n She is, there's no one single motivation.\n\n05:36.880 --> 05:40.620\n So my mom was the individual, she's still alive.\n\n05:40.620 --> 05:44.400\n My mom was the individual who tested people.\n\n05:45.360 --> 05:48.040\n She wanted to know how far she could abuse you\n\n05:48.040 --> 05:50.200\n and you come back and still love her.\n\n05:50.200 --> 05:53.940\n So, and that was with every relationship she's ever had.\n\n05:53.940 --> 05:56.120\n She would cheat on the men she was involved with.\n\n05:56.120 --> 05:59.320\n She would abuse her children, me and Denise.\n\n05:59.320 --> 06:00.880\n She would...\n\n06:00.880 --> 06:02.280\n Psychological, physical?\n\n06:02.280 --> 06:05.240\n Oh, it was mental, emotional, physical,\n\n06:06.240 --> 06:07.440\n everything, everything.\n\n06:07.440 --> 06:12.160\n I mean, she used to beat me and Denise with belt buckles,\n\n06:12.160 --> 06:16.160\n you know, and that ended when she was,\n\n06:16.160 --> 06:18.320\n I forgot what we had done.\n\n06:18.320 --> 06:19.160\n It wasn't much.\n\n06:19.160 --> 06:23.260\n I think that it may have been the part\n\n06:23.260 --> 06:26.400\n where she accused me of stealing her marijuana,\n\n06:26.400 --> 06:29.240\n but she was hitting me and Denise.\n\n06:29.240 --> 06:32.680\n We were living in a single wide trailer at that point.\n\n06:32.680 --> 06:33.840\n She was hitting me and Denise.\n\n06:33.840 --> 06:35.920\n We were on the bed trying to get away from it.\n\n06:35.920 --> 06:40.720\n And Denise kicks her through a closet is what happens.\n\n06:40.720 --> 06:43.640\n And Denise stands up and she said,\n\n06:43.640 --> 06:45.720\n you're through hitting me.\n\n06:45.720 --> 06:49.040\n And that was the last time that mom hit us at that point.\n\n06:49.040 --> 06:50.240\n But...\n\n06:50.240 --> 06:51.600\n So sorry to take us there.\n\n06:51.600 --> 06:53.680\n You're, for people who know you\n\n06:53.680 --> 06:55.200\n and people should definitely watch\n\n06:55.200 --> 06:57.100\n some of your lectures online.\n\n06:57.100 --> 07:01.240\n You're extremely charismatic and fun and jolly\n\n07:01.240 --> 07:03.160\n and whatever word you want to use.\n\n07:03.160 --> 07:06.760\n But, you know, if we look at that kind of life,\n\n07:06.760 --> 07:10.900\n there's darkness there, there's a struggle there.\n\n07:10.900 --> 07:12.300\n There's a lot of darkness.\n\n07:12.300 --> 07:16.480\n So if you, how did you feel?\n\n07:16.480 --> 07:20.000\n If you go back to the mind of the kid you were\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:24.200\n with your mom, was there sadness?\n\n07:24.200 --> 07:28.280\n Was there things like depression, self doubt,\n\n07:28.280 --> 07:31.300\n all those kinds of things, or did you see this crime,\n\n07:31.300 --> 07:34.760\n this chaos as ultimately exciting?\n\n07:34.760 --> 07:36.180\n You know, I don't think,\n\n07:36.180 --> 07:37.920\n back then I didn't view it as exciting.\n\n07:37.920 --> 07:40.200\n Now it becomes exciting when I start being involved\n\n07:40.200 --> 07:42.360\n in cyber crime, all right?\n\n07:42.360 --> 07:44.960\n But back then it was simply a means to an end\n\n07:44.960 --> 07:45.800\n was all it was.\n\n07:45.800 --> 07:46.880\n So you take a 10 year old kid\n\n07:46.880 --> 07:49.640\n and the way I get involved in crime is,\n\n07:49.640 --> 07:51.480\n like I said, my mom was the fraudster.\n\n07:51.480 --> 07:53.540\n My dad was a good guy.\n\n07:53.540 --> 07:55.960\n He just forgot he was this good guy.\n\n07:55.960 --> 07:58.400\n You know, he was always, he always had these principles,\n\n07:58.400 --> 08:02.440\n but his issue was is he loved my mom so much,\n\n08:02.440 --> 08:04.840\n he was scared of her leaving.\n\n08:04.840 --> 08:07.980\n So if she wanted to do something, commit crime,\n\n08:07.980 --> 08:10.360\n cheat on him, whatever,\n\n08:10.360 --> 08:14.720\n he would pretty much just put up with it the one instant.\n\n08:14.720 --> 08:16.800\n So, I mean, this woman used to,\n\n08:16.800 --> 08:19.320\n she used to bring men home in front of him,\n\n08:19.320 --> 08:21.160\n tell him that, hey, I'm leaving you.\n\n08:21.160 --> 08:22.160\n I don't love you anymore.\n\n08:22.160 --> 08:24.200\n I want you to die, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n08:24.200 --> 08:25.360\n This was my mom.\n\n08:25.360 --> 08:29.240\n There were two instances where the man,\n\n08:30.880 --> 08:33.060\n where he can't take it anymore.\n\n08:33.060 --> 08:34.720\n And the first instance, I was,\n\n08:34.720 --> 08:36.380\n I guess I was seven or eight.\n\n08:36.380 --> 08:38.620\n My sister Denise is a year younger than I am.\n\n08:38.620 --> 08:41.120\n My dad actually files for divorce,\n\n08:41.120 --> 08:42.880\n files for divorce at that point.\n\n08:42.880 --> 08:44.980\n My mom kind of goes crazy.\n\n08:45.880 --> 08:47.520\n My dad, I was with my dad.\n\n08:47.520 --> 08:49.120\n My sister was with my mother\n\n08:49.120 --> 08:50.840\n because that's that Eastern Kentucky mentality.\n\n08:50.840 --> 08:53.620\n You know, men stay with men, women stay with women.\n\n08:53.620 --> 08:57.880\n So he was filing for divorce.\n\n08:57.880 --> 09:00.600\n Me and my dad, we were living in an apartment.\n\n09:00.600 --> 09:03.920\n My mom was living with her grandparents\n\n09:03.920 --> 09:05.440\n and with her parents bouncing back and forth\n\n09:05.440 --> 09:06.280\n between the two.\n\n09:07.520 --> 09:08.840\n And I remember I was sleeping in the bed.\n\n09:08.840 --> 09:09.920\n We had a single wide bed.\n\n09:09.920 --> 09:12.280\n My dad slept on the sofa.\n\n09:12.280 --> 09:13.280\n I woke up one night\n\n09:13.280 --> 09:16.080\n and there was some sort of ruckus in the living room.\n\n09:16.080 --> 09:18.600\n So I wake up and I walk into the living room\n\n09:18.600 --> 09:22.200\n and my mom has a knife to my dad's throat.\n\n09:22.200 --> 09:25.200\n And basically you're not going to steal my son from me.\n\n09:25.200 --> 09:26.920\n My mom was this individual\n\n09:26.920 --> 09:29.760\n that when she knew she went so far,\n\n09:29.760 --> 09:32.320\n like I said, she was always this person that tested.\n\n09:32.320 --> 09:33.680\n What can I do this to you?\n\n09:33.680 --> 09:35.040\n And you'll still come back.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:39.020\n She knew, she was always also this person\n\n09:39.020 --> 09:42.700\n that if she went too far, she knew it.\n\n09:42.700 --> 09:46.420\n And she would always try to divert that into something else.\n\n09:46.420 --> 09:49.020\n All right, so she knew at that point she'd went too far.\n\n09:49.020 --> 09:50.240\n So what does she do?\n\n09:50.240 --> 09:53.760\n She gets up crying, goes to the bathroom\n\n09:53.760 --> 09:56.800\n and pretends to slit her wrists\n\n09:56.800 --> 10:00.080\n so that my dad Ray will respond to that,\n\n10:00.080 --> 10:02.560\n not respond to what she's just done to him.\n\n10:02.560 --> 10:03.840\n That was my mom in a nutshell.\n\n10:03.840 --> 10:06.140\n She had a history of doing this kind of stuff.\n\n10:07.080 --> 10:09.860\n Motivations as far as fraud with her,\n\n10:09.860 --> 10:14.440\n I think with her it was, she was an LPN.\n\n10:14.440 --> 10:19.440\n She had a very good nurse, but she didn't want to work.\n\n10:19.440 --> 10:21.080\n It was a lot of it.\n\n10:21.080 --> 10:25.400\n So with her, it was easier for her to commit fraud.\n\n10:25.400 --> 10:26.680\n And when I say commit fraud,\n\n10:26.680 --> 10:29.520\n it was against businesses, against people.\n\n10:29.520 --> 10:31.700\n I remember at one point she's buying\n\n10:31.700 --> 10:34.760\n over the counter capsules and emptying the capsules out\n\n10:34.760 --> 10:36.480\n and putting some other crap in there\n\n10:36.480 --> 10:39.280\n and selling at a speed and people were buying it.\n\n10:39.280 --> 10:41.160\n She did anything she could for money.\n\n10:41.160 --> 10:42.520\n And of course I get involved with that.\n\n10:42.520 --> 10:46.960\n What happens is we were in Panama City at that point\n\n10:46.960 --> 10:51.960\n and my mom leaves my dad and the way she left my dad,\n\n10:53.080 --> 10:55.800\n my great grandfather had died.\n\n10:55.800 --> 11:00.040\n My mom tells all three of us, hey, I'm taking the kids\n\n11:00.040 --> 11:01.280\n and we're going back to Eastern Kentucky\n\n11:01.280 --> 11:02.720\n to attend the funeral.\n\n11:02.720 --> 11:05.320\n Well, that was her leaving.\n\n11:05.320 --> 11:06.280\n Me and Denise didn't know it.\n\n11:06.280 --> 11:07.960\n She didn't pack any of our clothes at all.\n\n11:07.960 --> 11:11.000\n She stows her clothes in the trunk of the car\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.640\n and she leaves my dad and I don't get to see my dad again\n\n11:13.640 --> 11:16.920\n for I think five, six years, something like that.\n\n11:16.920 --> 11:18.680\n My mom, like I said, she used to bring men home\n\n11:18.680 --> 11:19.900\n in front of my dad.\n\n11:19.900 --> 11:22.800\n She would, he'd sit there and cry and beg her not to do it.\n\n11:22.800 --> 11:23.840\n She'd do it anyway.\n\n11:24.720 --> 11:28.080\n When she leaves him, she kept up that.\n\n11:28.080 --> 11:31.680\n So we were living at my grandparents house.\n\n11:31.680 --> 11:33.480\n My grandfather, he had converted the house.\n\n11:33.480 --> 11:34.760\n He had raised the house up\n\n11:34.760 --> 11:37.280\n and built apartments underneath of it.\n\n11:37.280 --> 11:39.400\n So me and my sister and my mom lived\n\n11:39.400 --> 11:40.860\n in one of the apartments underneath\n\n11:40.860 --> 11:45.480\n and that whole side of the family was just nuts, was nuts.\n\n11:45.480 --> 11:48.260\n My granddad, Paul, he would,\n\n11:49.920 --> 11:54.360\n this is a man that he didn't want you\n\n11:54.360 --> 11:56.340\n to eat any of his food.\n\n11:56.340 --> 11:58.120\n So, you know, there was no such thing\n\n11:58.120 --> 12:00.360\n as me and Denise going upstairs to eat.\n\n12:00.360 --> 12:03.800\n If he found out me and Denise was taking a bath,\n\n12:03.800 --> 12:06.840\n we were allowed to bath and bathe in two inches of water\n\n12:06.840 --> 12:07.880\n one time a week\n\n12:07.880 --> 12:10.040\n because he didn't want to have to pay the water bill.\n\n12:10.040 --> 12:10.880\n There's rules.\n\n12:10.880 --> 12:11.720\n There are rules.\n\n12:11.720 --> 12:14.600\n You know, if you couldn't have the TV on,\n\n12:14.600 --> 12:15.920\n when he went to bed at night,\n\n12:15.920 --> 12:17.800\n you had to have the television, the volume.\n\n12:17.800 --> 12:20.360\n You could watch it, but without volume\n\n12:20.360 --> 12:22.760\n because if he heard it, he would get up\n\n12:22.760 --> 12:23.600\n in the middle of the night\n\n12:23.600 --> 12:25.280\n and he would kick the power breaker,\n\n12:25.280 --> 12:26.960\n turn off all the power on you.\n\n12:26.960 --> 12:29.280\n This is my, this is my, the family, right?\n\n12:29.280 --> 12:32.320\n So my mom, she used to leave me and Denise at home\n\n12:32.320 --> 12:34.480\n for days, man, for days.\n\n12:34.480 --> 12:36.880\n She'd go out and, you know, party.\n\n12:36.880 --> 12:40.360\n And I mean, sometimes she'd take me into these with her.\n\n12:40.360 --> 12:41.740\n We'd wait in the car.\n\n12:41.740 --> 12:43.900\n Sometimes we'd wait in the living room\n\n12:43.900 --> 12:46.220\n as she went and partied and everything else.\n\n12:46.220 --> 12:48.320\n Most of the time she left us at home\n\n12:48.320 --> 12:52.840\n and my entry into crime, Denise walks in one day,\n\n12:52.840 --> 12:54.640\n she's nine years old, man.\n\n12:54.640 --> 12:55.520\n She walks in one day\n\n12:55.520 --> 12:57.880\n and she's got a pack of pork chops in her hand\n\n12:57.880 --> 13:00.200\n and looked at her and I said, where'd you get that?\n\n13:00.200 --> 13:01.940\n She's like, I stole it.\n\n13:01.940 --> 13:04.400\n And you know, it's like, show me how you did that.\n\n13:04.400 --> 13:05.360\n So she takes me over\n\n13:05.360 --> 13:07.040\n and she shows me how she steals food,\n\n13:07.040 --> 13:09.120\n how she's stuffing it down her pants.\n\n13:09.120 --> 13:10.160\n So we start stealing food.\n\n13:10.160 --> 13:11.860\n I'm like, hell yeah, let's do that shit.\n\n13:11.860 --> 13:13.440\n So start stealing food.\n\n13:13.440 --> 13:16.040\n And we get to the point where we're wanting a sandwich.\n\n13:16.040 --> 13:18.560\n Well, you can't stuff a loaf of bread down your pants.\n\n13:18.560 --> 13:20.980\n So there was a Kmart in the shopping center.\n\n13:20.980 --> 13:25.360\n I go over to the Kmart, get a hoodie off the rack,\n\n13:25.360 --> 13:28.480\n take the tags off of it, wear it out, work just fine.\n\n13:28.480 --> 13:29.600\n And the way you steal bread\n\n13:29.600 --> 13:31.440\n is you put the hoodie over your shoulder,\n\n13:31.440 --> 13:32.880\n stuff a loaf of bread down the sleeve\n\n13:32.880 --> 13:34.360\n and you walk out with it.\n\n13:34.360 --> 13:35.400\n So we started doing that.\n\n13:35.400 --> 13:36.840\n How'd you figure that out?\n\n13:36.840 --> 13:38.160\n Just thought pattern.\n\n13:38.160 --> 13:43.160\n So there's like strategic thinking here.\n\n13:43.920 --> 13:45.320\n Yeah, you know, you can't wear the hoodie\n\n13:45.320 --> 13:46.400\n and put the bread down here\n\n13:46.400 --> 13:48.840\n cause you might mash the bread when you zip it up\n\n13:48.840 --> 13:49.680\n or they might notice the bread.\n\n13:49.680 --> 13:50.520\n Yeah, we have to think through that.\n\n13:50.520 --> 13:51.740\n You gotta think through it.\n\n13:51.740 --> 13:53.800\n But you gotta realize by this point,\n\n13:53.800 --> 13:57.120\n I'm already seeing what my parents are doing.\n\n13:57.120 --> 13:59.520\n You know, I'm already seeing the plotting.\n\n13:59.520 --> 14:01.000\n That kind of puzzle solving\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:02.760\n was something you were already developing yourself\n\n14:02.760 --> 14:04.200\n individually cause you're pretty young.\n\n14:04.200 --> 14:05.840\n Yeah, 10 years old, pretty young.\n\n14:05.840 --> 14:08.400\n But seeing how they act, how they respond to things.\n\n14:08.400 --> 14:11.280\n And my mom, I guess you could call it a good thing,\n\n14:11.280 --> 14:14.800\n they never kept any of that hidden from the kids.\n\n14:14.800 --> 14:17.720\n You know, there was no discussions behind closed doors.\n\n14:17.720 --> 14:19.300\n All that happened in front of everybody.\n\n14:19.300 --> 14:22.320\n And from your young minds perspective,\n\n14:22.320 --> 14:25.920\n seeing that kind of crime, you basically,\n\n14:25.920 --> 14:27.660\n you know, a lot of us kind of grow up\n\n14:27.660 --> 14:29.820\n thinking there's rules you're not supposed to break.\n\n14:29.820 --> 14:31.940\n If you see other humans breaking those rules,\n\n14:31.940 --> 14:35.680\n then you realize those rules are just human made.\n\n14:35.680 --> 14:37.120\n But it gets worse than that.\n\n14:37.120 --> 14:41.920\n I was in an environment where there were no decent people.\n\n14:42.880 --> 14:45.040\n I didn't really meet my first decent person\n\n14:45.040 --> 14:47.160\n until I was 16 years old.\n\n14:47.160 --> 14:48.000\n Who's that?\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:49.920\n That was a high school teacher.\n\n14:49.920 --> 14:54.480\n So what happens is, you know, we start shoplifting food.\n\n14:54.480 --> 14:56.720\n My mom finds out that we've been stealing stuff\n\n14:56.720 --> 14:59.040\n and you know, she joins us.\n\n14:59.040 --> 14:59.880\n What's that?\n\n14:59.880 --> 15:00.880\n She joins us.\n\n15:00.880 --> 15:02.780\n Yeah, she comes in, you know, I've got the television,\n\n15:02.780 --> 15:05.120\n I've got the Atari 2600, play the hell out of it.\n\n15:05.120 --> 15:05.960\n Oh my God.\n\n15:05.960 --> 15:06.880\n She starts seeing this shit.\n\n15:06.880 --> 15:08.020\n She's like, where'd this come from?\n\n15:08.020 --> 15:09.200\n And I'm like, well, we found it.\n\n15:09.200 --> 15:10.360\n She's like, you didn't find that.\n\n15:10.360 --> 15:13.520\n Denise, Denise stands up, we stole it.\n\n15:13.520 --> 15:16.680\n My mom, show me how you did that.\n\n15:16.680 --> 15:19.520\n And she gets her mom too, to join in.\n\n15:19.520 --> 15:20.760\n And she used to run me and Denise\n\n15:20.760 --> 15:21.980\n as these little shoplifters.\n\n15:21.980 --> 15:24.520\n We'd take, you know, we'd steal stuff for her.\n\n15:24.520 --> 15:27.760\n We would distract security\n\n15:27.760 --> 15:30.840\n and her and my grandmother would steal stuff.\n\n15:30.840 --> 15:32.380\n They got caught doing that.\n\n15:32.380 --> 15:34.920\n But that's the entry into crime.\n\n15:34.920 --> 15:39.920\n And Denise, you know, I'm adamant and I kind of mean it.\n\n15:41.280 --> 15:45.760\n But the truth is I say, and I do mean it,\n\n15:45.760 --> 15:49.760\n that I'm responsible for my choices as an adult, all right?\n\n15:49.760 --> 15:52.240\n I believe that when you're a child, you can't control that.\n\n15:52.240 --> 15:55.020\n The adults in your environment control what you do.\n\n15:55.020 --> 15:55.860\n All right?\n\n15:55.860 --> 15:58.900\n Once you're an adult though, your choices are yours.\n\n15:58.900 --> 16:01.760\n Now that being said, there's some,\n\n16:03.700 --> 16:06.060\n you can't dismiss that childhood\n\n16:07.940 --> 16:10.880\n influencing what I did as an adult.\n\n16:10.880 --> 16:12.140\n You can't do that.\n\n16:12.140 --> 16:14.960\n I mean, it was kind of written on slate that,\n\n16:14.960 --> 16:18.280\n hey, this guy's gonna be this guy when he grows up.\n\n16:18.280 --> 16:20.740\n That's like sometimes that one person you meet,\n\n16:20.740 --> 16:23.800\n that decent person can turn the tide of your life.\n\n16:23.800 --> 16:24.640\n Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n16:24.640 --> 16:26.600\n So what happens is, you know, the abuse,\n\n16:26.600 --> 16:30.520\n everything continues on, when I'm 15,\n\n16:30.520 --> 16:33.520\n my dad was in Panama City, Florida.\n\n16:33.520 --> 16:36.680\n My mom was in, you know, we were in Hazard, Kentucky.\n\n16:38.560 --> 16:40.520\n She was dating this guy.\n\n16:40.520 --> 16:45.520\n My mom was this woman that the abuse would,\n\n16:46.280 --> 16:49.500\n it was crazy abuse, man, just crazy stuff.\n\n16:49.500 --> 16:52.040\n She would tell me and my sister, you know,\n\n16:52.040 --> 16:55.080\n that she gave up her life for us,\n\n16:55.080 --> 16:57.680\n that she was gonna leave one day and never come back,\n\n16:57.680 --> 17:00.240\n that we'd find her dead in a ditch someplace.\n\n17:00.240 --> 17:02.080\n She'd go out and date these men and she'd come back\n\n17:02.080 --> 17:05.680\n and she'd talk about how these men were abusing her.\n\n17:05.680 --> 17:07.560\n You know, so she'd be dating this guy\n\n17:07.560 --> 17:10.680\n and she'd come back and she'd, you know,\n\n17:10.680 --> 17:13.080\n start talking about how he had tried to rape her,\n\n17:13.080 --> 17:14.640\n you know, trying to get me to respond to that.\n\n17:14.640 --> 17:16.100\n And I would respond to that.\n\n17:16.100 --> 17:18.520\n Make no doubt, I would respond to that.\n\n17:18.520 --> 17:21.320\n Well, what happens is, and I knew that,\n\n17:21.320 --> 17:23.920\n I don't know if I knew it was abuse at that age, all right,\n\n17:23.920 --> 17:25.840\n but I knew things were fucked up.\n\n17:25.840 --> 17:29.200\n And I was talking to my dad in Panama City\n\n17:29.200 --> 17:30.840\n and I really had it in my head\n\n17:30.840 --> 17:35.480\n that I was gonna go down and live with my dad.\n\n17:35.480 --> 17:40.480\n And I called my dad one day.\n\n17:40.480 --> 17:42.920\n I was set to go to, me and my cousins\n\n17:42.920 --> 17:45.240\n were gonna go see Return of the Jedi.\n\n17:45.240 --> 17:48.160\n It had came out again in the theaters.\n\n17:48.160 --> 17:50.480\n So I called my dad, it was a Sunday,\n\n17:50.480 --> 17:52.840\n called my dad and he told me,\n\n17:52.840 --> 17:54.480\n he had either gotten married\n\n17:54.480 --> 17:56.880\n or he was about to get married to this woman.\n\n17:56.880 --> 17:59.480\n And basically Brett Johnson\n\n17:59.480 --> 18:01.200\n wasn't gonna go down to Florida.\n\n18:01.200 --> 18:03.680\n You know, I was gonna stay in Hazard.\n\n18:03.680 --> 18:05.060\n I had to call my dad from payphone,\n\n18:05.060 --> 18:09.440\n but the result of that was I walked him into a hospital,\n\n18:11.320 --> 18:15.560\n got in an elevator and a woman got in the elevator\n\n18:15.560 --> 18:18.160\n at the same time and I snapped\n\n18:18.160 --> 18:21.200\n and beat the hell out of her right there.\n\n18:21.200 --> 18:26.200\n And I was 15, didn't really know what the fuck happened.\n\n18:27.320 --> 18:29.000\n Didn't really know, but.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:30.520\n Just anger came from somewhere.\n\n18:30.520 --> 18:32.080\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n18:32.080 --> 18:37.080\n And you know, the elevator,\n\n18:37.640 --> 18:40.000\n beat the hell out of this lady.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.520\n Turned out she looked a shitload like my mom,\n\n18:43.760 --> 18:48.760\n but the elevator doors open.\n\n18:48.760 --> 18:51.420\n And one of the security guards,\n\n18:51.420 --> 18:53.500\n I played basketball with his son.\n\n18:53.500 --> 18:55.140\n So he saw me immediately.\n\n18:55.140 --> 18:58.620\n I knocked the hell out of him, took off running,\n\n18:58.620 --> 19:02.940\n made it back to the house where my grandparents were.\n\n19:02.940 --> 19:04.020\n They didn't know what had happened.\n\n19:04.020 --> 19:06.580\n So I didn't say anything.\n\n19:07.500 --> 19:10.140\n About an hour later, Kentucky state police,\n\n19:10.140 --> 19:13.820\n they pull up in the front yard and two of them get out\n\n19:13.820 --> 19:16.620\n and I'm sitting on the front porch and me and my cousins are\n\n19:16.620 --> 19:18.940\n and they start walking up where everybody starts walking\n\n19:18.940 --> 19:19.780\n out of the house.\n\n19:19.780 --> 19:21.700\n And I'm like, I just remember saying, what do you want?\n\n19:21.700 --> 19:22.520\n What do you want?\n\n19:22.520 --> 19:23.900\n Well, you know what they wanted.\n\n19:23.900 --> 19:27.820\n They wanted to arrest Brett Johnson and they arrested me.\n\n19:27.820 --> 19:29.740\n I went in and I told them everything.\n\n19:31.340 --> 19:33.220\n Spent three months in a county jail.\n\n19:33.220 --> 19:37.580\n They didn't have juvenile facilities in that county.\n\n19:37.580 --> 19:42.440\n So I spent three months in solitary, went to trial,\n\n19:42.440 --> 19:44.740\n pled guilty to assault in the first degree.\n\n19:44.740 --> 19:48.540\n The judge sentenced me to time served\n\n19:48.540 --> 19:50.180\n and a psychological evaluation\n\n19:50.180 --> 19:52.640\n where they sent me to Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n19:54.020 --> 19:55.780\n Spent 30 days up there and they cut me loose.\n\n19:55.780 --> 19:59.180\n They wanted me to have counseling after that\n\n19:59.180 --> 20:02.740\n and never went to counseling.\n\n20:02.740 --> 20:05.540\n You know, I wanted to, but mom was like, don't need it.\n\n20:05.540 --> 20:08.140\n And so never went to counseling.\n\n20:08.140 --> 20:13.140\n And I became this pariah in the county. It's crazy, man.\n\n20:16.780 --> 20:21.580\n I mean, not a day goes by that I don't think about that.\n\n20:21.580 --> 20:23.460\n That moment in the elevator.\n\n20:23.460 --> 20:24.580\n Yeah.\n\n20:24.580 --> 20:29.140\n And what happens is, you know, you're 15.\n\n20:29.140 --> 20:30.520\n Fuck man, you're 15.\n\n20:31.580 --> 20:34.660\n So I go back to the high school that I was in\n\n20:34.660 --> 20:38.700\n and I'm this piece of shit.\n\n20:38.700 --> 20:41.460\n So everybody, you're not the outcast.\n\n20:41.460 --> 20:43.280\n Everybody knows.\n\n20:43.280 --> 20:47.120\n So I moved, we moved, we were in Whitesburg at that point.\n\n20:47.120 --> 20:52.120\n I finished up the year there and moved back to Perry County,\n\n20:52.260 --> 20:54.220\n which is where Hazard is.\n\n20:55.140 --> 20:57.940\n So we moved there and they've got three high schools here.\n\n20:57.940 --> 21:00.260\n They've got MC Napier, they've got Hazard High School\n\n21:00.260 --> 21:02.700\n and then they've got Dills Combs High School.\n\n21:02.700 --> 21:06.100\n So I was within, me and Denise were within\n\n21:07.500 --> 21:09.360\n half mile of MC Napier.\n\n21:10.820 --> 21:12.700\n Show up there the first day of school\n\n21:13.700 --> 21:16.100\n and I met me and my mom and my sister\n\n21:16.100 --> 21:19.500\n were walking into the school and the kids won't let me in.\n\n21:20.640 --> 21:25.320\n The kids stand out there, he's not coming in.\n\n21:26.740 --> 21:29.240\n So my mom starts raising hell and I'm like,\n\n21:29.240 --> 21:30.780\n nah, let's just go, let's go.\n\n21:30.780 --> 21:33.380\n So from there it was, we went down to the city school,\n\n21:33.380 --> 21:36.940\n Hazard and the principal tells my mom,\n\n21:36.940 --> 21:39.380\n Denise can come, he can't.\n\n21:40.540 --> 21:43.660\n So my mom wants to raise hell and I'm like, no,\n\n21:43.660 --> 21:45.700\n let's just take me to this other school.\n\n21:45.700 --> 21:48.340\n So this other school was like 15 miles away\n\n21:48.340 --> 21:52.460\n and country high school.\n\n21:55.320 --> 21:57.140\n So I go there and they accept me\n\n21:57.140 --> 21:59.220\n and I walked in the first day\n\n21:59.220 --> 22:01.820\n and this English teacher\n\n22:04.020 --> 22:07.220\n name's Carol Combs, I walked in\n\n22:07.220 --> 22:11.940\n and handed her the paper, she was my homeroom teacher\n\n22:11.940 --> 22:14.380\n and she heard this voice,\n\n22:14.380 --> 22:15.820\n that is the way she explains it today,\n\n22:15.820 --> 22:19.660\n she heard this voice and she looks up\n\n22:19.660 --> 22:24.020\n and she was like, son, have you ever done any drama before?\n\n22:24.020 --> 22:27.580\n And I'm like, no maam,\n\n22:27.580 --> 22:29.240\n but I'm interested in the academic team,\n\n22:29.240 --> 22:31.340\n I was this quick recall guy, right?\n\n22:31.340 --> 22:33.080\n And she's like, no.\n\n22:33.080 --> 22:35.760\n She's like, drama.\n\n22:37.580 --> 22:39.980\n I'm like, no, I'm not interested in theater,\n\n22:39.980 --> 22:41.980\n I'm interested in academics.\n\n22:41.980 --> 22:44.520\n Well, she was the head of the drama department\n\n22:44.520 --> 22:46.040\n and head of the academics department.\n\n22:46.040 --> 22:48.500\n So the deal was, tell you what,\n\n22:48.500 --> 22:50.440\n you can get on the academics team\n\n22:50.440 --> 22:53.100\n if you start with theater too.\n\n22:53.100 --> 22:54.780\n And I was like, okay.\n\n22:54.780 --> 22:56.780\n So what happens is she was the only,\n\n22:56.780 --> 22:58.700\n she was the first decent person I met in my life\n\n22:58.700 --> 23:01.820\n and she became this kind of surrogate mother to me.\n\n23:01.820 --> 23:03.680\n So under her tutelage,\n\n23:04.740 --> 23:08.540\n I become one of the top academic team guys in the state.\n\n23:09.740 --> 23:11.380\n Around there, I was captain of the team,\n\n23:11.380 --> 23:15.740\n I was this just scourge across all the counties\n\n23:15.740 --> 23:16.660\n in that part of Kentucky.\n\n23:16.660 --> 23:20.080\n If we had a meet, it was like,\n\n23:20.080 --> 23:21.780\n Jesus Christ, that's Brett Johnson.\n\n23:21.780 --> 23:26.580\n And it was like, she used to tell people\n\n23:26.580 --> 23:29.900\n they would, the high school that I came from was Whitesburg\n\n23:29.900 --> 23:32.820\n and the first time that Whitesburg came against us,\n\n23:32.820 --> 23:35.740\n she told me, I was talking to her about a year ago\n\n23:35.740 --> 23:37.920\n and she told me, she's like, Brett,\n\n23:37.920 --> 23:40.420\n she said, that first meet against Whitesburg,\n\n23:40.420 --> 23:45.180\n she said, the captain came in, looked at you and said,\n\n23:45.180 --> 23:47.580\n oh, you've got that Johnson boy on your team?\n\n23:47.580 --> 23:52.240\n And she said, my response was that Johnson boy is our team.\n\n23:52.240 --> 23:57.240\n So, but I did that and then with theater,\n\n23:57.740 --> 24:00.540\n I ended up, my senior year,\n\n24:00.540 --> 24:04.060\n I won best actor and actress in the state.\n\n24:04.060 --> 24:05.940\n Only guy to ever do that in the state.\n\n24:05.940 --> 24:08.920\n So, did pretty well, man, did pretty well.\n\n24:08.920 --> 24:11.900\n Had scholarships coming out of high school\n\n24:11.900 --> 24:14.460\n and everything else and I'm the idiot that turned them down.\n\n24:14.460 --> 24:15.700\n Ask you a funny question.\n\n24:15.700 --> 24:16.620\n Yeah.\n\n24:16.620 --> 24:18.300\n You'd make a hell of a, I mean,\n\n24:18.300 --> 24:20.220\n of all the many things you could probably do,\n\n24:20.220 --> 24:23.140\n you would make a hell of a actor.\n\n24:23.140 --> 24:24.820\n I'm very good on stage.\n\n24:24.820 --> 24:26.020\n I'm very good on stage.\n\n24:26.020 --> 24:28.780\n Have you acted professionally anywhere or not?\n\n24:28.780 --> 24:29.620\n Not professionally.\n\n24:29.620 --> 24:31.900\n We've done the college circuit and stuff like that.\n\n24:31.900 --> 24:35.900\n What happened was is, so I turned down the scholarships,\n\n24:38.260 --> 24:40.140\n you know, scared of leaving, I guess is what it was.\n\n24:40.140 --> 24:41.820\n Started in community college\n\n24:41.820 --> 24:44.580\n and the community college there hires\n\n24:44.580 --> 24:46.340\n a new theater director out of California.\n\n24:46.340 --> 24:48.020\n Well, he knew the guy\n\n24:48.020 --> 24:50.900\n that ran the San Jose State Theater program.\n\n24:50.900 --> 24:53.020\n A guy named Edward Emmanuel was his name.\n\n24:53.020 --> 24:56.340\n His claim to fame, he had written the Three Ninjas movie.\n\n24:56.340 --> 24:58.460\n Remember that, the three little ninja kids\n\n24:58.460 --> 25:00.780\n back in the eighties, he had written this damn film\n\n25:00.780 --> 25:02.900\n and it had made a shitload of money.\n\n25:02.900 --> 25:06.140\n So, he invites Ed Emmanuel to come down and see the play\n\n25:06.140 --> 25:09.120\n and Ed had written this Civil War piece.\n\n25:09.120 --> 25:11.440\n So, we put that on.\n\n25:11.440 --> 25:13.660\n I was doing like, it was a multiple role thing.\n\n25:13.660 --> 25:16.140\n I was doing like 18 different roles in the show.\n\n25:16.140 --> 25:19.580\n So, Ed sees the show and he was like, scholarship.\n\n25:19.580 --> 25:20.780\n He said, look, he said,\n\n25:20.780 --> 25:22.660\n right now you're a big fish in a small pond.\n\n25:22.660 --> 25:24.180\n We'll make you a big fish in a big pot.\n\n25:24.180 --> 25:25.620\n And I was like, deal.\n\n25:25.620 --> 25:27.580\n So, I took the scholarship, man.\n\n25:27.580 --> 25:29.280\n And he was like, I'll be back in two weeks.\n\n25:29.280 --> 25:30.380\n So, he flies out.\n\n25:30.380 --> 25:32.820\n Two weeks later, this guy flies back in.\n\n25:32.820 --> 25:35.400\n He drives down to where I'm living.\n\n25:35.400 --> 25:39.580\n I'm out shooting ball with one of my cousins and friends.\n\n25:39.580 --> 25:42.620\n He pulls up and he gets out of the car\n\n25:42.620 --> 25:43.940\n and I was like, I'm walking over to him.\n\n25:43.940 --> 25:45.820\n I was like, hey man, I'll walk you in.\n\n25:45.820 --> 25:47.020\n You can meet my parents.\n\n25:47.020 --> 25:48.540\n He's like, no, I got it.\n\n25:48.540 --> 25:49.540\n I was like, okay.\n\n25:49.540 --> 25:50.500\n So, I keep shooting ball.\n\n25:50.500 --> 25:54.780\n He walks in the house, stays about 15 minutes,\n\n25:54.780 --> 25:58.620\n walks out, white as a sheet, doesn't say a word to me,\n\n25:58.620 --> 26:00.980\n gets in the car, leaves.\n\n26:00.980 --> 26:02.760\n I don't hear from him again.\n\n26:02.760 --> 26:04.780\n Had no idea what went on.\n\n26:04.780 --> 26:06.580\n Takes me a couple of weeks.\n\n26:06.580 --> 26:10.620\n What happened is my mom, he walks in and introduces himself.\n\n26:10.620 --> 26:12.260\n My mom pulls a knife on the guy.\n\n26:13.420 --> 26:14.780\n I will kill you.\n\n26:14.780 --> 26:17.700\n You are not going to steal my goddamn son from me.\n\n26:17.700 --> 26:19.340\n Scares the guy to death.\n\n26:19.340 --> 26:24.340\n He bugs out and kind of broke my spirit at that point.\n\n26:24.340 --> 26:27.020\n I was like, okay.\n\n26:27.020 --> 26:32.020\n So, went into, just full fledged into scams,\n\n26:32.940 --> 26:34.080\n crimes, everything else.\n\n26:34.080 --> 26:37.220\n I had already been, when I was a minor,\n\n26:37.220 --> 26:39.100\n I'd already been kind of brought up\n\n26:39.100 --> 26:40.740\n on that side of the family with the crimes\n\n26:40.740 --> 26:41.580\n that they were doing.\n\n26:41.580 --> 26:45.380\n My mom was drug trafficking, the pimp stuff,\n\n26:45.380 --> 26:48.780\n illegally mining coal, charity fraud.\n\n26:48.780 --> 26:50.100\n Illegally mining coal?\n\n26:50.100 --> 26:51.380\n Yeah, wildcatting coal.\n\n26:51.380 --> 26:52.220\n So, you...\n\n26:52.220 --> 26:53.060\n Can you explain that?\n\n26:53.060 --> 26:55.980\n Yeah, so, to properly mine coal,\n\n26:55.980 --> 26:58.580\n you have to get a permit, all right?\n\n26:58.580 --> 27:00.460\n Eastern Kentucky, a lot of people don't,\n\n27:00.460 --> 27:02.580\n they can't afford the permits.\n\n27:02.580 --> 27:04.340\n They can get them a piece of equipment.\n\n27:04.340 --> 27:06.420\n You get a dozer or a loader or whatever you're going to get\n\n27:06.420 --> 27:08.260\n or an auger or what have you.\n\n27:08.260 --> 27:10.740\n So, you start mining, but you don't get the permit.\n\n27:10.740 --> 27:12.900\n So, you don't have to do the, you don't have to pay.\n\n27:12.900 --> 27:15.740\n Back then, it was like $3,500 for a two acre permit\n\n27:15.740 --> 27:17.620\n or $5,000 for a two acre permit.\n\n27:17.620 --> 27:20.540\n Let you strip mine the coal on that.\n\n27:20.540 --> 27:22.780\n Then you have to pay for the reclamation on top of that.\n\n27:22.780 --> 27:25.740\n So, once you uncover the pit, take the coal out,\n\n27:25.740 --> 27:28.700\n you have to cover back up the pit, sow grass,\n\n27:28.700 --> 27:30.420\n make sure everything is environmentally friendly.\n\n27:30.420 --> 27:32.940\n You got a silt pond, everything else at that point.\n\n27:32.940 --> 27:35.060\n So, the whole idea is you buy an acre of land\n\n27:35.060 --> 27:36.940\n or some area of land and then you can,\n\n27:36.940 --> 27:38.580\n there's a whole process you're supposed to go through.\n\n27:38.580 --> 27:39.580\n Entire process.\n\n27:39.580 --> 27:41.940\n How many people involved in a mining,\n\n27:41.940 --> 27:43.980\n the smallest number of people required\n\n27:43.980 --> 27:45.060\n for a mining operation?\n\n27:45.060 --> 27:46.820\n You can do it with three or four people.\n\n27:46.820 --> 27:47.660\n Okay.\n\n27:47.660 --> 27:48.480\n So, you've got your loader operator,\n\n27:48.480 --> 27:49.900\n you've got your dozer operator.\n\n27:49.900 --> 27:52.860\n You need, you can farm out the trucking to someone\n\n27:52.860 --> 27:56.540\n if you need that or trucking company if you need to do that.\n\n27:56.540 --> 27:58.700\n Then you've got your, whoever owns the business as well.\n\n27:58.700 --> 28:01.780\n So, very few people can run an operation like that\n\n28:01.780 --> 28:04.700\n and profit fairly well as long as\n\n28:04.700 --> 28:07.100\n you don't have to do the reclamation,\n\n28:07.100 --> 28:08.860\n all that crap on top of it, all right?\n\n28:08.860 --> 28:10.900\n The reclamation gets pretty expensive.\n\n28:10.900 --> 28:12.900\n So, if you're uncovering a pit of coal,\n\n28:14.460 --> 28:18.100\n a pit, so a ton of coal is basically about 36 cubic inches\n\n28:18.100 --> 28:20.700\n is what a 2000 pounds of coal weighs\n\n28:20.700 --> 28:21.860\n if you're in Eastern Kentucky\n\n28:21.860 --> 28:24.420\n because it's at the weight of the bituminous coal\n\n28:24.420 --> 28:25.260\n and everything.\n\n28:25.260 --> 28:26.580\n The fact that you know this is awesome.\n\n28:26.580 --> 28:31.580\n The fact that you know exactly the volume\n\n28:32.140 --> 28:34.340\n of a ton of coal, I mean, it's great.\n\n28:34.340 --> 28:35.500\n Yeah, you learn this shit, right?\n\n28:35.500 --> 28:36.620\n Can you rattle this shit off?\n\n28:36.620 --> 28:40.220\n So, you uncover the pit and then you've got to sell the pit.\n\n28:40.220 --> 28:41.860\n Well, the thing is, is that,\n\n28:41.860 --> 28:43.260\n where are you gonna sell the coal?\n\n28:43.260 --> 28:45.700\n Well, you sell it to one of these other coal tipples\n\n28:45.700 --> 28:48.660\n that knows that they're buying the shit illegally.\n\n28:48.660 --> 28:50.620\n So, back then a ton of coal was,\n\n28:50.620 --> 28:54.140\n they'd give you like 36 bucks per ton is what that is.\n\n28:54.140 --> 28:56.700\n And you'd have to go out and you'd test the BTUs on it.\n\n28:56.700 --> 28:58.980\n You take a sample to the lab, test the BTUs,\n\n28:58.980 --> 28:59.820\n you take that into the company.\n\n28:59.820 --> 29:00.820\n What BTU?\n\n29:00.820 --> 29:02.220\n British Thermal Unit.\n\n29:02.220 --> 29:04.780\n So, you'd test what the BTU on the coal was.\n\n29:04.780 --> 29:05.860\n How pure the coal is.\n\n29:05.860 --> 29:08.900\n How pure the coal is, what BTU it burns at.\n\n29:08.900 --> 29:12.540\n Back then, a good BTU was around 12.9\n\n29:12.540 --> 29:14.100\n was what you'd get, all right?\n\n29:14.100 --> 29:17.020\n So, 12.9 coal, $36 a ton.\n\n29:17.020 --> 29:19.420\n You'd take that sample over to the coal tipple.\n\n29:19.420 --> 29:21.540\n They'd say, okay, we'll buy this for you.\n\n29:21.540 --> 29:23.140\n How many trucks you got or how many tons you got?\n\n29:23.140 --> 29:24.700\n And you'd say, this is what we've got.\n\n29:24.700 --> 29:26.180\n Then you'd hire the trucking company.\n\n29:26.180 --> 29:29.900\n And where you get it out because you've got the agents\n\n29:29.900 --> 29:32.260\n that are looking for you by this point\n\n29:32.260 --> 29:36.020\n because the people that you've bought the rights\n\n29:36.020 --> 29:37.660\n to whoever the landowner is,\n\n29:37.660 --> 29:41.380\n you said you're gonna give them $2 a ton or whatever this is.\n\n29:41.380 --> 29:42.500\n Well, the other people there,\n\n29:42.500 --> 29:45.220\n are you paying them off or are you not?\n\n29:45.220 --> 29:47.060\n Well, if you're not paying them off, guess what?\n\n29:47.060 --> 29:49.940\n They know your ass is mining it illegally.\n\n29:49.940 --> 29:50.980\n They're gonna report you.\n\n29:50.980 --> 29:53.220\n Well, all of a sudden, you've got all these inspectors\n\n29:53.220 --> 29:54.420\n that are coming around and everything.\n\n29:54.420 --> 29:55.940\n Hey, we know what you're doing.\n\n29:55.940 --> 29:57.540\n So, they're looking for you to get the pit out.\n\n29:57.540 --> 29:58.940\n So, when do you get the pit out?\n\n29:58.940 --> 30:00.140\n Right in dead of night.\n\n30:00.140 --> 30:02.940\n So, you're loading it up two o clock in the morning,\n\n30:02.940 --> 30:04.740\n hauling this ass out is what you're doing.\n\n30:04.740 --> 30:06.260\n You sell it out from there.\n\n30:06.260 --> 30:07.100\n So.\n\n30:07.100 --> 30:08.940\n And your mom ran operations like this?\n\n30:08.940 --> 30:10.220\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n30:10.220 --> 30:12.500\n And you said you worked the mine too when you were younger?\n\n30:12.500 --> 30:14.180\n Yeah, I learned how to run a loader, run a dozer,\n\n30:14.180 --> 30:18.700\n learn how to clean off a pit, everything like that.\n\n30:18.700 --> 30:22.020\n So, this is the lifestyle you grow up in.\n\n30:22.020 --> 30:23.540\n You learn how to do this stuff.\n\n30:23.540 --> 30:27.100\n And so, I knew how to do charity fraud as well,\n\n30:27.100 --> 30:28.540\n insurance fraud, so.\n\n30:28.540 --> 30:29.660\n Charity fraud.\n\n30:29.660 --> 30:31.820\n Can we break down some of these?\n\n30:31.820 --> 30:34.580\n Charity fraud, it's much more romantic than what it sounds.\n\n30:34.580 --> 30:39.340\n It was basically, it was basically standing beside the road\n\n30:39.340 --> 30:42.500\n with a sign and a bucket taking up collections\n\n30:42.500 --> 30:44.860\n for homeless shelters, for abused women,\n\n30:44.860 --> 30:47.540\n for children, stuff like that.\n\n30:47.540 --> 30:49.660\n Then later on, I branched off.\n\n30:49.660 --> 30:51.020\n When I started off on my own,\n\n30:51.020 --> 30:53.380\n I would set up my own charity company\n\n30:53.380 --> 30:55.140\n and do some telemarketing and go on by\n\n30:55.140 --> 30:57.100\n and collect checks and things like that.\n\n30:57.100 --> 30:58.140\n We're gonna talk about that.\n\n30:58.140 --> 30:59.860\n But actually, can we just step back\n\n30:59.860 --> 31:04.260\n and talk about your mom and your dad?\n\n31:04.260 --> 31:08.100\n Given all of that, given all the abuse,\n\n31:08.980 --> 31:12.300\n the complex ways that she played with love,\n\n31:12.300 --> 31:15.700\n to see how far she can push you and the people around her,\n\n31:15.700 --> 31:16.940\n and they still love her.\n\n31:18.220 --> 31:20.460\n Today, do you love her?\n\n31:20.460 --> 31:22.660\n You know, I called my dad yesterday.\n\n31:22.660 --> 31:24.500\n My dad, he's dying now.\n\n31:24.500 --> 31:25.500\n He's got a heart condition.\n\n31:25.500 --> 31:27.340\n He's not gonna get the operation to fix it.\n\n31:27.340 --> 31:29.220\n So he's like, fuck it, I'm ready to go.\n\n31:29.220 --> 31:30.420\n And I'm like, I looked at him,\n\n31:30.420 --> 31:32.660\n because hell, I'm 52 now.\n\n31:32.660 --> 31:35.180\n Prior to 52, I'd have been like, no, you need to do this.\n\n31:35.180 --> 31:38.340\n But I looked at him and I was like, I understand.\n\n31:38.340 --> 31:39.420\n I understand.\n\n31:39.420 --> 31:40.460\n You're done.\n\n31:40.460 --> 31:42.780\n And so he's not gonna get the operation.\n\n31:42.780 --> 31:44.220\n I was talking to him yesterday and he asked me,\n\n31:44.220 --> 31:45.780\n he's like, have you seen your mom?\n\n31:45.780 --> 31:47.100\n And I was like, dad, I've not talked to her\n\n31:47.100 --> 31:48.660\n for about two years.\n\n31:48.660 --> 31:52.620\n And I told him, I was like, I love my mom,\n\n31:52.620 --> 31:54.900\n but my mom is not a good person.\n\n31:54.900 --> 31:55.740\n She's not.\n\n31:55.740 --> 31:59.180\n And he told me, I was talking to him on the phone yesterday,\n\n31:59.180 --> 32:01.780\n and he told me that it took him several years\n\n32:01.780 --> 32:03.260\n to really understand that.\n\n32:03.260 --> 32:04.780\n You know, he loved her too,\n\n32:04.780 --> 32:07.460\n but it takes, when you're getting abused like that,\n\n32:07.460 --> 32:09.940\n especially my dad, my dad came from a good family,\n\n32:09.940 --> 32:13.300\n everything else, and, you know, upstanding family.\n\n32:13.300 --> 32:17.300\n And I think that when you're that victim of abuse,\n\n32:18.460 --> 32:20.300\n you know, you've never seen it before,\n\n32:20.300 --> 32:23.260\n you've never encountered it, and then it happens,\n\n32:23.260 --> 32:25.300\n well, you're like that frog in water all of a sudden.\n\n32:25.300 --> 32:28.260\n You know, you get to the point where it gradually increases\n\n32:28.260 --> 32:30.100\n until how do you get out of it?\n\n32:30.100 --> 32:32.820\n Everybody else sees what's happening, but you don't.\n\n32:32.820 --> 32:34.740\n I grew up in that environment though, you know,\n\n32:34.740 --> 32:39.060\n so it took me a long time to come to terms with that.\n\n32:39.060 --> 32:42.020\n My sister came to terms with it long before I did.\n\n32:42.020 --> 32:44.180\n You know, my sister, she's been a decade\n\n32:44.180 --> 32:45.860\n without talking to my mom,\n\n32:45.860 --> 32:48.380\n like she had tried to commit suicide, I didn't know that.\n\n32:48.380 --> 32:51.740\n What got me so bad is she said at one point\n\n32:51.740 --> 32:55.020\n that she always thought someone was gonna come in\n\n32:55.020 --> 32:58.180\n and save us, and my response, just immediate response,\n\n32:58.180 --> 32:59.900\n not even thinking about it, my response was,\n\n32:59.900 --> 33:02.500\n well, Denise, I knew no one ever was.\n\n33:02.500 --> 33:06.060\n And looking at things now,\n\n33:06.060 --> 33:09.420\n I think that's where our paths diverged.\n\n33:10.500 --> 33:13.220\n Me, it was, if you wanna do it,\n\n33:13.220 --> 33:14.500\n if anybody's gonna take care of you,\n\n33:14.500 --> 33:15.980\n you gotta take care of yourself.\n\n33:15.980 --> 33:16.820\n You're on your own.\n\n33:16.820 --> 33:20.140\n You're on your own, you know, it's up to you.\n\n33:20.140 --> 33:24.100\n And Denise has always been that child\n\n33:24.100 --> 33:27.780\n that has expected someone to come in and save her.\n\n33:27.780 --> 33:31.380\n Well, and almost like it's all going to be okay, somebody.\n\n33:31.380 --> 33:33.580\n Yeah, and I knew it wasn't.\n\n33:33.580 --> 33:34.420\n No, no, you go.\n\n33:34.420 --> 33:35.260\n Unless you.\n\n33:35.260 --> 33:38.460\n Unless you make it okay, it ain't gonna be okay.\n\n33:38.460 --> 33:40.820\n So, you know, I was.\n\n33:40.820 --> 33:45.220\n Are you able to forgive her, your mom?\n\n33:45.220 --> 33:49.580\n My boundary with my mom, the reason I've not spoken with her,\n\n33:49.580 --> 33:54.580\n over two years ago, I started this legal career of mine.\n\n33:55.780 --> 33:57.540\n I've been the guy who has,\n\n33:57.540 --> 34:01.420\n I spent a lot of time thinking about my past\n\n34:01.420 --> 34:04.260\n and those choices and what brought those choices around.\n\n34:04.260 --> 34:06.780\n So I'm big about taking responsibility for my actions.\n\n34:06.780 --> 34:07.620\n I truly am.\n\n34:07.620 --> 34:09.540\n I think it's really important you have to do that.\n\n34:09.540 --> 34:12.540\n Well, my mom, not so much.\n\n34:12.540 --> 34:14.740\n So I was talking to her, you know,\n\n34:14.740 --> 34:16.300\n and I would start saying, you know,\n\n34:16.300 --> 34:19.300\n she would start the conversation talking about,\n\n34:19.300 --> 34:20.260\n she didn't understand\n\n34:20.260 --> 34:22.300\n why Denise wouldn't speak to her anymore.\n\n34:22.300 --> 34:24.180\n That was one of her tropes.\n\n34:24.180 --> 34:26.020\n So, and my response started to become,\n\n34:26.020 --> 34:28.780\n well, because you were the abuser\n\n34:28.780 --> 34:31.100\n and you spent your life doing that to her.\n\n34:31.100 --> 34:34.340\n So it's more healthy for her not to talk to you.\n\n34:34.340 --> 34:37.900\n So she's still not able to see the flaws\n\n34:37.900 --> 34:40.140\n in her ways of the past.\n\n34:40.140 --> 34:41.140\n No, not at all.\n\n34:41.140 --> 34:44.660\n So my ultimatum to my mom was, look,\n\n34:44.660 --> 34:46.860\n when you're able to admit\n\n34:46.860 --> 34:49.980\n that you abused the people in your life,\n\n34:49.980 --> 34:51.460\n accept that responsibility\n\n34:51.460 --> 34:55.780\n and be able to discuss it with me, we'll have a talk.\n\n34:55.780 --> 34:58.500\n Other than that, I don't want to talk to you anymore.\n\n34:58.500 --> 35:00.500\n So for the first year it was, you know,\n\n35:00.500 --> 35:03.700\n calling, cussing my wife out, cussing me out,\n\n35:04.900 --> 35:07.580\n you know, I don't need you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n35:07.580 --> 35:09.580\n And then finally it started to taper off\n\n35:09.580 --> 35:12.260\n and she's never really contacted me after that point.\n\n35:12.260 --> 35:17.260\n And your dad is dying.\n\n35:18.020 --> 35:21.140\n What do you take from the way he's taken on death?\n\n35:21.140 --> 35:22.940\n Just saying, fuck it.\n\n35:22.940 --> 35:25.460\n You know, it's the man.\n\n35:25.460 --> 35:27.740\n And what have you learned from your dad?\n\n35:27.740 --> 35:30.100\n What do you love about your dad?\n\n35:30.100 --> 35:33.140\n He's one of these guys that, you know, like I told him,\n\n35:34.380 --> 35:37.700\n I told my dad about the abuse and everything else.\n\n35:37.700 --> 35:39.060\n And there was a point.\n\n35:39.060 --> 35:41.220\n So, you know, I told you about the elevator stuff,\n\n35:41.220 --> 35:43.660\n but before that, man, it was,\n\n35:44.900 --> 35:47.980\n it took me 40 years to talk about that,\n\n35:47.980 --> 35:51.980\n but it also took me 40 years to talk about,\n\n35:53.820 --> 35:58.820\n there was a point that my mom and dad would leave the house\n\n36:00.540 --> 36:02.420\n and I would urinate in the floor.\n\n36:03.780 --> 36:04.620\n All right.\n\n36:04.620 --> 36:05.900\n And...\n\n36:05.900 --> 36:09.300\n Is that like out of anger?\n\n36:09.300 --> 36:11.300\n No, no idea why.\n\n36:11.300 --> 36:12.140\n All right.\n\n36:12.140 --> 36:12.980\n But I would.\n\n36:12.980 --> 36:13.820\n Piss on the carpet.\n\n36:13.820 --> 36:15.900\n Carpet pissers like the Lebowski, right?\n\n36:18.260 --> 36:20.260\n It really tied the room together, dude.\n\n36:20.260 --> 36:22.100\n It really tied the room together.\n\n36:22.100 --> 36:22.940\n I was talking about that\n\n36:22.940 --> 36:26.700\n and this lady comes up to me after the presentation\n\n36:26.700 --> 36:29.500\n and she had a career previous to that\n\n36:29.500 --> 36:31.860\n where she dealt with abused kids.\n\n36:31.860 --> 36:32.780\n And she told me, she was like,\n\n36:32.780 --> 36:37.220\n Brett, she's like, it's a control mechanism.\n\n36:37.220 --> 36:40.060\n The only control you had was that.\n\n36:40.060 --> 36:42.180\n And she's like, kids do that.\n\n36:42.180 --> 36:43.500\n And I was like, so I'm not unique.\n\n36:43.500 --> 36:45.660\n She's like, no, you're not unique in that.\n\n36:45.660 --> 36:49.580\n So that, you know, this whole history of abuse,\n\n36:49.580 --> 36:51.780\n Denise dealt with it by drinking,\n\n36:51.780 --> 36:55.100\n by trying to commit suicide, things like that.\n\n36:55.100 --> 36:56.340\n And then finally she escapes.\n\n36:56.340 --> 36:57.180\n I'm the kid that didn't.\n\n36:57.180 --> 37:00.540\n And not only that, my wife pointed out to me that,\n\n37:00.540 --> 37:02.780\n again, it's that Eastern Kentucky mentality stuff.\n\n37:02.780 --> 37:04.780\n You know, the male's expected to do things.\n\n37:04.780 --> 37:08.660\n So with me, it was almost like I stepped up\n\n37:09.660 --> 37:12.180\n to take part in those crimes\n\n37:12.180 --> 37:14.580\n so that Denise didn't have to.\n\n37:14.580 --> 37:16.580\n And she was able to avoid all that.\n\n37:16.580 --> 37:18.140\n Other than that one shoplifting stuff,\n\n37:18.140 --> 37:19.940\n Denise doesn't break the law anymore.\n\n37:19.940 --> 37:22.820\n She goes off to be a, she's a good parent.\n\n37:22.820 --> 37:24.140\n She's an angry parent.\n\n37:24.140 --> 37:24.980\n She's a good parent.\n\n37:24.980 --> 37:27.700\n She's a teacher, a good citizen overall.\n\n37:27.700 --> 37:30.940\n I was just the guy that kept right on going with it.\n\n37:30.940 --> 37:31.780\n Kept on going.\n\n37:31.780 --> 37:32.980\n So let me ask you about that.\n\n37:32.980 --> 37:37.300\n So your life of cyber crime.\n\n37:37.300 --> 37:40.220\n In describing some of the things you did or knew about,\n\n37:40.220 --> 37:41.700\n you said, quote,\n\n37:41.700 --> 37:44.580\n \"'I once stole several thousand dollars worth of coins\n\n37:44.580 --> 37:47.140\n \"'from a family trying to sell them\n\n37:47.140 --> 37:48.820\n \"'to put a new roof on their home.\n\n37:48.820 --> 37:52.900\n \"'Another time, I sent a counterfeit cashier's check\n\n37:52.900 --> 37:55.980\n \"'to a victim and he ended up being arrested for it.\n\n37:55.980 --> 37:58.580\n \"'I lied to family, friends, everyone I knew.\n\n37:58.580 --> 38:01.100\n \"'I was a truly despicable person.'\"\n\n38:01.100 --> 38:02.340\n True.\n\n38:02.340 --> 38:05.100\n \"'One of my Ukrainian associates script\n\n38:05.100 --> 38:08.660\n \"'had someone who owed him money kidnapped

these stories that stand out to you\n\n38:23.900 --> 38:28.900\n that are particularly despicable or representative\n\n38:29.180 --> 38:31.580\n or interesting when you look back\n\n38:31.580 --> 38:36.260\n that defined your approach and who you were at that time?\n\n38:36.260 --> 38:41.260\n Let me say that I did not care about my victim, all right?\n\n38:41.940 --> 38:44.980\n I cared about me, is what I cared about.\n\n38:45.940 --> 38:47.900\n It's rough to admit that.\n\n38:50.140 --> 38:51.780\n You don't give a shit what you're doing to anybody else,\n\n38:51.780 --> 38:52.820\n you only care about you.\n\n38:52.820 --> 38:54.280\n But that's the truth of the matter.\n\n38:54.280 --> 38:56.480\n I didn't care about the victims.\n\n38:56.480 --> 39:00.740\n The lady, that wasn't even at the beginning of my career\n\n39:00.740 --> 39:03.060\n as a cyber criminal, that was right at the last of it.\n\n39:03.060 --> 39:03.900\n Which lady?\n\n39:03.900 --> 39:04.980\n The coin lady.\n\n39:05.900 --> 39:07.500\n By that point, Shadow Crew had made\n\n39:07.500 --> 39:10.580\n the front cover of Forbes, August of 04.\n\n39:10.580 --> 39:13.860\n October 26th of 04, Secret Service had shut us down,\n\n39:13.860 --> 39:16.900\n 33 people arrested, six countries in six hours.\n\n39:16.900 --> 39:19.740\n I was the guy that was publicly mentioned as getting away.\n\n39:20.620 --> 39:23.580\n What happened was is I was the guy who was,\n\n39:23.580 --> 39:25.700\n I had kind of invented this crime\n\n39:25.700 --> 39:27.860\n called tax return identity theft\n\n39:27.860 --> 39:30.980\n and was stealing a lot of money.\n\n39:30.980 --> 39:33.660\n I went through all my stateside savings\n\n39:33.660 --> 39:35.540\n and Shadow Crew gets shut down.\n\n39:35.540 --> 39:37.820\n I don't have any way to come in with any money,\n\n39:37.820 --> 39:40.940\n so I start running counterfeit cashier's checks,\n\n39:40.940 --> 39:42.380\n defrauding people with that,\n\n39:42.380 --> 39:45.840\n having them send products or bullion collections,\n\n39:45.840 --> 39:48.260\n what have you, by COD, collect on delivery,\n\n39:48.260 --> 39:49.300\n and I would pay with it\n\n39:49.300 --> 39:51.100\n with a counterfeit cashier's check.\n\n39:51.100 --> 39:54.060\n This lady was on eBay.\n\n39:54.060 --> 39:57.180\n She had been collecting these silver coins all of her life.\n\n39:57.180 --> 39:58.700\n You know, the U.S. currency used to be,\n\n39:58.700 --> 40:00.420\n the coins used to be silver,\n\n40:00.420 --> 40:02.620\n so she had a whole collection of these things,\n\n40:02.620 --> 40:05.580\n like, I don't know, 80, 90 pounds of this stuff,\n\n40:05.580 --> 40:09.180\n and I'm a very good social engineer.\n\n40:10.420 --> 40:13.780\n So, convinced her that I was a legitimate person,\n\n40:13.780 --> 40:16.060\n that, you know, hey, send it to COD,\n\n40:16.060 --> 40:18.700\n you can use my FedEx account to do that\n\n40:18.700 --> 40:20.580\n or my UPS account to do that.\n\n40:20.580 --> 40:23.460\n I'll pay with a cashier's check,\n\n40:23.460 --> 40:25.740\n you can take it in, same as cash.\n\n40:25.740 --> 40:28.740\n She believed that, she was, even on the ad,\n\n40:28.740 --> 40:30.460\n and we talked on the phone and everything else,\n\n40:30.460 --> 40:33.340\n she had told me that she was a single parent,\n\n40:33.340 --> 40:34.940\n and it was the only money that she had\n\n40:34.940 --> 40:39.460\n to put a roof on the house for her and her kids,\n\n40:39.460 --> 40:41.460\n and I didn't give a damn.\n\n40:41.460 --> 40:42.300\n I didn't give a damn.\n\n40:42.300 --> 40:44.420\n What was more important was me at that point.\n\n40:44.420 --> 40:46.380\n Can I ask you a question about the social engineering aspect?\n\n40:46.380 --> 40:50.820\n So maybe specifics like the methodology,\n\n40:50.820 --> 40:52.900\n email, you said phone,\n\n40:52.900 --> 40:57.900\n maybe you could discuss this process\n\n40:57.980 --> 41:00.300\n from a bigger philosophical perspective\n\n41:00.300 --> 41:03.540\n of what is it about human beings\n\n41:03.540 --> 41:06.580\n that makes it possible to be social engineer,\n\n41:06.580 --> 41:09.780\n to be victims of fraud?\n\n41:09.780 --> 41:14.780\n So, first let me say that I became a social engineer\n\n41:15.020 --> 41:20.020\n as a child, all right, because the adults in my environment,\n\n41:20.020 --> 41:23.300\n as a child, I had to know exactly what they were thinking\n\n41:23.300 --> 41:26.340\n and be able to try to manipulate that for survival.\n\n41:26.340 --> 41:30.740\n So I became a social engineer for survival initially,\n\n41:30.740 --> 41:32.500\n all right, and one of the things that I've seen\n\n41:32.500 --> 41:35.100\n with a lot of cyber criminals is the exact same thing.\n\n41:35.100 --> 41:37.300\n They're really expert ones.\n\n41:37.300 --> 41:38.980\n They become a social engineer as a child,\n\n41:38.980 --> 41:42.940\n then later on, they use those tools to victimize others.\n\n41:42.940 --> 41:44.740\n Which is fascinating because you're,\n\n41:44.740 --> 41:46.780\n in order to understand what others are thinking,\n\n41:46.780 --> 41:49.020\n you have to be extremely good at empathy.\n\n41:49.020 --> 41:51.500\n So you have to like really put yourself\n\n41:51.500 --> 41:53.300\n in the shoes of the other person.\n\n41:53.300 --> 41:56.540\n And yet, in order to do cyber crime,\n\n41:56.540 --> 42:00.740\n you have to not care about the pain\n\n42:00.740 --> 42:03.100\n that might cause them once you manipulate them.\n\n42:03.100 --> 42:06.860\n So you have to empathize and yet not care.\n\n42:06.860 --> 42:08.420\n Exactly, and I would argue,\n\n42:08.420 --> 42:11.260\n I would argue that that is not a sociopath\n\n42:11.260 --> 42:13.500\n because a cyber criminal, and I was no different,\n\n42:13.500 --> 42:15.860\n most cyber criminals justify those actions.\n\n42:15.860 --> 42:18.540\n So the justification becomes what's important.\n\n42:18.540 --> 42:21.380\n With me, the justification was why I did it for my family,\n\n42:21.380 --> 42:24.060\n did it for my wife, did it for my stripper girlfriend.\n\n42:24.060 --> 42:25.380\n So, and I believe those justifications.\n\n42:25.380 --> 42:26.220\n That's a good story, I heard that one.\n\n42:26.220 --> 42:27.060\n Yeah, so.\n\n42:27.060 --> 42:28.660\n I like that, because I care about love a lot.\n\n42:28.660 --> 42:33.660\n Yeah, so the big picture of that is trust.\n\n42:35.220 --> 42:40.220\n How do you establish trust with a potential victim?\n\n42:40.220 --> 42:42.540\n All right, now I would argue online\n\n42:42.540 --> 42:44.860\n that that trust is established through a combination\n\n42:44.860 --> 42:47.780\n of technology, tools, social engineering.\n\n42:47.780 --> 42:50.580\n All right, so we trust our tech.\n\n42:50.580 --> 42:53.340\n We trust our cell phones, we trust our laptops.\n\n42:53.340 --> 42:55.020\n A lot of times we don't understand how they operate,\n\n42:55.020 --> 42:56.980\n but we trust the news that comes across the line.\n\n42:56.980 --> 42:59.420\n We trust the phone numbers that show up.\n\n42:59.420 --> 43:02.340\n We trust IP addresses if we're advanced enough\n\n43:02.340 --> 43:04.060\n to look at an IP address or a domain\n\n43:04.060 --> 43:05.460\n or anything else like that.\n\n43:05.460 --> 43:07.580\n Criminals use tools to manipulate that,\n\n43:07.580 --> 43:10.220\n spoof phone numbers, spoof browser fingerprints,\n\n43:11.500 --> 43:14.060\n whatever that may be, whatever the tool may be.\n\n43:14.060 --> 43:16.540\n Then that lays a base level of trust.\n\n43:16.540 --> 43:19.820\n At that point, you shoot in with the social engineering\n\n43:19.820 --> 43:22.420\n and lay whatever story that is in order to manipulate\n\n43:22.420 --> 43:25.060\n that victim to act not out of reason,\n\n43:25.060 --> 43:27.740\n but out of emotion all of a sudden.\n\n43:27.740 --> 43:30.380\n This is fascinating about the way humans interact\n\n43:31.540 --> 43:34.620\n with the world, which is you're almost too afraid\n\n43:34.620 --> 43:35.460\n to not trust the world.\n\n43:35.460 --> 43:36.420\n You have to find a balance.\n\n43:36.420 --> 43:40.380\n You have a lot of conspiracy theories now\n\n43:40.380 --> 43:42.620\n about distrusting institutions and thinking\n\n43:42.620 --> 43:44.060\n like everything around us.\n\n43:44.060 --> 43:46.300\n It's like I've been listening to people\n\n43:46.300 --> 43:48.300\n who believe the earth is flat.\n\n43:48.300 --> 43:52.020\n And that conspiracy theory is fascinating to me\n\n43:52.020 --> 43:57.020\n because it basically says that you can't trust anybody.\n\n43:57.740 --> 44:00.460\n Like everything you hear is a lie.\n\n44:00.460 --> 44:03.300\n So that's one, you can live that life\n\n44:03.300 --> 44:04.340\n or you can live a life\n\n44:04.340 --> 44:06.820\n where you're just naively trusting everything.\n\n44:06.820 --> 44:08.220\n And we as humans have to,\n\n44:08.220 --> 44:11.660\n because that life is kind of full of happiness\n\n44:11.660 --> 44:13.260\n if nobody screws you over.\n\n44:13.260 --> 44:16.620\n Cause you meet people with the joyful heart\n\n44:16.620 --> 44:18.780\n and you get excited and all that kind of stuff.\n\n44:18.780 --> 44:21.980\n But if you do that too much, you're gonna get burned.\n\n44:21.980 --> 44:23.780\n So you have to find some kind of balance\n\n44:23.780 --> 44:28.740\n in terms of optimizing happiness where you trust,\n\n44:28.740 --> 44:32.020\n I mean, but verify and on the internet\n\n44:32.020 --> 44:34.300\n that becomes really tricky.\n\n44:34.300 --> 44:36.020\n You're almost too afraid to distrust everything\n\n44:36.020 --> 44:38.820\n cause you'll never get anything done on the internet.\n\n44:38.820 --> 44:41.220\n But then if you trust too much, you can get screwed over.\n\n44:41.220 --> 44:45.100\n And so the social engineering comes in where you're like,\n\n44:45.100 --> 44:47.620\n I'm not sure if I should trust this.\n\n44:47.620 --> 44:50.620\n You kind of help them build the narrative\n\n44:50.620 --> 44:51.620\n where it's like, it's good.\n\n44:51.620 --> 44:52.460\n It's good.\n\n44:52.460 --> 44:53.300\n It's good.\n\n44:53.300 --> 44:55.660\n So in a lot of the times that social engineering\n\n44:55.660 --> 45:00.660\n is just feeding into what the victim wants to believe.\n\n45:00.740 --> 45:01.580\n All right.\n\n45:01.580 --> 45:03.620\n It's not really coming up with a brand new story at all.\n\n45:03.620 --> 45:05.380\n It's just knowing what that victim is,\n\n45:05.380 --> 45:07.420\n what the motivations of that victim is\n\n45:07.420 --> 45:08.940\n feeding into it at that point.\n\n45:08.940 --> 45:10.220\n So you have to, again,\n\n45:10.220 --> 45:14.060\n that social engineer has to almost immediately know\n\n45:14.060 --> 45:16.300\n what's driving that person that they're talking about.\n\n45:16.300 --> 45:18.060\n If I'm working on a phone,\n\n45:18.060 --> 45:19.380\n talking to someone over the phone,\n\n45:19.380 --> 45:22.300\n I have to know within seconds what I need to say,\n\n45:22.300 --> 45:23.820\n how I need to act to interact\n\n45:23.820 --> 45:25.820\n with that customer service agent\n\n45:25.820 --> 45:28.100\n or whoever I'm talking to on the other end of the line.\n\n45:28.100 --> 45:31.220\n So fascinating because you truly are empathizing\n\n45:31.220 --> 45:32.220\n with the other person.\n\n45:32.220 --> 45:33.300\n Absolutely.\n\n45:33.300 --> 45:34.140\n Who is it?\n\n45:34.140 --> 45:36.580\n This business man, Steven Schwarzman.\n\n45:36.580 --> 45:40.380\n And I've talked to a few times.\n\n45:40.380 --> 45:42.100\n He mentioned this thing that,\n\n45:44.020 --> 45:45.780\n the way you build deep relationships\n\n45:45.780 --> 45:49.020\n is you really kind of notice\n\n45:49.020 --> 45:51.220\n the things that people are telling you.\n\n45:51.220 --> 45:56.140\n Like what they want and what they're bothered by,\n\n45:56.140 --> 45:58.300\n what are their big problems in their lives?\n\n45:58.300 --> 46:00.900\n Because everybody's saying that all the time\n\n46:00.900 --> 46:02.540\n and most of us are just ignoring it.\n\n46:02.540 --> 46:03.380\n Right.\n\n46:03.380 --> 46:05.420\n But if you take the time to listen,\n\n46:05.420 --> 46:07.060\n you know somebody at that point.\n\n46:07.060 --> 46:07.900\n Yeah.\n\n46:07.900 --> 46:08.740\n Absolutely you do.\n\n46:08.740 --> 46:10.820\n Then you have to be able to dismiss it.\n\n46:10.820 --> 46:12.780\n You have to dismiss it after.\n\n46:12.780 --> 46:14.020\n You're looking for that just to see\n\n46:14.020 --> 46:17.020\n how I can manipulate that is what you're trying to do.\n\n46:17.020 --> 46:20.340\n So the lady was one story,\n\n46:20.340 --> 46:22.020\n another truly despicable story.\n\n46:22.020 --> 46:23.900\n We'll get to script in a second.\n\n46:23.900 --> 46:25.700\n But another truly despicable story.\n\n46:25.700 --> 46:28.900\n We were one of the really first groups\n\n46:28.900 --> 46:30.700\n that started phishing attacks.\n\n46:30.700 --> 46:31.540\n What's phishing?\n\n46:31.540 --> 46:33.580\n So that is a social engineering attack.\n\n46:33.580 --> 46:34.580\n PH by the way.\n\n46:34.580 --> 46:35.420\n Yeah, PH.\n\n46:35.420 --> 46:36.780\n That's another social engineering attack.\n\n46:36.780 --> 46:38.900\n That's sending that fake email out\n\n46:38.900 --> 46:40.580\n that looks like it's coming from a website\n\n46:40.580 --> 46:42.380\n or your financial organization or whatever\n\n46:42.380 --> 46:44.340\n and saying, hey, we've got a security problem.\n\n46:44.340 --> 46:46.980\n We need you to update your account information.\n\n46:46.980 --> 46:50.540\n Well, back then no one had ever seen a phishing attack.\n\n46:50.540 --> 46:53.280\n So you could ask for all the information.\n\n46:53.280 --> 46:56.240\n You were getting just complete identity profiles\n\n46:56.240 --> 46:57.380\n on a phishing email.\n\n46:57.380 --> 46:58.340\n Nowadays you can't do that.\n\n46:58.340 --> 47:00.160\n Nowadays you look for basically credentials\n\n47:00.160 --> 47:02.020\n because everyone is aware of phishing.\n\n47:02.020 --> 47:03.860\n But back then it was complete information.\n\n47:03.860 --> 47:08.420\n We had phished out, I don't know, 200,000 eTrade accounts.\n\n47:08.420 --> 47:10.060\n That's what we had the login credentials for.\n\n47:10.060 --> 47:11.180\n The login password, yeah.\n\n47:11.180 --> 47:13.900\n Login password, complete social, date of birth,\n\n47:13.900 --> 47:17.740\n mother's maiden account information, everything else.\n\n47:17.740 --> 47:20.380\n So we had access to those eTrade accounts.\n\n47:20.380 --> 47:24.180\n eTrade initially had no security in place.\n\n47:24.180 --> 47:26.180\n So you could cash out the account,\n\n47:26.180 --> 47:29.940\n ACH the money out to whatever account you wanted to,\n\n47:29.940 --> 47:31.540\n went through just fine.\n\n47:31.540 --> 47:34.900\n Made them alive on that for four to six months.\n\n47:34.900 --> 47:38.380\n eTrade got to the point where you couldn't\n\n47:38.380 --> 47:41.260\n do any ACH coming out.\n\n47:41.260 --> 47:42.780\n They locked everything down.\n\n47:42.780 --> 47:46.380\n Well, you're still sitting on thousands of eTrade accounts.\n\n47:46.380 --> 47:47.660\n How do you make money on that?\n\n47:50.540 --> 47:51.580\n That's a good question.\n\n47:51.580 --> 47:53.580\n So what you do is you find some fat cat that's\n\n47:53.580 --> 47:57.220\n got his retirement invested in blue chips.\n\n47:57.220 --> 47:59.420\n Same time you find a penny stock,\n\n47:59.420 --> 48:03.060\n you open up a brand new account, buy into that penny stock,\n\n48:03.060 --> 48:06.460\n cash the fat cat out, buy into that same penny stock,\n\n48:06.460 --> 48:08.140\n bump and dump schemes all of a sudden.\n\n48:08.140 --> 48:11.020\n So you're destroying people's retirement accounts\n\n48:11.020 --> 48:12.940\n for just a few thousand dollars.\n\n48:12.940 --> 48:14.020\n Bam, bam, bam.\n\n48:14.020 --> 48:17.620\n And of course, eTrade's response is, not our problem.\n\n48:17.620 --> 48:18.500\n It's your problem.\n\n48:18.500 --> 48:19.900\n You shouldn't give up your password\n\n48:19.900 --> 48:21.500\n or what have you at that point.\n\n48:21.500 --> 48:24.020\n And you still see that issue today with Zelle scams\n\n48:24.020 --> 48:25.380\n and things like that.\n\n48:25.380 --> 48:26.300\n Which scam?\n\n48:26.300 --> 48:26.940\n Zelle.\n\n48:26.940 --> 48:28.620\n So you know, the instant payment that they have.\n\n48:28.620 --> 48:29.900\n So it's the same kind of operation,\n\n48:29.900 --> 48:32.300\n same type of difference with different payment mechanisms.\n\n48:32.300 --> 48:35.460\n You find an easy way to exploit a system,\n\n48:35.460 --> 48:39.100\n and typically the financial organization, not our problem.\n\n48:39.100 --> 48:41.780\n Our system's secure, it's the humans, it's their errors.\n\n48:41.780 --> 48:43.780\n Well, not really.\n\n48:43.780 --> 48:45.940\n You know, you've got some culpability in that,\n\n48:45.940 --> 48:49.380\n and you're just trying to avoid paying the part of the bill\n\n48:49.380 --> 48:50.220\n is what's going on.\n\n48:50.220 --> 48:52.500\n One of the things, just to stand fishing for a bit,\n\n48:52.500 --> 48:57.420\n is it really makes me sad because there's been people\n\n48:57.420 --> 49:00.660\n on all kinds of platforms, including YouTube comments,\n\n49:00.660 --> 49:02.220\n but emails too.\n\n49:02.220 --> 49:04.660\n They figured out emails somehow.\n\n49:04.660 --> 49:11.620\n So people are now seeing the followers\n\n49:11.620 --> 49:13.940\n of this particular podcast who are fans,\n\n49:13.940 --> 49:18.060\n they're finding them on platforms like LinkedIn and YouTube\n\n49:18.060 --> 49:20.820\n and so on, and they are figuring out\n\n49:20.820 --> 49:24.980\n ways to get to those people by another channel, which\n\n49:24.980 --> 49:29.620\n I suppose seems more authentic to those people.\n\n49:29.620 --> 49:34.700\n So they send them an email from what looks like me,\n\n49:34.700 --> 49:37.980\n and with this kind of loving message.\n\n49:37.980 --> 49:39.780\n The interesting thing, the emails\n\n49:39.780 --> 49:41.900\n sound like something I would write.\n\n49:41.900 --> 49:44.580\n So these aren't even, at this stage, it's not even,\n\n49:44.580 --> 49:46.180\n it doesn't feel automated.\n\n49:46.180 --> 49:49.900\n Or if it's automated, there's a human in the loop\n\n49:49.900 --> 49:52.540\n that's really fine tuning it to a specific,\n\n49:52.540 --> 49:53.980\n or maybe I'm very predictable.\n\n49:53.980 --> 49:58.340\n But it's very loving in the way I would write that message.\n\n49:58.340 --> 49:59.900\n So think about that, all right?\n\n49:59.900 --> 50:02.100\n So when Phishing first comes out,\n\n50:02.100 --> 50:04.740\n you could look at the language of the text or the website\n\n50:04.740 --> 50:07.940\n and say, eh, if you were paying attention, that's so OK.\n\n50:07.940 --> 50:11.340\n So that's not an English speaker who wrote that, typically.\n\n50:11.340 --> 50:15.060\n But as time has went on, as the awareness of what a Phishing\n\n50:15.060 --> 50:17.500\n attack looks like, we have people\n\n50:17.500 --> 50:19.380\n that are sitting down now and making sure\n\n50:19.380 --> 50:20.740\n that the language is proper.\n\n50:20.740 --> 50:22.060\n It gets worse than that, though.\n\n50:22.060 --> 50:24.260\n If you look at business email compromise,\n\n50:24.260 --> 50:26.820\n so the way a business email compromise typically works\n\n50:26.820 --> 50:31.580\n is the attacker will find a payroll person, find a CEO.\n\n50:31.580 --> 50:34.300\n He will fashion a spear phishing email, which\n\n50:34.300 --> 50:36.700\n is that's a Phishing attack that's targeting\n\n50:36.700 --> 50:38.980\n one specific individual.\n\n50:38.980 --> 50:40.740\n So he'll fashion a spear phishing email.\n\n50:40.740 --> 50:43.860\n And the way he does that is he pulls all the information\n\n50:43.860 --> 50:49.180\n he possibly can on that person, that CEO.\n\n50:49.180 --> 50:55.940\n Maybe he'll spear that CEO just to get their login credentials\n\n50:55.940 --> 50:58.180\n to their email, just to read the emails.\n\n50:58.180 --> 50:59.700\n And he'll go in there, and he'll start\n\n50:59.700 --> 51:01.220\n reading all these emails.\n\n51:01.220 --> 51:04.340\n He'll specifically read the emails to the payroll\n\n51:04.340 --> 51:06.140\n department, see what that relationship is.\n\n51:06.140 --> 51:07.580\n Are they talking about their kids,\n\n51:07.580 --> 51:09.500\n talking about relationships, talking about vacation?\n\n51:09.500 --> 51:10.500\n What are they talking about?\n\n51:10.500 --> 51:11.340\n How are they talking?\n\n51:11.340 --> 51:12.300\n Are they friendly?\n\n51:12.300 --> 51:13.300\n Are they sterile?\n\n51:13.300 --> 51:15.060\n What are they doing, all right?\n\n51:15.060 --> 51:17.060\n So then he decides, well, I'm going to go ahead\n\n51:17.060 --> 51:20.020\n and spear phish the payroll department as well.\n\n51:20.020 --> 51:22.540\n So then he spear phishes in, gets those credentials.\n\n51:22.540 --> 51:25.700\n At the same time, he creates a Unicode domain\n\n51:25.700 --> 51:27.740\n in whatever the company name is, all right?\n\n51:27.740 --> 51:29.780\n So instead of that English alphabet I,\n\n51:29.780 --> 51:32.220\n he's got that Russian letter that looks like an I\n\n51:32.220 --> 51:35.260\n but without the dot on top, all right?\n\n51:35.260 --> 51:38.340\n Comes back into the email, into the payroll email,\n\n51:38.340 --> 51:42.780\n blocks the real CEO's email, replaces that with the Unicode\n\n51:42.780 --> 51:47.620\n email that he's got, and then sends out a message\n\n51:47.620 --> 51:50.340\n using the correct language, the correct relationships,\n\n51:50.340 --> 51:52.700\n everything else, and says, hey, we're updating\n\n51:52.700 --> 51:55.140\n our account status, I need you to send this payment\n\n51:55.140 --> 51:58.100\n instead of over here, they've set up a new account,\n\n51:58.100 --> 51:59.860\n send all payments over here now.\n\n51:59.860 --> 52:02.620\n And that is business email compromise in a nutshell,\n\n52:02.620 --> 52:04.460\n all right, works great.\n\n52:04.460 --> 52:06.580\n Probably the larger the organization,\n\n52:06.580 --> 52:10.140\n the more susceptible to that kind of attack\n\n52:10.140 --> 52:14.820\n because there's like a distribution of responsibility\n\n52:14.820 --> 52:16.900\n to where you're more likely to believe that,\n\n52:16.900 --> 52:18.980\n okay, this other person is responsible,\n\n52:18.980 --> 52:21.420\n I'm sure they secured everything.\n\n52:21.420 --> 52:23.180\n I'm okay listening to this.\n\n52:24.260 --> 52:25.940\n So that's business email compromise,\n\n52:25.940 --> 52:27.780\n and those crimes, and that's one of the things\n\n52:27.780 --> 52:28.820\n you see about cybercrime.\n\n52:28.820 --> 52:30.820\n Cybercrime's not really sophisticated.\n\n52:30.820 --> 52:32.900\n It's not, the attacks are not sophisticated.\n\n52:32.900 --> 52:37.900\n The stat is 90% of every single attack uses a known exploit.\n\n52:37.900 --> 52:41.380\n It's not zero day attacks, they're out there,\n\n52:41.380 --> 52:43.620\n but if you're a criminal waiting on a zero day to profit,\n\n52:43.620 --> 52:45.420\n you're gonna starve to death.\n\n52:45.420 --> 52:50.420\n The meat and potatoes are that 90%, known exploits.\n\n52:50.460 --> 52:54.020\n And then the rest is, well, you're saying it's,\n\n52:54.020 --> 52:56.820\n maybe you mean it's not technically sophisticated,\n\n52:56.820 --> 52:59.060\n but it's social engineering sophisticated.\n\n52:59.060 --> 53:01.340\n Very sophisticated on that end, very sophisticated.\n\n53:01.340 --> 53:03.380\n I mean, it's a fascinating study of that.\n\n53:03.380 --> 53:06.780\n That establishment of trust and then using that trust\n\n53:06.780 --> 53:09.460\n to defraud that victim.\n\n53:09.460 --> 53:11.300\n That is something.\n\n53:11.300 --> 53:14.380\n I wish, obviously, all of these folks\n\n53:14.380 --> 53:16.740\n are really good at hiding.\n\n53:16.740 --> 53:19.460\n I wish you could tell their stories in a way,\n\n53:19.460 --> 53:21.020\n which is why you're fascinating,\n\n53:21.020 --> 53:22.820\n is you're able to tell these stories now,\n\n53:22.820 --> 53:27.820\n because it is studying human nature by exploiting it,\n\n53:28.180 --> 53:30.260\n but you get to understand our weak points,\n\n53:30.260 --> 53:35.060\n our hope, our desire to trust others.\n\n53:35.060 --> 53:40.060\n Also, the weak points and the failures of digital systems\n\n53:42.900 --> 53:46.020\n and at scale, humans have to connect.\n\n53:46.020 --> 53:46.860\n It's fascinating.\n\n53:46.860 --> 53:50.920\n This is a weird question, asking for a friend.\n\n53:52.700 --> 53:54.860\n Is spear phishing itself illegal?\n\n53:54.860 --> 53:56.260\n What's the legality here?\n\n53:56.260 --> 53:57.140\n Oh, it's all illegal.\n\n53:57.140 --> 53:58.220\n Absolutely it is.\n\n53:58.220 --> 53:59.060\n Is it?\n\n53:59.060 --> 53:59.900\n Absolutely.\n\n53:59.900 --> 54:02.460\n So here's what, okay, let me construct an example.\n\n54:02.460 --> 54:07.460\n So if my friend were to spear phish like a CEO, right,\n\n54:10.620 --> 54:14.560\n and get their information and after they get control,\n\n54:14.560 --> 54:16.220\n say, of their Twitter account,\n\n54:16.220 --> 54:21.220\n they tweet something loving and positive, what's the crime?\n\n54:21.900 --> 54:23.700\n Unauthorized access of advice.\n\n54:23.700 --> 54:27.580\n What will be the punishment, do you think?\n\n54:27.580 --> 54:29.100\n That becomes questionable.\n\n54:29.100 --> 54:33.020\n So no monetary loss, or was there a monetary loss?\n\n54:33.020 --> 54:34.740\n Probably not, all right?\n\n54:34.740 --> 54:37.140\n So you have to figure out who the victim is\n\n54:37.140 --> 54:38.200\n before charges are pressed.\n\n54:38.200 --> 54:42.140\n Now, the crime would be unauthorized access, all right?\n\n54:42.140 --> 54:45.300\n But no real victim on that,\n\n54:45.300 --> 54:48.260\n unless the person whose account you took over\n\n54:48.260 --> 54:50.820\n takes exception to that.\n\n54:51.860 --> 54:53.060\n No monetary loss.\n\n54:53.060 --> 54:55.140\n So there's not really standard fines.\n\n54:55.140 --> 54:56.880\n Probably nothing's gonna happen, right.\n\n54:56.880 --> 54:57.720\n Right, right.\n\n54:57.720 --> 54:59.900\n So, I mean, that's kind of interesting,\n\n54:59.900 --> 55:04.280\n because it's, so when I got the ransomware,\n\n55:04.280 --> 55:07.720\n when I got the zero day attack on the QNAP mass,\n\n55:09.920 --> 55:14.920\n they basically say the criminal is QNAP, the company,\n\n55:17.580 --> 55:20.720\n for having so many security vulnerabilities.\n\n55:20.720 --> 55:25.720\n They're like, you are the victim of QNAP's incompetence.\n\n55:25.720 --> 55:27.880\n That's the way they kind of phrase it.\n\n55:27.880 --> 55:30.080\n And see, I don't agree with that.\n\n55:30.080 --> 55:31.920\n I don't agree with that at all.\n\n55:31.920 --> 55:33.760\n So, SolarWinds.\n\n55:33.760 --> 55:34.600\n Yeah.\n\n55:34.600 --> 55:39.600\n Let's, so I've got 130 page class action lawsuit\n\n55:41.200 --> 55:43.120\n printed out at the house, I've been going through it,\n\n55:43.120 --> 55:47.200\n that catalogs how SolarWinds lied for years\n\n55:47.200 --> 55:49.760\n about their vulnerabilities, and they lied to investors.\n\n55:49.760 --> 55:53.720\n The people who came in, the honorees who they would hire,\n\n55:53.720 --> 55:57.040\n would, you know, they would not pay attention to them\n\n55:57.040 --> 55:58.600\n when they said, you know, you've got these issues,\n\n55:58.600 --> 56:01.560\n they would say, go away, shit like that for years,\n\n56:01.560 --> 56:04.880\n until SolarWinds, you know, the attacks become apparent.\n\n56:07.160 --> 56:10.960\n My view on that is that the only person\n\n56:10.960 --> 56:14.040\n responsible for the crime are the criminals\n\n56:14.040 --> 56:18.000\n who did the attacking, the actual criminals, not SolarWinds.\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:21.400\n Now, does that mean that SolarWinds isn't all fucked up?\n\n56:21.400 --> 56:25.560\n They are, and there needs to be some accounting in place.\n\n56:25.560 --> 56:29.400\n But the only individual, the only people responsible\n\n56:29.400 --> 56:33.680\n for crime are the criminals, and that's either online,\n\n56:33.680 --> 56:36.520\n in the physical world, what have you.\n\n56:36.520 --> 56:39.800\n Being an idiot is not a crime.\n\n56:39.800 --> 56:40.640\n Not a crime.\n\n56:40.640 --> 56:45.200\n You know, being criminally negligent is,\n\n56:45.200 --> 56:48.640\n and I think that SolarWinds is certainly responsible,\n\n56:48.640 --> 56:52.240\n not responsible, they're culpable for what happened.\n\n56:52.240 --> 56:55.360\n Can you actually tell folks about SolarWinds?\n\n56:55.360 --> 56:59.600\n What is it, what are some interesting things\n\n56:59.600 --> 57:00.440\n that you're aware of?\n\n57:00.440 --> 57:05.440\n SolarWinds was very, it provided a backbone of security\n\n57:05.760 --> 57:10.760\n for hundreds, thousands of different companies.\n\n57:12.360 --> 57:14.440\n If you looked at, a lot of security companies\n\n57:14.440 --> 57:16.360\n were using SolarWinds that would allow you\n\n57:16.360 --> 57:19.040\n to get a snapshot of the entire system\n\n57:19.040 --> 57:20.400\n that they were working on.\n\n57:20.400 --> 57:24.400\n So what happens is, is you get a Russian group that comes in\n\n57:24.400 --> 57:29.400\n and they basically, they hack into SolarWinds\n\n57:29.560 --> 57:31.680\n and get access to it, and it allows them\n\n57:31.680 --> 57:36.680\n to view every single thing, I mean, every single thing\n\n57:37.240 --> 57:42.240\n about every single client that SolarWinds had at that point.\n\n57:42.240 --> 57:46.000\n So entire snapshots of all the IP that was going on,\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:47.920\n all the emails, all the communications,\n\n57:47.920 --> 57:50.920\n every single secret that was going on with those companies.\n\n57:50.920 --> 57:53.640\n If a company had software like Microsoft,\n\n57:53.640 --> 57:55.720\n it allowed them to look at the source code\n\n57:55.720 --> 57:57.240\n of everything that was going on.\n\n57:57.240 --> 58:01.080\n I mean, it's just a complete and total nightmare, all right?\n\n58:01.080 --> 58:05.960\n And something that you are not going to recover from.\n\n58:05.960 --> 58:07.280\n You're not.\n\n58:07.280 --> 58:08.960\n I mean, it's done at that point.\n\n58:08.960 --> 58:12.480\n You know, there's not been a lot of news lately about it,\n\n58:12.480 --> 58:15.120\n but the fact of the matter is, is that's the type of attack\n\n58:15.120 --> 58:16.920\n that's a catastrophic attack.\n\n58:16.920 --> 58:19.840\n So there's a huge amount of information\n\n58:19.840 --> 58:22.720\n that was read, saved elsewhere probably.\n\n58:22.720 --> 58:23.560\n Oh yeah.\n\n58:23.560 --> 58:26.280\n And so now there's people sitting on information.\n\n58:26.280 --> 58:27.120\n Absolutely.\n\n58:27.120 --> 58:28.600\n So think about one of the attack vectors\n\n58:28.600 --> 58:32.800\n has been Microsoft Outlook 365, things like that.\n\n58:32.800 --> 58:34.320\n This allowed the attackers to look\n\n58:34.320 --> 58:36.400\n at the source codes of that.\n\n58:36.400 --> 58:39.240\n So they have the source code now,\n\n58:39.240 --> 58:41.520\n so they go through it line by line.\n\n58:41.520 --> 58:42.560\n Where are the vulnerabilities?\n\n58:42.560 --> 58:44.600\n Let's find new vulnerabilities, new zero days.\n\n58:44.600 --> 58:46.520\n You know, I said zero days aren't common,\n\n58:46.520 --> 58:49.000\n but this opens up an entire new threat surface\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:50.000\n all of a sudden.\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:52.480\n So it's a completely catastrophic attack.\n\n58:52.480 --> 58:54.800\n Once all the chips are down, everything's tallied up,\n\n58:54.800 --> 58:56.760\n people are going to be like, yeah, we're done.\n\n58:56.760 --> 58:57.600\n We're done.\n\n58:57.600 --> 58:58.440\n Yeah.\n\n58:58.440 --> 59:02.800\n All right, this whole computer thing,\n\n59:02.800 --> 59:04.840\n we tried it and we're walking away.\n\n59:04.840 --> 59:05.680\n We're done.\n\n59:05.680 --> 59:07.560\n That's terrifying.\n\n59:07.560 --> 59:11.680\n So you're saying that there's not been obvious\n\n59:11.680 --> 59:14.720\n big negative impact from that yet.\n\n59:14.720 --> 59:15.560\n So, but like.\n\n59:15.560 --> 59:16.920\n There's been a lot of negative impact,\n\n59:16.920 --> 59:18.320\n but we're just starting.\n\n59:18.320 --> 59:19.160\n Right.\n\n59:19.160 --> 59:22.520\n So the capacity for destruction is huge here.\n\n59:22.520 --> 59:24.600\n How much involvement from nation states\n\n59:24.600 --> 59:26.640\n do you think there is on this?\n\n59:26.640 --> 59:28.000\n You know, it's interesting.\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:31.680\n So you've got Iran, you've got North Korea,\n\n59:31.680 --> 59:33.240\n China, Russia, you got the big four.\n\n59:33.240 --> 59:35.440\n You also got Brazil.\n\n59:35.440 --> 59:36.680\n You've got all these other countries\n\n59:36.680 --> 59:39.080\n that are interested in the United States as well.\n\n59:40.600 --> 59:42.120\n Nation states are interesting\n\n59:42.120 --> 59:44.440\n depending on who the nation state is.\n\n59:44.440 --> 59:46.240\n All right, so Russia is very good about working\n\n59:46.240 --> 59:48.240\n with the type of criminal that I used to be.\n\n59:48.240 --> 59:49.960\n You know, they'll enlist these guys\n\n59:49.960 --> 59:51.880\n and steal information or what have you,\n\n59:51.880 --> 59:54.080\n then Russia will take the information they want to,\n\n59:54.080 --> 59:56.640\n and they'll basically go off and sell whatever you want to\n\n59:56.640 --> 59:58.280\n and make some money.\n\n59:58.280 --> 1:00:00.320\n China's all about IP.\n\n1:00:01.160 --> 1:00:02.480\n North Korea is about stealing money\n\n1:00:02.480 --> 1:00:03.320\n because they really don't know\n\n1:00:03.320 --> 1:00:07.200\n what the hell else to do right now, but...\n\n1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:09.480\n So North Korea is actively involved in cybercrime.\n\n1:00:09.480 --> 1:00:10.360\n Absolutely.\n\n1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:13.320\n They've stolen a shitload of Bitcoin, everything else.\n\n1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:16.640\n So absolutely, they're actively involved with that.\n\n1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:19.120\n Very, very skilled attackers, very skilled.\n\n1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:20.160\n But even if you look at, you know,\n\n1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:23.560\n I told you that stat about 90%, all right?\n\n1:00:23.560 --> 1:00:25.920\n So even though SolarWinds is going to be\n\n1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:29.320\n the number one attack,\n\n1:00:29.320 --> 1:00:33.040\n the followup to that is this NotPetya attack that happened.\n\n1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:35.680\n And so that was the most sophisticated attack\n\n1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:38.200\n launched by the Russian Sandworm Group\n\n1:00:38.200 --> 1:00:40.920\n using all known exploits throughout.\n\n1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:42.960\n So it's not, again, it's not...\n\n1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:45.320\n You're right in the sophistication\n\n1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:47.880\n is typically not technical sophistication,\n\n1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:50.120\n but it's a social engineering sophistication.\n\n1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:52.200\n How do you get these things put together\n\n1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:54.320\n in line to attack and succeed?\n\n1:00:55.360 --> 1:00:57.320\n But when you get access to the source code,\n\n1:00:57.320 --> 1:00:59.560\n that's where technical sophistication could really do\n\n1:00:59.560 --> 1:01:00.400\n a lot of damage.\n\n1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:02.760\n And that's when you find out real quick,\n\n1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:05.440\n that's what separates the men from the boys in this game.\n\n1:01:05.440 --> 1:01:07.160\n All right, because all of a sudden it's not,\n\n1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:09.000\n I don't have to worry about social engineering.\n\n1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.800\n I've got source codes and I've got professionals\n\n1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:13.280\n that are looking at that.\n\n1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:14.480\n And that's your ass.\n\n1:01:15.520 --> 1:01:18.320\n Which then enables probably even more powerful\n\n1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:20.200\n social engineering methods too.\n\n1:01:20.200 --> 1:01:22.120\n I mean, it's just the cascade of...\n\n1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:26.480\n Is this terrifying to you, by the way?\n\n1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:29.760\n That this world that we're living in,\n\n1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:34.760\n as we put more and more of ourselves on the internet,\n\n1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:38.720\n into the metaverse, that there's so many more\n\n1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:40.680\n attack vectors on our wellbeing?\n\n1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:45.240\n What's terrifying to me, I used to preach it on Shadow Crew,\n\n1:01:45.240 --> 1:01:49.640\n is the idea that the perception of truth\n\n1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:52.320\n is more important than the truth itself.\n\n1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:53.920\n It doesn't matter what the facts are,\n\n1:01:53.920 --> 1:01:56.640\n it matters what I can convince you of.\n\n1:01:56.640 --> 1:01:58.680\n That's what's terrifying to me.\n\n1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:02.000\n So you look at deep fakes, you look at fake news,\n\n1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:03.760\n all this stuff that's going out,\n\n1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:06.000\n that becomes truly terrifying.\n\n1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:11.960\n Maybe there's an angle where it's freeing,\n\n1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:15.720\n if nothing is true and you can't trust anything.\n\n1:02:15.720 --> 1:02:20.640\n But you see, we as human beings, we wanna trust.\n\n1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:22.800\n We do, we need human interaction.\n\n1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:24.920\n And for that human interaction,\n\n1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:27.000\n you have to have a degree of trust.\n\n1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:31.920\n But it's more like you let go of an idea of absolute truth\n\n1:02:31.920 --> 1:02:35.720\n and it more becomes like a blockchain style consensus.\n\n1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:38.360\n So you let go of like, you know what?\n\n1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:42.760\n There's this human dream, you get this on the internet,\n\n1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:47.080\n you get like facts, as if there's at the bottom,\n\n1:02:47.080 --> 1:02:49.400\n at the bottom, there's one turtle that's holding\n\n1:02:49.400 --> 1:02:54.040\n this scroll that says, these are the truths of the world.\n\n1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:57.360\n The problem is, I mean, maybe believing\n\n1:02:57.360 --> 1:02:59.040\n that is counterproductive.\n\n1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:04.040\n Maybe human civilization is an ongoing process of consensus.\n\n1:03:04.640 --> 1:03:08.320\n And so it's always going to be, everything is shrouded\n\n1:03:08.320 --> 1:03:11.000\n and you can call them lies or you can call them inaccuracies\n\n1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.720\n or you can call them delusions.\n\n1:03:13.720 --> 1:03:16.680\n It's constantly going to be, it's going to be a sea of lies\n\n1:03:16.680 --> 1:03:21.680\n and delusions, but our hope is to over time\n\n1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:24.520\n develop bigger and bigger islands of consensus\n\n1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:27.520\n that allows us to live a stable and happy society.\n\n1:03:27.520 --> 1:03:32.520\n Don't call it true, call it a stable consensus\n\n1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:34.880\n that creates a high quality of life\n\n1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:36.800\n for the inhabitants of the island.\n\n1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:38.400\n I like it, I mean, I like it.\n\n1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:40.240\n I mean, we're going to agree on this.\n\n1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:43.080\n And then don't use outlook, no, I'm just kidding.\n\n1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:47.840\n So maybe a step back, you mentioned, I'd love to talk\n\n1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:49.400\n about ShadowCrew, maybe this is the right time\n\n1:03:49.400 --> 1:03:51.440\n to actually, yeah, let's go to ShadowCrew\n\n1:03:51.440 --> 1:03:53.040\n because it's such a fascinating story.\n\n1:03:53.040 --> 1:03:54.680\n So tell me the story of building ShadowCrew,\n\n1:03:54.680 --> 1:03:59.800\n the precursor to today's darknet and darknet markets.\n\n1:03:59.800 --> 1:04:02.960\n This is why you're the original Godfather.\n\n1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:04.600\n This is it, this is it.\n\n1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:06.640\n So I get married.\n\n1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:09.120\n I faked a car accident to get married,\n\n1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:10.160\n got the money from that.\n\n1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:11.120\n You're romantic.\n\n1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:13.320\n I remember, like my dad, man.\n\n1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:15.000\n I'm the guy that, you know, I get from mom,\n\n1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:16.720\n I get the criminal mindset.\n\n1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:19.600\n From dad, I get that, don't want him to leave.\n\n1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:22.480\n So, you know, so.\n\n1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:26.520\n To get married, what's that story?\n\n1:04:26.520 --> 1:04:28.160\n Oh, dude, I was.\n\n1:04:28.160 --> 1:04:29.680\n How did you fall in love there?\n\n1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:32.120\n My first girlfriend was a preacher's daughter\n\n1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:35.280\n and crazy over her, dated her for five years.\n\n1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:38.680\n And she figured out pretty quickly that,\n\n1:04:38.680 --> 1:04:40.360\n well, not quickly, it took her five years\n\n1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:44.760\n to figure out that Brett Johnson is not the man of God.\n\n1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:50.600\n I could talk it, but more that agnostic than anything,\n\n1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:52.320\n she breaks up with me.\n\n1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:54.880\n So I was at the community college.\n\n1:04:54.880 --> 1:04:56.840\n You'd make one hell of a preacher by the way.\n\n1:04:56.840 --> 1:04:57.360\n Thank you.\n\n1:04:57.360 --> 1:04:59.680\n Let's put that.\n\n1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:02.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:02.360 --> 1:05:04.080\n I've got that Langston Hughes problem.\n\n1:05:04.080 --> 1:05:08.920\n I'm looking for Jesus to show up and he just doesn't.\n\n1:05:08.920 --> 1:05:10.520\n So I was at the community college\n\n1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:12.040\n and I was a straight asshole.\n\n1:05:12.040 --> 1:05:14.480\n I was arrogant, conceited, everything else.\n\n1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:17.520\n And I had posted an advertisement\n\n1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:20.440\n on one of the billboards looking for an adult babysitter,\n\n1:05:20.440 --> 1:05:24.040\n hot blonde, you know, come visit me in the library.\n\n1:05:24.040 --> 1:05:26.240\n Buddy of mine shows up and he's like, Brett.\n\n1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:27.520\n And I was like, yeah.\n\n1:05:27.520 --> 1:05:29.920\n He's like, hottest girl in school, right down the hall.\n\n1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:30.960\n And I was like, serious?\n\n1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:31.680\n He's like, yeah.\n\n1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:34.240\n And I was like, let's go see.\n\n1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:37.360\n Walk over and there's these two guys that are hitting on her.\n\n1:05:37.360 --> 1:05:40.840\n So I just walk up and me and Todd, that was my buddy,\n\n1:05:40.840 --> 1:05:43.360\n walk up and I'm just sitting there and listening.\n\n1:05:43.360 --> 1:05:45.280\n And they're giving the spill and everything.\n\n1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:46.680\n And she's just kind of taking it in.\n\n1:05:46.680 --> 1:05:48.880\n Finally, I looked over and I was like,\n\n1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:50.560\n you want to get out of here?\n\n1:05:50.560 --> 1:05:53.560\n And one of the guys looks at me and he's like, hey,\n\n1:05:53.560 --> 1:05:54.080\n we're talking to you.\n\n1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:55.840\n And I was like, well, you're talking at her.\n\n1:05:55.840 --> 1:05:57.080\n You're not talking to her.\n\n1:05:57.080 --> 1:05:59.320\n I'm about to save her ass from you.\n\n1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:01.320\n Yeah, that's a smooth pick up line, by the way.\n\n1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:02.720\n If I ever heard one, that's good.\n\n1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:04.160\n You want to get out of here?\n\n1:06:04.160 --> 1:06:08.520\n So start dating, and she was the girl\n\n1:06:08.520 --> 1:06:10.960\n that screwed my brains out.\n\n1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:13.120\n And I fell head over heels.\n\n1:06:13.120 --> 1:06:15.120\n We got married six months later.\n\n1:06:15.120 --> 1:06:16.000\n Six months.\n\n1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:17.040\n That's what love does.\n\n1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:18.240\n That's what it does.\n\n1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:22.800\n And she didn't know I was a crook.\n\n1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:24.480\n She had no idea.\n\n1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:26.240\n She knew I was very bright.\n\n1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:30.480\n She knew I did a lot of theater, stuff like that.\n\n1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:32.760\n Got a job at, I was in hazard.\n\n1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:35.760\n There was no jobs to be had, so I got a job in Lexington,\n\n1:06:35.760 --> 1:06:38.480\n because we were going to be moving to the UK.\n\n1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:43.240\n Got a job in Lexington at Lexmark testing printer boards,\n\n1:06:43.240 --> 1:06:44.480\n circuit boards.\n\n1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:46.920\n So I would leave on a Thursday night,\n\n1:06:46.920 --> 1:06:50.480\n work three 18 hour shifts at Lexmark,\n\n1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:54.120\n come back home on Monday.\n\n1:06:54.120 --> 1:06:56.000\n Got married, faked a car accident\n\n1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:02.160\n to get the rest of the money that I needed to get married.\n\n1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:07.240\n And the faking on that, man, I had bought a Chevy Spectrum\n\n1:07:07.240 --> 1:07:08.080\n at a car auction.\n\n1:07:08.080 --> 1:07:09.840\n Gave like $500 for it.\n\n1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:14.040\n My aunt had previously defrauded USAA insurance\n\n1:07:14.040 --> 1:07:16.360\n on a car accident, and she was telling me all about it.\n\n1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:18.440\n She's like, look, go down to this chiropractor.\n\n1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:19.940\n Make sure you get the insurance where\n\n1:07:19.940 --> 1:07:21.320\n they'll pay for a rental car.\n\n1:07:21.320 --> 1:07:22.480\n They'll pay lost wages.\n\n1:07:22.480 --> 1:07:24.160\n I was like, they pay lost wages?\n\n1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:25.760\n She's like, yeah, they pay lost wages.\n\n1:07:25.760 --> 1:07:26.960\n I was like, hmm.\n\n1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:29.120\n She's like, by the way, you work for me.\n\n1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:32.000\n And I was like, I work for you.\n\n1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:34.400\n And you get to define the wage.\n\n1:07:34.400 --> 1:07:37.120\n And you could also define how long you were unable to work.\n\n1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:37.760\n Exactly.\n\n1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:38.360\n Exactly.\n\n1:07:38.360 --> 1:07:40.760\n And the chiropractor will sign off on any damn thing.\n\n1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:45.720\n So my cousin, Ronnie, he figures out that I'm going.\n\n1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:47.840\n He finds out I'm going to fake this car accident.\n\n1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:48.360\n So he comes to me.\n\n1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:49.680\n He's like, hey, man, can I get in on that?\n\n1:07:49.680 --> 1:07:51.440\n I was like, yeah, man, you get on that.\n\n1:07:51.440 --> 1:07:53.960\n So this kid, he's five days younger than I am.\n\n1:07:53.960 --> 1:07:55.760\n This kid, he goes to the dentist the day\n\n1:07:55.760 --> 1:07:58.200\n that we're faking it, has a tooth pulled,\n\n1:07:58.200 --> 1:08:01.040\n tells the dentist not to numb it, not to stitch it,\n\n1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:02.320\n just pull it.\n\n1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:04.560\n So he shows up.\n\n1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:06.360\n He shows up the day that we're driving out\n\n1:08:06.360 --> 1:08:07.120\n to fake the accident.\n\n1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:08.360\n He's got blood all over his shirt.\n\n1:08:08.360 --> 1:08:09.960\n He's still bleeding out of the mouth and everything else.\n\n1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:10.760\n I'm like, are you OK?\n\n1:08:10.760 --> 1:08:12.160\n He's like, yeah, man, it's going to be good.\n\n1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:12.960\n It's going to be good.\n\n1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:14.680\n I'm like, OK.\n\n1:08:14.680 --> 1:08:17.240\n My mom, by this point, I'm living with my grandparents.\n\n1:08:17.240 --> 1:08:20.280\n My mom is up in the head of a hollow.\n\n1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:22.040\n So we're like, we'll just do it up there.\n\n1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:25.080\n We'll go act like we're visiting my mom on the way back out,\n\n1:08:25.080 --> 1:08:26.480\n ran over a mountain.\n\n1:08:26.480 --> 1:08:27.240\n OK.\n\n1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:30.640\n So we go visit and everything, come back out that night,\n\n1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:32.360\n run over the side of the hill.\n\n1:08:32.360 --> 1:08:33.840\n Me and Ronnie walk back up.\n\n1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:35.840\n Of course, it totals the car.\n\n1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:37.960\n Walk back to my mom's, acting like we've wrecked.\n\n1:08:37.960 --> 1:08:40.000\n She knows what time it is and everything else.\n\n1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:41.800\n And file the claims.\n\n1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:44.400\n So that gets the money to get married.\n\n1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:49.080\n And me and my wife moved from Hazard to Lexington.\n\n1:08:49.080 --> 1:08:57.640\n And I'm the kid that my crime, usually, if I was a single guy,\n\n1:08:57.640 --> 1:08:58.960\n wouldn't break the law.\n\n1:08:58.960 --> 1:08:59.440\n Wouldn't.\n\n1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:00.520\n I would be all right.\n\n1:09:00.520 --> 1:09:03.280\n But females involved, oh, yeah.\n\n1:09:03.280 --> 1:09:03.760\n Oh, yeah.\n\n1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:04.640\n Got to spend the money.\n\n1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:05.640\n Got to show them gifts.\n\n1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:07.840\n Everything else was never enough to show love\n\n1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:09.280\n in some sort of healthy way.\n\n1:09:09.280 --> 1:09:10.480\n Always had to go overboard.\n\n1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:12.240\n And typically, it was buying or stealing\n\n1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:13.440\n some sort of expensive crap.\n\n1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:15.200\n So that was the thing.\n\n1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:19.120\n That was the way you show love is by buying expensive gifts.\n\n1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:20.680\n Or something overboard.\n\n1:09:20.680 --> 1:09:24.360\n Back then, with Susan, initially, it was,\n\n1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:25.520\n don't worry about working.\n\n1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:26.480\n I got it.\n\n1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:27.980\n You just worry about going to school.\n\n1:09:27.980 --> 1:09:29.480\n She was a music major.\n\n1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:31.560\n I was like, you just worry about going to school.\n\n1:09:31.560 --> 1:09:34.040\n So don't worry about cooking and cleaning.\n\n1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:34.560\n I got it.\n\n1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:35.360\n I got it.\n\n1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:37.800\n So not only was I this guy that was going overboard,\n\n1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:40.200\n but I was kind of a control freak, too.\n\n1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:41.000\n So no, I got it.\n\n1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:41.480\n I got it.\n\n1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:42.240\n I got it.\n\n1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:47.760\n So here I am, 60 hour a week job, 18 hour class load,\n\n1:09:47.760 --> 1:09:48.760\n cooking and cleaning.\n\n1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:50.320\n Something had to give.\n\n1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:51.200\n I quit the job.\n\n1:09:51.200 --> 1:09:51.880\n I couldn't do it.\n\n1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:55.080\n Quit the job and start back in fraud.\n\n1:09:55.080 --> 1:09:57.960\n And trying to hide that from her at the same time.\n\n1:09:57.960 --> 1:09:59.720\n So it was initially telemarketing fraud.\n\n1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:07.240\n The first job I had was a telemarketer at a cemetery,\n\n1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:08.760\n selling gravesites.\n\n1:10:08.760 --> 1:10:11.320\n And then that ended.\n\n1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:13.640\n Went over to work for the Shriners Circus, Shriners\n\n1:10:13.640 --> 1:10:14.280\n Hospital.\n\n1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:16.440\n And it was a third party company that\n\n1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:17.780\n was doing all the telemarketing.\n\n1:10:17.780 --> 1:10:19.680\n Made really good money doing that.\n\n1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:21.420\n That job ended.\n\n1:10:21.420 --> 1:10:25.120\n And then they pivoted over to working with Kiwanis Clubs,\n\n1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:29.280\n selling food baskets to the food banks and everything.\n\n1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:34.880\n So I stole the phone list and started at my own Kiwanis Club\n\n1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:38.000\n and would do the telemarketing, go out twice a week\n\n1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.440\n and pick up checks.\n\n1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:44.920\n Well, what happened was is I'm going out picking up checks,\n\n1:10:44.920 --> 1:10:46.200\n go knock on a door.\n\n1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:48.440\n Turns out one of the persons that I had called\n\n1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:50.800\n was a law enforcement officer.\n\n1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:54.000\n So he was like, who are you?\n\n1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:55.360\n I'm with the Kiwanis Club.\n\n1:10:55.360 --> 1:10:57.320\n And he's like, no, you're not.\n\n1:10:57.320 --> 1:11:00.880\n So got arrested, spent three months in a county jail\n\n1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:03.080\n for theft by deception.\n\n1:11:03.080 --> 1:11:04.240\n Got out.\n\n1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:09.120\n And we had to move from Lexington back to Hazard\n\n1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:10.920\n and live with Susan's parents.\n\n1:11:10.920 --> 1:11:15.080\n They had gotten a desktop computer, HP.\n\n1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:18.640\n And I started surfing around online.\n\n1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:19.880\n Found eBay.\n\n1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:22.800\n And didn't really know how to make money on eBay.\n\n1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:28.200\n At about the same time, I'm committing low level frauds\n\n1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:29.000\n online.\n\n1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:30.960\n And I don't really talk about that in the past.\n\n1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:32.920\n The first time I've really talked about that.\n\n1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:37.560\n But I would pay for it with bad checks.\n\n1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:41.160\n So more person, so not using a platform like eBay and more.\n\n1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:44.080\n I would find somebody that had like a stereo system on eBay,\n\n1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:44.920\n something like that.\n\n1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:46.800\n And I'd pay for it with a bad check\n\n1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:49.880\n and would rely on them not to chase me\n\n1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:51.680\n because they were out of state at that point.\n\n1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:53.960\n And the dollar amounts were very low.\n\n1:11:53.960 --> 1:11:56.480\n So got the money to move to finally\n\n1:11:56.480 --> 1:11:58.800\n did those schemes enough to get the money\n\n1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:01.760\n to move back to Lexington.\n\n1:12:01.760 --> 1:12:02.760\n Got to Lexington.\n\n1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:04.880\n And by this point, I'm doing, like I said,\n\n1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:07.200\n these schemes on eBay.\n\n1:12:07.200 --> 1:12:09.160\n And I'm like, there's got to be a better way\n\n1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:10.200\n to make money on eBay.\n\n1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:11.000\n Got to be.\n\n1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.560\n So didn't really know how.\n\n1:12:13.560 --> 1:12:16.520\n One night, I'm watching Inside Edition with Bill Riley.\n\n1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:18.400\n And they're profiling Beanie Babies.\n\n1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:19.760\n So I'm sitting there watching.\n\n1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:21.960\n The one they're profiling is this one called Peanut,\n\n1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:23.520\n the Royal Blue Elephant.\n\n1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:25.680\n Selling for $1,500 on eBay.\n\n1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:27.200\n I'm sitting there going like, shit,\n\n1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:30.440\n I need to find me a peanut.\n\n1:12:30.440 --> 1:12:32.000\n My initial thought was, well, there's\n\n1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.880\n got to be one in one of these Hallmark stores\n\n1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:35.440\n in Kentucky someplace.\n\n1:12:35.440 --> 1:12:36.880\n So I skip class the next day.\n\n1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:39.640\n Went out around all the Hallmark stores looking for peanut.\n\n1:12:39.640 --> 1:12:40.880\n No, idiot.\n\n1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:43.720\n He's on eBay for $1,500.\n\n1:12:43.720 --> 1:12:49.280\n So after a few hours of that, I'm like, hmm.\n\n1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:51.440\n Turns out they had a little gray Beanie Baby elephants\n\n1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:52.760\n for $8.\n\n1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:54.440\n Picked up one of those for $8.\n\n1:12:54.440 --> 1:12:56.040\n Stopped by Kroger on the way home.\n\n1:12:56.040 --> 1:12:58.320\n Picked up a pack of Blue Rit dye.\n\n1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:00.440\n Went home, tried to dye the little guy.\n\n1:13:00.440 --> 1:13:02.560\n So that was a nightmare.\n\n1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:04.680\n Turns out they're made out of polyester.\n\n1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:05.760\n Get them out of the bath.\n\n1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:08.480\n Looks like they've got the mange.\n\n1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:11.680\n And what happens is, so I'm trying to dye the damn thing.\n\n1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:13.280\n I'm like, well, that's not going to work.\n\n1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:14.680\n That's just not going to work.\n\n1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:17.320\n So I got online, found a picture of a real one,\n\n1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:20.800\n posted it on eBay, and I was like, well, what I can do\n\n1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:25.520\n is I can claim that's the one I've got\n\n1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:28.400\n and then maybe claim that it got messed up in the mail\n\n1:13:28.400 --> 1:13:29.400\n and work out like that.\n\n1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:32.080\n So posted a picture of a real one online.\n\n1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:33.640\n Woman thought I had the real thing.\n\n1:13:33.640 --> 1:13:35.600\n She wins the bid.\n\n1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:37.480\n That social engineering kicks in immediately.\n\n1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:39.480\n I didn't want to be on the defensive.\n\n1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:41.360\n I wanted to put her on the defensive.\n\n1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:44.000\n So as soon as she wins the bid, I send her a message.\n\n1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:46.160\n Hey, we've not done any business before.\n\n1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:47.760\n I don't even know if I can trust you.\n\n1:13:47.760 --> 1:13:50.640\n What I need you to do, protects us both.\n\n1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:52.240\n Go down the US Postal Service.\n\n1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:54.960\n Get two money orders totaling $1,500.\n\n1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:57.520\n Send them to me issued by the US government.\n\n1:13:57.520 --> 1:14:00.040\n That way we're both protected.\n\n1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:02.560\n Soon as I get the money orders, I'll send you your animal.\n\n1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:03.320\n She believed that.\n\n1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:04.680\n Didn't ask any questions at all.\n\n1:14:04.680 --> 1:14:07.000\n She believed that.\n\n1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:07.960\n Sent me the money orders.\n\n1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:09.640\n I cashed them out.\n\n1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:10.960\n Sent her the creature.\n\n1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:12.640\n Immediately got a phone call.\n\n1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:13.840\n I didn't order this.\n\n1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:16.840\n My response, lady, you ordered a blue elephant.\n\n1:14:16.840 --> 1:14:19.840\n I sent you a blue fish elephant.\n\n1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:21.880\n And she got pissed.\n\n1:14:21.880 --> 1:14:23.920\n And she kept calling.\n\n1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:25.440\n What I found out, and that's really\n\n1:14:25.440 --> 1:14:27.800\n the first lesson of cybercrime that most of these criminals,\n\n1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:29.160\n including self, learns.\n\n1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:30.680\n If you delay a victim long enough,\n\n1:14:30.680 --> 1:14:31.960\n just keep putting them off.\n\n1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:33.720\n A lot of them, they get exasperated,\n\n1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:35.520\n throw their hands in the air, walk away.\n\n1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:36.720\n You don't hear from them.\n\n1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:40.200\n And none of them, to this day, none of them\n\n1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:41.480\n complain to law enforcement.\n\n1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:42.800\n They eat it.\n\n1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:47.400\n So it's a mixture of you're exhausted by the process,\n\n1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:49.520\n so it's just easier to walk away,\n\n1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:52.160\n and second, almost like an embarrassment.\n\n1:14:52.160 --> 1:14:54.880\n So there's a whole slew of reasons, all right?\n\n1:14:54.880 --> 1:14:56.760\n There's the exhaustion, certainly.\n\n1:14:56.760 --> 1:14:57.880\n There's the embarrassment.\n\n1:14:57.880 --> 1:14:59.680\n So if you figure out, if you look at it today,\n\n1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:00.960\n where does the embarrassment come from?\n\n1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:03.560\n Well, the media, family members,\n\n1:15:03.560 --> 1:15:06.520\n we're all very good about blaming the victim for crimes.\n\n1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:07.600\n Why would you click on the link?\n\n1:15:07.600 --> 1:15:09.280\n Why would you send money to somebody you don't know?\n\n1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:10.240\n Blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:12.240\n So you've got that that's going on.\n\n1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:15.720\n You've got the issue of, who do you complain to?\n\n1:15:15.720 --> 1:15:16.960\n Back then, you didn't know.\n\n1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:18.160\n Do you complain to local police?\n\n1:15:18.160 --> 1:15:21.240\n Because she's in another state, so which local police\n\n1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:22.440\n do you complain to?\n\n1:15:22.440 --> 1:15:23.600\n Do you complain to the feds?\n\n1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:25.400\n Well, the dollar amounts aren't high enough\n\n1:15:25.400 --> 1:15:26.440\n to complain to feds.\n\n1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:28.200\n Feds are going to tell you to go local.\n\n1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:30.720\n Local's going to tell you, hey, it happened in Kentucky.\n\n1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:31.600\n Complain to them.\n\n1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:34.080\n Kentucky's going to tell you, well, shit, you're over there.\n\n1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:35.000\n We need you to come in.\n\n1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.320\n So there's this whole issue of the jurisdiction,\n\n1:15:38.320 --> 1:15:41.480\n of the blame factor, everything else.\n\n1:15:41.480 --> 1:15:45.240\n So I got away with that crime and did it under my own name\n\n1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:46.920\n at that point.\n\n1:15:46.920 --> 1:15:49.360\n I kept going and got better at it,\n\n1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:51.760\n started to understand how to hide identities,\n\n1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:52.480\n things like that.\n\n1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:54.720\n Started selling pirated software.\n\n1:15:54.720 --> 1:15:58.080\n Pirated software led into installing mod chips.\n\n1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:02.040\n The initial pirated software was Sega Saturn, PlayStation 1.\n\n1:16:02.040 --> 1:16:03.760\n Well, you had to have a mod chip in those\n\n1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:06.480\n to play the pirated disk, so I started\n\n1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:08.760\n selling and installing mod chips.\n\n1:16:08.760 --> 1:16:11.680\n That led into installing mod chips in the cable television\n\n1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:15.200\n boxes so you could watch all the pay per view, which in turn\n\n1:16:15.200 --> 1:16:18.160\n led into programming satellite DSS cards.\n\n1:16:18.160 --> 1:16:20.880\n Those 18 inch RCA satellite systems,\n\n1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:24.600\n pull the card out of it, program it, turns on all the channels.\n\n1:16:24.600 --> 1:16:26.080\n Started doing that.\n\n1:16:26.080 --> 1:16:28.400\n Can we just pause?\n\n1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:33.800\n That is very entrepreneurial.\n\n1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:41.160\n So just technically, so there's laws and rules\n\n1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:43.320\n that you're breaking nonstop.\n\n1:16:43.320 --> 1:16:46.920\n So there's also legitimate ways of doing\n\n1:16:46.920 --> 1:16:49.880\n that, which is break the rules of the conventions of the past.\n\n1:16:49.880 --> 1:16:51.360\n That's the first principles thing.\n\n1:16:51.360 --> 1:16:55.400\n That's what Elon Musk and his ilk do all the time.\n\n1:16:55.400 --> 1:16:59.520\n That is guts and brilliance.\n\n1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:03.080\n But when it's crossing the lines of the law,\n\n1:17:03.080 --> 1:17:07.240\n actually sometimes the law is outdated.\n\n1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:09.080\n The thing is, as a human being, you\n\n1:17:09.080 --> 1:17:12.720\n have to then compute the ethical damage you're doing.\n\n1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:14.000\n Like ethically, the damage you're\n\n1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.720\n doing about other human beings, that is fundamentally\n\n1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:19.040\n the thing that you're breaking, is you're\n\n1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:22.720\n adding to the suffering in the world in one way or another,\n\n1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:24.160\n and you're justifying it.\n\n1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:27.800\n But in terms of me sort of as an engineer,\n\n1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:29.440\n that is some gutsy thinking.\n\n1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:34.360\n That's how Woz and Steve Jobs thought.\n\n1:17:34.360 --> 1:17:35.680\n That's innovation.\n\n1:17:35.680 --> 1:17:40.880\n And maybe just think, if you can introspect your thinking\n\n1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:44.720\n process here, this is a new, I like\n\n1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:48.800\n how you remember this in HP, this\n\n1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:50.160\n is a totally new thing to you.\n\n1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:53.640\n Computers is another domain.\n\n1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:56.040\n How were you figuring these puzzles out,\n\n1:17:56.040 --> 1:17:58.320\n presumably mostly alone?\n\n1:17:58.320 --> 1:17:58.960\n Alone.\n\n1:17:58.960 --> 1:18:03.160\n When you were thinking through these problems, is there,\n\n1:18:03.160 --> 1:18:04.720\n this is a strange question to ask,\n\n1:18:04.720 --> 1:18:08.640\n but what is your thinking process?\n\n1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:10.800\n What is your approach to solving these problems?\n\n1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:15.680\n So the approach is you do something, and you fuck it up,\n\n1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:20.160\n and you're like, you think back, OK, how do I fix that?\n\n1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:23.880\n You fix that aspect, you commit the crime again.\n\n1:18:23.880 --> 1:18:26.720\n And it goes a little bit further, and it screws up.\n\n1:18:26.720 --> 1:18:28.640\n OK, how do I fix that?\n\n1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:29.640\n What's the issue on that?\n\n1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:30.440\n How do I fix that?\n\n1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:32.880\n So there's not a deep design thinking like that?\n\n1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:33.960\n Later on, it becomes that.\n\n1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:36.800\n Once you lay that groundwork of the way\n\n1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:39.160\n these schemes are working, it becomes that.\n\n1:18:39.160 --> 1:18:42.920\n And you can apply that to other things in cybercrime\n\n1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:44.480\n as a whole.\n\n1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:47.640\n But initially, it's basically trial and error.\n\n1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:50.880\n You've got a problem, how do you solve that problem?\n\n1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:54.400\n So I'm committing these crimes under my name,\n\n1:18:54.400 --> 1:18:56.360\n how do I solve that?\n\n1:18:56.360 --> 1:18:57.920\n Well, one of the first principles\n\n1:18:57.920 --> 1:18:59.680\n that we started to teach on Shadow Crew\n\n1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:03.920\n is all crime should begin with identity theft.\n\n1:19:03.920 --> 1:19:05.680\n That's one of the main first principles\n\n1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:08.160\n that a lot of people to this day still don't really get.\n\n1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:10.240\n All right, why would I commit a crime under my name\n\n1:19:10.240 --> 1:19:12.080\n if I can do it under your name?\n\n1:19:12.080 --> 1:19:13.840\n So that's one of the big buffers.\n\n1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:15.440\n And that takes trial and error to get\n\n1:19:15.440 --> 1:19:17.480\n to that point where you start to understand\n\n1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:20.960\n that's the way crime should operate if you're a criminal.\n\n1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:25.000\n But with me, it's trial and error.\n\n1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:28.160\n It's that childhood where that mindset\n\n1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:31.360\n is kind of ingrained in you where you're looking\n\n1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:35.160\n for ways, let's say nontraditional ways\n\n1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:37.840\n of getting around things or getting through things.\n\n1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:41.160\n I mean, one of the questions I'll probably ask this later\n\n1:19:41.160 --> 1:19:44.480\n is there's also a unique aspect to the outcome\n\n1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:47.440\n of what you were doing, which is you weren't,\n\n1:19:47.440 --> 1:19:50.480\n you didn't get caught for a very long time.\n\n1:19:50.480 --> 1:19:52.000\n We'll talk about why that is.\n\n1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:54.000\n And the thing is, it's so interesting,\n\n1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:59.000\n all crime probably should, to be effective,\n\n1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:01.360\n should start with identity theft.\n\n1:20:01.360 --> 1:20:02.760\n I like that identity theft\n\n1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:05.240\n because identity theft can take so many forms.\n\n1:20:05.240 --> 1:20:06.880\n Right, right.\n\n1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:09.160\n So yes, so Shadow Crew.\n\n1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:13.240\n So what's, so as we're, you started with love.\n\n1:20:13.240 --> 1:20:14.080\n Started with love.\n\n1:20:14.080 --> 1:20:17.160\n So now we're doing these schemes online.\n\n1:20:18.360 --> 1:20:20.240\n I'm selling to these,\n\n1:20:20.240 --> 1:20:22.000\n I'm programming these satellite DSS cards.\n\n1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:24.160\n And one of the interesting things,\n\n1:20:24.160 --> 1:20:26.000\n and you still see that to this day,\n\n1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:29.080\n is something will happen\n\n1:20:29.080 --> 1:20:33.440\n that will create an industry for criminals, all right?\n\n1:20:33.440 --> 1:20:37.400\n So what happened is Canada, Canadian judge,\n\n1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:38.440\n rules about the same time\n\n1:20:38.440 --> 1:20:40.560\n that I'm doing these satellite cards,\n\n1:20:40.560 --> 1:20:41.920\n Canadian judge comes out and says,\n\n1:20:41.920 --> 1:20:46.920\n hey, it's legal for my citizens to pirate those signals.\n\n1:20:47.560 --> 1:20:49.960\n And his reasoning was is since RCA\n\n1:20:49.960 --> 1:20:51.480\n doesn't sell the systems up here,\n\n1:20:51.480 --> 1:20:53.920\n my citizens can pirate it.\n\n1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:57.440\n Okay, so what happens is is overnight,\n\n1:20:57.440 --> 1:20:59.680\n about the same time PayPal comes into play.\n\n1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:03.280\n So PayPal is coming right online at about the same time.\n\n1:21:03.280 --> 1:21:05.400\n Overnight, a little cottage industry\n\n1:21:05.400 --> 1:21:07.240\n pops up in the United States.\n\n1:21:07.240 --> 1:21:09.400\n You go down to Best Buy, buy the system for $100,\n\n1:21:09.400 --> 1:21:11.360\n take it out in the parking lot, open system up,\n\n1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:13.000\n pull it, open box up, pull the system out,\n\n1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:14.640\n pull the card out, throw the system away,\n\n1:21:14.640 --> 1:21:17.840\n program the card, ship its ass to Canada, $500 a pop.\n\n1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:19.920\n Started doing that.\n\n1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:21.520\n Business is good.\n\n1:21:21.520 --> 1:21:23.760\n Making, you know, $3,000, $4,000 a week doing that.\n\n1:21:23.760 --> 1:21:25.160\n I'm like, yeah, that's good.\n\n1:21:26.040 --> 1:21:29.000\n I have so many orders, I can't fill all the orders\n\n1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:30.560\n and quickly think to myself,\n\n1:21:31.920 --> 1:21:33.720\n why do I need to fill any of them?\n\n1:21:33.720 --> 1:21:34.960\n They're in Canada.\n\n1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:35.960\n I'm down here.\n\n1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:39.160\n You know, who are they gonna complain to?\n\n1:21:39.160 --> 1:21:42.960\n Because I already found out people don't complain, all right?\n\n1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:45.160\n They're not gonna complain to anybody.\n\n1:21:45.160 --> 1:21:46.120\n So I start not.\n\n1:21:46.120 --> 1:21:46.960\n Especially in Canada.\n\n1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:47.960\n Especially in Canada.\n\n1:21:47.960 --> 1:21:50.560\n And I'm having them send money.\n\n1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:53.000\n That's when PayPal's first into play.\n\n1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:58.000\n And it amazes me that everybody is using PayPal.\n\n1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.360\n It's like, you don't even have to really ask.\n\n1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:01.400\n They're like, can we pay by,\n\n1:22:01.400 --> 1:22:03.240\n yeah, you can pay all day long by PayPal.\n\n1:22:03.240 --> 1:22:05.840\n And PayPal had no clue what they were doing with security.\n\n1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:08.280\n So it's like, okay.\n\n1:22:08.280 --> 1:22:09.800\n So they're sending money to PayPal.\n\n1:22:09.800 --> 1:22:13.280\n I'm having the PayPal cashed out to bank accounts\n\n1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:14.640\n in my name at that point.\n\n1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:17.400\n And I get scared because by that point,\n\n1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:20.080\n I'm still in four to $6,000 a week.\n\n1:22:20.080 --> 1:22:23.440\n And I'm like, somebody's gonna be looking at money laundering.\n\n1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:24.920\n So get it in my head.\n\n1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:27.160\n I'm like, best thing that I can do\n\n1:22:27.160 --> 1:22:28.880\n is get a fake driver's license,\n\n1:22:28.880 --> 1:22:31.120\n open up a bank account using that driver's license,\n\n1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:33.240\n cash out at the ATM.\n\n1:22:33.240 --> 1:22:34.080\n Good.\n\n1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:35.400\n No idea where to get a fake ID.\n\n1:22:35.400 --> 1:22:36.480\n Not a clue.\n\n1:22:36.480 --> 1:22:38.640\n So I get online, looked around.\n\n1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:40.280\n Spent a couple of weeks looking around.\n\n1:22:40.280 --> 1:22:41.480\n Thought I found a guy.\n\n1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:43.840\n He went by the screen name of Fake ID Man.\n\n1:22:43.840 --> 1:22:46.920\n Thought I found a guy, sent him $200, sent him my picture.\n\n1:22:46.920 --> 1:22:48.120\n Dude rips me off.\n\n1:22:48.120 --> 1:22:52.720\n And I'm like, what the hell, man?\n\n1:22:52.720 --> 1:22:53.560\n Oh, I got played.\n\n1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:57.200\n He had a little website set up with reviews.\n\n1:22:57.200 --> 1:22:58.720\n And I'm like, oh, it's all legitimate.\n\n1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:01.080\n He's building that trust that I talked about.\n\n1:23:01.080 --> 1:23:05.400\n So the end result, I got pissed.\n\n1:23:05.400 --> 1:23:10.400\n And there was no site that dealt with anything\n\n1:23:10.400 --> 1:23:14.000\n criminal or cyber crime related.\n\n1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:17.040\n The only real avenue you had was an IRC chat session,\n\n1:23:17.040 --> 1:23:18.520\n internet relay chat.\n\n1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:20.760\n And that, I'm sure you've been on that.\n\n1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:22.800\n It's this rolling chat board.\n\n1:23:22.800 --> 1:23:24.680\n You don't know who the hell you're talking to.\n\n1:23:24.680 --> 1:23:26.000\n Most of them are full of shit.\n\n1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:27.280\n You can't trust anybody.\n\n1:23:27.280 --> 1:23:29.440\n And you're sitting there trying to conduct business.\n\n1:23:29.440 --> 1:23:32.200\n So if somebody claims they've got a product or service,\n\n1:23:32.200 --> 1:23:33.040\n do they have it?\n\n1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:33.880\n Does it work?\n\n1:23:33.880 --> 1:23:34.700\n Are they just gonna rip you off?\n\n1:23:34.700 --> 1:23:37.000\n Because in those channels, everyone's a criminal.\n\n1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:42.000\n I kept looking around and I've happened upon a website\n\n1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:44.600\n called Counterfeit Library.\n\n1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:48.160\n And Counterfeit Library only dealt with counterfeit degrees\n\n1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:51.720\n and certificates, degree mail type stuff.\n\n1:23:51.720 --> 1:23:55.320\n But they had a forum and no one was using the forum.\n\n1:23:55.320 --> 1:23:58.360\n So I basically get on there and bitch every day.\n\n1:23:58.360 --> 1:24:00.360\n I got ripped off, don't know what to do,\n\n1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:01.600\n bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.\n\n1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:03.320\n About the same time I started doing that,\n\n1:24:03.320 --> 1:24:04.840\n two other guys show up.\n\n1:24:04.840 --> 1:24:07.360\n One's named Mr. X, he's out of Los Angeles.\n\n1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:08.720\n Other guy's named Beelzebub,\n\n1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:11.760\n he's out of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.\n\n1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:13.560\n And we all become buddies.\n\n1:24:13.560 --> 1:24:15.240\n So a few weeks of me bitching,\n\n1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:16.800\n a few weeks of them responding.\n\n1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:20.800\n Beelzebub gets me on ICQ and he sends me a message.\n\n1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:22.560\n He's like, I went by the screen name of Gollum\n\n1:24:22.560 --> 1:24:24.080\n at that point, Gollum Fun.\n\n1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:26.120\n And he's like, Gollum, I can make you\n\n1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:27.200\n a fake driver's license.\n\n1:24:27.200 --> 1:24:28.640\n And I was like, well, motherfucker, do it.\n\n1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:30.660\n And he's like, well, I'm gonna charge you for it.\n\n1:24:30.660 --> 1:24:32.360\n I'm like, yeah, you are.\n\n1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:33.880\n He's like, I am.\n\n1:24:33.880 --> 1:24:35.440\n I was like, no, you're not.\n\n1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:37.980\n And he's like, look, man, he said,\n\n1:24:37.980 --> 1:24:40.240\n this business, if you're gonna do this,\n\n1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:44.120\n you have to trust people or you're gonna fail.\n\n1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:46.720\n He said, so I'm gonna charge you $200,\n\n1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:49.000\n but I'm gonna send you a driver's license.\n\n1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.080\n Well, by this point, I'm friends with the people\n\n1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:53.080\n who own Counterfeit Library.\n\n1:24:53.080 --> 1:24:55.640\n We're emailing, chatting, everything else.\n\n1:24:55.640 --> 1:24:59.580\n And I tell him, I'm like, okay, I'm gonna send you $200.\n\n1:24:59.580 --> 1:25:02.360\n That way, when you rip me off, I'll have them ban you\n\n1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:04.000\n and I don't have to deal with you anymore.\n\n1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:04.880\n And he's like, bet.\n\n1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:06.360\n I'm like, okay.\n\n1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:08.880\n So I sent him $200, sent him my picture.\n\n1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:11.680\n Two weeks later, I get a driver's license.\n\n1:25:11.680 --> 1:25:13.720\n Name is Steven Schwecki out of Ohio.\n\n1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:17.360\n And real guy, worked at ADP payroll to this day,\n\n1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:19.740\n works at ADP, is where the guy works.\n\n1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:22.660\n Got the driver's license.\n\n1:25:22.660 --> 1:25:24.360\n And to me, at that point in time,\n\n1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:27.160\n it was the prettiest thing that I'd ever seen.\n\n1:25:27.160 --> 1:25:29.540\n You know, I'd never seen a fake ID before.\n\n1:25:29.540 --> 1:25:30.840\n I thought it was great.\n\n1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:33.680\n Turns out, you know, looking back, it was like, eh.\n\n1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:35.320\n So, but.\n\n1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:39.600\n That is kind of a strong first step\n\n1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:42.560\n in creating a fake identity.\n\n1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:44.120\n Very strong, very strong.\n\n1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:47.160\n So this is. So that was like, Gasko just,\n\n1:25:48.360 --> 1:25:53.360\n on the point he made, that if you're gonna be successful\n\n1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:56.640\n in this, you should have people you trust.\n\n1:25:56.640 --> 1:25:58.000\n Is he right on that?\n\n1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.040\n Oh, he's absolutely right.\n\n1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:00.880\n He's absolute.\n\n1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:03.680\n So you have to have, this is like mob.\n\n1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:04.520\n You have to.\n\n1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:07.480\n You have to have an inner circle that you trust.\n\n1:26:07.480 --> 1:26:08.800\n You know, I'm sure you've probably\n\n1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:10.240\n heard me say this before.\n\n1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:14.560\n Successful cyber crime, all right?\n\n1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:17.580\n There are three necessities to being successful online\n\n1:26:17.580 --> 1:26:18.520\n if you're a criminal.\n\n1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:21.080\n Three necessities are gathering data,\n\n1:26:21.080 --> 1:26:24.240\n committing the crime, and then cashing it out.\n\n1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:26.720\n All three of those necessities have to work in conjunction.\n\n1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:28.440\n If they don't, the crime fails.\n\n1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:30.760\n The problem, and it's a huge problem,\n\n1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:34.880\n is that one guy can't do all three things.\n\n1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:37.040\n You know, you've got the people who gather the data.\n\n1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:39.680\n Basically, the general store sells people\n\n1:26:39.680 --> 1:26:44.480\n who sell PII, credit card logins, data tools.\n\n1:26:44.480 --> 1:26:46.220\n They always sell the spoofed phone numbers\n\n1:26:46.220 --> 1:26:48.560\n and the RDPs, stuff like that.\n\n1:26:48.560 --> 1:26:49.800\n A lot of the times, those people don't know\n\n1:26:49.800 --> 1:26:51.080\n how to commit the crime.\n\n1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:52.200\n And those people certainly don't know\n\n1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:54.640\n how to launder the money out, put cash in pocket.\n\n1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:58.000\n So you've got, either because of a skill level,\n\n1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.160\n sometimes a geographic location,\n\n1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:03.240\n limits what that individual can do, all right?\n\n1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:06.600\n So you have to rely on people who are good in areas\n\n1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:10.640\n where you are not in order for that crime to succeed.\n\n1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:15.380\n And that means you have to trust those people.\n\n1:27:15.380 --> 1:27:17.760\n So what happens with Shadow Crew, all right?\n\n1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:20.160\n So Counterfeit Library is the start, all right?\n\n1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:24.520\n Counterfeit Library transitions over to Shadow Crew.\n\n1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:27.880\n Right before that transition, there's a Ukrainian guy.\n\n1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:29.600\n By the name of Dmitry Golubov.\n\n1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:31.240\n He was a spammer at that point in time.\n\n1:27:31.240 --> 1:27:34.320\n He saw what we were doing with Counterfeit Library\n\n1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:35.960\n and he liked it.\n\n1:27:35.960 --> 1:27:37.760\n He was getting all these credit card details\n\n1:27:37.760 --> 1:27:39.940\n and this kid, I mean, he's a kid.\n\n1:27:39.940 --> 1:27:41.280\n This kid has an idea.\n\n1:27:41.280 --> 1:27:43.560\n And his idea was, I wonder if people would buy\n\n1:27:43.560 --> 1:27:45.200\n stolen credit card details.\n\n1:27:45.200 --> 1:27:47.600\n That's pretty good Ukrainian Russian accent.\n\n1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:52.200\n So he picks up the phone, he calls his buddies.\n\n1:27:52.200 --> 1:27:53.300\n They call their buddies.\n\n1:27:53.300 --> 1:27:56.240\n They have a physical conference in Odessa.\n\n1:27:56.240 --> 1:27:58.440\n 150 of these cyber criminals show up.\n\n1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:00.200\n And they launched this idea,\n\n1:28:00.200 --> 1:28:03.080\n this launches a website called Carter Planet,\n\n1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:06.040\n which is the genesis of all modern credit card theft\n\n1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:07.440\n as we know it, all right?\n\n1:28:07.440 --> 1:28:10.680\n And so, remember I mentioned those three necessities\n\n1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:11.580\n of cyber crime.\n\n1:28:12.440 --> 1:28:16.040\n Dmitry had all the credit data in the world.\n\n1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:17.800\n And he partnered with all these other Ukrainians\n\n1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:19.560\n who had all this data as well.\n\n1:28:19.560 --> 1:28:22.240\n The problem was, is so much fraud had been committed\n\n1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:24.100\n on that Eastern side of Europe,\n\n1:28:24.100 --> 1:28:26.480\n that every card had been shut down.\n\n1:28:26.480 --> 1:28:28.880\n Even if you were a legitimate card holder\n\n1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:30.080\n and tried to cash it out,\n\n1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:32.040\n you weren't doing it at that point.\n\n1:28:32.040 --> 1:28:33.720\n So again, those three necessities,\n\n1:28:33.720 --> 1:28:35.840\n gathering data, committing crime, cashing out.\n\n1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:37.520\n Dmitry had the data.\n\n1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:38.960\n They could commit the crime.\n\n1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:41.640\n They could not put cash in pocket.\n\n1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:44.400\n So we were running counterfeit library.\n\n1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:46.120\n One day I get this message,\n\n1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:48.840\n or not a message, one day script shows up.\n\n1:28:48.840 --> 1:28:50.960\n And he posts just on the general forum.\n\n1:28:50.960 --> 1:28:54.280\n He posts, hey, I've got credit card data.\n\n1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:56.640\n Give me an address, give me a burner phone number,\n\n1:28:56.640 --> 1:28:58.960\n wait five business days, order whatever you want to.\n\n1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:01.360\n We had never seen anything like that.\n\n1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:03.680\n We were a PayPal fraud and eBay fraud site,\n\n1:29:03.680 --> 1:29:06.280\n is what we were, and fake driver's licenses.\n\n1:29:06.280 --> 1:29:07.560\n So then, and we had,\n\n1:29:07.560 --> 1:29:09.960\n I guess we had two, 3,000 members at that point.\n\n1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:14.960\n So the response from the members was, that can't be real.\n\n1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:17.600\n You've gotta be law enforcement.\n\n1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:21.080\n It's gotta be trying to get us arrested and everything else.\n\n1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:23.400\n What, let me backtrack a little bit.\n\n1:29:23.400 --> 1:29:27.160\n So the driver's license that I had got,\n\n1:29:27.160 --> 1:29:28.840\n Beelzebub had an idea.\n\n1:29:28.840 --> 1:29:33.400\n What he wanted to do is he wanted to sell driver's licenses.\n\n1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:36.680\n Mr. X wanted to sell social security cards.\n\n1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:39.240\n He made a very passable social security card.\n\n1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:40.960\n Me, I didn't, I had no skill level on that.\n\n1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:42.880\n I knew PayPal fraud and eBay fraud.\n\n1:29:42.880 --> 1:29:45.560\n So Beelzebub was like, I'll tell you what,\n\n1:29:45.560 --> 1:29:47.360\n you be the reviewer.\n\n1:29:47.360 --> 1:29:50.120\n That way you get every product or service that comes in.\n\n1:29:50.120 --> 1:29:53.040\n They'll have to send it to you or let you have access to it.\n\n1:29:53.040 --> 1:29:55.480\n You can learn the entire game.\n\n1:29:55.480 --> 1:29:57.880\n And because you're not selling anything,\n\n1:29:57.880 --> 1:30:01.400\n it gives you legitimacy on the reviews, all right?\n\n1:30:01.400 --> 1:30:02.640\n So I started out as a reviewer,\n\n1:30:02.640 --> 1:30:04.760\n the only reviewer on Counterfeit Library.\n\n1:30:05.640 --> 1:30:09.160\n So over the next year, Beelzebub turns out\n\n1:30:09.160 --> 1:30:10.120\n he was a pot grower.\n\n1:30:10.120 --> 1:30:11.800\n He goes back to growing pot\n\n1:30:11.800 --> 1:30:14.480\n because he wasn't making shit selling driver's licenses.\n\n1:30:14.480 --> 1:30:16.800\n Mr. X, about a year and a half in,\n\n1:30:16.800 --> 1:30:20.560\n he gets arrested cashing out driver's, not credit cards,\n\n1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:24.240\n cashing out to casinos, doing some shit with that.\n\n1:30:24.240 --> 1:30:26.200\n So I'm the only guy left standing\n\n1:30:26.200 --> 1:30:28.400\n and I'm at the top of the heap.\n\n1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:32.600\n And it becomes this thing where if I review somebody,\n\n1:30:32.600 --> 1:30:33.880\n they make a lot of money.\n\n1:30:33.880 --> 1:30:36.720\n If I don't, you don't do business here.\n\n1:30:36.720 --> 1:30:38.800\n So script shows up saying he's got this.\n\n1:30:38.800 --> 1:30:40.520\n I'm the only reviewer on site.\n\n1:30:41.480 --> 1:30:43.960\n People think he's law enforcement.\n\n1:30:43.960 --> 1:30:45.520\n First week it goes like that.\n\n1:30:45.520 --> 1:30:47.320\n After a while, I'm like, okay, I gotta do something.\n\n1:30:47.320 --> 1:30:48.240\n And I'm scared, man,\n\n1:30:48.240 --> 1:30:50.560\n because I'm like, he may be law enforcement.\n\n1:30:50.560 --> 1:30:52.040\n So I get him on ICQ and I'm like,\n\n1:30:52.040 --> 1:30:53.120\n hey, you have to be reviewed.\n\n1:30:53.120 --> 1:30:54.720\n He's like, what the hell is that?\n\n1:30:54.720 --> 1:30:56.840\n So I tell him what it is, he's like, you reviewed me.\n\n1:30:56.840 --> 1:30:58.520\n I was like, yeah, that's the idea.\n\n1:30:58.520 --> 1:31:02.040\n So give him a drop address, give him a burner phone number,\n\n1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:04.440\n wait five business days,\n\n1:31:04.440 --> 1:31:06.840\n and I try to hit Dell for $5,000.\n\n1:31:06.840 --> 1:31:08.160\n The order fails.\n\n1:31:08.160 --> 1:31:10.400\n I get back on ICQ, hey man, it didn't work.\n\n1:31:10.400 --> 1:31:12.000\n He's like, give me one more chance.\n\n1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:13.760\n I was like, look, I'll give you one more chance,\n\n1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:15.080\n but it's your ass after that.\n\n1:31:15.080 --> 1:31:16.720\n He's like, one more chance.\n\n1:31:16.720 --> 1:31:20.080\n I go, okay, give him another address, another phone number,\n\n1:31:20.080 --> 1:31:22.400\n wait another five business days,\n\n1:31:22.400 --> 1:31:25.320\n hit Thompson's Computer Warehouse for $4,000,\n\n1:31:25.320 --> 1:31:26.880\n Dell for $5,000.\n\n1:31:26.880 --> 1:31:28.880\n Order goes through, get the products in.\n\n1:31:29.800 --> 1:31:33.880\n I post that review on Counterfeit Library,\n\n1:31:33.880 --> 1:31:35.600\n and literally overnight,\n\n1:31:35.600 --> 1:31:38.240\n we turn from an eBay PayPal fraud site\n\n1:31:38.240 --> 1:31:40.000\n to a credit theft site.\n\n1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:44.160\n And that becomes a lot of money really quickly for members.\n\n1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:46.760\n So we were doing, now it's called CMP fraud,\n\n1:31:46.760 --> 1:31:47.720\n card not present fraud.\n\n1:31:47.720 --> 1:31:49.720\n So you hit an online merchant\n\n1:31:49.720 --> 1:31:51.280\n with stolen credit card data.\n\n1:31:51.280 --> 1:31:54.560\n Back then, a fairly experienced fraudster\n\n1:31:54.560 --> 1:31:58.640\n could profit 30 to $40,000 a month, okay?\n\n1:31:58.640 --> 1:32:00.800\n Just buying laptops, what have you,\n\n1:32:00.800 --> 1:32:03.080\n and cashing out, put them on eBay for sale\n\n1:32:03.080 --> 1:32:03.920\n and sell them like that.\n\n1:32:03.920 --> 1:32:06.880\n And 30 to 40K a month was the profit on that.\n\n1:32:06.880 --> 1:32:08.520\n Script had a lot of buddies.\n\n1:32:08.520 --> 1:32:11.000\n He had people like Roman Vega,\n\n1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:12.520\n these other guys that would sell\n\n1:32:12.520 --> 1:32:14.120\n not just credit card data,\n\n1:32:14.120 --> 1:32:17.280\n but counterfeit physical credit cards as well.\n\n1:32:17.280 --> 1:32:18.480\n We had, and he.\n\n1:32:18.480 --> 1:32:20.080\n Counterfeit, not stolen.\n\n1:32:20.080 --> 1:32:21.000\n So counterfeit.\n\n1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:22.600\n Counterfeit.\n\n1:32:22.600 --> 1:32:25.160\n That must be tough to do.\n\n1:32:25.160 --> 1:32:26.000\n So the connection.\n\n1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:28.280\n That must be harder than driver's licenses.\n\n1:32:28.280 --> 1:32:29.120\n It's crazy.\n\n1:32:29.120 --> 1:32:32.680\n So what BOA initially had,\n\n1:32:32.680 --> 1:32:37.160\n and I became the United States salesperson for BOA,\n\n1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:38.240\n but what he had was,\n\n1:32:38.240 --> 1:32:42.440\n is he was the first dumps provider in the United States.\n\n1:32:42.440 --> 1:32:44.640\n So on the back of your credit or debit card,\n\n1:32:44.640 --> 1:32:47.120\n there's a magnetic stripe.\n\n1:32:47.120 --> 1:32:48.440\n Three data tracks on the stripe.\n\n1:32:48.440 --> 1:32:50.400\n There was the first data track is the customer's name.\n\n1:32:50.400 --> 1:32:52.640\n Second data track is the card number,\n\n1:32:52.640 --> 1:32:56.080\n forward slash 16 digit algorithm outside of that.\n\n1:32:56.080 --> 1:32:56.920\n That's important.\n\n1:32:56.920 --> 1:32:58.560\n We'll get back to that in a few minutes.\n\n1:32:58.560 --> 1:33:00.560\n Third data track is called indiscriminate data.\n\n1:33:00.560 --> 1:33:02.600\n No one uses it, all right?\n\n1:33:02.600 --> 1:33:05.760\n So what's bought and sold is the second data track.\n\n1:33:05.760 --> 1:33:06.920\n It's called the dump.\n\n1:33:06.920 --> 1:33:10.120\n And the reason that's sold is when you go into a shop,\n\n1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:12.840\n you insert the card or you swipe the card,\n\n1:33:12.840 --> 1:33:15.320\n the only information that's sent out for verification\n\n1:33:15.320 --> 1:33:17.280\n is the second data track, all right?\n\n1:33:17.280 --> 1:33:19.760\n That goes to the processor bank for verification.\n\n1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:21.640\n The first data track, that customer's name,\n\n1:33:21.640 --> 1:33:24.640\n shows up on the screen of the cashier in front of you.\n\n1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:26.400\n So what typically happens is,\n\n1:33:26.400 --> 1:33:28.200\n is you buy 10 of these dumps.\n\n1:33:28.200 --> 1:33:30.560\n You get 10 counterfeit cards\n\n1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:32.440\n in code track two on all 10 cards.\n\n1:33:32.440 --> 1:33:35.320\n Track one, you create one fake driver's license.\n\n1:33:35.320 --> 1:33:36.680\n Track one is just the name\n\n1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:38.200\n of that one fake driver's license.\n\n1:33:38.200 --> 1:33:40.280\n That way, when you go in the shop, swipe the card,\n\n1:33:40.280 --> 1:33:42.120\n track two gets sent off for verification.\n\n1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:44.920\n Track one shows up on the screen in front of the cashier.\n\n1:33:44.920 --> 1:33:47.600\n If you ever ask for ID, you pull out the fake ID.\n\n1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:48.880\n Everyone's a nice, warm, fuzzy.\n\n1:33:48.880 --> 1:33:51.240\n You walk out with the cameras, Rolex.\n\n1:33:51.240 --> 1:33:54.120\n And track one could be, it doesn't have to be connected.\n\n1:33:54.120 --> 1:33:55.120\n It's not connected to track two.\n\n1:33:55.120 --> 1:33:57.320\n Not connected at all, all right?\n\n1:33:57.320 --> 1:33:59.880\n That's one of the big problems, all right?\n\n1:33:59.880 --> 1:34:04.880\n So Scrip brought a host of technical people\n\n1:34:05.560 --> 1:34:07.000\n into that type of environment,\n\n1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:08.520\n all committing credit card theft.\n\n1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:10.200\n We had proxy providers.\n\n1:34:10.200 --> 1:34:13.080\n We had all these people that were doing this stuff.\n\n1:34:13.080 --> 1:34:15.560\n We start making a lot of money, a lot.\n\n1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:17.680\n And the reason that happens is, again,\n\n1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:21.160\n Scrip did not have the ability to cash out.\n\n1:34:21.160 --> 1:34:23.600\n So he was reduced to selling things.\n\n1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:25.160\n And at the same time, he's looking for,\n\n1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:27.160\n how do I make more money, all right?\n\n1:34:28.120 --> 1:34:31.520\n The Ukrainians happened upon this thing\n\n1:34:31.520 --> 1:34:34.440\n called the CVV1 breach, or hack,\n\n1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:36.120\n is what they called it.\n\n1:34:36.120 --> 1:34:39.120\n So what happens is, remember I told you track two,\n\n1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:43.440\n card number forward slash 16 digit algorithm.\n\n1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:46.320\n You gotta know the algorithm to encode it\n\n1:34:46.320 --> 1:34:49.360\n so you can swipe the card or take it to the ATM machine.\n\n1:34:49.360 --> 1:34:50.360\n All right, ATM.\n\n1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:52.800\n You gotta know it.\n\n1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:54.840\n Now we were fishing data from hell.\n\n1:34:54.840 --> 1:34:58.600\n I mean, we were doing a lot of fishing, a lot.\n\n1:34:58.600 --> 1:35:01.360\n We were getting pins, we were getting card numbers,\n\n1:35:01.360 --> 1:35:03.680\n but you can't get that algorithm.\n\n1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:07.000\n So Ukrainians start testing stuff.\n\n1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:10.240\n What they found out was no bank\n\n1:35:10.240 --> 1:35:13.640\n had implemented the hash on track two.\n\n1:35:13.640 --> 1:35:17.600\n So you take the card number forward slash any 16 digits,\n\n1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:19.360\n it would encode.\n\n1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:21.840\n Take it to the ATM, pull cash out,\n\n1:35:21.840 --> 1:35:24.280\n because you got the pin, all right?\n\n1:35:24.280 --> 1:35:26.320\n Started doing that.\n\n1:35:26.320 --> 1:35:28.680\n Well, wait, sorry, I'm trying to understand.\n\n1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:32.960\n So that means, so if there's no hash,\n\n1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:34.680\n are they generating random numbers\n\n1:35:34.680 --> 1:35:37.120\n or do they have valid numbers for track two?\n\n1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:38.320\n No numbers needed at all,\n\n1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:41.840\n as long as just the track two was a complete track two.\n\n1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:45.680\n So it's a valid track two that doesn't match,\n\n1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:48.560\n so the pin is the thing that gets you in?\n\n1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:50.240\n So back then, all right, back then,\n\n1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:52.120\n what we're talking about is you needed,\n\n1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:54.320\n typically today you need a whole track two.\n\n1:35:54.320 --> 1:35:55.800\n You need that valid track two.\n\n1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:59.040\n All right, you need the 16 digit card number,\n\n1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:01.320\n forward slash, and then whatever that algorithm\n\n1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:03.160\n does, the other side of it, all right?\n\n1:36:03.160 --> 1:36:06.760\n Back then, none of the banks had implemented that algorithm.\n\n1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:08.920\n So while the algorithm was there,\n\n1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:11.360\n you didn't need it to encode.\n\n1:36:13.640 --> 1:36:14.480\n Interesting.\n\n1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:15.920\n Interesting.\n\n1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:20.920\n So you can make a lot of money with physical of fake.\n\n1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:24.000\n So much money that card not present fraud.\n\n1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:25.520\n Card not present fraud, remember I told you,\n\n1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:28.320\n was $30,000 to $40,000 a month, all right?\n\n1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:32.560\n That turned into $30,000 to $40,000 a day.\n\n1:36:32.560 --> 1:36:35.560\n The Ukrainians, again, they can't cash it out.\n\n1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:38.240\n They've got all the data on the planet,\n\n1:36:38.240 --> 1:36:39.240\n but they can't cash it out,\n\n1:36:39.240 --> 1:36:41.400\n those three necessities of cybercrime.\n\n1:36:41.400 --> 1:36:44.600\n So the deal became, you have to rely on the Americans.\n\n1:36:44.600 --> 1:36:46.600\n Tell you what, we'll give you 40%.\n\n1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:48.080\n So you had all these cashiers\n\n1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:51.160\n that were 40% of $40,000 a day.\n\n1:36:51.160 --> 1:36:53.360\n Yeah, we'll take that, all right?\n\n1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:55.560\n Send the rest of it over to buy Western Union\n\n1:36:55.560 --> 1:36:57.880\n or what have you to your Ukrainian contact.\n\n1:36:57.880 --> 1:36:59.720\n That's before cryptocurrency came into play.\n\n1:36:59.720 --> 1:37:01.000\n Now you had a couple of forerunners\n\n1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:04.320\n with eGold and Liberty Reserve, things like that.\n\n1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:07.680\n But back then it starts out with Western Union,\n\n1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:09.360\n then it becomes prepaid cards,\n\n1:37:09.360 --> 1:37:11.120\n sending track information over,\n\n1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:12.440\n loading the card up like that,\n\n1:37:12.440 --> 1:37:14.480\n and then finally you get to eGold, Liberty Reserve,\n\n1:37:14.480 --> 1:37:17.320\n and then today it's with crypto that's used.\n\n1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:23.240\n Started stealing a lot of money, a lot.\n\n1:37:23.240 --> 1:37:26.560\n And that got law enforcement attention.\n\n1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:30.400\n So we started to see, I mean, it's a crazy ass story.\n\n1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:33.600\n We started to see IPs coming in\n\n1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:35.640\n from law enforcement agencies, government agencies,\n\n1:37:35.640 --> 1:37:36.760\n because back then they didn't know\n\n1:37:36.760 --> 1:37:38.280\n how to shield their identity either.\n\n1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:42.080\n So you saw Secret Service, you saw DoD,\n\n1:37:42.080 --> 1:37:44.520\n you saw all these like, and you're like,\n\n1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:45.480\n that's interesting.\n\n1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:49.280\n So, you know, and at the same time,\n\n1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:54.120\n it was called a hack, but it wasn't a hack.\n\n1:37:54.120 --> 1:37:58.840\n We had a guy that worked at T Mobile in Los Angeles.\n\n1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:01.240\n This is the same guy that back then\n\n1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:04.640\n published Paris Hilton's phone contact list.\n\n1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:06.080\n That made a lot of news.\n\n1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:09.800\n Not only did he do that, but it turned out\n\n1:38:09.800 --> 1:38:12.440\n that the Los Angeles Secret Service Agency\n\n1:38:12.440 --> 1:38:14.240\n was using T Mobile phones.\n\n1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:17.960\n So he's getting text messages of the Secret Service\n\n1:38:17.960 --> 1:38:19.960\n investigating Shadow Crew,\n\n1:38:19.960 --> 1:38:21.840\n and he posts those damn things on Shadow Crew.\n\n1:38:21.840 --> 1:38:23.920\n So I'm sitting there going, head of the pile,\n\n1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:27.040\n I'm sitting there going, this is not gonna end well.\n\n1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:28.600\n This is not gonna end well.\n\n1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:31.400\n So at the same time, I had access,\n\n1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:33.080\n I started out with access\n\n1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:35.720\n to the Indiana State Sex Offenders Registry,\n\n1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:37.880\n and I was using that to create bank accounts,\n\n1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:39.720\n launder the money out, and I would sell the bank accounts,\n\n1:38:39.720 --> 1:38:40.560\n stuff like that.\n\n1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:43.160\n They shut that down.\n\n1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:44.960\n The next database I had access to\n\n1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:47.640\n was the Texas Driver's License database,\n\n1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:51.080\n and started using that to create fake driver's licenses,\n\n1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:52.120\n what have you.\n\n1:38:52.120 --> 1:38:54.440\n And then finally, we happened upon\n\n1:38:54.440 --> 1:38:57.840\n the California Death Index, all right?\n\n1:38:58.840 --> 1:39:00.800\n Complete information, mother's maiden,\n\n1:39:00.800 --> 1:39:04.680\n socials, DOBs, all that, and it's like,\n\n1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:06.280\n gotta be a use for that.\n\n1:39:06.280 --> 1:39:09.680\n Well, you can use it to create identities all day long.\n\n1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:14.680\n My idea was, I wonder if you could take somebody\n\n1:39:14.840 --> 1:39:18.480\n that's died and then file for social security death benefit,\n\n1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:20.360\n not death benefits, but social security benefits\n\n1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:23.200\n for that individual, and get that recurring paycheck in.\n\n1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:24.680\n So that takes a lot of research\n\n1:39:24.680 --> 1:39:26.760\n to start seeing if you can do that.\n\n1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:29.440\n How does the federal government know if you're dead?\n\n1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:32.680\n Do federal indexes reference state indexes?\n\n1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:34.920\n You got all these questions that pop up.\n\n1:39:34.920 --> 1:39:36.760\n Well, it turns out, federal indexes\n\n1:39:36.760 --> 1:39:39.760\n don't reference state indexes, it's against the law.\n\n1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:42.200\n It also turns out, the only way the federal government\n\n1:39:42.200 --> 1:39:46.120\n knows you're dead is prior to 1998,\n\n1:39:46.120 --> 1:39:51.000\n the family had to file a social security death benefit\n\n1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.800\n for that person, all right?\n\n1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:54.640\n Prior to 98.\n\n1:39:54.640 --> 1:39:56.040\n Which of course most people don't.\n\n1:39:56.040 --> 1:39:58.560\n Right, prior to 98, it took the family.\n\n1:39:58.560 --> 1:40:01.200\n After 98, the hospital can do it,\n\n1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:03.560\n funeral home can do it, or the family can do it.\n\n1:40:03.560 --> 1:40:05.840\n So a lot more people have it filed after,\n\n1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:06.680\n if they've died after.\n\n1:40:06.680 --> 1:40:08.320\n But it's still, there's a lot of people\n\n1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:09.840\n who probably don't. A lot of people don't.\n\n1:40:09.840 --> 1:40:13.960\n Because that death benefit's only like $219, okay?\n\n1:40:13.960 --> 1:40:15.960\n Nobody's thinking about that shit.\n\n1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:19.840\n So I started to apply for social security benefits.\n\n1:40:19.840 --> 1:40:21.760\n Nope, number's dormant.\n\n1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:23.760\n So they want you to come in for a physical interview.\n\n1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:26.480\n Here I am, you know, 32.\n\n1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:29.600\n You're not gonna pass as a 65 year old, so no.\n\n1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:31.580\n So the next idea I had was,\n\n1:40:32.920 --> 1:40:34.800\n I wonder if you could file income tax returns\n\n1:40:34.800 --> 1:40:35.640\n on these people.\n\n1:40:37.080 --> 1:40:40.400\n Turns out you can, all day long.\n\n1:40:40.400 --> 1:40:42.120\n So I started doing that.\n\n1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:45.080\n And I started to steal, once I got ramped up,\n\n1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:46.280\n because you test everything.\n\n1:40:46.280 --> 1:40:47.720\n You know, you're testing to make sure,\n\n1:40:47.720 --> 1:40:50.400\n you gotta figure out what the deposit instrument is\n\n1:40:50.400 --> 1:40:51.240\n and everything else.\n\n1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:53.240\n And once you get all that lined out,\n\n1:40:53.240 --> 1:40:55.960\n I started to steal $160,000 a week,\n\n1:40:55.960 --> 1:40:58.520\n every week for 10 months out of the year.\n\n1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:00.800\n By paying taxes?\n\n1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:03.120\n By filing fake returns.\n\n1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:05.120\n Yeah, filing fake tax returns.\n\n1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:07.680\n So you find a business, and the way the system worked\n\n1:41:07.680 --> 1:41:11.760\n is the IRS will issue a refund on somebody\n\n1:41:11.760 --> 1:41:13.120\n before they're able to verify\n\n1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:15.360\n that that person worked for an employer.\n\n1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:17.440\n Still works like that today.\n\n1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:18.440\n All right, so.\n\n1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:20.560\n And you're keeping the amounts relatively low.\n\n1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:22.600\n Keep them at $3,000.\n\n1:41:22.600 --> 1:41:23.440\n All right.\n\n1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:24.280\n Amounts are very low.\n\n1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:25.680\n But you're still able to achieve scale\n\n1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:27.200\n because this large index of real people.\n\n1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:28.920\n I got to where, and I was manual.\n\n1:41:28.920 --> 1:41:30.280\n Later on, a couple buddies of mine\n\n1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:31.520\n went automated with it.\n\n1:41:31.520 --> 1:41:32.960\n Wait, you were doing this by hand?\n\n1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:34.760\n So there's no code involved?\n\n1:41:34.760 --> 1:41:35.720\n All manual.\n\n1:41:35.720 --> 1:41:36.560\n Wow.\n\n1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:38.240\n I'd file a return once every six minutes.\n\n1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:42.120\n Work 10 hours a day, three days a week.\n\n1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:44.680\n So clicking on, so typing fast and clicking.\n\n1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:46.560\n One return every six minutes.\n\n1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:47.880\n That's changing IP.\n\n1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:49.320\n That's changing address.\n\n1:41:49.320 --> 1:41:51.640\n Everything else, one return every six minutes.\n\n1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:54.040\n For three days a week.\n\n1:41:54.040 --> 1:41:57.040\n Fourth day, I would take a road trip,\n\n1:41:57.040 --> 1:41:59.280\n plot out a map of ATMs.\n\n1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:01.520\n And then the next two days, cash out.\n\n1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:02.880\n Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.\n\n1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:03.720\n All right.\n\n1:42:03.720 --> 1:42:05.200\n Come back home, rinse and repeat.\n\n1:42:06.240 --> 1:42:08.040\n Turns out that a backpack,\n\n1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:09.320\n I don't see anybody sitting around here,\n\n1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:12.960\n but a backpack will hold $150,000 of 20s,\n\n1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:14.400\n is what it will hold.\n\n1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:16.680\n So I'd put 150K and 20s in a backpack.\n\n1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:18.240\n I had a spare bedroom.\n\n1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:21.040\n I'd come in, toss the backpack in the bedroom.\n\n1:42:21.040 --> 1:42:23.080\n This is very, very important information.\n\n1:42:23.080 --> 1:42:25.360\n And the fact that you know it is also very,\n\n1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:27.920\n first we started with the volume of coal that weighs a ton,\n\n1:42:27.920 --> 1:42:32.280\n and now a backpack holds $150,000 of 20s.\n\n1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:35.320\n And then you can multiply that by five 400s.\n\n1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:36.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:36.240 --> 1:42:37.080\n I like this.\n\n1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:39.680\n It's also times 20s coming out of ATM, right?\n\n1:42:39.680 --> 1:42:42.000\n Each 20 weighs a gram.\n\n1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:43.840\n Each 20 weighs a gram.\n\n1:42:43.840 --> 1:42:45.480\n So you can actually go by weight,\n\n1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:47.320\n which is what federal authorities do\n\n1:42:47.320 --> 1:42:49.920\n when they get a pallet of cash, they just weigh it.\n\n1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:52.200\n Oh, they just, they just weigh it.\n\n1:42:52.200 --> 1:42:55.720\n So 150K is seven and a half keys of cash.\n\n1:42:55.720 --> 1:42:59.440\n One and a half, 15, oh, that's pretty light.\n\n1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:00.280\n Not bad, not bad.\n\n1:43:00.280 --> 1:43:02.080\n Yeah, you get a big backpack,\n\n1:43:02.080 --> 1:43:05.120\n go do a good run with David Goggins with it.\n\n1:43:05.120 --> 1:43:05.960\n I like it.\n\n1:43:05.960 --> 1:43:08.560\n The fact that you know this is great.\n\n1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:11.320\n So wait, where does that come in with the backpack?\n\n1:43:11.320 --> 1:43:14.040\n So what happens is I didn't know how to launder money.\n\n1:43:14.040 --> 1:43:17.280\n All right, so I'm throwing cash in the spare bedroom.\n\n1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:20.320\n One day you open up the bedroom and you're like,\n\n1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:22.120\n gotta do something with those backpacks.\n\n1:43:22.120 --> 1:43:25.200\n And that's when you start learning how to launder money,\n\n1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:26.880\n cash based businesses, things like that.\n\n1:43:26.880 --> 1:43:28.040\n I had a production company,\n\n1:43:28.040 --> 1:43:29.560\n had a couple of detailing company.\n\n1:43:29.560 --> 1:43:31.900\n I was thinking about going into food trucks,\n\n1:43:31.900 --> 1:43:33.080\n things like that in Charleston.\n\n1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:35.240\n Actually, can you pause on that to take a tangent there?\n\n1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:39.080\n How does money laundering work?\n\n1:43:39.080 --> 1:43:42.240\n I mean, at that time and what years are we talking about?\n\n1:43:42.240 --> 1:43:46.840\n This is, by the time the tax return schemes go into play,\n\n1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:51.000\n we're talking 2002, 2003 is when tax returns start.\n\n1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:54.920\n And so what, at that time and what you're aware of now,\n\n1:43:54.920 --> 1:43:58.340\n how it evolved, how does money laundering work?\n\n1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:00.640\n You know, it's not that much different.\n\n1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:02.200\n It's really not.\n\n1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:04.160\n You get a cash based business,\n\n1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:06.160\n start laundering the money or putting the money through that,\n\n1:44:06.160 --> 1:44:08.080\n saying the transactions are legal.\n\n1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:11.160\n You then start depositing into bank accounts.\n\n1:44:11.160 --> 1:44:14.520\n From bank accounts, my thing was is\n\n1:44:15.880 --> 1:44:19.920\n have bank accounts in the United States, Mexico, Canada,\n\n1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:22.400\n and then finally bounce over to Estonia\n\n1:44:22.400 --> 1:44:24.040\n was the final destination of all this stuff.\n\n1:44:24.040 --> 1:44:28.480\n And the idea is to try to move them to so many places\n\n1:44:28.480 --> 1:44:31.200\n that by the end of the day, it looks legal\n\n1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:34.480\n and you can't trace it all if you're ever caught,\n\n1:44:34.480 --> 1:44:36.280\n which you ultimately are.\n\n1:44:36.280 --> 1:44:38.400\n But so cash based businesses, you know.\n\n1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:40.040\n So when you say, sorry to interrupt,\n\n1:44:40.040 --> 1:44:41.800\n the cash based businesses,\n\n1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:46.800\n so you have money that needs to be moved to other people.\n\n1:44:48.680 --> 1:44:49.600\n So how does that work?\n\n1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:50.880\n What's the business?\n\n1:44:50.880 --> 1:44:52.640\n Are people providing you a service\n\n1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:54.320\n and you're giving them money?\n\n1:44:54.320 --> 1:44:57.440\n Right, so you do the Ozark thing if you wanna do that.\n\n1:44:57.440 --> 1:44:59.640\n So you can gamble, cash out something like that.\n\n1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:02.560\n So it trips to whatever casinos you've got.\n\n1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:05.880\n You've got your production company or your detail company.\n\n1:45:05.880 --> 1:45:08.080\n So how many cars are you cleaning a day?\n\n1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:10.280\n How many companies have you got to do that?\n\n1:45:10.280 --> 1:45:12.680\n All right, whatever that company is,\n\n1:45:12.680 --> 1:45:13.760\n it's gotta be cash based.\n\n1:45:13.760 --> 1:45:16.960\n Somebody's paying you in cash is what you're doing.\n\n1:45:16.960 --> 1:45:19.040\n You have to have enough of those cash based businesses\n\n1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:21.200\n where it doesn't look funny.\n\n1:45:21.200 --> 1:45:23.160\n All right, because if you're a detail company\n\n1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:26.000\n making $100,000 a month, that's a problem.\n\n1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:30.320\n Okay, so then you start depositing into that.\n\n1:45:30.320 --> 1:45:33.200\n Well, because of the Patriot Act,\n\n1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:37.760\n a suspicious activity report, SARS, came in at $2,500\n\n1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:40.360\n instead of the 10K that it used to be.\n\n1:45:40.360 --> 1:45:42.240\n So all of a sudden you've got multiple bank accounts\n\n1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:44.680\n that you've got to set up, all right?\n\n1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:46.320\n Fortunately, what you also had\n\n1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:47.960\n is you had a bunch of prepaid debit cards\n\n1:45:47.960 --> 1:45:49.840\n that were coming into play at the same time.\n\n1:45:49.840 --> 1:45:53.760\n So a combination of bank accounts, prepaid debits\n\n1:45:53.760 --> 1:45:56.480\n that had ACH abilities attached to those as well,\n\n1:45:56.480 --> 1:45:58.360\n and you start running them all together.\n\n1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:00.240\n Then once it's out of the United States,\n\n1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:01.320\n you don't have to worry as much.\n\n1:46:01.320 --> 1:46:05.320\n You can start funneling that into fewer bank accounts\n\n1:46:05.320 --> 1:46:07.640\n until finally you've got the one main account\n\n1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:11.280\n that's over at Bank Letico in Estonia at that point.\n\n1:46:11.280 --> 1:46:12.960\n That's what you've got.\n\n1:46:12.960 --> 1:46:15.400\n So a bunch of hops that end up at a place\n\n1:46:15.400 --> 1:46:16.360\n that you can't trace.\n\n1:46:16.360 --> 1:46:19.840\n And to give you an idea, I was arrested February 8th, 2005.\n\n1:46:19.840 --> 1:46:22.920\n My last seizure was 2010.\n\n1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:24.320\n Got the last seizure notice.\n\n1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:28.760\n So they got it, but it didn't took them that long\n\n1:46:28.760 --> 1:46:30.320\n to get to it.\n\n1:46:30.320 --> 1:46:34.400\n So how do stories like with Script that come into play here\n\n1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:38.680\n where he had someone who owed him money\n\n1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:40.080\n kidnapped and tortured.\n\n1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:45.080\n So when does it turn darker?\n\n1:46:45.160 --> 1:46:48.800\n It turns darker the more money you make.\n\n1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:52.840\n Script was a kid that he was stealing enough money\n\n1:46:52.840 --> 1:46:55.120\n that he was able to buy whatever estate he wanted to.\n\n1:46:55.120 --> 1:46:58.000\n And he would brag about touring the countryside.\n\n1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:00.960\n And if he saw property that he liked, he would buy it.\n\n1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:03.880\n And that was not just a brag, he was doing that.\n\n1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:05.800\n So this kid is stealing a lot of money.\n\n1:47:05.800 --> 1:47:08.640\n At the same time, he's got connections politically\n\n1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:10.960\n because of his family, he's got connections\n\n1:47:10.960 --> 1:47:13.560\n and that family's got connections with a Ukrainian mob.\n\n1:47:13.560 --> 1:47:16.240\n All right, so he's got these inroads\n\n1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:17.760\n and people are looking out for him\n\n1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:20.040\n and he's stealing a lot of money at the same time.\n\n1:47:20.040 --> 1:47:24.400\n Somebody doesn't pay him a decent amount of money.\n\n1:47:24.400 --> 1:47:25.400\n Somebody doesn't pay him.\n\n1:47:25.400 --> 1:47:29.400\n Now we had never, with Shadow Crew, with Carter Planet,\n\n1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:33.240\n with Counterfeit Library, we were basically the geeks.\n\n1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:35.360\n All right, we were just the fraudsters,\n\n1:47:35.360 --> 1:47:36.880\n the social engineers.\n\n1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:38.880\n We had never really considered violence.\n\n1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:40.560\n The rules that I had in play were,\n\n1:47:40.560 --> 1:47:43.160\n hey, we don't do child pornography,\n\n1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:46.800\n we don't do counterfeit currency, we don't do drugs.\n\n1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:48.880\n And the only thing we ended up really obeying\n\n1:47:48.880 --> 1:47:51.640\n was the child porn stuff, except for Max Butler,\n\n1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:52.880\n who you mentioned earlier.\n\n1:47:54.520 --> 1:47:57.240\n Script, someone rips the guy off.\n\n1:47:57.240 --> 1:48:02.240\n And he comes online on Shadow Crew at that point\n\n1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:04.320\n and he posts these pictures one day.\n\n1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:07.280\n And I mean, it was a detailed narrative through the pictures.\n\n1:48:07.280 --> 1:48:10.320\n Had the guy that rammed in the van,\n\n1:48:10.320 --> 1:48:12.720\n he had the door open, rammed in the van,\n\n1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:15.800\n had the guy tied up, had the guy being tortured.\n\n1:48:15.800 --> 1:48:20.240\n And the response was, this is what happens\n\n1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:22.480\n when you steal from me.\n\n1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:27.480\n And that's the first time that violence came into play\n\n1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:29.960\n at that point, and that's when things got,\n\n1:48:29.960 --> 1:48:32.600\n you start realizing things are getting a little serious.\n\n1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:34.680\n How did that make you feel?\n\n1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:38.080\n The first response is, can't be real.\n\n1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:42.040\n He's just doing that.\n\n1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:44.160\n You know, he's wanting to send a message.\n\n1:48:44.160 --> 1:48:48.360\n Then you're like, no, that's real, that's real.\n\n1:48:49.960 --> 1:48:52.000\n Were you afraid in your own heart\n\n1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:55.160\n that you might descend to that too?\n\n1:48:55.160 --> 1:48:58.480\n Like if you see that, or was it pretty clear to you\n\n1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:02.320\n that that's a line that some people can cross\n\n1:49:02.320 --> 1:49:05.040\n and some can't and you're not one of those that can cross it?\n\n1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:07.760\n You know, I gotta tell you, I joke with my wife.\n\n1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:13.040\n The joke I tell my wife is, you know,\n\n1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:15.960\n I knew some guy that had 8,000 Bitcoins.\n\n1:49:15.960 --> 1:49:19.560\n I might be persuaded to ask him for access to that.\n\n1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:20.400\n And she was like, how?\n\n1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:23.440\n And I was like, well, hammer and toes.\n\n1:49:23.440 --> 1:49:28.120\n And I say that as a joke,\n\n1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:32.160\n but there's that line where you're like,\n\n1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:34.200\n I remember who I used to be.\n\n1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:37.080\n And if you're looking at that kind of money,\n\n1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:41.560\n I might be persuaded to do that back then.\n\n1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:46.560\n You know, that's, and I think that was Scripps issue\n\n1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:49.160\n is it was a lot of money to him.\n\n1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:50.000\n There's the money.\n\n1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:53.240\n And then there's, you know, violence can also be gradual.\n\n1:49:53.240 --> 1:49:54.840\n So over time you do a little more, a little more,\n\n1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:56.840\n a little more, a little more.\n\n1:49:56.840 --> 1:49:58.400\n You get used to what's going on\n\n1:49:58.400 --> 1:49:59.680\n and then I get desensitized.\n\n1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:02.880\n And you figure, you take somebody like Ross Ulbricht,\n\n1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:04.880\n the Silk Road guy, all right.\n\n1:50:05.880 --> 1:50:08.040\n Ross was not a violent guy.\n\n1:50:08.040 --> 1:50:08.960\n He was not.\n\n1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:10.240\n But at that point in time, you know,\n\n1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:13.120\n he was sitting on 24 million in Bitcoin.\n\n1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:15.120\n He was the only game in town.\n\n1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:17.200\n And that 24 now is like, I don't know,\n\n1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:20.440\n 22, 24 billion, some crap like that.\n\n1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:24.960\n But he felt in danger.\n\n1:50:27.080 --> 1:50:28.640\n This guy was gonna turn him in.\n\n1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:29.920\n You know, it was a black mountain and everything.\n\n1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:34.800\n So Ross thinks he hires a couple hit men to kill the guy.\n\n1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:36.680\n So it becomes that thing.\n\n1:50:36.680 --> 1:50:38.520\n And I saw that over and over again.\n\n1:50:38.520 --> 1:50:41.240\n And I'd like to say I wasn't like that,\n\n1:50:41.240 --> 1:50:43.920\n but given the same circumstances,\n\n1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:46.280\n I would have probably done the same thing.\n\n1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:49.040\n And also when you're, it's not just about money,\n\n1:50:49.040 --> 1:50:50.200\n there's a lot of other forces.\n\n1:50:50.200 --> 1:50:54.400\n Like if you're threatened for your wellbeing\n\n1:50:54.400 --> 1:50:56.240\n or for your wealth or for your power,\n\n1:50:56.240 --> 1:50:59.240\n all of us operate under different motivations.\n\n1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:02.560\n Plus that online aspect with those communities like that,\n\n1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:03.920\n if you're the head guy,\n\n1:51:03.920 --> 1:51:06.320\n you really feel like you're the parent of these guys.\n\n1:51:06.320 --> 1:51:07.840\n So somebody is starting to threaten them,\n\n1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:10.360\n it's like, all right, what do I need to do?\n\n1:51:10.360 --> 1:51:12.000\n So what do you make of Silk Road?\n\n1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:16.400\n The Shadow Crew started something that today\n\n1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:19.520\n you can call dark net and dark net markets.\n\n1:51:19.520 --> 1:51:22.280\n So these markets that operate, that trade,\n\n1:51:23.600 --> 1:51:28.600\n trade things, everything from child pornography to drugs,\n\n1:51:28.600 --> 1:51:30.800\n to, I mean, what else?\n\n1:51:31.680 --> 1:51:32.520\n Everywhere.\n\n1:51:32.520 --> 1:51:34.640\n What are the dark things that humans want to do\n\n1:51:34.640 --> 1:51:36.640\n that they don't want anyone to know about?\n\n1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:37.920\n All of those things.\n\n1:51:39.920 --> 1:51:44.040\n So can you maybe tell me, you know what?\n\n1:51:44.040 --> 1:51:45.160\n Let's just even step back.\n\n1:51:45.160 --> 1:51:46.200\n What is the dark net?\n\n1:51:46.200 --> 1:51:47.600\n How big is it?\n\n1:51:47.600 --> 1:51:48.920\n What happens there?\n\n1:51:48.920 --> 1:51:51.960\n Let's backtrack a little bit more before we get to that.\n\n1:51:51.960 --> 1:51:55.560\n All right, what Shadow Crew did,\n\n1:51:56.720 --> 1:52:01.720\n other than dealing in all these stolen wares,\n\n1:52:01.720 --> 1:52:04.960\n what Shadow Crew did that's really important.\n\n1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:08.000\n Remember those three necessities that I talked about?\n\n1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:09.520\n But the important thing is,\n\n1:52:09.520 --> 1:52:13.200\n is it established trust among criminals, all right?\n\n1:52:13.200 --> 1:52:14.360\n Because that's a necessity.\n\n1:52:14.360 --> 1:52:17.440\n You have to be able to trust who you're dealing with\n\n1:52:17.440 --> 1:52:19.320\n because you have to deal with somebody.\n\n1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:21.240\n You have to, all right?\n\n1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:23.480\n So how do you know you're not dealing with a cop?\n\n1:52:23.480 --> 1:52:24.320\n How do you know you're dealing\n\n1:52:24.320 --> 1:52:25.520\n with somebody that's skilled?\n\n1:52:25.520 --> 1:52:26.640\n How do you know you're going to deal with somebody\n\n1:52:26.640 --> 1:52:27.960\n that's not going to rip you off?\n\n1:52:27.960 --> 1:52:30.040\n You have to be able to trust that individual.\n\n1:52:30.040 --> 1:52:31.160\n The Shadow Crew provided\n\n1:52:31.160 --> 1:52:33.000\n that trust mechanism for criminals.\n\n1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:35.840\n You had that communication channel, the forums,\n\n1:52:35.840 --> 1:52:38.880\n where you could reference conversations weeks, months old,\n\n1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:41.320\n take part and learn from those conversations.\n\n1:52:41.320 --> 1:52:44.080\n You had vouching systems and review systems in place,\n\n1:52:44.080 --> 1:52:46.080\n escrow systems in place.\n\n1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:49.720\n You knew by looking at someone's screen name,\n\n1:52:49.720 --> 1:52:51.520\n if you could trust the individual,\n\n1:52:51.520 --> 1:52:53.320\n network with the individual, all right?\n\n1:52:53.320 --> 1:52:57.560\n And that community of just humans\n\n1:52:57.560 --> 1:53:01.240\n provided that backbone of trust.\n\n1:53:01.240 --> 1:53:04.080\n And that's really interesting when you think about it.\n\n1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:05.520\n You had the trust that was there,\n\n1:53:05.520 --> 1:53:06.600\n but you also had this,\n\n1:53:08.400 --> 1:53:11.360\n almost this instantaneous information\n\n1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:13.640\n that was available about the community\n\n1:53:13.640 --> 1:53:15.440\n or about cyber crime at large.\n\n1:53:15.440 --> 1:53:18.080\n And that's still in play today, all right?\n\n1:53:18.080 --> 1:53:21.440\n So that was the way things were\n\n1:53:21.440 --> 1:53:23.160\n until a couple of things happened.\n\n1:53:23.160 --> 1:53:25.640\n And one was cryptocurrency.\n\n1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:29.000\n The other one was the Tor browser, the dark web.\n\n1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:30.920\n Now I was working with a secret service,\n\n1:53:30.920 --> 1:53:32.840\n ripping the secret service off,\n\n1:53:32.840 --> 1:53:34.840\n when Tor comes into play, all right?\n\n1:53:34.840 --> 1:53:37.080\n So we got a memo in one day\n\n1:53:37.080 --> 1:53:38.840\n and it was talking about the Tor browser.\n\n1:53:38.840 --> 1:53:41.840\n And it was like, we really need to be careful with this.\n\n1:53:41.840 --> 1:53:43.240\n This is going to be problem.\n\n1:53:43.240 --> 1:53:45.640\n And so we all fired up the Tor browser\n\n1:53:45.640 --> 1:53:50.480\n and it turns out it was, this was 2005, early six.\n\n1:53:50.480 --> 1:53:52.160\n It turns out it was completely unusable,\n\n1:53:52.160 --> 1:53:53.200\n could not use it at all,\n\n1:53:53.200 --> 1:53:55.080\n simply because no one was using it\n\n1:53:55.080 --> 1:53:56.440\n and it was extremely slow.\n\n1:53:56.440 --> 1:53:58.240\n So for people who don't know,\n\n1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:01.440\n Tor browser is a way to be completely anonymous.\n\n1:54:01.440 --> 1:54:04.920\n As long as you properly know how to use it, huge caveat.\n\n1:54:04.920 --> 1:54:07.840\n All right, so developed by the United States Navy\n\n1:54:07.840 --> 1:54:08.680\n and they developed it.\n\n1:54:08.680 --> 1:54:10.040\n I don't know this.\n\n1:54:10.040 --> 1:54:10.880\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:54:10.880 --> 1:54:13.280\n It wasn't the hackers that, interesting.\n\n1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:17.280\n US Navy, to this day, the number one funder of Tor,\n\n1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:20.400\n military, to this day, all right?\n\n1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:21.240\n Interesting.\n\n1:54:21.240 --> 1:54:22.440\n I mean, the same, I guess with the internet,\n\n1:54:22.440 --> 1:54:25.080\n the origins are the dark web and DOD.\n\n1:54:25.080 --> 1:54:28.400\n It was developed so that operatives could communicate\n\n1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:31.360\n with each other without being identified, all right?\n\n1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:33.160\n That then goes open source.\n\n1:54:33.160 --> 1:54:35.200\n They release it, EFF comes in,\n\n1:54:35.200 --> 1:54:38.320\n start sponsoring and everything else like that.\n\n1:54:38.320 --> 1:54:40.160\n The next idea was, well, you know,\n\n1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:42.520\n people can get around their country's firewalls,\n\n1:54:42.520 --> 1:54:44.160\n whistleblowers can use it, things like that.\n\n1:54:44.160 --> 1:54:45.800\n Well, someone forgot to mention\n\n1:54:45.800 --> 1:54:48.000\n that the first adoptees of tech,\n\n1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:50.960\n if you can use it to launder money or remain anonymous,\n\n1:54:50.960 --> 1:54:52.880\n are criminals.\n\n1:54:52.880 --> 1:54:55.320\n And so criminals start to use the damn thing.\n\n1:54:55.320 --> 1:54:56.680\n All right?\n\n1:54:56.680 --> 1:54:59.080\n So along the same time we get,\n\n1:54:59.080 --> 1:55:00.040\n well, a few years later,\n\n1:55:00.040 --> 1:55:02.560\n we get Satoshi Nakamoto pops up\n\n1:55:02.560 --> 1:55:05.240\n with his ideas for Bitcoin,\n\n1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:07.640\n and then Ross Ulbrich runs with it.\n\n1:55:07.640 --> 1:55:10.160\n Ross Ulbrich decides he's gonna start up Silk Road.\n\n1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:13.080\n So initially the people who were using Tor,\n\n1:55:13.080 --> 1:55:15.120\n which later is the dark web,\n\n1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:18.600\n people were using Tor or just talking with each other,\n\n1:55:18.600 --> 1:55:21.560\n visiting websites, communicating like that.\n\n1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:22.400\n Someone figured out,\n\n1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:25.920\n hey man, we could host websites on this thing,\n\n1:55:25.920 --> 1:55:28.960\n and they have a lot of trouble finding the box.\n\n1:55:28.960 --> 1:55:33.680\n So that is the advent of Silk Road all of a sudden.\n\n1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:35.120\n Ross Ulbrich has this idea\n\n1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:36.720\n that he's gonna change the world\n\n1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:40.960\n by becoming the largest drug dealer on the planet.\n\n1:55:40.960 --> 1:55:42.600\n So he opens up the Silk Road\n\n1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:46.520\n and the only payment instrument he allows is Bitcoin.\n\n1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:48.640\n So if those people out there are wondering\n\n1:55:48.640 --> 1:55:51.800\n why Bitcoin is going at what, 44K today?\n\n1:55:51.800 --> 1:55:54.120\n Yeah, and by the time this is out,\n\n1:55:54.120 --> 1:55:56.240\n it could be 100,000 or 10,000.\n\n1:55:56.240 --> 1:55:57.080\n Absolutely.\n\n1:55:57.080 --> 1:55:57.920\n We'll see.\n\n1:55:57.920 --> 1:55:58.760\n Who knows?\n\n1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:01.520\n If it's 10,000, I'm going to buy some.\n\n1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.040\n Which is a hilarious statement to make\n\n1:56:06.040 --> 1:56:09.200\n because that statement would be ridiculously wrong\n\n1:56:09.200 --> 1:56:10.560\n like five years ago, right?\n\n1:56:10.560 --> 1:56:12.680\n I know, I know, I know.\n\n1:56:12.680 --> 1:56:14.560\n People 100 years from now will be laughing,\n\n1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:18.480\n wait, it was that low back then?\n\n1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:20.080\n So he only accepts Bitcoin,\n\n1:56:20.080 --> 1:56:23.960\n and of course the initial use case of crypto\n\n1:56:23.960 --> 1:56:26.600\n is no one wants to admit it today,\n\n1:56:26.600 --> 1:56:29.880\n but the initial use case is we're gonna buy a bunch of pot.\n\n1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:33.600\n We need somebody, we need a way to pay for it.\n\n1:56:33.600 --> 1:56:35.520\n So that's what happens.\n\n1:56:35.520 --> 1:56:38.680\n Ross, it's really interesting to me.\n\n1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:43.240\n If you look at motivations of cyber criminals,\n\n1:56:43.240 --> 1:56:48.040\n the motivations are status, cash, ideology, all right?\n\n1:56:48.040 --> 1:56:51.400\n My guys, all cash, across the board, all cash.\n\n1:56:52.280 --> 1:56:54.640\n Ross is ideology.\n\n1:56:54.640 --> 1:56:57.080\n He really believed he was gonna change the world.\n\n1:56:57.080 --> 1:56:57.920\n He really didn't.\n\n1:56:57.920 --> 1:56:59.280\n I've been fortunate.\n\n1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:03.680\n I actually know the guy who ran Silk Road 2\n\n1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:07.000\n and have talked to the kid, everything else,\n\n1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:10.040\n and I will tell you that those guys\n\n1:57:10.040 --> 1:57:13.040\n who are motivated by ideology,\n\n1:57:13.960 --> 1:57:16.080\n they are a completely different breed.\n\n1:57:16.080 --> 1:57:17.080\n They really are.\n\n1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:21.640\n It's not, you know, the cash guy, it's low hanging fruit.\n\n1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:26.320\n The ease of, it's hard to stop committing crime,\n\n1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:29.400\n but it's much easier for a cash motivated individual\n\n1:57:29.400 --> 1:57:32.520\n to stop than it is that ideology guy.\n\n1:57:32.520 --> 1:57:35.080\n That Silk Road 2 guy, he's still got it.\n\n1:57:35.080 --> 1:57:36.520\n You know, he's not breaking the law,\n\n1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:41.360\n but you can see it's like, he wants to, he wants to.\n\n1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:42.680\n So it's...\n\n1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:45.760\n That's fascinating that, I mean,\n\n1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:47.680\n the worst atrocities in human history\n\n1:57:47.680 --> 1:57:51.160\n are committed with people that operate under ideology.\n\n1:57:51.160 --> 1:57:53.160\n All the other motivations are much weaker.\n\n1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:54.920\n But you know, you think about it,\n\n1:57:54.920 --> 1:57:59.640\n with Ross, I mean, very bright guy, very bright guy,\n\n1:57:59.640 --> 1:58:02.320\n but think about the amount of cognitive dissonance\n\n1:58:02.320 --> 1:58:04.160\n that the guy's got,\n\n1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:06.640\n that he thinks he's gonna change the world\n\n1:58:06.640 --> 1:58:08.320\n by running a drug site.\n\n1:58:09.640 --> 1:58:12.720\n I mean, certainly, I mean, could he have changed the world?\n\n1:58:12.720 --> 1:58:15.880\n Yeah, could he have done it like that?\n\n1:58:15.880 --> 1:58:17.320\n Probably not.\n\n1:58:17.320 --> 1:58:19.480\n Well, I can steel man those arguments.\n\n1:58:19.480 --> 1:58:22.320\n I listened to quite a few libertarians\n\n1:58:22.320 --> 1:58:24.120\n and you can push that to anarchists.\n\n1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:28.880\n You know, there's a lot of people that argue...\n\n1:58:28.880 --> 1:58:32.800\n So I actually talked to a professor at Columbia\n\n1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:35.160\n who actually argues that all drugs should be legalized\n\n1:58:35.160 --> 1:58:37.440\n and not at a philosophical level, political level,\n\n1:58:37.440 --> 1:58:41.320\n but the fact that all the negative consequences of drugs\n\n1:58:41.320 --> 1:58:44.640\n that people talk about actually have to do\n\n1:58:44.640 --> 1:58:47.160\n with other factors in your life.\n\n1:58:47.160 --> 1:58:48.240\n I would agree with that.\n\n1:58:48.240 --> 1:58:51.600\n And so that's, okay, but that's more like a argument\n\n1:58:51.600 --> 1:58:53.640\n about negative aspects of drugs.\n\n1:58:53.640 --> 1:58:56.400\n I think the ideology comes in where it's like,\n\n1:58:56.400 --> 1:58:59.280\n well, nobody should tell you what to do.\n\n1:58:59.280 --> 1:59:02.960\n You should have the responsibility of your own actions.\n\n1:59:02.960 --> 1:59:07.840\n Like the government or any other institution\n\n1:59:07.840 --> 1:59:12.320\n shouldn't be the rule setters,\n\n1:59:12.320 --> 1:59:14.560\n the constraints for how you live your life.\n\n1:59:14.560 --> 1:59:17.160\n And so I could see that argument being made\n\n1:59:17.160 --> 1:59:22.160\n and ultimately if you like create an open market for drugs,\n\n1:59:22.680 --> 1:59:24.600\n how that could build a better society,\n\n1:59:24.600 --> 1:59:28.160\n it might break down the outdated, the corrupt,\n\n1:59:28.160 --> 1:59:29.600\n the bureaucratic institutions.\n\n1:59:29.600 --> 1:59:31.880\n I mean, you can make that argument.\n\n1:59:31.880 --> 1:59:33.640\n There's an argument and let's be fair.\n\n1:59:33.640 --> 1:59:34.560\n I wanna be fair with it.\n\n1:59:34.560 --> 1:59:38.160\n I mean, did he change the world?\n\n1:59:38.160 --> 1:59:40.520\n We do have this whole thing called cryptocurrency.\n\n1:59:40.520 --> 1:59:43.080\n Yeah, in the long arc of history, perhaps.\n\n1:59:43.080 --> 1:59:44.720\n Yeah, we do have that.\n\n1:59:46.040 --> 1:59:46.880\n That's a biggie.\n\n1:59:48.080 --> 1:59:50.720\n And that might've been for it to take hold in society.\n\n1:59:50.720 --> 1:59:52.960\n Maybe the darker parts of society at first,\n\n1:59:52.960 --> 1:59:54.160\n maybe that was necessary.\n\n1:59:54.160 --> 1:59:57.320\n Right, I mean, maybe, we'll see how it pans out.\n\n1:59:57.320 --> 2:00:02.320\n Shadow Crew, we had this guy, Albert Gonzalez,\n\n2:00:02.320 --> 2:00:04.520\n Albert Gonzalez, that's the kid's name.\n\n2:00:04.520 --> 2:00:06.720\n We had, we were growing so big\n\n2:00:06.720 --> 2:00:11.240\n that I had to start farming things out.\n\n2:00:11.240 --> 2:00:12.640\n So the first thing I started farming,\n\n2:00:12.640 --> 2:00:14.760\n I instituted this review system,\n\n2:00:16.320 --> 2:00:18.320\n kind of establishing that trust mechanism\n\n2:00:18.320 --> 2:00:20.040\n even further for criminals to use.\n\n2:00:21.480 --> 2:00:25.040\n We needed somebody to take care of our tech aspects\n\n2:00:25.040 --> 2:00:25.880\n of the forum.\n\n2:00:25.880 --> 2:00:29.560\n So an associate of mine by the name of Kim Taylor,\n\n2:00:29.560 --> 2:00:31.400\n where we're looking for a forum techie,\n\n2:00:31.400 --> 2:00:33.040\n he comes to me one night and he's like,\n\n2:00:33.040 --> 2:00:34.200\n found our forum techie.\n\n2:00:34.200 --> 2:00:35.040\n I was like, who's that?\n\n2:00:35.040 --> 2:00:36.920\n And he's like, it's this kid.\n\n2:00:36.920 --> 2:00:38.400\n And I was like, is he any good?\n\n2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:39.560\n He's like, well, he knows the software.\n\n2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:43.120\n And I was like, okay, we'll just sign his ass on.\n\n2:00:43.120 --> 2:00:45.600\n He went by the screen name of Kumbajonny,\n\n2:00:45.600 --> 2:00:46.800\n was his screen name.\n\n2:00:46.800 --> 2:00:49.800\n And he starts selling credit cards after a while\n\n2:00:49.800 --> 2:00:51.600\n under a screen name of Scarface.\n\n2:00:51.600 --> 2:00:56.600\n And that CB1 breach where you're cashing out\n\n2:00:56.600 --> 2:01:01.600\n the track twos at ATMs, $40,000 a day.\n\n2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:06.840\n So Albert's in New Jersey one day, broad daylight,\n\n2:01:06.840 --> 2:01:11.840\n and stands at an ATM for 40 minutes, just standing there,\n\n2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:16.240\n feeding in one ATM card after another, pulling out cash,\n\n2:01:16.240 --> 2:01:19.600\n taking the 20s out, stuffing them in that backpack.\n\n2:01:19.600 --> 2:01:21.320\n Meanwhile, just across the street,\n\n2:01:21.320 --> 2:01:23.920\n a couple of cops just happened to be there.\n\n2:01:23.920 --> 2:01:28.320\n And they start noticing this kid just standing there.\n\n2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:31.600\n So 40 minutes, they watch this kid, 40 minutes.\n\n2:01:31.600 --> 2:01:33.560\n Finally, one cop looks at the other,\n\n2:01:33.560 --> 2:01:35.280\n let me see what's going on there.\n\n2:01:36.240 --> 2:01:39.240\n Walks over across the street, Albert's wearing a wig.\n\n2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:42.000\n He's got the disguise on, everything else like that.\n\n2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:43.960\n Ask him, kid, what are you doing?\n\n2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:45.280\n Albert falls apart.\n\n2:01:46.480 --> 2:01:48.760\n We didn't know Albert had been arrested.\n\n2:01:48.760 --> 2:01:51.200\n So Albert immediately goes in,\n\n2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:55.040\n I wanna work for the Secret Service.\n\n2:01:55.040 --> 2:01:57.160\n At that point in time, Secret Service,\n\n2:01:59.560 --> 2:02:03.200\n I referred to, and I wanna make sure I don't say,\n\n2:02:03.200 --> 2:02:04.720\n it's not like that anymore.\n\n2:02:04.720 --> 2:02:07.920\n But back then, they were fucking idiots, all right?\n\n2:02:07.920 --> 2:02:09.520\n They had no clue what was going on.\n\n2:02:09.520 --> 2:02:10.960\n So there was a competence issue\n\n2:02:10.960 --> 2:02:12.760\n that they were working through is one way to put it.\n\n2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:15.200\n That's a nice euphemism.\n\n2:02:15.200 --> 2:02:19.000\n So, or fucking idiots is another way to say it.\n\n2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:21.800\n So they're just not aware of the digital world.\n\n2:02:21.800 --> 2:02:23.080\n They had no clue, no clue.\n\n2:02:23.080 --> 2:02:26.160\n The way that Albert tells them how to catch us\n\n2:02:26.160 --> 2:02:28.640\n because they looked at him, how do we catch them?\n\n2:02:28.640 --> 2:02:32.440\n And Albert's like, Albert, I'm serious, I'm serious.\n\n2:02:32.440 --> 2:02:35.680\n So Albert's like, well, you could try a VPN.\n\n2:02:35.680 --> 2:02:37.480\n What's a VPN?\n\n2:02:37.480 --> 2:02:39.840\n So he explains it to them, they're like,\n\n2:02:39.840 --> 2:02:41.800\n that's a good idea.\n\n2:02:41.800 --> 2:02:43.920\n So I quit Shadow Crew.\n\n2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:45.080\n I was worried about all the news\n\n2:02:45.080 --> 2:02:46.200\n that was coming in and everything like that.\n\n2:02:46.200 --> 2:02:47.840\n I'm stealing 160K a week.\n\n2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:49.800\n I didn't know Albert had been arrested.\n\n2:02:51.400 --> 2:02:52.520\n I'm worried about being arrested.\n\n2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:54.520\n I know the writing's on the wall.\n\n2:02:54.520 --> 2:02:56.680\n And I'm like, I'm quitting.\n\n2:02:56.680 --> 2:02:58.400\n Where did you see the writing?\n\n2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:00.400\n The IPs that were coming in,\n\n2:03:00.400 --> 2:03:03.320\n the text messages about the Secret Service investigators\n\n2:03:03.320 --> 2:03:04.160\n I referred to.\n\n2:03:04.160 --> 2:03:05.600\n So the pressure's building.\n\n2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:06.840\n This is not gonna end well.\n\n2:03:06.840 --> 2:03:09.080\n This is going to be bad.\n\n2:03:09.080 --> 2:03:13.560\n So I announced my retirement of February 15th,\n\n2:03:13.560 --> 2:03:18.200\n I'm sorry, April 15th, 2004 is my retirement.\n\n2:03:18.200 --> 2:03:19.920\n I think that's the 2004.\n\n2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:22.720\n And I quit, I walk away.\n\n2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:24.960\n Well, Albert had been arrested.\n\n2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:26.200\n They cut him loose.\n\n2:03:26.200 --> 2:03:27.320\n No one knows he's been arrested.\n\n2:03:27.320 --> 2:03:29.120\n He comes back into Shadow Crew.\n\n2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:31.720\n I leave Kim Taylor at the same time.\n\n2:03:31.720 --> 2:03:34.520\n He's kind of on the run, which if you wanna know that story,\n\n2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:36.880\n that's a nightmare story in and of itself.\n\n2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:40.400\n So my second in charge, Kim Taylor, this guy,\n\n2:03:40.400 --> 2:03:45.200\n there was this guy named David, oh, what was his name?\n\n2:03:46.240 --> 2:03:49.080\n He was, El Mariachi was the guy's name.\n\n2:03:49.080 --> 2:03:50.320\n David Thomas.\n\n2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:52.480\n David, yeah, he was a film guy.\n\n2:03:53.440 --> 2:03:54.920\n Scarface.\n\n2:03:54.920 --> 2:03:58.400\n So El Mariachi, real name David Thomas,\n\n2:03:58.400 --> 2:04:02.320\n he's on the run out of Nebraska for check fraud.\n\n2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:06.280\n He comes to us on Shadow Crew telling us this sad story.\n\n2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:09.000\n We take up a collection for this guy.\n\n2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:10.600\n Send it to him, all right?\n\n2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:13.800\n I get him a job working with a low level carter\n\n2:04:13.800 --> 2:04:16.640\n trying to make him some money, all right?\n\n2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:19.320\n El Mariachi, Thomas does this for a few weeks,\n\n2:04:19.320 --> 2:04:20.480\n comes to me one day and he's like,\n\n2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:22.080\n man, I'm not making any money.\n\n2:04:22.080 --> 2:04:23.440\n I'm like, okay, let me see what I can do.\n\n2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:27.120\n Well, I had a Ukrainian guy by the name of Big Buyer.\n\n2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:29.440\n He, a real friend of mine.\n\n2:04:29.440 --> 2:04:30.920\n And I contacted him, I was like, look, man,\n\n2:04:30.920 --> 2:04:32.160\n I got a guy that wants to do some work.\n\n2:04:32.160 --> 2:04:33.000\n Can you help the guy out?\n\n2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:34.000\n And he's like, I got it.\n\n2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:35.120\n I was like, okay.\n\n2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:38.480\n So he sends Thomas enough money to go,\n\n2:04:38.480 --> 2:04:40.320\n Thomas is in Texas at that point,\n\n2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:43.360\n sends Thomas enough money to go from Texas\n\n2:04:43.360 --> 2:04:47.640\n to Issaquah, Washington and rent an office space, all right?\n\n2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:51.000\n So Thomas goes up there, rents his office space,\n\n2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:54.360\n him and his girlfriend rents an office space.\n\n2:04:54.360 --> 2:04:59.360\n And the plan is, is Big Buyer is going to place an order,\n\n2:04:59.920 --> 2:05:03.320\n get product sent, Mariachi is going to get the product,\n\n2:05:03.320 --> 2:05:07.120\n list it on eBay, cash out 50 50, easy enough, all right?\n\n2:05:07.120 --> 2:05:09.040\n So Big Buyer places an order.\n\n2:05:09.040 --> 2:05:11.960\n First order is outpost.com, $18,000.\n\n2:05:13.320 --> 2:05:16.320\n The largest order outpost.com had ever received\n\n2:05:16.320 --> 2:05:17.440\n at that point in time.\n\n2:05:18.480 --> 2:05:19.760\n Order goes through.\n\n2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:20.640\n It goes through still.\n\n2:05:20.640 --> 2:05:23.640\n Goes through, he gets the product, all right?\n\n2:05:23.640 --> 2:05:25.160\n Mariachi comes back, tells me,\n\n2:05:25.160 --> 2:05:27.080\n tells my second in charge, Kim Taylor.\n\n2:05:27.080 --> 2:05:31.120\n Kim Taylor at this point, I'm 33, 34.\n\n2:05:31.120 --> 2:05:32.520\n Kim Taylor's 46.\n\n2:05:32.520 --> 2:05:35.000\n He works at the Tattered Cover Bookstore\n\n2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:37.840\n in Denver, Colorado is where he works at this point.\n\n2:05:37.840 --> 2:05:40.960\n And he fancies himself Jason Bourne, all right?\n\n2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:43.720\n He's even got one of the screen names of Jason Bourne.\n\n2:05:43.720 --> 2:05:46.400\n So I'm like, all right, so Mariachi is telling us\n\n2:05:46.400 --> 2:05:48.320\n how much money he's making, everything else.\n\n2:05:48.320 --> 2:05:49.160\n I'm like, well, that's good.\n\n2:05:49.160 --> 2:05:50.360\n I'm glad you're all right.\n\n2:05:50.360 --> 2:05:53.400\n Kim contacts me and he's like, I want to go to Issaquah.\n\n2:05:53.400 --> 2:05:54.240\n And I was like, why?\n\n2:05:54.240 --> 2:05:55.520\n And he's like, to make some money.\n\n2:05:55.520 --> 2:05:57.120\n I'm like, you're making money.\n\n2:05:57.120 --> 2:05:58.640\n He's like, I want to go to Issaquah.\n\n2:05:58.640 --> 2:06:00.800\n I was like, all right, go, be careful.\n\n2:06:00.800 --> 2:06:04.560\n So he gets in the car, Saturn is what he's driving.\n\n2:06:04.560 --> 2:06:06.880\n He drives his little piece of Saturn\n\n2:06:06.880 --> 2:06:08.440\n all the way up to Issaquah.\n\n2:06:08.440 --> 2:06:10.680\n Gets there, you know, midnight.\n\n2:06:10.680 --> 2:06:12.520\n They party all night long\n\n2:06:12.520 --> 2:06:14.240\n because they've never met each other.\n\n2:06:14.240 --> 2:06:16.160\n They're just celebrating, partying, drinking,\n\n2:06:16.160 --> 2:06:17.760\n everything else like that.\n\n2:06:17.760 --> 2:06:22.280\n Meanwhile, Big Buyer has placed another order\n\n2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:27.200\n with Outpost.com, $17,000.\n\n2:06:27.200 --> 2:06:31.320\n The second largest order Outpost.com had ever received\n\n2:06:31.320 --> 2:06:33.480\n at that point in time.\n\n2:06:33.480 --> 2:06:35.400\n By this point in time, Outpost knows\n\n2:06:35.400 --> 2:06:37.040\n the first order was fraudulent.\n\n2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:38.200\n Guess where it's going?\n\n2:06:38.200 --> 2:06:41.200\n The exact same address the first order goes.\n\n2:06:41.200 --> 2:06:44.200\n So Outpost picks up the phone, calls Issaquah PD.\n\n2:06:44.200 --> 2:06:46.560\n Hey, we got a fraudster.\n\n2:06:46.560 --> 2:06:51.280\n Issaquah's like, would you mind sending some empty boxes?\n\n2:06:51.280 --> 2:06:54.440\n And Outpost is like, be happy to.\n\n2:06:54.440 --> 2:06:58.280\n So the rule was, is on credit card fraud,\n\n2:06:58.280 --> 2:07:00.600\n if you've got full account access,\n\n2:07:00.600 --> 2:07:01.920\n you place the order.\n\n2:07:01.920 --> 2:07:03.720\n The morning it's supposed to arrive,\n\n2:07:03.720 --> 2:07:06.240\n you sign into the bank account or the credit card account.\n\n2:07:06.240 --> 2:07:09.200\n If you can sign in, you go pick up your product.\n\n2:07:09.200 --> 2:07:12.480\n If you can't sign in, you go back to sleep that day.\n\n2:07:12.480 --> 2:07:13.760\n All right?\n\n2:07:13.760 --> 2:07:16.320\n Well, Big Buyer was the guy who placed the order.\n\n2:07:17.160 --> 2:07:20.400\n Mariachi and my second in charge are partying, all right?\n\n2:07:20.400 --> 2:07:24.320\n So they're supposed to contact Big Buyer, they don't.\n\n2:07:24.320 --> 2:07:26.920\n Meanwhile, Big Buyer is raising hell,\n\n2:07:26.920 --> 2:07:31.200\n getting up with me like, hey, where are the guys?\n\n2:07:31.200 --> 2:07:32.320\n I can't find them.\n\n2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:34.440\n They don't need to pick up this product.\n\n2:07:34.440 --> 2:07:36.360\n So I can't get in touch with them.\n\n2:07:36.360 --> 2:07:37.480\n They go down to pick up the,\n\n2:07:37.480 --> 2:07:41.480\n so Mariachi's got a Cadillac, old 70s Cadillac.\n\n2:07:41.480 --> 2:07:45.640\n He's got a Cadillac, pulls into the complex.\n\n2:07:45.640 --> 2:07:47.520\n Now Mariachi's driving,\n\n2:07:49.040 --> 2:07:50.840\n Kim Taylor's in the passenger seat,\n\n2:07:51.680 --> 2:07:54.200\n David Thomas's girlfriend's in the back seat.\n\n2:07:54.200 --> 2:07:55.880\n As they pull into the complex,\n\n2:07:55.880 --> 2:07:57.600\n going through the parking lot,\n\n2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:00.640\n Mariachi just happens to glance over and he sees a van\n\n2:08:00.640 --> 2:08:03.000\n with a guy sitting sideways in the van.\n\n2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:05.680\n And he looks at Kim Taylor and he's like,\n\n2:08:05.680 --> 2:08:07.840\n that's an undercover.\n\n2:08:07.840 --> 2:08:10.520\n And Kim's like, ah, it's fine.\n\n2:08:10.520 --> 2:08:13.600\n So they pull up to the office complex.\n\n2:08:13.600 --> 2:08:16.720\n Kim's like, I'll go in and get the packages.\n\n2:08:16.720 --> 2:08:19.640\n So he walks in, looks at the guy behind the counter.\n\n2:08:19.640 --> 2:08:21.240\n I believe you have some packages for us.\n\n2:08:21.240 --> 2:08:23.440\n Guy's like, one second.\n\n2:08:23.440 --> 2:08:26.120\n So he disappears around the wall,\n\n2:08:26.120 --> 2:08:29.760\n out pops the Issaquah PD, arrests Kim.\n\n2:08:29.760 --> 2:08:32.480\n David Thomas is in the car watching all this happen.\n\n2:08:32.480 --> 2:08:37.000\n He bugs out and they arrest him on the interstate\n\n2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:40.240\n where he has three fake driver's licenses in his wallet\n\n2:08:40.240 --> 2:08:43.200\n along with his real driver's license, another no, no,\n\n2:08:43.200 --> 2:08:44.200\n but they get him.\n\n2:08:44.200 --> 2:08:48.160\n So David Thomas had outstanding warrants out of Nebraska.\n\n2:08:48.160 --> 2:08:50.160\n We couldn't bond him out.\n\n2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:52.320\n Kim Taylor didn't have any warrants.\n\n2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:53.840\n So we bonded him out.\n\n2:08:53.840 --> 2:08:58.840\n My third in charge, kid, Seth Sanders was his name.\n\n2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:02.640\n He bonds him out, uses his girlfriend's account\n\n2:09:02.640 --> 2:09:03.520\n to bond him out.\n\n2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:08.520\n And I get Kim Taylor to go to Utah\n\n2:09:09.040 --> 2:09:13.560\n where another friend of mine agrees to house him,\n\n2:09:13.560 --> 2:09:15.240\n him and his wife.\n\n2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:17.400\n So I think everything's fine and all that.\n\n2:09:18.720 --> 2:09:21.400\n About three weeks later, this guy in Utah\n\n2:09:21.400 --> 2:09:22.240\n gets me on the phone.\n\n2:09:22.240 --> 2:09:24.400\n I'm like, hey, he's got to go.\n\n2:09:24.400 --> 2:09:27.640\n I'm like, what's going on?\n\n2:09:27.640 --> 2:09:30.560\n He's like, well, the only thing he's doing\n\n2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:33.840\n is popping ecstasy tablets every day, all day.\n\n2:09:33.840 --> 2:09:35.200\n And I'm like, seriously?\n\n2:09:35.200 --> 2:09:36.040\n He's like, yeah.\n\n2:09:36.040 --> 2:09:37.120\n I was like, okay, he's got to go.\n\n2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:38.880\n So we kick him out of there.\n\n2:09:38.880 --> 2:09:40.640\n By this point, I've got another crew that's coming through.\n\n2:09:40.640 --> 2:09:42.440\n I mean, I had all these crews running.\n\n2:09:42.440 --> 2:09:45.380\n Had another crew that's coming through Denver.\n\n2:09:45.380 --> 2:09:49.060\n Send Kim back to Denver to partner up with these guys.\n\n2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:52.080\n Kim gets these guys arrested.\n\n2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:54.800\n So by this point in time, I'm exasperated.\n\n2:09:54.800 --> 2:09:57.960\n I just want to throw my hands up in the air and walk away.\n\n2:09:57.960 --> 2:10:00.720\n So my retirement's coming up at the same time.\n\n2:10:00.720 --> 2:10:03.680\n So I'm like, fuck it, I'm done.\n\n2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:06.120\n So I tell everybody, the rest of the admins\n\n2:10:06.120 --> 2:10:08.000\n and the mods there, I'm like, this is what's going on.\n\n2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:09.480\n You guys need to watch out for this.\n\n2:10:09.480 --> 2:10:11.960\n We need to ban Kim, not let him back in.\n\n2:10:11.960 --> 2:10:13.400\n Be careful what's going on.\n\n2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:15.220\n I walk away.\n\n2:10:15.220 --> 2:10:17.860\n At the same time I walk away,\n\n2:10:17.860 --> 2:10:20.880\n Cumberjani, Albert Gonzalez, comes back into play.\n\n2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:22.560\n He sees everything that's going on.\n\n2:10:22.560 --> 2:10:24.080\n He uses that to his advantage.\n\n2:10:24.080 --> 2:10:26.880\n He starts banning everyone that's suspicious of him,\n\n2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:29.280\n sets up the VPN at the same time and says,\n\n2:10:29.280 --> 2:10:31.560\n hey, to make sure we're all secure,\n\n2:10:31.560 --> 2:10:34.880\n I need all transactions to go through this VPN.\n\n2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:37.560\n VPNs ran by the Secret Service.\n\n2:10:37.560 --> 2:10:39.320\n All right, Secret Service ends up,\n\n2:10:39.320 --> 2:10:41.560\n I think they ended up cataloging like $7 million\n\n2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:45.160\n worth of transactions over the next four or five months.\n\n2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:49.760\n Shadow Crew makes the front cover of Forbes, August, 2004.\n\n2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:51.720\n Headline, Who's Stealing Your Identity.\n\n2:10:52.600 --> 2:10:56.720\n October 26, 2004, United States Secret Service arrest,\n\n2:10:56.720 --> 2:11:00.360\n 33 people, six countries, six hours.\n\n2:11:00.360 --> 2:11:02.860\n I was in Charleston, South Carolina when I saw it happen.\n\n2:11:02.860 --> 2:11:03.700\n And I'm like.\n\n2:11:03.700 --> 2:11:08.480\n So you're the one that got away.\n\n2:11:08.480 --> 2:11:09.320\n I'm the one public.\n\n2:11:09.320 --> 2:11:10.760\n There were a couple other guys that got away\n\n2:11:10.760 --> 2:11:12.480\n that they didn't publicly mention.\n\n2:11:12.480 --> 2:11:14.960\n One, his name was Tron.\n\n2:11:14.960 --> 2:11:17.080\n He was a zero.\n\n2:11:17.080 --> 2:11:18.160\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:21.000\n But he went by the screen name Tron.\n\n2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:25.320\n He had access, almost unfettered access to Bank of America.\n\n2:11:27.240 --> 2:11:29.600\n So what happens is they identified the guy,\n\n2:11:29.600 --> 2:11:31.800\n Secret Service is in the air to go get him.\n\n2:11:31.800 --> 2:11:33.400\n They call the Ukrainian police.\n\n2:11:33.400 --> 2:11:34.840\n Hey, we're coming down to arrest this guy.\n\n2:11:34.840 --> 2:11:38.000\n Ukrainian cops are like, oh, come on down.\n\n2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:39.320\n So as soon as they got off the phone,\n\n2:11:39.320 --> 2:11:42.380\n Ukrainian cops get in the car, go down and tell Tron,\n\n2:11:42.380 --> 2:11:44.520\n hey, they're coming to get you.\n\n2:11:44.520 --> 2:11:45.360\n Yeah.\n\n2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:47.800\n So he bugs out down to South America\n\n2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:50.480\n and they don't catch him I think for six or seven years\n\n2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:51.320\n after that, something like that.\n\n2:11:51.320 --> 2:11:52.680\n But caught him eventually.\n\n2:11:52.680 --> 2:11:53.520\n Caught him eventually.\n\n2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:55.720\n Well, let me actually ask you on this point.\n\n2:11:55.720 --> 2:11:59.680\n You've said that if you do cyber crime eventually,\n\n2:11:59.680 --> 2:12:00.880\n it's not gonna end well.\n\n2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:02.200\n It does not end well.\n\n2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:03.760\n Why is that?\n\n2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:05.440\n So I don't wanna say that's because\n\n2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:07.380\n you're gonna be arrested because honestly,\n\n2:12:07.380 --> 2:12:10.200\n very few people are arrested, all right?\n\n2:12:10.200 --> 2:12:13.720\n But it doesn't end well because of the type of person\n\n2:12:13.720 --> 2:12:14.800\n that you become.\n\n2:12:14.800 --> 2:12:19.800\n You quoted me earlier, you lie to everybody around you.\n\n2:12:21.520 --> 2:12:23.360\n You lie to yourself, you lie to your friends,\n\n2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:24.200\n you lie to your family.\n\n2:12:24.200 --> 2:12:25.760\n Of course, you lie to your victims.\n\n2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:27.800\n You don't have any friends.\n\n2:12:27.800 --> 2:12:30.860\n You know, I went 20 years without friends.\n\n2:12:30.860 --> 2:12:33.520\n I had associates, I didn't have friends.\n\n2:12:33.520 --> 2:12:35.280\n And you can't truly trust anybody.\n\n2:12:35.280 --> 2:12:36.700\n You don't trust anybody.\n\n2:12:36.700 --> 2:12:37.680\n You don't trust anybody.\n\n2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:41.640\n You know, I had my wife, I was married for nine years.\n\n2:12:41.640 --> 2:12:46.200\n I lied to her every single day of those nine years.\n\n2:12:46.200 --> 2:12:49.720\n And it took her nine years to give up on me,\n\n2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:52.500\n to realize that I was that piece of shit.\n\n2:12:52.500 --> 2:12:55.480\n And she leaves at that point.\n\n2:12:55.480 --> 2:12:58.280\n Then from there, I started dating a stripper\n\n2:12:58.280 --> 2:12:59.920\n and lied to her.\n\n2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:00.840\n I thought I had friends.\n\n2:13:00.840 --> 2:13:02.680\n I lied to all those people that I knew\n\n2:13:02.680 --> 2:13:04.720\n that thought they were my friends.\n\n2:13:04.720 --> 2:13:06.940\n I lied to them the entire time.\n\n2:13:06.940 --> 2:13:08.760\n You become that individual.\n\n2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:11.800\n I don't think a lot of people really understand\n\n2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:14.220\n how bad that is.\n\n2:13:14.220 --> 2:13:17.200\n You know, you talked about, you pointed out that woman\n\n2:13:17.200 --> 2:13:18.040\n that I ripped off.\n\n2:13:18.040 --> 2:13:20.080\n She was trying to put a roof on her house\n\n2:13:20.080 --> 2:13:22.000\n for her freaking kids, man.\n\n2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:23.680\n You're that person.\n\n2:13:23.680 --> 2:13:24.880\n You're that person.\n\n2:13:24.880 --> 2:13:27.400\n So you're also lying to yourself.\n\n2:13:29.020 --> 2:13:32.560\n And that's not a mindset in which you can\n\n2:13:34.560 --> 2:13:38.500\n grow as a person, find happiness,\n\n2:13:38.500 --> 2:13:41.080\n find genuine, simple human affection,\n\n2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:42.960\n which is what love is.\n\n2:13:42.960 --> 2:13:46.080\n Simple, real friendship, all of those things.\n\n2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:48.360\n So I went to prison, of course.\n\n2:13:48.360 --> 2:13:50.620\n One of the things, one of the most important lessons\n\n2:13:50.620 --> 2:13:52.600\n that I've learned in prison,\n\n2:13:52.600 --> 2:13:54.480\n because cyber crime as a whole,\n\n2:13:54.480 --> 2:13:56.960\n if you're a criminal, it's an addiction, all right?\n\n2:13:56.960 --> 2:13:57.960\n If you're addicted to something,\n\n2:13:57.960 --> 2:14:00.520\n whether it be drugs, crime, gambling, what have you,\n\n2:14:00.520 --> 2:14:01.760\n if you're addicted to something,\n\n2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:05.880\n you cannot love anything else except the addiction.\n\n2:14:05.880 --> 2:14:08.640\n The addiction comes first, all right?\n\n2:14:08.640 --> 2:14:12.680\n And you pointed out some of those truly despicable things.\n\n2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:16.040\n Script, for example, tortures that guy.\n\n2:14:16.040 --> 2:14:18.000\n You get to the point where it's like,\n\n2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:20.520\n okay, this is the business.\n\n2:14:20.520 --> 2:14:25.380\n And I tried to convince myself that I'm a businessman,\n\n2:14:25.380 --> 2:14:27.120\n but I'm a good guy on the other end.\n\n2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:28.600\n And you're not, you're not.\n\n2:14:28.600 --> 2:14:31.960\n So those lies become part of it, everything else.\n\n2:14:31.960 --> 2:14:36.960\n And yeah, the higher ups are usually arrested, they are.\n\n2:14:37.600 --> 2:14:40.320\n But you've got millions of cyber criminals these days.\n\n2:14:40.320 --> 2:14:43.120\n So most guys are not gonna be arrested.\n\n2:14:43.120 --> 2:14:45.040\n So you may be arrested.\n\n2:14:45.040 --> 2:14:49.520\n You may be like freaking Jonathan James.\n\n2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:53.080\n He was a minor, a very, very talented individual,\n\n2:14:53.080 --> 2:14:54.280\n very competent.\n\n2:14:54.280 --> 2:14:57.600\n He had, as a kid, he had broke into NASA,\n\n2:14:57.600 --> 2:14:59.080\n the OD, Pentagon.\n\n2:14:59.080 --> 2:15:01.520\n He shut the NASA computers down for six weeks.\n\n2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:03.520\n This is that kid.\n\n2:15:03.520 --> 2:15:06.120\n Then he decides he wants to go into credit card theft,\n\n2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:08.520\n partners with Albert, he's arrested with Albert.\n\n2:15:09.640 --> 2:15:13.240\n Law enforcement, they were gonna blame him.\n\n2:15:13.240 --> 2:15:15.980\n He was the only competent individual.\n\n2:15:15.980 --> 2:15:19.280\n So this kid gets up one day, he wasn't in prison yet.\n\n2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:21.200\n He gets up one day, goes in his dad's bedroom,\n\n2:15:21.200 --> 2:15:24.320\n gets out his 45, walks in the bathroom,\n\n2:15:24.320 --> 2:15:26.580\n and blows his brains out.\n\n2:15:26.580 --> 2:15:28.880\n You know, you've got things like that.\n\n2:15:29.980 --> 2:15:31.240\n Or you're gonna rip somebody off,\n\n2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:32.960\n and you're gonna end up like scripted with that guy,\n\n2:15:32.960 --> 2:15:37.280\n the guy who ran Evolution Marketplace.\n\n2:15:37.280 --> 2:15:39.880\n No one knew who, two people ran that guy and a girl.\n\n2:15:40.760 --> 2:15:42.840\n And no one knew who they were.\n\n2:15:42.840 --> 2:15:45.080\n He ends up stealing about $24 million,\n\n2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:46.880\n a lot of it from Ukrainian mob,\n\n2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:48.760\n and they found him about a year later\n\n2:15:48.760 --> 2:15:51.160\n on a beach without his head in hands.\n\n2:15:51.160 --> 2:15:53.360\n But you know, it always goes south.\n\n2:15:53.360 --> 2:15:54.920\n But more than anything, to me,\n\n2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:59.920\n the negative thing is you really become somebody that,\n\n2:16:02.240 --> 2:16:05.720\n I mean, just truly a despicable human being.\n\n2:16:05.720 --> 2:16:09.840\n When you get to the point when you're destroying\n\n2:16:09.840 --> 2:16:11.980\n people's retirement accounts,\n\n2:16:11.980 --> 2:16:13.360\n you're stealing money from a woman\n\n2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:18.220\n that simply wants to do something good for her family.\n\n2:16:18.220 --> 2:16:20.560\n When you become that individual,\n\n2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:23.240\n and you're okay with that, my God, man.\n\n2:16:23.240 --> 2:16:26.360\n It got to the point, I had one guy I ripped off,\n\n2:16:26.360 --> 2:16:27.600\n it's like for $900,\n\n2:16:27.600 --> 2:16:29.920\n is when I first started the cybercrime stuff.\n\n2:16:29.920 --> 2:16:31.980\n It's when I was becoming competent.\n\n2:16:31.980 --> 2:16:35.560\n And I ripped him off for like $900,\n\n2:16:35.560 --> 2:16:40.560\n and he sent me an email, and he was like,\n\n2:16:41.080 --> 2:16:42.620\n the email said something like,\n\n2:16:43.740 --> 2:16:47.680\n I guess you needed the money, and it's okay.\n\n2:16:47.680 --> 2:16:48.880\n You know, you keep it.\n\n2:16:48.880 --> 2:16:52.040\n And I'm getting chills right now thinking about it.\n\n2:16:52.040 --> 2:16:56.980\n It's that, where you become that individual.\n\n2:17:00.160 --> 2:17:01.000\n Yeah.\n\n2:17:02.020 --> 2:17:03.460\n Can I actually backtrack?\n\n2:17:03.460 --> 2:17:06.260\n Listen, I love love, okay?\n\n2:17:06.260 --> 2:17:07.100\n I do too.\n\n2:17:07.100 --> 2:17:11.320\n And there's a story that you fell in love with a stripper.\n\n2:17:11.320 --> 2:17:13.160\n I mean, you have to tell the story.\n\n2:17:13.160 --> 2:17:17.240\n So how did you fall in love with somebody,\n\n2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:19.040\n not that there's anything wrong with that profession,\n\n2:17:19.040 --> 2:17:20.800\n but it's romantic.\n\n2:17:20.800 --> 2:17:23.760\n It's like a true romance, by the way, great movie.\n\n2:17:23.760 --> 2:17:24.960\n It is a great film.\n\n2:17:24.960 --> 2:17:27.000\n It's truly a great film.\n\n2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:31.120\n Even Brad Pitt, who makes a brief appearance, is genius.\n\n2:17:31.120 --> 2:17:32.880\n There's so much good acting there.\n\n2:17:32.880 --> 2:17:35.800\n Anyway, so tell me that love story.\n\n2:17:35.800 --> 2:17:39.580\n All right, so like I said, from my dad,\n\n2:17:39.580 --> 2:17:41.920\n I get that fear of being abandoned.\n\n2:17:41.920 --> 2:17:45.520\n I lied to my wife for nine years until she leaves.\n\n2:17:45.520 --> 2:17:48.100\n And I was in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n2:17:48.100 --> 2:17:51.880\n And what happened was, I noticed that Susan,\n\n2:17:53.120 --> 2:17:56.120\n she was not coming to bed like she used to.\n\n2:17:56.120 --> 2:17:57.500\n She'd stay up all night long,\n\n2:17:57.500 --> 2:18:01.080\n and sometimes she'd go and be gone a few hours\n\n2:18:01.080 --> 2:18:02.160\n and everything else.\n\n2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:03.400\n And I'm like, well, something's going on.\n\n2:18:03.400 --> 2:18:05.520\n And I'd pass by her computer\n\n2:18:05.520 --> 2:18:06.960\n and she would minimize the screens.\n\n2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:08.840\n And I'm like, well, gotta figure out\n\n2:18:08.840 --> 2:18:10.880\n what the hell is going on.\n\n2:18:10.880 --> 2:18:13.400\n So put a key logger on her system.\n\n2:18:13.400 --> 2:18:17.160\n As anybody should in a relationship.\n\n2:18:17.160 --> 2:18:20.880\n Absolutely, because you trust them, so why not?\n\n2:18:20.880 --> 2:18:22.360\n You should be tracking all their movements,\n\n2:18:22.360 --> 2:18:23.200\n all their stuff.\n\n2:18:23.200 --> 2:18:24.240\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n2:18:24.240 --> 2:18:26.040\n Like I said, I was the control freak too.\n\n2:18:26.040 --> 2:18:26.880\n It's romantic.\n\n2:18:26.880 --> 2:18:29.560\n So I found out she'd been cheating on me.\n\n2:18:29.560 --> 2:18:30.400\n And she was.\n\n2:18:30.400 --> 2:18:31.920\n See, there you go, they had a reason.\n\n2:18:31.920 --> 2:18:34.040\n They had a reason, I justified.\n\n2:18:34.040 --> 2:18:35.360\n So I found out she was cheating on me.\n\n2:18:35.360 --> 2:18:36.800\n She was asleep when I found it out.\n\n2:18:36.800 --> 2:18:40.040\n And I sat there looking at it and I was like, well, shit.\n\n2:18:40.040 --> 2:18:42.160\n So I got up, walked in the bedroom,\n\n2:18:42.160 --> 2:18:45.160\n opened up the wardrobe, got a suitcase out,\n\n2:18:45.160 --> 2:18:46.720\n started putting her clothes in it.\n\n2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:48.800\n And she wakes up, she's like, where are you going?\n\n2:18:48.800 --> 2:18:51.360\n And I'm like, I'm not, you are.\n\n2:18:51.360 --> 2:18:54.720\n Well, my bravado disappeared pretty quickly.\n\n2:18:54.720 --> 2:18:58.680\n I took about a week of both of us\n\n2:18:58.680 --> 2:19:01.260\n crying and arguing and everything else.\n\n2:19:01.260 --> 2:19:03.640\n And she finally left.\n\n2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:07.400\n And I went through this depression.\n\n2:19:07.400 --> 2:19:09.400\n I was in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n2:19:09.400 --> 2:19:12.960\n I would just walk around the house kind of stumbling in a daze.\n\n2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:15.240\n Realized I was getting suicidal.\n\n2:19:15.240 --> 2:19:18.440\n And was smart enough to do something about it.\n\n2:19:18.440 --> 2:19:19.840\n And picked up the phone book.\n\n2:19:19.840 --> 2:19:22.320\n And that's where there's always this sense of humor.\n\n2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:23.520\n So I picked up the phone book.\n\n2:19:23.520 --> 2:19:25.020\n I'm going through the yellow pages.\n\n2:19:25.020 --> 2:19:27.220\n I'm like, psychologist, criminal psychologist,\n\n2:19:27.220 --> 2:19:30.280\n because I need that.\n\n2:19:30.280 --> 2:19:32.000\n Called the psychologist, crying to her.\n\n2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:33.040\n I mean, crying on the phone.\n\n2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:33.760\n Told her everything.\n\n2:19:33.760 --> 2:19:34.360\n I'm this criminal.\n\n2:19:34.360 --> 2:19:35.400\n This is what's happened.\n\n2:19:35.400 --> 2:19:36.760\n She's like, come in now.\n\n2:19:36.760 --> 2:19:39.000\n So I go in, spill my guts.\n\n2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:42.240\n And saw her for about four months.\n\n2:19:42.240 --> 2:19:43.960\n And I joke about it, but it's true.\n\n2:19:43.960 --> 2:19:47.440\n She was trying to get me to stop breaking the law\n\n2:19:47.440 --> 2:19:48.840\n and to go into real estate.\n\n2:19:48.840 --> 2:19:51.920\n And I remember telling her, is there a difference?\n\n2:19:51.920 --> 2:19:54.640\n She was like, yes, there's a difference.\n\n2:19:54.640 --> 2:19:57.080\n So I saw her for about four months.\n\n2:19:57.080 --> 2:19:59.160\n I was 34.\n\n2:19:59.160 --> 2:20:02.200\n I didn't start drinking until I was 34.\n\n2:20:02.200 --> 2:20:04.640\n I'd never done drugs or anything else like that,\n\n2:20:04.640 --> 2:20:07.040\n because my mom was an addict as well.\n\n2:20:07.040 --> 2:20:09.680\n So I was this guy that always wanted to be in control.\n\n2:20:09.680 --> 2:20:13.520\n Didn't want to lose control of myself.\n\n2:20:13.520 --> 2:20:16.640\n And had never been to a strip club.\n\n2:20:16.640 --> 2:20:19.520\n So one night, I was getting lonely.\n\n2:20:19.520 --> 2:20:20.760\n So I walked into the strip club.\n\n2:20:20.760 --> 2:20:22.520\n Actually, I was researching the strip club.\n\n2:20:22.520 --> 2:20:27.200\n And it was Joe's Roundup in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n2:20:27.200 --> 2:20:28.520\n Joe's Roundup.\n\n2:20:28.520 --> 2:20:30.720\n Little bitty hole in the wall stuff.\n\n2:20:30.720 --> 2:20:32.280\n Yeah, real classy.\n\n2:20:32.280 --> 2:20:35.080\n So I walked in, and I'm literally\n\n2:20:35.080 --> 2:20:39.920\n that guy, man, that fell in love with the first stripper\n\n2:20:39.920 --> 2:20:41.420\n that he sees.\n\n2:20:41.420 --> 2:20:44.360\n She walks by, I'm like, that one.\n\n2:20:44.360 --> 2:20:46.240\n So I didn't know the strip club game.\n\n2:20:46.240 --> 2:20:48.320\n Again, criminal, naive as hell.\n\n2:20:48.320 --> 2:20:52.480\n So belly up at the bar, order the beer.\n\n2:20:52.480 --> 2:20:54.400\n I'm sitting there drinking it.\n\n2:20:54.400 --> 2:20:57.800\n She comes over to me, and we start talking.\n\n2:20:57.800 --> 2:21:01.000\n And she's like, would you like to get a bottle of champagne?\n\n2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:03.160\n I was like, does that mean going in back or what?\n\n2:21:03.160 --> 2:21:04.860\n She's like, well, yeah, you need to do the bottle\n\n2:21:04.860 --> 2:21:05.360\n when you're going back.\n\n2:21:05.360 --> 2:21:08.040\n And I was like, sure, let's buy a bottle of champagne.\n\n2:21:08.040 --> 2:21:11.160\n $400 bottle of Korbel.\n\n2:21:11.160 --> 2:21:13.360\n So I'm like, all right.\n\n2:21:13.360 --> 2:21:15.440\n And again, that bravado disappears pretty quickly.\n\n2:21:15.440 --> 2:21:18.880\n I get back there, and we talk for two hours.\n\n2:21:18.880 --> 2:21:21.160\n And nowadays, I don't understand that most men\n\n2:21:21.160 --> 2:21:23.280\n who go to strip clubs, the strippers\n\n2:21:23.280 --> 2:21:26.000\n are their therapist most of the time.\n\n2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:27.800\n So I'm sitting there talking, we're talking.\n\n2:21:27.800 --> 2:21:29.640\n And of course, she's sizing me up.\n\n2:21:29.640 --> 2:21:30.760\n She's looking at the watch.\n\n2:21:30.760 --> 2:21:33.800\n She's like, what kind of car do you drive?\n\n2:21:33.800 --> 2:21:34.520\n Everything else.\n\n2:21:34.520 --> 2:21:36.680\n And I'm telling her and talking.\n\n2:21:36.680 --> 2:21:39.200\n So at the end of the night, I'm like, really nice meeting.\n\n2:21:39.200 --> 2:21:41.920\n She's like, it's so nice meeting you, too.\n\n2:21:41.920 --> 2:21:44.200\n So I leave.\n\n2:21:44.200 --> 2:21:45.400\n You guys just talked.\n\n2:21:45.400 --> 2:21:46.000\n Just talked.\n\n2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:48.840\n And there's still this feeling of love and all of that.\n\n2:21:48.840 --> 2:21:49.840\n Yeah, so just talked.\n\n2:21:49.840 --> 2:21:51.160\n Just got along pretty good.\n\n2:21:51.160 --> 2:21:52.920\n I'm like, I like her.\n\n2:21:52.920 --> 2:21:54.320\n I like her.\n\n2:21:54.320 --> 2:21:57.000\n So come back in a week later.\n\n2:21:57.000 --> 2:21:59.440\n Walk in and call her over.\n\n2:21:59.440 --> 2:22:02.720\n And I was like, look, I said, that was my first time\n\n2:22:02.720 --> 2:22:03.320\n to a strip club.\n\n2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:04.400\n I said, don't know you.\n\n2:22:04.400 --> 2:22:04.840\n I like you.\n\n2:22:04.840 --> 2:22:05.900\n I'd like to know you more.\n\n2:22:05.900 --> 2:22:07.880\n Would you like to go out to dinner?\n\n2:22:07.880 --> 2:22:10.160\n And she was like, yeah.\n\n2:22:10.160 --> 2:22:11.960\n I was like, where would you like to go?\n\n2:22:11.960 --> 2:22:13.800\n So she says, Rue de Jon.\n\n2:22:13.800 --> 2:22:15.560\n And I was like, don't know what it is.\n\n2:22:15.560 --> 2:22:16.440\n That's where we'll go.\n\n2:22:16.440 --> 2:22:16.960\n So I go back.\n\n2:22:16.960 --> 2:22:19.520\n And I had a theater buddy at that point in time\n\n2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:23.120\n because I was trying to get my life together.\n\n2:22:23.120 --> 2:22:24.120\n JC was his name.\n\n2:22:24.120 --> 2:22:25.560\n And I was like, I got a date.\n\n2:22:25.560 --> 2:22:26.760\n He's like, you got a date?\n\n2:22:26.760 --> 2:22:28.320\n I was like, yeah, man, I got a date.\n\n2:22:28.320 --> 2:22:30.440\n And he's like, OK, where are you going?\n\n2:22:30.440 --> 2:22:31.480\n I was like, Rue de Jon.\n\n2:22:31.480 --> 2:22:34.520\n And he's like, take your wallet.\n\n2:22:34.520 --> 2:22:35.120\n I'm like, yeah.\n\n2:22:35.120 --> 2:22:37.480\n And he's like, take your wallet.\n\n2:22:37.480 --> 2:22:38.960\n I was like, all right.\n\n2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:43.720\n So we start doing the lunch and the dinner thing.\n\n2:22:43.720 --> 2:22:47.920\n And I get to where I really like her.\n\n2:22:47.920 --> 2:22:48.720\n I was 34.\n\n2:22:48.720 --> 2:22:52.720\n She was 23 and got along really well,\n\n2:22:52.720 --> 2:22:57.520\n had common interest in music and arts and stuff like that.\n\n2:22:57.520 --> 2:22:59.200\n I mean, it's stereotypical.\n\n2:22:59.200 --> 2:23:05.200\n She had graduated college with a degree in religious studies.\n\n2:23:05.200 --> 2:23:06.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:23:06.400 --> 2:23:08.880\n So I was like, all right.\n\n2:23:08.880 --> 2:23:10.600\n So yeah, you just fell in love.\n\n2:23:10.600 --> 2:23:12.640\n We got along really well, really well.\n\n2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:14.640\n So I ended up moving her in with me.\n\n2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:16.480\n She hadn't quit her job.\n\n2:23:16.480 --> 2:23:22.000\n And what was happening was she was working weekends.\n\n2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:26.840\n And the club would close at 3 or 4.\n\n2:23:26.840 --> 2:23:30.280\n She wouldn't come home until 10 or 11 in the morning.\n\n2:23:30.280 --> 2:23:33.280\n And most of the time, it would be a phone call saying,\n\n2:23:33.280 --> 2:23:34.120\n come and pick me up.\n\n2:23:34.120 --> 2:23:35.960\n I can't drive home.\n\n2:23:35.960 --> 2:23:39.680\n And then I'd never used drugs, had never been around.\n\n2:23:39.680 --> 2:23:42.320\n And my mom, Valium and pot and things like that.\n\n2:23:42.320 --> 2:23:43.840\n But as far as interacting with her,\n\n2:23:43.840 --> 2:23:46.080\n I'd never done anything like that.\n\n2:23:46.080 --> 2:23:48.620\n By this point in time, I'm kind of getting head over heels\n\n2:23:48.620 --> 2:23:48.840\n with her.\n\n2:23:48.840 --> 2:23:50.320\n I moved her in with me and everything.\n\n2:23:50.320 --> 2:23:54.740\n And I had never, I was 34, I had never\n\n2:23:54.740 --> 2:23:57.880\n went through a woman's purse in my entire life.\n\n2:23:57.880 --> 2:24:01.880\n And so she comes in, passes out.\n\n2:24:01.880 --> 2:24:04.440\n And I'm like, I got to know what the fuck's going on.\n\n2:24:04.440 --> 2:24:08.960\n And went over and went through her purse.\n\n2:24:08.960 --> 2:24:13.120\n Found cocaine and the straw, cut off straws and all that stuff.\n\n2:24:13.120 --> 2:24:15.480\n And I'm like, broke my heart.\n\n2:24:15.480 --> 2:24:19.320\n I just sat there and started crying.\n\n2:24:19.320 --> 2:24:23.400\n Got online, and I'm the guy that can find information.\n\n2:24:23.400 --> 2:24:26.840\n So I started looking for forums on strip clubs.\n\n2:24:26.840 --> 2:24:30.040\n Found a forum, found that one, found\n\n2:24:30.040 --> 2:24:33.960\n where it was talking about her prostituting herself\n\n2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:35.920\n to support the habit.\n\n2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:40.540\n And that got me, man.\n\n2:24:40.540 --> 2:24:41.040\n That got me.\n\n2:24:41.040 --> 2:24:45.720\n It was talking about everything she was doing to do that.\n\n2:24:45.720 --> 2:24:46.960\n And I broke your heart there.\n\n2:24:46.960 --> 2:24:48.160\n Oh, man.\n\n2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:49.520\n Yeah.\n\n2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:53.680\n So I didn't have the heart to tell her\n\n2:24:53.680 --> 2:24:55.880\n that I knew she was prostituting.\n\n2:24:55.880 --> 2:24:58.000\n But I went to her, and I was like, she's waking up.\n\n2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:01.280\n And I was like, look, I found this in your purse.\n\n2:25:01.280 --> 2:25:02.680\n I can't have that.\n\n2:25:02.680 --> 2:25:04.480\n And she's like, well, you think I'm prostituting?\n\n2:25:04.480 --> 2:25:06.320\n I was like, no, no, I don't think that.\n\n2:25:06.320 --> 2:25:08.760\n I knew it, but I didn't mention it to her.\n\n2:25:08.760 --> 2:25:11.800\n And I was like, I can't have that.\n\n2:25:11.800 --> 2:25:13.120\n Well, I don't do that.\n\n2:25:13.120 --> 2:25:14.240\n It's just a one time thing.\n\n2:25:14.240 --> 2:25:15.560\n I was like, all right.\n\n2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:18.720\n So she went back to work and continued\n\n2:25:18.720 --> 2:25:20.100\n to do it for a couple more weeks.\n\n2:25:20.100 --> 2:25:23.040\n And then finally, I was like, I can't.\n\n2:25:23.040 --> 2:25:25.320\n So I picked her up one morning.\n\n2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:28.760\n She couldn't drive home.\n\n2:25:28.760 --> 2:25:31.000\n Before I picked her up, I had written her a note,\n\n2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:32.860\n left it on the pillow.\n\n2:25:32.860 --> 2:25:35.560\n So I brought her home, tucked her in the bed,\n\n2:25:35.560 --> 2:25:41.560\n and told her I'd be back that night.\n\n2:25:41.560 --> 2:25:43.880\n Told her she had a letter when she woke up.\n\n2:25:43.880 --> 2:25:46.840\n And the letter was basically, I love you.\n\n2:25:46.840 --> 2:25:50.640\n If you can't stop this, don't be here when I get back.\n\n2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:59.680\n And I went to Columbia that day, came back that night,\n\n2:25:59.680 --> 2:26:03.560\n and she had quit her job.\n\n2:26:07.760 --> 2:26:13.640\n And she quit drugs that night, really quit them.\n\n2:26:13.640 --> 2:26:21.960\n And I got it in my head that I needed\n\n2:26:21.960 --> 2:26:26.160\n to do whatever I needed to do to make sure she didn't go back\n\n2:26:26.160 --> 2:26:29.240\n to that.\n\n2:26:29.240 --> 2:26:35.600\n That became, to me, because of my background,\n\n2:26:35.600 --> 2:26:37.640\n that meant spending a lot of money.\n\n2:26:37.640 --> 2:26:42.520\n And so every night was $300 to $600 for dinner.\n\n2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:49.040\n It was $1,000 shoes every week, $2,000 purse every week,\n\n2:26:49.040 --> 2:26:49.520\n all that.\n\n2:26:49.520 --> 2:26:54.840\n I had most of my money laundered out to Estonia.\n\n2:26:54.840 --> 2:27:02.720\n And Elizabeth, at the same time, she quit.\n\n2:27:02.720 --> 2:27:09.480\n But she didn't want me to go anywhere.\n\n2:27:09.480 --> 2:27:12.040\n All right, she wanted me there all the time.\n\n2:27:12.040 --> 2:27:14.280\n I guess that was that connection.\n\n2:27:14.280 --> 2:27:17.720\n I guess she was scared she might go back to something.\n\n2:27:17.720 --> 2:27:21.680\n So Shadow Crew gets busted.\n\n2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:24.920\n I go through, basically, all my US funds.\n\n2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:26.800\n Can't get anything from overseas.\n\n2:27:26.800 --> 2:27:28.480\n Shadow Crew gets busted October.\n\n2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:32.880\n I can't go into committing tax fraud because season's over.\n\n2:27:32.880 --> 2:27:35.120\n Can't go back into credit fraud because Shadow Crew's\n\n2:27:35.120 --> 2:27:35.760\n been busted.\n\n2:27:35.760 --> 2:27:38.160\n I don't know who to trust online.\n\n2:27:38.160 --> 2:27:40.920\n I'm left with running counterfeit cashier's checks\n\n2:27:40.920 --> 2:27:45.080\n to get money in, trying to make it until I can start back\n\n2:27:45.080 --> 2:27:49.240\n with some other fraud, and lying to her the entire time.\n\n2:27:49.240 --> 2:27:50.840\n She knows about none of this.\n\n2:27:50.840 --> 2:27:53.280\n None of it.\n\n2:27:53.280 --> 2:27:55.800\n And she thinks I've got a shitload of money.\n\n2:27:55.800 --> 2:27:59.360\n And she's got expensive taste.\n\n2:27:59.360 --> 2:28:06.640\n So at the same time, she couldn't be intimate.\n\n2:28:06.640 --> 2:28:09.120\n I mean, the girl loved me.\n\n2:28:09.120 --> 2:28:12.880\n That's the first time I've really said that.\n\n2:28:12.880 --> 2:28:15.480\n So there's deep love there both ways.\n\n2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:17.320\n Yeah.\n\n2:28:17.320 --> 2:28:18.800\n Yeah.\n\n2:28:18.800 --> 2:28:21.480\n Things we do.\n\n2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:30.560\n So she couldn't be intimate unless she was stone cold drunk.\n\n2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:31.760\n I mean, just shit.\n\n2:28:31.760 --> 2:28:34.760\n Stone cold drunk.\n\n2:28:34.760 --> 2:28:38.120\n And shit, I didn't mind her drinking alcohol.\n\n2:28:38.120 --> 2:28:40.840\n I'd rather have that than cocaine.\n\n2:28:40.840 --> 2:28:44.600\n So that was the intimacy there.\n\n2:28:44.600 --> 2:28:51.640\n And I kept thinking, if I continue to invest,\n\n2:28:51.640 --> 2:28:57.160\n that it would work out, that just keep going,\n\n2:28:57.160 --> 2:29:00.400\n she'll be all right, we'll be all right.\n\n2:29:03.760 --> 2:29:07.400\n And what happens is, like I said, she thought I had money.\n\n2:29:07.400 --> 2:29:09.560\n She thought I had money.\n\n2:29:09.560 --> 2:29:11.760\n She wanted a couple of Tiffany engagement rings.\n\n2:29:11.760 --> 2:29:13.920\n So I said, we can get married.\n\n2:29:13.920 --> 2:29:17.000\n I figured of marriage, show her that I love her,\n\n2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:18.440\n show her it's going to be all right.\n\n2:29:18.440 --> 2:29:21.280\n So I was like, let's get married.\n\n2:29:21.280 --> 2:29:23.600\n She's like, well, I've always wanted a Tiffany ring.\n\n2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:25.400\n She doesn't have money to buy the Tiffany ring\n\n2:29:25.400 --> 2:29:26.840\n because all my money was overseas.\n\n2:29:26.840 --> 2:29:27.600\n So here I am.\n\n2:29:27.600 --> 2:29:29.400\n I defraud.\n\n2:29:29.400 --> 2:29:31.200\n So it's counterfeit cashiers.\n\n2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:36.680\n I find like a three carat ring on eBay for 20 grand\n\n2:29:36.680 --> 2:29:40.560\n and pay for it with a counterfeit cashiers check.\n\n2:29:40.560 --> 2:29:43.960\n At the same time, because she doesn't want me to leave,\n\n2:29:43.960 --> 2:29:46.400\n she needs me there, typically, if you're\n\n2:29:46.400 --> 2:29:49.440\n doing that type of crime, you need to be traveling.\n\n2:29:49.440 --> 2:29:51.560\n You can't do it in one central area\n\n2:29:51.560 --> 2:29:53.960\n because you're going to be identified pretty quickly.\n\n2:29:53.960 --> 2:29:57.160\n I knew that, but I didn't have much choice.\n\n2:29:57.160 --> 2:30:00.480\n So start running counterfeit cashiers checks\n\n2:30:00.480 --> 2:30:03.600\n to get the money to live and everything.\n\n2:30:03.600 --> 2:30:06.800\n Get the engagement ring.\n\n2:30:06.800 --> 2:30:13.360\n We were scheduled to be married. Our wedding date\n\n2:30:13.360 --> 2:30:19.080\n was February 26, 2005.\n\n2:30:19.080 --> 2:30:23.000\n February 8, 2005.\n\n2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:28.160\n I've got a Tiffany wedding band, a couple of them coming in.\n\n2:30:28.160 --> 2:30:32.040\n And I get arrested in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n2:30:32.040 --> 2:30:34.360\n And she didn't know.\n\n2:30:34.360 --> 2:30:36.720\n I told her, I said, I've got to go pick up those rings.\n\n2:30:36.720 --> 2:30:39.080\n She thought I was just having them sent in.\n\n2:30:39.080 --> 2:30:40.680\n I said, I've got to go get those rings.\n\n2:30:40.680 --> 2:30:43.240\n And I said, we'll go out to dinner after that.\n\n2:30:43.240 --> 2:30:49.160\n And I left at like 8 o clock in the morning.\n\n2:30:49.160 --> 2:30:54.680\n And I was arrested at, I think, 1130, something like that.\n\n2:30:54.680 --> 2:30:56.560\n Of course, I wanted to call her.\n\n2:30:56.560 --> 2:30:58.760\n And the FBI got me.\n\n2:30:58.760 --> 2:31:00.560\n It turns out it was controlled delivery.\n\n2:31:00.560 --> 2:31:03.200\n There were like 30 agents in the parking lot.\n\n2:31:03.200 --> 2:31:04.040\n FBI got me.\n\n2:31:04.040 --> 2:31:05.640\n Charleston PD got me.\n\n2:31:05.640 --> 2:31:07.560\n Within 45 minutes, the Secret Service\n\n2:31:07.560 --> 2:31:09.800\n comes in, takes over that investigation.\n\n2:31:09.800 --> 2:31:13.280\n They knew exactly who they had.\n\n2:31:13.280 --> 2:31:16.720\n Along about 7 o clock at night, they're\n\n2:31:16.720 --> 2:31:18.600\n like, we want to search your house.\n\n2:31:18.600 --> 2:31:21.040\n And I was like, look, I'll sign off on the search\n\n2:31:21.040 --> 2:31:23.760\n if you let me go with you so I can see her.\n\n2:31:23.760 --> 2:31:27.240\n And they were like, OK.\n\n2:31:27.240 --> 2:31:28.880\n So I got to see my phone at that point.\n\n2:31:28.880 --> 2:31:32.880\n I had like 140 calls where she had\n\n2:31:32.880 --> 2:31:34.480\n been trying to call all that time.\n\n2:31:34.480 --> 2:31:35.440\n She was worried.\n\n2:31:35.440 --> 2:31:36.640\n Yeah.\n\n2:31:36.640 --> 2:31:40.000\n And so they load me up.\n\n2:31:40.000 --> 2:31:45.520\n And hell, I mean, you talk about 10, 12 cars, 40 agents,\n\n2:31:45.520 --> 2:31:46.520\n everything else.\n\n2:31:46.520 --> 2:31:47.880\n She's got a dog at that point.\n\n2:31:47.880 --> 2:31:49.640\n I'm scared they're going to shoot the dog.\n\n2:31:49.640 --> 2:31:55.920\n And it was dark.\n\n2:31:55.920 --> 2:31:57.160\n And they had me walk up.\n\n2:31:57.160 --> 2:31:58.840\n And they're all behind me.\n\n2:31:58.840 --> 2:32:01.640\n I knock on the door and tell her the police are there.\n\n2:32:01.640 --> 2:32:03.840\n She needs to put the dog up.\n\n2:32:03.840 --> 2:32:06.800\n So she does, and they come in and just\n\n2:32:06.800 --> 2:32:09.600\n start ransacking them to put me in cuffs, set me down,\n\n2:32:09.600 --> 2:32:11.360\n start berating her with questions.\n\n2:32:11.360 --> 2:32:13.720\n She had no idea what the hell was going on.\n\n2:32:13.720 --> 2:32:16.800\n Were you able to say a word or two to help her understand?\n\n2:32:16.800 --> 2:32:18.160\n Yeah, I was trying to tell her.\n\n2:32:18.160 --> 2:32:21.520\n And at the same time, they take a watch off her wrist.\n\n2:32:21.520 --> 2:32:24.080\n They let her keep the ring.\n\n2:32:24.080 --> 2:32:25.880\n They're telling her that I'm this guy.\n\n2:32:25.880 --> 2:32:27.360\n What's my real name?\n\n2:32:27.360 --> 2:32:29.480\n Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang across the board.\n\n2:32:29.480 --> 2:32:31.000\n So she's probably terrified.\n\n2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:31.720\n Oh, yeah.\n\n2:32:31.720 --> 2:32:32.600\n Yeah.\n\n2:32:32.600 --> 2:32:33.320\n Yeah.\n\n2:32:33.320 --> 2:32:34.920\n And I tell her, I was like, look,\n\n2:32:34.920 --> 2:32:36.320\n they're going to arraign me tomorrow.\n\n2:32:36.320 --> 2:32:37.440\n Don't come.\n\n2:32:37.440 --> 2:32:38.480\n Don't come.\n\n2:32:38.480 --> 2:32:42.000\n I said, see what's going on, but don't show up.\n\n2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:43.560\n Of course, she's there next morning.\n\n2:32:43.560 --> 2:32:45.240\n Her and her dad.\n\n2:32:45.240 --> 2:32:47.720\n And she's back in the back crying.\n\n2:32:47.720 --> 2:32:49.520\n They're reading off the charges.\n\n2:32:49.520 --> 2:32:55.520\n I'm under $300,000 bond, everything else.\n\n2:32:55.520 --> 2:32:59.320\n And that's it.\n\n2:32:59.320 --> 2:33:01.040\n They throw me in a cell.\n\n2:33:01.040 --> 2:33:04.560\n Meanwhile, more charges keep coming in.\n\n2:33:04.560 --> 2:33:10.280\n And it's like 10, 12 charges a day at that point.\n\n2:33:10.280 --> 2:33:13.560\n And I'm trying to call her to make sure she's all right.\n\n2:33:13.560 --> 2:33:16.600\n And does it get through?\n\n2:33:16.600 --> 2:33:19.000\n So I spent three months in jail.\n\n2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:21.520\n And during that three months, she visits twice.\n\n2:33:21.520 --> 2:33:23.360\n I get like three or four phone calls to her.\n\n2:33:26.160 --> 2:33:28.000\n Looking back now, I understand why.\n\n2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:29.720\n Back then, it was like, I'm the victim.\n\n2:33:29.720 --> 2:33:31.160\n Why doesn't she talk to me?\n\n2:33:31.160 --> 2:33:35.160\n But now I understand why.\n\n2:33:35.160 --> 2:33:37.240\n Hell, the girl loved me too.\n\n2:33:37.240 --> 2:33:39.000\n She found out I was this piece of shit.\n\n2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:44.040\n And after a week in county jail, two agents\n\n2:33:44.040 --> 2:33:47.160\n fly in from New Jersey, two Secret Service guys.\n\n2:33:47.160 --> 2:33:50.520\n Pulled me out of cell, looked at me, and they were like,\n\n2:33:50.520 --> 2:33:51.400\n we've got your laptop.\n\n2:33:51.400 --> 2:33:52.440\n And I was like, yeah.\n\n2:33:52.440 --> 2:33:55.200\n And he's like, well, have you got anything on your laptop?\n\n2:33:55.200 --> 2:33:56.160\n And I was like, yeah.\n\n2:33:56.160 --> 2:33:57.560\n He's like, you're going to be charged for it.\n\n2:33:57.560 --> 2:33:59.280\n I was like, I figured.\n\n2:33:59.280 --> 2:34:01.760\n And then he looks at me, he's like,\n\n2:34:01.760 --> 2:34:05.280\n can you do anything for us?\n\n2:34:05.280 --> 2:34:07.240\n And I told him my exact words were, look,\n\n2:34:07.240 --> 2:34:08.720\n you let me get back with Elizabeth.\n\n2:34:08.720 --> 2:34:11.240\n I'll do whatever you want me to do.\n\n2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:14.160\n And he looks at me, he's like, we're going to get you out.\n\n2:34:14.160 --> 2:34:15.200\n I was like, all right.\n\n2:34:15.200 --> 2:34:17.920\n So they let me sit there for three months\n\n2:34:17.920 --> 2:34:21.960\n to get a taste of it and get me out.\n\n2:34:21.960 --> 2:34:25.260\n My sister, they have the bond reduced to $1,000.\n\n2:34:25.260 --> 2:34:27.200\n My sister pays the $1,000 bond.\n\n2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:28.920\n By this point, she's disowned me.\n\n2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:31.880\n And because I'm dating the stripper.\n\n2:34:31.880 --> 2:34:36.000\n And Denise bonds me out.\n\n2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:40.280\n The person that I call immediately is Elizabeth.\n\n2:34:40.280 --> 2:34:41.240\n I'm out.\n\n2:34:41.240 --> 2:34:43.480\n And she's like, I'll be there.\n\n2:34:43.480 --> 2:34:44.680\n I was like, OK.\n\n2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:49.120\n So it's like 11 o clock at night.\n\n2:34:49.120 --> 2:34:53.520\n I'm in the parking lot of the Charleston County jail.\n\n2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:55.960\n Me and a Secret Service agent standing there.\n\n2:34:55.960 --> 2:34:58.800\n And Elizabeth had a friend that owned a limo company.\n\n2:34:58.800 --> 2:35:04.640\n So she pulls up in a limo, gets out, pops the trunk,\n\n2:35:04.640 --> 2:35:06.960\n gets these two plastic containers out\n\n2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:12.560\n that have my clothes in them, drops them off the pavement,\n\n2:35:12.560 --> 2:35:16.320\n comes over, hugs me, call me later.\n\n2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:18.480\n Gets in the car, drives off.\n\n2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:20.800\n I'm sitting there crying like a baby.\n\n2:35:20.800 --> 2:35:23.260\n Agent looks at me, is that your fiancee?\n\n2:35:23.260 --> 2:35:23.880\n I'm like, yeah.\n\n2:35:23.880 --> 2:35:25.520\n And he's like, I am so sorry.\n\n2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:28.320\n And I'm like, yeah.\n\n2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:30.040\n I had to.\n\n2:35:30.040 --> 2:35:32.360\n She sounds fascinating.\n\n2:35:32.360 --> 2:35:33.200\n Pull up in a limo.\n\n2:35:36.720 --> 2:35:40.200\n I had $30 in my name at that point, $30.\n\n2:35:40.200 --> 2:35:43.920\n The agent had to pay for my hotel room that first night.\n\n2:35:43.920 --> 2:35:45.840\n So he drops me off after paying for the hotel room,\n\n2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:47.320\n buy me something to eat.\n\n2:35:47.320 --> 2:35:50.280\n Soon as he drops me off, I take that $30,\n\n2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:53.880\n walk a half mile to Walmart, buy a prepaid debit card\n\n2:35:53.880 --> 2:35:56.080\n so I can start back in tax fraud.\n\n2:35:56.080 --> 2:35:58.320\n Soon as I get back to the hotel room, call Elizabeth,\n\n2:35:58.320 --> 2:36:00.480\n beg her to come see me.\n\n2:36:00.480 --> 2:36:03.320\n She comes to see me, and we talk most of the night,\n\n2:36:03.320 --> 2:36:05.580\n and convince her to give me a chance.\n\n2:36:05.580 --> 2:36:07.920\n I tell her that everything's going to be all right.\n\n2:36:07.920 --> 2:36:09.000\n They're going to hire me.\n\n2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:11.080\n I'm going to be this big consultant.\n\n2:36:11.080 --> 2:36:14.320\n Lies, lies, just so she'd get back with me.\n\n2:36:14.320 --> 2:36:16.720\n And she's like, OK.\n\n2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:20.600\n And so we move from Charleston.\n\n2:36:20.600 --> 2:36:24.800\n The field office is in Columbia, South Carolina.\n\n2:36:24.800 --> 2:36:27.800\n And I'm breaking the law.\n\n2:36:27.800 --> 2:36:30.460\n Even before I start working with them, I'm breaking the law.\n\n2:36:30.460 --> 2:36:34.680\n And so they've got me in the office, the field office.\n\n2:36:34.680 --> 2:36:36.400\n They got this big war room in there.\n\n2:36:36.400 --> 2:36:39.840\n I'm on a laptop, outside line, laptops hooked up\n\n2:36:39.840 --> 2:36:43.240\n to a 50 inch plasma monitor on the wall.\n\n2:36:43.240 --> 2:36:47.000\n They've got a desktop sitting directly next to me,\n\n2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:50.640\n outside line, two Secret Service officers in the room\n\n2:36:50.640 --> 2:36:54.960\n at all times with a South Carolina law enforcement officer.\n\n2:36:54.960 --> 2:36:59.320\n My job is 46 hours a day, surfing the web,\n\n2:36:59.320 --> 2:37:01.640\n picking up targets, intel, teaching them\n\n2:37:01.640 --> 2:37:04.800\n how cybercrime operates, everything else like that.\n\n2:37:04.800 --> 2:37:08.840\n For the first two weeks, they are extremely diligent.\n\n2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:10.840\n They pay attention to everything that's going on,\n\n2:37:10.840 --> 2:37:12.140\n ask questions, everything else.\n\n2:37:12.140 --> 2:37:17.280\n But the problem is that that shit gets boring real quick,\n\n2:37:17.280 --> 2:37:20.440\n because I'm very fast online doing that.\n\n2:37:20.440 --> 2:37:22.600\n So they're like, what the hell is he doing?\n\n2:37:22.600 --> 2:37:25.520\n And it gets tiring looking at a guy just doing that shit.\n\n2:37:25.520 --> 2:37:28.960\n So after two weeks, they get lazy and bored.\n\n2:37:28.960 --> 2:37:34.760\n And they start watching porn instead of watching me.\n\n2:37:34.760 --> 2:37:37.240\n At the same time, they've got a keylogger.\n\n2:37:37.240 --> 2:37:39.680\n And they've got Spectre Pro and Camtasia,\n\n2:37:39.680 --> 2:37:43.840\n keyloggers and taking snapshots of everything that I'm doing.\n\n2:37:43.840 --> 2:37:46.960\n Every night, it goes on a DVD rom on a spindle.\n\n2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:51.840\n So I'm like, they're not going to go through that shit.\n\n2:37:51.840 --> 2:37:53.600\n So I'm like, fuck it.\n\n2:37:53.600 --> 2:37:55.840\n Start breaking the law from inside the Secret Service\n\n2:37:55.840 --> 2:37:57.640\n offices while they're in the room.\n\n2:37:57.640 --> 2:37:58.140\n Why not?\n\n2:38:00.920 --> 2:38:03.800\n That continues for 10 months.\n\n2:38:03.800 --> 2:38:06.880\n At the same time, the relationship with Elizabeth\n\n2:38:06.880 --> 2:38:09.080\n fell apart, completely fell apart.\n\n2:38:12.440 --> 2:38:14.680\n Do you have an understanding of why?\n\n2:38:14.680 --> 2:38:18.320\n Because her heart got broken because there was lying.\n\n2:38:18.320 --> 2:38:19.120\n It was the trust.\n\n2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:23.360\n She felt like she did a lot to sacrifice for the relationship.\n\n2:38:23.360 --> 2:38:33.080\n You've got a woman there that she had even said it.\n\n2:38:33.080 --> 2:38:38.560\n She was like, she had told one of her friends\n\n2:38:38.560 --> 2:38:41.360\n we were out having dinner one night.\n\n2:38:41.360 --> 2:38:42.840\n And this was before I got arrested.\n\n2:38:42.840 --> 2:38:47.320\n She told one of her friends that I was the only guy that ever\n\n2:38:47.320 --> 2:38:49.800\n asked her to stop using drugs.\n\n2:38:49.800 --> 2:38:51.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:38:51.080 --> 2:38:52.120\n Yeah.\n\n2:38:52.120 --> 2:38:57.920\n Yeah, I have to say that part of the story is so powerful.\n\n2:38:57.920 --> 2:39:03.920\n And then that she chose to do it, and she chose to stop.\n\n2:39:03.920 --> 2:39:07.880\n And she told me that there was one instance she told me\n\n2:39:07.880 --> 2:39:10.880\n that if she didn't marry me, she'd never be married.\n\n2:39:10.880 --> 2:39:15.800\n And as far as I know, she's never been married.\n\n2:39:15.800 --> 2:39:17.800\n And so it started to fall apart there.\n\n2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:23.640\n Yeah, because I was that piece of shit.\n\n2:39:23.640 --> 2:39:25.520\n Still, you didn't take a step.\n\n2:39:25.520 --> 2:39:29.600\n By the way, can I just say how just moving it is,\n\n2:39:29.600 --> 2:39:30.440\n how honest you are.\n\n2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:32.080\n But thank you.\n\n2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:34.600\n Thank you for being that person.\n\n2:39:34.600 --> 2:39:38.440\n But at that time, there's still that lying.\n\n2:39:38.440 --> 2:39:39.320\n Oh, man, yeah.\n\n2:39:39.320 --> 2:39:39.960\n Yeah.\n\n2:39:39.960 --> 2:39:40.640\n Yeah.\n\n2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:44.680\n So it's falling apart.\n\n2:39:44.680 --> 2:39:46.640\n She wants to start going to strip clubs.\n\n2:39:46.640 --> 2:39:49.280\n And I'm like, fuck it.\n\n2:39:49.280 --> 2:39:50.120\n Why not?\n\n2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:51.560\n We'll go.\n\n2:39:51.560 --> 2:39:52.880\n So we start going to strip clubs,\n\n2:39:52.880 --> 2:39:55.200\n and she'll come back and get wasted.\n\n2:39:55.200 --> 2:39:58.000\n And we'll have sex, what have you.\n\n2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:07.840\n And one night, she looks at me, and she was like,\n\n2:40:07.840 --> 2:40:10.360\n I think it'd be funny if you got a blow job\n\n2:40:10.360 --> 2:40:12.760\n from somebody else.\n\n2:40:12.760 --> 2:40:15.960\n And that got me.\n\n2:40:15.960 --> 2:40:16.520\n That got me.\n\n2:40:16.520 --> 2:40:20.720\n I was like, to me, that was the final straw right there.\n\n2:40:20.720 --> 2:40:23.800\n I was like, she doesn't care for me anymore or anything else\n\n2:40:23.800 --> 2:40:25.480\n like that.\n\n2:40:25.480 --> 2:40:27.600\n We've been going to strip clubs, so I\n\n2:40:27.600 --> 2:40:29.160\n started dating another stripper.\n\n2:40:29.160 --> 2:40:33.760\n And she knew something was going on.\n\n2:40:33.760 --> 2:40:37.080\n And she looks at me one day, and she's like,\n\n2:40:37.080 --> 2:40:39.040\n why don't you just tell me that it's over?\n\n2:40:39.040 --> 2:40:41.080\n And I looked at her, and I said, it's over.\n\n2:40:41.080 --> 2:40:42.160\n We're done.\n\n2:40:42.160 --> 2:40:48.360\n And I told her, I was like, look, I said, whatever you want.\n\n2:40:48.360 --> 2:40:49.560\n We were renting an apartment.\n\n2:40:49.560 --> 2:40:53.000\n I was like, whatever you want in here, take it.\n\n2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:58.400\n And I said, not only that, but I'll\n\n2:40:58.400 --> 2:41:02.840\n make sure you got money for several months\n\n2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:04.160\n so you're all right.\n\n2:41:04.160 --> 2:41:07.280\n And I was like, just leave me my TV\n\n2:41:07.280 --> 2:41:11.680\n and leave me some plates and stuff.\n\n2:41:11.680 --> 2:41:15.000\n So I go to work that day at the Secret Service,\n\n2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:19.320\n come back that night, and she's taken everything\n\n2:41:19.320 --> 2:41:22.800\n and left a picture of herself in the bedroom on the floor.\n\n2:41:22.800 --> 2:41:26.960\n I'm like, OK, I guess I deserve that.\n\n2:41:26.960 --> 2:41:28.680\n She's got, I like her.\n\n2:41:28.680 --> 2:41:29.880\n She's got a sense of humor.\n\n2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:30.840\n Yeah, she was cool.\n\n2:41:30.840 --> 2:41:33.240\n She was cool.\n\n2:41:33.240 --> 2:41:36.600\n I'm giving her $1,000 every two weeks\n\n2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:37.640\n or some shit like that.\n\n2:41:37.640 --> 2:41:40.400\n And it gets to the point, because I'm\n\n2:41:40.400 --> 2:41:43.520\n doing this tax fraud from inside the offices.\n\n2:41:43.520 --> 2:41:47.640\n Well, the debit card companies are pinging the cards.\n\n2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:49.720\n They start to realize that, hey, some son of a bitch\n\n2:41:49.720 --> 2:41:51.840\n is stealing money using our debit card.\n\n2:41:51.840 --> 2:41:53.280\n So they start to shut down the cards\n\n2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:54.920\n before I can pull cash out.\n\n2:41:54.920 --> 2:41:57.320\n So I start not to have the money to send to her.\n\n2:41:57.320 --> 2:42:01.400\n And I'm like, so she calls, and she's like, look,\n\n2:42:01.400 --> 2:42:02.920\n I have to have money.\n\n2:42:02.920 --> 2:42:05.800\n And I was like, well, look, I'm doing what I can.\n\n2:42:05.800 --> 2:42:06.760\n You promised money.\n\n2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:08.120\n And I was like, look, if you knew\n\n2:42:08.120 --> 2:42:10.000\n what I was doing to get this money,\n\n2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:11.600\n you wouldn't be asking that.\n\n2:42:11.600 --> 2:42:13.960\n And she's like, I need money.\n\n2:42:13.960 --> 2:42:16.560\n My rent's behind by a month right now.\n\n2:42:16.560 --> 2:42:18.040\n And I'm like, your rent's behind?\n\n2:42:18.040 --> 2:42:18.760\n She's like, yeah.\n\n2:42:18.760 --> 2:42:21.760\n So I was like, OK, so I pick up the phone,\n\n2:42:21.760 --> 2:42:23.360\n call the rental office.\n\n2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:27.360\n And I was like, I just want to make sure that I'm sorry\n\n2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:29.720\n I'm behind on the rent for this apartment number.\n\n2:42:29.720 --> 2:42:33.440\n Oh, no, that rent's paid up three months.\n\n2:42:33.440 --> 2:42:35.720\n It's like, OK, hang up, call Elizabeth back.\n\n2:42:35.720 --> 2:42:38.040\n I was like, you're behind on the rent.\n\n2:42:38.040 --> 2:42:39.440\n And she was like, yeah.\n\n2:42:39.440 --> 2:42:42.280\n And I was like, funny, they just said\n\n2:42:42.280 --> 2:42:43.440\n you're up on it three months.\n\n2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:47.480\n And she gets quiet, and she's like, well, you lied to me, too.\n\n2:42:47.480 --> 2:42:50.520\n And I was like, you're right.\n\n2:42:50.520 --> 2:42:51.200\n I did.\n\n2:42:51.200 --> 2:42:52.440\n I did that.\n\n2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:54.640\n I was like, but look, I can't do it anymore.\n\n2:42:54.640 --> 2:43:00.320\n And that's the last time I spoke to her right there.\n\n2:43:00.320 --> 2:43:05.960\n What happens is I was breaking law\n\n2:43:05.960 --> 2:43:07.440\n from inside the offices.\n\n2:43:07.440 --> 2:43:12.560\n I had a buddy that his name was Sean Mims out of Los Angeles.\n\n2:43:12.560 --> 2:43:16.480\n I had taught him how to do tax return fraud.\n\n2:43:16.480 --> 2:43:19.320\n I had told Sean, I go missing, I go missing for three months.\n\n2:43:19.320 --> 2:43:22.280\n I told him if I ever went missing not to contact me.\n\n2:43:22.280 --> 2:43:26.760\n And so I go missing, then I show back up online.\n\n2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:28.360\n First day, he contacts.\n\n2:43:28.360 --> 2:43:29.880\n So he becomes a target.\n\n2:43:29.880 --> 2:43:33.200\n And they identify him pretty quickly at that point.\n\n2:43:33.200 --> 2:43:38.560\n He's set to be arrested sometime in March of six.\n\n2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:40.880\n That's when he's set to be arrested.\n\n2:43:40.880 --> 2:43:43.160\n Operation Rolling Stone was the name of the operation.\n\n2:43:43.160 --> 2:43:45.800\n Nine people were supposed to be arrested that night.\n\n2:43:45.800 --> 2:43:50.120\n So Secret Service goes and arrests this guy.\n\n2:43:50.120 --> 2:43:53.720\n They search his apartment and don't find anything.\n\n2:43:53.720 --> 2:43:56.400\n The apartment manager comes out and explains to him\n\n2:43:56.400 --> 2:43:58.440\n how Sean has done all kinds of work to the apartment.\n\n2:43:58.440 --> 2:44:03.480\n As a matter of fact, he brought in $30,000 worth of Italian tile\n\n2:44:03.480 --> 2:44:06.000\n to put in the apartment that he's renting.\n\n2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:09.440\n And by the way, last night he had a UHaul out here\n\n2:44:09.440 --> 2:44:11.760\n and took out a whole shitload of stuff.\n\n2:44:11.760 --> 2:44:15.640\n So Secret Service comes back in.\n\n2:44:15.640 --> 2:44:17.040\n They look at me and they're like, we\n\n2:44:17.040 --> 2:44:19.440\n need you to take a polygraph.\n\n2:44:19.440 --> 2:44:22.880\n And my answer was, I ain't taking a polygraph.\n\n2:44:22.880 --> 2:44:25.000\n So they're like, well, we'll throw you back in jail\n\n2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:25.400\n if you don't.\n\n2:44:25.400 --> 2:44:26.640\n And I was like, call my lawyer.\n\n2:44:26.640 --> 2:44:27.880\n Lawyer gets me on the phone.\n\n2:44:27.880 --> 2:44:30.400\n He's like, you don't have to take the polygraph.\n\n2:44:30.400 --> 2:44:32.200\n I was like, well, good, I'm not going to.\n\n2:44:32.200 --> 2:44:33.920\n But they will throw you back in jail.\n\n2:44:33.920 --> 2:44:35.840\n And I was like, don't want to do that.\n\n2:44:35.840 --> 2:44:39.000\n And he's like, have you done anything?\n\n2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:41.160\n And I was like, yeah.\n\n2:44:41.160 --> 2:44:46.640\n And he's like, well, you can try to pass the polygraph.\n\n2:44:46.640 --> 2:44:48.080\n I'm like, OK.\n\n2:44:48.080 --> 2:44:49.040\n So I slipped out.\n\n2:44:49.040 --> 2:44:51.200\n I was like, let's take the polygraph.\n\n2:44:51.200 --> 2:44:52.360\n They asked three questions.\n\n2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:56.360\n The questions were, have you talked to anybody?\n\n2:44:56.360 --> 2:44:58.920\n Have you been on a computer outside of the offices?\n\n2:44:58.920 --> 2:45:00.600\n Have you talked to the press, which\n\n2:45:00.600 --> 2:45:02.280\n I was interviewing with a New York Times\n\n2:45:02.280 --> 2:45:03.720\n writer the entire time?\n\n2:45:03.720 --> 2:45:05.880\n And then have you contacted or warned anybody\n\n2:45:05.880 --> 2:45:07.080\n about investigations?\n\n2:45:07.080 --> 2:45:09.560\n And I failed polygraph completely.\n\n2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:12.800\n So they revoked the bond, took me back down\n\n2:45:12.800 --> 2:45:15.960\n to Charleston County, throw me into jail.\n\n2:45:15.960 --> 2:45:19.760\n Three days later, Secret Service shows back up\n\n2:45:19.760 --> 2:45:21.400\n and pulled me out of a cell.\n\n2:45:21.400 --> 2:45:23.320\n It's Jim Ramacone and Bobby Kirby.\n\n2:45:23.320 --> 2:45:27.240\n And I mean, honestly, they were good men.\n\n2:45:27.240 --> 2:45:30.920\n And they gave me chances upon chances to do the right thing.\n\n2:45:30.920 --> 2:45:33.560\n And I was not ready to do that.\n\n2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:36.640\n And Jim Ramacone and Bobby's in there.\n\n2:45:36.640 --> 2:45:39.240\n And Bobby, I mean, Bobby was a friend.\n\n2:45:39.240 --> 2:45:40.520\n I mean, he truly was.\n\n2:45:40.520 --> 2:45:50.520\n Later on, a couple of years ago, I had a chance to have lunch\n\n2:45:50.520 --> 2:45:51.320\n with a man.\n\n2:45:51.320 --> 2:45:55.080\n And I told him I was sorry for everything I did to him\n\n2:45:55.080 --> 2:45:58.000\n because I got him and another agent fired.\n\n2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:01.320\n And I told him I was sorry for what happened.\n\n2:46:01.320 --> 2:46:05.320\n And he told me then, he's like, we were your friends, man.\n\n2:46:05.320 --> 2:46:07.200\n We were truly your friends.\n\n2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:08.200\n So they were good men.\n\n2:46:08.200 --> 2:46:09.080\n They wanted to help.\n\n2:46:09.080 --> 2:46:10.360\n Yeah.\n\n2:46:10.360 --> 2:46:12.440\n They wanted you to be a good man.\n\n2:46:12.440 --> 2:46:13.800\n Yeah.\n\n2:46:13.800 --> 2:46:17.240\n What got me so damn bad is I told him,\n\n2:46:17.240 --> 2:46:19.400\n I was like, man, I'm trying to be a better guy.\n\n2:46:19.400 --> 2:46:22.560\n And he's like, Brett, you always were a good guy.\n\n2:46:22.560 --> 2:46:24.640\n You just didn't know it.\n\n2:46:24.640 --> 2:46:25.120\n Fuck.\n\n2:46:25.120 --> 2:46:28.120\n People like that, we need people like that in this world.\n\n2:46:28.120 --> 2:46:30.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:46:30.080 --> 2:46:33.760\n You need somebody to basically believe that you\n\n2:46:33.760 --> 2:46:35.360\n can be a good man.\n\n2:46:35.360 --> 2:46:37.200\n So Jim Ramacone pulls me out.\n\n2:46:37.200 --> 2:46:39.560\n He's the second in charge in South Carolina.\n\n2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:43.240\n He's got the Miranda waiver in front of him, right?\n\n2:46:43.240 --> 2:46:43.960\n And he looks at me.\n\n2:46:43.960 --> 2:46:45.840\n He's like, I'm playing hard ass.\n\n2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:49.440\n Bobby's over here looking distraught and like a hurt dog.\n\n2:46:49.440 --> 2:46:52.840\n And Jim's like, here's the way this is going to work.\n\n2:46:52.840 --> 2:46:55.320\n He said, you're going to tell me everything you've done\n\n2:46:55.320 --> 2:46:58.440\n the past six years, or I'm going to make it my mission in life\n\n2:46:58.440 --> 2:47:01.440\n to fuck over you and your family.\n\n2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:03.520\n And he said, not just this case.\n\n2:47:03.520 --> 2:47:05.840\n Once you get out of prison, I'll hound you\n\n2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:07.200\n the rest of your life.\n\n2:47:07.200 --> 2:47:09.080\n Then he slides the Miranda waiver over,\n\n2:47:09.080 --> 2:47:11.600\n and he's like, now you want to talk?\n\n2:47:11.600 --> 2:47:15.960\n And I looked at him, and I was like, nope.\n\n2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:19.360\n He was like, he gets up, gets all red in the face,\n\n2:47:19.360 --> 2:47:20.920\n storms out on the way out.\n\n2:47:20.920 --> 2:47:23.320\n He's like, fuck you very much.\n\n2:47:23.320 --> 2:47:24.800\n So I go back to the cell.\n\n2:47:24.800 --> 2:47:28.360\n A week later, I was only under state charges.\n\n2:47:28.360 --> 2:47:33.840\n A week later, judge rules they revoke the bond improperly.\n\n2:47:33.840 --> 2:47:36.440\n Wow.\n\n2:47:36.440 --> 2:47:37.860\n Reinstates the bond.\n\n2:47:37.860 --> 2:47:42.280\n Nobody calls the Secret Service to tell them I walk out.\n\n2:47:42.280 --> 2:47:43.000\n I walk out.\n\n2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:46.600\n I was dating this stripper, and I told my mom.\n\n2:47:46.600 --> 2:47:49.160\n I was like, well, if they're going to fuck me,\n\n2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:52.320\n they're going to have to find me.\n\n2:47:52.320 --> 2:47:53.600\n She just went on the move.\n\n2:47:53.600 --> 2:47:55.440\n Yeah, I called this stripper girl up.\n\n2:47:55.440 --> 2:47:58.600\n I'd given her like 60K, some bullshit like that.\n\n2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:01.920\n And I told her, I was like, Kim, I need some money.\n\n2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:03.400\n And she was like, what?\n\n2:48:03.400 --> 2:48:06.040\n I was like, look, I said, give me $1,000.\n\n2:48:06.040 --> 2:48:08.260\n I'll give you back $3,000 in two weeks.\n\n2:48:08.260 --> 2:48:09.000\n She was like, OK.\n\n2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:11.800\n So I met her in Augusta, Georgia,\n\n2:48:11.800 --> 2:48:16.640\n and got the $1,000 from her and started driving west on I20.\n\n2:48:16.640 --> 2:48:18.520\n No idea where to go to, anything else.\n\n2:48:18.520 --> 2:48:20.400\n Got to Dallas.\n\n2:48:20.400 --> 2:48:23.120\n There was a prepaid debit card supplier in Dallas.\n\n2:48:23.120 --> 2:48:26.560\n Went in, walked in the office, convinced the guy,\n\n2:48:26.560 --> 2:48:27.960\n social engineering, convinced the guy\n\n2:48:27.960 --> 2:48:30.280\n to give me 60 prepaid debit cards without a driver's\n\n2:48:30.280 --> 2:48:33.120\n license, without payment, anything else he did.\n\n2:48:33.120 --> 2:48:35.320\n And that started the run.\n\n2:48:35.320 --> 2:48:36.360\n I ended up stealing.\n\n2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:39.040\n From that, I stole like 160K profit,\n\n2:48:39.040 --> 2:48:41.080\n used that to buy a Jeep Cherokee.\n\n2:48:41.080 --> 2:48:43.920\n And the idea was to steal enough money\n\n2:48:43.920 --> 2:48:47.280\n to bug out to Florianopolis, Brazil,\n\n2:48:47.280 --> 2:48:51.720\n and set up shop down there, and do it again.\n\n2:48:51.720 --> 2:48:52.600\n That was the dream.\n\n2:48:52.600 --> 2:48:53.120\n That was it.\n\n2:48:53.120 --> 2:48:53.680\n That was it.\n\n2:48:53.680 --> 2:48:58.320\n So I was on the run for four months, stole $600,000.\n\n2:48:58.320 --> 2:49:00.000\n I was in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:02.120\n One day, I had stolen the night before.\n\n2:49:02.120 --> 2:49:05.280\n I had stolen 160K out of ATMs.\n\n2:49:05.280 --> 2:49:06.840\n Went in the next morning.\n\n2:49:06.840 --> 2:49:09.520\n I woke up, signed on to cartersmarket.com,\n\n2:49:09.520 --> 2:49:12.720\n which was ran by Max Butler, the ice man.\n\n2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:16.000\n And there's my name, US Most Wanted on it.\n\n2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:18.960\n And that gets your attention.\n\n2:49:18.960 --> 2:49:21.320\n That was my real name with the US Most Wanted beside of it.\n\n2:49:21.320 --> 2:49:24.000\n Nobody knew my real name in that environment at all.\n\n2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:25.160\n But then they did.\n\n2:49:25.160 --> 2:49:26.640\n And it was talking about me being\n\n2:49:26.640 --> 2:49:29.720\n part of the Secret Service, Operation Anglerfish,\n\n2:49:29.720 --> 2:49:31.280\n everything else.\n\n2:49:31.280 --> 2:49:33.920\n So of course, they're all like, everybody's after you.\n\n2:49:33.920 --> 2:49:36.760\n They're like, oh, yeah, we're going to get this son of a bitch.\n\n2:49:36.760 --> 2:49:38.160\n So I sat there looking at it.\n\n2:49:38.160 --> 2:49:39.520\n And I was like, said it out loud.\n\n2:49:39.520 --> 2:49:41.060\n I was like, well, Mr. Johnson, you've\n\n2:49:41.060 --> 2:49:42.920\n made the United States Most Wanted list.\n\n2:49:42.920 --> 2:49:44.120\n What do you do now?\n\n2:49:44.120 --> 2:49:47.760\n And I was like, I'm going to Disney World.\n\n2:49:47.760 --> 2:49:48.480\n Literally.\n\n2:49:48.480 --> 2:49:49.240\n Literally.\n\n2:49:49.240 --> 2:49:49.880\n Literally.\n\n2:49:49.880 --> 2:49:51.760\n Said that out loud.\n\n2:49:51.760 --> 2:49:54.280\n So loaded up the Jeep, drove from Las Vegas\n\n2:49:54.280 --> 2:49:59.760\n to Orlando, Florida, and got the two annual passes,\n\n2:49:59.760 --> 2:50:02.920\n one to Disney World, the other one to Universal Studios.\n\n2:50:02.920 --> 2:50:05.120\n Paid for a timeshare.\n\n2:50:05.120 --> 2:50:07.680\n They were building these new timeshares right off\n\n2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:10.760\n Universal Drive, building these brand new timeshares,\n\n2:50:10.760 --> 2:50:13.800\n paid for a timeshare in nine months, cash.\n\n2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:15.000\n I was like, we take cash?\n\n2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:15.920\n Yeah, we take cash.\n\n2:50:15.920 --> 2:50:18.040\n There's $12,900.\n\n2:50:18.040 --> 2:50:19.200\n Then it wasn't furnished.\n\n2:50:19.200 --> 2:50:20.760\n So I went down to a furniture store,\n\n2:50:20.760 --> 2:50:22.920\n bought $30,000 in furniture.\n\n2:50:22.920 --> 2:50:27.080\n They had seized a DVD collection of mine worth $30,000,\n\n2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:31.400\n bought that back, and proceeded to go to Disney World\n\n2:50:31.400 --> 2:50:32.040\n every day.\n\n2:50:32.040 --> 2:50:35.360\n And that lasted about six weeks.\n\n2:50:35.360 --> 2:50:37.800\n They used a trigger fish, is what they use.\n\n2:50:37.800 --> 2:50:42.040\n Nowadays, it's called a stingray to find me.\n\n2:50:42.040 --> 2:50:45.440\n So one day, it was like 1030 in the morning on Saturday.\n\n2:50:45.440 --> 2:50:48.400\n September 16 was the day, 2006.\n\n2:50:48.400 --> 2:50:50.960\n Yeah, 2006, September 16.\n\n2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:54.080\n I was used to the builders coming around knocking,\n\n2:50:54.080 --> 2:50:55.960\n making sure everything was all right.\n\n2:50:55.960 --> 2:50:59.240\n So I was asleep, heard this knock at the door,\n\n2:50:59.240 --> 2:51:02.160\n and get up, look through the keyhole, nobody's there.\n\n2:51:02.160 --> 2:51:03.600\n You know, people, nobody's there.\n\n2:51:03.600 --> 2:51:04.720\n I was like, huh.\n\n2:51:04.720 --> 2:51:06.960\n Open the door, step out into the hallway.\n\n2:51:06.960 --> 2:51:09.800\n Walking down the hall is Bobby Kirby,\n\n2:51:09.800 --> 2:51:14.680\n another South Carolina guy and a Orlando Orange County cop.\n\n2:51:14.680 --> 2:51:17.720\n And they turn around, and they're like, hey, Brett.\n\n2:51:17.720 --> 2:51:19.400\n And I'm like, hey, Bobby, how are you?\n\n2:51:19.400 --> 2:51:20.960\n And it's like, we're good, how are you?\n\n2:51:20.960 --> 2:51:23.400\n And I'm like, I'm fine, would you like to come in?\n\n2:51:23.400 --> 2:51:25.560\n He was like, let's put you in cuffs first.\n\n2:51:25.560 --> 2:51:28.840\n And I was like, that's probably a good idea.\n\n2:51:28.840 --> 2:51:33.040\n He was like, he walks in, he's like,\n\n2:51:33.040 --> 2:51:34.600\n have you got anything in here?\n\n2:51:34.600 --> 2:51:37.400\n And I was like, yeah, there's $120,000 in the bedroom.\n\n2:51:37.400 --> 2:51:39.080\n And he was like, seriously?\n\n2:51:39.080 --> 2:51:42.160\n I was like, yeah, that and an AK 47.\n\n2:51:42.160 --> 2:51:44.680\n His face goes white, and he's like, you've got a rifle?\n\n2:51:44.680 --> 2:51:48.880\n And I was like, no, I'm kidding with you.\n\n2:51:48.880 --> 2:51:50.760\n He was like, OK.\n\n2:51:50.760 --> 2:51:54.080\n So they throw me in jail in Orange County,\n\n2:51:54.080 --> 2:51:57.280\n and they give me diesel therapy.\n\n2:51:57.280 --> 2:52:01.560\n And diesel therapy is, it took like two weeks\n\n2:52:01.560 --> 2:52:04.800\n to transport me from Orange County, Orlando,\n\n2:52:04.800 --> 2:52:06.480\n to Columbia, South Carolina.\n\n2:52:06.480 --> 2:52:08.760\n And what happens is, is you stop at every county jail\n\n2:52:08.760 --> 2:52:11.560\n you possibly can, go through the processing, which\n\n2:52:11.560 --> 2:52:13.160\n is about six hours.\n\n2:52:13.160 --> 2:52:18.080\n Once you get to your bunk, hey, time to transport you.\n\n2:52:18.080 --> 2:52:19.880\n They do that on purpose?\n\n2:52:19.880 --> 2:52:21.600\n On purpose, on purpose.\n\n2:52:21.600 --> 2:52:24.760\n Wears you down mentally and physically and everything.\n\n2:52:24.760 --> 2:52:26.880\n I get to Columbia, South Carolina.\n\n2:52:26.880 --> 2:52:29.800\n Now, while I was at Orange County, what happens is,\n\n2:52:29.800 --> 2:52:32.680\n this inmate, because we were in federal holding,\n\n2:52:32.680 --> 2:52:33.800\n this inmate, he looks at me.\n\n2:52:33.800 --> 2:52:35.200\n His name was Yeti.\n\n2:52:35.200 --> 2:52:36.520\n And he's like, hey, man, you know,\n\n2:52:36.520 --> 2:52:38.960\n the only time you get off in federal prison\n\n2:52:38.960 --> 2:52:40.480\n is the drug program.\n\n2:52:40.480 --> 2:52:42.320\n I was like, well, man, I don't use drugs.\n\n2:52:42.320 --> 2:52:45.600\n And he's like, you can find a drug problem, can't you?\n\n2:52:45.600 --> 2:52:48.800\n And I was like, I can find a drug problem.\n\n2:52:48.800 --> 2:52:51.560\n So what happens is, is every county jail I stop at\n\n2:52:51.560 --> 2:52:56.800\n on the way to Columbia, I tell them I'm alcoholic and cocaine.\n\n2:52:56.800 --> 2:52:58.840\n So by the time I get to Columbia, South Carolina,\n\n2:52:58.840 --> 2:53:00.760\n they've got this paper trail of Mr. Johnson\n\n2:53:00.760 --> 2:53:02.080\n requesting help for drugs.\n\n2:53:04.760 --> 2:53:09.960\n I had hired Strom Thurmond's son as an attorney.\n\n2:53:09.960 --> 2:53:12.120\n They make me drop him because I paid for him\n\n2:53:12.120 --> 2:53:13.440\n with illegal funds.\n\n2:53:13.440 --> 2:53:15.880\n So they give me a public defender.\n\n2:53:15.880 --> 2:53:19.920\n He gets a psychological evaluation order for me.\n\n2:53:19.920 --> 2:53:22.640\n So psychologist comes in county jail, four hour interview.\n\n2:53:22.640 --> 2:53:24.200\n About halfway through, he looks at me,\n\n2:53:24.200 --> 2:53:25.800\n he's like, you using these type of drugs?\n\n2:53:25.800 --> 2:53:26.840\n I was like, yeah.\n\n2:53:26.840 --> 2:53:27.680\n What do you use?\n\n2:53:27.680 --> 2:53:28.400\n Cocaine.\n\n2:53:28.400 --> 2:53:29.400\n Smoke or snort?\n\n2:53:29.400 --> 2:53:29.920\n Snort.\n\n2:53:29.920 --> 2:53:30.400\n How much?\n\n2:53:30.400 --> 2:53:32.480\n An eight ball a day.\n\n2:53:32.480 --> 2:53:33.080\n That's a lot.\n\n2:53:33.080 --> 2:53:34.240\n Yeah.\n\n2:53:34.240 --> 2:53:36.280\n Do you have any trouble out of that?\n\n2:53:36.280 --> 2:53:37.960\n Yeah.\n\n2:53:37.960 --> 2:53:40.080\n I can't get an erection.\n\n2:53:40.080 --> 2:53:41.320\n And he looks at me.\n\n2:53:41.320 --> 2:53:44.440\n And I'm looking at him like, because I had gotten\n\n2:53:44.440 --> 2:53:46.000\n that shit from Boogie Nights.\n\n2:53:49.520 --> 2:53:51.840\n Finally, I'm like, is that right?\n\n2:53:51.840 --> 2:53:54.320\n And he was like, it could happen.\n\n2:53:54.320 --> 2:53:57.040\n I was like, OK.\n\n2:53:57.040 --> 2:54:00.960\n That makes it into my pre sentence report.\n\n2:54:00.960 --> 2:54:03.680\n So all federal inmates, probation office\n\n2:54:03.680 --> 2:54:07.080\n and prosecutor, they do this detailed background check\n\n2:54:07.080 --> 2:54:09.880\n to basically tell the judge how much time to give you.\n\n2:54:09.880 --> 2:54:14.640\n So that drug bit with that interview makes it into the PSR.\n\n2:54:14.640 --> 2:54:17.840\n So day of interview, I mean, day of sentencing.\n\n2:54:17.840 --> 2:54:21.280\n I had pled guilty, day of sentencing.\n\n2:54:21.280 --> 2:54:24.640\n The prosecutor, he stands up, and this dude\n\n2:54:24.640 --> 2:54:26.640\n is screaming at this point.\n\n2:54:26.640 --> 2:54:28.880\n And he's like, Mr. Johnson's manipulated\n\n2:54:28.880 --> 2:54:30.120\n the Secret Service.\n\n2:54:30.120 --> 2:54:31.640\n He's manipulated the prosecutor.\n\n2:54:31.640 --> 2:54:33.160\n Then he points at the judge.\n\n2:54:33.160 --> 2:54:35.600\n And he's manipulating you today, Your Honor.\n\n2:54:35.600 --> 2:54:38.400\n We insist on the upper limits of the guidelines.\n\n2:54:38.400 --> 2:54:40.480\n Well, I've been telling everybody in the jail\n\n2:54:40.480 --> 2:54:43.240\n that if they give me any more than 60 months,\n\n2:54:43.240 --> 2:54:45.000\n I am not staying.\n\n2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:47.880\n So we're like, OK, sure.\n\n2:54:47.880 --> 2:54:50.400\n So the judge looks at me.\n\n2:54:50.400 --> 2:54:51.760\n She's like, I agree.\n\n2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:55.040\n I'm like, she says, 75 months.\n\n2:54:55.040 --> 2:54:57.600\n So I looked at my lawyer, and I was like,\n\n2:54:57.600 --> 2:54:59.400\n can you get the drug program for me?\n\n2:54:59.400 --> 2:55:00.760\n He's like, I don't know why I ask.\n\n2:55:00.760 --> 2:55:02.920\n So he stands up.\n\n2:55:02.920 --> 2:55:05.520\n Your Honor, will you order the drug program for Mr. Johnson?\n\n2:55:05.520 --> 2:55:09.320\n The judge says, no, but I'll recommend he gets evaluated.\n\n2:55:09.320 --> 2:55:12.960\n So the Secret Service had told her, hey, he's full of shit.\n\n2:55:12.960 --> 2:55:15.000\n So she's like, no, but I'll recommend he gets evaluated.\n\n2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:16.960\n I looked at my lawyer, and I was like, what does that mean?\n\n2:55:16.960 --> 2:55:19.000\n He was like, you're probably not going to get it.\n\n2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:22.160\n I'm like, how soon can you get me to the camp?\n\n2:55:22.160 --> 2:55:24.760\n And he was like, well, if you don't appeal,\n\n2:55:24.760 --> 2:55:26.200\n I can get you there pretty quick.\n\n2:55:26.200 --> 2:55:29.080\n My exact words were, fuck the appeal.\n\n2:55:29.080 --> 2:55:30.320\n Get me to the camp.\n\n2:55:30.320 --> 2:55:31.800\n I'll take it from there.\n\n2:55:31.800 --> 2:55:35.400\n He looks at me like I'm the biggest idiot in the world.\n\n2:55:35.400 --> 2:55:38.400\n I get sent to, because you can get a camp recommended.\n\n2:55:38.400 --> 2:55:41.360\n I have friends, family members look\n\n2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:43.760\n for camps that don't have a fence around them.\n\n2:55:43.760 --> 2:55:47.120\n And we settle on Ashland, Kentucky.\n\n2:55:47.120 --> 2:55:49.120\n Six weeks later, I'm in Ashland, Kentucky,\n\n2:55:49.120 --> 2:55:53.960\n and pull up there, 14 foot fence, a razor wire on top.\n\n2:55:53.960 --> 2:55:58.720\n And I'm like, I don't climb fences, so I go in.\n\n2:55:58.720 --> 2:56:01.120\n First question I ask is, are there any jobs\n\n2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:02.160\n outside of the fence?\n\n2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:04.080\n And he was like, guards like, well, you\n\n2:56:04.080 --> 2:56:05.560\n can work in the national forest.\n\n2:56:05.560 --> 2:56:07.640\n And I'm like, no, I'll die out there.\n\n2:56:07.640 --> 2:56:09.680\n He was like, well, you could do landscaping.\n\n2:56:09.680 --> 2:56:13.320\n I'm like, I can run a weed eater.\n\n2:56:13.320 --> 2:56:16.920\n Two days later, I walk into the landscaping office,\n\n2:56:16.920 --> 2:56:19.520\n and the cop, this is this genius of some\n\n2:56:19.520 --> 2:56:21.160\n of these people and institutions.\n\n2:56:21.160 --> 2:56:25.480\n The cop, behind his desk, the entire wall\n\n2:56:25.480 --> 2:56:29.720\n is a blown up photo of the compound and the outlying area.\n\n2:56:29.720 --> 2:56:35.000\n So I can literally sit there and plot where I'm going.\n\n2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:40.520\n My dad, I hadn't spoken to that man in years.\n\n2:56:40.520 --> 2:56:44.800\n And he shows up at my sentencing and stands up\n\n2:56:44.800 --> 2:56:45.720\n in front of the judge.\n\n2:56:45.720 --> 2:56:47.560\n And he's like, Your Honor, I want to make\n\n2:56:47.560 --> 2:56:49.680\n sure Brett gets a good start.\n\n2:56:49.680 --> 2:56:52.680\n He can live with me when he gets out, everything else.\n\n2:56:52.680 --> 2:56:54.720\n Looking back, the man meant that.\n\n2:56:54.720 --> 2:56:58.240\n And I just thought it was bullshit at the time.\n\n2:56:58.240 --> 2:57:00.560\n So he starts to visit me in prison.\n\n2:57:00.560 --> 2:57:02.320\n I mean, yeah, in prison, he starts to visit.\n\n2:57:02.320 --> 2:57:05.120\n And about the third visit in, he looks at me.\n\n2:57:05.120 --> 2:57:07.720\n He's like, I've been reading about you online.\n\n2:57:07.720 --> 2:57:08.200\n I was like, yeah.\n\n2:57:08.200 --> 2:57:09.480\n He's like, yeah.\n\n2:57:09.480 --> 2:57:11.240\n He's like, that's a lot of money you made.\n\n2:57:11.240 --> 2:57:12.520\n And I was like, yeah.\n\n2:57:12.520 --> 2:57:15.440\n He's like, you think you can teach somebody\n\n2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:16.200\n how to do that?\n\n2:57:16.200 --> 2:57:21.640\n And I'm like, so what I used to say,\n\n2:57:21.640 --> 2:57:25.000\n and again, it's this thing of really coming\n\n2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:26.120\n to terms with things.\n\n2:57:26.120 --> 2:57:31.800\n What I used to say was I thought my dad was back in my life\n\n2:57:31.800 --> 2:57:35.080\n and that he was just trying to use me.\n\n2:57:35.080 --> 2:57:38.000\n The truth of the matter was is that my dad\n\n2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:43.360\n hadn't really seen me except in that frame of crime,\n\n2:57:43.360 --> 2:57:46.600\n being that criminal with my mom, everything else.\n\n2:57:46.600 --> 2:57:48.280\n I really think that's how the man was trying\n\n2:57:48.280 --> 2:57:50.000\n to communicate with me.\n\n2:57:50.000 --> 2:57:52.040\n He wanted to connect with you in the places\n\n2:57:52.040 --> 2:57:54.840\n where you know, where you love, where you're interested in,\n\n2:57:54.840 --> 2:57:56.440\n where your addiction is, essentially.\n\n2:57:56.440 --> 2:58:00.000\n And what I did is I manipulated the man\n\n2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:01.920\n into helping me escape.\n\n2:58:01.920 --> 2:58:04.240\n So I agreed to teach him how to do tax fraud.\n\n2:58:04.240 --> 2:58:06.840\n And in return, the only money he had to his name,\n\n2:58:06.840 --> 2:58:09.080\n he had $4,000 cash.\n\n2:58:09.080 --> 2:58:11.280\n So I manipulated him into giving me that\n\n2:58:11.280 --> 2:58:13.840\n and to dropping me off a change of clothes, a cell phone,\n\n2:58:13.840 --> 2:58:14.840\n and a driver's license.\n\n2:58:14.840 --> 2:58:17.040\n The only driver's license he had was my driver's license,\n\n2:58:17.040 --> 2:58:18.360\n Brett Johnson.\n\n2:58:18.360 --> 2:58:22.720\n So I was at the camp for, I don't know, six, eight weeks.\n\n2:58:22.720 --> 2:58:26.840\n And the hardest worker that landscaping had ever seen.\n\n2:58:26.840 --> 2:58:29.720\n At one point, the cops got me on a mountainside\n\n2:58:29.720 --> 2:58:31.680\n with a broom, sweeping off the mountain.\n\n2:58:31.680 --> 2:58:34.160\n I'm like, yeah, we'll do that, absolutely.\n\n2:58:34.160 --> 2:58:36.160\n So you're building trust with the guys there.\n\n2:58:36.160 --> 2:58:37.480\n Yeah, working my ass off.\n\n2:58:37.480 --> 2:58:39.720\n And in six weeks, I take off.\n\n2:58:39.720 --> 2:58:42.920\n And I lasted, I think, two, three weeks, something\n\n2:58:42.920 --> 2:58:43.680\n like that.\n\n2:58:43.680 --> 2:58:45.000\n US Marshals, I made it 100.\n\n2:58:45.000 --> 2:58:45.960\n They called you escaped.\n\n2:58:45.960 --> 2:58:46.680\n Yeah, escaped.\n\n2:58:46.680 --> 2:58:47.600\n Escaped.\n\n2:58:47.600 --> 2:58:50.120\n US Marshals, they're canvassing a three state area.\n\n2:58:50.120 --> 2:58:52.000\n They found me, I think, 250 miles away.\n\n2:58:52.000 --> 2:58:53.800\n It's like Lexington, Kentucky.\n\n2:58:53.800 --> 2:58:55.720\n They found me in Lexington because I had\n\n2:58:55.720 --> 2:58:57.360\n to use my real driver's license.\n\n2:58:57.360 --> 2:58:59.120\n I had a laptop.\n\n2:58:59.120 --> 2:59:00.920\n I had prepaid debit cards.\n\n2:59:00.920 --> 2:59:03.040\n And I had stolen identity information.\n\n2:59:03.040 --> 2:59:09.240\n And the way it got me was I had dyed my hair this flaming red.\n\n2:59:09.240 --> 2:59:10.280\n I had this deep tan.\n\n2:59:10.280 --> 2:59:11.920\n I didn't look anything like myself.\n\n2:59:11.920 --> 2:59:18.160\n And I was at a hotel, had the curtains open, saw this guy.\n\n2:59:18.160 --> 2:59:21.120\n I was on the laptop, saw this guy walk by.\n\n2:59:21.120 --> 2:59:24.600\n He walks by the window, and he stops.\n\n2:59:24.600 --> 2:59:26.560\n And then he backs up.\n\n2:59:26.560 --> 2:59:28.120\n He looks inside.\n\n2:59:28.120 --> 2:59:30.080\n He knocks on the window.\n\n2:59:30.080 --> 2:59:31.080\n I look up at him.\n\n2:59:31.080 --> 2:59:32.680\n He's like, you.\n\n2:59:32.680 --> 2:59:33.480\n I was like, me?\n\n2:59:33.480 --> 2:59:34.840\n He's like, you.\n\n2:59:34.840 --> 2:59:37.520\n Then he pulls out this badge, and he points at it.\n\n2:59:37.520 --> 2:59:39.920\n He's like, and then he points at the door.\n\n2:59:39.920 --> 2:59:41.320\n Now!\n\n2:59:41.320 --> 2:59:42.480\n So I was like, oh, OK.\n\n2:59:42.480 --> 2:59:44.080\n So I open up the door.\n\n2:59:44.080 --> 2:59:47.480\n He's like, US Marshals Service.\n\n2:59:47.480 --> 2:59:49.240\n So they arrest me.\n\n2:59:49.240 --> 2:59:50.600\n How did they track you down?\n\n2:59:50.600 --> 2:59:51.640\n They canvassed that area.\n\n2:59:51.640 --> 2:59:54.880\n They talked to every hotel, everything else.\n\n2:59:54.880 --> 2:59:57.200\n So it's like a traditional, like, they were just tracking?\n\n2:59:57.200 --> 2:59:58.440\n Traditional police work is what it was.\n\n2:59:58.440 --> 2:59:59.960\n So it wasn't like, from the internet,\n\n2:59:59.960 --> 3:00:01.080\n they kind of got something?\n\n3:00:01.080 --> 3:00:02.200\n I don't know, just straight police work.\n\n3:00:02.200 --> 3:00:03.200\n Good, good, good, good.\n\n3:00:03.200 --> 3:00:05.800\n US Marshals are outstanding in everything they do.\n\n3:00:05.800 --> 3:00:06.760\n So they arrest me.\n\n3:00:06.760 --> 3:00:09.320\n I go to a, I'm initially held at a county\n\n3:00:09.320 --> 3:00:11.240\n jail in Moorhead, Kentucky.\n\n3:00:11.240 --> 3:00:14.600\n And that, man, that was one hell of an experience there.\n\n3:00:14.600 --> 3:00:17.360\n But then I'm transferred after sentencing on that.\n\n3:00:17.360 --> 3:00:20.440\n So sentencing, here's the weird thing.\n\n3:00:20.440 --> 3:00:23.000\n So I spend like, I think, two or three months at the county\n\n3:00:23.000 --> 3:00:26.200\n jail in Moorhead, Kentucky.\n\n3:00:26.200 --> 3:00:27.480\n Get sentenced.\n\n3:00:27.480 --> 3:00:31.600\n At my sentencing, it happens so quickly\n\n3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:34.000\n after the initial sentencing that they\n\n3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:36.360\n use the exact same presentence report.\n\n3:00:36.360 --> 3:00:39.120\n The report that's got all that drug shit in there.\n\n3:00:39.120 --> 3:00:42.080\n So at my sentencing, prosecutor's there,\n\n3:00:42.080 --> 3:00:47.640\n Secret Service is there, judge, me, and my attorney.\n\n3:00:47.640 --> 3:00:48.640\n Prosecutor stands up.\n\n3:00:48.640 --> 3:00:50.760\n He's like, Your Honor, we would like\n\n3:00:50.760 --> 3:00:54.160\n it if you would consider that when Mr. Johnson was arrested,\n\n3:00:54.160 --> 3:00:56.600\n he had a laptop, he had all this information with him,\n\n3:00:56.600 --> 3:01:00.040\n looks like he was engaged in identity theft yet again.\n\n3:01:00.040 --> 3:01:03.160\n Judge looks at the prosecutor, says no.\n\n3:01:03.160 --> 3:01:05.240\n Says, hey, if you were going to charge him with it,\n\n3:01:05.240 --> 3:01:06.780\n you should have charged him with it.\n\n3:01:06.780 --> 3:01:08.520\n I'm only considering the escape.\n\n3:01:08.520 --> 3:01:09.760\n Then he looks at me.\n\n3:01:09.760 --> 3:01:11.600\n He's like, Mr. Johnson.\n\n3:01:11.600 --> 3:01:14.240\n He said, it looks like by you keeping your mouth shut right\n\n3:01:14.240 --> 3:01:16.720\n now, you're really saving yourself\n\n3:01:16.720 --> 3:01:17.760\n a pretty serious charge.\n\n3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:20.360\n And my response was, yes, Your Honor.\n\n3:01:20.360 --> 3:01:22.680\n And he was like, then he opens up the presentence report,\n\n3:01:22.680 --> 3:01:24.240\n he's fingering through, and he's like,\n\n3:01:24.240 --> 3:01:26.560\n it also looks like before you got\n\n3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:30.040\n involved with all these drugs, you were a pretty good citizen.\n\n3:01:30.040 --> 3:01:33.160\n I was like, yes, Your Honor.\n\n3:01:33.160 --> 3:01:34.760\n And he's like, so here's what I'm going to do.\n\n3:01:34.760 --> 3:01:38.720\n He said, I'm going to give you 18 months on the escape.\n\n3:01:38.720 --> 3:01:39.680\n I was like, OK.\n\n3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:41.240\n He said, I'm also going to give you,\n\n3:01:41.240 --> 3:01:42.320\n no, it's 15 months on the escape.\n\n3:01:42.320 --> 3:01:44.040\n He said, I'm going to give you 15 months on the escape.\n\n3:01:44.040 --> 3:01:48.760\n He said, and I'm also going to order the drug program for you.\n\n3:01:48.760 --> 3:01:51.720\n I was like, yes, Your Honor.\n\n3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:54.920\n So the drug program gives you a year off,\n\n3:01:54.920 --> 3:01:59.240\n and it gives you six months and halfway house.\n\n3:01:59.240 --> 3:02:03.600\n So by escaping, I got out of prison three months earlier\n\n3:02:03.600 --> 3:02:05.520\n than what I should have gotten out of it.\n\n3:02:05.520 --> 3:02:11.160\n So the original thing about drugs worked in the long term.\n\n3:02:11.160 --> 3:02:12.680\n The interesting thing with that, and this\n\n3:02:12.680 --> 3:02:14.240\n was the best lie I ever told, honestly,\n\n3:02:14.240 --> 3:02:17.360\n the best lie I ever told.\n\n3:02:17.360 --> 3:02:21.800\n I spent eight months in solitary confinement, eight months.\n\n3:02:21.800 --> 3:02:24.160\n And that's an experience.\n\n3:02:24.160 --> 3:02:27.440\n Because you ain't got no books for the first month or so,\n\n3:02:27.440 --> 3:02:30.480\n then they give you a King James Bible.\n\n3:02:30.480 --> 3:02:31.720\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:31.720 --> 3:02:34.920\n And then for a month, no books.\n\n3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:36.360\n No books for a month.\n\n3:02:36.360 --> 3:02:38.280\n This is a pretty small and.\n\n3:02:38.280 --> 3:02:39.200\n Six by nine room.\n\n3:02:39.200 --> 3:02:40.160\n Six by nine.\n\n3:02:40.160 --> 3:02:41.240\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:41.240 --> 3:02:41.920\n No books.\n\n3:02:41.920 --> 3:02:44.400\n No books, no paper, no pen, no pencil.\n\n3:02:44.400 --> 3:02:45.560\n You're alone with your mind.\n\n3:02:45.560 --> 3:02:48.280\n You got a mat, a toilet.\n\n3:02:48.280 --> 3:02:50.120\n What's that like?\n\n3:02:50.120 --> 3:02:52.240\n You sleep as much as you can.\n\n3:02:52.240 --> 3:02:55.640\n You're sleeping 16, 18 hours a day is what you're doing.\n\n3:02:55.640 --> 3:03:00.720\n What about, were you thinking about even just going back\n\n3:03:00.720 --> 3:03:01.800\n like Elizabeth?\n\n3:03:01.800 --> 3:03:02.520\n You think about.\n\n3:03:02.520 --> 3:03:03.640\n You go through all that.\n\n3:03:03.640 --> 3:03:04.200\n The whole thing.\n\n3:03:04.200 --> 3:03:04.920\n Through all that.\n\n3:03:04.920 --> 3:03:05.560\n Every bit.\n\n3:03:05.560 --> 3:03:06.640\n Your mom, too.\n\n3:03:06.640 --> 3:03:07.120\n Yeah.\n\n3:03:07.120 --> 3:03:08.760\n Going through every single bit of that.\n\n3:03:08.760 --> 3:03:12.920\n And so you're supposed to get out an hour a day.\n\n3:03:12.920 --> 3:03:15.320\n Law says you're supposed to get out an hour a day.\n\n3:03:15.320 --> 3:03:16.320\n That's the law.\n\n3:03:16.320 --> 3:03:18.160\n That's not the way things actually happen.\n\n3:03:18.160 --> 3:03:21.520\n What actually happens is you're lucky to get out an hour a week.\n\n3:03:21.520 --> 3:03:25.280\n You take a shower twice a week, and that's it.\n\n3:03:25.280 --> 3:03:26.840\n You get a phone call once a month.\n\n3:03:26.840 --> 3:03:28.760\n Oh, so you don't get to see nature.\n\n3:03:28.760 --> 3:03:29.640\n Don't see anything.\n\n3:03:29.640 --> 3:03:31.640\n You're getting solitary.\n\n3:03:31.640 --> 3:03:34.200\n And it takes about a week.\n\n3:03:34.200 --> 3:03:36.440\n The first week is the roughest.\n\n3:03:36.440 --> 3:03:38.400\n You're bouncing off the walls that first week\n\n3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:40.640\n because you can't sleep, can't do anything else.\n\n3:03:40.640 --> 3:03:43.560\n Then you start to adapt to it after a while.\n\n3:03:43.560 --> 3:03:46.480\n When that book does arrive, you're happy as hell to have it.\n\n3:03:46.480 --> 3:03:49.840\n I'm well versed in King James Bible.\n\n3:03:49.840 --> 3:03:51.840\n So you're happy to have it.\n\n3:03:51.840 --> 3:03:53.760\n Then finally, you get other books\n\n3:03:53.760 --> 3:03:56.280\n that come in from that point.\n\n3:03:56.280 --> 3:03:57.720\n Spent eight months at that.\n\n3:03:57.720 --> 3:04:02.640\n And they send me out to a real prison, Big Spring, Texas,\n\n3:04:02.640 --> 3:04:07.200\n West Texas, where have you been out there?\n\n3:04:07.200 --> 3:04:07.680\n No.\n\n3:04:07.680 --> 3:04:08.160\n Man.\n\n3:04:08.160 --> 3:04:10.000\n But I could tell.\n\n3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:13.160\n Prairie dogs and tarantulas is what it is.\n\n3:04:13.160 --> 3:04:16.400\n No kidding, it gets so hot that warnings\n\n3:04:16.400 --> 3:04:19.720\n come on the radio telling you not to drive on certain streets\n\n3:04:19.720 --> 3:04:21.120\n because they're melted.\n\n3:04:21.120 --> 3:04:23.560\n That's Big Spring.\n\n3:04:23.560 --> 3:04:26.760\n So if you've seen the movie From Dusk\n\n3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:30.880\n Till Dawn, the opening scene is in Big Spring, Texas.\n\n3:04:30.880 --> 3:04:31.440\n So it's hot.\n\n3:04:31.440 --> 3:04:33.240\n Yeah, very hot.\n\n3:04:33.240 --> 3:04:35.360\n And that's where I find out what a real prison is.\n\n3:04:35.360 --> 3:04:38.520\n And it's not ran by guards.\n\n3:04:38.520 --> 3:04:40.280\n Prisons are ran by inmates.\n\n3:04:40.280 --> 3:04:41.760\n And that's a fact.\n\n3:04:41.760 --> 3:04:47.440\n So you're met at the door by whatever race you are\n\n3:04:47.440 --> 3:04:48.200\n is what happens.\n\n3:04:48.200 --> 3:04:50.840\n So Big Spring is a converted Air Force compound.\n\n3:04:50.840 --> 3:04:52.160\n It's a disciplinary prison.\n\n3:04:52.160 --> 3:04:54.200\n So you get the bad guys are in there.\n\n3:04:54.200 --> 3:05:00.160\n So I go through processing, and I'm walking up to the unit,\n\n3:05:00.160 --> 3:05:03.560\n and I'm met at the door by a guy named Nick Sandifer.\n\n3:05:03.560 --> 3:05:06.120\n He's the treasurer of the Aryan Brotherhood.\n\n3:05:06.120 --> 3:05:08.640\n And first question out of his mouth\n\n3:05:08.640 --> 3:05:10.640\n is, any more white guys come in?\n\n3:05:10.640 --> 3:05:11.680\n And shit, I didn't know.\n\n3:05:11.680 --> 3:05:13.760\n I was like, hell, I don't know, four or five?\n\n3:05:13.760 --> 3:05:17.360\n Next question is, what are you in here for?\n\n3:05:17.360 --> 3:05:19.360\n My answer was, because I'm like, I got no worries.\n\n3:05:19.360 --> 3:05:20.920\n My answer was, computer crime.\n\n3:05:20.920 --> 3:05:22.760\n Smiled at him.\n\n3:05:22.760 --> 3:05:27.160\n Turns out, wrong thing to say, because computer crime is not\n\n3:05:27.160 --> 3:05:30.080\n credit card theft or hacking or any bullshit like that.\n\n3:05:30.080 --> 3:05:34.080\n Computer crime in prison is child pornography.\n\n3:05:34.080 --> 3:05:35.440\n So tell him that.\n\n3:05:35.440 --> 3:05:37.680\n He looks at me like I'm a piece of shit,\n\n3:05:37.680 --> 3:05:38.920\n goes and gets his buddies.\n\n3:05:38.920 --> 3:05:40.760\n They circle around.\n\n3:05:40.760 --> 3:05:41.760\n What are you in here for?\n\n3:05:41.760 --> 3:05:45.040\n I like how the Aryan Brotherhood has lines.\n\n3:05:45.040 --> 3:05:47.920\n They're like, oh, yeah, this is child porn.\n\n3:05:47.920 --> 3:05:48.760\n That's it.\n\n3:05:48.760 --> 3:05:49.920\n That's the bad guy.\n\n3:05:49.920 --> 3:05:50.680\n They circle around.\n\n3:05:50.680 --> 3:05:53.360\n They're like, what did you say you're in here for?\n\n3:05:53.360 --> 3:05:55.760\n So I'm sitting there trying to explain it to them.\n\n3:05:55.760 --> 3:05:57.280\n They're like, you tell a good story.\n\n3:05:57.280 --> 3:05:59.440\n You still said this.\n\n3:05:59.440 --> 3:06:02.120\n Computer crime basically really does\n\n3:06:02.120 --> 3:06:04.760\n mean usually child pornography.\n\n3:06:04.760 --> 3:06:06.120\n In prison, yeah.\n\n3:06:06.120 --> 3:06:08.320\n And what you see, and that's one of things you find out,\n\n3:06:08.320 --> 3:06:10.960\n the guys that are going in there for child porn,\n\n3:06:10.960 --> 3:06:14.120\n they will tell them it's credit card theft.\n\n3:06:14.120 --> 3:06:15.400\n So yeah.\n\n3:06:15.400 --> 3:06:15.880\n Right.\n\n3:06:15.880 --> 3:06:16.680\n They've learned.\n\n3:06:16.680 --> 3:06:17.920\n So I'm that guy.\n\n3:06:17.920 --> 3:06:19.840\n But you also don't, I mean, for people\n\n3:06:19.840 --> 3:06:22.840\n who are just listening to this, you don't exactly look\n\n3:06:22.840 --> 3:06:24.840\n like the typical computer hacker.\n\n3:06:24.840 --> 3:06:25.680\n That's true.\n\n3:06:25.680 --> 3:06:26.360\n That's true.\n\n3:06:26.360 --> 3:06:27.480\n That's very true.\n\n3:06:27.480 --> 3:06:29.320\n But I don't look like the pedophile either.\n\n3:06:29.320 --> 3:06:30.640\n That's right.\n\n3:06:30.640 --> 3:06:31.480\n That's right.\n\n3:06:31.480 --> 3:06:34.080\n But it's like it doesn't make it seem like you're, I mean,\n\n3:06:34.080 --> 3:06:36.000\n I guess you're not wearing a hoodie,\n\n3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:41.040\n and you're not like emo, dark.\n\n3:06:41.040 --> 3:06:43.160\n The way it actually works in prison,\n\n3:06:43.160 --> 3:06:47.520\n they won't attack you until they know.\n\n3:06:47.520 --> 3:06:50.920\n So they have to see paperwork, which now in federal prison,\n\n3:06:50.920 --> 3:06:54.280\n you don't get transported with paperwork because of that.\n\n3:06:54.280 --> 3:06:57.000\n So they have to see paperwork, or a guard\n\n3:06:57.000 --> 3:07:00.680\n will tell them what you're in there for.\n\n3:07:00.680 --> 3:07:02.480\n Guards will tell who the pedophiles are.\n\n3:07:02.480 --> 3:07:06.000\n So none of the guards told them that it was anything.\n\n3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:08.080\n So for the first month, they think I am,\n\n3:07:08.080 --> 3:07:09.720\n but they're not doing anything because they\n\n3:07:09.720 --> 3:07:10.960\n don't know for sure.\n\n3:07:10.960 --> 3:07:12.360\n At the end of the first month, I'd\n\n3:07:12.360 --> 3:07:15.680\n been talking to Kevin Polson over at Wired Magazine\n\n3:07:15.680 --> 3:07:17.680\n about Max Butler.\n\n3:07:17.680 --> 3:07:19.000\n He does an article about that.\n\n3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:20.400\n It shows up in Wired Magazine.\n\n3:07:20.400 --> 3:07:21.360\n So at the end of the first month,\n\n3:07:21.360 --> 3:07:24.880\n Wired Magazine hits a compound, front cover, all the story.\n\n3:07:24.880 --> 3:07:25.720\n You would think.\n\n3:07:25.720 --> 3:07:27.240\n You would think it saved me.\n\n3:07:27.240 --> 3:07:29.640\n So I'm reading the article, really happy about it.\n\n3:07:29.640 --> 3:07:31.920\n So what happens is four o clock is mail call.\n\n3:07:31.920 --> 3:07:34.000\n Four o clock's a stand up count nationwide.\n\n3:07:34.000 --> 3:07:35.520\n After four o clock is your mail call.\n\n3:07:35.520 --> 3:07:37.160\n They hand out all the mail for the day.\n\n3:07:37.160 --> 3:07:38.800\n So the mail comes, I get the magazine.\n\n3:07:38.800 --> 3:07:39.800\n I'm reading through it.\n\n3:07:39.800 --> 3:07:41.560\n I'm like, well, shit, I'm good to go.\n\n3:07:41.560 --> 3:07:45.760\n Then it says, Brett Johnson, Secret Service informant\n\n3:07:45.760 --> 3:07:47.520\n in the article.\n\n3:07:47.520 --> 3:07:49.560\n So you're now a snitch.\n\n3:07:49.560 --> 3:07:51.480\n Which is right up there with the pedophiles.\n\n3:07:51.480 --> 3:07:55.400\n So we go to dinner after that.\n\n3:07:55.400 --> 3:07:57.120\n At dinner, you can hear it.\n\n3:07:57.120 --> 3:07:57.920\n You can hear the chat.\n\n3:07:57.920 --> 3:07:58.760\n We got a snitch.\n\n3:07:58.760 --> 3:08:01.000\n I think it's that guy over there.\n\n3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:04.680\n Warden, next day, shuts down the entire compound,\n\n3:08:04.680 --> 3:08:06.080\n calls me into his office.\n\n3:08:06.080 --> 3:08:07.160\n They got security there.\n\n3:08:07.160 --> 3:08:08.480\n They got the counselors there and everything else.\n\n3:08:08.480 --> 3:08:09.280\n Warden looks at me.\n\n3:08:09.280 --> 3:08:12.680\n He's like, did you give an interview to Wired Magazine?\n\n3:08:12.680 --> 3:08:13.920\n I'm like, yeah.\n\n3:08:13.920 --> 3:08:17.240\n He's like, do you not know they will kill you in here?\n\n3:08:17.240 --> 3:08:21.840\n I was like, he was like, do you feel safe?\n\n3:08:21.840 --> 3:08:24.440\n Well, I know if you tell me you don't feel safe,\n\n3:08:24.440 --> 3:08:25.280\n they transport you.\n\n3:08:25.280 --> 3:08:27.160\n Transport you means another eight months\n\n3:08:27.160 --> 3:08:28.680\n in solitary confinement.\n\n3:08:28.680 --> 3:08:31.880\n You start to see shit in solitary after a while.\n\n3:08:31.880 --> 3:08:33.240\n So I'm like, no, not gonna do that.\n\n3:08:33.240 --> 3:08:34.960\n So I'm like, completely safe.\n\n3:08:34.960 --> 3:08:37.200\n He was like, look, he's like,\n\n3:08:37.200 --> 3:08:42.160\n if anybody says anything to you, immediately come to us\n\n3:08:42.160 --> 3:08:44.640\n because they'll fucking kill you.\n\n3:08:44.640 --> 3:08:45.880\n So they do a locker search,\n\n3:08:45.880 --> 3:08:47.200\n try to confiscate the magazines.\n\n3:08:47.200 --> 3:08:48.040\n They can't.\n\n3:08:48.040 --> 3:08:50.320\n The next day, I walk into the unit.\n\n3:08:50.320 --> 3:08:52.200\n There's Nick Sandefur laying on his bunk,\n\n3:08:52.200 --> 3:08:53.960\n magazine wide open reading it.\n\n3:08:53.960 --> 3:08:55.640\n I'm like, oh shit.\n\n3:08:55.640 --> 3:08:56.480\n Walked up to him.\n\n3:08:56.480 --> 3:08:58.440\n I was like, hey, Nick, what are you doing?\n\n3:08:58.440 --> 3:09:00.080\n He's like, oh, doing some reading.\n\n3:09:00.080 --> 3:09:01.320\n I was like, anything interesting?\n\n3:09:01.320 --> 3:09:03.560\n He's like, it's getting there.\n\n3:09:03.560 --> 3:09:07.080\n I was like, let me save you the trouble.\n\n3:09:07.080 --> 3:09:08.560\n Take the magazine, turn it over to the page.\n\n3:09:08.560 --> 3:09:10.960\n I was like, right there is what you're looking for.\n\n3:09:10.960 --> 3:09:12.680\n He was like, man, I already knew.\n\n3:09:12.680 --> 3:09:15.640\n I was like, do we have a problem?\n\n3:09:15.640 --> 3:09:16.480\n And he looks at me.\n\n3:09:16.480 --> 3:09:20.120\n He's like, is anyone on the compound you told on?\n\n3:09:20.120 --> 3:09:21.280\n I was like, no.\n\n3:09:21.280 --> 3:09:24.680\n He's like, until someone gets here, you snitched on.\n\n3:09:24.680 --> 3:09:26.000\n We're okay.\n\n3:09:26.000 --> 3:09:28.160\n I was like, okay.\n\n3:09:28.160 --> 3:09:31.240\n He's like, but I need you to do something for me.\n\n3:09:32.120 --> 3:09:35.280\n All right, so in federal prison, you gotta have a job.\n\n3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:36.120\n Everybody works.\n\n3:09:36.120 --> 3:09:37.600\n It doesn't matter what you do, but you gotta work.\n\n3:09:37.600 --> 3:09:41.240\n I got a job in education teaching a lit class.\n\n3:09:42.120 --> 3:09:45.320\n Every Wednesday, six to 8.30 PM, lit.\n\n3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:48.840\n And had all, every area on the compound\n\n3:09:48.840 --> 3:09:50.280\n signs up for the lit class.\n\n3:09:50.280 --> 3:09:52.440\n Had a couple of guards every now and then popped in.\n\n3:09:52.440 --> 3:09:54.880\n And did we teach lit?\n\n3:09:54.880 --> 3:09:56.920\n No, we taught fraud.\n\n3:09:56.920 --> 3:09:59.920\n Every Wednesday, six to 8.30 PM.\n\n3:09:59.920 --> 3:10:02.160\n That's how I didn't get my ass beaten.\n\n3:10:02.160 --> 3:10:04.720\n And my other job, I had two jobs with them.\n\n3:10:04.720 --> 3:10:07.840\n The other job, you get to the point, it's weird, man.\n\n3:10:07.840 --> 3:10:11.720\n You get to the point, people walking off the bus,\n\n3:10:11.720 --> 3:10:14.040\n you know immediately two groups of people.\n\n3:10:14.040 --> 3:10:16.760\n You know who the bank robbers are immediately.\n\n3:10:16.760 --> 3:10:18.120\n Just by them walking off the bus,\n\n3:10:18.120 --> 3:10:20.400\n you're like, that motherfucker's a bank robber.\n\n3:10:20.400 --> 3:10:23.600\n And you know who the pedophiles are immediately.\n\n3:10:23.600 --> 3:10:27.200\n So my job as the white guy was to approach\n\n3:10:27.200 --> 3:10:29.880\n the white pedophiles and have a conversation.\n\n3:10:29.880 --> 3:10:31.080\n And the conversation was basically,\n\n3:10:31.080 --> 3:10:34.680\n hey, don't know what you're in here for.\n\n3:10:34.680 --> 3:10:37.000\n Don't care what you're in here for.\n\n3:10:37.000 --> 3:10:40.040\n But if you got some sort of fucked up charge,\n\n3:10:40.960 --> 3:10:42.000\n you need to tell me.\n\n3:10:43.160 --> 3:10:46.320\n If you tell me, everything's gonna be all right.\n\n3:10:46.320 --> 3:10:49.480\n If you don't tell me, you see those guys over there?\n\n3:10:49.480 --> 3:10:51.200\n If you start to associate with them\n\n3:10:51.200 --> 3:10:52.600\n or they start to talk to you,\n\n3:10:52.600 --> 3:10:55.480\n and then they find out you're in here on something,\n\n3:10:55.480 --> 3:10:57.240\n they're gonna kill you.\n\n3:10:57.240 --> 3:10:59.640\n And what are the things, pedophile?\n\n3:10:59.640 --> 3:11:02.680\n Pedophile, rapist, anything that harms children,\n\n3:11:02.680 --> 3:11:04.760\n harms women, anything like that.\n\n3:11:04.760 --> 3:11:07.120\n And there are, it's like the mob,\n\n3:11:07.120 --> 3:11:10.440\n there's rules, there's an ethical code.\n\n3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:14.200\n Even if you have the division between races on all that,\n\n3:11:15.160 --> 3:11:17.760\n you still have these lines drawn.\n\n3:11:17.760 --> 3:11:19.680\n And there's a hierarchy too.\n\n3:11:19.680 --> 3:11:20.520\n Very, very much so.\n\n3:11:20.520 --> 3:11:22.000\n And what that looks like in prison,\n\n3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:25.080\n depending on the, it depends on the security class\n\n3:11:25.080 --> 3:11:27.640\n that you're in, what level prison.\n\n3:11:27.640 --> 3:11:29.840\n But at that prison, what that looked like\n\n3:11:29.840 --> 3:11:33.320\n was you're not allowed to talk to anybody.\n\n3:11:33.320 --> 3:11:35.480\n You're not allowed to watch television.\n\n3:11:35.480 --> 3:11:37.240\n You can go to the library.\n\n3:11:37.240 --> 3:11:40.680\n You don't associate with anyone except your own type.\n\n3:11:40.680 --> 3:11:43.720\n If you do anything like this, we will kill you.\n\n3:11:44.600 --> 3:11:47.560\n If someone wants to extort you,\n\n3:11:47.560 --> 3:11:51.000\n we will do that too and you won't tell on us\n\n3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:52.640\n or we'll kill you.\n\n3:11:52.640 --> 3:11:55.440\n So that's the way that works at that point.\n\n3:11:55.440 --> 3:11:58.080\n And everybody quickly large this.\n\n3:11:58.080 --> 3:11:59.640\n Quickly, quickly.\n\n3:11:59.640 --> 3:12:02.400\n And so typically the guys would say,\n\n3:12:02.400 --> 3:12:03.680\n I just wanna do my own time.\n\n3:12:03.680 --> 3:12:05.080\n That would be the line.\n\n3:12:05.080 --> 3:12:08.400\n And it's like, okay, don't mess with him, all right?\n\n3:12:09.640 --> 3:12:11.720\n Every now and then you'd have somebody lie\n\n3:12:11.720 --> 3:12:14.800\n and that would come with those types of consequences.\n\n3:12:14.800 --> 3:12:19.800\n I got to see, while I was there, saw two people murdered,\n\n3:12:20.840 --> 3:12:23.160\n saw, went through three prison riots\n\n3:12:23.160 --> 3:12:26.960\n and through my entire tenure in prison, saw four suicides.\n\n3:12:26.960 --> 3:12:29.880\n The people who got killed, it was,\n\n3:12:29.880 --> 3:12:32.040\n so we had, outside you had this track,\n\n3:12:32.040 --> 3:12:33.440\n a third of a mile track.\n\n3:12:33.440 --> 3:12:35.760\n You walk it counterclockwise.\n\n3:12:35.760 --> 3:12:38.200\n And inside of the track, you got two handball courts.\n\n3:12:38.200 --> 3:12:42.400\n So of an evening that happened both times,\n\n3:12:42.400 --> 3:12:44.680\n all of us would be walking, doing our exercises.\n\n3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:47.720\n And at the top of the key, like a flock of birds,\n\n3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:51.120\n you'd see all the inmates start to migrate down\n\n3:12:51.120 --> 3:12:52.000\n toward the gate.\n\n3:12:52.920 --> 3:12:55.280\n So the first time you see that, you see that migration,\n\n3:12:55.280 --> 3:12:57.800\n you look up in the distance and one of the inmates\n\n3:12:57.800 --> 3:13:01.680\n got another inmate down and he's just hammering his head\n\n3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:04.040\n right into the pavement, like that right there.\n\n3:13:04.040 --> 3:13:07.480\n Well, guards don't stop that because a guard may get hurt.\n\n3:13:07.480 --> 3:13:11.680\n So a guard is 15 minutes coming out to stop that\n\n3:13:11.680 --> 3:13:12.520\n until everything's over.\n\n3:13:12.520 --> 3:13:15.280\n By that point, the guy doesn't have a head.\n\n3:13:15.280 --> 3:13:17.800\n They shut the compound down and this is what happens.\n\n3:13:17.800 --> 3:13:20.080\n So you shut the entire compound down.\n\n3:13:20.960 --> 3:13:22.800\n They make two lines of the inmates.\n\n3:13:22.800 --> 3:13:25.800\n And what happens is the inmate walks into a room,\n\n3:13:25.800 --> 3:13:27.320\n they shut the door behind the inmate,\n\n3:13:27.320 --> 3:13:28.680\n guard asks them two questions.\n\n3:13:28.680 --> 3:13:30.360\n First question is, did you see anything?\n\n3:13:30.360 --> 3:13:31.640\n The answer is no.\n\n3:13:31.640 --> 3:13:34.200\n Second question is, if you had seen anything,\n\n3:13:34.200 --> 3:13:35.480\n would you say anything?\n\n3:13:35.480 --> 3:13:36.680\n Answer is no.\n\n3:13:36.680 --> 3:13:38.520\n Guard then says, get the fuck out.\n\n3:13:38.520 --> 3:13:40.120\n And that's it.\n\n3:13:40.120 --> 3:13:42.800\n Anybody that stays in any longer than that\n\n3:13:43.960 --> 3:13:45.840\n is automatically suspect.\n\n3:13:45.840 --> 3:13:49.600\n So there was one incident, I remember this Hispanic guy,\n\n3:13:49.600 --> 3:13:51.680\n he's in there for a few minutes.\n\n3:13:51.680 --> 3:13:55.960\n And everybody's like, what's going on?\n\n3:13:55.960 --> 3:13:59.400\n So his people then call him over,\n\n3:13:59.400 --> 3:14:00.960\n explain to us what went on.\n\n3:14:01.800 --> 3:14:03.200\n And it happens like that.\n\n3:14:03.200 --> 3:14:05.080\n It's fascinating because you talked about\n\n3:14:05.080 --> 3:14:10.080\n the network of trust in the cyber crime community.\n\n3:14:10.680 --> 3:14:13.160\n And here's a network of trust\n\n3:14:13.160 --> 3:14:15.000\n in the prison crime community.\n\n3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:17.440\n And trust.\n\n3:14:17.440 --> 3:14:18.960\n Trust matters.\n\n3:14:18.960 --> 3:14:21.080\n Trust drives everything at the end of the day.\n\n3:14:21.080 --> 3:14:23.080\n The riots that I went through,\n\n3:14:23.080 --> 3:14:26.320\n the first riot, man, you're scared to death.\n\n3:14:26.320 --> 3:14:27.520\n Scared to death.\n\n3:14:27.520 --> 3:14:29.400\n You know, you've got the cops dressed up\n\n3:14:29.400 --> 3:14:30.680\n in the Ninja Turtle outfits,\n\n3:14:30.680 --> 3:14:33.000\n you've got the rubber bullets,\n\n3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:35.520\n the tear gas canisters, all that crap.\n\n3:14:35.520 --> 3:14:37.920\n You got the inmates that are raising hell.\n\n3:14:37.920 --> 3:14:39.240\n Scared to death.\n\n3:14:39.240 --> 3:14:42.400\n The second riot, you calm down.\n\n3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:44.680\n Second riot, you start to notice.\n\n3:14:44.680 --> 3:14:46.200\n This is racial riot.\n\n3:14:46.200 --> 3:14:48.680\n This is typically, and almost always,\n\n3:14:48.680 --> 3:14:50.840\n it's Hispanics and African Americans.\n\n3:14:50.840 --> 3:14:53.920\n So you get to detect what is the motivation\n\n3:14:53.920 --> 3:14:55.400\n for the riot, what is the reason,\n\n3:14:55.400 --> 3:14:56.560\n and that gives you some calm.\n\n3:14:56.560 --> 3:14:57.400\n That's exactly right.\n\n3:14:57.400 --> 3:14:58.680\n So the second riot, you start to notice this.\n\n3:14:58.680 --> 3:15:00.840\n Hey, man, this ain't me.\n\n3:15:00.840 --> 3:15:02.640\n This ain't our group.\n\n3:15:02.640 --> 3:15:03.760\n Third riot, no shit.\n\n3:15:03.760 --> 3:15:05.680\n Third riot, you lay in your bunk.\n\n3:15:07.800 --> 3:15:10.680\n You let them wage war all around you,\n\n3:15:10.680 --> 3:15:12.040\n and every now and then you have an inmate\n\n3:15:12.040 --> 3:15:13.640\n that'll run up to you and he'll point to a locker\n\n3:15:13.640 --> 3:15:14.760\n and say, is that your locker?\n\n3:15:14.760 --> 3:15:16.800\n And if you tell him yes, they leave it alone.\n\n3:15:16.800 --> 3:15:17.960\n If you say it's not my locker,\n\n3:15:17.960 --> 3:15:20.080\n they'll break into it and steal everything out of it\n\n3:15:20.080 --> 3:15:23.440\n and go from there, and that's what happens, but.\n\n3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:25.400\n So you did your time for five years.\n\n3:15:25.400 --> 3:15:26.240\n Five and a half.\n\n3:15:26.240 --> 3:15:27.920\n Five and a half.\n\n3:15:27.920 --> 3:15:28.840\n You made it out.\n\n3:15:28.840 --> 3:15:29.680\n Made it out.\n\n3:15:29.680 --> 3:15:32.280\n I went through, I told you it was a good lie that I told.\n\n3:15:32.280 --> 3:15:35.680\n I went through the residential drug abuse program.\n\n3:15:35.680 --> 3:15:37.800\n It's a nine month intensive therapy,\n\n3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:42.120\n and the way I got to that, this counselor at Big Spring,\n\n3:15:42.120 --> 3:15:44.680\n he bought this.\n\n3:15:44.680 --> 3:15:46.800\n He wanted inmates to be educated.\n\n3:15:46.800 --> 3:15:48.240\n He was a really good guy.\n\n3:15:48.240 --> 3:15:49.640\n So he wanted inmates to be educated.\n\n3:15:49.640 --> 3:15:54.640\n He got a discount on a game theory class set.\n\n3:15:55.000 --> 3:15:56.680\n So he gets all these discs and everything,\n\n3:15:56.680 --> 3:15:59.400\n and he's asking, does anybody on the compound\n\n3:15:59.400 --> 3:16:00.960\n know anything about game theory?\n\n3:16:00.960 --> 3:16:04.800\n And somebody says, if anybody does, it'll be Brett Johnson.\n\n3:16:04.800 --> 3:16:07.480\n So he comes up to me one day at my buggy.\n\n3:16:07.480 --> 3:16:09.120\n He's like, are you Brett Johnson?\n\n3:16:09.120 --> 3:16:10.160\n I was like, yeah.\n\n3:16:10.160 --> 3:16:12.640\n He was like, do you know anything about game theory?\n\n3:16:12.640 --> 3:16:15.280\n And I was like, yes, I do.\n\n3:16:15.280 --> 3:16:17.160\n So I start rattling off Prisoner's Dilemma\n\n3:16:17.160 --> 3:16:18.000\n and everything else.\n\n3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:20.120\n He's like, well, you teach a class?\n\n3:16:20.120 --> 3:16:21.160\n So I start teaching that.\n\n3:16:21.160 --> 3:16:23.440\n I start teaching inmates public speaking\n\n3:16:24.480 --> 3:16:26.640\n and to make friends with this counselor.\n\n3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:29.680\n So it gets time where I'm supposed to be transferring out\n\n3:16:29.680 --> 3:16:32.880\n to this drug program that they only had in Fort Worth,\n\n3:16:32.880 --> 3:16:36.440\n and the transfers are taking like four or five months.\n\n3:16:36.440 --> 3:16:39.280\n That's four or five months I could be out free.\n\n3:16:39.280 --> 3:16:41.440\n So I went up to him one day and I was like, look,\n\n3:16:41.440 --> 3:16:42.280\n his name was Keely.\n\n3:16:42.280 --> 3:16:45.360\n I was like, look, man, I said, is there any way\n\n3:16:45.360 --> 3:16:47.080\n that I can get transferred out any sooner?\n\n3:16:47.080 --> 3:16:50.800\n And he looks at me and he's like, Brett, I cannot help you.\n\n3:16:50.800 --> 3:16:52.080\n And I was like, I appreciate that.\n\n3:16:52.080 --> 3:16:53.840\n Thank you so much for even trying.\n\n3:16:53.840 --> 3:16:58.080\n So he said that a week later, I'm on a bus\n\n3:16:58.080 --> 3:16:59.120\n by going to Fort Worth.\n\n3:16:59.120 --> 3:17:00.080\n So he got me to Fort Worth.\n\n3:17:00.080 --> 3:17:00.920\n I got it.\n\n3:17:00.920 --> 3:17:01.760\n Yeah.\n\n3:17:01.760 --> 3:17:02.580\n I love it.\n\n3:17:02.580 --> 3:17:04.240\n So it was a nine month program,\n\n3:17:04.240 --> 3:17:06.720\n 24 hours a day of cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\n3:17:06.720 --> 3:17:07.800\n Had nothing to do with drugs.\n\n3:17:07.800 --> 3:17:12.080\n It was all peer study stuff and CBT training.\n\n3:17:12.080 --> 3:17:15.960\n And honestly, it's the best thing that could ever happen.\n\n3:17:15.960 --> 3:17:16.800\n Truly is.\n\n3:17:16.800 --> 3:17:21.600\n So that part, what was the thing that changed you as a man?\n\n3:17:21.600 --> 3:17:23.520\n Is it the solitary confinement?\n\n3:17:23.520 --> 3:17:24.680\n Was it the years?\n\n3:17:24.680 --> 3:17:28.840\n Was it losing the people you loved?\n\n3:17:28.840 --> 3:17:30.600\n Or was it that behavioral therapy?\n\n3:17:30.600 --> 3:17:31.920\n It's a combination, man.\n\n3:17:31.920 --> 3:17:32.840\n It's a combination.\n\n3:17:32.840 --> 3:17:36.500\n It was, so my sister disowns me.\n\n3:17:36.500 --> 3:17:38.320\n The only person I had in my life.\n\n3:17:38.320 --> 3:17:41.400\n I mean, me and my sister, that's it.\n\n3:17:41.400 --> 3:17:42.920\n I mean, yeah, I loved Elizabeth.\n\n3:17:42.920 --> 3:17:46.440\n I love my wife now, but it's...\n\n3:17:46.440 --> 3:17:49.240\n Me and my sister, we went through all that shit together.\n\n3:17:49.240 --> 3:17:50.320\n So Denise disowns me.\n\n3:17:50.320 --> 3:17:52.920\n She doesn't talk to me for an entire year\n\n3:17:52.920 --> 3:17:54.640\n when all this stuff happens.\n\n3:17:54.640 --> 3:17:58.920\n And after I get arrested on the escape,\n\n3:17:58.920 --> 3:18:01.040\n she ends up driving seven hours\n\n3:18:01.040 --> 3:18:02.520\n to come see me to tell me she loves me.\n\n3:18:02.520 --> 3:18:04.920\n And I don't see her again for five and a half years.\n\n3:18:04.920 --> 3:18:05.760\n Yeah.\n\n3:18:05.760 --> 3:18:07.920\n So that's really the first turnaround.\n\n3:18:07.920 --> 3:18:10.320\n Took me two and a half years in prison\n\n3:18:10.320 --> 3:18:12.720\n to accept responsibility.\n\n3:18:12.720 --> 3:18:14.640\n That was amazing that she did that.\n\n3:18:14.640 --> 3:18:15.480\n Yeah.\n\n3:18:15.480 --> 3:18:16.520\n She's down.\n\n3:18:16.520 --> 3:18:17.360\n Yeah.\n\n3:18:17.360 --> 3:18:18.200\n She did that.\n\n3:18:18.200 --> 3:18:19.020\n Yeah, she's something.\n\n3:18:19.020 --> 3:18:19.860\n She's something.\n\n3:18:19.860 --> 3:18:20.880\n Yeah, she saw me for 10 minutes,\n\n3:18:20.880 --> 3:18:23.320\n tell me she loves me and then I don't see her again.\n\n3:18:23.320 --> 3:18:24.160\n Planted the seed.\n\n3:18:24.160 --> 3:18:24.980\n Yeah.\n\n3:18:24.980 --> 3:18:25.820\n Yeah.\n\n3:18:25.820 --> 3:18:26.660\n So...\n\n3:18:26.660 --> 3:18:29.320\n But yeah, you had time to think over those years.\n\n3:18:29.320 --> 3:18:31.280\n Took two and a half years to realize\n\n3:18:31.280 --> 3:18:32.620\n that I didn't commit crime\n\n3:18:32.620 --> 3:18:35.320\n because of stripper girlfriends or wives or family.\n\n3:18:35.320 --> 3:18:38.180\n I committed it because I wanted to, chose to.\n\n3:18:38.180 --> 3:18:42.080\n And that's the first turnaround.\n\n3:18:42.080 --> 3:18:45.400\n Second turnaround is the CBT training.\n\n3:18:45.400 --> 3:18:50.120\n It didn't really hit while I was in prison.\n\n3:18:50.120 --> 3:18:52.140\n I went through it and they ingrained it in you,\n\n3:18:52.140 --> 3:18:56.720\n but until you choose to make it work, it doesn't work.\n\n3:18:56.720 --> 3:19:00.520\n So I got out in 2011, didn't wanna break the law, did not.\n\n3:19:00.520 --> 3:19:02.920\n And I was under three years probation,\n\n3:19:02.920 --> 3:19:04.620\n couldn't touch a computer.\n\n3:19:04.620 --> 3:19:07.440\n I had a job offer from Deloitte\n\n3:19:07.440 --> 3:19:10.760\n to run a cyber crime office in the UK,\n\n3:19:10.760 --> 3:19:11.840\n which that was a no.\n\n3:19:11.840 --> 3:19:13.880\n Now you're not moving and that's a computer idiot.\n\n3:19:13.880 --> 3:19:18.240\n So then I had a job offer from Know Before,\n\n3:19:18.240 --> 3:19:20.680\n a phishing company, couldn't take that.\n\n3:19:20.680 --> 3:19:24.040\n I got to where I was trying to apply for fast food jobs.\n\n3:19:24.040 --> 3:19:26.440\n That's a computer, can't touch that.\n\n3:19:26.440 --> 3:19:28.780\n Okay, then what about a waiter's position?\n\n3:19:28.780 --> 3:19:31.760\n Well, that's a computer and access to credit cards, idiot.\n\n3:19:31.760 --> 3:19:33.480\n Can't touch that either.\n\n3:19:33.480 --> 3:19:36.500\n So literally could not get a job, could not.\n\n3:19:38.400 --> 3:19:40.040\n Doing food stamps, I had a roommate\n\n3:19:40.040 --> 3:19:42.520\n that paid half the rent.\n\n3:19:42.520 --> 3:19:43.760\n They tell you when you leave prison\n\n3:19:43.760 --> 3:19:46.840\n to get a job in something you care about\n\n3:19:46.840 --> 3:19:48.940\n and you won't recidivate, couldn't get a job.\n\n3:19:48.940 --> 3:19:53.480\n And what I had was a cat, and Monster the Cat,\n\n3:19:53.480 --> 3:19:55.320\n that was the cat's name.\n\n3:19:55.320 --> 3:19:59.600\n And I had enough money to feed that little guy\n\n3:19:59.600 --> 3:20:02.720\n and didn't have money to buy toilet paper for the apartment.\n\n3:20:02.720 --> 3:20:05.400\n So I was on Panama City Beach.\n\n3:20:05.400 --> 3:20:07.360\n How long were you living like this?\n\n3:20:07.360 --> 3:20:08.920\n It was a steady decline,\n\n3:20:08.920 --> 3:20:11.400\n because remember I taught my dad how to commit tax fraud.\n\n3:20:11.400 --> 3:20:14.280\n So he bankrolled a lot of that until he couldn't.\n\n3:20:14.280 --> 3:20:18.160\n And then from there, it's like, what the fuck do you do?\n\n3:20:18.160 --> 3:20:20.800\n So I didn't want to go into computer crime at all.\n\n3:20:20.800 --> 3:20:25.220\n And I ended up shoplifting toilet paper, man.\n\n3:20:25.220 --> 3:20:26.520\n Shoplifting toilet paper.\n\n3:20:26.520 --> 3:20:30.600\n Just like for the basics, the basics of survival.\n\n3:20:30.600 --> 3:20:35.200\n So about the same time I had a friend that, this guy,\n\n3:20:35.200 --> 3:20:37.720\n I'd been dating the same type of women I had been dating,\n\n3:20:37.720 --> 3:20:41.580\n you know, the unhealthy ones, the hot unhealthy ones.\n\n3:20:41.580 --> 3:20:45.000\n Yes, love, that's how that works.\n\n3:20:45.000 --> 3:20:49.000\n So I had a friend post an ad for me on Plenty of Fish.\n\n3:20:49.000 --> 3:20:53.100\n And this woman responds, my wife, she responds.\n\n3:20:53.100 --> 3:20:56.520\n And the pictures I had taken were these prison type pictures,\n\n3:20:56.520 --> 3:20:59.000\n you know, the serious like, they were there.\n\n3:20:59.000 --> 3:21:01.480\n She sends me a message of, why aren't you smiling?\n\n3:21:01.480 --> 3:21:04.240\n And my response was, that is my happy face.\n\n3:21:04.240 --> 3:21:09.320\n So we start talking and we started dating.\n\n3:21:09.320 --> 3:21:13.320\n And she's that second saving thing, man.\n\n3:21:13.320 --> 3:21:14.720\n I ended up moving in with her.\n\n3:21:14.720 --> 3:21:15.720\n I was going broke.\n\n3:21:15.720 --> 3:21:17.300\n I was about to get kicked out of the apartment and everything\n\n3:21:17.300 --> 3:21:17.600\n else.\n\n3:21:17.600 --> 3:21:20.000\n And she didn't say it, but I think she knew it.\n\n3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:26.440\n And moved in with her.\n\n3:21:26.440 --> 3:21:27.880\n And I got a job.\n\n3:21:27.880 --> 3:21:30.040\n And the job I got, my probation officer\n\n3:21:30.040 --> 3:21:31.560\n let me have a cell phone.\n\n3:21:31.560 --> 3:21:32.800\n I was going through Craigslist.\n\n3:21:32.800 --> 3:21:35.040\n This guy was advertising for landscaping.\n\n3:21:35.040 --> 3:21:35.880\n Called him up.\n\n3:21:35.880 --> 3:21:38.060\n His name was Dustin DeRamus.\n\n3:21:38.060 --> 3:21:38.760\n Called him up.\n\n3:21:38.760 --> 3:21:40.000\n And he's like, come on down, talk to me.\n\n3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:42.080\n So he was running this business, him and his brother\n\n3:21:42.080 --> 3:21:43.800\n were, out of his house.\n\n3:21:43.800 --> 3:21:46.240\n So I'm sitting there talking to him for about 20 minutes.\n\n3:21:46.240 --> 3:21:46.800\n He looks at me.\n\n3:21:46.800 --> 3:21:48.340\n He's like, can I ask you a question?\n\n3:21:48.340 --> 3:21:49.360\n I was like, yeah.\n\n3:21:49.360 --> 3:21:51.920\n He's like, are you on the run or something?\n\n3:21:51.920 --> 3:21:53.440\n So I'm like, no, why?\n\n3:21:53.440 --> 3:21:55.240\n And he's like, well, you just don't look\n\n3:21:55.240 --> 3:21:57.980\n like the kind of guy that do this.\n\n3:21:57.980 --> 3:21:59.040\n So I told him.\n\n3:21:59.040 --> 3:21:59.920\n I was like, this is who I am.\n\n3:21:59.920 --> 3:22:01.000\n This is what I've done.\n\n3:22:01.000 --> 3:22:03.320\n And he looks at me.\n\n3:22:03.320 --> 3:22:05.800\n He's like, man, I got to think about that.\n\n3:22:05.800 --> 3:22:08.640\n So he tells me to go on home.\n\n3:22:08.640 --> 3:22:09.800\n That was a Friday.\n\n3:22:09.800 --> 3:22:11.320\n Sunday evening, he gives me a call.\n\n3:22:11.320 --> 3:22:17.820\n And he was like, Brett, if I hire you, will you actually work?\n\n3:22:17.820 --> 3:22:20.000\n And I told him, I was like, Dustin, if you give me a job,\n\n3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:22.440\n I promise I'll work my ass off.\n\n3:22:22.440 --> 3:22:24.120\n And he's like, show up 6 o clock.\n\n3:22:24.120 --> 3:22:25.140\n I was like, all right.\n\n3:22:25.140 --> 3:22:29.000\n So my job was to push a lawnmower 10 hours a day,\n\n3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:33.240\n five days a week for $400 a week, and busted my ass.\n\n3:22:33.240 --> 3:22:40.200\n I hit it so hard, I would come in of a night and pass out,\n\n3:22:40.200 --> 3:22:42.200\n wake up the next morning, and hit it again.\n\n3:22:42.200 --> 3:22:47.560\n And it got to the point, this dude\n\n3:22:47.560 --> 3:22:51.440\n ended up offering me to come in and partner with his business.\n\n3:22:51.440 --> 3:22:52.400\n His brother dropped out.\n\n3:22:52.400 --> 3:22:54.900\n And by that point, I'd learned everything\n\n3:22:54.900 --> 3:22:56.400\n on the business and everything.\n\n3:22:56.400 --> 3:22:58.840\n And he was like, if you'd like to come in,\n\n3:22:58.840 --> 3:22:59.720\n I'll cut you in half.\n\n3:22:59.720 --> 3:23:02.260\n And I was like, Dustin, I can't do it, man.\n\n3:23:02.260 --> 3:23:03.720\n Because I wasn't making any money.\n\n3:23:03.720 --> 3:23:07.480\n He didn't want to pay me anymore until he was able to do more.\n\n3:23:07.480 --> 3:23:12.400\n And I thought I found another job doing something else.\n\n3:23:12.400 --> 3:23:14.600\n And in a speech, I say it got cold and the grass\n\n3:23:14.600 --> 3:23:15.600\n started to stop growing.\n\n3:23:15.600 --> 3:23:18.760\n The truth of the matter was I thought I found another job.\n\n3:23:18.760 --> 3:23:23.400\n Guy was offering to pay me $1,500 a week doing the sales\n\n3:23:23.400 --> 3:23:26.640\n for oil rig training, was what it was.\n\n3:23:26.640 --> 3:23:29.320\n And I accepted the job.\n\n3:23:29.320 --> 3:23:31.920\n I quit working for Dustin.\n\n3:23:31.920 --> 3:23:36.480\n And the guy, I told him before he even offered me a job,\n\n3:23:36.480 --> 3:23:38.400\n I told him my criminal history because I\n\n3:23:38.400 --> 3:23:41.040\n was required to do that.\n\n3:23:41.040 --> 3:23:42.360\n So I was supposed to start work.\n\n3:23:42.360 --> 3:23:44.720\n Well, he calls me and tells me he can't hire me.\n\n3:23:44.720 --> 3:23:46.800\n So I'm out of work.\n\n3:23:46.800 --> 3:23:49.040\n And Dustin's already hired somebody else by that point,\n\n3:23:49.040 --> 3:23:51.680\n so I can't go back with him.\n\n3:23:51.680 --> 3:23:58.840\n And I'm that guy again, man.\n\n3:23:58.840 --> 3:24:05.640\n It's important for me to show value in a relationship.\n\n3:24:05.640 --> 3:24:10.120\n So Michelle was the only one working.\n\n3:24:10.120 --> 3:24:12.280\n I'm like, I got to do something.\n\n3:24:12.280 --> 3:24:14.320\n And I get it in my head.\n\n3:24:14.320 --> 3:24:16.120\n I was like, if nothing else, I can just\n\n3:24:16.120 --> 3:24:17.760\n bring food in the house.\n\n3:24:17.760 --> 3:24:20.320\n She was only making, I think she was, I mean,\n\n3:24:20.320 --> 3:24:23.360\n we had it hard, it was just her working.\n\n3:24:23.360 --> 3:24:27.720\n And I was like, if nothing else, I can bring food in the house\n\n3:24:27.720 --> 3:24:32.520\n and get on the dark web, get some stolen credit cards,\n\n3:24:32.520 --> 3:24:33.600\n start ordering food.\n\n3:24:33.600 --> 3:24:36.440\n Well, it gets worse than that.\n\n3:24:36.440 --> 3:24:38.400\n She's got two sons there.\n\n3:24:38.400 --> 3:24:40.360\n So I'm like, well, they need clothes.\n\n3:24:40.360 --> 3:24:42.760\n So they start stealing clothes.\n\n3:24:42.760 --> 3:24:44.280\n And it continues like that.\n\n3:24:44.280 --> 3:24:45.080\n I get arrested.\n\n3:24:45.080 --> 3:24:48.200\n I get arrested on a food order.\n\n3:24:48.200 --> 3:24:53.200\n And Michelle didn't know what I was doing.\n\n3:24:53.200 --> 3:24:55.960\n So she had been to work, and she was coming back from work.\n\n3:24:55.960 --> 3:24:56.560\n I get arrested.\n\n3:24:56.560 --> 3:24:59.240\n And I'm like, they let me make a phone call.\n\n3:24:59.240 --> 3:25:01.440\n And I call her, and I say, come to the police station.\n\n3:25:01.440 --> 3:25:02.200\n I've been arrested.\n\n3:25:02.200 --> 3:25:04.520\n And she shows up.\n\n3:25:04.520 --> 3:25:06.800\n And she didn't know I'd been doing that.\n\n3:25:06.800 --> 3:25:11.720\n My probation officer, of course, he didn't know anything else.\n\n3:25:11.720 --> 3:25:14.880\n At my sentencing for that, probation officer\n\n3:25:14.880 --> 3:25:19.680\n was there, prosecutor, the judge, US Marshals, Michelle,\n\n3:25:19.680 --> 3:25:21.240\n and me.\n\n3:25:21.240 --> 3:25:23.280\n Michelle stands up, and she tells the judge\n\n3:25:23.280 --> 3:25:25.000\n that I'm a better dad to her kids\n\n3:25:25.000 --> 3:25:26.840\n than their actual father is.\n\n3:25:26.840 --> 3:25:33.400\n And by that point, I'm crying.\n\n3:25:33.400 --> 3:25:35.360\n Probation officer stands up.\n\n3:25:35.360 --> 3:25:39.280\n And he was like, we think Mr. Johnson's a good guy.\n\n3:25:39.280 --> 3:25:40.600\n We think this is a one time thing.\n\n3:25:40.600 --> 3:25:43.680\n Prosecutor says the same thing.\n\n3:25:43.680 --> 3:25:46.880\n Judge sentences me to one year.\n\n3:25:46.880 --> 3:25:49.240\n Probation officer stands back up.\n\n3:25:49.240 --> 3:25:52.800\n And he was like, Mr. Johnson, Judge,\n\n3:25:52.800 --> 3:25:55.600\n if you can give Mr. Johnson a year and a day,\n\n3:25:55.600 --> 3:25:59.440\n he can get the good time and get back to his family sooner.\n\n3:25:59.440 --> 3:26:01.920\n So the judge amends the sentence to a year and a day.\n\n3:26:01.920 --> 3:26:03.040\n So I served 10 months.\n\n3:26:03.040 --> 3:26:04.960\n They sent me back to Texas.\n\n3:26:04.960 --> 3:26:08.480\n And that's when I find out that Michelle didn't need me\n\n3:26:08.480 --> 3:26:10.160\n for what I could give her.\n\n3:26:10.160 --> 3:26:12.040\n She just wanted me for me that entire time.\n\n3:26:12.040 --> 3:26:14.960\n She stands by me the entire time.\n\n3:26:14.960 --> 3:26:16.760\n I do my 10 months, get out.\n\n3:26:16.760 --> 3:26:18.120\n We get married after that.\n\n3:26:18.120 --> 3:26:20.160\n And they kill probation.\n\n3:26:20.160 --> 3:26:21.280\n So I can touch a computer.\n\n3:26:21.280 --> 3:26:23.880\n They tell you, they were like, you know,\n\n3:26:23.880 --> 3:26:28.520\n inmates, a felon, if nothing else, he can sell cars.\n\n3:26:28.520 --> 3:26:30.520\n Well, it turns out you can't.\n\n3:26:30.520 --> 3:26:32.640\n You can sell cars if you're a drug dealer.\n\n3:26:32.640 --> 3:26:34.160\n If you're the guy that steals all the money and people's\n\n3:26:34.160 --> 3:26:35.720\n information, no, fuck no.\n\n3:26:35.720 --> 3:26:37.960\n You can't get a job selling cars.\n\n3:26:37.960 --> 3:26:39.720\n So can't get a job.\n\n3:26:39.720 --> 3:26:40.680\n Cannot.\n\n3:26:40.680 --> 3:26:45.080\n And to this day, Lex, I know what my triggers are.\n\n3:26:45.080 --> 3:26:46.480\n I know what it would take to get me back\n\n3:26:46.480 --> 3:26:48.320\n into committing crime.\n\n3:26:48.320 --> 3:26:50.120\n So, and I knew I'd go so far at that point.\n\n3:26:50.120 --> 3:26:51.240\n So I looked at Michelle and I was like,\n\n3:26:51.240 --> 3:26:53.080\n let me see what I can do.\n\n3:26:53.080 --> 3:26:56.920\n Signed on to LinkedIn, reached out to this FBI super cop\n\n3:26:56.920 --> 3:26:58.960\n named Keith Malarski out of the Pittsburgh office.\n\n3:26:58.960 --> 3:27:02.360\n He was involved with my arrest and some associates\n\n3:27:02.360 --> 3:27:05.240\n and everything else and sent him a message.\n\n3:27:05.240 --> 3:27:06.200\n And the message was, you know,\n\n3:27:06.200 --> 3:27:07.760\n hey, I respect everything you did.\n\n3:27:07.760 --> 3:27:09.720\n Think you did a great job.\n\n3:27:09.720 --> 3:27:12.400\n By the way, I'd like to be legal.\n\n3:27:12.400 --> 3:27:16.240\n And dude responded within two hours.\n\n3:27:16.240 --> 3:27:19.360\n Two hours, he gives me references, advice,\n\n3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:22.160\n takes me in under his wing, everything else like that.\n\n3:27:22.160 --> 3:27:24.200\n And from that point, man, it was the head\n\n3:27:24.200 --> 3:27:26.640\n of the identity theft council did the same thing.\n\n3:27:28.840 --> 3:27:31.480\n Card not present group hires me to speak.\n\n3:27:31.480 --> 3:27:34.400\n Microsoft hires me to consult with them.\n\n3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:37.520\n And the Microsoft hire established enough trust\n\n3:27:37.520 --> 3:27:40.880\n in the industry that I was all right from that point.\n\n3:27:42.400 --> 3:27:45.240\n So now you're helping in many ways,\n\n3:27:45.240 --> 3:27:48.720\n fight the very guy that you used to be.\n\n3:27:48.720 --> 3:27:51.360\n So big picture advice.\n\n3:27:52.280 --> 3:27:55.760\n What, given that you were that guy,\n\n3:27:55.760 --> 3:27:58.160\n how do we fight cyber crime today\n\n3:27:58.160 --> 3:28:01.920\n and in the next five years, 10 years, 20 years, 50 years?\n\n3:28:01.920 --> 3:28:04.240\n What advice do you have to individuals, to companies,\n\n3:28:04.240 --> 3:28:09.240\n to governments of what, and also to Elizabeth,\n\n3:28:13.480 --> 3:28:18.480\n like the humans, human beings that love,\n\n3:28:19.960 --> 3:28:24.040\n that live, that are friends with cyber criminals?\n\n3:28:24.040 --> 3:28:29.040\n There's so many lessons to really be had from that.\n\n3:28:30.520 --> 3:28:33.520\n To me, the lesson, one of the big lessons to me\n\n3:28:33.520 --> 3:28:37.320\n is you can't serve two masters.\n\n3:28:38.720 --> 3:28:41.280\n If you're that guy that is committing crime\n\n3:28:41.280 --> 3:28:43.440\n or that person that's addicted,\n\n3:28:43.440 --> 3:28:48.320\n or you're in love with somebody that's addicted or has that,\n\n3:28:48.320 --> 3:28:49.400\n they don't love you.\n\n3:28:49.400 --> 3:28:51.600\n They love that addiction that comes first.\n\n3:28:51.600 --> 3:28:53.120\n It's always gonna come first.\n\n3:28:53.120 --> 3:28:54.720\n So you have to realize that.\n\n3:28:54.720 --> 3:28:59.720\n You have to know when to cut somebody off,\n\n3:28:59.720 --> 3:29:02.560\n when to end something, that knowing\n\n3:29:02.560 --> 3:29:07.280\n that they're not gonna change until they decide to change.\n\n3:29:07.280 --> 3:29:08.720\n At the same time, you gotta realize\n\n3:29:08.720 --> 3:29:12.200\n that the only reason I was able to turn my life around\n\n3:29:12.200 --> 3:29:14.880\n is because people took that chance on me.\n\n3:29:14.880 --> 3:29:16.680\n That's really the only reason.\n\n3:29:16.680 --> 3:29:18.480\n They believe that there's a good person in there.\n\n3:29:18.480 --> 3:29:21.600\n Yeah, if Malarski hadn't responded,\n\n3:29:21.600 --> 3:29:23.720\n if I hadn't had my sister, my wife,\n\n3:29:23.720 --> 3:29:26.440\n these companies that initially gave me that chance,\n\n3:29:26.440 --> 3:29:28.960\n my ass would be back in prison for 20 years.\n\n3:29:28.960 --> 3:29:31.720\n I have no doubt about that at all, all right?\n\n3:29:31.720 --> 3:29:33.720\n So you have to realize that.\n\n3:29:34.600 --> 3:29:37.560\n Cybercrime, a lot of companies that I talk to,\n\n3:29:37.560 --> 3:29:39.760\n they don't really understand or appreciate\n\n3:29:41.160 --> 3:29:44.760\n that networking aspect, that trust aspect\n\n3:29:44.760 --> 3:29:47.120\n of how criminals establish trust with each other,\n\n3:29:47.120 --> 3:29:48.200\n how they work together.\n\n3:29:48.200 --> 3:29:51.040\n A lot of companies think that it's a single player\n\n3:29:51.040 --> 3:29:52.280\n that's out victimizing them.\n\n3:29:52.280 --> 3:29:55.080\n And when you really break down how cybercrime operates,\n\n3:29:55.080 --> 3:29:57.360\n that you've got a group of individuals\n\n3:29:57.360 --> 3:29:59.280\n that are working together to hit you,\n\n3:29:59.280 --> 3:30:00.120\n but not only hit you,\n\n3:30:00.120 --> 3:30:03.000\n but they share and exchange information freely.\n\n3:30:03.000 --> 3:30:04.240\n Companies don't do that.\n\n3:30:04.240 --> 3:30:05.280\n You've got privacy concerns,\n\n3:30:05.280 --> 3:30:07.480\n you've got competitive edge concerns, everything else.\n\n3:30:07.480 --> 3:30:09.640\n Companies don't share information across the board\n\n3:30:09.640 --> 3:30:11.040\n like criminals do.\n\n3:30:11.040 --> 3:30:12.080\n Criminals do that.\n\n3:30:13.040 --> 3:30:13.880\n You have to appreciate that.\n\n3:30:13.880 --> 3:30:17.000\n You have to understand that big statistic\n\n3:30:17.000 --> 3:30:19.520\n that 90% of your tax use known exploits.\n\n3:30:19.520 --> 3:30:20.840\n It's not the stuff we don't know about,\n\n3:30:20.840 --> 3:30:22.680\n it's the shit we do know about.\n\n3:30:22.680 --> 3:30:24.040\n We're not doing anything about.\n\n3:30:24.040 --> 3:30:26.040\n So the way to defend against cybercrime\n\n3:30:26.040 --> 3:30:29.520\n is like there's a lot of low hanging fruit\n\n3:30:29.520 --> 3:30:30.360\n that you should fix.\n\n3:30:30.360 --> 3:30:31.280\n A lot of that.\n\n3:30:31.280 --> 3:30:32.120\n A lot of that.\n\n3:30:32.120 --> 3:30:33.200\n Sort of a lot of basic stuff\n\n3:30:33.200 --> 3:30:34.440\n that's already vulnerabilities,\n\n3:30:34.440 --> 3:30:35.880\n update the system security.\n\n3:30:35.880 --> 3:30:39.280\n Now that doesn't take care of SolarWinds or CNAP\n\n3:30:39.280 --> 3:30:40.360\n or anything like that.\n\n3:30:40.360 --> 3:30:41.680\n It doesn't.\n\n3:30:41.680 --> 3:30:45.600\n But those instances, I mean, okay, that's a big instance.\n\n3:30:46.600 --> 3:30:47.440\n I mean, it is.\n\n3:30:47.440 --> 3:30:52.160\n But in the full spectrum of, especially in the future,\n\n3:30:52.160 --> 3:30:56.400\n because there's more and more companies\n\n3:30:56.400 --> 3:30:58.880\n that are coming online, they're becoming digital.\n\n3:30:58.880 --> 3:31:01.440\n And it's just more and more and more.\n\n3:31:01.440 --> 3:31:03.720\n And those vulnerabilities in terms of human nature,\n\n3:31:03.720 --> 3:31:07.680\n so for social engineering and the actual outdated systems,\n\n3:31:07.680 --> 3:31:08.520\n all of it.\n\n3:31:08.520 --> 3:31:11.760\n Some of it, I guess is, I mean, you're exceptionally good\n\n3:31:11.760 --> 3:31:14.480\n at this is educating on the social engineering side,\n\n3:31:14.480 --> 3:31:16.520\n is educating people in companies that like.\n\n3:31:16.520 --> 3:31:18.120\n You've got to do that.\n\n3:31:18.120 --> 3:31:20.520\n And companies have to, you know, I made that point\n\n3:31:20.520 --> 3:31:23.320\n that they never report to law enforcement.\n\n3:31:23.320 --> 3:31:25.160\n That's companies and individuals.\n\n3:31:25.160 --> 3:31:27.560\n You know, I've worked with Fortune 50 companies\n\n3:31:27.560 --> 3:31:30.960\n that will not press charges.\n\n3:31:30.960 --> 3:31:34.440\n Instead, they'll have that insider or that criminal\n\n3:31:34.440 --> 3:31:36.880\n sign an NDA, they'll pay them off.\n\n3:31:36.880 --> 3:31:39.440\n And we won't mention this shit anymore.\n\n3:31:39.440 --> 3:31:41.360\n You have to be, you have to press charges.\n\n3:31:41.360 --> 3:31:43.600\n You have to report, you have to raise the awareness\n\n3:31:43.600 --> 3:31:45.600\n of everyone in the group.\n\n3:31:45.600 --> 3:31:47.800\n You have to be, it's that idea.\n\n3:31:47.800 --> 3:31:49.040\n And I've talked about that before\n\n3:31:49.040 --> 3:31:52.760\n of understanding your place in that cyber crime spectrum.\n\n3:31:52.760 --> 3:31:54.680\n The way a criminal will victimize you\n\n3:31:55.640 --> 3:31:57.360\n depends on who you are and what you do\n\n3:31:57.360 --> 3:31:59.840\n as a person and as a business.\n\n3:31:59.840 --> 3:32:02.240\n So you have to understand that, design security around that.\n\n3:32:02.240 --> 3:32:05.240\n You know, we've got 7,500 security companies out there.\n\n3:32:05.240 --> 3:32:07.680\n A whole lot of them are snake oil salesmen.\n\n3:32:07.680 --> 3:32:09.080\n A lot of them is going to tell you that\n\n3:32:09.080 --> 3:32:13.400\n we're the one stop solution, but you're not, you're not.\n\n3:32:13.400 --> 3:32:15.320\n You're a tool, all right?\n\n3:32:15.320 --> 3:32:17.400\n And you may have a very good tool,\n\n3:32:17.400 --> 3:32:19.960\n but it's not the only tool that's needed\n\n3:32:19.960 --> 3:32:22.400\n to protect against the attacks that are out there.\n\n3:32:22.400 --> 3:32:24.040\n And we have to be open and honest\n\n3:32:24.040 --> 3:32:25.560\n about that kind of stuff if we're not.\n\n3:32:25.560 --> 3:32:29.800\n So I guess defending defense is not just like one tool.\n\n3:32:29.800 --> 3:32:33.400\n It's a process of just like a diversity\n\n3:32:33.400 --> 3:32:36.080\n and just constantly educating people.\n\n3:32:36.080 --> 3:32:36.920\n Absolutely.\n\n3:32:36.920 --> 3:32:40.200\n So it's the social side, it's constantly,\n\n3:32:40.200 --> 3:32:42.360\n because there's so many probably attack vectors\n\n3:32:42.360 --> 3:32:43.880\n in terms of the software that you have.\n\n3:32:43.880 --> 3:32:45.900\n If you look at it, that attack surface,\n\n3:32:45.900 --> 3:32:47.480\n you can't plug everything.\n\n3:32:47.480 --> 3:32:50.160\n It's too damn large to plug everything.\n\n3:32:50.160 --> 3:32:52.320\n But you can do the best job you can possibly do,\n\n3:32:52.320 --> 3:32:55.760\n but it takes a variety of tools to do that, all right?\n\n3:32:55.760 --> 3:32:59.200\n The idea, and Arcos is big about that,\n\n3:32:59.200 --> 3:33:04.080\n but the idea is to take the cost of fraud\n\n3:33:04.080 --> 3:33:06.780\n to the fraudster so high that they basically\n\n3:33:06.780 --> 3:33:08.640\n try to pick another target, all right?\n\n3:33:08.640 --> 3:33:09.820\n And that's the idea that you want.\n\n3:33:09.820 --> 3:33:12.920\n You want it to be not worth the criminal's time\n\n3:33:12.920 --> 3:33:14.800\n to hit your company.\n\n3:33:14.800 --> 3:33:16.840\n What about white hat hacking?\n\n3:33:16.840 --> 3:33:20.600\n So like hacking for good,\n\n3:33:21.720 --> 3:33:24.840\n sort of testing systems and then giving companies\n\n3:33:24.840 --> 3:33:27.040\n the vulnerabilities as you find them?\n\n3:33:27.040 --> 3:33:28.320\n I think it's outstanding.\n\n3:33:28.320 --> 3:33:29.960\n I do, I think that, I think pen testing,\n\n3:33:29.960 --> 3:33:31.480\n white hat stuff is outstanding.\n\n3:33:31.480 --> 3:33:32.420\n I truly do.\n\n3:33:32.420 --> 3:33:34.760\n I think that you have to.\n\n3:33:36.160 --> 3:33:40.860\n It has to be tempered with what is reality as well though.\n\n3:33:40.860 --> 3:33:43.160\n All right, we've got a whole industry of people\n\n3:33:43.160 --> 3:33:45.680\n who try to sell RFID wallets,\n\n3:33:45.680 --> 3:33:48.480\n that I don't know of many RFID hackers out there\n\n3:33:48.480 --> 3:33:50.760\n on the criminal side, to be honest with you.\n\n3:33:50.760 --> 3:33:52.920\n Yeah, so some of it is just like a psychological\n\n3:33:52.920 --> 3:33:57.920\n safety blanket that's not actually providing any protection.\n\n3:33:58.240 --> 3:34:02.080\n By the way, you wrote on LinkedIn something about ID me.\n\n3:34:04.520 --> 3:34:05.720\n What is it?\n\n3:34:05.720 --> 3:34:07.160\n Why is it a problem?\n\n3:34:07.160 --> 3:34:08.760\n I was going down a rabbit hole with you.\n\n3:34:08.760 --> 3:34:10.800\n I was wondering if you were gonna mention that.\n\n3:34:10.800 --> 3:34:14.040\n You know, they lost, I guess I was partially responsible\n\n3:34:14.040 --> 3:34:16.480\n for them losing an $86 million contract.\n\n3:34:17.480 --> 3:34:19.080\n What was the contract with the government?\n\n3:34:19.080 --> 3:34:19.920\n With the IRS.\n\n3:34:19.920 --> 3:34:21.300\n Just with the IRS.\n\n3:34:21.300 --> 3:34:22.320\n So what is it?\n\n3:34:22.320 --> 3:34:25.840\n So ID me is an identity, okay, backtrack.\n\n3:34:25.840 --> 3:34:28.880\n ID me is a marketing company that wants to say\n\n3:34:28.880 --> 3:34:30.440\n they're an identity verification company.\n\n3:34:30.440 --> 3:34:32.600\n I just wanna bring this up to see you get angry.\n\n3:34:32.600 --> 3:34:33.440\n Okay.\n\n3:34:35.280 --> 3:34:36.880\n I'll tell you what my issue is.\n\n3:34:36.880 --> 3:34:37.920\n My issue is.\n\n3:34:37.920 --> 3:34:42.240\n So it's a company that's used for authentication\n\n3:34:42.240 --> 3:34:43.600\n by the IRS, I guess.\n\n3:34:43.600 --> 3:34:45.960\n IRS, Social Security Administration, VA,\n\n3:34:47.080 --> 3:34:51.760\n at 1.23 state unemployment offices, few other services.\n\n3:34:51.760 --> 3:34:54.660\n So I guess the idea is that you would be able\n\n3:34:54.660 --> 3:34:59.660\n to unlock your account or authenticate yourself\n\n3:35:00.220 --> 3:35:04.880\n as a human being by using your face or something like that.\n\n3:35:04.880 --> 3:35:06.680\n Or private information.\n\n3:35:06.680 --> 3:35:08.880\n They've got a tiered system with verification.\n\n3:35:08.880 --> 3:35:12.040\n They've got, you can do, they've got a free system\n\n3:35:12.040 --> 3:35:14.920\n which is questionable where you submit an ID\n\n3:35:14.920 --> 3:35:17.840\n and it's been shown, several bypasses have been shown.\n\n3:35:17.840 --> 3:35:20.080\n And I don't wanna talk about their security horribly bad\n\n3:35:20.080 --> 3:35:22.880\n because I wanna be honest, there are bypasses\n\n3:35:22.880 --> 3:35:24.920\n for a lot of security systems out there.\n\n3:35:24.920 --> 3:35:26.400\n All right?\n\n3:35:26.400 --> 3:35:30.760\n The issue that I have with ID me is that\n\n3:35:30.760 --> 3:35:34.760\n their policies are somewhat questionable.\n\n3:35:34.760 --> 3:35:36.100\n I don't care if you're a private company\n\n3:35:36.100 --> 3:35:37.520\n that has those policies in place.\n\n3:35:37.520 --> 3:35:40.760\n But if you're a government agency\n\n3:35:40.760 --> 3:35:43.760\n and you as a citizen are entitled to a benefit\n\n3:35:43.760 --> 3:35:46.680\n or a service of that government agency,\n\n3:35:46.680 --> 3:35:49.400\n and then the government agency forces you\n\n3:35:49.400 --> 3:35:52.400\n to give up your complete identity profile\n\n3:35:52.400 --> 3:35:53.480\n to a private company.\n\n3:35:53.480 --> 3:35:55.480\n And then that private company uses that profile\n\n3:35:55.480 --> 3:35:59.440\n for marketing purposes, to further profit, things like that.\n\n3:35:59.440 --> 3:36:01.760\n I have a huge issue with that.\n\n3:36:01.760 --> 3:36:03.880\n I don't care if you're a private company that does that.\n\n3:36:03.880 --> 3:36:05.840\n I just don't think that citizens need to be forced\n\n3:36:05.840 --> 3:36:07.920\n into doing that in order to get a benefit\n\n3:36:07.920 --> 3:36:09.960\n or service that they're entitled to.\n\n3:36:09.960 --> 3:36:11.760\n So that's my big issue.\n\n3:36:11.760 --> 3:36:14.840\n So that, I mean, given how much value,\n\n3:36:14.840 --> 3:36:17.440\n how much we talked about the value of identity,\n\n3:36:17.440 --> 3:36:19.720\n you don't think that should be handed over lightly?\n\n3:36:19.720 --> 3:36:21.600\n No, absolutely not.\n\n3:36:21.600 --> 3:36:23.000\n And who would have thought that Brett Johnson\n\n3:36:23.000 --> 3:36:25.000\n would ever become a privacy advocate?\n\n3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:29.040\n But here I am.\n\n3:36:29.040 --> 3:36:33.240\n I mean, it's just, people don't understand\n\n3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:37.880\n or appreciate the value of who they are.\n\n3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:41.300\n And certainly you've got a host of companies,\n\n3:36:41.300 --> 3:36:42.360\n ID means not the only one,\n\n3:36:42.360 --> 3:36:44.080\n but you've got some of these companies that say,\n\n3:36:44.080 --> 3:36:48.120\n well, we strip out the PII of the individual.\n\n3:36:48.120 --> 3:36:49.360\n We're just using the biometrics\n\n3:36:49.360 --> 3:36:51.560\n and the sites they're visiting and things like that.\n\n3:36:51.560 --> 3:36:53.120\n That's identity.\n\n3:36:53.120 --> 3:36:55.640\n You can still ping that one unique individual\n\n3:36:55.640 --> 3:36:57.160\n out of all, using that information.\n\n3:36:57.160 --> 3:36:58.680\n Stripping out the PII,\n\n3:36:58.680 --> 3:37:00.880\n you can still ping who that individual is.\n\n3:37:00.880 --> 3:37:05.040\n So having lived a life of crime for many years,\n\n3:37:05.040 --> 3:37:08.220\n I'm sure you've connected indirectly\n\n3:37:08.220 --> 3:37:11.600\n to a large number of very dangerous people.\n\n3:37:11.600 --> 3:37:12.760\n Directly and directly.\n\n3:37:12.760 --> 3:37:14.160\n Yeah.\n\n3:37:14.160 --> 3:37:17.680\n But the network indirectly is even larger, right?\n\n3:37:17.680 --> 3:37:18.520\n Oh yeah, oh yeah.\n\n3:37:18.520 --> 3:37:20.940\n Are you, and I apologize for this question,\n\n3:37:22.800 --> 3:37:27.000\n are you ever worried for your life, for your wellbeing?\n\n3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:30.320\n Like having seen a world that's really dangerous\n\n3:37:30.320 --> 3:37:35.080\n in ways that's not, that operates in the shadows.\n\n3:37:38.600 --> 3:37:41.320\n Like I said, when we started Shadow Crew\n\n3:37:41.320 --> 3:37:44.320\n and started that initial cybercrime business, that world,\n\n3:37:46.480 --> 3:37:47.800\n violence wasn't there.\n\n3:37:47.800 --> 3:37:49.000\n It came in later.\n\n3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:51.560\n Now violence is inherent in the system,\n\n3:37:51.560 --> 3:37:52.880\n to do the Monty Python bit.\n\n3:37:52.880 --> 3:37:54.460\n It's part of it.\n\n3:37:55.920 --> 3:37:58.800\n Yeah, the mob, the mafia are now part of this whole thing.\n\n3:37:58.800 --> 3:38:00.000\n Cartels are part of it.\n\n3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:00.840\n Yeah.\n\n3:38:00.840 --> 3:38:05.120\n Drugs are inherently intertwined in cybercrime marketplaces\n\n3:38:05.120 --> 3:38:06.600\n because of the profit potential.\n\n3:38:06.600 --> 3:38:08.840\n And with that comes a lot of violence as well.\n\n3:38:08.840 --> 3:38:12.080\n Yeah, the cartels already brought the violence\n\n3:38:12.080 --> 3:38:14.120\n that they're good at from the 20th century.\n\n3:38:14.120 --> 3:38:14.960\n Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n3:38:14.960 --> 3:38:16.640\n Into the technology of the 21st century.\n\n3:38:16.640 --> 3:38:20.160\n Now, do I worry about that?\n\n3:38:20.160 --> 3:38:24.280\n It's interesting that my family worries about that.\n\n3:38:25.720 --> 3:38:26.560\n All right.\n\n3:38:26.560 --> 3:38:28.480\n I think I may be just too involved in it\n\n3:38:28.480 --> 3:38:32.280\n to appreciate that type of danger.\n\n3:38:32.280 --> 3:38:35.000\n But my family worries about that.\n\n3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:36.040\n They do.\n\n3:38:36.040 --> 3:38:37.540\n Do I think it's a possibility?\n\n3:38:38.580 --> 3:38:41.200\n I'm the guy that says what needs to be said.\n\n3:38:41.200 --> 3:38:45.320\n I've built my trust in this industry\n\n3:38:45.320 --> 3:38:50.320\n by not being scared of calling out companies and individuals\n\n3:38:51.600 --> 3:38:53.720\n and not being scared of targeting criminals\n\n3:38:53.720 --> 3:38:54.840\n or criminal groups.\n\n3:38:54.840 --> 3:38:59.840\n Your honesty as a human being emotionally\n\n3:39:00.560 --> 3:39:03.320\n and intellectually is really refreshing.\n\n3:39:03.320 --> 3:39:05.040\n It's a gift and thank you.\n\n3:39:05.040 --> 3:39:06.640\n Thank you for doing that.\n\n3:39:06.640 --> 3:39:11.640\n Is there a device you can give to young people today\n\n3:39:11.640 --> 3:39:13.360\n about life?\n\n3:39:13.360 --> 3:39:18.360\n You broke many rules, all the rules.\n\n3:39:19.140 --> 3:39:21.640\n Some rules should be broken.\n\n3:39:21.640 --> 3:39:23.200\n So if you look at somebody young today\n\n3:39:23.200 --> 3:39:24.960\n in high school and college,\n\n3:39:24.960 --> 3:39:29.960\n thinking how they can break the rules legally\n\n3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:34.040\n and live a life that's something they could be really proud\n\n3:39:34.040 --> 3:39:35.840\n of, what would you say?\n\n3:39:35.840 --> 3:39:37.240\n Biggest lesson I've learned.\n\n3:39:39.280 --> 3:39:43.560\n You want your life to be one where you're helping people\n\n3:39:43.560 --> 3:39:45.440\n and not hurting people.\n\n3:39:45.440 --> 3:39:49.920\n And that really hit me the first time I walked into Quantico.\n\n3:39:49.920 --> 3:39:54.440\n You see the brightest minds in the United States\n\n3:39:54.440 --> 3:39:57.040\n who give up a lot of money,\n\n3:39:57.040 --> 3:39:58.680\n the opportunities of a lot of money\n\n3:39:58.680 --> 3:40:01.920\n because they believe in helping people.\n\n3:40:01.920 --> 3:40:05.260\n Where I spent a career just hurting and harming individuals,\n\n3:40:05.260 --> 3:40:07.860\n that's a hell of a lesson.\n\n3:40:07.860 --> 3:40:09.800\n And I'm glad I'm there,\n\n3:40:09.800 --> 3:40:12.160\n but I would tell people out there,\n\n3:40:12.160 --> 3:40:13.780\n it's fine to want money.\n\n3:40:13.780 --> 3:40:14.620\n It's fine to do that.\n\n3:40:14.620 --> 3:40:16.400\n It's fine to test systems.\n\n3:40:16.400 --> 3:40:18.240\n It's fine to circumvent the rules\n\n3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:19.440\n if you're not breaking the law.\n\n3:40:19.440 --> 3:40:20.280\n It's fine to do all that.\n\n3:40:20.280 --> 3:40:22.040\n I like doing that, all right?\n\n3:40:22.040 --> 3:40:23.560\n But if you've got the mindset,\n\n3:40:23.560 --> 3:40:26.560\n if you can just adhere to the mindset of helping people\n\n3:40:26.560 --> 3:40:28.320\n and not hurting people,\n\n3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:31.200\n I think you'll be all right at the end of the day.\n\n3:40:31.200 --> 3:40:35.120\n What gives you, again, given the dark web,\n\n3:40:35.120 --> 3:40:37.320\n given all the dangers out there,\n\n3:40:37.320 --> 3:40:39.840\n what gives you hope about the future,\n\n3:40:39.840 --> 3:40:43.080\n looking into five, 10 years, 50 years?\n\n3:40:43.080 --> 3:40:45.480\n I mean, hope for human civilization.\n\n3:40:45.480 --> 3:40:50.480\n If we do all right, if we make it out of this century,\n\n3:40:53.660 --> 3:40:55.560\n what do you think would be the reason?\n\n3:40:57.920 --> 3:40:59.160\n That's a damn good question.\n\n3:40:59.160 --> 3:41:01.360\n Because I mean, we've got a lot of bad stuff going on.\n\n3:41:01.360 --> 3:41:03.280\n We've got a lot of reasons.\n\n3:41:03.280 --> 3:41:05.840\n If I asked you the other question of\n\n3:41:05.840 --> 3:41:08.280\n how do you think human civilization would destroy itself,\n\n3:41:08.280 --> 3:41:10.680\n I'm sure you have a lot of answers.\n\n3:41:10.680 --> 3:41:12.520\n You know what gives me hope is\n\n3:41:12.520 --> 3:41:16.960\n that you see people working together.\n\n3:41:16.960 --> 3:41:19.200\n The COVIDs have been a little bit different\n\n3:41:19.200 --> 3:41:20.520\n because I think too many people\n\n3:41:20.520 --> 3:41:22.240\n wanted to play politics with it.\n\n3:41:22.240 --> 3:41:24.000\n That's been the heartbreaking thing about COVID\n\n3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:26.920\n is it's in many ways pulled people apart.\n\n3:41:26.920 --> 3:41:29.760\n I mean, because a virus involves\n\n3:41:29.760 --> 3:41:33.840\n kind of being afraid of each other\n\n3:41:33.840 --> 3:41:35.780\n because I mean, that was a scary thing.\n\n3:41:35.780 --> 3:41:38.240\n People talk about pandemics in that way\n\n3:41:38.240 --> 3:41:40.120\n that you're afraid of other humans.\n\n3:41:40.120 --> 3:41:41.660\n That is the most terrifying thing.\n\n3:41:41.660 --> 3:41:44.480\n It's not the destructive nature of what it does to your body.\n\n3:41:44.480 --> 3:41:46.760\n It's just that it pulls people apart.\n\n3:41:46.760 --> 3:41:49.280\n And then you realize how fundamental\n\n3:41:49.280 --> 3:41:51.240\n that human connection is to human civilization.\n\n3:41:51.240 --> 3:41:53.080\n Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n3:41:53.080 --> 3:41:55.460\n But you know, as human beings,\n\n3:41:55.460 --> 3:41:59.440\n we do, when things really get bad,\n\n3:41:59.440 --> 3:42:00.500\n when things really get bad,\n\n3:42:00.500 --> 3:42:03.680\n we do tend to respond and group together.\n\n3:42:03.680 --> 3:42:04.520\n We do that.\n\n3:42:04.520 --> 3:42:09.520\n When there's injustice, we see it, we rise up.\n\n3:42:09.520 --> 3:42:14.520\n I wake up every morning and I watch Fox News and CNN\n\n3:42:15.440 --> 3:42:17.520\n so I can be pissed off at everyone.\n\n3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:21.440\n All right, so the division, the outrage,\n\n3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:22.600\n they're really feeding.\n\n3:42:22.600 --> 3:42:25.120\n They want you, they want you to be angry.\n\n3:42:25.120 --> 3:42:27.880\n Yeah, that's what causes me to spare\n\n3:42:27.880 --> 3:42:30.720\n and what I think that, you know, we just need to.\n\n3:42:30.720 --> 3:42:32.640\n Elizabeth was very good.\n\n3:42:32.640 --> 3:42:34.000\n She taught me one hell of a lesson\n\n3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:37.440\n because before I met her, I was a news hound.\n\n3:42:37.440 --> 3:42:38.840\n News would be on all the time.\n\n3:42:38.840 --> 3:42:40.120\n A couple of channels of it.\n\n3:42:40.120 --> 3:42:45.120\n And she was the woman who didn't watch the news at all.\n\n3:42:45.620 --> 3:42:48.360\n And I didn't understand that back then, man.\n\n3:42:48.360 --> 3:42:49.520\n But now I do.\n\n3:42:49.520 --> 3:42:52.480\n You know, now I'm like, it's pretty smart, you know?\n\n3:42:52.480 --> 3:42:55.560\n Don't need to listen to that bullshit as it is.\n\n3:42:55.560 --> 3:42:58.200\n That's why I love reading history books.\n\n3:42:59.280 --> 3:43:03.920\n I just, I feel like that's the right perspective\n\n3:43:03.920 --> 3:43:05.600\n on take on modern times.\n\n3:43:05.600 --> 3:43:07.600\n You know, how will this time be written about\n\n3:43:07.600 --> 3:43:10.440\n in the history books and react to that?\n\n3:43:10.440 --> 3:43:15.440\n Don't the daily ups and downs of the outrages,\n\n3:43:15.640 --> 3:43:17.280\n which is getting worse and worse\n\n3:43:17.280 --> 3:43:19.440\n in terms of how quick the turnaround is\n\n3:43:19.440 --> 3:43:20.800\n in terms of the news.\n\n3:43:20.800 --> 3:43:22.920\n I'll tell you what, I'm sitting here.\n\n3:43:22.920 --> 3:43:24.840\n I appreciate you talking to me.\n\n3:43:24.840 --> 3:43:28.440\n I do, because, you know, I talk about that relationship\n\n3:43:28.440 --> 3:43:29.280\n and everything.\n\n3:43:29.280 --> 3:43:32.080\n It's really been this kind of realization\n\n3:43:32.080 --> 3:43:33.000\n for me on a lot of things.\n\n3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:34.960\n So I really appreciate you asking those questions\n\n3:43:34.960 --> 3:43:36.760\n and everything, maybe be able to talk about that.\n\n3:43:36.760 --> 3:43:41.760\n I love it that you value, first of all,\n\n3:43:41.920 --> 3:43:43.720\n you're self aware how important love\n\n3:43:43.720 --> 3:43:45.240\n is in a human being's life.\n\n3:43:46.640 --> 3:43:48.200\n It can make you do some of the best\n\n3:43:48.200 --> 3:43:50.240\n and some of the worst things in this world.\n\n3:43:50.240 --> 3:43:51.640\n And it's good to think about that.\n\n3:43:51.640 --> 3:43:53.240\n It's good to think about that.\n\n3:43:53.240 --> 3:43:55.280\n That is what makes us human, is that connection\n\n3:43:55.280 --> 3:43:56.720\n and that love for each other.\n\n3:44:00.120 --> 3:44:01.880\n What do you think is the meaning of life?\n\n3:44:01.880 --> 3:44:03.240\n This big, ridiculous question.\n\n3:44:03.240 --> 3:44:05.240\n Why the hell, what are we all here for?\n\n3:44:05.240 --> 3:44:07.720\n I don't think it is ridiculous, man.\n\n3:44:07.720 --> 3:44:09.760\n To me, that meaning of life is finding out\n\n3:44:09.760 --> 3:44:13.440\n that lesson that we need to help each other.\n\n3:44:13.440 --> 3:44:15.160\n If you talk, you ask about security,\n\n3:44:15.160 --> 3:44:16.000\n how do you get to say that?\n\n3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:18.520\n But, you know, everybody's worried about themselves.\n\n3:44:19.520 --> 3:44:21.840\n The way you solve that security problem\n\n3:44:21.840 --> 3:44:26.440\n is it takes everybody looking out for everyone else.\n\n3:44:26.440 --> 3:44:29.440\n That's how you solve that problem.\n\n3:44:29.440 --> 3:44:32.400\n And however you take, whatever journey you take\n\n3:44:32.400 --> 3:44:34.000\n to discovering that point.\n\n3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:37.680\n Yeah, I mean, with me, I've been asked a few times,\n\n3:44:37.680 --> 3:44:38.520\n do you regret anything?\n\n3:44:38.520 --> 3:44:40.000\n Would you change anything?\n\n3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:45.000\n I've done a shitload of despicable things in my life.\n\n3:44:46.480 --> 3:44:50.240\n But I'm at a point in my life where I like who I am.\n\n3:44:50.240 --> 3:44:51.960\n And I know that I am doing exactly\n\n3:44:51.960 --> 3:44:53.680\n what I'm supposed to be doing with my life.\n\n3:44:53.680 --> 3:44:55.600\n So, would I change anything?\n\n3:44:55.600 --> 3:44:59.440\n As bad as a lot of that shit has been, I wouldn't.\n\n3:44:59.440 --> 3:45:00.880\n It made you who you are.\n\n3:45:00.880 --> 3:45:01.960\n Yeah.\n\n3:45:01.960 --> 3:45:03.240\n The whole of it, the whole mess.\n\n3:45:03.240 --> 3:45:05.640\n That's trite to say that, but it's true.\n\n3:45:05.640 --> 3:45:07.360\n That's the weird thing, it's true.\n\n3:45:09.160 --> 3:45:10.000\n Yeah.\n\n3:45:10.000 --> 3:45:13.640\n Also, you mentioned that you're thinking of launching a show.\n\n3:45:13.640 --> 3:45:14.520\n What's it gonna be called?\n\n3:45:14.520 --> 3:45:16.440\n Cause you've done a couple of podcasts.\n\n3:45:16.440 --> 3:45:17.840\n You're incredibly good at this.\n\n3:45:17.840 --> 3:45:18.960\n You're so good at this.\n\n3:45:18.960 --> 3:45:19.800\n I've done a couple.\n\n3:45:19.800 --> 3:45:22.480\n I'm on a lot of podcasts and everything like that.\n\n3:45:22.480 --> 3:45:25.880\n I had the fraud cast with a friend of mine,\n\n3:45:25.880 --> 3:45:26.720\n Carice Hendrick.\n\n3:45:26.720 --> 3:45:29.240\n And that ended because of a difference of opinion.\n\n3:45:29.240 --> 3:45:34.240\n Depending on who you ask, one of us was an asshole.\n\n3:45:34.320 --> 3:45:35.160\n Yes.\n\n3:45:35.160 --> 3:45:36.000\n And it may have been me.\n\n3:45:36.000 --> 3:45:36.840\n Yeah.\n\n3:45:36.840 --> 3:45:38.520\n But then I did the Anglerfish podcast,\n\n3:45:38.520 --> 3:45:40.160\n which that was, I gotta be honest with you, Lex,\n\n3:45:40.160 --> 3:45:41.920\n it was completely directionless.\n\n3:45:41.920 --> 3:45:43.960\n And it was Brett Johnson getting lazy.\n\n3:45:43.960 --> 3:45:45.000\n Yeah.\n\n3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:46.840\n So I ended that.\n\n3:45:46.840 --> 3:45:50.080\n The Brett Johnson show is launching.\n\n3:45:50.080 --> 3:45:50.920\n That's the new one.\n\n3:45:50.920 --> 3:45:51.760\n That's the new one.\n\n3:45:51.760 --> 3:45:52.600\n That's what the new one's called.\n\n3:45:52.600 --> 3:45:53.800\n And, you know, I.\n\n3:45:53.800 --> 3:45:55.520\n What do you think I'm doing with it?\n\n3:45:56.800 --> 3:45:58.360\n Making a difference, for one thing.\n\n3:45:58.360 --> 3:46:00.960\n But it's gonna be talking about cyber crime security,\n\n3:46:00.960 --> 3:46:01.800\n helping people.\n\n3:46:03.120 --> 3:46:03.960\n Interviews.\n\n3:46:03.960 --> 3:46:04.800\n Interviews.\n\n3:46:04.800 --> 3:46:06.480\n A lot of it's gonna be solo.\n\n3:46:06.480 --> 3:46:08.080\n Now I'm calling it the Brett Johnson show.\n\n3:46:08.080 --> 3:46:10.240\n I mean, because it's gonna handle crime,\n\n3:46:10.240 --> 3:46:12.200\n talk to criminals and how they turn their lives around\n\n3:46:12.200 --> 3:46:13.360\n to a degree as well.\n\n3:46:13.360 --> 3:46:15.240\n But there's some shit I wanna bitch about too.\n\n3:46:15.240 --> 3:46:16.080\n Yeah.\n\n3:46:16.080 --> 3:46:16.920\n So figure it out.\n\n3:46:16.920 --> 3:46:17.740\n I can tell you're good at this.\n\n3:46:17.740 --> 3:46:18.580\n I'm a fan already.\n\n3:46:18.580 --> 3:46:19.420\n I wanna listen.\n\n3:46:19.420 --> 3:46:20.240\n I wanna subscribe.\n\n3:46:20.240 --> 3:46:21.080\n You should too.\n\n3:46:21.080 --> 3:46:22.600\n You're launching it soon.\n\n3:46:22.600 --> 3:46:23.440\n Soon.\n\n3:46:23.440 --> 3:46:24.680\n Next week.\n\n3:46:24.680 --> 3:46:26.360\n Brett, you're an incredible human being.\n\n3:46:26.360 --> 3:46:29.920\n The honesty, the love.\n\n3:46:29.920 --> 3:46:33.280\n I could just see how much of yourself you put out there.\n\n3:46:33.280 --> 3:46:36.480\n One of the best public speakers I've ever heard.\n\n3:46:36.480 --> 3:46:38.440\n Definitely you should be in a Scorsese film\n\n3:46:38.440 --> 3:46:39.660\n about cyber crime.\n\n3:46:41.320 --> 3:46:43.840\n 100%, I could tell you're a good actor.\n\n3:46:43.840 --> 3:46:45.360\n It makes perfect sense.\n\n3:46:45.360 --> 3:46:47.280\n Anyway, I really, I'm deeply honored\n\n3:46:47.280 --> 3:46:48.960\n that you'll spend your time with me today.\n\n3:46:48.960 --> 3:46:49.800\n I am, actually.\n\n3:46:49.800 --> 3:46:50.640\n Thank you.\n\n3:46:50.640 --> 3:46:51.460\n It was amazing.\n\n3:46:51.460 --> 3:46:52.880\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n3:46:52.880 -->

3:46:59.640\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n3:46:59.640 --> 3:47:03.540\n from George R.R. Martin, from A Clash of Kings.\n\n3:47:04.500 --> 3:47:07.680\n A good act does not wash out the bad,\n\n3:47:07.680 --> 3:47:10.240\n nor a bad act the good.\n\n3:47:10.240 --> 3:47:12.280\n Each should have its own reward.\n\n3:47:12.280 --> 3:47:25.280\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
