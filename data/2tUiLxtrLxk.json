Multidisciplinary Association\n\n00:06.920 --> 00:09.720\n for Psychedelic Studies, MAPS.\n\n00:09.720 --> 00:11.520\n He is one of the seminal figures\n\n00:11.520 --> 00:12.920\n in both the cultural history\n\n00:12.920 --> 00:15.440\n and the cutting edge science of psychedelics.\n\n00:15.440 --> 00:18.360\n He was there along with the biggest characters\n\n00:18.360 --> 00:20.800\n throughout this fascinating history of psychedelics,\n\n00:20.800 --> 00:23.660\n and he is here to tell the story.\n\n00:23.660 --> 00:25.360\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:25.360 --> 00:29.660\n Theragun, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, and Asleep.\n\n00:29.660 --> 00:33.240\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:33.240 --> 00:34.960\n As a side note, let me say\n\n00:34.960 --> 00:37.800\n that exploring the places the human mind can go\n\n00:37.800 --> 00:40.120\n can help us understand where it comes from,\n\n00:40.120 --> 00:43.640\n how it works, and how to engineer mental journeys,\n\n00:43.640 --> 00:46.360\n whether that's through life experiences,\n\n00:46.360 --> 00:49.100\n chemical substances, brain computer interfaces,\n\n00:49.100 --> 00:52.800\n or interactions with artificial intelligence systems.\n\n00:52.800 --> 00:56.160\n On a personal level, I think the dissolution of the ego\n\n00:56.160 --> 00:58.120\n for stretches of time is a powerful tool\n\n00:58.120 --> 01:00.080\n for understanding yourself.\n\n01:00.080 --> 01:01.740\n A lot of things can do this,\n\n01:01.740 --> 01:04.800\n including jiu jitsu, literature, meditation,\n\n01:04.800 --> 01:07.880\n but psychedelics is definitely, or at least arguably,\n\n01:07.880 --> 01:11.720\n one of the most powerful, from psilocybin to DMT.\n\n01:11.720 --> 01:13.520\n I'm excited that people like Rick\n\n01:13.520 --> 01:15.400\n are leading the scientific research\n\n01:15.400 --> 01:18.880\n that reveals the efficacy and the safety of these substances\n\n01:18.880 --> 01:22.400\n so that their proper dosage and usage protocols\n\n01:22.400 --> 01:24.720\n can be understood and people like me\n\n01:24.720 --> 01:27.240\n can safely and effectively use them,\n\n01:27.240 --> 01:29.720\n not just for recreation,\n\n01:29.720 --> 01:33.600\n but for rigorous exploration of my own mind.\n\n01:33.600 --> 01:35.600\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,\n\n01:35.600 --> 01:38.840\n and here is my conversation with Rick Doblin.\n\n01:39.960 --> 01:42.760\n Could you give an introduction to psychedelics,\n\n01:42.760 --> 01:47.200\n like a big, bold, whirlwind overview?\n\n01:47.200 --> 01:48.920\n What are psychedelics?\n\n01:48.920 --> 01:51.640\n What are the kinds of psychedelics out there?\n\n01:51.640 --> 01:54.920\n In whatever way you think is meaningful.\n\n01:54.920 --> 01:58.040\n All right, well, when I started MAPS,\n\n01:58.040 --> 02:00.800\n the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies,\n\n02:00.800 --> 02:04.080\n it was very important for me that psychedelic be in the name.\n\n02:04.080 --> 02:07.760\n And the way in which the original meaning of psychedelic,\n\n02:09.600 --> 02:11.680\n it's mind manifesting.\n\n02:11.680 --> 02:13.520\n It was created by Humphrey Osmond\n\n02:13.520 --> 02:17.160\n in a dialogue with Aldous Huxley.\n\n02:17.160 --> 02:20.440\n And so psychedelic means mind manifesting.\n\n02:20.440 --> 02:24.480\n And so we interpret that very broadly\n\n02:24.480 --> 02:27.600\n to mean dreams are psychedelic.\n\n02:27.600 --> 02:30.520\n Anything that kind of brings things to the surface,\n\n02:30.520 --> 02:34.160\n holotropic breath work, hyperventilation is psychedelic.\n\n02:34.160 --> 02:35.560\n So most people think psychedelic\n\n02:35.560 --> 02:37.920\n is only about certain kind of chemical substances,\n\n02:37.920 --> 02:40.260\n either natural or synthetic,\n\n02:40.260 --> 02:42.920\n but we've got a much broader view of that.\n\n02:42.920 --> 02:45.500\n Meditation can be psychedelic in some ways,\n\n02:45.500 --> 02:48.120\n but our primary focus is on the drugs,\n\n02:48.120 --> 02:52.140\n is on the medicines or the, you might call them,\n\n02:52.140 --> 02:55.760\n some people might call them spiritual tools or sacraments.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:00.520\n There's sort of two general categories of those.\n\n03:00.520 --> 03:03.200\n One are what are called the classic psychedelics,\n\n03:03.200 --> 03:05.240\n and those are the ego dissolving,\n\n03:06.480 --> 03:10.200\n sort of merged into unitive states.\n\n03:10.200 --> 03:15.120\n Those are like LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, ayahuasca,\n\n03:15.120 --> 03:18.160\n ibogaine, DMT, things like that.\n\n03:18.160 --> 03:21.520\n And then there is MDMA, which some people even argue\n\n03:21.520 --> 03:22.880\n is not a psychedelic.\n\n03:22.880 --> 03:25.520\n They'll say it's an empathogen or an intactogen,\n\n03:25.520 --> 03:28.000\n it's about touching within or empathy.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:30.720\n It doesn't do the same kind of ego dissolution\n\n03:32.160 --> 03:35.040\n that the classic psychedelics do,\n\n03:35.040 --> 03:37.560\n but it brings material to the surface\n\n03:39.280 --> 03:41.980\n and it changes the way we process information.\n\n03:44.160 --> 03:48.680\n And so I think you can quibble about whether it's,\n\n03:48.680 --> 03:50.480\n it's certainly not a classic psychedelic,\n\n03:50.480 --> 03:52.680\n but I think MDMA is also a psychedelic.\n\n03:52.680 --> 03:54.760\n Marijuana, I would say, is a psychedelic.\n\n03:55.760 --> 03:58.240\n Marijuana is closer to the classic psychedelics\n\n03:58.240 --> 04:00.040\n than it is to MDMA.\n\n04:00.040 --> 04:03.120\n One point I like to make is dreams,\n\n04:03.120 --> 04:05.560\n because then everybody can relate to that.\n\n04:05.560 --> 04:06.560\n Dreams are psychedelic.\n\n04:06.560 --> 04:11.560\n Dreams bring emotions, feelings, ideas, concepts,\n\n04:12.880 --> 04:14.480\n in symbolic form a lot of times,\n\n04:14.480 --> 04:16.440\n or just in raw emotions to the surface.\n\n04:16.440 --> 04:19.100\n So when people hear the word psychedelic,\n\n04:19.100 --> 04:22.120\n often they are frightened by it.\n\n04:22.120 --> 04:24.040\n It's about loss of control.\n\n04:25.240 --> 04:29.200\n And it is, to an extent, loss of conscious control,\n\n04:29.200 --> 04:31.960\n particularly with the classic psychedelics.\n\n04:31.960 --> 04:33.080\n And we know with dreams\n\n04:33.080 --> 04:35.560\n that we can have frightening dreams, nightmares,\n\n04:35.560 --> 04:40.560\n but I think that anchoring the concept of psychedelic\n\n04:40.560 --> 04:43.000\n in dreams is really helpful for people to know\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:45.460\n that it's kind of a natural state\n\n04:45.460 --> 04:48.320\n and that there are other ways that you can catalyze it\n\n04:48.320 --> 04:49.640\n than by going to sleep,\n\n04:49.640 --> 04:51.640\n and that for thousands of years,\n\n04:51.640 --> 04:54.160\n substances have been used in that way.\n\n04:54.160 --> 04:55.920\n So you mentioned this idea of bringing something\n\n04:55.920 --> 04:58.540\n to the surface, which is really interesting.\n\n04:58.540 --> 05:01.640\n So can you maybe elaborate the surface\n\n05:01.640 --> 05:04.880\n and what is there in the depths of things\n\n05:04.880 --> 05:09.880\n and how does ego dissolution fits into that?\n\n05:10.040 --> 05:13.460\n Well, Aldous Huxley talked about the brain\n\n05:13.460 --> 05:15.260\n as a reducing valve,\n\n05:15.260 --> 05:18.120\n that we have an enormous amount of information.\n\n05:18.120 --> 05:20.240\n So right now there's an air conditioning sound\n\n05:20.240 --> 05:21.880\n in the background,\n\n05:21.880 --> 05:24.360\n but that's not crucial to what you and I are doing,\n\n05:24.360 --> 05:27.560\n talking to each other, so we kind of tune that out.\n\n05:27.560 --> 05:29.800\n There's all sorts of sights and sounds.\n\n05:29.800 --> 05:32.160\n There's incoming information\n\n05:32.160 --> 05:36.080\n in all the different sense modalities,\n\n05:36.080 --> 05:41.080\n and we have to figure out what's important to us.\n\n05:42.020 --> 05:47.020\n And so the mind, in a way, focuses a lot on\n\n05:47.020 --> 05:50.300\n what are our core needs?\n\n05:50.300 --> 05:53.420\n And we filter all the incoming information\n\n05:53.420 --> 05:55.860\n that we get towards focusing on what our core needs,\n\n05:55.860 --> 05:58.580\n and we can even get to Abraham Maslow\n\n05:58.580 --> 06:01.580\n and the hierarchy of needs about survival needs,\n\n06:01.580 --> 06:04.720\n belonging needs, esteem needs, go on.\n\n06:04.720 --> 06:09.720\n So I think what I mean by bringing things to the surface\n\n06:09.720 --> 06:16.720\n is that we tend to not focus on a lot of things\n\n06:17.600 --> 06:21.760\n that are coming, but we also push away\n\n06:21.760 --> 06:24.160\n things that are difficult emotionally,\n\n06:24.160 --> 06:26.760\n difficult cognitively.\n\n06:26.760 --> 06:29.360\n We all know that we're on this very short trajectory\n\n06:29.360 --> 06:30.360\n from birth to death,\n\n06:30.360 --> 06:32.880\n but we're not constantly thinking about dying,\n\n06:35.160 --> 06:37.480\n although that can actually be helpful\n\n06:37.480 --> 06:39.900\n to focus us on what's really important.\n\n06:40.960 --> 06:44.000\n Traumas are often suppressed.\n\n06:46.080 --> 06:49.480\n Conflicts, we see in America and around the world\n\n06:49.480 --> 06:51.640\n a kind of rise of irrationality\n\n06:53.680 --> 06:56.280\n where people push away their logic\n\n06:56.280 --> 07:01.240\n in order for their emotional tribal needs to be met.\n\n07:01.240 --> 07:04.880\n A lot of people are suffering from early childhood traumas\n\n07:04.880 --> 07:06.880\n of a different kinds or abandonment issues\n\n07:06.880 --> 07:08.040\n or anything.\n\n07:08.040 --> 07:11.840\n So we tend to focus on just what we need to survive\n\n07:11.840 --> 07:13.920\n and what we need for work and esteem.\n\n07:13.920 --> 07:18.920\n And so psychedelics, by dissolving this ego control\n\n07:19.580 --> 07:23.980\n or by with MDMA kind of strengthening our sense of self\n\n07:23.980 --> 07:25.940\n and our sense of self acceptance,\n\n07:25.940 --> 07:28.740\n we can bring in other information\n\n07:28.740 --> 07:32.360\n that have previously been too complicated or too painful.\n\n07:32.360 --> 07:33.800\n You don't think of psychedelics\n\n07:33.800 --> 07:36.520\n as conjuring up something new.\n\n07:36.520 --> 07:39.680\n It is more revealing something that is already there.\n\n07:39.680 --> 07:41.600\n I think that's a very crucial thing.\n\n07:41.600 --> 07:46.600\n So yes, Sasha Shulgin who sort of the godfather of MDMA,\n\n07:51.320 --> 07:52.980\n he sort of rediscovered it\n\n07:52.980 --> 07:57.600\n and brought it back into use.\n\n07:57.600 --> 08:01.240\n He talked about his first experience was with mescaline.\n\n08:01.240 --> 08:04.360\n His first psychedelic experience was with mescaline\n\n08:04.360 --> 08:06.000\n and he had a tremendous experience.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:09.520\n But what he said about it was he was having\n\n08:09.520 --> 08:13.800\n a human experience that the mescaline was helping him access\n\n08:13.800 --> 08:17.760\n rather than that he was having a mescaline experience.\n\n08:17.760 --> 08:19.660\n So that it's not like you pop a pill\n\n08:19.660 --> 08:21.640\n and you always have the same kind of experience\n\n08:21.640 --> 08:22.560\n as everybody else.\n\n08:22.560 --> 08:24.760\n The experience is not contained in the pill.\n\n08:24.760 --> 08:26.360\n The pill opens you up\n\n08:26.360 --> 08:28.420\n and you have an experience of yourself.\n\n08:29.320 --> 08:30.840\n Sometimes these are experiences\n\n08:30.840 --> 08:32.600\n that we've never consciously had.\n\n08:32.600 --> 08:35.400\n But we can say right now that we know\n\n08:35.400 --> 08:39.760\n that our body below the level of our conscious awareness\n\n08:39.760 --> 08:42.560\n has all these self healing mechanisms.\n\n08:42.560 --> 08:45.520\n And we don't modulate them\n\n08:46.840 --> 08:48.640\n to a large extent by conscious control.\n\n08:48.640 --> 08:51.420\n I mean, eventually we are learning more about the mind body\n\n08:51.420 --> 08:53.080\n and we learn about the placebo effect,\n\n08:53.080 --> 08:54.280\n how what we think is the case.\n\n08:54.280 --> 08:57.800\n But I think that there's experiences\n\n08:57.800 --> 09:00.660\n that are below our level of conscious awareness,\n\n09:00.660 --> 09:02.080\n particularly once we're adults\n\n09:02.080 --> 09:04.720\n that are more of these unit of mystical experiences,\n\n09:04.720 --> 09:06.200\n sense of connection.\n\n09:06.200 --> 09:07.680\n I think kids are like this a lot.\n\n09:07.680 --> 09:09.720\n We kind of come from the void, you could say,\n\n09:09.720 --> 09:11.080\n and you're born and you have\n\n09:12.860 --> 09:14.520\n a different way of processing information.\n\n09:14.520 --> 09:18.320\n One interesting point about that has to do with ketamine,\n\n09:18.320 --> 09:22.560\n which is been approved as ketamine for depression,\n\n09:22.560 --> 09:25.440\n but it's used for anesthesia.\n\n09:25.440 --> 09:29.800\n And roughly one 10th the anesthetic dose\n\n09:29.800 --> 09:31.840\n is a psychedelic dose.\n\n09:31.840 --> 09:34.360\n And when it's used in anesthesia,\n\n09:34.360 --> 09:36.520\n there's what's called the emergent phenomena.\n\n09:36.520 --> 09:40.380\n So this is, you get enough ketamine for,\n\n09:40.380 --> 09:42.360\n you can be operated on, you're not in pain,\n\n09:42.360 --> 09:44.840\n you're not really there, your ego's knocked out,\n\n09:44.840 --> 09:46.600\n but you can still breathe.\n\n09:46.600 --> 09:49.240\n But as the operations get over\n\n09:49.240 --> 09:52.000\n and then people metabolize the ketamine,\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.780\n there's a process that they call the emergent phenomena.\n\n09:54.780 --> 09:58.840\n It's like as you're emerging from this tranquilized state,\n\n09:58.840 --> 10:01.020\n and that's where you pass through the psychedelic phase.\n\n10:01.020 --> 10:03.520\n And they don't prepare people for that.\n\n10:03.520 --> 10:07.000\n And what we see is that a lot of adults\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.200\n have difficult times with that,\n\n10:09.200 --> 10:12.120\n but children don't seem to have those problems.\n\n10:12.120 --> 10:15.960\n Children are a little bit more already in this kind of state.\n\n10:15.960 --> 10:18.880\n And so ketamine is used quite frequently\n\n10:18.880 --> 10:21.140\n in children now for anesthesia.\n\n10:22.120 --> 10:24.600\n So all of that is to say to your question\n\n10:24.600 --> 10:27.120\n that I think the psychedelics\n\n10:27.120 --> 10:29.180\n reveal things that are within us.\n\n10:30.120 --> 10:32.800\n Some things that are how we process information\n\n10:32.800 --> 10:35.000\n back when we were children.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.960\n Other things that we've never thought of before\n\n10:36.960 --> 10:40.040\n that are sort of baked into our consciousness.\n\n10:41.960 --> 10:46.160\n There's one drug, 5MeO DMT.\n\n10:46.160 --> 10:49.920\n It's this toxin from a Sonoran toad\n\n10:49.920 --> 10:52.200\n that many people consider it to be the most powerful\n\n10:52.200 --> 10:54.020\n of all the psychedelics.\n\n10:54.020 --> 10:57.660\n And it kind of knocks the ego structures completely out of it\n\n10:57.660 --> 11:01.500\n and we experience something different,\n\n11:01.500 --> 11:03.760\n but it's something I think that's always within us.\n\n11:03.760 --> 11:04.800\n It's at a deeper layer.\n\n11:04.800 --> 11:07.260\n So we knock out some of the higher cognitive functions\n\n11:07.260 --> 11:09.240\n and then we experience things in a different way.\n\n11:09.240 --> 11:13.080\n So my sense is that these are human experiences\n\n11:13.080 --> 11:15.080\n that the psychedelics bring us to.\n\n11:15.080 --> 11:16.440\n Yeah, it's really profound.\n\n11:16.440 --> 11:18.960\n And DMT is a really interesting example.\n\n11:18.960 --> 11:23.160\n So Terence McKenna has talked about these machine elves.\n\n11:24.040 --> 11:28.820\n And there's this, I think from the people I've heard speak\n\n11:28.820 --> 11:30.280\n about the experience,\n\n11:30.280 --> 11:33.800\n there's a sense that you are traveling elsewhere\n\n11:33.800 --> 11:38.080\n to meet entities, whether they're elves or not.\n\n11:38.080 --> 11:42.640\n So in your sense, you're not traveling elsewhere.\n\n11:42.640 --> 11:44.760\n You're just revealing something that's within\n\n11:44.760 --> 11:47.720\n and maybe it's a particular mechanism\n\n11:47.720 --> 11:50.220\n of revealing what's already within.\n\n11:50.220 --> 11:51.640\n Yeah, and I knew Terence.\n\n11:51.640 --> 11:53.400\n I spent a lot of time talking with Terence\n\n11:53.400 --> 11:58.200\n and I do not ascribe to a lot of things that he was saying.\n\n11:58.200 --> 12:02.040\n He was a tremendous entertainer and I think he did a lot\n\n12:02.040 --> 12:03.680\n of really good things and focused us\n\n12:03.680 --> 12:05.960\n on the power of psychedelics.\n\n12:05.960 --> 12:10.220\n But I think I've never seen these quote machine elves.\n\n12:10.220 --> 12:14.160\n I think culture is more determinative\n\n12:14.160 --> 12:17.240\n of what people experience under psychedelics,\n\n12:17.240 --> 12:22.120\n your preconceptions, than we give it credit for.\n\n12:22.120 --> 12:26.920\n And so I think there's a lot of priming that you could say\n\n12:26.920 --> 12:30.560\n that people receive by stories from their culture.\n\n12:33.120 --> 12:37.000\n With ayahuasca, it's about jaguars and Amazonian animals.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:41.920\n And so I think these machine elves are this construct\n\n12:41.920 --> 12:46.880\n of Terence that other people do see.\n\n12:46.880 --> 12:50.560\n There's actually some people that are very interested\n\n12:50.560 --> 12:54.280\n in doing a study and that they're well funded\n\n12:54.280 --> 12:59.280\n and moving toward it to keep people on an IV infusion\n\n12:59.320 --> 13:02.600\n of DMT for them specifically to see,\n\n13:02.600 --> 13:05.480\n do they contact machine elves or aliens\n\n13:05.480 --> 13:07.480\n and what kind of information do they bring back\n\n13:07.480 --> 13:12.280\n from these other selves, other places or other entities?\n\n13:14.320 --> 13:16.520\n One question is, who are we?\n\n13:16.520 --> 13:20.480\n Are we connected to everything in the universe?\n\n13:20.480 --> 13:23.060\n We certainly know in many cases,\n\n13:23.060 --> 13:27.160\n you talk about waves or particles, the quantum approach.\n\n13:27.160 --> 13:32.160\n So I don't interpret experiences that we have\n\n13:32.600 --> 13:36.460\n of some entity that's somehow or other\n\n13:36.460 --> 13:39.480\n deep in our consciousness that's not us.\n\n13:39.480 --> 13:41.680\n It's a part of who we are.\n\n13:41.680 --> 13:43.480\n So I tend to interpret it in that way.\n\n13:43.480 --> 13:46.440\n The question is, how big are we?\n\n13:49.560 --> 13:52.840\n And how many ideas are within us\n\n13:52.840 --> 13:56.120\n that can be revealed by changing the perspective?\n\n13:56.120 --> 13:57.440\n You mentioned physics.\n\n13:59.240 --> 14:03.040\n What physicists, especially mathematical physicists\n\n14:03.040 --> 14:07.200\n or mathematicians do is they reveal truths\n\n14:07.200 --> 14:12.200\n by taking a slightly different perspective on a problem\n\n14:12.440 --> 14:17.200\n that reveals the simplicity of how it actually works\n\n14:17.200 --> 14:18.760\n in totally new ways.\n\n14:18.760 --> 14:20.200\n That's what Einstein did.\n\n14:20.200 --> 14:23.200\n Like every progress in physics\n\n14:23.200 --> 14:25.600\n and certainly every progress in mathematics\n\n14:25.600 --> 14:28.000\n requires you to take a different perspective.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:32.560\n And then perhaps that's exactly what psychedelics are doing.\n\n14:32.560 --> 14:36.840\n It's not that they're contacting aliens that are elsewhere.\n\n14:36.840 --> 14:39.280\n It may be revealing the connection between us\n\n14:39.280 --> 14:41.240\n and other living life forms,\n\n14:41.240 --> 14:43.360\n or actually it might be revealing\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.300\n a totally new perspective on what life is\n\n14:47.300 --> 14:50.800\n or what consciousness is and giving us a glimpse at that\n\n14:50.800 --> 14:53.920\n even though our cognitive capabilities are limited\n\n14:53.920 --> 14:56.040\n to fully grasp and understand it.\n\n14:56.040 --> 14:58.480\n So it's just giving us an inkling of that somehow.\n\n14:58.480 --> 15:01.080\n And it seems perhaps a little ridiculous\n\n15:01.080 --> 15:03.520\n not from a scientific perspective\n\n15:03.520 --> 15:06.620\n in the sense that we don't have a good physics of life\n\n15:06.620 --> 15:09.900\n or physics of intelligence or physics of consciousness,\n\n15:09.900 --> 15:11.920\n but getting a glimpse of that\n\n15:11.920 --> 15:15.680\n is giving us a little bit of maybe an intuition\n\n15:15.680 --> 15:20.680\n of which way to head to build such a physics.\n\n15:22.240 --> 15:23.560\n Yeah, yeah, I think so.\n\n15:23.560 --> 15:28.560\n I think that there's this other concept\n\n15:28.600 --> 15:30.700\n I guess I would like to talk about briefly,\n\n15:30.700 --> 15:33.540\n this Jungian collective unconscious,\n\n15:33.540 --> 15:36.100\n this idea that somehow or other everything\n\n15:36.100 --> 15:40.280\n that has ever happened is still accessible,\n\n15:40.280 --> 15:43.720\n maybe not with as much data\n\n15:43.720 --> 15:46.600\n or as much resolution,\n\n15:46.600 --> 15:49.720\n but that there's wave resonances.\n\n15:49.720 --> 15:54.720\n So that I do believe that we can have experiences\n\n15:55.320 --> 15:58.280\n as part of this human collective unconscious\n\n15:58.280 --> 16:01.080\n that we're not from our own life.\n\n16:01.080 --> 16:01.920\n Yeah.\n\n16:01.920 --> 16:06.240\n And that we can, it's like the holographic realities\n\n16:06.240 --> 16:10.780\n and that there is a way to gather information\n\n16:10.780 --> 16:13.640\n that can be accurate about other times and places\n\n16:15.560 --> 16:20.040\n through depth investigations of our own consciousness.\n\n16:20.040 --> 16:22.560\n But I think what I tend to believe\n\n16:22.560 --> 16:26.040\n is that it's because there's emotional resonances\n\n16:26.040 --> 16:28.840\n between where we're at now in this life\n\n16:28.840 --> 16:33.840\n and other kind of experiences\n\n16:35.520 --> 16:37.240\n that people have had before.\n\n16:37.240 --> 16:40.440\n And we always hear about everybody\n\n16:40.440 --> 16:41.560\n who talks about past lives,\n\n16:41.560 --> 16:43.340\n they're always kings and queens.\n\n16:44.800 --> 16:46.520\n So I think that's again,\n\n16:46.520 --> 16:48.840\n you filter things what you want to be true.\n\n16:48.840 --> 16:53.760\n But I do think that there is a way to access information\n\n16:53.760 --> 16:58.120\n beyond what we've taken in in our own temporal existence\n\n16:58.120 --> 16:59.720\n through our own five senses.\n\n16:59.720 --> 17:01.560\n In some ways, I really find that compelling,\n\n17:01.560 --> 17:04.160\n the notion that that information is already there\n\n17:04.160 --> 17:08.160\n and you're simply just moving the attention of your mind\n\n17:08.160 --> 17:10.040\n to different parts of that.\n\n17:10.040 --> 17:12.280\n Yeah, I mean, we have that with the radio.\n\n17:12.280 --> 17:17.000\n I mean, you got a frequency, you turn all this information,\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.960\n you could actually say right now in the space between us,\n\n17:19.960 --> 17:21.640\n we have the whole world's knowledge\n\n17:21.640 --> 17:23.080\n that's up on the internet.\n\n17:23.080 --> 17:24.560\n It's right here.\n\n17:24.560 --> 17:26.480\n But we don't see it. We just have to tune in.\n\n17:26.480 --> 17:27.320\n Yeah.\n\n17:28.580 --> 17:31.680\n What are the interesting differences,\n\n17:31.680 --> 17:34.560\n would you say, between the various psychedelics\n\n17:34.560 --> 17:38.140\n that you mentioned, ayahuasca, DMT, acid, LSD,\n\n17:38.140 --> 17:42.720\n marijuana, mescaline, PCP, psilocybin, MDMA?\n\n17:42.720 --> 17:44.800\n You mentioned a few of them that are really interesting.\n\n17:44.800 --> 17:47.800\n We'll talk about scientifically some of the different\n\n17:47.800 --> 17:49.960\n studies that have been conducted on each,\n\n17:49.960 --> 17:52.440\n but sort of at the high level.\n\n17:52.440 --> 17:54.160\n What are some interesting differences?\n\n17:54.160 --> 17:57.300\n Well, one of the big ones that people make a big deal of\n\n17:57.300 --> 17:59.920\n that I think is completely misplaced\n\n17:59.920 --> 18:03.080\n is some are from nature, some are from the lab.\n\n18:03.080 --> 18:05.400\n So there's this kind of like romantic thought\n\n18:05.400 --> 18:06.960\n that if it's from nature, it's good.\n\n18:06.960 --> 18:10.600\n If it's from the lab, it's somehow tainted by humanity.\n\n18:10.600 --> 18:13.960\n And therefore, some people are like\n\n18:13.960 --> 18:15.480\n all for plant psychedelics.\n\n18:15.480 --> 18:19.060\n We see the policy changes that have been happening\n\n18:19.060 --> 18:23.280\n in a couple of cities, Cambridge, Somerville,\n\n18:23.280 --> 18:24.720\n not far from where we're at now,\n\n18:24.720 --> 18:27.320\n where they decriminalize plant medicines.\n\n18:27.320 --> 18:29.320\n So they call it decriminalizing nature.\n\n18:30.640 --> 18:32.800\n So I think that there is,\n\n18:32.800 --> 18:36.360\n from my perspective,\n\n18:37.360 --> 18:40.160\n certain things from nature are poison,\n\n18:40.160 --> 18:44.800\n certain things from the lab are spiritual,\n\n18:44.800 --> 18:47.600\n even if they don't show up in nature, like LSD.\n\n18:47.600 --> 18:51.560\n Now there is something, LSD is lysergic acid diethylamide.\n\n18:51.560 --> 18:54.800\n There is lysergic acid amide, LSA,\n\n18:54.800 --> 18:56.320\n which comes from morning glory seeds.\n\n18:56.320 --> 18:57.620\n So it's very similar.\n\n18:57.620 --> 19:02.260\n But at the same time, I'd say,\n\n19:02.260 --> 19:03.740\n I don't buy into that distinction\n\n19:03.740 --> 19:06.260\n that there's some fundamental preference.\n\n19:06.260 --> 19:07.860\n One of the things that Terence McKenna,\n\n19:07.860 --> 19:09.460\n since we talked about him,\n\n19:09.460 --> 19:12.500\n he talked about how if it's from nature, it's good.\n\n19:12.500 --> 19:15.620\n And if it's not, we should be suspect.\n\n19:16.540 --> 19:18.580\n Of course, he had a lot of great LSD experiences.\n\n19:18.580 --> 19:22.060\n But actually Terence, in 1984,\n\n19:22.060 --> 19:24.820\n we were at Esalen with a bunch of other people.\n\n19:24.820 --> 19:27.780\n This was before the crackdown on MDMA.\n\n19:28.800 --> 19:31.540\n And this was some of the underground therapists\n\n19:31.540 --> 19:32.940\n and the above ground researchers\n\n19:32.940 --> 19:36.340\n who were trying to talk about how to protect MDMA\n\n19:36.340 --> 19:37.720\n from this eventual crackdown.\n\n19:37.720 --> 19:40.300\n And Terence was like, forget about it.\n\n19:40.300 --> 19:41.940\n It's from the lab.\n\n19:41.940 --> 19:42.760\n It's dangerous.\n\n19:42.760 --> 19:44.140\n We have thousands of years of history,\n\n19:44.140 --> 19:45.220\n all these other things.\n\n19:45.220 --> 19:48.460\n And what do we know about MDMA and blah, blah, blah.\n\n19:48.460 --> 19:51.460\n I was like, Terence, you're so unscientific.\n\n19:51.460 --> 19:54.300\n Another way to say it is, and I just said,\n\n19:54.300 --> 19:58.100\n we need a study of the safety of MDMA.\n\n19:58.100 --> 20:01.820\n And so then Dick Price, who started Esalen,\n\n20:01.820 --> 20:04.180\n I said, I'll put a thousand, Dick Price, he put a thousand.\n\n20:04.180 --> 20:06.100\n So Terence was actually the catalyst\n\n20:06.100 --> 20:07.860\n for the first study with MDMA.\n\n20:07.860 --> 20:10.580\n Just because he was so frustrating\n\n20:10.580 --> 20:11.900\n about how plants are okay.\n\n20:11.900 --> 20:14.740\n And if it's from the lab, it's bad.\n\n20:14.740 --> 20:16.500\n So that's one distinction.\n\n20:16.500 --> 20:19.780\n The other distinction is that he was a scientist.\n\n20:19.780 --> 20:24.780\n The other distinction is this sense of classic psychedelics\n\n20:26.420 --> 20:27.620\n versus things like MDMA.\n\n20:27.620 --> 20:31.020\n So to what extent do they dissolve the ego?\n\n20:31.020 --> 20:34.460\n And you could say, to what extent do they cause visions?\n\n20:34.460 --> 20:37.620\n The 5HT2A serotonin receptor subtype,\n\n20:39.060 --> 20:41.540\n which is responsible for a lot of that\n\n20:41.540 --> 20:43.240\n where these drugs are activating.\n\n20:45.460 --> 20:48.380\n Now, mescaline of all the psychedelics,\n\n20:48.380 --> 20:51.100\n chemically, it's the most similar to MDMA.\n\n20:51.100 --> 20:53.980\n It's a phenethylamine, which is MDMA.\n\n20:53.980 --> 20:57.720\n So in the 50s, there was the, 53, I think it was,\n\n20:57.720 --> 21:00.180\n the Army Chemical Warfare Service\n\n21:00.180 --> 21:03.360\n wanted to look at drugs for interrogations,\n\n21:03.360 --> 21:05.780\n mind control, nonlethal incapacitants.\n\n21:05.780 --> 21:10.780\n They did a study in eight substances.\n\n21:10.980 --> 21:13.740\n These were now toxicity studies in animals.\n\n21:13.740 --> 21:15.620\n And on the one side was methamphetamine,\n\n21:15.620 --> 21:18.740\n and the other was mescaline, and MDMA was in the middle,\n\n21:18.740 --> 21:19.920\n chemically.\n\n21:19.920 --> 21:23.500\n So mescaline of these psychedelics\n\n21:23.500 --> 21:27.440\n tends to have the warmth that MDMA has.\n\n21:27.440 --> 21:30.580\n It's not as ego dissolving quite as some of the others.\n\n21:30.580 --> 21:32.620\n I mean, it's the main active ingredient in peyote.\n\n21:32.620 --> 21:34.860\n It is very psychedelic, very visual.\n\n21:36.500 --> 21:39.260\n Another distinction with these different drugs\n\n21:39.260 --> 21:41.160\n is how long they last.\n\n21:41.160 --> 21:45.080\n And a lot of that has to do with the route of administration.\n\n21:45.080 --> 21:49.100\n So for example, if you smoke DMT,\n\n21:49.100 --> 21:52.300\n it takes 10, 15 minutes, and you're,\n\n21:52.300 --> 21:54.540\n within seconds, you're off in another world.\n\n21:54.540 --> 21:59.540\n Similarly, 5MeO DMT, very rapid.\n\n21:59.620 --> 22:03.140\n When you take DMT in the form of ayahuasca,\n\n22:03.140 --> 22:05.740\n where it's mixed with another substance\n\n22:05.740 --> 22:08.420\n that makes it so that it's orally active,\n\n22:08.420 --> 22:10.360\n then it's a couple hours.\n\n22:10.360 --> 22:15.360\n So LSD is eight, 10, 12 hours sometimes.\n\n22:16.640 --> 22:18.880\n Psilocybin is more like five or six hours,\n\n22:18.880 --> 22:21.280\n or four to six hours.\n\n22:21.280 --> 22:22.760\n MDMA is similar.\n\n22:23.720 --> 22:25.960\n It's one reason why in our research,\n\n22:25.960 --> 22:28.080\n we give an initial dose of MDMA,\n\n22:28.080 --> 22:28.960\n and then two hours later,\n\n22:28.960 --> 22:32.440\n we give half the initial amount to extend the plateau,\n\n22:32.440 --> 22:34.800\n because we want it to last longer\n\n22:34.800 --> 22:37.100\n for people to be in this therapeutic state.\n\n22:37.100 --> 22:42.100\n So that's another distinction is how long these drugs last.\n\n22:42.300 --> 22:44.360\n Another distinction is which of them\n\n22:44.360 --> 22:47.180\n come from a religious context,\n\n22:47.180 --> 22:49.280\n have a religion built around them.\n\n22:49.280 --> 22:52.180\n We have this sense that some people are saying\n\n22:52.180 --> 22:54.820\n that 5MeO DMT and the Sonoran Toad,\n\n22:54.820 --> 22:57.420\n that they have this long history of indigenous use,\n\n22:57.420 --> 22:58.780\n but they don't, that's all modern,\n\n22:58.780 --> 23:01.940\n it's made up, and it's kind of a new approach.\n\n23:01.940 --> 23:05.100\n However, there was thousands of years of use\n\n23:05.100 --> 23:08.020\n of psilocybin mushrooms in religious contexts.\n\n23:09.260 --> 23:14.260\n From 1600 BC to 396 AD,\n\n23:14.700 --> 23:17.100\n the world's longest mystery ceremonies,\n\n23:17.100 --> 23:18.600\n the Eleusinian Mysteries,\n\n23:19.900 --> 23:21.240\n sort of the heart of Greek culture,\n\n23:21.240 --> 23:22.500\n the heart of Western culture,\n\n23:22.500 --> 23:25.780\n that was a psychedelic potion called Kikion\n\n23:25.780 --> 23:29.520\n that seems like it's very much like an LSD like substance.\n\n23:29.520 --> 23:34.520\n Aragat on grain and LSD comes from Aragat.\n\n23:36.920 --> 23:39.640\n So I think that there are a lot of ways\n\n23:39.640 --> 23:41.120\n to look at these different substances.\n\n23:41.120 --> 23:45.000\n Another distinction is which one of them\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:48.280\n are being researched right now in scientific context\n\n23:48.280 --> 23:49.240\n and which are not.\n\n23:50.100 --> 23:52.720\n And because of the rise of all these for profit companies\n\n23:52.720 --> 23:54.800\n and everybody's looking for what they can patent,\n\n23:54.800 --> 23:57.440\n what they can claim, the land grab,\n\n23:57.440 --> 24:01.200\n more and more there are companies\n\n24:01.200 --> 24:04.360\n looking at every different kind of psychedelics.\n\n24:04.360 --> 24:06.400\n The ones that are most important\n\n24:06.400 --> 24:09.080\n that are not being researched, Mescaline,\n\n24:09.080 --> 24:11.080\n but now there's a company to do Mescaline,\n\n24:11.080 --> 24:14.000\n the Jernico Lab, Ibogaine,\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:17.160\n which is crucial for opiate addiction.\n\n24:17.160 --> 24:21.400\n There's a new company, a branch of this company,\n\n24:21.400 --> 24:23.720\n Atai, that's gonna be looking at Ibogaine.\n\n24:23.720 --> 24:27.480\n So I'd say the rise of the for profit companies\n\n24:27.480 --> 24:30.200\n is making it so that there's just gonna be\n\n24:30.200 --> 24:32.520\n an enormous amount of investigations\n\n24:32.520 --> 24:36.000\n into all these different psychedelics.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:39.680\n But what we're gonna see is the development\n\n24:39.680 --> 24:41.760\n of new psychedelics that we don't know anything about\n\n24:41.760 --> 24:42.840\n that have not existed yet\n\n24:42.840 --> 24:45.480\n because a lot of these for profit companies\n\n24:45.480 --> 24:48.280\n are gonna wanna invent and patent\n\n24:48.280 --> 24:51.880\n and have composition of matter patents on new molecules.\n\n24:51.880 --> 24:53.680\n So I think we'll see a lot of that happening too.\n\n24:53.680 --> 24:54.520\n That's really fascinating.\n\n24:54.520 --> 24:57.520\n I mean, there's a lot of doors you've opened\n\n24:57.520 --> 24:58.960\n and we're gonna walk through all of them,\n\n24:58.960 --> 25:00.380\n including the research and so on,\n\n25:00.380 --> 25:03.680\n but on this one little tangent\n\n25:03.680 --> 25:06.480\n of the future of psychedelics,\n\n25:06.480 --> 25:08.640\n so engineering new psychedelics,\n\n25:08.640 --> 25:12.120\n can you comment on maybe the chemistry\n\n25:12.120 --> 25:14.200\n and the biology of how psychedelics work\n\n25:14.200 --> 25:17.480\n and where is the space of possible engineering\n\n25:17.480 --> 25:19.080\n of psychedelics and what kind of things\n\n25:19.080 --> 25:24.080\n might they unlock in terms of the possible places\n\n25:24.560 --> 25:26.580\n our mind would be able to go\n\n25:26.580 --> 25:31.580\n and the effects of that of improving health,\n\n25:32.360 --> 25:35.760\n but maybe at the basic level of chemistry\n\n25:35.760 --> 25:37.800\n and the space of what could be engineered?\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.200\n Well, you reminded me,\n\n25:41.200 --> 25:42.540\n I'll get to exactly what you said,\n\n25:42.540 --> 25:45.760\n but you reminded me of a talk I heard\n\n25:45.760 --> 25:49.160\n by Buckminster Fuller shortly before he died.\n\n25:49.160 --> 25:52.960\n And what he talked about is how technology\n\n25:52.960 --> 25:57.200\n was making things ever smaller,\n\n25:57.200 --> 25:59.800\n that we are able to pack more and more information\n\n25:59.800 --> 26:02.440\n into smaller and smaller spaces\n\n26:02.440 --> 26:04.560\n and that we're developing technologies\n\n26:04.560 --> 26:06.880\n of communications with people,\n\n26:06.880 --> 26:08.780\n we now know the internet and things like that.\n\n26:08.780 --> 26:13.280\n But what he said is that he thought the eventual evolution\n\n26:13.280 --> 26:16.680\n of this sort of research would move\n\n26:16.680 --> 26:20.360\n from this miniaturization to telepathy.\n\n26:21.680 --> 26:22.840\n Yeah.\n\n26:22.840 --> 26:24.640\n And that was like a shocking thing\n\n26:24.640 --> 26:27.760\n for somebody like scientific like that to say that.\n\n26:27.760 --> 26:31.440\n So will we unlock those parts\n\n26:31.440 --> 26:33.760\n where I talked about the collective unconscious?\n\n26:33.760 --> 26:38.760\n Will we be able to more consciously explore those areas?\n\n26:39.280 --> 26:42.080\n So I think that that's a possibility.\n\n26:42.080 --> 26:44.200\n There was Stan Groff,\n\n26:44.200 --> 26:47.720\n who's the world's leading LSD researcher\n\n26:47.720 --> 26:51.640\n and has been my mentor, his wife Brigida.\n\n26:51.640 --> 26:54.200\n They were talking about stories that they had heard\n\n26:54.200 --> 26:59.200\n about MDMA that people take\n\n26:59.440 --> 27:01.880\n and then on top of that, they do 5MEO DMT.\n\n27:02.760 --> 27:05.360\n And so you get this ego dissolution,\n\n27:05.360 --> 27:09.240\n but underneath it, you have this sense of ego,\n\n27:09.240 --> 27:14.240\n sort of sense of self safety, of self acceptance,\n\n27:14.320 --> 27:15.260\n kind of grounds it.\n\n27:15.260 --> 27:19.240\n So Stan was like, that's the future of psychiatry,\n\n27:19.240 --> 27:21.680\n that you can watch without the terror\n\n27:21.680 --> 27:22.960\n of the ego dissolution,\n\n27:22.960 --> 27:24.600\n the sense that you're losing your mind\n\n27:24.600 --> 27:26.240\n or you're going crazy or you're dying,\n\n27:26.240 --> 27:29.920\n or that you have this grounded sense of safety\n\n27:29.920 --> 27:32.160\n while you're dissolving your normal sense\n\n27:32.160 --> 27:33.840\n of how you see things.\n\n27:33.840 --> 27:37.300\n And being able to engineer in a fine tuned way\n\n27:37.300 --> 27:41.020\n that exact experience, maybe fine tuned to the person,\n\n27:41.020 --> 27:43.240\n as opposed to sort of this manual potion\n\n27:43.240 --> 27:46.960\n that's through experiment.\n\n27:46.960 --> 27:48.760\n Although I don't know about fine tuning things\n\n27:48.760 --> 27:50.680\n to the person in the sense that\n\n27:50.680 --> 27:52.320\n we believe there's this inner healer,\n\n27:52.320 --> 27:55.080\n this kind of inner healing intelligence.\n\n27:55.080 --> 27:57.980\n We talked about it, the body repairs itself.\n\n27:57.980 --> 28:02.980\n So I think we more need to create safety for people\n\n28:03.860 --> 28:06.200\n and then what emerges will be customized\n\n28:06.200 --> 28:07.480\n to what they need to be looking at\n\n28:07.480 --> 28:09.160\n from this inner healing intelligence.\n\n28:09.160 --> 28:11.320\n At the same time, we will move to,\n\n28:12.400 --> 28:17.400\n we hear so much about the new approaches to oncology\n\n28:18.560 --> 28:23.260\n where you do genetic analysis of different kinds of tumors\n\n28:23.260 --> 28:25.960\n and then you have certain kind of chemotherapy agents\n\n28:25.960 --> 28:27.980\n and you do like personalized chemotherapy.\n\n28:27.980 --> 28:29.840\n I think we will have more like\n\n28:29.840 --> 28:32.040\n personalized psychedelic therapy,\n\n28:32.040 --> 28:34.680\n but it'll be more like a sequence of different drugs\n\n28:34.680 --> 28:37.440\n that people go through over an extended period of time\n\n28:37.440 --> 28:40.320\n and then you kind of customize what's next\n\n28:40.320 --> 28:42.560\n and sometimes you'll combine different drugs together\n\n28:42.560 --> 28:45.440\n like this 5MeO DMT and MDMA\n\n28:45.440 --> 28:48.920\n or a lot of times people do LSD MDMA combinations\n\n28:48.920 --> 28:51.100\n or psilocybin MDMA combinations.\n\n28:52.720 --> 28:56.720\n Chemistry is not my strength.\n\n28:56.720 --> 29:01.200\n I'm more into clinical applications and policy,\n\n29:01.200 --> 29:03.760\n but I can say that from what I've learned\n\n29:03.760 --> 29:06.920\n from reading from others and research done by others\n\n29:06.920 --> 29:10.540\n that different psychedelics have an impact\n\n29:10.540 --> 29:12.440\n on different neurotransmitters,\n\n29:12.440 --> 29:14.920\n different other parts of energies in the brain.\n\n29:16.400 --> 29:20.480\n The default mode network is what's considered\n\n29:20.480 --> 29:25.480\n to be like our sense of self and it's part of the brain\n\n29:25.780 --> 29:27.240\n that sort of is what I described before,\n\n29:27.240 --> 29:30.260\n scanning the world and filtering information\n\n29:30.260 --> 29:33.400\n for what's really important to us\n\n29:33.400 --> 29:36.260\n and both focusing us on things\n\n29:36.260 --> 29:39.180\n and also helping us to ignore a lot of things.\n\n29:40.440 --> 29:43.840\n And the classic psychedelics all weaken the energy\n\n29:43.840 --> 29:45.920\n in this default mode system\n\n29:45.920 --> 29:48.000\n and therefore you get this flood of information\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:49.840\n that you're not normally paying attention to\n\n29:49.840 --> 29:52.840\n and then you start seeing in the more creative waves\n\n29:52.840 --> 29:56.360\n or more connected, you actually move to\n\n29:56.360 --> 29:57.980\n beyond the verbal kind of thinking\n\n29:57.980 --> 30:01.400\n into sort of symbolic thinking a lot of times\n\n30:01.400 --> 30:03.840\n and that's where you sometimes get\n\n30:03.840 --> 30:06.620\n these mystical sense of connection, how it's all one\n\n30:06.620 --> 30:11.620\n and you get the sense also of how big the universe is\n\n30:12.560 --> 30:14.480\n and how small each one of us is.\n\n30:15.520 --> 30:18.520\n So there's a lot of work that Sasha Shulgin\n\n30:18.520 --> 30:20.940\n and Albert Hoffman who invented LSD\n\n30:20.940 --> 30:22.320\n and first synthesized psilocybin\n\n30:22.320 --> 30:24.960\n on what they call structure activity relationships.\n\n30:24.960 --> 30:27.300\n What is the structural molecule\n\n30:27.300 --> 30:31.000\n and then how do you predict what that new molecule\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.320\n that never existed before is going to do\n\n30:33.320 --> 30:35.520\n once you actually take it?\n\n30:35.520 --> 30:40.520\n And you can get close, but you never really know\n\n30:40.680 --> 30:43.020\n until you actually take the drug.\n\n30:43.020 --> 30:47.480\n And the way that Sasha ran his experiments\n\n30:47.480 --> 30:51.920\n is that he would take the drugs himself first in low doses\n\n30:51.920 --> 30:55.000\n and he would sort of step up the doses\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:56.000\n to have more experiences.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:56.960\n If he thought it was valuable,\n\n30:56.960 --> 30:58.720\n he'd share it with his wife, Ann,\n\n30:58.720 --> 31:01.280\n but then what they would do is\n\n31:01.280 --> 31:02.560\n if they both thought it was valuable,\n\n31:02.560 --> 31:04.920\n they had a group of 12 people\n\n31:04.920 --> 31:07.360\n that they were with for many, many years\n\n31:07.360 --> 31:10.800\n and they would distribute these new drug to these 12 people\n\n31:10.800 --> 31:13.560\n and they would get the different perspectives.\n\n31:13.560 --> 31:15.920\n And he felt that 12 was like a minimum number\n\n31:15.920 --> 31:18.840\n because we're so unique how each of us see things,\n\n31:18.840 --> 31:21.040\n but then you kind of get a little bit of a consensus\n\n31:21.040 --> 31:22.560\n on how a lot of people are gonna see it\n\n31:22.560 --> 31:25.580\n and then if that 12 people were positive about it,\n\n31:25.580 --> 31:27.360\n then they would turn it over to Leo Zeph,\n\n31:27.360 --> 31:29.240\n who we called the secret chief,\n\n31:29.240 --> 31:31.320\n the leader of the underground psychedelic therapy movement\n\n31:31.320 --> 31:33.760\n and then he would start exploring it in therapy.\n\n31:34.760 --> 31:38.320\n So there's still a lot of mysteries\n\n31:38.320 --> 31:40.560\n as far as structure activity relationships\n\n31:40.560 --> 31:43.400\n and it's not gonna be the case that people go into the lab\n\n31:43.400 --> 31:45.400\n and they tinker with molecules\n\n31:45.400 --> 31:47.600\n and they know exactly what they're gonna get.\n\n31:48.760 --> 31:50.360\n And a lot of it has to do with\n\n31:51.560 --> 31:54.840\n not so much chemistry as morphology.\n\n31:54.840 --> 31:56.720\n You could say the shape of the molecule\n\n31:56.720 --> 31:59.560\n and how does that interact with receptor sites.\n\n31:59.560 --> 32:02.120\n And so we're getting better at modeling all of that.\n\n32:03.400 --> 32:04.800\n And how does that interaction relate\n\n32:04.800 --> 32:08.280\n to the morphing of the human experience\n\n32:08.280 --> 32:11.040\n and deeply understanding that perhaps\n\n32:11.040 --> 32:13.200\n there's no equations yet for that kind of thing.\n\n32:13.200 --> 32:17.240\n You really have to build up intuition by experiencing it.\n\n32:17.240 --> 32:20.620\n And over time and sort of subjective self report,\n\n32:20.620 --> 32:22.960\n like trying to build an understanding\n\n32:22.960 --> 32:24.800\n of the effects of the different chemistries.\n\n32:24.800 --> 32:29.280\n Yeah, you can have approximate ideas, but to know exactly.\n\n32:29.280 --> 32:34.080\n So when I first tried MDMA, which was 1982\n\n32:34.080 --> 32:37.400\n and this was after I had done lots of LSD\n\n32:37.400 --> 32:41.200\n and mescaline and mushrooms,\n\n32:41.200 --> 32:44.600\n I was shocked at how different it was\n\n32:44.600 --> 32:49.280\n than these other substances and yet how profound it was.\n\n32:49.280 --> 32:52.120\n So are there whole new kind of categories\n\n32:52.120 --> 32:54.600\n of classes of drugs that we're not aware of\n\n32:54.600 --> 32:59.600\n that would be not so much this like eco dissolution\n\n33:00.120 --> 33:01.960\n or emotional?\n\n33:01.960 --> 33:05.880\n Well, what MDMA does is reduces activity in the amygdala,\n\n33:05.880 --> 33:08.220\n the fear processing part of the brain.\n\n33:08.220 --> 33:11.160\n So it's not just chemistry, but it routes energy\n\n33:11.160 --> 33:12.680\n throughout the brain in a different way.\n\n33:12.680 --> 33:15.880\n It increases activity in the prefrontal cortex.\n\n33:15.880 --> 33:17.600\n So you think more logically,\n\n33:17.600 --> 33:21.680\n that I think has an enormous impact on the effect of MDMA.\n\n33:21.680 --> 33:25.200\n The other thing it does is it increases connectivity\n\n33:25.200 --> 33:26.760\n between the amygdala and the hippocampus.\n\n33:26.760 --> 33:30.340\n So it helps facilitate processing of things\n\n33:30.340 --> 33:31.720\n into longterm memory.\n\n33:32.820 --> 33:35.440\n And with PTSD, trauma is like never in the past,\n\n33:35.440 --> 33:36.520\n it's always about to happen.\n\n33:36.520 --> 33:39.560\n So will we one time develop drugs\n\n33:39.560 --> 33:43.520\n that would even be specific to certain kinds of memories?\n\n33:43.520 --> 33:46.400\n We're working with a woman, Rachel Yehuda,\n\n33:46.400 --> 33:50.120\n who is at the Bronx VA,\n\n33:50.120 --> 33:52.320\n and she's done some studies\n\n33:52.320 --> 33:55.320\n that are with the epigenetics of trauma.\n\n33:55.320 --> 33:58.800\n So she's worked with Holocaust survivors and their children,\n\n33:58.800 --> 34:03.560\n and she has identified epigenetic mechanisms\n\n34:03.560 --> 34:05.120\n by which trauma is passed\n\n34:05.120 --> 34:07.400\n from generation to the generations.\n\n34:07.400 --> 34:10.120\n Sort of like set points for anxiety,\n\n34:10.120 --> 34:11.760\n fear, certain things like that.\n\n34:11.760 --> 34:16.080\n But the question is, can you actually transmit memories\n\n34:16.080 --> 34:18.720\n from one generation to the next?\n\n34:18.720 --> 34:22.360\n Now, this is not DNA changes\n\n34:24.360 --> 34:26.520\n which happen over a very long period of time\n\n34:26.520 --> 34:28.760\n and evolutionary scale.\n\n34:28.760 --> 34:31.680\n But within one lifetime, within some experiences,\n\n34:31.680 --> 34:34.240\n your epigenetics, what turns on the genes\n\n34:34.240 --> 34:37.160\n or turns off certain genes, that can be impacted.\n\n34:37.160 --> 34:39.560\n And that's what we know now can be transmitted\n\n34:39.560 --> 34:41.880\n from generation to generation,\n\n34:41.880 --> 34:43.560\n either by the father or the mother\n\n34:43.560 --> 34:45.820\n through the sperm or the egg.\n\n34:45.820 --> 34:48.720\n So it's pretty remarkable.\n\n34:48.720 --> 34:53.460\n So what Rachel's gonna try to do is MDMA research for PTSD\n\n34:53.460 --> 34:56.400\n and look at these epigenetic markers before and after\n\n34:56.400 --> 35:00.280\n and see if they change as a consequence of therapy.\n\n35:00.280 --> 35:05.280\n So will we develop one day certain kind of chemicals\n\n35:05.440 --> 35:08.080\n that will be able to bring certain kind of memories\n\n35:08.080 --> 35:09.160\n to the surface?\n\n35:10.400 --> 35:12.600\n That's not inconceivable.\n\n35:12.600 --> 35:14.960\n The epigenetic angle is fascinating,\n\n35:14.960 --> 35:17.600\n that there'll be these epigenetic perturbations\n\n35:17.600 --> 35:19.840\n that lead to memories living\n\n35:19.840 --> 35:22.840\n from one generation to the other\n\n35:22.840 --> 35:25.200\n and then bringing those memories to the surface\n\n35:25.200 --> 35:30.200\n and using that as signal to understand\n\n35:30.280 --> 35:34.640\n what exactly the psychedelics bring to the surface and not.\n\n35:34.640 --> 35:35.480\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n35:35.480 --> 35:38.240\n Now, the other portion of that though is culture.\n\n35:38.240 --> 35:40.680\n I mean, culture is where we store all these memories\n\n35:40.680 --> 35:44.200\n and in the stories that we get passed out.\n\n35:44.200 --> 35:46.000\n Especially with a lot of shared,\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.880\n you talk about the Holocaust or World War II,\n\n35:48.880 --> 35:53.560\n where it's deeply ingrained in the culture,\n\n35:53.560 --> 35:55.360\n the impact of those events\n\n35:55.360 --> 35:57.680\n and sort of in aggregate the different perspectives\n\n35:57.680 --> 36:01.440\n on that particular event create a set of stories\n\n36:01.440 --> 36:03.120\n that you can plug into.\n\n36:03.120 --> 36:06.560\n And then they kind of resonate with some aspect of you\n\n36:06.560 --> 36:09.560\n that creates a memory that's connected to,\n\n36:09.560 --> 36:12.080\n like when I think about World War II and the Holocaust,\n\n36:12.080 --> 36:13.760\n I think about my own family,\n\n36:13.760 --> 36:15.700\n but in some sense,\n\n36:15.700 --> 36:19.000\n it's also resonating with stories of many others.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:22.040\n So it's like somehow the two echo each other\n\n36:22.040 --> 36:24.960\n and I'm just providing my own little flavor on top.\n\n36:24.960 --> 36:26.760\n The meat of the stories\n\n36:26.760 --> 36:29.280\n are probably those that are shared with others.\n\n36:29.280 --> 36:32.320\n It's plugging into the collective unconscious.\n\n36:32.320 --> 36:34.760\n That's really fascinating,\n\n36:34.760 --> 36:38.720\n really plugging into like precisely\n\n36:38.720 --> 36:40.680\n plugging into particular memories\n\n36:40.680 --> 36:45.680\n as a way to deal with trauma and PTSD, that kind of thing.\n\n36:47.960 --> 36:51.120\n Yeah, I'll just add that the most important dream\n\n36:51.120 --> 36:54.180\n of my life ever was of a Holocaust survivor\n\n36:54.180 --> 36:59.180\n telling me that he was miraculously saved from death\n\n37:02.320 --> 37:04.780\n and he knew that he was saved for a particular purpose,\n\n37:04.780 --> 37:06.560\n but he never knew what that purpose was.\n\n37:06.560 --> 37:08.360\n So in the dream, I'm seeing him on his deathbed\n\n37:08.360 --> 37:11.600\n and then he shows me whatever happened to him\n\n37:11.600 --> 37:12.700\n during the Holocaust.\n\n37:13.560 --> 37:16.360\n And then we're back in the room on his deathbed\n\n37:16.360 --> 37:20.520\n and he says, well, I know what my purpose was now.\n\n37:20.520 --> 37:22.100\n And I'm like, oh, great, what was it?\n\n37:22.100 --> 37:24.440\n He says, it's to tell you to be a psychedelic therapist\n\n37:24.440 --> 37:25.740\n and to study psychedelics\n\n37:25.740 --> 37:28.440\n and bring back psychedelic research.\n\n37:28.440 --> 37:31.920\n And I thought to myself, I've already decided to do this.\n\n37:31.920 --> 37:33.080\n You can lay this on me.\n\n37:33.080 --> 37:35.240\n I can say yes and then you can die in peace.\n\n37:35.240 --> 37:38.160\n And then he died in front of my eyes in the dream.\n\n37:38.160 --> 37:43.040\n So I think that that kind of cultural transmission\n\n37:43.040 --> 37:45.680\n that I got from when I was really young,\n\n37:45.680 --> 37:47.500\n then manifested in this dream.\n\n37:47.500 --> 37:51.800\n And that was this story about how people\n\n37:51.800 --> 37:55.240\n can be incredibly vicious\n\n37:55.240 --> 37:58.920\n and can be very motivated by irrational factors.\n\n37:58.920 --> 38:02.400\n And so I just feel that this kind of\n\n38:02.400 --> 38:05.680\n multi generational transmission of this story\n\n38:05.680 --> 38:09.240\n of the irrational being a murderous factor\n\n38:10.800 --> 38:15.400\n and something I needed to respond to was deeply ingrained.\n\n38:15.400 --> 38:19.960\n And I would say my guess is more culturally\n\n38:19.960 --> 38:22.080\n than this epigenetic mechanism.\n\n38:22.080 --> 38:23.440\n Yes.\n\n38:23.440 --> 38:27.240\n Yeah, but your sense is that whatever stimulated\n\n38:27.240 --> 38:32.240\n a certain part of human nature in World War II,\n\n38:32.240 --> 38:37.240\n especially Nazi Germany, but also in Stalinist Soviet Union,\n\n38:37.680 --> 38:40.280\n still is within us, within all of us.\n\n38:40.280 --> 38:41.680\n Just like what we're saying,\n\n38:44.520 --> 38:47.000\n we embody quite a lot of things.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:47.840\n Yeah.\n\n38:47.840 --> 38:52.320\n And one of those is whatever the capacity for evil\n\n38:53.680 --> 38:56.400\n seems to be one of those things.\n\n38:56.400 --> 38:58.880\n Yeah, there's a quote from Carl Jung\n\n38:58.880 --> 39:03.360\n from just a few years before he died.\n\n39:03.360 --> 39:05.980\n What he says, and I'll just paraphrase it is\n\n39:05.980 --> 39:09.220\n that we need to understand psychology.\n\n39:10.200 --> 39:14.220\n We need to understand who man is,\n\n39:14.220 --> 39:18.360\n that the greatest danger to us is man.\n\n39:18.360 --> 39:22.680\n There are no other dangers really that impact our species.\n\n39:23.760 --> 39:25.920\n And then he goes on to say that\n\n39:25.920 --> 39:29.120\n we are the source of all coming evil.\n\n39:30.120 --> 39:34.000\n Now this was 15 years or so after World War II.\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:36.320\n But yeah, and I'd say one of the most important\n\n39:36.320 --> 39:39.240\n psychedelic experiences of my life was a DMT experience.\n\n39:39.240 --> 39:43.120\n Also Terrence was there, Ralph Metzner,\n\n39:43.120 --> 39:44.880\n Andy Weil, a few others.\n\n39:44.880 --> 39:49.880\n And we were sitting around at Esalen smoking DMT.\n\n39:50.800 --> 39:53.440\n And under the influence of DMT,\n\n39:53.440 --> 39:56.300\n which now this was the first time I've ever smoked DMT,\n\n39:57.720 --> 40:01.260\n I had this super rapid fraction of a second,\n\n40:01.260 --> 40:03.520\n like dissolving of everything that I,\n\n40:03.520 --> 40:06.200\n well, first off I saw a horizontal line,\n\n40:06.200 --> 40:09.060\n then I saw a vertical line, then it turned into a color,\n\n40:09.060 --> 40:11.440\n red, then it was red, then it turned into cubes,\n\n40:11.440 --> 40:14.220\n then it turned into like an MC Escher kind of like,\n\n40:14.220 --> 40:17.040\n I don't know, you know, didn't make logical sense.\n\n40:17.040 --> 40:18.700\n And then I was gone.\n\n40:18.700 --> 40:23.340\n And then it was just this period of five, 10 minutes\n\n40:23.340 --> 40:26.560\n of just feeling part of this enormous wave\n\n40:26.560 --> 40:29.080\n of billions of years of evolution,\n\n40:29.080 --> 40:32.740\n how I had this sense that in my innermost sense\n\n40:32.740 --> 40:35.920\n of who I am uniquely individually,\n\n40:35.920 --> 40:37.800\n this inner voice that's talking to me\n\n40:37.800 --> 40:40.000\n that I didn't develop English,\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:43.520\n that it's like a gift to me from millions of people.\n\n40:43.520 --> 40:48.520\n So that even in my most innermost sense, it's not just me.\n\n40:48.680 --> 40:51.060\n It's the product of everything that came before me.\n\n40:51.060 --> 40:53.640\n I'm part of this bigger system.\n\n40:53.640 --> 40:55.080\n And then I just thought, wow,\n\n40:55.080 --> 40:57.240\n just how many billions of years does it take\n\n40:57.240 --> 40:59.820\n to reach this point of self awareness and all this?\n\n40:59.820 --> 41:01.080\n And it was glorious, beautiful.\n\n41:01.080 --> 41:02.480\n And then I had this thought,\n\n41:03.400 --> 41:06.860\n and this is where this kind of intellectual honesty,\n\n41:06.860 --> 41:08.120\n I guess you could say, I just thought,\n\n41:08.120 --> 41:09.360\n well, if I'm part of everything\n\n41:09.360 --> 41:11.040\n and everything's part of me,\n\n41:11.040 --> 41:12.880\n then it's not just the good parts,\n\n41:12.880 --> 41:15.080\n that Hitler's part of me too.\n\n41:15.080 --> 41:19.120\n And that was just this shock, like a stone sunk,\n\n41:19.120 --> 41:22.800\n and I just was very moody for the whole next day.\n\n41:22.800 --> 41:24.800\n But it was that acknowledgement\n\n41:24.800 --> 41:27.440\n that each of us carries these potentials,\n\n41:27.440 --> 41:29.460\n and what we activate is what matters,\n\n41:29.460 --> 41:34.120\n but what our potential are is the whole full range of things.\n\n41:34.120 --> 41:35.200\n I don't know if you can comment\n\n41:35.200 --> 41:39.000\n about the DMT trip itself and what it's like,\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:42.080\n starting from the very basic geometric shapes\n\n41:42.080 --> 41:46.080\n and then launching yourself into the context\n\n41:46.080 --> 41:50.140\n of the enormity of space and time in the human history.\n\n41:52.400 --> 41:54.040\n Is there anything else to be said\n\n41:54.040 --> 41:59.040\n about that kind of visually or physically\n\n42:00.240 --> 42:02.760\n or emotionally about that journey?\n\n42:02.760 --> 42:06.840\n What it's like, that brief journey that reveals so much?\n\n42:07.900 --> 42:10.040\n Well, I was with a group of people.\n\n42:10.040 --> 42:14.800\n The way we were doing it was each of us would smoke DMT,\n\n42:14.800 --> 42:17.600\n have 10, 15 minutes experience while we closed our eyes,\n\n42:17.600 --> 42:19.320\n and everybody else was just chatting,\n\n42:19.320 --> 42:21.840\n and then the person who did the DMT would come back\n\n42:21.840 --> 42:24.240\n and tell their story of what happened.\n\n42:24.240 --> 42:26.000\n And then we'd think about it for a bit\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:27.600\n and then pass the pipe to the next person.\n\n42:27.600 --> 42:29.580\n And so this was like a whole evening.\n\n42:30.920 --> 42:32.320\n So even the, sorry to interrupt,\n\n42:32.320 --> 42:34.100\n even the conversations themselves then\n\n42:34.100 --> 42:35.840\n is part of the experience.\n\n42:35.840 --> 42:39.240\n Exactly, yes, yes, because it's also what you bring back.\n\n42:39.240 --> 42:42.280\n I mean, I think that's particularly for therapy.\n\n42:42.280 --> 42:45.240\n It's not so much about what the experience is,\n\n42:45.240 --> 42:48.720\n but it's what you bring back and what do you integrate.\n\n42:48.720 --> 42:52.560\n And then also, how do you learn how to do these things\n\n42:52.560 --> 42:54.560\n on your own without the drugs?\n\n42:54.560 --> 42:56.340\n There is this way, because we're saying\n\n42:56.340 --> 42:58.360\n it's sort of a core human experience,\n\n42:58.360 --> 43:01.920\n the drug is the mediator, but can we do this on our own?\n\n43:01.920 --> 43:04.440\n And once you've seen it and felt it,\n\n43:04.440 --> 43:06.000\n then you have a little bit better sense\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:08.240\n to recreate it on your own.\n\n43:08.240 --> 43:11.860\n Although, I've had dreams where I've been doing LSD\n\n43:11.860 --> 43:14.560\n and tripping and it was just incredible.\n\n43:14.560 --> 43:17.320\n It was, I was tripping in my dreams,\n\n43:17.320 --> 43:19.760\n but I had not taken LSD.\n\n43:19.760 --> 43:22.020\n So there's this way in which we do that.\n\n43:22.020 --> 43:26.040\n So I would say that from the DMT experience,\n\n43:26.040 --> 43:28.160\n the sense of safety, that's what I was trying to get at\n\n43:28.160 --> 43:30.760\n with this, the group of us and this group of friends\n\n43:30.760 --> 43:32.500\n trying to do this common exploration,\n\n43:32.500 --> 43:34.880\n that if you have this sense of safety,\n\n43:34.880 --> 43:38.200\n you're incredibly vulnerable\n\n43:38.200 --> 43:43.080\n because you are giving up your awareness really\n\n43:43.080 --> 43:44.840\n of what's happening around you.\n\n43:44.840 --> 43:49.440\n I think there's, what we're finding is that\n\n43:49.440 --> 43:52.960\n in our psychedelic research for PTSD\n\n43:54.860 --> 43:56.480\n and what we see with the vaccines,\n\n43:56.480 --> 43:59.200\n that even African Americans are reluctant\n\n43:59.200 --> 44:02.560\n to volunteer for vaccines because they haven't had\n\n44:02.560 --> 44:05.700\n that sense of safety from the medical establishment.\n\n44:05.700 --> 44:10.500\n They don't volunteer for psychedelic therapy even as much.\n\n44:10.500 --> 44:14.280\n So the overlay has to be this sense of safety\n\n44:14.280 --> 44:18.300\n as you become vulnerable and looking inside, you're not.\n\n44:18.300 --> 44:22.180\n I was just actually told about how there's a lot of work\n\n44:22.180 --> 44:25.520\n being done inside prisons to teach mindfulness.\n\n44:25.520 --> 44:27.960\n And so one of the,\n\n44:29.840 --> 44:32.280\n Charlene who's my assistant is trying to do work\n\n44:32.280 --> 44:36.400\n on helping people in prison with trauma,\n\n44:36.400 --> 44:39.520\n potentially one day with MDMA or meditation or mindfulness.\n\n44:39.520 --> 44:42.840\n But one of the exercises was teaching people to,\n\n44:42.840 --> 44:45.020\n okay, here's how you deal with stress,\n\n44:45.020 --> 44:46.800\n just close your eyes and deep breathe.\n\n44:46.800 --> 44:49.400\n And what Charlene was saying is people don't close their eyes\n\n44:49.400 --> 44:52.360\n in prison, you don't feel safe to do that.\n\n44:52.360 --> 44:57.360\n So all that is just to say is that the context\n\n44:57.840 --> 44:59.780\n is the most important factor.\n\n44:59.780 --> 45:02.240\n So while I'll talk about the DMT experience,\n\n45:02.240 --> 45:07.160\n the context was this supportive sense of safety\n\n45:07.160 --> 45:09.120\n that I could be completely vulnerable\n\n45:09.120 --> 45:12.920\n and out of any kind of controlled women,\n\n45:12.920 --> 45:16.820\n I think often are less safe in this way than men\n\n45:16.820 --> 45:18.520\n because of all the sexual assaults.\n\n45:20.760 --> 45:25.760\n But what it can do by taking the ego orientation offline\n\n45:26.920 --> 45:29.960\n to some extent, it opens you up to much more.\n\n45:29.960 --> 45:32.620\n And to make a bigger point of that,\n\n45:33.720 --> 45:35.920\n we could say that it's very similar\n\n45:35.920 --> 45:38.060\n to the Copernican revolution.\n\n45:38.060 --> 45:40.060\n And people thought that the earth\n\n45:40.060 --> 45:41.720\n was the center of the universe\n\n45:41.720 --> 45:46.380\n and the inquisition murdered people that questioned that.\n\n45:47.240 --> 45:48.840\n Father Bruno burned at the stake.\n\n45:48.840 --> 45:50.440\n Actually, one of the things he said,\n\n45:50.440 --> 45:54.280\n I think that's worth all these years later saying\n\n45:54.280 --> 45:58.880\n is that when the inquisition sentenced him\n\n45:58.880 --> 46:02.040\n to burn at the stake for espousing this idea\n\n46:02.040 --> 46:05.720\n that the earth was not really the center of the universe,\n\n46:05.720 --> 46:08.400\n he said to the inquisition, he said,\n\n46:08.400 --> 46:11.320\n your fear in sentencing me is greater\n\n46:11.320 --> 46:13.620\n than my fear in being sentenced.\n\n46:15.280 --> 46:18.120\n That their worldview was so rigid\n\n46:18.120 --> 46:21.720\n that they had to wipe out anybody that would question it.\n\n46:21.720 --> 46:26.720\n And so this idea of psychedelics displacing our ego\n\n46:26.720 --> 46:28.640\n is the center of the universe.\n\n46:28.640 --> 46:31.320\n And to realize that we are just rotating\n\n46:31.320 --> 46:35.040\n about on something much bigger than our individual life.\n\n46:35.040 --> 46:38.520\n Our ego is designed almost to protect this body\n\n46:38.520 --> 46:40.280\n while we're alive.\n\n46:40.280 --> 46:43.080\n And you can understand all the good reasons why that is,\n\n46:44.040 --> 46:47.520\n but it also disconnects us from this bigger reality.\n\n46:47.520 --> 46:49.080\n And so the psychedelics, DMT,\n\n46:49.080 --> 46:52.480\n by knocking this sort of ego orientation\n\n46:52.480 --> 46:55.640\n or the default mode network offline,\n\n46:55.640 --> 47:00.600\n you open up to the bigger sweeps of history.\n\n47:00.600 --> 47:03.560\n So in that place of safety and vulnerability\n\n47:03.560 --> 47:06.000\n in that fascinating group of people,\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.080\n when their ego was dissolved in this way,\n\n47:08.080 --> 47:09.960\n did they have similar experiences?\n\n47:09.960 --> 47:12.240\n Is there different places that their minds went?\n\n47:12.240 --> 47:17.240\n Yeah, so once I had this kind of shattering experience\n\n47:17.460 --> 47:19.640\n that Hitler's part of me,\n\n47:19.640 --> 47:21.440\n no one else in the group had that.\n\n47:21.440 --> 47:24.080\n Probably a lot of them have maybe had that before\n\n47:24.080 --> 47:28.440\n or they realized that they're not just the good,\n\n47:28.440 --> 47:31.520\n the white hat, good people and that they're all good\n\n47:31.520 --> 47:34.560\n and we got to fight against the bad people.\n\n47:35.360 --> 47:37.200\n So no, people will go in different places.\n\n47:37.200 --> 47:39.360\n And not only that, if you do it again,\n\n47:39.360 --> 47:40.480\n you'll go into a different place\n\n47:40.480 --> 47:42.520\n than you went to the first time.\n\n47:42.520 --> 47:45.000\n Unless you have not resolved the issue.\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:48.520\n So I had a sequence of LSD trips that were very difficult,\n\n47:48.520 --> 47:52.720\n but it was like coming to the same sort of conundrum,\n\n47:52.720 --> 47:57.280\n the same challenge that I was unable to overcome.\n\n47:57.280 --> 48:00.040\n This idea of letting go and really fully dissolving,\n\n48:01.640 --> 48:02.980\n letting the ego fully go.\n\n48:02.980 --> 48:04.840\n And I would have this sequence of trips\n\n48:04.840 --> 48:07.320\n over a couple of months where I would reach this point\n\n48:07.320 --> 48:08.800\n where I was too scared to move forward\n\n48:08.800 --> 48:10.360\n and I would just be holding on.\n\n48:11.880 --> 48:15.360\n So there are repeated themes sometimes.\n\n48:15.360 --> 48:18.280\n What Stan Groff has said, which I find very beautiful,\n\n48:18.280 --> 48:21.720\n is that the full expression of an emotion\n\n48:21.720 --> 48:24.240\n is the funeral pyre of that emotion.\n\n48:25.240 --> 48:29.200\n And what that means is if you can fully let in something,\n\n48:29.200 --> 48:32.600\n then the essence of life has changed,\n\n48:32.600 --> 48:35.640\n is that it moves on, that everything's in motion.\n\n48:35.640 --> 48:37.320\n And if you can fully experience it,\n\n48:37.320 --> 48:39.400\n even if it's a sense that you're gonna be trapped\n\n48:39.400 --> 48:42.640\n in eternity in this hellish state,\n\n48:42.640 --> 48:45.140\n if you surrender to that, that's the way out.\n\n48:46.200 --> 48:48.160\n This full experience of something\n\n48:48.160 --> 48:52.220\n is this funeral pyre of that emotion.\n\n48:52.220 --> 48:54.720\n And so that runs against a lot\n\n48:54.720 --> 48:56.320\n of what modern psychiatry is doing too,\n\n48:56.320 --> 48:58.000\n which is to suppress symptoms.\n\n49:00.360 --> 49:01.640\n Instead of supporting people\n\n49:01.640 --> 49:03.920\n to kind of explore these insecurities\n\n49:03.920 --> 49:06.300\n so that then they can contain them\n\n49:06.300 --> 49:07.600\n and then they can move on.\n\n49:09.080 --> 49:13.680\n So yeah, resistance is not a way to make progress.\n\n49:13.680 --> 49:15.060\n Right, right.\n\n49:15.060 --> 49:17.860\n Although one of the reasons\n\n49:17.860 --> 49:21.380\n why we do the supplemental dose during the MDMA\n\n49:21.380 --> 49:26.140\n or why there's advantages in a 10 hour LSD experience\n\n49:26.140 --> 49:28.540\n is that you have a lot of opportunities\n\n49:28.540 --> 49:31.060\n to come up against this resistance\n\n49:31.060 --> 49:32.940\n that may be too difficult to deal with\n\n49:32.940 --> 49:34.680\n and then you kind of push it aside\n\n49:34.680 --> 49:36.580\n and then a couple hours later you come back to it\n\n49:36.580 --> 49:37.580\n or you come back to it.\n\n49:37.580 --> 49:40.500\n Press snooze every once in a while if you're not ready.\n\n49:40.500 --> 49:41.460\n It's hard to do that.\n\n49:41.460 --> 49:45.140\n I think with MDMA, you can negotiate.\n\n49:45.140 --> 49:48.140\n That's, I think, a part of its safety in a sense.\n\n49:48.140 --> 49:50.860\n You can have this like, oh, I should be talking about this\n\n49:50.860 --> 49:53.740\n or I'm feeling this, but it's too much for me now.\n\n49:53.740 --> 49:54.700\n You can push it away.\n\n49:54.700 --> 49:57.080\n But with the classic psychedelics,\n\n49:57.080 --> 49:59.500\n this kind of membrane between the conscious\n\n49:59.500 --> 50:00.940\n and the unconscious,\n\n50:00.940 --> 50:04.940\n that once you take the drug and it weakens this membrane\n\n50:04.940 --> 50:06.100\n and things are coming up,\n\n50:07.500 --> 50:10.660\n it's very difficult to negotiate with it.\n\n50:10.660 --> 50:15.660\n The key to successful classic psychedelic trips is surrender.\n\n50:18.100 --> 50:20.060\n You've talked about that you first began\n\n50:20.060 --> 50:24.260\n to reconsider the negative health myths around psychedelics\n\n50:24.260 --> 50:27.860\n when you learned that the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\n\n50:27.860 --> 50:30.580\n was written by Ken Kesey when he was in part\n\n50:30.580 --> 50:32.640\n under the influence of LSD.\n\n50:32.640 --> 50:36.180\n So how do you think LSD helped him, Ken Kesey,\n\n50:36.180 --> 50:39.540\n in writing that incredible book?\n\n50:39.540 --> 50:44.540\n Yeah, there's a process that's called semantic priming.\n\n50:45.060 --> 50:49.380\n And so what that means is that I say night, you say day.\n\n50:49.380 --> 50:52.420\n There's kind of normal patterns of kind of,\n\n50:52.420 --> 50:56.660\n you say one word, what kind of words come to you next?\n\n50:56.660 --> 50:58.500\n And so they've done some research.\n\n50:58.500 --> 51:01.280\n They, meaning scientists, have done some research\n\n51:01.280 --> 51:04.720\n where you give people a psychedelic\n\n51:04.720 --> 51:07.420\n and then you do this semantic priming.\n\n51:07.420 --> 51:12.060\n And what you find is they have a wider range of associations\n\n51:12.060 --> 51:13.340\n than they normally would\n\n51:13.340 --> 51:15.780\n when they're not under psychedelics.\n\n51:15.780 --> 51:17.840\n So I think for Ken Kesey,\n\n51:18.900 --> 51:21.980\n he was able with psychedelics to get\n\n51:24.140 --> 51:26.400\n a deeper kind of emotional connection\n\n51:26.400 --> 51:28.300\n to some of these states of mind\n\n51:28.300 --> 51:30.740\n that people were in this mental institution\n\n51:31.680 --> 51:35.580\n and that he could explore them more in depth\n\n51:35.580 --> 51:37.420\n and more eloquently.\n\n51:37.420 --> 51:40.080\n And also one of the things he talked about\n\n51:40.080 --> 51:41.840\n was the fog machine,\n\n51:41.840 --> 51:46.340\n was how people's minds were sort of clouded\n\n51:46.340 --> 51:48.440\n by the people that ran the institution\n\n51:48.440 --> 51:51.120\n and the fog machine would be coming in.\n\n51:51.120 --> 51:56.120\n So I think the imagery and the metaphors\n\n51:56.420 --> 51:58.580\n that he used a lot in the book\n\n51:58.580 --> 52:00.980\n could come to him during LSD experiences.\n\n52:00.980 --> 52:05.700\n And then now he wasn't doing very,\n\n52:05.700 --> 52:10.500\n when you're writing, you have to be literate.\n\n52:10.500 --> 52:12.520\n You have to be able to write.\n\n52:13.420 --> 52:16.320\n So it would be more like beginning and ends of LSD trips\n\n52:16.320 --> 52:17.740\n instead of at the peak.\n\n52:17.740 --> 52:19.820\n But I think you would get a lot of these,\n\n52:20.740 --> 52:23.240\n the feeling tones or the images, the metaphors,\n\n52:23.240 --> 52:26.220\n I think he would get these extent,\n\n52:26.220 --> 52:30.180\n also LSD lasts so long, you can get these extended focus\n\n52:30.180 --> 52:34.060\n and you can really elaborate on images.\n\n52:34.060 --> 52:37.860\n And so much of psychedelic experiences\n\n52:37.860 --> 52:40.420\n are poetic and metaphorical.\n\n52:40.420 --> 52:43.700\n I mean, you could take veterans\n\n52:43.700 --> 52:48.580\n who've never read a book of poetry in their lives.\n\n52:49.580 --> 52:52.020\n And under the influence of MDMA,\n\n52:52.020 --> 52:54.260\n just what they describe, the imagery\n\n52:54.260 --> 52:56.580\n and the way they describe their experiences,\n\n52:56.580 --> 53:00.500\n metaphorical, poetic, it's incredible.\n\n53:00.500 --> 53:05.500\n And so I think that Ken Kesey was able to channel\n\n53:06.460 --> 53:09.660\n what LSD did to his mind in a way\n\n53:09.660 --> 53:13.060\n that most people couldn't do,\n\n53:13.060 --> 53:15.500\n that he did because he was trying to write this novel\n\n53:15.500 --> 53:17.060\n and because he was so brilliant.\n\n53:17.940 --> 53:22.940\n Yeah, I mean, we'll talk about psychedelics\n\n53:22.940 --> 53:27.940\n and treating, in bringing some of trauma to the surface\n\n53:28.300 --> 53:29.640\n and dealing with all those kinds of things,\n\n53:29.640 --> 53:34.640\n but there's something also to the opening up of creativity\n\n53:34.780 --> 53:37.380\n for whether it's for writing purposes\n\n53:37.380 --> 53:41.940\n or for in my world for engineering, for invention,\n\n53:41.940 --> 53:44.940\n innovation and invention itself is a very,\n\n53:44.940 --> 53:47.300\n is a deeply creative process.\n\n53:47.300 --> 53:52.300\n And it's fascinating to think with the aid of psychedelics,\n\n53:53.660 --> 53:56.360\n what kind of ideas can be brought to life?\n\n53:57.300 --> 53:59.060\n Yeah, well, we have the whole phenomena\n\n53:59.060 --> 54:00.900\n of a lot of the people in Silicon Valley\n\n54:00.900 --> 54:02.680\n and else microdosing psychedelics\n\n54:02.680 --> 54:05.300\n in order to have a little touch more\n\n54:05.300 --> 54:07.620\n of this creative approach to things.\n\n54:07.620 --> 54:10.260\n I would love it to see if it was,\n\n54:10.260 --> 54:12.460\n that's more like Terrence McKenna territory,\n\n54:12.460 --> 54:13.460\n correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n54:13.460 --> 54:16.100\n but I would love to sort of more scientific\n\n54:16.100 --> 54:17.860\n to where there'll be the rigor\n\n54:17.860 --> 54:21.220\n of saying how to do it effectively,\n\n54:21.220 --> 54:26.220\n how to sort of understand sort of not just almost,\n\n54:30.820 --> 54:35.020\n to take the full journey of creative exploration\n\n54:35.020 --> 54:37.640\n and to do it for prolonged periods of time,\n\n54:39.260 --> 54:43.140\n for years, lifelong kind of part of your life\n\n54:43.140 --> 54:46.020\n of how it empowers creativity.\n\n54:46.020 --> 54:51.020\n I think, of course, you start with helping people\n\n54:53.340 --> 54:55.900\n deal with trauma, and then the next step\n\n54:55.900 --> 55:00.620\n is people who have moved past their trauma\n\n55:00.620 --> 55:02.300\n and are trying to do something,\n\n55:02.300 --> 55:04.400\n create something special in their life.\n\n55:04.400 --> 55:07.220\n How can then psychedelics empower that?\n\n55:07.220 --> 55:08.700\n Yeah, now, that also,\n\n55:08.700 --> 55:11.980\n just to not shy away from anything controversial,\n\n55:11.980 --> 55:16.980\n that gets us to this idea of psychedelics for vision quest,\n\n55:17.220 --> 55:19.420\n particularly for younger people.\n\n55:19.420 --> 55:21.660\n You know, when you're sort of moving\n\n55:21.660 --> 55:23.460\n into this adulting kind of phase\n\n55:23.460 --> 55:24.500\n and you have to figure out\n\n55:24.500 --> 55:26.300\n what are you gonna do with your life,\n\n55:27.540 --> 55:29.780\n there's so many options.\n\n55:29.780 --> 55:31.860\n A lot of people, of course, feel constrained\n\n55:31.860 --> 55:33.280\n that they have very few options,\n\n55:33.280 --> 55:36.660\n but I think this idea of psychedelics\n\n55:36.660 --> 55:40.180\n as a way to help you find your calling\n\n55:40.180 --> 55:44.240\n or find your vision or find your unique leverage point,\n\n55:44.240 --> 55:45.580\n I think we'll see that more and more\n\n55:45.580 --> 55:48.420\n as our culture evolves and gets healthier\n\n55:48.420 --> 55:49.860\n around the use of psychedelics.\n\n55:49.860 --> 55:52.420\n So it's both the science,\n\n55:52.420 --> 55:55.020\n having the rigor of understanding how to do it safely\n\n55:55.020 --> 55:56.740\n and the culture catching up\n\n55:56.740 --> 56:01.740\n to the fact that this is both safe and very useful.\n\n56:03.540 --> 56:07.580\n Yeah, although I would question this idea of safety.\n\n56:07.580 --> 56:11.340\n So we can understand physiological risks\n\n56:11.340 --> 56:13.100\n and we can minimize them.\n\n56:13.100 --> 56:16.180\n And I think there's very minimal physiological risks\n\n56:16.180 --> 56:18.460\n from the classic psychedelics, virtually none,\n\n56:18.460 --> 56:22.640\n or for even MDMA under safe conditions.\n\n56:23.740 --> 56:28.740\n Psychological risks are harder to address,\n\n56:29.660 --> 56:32.980\n but we can do that through the sense of safety and support.\n\n56:32.980 --> 56:37.520\n But I think there's a level of risk there\n\n56:37.520 --> 56:39.820\n that we shouldn't overlook.\n\n56:39.820 --> 56:42.700\n And so to make a drug into a medicine,\n\n56:42.700 --> 56:45.200\n what we have to do is prove to the satisfaction\n\n56:45.200 --> 56:47.740\n of the FDA and other regulatory agencies\n\n56:47.740 --> 56:50.360\n that things are safe and efficacious.\n\n56:50.360 --> 56:52.420\n But even though they use those words,\n\n56:52.420 --> 56:55.820\n proving safety and safe and efficacious,\n\n56:55.820 --> 56:57.940\n it's in relationship to the disease\n\n56:57.940 --> 56:59.180\n that you're trying to treat\n\n56:59.180 --> 57:01.760\n and you accept a certain amount of risk.\n\n57:01.760 --> 57:06.760\n So it's the risk benefit ratio rather than pure safety.\n\n57:06.760 --> 57:08.540\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n57:10.360 --> 57:13.560\n Let me ask you about Ken Kesey a little bit longer\n\n57:13.560 --> 57:15.220\n because fascinating him being.\n\n57:16.680 --> 57:19.760\n He was also part of Project MKUltra.\n\n57:19.760 --> 57:21.320\n Yeah, yes.\n\n57:21.320 --> 57:23.000\n What was Project MKUltra\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:26.720\n and what lessons we should take away from it?\n\n57:27.640 --> 57:32.640\n Well, MKUltra was a program by the CIA.\n\n57:33.600 --> 57:35.600\n What they were looking at was,\n\n57:35.600 --> 57:39.400\n can you take these drugs, these psychedelic drugs,\n\n57:39.400 --> 57:42.120\n and weaponize them in different ways\n\n57:43.120 --> 57:45.200\n for interrogation, for true serums,\n\n57:45.200 --> 57:49.620\n for exposing somebody before they give a big talk\n\n57:49.620 --> 57:52.460\n to something like LSD and then they can't talk\n\n57:52.460 --> 57:53.680\n or make a fool of themselves?\n\n57:53.680 --> 57:57.460\n Or can you spray LSD over the battlefield\n\n57:57.460 --> 57:59.560\n and have everybody tripping and drop their weapons\n\n57:59.560 --> 58:02.080\n and then you just walk up and nobody dies\n\n58:02.080 --> 58:04.660\n and you've won the battle?\n\n58:04.660 --> 58:07.240\n So it's a fascinating concept.\n\n58:07.240 --> 58:09.800\n Yeah, they call it nonlethal incapacitance\n\n58:09.800 --> 58:11.840\n and I think that's how it's.\n\n58:11.840 --> 58:14.680\n One way to win a war is to enforce peace.\n\n58:16.120 --> 58:19.040\n To get everybody not caring about the war, but yes.\n\n58:19.040 --> 58:21.120\n Well, I think Gandhi said something even better,\n\n58:21.120 --> 58:22.840\n which is that the true way to win a war\n\n58:22.840 --> 58:24.520\n is to turn your enemy into your friend.\n\n58:24.520 --> 58:26.520\n Yes, that's a beautiful way to put it.\n\n58:26.520 --> 58:29.920\n Yeah, but MKUltra was really nefarious\n\n58:29.920 --> 58:32.220\n and it was part of our military and it was done in secret\n\n58:32.220 --> 58:36.600\n and they would dose people against their will.\n\n58:36.600 --> 58:38.600\n I mean, one of the most infamous things\n\n58:41.400 --> 58:44.560\n was that they had a house of prostitution in San Francisco\n\n58:44.560 --> 58:47.800\n and they would have one way mirrors, all this stuff\n\n58:47.800 --> 58:50.880\n and then they would just dose people with LSD\n\n58:50.880 --> 58:53.960\n and they would have the prostitutes dose these guys with LSD\n\n58:53.960 --> 58:56.120\n and observe what they would do and how they would act.\n\n58:56.120 --> 58:58.840\n And the CIA actually for a while\n\n58:58.840 --> 59:01.580\n was dosing each other secretly\n\n59:01.580 --> 59:04.000\n and that there's a famous case of this fellow Olson\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:08.640\n that either jumped out of a window or was pushed,\n\n59:08.640 --> 59:10.560\n he might've been killed.\n\n59:10.560 --> 59:13.880\n He was a CIA guy and they gave him LSD\n\n59:13.880 --> 59:17.140\n and then they're trying to see can they break him down\n\n59:17.140 --> 59:18.480\n and get him to tell secrets.\n\n59:18.480 --> 59:21.000\n And I think he felt uncomfortable with what happened to him\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:22.560\n while he was under the influence of LSD\n\n59:22.560 --> 59:26.560\n and whether he was pushed or not,\n\n59:26.560 --> 59:28.360\n I don't know if we'll ever know.\n\n59:28.360 --> 59:33.360\n But MKUltra was violating people's human rights.\n\n59:35.160 --> 59:40.160\n It was done in secret and the irony of it\n\n59:41.720 --> 59:45.640\n is that Ken Kesey is one of the people,\n\n59:45.640 --> 59:49.240\n one of the main early people that got LSD in this context\n\n59:49.240 --> 59:51.520\n and then he was one of the main people\n\n59:51.520 --> 59:54.380\n that helped inspire the hippies to use psychedelics\n\n59:54.380 --> 59:56.160\n to oppose the Vietnam War.\n\n59:56.160 --> 1:00:01.160\n So I think the CIA kind of in many cases,\n\n1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:03.460\n things get out of their control,\n\n1:00:03.460 --> 1:00:04.480\n what they think they can do\n\n1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:08.580\n and it turned in to be a disaster for them.\n\n1:00:08.580 --> 1:00:09.840\n I think there was some thought\n\n1:00:09.840 --> 1:00:11.640\n that some of the people at the CIA had\n\n1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:14.400\n is that if you can turn people inside,\n\n1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:16.660\n take drugs and they just focus on their internal experience,\n\n1:00:16.660 --> 1:00:18.680\n they're not gonna be involved politically.\n\n1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:21.720\n It's a way to sort of take people offline.\n\n1:00:21.720 --> 1:00:23.360\n And what I don't think they counted on\n\n1:00:23.360 --> 1:00:24.600\n is that when you're offline\n\n1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:27.720\n and you have these unit of special experiences\n\n1:00:27.720 --> 1:00:29.520\n and you realize how we're all connected,\n\n1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:32.780\n then why do you wanna go out and kill these Vietnamese\n\n1:00:32.780 --> 1:00:37.780\n and put one dictator over another dictator,\n\n1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:40.840\n dictators on both sides in North Vietnam and South Vietnam?\n\n1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:42.760\n Why are we doing that?\n\n1:00:42.760 --> 1:00:47.760\n So MKUltra has just a very disreputable.\n\n1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:51.120\n We're learning more and more about what they did\n\n1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:53.920\n and one of the unintended consequences was Ken Kesey\n\n1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:56.320\n and not only that, but then the Grateful Dead\n\n1:00:56.320 --> 1:01:00.160\n who began at the acid tests that Kesey was helping\n\n1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:04.000\n to organize and out of that emerged,\n\n1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:08.680\n you could say just this incredible psychedelic culture.\n\n1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:12.720\n And you look at the bands that began in the 60s\n\n1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:17.160\n and which ones have really survived to this day\n\n1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:20.140\n and the Grateful Dead has survived longer\n\n1:01:20.140 --> 1:01:22.300\n than most any other band.\n\n1:01:22.300 --> 1:01:23.560\n I mean, some of them have died and all,\n\n1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:25.220\n but it was like the tightness,\n\n1:01:25.220 --> 1:01:27.600\n the sort of telepathy we talked about before\n\n1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:31.240\n that they could just get so tuned in to each other\n\n1:01:31.240 --> 1:01:34.080\n and each other's energies and they could do improvisations\n\n1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:36.120\n and they can do this incredible work\n\n1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:40.160\n that I think the sustainability of the Grateful Dead\n\n1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:43.880\n as a group was a testament\n\n1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:46.380\n to the power of the LSD experiences\n\n1:01:46.380 --> 1:01:48.880\n and that might've never happened if not for MKUltra.\n\n1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:53.880\n But can we talk about the darkness a little bit?\n\n1:01:56.160 --> 1:01:59.800\n So Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber was allegedly part\n\n1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:03.680\n of the MKUltra studies while at Harvard.\n\n1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:05.160\n Do you think this is true?\n\n1:02:05.160 --> 1:02:06.440\n Do you think it had an impact\n\n1:02:06.440 --> 1:02:09.520\n on him psychologically, intellectually and so on?\n\n1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:12.200\n I do think it's true and I do think it had an impact.\n\n1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:16.320\n So we talked before about are these drugs somehow\n\n1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:20.200\n or other producing a certain kind of drug experience\n\n1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:23.040\n or do they bring out what's within?\n\n1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:26.040\n So we have this experience, yeah, on the one hand,\n\n1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:30.020\n Ken Kesey and he sort of took positive things out of this.\n\n1:02:30.020 --> 1:02:35.020\n On the other hand, we can get this opposition\n\n1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:38.400\n to the modern world, to technology\n\n1:02:38.400 --> 1:02:42.180\n and to the point of creating bombs to try to go after it.\n\n1:02:42.180 --> 1:02:45.360\n So that the experience is not in the drug,\n\n1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:48.280\n it's this interaction between the drug,\n\n1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:50.580\n the person, the context.\n\n1:02:50.580 --> 1:02:55.580\n And so we can heal people with psychedelics\n\n1:02:55.720 --> 1:02:58.500\n or people can be driven crazy with psychedelics.\n\n1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:01.920\n It depends again on the context.\n\n1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:05.360\n And so I think both these things can be true.\n\n1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:06.560\n And I think it was really good\n\n1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:08.120\n that you kind of highlighted this,\n\n1:03:08.120 --> 1:03:13.040\n that there is this polarities and that it's not in the drug,\n\n1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:17.200\n it's in the other factors and it's who they were beforehand\n\n1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:19.000\n and then how you use that experience.\n\n1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.240\n So all that's to say is if we put LSD in the water\n\n1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:23.840\n and everybody were to get it,\n\n1:03:23.840 --> 1:03:25.280\n it doesn't mean that all of a sudden\n\n1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:27.000\n everybody's gonna have a mystical experience\n\n1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.320\n and then that's all we need to do\n\n1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:32.600\n and humanity is spiritualized or end war and all of this.\n\n1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:35.520\n It's not about the drug.\n\n1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:38.960\n And that actually is why for me,\n\n1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:43.000\n we've also talked about engineering new psychedelics\n\n1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:44.920\n and all the people that are gonna be trying\n\n1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:48.040\n for profit companies to develop and patent new psychedelics.\n\n1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:50.240\n For me, the most important challenge\n\n1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:55.240\n is new cultural contexts that can create legality,\n\n1:03:55.640 --> 1:03:59.320\n safety, support for the existing psychedelics\n\n1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:00.960\n that we already have.\n\n1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:04.480\n I mean, we have so much incredible tools\n\n1:04:04.480 --> 1:04:06.320\n in these existing psychedelics\n\n1:04:06.320 --> 1:04:09.840\n that it's more about creating context for them\n\n1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:12.680\n to be used in safe medical or personal growth\n\n1:04:12.680 --> 1:04:14.640\n or recreational even with harm reduction,\n\n1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:15.480\n all these different ways.\n\n1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:18.560\n That's more important to me than finding some new molecule\n\n1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:20.520\n that's somewhat similar or somewhat different\n\n1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:22.560\n but it can be patented.\n\n1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:24.440\n So it's the social context.\n\n1:04:24.440 --> 1:04:28.880\n So I do believe that Ted Kaczynski was part of NKUltra\n\n1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:31.840\n and I think it affected him in a negative way\n\n1:04:31.840 --> 1:04:36.120\n and that's a cautionary tale that it's not in the drug,\n\n1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:37.520\n it's in the context.\n\n1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:42.520\n The context, the person, still it feels like if viewed\n\n1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:47.760\n from a therapy perspective, perhaps there was a way\n\n1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:52.680\n to use psychedelics to help Ted Kaczynski find a path\n\n1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:53.960\n out of the darkness.\n\n1:04:53.960 --> 1:04:58.640\n I think so and I think that this is where I think MDMA\n\n1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:03.640\n comes in in a way that MDMA is, he felt very isolated\n\n1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:08.000\n and very much out of society in some ways.\n\n1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:12.200\n MDMA stimulates oxytocin, which we haven't mentioned,\n\n1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:14.080\n which is the hormone of nursing mothers,\n\n1:05:14.080 --> 1:05:15.680\n of love and connection.\n\n1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:18.800\n It provides a lot of this sense of self acceptance\n\n1:05:18.800 --> 1:05:21.560\n and safety and wanting to be in a relationship.\n\n1:05:21.560 --> 1:05:24.920\n There's Gould Dolan is a neuroscientist at Hopkins.\n\n1:05:24.920 --> 1:05:29.920\n She's given octopuses MDMA, they're solitary creatures\n\n1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:32.920\n except mating season, which is not very often\n\n1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:35.240\n but you give them MDMA and they become more interested\n\n1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:37.480\n in hanging out with other octopuses.\n\n1:05:37.480 --> 1:05:40.960\n So I think this, for people that have had difficult\n\n1:05:40.960 --> 1:05:45.200\n psychedelic experiences, MDMA helps them integrate them.\n\n1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:48.640\n We've worked with people that had a difficult LSD experience\n\n1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:52.240\n 40 years before and are still able to get back to that\n\n1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:54.480\n under the influence of MDMA and work out some\n\n1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:57.400\n of the conflicts that they weren't able to resolve\n\n1:05:58.680 --> 1:06:00.320\n all those decades before.\n\n1:06:00.320 --> 1:06:04.720\n So I think that psychedelics could have been helpful\n\n1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:07.720\n in a different context for Ted Kaczynski.\n\n1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:11.840\n But the other big part of it is that people have to be\n\n1:06:11.840 --> 1:06:14.200\n willing to cooperate with the experience.\n\n1:06:14.200 --> 1:06:16.120\n We talked about resistance.\n\n1:06:16.120 --> 1:06:18.000\n So people can resist these things.\n\n1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:21.440\n It's the saying is you can bring a horse to water\n\n1:06:21.440 --> 1:06:22.920\n but you can't make them drink.\n\n1:06:22.920 --> 1:06:25.400\n This is about how people have to be willing\n\n1:06:25.400 --> 1:06:26.920\n to go to these spaces.\n\n1:06:26.920 --> 1:06:30.180\n So one of the essence of our therapeutic approach\n\n1:06:30.180 --> 1:06:33.640\n is that we help people to heal themselves,\n\n1:06:33.640 --> 1:06:36.560\n that we are not giving them the healing.\n\n1:06:36.560 --> 1:06:40.800\n It's a flip on the power dynamics that existed,\n\n1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:43.120\n you would say in the fifties and sixties,\n\n1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:45.520\n my dad was a doctor and the doctors were gods\n\n1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:47.600\n and whatever they said was right.\n\n1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:50.180\n And we no longer, of course, believe that.\n\n1:06:50.180 --> 1:06:54.400\n But for a while, psychoanalysis with Freud,\n\n1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:56.920\n that they gave the interpretation to the patient.\n\n1:06:56.920 --> 1:06:58.200\n The patient couldn't help themselves\n\n1:06:58.200 --> 1:06:59.840\n but they would do the free associations\n\n1:06:59.840 --> 1:07:02.280\n and the psychoanalyst would see these conflicts\n\n1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:04.960\n and would be the one that does the healing,\n\n1:07:04.960 --> 1:07:07.680\n would give this interpretation and that would open things up.\n\n1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:11.000\n So I think it's this idea of empowering people\n\n1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:12.860\n to heal themselves.\n\n1:07:12.860 --> 1:07:16.600\n And so if Ted Kuznicki had been in a therapeutic setting\n\n1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:19.800\n with psychedelics and if they'd had something\n\n1:07:19.800 --> 1:07:23.760\n like MDMA available or MDA,\n\n1:07:23.760 --> 1:07:25.520\n which was popular during the sixties,\n\n1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:28.160\n which is a more like MDMA LSD combination,\n\n1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:31.700\n the outcomes might've been different.\n\n1:07:31.700 --> 1:07:34.340\n Let's take a step into the world of studies.\n\n1:07:35.700 --> 1:07:38.660\n Timothy Leary, who was he\n\n1:07:38.660 --> 1:07:41.500\n and what were the most important ideas\n\n1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:43.460\n you've learned from him?\n\n1:07:43.460 --> 1:07:48.300\n Well, I did have the opportunity to get to know him personally\n\n1:07:48.300 --> 1:07:50.300\n and to spend some time with him.\n\n1:07:50.300 --> 1:07:55.300\n Timothy Leary, well, let's start with Nixon saying\n\n1:07:55.300 --> 1:07:58.640\n he's the most dangerous man in America.\n\n1:07:58.640 --> 1:08:00.520\n That's a good place to start.\n\n1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:01.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:08:01.720 --> 1:08:03.360\n And why did Nixon say that?\n\n1:08:03.360 --> 1:08:08.360\n It's because of this turn on, tune in, drop out.\n\n1:08:11.640 --> 1:08:14.320\n Timothy Leary was just an incredible advocate\n\n1:08:14.320 --> 1:08:18.800\n for think for yourself, question authority.\n\n1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:19.960\n Those were the things he said all the time.\n\n1:08:19.960 --> 1:08:21.480\n Think for yourself, question authority.\n\n1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:23.080\n He was a rebel.\n\n1:08:23.080 --> 1:08:25.440\n He was kicked out of West Point.\n\n1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:30.440\n He was a psychologist who was at Harvard for three years\n\n1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:32.600\n from 60 to 63.\n\n1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:35.760\n Before he got to Harvard,\n\n1:08:35.760 --> 1:08:39.760\n he had an experience with mushrooms in Mexico.\n\n1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:44.840\n And he said he learned more in that experience\n\n1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:47.320\n than he'd had in his entire academic career before then\n\n1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:49.300\n about how the human mind works.\n\n1:08:49.300 --> 1:08:53.480\n And so he came to Harvard wanting to do research\n\n1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:54.620\n into psychedelics.\n\n1:08:56.600 --> 1:09:01.200\n And he did some very important studies, both of which,\n\n1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:03.520\n well, one was called the Good Friday Experiment,\n\n1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:06.920\n which was whether psychedelics in religiously inclined\n\n1:09:06.920 --> 1:09:09.860\n people taking psilocybin in a religious setting,\n\n1:09:09.860 --> 1:09:12.060\n whether it could produce a mystical experience.\n\n1:09:12.060 --> 1:09:15.140\n That took place at Marsh Chapel at the Boston University.\n\n1:09:15.140 --> 1:09:18.000\n Because it's a little bit subjective,\n\n1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:19.600\n where you can say entirely subjective,\n\n1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:23.000\n what people describe happens to them.\n\n1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:24.800\n He wanted to do another study,\n\n1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:26.640\n which would be a more objective measure,\n\n1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:28.640\n and that was called the Concord Prison Experiment.\n\n1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:30.880\n And that was the thought, if you can give people\n\n1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:35.740\n psilocybin mystical sense of connection type experiences\n\n1:09:35.740 --> 1:09:38.000\n while they're in prison, when they get out,\n\n1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:41.120\n they'll be more pro social and they'll have reduced\n\n1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:41.960\n recidivism.\n\n1:09:43.340 --> 1:09:44.440\n So Tim did that.\n\n1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:46.560\n He also did the naturalistic studies\n\n1:09:46.560 --> 1:09:48.140\n of giving loads of people psilocybin\n\n1:09:48.140 --> 1:09:50.500\n and sort of writing down what their experiences were,\n\n1:09:50.500 --> 1:09:52.400\n the range of experiences.\n\n1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:56.720\n Later on in his time at Harvard,\n\n1:09:56.720 --> 1:09:58.900\n they started doing LSD.\n\n1:09:58.900 --> 1:10:02.280\n And LSD is more cerebral, longer lasting,\n\n1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:04.920\n not as reassuring in a way as psilocybin.\n\n1:10:04.920 --> 1:10:08.680\n Sometimes he used to say that if they never got into LSD,\n\n1:10:08.680 --> 1:10:12.480\n they'd still be at Harvard with the psilocybin.\n\n1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:14.820\n So he was a great American psychologist,\n\n1:10:14.820 --> 1:10:19.680\n but then he got tired of the psychology game,\n\n1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:22.040\n you could say, or he would say that.\n\n1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:27.040\n He got more and more interested in cultural change\n\n1:10:27.700 --> 1:10:30.640\n and various musicians and artists\n\n1:10:30.640 --> 1:10:32.160\n and all sorts of people started coming to him\n\n1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:34.720\n for the psychedelic experience that they are in a way\n\n1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:36.240\n for creativity, for other things.\n\n1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:40.680\n So he started hanging out with all sorts of famous people\n\n1:10:40.680 --> 1:10:45.680\n or creative people and he stopped going to classes a lot.\n\n1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:52.200\n And Ram Dass, Richard Alpert had given LSD to a student\n\n1:10:54.920 --> 1:10:59.640\n that Ram Dass was courageous enough to admit\n\n1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:02.560\n that he had a sexual interest in.\n\n1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:04.440\n They weren't supposed to give it undergraduates.\n\n1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:06.320\n That was about the only time that they ever did it.\n\n1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:09.980\n And psychedelics just getting more and more controversial\n\n1:11:09.980 --> 1:11:13.320\n even in the early 60s, eventually got kicked out of Harvard\n\n1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:16.280\n and then he became kind of a cultural icon\n\n1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:21.280\n for the counterculture and was hounded by the police\n\n1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:24.880\n and Nixon and spent a lot of time in jail.\n\n1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:26.780\n I mean, he's an incredible person.\n\n1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:33.160\n One thing that Ram Dass said is that Richard Alpert,\n\n1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:37.280\n Ram Dass said, I'm a rascal, but Leary's a scoundrel.\n\n1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:39.880\n What's the distinction?\n\n1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:41.560\n Rascals like in good fun.\n\n1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:45.260\n A scoundrel is like, you can't quite trust them, I think.\n\n1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:48.200\n I think that.\n\n1:11:48.200 --> 1:11:50.040\n It's a spectrum of sorts.\n\n1:11:50.040 --> 1:11:52.120\n Yeah, I think that Leary was someone\n\n1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:55.560\n who a little bit got addicted to media attention.\n\n1:11:57.160 --> 1:12:01.280\n But I think that overall he gets blamed a lot\n\n1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:04.000\n for the backlash against the 60s,\n\n1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:05.680\n the shutdown of psychedelic research.\n\n1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:08.740\n I think that he is unfairly blamed for a lot of that.\n\n1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:12.400\n I think when you look back at the 60s,\n\n1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:15.800\n the common narrative is that it was\n\n1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:17.760\n because psychedelics going wrong.\n\n1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:19.580\n People took psychedelics, they weren't prepared,\n\n1:12:19.580 --> 1:12:21.780\n they had emotional breakdowns, they weren't psychotic,\n\n1:12:21.780 --> 1:12:24.280\n they killed themselves, they did this or that,\n\n1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:27.120\n different problems of people taking psychedelics\n\n1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:31.540\n in context that they didn't feel fairly safe in\n\n1:12:31.540 --> 1:12:33.020\n or just they weren't prepared\n\n1:12:33.020 --> 1:12:34.480\n or they didn't know how much they were taking\n\n1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:35.320\n or all this.\n\n1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:39.440\n So the backlash was because psychedelics going wrong.\n\n1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:42.680\n But I think the real reason, while that did happen,\n\n1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:45.560\n I think the real reason is psychedelics going right\n\n1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:48.160\n and people having this sense of connection.\n\n1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:50.960\n And then the opposite of what the CIA was hoping\n\n1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:54.240\n that it would kind of turn people inward\n\n1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:56.320\n and take them away from political struggles,\n\n1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:58.960\n it actually motivated people.\n\n1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:02.200\n Once you actually have these psychedelic experiences,\n\n1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:05.040\n your attitude towards death changes also\n\n1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:09.080\n this idea of death becoming an intrinsic part of life,\n\n1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:12.160\n it's a natural cycle, it's not so much.\n\n1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:15.560\n So I think people realize that,\n\n1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:18.840\n while there's this billions of years of evolution,\n\n1:13:18.840 --> 1:13:21.420\n infinity, whatever that means in terms of time,\n\n1:13:21.420 --> 1:13:22.920\n that we're here for a very limited time\n\n1:13:22.920 --> 1:13:24.800\n and they end up wanting to use their time well,\n\n1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:26.720\n they have a lessened fear of death\n\n1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:29.800\n and they wanna build this paradise on earth here now\n\n1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:31.200\n instead of later.\n\n1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:35.200\n So a lot of people really did get motivated\n\n1:13:35.200 --> 1:13:36.880\n to challenge the Vietnam War,\n\n1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:38.440\n to work on the environmental movement,\n\n1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:40.560\n civil rights movement, women's rights movement,\n\n1:13:40.560 --> 1:13:42.320\n anti militarism.\n\n1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:44.640\n And it was that challenge to the status quo\n\n1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:46.360\n that caused the backlash.\n\n1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:50.540\n So Leary is someone who in 1990,\n\n1:13:50.540 --> 1:13:52.960\n we had the maps I started in 86.\n\n1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:56.040\n So in 1990, we had this conference\n\n1:13:56.040 --> 1:13:57.760\n to raise money out in California\n\n1:13:57.760 --> 1:13:59.600\n and Leary was there and Ram Dass was there\n\n1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:01.760\n and Ralph Metzner was there and Andy Weil was there\n\n1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:02.840\n and Terrence McKenna was there\n\n1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:04.800\n and Dennis McKenna was there and all these.\n\n1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:09.800\n But there was one point where Tim was speaking\n\n1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:11.920\n and afterwards I was asking him some questions.\n\n1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:15.240\n And I said, do you have any advice for us\n\n1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:17.120\n on how to work with the government\n\n1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:19.600\n and how to bring these psychedelics forward?\n\n1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:20.760\n That's what we're trying to do.\n\n1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:22.720\n I've got this nonprofit for it.\n\n1:14:22.720 --> 1:14:23.980\n We're trying to do this research.\n\n1:14:23.980 --> 1:14:27.080\n What is your advice on how to bring this forward\n\n1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:29.280\n and how to work with the government?\n\n1:14:29.280 --> 1:14:31.920\n And he said, fuck the government.\n\n1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:36.440\n He said, I am so far past asking for permission\n\n1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:40.720\n for anything, but I'm glad that you're doing it.\n\n1:14:40.720 --> 1:14:44.040\n And then he held up my hand like passing the torch.\n\n1:14:44.040 --> 1:14:47.400\n So it was, and that's one of my favorite photographs\n\n1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:48.880\n of me and Tim where he's sort of like,\n\n1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:50.680\n but it was after this, fuck the government.\n\n1:14:50.680 --> 1:14:53.160\n I'm so far past asking for permission for anything,\n\n1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:54.840\n but I'm glad that you are.\n\n1:14:54.840 --> 1:14:57.760\n Now I did follow ups to the Good Friday experiment\n\n1:14:57.760 --> 1:14:59.880\n and I did follow ups, 25 year follow up\n\n1:14:59.880 --> 1:15:01.040\n to the Good Friday experiment,\n\n1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:02.420\n about a 34 year follow up\n\n1:15:02.420 --> 1:15:04.240\n to the Concord Prison experiment.\n\n1:15:05.880 --> 1:15:08.200\n What I discovered in some ways I would say\n\n1:15:08.200 --> 1:15:10.400\n is the key to the 60s, what I just told you,\n\n1:15:10.400 --> 1:15:12.820\n but in the follow up to the Good Friday experiment\n\n1:15:12.820 --> 1:15:16.100\n that I did in the 80s for my undergraduate thesis\n\n1:15:16.100 --> 1:15:18.640\n at New College in Sarasota, Florida,\n\n1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:21.040\n I eventually found 19 out of the 20 people.\n\n1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:23.620\n It was just, that was an enormous challenge\n\n1:15:23.620 --> 1:15:24.960\n because their names were all lost\n\n1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:27.320\n and it just took forever years and years and years\n\n1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:28.160\n to find them all.\n\n1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:30.640\n But I discovered that those people\n\n1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:32.200\n that had the psilocybin experience\n\n1:15:32.200 --> 1:15:35.900\n in the midst of 25 years later with Nancy Reagan\n\n1:15:35.900 --> 1:15:38.260\n and Ronald Reagan, and if there ever were there\n\n1:15:38.260 --> 1:15:41.160\n a social pressure to disavow the validity\n\n1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:43.960\n of the psychedelic experience, that was then.\n\n1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:47.120\n And instead they affirmed it,\n\n1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:51.120\n that they thought with all of this years of hindsight,\n\n1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:52.380\n now looking back, they thought it was\n\n1:15:52.380 --> 1:15:53.920\n a valid mystical experience.\n\n1:15:53.920 --> 1:15:57.840\n But I discovered that one of the persons\n\n1:15:59.240 --> 1:16:03.680\n who had the psilocybin had this experience\n\n1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:05.680\n during the Good Friday service\n\n1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:09.080\n that Reverend Howard Thurman was the minister.\n\n1:16:09.080 --> 1:16:11.040\n He was Martin Luther King's mentor\n\n1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:12.800\n and Reverend Howard Thurman was the minister\n\n1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:15.300\n at Boston at Marsh Chapel.\n\n1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:20.480\n Martin Luther King got his PhD at Boston University.\n\n1:16:20.480 --> 1:16:24.320\n And Howard Thurman had spent time with Gandhi.\n\n1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:26.820\n And so he was really kind of this hidden person\n\n1:16:26.820 --> 1:16:28.260\n behind the civil rights movement\n\n1:16:28.260 --> 1:16:31.120\n about nonviolence as their strategy.\n\n1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:33.600\n But he was interested in the political implications\n\n1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:34.540\n of the mystical experience.\n\n1:16:34.540 --> 1:16:37.600\n So he permitted this experiment to take place.\n\n1:16:37.600 --> 1:16:39.520\n And there were 20 divinity students\n\n1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:41.180\n from Andover Newton in the basement\n\n1:16:41.180 --> 1:16:44.060\n and 10 experimenters, all the people on religion\n\n1:16:44.060 --> 1:16:47.840\n and psychology, like Houston Smith and Walter Huston Clarke\n\n1:16:47.840 --> 1:16:50.520\n and Leary and Ramdas, Mr. Others were there\n\n1:16:50.520 --> 1:16:51.980\n as a support part of it.\n\n1:16:51.980 --> 1:16:54.520\n And the sermon was like three hours later.\n\n1:16:54.520 --> 1:16:56.440\n We actually have, three hours long,\n\n1:16:56.440 --> 1:16:58.560\n we actually have the original sermon\n\n1:16:58.560 --> 1:16:59.880\n from the Good Friday experiment\n\n1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:02.240\n from Howard Thurman up on our website.\n\n1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:03.320\n It's incredible.\n\n1:17:03.320 --> 1:17:06.280\n But part of it was tell people there's a man on the cross.\n\n1:17:06.280 --> 1:17:09.280\n And this one person sort of heard that\n\n1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:11.240\n and he thought, okay, I gotta do that.\n\n1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:14.160\n Howard Thurman was such a dynamic speaker.\n\n1:17:14.160 --> 1:17:16.780\n He said, I gotta tell people there's a man on the cross.\n\n1:17:16.780 --> 1:17:18.180\n And so he said, what am I doing here\n\n1:17:18.180 --> 1:17:20.720\n in this basement chapel listening to this service?\n\n1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:22.200\n I gotta go tell people there's a man on the cross.\n\n1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:24.540\n So he went, they thought he was just going to the bathroom,\n\n1:17:24.540 --> 1:17:25.380\n but he ran out the door.\n\n1:17:25.380 --> 1:17:27.480\n He's running down Commonwealth Avenue\n\n1:17:27.480 --> 1:17:31.440\n and Houston Smith and Tim Leary go after him.\n\n1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:34.560\n And he had thought that since he should tell somebody,\n\n1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:38.320\n he should tell the president, like why not?\n\n1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:40.380\n But then he realized, well, the president's in Washington.\n\n1:17:40.380 --> 1:17:42.400\n I'm here in Boston.\n\n1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:44.320\n I'll just tell the president of the university.\n\n1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:46.120\n So anyway, he's running down the street\n\n1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:48.800\n and Leary and Houston Smith go after him.\n\n1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:50.120\n And he doesn't want to go back inside.\n\n1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:50.960\n They finally get him.\n\n1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:51.860\n He's not hit by a car,\n\n1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:55.960\n but they end up giving him a shot of Thorazine.\n\n1:17:57.280 --> 1:17:58.200\n What's Thorazine?\n\n1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:02.240\n Thorazine is like a major antipsychotic drug.\n\n1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:07.020\n It's a horrible drug, but it knocks people out,\n\n1:18:07.020 --> 1:18:08.680\n tranquilizes them.\n\n1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:10.120\n We would never do that today.\n\n1:18:11.060 --> 1:18:14.280\n We don't abort a difficult experience like that.\n\n1:18:14.280 --> 1:18:15.620\n But in any case, they hid that.\n\n1:18:15.620 --> 1:18:20.040\n That was not part of the writeup of this experiment.\n\n1:18:20.040 --> 1:18:22.320\n So what they did is in a sense,\n\n1:18:22.320 --> 1:18:24.640\n a little bit exaggerated the benefits.\n\n1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:27.340\n It later became out three years later after the experiment\n\n1:18:27.340 --> 1:18:28.680\n or four years in Time Magazine,\n\n1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:30.400\n it said everybody that got psilocybin\n\n1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:32.400\n had a mystical experience.\n\n1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:34.060\n Say it wasn't true, not everybody.\n\n1:18:34.060 --> 1:18:37.520\n Eight out of the 10 did, but not all 10, not this guy.\n\n1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:40.960\n And they minimize the risks.\n\n1:18:40.960 --> 1:18:41.960\n So there was a bit of that.\n\n1:18:41.960 --> 1:18:43.960\n I think Tim was reckless in that way.\n\n1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:48.440\n It was underplayed the risks and overpromised the benefits.\n\n1:18:48.440 --> 1:18:51.240\n And then the Concord Prison experiment,\n\n1:18:51.240 --> 1:18:56.000\n it turned out that Tim had fudged the data completely\n\n1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:57.920\n and it wasn't really successful.\n\n1:18:57.920 --> 1:19:00.360\n So I fault him for that.\n\n1:19:00.360 --> 1:19:02.320\n The outside world was doing the opposite.\n\n1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:06.160\n It was exaggerating the risks and blocking research.\n\n1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:09.360\n So he felt justified to fudge the data\n\n1:19:09.360 --> 1:19:12.280\n because the outside world was fudging in a sense,\n\n1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:13.920\n the response to the.\n\n1:19:13.920 --> 1:19:15.280\n Yeah, yeah, exactly.\n\n1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:20.280\n Yeah, so that presents a very nice context.\n\n1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:24.600\n Fuck the government, but I'm glad that somebody\n\n1:19:26.200 --> 1:19:28.520\n is fighting the good fight from within\n\n1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:32.920\n and doing it the right way, which is where you are.\n\n1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:37.920\n So the 80s, let me ask, what is MAPS,\n\n1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:42.000\n the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies\n\n1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:45.240\n and what is its mission throughout the years,\n\n1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:46.360\n throughout the decades?\n\n1:19:46.360 --> 1:19:49.960\n Yeah, so MAPS is a nonprofit organization.\n\n1:19:49.960 --> 1:19:52.980\n I created it as a nonprofit pharmaceutical company.\n\n1:19:53.920 --> 1:19:57.180\n I created it in 86 after DEA,\n\n1:19:57.180 --> 1:19:58.760\n the Drug Enforcement Administration,\n\n1:19:58.760 --> 1:20:01.560\n criminalized MDMA in 1985.\n\n1:20:01.560 --> 1:20:05.800\n And that was after they started trying to do that in 1984.\n\n1:20:05.800 --> 1:20:09.640\n And as I mentioned, this Terence McKenna is sponsoring,\n\n1:20:09.640 --> 1:20:12.280\n motivating us to do this safety study.\n\n1:20:12.280 --> 1:20:15.440\n So we did that in preparation for this eventual crackdown\n\n1:20:15.440 --> 1:20:18.960\n because MDMA was called Adam, used as a therapy drug,\n\n1:20:18.960 --> 1:20:21.760\n but it was also beginning to be sold as ecstasy\n\n1:20:21.760 --> 1:20:22.600\n as a party drug.\n\n1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:25.560\n And that was taking place in public settings and bars.\n\n1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:29.000\n And so it was inevitable that the crackdown would happen.\n\n1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:32.760\n And so I had a nonprofit connected to Buckminster Fuller,\n\n1:20:32.760 --> 1:20:35.100\n Earth Metabolic Design Lab,\n\n1:20:35.100 --> 1:20:38.680\n that we used to support this lawsuit against the DEA\n\n1:20:38.680 --> 1:20:41.160\n to block them from criminalizing MDMA.\n\n1:20:41.160 --> 1:20:43.520\n We were winning in the court of public opinion\n\n1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:45.120\n and winning in the court.\n\n1:20:45.120 --> 1:20:46.280\n The DEA freaked out\n\n1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:49.680\n and the emergency scheduled MDMA in 85.\n\n1:20:49.680 --> 1:20:51.040\n The handwriting was on the wall\n\n1:20:51.040 --> 1:20:52.520\n that they were not gonna permit\n\n1:20:52.520 --> 1:20:54.280\n the therapeutic use to continue\n\n1:20:54.280 --> 1:20:56.480\n because it gets in the way of the narrative of the drug war\n\n1:20:56.480 --> 1:20:58.320\n and these are terrible drugs.\n\n1:20:58.320 --> 1:21:02.760\n So in 86 is when I started MAPS as a nonprofit pharma\n\n1:21:02.760 --> 1:21:05.600\n because the strategy that I realized is that\n\n1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:09.540\n Americans are open to medicines,\n\n1:21:10.420 --> 1:21:13.100\n that tools to ease suffering,\n\n1:21:13.100 --> 1:21:14.540\n that was the opening wedge,\n\n1:21:14.540 --> 1:21:17.300\n the opening door to changing attitudes.\n\n1:21:17.300 --> 1:21:18.740\n And it would be through science.\n\n1:21:18.740 --> 1:21:21.700\n I would say that my religion is more science\n\n1:21:21.700 --> 1:21:23.260\n than anything else.\n\n1:21:23.260 --> 1:21:28.260\n And culture and religion are metaphorical,\n\n1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:31.040\n but often too much they become literal.\n\n1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:34.400\n But I felt that through science, through medicine,\n\n1:21:34.400 --> 1:21:36.820\n there would be a way to bring these drugs\n\n1:21:36.820 --> 1:21:37.900\n back to the surface.\n\n1:21:37.900 --> 1:21:42.340\n And the mission was always this mass mental health,\n\n1:21:42.340 --> 1:21:46.660\n this idea that what we need is to spiritualize humanity.\n\n1:21:46.660 --> 1:21:49.180\n Einstein said the splitting of the atom\n\n1:21:49.180 --> 1:21:52.240\n has changed everything except our mode of thinking.\n\n1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:56.220\n And hence we drift towards unparalleled catastrophe,\n\n1:21:56.220 --> 1:21:59.300\n which shall be required if mankind is to survive\n\n1:21:59.300 --> 1:22:01.180\n is a whole new mode of thinking.\n\n1:22:01.180 --> 1:22:04.420\n So what is that new mode of thinking?\n\n1:22:05.560 --> 1:22:10.560\n My presumption is that it's more of this mystical sense\n\n1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:12.920\n of thinking that we're all connected.\n\n1:22:12.920 --> 1:22:14.800\n And then if we realize that we're all connected,\n\n1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:16.360\n we're not gonna blow up the world.\n\n1:22:16.360 --> 1:22:20.080\n So a lot of people say that if we could just give LSD\n\n1:22:20.080 --> 1:22:22.920\n all to the world leaders, that would be,\n\n1:22:22.920 --> 1:22:24.520\n then they'd have these spiritual experiences,\n\n1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:25.360\n the world would be better.\n\n1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:27.200\n But I actually had a ketamine experience\n\n1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:29.600\n the day after that DMT experience I described\n\n1:22:29.600 --> 1:22:31.480\n with the inner Hitler.\n\n1:22:31.480 --> 1:22:34.520\n This ketamine experience was,\n\n1:22:34.520 --> 1:22:37.280\n I was above and behind Hitler as he was giving a speech,\n\n1:22:37.280 --> 1:22:40.220\n like the Nuremberg rallies kind of thing.\n\n1:22:40.220 --> 1:22:42.280\n And I was trying to think, how do I get into his head?\n\n1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:44.560\n How do I undo what he wants to do?\n\n1:22:44.560 --> 1:22:46.280\n How can we deal with him?\n\n1:22:46.280 --> 1:22:48.960\n And I realized this whole new thing\n\n1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:50.520\n about the Heil Hitler salute.\n\n1:22:50.520 --> 1:22:53.240\n And he would like push energy out\n\n1:22:53.240 --> 1:22:55.600\n and then everybody would do the salute back to him.\n\n1:22:55.600 --> 1:22:57.180\n And so it's like the one to the many\n\n1:22:57.180 --> 1:22:58.020\n and the many to the one,\n\n1:22:58.020 --> 1:23:00.040\n giving all these people giving away their power\n\n1:23:00.040 --> 1:23:03.240\n and then how it would just sort of ratchet up in intensity\n\n1:23:03.240 --> 1:23:04.960\n like these vibrations.\n\n1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:07.480\n And I realized there's no way to get into his head.\n\n1:23:07.480 --> 1:23:08.800\n This idea we've talked about before\n\n1:23:08.800 --> 1:23:10.980\n about you have to be willing.\n\n1:23:10.980 --> 1:23:13.680\n So what that sort of helped me understand\n\n1:23:13.680 --> 1:23:16.800\n is that the strategy has to be mass mental health.\n\n1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:18.540\n It's not about changing a few leaders.\n\n1:23:18.540 --> 1:23:21.280\n We need to change the mass of humanity\n\n1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:24.280\n to this new mode of thinking, this new spiritual way.\n\n1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:28.680\n So MAPS was a nonprofit pharmaceutical company\n\n1:23:28.680 --> 1:23:30.600\n focused on psychedelics.\n\n1:23:30.600 --> 1:23:32.120\n Big Pharma wasn't doing this work.\n\n1:23:32.120 --> 1:23:33.920\n Government wasn't funding it.\n\n1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:35.160\n So the only source of funds\n\n1:23:35.160 --> 1:23:37.200\n I thought would be through nonprofit donations.\n\n1:23:37.200 --> 1:23:39.160\n And that's been true up until just a couple of years ago\n\n1:23:39.160 --> 1:23:41.440\n now that we have the rise of these for profits.\n\n1:23:41.440 --> 1:23:42.560\n But that's because we've cleared out\n\n1:23:42.560 --> 1:23:45.000\n the regulatory obstacles.\n\n1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:47.600\n We've got more scientific data about the benefits\n\n1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:49.320\n funded through philanthropy.\n\n1:23:49.320 --> 1:23:51.240\n We've changed public opinion\n\n1:23:51.240 --> 1:23:53.840\n and there's a lot less zeal for the drug war.\n\n1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:55.280\n So all of those things have changed.\n\n1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:58.960\n But at the time it was mass mental health was the goal.\n\n1:23:58.960 --> 1:24:01.600\n Two tracks, one was drug development,\n\n1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:03.800\n the other was drug policy reform.\n\n1:24:03.800 --> 1:24:05.960\n So then it's not just available to people\n\n1:24:05.960 --> 1:24:07.360\n that have a clinical diagnosis,\n\n1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:10.560\n but people who are personal growth\n\n1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:13.960\n or they should have access to it as well.\n\n1:24:13.960 --> 1:24:16.560\n I did not know at the time that no drug\n\n1:24:16.560 --> 1:24:19.200\n had ever been made into a medicine by a nonprofit.\n\n1:24:20.480 --> 1:24:23.160\n That was really good I didn't know that.\n\n1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:26.040\n I might've been a little bit more daunted.\n\n1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:28.440\n And actually that didn't happen for 13 more years.\n\n1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:30.600\n It happened in 1999.\n\n1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:34.200\n And that was the abortion pill, RU46,\n\n1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:36.760\n that was approved in Europe, but it's controversial.\n\n1:24:36.760 --> 1:24:39.400\n Nobody, no pharmaceutical company would take it.\n\n1:24:39.400 --> 1:24:41.480\n And it was John D. Rockefeller the third\n\n1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:42.760\n through the population council\n\n1:24:42.760 --> 1:24:45.600\n with the major donor being Warren Buffet.\n\n1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:48.560\n And the Rockefellers and the Buffets\n\n1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:51.360\n and some of the Pritzkers were involved in funding this.\n\n1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:54.160\n So that was the first nonprofit.\n\n1:24:54.160 --> 1:24:59.160\n But the MAPS was designed as from the very beginning,\n\n1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:03.440\n not academic research into psychedelics,\n\n1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:04.640\n but drug development.\n\n1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:06.360\n And that's a fundamental distinction.\n\n1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:08.600\n And that's why I think we're years ahead now\n\n1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:11.120\n with everybody else in terms of making\n\n1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:13.780\n a psychedelic assisted therapy into a medicine.\n\n1:25:13.780 --> 1:25:16.840\n Because our goal from the very beginning was not knowledge,\n\n1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:19.040\n not academic research, it was practical.\n\n1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:20.080\n It was drug development.\n\n1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:22.440\n How do we create new social structures?\n\n1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:25.120\n How do we create legal access to these things?\n\n1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:28.400\n Now, in December of 2014,\n\n1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:31.880\n we created the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation.\n\n1:25:31.880 --> 1:25:36.680\n So MAPS is a nonprofit, but in our 35 years,\n\n1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:39.720\n we've raised about $110 million in donations.\n\n1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:43.800\n What I didn't know when I started MAPS,\n\n1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:46.520\n and it took me quite a few years,\n\n1:25:46.520 --> 1:25:50.440\n I didn't even know this till about eight, nine years ago,\n\n1:25:50.440 --> 1:25:54.840\n was that in 1984, Ronald Reagan had signed a bill\n\n1:25:54.840 --> 1:25:57.140\n to create incentives for developing drugs\n\n1:25:57.140 --> 1:25:58.840\n that were off patent.\n\n1:25:58.840 --> 1:26:02.040\n So MDMA was invented by Merck in 1912.\n\n1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:03.720\n It's in the public domain.\n\n1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:06.320\n These incentives are called data exclusivity,\n\n1:26:06.320 --> 1:26:08.360\n which means that if you make a drug into a medicine\n\n1:26:08.360 --> 1:26:10.260\n that has no patent protection,\n\n1:26:10.260 --> 1:26:13.440\n nobody can use your data for a period of time\n\n1:26:13.440 --> 1:26:14.660\n to market a generic.\n\n1:26:14.660 --> 1:26:16.520\n And that will effectively be,\n\n1:26:16.520 --> 1:26:18.880\n well, it's five years, you do pediatric studies,\n\n1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:20.520\n you get six months extension,\n\n1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:24.120\n and we are being required, if we succeed in adults,\n\n1:26:24.120 --> 1:26:26.520\n to work with adolescents with PTSD.\n\n1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:28.140\n It blocks a generic competitor\n\n1:26:28.140 --> 1:26:30.840\n from applying till that five and a half years is over,\n\n1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:33.140\n takes FDA at least six months to review.\n\n1:26:33.140 --> 1:26:35.940\n So more or less six years of data exclusivity,\n\n1:26:35.940 --> 1:26:38.820\n 10 years in Europe is data exclusivity.\n\n1:26:38.820 --> 1:26:42.300\n So the story then became to the donors\n\n1:26:42.300 --> 1:26:45.240\n that you're not gonna have to give us money forever\n\n1:26:45.240 --> 1:26:48.300\n because we can make money selling MDMA,\n\n1:26:48.300 --> 1:26:51.700\n but we wanna do two revolutionary things, you could say.\n\n1:26:51.700 --> 1:26:53.800\n One is psychedelic assisted psychotherapy,\n\n1:26:53.800 --> 1:26:56.440\n but the other is marketing drugs.\n\n1:26:56.440 --> 1:26:59.740\n When you market it with the profit maximization motive,\n\n1:26:59.740 --> 1:27:02.480\n we end up in the extreme getting the distortions\n\n1:27:02.480 --> 1:27:03.520\n that we have in America,\n\n1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:06.720\n where we have the most expensive healthcare system\n\n1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:07.840\n in the world per capita,\n\n1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:11.000\n but our outcomes are down like 40 or 50 among the countries,\n\n1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:11.880\n our average outcomes.\n\n1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:13.900\n We don't have, third of the people or so\n\n1:27:13.900 --> 1:27:17.360\n don't have insurance, and it's just very inequitable.\n\n1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:19.440\n So what we're trying to do\n\n1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:22.640\n is show a different way to market drugs.\n\n1:27:22.640 --> 1:27:24.560\n And it's a modification of capitalism\n\n1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:26.640\n that's called the benefit corporation,\n\n1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:29.560\n where you maximize public benefit, not profit.\n\n1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:31.320\n You still make a profit.\n\n1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:33.420\n So selling MDMA for a profit\n\n1:27:33.420 --> 1:27:36.560\n is not something we could keep inside the nonprofit\n\n1:27:36.560 --> 1:27:39.480\n because it's taxable, it's a business.\n\n1:27:39.480 --> 1:27:42.740\n So we've created the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation,\n\n1:27:42.740 --> 1:27:45.120\n which is 100% owned by the nonprofit.\n\n1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:48.120\n So we have a nonprofit that owns a pharma company.\n\n1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:51.240\n And the mission of that pharma company\n\n1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:53.680\n is to maximize not profit,\n\n1:27:53.680 --> 1:27:55.620\n but maximize benefit for society.\n\n1:27:55.620 --> 1:27:56.720\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:27:56.720 --> 1:27:58.720\n Although there still will be profits,\n\n1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:00.760\n and the profits that we're gonna make\n\n1:28:00.760 --> 1:28:03.940\n are going to be used towards the mission of MAPS,\n\n1:28:03.940 --> 1:28:05.920\n which is again, is this mass mental health\n\n1:28:05.920 --> 1:28:08.040\n and ending the drug war.\n\n1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:10.600\n And in fact, we've hired the Boston Consulting Group\n\n1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:15.360\n to help us plot our commercialization strategy.\n\n1:28:15.360 --> 1:28:18.040\n And so there is some suggestions based,\n\n1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:19.920\n there's so many different assumptions in this,\n\n1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:22.040\n the number of therapists that we train,\n\n1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:24.480\n the price that we set for the MDMA,\n\n1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:27.440\n whether insurance companies will cover it.\n\n1:28:27.440 --> 1:28:30.680\n But there's the possibility of somewhere in the range\n\n1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:33.760\n of three quarters of a billion dollars in profits\n\n1:28:33.760 --> 1:28:36.160\n during this period of data exclusivity,\n\n1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:40.720\n just from the US and we're talking about\n\n1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:42.960\n trying to do this research around the world as well.\n\n1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:45.120\n So that's what the Benefit Corporation is.\n\n1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:47.360\n The Benefit Corporation is our pharmaceutical arm.\n\n1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:50.000\n We're about 130 people now,\n\n1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:51.720\n somewhere in that fluctuates,\n\n1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:54.140\n but one third of them are in the nonprofit.\n\n1:28:54.140 --> 1:28:57.880\n We do harm reduction, psychedelic harm reduction.\n\n1:28:57.880 --> 1:29:02.000\n We help create programs for people\n\n1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:04.480\n with difficult psychedelic experiences\n\n1:29:04.480 --> 1:29:06.680\n at Burning Man, at festivals all over the world,\n\n1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:11.040\n even in cities we're now negotiating with the police,\n\n1:29:11.040 --> 1:29:14.200\n the city of Denver, because Denver has made the mushrooms\n\n1:29:14.200 --> 1:29:16.680\n the lowest enforcement priority.\n\n1:29:16.680 --> 1:29:18.960\n Oregon has passed the Oregon psilocybin initiative.\n\n1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:21.500\n So in those areas where maybe more people\n\n1:29:21.500 --> 1:29:23.060\n are gonna gravitate to do psychedelics,\n\n1:29:23.060 --> 1:29:24.640\n we want there to be harm reduction\n\n1:29:24.640 --> 1:29:27.600\n so that we don't have bad stories coming up\n\n1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:29.120\n that would change that.\n\n1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:31.040\n So MAPS does the psychedelic harm reduction.\n\n1:29:31.040 --> 1:29:32.560\n We do public education.\n\n1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:33.400\n We do a lot of it.\n\n1:29:33.400 --> 1:29:35.120\n That's what you and I are doing right now.\n\n1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:36.320\n We're doing that now.\n\n1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:40.280\n But also research towards.\n\n1:29:40.280 --> 1:29:42.960\n Well, the research now is done in the Benefit Corp.\n\n1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:43.800\n In the Benefit Corp.\n\n1:29:43.800 --> 1:29:46.120\n Yeah, so what happens is people donate to MAPS,\n\n1:29:46.120 --> 1:29:48.480\n get a tax deduction, MAPS transfers the money,\n\n1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:50.840\n or you could say invests in the Benefit Corp.\n\n1:29:50.840 --> 1:29:51.680\n Yes.\n\n1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:53.000\n The Benefit Corp will do the research\n\n1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:55.640\n and then MAPS is the sponsor,\n\n1:29:55.640 --> 1:29:57.640\n but then we will license the sale of MDMA\n\n1:29:57.640 --> 1:29:58.720\n to the Benefit Corp, so.\n\n1:29:58.720 --> 1:30:01.240\n Got it, but the research is done with an eye\n\n1:30:01.240 --> 1:30:03.480\n towards creating something that has a big impact\n\n1:30:03.480 --> 1:30:06.120\n versus just research for knowledge's sake.\n\n1:30:06.120 --> 1:30:11.120\n Yeah, yeah, because I'm interested in political change.\n\n1:30:13.080 --> 1:30:16.640\n The other part of it, which is that the brain\n\n1:30:16.640 --> 1:30:20.160\n is the most complex thing we know in the universe.\n\n1:30:21.040 --> 1:30:22.400\n It's endless.\n\n1:30:22.400 --> 1:30:24.600\n I mean, when are we gonna really, like this idea of,\n\n1:30:24.600 --> 1:30:26.000\n will we figure out telepathy?\n\n1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:28.760\n Will we figure out tapping into the collective unconscious?\n\n1:30:28.760 --> 1:30:31.160\n What is the extents of our brain?\n\n1:30:31.160 --> 1:30:32.320\n How does the brain actually work?\n\n1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:33.880\n Do you ask chemistry questions?\n\n1:30:33.880 --> 1:30:36.480\n So if it's just the pursuit of knowledge,\n\n1:30:36.480 --> 1:30:37.920\n that is an endless thing.\n\n1:30:37.920 --> 1:30:39.440\n And how does that end the drug war?\n\n1:30:39.440 --> 1:30:41.120\n How does that help people directly?\n\n1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:43.720\n So that's why we're focused on drug development\n\n1:30:43.720 --> 1:30:45.800\n more than mechanism of action.\n\n1:30:45.800 --> 1:30:48.520\n Before I ask you about one,\n\n1:30:48.520 --> 1:30:50.960\n but several really exciting studies,\n\n1:30:51.880 --> 1:30:54.760\n let me ask sort of a personal question for me.\n\n1:30:54.760 --> 1:30:59.080\n So if I wanted to get psychedelics\n\n1:30:59.080 --> 1:31:04.080\n from the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation\n\n1:31:04.240 --> 1:31:09.240\n and explore my own mind, how do I get to do that?\n\n1:31:10.040 --> 1:31:10.880\n And when?\n\n1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:12.000\n You won't be able to.\n\n1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:12.840\n You'll never be able to.\n\n1:31:12.840 --> 1:31:14.400\n This is very unfortunate.\n\n1:31:14.400 --> 1:31:17.160\n Because the reason is because the Benefit Corp\n\n1:31:17.160 --> 1:31:20.120\n is designed as a pharmaceutical company.\n\n1:31:20.120 --> 1:31:23.800\n So we can only work on clinical indication.\n\n1:31:23.800 --> 1:31:25.840\n So let's say you come to me and you just say,\n\n1:31:25.840 --> 1:31:27.080\n oh, I'm really depressed.\n\n1:31:27.080 --> 1:31:30.560\n Can I get MDMA to overcome my depression\n\n1:31:30.560 --> 1:31:32.880\n or overcome my PTSD?\n\n1:31:32.880 --> 1:31:35.760\n We'll have to do research in those indications.\n\n1:31:35.760 --> 1:31:38.200\n And by when you say me, you mean like a doctor.\n\n1:31:38.200 --> 1:31:40.560\n So this would be prescribed in theory by doctors.\n\n1:31:40.560 --> 1:31:43.560\n Well, this would go through a doctor and a prescription.\n\n1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:46.480\n Okay, let me ask another question.\n\n1:31:46.480 --> 1:31:47.320\n To further answer,\n\n1:31:47.320 --> 1:31:49.600\n so that's where the drug policy arm comes in,\n\n1:31:49.600 --> 1:31:51.160\n the drug policy reform.\n\n1:31:51.160 --> 1:31:54.520\n So you should be able to get access to psychedelics\n\n1:31:54.520 --> 1:31:56.560\n for your own personal growth.\n\n1:31:56.560 --> 1:31:59.160\n But that's not medicine.\n\n1:31:59.160 --> 1:32:02.160\n So that's why we need to medicalize,\n\n1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:04.600\n to have things covered by insurance,\n\n1:32:04.600 --> 1:32:07.440\n to change people's attitudes, the public attitudes.\n\n1:32:07.440 --> 1:32:11.720\n And then we get this subsequent drug policy reform.\n\n1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:12.840\n And we're talking about it\n\n1:32:12.840 --> 1:32:14.720\n in terms of licensed legalization.\n\n1:32:14.720 --> 1:32:18.280\n So my view is you should get a license to do psychedelics,\n\n1:32:18.280 --> 1:32:19.880\n you get a little education stuff,\n\n1:32:19.880 --> 1:32:21.160\n and then you should be able to buy it\n\n1:32:21.160 --> 1:32:22.000\n and do it on your own.\n\n1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:24.160\n So let me rephrase the question in more specifically.\n\n1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:29.080\n So when can I, if I happen to have ailments of some kind\n\n1:32:29.080 --> 1:32:31.880\n where the doctor decides that psychedelics could help,\n\n1:32:31.880 --> 1:32:35.160\n when would you be a loose estimate for you\n\n1:32:35.160 --> 1:32:37.720\n of when a doctor will be able to prescribe to me\n\n1:32:37.720 --> 1:32:41.480\n something from MAPS Public Benefit Co.\n\n1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:45.000\n And then when for my personal growth and creativity,\n\n1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:46.360\n would I be able to get something?\n\n1:32:46.360 --> 1:32:49.160\n So like, just looking out, this isn't like guaranteed,\n\n1:32:49.160 --> 1:32:53.160\n but like your vision, your hope for,\n\n1:32:53.160 --> 1:32:56.000\n yeah, for psychedelics in society.\n\n1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:59.960\n Well, the end of 2023, so two and a half years from now,\n\n1:32:59.960 --> 1:33:02.240\n we anticipate FDA approval\n\n1:33:02.240 --> 1:33:04.960\n for the prescription use of MDMA for PTSD.\n\n1:33:05.840 --> 1:33:10.840\n Because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine,\n\n1:33:11.680 --> 1:33:14.720\n there is what's called off label prescription.\n\n1:33:14.720 --> 1:33:16.840\n What that means, the label is what it's approved for.\n\n1:33:16.840 --> 1:33:20.320\n So the label will say, oh, this is approved for PTSD.\n\n1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:23.200\n But let's say you come and anything else, social anxiety\n\n1:33:23.200 --> 1:33:24.720\n or whatever, you can go to the doctor,\n\n1:33:24.720 --> 1:33:26.360\n they can give it to you.\n\n1:33:26.360 --> 1:33:27.920\n It might not be covered by insurance,\n\n1:33:27.920 --> 1:33:30.560\n they have to be a little bit careful about malpractice.\n\n1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:32.640\n But I think the end of 2023\n\n1:33:32.640 --> 1:33:34.880\n is when you will be able to do that.\n\n1:33:34.880 --> 1:33:38.800\n Now, there's actually another program, very limited,\n\n1:33:38.800 --> 1:33:42.640\n called Expanded Access, which is compassionate use,\n\n1:33:42.640 --> 1:33:45.640\n which means that, and we have approval for 50 people\n\n1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:48.960\n for compassionate use right now, we think that'll grow.\n\n1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:51.320\n So that's gonna open up in about two months.\n\n1:33:51.320 --> 1:33:53.680\n And so those are people with PTSD,\n\n1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:55.080\n they have to be treatment resistant,\n\n1:33:55.080 --> 1:33:56.120\n nothing has worked for them.\n\n1:33:56.120 --> 1:33:58.480\n And they can access MDMA\n\n1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:00.480\n while we're doing the phase three studies.\n\n1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:04.280\n But they have to pay for it themselves.\n\n1:34:04.280 --> 1:34:06.320\n The sponsor has to pay for all the research.\n\n1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:09.760\n But Expanded Access, because there's no control group,\n\n1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:12.960\n everybody gets the MDMA, people can pay for it themselves.\n\n1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:15.320\n And we think that'll start in a couple months.\n\n1:34:15.320 --> 1:34:17.760\n But it's very limited, it's limited to certain cities.\n\n1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:20.520\n There's also a program called Right to Try,\n\n1:34:20.520 --> 1:34:23.000\n which is passed through Congress.\n\n1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:26.080\n It's similar to this idea of compassionate use,\n\n1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:28.280\n but it cuts the FDA out of it.\n\n1:34:28.280 --> 1:34:32.960\n And patients can negotiate directly with pharma companies\n\n1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:34.560\n to get access to their drugs.\n\n1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:38.800\n That's starting to happen, I think, in Canada now,\n\n1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:41.200\n they're letting people have compassionate access\n\n1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:44.160\n to psilocybin for life threatening illness,\n\n1:34:44.160 --> 1:34:46.560\n because there has been studies with psilocybin\n\n1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:49.720\n for cancer patients and others with life threatening illness.\n\n1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:51.800\n As far as your question about when will you be able\n\n1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:55.960\n to access this for personal growth outside of medicine?\n\n1:34:56.840 --> 1:34:59.000\n I'll take that to mean fully legally,\n\n1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:00.960\n where you can just go buy pure drugs somewhere,\n\n1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:02.240\n when will that happen?\n\n1:35:02.240 --> 1:35:05.640\n We already are starting to see the decriminalization\n\n1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:08.400\n in certain areas of plant psychedelics.\n\n1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:13.440\n And we see overall drug decrim, like that passed in Oregon,\n\n1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:16.040\n so that any drug is now, it's not legal,\n\n1:35:16.040 --> 1:35:20.720\n you can't really fully set up clinics to offer it to people\n\n1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:22.640\n or there's no legal supply like that,\n\n1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:24.240\n but it's decriminalized.\n\n1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:27.480\n So my sense of things is based a lot on watching\n\n1:35:27.480 --> 1:35:28.960\n what happened with medical marijuana\n\n1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:30.160\n and marijuana legalization.\n\n1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:31.800\n So we're sitting here in Massachusetts\n\n1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:33.600\n where marijuana is legal,\n\n1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:36.240\n but what happened first was medical marijuana.\n\n1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:40.000\n So what we see is that medicalization,\n\n1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:43.320\n by demonstrating that under certain contexts,\n\n1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:47.640\n the risks are much less than the benefits,\n\n1:35:47.640 --> 1:35:49.320\n and then there are benefits,\n\n1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:51.440\n and then people hear stories about people\n\n1:35:51.440 --> 1:35:53.000\n that have gotten better,\n\n1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:54.520\n and then that changes their minds,\n\n1:35:54.520 --> 1:35:57.080\n and then eventually that builds up to why are we throwing\n\n1:35:57.080 --> 1:35:57.920\n people in jail for this?\n\n1:35:57.920 --> 1:35:59.200\n Just the culture, yeah.\n\n1:35:59.200 --> 1:36:02.520\n Yeah, so I think that what we're gonna have 2023\n\n1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:07.040\n is MDMA approved by the FDA, chances are.\n\n1:36:07.040 --> 1:36:09.800\n Psilocybin will be a year or two after that.\n\n1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:11.600\n Then what we're gonna need is a decade\n\n1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:14.120\n of psychedelic clinics that are gonna roll out\n\n1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:17.920\n across America, also other countries as well,\n\n1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:20.040\n thousands of these psychedelic clinics.\n\n1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:22.680\n We already have hundreds of ketamine clinics\n\n1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:26.120\n that are ketamine for depression.\n\n1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:28.200\n More and more people are realizing that ketamine,\n\n1:36:28.200 --> 1:36:31.520\n when it's used with therapy, it's better than when it's not.\n\n1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:34.120\n But the therapists wanna be psychedelic therapists.\n\n1:36:34.120 --> 1:36:36.720\n They don't wanna be a ketamine therapist or an MDMA therapist.\n\n1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:38.360\n So they'll be cross trained.\n\n1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:40.480\n So we will have a decade of these thousands\n\n1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:42.360\n of psychedelic clinics and all these stories\n\n1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:43.200\n of people getting better.\n\n1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:46.400\n And 2035 is when I think that we will move\n\n1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:49.800\n to licensed legalization, which is when you will\n\n1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:52.960\n have the option of just going somewhere\n\n1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:55.440\n once you've done this educational stuff.\n\n1:36:55.440 --> 1:36:58.040\n Potentially, I also think it would be better\n\n1:36:58.040 --> 1:37:02.080\n to have the opportunity for people to go for free,\n\n1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:04.360\n paid for by tax money, to these clinics,\n\n1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:05.760\n and you have your first experience\n\n1:37:05.760 --> 1:37:08.080\n with psychedelics under supervision.\n\n1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:09.720\n And you know what you're getting into.\n\n1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:12.840\n You've, you know, to ask the questionnaire,\n\n1:37:12.840 --> 1:37:14.120\n what the risks are with the drugs,\n\n1:37:14.120 --> 1:37:15.760\n then you get your license.\n\n1:37:15.760 --> 1:37:18.000\n So 2035 is when I think that'll happen.\n\n1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.880\n And the clinics will be sites of these initiations.\n\n1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:21.840\n Yes.\n\n1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:23.760\n And so it'd be a safe environment, just like you said,\n\n1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:27.240\n all the things that are actually maximize the likelihood\n\n1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:30.120\n of a pleasant experience and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:37:30.120 --> 1:37:32.520\n It is a frustratingly slow process.\n\n1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:36.600\n And the FDA being part of that process is very frustrating.\n\n1:37:36.600 --> 1:37:40.000\n But of course there's benefits,\n\n1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:44.000\n but boy, I wish it could move a lot faster.\n\n1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:45.800\n Yeah, well, one thing that I've learned\n\n1:37:45.800 --> 1:37:50.800\n from being a parent is that when you have little kids,\n\n1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:55.320\n it seems like they'll be with you forever.\n\n1:37:55.320 --> 1:37:58.280\n But then when they grow up and they go to college\n\n1:37:58.280 --> 1:37:59.760\n and they leave, do you look back and like,\n\n1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:01.800\n where did that 20 years go?\n\n1:38:01.800 --> 1:38:02.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:05.240\n You know, so we're still dealing with the legacy\n\n1:38:05.240 --> 1:38:08.000\n of the civil war and slavery in America.\n\n1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:11.560\n So actually a 20 year plan is not that long.\n\n1:38:11.560 --> 1:38:16.560\n So while we say it's frustratingly slow, and it is,\n\n1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:21.400\n I mean, it's 50 years since the psychedelic sixties.\n\n1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:26.400\n And right now it's 36 years since MDMA was criminalized.\n\n1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.600\n And you think about all those people that committed suicide\n\n1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:34.240\n from PTSD or from anything else.\n\n1:38:34.240 --> 1:38:36.840\n And all those people that could have been helped\n\n1:38:36.840 --> 1:38:40.440\n if the DEA had accepted the Administrative Law Judge\n\n1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:42.920\n recommendation that MDMA stay in schedule three.\n\n1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:45.320\n It's tremendously sad.\n\n1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:48.360\n At the same time, culture evolves slowly.\n\n1:38:48.360 --> 1:38:50.420\n You know, you read the Bible or you read all this stuff,\n\n1:38:50.420 --> 1:38:53.260\n we're not that different from people thousands of years ago.\n\n1:38:53.260 --> 1:38:56.880\n So how are we gonna really evolve enough\n\n1:38:56.880 --> 1:38:58.440\n over the next couple of decades\n\n1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:01.520\n so we don't destroy the planet and don't kill each other?\n\n1:39:01.520 --> 1:39:04.600\n That's why I think psychedelics have an important role\n\n1:39:04.600 --> 1:39:07.800\n to play, that's why I've devoted my life to psychedelics.\n\n1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:09.600\n And it is frustratingly slow.\n\n1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:13.360\n And what I said to myself is our whole effort\n\n1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:15.340\n has not been fast enough.\n\n1:39:15.340 --> 1:39:18.600\n Can we talk a little bit about PTSD and MDMA?\n\n1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:22.720\n There's this fascinating paper came out\n\n1:39:22.720 --> 1:39:26.520\n on a fascinating study that you're a part of.\n\n1:39:26.520 --> 1:39:27.920\n That's a phase three study.\n\n1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:29.580\n Can you describe what the study is?\n\n1:39:29.580 --> 1:39:31.780\n Can you describe what phase three means?\n\n1:39:31.780 --> 1:39:35.000\n Can you describe what the findings are\n\n1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:39.020\n and why it's in fact so important and impactful?\n\n1:39:39.020 --> 1:39:41.840\n Yeah, this study came out May 10th in Nature Medicine.\n\n1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:44.680\n So one of the highest impact factors in medicine,\n\n1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:46.160\n journals, it was tremendous.\n\n1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:48.780\n So to make a drug into a medicine,\n\n1:39:48.780 --> 1:39:51.280\n the first thing you need to do is what are called\n\n1:39:52.360 --> 1:39:54.240\n nonclinical or preclinical studies,\n\n1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:57.040\n meaning safety established in animals.\n\n1:39:57.040 --> 1:39:58.440\n What does the drug do?\n\n1:39:58.440 --> 1:40:00.080\n What are the side effects in animals?\n\n1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:01.240\n Where do you see the risks?\n\n1:40:01.240 --> 1:40:05.600\n And then you negotiate with FDA to do phase one studies.\n\n1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:07.440\n And phase one studies are where you move\n\n1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:09.280\n from animals to humans.\n\n1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:11.960\n And those are more safety studies\n\n1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:14.500\n and trying to describe what the drug does\n\n1:40:14.500 --> 1:40:16.160\n so that you can determine\n\n1:40:16.160 --> 1:40:19.120\n if there is potential medical value there.\n\n1:40:19.120 --> 1:40:24.120\n Certain drugs like cancer drugs are so toxic\n\n1:40:24.120 --> 1:40:29.120\n that you don't have phase one studies in healthy volunteers.\n\n1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:31.440\n That's like phase one slash two,\n\n1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:33.840\n where you bring in the patients,\n\n1:40:33.840 --> 1:40:35.880\n but you still are doing sort of dose response\n\n1:40:35.880 --> 1:40:38.640\n safety studies, but you use patients.\n\n1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:41.640\n But most phase one studies are healthy volunteers.\n\n1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:45.440\n Phase two are where you start bringing in the patients\n\n1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:48.400\n and you start experimenting with various different things.\n\n1:40:48.400 --> 1:40:52.120\n The purpose of phase two is really just to design phase three.\n\n1:40:52.120 --> 1:40:55.480\n Now, again, I'm sort of putting out of the picture\n\n1:40:55.480 --> 1:40:57.240\n in another area is mechanism of action.\n\n1:40:57.240 --> 1:40:58.680\n How do these drugs work?\n\n1:40:58.680 --> 1:41:01.440\n Phase two, you're trying to figure out what they do,\n\n1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:05.400\n who your patient population is, what are the risks,\n\n1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:07.800\n who do you include, who do you exclude,\n\n1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:10.520\n what are the doses, what is your treatment,\n\n1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:11.960\n what are your measures.\n\n1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:18.160\n In our case, it was how do you do a double blind study?\n\n1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:20.240\n That was a big part of phase two.\n\n1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:22.800\n That's a big challenge for psychedelic drugs.\n\n1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:25.880\n Any kind of drugs that have a real strong effect,\n\n1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:27.480\n how do you do a double blind study?\n\n1:41:27.480 --> 1:41:28.960\n The double blind, sorry to interrupt,\n\n1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:33.480\n would mean that the patient should not be aware\n\n1:41:33.480 --> 1:41:35.800\n whether it's a placebo or not.\n\n1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:36.960\n And the researcher.\n\n1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:39.160\n And the researcher is not aware.\n\n1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:41.000\n And so for that lack of awareness,\n\n1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:42.320\n when the effect is really strong,\n\n1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:44.160\n it's very difficult to do on both the researcher\n\n1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:45.680\n and the patient side.\n\n1:41:45.680 --> 1:41:49.200\n Yes, and sometimes they talk about triple blind.\n\n1:41:49.200 --> 1:41:51.280\n So the other part is the raters\n\n1:41:51.280 --> 1:41:54.080\n that evaluate the symptoms and before and after.\n\n1:41:54.080 --> 1:41:55.880\n So you ideally want triple blind.\n\n1:41:55.880 --> 1:41:58.880\n You want the patients, the researchers,\n\n1:41:58.880 --> 1:42:02.200\n and the evaluators of the outcomes, all of them,\n\n1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:05.320\n not to know what the drug, whether it was drug or placebo,\n\n1:42:05.320 --> 1:42:07.560\n and that's to reduce experiment or bias.\n\n1:42:10.200 --> 1:42:12.040\n And then you move to phase three,\n\n1:42:12.040 --> 1:42:15.560\n once you've figured out how to design the phase three studies.\n\n1:42:15.560 --> 1:42:18.800\n And phase three are the large scale multiple studies\n\n1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:23.000\n multi site, placebo controlled, double blind studies,\n\n1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.520\n where you must prove safety and efficacy\n\n1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:28.520\n in order to get permission to market the drug.\n\n1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:33.120\n Now, for us, when we started MAPS in 86,\n\n1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.040\n as I said, it was one year after the criminalization\n\n1:42:36.040 --> 1:42:39.880\n of MDMA in 85, we had five different protocols\n\n1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:43.960\n that were rejected by the FDA for studying with MDMA.\n\n1:42:43.960 --> 1:42:46.800\n And these were all various phase one studies.\n\n1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:49.240\n They came from Harvard, from UC San Francisco,\n\n1:42:49.240 --> 1:42:51.360\n from the University in Arizona,\n\n1:42:51.360 --> 1:42:53.840\n and Albuquerque, New Mexico, all over.\n\n1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:55.640\n And they were all rejected.\n\n1:42:55.640 --> 1:42:59.040\n 1992, six years after we started,\n\n1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:01.840\n we got the first permission for phase one.\n\n1:43:02.720 --> 1:43:05.560\n And that took us through much of the 90s.\n\n1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:08.160\n Again, things are slow because we have to raise the money\n\n1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:09.320\n through donations.\n\n1:43:09.320 --> 1:43:14.320\n And then in 1999 is when we started the work with PTSD.\n\n1:43:14.320 --> 1:43:19.320\n And that then took us till November 29th, 2016,\n\n1:43:22.720 --> 1:43:25.920\n which is when we had the end of phase two meeting with FDA.\n\n1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:29.200\n So it took 30 years from the start of MAPS\n\n1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:31.960\n to the end of phase two meeting with FDA.\n\n1:43:31.960 --> 1:43:35.520\n And what we had discovered during phase two\n\n1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:38.960\n was several different key points.\n\n1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:42.440\n The drugs that are available right now for PTSD,\n\n1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:45.320\n the SSRIs, Zoloft and Paxil,\n\n1:43:45.320 --> 1:43:47.960\n that have been approved by FDA and regulators in Europe\n\n1:43:47.960 --> 1:43:52.200\n as well, the European Medicines Agency, for PTSD,\n\n1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:54.600\n they work better in women than in men,\n\n1:43:54.600 --> 1:43:57.520\n and they failed in combat related PTSD.\n\n1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:02.000\n All right, so what we learned is that MDMA assisted therapy\n\n1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:03.880\n works just as well in men or women,\n\n1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:06.480\n and it works in combat related PTSD.\n\n1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:09.280\n It works in regardless of the cause of PTSD.\n\n1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:12.960\n We also discovered that even though there are stories\n\n1:44:12.960 --> 1:44:16.080\n that people take MDMA at raves and they dance all night\n\n1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:18.040\n and they overheat and they get hypothermia\n\n1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:20.400\n and they die from overheating, which is true\n\n1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:22.200\n and can happen from pure MDMA,\n\n1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:25.400\n or that sometimes people have heard about\n\n1:44:25.400 --> 1:44:29.080\n needing to cool down and so they drink water\n\n1:44:29.080 --> 1:44:31.440\n and then while they're dancing all night\n\n1:44:31.440 --> 1:44:32.840\n and then they drink too much water\n\n1:44:32.840 --> 1:44:34.280\n and then they dilute their blood\n\n1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:36.520\n and they die from hyponatremia.\n\n1:44:36.520 --> 1:44:39.440\n So there are risks of MDMA, but we discovered\n\n1:44:39.440 --> 1:44:41.040\n that in a therapeutic setting,\n\n1:44:41.040 --> 1:44:42.680\n we can control all those risks,\n\n1:44:42.680 --> 1:44:44.960\n those things don't happen at all.\n\n1:44:44.960 --> 1:44:48.560\n So we discovered safety, we could demonstrate safety.\n\n1:44:49.680 --> 1:44:53.680\n We also figured out that our measure, the CAPS,\n\n1:44:53.680 --> 1:44:55.920\n the Clinician Administrative PTSD Scale,\n\n1:44:55.920 --> 1:44:58.320\n that it's the gold standard all over the world\n\n1:44:58.320 --> 1:44:59.840\n for measuring PTSD symptoms,\n\n1:44:59.840 --> 1:45:02.440\n it's what the FDA and the EMA require.\n\n1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:04.760\n We discovered that it was a good measure for us\n\n1:45:04.760 --> 1:45:06.880\n and that we could show changes in that.\n\n1:45:07.880 --> 1:45:11.400\n The other big thing that we learned is that,\n\n1:45:11.400 --> 1:45:13.040\n and we haven't mentioned this yet,\n\n1:45:13.040 --> 1:45:16.800\n but the work in the 50s and 60s with LSD and psilocybin\n\n1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:19.000\n and the modern research over the last 20 years\n\n1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:20.840\n with psilocybin and classic psychedelics\n\n1:45:20.840 --> 1:45:23.120\n has demonstrated that there's a link\n\n1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:24.960\n between this mystical experience,\n\n1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:28.280\n this unit of mystical experience and therapeutic outcomes\n\n1:45:28.280 --> 1:45:29.560\n for the treatment of addiction,\n\n1:45:29.560 --> 1:45:32.320\n for working with people with life threatening illnesses\n\n1:45:32.320 --> 1:45:36.760\n that for OCD, for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,\n\n1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:39.800\n that there's with the classic psychedelics,\n\n1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:42.600\n both in the 50 years ago and then the research now\n\n1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:45.240\n has been that there's a link between the depth\n\n1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:48.680\n of the mystical experience and therapeutic outcome.\n\n1:45:48.680 --> 1:45:52.320\n What we discovered is that that's not the case for MDMA,\n\n1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:55.000\n that people do score fairly high\n\n1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:56.960\n on the scales of mystical experience,\n\n1:45:56.960 --> 1:45:59.240\n not as high as they do with the classic psychedelics,\n\n1:45:59.240 --> 1:46:02.480\n but they do score pretty high on average.\n\n1:46:02.480 --> 1:46:06.360\n And a significant number of them have over the cutoff\n\n1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:09.120\n for what would be considered a full mystical experience.\n\n1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:11.840\n So enough to say that we could look at a correlation\n\n1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:13.600\n and we didn't find any.\n\n1:46:13.600 --> 1:46:15.120\n The other thing that we discovered,\n\n1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:20.000\n and this was more humbling, I would say for me personally,\n\n1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.400\n is that my dissertation at the Kennedy School,\n\n1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:24.440\n a big part of it was on the,\n\n1:46:24.440 --> 1:46:26.240\n it's about the regulation of the medical use\n\n1:46:26.240 --> 1:46:27.840\n of psychedelics in marijuana.\n\n1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:29.680\n A big part of my dissertation was how to do\n\n1:46:29.680 --> 1:46:31.760\n the double blind study.\n\n1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:33.200\n And I thought I'd solve the problem\n\n1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:35.560\n and I persuaded my dissertation committee\n\n1:46:35.560 --> 1:46:37.480\n that I'd solve the problem.\n\n1:46:37.480 --> 1:46:41.240\n And the solution was therapy with low dose MDMA\n\n1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:43.960\n versus therapy with full dose MDMA.\n\n1:46:43.960 --> 1:46:46.840\n And everybody knows that they're gonna get MDMA,\n\n1:46:46.840 --> 1:46:49.040\n most of these people have never done it before,\n\n1:46:49.040 --> 1:46:52.640\n they'll be confused about is it full dose or low dose.\n\n1:46:52.640 --> 1:46:56.200\n And then the challenge is to pick a dose\n\n1:46:56.200 --> 1:47:00.080\n that's high enough so that there is this confusion,\n\n1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:02.120\n but not so high that it's so therapeutic\n\n1:47:02.120 --> 1:47:04.800\n that we can't tell the difference between the groups.\n\n1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:09.360\n So we studied zero, meaning inactive placebo,\n\n1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:12.120\n 25 milligrams, 30 milligrams, 40 milligrams,\n\n1:47:12.120 --> 1:47:14.680\n 50 milligrams, 75 milligrams, 100 milligrams,\n\n1:47:14.680 --> 1:47:16.320\n 125 and 150.\n\n1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:21.960\n What we discovered is that my dissertation was wrong\n\n1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:24.320\n and that there is no good solution\n\n1:47:24.320 --> 1:47:26.280\n to the double blind problem.\n\n1:47:26.280 --> 1:47:31.280\n What we found is that, to our surprise actually,\n\n1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:34.840\n was that 75 milligrams was an effective dose.\n\n1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:36.880\n We didn't think that.\n\n1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:39.120\n I mean, the normal dose is like,\n\n1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:42.720\n full dose is like 125 milligrams, something like that.\n\n1:47:42.720 --> 1:47:45.560\n But 75 milligrams was an effective dose.\n\n1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:48.000\n And we discovered that the lower doses,\n\n1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.160\n so I was half right, you could say,\n\n1:47:50.160 --> 1:47:53.440\n the doses of 25, 30, 40, 50,\n\n1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:57.040\n they could produce enough confusion\n\n1:47:57.040 --> 1:47:59.440\n that you could say that they were successful at blinding,\n\n1:47:59.440 --> 1:48:02.080\n not perfectly, but enough confusion\n\n1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:05.120\n so that people, therapists, couldn't know for sure\n\n1:48:05.120 --> 1:48:08.760\n so that there was this reduction of bias, you could say.\n\n1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:14.120\n But what we discovered, again, to our surprise,\n\n1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:17.400\n was that the low doses made people uncomfortable.\n\n1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:23.400\n They stimulated them, but they didn't reduce the fear.\n\n1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:25.920\n And so people still got better\n\n1:48:25.920 --> 1:48:28.080\n with the therapy with low dose MDMA.\n\n1:48:28.080 --> 1:48:31.800\n But if we gave them therapy with inactive placebo,\n\n1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:33.840\n they did even better\n\n1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:37.360\n than if we gave them therapy with low dose MDMA.\n\n1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:41.320\n So we call it an anti therapeutic effect.\n\n1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:43.520\n I don't mean to imply that they got worse,\n\n1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:45.440\n but it made people uncomfortable.\n\n1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:47.360\n People didn't like it.\n\n1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:49.840\n But we would still help them make some progress.\n\n1:48:49.840 --> 1:48:51.520\n So we had the blinding,\n\n1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:54.720\n but what it meant by reducing the effect of therapy\n\n1:48:54.720 --> 1:48:57.480\n with inactive placebo is that it would make it easier\n\n1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:00.040\n for us to find a difference between the two groups.\n\n1:49:01.080 --> 1:49:02.760\n And so the real question is,\n\n1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:07.240\n if you can do it with therapy, why bother add a drug?\n\n1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:09.160\n So we went to the FDA,\n\n1:49:09.160 --> 1:49:12.000\n and so this was what we discovered during phase two.\n\n1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:15.120\n We went to the FDA at this end of phase two meeting,\n\n1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:17.600\n and we said, we can give you blinding,\n\n1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:20.240\n but it will make it easier for us\n\n1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:22.040\n to find a difference between the two groups.\n\n1:49:22.040 --> 1:49:26.320\n And so we suggest that we do therapy with inactive placebo\n\n1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:29.440\n versus therapy with full dose MDMA.\n\n1:49:29.440 --> 1:49:30.920\n That will cause a problem\n\n1:49:30.920 --> 1:49:34.320\n because most people will be able to tell what they've got.\n\n1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:36.920\n What Tom Loughran, a doctor\n\n1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:39.400\n who used to be head of psychiatry products at FDA\n\n1:49:39.400 --> 1:49:41.640\n is our main advisor.\n\n1:49:41.640 --> 1:49:42.880\n So the first thing he said\n\n1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:45.480\n is that the double blind fails in practice a lot,\n\n1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:47.360\n even with SSRIs,\n\n1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:49.400\n because there's certain side effects\n\n1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:50.720\n that you have with these drugs.\n\n1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:52.640\n And the doctors who are doing these research\n\n1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:55.240\n when you're reporting your side effects,\n\n1:49:55.240 --> 1:49:56.400\n they can say, oh, that's probably,\n\n1:49:56.400 --> 1:49:58.280\n you got the active drug instead of the placebo.\n\n1:49:58.280 --> 1:50:01.800\n So the double blind is in theory is terrific,\n\n1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:05.760\n but in practice, it doesn't always work quite as well.\n\n1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:10.160\n And so what Tom said is that there are two main approaches\n\n1:50:10.160 --> 1:50:13.240\n that they think are important to reduce bias.\n\n1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:15.160\n The first one is easy to do.\n\n1:50:15.160 --> 1:50:17.800\n It's called random assignment.\n\n1:50:17.800 --> 1:50:19.720\n So sometimes there are studies\n\n1:50:19.720 --> 1:50:24.200\n where you'll treat a bunch of people with something\n\n1:50:24.200 --> 1:50:26.720\n and some fraction of them will get better and some won't.\n\n1:50:26.720 --> 1:50:29.160\n And then you say, okay, all those who didn't get better,\n\n1:50:29.160 --> 1:50:31.800\n who volunteers to get this new treatment?\n\n1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:33.200\n And then you give them the new treatment,\n\n1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:34.320\n but the people that volunteer\n\n1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:36.000\n are more likely to wanna get better.\n\n1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:39.680\n They're not representative sample of everybody that has.\n\n1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:41.680\n So when you have random assignment,\n\n1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:43.880\n everybody is similarly motivated\n\n1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:47.280\n and meets the same inclusion, exclusion criteria.\n\n1:50:47.280 --> 1:50:48.680\n So that's what we told,\n\n1:50:48.680 --> 1:50:50.400\n of course we need random assignment.\n\n1:50:50.400 --> 1:50:54.040\n The other part was when the bias double blind\n\n1:50:54.040 --> 1:50:55.760\n doesn't work as well,\n\n1:50:55.760 --> 1:50:59.800\n then the system of independent raters\n\n1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:03.000\n is especially important of how you do that.\n\n1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:08.000\n So we have over a pool of raters, over 20 of them,\n\n1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:11.880\n and we do this monthly interrater reliability tests\n\n1:51:11.880 --> 1:51:15.200\n to make sure that they evaluate this,\n\n1:51:15.200 --> 1:51:17.640\n so that they're given a videotape of a PTSD patient\n\n1:51:17.640 --> 1:51:19.640\n and then they're supposed to rate them\n\n1:51:19.640 --> 1:51:20.800\n according to their symptoms.\n\n1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:22.760\n And then we sort of make sure\n\n1:51:22.760 --> 1:51:24.920\n that we've got this calibrated rater pool\n\n1:51:25.840 --> 1:51:28.760\n and it's all done by Zoom, by telemedicine,\n\n1:51:28.760 --> 1:51:30.880\n and they're randomly assigned to the next person\n\n1:51:30.880 --> 1:51:32.600\n that needs a rating.\n\n1:51:32.600 --> 1:51:34.280\n So they said 20 raters.\n\n1:51:34.280 --> 1:51:35.800\n So we've got like 20 raters\n\n1:51:35.800 --> 1:51:40.280\n and what we wanna do is make it so that each rater\n\n1:51:40.280 --> 1:51:43.640\n sees each patient only once, maybe twice,\n\n1:51:43.640 --> 1:51:47.120\n but not tracking them through the study.\n\n1:51:47.120 --> 1:51:49.440\n So that tries to reduce the bias in the raters\n\n1:51:49.440 --> 1:51:52.200\n that they don't know where this person is in the study.\n\n1:51:54.760 --> 1:51:59.040\n And so there's a fellow, Bob Temple,\n\n1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:01.280\n who's like the old wise man at the FDA.\n\n1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:03.680\n He's been there since 1972.\n\n1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:05.880\n He was in charge of the Office of Science Policy\n\n1:52:05.880 --> 1:52:09.840\n and they brought him into the final meeting of this process\n\n1:52:09.840 --> 1:52:11.880\n where we are trying to design phase three.\n\n1:52:11.880 --> 1:52:14.640\n So once FDA said, yes, you can go to phase three,\n\n1:52:14.640 --> 1:52:17.840\n that was November 29th, 2016,\n\n1:52:17.840 --> 1:52:20.320\n we then negotiated for eight months\n\n1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:21.760\n on the design of phase three\n\n1:52:21.760 --> 1:52:25.320\n and all of the other information that FDA is gonna need.\n\n1:52:25.320 --> 1:52:26.840\n This process of design.\n\n1:52:28.920 --> 1:52:31.920\n To the extent that I have any artistic creativity,\n\n1:52:31.920 --> 1:52:34.520\n it's in protocol design.\n\n1:52:34.520 --> 1:52:35.760\n I really love that.\n\n1:52:35.760 --> 1:52:36.960\n So you enjoy this process.\n\n1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:37.800\n I love it.\n\n1:52:37.800 --> 1:52:39.480\n I love it because it's always trade offs\n\n1:52:39.480 --> 1:52:44.480\n and I acknowledge that we are all biased.\n\n1:52:44.840 --> 1:52:46.080\n And so how do you,\n\n1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:49.600\n there's something beautiful about the scientific process\n\n1:52:49.600 --> 1:52:51.440\n designed to get you to the truth.\n\n1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:54.520\n Especially when that scientific process\n\n1:52:54.520 --> 1:52:57.080\n is trying to get to the truth of the human organism,\n\n1:52:57.080 --> 1:52:58.760\n which is so complicated.\n\n1:52:58.760 --> 1:53:01.960\n So it's very difficult to dissect,\n\n1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:04.360\n to get the strong effects.\n\n1:53:04.360 --> 1:53:06.320\n And when you're analyzing,\n\n1:53:06.320 --> 1:53:09.600\n when you have like raters, they're watching a video.\n\n1:53:11.920 --> 1:53:15.480\n Removing subjectivity from that is very, very challenging.\n\n1:53:15.480 --> 1:53:17.160\n Yeah, very much so.\n\n1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:21.640\n And so we came to this agreement with FDA though\n\n1:53:21.640 --> 1:53:25.840\n that we would use this independent rater pool.\n\n1:53:25.840 --> 1:53:30.840\n And so we learned in phase two again,\n\n1:53:30.840 --> 1:53:31.880\n that the double blind,\n\n1:53:31.880 --> 1:53:34.000\n there was no solution to the double blind problem.\n\n1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:37.040\n And both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency\n\n1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:39.680\n in the end agreed that the best design\n\n1:53:39.680 --> 1:53:41.800\n was therapy with inactive placebo\n\n1:53:41.800 --> 1:53:43.800\n versus therapy with full dose MDMA,\n\n1:53:43.800 --> 1:53:47.120\n accepting the fact that most people will be able to tell\n\n1:53:47.120 --> 1:53:50.240\n whether they got nothing or they got full dose MDMA.\n\n1:53:50.240 --> 1:53:52.400\n Most therapists will be able to tell the difference,\n\n1:53:52.400 --> 1:53:55.880\n but that makes a harder test for us\n\n1:53:55.880 --> 1:53:57.760\n to show a difference between the two groups\n\n1:53:57.760 --> 1:54:00.120\n because we're giving them inactive placebo\n\n1:54:00.120 --> 1:54:03.960\n and not the anti therapeutic effect of low dose MDMA.\n\n1:54:03.960 --> 1:54:06.080\n So once we started phase three,\n\n1:54:06.080 --> 1:54:10.520\n so then we were able to start in 2018 phase three.\n\n1:54:10.520 --> 1:54:13.680\n And the paper in Nature Medicine that just came out\n\n1:54:13.680 --> 1:54:18.160\n was the results of our first phase three study.\n\n1:54:18.160 --> 1:54:20.240\n We came to agreement with FDA\n\n1:54:20.240 --> 1:54:22.680\n that we would do two phase three studies,\n\n1:54:22.680 --> 1:54:24.880\n each would have 100 persons in them.\n\n1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:29.240\n And what the FDA said to us is that they thought\n\n1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:33.520\n that we could prove efficacy with smaller numbers\n\n1:54:33.520 --> 1:54:36.400\n than they wanted to see for safety.\n\n1:54:36.400 --> 1:54:38.880\n The reason they said that is it in phase two,\n\n1:54:38.880 --> 1:54:41.360\n we had a large effect size.\n\n1:54:41.360 --> 1:54:43.440\n So from a statistical point of view,\n\n1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:47.040\n the bigger of an effect that you're looking for,\n\n1:54:47.040 --> 1:54:49.080\n the fewer number of people you need\n\n1:54:49.080 --> 1:54:51.360\n to get statistical significance.\n\n1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:53.320\n When you're trying to find small differences,\n\n1:54:53.320 --> 1:54:54.800\n you need large numbers of people\n\n1:54:54.800 --> 1:54:57.900\n to sort of work out the noise.\n\n1:54:59.800 --> 1:55:04.240\n So we came to agreement on two 100 person phase three studies.\n\n1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:07.480\n And the idea is that it's very possible\n\n1:55:07.480 --> 1:55:11.160\n that the first study would show the efficacy\n\n1:55:11.160 --> 1:55:13.120\n because the effect is so strong.\n\n1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:16.120\n Yeah, yeah, and the second, but also safety as well.\n\n1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:19.600\n So one of the things we also realized\n\n1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:22.400\n when you work with a highly stigmatized drug\n\n1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:26.920\n in the midst of still the drug war and prohibition\n\n1:55:26.920 --> 1:55:31.280\n that we need highly sympathetic subjects\n\n1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:34.020\n and we need to make the best case we can,\n\n1:55:34.020 --> 1:55:37.040\n which means we need to work with the hardest cases\n\n1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:38.400\n so that this is really needed.\n\n1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:40.920\n And so we end up enrolling people.\n\n1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:45.040\n The first study was chronic severe PTSD.\n\n1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:47.280\n And unlike many studies of PTSD,\n\n1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:50.640\n we enroll people that have previously attempted suicide.\n\n1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:51.480\n Wow.\n\n1:55:51.480 --> 1:55:53.040\n So we have multiple people\n\n1:55:53.040 --> 1:55:54.560\n that have tried to kill themselves\n\n1:55:54.560 --> 1:55:57.520\n that we felt like if we were to exclude them,\n\n1:55:57.520 --> 1:55:58.440\n what are we doing?\n\n1:55:58.440 --> 1:56:00.520\n Those are the people that need it the most.\n\n1:56:00.520 --> 1:56:04.320\n So we came to this agreement with FDA.\n\n1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:09.120\n We're gonna work with chronic severe PTSD patients,\n\n1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:11.600\n including those that had attempted suicide.\n\n1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:14.840\n And we would do these two 100 person studies.\n\n1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:19.760\n And we also negotiated what's called an interim analysis.\n\n1:56:19.760 --> 1:56:22.240\n So what that means is that\n\n1:56:22.240 --> 1:56:26.800\n when the study is underway,\n\n1:56:26.800 --> 1:56:28.640\n and often big, big studies,\n\n1:56:28.640 --> 1:56:30.360\n they have this kind of interim analysis\n\n1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:31.600\n where what you do is,\n\n1:56:31.600 --> 1:56:35.120\n and for us, we negotiate when we had 60% or 60 people\n\n1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:37.440\n had reached the primary outcome measure\n\n1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:39.880\n and all 100 had been enrolled,\n\n1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:42.040\n then we would take a look at the data.\n\n1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:46.960\n And if the statistical analysis that we did\n\n1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:51.960\n was showing based on a certain effect size that we chose\n\n1:56:52.680 --> 1:56:55.040\n based on what we saw in phase two,\n\n1:56:55.040 --> 1:56:56.080\n the interim analysis\n\n1:56:56.080 --> 1:56:59.240\n is for what's called sample size reestimation.\n\n1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:01.200\n So what it means is if the results aren't as good\n\n1:57:01.200 --> 1:57:04.080\n as you thought they would, you can add more people.\n\n1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:07.720\n And then you'll get statistical significance.\n\n1:57:07.720 --> 1:57:10.440\n It means that your effect isn't as strong as you thought.\n\n1:57:10.440 --> 1:57:12.360\n It'll be harder to get insurance to cover it,\n\n1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:14.400\n but FDA will still approve it\n\n1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:18.760\n because FDA also believes that these are group averages.\n\n1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:20.760\n There may be some people that will later figure out\n\n1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:22.480\n respond better than others.\n\n1:57:22.480 --> 1:57:25.080\n So they'll approve it if it's statistically significant,\n\n1:57:25.080 --> 1:57:27.240\n even if it has a low effect size.\n\n1:57:27.240 --> 1:57:30.120\n The SSRIs have low effect size.\n\n1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:35.120\n So we did the interim analysis in March of 2020.\n\n1:57:35.840 --> 1:57:38.080\n And what we discovered to our delight\n\n1:57:38.080 --> 1:57:41.760\n was that we did not need to add any subjects.\n\n1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:42.800\n That's all we were told.\n\n1:57:42.800 --> 1:57:45.800\n We weren't told like, what is the results?\n\n1:57:45.800 --> 1:57:48.680\n We were just told all we were gonna get is a number, zero,\n\n1:57:48.680 --> 1:57:50.960\n or you need to add X numbers of people to the study\n\n1:57:50.960 --> 1:57:53.200\n to get statistical significance.\n\n1:57:53.200 --> 1:57:55.400\n That's right around the time that COVID hit\n\n1:57:55.400 --> 1:57:56.720\n and lockdowns happened.\n\n1:57:56.720 --> 1:57:59.240\n And we ended up negotiating with FDA\n\n1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:02.600\n that we would end the study with 90 people instead of 100.\n\n1:58:04.800 --> 1:58:06.680\n It took a while for us to end up doing that.\n\n1:58:06.680 --> 1:58:08.360\n So the paper that we just published\n\n1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:10.960\n is on the results of 90 people.\n\n1:58:10.960 --> 1:58:13.280\n I think it was 46 in the MDMA group,\n\n1:58:13.280 --> 1:58:15.440\n 44 in the placebo group.\n\n1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:21.400\n And what we discovered was that the study worked better\n\n1:58:21.400 --> 1:58:23.280\n than we had even hoped.\n\n1:58:23.280 --> 1:58:25.520\n So the first thing is that\n\n1:58:25.520 --> 1:58:27.240\n you look at statistical significance.\n\n1:58:27.240 --> 1:58:28.560\n You have to get 0.05,\n\n1:58:28.560 --> 1:58:30.600\n which basically means a nickel out of a dollar,\n\n1:58:30.600 --> 1:58:33.160\n a one in 20 chance that the difference\n\n1:58:33.160 --> 1:58:36.320\n between the two groups is due to some random factor\n\n1:58:36.320 --> 1:58:38.200\n rather than to your intervention.\n\n1:58:38.200 --> 1:58:42.040\n And in this case, the placebo group gets therapy\n\n1:58:42.920 --> 1:58:44.800\n and then with inactive placebo\n\n1:58:44.800 --> 1:58:49.200\n and then the group gets MDMA with active placebo.\n\n1:58:49.200 --> 1:58:52.200\n So you have to get 0.05.\n\n1:58:52.200 --> 1:58:53.800\n There's another measure\n\n1:58:53.800 --> 1:58:56.840\n that the FDA uses sometimes called robust,\n\n1:58:56.840 --> 1:58:59.520\n which means one in a thousand,\n\n1:58:59.520 --> 1:59:01.600\n instead of one in 20, one in a thousand.\n\n1:59:01.600 --> 1:59:06.600\n And if you get a robust results, 0.001,\n\n1:59:06.680 --> 1:59:08.400\n and you meet some other criteria,\n\n1:59:09.440 --> 1:59:11.520\n they might agree to approve the drug\n\n1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:15.120\n on the basis of just one phase three study instead of two.\n\n1:59:15.120 --> 1:59:16.600\n Because when you think about it,\n\n1:59:16.600 --> 1:59:20.160\n a one in 20 chance for your first phase three study,\n\n1:59:20.160 --> 1:59:23.200\n a one in 20 chance for your second phase three study,\n\n1:59:23.200 --> 1:59:28.120\n you multiply that together, it's one in 400, 0.025.\n\n1:59:28.120 --> 1:59:32.680\n So that's pretty good.\n\n1:59:32.680 --> 1:59:35.760\n So robust 0.001 is even better\n\n1:59:35.760 --> 1:59:40.080\n than two independent phase three studies, each at 0.05.\n\n1:59:41.160 --> 1:59:45.600\n What we ended up getting was one in 10,000, 0.0001.\n\n1:59:46.560 --> 1:59:49.400\n Outrageous, incredibly.\n\n1:59:49.400 --> 1:59:51.440\n So that's a measure of both the difference\n\n1:59:51.440 --> 1:59:53.560\n between the two groups and the variability.\n\n1:59:53.560 --> 1:59:58.560\n And so what it meant is that we had minimal variability,\n\n1:59:58.600 --> 2:00:00.400\n that most people who got the MDA\n\n2:00:00.400 --> 2:00:03.480\n got quite a large amount of benefit from it.\n\n2:00:03.480 --> 2:00:05.160\n And most people who got the placebo\n\n2:00:05.160 --> 2:00:07.320\n were more or less in the same range as well.\n\n2:00:07.320 --> 2:00:08.920\n That's really exciting, by the way.\n\n2:00:08.920 --> 2:00:13.520\n I mean, I suppose it's exciting\n\n2:00:13.520 --> 2:00:16.440\n from a perspective of approval by the FDA.\n\n2:00:16.440 --> 2:00:18.280\n Maybe perhaps that's the way you're seeing it,\n\n2:00:18.280 --> 2:00:22.960\n but it's also exciting because it has a chance\n\n2:00:22.960 --> 2:00:26.000\n to help people that are truly suffering, yeah.\n\n2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:29.040\n Well, if we can get one in 10,000\n\n2:00:29.040 --> 2:00:31.360\n in the first phase three study,\n\n2:00:31.360 --> 2:00:34.440\n chances are we can get one in 20 in the second.\n\n2:00:34.440 --> 2:00:36.960\n So it's really gonna be about safety for us\n\n2:00:36.960 --> 2:00:38.520\n in the second phase three study.\n\n2:00:39.800 --> 2:00:44.800\n Now, you can have a large P value, a large significance,\n\n2:00:45.720 --> 2:00:49.720\n but you could have an effect that's not very significant.\n\n2:00:49.720 --> 2:00:51.160\n It's not clinically significant.\n\n2:00:51.160 --> 2:00:52.840\n You can have statistical significance\n\n2:00:52.840 --> 2:00:55.400\n without clinical significance.\n\n2:00:55.400 --> 2:00:58.040\n And as I said, the more people you get in the study,\n\n2:00:58.040 --> 2:00:59.960\n you can find smaller and smaller differences\n\n2:00:59.960 --> 2:01:01.120\n between two groups.\n\n2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:07.040\n Now, we showed that we had a very large effect size.\n\n2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:10.280\n So effect size is based on...\n\n2:01:10.280 --> 2:01:11.480\n That scale you mentioned?\n\n2:01:11.480 --> 2:01:13.560\n Well, the scale of the effect size\n\n2:01:13.560 --> 2:01:17.320\n is based on standard deviations.\n\n2:01:17.320 --> 2:01:20.400\n So an effect size of one means that your results\n\n2:01:20.400 --> 2:01:23.320\n are one standard deviation away from the norm.\n\n2:01:23.320 --> 2:01:25.000\n That's considered very large.\n\n2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:31.320\n The SSRIs, because they were like 0.3, 0.4 effect size,\n\n2:01:32.240 --> 2:01:34.120\n that's considered small effect size.\n\n2:01:34.120 --> 2:01:36.920\n Medium is starting to be around 0.6\n\n2:01:36.920 --> 2:01:40.040\n and 0.8 and above are large effect sizes.\n\n2:01:41.400 --> 2:01:45.680\n We had what's called placebo subtracted effect size.\n\n2:01:45.680 --> 2:01:46.880\n There's two different ways to look at it.\n\n2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:49.440\n Placebo subtracted means you kind of look at the difference\n\n2:01:49.440 --> 2:01:50.720\n between your two groups.\n\n2:01:51.600 --> 2:01:54.480\n And what that is for us, since one group had therapy\n\n2:01:54.480 --> 2:01:56.240\n and one had therapy plus MDMA,\n\n2:01:56.240 --> 2:01:58.880\n the placebo subtracted effect size\n\n2:01:58.880 --> 2:02:01.120\n is basically the effect of just the MDMA\n\n2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:03.600\n because you've kind of washed out the therapy.\n\n2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:05.240\n That was 0.91.\n\n2:02:05.240 --> 2:02:08.440\n So we had a large effect size, which was different.\n\n2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:13.040\n Wow, so 0.91 over just the therapy, so over the placebo.\n\n2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:13.960\n Yeah. Wow.\n\n2:02:13.960 --> 2:02:17.440\n Now, when we do the within group,\n\n2:02:17.440 --> 2:02:21.560\n meaning the group that just got the MDMA plus therapy,\n\n2:02:21.560 --> 2:02:23.920\n look at their baseline and their outcomes.\n\n2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:25.320\n That's another way to look at it.\n\n2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:27.440\n And that's what's gonna actually happen in practice\n\n2:02:27.440 --> 2:02:30.880\n because people are gonna get MDMA plus therapy.\n\n2:02:30.880 --> 2:02:32.680\n That's 2.1 effect size.\n\n2:02:32.680 --> 2:02:35.000\n Two standard deviations away from the norm\n\n2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:36.600\n is enormous effect size.\n\n2:02:38.200 --> 2:02:43.200\n The other part is that we had no effect by site,\n\n2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:44.960\n which is very important.\n\n2:02:44.960 --> 2:02:47.720\n So we had 15 sites, two in Israel, two in Canada,\n\n2:02:47.720 --> 2:02:49.520\n 11 throughout the United States.\n\n2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:53.320\n The FDA looks at, is there a side effect?\n\n2:02:53.320 --> 2:02:54.600\n Because what that might mean is\n\n2:02:54.600 --> 2:02:56.280\n maybe you've got all your patients\n\n2:02:56.280 --> 2:02:58.240\n or most of your patients going to this one site,\n\n2:02:58.240 --> 2:03:01.000\n which is these highly experienced therapists\n\n2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:03.160\n and they're like hippies from way back\n\n2:03:03.160 --> 2:03:05.120\n and they're super experienced with psychedelics\n\n2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:07.360\n and they're getting great results,\n\n2:03:07.360 --> 2:03:09.240\n but nobody else gets good results.\n\n2:03:09.240 --> 2:03:11.080\n So we had no effect by site.\n\n2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:12.320\n That's incredible.\n\n2:03:12.320 --> 2:03:14.920\n That we've been able to train all these new therapists.\n\n2:03:14.920 --> 2:03:19.920\n We had about 80 therapists working at all these 15 sites.\n\n2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:23.560\n We also discovered that there's a group\n\n2:03:23.560 --> 2:03:26.960\n that's considered to be very difficult to treat,\n\n2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:29.960\n which is called the dissociative subtype.\n\n2:03:29.960 --> 2:03:32.960\n So when people are traumatized,\n\n2:03:32.960 --> 2:03:37.720\n one of the ways to psychologically survive that\n\n2:03:37.720 --> 2:03:38.960\n is you dissociate.\n\n2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:41.040\n It's like you're not there.\n\n2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:43.480\n When you do that though, it's hard to come back\n\n2:03:43.480 --> 2:03:45.000\n because when you come back,\n\n2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.520\n then you get all these painful memories and fearful.\n\n2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:50.320\n And so the extreme of that\n\n2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:53.120\n is called dissociative identity disorder,\n\n2:03:53.120 --> 2:03:56.440\n kind of like schizophrenia, almost dissociative identity.\n\n2:03:56.440 --> 2:04:01.080\n So we let people in who are on the dissociative subtype\n\n2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:03.120\n and those are considered to be the hardest to treat\n\n2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:07.720\n because the theory is that you need to be ego intact.\n\n2:04:07.720 --> 2:04:10.200\n As I said, the mystical experience is not correlated\n\n2:04:10.200 --> 2:04:11.240\n with therapeutic outcomes.\n\n2:04:11.240 --> 2:04:13.800\n And you need to be talking about what traumatized you\n\n2:04:13.800 --> 2:04:15.800\n and working through that and expressing it,\n\n2:04:15.800 --> 2:04:18.000\n letting it out, not keeping it in.\n\n2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:22.520\n So the dissociative subtype seems like it's harder\n\n2:04:22.520 --> 2:04:24.480\n for them to get back into the event\n\n2:04:24.480 --> 2:04:26.240\n because they're so dissociated.\n\n2:04:26.240 --> 2:04:29.040\n What we showed is that those people did even better\n\n2:04:29.040 --> 2:04:31.400\n on average than everybody else.\n\n2:04:31.400 --> 2:04:33.200\n So that MDMA is integrative.\n\n2:04:33.200 --> 2:04:36.920\n It helps people who are so separate\n\n2:04:36.920 --> 2:04:39.080\n that they make even more rapid progress.\n\n2:04:39.080 --> 2:04:41.960\n So it's almost like the MDMA made it more difficult\n\n2:04:41.960 --> 2:04:43.440\n for them to dissociate.\n\n2:04:43.440 --> 2:04:44.280\n Yes.\n\n2:04:44.280 --> 2:04:45.760\n Yeah, or you could say it made it easier\n\n2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:47.200\n for them to remember.\n\n2:04:47.200 --> 2:04:48.280\n Yes, exactly.\n\n2:04:48.280 --> 2:04:49.520\n To reverse the dissociation.\n\n2:04:49.520 --> 2:04:50.360\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:50.360 --> 2:04:53.560\n And we find that MDMA enhances memory for the trauma\n\n2:04:54.600 --> 2:04:57.600\n so that you can have these unconscious memories\n\n2:04:57.600 --> 2:04:59.440\n or memories that you cannot remember\n\n2:04:59.440 --> 2:05:00.920\n or that you've suppressed so much,\n\n2:05:00.920 --> 2:05:02.560\n but they distort your view.\n\n2:05:02.560 --> 2:05:04.720\n Your filter of the world is distorted\n\n2:05:04.720 --> 2:05:07.400\n by these fearful memories that the world can't be trusted.\n\n2:05:07.400 --> 2:05:08.400\n People can't be trusted.\n\n2:05:08.400 --> 2:05:10.040\n It's always about to happen.\n\n2:05:10.040 --> 2:05:13.640\n So we find that MDMA increases memory for the trauma,\n\n2:05:13.640 --> 2:05:15.280\n but by reducing the fear,\n\n2:05:15.280 --> 2:05:16.880\n then the memories can come to the surface.\n\n2:05:16.880 --> 2:05:18.960\n Then you can process them, let out the emotions,\n\n2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:21.480\n cry, scream, shake, whatever.\n\n2:05:21.480 --> 2:05:24.480\n And then through this MDMA effect\n\n2:05:24.480 --> 2:05:26.040\n on the amygdala and the hippocampus,\n\n2:05:26.040 --> 2:05:29.400\n it helps you store these memories into longterm storage\n\n2:05:29.400 --> 2:05:31.320\n so that they're not always about to happen.\n\n2:05:31.320 --> 2:05:32.600\n They're in the past.\n\n2:05:32.600 --> 2:05:35.320\n They're part of your story, but they're not the whole story.\n\n2:05:35.320 --> 2:05:38.640\n So we discovered that the dissociative subtype works better.\n\n2:05:38.640 --> 2:05:42.800\n Now, none of this would be enough unless safety.\n\n2:05:42.800 --> 2:05:45.000\n So from a safety perspective,\n\n2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:48.040\n what we discovered is that there was one woman in the study\n\n2:05:48.040 --> 2:05:52.040\n that attempted to kill herself twice during the study.\n\n2:05:52.040 --> 2:05:57.040\n There was another woman that was so worried\n\n2:05:57.200 --> 2:05:58.400\n that she might kill herself,\n\n2:05:58.400 --> 2:06:00.480\n that the therapy brought these things to the surface\n\n2:06:00.480 --> 2:06:01.600\n that she's been pushing away,\n\n2:06:01.600 --> 2:06:03.920\n that she checked herself into a hospital\n\n2:06:03.920 --> 2:06:05.720\n in order to avoid self harm.\n\n2:06:06.800 --> 2:06:08.200\n At the end of the study,\n\n2:06:08.200 --> 2:06:11.840\n what we learned is both of them were in the placebo group.\n\n2:06:11.840 --> 2:06:14.280\n We didn't have anybody in the MDMA group\n\n2:06:14.280 --> 2:06:15.720\n attempt to kill themselves.\n\n2:06:16.920 --> 2:06:21.080\n So the MDMA is really helpful\n\n2:06:21.080 --> 2:06:23.200\n for giving people a sense of hope\n\n2:06:24.160 --> 2:06:27.120\n and that they can somehow process this.\n\n2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:30.800\n Now, it's not to say that nobody will ever commit suicide.\n\n2:06:30.800 --> 2:06:34.200\n That's our big concern in the second phase three study.\n\n2:06:34.200 --> 2:06:36.000\n As I said, it's more gonna be about safety\n\n2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:37.000\n than about efficacy.\n\n2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:38.360\n We think we'll get the efficacy,\n\n2:06:38.360 --> 2:06:42.200\n but we're very concerned about safety.\n\n2:06:42.200 --> 2:06:46.320\n Because we had problems in the first phase three study\n\n2:06:46.320 --> 2:06:47.760\n of somebody trying to kill herself twice\n\n2:06:47.760 --> 2:06:48.760\n in the placebo group,\n\n2:06:49.960 --> 2:06:52.920\n it's the background for having PTSD.\n\n2:06:52.920 --> 2:06:55.480\n So there'd have to be a disproportionate number of people\n\n2:06:55.480 --> 2:06:57.400\n in the MDMA group try to kill themselves\n\n2:06:57.400 --> 2:06:58.800\n or succeed in killing themselves\n\n2:06:58.800 --> 2:07:01.440\n than in the placebo group for the FDA to say,\n\n2:07:01.440 --> 2:07:04.320\n oh, this MDMA, it's too dangerous.\n\n2:07:04.320 --> 2:07:05.920\n We don't think that's gonna happen.\n\n2:07:05.920 --> 2:07:10.920\n So the other findings from safety\n\n2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:13.240\n is that the side effects are transitory.\n\n2:07:13.240 --> 2:07:17.760\n They're minor, they're sweating or jaw clenching\n\n2:07:17.760 --> 2:07:19.760\n or a slight temperature increase.\n\n2:07:19.760 --> 2:07:23.040\n And everybody that's been to a rave knows about it.\n\n2:07:23.040 --> 2:07:26.200\n Take an ecstasy, there are some side effects.\n\n2:07:26.200 --> 2:07:27.640\n But they're minor, they're transitory\n\n2:07:27.640 --> 2:07:30.920\n and there has been this massive problem\n\n2:07:30.920 --> 2:07:33.440\n of during the eighties, the nineties,\n\n2:07:33.440 --> 2:07:34.920\n NIDA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse\n\n2:07:34.920 --> 2:07:37.760\n was trying to say that MDMA was neurotoxic\n\n2:07:37.760 --> 2:07:38.840\n and that you take it\n\n2:07:38.840 --> 2:07:41.200\n and it's gonna cause nerve terminal degeneration.\n\n2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:42.960\n It's gonna be major brain damage.\n\n2:07:42.960 --> 2:07:45.400\n It's gonna be significant functional consequences.\n\n2:07:45.400 --> 2:07:48.520\n And back then they were saying that MDMA is too dangerous.\n\n2:07:48.520 --> 2:07:49.960\n It should never even be researched.\n\n2:07:49.960 --> 2:07:51.400\n Nobody should even get it once\n\n2:07:51.400 --> 2:07:54.120\n because it's poison and brain damage.\n\n2:07:54.120 --> 2:07:57.560\n Well, we no longer believe that, that was exaggerated.\n\n2:07:57.560 --> 2:08:00.840\n That was in service of the drug war.\n\n2:08:00.840 --> 2:08:04.520\n But we've done in phase two neurocognitive tests\n\n2:08:04.520 --> 2:08:07.320\n before and after in two of our different sites\n\n2:08:07.320 --> 2:08:09.880\n and showed no decline in cognitive functioning.\n\n2:08:09.880 --> 2:08:14.680\n So we don't think that there's any neurotoxicity happening\n\n2:08:14.680 --> 2:08:16.760\n and the doses that we use.\n\n2:08:16.760 --> 2:08:18.800\n There's no obvious functional consequences.\n\n2:08:18.800 --> 2:08:20.240\n People are getting better.\n\n2:08:20.240 --> 2:08:24.160\n And the other thing that we've learned in phase two\n\n2:08:24.160 --> 2:08:25.720\n and that we still have to learn from this study.\n\n2:08:25.720 --> 2:08:29.400\n So what we showed is the durability of the effect.\n\n2:08:29.400 --> 2:08:32.160\n We showed that 32% of the people\n\n2:08:32.160 --> 2:08:34.440\n that got the therapy without MDMA\n\n2:08:34.440 --> 2:08:36.880\n at two months after the last experimental session\n\n2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:38.840\n no longer had PTSD.\n\n2:08:38.840 --> 2:08:41.160\n Just with the therapy, which is phenomenal\n\n2:08:41.160 --> 2:08:44.200\n because these are on average 14 years PTSD,\n\n2:08:44.200 --> 2:08:46.320\n one third had PTSD over 20 years.\n\n2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:51.120\n And just with the therapy,\n\n2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:54.640\n 32% no longer had PTSD at the two months.\n\n2:08:54.640 --> 2:08:58.440\n However, those people that got MDMA, it was 67%.\n\n2:08:58.440 --> 2:09:02.320\n No longer had PTSD, more than twice as good.\n\n2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:04.840\n In phase two and in phase three,\n\n2:09:04.840 --> 2:09:07.600\n we're also gonna do the 12 month followup.\n\n2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:09.320\n That's not for the FDA.\n\n2:09:09.320 --> 2:09:10.760\n That's not for approvability.\n\n2:09:10.760 --> 2:09:12.400\n That's more for insurance companies\n\n2:09:12.400 --> 2:09:15.360\n because this is expensive, a lot of therapy time.\n\n2:09:15.360 --> 2:09:18.080\n If it fades, if it's great results initially\n\n2:09:18.080 --> 2:09:20.880\n but then it fades after six months, what's the point?\n\n2:09:20.880 --> 2:09:24.880\n And what we showed in phase two\n\n2:09:24.880 --> 2:09:28.960\n is that people keep getting better.\n\n2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:31.960\n At the two month followup, they're doing pretty well\n\n2:09:31.960 --> 2:09:34.960\n but at the 12 month followup, they're even better.\n\n2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:35.960\n So it's durable.\n\n2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:38.440\n People have learned how to process trauma.\n\n2:09:38.440 --> 2:09:39.280\n They keep getting better.\n\n2:09:39.280 --> 2:09:41.680\n So we've not reached that point in this phase three study\n\n2:09:41.680 --> 2:09:43.440\n where everybody's got their one year followup.\n\n2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:46.320\n But we have also done three and a half year followups\n\n2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:48.840\n to some of the groups that were in phase two\n\n2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:50.600\n and showed that it was durable.\n\n2:09:50.600 --> 2:09:53.040\n And we're doing a long term followup now\n\n2:09:53.040 --> 2:09:55.280\n to many of the people in phase two,\n\n2:09:55.280 --> 2:09:57.640\n some of them treated 15 years ago.\n\n2:09:57.640 --> 2:09:59.960\n So that's all more for the insurance companies.\n\n2:09:59.960 --> 2:10:02.800\n So basically what we found in the paper\n\n2:10:02.800 --> 2:10:05.360\n that we just published is that it was highly efficacious,\n\n2:10:05.360 --> 2:10:07.920\n highly significant, no effect by sight,\n\n2:10:07.920 --> 2:10:12.280\n works in the hardest cases and the safety record was great.\n\n2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:14.640\n That's an incredible success.\n\n2:10:14.640 --> 2:10:17.640\n And that's really exciting, especially given\n\n2:10:17.640 --> 2:10:21.720\n that the people who've committed, who attempted\n\n2:10:21.720 --> 2:10:23.920\n to commit suicide were let into the study.\n\n2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:26.800\n And so these are people who are truly suffering.\n\n2:10:30.120 --> 2:10:35.120\n I mean, that's incredibly exciting.\n\n2:10:36.120 --> 2:10:38.360\n And I mean, just to speak to the frustration\n\n2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:39.920\n why things can't move faster,\n\n2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:44.920\n but for what it is, it's incredibly exciting.\n\n2:10:44.920 --> 2:10:48.160\n Is there other studies of this nature\n\n2:10:48.160 --> 2:10:51.160\n that you foresee enabling that same kind\n\n2:10:51.160 --> 2:10:53.480\n of positive impact, whether it's MDMA\n\n2:10:53.480 --> 2:10:55.360\n for other things like treating addiction,\n\n2:10:55.360 --> 2:10:59.400\n or maybe it's psilocybin for other conditions?\n\n2:10:59.400 --> 2:11:01.160\n Is there something else that's promising?\n\n2:11:01.160 --> 2:11:05.800\n Yeah, I think that what we've discovered\n\n2:11:05.800 --> 2:11:08.920\n I don't think is unique to MDMA.\n\n2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:12.360\n So it's MDMA assisted psychotherapy.\n\n2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:15.560\n MDMA is ideal for PTSD.\n\n2:11:15.560 --> 2:11:18.920\n Maybe it won't work as well for OCD or other things.\n\n2:11:18.920 --> 2:11:21.040\n It was very strategic why we chose MDMA\n\n2:11:21.040 --> 2:11:22.720\n and why we chose PTSD.\n\n2:11:23.640 --> 2:11:26.400\n But I don't think that the results that we've got\n\n2:11:26.400 --> 2:11:29.160\n are so unique to MDMA assisted therapy.\n\n2:11:29.160 --> 2:11:31.320\n I think that psilocybin assisted therapy\n\n2:11:31.320 --> 2:11:33.720\n is gonna be great for people\n\n2:11:33.720 --> 2:11:35.560\n with life threatening illnesses,\n\n2:11:35.560 --> 2:11:37.920\n cancer who are anxious about dying.\n\n2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:39.480\n It looks like it's really good\n\n2:11:39.480 --> 2:11:41.040\n in the treatment of addiction.\n\n2:11:41.040 --> 2:11:44.480\n Again, these are in combination\n\n2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:47.120\n with sort of the psilocybin tobacco\n\n2:11:47.120 --> 2:11:49.920\n is cognitive behavioral therapy with psilocybin.\n\n2:11:51.480 --> 2:11:54.000\n I think that it's gonna be a little bit more difficult,\n\n2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:55.680\n psilocybin for depression.\n\n2:11:55.680 --> 2:11:58.400\n I don't know if it'll be quite as good.\n\n2:11:58.400 --> 2:12:01.880\n There are some biological aspects sometimes to depression,\n\n2:12:01.880 --> 2:12:03.480\n but I think that there'll be really good results\n\n2:12:03.480 --> 2:12:04.880\n for psilocybin for depression.\n\n2:12:04.880 --> 2:12:05.960\n I think it'll be approved.\n\n2:12:05.960 --> 2:12:09.080\n It's considered a breakthrough therapy by the FDA.\n\n2:12:09.080 --> 2:12:12.320\n Ibogaine is phenomenal for opiate addiction,\n\n2:12:12.320 --> 2:12:14.000\n helping people go through withdrawal\n\n2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:15.800\n and then giving them this chance\n\n2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:20.800\n to deal with the material that drives them for addiction.\n\n2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:23.600\n There was Ben Sessa, Dr. Ben Sessa in England\n\n2:12:23.600 --> 2:12:26.440\n did MDMA for alcohol use disorder.\n\n2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:28.640\n And that was really great, the results he got.\n\n2:12:28.640 --> 2:12:31.760\n And it's the case that he ended up\n\n2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:33.440\n basically treating people for trauma.\n\n2:12:33.440 --> 2:12:35.320\n It's the trauma that people run,\n\n2:12:35.320 --> 2:12:37.680\n the emotional challenges that people run from\n\n2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:42.680\n into quieting that pain through drug addiction or alcoholism.\n\n2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:44.960\n So trauma is behind a lot of addiction.\n\n2:12:44.960 --> 2:12:49.960\n I think that we are going to see a revolution in psychiatry\n\n2:12:50.680 --> 2:12:54.760\n and that there will be a lot of conditions\n\n2:12:54.760 --> 2:12:59.320\n that have left a lot of people still suffering\n\n2:12:59.320 --> 2:13:01.240\n that psychedelic assisted therapy,\n\n2:13:01.240 --> 2:13:03.080\n different psychedelics, different approaches.\n\n2:13:03.080 --> 2:13:06.360\n But I think that we will see a lot of hope\n\n2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:08.040\n for psychiatry and psychotherapy\n\n2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:09.720\n and that psychedelics would be a big part\n\n2:13:09.720 --> 2:13:13.680\n of changing the practice of psychiatry and psychotherapy.\n\n2:13:13.680 --> 2:13:15.820\n Yeah, this is really to me fascinating.\n\n2:13:15.820 --> 2:13:19.180\n So I actually, when I was younger,\n\n2:13:19.180 --> 2:13:21.920\n for the longest time, wanted to be a psychiatrist.\n\n2:13:21.920 --> 2:13:24.740\n So I was excited by psychotherapy,\n\n2:13:24.740 --> 2:13:28.160\n but then I perhaps incorrectly, maybe you can correct me,\n\n2:13:28.160 --> 2:13:30.600\n but became more and more cynical\n\n2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:33.520\n because it felt like it was more about prescribing drugs\n\n2:13:33.520 --> 2:13:34.560\n than psychotherapy.\n\n2:13:34.560 --> 2:13:36.360\n I'm not going to correct you.\n\n2:13:36.360 --> 2:13:39.760\n I mean, right now, there is a crisis in psychiatry\n\n2:13:39.760 --> 2:13:42.440\n that there are so many psychiatrists that are so fed up\n\n2:13:42.440 --> 2:13:45.740\n because they have been pharmaceuticalized.\n\n2:13:45.740 --> 2:13:47.400\n They meet people for 15 minutes,\n\n2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:49.200\n they adjust their medications.\n\n2:13:49.200 --> 2:13:51.360\n This is the way they make the most money,\n\n2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:53.760\n but they've lost the art of talking to people.\n\n2:13:55.760 --> 2:13:58.600\n And that's why we see that so many young psychiatric\n\n2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:02.920\n residents are so thrilled by psychedelics\n\n2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:05.640\n that they really want to get back to treating people\n\n2:14:05.640 --> 2:14:08.320\n as individuals, not just a bunch of chemicals.\n\n2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:09.600\n Yeah, that's truly fascinating.\n\n2:14:09.600 --> 2:14:11.640\n Because the reason it was appealing to me,\n\n2:14:11.640 --> 2:14:14.760\n it was a way to study the human mind\n\n2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:18.400\n and to see ways through talking\n\n2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:22.720\n that you can make people feel better,\n\n2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:28.000\n make people better, make people suffer less.\n\n2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:30.920\n And that was really exciting at the time.\n\n2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:33.680\n I ended up then going to AI because then\n\n2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:35.680\n I can understand the mind from that angle.\n\n2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:39.920\n But it's exciting that that could be also\n\n2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:43.900\n revolutionized the field of psychotherapy,\n\n2:14:43.900 --> 2:14:47.040\n take it from its back to its origins,\n\n2:14:47.040 --> 2:14:51.160\n to where a psychiatrist would be a scholar of the mind.\n\n2:14:51.160 --> 2:14:53.880\n Yeah, well, Freud talked about dreams\n\n2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:56.440\n as the railroad to the unconscious.\n\n2:14:56.440 --> 2:14:57.600\n And there was a lot of,\n\n2:14:57.600 --> 2:15:00.920\n you really spent a lot of time with people.\n\n2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:05.800\n Now, right before he died, in his last book,\n\n2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:07.580\n Freud wrote something, and again,\n\n2:15:07.580 --> 2:15:09.400\n this will be a rough paraphrase,\n\n2:15:09.400 --> 2:15:11.520\n but he said that in the future,\n\n2:15:11.520 --> 2:15:15.680\n we may learn about the energies of the brain\n\n2:15:15.680 --> 2:15:18.480\n and there'll be ways with chemicals to influence that\n\n2:15:18.480 --> 2:15:21.880\n that will help the therapeutic process.\n\n2:15:21.880 --> 2:15:22.720\n Yeah.\n\n2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:27.720\n So you could say he was ahead of his time.\n\n2:15:27.760 --> 2:15:28.600\n Yeah.\n\n2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:32.440\n This study paints a fascinating picture of a future\n\n2:15:33.600 --> 2:15:35.760\n where first for medical applications,\n\n2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:39.300\n but then also in general, psychedelics of various forms\n\n2:15:39.300 --> 2:15:42.300\n could be used by the broader society.\n\n2:15:42.300 --> 2:15:44.540\n Forgive the perhaps ridiculous question,\n\n2:15:44.540 --> 2:15:49.540\n but if much of society, including our politicians,\n\n2:15:49.540 --> 2:15:54.540\n are taking psychedelics and dissolving their ego\n\n2:15:56.500 --> 2:15:58.460\n and going through this whole process,\n\n2:15:58.460 --> 2:16:01.940\n how do you think the world may look different\n\n2:16:01.940 --> 2:16:04.740\n in 20, 30, 50 years?\n\n2:16:04.740 --> 2:16:08.100\n Ah, okay, so I said that I think\n\n2:16:08.100 --> 2:16:11.040\n licensed legalization happens in 2035.\n\n2:16:11.040 --> 2:16:11.880\n Yes.\n\n2:16:12.860 --> 2:16:17.860\n And I think by 2050, we will have enough people,\n\n2:16:17.860 --> 2:16:20.920\n hopefully, spiritualized.\n\n2:16:22.100 --> 2:16:23.600\n We're also talking about,\n\n2:16:24.680 --> 2:16:27.280\n we hear so much in terms of climate change\n\n2:16:27.280 --> 2:16:29.980\n about net zero carbon.\n\n2:16:29.980 --> 2:16:33.020\n So our goal is net zero trauma.\n\n2:16:33.020 --> 2:16:35.700\n When do we have a world with net zero trauma?\n\n2:16:35.700 --> 2:16:39.580\n I mean, right now, we have two sites in Israel.\n\n2:16:39.580 --> 2:16:41.220\n So we help a few people,\n\n2:16:41.220 --> 2:16:44.820\n but the recent war with Gaza has traumatized\n\n2:16:44.820 --> 2:16:46.800\n millions of people on both sides.\n\n2:16:46.800 --> 2:16:50.880\n So we are a long way away from net zero trauma.\n\n2:16:52.060 --> 2:16:56.360\n But that's the hope, and that's, I think, possible.\n\n2:16:56.360 --> 2:16:58.640\n I think humanity as a whole\n\n2:17:01.460 --> 2:17:04.620\n is like lemmings heading over a cliff\n\n2:17:04.620 --> 2:17:09.620\n with climate change and with the nuclear proliferation\n\n2:17:09.660 --> 2:17:11.740\n and just the religious hatreds\n\n2:17:11.740 --> 2:17:13.940\n and the more the retreat to authoritarianism\n\n2:17:13.940 --> 2:17:17.120\n and fundamentalism and tribalism.\n\n2:17:17.120 --> 2:17:20.020\n So I think that there's a very good chance, though,\n\n2:17:20.020 --> 2:17:22.700\n that psychedelics used wisely.\n\n2:17:22.700 --> 2:17:25.060\n So it's not just make psychedelics legal\n\n2:17:25.060 --> 2:17:26.380\n and everybody takes them,\n\n2:17:26.380 --> 2:17:28.420\n as you talked about Ted Kaczynski.\n\n2:17:28.420 --> 2:17:31.260\n It's the context that people take it in.\n\n2:17:31.260 --> 2:17:35.340\n But I think that there's a reasonable chance\n\n2:17:35.340 --> 2:17:37.340\n that enough people can,\n\n2:17:38.320 --> 2:17:42.420\n sort of, you could say, clean their filters\n\n2:17:42.420 --> 2:17:47.420\n to see people as more similar to them than different,\n\n2:17:48.620 --> 2:17:50.500\n not to label them as the enemy.\n\n2:17:50.500 --> 2:17:52.460\n Stan Groff, again, had this beautiful phrase\n\n2:17:52.460 --> 2:17:56.580\n about transparent to the transcendent.\n\n2:17:56.580 --> 2:18:00.380\n That's what, so for our ego,\n\n2:18:00.380 --> 2:18:02.900\n can we be transparent to the transcendent?\n\n2:18:02.900 --> 2:18:05.800\n Can the filter that we look through the world at\n\n2:18:05.800 --> 2:18:08.420\n be cleaned to, you could say,\n\n2:18:08.420 --> 2:18:10.460\n cleansing the doors of perception?\n\n2:18:10.460 --> 2:18:12.500\n Can it be cleaned to the point where we can see\n\n2:18:12.500 --> 2:18:15.880\n the humanity in everybody and see that,\n\n2:18:17.420 --> 2:18:19.580\n one way to say this is that,\n\n2:18:19.580 --> 2:18:21.180\n can we get to the point where religions\n\n2:18:21.180 --> 2:18:23.260\n are seen as like languages?\n\n2:18:23.260 --> 2:18:25.880\n Where we all have this need to communicate,\n\n2:18:25.880 --> 2:18:28.500\n there's thousands of different languages,\n\n2:18:28.500 --> 2:18:29.820\n we don't say that this language\n\n2:18:29.820 --> 2:18:32.220\n is fundamentally better than this language,\n\n2:18:32.220 --> 2:18:33.620\n this language is the only right language,\n\n2:18:33.620 --> 2:18:34.960\n everybody must speak English\n\n2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:38.020\n and Russian is bad or German is better.\n\n2:18:38.020 --> 2:18:41.060\n Maybe we'll get to that point that religions are like that,\n\n2:18:41.060 --> 2:18:42.700\n that there are different cultural backgrounds,\n\n2:18:42.700 --> 2:18:44.020\n different symbol systems,\n\n2:18:44.020 --> 2:18:47.060\n different saints and heroes and messiahs and all this,\n\n2:18:47.060 --> 2:18:50.060\n but that, yeah, Jesus is the son of God,\n\n2:18:50.060 --> 2:18:51.540\n but so is everybody.\n\n2:18:52.380 --> 2:18:55.860\n Or the Jews are the chosen people, but so is everybody.\n\n2:18:55.860 --> 2:18:57.540\n So can we get there?\n\n2:18:57.540 --> 2:18:59.380\n I think that we can.\n\n2:18:59.380 --> 2:19:00.980\n And I think that we need to,\n\n2:19:00.980 --> 2:19:03.900\n to survive the challenges that we're facing.\n\n2:19:03.900 --> 2:19:08.100\n And the hope is that by bringing psychedelics\n\n2:19:08.100 --> 2:19:13.100\n as tools forward and trying to bring the context around them\n\n2:19:14.140 --> 2:19:15.720\n to be one of responsibility\n\n2:19:15.720 --> 2:19:18.580\n rather than just profit maximization\n\n2:19:18.580 --> 2:19:20.680\n and just get as many people to do them\n\n2:19:20.680 --> 2:19:22.540\n from all these for profit companies,\n\n2:19:23.460 --> 2:19:26.620\n can we, and then also drug policy reform\n\n2:19:26.620 --> 2:19:28.420\n and embed knowledge in the society,\n\n2:19:28.420 --> 2:19:31.060\n can we get to honest drug education?\n\n2:19:31.060 --> 2:19:36.060\n DARE, the Drug Awareness Resistance Education,\n\n2:19:36.580 --> 2:19:39.140\n is fundamentally twisted.\n\n2:19:39.140 --> 2:19:42.780\n But it's the program that's used in a lot of schools now.\n\n2:19:42.780 --> 2:19:44.620\n So can we get honest drug education,\n\n2:19:44.620 --> 2:19:47.060\n pure drugs, harm reduction,\n\n2:19:47.060 --> 2:19:49.340\n and knowledge about therapeutic uses\n\n2:19:49.340 --> 2:19:51.860\n and on the one hand,\n\n2:19:51.860 --> 2:19:54.420\n and more of these thousands of psychedelic clinics?\n\n2:19:55.420 --> 2:19:59.100\n I'm hopeful and that's our goal.\n\n2:19:59.100 --> 2:20:04.020\n But in this landscape of pharma companies,\n\n2:20:04.020 --> 2:20:05.820\n they make a lot of money.\n\n2:20:05.820 --> 2:20:07.820\n Some people are worried about the impact\n\n2:20:07.820 --> 2:20:10.740\n of those, you know, of big pharma\n\n2:20:10.740 --> 2:20:13.020\n on the landscape of human trauma.\n\n2:20:13.020 --> 2:20:14.100\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:20:14.100 --> 2:20:17.540\n So there's, of course, some companies could do good,\n\n2:20:17.540 --> 2:20:20.100\n but that's not inherent,\n\n2:20:20.100 --> 2:20:24.780\n like many of these companies are not optimizing for good,\n\n2:20:24.780 --> 2:20:26.380\n they're optimizing for profit.\n\n2:20:26.380 --> 2:20:27.460\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n2:20:27.460 --> 2:20:31.860\n Does this rise of for profit pharma companies worry you?\n\n2:20:31.860 --> 2:20:33.660\n How do you navigate it?\n\n2:20:33.660 --> 2:20:35.580\n Do we still have for profit companies\n\n2:20:35.580 --> 2:20:39.460\n that basically do what MAPS does,\n\n2:20:39.460 --> 2:20:41.420\n which is like fight the good fight\n\n2:20:41.420 --> 2:20:42.820\n for the benefit of humanity?\n\n2:20:42.820 --> 2:20:45.420\n Like how do we proceed in this,\n\n2:20:45.420 --> 2:20:49.580\n in landscape where drugs can make a lot of money?\n\n2:20:49.580 --> 2:20:52.100\n Well, I am concerned.\n\n2:20:52.100 --> 2:20:55.660\n Overall, I think the rise of the for profit companies,\n\n2:20:55.660 --> 2:20:58.460\n we have to realize is a sign of success,\n\n2:20:58.460 --> 2:21:03.460\n that we have overcome the regulatory prohibitions,\n\n2:21:04.260 --> 2:21:06.620\n we've overcome a lot of the public attitudes\n\n2:21:06.620 --> 2:21:09.780\n that are against it, we've demonstrated some success.\n\n2:21:09.780 --> 2:21:12.140\n So the rise of the for profit companies\n\n2:21:12.140 --> 2:21:13.940\n are a sign of the progress that we've made.\n\n2:21:13.940 --> 2:21:15.860\n On the other hand, turning things over\n\n2:21:15.860 --> 2:21:17.780\n to profit maximizing companies,\n\n2:21:19.100 --> 2:21:20.980\n the big concern is that they're gonna try\n\n2:21:20.980 --> 2:21:24.900\n to minimize the amount of therapy\n\n2:21:24.900 --> 2:21:26.740\n and make it so the cost is less,\n\n2:21:26.740 --> 2:21:28.940\n so insurance companies are more likely to cover it\n\n2:21:28.940 --> 2:21:31.140\n and then that they just sell the most drugs.\n\n2:21:32.060 --> 2:21:34.500\n The other thing we've seen as an example of this\n\n2:21:34.500 --> 2:21:37.740\n is S ketamine by Johnson and Johnson for depression.\n\n2:21:37.740 --> 2:21:40.700\n And it's done by a profit maximizing company.\n\n2:21:40.700 --> 2:21:43.180\n They don't know anything about psychedelic psychotherapy\n\n2:21:43.180 --> 2:21:44.900\n or psychotherapy at all.\n\n2:21:44.900 --> 2:21:48.460\n And so they've gotten approval for S ketamine\n\n2:21:48.460 --> 2:21:51.980\n on the basis of it's just a pharmacological treatment\n\n2:21:51.980 --> 2:21:54.980\n and it's not delivered with therapy,\n\n2:21:54.980 --> 2:21:57.100\n the results fade pretty quickly,\n\n2:21:57.100 --> 2:21:59.860\n so you need to get more ketamine.\n\n2:21:59.860 --> 2:22:02.820\n And so it's designed in a way to maximize the profits\n\n2:22:02.820 --> 2:22:04.980\n for the pharmaceutical company,\n\n2:22:04.980 --> 2:22:07.780\n but it doesn't maximize patient outcomes.\n\n2:22:07.780 --> 2:22:10.420\n What we're seeing though in these various clinics\n\n2:22:10.420 --> 2:22:14.100\n that are being set up is that a lot of people are realizing\n\n2:22:14.100 --> 2:22:17.620\n that it works better with therapy.\n\n2:22:17.620 --> 2:22:20.660\n And so the clinics are run by people that are therapists\n\n2:22:20.660 --> 2:22:22.980\n so that when they provide therapy,\n\n2:22:22.980 --> 2:22:26.500\n they're making more money and then you need less ketamine.\n\n2:22:26.500 --> 2:22:31.500\n Also ketamine itself, S ketamine is a isomer of ketamine\n\n2:22:31.540 --> 2:22:33.540\n that's been patented for depression\n\n2:22:33.540 --> 2:22:35.020\n and they sell it for hundreds of dollars,\n\n2:22:35.020 --> 2:22:37.140\n but ketamine itself\n\n2:22:37.140 --> 2:22:39.300\n is one of the world's essential medicines.\n\n2:22:39.300 --> 2:22:41.580\n It's off patent, it's been around for a long time,\n\n2:22:41.580 --> 2:22:44.580\n it was the main battlefield anesthetic in Vietnam.\n\n2:22:44.580 --> 2:22:47.380\n And it's only a few bucks because it's generic.\n\n2:22:47.380 --> 2:22:49.740\n So a lot of the ketamine clinics are saying,\n\n2:22:49.740 --> 2:22:51.860\n great, thank you, Johnson and Johnson,\n\n2:22:51.860 --> 2:22:53.940\n you've helped demonstrate that ketamine is good\n\n2:22:53.940 --> 2:22:56.300\n for depression, but we're not gonna buy it from you.\n\n2:22:56.300 --> 2:22:58.060\n We're gonna buy it for a few bucks\n\n2:22:58.060 --> 2:23:00.660\n and we're gonna add therapy to it.\n\n2:23:00.660 --> 2:23:02.700\n Now there's a bunch of ketamine mills you could say\n\n2:23:02.700 --> 2:23:05.180\n that are just prescribing the ketamine\n\n2:23:05.180 --> 2:23:07.140\n and people are making a lot of money there.\n\n2:23:07.140 --> 2:23:09.380\n So I am worried about that.\n\n2:23:09.380 --> 2:23:11.300\n I think the best thing that we can do\n\n2:23:11.300 --> 2:23:15.620\n is create an alternative narrative,\n\n2:23:15.620 --> 2:23:16.940\n a different kind of example.\n\n2:23:16.940 --> 2:23:18.060\n We can lead by example.\n\n2:23:18.060 --> 2:23:20.300\n We can't make for profit companies\n\n2:23:20.300 --> 2:23:23.620\n into benefit corporations unless they wanna do that.\n\n2:23:23.620 --> 2:23:28.420\n We can't make them to really maximize patient outcomes.\n\n2:23:28.420 --> 2:23:32.500\n But if we create an example of something that's different,\n\n2:23:32.500 --> 2:23:36.100\n the hope is that people will gravitate towards that\n\n2:23:36.100 --> 2:23:37.860\n and some of the other companies.\n\n2:23:37.860 --> 2:23:41.220\n Like even now we have Exxon and other these companies,\n\n2:23:41.220 --> 2:23:42.660\n oil companies saying, oh, we're big\n\n2:23:42.660 --> 2:23:45.860\n into alternative energy and we're, you know.\n\n2:23:45.860 --> 2:23:48.860\n And that starts with companies that show an example\n\n2:23:48.860 --> 2:23:51.060\n that then communicates to the public\n\n2:23:51.060 --> 2:23:53.140\n that this is something exciting\n\n2:23:53.140 --> 2:23:56.380\n and then they demand the same of Exxon and so on.\n\n2:23:56.380 --> 2:23:58.780\n The public demands it and you could say the same thing\n\n2:23:58.780 --> 2:24:03.500\n for the public demanding the big pharma\n\n2:24:03.500 --> 2:24:08.340\n to optimize for benefit versus optimize for profit\n\n2:24:08.340 --> 2:24:11.060\n and maybe giving power to the therapists,\n\n2:24:11.060 --> 2:24:13.540\n more power to the therapists, more power to the doctors\n\n2:24:13.540 --> 2:24:16.420\n that ultimately want.\n\n2:24:16.420 --> 2:24:21.020\n I think incentives are interesting,\n\n2:24:21.020 --> 2:24:25.220\n but I think doctors ultimately care more\n\n2:24:25.220 --> 2:24:27.380\n because they're in direct contact with humans.\n\n2:24:27.380 --> 2:24:29.020\n They want to make people better.\n\n2:24:29.020 --> 2:24:31.340\n It's not, you know, sure they wanna make money,\n\n2:24:31.340 --> 2:24:33.860\n but they ultimately want to make people feel better\n\n2:24:33.860 --> 2:24:35.420\n because they get to look at people\n\n2:24:35.420 --> 2:24:38.460\n and it's so joyful to make people feel better\n\n2:24:38.460 --> 2:24:39.300\n at the end of the day.\n\n2:24:39.300 --> 2:24:43.060\n So giving more power to them is also perhaps\n\n2:24:43.060 --> 2:24:45.940\n one of the ways that you then incentivize\n\n2:24:46.940 --> 2:24:51.660\n the pharma companies that are trying to do good\n\n2:24:51.660 --> 2:24:53.820\n because the doctors will choose those companies.\n\n2:24:53.820 --> 2:24:57.300\n Yeah, now the other part of this is drug policy reform.\n\n2:24:57.300 --> 2:25:00.020\n So that if we make it so that you can buy MDMA\n\n2:25:00.020 --> 2:25:03.140\n for 10 or 20 bucks on your own\n\n2:25:03.140 --> 2:25:06.500\n and we've trained people on here's our therapeutic method,\n\n2:25:06.500 --> 2:25:09.440\n here is our ways for peer support,\n\n2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:13.380\n then people have an alternative from buying it\n\n2:25:13.380 --> 2:25:15.020\n from the pharma companies.\n\n2:25:15.020 --> 2:25:18.340\n So most of the for profit companies\n\n2:25:18.340 --> 2:25:20.300\n have come to this conclusion\n\n2:25:20.300 --> 2:25:24.760\n that drug policy reform is bad for their business model.\n\n2:25:25.580 --> 2:25:28.300\n I think they're making a fundamental mistake.\n\n2:25:28.300 --> 2:25:30.380\n And I think the reason is that\n\n2:25:30.380 --> 2:25:32.300\n the more that we de stigmatize this,\n\n2:25:32.300 --> 2:25:35.720\n the more that we sensitize people to this is an approach,\n\n2:25:35.720 --> 2:25:37.860\n even when people can get it on their own\n\n2:25:37.860 --> 2:25:40.700\n and do it with their friends or do it with themselves,\n\n2:25:40.700 --> 2:25:42.720\n there's gonna be even more people that say,\n\n2:25:42.720 --> 2:25:44.860\n oh my God, I've got real serious issues.\n\n2:25:44.860 --> 2:25:47.780\n I would rather go to trained professionals\n\n2:25:47.780 --> 2:25:49.720\n covered by insurance.\n\n2:25:49.720 --> 2:25:52.580\n And I think it'll increase the business,\n\n2:25:52.580 --> 2:25:56.140\n but most of the for profit companies don't see it that way.\n\n2:25:56.140 --> 2:26:00.780\n And so as a nonprofit that owns a benefit corp,\n\n2:26:00.780 --> 2:26:03.700\n we're not trying to maximize sales or profits.\n\n2:26:03.700 --> 2:26:06.740\n But I do believe that drug policy reform\n\n2:26:06.740 --> 2:26:10.180\n creates this alternative access point for people\n\n2:26:10.180 --> 2:26:12.800\n and that will help keep the for profits in check\n\n2:26:12.800 --> 2:26:15.820\n to some extent as well.\n\n2:26:15.820 --> 2:26:16.660\n I love it.\n\n2:26:18.580 --> 2:26:22.460\n Let's put on your wise visionary hat\n\n2:26:22.460 --> 2:26:25.980\n and ask when you look to young folks,\n\n2:26:25.980 --> 2:26:28.900\n is there advice you can give to young people today,\n\n2:26:28.900 --> 2:26:33.900\n whether in high school or college about career, about life?\n\n2:26:33.900 --> 2:26:36.820\n You've lived quite a nonlinear\n\n2:26:36.820 --> 2:26:39.020\n and fascinating life yourself.\n\n2:26:39.020 --> 2:26:40.220\n Is there advice you can give\n\n2:26:40.220 --> 2:26:42.680\n either on career or more generally on life?\n\n2:26:43.820 --> 2:26:48.720\n Well, I would say what people often hear is that,\n\n2:26:51.580 --> 2:26:54.420\n we're not actually here for that long a period of time.\n\n2:26:55.960 --> 2:26:59.700\n And the world is on fire.\n\n2:26:59.700 --> 2:27:03.020\n And whether humanity survives is not clear.\n\n2:27:03.020 --> 2:27:05.740\n And how many species are we gonna kill\n\n2:27:05.740 --> 2:27:08.440\n before we figure out not to do that anymore?\n\n2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:12.780\n So I would advise you to really try to\n\n2:27:15.060 --> 2:27:17.760\n develop a combination of what do you need\n\n2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:20.400\n in terms of income for your own survival,\n\n2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:22.820\n but what does the world need in terms of\n\n2:27:25.680 --> 2:27:27.580\n help to make the world better?\n\n2:27:27.580 --> 2:27:30.880\n And Howard Thurman, who we talked about,\n\n2:27:30.880 --> 2:27:33.740\n who ran the Good Friday experiment, the minister there,\n\n2:27:33.740 --> 2:27:36.300\n he said, he's got a famous quote attributed to him.\n\n2:27:36.300 --> 2:27:40.180\n He says, and this is exactly it to young people.\n\n2:27:40.180 --> 2:27:43.900\n He said, there's nothing particular that you should do,\n\n2:27:43.900 --> 2:27:46.300\n but find what makes you come alive\n\n2:27:46.300 --> 2:27:48.180\n because what the world needs is people\n\n2:27:48.180 --> 2:27:50.760\n that have come alive and are passionate.\n\n2:27:52.300 --> 2:27:57.300\n So I would say that be aware of this trap\n\n2:27:57.300 --> 2:28:02.300\n that you need vast resources, that you need all this stuff.\n\n2:28:03.900 --> 2:28:07.460\n I keep thinking of the super wealthy people\n\n2:28:07.460 --> 2:28:09.980\n in first class on the Titanic,\n\n2:28:09.980 --> 2:28:12.100\n as the Titanic is sinking.\n\n2:28:12.100 --> 2:28:13.940\n Their money's not gonna help them.\n\n2:28:13.940 --> 2:28:15.980\n The Earth is like Titanic.\n\n2:28:15.980 --> 2:28:18.100\n We're sinking, we're destroying the planets,\n\n2:28:18.100 --> 2:28:18.940\n destroying the environment.\n\n2:28:18.940 --> 2:28:23.940\n So you need a certain amount of money to be comfortable\n\n2:28:23.940 --> 2:28:25.740\n to be able to do that.\n\n2:28:25.740 --> 2:28:28.260\n You need to be comfortable to not be\n\n2:28:28.260 --> 2:28:29.440\n at that edge of survival,\n\n2:28:29.440 --> 2:28:31.060\n because once you're at that edge of survival,\n\n2:28:31.060 --> 2:28:32.420\n it's hard to think about anything else.\n\n2:28:32.420 --> 2:28:34.240\n But I'd say to young people,\n\n2:28:36.940 --> 2:28:39.040\n to the extent that you're able to do this,\n\n2:28:39.040 --> 2:28:41.300\n and again, student debt and all this kind of stuff\n\n2:28:41.300 --> 2:28:42.740\n is a big problem there too,\n\n2:28:42.740 --> 2:28:47.740\n but really just try to find this combination\n\n2:28:48.540 --> 2:28:50.220\n of what the world needs and what you need.\n\n2:28:50.220 --> 2:28:52.660\n The other thing to say to young people is\n\n2:28:52.660 --> 2:28:55.740\n that life is a lot shorter than you think,\n\n2:28:57.600 --> 2:29:00.400\n and a 20 year plan is not really that long.\n\n2:29:00.400 --> 2:29:03.120\n So if it takes you 20 years to get in a position\n\n2:29:03.120 --> 2:29:07.280\n to do what you wanna do, go for it.\n\n2:29:07.280 --> 2:29:08.820\n Have longterm plans.\n\n2:29:08.820 --> 2:29:11.400\n The other part that was so important for me\n\n2:29:11.400 --> 2:29:14.360\n to keep doing what I've been doing,\n\n2:29:14.360 --> 2:29:17.320\n basically now it's 49 years\n\n2:29:17.320 --> 2:29:18.880\n that I've sort of been devoting my life\n\n2:29:18.880 --> 2:29:20.440\n on psychedelics since I was 18.\n\n2:29:20.440 --> 2:29:23.620\n But when I started, I didn't think it would ever work.\n\n2:29:23.620 --> 2:29:25.500\n I just thought this is the only idea I have\n\n2:29:25.500 --> 2:29:29.220\n in this crazy world, this is what I wanna work on.\n\n2:29:29.220 --> 2:29:30.980\n Luckily, I had support from my family\n\n2:29:30.980 --> 2:29:34.660\n that took care of my survival needs, so I could do that.\n\n2:29:34.660 --> 2:29:37.860\n But I realized that if my happiness\n\n2:29:37.860 --> 2:29:40.940\n was dependent upon accomplishments,\n\n2:29:40.940 --> 2:29:42.760\n that I might never be happy,\n\n2:29:42.760 --> 2:29:47.760\n that I was able to reframe happiness in terms of effort.\n\n2:29:47.760 --> 2:29:52.760\n So if I'm trying hard to get stuff to be better,\n\n2:29:54.120 --> 2:29:55.480\n whether it's better or not,\n\n2:29:55.480 --> 2:29:58.640\n I can be happy at the end of each day, I tried.\n\n2:29:58.640 --> 2:30:01.600\n And so I think you try to separate out\n\n2:30:01.600 --> 2:30:03.720\n the goals that you have and your happiness\n\n2:30:03.720 --> 2:30:05.380\n to whether you're trying hard.\n\n2:30:06.520 --> 2:30:08.080\n The other thing I would say\n\n2:30:08.080 --> 2:30:13.000\n is that everybody has this humanity within them.\n\n2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:14.940\n So be very careful about dividing the world\n\n2:30:14.940 --> 2:30:19.940\n into us and them, and try to...\n\n2:30:20.880 --> 2:30:23.600\n So one of the things that I've done\n\n2:30:23.600 --> 2:30:27.760\n that has taken a long time,\n\n2:30:27.760 --> 2:30:31.040\n because I feel like drugs are illegal.\n\n2:30:31.040 --> 2:30:33.540\n I always felt like the police were the predator\n\n2:30:33.540 --> 2:30:35.040\n and I'm the prey.\n\n2:30:35.040 --> 2:30:36.480\n Yes.\n\n2:30:36.480 --> 2:30:38.100\n But now we're working with the police,\n\n2:30:38.100 --> 2:30:39.980\n and the police have tremendous trauma\n\n2:30:39.980 --> 2:30:41.080\n from the work that they do.\n\n2:30:41.080 --> 2:30:43.400\n We have one police officer who is now going,\n\n2:30:43.400 --> 2:30:45.240\n he's a full time police officer,\n\n2:30:45.240 --> 2:30:47.880\n he's also a psychotherapist.\n\n2:30:47.880 --> 2:30:50.120\n And he's going through our training program\n\n2:30:50.120 --> 2:30:53.880\n to learn how to give MDMA therapy to other police officers.\n\n2:30:53.880 --> 2:30:56.680\n And I met his police chief a couple of times,\n\n2:30:56.680 --> 2:30:58.760\n he got permission from his police chief\n\n2:30:58.760 --> 2:31:01.080\n to go to the second part of our training program,\n\n2:31:01.080 --> 2:31:03.720\n which is where we give MDMA to therapists\n\n2:31:03.720 --> 2:31:06.320\n who volunteer as a patient.\n\n2:31:06.320 --> 2:31:08.360\n So we have just a couple of weeks ago,\n\n2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:11.360\n dosed the police with MDMA.\n\n2:31:11.360 --> 2:31:13.760\n And so I think this idea of those people\n\n2:31:13.760 --> 2:31:16.080\n that are on the quote, other side,\n\n2:31:16.080 --> 2:31:19.760\n try to see through that to their humanity,\n\n2:31:19.760 --> 2:31:21.320\n to what their pains and suffering,\n\n2:31:21.320 --> 2:31:24.920\n what their struggles are, to the extent that you can.\n\n2:31:24.920 --> 2:31:28.480\n And that I think, and build long term relationships.\n\n2:31:28.480 --> 2:31:32.640\n You never know what's gonna come around 20 years from now.\n\n2:31:32.640 --> 2:31:35.320\n So you help some people try to keep these relationships\n\n2:31:35.320 --> 2:31:38.160\n going 20 years from now, something could come.\n\n2:31:38.160 --> 2:31:43.160\n And also be persistent.\n\n2:31:47.600 --> 2:31:49.960\n I think that's been the key to success.\n\n2:31:49.960 --> 2:31:52.720\n I mean, once the FDA or DEA figured out\n\n2:31:52.720 --> 2:31:53.800\n we're not going anywhere,\n\n2:31:53.800 --> 2:31:55.760\n they're gonna have to deal with us,\n\n2:31:55.760 --> 2:31:57.840\n then we started getting some progress.\n\n2:31:57.840 --> 2:32:00.520\n So a mix of patience and stubbornness\n\n2:32:00.520 --> 2:32:02.320\n that gets things done.\n\n2:32:02.320 --> 2:32:05.440\n Is there something you've figured out\n\n2:32:05.440 --> 2:32:08.400\n through your journey with psychedelics\n\n2:32:08.400 --> 2:32:11.920\n about some of the big why questions about life?\n\n2:32:11.920 --> 2:32:15.800\n Like, what the heck's the value of love?\n\n2:32:18.200 --> 2:32:20.760\n Why does it suck so much that we die?\n\n2:32:21.720 --> 2:32:25.440\n And for some of us, maybe it's the Russian in me,\n\n2:32:25.440 --> 2:32:28.080\n but it's quite terrifying, the notion of it.\n\n2:32:28.080 --> 2:32:30.080\n Or the biggest why question of them all,\n\n2:32:30.080 --> 2:32:33.040\n which is what's the meaning of it all?\n\n2:32:33.040 --> 2:32:35.640\n Well, yeah, what I've discovered is\n\n2:32:35.640 --> 2:32:39.440\n that we don't need answers to those questions.\n\n2:32:40.560 --> 2:32:45.560\n That the fact that we can feel happy,\n\n2:32:46.400 --> 2:32:50.160\n that we can love, that we can have moments of happiness,\n\n2:32:50.160 --> 2:32:51.000\n that's enough.\n\n2:32:52.640 --> 2:32:56.160\n Figuring out these big questions, you can get lost in that.\n\n2:32:56.160 --> 2:32:58.840\n And we all can come up with our answers.\n\n2:32:58.840 --> 2:33:00.600\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n2:33:00.600 --> 2:33:01.880\n Why is there life?\n\n2:33:01.880 --> 2:33:02.920\n Why is there consciousness?\n\n2:33:02.920 --> 2:33:06.000\n But I don't know that we need those answers.\n\n2:33:06.000 --> 2:33:10.120\n What we know is that we're social creatures,\n\n2:33:10.120 --> 2:33:14.720\n that other people can make us happy by certain things,\n\n2:33:14.720 --> 2:33:17.800\n we can make other people happy, that one life is enough.\n\n2:33:17.800 --> 2:33:22.800\n So this other part about why is it so tragic that we die?\n\n2:33:23.160 --> 2:33:25.320\n I don't think it's tragic that we die.\n\n2:33:25.320 --> 2:33:27.800\n So first off, if you believe in this collective unconscious,\n\n2:33:27.800 --> 2:33:32.480\n but we have an impact that lasts.\n\n2:33:32.480 --> 2:33:35.160\n But I think that for me at least,\n\n2:33:35.160 --> 2:33:40.160\n I've been of the view that we should be grateful for death,\n\n2:33:40.520 --> 2:33:42.600\n that death makes life precious,\n\n2:33:42.600 --> 2:33:45.200\n that if we had an infinite amount of time,\n\n2:33:46.120 --> 2:33:49.200\n I mean, I'm a bit of a procrastinator about stuff,\n\n2:33:49.200 --> 2:33:52.280\n particularly things that are really hard to do\n\n2:33:52.280 --> 2:33:54.200\n and you just don't do it.\n\n2:33:54.200 --> 2:33:55.400\n And then like, where'd the day go?\n\n2:33:55.400 --> 2:33:56.240\n I was gonna do this.\n\n2:33:56.240 --> 2:33:59.320\n So if we had infinite life, we never died,\n\n2:33:59.320 --> 2:34:03.440\n and would life be precious?\n\n2:34:03.440 --> 2:34:04.400\n Would we do anything?\n\n2:34:04.400 --> 2:34:05.280\n I don't think so.\n\n2:34:05.280 --> 2:34:10.280\n So my parents gave every Jewish new year,\n\n2:34:11.160 --> 2:34:14.000\n they would make their new year's card.\n\n2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:16.360\n And one of the quotes was fantastic.\n\n2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:20.320\n It was just, we have to make up for the brevity of life\n\n2:34:20.320 --> 2:34:22.480\n with the intensity of life.\n\n2:34:22.480 --> 2:34:24.520\n Oh man, that is good.\n\n2:34:24.520 --> 2:34:29.080\n Well, the end makes things precious.\n\n2:34:29.080 --> 2:34:30.600\n Death makes life precious.\n\n2:34:30.600 --> 2:34:34.480\n The end of this conversation makes it precious,\n\n2:34:34.480 --> 2:34:38.200\n and which is a great way to end, Rick.\n\n2:34:38.200 --> 2:34:40.760\n I wanted to talk to you for a long time.\n\n2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:43.280\n I share, you were very excited about the study.\n\n2:34:43.280 --> 2:34:46.920\n I can now understand exactly why this is really promising.\n\n2:34:46.920 --> 2:34:50.240\n This is really exciting, gives me hope about the future,\n\n2:34:50.240 --> 2:34:53.720\n even if it doesn't come fast enough.\n\n2:34:53.720 --> 2:34:56.560\n But like you said, I have to be patient and stubborn.\n\n2:34:56.560 --> 2:34:58.360\n Thank you so much for wasting\n\n2:34:58.360 --> 2:34:59.960\n all your valuable time with me today.\n\n2:34:59.960 --> 2:35:01.760\n It's truly an honor to meet you and talk to you.\n\n2:35:01.760 --> 2:35:02.840\n Not a waste at all.\n\n2:35:02.840 --> 2:35:05.760\n I really appreciated this time together.\n\n2:35:06.840 --> 2:35:08.400\n Thank you for listening to this conversation\n\n2:35:08.400 --> 2:35:12.480\n with Rick Doblin, and thank you to Theragun, ExpressVPN,\n\n2:35:12.480 --> 2:35:14.640\n Blinkist, and Asleep.\n\n2:35:14.640 --> 2:35:17.920\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n2:35:17.920 --> 2:35:19.640\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n2:35:19.640 --> 2:35:21.520\n from Terrence McKenna.\n\n2:35:21.520 --> 2:35:23.120\n Nature loves courage.\n\n2:35:23.120 --> 2:35:25.760\n You make the commitment, and nature will respond\n\n2:35:25.760 --> 2:35:29.280\n to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles.\n\n2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:30.840\n Dream the impossible dream,\n\n2:35:30.840 --> 2:35:33.160\n and the world will not grind you under.\n\n2:35:33.160 --> 2:35:34.680\n It will lift you up.\n\n2:35:34.680 --> 2:35:36.040\n This is the trick.\n\n2:35:36.040 --> 2:35:38.680\n This is what all the teachers and philosophers\n\n2:35:38.680 --> 2:35:42.880\n who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold,\n\n2:35:42.880 --> 2:35:44.640\n this is what they understood.\n\n2:35:44.640 --> 2:35:47.480\n This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall.\n\n2:35:47.480 --> 2:35:49.320\n This is how magic is done,\n\n2:35:49.320 --> 2:35:51.440\n by hurling yourself into the abyss\n\n2:35:51.440 --> 2:35:54.600\n and discovering that it's a feather bed.\n\n2:35:54.600 --> 2:36:21.600\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
