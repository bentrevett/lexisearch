00:07.720\n and widely considered to be one of,\n\n00:07.720 --> 00:10.320\n if not the greatest chess player of all time.\n\n00:11.200 --> 00:14.480\n The camera on Magnus died 20 minutes into the conversation.\n\n00:14.480 --> 00:16.920\n Most folks still just listen to the audio\n\n00:16.920 --> 00:18.760\n through a podcast player anyway,\n\n00:18.760 --> 00:23.120\n but if you're watching this on YouTube or Spotify,\n\n00:23.120 --> 00:25.040\n we did our best to still make it interesting\n\n00:25.040 --> 00:27.040\n by adding relevant image overlays.\n\n00:27.040 --> 00:32.040\n I mess things up sometimes, like in this case,\n\n00:32.160 --> 00:34.520\n but I'm always working hard to improve.\n\n00:34.520 --> 00:35.880\n I hope you understand.\n\n00:36.720 --> 00:39.880\n Thank you for your patience and support along the way.\n\n00:39.880 --> 00:40.800\n I love you all.\n\n00:42.040 --> 00:44.040\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.\n\n00:44.040 --> 00:46.120\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:46.120 --> 00:47.400\n in the description.\n\n00:47.400 --> 00:50.900\n And now, dear friends, here's Magnus Carlsen.\n\n00:51.920 --> 00:54.680\n You're considered by many to be one of the greatest,\n\n00:54.680 --> 00:57.160\n if not the greatest chess players of all time,\n\n00:57.160 --> 00:59.320\n but you're also one of the best fantasy football,\n\n00:59.320 --> 01:02.200\n AKA soccer, competitors in the world,\n\n01:02.200 --> 01:03.580\n plus recently picking up poker\n\n01:03.580 --> 01:06.280\n and competing at a world class level.\n\n01:06.280 --> 01:09.820\n So before chess, let's talk football and greatness.\n\n01:10.740 --> 01:12.880\n You're a Real Madrid fan,\n\n01:12.880 --> 01:15.000\n so let me ask you the ridiculous big question.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:17.480\n Who do you think is the greatest football,\n\n01:17.480 --> 01:19.720\n AKA soccer player of all time?\n\n01:19.720 --> 01:22.240\n Can you make the case for Messi?\n\n01:22.240 --> 01:25.920\n Can you make the case for Cristiano Ronaldo, Pele,\n\n01:25.920 --> 01:28.840\n Maradona, does anybody jump to mind?\n\n01:28.840 --> 01:30.800\n I think it's pretty hard to make a case\n\n01:30.800 --> 01:35.800\n for anybody else than Messi for his all around game.\n\n01:37.460 --> 01:42.220\n And frankly, my Real Madrid fandom\n\n01:42.220 --> 01:47.220\n sort of predates the Ronaldo era,\n\n01:47.840 --> 01:50.380\n the second Ronaldo, not the first one.\n\n01:50.380 --> 01:51.880\n So I always liked Ronaldo,\n\n01:51.880 --> 01:56.640\n but I always kind of thought that Messi was better.\n\n01:56.640 --> 02:00.200\n And I went to quite a number of Madrid games\n\n02:00.200 --> 02:03.760\n and they've always been super helpful to me down there.\n\n02:03.760 --> 02:06.820\n The only thing is that, like they asked me,\n\n02:06.820 --> 02:08.600\n they were gonna do an interview\n\n02:08.600 --> 02:10.980\n and they were gonna ask me who my favorite player was.\n\n02:10.980 --> 02:14.320\n And I said somebody else,\n\n02:14.320 --> 02:15.920\n I think I said Isco at that point,\n\n02:15.920 --> 02:19.480\n and I was like, okay, take two now you say Ronaldo.\n\n02:19.480 --> 02:22.600\n So for them it was very important,\n\n02:22.600 --> 02:26.520\n but it wasn't that huge to me.\n\n02:26.520 --> 02:29.080\n So Messi over Maradona.\n\n02:29.080 --> 02:32.480\n Yeah, but I think just like with chess,\n\n02:32.480 --> 02:34.640\n it's hard to compare eras.\n\n02:34.640 --> 02:36.480\n Obviously the improvements in football\n\n02:36.480 --> 02:39.600\n have been like in technique and such\n\n02:39.600 --> 02:43.240\n have been even greater than they have been in chess,\n\n02:43.240 --> 02:48.240\n but it's always a weird discussion to have.\n\n02:48.240 --> 02:50.320\n But just as a fan,\n\n02:50.320 --> 02:54.400\n what do you think is beautiful about the game?\n\n02:54.400 --> 02:55.760\n What defines greatness?\n\n02:55.760 --> 02:58.160\n Is it, you know, with Messi,\n\n02:58.160 --> 03:00.080\n one, he's really good at finishing,\n\n03:00.080 --> 03:02.280\n two, very good at assist,\n\n03:02.280 --> 03:03.640\n like three, there's just magic.\n\n03:03.640 --> 03:05.480\n It's just beautiful to see the play.\n\n03:05.480 --> 03:06.960\n So it's not just about the finishing.\n\n03:06.960 --> 03:09.800\n There's some, it's like Maradona's hand of God.\n\n03:09.800 --> 03:13.240\n There's some creativity on the pitch.\n\n03:13.240 --> 03:15.840\n Is that important or is it very important\n\n03:15.840 --> 03:18.200\n to get the World Cups and the big championships\n\n03:18.200 --> 03:19.240\n and that kind of stuff?\n\n03:19.240 --> 03:22.080\n I think the World Cup is pretty overrated,\n\n03:22.080 --> 03:26.600\n seeing as it's such a small sample size.\n\n03:26.600 --> 03:31.400\n So it sort of annoys me always when, you know,\n\n03:31.400 --> 03:35.960\n titles are always appreciated so much,\n\n03:35.960 --> 03:40.960\n even though that particular title can be a lot of luck\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:45.160\n or at least some luck.\n\n03:45.160 --> 03:50.160\n So I do appreciate the statistics a bit\n\n03:50.840 --> 03:54.000\n and all the statistics say that Messi's\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:55.840\n the best finisher of all time,\n\n03:55.840 --> 03:58.440\n which I think helps a lot.\n\n03:58.440 --> 04:01.400\n And then there's the intangibles as well.\n\n04:01.400 --> 04:04.120\n The flip side of that is the small sample size\n\n04:05.080 --> 04:10.080\n is what really creates the magic.\n\n04:10.120 --> 04:12.680\n It's so, it's just like the Olympics.\n\n04:12.680 --> 04:15.240\n You basically train your whole life for this.\n\n04:15.240 --> 04:17.520\n You live your whole life for this and it's a rare moment.\n\n04:17.520 --> 04:20.600\n One mistake and it's all over.\n\n04:20.600 --> 04:23.920\n That's, for some reason, a lot of people\n\n04:23.920 --> 04:25.440\n either break under that pressure\n\n04:25.440 --> 04:26.920\n or rise up under that pressure.\n\n04:26.920 --> 04:28.800\n You don't admire the magic of that?\n\n04:28.800 --> 04:29.920\n No, I do.\n\n04:29.920 --> 04:34.000\n I just think that rising under pressure\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:36.200\n and breaking under the pressure\n\n04:36.200 --> 04:41.200\n is often a really oversimplified take\n\n04:41.200 --> 04:44.440\n on what's happening.\n\n04:44.440 --> 04:46.800\n Yeah, we do romanticize the game.\n\n04:46.800 --> 04:48.880\n Well, let me ask you another ridiculous question.\n\n04:48.880 --> 04:50.840\n You're also a fan of basketball.\n\n04:50.840 --> 04:51.680\n Yes.\n\n04:53.160 --> 04:54.680\n Let me ask the goat question.\n\n04:55.720 --> 04:58.960\n I'm biased because I went to high school in Chicago,\n\n05:00.040 --> 05:02.400\n Chicago Bulls during the Michael Jordan era.\n\n05:03.400 --> 05:07.360\n Let me ask the Jordan versus LeBron James question.\n\n05:07.360 --> 05:10.240\n Let's continue on this thread of greatness.\n\n05:10.240 --> 05:12.400\n Which one do you pick or somebody else?\n\n05:13.240 --> 05:14.080\n Magic Johnson.\n\n05:14.080 --> 05:15.760\n So I'll give you a completely different answer.\n\n05:15.760 --> 05:16.600\n Uh oh.\n\n05:17.640 --> 05:21.400\n Depending on my mood and depending on whom I talk to,\n\n05:21.400 --> 05:24.600\n I pick one of the two and then I try to argue for that.\n\n05:24.600 --> 05:25.680\n With the quantum mechanical thing.\n\n05:25.680 --> 05:30.560\n Well, can you, what, again, what would,\n\n05:30.560 --> 05:32.640\n if you were to argue for either one,\n\n05:35.240 --> 05:36.920\n statistically, I think LeBron James\n\n05:36.920 --> 05:38.680\n is going to surpass Jordan.\n\n05:38.680 --> 05:39.840\n Yeah, no doubt.\n\n05:39.840 --> 05:44.840\n And so again, there's a debate between.\n\n05:44.920 --> 05:46.840\n Unquantifiable greatness, no?\n\n05:46.840 --> 05:50.160\n I mean, that's the whole, that's the whole debate.\n\n05:50.160 --> 05:51.000\n Yes.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:54.000\n So it's, well, it's quantifiable versus unquantifiable.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:54.840\n Yeah.\n\n05:54.840 --> 05:55.680\n What's more important?\n\n05:55.680 --> 05:58.240\n And you're depending on mood all over the place.\n\n05:58.240 --> 05:59.560\n Yeah.\n\n05:59.560 --> 06:02.520\n But what do you lean in general with these folks,\n\n06:02.520 --> 06:04.800\n with soccer, with anything in life,\n\n06:05.720 --> 06:07.800\n towards the unquantifiable more?\n\n06:07.800 --> 06:10.640\n No, definitely towards the quantifiable.\n\n06:10.640 --> 06:12.600\n So when you're unsure, lean towards the numbers.\n\n06:12.600 --> 06:13.440\n Yeah.\n\n06:13.440 --> 06:15.800\n But see, like, it's later generations.\n\n06:15.800 --> 06:18.000\n There's something, that's what people say about Maradona\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:23.000\n is, you know, he took a arguably somewhat mediocre team\n\n06:23.600 --> 06:25.320\n to a World Cup.\n\n06:25.320 --> 06:28.760\n So there's that also uplifting nature of the player\n\n06:28.760 --> 06:31.200\n to be able to rise up, it is a team sport.\n\n06:31.200 --> 06:36.080\n So are you gonna, like, are you gonna punish Messi\n\n06:36.080 --> 06:40.000\n for taking a mediocre Argentine squad\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:43.480\n to the final in 2014 and punish him\n\n06:43.480 --> 06:47.560\n because they lost to a great team very narrowly\n\n06:47.560 --> 06:49.280\n after they missed?\n\n06:49.280 --> 06:50.600\n The internet does.\n\n06:50.600 --> 06:53.320\n He set up, like, a great chance for Higuain\n\n06:53.320 --> 06:57.560\n in the first half, which he, which he fluffed.\n\n06:57.560 --> 07:00.160\n And then, yeah, eventually they lost the game.\n\n07:00.160 --> 07:02.520\n Yeah, they do criticize Cristiano Ronaldo,\n\n07:02.520 --> 07:04.920\n Messi for being on really strong squads\n\n07:04.920 --> 07:07.880\n in terms of the club teams and saying,\n\n07:07.880 --> 07:10.880\n yeah, okay, it's easy when you have like Ronaldinho\n\n07:10.880 --> 07:13.400\n or whoever on your team.\n\n07:13.400 --> 07:14.880\n It would be very interesting\n\n07:14.880 --> 07:18.680\n just if the league could make a decision.\n\n07:19.520 --> 07:21.760\n Yeah, just random, random allocation.\n\n07:21.760 --> 07:22.600\n Yeah.\n\n07:25.720 --> 07:28.360\n And just every single game, just keep reallocating\n\n07:28.360 --> 07:32.360\n or maybe once a season or every season you get random.\n\n07:32.360 --> 07:36.160\n But let's say every, every player,\n\n07:37.880 --> 07:41.640\n if let's say they sign a five year contract for a team,\n\n07:41.640 --> 07:43.920\n like one of them, you're gonna get randomly allocated\n\n07:43.920 --> 07:46.920\n to, to let's say a bottom half team.\n\n07:48.400 --> 07:50.760\n I bet you there's gonna be so much corruption around that.\n\n07:50.760 --> 07:51.600\n It could be random.\n\n07:51.600 --> 07:54.960\n Obviously it wouldn't, wouldn't ever happen or work,\n\n07:54.960 --> 07:57.680\n but I think it's interesting to think about.\n\n07:57.680 --> 08:01.520\n So on chess, let's zoom out.\n\n08:01.520 --> 08:03.480\n If you break down your approach to chess\n\n08:04.480 --> 08:06.920\n when you're at your best,\n\n08:06.920 --> 08:09.080\n what do you think,\n\n08:10.920 --> 08:12.480\n what do you think contributes to that approach?\n\n08:12.480 --> 08:15.280\n Is it memory recall, specific lines and positions?\n\n08:15.280 --> 08:16.560\n Is it intuition?\n\n08:16.560 --> 08:18.160\n How much of it is intuition?\n\n08:18.160 --> 08:20.280\n How much of it is pure calculation?\n\n08:20.280 --> 08:23.360\n How much of it is messing with the strategy of the opponent?\n\n08:23.360 --> 08:27.000\n So the game theory aspect in terms of what contributes\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.800\n to the highest level of play that you do.\n\n08:30.800 --> 08:35.680\n I think the answer differs a little bit now\n\n08:35.680 --> 08:39.200\n from what it did eight years ago.\n\n08:39.200 --> 08:42.400\n For instance, like I've, I feel like I've had like two peaks\n\n08:42.400 --> 08:45.520\n and in my career in 2014,\n\n08:46.520 --> 08:50.600\n well, 2013, 2014, and also in 2019.\n\n08:50.600 --> 08:54.560\n And in those years, I was very different\n\n08:56.400 --> 09:00.160\n in terms of, of my strength,\n\n09:00.160 --> 09:03.040\n strength as specifically in 2019,\n\n09:03.040 --> 09:06.480\n I benefited a lot from opening preparation\n\n09:07.680 --> 09:09.880\n while in 2013, 2014,\n\n09:09.880 --> 09:14.880\n I mostly tried to avoid my opponent's preparation\n\n09:15.040 --> 09:19.120\n rather than that being a, being a strength.\n\n09:19.120 --> 09:22.600\n So I'm mentioning that also because it's something,\n\n09:22.600 --> 09:26.360\n something you didn't, didn't mention.\n\n09:26.360 --> 09:31.080\n I think like my intuitive understanding of chess has\n\n09:31.080 --> 09:35.720\n over those years always been a little bit better\n\n09:35.720 --> 09:40.040\n than the others, even though it has evolved as well.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:44.400\n Certainly there are, there are things that I understand now\n\n09:44.400 --> 09:46.840\n that I didn't understand back then,\n\n09:46.840 --> 09:51.080\n but that's not only for me, that's for, for others as well.\n\n09:52.040 --> 09:53.160\n I was younger back then.\n\n09:53.160 --> 09:55.040\n So I played with more energy,\n\n09:55.040 --> 09:56.600\n which meant that I could play better\n\n09:56.600 --> 10:00.200\n in long drawn out games,\n\n10:01.760 --> 10:03.800\n which was also a necessity for me\n\n10:03.800 --> 10:05.400\n because I didn't, I couldn't,\n\n10:05.400 --> 10:09.240\n couldn't beat people in the, in the openings.\n\n10:09.240 --> 10:12.480\n But in terms of calculation,\n\n10:12.480 --> 10:16.200\n that's always been a weird issue for me.\n\n10:16.200 --> 10:20.120\n Like I've always been really, really bad\n\n10:20.120 --> 10:22.360\n at solving exercises in chess.\n\n10:22.360 --> 10:27.360\n Like that's been like a blind spot for me.\n\n10:28.680 --> 10:33.000\n First of all, I found it hard to concentrate on them\n\n10:34.440 --> 10:38.840\n and to look, to look deep enough.\n\n10:38.840 --> 10:42.480\n So this is like a puzzle, a position, mate in X.\n\n10:42.480 --> 10:45.520\n I mean, one thing is mate, but find the best move.\n\n10:45.520 --> 10:46.920\n That's generally the exercise,\n\n10:46.920 --> 10:49.800\n like find the best move, find the best line.\n\n10:49.800 --> 10:52.000\n You, you just don't connect with it.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.920\n Usually like you have to, to look, look deep.\n\n10:54.920 --> 10:58.480\n And then when I get these lines during the game,\n\n10:58.480 --> 11:03.480\n I very often find the, the, the right solution,\n\n11:04.160 --> 11:09.160\n even though, even though it's not still\n\n11:11.880 --> 11:16.880\n the best part of my game to, to calculate very, very deeply.\n\n11:17.120 --> 11:19.920\n But it doesn't feel like calculation you're saying\n\n11:19.920 --> 11:20.760\n in terms of.\n\n11:20.760 --> 11:23.840\n And it does sometimes, but for me,\n\n11:23.840 --> 11:26.240\n it's more like I'm at the board trying to find,\n\n11:26.240 --> 11:27.480\n trying to find the solution.\n\n11:27.480 --> 11:30.200\n And I understand like the training at home\n\n11:30.200 --> 11:33.240\n is like trying a little bit to, to replicate that.\n\n11:33.240 --> 11:37.280\n Like you give somebody half an hour in a position,\n\n11:37.280 --> 11:40.320\n like in this instance, you might've thought\n\n11:40.320 --> 11:42.400\n for half an hour if you play the game,\n\n11:42.400 --> 11:44.960\n but I just, I just cannot do it.\n\n11:44.960 --> 11:47.800\n One thing I know that I am good at though,\n\n11:47.800 --> 11:52.800\n is calculating short lines because I calculate them,\n\n11:54.560 --> 11:58.640\n them well, I'm good at seeing little details\n\n11:58.640 --> 12:03.640\n and I'm also much better than, than most at evaluating,\n\n12:05.320 --> 12:08.640\n which I think is something that sets me,\n\n12:08.640 --> 12:11.800\n sets me apart from, from others.\n\n12:11.800 --> 12:15.160\n So evaluating specific position, if I,\n\n12:15.160 --> 12:20.160\n if I make this move and the position changes in this way,\n\n12:20.200 --> 12:22.600\n is this a step in the right direction?\n\n12:22.600 --> 12:24.120\n Like in a big picture way?\n\n12:24.120 --> 12:24.960\n Yeah.\n\n12:24.960 --> 12:27.680\n Like you calculate a few moves ahead and then you evaluate\n\n12:27.680 --> 12:31.000\n because a lot of, a lot of time, a lot of the times\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:34.320\n you cannot, the branches become so big\n\n12:34.320 --> 12:35.960\n that you cannot calculate everything.\n\n12:35.960 --> 12:37.640\n So you have to, yeah.\n\n12:37.640 --> 12:41.200\n So you have to, you have to make evaluations based on,\n\n12:41.200 --> 12:44.880\n you know, based mostly on knowledge\n\n12:44.880 --> 12:49.720\n and intuition and somehow I seem to do that pretty well.\n\n12:49.720 --> 12:51.560\n When you say you're good at short lines,\n\n12:51.560 --> 12:53.840\n what's that, what's, what's short?\n\n12:53.840 --> 12:58.840\n That's usually like lines of two to four moves each.\n\n12:59.120 --> 13:01.160\n Okay, so that, that's directly applicable\n\n13:01.160 --> 13:04.040\n to even faster games like blitz, chess and so on.\n\n13:04.040 --> 13:09.040\n Yeah, blitz is a lot about calculating forest lines.\n\n13:09.280 --> 13:14.280\n So those, you can see pretty clearly that the players\n\n13:14.280 --> 13:17.240\n who struggle at blitz who are great at classical\n\n13:17.240 --> 13:21.600\n are those who rely on a deep calculating ability\n\n13:21.600 --> 13:24.400\n because you simply don't have time for that in blitz.\n\n13:24.400 --> 13:29.080\n You have to calculate quickly and rely a lot on intuition.\n\n13:29.080 --> 13:30.760\n Can you try to, I know it's really difficult.\n\n13:30.760 --> 13:34.240\n Can you try to talk through what's actually\n\n13:34.240 --> 13:36.280\n being visualized in your head?\n\n13:36.280 --> 13:39.200\n Is there, is there a visual component?\n\n13:39.200 --> 13:41.280\n Yeah, no, I just visualized the board.\n\n13:41.280 --> 13:44.800\n I mean, the board is in my head.\n\n13:44.800 --> 13:45.840\n Two dimensional?\n\n13:45.840 --> 13:49.920\n My interpretation is that it is two dimensional.\n\n13:49.920 --> 13:52.680\n Like what color is, is it brown tinted?\n\n13:52.680 --> 13:53.560\n Is it black?\n\n13:53.560 --> 13:56.120\n Is it, like what's the theme?\n\n13:56.120 --> 13:58.200\n Is it a big board, small board?\n\n13:58.200 --> 14:00.800\n Are the, what do the pawns look like?\n\n14:01.920 --> 14:04.080\n Or is it more in the space of concepts?\n\n14:04.080 --> 14:05.320\n Like.\n\n14:05.320 --> 14:07.640\n Yeah, there aren't a lot of colors.\n\n14:07.640 --> 14:09.080\n It's mostly, yeah.\n\n14:09.080 --> 14:11.200\n So what is it?\n\n14:11.200 --> 14:13.040\n Queen's gambit on the ceiling, whatever.\n\n14:13.040 --> 14:16.080\n I'm trying now to imagine it.\n\n14:16.080 --> 14:17.640\n What about when you do the branching,\n\n14:17.640 --> 14:19.040\n when you have multiple boards and so on?\n\n14:19.040 --> 14:20.080\n What, how does that look?\n\n14:20.080 --> 14:20.920\n Are you?\n\n14:20.920 --> 14:21.960\n No, but it's only one at a time.\n\n14:21.960 --> 14:22.800\n So like.\n\n14:22.800 --> 14:23.640\n One position at a time.\n\n14:23.640 --> 14:24.480\n One position at a time.\n\n14:24.480 --> 14:27.400\n So then I go back and that's what, when,\n\n14:27.400 --> 14:30.640\n when people play, or at least that's what I do.\n\n14:30.640 --> 14:33.400\n When I play blindfold chess against several people,\n\n14:33.400 --> 14:35.840\n then it's just always one board at a time.\n\n14:35.840 --> 14:39.120\n And the rest are stored away somewhere.\n\n14:39.120 --> 14:40.440\n But how do you store them away?\n\n14:40.440 --> 14:42.520\n So like, you went down one branch.\n\n14:42.520 --> 14:45.480\n You're like, all right, that's, I got that.\n\n14:45.480 --> 14:47.440\n I understand that there's some good there,\n\n14:47.440 --> 14:48.720\n there's some bad there.\n\n14:48.720 --> 14:50.360\n Now let me go down another branch.\n\n14:50.360 --> 14:52.600\n Like, how do you store away the information?\n\n14:52.600 --> 14:54.440\n You just put it on a shelf, kind of?\n\n14:54.440 --> 14:55.960\n I try and store it away.\n\n14:55.960 --> 14:59.400\n Sometimes I have to sort of repeat it because I forget.\n\n15:00.400 --> 15:02.520\n And it does happen frequently in games\n\n15:02.520 --> 15:06.920\n that you're thinking for,\n\n15:06.920 --> 15:08.520\n especially if you're thinking for a long,\n\n15:08.520 --> 15:09.960\n let's say a half an hour,\n\n15:09.960 --> 15:12.920\n or even more than that, that you play a move\n\n15:12.920 --> 15:14.720\n and then your opponent plays a move,\n\n15:14.720 --> 15:17.160\n then you play a move and they play a move again.\n\n15:17.160 --> 15:20.120\n And you realize, oh, I actually calculated that.\n\n15:20.120 --> 15:21.280\n I just forgot about it.\n\n15:22.280 --> 15:24.280\n So that's obviously what happens\n\n15:24.280 --> 15:26.600\n when you store the information and you cannot retrieve it.\n\n15:26.600 --> 15:30.120\n When you think about a move for 20, 30 minutes,\n\n15:30.120 --> 15:32.360\n like how do you break that down?\n\n15:32.360 --> 15:33.520\n Can you describe what,\n\n15:35.360 --> 15:36.720\n like what's the algorithm here\n\n15:36.720 --> 15:38.680\n that takes 30 minutes to run?\n\n15:38.680 --> 15:43.120\n 30 minutes is, at least for me, it's usually a waste.\n\n15:44.200 --> 15:47.000\n 30 minutes usually means that I don't know what to do.\n\n15:47.920 --> 15:48.760\n And I'm trying.\n\n15:48.760 --> 15:49.840\n You're just running into the wall over and over.\n\n15:49.840 --> 15:52.120\n Yeah, I'm trying to find something that isn't there.\n\n15:52.120 --> 15:55.640\n I think 10 to 15 minutes things\n\n15:55.640 --> 16:00.000\n in complicated positions can be really, really helpful.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:05.000\n Then you can spend your time pretty efficiently.\n\n16:05.360 --> 16:10.360\n Just means that the branches are getting wide.\n\n16:10.360 --> 16:15.360\n There's a lot to run through,\n\n16:15.560 --> 16:17.280\n both in terms of calculation\n\n16:17.280 --> 16:20.000\n and lots you have to evaluate as well.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:24.960\n And then based on that 10 to 15 minute thing,\n\n16:24.960 --> 16:29.280\n you have a pretty good idea what to do.\n\n16:29.280 --> 16:32.520\n I mean, it's very rare that I would think for half an hour\n\n16:32.520 --> 16:35.600\n and I would have a eureka moment during the game.\n\n16:35.600 --> 16:37.560\n Like if I haven't seen it in 10 minutes,\n\n16:37.560 --> 16:39.800\n I'm probably not gonna see it at all.\n\n16:39.800 --> 16:41.280\n You're going to different branches.\n\n16:41.280 --> 16:42.120\n Yeah.\n\n16:42.120 --> 16:43.840\n And like after 15 minutes, it's like.\n\n16:43.840 --> 16:45.280\n But it mainly to the middle game,\n\n16:45.280 --> 16:47.120\n because when you get to the end game,\n\n16:47.120 --> 16:50.320\n it's usually brute force calculation\n\n16:50.320 --> 16:52.920\n that makes you spend so much time.\n\n16:52.920 --> 16:55.600\n So middle game is normally,\n\n16:55.600 --> 16:59.520\n it's a complicated mix of brute force calculation\n\n16:59.520 --> 17:04.520\n and like creativity and evaluation.\n\n17:05.800 --> 17:10.000\n So end game, it's easier in that sense.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:14.280\n Well, you're good at every aspect of chess,\n\n17:14.280 --> 17:16.600\n but you're also your end game is legendary.\n\n17:16.600 --> 17:18.320\n It baffles experts.\n\n17:18.320 --> 17:21.040\n So can you linger on that then try to explain\n\n17:21.040 --> 17:22.240\n what the heck is going on there?\n\n17:22.240 --> 17:23.480\n Like if you look at game six\n\n17:23.480 --> 17:26.560\n of the previous world championship,\n\n17:26.560 --> 17:31.360\n the longest game ever played in chess,\n\n17:31.360 --> 17:36.360\n it was I think his queen versus your rook knight in two pawns.\n\n17:38.960 --> 17:40.360\n There's so many options there.\n\n17:40.360 --> 17:42.560\n It's such an interesting little dance\n\n17:42.560 --> 17:45.280\n and it's kind of not obvious that it wouldn't be a draw.\n\n17:45.280 --> 17:47.960\n So how do you escape it not being a draw\n\n17:47.960 --> 17:49.720\n and you win that match?\n\n17:49.720 --> 17:53.360\n No, I knew that for most of the time,\n\n17:53.360 --> 17:55.800\n it was a theoretical draw\n\n17:55.800 --> 18:00.800\n since chess with seven or less pieces on the board is solved.\n\n18:01.880 --> 18:04.360\n So you can, like people watching online,\n\n18:04.360 --> 18:05.320\n they can just check it.\n\n18:05.320 --> 18:09.480\n They can check and they can check a so called table base\n\n18:09.480 --> 18:13.600\n and they, it just gonna spit out win for white,\n\n18:13.600 --> 18:15.040\n win for black or draw.\n\n18:15.040 --> 18:18.120\n So, and also I knew that,\n\n18:18.120 --> 18:21.360\n I knew that didn't know that position specifically,\n\n18:21.360 --> 18:23.760\n but I knew that it had to be a draw.\n\n18:23.760 --> 18:28.760\n So for me, it was about staying alert.\n\n18:29.640 --> 18:33.920\n First of all, trying to look for the best way\n\n18:33.920 --> 18:37.720\n to put my pieces, but yeah,\n\n18:37.720 --> 18:40.480\n those end games are a bit, they're a bit unusual.\n\n18:40.480 --> 18:43.120\n They don't happen too often.\n\n18:43.120 --> 18:47.440\n So what I'm usually good at is I'm using my strength\n\n18:47.440 --> 18:50.120\n that I also use in middle games\n\n18:50.120 --> 18:53.160\n is that I evaluate well\n\n18:53.160 --> 18:56.520\n and I calculate short variations quite.\n\n18:56.520 --> 18:58.440\n Even for the end game, short variations matter?\n\n18:58.440 --> 19:01.840\n Yes, it does matter in some simpler end games.\n\n19:01.840 --> 19:06.840\n Yeah, but also like there are these theoretical end games\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:10.320\n with very few pieces like rook knights\n\n19:10.320 --> 19:12.160\n and two pawns versus Queens,\n\n19:12.160 --> 19:14.640\n but a lot of end games are simply defined\n\n19:14.640 --> 19:16.800\n by the Queens being exchanged\n\n19:16.800 --> 19:18.680\n and there are a lot of other pieces left\n\n19:18.680 --> 19:21.680\n and then it's usually not brute force.\n\n19:21.680 --> 19:26.120\n It's usually more of understanding and evaluation\n\n19:26.120 --> 19:30.800\n and then I can use my strengths very well.\n\n19:30.800 --> 19:32.560\n Why are you so damn good at the end game?\n\n19:32.560 --> 19:36.480\n Isn't there a lot of moves from when the end game starts\n\n19:36.480 --> 19:38.640\n to when the end game finishes and you have a few pieces\n\n19:38.640 --> 19:39.880\n and you have to figure out,\n\n19:39.880 --> 19:43.520\n it's like a sequence of little games that happens, right?\n\n19:43.520 --> 19:44.840\n Like little pattern.\n\n19:44.840 --> 19:47.880\n Like how does it being able to evaluate a single position\n\n19:47.880 --> 19:51.880\n lead you to evaluate a long sequence of positions\n\n19:51.880 --> 19:53.840\n that eventually lead to a checkmate?\n\n19:53.840 --> 19:57.680\n Well, I think if you evaluate well at the start,\n\n19:57.680 --> 19:59.640\n you know what plans to go for\n\n19:59.640 --> 20:02.000\n and then usually the play from there\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.760\n is often pretty simple.\n\n20:04.760 --> 20:09.760\n Let's say you understand how to arrange your pieces\n\n20:11.320 --> 20:14.880\n and often also how to arrange your pawns\n\n20:14.880 --> 20:19.880\n early in the end game then that makes all the difference\n\n20:21.480 --> 20:26.480\n and after that is like what we call technique very often\n\n20:28.320 --> 20:31.640\n that it's technique basically just means\n\n20:31.640 --> 20:36.160\n that the moves are simple and these are moves\n\n20:36.160 --> 20:39.440\n that a lot of players could make\n\n20:39.440 --> 20:42.080\n not only the very strongest ones.\n\n20:42.080 --> 20:44.560\n These are moves that are kind of understood\n\n20:44.560 --> 20:45.840\n and known.\n\n20:45.840 --> 20:47.120\n So with the evaluation,\n\n20:47.120 --> 20:49.280\n you're just constantly improving a little bit\n\n20:49.280 --> 20:51.880\n and that just leads to suffocating the position\n\n20:51.880 --> 20:53.080\n and then eventually to the win\n\n20:53.080 --> 20:55.560\n as long as you're doing the evaluation well,\n\n20:55.560 --> 20:56.680\n one step at a time.\n\n20:56.680 --> 20:57.920\n To some extent.\n\n20:57.920 --> 21:01.160\n Also, yeah, I said like if you evaluate it better\n\n21:01.160 --> 21:05.440\n and thus accumulated some small advantages\n\n21:05.440 --> 21:10.440\n then you can often make your life pretty easy\n\n21:10.600 --> 21:12.160\n towards the end of the end game.\n\n21:12.160 --> 21:16.360\n So you said in 2019 sort of the second phase\n\n21:16.360 --> 21:18.160\n of why you're so damn good.\n\n21:18.160 --> 21:21.040\n You did a lot of opening preparation.\n\n21:21.040 --> 21:26.040\n What's the goal for you of the opening game of chess?\n\n21:26.760 --> 21:31.040\n Is it to throw the opponent off from any prepared lines?\n\n21:31.040 --> 21:33.080\n Is there something you could put into words\n\n21:33.080 --> 21:35.960\n about why you're so damn good at the openings?\n\n21:35.960 --> 21:40.000\n Again, these things have changed a lot over time.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:43.200\n Back in Kasparov's days, for instance,\n\n21:43.200 --> 21:46.840\n he very often got huge advantages\n\n21:46.840 --> 21:49.440\n from the opening as white.\n\n21:49.440 --> 21:51.120\n Can you explain why?\n\n21:51.120 --> 21:54.400\n There were several reasons for that.\n\n21:54.400 --> 21:56.520\n First of all, he worked harder.\n\n21:56.520 --> 21:59.320\n He was more creative in finding ideas.\n\n21:59.320 --> 22:03.120\n He was able to look places others didn't.\n\n22:03.120 --> 22:05.600\n Also, he had a very strong team of people\n\n22:05.600 --> 22:10.600\n who had specific strengths in openings that he could use.\n\n22:11.680 --> 22:13.000\n So they would come up with ideas\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.800\n and he would integrate those ideas into...\n\n22:15.800 --> 22:17.280\n Yeah, and he would also very often\n\n22:17.280 --> 22:19.840\n come up with them himself.\n\n22:19.840 --> 22:24.840\n Also, at the start, he had some of the first computer engines\n\n22:26.920 --> 22:31.480\n to work for him to find his ideas,\n\n22:31.480 --> 22:34.360\n to look deeper, to verify his ideas.\n\n22:34.360 --> 22:39.160\n He was better at using them than a lot of others.\n\n22:39.160 --> 22:44.160\n Now, I feel like the playing field is a lot more level.\n\n22:44.240 --> 22:48.960\n There are both computer engines, neural networks,\n\n22:48.960 --> 22:53.840\n and hybrid engines available to practically anybody.\n\n22:53.840 --> 22:58.840\n So it's much harder to find ideas now\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:03.320\n that actually give you an advantage\n\n23:03.320 --> 23:05.240\n with the white pieces.\n\n23:05.240 --> 23:08.360\n I mean, people don't expect to find those ideas anymore.\n\n23:08.360 --> 23:11.720\n Now it's all about finding ideas\n\n23:11.720 --> 23:15.840\n that are missed by the engines.\n\n23:15.840 --> 23:18.960\n Either they're missed entirely\n\n23:18.960 --> 23:20.960\n or they're missed at low depth\n\n23:22.280 --> 23:26.040\n and using them to gain some advantage\n\n23:26.040 --> 23:28.440\n in the sense that you have more knowledge.\n\n23:28.440 --> 23:33.440\n And it's also good to know that usually\n\n23:34.240 --> 23:37.360\n these are not complete bluffs, these are like semi bluffs\n\n23:37.360 --> 23:39.520\n so that you know that even if your opponent\n\n23:39.520 --> 23:43.320\n makes all the right moves, you can still make a draw.\n\n23:43.320 --> 23:46.960\n And also at the start of 2019,\n\n23:46.960 --> 23:50.680\n neural networks had just started to be a thing in chess.\n\n23:50.680 --> 23:52.960\n And I'm not entirely sure,\n\n23:52.960 --> 23:55.120\n but there were at least some players\n\n23:55.120 --> 24:00.120\n even in the top events who you could see did not use them\n\n24:00.320 --> 24:02.320\n or did not use them in the right way.\n\n24:02.320 --> 24:04.920\n And then you could gain a huge advantage\n\n24:04.920 --> 24:06.720\n because a lot of positions,\n\n24:06.720 --> 24:09.520\n they were being evaluated differently\n\n24:09.520 --> 24:13.000\n by the neural networks than traditional chess engines\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.920\n because they simply think about chess\n\n24:15.920 --> 24:18.760\n in a very, very different way.\n\n24:18.760 --> 24:21.760\n So short answer is these days,\n\n24:21.760 --> 24:25.240\n it's all about surprising your opponent\n\n24:25.240 --> 24:29.360\n and taking it into positions where you have more knowledge.\n\n24:29.360 --> 24:31.960\n So is there some sense in which it's okay\n\n24:31.960 --> 24:34.840\n to make suboptimal quote unquote moves?\n\n24:34.840 --> 24:36.240\n No, you have to.\n\n24:36.240 --> 24:39.560\n I mean, you have to because the best moves\n\n24:39.560 --> 24:42.600\n have been analyzed to death mostly.\n\n24:42.600 --> 24:44.640\n So that's a kind of, when you say semi bluff,\n\n24:44.640 --> 24:46.600\n that's a kind of sacrifice.\n\n24:46.600 --> 24:50.000\n You're sacrificing the optimal move,\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:53.960\n the optimal position so that you can take the opponent.\n\n24:53.960 --> 24:55.880\n I mean, that's a game theoretic sense.\n\n24:55.880 --> 24:59.080\n You take the opponent to something they didn't prepare well.\n\n24:59.080 --> 25:02.400\n Yeah, but you could also look at it another way\n\n25:02.400 --> 25:07.320\n that regardless, like if you turn on whatever engine\n\n25:07.320 --> 25:09.520\n you turn on, like if you try to analyze\n\n25:09.520 --> 25:11.480\n either from the starting position\n\n25:11.480 --> 25:15.000\n or the starting position of some popular opening,\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.480\n like if you analyze long enough,\n\n25:17.480 --> 25:19.400\n it's always gonna end up in a draw.\n\n25:19.400 --> 25:23.200\n So in that sense, you may not be going\n\n25:23.200 --> 25:26.040\n for like the objective, the tries\n\n25:26.040 --> 25:29.800\n that are objectively the most difficult to draw against,\n\n25:29.800 --> 25:32.640\n but you are trying to look at least\n\n25:32.640 --> 25:35.400\n at the less obvious paths.\n\n25:35.400 --> 25:37.680\n How much do you use engines?\n\n25:37.680 --> 25:41.920\n Do you use Leela, Stockfish in your preparations?\n\n25:41.920 --> 25:43.600\n My team does.\n\n25:43.600 --> 25:47.880\n Personally, I try not to use them too much\n\n25:47.880 --> 25:51.920\n on my own because I know that when I play,\n\n25:51.920 --> 25:54.960\n you obviously cannot have help from engines.\n\n25:54.960 --> 25:59.480\n And often I feel like often having imperfect\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:05.080\n or knowledge about a position or some engine knowledge\n\n26:05.080 --> 26:09.520\n can be a lot worse than having no knowledge.\n\n26:09.520 --> 26:13.400\n So I try to look at engines as little as possible.\n\n26:13.400 --> 26:15.840\n So yeah, so your team uses them for research\n\n26:15.840 --> 26:17.320\n for a generation of ideas.\n\n26:17.320 --> 26:18.160\n Yeah.\n\n26:18.160 --> 26:23.160\n But you are relying primarily on your human resources.\n\n26:23.600 --> 26:24.440\n Yeah, for sure.\n\n26:24.440 --> 26:26.000\n You can evaluate well.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:26.840\n You don't lean.\n\n26:26.840 --> 26:29.000\n Yeah, I can evaluate as a human.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:33.320\n I can know what they find unpleasant and so on.\n\n26:33.320 --> 26:38.320\n And it's very often the case for me to some extent,\n\n26:38.480 --> 26:42.200\n but a lot for others that you arrive in a position\n\n26:43.320 --> 26:46.240\n and your opponent plays a move that you didn't expect\n\n26:46.240 --> 26:49.520\n and if you didn't expect it,\n\n26:49.520 --> 26:51.840\n you know that it's probably not a great move\n\n26:51.840 --> 26:54.520\n since it hasn't been expected by the engine.\n\n26:54.520 --> 26:59.520\n But if it's not obvious why it's not a good move,\n\n27:00.480 --> 27:03.840\n it's usually very, very hard to figure it out.\n\n27:03.840 --> 27:08.360\n And so then looking at the engines doesn't necessarily help\n\n27:08.360 --> 27:10.920\n because at that point, like you're facing a human,\n\n27:10.920 --> 27:14.040\n you have to sort of think as a human.\n\n27:14.040 --> 27:16.720\n I was chatting with Demis Ashabis, CEO of DeepMind\n\n27:16.720 --> 27:19.080\n a couple of days ago and he asked me to ask you\n\n27:19.080 --> 27:24.080\n about what you first felt when you saw the play of AlphaZero.\n\n27:24.920 --> 27:28.720\n Like interesting ideas in your creativity.\n\n27:28.720 --> 27:31.480\n Did you feel fear that the machine is taking over?\n\n27:31.480 --> 27:32.880\n Were you inspired?\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:37.240\n And what was going on in your mind and heart?\n\n27:37.240 --> 27:42.240\n Funny thing about Demis is he doesn't play chess at all\n\n27:42.240 --> 27:47.240\n like an AI, he plays in a very, very human way.\n\n27:48.560 --> 27:53.320\n No, I was hugely inspired when I saw the games at first.\n\n27:54.360 --> 27:58.200\n And in terms of man versus machine,\n\n27:58.200 --> 28:02.080\n I mean that battle was kind of lost for humans\n\n28:02.080 --> 28:07.080\n even before I entered top level chess.\n\n28:07.960 --> 28:10.440\n So that's never been an issue for me.\n\n28:10.440 --> 28:14.200\n I never liked playing against computers much anyway.\n\n28:14.200 --> 28:16.080\n So that's completely fine.\n\n28:16.080 --> 28:20.400\n But it was amazing to see how they quote unquote\n\n28:20.400 --> 28:23.480\n thought about chess in such a different way\n\n28:23.480 --> 28:27.640\n and in a way that you could mistake for creativity.\n\n28:27.640 --> 28:30.480\n Mistake for creativity, strong words.\n\n28:30.480 --> 28:33.400\n Is it wild to you how many sacrifices it's willing to make\n\n28:33.400 --> 28:36.000\n that like sacrifice pieces and then wait\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:37.320\n for prolonged periods of time\n\n28:37.320 --> 28:38.960\n before doing anything with that?\n\n28:38.960 --> 28:42.440\n Is that weird to you that that's part of chess?\n\n28:42.440 --> 28:46.520\n No, it's one of the things that's hardest to replicate\n\n28:46.520 --> 28:50.640\n as a human as well, or at least for my playing style\n\n28:50.640 --> 28:54.840\n that usually when I sacrifice, I feel like I'm,\n\n28:56.360 --> 28:58.880\n I don't do it unless I feel like I'm getting something\n\n28:58.880 --> 29:03.360\n like tangible in return and.\n\n29:03.360 --> 29:05.000\n Like a few moves down the line.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.200\n A few moves down the line,\n\n29:06.200 --> 29:08.760\n you can see that you can either retrieve the material\n\n29:08.760 --> 29:12.240\n or you can put your opponent's king under pressure\n\n29:12.240 --> 29:16.680\n or have some very like very concrete positional advantage\n\n29:16.680 --> 29:20.520\n that sort of compensates for it.\n\n29:20.520 --> 29:22.840\n For instance, in chess,\n\n29:22.840 --> 29:25.640\n so bishops and knights are fairly equivalent.\n\n29:26.720 --> 29:28.600\n We both give them three points,\n\n29:28.600 --> 29:30.320\n but bishops are a little bit better.\n\n29:30.320 --> 29:33.360\n And especially a bishop pair is a lot better\n\n29:33.360 --> 29:36.080\n than a bishop and a knight.\n\n29:36.080 --> 29:40.440\n So, or especially two knights depends on the position,\n\n29:40.440 --> 29:44.120\n but like on average they are.\n\n29:44.120 --> 29:49.120\n So like sacrificing a pawn in order to get a bishop pair,\n\n29:49.720 --> 29:52.360\n that's one of the most common sacrifices in chess.\n\n29:52.360 --> 29:53.560\n Oh, you're okay making that sacrifice?\n\n29:53.560 --> 29:55.720\n Yeah, I mean, it depends on the situation,\n\n29:55.720 --> 29:57.600\n but generally that's fine.\n\n29:57.600 --> 30:00.040\n And there are a lot of openings that are based on that,\n\n30:00.040 --> 30:03.360\n that you sacrifice a pawn for the bishop pair,\n\n30:03.360 --> 30:07.360\n and then eventually it's some sort of positional equality.\n\n30:07.360 --> 30:08.440\n So that's fine.\n\n30:08.440 --> 30:13.440\n But the way AlphaZero would sacrifice a knight\n\n30:14.640 --> 30:18.440\n or sometimes two pawns, three pawns,\n\n30:18.440 --> 30:20.000\n and you could see that it's looking\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\n for some sort of positional domination,\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.320\n but it's hard to understand.\n\n30:24.320 --> 30:27.800\n And it was really fascinating to see.\n\n30:27.800 --> 30:32.800\n Yeah, in 2019, I was sacrificing a lot of pawns,\n\n30:33.520 --> 30:36.560\n especially, and it was a great joy.\n\n30:36.560 --> 30:40.000\n Unfortunately, it's not so easy to continue to do that.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:45.000\n People have found more solid opening lines since\n\n30:45.400 --> 30:48.760\n that don't allow me to do that as often.\n\n30:48.760 --> 30:51.200\n I'm still trying both to get those positions\n\n30:51.200 --> 30:56.200\n and still trying to learn the art of sacrificing pieces.\n\n30:56.200 --> 31:01.200\n So Demis also made a comment that was interesting\n\n31:01.200 --> 31:04.440\n to my new chess brain, which is one of the reasons\n\n31:04.440 --> 31:06.600\n that chess is fun is because of the, quote,\n\n31:06.600 --> 31:09.440\n creative tension between the bishop and the knight.\n\n31:09.440 --> 31:13.360\n So you're talking about this interesting difference\n\n31:13.360 --> 31:16.520\n between the two pieces, that there's some kind of,\n\n31:16.520 --> 31:17.680\n how would you convert that?\n\n31:17.680 --> 31:20.420\n I mean, that's like a poetic statement about chess.\n\n31:20.420 --> 31:22.820\n I think he said that, why has chess been played\n\n31:22.820 --> 31:24.020\n for such a long time?\n\n31:24.020 --> 31:26.800\n Why is it so fun to play at every level?\n\n31:26.800 --> 31:28.640\n That if you can reduce it to one thing,\n\n31:28.640 --> 31:31.280\n is it the bishop and the knight,\n\n31:31.280 --> 31:34.400\n some kind of weird dynamics that they create in chess.\n\n31:34.400 --> 31:36.460\n Is there any truth to that?\n\n31:36.460 --> 31:38.320\n It sounds very good.\n\n31:38.320 --> 31:41.000\n I haven't tried a lot of other games,\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.460\n but I tried to play a little bit of shogi.\n\n31:43.460 --> 31:48.200\n And for my new shogi brain, comparing it to chess,\n\n31:48.200 --> 31:53.000\n what annoyed me about that game is how much the pieces suck.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.480\n Basically, you have one rook and you have one bishop\n\n31:55.480 --> 31:56.800\n that move like in chess.\n\n31:56.800 --> 32:01.720\n And the rest of the pieces are really not very powerful.\n\n32:01.720 --> 32:05.560\n So I think that's one of the attractions of chess,\n\n32:05.560 --> 32:10.400\n like how powerful, especially the queen is, which.\n\n32:10.400 --> 32:11.280\n Interesting.\n\n32:11.280 --> 32:14.480\n I kind of think makes it a lot of fun.\n\n32:14.480 --> 32:19.480\n So you think power is more fun than like variety?\n\n32:19.480 --> 32:23.520\n No, there is a variety in chess as well, though.\n\n32:23.520 --> 32:27.720\n But not much more so than like go or something.\n\n32:27.720 --> 32:29.680\n No, no, no, no, that's for.\n\n32:29.680 --> 32:32.560\n So like knight, I mean, they all move in different ways.\n\n32:32.560 --> 32:33.920\n They're all like weird.\n\n32:33.920 --> 32:36.300\n There's just all these weird patterns and positions\n\n32:36.300 --> 32:37.440\n that can emerge.\n\n32:37.440 --> 32:39.160\n The difference in the pieces create\n\n32:39.160 --> 32:40.440\n all kinds of interesting dynamics,\n\n32:40.440 --> 32:41.480\n I guess is what I'm trying to say.\n\n32:41.480 --> 32:44.880\n Yeah, and I guess it is quite fascinating\n\n32:44.880 --> 32:47.080\n that all those years ago,\n\n32:47.080 --> 32:50.280\n they created the knight and the bishop\n\n32:50.280 --> 32:53.720\n without probably realizing that they would be\n\n32:53.720 --> 32:57.680\n almost equally strong with such different qualities.\n\n32:57.680 --> 32:59.600\n That's crazy that this, you know,\n\n32:59.600 --> 33:02.040\n like when you design computer games,\n\n33:02.040 --> 33:03.400\n it's like an art form.\n\n33:03.400 --> 33:06.120\n It's science and an art to balance it.\n\n33:06.120 --> 33:09.440\n You know, you talk about Starcraft and all those games,\n\n33:09.440 --> 33:12.080\n like so that you can have competitive play\n\n33:12.080 --> 33:16.080\n at the highest level with all those different units.\n\n33:16.080 --> 33:19.240\n In the case of chess, it's different pieces.\n\n33:19.240 --> 33:21.440\n And they somehow designed a game\n\n33:21.440 --> 33:22.800\n that was super competitive.\n\n33:22.800 --> 33:24.540\n But there's probably some kind of natural selection\n\n33:24.540 --> 33:27.560\n that the chess just wouldn't last if it was designed poorly.\n\n33:27.560 --> 33:32.380\n Yeah, and I think the rules have changed over time\n\n33:32.380 --> 33:35.120\n a little bit, but I would be,\n\n33:35.120 --> 33:37.680\n I mean, speaking of games and all that,\n\n33:37.680 --> 33:42.680\n I'm also interested to play other games like chess 960\n\n33:42.680 --> 33:46.040\n or Fisher random, as they call it,\n\n33:46.040 --> 33:50.560\n like that you have 960 maps instead of one.\n\n33:50.560 --> 33:52.360\n Yeah, so for people who don't know,\n\n33:52.360 --> 33:54.680\n a Fisher random chess, chess 960s.\n\n33:54.680 --> 33:56.160\n Yeah, that basically just means\n\n33:56.160 --> 33:57.720\n that the pawns are in the same way\n\n33:57.720 --> 34:02.720\n and the major pieces are distributed randomly\n\n34:03.100 --> 34:04.520\n on the last rank.\n\n34:04.520 --> 34:06.400\n Only that there have to be obviously\n\n34:06.400 --> 34:07.800\n bishops of opposite color\n\n34:07.800 --> 34:10.400\n and the king has to be in between the rooks\n\n34:10.400 --> 34:12.460\n so that you can castle both ways.\n\n34:12.460 --> 34:13.800\n Oh, you can still castle in chess 960.\n\n34:13.800 --> 34:16.440\n You can still castle, but it makes it interesting.\n\n34:16.440 --> 34:20.600\n So you still have, it still castles in the same way.\n\n34:20.600 --> 34:22.960\n So let's say the king is like here.\n\n34:22.960 --> 34:24.120\n Yeah, what happens in that case?\n\n34:24.120 --> 34:26.600\n Yeah, let's say the king is in the corner.\n\n34:28.120 --> 34:29.800\n So to castle this side,\n\n34:29.800 --> 34:32.300\n you have to clear a whole lot of pieces.\n\n34:33.400 --> 34:35.320\n Well, what would castling look like though?\n\n34:35.320 --> 34:38.080\n No, the king would go here and the rook would go there.\n\n34:38.080 --> 34:39.400\n Oh, okay.\n\n34:39.400 --> 34:41.680\n And that's happened in my games as well.\n\n34:41.680 --> 34:43.720\n Like I forgot about castling\n\n34:43.720 --> 34:46.800\n and I've been like attacking a king over here\n\n34:46.800 --> 34:50.560\n and then all of a sudden it escapes to the other side.\n\n34:50.560 --> 34:55.560\n I think Fischer chess is good that it's,\n\n34:57.000 --> 35:02.000\n the maps will generally be worse than regular chess.\n\n35:03.320 --> 35:08.320\n Like I think the starting position is as close to ideal\n\n35:08.480 --> 35:11.600\n for creating a competitive game as possible,\n\n35:11.600 --> 35:14.760\n but they will still be like interesting and diverse enough\n\n35:14.760 --> 35:18.440\n that you can play very interesting games.\n\n35:18.440 --> 35:21.060\n So when you say maps, there's 960 different options\n\n35:21.060 --> 35:24.840\n and like what fraction of that creates interesting games\n\n35:24.840 --> 35:26.080\n at the highest level?\n\n35:26.080 --> 35:28.600\n This is something that a lot of people are curious about\n\n35:28.600 --> 35:32.120\n because when you challenge a great chess player\n\n35:32.120 --> 35:37.120\n like yourself to look at a random starting position\n\n35:38.160 --> 35:41.200\n that feels like it pushes you to play pure chess\n\n35:41.200 --> 35:42.400\n versus memorizing lines.\n\n35:42.400 --> 35:43.800\n Oh yeah, for sure, for sure.\n\n35:43.800 --> 35:45.680\n But that's the whole idea.\n\n35:45.680 --> 35:47.280\n That's what you want.\n\n35:47.280 --> 35:48.120\n How hard is it to play?\n\n35:48.120 --> 35:50.560\n I mean, can you talk about what it feels like to you\n\n35:50.560 --> 35:53.020\n to play with a random starting position?\n\n35:53.020 --> 35:55.480\n Is there some intuition you've been building up?\n\n35:55.480 --> 35:57.220\n It's very, very different.\n\n35:57.220 --> 36:02.040\n And I mean, understandably engines have\n\n36:02.040 --> 36:05.080\n an even greater advantage in 960\n\n36:05.080 --> 36:08.440\n than they have in classical chess.\n\n36:08.440 --> 36:10.160\n No, it's super interesting.\n\n36:10.160 --> 36:13.880\n And that's why also I really wish\n\n36:13.880 --> 36:17.800\n that we played more classical chess,\n\n36:17.800 --> 36:21.640\n like long games, four to seven hours\n\n36:21.640 --> 36:25.840\n and in fish random chess, chess 960,\n\n36:25.840 --> 36:29.720\n because then you really need that time,\n\n36:29.720 --> 36:31.400\n even on the first moves.\n\n36:31.400 --> 36:34.040\n What usually happens is that you get 15 minutes\n\n36:34.040 --> 36:36.280\n before the game, you're getting told the position\n\n36:36.280 --> 36:37.780\n 15 minutes before the game,\n\n36:37.780 --> 36:40.520\n and then you can think about it a little bit,\n\n36:40.520 --> 36:42.760\n even, you know, check the computer,\n\n36:42.760 --> 36:45.200\n but that's all the time you have,\n\n36:45.200 --> 36:46.840\n but then you really need to figure it out.\n\n36:46.840 --> 36:50.880\n And like some of the positions obviously\n\n36:50.880 --> 36:53.360\n are a lot more interesting than the others.\n\n36:53.360 --> 36:55.320\n In some of them, it appears that like,\n\n36:55.320 --> 37:00.280\n if you don't play symmetrically at the start,\n\n37:00.280 --> 37:03.840\n then you're probably gonna be in a pretty bad position.\n\n37:03.840 --> 37:04.960\n What do you mean with the pawns?\n\n37:04.960 --> 37:06.480\n With the pawns, yeah.\n\n37:06.480 --> 37:08.320\n Why does that make sense?\n\n37:08.320 --> 37:09.980\n That's the thing about chess though.\n\n37:09.980 --> 37:13.160\n So let's say white opens with E4,\n\n37:13.160 --> 37:17.360\n which is, which has always been the most played move.\n\n37:17.360 --> 37:18.880\n There are many ways to meet that,\n\n37:18.880 --> 37:21.400\n but the most solid ways of playing\n\n37:21.400 --> 37:23.240\n has always been the symmetrical response.\n\n37:23.240 --> 37:24.080\n Yeah.\n\n37:24.080 --> 37:26.320\n With E5, and then there's the,\n\n37:26.320 --> 37:30.640\n through Lopez, there's the Petrov opening and so on.\n\n37:30.640 --> 37:35.640\n And if you just banned symmetry on the first move in chess,\n\n37:35.640 --> 37:37.720\n you would get more interesting games.\n\n37:37.720 --> 37:39.040\n Oh, interesting.\n\n37:39.040 --> 37:43.500\n Or you'd get more decisive, decisive games.\n\n37:43.500 --> 37:45.280\n So that's the good thing about chess\n\n37:45.280 --> 37:46.720\n is that we've played it so long\n\n37:46.720 --> 37:50.140\n that we've actually devised non symmetrical openings\n\n37:50.140 --> 37:53.640\n that are also fairly equal and.\n\n37:53.640 --> 37:55.320\n But symmetry is a good default.\n\n37:55.320 --> 37:57.020\n But yeah, symmetry is a good default.\n\n37:57.020 --> 38:00.880\n And it's a problem that by playing symmetrical\n\n38:00.880 --> 38:03.640\n armed with good preparation in regular chess,\n\n38:03.640 --> 38:06.840\n it's just a little bit too easy to,\n\n38:06.840 --> 38:08.400\n it's a little bit too dryish.\n\n38:08.400 --> 38:11.960\n And I guess if you analyzed,\n\n38:11.960 --> 38:14.800\n if you analyzed a lot in chess 960,\n\n38:14.800 --> 38:19.480\n then the, a lot of the positions\n\n38:19.480 --> 38:24.200\n would end up being pretty dryish as well.\n\n38:24.200 --> 38:26.960\n Because the random starting points are so shitty,\n\n38:26.960 --> 38:28.160\n you're forced to.\n\n38:28.160 --> 38:30.480\n You're actually forced to play symmetrically.\n\n38:30.480 --> 38:33.280\n Like you cannot actually try and play\n\n38:33.280 --> 38:36.540\n in a more sort of interesting, interesting manner.\n\n38:37.600 --> 38:39.280\n Is there any other kind of variations\n\n38:39.280 --> 38:41.360\n that are interesting to you?\n\n38:41.360 --> 38:43.640\n Oh yeah, there are, there are several.\n\n38:43.640 --> 38:46.300\n So no castling chess has been,\n\n38:47.440 --> 38:50.560\n has been promoted by former world champion,\n\n38:50.560 --> 38:52.200\n Vladimir Kramnik.\n\n38:52.200 --> 38:55.040\n There have been a few tournaments with that,\n\n38:55.040 --> 38:59.280\n not any that I've participated in though.\n\n38:59.280 --> 39:00.740\n I kind of like it.\n\n39:00.740 --> 39:05.680\n Also, my coach uses like non castling engines quite a bit\n\n39:05.680 --> 39:08.520\n to analyze regular positions\n\n39:08.520 --> 39:13.280\n to just to get a different, different perspective.\n\n39:13.280 --> 39:15.160\n So castling is like a defensive thing.\n\n39:15.160 --> 39:16.800\n So if you remove castling,\n\n39:16.800 --> 39:19.240\n it forces you to be more offensive, is that why?\n\n39:19.240 --> 39:23.240\n Yeah, it just, yeah, for sure.\n\n39:23.240 --> 39:26.240\n It seems like a tiny little difference.\n\n39:26.240 --> 39:28.420\n No castling probably forces you\n\n39:28.420 --> 39:31.880\n to be a little bit more defensive at the start,\n\n39:31.880 --> 39:33.760\n or I would guess so,\n\n39:33.760 --> 39:37.560\n because you cannot suddenly escape with the kings.\n\n39:37.560 --> 39:40.040\n It's going to make the game a bit slower at the start,\n\n39:40.040 --> 39:43.360\n but I feel like eventually it's going to,\n\n39:45.680 --> 39:47.680\n it's going to make the more games more,\n\n39:48.960 --> 39:51.360\n well, less droish for sure.\n\n39:51.360 --> 39:53.760\n Then you have some weirder variants,\n\n39:53.760 --> 39:58.760\n like where the pawns can move both diagonally and forward.\n\n40:02.400 --> 40:04.700\n And also you have self capture chess,\n\n40:04.700 --> 40:06.440\n which is quite interesting.\n\n40:06.440 --> 40:08.000\n So that pawns can,\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:10.440\n or pieces could commit suicide or what?\n\n40:10.440 --> 40:11.480\n Yeah, people can.\n\n40:11.480 --> 40:13.920\n Why would that be a good move?\n\n40:13.920 --> 40:17.640\n No, sometimes one of your pieces occupy a square.\n\n40:17.640 --> 40:20.880\n I mean, let me just set up a position.\n\n40:20.880 --> 40:25.880\n Let's put it like this, for instance, like here.\n\n40:26.560 --> 40:29.520\n I mean, there are a lot of ways to checkmate for white,\n\n40:29.520 --> 40:32.640\n like this for instance, or there are several ways,\n\n40:32.640 --> 40:36.620\n but like this would be a checkmate.\n\n40:36.620 --> 40:38.160\n Oh, cool.\n\n40:38.160 --> 40:39.400\n For people who are just listening,\n\n40:39.400 --> 40:42.040\n yeah, basically you're bringing in a knight close\n\n40:42.040 --> 40:45.080\n to the whole, the king, the queen and so on,\n\n40:45.080 --> 40:46.880\n and you replace the knight with a queen.\n\n40:46.880 --> 40:47.800\n Yeah, that's interesting.\n\n40:47.800 --> 40:51.840\n So you can have like a front of pieces,\n\n40:51.840 --> 40:54.280\n and then you just replace them with the second piece.\n\n40:54.280 --> 40:56.600\n Yeah, I mean, that could be interesting.\n\n40:56.600 --> 41:00.480\n I think also maybe sometimes it's just clearance,\n\n41:00.480 --> 41:04.880\n basically it adds an extra element of clearance.\n\n41:04.880 --> 41:09.680\n So I think there are many, many different variants.\n\n41:09.680 --> 41:13.800\n I don't think any of them are better than the one\n\n41:13.800 --> 41:17.120\n that has been played for at least a thousand years,\n\n41:17.120 --> 41:22.120\n but it's certainly interesting to see.\n\n41:22.360 --> 41:24.000\n So one of your goals is to reach\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:27.880\n the FIDEELO chess rating of 2900.\n\n41:27.880 --> 41:30.360\n Maybe you can comment on how is this rating calculated\n\n41:30.360 --> 41:33.560\n and what does it take to get there?\n\n41:33.560 --> 41:36.160\n Is it possible for a human being to get there?\n\n41:36.160 --> 41:39.800\n Basically you play with a factor of 10,\n\n41:39.800 --> 41:44.120\n which means that if I were to play against an opponent\n\n41:44.120 --> 41:48.040\n who's rated the same as me, I would be expected\n\n41:49.120 --> 41:51.240\n to score 50%, obviously, and that means\n\n41:51.240 --> 41:54.360\n that I would win five points with a win,\n\n41:54.360 --> 41:57.760\n lose five points with a draw, and then equal if I draw.\n\n41:57.760 --> 42:00.800\n If your opponent is 200 points lower rated,\n\n42:00.800 --> 42:05.720\n you're expected to score 75% and so on.\n\n42:05.720 --> 42:08.080\n And you establish that rating by playing a lot of people,\n\n42:08.080 --> 42:11.040\n and then it slowly converges towards an estimate\n\n42:11.040 --> 42:13.240\n of how likely you are to win or lose against different people.\n\n42:13.240 --> 42:16.680\n Yeah, and my rating is obviously carried\n\n42:16.680 --> 42:19.700\n through thousands of games.\n\n42:20.720 --> 42:25.720\n Right now, my rating is 2861, which is decent.\n\n42:26.080 --> 42:28.920\n I think that pretty much corresponds\n\n42:28.920 --> 42:32.680\n to the level I have at the moment,\n\n42:32.680 --> 42:36.320\n which means in order to reach 2900,\n\n42:36.320 --> 42:40.040\n I would have to either get better at chess,\n\n42:40.040 --> 42:45.040\n which I think is fairly hard to do,\n\n42:45.520 --> 42:47.200\n at least considerably better.\n\n42:47.200 --> 42:51.440\n So what I would need to do is try and optimize\n\n42:51.440 --> 42:56.440\n even more in terms of preparations, everything.\n\n42:56.440 --> 42:59.680\n Not necessarily like selecting tournaments and so on,\n\n42:59.680 --> 43:04.640\n but just optimizing in terms of preparation,\n\n43:04.640 --> 43:08.960\n making sure I never have any bad days.\n\n43:08.960 --> 43:10.600\n So you basically can't lose.\n\n43:10.600 --> 43:13.440\n Yeah, I basically can't fuck up ever\n\n43:13.440 --> 43:17.560\n if I wanna reach that goal.\n\n43:17.560 --> 43:22.560\n And so I think reaching 2900 is pretty unlikely.\n\n43:22.800 --> 43:26.360\n The reason I've set the goal is to have something\n\n43:26.360 --> 43:31.120\n to play for, to have a motivation\n\n43:31.120 --> 43:36.000\n to actually try and be at my best when I play.\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:40.560\n Because otherwise, I'm playing to some extent,\n\n43:40.560 --> 43:45.480\n mostly for fun these days in that I love to play,\n\n43:45.480 --> 43:50.480\n I love to try and win, but I don't have a lot to prove\n\n43:51.520 --> 43:55.080\n or anything, but that gives me at least the motivation\n\n43:55.080 --> 43:59.000\n to try and be at my best all the time,\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:02.240\n which I think is something to aim for.\n\n44:02.240 --> 44:05.760\n So at the moment, I'm quite enjoying that process\n\n44:05.760 --> 44:10.760\n of trying to, yeah, trying to optimize.\n\n44:12.080 --> 44:15.600\n What would you say motivates you in this now\n\n44:15.600 --> 44:17.960\n and in the years leading up to now?\n\n44:17.960 --> 44:21.100\n The love of winning or the fear of losing?\n\n44:22.880 --> 44:25.880\n So for the World Championship,\n\n44:25.880 --> 44:29.360\n it's been fear of losing for sure.\n\n44:29.360 --> 44:34.360\n Other tournaments, love of winning is a great, great factor\n\n44:34.360 --> 44:36.800\n and that's why I also get more joy\n\n44:36.800 --> 44:39.320\n from winning most tournaments than I do\n\n44:39.320 --> 44:41.200\n for winning the World Championship\n\n44:41.200 --> 44:44.560\n because then it's mostly been a relief.\n\n44:44.560 --> 44:48.520\n I also think I enjoy winning more now than I did before\n\n44:48.520 --> 44:52.800\n because I feel like I'm a little bit more relaxed now.\n\n44:52.800 --> 44:57.080\n And I also know that it's not gonna last forever.\n\n44:57.080 --> 45:02.080\n So every little win, I appreciate a lot more now.\n\n45:02.080 --> 45:05.680\n And yeah, in terms of fear of losing,\n\n45:05.680 --> 45:08.720\n that's a huge reason why I'm not gonna play\n\n45:08.720 --> 45:09.640\n the World Championship\n\n45:09.640 --> 45:14.640\n because it really didn't give me a lot of joy.\n\n45:14.640 --> 45:17.320\n It really was all about avoiding losing.\n\n45:17.320 --> 45:19.320\n Why is it that the World Championship\n\n45:19.320 --> 45:22.280\n really makes you feel this way, the anxiety?\n\n45:22.280 --> 45:26.240\n So when you say losing, do you mean not just the match\n\n45:26.240 --> 45:31.240\n but every single position, like the fear of a blunder?\n\n45:31.240 --> 45:32.960\n No, I mean, the blunder is okay.\n\n45:32.960 --> 45:34.960\n Like when I sit down at the board,\n\n45:34.960 --> 45:38.560\n then it's mostly been fine because then I'm focused on.\n\n45:38.560 --> 45:39.400\n Got it.\n\n45:39.400 --> 45:40.560\n Then I'm focused on the game\n\n45:40.560 --> 45:42.520\n and then I know that I can play the game.\n\n45:42.520 --> 45:45.680\n It's a time like in between, like knowing that,\n\n45:45.680 --> 45:49.120\n you know, I feel like losing is not an option\n\n45:49.120 --> 45:50.640\n because it's the World Championship\n\n45:50.640 --> 45:53.320\n and because in a World Championship, there are two players.\n\n45:53.320 --> 45:56.120\n There's a winner and a loser.\n\n45:56.120 --> 45:59.760\n If I don't win a random tournament that I play,\n\n45:59.760 --> 46:03.680\n then, you know, I'm usually, it depends on the tournament.\n\n46:03.680 --> 46:06.320\n I might be disappointed for sure.\n\n46:06.320 --> 46:07.760\n Might even be pretty pissed,\n\n46:07.760 --> 46:11.920\n but ultimately, you know, you go on to the next one.\n\n46:11.920 --> 46:12.800\n With the World Championship,\n\n46:12.800 --> 46:14.920\n you don't go on to the next one.\n\n46:14.920 --> 46:17.400\n It's like, it's years.\n\n46:17.400 --> 46:18.240\n Yeah.\n\n46:18.240 --> 46:20.880\n And it also has been like,\n\n46:20.880 --> 46:24.280\n it's been a core part of my identity for a while now\n\n46:24.280 --> 46:26.440\n that I am World Champion.\n\n46:26.440 --> 46:31.440\n And so there's not an option of losing that.\n\n46:31.640 --> 46:32.480\n Yeah.\n\n46:32.480 --> 46:34.360\n Yeah, there's, you're gonna have to,\n\n46:34.360 --> 46:36.000\n at least for a couple of years,\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:39.440\n carry the weight of having lost.\n\n46:39.440 --> 46:42.360\n You're the former World Champion now,\n\n46:42.360 --> 46:46.040\n if you lose versus the current World Champion.\n\n46:46.040 --> 46:51.040\n There are certain sports that create that anxiety\n\n46:51.080 --> 46:52.360\n and others that don't.\n\n46:52.360 --> 46:55.640\n For example, I think UFC, like mixed martial arts\n\n46:55.640 --> 46:57.560\n are a little better with losing.\n\n46:57.560 --> 47:00.360\n It's understood, like everybody loses.\n\n47:00.360 --> 47:01.200\n But then.\n\n47:01.200 --> 47:02.040\n Not everybody though.\n\n47:02.040 --> 47:02.880\n Not everybody.\n\n47:02.880 --> 47:03.720\n Not everybody.\n\n47:03.720 --> 47:04.560\n Not everybody.\n\n47:04.560 --> 47:05.680\n Yes.\n\n47:05.680 --> 47:07.040\n Khabib entered the chat.\n\n47:08.880 --> 47:11.400\n But in boxing, there is like that extra pressure\n\n47:11.400 --> 47:13.520\n of like maintaining the championship.\n\n47:13.520 --> 47:14.920\n I mean, maybe you could say the same thing\n\n47:14.920 --> 47:17.200\n about the UFC as well.\n\n47:17.200 --> 47:22.040\n So for you personally, for a person who loves chess,\n\n47:22.040 --> 47:23.760\n the first time you won the World Championship,\n\n47:23.760 --> 47:28.160\n that was the big, that was the thing that was fun.\n\n47:28.160 --> 47:29.000\n Yeah.\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:32.160\n And then everything after is like stressful.\n\n47:32.160 --> 47:33.760\n Yeah.\n\n47:33.760 --> 47:34.800\n Essentially.\n\n47:34.800 --> 47:38.320\n There was certainly stress involved the first time as well.\n\n47:39.480 --> 47:44.480\n But it was nothing compared to the others.\n\n47:44.760 --> 47:46.920\n So the only World Championship after that\n\n47:46.920 --> 47:49.640\n that I really enjoyed was the one in 2018\n\n47:49.640 --> 47:51.800\n against the American Fabiano Caruana.\n\n47:51.800 --> 47:53.600\n And what that made that different\n\n47:53.600 --> 47:57.160\n is that I'd been kind of slumping for a bit\n\n47:57.160 --> 47:58.760\n and he'd been on the rise.\n\n47:58.760 --> 48:01.720\n So our ratings were very, very similar.\n\n48:01.720 --> 48:06.560\n They were so close that if at any point during the match\n\n48:06.560 --> 48:07.680\n I'd lost the game,\n\n48:09.920 --> 48:12.400\n he would have been ranked as number one in the world.\n\n48:12.400 --> 48:15.120\n Like our ratings were so close that for each draw,\n\n48:15.120 --> 48:16.680\n they didn't move.\n\n48:16.680 --> 48:17.520\n And.\n\n48:17.520 --> 48:18.800\n And the game itself was close.\n\n48:18.800 --> 48:21.720\n Yeah, the games themselves were very close.\n\n48:21.720 --> 48:26.600\n I had a winning position in the first game\n\n48:26.600 --> 48:28.880\n that I couldn't really get anywhere for a lot of games.\n\n48:28.880 --> 48:31.200\n Then he had a couple of games\n\n48:31.200 --> 48:34.080\n where he could potentially have won.\n\n48:34.080 --> 48:37.040\n Then in the last game I was a little bit better.\n\n48:37.040 --> 48:40.520\n And eventually they were all drawn.\n\n48:40.520 --> 48:41.960\n But I felt like all the way\n\n48:41.960 --> 48:45.000\n that this is an interesting match against an opponent\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:49.720\n who is at this position at this point equal to me.\n\n48:49.720 --> 48:53.640\n And so losing that would not have been this disaster.\n\n48:53.640 --> 48:55.440\n Because in all the other matches,\n\n48:55.440 --> 48:59.240\n I would know that I would have lost against somebody\n\n48:59.240 --> 49:02.280\n who I know I'm much better than.\n\n49:02.280 --> 49:07.280\n And that would be a lot harder for me to take.\n\n49:07.400 --> 49:09.040\n Well, that's fascinating and beautiful\n\n49:09.040 --> 49:11.320\n that the stress isn't from losing.\n\n49:12.440 --> 49:14.440\n Because you have fun.\n\n49:14.440 --> 49:17.280\n You enjoy playing against somebody who's as good as you,\n\n49:17.280 --> 49:18.760\n maybe better than you.\n\n49:18.760 --> 49:20.200\n That's exciting to you.\n\n49:20.200 --> 49:21.040\n Yeah.\n\n49:21.040 --> 49:24.400\n It's losing at this high stakes thing\n\n49:24.400 --> 49:27.400\n that only happens rarely to a person\n\n49:27.400 --> 49:28.640\n who's not as good as you.\n\n49:28.640 --> 49:31.760\n Yeah, and that's why it's also been incredibly frustrating\n\n49:31.760 --> 49:34.480\n in other matches, like when I know,\n\n49:34.480 --> 49:36.840\n when we play draw after draw.\n\n49:36.840 --> 49:39.560\n And I can just, I know that I'm better.\n\n49:39.560 --> 49:41.520\n I can sense during the game\n\n49:41.520 --> 49:43.320\n that I understand it better than them.\n\n49:43.320 --> 49:46.200\n But I cannot get over the hump.\n\n49:46.200 --> 49:51.120\n So you are the best chess player in the world.\n\n49:51.120 --> 49:53.600\n And you not playing the World Championship\n\n49:53.600 --> 49:58.120\n really makes the World Championship not seem important.\n\n49:58.120 --> 50:01.400\n Or I mean, there's an argument to be made for that.\n\n50:01.400 --> 50:03.720\n Is there anything you would like to see\n\n50:03.720 --> 50:05.480\n if you had a change about the World Championship\n\n50:05.480 --> 50:07.080\n that would make it more fun for you?\n\n50:07.080 --> 50:09.200\n And better for the game of chess period\n\n50:09.200 --> 50:10.640\n for everybody involved?\n\n50:10.640 --> 50:14.400\n So I think 12 games or now 14 games\n\n50:14.400 --> 50:16.120\n that there is for the World Championship\n\n50:16.120 --> 50:20.160\n is a fairly, fairly low sample size.\n\n50:20.160 --> 50:23.120\n If you want to determine who the best player is,\n\n50:23.120 --> 50:26.480\n or at least the best player in that particular matchup,\n\n50:26.480 --> 50:27.760\n you need more games.\n\n50:27.760 --> 50:30.040\n And I think to some extent,\n\n50:31.800 --> 50:34.080\n if you're gonna have a World Champion\n\n50:34.080 --> 50:36.000\n and call them the best players,\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:37.280\n best player, you gotta make sure\n\n50:37.280 --> 50:39.720\n that the format increases the chance\n\n50:39.720 --> 50:41.920\n of finding the best player.\n\n50:41.920 --> 50:43.960\n So I think having more games,\n\n50:43.960 --> 50:45.880\n and if you're gonna have a lot more games,\n\n50:45.880 --> 50:50.240\n then you need to decrease the time control a bit,\n\n50:50.240 --> 50:54.120\n which in turn, I think is also a good thing\n\n50:54.120 --> 50:59.120\n because in very long time controls with deep preparation,\n\n50:59.840 --> 51:03.000\n you can sort of mask a lot of your deficiencies\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:05.640\n as a chess player\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:10.680\n because you have a lot of time to think and to defend.\n\n51:10.680 --> 51:14.440\n And also, yeah, you have deep preparation.\n\n51:14.440 --> 51:17.960\n So I think those would be, for me to play,\n\n51:17.960 --> 51:22.000\n those would be the main things,\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.760\n more games and less time.\n\n51:24.760 --> 51:26.720\n So you want to see more games\n\n51:26.720 --> 51:30.200\n and rules that emphasize pure chess?\n\n51:30.200 --> 51:35.200\n Yeah, but already less time emphasizes pure chess\n\n51:35.680 --> 51:40.480\n because defensive techniques are much harder\n\n51:40.480 --> 51:42.360\n to execute with a little time.\n\n51:42.360 --> 51:45.040\n What do you think, is there a sweet spot in terms of,\n\n51:45.040 --> 51:46.240\n are we talking about Blitz?\n\n51:46.240 --> 51:47.080\n Is it, how many minutes?\n\n51:47.080 --> 51:48.600\n I think Blitz is a bit too fast.\n\n51:49.560 --> 51:53.960\n To their credit, this was suggested by Fieda as well.\n\n51:53.960 --> 51:57.240\n For a start to have two games per day,\n\n51:57.240 --> 52:01.240\n and let's say you have 45 minutes a game\n\n52:01.240 --> 52:04.320\n plus 15 or 30 seconds per move,\n\n52:04.320 --> 52:07.440\n that means that each sessions will probably be about,\n\n52:07.440 --> 52:10.120\n or a little less than two hours.\n\n52:10.120 --> 52:11.880\n That would be a start.\n\n52:11.880 --> 52:14.880\n Also what we're playing in the tournament\n\n52:14.880 --> 52:17.520\n that I'm playing here in Miami,\n\n52:17.520 --> 52:20.400\n which is four games a day\n\n52:20.400 --> 52:24.360\n with 15 minutes plus 10 seconds per move,\n\n52:24.360 --> 52:27.280\n those four would be more interesting\n\n52:27.280 --> 52:29.720\n than the one there is now.\n\n52:29.720 --> 52:32.720\n And I understand that there are a lot of traditions.\n\n52:32.720 --> 52:35.040\n People don't want to change the World Championship.\n\n52:35.040 --> 52:36.240\n That's all fine.\n\n52:36.240 --> 52:40.320\n I just think that the World Championship\n\n52:40.320 --> 52:42.760\n should do a better job of trying to reflect\n\n52:42.760 --> 52:44.920\n who's the best overall chess player.\n\n52:46.280 --> 52:50.200\n So would you say like, if it's faster games,\n\n52:50.200 --> 52:52.040\n you'd probably be able to get a sample size\n\n52:52.040 --> 52:55.320\n of like over 20 games, 20, 30, 40.\n\n52:55.320 --> 52:56.800\n You think there's a number that's good\n\n52:56.800 --> 52:58.400\n over a long period of time?\n\n52:58.400 --> 53:00.280\n Well, I would prefer as many as possible.\n\n53:00.280 --> 53:01.200\n So like a hundred?\n\n53:02.520 --> 53:07.400\n Yeah, but let's say you play 12 days, two games a day.\n\n53:07.400 --> 53:09.120\n You know, that's 24.\n\n53:09.120 --> 53:11.480\n I feel like that's already quite a bit better.\n\n53:11.480 --> 53:15.920\n You play like one black game, one white game each day.\n\n53:15.920 --> 53:17.360\n Endurance wise, that's okay?\n\n53:17.360 --> 53:18.240\n Yeah, I think that's fine.\n\n53:18.240 --> 53:19.680\n Like you will have free days as well.\n\n53:19.680 --> 53:22.320\n So I don't think that will be a problem.\n\n53:23.480 --> 53:26.320\n And also you have to prepare two sets of openings\n\n53:26.320 --> 53:29.120\n for each day, which makes it more difficult\n\n53:29.120 --> 53:32.560\n for the teams preparing, which I think is also good.\n\n53:32.560 --> 53:34.480\n Let me ask you a fun question.\n\n53:34.480 --> 53:39.480\n If Hikaru Nakamura was one of the two people,\n\n53:39.840 --> 53:41.480\n I guess, I apologize.\n\n53:41.480 --> 53:43.760\n Yeah, he could have finished second.\n\n53:43.760 --> 53:45.760\n So he lost the last round of the candidates.\n\n53:45.760 --> 53:48.440\n Yeah, and maybe you can explain to me,\n\n53:48.440 --> 53:51.920\n internet speed copium is something you tweeted.\n\n53:51.920 --> 53:53.000\n Yeah.\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:58.000\n But if he got second, would you just despite him\n\n53:59.040 --> 54:01.200\n still play the world championship?\n\n54:01.200 --> 54:02.680\n That's internet question.\n\n54:02.680 --> 54:04.960\n And when the internet asks, I must abide.\n\n54:04.960 --> 54:06.440\n The dude abides.\n\n54:06.440 --> 54:07.600\n Yeah, sure.\n\n54:07.600 --> 54:08.600\n Thank you, internet.\n\n54:10.920 --> 54:15.040\n So after the last match, I did an interview\n\n54:17.160 --> 54:20.120\n right after where I talked about the fact\n\n54:20.120 --> 54:22.360\n that I was unlikely to play the next one.\n\n54:22.360 --> 54:26.680\n I'd spoken privately to both family, friends,\n\n54:26.680 --> 54:29.080\n and of course also my chess team\n\n54:29.080 --> 54:33.840\n that this was likely going to be the last match.\n\n54:34.960 --> 54:38.160\n What happened was that right before\n\n54:38.160 --> 54:39.320\n the world championship match,\n\n54:39.320 --> 54:42.240\n there was this young player, Alireza Firouzsa.\n\n54:42.240 --> 54:43.560\n He had a dramatic rise.\n\n54:43.560 --> 54:46.120\n He rose to second in the world rankings.\n\n54:46.120 --> 54:48.920\n He was 18 then, he's 19 now.\n\n54:48.920 --> 54:50.920\n He qualified for the candidates.\n\n54:50.920 --> 54:53.040\n And it felt like there was like at least\n\n54:53.040 --> 54:59.360\n a half realistic possibility that he could be the challenger\n\n54:59.360 --> 55:01.520\n for the next world championship.\n\n55:01.520 --> 55:04.520\n And that sort of lit a fire under me.\n\n55:04.520 --> 55:05.360\n Do you like that idea?\n\n55:05.360 --> 55:07.440\n Yeah, I like that a lot.\n\n55:07.440 --> 55:11.800\n I love the idea of playing him in the next world championship.\n\n55:11.800 --> 55:16.640\n And originally, I was sure that I wanted to announce\n\n55:16.640 --> 55:19.080\n right after the tournament, the match,\n\n55:19.080 --> 55:20.720\n that this was it, I'm done.\n\n55:20.720 --> 55:22.600\n I'm not playing the next one.\n\n55:22.600 --> 55:24.120\n But this lit a fire under me.\n\n55:24.120 --> 55:29.720\n So that made me think, this actually motivates me.\n\n55:29.720 --> 55:33.120\n And I just wanted to get it out there for several reasons\n\n55:33.120 --> 55:36.680\n to create more hype about the candidates,\n\n55:36.680 --> 55:40.240\n to sort of motivate myself a little bit,\n\n55:40.240 --> 55:42.320\n maybe motivate him.\n\n55:42.320 --> 55:45.840\n Also, obviously I wanted to give people a heads up\n\n55:45.840 --> 55:49.600\n for the candidates that you might be playing\n\n55:49.600 --> 55:53.360\n for more than first place.\n\n55:53.360 --> 55:56.280\n Normally, the candidates is first place or best.\n\n55:56.280 --> 55:59.160\n It's like the world championship.\n\n55:59.160 --> 56:02.360\n And then, so Nakamura was one of many people\n\n56:02.360 --> 56:05.520\n who just didn't believe me, which is fair.\n\n56:05.520 --> 56:10.120\n Because I've talked before about not necessarily wanting\n\n56:10.120 --> 56:11.960\n to defend again.\n\n56:11.960 --> 56:16.880\n But I never talked as concretely or was as serious as this time.\n\n56:16.880 --> 56:19.000\n So he simply didn't believe me.\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.200\n And he was very vocal about that.\n\n56:21.200 --> 56:24.400\n And he said, nobody believed me, no other players,\n\n56:24.400 --> 56:27.120\n which may or may not have been true.\n\n56:27.120 --> 56:29.240\n And then, yeah, he lost the last game.\n\n56:29.240 --> 56:31.720\n And he didn't qualify.\n\n56:31.720 --> 56:35.520\n But to answer the question, no, I'd already at that point\n\n56:35.520 --> 56:38.160\n decided that I wouldn't play.\n\n56:38.160 --> 56:44.400\n I would have liked it less if he had not lost the last round.\n\n56:44.400 --> 56:48.680\n But the decision was already made.\n\n56:48.680 --> 56:51.200\n Does it break your heart a little bit\n\n56:51.200 --> 56:54.440\n that you're walking away from it?\n\n56:54.440 --> 56:55.920\n In all the ways that you mentioned\n\n56:55.920 --> 56:59.000\n that it's just not fun, there's a bunch of ways\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:02.000\n that it doesn't seem to bring out the best kind of chess.\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:03.920\n It doesn't bring out the best out of you\n\n57:03.920 --> 57:05.720\n in the particular opponents involved.\n\n57:05.720 --> 57:07.440\n Does it just break your heart a little bit?\n\n57:07.440 --> 57:10.880\n Like you're walking away from something,\n\n57:10.880 --> 57:12.440\n or maybe the entire chess community\n\n57:12.440 --> 57:17.320\n is walking away from a kind of a historic event that\n\n57:17.320 --> 57:20.960\n was so important in the 20th century at least?\n\n57:20.960 --> 57:23.840\n So I won the championship in 2013.\n\n57:23.840 --> 57:28.520\n I said no to the candidates in 2011.\n\n57:28.520 --> 57:30.720\n I didn't particularly like the format.\n\n57:30.720 --> 57:34.040\n I also wasn't, I was just not in the mood.\n\n57:34.040 --> 57:39.520\n I didn't want the pressure that was connected with the World\n\n57:39.520 --> 57:40.120\n Championship.\n\n57:40.120 --> 57:42.960\n And I was perfectly content at the time\n\n57:42.960 --> 57:46.320\n to play the tournaments that I did play,\n\n57:46.320 --> 57:48.840\n also to be ranked number one in the world.\n\n57:48.840 --> 57:52.880\n I was comfortable with the fact that I knew that I was the best\n\n57:52.880 --> 57:56.960\n and I didn't need a title to show others.\n\n57:56.960 --> 58:02.080\n And what happened later is I suddenly decided to play.\n\n58:02.080 --> 58:05.240\n In 2013, they changed the format.\n\n58:05.240 --> 58:08.280\n I liked it better.\n\n58:08.280 --> 58:11.080\n I just decided, it could be interesting.\n\n58:11.080 --> 58:13.680\n Let's try and get this.\n\n58:13.680 --> 58:17.280\n There really wasn't more than that to it.\n\n58:17.280 --> 58:21.840\n It wasn't like fulfilling lifelong dream or anything.\n\n58:21.840 --> 58:25.160\n I just thought, let's play.\n\n58:25.160 --> 58:27.160\n So it's just a cool tournament, a good challenge.\n\n58:27.160 --> 58:30.400\n Yeah, it's a cool tournament, it's a good challenge.\n\n58:30.400 --> 58:31.160\n Why not?\n\n58:31.160 --> 58:35.040\n It's something that could be a motivation.\n\n58:35.040 --> 58:39.120\n It motivated me to get in the best shape of my life\n\n58:39.120 --> 58:40.520\n that I had been until then.\n\n58:40.520 --> 58:42.280\n So it was a good thing.\n\n58:42.280 --> 58:46.640\n And 2013 match brought me a lot of joy as well.\n\n58:46.640 --> 58:49.400\n So I'm very, very happy that I did that.\n\n58:49.400 --> 58:50.960\n But I never had any thoughts that I'm\n\n58:50.960 --> 58:54.280\n going to keep the title for a long time.\n\n58:54.280 --> 58:58.800\n Immediately after the match in 2013,\n\n58:58.800 --> 59:01.920\n also before the match, I'd spoken against the fact\n\n59:01.920 --> 59:04.440\n that the champion is seeded into the final, which\n\n59:04.440 --> 59:07.320\n I thought was unfair.\n\n59:07.320 --> 59:10.600\n After the match, I made a proposal\n\n59:10.600 --> 59:13.800\n that we have a different system where the champion doesn't\n\n59:13.800 --> 59:14.880\n have these privileges.\n\n59:14.880 --> 59:19.080\n And people's reaction, both players and chess community,\n\n59:19.080 --> 59:22.120\n was generally like, OK, we're good.\n\n59:22.120 --> 59:23.960\n We don't want that.\n\n59:23.960 --> 59:26.080\n You keep your privileges.\n\n59:26.080 --> 59:27.920\n And I was like, OK, whatever.\n\n59:27.920 --> 59:30.080\n So you want to fight for it every time?\n\n59:30.080 --> 59:34.480\n Yeah, I want that.\n\n59:34.480 --> 59:37.360\n I have to ask, just in case you have an opinion,\n\n59:37.360 --> 59:41.000\n if you can maybe from a fantasy chess perspective\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:45.520\n analyze Ding versus Nepo, who wins?\n\n59:45.520 --> 59:48.080\n The current, the two people that would\n\n59:48.080 --> 59:50.520\n play if you're not playing.\n\n59:50.520 --> 59:54.600\n Generally, I would consider that Ding has a slightly better\n\n59:54.600 --> 59:57.160\n overall chess strength.\n\n59:57.160 --> 59:59.360\n What are the strengths and weaknesses of each,\n\n59:59.360 --> 1:00:02.440\n if you can summarize it?\n\n1:00:02.440 --> 1:00:08.720\n So Nepo, he's even better at calculating short lines\n\n1:00:08.720 --> 1:00:11.080\n than I am.\n\n1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:16.520\n But he can sometimes lack a little bit of depth.\n\n1:00:16.520 --> 1:00:19.920\n In short lines, he's an absolute calculation monster.\n\n1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:22.880\n He's extremely quick.\n\n1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:25.080\n But he can sometimes lack a bit of depth.\n\n1:00:25.080 --> 1:00:28.800\n Also recently, he's improved his openings quite a bit.\n\n1:00:28.800 --> 1:00:33.520\n So now he has a lot of good ideas.\n\n1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:36.880\n And he's very, very solid.\n\n1:00:36.880 --> 1:00:39.720\n Ding is not quite as well prepared.\n\n1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:42.560\n But he has an excellent understanding\n\n1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:48.920\n of dynamics and imbalances in chess, I would say.\n\n1:00:48.920 --> 1:00:51.440\n What do you mean by imbalances?\n\n1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:54.360\n Imbalances like bishops against knights\n\n1:00:54.360 --> 1:00:55.800\n and material imbalances.\n\n1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:57.600\n He can take advantage of those.\n\n1:00:57.600 --> 1:01:00.440\n Yes, I would say he's very, very good at that\n\n1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:04.360\n and understanding the dynamic factors,\n\n1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:10.440\n as we call them, like material versus time, especially.\n\n1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:12.920\n I think Nepo got the better of him and the candidates.\n\n1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:14.800\n So what's your sense why Ding has\n\n1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:17.080\n an edge in the championship?\n\n1:01:17.080 --> 1:01:21.320\n I feel like individual past results hasn't necessarily\n\n1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:25.960\n been a great indicator of world championship results.\n\n1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:32.000\n I feel like overall chess strength is more important.\n\n1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.840\n To be fair, I only think Ding has a very small edge.\n\n1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:36.680\n Difference is not big at all.\n\n1:01:36.680 --> 1:01:39.960\n But our individual head to head record\n\n1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:42.720\n was probably the main reason that a lot of people\n\n1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:45.680\n thought Nepo had a good chance against me as well.\n\n1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:51.560\n It was like 4 to 1 in his favor before the match.\n\n1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:53.320\n But that was just another example\n\n1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:56.640\n of why that may not necessarily mean anything.\n\n1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:00.360\n Also in our case, it was a very, very low sample size,\n\n1:02:00.360 --> 1:02:05.600\n I think, about the size of the match in total, 14 games.\n\n1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:09.200\n And that generally doesn't mean much.\n\n1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:11.920\n How close were those games, would you say, in your mind\n\n1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:14.040\n for the previous championship?\n\n1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:18.440\n So that game six was a turning point where you won.\n\n1:02:18.440 --> 1:02:21.480\n Was there any doubt in your mind that if you\n\n1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:24.000\n do a much larger sample size that you'll\n\n1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:25.360\n get the better of Nepo?\n\n1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:28.520\n No, no, larger sample size is always good for me.\n\n1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:33.600\n So world championship, it's a great parallel to football\n\n1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:36.440\n because it's a low scoring game.\n\n1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:41.320\n And if the better player or the better team scores,\n\n1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:44.160\n they win most of the time.\n\n1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:47.280\n Oh, that's generally for championships or in general?\n\n1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:48.960\n Yeah, for championships.\n\n1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:54.040\n They generally, generally win because the other slightly\n\n1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:57.120\n weaker team, they're good enough to defend\n\n1:02:57.120 --> 1:03:00.000\n to make it very, very difficult for the others.\n\n1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.760\n But when they actually have to create the chances,\n\n1:03:02.760 --> 1:03:04.040\n then they have no chance.\n\n1:03:04.040 --> 1:03:06.640\n And then it very often ends with a blowout\n\n1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:08.920\n as it did in our match.\n\n1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:11.280\n If I hadn't won game six, it probably\n\n1:03:11.280 --> 1:03:13.160\n would have been very, very close.\n\n1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:14.760\n He might have edged it.\n\n1:03:14.760 --> 1:03:16.200\n There's obviously a bigger chance\n\n1:03:16.200 --> 1:03:18.280\n that I would have edged it.\n\n1:03:18.280 --> 1:03:21.240\n But this is just what happens a lot in chess,\n\n1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:24.080\n but also in football that matches are close\n\n1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:27.800\n and then they somebody scores, somebody scores\n\n1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:30.000\n and then things change.\n\n1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.640\n And this gives people the illusion\n\n1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:35.960\n that the matchup was very close.\n\n1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:40.240\n Well, actually, it just means that the nature of the game\n\n1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:43.760\n makes the matches close very often.\n\n1:03:43.760 --> 1:03:47.560\n But it's always much more likely that one of the teams\n\n1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:49.120\n is going to or one of the players\n\n1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:51.480\n is going to break away than the others.\n\n1:03:51.480 --> 1:03:56.080\n And in other matches as well, even though a lot of people\n\n1:03:56.080 --> 1:04:01.440\n before the match in 2016 against Karjakin,\n\n1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:04.320\n there were people who thought before the match\n\n1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:07.600\n that I was massively overrated as a favorite\n\n1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:12.920\n and that essentially the match was pretty, pretty close,\n\n1:04:12.920 --> 1:04:18.920\n like whatever, 60, 40, or some people even said like 55, 45.\n\n1:04:18.920 --> 1:04:23.120\n And what I felt was that the match went very, very wrong\n\n1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:25.880\n for me and I still won.\n\n1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:28.200\n And some people saw that as an indication\n\n1:04:28.200 --> 1:04:30.240\n that the pre match probabilities were probably\n\n1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:31.640\n a bit closer than people thought.\n\n1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:35.760\n Well, I would look at it in the way that everything went wrong\n\n1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:38.600\n and I still won, which probably means\n\n1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:41.000\n that I was a pretty big favorite to begin with.\n\n1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.800\n I do have a question to you about that match, but first,\n\n1:04:43.800 --> 1:04:46.880\n so Sergei Karjakin was originally a qualifier\n\n1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:50.160\n for the candidate tournament, but was disqualified\n\n1:04:50.160 --> 1:04:52.400\n for breaching the FIDE code of ethics\n\n1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:54.120\n after publicly expressing approval\n\n1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:57.880\n for the 2022 Russian invasion in Ukraine.\n\n1:04:57.880 --> 1:05:00.400\n You look at the Cold War and some of the US\n\n1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:02.480\n versus Russian games of the past,\n\n1:05:02.480 --> 1:05:05.880\n does politics, does some of this geopolitics,\n\n1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:09.360\n politics ever creep its way into the game?\n\n1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:11.520\n Do you feel the pressure, the immensity of that\n\n1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:13.600\n as it does sometimes for the Olympics,\n\n1:05:13.600 --> 1:05:15.640\n these big nations playing each other,\n\n1:05:15.640 --> 1:05:17.120\n competing against each other,\n\n1:05:17.120 --> 1:05:22.120\n almost like fighting out in a friendly way,\n\n1:05:22.200 --> 1:05:23.880\n the battles, the tensions that they have\n\n1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:26.080\n in the space of geopolitics?\n\n1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:27.640\n Yeah, I think it still does.\n\n1:05:27.640 --> 1:05:30.920\n So the president of the World Chess Federation\n\n1:05:30.920 --> 1:05:33.920\n who was just reelected is a Russian.\n\n1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:36.840\n Like I like him personally, for sure,\n\n1:05:36.840 --> 1:05:39.640\n but he is quite connected to the Kremlin.\n\n1:05:39.640 --> 1:05:42.920\n And it's quite clear that the Kremlin\n\n1:05:42.920 --> 1:05:45.640\n considers it at least a semi important goal\n\n1:05:45.640 --> 1:05:49.360\n to bring the chess crown home to Russia.\n\n1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:52.960\n So it's still definitely a factor.\n\n1:05:52.960 --> 1:05:56.720\n And I mean, I can answer for in the Karjakin case,\n\n1:05:56.720 --> 1:06:00.120\n like I don't have a strong opinion\n\n1:06:00.120 --> 1:06:03.920\n on whether he should have been banned or not.\n\n1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:05.800\n Obviously, I don't agree with anything\n\n1:06:05.800 --> 1:06:08.480\n that he says.\n\n1:06:08.480 --> 1:06:13.480\n But in principle, I think that you should ban\n\n1:06:14.400 --> 1:06:17.000\n either no Russians or all Russians.\n\n1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:22.000\n I'm generally not particularly against either,\n\n1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:27.480\n but I don't love banning wrong opinions,\n\n1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:32.480\n even if they are as reprehensible as his have been.\n\n1:06:32.480 --> 1:06:36.440\n Yeah, there's something about the World Chess Championships\n\n1:06:36.440 --> 1:06:39.440\n or the Olympics where it feels like banning\n\n1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:41.520\n is counterproductive to the alleviating\n\n1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:43.040\n some of the conflicts.\n\n1:06:43.040 --> 1:06:43.880\n We don't know.\n\n1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:45.200\n This is the thing though.\n\n1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:48.920\n We really don't know about the long term conflicts.\n\n1:06:48.920 --> 1:06:53.280\n And a lot of people try to do the right thing in this sense,\n\n1:06:53.280 --> 1:06:54.800\n which I don't really blame at all.\n\n1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:57.760\n It's just that we don't know.\n\n1:06:57.760 --> 1:07:00.880\n And I guess sometimes there are other ways\n\n1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:04.120\n you wanna try and help as well.\n\n1:07:04.120 --> 1:07:05.920\n See, like within the competition,\n\n1:07:05.920 --> 1:07:08.440\n within some of those battles of US versus Russia\n\n1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:10.120\n or so on of the past,\n\n1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:12.760\n there's also between the individuals,\n\n1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:15.360\n maybe you'll disagree with this,\n\n1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:16.920\n but from a spectator perspective,\n\n1:07:16.920 --> 1:07:18.840\n there's still a camaraderie.\n\n1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:20.800\n Like at the end of the day,\n\n1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:22.360\n there's a thing that unites you,\n\n1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:25.320\n which is this like appreciation\n\n1:07:25.320 --> 1:07:27.320\n of the fight over the chessboard.\n\n1:07:29.280 --> 1:07:30.520\n Even if you hate each other.\n\n1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:31.560\n Yeah, for sure.\n\n1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:35.840\n I think for every match that's been,\n\n1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:37.680\n you would briefly discuss the game\n\n1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:40.200\n with your opponent after the game,\n\n1:07:40.200 --> 1:07:41.800\n no matter how much you hate each other.\n\n1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:43.960\n And I think that's lovely.\n\n1:07:43.960 --> 1:07:46.800\n And Kasparov, I mean, he was quoted,\n\n1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:48.880\n like when somebody in his team asked him like,\n\n1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:52.280\n why are you talking to Karpov after the game?\n\n1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:54.320\n Like you hate that guy.\n\n1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:55.280\n And he's like, yeah, sure.\n\n1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:57.560\n But he's the only one who understands me.\n\n1:07:57.560 --> 1:07:59.280\n Yeah, the only one who understands.\n\n1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:01.680\n So that's, no, I think that's really lovely.\n\n1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:06.280\n And I would love to see that in other areas as well,\n\n1:08:06.280 --> 1:08:09.320\n that you can, regardless of what happens,\n\n1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:12.120\n you can have a good chat about the game.\n\n1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:15.080\n You can just talk about the ideas\n\n1:08:15.080 --> 1:08:18.800\n with people who understand what you understand.\n\n1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:21.760\n So if you're not playing the world championships,\n\n1:08:21.760 --> 1:08:24.400\n there's a lot of people who are saying\n\n1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:27.720\n that perhaps the world championships don't matter anymore.\n\n1:08:27.720 --> 1:08:30.160\n Do you think there's some truth to that?\n\n1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:32.560\n I said that back a long time ago as well,\n\n1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:37.560\n that for me, I don't know if it never happened.\n\n1:08:37.840 --> 1:08:39.400\n So I don't know what would have happened,\n\n1:08:39.400 --> 1:08:43.000\n but I was thinking like the moment that I realized\n\n1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:44.480\n that I'm not the best player in the world,\n\n1:08:44.480 --> 1:08:47.440\n like I felt like morally I have to renounce\n\n1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:49.680\n the world championship title, you know,\n\n1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:51.440\n because it doesn't mean anything\n\n1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:53.560\n as long as you're not the best player.\n\n1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:58.560\n So the ratings really tell a bigger, a clearer story.\n\n1:08:58.920 --> 1:09:01.360\n I think so, at least over time.\n\n1:09:01.360 --> 1:09:05.080\n Like I'm a lot more proud of my streak\n\n1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:06.800\n of being rated number one in the world,\n\n1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:11.800\n which is now since I think the summer of 2011.\n\n1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:17.720\n I'm a lot more proud of that than the world championships.\n\n1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:21.520\n How much anxiety or even fear do you have\n\n1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:24.440\n before making a difficult decision on the chessboard?\n\n1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:26.680\n So it's a high stakes game.\n\n1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:28.840\n How nervous do you get?\n\n1:09:28.840 --> 1:09:31.000\n How much anxiety do you have in all that calculations?\n\n1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.640\n You're sitting there for 10, 15 minutes\n\n1:09:33.640 --> 1:09:35.080\n because you're in a fog.\n\n1:09:35.080 --> 1:09:38.080\n There's always a possibility of a blunder, of a mistake.\n\n1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:39.320\n Are you anxious about it?\n\n1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:40.880\n Are you afraid of it?\n\n1:09:40.880 --> 1:09:41.920\n Really depends.\n\n1:09:42.880 --> 1:09:45.880\n I have been at times.\n\n1:09:45.880 --> 1:09:50.520\n I think the most nervous I ever been was game 10\n\n1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:54.480\n of the world championships in 2018.\n\n1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:58.480\n I know that was just a thrilling game.\n\n1:09:58.480 --> 1:10:00.080\n I was black.\n\n1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:02.840\n I basically abandoned the queen side at some point\n\n1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:04.480\n to attack him on the king side.\n\n1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:08.920\n And I knew that my attack, if it doesn't work,\n\n1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:12.080\n I'm going to lose, but I had so much adrenaline.\n\n1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:13.360\n So that was fine.\n\n1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:14.920\n I thought I was going to win.\n\n1:10:14.920 --> 1:10:18.160\n Then at some point I realized that it's not so clear\n\n1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:20.840\n and that my time was ticking and I was just getting\n\n1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:21.960\n so nervous.\n\n1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:25.360\n I still remember what happened.\n\n1:10:25.360 --> 1:10:28.120\n Like we played this time trouble phase\n\n1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:31.520\n where he had very little time, but I had even less.\n\n1:10:31.520 --> 1:10:35.120\n And I just remember, I kind of remember much of it,\n\n1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:38.400\n just that when it was over, I was just so relieved\n\n1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:40.160\n because then it was clear that the position\n\n1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:43.520\n was probably gonna be routed in a draw.\n\n1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:47.360\n Otherwise I'm often nervous before games,\n\n1:10:47.360 --> 1:10:50.720\n but when I get there, it's all business.\n\n1:10:50.720 --> 1:10:53.760\n And especially when I'm playing well,\n\n1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:57.920\n I'm never afraid of losing when I play\n\n1:10:57.920 --> 1:11:01.120\n because I trust my instincts.\n\n1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:03.480\n I trust my skills.\n\n1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:06.120\n How much psychological intimidation is there\n\n1:11:06.120 --> 1:11:09.840\n from you to the other person, from the other person to you?\n\n1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:11.880\n I think people would play a lot better\n\n1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:15.080\n if they played against an anonymous me.\n\n1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:20.080\n I would love to have a tournament online\n\n1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:25.440\n where let's say you play 10 of the best players in the world\n\n1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:28.680\n and for each round you don't know who you're playing.\n\n1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:31.840\n That's an interesting question.\n\n1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:35.000\n There's these videos where people eat McDonald's\n\n1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:38.560\n or Burger King or Diet Coke versus Diet Pepsi.\n\n1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:41.120\n Would people be able to tell they're playing you\n\n1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:45.040\n from the style of play, do you think?\n\n1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:46.600\n Or from the strength of play?\n\n1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:51.240\n If there was a decent sample size, sure.\n\n1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:52.080\n And what about you?\n\n1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:55.200\n Would you be able to tell others?\n\n1:11:55.200 --> 1:11:58.160\n In just one game?\n\n1:11:58.160 --> 1:11:59.240\n Very unlikely.\n\n1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:02.200\n What sample size would you need to tell accurately?\n\n1:12:02.200 --> 1:12:03.600\n I feel like this is science.\n\n1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:06.720\n Yeah, I think 20 games would help a lot.\n\n1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:07.560\n Per person?\n\n1:12:07.560 --> 1:12:09.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:13.600\n But I know that they've already developed AI bots\n\n1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:16.960\n that are pretty good at recognizing somebody's style.\n\n1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:17.800\n Okay.\n\n1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:20.280\n Which is quite fascinating.\n\n1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:23.720\n And it'd be fascinating if those bots\n\n1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:26.000\n were able to summarize the style somehow.\n\n1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.440\n Maybe great attacking chess,\n\n1:12:28.440 --> 1:12:29.760\n like some of the same characteristics\n\n1:12:29.760 --> 1:12:33.600\n you've been describing like great at short line calculations\n\n1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:34.440\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:35.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:37.760\n Or did you just talk shit?\n\n1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:40.600\n No, but really all the best chess players,\n\n1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:42.200\n there are basically just two camps.\n\n1:12:42.200 --> 1:12:46.240\n People who are good at longer lines or shorter lines.\n\n1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:49.280\n It's the hare and the tortoise, basically.\n\n1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:51.800\n And sometimes, you know,\n\n1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:55.040\n I feel like I'm the closest you can get\n\n1:12:55.040 --> 1:12:57.800\n to a high bridge of those.\n\n1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:00.040\n Because you got both,\n\n1:13:00.040 --> 1:13:02.080\n you're good in every position.\n\n1:13:02.080 --> 1:13:03.600\n So the middle game and end game.\n\n1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:06.600\n Yeah, and also I can think to some extent\n\n1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:08.960\n both rapidly and deeply,\n\n1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:11.920\n which a lot of people, they can't do both.\n\n1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:14.320\n But I mean, to answer your question from before,\n\n1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:15.640\n I think, yeah,\n\n1:13:15.640 --> 1:13:18.120\n I sometimes can get a little bit intimidated\n\n1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:18.960\n by my opponent,\n\n1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:23.880\n but it's mostly if there's something unknown.\n\n1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:25.840\n It's mostly if it's something\n\n1:13:25.840 --> 1:13:28.400\n that I don't understand fully.\n\n1:13:28.400 --> 1:13:30.880\n And I do think, especially when I'm playing,\n\n1:13:30.880 --> 1:13:34.640\n well, people, they just play more timidly against me\n\n1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:36.040\n than they do against each other.\n\n1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:39.600\n Sometimes without even realizing it.\n\n1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:42.880\n And I certainly use that to my advantage.\n\n1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:46.360\n If I sense that my opponent is apprehensive,\n\n1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:49.720\n if I sense that they are not gonna necessarily\n\n1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:51.360\n take all their chances,\n\n1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:53.360\n it just means that I can take more risk.\n\n1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:58.360\n And I always try and find that balance.\n\n1:13:58.400 --> 1:13:59.680\n To shake them up a little bit.\n\n1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:00.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:03.200\n What's been the toughest loss of your career\n\n1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:04.320\n that you remember?\n\n1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:08.200\n Would that be the World Championship match?\n\n1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:09.880\n Oh yeah, for sure.\n\n1:14:09.880 --> 1:14:12.360\n Game eight in 2016.\n\n1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:13.400\n And who was it against?\n\n1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:16.440\n Against Karjakin in New York.\n\n1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:19.320\n Can you take it through the story of that game?\n\n1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:22.280\n Where were you before that game\n\n1:14:22.280 --> 1:14:24.480\n in terms of game one through seven?\n\n1:14:26.160 --> 1:14:29.160\n Yeah, so game one and two, not much happened.\n\n1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:32.720\n Game three and four, I was winning in both of them.\n\n1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:37.720\n And normally, I should definitely have converted both.\n\n1:14:37.720 --> 1:14:42.720\n I couldn't, partly due to good defense on his part,\n\n1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:47.480\n but mostly because I just, I messed up.\n\n1:14:48.280 --> 1:14:53.280\n And then after that, games five, six, and seven,\n\n1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:56.200\n not much happened.\n\n1:14:56.200 --> 1:15:00.080\n I was getting impatient at that point.\n\n1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:04.360\n So for game eight, I was probably ready\n\n1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:07.400\n to take a little bit more risks than I had\n\n1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:11.360\n before, which I guess was insane\n\n1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:14.480\n because I knew that he couldn't beat me\n\n1:15:14.480 --> 1:15:15.800\n unless I beat myself.\n\n1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:20.320\n Like he wasn't strong enough to outplay me.\n\n1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:22.400\n And that was leading to impatience somehow?\n\n1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:23.560\n And impatience.\n\n1:15:23.560 --> 1:15:25.960\n No, because I knew that I was better.\n\n1:15:25.960 --> 1:15:27.000\n I knew that I was better.\n\n1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:28.880\n I knew that I just needed to win one game\n\n1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:30.320\n and then the match is over.\n\n1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:32.680\n That's what happened in 2021 as well.\n\n1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:34.680\n Like when I won the first game against Nebo,\n\n1:15:34.680 --> 1:15:35.840\n I knew that the match was over\n\n1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:38.160\n unless I like fuck up royally,\n\n1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:42.240\n then he's not gonna be able to beat me.\n\n1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:44.920\n So what happened was that I played\n\n1:15:44.920 --> 1:15:47.160\n a kind of an innocuous opening as White,\n\n1:15:48.160 --> 1:15:49.400\n just trying to get a game,\n\n1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:51.920\n trying to get him out of book as soon as possible.\n\n1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:52.760\n Then...\n\n1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:53.600\n Okay, can you elaborate?\n\n1:15:53.600 --> 1:15:55.640\n Innocuous, get him out of the book.\n\n1:15:56.960 --> 1:16:00.040\n No, basically I set up pretty defensively as White.\n\n1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:04.360\n I wasn't really crossing into his half at the start at all.\n\n1:16:04.360 --> 1:16:07.200\n I was just, I played more like a system\n\n1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:09.920\n more than like a concrete opening.\n\n1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:12.480\n It was like, I'm gonna set up my pieces this way.\n\n1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:14.840\n You can set them up however you want.\n\n1:16:14.840 --> 1:16:18.240\n And then later where sort of the armies are gonna meet.\n\n1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:20.560\n I'm not gonna try and bother you at the start.\n\n1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:22.520\n And that means you're gonna have\n\n1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:24.000\n with as many pieces as possible\n\n1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:26.040\n kind of pure chess in the middle game\n\n1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:28.960\n without any of the lines,\n\n1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:31.080\n the standard lines in the opening.\n\n1:16:31.080 --> 1:16:32.160\n Exactly.\n\n1:16:32.160 --> 1:16:33.680\n And so there was at some point\n\n1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:34.720\n a couple of exchanges,\n\n1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:38.120\n then some maneuvering, a little bit better.\n\n1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:40.000\n Then he was sort of equalizing\n\n1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:42.280\n and then I started to take too many risks.\n\n1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:44.480\n And I was still sort of fine,\n\n1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:48.480\n but then at some point I realized\n\n1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:50.640\n that I'd gone a bit too far\n\n1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:52.280\n and I had to be really careful.\n\n1:16:52.280 --> 1:16:53.920\n Then I just froze.\n\n1:16:53.920 --> 1:16:56.120\n I just completely froze.\n\n1:16:57.120 --> 1:16:57.960\n Mentally?\n\n1:16:57.960 --> 1:16:58.800\n Yeah, mentally.\n\n1:16:58.800 --> 1:16:59.720\n What happened?\n\n1:16:59.720 --> 1:17:04.720\n I realized that all the thoughts of I might lose this.\n\n1:17:05.480 --> 1:17:07.360\n What have I done?\n\n1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:08.840\n Why did I take so many risks?\n\n1:17:08.840 --> 1:17:11.040\n I knew that I could have drawn at any moment.\n\n1:17:11.040 --> 1:17:12.560\n Just be patient.\n\n1:17:12.560 --> 1:17:15.600\n Don't give him these opportunities.\n\n1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:18.840\n What triggered that phase transition in your mind?\n\n1:17:18.840 --> 1:17:22.640\n No, it was just a position on the board.\n\n1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:25.200\n Realizing there was one particular move he played\n\n1:17:25.200 --> 1:17:26.040\n that I missed.\n\n1:17:26.040 --> 1:17:30.960\n And then I realized that this could potentially\n\n1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:32.400\n not go my way.\n\n1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:35.440\n So then I made another couple of mistakes\n\n1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:37.600\n and he, to his credit,\n\n1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:39.600\n once he realized he had the chance,\n\n1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:43.200\n he knew that this was his one chance.\n\n1:17:43.200 --> 1:17:44.960\n He had to take it.\n\n1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:46.720\n And so he did.\n\n1:17:46.720 --> 1:17:51.240\n And yeah, that's the worst I've ever felt\n\n1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:54.000\n after a chess game.\n\n1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:57.640\n I realized that I'm probably gonna lose my title\n\n1:17:57.640 --> 1:18:00.840\n against somebody who's not even close to my level.\n\n1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:07.040\n And I've done it because of my own stupidity, most of all.\n\n1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:12.720\n And that was really, really...\n\n1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:16.160\n At the time, I was all in my own head.\n\n1:18:16.160 --> 1:18:18.480\n That was hard to deal with.\n\n1:18:18.480 --> 1:18:22.440\n And I felt like I didn't really recover too much\n\n1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:24.400\n for the next game.\n\n1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:27.120\n So what I did, there was a free day after the eighth game.\n\n1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:30.040\n So I did something that I never did\n\n1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:31.480\n at any other world championship.\n\n1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:34.560\n Like after game eight, I just,\n\n1:18:35.720 --> 1:18:37.360\n I got drunk with my team.\n\n1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:39.720\n And...\n\n1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:40.720\n That's not a standard procedure.\n\n1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:41.920\n No, no.\n\n1:18:41.920 --> 1:18:43.840\n That's the only time that's happened\n\n1:18:43.840 --> 1:18:46.400\n in the world championship during the match.\n\n1:18:46.400 --> 1:18:50.000\n So yeah, I just tried to forget.\n\n1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.200\n But still before game nine...\n\n1:18:52.200 --> 1:18:54.400\n Game nine, I was a little bit more relaxed,\n\n1:18:55.480 --> 1:18:56.680\n but I was still a bit nervous.\n\n1:18:56.680 --> 1:18:59.760\n Then game nine, I almost lost as well.\n\n1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:02.080\n Then only game 10.\n\n1:19:02.080 --> 1:19:04.520\n Game 10, I was still, I wasn't in a great mood.\n\n1:19:04.520 --> 1:19:06.080\n I was really, really tense.\n\n1:19:07.240 --> 1:19:09.080\n The opening was good.\n\n1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:10.760\n I had some advantage.\n\n1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:11.920\n I was getting optimistic.\n\n1:19:11.920 --> 1:19:13.840\n Then I made one mistake.\n\n1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:15.280\n He could have forced a draw.\n\n1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:18.000\n And then all the negativity came back.\n\n1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.240\n Like, I was thinking during the game,\n\n1:19:20.240 --> 1:19:22.440\n like how am I going to play for a win with Black\n\n1:19:22.440 --> 1:19:23.280\n in the next game?\n\n1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:26.400\n Like, what am I doing?\n\n1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:29.720\n And then, you know, eventually it ended well.\n\n1:19:29.720 --> 1:19:32.880\n It didn't find the right line.\n\n1:19:32.880 --> 1:19:33.880\n I ground him down.\n\n1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:36.320\n Actually, I played at some point pretty well\n\n1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:37.200\n in the end game.\n\n1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:43.080\n And after that game, like there was such a weight.\n\n1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:44.120\n Lifted? Lifted.\n\n1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:47.640\n No, after that, there was like no thought\n\n1:19:47.640 --> 1:19:49.280\n of losing the match whatsoever.\n\n1:19:49.280 --> 1:19:53.920\n I knew that, okay, I'd basically gotten away with,\n\n1:19:54.840 --> 1:19:59.120\n not with murder, but gotten away with something.\n\n1:19:59.120 --> 1:20:02.920\n What can you say about the after game eight?\n\n1:20:02.920 --> 1:20:05.720\n Where are the places you've gone in your mind?\n\n1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:07.440\n Do you go to some dark places?\n\n1:20:07.440 --> 1:20:09.160\n We're talking about like depression.\n\n1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:11.360\n Do you think about quitting at that point?\n\n1:20:12.440 --> 1:20:14.720\n No, I mean, I think about quitting\n\n1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:17.080\n every time I lose a classical game.\n\n1:20:17.080 --> 1:20:18.680\n Or at least I used to.\n\n1:20:18.680 --> 1:20:21.320\n Like, especially if it's in a stupid way,\n\n1:20:21.320 --> 1:20:25.200\n I'm thinking like, okay, if I'm gonna play like this,\n\n1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:27.880\n if I'm gonna do things that I know are wrong,\n\n1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:30.160\n then, you know, I might as well quit.\n\n1:20:30.160 --> 1:20:34.040\n No, that's happened a bunch of times.\n\n1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:37.400\n And I've definitely gotten a bit more carefree\n\n1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:38.840\n about losing these days,\n\n1:20:38.840 --> 1:20:41.000\n which it's not necessarily a good thing.\n\n1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:46.000\n Like my hatred of losing led to me not losing a lot.\n\n1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:49.400\n Losing a lot and it also lit the fire under me\n\n1:20:49.400 --> 1:20:52.560\n that I think my performance after losses\n\n1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:56.040\n in classical chess over the last 10 years\n\n1:20:56.040 --> 1:20:58.040\n is like over 2,900.\n\n1:20:58.040 --> 1:21:01.440\n Like I really play well after a loss,\n\n1:21:01.440 --> 1:21:03.320\n even though it's really, really unpleasant.\n\n1:21:03.320 --> 1:21:07.960\n So apparently like I don't think the way\n\n1:21:07.960 --> 1:21:09.920\n that I dealt with them is particularly healthy,\n\n1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:11.600\n but it's worked.\n\n1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:12.800\n It's worked so far.\n\n1:21:12.800 --> 1:21:15.760\n But then you've discovered now a love for winning\n\n1:21:15.760 --> 1:21:20.360\n to where ultimately longevity wise creates more fun.\n\n1:21:20.360 --> 1:21:21.200\n Yeah, for sure.\n\n1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:26.200\n What's the perfect day in the life of Magnus Carlsen\n\n1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:28.680\n on a day of a big chess match?\n\n1:21:28.680 --> 1:21:30.360\n It doesn't have to be world championship,\n\n1:21:30.360 --> 1:21:33.720\n but if it's a chess match you care about,\n\n1:21:33.720 --> 1:21:35.840\n what time do you wake up?\n\n1:21:35.840 --> 1:21:37.240\n What do you eat?\n\n1:21:37.240 --> 1:21:38.920\n Oh, it depends on when the game is,\n\n1:21:38.920 --> 1:21:42.600\n but let's say the game is at three,\n\n1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:47.600\n I'll probably wake up pretty late at about 11.\n\n1:21:49.440 --> 1:21:54.440\n Then I'll go for a walk,\n\n1:21:55.120 --> 1:21:57.560\n might listen to some podcasts.\n\n1:21:57.560 --> 1:22:00.160\n Maybe I'll spend a little bit of time\n\n1:22:00.160 --> 1:22:04.160\n looking at some NBA game from last night or whatever.\n\n1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:05.480\n So not chess related stuff?\n\n1:22:05.480 --> 1:22:06.920\n No, no, no, no.\n\n1:22:06.920 --> 1:22:11.240\n Then I'll get back, I'll have a big lunch,\n\n1:22:11.240 --> 1:22:13.040\n like usually like a big omelet\n\n1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:15.440\n with a bunch of salad and stuff.\n\n1:22:15.440 --> 1:22:20.440\n Then go to the game, win like a very nice clean game.\n\n1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:22.280\n Perfect day.\n\n1:22:22.280 --> 1:22:24.920\n Just go back after, relax.\n\n1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:28.800\n Like the things that make me the happiest at tournaments\n\n1:22:28.800 --> 1:22:33.560\n is just having a good routine and feeling well.\n\n1:22:33.560 --> 1:22:36.840\n I don't like it when too much is happening around me.\n\n1:22:36.840 --> 1:22:41.480\n So the tournament that I came from now was\n\n1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:44.040\n the Chess Olympiad, which is the team event.\n\n1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:46.280\n So we were a team Norway.\n\n1:22:46.280 --> 1:22:47.600\n We did horribly.\n\n1:22:49.040 --> 1:22:52.200\n I did okay, but the team in general did horribly.\n\n1:22:52.200 --> 1:22:54.320\n You won that Italy?\n\n1:22:54.320 --> 1:22:58.320\n No, no, Italy beat us, but Uzbekistan won in the end.\n\n1:22:58.320 --> 1:23:01.000\n They were this amazing team of young players.\n\n1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:02.920\n It was really impressive.\n\n1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:05.560\n But the thing is like we had a good comradery in the team.\n\n1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:07.320\n We had our meals together.\n\n1:23:07.320 --> 1:23:10.200\n We played a bit of football, went swimming,\n\n1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:13.320\n and I couldn't understand why things went wrong.\n\n1:23:13.320 --> 1:23:14.360\n And I still don't understand.\n\n1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:17.160\n But the thing is for me, it was all very nice,\n\n1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:19.840\n but now I'm so happy to be on my own at a tournament\n\n1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:24.080\n just to have my own routines, not see too many people.\n\n1:23:24.080 --> 1:23:27.520\n Otherwise just have like a very small team of people\n\n1:23:27.520 --> 1:23:28.400\n that I see.\n\n1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:31.000\n You are a kind of celebrity now.\n\n1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:35.600\n So people within the chess tournament and outside\n\n1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:37.640\n would recognize you, want to socialize,\n\n1:23:37.640 --> 1:23:39.600\n want to tell you about how much you mean to them,\n\n1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:41.800\n how much you inspire them, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:23:41.800 --> 1:23:43.920\n Does that get in the way for you\n\n1:23:43.920 --> 1:23:46.840\n when you're like trying to really focus on the match?\n\n1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:49.120\n Are you able to block that?\n\n1:23:49.120 --> 1:23:51.920\n Like are you able to enjoy those little interactions\n\n1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:53.400\n and still keep your focus?\n\n1:23:53.400 --> 1:23:56.120\n Yeah, most of the time that's fine\n\n1:23:56.120 --> 1:23:57.680\n as long as it's not too much.\n\n1:23:57.680 --> 1:24:01.080\n But I have to admit, when I'm at home in Norway,\n\n1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:07.000\n I rarely go out without big headphones and something.\n\n1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:11.960\n Oh, like a disguise?\n\n1:24:11.960 --> 1:24:15.240\n No, not a disguise, just to block out the world.\n\n1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:16.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:17.560\n Otherwise...\n\n1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:18.720\n Don't make eye contact?\n\n1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:23.360\n Yeah, no, so the thing is people in general are nice.\n\n1:24:23.360 --> 1:24:25.960\n I mean, people, they wish me well,\n\n1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:29.440\n and they don't bother me.\n\n1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:31.680\n Also, when I have the headphones on,\n\n1:24:31.680 --> 1:24:35.440\n I don't notice as much people turning around and all of that\n\n1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:38.680\n so I can be more of in my own world.\n\n1:24:39.920 --> 1:24:40.840\n So I like that.\n\n1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:45.800\n Yeah, what about in this perfect day after the game?\n\n1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:47.520\n Do you try to analyze what happened?\n\n1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:49.800\n Do you try to think through systematically\n\n1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:52.200\n or do you just kind of loosely think about like...\n\n1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:53.680\n No, I just loosely think about it.\n\n1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:56.840\n I've never been very structured in that sense.\n\n1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:00.240\n I know that it was always recommended\n\n1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:03.040\n that you analyze your own games,\n\n1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:06.880\n but I generally felt that I mostly had a good idea\n\n1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:07.720\n about that.\n\n1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:12.720\n Like nowadays, I will loosely see what the engine says\n\n1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:15.400\n at a certain point if I'm curious about that.\n\n1:25:15.400 --> 1:25:18.640\n Otherwise, I usually move on to the next.\n\n1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:21.320\n What about diet?\n\n1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:23.160\n You said omelet and salad and so on.\n\n1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:26.920\n I heard in your conversation with the other Magnus,\n\n1:25:26.920 --> 1:25:31.920\n Magnus number two, about you had like this bet about meat.\n\n1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:34.000\n One of you are gonna go vegan if you lose,\n\n1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:34.840\n I forget which bet.\n\n1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:36.160\n Vegetarian though.\n\n1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:37.480\n Vegetarian, sorry.\n\n1:25:37.480 --> 1:25:40.280\n And you both have an admiration for meat.\n\n1:25:42.880 --> 1:25:45.720\n Is there some aspect about optimal performance\n\n1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:46.840\n that you look for in food?\n\n1:25:46.840 --> 1:25:50.760\n Like maybe eating only like once or twice a day\n\n1:25:50.760 --> 1:25:52.360\n or a particular kind of food,\n\n1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:54.080\n like meat heavy diet.\n\n1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:55.120\n Is there anything like that?\n\n1:25:55.120 --> 1:25:57.480\n Or are you just trying to have fun with the food?\n\n1:25:57.480 --> 1:26:01.080\n I think whenever I'm at tournaments,\n\n1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:03.760\n like it's very natural to eat,\n\n1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:06.120\n at least for me to eat only twice a day.\n\n1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:08.800\n So usually I do that when I'm at home as well.\n\n1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:11.000\n So you do eat before the tournament though.\n\n1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:12.920\n You don't play fasted.\n\n1:26:12.920 --> 1:26:13.840\n No, no, no, no.\n\n1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:18.840\n But I try not to eat too heavy before the game\n\n1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:22.520\n or in general to avoid sugary stuff\n\n1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:26.760\n to have a pretty stable blood sugar level.\n\n1:26:26.760 --> 1:26:29.040\n Cause that's the easiest way to make mistake\n\n1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:33.560\n that your energy levels just suddenly drop\n\n1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:37.080\n and they don't necessarily need to be too high\n\n1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:39.320\n as long as they're pretty stable, yeah.\n\n1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:41.360\n Have you ever tried playing fasted,\n\n1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:44.600\n like intermittent fasting?\n\n1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:46.960\n So playing without having eaten.\n\n1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:49.000\n I mean, the reason I ask, you know,\n\n1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:52.160\n especially when you do a low carb diet,\n\n1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:54.400\n when I've done a person at low carb diet,\n\n1:26:54.400 --> 1:26:55.880\n I'm able to fast for a long time,\n\n1:26:55.880 --> 1:26:58.520\n like eat once a day, maybe twice a day.\n\n1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:00.680\n But I just, the mind is most focused\n\n1:27:00.680 --> 1:27:05.680\n on like really difficult thinking tasks when it's fasted.\n\n1:27:05.880 --> 1:27:06.720\n It's an interesting,\n\n1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:09.280\n and a lot of people kind of talk about that.\n\n1:27:09.280 --> 1:27:11.480\n Yeah, but you're able to kind of like zoom in\n\n1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:13.120\n and if you're doing a low carb diet,\n\n1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:15.400\n you don't have the energy stable.\n\n1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:17.000\n You know, that is true.\n\n1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:18.840\n Maybe that will be interesting to try.\n\n1:27:18.840 --> 1:27:21.120\n So what's happened for me,\n\n1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:24.520\n I played a few tournaments where I've had food poisoning\n\n1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:26.320\n and then that generally means\n\n1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:31.080\n that you're both sleep deprived and you have no energy.\n\n1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:36.080\n And what I've found is that it makes me,\n\n1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:38.040\n it makes me very calm, of course,\n\n1:27:38.040 --> 1:27:40.600\n because I don't have the energy\n\n1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:42.880\n and it makes me super creative.\n\n1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:43.720\n Interesting.\n\n1:27:43.720 --> 1:27:45.480\n Sleep deprived probably I think in general\n\n1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:47.120\n makes you creative.\n\n1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:48.760\n Just the first thing that goes away\n\n1:27:48.760 --> 1:27:51.800\n is the ability to do the simple things.\n\n1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:54.760\n That's what it affects you the most.\n\n1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:56.560\n Like you cannot be precise.\n\n1:27:56.560 --> 1:27:58.600\n So that's the only thing I'm worried about.\n\n1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:03.600\n Like if I'm fasted that I won't be precise when I play.\n\n1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:08.320\n But you might be more creative.\n\n1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:09.160\n It's an interesting trial.\n\n1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:12.000\n Fasted, yeah, potentially.\n\n1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.000\n What about you have been known to\n\n1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.600\n on a rare occasion play drunk.\n\n1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:18.360\n Is there a mathematical formula\n\n1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:22.240\n for sort of on the X axis how many drinks you had\n\n1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:26.760\n and on the Y axis your performance slash creativity?\n\n1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:28.360\n Is there like an optimal for,\n\n1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:29.600\n like one of the,\n\n1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:31.800\n would you suggest for the FIDE World Championship\n\n1:28:31.800 --> 1:28:34.120\n that people would be required to drink?\n\n1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:36.440\n Would that change things in interesting ways?\n\n1:28:36.440 --> 1:28:38.200\n Yeah, not at all.\n\n1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:40.880\n Maybe for rapid, but for Blitz,\n\n1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:41.880\n think if you're playing Blitz,\n\n1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:46.880\n you're mostly playing on short calculation and intuition.\n\n1:28:47.400 --> 1:28:50.480\n And I think those are probably enhanced\n\n1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:54.200\n if you've had a little bit of, a little bit to drink.\n\n1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:58.840\n Can you explain the physiology of why that's,\n\n1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:01.080\n why it's enhanced or the?\n\n1:29:01.080 --> 1:29:03.240\n You're just, you're thinking less.\n\n1:29:03.240 --> 1:29:04.840\n You're more confident.\n\n1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:06.160\n Oh yeah, it's confidence.\n\n1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:07.840\n I think it's just confidence.\n\n1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:11.760\n I think also like a lot of people feel like they're better\n\n1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:15.240\n at speaking languages, for instance,\n\n1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:17.000\n if they've drunk a little bit,\n\n1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.960\n it's just like removing these barriers.\n\n1:29:19.960 --> 1:29:24.960\n I think that it's a little bit of the same in chess.\n\n1:29:25.240 --> 1:29:27.600\n In 2012, I played the World Blitz Championship.\n\n1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:32.600\n And then I was doing horribly for a long time.\n\n1:29:33.080 --> 1:29:34.920\n I also had food poisoning there.\n\n1:29:34.920 --> 1:29:37.560\n I couldn't play at all for three days.\n\n1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:39.160\n So before the last break,\n\n1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:43.520\n I was like in the middle of the pack, like in,\n\n1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:46.960\n I don't know, 20th place or something.\n\n1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:51.200\n And so I decided like, as the last, last gasp,\n\n1:29:51.200 --> 1:29:54.880\n I'm going to go to the mini bar and just have a few drinks.\n\n1:29:54.880 --> 1:29:58.080\n And what happened is that I came back\n\n1:29:58.080 --> 1:30:02.280\n and I was suddenly relaxed and I was playing fast\n\n1:30:02.280 --> 1:30:03.520\n and I was playing confidence.\n\n1:30:03.520 --> 1:30:05.640\n And I thought I was playing so well.\n\n1:30:05.640 --> 1:30:08.600\n I wasn't playing nearly as well as I thought,\n\n1:30:08.600 --> 1:30:10.080\n but it still helped me.\n\n1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:11.880\n Like I won my remaining eight games.\n\n1:30:11.880 --> 1:30:14.560\n And if there had been one more round,\n\n1:30:14.560 --> 1:30:16.040\n I probably would have won the whole thing.\n\n1:30:16.040 --> 1:30:18.200\n But finally I was second.\n\n1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:20.960\n So generally I wouldn't recommend that,\n\n1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:23.120\n but maybe as the last resort sometimes,\n\n1:30:23.120 --> 1:30:25.920\n like if you feel that you have the ability,\n\n1:30:25.920 --> 1:30:29.480\n like obviously none of this is remotely relevant\n\n1:30:29.480 --> 1:30:31.800\n if you don't feel like you have the ability to begin with.\n\n1:30:31.800 --> 1:30:34.080\n But if you feel like you have the ability,\n\n1:30:34.080 --> 1:30:39.080\n there are just factors that make it impossible\n\n1:30:39.320 --> 1:30:42.040\n for you to show it.\n\n1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:45.200\n Like numbing your mind a bit can probably be a good thing.\n\n1:30:45.200 --> 1:30:47.920\n Yeah, well, it's interesting, especially during training,\n\n1:30:47.920 --> 1:30:51.040\n you have all kinds of sports that have interacted\n\n1:30:51.040 --> 1:30:54.640\n with a lot of athletes and grappling sports.\n\n1:30:54.640 --> 1:30:57.080\n It's different when you train under extreme exhaustion.\n\n1:30:57.080 --> 1:30:59.320\n For example, you start becoming,\n\n1:30:59.320 --> 1:31:01.480\n you start to discover interesting things.\n\n1:31:01.480 --> 1:31:02.920\n You start being more creative.\n\n1:31:02.920 --> 1:31:07.840\n A lot of people, at least in Brazilian jiu jitsu,\n\n1:31:07.840 --> 1:31:09.480\n they'll smoke weed.\n\n1:31:09.480 --> 1:31:12.580\n It creates this kind of anxiety and relaxation\n\n1:31:12.580 --> 1:31:16.040\n that kind of enables that creative aspect.\n\n1:31:16.040 --> 1:31:17.440\n It's interesting for training.\n\n1:31:17.440 --> 1:31:20.420\n Of course you can't rely on any one of those things too much,\n\n1:31:20.420 --> 1:31:22.520\n but it's cool to throw in like a few drinks\n\n1:31:22.520 --> 1:31:25.080\n every once in a while to, yeah.\n\n1:31:25.080 --> 1:31:28.320\n One, first of all, to relax and have fun.\n\n1:31:28.320 --> 1:31:30.580\n And two, to kind of try things differently,\n\n1:31:30.580 --> 1:31:32.480\n to unlock a different part of your brain.\n\n1:31:32.480 --> 1:31:33.720\n Yeah, for sure.\n\n1:31:33.720 --> 1:31:35.880\n What about supplements?\n\n1:31:35.880 --> 1:31:38.440\n Do you, are you a coffee guy?\n\n1:31:38.440 --> 1:31:39.320\n Oh no.\n\n1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:42.600\n I quite like the taste of coffee.\n\n1:31:44.280 --> 1:31:46.320\n But the thing is I've never had a job.\n\n1:31:48.040 --> 1:31:50.720\n So I've never needed to wake up early.\n\n1:31:50.720 --> 1:31:55.720\n So my thought is basically that if I'm tired, I'm tired.\n\n1:31:55.760 --> 1:31:56.920\n That's fine.\n\n1:31:56.920 --> 1:32:01.560\n Then I'll, you know, then I'll work it out.\n\n1:32:01.560 --> 1:32:06.560\n So I don't wanna ever make my brain get used to coffee.\n\n1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:10.440\n Like if you see me drinking coffee,\n\n1:32:10.440 --> 1:32:15.440\n that's, that probably means that I'm massively,\n\n1:32:16.160 --> 1:32:19.080\n massively hungover and I don't,\n\n1:32:19.080 --> 1:32:24.080\n I just want to try anything to make my brain work.\n\n1:32:24.420 --> 1:32:25.260\n Yeah, that's interesting.\n\n1:32:25.260 --> 1:32:27.280\n But for a lot of people, like you said, taste of coffee,\n\n1:32:27.280 --> 1:32:29.560\n for a lot of people coffee is part\n\n1:32:29.560 --> 1:32:31.240\n of a certain kind of ritual.\n\n1:32:31.240 --> 1:32:32.080\n Yeah, for sure.\n\n1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:32.920\n That they enjoy, you know.\n\n1:32:32.920 --> 1:32:34.920\n So, but you can have rituals without that.\n\n1:32:34.920 --> 1:32:36.320\n I know that I would enjoy it a lot.\n\n1:32:36.320 --> 1:32:39.040\n Yeah, just you don't wanna rely on it.\n\n1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:39.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:40.840 --> 1:32:44.240\n I also like the taste, so there's no problem there.\n\n1:32:44.240 --> 1:32:46.820\n What about exercise?\n\n1:32:47.680 --> 1:32:51.860\n So how does that, what like, what, you know,\n\n1:32:51.860 --> 1:32:54.120\n a lot of people talk about the extreme\n\n1:32:56.880 --> 1:32:59.000\n stress that chest puts in your body,\n\n1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:00.380\n physically and mentally.\n\n1:33:00.380 --> 1:33:02.880\n How do you prepare for that, to be physically and mentally?\n\n1:33:02.880 --> 1:33:04.160\n Is it just through playing chess,\n\n1:33:04.160 --> 1:33:07.240\n or do you do cardio and any of that kind of stuff?\n\n1:33:07.240 --> 1:33:08.980\n This is kind of it up and down.\n\n1:33:08.980 --> 1:33:13.980\n Like, as I said in 2013, I was in, I was in great shape.\n\n1:33:15.540 --> 1:33:18.880\n Like, I mean, generally I was exercising,\n\n1:33:18.880 --> 1:33:22.400\n doing sports every day, either playing football\n\n1:33:22.400 --> 1:33:26.840\n or tennis or even other, other sports.\n\n1:33:26.840 --> 1:33:28.360\n Otherwise, if I couldn't do that,\n\n1:33:28.360 --> 1:33:33.360\n I would try and take my bike for a ride.\n\n1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:36.680\n I had a few training camps and I played tennis\n\n1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:38.660\n against one of my seconds.\n\n1:33:38.660 --> 1:33:42.000\n Like, he's not a super fit guy,\n\n1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:43.680\n but he's always been very good at tennis.\n\n1:33:43.680 --> 1:33:47.320\n And I never like played in any organized way.\n\n1:33:47.320 --> 1:33:50.280\n And that was like, that was the perfect exercise\n\n1:33:50.280 --> 1:33:54.400\n because I was running around enough\n\n1:33:54.400 --> 1:33:58.600\n to make the games pretty competitive.\n\n1:33:58.600 --> 1:34:01.880\n And it meant that he had to run a bit less as well.\n\n1:34:01.880 --> 1:34:03.880\n But he was just, he said like,\n\n1:34:05.480 --> 1:34:10.480\n he was shocked that if we played like for two hours,\n\n1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:13.480\n I wouldn't flinch at all.\n\n1:34:13.480 --> 1:34:14.320\n Interesting.\n\n1:34:14.320 --> 1:34:15.520\n So like a combination of fun\n\n1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:20.300\n and the differential between skill\n\n1:34:20.300 --> 1:34:21.720\n result in good cardio.\n\n1:34:21.720 --> 1:34:26.720\n Yeah, but it's just that, so in those days I was pretty,\n\n1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:29.200\n I was pretty fit in that sense.\n\n1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:32.880\n I've always liked doing sports, but at times, you know,\n\n1:34:32.880 --> 1:34:34.960\n I think in winter, especially,\n\n1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:37.740\n like I never had like a schedule.\n\n1:34:37.740 --> 1:34:42.200\n So at times I'll let myself go a little bit.\n\n1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:45.640\n And I've always kind of done it more for fun\n\n1:34:45.640 --> 1:34:48.520\n than like for a concrete benefit.\n\n1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:51.920\n But now I'm at least after the pandemic,\n\n1:34:51.920 --> 1:34:52.960\n I was not in great shape.\n\n1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:55.960\n So now I'm trying to get back, get better,\n\n1:34:56.820 --> 1:35:00.080\n get better habits and so on.\n\n1:35:00.080 --> 1:35:05.080\n But I feel like I've always been the poster boy\n\n1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:11.080\n for making being fit a big thing in chess.\n\n1:35:11.760 --> 1:35:14.760\n And I always felt that it was not really a deserve\n\n1:35:14.760 --> 1:35:18.360\n because I never liked doing weights much at all.\n\n1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:23.960\n I run a bit at times, but I never liked it too much.\n\n1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:24.800\n You just love playing sports.\n\n1:35:24.800 --> 1:35:26.520\n I just love playing sports.\n\n1:35:26.520 --> 1:35:28.680\n So that I think people confuse that\n\n1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:31.240\n because I'm not like massively athletic,\n\n1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:35.520\n but I do, I am decent at sports\n\n1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:39.440\n and that sort of helped build that perception.\n\n1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:42.760\n Even though others who are top level chess players,\n\n1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:46.480\n they're more fit like Karana, for instance,\n\n1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:51.480\n he's really, really, his body is really, really strong.\n\n1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:52.480\n It's just that he doesn't.\n\n1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:53.800\n He like goes to the gym and.\n\n1:35:53.800 --> 1:35:57.440\n Yeah, if he doesn't play sports, that's the difference.\n\n1:35:57.440 --> 1:35:59.600\n And the thing about sports is also is just,\n\n1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:02.440\n it's an escape.\n\n1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:05.400\n It helps you forget for a brief moment\n\n1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:09.260\n about like the obsessions, the pursuits of the main thing,\n\n1:36:09.260 --> 1:36:10.100\n which is chess.\n\n1:36:10.100 --> 1:36:12.360\n Yeah, for sure.\n\n1:36:12.360 --> 1:36:16.440\n And I think it's, it also helps your main pursuit\n\n1:36:16.440 --> 1:36:20.200\n to feel that you're even if not mastering,\n\n1:36:20.200 --> 1:36:24.200\n but like doing well in something, in something else.\n\n1:36:24.200 --> 1:36:28.480\n Like I found that if I just juggle a ball,\n\n1:36:28.480 --> 1:36:30.480\n that makes me feel better before a game.\n\n1:36:32.280 --> 1:36:34.680\n So a skilled activity.\n\n1:36:34.680 --> 1:36:35.720\n Juggle of football, yeah.\n\n1:36:35.720 --> 1:36:39.920\n Yeah, skilled activity that you can improve on over time.\n\n1:36:39.920 --> 1:36:42.360\n It like flexes the same kind of muscle,\n\n1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:44.320\n but on the thing that you're much worse at.\n\n1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:45.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:36:45.320 --> 1:36:47.920\n It focuses you, relaxes you, that's really interesting.\n\n1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:52.200\n What's the perfect day in the life of Magnus Carlsen\n\n1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:53.920\n when he's training?\n\n1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:55.960\n So like, what's a good training regimen\n\n1:36:55.960 --> 1:36:59.480\n in terms of, you know, daily kind of training\n\n1:36:59.480 --> 1:37:04.040\n that you have to put in across many days, months, and years\n\n1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:07.080\n to just keep yourself sharp in terms of chess?\n\n1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:10.480\n I would say when I'm at home, I do very little\n\n1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:12.220\n deliberate practice.\n\n1:37:12.220 --> 1:37:14.020\n I've never been that guy at all.\n\n1:37:14.020 --> 1:37:18.880\n Like I could never force myself to just sit down and work.\n\n1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:22.400\n So deliberate practice, just so maybe you can educate me,\n\n1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:25.560\n for some grandmasters, what would that look like?\n\n1:37:25.560 --> 1:37:27.660\n Just doing puzzles kind of thing?\n\n1:37:27.660 --> 1:37:28.500\n Or like?\n\n1:37:28.500 --> 1:37:30.560\n Yeah, doing puzzles and opening analysis.\n\n1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:32.120\n That would be the main things.\n\n1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:34.700\n Studying games?\n\n1:37:34.700 --> 1:37:38.820\n Just studying games, yeah, a little bit.\n\n1:37:38.820 --> 1:37:42.060\n But I feel like that's something that I do.\n\n1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:47.040\n But it's not deliberate, it's like reading an article\n\n1:37:47.040 --> 1:37:48.120\n or reading a book.\n\n1:37:48.120 --> 1:37:48.960\n Got it.\n\n1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:52.680\n Like I love chess books, I'll read just anything\n\n1:37:52.680 --> 1:37:54.520\n and I'll find something interesting.\n\n1:37:54.520 --> 1:37:57.200\n So chess books that are like on openings\n\n1:37:57.200 --> 1:37:58.640\n and stuff like that, or chess books\n\n1:37:58.640 --> 1:38:00.520\n that go over different games?\n\n1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:05.520\n Yeah, books on, so there are three main categories.\n\n1:38:05.520 --> 1:38:07.440\n There are books on openings and there are books\n\n1:38:07.440 --> 1:38:09.520\n on strategy and there are books on chess history\n\n1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:12.740\n and I find all of them very, very interesting.\n\n1:38:12.740 --> 1:38:14.440\n Like what fraction of the day would you say\n\n1:38:14.440 --> 1:38:18.280\n you have a chess board floating somewhere in your head?\n\n1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:20.520\n Meaning like you're thinking about it.\n\n1:38:21.380 --> 1:38:23.580\n Probably be a better question to ask,\n\n1:38:23.580 --> 1:38:26.640\n how many hours a day I don't have a chess board floating.\n\n1:38:26.640 --> 1:38:27.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:27.480 --> 1:38:30.640\n I mean it could be just floating there and nothing's\n\n1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:32.520\n happening, but like.\n\n1:38:32.520 --> 1:38:35.860\n I often do it parallel to some other activity though.\n\n1:38:35.860 --> 1:38:37.080\n And what does that look like?\n\n1:38:37.080 --> 1:38:39.900\n Like are you daydreaming like different,\n\n1:38:39.900 --> 1:38:42.240\n is it actual positions you're just fucking around with?\n\n1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:45.560\n Like fumbling with different pieces in your head?\n\n1:38:45.560 --> 1:38:50.120\n Often I've looked at a random game on my phone for instance\n\n1:38:50.120 --> 1:38:53.920\n or in a book and then my brain just keeps going\n\n1:38:53.920 --> 1:38:56.840\n at the same position analyzing it and often it goes\n\n1:38:56.840 --> 1:38:58.560\n all the way to the end game.\n\n1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:02.280\n And those are actual games or you conjure up like fake games?\n\n1:39:02.280 --> 1:39:05.040\n No, they were often based on real games\n\n1:39:05.040 --> 1:39:07.800\n and then I'm thinking like oh, but it wouldn't be\n\n1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:10.600\n more interesting if the pieces were a little bit different\n\n1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:12.920\n and then often I play it out from there.\n\n1:39:12.920 --> 1:39:17.460\n So you don't have, like you don't sit behind a computer\n\n1:39:17.460 --> 1:39:20.960\n or a chess board and you lay out the pieces and then you're.\n\n1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:25.000\n No, I'm not at all a poster boy for deliberate practice.\n\n1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.640\n I could never, I could never work that way.\n\n1:39:27.640 --> 1:39:32.640\n My first coach, he gave me some exercises\n\n1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:37.000\n that are at home sometimes, but he realized at some point\n\n1:39:38.120 --> 1:39:39.320\n that wasn't gonna work.\n\n1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:40.380\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:40.380 --> 1:39:44.200\n Because I wouldn't do it really or enjoy it.\n\n1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:48.640\n So what he would do instead is that at the school\n\n1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:50.100\n where I had the trainings with him,\n\n1:39:50.100 --> 1:39:54.200\n there was this massive chess library.\n\n1:39:54.200 --> 1:39:56.800\n So he was just like yeah, pick out books.\n\n1:39:56.800 --> 1:40:00.360\n You can have anything, you can have anything you want.\n\n1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:01.680\n Just pick out books you like\n\n1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:03.360\n and then you give it back the next time.\n\n1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:05.240\n So that's what I did instead.\n\n1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:08.160\n Yeah, I just absolutely raided the,\n\n1:40:08.160 --> 1:40:11.880\n then my next tournament I will try out one of the openings\n\n1:40:11.880 --> 1:40:14.480\n from that book if it was an opening book and so on.\n\n1:40:14.480 --> 1:40:17.560\n Does it feel like a struggle, like challenging?\n\n1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:19.520\n Like to be thinking those positions\n\n1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:20.940\n or is it fun and relaxing?\n\n1:40:20.940 --> 1:40:22.360\n No, it's completely fine.\n\n1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:24.320\n I don't.\n\n1:40:24.320 --> 1:40:26.240\n Like if it's a difficult position to figure out,\n\n1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:27.760\n you know, like to calculate.\n\n1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:29.240\n Then I go on to something else.\n\n1:40:29.240 --> 1:40:30.360\n Okay.\n\n1:40:30.360 --> 1:40:33.920\n Like if I can't figure it out, then you know, I go on.\n\n1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:37.680\n Change it so that it's easier to figure out.\n\n1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:38.920\n There was a point in your life\n\n1:40:38.920 --> 1:40:42.280\n where Kasparov was interested in being your coach\n\n1:40:42.280 --> 1:40:43.520\n or at least training with you.\n\n1:40:43.520 --> 1:40:45.540\n Why did you choose not to go with him?\n\n1:40:45.540 --> 1:40:46.880\n That's a pretty bold move.\n\n1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:49.120\n Was there a good reason for this?\n\n1:40:49.120 --> 1:40:54.120\n No, the first like homework exercise he gave me\n\n1:40:54.580 --> 1:40:58.440\n was to analyze, like he picked out, I think,\n\n1:40:58.440 --> 1:41:00.200\n three or four of my worst losses\n\n1:41:00.200 --> 1:41:05.200\n and he wanted me to analyze them and give him my thoughts.\n\n1:41:05.440 --> 1:41:08.340\n And it wasn't that there were painful losses or anything\n\n1:41:08.340 --> 1:41:10.540\n that that was a problem.\n\n1:41:10.540 --> 1:41:14.200\n I just didn't really enjoy that.\n\n1:41:14.200 --> 1:41:19.200\n Also, I felt that this whole structured approach\n\n1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:20.280\n and everything.\n\n1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:21.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:23.560\n I just felt like from the start, it was a hassle.\n\n1:41:23.560 --> 1:41:28.160\n So I loved the idea of being able to pick his brain\n\n1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:32.160\n but everything else, I just, you know,\n\n1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:35.800\n couldn't see myself, couldn't see myself enjoying.\n\n1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:38.480\n And at the end of the day,\n\n1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:42.200\n I did then and always have played for fun.\n\n1:41:42.200 --> 1:41:45.200\n That's always been the main reason, so.\n\n1:41:45.200 --> 1:41:46.560\n It's great that you had the confidence\n\n1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:50.460\n to sort of basically turn down the approach\n\n1:41:50.460 --> 1:41:52.760\n of one of the greatest chess players of all time.\n\n1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:54.640\n At that time, probably the greatest chess player\n\n1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:55.780\n of all time.\n\n1:41:55.780 --> 1:41:58.200\n I don't think I thought of it that way.\n\n1:41:58.200 --> 1:42:00.120\n I just thought this is not for me.\n\n1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:01.680\n I wouldn't try another way.\n\n1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:03.260\n I don't think I was particularly thinking\n\n1:42:03.260 --> 1:42:06.240\n that this is my one opportunity or anything.\n\n1:42:06.240 --> 1:42:08.320\n It was just, yeah, I don't enjoy this.\n\n1:42:08.320 --> 1:42:09.600\n Let's try something else.\n\n1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:12.520\n When you were 13, you faced Kasparov\n\n1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:14.400\n and he wasn't able to beat you.\n\n1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:16.960\n Can you go through that match?\n\n1:42:16.960 --> 1:42:17.880\n What did that feel like?\n\n1:42:17.880 --> 1:42:19.040\n How important was that?\n\n1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:20.980\n Was that, how epic was that?\n\n1:42:20.980 --> 1:42:22.740\n We played three games.\n\n1:42:22.740 --> 1:42:25.660\n I lost two and I drew one.\n\n1:42:25.660 --> 1:42:27.040\n Right, but one draw.\n\n1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:28.420\n No, the one draw.\n\n1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:30.400\n And but didn't you say\n\n1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:32.800\n that you kind of had a better position in that?\n\n1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:35.000\n Yeah, I remember that day very well.\n\n1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:36.440\n There was a Blitz game.\n\n1:42:36.440 --> 1:42:38.400\n This was a rapid tournament\n\n1:42:38.400 --> 1:42:41.240\n and there was a Blitz tournament the day before\n\n1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:46.000\n which determined the pairings for the rapid.\n\n1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:47.400\n For people who don't know,\n\n1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:49.320\n super short games are called bullet.\n\n1:42:49.320 --> 1:42:51.880\n Kind of short games are called Blitz.\n\n1:42:51.880 --> 1:42:54.440\n Semi short games are called rapid.\n\n1:42:54.440 --> 1:42:56.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:56.080 --> 1:42:59.000\n And classic chess, I guess, is like very super long.\n\n1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:00.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:02.420\n Yeah, basically, bullet is just never played\n\n1:43:02.420 --> 1:43:03.260\n over the board.\n\n1:43:03.260 --> 1:43:05.200\n So in terms of over the board chess,\n\n1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:06.600\n Blitz is the shortest.\n\n1:43:06.600 --> 1:43:11.300\n Rapid is like a hybrid between classical and Blitz.\n\n1:43:11.300 --> 1:43:12.800\n You need to have the skills to both\n\n1:43:12.800 --> 1:43:15.040\n and then classical is long.\n\n1:43:15.040 --> 1:43:18.480\n The Blitz tournament, which didn't go so well.\n\n1:43:18.480 --> 1:43:19.640\n Like I got a couple of wins,\n\n1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:22.200\n but I was beaten badly in a lot of games,\n\n1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:24.040\n including by Gary.\n\n1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:27.280\n And so there was the pairing that I had to play him\n\n1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:28.720\n which was pretty exciting.\n\n1:43:28.720 --> 1:43:31.640\n So I remember I was so tired after the Blitz tournament.\n\n1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:34.440\n Like I slept for 12 hours or something.\n\n1:43:34.440 --> 1:43:35.840\n Then I woke up like,\n\n1:43:35.840 --> 1:43:37.480\n okay, I'll turn on my computer.\n\n1:43:37.480 --> 1:43:41.240\n I'll search chess space for Kasparov\n\n1:43:41.240 --> 1:43:42.760\n and we'll go from there.\n\n1:43:44.280 --> 1:43:47.160\n So before that, I hadn't spent like a lot of time\n\n1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:49.080\n specifically studying his games.\n\n1:43:49.080 --> 1:43:51.040\n It was super intimidating\n\n1:43:51.040 --> 1:43:54.360\n because a lot of these openings I knew.\n\n1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:56.840\n I was like, oh, he was the first one to play that.\n\n1:43:56.840 --> 1:43:57.920\n Oh, that was his idea.\n\n1:43:57.920 --> 1:43:59.640\n I actually didn't know that.\n\n1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:02.560\n So I was a bit intimidated before we played.\n\n1:44:02.560 --> 1:44:04.600\n Then of course the first game,\n\n1:44:04.600 --> 1:44:08.680\n he arrived a bit late because they changed the time\n\n1:44:08.680 --> 1:44:11.640\n from the first day to the other, which was a bit strange.\n\n1:44:11.640 --> 1:44:13.840\n But everybody else had noticed it but him.\n\n1:44:15.280 --> 1:44:17.720\n Then he tried to surprise me in the opening.\n\n1:44:17.720 --> 1:44:19.880\n I think like psychologically,\n\n1:44:19.880 --> 1:44:21.520\n the situation was not so easy for him.\n\n1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:23.440\n Like clearly it would be embarrassing for him\n\n1:44:23.440 --> 1:44:26.840\n if he didn't win both games against me.\n\n1:44:26.840 --> 1:44:30.800\n Then like I was spending way too much time on my moves\n\n1:44:30.800 --> 1:44:32.200\n because I was playing Kasparov.\n\n1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:33.800\n I was double checking everything too much.\n\n1:44:33.800 --> 1:44:37.520\n Like normally I would be playing pretty fast in those days.\n\n1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:42.240\n And then at some point I calculated better than him.\n\n1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:46.640\n He missed a crucial detail and had a much better position.\n\n1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:48.000\n I couldn't convert it though.\n\n1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:49.680\n I knew what line I had to go for\n\n1:44:50.880 --> 1:44:52.960\n in order to have a chance to win.\n\n1:44:52.960 --> 1:44:55.720\n But I thought like, I'll play a bit more carefully.\n\n1:44:55.720 --> 1:44:56.800\n Maybe I can win still.\n\n1:44:56.800 --> 1:44:58.280\n I couldn't.\n\n1:44:58.280 --> 1:45:01.760\n And then I lost the second game pretty badly,\n\n1:45:01.760 --> 1:45:04.440\n which it wasn't majorly upsetting,\n\n1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:07.320\n but I felt that I had two black games\n\n1:45:07.320 --> 1:45:09.680\n against Kasparov both in the blitz and the rapid\n\n1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:12.800\n and I lost both of them without any fight whatsoever.\n\n1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:14.600\n I wasn't happy about that at all.\n\n1:45:14.600 --> 1:45:19.080\n That was like less than I thought I could be able to do.\n\n1:45:19.080 --> 1:45:24.080\n So to me, yeah, I was proud of that, but it was a gimmick.\n\n1:45:25.840 --> 1:45:30.400\n That was like a very strong IAM that had GM strength.\n\n1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:35.240\n I was like, it can happen that a player of that strength\n\n1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:37.640\n makes a draw against Gary once in a while.\n\n1:45:37.640 --> 1:45:40.520\n But I mean, I understand that I'm 13,\n\n1:45:40.520 --> 1:45:44.680\n but like still I felt a bit more gimmicky than anything.\n\n1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:48.880\n I mean, I guess it's a good thing that made me noticed,\n\n1:45:48.880 --> 1:45:51.640\n but apart from that, it wasn't.\n\n1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:52.960\n And for people who don't know,\n\n1:45:52.960 --> 1:45:56.160\n IAM is international master and GM is grand master.\n\n1:45:56.160 --> 1:45:58.000\n And you were just on the, I guess,\n\n1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:01.280\n on the verge of becoming a youngest grand master ever.\n\n1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:04.200\n I was the second youngest ever.\n\n1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:06.160\n I think I'm like the seventh youngest now.\n\n1:46:06.160 --> 1:46:08.040\n I mean, these kids these days.\n\n1:46:08.040 --> 1:46:08.960\n Kids these days.\n\n1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:10.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:14.320\n Yeah, but I was the youngest grand master at the time\n\n1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:16.320\n in the world.\n\n1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:17.160\n Yeah.\n\n1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:20.080\n So there is a, you say it's gimmicky,\n\n1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:21.760\n but there's a romantic notions,\n\n1:46:22.880 --> 1:46:26.520\n especially as things have turned out, right?\n\n1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:27.440\n No, for sure.\n\n1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:30.480\n And have you talked to Gary since then about that?\n\n1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:31.560\n No, not really.\n\n1:46:31.560 --> 1:46:33.960\n I think he's immersed.\n\n1:46:33.960 --> 1:46:35.200\n He's still bitter, you think?\n\n1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:36.960\n No, I don't think he's bitter,\n\n1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:41.760\n but I think the game in itself was a bit embarrassing for him.\n\n1:46:41.760 --> 1:46:45.480\n Even he can't see past like...\n\n1:46:45.480 --> 1:46:46.320\n No, no, no.\n\n1:46:46.320 --> 1:46:47.680\n I think he's completely fine with that.\n\n1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:51.000\n I think like in retrospect, it's a good story.\n\n1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:53.280\n He appreciates that.\n\n1:46:53.280 --> 1:46:54.440\n I don't think that's the problem,\n\n1:46:54.440 --> 1:46:58.360\n but it never made sense for me to broach the subject with him.\n\n1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:03.040\n Yeah, it's funny just having interacted with Gary,\n\n1:47:03.040 --> 1:47:04.920\n now having talked to you,\n\n1:47:04.920 --> 1:47:08.560\n there is a little thing you still hate losing.\n\n1:47:08.560 --> 1:47:11.200\n No matter how beautiful like that moment is,\n\n1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:14.480\n because it's like, in a way it's a passing of the baton\n\n1:47:14.480 --> 1:47:17.840\n from like one great champion to another, right?\n\n1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:19.880\n But you still just don't like the fact\n\n1:47:19.880 --> 1:47:22.960\n that you didn't play a good game from Gary's perspective.\n\n1:47:22.960 --> 1:47:24.800\n Like he still is just annoyed probably\n\n1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:27.280\n that he could have played better.\n\n1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:32.280\n And we did, so we did work together in 2009, quite a lot.\n\n1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:38.240\n And that corporation ended early 2010,\n\n1:47:38.720 --> 1:47:42.240\n but we did play a lot of training games in 2009,\n\n1:47:42.240 --> 1:47:47.120\n which was interesting because he was still very, very strong.\n\n1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:49.920\n And at that time it was fairly equal.\n\n1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:51.400\n Like he was out playing me quite a bit,\n\n1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:56.400\n but I was fighting well, so it was pretty even then.\n\n1:47:57.200 --> 1:47:59.720\n So I mean, I appreciate those games a lot more\n\n1:47:59.720 --> 1:48:03.440\n than some random game from when I was 13.\n\n1:48:03.440 --> 1:48:07.160\n And maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about,\n\n1:48:07.160 --> 1:48:12.160\n but I've always found it, at least based on that game,\n\n1:48:12.480 --> 1:48:15.280\n you couldn't tell that I was gonna take his,\n\n1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:17.040\n that I was gonna take his spot.\n\n1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:22.040\n Like I made a horrible blunder and lost to an Uzbek kid\n\n1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:25.360\n in the World Rapid Championship in 2018.\n\n1:48:28.800 --> 1:48:30.680\n And I mean, granted he was part of the team\n\n1:48:30.680 --> 1:48:32.880\n that now won gold in the Chess Olympia,\n\n1:48:32.880 --> 1:48:34.120\n but he wasn't the crucial part.\n\n1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:35.640\n He barely played any games.\n\n1:48:35.640 --> 1:48:37.240\n Like it wasn't like I would think\n\n1:48:37.240 --> 1:48:39.800\n that he would become world champion because he beat me.\n\n1:48:39.800 --> 1:48:42.200\n I'm always skeptical of those who said\n\n1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:44.520\n that they knew that I was gonna be world champion\n\n1:48:44.520 --> 1:48:48.320\n after that game or at all at that time.\n\n1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:50.080\n I mean, it was easy to see\n\n1:48:50.080 --> 1:48:52.720\n that I would become a very, very strong player.\n\n1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:53.760\n Everybody could see that,\n\n1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:57.400\n but to be the best in the world or one of the best ever,\n\n1:48:57.400 --> 1:48:59.440\n that's hard to say.\n\n1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:01.600\n It is hard to say, but I do remember seeing Messi\n\n1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:03.440\n when he was 16 and 17.\n\n1:49:05.320 --> 1:49:07.600\n But hasn't that happened with other players though?\n\n1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:10.840\n Yeah, but I just had a personal experience.\n\n1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:14.400\n He did look different than, there's like magic there.\n\n1:49:14.400 --> 1:49:18.360\n Maybe you can't tell he would be one of the greatest ever,\n\n1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:19.920\n but there's still magic.\n\n1:49:19.920 --> 1:49:20.760\n But you're right.\n\n1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:22.800\n Most of the time we try to project,\n\n1:49:22.800 --> 1:49:25.320\n we see a young kid being an older person\n\n1:49:25.320 --> 1:49:26.520\n and you start to think,\n\n1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:28.280\n okay, this could be the next great person.\n\n1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:30.200\n Then we forget when they don't become that.\n\n1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:31.040\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:33.320\n That's I think what happens.\n\n1:49:33.320 --> 1:49:34.800\n But when it does become.\n\n1:49:34.800 --> 1:49:38.240\n Or maybe some people are just so good\n\n1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:40.040\n at seeing these patterns that they can actually see.\n\n1:49:40.040 --> 1:49:41.440\n Aren't you supposed to do that kind of thing\n\n1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:44.040\n with fantasy football, like see the long shot\n\n1:49:44.040 --> 1:49:46.480\n and bet on them and then they turn out to be good?\n\n1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:47.320\n That's the whole point.\n\n1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:49.600\n No, you make a lot of long shot bets\n\n1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:52.000\n and then some of them come good.\n\n1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:54.440\n And then people call you a genius for making the bet.\n\n1:49:54.440 --> 1:49:56.760\n Well, let me ask you the goat question again,\n\n1:49:56.760 --> 1:49:59.200\n from fantasy perspective.\n\n1:49:59.200 --> 1:50:02.720\n Can you make the case for the greatest chess player\n\n1:50:02.720 --> 1:50:07.080\n of all time for each yourself, Magnus Carlsen,\n\n1:50:07.080 --> 1:50:09.240\n for Garry Kasparov, I don't know who else,\n\n1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:12.400\n Bobby Fischer, Mikhail Atal, anyone else,\n\n1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:16.400\n for Hikaru Nakamura?\n\n1:50:16.400 --> 1:50:17.240\n Just kidding.\n\n1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:22.040\n Yeah, I think I can make a case for myself,\n\n1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:23.640\n for Garry and for Fischer.\n\n1:50:23.640 --> 1:50:25.600\n So I'll start with Fischer.\n\n1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:28.880\n For him, it's very, very simple.\n\n1:50:30.240 --> 1:50:33.560\n He was ahead of his time, but that's like intangible.\n\n1:50:33.560 --> 1:50:35.840\n You can say that about a lot of people.\n\n1:50:35.840 --> 1:50:40.840\n But he had a peak from 1970 to 72\n\n1:50:40.840 --> 1:50:43.680\n when he was so much better than the others.\n\n1:50:43.680 --> 1:50:46.040\n He won 20 games in a row.\n\n1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:49.720\n Also the way that he played was so powerful\n\n1:50:49.720 --> 1:50:51.520\n and with so few mistakes\n\n1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:54.200\n that he just had no opposition there.\n\n1:50:54.200 --> 1:50:59.200\n So he had just a peak that's been better than anybody.\n\n1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:02.000\n The gap between first and second was the highest.\n\n1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:04.760\n The gap between him and others was greater\n\n1:51:04.760 --> 1:51:08.760\n than it's ever been in history at any other time.\n\n1:51:08.760 --> 1:51:12.840\n And that would be the argument for him.\n\n1:51:12.840 --> 1:51:17.840\n For Garry, he's played in a very competitive era\n\n1:51:18.400 --> 1:51:21.440\n and he's beaten several generations.\n\n1:51:21.440 --> 1:51:26.440\n He was the best, well, he was the consensus best player,\n\n1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:29.520\n I would say for almost 20 years,\n\n1:51:29.520 --> 1:51:34.520\n which nobody else has done at least in recent time.\n\n1:51:36.520 --> 1:51:38.040\n So the longevity.\n\n1:51:38.040 --> 1:51:39.680\n The longevity for sure.\n\n1:51:39.680 --> 1:51:44.680\n Also at his peak, he was not quite the level of Fisher\n\n1:51:46.160 --> 1:51:49.520\n in terms of the gap, but it was similar to,\n\n1:51:49.520 --> 1:51:52.880\n or I think even a little bit better than mine.\n\n1:51:52.880 --> 1:51:57.400\n As for me, I'm of course unbeaten\n\n1:51:57.400 --> 1:52:00.200\n as a world champion in five tries.\n\n1:52:00.200 --> 1:52:04.440\n I've been world number one for 11 years straight\n\n1:52:04.440 --> 1:52:07.680\n in an even more competitive era than Garry.\n\n1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:10.040\n I have the highest chest rating of all time.\n\n1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:15.040\n I have the longest streak ever without losing a game.\n\n1:52:15.320 --> 1:52:19.120\n I think for me, the main argument would be about the era\n\n1:52:19.120 --> 1:52:24.120\n where the engines have leveled the playing field so much\n\n1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:28.680\n that it's harder to dominate.\n\n1:52:28.680 --> 1:52:32.640\n And still, I haven't always been a clear number one,\n\n1:52:32.640 --> 1:52:35.000\n but I've been number one for 11 years.\n\n1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:39.440\n And for a lot of the time, the gap has been pretty big.\n\n1:52:39.440 --> 1:52:43.360\n So I think there are decent arguments for all of them.\n\n1:52:43.360 --> 1:52:45.680\n I've said before, and I haven't changed my mind\n\n1:52:45.680 --> 1:52:48.040\n that Garry generally edges it\n\n1:52:48.040 --> 1:52:51.680\n because of the longevity in the competitive era,\n\n1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:55.000\n but there are arguments.\n\n1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:56.760\n But people also talk about you\n\n1:52:56.760 --> 1:52:58.280\n in terms of the style of play.\n\n1:52:58.280 --> 1:53:01.440\n So it's not just about dominance or the height or the,\n\n1:53:01.440 --> 1:53:05.360\n it's like just the creative genius of it.\n\n1:53:05.360 --> 1:53:07.200\n Yeah, but I'm not interested in that.\n\n1:53:07.200 --> 1:53:11.600\n In terms of greatest of all time,\n\n1:53:11.600 --> 1:53:16.240\n I'm not interested in questions of style.\n\n1:53:16.240 --> 1:53:20.280\n So for Messi, you don't give credit for the style,\n\n1:53:20.280 --> 1:53:21.160\n for the stylistic.\n\n1:53:21.160 --> 1:53:24.320\n I like, no, I like watching it, I just.\n\n1:53:24.320 --> 1:53:27.280\n But you're not gonna give points for the,\n\n1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:30.400\n so Messi gets the best ever because of the finishing.\n\n1:53:30.400 --> 1:53:34.360\n Yeah, it's the, no, it's not because of the finishing,\n\n1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:37.520\n it's because of his overall impact on the game.\n\n1:53:37.520 --> 1:53:39.360\n It's higher than anybody else's.\n\n1:53:39.360 --> 1:53:40.200\n Okay.\n\n1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:45.280\n He contributes, he just contributes more to winning\n\n1:53:45.280 --> 1:53:46.960\n than anybody else does.\n\n1:53:46.960 --> 1:53:51.000\n What's, so you're somebody who was advocated for\n\n1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:53.760\n and has done quite a bit of study of classic games.\n\n1:53:53.760 --> 1:53:58.760\n What would you say is, I mean, maybe the number one\n\n1:53:58.760 --> 1:54:01.960\n or maybe top three games of chess ever played?\n\n1:54:01.960 --> 1:54:04.440\n That doesn't interest me at all.\n\n1:54:04.440 --> 1:54:05.760\n You don't think of them, that was very curious.\n\n1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:06.600\n No, I don't think of it.\n\n1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:09.000\n I mean, I try to, I find the games interesting.\n\n1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:12.200\n I try to learn from them, but like trying to rank them\n\n1:54:12.200 --> 1:54:13.200\n has never interested me.\n\n1:54:13.200 --> 1:54:16.600\n What games pop out to you as like super interesting then?\n\n1:54:16.600 --> 1:54:20.640\n Is there things like where idea, like old school games\n\n1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:25.640\n where there was like interesting ideas that you go back,\n\n1:54:25.640 --> 1:54:29.240\n that you go back or like you find surprising\n\n1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:32.160\n and pretty cool that those ideas are developed like that?\n\n1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:35.440\n Is there something that jumps to mind?\n\n1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:40.360\n Yeah, there are several games of young Kasparov,\n\n1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:43.200\n like before he became world champion.\n\n1:54:43.200 --> 1:54:45.880\n If you're gonna ask for like my favorite player\n\n1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:47.760\n or favorite style, that's probably.\n\n1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:48.760\n Young Kasparov.\n\n1:54:48.760 --> 1:54:49.600\n Young Kasparov.\n\n1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:52.720\n Can you describe stylistically or in any other way\n\n1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:57.080\n what young Kasparov was like that you like?\n\n1:54:57.080 --> 1:54:59.880\n It was just an overflow energy in his play.\n\n1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:00.920\n So aggressive.\n\n1:55:00.920 --> 1:55:04.240\n Yeah, extremely aggressive, dynamic chess.\n\n1:55:04.240 --> 1:55:09.240\n It probably appeals to me a lot because these are the things\n\n1:55:09.800 --> 1:55:11.400\n that I cannot do as well,\n\n1:55:13.280 --> 1:55:15.720\n that it just feels very special to me.\n\n1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:17.760\n But yeah, in terms of games,\n\n1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:21.840\n I never thought about that too much.\n\n1:55:23.120 --> 1:55:28.120\n Is there memories, big or small, weird, surprising,\n\n1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:33.880\n just any kind of beautiful anecdote from your chess career?\n\n1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:37.040\n Like stuff that pops out that people might not know about?\n\n1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:39.960\n Just stuff when you look back, it just makes you smile.\n\n1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:44.960\n No, so I'll tell you about the most satisfying\n\n1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:46.640\n tournament victory of my career.\n\n1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:51.640\n So that was the Norwegian championship under 11 in 2000.\n\n1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:55.840\n Before that tournament, I was super anxious\n\n1:55:56.800 --> 1:56:00.000\n because I started like kind of late at chess.\n\n1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.720\n I played my first tournament when I was eight and a half.\n\n1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:05.080\n And a lot of my competitors had already played\n\n1:56:05.080 --> 1:56:09.040\n for a couple of years or even three, four years\n\n1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:10.440\n at that point.\n\n1:56:10.440 --> 1:56:12.040\n And the first time I,\n\n1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:15.360\n so I played the under 11 championship in 99.\n\n1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:18.040\n I was like a little over the middle of the pack.\n\n1:56:18.040 --> 1:56:20.000\n I'd never played against any of them before.\n\n1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:22.120\n So I didn't know what to expect at all.\n\n1:56:22.120 --> 1:56:23.720\n And then over the next year,\n\n1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:26.680\n I was just like edging a little bit closer.\n\n1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:28.720\n In each tournament, I felt like I was getting\n\n1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:29.960\n a little bit better.\n\n1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:32.520\n And when we had the championship,\n\n1:56:32.520 --> 1:56:34.520\n I knew that I was ready,\n\n1:56:34.520 --> 1:56:38.800\n that I was now at the same level of the best players.\n\n1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:41.240\n I was so anxious to show it.\n\n1:56:41.240 --> 1:56:42.840\n I remember I was just,\n\n1:56:42.840 --> 1:56:45.560\n the feeling of excitement and nervousness\n\n1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:47.840\n before the tournament was incredible.\n\n1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:51.520\n The tournament was weird because I started out,\n\n1:56:51.520 --> 1:56:54.080\n I gave away a draw to a weaker player,\n\n1:56:56.280 --> 1:56:57.920\n whom I shouldn't have drawn to.\n\n1:56:57.920 --> 1:57:00.200\n And then I drew against the other guy\n\n1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:05.560\n who was clearly like the best or second best.\n\n1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:08.400\n And at that point, I thought it was over\n\n1:57:08.400 --> 1:57:12.840\n because I thought he wouldn't give away points to others.\n\n1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:16.120\n And then the very next day he lost to somebody.\n\n1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:18.280\n So then the rest of the tournament,\n\n1:57:18.280 --> 1:57:19.200\n it was just like,\n\n1:57:19.200 --> 1:57:21.960\n I was always like playing my game and watching his.\n\n1:57:21.960 --> 1:57:24.680\n And we both won the rest of our games,\n\n1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:27.080\n but it meant that I was half a point ahead.\n\n1:57:27.080 --> 1:57:30.600\n Like the feeling when I realized that I was gonna win,\n\n1:57:32.320 --> 1:57:34.280\n that was just so amazing.\n\n1:57:34.280 --> 1:57:39.280\n It was like the first time that I was the best at my age.\n\n1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:43.720\n And at that point.\n\n1:57:43.720 --> 1:57:44.560\n You were hooked.\n\n1:57:44.560 --> 1:57:46.200\n Yeah, at that point I realized,\n\n1:57:48.240 --> 1:57:49.840\n I could actually be very good at this.\n\n1:57:49.840 --> 1:57:51.800\n So you kind of saw,\n\n1:57:51.800 --> 1:57:53.680\n what did you think your ceiling would be?\n\n1:57:53.680 --> 1:57:57.320\n Did you see that one day you could be the number one?\n\n1:57:57.320 --> 1:57:59.760\n No, I didn't think that was possible at all.\n\n1:58:01.160 --> 1:58:02.000\n But.\n\n1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:02.840\n When did you first?\n\n1:58:02.840 --> 1:58:05.160\n I could be the best in Norway.\n\n1:58:05.160 --> 1:58:06.120\n The best in Norway?\n\n1:58:06.120 --> 1:58:07.040\n At that point.\n\n1:58:07.040 --> 1:58:07.880\n When did you first?\n\n1:58:07.880 --> 1:58:09.960\n Because like I started relatively late.\n\n1:58:09.960 --> 1:58:10.800\n Right, so yeah.\n\n1:58:10.800 --> 1:58:12.200\n And also like,\n\n1:58:14.240 --> 1:58:17.000\n I knew that I studied a lot more than the others.\n\n1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:19.720\n I knew that I had a passion that they didn't have.\n\n1:58:19.720 --> 1:58:23.720\n They saw chess as something like,\n\n1:58:24.800 --> 1:58:26.600\n it was a hobby.\n\n1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:27.920\n It was like an activity.\n\n1:58:27.920 --> 1:58:32.080\n It was like going to football practice\n\n1:58:32.080 --> 1:58:34.040\n or any other sports.\n\n1:58:34.040 --> 1:58:35.040\n Like you go,\n\n1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:37.480\n you practice like once or twice a week,\n\n1:58:37.480 --> 1:58:39.480\n and then you play a tournament at the weekend.\n\n1:58:39.480 --> 1:58:41.120\n That's what you did.\n\n1:58:41.120 --> 1:58:42.480\n For me, it wasn't like that.\n\n1:58:42.480 --> 1:58:46.000\n Like I would go with my books and my board\n\n1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:47.800\n every day after school.\n\n1:58:49.240 --> 1:58:52.360\n And I would just constantly\n\n1:58:53.320 --> 1:58:55.640\n be trying to learn new things.\n\n1:58:55.640 --> 1:58:59.400\n I had like two hours of internet time\n\n1:58:59.400 --> 1:59:01.040\n on the computer each week.\n\n1:59:01.040 --> 1:59:03.680\n And I would always spend them on chess.\n\n1:59:04.880 --> 1:59:09.880\n Like I think before I was 13 or 14,\n\n1:59:10.520 --> 1:59:15.280\n I'd never opened a browser\n\n1:59:15.280 --> 1:59:17.680\n for any other reason than to play chess.\n\n1:59:19.160 --> 1:59:22.000\n Would you describe that as love or as obsession\n\n1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:23.880\n or something in between?\n\n1:59:23.880 --> 1:59:24.960\n It's everything?\n\n1:59:24.960 --> 1:59:25.800\n Yeah, everything.\n\n1:59:25.800 --> 1:59:30.360\n Yeah, everything, so I mean,\n\n1:59:30.360 --> 1:59:32.560\n it wasn't hard for me to tell at that point\n\n1:59:32.560 --> 1:59:36.480\n that I had something that the other kids didn't\n\n1:59:36.480 --> 1:59:41.040\n because I was never the one to grasp something\n\n1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:41.960\n very, very quickly.\n\n1:59:41.960 --> 1:59:44.160\n But once I started, I always got hooked\n\n1:59:44.160 --> 1:59:46.240\n and then I never stopped learning.\n\n1:59:46.240 --> 1:59:47.320\n What would you say,\n\n1:59:47.320 --> 1:59:49.280\n you've talked about the middle game\n\n1:59:49.280 --> 1:59:52.640\n as a place where you can play pure chess.\n\n1:59:52.640 --> 1:59:56.320\n What do you think is beautiful to you about chess?\n\n1:59:56.320 --> 1:59:58.560\n Like the thing when you were 11.\n\n1:59:58.560 --> 2:00:01.880\n What is beautiful to me is when your opponent\n\n2:00:01.880 --> 2:00:04.320\n can predict every single one of your moves\n\n2:00:04.320 --> 2:00:05.320\n and they still lose.\n\n2:00:06.200 --> 2:00:07.120\n How does that happen?\n\n2:00:07.120 --> 2:00:10.680\n No, like it means that at some point early,\n\n2:00:10.680 --> 2:00:14.160\n your planning, your evaluation has been better.\n\n2:00:14.160 --> 2:00:17.200\n So that you play just very simply, very clearly.\n\n2:00:17.200 --> 2:00:19.960\n It looks like you did nothing special\n\n2:00:19.960 --> 2:00:22.320\n and your opponent lost without a chance.\n\n2:00:22.320 --> 2:00:24.720\n So you're, how do you think about that?\n\n2:00:24.720 --> 2:00:26.680\n By the way, are you basically narrowed down\n\n2:00:26.680 --> 2:00:29.200\n this gigantic tree of options\n\n2:00:29.200 --> 2:00:32.880\n to where your opponent has less and less and less options\n\n2:00:32.880 --> 2:00:35.400\n to win, to escape, and then they're trapped.\n\n2:00:35.400 --> 2:00:36.240\n That's it.\n\n2:00:36.240 --> 2:00:37.640\n Essentially.\n\n2:00:37.640 --> 2:00:40.080\n Is there some aspect to the patterns themselves,\n\n2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:44.080\n to the positions, to the elegance of like\n\n2:00:45.600 --> 2:00:48.800\n the dynamics of the game that you just find beautiful\n\n2:00:48.800 --> 2:00:52.840\n that doesn't, that where you forget about the opponent?\n\n2:00:53.960 --> 2:00:58.280\n General, I try and create harmony on the board.\n\n2:00:58.280 --> 2:01:01.680\n Like what I would usually find harmonious is that\n\n2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:07.560\n the pieces work together, that they protect each other\n\n2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:13.640\n and that there are no pieces that are suboptimally placed.\n\n2:01:13.640 --> 2:01:17.000\n Or if they are suboptimally placed,\n\n2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:19.080\n they can be improved pretty easily.\n\n2:01:19.080 --> 2:01:23.320\n Like I hate when I have one piece that I know\n\n2:01:23.320 --> 2:01:26.000\n is badly placed and I can't improve it.\n\n2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.840\n When, yeah, when you're thinking about the harmony\n\n2:01:28.840 --> 2:01:30.560\n of the pieces, when you're looking at the position,\n\n2:01:30.560 --> 2:01:35.560\n you're evaluating it, are you looking at the whole board\n\n2:01:36.760 --> 2:01:41.760\n or is it like a bunch of groupings of pieces overlapping?\n\n2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:44.480\n I would like dancing together kind of thing.\n\n2:01:44.480 --> 2:01:47.320\n I would say it's more of the latter\n\n2:01:47.320 --> 2:01:50.600\n that would be more precise that you look.\n\n2:01:50.600 --> 2:01:55.000\n I mean, I look mostly closer to the middle,\n\n2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:57.640\n but then I would focus on one,\n\n2:01:57.640 --> 2:02:00.080\n like there are usually like one grouping of pieces\n\n2:02:00.080 --> 2:02:04.520\n on one side and then some more closer to the other side.\n\n2:02:04.520 --> 2:02:08.280\n So I would think of it a little bit that way.\n\n2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:11.920\n So, and everything's kind of gravitating to the middle.\n\n2:02:11.920 --> 2:02:13.920\n If it's going well, then yes.\n\n2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:15.160\n And in harmony.\n\n2:02:15.160 --> 2:02:16.640\n Yeah, in harmony.\n\n2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:20.200\n Or like if you can control the middle,\n\n2:02:20.200 --> 2:02:23.000\n you can more easily attack on both sides.\n\n2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:26.720\n That applies to pretty much any game.\n\n2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:27.640\n It's as simple as that.\n\n2:02:27.640 --> 2:02:32.640\n And like attacking on one side without control of the middle\n\n2:02:32.760 --> 2:02:37.560\n would feel very nonharmonious for me.\n\n2:02:37.560 --> 2:02:40.040\n Like I talked about the 10th game\n\n2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:43.640\n in the World Championship.\n\n2:02:43.640 --> 2:02:45.920\n Like that's the time I was the most nervous.\n\n2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:50.040\n And it was because it was the kind of attack that I hate\n\n2:02:50.040 --> 2:02:53.480\n where you just have to, you're abandoned one side\n\n2:02:53.480 --> 2:02:56.800\n and the attack has to work.\n\n2:02:57.640 --> 2:03:00.080\n There was one side and part of the middle as well,\n\n2:03:00.080 --> 2:03:01.880\n which I didn't control at all.\n\n2:03:01.880 --> 2:03:05.640\n And that's like the opposite of harmony for me.\n\n2:03:05.640 --> 2:03:10.520\n What advice would you give to chess players\n\n2:03:10.520 --> 2:03:14.560\n of different levels, how to improve in chess?\n\n2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:16.920\n Very beginner, complete beginner.\n\n2:03:16.920 --> 2:03:19.800\n I mean, at every level, is there something you can say?\n\n2:03:19.800 --> 2:03:21.760\n It's very hard for me to say.\n\n2:03:21.760 --> 2:03:26.540\n Because I mean, the easiest way is like love chess,\n\n2:03:26.540 --> 2:03:28.080\n be obsessed.\n\n2:03:28.080 --> 2:03:29.320\n Well, that's a really important statement.\n\n2:03:29.320 --> 2:03:31.920\n But that doesn't work for everybody.\n\n2:03:31.920 --> 2:03:34.600\n So I feel like it can feel like a grind.\n\n2:03:34.600 --> 2:03:37.560\n So you're saying the less it can feel like a grind,\n\n2:03:37.560 --> 2:03:40.800\n the better, at least for you.\n\n2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:41.640\n That's for sure.\n\n2:03:41.640 --> 2:03:46.600\n But I'm also very, very skeptical about giving advice\n\n2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:50.920\n because I think, again, my way only works\n\n2:03:50.920 --> 2:03:55.920\n if you have some combination of talent and obsession.\n\n2:03:56.280 --> 2:03:59.600\n So I'm not sure that I'd generally recommend it.\n\n2:03:59.600 --> 2:04:02.920\n Like what I've done doesn't go with\n\n2:04:02.920 --> 2:04:06.520\n what most coaches suggest for their kids.\n\n2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:09.720\n I've been lucky that I've had coaches from early on\n\n2:04:09.720 --> 2:04:11.840\n that have been very, very hands off\n\n2:04:11.840 --> 2:04:14.660\n and just allowed me to do my thing, basically.\n\n2:04:16.040 --> 2:04:17.120\n Well, there's a lot to be said\n\n2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:20.520\n about cultivating the obsession.\n\n2:04:21.440 --> 2:04:24.700\n Like really letting that flourish\n\n2:04:24.700 --> 2:04:26.920\n to where you spend a lot of hours\n\n2:04:28.080 --> 2:04:29.760\n like with the chessboard in your head\n\n2:04:29.760 --> 2:04:31.760\n and it doesn't feel like a struggle.\n\n2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:35.920\n No, so like just letting me do my thing.\n\n2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:37.280\n Like if you give me a bunch of work,\n\n2:04:37.280 --> 2:04:38.520\n it will probably feel like a chore.\n\n2:04:38.520 --> 2:04:39.620\n And if you don't give me,\n\n2:04:39.620 --> 2:04:42.920\n I will spend all of that time on my own\n\n2:04:42.920 --> 2:04:45.160\n without thinking that it's work\n\n2:04:45.160 --> 2:04:49.760\n or without thought that I'm doing this to improve my chess.\n\n2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:52.200\n Well, in terms of learning stuff, like books,\n\n2:04:52.200 --> 2:04:56.280\n there's one thing that's relatively novel\n\n2:04:56.280 --> 2:04:58.120\n from your perspective that people are starting now\n\n2:04:58.120 --> 2:04:59.040\n is there's YouTube.\n\n2:04:59.040 --> 2:05:00.920\n There's a lot of good YouTubers.\n\n2:05:00.920 --> 2:05:02.840\n You're a part time YouTuber.\n\n2:05:02.840 --> 2:05:04.360\n You have stuff on YouTube, I guess.\n\n2:05:04.360 --> 2:05:06.900\n Yeah, I have, but if you've seen my YouTube,\n\n2:05:06.900 --> 2:05:10.560\n it's mostly like, it's carefree.\n\n2:05:10.560 --> 2:05:13.040\n It's generally not high effort content.\n\n2:05:13.040 --> 2:05:16.540\n Yeah, but do you like any particular YouTubers?\n\n2:05:17.580 --> 2:05:19.480\n I could just recommend like stuff I've seen.\n\n2:05:19.480 --> 2:05:23.740\n So Aged Madar, Gotham Chess, Botez Live.\n\n2:05:25.060 --> 2:05:27.680\n I really like St. Louis Chess Club,\n\n2:05:27.680 --> 2:05:32.200\n Daniel Narodetsky, and John Bartholomew.\n\n2:05:32.200 --> 2:05:33.040\n Those are good channels,\n\n2:05:33.040 --> 2:05:34.720\n but is there something you can recommend?\n\n2:05:34.720 --> 2:05:36.280\n No, all of them are good.\n\n2:05:37.400 --> 2:05:41.880\n You know, the best recommendation I could give\n\n2:05:41.880 --> 2:05:45.560\n is Aged Madar, purely.\n\n2:05:45.560 --> 2:05:47.120\n How much did he pay you to say that?\n\n2:05:47.120 --> 2:05:51.200\n No, so the thing about that is that I haven't really,\n\n2:05:51.200 --> 2:05:53.560\n I have, so I can tell you I've never watched\n\n2:05:53.560 --> 2:05:56.800\n any of his videos from start to finish.\n\n2:05:56.800 --> 2:05:59.960\n I'm not like, I'm not the target audience, obviously.\n\n2:05:59.960 --> 2:06:03.840\n But I think the only chess YouTube video\n\n2:06:03.840 --> 2:06:07.080\n that my dad has ever watched from start to finish\n\n2:06:07.080 --> 2:06:11.080\n is Aged Madar, and he said, like,\n\n2:06:11.080 --> 2:06:12.300\n I watched one of his videos,\n\n2:06:12.300 --> 2:06:14.600\n I wanted to know what it was all about,\n\n2:06:14.600 --> 2:06:19.040\n because I think Aged Madar is like the same strength\n\n2:06:19.040 --> 2:06:21.200\n as my father, or maybe just a little bit weaker,\n\n2:06:21.200 --> 2:06:23.280\n like 1900 or something.\n\n2:06:23.280 --> 2:06:25.720\n My father is probably about 2000.\n\n2:06:25.720 --> 2:06:28.120\n And my father has played chess his whole life.\n\n2:06:28.120 --> 2:06:30.200\n He loves, he absolutely loves the game.\n\n2:06:30.200 --> 2:06:32.960\n It was like, that's the only time he's actually sat through\n\n2:06:32.960 --> 2:06:34.880\n one of those videos, and he said, like,\n\n2:06:34.880 --> 2:06:36.560\n yeah, I get it, I enjoy it.\n\n2:06:36.560 --> 2:06:39.360\n So that's the best recommendation I could give.\n\n2:06:39.360 --> 2:06:43.440\n That's the only channel that my father actually enjoys.\n\n2:06:44.280 --> 2:06:45.120\n This is hilarious.\n\n2:06:45.120 --> 2:06:47.360\n I talked to him before this to ask him\n\n2:06:47.360 --> 2:06:48.960\n if he has any questions for you.\n\n2:06:48.960 --> 2:06:52.040\n And he said, no, just do your thing, you know.\n\n2:06:52.040 --> 2:06:54.800\n No, he's so careful, he wouldn't do that.\n\n2:06:54.800 --> 2:06:59.600\n He did mention jokingly about Evan's Gambit, I think.\n\n2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:00.440\n Is that a thing?\n\n2:07:00.440 --> 2:07:01.420\n Evan's Gambit?\n\n2:07:01.420 --> 2:07:03.080\n It's some weird thing he made up.\n\n2:07:03.080 --> 2:07:04.640\n It might be an inside joke.\n\n2:07:04.640 --> 2:07:06.720\n I don't know, but he asked me to.\n\n2:07:06.720 --> 2:07:07.640\n Well, anyway.\n\n2:07:07.640 --> 2:07:10.200\n Yeah, I didn't even get the...\n\n2:07:10.200 --> 2:07:11.860\n It's something he made up.\n\n2:07:11.860 --> 2:07:15.120\n I didn't even realize that he plays the Evan's Gambit.\n\n2:07:15.120 --> 2:07:17.040\n Like, he plays a lot of Gambits that are...\n\n2:07:17.040 --> 2:07:18.380\n Wait, Evan's Gambit is a thing?\n\n2:07:18.380 --> 2:07:19.400\n Yeah, yeah, that's a thing.\n\n2:07:19.400 --> 2:07:22.600\n Like, that's an old opening from the 1800s.\n\n2:07:22.600 --> 2:07:25.160\n Captain Evans apparently invented it.\n\n2:07:25.160 --> 2:07:26.640\n Why would he mention that particular one?\n\n2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:27.480\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n2:07:27.480 --> 2:07:28.940\n Is there something hilarious about that one?\n\n2:07:28.940 --> 2:07:29.780\n I don't know.\n\n2:07:29.780 --> 2:07:34.360\n I don't think I've ever faced the Evan's Gambit in a game.\n\n2:07:34.360 --> 2:07:37.000\n I feel like both of you are trolling me right now.\n\n2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:42.000\n But I mean, he's played a lot of other Gambits.\n\n2:07:42.800 --> 2:07:45.440\n Maybe this is the one he wanted to mention.\n\n2:07:45.440 --> 2:07:48.880\n So this, maybe this is called the Evan's Gambit as well.\n\n2:07:48.880 --> 2:07:52.480\n But I just know it as like the 2G4 Gambit.\n\n2:07:52.480 --> 2:07:53.760\n Maybe this is the one.\n\n2:07:53.760 --> 2:07:57.880\n Like this one, he has played a bunch.\n\n2:08:00.520 --> 2:08:03.640\n And he's been telling me a lot about his games\n\n2:08:03.640 --> 2:08:04.480\n in this line.\n\n2:08:04.480 --> 2:08:06.480\n It's like, oh, it's not so bad.\n\n2:08:06.480 --> 2:08:08.960\n And I'm like, yeah, but you're a pawn down.\n\n2:08:08.960 --> 2:08:10.760\n Yeah, but I can sort of see it.\n\n2:08:10.760 --> 2:08:12.840\n I can sort of understand it.\n\n2:08:12.840 --> 2:08:15.560\n And he's like, he's proud of the fact\n\n2:08:15.560 --> 2:08:17.760\n that nobody like told him to play this line or anything.\n\n2:08:17.760 --> 2:08:19.920\n He came up with it himself.\n\n2:08:19.920 --> 2:08:23.080\n And there's this, I'll tell you another story\n\n2:08:23.080 --> 2:08:23.920\n about my father.\n\n2:08:23.920 --> 2:08:26.840\n So there's this line that I call,\n\n2:08:26.840 --> 2:08:28.760\n that I called the Henry Carlson line.\n\n2:08:31.760 --> 2:08:34.120\n So at some point, you know,\n\n2:08:34.120 --> 2:08:36.280\n he never knew a lot of openings in chess,\n\n2:08:36.280 --> 2:08:40.960\n but I taught him a couple of openings as black.\n\n2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:45.460\n It's the, it's the Sveshnikov's Sicilian\n\n2:08:45.460 --> 2:08:48.200\n that I played a lot myself also\n\n2:08:48.200 --> 2:08:52.280\n during the world championship in 2018.\n\n2:08:52.280 --> 2:08:55.040\n I won a bunch of games in 2019 as well.\n\n2:08:55.040 --> 2:08:55.880\n So that's one opening.\n\n2:08:55.880 --> 2:08:57.040\n And I also taught him as black\n\n2:08:57.040 --> 2:08:58.680\n to play the Rogozin defense.\n\n2:08:59.960 --> 2:09:02.920\n And then, so the Rogozin defense goes like,\n\n2:09:02.920 --> 2:09:04.160\n goes like this.\n\n2:09:05.160 --> 2:09:08.880\n It's characterized by this bishop move.\n\n2:09:10.680 --> 2:09:14.200\n And so he would play those openings pretty,\n\n2:09:14.200 --> 2:09:16.120\n pretty exclusively as black\n\n2:09:16.120 --> 2:09:17.720\n in the tournaments that he did play.\n\n2:09:17.720 --> 2:09:20.720\n And also the Sveshnikov Sicilian is like,\n\n2:09:20.720 --> 2:09:23.760\n that's the only, two of my sisters play,\n\n2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:26.040\n have played a bunch of chess tournaments as well.\n\n2:09:26.040 --> 2:09:28.960\n And that's the only opening they know as well.\n\n2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:32.240\n So my family's portrait is very narrow.\n\n2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:35.560\n So, so this is the, this is the system.\n\n2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:37.960\n Black goes here and then we all from white takes the pawn\n\n2:09:37.960 --> 2:09:39.200\n and black takes the pawn.\n\n2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:43.720\n So at some point I was watching one of my,\n\n2:09:43.720 --> 2:09:47.440\n my father's online blitz game, blitz game.\n\n2:09:47.440 --> 2:09:52.440\n And as white, he played this, this.\n\n2:09:52.440 --> 2:09:54.320\n So this is called the Karkhan defense.\n\n2:09:54.320 --> 2:09:55.520\n He took the pawn.\n\n2:09:58.160 --> 2:10:00.560\n It was taken back, then he went with the knight.\n\n2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:05.280\n His opponent went here and then he played a bishop here.\n\n2:10:05.280 --> 2:10:08.240\n So I, I'd never seen this opening before.\n\n2:10:08.240 --> 2:10:13.240\n And I was like, wow, how on earth did he come up with that?\n\n2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:15.360\n And he said, no, I just played the Rogozin\n\n2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:16.520\n with the different colors\n\n2:10:16.520 --> 2:10:18.000\n because if the knight was here,\n\n2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:19.640\n it would be the same position.\n\n2:10:19.640 --> 2:10:22.080\n I was like, I never, I was like,\n\n2:10:22.080 --> 2:10:27.080\n how, how am I like one of the best players in the world?\n\n2:10:27.200 --> 2:10:28.960\n And I've never thought about that.\n\n2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:30.800\n So I actually started playing,\n\n2:10:30.800 --> 2:10:34.080\n I started playing this line as white\n\n2:10:34.080 --> 2:10:36.560\n with pretty decent result and then results.\n\n2:10:36.560 --> 2:10:39.400\n And it actually became kind of popular\n\n2:10:39.400 --> 2:10:42.680\n and everybody who asked about the line,\n\n2:10:42.680 --> 2:10:43.680\n it's like, I would always tell them,\n\n2:10:43.680 --> 2:10:45.960\n yeah, that's the Henry Carlson.\n\n2:10:45.960 --> 2:10:48.280\n I wouldn't necessarily explain why it was called that.\n\n2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:50.080\n I would just always call it that.\n\n2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:52.960\n So I really hope at this point, at some point,\n\n2:10:52.960 --> 2:10:56.680\n this line will be, will find its rightful name.\n\n2:10:56.680 --> 2:10:59.920\n In the, yeah, finds its way into the history books.\n\n2:10:59.920 --> 2:11:02.760\n Can you, what, what, what'd you learn about life\n\n2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:03.880\n from your dad?\n\n2:11:03.880 --> 2:11:06.080\n What role has your dad played in your life?\n\n2:11:08.360 --> 2:11:11.640\n He's taught me a lot of things, but most of all,\n\n2:11:11.640 --> 2:11:15.080\n as long as you win a chess, then everything else is fine.\n\n2:11:15.080 --> 2:11:20.080\n I think my, especially my father,\n\n2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:23.400\n but my parents in general, they,\n\n2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:28.120\n they always wanted me to get a good education\n\n2:11:28.120 --> 2:11:31.920\n and find a job and so on.\n\n2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:33.240\n Even though my father loves chess\n\n2:11:33.240 --> 2:11:35.080\n and he wanted me to play chess,\n\n2:11:35.080 --> 2:11:40.080\n I don't think he had any plans for me to be professional.\n\n2:11:40.080 --> 2:11:42.680\n I think things changed at some point.\n\n2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:46.440\n Like I was less and less interested in school\n\n2:11:46.440 --> 2:11:51.440\n and for a long time, we were kind of going back and forth,\n\n2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:54.280\n fighting about that, especially my father,\n\n2:11:54.280 --> 2:11:56.200\n but also my mother a little bit.\n\n2:11:56.200 --> 2:11:58.440\n It was at times a little bit difficult.\n\n2:11:58.440 --> 2:11:59.760\n They wanted you to go to school.\n\n2:11:59.760 --> 2:12:02.840\n Yeah, they sort of wanted me to do more school\n\n2:12:02.840 --> 2:12:04.160\n to have more options.\n\n2:12:04.160 --> 2:12:07.200\n And then I think at some point,\n\n2:12:07.200 --> 2:12:11.720\n they just gave up, but I think that sort of coincided\n\n2:12:11.720 --> 2:12:13.560\n when I was actually starting to make real money\n\n2:12:13.560 --> 2:12:14.400\n off tournaments.\n\n2:12:14.400 --> 2:12:18.840\n And after that, you know, everything's been sort of easy\n\n2:12:18.840 --> 2:12:21.040\n and like terms of the family,\n\n2:12:21.040 --> 2:12:26.040\n like they've never put any pressure on me\n\n2:12:26.040 --> 2:12:29.080\n or they've never put any demands on me.\n\n2:12:29.080 --> 2:12:31.240\n There's just, yeah, my ass has to focus on chess.\n\n2:12:31.240 --> 2:12:34.960\n That's that, that's the thing.\n\n2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:38.800\n That's, that's, that's it.\n\n2:12:38.800 --> 2:12:41.400\n Like, I think they taught me in general\n\n2:12:41.400 --> 2:12:43.920\n to be curious about the world\n\n2:12:43.920 --> 2:12:48.920\n and to get a decent general education,\n\n2:12:49.240 --> 2:12:51.240\n not necessarily from school,\n\n2:12:51.240 --> 2:12:55.720\n but like just knowing about the world around you\n\n2:12:55.720 --> 2:12:58.240\n and knowing history and being, you know,\n\n2:12:58.240 --> 2:13:01.200\n just being interested in society.\n\n2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:04.960\n I think in that sense, they've done well.\n\n2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:07.880\n And he's been with you throughout your chess career.\n\n2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:12.880\n I mean, there's something to be said about just family,\n\n2:13:12.920 --> 2:13:16.000\n support and love that you have that, you know,\n\n2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:18.920\n this world is a lonely place.\n\n2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:21.440\n It's good to have people around you that are like,\n\n2:13:21.440 --> 2:13:24.200\n yeah, they got your back kind of, you know?\n\n2:13:24.200 --> 2:13:25.040\n Yeah.\n\n2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:29.040\n It's a cliche, but I think to some extent,\n\n2:13:29.040 --> 2:13:32.240\n all the people you surround yourself with,\n\n2:13:34.680 --> 2:13:36.760\n they can help you a lot.\n\n2:13:36.760 --> 2:13:41.080\n It's only family that only has their own interests at heart.\n\n2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:45.440\n And so for that reason, like my father's like the only one\n\n2:13:45.440 --> 2:13:49.040\n that's been like constantly in the team\n\n2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:51.360\n that he's always been around.\n\n2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:54.160\n And it's for that reason that I know he has my back,\n\n2:13:54.160 --> 2:13:55.000\n no matter what.\n\n2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:58.920\n Now there's a cliche question here,\n\n2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:03.800\n but let's try to actually get to some deep truth perhaps.\n\n2:14:03.800 --> 2:14:06.280\n But people who don't know much about chess\n\n2:14:06.280 --> 2:14:08.840\n seem to like to use chess as a metaphor\n\n2:14:08.840 --> 2:14:10.720\n for everything in life.\n\n2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:14.520\n But there is some aspect to the decision making\n\n2:14:14.520 --> 2:14:16.440\n to the kind of reasoning involved in chess\n\n2:14:16.440 --> 2:14:19.160\n that's transferable to other things.\n\n2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:23.620\n Can you speak to that in your own life and in general?\n\n2:14:23.620 --> 2:14:27.940\n Like the kind of reasoning involved with chess,\n\n2:14:27.940 --> 2:14:32.460\n how much does that transfer to life out there?\n\n2:14:32.460 --> 2:14:34.940\n It just helps you make decisions.\n\n2:14:34.940 --> 2:14:36.100\n Of all kinds.\n\n2:14:36.100 --> 2:14:38.260\n Yeah, that would be my main takeaway.\n\n2:14:38.260 --> 2:14:40.940\n That you learn to make informed guesses\n\n2:14:40.940 --> 2:14:42.640\n in a limited amount of time.\n\n2:14:43.820 --> 2:14:47.300\n I mean, does it frustrate you when you have\n\n2:14:47.300 --> 2:14:49.340\n geopolitical thinkers and leaders?\n\n2:14:49.340 --> 2:14:51.980\n You know, Henry Kissinger will often talk about\n\n2:14:51.980 --> 2:14:55.780\n geopolitics as a game of chess or 3D chess.\n\n2:14:55.780 --> 2:14:58.300\n Is that too oversimplified of a projection?\n\n2:14:58.300 --> 2:15:02.260\n Or do you think that the kind of deliberations\n\n2:15:02.260 --> 2:15:04.860\n you have on the world stage is similar\n\n2:15:04.860 --> 2:15:08.660\n to the kind of decision making you have on the chessboard?\n\n2:15:08.660 --> 2:15:11.580\n Well, I'm never trying to get reelected\n\n2:15:11.580 --> 2:15:13.060\n when I play a game of chess.\n\n2:15:14.780 --> 2:15:16.820\n There's no special interest, you have to get happy.\n\n2:15:16.820 --> 2:15:18.940\n Yeah, that kind of helps.\n\n2:15:18.940 --> 2:15:23.060\n No, I can understand that.\n\n2:15:23.060 --> 2:15:25.580\n Obviously, for every action, there's a reaction\n\n2:15:25.580 --> 2:15:29.740\n and you have to calculate far ahead.\n\n2:15:29.740 --> 2:15:31.620\n It probably would be a good thing\n\n2:15:31.620 --> 2:15:35.860\n if more big players on the international scene\n\n2:15:35.860 --> 2:15:40.140\n thought a little bit more like a chess player in that sense,\n\n2:15:40.140 --> 2:15:42.460\n like trying to make good decision\n\n2:15:42.460 --> 2:15:46.420\n based on limited amount of data,\n\n2:15:46.420 --> 2:15:49.660\n rather than thinking about other factors,\n\n2:15:49.660 --> 2:15:51.140\n but it's so tough.\n\n2:15:51.140 --> 2:15:55.300\n But it does annoy me when people make moves\n\n2:15:55.300 --> 2:15:58.260\n that they know are wrong for different reasons.\n\n2:15:58.260 --> 2:16:00.460\n And they should know, if they did some calculation,\n\n2:16:00.460 --> 2:16:01.300\n they should know they're wrong.\n\n2:16:01.300 --> 2:16:04.620\n Yeah, exactly, that they should know that are wrong.\n\n2:16:04.620 --> 2:16:08.940\n And so much politics is like,\n\n2:16:08.940 --> 2:16:13.300\n it's, you're often asked to do something\n\n2:16:13.300 --> 2:16:17.340\n when it would be much better to do nothing.\n\n2:16:18.940 --> 2:16:21.900\n Like, no, but that happens in chess all the time,\n\n2:16:21.900 --> 2:16:24.060\n like you have a choice.\n\n2:16:24.060 --> 2:16:28.540\n Like I often tell people that in certain situations,\n\n2:16:28.540 --> 2:16:29.820\n you should not try and win,\n\n2:16:29.820 --> 2:16:32.660\n you should just let your opponent lose.\n\n2:16:32.660 --> 2:16:36.020\n And that happens in politics all the time.\n\n2:16:37.540 --> 2:16:40.540\n But yeah, just let your opponents\n\n2:16:40.540 --> 2:16:42.500\n continue whatever they're doing,\n\n2:16:42.500 --> 2:16:43.340\n and then you'll win.\n\n2:16:43.340 --> 2:16:45.740\n Don't try to do something just to do something.\n\n2:16:45.740 --> 2:16:50.380\n Often, they say in chess that having a bad plan\n\n2:16:50.380 --> 2:16:52.380\n is better than having no plan.\n\n2:16:52.380 --> 2:16:53.860\n It's absolute nonsense.\n\n2:16:55.100 --> 2:16:56.460\n I forget what General said it,\n\n2:16:56.460 --> 2:16:59.980\n but it was like, don't interrupt your enemy\n\n2:16:59.980 --> 2:17:02.020\n when they're making a mistake.\n\n2:17:02.020 --> 2:17:02.860\n I think they're...\n\n2:17:02.860 --> 2:17:07.860\n Also, Petrosian, the former world champion said,\n\n2:17:09.460 --> 2:17:11.940\n when your opponent wants to play Dutch defense,\n\n2:17:11.940 --> 2:17:13.420\n don't stop them.\n\n2:17:13.420 --> 2:17:16.220\n I mean, chess players will know that it's the same thing.\n\n2:17:16.220 --> 2:17:19.780\n I mean, chess players will know that it's the same thing.\n\n2:17:19.780 --> 2:17:21.180\n Actually, this reminds me,\n\n2:17:22.580 --> 2:17:24.060\n is there something you found really impressive\n\n2:17:24.060 --> 2:17:26.180\n about Queen's Gambit, the TV show?\n\n2:17:26.180 --> 2:17:28.140\n You know, that's one of the things that really captivated\n\n2:17:28.140 --> 2:17:30.220\n the public imagination about chess.\n\n2:17:30.220 --> 2:17:32.500\n People who don't play chess became very curious\n\n2:17:32.500 --> 2:17:35.100\n about the game, about the beauty of the game,\n\n2:17:35.100 --> 2:17:37.100\n the drama of the game, all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:17:37.100 --> 2:17:38.900\n Is there, in terms of accuracy,\n\n2:17:38.900 --> 2:17:41.260\n in terms of the actual games played,\n\n2:17:41.260 --> 2:17:44.300\n that you found impressive?\n\n2:17:44.300 --> 2:17:46.980\n First of all, they did the chess well,\n\n2:17:46.980 --> 2:17:48.260\n they did it accurately.\n\n2:17:48.260 --> 2:17:51.740\n And also, they found actual games and positions\n\n2:17:51.740 --> 2:17:53.940\n that I'd never seen before.\n\n2:17:53.940 --> 2:17:55.140\n And it really captivated me.\n\n2:17:55.140 --> 2:17:59.500\n Like, I would not follow the story at times.\n\n2:17:59.500 --> 2:18:01.340\n I was just trying to, wow,\n\n2:18:01.340 --> 2:18:03.900\n where the hell did I find that game?\n\n2:18:03.900 --> 2:18:06.020\n Just trying to solve the positions.\n\n2:18:06.020 --> 2:18:09.380\n So, Beth Harmon, the main character,\n\n2:18:09.380 --> 2:18:13.340\n were you impressed by the play she was doing in the,\n\n2:18:13.340 --> 2:18:15.340\n like, was there a particular style\n\n2:18:15.340 --> 2:18:17.260\n that they developed consistently?\n\n2:18:17.260 --> 2:18:20.700\n She was just, at the end, she was just totally universal.\n\n2:18:20.700 --> 2:18:25.020\n Like, at the start, she was probably a bit too aggressive,\n\n2:18:25.020 --> 2:18:28.060\n but no, she was absolutely universal.\n\n2:18:28.060 --> 2:18:30.980\n Wait, what adjective are you using?\n\n2:18:30.980 --> 2:18:34.900\n Universal in the sense that she could play in any style.\n\n2:18:35.940 --> 2:18:37.020\n Oh, interesting.\n\n2:18:37.020 --> 2:18:38.820\n And was dominant in that way.\n\n2:18:38.820 --> 2:18:41.380\n So, wow, there was a development in style too\n\n2:18:41.380 --> 2:18:42.300\n throughout the show.\n\n2:18:42.300 --> 2:18:43.140\n Yeah, for sure.\n\n2:18:43.140 --> 2:18:44.620\n It's really interesting they did that.\n\n2:18:44.620 --> 2:18:45.860\n Yeah.\n\n2:18:45.860 --> 2:18:49.020\n And it actually happened with me a bit as well.\n\n2:18:49.020 --> 2:18:51.660\n Like, I started out really aggressive.\n\n2:18:51.660 --> 2:18:56.420\n Then I became probably too technical at some point,\n\n2:18:56.420 --> 2:18:58.180\n taking a little bit too few risks\n\n2:18:58.180 --> 2:19:00.020\n and not playing dynamic enough.\n\n2:19:00.020 --> 2:19:03.300\n And then I started to get a little bit better at dynamics\n\n2:19:03.300 --> 2:19:05.260\n so that now I'm,\n\n2:19:05.260 --> 2:19:07.820\n I would say definitely the most universal player\n\n2:19:07.820 --> 2:19:09.860\n in terms of style.\n\n2:19:11.060 --> 2:19:12.260\n Are there any skills in chess\n\n2:19:12.260 --> 2:19:14.340\n that are transferable to poker?\n\n2:19:14.340 --> 2:19:17.700\n So as you're playing around with poker a little bit now,\n\n2:19:17.700 --> 2:19:19.900\n how fundamentally different of a game is it?\n\n2:19:20.940 --> 2:19:24.300\n What I find the most transferable probably is\n\n2:19:24.300 --> 2:19:29.300\n not letting past decisions dictate future thinking.\n\n2:19:30.740 --> 2:19:32.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:19:32.380 --> 2:19:34.740\n But in terms of the patterns in the betting strategies\n\n2:19:34.740 --> 2:19:37.620\n and all that kind of stuff, what about bluffing?\n\n2:19:37.620 --> 2:19:39.660\n I bluff way too much.\n\n2:19:40.860 --> 2:19:42.420\n It does seem you enjoy bluffing\n\n2:19:42.420 --> 2:19:45.900\n and Daniel Negrano was saying that you're quite good at it.\n\n2:19:46.780 --> 2:19:49.580\n But yeah, it has very little material to go by.\n\n2:19:49.580 --> 2:19:50.660\n Sample size is small.\n\n2:19:50.660 --> 2:19:51.580\n Yeah.\n\n2:19:51.580 --> 2:19:53.300\n No, I mean, I enjoy bluffing\n\n2:19:53.300 --> 2:19:57.540\n for more of the gambling aspects, the thrill of.\n\n2:19:57.540 --> 2:19:59.700\n So not the technical aspect of the bluffing\n\n2:19:59.700 --> 2:20:01.940\n like you would on the chessboard?\n\n2:20:01.940 --> 2:20:05.460\n Not bluffing in the same sense, but there is some element.\n\n2:20:05.460 --> 2:20:09.100\n But I do enjoy it on the chessboard.\n\n2:20:09.100 --> 2:20:11.740\n Like if I know that like,\n\n2:20:11.740 --> 2:20:13.900\n oh, I successfully scared away my opponent\n\n2:20:13.900 --> 2:20:16.620\n from making the best move, that's of course satisfying.\n\n2:20:16.620 --> 2:20:20.820\n In that same way, it might be satisfying in poker, right?\n\n2:20:20.820 --> 2:20:22.460\n That you represent something,\n\n2:20:22.460 --> 2:20:25.180\n you scare away your opponent in the same kind of way.\n\n2:20:25.180 --> 2:20:27.540\n And also like you tell a story,\n\n2:20:27.540 --> 2:20:30.460\n you try and tell a story and then they believe it.\n\n2:20:30.460 --> 2:20:32.700\n Yeah, tell a story with your betting,\n\n2:20:32.700 --> 2:20:36.860\n with all the different other cues.\n\n2:20:36.860 --> 2:20:40.260\n Do you like the money aspect, the betting strategies?\n\n2:20:40.260 --> 2:20:43.300\n So it's almost like another layer on top of it, right?\n\n2:20:43.300 --> 2:20:48.300\n Like it's the uncertainty in the cards,\n\n2:20:49.820 --> 2:20:52.620\n but the betting, there's so much freedom to the betting.\n\n2:20:53.620 --> 2:20:54.580\n I'm not very good at that.\n\n2:20:54.580 --> 2:20:58.820\n So I cannot say that I understand it completely.\n\n2:20:58.820 --> 2:21:03.820\n You know, when it comes to different sizing and all that,\n\n2:21:04.020 --> 2:21:05.660\n I just haven't studied it enough.\n\n2:21:05.660 --> 2:21:08.340\n How much of luck is part of poker would you say\n\n2:21:08.340 --> 2:21:12.020\n from what you've seen versus skill?\n\n2:21:12.020 --> 2:21:15.340\n I mean, it's so different in the sense that you can be\n\n2:21:15.340 --> 2:21:16.620\n one of the best players in the world\n\n2:21:16.620 --> 2:21:18.620\n and lose two, three years in a row\n\n2:21:18.620 --> 2:21:23.820\n without that being like a massive outlier.\n\n2:21:23.820 --> 2:21:27.700\n Okay, the thing that more than one person told me\n\n2:21:27.700 --> 2:21:29.780\n that you're very good at is trash talking.\n\n2:21:31.260 --> 2:21:32.860\n I don't think I am.\n\n2:21:32.860 --> 2:21:37.860\n A lot of people who make those observations about me,\n\n2:21:38.460 --> 2:21:40.740\n I think they just expect very, very little.\n\n2:21:40.740 --> 2:21:44.940\n So they expect from the best chess player in the world,\n\n2:21:44.940 --> 2:21:49.500\n that just anything that's non robotic is interesting.\n\n2:21:50.620 --> 2:21:52.580\n Also, when it comes to trash talking,\n\n2:21:52.580 --> 2:21:54.540\n like I have the biggest advantage in the world\n\n2:21:54.540 --> 2:21:56.260\n that I'm the best at what I'm doing.\n\n2:21:56.260 --> 2:21:58.540\n So trash talking becomes very, very, very easy\n\n2:21:58.540 --> 2:21:59.980\n because I can back it up.\n\n2:21:59.980 --> 2:22:01.100\n Yeah.\n\n2:22:01.100 --> 2:22:04.020\n Yeah, but a lot of people that are extremely good at stuff\n\n2:22:04.020 --> 2:22:06.140\n don't trash talk and they're not good at it.\n\n2:22:06.140 --> 2:22:07.580\n I don't think I'm very good at it.\n\n2:22:07.580 --> 2:22:09.980\n It's just that I can back it up,\n\n2:22:09.980 --> 2:22:12.140\n which makes it seem that I'm better.\n\n2:22:12.140 --> 2:22:12.980\n And also.\n\n2:22:12.980 --> 2:22:14.780\n You're even doing it now.\n\n2:22:14.780 --> 2:22:19.020\n Also being non robotic or not completely robotic helps.\n\n2:22:19.020 --> 2:22:20.580\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:22:20.580 --> 2:22:22.460\n You're not trash talking, you're just stating facts.\n\n2:22:22.460 --> 2:22:23.420\n That's right.\n\n2:22:23.420 --> 2:22:28.340\n Have you ever considered that there will be trash talking\n\n2:22:28.340 --> 2:22:31.540\n and over the chess board and some of the big tournaments,\n\n2:22:31.540 --> 2:22:34.780\n like adding that kind of component or even talking,\n\n2:22:34.780 --> 2:22:37.700\n you know, would that completely distract\n\n2:22:37.700 --> 2:22:38.860\n from the game of chess?\n\n2:22:38.860 --> 2:22:41.180\n No, I think it could be fun in,\n\n2:22:42.740 --> 2:22:44.500\n when people play off fan games,\n\n2:22:44.500 --> 2:22:46.300\n when they play Blitz games,\n\n2:22:46.300 --> 2:22:48.020\n like people trash talk all the time.\n\n2:22:48.020 --> 2:22:49.620\n It's a normal part of the game.\n\n2:22:49.620 --> 2:22:53.500\n So you emphasize fun a lot.\n\n2:22:53.500 --> 2:22:57.940\n Do you think we're living inside of a simulation\n\n2:22:57.940 --> 2:23:01.020\n that is trying to maximize fun?\n\n2:23:03.940 --> 2:23:08.820\n But that's only happened for the last 100 years or so.\n\n2:23:08.820 --> 2:23:10.420\n No, that's like the.\n\n2:23:10.420 --> 2:23:12.620\n Fun has always been increasing, I think.\n\n2:23:12.620 --> 2:23:13.460\n Yeah, okay.\n\n2:23:13.460 --> 2:23:14.300\n It's always been increasing,\n\n2:23:14.300 --> 2:23:16.860\n but I feel like it's been increasing exponentially.\n\n2:23:18.340 --> 2:23:19.180\n Yeah.\n\n2:23:19.180 --> 2:23:22.540\n I mean, or at least the importance of fun.\n\n2:23:22.540 --> 2:23:24.940\n But I guess it depends on the society as well.\n\n2:23:24.940 --> 2:23:29.740\n Like in the West, we've had such a Christian influence.\n\n2:23:29.740 --> 2:23:33.860\n And I mean, Christianity hasn't exactly embraced\n\n2:23:33.860 --> 2:23:37.260\n the concept of fun over time.\n\n2:23:37.260 --> 2:23:38.380\n Well, actually to push back,\n\n2:23:38.380 --> 2:23:40.540\n I think forbidding certain things\n\n2:23:40.540 --> 2:23:42.260\n kind of makes them more fun.\n\n2:23:42.260 --> 2:23:44.740\n So sometimes I think you need to say,\n\n2:23:44.740 --> 2:23:46.500\n you're not allowed to do this.\n\n2:23:46.500 --> 2:23:48.340\n And then a lot of people start doing it\n\n2:23:48.340 --> 2:23:49.700\n and then they have fun doing that\n\n2:23:49.700 --> 2:23:53.580\n because it's like it's doing a thing\n\n2:23:53.580 --> 2:23:55.500\n in the face of the resistance of the thing.\n\n2:23:55.500 --> 2:23:57.060\n So whenever there's resistance,\n\n2:23:57.060 --> 2:23:59.140\n that does somehow make it more fun.\n\n2:23:59.140 --> 2:24:02.420\n Oppressive regimes has always kind of been\n\n2:24:02.420 --> 2:24:04.140\n kind of good for comedy, no?\n\n2:24:04.140 --> 2:24:06.140\n Like, no, but I heard.\n\n2:24:06.140 --> 2:24:06.980\n Yes.\n\n2:24:06.980 --> 2:24:08.740\n Supposedly like in the Soviet Union,\n\n2:24:08.740 --> 2:24:09.860\n I don't know about fun,\n\n2:24:09.860 --> 2:24:13.660\n but supposedly comedy, like at least underground,\n\n2:24:13.660 --> 2:24:14.500\n it thrived.\n\n2:24:14.500 --> 2:24:16.860\n Yeah, there's a, well, no, it permeates the entire culture.\n\n2:24:16.860 --> 2:24:18.300\n There's a dark humor.\n\n2:24:18.300 --> 2:24:19.140\n Yeah.\n\n2:24:19.140 --> 2:24:21.420\n That sort of the cruelty, the absurdity of life\n\n2:24:21.420 --> 2:24:24.860\n really brings out the humor amongst the populace\n\n2:24:24.860 --> 2:24:26.780\n plus vodka on top of that.\n\n2:24:26.780 --> 2:24:30.060\n But this idea that, for example, Elon Musk has that\n\n2:24:31.860 --> 2:24:34.940\n the most entertaining outcome is the most likely.\n\n2:24:36.220 --> 2:24:39.980\n That it seems like the most absurd, silly, funny thing\n\n2:24:39.980 --> 2:24:41.340\n seems to be the thing that.\n\n2:24:41.340 --> 2:24:44.700\n So it happens more often than it should.\n\n2:24:44.700 --> 2:24:49.140\n And it somehow becomes viral in our modern connected world.\n\n2:24:49.140 --> 2:24:53.340\n And so the fun stuff, the memes spread,\n\n2:24:53.340 --> 2:24:56.780\n and then we start to optimize for the fun meme\n\n2:24:56.780 --> 2:24:58.820\n that seems to be a fundamental property\n\n2:24:58.820 --> 2:25:00.300\n of the reality we live in.\n\n2:25:01.700 --> 2:25:06.460\n And so emerges the fun maximizer in all walks of life,\n\n2:25:06.460 --> 2:25:11.460\n like in chess, in poker, in everything.\n\n2:25:13.340 --> 2:25:14.180\n I think.\n\n2:25:14.180 --> 2:25:15.020\n You're not skeptical.\n\n2:25:15.020 --> 2:25:15.900\n No, I'm not skeptical.\n\n2:25:15.900 --> 2:25:20.260\n I'm just, I'm just taking it all in.\n\n2:25:20.260 --> 2:25:24.020\n But I find it interesting and not at all impossible.\n\n2:25:25.020 --> 2:25:26.700\n Do you ever get lonely?\n\n2:25:26.700 --> 2:25:27.780\n Oh yeah, for sure.\n\n2:25:28.660 --> 2:25:32.540\n Like a chess player's life is by definition pretty lonely\n\n2:25:34.140 --> 2:25:36.620\n because you have nobody else to blame but yourself\n\n2:25:36.620 --> 2:25:39.700\n when you lose or you don't achieve the results\n\n2:25:39.700 --> 2:25:41.180\n that you want to achieve.\n\n2:25:41.180 --> 2:25:44.460\n It's difficult for you to find comfort elsewhere.\n\n2:25:44.460 --> 2:25:46.220\n It's in your own mind.\n\n2:25:46.220 --> 2:25:47.060\n Yeah.\n\n2:25:47.060 --> 2:25:48.460\n It's you versus yourself, really.\n\n2:25:48.460 --> 2:25:49.300\n Yeah, really.\n\n2:25:50.740 --> 2:25:55.140\n But it's, you know, it's part of the profession.\n\n2:25:55.140 --> 2:25:58.460\n But I think any like sport or activity\n\n2:25:58.460 --> 2:26:02.460\n where it's just you and your own mind\n\n2:26:02.460 --> 2:26:04.660\n is just by definition lonely.\n\n2:26:04.660 --> 2:26:06.900\n Are you worried that it destroys you?\n\n2:26:06.900 --> 2:26:08.020\n Oh, not at all.\n\n2:26:08.020 --> 2:26:10.540\n As long as I'm aware of it, then it's fine.\n\n2:26:10.540 --> 2:26:15.540\n And I don't think the inherent loneliness\n\n2:26:15.900 --> 2:26:20.420\n of my profession really affects the rest of my life\n\n2:26:20.420 --> 2:26:21.620\n in a major way.\n\n2:26:23.340 --> 2:26:26.660\n What role does love play in the human condition\n\n2:26:26.660 --> 2:26:30.660\n and in your lonely life of calculation?\n\n2:26:30.660 --> 2:26:40.660\n Well, you know, I'm like everybody else trying, you know...\n\n2:26:40.660 --> 2:26:41.500\n Trying to find love?\n\n2:26:41.500 --> 2:26:43.860\n No, not necessarily like trying to find love.\n\n2:26:43.860 --> 2:26:46.660\n Sometimes I am, sometimes I'm not.\n\n2:26:46.660 --> 2:26:48.460\n I'm just trying to find my way.\n\n2:26:48.460 --> 2:26:49.300\n Yeah.\n\n2:26:49.300 --> 2:26:54.300\n And my love for the game,\n\n2:26:54.540 --> 2:26:55.980\n obviously it comes and goes a little bit,\n\n2:26:55.980 --> 2:26:59.340\n but there's like, there's always at least some level of love.\n\n2:26:59.340 --> 2:27:01.980\n So that doesn't go away.\n\n2:27:01.980 --> 2:27:05.660\n But I think in other parts of life,\n\n2:27:05.660 --> 2:27:10.660\n I think it's just about doing things that make you happy,\n\n2:27:11.220 --> 2:27:12.060\n that give you joy,\n\n2:27:12.060 --> 2:27:16.300\n that also makes you more receptive to love in general.\n\n2:27:16.300 --> 2:27:20.700\n So that has been my approach to love now\n\n2:27:20.700 --> 2:27:25.260\n for quite a while that I'm just trying to live my best life\n\n2:27:25.260 --> 2:27:30.260\n and then the love will come when it comes\n\n2:27:30.540 --> 2:27:33.500\n and in terms of romantic love,\n\n2:27:33.500 --> 2:27:35.820\n it has come and gone in my life.\n\n2:27:35.820 --> 2:27:40.820\n It's not there now, but I'm not worried about that.\n\n2:27:42.740 --> 2:27:45.540\n I'm more worried about, you know, not worried,\n\n2:27:45.540 --> 2:27:50.540\n but more like trying to just be a good version of myself.\n\n2:27:50.900 --> 2:27:53.060\n I cannot always be the best version of myself,\n\n2:27:53.060 --> 2:27:55.060\n but at least try to be good.\n\n2:27:55.060 --> 2:27:56.460\n Yeah, and keep your heart open.\n\n2:27:56.460 --> 2:27:59.380\n What is this Daniel Johnson song?\n\n2:27:59.380 --> 2:28:01.660\n True love will find you in the end.\n\n2:28:01.660 --> 2:28:03.100\n No, it may or may not.\n\n2:28:03.100 --> 2:28:06.180\n But it will only find you if,\n\n2:28:07.300 --> 2:28:08.340\n oh fuck, how does it go?\n\n2:28:08.340 --> 2:28:10.820\n If you're looking, so like you have to be open to it.\n\n2:28:10.820 --> 2:28:11.660\n Yeah.\n\n2:28:11.660 --> 2:28:12.820\n It may or may not.\n\n2:28:12.820 --> 2:28:13.660\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:28:13.660 --> 2:28:15.700\n And no matter what, you're gonna lose it in the end\n\n2:28:15.700 --> 2:28:17.980\n because it all ends, the whole thing ends.\n\n2:28:17.980 --> 2:28:19.420\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:28:19.420 --> 2:28:22.340\n I don't think stressing over that,\n\n2:28:22.340 --> 2:28:26.380\n like obviously it's so human\n\n2:28:26.380 --> 2:28:28.620\n that you can't help it to some degree,\n\n2:28:28.620 --> 2:28:30.940\n but I feel like stressing over love,\n\n2:28:30.940 --> 2:28:34.940\n that's the blueprint for whether you're looking\n\n2:28:34.940 --> 2:28:39.540\n or you're not looking or you're in a relationship\n\n2:28:39.540 --> 2:28:41.540\n or married or anything,\n\n2:28:41.540 --> 2:28:44.500\n like stressing over it is like the blueprint\n\n2:28:44.500 --> 2:28:46.300\n for being unhappy.\n\n2:28:46.300 --> 2:28:49.260\n Just to clarify confusion I have,\n\n2:28:49.260 --> 2:28:50.260\n just a quick question.\n\n2:28:50.260 --> 2:28:52.460\n How does the knight move?\n\n2:28:52.460 --> 2:28:55.780\n Ha, so the knight moves in an L\n\n2:28:57.020 --> 2:29:01.300\n and unlike in shogi it can move both forwards and backwards.\n\n2:29:02.300 --> 2:29:05.780\n It is quite a nimble piece.\n\n2:29:05.780 --> 2:29:08.140\n It can jump over everything,\n\n2:29:08.140 --> 2:29:10.140\n but it's less happy in open position\n\n2:29:10.140 --> 2:29:14.820\n where it has to move from side to side quickly.\n\n2:29:14.820 --> 2:29:18.180\n I am generally more of a bishops guy myself\n\n2:29:18.180 --> 2:29:19.540\n for the old debate.\n\n2:29:19.540 --> 2:29:24.420\n I just prefer quality over the intangibles,\n\n2:29:24.420 --> 2:29:28.420\n but I can appreciate a good knight once in a while.\n\n2:29:28.420 --> 2:29:30.660\n Last simple question.\n\n2:29:30.660 --> 2:29:33.660\n What's the meaning of life, Magnus Carlsen?\n\n2:29:33.660 --> 2:29:36.180\n There's obviously no meaning to life.\n\n2:29:36.180 --> 2:29:37.500\n Is that obvious?\n\n2:29:37.500 --> 2:29:39.420\n I think we're here by accident.\n\n2:29:39.420 --> 2:29:42.220\n There's no meaning, it ends at some point,\n\n2:29:42.220 --> 2:29:43.580\n but it's still a great thing.\n\n2:29:43.580 --> 2:29:44.420\n So.\n\n2:29:44.420 --> 2:29:47.180\n Yeah, you can still have fun even if there's no meaning.\n\n2:29:47.180 --> 2:29:48.260\n Yeah, you can still have fun.\n\n2:29:48.260 --> 2:29:52.740\n You can try and pursue your goals, whatever they may be,\n\n2:29:52.740 --> 2:29:55.660\n but I'm pretty sure there's no special meaning\n\n2:29:55.660 --> 2:29:59.620\n and trying to find it also doesn't make\n\n2:29:59.620 --> 2:30:01.340\n a whole lot of sense to me.\n\n2:30:01.340 --> 2:30:05.700\n For me, life is both meaningless and meaningful\n\n2:30:05.700 --> 2:30:09.020\n for just being here, trying to make,\n\n2:30:09.020 --> 2:30:10.460\n not necessarily the most of it,\n\n2:30:10.460 --> 2:30:13.140\n but the things that make you happy\n\n2:30:13.140 --> 2:30:15.660\n both short term and also long term.\n\n2:30:15.660 --> 2:30:18.540\n Yeah, it seems to be full of cool stuff to enjoy.\n\n2:30:18.540 --> 2:30:20.300\n It certainly does.\n\n2:30:20.300 --> 2:30:23.460\n And one of those is having a conversation with you.\n\n2:30:23.460 --> 2:30:25.700\n Magnus, it's a huge honor to talk to you.\n\n2:30:25.700 --> 2:30:28.100\n Thank you so much for spending this time with me.\n\n2:30:28.100 --> 2:30:29.900\n I can't wait to see what you do in this world\n\n2:30:29.900 --> 2:30:32.780\n and thank you for creating so much elegance and beauty\n\n2:30:32.780 --> 2:30:34.180\n on the chessboard and beyond.\n\n2:30:34.180 --> 2:30:36.100\n So thanks for talking today, brother.\n\n2:30:36.100 --> 2:30:36.940\n Thank you so much.\n\n2:30:36.940 --> 2:30:38.540\n Thanks for having me.\n\n2:30:38.540 --> 2:30:42.660\n And I wanted to say this at the start,\n\n2:30:42.660 --> 2:30:44.180\n but I never really got the chance.\n\n2:30:44.180 --> 2:30:49.180\n I was always a bit apprehensive about doing this podcast\n\n2:30:49.300 --> 2:30:50.900\n because you are a very smart guy\n\n2:30:50.900 --> 2:30:54.380\n and your audience is very smart\n\n2:30:54.380 --> 2:30:58.980\n and I always had a bit of imposter syndrome.\n\n2:30:58.980 --> 2:31:03.500\n So I'll tell you this now after the podcast.\n\n2:31:03.500 --> 2:31:07.660\n So please do judge me, but I hope you've enjoyed it.\n\n2:31:07.660 --> 2:31:08.500\n I loved it.\n\n2:31:08.500 --> 2:31:09.780\n You're a brilliant man.\n\n2:31:09.780 --> 2:31:12.700\n And I love the fact that you have imposter syndrome\n\n2:31:12.700 --> 2:31:14.500\n because a lot of us do.\n\n2:31:14.500 --> 2:31:17.540\n And so that's beautiful to see even at the very top,\n\n2:31:17.540 --> 2:31:19.340\n but you still feel like an imposter.\n\n2:31:20.460 --> 2:31:21.300\n Thank you, brother.\n\n2:31:21.300 --> 2:31:22.900\n Thanks for talking today.\n\n2:31:22.900 --> 2:31:24.420\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:31:24.420 --> 2:31:25.660\n with Magnus Carlsen.\n\n2:31:25.660 --> 2:31:26.940\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:31:26.940 --> 2:31:29.740\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:31:29.740 --> 2:31:33.420\n And now let me leave you with some words from Bobby Fischer.\n\n2:31:33.420 --> 2:31:36.900\n Chess is a war over the board.\n\n2:31:36.900 --> 2:31:39.500\n The object is to crush the opponent's mind.\n\n2:31:39.500 --> 2:31:43.460\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
