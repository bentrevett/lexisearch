devices\n\n00:06.480 --> 00:09.360\n that can monitor and record brain activity.\n\n00:09.360 --> 00:12.080\n And previously, he was the founder of Braintree,\n\n00:12.080 --> 00:14.760\n a mobile payment company that acquired Venmo\n\n00:14.760 --> 00:17.840\n and then was acquired by PayPal and eBay.\n\n00:17.840 --> 00:19.720\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:19.720 --> 00:24.280\n Forsigmatic, NetSuite, Grammarly, and ExpressVPN.\n\n00:24.280 --> 00:27.760\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:27.760 --> 00:30.160\n As a side note, let me say that this was a fun\n\n00:30.160 --> 00:31.720\n and memorable experience,\n\n00:31.720 --> 00:34.040\n wearing the Kernel FlowBrain interface\n\n00:34.040 --> 00:35.920\n in the beginning of this conversation,\n\n00:35.920 --> 00:38.080\n as you can see if you watch the video version\n\n00:38.080 --> 00:39.520\n of this episode.\n\n00:39.520 --> 00:42.900\n And there was a Ubuntu Linux machine sitting next to me\n\n00:42.900 --> 00:44.840\n collecting the data from my brain.\n\n00:44.840 --> 00:47.840\n The whole thing gave me hope that the mystery\n\n00:47.840 --> 00:51.480\n of the human mind will be unlocked in the coming decades\n\n00:51.480 --> 00:53.760\n as we begin to measure signals from the brain\n\n00:53.760 --> 00:55.400\n in a high bandwidth way.\n\n00:55.400 --> 00:56.600\n To understand the mind,\n\n00:56.600 --> 01:00.160\n we either have to build it or to measure it.\n\n01:00.160 --> 01:02.200\n Both are worth a try.\n\n01:02.200 --> 01:04.200\n Thanks to Brian and the rest of the Kernel team\n\n01:04.200 --> 01:06.320\n for making this little demo happen.\n\n01:06.320 --> 01:08.640\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,\n\n01:08.640 --> 01:12.300\n and here is my conversation with Brian Johnson.\n\n01:13.240 --> 01:14.080\n You ready, Lex?\n\n01:14.080 --> 01:15.680\n Yes, I'm ready.\n\n01:15.680 --> 01:18.000\n Do you guys wanna come in and put the interfaces\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:18.840\n on our heads?\n\n01:18.840 --> 01:22.040\n And then I will proceed to tell you a few jokes.\n\n01:22.040 --> 01:25.760\n So we have two incredible pieces of technology\n\n01:25.760 --> 01:30.480\n and a machine running Ubuntu 2004 in front of us.\n\n01:30.480 --> 01:31.520\n What are we doing?\n\n01:31.520 --> 01:32.360\n All right.\n\n01:32.360 --> 01:33.200\n Are these going on our heads?\n\n01:33.200 --> 01:34.040\n They're going on our heads, yeah.\n\n01:34.040 --> 01:39.040\n And they will place it on our heads for proper alignment.\n\n01:41.800 --> 01:43.200\n Does this support giant heads?\n\n01:43.200 --> 01:45.120\n Because I kind of have a giant head.\n\n01:45.120 --> 01:46.440\n Is this just giant head?\n\n01:46.440 --> 01:48.040\n Are you saying as like an ego\n\n01:48.040 --> 01:55.760\n or are you saying physically both?\n\n01:55.760 --> 01:57.040\n It's a nice massage.\n\n01:57.040 --> 01:57.880\n Yes.\n\n01:59.960 --> 02:01.920\n Okay, how does this feel?\n\n02:01.920 --> 02:04.720\n It's okay to move around?\n\n02:04.720 --> 02:05.680\n Yeah.\n\n02:05.680 --> 02:07.440\n It feels, oh yeah.\n\n02:07.440 --> 02:08.280\n Hey, hey.\n\n02:10.920 --> 02:11.760\n This feels awesome.\n\n02:11.760 --> 02:12.840\n It's a pretty good fit.\n\n02:12.840 --> 02:13.680\n Thank you.\n\n02:13.680 --> 02:15.640\n That feels good.\n\n02:15.640 --> 02:17.640\n So this is big head friendly.\n\n02:17.640 --> 02:19.080\n It suits you well, Lex.\n\n02:19.080 --> 02:19.920\n Thank you.\n\n02:22.040 --> 02:23.560\n I feel like I need to,\n\n02:24.600 --> 02:25.760\n I feel like when I wear this,\n\n02:25.760 --> 02:27.040\n I need to sound like Sam Harris,\n\n02:27.040 --> 02:31.760\n calm, collected, eloquent.\n\n02:31.760 --> 02:34.080\n I feel smarter, actually.\n\n02:34.080 --> 02:36.840\n I don't think I've ever felt quite as much\n\n02:36.840 --> 02:38.720\n like I'm part of the future as now.\n\n02:38.720 --> 02:40.680\n Have you ever worn a brain interface\n\n02:40.680 --> 02:42.520\n or had your brain imaged?\n\n02:42.520 --> 02:44.680\n Oh, never had my brain imaged.\n\n02:45.560 --> 02:47.280\n The only way I've analyzed my brain\n\n02:47.280 --> 02:52.280\n is by talking to myself and thinking.\n\n02:52.280 --> 02:53.720\n No direct data.\n\n02:53.720 --> 02:56.360\n Yeah, that is definitely a brain interface\n\n02:57.400 --> 02:59.240\n that has a lot of blind spots.\n\n02:59.240 --> 03:01.320\n It has some blind spots, yeah.\n\n03:01.320 --> 03:02.480\n Psychotherapy.\n\n03:02.480 --> 03:03.320\n That's right.\n\n03:04.440 --> 03:07.040\n All right, are we recording?\n\n03:07.040 --> 03:08.280\n Yeah, we're good.\n\n03:08.280 --> 03:09.600\n All right.\n\n03:09.600 --> 03:12.680\n So Lex, the objective of this,\n\n03:12.680 --> 03:16.960\n I'm going to tell you some jokes\n\n03:16.960 --> 03:18.920\n and your objective is to not smile,\n\n03:18.920 --> 03:22.960\n which as a Russian, you should have an edge.\n\n03:22.960 --> 03:24.520\n Make the motherland proud.\n\n03:24.520 --> 03:25.520\n I gotcha.\n\n03:25.520 --> 03:26.360\n Okay.\n\n03:28.200 --> 03:29.440\n Let's hear the jokes.\n\n03:29.440 --> 03:32.280\n Lex, and this is from the Colonel Crew.\n\n03:33.960 --> 03:37.080\n We've been working on a device that can read your mind\n\n03:37.080 --> 03:39.080\n and we would love to see your thoughts.\n\n03:42.200 --> 03:43.960\n Is that the joke?\n\n03:43.960 --> 03:44.840\n That's the opening.\n\n03:44.840 --> 03:49.840\n Okay.\n\n03:49.960 --> 03:53.640\n If I'm seeing the muscle activation correctly on your lips,\n\n03:53.640 --> 03:54.760\n you're not going to do well on this.\n\n03:54.760 --> 03:55.600\n Let's see.\n\n03:55.600 --> 03:56.480\n All right, here comes the first.\n\n03:56.480 --> 03:57.320\n I'm screwed.\n\n03:57.320 --> 03:58.240\n Here comes the first one.\n\n03:58.240 --> 03:59.920\n Is this going to break the device?\n\n04:01.200 --> 04:04.280\n Is it resilient to laughter?\n\n04:07.120 --> 04:09.480\n Lex, what goes through a potato's brain?\n\n04:09.480 --> 04:14.320\n I can't.\n\n04:14.320 --> 04:15.760\n I got already failed.\n\n04:15.760 --> 04:17.280\n That's the hilarious opener.\n\n04:17.280 --> 04:18.120\n Okay.\n\n04:18.120 --> 04:19.280\n What?\n\n04:19.280 --> 04:20.200\n Tater thoughts.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.720\n What kind of fish performs brain surgery?\n\n04:27.720 --> 04:29.000\n I don't know.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:30.160\n A neural surgeon.\n\n04:35.520 --> 04:37.680\n And so we're getting data of everything\n\n04:37.680 --> 04:39.040\n that's happening in my brain right now?\n\n04:39.040 --> 04:39.880\n Lifetime, yeah.\n\n04:39.880 --> 04:44.880\n We're getting activation patterns of your entire cortex.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:46.240\n I'm going to try to do better.\n\n04:46.240 --> 04:48.240\n I'll edit out all the parts where I laughed.\n\n04:48.240 --> 04:50.600\n Photoshop put a serious face over me.\n\n04:50.600 --> 04:51.960\n You can recover.\n\n04:51.960 --> 04:52.880\n Yeah, all right.\n\n04:53.760 --> 04:57.000\n Lex, what do scholars eat when they're hungry?\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.440\n I don't know, what?\n\n04:58.440 --> 04:59.840\n Academia nuts.\n\n05:03.600 --> 05:05.880\n That was a pretty good one.\n\n05:05.880 --> 05:07.240\n So what we'll do is,\n\n05:07.240 --> 05:11.360\n so you're wearing kernel flow,\n\n05:11.360 --> 05:16.360\n which is an interface built using technology\n\n05:16.600 --> 05:17.680\n called spectroscopy.\n\n05:17.680 --> 05:20.640\n So it's similar to what we wear wearables on the wrist\n\n05:20.640 --> 05:22.240\n using light.\n\n05:22.240 --> 05:24.640\n So using LIDAR, as you know,\n\n05:24.640 --> 05:28.960\n and we're using that to image the functional imaging\n\n05:28.960 --> 05:30.320\n of brain activity.\n\n05:30.320 --> 05:35.120\n And so as your neurons fire electrically and chemically,\n\n05:35.120 --> 05:37.400\n it creates blood oxygenation levels.\n\n05:37.400 --> 05:38.240\n We're measuring that.\n\n05:38.240 --> 05:41.120\n And so you'll see in the reconstructions we do for you,\n\n05:41.120 --> 05:43.040\n you'll see your activation patterns in your brain\n\n05:43.040 --> 05:45.800\n as throughout this entire time we are wearing it.\n\n05:45.800 --> 05:47.720\n So in the reaction to the jokes\n\n05:47.720 --> 05:50.240\n and as we were sitting here talking,\n\n05:50.240 --> 05:54.560\n and so we're moving towards a real time feed\n\n05:54.560 --> 05:56.880\n of your cortical brain activity.\n\n05:56.880 --> 05:59.440\n So there's a bunch of things that are in contact\n\n05:59.440 --> 06:02.240\n with my skull right now.\n\n06:02.240 --> 06:03.640\n How many of them are there?\n\n06:03.640 --> 06:05.880\n And so how many of them are, what are they?\n\n06:05.880 --> 06:07.120\n What are the actual sensors?\n\n06:07.120 --> 06:09.000\n There's 52 modules,\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:13.720\n and each module has one laser and six sensors.\n\n06:13.720 --> 06:18.480\n And the sensors fire in about 100 picoseconds.\n\n06:18.480 --> 06:21.480\n And then the photons scatter and absorb in your brain.\n\n06:21.480 --> 06:24.400\n And then a few go in, a few come back out,\n\n06:24.400 --> 06:25.880\n a bunch go in, then a few come back out,\n\n06:25.880 --> 06:27.920\n and we sense those photons\n\n06:27.920 --> 06:30.360\n and then we do the reconstruction for the activity.\n\n06:30.360 --> 06:33.520\n Overall, there's about a thousand plus channels\n\n06:33.520 --> 06:35.640\n that are sampling your activity.\n\n06:35.640 --> 06:38.760\n How difficult is it to make it as comfortable as it is?\n\n06:38.760 --> 06:40.720\n Because it's surprisingly comfortable.\n\n06:40.720 --> 06:42.800\n I would not think it would be comfortable.\n\n06:44.280 --> 06:48.320\n Something that's measuring brain activity,\n\n06:48.320 --> 06:51.160\n I would not think it would be comfortable, but it is.\n\n06:51.160 --> 06:52.000\n I agree.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:52.880\n In fact, I want to take this home.\n\n06:52.880 --> 06:54.200\n Yeah, yeah, that's right.\n\n06:54.200 --> 06:58.360\n So people are accustomed to being in big systems\n\n06:58.360 --> 07:02.200\n like fMRI where there's 120 decibel sounds\n\n07:02.200 --> 07:05.560\n and you're in a claustrophobic encasement,\n\n07:05.560 --> 07:09.240\n or EEG, which is just painful, or surgery.\n\n07:09.240 --> 07:12.240\n And so, yes, I agree that this is a convenient option\n\n07:12.240 --> 07:14.360\n to be able to just put on your head\n\n07:14.360 --> 07:15.960\n that measures your brain activity\n\n07:15.960 --> 07:17.960\n in the contextual environment you choose.\n\n07:17.960 --> 07:20.200\n So if we want to have it during a podcast,\n\n07:20.200 --> 07:22.640\n if we want to be at home in a business setting,\n\n07:24.400 --> 07:27.480\n it's freedom to record your brain activity\n\n07:27.480 --> 07:29.000\n in the setting that you choose.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\n Yeah, but sort of from an engineering perspective,\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:32.920\n are these, what is it?\n\n07:32.920 --> 07:34.960\n There's a bunch of different modular parts\n\n07:34.960 --> 07:38.080\n and they're kind of, there's like a rubber band thing\n\n07:38.080 --> 07:40.880\n where they mold to the shape of your head.\n\n07:40.880 --> 07:41.720\n That's right.\n\n07:41.720 --> 07:45.480\n So we built this version of the mechanical design\n\n07:45.480 --> 07:48.760\n to accommodate most adult heads.\n\n07:49.760 --> 07:51.760\n But I have a giant head and it fits fine.\n\n07:51.760 --> 07:53.800\n It fits well, actually.\n\n07:53.800 --> 07:55.840\n So I don't think I have an average head.\n\n07:55.840 --> 08:00.840\n Okay, maybe I feel much better about my head now.\n\n08:01.640 --> 08:05.240\n Maybe I'm more average than I thought.\n\n08:06.160 --> 08:08.720\n Okay, so what else is there interesting\n\n08:08.720 --> 08:10.840\n that you could say while it's on our heads?\n\n08:10.840 --> 08:12.120\n I can keep this on the whole time.\n\n08:12.120 --> 08:13.480\n This is kind of awesome.\n\n08:13.480 --> 08:16.080\n And it's amazing for me, as a fan of Ubuntu,\n\n08:16.080 --> 08:18.880\n I use Ubuntu MATE, you guys use that too.\n\n08:18.880 --> 08:23.360\n But it's amazing to have code running to the side,\n\n08:23.360 --> 08:26.200\n measuring stuff and collecting data.\n\n08:26.200 --> 08:30.360\n I mean, I feel like much more important now\n\n08:30.360 --> 08:32.560\n that my data is being recorded.\n\n08:32.560 --> 08:35.240\n Like, you know when you have a good friend\n\n08:35.240 --> 08:40.240\n that listens to you, that actually is listening to you?\n\n08:40.240 --> 08:43.080\n This is what I feel like, like a much better friend\n\n08:43.080 --> 08:47.120\n because it's like accurately listening to me, Ubuntu.\n\n08:47.120 --> 08:50.600\n What a cool perspective, I hadn't thought about that,\n\n08:50.600 --> 08:53.960\n of feeling understood.\n\n08:53.960 --> 08:54.800\n Heard.\n\n08:54.800 --> 08:59.240\n Yeah, heard deeply by the mechanical system\n\n08:59.240 --> 09:01.960\n that is recording your brain activity,\n\n09:01.960 --> 09:04.480\n versus the human that you're engaging with,\n\n09:04.480 --> 09:06.280\n that your mind immediately goes to\n\n09:07.720 --> 09:09.520\n that there's this dimensionality\n\n09:09.520 --> 09:12.600\n and depth of understanding of this software system\n\n09:12.600 --> 09:14.600\n which you're intimately familiar with.\n\n09:14.600 --> 09:17.360\n And now you're able to communicate with this system\n\n09:17.360 --> 09:19.280\n in ways that you couldn't before.\n\n09:19.280 --> 09:20.760\n Yeah, I feel heard.\n\n09:24.600 --> 09:26.880\n Yeah, I mean, I guess what's interesting about this is\n\n09:26.880 --> 09:28.760\n your intuitions are spot on.\n\n09:28.760 --> 09:30.920\n Most people have intuitions about brain interfaces\n\n09:30.920 --> 09:32.960\n that they've grown up with this idea\n\n09:32.960 --> 09:34.800\n of people moving cursors on the screen\n\n09:34.800 --> 09:38.600\n or typing or changing the channel or skipping a song.\n\n09:38.600 --> 09:41.840\n It's primarily been anchored on control.\n\n09:41.840 --> 09:44.920\n And I think the more relevant understanding\n\n09:44.920 --> 09:47.280\n of brain interfaces or neuroimaging\n\n09:47.280 --> 09:49.760\n is that it's a measurement system.\n\n09:49.760 --> 09:53.280\n And once you have numbers for a given thing,\n\n09:53.280 --> 09:54.920\n a seemingly endless number of possibilities\n\n09:54.920 --> 09:57.760\n emerge around that of what to do with those numbers.\n\n09:57.760 --> 09:59.880\n So before you tell me about the possibilities,\n\n09:59.880 --> 10:01.520\n this was an incredible experience.\n\n10:01.520 --> 10:03.880\n I can keep this on for another two hours,\n\n10:03.880 --> 10:08.880\n but I'm being told that for a bunch of reasons,\n\n10:08.960 --> 10:11.240\n just because we probably wanna keep the data small\n\n10:11.240 --> 10:13.840\n and visualize it nicely for the final product,\n\n10:13.840 --> 10:17.440\n we wanna cut this off and take this amazing helmet\n\n10:17.440 --> 10:18.280\n away from me.\n\n10:18.280 --> 10:21.240\n So Brian, thank you so much for this experience\n\n10:21.240 --> 10:25.160\n and let's continue without helmetless.\n\n10:25.160 --> 10:26.200\n All right.\n\n10:26.200 --> 10:28.920\n So that was an incredible experience.\n\n10:28.920 --> 10:31.240\n Can you maybe speak to what kind of opportunities\n\n10:31.240 --> 10:32.960\n that opens up that stream of data,\n\n10:32.960 --> 10:35.520\n that rich stream of data from the brain?\n\n10:35.520 --> 10:38.360\n First, I'm curious, what is your reaction?\n\n10:38.360 --> 10:41.560\n What comes to mind when you put that on your head?\n\n10:41.560 --> 10:42.840\n What does it mean to you?\n\n10:42.840 --> 10:44.120\n And what possibilities emerge\n\n10:44.120 --> 10:46.760\n and what significance might it have?\n\n10:46.760 --> 10:49.500\n I'm curious where your orientation is at.\n\n10:50.880 --> 10:54.840\n Well, for me, I'm really excited by the possibility\n\n10:54.840 --> 10:59.440\n of various information about my body,\n\n10:59.440 --> 11:03.320\n about my mind being converted into data,\n\n11:03.320 --> 11:06.320\n such that data can be used to create products\n\n11:06.320 --> 11:07.360\n that make my life better.\n\n11:07.360 --> 11:09.760\n So that to me is really exciting possibility.\n\n11:09.760 --> 11:13.080\n Even just like a Fitbit that measures, I don't know,\n\n11:13.080 --> 11:15.720\n some very basic measurements about your body\n\n11:15.720 --> 11:17.120\n is really cool.\n\n11:17.120 --> 11:20.560\n But the bandwidth of information,\n\n11:20.560 --> 11:22.720\n the resolution of that information is very crude,\n\n11:22.720 --> 11:23.960\n so it's not very interesting.\n\n11:23.960 --> 11:28.000\n The possibility of just building a data set\n\n11:29.480 --> 11:32.440\n coming in a clean way and a high bandwidth way\n\n11:32.440 --> 11:37.440\n from my brain opens up all kinds of...\n\n11:37.440 --> 11:40.840\n I was kind of joking when we were talking,\n\n11:40.840 --> 11:44.680\n but it's not really, it's like I feel heard\n\n11:44.680 --> 11:49.280\n in the sense that it feels like the full richness\n\n11:49.280 --> 11:51.680\n of the information coming from my mind\n\n11:51.680 --> 11:56.080\n is actually being recorded by the machine.\n\n11:56.080 --> 12:00.160\n I mean, I can't quite put it into words,\n\n12:00.160 --> 12:02.880\n but there is genuinely for me,\n\n12:02.880 --> 12:05.160\n there's not some kind of joke about me being a robot.\n\n12:05.160 --> 12:09.080\n It just genuinely feels like I'm being heard\n\n12:09.080 --> 12:13.880\n in a way that's going to improve my life,\n\n12:13.880 --> 12:16.320\n as long as the thing that's on the other end\n\n12:16.320 --> 12:17.760\n can do something useful with that data.\n\n12:17.760 --> 12:20.400\n But even the recording itself is like,\n\n12:20.400 --> 12:24.200\n once you record, it's like taking a picture.\n\n12:25.320 --> 12:28.480\n That moment is forever saved in time.\n\n12:28.480 --> 12:32.680\n Now, a picture cannot allow you to step back\n\n12:32.680 --> 12:37.680\n into that world, but perhaps recording your brain\n\n12:38.240 --> 12:41.160\n is a much higher resolution thing,\n\n12:41.160 --> 12:44.720\n much more personal recording of that information\n\n12:44.720 --> 12:48.040\n than a picture that would allow you to step back\n\n12:48.040 --> 12:51.800\n into that where you were in that particular moment\n\n12:51.800 --> 12:54.160\n in history and then map out a certain trajectory\n\n12:54.160 --> 12:58.520\n to tell you certain things about yourself\n\n12:58.520 --> 13:00.360\n that could open up all kinds of applications.\n\n13:00.360 --> 13:02.640\n Of course, there's health that I consider,\n\n13:02.640 --> 13:06.600\n but honestly, to me, the exciting thing is just being heard.\n\n13:06.600 --> 13:08.960\n My state of mind, the level of focus,\n\n13:08.960 --> 13:10.920\n all those kinds of things, being heard.\n\n13:10.920 --> 13:13.800\n What I heard you say is you have an entirety\n\n13:13.800 --> 13:17.080\n of lived experience, some of which you can communicate\n\n13:17.080 --> 13:20.000\n in words and in body language,\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:21.440\n some of which you feel internally,\n\n13:21.440 --> 13:24.440\n which cannot be captured in those communication modalities,\n\n13:24.440 --> 13:27.640\n and that this measurement system captures\n\n13:27.640 --> 13:29.880\n both the things you can try to articulate in words,\n\n13:29.880 --> 13:31.480\n maybe in a lower dimensional space,\n\n13:31.480 --> 13:34.520\n using one word, for example, to communicate focus,\n\n13:34.520 --> 13:35.600\n when it really may be represented\n\n13:35.600 --> 13:39.720\n in a 20 dimensional space of this particular kind of focus\n\n13:39.720 --> 13:42.520\n and that this information is being captured,\n\n13:42.520 --> 13:44.360\n so it's a closer representation\n\n13:44.360 --> 13:47.480\n to the entirety of your experience captured\n\n13:47.480 --> 13:50.920\n in a dynamic fashion that is not just a static image\n\n13:50.920 --> 13:53.040\n of your conscious experience.\n\n13:53.040 --> 13:58.040\n Yeah, that's the promise, that was the feeling,\n\n13:58.280 --> 13:59.360\n and it felt like the future.\n\n13:59.360 --> 14:00.800\n So it was a pretty cool experience.\n\n14:00.800 --> 14:04.000\n And from the sort of mechanical perspective,\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:06.680\n it was cool to have an actual device\n\n14:06.680 --> 14:08.360\n that feels pretty good,\n\n14:08.360 --> 14:11.560\n that doesn't require me to go into the lab.\n\n14:11.560 --> 14:14.480\n And also the other thing I was feeling,\n\n14:14.480 --> 14:16.160\n there's a guy named Andrew Huberman,\n\n14:16.160 --> 14:17.920\n he's a friend of mine, amazing podcast,\n\n14:17.920 --> 14:21.600\n people should listen to it, Huberman Lab Podcast.\n\n14:21.600 --> 14:24.020\n We're working on a paper together\n\n14:24.020 --> 14:25.500\n about eye movement and so on.\n\n14:26.360 --> 14:28.440\n And we're kind of, he's a neuroscientist\n\n14:28.440 --> 14:30.280\n and I'm a data person, machine learning person,\n\n14:30.280 --> 14:35.280\n and we're both excited by how much the,\n\n14:38.720 --> 14:42.920\n how much the data measurements of the human mind,\n\n14:42.920 --> 14:44.840\n the brain and all the different metrics\n\n14:44.840 --> 14:47.720\n that come from that could be used to understand\n\n14:47.720 --> 14:50.520\n human beings and in a rigorous scientific way.\n\n14:50.520 --> 14:52.000\n So the other thing I was thinking about\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:55.960\n is how this could be turned into a tool for science.\n\n14:55.960 --> 14:57.680\n Sort of not just personal science,\n\n14:57.680 --> 15:00.520\n not just like Fitbit style,\n\n15:00.520 --> 15:04.040\n like how am I doing on my personal metrics of health,\n\n15:04.040 --> 15:07.760\n but doing larger scale studies of human behavior and so on.\n\n15:07.760 --> 15:10.480\n So like data, not at the scale of an individual,\n\n15:10.480 --> 15:12.480\n but data at a scale of many individuals\n\n15:12.480 --> 15:14.720\n or a large number of individuals.\n\n15:14.720 --> 15:17.000\n So personal being heard was exciting\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.940\n and also just for science is exciting.\n\n15:19.940 --> 15:23.200\n It's very easy, like there's a very powerful thing\n\n15:23.200 --> 15:25.600\n to it being so easy to just put on\n\n15:25.600 --> 15:28.320\n that you could scale much easier.\n\n15:28.320 --> 15:30.140\n If you think about that second thing you said\n\n15:30.140 --> 15:35.140\n about the science of the brain,\n\n15:37.520 --> 15:40.600\n most, we've done a pretty good job,\n\n15:40.600 --> 15:43.240\n like we, the human race has done a pretty good job\n\n15:43.240 --> 15:46.140\n figuring out how to quantify the things around us\n\n15:46.140 --> 15:51.140\n from distant stars to calories and steps and our genome.\n\n15:52.120 --> 15:55.360\n So we can measure and quantify pretty much everything\n\n15:55.360 --> 15:59.220\n in the known universe except for our minds.\n\n16:00.640 --> 16:02.160\n And we can do these one offs\n\n16:02.160 --> 16:03.640\n if we're going to get an fMRI scan\n\n16:03.640 --> 16:08.640\n or do something with a low res EEG system,\n\n16:08.880 --> 16:11.760\n but we haven't done this at population scale.\n\n16:11.760 --> 16:14.840\n And so if you think about human thought\n\n16:14.840 --> 16:19.320\n or human cognition is probably the single law,\n\n16:19.320 --> 16:23.360\n largest raw input material into society\n\n16:23.360 --> 16:25.720\n at any given moment is our conversations\n\n16:25.720 --> 16:27.920\n with ourselves and with other people.\n\n16:27.920 --> 16:32.920\n And we have this raw input that we can't,\n\n16:33.040 --> 16:35.180\n that haven't been able to measure yet.\n\n16:35.180 --> 16:38.760\n And if you, when I think about it through that frame,\n\n16:41.400 --> 16:43.320\n it's remarkable, it's almost like we live\n\n16:43.320 --> 16:48.320\n in this wild, wild West of unquantified communications\n\n16:49.480 --> 16:52.000\n within ourselves and between each other\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:53.440\n when everything else has been grounded in me.\n\n16:53.440 --> 16:56.560\n For example, I know if I buy an appliance at the store\n\n16:56.560 --> 17:00.640\n or on a website, I don't need to look at the measurements\n\n17:00.640 --> 17:03.040\n on the appliance and make sure it can fit through my door.\n\n17:03.040 --> 17:06.160\n That's an engineered system of appliance manufacturing\n\n17:06.160 --> 17:07.120\n and construction.\n\n17:07.120 --> 17:10.620\n Everyone's agreed upon engineering standards.\n\n17:10.620 --> 17:15.360\n And we don't have engineering standards around cognition.\n\n17:15.360 --> 17:16.880\n It's not a, it has not entered\n\n17:16.880 --> 17:20.040\n as a formal engineering discipline that enables us\n\n17:20.040 --> 17:23.040\n to scaffold in society with everything else we're doing,\n\n17:23.040 --> 17:26.560\n including consuming news, our relationships,\n\n17:26.560 --> 17:29.600\n politics, economics, education, all the above.\n\n17:29.600 --> 17:33.720\n And so to me that the most significant contribution\n\n17:33.720 --> 17:36.520\n that kernel technology has to offer\n\n17:36.520 --> 17:40.720\n would be the formal, the introduction\n\n17:40.720 --> 17:42.640\n to formal engineering of cognition\n\n17:42.640 --> 17:45.280\n as it relates to everything else in society.\n\n17:45.280 --> 17:50.100\n I love that idea that you kind of think that there's just\n\n17:50.100 --> 17:53.120\n this ocean of data that's coming from people's brains\n\n17:53.120 --> 17:57.360\n as being in a crude way, reduced down to like tweets\n\n17:57.360 --> 18:02.160\n and texts and so on, just a very hardcore,\n\n18:02.160 --> 18:06.060\n many scale compression of actual, the raw data.\n\n18:06.060 --> 18:08.320\n But maybe you can comment,\n\n18:08.320 --> 18:10.320\n because you're using the word cognition.\n\n18:11.760 --> 18:15.240\n I think the first step is to get the brain data.\n\n18:15.240 --> 18:19.200\n But is there a leap to be taking\n\n18:19.200 --> 18:22.140\n to sort of interpreting that data in terms of cognition?\n\n18:22.140 --> 18:25.440\n So is your idea is basically you need to start collecting\n\n18:25.440 --> 18:27.800\n data at scale from the brain,\n\n18:27.800 --> 18:32.680\n and then we start to really be able to take little steps\n\n18:32.680 --> 18:35.300\n along the path to actually measuring\n\n18:35.300 --> 18:37.760\n some deep sense of cognition.\n\n18:37.760 --> 18:42.760\n Because as I'm sure you know, we understand a few things,\n\n18:42.760 --> 18:47.280\n but we don't understand most of what makes up cognition.\n\n18:47.280 --> 18:50.380\n This has been one of the most significant challenges\n\n18:50.380 --> 18:52.440\n of building Kernel, and Kernel wouldn't exist\n\n18:52.440 --> 18:55.760\n if I wasn't able to fund it initially by myself.\n\n18:55.760 --> 18:59.280\n Because when I engage in conversations with investors,\n\n18:59.280 --> 19:02.800\n the immediate thought is, what is the killer app?\n\n19:02.800 --> 19:04.980\n And of course, I understand that heuristic,\n\n19:04.980 --> 19:05.820\n that's what they're looking at,\n\n19:05.820 --> 19:07.920\n is they're looking to de risk.\n\n19:07.920 --> 19:09.560\n Is the product solved?\n\n19:09.560 --> 19:10.740\n Is there a customer base?\n\n19:10.740 --> 19:11.920\n Are people willing to pay for it?\n\n19:11.920 --> 19:14.320\n How does it compare to competing options?\n\n19:14.320 --> 19:15.620\n And in the case with brain interfaces,\n\n19:15.620 --> 19:20.360\n when I started the company, there was no known path\n\n19:20.360 --> 19:21.520\n to even build a technology\n\n19:21.520 --> 19:24.400\n that could potentially become mainstream.\n\n19:24.400 --> 19:26.940\n And then once we figured out the technology,\n\n19:26.940 --> 19:28.840\n we could even, we could commence having conversations\n\n19:28.840 --> 19:31.320\n with investors and it became, what is the killer app?\n\n19:31.320 --> 19:33.240\n And so what has been,\n\n19:33.240 --> 19:36.400\n so I funded the first $53 million for the company.\n\n19:36.400 --> 19:39.820\n And to raise the round of funding, the first one we did,\n\n19:39.820 --> 19:42.560\n I spoke to 228 investors.\n\n19:42.560 --> 19:45.600\n One said yes, it was remarkable.\n\n19:45.600 --> 19:48.320\n And it was mostly around this concept\n\n19:48.320 --> 19:49.520\n around what is a killer app.\n\n19:49.520 --> 19:51.960\n And so internally, the way we think about it is,\n\n19:51.960 --> 19:55.320\n we think of the go to market strategy\n\n19:55.320 --> 19:57.860\n much more like the Drake equation,\n\n19:57.860 --> 20:00.680\n where if we can build technology\n\n20:00.680 --> 20:02.480\n that has the characteristics of,\n\n20:02.480 --> 20:05.120\n it has the data quality is high enough,\n\n20:05.120 --> 20:07.480\n it meets some certain threshold,\n\n20:07.480 --> 20:11.180\n cost, accessibility, comfort,\n\n20:11.180 --> 20:12.680\n it can be worn in contextual environments.\n\n20:12.680 --> 20:17.320\n If it meets the criteria of being a mass market device,\n\n20:17.320 --> 20:22.280\n then the responsibility that we have is to figure out\n\n20:22.280 --> 20:27.280\n how to create the algorithm that enables the human,\n\n20:29.320 --> 20:32.400\n to enable humans to then find value with it.\n\n20:32.400 --> 20:34.920\n So the analogy is like brain interfaces\n\n20:34.920 --> 20:37.080\n are like early 90s of the internet,\n\n20:37.080 --> 20:39.480\n is you wanna populate an ecosystem\n\n20:39.480 --> 20:40.560\n with a certain number of devices,\n\n20:40.560 --> 20:41.720\n you want a certain number of people\n\n20:41.720 --> 20:43.440\n who play around with them, who do experiments\n\n20:43.440 --> 20:44.480\n of certain data collection parameters,\n\n20:44.480 --> 20:46.440\n you want to encourage certain mistakes\n\n20:46.440 --> 20:48.020\n from experts and non experts.\n\n20:48.020 --> 20:51.920\n These are all critical elements that ignite discovery.\n\n20:51.920 --> 20:56.920\n And so we believe we've accomplished the first objective\n\n20:57.560 --> 21:01.800\n of building technology that reaches those thresholds.\n\n21:01.800 --> 21:03.500\n And now it's the Drake equation component\n\n21:03.500 --> 21:08.500\n of how do we try to generate 20 years of value discovery\n\n21:11.720 --> 21:12.880\n in a two or three year time period?\n\n21:12.880 --> 21:14.280\n How do we compress that?\n\n21:14.280 --> 21:17.520\n So just to clarify, so when you mean the Drake equation,\n\n21:17.520 --> 21:19.120\n which for people who don't know,\n\n21:19.120 --> 21:20.680\n I don't know why you, if you listen to this,\n\n21:20.680 --> 21:22.600\n I bring up aliens every single conversation.\n\n21:22.600 --> 21:24.000\n So I don't know how you would know\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:25.000\n what the Drake equation is,\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:28.600\n but you mean like the killer app,\n\n21:28.600 --> 21:31.240\n it would be one alien civilization in that equation.\n\n21:31.240 --> 21:34.800\n So meaning like this is in search of an application\n\n21:34.800 --> 21:36.520\n that's impactful, transformative.\n\n21:36.520 --> 21:38.080\n By the way, it should be, we need to come up\n\n21:38.080 --> 21:41.560\n with a better term than killer app as a.\n\n21:41.560 --> 21:43.060\n It's also violent, right?\n\n21:43.060 --> 21:43.900\n It's very violent.\n\n21:43.900 --> 21:46.680\n You can go like viral app, that's horrible too, right?\n\n21:46.680 --> 21:51.520\n It's some very inspiringly impactful application.\n\n21:51.520 --> 21:52.360\n How about that?\n\n21:52.360 --> 21:53.180\n No. Yeah.\n\n21:53.180 --> 21:55.320\n Okay, so ballistic with killer app, that's fine.\n\n21:55.320 --> 21:56.960\n Nobody's. But I concur with you.\n\n21:56.960 --> 22:01.960\n I dislike the chosen words in capturing the concept.\n\n22:02.200 --> 22:03.840\n You know, it's one of those sticky things\n\n22:03.840 --> 22:08.440\n that is as effective to use in the tech world.\n\n22:08.440 --> 22:11.520\n But when you now become a communicator\n\n22:11.520 --> 22:12.720\n outside of the tech world,\n\n22:12.720 --> 22:15.360\n especially when you're talking about software and hardware\n\n22:15.360 --> 22:17.360\n and artificial intelligence applications,\n\n22:17.360 --> 22:18.200\n it sounds horrible.\n\n22:18.200 --> 22:19.040\n Yeah, no, it's interesting.\n\n22:19.040 --> 22:21.360\n I actually regret now having called attention\n\n22:21.360 --> 22:24.200\n to cyber regret having used that word in this conversation\n\n22:24.200 --> 22:26.120\n because it's something I would not normally do.\n\n22:26.120 --> 22:29.120\n I used it in order to create a bridge\n\n22:29.120 --> 22:31.120\n of shared understanding of how others would,\n\n22:31.120 --> 22:32.800\n what terminology others would use.\n\n22:32.800 --> 22:33.640\n Yeah.\n\n22:33.640 --> 22:34.880\n But yeah, I concur.\n\n22:34.880 --> 22:38.200\n Let's go with impactful application.\n\n22:38.200 --> 22:39.040\n Or the.\n\n22:39.040 --> 22:40.040\n Just value creation.\n\n22:40.040 --> 22:41.360\n Value creation.\n\n22:41.360 --> 22:43.600\n Something people love using.\n\n22:43.600 --> 22:45.280\n There we go, that's it.\n\n22:45.280 --> 22:46.760\n Love app.\n\n22:46.760 --> 22:49.440\n Okay, so what, do you have any ideas?\n\n22:49.440 --> 22:51.040\n So you're basically creating a framework\n\n22:51.040 --> 22:54.220\n where there's the possibility of a discovery\n\n22:54.220 --> 22:57.360\n of an application that people love using.\n\n22:58.520 --> 22:59.640\n Is, do you have ideas?\n\n22:59.640 --> 23:01.560\n We've began to play a fun game internally\n\n23:01.560 --> 23:03.080\n where when we have these discussions\n\n23:03.080 --> 23:06.840\n or we begin circling around this concept of,\n\n23:08.340 --> 23:10.160\n does anybody have an idea?\n\n23:10.160 --> 23:11.400\n Does anyone have intuitions?\n\n23:11.400 --> 23:13.840\n And if we see the conversation starting\n\n23:13.840 --> 23:15.820\n to veer in that direction,\n\n23:15.820 --> 23:20.480\n we flag it and say, human intuition alert, stop it.\n\n23:20.480 --> 23:23.140\n And so we really want to focus on the algorithm\n\n23:23.140 --> 23:26.380\n of there's a natural process of human discovery.\n\n23:27.520 --> 23:30.480\n That when you populate a system with devices\n\n23:30.480 --> 23:33.080\n and you give people the opportunity to play around with it\n\n23:33.080 --> 23:35.440\n in expected and unexpected ways,\n\n23:35.440 --> 23:40.200\n we are thinking that is a much better system of discovery\n\n23:40.200 --> 23:41.480\n than us exercising intuitions.\n\n23:41.480 --> 23:42.600\n And it's interesting, we're also seeing\n\n23:42.600 --> 23:45.920\n a few neuroscientists who have been talking to us.\n\n23:45.920 --> 23:49.440\n While I was speaking to this one young associate professor,\n\n23:49.440 --> 23:50.960\n and I approached a conversation and said,\n\n23:50.960 --> 23:54.820\n hey, we have these five data streams that we're pulling off.\n\n23:56.160 --> 23:58.120\n When you hear that, what weighted value\n\n23:58.120 --> 23:59.520\n do you add to each data source?\n\n23:59.520 --> 24:00.880\n Which one do you think is going to be valuable\n\n24:00.880 --> 24:03.160\n for your objectives and which one's not?\n\n24:03.160 --> 24:05.720\n And he said, I don't care, just give me the data.\n\n24:05.720 --> 24:08.080\n All I care about is my machine learning model.\n\n24:08.080 --> 24:10.800\n But importantly, he did not have a theory of mind.\n\n24:10.800 --> 24:12.380\n He did not come to the table and say,\n\n24:12.380 --> 24:15.080\n I think the brain operates in this way\n\n24:15.080 --> 24:16.880\n and these reasons or have these functions.\n\n24:16.880 --> 24:19.040\n He didn't care, he just wanted the data.\n\n24:19.040 --> 24:20.800\n And we're seeing that more and more\n\n24:20.800 --> 24:25.800\n that certain people are devaluing human intuitions\n\n24:26.580 --> 24:28.360\n for good reasons, as we've seen in machine learning\n\n24:28.360 --> 24:30.580\n over the past couple years.\n\n24:30.580 --> 24:34.480\n And we're doing the same in our value creation market\n\n24:34.480 --> 24:36.020\n strategy.\n\n24:36.020 --> 24:39.220\n So collect more data, clean data,\n\n24:40.360 --> 24:42.960\n make the product such that the collection of data\n\n24:42.960 --> 24:47.960\n is easy and fun and then the rest will just spring to life.\n\n24:47.960 --> 24:50.540\n Through humans playing around with them.\n\n24:50.540 --> 24:54.020\n Our objective is to create the most valuable\n\n24:54.020 --> 24:59.020\n data collection system of the brain ever.\n\n25:01.340 --> 25:05.780\n And with that, then applying all the best tools\n\n25:05.780 --> 25:09.500\n of machine learning and other techniques\n\n25:09.500 --> 25:13.780\n to extract out, to try to find insight.\n\n25:13.780 --> 25:16.220\n But yes, our objective is really to systematize\n\n25:16.220 --> 25:19.900\n the discovery process because we can't put\n\n25:19.900 --> 25:22.020\n definite timeframes on discovery.\n\n25:22.020 --> 25:25.820\n The brain is complicated and science\n\n25:25.820 --> 25:28.140\n is not a business strategy.\n\n25:28.140 --> 25:30.540\n And so we really need to figure out how to,\n\n25:31.580 --> 25:34.060\n this is the difficulty of bringing technology\n\n25:34.060 --> 25:34.900\n like this to market.\n\n25:34.900 --> 25:38.300\n And it's why most of the time it just languishes\n\n25:38.300 --> 25:40.980\n in academia for quite some time.\n\n25:40.980 --> 25:44.060\n But we hope that we will cross over\n\n25:44.060 --> 25:48.960\n and make this mainstream in the coming years.\n\n25:48.960 --> 25:53.240\n The thing was cool to wear, but are you chasing\n\n25:53.240 --> 25:56.880\n a good reason for millions of people to put this\n\n25:56.880 --> 26:00.860\n on their head and keep on their head regularly?\n\n26:00.860 --> 26:04.740\n Is there, like who's going to discover that reason?\n\n26:04.740 --> 26:08.060\n Is it going to be people just kind of organically\n\n26:08.060 --> 26:12.520\n or is there going to be an Angry Birds style application\n\n26:12.520 --> 26:17.120\n that's just too exciting to not use?\n\n26:18.140 --> 26:20.940\n If I think through the things that have changed\n\n26:20.940 --> 26:23.500\n my life most significantly over the past few years,\n\n26:23.500 --> 26:27.140\n when I started wearing a wearable on my wrist\n\n26:27.140 --> 26:29.100\n that would give me data about my heart rate,\n\n26:29.100 --> 26:31.100\n heart rate variability, respiration rate,\n\n26:33.680 --> 26:36.140\n metabolic approximations, et cetera,\n\n26:37.180 --> 26:38.660\n for the first time in my life,\n\n26:38.660 --> 26:41.780\n I had access to information, sleep patterns\n\n26:41.780 --> 26:43.220\n that were highly impactful.\n\n26:43.220 --> 26:48.220\n They told me, for example, if I eat close to bedtime,\n\n26:48.620 --> 26:50.840\n I'm not going to get deep sleep.\n\n26:50.840 --> 26:52.760\n And not getting deep sleep means you have\n\n26:52.760 --> 26:54.420\n all these follow on consequences in life.\n\n26:54.420 --> 26:59.420\n And so it opened up this window of understanding of myself\n\n26:59.500 --> 27:03.180\n that I cannot self introspect and deduce these things.\n\n27:03.180 --> 27:06.180\n This is information that was available to be acquired,\n\n27:06.180 --> 27:07.060\n but it just wasn't.\n\n27:07.060 --> 27:08.840\n I would have to get an expensive sleep study,\n\n27:08.840 --> 27:10.460\n then it's an end, like one night,\n\n27:10.460 --> 27:12.500\n and that's not good enough to look at, to run all my trials.\n\n27:12.500 --> 27:15.340\n And so if you look just at the information\n\n27:15.340 --> 27:17.260\n that one can acquire on their wrist,\n\n27:18.220 --> 27:20.180\n and now you're applying it to the entire cortex\n\n27:20.180 --> 27:22.280\n on the brain and you say,\n\n27:22.280 --> 27:25.020\n what kind of information could we acquire?\n\n27:25.020 --> 27:28.360\n It opens up a whole new universe of possibilities.\n\n27:28.360 --> 27:30.140\n For example, we did this internal study at Kernel\n\n27:30.140 --> 27:31.660\n where I wore a prototype device\n\n27:32.540 --> 27:36.180\n and we were measuring the cognitive effects of sleep.\n\n27:36.180 --> 27:38.420\n So I had a device measuring my sleep.\n\n27:38.420 --> 27:41.740\n I performed with 13 of my coworkers.\n\n27:41.740 --> 27:45.740\n We performed four cognitive tasks over 13 sessions.\n\n27:45.740 --> 27:48.620\n And we focused on reaction time, impulse control,\n\n27:49.860 --> 27:52.780\n short term memory, and then a resting state task.\n\n27:52.780 --> 27:55.140\n And with mine, we found, for example,\n\n27:55.140 --> 28:00.140\n that my impulse control was independently correlated\n\n28:00.460 --> 28:02.320\n with my sleep outside of behavioral measures\n\n28:02.320 --> 28:04.100\n of my ability to play the game.\n\n28:04.100 --> 28:07.540\n The point of the study was I had,\n\n28:07.540 --> 28:12.060\n the brain study I did at Kernel confirmed my life experience\n\n28:12.060 --> 28:17.060\n that if I, my deep sleep determined whether or not\n\n28:18.040 --> 28:21.580\n I would be able to resist temptation the following day.\n\n28:21.580 --> 28:24.400\n And my brain did show that as one example.\n\n28:24.400 --> 28:25.700\n And so if you start thinking,\n\n28:25.700 --> 28:27.900\n if you actually have data on yourself,\n\n28:27.900 --> 28:30.880\n on your entire cortex and you can control the settings,\n\n28:32.180 --> 28:36.860\n I think there's probably a large number of things\n\n28:36.860 --> 28:37.980\n that we could discover about ourselves,\n\n28:37.980 --> 28:39.860\n very, very small and very, very big.\n\n28:39.860 --> 28:42.680\n I just, for example, like when you read news,\n\n28:43.580 --> 28:44.820\n what's going on?\n\n28:44.820 --> 28:47.620\n Like when you use social media, when you use news,\n\n28:47.620 --> 28:51.340\n like all the ways we allocate attention.\n\n28:51.340 --> 28:52.180\n That's right.\n\n28:52.180 --> 28:53.000\n With the computer.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:54.540\n I mean, that seems like a compelling place\n\n28:54.540 --> 28:58.260\n to where you would want to put on a Kernel,\n\n28:58.260 --> 28:59.180\n by the way, what is it called?\n\n28:59.180 --> 29:00.860\n Kernel Flux, Kernel, like what?\n\n29:00.860 --> 29:01.780\n Flow.\n\n29:01.780 --> 29:02.620\n Flow.\n\n29:02.620 --> 29:04.260\n We have two technologies, you or Flow.\n\n29:04.260 --> 29:05.540\n Flow, okay.\n\n29:05.540 --> 29:08.280\n So when you put on the Kernel Flow,\n\n29:11.020 --> 29:16.020\n it seems like to be a compelling time and place to do it\n\n29:16.300 --> 29:18.660\n is when you're behind a desk, behind a computer.\n\n29:18.660 --> 29:19.660\n Because you could probably wear it\n\n29:19.660 --> 29:23.740\n for prolonged periods of time as you're taking in content.\n\n29:23.740 --> 29:25.300\n And there could a lot of,\n\n29:25.300 --> 29:28.220\n because so much of our lives happens\n\n29:28.220 --> 29:29.960\n in the digital world now.\n\n29:29.960 --> 29:34.620\n That kind of coupling the information about the human mind\n\n29:34.620 --> 29:39.540\n with the consumption and the behaviors in the digital world\n\n29:39.540 --> 29:42.100\n might give us a lot of information about the effects\n\n29:42.100 --> 29:45.120\n of the way we behave and navigate the digital world\n\n29:45.120 --> 29:50.120\n to the actual physical meat space effects on our body.\n\n29:50.580 --> 29:51.420\n It's interesting to think,\n\n29:51.420 --> 29:53.580\n so in terms of both like for work,\n\n29:54.760 --> 29:59.740\n I'm a big fan of Cal Newport, his ideas of deep work\n\n29:59.740 --> 30:04.740\n that I spend, with few exceptions,\n\n30:05.020 --> 30:07.860\n I try to spend the first two hours of every day,\n\n30:07.860 --> 30:11.340\n usually if I'm like at home and have nothing on my schedule\n\n30:11.340 --> 30:15.020\n is going to be up to eight hours of deep work,\n\n30:15.020 --> 30:16.740\n of focus, zero distraction.\n\n30:16.740 --> 30:20.060\n And for me to analyze, I mean I'm very aware\n\n30:20.060 --> 30:24.780\n of the waning of that, the ups and downs of that.\n\n30:24.780 --> 30:27.940\n And it's almost like you're surfing the ups and downs\n\n30:27.940 --> 30:29.440\n of that as you're doing programming,\n\n30:29.440 --> 30:32.580\n as you're doing thinking about particular problems,\n\n30:32.580 --> 30:34.260\n you're trying to visualize things in your mind,\n\n30:34.260 --> 30:37.300\n you start trying to stitch them together.\n\n30:37.300 --> 30:40.960\n You're trying to, when there's a dead end about an idea,\n\n30:40.960 --> 30:45.520\n you have to kind of calmly like walk back and start again,\n\n30:45.520 --> 30:47.260\n all those kinds of processes.\n\n30:47.260 --> 30:49.020\n It'd be interesting to get data\n\n30:49.020 --> 30:51.100\n on what my mind is actually doing.\n\n30:51.100 --> 30:53.360\n And also recently started doing,\n\n30:53.360 --> 30:55.940\n I just talked to Sam Harris a few days ago\n\n30:55.940 --> 30:58.080\n and been building up to that.\n\n30:58.080 --> 31:01.900\n I started using, started meditating using his app,\n\n31:01.900 --> 31:05.340\n Waking Up, I very much recommend it.\n\n31:05.340 --> 31:07.500\n It'd be interesting to get data on that\n\n31:07.500 --> 31:10.540\n because it's, you're very, it's like you're removing\n\n31:10.540 --> 31:13.740\n all the noise from your head and you very much,\n\n31:13.740 --> 31:17.360\n it's an active process of active noise removal,\n\n31:18.340 --> 31:21.220\n active noise canceling like the headphones.\n\n31:21.220 --> 31:24.900\n And it'd be interesting to see what is going on in the mind\n\n31:24.900 --> 31:28.400\n before the meditation, during it and after,\n\n31:28.400 --> 31:29.240\n all those kinds of things.\n\n31:29.240 --> 31:31.280\n And all of your examples, it's interesting\n\n31:31.280 --> 31:35.400\n that everyone who's designed an experience for you,\n\n31:35.400 --> 31:38.520\n so whether it be the meditation app or the Deep Work\n\n31:38.520 --> 31:40.400\n or all the things you mentioned,\n\n31:40.400 --> 31:43.280\n they constructed this product\n\n31:43.280 --> 31:45.920\n with a certain number of knowns.\n\n31:45.920 --> 31:47.040\n Yeah.\n\n31:47.040 --> 31:50.580\n Now, what if we expanded the number of knowns by 10X\n\n31:50.580 --> 31:54.240\n or 20X or 30X, they would reconstruct their product\n\n31:54.240 --> 31:55.480\n or incorporate those knowns.\n\n31:55.480 --> 31:58.520\n So it'd be, and so this is the dimensionality\n\n31:58.520 --> 32:00.320\n that I think is the promising aspect\n\n32:00.320 --> 32:04.600\n is that people will be able to use this quantification,\n\n32:04.600 --> 32:09.260\n use this information to build more effective products.\n\n32:09.260 --> 32:11.360\n And this is, I'm not talking about better products\n\n32:11.360 --> 32:13.960\n to advertise to you or manipulate you.\n\n32:13.960 --> 32:17.820\n I'm talking about our focus is helping people,\n\n32:17.820 --> 32:20.360\n individuals have this contextual awareness\n\n32:20.360 --> 32:23.040\n and this quantification and then to engage with others\n\n32:23.040 --> 32:26.060\n who are seeking to improve people's lives,\n\n32:26.060 --> 32:31.060\n that the objective is betterment across ourselves,\n\n32:31.360 --> 32:33.480\n individually and also with each other.\n\n32:33.480 --> 32:35.000\n Yeah, so it's a nice data stream to have\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:36.120\n if you're building an app,\n\n32:36.120 --> 32:38.040\n like if you're building a podcast listening app,\n\n32:38.040 --> 32:40.320\n it would be nice to know data about the listener\n\n32:40.320 --> 32:42.820\n so that like if you're bored or you fell asleep,\n\n32:42.820 --> 32:46.000\n maybe pause the podcast, it's like really dumb,\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.400\n just very simple applications\n\n32:48.400 --> 32:50.640\n that could just improve the quality of the experience\n\n32:50.640 --> 32:52.000\n of using the app.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:56.680\n I'm imagining if you have your neural, this is Lex\n\n32:56.680 --> 32:59.880\n and there's a statistical representation of you\n\n32:59.880 --> 33:02.540\n and you engage with the app and it says,\n\n33:02.540 --> 33:07.540\n Lex, you're best to engage with this meditation exercise\n\n33:09.560 --> 33:11.040\n in the following settings.\n\n33:11.040 --> 33:14.020\n At this time of day, after eating this kind of food\n\n33:14.020 --> 33:17.380\n or not eating, fasting with this level of blood glucose\n\n33:17.380 --> 33:19.680\n and this kind of night's sleep.\n\n33:19.680 --> 33:23.000\n But all these data combined\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:26.600\n to give you this contextually relevant experience,\n\n33:26.600 --> 33:27.800\n just like we do with our sleep.\n\n33:27.800 --> 33:30.360\n You've optimized your entire life based upon\n\n33:30.360 --> 33:33.240\n what information you can acquire and know about yourself.\n\n33:34.240 --> 33:37.200\n And so the question is, how much do we really know\n\n33:37.200 --> 33:38.480\n of the things going around us?\n\n33:38.480 --> 33:41.520\n And I would venture to guess in my own life experience,\n\n33:41.520 --> 33:45.920\n I capture, my self awareness captures an extremely small\n\n33:45.920 --> 33:47.760\n percent of the things that actually influence\n\n33:47.760 --> 33:50.500\n my conscious and unconscious experience.\n\n33:50.500 --> 33:54.560\n Well, in some sense, the data would help encourage you\n\n33:54.560 --> 33:57.520\n to be more self aware, not just because you trust everything\n\n33:57.520 --> 34:02.520\n the data is saying, but it'll give you a prod\n\n34:02.820 --> 34:04.800\n to start investigating.\n\n34:04.800 --> 34:08.040\n Like I would love to get like a rating,\n\n34:08.040 --> 34:11.160\n like a ranking of all the things I do\n\n34:11.160 --> 34:13.800\n and what are the things, it's probably important to do\n\n34:13.800 --> 34:16.280\n without the data, but the data will certainly help.\n\n34:16.280 --> 34:19.840\n It's like rank all the things you do in life\n\n34:19.840 --> 34:21.800\n and which ones make you feel shitty,\n\n34:21.800 --> 34:23.600\n which ones make you feel good.\n\n34:23.600 --> 34:26.460\n Like you're talking about evening, Brian.\n\n34:26.460 --> 34:30.320\n Like this is a good example, somebody like,\n\n34:30.320 --> 34:32.680\n I do pig out at night as well.\n\n34:32.680 --> 34:35.840\n And it never makes me feel good.\n\n34:35.840 --> 34:37.400\n Like you're in a safe space.\n\n34:37.400 --> 34:40.440\n This is a safe space, let's hear it.\n\n34:40.440 --> 34:42.720\n No, I definitely have much less self control\n\n34:42.720 --> 34:44.400\n at night and it's interesting.\n\n34:44.400 --> 34:47.760\n And the same, people might criticize this,\n\n34:47.760 --> 34:50.000\n but I know my own body.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.800\n I know when I eat carnivores, just eat meat,\n\n34:52.800 --> 34:57.800\n I feel much better than if I eat more carbs.\n\n35:00.120 --> 35:02.300\n The more carbs I eat, the worse I feel.\n\n35:02.300 --> 35:04.160\n I don't know why that is.\n\n35:04.160 --> 35:05.260\n There is science supporting it,\n\n35:05.260 --> 35:06.640\n but I'm not leaning on science.\n\n35:06.640 --> 35:07.720\n I'm leaning on personal experience\n\n35:07.720 --> 35:09.360\n and that's really important.\n\n35:09.360 --> 35:12.560\n I don't need to read, I'm not gonna go on a whole rant\n\n35:12.560 --> 35:15.680\n about nutrition science, but many of those studies\n\n35:15.680 --> 35:17.160\n are very flawed.\n\n35:17.160 --> 35:19.420\n They're doing their best, but nutrition science\n\n35:19.420 --> 35:21.680\n is a very difficult field of study\n\n35:21.680 --> 35:24.200\n because humans are so different\n\n35:24.200 --> 35:26.120\n and the mind has so much impact\n\n35:26.120 --> 35:28.440\n on the way your body behaves.\n\n35:28.440 --> 35:30.800\n And it's so difficult from a scientific perspective\n\n35:30.800 --> 35:32.760\n to conduct really strong studies\n\n35:32.760 --> 35:36.960\n that you have to be almost like a scientist of one\n\n35:36.960 --> 35:39.020\n if to do these studies on yourself.\n\n35:39.020 --> 35:41.560\n That's the best way to understand what works for you or not.\n\n35:41.560 --> 35:44.560\n And I don't understand why, because it sounds unhealthy,\n\n35:44.560 --> 35:47.440\n but eating only meat always makes me feel good.\n\n35:47.440 --> 35:49.680\n Just eat meat, that's it.\n\n35:49.680 --> 35:52.880\n And I don't have any allergies, any of that kind of stuff.\n\n35:52.880 --> 35:54.520\n I'm not full like Jordan Peterson,\n\n35:54.520 --> 35:59.520\n where if he deviates a little bit from the carnivore diet,\n\n36:01.360 --> 36:03.200\n he goes off the cliff.\n\n36:03.200 --> 36:06.320\n No, I can have chocolate, I can go off the diet,\n\n36:06.320 --> 36:11.320\n I feel fine, it's a gradual worsening of how I feel.\n\n36:14.920 --> 36:17.080\n But when I eat only meat, I feel great.\n\n36:17.080 --> 36:19.280\n And it'd be nice to be reminded of that.\n\n36:19.280 --> 36:20.920\n Like there's a very simple fact\n\n36:21.920 --> 36:24.200\n that I feel good when I eat carnivore.\n\n36:24.200 --> 36:27.560\n And I think that repeats itself in all kinds of experiences.\n\n36:27.560 --> 36:32.560\n Like I feel really good when I exercise.\n\n36:32.560 --> 36:37.560\n I hate exercise, but in the rest of the day,\n\n36:39.760 --> 36:43.640\n the impact it has on my mind and the clarity of mind\n\n36:43.640 --> 36:45.800\n and the experiences and the happiness\n\n36:45.800 --> 36:48.040\n and all those kinds of things, I feel really good.\n\n36:48.040 --> 36:52.440\n And to be able to concretely express that through data\n\n36:52.440 --> 36:53.800\n would be nice.\n\n36:53.800 --> 36:55.840\n It would be a nice reminder, almost like a statement,\n\n36:55.840 --> 36:58.280\n like remember what feels good and whatnot.\n\n36:58.280 --> 37:01.800\n And there could be things like that,\n\n37:01.800 --> 37:04.560\n I'm not, many things that you're suggesting\n\n37:04.560 --> 37:07.000\n that I could not be aware of,\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:09.080\n that might be sitting right in front of me\n\n37:09.080 --> 37:12.160\n that make me feel really good and make me feel not good.\n\n37:12.160 --> 37:14.000\n And the data would show that.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:14.840\n I agree with you.\n\n37:14.840 --> 37:17.320\n I've actually employed the same strategy.\n\n37:17.320 --> 37:21.480\n I fired my mind entirely from being responsible\n\n37:21.480 --> 37:23.240\n for constructing my diet.\n\n37:23.240 --> 37:24.600\n And so I started doing a program\n\n37:24.600 --> 37:28.680\n where I now track over 200 biomarkers every 90 days.\n\n37:28.680 --> 37:31.800\n And it captures, of course, the things you would expect\n\n37:31.800 --> 37:34.360\n like cholesterol, but also DNA methylation\n\n37:34.360 --> 37:37.120\n and all kinds of things about my body,\n\n37:37.120 --> 37:39.360\n all the processes that make up me.\n\n37:39.360 --> 37:42.080\n And then I let that data generate the shopping lists.\n\n37:43.280 --> 37:45.560\n And so I never actually ask my mind what it wants.\n\n37:45.560 --> 37:48.360\n It's entirely what my body is reporting that it wants.\n\n37:48.360 --> 37:51.760\n And so I call this goal alignment within Brian.\n\n37:51.760 --> 37:53.480\n And there's 200 plus actors\n\n37:53.480 --> 37:55.240\n that I'm currently asking their opinion of.\n\n37:55.240 --> 37:57.800\n And so I'm asking my liver, how are you doing?\n\n37:57.800 --> 38:00.200\n And it's expressing via the biomarkers.\n\n38:00.200 --> 38:02.280\n And so that I construct that diet\n\n38:02.280 --> 38:06.160\n and I only eat those foods until my next testing round.\n\n38:06.160 --> 38:10.840\n And that has changed my life more than I think anything else\n\n38:10.840 --> 38:15.840\n because in the demotion of my conscious mind\n\n38:15.920 --> 38:18.000\n that I gave primacy to my entire life,\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:20.480\n it led me astray because like you were saying,\n\n38:20.480 --> 38:22.520\n the mind then goes out into the world\n\n38:22.520 --> 38:25.720\n and it navigates the dozens\n\n38:25.720 --> 38:29.080\n of different dietary regimens people put together in books.\n\n38:29.080 --> 38:32.760\n And it's all has their supporting science\n\n38:32.760 --> 38:35.720\n in certain contextual settings, but it's not N of one.\n\n38:35.720 --> 38:39.440\n And like you're saying, this dietary really is an N of one.\n\n38:39.440 --> 38:41.920\n What people have published scientifically of course\n\n38:41.920 --> 38:46.480\n can be used for nice groundings,\n\n38:46.480 --> 38:48.580\n but it changes when you get to an N of one level.\n\n38:48.580 --> 38:51.680\n And so that's what gets me excited about brain interfaces\n\n38:51.680 --> 38:54.640\n is if I could do the same thing for my brain\n\n38:54.640 --> 38:58.000\n where I can stop asking my conscious mind for its advice\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:01.520\n or for its decision making, which is flawed.\n\n39:01.520 --> 39:03.520\n And I'd rather just look at this data\n\n39:03.520 --> 39:05.640\n and I've never had better health markers in my life\n\n39:05.640 --> 39:08.000\n than when I stopped actually asking myself\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:09.680\n to be in charge of it.\n\n39:09.680 --> 39:13.840\n The idea of demotion of the conscious mind\n\n39:15.040 --> 39:20.040\n is such a sort of engineering way of phrasing meditation.\n\n39:21.680 --> 39:22.840\n That's what we're doing, right?\n\n39:22.840 --> 39:26.120\n That's beautiful, that means really beautifully put.\n\n39:26.120 --> 39:28.560\n By the way, testing round, what does that look like?\n\n39:28.560 --> 39:29.900\n What's that?\n\n39:29.900 --> 39:31.360\n Well, you mentioned.\n\n39:31.360 --> 39:33.240\n Yeah, the test I do.\n\n39:33.240 --> 39:34.080\n Yes.\n\n39:34.080 --> 39:37.560\n So it includes a complete blood panel.\n\n39:37.560 --> 39:39.040\n I do a microbiome test.\n\n39:39.040 --> 39:43.560\n I do a diet induced inflammation.\n\n39:43.560 --> 39:45.440\n So I look for exotokine expressions.\n\n39:45.440 --> 39:48.400\n So foods that produce inflammatory reactions.\n\n39:48.400 --> 39:50.120\n I look at my neuroendocrine systems.\n\n39:50.120 --> 39:53.000\n I look at all my neurotransmitters.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:57.440\n I do, yeah, there's several micronutrient tests\n\n39:57.440 --> 39:59.400\n to see how I'm looking at the various nutrients.\n\n39:59.400 --> 40:04.400\n What about self report of how you feel?\n\n40:04.500 --> 40:09.160\n Almost like, you can't demote your,\n\n40:09.160 --> 40:12.520\n you still exist within your conscious mind, right?\n\n40:12.520 --> 40:16.280\n So that lived experience is of a lot of value.\n\n40:16.280 --> 40:17.880\n So how do you measure that?\n\n40:17.880 --> 40:20.920\n I do a temporal sampling over some duration of time.\n\n40:20.920 --> 40:23.720\n So I'll think through how I feel over a week,\n\n40:23.720 --> 40:25.760\n over a month, over three months.\n\n40:25.760 --> 40:27.540\n I don't do a temporal sampling of\n\n40:27.540 --> 40:29.680\n if I'm at the grocery store in front of a cereal box\n\n40:29.680 --> 40:31.800\n and be like, you know what, Captain Crunch\n\n40:31.800 --> 40:33.320\n is probably the right thing for me today\n\n40:33.320 --> 40:36.560\n because I'm feeling like I need a little fun in my life.\n\n40:36.560 --> 40:37.640\n And so it's a temporal sampling.\n\n40:37.640 --> 40:38.840\n If the data sets large enough,\n\n40:38.840 --> 40:42.200\n then I smooth out the function of my natural oscillations\n\n40:42.200 --> 40:45.360\n of how I feel about life where some days I may feel upset\n\n40:45.360 --> 40:47.360\n or depressed or down or whatever.\n\n40:47.360 --> 40:48.920\n And I don't want those moments\n\n40:48.920 --> 40:50.480\n to then rule my decision making.\n\n40:50.480 --> 40:52.480\n That's why the demotion happens.\n\n40:52.480 --> 40:54.160\n And it says, really, if you're looking at\n\n40:54.160 --> 40:56.520\n health over a 90 day period of time,\n\n40:56.520 --> 41:00.040\n all my 200 voices speak up on that interval.\n\n41:00.040 --> 41:02.360\n And they're all given voice to say,\n\n41:02.360 --> 41:04.600\n this is how I'm doing and this is what I want.\n\n41:04.600 --> 41:07.120\n And so it really is an accounting system for everybody.\n\n41:07.120 --> 41:10.140\n So that's why I think that if you think about\n\n41:10.140 --> 41:11.740\n the future of being human,\n\n41:11.740 --> 41:16.740\n there's two things I think that are really going on.\n\n41:17.820 --> 41:20.020\n One is the design, manufacturing,\n\n41:20.020 --> 41:21.620\n and distribution of intelligence\n\n41:22.860 --> 41:25.620\n is heading towards zero on a cost curve\n\n41:26.740 --> 41:30.180\n over a certain design, over a certain timeframe\n\n41:30.180 --> 41:33.140\n that our ability to, you know, evolution produced us\n\n41:33.140 --> 41:35.580\n an intelligent form of intelligence.\n\n41:35.580 --> 41:38.580\n We are now designing our own intelligence systems\n\n41:38.580 --> 41:40.140\n and the design, manufacturing, distribution\n\n41:40.140 --> 41:42.860\n of that intelligence over a certain timeframe\n\n41:42.860 --> 41:45.100\n is going to go to a cost of zero.\n\n41:45.100 --> 41:48.060\n Design, manufacturing, distribution of intelligence\n\n41:48.060 --> 41:49.700\n cost is going to zero.\n\n41:49.700 --> 41:50.540\n For example.\n\n41:50.540 --> 41:52.540\n Again, just give me a second.\n\n41:52.540 --> 41:54.540\n That's brilliant, okay.\n\n41:54.540 --> 41:58.300\n And evolution is doing the design, manufacturing,\n\n41:58.300 --> 41:59.880\n distribution of intelligence.\n\n41:59.880 --> 42:02.380\n And now we are doing the design, manufacturing,\n\n42:02.380 --> 42:04.420\n distribution of intelligence.\n\n42:04.420 --> 42:06.660\n And the cost of that is going to zero.\n\n42:06.660 --> 42:10.780\n That's a very nice way of looking at life on Earth.\n\n42:10.780 --> 42:14.740\n So if that's going on and then now in parallel to that,\n\n42:15.580 --> 42:19.060\n then you say, okay, what then happens\n\n42:19.060 --> 42:23.420\n if when that cost curve is heading to zero?\n\n42:24.700 --> 42:28.780\n Our existence becomes a goal alignment problem,\n\n42:28.780 --> 42:31.340\n a goal alignment function.\n\n42:31.340 --> 42:33.060\n And so the same thing I'm doing\n\n42:33.060 --> 42:34.880\n where I'm doing goal alignment within myself\n\n42:34.880 --> 42:37.580\n of these 200 biomarkers, where I'm saying,\n\n42:37.580 --> 42:41.740\n when Brian exists on a daily basis\n\n42:41.740 --> 42:43.740\n and this entity is deciding what to eat\n\n42:43.740 --> 42:45.300\n and what to do and et cetera,\n\n42:45.300 --> 42:47.780\n it's not just my conscious mind, which is opining,\n\n42:47.780 --> 42:50.220\n it's 200 biological processes\n\n42:50.220 --> 42:52.140\n and there's a whole bunch of more voices involved.\n\n42:52.140 --> 42:55.460\n So in that equation,\n\n42:57.400 --> 43:02.060\n we're going to increasingly automate the things\n\n43:02.060 --> 43:05.340\n that we spend high energy on today because it's easier.\n\n43:05.340 --> 43:09.260\n And now we're going to then negotiate the terms\n\n43:09.260 --> 43:11.200\n and conditions of intelligent life.\n\n43:11.200 --> 43:13.180\n Now we say conscious existence because we're biased\n\n43:13.180 --> 43:15.100\n because that's what we have,\n\n43:15.100 --> 43:18.140\n but it will be the largest computational exercise\n\n43:18.140 --> 43:20.380\n in history because you're now doing goal alignment\n\n43:20.380 --> 43:24.100\n with planet Earth, within yourself, with each other,\n\n43:24.980 --> 43:26.900\n within all the intelligent agents we're building,\n\n43:26.900 --> 43:29.420\n bots and other voice assistants.\n\n43:29.420 --> 43:32.020\n You basically have a trillions and trillions of agents\n\n43:32.020 --> 43:35.860\n working on the negotiation of goal alignment.\n\n43:35.860 --> 43:39.180\n Yeah, this is in fact true.\n\n43:39.180 --> 43:40.580\n And what was the second thing?\n\n43:40.580 --> 43:41.420\n That was it.\n\n43:41.420 --> 43:44.300\n So the cost, the design, manufacturing, distribution\n\n43:44.300 --> 43:45.860\n of intelligence going to zero,\n\n43:45.860 --> 43:48.660\n which then means what's really going on?\n\n43:48.660 --> 43:50.180\n What are we really doing?\n\n43:50.180 --> 43:55.100\n We're negotiating the terms and conditions of existence.\n\n43:55.100 --> 43:59.220\n Do you worry about the survival of this process\n\n43:59.220 --> 44:04.220\n that life as we know it on Earth comes to an end\n\n44:04.900 --> 44:06.620\n or at least intelligent life,\n\n44:06.620 --> 44:11.580\n that as the cost goes to zero something happens\n\n44:11.580 --> 44:14.980\n where all of that intelligence is thrown in the trash\n\n44:14.980 --> 44:19.220\n by something like nuclear war or development of AGI systems\n\n44:19.220 --> 44:21.960\n that are very dumb, not AGI I guess,\n\n44:21.960 --> 44:25.380\n but AI systems, the paperclip thing,\n\n44:25.380 --> 44:28.980\n en masse is dumb but has unintended consequences\n\n44:28.980 --> 44:31.060\n where it destroys human civilization.\n\n44:31.060 --> 44:32.260\n Do you worry about those kinds of things?\n\n44:32.260 --> 44:37.140\n I mean, it's unsurprising that a new thing\n\n44:37.140 --> 44:40.980\n comes into the sphere of human consciousness.\n\n44:40.980 --> 44:43.020\n Humans identify the foreign object,\n\n44:43.020 --> 44:45.460\n in this case, artificial intelligence.\n\n44:45.460 --> 44:49.100\n Our amygdala fires up and says scary, foreign,\n\n44:50.660 --> 44:53.300\n we should be apprehensive about this.\n\n44:53.300 --> 44:57.020\n And so it makes sense from a biological perspective\n\n44:57.020 --> 45:00.960\n that humans, the knee jerk reaction is fear.\n\n45:02.060 --> 45:07.060\n What I don't think has been properly weighted with that\n\n45:08.260 --> 45:13.260\n is that we are the first generation of intelligent beings\n\n45:13.940 --> 45:17.260\n on this Earth that has been able to look out\n\n45:17.260 --> 45:18.900\n over their expected lifetime\n\n45:20.420 --> 45:23.420\n and see there is a real possibility of evolving\n\n45:23.420 --> 45:28.420\n into entirely novel forms of consciousness, so different\n\n45:28.780 --> 45:33.060\n that it would be totally unrecognizable to us today.\n\n45:33.060 --> 45:34.900\n We don't have words for it, we can't hint at it,\n\n45:34.900 --> 45:36.900\n we can't point at it, we can't,\n\n45:36.900 --> 45:38.460\n you can't look in the sky and see that thing\n\n45:38.460 --> 45:40.940\n that is shining, we're gonna go up there.\n\n45:40.940 --> 45:45.940\n You cannot even create an aspirational statement about it.\n\n45:46.780 --> 45:51.780\n And instead we've had this knee jerk reaction of fear\n\n45:51.780 --> 45:53.540\n about everything that could go wrong.\n\n45:53.540 --> 45:58.540\n But in my estimation, this should be the defining aspiration\n\n46:00.500 --> 46:04.540\n of all intelligent life on Earth that we would aspire,\n\n46:04.540 --> 46:08.020\n that basically every generation surveys the landscape\n\n46:08.020 --> 46:09.380\n of possibilities that are afforded,\n\n46:09.380 --> 46:10.980\n given the technological, cultural\n\n46:10.980 --> 46:14.500\n and other contextual situation that they're in.\n\n46:14.500 --> 46:17.940\n We're in this context, we haven't yet identified this\n\n46:17.940 --> 46:22.660\n and said, this is unbelievable, we should carefully\n\n46:22.660 --> 46:26.060\n think this thing through, not just of mitigating\n\n46:26.060 --> 46:27.100\n the things that'll wipe us out,\n\n46:27.100 --> 46:29.540\n but we have this potential,\n\n46:29.540 --> 46:31.580\n and so we just haven't given voice to it,\n\n46:31.580 --> 46:33.740\n even though it's within this realm of possibilities.\n\n46:33.740 --> 46:35.340\n So you're excited about the possibility\n\n46:35.340 --> 46:37.020\n of superintelligence systems\n\n46:37.020 --> 46:38.980\n and the opportunities that bring,\n\n46:38.980 --> 46:41.660\n I mean, there's parallels to this,\n\n46:41.660 --> 46:43.940\n you think about people before the internet\n\n46:43.940 --> 46:45.940\n as the internet was coming to life,\n\n46:45.940 --> 46:50.940\n I mean, there's kind of a fog through which you can't see,\n\n46:51.020 --> 46:52.620\n what does the future look like?\n\n46:54.340 --> 46:56.460\n Predicting collective intelligence,\n\n46:56.460 --> 46:57.740\n which I don't think we're understanding\n\n46:57.740 --> 46:59.300\n that we're living through that now,\n\n46:59.300 --> 47:03.100\n is that there's now, we've in some sense\n\n47:03.100 --> 47:05.580\n stopped being individual intelligences\n\n47:05.580 --> 47:09.420\n and become much more like collective intelligences,\n\n47:09.420 --> 47:13.780\n because ideas travel much, much faster now,\n\n47:13.780 --> 47:16.700\n and they can, in a viral way,\n\n47:16.700 --> 47:18.940\n sweep across the populations,\n\n47:18.940 --> 47:23.340\n and so it's almost, I mean, it almost feels like\n\n47:23.340 --> 47:26.500\n a thought is had by many people now,\n\n47:26.500 --> 47:27.940\n thousands or millions of people\n\n47:27.940 --> 47:29.780\n as opposed to an individual person,\n\n47:29.780 --> 47:30.860\n and that's changed everything,\n\n47:30.860 --> 47:33.060\n but to me, I don't think we're realizing\n\n47:33.060 --> 47:36.220\n how much that actually changed people or societies,\n\n47:36.220 --> 47:38.980\n but to predict that before the internet\n\n47:38.980 --> 47:41.220\n would have been very difficult,\n\n47:41.220 --> 47:43.220\n and in that same way, we're sitting here\n\n47:43.220 --> 47:45.300\n with the fog before us, thinking,\n\n47:45.300 --> 47:49.620\n what is superintelligence systems,\n\n47:49.620 --> 47:51.780\n how is that going to change the world?\n\n47:51.780 --> 47:54.740\n What is increasing the bandwidth,\n\n47:54.740 --> 47:59.380\n like plugging our brains into this whole thing,\n\n47:59.380 --> 48:01.340\n how is that going to change the world?\n\n48:01.340 --> 48:05.740\n And it seems like it's a fog, you don't know,\n\n48:05.740 --> 48:10.740\n and it could be, it could, whatever comes to be,\n\n48:10.820 --> 48:12.460\n could destroy the world,\n\n48:12.460 --> 48:13.940\n we could be the last generation,\n\n48:14.980 --> 48:18.100\n but it also could transform in ways\n\n48:18.100 --> 48:23.100\n that creates an incredibly fulfilling life experience\n\n48:24.500 --> 48:27.380\n that's unlike anything we've ever experienced.\n\n48:27.380 --> 48:30.420\n It might involve dissolution of ego and consciousness\n\n48:30.420 --> 48:32.620\n and so on, you're no longer one individual,\n\n48:32.620 --> 48:35.980\n it might be more, you know,\n\n48:35.980 --> 48:38.900\n that might be a certain kind of death, an ego death,\n\n48:38.900 --> 48:42.220\n but the experience might be really exciting and enriching,\n\n48:42.220 --> 48:44.020\n maybe we'll live in a virtual,\n\n48:44.020 --> 48:47.020\n like it's like, it's funny to think about\n\n48:48.100 --> 48:49.900\n a bunch of sort of hypothetical questions\n\n48:49.900 --> 48:54.900\n of would it be more fulfilling to live in a virtual world?\n\n48:57.820 --> 48:59.540\n Like if you were able to plug your brain in\n\n48:59.540 --> 49:02.700\n in a very dense way into a video game,\n\n49:03.580 --> 49:05.700\n like which world would you want to live in?\n\n49:05.700 --> 49:08.860\n In the video game or in the physical world?\n\n49:08.860 --> 49:12.940\n For most of us, we're kind of toying it\n\n49:12.940 --> 49:14.100\n with the idea of the video game,\n\n49:14.100 --> 49:16.060\n but we still want to live in the physical world,\n\n49:16.060 --> 49:20.060\n have friendships and relationships in the physical world,\n\n49:20.060 --> 49:23.380\n but we don't know that, again, it's a fog,\n\n49:23.380 --> 49:25.460\n and maybe in 100 years,\n\n49:25.460 --> 49:27.180\n we're all living inside a video game,\n\n49:27.180 --> 49:29.060\n hopefully not Call of Duty,\n\n49:29.060 --> 49:33.060\n hopefully more like Sims 5, which version is it on?\n\n49:33.940 --> 49:36.060\n For you individually though,\n\n49:36.060 --> 49:39.940\n does it make you sad that your brain ends?\n\n49:41.620 --> 49:44.340\n That you die one day very soon?\n\n49:45.900 --> 49:49.220\n That the whole thing, that data source\n\n49:49.220 --> 49:53.620\n just goes offline sooner than you would like?\n\n49:54.660 --> 49:56.060\n That's a complicated question.\n\n49:56.060 --> 49:59.180\n I would have answered it differently\n\n49:59.180 --> 50:00.620\n in different times in my life.\n\n50:00.620 --> 50:03.300\n I had chronic depression for 10 years,\n\n50:03.300 --> 50:06.060\n and so in that 10 year time period,\n\n50:06.060 --> 50:09.140\n I desperately wanted lights to be off,\n\n50:09.140 --> 50:11.060\n and the thing that made it even worse\n\n50:11.060 --> 50:15.860\n is I was in a religious, I was born into a religion.\n\n50:15.860 --> 50:17.780\n It was the only reality I ever understood,\n\n50:17.780 --> 50:20.340\n and it's difficult to articulate to people\n\n50:20.340 --> 50:22.180\n when you're born into that kind of reality\n\n50:22.180 --> 50:24.860\n and it's the only reality you're exposed to,\n\n50:24.860 --> 50:28.220\n you are literally blinded to the existence of other realities\n\n50:28.220 --> 50:31.460\n because it's so much the in group, out group thing,\n\n50:31.460 --> 50:33.820\n and so in that situation,\n\n50:33.820 --> 50:37.300\n it was not only that I desperately wanted lights out forever,\n\n50:37.300 --> 50:38.860\n it was that I couldn't have lights out forever.\n\n50:38.860 --> 50:40.700\n It was that there was an afterlife,\n\n50:40.700 --> 50:45.460\n and this afterlife had this system\n\n50:45.460 --> 50:50.460\n that would either penalize or reward you for your behaviors,\n\n50:50.500 --> 50:52.420\n and so it was almost like this,\n\n50:53.860 --> 50:57.820\n this indescribable hopelessness\n\n50:57.820 --> 51:01.060\n of not only being in hopeless despair\n\n51:01.060 --> 51:02.180\n of not wanting to exist,\n\n51:02.180 --> 51:05.180\n but then also being forced to exist,\n\n51:05.180 --> 51:06.780\n and so there was a duration of my time,\n\n51:06.780 --> 51:08.620\n a duration of life where I'd say,\n\n51:08.620 --> 51:13.300\n like yes, I have no remorse for lights being out,\n\n51:13.300 --> 51:15.380\n and I actually want it more than anything\n\n51:15.380 --> 51:16.380\n in the entire world.\n\n51:18.700 --> 51:21.260\n There are other times where I'm looking out at the future\n\n51:21.260 --> 51:24.980\n and I say this is an opportunity\n\n51:24.980 --> 51:27.860\n for a future evolving human conscious experience\n\n51:27.860 --> 51:31.540\n that is beyond my ability to understand,\n\n51:31.540 --> 51:34.380\n and I jump out of bed and I race to work\n\n51:34.380 --> 51:37.620\n and I can't think about anything else,\n\n51:37.620 --> 51:42.620\n but I think the reality for me is,\n\n51:44.300 --> 51:45.740\n I don't know what it's like to be in your head,\n\n51:45.740 --> 51:48.980\n but in my head, when I wake up in the morning,\n\n51:48.980 --> 51:52.900\n I don't say good morning, Brian, I'm so happy to see you.\n\n51:52.900 --> 51:55.980\n Like I'm sure you're just gonna be beautiful to me today.\n\n51:55.980 --> 51:57.620\n You're not gonna make a huge long list\n\n51:57.620 --> 51:59.140\n of everything you should be anxious about.\n\n51:59.140 --> 52:01.420\n You're not gonna repeat that list to me 400 times.\n\n52:01.420 --> 52:03.060\n You're not gonna have me relive\n\n52:03.060 --> 52:04.660\n all the regrets I've made in life.\n\n52:04.660 --> 52:06.060\n I'm sure you're not doing any of that.\n\n52:06.060 --> 52:08.900\n You're just gonna just help me along all day long.\n\n52:08.900 --> 52:11.820\n I mean, it's a brutal environment in my brain,\n\n52:11.820 --> 52:15.580\n and we've just become normalized to this environment\n\n52:15.580 --> 52:18.420\n that we just accept that this is what it means to be human,\n\n52:18.420 --> 52:21.820\n but if we look at it, if we try to muster\n\n52:21.820 --> 52:24.100\n as much soberness as we can\n\n52:24.100 --> 52:27.260\n about the realities of being human, it's brutal.\n\n52:27.260 --> 52:31.940\n If it is for me, and so am I sad\n\n52:31.940 --> 52:34.100\n that the brain may be off one day?\n\n52:37.060 --> 52:38.300\n It depends on the contextual setting.\n\n52:38.300 --> 52:39.140\n Like how am I feeling?\n\n52:39.140 --> 52:40.540\n At what moment are you asking me that?\n\n52:40.540 --> 52:42.460\n And my mind is so fickle.\n\n52:42.460 --> 52:45.180\n And this is why, again, I don't trust my conscious mind.\n\n52:45.180 --> 52:47.500\n I have been given realities.\n\n52:47.500 --> 52:51.540\n I was given a religious reality that was a video game.\n\n52:51.540 --> 52:54.540\n And then I figured out it was not a real reality.\n\n52:54.540 --> 52:56.260\n And then I lived in a depressive reality,\n\n52:56.260 --> 52:59.740\n which delivered this terrible hopelessness.\n\n52:59.740 --> 53:00.780\n That wasn't a real reality.\n\n53:00.780 --> 53:03.180\n Then I discovered behavioral psychology,\n\n53:03.180 --> 53:06.420\n and I figured out how biased, 188 chronicle biases,\n\n53:06.420 --> 53:08.900\n and how my brain is distorting reality all the time.\n\n53:08.900 --> 53:11.300\n I have gone from one reality to another.\n\n53:11.300 --> 53:13.580\n I don't trust reality.\n\n53:13.580 --> 53:15.860\n I don't trust realities are given to me.\n\n53:15.860 --> 53:17.540\n And so to try to make a decision\n\n53:17.540 --> 53:20.620\n on what I value or not value that future state,\n\n53:20.620 --> 53:22.020\n I don't trust my response.\n\n53:22.020 --> 53:27.020\n So not fully listening to the conscious mind\n\n53:28.260 --> 53:31.020\n at any one moment as the ultimate truth,\n\n53:31.020 --> 53:33.780\n but allowing it to go up and down as it does,\n\n53:33.780 --> 53:35.300\n and just kind of being observing it.\n\n53:35.300 --> 53:38.780\n Yes, I assume that whatever my conscious mind delivers up\n\n53:38.780 --> 53:43.220\n to my awareness is wrong upon landing.\n\n53:43.220 --> 53:45.060\n And I just need to figure out where it's wrong,\n\n53:45.060 --> 53:46.900\n how it's wrong, how wrong it is,\n\n53:46.900 --> 53:49.260\n and then try to correct for it as best I can.\n\n53:49.260 --> 53:52.380\n But I assume that on impact,\n\n53:52.380 --> 53:55.620\n it's mistaken in some critical ways.\n\n53:55.620 --> 53:58.340\n Is there something you can say by way of advice\n\n53:59.340 --> 54:00.860\n when the mind is depressive,\n\n54:00.860 --> 54:03.700\n when the conscious mind serves up something that,\n\n54:06.300 --> 54:08.980\n dark thoughts, how you deal with that,\n\n54:08.980 --> 54:11.100\n like how in your own life you've overcome that,\n\n54:11.100 --> 54:14.480\n and others who are experiencing that can overcome it?\n\n54:15.500 --> 54:16.340\n Two things.\n\n54:16.340 --> 54:21.340\n One, those depressive states are biochemical states.\n\n54:25.660 --> 54:27.660\n It's not you.\n\n54:28.700 --> 54:31.540\n And the suggestions that these things,\n\n54:31.540 --> 54:33.060\n that this state delivers to you\n\n54:33.060 --> 54:35.100\n about suggestion of the hopelessness of life\n\n54:35.100 --> 54:37.420\n or the meaninglessness of it,\n\n54:37.420 --> 54:41.260\n or that you should hit the eject button,\n\n54:42.380 --> 54:44.020\n that's a false reality.\n\n54:44.020 --> 54:47.660\n And that it's when,\n\n54:47.660 --> 54:51.980\n I completely understand the rational decision\n\n54:51.980 --> 54:53.340\n to commit suicide.\n\n54:53.340 --> 54:55.180\n It is not lost on me at all\n\n54:55.180 --> 54:57.340\n that that is an irrational situation,\n\n54:57.340 --> 54:59.780\n but the key is when you're in that situation\n\n54:59.780 --> 55:01.720\n and those thoughts are landing,\n\n55:01.720 --> 55:04.880\n to be able to say, thank you, you're not real.\n\n55:06.660 --> 55:08.140\n I know you're not real.\n\n55:08.140 --> 55:10.620\n And so I'm in a situation where for whatever reason\n\n55:10.620 --> 55:13.740\n I'm having this neurochemical state,\n\n55:13.740 --> 55:16.300\n but that state can be altered.\n\n55:16.300 --> 55:18.620\n And so again, it goes back to the realities\n\n55:18.620 --> 55:21.240\n of the difficulties of being human.\n\n55:21.240 --> 55:22.940\n And like when I was trying to solve my depression,\n\n55:22.940 --> 55:27.900\n I tried literally, you name it, I tried it systematically,\n\n55:27.900 --> 55:29.380\n and nothing would fix it.\n\n55:29.380 --> 55:32.320\n And so this is what gives me hope with brain interfaces,\n\n55:32.320 --> 55:35.420\n for example, like, could I have numbers on my brain?\n\n55:35.420 --> 55:36.500\n Can I see what's going on?\n\n55:36.500 --> 55:38.260\n Because I go to the doctor and it's like,\n\n55:38.260 --> 55:39.100\n how do you feel?\n\n55:39.100 --> 55:41.360\n I don't know, terrible.\n\n55:41.360 --> 55:42.200\n Like on a scale from one to 10,\n\n55:42.200 --> 55:43.460\n how bad do you want to commit suicide?\n\n55:43.460 --> 55:44.300\n 10.\n\n55:45.680 --> 55:48.420\n Okay, here's his bottle.\n\n55:48.420 --> 55:49.260\n How much should I take?\n\n55:49.260 --> 55:51.060\n Well, I don't know, like just.\n\n55:51.060 --> 55:52.900\n Yeah, it's very, very crude.\n\n55:52.900 --> 55:55.060\n And this data opens up the,\n\n55:56.540 --> 56:00.300\n yeah, it opens up the possibility of really helping\n\n56:00.300 --> 56:03.460\n in those dark moments to first understand\n\n56:03.460 --> 56:06.080\n the ways, the ups and downs of those dark moments.\n\n56:06.080 --> 56:07.880\n On the complete flip side of that,\n\n56:07.880 --> 56:12.880\n right, I am very conscious in my own brain\n\n56:14.880 --> 56:19.120\n and deeply, deeply grateful that what there,\n\n56:19.120 --> 56:23.000\n it's almost like a chemistry thing, a biochemistry thing\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:26.080\n that I go many times throughout the day.\n\n56:26.080 --> 56:31.080\n I'll look at like this cup and I'll be overcome with joy\n\n56:31.720 --> 56:34.120\n how amazing it is to be alive.\n\n56:34.120 --> 56:37.440\n Like I actually think my biochemistry is such\n\n56:37.440 --> 56:42.440\n that it's not as common, like I've talked to people\n\n56:42.440 --> 56:44.660\n and I don't think that's that common.\n\n56:44.660 --> 56:48.220\n Like it's a, and it's not a rational thing at all.\n\n56:48.220 --> 56:51.920\n It's like, I feel like I'm on drugs\n\n56:51.920 --> 56:54.160\n and I'll just be like, whoa.\n\n56:55.120 --> 56:57.400\n And a lot of people talk about like the meditative\n\n56:57.400 --> 56:59.960\n experience will allow you to sort of, you know,\n\n56:59.960 --> 57:02.840\n look at some basic things like the movement of your hand\n\n57:02.840 --> 57:06.240\n as deeply joyful because it's like, that's life.\n\n57:06.240 --> 57:08.480\n But I get that from just looking at a cup.\n\n57:08.480 --> 57:10.000\n Like I'm waiting for the coffee to brew\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:15.000\n and I'll just be like, fuck, life is awesome.\n\n57:15.080 --> 57:17.440\n And I'll sometimes tweet that, but then I'll like regret\n\n57:17.440 --> 57:20.040\n it later, like, God damn it, you're so ridiculous.\n\n57:20.040 --> 57:24.880\n But yeah, so, but that is purely chemistry.\n\n57:24.880 --> 57:27.400\n Like there's no rational, it doesn't fit\n\n57:27.400 --> 57:28.240\n with the rest of my life.\n\n57:28.240 --> 57:30.760\n I have all this shit, I'm always late to stuff.\n\n57:30.760 --> 57:32.680\n I'm always like, there's all this stuff, you know,\n\n57:32.680 --> 57:35.640\n I'm super self critical, like really self critical\n\n57:35.640 --> 57:38.840\n about everything I do, to the point I almost hate\n\n57:38.840 --> 57:41.840\n everything I do, but there's this engine of joy\n\n57:41.840 --> 57:43.480\n for life outside of all that.\n\n57:43.480 --> 57:45.200\n And that has to be chemistry.\n\n57:45.200 --> 57:48.480\n And this flip side of that is what depression probably is,\n\n57:48.480 --> 57:53.520\n is the opposite of that feeling of like,\n\n57:53.520 --> 57:57.680\n cause I bet you that feeling of the cup being amazing\n\n57:57.680 --> 58:01.000\n would save anybody in a state of depression.\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.840\n Like that would be like fresh, you're in a desert\n\n58:03.840 --> 58:08.160\n and it's a drink of water, shit man.\n\n58:08.160 --> 58:11.560\n The brain is a, it would be nice to understand\n\n58:11.560 --> 58:16.560\n where that's coming from, to be able to understand\n\n58:17.440 --> 58:19.240\n how you hit those lows and those highs\n\n58:19.240 --> 58:21.840\n that have nothing to do with the actual reality.\n\n58:21.840 --> 58:24.280\n It has to do with some very specific aspects\n\n58:25.320 --> 58:28.440\n of how you maybe see the world, maybe,\n\n58:28.440 --> 58:31.040\n it could be just like basic habits that you engage in\n\n58:31.040 --> 58:34.120\n and then how to walk along the line to find\n\n58:34.120 --> 58:35.560\n those experiences of joy.\n\n58:35.560 --> 58:37.440\n And this goes back to the discussion we're having\n\n58:37.440 --> 58:42.440\n of human cognition is in volume, the largest input\n\n58:43.120 --> 58:44.840\n of raw material into society.\n\n58:45.960 --> 58:47.840\n And it's not quantified.\n\n58:47.840 --> 58:50.200\n We have no bearings on it.\n\n58:50.200 --> 58:55.200\n And so we just, you wonder, we both articulated\n\n58:55.720 --> 58:58.640\n some of the challenges we have in our own mind.\n\n58:58.640 --> 59:02.280\n And it's likely that others would say,\n\n59:02.280 --> 59:03.840\n I have something similar.\n\n59:03.840 --> 59:05.920\n And you wonder when you look at society,\n\n59:08.920 --> 59:11.520\n how does that contribute to all the other compounder\n\n59:11.520 --> 59:12.760\n problems that we're experiencing?\n\n59:12.760 --> 59:16.760\n How does that blind us to the opportunities\n\n59:16.760 --> 59:18.560\n we could be looking at?\n\n59:18.560 --> 59:23.560\n And so it really, it has this potential distortion effect\n\n59:24.040 --> 59:27.080\n on reality that just makes everything worse.\n\n59:27.080 --> 59:30.160\n And I hope if we can put some,\n\n59:30.160 --> 59:34.560\n if we can assign some numbers to these things\n\n59:34.560 --> 59:36.280\n and just to get our bearings,\n\n59:36.280 --> 59:38.040\n so we're aware of what's going on,\n\n59:38.040 --> 59:40.120\n if we could find greater stabilization\n\n59:40.120 --> 59:42.760\n in how we conduct our lives and how we build society,\n\n59:46.160 --> 59:49.520\n it might be the thing that enables us to scaffold.\n\n59:50.480 --> 59:52.560\n Because we've really, again, we've done it,\n\n59:52.560 --> 59:53.920\n humans have done a fantastic job\n\n59:53.920 --> 59:58.160\n systematically scaffolding technology\n\n59:58.160 --> 1:00:00.400\n and science and institutions.\n\n1:00:00.400 --> 1:00:02.840\n It's human, it's our own selves,\n\n1:00:02.840 --> 1:00:05.360\n which we have not been able to scaffold.\n\n1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:08.440\n We are the one part of this intelligence infrastructure\n\n1:00:08.440 --> 1:00:09.700\n that remains unchanged.\n\n1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:15.160\n Is there something you could say about coupling\n\n1:00:15.160 --> 1:00:19.640\n this brain data with not just the basic human experience,\n\n1:00:19.640 --> 1:00:22.640\n but say an experience, you mentioned sleep,\n\n1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:26.560\n but the wildest experience, which is psychedelics,\n\n1:00:26.560 --> 1:00:29.920\n is there, and there's been quite a few studies now\n\n1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:33.400\n that are being approved and run,\n\n1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:36.520\n which is exciting from a scientific perspective\n\n1:00:36.520 --> 1:00:38.120\n on psychedelics.\n\n1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:40.840\n Do you think, what do you think happens\n\n1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:42.320\n to the brain on psychedelics?\n\n1:00:44.480 --> 1:00:47.440\n And how can data about this help us understand it?\n\n1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:50.640\n And when you're on DMT, do you see Ls?\n\n1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:53.560\n And can we convert that into data?\n\n1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:56.400\n Can you add aliens in there?\n\n1:00:56.400 --> 1:00:57.640\n Yeah, aliens, definitely.\n\n1:00:57.640 --> 1:00:58.760\n Do you actually meet aliens?\n\n1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:00.600\n And Ls, are Ls the aliens?\n\n1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:04.100\n I'm asking for a few Austin friends, yeah,\n\n1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:08.940\n that are convinced that they've actually met the Ls.\n\n1:01:08.940 --> 1:01:09.780\n What are Ls like?\n\n1:01:09.780 --> 1:01:11.000\n Are they friendly?\n\n1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:11.840\n Are they help?\n\n1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:12.680\n I haven't met them personally.\n\n1:01:12.680 --> 1:01:15.240\n Are they like the smurfs of like they're industrious\n\n1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:17.200\n and they have different skill sets and?\n\n1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:20.680\n Yeah, I think they're very,\n\n1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:24.880\n they're very critical as friends.\n\n1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:26.240\n They're trolls.\n\n1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:27.300\n The Ls are trolls.\n\n1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:30.200\n No, but they care about you.\n\n1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:33.760\n So there's a bunch of different version of trolls.\n\n1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:37.400\n There's loving trolls that are harsh on you,\n\n1:01:37.400 --> 1:01:38.640\n but they want you to be better.\n\n1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:42.680\n And there's trolls that just enjoy your destruction.\n\n1:01:42.680 --> 1:01:45.280\n And I think they're the ones that care for you.\n\n1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:47.560\n I think they're a criticism for my,\n\n1:01:47.560 --> 1:01:49.320\n see, I haven't met them directly,\n\n1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:51.120\n so it's like a friend of a friend.\n\n1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:53.280\n Yeah, they gave him a telephone.\n\n1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:54.720\n Yeah, a bit of a,\n\n1:01:54.720 --> 1:01:57.440\n and the whole point is that in psychedelics,\n\n1:01:57.440 --> 1:01:59.520\n and certainly at DMT,\n\n1:01:59.520 --> 1:02:04.520\n word, this is where the brain data versus word data fails,\n\n1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:08.240\n which is, you know, words can't convey the experience.\n\n1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:10.560\n Most people that, you can be poetic and so on,\n\n1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:12.320\n but it really does not convey the experience\n\n1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:15.800\n of what it actually means to meet the Ls.\n\n1:02:15.800 --> 1:02:18.960\n I mean, to me, what baselines this conversation is,\n\n1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:23.200\n imagine if we were interested in the health of your heart,\n\n1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:28.520\n and we started and said, okay, Lex, self interest back,\n\n1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:30.040\n tell me how's the health of your heart.\n\n1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:31.760\n And you sit there and you close your eyes\n\n1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:36.640\n and you think, feels all right, like things feel okay.\n\n1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:38.320\n And then you went to the cardiologist\n\n1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:39.760\n and the cardiologist is like, hey Lex,\n\n1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:41.040\n you know, tell me how you feel.\n\n1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:43.360\n You're like, well, actually, what I'd really like you to do\n\n1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:47.440\n is do an EKG and a blood panel and look at arterial plaques\n\n1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:49.360\n and let's look at my cholesterol.\n\n1:02:49.360 --> 1:02:53.240\n And there's like five to 10 studies you would do.\n\n1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:54.480\n They would then give you this report and say,\n\n1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:58.080\n here's the quantified health of your heart.\n\n1:02:58.080 --> 1:02:59.840\n Now with this data,\n\n1:02:59.840 --> 1:03:03.120\n I'm going to prescribe the following regime of exercise\n\n1:03:03.120 --> 1:03:06.160\n and maybe I'll put you on a statin, like, et cetera.\n\n1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:08.560\n But the protocol is based upon this data.\n\n1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:11.560\n You would think the cardiologist is out of their mind\n\n1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:14.320\n if they just gave you a bottle of statins based upon,\n\n1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:16.240\n you're like, well, I think something's kind of wrong.\n\n1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:20.080\n And they're just kind of experiment and see what happens.\n\n1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:22.600\n But that's what we do with our mental health today.\n\n1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:25.080\n So it's kind of absurd.\n\n1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:28.160\n And so if you look at psychedelics to have,\n\n1:03:28.160 --> 1:03:29.440\n again, to be able to measure the brain\n\n1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:31.520\n and get a baseline state,\n\n1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:33.880\n and then to measure during a psychedelic experience\n\n1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:35.160\n and post the psychedelic experience\n\n1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:37.160\n and then do it longitudinally,\n\n1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:39.440\n you now have a quantification of what's going on.\n\n1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:41.720\n And so you could then pose questions,\n\n1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:45.040\n what molecule is appropriate at what dosages,\n\n1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:47.720\n at what frequency, in what contextual environment,\n\n1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:50.080\n what happens when I have this diet with this molecule,\n\n1:03:50.080 --> 1:03:51.320\n with this experience,\n\n1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:52.640\n all the experimentation you do\n\n1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:55.560\n when you have good sleep data or HRV.\n\n1:03:55.560 --> 1:03:57.720\n And so that's what I think happens,\n\n1:03:57.720 --> 1:04:00.400\n what we could potentially do with psychedelics\n\n1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:03.080\n is we could add this level of sophistication\n\n1:04:03.080 --> 1:04:05.200\n that is not in the industry currently.\n\n1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:09.000\n And it may improve the outcomes people experience,\n\n1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.560\n it may improve the safety and efficacy.\n\n1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:14.120\n And so that's what I hope we are able to achieve.\n\n1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:19.040\n And it would transform mental health\n\n1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:21.200\n because we would finally have numbers\n\n1:04:21.200 --> 1:04:22.480\n to work with to baseline ourselves.\n\n1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:24.080\n And then if you think about it,\n\n1:04:25.080 --> 1:04:26.800\n when we talk about things related to the mind,\n\n1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:28.280\n we talk about the modality.\n\n1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:30.480\n We use words like meditation or psychedelics\n\n1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:32.000\n or something else,\n\n1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.120\n because we can't talk about a marker in the brain.\n\n1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:35.920\n We can't use a word to say,\n\n1:04:35.920 --> 1:04:36.960\n we can't talk about cholesterol.\n\n1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:38.320\n We don't talk about plaque in the arteries.\n\n1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:40.440\n We don't talk about HRV.\n\n1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:41.440\n And so if we have numbers,\n\n1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:45.440\n then the solutions get mapped to numbers\n\n1:04:45.440 --> 1:04:47.640\n instead of the modalities being the thing we talk about.\n\n1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:51.320\n Meditation just does good things in a crude fashion.\n\n1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:53.720\n So in your blog post,\n\n1:04:53.720 --> 1:04:56.040\n Zero Principle Thinking, good title,\n\n1:04:56.040 --> 1:04:57.600\n you ponder how do people come up\n\n1:04:57.600 --> 1:04:59.760\n with truly original ideas.\n\n1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:02.800\n What's your thoughts on this as a human\n\n1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:05.600\n and as a person who's measuring brain data?\n\n1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:09.520\n Zero principles are building blocks.\n\n1:05:09.520 --> 1:05:14.440\n First principles are understanding of system laws.\n\n1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:17.320\n So if you take, for example, like in Sherlock Holmes,\n\n1:05:17.320 --> 1:05:18.800\n he's a first principles thinker.\n\n1:05:18.800 --> 1:05:23.800\n So he says, once you've eliminated the impossible,\n\n1:05:25.120 --> 1:05:29.000\n anything that remains, however improbable, is true.\n\n1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.600\n Whereas Dirk Gently, the holistic detective\n\n1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:33.840\n by Douglas Adams says,\n\n1:05:33.840 --> 1:05:36.440\n I don't like eliminating the impossible.\n\n1:05:36.440 --> 1:05:38.040\n So when someone says,\n\n1:05:38.040 --> 1:05:40.480\n from a first principles perspective,\n\n1:05:42.280 --> 1:05:47.000\n and they're trying to assume the fewest number of things\n\n1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:48.680\n within a given timeframe.\n\n1:05:50.080 --> 1:05:53.880\n And so when I, after Braintree Venmo,\n\n1:05:54.760 --> 1:05:57.760\n I set my mind to the question of,\n\n1:05:57.760 --> 1:06:00.880\n what single thing can I do that would maximally increase\n\n1:06:00.880 --> 1:06:02.880\n the probability that the human race thrives\n\n1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:05.120\n beyond what we can even imagine?\n\n1:06:05.120 --> 1:06:08.600\n And I found that in my conversations with others\n\n1:06:08.600 --> 1:06:11.680\n in the books I read, in my own deliberations,\n\n1:06:12.560 --> 1:06:14.400\n I had a missing piece of the puzzle,\n\n1:06:15.280 --> 1:06:17.440\n because I didn't feel like,\n\n1:06:17.440 --> 1:06:22.440\n yeah, I didn't feel like the future could be deduced\n\n1:06:22.440 --> 1:06:24.480\n from first principles thinking.\n\n1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:27.040\n And that's when I read the book, Zero,\n\n1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:29.400\n A Biography of a Dangerous Idea.\n\n1:06:29.400 --> 1:06:30.240\n And I...\n\n1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:32.800\n It's a really good book, by the way.\n\n1:06:32.800 --> 1:06:34.720\n I think it's my favorite book I've ever read.\n\n1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:37.080\n It's also a really interesting number, zero.\n\n1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:40.000\n And I wasn't aware that the number zero\n\n1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:40.840\n had to be discovered.\n\n1:06:40.840 --> 1:06:43.800\n I didn't realize that it caused a revolution in philosophy\n\n1:06:43.800 --> 1:06:46.880\n and just tore up math and it tore up,\n\n1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:48.600\n I mean, it builds modern society,\n\n1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:51.640\n but it wrecked everything in its way.\n\n1:06:51.640 --> 1:06:55.440\n It was an unbelievable disruptor, and it was so difficult\n\n1:06:55.440 --> 1:06:57.840\n for society to get their heads around it.\n\n1:06:57.840 --> 1:07:00.240\n And so zero is, of course,\n\n1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:03.440\n the representation of a zero principle thinking,\n\n1:07:03.440 --> 1:07:06.400\n which is it's the caliber\n\n1:07:06.400 --> 1:07:08.760\n and consequential nature of an idea.\n\n1:07:09.960 --> 1:07:13.560\n And so when you talk about what kind of ideas\n\n1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:19.160\n have civilization transforming properties,\n\n1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:21.840\n oftentimes they fall in the zeroth category.\n\n1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:24.680\n And so in thinking this through,\n\n1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:28.320\n I was wanting to find a quantitative structure\n\n1:07:28.320 --> 1:07:31.720\n on how to think about these zeroth principles.\n\n1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:33.640\n And that's, so I came up with that\n\n1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:37.200\n to be a coupler with first principles thinking.\n\n1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:39.680\n And so now it's a staple as part of how I think about\n\n1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:41.640\n the world and the future.\n\n1:07:41.640 --> 1:07:44.040\n So it emphasizes trying to identify,\n\n1:07:44.040 --> 1:07:46.320\n it lands on that word impossible.\n\n1:07:46.320 --> 1:07:50.080\n Like what is impossible, essentially trying to identify\n\n1:07:50.080 --> 1:07:52.200\n what is impossible and what is possible.\n\n1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:57.200\n And being as, how do you, I mean, this is the thing,\n\n1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:01.000\n is most of society tells you the range of things\n\n1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:02.960\n they say is impossible is very wide.\n\n1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:04.760\n So you need to be shrinking that.\n\n1:08:04.760 --> 1:08:08.560\n I mean, that's the whole process of this kind of thinking\n\n1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:13.560\n is you need to be very rigorous in thinking about\n\n1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:17.800\n and be very rigorous in trying to be,\n\n1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:22.240\n trying to draw the lines of what is actually impossible\n\n1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:26.400\n because very few things are actually impossible.\n\n1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:28.480\n I don't know what is actually impossible.\n\n1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:33.040\n Like it's the Joe Rogan, it's entirely possible.\n\n1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:37.280\n I like that approach to science, to engineering,\n\n1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:40.560\n to entrepreneurship, it's entirely possible.\n\n1:08:40.560 --> 1:08:43.400\n Basically shrink the impossible to zero,\n\n1:08:43.400 --> 1:08:45.400\n to a very small set.\n\n1:08:45.400 --> 1:08:50.400\n Yeah, life constraints favor first principle thinking\n\n1:08:50.680 --> 1:08:55.200\n because it enables faster action\n\n1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:57.600\n with higher probability of success.\n\n1:08:57.600 --> 1:09:00.920\n Pursuing zero with principle optionality\n\n1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:02.600\n is expensive and uncertain.\n\n1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:06.120\n And so in a society constrained by resources,\n\n1:09:06.120 --> 1:09:10.080\n time and money and a desire for social status,\n\n1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:13.640\n accomplishment, et cetera, it minimizes zero\n\n1:09:13.640 --> 1:09:14.480\n with principle thinking.\n\n1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:16.800\n But the reason why I think zero with principle thinking\n\n1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:21.800\n should be a staple of our shared cognitive infrastructure\n\n1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:24.760\n is if you look through the history\n\n1:09:24.760 --> 1:09:26.160\n of the past couple of thousand years\n\n1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:29.960\n and let's just say we arbitrarily,\n\n1:09:29.960 --> 1:09:33.840\n we subjectively try to assess what is a zero level idea.\n\n1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:37.880\n And we say how many have occurred on what time scales\n\n1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:40.120\n and what were the contextual settings for it?\n\n1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:43.360\n I would argue that if you look at AlphaGo,\n\n1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:48.680\n when it played Go from another dimension,\n\n1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:53.480\n with the human Go players, when it saw AlphaGo's moves,\n\n1:09:53.480 --> 1:09:55.720\n it attributed to like playing with an alien,\n\n1:09:55.720 --> 1:10:00.120\n playing Go with AlphaGo being from another dimension.\n\n1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:04.320\n And so if you say computational intelligence\n\n1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:09.320\n has an attribute of introducing zero like insights,\n\n1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:14.320\n then if you say what is going to be the occurrence\n\n1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:16.960\n of zeros in society going forward?\n\n1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:19.560\n And you could reasonably say\n\n1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:21.440\n probably a lot more than have occurred\n\n1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:24.160\n and probably more at a faster pace.\n\n1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:25.000\n So then if you say,\n\n1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:28.160\n what happens if you have this computational intelligence\n\n1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:30.680\n throughout society that the manufacturing design\n\n1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:31.600\n and distribution of intelligence\n\n1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:33.760\n is now going to heading towards zero,\n\n1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:37.040\n you have an increased number of zeros being produced\n\n1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:40.360\n with a tight connection between human and computers.\n\n1:10:41.320 --> 1:10:43.280\n That's when I got to a point and said,\n\n1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:45.560\n we cannot predict the future\n\n1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:47.480\n with first principles thinking.\n\n1:10:47.480 --> 1:10:50.360\n We can't, that cannot be our imagination set.\n\n1:10:50.360 --> 1:10:55.360\n It can't be our sole anchor in the situation\n\n1:10:55.400 --> 1:10:57.520\n that basically the future of our conscious existence,\n\n1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:01.400\n 20, 30, 40, 50 years is probably a zero.\n\n1:11:01.400 --> 1:11:06.400\n So just to clarify, when you say zero,\n\n1:11:06.920 --> 1:11:11.480\n you're referring to basically a truly revolutionary idea.\n\n1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:17.000\n Yeah, something that is currently not a building block\n\n1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:21.400\n of our shared conscious existence,\n\n1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:23.080\n either in the form of knowledge.\n\n1:11:24.480 --> 1:11:26.560\n Yeah, it's currently not manifest\n\n1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:28.520\n in what we acknowledge.\n\n1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:32.440\n So zero principle thinking is playing with ideas\n\n1:11:32.440 --> 1:11:37.440\n that are so revolutionary that we can't even clearly reason\n\n1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:42.000\n about the consequences once those ideas come to be.\n\n1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.040\n Yeah, or for example, like Einstein,\n\n1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:49.520\n that was a zeroeth, I would categorize it\n\n1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:51.400\n as a zeroeth principle insight.\n\n1:11:51.400 --> 1:11:53.000\n You mean general relativity, space time.\n\n1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000\n Yeah, space time, yep, yep.\n\n1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:59.080\n That basically building upon what Newton had done\n\n1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:04.080\n and said, yes, also, and it just changed the fabric\n\n1:12:04.920 --> 1:12:06.680\n of our understanding of reality.\n\n1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:09.720\n And so that was unexpected, it existed.\n\n1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:13.240\n We just, it became part of our awareness\n\n1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:16.720\n and the moves AlphaGo made existed.\n\n1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:19.080\n It just came into our awareness.\n\n1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:24.080\n And so to your point, there's this question\n\n1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:27.800\n of what do we know and what don't we know?\n\n1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:30.160\n Do we think we know 99% of all things\n\n1:12:30.160 --> 1:12:33.760\n or do we think we know 0.001% of all things?\n\n1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:35.760\n And that goes back to no known, no unknowns\n\n1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:37.000\n and unknown unknowns.\n\n1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000\n And first principles and zero principle thinking\n\n1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:42.240\n gives us a quantitative framework to say,\n\n1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:44.640\n there's no way for us to mathematically\n\n1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:47.240\n try to create probabilities for these things.\n\n1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:50.200\n Therefore, it would be helpful\n\n1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:52.920\n if they were just part of our standard thought processes\n\n1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:57.920\n because it may encourage different behaviors\n\n1:12:58.360 --> 1:13:01.320\n in what we do individually, collectively as a society,\n\n1:13:01.320 --> 1:13:03.480\n what we aspire to, what we talk about,\n\n1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:05.680\n the possibility sets we imagine.\n\n1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:09.080\n Yeah, I've been engaged in that kind of thinking\n\n1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:14.080\n quite a bit and thinking about engineering of consciousness.\n\n1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:17.400\n I think it's feasible, I think it's possible\n\n1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:19.240\n in the language that we're using here.\n\n1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:21.680\n And it's very difficult to reason about a world\n\n1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:26.680\n when inklings of consciousness can be engineered\n\n1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:29.800\n into artificial systems.\n\n1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:33.440\n Not from a philosophical perspective,\n\n1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:35.600\n but from an engineering perspective,\n\n1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:39.720\n I believe a good step towards engineering consciousness\n\n1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:44.360\n is creating engineering the illusion of consciousness.\n\n1:13:44.360 --> 1:13:49.360\n So I'm captivated by our natural predisposition\n\n1:13:51.920 --> 1:13:53.920\n to anthropomorphize things.\n\n1:13:55.280 --> 1:13:56.640\n And I think that's what we,\n\n1:13:58.760 --> 1:14:00.720\n I don't wanna hear from the philosophers,\n\n1:14:00.720 --> 1:14:04.720\n but I think that's what we kind of do to each other.\n\n1:14:05.640 --> 1:14:10.640\n That consciousness is created socially,\n\n1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:14.640\n that like much of the power of consciousness\n\n1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:16.600\n is in the social interaction.\n\n1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:19.720\n I create your consciousness, no,\n\n1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:23.120\n I create my consciousness by having interacted with you.\n\n1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.320\n And that's the display of consciousness.\n\n1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:28.640\n It's the same as like the display of emotion.\n\n1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:31.480\n Emotion is created through communication.\n\n1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:34.720\n Language is created through its use.\n\n1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:36.560\n And then we somehow humans kind of,\n\n1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:39.400\n especially philosophers, the hard problem of consciousness\n\n1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:40.840\n or the hard problem of consciousness,\n\n1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:44.480\n really wanna believe that we possess this thing.\n\n1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:49.480\n That's like there's an elf sitting there with a hat\n\n1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:52.680\n or like name tag says consciousness,\n\n1:14:52.680 --> 1:14:57.640\n and they're like feeding this subjective experience to us\n\n1:14:57.640 --> 1:15:02.160\n as opposed to like it actually being an illusion\n\n1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:05.480\n that we construct to make social communication more effective.\n\n1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:09.440\n And so I think if you focus on creating the illusion\n\n1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:11.160\n of consciousness, you can create\n\n1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:14.840\n some very fulfilling experiences in software.\n\n1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:18.760\n And so that to me is a compelling space of ideas to explore.\n\n1:15:18.760 --> 1:15:19.600\n I agree with you.\n\n1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:21.680\n And I think going back to our experience together\n\n1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:23.280\n with Brain Interfaces on,\n\n1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:26.080\n you could imagine if we get to a certain level of maturity.\n\n1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:28.760\n So first let's take the inverse of this.\n\n1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:30.720\n So you and I text back and forth\n\n1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:33.120\n and we're sending each other emojis.\n\n1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:37.080\n That has a certain amount of information transfer rate\n\n1:15:37.080 --> 1:15:39.280\n as we're communicating with each other.\n\n1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:41.920\n And so in our communication with people via email\n\n1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:42.760\n and texts and whatnot,\n\n1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:46.880\n we've taken the bandwidth of human interaction,\n\n1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:49.920\n the information transfer rate, and we've reduced it.\n\n1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:51.480\n We have less social cues.\n\n1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:53.000\n We have less information to work with.\n\n1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.280\n There's a lot more opportunity for misunderstanding.\n\n1:15:55.280 --> 1:15:57.480\n So that is altering the conscious experience\n\n1:15:57.480 --> 1:15:59.400\n between two individuals.\n\n1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:01.600\n And if we add Brain Interfaces to the equation,\n\n1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:04.120\n let's imagine now we amplify the dimensionality\n\n1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:05.560\n of our communications.\n\n1:16:05.560 --> 1:16:07.240\n That to me is what you're talking about,\n\n1:16:07.240 --> 1:16:09.120\n which is consciousness engineering.\n\n1:16:09.120 --> 1:16:13.360\n Perhaps I understand you with dimensions.\n\n1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:15.160\n So maybe I understand your,\n\n1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:17.640\n when you look at the cup and you experience that happiness,\n\n1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:18.640\n you can tell me you're happy.\n\n1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:20.520\n And I then do theory of mine and say,\n\n1:16:20.520 --> 1:16:23.160\n I can imagine what it might be like to be Lex\n\n1:16:23.160 --> 1:16:25.320\n and feel happy about seeing this cup.\n\n1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:26.760\n But if the interface could then quantify\n\n1:16:26.760 --> 1:16:30.080\n and give me a 50 vector space model and say,\n\n1:16:30.080 --> 1:16:32.640\n this is the version of happiness that Lex is experiencing\n\n1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:34.240\n as he looked at this cup,\n\n1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:36.440\n then it would allow me potentially\n\n1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:38.040\n to have much greater empathy for you\n\n1:16:38.040 --> 1:16:39.120\n and understand you as a human.\n\n1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:41.880\n This is how you experience joy,\n\n1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:44.160\n which is entirely unique from how I experienced joy,\n\n1:16:44.160 --> 1:16:46.080\n even though we assumed ahead of time\n\n1:16:46.080 --> 1:16:48.120\n that we're having some kind of similar experience.\n\n1:16:48.120 --> 1:16:51.520\n But I agree with you that we do consciousness engineering\n\n1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:52.800\n today in everything we do.\n\n1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:55.760\n When we talk to each other, when we're building products\n\n1:16:55.760 --> 1:17:00.280\n and that we're entering into a stage where\n\n1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:02.200\n it will be much more methodical\n\n1:17:03.160 --> 1:17:06.200\n and quantitative based and computational\n\n1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:07.280\n in how we go about doing it.\n\n1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:09.120\n Which to me, I find encouraging\n\n1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:12.320\n because I think it creates better guardrails\n\n1:17:14.360 --> 1:17:18.760\n to create ethical systems versus right now,\n\n1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:21.200\n I feel like it's really a wild, wild west\n\n1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:23.440\n on how these interactions are happening.\n\n1:17:23.440 --> 1:17:25.600\n Yeah, and it's funny you focus on human to human,\n\n1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:29.240\n but that this kind of data enables human to machine\n\n1:17:29.240 --> 1:17:33.520\n interaction, which is what we're kind of talking about\n\n1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:35.480\n when we say engineering consciousness.\n\n1:17:36.440 --> 1:17:39.040\n And that will happen, of course,\n\n1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:40.520\n let's flip that on its head.\n\n1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:44.520\n Right now we're putting humans as the central node.\n\n1:17:44.520 --> 1:17:48.600\n What if we gave GPT3 a bunch of human brains\n\n1:17:48.600 --> 1:17:52.760\n and said, hey, GPT3, learn some manners when you speak.\n\n1:17:52.760 --> 1:17:54.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:17:54.080 --> 1:17:56.520\n And run your algorithms on humans brains\n\n1:17:56.520 --> 1:17:58.560\n and see how they respond.\n\n1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:01.720\n So you can be polite and so that you can be friendly\n\n1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:04.640\n and so that you can be conversationally appropriate,\n\n1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:09.240\n but to inverse it, to give our machines a training set\n\n1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:11.800\n in real time with closed loop feedback\n\n1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:15.280\n so that our machines were better equipped to\n\n1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:19.760\n find their way through our society\n\n1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:22.360\n in polite and kind and appropriate ways.\n\n1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:23.200\n I love that idea.\n\n1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:25.560\n Or better yet, teach it some,\n\n1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:30.040\n have it read the following documents\n\n1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:32.120\n and have it visit Austin and Texas.\n\n1:18:32.120 --> 1:18:34.640\n And so that when you ask, when you tell it,\n\n1:18:34.640 --> 1:18:36.600\n why don't you learn some manners,\n\n1:18:36.600 --> 1:18:38.720\n GPT3 learns to say no.\n\n1:18:41.120 --> 1:18:43.600\n It learns what it means to be free\n\n1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:45.320\n and a sovereign individual.\n\n1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:47.440\n So that, it depends.\n\n1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:50.200\n So it depends what kind of a version of GPT3 you want.\n\n1:18:50.200 --> 1:18:52.720\n One that's free, one that behaves well with the social.\n\n1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:54.760\n Viva la revolution.\n\n1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:59.760\n You want a socialist GPT3, you want an anarchist GPT3,\n\n1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:03.320\n you want a polite, like you take it home\n\n1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:06.680\n to visit mom and dad GPT3 and you want like party\n\n1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:11.200\n and like Vegas to a strip club GPT3, you want all flavors.\n\n1:19:11.200 --> 1:19:14.200\n And then you've gotta have goal alignment between all those.\n\n1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:19.200\n Yeah, they don't want to manipulate each other for sure.\n\n1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:24.640\n So that's, I mean, you kind of spoke to ethics.\n\n1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:28.600\n One of the concerns that people have in this modern world,\n\n1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:32.000\n the digital data is that of privacy and security.\n\n1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:35.920\n But privacy, they're concerned that when they share data,\n\n1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:40.840\n it's the same thing with you when we trust other human beings\n\n1:19:40.840 --> 1:19:44.200\n in being fragile and revealing something\n\n1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:47.320\n that we're vulnerable about.\n\n1:19:48.200 --> 1:19:51.960\n There's a leap of faith, there's a leap of trust\n\n1:19:51.960 --> 1:19:54.240\n that that's going to be just between us.\n\n1:19:54.240 --> 1:19:55.360\n There's a privacy to it.\n\n1:19:55.360 --> 1:19:58.280\n And then the challenge is when you're in the digital space\n\n1:19:58.280 --> 1:20:01.680\n then sharing your data with companies\n\n1:20:01.680 --> 1:20:03.680\n that use that data for advertisement\n\n1:20:03.680 --> 1:20:05.080\n and all those kinds of things,\n\n1:20:05.080 --> 1:20:08.480\n there's a hesitancy to share that much data,\n\n1:20:08.480 --> 1:20:10.760\n to share a lot of deep personal data.\n\n1:20:10.760 --> 1:20:14.080\n And if you look at brain data, that feels a whole lot\n\n1:20:14.080 --> 1:20:17.800\n like it's richly, deeply personal data.\n\n1:20:17.800 --> 1:20:20.080\n So how do you think about privacy\n\n1:20:20.080 --> 1:20:22.160\n with this kind of ocean of data?\n\n1:20:22.160 --> 1:20:26.120\n I think we got off to a wrong start with the internet\n\n1:20:26.120 --> 1:20:31.120\n where the basic rules of play for the company that be was,\n\n1:20:33.920 --> 1:20:36.000\n if you're a company, you can go out\n\n1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:39.120\n and get as much information on a person\n\n1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:42.960\n as you can find without their approval.\n\n1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:46.360\n And you can also do things to induce them\n\n1:20:46.360 --> 1:20:48.080\n to give you as much information.\n\n1:20:48.080 --> 1:20:50.960\n And you don't need to tell them what you're doing with it.\n\n1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:52.320\n You can do anything on the backside,\n\n1:20:52.320 --> 1:20:54.920\n you can make money on it, but the game is\n\n1:20:54.920 --> 1:20:56.800\n who can acquire the most information\n\n1:20:56.800 --> 1:21:00.400\n and devise the most clever schemes to do it.\n\n1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:01.920\n That was a bad starting place.\n\n1:21:02.800 --> 1:21:05.720\n And so we are in this period\n\n1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:07.560\n where we need to correct for that.\n\n1:21:07.560 --> 1:21:09.760\n And we need to say, first of all,\n\n1:21:09.760 --> 1:21:14.760\n the individual always has control over their data.\n\n1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:15.840\n It's not a free for all.\n\n1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:17.520\n It's not like a game of hungry hippo,\n\n1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:20.200\n but they can just go out and grab as much as they want.\n\n1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:22.480\n So for example, when your brain data was recorded today,\n\n1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:24.240\n the first thing we did in the kernel app\n\n1:21:24.240 --> 1:21:27.680\n was you have control over your data.\n\n1:21:27.680 --> 1:21:31.320\n And so it's individual consent, it's individual control.\n\n1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:33.280\n And then you can build up on top of that,\n\n1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:36.480\n but it has to be based upon some clear rules of play\n\n1:21:36.480 --> 1:21:39.200\n if everyone knows what's being collected,\n\n1:21:39.200 --> 1:21:40.600\n they know what's being done with it,\n\n1:21:40.600 --> 1:21:42.120\n and the person has control over it.\n\n1:21:42.120 --> 1:21:43.760\n So transparency and control.\n\n1:21:43.760 --> 1:21:46.920\n So everybody knows what does control look like,\n\n1:21:46.920 --> 1:21:48.840\n my ability to delete the data if I want.\n\n1:21:48.840 --> 1:21:51.040\n Yeah, delete it and to know who is being shared with\n\n1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:53.200\n under what terms and conditions.\n\n1:21:53.200 --> 1:21:55.760\n We haven't reached that level of sophistication\n\n1:21:55.760 --> 1:21:59.800\n with our products of if you say, for example,\n\n1:22:00.800 --> 1:22:04.360\n hey Spotify, please give me a customized playlist\n\n1:22:04.360 --> 1:22:08.120\n according to my neurome, you could say,\n\n1:22:08.120 --> 1:22:10.760\n you can have access to this vector space model,\n\n1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:12.360\n but only for this duration of time\n\n1:22:12.360 --> 1:22:15.240\n and then you've got to delete it.\n\n1:22:15.240 --> 1:22:16.920\n We haven't gotten there to that level of sophistication,\n\n1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:19.320\n but these are ideas we need to start talking about\n\n1:22:19.320 --> 1:22:22.200\n of how would you actually structure permissions?\n\n1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:23.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:22:23.040 --> 1:22:26.240\n And I think it creates a much more stable set\n\n1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:31.080\n for society to build where we understand the rules of play\n\n1:22:31.080 --> 1:22:34.720\n and people aren't vulnerable to being taken advantage.\n\n1:22:34.720 --> 1:22:39.720\n It's not fair for an individual to be taken advantage of\n\n1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:42.200\n without their awareness with some other practice\n\n1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:44.600\n that some company is doing for their sole benefit.\n\n1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:46.680\n And so hopefully we are going through a process now\n\n1:22:46.680 --> 1:22:48.240\n where we're correcting for these things\n\n1:22:48.240 --> 1:22:53.240\n and that it can be an economy wide shift that,\n\n1:22:54.880 --> 1:22:59.360\n because really these are fundamentals\n\n1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:01.280\n we need to have in place.\n\n1:23:01.280 --> 1:23:05.000\n It's kind of fun to think about like in Chrome\n\n1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:07.800\n when you install an extension or like install an app,\n\n1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:10.560\n it's ask you like what permissions you're willing to give\n\n1:23:10.560 --> 1:23:13.160\n and be cool if in the future it says like,\n\n1:23:13.160 --> 1:23:15.120\n you can have access to my brain data.\n\n1:23:16.920 --> 1:23:20.440\n I mean, it's not unimaginable in the future\n\n1:23:21.560 --> 1:23:24.440\n that the big technology companies have built a business\n\n1:23:24.440 --> 1:23:26.200\n based upon acquiring data about you\n\n1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:27.720\n that they can then create a view to model of you\n\n1:23:27.720 --> 1:23:29.480\n and sell that predictability.\n\n1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:31.520\n And so it's not unimaginable that you will create\n\n1:23:31.520 --> 1:23:33.920\n with like kernel device, for example,\n\n1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:37.280\n a more reliable predictor of you than they could.\n\n1:23:37.280 --> 1:23:39.200\n And that they're asking you for permission\n\n1:23:39.200 --> 1:23:41.000\n to complete their objectives and you're the one\n\n1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:43.960\n that gets to negotiate that with them and say, sure.\n\n1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:47.740\n But so it's not unimaginable that might be the case.\n\n1:23:49.040 --> 1:23:52.760\n So there's a guy named Dela Musk and he has a company\n\n1:23:52.760 --> 1:23:55.360\n in one of the many companies called Neuralink\n\n1:23:55.360 --> 1:23:59.160\n that's also excited about the brain.\n\n1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:01.440\n So it'd be interesting to hear your kind of opinions\n\n1:24:01.440 --> 1:24:03.800\n about a very different approach that's invasive,\n\n1:24:03.800 --> 1:24:06.940\n that require surgery, that implants,\n\n1:24:06.940 --> 1:24:09.040\n a data collection device in the brain.\n\n1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:10.840\n How do you think about the difference between kernel\n\n1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:15.120\n and Neuralink in the approaches of getting\n\n1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:17.440\n that stream of brain data?\n\n1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:20.460\n Elon and I spoke about this a lot early on.\n\n1:24:20.460 --> 1:24:24.320\n We met up, I had started kernel and he had an interest\n\n1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:25.560\n in brain interfaces as well.\n\n1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:28.320\n And we explored doing something together,\n\n1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:31.900\n him joining kernel and ultimately it wasn't the right move.\n\n1:24:31.900 --> 1:24:35.320\n And so he started Neuralink and I continued building kernel,\n\n1:24:35.320 --> 1:24:39.160\n but it was interesting because we were both\n\n1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:44.160\n at this very early time where it wasn't certain\n\n1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:47.700\n if there was a path to pursue,\n\n1:24:49.020 --> 1:24:51.080\n if now was the right time to do something\n\n1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:53.080\n and then the technological choice of doing that.\n\n1:24:53.080 --> 1:24:54.960\n And so we were both,\n\n1:24:54.960 --> 1:24:58.200\n our starting point was looking at invasive technologies.\n\n1:24:58.200 --> 1:25:01.380\n And I was building invasive technology at the time.\n\n1:25:01.380 --> 1:25:03.080\n That's ultimately where he's gone.\n\n1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:08.840\n Little less than a year after Elon and I were engaged,\n\n1:25:08.840 --> 1:25:11.480\n I shifted kernel to do noninvasive.\n\n1:25:12.440 --> 1:25:15.200\n And we had this neuroscientist come to kernel.\n\n1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:16.040\n We were talking about,\n\n1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:17.680\n he had been doing neural surgery for 30 years,\n\n1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:20.160\n one of the most respected neuroscientists in the US.\n\n1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:21.900\n And we brought him to kernel to figure out\n\n1:25:21.900 --> 1:25:23.520\n the ins and outs of his profession.\n\n1:25:23.520 --> 1:25:26.160\n And at the very end of our three hour conversation,\n\n1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:30.280\n he said, you know, every 15 or so years,\n\n1:25:30.280 --> 1:25:34.720\n a new technology comes along that changes everything.\n\n1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:37.360\n He said, it's probably already here.\n\n1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:38.660\n You just can't see it yet.\n\n1:25:39.700 --> 1:25:40.800\n And my jaw dropped.\n\n1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:44.600\n I thought, because I had spoken to Bob Greenberg\n\n1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:48.240\n who had built a second site first on the optical nerve\n\n1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:53.240\n and then he did an array on the optical cortex.\n\n1:25:53.280 --> 1:25:57.280\n And then I also became friendly with Neuropace\n\n1:25:57.280 --> 1:25:59.800\n who does the implants for seizure detection\n\n1:25:59.800 --> 1:26:01.560\n and remediation.\n\n1:26:01.560 --> 1:26:06.560\n And I saw in their eyes what it was like\n\n1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:10.040\n to take something through an implantable device\n\n1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:11.760\n through for a 15 year run.\n\n1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:13.800\n They initially thought it was seven years\n\n1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:15.160\n and ended up being 15 years.\n\n1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:16.240\n And they thought it'd be a hundred million\n\n1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:18.960\n because it was 300, 400 million.\n\n1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:22.280\n And I really didn't want to build invasive technology.\n\n1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:25.680\n It was the only thing that appeared to be possible.\n\n1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:28.640\n But then once I spun up an internal effort\n\n1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:30.400\n to start looking at noninvasive options,\n\n1:26:30.400 --> 1:26:32.000\n we said, is there something here?\n\n1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.700\n Is there anything here that again has the characteristics\n\n1:26:34.700 --> 1:26:37.280\n of it has the high quality data,\n\n1:26:37.280 --> 1:26:39.240\n it could be low cost, it could be accessible.\n\n1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:42.200\n Could it make brain interfaces mainstream?\n\n1:26:42.200 --> 1:26:43.860\n And so I did a bet the company move.\n\n1:26:43.860 --> 1:26:47.520\n We shifted from noninvasive to invasive to noninvasive.\n\n1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:49.020\n So the answer is yes to that.\n\n1:26:49.020 --> 1:26:51.600\n There is something there that's possible.\n\n1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:52.680\n The answer is we'll see.\n\n1:26:52.680 --> 1:26:55.080\n We've now built both technologies\n\n1:26:55.080 --> 1:26:58.100\n and they're now you experienced one of them today.\n\n1:26:58.100 --> 1:27:02.560\n We were applying, we're now deploying it.\n\n1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:04.640\n So we're trying to figure out what value is really there.\n\n1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:07.680\n But I'd say it's really too early to express confidence.\n\n1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:12.680\n Whether it's too, I think it's too early to assess\n\n1:27:12.680 --> 1:27:17.600\n which technological choice is the right one\n\n1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:19.240\n on what time scales.\n\n1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:20.680\n Yeah, time scales are really important here.\n\n1:27:20.680 --> 1:27:22.240\n Very important because if you look at the,\n\n1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:24.280\n like on the invasive side,\n\n1:27:24.280 --> 1:27:27.000\n there's so much activity going on right now\n\n1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:32.000\n of less invasive techniques to get at the neuron firings,\n\n1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:36.840\n which would what Neuralink is building.\n\n1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:39.840\n It's possible that in 10, 15 years\n\n1:27:39.840 --> 1:27:40.960\n when they're scaling that technology,\n\n1:27:40.960 --> 1:27:42.480\n other things have come along.\n\n1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:44.000\n And you'd much rather do that.\n\n1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:45.740\n That thing starts to clock again.\n\n1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:47.480\n It may not be the case.\n\n1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:48.520\n It may be the case that Neuralink\n\n1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:50.760\n has properly chosen the right technology\n\n1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:53.080\n and that that's exactly what they want to be.\n\n1:27:53.080 --> 1:27:53.960\n Totally possible.\n\n1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:55.680\n And it's also possible that the path we chose\n\n1:27:55.680 --> 1:27:58.640\n that are noninvasive fall short for a variety of reasons.\n\n1:27:58.640 --> 1:28:00.600\n It's just, it's unknown.\n\n1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:03.200\n And so right now the two technologies we chose,\n\n1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:06.320\n the analogy I'd give you to create a baseline\n\n1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:09.000\n of understanding is if you think of it\n\n1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:11.320\n like the internet in the nineties,\n\n1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:12.960\n the internet became useful\n\n1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:15.740\n when people could do a dial up connection.\n\n1:28:15.740 --> 1:28:19.320\n And then as bandwidth increased,\n\n1:28:19.320 --> 1:28:21.080\n so did the utility of that connection\n\n1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:22.880\n and so did the ecosystem improve.\n\n1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:26.200\n And so if you say what kernel flow\n\n1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:28.920\n is going to give you a full screen\n\n1:28:28.920 --> 1:28:30.720\n on the picture of information,\n\n1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:32.520\n but as you're gonna be watching a movie,\n\n1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:34.620\n but the image is going to be blurred\n\n1:28:34.620 --> 1:28:36.320\n and the audio is gonna be muffled.\n\n1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:40.560\n So it has a lower resolution of coverage.\n\n1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:43.480\n A kernel flux, our MEG technology\n\n1:28:43.480 --> 1:28:46.140\n is gonna give you the full movie and 1080p.\n\n1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:51.560\n And Neuralink is gonna give you a circle\n\n1:28:51.560 --> 1:28:53.600\n on the screen of 4K.\n\n1:28:55.320 --> 1:28:57.760\n And so each one has their pros and cons\n\n1:28:57.760 --> 1:28:59.920\n and it's give and take.\n\n1:28:59.920 --> 1:29:03.300\n And so the decision I made with kernel\n\n1:29:03.300 --> 1:29:06.280\n was that these two technologies, flux and flow\n\n1:29:06.280 --> 1:29:10.560\n were basically the answer for the next seven years.\n\n1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:12.640\n And that they would give rise to the ecosystem\n\n1:29:12.640 --> 1:29:14.000\n which would become much more valuable\n\n1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:15.400\n than the hardware itself.\n\n1:29:15.400 --> 1:29:16.620\n And that we would just continue to improve\n\n1:29:16.620 --> 1:29:18.480\n on the hardware over time.\n\n1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:20.880\n And you know, it's early days, so.\n\n1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:23.520\n It's kind of fascinating to think about that.\n\n1:29:23.520 --> 1:29:27.120\n You don't, it's very true that you don't know\n\n1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:30.880\n both paths are very promising.\n\n1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:35.880\n And it's like 50 years from now we will look back\n\n1:29:37.640 --> 1:29:39.680\n and maybe not even remember one of them.\n\n1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:43.120\n And the other one might change the world.\n\n1:29:43.120 --> 1:29:44.840\n It's so cool how technology is.\n\n1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:47.000\n I mean, that's what entrepreneurship is,\n\n1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:50.040\n is like, it's the zero principle.\n\n1:29:50.040 --> 1:29:52.360\n It's like you're marching ahead into the darkness,\n\n1:29:52.360 --> 1:29:54.720\n into the fog, not knowing.\n\n1:29:54.720 --> 1:29:56.320\n It's wonderful to have someone else\n\n1:29:56.320 --> 1:29:57.920\n out there with us doing this.\n\n1:29:57.920 --> 1:30:02.080\n Because if you look at brain interfaces, anything\n\n1:30:02.080 --> 1:30:07.080\n that's off the shelf right now is inadequate.\n\n1:30:07.160 --> 1:30:09.560\n It's had its run for a couple of decades.\n\n1:30:09.560 --> 1:30:11.240\n It's still in hacker communities.\n\n1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:12.880\n It hasn't gone to the mainstream.\n\n1:30:14.560 --> 1:30:17.820\n The room size machines are on their own path.\n\n1:30:19.040 --> 1:30:20.560\n But there is no answer right now\n\n1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:23.600\n of bringing brain interfaces mainstream.\n\n1:30:23.600 --> 1:30:27.000\n And so it both, you know, both they and us,\n\n1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:29.560\n we've both spent over a hundred million dollars.\n\n1:30:29.560 --> 1:30:32.720\n And that's kind of what it takes to have a go at this.\n\n1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:34.880\n Cause you need to build full stack.\n\n1:30:34.880 --> 1:30:37.480\n I mean, at Kernel, we are from the photon\n\n1:30:37.480 --> 1:30:40.000\n and the atom through the machine learning.\n\n1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:41.520\n We have just under a hundred people.\n\n1:30:41.520 --> 1:30:45.080\n I think it's something like 36, 37 PhDs\n\n1:30:45.080 --> 1:30:47.440\n in these specialties, in these areas\n\n1:30:47.440 --> 1:30:48.640\n that there's only a few people in the world\n\n1:30:48.640 --> 1:30:50.160\n who have these abilities.\n\n1:30:50.160 --> 1:30:53.160\n And that's what it takes to build next generation,\n\n1:30:53.160 --> 1:30:57.520\n to make an attempt at breaking into brain interfaces.\n\n1:30:57.520 --> 1:30:58.920\n And so we'll see over the next couple of years,\n\n1:30:58.920 --> 1:31:00.040\n whether it's the right time\n\n1:31:00.040 --> 1:31:01.640\n or whether we were both too early\n\n1:31:01.640 --> 1:31:04.400\n or whether something else comes along in seven to 10 years,\n\n1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:08.000\n which is the right thing that brings it mainstream.\n\n1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:11.040\n So you see Elon as a kind of competitor\n\n1:31:11.040 --> 1:31:16.040\n or a fellow traveler along the path of uncertainty or both?\n\n1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:19.000\n It's a fellow traveler.\n\n1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:21.800\n It's like at the beginning of the internet\n\n1:31:21.800 --> 1:31:25.480\n is how many companies are going to be invited\n\n1:31:25.480 --> 1:31:27.520\n to this new ecosystem?\n\n1:31:29.480 --> 1:31:30.520\n Like an endless number.\n\n1:31:30.520 --> 1:31:33.200\n Because if you think that the hardware\n\n1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:36.040\n just starts the process.\n\n1:31:36.040 --> 1:31:37.960\n And so, okay, back to your initial example,\n\n1:31:37.960 --> 1:31:39.360\n if you take the Fitbit, for example,\n\n1:31:39.360 --> 1:31:42.840\n you say, okay, now I can get measurements on the body.\n\n1:31:42.840 --> 1:31:44.840\n And what do we think the ultimate value\n\n1:31:44.840 --> 1:31:45.800\n of this device is going to be?\n\n1:31:45.800 --> 1:31:47.760\n What is the information transfer rate?\n\n1:31:47.760 --> 1:31:50.120\n And they were in the market for a certain duration of time\n\n1:31:50.120 --> 1:31:52.960\n and Google bought them for two and a half billion dollars.\n\n1:31:53.840 --> 1:31:55.600\n They didn't have ancillary value add.\n\n1:31:55.600 --> 1:31:58.560\n There weren't people building on top of the Fitbit device.\n\n1:31:58.560 --> 1:32:01.240\n They also didn't have increased insight\n\n1:32:01.240 --> 1:32:02.400\n with additional data streams.\n\n1:32:02.400 --> 1:32:04.240\n So it was really just the device.\n\n1:32:04.240 --> 1:32:07.120\n If you look, for example, at Apple and the device they sell,\n\n1:32:07.120 --> 1:32:09.160\n you have value in the device that someone buys,\n\n1:32:09.160 --> 1:32:11.760\n but also you have everyone who's building on top of it.\n\n1:32:11.760 --> 1:32:13.440\n So you have this additional ecosystem value\n\n1:32:13.440 --> 1:32:15.640\n and then you have additional data streams that come in\n\n1:32:15.640 --> 1:32:17.480\n which increase the value of the product.\n\n1:32:17.480 --> 1:32:20.600\n And so if you say, if you look at the hardware\n\n1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:24.440\n as the instigator of value creation,\n\n1:32:24.440 --> 1:32:28.200\n over time what we've built may constitute five or 10%\n\n1:32:28.200 --> 1:32:29.800\n of the value of the overall ecosystem.\n\n1:32:29.800 --> 1:32:30.960\n And that's what we really care about.\n\n1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:33.280\n What we're trying to do is kickstart\n\n1:32:33.280 --> 1:32:38.280\n the mainstream adoption of quantifying the brain.\n\n1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:41.840\n And the hardware just opens the door to say\n\n1:32:41.840 --> 1:32:44.040\n what kind of ecosystem could exist.\n\n1:32:44.040 --> 1:32:46.800\n And that's why the examples are so relevant\n\n1:32:46.800 --> 1:32:49.240\n of the things you've outlined in your life.\n\n1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:52.680\n I hope those things, the books people write,\n\n1:32:52.680 --> 1:32:55.480\n the experiences people build, the conversations you have,\n\n1:32:55.480 --> 1:32:58.040\n your relationship with your AI systems,\n\n1:32:58.040 --> 1:33:01.160\n I hope those all are feeding on the insights\n\n1:33:01.160 --> 1:33:04.200\n built upon this ecosystem we've created to better your life.\n\n1:33:04.200 --> 1:33:06.200\n And so that's the thinking behind it.\n\n1:33:06.200 --> 1:33:07.560\n Again, with the Drake equation\n\n1:33:07.560 --> 1:33:10.920\n being the underlying driver of value.\n\n1:33:10.920 --> 1:33:13.520\n And the people at Kernel have joined\n\n1:33:13.520 --> 1:33:17.920\n not because we have certainty of success,\n\n1:33:17.920 --> 1:33:21.080\n but because we find it to be the most exhilarating\n\n1:33:21.080 --> 1:33:25.080\n opportunity we could ever pursue in this time to be alive.\n\n1:33:26.320 --> 1:33:30.840\n You founded the payment system Braintree in 2007\n\n1:33:30.840 --> 1:33:34.240\n that acquired Venmo in 2012,\n\n1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:39.240\n in that same year was acquired by PayPal, which is now eBay.\n\n1:33:39.240 --> 1:33:42.240\n Can you tell me the story of the vision\n\n1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:44.800\n and the challenge of building an online payment system\n\n1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:48.080\n and just building a large successful business in general?\n\n1:33:48.080 --> 1:33:51.000\n I discovered payments by accident.\n\n1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:56.000\n When I was 21, I just returned from Ecuador\n\n1:33:57.800 --> 1:33:59.320\n living among extreme poverty for two years.\n\n1:33:59.320 --> 1:34:03.320\n And I came back to the US and I was shocked by the opulence\n\n1:34:03.320 --> 1:34:07.320\n of the United States of America.\n\n1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:09.440\n Yeah, of the United States.\n\n1:34:09.440 --> 1:34:12.000\n And I just thought this is, I couldn't believe it.\n\n1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:16.680\n And I decided I wanted to try to spend my life helping others.\n\n1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:18.600\n Like that was the, that was a life objective\n\n1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:20.320\n that I thought was worthwhile to pursue\n\n1:34:20.320 --> 1:34:23.040\n versus making money and whatever the case may be\n\n1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:24.480\n for its own right.\n\n1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:26.520\n And so I decided in that moment that I was going to\n\n1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:30.040\n try to make enough money by the age of 30\n\n1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:32.160\n to never have to work again.\n\n1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:33.920\n And then with some abundance of money,\n\n1:34:33.920 --> 1:34:38.440\n I could then choose to do things that might be beneficial\n\n1:34:38.440 --> 1:34:40.320\n to others, but may not meet the criteria\n\n1:34:40.320 --> 1:34:42.400\n of being a standalone business.\n\n1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:46.160\n And so in that process, I started a few companies,\n\n1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:49.760\n had some small successes, had some failures.\n\n1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:53.000\n In one of the endeavors, I was up to my eyeballs in debt.\n\n1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:54.040\n Things were not going well.\n\n1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:57.840\n And I needed a part time job to pay my bills.\n\n1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:02.840\n And so I, one day I saw in the paper in Utah\n\n1:35:02.840 --> 1:35:05.400\n where I was living the 50 richest people in Utah.\n\n1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:07.920\n And I emailed each one of their assistants and said,\n\n1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:11.440\n you know, I'm young, I'm resourceful, I'll do anything.\n\n1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:13.640\n I'll just want to, I'm entrepreneurial.\n\n1:35:13.640 --> 1:35:15.520\n I tried to get a job that would be flexible\n\n1:35:15.520 --> 1:35:17.400\n and no one responded.\n\n1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:21.280\n And then I interviewed at a few dozen places.\n\n1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:23.280\n Nobody would even give me the time of day.\n\n1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:25.360\n Like it wouldn't want to take me seriously.\n\n1:35:25.360 --> 1:35:27.680\n And so finally I, it was on monster.com\n\n1:35:27.680 --> 1:35:30.920\n that I saw this job posting for credit card sales\n\n1:35:30.920 --> 1:35:31.760\n door to door.\n\n1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:32.600\n Commission.\n\n1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:35.360\n I did not know the story, this is great.\n\n1:35:35.360 --> 1:35:37.400\n I love the head drop, that's exactly right.\n\n1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:38.240\n So it was.\n\n1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:41.720\n The low points to which we go in life.\n\n1:35:41.720 --> 1:35:46.080\n So I responded and you know, the person made an attempt\n\n1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:48.640\n at suggesting that they had some kind of standards\n\n1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:50.360\n that they would consider hiring.\n\n1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:53.160\n But it's kind of like, if you could fog a mirror,\n\n1:35:53.160 --> 1:35:55.680\n like come and do this because it's 100% commission.\n\n1:35:55.680 --> 1:35:57.520\n And so I started walking up and down the street\n\n1:35:57.520 --> 1:36:00.520\n in my community selling credit card processing.\n\n1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:03.480\n And so what you learn immediately in doing that is\n\n1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:06.640\n if you walk into a business, first of all,\n\n1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:08.600\n the business owner is typically there.\n\n1:36:09.600 --> 1:36:10.880\n And you walk in the door and they can tell\n\n1:36:10.880 --> 1:36:12.200\n by how you're dressed or how you walk,\n\n1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:14.440\n whatever their pattern recognition is.\n\n1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:15.680\n And they just hate you immediately.\n\n1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:17.040\n It's like, stop wasting my time.\n\n1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:18.400\n I really am trying to get stuff done.\n\n1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:19.760\n I don't want us to a sales pitch.\n\n1:36:19.760 --> 1:36:23.200\n And so you have to overcome the initial get out.\n\n1:36:23.200 --> 1:36:26.200\n And then once you engage, when you say the word\n\n1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:28.640\n credit card processing, the person's like,\n\n1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:31.200\n I already hate you because I have been taken advantage\n\n1:36:31.200 --> 1:36:35.520\n of dozens of times because you all are weasels.\n\n1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:37.480\n And so I had to figure out an algorithm\n\n1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:39.200\n to get past all those different conditions.\n\n1:36:39.200 --> 1:36:41.360\n Cause I was still working on my other startup\n\n1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:42.600\n for the majority of my time.\n\n1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:44.000\n So I was doing this part time.\n\n1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:48.760\n And so I figured out that the industry really was built\n\n1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:53.760\n on people, on deceit, basically people promising things\n\n1:36:55.320 --> 1:36:56.160\n that were not reality.\n\n1:36:56.160 --> 1:36:57.480\n And so I don't know if you've heard of it,\n\n1:36:57.480 --> 1:36:59.320\n but we're not reality and so I'd walk into a business.\n\n1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:01.760\n I'd say, look, I would give you a hundred dollars.\n\n1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:02.920\n I'd put a hundred dollar bill and say,\n\n1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:04.000\n I'll give you a hundred dollars\n\n1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:05.440\n for three minutes of your time.\n\n1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:06.760\n If you don't say yes to what I'm saying,\n\n1:37:06.760 --> 1:37:08.400\n I'll give you a hundred dollars.\n\n1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:10.680\n And then he usually crack a smile and say, okay,\n\n1:37:10.680 --> 1:37:12.640\n like what do you got for me son?\n\n1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:15.000\n And so I'd sit down, I just opened my book and I'd say,\n\n1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:16.280\n here's the credit card industry.\n\n1:37:16.280 --> 1:37:17.120\n Here's how it works.\n\n1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:17.960\n Here are the players.\n\n1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:18.780\n Here's what they do.\n\n1:37:18.780 --> 1:37:20.520\n Here's how they deceive you.\n\n1:37:20.520 --> 1:37:21.360\n Here's what I am.\n\n1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:22.480\n I'm no different than anyone else.\n\n1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:24.080\n I it's like, you're gonna process your credit card.\n\n1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:25.040\n You're gonna get the money in the account.\n\n1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:27.640\n You're just gonna get a clean statement, you're gonna have\n\n1:37:27.640 --> 1:37:29.600\n someone who answers the call when someone asks and you know,\n\n1:37:29.600 --> 1:37:31.720\n just like the basic, like you're okay.\n\n1:37:31.720 --> 1:37:32.800\n And people started saying yes.\n\n1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:34.440\n And then of course I went to the next business and be like,\n\n1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:37.520\n you know, Joe and Susie and whoever said yes too.\n\n1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:39.400\n And so I built a social proof structure\n\n1:37:39.400 --> 1:37:42.400\n and I became the number one salesperson\n\n1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:45.400\n out of 400 people nationwide doing this.\n\n1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:47.080\n And I worked, you know, half time\n\n1:37:47.080 --> 1:37:49.360\n still doing this other startup and.\n\n1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:51.080\n That's a brilliant strategy, by the way.\n\n1:37:51.080 --> 1:37:55.680\n It's very well, very well strategized and executed.\n\n1:37:55.680 --> 1:37:57.640\n I did it for nine months.\n\n1:37:57.640 --> 1:38:00.800\n And at the time my customer base was making,\n\n1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:03.680\n was generating around, I think it was six,\n\n1:38:03.680 --> 1:38:07.480\n if I remember correctly, $62,504 a month\n\n1:38:07.480 --> 1:38:08.520\n were the overall revenues.\n\n1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:09.920\n I thought, wow, that's amazing.\n\n1:38:09.920 --> 1:38:13.260\n If I built that as my own company,\n\n1:38:13.260 --> 1:38:16.880\n I would just make $62,000 a month of income passively\n\n1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:19.280\n with these merchants processing credit cards.\n\n1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:20.400\n So I thought, hmm.\n\n1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:23.720\n And so that's when I thought I'm gonna create a company.\n\n1:38:23.720 --> 1:38:25.840\n And so then I started Braintree.\n\n1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:29.920\n And the idea was the online world was broken\n\n1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:34.920\n because PayPal had been acquired by eBay\n\n1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:38.160\n around, I think, 1999 or 2000.\n\n1:38:38.160 --> 1:38:39.840\n And eBay had not innovated much with PayPal.\n\n1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:42.880\n So it basically sat still for seven years\n\n1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:45.160\n as the software world moved along.\n\n1:38:45.160 --> 1:38:46.840\n And then authorize.net was also a company\n\n1:38:46.840 --> 1:38:47.680\n that was relatively stagnant.\n\n1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:49.840\n So you basically had software engineers\n\n1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:51.880\n who wanted modern payment tools,\n\n1:38:51.880 --> 1:38:53.560\n but there were none available for them.\n\n1:38:53.560 --> 1:38:55.080\n And so they just dealt with software they didn't like.\n\n1:38:55.080 --> 1:38:57.320\n And so with Braintree,\n\n1:38:57.320 --> 1:38:59.000\n I thought the entry point is to build software\n\n1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:00.400\n that engineers will love.\n\n1:39:00.400 --> 1:39:02.120\n And if we can find the entry point via software\n\n1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:03.800\n and make it easy and beautiful\n\n1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:05.400\n and just a magical experience\n\n1:39:05.400 --> 1:39:06.960\n and then provide customer service on top of that,\n\n1:39:06.960 --> 1:39:08.720\n that would be easy, that would be great.\n\n1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:11.560\n What I was really going after though, it was PayPal.\n\n1:39:11.560 --> 1:39:14.960\n They were the only company in payments making money.\n\n1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:19.800\n Because they had the relationship with eBay early on,\n\n1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:22.240\n people created a PayPal account,\n\n1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:24.080\n they'd fund their account with their checking account\n\n1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:25.480\n versus their credit cards.\n\n1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:28.320\n And then when they'd use PayPal to pay a merchant,\n\n1:39:28.320 --> 1:39:31.000\n PayPal had a cost of payment of zero\n\n1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.880\n versus if you have coming from a credit card,\n\n1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:35.120\n you have to pay the bank the fees.\n\n1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:39.920\n So PayPal's margins were 3% on a transaction\n\n1:39:39.920 --> 1:39:41.600\n versus a typical payments company,\n\n1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:43.400\n which may be a nickel or a penny or a dime\n\n1:39:43.400 --> 1:39:44.920\n or something like that.\n\n1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:48.320\n And so I knew PayPal really was the model to replicate,\n\n1:39:48.320 --> 1:39:50.400\n but a bunch of companies had tried to do that.\n\n1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:52.600\n They tried to come in and build a two sided marketplace.\n\n1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:55.280\n So get consumers to fund the checking account\n\n1:39:55.280 --> 1:39:56.680\n and the merchants to accept it,\n\n1:39:56.680 --> 1:39:58.240\n but they'd all failed because building\n\n1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:01.840\n a two sided marketplace is very hard at the same time.\n\n1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:04.600\n So my plan was I'm going to build a company\n\n1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:06.920\n and get the best merchants in the whole world\n\n1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:08.440\n to use our service.\n\n1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:10.760\n Then in year five, I'm going to have,\n\n1:40:10.760 --> 1:40:12.800\n I'm going to acquire a consumer payments company\n\n1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:14.960\n and I'm going to bring the two together.\n\n1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:19.160\n And to focus on the merchant side and then get\n\n1:40:19.160 --> 1:40:21.240\n the payments company that does the customer,\n\n1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:24.640\n the whatever, the other side of it.\n\n1:40:24.640 --> 1:40:26.680\n This is the plan I presented when I was\n\n1:40:26.680 --> 1:40:28.440\n at University of Chicago.\n\n1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:32.360\n And weirdly it happened exactly like that.\n\n1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:36.160\n So four years in our customer base included Uber,\n\n1:40:36.160 --> 1:40:40.240\n Airbnb, GitHub, 37 Signals, not Basecamp.\n\n1:40:40.240 --> 1:40:43.640\n We had a fantastic collection of companies\n\n1:40:43.640 --> 1:40:47.160\n that represented the fastest growing,\n\n1:40:47.160 --> 1:40:49.280\n some of the fastest growing tech companies in the world.\n\n1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:53.440\n And then we met up with Venmo and they had done\n\n1:40:53.440 --> 1:40:55.040\n a remarkable job in building product.\n\n1:40:55.040 --> 1:40:56.800\n It does up then something very counterintuitive,\n\n1:40:56.800 --> 1:40:59.400\n which is make public your private financial transactions\n\n1:40:59.400 --> 1:41:01.760\n which people previously thought were something\n\n1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:03.960\n that should be hidden from others.\n\n1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:08.720\n And we acquired Venmo and at that point we now had,\n\n1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:11.840\n we replicated the model because now people could fund\n\n1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:13.240\n their Venmo account with their checking account,\n\n1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:14.960\n keep money in the account.\n\n1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:17.520\n And then you could just plug Venmo as a form of payment.\n\n1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:19.880\n And so I think PayPal saw that,\n\n1:41:19.880 --> 1:41:22.720\n that we were getting the best merchants in the world.\n\n1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:25.440\n We had people using Venmo.\n\n1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:28.120\n They were both the up and coming millennials at the time\n\n1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:30.440\n who had so much influence online.\n\n1:41:30.440 --> 1:41:34.840\n And so they came in and offered us an attractive number.\n\n1:41:34.840 --> 1:41:39.240\n And my goal was not to build\n\n1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:40.920\n the biggest payments company in the world.\n\n1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:44.160\n It wasn't to try to climb the Forbes billionaire list.\n\n1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:47.880\n It was, the objective was I want to earn enough money\n\n1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:52.640\n so that I can basically dedicate my attention\n\n1:41:52.640 --> 1:41:56.200\n to doing something that could potentially be useful\n\n1:41:56.200 --> 1:41:58.800\n on a society wide scale.\n\n1:41:58.800 --> 1:42:03.240\n And more importantly, that could be considered to be valuable\n\n1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:08.240\n from the vantage point of 2050, 2100 and 2500.\n\n1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:12.360\n So thinking about it on a few hundred year timescale.\n\n1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:16.240\n And there was a certain amount of money I needed to do that.\n\n1:42:16.240 --> 1:42:20.280\n So I didn't require the permission of anybody to do that.\n\n1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:22.760\n And so that what PayPal offered was sufficient for me\n\n1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:25.000\n to get that amount of money to basically have a go.\n\n1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:30.000\n And that's when I set off to survey everything\n\n1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:32.600\n I could identify an existence to say\n\n1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:35.320\n of anything in the entire world I could do.\n\n1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:36.760\n What one thing could I do\n\n1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:40.480\n that would actually have the highest value potential\n\n1:42:40.480 --> 1:42:42.160\n for the species?\n\n1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:44.680\n And so it took me a little while to arrive at Brainerd Faces,\n\n1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:45.520\n but.\n\n1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:51.680\n Payments in themselves are revolutionary technologies\n\n1:42:51.960 --> 1:42:53.960\n that can change the world.\n\n1:42:53.960 --> 1:42:58.960\n Like let's not forget that too easily.\n\n1:43:00.760 --> 1:43:02.480\n I mean, obviously you know this,\n\n1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:07.480\n but there's quite a few lovely folks\n\n1:43:08.680 --> 1:43:13.080\n who are now fascinated with the space of cryptocurrency.\n\n1:43:13.080 --> 1:43:17.000\n And payments are very much connected to this,\n\n1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:18.600\n but in general, just money.\n\n1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:21.240\n And many of the folks I've spoken with,\n\n1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:22.840\n they also kind of connect that\n\n1:43:22.840 --> 1:43:25.840\n to not just purely financial discussions,\n\n1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:28.600\n but philosophical and political discussions.\n\n1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:33.600\n And they see Bitcoin as a way, almost as activism,\n\n1:43:34.680 --> 1:43:38.000\n almost as a way to resist the corruption\n\n1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:40.720\n of centralized centers of power.\n\n1:43:40.720 --> 1:43:42.760\n And sort of basically in the 21st century,\n\n1:43:42.760 --> 1:43:44.440\n decentralizing control.\n\n1:43:44.440 --> 1:43:46.640\n Whether that's Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,\n\n1:43:46.640 --> 1:43:51.640\n they see that's one possible way to give power\n\n1:43:51.800 --> 1:43:55.480\n to those that live in regimes that are corrupt\n\n1:43:55.480 --> 1:43:58.240\n or are not respectful of human rights\n\n1:43:58.240 --> 1:43:59.760\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:43:59.760 --> 1:44:03.960\n What's your sense, just all your expertise with payments\n\n1:44:03.960 --> 1:44:05.600\n and seeing how that changed the world,\n\n1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:09.680\n what's your sense about the lay of the land\n\n1:44:09.680 --> 1:44:12.440\n for the future of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies\n\n1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:16.000\n in the positive impact it may have on the world?\n\n1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:20.120\n To be clear, my communication wasn't meant\n\n1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:23.520\n to minimize payments or to denigrate it in any way.\n\n1:44:23.520 --> 1:44:26.480\n It was an attempt at communication\n\n1:44:26.480 --> 1:44:29.400\n that when I was surveying the world,\n\n1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:35.280\n it was an algorithm of what could I individually do?\n\n1:44:35.840 --> 1:44:38.320\n So there are things that exist\n\n1:44:38.320 --> 1:44:41.120\n that have a lot of potential that can be done.\n\n1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:43.960\n And then there's a filtering of how many people\n\n1:44:43.960 --> 1:44:46.440\n are qualified to do this given thing.\n\n1:44:46.440 --> 1:44:48.200\n And then there's a further characterization\n\n1:44:48.200 --> 1:44:49.840\n that can be done of, okay, given the number\n\n1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:54.840\n of qualified people, will somebody be a unique out performer\n\n1:44:54.840 --> 1:44:57.960\n of that group to make something truly impossible\n\n1:44:57.960 --> 1:44:59.520\n to be something done that otherwise couldn't get done?\n\n1:44:59.520 --> 1:45:02.480\n So there's a process of assessing\n\n1:45:02.480 --> 1:45:04.480\n where can you add unique value in the world?\n\n1:45:04.480 --> 1:45:08.560\n And some of that has to do with you being very formal\n\n1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:11.080\n and calculative here, but some of that is just like,\n\n1:45:11.080 --> 1:45:15.040\n what do you sense, like part of that equation\n\n1:45:15.040 --> 1:45:17.240\n is how much passion you sense within yourself\n\n1:45:17.240 --> 1:45:19.080\n to be able to drive that through,\n\n1:45:19.080 --> 1:45:21.520\n to discover the impossibilities and make them possible.\n\n1:45:21.520 --> 1:45:23.920\n That's right, and so we were at Braintree,\n\n1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:26.880\n I think we were the first company to integrate Coinbase\n\n1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:30.080\n into our, I think we were the first payments company\n\n1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:35.080\n to formally incorporate crypto, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:36.720\n For people who are not familiar,\n\n1:45:36.720 --> 1:45:39.640\n Coinbase is a place where you can trade cryptocurrencies.\n\n1:45:39.640 --> 1:45:42.080\n Yeah, which was one of the only places you could.\n\n1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:45.080\n So we were early in doing that.\n\n1:45:45.080 --> 1:45:49.080\n And of course, this was in the year 2013.\n\n1:45:49.080 --> 1:45:52.400\n So an attorney to go in cryptocurrency land.\n\n1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:56.320\n I concur with the statement you made\n\n1:45:56.320 --> 1:46:01.320\n of the potential of the principles\n\n1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:03.120\n underlying cryptocurrencies.\n\n1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:07.640\n And that many of the things that they're building\n\n1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:12.640\n in the name of money and of moving value\n\n1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:16.400\n is equally applicable to the brain\n\n1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:19.360\n and equally applicable to how the brain interacts\n\n1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:20.840\n with the rest of the world\n\n1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:25.600\n and how we would imagine doing goal alignment with people.\n\n1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:29.080\n So to me, it's a continuous spectrum of possibility.\n\n1:46:29.080 --> 1:46:32.200\n And your question is isolated on the money.\n\n1:46:32.200 --> 1:46:35.000\n And I think it just is basically a scaffolding layer\n\n1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:35.840\n for all of society.\n\n1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:38.720\n So you don't see this money as particularly distinct\n\n1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:39.760\n from other? I don't.\n\n1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:44.520\n I think we at Kernel, we will benefit greatly\n\n1:46:44.520 --> 1:46:47.080\n from the progress being made in cryptocurrency\n\n1:46:47.080 --> 1:46:48.960\n because it will be a similar technology stack\n\n1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:51.680\n we will want to use for many things we want to accomplish.\n\n1:46:51.680 --> 1:46:55.040\n And so I'm bullish on what's going on\n\n1:46:55.040 --> 1:46:58.800\n and think it could greatly enhance brain interfaces\n\n1:46:58.800 --> 1:47:01.160\n and the value of the brain interface ecosystem.\n\n1:47:01.160 --> 1:47:02.920\n I mean, is there something you could say about,\n\n1:47:02.920 --> 1:47:05.960\n first of all, bullish on cryptocurrency versus fiat money?\n\n1:47:05.960 --> 1:47:08.760\n So do you have a sense that in 21st century\n\n1:47:08.760 --> 1:47:13.040\n cryptocurrency will be embraced by governments\n\n1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:16.720\n and changed the face of governments,\n\n1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:18.520\n the structure of governments?\n\n1:47:18.520 --> 1:47:23.520\n It's the same way I think about my diet,\n\n1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:27.160\n where previously it was conscious Brian,\n\n1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:32.240\n looking at foods in certain biochemical states.\n\n1:47:32.240 --> 1:47:34.160\n Am I hungry? Am I irritated? Am I depressed?\n\n1:47:34.160 --> 1:47:37.440\n And then I choose based upon those momentary windows.\n\n1:47:37.440 --> 1:47:39.440\n Do I eat at night when I'm fatigued\n\n1:47:39.440 --> 1:47:40.680\n and I have low willpower?\n\n1:47:40.680 --> 1:47:42.840\n Am I going to pig out on something?\n\n1:47:42.840 --> 1:47:46.200\n And the current monetary system is based\n\n1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:48.360\n upon human conscious decision making.\n\n1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:51.480\n And politics and power and this whole mess of things.\n\n1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:55.360\n And what I like about the building blocks\n\n1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:58.640\n of cryptocurrencies, it's methodical, it's structured,\n\n1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:02.120\n it is accountable, it's transparent.\n\n1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:04.720\n And so it introduces this scaffolding,\n\n1:48:04.720 --> 1:48:07.640\n which I think, again, is the right starting point\n\n1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:09.400\n for how we think about building\n\n1:48:09.400 --> 1:48:13.520\n next generation institutions for society.\n\n1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:16.480\n And that's why I think it's much broader than money.\n\n1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:19.680\n So I guess what you're saying is Bitcoin is the demotion\n\n1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:21.300\n of the conscious mind as well.\n\n1:48:23.480 --> 1:48:25.240\n In the same way you were talking about diet,\n\n1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:29.680\n it's like giving less priority to the ups and downs\n\n1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:33.000\n of any one particular human mind, in this case your own,\n\n1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:37.000\n and giving more power to the sort of data driven.\n\n1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.200\n Yes, yeah, I think that is accurate,\n\n1:48:41.200 --> 1:48:46.200\n that cryptocurrency is a version of what I would call\n\n1:48:48.480 --> 1:48:51.320\n my autonomous self that I'm trying to build.\n\n1:48:51.320 --> 1:48:54.960\n It is an introduction of an autonomous system\n\n1:48:54.960 --> 1:48:59.960\n of value exchange and the process of value creation\n\n1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:04.880\n in the society, yes, I see their similarities.\n\n1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:06.520\n So I guess what you're saying is Bitcoin\n\n1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:08.680\n will somehow help me not pig out at night,\n\n1:49:08.680 --> 1:49:11.800\n or the equivalent of, speaking of diet,\n\n1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:15.440\n if we could just linger on that topic a little bit,\n\n1:49:15.440 --> 1:49:20.080\n we already talked about your blog post of I fired myself,\n\n1:49:20.080 --> 1:49:23.560\n I fired Brian, the evening Brian,\n\n1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:28.560\n who's too willing to, not making good decisions\n\n1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:32.220\n for the long term well being and happiness\n\n1:49:32.220 --> 1:49:34.840\n of the entirety of the organism.\n\n1:49:34.840 --> 1:49:36.720\n Basically you were like pigging out at night.\n\n1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:41.120\n But it's interesting, because I do the same,\n\n1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:43.440\n in fact I often eat one meal a day,\n\n1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:49.440\n and like I have been this week actually,\n\n1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:54.320\n especially when I travel, and it's funny\n\n1:49:54.320 --> 1:49:59.320\n that it never occurred to me to just basically look\n\n1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:02.360\n at the fact that I'm able to be much smarter\n\n1:50:02.360 --> 1:50:04.240\n about my eating decisions in the morning\n\n1:50:04.240 --> 1:50:06.720\n and the afternoon than I am at night.\n\n1:50:06.720 --> 1:50:09.080\n So if I eat one meal a day, why not eat\n\n1:50:09.080 --> 1:50:11.360\n that one meal a day in the morning?\n\n1:50:12.680 --> 1:50:16.040\n Like I'm not, it never occurred to me,\n\n1:50:16.040 --> 1:50:21.040\n this revolutionary act, until you've outlined that.\n\n1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:23.220\n So maybe, can you give some details,\n\n1:50:23.220 --> 1:50:26.360\n and this is just you, this is one person,\n\n1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:29.800\n Brian, arrives at a particular thing that they do,\n\n1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:32.560\n but it's fascinating to kind of look\n\n1:50:32.560 --> 1:50:34.080\n at this one particular case study,\n\n1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:36.340\n so what works for you, diet wise?\n\n1:50:36.340 --> 1:50:38.760\n What's your actual diet, what do you eat,\n\n1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:40.200\n how often do you eat?\n\n1:50:40.200 --> 1:50:44.220\n My current protocol is basically the result\n\n1:50:44.220 --> 1:50:48.800\n of thousands of experiments and decision making.\n\n1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:51.880\n So I do this every 90 days, I do the tests,\n\n1:50:51.880 --> 1:50:54.720\n I do the cycle throughs, then I measure again,\n\n1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:56.280\n and then I'm measuring all the time.\n\n1:50:56.280 --> 1:50:59.440\n And so what I, of course I'm optimizing\n\n1:50:59.440 --> 1:51:01.800\n for my biomarkers, I want perfect cholesterol\n\n1:51:01.800 --> 1:51:03.720\n and I want perfect blood glucose levels\n\n1:51:03.720 --> 1:51:07.880\n and perfect DNA methylation processes.\n\n1:51:10.440 --> 1:51:12.480\n I also want perfect sleep.\n\n1:51:12.480 --> 1:51:14.960\n And so for example, recently, the past two weeks,\n\n1:51:14.960 --> 1:51:19.960\n my resting heart rate has been at 42 when I sleep.\n\n1:51:20.160 --> 1:51:22.120\n And when my resting heart rate's at 42,\n\n1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:24.120\n my HRV is at its highest.\n\n1:51:24.120 --> 1:51:29.120\n And I wake up in the morning feeling more energized\n\n1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:30.420\n than any other configuration.\n\n1:51:30.420 --> 1:51:32.400\n And so I know from all these processes\n\n1:51:32.400 --> 1:51:34.720\n that eating at roughly 8.30 in the morning,\n\n1:51:34.720 --> 1:51:37.640\n right after I work out on an empty stomach,\n\n1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:41.460\n creates enough distance between that completed eating\n\n1:51:41.460 --> 1:51:45.520\n and bedtime where I have almost no digestion processes\n\n1:51:45.520 --> 1:51:47.360\n going on in my body,\n\n1:51:47.360 --> 1:51:49.800\n therefore my resting heart rate goes very low.\n\n1:51:49.800 --> 1:51:51.380\n And when my resting heart rate's very low,\n\n1:51:51.380 --> 1:51:52.440\n I sleep with high quality.\n\n1:51:52.440 --> 1:51:54.360\n And so basically I've been trying to optimize\n\n1:51:54.360 --> 1:51:58.280\n the entirety of what I eat to my sleep quality.\n\n1:51:58.280 --> 1:52:00.480\n And my sleep quality then of course feeds into my willpower\n\n1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:02.600\n so it creates this virtuous cycle.\n\n1:52:02.600 --> 1:52:06.440\n And so at 8.30 what I do is I eat what I call super veggie,\n\n1:52:06.440 --> 1:52:10.280\n which is, it's a pudding of 250 grams of broccoli,\n\n1:52:10.280 --> 1:52:11.600\n 150 grams of cauliflower,\n\n1:52:11.600 --> 1:52:13.360\n and a whole bunch of other vegetables\n\n1:52:13.360 --> 1:52:16.080\n that I eat what I call nutty pudding, which is.\n\n1:52:16.080 --> 1:52:17.040\n You make the pudding yourself?\n\n1:52:17.040 --> 1:52:20.320\n Like, what do you call it?\n\n1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:23.520\n Like a veggie mix, whatever thing, like a blender?\n\n1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:25.680\n Yeah, you can be made in a high speed blender.\n\n1:52:25.680 --> 1:52:27.800\n But basically I eat the same thing every day,\n\n1:52:27.800 --> 1:52:30.920\n veggie bowl as in the form of pudding,\n\n1:52:30.920 --> 1:52:34.400\n and then a bowl in the form of nuts.\n\n1:52:34.400 --> 1:52:35.480\n And then I have.\n\n1:52:35.480 --> 1:52:36.320\n Vegan.\n\n1:52:36.320 --> 1:52:37.140\n Vegan, yes.\n\n1:52:37.140 --> 1:52:39.680\n Vegan, so that's fat and that's like,\n\n1:52:40.640 --> 1:52:43.600\n that's fat and carbs and that's the protein and so on.\n\n1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:44.440\n Then I have a third dish.\n\n1:52:44.440 --> 1:52:45.280\n Does it taste good?\n\n1:52:45.280 --> 1:52:46.200\n I love it.\n\n1:52:46.200 --> 1:52:49.480\n I love it so much I dream about it.\n\n1:52:49.480 --> 1:52:50.880\n Yeah, that's awesome.\n\n1:52:50.880 --> 1:52:52.200\n This is a.\n\n1:52:52.200 --> 1:52:53.760\n And then I have a third dish which is,\n\n1:52:53.760 --> 1:52:55.280\n it changes every day.\n\n1:52:55.280 --> 1:52:58.200\n Today it was kale and spinach and sweet potato.\n\n1:52:58.200 --> 1:53:02.160\n And then I take about 20 supplements\n\n1:53:03.040 --> 1:53:03.880\n that\n\n1:53:05.600 --> 1:53:09.120\n hopefully make, constitute a perfect nutritional profile.\n\n1:53:09.120 --> 1:53:12.040\n So what I'm trying to do is create the perfect diet\n\n1:53:12.040 --> 1:53:14.200\n for my body every single day.\n\n1:53:14.200 --> 1:53:16.360\n Where sleep is part of the optimization.\n\n1:53:16.360 --> 1:53:17.200\n That's right.\n\n1:53:17.200 --> 1:53:18.400\n You're like, one of the things you're really tracking.\n\n1:53:18.400 --> 1:53:21.060\n I mean, can you, well, I have a million question,\n\n1:53:21.060 --> 1:53:23.680\n but 20 supplements, like what kind are like,\n\n1:53:23.680 --> 1:53:25.160\n would you say are essential?\n\n1:53:25.160 --> 1:53:30.160\n Cause I only take, I only take athletic greens.com slash.\n\n1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:33.120\n That's like the multivitamin essentially.\n\n1:53:33.120 --> 1:53:35.720\n That's like the lazy man, you know, like,\n\n1:53:35.720 --> 1:53:37.640\n like if you don't actually want to think about shit,\n\n1:53:37.640 --> 1:53:40.480\n that's what you take and then fish oil and that's it.\n\n1:53:40.480 --> 1:53:41.620\n That's all I take.\n\n1:53:41.620 --> 1:53:45.080\n Yeah, you know, Alfred North Whitehead said,\n\n1:53:45.080 --> 1:53:48.760\n civilization advances as it extends the number\n\n1:53:48.760 --> 1:53:50.540\n of important operations it can do\n\n1:53:50.540 --> 1:53:52.540\n without thinking about them.\n\n1:53:52.540 --> 1:53:53.380\n Yes.\n\n1:53:53.380 --> 1:53:57.360\n So my objective on this is I want an algorithm\n\n1:53:57.360 --> 1:54:00.920\n for perfect health that I never have to think about.\n\n1:54:00.920 --> 1:54:03.840\n And then I want that system to be scalable to anybody\n\n1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:05.480\n so that they don't have to think about it.\n\n1:54:05.480 --> 1:54:07.720\n And right now it's expensive for me to do it.\n\n1:54:07.720 --> 1:54:09.060\n It's time consuming for me to do it.\n\n1:54:09.060 --> 1:54:10.400\n And I have infrastructure to do it,\n\n1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:14.800\n but the future of being human is not going\n\n1:54:14.800 --> 1:54:17.520\n to the grocery store and deciding what to eat.\n\n1:54:17.520 --> 1:54:19.560\n It's also not reading scientific papers,\n\n1:54:19.560 --> 1:54:21.360\n trying to decide this thing or that thing.\n\n1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:23.000\n It's all N of one.\n\n1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:26.040\n So it's devices on the outside and inside your body,\n\n1:54:26.040 --> 1:54:28.280\n assessing real time what your body needs\n\n1:54:28.280 --> 1:54:30.760\n and then creating closed loop systems for that to happen.\n\n1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:33.760\n Yeah, so right now you're doing the data collection\n\n1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:35.860\n and you're being the scientist,\n\n1:54:35.860 --> 1:54:39.060\n it'd be much better if you just did the data collect\n\n1:54:39.060 --> 1:54:40.820\n or it was being essentially done for you\n\n1:54:40.820 --> 1:54:43.760\n and you can outsource that to another scientist\n\n1:54:43.760 --> 1:54:46.040\n that's doing the N of one study of you.\n\n1:54:46.040 --> 1:54:48.540\n That's right, because every time I spend time thinking\n\n1:54:48.540 --> 1:54:50.400\n about this or executing, spending time on it,\n\n1:54:50.400 --> 1:54:53.680\n I'm spending less time thinking about building kernel\n\n1:54:53.680 --> 1:54:55.320\n or the future of being human.\n\n1:54:55.320 --> 1:54:58.000\n And so it's, we just all have the budget\n\n1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:01.320\n of our capacity on an everyday basis\n\n1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:05.580\n and we will scaffold our way up out of this.\n\n1:55:05.580 --> 1:55:07.800\n And so, yeah, hopefully what I'm doing is really,\n\n1:55:07.800 --> 1:55:11.480\n it serves as a model that others can also build on.\n\n1:55:11.480 --> 1:55:12.520\n That's why I wrote about it,\n\n1:55:12.520 --> 1:55:15.520\n is hopefully people can then take it and improve upon it.\n\n1:55:15.520 --> 1:55:16.500\n I hold nothing sacred.\n\n1:55:16.500 --> 1:55:19.680\n I change my diet almost every day\n\n1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:21.680\n based upon some new test results or science\n\n1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:23.000\n or something like that, but.\n\n1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:24.920\n Can you maybe elaborate on the sleep thing?\n\n1:55:24.920 --> 1:55:27.360\n Why is sleep so important?\n\n1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:32.360\n And why, presumably, like what does good sleep mean to you?\n\n1:55:34.680 --> 1:55:39.680\n I think sleep is a contender for being the most powerful\n\n1:55:43.900 --> 1:55:46.000\n health intervention in existence.\n\n1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:49.440\n It's a contender.\n\n1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:53.480\n I mean, it's magical what it does if you're well rested\n\n1:55:53.480 --> 1:55:56.760\n and what your body can do.\n\n1:55:56.760 --> 1:56:00.400\n And I mean, for example, I know when I eat close\n\n1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:05.400\n to my bedtime and I've done a systematic study for years\n\n1:56:05.480 --> 1:56:07.800\n looking at like 15 minute increments on time of day\n\n1:56:07.800 --> 1:56:09.760\n on where I eat my last meal,\n\n1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:12.600\n my willpower is directly correlated\n\n1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:14.520\n to the amount of deep sleep I get.\n\n1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:18.660\n So my ability to not binge eat at night\n\n1:56:18.660 --> 1:56:22.220\n when rascal Brian's out and about\n\n1:56:22.220 --> 1:56:24.460\n is based upon how much deep sleep I got the night before.\n\n1:56:24.460 --> 1:56:27.340\n Yeah, there's a lot to that, yeah.\n\n1:56:27.340 --> 1:56:30.300\n And so I've seen it manifest itself.\n\n1:56:30.300 --> 1:56:34.020\n And so I think the way I summarize this is\n\n1:56:34.020 --> 1:56:36.260\n in society we've had this myth of,\n\n1:56:36.260 --> 1:56:39.100\n we tell stories, for example, of entrepreneurship\n\n1:56:39.100 --> 1:56:41.580\n where this person was so amazing,\n\n1:56:41.580 --> 1:56:43.180\n they stayed at the office for three days\n\n1:56:43.180 --> 1:56:44.860\n and slept under their desk.\n\n1:56:44.860 --> 1:56:48.720\n And we say, wow, that's amazing, that's amazing.\n\n1:56:49.740 --> 1:56:52.620\n And now I think we're headed towards a state\n\n1:56:52.620 --> 1:56:54.920\n where we'd say that's primitive\n\n1:56:54.920 --> 1:56:58.680\n and really not a good idea on every level.\n\n1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:03.440\n And so the new mythology is going to be the exact opposite.\n\n1:57:05.020 --> 1:57:08.540\n Yeah, by the way, just to sort of maybe push back\n\n1:57:08.540 --> 1:57:10.180\n a little bit on that idea.\n\n1:57:10.180 --> 1:57:13.780\n Did you sleep under your desk collects?\n\n1:57:13.780 --> 1:57:14.620\n Well, yeah, a lot.\n\n1:57:14.620 --> 1:57:16.020\n I'm a big believer in that actually.\n\n1:57:16.020 --> 1:57:19.460\n I'm a big believer in chaos\n\n1:57:19.460 --> 1:57:22.420\n and giving into your passion\n\n1:57:22.420 --> 1:57:25.540\n and sometimes doing things that are out of the ordinary\n\n1:57:25.540 --> 1:57:29.300\n that are not trying to optimize health\n\n1:57:29.300 --> 1:57:34.300\n for certain periods of time in lieu of your passions\n\n1:57:35.740 --> 1:57:39.540\n is a signal to yourself that you're throwing everything away.\n\n1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:42.340\n So I think what you're referring to\n\n1:57:42.340 --> 1:57:46.180\n is how to have good performance for prolonged periods\n\n1:57:46.180 --> 1:57:47.580\n of time.\n\n1:57:47.580 --> 1:57:50.620\n I think there's moments in life\n\n1:57:50.620 --> 1:57:52.640\n where you need to throw all of that away,\n\n1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:54.920\n all the plans away, all the structure away.\n\n1:57:54.920 --> 1:57:59.920\n So I'm not sure I have an eloquent way\n\n1:58:00.680 --> 1:58:02.340\n describing exactly what I'm talking about,\n\n1:58:02.340 --> 1:58:07.340\n but it all depends on people, people are different,\n\n1:58:07.340 --> 1:58:10.220\n but there's a danger of over optimization\n\n1:58:11.380 --> 1:58:14.420\n to where you don't just give into the madness\n\n1:58:14.420 --> 1:58:17.940\n of the way your brain flows.\n\n1:58:17.940 --> 1:58:21.940\n I mean, to push back on my pushback is like,\n\n1:58:21.940 --> 1:58:26.940\n it's nice to have like where the foundations\n\n1:58:29.100 --> 1:58:31.660\n of your brain are not messed with.\n\n1:58:31.660 --> 1:58:35.340\n So you have a fixed foundation where the diet is fixed,\n\n1:58:35.340 --> 1:58:37.820\n where the sleep is fixed and that all of that is optimal\n\n1:58:37.820 --> 1:58:39.940\n and the chaos happens in the space of ideas\n\n1:58:39.940 --> 1:58:41.740\n as opposed to the space of biology.\n\n1:58:42.980 --> 1:58:46.220\n But I'm not sure if there's a,\n\n1:58:47.880 --> 1:58:50.900\n that requires real discipline and forming habits.\n\n1:58:50.900 --> 1:58:54.940\n There's some aspect to which some of the best days\n\n1:58:54.940 --> 1:58:56.460\n and weeks of my life have been, yeah,\n\n1:58:56.460 --> 1:58:58.520\n sleeping under a desk kind of thing.\n\n1:58:58.520 --> 1:59:03.520\n And I don't, I'm not too willing to let go\n\n1:59:03.520 --> 1:59:06.520\n of things that empirically worked\n\n1:59:08.040 --> 1:59:10.360\n for things that work in theory.\n\n1:59:11.460 --> 1:59:16.040\n And so I'm, again, I'm absolutely with you on sleep.\n\n1:59:16.040 --> 1:59:19.560\n Also, I'm with you on sleep conceptually,\n\n1:59:19.560 --> 1:59:23.900\n but I'm also very humbled to understand\n\n1:59:23.900 --> 1:59:26.760\n that for different people,\n\n1:59:26.760 --> 1:59:28.760\n good sleep means different things.\n\n1:59:28.760 --> 1:59:33.040\n I'm very hesitant to trust science on sleep.\n\n1:59:33.040 --> 1:59:35.760\n I think you should also be a scholar of your own body.\n\n1:59:35.760 --> 1:59:38.200\n Again, the experiment of NF1.\n\n1:59:38.200 --> 1:59:43.200\n I'm not so sure that a full night's sleep is great for me.\n\n1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:46.480\n There is something about that power nap\n\n1:59:47.840 --> 1:59:50.160\n that I just have not fully studied yet,\n\n1:59:50.160 --> 1:59:52.560\n but that nap is something special.\n\n1:59:52.560 --> 1:59:54.880\n That I'm not sure I found the optimal thing.\n\n1:59:55.960 --> 1:59:57.600\n So like there's a lot to be explored\n\n1:59:57.600 --> 2:00:00.200\n to what is exactly optimal amount of sleep,\n\n2:00:00.200 --> 2:00:02.400\n optimal kind of sleep combined with diet\n\n2:00:02.400 --> 2:00:03.240\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n2:00:03.240 --> 2:00:05.560\n I mean, that all maps the sort of data,\n\n2:00:05.560 --> 2:00:08.840\n at least the truth, exactly what you're referring to.\n\n2:00:08.840 --> 2:00:10.520\n Here's a data point for your consideration.\n\n2:00:10.520 --> 2:00:11.360\n Yes.\n\n2:00:12.760 --> 2:00:17.400\n The progress in biology over the past, say decade,\n\n2:00:17.400 --> 2:00:18.800\n has been stunning.\n\n2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:19.640\n Yes.\n\n2:00:19.640 --> 2:00:24.240\n And it now appears as if we will be able to replace\n\n2:00:25.220 --> 2:00:28.300\n our organs, zero X for a transplantation.\n\n2:00:28.300 --> 2:00:33.300\n And so we probably have a path to replace\n\n2:00:33.880 --> 2:00:37.840\n and regenerate every organ of your body,\n\n2:00:37.840 --> 2:00:38.940\n except for your brain.\n\n2:00:42.480 --> 2:00:45.280\n You can lose your hand and your arm and a leg.\n\n2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:47.520\n You can have an artificial heart.\n\n2:00:47.520 --> 2:00:49.640\n You can't operate without your brain.\n\n2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:52.180\n And so when you make that trade off decision\n\n2:00:52.180 --> 2:00:54.760\n of whether you're going to sleep under the desk or not\n\n2:00:54.760 --> 2:00:59.760\n and go all out for a four day marathon, right?\n\n2:01:00.280 --> 2:01:02.760\n There's a cost benefit trade off of what's going on,\n\n2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:05.740\n what's happening to your brain in that situation.\n\n2:01:05.740 --> 2:01:07.600\n We don't know the consequences\n\n2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:09.940\n of modern day life on our brain.\n\n2:01:09.940 --> 2:01:14.940\n We don't, it's the most valuable organ in our existence.\n\n2:01:14.940 --> 2:01:18.200\n And we don't know what's going on if we,\n\n2:01:18.200 --> 2:01:20.660\n in how we're treating it today with stress\n\n2:01:20.660 --> 2:01:23.400\n and with sleep and with dietary.\n\n2:01:23.400 --> 2:01:28.400\n And to me, then if you say that you're trying to,\n\n2:01:28.520 --> 2:01:30.000\n you're trying to optimize life\n\n2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:31.960\n for whatever things you're trying to do.\n\n2:01:32.920 --> 2:01:36.380\n The game is soon with the progress in anti aging and biology,\n\n2:01:36.380 --> 2:01:38.160\n the game is very soon going to become different\n\n2:01:38.160 --> 2:01:41.240\n than what it is right now with organ rejuvenation,\n\n2:01:41.240 --> 2:01:42.660\n organ replacement.\n\n2:01:42.660 --> 2:01:47.660\n And I would conjecture that we will value\n\n2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:52.440\n the health status of our brain above all things.\n\n2:01:52.440 --> 2:01:53.960\n Yeah, no, absolutely.\n\n2:01:53.960 --> 2:01:58.200\n Everything you're saying is true, but we die.\n\n2:01:58.200 --> 2:02:01.160\n We die pretty quickly, life is short.\n\n2:02:01.160 --> 2:02:06.160\n And I'm one of those people that I would rather die in battle\n\n2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:11.160\n than stay safe at home.\n\n2:02:11.160 --> 2:02:14.860\n It's like, yeah, you look at kind of,\n\n2:02:14.860 --> 2:02:17.120\n there's a lot of things that you can reasonably say,\n\n2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:19.040\n these are, this is the smart thing to do\n\n2:02:19.040 --> 2:02:21.640\n that can prevent you, that becomes conservative,\n\n2:02:21.640 --> 2:02:24.440\n that can prevent you from fully embracing life.\n\n2:02:24.440 --> 2:02:27.560\n I think ultimately you can be very intelligent\n\n2:02:27.560 --> 2:02:30.760\n and data driven and also embrace life.\n\n2:02:30.760 --> 2:02:33.760\n But I err on the side of embracing life.\n\n2:02:33.760 --> 2:02:36.720\n It's very, it takes a very skillful person\n\n2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:40.280\n to not sort of that hovering parent that says,\n\n2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:44.600\n you know what, there's a 3% chance that if you go out,\n\n2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:47.700\n if you go out by yourself and play, you're going to die,\n\n2:02:47.700 --> 2:02:51.820\n get run over by a car, come to a slow or a sudden end.\n\n2:02:51.820 --> 2:02:56.820\n And I am more a supporter of just go out there.\n\n2:02:57.480 --> 2:02:59.280\n If you die, you die.\n\n2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:02.880\n And that's a, it's a balance you have to strike.\n\n2:03:02.880 --> 2:03:04.880\n I think there's a balance to strike\n\n2:03:04.880 --> 2:03:09.880\n in the longterm optimization and short term freedom.\n\n2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:15.320\n For me, for a programmer, for a programming mind,\n\n2:03:15.320 --> 2:03:18.240\n I tend to over optimize and I'm very cautious\n\n2:03:18.240 --> 2:03:21.440\n and afraid of that, to not over optimize\n\n2:03:21.440 --> 2:03:26.080\n and thereby be overly cautious, suboptimally cautious\n\n2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:27.520\n about everything I do.\n\n2:03:27.520 --> 2:03:30.360\n And that's the ultimate thing I'm trying to optimize for.\n\n2:03:30.360 --> 2:03:33.440\n It's funny you said like sleep and all those kinds of things.\n\n2:03:33.440 --> 2:03:38.440\n I tend to think, this is, you're being more precise\n\n2:03:38.440 --> 2:03:43.440\n than I am, but I think I tend to want to minimize stress,\n\n2:03:47.440 --> 2:03:49.900\n which everything comes into that from your sleep\n\n2:03:49.900 --> 2:03:50.860\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n2:03:50.860 --> 2:03:54.800\n But I worry that whenever I'm trying to be too strict\n\n2:03:54.800 --> 2:03:57.640\n with myself, then the stress goes up\n\n2:03:57.640 --> 2:04:00.520\n when I don't follow the strictness.\n\n2:04:00.520 --> 2:04:02.880\n And so you have to kind of, it's a weird,\n\n2:04:02.880 --> 2:04:05.680\n it's a, there's so many variables in an objective function\n\n2:04:05.680 --> 2:04:07.320\n as it's hard to get right.\n\n2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:09.640\n And sort of not giving a damn about sleep\n\n2:04:09.640 --> 2:04:11.940\n and not giving a damn about diet is a good thing\n\n2:04:11.940 --> 2:04:14.040\n to inject in there every once in a while\n\n2:04:14.040 --> 2:04:17.080\n for somebody who's trying to optimize everything.\n\n2:04:17.080 --> 2:04:20.240\n But that's me just trying to, it's exactly like you said,\n\n2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:22.700\n you're just a scientist, I'm a scientist of myself,\n\n2:04:22.700 --> 2:04:24.120\n you're a scientist of yourself.\n\n2:04:24.120 --> 2:04:25.800\n It'd be nice if somebody else was doing it\n\n2:04:25.800 --> 2:04:28.680\n and had much better data, because I don't trust\n\n2:04:28.680 --> 2:04:30.820\n my conscious mind and I pigged out last night\n\n2:04:30.820 --> 2:04:34.120\n at some brisket in LA that I regret deeply.\n\n2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:37.040\n It's just so, uh.\n\n2:04:37.040 --> 2:04:38.880\n There's no point to anything I just said.\n\n2:04:38.880 --> 2:04:39.720\n But.\n\n2:04:39.720 --> 2:04:40.540\n But.\n\n2:04:40.540 --> 2:04:45.080\n What is the nature of your regret on the brisket?\n\n2:04:46.680 --> 2:04:49.800\n Is it, do you wish you hadn't eaten it entirely?\n\n2:04:49.800 --> 2:04:51.800\n Is it that you wish you hadn't eaten as much as you did?\n\n2:04:51.800 --> 2:04:53.000\n Is it that?\n\n2:04:55.200 --> 2:04:58.520\n I think, well, the most regret, I mean,\n\n2:04:58.520 --> 2:05:03.520\n if we want to be specific, I drank way too much like that.\n\n2:05:03.520 --> 2:05:05.260\n Like diet soda.\n\n2:05:05.260 --> 2:05:08.100\n My biggest regret is like having drank so much diet soda.\n\n2:05:08.100 --> 2:05:10.380\n That's the thing that really was the problem.\n\n2:05:10.380 --> 2:05:12.160\n I had trouble sleeping because of that.\n\n2:05:12.160 --> 2:05:14.660\n Because I was like programming and then I was editing.\n\n2:05:14.660 --> 2:05:15.740\n And so I'd stay up late at night\n\n2:05:15.740 --> 2:05:18.500\n and then I had to get up to go pee a few times\n\n2:05:18.500 --> 2:05:19.460\n and it was just a mess.\n\n2:05:19.460 --> 2:05:20.360\n A mess of a night.\n\n2:05:20.360 --> 2:05:22.340\n It was, well, it's not really a mess,\n\n2:05:22.340 --> 2:05:25.980\n but like it's so many, it's like the little things.\n\n2:05:25.980 --> 2:05:30.100\n I know if I just eat, I drink a little bit of water\n\n2:05:30.100 --> 2:05:31.780\n and that's it, and there's a certain,\n\n2:05:31.780 --> 2:05:36.580\n all of us have perfect days that we know diet wise\n\n2:05:36.580 --> 2:05:39.180\n and so on that's good to follow, you feel good.\n\n2:05:39.180 --> 2:05:41.700\n I know what it takes for me to do that.\n\n2:05:41.700 --> 2:05:43.820\n I didn't fully do that and thereby,\n\n2:05:43.820 --> 2:05:47.660\n because there's an avalanche effect\n\n2:05:47.660 --> 2:05:50.140\n where the other sources of stress,\n\n2:05:50.140 --> 2:05:53.180\n all the other to do items I have piled on,\n\n2:05:53.180 --> 2:05:55.660\n my failure to execute on some basic things\n\n2:05:55.660 --> 2:05:58.860\n that I know make me feel good and all of that combines\n\n2:05:58.860 --> 2:06:02.460\n to create a mess of a day.\n\n2:06:02.460 --> 2:06:05.020\n But some of that chaos, you have to be okay with it,\n\n2:06:05.020 --> 2:06:07.900\n but some of it I wish was a little bit more optimal.\n\n2:06:07.900 --> 2:06:11.020\n And your ideas about eating in the morning\n\n2:06:11.020 --> 2:06:14.380\n are quite interesting as an experiment to try.\n\n2:06:14.380 --> 2:06:18.540\n Can you elaborate, are you eating once a day?\n\n2:06:18.540 --> 2:06:19.780\n Yes.\n\n2:06:19.780 --> 2:06:22.240\n In the morning and that's it.\n\n2:06:22.240 --> 2:06:24.380\n Can you maybe speak to how that,\n\n2:06:24.380 --> 2:06:29.380\n you spoke, it's funny, you spoke about the metrics of sleep,\n\n2:06:30.660 --> 2:06:34.780\n but you're also, you run a business,\n\n2:06:34.780 --> 2:06:36.180\n you're incredibly intelligent,\n\n2:06:36.180 --> 2:06:40.260\n mostly your happiness and success\n\n2:06:40.260 --> 2:06:43.240\n relies on you thinking clearly.\n\n2:06:43.240 --> 2:06:45.900\n So how does that affect your mind and your body\n\n2:06:45.900 --> 2:06:47.180\n in terms of performance?\n\n2:06:47.180 --> 2:06:50.020\n So not just sleep, but actual mental performance.\n\n2:06:50.980 --> 2:06:53.620\n As you were explaining your objective function of,\n\n2:06:53.620 --> 2:06:56.660\n for example, in the criteria you were including,\n\n2:06:56.660 --> 2:06:59.740\n you like certain neurochemical states,\n\n2:06:59.740 --> 2:07:02.520\n like you like feeling like you're living life,\n\n2:07:02.520 --> 2:07:04.580\n that life has enjoyment,\n\n2:07:04.580 --> 2:07:07.540\n that sometimes you want to disregard certain rules\n\n2:07:07.540 --> 2:07:10.220\n to have a moment of passion, of focus.\n\n2:07:10.220 --> 2:07:13.260\n There's this architecture of the way Lex is,\n\n2:07:13.260 --> 2:07:16.340\n which makes you happy as a story you tell,\n\n2:07:16.340 --> 2:07:17.740\n as something you kind of experience,\n\n2:07:17.740 --> 2:07:19.340\n maybe the experience is a bit more complicated,\n\n2:07:19.340 --> 2:07:22.500\n but it's in this idea you have, this is a version of you.\n\n2:07:22.500 --> 2:07:26.860\n And the reason why I maintain the schedule I do\n\n2:07:26.860 --> 2:07:29.620\n is I've chosen a game to say,\n\n2:07:29.620 --> 2:07:31.780\n I would like to live a life\n\n2:07:31.780 --> 2:07:36.220\n where I care more about what intelligent,\n\n2:07:37.740 --> 2:07:41.660\n what people who live in the year 2500\n\n2:07:41.660 --> 2:07:43.420\n think of me than I do today.\n\n2:07:44.780 --> 2:07:46.620\n That's the game I'm trying to play.\n\n2:07:46.620 --> 2:07:51.140\n And so therefore the only thing I really care about\n\n2:07:51.140 --> 2:07:56.140\n on this optimization is trying to see past myself,\n\n2:07:56.420 --> 2:07:59.700\n past my limitations, using zeroes principle thinking,\n\n2:08:01.060 --> 2:08:04.220\n pull myself out of this contextual mesh we're in right now\n\n2:08:04.220 --> 2:08:07.380\n and say, what will matter 100 years from now\n\n2:08:07.380 --> 2:08:08.460\n and 200 years from now?\n\n2:08:08.460 --> 2:08:11.220\n What are the big things really going on\n\n2:08:11.220 --> 2:08:13.300\n that are defining reality?\n\n2:08:13.300 --> 2:08:21.300\n And I find that if I were to hang out with Diet Soda Lex\n\n2:08:22.300 --> 2:08:24.940\n and Diet Soda Brian were to play along with that\n\n2:08:24.940 --> 2:08:28.500\n and my deep sleep were to get crushed as a result,\n\n2:08:28.500 --> 2:08:30.580\n my mind would not be on what matters\n\n2:08:30.580 --> 2:08:32.140\n in 100 years or 200 years or 300 years.\n\n2:08:32.140 --> 2:08:34.300\n I would be irritable.\n\n2:08:34.300 --> 2:08:37.460\n I would be, I'd be in a different state.\n\n2:08:37.460 --> 2:08:41.100\n And so it's just gameplay selection.\n\n2:08:41.100 --> 2:08:43.660\n It's what you and I have chosen to think about.\n\n2:08:43.660 --> 2:08:47.500\n It's what we've chosen to work on.\n\n2:08:47.500 --> 2:08:51.740\n And this is why I'm saying that no generation of humans\n\n2:08:51.740 --> 2:08:54.580\n have ever been afforded the opportunity\n\n2:08:54.580 --> 2:08:58.660\n to look at their lifespan and contemplate\n\n2:08:58.660 --> 2:09:03.180\n that they will have the possibility of experiencing\n\n2:09:03.180 --> 2:09:06.860\n an evolved form of consciousness that is undeniable.\n\n2:09:06.860 --> 2:09:10.980\n They would fall in a zero category of potential.\n\n2:09:10.980 --> 2:09:14.100\n That to me is the most exciting thing in existence.\n\n2:09:14.100 --> 2:09:19.100\n And I would not trade any momentary neurochemical state\n\n2:09:19.700 --> 2:09:21.500\n right now in exchange for that.\n\n2:09:21.500 --> 2:09:23.660\n I would, I'd be willing to deprive myself\n\n2:09:23.660 --> 2:09:27.060\n of all momentary joy in pursuit of that goal\n\n2:09:27.060 --> 2:09:28.860\n because that's what makes me happy.\n\n2:09:29.780 --> 2:09:30.780\n That's brilliant.\n\n2:09:30.780 --> 2:09:34.300\n But I'm a bit, I just looked it up.\n\n2:09:34.300 --> 2:09:38.620\n I'm with, I just looked up Braveheart's speech\n\n2:09:38.620 --> 2:09:41.780\n and William Wallace, but I don't know if you've seen it.\n\n2:09:41.780 --> 2:09:45.500\n Fight and you may die, run and you'll live at least a while.\n\n2:09:45.500 --> 2:09:48.020\n And dying in your beds many years from now,\n\n2:09:48.020 --> 2:09:51.420\n would you be willing to trade all the days\n\n2:09:51.420 --> 2:09:53.700\n from this day to that for one chance,\n\n2:09:53.700 --> 2:09:57.060\n just one chance, picture Mel Gibson saying this,\n\n2:09:57.060 --> 2:09:59.060\n to come back here and tell our enemies\n\n2:09:59.060 --> 2:10:03.700\n that they may take our lives with growing excitement,\n\n2:10:03.700 --> 2:10:06.380\n but they'll never take our freedom.\n\n2:10:06.380 --> 2:10:08.700\n I get excited every time I see that in the movie,\n\n2:10:08.700 --> 2:10:11.020\n but that's kind of how I approach life and eating.\n\n2:10:11.020 --> 2:10:13.140\n Do you think they were tracking their sleep?\n\n2:10:13.140 --> 2:10:14.460\n They were not tracking their sleep\n\n2:10:14.460 --> 2:10:16.180\n and they ate way too much brisket\n\n2:10:16.180 --> 2:10:19.420\n and they were fat, unhealthy, died early,\n\n2:10:19.420 --> 2:10:22.420\n and were primitive.\n\n2:10:22.420 --> 2:10:25.420\n But there's something in my ape brain\n\n2:10:25.420 --> 2:10:28.380\n that's attracted to that, even though most of my life\n\n2:10:29.340 --> 2:10:32.620\n is fully aligned with the way you see yours.\n\n2:10:32.620 --> 2:10:34.100\n Part of it is for comedy, of course,\n\n2:10:34.100 --> 2:10:38.820\n but part of it is I'm almost afraid of overoptimization.\n\n2:10:38.820 --> 2:10:39.860\n Really what you're saying though,\n\n2:10:39.860 --> 2:10:41.580\n if we're looking at this,\n\n2:10:41.580 --> 2:10:43.460\n let's say from a first principles perspective,\n\n2:10:43.460 --> 2:10:44.700\n when you read those words,\n\n2:10:44.700 --> 2:10:46.540\n they conjure up certain life experiences,\n\n2:10:46.540 --> 2:10:47.460\n but you're basically saying,\n\n2:10:47.460 --> 2:10:50.340\n I experienced a certain neurotransmitter state\n\n2:10:50.340 --> 2:10:53.060\n when these things are in action.\n\n2:10:53.060 --> 2:10:53.940\n That's all you're saying.\n\n2:10:53.940 --> 2:10:55.300\n So whether it's that or something else,\n\n2:10:55.300 --> 2:10:57.180\n you're just saying you have a selection\n\n2:10:57.180 --> 2:10:59.380\n for how your state for your body.\n\n2:10:59.380 --> 2:11:02.780\n And so if you as an engineer of consciousness,\n\n2:11:02.780 --> 2:11:05.180\n that should just be engineerable.\n\n2:11:05.180 --> 2:11:08.260\n And that's just triggering certain chemical reactions.\n\n2:11:08.260 --> 2:11:11.300\n And so it doesn't mean they have to be mutually exclusive.\n\n2:11:11.300 --> 2:11:12.980\n You can have that and experience that\n\n2:11:12.980 --> 2:11:15.780\n and also not sacrifice longterm health.\n\n2:11:15.780 --> 2:11:17.540\n And I think that's the potential of where we're going\n\n2:11:17.540 --> 2:11:22.540\n is we don't have to assume they are trade offs\n\n2:11:23.980 --> 2:11:25.660\n that must be had.\n\n2:11:25.660 --> 2:11:26.500\n Absolutely.\n\n2:11:26.500 --> 2:11:28.860\n And so I guess for my particular brain,\n\n2:11:28.860 --> 2:11:32.100\n it's useful to have the outlier experiences\n\n2:11:32.100 --> 2:11:35.660\n that also come along with the illusion of free will\n\n2:11:35.660 --> 2:11:37.780\n where I chose those experiences\n\n2:11:37.780 --> 2:11:39.540\n that make me feel like it's freedom.\n\n2:11:39.540 --> 2:11:42.380\n Listen, going to Texas made me realize I spent,\n\n2:11:42.380 --> 2:11:46.740\n so I still am, but I lived at Cambridge at MIT\n\n2:11:46.740 --> 2:11:49.140\n and I never felt like home there.\n\n2:11:49.140 --> 2:11:52.580\n I felt like home in the space of ideas with the colleagues,\n\n2:11:52.580 --> 2:11:54.340\n like when I was actually discussing ideas,\n\n2:11:54.340 --> 2:11:57.860\n but there is something about the constraints,\n\n2:11:58.780 --> 2:12:00.260\n how cautious people are,\n\n2:12:00.260 --> 2:12:05.140\n how much they valued also kind of a material success,\n\n2:12:05.140 --> 2:12:06.820\n career success.\n\n2:12:06.820 --> 2:12:11.820\n When I showed up to Texas, it felt like I belong.\n\n2:12:12.020 --> 2:12:14.740\n That was very interesting, but that's my neurochemistry,\n\n2:12:14.740 --> 2:12:17.260\n whatever the hell that is, whatever,\n\n2:12:17.260 --> 2:12:18.740\n maybe probably is rooted to the fact\n\n2:12:18.740 --> 2:12:20.060\n that I grew up in the Soviet Union\n\n2:12:20.060 --> 2:12:22.020\n and it was such a constrained system\n\n2:12:22.020 --> 2:12:23.940\n that you'd really deeply value freedom\n\n2:12:23.940 --> 2:12:27.420\n and you always want to escape the man\n\n2:12:27.420 --> 2:12:29.060\n and the control of centralized systems.\n\n2:12:29.060 --> 2:12:32.380\n I don't know what it is, but at the same time,\n\n2:12:32.380 --> 2:12:33.820\n I love strictness.\n\n2:12:33.820 --> 2:12:37.700\n I love the dogmatic authoritarianism of diet,\n\n2:12:38.620 --> 2:12:41.340\n of like the same habit, exactly the habit you have.\n\n2:12:41.340 --> 2:12:43.740\n I think that's actually when bodies perform optimally,\n\n2:12:43.740 --> 2:12:45.540\n my body performs optimally.\n\n2:12:45.540 --> 2:12:48.860\n So balancing those two, I think if I have the data,\n\n2:12:48.860 --> 2:12:51.620\n every once in a while, party with some wild people,\n\n2:12:51.620 --> 2:12:53.620\n but most of the time eat once a day,\n\n2:12:54.580 --> 2:12:56.220\n perhaps in the morning, I'm gonna try that.\n\n2:12:56.220 --> 2:12:57.900\n That might be very interesting,\n\n2:12:57.900 --> 2:12:59.980\n but I'd rather not try it.\n\n2:12:59.980 --> 2:13:03.100\n I'd rather have the data that tells me to do it.\n\n2:13:03.100 --> 2:13:07.180\n But in general, you're able to, eating once a day,\n\n2:13:07.180 --> 2:13:09.940\n think deeply about stuff like this.\n\n2:13:09.940 --> 2:13:13.860\n Concern that people have is like does your energy wane,\n\n2:13:13.860 --> 2:13:15.140\n all those kinds of things.\n\n2:13:15.140 --> 2:13:19.220\n Do you find that it's, especially because it's unique,\n\n2:13:19.220 --> 2:13:21.020\n it's vegan as well.\n\n2:13:21.020 --> 2:13:23.860\n So you find that you're able to have a clear mind,\n\n2:13:23.860 --> 2:13:27.740\n a focus, and just physically and mentally throughout?\n\n2:13:27.740 --> 2:13:29.820\n Yeah, and I find like my personal experience\n\n2:13:29.820 --> 2:13:34.820\n in thinking about hard things is,\n\n2:13:36.020 --> 2:13:40.180\n like oftentimes I feel like I'm looking through a telescope\n\n2:13:40.180 --> 2:13:42.260\n and like I'm aligning two or three telescopes.\n\n2:13:42.260 --> 2:13:44.100\n And you kind of have to close one eye\n\n2:13:44.100 --> 2:13:46.180\n and move it back and forth a little bit\n\n2:13:46.180 --> 2:13:47.940\n and just find just the right alignment.\n\n2:13:47.940 --> 2:13:49.820\n Then you find just a sneak peek\n\n2:13:49.820 --> 2:13:51.660\n at the thing you're trying to find, but it's fleeting.\n\n2:13:51.660 --> 2:13:54.780\n If you move just one little bit, it's gone.\n\n2:13:54.780 --> 2:13:58.820\n And oftentimes what I feel like are the ideas\n\n2:13:58.820 --> 2:14:00.620\n I value the most are like that.\n\n2:14:00.620 --> 2:14:05.620\n They're so fragile and fleeting and slippery and elusive.\n\n2:14:06.700 --> 2:14:11.700\n And it requires a sensitivity to thinking\n\n2:14:13.860 --> 2:14:16.500\n and a sensitivity to maneuver through these things.\n\n2:14:16.500 --> 2:14:21.500\n If I concede to a world where I'm on my phone texting,\n\n2:14:21.500 --> 2:14:22.340\n I'm also on social media.\n\n2:14:22.340 --> 2:14:25.340\n I'm also doing 15 things at the same time\n\n2:14:25.340 --> 2:14:26.380\n because I'm running a company\n\n2:14:26.380 --> 2:14:28.980\n and I'm also feeling terrible from the last night.\n\n2:14:30.620 --> 2:14:31.860\n It all just comes crashing down.\n\n2:14:31.860 --> 2:14:35.860\n And the quality of my thoughts goes to a zero.\n\n2:14:35.860 --> 2:14:40.100\n I'm a functional person to respond to basic level things,\n\n2:14:40.100 --> 2:14:43.260\n but I don't feel like I am doing anything interesting.\n\n2:14:44.940 --> 2:14:46.940\n I think that's a good word, sensitivity,\n\n2:14:46.940 --> 2:14:50.420\n because that's the word that's used the most.\n\n2:14:50.420 --> 2:14:53.860\n That's what thinking deeply feels like\n\n2:14:53.860 --> 2:14:55.820\n is you're sensitive to the fragile thoughts.\n\n2:14:55.820 --> 2:14:56.660\n And you're right.\n\n2:14:56.660 --> 2:14:59.100\n All those other distractions kind of dull\n\n2:14:59.100 --> 2:15:02.980\n your ability to be sensitive to the fragile thoughts.\n\n2:15:02.980 --> 2:15:04.180\n It's a really good word.\n\n2:15:05.540 --> 2:15:08.140\n Out of all the things you've done,\n\n2:15:08.140 --> 2:15:11.700\n you've also climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.\n\n2:15:13.100 --> 2:15:14.120\n Is this true?\n\n2:15:14.120 --> 2:15:14.960\n It's true.\n\n2:15:14.960 --> 2:15:19.960\n Why and how, and what do you take from that experience?\n\n2:15:25.680 --> 2:15:26.880\n I guess the backstory is relevant\n\n2:15:26.880 --> 2:15:31.880\n because in that moment, it was the darkest time in my life.\n\n2:15:32.440 --> 2:15:34.280\n I was ending a 13 year marriage.\n\n2:15:34.280 --> 2:15:35.320\n I was leaving my religion.\n\n2:15:35.320 --> 2:15:38.480\n I sold Braintree and I was battling depression\n\n2:15:38.480 --> 2:15:40.880\n where I was just at the end.\n\n2:15:40.880 --> 2:15:45.800\n And I got invited to go to Tanzania\n\n2:15:45.800 --> 2:15:47.120\n as part of a group that was raising money\n\n2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:49.400\n to build clean water wells.\n\n2:15:49.400 --> 2:15:51.560\n And I had made some money from Braintree,\n\n2:15:51.560 --> 2:15:54.480\n and so I was able to donate $25,000.\n\n2:15:54.480 --> 2:15:59.280\n And it was the first time I had ever had money to donate\n\n2:15:59.280 --> 2:16:01.720\n outside of paying tithing in my religion.\n\n2:16:01.720 --> 2:16:04.400\n It was such a phenomenal experience\n\n2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:09.400\n to contribute something meaningful to someone else\n\n2:16:09.400 --> 2:16:11.280\n in that form.\n\n2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:12.720\n And as part of this process,\n\n2:16:12.720 --> 2:16:13.800\n we were gonna climb the mountain.\n\n2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:16.600\n And so we went there and we saw the clean water wells\n\n2:16:16.600 --> 2:16:17.440\n we were building.\n\n2:16:17.440 --> 2:16:20.520\n We spoke to the people there and it was very energizing.\n\n2:16:20.520 --> 2:16:21.920\n And then we climbed Kilimanjaro\n\n2:16:21.920 --> 2:16:26.920\n and I came down with a stomach flu on day three.\n\n2:16:29.240 --> 2:16:30.720\n And I also had altitude sickness,\n\n2:16:30.720 --> 2:16:33.080\n but I became so sick that on day four,\n\n2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:34.760\n we are somebody on day five,\n\n2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:39.480\n I came into the camp, base camp at 15,000 feet,\n\n2:16:39.480 --> 2:16:42.840\n just going to the bathroom on myself\n\n2:16:42.840 --> 2:16:44.520\n and falling all over.\n\n2:16:44.520 --> 2:16:47.160\n I was just a disaster, I was so sick.\n\n2:16:47.160 --> 2:16:49.920\n So stomach flu and altitude sickness.\n\n2:16:49.920 --> 2:16:54.920\n Yeah, and I just was destroyed from the situation.\n\n2:16:57.120 --> 2:17:00.880\n Plus, it was psychologically one of the lowest points.\n\n2:17:00.880 --> 2:17:03.360\n Yeah, and I think that was probably a big contributor.\n\n2:17:03.360 --> 2:17:06.600\n I was just smoked as a human, just absolutely done.\n\n2:17:06.600 --> 2:17:07.760\n And I had three young children.\n\n2:17:07.760 --> 2:17:09.680\n And so I was trying to reconcile,\n\n2:17:09.680 --> 2:17:12.960\n this is not a, whether I live or not\n\n2:17:12.960 --> 2:17:14.920\n is not my decision by itself.\n\n2:17:14.920 --> 2:17:19.600\n I'm now intertwined with these three little people\n\n2:17:19.600 --> 2:17:22.960\n and I have an obligation whether I like it or not,\n\n2:17:22.960 --> 2:17:24.480\n I need to be there.\n\n2:17:24.480 --> 2:17:26.440\n And so it did, it felt like I was just stuck\n\n2:17:26.440 --> 2:17:27.680\n in a straight jacket.\n\n2:17:27.680 --> 2:17:32.240\n And I had to decide whether I was going to summit\n\n2:17:32.240 --> 2:17:34.120\n the next day with the team.\n\n2:17:35.280 --> 2:17:36.600\n And it was a difficult decision\n\n2:17:36.600 --> 2:17:38.200\n because once you start hiking,\n\n2:17:38.200 --> 2:17:40.800\n there's no way to get off the mountain.\n\n2:17:40.800 --> 2:17:44.000\n And a midnight came and our guide came in\n\n2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:44.960\n and he said, where are you at?\n\n2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:48.200\n And I said, I think I'm okay, I think I can try.\n\n2:17:48.200 --> 2:17:49.760\n And so we went.\n\n2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:54.760\n And so from midnight to, I made it to the summit at 5 a.m.\n\n2:17:56.840 --> 2:17:59.640\n It was one of the most transformational moments\n\n2:17:59.640 --> 2:18:00.960\n of my existence.\n\n2:18:00.960 --> 2:18:05.960\n And the mountain became my problem.\n\n2:18:06.560 --> 2:18:09.920\n It became everything that I was struggling with.\n\n2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:12.560\n And when I started hiking, it was,\n\n2:18:12.560 --> 2:18:17.560\n the pain got so ferocious that it was kind of like this.\n\n2:18:19.080 --> 2:18:24.080\n It became so ferocious that I turned my music to Eminem\n\n2:18:25.040 --> 2:18:26.920\n and it was, Eminem was the,\n\n2:18:26.920 --> 2:18:31.160\n he was the only person in existence that spoke to my soul.\n\n2:18:31.160 --> 2:18:33.680\n And it was something about his anger\n\n2:18:33.680 --> 2:18:38.040\n and his vibrancy and his multi eventually,\n\n2:18:38.040 --> 2:18:39.960\n he's the only person who I could turn on\n\n2:18:39.960 --> 2:18:42.760\n and I could just say, I feel some relief.\n\n2:18:42.760 --> 2:18:46.760\n I turned on Eminem and I made it to the summit\n\n2:18:46.760 --> 2:18:51.000\n after five hours, but just 100 yards from the top.\n\n2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:54.440\n I was with my guide Ike and I started getting very dizzy\n\n2:18:54.440 --> 2:18:56.960\n and I felt like I was gonna fall backwards\n\n2:18:56.960 --> 2:18:58.520\n off this cliff area we were on.\n\n2:18:58.520 --> 2:19:00.440\n I was like, this is dangerous.\n\n2:19:00.440 --> 2:19:03.520\n And he said, look, Brian, I know where you're at.\n\n2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:06.200\n I know where you're at.\n\n2:19:06.200 --> 2:19:08.400\n And I can tell you, you've got it in you.\n\n2:19:08.400 --> 2:19:13.400\n So I want you to look up, take a step, take a breath\n\n2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:16.520\n and look up, take a breath and take a step.\n\n2:19:16.520 --> 2:19:19.240\n And I did and I made it.\n\n2:19:19.240 --> 2:19:22.720\n And so I got there and I just sat down with him at the top.\n\n2:19:22.720 --> 2:19:24.200\n I just cried like a baby.\n\n2:19:24.200 --> 2:19:25.040\n Broke down.\n\n2:19:25.040 --> 2:19:26.720\n Yeah, I just lost it.\n\n2:19:26.720 --> 2:19:29.520\n And so he'd let me do my thing.\n\n2:19:29.520 --> 2:19:31.920\n And then we pulled out the pulse oximeter\n\n2:19:31.920 --> 2:19:33.240\n and he measured my blood oxygen levels\n\n2:19:33.240 --> 2:19:36.080\n and it was like 50 something percent\n\n2:19:36.080 --> 2:19:36.960\n and it was danger zone.\n\n2:19:36.960 --> 2:19:39.560\n So he looked at it and I think he was like really alarmed\n\n2:19:39.560 --> 2:19:41.160\n that I was in this situation.\n\n2:19:41.160 --> 2:19:44.840\n And so he said, we can't get a helicopter here\n\n2:19:44.840 --> 2:19:46.160\n and we can't get you emergency evacuated.\n\n2:19:46.160 --> 2:19:47.000\n You've gotta go down.\n\n2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:49.720\n You've gotta hike down to 15,000 feet to get base camp.\n\n2:19:49.720 --> 2:19:53.080\n And so we went out on the mountain.\n\n2:19:53.080 --> 2:19:55.000\n I got back down to base camp.\n\n2:19:55.000 --> 2:19:57.560\n And again, that was pretty difficult.\n\n2:19:57.560 --> 2:19:59.160\n And then they put me on a stretcher,\n\n2:19:59.160 --> 2:20:01.040\n this metal stretcher with this one wheel\n\n2:20:01.040 --> 2:20:04.680\n and a team of six people wheeled me down the mountain.\n\n2:20:04.680 --> 2:20:06.440\n And it was pretty torturous.\n\n2:20:06.440 --> 2:20:07.600\n I'm very appreciative they did.\n\n2:20:07.600 --> 2:20:09.080\n Also the trail was very bumpy.\n\n2:20:09.080 --> 2:20:10.240\n So they'd go over the big rocks.\n\n2:20:10.240 --> 2:20:11.880\n And so my head would just slam\n\n2:20:11.880 --> 2:20:14.880\n against this metal thing for hours.\n\n2:20:14.880 --> 2:20:15.960\n And so I just felt awful.\n\n2:20:15.960 --> 2:20:18.880\n Plus I'd get my head slammed every couple of seconds.\n\n2:20:18.880 --> 2:20:22.080\n So the whole experience was really a life changing moment.\n\n2:20:22.080 --> 2:20:25.040\n And that was the demarcation of me\n\n2:20:25.040 --> 2:20:26.680\n basically building a new life.\n\n2:20:26.680 --> 2:20:31.440\n Basically I said, I'm going to reconstruct Brian,\n\n2:20:31.440 --> 2:20:35.000\n my understanding of reality, my existential realities,\n\n2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:36.760\n what I want to go after.\n\n2:20:36.760 --> 2:20:39.640\n And I try, I mean, as much as that's possible as a human,\n\n2:20:39.640 --> 2:20:44.360\n but that's when I set out to rebuild everything.\n\n2:20:44.360 --> 2:20:46.040\n Was it the struggle of that?\n\n2:20:46.040 --> 2:20:50.840\n I mean, there's also just like the romantic poetic,\n\n2:20:50.840 --> 2:20:52.320\n it's a fricking mountain.\n\n2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:58.040\n There's a man in pain, psychological and physical\n\n2:20:58.040 --> 2:20:59.840\n struggling up a mountain.\n\n2:20:59.840 --> 2:21:03.960\n But it's just struggle, just in the face of,\n\n2:21:05.600 --> 2:21:09.800\n just pushing through in the face of hardship or nature too.\n\n2:21:09.800 --> 2:21:11.360\n Something much bigger than you.\n\n2:21:12.480 --> 2:21:14.880\n Is that, was that the thing that just clicked?\n\n2:21:14.880 --> 2:21:18.000\n For me, it felt like I was just locked in with reality\n\n2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:21.280\n and it was a death match.\n\n2:21:21.280 --> 2:21:24.040\n It was in that moment, one of us is going to die.\n\n2:21:24.040 --> 2:21:27.480\n So you were pondering death, like not surviving.\n\n2:21:27.480 --> 2:21:28.320\n Yep.\n\n2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:29.880\n And it was, and that was the moment.\n\n2:21:29.880 --> 2:21:32.280\n And it was, the summit to me was,\n\n2:21:33.720 --> 2:21:35.920\n I'm going to come out on top and I can do this.\n\n2:21:35.920 --> 2:21:40.640\n And giving in was, it's like, I'm just done.\n\n2:21:40.640 --> 2:21:43.400\n And so it did, I locked in and that's why,\n\n2:21:43.400 --> 2:21:47.640\n yeah, mountains are magical to me.\n\n2:21:49.200 --> 2:21:50.320\n I didn't expect that.\n\n2:21:50.320 --> 2:21:51.240\n I didn't design that.\n\n2:21:51.240 --> 2:21:52.960\n I didn't know that was going to be the case.\n\n2:21:52.960 --> 2:21:55.000\n I not, it would not have been something\n\n2:21:55.000 --> 2:21:56.280\n I would have anticipated.\n\n2:21:58.120 --> 2:22:00.320\n But you were not the same man afterwards.\n\n2:22:01.600 --> 2:22:02.840\n Yeah.\n\n2:22:02.840 --> 2:22:06.320\n Is there advice you can give to young people today\n\n2:22:06.320 --> 2:22:07.400\n that look at your story,\n\n2:22:07.400 --> 2:22:09.360\n that's successful in many dimensions,\n\n2:22:10.600 --> 2:22:13.240\n advice you can give to them about how to be successful\n\n2:22:13.240 --> 2:22:16.160\n in their career, successful in life,\n\n2:22:16.160 --> 2:22:17.840\n whatever path they choose?\n\n2:22:18.880 --> 2:22:22.560\n Yes, I would say, listen to advice\n\n2:22:22.560 --> 2:22:27.440\n and see it for what it is, a mirror of that person,\n\n2:22:28.840 --> 2:22:31.920\n and then map and know that your future\n\n2:22:31.920 --> 2:22:34.760\n is going to be in a zero principle land.\n\n2:22:34.760 --> 2:22:38.080\n And so what you're hearing today is a representation\n\n2:22:38.080 --> 2:22:39.800\n of what may have been the right principles\n\n2:22:39.800 --> 2:22:41.360\n to build upon previously,\n\n2:22:41.360 --> 2:22:45.680\n but they're likely depreciating very fast.\n\n2:22:45.680 --> 2:22:49.120\n And so I am a strong proponent\n\n2:22:49.120 --> 2:22:54.120\n that people ask for advice, but they don't take advice.\n\n2:22:57.280 --> 2:22:59.320\n So how do you take advice properly?\n\n2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:03.320\n It's in the careful examination of the advice.\n\n2:23:03.320 --> 2:23:06.600\n It's actually the person makes a statement\n\n2:23:06.600 --> 2:23:09.120\n about a given thing somebody should follow.\n\n2:23:09.120 --> 2:23:10.640\n The value is not doing that.\n\n2:23:10.640 --> 2:23:13.480\n The value is understanding the assumption stack they built,\n\n2:23:13.480 --> 2:23:15.320\n the assumption and knowledge stack they built\n\n2:23:15.320 --> 2:23:18.080\n around that body of knowledge.\n\n2:23:18.080 --> 2:23:18.920\n That's the value.\n\n2:23:18.920 --> 2:23:20.800\n It's not doing what they say.\n\n2:23:20.800 --> 2:23:25.080\n Considering the advice, but digging deeper\n\n2:23:25.080 --> 2:23:27.920\n to understand the assumption stack,\n\n2:23:27.920 --> 2:23:29.560\n like the full person,\n\n2:23:29.560 --> 2:23:32.400\n I mean, this is deep empathy, essentially,\n\n2:23:32.400 --> 2:23:34.200\n to understand the journey of the person\n\n2:23:34.200 --> 2:23:36.320\n that arrived at the advice.\n\n2:23:36.320 --> 2:23:39.040\n And the advice is just the tip of the iceberg\n\n2:23:39.040 --> 2:23:41.080\n that ultimately is not the thing that gives you.\n\n2:23:41.080 --> 2:23:43.560\n It could be the right thing to do.\n\n2:23:43.560 --> 2:23:45.080\n It could be the complete wrong thing to do\n\n2:23:45.080 --> 2:23:47.000\n depending on the assumption stack.\n\n2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:49.520\n So you need to investigate the whole thing.\n\n2:23:49.520 --> 2:23:54.080\n Is there some, are there been people in your startup\n\n2:23:54.080 --> 2:23:59.080\n and your business journey that have served that role\n\n2:23:59.360 --> 2:24:02.640\n of advice giver that's been helpful?\n\n2:24:02.640 --> 2:24:07.640\n Or do you feel like your journey felt like a lonely path?\n\n2:24:07.640 --> 2:24:11.520\n Or was it one that was, of course,\n\n2:24:11.520 --> 2:24:14.080\n we're all there born and die alone.\n\n2:24:15.240 --> 2:24:20.240\n But do you fundamentally remember the experiences,\n\n2:24:21.360 --> 2:24:23.960\n one where you leaned on people\n\n2:24:23.960 --> 2:24:26.920\n at a particular moment in time that changed everything?\n\n2:24:26.920 --> 2:24:30.840\n Yeah, the most significant moments of my memory,\n\n2:24:30.840 --> 2:24:33.040\n for example, like on Kilimanjaro,\n\n2:24:33.040 --> 2:24:38.040\n when Ike, some person I'd never met in Tanzania,\n\n2:24:38.160 --> 2:24:41.800\n was able to, in that moment, apparently see my soul\n\n2:24:41.800 --> 2:24:45.000\n when I was in this death match with reality.\n\n2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:48.680\n And he gave me the instructions, look up, step.\n\n2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:53.680\n And so there's magical people in my life\n\n2:24:54.880 --> 2:24:56.640\n that have done things like that.\n\n2:24:57.640 --> 2:25:00.760\n And I suspect they probably don't know.\n\n2:25:00.760 --> 2:25:04.480\n I probably should be better at identifying those things.\n\n2:25:04.480 --> 2:25:07.760\n And, but yeah, hopefully the,\n\n2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:18.960\n I suppose like the wisdom I would aspire to\n\n2:25:18.960 --> 2:25:22.920\n is to have the awareness and the empathy\n\n2:25:22.920 --> 2:25:24.920\n to be that for other people.\n\n2:25:24.920 --> 2:25:29.920\n And not a retail advertiser of advice,\n\n2:25:33.640 --> 2:25:38.640\n of tricks for life, but deeply meaningful\n\n2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:41.800\n and empathetic with a one on one context\n\n2:25:41.800 --> 2:25:44.400\n with people that it really can make a difference.\n\n2:25:45.560 --> 2:25:47.400\n Yeah, I actually kind of experience,\n\n2:25:47.400 --> 2:25:49.040\n I think about that sometimes.\n\n2:25:49.040 --> 2:25:51.560\n You have like an 18 year old kid come up to you.\n\n2:25:51.560 --> 2:25:56.080\n And it's not always obvious,\n\n2:25:56.080 --> 2:26:00.120\n it's not always easy to really listen to them.\n\n2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:04.600\n Like not the facts, but like see who that person is.\n\n2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:07.040\n I think people say that about being a parent\n\n2:26:07.040 --> 2:26:10.840\n is you want to consider that,\n\n2:26:11.960 --> 2:26:14.200\n you don't want to be the authority figure\n\n2:26:14.200 --> 2:26:16.040\n in the sense that you really want to consider\n\n2:26:16.040 --> 2:26:18.720\n that there's a special unique human being there\n\n2:26:18.720 --> 2:26:23.520\n with a unique brain that may be brilliant\n\n2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:25.520\n in ways that you are not understanding\n\n2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:29.360\n that you'll never be and really try to hear that.\n\n2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:31.640\n So when giving advice, there's something to that.\n\n2:26:31.640 --> 2:26:34.000\n It's a both sides should be deeply empathetic\n\n2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:35.440\n about the assumption stack.\n\n2:26:36.880 --> 2:26:38.800\n I love that terminology.\n\n2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:42.520\n What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing of life?\n\n2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:46.080\n Why the hell are we here, Brian Johnson?\n\n2:26:46.080 --> 2:26:48.320\n We've been talking about brains and studying brains\n\n2:26:48.320 --> 2:26:51.440\n and you had this very eloquent way of describing life\n\n2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:55.400\n on Earth as an optimization problem\n\n2:26:55.400 --> 2:26:59.400\n of the cost of intelligence going to zero.\n\n2:26:59.400 --> 2:27:01.760\n At first through the evolutionary process\n\n2:27:01.760 --> 2:27:04.140\n and then eventually through building,\n\n2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:06.720\n through our technology,\n\n2:27:06.720 --> 2:27:09.280\n building more and more intelligent systems.\n\n2:27:09.280 --> 2:27:13.600\n You ever ask yourself why is doing that?\n\n2:27:13.600 --> 2:27:17.440\n Yeah, I think the answer to this question,\n\n2:27:17.440 --> 2:27:21.640\n again, the information value is more in the mirror\n\n2:27:21.640 --> 2:27:24.360\n it provides of that person,\n\n2:27:24.360 --> 2:27:26.960\n which is a representation of the technological,\n\n2:27:26.960 --> 2:27:30.120\n social, political context of the time.\n\n2:27:30.120 --> 2:27:32.240\n So if you ask this question a hundred years ago,\n\n2:27:32.240 --> 2:27:33.280\n you would get a certain answer\n\n2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:35.040\n that reflects that time period.\n\n2:27:35.040 --> 2:27:36.960\n Same thing would be true of a thousand years ago.\n\n2:27:36.960 --> 2:27:40.920\n It's rare, it's difficult for a person to pull themselves\n\n2:27:40.920 --> 2:27:43.080\n out of their contextual awareness\n\n2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:45.240\n and offer a truly original response.\n\n2:27:45.240 --> 2:27:48.520\n And so knowing that I am contextually influenced\n\n2:27:48.520 --> 2:27:52.400\n by the situation, that I am a mirror for our reality,\n\n2:27:52.400 --> 2:27:54.240\n I would say that in this moment,\n\n2:27:55.160 --> 2:27:59.160\n I think the real game going on\n\n2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:06.280\n is that evolution built a system\n\n2:28:07.920 --> 2:28:10.600\n of scaffolding intelligence that produced us.\n\n2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:13.880\n We are now building intelligence systems\n\n2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:18.880\n that are scaffolding higher dimensional intelligence,\n\n2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:23.480\n that's developing more robust systems of intelligence.\n\n2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:32.680\n In doing in that process with the cost going to zero,\n\n2:28:32.680 --> 2:28:37.680\n then the meaning of life becomes goal alignment,\n\n2:28:37.680 --> 2:28:41.520\n which is the negotiation of our conscious\n\n2:28:41.520 --> 2:28:43.680\n and unconscious existence.\n\n2:28:43.680 --> 2:28:45.040\n And then I'd say the third thing is,\n\n2:28:45.040 --> 2:28:47.800\n if we're thinking that we wanna be explorers\n\n2:28:48.800 --> 2:28:52.920\n is our technological progress is getting to a point\n\n2:28:52.920 --> 2:28:57.240\n where we could aspirationally say,\n\n2:28:57.240 --> 2:29:01.240\n we want to figure out what is really going on,\n\n2:29:01.240 --> 2:29:06.240\n really going on, because does any of this really make sense?\n\n2:29:06.600 --> 2:29:09.200\n Now we may be a hundred, 200, 500, a thousand years away\n\n2:29:09.200 --> 2:29:14.200\n from being able to poke our way out of whatever is going on.\n\n2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:20.120\n But it's interesting that we could even state an aspiration\n\n2:29:20.120 --> 2:29:22.960\n to say, we wanna poke at this question.\n\n2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:26.000\n But I'd say in this moment of time,\n\n2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:30.680\n the meaning of life is that we can build a future state\n\n2:29:31.880 --> 2:29:35.200\n of existence that is more fantastic\n\n2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:37.120\n than anything we could ever imagine.\n\n2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:41.960\n The striving for something more amazing.\n\n2:29:43.640 --> 2:29:48.640\n And that defies expectations that we would consider\n\n2:29:50.920 --> 2:29:55.720\n bewildering and all the things that that's,\n\n2:29:55.720 --> 2:29:57.280\n and I guess the last thing,\n\n2:29:57.280 --> 2:29:59.120\n if there's multiple meanings of life,\n\n2:29:59.120 --> 2:30:00.480\n it would be infinite games.\n\n2:30:00.480 --> 2:30:01.960\n James Kars wrote the book,\n\n2:30:01.960 --> 2:30:04.120\n Finite Games, Infinite Games.\n\n2:30:04.120 --> 2:30:08.600\n The only game to play right now is to keep playing the game.\n\n2:30:09.640 --> 2:30:11.400\n And so this goes back to the algorithm\n\n2:30:11.400 --> 2:30:14.640\n of the Lex algorithm of diet soda and brisket\n\n2:30:14.640 --> 2:30:16.200\n and pursuing the passion.\n\n2:30:16.200 --> 2:30:19.320\n What I'm suggesting is there's a moment here\n\n2:30:19.320 --> 2:30:22.560\n where we can contemplate playing infinite games.\n\n2:30:22.560 --> 2:30:25.840\n Therefore, it may make sense to err on the side\n\n2:30:25.840 --> 2:30:27.720\n of making sure one is in a situation\n\n2:30:27.720 --> 2:30:31.240\n to be playing infinite games if that opportunity arises.\n\n2:30:31.240 --> 2:30:35.320\n So the landscape of possibility is changing very, very fast\n\n2:30:35.320 --> 2:30:37.000\n and therefore our old algorithms\n\n2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:38.440\n of how we might assess risk assessment\n\n2:30:38.440 --> 2:30:39.280\n and what things we might pursue\n\n2:30:39.280 --> 2:30:42.640\n and why those assumptions may fall away very quickly.\n\n2:30:44.120 --> 2:30:46.120\n Well, I think I speak for a lot of people\n\n2:30:46.120 --> 2:30:50.520\n when I say that the game you, Mr. Brian Johnson,\n\n2:30:50.520 --> 2:30:53.200\n have been playing is quite
